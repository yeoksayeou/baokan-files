    Wuhan Publicly Tries Corrupt Officials and Big Profiteers
    Over 200,000 People Listen to Live Broadcasts, Urging Severe Punishment for These Criminals; The Masses Call the Conference Over 700 Times to Report and Confess Corruption Incidents
    The Wuhan People's Court held a public trial on the 18th, publicly trying corrupt elements such as Cui Mingqing, Lu Jichang, and Sun Baosheng, and illegal merchants such as Teng Zhenlu, Hu Yuting, Yang Jianquan, and Yu Chengzhi. Participating in the conference were 12,000 representatives from various organs, enterprises, military units, and people from all walks of life in the Central South Region, Hubei Province, and Wuhan City. Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Wu Defeng, Mayor of Wuhan, personally attended. The conference also held a live broadcast. More than 240,000 people listened in various factories, shops, and streets outside the venue.
    After Li Bogang, Secretary-General of the Wuhan Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, announced the opening of the conference, Wu Jie, Chief Prosecutor of the Wuhan Municipal People's Procuratorate, presented the public prosecution, listing the various crimes of each defendant.
    The corrupt criminal Cui Mingqing was the former chief of the business section of the Wuhan Municipal Department Store. He and Lu Jichang, the head of the business section of the Second Wholesale Department, and others used their positions to embezzle a total of 179,073,100 yuan. The profiteer Teng Zhenlu, manager of Wu Wenji Paper Store, colluded with Cui, Lu, and others to steal national property through illegal means such as selling national processed paper, replacing good national paper with inferior waste paper, and evading taxes, amounting to 1,519,671,270 yuan; he also stole national property through other fraudulent means amounting to 60,774,400 yuan. The profiteer Hu Yuting is the manager of Wuhan Shunfeng Hardware Store, Yang Jianquan is the manager of Wuhan Chongxin Hardware Store, and Yu Chengzhi is the manager of Wuhan Dachang Tin and Copper Store. They colluded with corrupt elements such as Sun Baosheng, a material inspector at the Hengyang Railway Administration, to defraud national property. Sun Baosheng was a retained employee. In August and October 1950, the Wuchang Branch Material Factory of the Hengyang Railway Administration successively ordered alloys used on locomotives from Shunfeng, Chongxin Hardware Stores, and Dachang Tin and Copper Store. In order to seek exorbitant profits, these hardware stores disregarded national laws and disciplines, organized 34 hardware stores including Shenchang, Yuansheng, and Gongli, and 38 peddlers including Zheng Yunmiao and Song Weixin, to bribe Sun Baosheng twice, using tin, manganese, antimony, lead and other impure metals to cast alloys, and used despicable means of collectively raising bids to defraud the state of nearly 700 million yuan. All the representatives at the venue felt extremely angry about the crimes of corrupt elements Cui Mingqing, Sun Baosheng, and profiteers Teng Zhenlu, Hu Yuting, and others in stealing national property. Dan Eqin, a clerk in the business section of the Wuhan Municipal Department Store, Zhou Wenbo, director of the paper industry of the Industry and Commerce Association, and others took the stage to accuse Cui Mingqing, Teng Zhenlu, and other criminals of their crimes. Sun Shuwen, a driver at the Liaison Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee, also revealed the ugly face of his uncle Sun Baosheng's consistent embezzlement and perversion of the law. During his accusation, Dan Eqin listed Cui Mingqing's eight major crimes, leaving Cui speechless. Zhou Wenbo historically exposed the profiteer Teng Zhenlu's speculative, bribery and fraudulent behavior, saying: Teng Zhenlu has always manipulated and monopolized the paper industry, but in the people's country, his despicable means will definitely be punished.
    When worker representative Li Qixin spoke, in addition to requesting the People's Government to severely punish corrupt elements such as Cui Mingqing and profiteers such as Teng Zhenlu, he also called on all workers in the city, especially shop workers, to boldly report and expose the illegal behavior of corrupt elements and profiteers with the spirit of being masters of the country. When industry and commerce representative He Hengfu spoke, he asked all industry and commerce circles to learn lessons from cases such as profiteers Teng Zhenlu and Hu Yuting, continue to carry out the anti-bribery, anti-fraud, anti-tax evasion, and anti-theft movement, and hoped that worker comrades would help people in the industry and commerce circles carry out ideological reform.
    After the representatives from all walks of life spoke, Judge Zhang Xuetao expressed his opinion on the handling of the cases of Cui Mingqing and Sun Baosheng. He said: All acts of corruption and theft of state property are illegal and should be appropriately punished according to the seriousness of the circumstances. All corrupt elements and thieves who steal state property, and law-breaking industrialists and businessmen, except for those with heinous crimes, can be given lenient punishment if they can make automatic and thorough confessions; those with minor offenses can be exempted from punishment. If, in addition to their own confessions, they can also report other corrupt elements and law-breaking industrialists and businessmen, they can offset their crimes depending on the situation. Those who are stubborn and refuse to confess will be doubly punished. The cases of Cui Mingqing, Teng Zhenlu, Sun Baosheng, Hu Yuting, and other criminals will be handled according to this principle. All the representatives at the venue unanimously and enthusiastically applauded to express their support for Judge Zhang Xuetao's opinion.
    Finally, Mayor Wu Defeng and Comrade Zhang Pinghua spoke successively. Mayor Wu pointed out: The bourgeoisie's rampant attack on the revolutionary camp over the past three years has been proven in these two cases today. From here, we can see how despicable, shameless, and ugly the bourgeoisie's nature of only seeking profit and harming others is! At the same time, it also shows that some elements within our revolutionary ranks could not withstand the test, were eroded by bourgeois ideology, and lost their revolutionary qualities, resulting in corruption. Therefore, all organs in the city must continue to carry out the "Three-Anti" movement, and the industrial and commercial circles must continue to carry out the anti-bribery, anti-fraud, anti-tax evasion, and anti-theft movement, boldly report, bravely confess, and at the same time, through ideological reform, resolutely counterattack the ugly bourgeois offensive. Cleanse the filth of the old society. Comrade Zhang Pinghua pointed out in his speech: The cases of Cui Mingqing and Sun Baosheng are just two typical examples of corrupt elements and profiteers in the city. Our responsibility is not only to handle these corrupt elements and illegal businessmen according to law, but also to eliminate corruption, bribery, tax evasion, fraud, and theft of state property in the city. The bourgeoisie uses sugar-coated bullets to attack us, and profiteers are the gunners. All the people of Wuhan should further mobilize and open fire on these gunners, and push the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement to a climax. The people's democratic united front led by the Chinese Communist Party is an invincible and powerful force, and it will definitely achieve victory.
    After the meeting, profiteer Teng Zhenlu and corrupt criminals Cui Mingqing, Sun Baosheng, and others were escorted back to the Municipal People's Court to await punishment.
    More than 240,000 listeners throughout the city felt resentment and hatred after hearing the crimes of these corrupt elements and profiteers from the broadcast. They called the conference one after another, unanimously requesting the People's Government to severely punish these profiteers and corrupt elements. More than 500 workers at the private Yuhua Yarn Factory in Wuhan listened to the broadcast while working in the workshop.
    From the specific crimes of these three lawbreakers, the masses inside and outside the venue further recognized the despicable and hateful nature of corrupt elements and profiteers. Therefore, they came forward to report them. In front of the three reporting stations specially set up at the venue, the people who came to report were endless. During the four hours of the public trial, representatives from all walks of life exposed a total of 73 incidents of corruption and bribery. The telephones around the rostrum of the public trial conference rang non-stop. The masses who listened to the conference made more than 750 calls to the conference. They reported or confessed corruption cases on the phone. After the public trial was over, more than 130 people inside and outside the venue reported the corruption and bribery incidents they knew or confessed their own corruption and bribery behaviors on the spot. All the listeners unanimously demanded severe punishment for corrupt elements and illegal businessmen, and expressed that they would resolutely counterattack the bourgeoisie's attack on the revolutionary camp.

    武汉市公审贪污犯和大奸商
    二十多万人收听实况广播纷纷要求严惩这些罪犯群众向大会打了七百多次电话检举坦白贪污事件
    武汉市人民法院十八日举行公审大会，公审崔明卿、陆继昌、孙宝生等贪污分子和滕镇鲁、胡玉亭、杨鉴泉、俞成志等不法商人。参加大会的有中南区、湖北省、武汉市各机关、企业、部队和各界人民代表一万二千人。中共武汉市委书记张平化、武汉市市长吴德峰都亲自出席。大会并举行了实况广播。有二十四万余人在会外各个工厂、商店、街道收听。
    大会由武汉市各界人民代表会议协商委员会秘书长李伯刚宣布开会后，由武汉市人民检察署检察长吴杰提出公诉，并历举各犯各种罪行。
    贪污罪犯崔明卿，是武汉市百货公司业务科前任科长。他和第二批发部经营股股长陆继昌等人利用职权，先后贪污达一亿七千九百零七万三千一百元。奸商邬文记纸号经理滕镇鲁勾结崔、陆等犯，以盗卖国家加工纸张，以低劣碎纸偷换国家好纸和偷漏税款等非法手段盗窃国家财产达十五亿一千九百六十七万一千二百七十元；还采取其他欺诈手段偷盗国家财产六千零七十七万四千四百元。奸商胡玉亭是武汉市顺丰五金号的经理，杨鉴泉是武汉市崇信五金号的经理，俞成志是武汉市大昌铜锡号经理，他们勾结了衡阳铁路管理局鉴料人孙宝生等贪污分子骗取国家财产。孙宝生是个留用人员，一九五○年八月和十月衡阳铁路管理局武昌分局材料厂先后向顺丰、崇信五金号和大昌铜锡号订购机车上使用的合金，这几家五金号为贪图暴利，竟藐视国家法纪，组织慎昌、元生、公利等三十四家五金店和跑街郑云庙、宋维新等三十八人，两次贿赂孙宝生，以锡、锰、锑、铅等杂质金属掺铸取巧，并以集体抬标的卑鄙手段诈骗国家财产近七亿元。全场代表对贪污分子崔明卿、孙宝生，奸商滕镇鲁、胡玉亭等盗窃国家财产的罪行，感到极大的忿恨。武汉市百货公司业务科职员单鄂钦，工商联纸张业主任委员周文波等纷纷上台控诉崔明卿、滕镇鲁等犯的罪行。中南军政委员会交际处司机孙树文并揭露了他叔叔孙宝生的一贯贪赃枉法的丑恶面目。单鄂钦在控诉时，列举崔明卿八大罪状，使崔犯哑口无言。周文波从历史上揭发奸商滕镇鲁投机倒把、贿赂诈骗的卑劣行为，他说：滕镇鲁在纸业中一贯操纵垄断，但是在人民的国家里他这种卑劣的手段是
    一定会受到惩罚的。
    工人代表李启新发言时除要求人民政府将崔明卿等贪污分子和滕镇鲁等奸商予以严厉惩处外，并号召全市工人，特别是店员工人要以主人翁的精神，大胆检举揭发贪污分子与奸商的不法行为。工商界代表贺衡夫在发言时，要求全体工商界应从奸商滕镇鲁、胡玉亭等案件中吸取教训，继续开展反行贿、反欺诈、反偷漏、反盗窃运动，并希望工人同志帮助工商界人士进行思想改造。
    各界代表发言后，审判长张雪涛发表对崔明卿和孙宝生案件处理的意见。他说：一切贪污和盗窃国家财产的行为，都是犯法的，都应按情节轻重分别受到适当处分。一切贪污分子和盗窃国家财产的蟊贼，犯法的工商业者，除罪大恶极者外，如能作自动的彻底的坦白，则重者可以酌予减罪，轻者可以免予治罪。如果在自己坦白之外，还能检举其他贪污分子和犯法的工商业者，可看情况将功折罪。顽固不化，拒不坦白者加倍处分。对崔明卿、滕镇鲁、孙宝生、胡玉亭等犯就照这个原则处理。全场代表，对审判长张雪涛的意见一致热烈鼓掌表示拥护。
    最后，吴德峰市长和张平化同志相继讲话。吴市长指出：资产阶级三年来向革命阵营猖狂的进攻，在今天这二个案件中得到了证明，从这里，我们可以看到资产阶级唯利是图、损人利己的本质是如何的卑鄙无耻和丑恶！同时也看出我们革命队伍内部还有某些分子，经不住考验，受了资产阶级思想的侵蚀，丧失了革命品质，发生了贪污腐化行为。因此全市各机关必须继续开展“三反”运动，工商界必须继续开展反行贿、反欺诈、反偷漏、反盗窃运动，大胆检举、勇敢坦白，同时通过思想改造向丑恶的资产阶级的进攻进行坚决的反击。把旧社会的污毒洗刷干净。张平化同志讲话时指出：崔明卿、孙宝生案件，只是全市贪污分子和奸商的两个典型，我们的责任不仅是要依法处理这些贪污分子和不法商人，更大的责任是要在全市肃清贪污、行贿、偷漏、欺诈、盗窃国家财产现象。资产阶级用糖衣炮弹向我们进攻，奸商就是炮手。武汉市全体人民应进一步动员起来，向这些炮手开火，把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动推向高潮。中国共产党领导的人民民主统一战线，是一支不可战胜的强大力量，是一定能取得胜利的。
    会后，奸商滕镇鲁和贪污犯崔明卿、孙宝生等被押回市人民法院听候惩罚。
    全市二十四万多个听众从广播中听到这些贪污分子和奸商的罪行后，无不切齿痛恨。纷纷给大会打电话，一致要求人民政府严办这些奸商和贪污分子。武汉市私营裕华纱厂五百多工人一面在车间做活，一面收听广播。
    会内外群众从这三个不法分子的具体罪行中，更加认识了贪污分子和奸商的卑鄙、可恶。因此纷纷起来检举。在会场特设的三个检举台前，检举的人川流不息。在公审的四小时内，各界代表揭发的贪污、行贿事件共有七十三件。公审大会主席台周围的八部电话机铃声响个不停，收听的群众向大会打了七百五十多次电话，他们在电话中检举或坦白贪污案件。公审完毕后，会内会外就有一百三十多人当场检举他们所知道的贪污、行贿事件或坦白自己的贪污、行贿行为。所有的听众一致要求严惩贪污分子和不法商人，并表示对资产阶级向革命阵营的进攻要坚决进行反攻。　（综）
