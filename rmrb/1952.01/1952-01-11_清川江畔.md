　　On the Banks of the Chongchon River
　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Hua Shan

　　The sun is setting, and Anju is getting closer and closer. The car is practically flying—the Daening River and the Chongchon River are just ahead.

　　From here to the front lines, you have to take a boat instead of a bridge, and cross the open fields between the two rivers, which is where enemy planes have been stubbornly attacking for the past year. The familiar sound of dive-bombing and strafing did indeed ring out at this moment.

　　On the other side of the mountain, several "Mustang" planes were tumbling up and down, but in front of me it was bare, with only dust rolling along behind the car, shining golden in the sun, stretching for miles. The situation was quite tense. The faster the car ran, the fiercer the dust cloud rushed, and the headwind made it hard to breathe. The yellow dust even rolled into the carriage and rushed towards the front of the car, stubbornly trying to take the road. Seeing its aggressive appearance, I felt more at ease. At this moment, I remembered the story of another truck fighting with enemy planes. That large truck, which was chased by enemy planes for more than ten miles, managed to advance victoriously because of this cloud of dust. At first, it fought with the enemy planes on the mountain road, sometimes speeding up and sometimes stopping suddenly, circling the mountainside, diving into the bushes, and dodging the bullets from three dive-bombing attacks. The enemy planes still refused to give up and followed it to the plains. The driver wanted to take advantage of the gap when the enemy planes were circling to aim, and cross the plains in one go, but the road was too long, and four "Mustangs" had already lined up in a dive-bombing formation. Seeing that there was no way to escape, he simply slammed on the accelerator and ran as fast as he could, until the enemy plane dived straight down, then he slammed on the brakes. Unexpectedly, the dust continued to rush forward, rushing out a mile or two. The enemy plane took the dust cloud as the target for strafing and bombing, and fired a barrage of shots, creating a smoky atmosphere. He also turned the car around in the shady area filled with dust and "left without saying goodbye."

　　Now our driver is stepping on the gas, obviously full of confidence. But the enemy planes didn't dare to come, and a burst of fierce anti-aircraft fire reverberated over the river. The "Mustang cubs" disappeared without a trace. Only then did I realize that there were particularly many bomb craters in this area, and the scenery of the wilderness was also surprisingly wonderful.

　　The rows of winter wheat undulated on the huge bomb craters, so neat and even that it seemed as if the bomb craters had drilled themselves under the wheat rows. A large area of new bomb craters夹着the road. The openings of the several pits close to the road were semi-circular, which I had never seen before. It seemed that each bomb that fell into the roadside ditch only exploded halfway, while the other half was压着by the wide and straight highway. The steep bank at the bridgehead had been blasted into a gentle slope, and the sandy beach on the opposite bank had also been blasted into a river bend. However, the wide highway bridge just happened to be架here. The piers were made of tree stumps, wooden sleepers, piled up with stones and sandbags, and架on the cement stumps. The highway dams on the water were also patched with new grass bags over old grass bags, and wooden piles and sand embankments补着cement and stone embankments. At first glance, they reminded me of old soldiers with battle wounds all over their bodies. The wooden bridge deck was so strong and flat, and the紧衔着的 embankment road surface was also so straight and flat that it was hard to see any traces of bombs. When the car drove into the mountain gully, I arrived in a wonderful cave world again.

　　This is one of the many supply stations on the Volunteer Army's supply line. At first glance, the surroundings are just small hills covered with trees, with no houses or fields. The car has already reached the end. Turning a corner, a newly opened loess highway appears,穿进the pine forest on the mountain. The newly built bomb shelters are scattered along the way. The entrance is only as wide as an infantry trench, but inside is an underground field warehouse filled with a train car of materials. There are underground bedrooms, underground bathhouses, underground conference halls, ... When I walked into a "battlefield guest room," it was so hot that I couldn't wear my overcoat and cotton clothes.

　　"Unexpected, right?" The host夸耀proudly said to me. Looking up from the side of the stream: here the pine forest is sparse, the chestnut trees are枯黄, and several gray eaves伏on the hillside, but there are no roofs or doors. The white smoke from the chimneys is呼呼地冒着under the rocks. Walking closer, the slope under the eaves also reveals a short row of paper windows, and a wooden door is also朝南开着, but it is躲in the breast wall of the trench,遮挡by the earthen slope. The trench is only a little wider than the shoulders, and you only need to avoid lowering your head when entering the door. It's hard to imagine that the inside is so spacious: a fire kang, a floor, a sofa made of a broken car cushion in front of the desk, the four walls are打着with thick pine tree桩子standing close to each other, and the ceiling is also架着with原棵tree trunks. The roof is灌着with cement and盖着with thick soil, just like the original hillside. The entire house is completely buried in the soil, and only the paper windows are exposed above the ground. The cement-topped wooden pile eaves also protect the outside,不怕enemy planes strafing and bombing, let alone wind and rain,阴暗and dampness.

　　"This is not like when we first went abroad!" the host said. At that time, enemy planes搅that we couldn't enter the village during the day, and there was nowhere to stay in the snowy fields. We dug a small pit in the shady area,铺bundled稻草, and钻into it like a chicken coop. Once we lay down, we couldn't lift our heads. A nap would freeze our legs and ache our backs. We also worked all night. We didn't sleep well all winter. It was hard until the trees were all green, we could sleep in the fields, and it was easy to dig caves. As soon as the rainy season came, it was a mess. Heavy rain淋淋淋on our heads, and mountain water冲冲冲under our feet. The air raid shelter also leaked, and floods漫漫漫to the eaves. We put up tents in high places, but it was still "外面大下，里面小下;外面不下，里面还滴哒." At that time, we were抢运grain and ammunition in the mud and water every day. When we went back, we just thought: even if we could sleep on a warm kang for one night, we wouldn't feel tired after doing it for seven days and seven nights. "Now America can bomb as much as it wants," the host lit the candle and admired the house, "we are also going to install electric lights and钉板壁,气死the Americans!"

　　"What is this?" I picked up the candlestick on the table. The host was even more得意, "This is also called '气死America'!" He拆开the candlestick. It turned out that it was made of three rings of airplane bullets扣套on four-legged nails. The four-legged nails are two弓形钢管welded crosswise, as thick as a little finger, with the nail heads sharpened and connected to each other. When thrown on the ground, there are always three feet贴地standing, and one朝天. When car wheels roll over it, they will definitely扎透it and泄出the air. The last time the United States attacked Okinawa Island, they were弄得nowhere to go because of Japanese four-legged nails. Now the enemy is走on the old path of Japanese寇's invasion, and is playing this trick in Korea, with even more tricks: at dusk, enemy planes顺着the highway,扔四脚钉everywhere. Then, estimating that our cars have抛锚and are堵full of intersections, enemy planes will跑来“挂灯”, throwing dozens of flares overhead,照个通明a mile or two of the highway, and “放烟花的”will come to投弹strafe, taking out杀伤弹,燃烧弹, and子母炸弹. But it can’t斗过 us no matter how many tricks it plays. There are air defense哨every three里and five里along the highway,布满了the entire front and rear of the battlefield. As soon as enemy planes arrive overhead, the soldiers跟着the planes屁股and chase them, you chase one段, and I chase one段. No matter where the enemy planes go, there are air defense 哨盯着屁股and chasing them. As soon as they find four-legged nails, they扫them to the side of the road. After they finish throwing them, we扫them clean. The cars still呼呼地跑着.

　　"Just look at where we live, and you'll know how many tricks enemy planes have played this year," the host said幽默地. Rock caves, these were爆开with the explosives from time bombs. Room-sized生丝mosquito nets, these are made of the parachutes of flares. The bookshelf摆in the corner of the room is made of the thin shell of子母炸弹. It is as tall as the eyebrows, and has three layers of横格in its belly. It was originally filled with dozens of small bombs of various colors. The outer shell automatically opens in mid-air, and these small玩意散落out,张开风翅, falling on the ground,专等passers-by and vehicles to碰响them. But the bombs were all thrown into荒沟by the heroes on the transportation line and became useless. Only the outer shells are useful. You can倒立the 风翅, put some books and newspapers on the横格. Some people also use it as a bowl cabinet菜橱and the medicine rack in the clinic. They are also preparing to use the silver iron sheet of gasoline bombs to make a batch of basins,菜盆and large bathtubs for澡塘to prepare for winter.

　　"Compared to a year ago," the host said, "the enemy is不知how many times more毒辣. But what can it do to us? The enemy has 'sea and air superiority' in both hands. This year it疯地bombs during the day and bombs at night. When it fails like this, it changes to that. It is more毒辣each time. From March to August 1951 alone, the enemy fired 800,000 tons of ammunition, equivalent to 15,000 carloads. In order to transport more steel and explosives, the enemy soldiers couldn't even wear winter clothes until November. But it炸到处滥炸, and we通车everywhere. If it能炸断several times, we修复several times. When the enemy throws flares, the driver says '借光借光'; when the enemy throws four-legged nails, the soldiers say '蜡台用不完'; when the enemy throws time bombs, the engineers say '送炸药来了'. The enemy wants to bomb us so that we freeze to death and starve to death, but unexpectedly it炸出的us some 'world firsts': trains can run one after another even without lights; the maximum load of large trucks reaches 10,000 catties; a bare荒沟can冒out several thousand people as soon as it gets dark, all of whom live on warm kangs, eat hot meals, and sleep soundly in the bombing. The more we fight, the stronger we are, until the enemy even stopped throwing four-legged nails,子母bombs, and even flares and time bombs are rarely seen. Even the enemy's air force commander was dismissed. Of course, the enemy is not甘心to fail, and it will use more毒辣tricks. We打地洞,安电灯,修礼堂,挖菜窖, are determined to fight the enemy to the end in the long term. We can not only endure hardships, but also create life. In just two or three months, everyone from people to cars on the transportation line has settled down. Even the air defense 哨along the highway has a small underground warm kang, just like going to work in the office, and there is a place to rest even if you don’t go home. We also want to放电影and开晚会, just like in our motherland, we study when we should study, and we entertain when we should entertain. -- Use子母bombs to make bookshelves, use four-legged nails to点洋蜡, and read ‘毛泽东选集’ on the banks of the Chongchon River,气死the Americans!"

    清川江畔
    新华社记者　华山
    太阳西斜，安州越来越近，汽车简直是在飞着——大宁江和清川江就在前面了。
    从这里上前方，不过桥就得过船，还得横过两条江之间的开阔原野，正是敌机一年来死啃不放的地方。熟悉的俯冲扫射声果然又在这时响了起来。
    山那边，几架“野马式”飞机正在上下翻腾，眼前却是光秃秃的，只有尘土紧跟着汽车滚流着，叫太阳照得金闪闪的，一溜好几里地长。情况相当紧张。汽车越跑得快，尘头越冲得猛，顶头风刮得气都透不过来了，黄尘反而滚上车厢，扑向车头，硬和汽车抢路。看着它那气势汹汹的样子，我心里反而踏实了。这时我记起了另一辆卡车和敌机斗争的故事来。那辆叫敌机追了二十几里的大卡车，就是靠着这股飞尘胜利前进的。起初它在山路上和敌机搏斗着，一时猛开，一时猛停，绕山边，钻树丛，躲开了三次俯冲扫射的子弹，敌机还是不肯撒手，又跟踪追到平川。司机想趁着敌机盘旋瞄准的空隙，一口气穿过平川地，可是路太长，四架野马式已经摆好鱼贯俯冲的架势了。眼看无法脱身，他索性猛开快闸，有多快就跑多快，直到敌机直冲下来的时候，才猛的煞住汽车。没想到尘土依然向前猛跑着，冲出去一两里地。敌机便把尘头当做扫射轰炸的目标，一股劲打的乌烟瘴气。他也在尘土弥漫的林荫下掉转车身，“不告而辞”了。
    现在我们的司机开足马力，显然也是充满信心的。可是敌机并没敢来，江上震响起好一阵猛烈的高射炮声，“野马崽子”便无踪无影了。这时我才发觉，这一带的炸弹坑特别多，原野景物也妙得出奇。
    冬麦的垅行在巨大的炸弹坑上起伏着，这样整齐均匀，就像是炸弹坑自己钻到麦垅底下似的；一大片新的炸弹坑夹着公路，紧贴着公路的几处坑口却是从没见过的半圆形，似乎每颗落在路沟里的炸弹都只爆炸了一半，另一半却叫宽阔笔挺的公路压住了；桥头的陡岸已经被炸成漫坡，对岸的沙滩也被炸成河湾似的，宽大的公路江桥却偏偏架在这里。桥墩有树桩打的，枕木架的，石块和沙袋垒的，架在洋灰残墩上的，水上的公路堰墙也是新草袋补着旧草袋，木桩沙堤补着洋灰石堤，一看就想起浑身战伤的老战士，木板的桥面如此坚固平整，紧衔着的堤堰路面也是这样挺直平坦，简直看不出一点炸弹的痕迹。等到汽车开进山沟，我又到了一个奇妙的洞穴世界。
    这是志愿军供应线上的许多兵站之一。乍看过去，周围只是些树木丛生的小山岗，没人家也没田地。汽车已经开到尽头了，转个弯又现出一段新开的黄土公路，穿进山上的松林，新修的避弹室散卧在沿途附近，进口只有步兵交通壕那末一点，里面却是装着一火车皮物资的地下野战仓库。这里有地下卧室，地下澡堂，地下会议厅，……当我走进一间“战地客房”的时候，直热得大衣棉衣都穿不住了。
    “想不到吧？”主人向我夸耀着说。从溪水旁边往上看：这里松林疏落，栗树枯黄，几处灰色的屋檐伏在半坡上，却是没有房顶也没有门的，烟囱的白烟在石岩下呼呼地冒着。走到跟前，屋檐下的坡头还露出矮矮的一排纸窗，一扇木板门也是朝南开着，只是躲在交通壕的胸墙后面，让土坡遮挡住了。交通壕只比两肩宽些，进门也仅仅不用低头，真想不到里面竟是这末宽敞的：火炕、地板、书桌前一张破汽车垫子改成的沙发，四壁打着一棵紧挨一棵的粗大的松树桩子，天花板也是粗梁架着的原棵树干。房顶灌着洋灰，盖着厚土，就和原来的山坡似的，整座房子便完全埋在土里，只有纸窗露出地面。洋灰打顶的木桩房檐也在外面保护着，不怕敌机扫射轰炸，更不怕风吹雨打、阴暗潮湿。
    “这不是刚出国的时候啦！”主人说。那时候敌机搅的白天不能进村，野地雪窝里又没处落脚，背阴处挖个小坑，铺捆稻草，就像钻鸡窝似的，躺进去就抬不起头，打个盹就冻得腿疼腰酸，晚上还通宵干活，整个冬天那里睡过一个好觉，好容易树木全绿了，野地也能睡了，地洞也好挖了，雨季一来又一塌糊涂。大雨在头上淋，山水在脚下冲，防空洞也漏了，洪水也漫到房檐了，在高处搭起帐篷，也是“外面大下，里面小下；外面不下，里面还滴哒。”那时候天天在泥里水里抢运粮食弹药，往回走时心里只想：那怕能睡上一宿暖炕呢，一口气干他七天七夜也不觉累了。“现在美国只管来炸吧，”主人点起洋蜡，只欣赏起这间房子来，“我们还要装电灯，钉板壁，气死美国人！”
    “这是什么？”我拿起桌上的蜡台，主人更得意了，“这也叫做‘气死美国’！”他拆开蜡台，原来是飞机子弹的三环扣套在四脚钉上做成的。四脚钉是两条交叉焊着的弓形钢管，小手指那末粗细，钉头削尖，互相通气，随便扔到地上，总有三只脚贴地站着，一只朝天，汽车轮子滚过去准会叫它扎透，泄出气来。上次大战美国进攻冲绳岛的时候，就曾经被日本的四脚钉弄得汽车到处抛锚，毫无办法。现在敌人走上日寇的侵略老路，在朝鲜玩起这套把戏来，花样更加多了：天一黄昏，敌机便顺着公路，成千成万的到处扔着四脚钉。然后，估计咱们的汽车已经抛锚，堵满路口，敌机便跑来“挂灯”，在头顶扔下好几十颗照明弹，把一二十里公路照个通明，“放烟花的”便赶来投弹扫射，什么杀伤弹、燃烧弹、子母炸弹都拿出来了。可是它花样再多也斗不过我们。光是公路沿线的防空哨，就三里一处，五里一伙，布满了整个战地的前线后方，敌机一到头顶，战士们就跟着飞机屁股追起来，你追一段，我追一段，敌机到哪里都有防空哨盯着屁股追，一发现四脚钉就往路旁一扫。它扔完了，咱也打扫干净了。汽车照样呼呼地跑着。
    “光是看看我们住的地方，你就知道敌机这一年玩过多少花样了。”主人幽默地说。岩石山洞，这是用定时炸弹里的炸药爆开的；房样大的生丝蚊帐，这是照明弹的降落伞做的；摆在房角的书架，这是子母炸弹的薄薄的外壳做的。它有齐眉那般高，肚子里有三层横格，本来是装满了几十颗各色各样的小炸弹的，外壳在半空自动打开，这些小玩意就散落出来，张开风翅，落在地上，专等过路的行人车马把它们碰响。可是炸弹都叫运输战线上的英雄们扔到荒沟里去，成了废物，只有外壳还有些用处，可以把风翅倒立起来，在横格上放些书籍报纸。也有拿它做碗柜菜橱和医务所的药架的。他们还准备用汽油炸弹的银色铁皮做一批脸盆、菜盆和澡塘的大浴盆，准备过冬。
    “比起一年以前，”主人说，“敌人不知毒辣多少倍了。可是它又能拿我们怎样呢？敌人两手拿着‘海空优势’，这一年它疯的白天炸，晚上炸，这样失败了就换那样，一次比一次毒辣，光是一九五一年三月到八月这五个月中间，敌人就打了八十万吨弹药，等于满满的一万五千车皮。敌人为了运来更多的钢铁炸药，连他们的士兵到十一月还穿不上冬衣。可是它到处滥炸，我们就到处通车，它能炸断几次，我们就修复几次。敌人扔照明弹，司机就说‘借光借光’，敌人扔四脚钉，战士就说‘蜡台用不完’；敌人扔定时炸弹，工兵就说‘送炸药来了’。敌人想把我们炸得冻死饿死，没想到却炸出我们好些个‘世界第一’来：火车不打灯也能一列接着一列开；大卡车载重最高达到一万斤；一条荒沟光秃秃的，天一黑就能冒出好几千人来，都是住暖炕，吃热饭，在轰炸中睡了安稳觉的。我们越战越顽强，直斗得敌人四脚钉也不扔了，子母弹也不扔了，照明弹、定时炸弹也少见了，连敌人的空军司令也被撤职了。当然，敌人是不甘心失败的，它还会使出更毒辣的花样来。我们打地洞，安电灯，修礼堂，挖菜窖，就是下定决心和敌人长期斗到底的。我们不但能忍受艰苦，而且能创造生活。只是两三个月的时间，运输线上从人到车都安下家了。就连公路沿线上的防空哨，每一处也有个小小的地下暖炕，就像到办公厅上班似的，不回家也有个地方休息了。我们还要放电影，开晚会，和在祖国那样的，该学习就学习，该娱乐就娱乐。——用子母弹做书架，用四脚钉点洋蜡，在清川江畔读‘毛泽东选集’，气死美国人！”
