    Jingdezhen Municipal People's Government Should Not Misappropriate "Operating Funds" Arbitrarily
    To the Editor: The Central People's Government once allocated a sum of grain funds to various regions to support and provide relief to unemployed workers. However, the Jingdezhen Municipal People's Government in Jiangxi Province, under the pretext of "work-for-relief," misappropriated more than 73,000 jin of grain intended for unemployed workers to build a grand auditorium. I believe this practice is highly inappropriate. They misinterpreted the spirit of the Central Government's "work-for-relief" initiative and failed to allow these grains to play their due role in actively supporting construction urgently needed by the masses, instead using them to build a grand auditorium that is not currently urgently needed. This situation of unauthorized misappropriation of relief funds should be swiftly corrected, and I hope that the Jingdezhen Municipal People's Government will seriously examine this issue and take appropriate action. At the same time, I suggest that other regions learn from the Jingdezhen's lesson and establish certain systems and methods for the use of various "operating funds" to prevent similar incidents from continuing to occur.

    景德市人民政府不应随意挪用“事业费”
    编辑同志：中央人民政府曾经拨付给各地一部粮款，作为扶持救济失业工人之用。江西省景德市人民政府却藉口“以工代赈”，把救济失业工人粮七万三千余斤挪用修建了大礼堂。我认为这样做法是很不恰当的，他们曲解了中央“以工代赈”的精神，没有使这些粮食起到应有的作用，积极用于群众迫切需要的建设方面，而用来修建目前并不急需的大礼堂。这种擅自挪用救济费的情形应迅速纠正，希望景德市人民政府对这个问题认真检查并作适当处理。同时，我建议其他地区应接受景德市的教训，对于各种“事业费”的使用订出一些制度和办法，以防止类似的事件继续发生。
