Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd - Statistics up to the end of last November show that state-owned enterprises in Northeast China have increased production and practiced economy, creating wealth equivalent to 14,458,360 tons of grain. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, a large number of individuals who innovated in production emerged in various factories and mines. According to statistics from 250 production units in ten provinces and cities including Shenyang, Anshan, Benxi, Fushun, Lushun-Dalian, Jilin, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Liaoxi, and Liaodong, 21,078 advanced producers have emerged. In their respective work positions, they have motivated the broad masses of workers to carry out a "find the knack" movement, creating 32,814 advanced working methods to increase output and improve quality (preliminary statistics).

The emergence of these advanced working methods has brought a new atmosphere to industrial construction in Northeast China. The high-speed cutting method, fast cutting method, and multi-tool multi-edge cutting method recently promoted by the Northeast Machinery Industry Administration factories are one aspect of this new atmosphere. In November of last year, Machine Factory No. 1 reduced costs by 26% compared to October due to the promotion of high-speed cutting and multi-tool multi-edge cutting methods. After the new plant's mechanical processing workshop of Machine Factory No. 6 implemented high-speed cutting and multi-tool multi-edge cutting methods from September, the output in November increased by two times compared to July; costs in October decreased by 24% compared to July. The employees of various mines also tapped the potential strength underground with high enthusiasm and creativity. Since July 1951, the No. 1 Copper Mine of the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Administration learned the compound rock drilling method created by Soviet Stakhanovite workers, and ordinary workers can now independently operate one to three rock drilling machines for mining (in the past, most were operated by two people), with an average increase in production efficiency of 30%. Young worker Shan Yixing was the first to skillfully master this advanced method and created a new record in September of last year with ore production reaching 250% of the quota. Subsequently, Xu Fuxiu, Zhang Jianming, and others created new records reaching 300% of the quota.

Many factories and mines, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, combined it with the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, carrying out mass criticism and self-criticism movements, which began to eliminate the phenomena of disunity among leading cadres, superficial work, and complacent self-satisfaction that existed in the past. For example, a unit of the Fushun Open-Pit Coal Mine, due to the serious bureaucratic style of the leading cadres in the past, could not fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the employees, and the task of increasing production and practicing economy in August of last year failed, and they even lost wealth equivalent to dozens of tons of grain. In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the leading cadres made deep self-criticisms and corrected their bureaucratic style. As a result, the connections between superiors and subordinates became closer than before, and the employees put forward more than 400 rationalization proposals, and the production situation in the entire workshop has improved.

### 东北公营企业到去年十一月底止  增产节约值千四百多万吨粮食

    东北公营企业到去年十一月底止
    增产节约值千四百多万吨粮食
    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】截至去年十一月底为止的统计，东北公营企业已增产节约了价值等于一千四百五十八万零三百六十吨粮食的财富。在增产节约运动中，各厂、矿涌现出大批革新生产的人物。据沈阳、鞍山、本溪、抚顺、旅大、吉林、松江、黑龙江、辽西、辽东十个省、市二百五十个生产单位统计，已涌现先进生产者两万一千零七十八人。他们在自己的工作岗位上，带动广大工人群众，开展“找窍门”运动，创造了提高产量、改进质量的先进工作方法三万二千八百一十四件（初步统计）。
    这些先进工作方法的涌现，给东北工业建设带来了一种新的气象。最近东北机械工业管理局各工厂所推广的高速切削法、快速切削法和多刀多刃切削法，就是这种新气象所表现的一个方面。机器一厂去年十一月份由于推广了高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法，成本比十月份降低了百分之二十六。机器六厂新厂机械加工车间从九月份实行了高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法以后，十一月份产量比七月份提高了两倍；十月份成本比七月份降低百分之二十四。各矿山的职工，也以高度的积极性和创造性，发掘了井下的潜在力量。东北有色金属管理局第一铜矿，自一九五一年七月学习了苏联斯塔哈诺夫工作者所创造的复式凿岩法以后，一般工人都能单独操纵一台到三台凿岩机进行采掘（过去大多是两人操纵一台），生产效率平均提高了百分之三十。青年工人单乙兴首先熟练地掌握了这种先进方法，在去年九月间创造了矿石产量达到定额百分之二百五十的新纪录。随后徐福修、张建明等，又创造了达到定额百分之三百的新纪录。
    很多厂、矿在增产节约运动中，结合着反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，开展了群众性的批评和自我批评运动，使过去领导干部不团结、工作不深入的现象和自以为是的自满情绪等开始消除。如抚顺露天煤矿某单位由于领导干部过去官僚主义作风很严重，职工的积极性不能充分发挥，去年八月份的增产节约任务落了空，还亏损了价值等于数十吨粮食的财富。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动中，领导干部作了深刻检讨，改正了官僚主义的作风以后，上下联系比以前密切，职工就提出了合理化建议四百多条，全车间的生产情况已有了起色。
