    Tianjin Municipal Industrial and Commercial Management Department
    Disregards Inspection of Local Product Specifications and Quality, Creating Opportunities for Unscrupulous Merchants to Seek Exorbitant Profits

    To the Editor: The public and private local product businesses in Handan Town, Hebei Province, conscientiously inspect product specifications and strive to maintain product quality. As a result, the goods of various local product and mountain goods stores are always in short supply. Even customers from the Northeast who used to purchase Sichuan peppercorns in Tianjin now come directly to Handan to purchase them. Recently, some illegal merchants in other regions (Shexian County, Linxian County), in order to seek exorbitant profits, have been mixing large amounts of Sichuan peppercorn seeds into the Sichuan peppercorns. According to our understanding, they mix thirty catties of Sichuan peppercorn seeds into every hundred catties of Sichuan peppercorns (Sichuan peppercorns cost 24,000 yuan per catty, while the seeds cost only over 1,000 yuan per catty). Because they are afraid of specification inspections, they dare not sell them in Handan and transport them directly to Tianjin. However, the Tianjin Municipal Industrial and Commercial Management Department does not thoroughly inspect product specifications and does not rationally control the price differences of various Sichuan peppercorns, resulting in unscrupulous merchants being able to make exorbitant profits. The selling price of Sichuan peppercorns mixed with Sichuan peppercorn seeds in Tianjin is 24,000 yuan per catty, while good Sichuan peppercorns transported from Handan to Tianjin only sell for 24,500 yuan (the cost is already 24,000 yuan). If the cost of transportation, taxes, and other expenses are added, they will lose money. Therefore, the amount of Sichuan peppercorns on the market in Handan Town has suddenly decreased in the past month. Merchants are in low spirits because there is no profit to be made. They say, "Our Handan local products have such good specifications, but merchants from other places still mix seeds and sell them, and the government doesn't care."

    We believe that the Tianjin Municipal Industrial and Commercial Management Department's neglect of inspecting product specifications and rationally controlling Sichuan peppercorn price differences is an important reason why unscrupulous merchants can make exorbitant profits. We suggest that the industrial and commercial management departments in Tianjin and other local product producing and selling areas should jointly study methods with the local product companies and the Federation of Industry and Commerce to unify the control of local product specifications and quality, and establish inspection organizations to conduct regular inspections. Local products that do not meet the specification standards in the producing areas should not be allowed to be transported out and should be reprocessed. Local products that are found to be substandard in the selling areas should not be allowed to be sold and should also be reprocessed.

### 天津市工商管理部门  不重视检查土产品规格质量  造成了奸商图谋暴利的机会

    天津市工商管理部门
    不重视检查土产品规格质量  造成了奸商图谋暴利的机会
    编辑同志：河北省邯郸镇的公、私营土产业，认真检查产品规格，努力保持产品质量，所以各土产山货栈的货物，老是供不应求，甚至过去在天津采买花椒的东北客人，都直接到邯郸来采买。最近其他地区（涉县、林县）有些不法奸商，为了牟取暴利，竟在花椒内掺入大量花椒籽。据我们了解，他们在每百斤花椒内就掺三十斤花椒籽（花椒每斤二万四千元，籽每斤才一千多元）。他们因怕检查规格，不敢到邯郸出卖，都直接运往天津；而天津市工商管理部门并不很好地检验产品规格，也不合理地掌握各种花椒的差价，以致使奸商有暴利可图。掺花椒籽的花椒在天津的出售价格每斤二万四千元，而邯郸的好花椒运到天津，只卖二万四千五百元（成本就有二万四千元），如把运费、税收等项开支加在一起，还要赔钱。因此，最近一个月来，邯郸镇花椒的上市量突然减少，正当商人因无利可图，经营情绪低落，他们说：“咱邯郸土产规格搞得这么好，外地的土产商还是照样掺籽卖，政府也不管。”
    我们认为天津市工商管理部门忽视检查产品规格和合理地掌握花椒差价，是使奸商有暴利可图的重要原因。我们建议，天津和其他土产产销地区的工商管理部门，应和土产公司、工商业联合会共同研究办法，统一掌握土产规格质量，并成立检查组织，经常进行检查。凡在产地不合规格标准的土产品，不准外运，让他重新加工；在销地检查出不合规格标准的土产品，不准出售，也让他重新加工。
