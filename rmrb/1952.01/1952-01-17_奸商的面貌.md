Jilin Province Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Company employee Wang Dejun confessed his embezzlement and exposed the various despicable tricks of unscrupulous merchants to win over cadres at the Jilin Province and Jilin City two-level organs and groups general cadre meeting.

　　At the end of 1950, Wang Dejun worked in the General Affairs Section of the Processing Department of Jilin City Department Store. Once, he went to the private Yuhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory to deliver processed cloth. Xu Hongshan, the director of the factory's business office, led him to the dormitory on the second floor to talk. Xu Hongshan lured him, saying, "Your life is very difficult, right? A little over one hundred points a month is not enough. You can come to the counter to get some." As he spoke, he took out 2 million Northeast currency and gave it to Wang Dejun. At that time, Wang Dejun was afraid of making a mistake and hesitated, but Xu Hongshan said, "Take it, it's okay; Mr. Rong (embezzler Rong Deyuan) from your place has already accepted a share." So Wang Dejun accepted the money. The next time they met, Xu Hongshan threatened Wang Dejun, saying, "This matter between us, only you and I know, you can't tell anyone else. You know, the Communist Party opposes corruption, and if you tell, I'll be sorry to you." From then on, Wang Dejun was surrounded by unscrupulous merchants. In January and February 1951, he accepted bribes from the managers of several factories, including Taifeng Dyeing Factory, Gongxing Dyeing Factory, and Yongji Weaving Factory, totaling 3.4 million Northeast currency. In March 1951, after Wang Dejun was transferred to the Processing Department of Jilin Province Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Company, unscrupulous merchants continued to bribe him, and he continued to work for these unscrupulous merchants, not checking the processed cloth, facilitating the unscrupulous merchants to cut corners and steal state property.

　　Wang Dejun revealed many tricks used by unscrupulous merchants to win over cadres. He said: Whatever cadres like, unscrupulous merchants will provide, and if that doesn't work, they'll try something else; if they don't have a house, they'll find them one, if they lack fuel, they'll deliver coal, if they don't have a wife, they'll find them one, if they like to have fun, they'll accompany them..., using various tricks to lure cadres into their trap. Wang Dejun gave an example: Zhou Wenbo, an inspector of the Processing Department of Jilin City Department Store, was assigned to inspect processed cloth at the private Yuhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory. Xu Hongshan, the director of the business office of Yuhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory, initially tried to win him over with money and materials, but he didn't fall for it. Xu Hongshan knew he wasn't married, so he used women to lure him. He said to him, "Old Zhou, work hard for us, if the company doesn't want you, I'll support you for the rest of your life, not to mention supporting one, ten or eight wouldn't be anything. If you want to marry a wife, you can choose from the sixty or seventy female workers in our dye factory, whoever you fancy, we'll give you that one." He finally trapped Zhou Wenbo with this method. An inspector surnamed Bao liked to play the erhu, so the unscrupulous merchant Shang Decai specially bought him an erhu. When he went to inspect the processed cloth, he only cared about playing the erhu, resulting in negligence in inspection. Unscrupulous merchants also used various methods to compliment and flatter. At the evening party held by the Jilin City Federation of Industry and Commerce during the 1950 National Day, Xu Hongshan, as a receptionist, shouted loudly, "The front row and second row seats are reserved for the leaders," and set out cigarettes and fruits. The so-called "leaders" were the staff of the Processing Department of Jilin Province Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Company. When the director of the Processing Department entered the theater, Xu Hongshan even shouted on stage, "The whole audience stands up and applauds."

　　However, when the unscrupulous merchants no longer needed Wang Dejun and Zhou Wenbo, they kicked them away. After Zhou Wenbo was expelled from Jilin City Department Store, Xu Hongshan not only didn't "support" him, but also ignored him. When Wang Dejun's family moved to Jilin City in April 1951, the manager of the private Yongji Weaving Factory immediately arranged a house for him and was very attentive, but in May, when Wang Dejun was transferred to work elsewhere, the unscrupulous merchant immediately came to urge him to move, his wife was about to give birth, but the unscrupulous merchant wouldn't allow him even a day, and said, "Who cares if you give birth, I don't care if you raise a child on the street, move out immediately!" At this time, Wang Dejun began to recognize the hypocritical and cunning face of the unscrupulous merchants.

　　In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, Wang Dejun improved his awareness through ideological struggle, confessed his embezzlement crimes, reported the embezzlement behavior of others, and exposed the ugly faces of unscrupulous merchants. He said sadly, "I wear the clothes of a revolutionary cadre and am entrusted by the people, but I am 'eating inside and out' and 'serving' unscrupulous merchants, causing losses to state property. I am sorry to the country and sorry to the people. I want to correct my mistakes and work hard for the people in the future to atone for my crimes." (Xinhua News Agency)

    奸商的面貌
    吉林省花纱布公司职员王德俊在吉林省和吉林市两级机关团体全体干部大会上，坦白了自己的贪污行为，并揭露了奸商拉拢干部的各种卑鄙伎俩。
    一九五零年末，王德俊在吉林市百货公司加工科总务股工作。有一次，他到私营裕华染织厂去送加工布。该厂营业室主任许洪山把他领到二楼宿舍去谈话。许洪山诱骗他说：“你的生活很困难吧，一个月才一百来分，不够用可以到柜上来拿。”说着就拿出二百万元东北币送给王德俊。当时王德俊怕犯错误，心里犹豫，许洪山就说：“你收下吧，没事；你们那儿的荣先生（贪污犯荣德远）早就接受了一份。”这样，王德俊便把钱收下了。下一次见面时，许洪山便威胁王德俊说：“咱们的事，就你我知道，你可不能跟别人说。你知道，共产党反对贪污，你如果说出来，我可对不起你。”从此，王德俊便被奸商包围起来。在一九五一年一、二月间，他又接受了泰丰染厂、共兴染厂、永吉织布厂等几个厂的经理的贿赂，共东北币三百四十万元。一九五一年三月，王德俊调到吉林省花纱布公司加工科工作后，继续有奸商向他行贿，他也就接连地替这些奸商办事，对加工布不加检查，便利奸商们偷工减料、盗窃国家财产。
    王德俊揭发出奸商拉拢干部的许多花招。他说：干部喜欢什么，奸商就来什么，这样不行再换那样；没房子的给找房子，缺烧的给送煤，没老婆的给找老婆，好玩的就陪着玩……，用各种诡计引诱干部上他的圈套。王德俊举例说：吉林市百货公司加工科检查员周文波被派在私营裕华染织厂检查加工布。裕华染织厂的营业室主任许洪山起初用金钱、物资拉拢他，他都没有上当。许洪山知道他没有结婚，就用女人引诱他。跟他说：“老周，你给我们好好干吧，如果公司不要你，我养活你一辈子，别说养活你一个，十个八个也不算啥。如果你要娶老婆，咱们染厂六七十个女工随你挑，你相中那个就给你那个。”他用这个方法终于把周文波套住了。有一个姓暴的检查员好拉胡琴，奸商商德财就专门为他买了一把胡琴，他去检查加工布时就光顾拉胡琴，结果疏忽了检查。奸商们还用各种办法来恭维、捧场。一九五零年国庆节吉林市工商联合会举行晚会时，许洪山担任招待员，他大声嚷叫说：“头排，二排座是给首长留的”，并摆上了香烟、水果。所谓“首长”就是吉林省花纱布公司加工科的工作人员。加工科科长进戏院时，许洪山还在台上高呼：“全场起立，鼓掌欢迎。”
    可是，当奸商们用不着王德俊、周文波的时候，就一脚把他们踢开。当周文波被吉林市百货公司开除后，许洪山不但不“养活”他，而且连理也不理他了。王德俊的家眷在一九五一年四月搬到吉林市时，私营永吉织布厂经理连忙给他安排房子，十分殷勤，但到五月王德俊调到别处工作，那个奸商马上就来撵他搬家，他妻子正要生孩子，奸商却一天也不容，还说：“谁管你生孩子，你在马路上养孩子我也管不着，马上给我腾房子！”这时候，王德俊才开始认识奸商们的虚伪刁恶的面貌。
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，王德俊经过思想斗争，提高了觉悟，坦白了自己的贪污罪过，检举了别人的贪污行为，揭露了奸商的丑恶面貌。他沉痛地说：“我穿着革命干部的衣服，受着人民的委托，可是却‘吃里爬外’，为奸商‘服务’，使国家财产遭受损失，我对不起国家，对不起人民。我要痛改前非，今后好好地为人民工作，立功赎罪。”（新华社）
