Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 31st: Comrade Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, issued a New Year's Day letter to the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army. The full text is as follows:

Comrades Commanders, Fighters, Staff, Logistics Personnel, and Political Workers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

You and the Korean People's Army have been fighting the American aggressors and their accomplices until today—New Year's Day, 1952—for fourteen months. In your heroic and arduous anti-aggression war, you have achieved brilliant victories and laid a solid foundation for finally defeating the enemy. Your victory disrupted the American timetable for preparing a world war, greatly encouraged the national liberation movements in colonies and semi-colonies, and strengthened the confidence of the people of the world in the struggle to defend peace. You have made significant contributions to the just cause of defending the security of the motherland and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. I extend my New Year's greetings to all of you comrades and express my deep condolences to the comrades who were gloriously wounded in the anti-aggression war, to those who fell ill due to overwork, and to the families of the martyrs.

In the year and more that we have been fighting to defend our motherland and safeguard peace in the Far East, our great motherland, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, has completed the liberation of the entire mainland and has achieved brilliant achievements in various constructions. In the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the people of the whole country have greatly raised their patriotic and internationalist political consciousness, and have used enormous manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support the Volunteer Army, ensuring the supply of materials and the improvement of equipment for the Volunteer Army, enabling us to rapidly establish air force, artillery, and armored units. The people of the whole country, in order to overthrow the feudal land system, have carried out a large-scale land reform, opening up broad avenues for economic construction. The production of agriculture and industry in the whole country has mostly recovered to the highest level in our history. Prices across the country are basically stable, and commerce and foreign trade are also increasingly prosperous. In the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the lurking bandits, despots, and US-Chiang secret agents have been basically eliminated, and the people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated. Social order has shown unprecedented stability. The cultural and educational undertakings of the whole country have also achieved remarkable results. The progress of the new China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao is astonishing and rapid, and the beautiful prospects of our motherland are already in sight.

In order to defend our beloved motherland, our Volunteer Army came to Korea in the winter before last to directly assist the Korean people in fighting the enemy. The war of aggression launched by US imperialism in June 1950 seriously threatened the security of our motherland and peace in the Far East. US imperialism, while launching the war of aggression against Korea, also occupied our country's Taiwan. Disregarding the condemnation and warnings of the Chinese people and the people of the world, the American aggressors inhumanly slaughtered the Korean people, violated the airspace of Northeast China, and ignited the flames of war to the Yalu River, attempting to achieve the arrogant goal of destroying Korea and further invading the Chinese mainland. It was not until the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fought side by side that this arrogant conspiracy of US imperialism was defeated.

Our People's Volunteer Army's just action of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea for fourteen months has received the warm support of the Chinese and Korean people, and has received the universal sympathy of the great Soviet people, the people of the people's democratic countries, and the peace-loving people of the world. Therefore, we, together with the heroic Korean People's Army, have achieved great victories, driven the US aggressor army and its accomplice forces back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, and caused the enemy's troops and combat equipment to suffer extremely heavy losses and consumption. From October 1950 to December 1951, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies annihilated a total of 490,000 enemy troops, of which 210,000 were American troops. If we add 100,000 non-combat attrition due to desertion, illness, and frostbite, the loss of the American aggressor army's living strength is more than 300,000. The loss of aircraft of the American aggressors is no less than 2,500. And our Chinese and Korean people's armies not only maintain a strong living strength, but also become stronger as they fight. On the Korean battlefield, the People's Air Force gave the American Air Force a strong blow, and the People's Artillery and Armored Forces gave the American aggressor ground forces a blow, which is a significant proof in this regard. Victory is definitely in our hands. If the American aggressors insist on gambling on the war of aggression against Korea, the final result will inevitably be a complete loss. As the war continues, the American people and soldiers are becoming increasingly weary of the war of aggression against Korea. The quarrels and contradictions within the aggressive bloc are also deepening. The war prospects of American imperialism are extremely bleak.

Due to the military fiasco of the American aggressors and the pressure from the people of the world demanding a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, they were forced to accept the holding of armistice negotiations in July 1951. But in the five months of negotiations, they have been using despicable delaying tactics and destructive means. They vainly attempt to achieve their aggressive goals at the conference table that they cannot achieve militarily—interfering in the internal affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in order to maintain their aggressive position, so as to continue launching aggressive wars. We must be vigilant and continue to defeat the enemy's political and military conspiracies.

Chairman Mao pointed out clearly in his opening speech at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The great struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea is still continuing and must continue until the US government is willing to resolve it peacefully." Chairman Mao pointed out that the central task of the Chinese people today is to "increase production, practice strict economy, in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army." Our Volunteer Army is the glorious fighting team standing at the forefront of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and must continue to bravely complete our combat missions, constantly annihilate the enemy who dares to continue to invade, and strive for the final victory of the anti-aggression war. In order to guarantee the complete fulfillment of this glorious mission, we must resolutely do: First, further give play to the initiative of every comrade, step up the improvement of tactical technology, and improve work efficiency. Second, continue to strengthen political education, and continue to improve the discipline and political consciousness of the troops. Third, respond to the call of the motherland, practice strict simplification and economy, eliminate corruption, waste, and bureaucratic work styles, cherish every weapon, every ammunition, and every item given to us by the people of the motherland, and give full play to their role. If we do the above three things well, we will surely be able to further improve the combat effectiveness of our troops and guarantee that we will achieve greater victories in 1952.

    人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军
    号召志愿军继续英勇战斗
    保证取得一九五二年的更大胜利
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十一日电】中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀同志发表一九五二年元旦给志愿军指挥员和战斗员同志们的信，全文如下：
    中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员、参谋人员、后勤人员、政治工作人员同志们：
    你们和朝鲜人民军在一起对美国侵略者和他的帮凶军作战到今天——一九五二年元旦，已经有十四个月了。你们在英勇艰苦的反侵略战争中，已经取得了辉煌的胜利，奠定了最后打败敌人的稳固基础。你们的胜利，打乱了美国准备世界大战的时间表，大大地鼓舞了殖民地和半殖民地的民族解放运动，增强了世界人民对保卫和平的斗争信心。你们在保卫祖国安全、保卫远东和世界和平的正义事业上，已作了重大的贡献。我特向你们全体同志祝贺新年，并向在反侵略战争中光荣负伤、因劳成疾的同志们和烈士的家属们表示深切的慰问。
    在为保卫我们祖国、保卫远东和平而战斗的一年多时间中，我们伟大祖国在毛主席的英明领导下，已经完成了全部大陆的解放，并在各项建设上获得了辉煌的成就。全国人民在抗美援朝运动中大大地提高了爱国主义和国际主义的政治觉悟，以巨大的人力、物力和财力来支援志愿军，保证了志愿军物资的供应和装备的改善，使我们迅速地建立空军、炮兵和装甲部队。全国人民为推翻封建土地制度，进行了规模巨大的土地改革、开辟了经济建设的广阔道路。全国农业和工业的生产大部分已恢复到我国历史上的最高水平。全国物价基本稳定，商业和对外贸易也日益繁荣。在大张旗鼓地镇压反革命的运动中，已经在基本上消灭了潜伏的土匪、恶霸和美蒋特务，进一步巩固了人民民主专政。社会秩序表现了空前未有的安定。全国的文化教育事业也获得了显著的成就。中国共产党和毛主席领导的新中国的进步，是惊人的，迅速的，我们祖国美丽的远景，是已经可以望得到了。
    为了保卫我们可爱的祖国，我们志愿军在前年冬天来到朝鲜，直接援助朝鲜人民对敌作战。美帝国主义在一九五○年六月所发动的侵略战争，严重地威胁到我们祖国的安全和远东的和平。美帝国主义在发动侵朝战争的同时，并霸占了我国的台湾。美国侵略者不顾中国人民和全世界人民的斥责和警告，惨无人道地屠杀朝鲜人民，侵犯中国东北的领空，并将战火燃烧到鸭绿江边，企图达到灭亡朝鲜，进一步侵略中国大陆的狂妄目的。直到中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，才使美帝国主义这种狂妄阴谋遭到失败。
    我们人民志愿军十四个月来抗美援朝的正义行动得到了中朝人民的热烈支援，得到了伟大的苏联人民、人民民主主义国家人民、和全世界爱好和平人民的普遍同情。因此，我们与英雄的朝鲜人民军在一起取得了伟大的胜利，将美国侵略军及其帮凶军逐回到三八线附近，并且使敌军的兵力和战斗器材遭受了极其惨重的损失和消耗。从一九五零年十月到一九五一年十二月的十四个月中，朝中人民军共计歼灭敌军四十九万人，其中美军占二十一万人。如果加上逃亡生病冻伤等非战斗减员以十万人计，则美国侵略军有生力量的损失在三十万人以上。美国侵略者飞机的损失，不少于二千五百架。而我们中朝人民军队，不仅保持着雄厚的有生力量，而且愈战愈强。在朝鲜战场上，人民空军给予美国空军坚强的打击，人民炮兵和装甲部队给予美国侵略者地面部队的打击，就是这方面的显著证明。胜利是确定地掌握在我们手中。美国侵略者如果要坚持侵朝战争的赌博，最后的结果必然是彻底输光。随着战争时间的延长，美国人民和士兵正在对于侵略朝鲜的战争愈来愈加厌倦。侵略集团内部的争吵和矛盾，也在日益加深。美国帝国主义的战争前途是极其暗淡的。
    美国侵略者由于军事上的惨败，由于全世界人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题的压力，在一九五一年七月间被迫接受了举行停战谈判。但他们在五个多月的谈判中，一直在卑劣地使用拖延手段和破坏手段。他们妄图在会议桌上达到他们不能在军事上达到的侵略目的——干涉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的内政，借以保持他们的侵略地位，以便于继续发动侵略战争。我们必须提高警惕，继续击败敌人在政治上和军事上的阴谋。
    毛主席在中国人民政协会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议的开会词中明确指出：“抗美援朝的伟大斗争现在还在继续进行，并且必须继续进行到美国政府愿意和平解决的时候为止。”毛主席指出今天中国人民的中心任务是“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”。我们志愿军是站在抗美援朝最前列的光荣的战斗队，必须继续英勇地来完成我们的战斗任务，不断地歼灭敢于继续侵犯的敌人，争取反侵略战争的最后胜利。为了保证这个光荣任务的彻底完成，我们必须坚决做到：第一，更加发挥每个同志的积极性，加紧提高战术技术，提高工作效率。第二，继续加强政治教育，继续提高部队纪律和政治觉悟。第三，响应祖国的号召，厉行精简节约，消灭贪污浪费和官僚主义作风，爱护祖国人民交给我们的每一件武器、每一颗弹药和每一样物件，充分地发挥它们的作用。我们做好了上面三件事，就一定能够更加提高我们部队的战斗力，保证我们取得一九五二年的更大的胜利。
