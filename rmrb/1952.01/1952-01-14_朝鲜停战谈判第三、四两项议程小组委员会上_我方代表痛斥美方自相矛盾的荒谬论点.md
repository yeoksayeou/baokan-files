Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 13th: On the subcommittee for the third agenda item of the Korean Armistice Negotiations, after the opposing side had, for two consecutive days, insisted on restricting our right to construct or not to construct facilities within our territory under the pretext that our domestic airport facilities would threaten their security, on January 13th, the opposing side boasted about the effectiveness of their indiscriminate bombing and claimed that they should retain the right to interfere with our domestic facilities after the armistice. Our representatives vehemently denounced the opposing side's self-contradictory arguments, pointing out that even during the period of hostilities, although the opposing side carried out indiscriminate bombing, it could not interfere in our internal affairs, could not interfere with our construction or non-construction of any facilities, and could not stop us from resolutely fighting back against the opposing side's brutal acts of indiscriminate bombing. The opposing side itself had to admit that their brutal acts of indiscriminate bombing were encountering increasingly serious blows. Whether or not we carry out any facility construction in North Korea after the armistice is entirely a matter of internal affairs and does not allow the opposing side to interfere in any way.

On the subcommittee for the fourth agenda item, our representatives continued to expose the opposing side's conspiracy to detain our captured personnel and hand them over to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs under the guise of "one-for-one exchange" and "voluntary repatriation," and again demanded that the opposing side submit the difference of 1,456 of our captured personnel, as well as information on the whereabouts of 44,205 of our personnel. The opposing side was unable to defend itself and unable to produce the materials it had long claimed it would hand over, instead attempting to find a basis for its proposal in the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. Our representatives pointed out that although we are not a signatory to the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, the opposing side, which has always used the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War as its shield, is in fact openly violating the explicit provisions of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. Our representatives sternly pointed out: "General Libby said that Article 7 of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War stipulates that if prisoners of war choose repatriation, the two sides shall not enter into agreements to deprive the prisoners of war of their right to repatriation. General Libby, who constantly quotes the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, is openly distorting the provisions of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, which cannot but surprise me. Article 7 of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War states that prisoners of war shall not, under any circumstances, renounce in part or in whole the rights which this Convention grants them. The stipulation of this article is precisely to prevent the deprivation of the inalienable right of repatriation of prisoners of war under the guise of 'voluntary repatriation,' as your proposal attempts to do. Your deliberate distortion can only prove that even your own side cannot defend your absurd proposal."

    朝鲜停战谈判第三、四两项议程小组委员会上
    我方代表痛斥美方自相矛盾的荒谬论点
    【新华社开城十三日电】朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，对方代表在连续两天藉口我方境内机场设备将威胁对方安全，坚持限制我方进行或不进行境内设备修建的权利后，一月十三日对方却又妄自吹嘘其狂轰滥炸的效能，声称在停战后应该保有干涉我方境内设备的权利。我方代表痛斥对方这种自相矛盾的论点，指出即使在敌对行为进行期间，对方虽然施行狂轰滥炸，也不能干涉我方的内政，不能过问我方进行或不进行任何设备，不能制止我方用坚决的斗争痛击对方狂轰滥炸的暴行。对方自己也不得不承认对方狂轰滥炸的暴行正遭遇到日益严重的打击。停战后我方进行或不进行朝鲜境内的任何设备的修建，完全是内政问题，根本不容许对方过问。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表继续揭露对方以“一对一交换”和“自愿遣返”为藉口，企图扣留我方被俘人员送交蒋李匪帮的阴谋，并再次要求对方提交一千四百五十六名我方被俘人员的差额，以及四万四千二百零五名我方人员下落的材料。对方无法自作辩护，又不能交出早已自称即将交出的材料，却企图在日内瓦战俘公约中为其提案寻找根据。我方代表指出我方非日内瓦战俘公约签字国，但历来以日内瓦战俘公约为其护身符的对方，事实上是在公然违反日内瓦战俘公约的明确规定。我方代表严词指出：“李比将军说日内瓦战俘公约第七条所规定的是如果战俘选择遣返，双方不得订立协议，以剥夺战俘遣返之权。口口声声引用日内瓦战俘公约的李比将军，却公然歪曲日内瓦战俘公约的条文，这不能不令我很惊讶。日内瓦战俘公约第七条说，战俘不得在任何情况下声明放弃本公约所赋与的权利的一部分或全部。这一条文的规定正是为了防止像你方提案所企图的在‘自愿遣返’的藉口下，剥夺战俘之遣返的不可剥夺的权利。你这种有意的曲解只能证明即使你方自己也不能为你方的荒谬提案作辩护。”
