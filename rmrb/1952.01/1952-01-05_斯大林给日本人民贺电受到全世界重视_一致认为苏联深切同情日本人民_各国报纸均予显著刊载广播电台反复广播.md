(Xinhua News Agency, 4th) TASS Moscow dispatch: Tokyo dispatch: Japanese radio stations broadcast the message from Stalin replying to the editor-in-chief of Kyodo News, Iwamoto, several times on the 1st.

Tokyo Radio broadcast the content of Stalin's telegram in the morning. On the same day, radio commentator Rinichi Sasaki commented on the telegram. He said: Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Stalin issued an important statement to the Japanese people. This was issued by Stalin in response to a request from Iwamoto, the editor-in-chief of Kyodo News, asking him to write a New Year's greeting.

Sasaki Rinichi said: We interviewed Iwamoto, the editor-in-chief of Kyodo News, who received the telegram; according to him, the company requested New Year's greetings to the Japanese people from the prime ministers of eighteen countries around the world, but only Stalin sent a telegram.

Sasaki Rinichi first saw in the content of this telegram a diplomatic statement aimed at the US policy towards Japan. He said, "At all international conferences and gatherings, Soviet representatives have always believed that the establishment of military bases in European countries by the United States under the North Atlantic Treaty is the direct cause of the current dangers facing Europe and the entire world. It can be said that this proposition is now fully applicable to Japan."

Sasaki Rinichi believes that Stalin's telegram "shows that the Soviet Union has adopted a new policy towards Japan." He said: "We all remember that on the Soviet Revolution Day on November 7 last year, the Soviet delegation in Japan officially invited government officials headed by Prime Minister Yoshida to a banquet. It is said that this was the first invitation since the war. Also in November, two representatives of the Soviet delegation to Japan visited the Diet and discussed trade issues between Japan and the Soviet Union with parliamentarians. In addition, more than a dozen economic leaders headed by Ichiro Ishikawa received invitations to attend the International Economic Conference to be held in Moscow in April as representatives of Japan. Recently, on the occasion of Premier Stalin's birthday, Ikuo Oyama was awarded the Stalin International Peace Prize. Although Ikuo Oyama is not a communist, he was awarded the prize as a fighter for the cause of peace. From all this, it can be concluded that Premier Stalin's telegram today proves the Soviet Union's new policy towards Japan."

Tokyo Radio broadcast a report from the head of the Associated Press Far East branch, Hobbleicht, on diplomatic circles' comments on Stalin's telegram. The report said: One diplomatic representative said: Stalin's telegram is very important. Another diplomatic representative said: Stalin's telegram says that the Soviet people also experienced foreign occupation in the past, and they understand the suffering of the Japanese people living under foreign occupation now, and these words have profound meaning.

The Associated Press report also said that a senior Japanese official said that Stalin's telegram is worthy of special attention because, on the whole, the telegram is full of a spirit of friendship.

Since Japanese newspapers were not published on New Year's Day, Stalin's telegram was not published until the 2nd.

Newspapers in various countries have published the telegram in prominent positions, and radio stations have repeatedly broadcast the full text of the telegram.

    斯大林给日本人民贺电受到全世界重视
    一致认为苏联深切同情日本人民
    各国报纸均予显著刊载广播电台反复广播
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：东京消息：日本电台在一日一连好几次播送关于斯大林电覆共同通讯社总编辑岩本的消息。
    东京电台在早晨广播了斯大林来电的内容。当天，广播评论员佐佐木凛一就这个电报发表评论。他说：苏联部长会议主席斯大林向日本人民发表了重要的声明。这是斯大林为了应共同通讯社总编辑岩本请他写新年贺词的要求而发表的。
    佐佐木凛一说：我们访问了接到这个电报的共同通讯社总编辑岩本；据他说，该社要求了全世界十八个国家的总理给日本人民写新年贺词，而唯有斯大林一个人拍来了电报。
    佐佐木凛一从这电报的内容里首先看出针对美国对日政策的外交声明。他说：“在一切国际会议和集会上，苏联代表一向认为，美国根据北大西洋公约，在欧洲各国建立军事基地，是引起欧洲以至整个世界目前面临的危险的直接原因。可以说，这种主张现在也完全适用于日本了。”
    佐佐木凛一认为，斯大林的电报“表明苏联已对日本采取了新的政策”。他说：“我们都记得，去年十一月七日苏联革命纪念日的时候，苏联驻日本的代表团曾正式邀请以吉田首相为首的政府官员赴宴。据说这种邀请还是战后的第一次。也是在十一月，苏联驻日代表团的两位代表曾访问国会，与议员们讨论日本和苏联间的贸易问题。除此以外，还有以石川一郎为首的十多位经济界领袖，曾接到邀请他们出席将于四月间在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议，作为日本的代表。最近，在斯大林总理的寿辰的时候，大山郁夫还被授予了斯大林国际和平奖金。大山郁夫虽然不是一个共产党员，但他却被作为维护和平事业的战士授予了奖金。从这一切看来，可以得出结论：斯大林总理今天的电报证明了苏联的新的对日政策。”
    东京电台广播了合众社远东分社社长霍布莱契特关于外交界对斯大林的电报的评论的报道，这项报道说：有一位外交界代表说：斯大林的来电是非常重要的。另一位外交界代表说：斯大林来电说，苏联人民过去也经历过外国的占领，他们很了解现在生活在外国占领下的日本人民的苦难，这些话是有着深刻的意义的。
    合众社的报道又说，日本的一位高级人士说，斯大林的电报是值得特别注意的，因为整个说来，这封电报充满了友好的精神。
    由于日本各报在元旦没有出版，所以到二日才刊载了斯大林的电报。
    【新华社四日讯】东欧人民民主国家的人民对斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电极其重视，各国的报纸都在显著地位刊载这一贺电，电台并多次广播贺电的全文。据塔斯社消息：斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电，受到了匈牙利人民的极大的重视。一日晚，布达佩斯电台把这个贺电的全文共广播了三次，二日上午又广播了两次。已经有成千上万的劳动人民听到了这个电报的全文。“独立匈牙利报”和“光明报”二日都在首页用黑体字刊印了斯大林这个贺电的全文。
    保加利亚人民对斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电也特别重视。索非亚和其它保加利亚广播电台在一日数次播送贺电全文。二日，索非亚电台并再度予以播送。保加利亚通讯社在一日发布特别公报，发表这一贺电的全文。二日，“工人事业报”在首页以大标题发表贺电全文。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民和罗马尼亚人民同样都十分重视斯大林的这一贺电。捷克斯洛伐克电台和布加勒斯特电台，在元旦都反覆播送了贺电的全文。在波兰，全国所有的主要报纸二日都在首页刊载了这一贺电。
    此外，柏林民主区的晚报“柏林晚报”和“每夜快报”在二日也在首页刊载了斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电。
    【新华社四日讯】美、英、法、意、丹麦、挪威以及印度和巴基斯坦等国的进步报纸以及资产阶级报纸，普遍刊载斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电或有关的消息。据塔斯社消息：在美国纽约，“纽约先驱论坛报”的晚版刊载了关于斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电的报道。“纽约时报”刊载了关于贺电的新闻的摘要。美联社和合众社的记者从东京发出的报道中，详细地综述了斯大林的这一新年贺电。
    英国共产党机关报“工人日报”，二日在第一页以“斯大林向日本人民发出贺电”为题刊载了关于斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电的报道。该报道强调说：斯大林表示同情日本人民，并希望他们在争取和平和他们祖国的独立的斗争中胜利。此外，“每日电讯晨邮报”的晚刊在一日报道了斯大林新年贺电的消息。该报节录了贺电中的几点，特别提到斯大林表示苏联人民深切同情因外国占领而遭受着苦难的日本人民、并表示希望日本人民获得他们祖国的独立的一节。二日，“泰晤士报”、“每日邮报”、“新闻纪事报”和“每日先驱报”也都刊载了这一消息。“泰晤士报”特别指出斯大林的贺电中关于日本人民争取独立的英勇斗争和苏联人民对于处在外国占领状态下的日本人民的深厚同情的话。
    一日，所有法国的晚报都刊登了关于斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电的报道。“今晚报”在封面上刊登了电文的摘要，标题为：“斯大林祝日本人民获得自由、幸福”。
    罗马各民主报纸均以显著地位刊登斯大林的这一贺电。意大利共产党机关报“团结报”在第一页刊登贺电全文，标题为：“争取和平、民主的胜利”。意大利社会党机关报“前进报”说：“斯大林给日本人民的贺电，在目前美国企图武装日本及把日本并入美国在远东的侵略计划的体系中去的时候，是具有极端重要的意义的。”右翼各报也刊登了斯大林给日本人民的贺电的消息。
    丹麦共产党机关报“国土与人民”也于二日在第一版刊载了斯大林致日本人民的新年贺电。该报同时并登载了斯大林的照片。在挪威首都奥斯陆，各报都摘要刊载了斯大林的这个贺电。瑞士广播电台对这个贺电也曾摘要播送。
    在印度和巴基斯坦，各报都在二日刊载了斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电。
