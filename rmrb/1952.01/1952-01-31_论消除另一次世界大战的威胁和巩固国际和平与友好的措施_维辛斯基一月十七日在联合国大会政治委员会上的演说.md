The debate on "Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Strengthen International Peace and Friendship" has shown that some delegations are acting according to a carefully crafted strategy aimed at obstructing a serious and thorough discussion of the proposals made by the Soviet delegation. The nature and tone of the speeches by these representatives, the arguments they presented, the criticisms they made, and the roles they played all indicate that they had colluded beforehand. This collusion was aimed at avoiding a discussion of the substance of the proposals made by the Soviet delegation on January 12, 1952.

The following facts prove the existence of such a conspiracy: the delegations of the Atlantic Pact countries posed a series of identical questions to us—questions supposedly vague, suspicious, and in need of clarification! The representatives of the United States, Britain, Canada, Bolivia, and other countries, as if under orders, asked the same questions. This is certainly not coincidental. For example, they all asked: What does "implementation" mean? How should "simultaneously" be understood? What kind of international control body is it? Will it perform its duties indefinitely, and so on.

They posed these questions merely as a means to evade discussing the substance of the Soviet proposals and to argue that these proposals should be studied by the so-called Disarmament Commission, advocating that these proposals be transferred to that commission.

The situation is such that this can also be seen from the fact that after posing a series of questions, these representatives, as if with one voice, said: It is impossible to discuss these questions here, in the Political Committee, and it is actually unnecessary to discuss them here, because the Disarmament Commission has already been established. The representatives of the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Bolivia, Brazil, and other countries openly said this, suggesting that the entire issue be transferred to the Disarmament Commission for discussion.

This shows that some representatives are not discussing the substance of the Soviet proposals but are indulging in empty talk unrelated to the agenda, revealing their lack of interest in formulating measures to eliminate the threat of another war and strengthen international peace and friendship. Since it is undeniable that there was collusion, it also explains why certain representatives, in their speeches, made disgusting and vulgar attacks on the Soviet Union, obviously aiming to muddy the waters—everyone knows that fishing in muddy waters is easier—and to make it easier to evade the discussion of fundamental and important issues, and to use the means of distorting and even falsifying facts to deceive public opinion.

In this regard, several representatives have broken all records, stooping to fabricate the most absurd things and spreading the most shameful lies and slander. The representative of Haiti even delivered a long speech about "Slavic expansionism," slandering and defaming us and attempting to slander Soviet foreign policy. In discussing the military adventure launched by Finnish fascists against the Soviet Union in 1939, he spoke many slanderous words about the Soviet Union, daring to defend the shameful position taken by the League of Nations on this issue here, and even proudly recounted his own work in that international—let's call it that—organization.

Of course, as a representative of a former member state of the League of Nations, he clearly knew that this adventure was launched by Finnish fascists supported by a powerful master, whose master on one side was Hitler's Germany, and on the other side was the League of Nations, including Hitler's friends—led by Chamberlain and Daladier. He also knew that at that time, the Finnish ruling class had already formed an alliance with the Hitlerites and allowed them to use Finnish territory as a springboard for attacking the Soviet Union. Yet he shamelessly distorted facts and slandered, attempting to divert the attention of the Political Committee from discussing the current important issues.

Obviously, he had the same purpose in mind when he took out a pile of slanderous words from the archives of the U.S. State Department to repeat them: this is the compilation published by the State Department at the end of January 1948 under the mysterious title "Relations between the Nazis and the Soviet Union from 1939 to 1941." It has long been irrefutably proven that the American historians who published this compilation attempted to slander the Soviet Union and reduce the international influence of the Soviet Union as a true, steadfast, and unyielding democratic fighter and a firm and unwavering fighter for peace by fabricating so-called documents obtained from Hitler's Foreign Ministry.

The attempt by the State Department was exposed at that time. The slanderers were caught red-handed and put in chains.

However, it seems that the glory gained by these gentlemen was not enough to satisfy certain representatives, who are now trying to use American forgeries again, hoping that this can help to undermine the trust of millions of people in the Soviet Union, who rightly consider the Soviet Union to be a steadfast and unyielding fighter against the threat of a new war, a fighter for peace.

Here, the representative of Haiti repeated the slanderous rumors spread by American historians in 1948 about the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. Of course, he would not be unaware of the truth of the matter. He certainly knew that at that time, just before the outbreak of World War II, the Anglo-French bloc, backed by the United States, was particularly active in isolating the Soviet Union, encouraging Hitler's Germany to turn eastward, encouraging it to attack Poland, which had received the "guarantees" of the Anglo-French bloc, and the Soviet Union. He certainly knew that since the Anglo-French countries, with the support of the United States, adopted such a policy, the Soviet Union had no other choice but to accept the proposal to conclude this treaty, because this was the best possible way out of all possible ways out. This choice was a wise and far-sighted step taken by Soviet foreign policy under these circumstances. The step taken by the Soviet government, to a large extent, predetermined the final victory of the Soviet Union and all freedom-loving peoples in World War II. The outcome of this war was the defeat of Hitler's Germany, and the decisive role in defeating Hitler's Germany was played by the Soviet Union and its glorious army.

It is not superfluous to mention here that as early as 1934, Poland, as a major European country allied with Britain and France, concluded a non-aggression pact with Germany. In 1938, Britain and France, as major European countries, also concluded a non-aggression pact with the Hitler gang and issued an Anglo-German, Franco-German non-aggression declaration.

It is clear that the rumors about the 1939 Soviet-German pact spread by the representative of Haiti are intended to use every means (including slander) to try to cover up the policy of his masters, because this policy has aroused the indignation and protests of all peace-loving peoples and all progressive humanity.

I spent some time discussing the speech of the representative of Haiti, not because the speech itself is noteworthy, but only to clarify the shameful role played by the representative of Haiti and his accomplices. Their purpose is to serve their powerful and influential masters, who themselves do not respect facts but like to talk nonsense and slander. Other representatives of this camp are also not averse to distorting facts to slander and defame.

It has been proven that the so-called "defense" of the Atlantic Pact countries is a cover for their aggressive purposes.

The representative of Peru here presented a strange—let's not use any heavier words—"theory." Despite the representative's very complicated explanations, the points of this "theory" are quite clear.

His speech can be summarized as follows: from the nature of things, the Soviet Union is bound to "expand"—expand its territory and increase its influence over other countries; while the fate of the United States is to "defend itself"—take certain measures to overcome the "overwhelmingly great power," to "defend itself"—using the words of the representative of Peru—against this power. From this, it can be directly concluded that the Atlantic Pact is a completely necessary self-defense action in accordance with the provisions of the Charter. As for the Charter, according to the words of the representative of Peru, it expresses justice that is even older than the history of the Charter.

The representative of Peru obviously felt that such a speech would not achieve the desired effect, so he sought help from the authority of the British Foreign Secretary, mentioning his recent speech at Columbia University. He said that this speech most appropriately demonstrated the so-called peaceful policy of the Atlantic Pact, "most clearly and faithfully gave an estimate of the principles, purposes, and tasks of the Atlantic Pact." However, if one carefully reads Mr. Eden's speech, it is not difficult to see that Mr. Eden's speech on the Atlantic Pact and the Atlantic Pact is nothing more than a restatement or elaboration of the American so-called "powerful situation" theory.

Regarding the Atlantic Pact, Mr. Eden said in his speech at Columbia University that if necessary for "Atlantic defense," the British government's troops stationed in various places would continue to remain in place.

We have long known that the Atlantic Pact uses various "defense" talk to cover its aggressive purposes. If, as Mr. Behrendt said, Mr. Eden's speech can be seen as the most appropriate expression of the policy of the three major countries, then this excerpt from the speech is probably the best evidence of the aggressive nature of the Atlantic Pact.

The representative of the United States said that the goal of the Atlantic Pact is precisely to prevent a third world war. However, we see that the activities of the several leading countries in the Atlantic Pact— the United States, Britain, and France—are precisely to launch a war in the Far East and to create the danger and threat of another world war.

In the face of such facts, to try to portray the aggressive Atlantic Pact as an organization aimed at consolidating peace is an utterly irresponsible and frivolous act. Nevertheless, some representatives not only advocate such a theory but also cite Articles 51 and 52 of the United Nations Charter, attempting to prove that the Atlantic Pact is in accordance with the Charter and that membership in the Atlantic Pact and the status of a United Nations member state are not contradictory.

But is this really the case?

Not at all. This is very easy to understand if one carefully studies Articles 51, 52, and 53 of the Charter. The last article can even more powerfully refute the claim that the Atlantic Pact is in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

Article 51 states that member states of the United Nations Organization, if attacked by armed forces, have the natural right to individual or collective self-defense. Everyone knows that no country has attacked any member of the Atlantic Pact, and there is no sign of such an attack. There is no need to repeat the old talk that the Soviet side will launch such an attack, because such rumors have long been refuted and exposed.

I have mentioned Norway's case before. It once expressed fear of any unfavorable behavior from the Soviet side. However, when the Soviet government proposed to the Norwegian government to sign a non-aggression pact, the Norwegian government rejected the proposal and immediately joined the Atlantic Pact.

Does this not make the meaning clear? The Norwegian government and the governments behind it obviously feared that after signing a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, Norway might not be able to fulfill the tasks assigned to it, which were to be assigned to it as soon as it joined the Atlantic Pact. In this way, not only the Norwegian government but also those who control the Norwegian government admit that if Norway concludes a non-aggression pact with any country, it is incompatible with its membership in the Atlantic Pact. This means that a non-aggression pact is incompatible with the Atlantic Pact and the Atlantic Pact.

Someone here mentioned Article 52 on regional arrangements. However, if one studies the so-called boundaries of the North Atlantic region, one can believe that the claim that this pact has only regional character is false.

The North Atlantic Pact is not a regional organization because it is not limited to the Atlantic region but far exceeds the scope of this region. The so-called North Atlantic Pact region includes West Germany, the Black Sea, the Philippines, the Pacific, reaching the Middle East, and the Near East.

Therefore, mentioning Articles 51 and 52 of the Charter is completely useless. Mentioning these articles can only confirm and indeed confirms that the Atlantic Pact violates Articles 51 and 52 of the Charter, violates the principles, purposes, and tasks of the Charter.

Article 53 stipulates: Without the authorization of the Security Council, no enforcement action may be taken under regional arrangements; but measures taken under Article 107—i.e., measures taken by a government against any signatory state of the United Nations Charter in the Second World War—are not subject to this limitation.

Please point out in the Atlantic Pact a clause or a sentence, even a single word, that conforms to this important principle clearly and explicitly stipulated in Article 53. You cannot do this because the Atlantic Pact does not even mention this important principle clearly and explicitly stipulated in Article 53.

Article 5 of the Atlantic Pact completely ignores Article 53 of the Charter and blatantly violates it. Needless to say, everyone knows that the Atlantic Pact has not been granted any power by the Security Council to take any enforcement action, although the leaders of this pact are now vigorously preparing to take such action against countries that are not members of this pact.

Do these facts not completely refute the nonsense that the Atlantic Pact is in accordance with the Charter and within the scope of the United Nations Charter?

This is precisely the case. Because it is completely impossible to find any basis for the Atlantic Pact and the activities of the Atlantic Pact in the Charter, this is the case from a legal point of view. However, the problem is not at all in the legal aspect, the problem is not that the initiators of the Atlantic Pact copied these benevolent words and phrases from the Charter to cover up the aggressive activities of the Atlantic Pact.

They want to make us believe that the Atlantic Pact is almost a charitable organization established for the benefit of mankind. However, from the January 1952 issue of the "United Nations World" magazine, we can see such remarks. The magazine's correspondent in the United Nations, Bill, wrote: The United States established the North Atlantic Alliance (temporarily replacing the United Nations) not to generously help small countries, but to fully strengthen them, thereby increasing American power, utilizing their manpower, their resources, and their military bases.

This completely exposes the myth of so-called American aid, so-called assistance to other small countries!

Another thing worth noting is that the October 4, 1951, issue of the "Chicago Tribune" published an editorial saying that it is now time to remember General MacArthur's words—if one thinks that the United States is in danger of being conquered by the Soviet Union or the combined forces of several countries, that is completely groundless. The Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Fechteler, also holds the same view.... The "Chicago Tribune" pointed out that this means that the United States does not need so many defense appropriations, and perhaps even the draft system is not needed, the United States can feel very safe. The "Chicago Tribune" pointed out that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not to guarantee the security of the United States. However, Messrs. Gross, Lloyd, and their friends want to make us believe that the sole purpose of the establishment of the "Atlantic Organization," this aggressive bloc, is to guarantee the security of the United States!

Do these many facts not make the enthusiasm of those who praise the Atlantic Pact cool down a bit? They use every means to hide the aggressive nature of this pact from public opinion, to cover up the ugly face of this monster with such grand words as defense, peace, and cooperation, and to deceive the people.

Numerous facts show that the activities of the Atlantic Pact are aggressive and have nothing to do with the security goals of the United States. This has been shown by the entire policy of the countries of the Atlantic Pact, a policy that determines all their activities known to the world.

The United States' mad policy of seizing world hegemony must be held responsible for the creation of international tension.

But if the "Atlantic Organization" is not for the purpose of maintaining "security," then what is it for? In this case, why does the United States spend such a huge sum of money to execute war plans related to the activities of the Atlantic Pact, to impose such a heavy burden on American taxpayers? For example, from Truman's January message to the U.S. Congress, it can be seen that such plans are burdensome. Truman admitted in the message that due to the sharp increase in security plan expenditures, if taxes are not increased, it is expected that the budget deficit for the 1953 fiscal year will be very large, almost equal to twice the deficit of the 1952 fiscal year. However, Truman said that even if taxes are increased, the deficit will still be very large, and this situation will continue until the security plan reaches its peak and begins to tighten, which, according to Truman's hope, will last for two or three years.

This is the situation in 1953. What about the situation in 1952? Mr. Truman said that in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1952, the budget deficit may reach around $800 million. According to his estimate, if prompt and effective measures are not taken to increase new taxes, then in the following year, the budget deficit for the 1953 fiscal year will double.

Thus, the budget deficit of the United States will reach $2.4 billion in two years.

What is this huge deficit caused by? Truman said: war plans. What does this deficit mean to the people? New burdens. Truman mentioned new, heavy tax burdens in his message to Congress.

I think it is necessary to mention all this here to explain the source of the economic difficulties caused by the activities of the Atlantic Pact in the countries of this pact and to explain who should be held responsible for the increasing suffering of the people of these countries. Moreover, to expose the lie of pushing the responsibility for the current situation onto the Soviet Union, it is also necessary to mention all this. The responsibility for the current situation must be borne by the Atlantic Pact and the United States, which leads this pact.

Thus, the North Atlantic Pact organization is not needed to maintain American security. As long as it exists, it must stockpile weapons, it must take action, it must expand war plans, and it must maintain war hysteria in society—it must do this. And it is doing this.

Someone here says to us: "Put away your dialectics!" But our "dialectics" is correct dialectics. Even your authorities, who are completely different from our "dialectics" in their way of thinking, have confirmed this. Take, for example, the famous speech of Congressman Armstrong published in the Congressional Record of October 10, 1951. Armstrong said that without taking other measures, only armaments will lead to the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen bombs in war.... He said that throughout history, the arms race has never brought peace, never guaranteed the victory of peace, or promoted the interests of peace. These words are from the mouth of the famous Armstrong, and no one can doubt that he will have a communist way of life or a communist way of thinking, although your House Un-American Activities Committee can suspect anyone of anything.

For example, we recently heard a piece of news that made us very surprised. This news is that thirty-eight U.S. senators requested the U.S. government to recall Mr. Jessup from here because he had shown "un-American thinking." However, everyone who knows Jessup's actions here knows that his way of thinking is the most genuine American way of thinking. You see, what a situation it has come to!

Armstrong also said that it should be admitted that this undeniable fact: the purpose of manufacturing weapons is to use them in military operations.

In an article published on November 29, 1951, the publisher of the "Detroit News," Cowles, said that he could not agree with the view of the crazy Americans; these Americans believe that the United States should now resort to war to exterminate communism. He said that he did not believe that communism could be destroyed by force. He believed that the sooner Americans realize that they cannot use the threat of American military force or the method of buying with dollars to transform the world according to the American model, the sooner they will formulate a sound foreign policy. Is the Atlantic Pact not trying to exterminate communism by war? Is this not its purpose? Is this not what determined the establishment of the European bloc and the establishment of the European Army, which includes the West German army led by Hitler's revengeful generals? It is precisely so. The speeches of the aforementioned famous American political and social leaders prove this. These people are ten thousand miles away from the malicious—according to the views of the U.S. State Department and "Voice of America"—"dialectics."

Those who support the Atlantic Pact want us to abandon the view that the Atlantic Pact is an aggressive bloc; they want us to agree that the Atlantic Pact and our organization (referring to the United Nations) are not contradictory, that its activities are in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, because the United Nations Charter says that it is necessary to stop any attempt by certain countries to revive militarism, to stop the attempt to ignite the fire of war, and to strive for peace, to solve all political, economic, social, cultural, and other problems to consolidate international friendly relations.

Obviously, those who support the Atlantic Pact have not seen what is happening around them, have not seen what all sensible people point out; they have not seen that the United States has plunged into a mad policy of seizing world hegemony; they do not know that the United States must be held responsible for the international situation that has already formed. The foreign policy of the United States has caused social panic and tension, and this panic and tension cannot continue indefinitely, because when you draw a bow, you should know that either the arrow will fly out or the bowstring will break.

Do all these facts not make one believe that the policy of the United States and the Atlantic Pact, including the other member countries of the Atlantic Pact, is a policy of war, not a policy of peace? Is it not the policy of war that the United States and the Atlantic Pact are already pursuing in various parts of the world?

Many facts prove that it is the United States that has invaded Korea. The U.S. representative has not yet dared to refute these facts.

We have raised the issue of immediately stopping hostilities in Korea here. Someone here wanted to portray the Korean War as a "defensive action" by the United Nations against the "aggression" of North Korea. The U.S. representative, in his speech, repeated the stale rumors about the nature and causes of the Korean War that have been refuted dozens of times, and once again, as before, said that the war began because of the North Korean attack. If some of the gentlemen here were not so arrogant in trying to evade this issue and were not completely for the sake of reversing right and wrong to propose various metaphysical, sophistical arguments to explain their motives, I would not have talked about this issue now.

The U.S. representative mentioned the report of the Korean Commission, but he did not explain what kind of commission this is. I am not talking about individuals, nor about the general personal qualities of each of these individuals. Everyone knows that this commission has a definite political task; everyone also knows that this political task determines the entire actions of this commission. The establishment of this commission was to execute a definite political plan, which, in the final analysis, is: under the cover of collecting real information, to provide materials to justify the aggression launched by the puppet regime of Lee Syngman with the support of the U.S. government.

The U.S. representative said that according to the report of this commission, the war began because of the North Korean attack. However, this claim of the commission has been refuted in the past year and the year before. I say that this claim has been refuted because at that time we provided all the evidence, and the representatives of the United States and Britain did not respond. Therefore, I cannot ignore their nonsense now, cannot ignore their attempt to reverse right and wrong; they attempt to make it seem as if it was not them who began this murderous adventure under the flag of the United Nations, as if they were fulfilling the responsibilities of United Nations member states. They attempt to explain that the "aggressors" are not them, but the Korean people. However, in fact, it is not the North Korean army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who invaded the United States, but on the contrary, it is the U.S. army that invaded Korea.

Many facts prove that the United States launched an aggressive war against the Korean people and is still waging this war. The following facts are worth mentioning. These facts are (I will mention only a part of them):

On June 19, 1950, Lee Syngman said in the so-called National Assembly in Seoul in front of Dulles: "If we cannot defend democracy in the cold war, we must win in the hot war." This is a threat of war, a threat to attack North Korea, is it not clear?

In May 1950, the head of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's Korean branch, Johnson, said in the U.S. House Appropriations Committee: A hundred thousand South Korean troops equipped with American weapons and trained by American military instructors are ready to launch a war. Not self-defense, but to launch a war! During this period, Lee Syngman also repeatedly said: May and June 1950 will be the most dangerous period in Korean history.

Dulles wrote a letter to Lee Syngman five days before the North Korean attack in June 1950, saying that he attaches great importance to the role that Lee Syngman's country may play in the great drama that is about to be performed.

It must be noted that this letter was written five days before the South Korean army attacked the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Former South Korean Interior Minister Kim Hyo-sik admitted that in January 1950, General Roberts, when instructing Lee Syngman's officials, said that the plan to attack North Korea had already been decided.... Kim Hyo-sik also said: "Although we have decided to attack, we must create a pretext to make it seem reasonable. Therefore, the most important thing is the report of the United Nations Commission. Of course, the United Nations Commission will submit a report that is biased towards the United States, but at the same time, we must also pay attention to this matter, we must win the sympathy of the United Nations Commission."

There is an absolutely irrefutable document that exposes who is the real aggressor in this war against the Korean people. This document is the map of the headquarters of Lee Syngman's army, which accurately marks the positions of Lee Syngman's troops and the lines of attack on North Korea—once the headquarters issues the order at the appropriate time, the troops will advance according to these arrows. These facts and documents all irrefutably prove that the preparation and execution of the attack on North Korea were precisely by the United States. However, the gentlemen of the U.S. and British delegations remain silent about these facts and documents. This is completely understandable. Facts are ruthless! These facts make the American interventionists and their friends unable to remain silent.

However, such facts are increasing. Here is another new fact that once again proves that it was indeed the United States that launched the attack on North Korea.

The December 1951 issue of the "Internationalist" magazine published a long article by Major General Willoughby, former head of the intelligence bureau of MacArthur's headquarters. The author admitted that one week before the outbreak of the war, all the South Korean troops were ready and had taken up positions along the 38th parallel.

Up to this day, the U.S. representative has not refuted these facts and all these official documents.

The U.S. aggressors repeatedly make absurd demands to delay the Korean talks and continue the aggression.

Now the question is how to stop the Korean War and help the Panmunjom talks to end successfully. We have seen how the U.S.-British bloc has opposed and is still opposing our proposal.

If we carefully listen to the speeches made by the representatives of the United States, Britain, the Philippines, and other countries here about the Korean War, we can easily see that they do not care at all about how to help the Panmunjom talks to end successfully, and therefore they refuse to provide any help for this matter. Not only that, they also want to deceive public opinion: like the U.S. representative who said yesterday that the Panmunjom talks have only a few issues left unresolved and believe that these issues can be quickly resolved. However, this statement is not in accordance with the facts. For example, the words of General Van Fleet, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, are enough to completely refute this statement. According to the Associated Press on January 13, Van Fleet said that the Korean ceasefire talks are very disappointing. What does this mean? Here in Paris, the U.S. representative talked about the Korean talks and said that everything is fine, there are only a few unresolved issues left, and they will be resolved soon; but General Van Fleet, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, said that the situation of the talks is very disappointing. The latter statement is obviously closer to the true situation because the U.S. headquarters is now making various absurd demands to the other side, and this situation does not make one think that there is hope for the success of this talk.

The U.S. representative here said that the U.S. military headquarters in Korea will do its best to achieve a ceasefire, but at the same time, he made some reservations, making one not feel that there is a prospect of success in the talks. In concluding his speech, he said that they are eager for talks, eager for talks in the United Nations. But he also said: When military leaders are trying to reach a ceasefire agreement, it is not possible to have full responsibility to discuss these issues.

However, this is completely hypocritical, because the U.S. military leaders do not want to reach an agreement in Panmunjom. On the contrary, they are very satisfied with the development of the situation in Korea because the war is still going on there, continuing to bring disaster to the Korean people. According to the Associated Press, the same General Van Fleet said that he was satisfied that North Korea was severely damaged, to the extent that the Communists lacked food, clothing, and shelter, and that the North Korean people were in a very serious state.

Does this statement agree with the statement of the U.S. representative who attended the United Nations about their so-called hope to stop military operations? No, it does not agree at all, absolutely not.

General Van Fleet's remarks are the remarks of a professional soldier, who is only satisfied with cutting, stabbing, slashing, and killing women, children, the elderly, soldiers, civilians, farmers, workers, office workers, priests, doctors, in short, anyone. He sees rivers of blood and is very happy. He says: "I am satisfied..." This is the talk of cannibals. This is the psychology of cannibals. Someone says to us: The United Nations absolutely should not interfere in this matter, because it will hinder the efforts of the U.S. "military leaders"; it is said that they are trying to reach an agreement on a ceasefire in Korea. Are you talking about Van Fleet and Ridgway making such efforts? The original mission of those who have the mission to "reach an agreement" on the Korean ceasefire issue and to complete this talk smoothly is them! Only hypocrites will say this, only those who want to cover up their shameful activities will say this. Their shameful activities have already caused the United Nations to lose its prestige. They have shamelessly defiled the name of the United Nations!

Unfortunately, there are already many pages in the United Nations records that are written with such things. Now a new page has been added. This is that they are preparing to reject our second proposal, which calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, an immediate conclusion of a ceasefire agreement, the withdrawal of troops from the 38th parallel, and the withdrawal of all foreign troops and foreign volunteers from Korea. However, all these have been rejected and vetoed. They use those hypocritical, zealous, and flowery words to cover up their actions. But now, the true face of the figures who decide the war and peace in Korea, who decide the ceasefire in Korea, has been exposed by Van Fleet and his supporters. They are now standing in blood up to their knees. These supporters are the War Department, the State Department, and the U.S. government in Washington, and General Van Fleet is speaking and acting with their consent.

We must consider all this and then come to measure whether the following statement is correct or not: We say that the Atlantic Pact is an aggressive bloc, a nest of dark forces of aggression, and therefore membership in this bloc is incompatible with the status of a United Nations member state.

Someone says to us: The ceasefire in Korea completely depends on the Soviet Union. As long as the Soviet Union moves a finger, the war can end.

This is a lie. This is vile incitement propaganda. We know that it is the United States that is delaying the talks! To find out who is delaying the talks, it is enough to recall that the United States proposed the condition of exchanging prisoners one for one. We are willing to remind you: The U.S. command attempted to retain 165,000 out of a total of 176,000 prisoners after the exchange of prisoners. This is a violation of international law, which stipulates the repatriation of all prisoners, not leaving a single person.

Can one agree to exchange prisoners according to the method proposed by the U.S. command? Even if this demand is made by a great power like the United States, or by the entire Atlantic Pact, which is trying to strangle Korea, can a small country like Korea agree to such a demand? Of course, it is impossible to agree to such a demand.

The demand to exchange prisoners according to the "one-for-one" method seriously violates the universally recognized principles of international law. Did the U.S. government not sign the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War in 1932? Does this convention not include Article 75, which stipulates that the governments of the belligerent parties, after signing a ceasefire agreement, must release prisoners of war and send them home?

Does the 1929 Convention provide the possibility for U.S. generals to propose their current "one-for-one" demand in the Korean talks? Did the United States not sign the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War on August 12, 1949? This convention stipulates that as soon as military operations cease, except for prisoners of war who have committed criminal offenses, all others must be immediately released and sent home. Does this convention not stipulate that the governments of the belligerent countries must even search for and ensure the repatriation of captured and scattered members of the opposing forces? Does the U.S. government not know that it has signed this convention? Has it forgotten this convention? The U.S. government knows, but it does not want to implement it, because if an international agreement is not in its favor, in general, it does not hesitate to tear up all international agreements. Someone, with a feigned indignation, says to us: "You must implement international agreements." But they themselves do not implement an important international agreement, especially they do not implement the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, which they signed in Geneva, nor do they implement the 1949 Convention.

Then, who decides the cessation of hostilities in Korea now?

This issue is decided by those who propose absurd, illegal, and unjust demands, such as the "one-for-one" exchange of prisoners and the like! Such demands violate international law and the principles of international law, and violate agreements based on international law and these principles.

The peoples of various countries are resolutely demanding the cessation of the arms race and are making the U.S. war bloc feel panicked.

The U.S. government intends to shift its own guilt to others and to cover up its conspiracy to delay the Panmunjom talks in this way. However, since this deception cannot deceive anyone and cannot convince anyone, the purpose of this conspiracy is to deal with the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of the American people with the war that is now being waged in Korea, and the purpose of this conspiracy is to ease American public opinion—dissatisfaction with this war gambling is rising in the United States. This rise is natural because, except for a small minority and those who live on the leftovers of their mouths, there are now few supporters of this war in the United States. Reports from some U.S. newspapers also prove that dissatisfaction with this war is spreading among the American people. According to a well-informed newspaper like the "Wall Street Journal," some members of Congress returning from their respective constituencies to Washington have all talked about the widespread dissatisfaction with this war among American voters.

The "Wall Street Journal" said: The absolute majority of voters are obviously concerned about U.S. foreign policy and do not understand the trend of this policy.

The "Wall Street Journal" also said that even some representatives of the southern states of Congress, who originally supported the Korean War, now admit that the people of their constituencies—according to the "Wall Street Journal"—demand that Americans withdraw from Korea immediately.

Of course, at the same time, there are opposite sentiments that have been incited by war propaganda, war hysteria, and similar measures, rising in some people. However, the facts mentioned above themselves explain everything, and these facts are also worth considering; I say worth considering, this first applies to the representatives of the Atlantic Pact countries, especially the leaders of this pact in the United States.

The French representative knows his own incompetence, knows that the various schemes to make people believe in the peaceful nature of the Atlantic Pact to cover up the arms race of the Atlantic Pact countries have lost their effect, so he wants to divert people's attention to other issues.

For example, he said that we accuse the Atlantic Pact, we say that membership in the Atlantic Pact is incompatible with the status of a United Nations member state, because the Soviet Union wants to "paralyze" such agreements as the Atlantic Pact.

However, we do not need to do anything to paralyze this pact. The Atlantic Pact and the Atlantic Pact, without our help, are approaching paralysis day by day, because the Atlantic Pact has internal contradictions. These contradictions are becoming clearer and clearer every day. We have seen this situation in Rome, in Paris, and recently, in Washington, in the fruitless talks between Truman and Churchill. In this Atlantic camp, there is no real harmony, and there cannot be real harmony, because in this camp, everything is built on ruthless competition, mutual control of ambition, everything is built on the policy of the strong issuing orders, binding the weak, and making the weak economically and financially dependent.

The peoples of various countries resolutely demand the cessation of the arms race and are making the U.S. war bloc feel panicked.

Title: The Western Powers' Attempts to Obstruct the Soviet Proposal on the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 19th

Of course, no amount of "cooperation," "society," and other empty talk and flowery rhetoric can conceal these contradictions, let alone stop the development of these contradictions. All this deceitful talk serves only one purpose: to avoid discussing the fundamental issues that concern us and to drown out the discussion of these issues with empty talk.

Therefore, it is not surprising that even newspapers that have no intention of supporting or endorsing the Soviet proposal are forced to say that the West wants to prevent the Soviet proposal from being brought up for open discussion. As the January 15th issue of "L'Humanité" put it, they are prepared to "come up with many hollow legal arguments to bury the Soviet proposal, which in any case can serve as the basis for a showdown."

This passage once again proves that the leading countries of the Atlantic bloc, primarily the United States, are already terrified of the people's resolute demands. The peoples of all countries, the peoples of all peace-loving countries, are firmly demanding the cessation of the arms race, the cessation of stockpiling atomic bombs; they are demanding resolutions to prohibit atomic weapons, establish strict international supervision, and implement these two measures simultaneously; they are demanding resolutions to truly reduce armaments and armed forces, not just talk about reducing armaments on paper as proposed by the United States, Britain, and France.

The Soviet Union has proposed a comprehensive and effective plan for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of international supervision.

It is not surprising that the important proposals made by the Soviet delegation regarding the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of international supervision were casually dismissed by the representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and certain other countries in the same camp. These gentlemen hastily came up with various "arguments" and "reasons," always trying to avoid discussing the substance of our proposals. They do not dare to do this openly, so they rack their brains to find excuses and pretexts, nitpicking and finding fault where there is none, and using all their diplomatic tricks to cover up their refusal to support our proposals. Here we see a true example of diplomatic deception!

The Brazilian representative accused us of trickery. I do not want to call the methods used by the Brazilian representative and the representatives of the entire Anglo-American bloc here trickery. Everything they do here is deception, or it can be called a circus act of swallowing swords, which does not require any skill. To make this act successful, only two conditions are needed: quick hands and a gullible audience. In such circumstances, a representative like the Brazilian can hope to succeed. As for the proposals of the United States, Britain, and France, it is entirely reasonable to say that this proposal is sheer fraud on a major issue! Indeed, what value do the proposals of the United States, Britain, and France have compared to ours?

The purpose of this proposal is to prevent the United Nations General Assembly from adopting proposals to prohibit atomic weapons and establish international supervision. Its intention can also be inferred from the remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles in Washington yesterday.

Mr. Dulles insists that we are still trying to make the prohibition of atomic weapons a "paper declaration," and we do not offer any guarantees for any effective control system that would make this prohibition a reality.

Previously, they told us that declaring the prohibition of atomic weapons without establishing a control mechanism was a prohibition on paper. Now they say that prohibiting atomic weapons while establishing international supervision is also a prohibition on paper. Then, how can atomic weapons be truly prohibited? It seems that it is probably the proposal to "regulate, limit, and balance the reduction of all armed forces and all armaments," where it is said that not a single word was mentioned about the prohibition of atomic weapons, but only empty talk about the tasks of the control mechanism—to draft proposals that would lead to the prohibition of atomic weapons.

The Canadian representative asked us if we agree that "international control and inspection should be long-term." On this question, I must point out that since this is a question about the international control mechanism, then asking in this way is meaningless. The question is clear: after the control mechanism is established, since it is not said to be a temporary mechanism, every sensible person should understand that it is long-term. As for the inspection, the Canadian representative also talked about some meaningless things, which made people despair of him. Look, isn't it clearly stated in the sixth item, second point of our proposal that the inspection is long-term? But why did the representatives of Canada and other countries not raise these questions when the United States, Britain, and France proposed their schemes—which they now admit are essentially the same as ours? I will answer this question: because at that time you did not need to raise your questions to muddy the waters. Now the appropriate time has come. Of course, people must find the appropriate time to fish, especially in muddy waters.

They want to know what "strict international supervision" means. I must explain that I do not intend to satisfy the curiosity of these representatives. We are not in school, we are not schoolchildren, and you are not teachers or inspectors; like you, who shamelessly say—pardon my language—that you do not need to study this issue here, then I do not intend to explain to you, I do not intend to explain to you the special significance of certain issues. I think it is inappropriate for our delegation to do so.

If I mention this issue, it is only to enable everyone who truly cares about the truth to be able to distinguish for themselves what our proposals mean and what your questions mean.

They ask, "What exactly does 'strict international supervision' mean?" But we have repeatedly talked about the meaning of the control system, which is completely different from the "Baruch Plan."

As early as October 1951, the Soviet government leader Stalin pointed out the true nature of the American plan for the "control" of the prohibition of atomic weapons: "American figures also talk about 'control,' but their 'control' does not start from stopping the production of atomic weapons, but to continue this production, the amount of which is determined by the amount of raw materials each country has. Therefore, American 'control' does not start from the prohibition of atomic weapons, but to make this weapon legal and legitimate. Therefore, the right of the war-mongers to use atomic weapons to annihilate tens of thousands of peaceful civilians becomes legal. It is not difficult to understand that this is not control, but a mockery of control, a deception of the peaceful wishes of the peoples of all countries. It is clear that such 'control' cannot satisfy the peoples of all countries who demand the prohibition of atomic weapons and the cessation of atomic weapon production."

As for the Soviet Union, as for us, what is our proposal for the establishment of effective international supervision? This proposal includes a series of extremely important measures.

These are: first, inspect all factories producing atomic raw materials and atomic energy, and audit their accounts; second, inspect the existing inventory of atomic raw materials, supplies, and semi-finished products; third, conduct necessary research on production activities to control the use of atomic materials and atomic energy; fourth, supervise the implementation of the already established rules on technical control—not general control but technical control—and not only supervise the implementation, but also have the right to set technical control rules for atomic raw material processing enterprises and other enterprises that handle atomic raw materials, that is, according to our proposal, the control mechanism can set the technical rules it deems necessary for any enterprise that handles atomic raw materials; fifth, the control mechanism has the right to collect and organize information about the refining of atomic raw materials; sixth, it has the right to collect information about the production of atomic raw materials and atomic energy; seventh, in addition to ordinary inspections, if there is suspicion of violating the decision to prohibit atomic weapons, special inspections can be conducted; and so on. Does this not clearly explain that our proposal for international supervision is serious? This proposal, I firmly believe, can withstand all honest and conscientious criticism. However, of course, it cannot withstand criticism from those without conscience, because there is no guarantee for dishonest behavior. We have explained all this before. However, they still bring up all the questions from beginning to end, which is obviously because they have nothing to do. Those who raise these questions often have too much free time and do not know how to spend it. So, they sit down and make up such questions to compete with the smartest people. We all see that they have a lot of time to do this kind of thing. But they do not have enough time to think and study the books they mention. For example, the Haitian representative mentioned a certain "Russian writer of the 18th century," Lyonyov, and even quoted his words. However, in fact, Lyonyov was not a writer at all, but only a Moscow censor, although he did write a few poorly written novels. Now, he is described by the Haitian representative as the "ancestor of Slavic expansionism."

I am willing to affirm that the Haitian representative has never read the books written by Lyonyov, nor has he even seen them. What he used was only a tampered version provided by some spy who was willing to serve him. There are people willing to be such spies, especially when being a spy can earn dollars or pounds—of course, not Haitian currency.

What about the Canadian representative? The Canadian representative wants to show how learned he is, showing that he even understands the science of Marxism, saying that there is a "pamphlet," which he says is called something like "two steps forward, one step back." What he is talking about is the great work of Lenin, called "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back," not "two steps forward, one step back" as the Canadian representative said. Obviously, he has not read this book at all. One must admit that having a polite conversation with such opponents is difficult. It is indeed difficult. Although I have done my best to be polite to suit the tastes of those who are not satisfied with me, I still cannot be smooth with these people, because their thoughts are too shameless and self-righteous, and they think they can evade anything. They and their nonsense and fake "scholarship" should be exposed to the world.

The United States, Britain, and France do not want to truly prohibit atomic weapons but only talk about irrelevant issues.

I must say a few words about Mr. Gross's speech. I cannot hide my surprise at everything I heard here. I do not want to talk too much about this, because basically, what Gross said, we have already discussed. But there is one point worth noting. In concluding his speech, he said that the U.S. government would submit an important proposal to the Disarmament Commission. This is what he said. I have been patiently waiting for the U.S. government's important proposal. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.

I learned from Mr. Dulles's remarks at a press conference in Washington yesterday that he, Dulles, did not know and had not heard of this so-called important proposal that the U.S. government was supposed to submit to the Disarmament Commission.

Perhaps Mr. Gross is secretly preparing this "important proposal" behind Dulles's back. Perhaps he has not prepared this proposal at all, but is just saying it to block the way for the Soviet proposal to be submitted. If Dulles's words are correct, then it proves that Gross has no proposals. In that case, Mr. Gross, your superior has refuted your statement yesterday. Obviously, what Gross said about the U.S. government preparing to submit an important proposal to the Disarmament Commission is malicious.

The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France are trying to divert our proposal to the Disarmament Commission, preventing the General Assembly from considering this proposal.

My friend, the head of the Ukrainian delegation, has already said here that not long ago, these representatives were desperately trying to prevent their proposal from being submitted to the Disarmament Commission, demanding that it be considered here, in the Political Committee and the General Assembly. But now it seems they have taken a completely different stance. When the "three countries" (the United States, Britain, and France) need to do so, they demand that their proposal be considered here, and they give reasons: "If it is not accompanied by instructions, it cannot be submitted to the commission." Now we say: consider our proposal here. They say: "It should be submitted to the commission without instructions."

But in the end, it is impossible to work together in this way. When it is to their advantage, they say one thing, and when it is not to their advantage, they say another. This is the ethical view of the South African Hottentots, which is: stealing someone else's wife is a crime; stealing someone else's wife is fine.

It is impossible to reach an agreement with those who follow this ethical view. The three-country representatives all say that they will vote against the consideration of our proposal in the First Committee and the General Assembly, and will do their best to submit our proposal to the Twelve-Nation Commission for "study." This alone shows the true intention of the respectable three-country representatives, who use one standard for their own proposal and another standard for the Soviet proposal on the same issue. But this is not ethics, this is a trick, a conspiracy. Some Paris newspapers call it a "typical delaying tactic." I want to say that this is not a typical delaying tactic, but a typical tactic to obstruct our proposal; this is not only a delaying tactic, but also a tactic to confuse public opinion. The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France do not dare to defend their stance in front of public opinion, fearing the condemnation of public opinion, and are willing to distort facts and distort our position.

Hearing the speeches of people like Lloyd, Gross, and Shovell is indeed laughable. They only talk about irrelevant issues, but do not give a clear opinion on our proposal. This proposal is clear. We propose that the United Nations General Assembly declare the prohibition of atomic weapons and establish an international control mechanism, which means that the implementation of this ban and the establishment of the control mechanism should be simultaneous. Those who criticize us only replace one question with another question, without discussing anything substantial. They only say: "Submitting such a proposal is not enough to remove obstacles." But they do not say a word about the substance of our proposal, although our proposal can and indeed removes these obstacles. There is only one obstacle it does not remove, and it cannot remove, which is the obstacle that the gentlemen who advocate atomic bombs, the figures of the Atlantic bloc, are completely unwilling to truly prohibit atomic weapons and establish a true international control mechanism under any conditions. On this issue, these gentlemen have retreated on all fronts, forgetting all the things they said during the discussion of the reduction of armaments and armed forces in this First Committee.

Indeed, at that time, they desperately tried to prove that without the establishment of international supervision or before the convention on the establishment of international supervision is concluded, the United Nations General Assembly declaring the prohibition of atomic weapons is unacceptable. On December 3, 1951, the French representative Moc said: "The Soviet proposal to prohibit atomic weapons deprives France of its guarantee in the current tense situation." He said: "If France had atomic bombs, France would agree to the destruction of atomic bombs only when it was sure that other countries were also destroying their atomic bombs at the same time."

However, he said, if the Soviet Union insists on prohibiting atomic weapons without establishing any control measures, there is no hope of success. He went on to say, however, he believed that compromise between the two sides was possible, and that an agreement could be reached on the two stages of declaring the prohibition of atomic weapons and establishing international supervision. He thought that once a compromise resolution was passed, the production of atomic weapons could be stopped sooner.

But at that very meeting, Moc himself refuted his own words! (Incidentally, Moc no longer dares to speak here, obviously to avoid an embarrassing situation.) He said at the time: "The Soviet proposal to first prohibit atomic weapons and stop the production of atomic weapons and then implement supervision must be accepted only after there is a completely trusting atmosphere among the four countries attending the small committee. And now there is no such atmosphere, so for the sake of reaching an agreement, it is necessary for the Soviet Union to no longer insist on this condition."

Now, everyone can see that we no longer insist on this condition. Everyone can see that in the proposal submitted to the First Committee for consideration on January 12, we proposed the principle of simultaneous implementation of the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of international supervision.

On December 6, the same Moc again talked about the possibility of "seeking a common basis for solving the problem of simultaneous implementation." He said that it was possible to reach an agreement on the declaration of the prohibition of atomic weapons, which could be implemented after the establishment of international supervision. This was the French representative's statement at the time.

And now what kind of statement do we hear? Now we hear a completely different statement from the French representative. So what happened? At first, a so-called French representative came and made a speech. After he finished, he left. Then another so-called French representative came to take his place and made a completely different speech. This person finished speaking, unfortunately, did not step down; in fact, he did not need to step down, because he did not contradict himself, and his words contradicted the words of another person who represented the same government, it was completely irrelevant. Especially because this government no longer exists, so it is even more irrelevant. Here, we are like watching someone perform magic: one person comes up, says something, and leaves. Then another person comes up and says something completely opposite, but this person still stands there, waiting to see the reaction to his actions. And these two people both say: we are representatives of the French government, and not only representatives of the French government, but also representatives of the American and British governments. As soon as I expressed doubt about this, someone from a certain Atlantic bloc country immediately said: "How can you doubt? He is a representative of the people!"

But we all know that these representatives are produced by elections with various restrictions, and are produced by election fraud. It is easy to imagine what kind of people's representatives they will be. You can know this from many places, for example, from the famous work of the American sociologist Briss, "American Democracy." From this book, you can see how those who try to become "people's representatives" in so-called "democratic" countries operate.

The representative of the United States of America in this committee has also been replaced. First, there was one representative, now there is another. Indeed, when it is necessary to deny his previous stance, he did not leave here. But because he does not have the courage to openly change his stance, he is now trying to do so in disguise, but very clumsily. It can be said: all these disguises are too thin.

But this is not the issue we are talking about now. The issue we are talking about now is: they—the representatives of the United States of America, Britain, and France—are all acting according to a plan, each person here not only represents his own country, but also represents all three countries. They previously took a stance and had a goal: "Without international supervision, it is impossible to prohibit atomic weapons." "International supervision must be established, otherwise, the prohibition of atomic weapons will only be a piece of paper, only a fantasy." They shouted in unison.

They said: "First supervision, then prohibition." They thought: we are defending the plan of "first prohibition, then supervision," which is the main flaw in our proposal.

Now, let us try, and not care about what others will tell us that we proposed proposals in 1948 and 1949—we will not be flustered by this, of course, if our proposals are good, repeating this proposal is not a crime. We are now proposing another plan, which proposes: the United Nations General Assembly must declare the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of international supervision, and stipulate that the first step and the second step must be implemented simultaneously. In this way, it can be seen that our current proposal is not just a repetition of what we proposed in 1948 and 1949. In 1948, we did not propose a proposal for the simultaneous implementation of the prohibition of atomic weapons and international supervision. In 1949, we proposed the drafting of two conventions for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the control of atomic energy. Now, I am proposing: the United Nations General Assembly should immediately declare the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, stipulating that the prohibition of atomic weapons will come into effect at the same time as the establishment of international supervision.

But now, although we propose: "The prohibition and supervision will come into effect simultaneously, will be implemented simultaneously," no one says to us: "Good, we accept," nor does anyone say to us: "This is not good, we refuse to accept," but someone asks us: "What does 'come into effect' mean?"

But everyone should understand: "Will come into effect" means: they will begin to be implemented.

If you pay attention, you will find: they have realized that they can no longer insist on their original views, so they now propose new views. One of the representatives in their camp said yesterday: only when it can be proven that the international control system is effectively in operation, can atomic weapons be prohibited.

Is it difficult to understand what this means? Is it not clear that there is room for maneuver here, so that in the future it can be said: "No, although there is supervision, although it has been implemented, it is not effective."

This is the meaning of this "small amendment" to the "effectiveness" of supervision! We will agree—and this amendment should be understood in this way: to prohibit atomic weapons at the same time as the establishment of supervision, but here, you must agree in advance that supervision will be effective.

At this point, it should be noted that: in 1949, Mr. Osborn, the representative of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, said: it is impossible to have general effective supervision.

But this "amendment" about effective supervision can only have one purpose, that is: to drown out the issue of the prohibition of atomic weapons in the empty talk about effective supervision.

At first, they said to us: "Are you advocating the prohibition of atomic weapons first and then the implementation of supervision?" Now we say: "The prohibition and supervision should be implemented simultaneously." They no longer respond to this proposal, but ask many questions, and do not want to discuss these questions, but only talk about the "effectiveness" of supervision, making this a new condition for the implementation of the prohibition of atomic weapons. All this has only one purpose: to make the prohibition of atomic weapons impossible; to make it completely impossible to reach an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons. The three-country proposal recently passed by the Anglo-American bloc also reflects this. This proposal does not advocate the prohibition of atomic weapons at all.

The representative of the United States, Yessup, when talking about our proposal that the General Assembly declare the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and establish international supervision, said: the simple and groundless declaration that countries do not produce new atomic bombs and do not use existing atomic bombs cannot be asked of anyone to believe.

He said that before the international control system for the production of atomic weapons and the storage of raw materials used to manufacture atomic bombs is implemented, the declaration of the prohibition of atomic weapons will only be a prohibition on paper; he said that only when that system is implemented, the prohibition can be implemented, and supervision can be carried out.

All three of these people—the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France—are stubbornly trying to create a situation in which the prohibition of atomic weapons must be combined with international supervision, and, as Yessup said, this prohibition must be concretely manifested by international supervision, not by a "mere declaration"—such a declaration, in their view, is illusory if it is not based on international supervision. Now everyone can see that the Soviet proposal submitted to the First Committee on January 12 provides a solution, which cannot be criticized by the so-called declaration of the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons being just empty talk. To destroy our request for the United Nations General Assembly to declare the prohibition of atomic weapons, they tell us that since the proposal advocates the simultaneous implementation of the prohibition of atomic weapons and international supervision, there is no need for such a declaration. Such reasoning is groundless. Undoubtedly, even if the United Nations General Assembly only declares the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, it will have a great and beneficial spiritual impact, and will have a major political impact on efforts to ease international tensions and eliminate the threat of another world war. The United Nations General Assembly declares the prohibition of atomic weapons, which will condemn all propaganda for atomic weapons, and will definitely not result in the incredible facts reported by a French newspaper today. I am referring to the sale of "atomic bomb attack" toys in a large Paris store, "Hôtel de Ville Market," with an attached advertisement, which, when translated word for word, is as follows: "Children's magazines talk about the story of atomic bombs overthrowing rifles and cannons. This game is the same. Now this new game shows that the action of atomic bombs depends on the importance of the bombing target, and the bombing target is marked with numbers according to their military value."

The instructions are accompanied by a map marking "bombing targets." They begin to corrupt children, cultivate children's interest in atomic weapons, and poison their minds with atomic psychology. Is this not the last stage of the decline of so-called "European culture," "European civilization"? This is the result of learning from the example of the United States, learning the "American way of life." For France, this is just the beginning. However, such facts are not uncommon in the United States, where war propaganda, especially propaganda for atomic war, has reached astonishing proportions, and has taken the form of the barbaric performances of the savages in the American "Collier's" magazine, despite the fact that the U.S. representative voted in favor of the prohibition of war propaganda in the United Nations in 1947.

It is precisely because of this that we say: atomic weapons must be prohibited immediately, and this prohibition must be declared in the name of the United Nations General Assembly. Such a declaration of the prohibition of atomic weapons will leave no loopholes, because it stipulates that the prohibition of atomic weapons must be implemented simultaneously with the establishment of supervision, so it is completely possible to check at any time whether this prohibition is strictly enforced.

Therefore, refusing to support our proposal is particularly harmful and dangerous. However, such a refusal is not unexpected.

Everyone can remember that we have long foreseen this situation. We have pointed out that on this issue, the differences of opinion between the Western countries and the Soviet Union all boil down to one reason, that is, the United States, with the support of Britain and France, has always stubbornly tried to prevent an agreement on atomic weapons, so that they can freely stockpile more atomic bombs, thinking that one day they will need these things against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving peoples.

They talk about the resolution of "regulating, limiting, and balancing the reduction of all armed forces and all armaments" (Document A-2025). However, from the text of this resolution, it can be seen, and the future work of the Disarmament Commission will undoubtedly prove, that this resolution does not provide any solution to the problem of the prohibition of atomic weapons. Therefore, the Soviet proposal that the United Nations General Assembly must declare the prohibition of atomic weapons and establish supervision remains as powerful as before.

However, in this regard, obstacles have been created by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France. They say that given the current situation of mutual distrust in international relations, the mere declaration of the prohibition of atomic weapons by the United Nations General Assembly will not have much effect. They say that mere promises, declarations, and guarantees are of no use, what is needed is something more substantial, more significant. What is needed is action. This action is supervision, so it can be seen whether the promises and declarations are sincere, whether these promises and declarations are honestly and strictly followed.

We have shown our willingness to remove this obstacle. There are some countries that, even after the United Nations General Assembly declares the prohibition of atomic weapons, when other countries, other countries that take a sincere attitude towards the decision of the United Nations General Assembly, strictly follow this decision and truly stop continuing to manufacture atomic weapons, will still ignore the sincerity of other countries and continue to manufacture atomic weapons. We now want to create a situation so that the declaration of the prohibition of atomic weapons does not leave loopholes for these countries. The conditions of the Soviet proposal can completely achieve this purpose. As for the issue of international supervision, I would like to draw the committee's attention to the third and sixth items of this proposal, which discuss the establishment of long-term international supervision. The term "long-term" was also proposed in the three-country proposal of "regulating, limiting, and balancing the reduction of all armed forces and all armaments."

Lloyd and Yessup have repeatedly said that if the words "long-term" are added to our proposal, it will be clear, and according to Mr. Lloyd, if it is like this, he will consider this item in our proposal to be roughly the same as the second and third items in the original three-country proposal. Yessup has also said similar things, saying: effective investigation itself must be continuous investigation. He even said that the only possible way is continuous investigation. He has said this many times, and has expressed his basic idea in various ways, which is: the supervision of atomic energy must be continuous. Lloyd said on December 11, 1951, in his speech to the First Committee, that our proposal on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of international supervision is a phased proposal, the first phase is the decision of the General Assembly to prohibit atomic weapons and establish international supervision, the second phase is the drafting of the international control system, and the third phase is the establishment of the control mechanism. (Incidentally, this analysis is incorrect.) Lloyd said that such a method is unacceptable, because if supervision is not implemented, a situation will arise where the cessation of the production of atomic bombs and the use of atomic weapons is completely determined by the promises of individual governments.

The above-mentioned Soviet proposal must be taken seriously, and this proposal must be correctly evaluated, without stubbornly insisting on your own proposal. Your own proposal is unacceptable, because your proposal is absolutely untenable.

If the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France continue to be so stubborn, insisting on their proposal of "first supervision, then prohibition" of atomic weapons, and continuing to insist on implementing supervision according to the Baruch Plan, then undoubtedly, on the issue of the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of a control mechanism to supervise the implementation of this prohibition, it will be completely impossible to reach a true agreement due to this proposal.

They insist on establishing an international control system according to the Baruch Plan, and by doing so, they have already doomed the work of those who strive to reach an agreement as possible to be in vain. If an agreement is to be reached, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France must first abandon their discriminatory attitude towards the proposals of other countries—especially when such a proposal is a proposal to simultaneously implement the prohibition of atomic weapons and establish international supervision, they are even more discriminatory. A hole must be dug from both ends. Both sides must make efforts, otherwise, an agreement cannot be reached. We are not just saying this, we are also doing it.

Of course, it is impossible to overlook Lloyd's speech. His speech is particularly intended to cover up the clear rejection of the Soviet proposal, and the attitude of the British government is exactly this attitude. Lloyd, in doing so, tries to be ambiguous, not saying a clear word, but it is this attitude that clearly reveals the clear rejection of the Soviet proposal. From beginning to end, he said some words expressing various doubts, he not only doubted the individual words that express the basic issues of the Soviet proposal, but also doubted the entire Soviet proposal. But the issue is not about the meaning of certain individual words, the issue is—this may be something Lloyd himself did not expect—that the proposal we put forward, which stipulates the simultaneous implementation of the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of international supervision, is not in the interest of British policy. Lloyd himself had to admit this.

Lloyd nitpicks about everything. At the small committee meeting on December 5, 1951, Lloyd accused us of omitting the words "long-term" from the amendment to the three-country proposal on the issue of supervision, and wanted us to agree to add these two words. He explained at length that he did not approve of the word "permanent," but advocated the word "long-term," because this word stipulates a permanent system and procedure, making it possible to conduct inspections at any time. Everyone knows that our proposal repeatedly mentions the words "long-term," and this proposal is no longer in need of further explanation, at least it is not in need of further explanation to Lloyd, because when he defended this proposal in the small committee, he was obviously completely clear about the meaning of this proposal. And now what? Now he finds a lot of problems, a lot of questions in this regard. He asked: does such a mechanism have the right to exercise supervision only over so-called reported armament factories? Where will the inspection mechanism be located? He said there are many other similar questions.

Lloyd suddenly found all these problems very serious, as if there was no other way, only to submit our proposal to the Twelve-Nation Commission for careful study. But these childish arguments can deceive whom? However, what seems to bother Lloyd the most now is our proposal about long-term inspections that "have no right to illegally interfere in domestic affairs." He feels that this is an "unpleasant moment," which is the cause of his anxiety. People can understand the anxiety of the British representative because of our proposal that there is no interference in domestic affairs. For those who have always been arrogant and acted like masters on foreign soil, for those imperialist gentlemen, this proposal is indeed, as Lloyd said, an "unpleasant moment." The reaction of the representatives of the imperialist camp to our proposal shows how important this proposal is.

This proposal clearly states the issue of not interfering in domestic affairs, which is extremely clear, because this proposal is completely in line with the most important principle of the United Nations, that is, the principle stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the Charter: "The present Charter shall not be construed as authorizing the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state..."

But perhaps this clause is not clear enough to Lloyd, perhaps it needs to be explained in some way.

The peace-loving countries implement the Soviet peace plan to guarantee the elimination of the threat of another world war

I have summarized the results of the four-day discussion of the "measures to eliminate the threat of another world war and strengthen international peace and friendship" in this committee. From this, I cannot help but think that the various points raised by the representatives of various countries, from various aspects and to various degrees, criticizing our proposals, are all intended to reject the prohibition of atomic weapons; because these points not only want to make the prohibition of atomic weapons depend on the establishment of the international control mechanism (this issue has been resolved, at least on our side, it can be said so), but also want to make it depend on the effectiveness of this control (which I have already talked about), which of course means that they do not want to reach an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons.

The proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation on January 12 is an important and serious step to solve the various problems of measures to eliminate the threat of another war and strengthen international peace and friendship. For this reason, we insist on our eight proposals.

We firmly insist that participating in the Atlantic Pact should be incompatible with the status of a member of the United Nations organization. We demand that the General Assembly declare the immediate cessation of hostilities in Korea and take the measures stipulated in our proposal to achieve this purpose. We firmly insist that the General Assembly declare the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and establish an international control mechanism, and stipulate that this prohibition and this supervision should be implemented simultaneously. We insist that the General Assembly propose to the Security Council's five permanent members to reduce their respective armaments and armed forces by one-third within one year.

We insist that the General Assembly propose that after the decisions to prohibit atomic weapons and reduce armed forces by one-third are made, all countries must submit complete and reliable information about their respective armaments and armed forces—including atomic weapons—and information about military bases in foreign countries. We propose to establish an international control mechanism under the Security Council, based on the principle of long-term inspections. We propose to convene a world conference to discuss the issue of disarmament. We propose that the General Assembly propose that the governments of the five major powers conclude a peace treaty and propose that all peace-loving countries participate in this treaty. Some people say to us: the five-power peace treaty is not necessary, because there is already a sixty-nation treaty—the United Nations Charter. But if there is already a sixty-nation treaty, why is the Atlantic Treaty still needed? Why is the European bloc still needed? Why is the Pan-American Treaty still needed? If there is already a treaty in the form of our Charter with sixty nations, why are there still so many bilateral and multilateral treaties?

Obviously, this objection is purely an excuse, aiming to prevent this extremely important treaty (this treaty is the agreement of the five major powers that can maintain peace) from being concluded. We still insist on concluding such a treaty.

We are convinced that if the genuine peace plan outlined above, and as expressed in our proposal, is adopted and implemented by all peace-loving countries, then it will indeed be possible to guarantee the elimination of the threat of another world war and strengthen international peace and friendship.

　　论消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施
    ——维辛斯基一月十七日在联合国大会政治委员会上的演说
    关于“消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施”的辩论业已表明，有些代表团在按照小心翼翼地制订的策略计划行事，这种计划目的在阻挠对苏联代表团提出的建议进行严肃认真的讨论。这些代表的发言的性质与论调，他们所提出的论据，他们发言时所作的批评的倾向，他们的角色的分配，所有这一切都表明，他们事先是有着勾结的，这种勾结，目的就是要避免讨论苏联代表团在一九五二年一月十二日所提出的提案的实质。
    下面的事实就确实证明了是有这种阴谋存在的，大西洋集团的各国代表团向我们提出了一些完全同样的问题——所谓不明确、引起怀疑和需要解释的问题！美国、英国、加拿大、玻利维亚和其他一些国家的代表，就像受着指挥一样，提出了同样的问题。这确实不是偶然的，例如他们都问：“付诸实行”是什么意思；“同时”应如何了解；国际管制机构是一个什么样的东西；它是不是要长期执行职务等等。
    他们提出这些问题只不过是一种手段，用来规避讨论苏联的建议的实质，并借口这些建议应由所谓裁减军备委员会来研究，而主张把这些建议转交给那个委员会。
    情形就是这样，这一点还可以从这种事实看出来：这些代表们在提出了一大堆问题后，就像一个人似地说：不可能在这里，在政委会里讨论这些问题，而且实际上也不必要在这里讨论这些问题，因为已经成立了裁减军备委员会。美国、英国、加拿大、法国、玻利维亚、巴西和其他一些国家的代表都公然这样说，他们建议把整个问题都转交裁减军备委员会讨论。
    这就表明：有些代表不是讨论苏联的建议的实质，而只是沉溺于空谈与议程毫无关系的东西，这就暴露出他们对于制订消除另一次战争威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施一点也不感兴趣。既然毫无疑问是有勾结的情形，那么也就说明为什么某些代表在发言中又令人发呕地对苏联进行诬蔑和粗暴的攻击了，他们这样做的目的显然是要尽可能把水搅混——大家知道混水摸鱼比较容易些——以比较便于规避基本的、重要的问题的讨论，并且以比较便于歪曲事实、甚至曲解事实的手段来欺骗舆论。
    美英侵略阵营代表们事先勾结竟歪曲事实阻挠讨论苏联建议
    在这一方面，有好几个代表打破了一切纪录，卑鄙到捏造最离奇可笑的东西，散布最可耻的谎言和诽谤。海地代表甚至发表了一大套关于“斯拉夫扩张主义”的谬论，他诽谤中伤我们，并且试图诽谤苏联外交政策。他在谈到芬兰法西斯分子在一九三九年对苏联发动的军事冒险时，讲了许多诽谤苏联的话，胆敢在这里为不光荣的国联在这个问题上所采取的可耻立场辩解，并且竟得意忘形地追述他自己在这个国际——姑且这样说吧——组织中的工作。
    当然，作为前国联会员国的代表，他清清楚楚地知道：这个冒险正是那些在强有力的主子支持之下的芬兰法西斯分子所发动的，他们的主子一方面是希特勒的德国，另一方面是包括希特勒的朋友——以张伯伦和达拉第为首的一批人在内的国联。他还知道：那个时候，芬兰统治集团已经和希特勒分子结成了联盟，并且让他们把芬兰领土当成进攻苏联的跳板。可是他却不惜公然歪曲事实，进行诽谤，希图这样来转移政治委员会的注意力，使它不讨论当前的重要问题。
    显然，他是抱着同样目的从下列美国国务院的档案中拿出一堆诽谤之词来重说一遍的：这就是国务院在一九四八年一月底用“一九三九至一九四一年纳粹与苏联间的关系”这个神秘的题目出版的汇编。过去就已无可辩驳地证明了：出版这个汇编的美国历史伪造者，想靠编选所谓由希特勒的外交部获得的各种伪造文件，来诽谤苏联并缩小苏联作为反对反民主的侵略势力的真正忠贞不屈的民主战士和坚定不移的和平战士而发生的国际影响。
    国务院的这种企图那时就已被揭露了。诽谤者那时就已被当场捉住，而且被戴上了枷锁。
    但是，显然这些大人先生们所获得的这种光荣使某些代表不能安心，这些代表正在这里设法再度使用美国伪造品，希图这样可以有助于破坏千百万人对苏联的信任，千百万人正确地认为苏联是反对新战争威胁的坚持不渝的、忠贞不屈的战士，认为它是和平战士。
    这里，海地代表又把美国的历史伪造者在一九四八年对于苏德互不侵犯条约所散布的诽谤谰言，重复了一遍。当然，他是不会不知道这件事的真相的。他当然知道，那时正是第二次世界大战爆发的前夕，以美国为后台老板的英法集团，正在特别紧张地进行活动来孤立苏联，来鼓励希特勒德国转向东方，鼓励它攻击那个曾经得到英法集团的“保证”的地主波兰以及苏联。他当然知道，既然英、法两国在美国的支持下采取了这样的政策，苏联就没有别的道路可以选择，只有接受关于缔结这个条约的建议，因为这是一切可能的出路中的最好的一条出路。这个选择是苏联外交政策在这种情况下所采取的明智的、有远见的步骤。苏联政府的这一步骤，在极大程度上，预先决定了苏联和一切爱好自由的人民在第二次世界大战中终于取得胜利。这次大战的结局是希特勒德国的覆灭，而在击败希特勒德国方面起决定性作用的乃是苏联及其光荣的军队。
    在这里，谈一谈下面的事并不是多余的：早在一九三四年，以英法为其盟国的地主波兰和德国缔结了互不侵犯条约。一九三八年，作为欧洲主要国家的英、法两国也和希特勒匪帮缔结互不侵犯条约，还发表了一篇英德、法德互不侵犯宣言。
    很明显，海地代表关于一九三九年苏德条约的谰言，是打算利用一切手段（包括诽谤在内）来设法掩饰一下他的主子的政策，因为这个政策引起了一切爱好和平人民和全体进步人类的惯慨和抗议。
    我用了一些时间来谈论海地代表的发言，不是因为这个发言本身值得注意，而只是要弄清楚海地代表及其同伙所扮演的可耻角色。他们这样做的目的是要给他们的有权有势的主子服务，他们的主子本身就是毫不尊重事实而又喜欢胡说八道、造谣诬蔑的。这个阵营的其他一些代表也是不惜歪曲事实来造谣中伤的。
    事实证明大西洋集团的侵略性所谓“防务”是掩盖它的侵略目的
    秘鲁代表在这里发表了一种古怪的——我们姑且不用别的更重的字眼——理论”。尽管这个秘鲁人作了十分复杂的解释，这种“理论”的论点却是很明显的。
    他的发言概括起来就是说：从事物的本性来看，苏联是必然要“扩张”的——扩张领土，扩大对其他国家的影响；而美国的命运就是要“保卫自己”——采取某种措施来克服“压倒一切的巨大力量”，为“保卫自己——这是用秘鲁代表的话——而反抗这种力量”。从这里就可以直接得出一个结论：大西洋公约是完全符合宪章条款的必要的自卫行动。至于宪章呢，照秘鲁代表的话说，是表达比宪章的历史还要悠久的正义的。
    秘鲁代表显然已经感觉到这样的发言不能达到目的，于是便求援于英国外交大臣的威信，提到他最近在哥伦比亚大学的演说。他说，这个演说最适当地表明了大西洋集团的所谓和平政策，“最明确而忠实地对大西洋集团的原则、宗旨和任务给了一个估价”。但是，只要翻阅一下艾登先生的演说，便不难看出，艾登先生关于大西洋公约和大西洋集团的发言，全部都是重述美国的所谓“有实力的局势”理论，或者是加以发挥一下而已。
    关于大西洋集团，艾登先生在哥伦比亚大学的演说中说，如果为了“大西洋防务”而有必要，英国政府驻在各地的军队将继续留驻原地。
    我们早就知道，大西洋集团靠种种关于“防务”的鬼话来掩盖它的侵略目的。假如的确像碧朗第先生所说的那样，艾登先生这个演说可以看作是三大国政策的最适当表现，那么从这个演说里摘录出来的这段话恐怕要算是说明大西洋集团侵略本质的最好的证据了。
    美国代表说，大西洋集团的目标正是要防止第三次世界大战。但是，我们看到，在大西洋集团中带头的几个国家——美国、英国和法国——的活动恰恰是在远东发动战争，并且在制造另一次世界大战的危险和威胁。
    面对着这样的事实，还企图把侵略性的大西洋集团说成以巩固和平为目的的组织，那真是完全不负责任、轻浮的举动。然而，某些代表还不仅是发表这样的理论，他们还引用联合国宪章第五十一条和五十二条，企图证明大西洋公约合乎宪章，企图证明参加大西洋集团和联合国会员国资格是并不矛盾的。
    但事实的确是这样吗？
    根本不是这样一回事。这是很容易明白的，只要仔细地研究一下宪章第五十一条、第五十二条以及第五十三条便可以明白。最后一条甚至比前两条能更有力地驳倒所谓大西洋公约符合联合国宪章的说法。
    第五十一条说，联合国组织的会员国如果受到武装进攻，就具有进行个别的或集体的自卫的自然权利。大家都知道，并没有一个国家曾经攻击大西洋集团的任何一个国家，而且也没有发生这种攻击的趋势。已经无需再说什么苏联方面会发动这样的进攻的空话了，因为这种谰言老早就被驳斥和揭露过了。
    我以前已经提到过挪威的事情。它过去曾经表示害怕苏联方面对它会有什么使它不快的行为。可是，当苏联政府向挪威政府建议签订互不侵犯条约时，挪威政府却拒绝了这个建议，而且当即参加了大西洋集团。
    这件事的意思难道还不明白吗？挪威政府和它背后的政府显然很害怕在和苏联签订互不侵犯条约以后，结果可能使挪威不能履行派定给它的任务，这些任务是在它一参加大西洋侵略集团的时候就要派定给它的。这样说来，不仅挪威政府，就是指挥挪威政府的人也承认，如果挪威与任何国家缔结互不侵犯条约，那是和它参加大西洋集团不相容的。这意思就是说，互不侵犯条约是和大西洋公约及大西洋集团不相容的。
    有人在这里提到过关于区域办法的第五十二条。然而，只要研究一下所谓北大西洋地区的界限，就可以相信所谓这个公约只有区域性质的话是虚假的了。
    北大西洋公约并不是区域性的组织，因为它并不限于大西洋地区，而远远超出这个地区的范围以外。所谓北大西洋集团地区竟包括西德、黑海、菲律宾、太平洋，直达中东、近东。
    所以，提到宪章的第五十一条和五十二条是完全没有用的。提到这些条款只能证实、并且也的确证实大西洋公约是违背了宪章第五十一条和第五十二条的，是违背了宪章的原则、宗旨和任务的。
    第五十三条规定：如无安全理事会之授权，不得依区域办法采取任何执行行动；但依照第一百零七条所采取的措施——就是说一国政府对联合国宪章的任何签字国在第二次世界大战中的敌国所采取的行动——不在此限。
    请诸位在大西洋公约中指出符合第五十三条这个规定的一条或一段来吧，就是一个字也好，只要其中有一点点提到大西洋集团须在安全理事会的授权下采取这个执行行动就可以。诸位是办不到这一点的，因为大西洋公约中甚至没有提到第五十三条内那样清楚地、明确地规定的这个重要原则。
    大西洋公约的第五条完全不顾宪章的第五十三条，公然违背了第五十三条。不用说，大家知道：大西洋集团没有获得安全理事会给予它的采取任何执行行动的任何权力，虽然这个集团的首领们现在正大力准备采取这种行动以对付那些不是这个集团的成员国的国家。
    难道这些事实不足以完全驳倒说什么大西洋公约符合宪章而且是在联合国宪章范围以内的胡言乱语吗？
    事情恰恰是这样。因为要想在宪章里为大西洋公约以及大西洋集团的活动找到任何根据，当然是完全不可能的。从法律观点来看事情，便是这样。然而，问题完全不在法律方面，问题不在于大西洋公约发起者从宪章里抄袭来掩饰大西洋公约的侵略活动的这些慈祥的字眼和辞句。
    他们要使我们相信，大西洋集团几乎就是为造福人类而建立的慈善团体。但是，我们从“联合国世界”杂志一九五二年一月号里却可以看到这样的言论。这家杂志驻联合国记者比尔写道：美国之所以建立北大西洋联盟（暂时代替联合国），并不是为了慷慨地帮助弱小国家，而是为了充分加强它们，借以增加美国的威力，利用它们的人力、它们的资源和它们的军事基地。
    这就完完全全戳穿了所谓美国援助、所谓打算援助其他弱小国家的神话！
    另外有一件事也是值得注意的。一九五一年十月四日的“芝加哥论坛报”发表社论说，现在正应该记起麦克阿瑟将军的一句话——要是以为美国处在被苏联或几个国家的联合力量征服的危险中，那是完全没有根据的。美国海军作战部长费泰勒也是抱同样的论调。……“芝加哥论坛报”指出，这意思就是说，美国用不着那么多的防务拨款，而且也许连征兵制度也不需要，美国可以感到很安全。“芝加哥论坛报”指出，北大西洋公约组织并不是要来保证美国的安全的。但是，葛罗斯、劳埃德诸位先生以及他们的朋友们却要使我们相信，“大西洋组织”这个侵略集团成立的唯一目标就是保证美国的安全！
    这许多事实还不足以使称颂大西洋集团的人们的狂热多少冷下来一点吗？他们想尽一切办法，要想在舆论之前隐藏这个公约的侵略本质，要想凭着什么防务、和平和合作等等堂皇字眼来掩盖这怪物的丑恶面貌，欺骗人民。
    无数事实表明，大西洋集团的活动是侵略性的，大西洋集团和什么美国的安全目标毫不相关。这已由大西洋集团各国的整个政策表明了，这政策决定了全世界都知道的它们的一切活动。
    美国夺取世界霸权的疯狂政策必须对造成国际紧张局势负责
    可是，如果“大西洋组织”不是以维持“安全”为目的的，那末，它到底是作什么用的呢？在这种情况下，美国为什么花费那样庞大的款项去执行与大西洋集团的活动有关的战争计划、使美国纳税者担负那样沉重的负担的计划呢？譬如说，从杜鲁门一月给美国国会的咨文中，就看出了这种计划的负担，杜鲁门在咨文中供认，由于安全计划的费用急剧增加，如果不增加税收，预料一九五三财政年度的赤字必定是很大的，几乎要等于一九五二年度赤字的两倍。可是杜鲁门又说，即使税收增加了，赤字仍然会是很大的，这种情况要一直延续到安全计划过了最高限度而开始紧缩的时候为止，这其间的一段时期，根据杜鲁门的希望，要有两三年之久。
    这是一九五三年的情况。一九五二年的情况是怎样的呢？杜鲁门先生说，在到一九五二年六月三十日为止的本财政年度内，预算赤字可能达到八十亿美元左右。又根据他预料，如果不赶快在增加新税这一方面采取有力的措施，那末在这以后，一九五三财政年度的预算赤字就会增加一倍。
    这样看来，两年内美国的预算赤字就要达到二百四十亿美元了。
    这样庞大的赤字，是什么东西造成的呢？杜鲁门说了：是战争计划。这种赤字对人民说是什么意思呢？新的负担。杜鲁门在他给国会的咨文中谈到了新的、沉重的捐税负担。
    我认为必须在这里把这一切都谈一下，以便说明大西洋集团的活动在这个集团的各国国内所造成的经济困难的根源，并说明这些国家的人民所遭受的这种越来越深的苦难真正应该由谁负责。而且，为了要揭露那种把目前情势的责任推到苏联身上的谎言，也是必须把这一切都谈一下的。目前情势的责任，必须由大西洋集团和领导这个集团的美国担负。
    这样看来，北大西洋集团组织就不是维持美国安全所需要的了。它存在一天，它就必须囤积军火，必须行动起来，必须扩大战争计划，必须在社会上维持战争狂——它必须这样做。而且，它也正在这样做。
    这里有人对我们说：“收起你们的辩证法吧！”但是我们的“辩证法”是正确的辩证法。甚至你们那些在思想方法上和我们的“辩证法”完全不同的权威人士都证实了这一点。举刊载在一九五一年十月十日国会记录中的有名的国会议员阿姆斯特朗的言论为例吧。阿姆斯特朗说，不采取其他措施，仅是武器储备，就会导致使用原子武器和氢原子武器的战争。……他说，在整个历史上，军备竞赛从来没有带来过和平，从来没有保证和平的胜利或者促进和平的利益。这话是出自阿姆斯特朗这位名人之口，谁也不能怀疑他会有共产主义生活方式或者共产主义思想方法，虽然你们的非美活动委员会是可以对任何人作任何怀疑的。
    举例说，我们最近听到一个消息，感到非常惊讶。这消息就是三十八位美国参议员请求美国政府把耶塞普先生从这里召回国去，因为他表现了“非美国的思想方法”。不过这里知道耶塞普言行的每一个人都十分清楚，他的思想方法是最地道的美国思想方法。你们看，事情搞到什么地步了！
    阿姆斯特朗又说，应该承认这个无可争辩的事实：制造武器唯一的目的是在军事行动中使用它。
    “得·梅因纪事报”发行人考尔斯在一九五一年十一月二十九日发表的言论中说，他不能同意发疯的美国人的看法；这些美国人认为，现在美国应该诉诸战争，以扑灭共产主义。他说，他不相信可以用武力把共产主义摧毁。他认为，美国人越快地明白不能用美国军力的威胁或用美元收买的方法来按照美国的式样改造世界，那么他们就会越快地制订健全的外交政策。大西洋集团难道不是想用战争的办法扑灭共产主义吗？这难道不是它的目的吗？难道不是这一点决定了建立欧洲集团和建立包括以希特勒复仇主义将领为首的西德军队在内的欧洲军吗？正是这样。上面所引的美国有名的政治和社会领袖的言论证明了这一点。这些人与恶毒的——照美国国务院与“美国之音”的看法——“辩证法”是相去十万八千里的。
    支持大西洋公约的人们要我们放弃关于大西洋集团是侵略集团的见解；他们要我们同意，大西洋集团和我们的组织（按指联合国）是不矛盾的，它的活动是符合联合国宪章的原则的，因为联合国宪章说，必须制止某些国家复活军国主义的任何企图，必须制止点燃战争之火的企图，必须为和平、为解决一切政治、经济、社会、文化及其他问题以巩固国际友好关系而奋斗。
    很明显，那些支持大西洋公约的人们没有看到他们周围发生的事情，没有看到所有明智的人都指出的事情；他们没有看到，美国已经沉溺于夺取世界霸权的疯狂政策；他们不知道，必须对已经形成的国际局势负责的是美国。美国的外交政策引起了社会的惊慌和紧张，这种惊慌和紧张是不能无终止地长此下去的，因为当你把弓拉开的时候，你应该知道，不是箭放出去，就是弓弦断掉。
    难道所有这些事实还不足以使人相信，美国以及美国所指挥的大西洋集团的政策是战争政策，不是和平政策吗？是美国以及大西洋集团的其他成员国已经正在世界各地进行的战争政策吗？
    许多事实证明是美国侵略朝鲜  美代表迄今不敢反驳这些事实
    我们在这里提出了立刻停止在朝鲜的敌对行动的问题。曾经有人在这里要把朝鲜战争说成是联合国对付北朝鲜的“侵略”的一种“防御行动”。美国代表在发言的时候，重复提出了已经几十次被驳倒的关于朝鲜战争的性质和原因的陈腐谰言，而且再一次和从前一样地说，战争是因北朝鲜进攻而开始的。如果这里的一些大人先生们不是那样横暴地要想规避这个问题，不是完全为了要颠倒是非而提出形形色色的形而上学的、诡辩的论调来解释自己的动机的话，我现在也就不会谈这个问题了。
    美国代表提到了朝鲜委员会的报告，可是他没有说明这个委员会是什么样的委员会。我说的并不是一些个人，也不是这些人的每一个人的一般个人品质。大家知道，这个委员会是有着确定的政治任务的；大家也知道，这种政治任务决定这个委员会的全部行动。成立这个委员会是为了执行确定的政治计划，这个计划归根结底说来就是：在搜集真实情报的伪装下，提出材料，为在美国政府支持下的李承晚傀儡政权所发动的侵略进行辩解。
    美国代表说，根据这个委员会的报告，战争是因北朝鲜的进攻而开始的。可是，这个委员会的这种说法，在去年、在前年，都早已被驳倒了。我说这种说法被驳倒了，是因为当时我们提出了一切证据，而美国和英国的代表没有答复。因此，我现在不能忽视他们的无稽之谈，不能忽视他们颠倒是非的企图；他们企图把事实说成好像在联合国的旗帜下开始这个凶杀冒险的不是他们似的，好像他们是在履行联合国会员国的责任似的。他们企图说明，“侵略者”不是他们，而是朝鲜人民。但是事实上，不是北朝鲜军队和中国人民志愿军侵入美国，而恰恰相反，是美国军队侵入朝鲜。
    许多事实证明：对朝鲜人民发动侵略战争而且现在仍然在进行这个战争的，是美国。下面这些事实是值得一提的。这些事实是（我只举其中的一部分）：
    一九五○年六月十九日李承晚在汉城所谓国民议会中当着杜勒斯的面说：“如果我们不能在冷战中保卫民主，我们一定要在热战中取得胜利。”这是战争的威胁，是进攻北朝鲜的威胁，难道还不清楚吗？
    一九五○年五月美国经济合作总署朝鲜分署署长琼逊在美国众议院拨款委员会上说：用美国军械装备、经美军教官训练的十万名南朝鲜军队已经准备完毕，随时可以发动战争。不是自卫，而是发动战争！就在这个期间，李承晚也曾一再说：一九五○年五、六两个月将是朝鲜历史上最危急的时期。
    杜勒斯在一九五○年六月北朝鲜遭受进攻的前五天写信给李承晚说，他十分重视李承晚的国家可能在即将演出的大戏剧中担任决定性的角色。
    必须提请大家注意，这封信是在南朝鲜军队进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国五天以前写的。
    前李承晚内务长官金孝锡承认，一九五○年一月，罗伯茨将军在指示李承晚各长官时说，进攻北朝鲜的计划是已经决定了的事……。金孝锡还说：“虽然我们已经决定要进攻，但是必须制造一个借口，我们才显得有道理。因为这样，最重要的便是联合国委员会的报告。当然，联合国委员会要提出偏袒美国的报告的，但是同时还得注意这件事，必须争取联合国委员会的同情。”
    有一个绝对无可辩驳的文件揭露了到底谁是发动这次对朝鲜人民的战争的真正侵略者。这文件便是李承晚军总部的地图，上面精确地标着李承晚军队的驻扎地点，画着对北朝鲜进攻的路线——只要总部在适当时机发出命令，军队就会按着这些箭头出动。这种种事实和文件都无可辩驳地证明了，准备并实行对北朝鲜攻击的，恰恰是美国。然而，美国和英国代表团的先生们却对这些事实和文件保持沉默。这是完全可以理解的。事实是铁面无情的！这些事实使美国干涉者先生们和他们的朋友们不得不保持沉默。
    然而，这类的事实是越来越多的。这里另外又有一件新的事实，再次证明了事实上的确是美国发动了对北朝鲜的攻击。
    一九五一年十二月号的“世界主义者”杂志发表了麦克阿瑟总部前谍报局局长威洛贝少将的一篇长文。作者承认，在战争爆发之前一个星期，南朝鲜全部军队都已准备就绪，进入三八线沿线的阵地。
    一直到今天为止，美国代表都不曾反驳过这些事实和这一切官方文件。
    美国侵略者一再提出荒谬要求拖延朝鲜谈判并继续进行侵略
    现在的事情是如何停止朝鲜战争、帮助板门店谈判顺利结束。我们已经看到过，对我们这个建议，美英集团曾经怎样反对，而且怎样仍然在反对。
    如果我们仔细听一下美国、英国、菲律宾和其他国家代表在这里发表的关于朝鲜战争的言论，我们便不难看到，他们根本不关心怎样去帮助板门店谈判顺利结束，因此就拒绝对这事给予任何帮助。不仅如此，他们还要欺骗舆论：像美国代表昨天就肯定地说，板门店谈判只剩下少数几个问题没有解决，相信这些问题很快就能够解决。然而，这种说法是不符合事实的，举例说，朝鲜美国第八军军长范佛里特将军的话就足以完全驳倒这种说法。据美联社一月十三日电，范佛里特曾说，朝鲜停战谈判非常令人失望。这说明什么呢？在巴黎这里，美国代表谈到朝鲜谈判时硬说一切都很好，没有解决的问题只剩下很少了，很快就会全部解决的；可是朝鲜美国第八军军长范佛里特将军却说，谈判的情况非常令人失望。后一种说法显然是比较接近真实情况的，因为美国总部现在向对方提出种种荒谬的要求，这种情况不能使人认为这次谈判有成功的希望。
    美国代表在这里说，朝鲜美军总部将尽力谋求实现停战，但他同时又提出了某些保留，使人不能感到谈判有成功的预兆。他在结束他的发言时说，他们渴望谈判，渴望在联合国举行谈判。但他又说：当军事领袖正在设法取得停火协议的时候，是不能具有充分责任来讨论这些问题的。
    然而，这完全是装模作样的假话，因为美国军事领袖们并不想在板门店取得协议。相反的，他们很满意朝鲜局势的发展，因为那里战争还在继续进行着，继续给朝鲜人民带来灾难。据美联社消息，这同一位范佛里特将军还说，他感到满意的是，朝鲜北部破坏得很厉害，以致共产党已经缺乏粮食、衣物和居所，同时北朝鲜人民也处于颇为严重的状态之中。
    这种言论是与美国出席联合国的代表关于他们所谓希望停止军事行动的发言相符合吗？不，不相符合的，绝对不相符合的。
    范佛里特将军的谈话是职业军人的谈话，他只满意于对妇女、小孩、老人、军人、文官、农民、工人、机关工作人员、牧师、医生，总而言之，对任何人进行砍、刺、戮、杀，只满意于破坏、摧毁城市，毁灭整个国家。他看到血流成河，便很高兴。他说：“我心满意足了。……”这是吃人生番的说话。这是吃人生番的心理。有人对我们说：联合国绝对不应该干涉这件事，因为这会妨碍美国“军事领袖”的努力；据说，他们正在为在朝鲜停战协定上达成协议而努力。你们是说范佛里特和李奇微在作这种努力吗？负有使命在朝鲜停战问题上“达成协议”、把这个谈判顺利完成的原来是他们呀！只有伪君子会这样说，只有想掩饰他们的可耻活动的伪君子才会这样说。他们那些可耻的活动已使联合国丧失威信。他们那么不要脸地污辱了联合国的名称！
    不幸的是，在联合国的记录里已经有很多篇幅是写着这类事情了。现在又加了新的一页。这就是，他们准备拒绝我们提案的第二项，这一项要求立即停止敌对行动，立即缔结停战协定，把军队撤离三八线，所有外国军队和外国志愿军都撤出朝鲜。但是所有这些都被拒绝了，被否决了。他们用那些假正经的、假热心的言词、花言巧语般的言词来掩盖他们的行动。但是，现在决定朝鲜的战争与和平问题、决定朝鲜停战问题的人物的真正面貌是由范佛里特和他的支持者暴露出来了。他们现在已经站在深达膝盖的血泊里。这些支持者就是华盛顿的陆军部、国务院和美国政府，这位范佛里特将军就是在它们的同意下说话和行事的。
    我们必须把这一切都考虑到，然后好来衡量我们说下面这句话究竟是对的还是不对的：我们说，大西洋集团是侵略集团，是侵略黑暗势力的窠穴，因而参加这个集团是和联合国的会员国资格不相容的。
    有人对我们说：朝鲜停战完全取决于苏联。只要苏联动一动手指头，战争就可结束。
    这是造谣。这是卑鄙的煽动宣传。我们知道，拖延谈判的是美国方面！为了弄清楚是谁在拖延谈判，只要追述一下美国提出以一对一交换战俘的条件就够了。我们愿意提醒诸位：美国司令部企图在交换战俘以后仍然扣留总数十七万六千战俘当中的十六万五千多人。这是对国际法的破坏，国际法规定全部遣归战俘，一人不留。
    能够同意依照美国司令部提出的这种方法进行交换吗？即使这个要求是像美国这样的大国提出的，是企图扼杀朝鲜的整个大西洋集团提出的，像朝鲜这样的小国可能同意吗？不用说，是不可能同意这种要求的。
    主张按照“一对一”的方法交换战俘的要求严重地违反普遍承认的国际法原则。难道美国政府在一九三二年没有签署一九二九年关于战俘的日内瓦公约吗？难道这个公约内没有包括规定交战双方政府在签订停战协定后必须释放战俘并遣送他们回家的第七十五条吗？
    难道一九二九年的公约内的这一条提供可能，使美国将领们得以在朝鲜谈判中提出他们现在的“一对一”的要求吗？难道美国没有在一九四九年八月十二日关于战俘的日内瓦公约上签字吗？这公约规定：一俟军事行动停止，除犯有刑事罪的战俘可予以扣留外，其余一律应予立即释放，遣送回家。难道这一公约没有规定交战国的双方政府甚至要找寻并保证遣归被俘的与散处全国的对方服役人员吗？难道美国政府不知道它曾签署的这一个公约吗？难道它已经忘记了这一个公约吗？美国政府是知道的，只是不想执行罢了，因为如果国际协定对它不利，一般说来，它就不惜撕毁一切国际协定。有人带着假装气愤的样子对我们说：“你们必须执行国际协定。”但是他们自己却不执行一个重要的国际协定，特别是他们既不执行他们曾在日内瓦签字的一九二九年关于战俘的公约，也不执行一九四九年的公约。
    那末，在朝鲜停止敌对行动的问题，现在决定于谁呢？
    这问题决定于那些提出荒谬、非法而不公正的要求，提出什么“一对一”交换俘虏等一类要求的人们！这种要求违背国际法和国际法的原则，违背以国际法和这些原则为基础的协定。
    各国人民坚决要求停止扩军  迫使美国战争集团感到恐慌
    美国政府打算把自己的罪过推到别人身上去，打算这样来掩饰自己拖延板门店谈判的阴谋。可是这种骗人的阴谋既然不能欺骗任何人，也不能说服任何人。这种阴谋的目的是对付美国广大阶层人民对于现在在朝鲜进行的战争的不满情绪，这种阴谋的目的是缓和美国的舆论——在美国，不满意这个战争赌博的情绪正在不断高涨。这种情绪的高涨也是自然的，因为除了比较少的一小集团人和那些靠他们口下余食生活的人们以外，赞成这个战争的人在美国现在已经不多了。美国一部分报纸的报道也证明：对于这个战争的不满情绪正在美国人民中间蔓延。据像《华尔街日报》这样消息灵通的报纸报道，从各自的选区回到华盛顿的一些国会议员们，都谈到了美国选民中间普遍存在的不满意这个战争的情绪。
    《华尔街日报》说：绝对大多数的选民显然在担心美国的外交政策，而且不了解这种政策的趋势。
    《华尔街日报》又说，连原来支持朝鲜战争的一些南方各州的国会议员们现在也承认：他们的选区的人民——据《华尔街日报》说——要求美国人立刻退出朝鲜。
    当然，同时也有被战争宣传、被战争狂和相似的措施煽动起来的相反的情绪，在某些人们中间高涨着。可是，上面所说的一些事实本身就说明了一切，而且这些事实也是值得考虑的；我说值得考虑，这话首先适用于大西洋集团国家的代表们，特别是这个集团的美国领袖们。
    法国代表知道自己的无能，知道使人们相信大西洋集团的爱好和平的性质以掩饰大西洋集团各国的扩张军备运动的种种勾当，已经不发生效力，因此就想转移人们的注意，扯到别的问题上去。
    譬如，他曾说，我们指责大西洋集团，我们说参加大西洋集团是和联合国会员国的资格不相容的，是因为苏联希望“使大西洋公约这样的协定陷于瘫痪”。
    可是，我们是用不着做任何事去使这个公约陷于瘫痪的，这个大西洋公约和大西洋集团，用不着我们出力，本身就在一天天地接近瘫痪，因为大西洋集团是有着内部矛盾的。这种矛盾，一天比一天暴露得更清楚了。在罗马、在巴黎，我们都看到了这种情形。最近，在华盛顿，在杜鲁门和邱吉尔的没有结果的会谈中，我们也看到了这种情形。在这个大西洋阵营中，并没有真正的和衷共济，也不可能有真正的和衷共济，因为在这个阵营中，一切都建筑在无情的竞争、互相控制的野心的上面，一切都建筑在强者发号施令、束缚弱者，而使弱者在经济和财政上变成附属者的政策上面。
    当然，无论什么“合作”、“社会”等等空话和花言巧语都不能掩饰这些矛盾，甚至不能阻止这些矛盾的发展。这一切欺人的话，唯一的目的就是要避免讨论我们关心的基本问题，要用空话来淹没这问题的讨论。
    因此，下述情形并不是偶然的。甚至一点也不打算支持或赞成苏联建议的报纸也不得不说，西方想阻止苏联的建议提出来公开讨论，并且——如一月十五日的“战斗报”所说——准备“提出许多空洞的法律上的说法来埋葬苏联的建议，而事实上这个建议无论如何是能当作摊牌讨论的基础的”。
    这一段话再一次证明了，大西洋集团中领导的国家，主要是美国，已经对人民的坚决要求感到恐慌了。各国人民、一切爱好和平国家的人民都坚决地要求停止扩张军备运动，停止存储原子弹；要求通过决议，规定禁止原子武器，建立严格的国际监督，规定这两个措施同时付诸实行；要求通过决议，规定真正裁减军备和武装部队，而不是像美、英、法三国所建议那样在纸面上装模作样地空谈裁减军备。
    对禁止原子武器建立国际监督  苏联提出了一整套有效的计划
    苏联代表团关于禁止原子武器和建立国际监督的重要建议被美、英、法三国和与它们同一个阵营的其他某些国家的代表轻轻一笔带过，那是并不足为奇的。这些先生们匆匆地想出种种“论点”和“理由”，总想怎样避免讨论我们的建议的实质。他们不敢公开这样做，于是便费尽心思找寻借口和托辞，事事吹毛求疵，明明没有什么毛病也要挑挑剔剔，并且还施展出他们全套外交上的鬼把戏，以掩饰一下他们拒绝支持我们的建议。这里我们可以看到外交欺诈的真榜样！
    巴西代表说我们耍手段。我不打算把巴西代表以及整个美英集团各国代表们在这里使用的方法叫做耍手段。他们在这里所做的一切都是欺诈，也可以叫做马戏班的吞剑戏法，这是并不需要什么技巧的，要想使这戏法成功只需要两个条件：手法迅速，观众轻信。在这种情况下，像巴西代表之类的代表是可以希望成功的。至于美国、英国和法国的提案，那完全有理由可以说，这个提案不折不扣地是在重大问题上的无耻欺诈！的确，美国、英国和法国的这个提案和我们的提案比起来，还有什么价值呢！
    这个提案的目的是要阻止联合国大会就禁止原子武器和建立国际监督通过建议，它的用意如何，也可从美国国务卿昨天在华盛顿发表的谈话中推测得出来。
    艾奇逊先生硬说，我们仍然试图使禁止原子武器限于“纸上空谈”，而在同意任何会使这个禁令付诸实行的有效的管制制度方面不提出任何保证。
    以前，他们告诉我们说，宣布禁止原子武器而不建立管制机构就是纸面上的禁止。现在他们却又说，禁止原子武器同时又建立国际监督也是纸面上的禁止。那末，怎样才算真正禁止原子武器呢？看来，大概是“规定、限制和均衡地裁减一切武装部队和一切军备”的提案中所规定的那一套了，谁都记得，在这个提案里，一个字也没有谈到禁止原子武器的事，而只是空洞地谈到管制机构的任务——制订关于使这个机构的活动可以导致禁止原子武器的建议。
    加拿大代表问我们是不是同意“国际管制与视察制度应当是长期的”。对于这个问题，我必须指出，既然这个问题是关于国际管制机构的，那末这样问就毫无意义了。问题很明白，在管制机构建立起来以后，因为没有说它是临时机构，每个懂事的人就应该了解它是长期的。至于视察方面，加拿大代表也谈了一些无意义的话，简直使人对他绝望了。大家看看，我们提案中的第六项第二点不是明白提到视察是长期的吗？但是，为什么加拿大和其他国家的代表在美、英、法三国提出它们的方案——它们现在承认三国的方案与我们的方案本质上是一致的——时，不向它们提出这些问题呢？我要来回答这个问题：因为那个时候你们不需要提出你们的问题来混水摸鱼。现在适当的时机来了。当然人们是必须找到适当的时机摸鱼的，特别是在混水中摸鱼。
    他们要想知道，“严格的国际监督”意思是怎样说的。我必须说明，我并不打算满足这些代表们的好奇心。我们这里不是学校，我们并不是小学生，你们也不是教师或者学监；像你们那样公然无耻地说——恕我用这样的字眼——你们认为无需在这里研究这问题，那么我并不打算向你们说明，不打算向你们解释某某问题的特别意义如何。我认为我们的代表团这样做是不合适的。
    如果我提到了这个问题，那只是要使一切真正关心真理的人能够自己辨别我们的建议意味着什么，你们的问题又意味着什么。
    他们问，“严格的国际监督”到底是什么意思。但是，我们已经屡次谈到了管制制度的意义，这是和“巴鲁区计划”完全不同的。
    早在一九五一年十月，苏联政府领袖斯大林在谈到美国关于禁止原子武器的“管制”计划的幕后真相时就已经指出：“美国的人物也谈‘管制’，但是他们的‘管制’不是从停止原子武器的生产出发，而是要继续这种生产，其数量按各个国家拥有原料的数量而定。所以，美国的‘管制’不是从禁止原子武器出发，而是要使这种武器成为法定的、合法的。因此，使战争贩子用原子武器来消灭成千成万和平居民的权利，成为合法的。不难了解，这不是管制，而是对管制的嘲笑，是对各国人民的和平愿望的欺骗。很明白，这种‘管制’是不能使各国要求禁止原子武器和停止原子武器生产的爱好和平的人民满意的。”
    至于苏联、至于我们主张建立有效的国际监督的建议又是怎样的呢？这建议包括一整套极端重要的措施。
    这便是：第一，视察一切生产原子原料和原子能的工厂，审查它们的账目；第二，检查现有的原子原料、供应品和半成品的存货；第三，进行必要的生产活动的研究，以便管制原子物资和原子能的使用；第四，监督履行关于技术管制——不是一般的管制而是技术管制——方面的已经确立的规则，而且还不仅是监督履行，还有对原子原料的加工企业及其他一切处理原子原料的企业规定技术管制规则的权利，这就是说，按照我们的建议，管制机构能对任何处理原子原料的企业规定它认为必要的技术规则；第五，管制机构有权搜集并整理关于提炼原子原料的情报；第六，有权搜集关于原子原料和原子能生产的情报；第七，除了普通的视察之外，如果发现有违犯禁止原子武器决定的嫌疑情形，得进行特别视察；此外还有其他等等。这难道还不够明白地说明我们关于国际监督的建议的提法完全是郑重其事的吗？这种提法，我深深相信，能够经得起一切正直和有良心的批评。但是，当然它是经不起没有良心的批评的，因为对于没有良心的行为是没有任何保证的。我们以前已经解释过这一切了。然而，他们还是把一切问题从头到尾地搬出来问我们，这显然是因为没有事情可干的缘故。那些提出这种问题的人往往是闲暇的时间太多了，不知道怎样消磨才好。于是，他们便坐下来，凭空想出这样的问题，要想和最机灵的人比一比高下。我们都看到，他们有很多时间干这方面的玩意。但是他们却没有充裕的时间去思考和研究一下他们提到的书籍。例如，海地代表就提到某一位“十八世纪的俄罗斯作家”李昂节夫，甚至还引用了他的话。可是，实际上李昂节夫并不是什么作家，而只是一位莫斯科的出版物检查员，虽然他的确也曾胡乱写过几部粗制滥造的小说。现在，他竟被海地代表形容为“斯拉夫扩张主义”的远祖。
    我愿意肯定地说，海地代表决没有读过李昂节夫所著的书，甚至见都没见过。他所使用的，仅仅是某一位甘愿为他服务的奸细所弄的窃改本。是有人愿意当这种奸细的，特别是在当奸细可以领到美元或英镑——当然不是海地币——的薪金的时候。
    加拿大代表是怎样的呢？加拿大代表希望表明自己是多么博学，表明自己甚至懂得马克思主义的科学，他说，有一本“小册子”，据他说叫做什么“进两步，退一步”。他所说的是伟大的思想家列宁的名著，叫做“进一步，退两步”，不是像加拿大代表所说的，叫做什么“进两步，退一步”。显然他根本没有读过这本书。大家必须承认，和这样的对手进行有礼貌的对话，是困难的。确是困难的。尽管我尽了一切力量有礼貌些，以符合那些不满意我的人们的口味，可是对这些人我还是无法圆通的，因为实际上他们的想法也太不知羞耻，太自以为是了，他们竟然认为他们能够支吾开任何事情。应该把他们以及他们的胡说八道和假“博学”向全世界揭露出来。
    美英法不愿真正禁止原子武器  只空口说一些无关紧要的问题
    我必须就葛罗斯先生的发言说几句话。我不能掩饰我对在这里所听到的一切感到惊讶。我不愿多谈这一点，因为，基本上说来，葛罗斯所谈的，我们已经讨论过了。可是有一点是值得指出的。他在结束发言的时候说，美国政府要向裁减军备委员会提出重要的提案。这是他说的。我早已准备耐心地等待美国政府的这种重要提案。可是，可惜得很，我终于失望了。
    我从艾奇逊先生昨天在华盛顿记者招待会上的谈话知道：他，艾奇逊，根本不知道，也没有听说这种据说是美国政府准备向裁减军备委员会提出的“重要提案”。
    也许是葛罗斯先生正在背着艾奇逊先生秘密准备这种“重要提案”吧。也许是他根本没有准备这种提案，仅仅是说一说，以求封锁苏联提出提案的道路吧。如果艾奇逊先生的话不错，那就证明葛罗斯手中并没有什么建议。那末，葛罗斯先生，你的上司驳倒你昨天的声明了。显然，葛罗斯所说的什么美国政府正在准备向裁减军备委员会提出重要提案的话，是别有用心的。
    美、英、法三国的代表们，正在设法把我们的提案转到裁减军备委员会去，不使大会审议这个提案。
    我的朋友、乌克兰代表团团长早已在这里说过，不久以前，这些代表们还拚命阻止把他们的提案提到裁减军备委员会去，而要求在这里，在政治委员会和大会中，审议他们的提案。可是，现在似乎他们又采取了完全不同的立场。当“三国”（美、英、法三国）需要那样作的时候，他们就要求在这里审议“三国”提案，并且提出理由说：“如果不附带指示，就不可以把提案提到委员会去。”现在我们说：在这里审议我们的提案吧。他们却又说了：“应该不附带指示，就把它提到委员会去。”
    可是，归根结底说，照这种办法，根本是不可能互相共事的。当对他们有利的时候，他们说的是一样，当对他们不利的时候，他们说的又是另外一样。这是南非霍腾托特人的伦理观念，这种伦理观念就是：别人偷我的老婆，有罪；我偷别人的老婆，好得很。
    跟遵照这种伦理观念的人是不可能达成协议的。三国代表都说，他们将投票反对在第一委员会和大会中讨论我们的提案，竭力设法把我们的提案提交十二国委员会“研究”。仅这一点就说明了可敬的三国代表的真正意图，他们对他们自己的提案使用一种尺度，对关于同一个问题的苏联的提案又使用另外一种尺度。不过，这不是伦理观念，这是手段，这是阴谋，巴黎有些报纸称之为“典型的拖延手段”。我要说，这不是典型的拖延手段，而是典型的阻挠我们的提案的手段；这不仅是拖延的手段，这也是迷惑舆论的手段。美、英、法三国代表不敢在舆论面前公然为他们的态度辩护，害怕舆论的谴责，便设法向人民隐瞒他们的态度，不惜歪曲事实，歪曲我们的立场。
    听到像劳埃德、葛罗斯、萧维尔这些人的发言，的确令人发笑。他们只空口说一说无关紧要的问题，却不说我们的提案发表清楚明确的意见。这一提案是清楚明确的。我们建议由联合国大会宣布禁止原子武器并建立国际管制机构，意思就是说，与实行这一禁令的同时，建立国际管制机构。批评我们的人只是以另一个问题来代替一个问题，一点本质的东西都没有谈到。他们只说：“提出这种提案，并不足以扫除障碍。”而对我们的提案的本质，却一句话不说，虽然我们的提案一定可以、而且事实上也扫除了这些障碍。只有一个障碍它没有扫除，而且也无法扫除，这个障碍就是鼓吹原子弹的先生们、大西洋集团的人物在任何条件下都完全不愿意真正禁止原子武器和建立真正的国际管制机构。在这个问题上这些大人先生们全线撤退了，把他们在这个第一委员会讨论裁减军备和武装部队问题时说过的话全都忘光了。
    的确，在那个时候，他们拚命地想证明，没有建立国际监督或者在关于建立国际监督的公约还没有缔订之前，就由联合国大会宣布禁止原子武器，是不能接受的。一九五一年十二月三日，法国代表莫克说：“苏联关于禁止原子武器的建议剥夺了法国在目前紧张形势中的保障。”他又说：“假如法国有原子弹的话，法国对于销毁原子弹的问题，也主张只有它确知其他国家也在同时销毁原子弹时，它才会同意自己也这样做。”
    然而，他说，如果苏联坚持在没有建立任何管制办法之前，就禁止原子武器，那是没有什么成功的希望的。他接着又说，然而他相信，双方妥协是可能的，双方能在宣布禁止原子武器和建立国际监督两个阶段上取得协议。他认为，一旦通过了折衷的决议，便能早日停止原子武器的生产。
    可是就在那次会议上，莫克自己反驳了自己的话！（附带说一下，莫克现在不敢在这里说话了，显然是免得陷于难堪的境地。）他当时说：“苏联主张首先禁止原子武器和停止原子武器生产然后再实行监督的建议，必须在出席小组委员会的四个国家之间有了一种完全互相信任的气氛以后，才能够接受。而现在却没有这种气氛，因此为了取得协议起见，必需苏联不再坚持这个条件。”
    现在，谁都可以看到，我们不再坚持这种条件了。谁都可以看到，我们在一月十二日提交第一委员会审议的提案中，提出了禁止原子武器和建立国际监督两者同时实行的原则。
    十二月六日，同一个莫克又谈到“为解决同时实行的问题求得共同基础”的可能性。他说，就宣布禁止原子武器取得协议是可能的，这禁令可以在建立国际监督之后实行。这便是法国代表当时的说法。
    而现在我们听到怎样一种说法呢？现在我们听到的和法国代表以前所说的完全不一样。那么发生了些什么事情呢？起先，有一位所谓法国代表来了，发表了一通议论。他说完后便走了。跟着另外一位所谓法国代表来接替了他的位置，发表了一通跟第一个人完全不同的议论。这人说完之后，不幸却没有退下去；实际上他并没有必要退下去，因为他并没有自相矛盾，而他的话和先前一个同样代表他的政府的人所说的话相矛盾，是完全无所谓的。尤其是因为这个政府已经不再存在，所以就更加无所谓了。这里，我们就好像看人家变戏法一样：一个人上来，说了些话，退下去了。接着另外一个人上来，说了些恰恰相反的话，然而这人却面不改容，还在等着看他这样做产生了些什么反应。而这两个人都说：我们是法国政府的代表，而且不仅代表法国政府，还代表美国和英国政府。我刚刚对这表示怀疑，马上就有某一位大西洋集团国家的人说：“你们怎能怀疑呢，他是人民的代表呀！”
    但是，我们都知道，这些代表都是由有种种限制的选举中产生的，都是由于选举舞弊而产生的。他们会是怎样的人民代表简直是可想而知了。诸位可从许多地方，例如美国社会学家布里斯的名著“美国民主”中知道这种情形。从这本书里，诸位可以看到，在所谓“民主”国家里，那些企图成为“人民代表”的人是怎样活动的。
    我们这个委员会里的美利坚合众国代表也已经调换过了。先是一个代表，现在是另外一个。的确，在需要否认他以前所采取的立场时，他并没有离开这里。但是，因为没有勇气公开改变他的立场，他现在就以伪装的形式来试图这样做，但是做得很笨拙。可以说：所有这些伪装都是太单薄了一点。
    苏联主张监督与禁止同时生效美英法却在阻挠禁止原子武器
    但是，这不是现在要谈的问题。现在要谈的问题是：他们——美利坚合众国、英国和法国的代表——都按照一个计划来共同行事，每个人在这里不仅代表他的本国，而且还代表所有三个国家。他们从前采取一个立场，抱着一个目标：“没有国际监督，就不可能禁止原子武器。”“必须建立国际监督，否则，禁止原子武器就将成为一纸空文，只可能成为幻想而已。”他们异口同声地这样喊着。
    他们说：“先监督，后禁止。”他们认为：我们为“先禁止，后监督”的方案进行辩护，是我们主张的主要缺点。
    现在，我们来努力一下，并不介意别人将会告诉我们说我们曾在一九四八年和一九四九年提出过提案——我们将不因此而仓皇失措，当然，如果我们的提案是好的，重复这个提案是没有罪的。我们现在提出另一个方案，这个方案建议：联合国大会必须宣布无条件地禁止原子武器和建立国际监督，并规定第一步和第二步必须同时实施。这样可以看出，我们目前提出的提案决不只是重复我们在一九四八年和一九四九年所提出的东西。在一九四八年，我们没有提出过同时实行禁止原子武器和国际监督的提案。在一九四九年，我们曾经建议草拟禁止原子武器和管制原子能的两个公约。现在，我现在提出的建议是：联合国大会立即宣布无条件地禁止原子武器，规定禁止原子武器将与建立国际监督同时生效。
    但是，现在虽然我们建议：“禁止与监督将同时生效，将同时付诸实施”，可是没有人对我们说：“好，我们接受”，也没有人对我们说：“这样不好，我们拒绝接受”，但是却有人问我们：“‘生效’是什么意思？”
    但是，每个人都应该明白：“将生效”就是说：它们将开始实行。
    如果诸位注意的话，你们就会发现：他们因为现在已经了解他们将不能坚持原来的意见，所以他们现在提出新的意见。他们阵营里的一个代表昨天已经说过：只有在能够证明国际管制制度已经在有效地实行时，才可能禁止原子武器。
    要了解这是什么意思，难道是困难的事吗？难道不可以明白地看出：其中已经留下回旋的余地，以便将来好说：“不，虽然有监督，虽然它已实施，但是没有效力。”
    这就是这个关于监督的“效力”的“小小修正案”的意义！我们将同意——并且这个修正案正应当这样来了解：在建立监督的同时禁止原子武器，但是在这里，你们必须同意在事先承认监督是会发生效力的。
    谈到这里，应该指出的是：一九四九年美国驻原子能委员会代表奥斯邦先生曾说：不可能有一般的有效监督。
    可是这种关于有效监督的“修正案”，只能有一个目的，就是：把禁止原子武器的问题，淹没在关于有效监督的空谈中。
    起初他们对我们说：“你们是主张先禁止原子武器，后实行监督吗？”现在我们说：“禁止和监督应该同时实行。”他们不再就这种建议来答复我们了，却又来问许多问题，而且又不愿意讨论这些问题，只是谈到监督的“效力”，把这个当作执行禁止原子武器的禁令的新条件。这一切只有一个目的：使禁止原子武器不能实现；使在禁止原子武器问题上达成协议成为完全不可能。美英集团不久以前所通过的三国提案，也反映了这一点。这个提案根本就不主张禁止原子武器。
    美英法进行阻挠的卑鄙目的是企图更自由地积存原子弹
    在这以前，美国代表耶塞普在谈到我们所提出的主张由大会宣布无条件禁止原子武器并建立国际监督的提案的时候说：规定国家不生产新的原子弹、不使用现有的原子弹那种单纯而没有根据的声明，是不能要求任何人予以相信的。
    他说，在关于原子武器生产和制造原子弹所用的原料的存储的国际管制制度实施以前，禁止原子武器的声明只会是纸上的禁令；他又说，只有当那种制度实施以后，禁令才能付诸实行，监督才能执行。
    所有这三个人——美、英、法三国的代表——都顽固地要造成一种情况，在那种情况下面，禁止原子武器的禁令要和国际监督结合起来，而且，照耶塞普说，这种禁令，要由国际监督，而不是由“单单一个声明”具体地表现出来——这样的声明，在他们看来，如果没有国际监督作基础，就是虚幻的。现在每一个人都看到，一月十二日提交第一委员会的苏联提案提供了解决办法，这种解决办法是不能用所谓宣布无条件禁止原子武器只是一句空话这样的理由来加以批评的。为了破坏我们要求联合国大会宣布禁止原子武器的提案，他们对我们说，既然建议禁止原子武器和国际监督同时实施，便没有必要作这种宣布了。这样的推理是毫无根据的。毫无疑问，哪怕就是联合国大会只宣布一下无条件禁止原子武器，也会产生巨大的有利的精神影响，也会引起有利于缓和国际紧张局势和消除另一次世界大战威胁的努力的重大的政治后果。联合国大会这样宣布，就会使被反动的侵略宣传迷住的人们清醒起来，就会对他们的心灵发生医疗的效果。如果联合国大会宣布禁止原子武器、从而谴责一切鼓吹原子武器的宣传，就一定不会发生像今天一家法国报纸所报道的那种令人难以置信的事实。我指的是巴黎一家大商店“市政厅市场”出售“原子弹轰炸”玩具，并附有广告说明书，它逐句译出来是这样：“儿童杂志谈到原子弹推翻步枪和大炮的王位的故事。这个游戏的情形也是这样。现在这个新游戏说明原子弹的行动是依靠轰炸目标的重要性而定，而轰炸目标则用数目字按照它们的军事价值予以标明。”
    说明书附有地图，标明“轰炸目标”。他们开始使儿童堕落，培养儿童对原子武器的兴趣，用原子心理的毒药毒害他们的心灵。这难道不是所谓“欧洲文化”、欧洲“文明”堕落下去的最后阶段吗？这是学习美国的样子、学习“美国生活方式”的结果。对于法国来说，这只是开始。不过，这种性质的事实在美国也不例外，在美国，战争宣传、特别是原子战争宣传已经达到了惊人的规模，而且采取了像美国“柯里尔”杂志的那些野蛮人的荒唐表现方式，尽管美国代表一九四七年曾在联合国投票赞成不准许进行战争宣传。
    正是因为这样，所以我们说：必须立即禁止原子武器，以联合国大会的名义宣布这个禁令。这样宣布禁止原子武器绝不会留下任何漏洞，因为它规定了禁止原子武器应与建立监督同时实施，所以这个禁令是否得到严格的执行是完全可以随时检查的。
    因此，拒绝支持我们的建议，是特别有害和危险的。然而，这种拒绝也不是我们意料之外的。
    谁都可以记得，我们老早就预见到这种情况。我们曾经指出，在这问题上西方国家与苏联的一切意见分歧归结起来都是由于一个原因，那就是美国在英国和法国的支持下，一贯顽固地希望阻止在原子武器问题上取得协议，以便它们能自由地积存起更多的原子弹，它们心里盘算着总有一天它们对苏联和其他爱好和平的人民用得着这些东西的。
    它们在这里提到所谓“规定、限制和均衡地裁减一切武装部队和一切军备”的决议（文件甲二○二五号）。然而，从这个决议的文字中可以看到，而且裁减军备委员会未来的工作无疑也将证明，这个决议完全没有为禁止原子武器问题提供任何解决办法。因此，苏联关于联合国大会必须宣布禁止原子武器和建立监督的建议仍然和以前一样有力量。
    然而，在这方面却碰到了美国、英国和法国代表制造的障碍。他们说，鉴于目前国际关系中存在着互不信任的情形，单是由联合国大会宣布禁止原子武器，是不能有什么很好的效果的。他们说，单纯的诺言、宣言和保证是没有用的，需要的是分量更重、意义更重大的东西。需要的是行动。这行动便是监督，这样才可能看得出诺言和宣言到底有多少诚意，到底这些诺言和宣言是否诚实严格地得到遵守。
    我们已经表明了我们愿意消除这种障碍。有一些国家，即使在联合国大会宣布禁止原子武器之后，当其他国家、其他对联合国大会的决定采取诚实态度的国家严格遵守这个决议并真正停止继续制造原子武器之后，仍然要无视其他国家的诚意，仍然要继续制造原子武器。我们现在要造成一种情况，以使宣布禁止原子武器不致为这些国家留下漏洞。苏联提案的条件恰恰可以完全达到这个目的。至于国际监督的问题，我愿提请委员会注意这提案的第三项和第六项，这两项谈到建立长期的国际监督问题。“长期”这种提法，三国在它们的“规定、限制和均衡地裁减一切武装部队和一切军备”提案中也曾提出过。
    劳埃德和耶塞普屡次说，如果在我们的提案中，加上“长期”两个字，就明确了，而且据劳埃德先生说，如果是这样，他就会认为提案中的这一项，与原来的三国提案中的第二、三两项大致相同了。耶塞普也有过同样的话，他说：有效的调查，本身就必须是继续不断的调查。他甚至又说，唯一可能的办法，就是继续不断的调查。他这话曾经说过许多次，曾经用各种不同的言语表明了他的基本观念，这种基本观念就是：关于原子能的监督，应该是继续不断的。劳埃德一九五一年十二月十一日在第一委员会发言的时候说，我们关于禁止原子武器和建立国际监督的问题的主张，是分阶段的，第一阶段是由大会决定禁止原子武器并建立国际监督，第二阶段是制订国际管制制度，第三阶段是建立管制机构。（附带提一下，这种分析是不对的。）劳埃德说，这样的办法是不能接受的，因为如果不施行监督，就会发生这样一种情况，就是：停止生产原子弹和使用原子武器的事情，完全决定于个别政府的诺言了。
    必须郑重地对待上面所说的苏联提案，必须正确地估计这个提案，不要顽固地坚持你们自己的主张。你们自己的主张是无法被接受的，因为你们的主张是绝对不足取的。
    如果美、英、法三国的代表继续这样顽固，硬要坚持自己的“先监督，后禁止”原子武器的主张，同时继续顽固地主张根据巴鲁区计划施行监督，那末，无疑地，在禁止原子武器和为了监督这种禁令的执行而成立管制机构的问题上，就要因这种主张而完全不可能真正达到协议了。
    他们主张根据巴鲁区计划建立国际管制制度，他们这样做，就已经使那些争取尽可能达成协议的工作注定要徒劳无效了。如果要达成协议，美、英、法三国的代表首先就必须放弃他们对于别国提案的歧视态度——特别是当这种提案是一种主张同时执行禁止原子武器的禁令并建立国际监督的提案的时候，他们就更加歧视。洞是要从两头开凿的。双方都必须努力，如果不这样，就无法达成协议了。我们不是仅仅这样说说了事，我们也照样做了。
    当然，不可能把劳埃德先生的发言放过不谈。他的发言，是特别要掩饰明白无疑的拒绝苏联提案的态度的，英国政府的态度就正是这种态度。劳埃德在这样做的时候，设法含糊其词，不说一句明确的话，可是就是这种态度，已清楚地透露了对于苏联提案的明确的否定态度。他从头到尾，说了一些表示各种怀疑的话，他不仅对表现苏联提案的基本问题的个别词句表示怀疑，而且对苏联的整个提案表示怀疑。可是问题根本不在某些个别字眼的意义上，问题在于——这也许是劳埃德自己料想不到的罢——我们所提出的规定同时实行禁止原子武器的禁令并建立国际监督的提案，是不利于英国的政策的。劳埃德自己也不得不承认这点。
    劳埃德事事吹毛求疵。在小组委员会一九五一年十二月五日的会议上，劳埃德指责我们，说我们就监督问题对三国提案的修正案省去了“长期”两个字，并想叫我们同意添进这两个字。他不惮烦地解释说，他不赞成“永久”这样一个字眼，而主张用“长期”这字眼，因为这一个字规定了经常的制度和程序，使得任何时候都可以进行视察。谁都很清楚，我们的建议一再提到“长期”这两个字，这建议已是无须再多加解释的了，最低限度是无须对劳埃德多加解释的了，因为当他在小组委员会里为这种提法辩护时，他显然是完全明白这种提法的意义的。而现在又怎样呢？现在他在这方面也发现了一大堆问题，一大堆疑问。他问道：这样的机构是否仅能对所谓已经报告的军火工厂行使监督权力呢？视察机构将设在什么地方呢？照他说，其他还有许多同一类的问题。
    劳埃德突然觉得这一切问题非常严重，好像没有其他办法可想，只好把我们的建议提交十二国委员会慎重研究了。可是这些幼稚的论点能迷惑得了谁呢？然而，现在最使劳埃德感到忧虑的似乎是我们关于长期进行视察时“无权非法干涉他国内政”的提法。他感觉到这是“不愉快的时刻”，这是令他感到忧虑的原因。人们是可以了解英国代表因我们关于不许干涉他国内政的建议而感到的不安的。对于那些历来在外国领土上横行霸道、摆起主人架子的人，对于那些帝国主义先生们，这个建议当然会像劳埃德先生所说那样，是“不愉快的时刻”。帝国主义阵营各国代表对我们的建议的反应表明了这个建议是如何重要。
    这个提法里关于不得干涉他国内政的问题，规定得丝毫没有一点含糊，这是非常显而易见的，因为这个提法完全符合联合国最重要的一条原则，亦即宪章第二条第七款里所规定的原则：“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件……。”
    但是，也许宪章的这一款对劳埃德先生还不够明白，也许还要再加以某种解释吧。
    爱好和平国家执行苏联和平计划就可以保证消除另一次大战威胁
    我已经总结了委员会四天来说“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施”这项议程进行讨论的结果。由此我不得不认为，各国代表在这方面提出种种论点，从各方面、在各种程度上批评我们的建议，用意无非都是拒绝禁止原子武器；因为这些论点不仅要使禁止原子武器取决于国际管制机构的建立（这个问题已获得解决，至少在我们方面是可以这样说的），而且也要使它取决于这个管制机构的效力（这是我已经谈过的），这当然就等于说，他们不愿在禁止原子武器的问题上达成协议。
    苏联代表团一月十二日提案中所提出来的建议，是解决关于消除另一次战争的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施的种种问题的一个重要而严肃的步骤。因为这个缘故，我们才坚持我们的八项建议。
    我们坚决主张，应该认为参加大西洋集团是和联合国机构会员国的资格不相容的。我们要求大会认为必须立即停止在朝鲜的敌对行动，并为达到这个目的，采取我们的提案中所规定的措施。我们坚决主张由大会宣布无条件禁止原子武器并建立国际管制机构，并且规定同时执行这种禁令和这种监督。我们主张由大会向安全理事会五个常任理事国建议，在一年内将它们各自的军备和武装部队裁减三分之一。
    我们主张由大会提出这样的建议，就是在采取了禁止原子武器和裁减三分之一武装部队的决定以后，所有国家都必须提出关于各自的军备和武装部队——包括原子武器在内——的情况的完全而可靠的情报以及关于在外国领土的军事基地的情报。我们建议在安全理事会下，根据长期进行视察的原则建立国际管制机构。我们建议召开世界会议，讨论裁减军备的问题。我们建议由大会建议五大国政府缔结和平公约，并建议所有爱好和平的国家参加这个公约。有人对我们说：五大国和平公约是不必要的，因为现在已经有了六十国公约——联合国宪章了。可是，如果已经有了六十国公约，为什么还必须要大西洋公约呢？为什么还必须要欧洲集团呢？为什么还必须要泛美公约呢？如果已经有了以我们的宪章为形式的六十国公约，为什么还必须要许许多多的各种双边条约和多边条约呢？
    显然，这种反对意见纯粹是一种借口，目的是使这种极其重要的公约（这个公约是力能维持和平的五大国的协议）不能缔结。我们现在还是坚决主张缔结这种公约的。
    我们深信：我刚才概述了的、而且在我们的提案中所表现的这种真正的和平计划如果获得通过，这个计划的各项如果被一切爱好和平的国家贯彻始终地执行了，那末，就的确可以保证消除另一次世界大战的威胁，并巩固国际和平与友好。
