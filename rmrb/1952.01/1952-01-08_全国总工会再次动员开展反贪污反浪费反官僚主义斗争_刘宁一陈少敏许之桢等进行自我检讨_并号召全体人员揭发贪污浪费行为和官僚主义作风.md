The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Re-Mobilizes to Launch the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Struggle
Liu Ningyi, Chen Shaomin, Xu Zhizhen, and Others Conduct Self-Criticisms
And Call on All Personnel to Expose Acts of Corruption and Waste and Bureaucratic Styles
    The directly affiliated organizations of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, taking advantage of the New Year's gathering of cadres at 2 PM on New Year's Day, once again mobilized for the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle. Vice-Chairman Liu Ningyi further explained the great significance of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy to the cadres present, then examined his own extravagant and wasteful behavior and bureaucratic style, and called on all personnel to bravely expose the acts of corruption and waste and bureaucratic styles within the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
    Vice-Chairman Liu Ningyi once again reminded everyone that corruption, waste, and bureaucracy within the trade union system are very serious, especially due to the erosion of bourgeois ideology in their work, which has manifested in non-working-class consciousness everywhere, the situation being particularly severe. He used the directly affiliated organizations of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions as an example. He said: The responsibility of trade union workers is to organize and lead the masses of workers to rapidly restore production and struggle against phenomena that damage national property, and to improve the lives of the entire nation. However, when our All-China Federation of Trade Unions entered the city, we did not first consider how to improve factories and rapidly restore production; instead, we concentrated on establishing large organizations, competing for good houses, and competing for vehicles and furniture. The past style of enduring hardship and hard work has not been maintained; on the contrary, we are comparing ourselves with others in terms of enjoyment and treatment.
    Vice-Chairman Liu Ningyi then examined the extravagance, waste, and bureaucracy he personally displayed in his work. He used three things to illustrate the problem:
    First, there is serious extravagance and waste in the trade union system's foreign activities. He said: Going abroad is originally a very serious matter. It is about bringing the experience of the Chinese working class's struggle to foreign countries and introducing the experience of the foreign working class's struggle to China. Before going abroad, we focused on preparing clothes, bags, leather shoes, and the like; saying that we should "pay attention to etiquette," we thought of everything, even checking whether the clothes were made of Chinese or British wool, but we didn't fully prepare the work report. This kind of putting the cart before the horse, impractical style is a reflection of non-working-class thought.
    Secondly, there is also extravagance and waste in the reception of foreign guests. He said: Last October, representatives from sixteen countries came to China. These representatives came to China to see the construction of New China, to see the great patriotic enthusiasm and internationalist spirit shown by the people of New China under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and to see the great Chairman Mao. However, influenced by bourgeois ideology, we considered the original plain clothing as "harmful to the national image" and spent a lot of money to make clothing. According to preliminary checks, the waste is about 80 million yuan. There are other wastes as well.
    Again, it is the bureaucracy in budget review. He said: I have never seriously and strictly reviewed the budgets that I signed off on; I always signed as usual. Corruption and waste can thus be legalized.
    Finally, he called on all personnel of the organization to speak freely and fearlessly expose all acts of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy within the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and to deeply launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.
    Chen Shaomin, Chairman of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union, then spoke. She said: Although we have already mobilized for the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, because the leading cadres have not yet moved, the movement has not been fully launched. She then conducted a self-criticism. In addition to examining some of her own wasteful behaviors and bureaucratic styles in her personal life, she focused on examining how she represented the non-working-class emotions of some trade union cadres.
    She said: I have always paid attention to a hard-working and simple life, but after entering the city, problems arose. I often thought: The government has already promulgated the Trade Union Law, which was signed by Chairman Mao, and governments at all levels should find houses for the trade unions; if someone has not found a house for the trade union, I will ask him to examine "whether he has working-class thinking." I remember last spring, the Textile Workers' Union wrote a letter to Premier Zhou to solve the housing problem, asking me to sign it. Not only did I agree, but I also added two sentences. Usually, when I heard some trade union cadres complain and say strange things, calling trade union cadres "fourth-class cadres," I did not correct them; instead, I agreed with their incorrect opinions. Our trade union cadres do not strive to achieve results in production but instead create a "fourth-class cadre" title for themselves, using this to show that their enjoyment is not as good as others. This is comparing themselves with others; and this comparison is not with farmers or workers but with the life of the bourgeoisie, thinking that the working class should be special and climb on top of others. Treating the Party and the government with this attitude is completely unacceptable, and if it is not corrected, the future is very dangerous.
    In his speech, Xu Zhizhen, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, also focused on examining how he had accepted the erosion of bourgeois ideology. He examined how he had painstakingly strived for houses and cars and arranged for organizations since entering the city, thinking that those cadres with longer arms who could grab a handful were "capable," and secretly thinking that those more honest comrades were "useless." He also exposed that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions had a corrupt practice of "using small public funds to cover up large public funds." That was during the National Trade Union Work Conference convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in 1949. At that time, due to price fluctuations, a budget was made, and it was immediately converted into physical goods. After the meeting was over, in addition to the expenses of the meeting, a portion of the funds was returned to the Ministry of Finance; the remaining 1,100 bags of flour and more than 40,000 jin of rice became the private property of the organization.
    Secretary-General Xu Zhizhen stated: He is in charge of finance, and the departments he manages should become the focus of everyone's exposure and reporting. He hopes that all personnel will use all means to boldly put forward opinions and fully launch this movement.
    Finally, Vice-Chairman Liu Ningyi announced that this self-criticism is only preliminary. In the future, responsible comrades will more systematically and deeply lead all working comrades to conduct self-criticism and boldly expose these non-working-class thoughts and the wrong behaviors of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, especially corrupt behaviors.

### 全国总工会再次动员开展反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争  刘宁一陈少敏许之桢等进行自我检讨  并号召全体人员揭发贪污浪费行为和官僚主义作风

    全国总工会再次动员开展反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争
    刘宁一陈少敏许之桢等进行自我检讨
    并号召全体人员揭发贪污浪费行为和官僚主义作风
    中华全国总工会直属机关，在元旦下午二时，利用干部新年团拜的机会，再次进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的动员。刘宁一副主席向到会干部进一步说明反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的重大意义后，检讨了自己的铺张浪费行为和官僚主义作风，号召全体人员勇敢地揭发全国总工会机关内部的贪污浪费行为和官僚主义作风。
    刘宁一副主席再一次提醒大家，要认识工会系统中贪污、浪费和官僚主义是很严重的，特别是在工作中受了资产阶级思想的侵蚀，处处表现了一些非工人阶级的意识，情形尤为严重。他以全国总工会直属机关为例。他说：工会工作者的责任是组织和领导工人群众，迅速恢复生产，和破坏国家资财的现象作斗争，把整个国家人民的生活搞好。但是我们全国总工会一进城来，不是先考虑怎样把工厂搞好，使生产迅速恢复；而是把精神集中到安大机关、争好房子、争车辆和家具等方面去了。过去吃苦耐劳的作风没有坚持下来，反而和别人比享受比待遇。
    刘宁一副主席继即检讨他个人工作中所表现出来的铺张浪费和官僚主义。他就三件事情来说明问题：
    第一，工会系统的出国活动中有严重的铺张浪费行为。他说：出国本来是一件非常严肃的事，这是要把中国工人阶级斗争的经验带到外国去，把外国工人阶级斗争的经验介绍到中国来。而我们出国之先，着重准备的是衣服、皮包、皮鞋之类；说是要
    “注意礼貌”，什么都想到了，连衣服是中国呢料还是英国呢料都检查了，但偏偏工作报告却没完全准备好。这种舍本逐末、不务实际的作风，正是非工人阶级思想的反映。
    其次，接待外宾中也有铺张浪费之处。他说：去年十月，十六个国家的代表到中国来。这些代表来到中国，原是要看一看新中国的建设，看一看新中国人民在毛主席领导下所表现的伟大爱国热忱和国际主义精神，看一看伟大的毛主席。但我们受了资产阶级思想的影响，以原来的朴素的服装为“有伤国体”，花了不少钱去制服装。据初步检查浪费约八千多万元。其他的浪费也有。
    再次，是预算审核中的官僚主义。他说：经过我签字的预算，自己从没有认真严格地审核过，总是照例签字。贪污、浪费，可以由此取得合法。
    最后，他号召机关的全体人员有话便讲，毫无顾忌地揭发全国总工会机关中一切贪污、浪费行为和官僚主义作风，把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动深入发动起来。
    纺织工会全国委员会主席陈少敏继起讲话。她说：关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，虽然我们已经作过动员，但因为领导干部还没有动起来，所以运动也就没有能全面展开。她接着进行了自我检讨。她除了检讨个人生活方面的某些浪费行为和官僚主义作风外，着重检讨了自己怎样代表了一些工会干部的非工人阶级的情绪。
    她说：我一向是注意到生活的艰苦朴素的，但进城以后，毛病就出现了。我常常以为：政府已经公布了工会法，这是毛主席签了字的，各级政府就应当替工会找房子；有人没给工会找房子，我就要他检查“有没有工人阶级思想”。记得去年春天，纺织工会为解决房子问题，写信给周总理，要我签字，我不仅同意，而且加上两句。平常听到一些工会干部发牢骚、说怪话，自称工会干部是“四等干部”。我没有去纠正他们，反而同意他们的不正确意见。我们工会干部不在生产上争取搞出成绩来，却要自己替自己取一个“四等干部”的名称，借此来表示自己的享受不如别人，这就是要和别人来比；而这种比，不是和农民比，不是和工人比，却是和资产阶级的生活来比，认为工人阶级应当特殊，要爬到别人头上去。用这种态度来对待党和政府，这是完全要不得的，如果不纠正，前途是很危险的。
    全国总工会秘书长许之桢讲话中，也着重检讨了自己怎样接受了资产阶级思想的侵蚀。他检讨了自己进城以来怎样处心积虑争房子、争汽车、安置机关，对于那些手臂长些能够伸手抓一把的干部认为“有办法”，对于那些老实一点的同志，暗地里觉得他们“没用”，他并揭发了全国总工会机关有过“小公套大公”的贪污行为。那是一九四九年全国总工会召开全国工会工作会议时的事情。当时，由于物价波动，作了预算后，便立刻买成实物。等到会议开完，除了会议的开支，并退了财政部一部分款子；余下的一千一百袋面粉，四万多斤大米，都成为机关的私产了。
    许之桢秘书长表示：自己是掌管财务的，自己掌握的工作部门应当成为大家揭发检举的重点。他希望全体人员，采用一切方式，大胆地提出意见，把这个运动充分地发动起来。
    最后，刘宁一副主席宣布，这次检讨，还只是初步，今后各负责同志将更为系统地和深刻地去认真领导全体工作同志进行自我检讨，并大胆地揭发这些非工人阶级的思想和贪污、浪费、官僚主义的错误行为，特别是贪污行为。（原载一月三日工人日报）
