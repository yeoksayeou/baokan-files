　　Saluting the Heroic Sons and Daughters of the Motherland and the Heroic Friends of Korea

　　Yan Jinde and the Glorious Achievements of the Third Battalion
　　Comrade Yan Jinde was the deputy political instructor of the Third Battalion of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army. During the Fifth Campaign, the Third Battalion broke through seven enemy blockades, advanced 120 li, wedged into the enemy's heartland, and victoriously occupied Daofeng Mountain, earning the glorious title of "Daofeng Mountain Battalion." In the counterattack at Gaowang Mountain, which crushed the enemy's "Autumn Offensive," the entire battalion was awarded the glorious banner of "First Class Merit at Gaowang Mountain."
　　Here, we only describe the glorious achievements of Yan Jinde and the Third Battalion in the battle to attack Gaowang Mountain. On November 23rd of last year, the Third Battalion accepted the task of attacking Gaowang Mountain. Gaowang Mountain was the commanding height on the west bank of the Imjin River, defended by a reinforced company of the enemy. The battle began, and the enemy continuously bombarded with seven or eight artillery groups and seven or eight tanks, sealing off a 300-meter open area, but this did not stop the Third Battalion from advancing. Our powerful artillery exerted great power, overwhelming the enemy's artillery fire, and covering the infantry to cross the blockade line in eight minutes. One company attacked the enemy's main position from the front. Soldier Yang Guishan took on the task of blasting barbed wire and removing obstacles for the charge. He closely followed the artillery fire, advancing step by step, using signals to direct the artillery to bombard the depth of the enemy's position. The enemy's barbed wire was flattened, and the bunkers were destroyed. At this time, the entire company shouted "Charge," and quickly occupied the first hilltop. Another company attacked from the left flank, and repelled three enemy counterattacks in succession. Deng Tianfu, a soldier of the Second Squad, showed even more heroic tenacity in the battle. He fired with one hand and threw grenades with the other, repelling an enemy platoon's counterattack, and then quickly broke through the enemy's front line. Then, the entire company took advantage of the victory to rush up the mountain, annihilating more than 200 enemies, and planted the victorious red flag on Gaowang Mountain.

　　Huang Jinming, the Hero Who Occupied Dahe Island
　　One winter night last year, on the west coast of northern Korea, the seawater was churning with waves. At this time, Huang Jinming, the deputy company commander of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, looked at the hour hand on his watch, which had pointed to the departure time. He immediately led all the soldiers of the company and boarded the first boat, heading towards Dahe Island in the vast darkness. Dahe Island is opposite the Tieshan Peninsula. More than 400 Rhee Syngman puppet soldiers lived on the island, directly threatening Andong, our country’s border city.
　　When the boat was 500 meters from Dahe Island, Huang Jinming ordered the gunners to start bombarding the island. Afterwards, he went into the cabin and tightly grasped the hand of boatman Zhang Yongqing, saying, "For the motherland, for the Korean people..." Zhang Yongqing fully understood his meaning and firmly replied, "Company commander, please rest assured that I will definitely complete the task assigned to me by the people of the motherland." The boat was at full power, rushing forward like an arrow. When 150 meters from the shore, the fierce battle began. The bow of the first boat had a hole the size of a basin. The soldiers plugged it with life jackets and continued to shoot while standing on them. As the boat was about to land, the enemy concentrated all its firepower, sealing off the landing site, and the sea and the shore became a sea of fire. Huang Jinming stood on the bow of the boat and shouted, "Comrades, the time has come to perform meritorious service for the motherland. Landing means victory!" The soldiers jumped into the icy seawater one after another, braving dense gunfire to climb ashore and break through the enemy's beachhead positions. Squad Leader Qu Kaifu of the Ninth Squad was seriously injured. He immediately ordered his group leader, Wang Fengqiang, "Don't worry about me, quickly lead the entire squad to pursue the enemy." Wang Fengqiang stamped his foot and led all the soldiers of the squad to quickly occupy Height 202. At this time, the brother units also successfully landed from the flank, echoing each other from the left and right, completely surrounding the enemy on Dahe Island.
　　The battle ended quickly, and all 400 enemies were captured, none escaped.

　　"Ten Thousand Li Driver" Bian Junhui
　　One night during the Third Campaign in Korea, the moon hung high in the sky. Bian Junhui, a driver of a certain automobile company of the Volunteer Army, was driving a GAZ truck, transporting the motherland's comfort goods to the front line of the Han River. When the car drove near Sinxi, the highway had been blocked by enemy planes. Flares were thrown down continuously, illuminating the snow-covered highway particularly brightly. Two black shadows were speeding forward on the snowy road. The enemy spotted the target. Three bombs suddenly exploded two or three meters away from the car. Immediately afterwards, the enemy plane fired a burst of bullets. Comrade Bian Junhui thought: "The car is the property of the people of the motherland, and the comfort goods are the blood and sweat of the people of the motherland, so they cannot be abandoned!" So, he sped up and, taking advantage of the enemy plane's circling, rushed through the blockade line by the light of the flare. When the comfort goods were delivered to the front-line position, it was just in time for the Spring Festival. The soldiers ate pork dumplings sent by the motherland and proudly said, "This is something sent by the motherland, so we must fight well to answer the motherland's regards."
　　Last spring, the snow in Korea was melting, and the ice on the Imjin River was just thawing, with ice floes colliding with each other and rushing downstream. The river tide rose at night, and it was a pitch-black night. Bian Junhui drove a carload of fried noodles to the Imjin River. The bridge had been destroyed by enemy planes. When he thought that the soldiers fighting at the front were waiting to eat fried noodles, he disregarded everything and drove the car into the heart of the river. At this time, the fuel tank was filled with water, and the car stopped. Seeing that dawn was approaching and enemy planes were about to arrive, he hurriedly drank a few mouthfuls of alcohol, took off his cotton-padded clothes, mustered up courage, and jumped into the icy river water. He went back and forth in the river sixteen times in one breath, concealing half a carload of fried noodles and car parts in bunkers on the south bank of the Imjin River. He also deliberately messed up the car, disguising it as a broken car. After dawn, dozens of enemy planes circled over the river, and they were all fooled.
　　Since Comrade Bian Junhui entered Korea fourteen months ago, he has been running every night on the mountainous roads of Korea. He bravely overcame countless enemy blockades and obstacles, and delivered batches of materials from the motherland to the front-line positions, safely traveling 20,000 kilometers. He won the glorious title of "Ten Thousand Li Driver."

　　Korean Model Nurse Xu Jinyu
　　Korean model nurse Xu Jinyu has performed meritorious service several times in the work of rescuing wounded People's Army soldiers, winning four medals and being called "Mother of the Wounded" by People's Army soldiers.
　　Xu Jinyu joined a certain unit of the People's Army in October 1950 as a nurse. During the Fifth Campaign last year, a certain unit of the People's Army received the task of attacking the enemy in a certain area of ​​Gangwon Province. The battle began on May 10, and their troops were surrounded. Many wounded soldiers were left behind enemy lines, making transportation difficult. But they climbed mountains and waded through rivers, disregarding hunger and enemy plane strafing and bombing, and still managed to transport twenty wounded soldiers to the rear every day. At that time, Xu Jinyu was the secretary of the Korean Democratic Youth League branch. She often encouraged the nurses, so that the task of rescuing the wounded could be completed smoothly. Therefore, she won the Second Class Warrior Honor Medal.
　　During the Inje defense battle in June last year, the enemy launched an attack on the People's Army positions with two divisions of troops, and the battle was fierce. Xu Jinyu was then the transportation squad leader. She had to carry the wounded from the front line to the rear first line (about five or six li), and then transport them to the rear by car. Xu Jinyu persisted in this work for a month and rescued more than 400 wounded. After the battle, she won the Third Class National Flag Medal. In the battle at Height 1030.9 on the eastern front of Korea, Xu Jinyu, with the same selfless work spirit, won her first military medal. In another battle on the eastern front, Xu Jinyu served as a nurse in a field hospital. Because of her patient care for the wounded, she was called "Mother of the Wounded" by the wounded. At the same time, she also won another military medal for this reason.

　　向祖国的英雄子弟和朝鲜的英雄友人致敬
    阎金德和第三营的光辉战绩
    阎金德同志是志愿军某部三营的副教导员。在第五次战役中，三营曾突破敌人七道封锁，挺进一百二十里，楔入敌人心脏，胜利地攻占了道峰山，并荣获“道峰山营”的光荣称号。在粉碎敌人“秋季攻势”的高旺山反击战中，全营又荣获“高旺山头一功”的光荣锦旗。
    这里只叙述阎金德和第三营在攻击高旺山战斗中的光辉战绩。去年十一月二十三日，三营接受了主攻高旺山的任务。高旺山是临津江西岸的制高点，由敌人一个加强连据守着。战斗开始了，敌人用七八个炮群和七八辆坦克连续轰击，封锁着一段三百公尺的开阔地带，但这并没有阻止了三营的前进。我方强大的炮兵，发挥了极大的威力，压倒敌人炮火，掩护步兵在八分钟内冲过了封锁线。一个连从正面向敌人主阵地攻击，战士杨桂山，担负了爆破铁丝网、扫除冲锋障碍的任务。他紧随在炮火的后边，节节前进，用信号指挥着炮兵向敌人阵地的纵深轰击。敌人的铁丝网被炸平了，地堡被摧毁了，这时全连一声“冲杀”，迅速攻占了第一个山头。另一个连从左侧攻击，曾接连打退了敌人的三次反扑。二班战士邓天福，在战斗中更表现了英勇顽强。他一手射击，一手投弹，击退了敌人一个班的反扑后，又迅速突破了敌人的前沿阵地。接着，全连乘胜冲上山去，歼敌二百余名，将胜利的红旗插上了高旺山。
    攻占大和岛的英雄黄金明
    去年冬天的一个晚上，在朝鲜北部西海岸，海水在翻腾着波浪。这时，志愿军某部副连长黄金明，看了看手表上的时针已指到了出发时间，他立刻带领全连战士，登上了第一只船，在茫茫的黑夜里向大和岛进发。大和岛在铁山半岛的对面，岛上住着四百多李承晚伪军，直接威胁着我国的边疆城市——安东。
    船行在距大和岛五百公尺的地方，黄金明指挥炮手开始向岛上轰击。随后，他走进船舱里，紧紧地握着船工张永庆的手说：“为了祖国，为了朝鲜人民……”张永庆完全领会了他的意思，坚定地回答说：“连长，请放心，一定完成祖国人民交给我的任务。”船开足了马力，像箭头一样地向前飞驰。离岸一百五十公尺，激烈的战斗开始了。第一只船头上，被打了像小盆口样的一个洞，战士们用救生衣塞住它，踏在上面继续射击。船要靠岸了，敌人集中所有的火力，封锁着渡口，船上岸上变成了一片火海。黄金明站在船头上振臂高呼：“同志们，为祖国立功的时候到了，登陆就是胜利！”战士们纷纷跳进冰冷的海水，冒着密集的炮火翻上岸去，突破了敌人的滩头阵地。九班班长瞿开福负了重伤，他立即命令他的组长王凤强：“不要管我，快把全班带上去追击敌人。王凤强把脚一跺，带领全班战士迅速地占领了二○二高地。这时，兄弟连队也从侧面登陆成功，左右呼应，将敌人完全包围在大和岛上。
    战斗迅速地结束了，四百敌人全部就擒，无一漏网。
    “万里号司机”卞?晖
    在朝鲜第三次战役的一天夜晚，月亮挂在高空，志愿军某汽车连司机卞?晖正开着一台吉斯车，把祖国的慰劳品运往汉江前线。当汽车驶到新溪附近时，公路已被敌机封锁了。照明弹连续不断地往下投掷，把白雪掩盖着的公路照得分外明亮。只见白雪道上有两条黑影向前迅驰。敌人发现目标了，离车二、三公尺的地方，忽然炸开了三颗炸弹。紧接着，敌机又扫了一梭子子弹。卞?晖同志想：“车子是祖国人民的财产，慰劳品是祖国人民的血汗，可不能丢下！”于是，他加快了速度，趁敌机绕圈时，借着照明弹的光，冲过了封锁线。慰劳品送到前线阵地时，正赶上过春节，战士们吃着祖国送去的猪肉饺子，骄傲地说：“这是祖国送来的东西，咱们一定要打好仗来回答祖国人民的慰问。”
    去年春天，朝鲜的雪正在溶化，临津江的冰刚刚解冻，江里的冰块互相碰撞直往下冲。夜间的江潮涨了，正是一个墨黑的夜间，卞?晖开着一车炒面到了临津江边，桥被敌机炸毁了。当他想到前方打仗的战士正在等着炒面吃时，就不顾一切把汽车开往江心。这时汽油箱灌满了水，汽车停止发动了。眼看天快发亮，敌机就要到来。他急忙喝了几口酒精，脱下棉衣，鼓足勇气跳进了冰冷的江水。他一口气在江里来回了十六次，把半车炒面和汽车零件都掩蔽到了临津江南岸的地堡里。他又故意把车子搞得乱七八糟，伪装成一辆坏车。天亮以后，有几十架敌机在江上轮番盘旋，果然都被骗过去了。
    卞?晖同志入朝十四个月以来，每晚奔驰在朝鲜多山的公路上。他英勇地战胜了敌机无数次的封锁和阻扰，把祖国的物资一批批送到了前线阵地，安全行走了二万公里。他获得了“万里号司机”的光荣称号。
    朝鲜模范护士许金玉
    朝鲜模范护士许金玉，在救护人民军伤员的工作中好几次立了功，荣获四个奖章，被人民军伤员们称为“伤员的母亲”。
    许金玉于一九五○年十月参加人民军某部做护士。去年五次战役时，人民军某部接受了突击江原道某地敌人的任务。五月十日战斗开始，她们的部队被围，很多伤员留在敌后，运送困难。但她们爬山涉水，不顾饥饿和敌机扫射轰炸，依然设法每天运送了二十名伤员到后方。当时许金玉是朝鲜民主青年同盟支部书记，她经常鼓励护士同志们，使救护伤员的任务能够顺利地完成，因此，她荣获二级战士荣誉奖章。
    在去年六月麟蹄防御战中，敌人以二个师的兵力向人民军阵地发动攻击，战斗激烈。许金玉当时担任输送班长，要把伤员从火线上背到后方第一线（约五、六里地），再用汽车输送到后方。许金玉坚持这个工作达一个月之久，共抢救了四百多名伤员。在这次战斗结束后，她又荣获三级国旗勋章。在朝鲜东线一○三○·九高地的战斗中，许金玉以同样的忘我的工作精神，第一次荣获军功章。在东线的另一次战斗中，许金玉担任野战医院的护士，由于她耐心地扶侍伤员，被伤员们称为“伤员的母亲”。同时，她也因此再一次荣获军功章。（）
