    Exposed the Essence of Reformism
    – Notes after Reading Stalin's "Conversation with the British Writer H.G. Wells"
    Professor Sheng Xugong, Department of Geography, Beijing Normal University

    (I)
    Reformists are dissatisfied with the status quo and advocate using "reform" methods on the old social foundation to slowly "improve" the existing order. This kind of thinking once lured us, the intellectuals from small and middle-bourgeois families, to harbor illusions and sympathy for the reformists, believing that even if they were not revolutionaries, they were not counter-revolutionaries; believing that reformist ideology was not reactionary, and that it had a progressive side. This caused us to be consciously or unconsciously influenced by reformist ideas, to the point where we became reformists in our actions.

    This teacher training gave me the opportunity to read Stalin's "Conversation with the British Writer H.G. Wells." I skimmed it first, then studied it carefully, repeatedly, initially trying to understand and appreciate it bit by bit, until I suddenly realized: reformist ideology is reactionary in essence, and reformists are actually reactionary—Wells is a typical example. Wells' reformist mask was torn off by Stalin, exposing his reactionary essence, and he fled in embarrassment. The record of Stalin's conversation with Wells profoundly educated me, educating us, the intellectuals from small and middle-bourgeois families who had once fallen into the quagmire of reformism.

    (II)
    Intellectuals from the bourgeoisie clearly possess the class nature of the bourgeoisie, and individual liberalism is an expression of this class nature, yet they regard themselves as "supra-class." Some of them have consciously or unconsciously served the reactionary ruling class, even climbing to a reactionary position themselves, yet they regard themselves as "middle-of-the-roaders." Wells is such a person. Wells considers himself an "ordinary person." Stalin immediately pointed out that he is not an "ordinary person," but a "great activist." What is an "ordinary person"? In Wells' mind, it is probably the "third kind of person," or a "middle-of-the-roader"? Stalin directly pointed out to him: "But in any case, you are not looking at the world as an 'ordinary person'." Thus, Wells' bourgeois tail was exposed. However, precisely because Wells sees himself as a "middle-of-the-roader," this "supra-class" thinking makes it impossible for him to have a correct view of the "things going on around him." He completely fails to understand the essential difference between two socio-economic systems—capitalism and socialism—and mistakenly regards Roosevelt's "New Deal" as implementing socialist economics and planned economics, just like the Soviet Union. He also completely fails to understand the class nature of people, and mistakenly equates Stalin and Roosevelt, thinking that Roosevelt is also a great figure transforming the world, although their guiding ideologies are different, starting from "two different starting points."

    Bourgeois scholars cannot have a correct understanding of world affairs and figures. Although Wells considers himself a "middle-of-the-road," "supra-class," "ordinary person," he is, in essence, representing the bourgeoisie and defending the interests of the bourgeoisie. He denies class contradictions, denies the power of the broad masses of the people, and thus opposes class struggle and "violent" revolution. He advocates supporting the existing order, supporting the existing system, and maintaining the existing order by supporting the existing system. He said: "If the existing system does not guarantee order, I will attack it." What does this mean? It means not opposing "it," but cherishing "it," blaming "it" for being powerless to guarantee order. This fully demonstrates the bankruptcy of Wells' reformism, and from a "supra-class" standpoint, he has fallen to the reactionary side. The bankruptcy of Wells' thought profoundly taught me: the road of reformism is impassable, and there is no middle ground. Either you fall to the side of revolution, or you inevitably fall to the side of counter-revolution!

    (III)
    From Stalin's conversation with Wells, I deeply realized that bourgeois intellectuals are truly ignorant and unknowing. Because they stand on the position of the bourgeoisie—whether consciously or unconsciously—their view of the objective world cannot be correct. Only by betraying their own class, standing on the position of the working class, and thoroughly transforming their thinking with Marxism-Leninism, can they correctly understand the world. Because the world is created by the working people, and only the thinking of the working people, the thinking of Marxism-Leninism, is the only correct thinking.

    Wells was praised as a first-rate scholar in bourgeois society—a great historian, a great writer, a great thinker—but how foolish, ignorant, and stubborn he appears in front of Stalin! How confused and contradictory his thoughts appear! Wells is deceived by the appearances of things, not knowing how to seek the essence of things, mistakenly believing that Roosevelt's "New Deal" is implementing socialism. Wells stands on a "supra-class" position (actually standing on the position of the bourgeoisie) to deny the opposition of social classes; at the same time, based on the simple technical viewpoint of bourgeois intellectuals, he isolates and excessively emphasizes the role of intellectuals, scientists, and technicians, and even the so-called "organizers" (actually organizers of bourgeois interests). Especially absurd is that he praises bloodsucking "kings" like Rockefeller and Ford as "excellent organizers," believing that these people are the ones who carry out social reform (which he calls revolution). He simply does not understand that only the working people are the force driving social development and creating the world. Wells also believes, based on a "supra-class," "supra-political" simple technical viewpoint, that the old world is collapsing on its own, that "the ruling system is being destroyed anyway," and that our work "should be placed on efficiency, on qualifications, on productivity." In other words, it should be placed on simple technology, and little by little, we can transform it into a socialist society. Conversely, Wells believes that revolution is a "riot" and that "communist propaganda is an obstacle," which he believes is an act of destroying the existing system and existing order of the old world. Wells is a historian, no, a bourgeois idealist historian. Wells is not a socialist, in essence, he is an anti-socialist.

    (IV)
    Wells' reactionary position, viewpoints, and ideology were shattered by Stalin. But the stubborn Wells did not realize it at all. At the end of the conversation, Wells used the words "No, I wish all mankind were smarter" to resist Stalin's wise suggestion of "If we Bolsheviks were smarter." He was worried that there was no freedom to express all opinions in the Soviet Union, and Stalin's answer was: "This is what we Bolsheviks call 'self-criticism'." This is something Wells was unwilling to accept and unable to understand.

    Stalin's conversation with Wells educated me. In the past, although I opposed the order of the Kuomintang reactionary rule in my mind, I did not dare to join the revolutionary camp to carry out the struggle to overthrow the old order. This kind of thinking of being dissatisfied with the status quo but fearing struggle precisely represents my petty-bourgeois nature. My thinking also has "supra-class," "supra-political," and simple technical viewpoints. I once regarded myself as a "middle-of-the-roader," and once fantasized about reformism, fantasized about the "third way." Therefore, I just stood beside the revolutionary struggle as an "observer." I once yearned for socialist and communist society, but I did not clearly understand how to realize it. In my "World Economic Geography," which I wrote before liberation and revised after liberation, I actually equated the "Soviet Bloc" and the "American Bloc," and regarded the people's democratic countries as the "bulwark" of the Soviet Union, while believing that the people's democratic countries should be used as a bridge between the two major "blocs." Isn't this the Wells's type of thinking?

    In Stalin's conversation with Wells, Stalin used the mirror of Marxism-Leninism to show Wells' true face, and also showed my wrong thinking. At the same time, he pointed out a path of ideological transformation to me, that is, only by betraying one's own petty-bourgeois position, standing on the position of the working class, and learning Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, can one thoroughly transform one's thinking.

    揭穿了改良主义的实质
    ——读斯大林“与英国作家威尔斯的谈话”后的笔记
    北京师范大学地理系教授　盛叙功
    （一）
    改良主义者不满意现状，主张在旧的社会基础上用“改良”的方法慢慢地来“改良”现存秩序。这一种思想在过去曾诱惑了我们这批中小资产阶级出身的知识分子，对于改良派寄予幻想、同情，认为他们即使不革命，也不是反革命；认为改良主义思想不是反动的思想，它有进步的一面。这样就使得我们自觉或不自觉地受到了改良主义思想的影响，以至在行动上成了改良派。
    这次教师学习使我有机会来阅读斯大林“与英国作家威尔斯的谈话”，先浏览而后精读，三反四复，初则一点一滴地去理解，去体会，终至恍然大悟：改良主义思想在实质上是反动的思想，改良派实际上是反动的——威尔斯就是这样一个典型人物。威尔斯的改良主义的假面具被斯大林揭穿，暴露了反动的本质以后，狼狈地逃走了。斯大林和威尔斯的谈话记录却极其深刻地教育了我，教育了我们这一批中小资产阶级出身的曾经堕入过改良主义泥坑中的知识分子。
    （二）
    出身于资产阶级的知识分子显明地具有资产阶级的阶级性，个人自由主义就是这种阶级性的表现，可是他们竟把自己看做“超阶级”的。其中某些人曾经自觉或不自觉地为反动统治阶级服务，甚至于自己爬上了反动地位，可是他们竟把自己看作“中间派”。威尔斯就是这样一种人。威尔斯把自己当作一个“普通人”。斯大林立即指出他并不是一个
    “普通人”，而是一个“大活动家”。什么是“普通人”呢？在威尔斯的意识中，大概是“第三种人”吧？或是“中间派”吧？斯大林直截了当地向他指出：“但是无论如何您并不是作为一个‘普通人’来看世界的。”于是，威尔斯的资产阶级的尾巴被揭露了。然而，正由于威尔斯把自己看作“中间派”，这种“超阶级”的思想使他对于他所要看的
    “周围所进行的事情”不可能有正确的看法。他完全不懂得两种社会经济制度——资本主义和社会主义——本质上的不同，而错误地将罗斯福的“新政”看作是和苏联同样在实施社会主义经济、计划经济。他也完全不懂得人的阶级性，竟错误地把斯大林和罗斯福对等并立起来，在威尔斯的心目中罗斯福同样是改造世界的伟大人物，虽则领导思想不同，是从“两个不同的起点出发的”。
    资产阶级学者不可能对世界的事情和人物有正确的认识。威尔斯虽则以中间派的“超阶级”的“普通人”自居，而实质上他是代表资产阶级、维护资产阶级的利益的。他否认阶级的矛盾，否认广大人民的力量，从而反对阶级斗争，反对“暴力”革命。他主张拥护现存秩序，拥护现存体系，以拥护现存体系来维持现存秩序。他说：“要是现存体系不保证秩序的话，我就攻击它。”这是什么意思呢？那就是不反对“它”，而是爱护“它”，是责怪“它”无力保证秩序。这充分说明了威尔斯改良主义的破产，并且在“超阶级”的立场上倒了下来，倒到反动的那一边去。威尔斯思想的破产极其深刻地教训了我：改良主义的道路是走不通的，中间路线是不存在的。不是倒向革命这一边，就必然倒向反革命那一边！
    （三）
    从斯大林和威尔斯的谈话中，我深深地体会到资产阶级的知识分子实在是无知无识。因为他们站在资产阶级的立场——不论自觉或不自觉地，所以对于客观世界的看法，不可能是正确的。他们只有背叛了自己的阶级，站在工人阶级的立场，用马克思列宁主义，彻底改造自己的思想，才有可能正确地认识世界。因为世界是劳动人民所创造的，惟有劳动人民的思想，马克思列宁主义的思想，才是惟一正确的思想。
    威尔斯在资产阶级社会里曾被誉为第一流大学者——大历史家、大文学家、大思想家，而在斯大林面前是显得如何愚蠢无知，冥顽不灵。他的思想是显得怎样混乱矛盾！威尔斯被一些事物的表象所迷惑，不知道去探求事物的本质，误以为罗斯福的“新政”是在实行社会主义。威尔斯是站在“超阶级”的立场（实际上是站在资产阶级的立场）来否认社会阶级的对立；同时他本着资产阶级知识分子的单纯技术观点，孤立地、过分地强调知识分子、科学技术者，以至所谓“组织者”（实际上是资产阶级利益的组织者）的作用。尤其荒谬的是，他把洛克菲勒、福特之类的吸血“大王”推崇为“出色的组织者”，认为社会改革事业（他叫作革命）是这些人干的，他根本不懂得只有劳动人民才是推动社会发展、创造世界的力量。威尔斯同样本着“超阶级”、“超政治”的单纯技术观点，认为旧世界在自行崩溃着，“统治体系横竖在毁坏着”，我们的工作“应该放在效力上，放在资格上，放在生产率上”。换言之，就是放在单纯技术上，一点一滴地来改良，就可以把它改造成社会主义的社会。相反地，威尔斯认为革命是一种“骚乱”，“共产主义宣传是一种障碍”，他认为那是破坏旧世界现存体系、现存秩序的行为。威尔斯是个历史家，不，是个资产阶级唯心主义的历史家。威尔斯不是一个社会主义者，在实质上，他是一个反社会主义者。
    （四）
    威尔斯的反动的立场、观点和思想方法，被斯大林粉碎了。可是顽固的威尔斯竟丝毫没有觉悟过来。在谈话将结束的时候，威尔斯用“不，但愿一般人类都更聪明些”的词句，来抗拒斯大林的“如果我们布尔什维克更聪明些”的英明的提示。他担心在苏联没有自由发表一切意见的权利，而斯大林的回答是：“这在我们布尔什维克这里就叫作‘自我批评’。”这是威尔斯所不乐于接受而且理解不到的。
    斯大林和威尔斯的谈话，教育了我。过去，我虽然在思想上反对国民党反动统治的秩序，但又不敢参加到革命阵营中去进行推翻旧秩序的斗争。这种不满意现状而又畏惧斗争的思想，正表示了我的小资产阶级的本性。我的思想中同样有着“超阶级”、“超政治”和单纯技术观点，我曾经把自己看作“中间派”，曾经幻想过改良主义，幻想过“第三条路线”。因此，我只是站在革命斗争的旁边，作一个“观察者”。我曾经憧憬社会主义和共产主义社会，然而并没有明确地理解到应当怎样去实现它。在我解放前所写、解放后曾修订过的“世界经济地理”中，我竟把“苏联集团”和“美国集团”对等并立起来，又把人民民主国家看作苏联的“拱卫”，同时认为应当把人民民主国家作为两大“集团”之间的桥梁。这不是威尔斯的思想类型是什么？
    在斯大林和威尔斯的谈话中，斯大林用马克思列宁主义的镜子照出了威尔斯的真面目，也照出了我的错误思想。同时向我指出了一条思想改造的途径，就是惟有背叛自己的小资产阶级的立场，站在工人阶级的立场，学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，才能彻底改造自己的思想。
