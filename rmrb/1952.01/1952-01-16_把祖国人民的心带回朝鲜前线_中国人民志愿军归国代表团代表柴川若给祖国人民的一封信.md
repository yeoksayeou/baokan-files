Dear compatriots of the motherland:

After returning to the front line with the ardent expectations of the people of the motherland, we followed Commander Peng's orders to report to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean people about the great achievements and exemplary actions of the people of the motherland in launching the Resist-America, Aid-Korea, Protect-the-Homeland movement under the banner of Chairman Mao, and to convey the instructions of the people of the whole country to all comrades of the Volunteer Army. For more than two months, we traveled more than 28,000 li on the war-torn Korean battlefield, from the Yalu River to the 38th parallel, from the east coast to the west coast, spending 1,400 hours giving more than 300 reports. More than 200,000 representatives have directly attended the reports, but our work is not yet finished and is currently underway.

Our report meetings are mostly held at night or in air-raid shelters, and sometimes during the day under the cover of artillery fire. On rainy days, we put on raincoats and held meetings in the rain. It has long since snowed in Korea, with several inches of snow on the ground, and we hold meetings in the snow. The same is true at the front line, we still hold meetings, even when artillery shells are flying into the crowd and sulfur bombs are landing nearby and burning, we have not stopped. Once, when I was giving a report in a certain unit, some representatives came from ninety li away, sweating profusely and panting, and walked into the meeting place, listening to the report for five hours straight. They said, "Listening to such reports, we don't feel hungry even if we don't eat for three days." The opening ceremonies were very grand, with a platform set up, pine gates erected, and a portrait of Chairman Mao hung on the curtain. Unit leaders and heroic models formed the presidium, and troops gathered from various combat posts, carrying weapons, wearing new shoes and new clothes, singing the majestic songs "Ode to the Motherland" and "Heroic and High-Spirited," marched into the meeting place in neat steps. The military band and ensemble played majestic military music, escorting us to the platform. The soldiers cheered, "Our representatives are back!" Several times, the soldier representatives presented us with flowers. These flowers were specially made, some made of pine needles, some made of paper, and some made of copper wire stolen from the enemy. The soldiers sometimes lifted us up or scrambled to shake our hands. We dared not accept this honor, but the comrades said, "You brought the hearts of the entire army back to the motherland, and now you are bringing the hearts of the people of the motherland back to the front line. Your hands have been held by the people of the motherland. Shaking your hands is like shaking hands with the people of the motherland!" We said, "Honor belongs to the people of the whole country and the People's Volunteer Army! It belongs to the great motherland and the great people's leader, Chairman Mao!" Once at a general meeting, the weather was very cold, with the northwest wind blowing in our faces. I proposed that the troops turn around, but this was unexpectedly opposed by the presidium of the meeting and all the commanders and fighters. They said, "We have been abroad for more than a year, always squatting in fortifications, facing the enemy. Now that we are hearing news from the motherland, we should face the motherland, face Chairman Mao!"

After listening to our reports, the Volunteer Army comrades' confidence in victory was further enhanced. They said, "At this time last year, we were fighting on the 38th parallel. Now, after fighting for a year, the American devils and their accomplice troops have been wiped out by us by four or five hundred thousand. If the enemy still insists on its policy of aggression, and we continue to fight like this, the American devils will be wiped out by us by several million. At that time, our enemy will be weakened to who knows what extent, while the strength of our motherland and the people of the world will be many times stronger than it is now!" The Korean people and the comrades of the People's Army were also very excited after listening to our reports. They said, "With the full support of the great Chinese people, we are not afraid of anything!"

We thank Chairman Mao for his education and cultivation of us, and we thank the people of the motherland for their strong spiritual and material support and encouragement! We believe that our motherland and Chairman Mao are glory and victory! For the sake of the motherland, for the sake of Chairman Mao, we are living, working, and fighting in glory and victory! Our Volunteer Army will never fail to live up to the ardent expectations of the people of the motherland, and will never fail to live up to Chairman Mao's education and cultivation of us. Our homecoming delegation must complete our sacred task of delivering reports! When we were in the southern provinces of the motherland, the weather was hot. Now the Korean battlefield is a world of ice and snow. But this has not had the slightest impact on our work. For example, Comrade Ji Bingqian, one of our homecoming representatives, lost eight kilograms during his time in the motherland. He said, "I'm thinner, but my spirit is stronger!" Recently, he worked on the front line, giving twenty-seven hours of reports in three days. Comrade Dou Shaoqi gave forty hours of reports in four days in the Subei Administrative Region, and recently convened a conference of more than 3,000 people on the front line. Without amplification equipment, he spoke for more than five hours each time. Comrade Li Weiying has given more than two hundred hours of speeches since returning to the front line. Recently, he was injured in the leg while working on the eastern front. He is determined to continue to complete his glorious mission while sitting on a stretcher! He said, "I cannot fail to live up to the trust of all the commanders and fighters! Even more so, I cannot fail to live up to the trust of the people of the motherland!"

When we were in the motherland, we deeply felt that our motherland is vast and populous, the patriotic sentiment is high, everyone cares about the Volunteer Army, and everyone wants to meet us and pay their respects to the Volunteer Army. But we few people really cannot meet this demand. Now that we have returned to the front line, we deeply feel that the soldiers miss the motherland and want to hear the instructions of the people of the motherland. Many people say, "Listening for ten days and ten nights is not enough." And we are even more unable to meet this demand. When we reflected this situation to our superiors, the leaders unanimously decided to send a larger delegation to visit all parts of the country in the near future. That may be to all counties and cities across the country, and may even be to factories, schools, hospitals, and rural areas. In this way, the feelings between our front and rear will be closer, the work between the front and rear will be more coordinated, and our infinite strength will be increased.

Dear compatriots! At present, the main situation of the Korean War is still a serious war. The enemy's atrocities are continuing; the enemy's attacks have not stopped for a single day. For example, in Pyongyang alone, the peaceful residents who were killed or injured by enemy aircraft bombing during the armistice negotiations numbered several thousand. I have been to Pyongyang twice, and not a day goes by without being subjected to enemy air raids. Once, during the time I was giving a report, enemy aircraft dropped more than forty heavy bombs, killing and injuring dozens of people. But we are not afraid of any difficulties! We can crush any attacks! This is powerfully illustrated by the fact that the number of enemies wiped out has been increasing more and more over the past year. For example, in August and September last year, there was a flood throughout Korea, washing away bridges and boats. The supply of our frontline troops suffered difficulties for a time. All our commanders and fighters overcame these difficulties with amazing spirit, practicing frugality with food, even eating wild vegetables to satisfy their hunger, and finally survived the flood period and repelled more than a hundred serious enemy attacks. Furthermore, the enemy attempted to destroy agricultural production in the rear of Korea. Enemy aircraft often strafed farmers in the fields. Our Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army helped the masses to plant rice seedlings in the gaps between battles. A certain unit of the Volunteer Army alone rushed to plant more than 15,000 mu of rice seedlings, helping the Korean people to strive for a bumper harvest. During the autumn harvest, the Volunteer Army also helped the Korean people with the harvest. In addition, the cities and villages burned down by the enemy were rebuilt by all the Volunteer Army, who built many underground rooms that were warm in winter and cool in summer. When enemy aircraft invaded, the Volunteer Army launched mass shooting campaigns. A certain unit shot down seven enemy aircraft in one day, December 16. The Volunteer Army also launched a frugality campaign. Since a certain unit implemented the movement to sweep up grain, it has swept up more than 3,000 jin, and collected more than one million jin of firewood burned by gasoline bombs on the mountains. They also saved ammunition, without wasting a single bullet, repairing shoes and socks, and wearing each pair of shoes for two more months. Six cooks in a certain unit cooked for one hundred and eighty people; automobile drivers implemented new plans to ensure that not a single drop of gasoline was wasted. Therefore, we are not only able to overcome difficulties and defeat the enemy, but also greatly save the manpower and material resources of the motherland.

The fundamental reason why we are able to defeat the enemy and overcome difficulties is that the nature of our anti-aggression war is just, and our morale is rising higher and higher, while the essence of the enemy's war of aggression determines that it is impossible for them to have high morale, and their morale can only decline the more they fight. We have the enthusiastic support of the people of China and Korea, and the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world. We will definitely be able to achieve final victory!

We spent 1951 in victorious struggle. Let us welcome even greater victories in 1952 on the basis of victory!

Let us celebrate with infinite excitement and gratitude the great achievements made by our people on all fronts over the past year. Let us unite under the banner of Chairman Mao and struggle to create greater achievements! Struggle to win a complete victory in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea war!

### 把祖国人民的心带回朝鲜前线  中国人民志愿军归国代表团代表柴川若给祖国人民的一封信

    把祖国人民的心带回朝鲜前线
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团代表柴川若给祖国人民的一封信亲爱的祖国同胞们：
    我们带着祖国人民的热望，重返前线以后，就奉了彭司令员的命令，向中国人民志愿军全体指战员和朝鲜人民，报告祖国人民在毛主席旗帜下，开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动的伟大成就和范例，传达全国人民对志愿军全体同志的嘱咐。两个多月，我们在战火纷飞的朝鲜战场上，从鸭绿江到三八线，从东海岸到西海岸，共走了两万八千多里路，用一千四百个钟头的时间，作了三百多次报告。直接见面听报告的代表，已经有二十多万人了，但是我们的工作，并没有完结，现正紧张地进行着。
    我们的传达大会，多半是在夜晚或在防空洞里举行的，有时在炮火掩护下，白天也开会。下雨天，我们就披上雨衣在雨中开会。现在朝鲜早已下了大雪，地上积雪数寸，我们就在雪地里开会。在最前线，也是一样开会，甚至炮弹皮子飞在人群中，硫磺弹落在附近燃烧，也没有停止过。有一次，我在某部作报告，有些代表从九十里路以外赶来，淌着大汗，喘着粗气，就走进会场，连听五个钟头报告。他们说：“听这样的报告，三天不吃饭，也不觉着饿。”开会的仪式，都很隆重，搭起主席台，扎起松门，把毛主席像挂在幕布上，部队首长和英雄模范组成主席团，从各个战斗岗位上集中起来的部队，背着武器、穿上新鞋和新衣服，唱着雄壮的“歌唱祖国”和“雄赳赳气昂昂”的歌子，以整齐的步伐走进会场，军乐队和协奏团奏着雄壮的军乐，把我们送到主席台上。战士们欢呼：“咱们的代表回来了！”有几次，战士代表献给我们鲜花，这些鲜花是特制的，有些是松树叶子扎起来的，有些是用纸扎的，有些是用缴获敌人的铜丝电线扎起来的。战士们有时还把我们抬起来，或抢着同我们握手。我们不敢接受这种荣誉，同志们却说：“你们把全军的心带回祖国，现在又把祖国人民的心带回前线，你们的手，是被祖国人民握过的，握了你们的手，就等于和祖国人民握手！”我们说：“荣誉属于全国人民和人民志愿军！属于伟大的祖国和伟大的人民领袖毛主席！”有一次开大会，天气很冷，西北风迎面扑来，我提议部队向后转，却遭到大会主席团和全体指战员意外的反对，他们说：“我们出国一年多了，老是蹲在工事里，面对着敌人，现在听祖国的音讯，应该面向祖国，面向毛主席！”
    志愿军同志们听了我们的报告以后，胜利信心更加提高了，他们说：“去年这个时候，我们战斗在三八线上，现在打了一年，美国鬼子和他的帮凶军被我们消灭了四五十万，如果敌人仍然坚持侵略政策，照这样打下去，美国鬼子被我们消灭几百万，那时，我们的敌人，不知要削弱成什么样子，而我们的祖国和全世界人民的力量，又不知比现在要强大多少倍哩！”朝鲜人民和人民军的同志听了我们的报告以后，也十分兴奋，他们说：“有伟大的中国人民全力支援，我们就什么也不怕！”
    我们感谢毛主席对于我们的教养，感谢祖国人民在精神上物质上对我们的大力支援和鼓励！我们相信，我们的祖国和毛主席，就是光荣和胜利！为了祖国，为了毛主席，我们是在光荣和胜利中生活着、工作着、战斗着！我们志愿军，决不会辜负祖国人民寄予我们的热望，决不会辜负毛主席对于我们的教养，我们归国代表团，一定要完成我们神圣的传达报告任务！当我们在祖国的南方各省的时候，天气是炎热的，现在朝鲜战场，又是冰天雪地了。但是这对我们的工作，没有发生丝毫影响。例如我们归国代表中的嵇炳前同志，在归国期间，体重减轻了八公斤，他说：“人是瘦了，精神却旺了！”最近他在阵地前沿工作，三天之内，作了二十七个小时的报告。窦少毅同志在苏北行政区，四天作了四十个小时的报告，最近又在最前线召集三千余人的大会，没有扩音设备，每次讲五个多钟头。李维英同志重返前线后，已经讲了二百多个小时，最近在东线工作时腿部负了伤，他决心坐在担架上，继续完成光荣的任务！他说：“我不能辜负全体指战员的委托！更不能辜负祖国人民的委托！”
    当我们在祖国的时候，我们深深地感觉到我们祖国幅员广大，人口众多，爱国情绪高涨，人人关心着志愿军，都要求与我们见面，都要向志愿军致意，而我们几个人，实在不能满足这种要求，现在我们回到前线，又深深地感觉到战士们怀念祖国，要听祖国人民的嘱咐，许多人说：“就听十天十夜也没有够。”而我们是更加不能满足这种要求了。当我们把这个情况反映到上级时，首长便一致决定，在最近再派遣较大规模的代表团访问全国各地。那就可能到全国各县市，甚至可能到工厂、学校、医院和农村里去。这样，将会使我们前后方的感情更加接近一步，前后方的工作更加协调一致，增加我们无限的力量。
    亲爱的同胞们！目前朝鲜战争的主要情况，仍然是严重的战争。敌人的暴行，一直是在继续着；敌人的进攻，一天也没有停止过。例如平壤一地，仅在停战谈判期间，遭受敌机轰炸而死伤的和平居民，即达数千人。我两次到平壤，没有一天不遭受敌机空袭。有一次，在我作报告的时间内，敌机就投下重磅炸弹四十余枚，死伤群众数十人。但是任何的困难，我们都不怕！任何的进攻，我们都可以粉碎它！这只要看一年以来敌人被消灭的数目，越来越多，就是有力的说明。比如去年八九月间，全朝鲜发生了一次洪水，冲断桥梁，冲走船只，我前线部队的供应，一时遭受到困难，我全体指战员即以惊人的克服困难的精神，实行节约粮食，甚至以野菜充饥，终于度过了洪水期，并打退敌人一百余次严重的进攻。再如敌人企图破坏朝鲜后方的农业生产，敌机经常扫射田里的农民，我志愿军和朝鲜人民军即在战斗空隙中，帮助群众插秧。仅志愿军某部，即抢插稻秧一万五千余亩，帮助朝鲜人民争取大丰收。秋收时志愿军又帮助朝鲜人民抢收。还有，敌人烧毁了的城市和乡村，全体志愿军，即自己动手，建造了许多冬暖夏凉的地下室。敌人的飞机侵犯，志愿军即开展群众性射击。某部在十二月十六日一天之内，即击落敌机七架。志愿军还开展节约运动，某部实行扫粮运动以来，已扫了三千余斤，上山收集被汽油弹烧过的木柴一百余万斤。还节省弹药，不浪费一粒子弹，修补鞋袜，每双鞋要多穿两个月。某部六个炊事员，做一百八十个人的饭；汽车驾驶员实行新的计划，保证不浪费一点汽油。因此，我们不但能够克服困难战胜敌人，而且还要大大地节省祖国的人力物力。
    我们能够战胜敌人和战胜困难的根本原因，就是我们的反侵略战争的性质是正义的，士气越打越高，而敌人的侵略战争的本质，决定了他不可能有高涨的士气，而只能越打情绪越低落。我们有朝中两国人民热烈支援，有全世界爱好和平的人类同情和支援，我们一定能够取得最后的胜利！
    一九五一年，我们在胜利的斗争中度过了，让我们在胜利的基础上，迎接一九五二年更大的胜利！
    让我们以无限兴奋和感激的心情，庆贺我国人民一年以来在各个战线上所取得的伟大成就，让我们团结在毛主席的旗帜下，为创造更大的成就而斗争！为争取抗美援朝的圆满胜利而斗争！
