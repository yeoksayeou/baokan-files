    Li Shusheng, a Model of Integrity and Public Service
    A collaboration by Qin Zheng, Zhao Panbin, Make Ming, Wang Yutang, Liu Yuhuan, Xu Tiankai, Wuen, and Xu Guang

    1. Li Shusheng is a cadre of peasant origin who joined the revolution in 1946. After the victory of the Liberation War, he went to the Xi'an Public People's Construction Company as a purchasing agent. He often ran around in the city and saw many people dressed very "lavishly," while he himself wore simple homespun clothes from head to toe, which made him feel somewhat uncomfortable.

    2. He frankly reported his thoughts and feelings to the leading comrades. The manager repeatedly told him: "Comrade! Our revolutionary cadres' style of hard work and simplicity is most precious! The tricks of the treacherous merchants are numerous, so be careful at all times and don't be fooled!" From then on, Li Shusheng became more vigilant, always being very careful whenever he came into contact with merchants.

    3. Once, Li Shusheng went to Wenru Wood Shop to buy 160 bundles of roof battens, agreeing on a price of 36,500 yuan per bundle; but the invoice was written as 38,500 yuan. Li Shusheng was baffled when he saw it. He questioned the boss. Seeing that the situation was not good, the boss hurriedly apologized and pretended to blame the bookkeeper, saying, "Why did you make a mistake on the invoice? Issue another one for Comrade Li!"

    廉洁奉公的李树生

    一、李树生是农民出身的干部，一九四六年参加革命工作。解放战争胜利后，到西安公营人民建筑公司当采购员。他时常在市面上跑来跑去，看见许多人都穿得很“阔气”，自己却上下一身土布衣服心里有些不舒服。
    二、他坦白地把自己的思想情绪向领导同志作了报告。经理再三地嘱咐他说：“同志！我们革命干部艰苦朴素的作风是最可珍贵的！奸商们的鬼花样很多，要时时刻刻留心，不要上他们的当！”从此李树生就时时提高警惕，每逢和商人接触时，总是非常小心。
    三、有一次，李树生到温如木行去买了一百六十捆挂瓦木条，讲好每捆价钱三万六千五百元；但是发票却写的是三万八千五百元。李树生看了莫名其妙。就向老板质问。老板见势头不对，连忙陪礼，并装模作样地责怪管账的说：“为什么把发票开错了？另给李同志开一张！”
