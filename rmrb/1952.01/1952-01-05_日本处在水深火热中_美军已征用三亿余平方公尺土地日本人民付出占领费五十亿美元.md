Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd. TASS Moscow: The "Pravda" published a dispatch from Tokyo by Kokin on December 29th, entitled "Under the Rule of the Occupiers." Kokin wrote: Americans swarm in Tokyo like worms swarm on a piece of rotten wood. Americans of all classes and statuses, all trades and ages, attracted by the stimulating scent of profit, run around everywhere.

At the entrances of hotels, cinemas, and shops, and on elevators specially designated for Americans in department stores, one can see notices like this: "Foreigners Only." Cinemas show mind-numbing detective films. Tokyo shows as many as 150 American films every year. The turbid current of American "civilization" overwhelms Tokyo, overwhelming Tokyo's educational institutions, bookstores, and newsstands. There, nauseating new products slandering the Soviet Union are sold alongside souvenirs such as postcards printed with Hiroshima, which was destroyed by American atomic bombs.

Kokin continued to write: Everything in Tokyo—from the gloomy building of Ridgway Headquarters flying the American flag to the English words on signs and advertisements; it seems that Tokyo's streets are called "Streets" and "Avenues" in the American style—seems to prove that Americans have already settled in Japan and have long been the masters.

According to estimates by the union of the Japan National Special Procurement (Supply) Agency, as of July 1, 1951, nearly 14,000 cases of forced requisition of land from Japanese citizens had been registered. The invaders requisitioned more than 366.6 million square meters of land from residents and drove people out of thousands of houses. According to newspaper reports, Ridgway Headquarters plans to requisition another 215 million square meters of land from the Japanese people in the near future. The occupation authorities are expanding their military base areas from one coastal area to another, leaving thousands of fishing families who have relied on fishing for generations without food.

The American occupation of Japan has already cost the Japanese people $5 billion. Judging from the 1952 budget, maintaining the US military in the future will cost even more money.

The Japanese Diet has already approved the most shameful separate treaty. Washington is also about to ratify this "treaty." But this does not mean that the time for Japan to gain freedom and independence is near. On the contrary, American imperialists are turning Japan into their base and a supply of cannon fodder in order to wage another war against the freedom-loving people of the world.

    日本处在水深火热中
    美军已征用三亿余平方公尺土地日本人民付出占领费五十亿美元
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报十二月二十九日发表了科金发自东京的电讯，题为“在占领者的统治下”。科金写道：美国人麇集在东京，像虫子麇集在一块腐木上一样。各种阶级和地位、各种行业和年龄的美国人，被富有刺激性的利润的气味所吸引，到处跑来跑去。
    在旅馆、电影院和商店的门口，在百货店特别指定给美国人用的电梯上，可以看见这样的布告——“只有外国人可以来此”。电影院放映使人神志不清的侦探片子。东京每年放映的美国影片多到一百五十部。美国“文明”的浊流淹没了东京，淹没了东京的教育机构、书店和报摊。在那里，令人作呕的诽谤苏联的新货品和印着被美国原子弹炸毁了的广岛的明信片之类的纪念品并列着出售。
    科金继续写道：东京的一切——从飘着美国旗帜的李奇微总部的阴森的大楼到招牌、广告上的英文字，都令人想到东京的街道是按美国方式称作“街”和“大道”的——都似乎证明：美国人已经在日本定居下来了，并且早已当了主人了。
    根据日本全国特别调达（供应）厅工会的估计，到一九五一年七月一日，已经登记了差不多一万四千起强迫征用日本公民的土地的事情。侵略者向居民征用了三亿六千六百多万平方公尺的土地，并把人民由数以千计的房屋中赶走。根据报纸消息，李奇微总部打算在最近的将来再向日本人民征用二亿一千五百万平方公尺土地。占领当局把他们的军事基地区域从一个滨海地区扩充到又一个滨海地区，这使得世世代代靠渔业为生的数以千计的渔民家庭没有饭吃。
    美国对日本的占领已经花去了日本人民五十亿美元。由一九五二年的预算看来，将来维持美军还会花去更多的钱。
    日本国会已经批准了最可耻的单独和约。华盛顿也快要批准这个“和约”了。但是这并不意味着日本获得自由和独立的时间已经接近。相反的，美帝国主义者正在把日本变成他们的基地，变成炮灰供应处，以便再对世界上爱好自由的人民进行一次战争。
