    The Resourceful and Valiant Combat Hero Ping Taixin
    The battle at the southeast railway station had just ended, and it was discovered that a group of enemies was fleeing from northeast to southwest along the highway. Ping Taixin, the squad leader of the first squad of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, accepted the task of ambushing the enemy. At this time, it was already past midnight. Ping Taixin deployed all his brothers on the west side of the highway, and then led the deputy squad leader and the machine gunner to detour to the right front of the enemy's advance, ambushing on a small earth slope next to a stone bridge.
    The enemy was getting closer and closer. Jeeps first crossed the bridge. Ping Taixin and his comrades gave them a head-on blow from a high position, and the enemy vehicle was immediately destroyed. Three armored vehicles were frightened and stopped at the north end of the bridge, blocking the passage of the tanks and trucks behind. At this time, Ping Taixin picked up his submachine gun and waded through the knee-deep river in one breath, pounced on the north bank of the river, and threw three grenades at the bridgehead in a row. The grenades immediately exploded on the first armored vehicle, followed by explosions on the second and third armored vehicles. The enemies in the vehicles began to panic, some jumping down from above, and some climbing up from below. Ping Taixin stuck to the outside of the bridge railing, steadily raised his submachine gun, and shot and killed more than thirty American devils one after another. The impetuous enemies blindly bombarded the surroundings, and the tanks roared. Seeing that the enemies were about to escape, Ping Taixin felt the bullets on his body, and there were not many left. "What should I do?" "We must not let the enemy run away in vain!" Ping Taixin thought of the tank-busting bomb carried by the deputy squad leader. He decided to fetch it from the south bank of the river and destroy the enemy's first tank. At this time, he realized that the cotton coat soaked in the river water had frozen into a thick armor. But when he thought of his great motherland and the disaster-stricken Korean people, he immediately bravely climbed over the river and climbed back again. When he buckled the fuse and was about to pounce on the first tank, he suddenly thought again: "Destroying a tank will not stop the enemy from escaping." So, he climbed to the bottom of the bridge again, stepped on the submachine gun, climbed up the bridge pier, and stuffed the bomb into the stone crevice at the top of the bridge. He gritted his teeth and the fuse was broken. In the four or five seconds of the gap, he somersaulted down, picked up his submachine gun, dodged four or five meters, and squatted into the water. A flash of fire was seen, and with a "rumble," the bridge collapsed, and a plume of smoke shot into the night sky. All the enemies began to panic and jumped out of the vehicles to escape. At this time, reinforcements had attacked from the north, and the machine gun positions that Ping Taixin had already arranged echoed each other from left and right. In the chaotic enemy ranks, it was a dense net of fire woven by our army.
    At dawn, the battle ended. Preliminary investigation of the results of the battle revealed the capture of two tanks, three armored vehicles, forty-two trucks, eight howitzers, twelve rocket launchers, eight light and heavy machine guns, and two hundred and twenty-five rifles and carbines. In this battle, the resourceful and valiant Ping Taixin was awarded a special merit and won the glorious title of "Combat Hero." The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea specially awarded him the Third-Class National Flag Medal and Military Merit Medal. (Attached picture)

    机智英勇的战斗英雄平太信
    东南面车站的战斗刚刚结束，发现有一股敌人沿公路从东北往西南逃窜。志愿军某部第一班班长平太信接受了伏击敌人的任务。这时，已经是夜十二时以后了。平太信把全班的弟兄部署到公路西侧，然后带领副班长和机枪射手，迂回到敌人行进的右前方，埋伏在一座石桥旁边的小土坡上。
    敌人愈来愈近了，吉普车首先穿过了桥梁，平太信和他的战友们，居高临下，给了它一个迎头痛击，敌车立刻遭到了破坏。三辆装甲车被吓得在桥北头上停下来，挡住了后面的坦克和卡车的通路。这时，平太信提起冲锋枪，一口气淌过半人深的河水，扑向河的北岸，一连向桥头扔过去三颗手榴弹。手榴弹立刻在第一辆装甲车上爆炸了，接着，在第二辆、第三辆装甲车上也开了花。车上的敌人开始混乱了，有的从上往下跳，有的又从下往上爬，平太信贴在桥栏外边，稳稳地举起他的冲锋枪，一枪一个，一连打死了三十多个美国鬼子。暴躁的敌人盲目地向周围轰击，坦克车在呜呜地吼叫，眼看敌人要逃走了。这时，平太信摸了摸身上的子弹，已经剩的不多了。“怎么办呢？”“决不能让敌人白白地跑了！”平太信一转念，想起了副班长带的那个炸坦克的炸弹。他决定到河南岸把它取来，炸毁敌人的第一辆坦克。这个时候，他才发觉被河水浸透了的棉衣，已经冻结得像一身厚厚的铁甲。但是，当他想起自己伟大的祖国和灾难深重的朝鲜人民，他立刻勇敢地爬过河去，又爬了回来。当他扣住导火索，要扑向第一辆坦克的时候，忽然又想道：“炸毁一辆坦克，还是阻挡不住敌人的逃跑。”于是，他又爬到桥底下，踏着冲锋枪，攀沿上桥墩，把炸弹塞到桥顶的石缝里。他一咬牙，导火索被拉断了，他在这四五秒钟的空隙里，翻身跳下，提起冲锋枪，闪开四五公尺，蹲到水里去。只见火光一闪，“轰隆”一声，桥坍了，一股烟柱冲上了夜空，全部的敌人开始混乱了，纷纷跳车逃命。这时，援军已从北面攻来，和平太信早已布置好了的机枪阵地，左右呼应，在混乱的敌人队伍中，正是我军织成的一片密集的火网。
    黎明的时候，战斗结束了。初步清查战果，缴获了坦克两辆，装甲车三辆，卡车四十二辆，榴弹炮八门，火箭炮十二门，轻重机枪八挺，长短步枪二百二十五支。在这次战斗中机智英勇的平太信，荣立特功一次，并获得了“战斗英雄”的光荣称号。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府特授予三级国旗勋章和军功章。（附图片）
