    Everything for the Great Motherland
    Industrial Labor Model Su Changyou
    The year the Northeast was liberated, I was living in Kaiyuan. During the land reform, my family was allocated a nice one-and-a-half room house and a vegetable garden. When I participated in construction work at the Benxi Lake Coal and Iron Company, no one scolded or beat me while I worked, and the factory directly paid my wages; I had never seen this happen since I was a child. At first, I felt that the People's Government was too good. When I saw workmates being lazy on the job, I would say: We must work conscientiously; there are no foremen to scold or beat us, so it's not right to be lazy! One day, I was working on the site and saw many workmates with the words "Labor Model" written on their vests. Later, they told me that this was awarded by Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, mainly because they worked well; and they said that if they won the Labor Model award several times in a row, they could even see Chairman Mao! When I heard that I could see Chairman Mao, I was so happy! In June 1950, the factory signed a contract with us to create new records. I immediately participated and won eleven consecutive new record awards. I realized even more deeply that in a country under the leadership of Chairman Mao, people who work hard are the most respected. I was elected by my workmates to be a member of the factory management committee. It was something I had never heard of my ancestors, that the factory would discuss matters with the workers. Why wouldn't I love such a country! From then on, I worked even more carefully. Even when I was sleeping, I was thinking: Don't waste our national property on the site!

    In the autumn of the same year, I moved to Harbin. I also heard a report from Engineer Deng of the flax factory. He introduced us to the advanced Soviet experience - the three-section bricklaying method. Back in the dormitory, everyone discussed it. Many old workers said: What is the advanced Soviet experience? We've been doing this for decades, and our skills can't compare to the advanced Soviet experience? I thought, that's not right. I often watch Soviet movies, and their building construction is all electrified, it must be better than our technology. Besides, the Soviet people suffered a lot when fighting Fascist Germany; in just a few years, they have improved their lives again. If their technology wasn't good, could they have done this great thing? I also thought: Our China, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, has also undergone great changes in the past two years. The workers have become masters of the country. When workers do a project, even if there are few people, the work efficiency is particularly high. Trains are on time, and there are no accidents. Women with children on the train receive special care. Conductors also help passengers write and mail letters. There are many more things like this, which never existed in the old China. I not only want to love such a country, but I should also build it and make it as good as the Soviet Union. I decided to take the lead in learning from the advanced Soviet experience.

    At that time, it happened that a project was assigned to our team. For the first few days after construction started, everyone was still using the old techniques. In addition, apprentices made up one-third of the team, which resulted in failure to even meet the work quota. The skilled workers were the first to raise objections; they were afraid of affecting their wage income and were unwilling to teach the apprentices their skills. I thought, this won't do! Our country's economic construction is developing so rapidly, and we need to build more factories. If everyone is unwilling to teach apprentices their skills, where will the country find so many workers to build factories in the future? Besides, Soviet experts have come all the way from afar with advanced experience to help our economic construction, what is their purpose? We are Chinese, and we forget about national construction because of a little bit of wages, that's not right! At that time, I first took an apprentice to the site and conducted experimental work according to the Soviet three-section bricklaying method experience. I laid the outer and inner skins myself, and the apprentice filled the core and grouted. The results of the experiment showed that the two of us laid 3,500 bricks in four hours. Usually, a skilled worker working nine hours could not even meet the quota of 1,200 bricks. The skilled workers praised us, saying: It's fast and the quality is good. The apprentice who worked with me also said: I'm very comfortable doing the grouting and filling work, and I have confidence, and I don't have to worry about rework anymore. A few days later, I visited the flax factory again. They said that because the technical skills of Chinese construction workers are low, they are not very efficient in learning the three-section bricklaying method. Based on their feedback, I returned to the site and studied our actual working conditions, changing the Soviet three-section bricklaying method from five people to four, and carried out a division of labor. I laid the outer skin, another skilled worker laid the inner skin, one apprentice placed the bricks and mixed the mortar, and one apprentice filled the core and grouted. This time, the results were even greater! The average for the four people exceeded the quota by more than 50%.

    As production increased, the wages of the workmates also increased, and they all happily taught their apprentices. This further improved my thinking. I realized that only by improving production efficiency can the country become rich and strong, and the lives of the people across the country can be improved. The interests of the country and the interests of the individual are consistent. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the cultivation of the Communist Party, I understood how to love my motherland. We, the working class, have the most promising future, and we see the furthest. In order to defend and build the motherland, I will actively study in the future, and on the basis of ensuring quality, further improve technology in the building tasks of 1952. In particular, I must humbly learn from the Soviet Union, save more labor for the country, create more wealth, and lay a good foundation for the realization of a communist society in China!

    一切为了伟大的祖国
    工业劳动模范  苏长有
    东北解放那年，我在开原住。在土地改革的时候，我家分到了一间半漂亮的房子和一个菜园子。在本溪湖煤铁公司参加建筑工作时，干活也没人打骂了，工资直接由厂方发给；这是我从小所没看见过的事。开始，我就感觉到人民政府太好了。看到吊儿郎当干活的工友，我就说：咱们干活要凭良心，没有把头打骂了，再吊儿浪当的可不对劲啦！有一天，我正在现场干活，看见好多工友的背心上写着“劳模”两字，后来他们告诉我说，这是东北人民政府林枫副主席奖给的，主要是因为他们劳动好；并且说，要连得几次劳动模范奖时，还能见毛主席呢！我一听说能见毛主席，心里可高兴啦！一九五零年六月，厂方和我们订了创新纪录的合同。我马上参加了，连得十一次创新纪录奖励。我更深刻地体会到，在毛主席领导下的国家，好好劳动的人，是最受人尊敬的。我被工友们选举当上了工厂管理委员会的委员。工厂有事和工人商量，这是我从祖辈上没听说过的事。这样的国家，我为啥不爱呢！从此，我干活就更仔细啦。睡觉也想着：现场可别浪费咱们国家财产哪！
    同年秋季，迁到哈尔滨。又听到亚麻工厂邓工程师的报告。他向我们介绍了苏联的先进经验——三段砌砖法。回到宿舍，大家就进行了讨论。许多老工友都说：什么叫苏联先进经验？我们耍了好几十年手艺还顶不上苏联先进经验？我一想，不对。我常看苏联电影，人家建筑房屋都电气化啦，一定比咱技术强。再说，苏联人民跟法西斯德国打仗的时候，生活都很苦；几年的工夫，人家又把生活过好了。要是技术不好，这件大事能办得到吗？我又想起：咱们中国在毛主席英明领导下，两年来也有了很大变化。工人做了国家的主人。工人做一件工程，别看人少，工作效率特别高。火车不误点，事故也不出。坐火车带小孩的妇女，受到特别照顾。车长还帮助旅客写信寄信。还有好多，这都是旧中国从来没有过的事。这样的国家，我不光要爱她，还应该建设她，要把她建设得和苏联一样。我就决定要带头学习苏联先进经验。
    那时，恰好有个工程分到我们班里。开工头几天，大夥还用老一套技术工作。再加上徒工占三分之一，结果使工率定额都没有达到。技术工首先提出意见，他们怕影响自己工资收入，不愿教徒工技术了。我一想，这那能成？咱们国家的经济建设发展得这样快，很需要盖更多的厂房。要是都不愿意教徒工技术，往后国家盖工厂可往哪找那麽多工人去？再说，人家苏联专家带着先进经验从老远的地方来到咱中国，帮助咱们经济建设，为的是啥呢？咱们是中国人，因一点工资就把国家建设都忘了，这可不对劲啦！当时，我就首先带着一个徒工下现场，按着苏联三段砌砖法经验进行试验工作。我自己砌里外皮，徒工填饀带灌浆。试验结果，两人干了四小时就砌了三千五百块砖。平常一个技工干九小时工作，连一千二百块砖的定额都达不到。技工们看了都称赞着说：活又快，质量又好。跟我干活的徒工也说：我干灌浆填饀活计挺顺手，心里也有底，再不用怕活返工啦。隔几天，我又到亚麻工厂参观了一次。他们说，因为中国建筑工人技术低，学会三段砌砖法效率还不高。我根据他们的反映，回现场又研究了我们的实际工作情况，把苏联的三段砌砖法从五个人改成四个，进行了一次分工。我砌外皮，另个技工砌里皮，一个徒工摆砖搓灰，一个徒工填饀灌浆。这一下子成绩更大啦！四个人平均超过定额百分之五十以上。
    随着生产的提高，工友们的工资也提高了，也都欢欢喜喜地来教徒弟了。这么一来，又把我思想提高了一步。我认识到了：只有提高生产效率，国家富强起来，全国人民的生活才能改善。国家利益和个人利益是一致的。在毛主席的英明领导和共产党的培养下，我懂得了应该怎样来热爱自己的祖国。我们工人阶级是最有前途的，眼光也看得最远。为了保卫和建设祖国，我今后更要积极钻研，要把一九五二年的建筑任务在保证质量的基础上使技术再进一步提高。特别是更要虚心地向苏联学习，给国家节省出更多的劳动力，创造更多的财富，为在中国实现共产主义社会打下良好基础！
