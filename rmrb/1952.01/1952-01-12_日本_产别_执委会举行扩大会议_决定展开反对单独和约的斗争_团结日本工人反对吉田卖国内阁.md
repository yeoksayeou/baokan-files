Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th—The All-Japan Congress of Industrial Organizations (abbreviated as "Sanbetsu") held an enlarged meeting of its Executive Committee in Tokyo on December 5th and 6th of last year. Approximately 80 representatives from various industrial unions and local labor organizations attended the meeting. The meeting affirmed that, with the San Francisco "Peace Treaty" placing Japan in the state of a veritable colonial dependency, the Japanese labor movement possesses the fundamental nature of a colonial dependency liberation struggle. The meeting decided that "Sanbetsu's" basic policy is: to struggle for the unified action of all workers with the basic goals of improving workers' lives and defending workers' freedom; at the same time, to unite all the people in a national united front based on the worker-peasant alliance. The meeting passed resolutions on overthrowing the Yoshida Cabinet, which signed the separate peace treaty and the US-Japan "Security Treaty," demanding the dissolution of the Diet that ratified these two treaties, and on crushing fascist laws such as the "Prohibition of General Strike Law" and the "Group Control Regulation Law." The meeting also resolved to demand the release of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." The meeting also decided to send greetings to the trade unions of China and Korea, as well as the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    【新华社十一日讯】东京消息：全日本产业别工会会议（简称“产别”）于去年十二月五日和六日在东京举行了“产别”执行委员会扩大会议。出席会议的有各产业工会和地方工会组织的代表约八十人。会议确认，在旧金山“和约”把日本置于名副其实的殖民地附属国的状态下，日本的劳工运动具有殖民地附属国解放斗争的基本性质。会议决定“产别”的基本方针是：以改善劳工生活、保卫劳工自由为基本目标，为统一全体工人的行动而斗争；同时，以工农联盟为基础，将全体人民团结在民族统一战线中。会议通过了关于打倒在单独和约和美日“安全条约”上签字的吉田内阁、要求解散批准这两个条约的国会的决议，以及关于粉碎“禁止总罢工法”、“团体等规正法”等法西斯法令的决议。会议也决议要求释放“松川事件”的无辜被告。会议并决定向中国和朝鲜的工会以及世界工会联合会致敬。
