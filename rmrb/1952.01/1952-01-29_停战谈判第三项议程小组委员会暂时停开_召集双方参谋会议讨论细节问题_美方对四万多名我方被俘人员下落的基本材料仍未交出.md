Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 26th: At the 26th of January Korean armistice negotiations Third Agenda Subcommittee meeting, our side pointed out that our side's January 9th proposal had fully and reasonably resolved the differences between the two sides. In our side's January 9th proposal, we agreed to the other side's repeated demands for the replacement of military equipment during the armistice within a reasonable scope, and we also proposed that neither side should bring any reinforcing military forces, including combat aircraft, into Korea from outside Korea during the armistice, which guaranteed that neither side would increase its air force strength in Korea during the armistice. However, the other side still insisted on interfering with our right to handle airport equipment within Korea, attempting to interfere in our internal affairs. Our side's representative pointed out that the other side's proposal to convene a staff meeting on the 25th was only a proposal to change the procedural rules, and our side was considering it. However, no matter how the procedural rules change, the responsibility for obstructing the progress of the meeting and preventing the third agenda from reaching a principled agreement so far must be borne entirely by the other side.

At the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee meeting, the other side had not yet submitted the basic information on our captured personnel that should have been submitted long ago, and shamelessly denied that it had captured hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians from our area during the war. Our side's representative sternly condemned the other side's shameless lies, pointing out that during the retreat to the south, the other side used the threat of using atomic bombs against our area to intimidate our people to move south, and carried out indiscriminate bombing along the way, with the bridge over the Taedong River alone being piled with the corpses of our people. The other side has every responsibility to return the civilians from our side who were abducted by such barbaric and shameless means. The other side has every responsibility to quickly submit all the basic information on our captured personnel.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 27th: Since our side's representative put forward a comprehensive principle proposal for resolving the third agenda at the Korean armistice negotiations Third Agenda Subcommittee meeting on January 9th, the differences between the two sides have been completely and reasonably resolved, but the other side still insisted on interfering with our right to handle airport equipment within Korea, attempting to interfere in our internal affairs. On the 25th, the other side's representative proposed convening a staff meeting between the two sides to discuss specific details, while leaving the so-called airport issue for later discussion. Our side's representative pointed out at the 27th Subcommittee meeting: "Our side believes that the airport issue does not exist. The clause we have proposed that neither side shall bring any reinforcing military forces, including combat aircraft, into Korea from outside Korea has already guaranteed that neither side will increase or concentrate air force capabilities during the armistice. As for the construction of any equipment within Korea, it is entirely within the scope of internal affairs and you have no right to interfere. Therefore, our side suggests temporarily suspending the Subcommittee meeting and convening a staff meeting between the two sides to discuss the details based on the principles of the agreement already reached in the third agenda. As soon as the staff meeting reaches an agreement on the details and submits it to the Subcommittee meeting, the Subcommittee will resume."

The first staff meeting between the two sides was held in the morning of the 27th after the Subcommittee meeting and is scheduled to continue at 11:00 a.m. on the 28th.

At the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee meeting, the other side's representative proposed an adjournment to 11:00 a.m. on the 28th shortly after the meeting began. Our side's representative reiterated our firm position on the unconditional release and repatriation of all prisoners of war held by both sides, and the meeting lasted only five minutes.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 28th: At the Korean armistice negotiations Fourth Agenda Subcommittee meeting on the 28th, the other side submitted the basic information on the rank and department of our captured personnel, but the other side still has not submitted the information on the whereabouts of 44,205 of our captured personnel. Our side's representative pointed out at the meeting that the unconditional release and repatriation of all prisoners of war held by both sides after the armistice is our unwavering position. In order to reasonably resolve the fourth agenda, the other side must abandon its unreasonable claim to detain our prisoners of war in the name of voluntary repatriation.

The third agenda staff meeting between the two sides, originally scheduled to be held on the 28th, was postponed to 11:00 a.m. on the 29th.

    停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会暂时停开
    召集双方参谋会议讨论细节问题
    美方对四万多名我方被俘人员下落的基本材料仍未交出
    【新华社开城二十六日电】二十六日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会上，我方代表指出，我方一月九日的方案已经充分而合理地解决了双方之间的分歧。我方在一月九日的方案中，在合理范围内同意了对方所一再坚持的停战期间军事装备的替换的要求，我方也提出了双方不得在停战期间自朝鲜境外进入任何增援的军事力量，包括作战飞机在内的建议，也就是保证了双方在停战期间，不在朝鲜增加空军力量。但对方却仍然坚持干涉我方处理朝鲜境内机场设备的权利，妄图干涉我方的内政。我方代表指出对方二十五日召开参谋人员会议的提案，只是关于变更议事程序的提案，我方在考虑中。但不管议事程序如何变化，障碍会议进展，使第三项议程至今未能获得原则协议的责任，必须由对方全部负担。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方尚未交来早应交来的我方被俘人员的基本材料，并无耻地否认在战争期间，曾从我方地区俘去数十万无辜平民。我方代表严词痛斥对方这种无耻的谎言，指出对方在向南撤退中，曾用对我区使用原子弹的恐吓威胁我方的老百姓，以向南移迁，并在沿途狂轰滥炸，只在大同江的桥上，就曾经堆满了我方老百姓的尸体。对方有一切的责任，遣还用这种野蛮无耻的手段掳去的我方平民。对方更有一切的责任，迅速交来我方被俘人员的全部基本材料。
    【新华社开城二十七日电】自从一月九日我方代表在朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，提出了解决第三项议程的全部原则建议后，双方之间的分歧本已取得了完全合理的解决，但对方却仍然坚持干涉我方处理朝鲜境内机场设备的权利，妄图干涉我方内政。二十五日对方代表提议召开双方参谋会议，讨论具体细节，而将所谓机场问题留待以后讨论，我方代表在二十七日的小组委员会上指出：“机场问题我方认为并不存在，我方已提出的双方不得从朝鲜境外进入任何增援的军事力量，包括作战飞机的条文，就已经保证双方不在停战期间增加和集结空军能力。至于朝鲜境内任何设备的修建，则完全属于内政范围，你方无权过问。因此，我方建议暂时停开小组委员会会议，而召集双方参谋会议，讨论以第三项议程中业已达成的协议的原则为基础的细节问题。一俟参谋会议就细节问题取得协议并提交小组委员会会议时，小组会即行复会”。
    第一次双方参谋会议在二十七日上午小组委员会后召开，预定在二十八日上午十一时继续举行。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方代表在会议开始后不久即行提出休会至二十八日上午十一时的建议，我方代表重申我方的无条件释放与遣送双方收容的全体战俘的不可动摇的立场，会议历时仅五分钟。
    【新华社开城二十八日电】二十八日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方交来我方被俘人员级别与部别的基本材料，但四万四千二百零五名我方被俘人员下落的材料对方仍未交出。我方代表在会议上指出停战后双方无条件释放并遣返其所收容的全部战俘，乃我方不可动摇的立场。为合理解决第四项议程，对方必须放弃其以志愿遣送为名而企图扣留我方战俘的不合理主张。
    原定于二十八日召开的第三项议程双方参谋会议，延期至二十九日上午十一时举行。
