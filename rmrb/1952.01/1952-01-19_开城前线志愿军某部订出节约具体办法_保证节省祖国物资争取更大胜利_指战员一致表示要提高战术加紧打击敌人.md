Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 18th -- A certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Kaesong front is enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing strict economy. Commanders and combatants of the unit held forums during lulls in the fighting to discuss specific ways to save national resources. Commanders guaranteed to improve command skills and achieve greater victories with less cost. Combatants guaranteed to improve tactics and techniques and shoot at the enemy with 100% accuracy. In one instance, during a coordinated infantry operation, the Second Artillery Company had a gun that missed the target with four shells because it was not aimed accurately. The gunners of the gun examined themselves at the meeting and said, "How much RMB is a shell worth? We were too careless and wasted four shells of the people of the motherland." They proposed that gunners should be more careful when aiming, and that cadres at all levels should thoroughly check the preparation work. In the next battle, all the shells they fired hit the target, not only destroying enemy fortifications but also killing and wounding a large number of enemies, and thus the collective was awarded a third-class merit. In addition to accurate shooting, infantry soldiers also paid attention to collecting the enemy's combat equipment. When on patrol, soldier Wu Shangqin dismantled and collected more than ten li of the enemy's telephone lines. On another occasion, he discovered a large number of enemy ammunition and guns buried under a mountain ridge, including a heavy machine gun, three 60mm mortars, 2,752 shells of various types, 26 boxes of explosives, more than 1,000 grenades, three boxes of fuses, and many other military supplies. After these weapons and ammunition were unearthed, they were used the next day to attack the enemies advancing near Panmunjom. For this, the unit leader awarded Wu Shangqin a second-class merit.

During the movement to practice strict economy, commanders and combatants also came up with many ways to save resources. To save lamp oil, soldiers in many companies used burning pine branches instead of lamps when repairing fortifications at night. Squad leader Yang Jichang used an old mirror to make a reflector, reflecting sunlight into the bunker to increase the brightness and save lamp oil. Soldiers of the anti-aircraft machine gun company made paper candles from the wax paper used to wrap bullets, each of which could burn for four hours. Many people mended their old coats and wore them again in order to save new coats. Soldiers also used the lulls in combat to chop firewood and burn charcoal to save the grass and wood issued by the public. Han Fuyou, the squad leader of the Sixth Company's artillery squad, created a simple small charcoal kiln that could burn 40 jin of charcoal per day. As a result of implementing these conservation measures, the unit estimated that it could save 1.5 billion RMB this winter, equivalent to the value of a fighter plane. The conservation movement is now being carried out more widely and deeply in the front-line Volunteer Army units.

    开城前线志愿军某部订出节约具体办法
    保证节省祖国物资争取更大胜利
    指战员一致表示要提高战术加紧打击敌人
    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】开城前线志愿军某部热烈响应毛主席关于增加生产厉行节约的号召。该部指挥员和战斗员们在战斗的空隙举行座谈会，讨论节省祖国物资的具体办法。指挥员保证提高指挥艺术，用更少的代价取得更大的胜利。战斗员保证提高战术技术，百发百中地射击敌人。该部炮兵第二连一次在配合步兵作战中，有一门炮因为瞄得不准，四发炮弹没有命中目标。这门炮的炮手们在会上检讨说：“一发炮弹要值多少人民币，我们太粗心大意，一下就给祖国人民浪费了四发。”他们提出炮手在瞄准时要细心再细心，各级干部要彻底检查准备工作。在下一次战斗中，他们发射的炮弹全部命中了目标，不仅摧毁了敌人工事，而且杀伤了大量敌人，因而集体立了一次三等功。步兵战士们除做到准确射击外，并注意搜集敌人的战斗器材。战士吴尚勤在放游动哨时拆收了十多里长的敌人电话线。另一次他又在一座山岭下发现敌人埋藏的大批弹药枪枝，计有重机枪一挺、六零炮三门、各种炮弹二千七百五十二发、炸药二十六箱、手榴弹一千多枚、引信三箱和许多其它军用品。这些武器弹药被掘出后，在第二天就用来打击了向板门店附近进犯的敌人。为此，该部首长特给吴尚勤记了一次二等功。
    在厉行节约的运动中，指挥员战斗员们还想出了很多节约物资的办法。许多连队的战士在夜间加修工事时，为了节省灯油，用燃松树枝代替灯。班长杨吉昌用旧镜子做了一具反光镜，将太阳光反射到掩蔽部里增强光亮，节省灯油。高射机枪连的战士们用包子弹的蜡纸做成纸烛，每枝可燃四小时。很多人为了节约新大衣，把旧大衣缝补好再穿。战士们还利用战斗空隙砍柴和烧木炭，以节约公家发的草料和木材。六连炮班班长韩福有创造了一种简便的小型烧炭窑，该窑每天可以烧炭四十斤。由于实行了这种节约办法，该部估计在这个冬季中可节约人民币十五亿元，等于一架战斗机的价值。现在节约运动正在前线志愿军部队中更广泛而深入地展开。
