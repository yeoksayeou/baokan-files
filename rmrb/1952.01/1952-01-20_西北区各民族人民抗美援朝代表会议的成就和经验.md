    The Northwest District People's Representative Conference for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea was held from December 12th to 19th last year. There were 451 representatives from 14 ethnic groups and more than 20 different professions and beliefs attending the conference. The meeting was very good and very successful. It truly achieved the purpose of promoting the people's patriotic spirit, reviewing the achievements of the past year's work in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and mobilizing the people to respond to Chairman Mao's call to increase production and practice economy and continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. In addition to summarizing the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in various parts of the Northwest in the past year, discussing and adopting the decision to continue strengthening the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and formally establishing the Northwest General Sub-Branch of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Association, the conference also specifically stipulated that within three months around the Spring Festival, factories and rural grassroots organizations in various places should universally hold a mobilization meeting for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and carrying out the patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy, universally conduct a review of preferential treatment work, and universally review and establish patriotic pacts with the main contents of increasing production and practicing economy and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers.

    The conference maintained a full spirit from beginning to end. Ninety-six representatives spoke at the meeting, and the speeches were able to grasp the central point. The speeches of the workers, farmers, and working women representatives gave the attendees a deep impression. Especially when the representatives of the wounded and sick volunteers mentioned in their speeches that the already disabled wounded soldiers were bravely striving to study, participate in production, and continue to fight for the motherland, many representatives were moved to tears. Chairman Mao's reply telegram to the Northwest Nationalities People's Representative Conference for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea on December 12th gave the representatives great encouragement. Groups and individuals wrote 40 letters of determination and made their own production increase and economy plans. Challenges were launched among worker and farmer representatives. Representatives of fraternal nationalities expressed that they would do a better job in national unity and ensure the realization of Chairman Mao's instructions. Nuns, Taoists, and lamas also made patriotic plans. The conference started with the introduction of experiences and finally formed a mobilization meeting to carry out the patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy and continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Before the meeting, representatives from Xinjiang and Qinghai hoped to visit various parts of the country. After the meeting, they automatically requested not to visit in order to save money and immediately return to work.

    The Northwest District's People's Representative Conference for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea has the following experiences:

    First, the representatives must have a wide range of mass character and truly come from the masses in all aspects. Half of the representatives at this conference were model figures who emerged from the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in the Northwest District in the past year. They brought many vivid experiences. Therefore, through this conference, the work experience of various regions and various aspects was exchanged.

    Second, organizing universal speeches at the conference and using vivid examples created by the masses to educate the masses is a good method of self-education for the masses. The leadership work of the conference focused on organizing conference speeches, exchanging experiences with each other, and achieving remarkable results. In organizing speeches, the method of interspersing workers, farmers, soldiers, and representatives of democratic parties and teachers was adopted. In contrast, the speeches of the worker, farmer, and soldier laboring people representatives were vivid and wonderful. Everyone unanimously realized that the thoughts and feelings of the laboring people were so firm, clear, and consistent, and therefore received great education.

    Third, to hold such a meeting well, there must be full preparations beforehand, and a strong ideological and organizational leadership must be established during the meeting. Before the Northwest District convened this meeting, all provinces and cities except Xinjiang held representative meetings for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. During the meeting, the presidium of the conference held a leadership liaison meeting every day. The important report of the conference was prepared in advance. Most of the representatives' speeches were also fully prepared in advance. Therefore, the conference was guaranteed to be completed smoothly and on time.

    Fourth, holding such a mass representative meeting including all aspects on a regular basis is one of the methods for leading organs to contact the masses, learn from the masses, and check the work situation. Before this conference, the Northwest District leading organs' understanding of the entire district's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in the past year was incomplete, and the estimate of the people's political consciousness after the three major movements of the Liberation War and the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and land reform was also insufficient. Only after this meeting did they truly experience the rapid progress of the people. For example, in the campaign to donate weapons, the Northwest General Sub-Branch of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Association initially had no confidence in whether it could complete the 50 billion yuan plan, but as a result, by mid-December of last year, the people had already paid more than 180 billion yuan. The Northwest region is vast, and it would be very difficult for the leading organs to universally inspect and check the work in various places. Therefore, it is very necessary to convene such a meeting once a year. (Xi'an Communication)

    西北区各民族人民抗美援朝代表会议的成就和经验
    西北区各民族人民抗美援朝代表会议是在去年十二月十二日到十九日举行的。出席会议的有十四个民族、二十余种不同职业和不同信仰的代表四百五十一人。会议开得很好，很成功，真正达到了发扬人民爱国精神，检阅一年来抗美援朝各项工作的成就，动员人民响应毛主席关于增产节约、继续加强抗美援朝工作的号召的目的。会议除总结了西北各地一年来抗美援朝工作，讨论和通过了继续加强抗美援朝工作的决定，正式成立西北抗美援朝总分会之外，并且具体规定在春节前后三个月内，各地工厂、农村基层组织普遍召开一次抗美援朝、开展爱国增产节约运动的动员大会，普遍检查一次优抚工作，普遍检查和订立以增产节约、优抚烈属军属为主要内容的爱国公约。
    这次会议，自始至终保持着饱满的情绪。出席会议的代表有九十六人在会上讲了话，讲话的都能抓住中心。工人、农民及劳动妇女代表的讲话，给到会人员以很深的感动。特别是当志愿军伤员代表在讲话中提到已经残废的伤员们，奋不顾身地努力学习、参加生产，继续为祖国奋斗的情景时，许多代表都感动得流了眼泪。毛主席十二月十二日给西北各族人民抗美援朝代表会议的复电，给了代表们以莫大的鼓舞。团体及个人写了四十封决心书，订了自己的增产节约计划；在工、农代表中展开了挑战；兄弟民族代表表示要更加作好民族团结工作，保证实现毛主席的指示；尼姑、道士和喇嘛也都订了爱国计划。会议从介绍经验开始，最后形成了开展爱国增产节约运动、继续加强抗美援朝工作的动员大会。会前，新疆、青海代表希望能去全国各地参观，会后都自动要求为了节约不去参观，立即回去工作。
    西北区这次召开的各民族人民抗美援朝代表会议有如下几点经验：
    第一，代表必须具有广泛的群众性，真正是从各个方面的群众中来的。这次会议的代表有一半是在西北区各民族一年来抗美援朝工作中涌现的模范人物，他们带来了许多生动的经验。因此，经过这次会议，交流了各地区各方面的工作经验。
    第二，在大会上组织普遍发言，以群众创造的生动范例来教育群众，是群众自我教育的很好方法。大会的领导工作以组织大会发言为主，互相交流经验，收效显著。在组织发言中，采取工人、农民、军人与各民主党派、教师等互相参杂的方式进行。相形之下，工、农、兵劳动人民代表的发言，有血有肉，十分精彩，大家一致体会到劳动人民的思想和感情，如此坚定、明确与表里一致，因而受到很大教育。
    第三，要开好这样的会议，事先要有充分的准备，会中要建立强有力的思想领导与组织领导。西北区在召开这次会议前，除新疆外，各省市都开了抗美援朝代表会议。在会议进行中，大会主席团每日举行领导接头会。大会的重要报告是事先准备好的。代表的发言大部分也在事先作了充分准备。因此，保证了大会顺利地按时完成。
    第四，定时召开此种包括各方面的群众代表会议，是领导机关联系群众、向群众学习、检查工作情况的方法之一。在此次会议前，西北区领导机关对全区一年来抗美援朝运动的了解是不全面的，对于人民群众经过解放战争和抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革三大运动后政治觉悟提高的估计也不足。开了这次会，才真正体验到人民群众的迅速进步。例如在捐献武器运动中，西北抗美援朝总分会最初对于是否能完成五百亿元的计划没有信心，但结果到去年十二月中旬，人民群众即已缴款一千八百余亿元。西北地区辽阔，领导机关普遍巡视和检查各地工作会有很多的困难，因此一年一度召集此种会议，是很有必要的。（西安通讯）
