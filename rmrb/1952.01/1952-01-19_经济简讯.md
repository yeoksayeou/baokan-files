Economic Briefs

    ▲The first team of the Guoqing Brigade of the state-owned Huainan Coal Mine, which implemented the new coal mining method, received strong cooperation from the underground transport workers. On December 24th of last year, they set a new national record of 18.194 tons of coal mined per worker on average at the workface in one day. On that day, 36 employees of the team mined 655 tons of medium-hard coal and supported 528 props at the inclined full-filling new coal mining method site. The average efficiency per worker reached 18.194 tons, exceeding the national record (11.851 tons) created on April 26th of last year by more than 53%.
    ▲The Ma Liuhai tunneling team of the state-owned Datong Coal Mine accumulated wealth equivalent to more than 186,000 jin of millet for the country during the increased production and conservation campaign in the fourth quarter of last year. According to statistics from December 25th of last year, the Ma Liuhai tunneling team had completed 153.33% of the task assigned for November and December, saving 8.35% in explosives and 7.31% in detonators. They guarantee to tunnel 500 meters per month this year and save at least 3% in material consumption each month.
    ▲The increased production and conservation campaign has rapidly unfolded in the Pingxiang Coal Mine. This campaign started with the creation of a new record in pneumatic pick coal mining on November 29th of last year and quickly developed to hand pick coal mining, rock tunnel excavation, coal transportation, roof caving and material extraction (using artificial means to collapse the roof and recover pit props) and power generation work units. Within a month, the entire mine saw the emergence of new records more than 150 times, each higher than the last. For example, hand pick coal miner Guo Qingsi mined 79 tons of coal in one shift, and the Shimen Iron and Steel Team excavated 20.3 meters of rock tunnel in one day and night, both of which are the highest national records. Roof caving workers Liu Songqiao and He Jincheng increased the pit prop recovery rate from the original 10% to more than 30%, which is of great significance for reducing costs.
    ▲Fan Ziming, director of the Second Sulfur Refining Plant under the Shanxi Provincial Mining Bureau, and Li Zhaorong, head of the construction department, improved the sulfur refining furnace, increasing the sulfur extraction rate from 10% to 20%. The Shanxi Provincial Mining Bureau plans to promote the use of this improved new sulfur refining furnace in one-third of the sulfur handicraft production in the province in 1952. This will increase production and save wealth equivalent to 3,006 tons of millet for the country.
    ▲The production of state-owned power plants in the Southwest region increased significantly last year. Comparing the eleven months from January to November of last year with the entire year of the year before, the total power generation of the plants increased by 39%, and the power sales increased by 54%. The average monthly coal consumption of the plants in the eleven months of last year decreased by 10% to 30% compared with the average monthly consumption of the year before, saving a total of 21,522 tons of coal. Line losses and plant power consumption of the plants decreased by more than 8.63 million kilowatt-hours compared with the year before. The equipment utilization rate of the power plants in the Southwest region has also gradually increased. For example, the average equipment utilization rate of the Chongqing power plants has increased from 52% in the year before to 63% in November of last year.
    ▲The local paper, an important handicraft product of Zhejiang Province, has opened up sales channels due to the transformation of production direction and the improvement of quality and specifications. The output in 1951 increased by more than three times compared with 1950, approaching the highest output figure in history. By the end of last year, 70% of the raw materials for superstitious paper in Zhejiang Province were being converted into bamboo pulp for machine-made paper and converted into cultural paper.
    ▲The staff of the first and second power plants of the E'nan Electric Power Company broke with conservative thinking and tapped the potential of machinery and equipment, increasing the output of the two generators by 2,750 kilowatts. The output of one of the generators exceeded the output specified on the nameplate by 300 kilowatts during the test, which was 3,000 kilowatts higher than the usual load before liberation.
    Currently, the workshop teams of the two plants have formulated plans to continue to tap potential capabilities. This plan includes saving fuel coal, electricity, utilizing waste materials, and processing stagnant materials. From processing stagnant materials alone, the first power plant can save the country 1 billion yuan worth of wealth this year.

    经济简讯
    ▲国营淮南煤矿实行新采煤法的国庆大队第一队，得到井下运输工人的有力配合，在去年十二月二十四日再创一天时间内工作面全员平均采煤十八点一九四吨的全国新纪录。那一天，全队三十六名职工在伪倾斜全充填式新采煤法场子上，采出了中硬煤质的煤六百五十五吨，支柱五百二十八根，全员平均效率达到十八点一九四吨，超过了去年四月二十六日所创造的全国纪录（十一点八五一吨）百分之五十三以上。
    ▲国营大同煤矿马六孩掘进组，在去年第四季度的增产节约运动中，为国家积累了十八万六千多斤小米的财富。据去年十二月二十五日的统计，马六孩掘进组已完成十一、十二两个月规定任务百分之
    一百五十三点三三，节省了炮药百分之八点三五，雷管百分之七点三一。他们保证今年每月掘进五百公尺，每月最低节省材料消耗百分之三。
    ▲增产节约运动已在萍乡煤矿迅速展开。这个运动由去年十一月二十九日创造风镐采煤新纪录开始，很快地发展到手镐采煤、石巷掘进、运煤、放顶抽料（用人工使顶板垮下，收回坑木）、发电等工作单位。一个月内，全矿共出现新纪录一百五十多次，一次比一次高。如手镐采煤工人郭清四在一班工作时间内采煤七十九吨和石门钢铁队一昼夜掘进石巷二十点三公尺，都是全国最高纪录。放顶工人刘松桥、何金城把坑木回收率由原来的百分之十提高到百分之三十以上，对降低成本有很大意义。
    ▲山西省矿务管理局所属第二炼磺厂厂长樊子明和工务股长李兆荣等改进炼磺炉，使提磺量由百分之十增加到百分之二十。山西省矿务管理局计划一九五二年在全省三分之一的硫磺手工业生产中，推广使用这种改进后的新炼磺炉，这样可以为国家增产节约价值三千零六吨小米的财富。
    ▲西南区各国营电厂去年生产有显著提高。去年一月到十一月的十一个月和前年全年比较，各厂发电量共增加了百分之三十九，售电量增加了百分之五十四。各厂去年十一个月的每月平均煤耗较前年每月平均数降低百分之十到百分之三十，共节省煤二万一千五百二十二吨。各厂线路损失和厂用电较前年减少了八百六十三万多度。西南各电厂的设备利用率也逐步提高，如重庆各电厂设备的平均利用率已由前年的百分之五十二提高到去年十一月份的百分之六十三。
    ▲浙江省重要手工业产品土纸，由于转变了生产方向，改进了品质和规格，打开了销路。一九五一年产量比一九五○年约增加三倍以上，接近历史上的最高产量数字。到去年年底止，浙江全省有百分之七十的迷信用纸原料正在改制为供机器造纸用的竹浆和改制成文化用纸。
    ▲鄂南电力公司第一、第二两发电厂职工，打破了保守思想，发掘机器设备的潜在能力，使两部发电机的出力增加了二千七百五十瓩。其中一部发电机的出力在试验时，超过名牌规定的出力三百瓩，比解放前经常负荷提高三千瓩。
    目前，两厂的各车间小组已经制订了继续挖掘潜在能力的计划。这一计划，包括了节约燃煤、电力、利用废料和处理呆滞材料等，其中仅就处理呆滞材料一项，第一发电厂今年就可以为国家节约出十亿元的财富。
