    Pay Attention to Cultivating Models of Martyrs' Dependents and Military Dependents and Models of Preferential Treatment Work

    With the strengthening of preferential treatment work, many model figures of martyrs' dependents, military dependents, and disabled revolutionary soldiers have emerged in various places; many model figures who are active and hardworking in preferential treatment work, model preferential treatment groups, model substitute farming groups, model villages, and model units have emerged. Cultivating models of martyrs' dependents, military dependents, and models of preferential treatment work plays an important role in improving the leadership of preferential treatment work. Because if our leading organs can regularly contact a group of representative figures among the dependents of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and preferential treatment workers, we can often hear the opinions of the broad masses of people on preferential treatment work, and we can directly check and understand the actual situation of the implementation of preferential treatment policies at the grassroots level. Strengthening the connection between leading organs and various representative figures in preferential treatment work will allow the wishes, demands, and difficulties of the dependents of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled revolutionary soldiers to be directly reflected to the leading organs. On the one hand, it is convenient to accept their criticisms and suggestions to correct shortcomings in preferential treatment work; on the other hand, it can allow our own leadership work to be checked more deeply by the people, which is very helpful in overcoming bureaucracy in the leadership of preferential treatment work.

    Cultivating models of preferential treatment work is a good education for the people. Models of preferential treatment work have a good influence among the people, which will encourage people to learn from units and individuals that do a good job in preferential treatment work, and urge people to regularly check their own situation and the situation around them in carrying out preferential treatment work. This makes doing a good job in preferential treatment work a kind of public opinion among the masses. Under this circumstance, if anyone is not active in preferential treatment work, they will naturally be supervised and criticized by the masses. Preferential treatment work is a regular and mass-based work. To form a social atmosphere of respecting and caring for the dependents of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, it is necessary to conduct thorough ideological education among the people. Cultivating models in preferential treatment work, and commending and rewarding their deeds, is an important work to ideologically educate and encourage the people to actively participate in preferential treatment work with concrete examples. Paying attention to cultivating models in preferential treatment work can also politically educate and improve the dependents of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled revolutionary soldiers themselves, because in this way they will feel the care of the people's government for themselves, and that their opinions are respected, thereby making them realize their glorious responsibilities and political honor, and thus they will actively participate in production and improve their lives through their own efforts.

    From a national perspective, many places have paid attention to the work of cultivating models in preferential treatment work. The Northeast Region, Hubei Province, and all counties in thirteen provinces (or administrative regions) and some counties in seven provinces have convened model representative conferences of dependents of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, systematically commended models, summarized experiences, and strengthened the connection between leaders and the masses, thereby improving work. However, the leading organs in some areas do not pay enough attention to this work, so the models in preferential treatment work there have not been discovered, their experiences have not been summarized, and their deeds have not been commended, so preferential treatment work cannot get more help from the people, the dependents of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled revolutionary soldiers.

    The Spring Festival is approaching, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government issued instructions on December 11 of last year regarding checking and carrying out preferential treatment work before and after the Spring Festival. All localities should pay attention to the issue of cultivating models of preferential treatment work when checking preferential treatment work and formulating this year's preferential treatment work plans, which is very important for strengthening our leadership in preferential treatment work.

    注意培养烈属军属模范和优抚工作的模范
    随着优抚工作的加强，各地曾经出现了不少烈属、军属和革命残废军人的模范人物；出现了很多对优抚工作积极努力的模范人物、模范优抚小组、模范代耕组、模范村和模范单位。而培养烈属、军属模范和优抚工作的模范，对于改进优抚工作的领导又有着重要的作用。因为我们的领导机关如果能够经常联系一批烈属、军属、革命残废军人以及优抚工作者中间的代表人物，我们就可以经常听到广大人民群众对于优抚工作的意见，就可以直接地检查和了解优抚政策在下面执行的实际情形。加强领导机关和优抚工作中各种代表人物的联系，这会使烈属、军属和革命残废军人的愿望、要求和困难直接反映到领导机关里来，一方面便于接受他们的批评建议以改正优抚工作中的缺点；另方面又可以使自己的领导工作得到人民群众比较深入的检查，这对于克服优抚工作领导上的官僚主义是很有帮助的。
    培养优抚工作的模范，对于人民群众是一种很好的教育。优抚工作的模范在人民群众中有良好的影响，它会鼓舞人们向做好优抚工作的单位和个人看齐，并督促人们经常检查自己和周围对于优抚工作进行的情形。这就使作好优抚工作形成一种群众的舆论，在这种情况之下，如果谁对优抚工作不积极，就自然会受到群众的监督和批评。优抚工作是一个经常性的群众性的工作，要把尊敬和关怀烈属、军属和革命残废军人形成一种社会风气，这就须要在人民群众中进行充分的思想教育，而培养优抚工作中的模范，表扬和奖励他们的事迹，正是用具体榜样从思想上教育鼓舞人民群众积极参加优抚工作的一个重要的工作。注意培养优抚工作中的模范，同时也可以在政治上教育和提高烈属、军属和革命残废军人本人，因为这样他们将会感到人民政府对于自己的关怀，自己的意见受到了尊重，从而使他们认识到自己的光荣责任和政治荣誉，因而他们就会积极地参加生产，依靠自己的努力改善生活。
    在优抚工作中培养模范的工作，从全国范围来说，有很多地方是已经注意了的。东北区、湖北省以及十三个省（或行署区）的全部县份及七个省的部分县份，都召开过烈属、军属和革命残废军人的模范代表会议，比较有系统地表扬了模范，总结了经验，密切了领导和群众的联系，从而改进了工作。但有些地区的领导机关对这一工作还不够重视，因而那里优抚工作中的模范还没有被发现，他们的经验无人总结，他们的事迹无人表扬，因而优抚工作还不能更多地取得人民群众和烈属、军属、革命残废军人的帮助。
    春节快要到了，中央人民政府内务部于去年十二月十一日即已发出关于春节前后检查与进行优抚工作的指示。各地在检查优抚工作和订立今年优抚工作计划的时候，都应该注意培养优抚工作模范的问题，这对于加强我们优抚工作的领导是很重要的。
