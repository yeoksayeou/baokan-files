    Chongqing's business community has launched an anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement. In recent days, various industries have held accusation and confession meetings, and many bribery facts have been successively exposed. At a conference jointly convened on the 4th by the preparatory committee of the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Chongqing branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, the hardware and grain industries exposed more than 70 cases of bribery. After the anti-corruption movement began, the Southwest Region Company of the China National Grain Corporation established close contact with the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the rice milling and flour industries, jointly mobilizing against corruption and bribery, and jointly conducting confessions and accusations, mutually verifying materials. Currently, more than 30 rice milling and flour enterprises have confessed bribery to the Grain Corporation. After mobilizing all shop employees in the city to participate in the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement, it further promoted the participation of industrial and commercial owners in the movement. Some industries' capitalists originally planned to conceal bribery, but were opposed by shop employees, so they had to confess. In this movement, the Chongqing branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association actively promoted members to confess or accuse, and members of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and many heads of trade associations took the lead in self-reflection and review. For example, the directors of trade associations in the silk and cloth, paint, electrical materials, and automobile repair industries all first confessed their bribery behaviors, and some also revealed bribery situations within the industry, guaranteeing to promote the entire industry's participation in the movement. Zhu Yunfeng, a member of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, took the lead in confessing that he had once bribed 25 million yuan. In addition, agencies that had business dealings with industrial and commercial households sent special personnel to various relevant industries to assist in further promoting the movement.

    重庆市工商界展开反贪污反行贿斗争
    贸易部门和有关行业联合进行坦白检举
    重庆市工商界已投入反贪污反行贿运动。连日来各行业分别召开检举和坦白会议，许多行贿的事实已被陆续揭发出来。在四日由重庆市工商业联合会筹委会和民主建国会重庆市分会共同召开的大会上，五金和粮食两业就揭发了行贿行为七十多件。中国粮食公司西南区公司在反贪污运动开始后就和工商业联合会及碾米、面粉两业取得密切联系，共同动员反对贪污行贿，并联合进行坦白检举，互相对证材料。目前碾米、面粉两业到粮食公司坦白行贿的已有三十多家。全市店员动员起来参加反贪污反行贿运动以后，也进一步促进了工商业主参加运动。有些行业的资方原计划要隐瞒行贿行为，但遭到店员反对，因此只好坦白出来。在这一运动中，民主建国会重庆市分会曾经积极推动会员坦白或检举，市工商业联合会筹委会委员和许多同业公会负责人也带头进行反省和检讨。如绸布、油漆、电料、汽车修配等业同业公会主任委员都首先坦白出自己的行贿行为，有的还说出同业中行贿的情况，保证推动全行业参加运动。市工商业联合会筹委会委员祝允丰带头坦白曾一次行贿二千五百万元。此外，和工商业户有业务来往的机关都派了专人到各有关行业中去，协助推动运动进一步开展。
