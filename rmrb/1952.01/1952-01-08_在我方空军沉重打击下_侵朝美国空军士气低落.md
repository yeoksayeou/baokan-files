Xinhua News Agency, January 5th: A dispatch from Electric Communications Agency, Hong Kong, January 3rd: According to a Busan report: The headquarters of US Far East Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Weyland has received increasing reports indicating that the combat morale of American aircraft pilots and ground crew fighting in Korea is declining.

These reports indicate that the decline in combat morale is due to the dragging on of the Panmunjom ceasefire negotiations, the general state of chaos at the front, and finally the heavy losses of the US Air Force in the Korean air war.

The report states: The setbacks in engagements with the aircraft of the Korean and Chinese side have caused pessimistic sentiments among the US Air Force personnel. Like the ground troops, the aircraft pilots are also unwilling to fight desperately, because they expect a truce agreement will be signed.

    在我方空军沉重打击下
    侵朝美国空军士气低落
    【新华社五日讯】电通社香港三日讯：据釜山消息：美国驻远东空军司令威兰中将的总部收到愈来愈多的报告，表明在朝鲜作战的美国飞机驾驶员和地勤人员的战斗士气越来越低落。
    这些报告表明：战斗士气之所以这样低落，是由于板门店停火谈判的拖延，由于前线的普遍混乱现象，最后是由于美国空军在朝鲜空战中的惨重损失。
    报告说：与朝中方面飞机交战的失利，在美国空军人员中间引起了悲观的情绪。和地面部队一样，飞机驾驶员们也不愿拚命去打仗，因为他们期望停战协定将会签订。
