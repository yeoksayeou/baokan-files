    Embezzler Jin Jiaxiang Refuses to Confess, Sent to People's Court for Legal Action
    To the Editor: Jin Jiaxiang, an accountant in the General Affairs Section of the Central Bureau of Private Enterprises, embezzled 17 million yuan of public funds and adamantly refused to confess. He has been dismissed from his post and sent to the People's Court for punishment.

    Jin Jiaxiang began working in 1949, initially in the Economic Planning Department of the Central Ministry of Trade, and then transferred to the Trademark Registration Office of the Central Bureau of Private Enterprises in August 1950. Last September, due to a job transfer, his superiors asked him to hand over his accounts, but he repeatedly delayed under various pretexts. Later, the bureau discovered his suspicious behavior and inspected his accounts, at which point he admitted to misusing public funds. However, he was extremely cunning and attempted to deny the facts through various means. After the issue was discovered, he purchased 1,500 jin of Xiaozhan rice on credit from the Financial and Economic Commission's employee consumer cooperative, and 1,007.5 jin of indica rice and 50 jin of sesame oil on credit from the Beijing Grain Company's Seventh Store, falsely claiming them as food stocks to reconcile his accounts and prevent the exposure of his crimes.

    On January 10th, the Central Bureau of Private Enterprises held a general meeting, giving him a final opportunity to confess, but he remained stubbornly unrepentant. The masses at the meeting were extremely indignant and launched a fierce struggle against him, unanimously demanding his dismissal and legal prosecution. The chairman of the meeting accepted the demands of the masses and announced his dismissal on the spot, and he was sent to the Beijing People's Court for legal action.
                                                                                                   Zhao Guowei

    贪污分子金家骧拒绝坦白已被送人民法院法办
    编辑同志：中央私营企业局总务科会计金家骧，私自动用公款一千七百万元，坚决拒绝坦白，已被撤职送人民法院惩办。
    金家骧在一九四九年参加工作，先在中央贸易部经济计划司工作，一九五○年八月到中央私营企业局商标注册处工作。去年九月间，因调动工作，上级叫他交代账目，经数次催促，他总是借故拖延。后来局里发觉他的行为可疑，检查他的账目，他才承认自己动用公款。但他的态度极为狡猾，企图用种种方法抵赖。在问题被发觉后，他就向财政经济委员会机关员工消费合作社赊购小站米一千五百斤；向北京市粮食公司第七店赊购油籼米一千零七斤半和香油五十斤，伪作伙食结存，使收支相符，妄图使案情不致暴露。
    一月十日中央私营企业局召开全局群众大会，给他最后坦白机会，但他仍死不坦白。会上群众极为气愤，对他展开了激烈的斗争，并一致要求把他撤职法办。大会主席接受群众的要求，当场宣布撤销他的职务，并送北京人民法院法办。    赵国维
