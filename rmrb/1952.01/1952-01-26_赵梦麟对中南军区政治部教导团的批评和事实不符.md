    Zhao Menglin's Criticism of the Political Department Training Regiment of the Central South Military Region Does Not Accord with the Facts

    Editor Comrades: On December 6, 1951, the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily published a letter from Zhao Menglin criticizing our department for "violating the system and selling supply grain." Our department immediately conducted an investigation. We now report the investigation as follows:

    From August 1951 to the present, we have sold 226,010 jin of rice, of which 142,510 jin were relief grain for our regiment's trainees, and the other 80,000-plus jin were surplus grain. The relief grain had to be converted into money; was it permissible to sell the surplus grain? According to the instructions of higher authorities, it was permissible. Before July 1951, our regiment's surplus grain was sold by higher authorities on our behalf, and the higher authorities gave us cash at the price. In order to simplify procedures, starting in August, the higher authorities instructed us to sell it locally. Our department then began selling in Hengshan. The money from the sale of surplus grain was all given to the mess units to improve the food. This was explicitly stipulated by higher authorities last October. This regulation is unified throughout the army.

    Since our department directly handled the sale of surplus grain, we sold it twice in August and September, both times to the Hengshan County Trading Company. In October, Hengshan County established a Grain Company, and the city's grain was no longer purchased by the Trading Company. When we sold grain for the third time in October, the Trading Company told us to go to the Grain Company, and the Grain Company sent Comrade Wang Jianzhang from our department to the exchange to sell it. All these times, we went through formal procedures with official certifications from the organization, and so did the 140,000-plus jin of relief grain. Therefore, Zhao Menglin's criticism does not accord with the facts.

    赵梦麟对中南军区政治部教导团的批评和事实不符
    编辑同志：一九五一年十二月六日，人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了赵梦麟批评我处“不应该违反制度，变卖供给粮”的来信。我处立刻进行检查。现在把检查情况报告如下：
    我们从一九五一年八月起到现在，出售过二十二万六千零十斤米，其中有十四万二千五百零十斤是我团学员救济粮，其他八万多斤是节余粮。救济粮是必须变成钱的；节余粮准不准出售呢？根据上级机关的指示是准许的。一九五一年七月以前，我团的节余粮都是由上级代卖，上级按价发给我们现金。为了简化手续，从八月起，上级指示我们就地出售。我处才开始在衡山出售。以节余粮变卖的钱，全部交伙食单位做改善伙食用了。这是去年十月上级明文规定的。这个规定是全军统一的。
    自从我处直接经手出售节余粮以后，八、九月份出售过两次，都是卖给衡山县贸易公司的。十月份衡山县成立了粮食公司，城市的粮食就不归贸易公司收购了。十月份我们第三次出售粮食，是由贸易公司告诉我们去找粮食公司，经粮食公司派人带领我处王建章同志到交易所出售的。这几次都是经过机关的正式证明，以正当手续办理的，那十四万多斤救济粮也是如此。因此，赵梦麟的批评是不符合事实的。　　中南军区政治部教导团后勤处
