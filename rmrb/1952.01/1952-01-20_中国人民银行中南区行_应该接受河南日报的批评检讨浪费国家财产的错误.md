    To the Editor: The People's Bank of China, Henan Branch's extravagant spending on entertaining the General Office's inspection team is a serious waste event, and the Central and Southern District Branch of the People's Bank of China should also bear important responsibility. Before the summary meeting began (September 28, 1951), He Youqi, Deputy Director of the Central and Southern District Branch, notified the Henan Branch by telephone that the General Office's inspection team had decided to summarize their work in Kaifeng, and the District Branch would send someone to Kaifeng to make arrangements, with the District Branch responsible for the conference expenses. On October 4, 1951, the Central and Southern District Branch sent Geng Shutian, head of the Public Relations Section, to Kaifeng to carry out preparatory work. After arriving in Kaifeng, Geng Shutian introduced the "grand occasions" of entertaining the General Office's inspection team in Shanghai, Guangzhou and other places, and inspected the equipment of the Henan Branch and the conditions of hotels in Kaifeng. Subsequently, he formulated a huge purchasing plan and compiled a budget of 78.8 million yuan. After the furniture and other items were purchased, 139 people were transferred to form the conference secretariat. Geng Shutian returned to the Central and Southern District Branch only after the secretariat was formed.
    During the conference, Li Shaoyu, Deputy Director of the Central and Southern District Branch, served as the Director of the Conference Executive Office, managing all matters of the conference. In terms of food, the Executive Office stipulated that cadres above the level of Director of the District Branch would receive 20,000 yuan per day; cadres at and below the level of Director of the Branch would receive 10,000 yuan per day (meals were calculated at ten jin of wheat per day, and three days later the Executive Office decided to change it to twelve jin of wheat per day). The director's bodyguards and service personnel were also provided with food according to this standard. In addition, the Central and Southern District Branch specially purchased thirty dozen bottles of Shanxi aged vinegar and thirty dozen bottles of Zhuyeqing wine from Shanxi for gifts.
    In total, this conference squandered 250.13 million yuan of state assets, of which 118.22 million yuan was used for food, accommodation, tea, cigarettes, fruit, and other expenses, all of which were reimbursed by the Central and Southern District Branch. This shows that the serious waste event of the Henan Branch entertaining the General Office's inspection team was caused under the leadership of the Central and Southern District Branch.
    After learning about the above situation, we sent a letter to the Central and Southern District Branch on December 29, 1951, requesting them to investigate this matter. The Central and Southern District Branch ignored our opinion and did not reply. On January 9, 1952, we sent another express letter with relevant materials, urging them to deal with it quickly, but to this day, the Central and Southern District Branch has not yet replied to us. At a time when the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is being carried out vigorously, the leading comrades of the Central and Southern District Branch are still resisting criticism with a bureaucratic attitude. This behavior is truly intolerable. In order to safeguard the interests of the state and the people, we must persist in the struggle against the bureaucratic attitude of the Central and Southern District Branch. We are writing to you for your support and to request you to strictly criticize the Central and Southern District Branch and urge them to promptly conduct a public self-criticism of the wasteful behavior of the Henan Branch in entertaining the General Office's inspection team.
    General Editorial Office of Henan Daily

    Editor's Note: As stated in the letter, the attitude of the Central and Southern District Branch of the People's Bank of China towards criticism is extremely wrong. It is hoped that the relevant leading departments will urge the person in charge of the Central and Southern District Branch of the People's Bank of China to promptly conduct a self-criticism on this matter.

### 中国人民银行中南区行  应该接受河南日报的批评检讨浪费国家财产的错误

    中国人民银行中南区行
    应该接受河南日报的批评检讨浪费国家财产的错误
    编辑同志：中国人民银行河南省分行挥霍巨款招待总行视察团的严重浪费事件，人民银行中南区行同样应负重要责任。在总结会议开始以前（一九五一年九月二十八日），中南区行何幼琦副行长就用电话通知河南分行说：总行视察团决定在开封总结工作，区行将派人到开封布置，大会费用由区行负责。一九五一年十月四日，中南区行派交际股长耿书田到开封进行筹备工作。耿书田到开封后，介绍了上海、广州等地招待总行视察团的“盛况”，并察看河南省分行的设备和开封市旅馆的情况，接着制定了庞大的购买计划，编造了为数达七千八百八十万元的预算。家具什物购买齐全后，就抽调一百三十九人组成大会秘书处。耿书田在秘书处组成后，才返回中南区行。
    大会进行期间，中南区行副行长李绍禹任大会执行处主任，管理大会一切事宜。在伙食方面，执行处规定区行行长以上干部每天两万元；分行行长、处长以下干部每天一万元（包饭按十斤小麦一天计算，三天后执行处又决定改为一天十二斤小麦），行长的警卫员、服务员也一律按这种标准供给伙食。另外，中南区行为了送礼，并特由山西买来陈醋三十打（瓶装），竹叶青酒三十打（瓶装）。
    总计这次会议挥霍了国家资财二亿五千零十三万元，其中用于食宿，茶、烟、水果等方面的费用达一亿一千八百二十二万元，全由中南区行报销。由此可见，河南省分行招待总行视察团的严重浪费事件，是在中南区行领导下造成的。
    当我们了解以上情况后，就在一九五一年十二月二十九日函请中南区行对这一事件进行检查。中南区行对于我们的意见，竟置之不理，不作答复。一九五二年一月九日，我们又用快信一件，转去有关材料，并催其迅速处理，但到现在，中南区行仍未答复我们。正值大张旗鼓地反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的时候，中南区行领导同志仍以官僚主义态度抵制批评，这种行为实在令人不能容忍。为了维护国家人民利益，我们对中南区行的官僚主义态度要坚持斗争。特函请您们给我们以支持，并请您们对中南区行进行严格的批评，督促他们迅速对河南省分行招待总行视察团的浪费行为作公开检讨。

    编者按：如来信所述，人民银行中南区行对待批评的态度是极端错误的。希望有关领导方面，督促人民银行中南区行负责人，对此事迅速作检讨。
