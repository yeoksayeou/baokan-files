    I Begin to Recognize Myself
    Zhang Hanying
    I was born into a landlord family, received a Confucian education in my childhood, and later studied engineering in the United States. Because there was little engineering construction during the reactionary rule, most of my time after graduating from school was spent in engineering institutions engaged in internal work (including technical and administrative), occasionally teaching or holding administrative positions in schools. Because I sometimes held administrative positions, I had direct relationships with the reactionary ruling class. At first, driven by a sense of "career," I was very active and planned to accomplish something. Later, in view of the darkness and corruption of the reactionary government, I gradually became depressed. However, because I did not recognize the path to brightness and had muddled ideas in politics, I always clung to the reactionary government. Since liberation, in the process of participating in work for more than two years, I have received a good education, which has brought about great changes in me, allowing me to see the light, recognize the truth, and be willing to fight for the truth. Therefore, I urgently need to study and intensify my ideological remolding.
    I studied hydraulic engineering and paid particular attention to the management of the Yellow River, with a strong sense of "career" and a desire to manage it well and benefit the people. Therefore, for more than twenty years, I have been studying it "with perseverance." Whether participating in this work or engaging in other work, I always devoted myself to exploring this issue in my spare time. As a result, I have received praise from many people. I now feel that there are still many unclean things hidden inside this coat, because this career-mindedness is mixed with personal interests and personal honor. (As for whether this career would benefit the people or the reactionary ruling class, I had never thought about it before.) Personal interests and personal honor are often expressed in these aspects: my opinions or plans for river management, although also based on the collection of data, were often based on my subjective view of how it should be done, and I would advocate and promote it accordingly. Even when considering practical needs, it was very abstract. For example, I often blindly advocated based on a concept that flood prevention, irrigation of fields, and hydropower generation are always needed. I did not give enough consideration to combining it with the specific needs of a certain area or developing it step by step under certain circumstances. In other words, it was divorced from reality. And this subjective and one-sided view is often dominated by personal interests. Furthermore, I have personal heroism and a simple desire for fame. In other words, although I am dedicated to the management of the Yellow River, I do not regard it as the cause of the people, but only as a personal cause.
    Speaking of personal honor, I think of an example of "keeping oneself clean." In 1931, when building a port in Huludao, I saw workers being subjected to various abuses, with low wages and incomplete payments. After the wages were paid, the foremen would entice them to gamble. At the end of the year, they would buy a boat ticket and send them back to Shandong, with nothing left to their name. I learned that the happiness of capitalists is built on the suffering of workers. I studied engineering, and whenever I was in financial difficulty, I had the idea of becoming a contractor. But when I thought of the tragic situation in Huludao, I made the decision to never do it. But it only stopped at myself not doing it. Could the suffering of the workers be alleviated as a result? Obviously not. It was just that I did not directly exploit the workers by becoming a contractor. It is more accurate to say that I was protecting myself rather than caring for the workers.
    The thought of planning for myself did not only stop at keeping myself clean, but also had worse developments. For example, I initially had no good or bad feelings about the Kuomintang, but later I developed a sense of disgust for it. Therefore, although I worked under the reactionary government for many years, I did not participate. However, in 1944, when the reactionary government wanted to send me to the United States to study water conservancy, I had to participate in the pseudo-Central Training Corps before going abroad. All those who participated in the training corps had to join the Kuomintang, so I also joined the Kuomintang in the form of collective participation. Although I did not participate in any activities later, it was enough to show that for the sake of personal immediate interests, anything could be sacrificed. When the benefits were great, I could not care about being clean or not. This is such a dangerous thing!
    In the past, I often looked at problems in an isolated, one-sided, and apolitical way. For example, in the past, when I analyzed the causes of the Yellow River's disasters, I always emphasized that it contained too much sediment and that the floods rose and fell too violently. When talking about human causes, I only said that the prevention was inadequate. I never realized the social factors of the reactionary ruling class's disregard for the people's lives, not building water conservancy for the people, or even destroying water conservancy for the benefit of a few. Also, when I studied Pan Jixun's strategy for governing the Yellow River in the Ming Dynasty, although I also analyzed the basic situation at that time and found that the main purpose of the Ming Dynasty's governance of the Yellow River was to facilitate water transport, I lightly glossed over it and then analyzed Pan Jixun's methods. However, I did not further study who the water transport was for, and whether the disasters of the Yellow River could be avoided and water resources developed under this purpose. At that time, the Ming capital was Yanjing, and the supply of the ruling group had to rely on the south. And the Yellow River flowing south, seizing the Huai River and entering the sea, so the Yellow River was a major artery to maintain shipping. Four million shi of grain required regular transport north. Not only was the grain exploited, but also the corvée system was used to harass the people during the transport of grain. Based on this purpose, there could not be a correct policy for governing the river. But I did not consider this point, and simply studied the technology of river management, which inevitably led to extremely serious errors.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, I recognized the people's organization and strength, but I did not know the root of this organization and strength. I thought that China would be good after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. But after the victory, this illusion quickly disappeared. As a result, I fell into an abyss of depression and pessimism. At that time, I also approached young students, and their progress and enthusiasm greatly moved and educated me, and my spirit was entrusted. But I did not know the root of their progress and enthusiasm, and even thought that this was the relationship of "youth," and that youth was always enthusiastic and progressive. But would they degenerate when they came to society? As a result, I thought of some progressive young people in the May Fourth Movement, and many of them degenerated later. So I hesitated again. This shows how muddled my understanding of political issues was.
    I often used the banner of not asking about politics, and subjectively believed that I really did not ask about politics, so I felt that I was "noble," which is very wrong. In fact, I often participated in political activities and followed the reactionary ruling class. On the one hand, I hated its darkness and corruption, and on the other hand, I still had illusions about it. And I was educated by American imperialism, so I admired its "way of life" very much. Although I saw many shortcomings on the surface, I always thought it was stronger than China and was the road that China should take. I thought I did not ask about politics, but in fact, I was ideologically and action-wise led by imperialism and the reactionary ruling class. Here are a few more specific facts to illustrate.
    In early 1948, I went to work at Beiyang University, thinking that I had thrown away "fame and fortune" relatively cleanly, so as soon as I arrived at the school, I announced "everything for the school." - In fact, the component of personal heroism was very strong, let alone that. At that time, Beiyang University had not been in charge for two years. After I arrived, the school's work did improve somewhat, the students had better reading opportunities, and the school's various tasks gradually got on track. Does this represent the whole picture of the facts? No. Although I was running the school in good faith, and although I subjectively did everything for the school, what I represented was the reactionary ruling class, and was opposed to the interests of the masses. Since it was opposed, although the school was on track and beneficial to the students, it also helped the rule of the reactionary government.
    This shows that I had no concept of the enemy and ourselves in the past, let alone distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. This backward and muddled thinking made me very qualified to be a vase and accomplice of the reactionary ruling class. In fact, the reactionary ruling class also recognized this vase and accomplice. There were many jobs that I did not seek, but I was "favored" by the reactionary government. I always thought this was "noble," and that the work I got was what I deserved. Others often "complimented" me in this way. Now it seems that this kind of thinking and behavior is despicable and shameful. For example, in 1941, I was sent to preside over the Yellow River work, which was a position that many people sought but could not get, and suddenly fell on my head. I was naturally very happy to accept it, because I had "interest" and "career-mindedness" in the Yellow River. Also, in the winter of 1946, I was about to end my inspection of the upper reaches of the Yellow River. On the morning of boarding the train in Gui Sui, I saw in the newspaper that I had been elected as a pseudo-National Congress representative with the title of "social worthy." Although this was an unexpected thing and I was not interested, this highly political position did not arouse my vigilance, let alone realize that this was the result of my own conditions for being an accomplice. In the winter of 1947, the reactionary government invited me to work at Beiyang University. I did not agree at first and did not consider this issue. After more than two months, I still agreed because of the students' demands. Because of the above many facts, friends often said that I had no "backing" and was the result of "ten years of hard study." Others said that I was "selling scabies medicine behind closed doors" - naturally someone would come to me. In fact, I had a backing, and the backing was the reactionary government. And I was not noble, but "waiting for a price." All this shows that I was very qualified to be a tool of the reactionary ruling class, and in fact I have already been their tool. In other words, I stood in the ranks of the reactionary ruling class and did things that were beneficial to the reactionary rulers. How can I still claim to be noble, aloof, apolitical, and devoted to technology?
    Thanks to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, I saw the light, recognized the truth, and began to recognize myself. I am determined to transform myself, to transform myself thoroughly, so that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, I can serve the people wholeheartedly.

    我开始认识自己
    张含英
    我出身于地主家庭，幼年受的是孔孟教育，后来又在美国学习工程。由于在反动统治时期很少兴办工程，所以从学校毕业以后，大部的时间是在工程机关里担任内业工作（包括技术的和行政的），间或在学校里担任教书或行政职务。因为有时担任行政工作，也就和反动统治阶级发生了直接的关系。其初由于“事业心”的驱使，很积极，打算有些作为。后来鉴于反动政府的黑暗、腐败，渐趋消沉。但是由于不认识光明的道路，在政治上有着糊涂思想，所以始终依附于反动政府。解放以来，在参加工作二年多的过程中，我受到了很好的教育，因之有了很大的变化，使我看到了光明，认识了真理，并且愿为真理而斗争。所以我迫切地需要学习，加紧进行思想改造。
    我是学习水利工程的，尤其注意于黄河的治理，很有“事业心”，想把它治好，造福人群。所以在二十几年中，“锲而不舍”地研究，不管参加这项工作，或担任别种工作，在业余的时间，总是专心致志于这一问题的探讨。因之得到许多人的称赞。我现在觉得这个外衣里面还隐藏着很多不洁净的东西，因为在这一事业心里还夹杂着个人兴趣和个人荣誉。（至于这一事业将有利于人民，还是有利于反动统治阶级，以前就更没想到。）关于个人兴趣和个人荣誉常表现在这几方面：我的治河意见或计划，虽也经过资料的搜集，却常常由于我主观地看着应该怎样做，我就怎样提倡，怎样鼓吹。就是考虑到实际需要，也是很抽象的。例如常根据一种概念，认为防御水灾、灌溉田亩、水力发电等总是需要的，就盲目地提倡。对于结合某一地区的具体需要，或在某种情况下要有步骤地开发，则考虑得不够。换言之，是脱离实际的。而这种主观的、片面的见解，就常为个人兴趣所左右。再就是我有个人英雄主义和单纯好名观念。换言之，虽然是致力于黄河的治理，但是没有把它当作人民的事业，只是看作个人的事业。
    说到个人荣誉，想到一个关于“洁身自好”的例子。一九三一年在葫芦岛筑港的时候，看到工人受着种种虐待，工资低而且不全发。发放工资以后，工头又引诱他们赌博。到了年底买一张船票送回山东，身外无长物。我了解到资本家的幸福是建筑在工人的痛苦上的。我是学工程的，每在生活困难的时候，就动了做包工的念头。但是一想到葫芦岛的惨象，就下了决心，绝对不干。但也仅仅停止到自己不干，工人的痛苦能不能因此解除呢？显然不能解除，只是自己没有用包工的方法直接剥削工人。与其说是爱护工人，还不如说爱惜自己较为恰当。
    为个人打算的思想，不只停在洁身自好，还会有更坏的发展。例如我对于国民党，最初没有好坏的感觉，后来就对它生了厌恶之感。所以虽在反动政府下工作多年，都没有参加。可是在一九四四年，反动政府要派我到美国去考察水利时，由于出国前必须参加伪中央训练团，凡参加训练团的就必须入国民党，因之我也在集体参加的形式下参加了国民党。虽然后来并没有参加什么活动，但也足以说明为了个人目前的利益，什么都可以牺牲，在利重的时候，也就顾不得洁不洁了。这是多么危险的事！
    在过去看问题常是孤立的、片面的、脱离政治的。例如我过去分析黄河为患的原因，总强调它含的泥沙过多，洪水的涨落过猛。谈到人为的原因也只说防范不周，从来就没有体会到反动统治阶级的不顾到人民的生活，不为人民兴修水利，甚或为了少数人的利益而破坏水利的社会因素。又我在研究明朝潘季驯的治河方略时，我虽也曾分析那时的基本情况，并且找出明朝治理黄河的主要目的在于便利漕运。但轻轻地一笔交代过去，接着就分析潘季驯的方法，却没有进一步研究漕运是为了谁，以及在这一目的下能否免除黄河的灾害，开发水利的资源。那时明都燕京，统治集团的供应必须仰给南方。而黄河南流，夺淮入海，所以黄河便是维持航运的一段主要干线。四百万石粮食就需要有定期的北运。不只粮食是剥削来的，而在运粮之时，还以徭役制度大肆骚扰。根据这一目的就不可能有正确的治河方针。但是我却没考虑到这一点，而单纯地就治河的技术来研究，这就不能不发生极严重的错误。
    在抗日战争时期，我认识了人民的组织和力量，但是却不知道这种组织和力量的根源，以为抗日战争胜利以后中国就会好的。但是在胜利以后这种幻想就很快地消失了。因之使我坠入在消沉、悲观的深渊里。那时我又和青年学生接近，他们的进步和热情使我受到很大的感动，并且教育了我，因之我的精神又有了寄托。但是却不知道他们进步和热情的根源，甚至认为这是“青年”的关系，青年总是热情的、进步的，而将来到社会上会不会堕落呢？因之又回想到五四运动时代的一些进步青年，后来很多人堕落了。于是我又彷徨起来。由此可见我对于政治问题的认识是何等的糊涂。
    我常打着不问政治的招牌，而主观上也认为确实是不问政治的，因而也就觉得自己“清高”，这是十分错误的。事实上我常常参加政治活动，并且跟着反动统治阶级走。我一方面痛恨它的黑暗、腐败，一方面还对它存着幻想。而我又受过美国帝国主义的教育，所以对于它的“生活方式”很崇拜。虽然从表面上也看出它有许多缺点，但总认为比中国强，是中国应走的道路。我自以为不问政治，而事实上在思想上和行动上是受着帝国主义和反动统治阶级的领导的。以下再举几个具体的事实来说明。
    一九四八年初，我到北洋大学工作，自以为把“功名利禄”抛得比较干净，所以一到学校，就宣布“一切为了学校”。——其实个人英雄主义的成分十分浓厚，这且不谈。那时，北洋大学已经两年没人主持，我到了以后，学校工作确实有些改进，同学们得到较好的读书机会，学校的各项工作也逐渐上了轨道。这是不是能代表事实的全面呢？不能的。我虽然是善意地办学校，我虽然主观地一切为了学校，但是我所代表的是反动统治阶级，和群众的利益是对立的。既然对立，虽然学校上了轨道，对同学有益处，但也有助于反动政府的统治。
    由此可见我过去没有敌我观念，更分不清敌我。这种落后的、糊涂的思想就使我很有条件做反动统治阶级的花瓶和帮凶，事实上反动统治阶级也认识了这个花瓶和帮凶。有许多工作自己并没奔走谋求，而受到反动政府的“青睐”。我一直认为这是“清高”，而得到的工作是分所应当。别人也常这样“恭维”我。现在看来这种思想和行为是卑鄙可耻的。例如一九四一年，我被派去主持黄河工作，这是一个很多人谋求不得的位置，忽然落在我的头上，我自然也很乐意接受，因为我对黄河有“兴趣”，有“事业心”。又在一九四六年冬季，我正要结束黄河上游考察，在归绥上车的早晨，看到报上我以“社会贤达”的头衔被选为伪国大代表。虽然这是一件出人意外的事情，我也不感兴趣，但是对于这个政治性的很高的位置并没有引起我的警惕，更没有觉悟到这正是自己备有帮凶条件的结果。一九四七年冬天，反动政府邀我去北洋大学工作，我起初没答应，并且毫不考虑这一问题。经过两个多月的时间，还是鉴于同学们的渴求才答应了的。由于以上的许多事实，朋友们常说我没有“靠山”，是“十年寒窗”的结果。也有的说我是“关着门子卖疥药”——自然有人来找。事实上何尝没有靠山，靠山就是反动政府。又何尝是清高，是“待价而沽”。这一切都说明我很有条件做反动统治阶级的工具，事实上也已经作了它们的工具。质言之，自己就站在反动统治阶级的行列里，就作着有利于反动统治者的事情。这怎样还能以自己清高、超然、不问政治、致力技术自居呢？
    感谢毛主席和共产党，叫我望见了光明，认识了真理，也开始认识了自己。我下决心改造，要彻底改造，好在毛主席和共产党的领导下，全心全意地为人民服务。
