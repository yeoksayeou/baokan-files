    I Begin to Recognize Myself
    Zhang Hanying
    I was born into a landlord family, received a Confucian education in my childhood, and later studied engineering in the United States. Because there was little engineering construction during the reactionary rule, most of my time after graduating from school was spent in engineering institutions engaged in internal work (including technical and administrative), occasionally teaching or holding administrative positions in schools. Because I sometimes held administrative positions, I had direct relationships with the reactionary ruling class. At first, driven by a sense of "career," I was very active and planned to accomplish something. Later, in view of the darkness and corruption of the reactionary government, I gradually became depressed. However, because I did not recognize the path to brightness and had muddled ideas in politics, I always clung to the reactionary government. Since liberation, in the process of participating in work for more than two years, I have received a good education, which has brought about great changes in me, allowing me to see the light, recognize the truth, and be willing to fight for the truth. Therefore, I urgently need to study and intensify my ideological remolding.
    I studied hydraulic engineering and paid particular attention to the management of the Yellow River, with a strong sense of "career" and a desire to manage it well and benefit the people. Therefore, for more than twenty years, I have been studying it "with perseverance." Whether participating in this work or engaging in other work, I always devoted myself to exploring this issue in my spare time. As a result, I have received praise from many people. I now feel that there are still many unclean things hidden inside this coat, because this career-mindedness is mixed with personal interests and personal honor. (As for whether this career would benefit the people or the reactionary ruling class, I had never thought about it before.) Personal interests and personal honor are often expressed in these aspects: my opinions or plans for river management, although also based on the collection of data, were often based on my subjective view of how it should be done, and I would advocate and promote it accordingly. Even when considering practical needs, it was very abstract. For example, I often blindly advocated based on a concept that flood prevention, irrigation of fields, and hydropower generation are always needed. I did not give enough consideration to combining it with the specific needs of a certain area or developing it step by step under certain circumstances. In other words, it was divorced from reality. And this subjective and one-sided view is often dominated by personal interests. Furthermore, I have personal heroism and a simple desire for fame. In other words, although I am dedicated to the management of the Yellow River, I do not regard it as the cause of the people, but only as a personal cause.
    Speaking of personal honor, I think of an example of "keeping oneself clean." In 1931, when building a port in Huludao, I saw workers being subjected to various abuses, with low wages and incomplete payments. After the wages were paid, the foremen would entice them to gamble. At the end of the year, they would buy a boat ticket and send them back to Shandong, with nothing left to their name. I learned that the happiness of capitalists is built on the suffering of workers. I studied engineering, and whenever I was in financial difficulty, I had the idea of becoming a contractor. But when I thought of the tragic situation in Huludao, I made the decision to never do it. But it only stopped at myself not doing it. Could the suffering of the workers be alleviated as a result? Obviously not. It was just that I did not directly exploit the workers by becoming a contractor. It is more accurate to say that I was protecting myself rather than caring for the workers.
    The thought of planning for myself did not only stop at keeping myself clean, but also had worse developments. For example, I initially had no good or bad feelings about the Kuomintang, but later I developed a sense of disgust for it. Therefore, although I worked under the reactionary government for many years, I did not participate. However, in 1944, when the reactionary government wanted to send me to the United States to study water conservancy, I had to participate in the pseudo-Central Training Corps before going abroad. All those who participated in the training corps had to join the Kuomintang, so I also joined the Kuomintang in the form of collective participation. Although I did not participate in any activities later, it was enough to show that for the sake of personal immediate interests, anything could be sacrificed. When the benefits were great, I could not care about being clean or not. This is such a dangerous thing!
    In the past, I often looked at problems in an isolated, one-sided, and apolitical way. For example, in the past, when I analyzed the causes of the Yellow River's disasters, I always emphasized that it contained too much sediment and that the floods rose and fell too violently. When talking about human causes, I only said that the prevention was inadequate. I never realized the social factors of the reactionary ruling class's disregard for the people's lives, not building water conservancy for the people, or even destroying water conservancy for the benefit of a few. Also, when I studied Pan Jixun's strategy for governing the Yellow River in the Ming Dynasty, although I also analyzed the basic situation at that time and found that the main purpose of the Ming Dynasty's governance of the Yellow River was to facilitate water transport, I lightly glossed over it and then analyzed Pan Jixun's methods. However, I did not further study who the water transport was for, and whether the disasters of the Yellow River could be avoided and water resources developed under this purpose. At that time, the Ming capital was Yanjing, and the supply of the ruling group had to rely on the south. And the Yellow River flowing south, seizing the Huai River and entering the sea, so the Yellow River was a major artery to maintain shipping. Four million shi of grain required regular transport north. Not only was the grain exploited, but also the corv√©e system was used to harass the people during the transport of grain. Based on this purpose, there could not be a correct policy for governing the river. But I did not consider this point, and simply studied the technology of river management, which inevitably led to extremely serious errors.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, I recognized the people's organization and strength, but I did not know the root of this organization and strength. I thought that China would be good after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. But after the victory, this illusion quickly disappeared. As a result, I fell into an abyss of depression and pessimism. At that time, I also approached young students, and their progress and enthusiasm greatly moved and educated me, and my spirit was entrusted. But I did not know the root of their progress and enthusiasm, and even thought that this was the relationship of "youth," and that youth was always enthusiastic and progressive. But would they degenerate when they came to society? As a result, I thought of some progressive young people in the May Fourth Movement, and many of them degenerated later. So I hesitated again. This shows how muddled my understanding of political issues was.
    I often used the banner of not asking about politics, and subjectively believed that I really did not ask about politics, so I felt that I was "noble," which is very wrong. In fact, I often participated in political activities and followed the reactionary ruling class. On the one hand, I hated its darkness and corruption, and on the other hand, I still had illusions about it. And I was educated by American imperialism, so I admired its "way of life" very much. Although I saw many shortcomings on the surface, I always thought it was stronger than China and was the road that China should take. I thought I did not ask about politics, but in fact, I was ideologically and action-wise led by imperialism and the reactionary ruling class. Here are a few more specific facts to illustrate.
    In early 1948, I went to work at Beiyang University, thinking that I had thrown away "fame and fortune" relatively cleanly, so as soon as I arrived at the school, I announced "everything for the school." - In fact, the component of personal heroism was very strong, let alone that. At that time, Beiyang University had not been in charge for two years. After I arrived, the school's work did improve somewhat, the students had better reading opportunities, and the school's various tasks gradually got on track. Does this represent the whole picture of the facts? No. Although I was running the school in good faith, and although I subjectively did everything for the school, what I represented was the reactionary ruling class, and was opposed to the interests of the masses. Since it was opposed, although the school was on track and beneficial to the students, it also helped the rule of the reactionary government.
    This shows that I had no concept of the enemy and ourselves in the past, let alone distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. This backward and muddled thinking made me very qualified to be a vase and accomplice of the reactionary ruling class. In fact, the reactionary ruling class also recognized this vase and accomplice. There were many jobs that I did not seek, but I was "favored" by the reactionary government. I always thought this was "noble," and that the work I got was what I deserved. Others often "complimented" me in this way. Now it seems that this kind of thinking and behavior is despicable and shameful. For example, in 1941, I was sent to preside over the Yellow River work, which was a position that many people sought but could not get, and suddenly fell on my head. I was naturally very happy to accept it, because I had "interest" and "career-mindedness" in the Yellow River. Also, in the winter of 1946, I was about to end my inspection of the upper reaches of the Yellow River. On the morning of boarding the train in Gui Sui, I saw in the newspaper that I had been elected as a pseudo-National Congress representative with the title of "social worthy." Although this was an unexpected thing and I was not interested, this highly political position did not arouse my vigilance, let alone realize that this was the result of my own conditions for being an accomplice. In the winter of 1947, the reactionary government invited me to work at Beiyang University. I did not agree at first and did not consider this issue. After more than two months, I still agreed because of the students' demands. Because of the above many facts, friends often said that I had no "backing" and was the result of "ten years of hard study." Others said that I was "selling scabies medicine behind closed doors" - naturally someone would come to me. In fact, I had a backing, and the backing was the reactionary government. And I was not noble, but "waiting for a price." All this shows that I was very qualified to be a tool of the reactionary ruling class, and in fact I have already been their tool. In other words, I stood in the ranks of the reactionary ruling class and did things that were beneficial to the reactionary rulers. How can I still claim to be noble, aloof, apolitical, and devoted to technology?
    Thanks to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, I saw the light, recognized the truth, and began to recognize myself. I am determined to transform myself, to transform myself thoroughly, so that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, I can serve the people wholeheartedly.
