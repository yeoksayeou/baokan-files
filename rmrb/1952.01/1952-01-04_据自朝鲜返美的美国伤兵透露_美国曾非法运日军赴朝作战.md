TASS, Prague, December 30th: According to a dispatch from the Old Gold Mountain (San Francisco) correspondent of the Telegraph News Agency, American wounded soldiers returning from Korea said that in the first two weeks of December, several teams of Japanese soldiers and sergeants, numbering between 100 and 150 people, began arriving in Korea. These soldiers and sergeants belonged to the US 9th Corps and 7th Division. According to the American wounded soldiers, all these Japanese soldiers had received special training in US Army barracks in Gunma, Yamanashi, and Shizuoka prefectures in Japan.

One American wounded soldier spoke of the case of a Japanese sergeant Okada belonging to the 9th Corps. Okada was recruited in Mihara, Hokkaido, in March 1951 by an organization called the "Youth Increased Production Corps" to participate in the Korean War. Okada told the American wounded soldier that this organization was formed under American leadership shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. Since then, the organization has recruited several thousand Japanese soldiers; these soldiers were either sent to Korea or served as auxiliary personnel to the US 10th and 16th Corps.

Okada also revealed that along with him, there were 400 soldiers who had previously fought in China, Malaya, and Burma, as well as several rows of so-called "volunteer soldiers" from the "Rural Youth League" who were trained together.

The wounded soldiers said: All Japanese troops arriving in Korea wear American uniforms. These troops serve as "mopping-up forces" or "police forces" to fight guerrillas and guard roads, supplies, and buildings near the front lines.

    据自朝鲜返美的美国伤兵透露
    美国曾非法运日军赴朝作战
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社布拉格十二月三十日讯：据电通社记者自旧金山报道，从朝鲜回国的美国伤兵说，在十二月的头两个星期中，若干队人数在一百人到一百五十人之间的日本士兵和军士开始抵达朝鲜。这些士兵和军士隶属于美军第九兵团和第七师。据美国伤兵说，所有这些日本士兵都曾在日本群马、山梨和静冈等县的美国陆军兵营中受过特别训练。
    一个美国伤兵谈到一个属于第九兵团的日本军士冈田的情形。冈田是在一九五一年三月在北海道美幌地方被一个名叫“青年增产队”的组织招募去参加朝鲜战争的。冈田对美国伤兵说，这个组织是在一九五○年朝鲜战争爆发后不久在美国领导下组成的。从那时起，这个组织就招募了好几千名日本士兵；这些士兵不是被派到朝鲜去，就是充当美国第十、第十六两兵团的辅助人员。
    冈田还透露，和他一道受训的有以前在中国、马来亚和缅甸作过战的四百名士兵以及所谓“农村青年联盟”的好几排“志愿军”。
    伤兵说：抵达朝鲜的所有日本军队都穿美国制服。这些军队充当“清剿部队”或“警察部队”，来和游击队作战，并守卫前线附近的道路、供应品和建筑物。
