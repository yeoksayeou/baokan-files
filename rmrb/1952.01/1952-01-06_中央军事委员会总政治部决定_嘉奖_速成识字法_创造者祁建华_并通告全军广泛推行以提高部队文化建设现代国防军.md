Xinhua News Agency, 5th: The General Political Department of the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission approved the decision of the Political Department of the Southwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army in December 1951 to commend Qi Jianhua, a cultural instructor of a certain army, for creating the "Rapid Literacy Method."

The "Rapid Literacy Method," which Qi Jianhua has diligently created since 1949, inherits the fine tradition of the People's Liberation Army, which has always attached importance to cultural education and the mass line of integrating cultural education with practice. It makes a significant contribution to the People's Liberation Army's acceleration of the elimination of illiteracy and the improvement of culture. This "Rapid Literacy Method" has been piloted in tens of thousands of people throughout the army and has achieved good results, warmly welcomed by the vast number of commanders and combatants. For this reason, the Political Department of the Southwest Military Region decided to award Qi Jianhua a special merit and the honorary title of "Model Cultural Instructor."

In addition to approving the decision of the Political Department of the Southwest Military Region, the General Political Department also announced the widespread implementation of the "Rapid Literacy Method" created by Qi Jianhua throughout the army to accelerate the elimination of illiteracy, improve culture, and strive to build a modern national defense force.

Qi Jianhua, the creator of the "Rapid Literacy Method," is from Jiaxian County, Henan Province, and comes from a poor peasant background. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1949 and served as a cultural instructor in a certain army of the People's Liberation Army. He began to study this literacy education method during the march and operations to liberate the Great Southwest. In 1950, the "Rapid Literacy Method" he had explored was successfully tested in several units. In 1951, the Southwest Military Region successively opened 87 experimental classes, effectively experimenting with 12,657 cadres and soldiers of worker and peasant origin and 3,030 cultural instructors. In October, the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department, together with the Political Department of the North China Military Region, conducted experiments in several companies. In November, the Second宣教Cultural Work Conference of the People's Liberation Army discussed this literacy method, and the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government also specially convened a symposium of language experts to conduct research. Everyone unanimously believes that the "Rapid Literacy Method" created by Qi Jianhua inherits the fine tradition of cultural education of the People's Liberation Army for many years and is a good method for eliminating illiteracy created in teaching practice.

    中央军事委员会总政治部决定
    嘉奖“速成识字法”创造者祁建华
    并通告全军广泛推行以提高部队文化建设现代国防军
    【新华社五日讯】中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部在一九五一年十二月批准了人民解放军西南军区政治部关于嘉奖某军文化教员“速成识字法”的创造者祁建华的决定。
    祁建华从一九四九年以来所努力创造的“速成识字法”，是继承了人民解放军多年来重视文化教育和文化教育联系实际的群众路线的优良传统，对于人民解放军加速消除文盲，提高文化，有着巨大的贡献。这一“速成识字法”已在全军数万人中试行，收得良好的效果，受到了广大指挥员战斗员的热烈欢迎。为此，西南军区政治部决定给祁建华记特功一次，并赠予“模范文化教员”的光荣称号。
    总政治部除批准西南军区政治部的决定外，并通告全军广泛推行祁建华所创造的“速成识字法”，以加速消除文盲，提高文化，为建设现代化的国防军而奋斗。
    “速成识字法”的创造者祁建华，是河南郏县人，贫农出身，一九四九年加入中国共产党，在人民解放军某军当文化教员。解放大西南行军作战途中，他就开始研究这一识字教育的方法。一九五零年，他所摸索的“速成识字法”在几个单位中试验成功。一九五一年间，西南军区先后开办了八十七个实验班，在一万二千六百五十七个工人和农民出身的干部、战士及三千零三十个文化教员中实验有效。十月，总政治部宣传部又会同华北军区政治部，在若干连队里作了实验。十一月人民解放军全军第二届宣教文化工作会议讨论了这一识字法，中央人民政府教育部并专门召集语文专家座谈会进行研究。大家一致认为祁建华所创造的“速成识字法”，是继承了人民解放军多年文化教育的优良传统，在教学实践中创造出来的消除文盲的良好方法。
