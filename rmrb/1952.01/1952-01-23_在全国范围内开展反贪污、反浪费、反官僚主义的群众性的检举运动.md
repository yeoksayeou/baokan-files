The leading cadres of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Company have not yet mobilized the masses to launch a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism.
Editor: The leading cadres of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Company do not value the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the construction department, and have not yet mobilized the masses. There are serious corruption and waste phenomena within this company. Before the company's reorganization, it recruited more than 400 technical personnel in Shanghai without any plan. After these technical personnel arrived in Beijing, they had nothing to do and were idle for four months. The company's leading cadres felt that these people were too idle, so they asked them to start construction hastily based on a construction sketch. As a result, the entire project was reworked. When the heads of various construction sites came to the company for meetings, they ate and drank lavishly, once a week, which has become a system. Deputy Manager Liu of the company borrowed 30 million yuan to send his wife to Taiyuan and reimbursed it with false accounts. Liu also sent someone to transport a car from Beijing to Taiyuan, spending more than one million yuan on transportation alone. Chen Minying, a procurement officer at the 5119 construction site in the western suburbs, embezzled more than 30 million yuan. Zhang Wenhui, the section chief of the company's estimation section, sent the case to Director Yang of the office for handling. Director Yang, because he himself was not clean and had a good relationship with Chen Minying, did not care about this matter at all. A cadre at the 5119 construction site used the public truck to steal materials, which was discovered by the truck workers midway and brought back to the construction site. The leading cadres of the construction site did not question the thieves who stole people's property, but instead dismissed the workers a few days later on the pretext that the truck workers were not "active" in their work.

Although the company's corruption and waste situation is very serious, the leading cadres do not care. Recently, a person in charge said, "Last year we did more than 200 billion yuan of business, and wasting 10 billion yuan is nothing!" Therefore, they do not value the great political struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism. I hope the relevant authorities will deal with it quickly.

The responsible cadres of the Zhonghua Brick Factory should examine their bureaucratic work style.
Editor: The responsible cadres of the state-owned Zhonghua Brick Factory in Beijing have a bureaucratic work style. For example, when repairing the three horseshoe kilns, Manager Guo ignored the workers' opinions and insisted on adopting the Shanxi repair method. This project cost 12 million yuan. After the repair, 150,000 bricks were fired in four kilns, and 130,000 to 140,000 bricks were unusable. When repairing the large chimney, Director Sun did not personally go down to supervise, did not rely on the workers, but relied on the foreman Zhao Zideng. As a result, the chimney collapsed when it was more than ten meters high. This time, the loss of labor and materials was more than 300 million yuan, and two kiln doors were also smashed. On December 5th last year, without consideration, they laid off sixteen workers and gave them more than 2 million yuan for travel expenses. But soon, they wanted these workers to come back, wasting travel expenses in vain. Since the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began in the factory, the trade union wanted Director Sun to serve as the director of the savings inspection committee. Sun said, "Anti-bureaucracy is also against me, and anti-waste is also against me. I will not participate." After everyone's repeated explanations, Sun finally agreed. At the workers' congress, Director Sun only criticized the workers' shortcomings and did not mention his own shortcomings at all, which aroused great dissatisfaction among the workers. We suggest that Director Sun and Manager Guo make a profound self-criticism of the waste caused by bureaucracy, so as to improve the people's enterprise in the future.

Leading cadres of the Hunan Branch of the South Central Nonferrous Metals Administration should examine extravagance and waste.
Editor: The Hunan Branch of the South Central Military and Political Committee's Industrial Department of Nonferrous Metals Administration has serious waste. They spent nearly 10 billion yuan to build two four-story reinforced concrete office buildings. During construction, many newly purchased and quite good private houses and the director's residence, which had been completed not long ago, were demolished. The waste was huge. In order to satisfy the interest of a few people in the bureau in Peking Opera, they once recruited a group of Peking Opera amateurs in Changsha to serve as employees. They had to sing for two or three days every festival, spending a lot of money. Some people even slept in the dormitory the next morning because they sang too late, but the leading cadres turned a blind eye. After liberation, the bureau acquired dozens of urban houses, forcing many employees living in rented houses in the southern district to move, which temporarily caused a housing shortage and rising house prices in Changsha. The Changsha Municipal People's Representative Conference passed a resolution that public institutions should no longer purchase private houses. However, the bureau ignored the regulations and bought another private house. Knowing that this was illegal, they instigated the homeowner to use methods such as inviting tenants to eat and drink to get the tenants to move. The leading cadres of this bureau should make a profound self-criticism of these extravagant wastes and behaviors that do not comply with government laws and regulations.

The state-owned trade system in various places has serious waste in warehousing work.
Editor: The warehousing work of the state-owned trade system, due to some comrades' failure to study storage methods and material properties, failure to conduct in-depth inspections of material management, sloppy work, negligence, perfunctoriness, and waste of a large amount of state property.

Some comrades who do warehousing work, because they do not study their business well, cannot distinguish between main materials and secondary materials, so they cannot use warehouses rationally, resulting in waste. For example, the Handan City Department Store in Hebei Province built ten new warehouses according to needs last year, but the custodians emphasized the urgent need for offices and dormitories, and converted one warehouse into a dormitory and office, and two to store secondary materials, but piled the main materials in a few warehouses. As a result, the cement floor of the warehouse cracked and sank due to excessive load (exceeding the safe storage height by 30% to 50%), and some of the stored white sugar melted due to heat and some caked due to pressure. Some comrades do not investigate and study the situation, but only rely on experience. For example, the warehouse staff of the Nanjing Grain Company, based on past experience in storing rice, piled wheat into ventilated stacks, causing 30 million catties of wheat to become infested with insects. Another example is the cadres of the Handan City Grain Company in Hebei Province, who turned and dried 480,000 catties of sorghum with a moisture content of 13.4% (below the safe moisture content), wasting 3,000 catties of wages and grain. Some comrades simply emphasize thrift and do not focus on the big picture. For example, a warehouse in Guangzhou found that 376 bags of rice were already hot and about to deteriorate, but the person in charge of storage was afraid of spending money and refused to change the stack and spread it out. The wheat of the Nanjing Grain Company was infested with insects, and the processors said: "Insects are born every year. If we spray powder and turn the pile, I am afraid the cost will be greater than what the insects eat." As a result, the loss was greater than the gain, causing huge losses. There are also many examples of warehouse fires and thefts caused by the negligence of the staff. For example, the storage and transportation comrades of the North China Import and Export Company did not have enough understanding of the performance of the goods, and did not study the work, and put toxic and flammable goods and ordinary materials together. As a result, a fire broke out due to carelessness during handling. In addition to the poisoning of 546 people, materials worth more than 800 million yuan were burned down; the cadres of the Shashi Yarn Factory in Lijiatuo, Chongqing, were negligent, and the cotton warehouse was set on fire by special agents, causing a loss of 973.3 million yuan.

The above situation shows that there is serious waste in the warehousing work of the state-owned trade system. The relevant departments should combine the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement to conduct in-depth inspections and put forward improvement opinions.

Meng Zhaoyue exposed her lover's corruption and confessed her own wrongdoings.
Editor: Meng Zhaoyue, a student of the Beijing Public Security School, exposed the corrupt behavior of her lover Chen Xiang and confessed that she had sympathized with and sheltered people who smoked opium. The spirit of Comrade Meng Zhaoyue is worth learning from.

Chen Xiang was a car driver of the Beijing Public Security Bureau. Last autumn, he escorted prisoners to Jehol. On the way back to Beijing, he took passengers for a fee (the amount is unknown). He and the driver's assistant Guan Wenyuan embezzled a total of 440,000 yuan (Chen Xiang received 240,000 yuan and Guan Wenyuan received 200,000 yuan). Chen Xiang took the money home and told his lover Meng Zhaoyue. Meng Zhaoyue said, "If you don't return the money to the public, what will happen if the superiors find out?" Chen Xiang not only didn't think it was wrong, but thought he was clever and thought the superiors wouldn't know if he didn't say it. Meng Zhaoyue didn't pay attention to this matter anymore. In March 1951, when the Beijing Public Security Bureau banned Yiguandao, Chen Xiang took the opium ash (one or two taels) of Yiguandao disciples confiscated by the Public Security Bureau home. Meng Zhaoyue not only did not criticize this illegal behavior, but gave the ash to her uncle and accepted 50,000 yuan from her uncle. In this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, Meng Zhaoyue realized that her past behavior was shameful and illegal. Although her lover Chen Xiang has volunteered to participate in the transportation work to North Korea, she still reported her husband's past corruption to the Beijing Public Security Bureau and confessed her own wrongdoings to the organization of the Beijing Public Security School. She also wrote to her lover, asking him to confess his mistakes and report other corrupt elements.

After Meng Zhaoyue entered the Beijing Public Security School, her thoughts and awareness were greatly improved under the cultivation and education of the Party and the League. She has been tested in the practical anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. Recently, the General Assembly of the League Branch of the Public Security School has approved her request to join the League. At a conference, she was praised by the principal. The principal called on everyone to learn from her.

    在全国范围内开展反贪污、反浪费、
    反官僚主义的群众性的检举运动
　　北京市建筑工程公司领导干部
    还没有发动群众开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动
    编辑同志：北京市建筑工程公司领导干部不重视施工部的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，到现在为止，仍没有把群众发动起来。这个公司内部是有严重的贪污和浪费现象的。公司在改组前，毫无计划地在上海招聘了四百多技术人员。这些技术人员来北京后，没事可做，闲住了四个月。公司领导干部觉得这些人闲得不像话了，就叫他们根据一个工程草图，仓促施工，结果，这一工程全部返工了。各工地主任来公司开会时大吃大喝，每周一次，已形成制度。公司刘副经理送老婆去太原，借了三千万元，造假账报销了。刘并派人从北京运汽车到太原去，光运费就花了一百多万元。西郊五一一九工地采购员陈敏英贪污三千多万元，公司估算科科长张文辉把这件案子送给办公室杨主任处理。杨主任因为自己身上不干净，和陈敏英的关系又很好，就毫不关心这件事。五一一九工地某干部用公家的大车往外偷运物资，在中途被大车工人识破，并被扭回工地。工地领导干部对偷窃人民财产的盗贼不加追问，反而在几天后借口大车工人工作“不积极”，把工人开除了。
    公司的贪污、浪费情况虽然很严重，但领导干部却满不在乎。最近，某负责人曾说：“去年我们做了二千多亿元的生意，浪费一百亿元不算什么！”因此，他们不重视伟大的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的政治斗争。我希望有关机关赶快处理。

　　中华制砖厂负责干部应该检查官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：北京市公营中华制砖厂负责干部有官僚主义作风。比如：在修理三个马蹄窑时，郭经理不听工人意见，坚持要采用山西的修理法。这次工程化了一千二百万元。修好后，烧了四窑出十五万块坯子，有十三、四万块不能用。修大烟筒时，孙厂长不亲自下去监督，不依靠工人而依靠大把头赵子登，结果烟筒在修到十多丈高时便倒了。这次损失工料三亿多元，还砸坏了两个窑门。去年十二月五日，他们不经考虑，解雇十六个工人，共给了二百多万元的路费。但不久，他们又要这些工人回来，白白化了路费。自反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动在厂里展开后，工会要孙厂长担任节约检查委员会的主任。孙说：“反官僚主义也是反我，反浪费也是反我，我不参加。”经大家再三解释，孙才算答应了。在工人大会上，孙厂长光批评工人的缺点，对于自己的缺点一点也不提，引起工人很大的不满。我们建议孙厂长、郭经理对因官僚主义而造成的浪费，作深刻的检讨，以便今后搞好人民的企业。

　　中南有色金属管理局湖南分局
    领导干部应检查铺张浪费
    编辑同志：中南军政委员会工业部有色金属管理局湖南分局有严重浪费的现象。他们花了近百亿元的巨款，建了两座四层钢筋水泥的办公大楼。在建筑时，把许多新买来的相当好的民房以及落成不久的局长住宅拆除。浪费很大。为了满足局里少数人对京剧的兴趣，他们曾在长沙收罗了一批京剧票友，充当职员。他们每逢节日必大唱两三天，花费了很多的钱。有些人甚至因唱戏过晚，第二天上午在宿舍睡觉，不来办公，但领导干部却熟视无睹。在解放后，局里收购城市房屋数十幢，迫使南区许多租房住的职工迁居，一时造成长沙房荒和房价高涨的情况。长沙市各界人民代表会议通过了一项公家不应再购买民房的决议。但这个局不依规定，又买进一幢民房。他们知道这是违法行为，就策使房主用请房客吃酒等手段，让房客搬家。这个局的领导干部应对这些铺张浪费和不遵守政府法令的行为作深刻检讨。

　　各地国营贸易系统
    仓储工作有严重的浪费现象
    编辑同志：国营贸易系统的仓储工作，由于某些工作同志不研究保管的方法和物资的性能，不深入检查物资管理的情况，工作粗枝大叶，麻痹大意、敷衍了事，以致浪费了国家大批资财。
    有些作仓储工作的同志，因不好好学习业务，分不清什么是主要物资，什么是次要的物资，所以不能合理使用仓库，造成浪费。像河北省邯郸市百货公司去年按需要新建了十栋仓库，但保管的同志强调急需办公室和宿舍，把一栋仓库改作宿舍和办公室，两栋存放次要物资，反把主要物资堆在少数仓库中。结果仓库洋灰地因载量过重（超过安全保管高度百分之三十至五十），开裂下沉，储存的白糖一部分受热溶化，一部分受压结块。有些同志不调查研究情况，只凭经验办事。如南京市粮食公司仓库人员，根据过去保管稻谷经验，把小麦堆成通风垛，致使三千万斤小麦生虫。再如河北邯郸市粮食公司干部，把水分在百分之一三·四的红粮（在安全水分以下）翻晒了四十八万斤，浪费工资粮三千斤。有些同志单纯强调节约，不从大处着眼。如广州某仓库发现有三百七十六包大米已发热，将要变质，但负责保管的同志怕花钱，不肯改垛摊晒。南京市粮食公司的小麦生了虫，加工人员说：“虫子年年生，如果喷粉、翻堆、恐怕比虫吃的代价还要大。”结果因小失大，造成巨大损失。因工作人员麻痹大意，造成仓库失火、失盗的例子也不少。如华北进出口公司储运工作同志对商品性能认识不够，又不研究工作，把有毒品、易燃品和普通物资放在一起，结果搬运时不慎起火，除五百四十六人中毒外，还烧毁物资值八亿多元；重庆市李家沱沙市纱厂干部因麻痹大意，棉花仓库被特务放火烧毁，损失九亿七千三百多万元。
    以上情况，说明国营贸易系统的仓储工作中有严重的浪费现象，有关部门应该结合反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，深入检查，提出改进意见。

　　孟昭月揭发了爱人的贪污
    并坦白了自己的错误行为
    编辑同志：北京市公安学校学员孟昭月揭发了她的爱人陈祥的贪污行为，并坦白了她曾经同情、包庇吸大烟的人的事情。孟昭月同志的精神是值得学习的。
    陈祥是北京公安局的汽车司机，去年秋天，他押送犯人去热河。回京途中，他拉客乘车收费（数目不详）。他同司机助手关文元共贪污了人民币四十四万元（陈祥分得二十四万元，关文元分得二十万元）。陈祥把钱带回家并告诉了他的爱人孟昭月。孟昭月说：“你不把钱交还公家，上级知道了怎样办呢？”陈祥不但不以为错误，反而认为自己手段高明，以为自己不说，上级是不会知道的。孟昭月对这件事也就没有再理会。一九五一年三月，北京市公安局取缔一贯道时，陈祥把公安局没收的一贯道徒的大烟灰（一、二两），拿回家来，孟昭月不但不批评这种违法行为，反而把烟灰给了她姑父，并且接受了她姑父五万元。这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，孟昭月认识到她过去的行为是可耻的，是违法的。虽然，她的爱人陈祥已志愿参加了赴朝运输工作，可是，她还是向北京市公安局揭发了她丈夫过去的贪污情况，并且向北京市公安学校组织上坦白了她自己的错误行为。她还给爱人写信，要他坦白自己的错误和检举其他贪污分子。
    孟昭月入北京市公安学校后，在党、团的培养教育下，思想、觉悟大大地提高了。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中经受了实际考验。最近，公安学校团支部大会已通过她入团的请求。在一次大会上，她受到了校长的表扬。校长号召大家向她学习。
