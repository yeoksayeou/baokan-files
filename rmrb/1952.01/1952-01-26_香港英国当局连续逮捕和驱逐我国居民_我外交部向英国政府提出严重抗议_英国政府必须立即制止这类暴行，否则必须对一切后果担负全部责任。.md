    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, in view of the seriousness of the continuous arrests and deportations of Chinese residents by the British authorities in Hong Kong, hereby issues the following statement:
    According to a report from the Guangdong Provincial People's Government: From 4:00 AM to 11:00 AM on January 10, 1952, the British authorities in Hong Kong dispatched large numbers of armed police and plainclothes agents in armored vehicles, carrying submachine guns and various weapons, to surround the residences of eight Chinese film workers residing in Hong Kong: Sima Wensen, Ma Guoliang, Qi Wenshao, Liu Qiong, Shu Shi, Yang Hua, Shen Ji, and Di Fan, and arrested them. When they questioned the British police about the reasons for their arrest, the British police replied: "There is no reason, the Hong Kong government wants to arrest you, so they arrest you." They were not allowed to speak to their families, nor were they allowed to take any clothes or belongings, and they were forced to leave their residences with weapons. After being taken to the police station, they were escorted out of the country in batches. Those arrested and deported on the same day as Sima Wensen, and subsequently, included Chinese film artists Bai Chen and Jiang Wei, Li Wenxing, the general representative of the fire victims in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City, representatives Zhang Sheng, and Xian Peiling, the director of the Kowloon City branch of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Workers' General Union, and Secretary Yao Jian, and four other people who supported the victims of the village. Feng Qin, the chief of the Finance Division of the Tung Tau Tsuen fire victims representatives office, was kidnapped from his home by Hong Kong British government plainclothes detectives on January 16 and his whereabouts are still unknown. Tung Tau Tsuen in Kowloon City suffered a strange fire on November 21, 1951, with more than 16,000 Chinese residents suffering severe disasters. After the fire occurred, the British authorities in Hong Kong not only refused to provide relief, but also dispatched large numbers of soldiers and police to surround and arrest large numbers of victims, demolished the victim representatives office, seized all relief clothing sent by people from all walks of life, and finally arrested and deported Li Wenxing and others who represented the victims of the village in negotiations with the Hong Kong British authorities regarding the aftermath. According to reliable sources, the British authorities in Hong Kong are continuing to arrange similar terrorist atrocities against Chinese residents.
    According to a report from the Guangdong Provincial People's Government: Recently, the British government in Hong Kong has again allowed Chiang Kai-shek's remnants of Xiao Tianlai and other small groups of bandits to sneak into our territory from the border area between Hong Kong and Kowloon to harass residents, rob property, carry out explosions and sabotage, and distribute reactionary leaflets.
    The Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and the people of the whole country, have expressed great indignation at the above-mentioned series of persecutions and provocations by the British authorities in Hong Kong.
    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government believes that the above-mentioned series of events are by no means accidental local events, but a serious new development in the policy of the Government of the United Kingdom to antagonize the People's Republic of China. This new development is the result of the further oppression of the British Government by the US Government and the further submission of the Churchill Cabinet of the US Government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government hereby lodges a strong protest with the Government of the United Kingdom regarding the above-mentioned events, and demands that the Government of the United Kingdom must immediately stop such barbarous persecution of Chinese residents and acts of open provocation against the People's Republic of China, otherwise, the Government of the United Kingdom must bear full responsibility for all consequences.

    香港英国当局连续逮捕和驱逐我国居民
    我外交部向英国政府提出严重抗议
    英国政府必须立即制止这类暴行，否则必须对一切后果担负全部责任。
    【新华社二十五日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部鉴于香港英国当局连续逮捕和驱逐中国居民出境一事的严重性，特发表下列声明：
    据广东省人民政府报告：一九五二年一月十日上午四时到十一时，香港英国当局先后派出大批武装警察和便衣特务，乘坐冲锋车，携带冲锋枪及各种武器，分别包围居留香港的中国电影工作者司马文森、马国亮、齐闻韶、刘琼、舒适、杨华、沈寂、狄梵等八人的住所，并将他们逮捕。当他们向英警质问逮捕理由时，英警回答说：“没有理由，香港政府要逮捕你就逮捕你。”并且不准他们和家人说话，也不准携带任何衣服用品，就以武器胁迫他们离开住所。他们被押到警察署后，即被分批押解出境。与司马文森等同日及以后继续被逮捕并押解出境的，还有中国电影艺术工作者白沉、蒋伟，九龙城东头村火灾区灾民总代表李文兴、代表张生，及支援该村灾民要求的港九纺织染业总工会九龙城支会主任冼佩玲、书记姚坚等六人。东头村火灾区灾民代表办事处财政股股长冯钦在一月十六日被香港英国政府便衣警探从家中架走，至今下落不明。九龙东头村系于一九五一年十一月二十一日发生离奇的大火灾，遭受重灾的中国居民共达一万六千多人。该地火灾发生后，香港英国当局不但拒绝加以救济，并先后出动大批军警，包围并逮捕大批灾民，拆毁灾民代表办事处，抢走各界人民送来的全部救济衣物，最后并将代表该村灾民向香港英国当局交涉善后事宜的李文兴等人逮捕押解出境。根据可靠消息，香港英国当局仍在继续布置对中国居民的同类恐怖暴行。
    又据广东省人民政府报告：最近，香港英国政府又纵使蒋介石残匪萧天来等小股匪徒，从港九边境地区，潜入我境内骚扰居民，抢劫财物，实行爆炸破坏，散发反动传单。
    对于上述香港英国当局的一系列迫害和挑衅行为，港九地区的中国人民和全国人民，均已表示极大愤慨。
    中央人民政府外交部认为上述一系列事件，决不是偶然发生的地方性的事件，而是英国联合王国政府敌视中华人民共和国的政策的严重的新发展，这个新发展是美国政府进一步压迫英国政府而邱吉尔内阁则进一步向美国政府屈服的结果。中央人民政府外交部特就上述各事件向英国联合王国政府提出严重抗议，并要求英国联合王国政府必须立即制止这类蛮横迫害中国居民并向中华人民共和国公开挑衅的暴行，否则，英国联合王国政府必须对一切后果担负全部责任。　　　
　　一九五二年一月二十五日
