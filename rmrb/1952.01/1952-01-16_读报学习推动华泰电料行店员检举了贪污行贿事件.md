    Reading Newspaper Promotes Hua Tai Electrical Supplies Store Employees to Report Corruption and Bribery Cases

    Editor: At the beginning of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, we thought it was a matter for government agencies and state-owned enterprises and had nothing to do with us shop assistants. Because we could neither embezzle nor waste state property, let alone engage in bureaucracy. After repeated meetings and education by the shop's trade union, and our own continuous newspaper reading and learning, this erroneous understanding of ours has been basically reversed. After reading about many bribery cases in the industrial and commercial sectors in the newspapers, we gradually realized the close relationship between this movement and the industrial and commercial sectors. We took the case of our store manager, Geng Shiqiu, bribing a Comrade Wang from the Air Force Command in 1950 (already handled by the Beijing People's Court) as an example and launched a discussion. In the end, we clearly realized that this was an act of stealing national wealth. At this time, we exposed some bribery incidents that still exist. We remember ten incidents. Pei Tingxun from the Beijing Electric Power Bureau had business dealings with our store. He once asked our store to treat him to Peking duck at the Quanjude Restaurant. When Pei Tingxun moved, our store took the initiative to send him 50,000 yuan in gift certificates. Comrade Cai Gen from the North China Military Region (unit unspecified) bought goods from our store in February last year and wanted two White Elephant brand flashlights and six batteries. In November, he asked for two batteries in the name of "introducing business."

    Because these things were very small, some people had a wrong idea: "Let's forget it. Exposing it would be embarrassing for others, and they might secretly correct themselves. As for ourselves? Just don't do this kind of thing in the future, wouldn't that be enough?" In response to this ideological situation, the newspaper reading group further selected and read relevant documents. After reading the article "Secretly Correcting is Not Enough" published in the Workers' Daily on January 5, we felt that this idea was very inappropriate. Because not reporting corruption and bribery is not a patriotic act to protect national interests, because secretly correcting it is impossible to correct it cleanly. Those corrupt elements and bribers may still develop a fluke mentality and will inevitably make mistakes again in the future.

    We conducted an in-depth analysis of Comrade Cai Gen's behavior of greed for petty gains. We believe that if this behavior continues to develop, it will lead to corruption and degeneration. As far as we ourselves are concerned, this practice is essentially pulling cadres "into the water," which is harmful to the interests of the state and the people. The leader of the newspaper reading group, Xu Zizhen, examined his own thoughts and said:

    "In the past, I thought that giving gifts and treating buyers to meals was 'human affection' and to gain 'harmony'; on the contrary, I thought that those cadres who were law-abiding were not 'reasonable'. Through this study, I realized that giving gifts and eating meals are not good things." After everyone's thoughts were clarified, they systematically reported the bribery incidents they knew to the trade union organization.

    Some time ago, the Beijing Hardware Industry Shop Employees' Union held a meeting to expose capitalists' bribery and cadres' acceptance of bribes, and 85 cases of corruption and bribery were exposed on the spot, involving cadres from more than 70 agencies. This meeting fully demonstrated the spirit of our shop employees in resolutely fighting against thieves who harm the interests of the people and destroy national construction. In order to deepen this movement, our grassroots trade union plans to lead the newspaper reading group to study in a planned way, so that shop employees can strictly distinguish the boundaries between the corrupt thoughts of the bourgeoisie and ensure that they will expose all acts of capitalists and illegal cadres that harm the interests of the people at any time in the future.

    Editor's Note: After reading newspapers and studying, the shop employees of Hua Tai Electrical Supplies Store clarified their ideological boundaries, dispelled their concerns, and consciously reported corruption and bribery incidents, which is a patriotic act. All newspaper reading groups in various places should learn from this example in leading newspaper reading and studying, and mobilize the masses to bravely and actively report corruption and bribery incidents.

### 读报学习推动华泰电料行店员检举了贪污行贿事件

    读报学习推动华泰电料行店员检举了贪污行贿事件
    编辑同志：在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动刚刚开始的时候，我们认为这是政府机关和国营企业部门的事情，和我们店员无关。因为我们既不可能贪污浪费国家的财物，更谈不到什么官僚主义。经过店员工会多次开会教育，和自己不断地读报学习，我们这种错误认识，已经基本上扭转过来。看了报纸上登载的许多工商界行贿的案件，我们逐渐认识到这个运动和工商界的密切关系。大家拿本行经理耿实秋在一九五零年向空军司令部一位姓王的同志行贿的实例（已经北京市人民法院处理）展开了讨论，最后明确地认识到这就是盗窃国家财富的行为。这时候，我们就揭发了目前还存在着的一些行贿事件。只是我们记忆起来的就有十件。北京电业局裴庭勋和我行有买卖关系，他曾要求我行请他在全聚德饭店吃烤鸭，在裴庭勋搬家的时候，我行又主动地送给他五万元的礼券，华北军区蔡根同志（单位不详），去年二月间在本行购得货物后，要去白象牌手电筒两个，电池六节；十一月间，他又以“介绍买卖”为名，要去电池两节。
    因为这些事情都很小，有些人又产生了一种错误思想：“算了吧，揭发出来对别人‘面子’说不过去，他们自己也许会偷偷地改过来；我们自己呢？以后不要再做这种事，不就得了吗？”针对这种思想情况，读报组又进一步选读有关文件。读了工人日报一月五日登的“偷偷改过来是不行的”这篇文章，使我们感到这种想法很不妥当。因为不检举贪污行贿事件，就不是保护国家利益的爱国行为，因为偷偷地改，就不可能改得干净。那些贪污分子和行贿分子，还可能形成一种侥幸心理，将来免不了再犯错误。
    我们对蔡根同志那种贪图小便宜的行为，作了深入的分析。我们认为他这种行为，发展下去，就会走上腐化堕落的道路。在我们本身来说，这种作法，实质上就是拉干部“下水”，是违害国家和人民利益的。读报组长徐子珍检查自己的思想说：
    “在过去，我认为给买主送点礼，请顿饭，这是
    ‘人情’，讨个‘和气’；对那些奉公守法的干部反而认为他们不通‘情理’。通过这次学习，我才认识到什么送礼、吃饭都不是好事情。”大家的思想搞通了，就把所知道的贿赂事件，通过工会组织，系统地反映上去了。
    前些时，北京市五金业店员工会举行了一次检举资方行贿和干部受贿的大会，当场检举了八十五件贪污和行贿的事件，涉及七十多个机关的干部。这个大会充分表现了我们店员工人对危害人民利益、破坏国家建设的盗贼进行了坚决斗争的精神。为了把这个运动深入一步，我们基层工会准备有计划地领导读报组进行学习，使店员工人和资产阶级的腐化思想严格地分清界限，保证今后随时检举资方和非法干部的一切损害人民利益的行为。

    编者按：华泰电料行店员经过读报学习，划清了思想界限，解除了顾虑，自觉地检举了贪污和行贿的事件，这是一种爱国的举动。各地读报组在领导读报学习中，都应该学习这个榜样，动员群众勇敢地积极地检举贪污和行贿的事件。
