Following the conclusion of the Third Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, all sixteen districts in the urban and suburban areas held their respective district-level People's Representative Conferences. These conferences demonstrated that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Beijing has penetrated further into the broad masses of the people.

At these conferences, Mayor Peng Zhen's report at the Municipal Representative Conference "On Increasing Production and Practicing Economy, Opposing Corruption, Opposing Waste, and Opposing Bureaucracy" was conveyed. The representatives unanimously endorsed this report and expressed their determination to work for this struggle. Ren Junjie, a worker representative from the First District, said: "To do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy, we must eliminate these three enemies: corruption, waste, and bureaucracy." Wu Rui, a farmer representative from Bagou Village in the Thirteenth District, said: "We are working hard to increase production for the sake of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. If corrupt elements steal it, we won't have the energy to do it anymore. We must oppose corruption!" Zhang Zemin, director of the Federation of Industry and Commerce office in the Ninth District, expressed his firm support for this movement and pledged to lead by example, driving all industrial and commercial households to promote this movement. A resident representative from the Eighth District relayed an old lady's words, saying: "The anti-corruption movement is really good; Chairman Mao is most afraid of our common people suffering losses."

At this conference, some heads of units made public self-criticisms and reported on the internal situation of their organizations in carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle. Their reports dispelled the concerns of many representatives, increased their courage to report and confess, and strengthened their confidence in the movement. At the People's Representative Conference of the Twelfth District, a total of fifty-two village cadres confessed their problems. Wang Xin, the village chief of Guantou Village, after repeated ideological struggles, confessed that he had embezzled more than a hundred catties of public grain in 1950 when he was the village financial and grain committee member. Guan Shusen, a police officer from the Second Sub-bureau of the Internal Affairs Bureau, confessed to his extortion. Zhang Yinting, manager of the Chunji Iron Factory in the Ninth District, confessed to his bribery.

The representatives present expressed extreme hatred for corrupt elements who steal state wealth and all wasteful phenomena. At the People's Representative Conference of the Seventh District, more than fifty people denounced corrupt elements on the spot. Worker representatives from the First District denounced nine cases of corruption on the spot. Worker representatives from the Fifth District denounced a car company manager for seeking exorbitant profits by buying stolen gasoline from drivers at low prices. He said: "This manager is afraid of us denouncing him, so he makes cotton clothes for us workers and pays double wages, but we workers will never be fooled and will resolutely denounce him!" At the conference in the Tenth District, there were twelve reports of corruption by district and village cadres. The Guanxiang Street representatives in this district also denounced Ma Zhen, a police officer from the police station, for extorting more than two million yuan from citizens. Zhang Deshou, a resident representative from the Fifth District, denounced Li Jiaxun, a district representative, for using his representative authority to engage in corruption and embezzlement. The entire delegation in this district unanimously voted to revoke Li Jiaxun's qualification as a representative.

The representatives fully discussed ways to mobilize the masses and decided to mobilize all activists to conduct door-to-door propaganda. The conference decided that after the district People's Representative Conference, street People's Representative Conferences and village People's Representative Conferences should be held separately to universally implement the spirit of the district representative conference, further deepen the movement, and ensure that it is known to every household. In addition, it was decided to set up denunciation reception stations in the district government and denunciation boxes in front of each police station, etc. The representatives all pledged to assist the government in carrying out this movement, mobilize the masses to actively participate in this struggle, break down all sentiments and concerns, resolutely denounce all acts of corruption and bribery, and clear the obstacles for carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. Many representatives decided to include "Actively Participate in the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement" in their patriotic pacts. (City)

    北京市十六个区分别召开人民代表会议
    许多代表当场检举贪污舞弊的罪犯
    决定动员所有积极分子挨户宣传反贪污反浪费
    在北京市第三届各界人民代表会议第三次会议闭幕以后，城郊共十六个区都分别召开了区各界人民代表会议。这些会议显示出北京市的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动普遍在广大的人民群众中深入了一步。
    在这些会议上都传达了彭真市长在市代表会上“关于增产节约、反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义”的报告。代表们对这个报告一致拥护。表示决心为这一斗争而努力。第一区工人代表任俊杰说：“要做好增产节约，一定要消灭贪污、浪费和官僚主义这三个敌人。”第十三区巴沟村农民代表武瑞说：“我们为抗美援朝努力增产，要是贪污分子给盗窃了，我们就没劲再干了。一定要反贪污！”第九区工商联办事处主任张泽民表示坚决拥护这一运动，并要以身作则，带动所有工商户推动这一运动。第八区一个居民代表转述一个老大娘的话说：“反贪污运动真好，毛主席就怕咱们老百姓吃亏。”
    在这次会议上，有一些单位的首长作了公开检讨，并报告了机关内部进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的情况。他们的报告给很多代表解除了顾虑，增加了他们检举和坦白的勇气和对运动的信心。在十二区的各界人民代表会议上，交代问题的村干部，共有五十二人。管头村村长王鑫经过反复的思想斗争，坦白出他在一九五○年任村财粮委员时，贪污公粮百余斤的事实。内二分局民警关树森坦白了他的勒索行为。第九区纯记铁工厂经理张荫亭坦白了他的行贿行为。
    到会代表对盗窃国家财富的贪污分子和一切浪费现象表示极度憎恨。在第七区的各界人民代表会议上，有五十多人当场检举了贪污分子；第一区工人代表当场检举了九起贪污案；第五区工人代表检举了一个汽车行经理贪图暴利，贱价收买司机偷窃的汽油的事。他说：“这个经理害怕我们检举，给我们工人做棉衣、发双薪，但我们工人决不上钩，坚决要检举他！”在第十区会议上，检举区、村干部贪污的事有十二件。这个区关厢街代表还检举了派出所民警麻镇敲诈勒索市民二百多万元的事实。第五区居民代表张德寿检举了区代表李嘉勋利用代表职权贪污舞弊。这个区全体代表一致通过：撤消李嘉勋的代表资格。
    代表们充分地讨论了动员群众的办法，决定发动所有积极分子，挨门挨户地宣传。会议上决定：在区人民代表会议开过后，分别召开街人民代表会议，村人民代表会议，普遍贯彻区代表会议的精神，使运动更深入下去，务必做到家喻户晓。此外还决定在区政府内设立检举接待站、在各派出所门前设立检举箱等。代表们都纷纷保证一定要协助政府搞好这个运动，发动群众积极参加这个斗争，破除一切情面和顾虑，坚决检举各种贪污、行贿的行为，为开展增产节约运动扫清障碍。很多代表都决定把“积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动”订到自己的爱国公约里去。　（市）
