The Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department has decided to continue to deepen the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in its affiliated factories, mines, schools, and government offices. On January 11th, the Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department convened an emergency mobilization meeting, where Minister Wang Heshou delivered a mobilization report. Wang Heshou pointed out: This movement has been going on for four months in the industrial department system and has achieved great results; however, the movement is not deep enough and the scope is too small. In the past, it was mainly carried out in the Industrial Department headquarters and the bureaus and companies; and even within these agencies, many units have not carried it out in depth, especially those dead corners that are usually not paid attention to, such as some purchasing departments, which have not been touched at all. As for the factories and mines, they have basically not yet started. Therefore, the Industrial Department has decided to change the central work of the factories and mines in January, that is, to postpone the mass inspection of workshop technical management and the summarization and promotion of advanced experience, which were originally scheduled to be carried out in January, so that the Industrial Department and all factories, mines, and departments can concentrate their efforts on carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement under the condition of ensuring normal production. In factories and mines, the focus of the movement should be on management cadres, staff, and technicians. Among the working masses, the focus should be on mobilizing them to report corruption and waste and to expose waste in production, and to mobilize them to come up with more rational measures to improve product quality, increase production, and save more wealth for the country. Do not indiscriminately carry out confession movements among the working masses. When carrying out this work, administrative cadres at all levels must maintain a unified pace with the CCP Party Committee, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, and cooperate in doing it. If it is not done well, administrative cadres will be severely punished by the Industrial Department. Each bureau, each company, and each department of the Industrial Department should divide its leadership into two parts. One part will remain in the agency to personally lead the movement in the agency to make the movement more in-depth; the other part will lead personnel who have undergone preliminary rectification in the agency to go down to help the factories and mines carry out the movement. The entire Industrial Department will organize more than a thousand people into several inspection teams to go to various factories and mines to help carry out this struggle. In short, a tight net must be woven so that no department or individual is left out of the movement. (Xinhua News Agency)

    东北工业部决定深入进行反贪污浪费斗争
    要组成一张严密的网不使有一个部门一个人漏在运动之外
    东北人民政府工业部决定在所属各厂矿、学校、机关中继续深入进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争。十一日，东北人民政府工业部召开紧急动员会议，由部长王鹤寿作动员报告。王鹤寿指出：这一运动在工业部系统中已经进行了四个月，得到了很大成绩；但是运动还不深，范围还太小。过去主要是在工业部本部及各管理局、公司的机关中进行；而且就在这些机关中，还有很多单位搞得不深，特别是平常不大注意的那些死角，如某些采购部门还根本未动。至于在厂矿中，基本上尚未展开。因此，工业部决定将一月份厂矿的中心工作加以变更，即将原来规定在一月份进行的车间技术管理的群众性检查和总结推广先进经验等工作推迟，以便从工业部到各厂矿各部门能够在保障正常生产的条件下集中力量进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。在厂矿中，运动的重点应放在管理干部、职员和技术人员中间。在工人群众中间，应以发动他们检举贪污、浪费分子和揭发生产上的浪费为主，发动他们想出更多的合理措施来提高产品质量，增加生产，为国家节约更多的财富。不要在工人群众中不加区别地乱搞坦白运动。在进行这项工作时，各级行政干部一定要和中共党委、工会、青年团统一步调，协同来作。如果作不好，行政干部要受到工业部的严厉处分。各管理局、各公司和工业部各处，要把领导力量分成两部分。一部分留在机关中亲自领导本机关的运动，使运动更深入；一部分要带领机关中已经经过初步整风的人员下去帮助厂矿开展运动。全工业部要组织千余人成为若干检查队，到各厂矿中去帮助开展这一斗争。总之，要织成一张严密的网，不使一个部门、一个人漏在运动之外。（新华社）
