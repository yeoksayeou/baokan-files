    Record of the Taiyuan City Anti-Corruption Struggle Broadcast Rally
    Wu Xiang, Zhao Zhengjing
    The anti-corruption struggle broadcast rally on January 8th rapidly propelled the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, which had been underway in Taiyuan City for over twenty days, to a climax. It sounded the clarion call for a sworn expedition, launching a vigorous and swift general assault on the national criminals who were guilty of corruption, bribery, theft of state property, and sabotage of policies and laws. This rally was grand in scale, filled with righteousness, and swept away all evil tendencies. The more than two thousand three hundred cadres and representatives from industry and commerce who attended the meeting took action, and the 170,000 listeners who tuned into the broadcast took action. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the 500,000 people of the city will actively participate in this great struggle to cleanse away the poisons left over from the old society!
    
    Leadership's Determination, the People's Power
    Mayor Han Chunde appeared on the front lines of this struggle with a fighting posture. He personally directed the operations, implementing Chairman Mao's determination with practical actions. He praised the responsible cadres of the Tax Bureau and the Construction Bureau for actively leading the movement, and severely criticized the Director of the Health Bureau, Liu Zhenhua, and the Director of the Taiyuan City Cooperative, Deng Zhibin, for not actively leading the movement, warning them to change their ways within a time limit, or face dismissal and investigation. Yang Zezhong, Director of the Sixth Public Security Sub-bureau, was found to have embezzled a prisoner's watch and suppressed democracy and attempted to retaliate after being reported. He was immediately announced to be dismissed from his post. Jia Yingwen, a major corruption criminal who refused to confess, stole stockpiled flour intended for burning and sold it to harm the people, and stole gold rings, silver dollars, and other items from the inventory, causing the loss of over 100 million yuan in state property. Mayor Han proposed that Jia be severely punished on the spot. These correct and decisive measures greatly stimulated the masses' enthusiasm and courage to struggle. The meeting place boiled, and every microphone was abuzz. Reports and accusations were handed to the rostrum one after another. The liaison station's telephone never stopped ringing, with over 470 calls and 514 letters linking the rally with the 170,000 radio listeners. People's representatives from all walks of life in the city and more than 3,300 propagandists were mobilized, immediately exposing and reporting 227 cases of corruption and waste, and 68 people voluntarily confessed. While listening, the Taiyuan Machine Factory reported ten corrupt individuals. Jia Yinwu, a student at Taiyuan Middle School, demanded that the government severely punish his brother, the corrupt criminal Jia Yingwen. Yang Jinwen, a student at Jinshan Middle School, confessed that he had hidden gold bars that should have been confiscated from his counter-revolutionary father and requested the government to take them. Residents of No. 22 Dudong Street reported that Yin Zhesheng, a cadre of the Civil Affairs Bureau living in the same courtyard, had embezzled 8 million yuan. Six hundred and ninety-one listening units responded to Mayor Han's call and expressed their determination to the rally; the Steel Factory workers' listening group also made three resolutions. Cadres of the Health Bureau wrote letters expressing their acceptance of Mayor Han's criticism and their determination to help leading cadres to develop the movement. A letter came from the shop assistant of the private Wenbaozhai store, and letters also came from patriotic Catholic priests and nuns. One letter pointed out that the Shanxi Grand Theater did not listen to the rally broadcast but played other songs instead, and the person in charge should make a self-criticism. The masses have risen up, and vulgar and decadent liberalism cannot exist.
    
    Two Paths for Corrupt Elements
    Four major corrupt elements who refused to confess were brought to the stage. Shi Qinxia, a staff member of the Industrial and Mining Section of the Municipal Industry Bureau, was a cadre with eight years of work experience, but he had completely degenerated. He used his position to collude with unscrupulous merchants, defraud state loans, hoard materials, engage in speculation and profiteering, lend money at usurious rates, and even extort, blackmail, and sell drugs and gold, doing everything. He embezzled more than 20 million yuan in total. He had been refusing to confess, always thinking that he was clever, had methods and means, and could hide and escape. It was not until he was brought to the stage that he still wanted to maintain his dignity, twisting and hiding behind. A guard comrade pushed him unceremoniously, and he lowered his head.
    
    When the Director of the Taiyuan Municipal People's Supervisory Committee publicly exposed Shi Qinxia's crimes, the masses could no longer tolerate it and all raised their angry fists and shouted:
    "Take off his badge, we don't recognize this kind of cadre!"
    "Demand that the government severely punish corrupt elements who refuse to confess and arrest him on the spot!"
    The badge was taken off, and his hands were tied up. Shi Qinxia was so frightened that his face was as white as earth and he trembled all over. But angry people still went to the stage one after another, relentlessly exposing how this fake "director" wore the cloak of a revolutionary cadre to do so many despicable and dirty things, exposing his greedy black heart and ugly state.
    
    The corrupt element Zhang Rang used threats and inducements to prevent Zhang Yuji from confessing, attacked activists, organized small cliques, and confronted the leadership. Zhang Yuji exposed and confessed all of this at the rally. As a result, Zhang Rang was arrested and sent to the government for legal action, while Zhang Yuji, because of his sincere repentance and voluntary request for punishment, was determined to atone for his crimes and was welcomed by the masses. Subsequently, Jia Yunji and Zhai Huijin, staff members of the Municipal Tax Bureau, Wang Wenwei, head of the General Affairs Section of the Workers' Hospital, and Zhang Zihe, technician of the Workers' Photography Studio, also confessed their corruption crimes on the spot and reported another eight corrupt elements. As a result, they were also welcomed by the masses. The masses agreed to reduce their sentences.
    
    All corrupt elements must know: Thorough confession is the only way out, and refusal to confess will only increase the guilt.
    
    Report and Expose the "Factory Directors Who Manufacture Sugar-Coated Bullets"
    Mayor Han clarified the government's policy of protecting the legitimate operations of industrialists and businessmen at the meeting, and at the same time condemned the illegal activities of some industrialists and businessmen, such as bribery, fraud, tax evasion, and excessive profits. He pointed out sharply that some people are "factory directors who specialize in manufacturing sugar-coated bullets," using despicable means to corrupt state workers and drag cadres into the water. Such people must be punished.
    
    Wu Zhiping, the manager of the private Xinxin Cotton Weaving Factory, is such a "factory director who specializes in manufacturing sugar-coated bullets." In order to achieve the purpose of stealing state property, he bribed cadres a dozen times in a row, even going so far as to introduce his sister to Shi Qinxia to seduce and corrupt him, so as to further collude with each other and engage in speculation and profiteering. Guo Yu, the manager of the private Huaji Construction Factory, is also such a "factory director who specializes in manufacturing sugar-coated bullets," who has bribed eighteen cadres. They all made self-exposures at the rally. From their self-exposures, it can be seen how close the relationship between industrialists and businessmen and corrupt elements is! To completely and thoroughly eradicate the accumulated evils of corruption, it is necessary to launch a struggle against bribery in the industrial and commercial circles. The two cadres of the Taiyuan Municipal Tax Bureau who accepted bribes alone revealed more than sixty bribery households in thirteen industries. But there are indeed some people in the industrial and commercial circles who regard illegal activities such as bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state assets as their special skills and are complacent about them. They should confess quickly. If they refuse to confess and are reported in the future, they will become street rats that everyone shouts and beats.
    
    The general offensive against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy by the people of Taiyuan City has begun. They will achieve great victories on this new front opened up by Chairman Mao!

    记太原市反贪污斗争广播大会
    吴象　赵正晶
    一月八日的反贪污斗争广播大会，把太原市已经进行了二十多天的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动迅速推进到高潮。它吹起了誓师进军的号角，大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地对贪污、行贿、盗窃国家财产、破坏政策法令的国家罪人进行了总讨伐。这个大会声势浩大，正气冲天，使歪风扫地。到会的两千三百多干部和工商界代表行动起来了，收听广播的十七万听众行动起来了。全市五十万人民，将在共产党和人民政府的领导下，积极参加这场伟大的斗争，把旧社会遗留下来的污毒洗刷干净！
    领导的决心，群众的力量
    韩纯德市长以战斗的姿态，出现在这场斗争的最前线。他亲自指挥作战，用实际行动贯彻毛主席的决心。他表扬了积极领导运动的税务局和建设局的负责干部，严厉地批评了不积极领导运动的卫生局局长刘振华和太原市合作社主任邓沚宾，并警告他们要限期转变，否则撤职查办。公安六分局局长杨泽中贪污犯人的手表，被检举后还压制民主，企图报复，当场被宣布撤职。拒不坦白的大贪污犯贾英文，把政府没收下库存着准备焚烧的料面，盗卖出去危害人民，并盗窃库存的金戒指、银洋等物，使国家财产损失一亿多元。韩市长当场提出予贾犯以严惩。这些正确的果断的措施，大大激发了群众斗争的热情和勇气。会场沸腾起来了，每一个广播筒前都沸腾起来了。检举、揭发的条子一张又一张地递上主席台。联系站的电话始终没有停过，四百七十多次电话和五百一十四封信把大会和十七万广播听众联成了一片。全市各界人民代表和三千三百多个宣传员都出动了，当场揭发、检举贪污、浪费案件二百二十七起，自动坦白的六十八人。在收听中，太原机器厂就检举出十个贪污分子。太原中学学生贾印武要求政府给他哥哥——贪污犯贾英文以严厉惩办。进山中学学生杨晋文，坦白自己藏下了反革命爸爸应被没收的金条，请求政府接收。都督东街二十二号居民收听组检举出住在同院的民政局干部尹哲生贪污八百万元。有六百九十一个收听单位响应韩市长的号召，向大会表示了自己的决心；钢铁厂职工收听组并做出三条决议。卫生局干部写信表示接受韩市长批评，一定要帮助领导干部把运动展开。私营文宝斋店员的信来了，爱国的天主教神父、修女的信也来了。有一封信提出山西大戏院不收听大会广播，却放送其他歌曲，负责人应作检讨，群众起来了，庸俗腐朽的自由主义存在不住了。
    贪污分子的两条道路
    四个拒不坦白的大贪污分子被拉到台上。市工业局工矿科主任科员石沁霞，是一个有八年工作历史的干部，但已完全变质。他竟利用职权，勾结奸商，骗取国家贷款，囤积物资，投机倒把，放高利贷，甚至敲诈勒索，贩卖毒品、黄金，无所不为。前后共贪污二千多万元。他一直拒不坦白，总以为他聪明，有办法，有手段，瞒得住，躲得过。直到被拉到台上，还想保持自己的体面，忸忸怩怩躲躲闪闪地藏到后边。警卫同志不客气地推了他一把，他才垂下了头。
    当太原市人民监察委员会主任把石沁霞的罪恶公开揭发出来的时候，群众再也不能忍耐了，一齐举着愤怒的拳头高喊：
    “把他的证章摘下来，我们不承认这号干部！”
    “要求政府严惩拒不坦白的贪污分子，把他当场逮捕起来！”
    证章摘下来了，手绑起来了，石沁霞吓得面如白土，浑身颤抖。但是愤怒的人们，还是一个接一个走上台去，无情地揭发这个冒牌的“主任”，怎样披着革命干部的外衣，去干那许多下流的龌龊的勾当，使他贪婪的黑心和丑态暴露无遗。
    贪污分子张让，用威胁利诱的办法，阻止张裕基坦白，打击积极分子，组织小集团，和领导对抗。张裕基在大会上把这一切都揭发、坦白出来了。结果，张让被捆送政府法办，而张裕基却由于真诚悔过，自请处分，决心立功赎罪，受到了群众的欢迎。接着，市税务局科员贾云集翟恢晋、工人医院总务科长王文蔚、工人摄影社技师张子和也都当场坦白自己的贪污罪行，并检举了另外八个贪污分子。因此，也受到了群众的欢迎。群众同意对他们减轻处分。
    一切贪污分子必须知道：彻底坦白是唯一出路，拒不坦白只有加重罪责。
    检举、揭发“制造糖衣炮弹的厂长”
    韩市长在会上阐明了政府保护工商业者正当经营的政策，同时斥责了部分工商业者行贿、欺诈、偷税漏税、暴利等不法行为。他尖锐地指出某些人是“专门制造糖衣炮弹的厂长”，用卑鄙的手段腐蚀国家工作人员，拖干部下水。这样的人必须受到处分。
    私营新新棉织厂的经理武治平，就是这样一个“专门制造糖衣炮弹的厂长”。他为了达到窃取国家财产的目的，曾一连十数次地向干部行贿，甚至不惜把自己的妹妹介绍给石沁霞，来引诱他，腐化他，以便进一步互相勾结，投机倒把。私营华记营造厂经理郭瑜，也是这样一个“专门制造糖衣炮弹的厂长”，曾向十八个干部行贿。他们都在大会上作了自我揭发。从他们的自我揭发中可以看到：工商界和贪污犯有何等密切的关系！要完全地、彻底地铲除贪污的积害，必须在工商界展开反行贿的斗争。只太原市税务局两个受贿的干部，就揭发出十三个行业的六十多户行贿。但是工商界的确还有这样一部分人，把行贿、偷漏税、盗窃国家资财等不法行为，当作自己特殊的本领而洋洋自得。他们应该赶紧坦白，如果拒不坦白，将来被检举出来，将会变成人人喊打的过街老鼠。
    全太原市人民反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的总攻击战开始了，他们将在毛主席新开辟的这条战线上，取得伟大的胜利！
