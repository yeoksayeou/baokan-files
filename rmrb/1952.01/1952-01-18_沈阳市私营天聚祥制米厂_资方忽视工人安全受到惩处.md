    Shenyang Private Tianjuxiang Rice Mill
    Capitalists Punished for Neglecting Worker Safety

    Editor: The capitalists of the Shenyang private Tianjuxiang Rice Mill did not pay attention to safety equipment, causing a worker's death. On November 17th of last year, worker Song Yushan was hanging a leather belt in the workshop when the sleeve of his clothing was caught by a protruding part of the belt nail, becoming entangled on the shaft. At that time, another worker immediately pulled the power switch, but the 50-horsepower electric roller needed time to stop. As a result, most of Song Yushan's clothes were shredded and wrapped around the shaft. Song Yushan was thrown to the ground, unconscious. The factory sent him to the hospital for treatment, but he died the next morning due to his severe injuries. The main reason for the accident was the poor safety equipment in the factory. For example, the upright belt did not have a safety belt groove; there was no safety platform when hanging the belt; the belt joint should have used belt clips, but this factory used belt nails, and their protruding parts were not flattened. The crimes of the factory's manager, Nie Zhencheng, and factory director, Bian Depu, in disregarding workers' lives have been punished by the Municipal People's Court according to law.

    沈阳市私营天聚祥制米厂
    资方忽视工人安全受到惩处
    编辑同志：沈阳市私营天聚祥制米厂资方不重视安全设备，造成工人死亡事故。去年十一月十七日，工人宋玉山在场房里挂皮带，他的衣服袖子被皮带钉突出部分挂住，绞缠在轴杆上。当时，另一个工人立刻把电门拉开，但五十马力的电滚每分钟要转八百多转，不能立刻停止。结果，宋玉山的大部分衣服全被绞碎缠在轴杆上，宋玉山被甩在地上，昏迷不省人事。厂里把他送往医院治疗，因伤势过重，在第二天早晨即死亡。发生事故的主要原因是这个厂的安全设备不好。比如直立皮带没有安全皮带槽子；挂皮带时没有安全登板；皮带接头应用皮带卡子，而这个厂却用皮带钉，且其突出部分也没有割平。这个厂的经理聂振成和厂长边德普忽视工人生命的罪行，已由市人民法院依法惩处。
