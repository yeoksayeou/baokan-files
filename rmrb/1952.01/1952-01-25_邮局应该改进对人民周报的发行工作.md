    The Post Office Should Improve the Distribution of *People's Weekly*

    Editor: To meet the needs of readers, you have specially published *People's Weekly* so that readers who cannot afford to subscribe to the *People's Daily* can see the main content of the *People's Daily* at a very small cost. We are very grateful for this. However, we would like to raise two points regarding the distribution of *People's Weekly* for the post office to study and improve.

    First, the distribution speed is very slow. For example, in Shenyang and Suzhou, it takes a week after the publication of the journal to see it. Even in Tongxian, which is less than half a day's journey from Beijing, it takes three or four days, or even a week, to see it. These places cannot receive the publications in a timely manner, which greatly affects readers' studies.

    Second, there are many errors such as missed deliveries and backlogs. For example, a comrade from the Civil Engineering Hospital of the Shandong Daoshu Zheng Yi Committee who subscribed to *People's Weekly* received two issues together more than 20 days after the publication of the journal. Another example is that the Dezhou Prefectural United Normal School Library subscribed to *People's Weekly* for half a year, and five of the ten issues were not received. There are many such errors. We asked the post office that handles subscriptions why they made mistakes or delivered late, and they were all baffled and did not know where the delay occurred. We hope that the higher-level authorities of the post office will conduct a thorough inspection and improve it to benefit readers' studies.

    邮局应该改进对人民周报的发行工作
    编辑同志：你们为了照顾读者的需要，特别出版了人民周报，使无力订阅人民日报的读者，花费极小的代价，就能看到人民日报的主要内容。这是我们非常感激的。但是对于发行人民周报的工作，我们却要提出两点意见，以供邮局研究改进。
    一、发行的速度很慢。譬如在沈阳、苏州，要在刊物出版的一个星期之后才能看到。就是在距离北京不到半天路程的通县，也要三、四天，甚至一个星期才能看到。这些地方不能及时收到刊物，使读者在学习上受到很大的影响。
    二、漏送、积压等差错现象很多。如山东导沭整沂委员会民工医院某同志订的人民周报，都是在刊物出版二十多天之后，两期一齐送去。又如德州专区联立师范图书室订了半年人民周报，发了十期，就有五期没有收到。像这样差错的现象是很多的。我们问订报的邮局为什么把刊物弄错或送迟了，他们都莫名其妙，也不知道迟误发生在那里。我们希望邮局的上级机关好好检查一下，并加以改进，以利读者学习。
