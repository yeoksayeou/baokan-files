    Beijing Municipal Public and Private Property Management Bureau:
    Leading Cadres Should Examine Extravagance and Waste
    To the Editor: There is extravagance and waste in the Beijing Municipal Public and Private Property Management Bureau, especially in "treating guests and giving gifts."
    The Architectural Office under the Property Management Bureau spent more than 6.6 million yuan on entertaining guests between January and October 1951, of which more than 1.2 million yuan was used to "entertain" the section chiefs of the Property Management Bureau. The former Kyoto Public Goods Exchange, which belonged to the Property Management Bureau, spent more than 5.9 million yuan on treating guests and dining out between January and July 1951; during the New Year, gifts were given to the bureau director and division chiefs of the Property Management Bureau, costing more than 800,000 yuan. This amount was spent using falsified receipts. The Public Goods Exchange sold materials from the warehouse that were not accounted for, earning more than 700,000 yuan, and treated the internal cadres to "Peking duck." The Architectural Office under the Property Management Bureau, during the celebration of the completion of the workers' dormitory in February 1951 (during the Spring Festival) alone, spent more than 6.8 million yuan on dinners, performances, and dances; the related transportation costs were not even included.
    I hope that the leading cadres of the Beijing Municipal Property Management Bureau will examine extravagance and waste.

    北京市公逆产清管局
    领导干部应检查铺张浪费
    编辑同志：北京市公逆产清管局在“请客、送礼”等方面，有铺张浪费的现象。
    清管局所属建筑事务所，在一九五一年一月到十月间，请客费开支了六百六十多万元，其中“招待”清管局各科长共用了一百二十多万元。原属清管局的京都公易行，在一九五一年一月到七月间，请客、会餐共用五百九十多万元；在过年的时候，给清管局的局长、处长送礼，开支八十多万元；这笔款是用假造单据的方法开支的。公易行变卖了仓库中没有账号的物资，得款七十多万元，请行内干部吃了“烤鸭子”。清管局所属建筑事务所，只一九五一年二月间（春节时）庆祝工人宿舍完工的大会时，聚餐、演戏、开舞会，共用了六百八十多万元，有关交通费还没有计算在内。
    我希望北京市清管局的领导干部，检查铺张浪费。
