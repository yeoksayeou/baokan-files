    Liang Naitong (gatekeeper of the Second Business Department of Changchun Coal Industry Construction Materials Company) used to be a worker. In the early days of becoming a gatekeeper, he was ideologically pure, worked actively, was conscientious and responsible, and was very satisfied with his job.

    How Liang Naitong was Dragged Down by the Corrupt Element Wang Luyi
    In the spring of 1951, Wang Luyi (the mastermind of the corruption, from a landlord background, who had lived in a police school and served as a police chief under the puppet Manchukuo regime), who issued invoices in the Second Business Department, colluded with coal deliveryman Bai Dianqi and private merchants from the sales agency to steal coal. However, they still had to get past the gatekeeper. Wang then launched an attack on Liang Naitong. The first time, he tried to win Liang over, saying, "Isn't it uncomfortable to be short of money?" Liang said, "What can you do if you don't have money!" Wang said, "Haul coal out." But Liang refused. The second time, Wang said to Liang, "Look how well someone dresses, with a watch and leather shoes. Look at what you're wearing! How about hauling some coal out?" Liang still didn't agree. After that, Wang would say to Liang whenever he saw him, "Money is easy to spend, can you work in the Coal Construction Company for the rest of your life?" Over time, Liang Naitong wavered, was dragged down by Wang, and colluded with four sales agencies to haul coal out twice. Wang secretly stole the money allocated to Liang. Liang was furious and wanted to quit, but Wang threatened Liang, "If you quit, I'll 'doulu' (expose) everything you've done!" Liang had a guilty conscience and had to continue working with him. In this way, they became more and more deeply involved, hauling tons and tons of the state's coal out of the coal yard and selling it to private merchants at low prices. A total of 63 tons (two train cars) of coal were hauled out, causing the state to lose 89 million RMB.

    How Corrupt Elements and Unscrupulous Merchants Sabotaged Liang Naitong's Confession
    When the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began, Liang had a preliminary understanding that corruption was the most shameful behavior, and he wanted to confess and expose; but he had concerns, fearing that he would be sent to court after speaking out. Therefore, the "talk" or "not talk" struggle was going on in his mind, and he felt uneasy every day. Wang saw through Liang's mood and arranged for other corrupt elements and unscrupulous merchants to shake Liang's determination to confess. Especially whenever the administrative side held a large-scale mobilization meeting, either corrupt elements would come to win Liang over, or unscrupulous merchants would come to threaten Liang, hindering Liang's confession.

    The first time the Industry and Commerce Bureau held a conference, Mayor Shen said at the conference: "Those who sincerely confess will receive a reduced punishment; retaliation against those who expose others will not be allowed, and those who retaliate will be severely punished." After the meeting, Liang wanted to confess his own problems. Wang saw that Liang was about to confess and invited Liang to a small restaurant after the meeting, asking Liang, "What do you want to do?" Liang: "Confess!" Wang said: "Don't listen to Mayor Shen's report, he is a habitual liar, don't be fooled." And said, "I won't talk even if a knife is pressed against my neck; as long as you don't talk, no one can talk." As a result, Liang's determination to confess was shaken. Liang said:
    "I won't talk either." Wang didn't believe it and wanted Liang to swear an oath. Liang said: "If I talk, I'm your son." From then on, whenever Wang saw that Liang's ideological struggle was intense and his mood was not high, he would say, "What, do you want to be my son again?" Using these words to stimulate Liang, making him afraid to confess.

    The second time the Industry and Commerce Bureau held a conference, the Director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, Lan Yongcheng, and the Chief of the Processing Section, Cheng Kun, reviewed their mistakes at the conference. Liang Naitong thought: "These veteran cadres dare to talk about their own problems, I must talk about my problems." But after the meeting, Wang Luyi found Liang again and said: "What are you planning to do this time?" Liang said: "You see that Director Lan and Section Chief Cheng have talked about their problems, why don't we talk about our problems? Let's go talk together." Wang said: "If you confess, you will definitely be sent to court, at least three to five years in prison." Liang said: "The People's Government has a lenient policy." Wang said: "The Communist Party is the same old trick, first giving you sweet dates, then skinning you." Then unscrupulous merchants also came to Liang Naitong, and other corrupt elements also came to Liang Naitong. Some unscrupulous merchants said: "You must not talk, talking will implicate many people, what good will it do you?" Among them was an unscrupulous merchant, Li Shaoxian, who had just been released by the government under leniency and was a counter-revolutionary, who used both soft and hard tactics to sabotage Liang's confession: "I was just released by the government with leniency, you must not talk, I'll kowtow to you." After saying this, seeing that Liang ignored him, he said again: "You know that I have engaged in counter-revolution (Liang was an activist during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries), if you confess our affairs, I will bite you and say that you and I have been engaged in counter-revolution together." Fu Hongying (female), who collectively embezzled with Liang, also wrote a letter to Liang to meet at the cinema, arranging not to let Liang confess. In this way, Liang didn't dare to talk again.

    The third time the Industry and Commerce Bureau held a conference, six people were dealt with, Guan Fengdi, Wang Anyu, and Wu Tingchen, who refused to confess and jointly sabotaged the movement with unscrupulous merchants, were sent to the court for handling; Sun Jie, a party member who was not honest and sincerely confessed his mistakes, was expelled from the party and removed from his post for investigation; Liu Yizhi and Zheng Lixin, who confessed themselves and exposed others, were exempted from punishment. At the meeting, Director Lan criticized several incorrect ideas that hindered the development of the movement. This time, Liang Naitong personally saw the state's policy towards corrupt elements, and he was determined to confess again. But after the meeting, Wang Luyi came again: "If you talk, I'll say that you were the one who won me over first, and you spent all the embezzled money." He also said: "You talk, sending me away to be imprisoned for a few years is no big deal. Someday, when the Communist Party's new society changes, and other countries (referring to the United States) come, I'll come out and we'll meet again!" Some unscrupulous merchants found Liang at night and spoke to him in a dark and deserted alley, meaning: if you don't listen, we'll kill you here. Liang saw through this meaning and had to say, "I won't talk, I won't talk."

    At this time, Liang's ideological struggle was the most intense. With something on his mind, he found everything unpleasant. Lying on the kang at home, he sighed repeatedly, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. When his wife asked, he would scold her. When the children called him, he would beat them. His wife was a member of the residential reading group, very progressive. Seeing that Liang's mood was a little better, she asked Liang: "What is the matter with you? Have you embezzled anything?" Liang initially denied it. His wife said: "We saw in the newspaper that the government is calling on anyone who has embezzled to confess sincerely, and the government will definitely reduce their punishment." Liang then told her about their collective embezzlement. She said: "If you confess, the government will definitely be lenient with you." Liang said: "They (other corrupt elements) won't let me talk." She said: "Let's go talk together." Liang said: "They won't talk, and I can't talk either." She said:
    "If you don't talk, I'll go to the company and report you." Liang was afraid that his wife would report him, so he promised: "I will definitely confess sooner or later." Section Chief Cheng of the Industry and Commerce Bureau also talked to Liang: "You are from the working class, you must stand firm, you must play a model leading role." And gave Liang a copy of "On the Cultivation of Communist Party Members" and asked him to read it. Liang read it for a while, and when the ideological struggle became intense, he put it down. Sometimes he wanted to confess, so he picked it up again and looked at it. The two days before Liang's confession were the most intense of the struggle, eating a bite and spitting it out, not eating for two days.

    After Liang confessed, he said: "Before I confessed, I was most afraid of holding meetings. Every time a meeting was held, I would find the last corner of the venue or a dark place to sit, and I would lower my hat and cover my face with a mask, only revealing my eyes, afraid of being seen. Coincidentally, Section Chief Cheng walked up to me once, looked at me carefully, and said: 'Ah! You're sitting here!' I thought: 'Section Chief Cheng probably knows about my affair, otherwise why would he look at me?' I felt uneasy. When the meeting talked about things that stimulated me, I would plug my ears and not listen. Sometimes when I saw that others couldn't see me, I would slip away before the meeting was over."

    Liang Naitong Finally Confesses
    The conferences held by the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the company all played a role for Liang Naitong. Especially the third conference held by the Industry and Commerce Bureau, where six people were dealt with. Liang Naitong personally saw that the state's policy towards corrupt elements was to do what it said, which was completely contrary to what the degenerates and unscrupulous merchants said. Therefore, it strengthened Liang Naitong's determination to confess. Liang Naitong recalled that he used to be a worker and lived a life of hunger and cold, worse than that of cattle and horses, in the old society. In the country led by the working class, he was in the position of the master and lived a happy life. Doing this was completely wrong. At the same time, he recalled what Section Chief Cheng had said: "You are from the working class, you must play a model leading role." How to lead? The only way out was to thoroughly confess his own problems and expose the problems of others.

    Liang's wife's help was also very important. Liang Naitong thought:
    "My wife exposed counter-revolutionaries in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and this time she helped me and asked me to confess. If I don't make progress, I won't catch up with my wife." Therefore, he made a final decision, and finally, on December 25, 1951, taking the opportunity of the company holding a conference, he confessed his own problems to the organization after the meeting; at the same time, he also exposed the problems of others; and made a typical report at a conference held by the Industry and Commerce Bureau on the evening of the 26th. At the meeting, the Director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, Lan, announced that Wang Luyi, the stubborn and incorrigible element who masterminded the corruption, refused to confess, and sabotaged the movement, would be sent to the court for handling; Liang Naitong was exempted from punishment. That night after the meeting, Liang Naitong thought for a whole night; the next morning he supplemented some of his own problems and also exposed many other people's problems. From then on, Liang Naitong put down the heavy burden he had been carrying for half a year, his illness was cured, he was able to sleep, he was able to eat, he didn't beat his children or scold his wife, and the family was harmonious. He also expressed to the company that he was determined to help the company thoroughly carry out the anti-corruption movement, work hard, actively make meritorious deeds, and keep an eye on the state's coal, not allowing corrupt elements to steal any more.

    梁乃桐战胜贪污分子和奸商的阻挠坦白检举了自己和别人的贪污事实
    王海舲
    梁乃桐（长春煤业建筑器材公司第二营业部的门卫），过去是工人；来到公司当门卫的初期，思想很纯洁，工作很积极，认真负责，对工作很满意。
    梁乃桐是怎样被贪污分子王路一拖下了水的
    在一九五一年的春天，公司第二营业部开货票的王路一（贪污的主谋，地主出身，在伪满时住过警察学校，当过警察所长）和付煤员白殿启及代销处的私商勾结，打算往外偷煤，可是就差门卫这一关还没通过。王就向梁乃桐发动进攻了。他第一次拉拢梁说：“没有钱化，不憋得难受吗？”梁说：“没钱又有啥办法！”王说：“往外拉煤。”但被梁拒绝了。第二次王对梁又说：“你看某某人春夏秋冬穿的多好，手表皮鞋嘎嘎的。看你穿的什么！往外拉点干不干？”梁仍然没答应。以后王见梁就说：“钱是好化的，你还能在煤建公司干一辈子？”天长日久，梁乃桐动摇了，被王拖下了水，和四家推销处勾结起来，往外拉了两次煤。王把分给梁的钱，暗中又偷去。梁火了想不干，但王对梁威胁说：“你不干，我把你的事情都‘兜露’（揭发）出来！”梁有亏心事，只好和他一起干下去。这样越陷越深，把国家的煤炭成十吨十吨地拉出了煤场，贱价卖给了私商。共计拉出六十三吨（两火车皮）煤，使国家损失人民币八百九十万元。
    贪污分子和奸商怎样破坏梁乃桐的坦白
    反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动开始时，梁对贪污是最可耻的行为有了初步认识，想坦白检举；但有顾虑，怕说出后被送法院。因此，“谈”“不谈”就在思想上斗争着，每天心里是忐忑不安。梁的这种心情被王看破后，王就布置其他贪污分子和奸商，动摇梁的坦白决心。尤其每当行政方面开大会动员时，不是贪污分子来拉拢梁，就是奸商来威胁梁，阻挠梁的坦白。
    第一次工商局召开大会时，申市长在大会上讲：“认真坦白的，减轻处分；检举别人不准报复，谁要报复加重处罚。”会后，梁就想坦白自己的问题。王看梁要坦白，会后就请梁下小馆，问梁：“你想怎样办？”梁：“谈呗！”王说：“申市长的报告千万别听，他是一贯欺骗人的，别上了当。”并说：“刀压在我脖子上我也不谈；只要你不谈，谁都不能谈。”因而，梁的坦白决心被动摇了。梁说：
    “我也不谈了。”王不相信，要梁起誓，梁说：“我如果谈了是你的儿子。”从此，王看见梁思想斗争激烈情绪不高时，就说：“怎么，你又想当我儿子啦？”拿这话来刺激梁，使他不敢坦白。
    第二次工商局召开大会时，工商局局长蓝勇成和加工科科长程崑在大会上检讨了自己的错误。梁乃桐心想：“他们老干部，都敢把自己问题谈出来，我的问题一定谈。”但会后王路一又找到梁说：“这回你又怎么打算？”梁说：“你看蓝局长和程科长的问题都谈了，咱们的问题为什么不谈呢？咱们一块去谈吧。”王说：“你谈出来一定把你送法院，顶少也得三、五年徒刑。”梁说：“人民政府有宽大政策。”王又说：“共产党是老一套，先给你们甜枣吃，然后扒你的皮。”接着奸商也来找梁乃桐，其他贪污分子也来找梁乃桐。有的奸商说：“你千万不要谈，一谈连累不少人，与你有什么好处？”其中有一个奸商李绍贤，是刚被政府宽大而释放出来的反革命分子，以软硬齐下的办法破坏梁的坦白：“我刚被政府宽大出来，你千万不能谈，我给你叩一个头。”说了这话后，看梁不睬他，又说：“我干过反革命你是知道的（梁是镇压反革命时期的积极分子），如果你谈出咱们的事，我就咬你一口，说你与我在一起干过反革命。”和梁一起集体贪污的傅洪英（女）也写信给梁约会到电影院里，布置不让梁坦白。这样，梁又没敢谈。
    第三次工商局召开大会时，处理了六个人，把拒不坦白并联合奸商破坏运动的关凤地、王安宇、吴廷臣三个人送法院法办，把不忠诚老实坦白自己错误的党员孙捷，开除党籍，撤职查办；把自己坦白并检举别人的刘宜芝、郑礼信免除处罚，在会上并由蓝局长把阻碍运动发展的几种不正确的思想加以批判。梁乃桐这回亲眼看到国家对贪污分子的政策，就又决心要坦白。但会后王路一又找来了：“你要谈，我就说你先拉拢我的，贪污的钱都叫你化了。”又说：“你谈吧，把我抓去顶多住上几年巴篱子，将来共产党的新社会一变，别的国家（指美国）来了我出来咱们再见！”有的奸商在夜里把梁找到黑暗无人行走的夹道里去讲，意思即是：如果你不听，就把你整死在这里。梁看破这种意思，只好说：“我不谈，不谈。”
    这个时候是梁思想斗争最激烈的时候，心中有事看见什么都不顺眼，回家躺在炕上长嘘短叹，翻来覆去，睡不着，老婆问就骂老婆，孩子叫就打孩子。他老婆是居民读报组组员，很进步，看梁的情绪好点时，就问梁：“你到底有什么问题？是不是贪污了？”梁最初不承认。老婆说：“我们从报纸上看到政府号召，谁贪污了，能忠诚坦白，政府一定减轻处分。”梁才把他们集体贪污事告诉了她。她说：“你坦白了，政府一定会宽大你的。”梁说：“他们
    （其他贪污分子）不让我谈。”她说：“你们一起去谈吧。”梁说：“他们不谈，我也不能谈。”她说：
    “你不谈，我就去公司告你们。”梁怕老婆告他，就答应说：“我早晚一定坦白。”工商局程科长也找梁谈：“你是工人阶级，要站稳立场，要起模范带头作用。”并给梁一本“论共产党员的修养”要他看。梁看一会，思想斗争厉害了就丢下；有时想坦白，就又拿起来看看。梁坦白前两天，斗争最激烈，吃一口吐一口，两天没吃下去饭。
    梁坦白后说：“我没坦白前，最怕开大会，每开大会时都找会场的最后角上或暗的地方坐，还把帽子往下一垂，口罩往上一罩，光露两个眼，怕人看到自己。可巧有一次程科长走到我的跟前，好好看了看我说：‘啊！是你坐在这里！’我心想：‘程科长大概知道了我的事情，不然他为什么看我呢？’心里就不安起来。会议讲到刺激我的地方，就塞住耳朵不听。有时候看到别人看不见，会没开完就先溜了。”
    梁乃桐终于坦白了
    工商局和公司召开的大会，对梁乃桐来说，都起过作用。尤其是工商局召开的第三次大会，处理了六个人，梁乃桐亲眼看到了国家对贪污分子的政策，是说到那里就做到那里，和蜕化分子、奸商所说的完全相反，因此，坚定了梁乃桐坦白的决心。梁乃桐回想起自己过去是工人，在旧社会里过着饥寒交迫牛马不如的痛苦生活，而在工人阶级领导的国家里，自己处在主人翁的地位，过着美满幸福的生活，做出这事是完全错误的。同时，他回忆起程科长所说的话：“你是工人阶级，要起模范带头作用。”怎样带头？只有彻底交代自己的问题，揭发其他人的问题，才是唯一的出路。
    梁的妻子对他的帮助也是很大的。梁乃桐想：
    “我老婆在镇压反革命运动中检举过反革命分子，这次又帮助我要我坦白，我再不进步，赶不上老婆了。”因此，就下定最后决心，终于在一九五一年十二月二十五日，趁公司召开大会的机会，在会后就向组织交代了自己的问题；同时，也检举了其他人的问题；并在二十六日晚间在工商局召开的大会上作了典型报告。会上，由工商局蓝局长宣布把贪污主谋拒不坦白并破坏运动的顽固不化分子王路一送法院法办；梁乃桐免予处罚。会后当晚，梁乃桐想了一宿；第二天早晨又补充了自己的一些问题，同时又检举了许多其他人的问题。从此，梁乃桐把半年来背在身上的千斤包袱放下来了，病也好了，亦能睡着觉了，也能吃下饭了；不打孩子，也不骂老婆，家庭和睦了。他并向公司表示：今后决心帮助公司把反贪污运动搞彻底，努力工作，积极立功，把国家的煤炭看住，不让贪污分子再盗去一点。
