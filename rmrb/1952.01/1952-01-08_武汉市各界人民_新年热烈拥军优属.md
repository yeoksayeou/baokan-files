Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, January 3rd: People from all walks of life in Wuhan are widely launching a New Year movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers. All the workers of the Jiang'an Locomotive Depot of the Beijing-Hankou Railway wrote a letter to the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers to extend New Year greetings and report to them the production achievement of the entire section of train attendants exceeding the axle load by more than 20,000 tons in the past month. They used this achievement as a New Year gift to the Volunteers. All the employees of the second wholesale department of the Municipal Department Store sent the Volunteers many New Year's greeting letters, toothbrushes, towels, and diaries. The elementary school students of Municipal No. 23 Elementary School wrote 560 letters to the Volunteer uncles to extend New Year greetings. Housewife Yang Yaoqing used the pocket money she had saved for half a year to buy cloth and made ten pairs of shoes for the Volunteers. When she sent the shoes to the shoemaker to put on the soles, the shoemaker He Yuangen dropped his other work when he heard that they were for the Volunteers, and put on the soles overnight, and donated the labor cost of 40,000 yuan to the Volunteers. People from all walks of life have donated money and gifts to comfort the local garrison, the wounded and sick soldiers, and the families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary servicemen, and revolutionary workers. The 20 porters of the second team of the ninth detachment of the Municipal Transportation Company donated 200,000 yuan, which they had prepared for the New Year, as expenses for supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers. The Hankou Xinmin Beef Wholesale Joint Venture donated all 5 million yuan of entertainment expenses originally intended to celebrate the opening of the store as condolence money.
