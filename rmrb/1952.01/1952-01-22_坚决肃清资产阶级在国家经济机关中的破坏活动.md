    Resolutely Purge the Sabotage Activities of the Bourgeoisie in State Economic Organs
    Our country's economic work departments are the departments that have the most contact with the bourgeoisie, and also an important target of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks. In the past three years, some industrial and commercial capitalists have engaged in market transactions, accepted processing orders, and construction projects, adopting various despicable fraudulent means such as cutting corners, reducing quality, raising prices, and adulterating goods to deceive state-owned enterprises and economic administrative departments, and obtain exorbitant profits. In foreign trade, some importers and exporters have colluded with foreign capitalists to fabricate market information, create false scams, smuggle and evade taxes, betray the interests of the state and the people, and steal the wealth of the state and the people. In order to achieve these despicable goals, they have not hesitated to use various illegal means such as treating guests, giving gifts, providing loans, offering kickbacks, bribery, shareholding, and profit-sharing, setting up many traps to entice and corrupt cadres of state economic departments, making these cadres tools for them to use, and informants in state organs and state-owned enterprises, stealing secrets for them, providing information, using the name of state organs to help them engage in illegal smuggling, and colluding with them in transactions between state-owned enterprises and private industrial and commercial enterprises. Some industrial and commercial capitalists have even sent their own agents to infiltrate state economic administrative departments and state-owned enterprises, occupying key positions and seizing leadership, attempting to transform a portion of state-owned enterprises into tools serving the interests of the bourgeoisie. This is the most vicious way the bourgeoisie is carrying out sabotage activities in the state-owned economic organs of the People's Republic of China.
    In the past three years, economic administrative departments and state-owned enterprises at all levels have absorbed a large number of workers from society, a large part of whom were old merchants, former employees, personnel from the bureaucratic organs of the Kuomintang reactionaries, employees of foreign firms serving imperialism, old intellectuals, and technical cadres who had not yet been reformed. They brought many old ideas and styles to state economic administrative departments and state-owned enterprises, bringing the corrupt and degenerate bourgeois ideology of corruption, waste, extravagance, and using public office for private gain, as well as the bourgeois commercial knowledge and commercial experience of speculation and exploitation of the masses. Many of them have numerous social connections with the bourgeoisie, enabling the bourgeoisie to find ways to attack economic administrative organs and state-owned enterprises. In economic administrative departments at all levels, state-owned trading enterprises, and state-owned industries, many leading comrades have not been sufficiently vigilant against the attacks of the bourgeoisie. Some people are satisfied with some of the achievements made in restoring and developing production, managing the market, stabilizing prices, and conducting economic struggles against capitalist countries in the past three years, and are satisfied with the fact that the operation and management of state-owned enterprises has been improved to some extent, thus ignoring the seriousness of the erosion of state economic organs by bourgeois ideology from both the outside and the inside. Some people's own thinking has been eroded by the bourgeoisie, their lives are becoming increasingly extravagant, they pay attention to treating guests, giving gifts, and currying favor, learning from the corrupt and degenerate style of the bourgeoisie. Among them, a few leading cadres and Communist Party members have been hit by sugar-coated bullets, colluding with private merchants, engaging in embezzlement and fraud, and becoming moths that steal the property of the state and the people. The reason why there are such serious phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in economic organs at all levels, and the reason why these phenomena have not been eliminated for a long time but have instead developed, is because many leading cadres in these departments are being eroded by bourgeois ideology and are in a state of ideological paralysis.
    Today, the exposure in this newspaper of the crimes of the major embezzler Xue Kunshan, who stole state secrets and directed his own business to steal state assets, is clear evidence of the bourgeoisie engaging in sabotage activities within state-owned enterprises. Xue Kunshan was originally an ordinary fur merchant with only 200 bolts of cloth as capital. In 1945, he was introduced to cooperate with a state-owned trading company in a fur warehouse. During the Liberation War, this fur warehouse achieved some development, and after the liberation of Zhangjiakou, he handed over the funds and profits to the People's Government, thus gaining the blind trust of the leading comrades of the trade department and infiltrating the state-owned trading enterprise, seizing the important position of deputy director of the business department of the fur company. He was ostensibly a cadre of a state-owned trading enterprise, but in reality, he was running his own business, using his position to leak state secrets, engage in speculation and profiteering, fluctuate prices, and hoard goods. According to preliminary statistics, he stole more than 2 billion yuan in state and people's assets in three years. The lesson of the Xue Kunshan case tells us how insidious and vicious the bourgeoisie's attack on state-owned enterprises is, and how serious the loss of people's property is; it also tells us how serious damage it will cause to the state and the people if leading cadres lack vigilance against the bourgeoisie's attack in their thinking and are in a state of ideological paralysis.
    At present, in the state-owned trade sector and other state-owned enterprises, there are many bourgeois corrupt and destructive elements like Xue Kunshan. Some of them have already been discovered, and some may not have been discovered yet. As for those who have been enticed by illegal capitalists and sold out the interests of the state and the people, the number is even greater. The lesson of the Xue Kunshan case tells us that all leading cadres who have been eroded by bourgeois ideology and lack vigilance against the bourgeoisie's attack must wake up, clearly recognize the current situation of the bourgeoisie attacking state economic organs, raise vigilance, mobilize the masses, launch a resolute counter-attack against the bourgeoisie's rampant attack, and resolutely purge the bourgeoisie's destructive activities in state economic organs.
    All state-owned enterprises are the public property of all the people of our country and a powerful weapon to ensure that our country victoriously embarks on the road of industrialization. It is necessary to maintain its purity and health and promote its combat power by all necessary means, and it must never be allowed to be eroded by the bourgeoisie. Therefore, all cases of corruption, large and small, must be fully exposed and dealt with according to the nature and severity of their crimes and the extent of the confession and repentance of the corrupt elements. All major corrupt elements with heinous crimes must be severely punished; all illegal bourgeois elements who are hidden inside state economic organs and engaged in destructive activities must be resolutely eliminated. We should try to prevent illegal industrialists and businessmen from infiltrating state economic organs to carry out destructive activities, and we should try to eliminate the possibility of the bourgeoisie continuing to erode state economic organs, so as to protect the public property of the people from infringement and ensure the victorious advance of the state's construction cause. In state economic organs led by the working class, all corrupt and decadent bourgeois ideas must be severely criticized and not allowed to spread; all speculative and exploitative methods of operation must be resolutely abandoned and not adopted. Only in this way can the purity of the state economic organs be maintained, can the relationship between the state economic organs and the broad masses of the people be improved, and can our state economic organs truly become a strong force for economic construction led by the working class.

    坚决肃清资产阶级在国家经济机关中的破坏活动
    我们国家的经济工作部门是和资产阶级接触最多的部门，也是资产阶级猖狂进攻的一个重要对象。近三年来，有些工商业资本家在从事市场交易、接受加工定货和基本建设中，采取了偷工减料、降低品质、抬高价格、掺水掺杂等各种卑鄙欺诈的手段，来欺骗国营企业和经济行政部门，获取暴利；在对外贸易中，有些进出口商勾结了外国资本家伪造商情、虚设骗局、走私漏税、背叛国家和人民的利益，窃取国家和人民的财富。他们为了达到这种卑鄙的目的，便不惜采用请客、送礼、借款、回扣、行贿、入股、分红等各种违法的手段，设置了许多圈套，来勾引和腐蚀国家经济部门的干部，使这些干部成为他们利用的工具，成为他们在国家机关与国营企业中的内线，替他们窃取机密，供给情报，利用国家机关的名义，帮助他们违法走私，并在国营企业和私人工商业的交易上，跟他们狼狈为奸。有些工商业资本家甚至派遣自己的代理人，打入国家经济行政部门和国营企业中，盘据要津，窃取领导，企图使某一部分的国营企业，变质成为替资产阶级利益服务的工具。这就是资产阶级在中华人民共和国的国营经济机关中进行破坏活动的最狠毒的方式。
    三年来，各级经济行政部门和国营企业，从社会上吸收了大批工作人员，其中很大一部分是尚未经过改造的旧商人、旧职员、国民党反动派官僚机关的工作人员、替帝国主义服务的洋行职员、旧知识分子和技术干部。他们给国家经济行政部门和国营企业带来了许多旧思想和旧作风，带来了贪污、腐化、铺张浪费、假公济私的资产阶级腐化堕落思想和投机取巧、剥削群众的资产阶级的商业知识和商业经验。他们中间有许多人和资产阶级发生着千丝万缕的社会联系，使资产阶级能够找到门路，向经济行政机关和国营企业进攻。在各级经济行政部门，国营贸易企业和国营工业中，由于许多领导同志没有充分警惕资产阶级的进攻，有些人满足于三年来在恢复与发展生产、管理市场、稳定物价以及对资本主义国家进行经济斗争中所取得的一些成就，满足于国营企业的经营管理工作已经获得了一些改进，因而忽视了资产阶级思想从外部和内部对于国家经济机关侵蚀的严重性。有些人自己的思想受到了资产阶级的侵蚀，生活日趋铺张，讲究请客、送礼、拉拢，向资产阶级的腐化堕落的作风学习，其中有少数领导干部和共产党员，已经被糖衣炮弹所打中，勾结私商，营私舞弊，成为盗窃国家和人民财产的蟊贼。各级经济机关之所以存在这样严重的贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象，这些现象之所以长期未被消除，反而日渐发展，就是因为这些部门的许多领导干部，受着资产阶级思想的侵蚀，思想上陷于麻痹状态的缘故。
    今天本报发表的大贪污犯薛崑山窃取国家机密，指挥他自己的商号，盗窃国家资财的罪行，就是资产阶级钻在国营企业里进行破坏活动的明证。薛崑山本来是一个只有二百匹布资金的普通皮毛商人，一九四五年经人介绍与国营贸易公司合营皮毛栈，在解放战争期间，由于这个皮毛栈获得了一些发展，并于张家口解放后将资金与利润交给人民政府，因此就取得了贸易部门的领导同志的盲目信任，钻进了国营贸易企业，窃取了皮毛公司业务处副处长的重要职位。他在表面上是国营贸易企业的干部，实际上在经营他自己的企业，利用职权，泄露国家机密，投机倒把，波动物价，囤积居奇。据初步统计三年中他窃取了国家与人民的资财达二十余亿元。薛崑山案件的教训告诉了我们，资产阶级对于国营企业的进攻是何等阴险，何等毒辣，造成人民财产的损失是何等严重；同时也告诉了我们，领导干部在思想上对资产阶级的进攻缺少警惕，思想上呈现麻痹状态，对于国家和人民会造成何等重大的损害。
    目前在国营贸易部门中和其他国营企业中，像薛崑山这样的资产阶级贪污破坏分子，还有许多。其中有些已经开始被发现，有些可能还没有被发现。至于被不法的资本家勾引利诱而出卖国家与人民利益的人，则为数更多。薛崑山案件的教训告诉了我们：一切受到了资产阶级思想的侵蚀，对于资产阶级的进攻缺少警惕性的领导干部，必须猛醒过来，清楚地认识目前资产阶级向国家经济机关进攻的情况，提高警觉，发动群众，对于资产阶级的猖狂进攻，举行一个坚决的反攻，坚决肃清资产阶级在国家经济机关中的破坏活动。
    一切国营企业是我国全体人民的公共财产，是保障我们的国家胜利地走上工业化建设道路的有力武器，必须用一切必要的方法，来保持它的纯洁和健康，发扬它的战斗力量，决不能容许资产阶级对它的侵蚀。因此，一切大小的贪污案件，必须充分揭发，按照其罪恶性质轻重及贪污分子坦白悔过的程度，分别处理。对于一切罪大恶极的大贪污犯，必须予以严厉惩办；对于一切潜藏在国家经济机关内部进行破坏活动的资产阶级不法分子，必须坚决加以清除。我们应该设法防止不法的工商业者混入国家经济机关中来进行破坏活动，应该设法消除资产阶级继续对于国家经济机关侵蚀的可能性，以保护人民的公共财产不受侵犯，保障国家建设事业的胜利前进。在以工人阶级为领导的国家经济机关内，一切资产阶级的腐化堕落思想，都必须受到严厉的批判，不能听任其传播；一切投机取巧，剥削群众的经营方法，都必须坚决加以摒弃，不得采用。只有这样，才能保持国家经济机关的纯洁性，才能改善国家经济机关和广大人民群众的关系，使我们的国家经济机关真正成为以工人阶级为领导的进行经济建设的坚强力量。
