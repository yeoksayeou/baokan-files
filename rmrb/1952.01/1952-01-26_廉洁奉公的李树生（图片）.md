    7. When Li Shusheng saw him, he recognized the owner of the Wenrumu Timber Company. An idea immediately struck him, and he accepted the money. The owner was very happy and swaggered out the door.
    8. Early the next morning, Li Shusheng handed over the money given by the unscrupulous merchant, untouched, to the company leaders, and reported the timber company owner's series of shameless bribery attempts.
    9. Two days later, the Xi'an Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau summoned the owner of Wenrumu Timber Company and investigated his consistent illegal activities of producing fakes, bribery, speculation, and fraud. The owner confessed that his attempt to bribe Li Shusheng was to substitute half of "Baoji Pine" for "Hunan Pine" during delivery. At that time, "Baoji Pine" planks were 100,000 yuan cheaper per zhang than "Hunan Pine" planks. Li Shusheng's refusal to accept the bribe saved the state from a loss of 5.85 million yuan.
    10. From then on, Li Shusheng became even more vigilant and responsible in handling the company's procurement work, thwarting many unscrupulous merchants who tried to entice him with benefits. In 1951, the timber he was responsible for purchasing was 143.3 million yuan cheaper than the market price. Because of his integrity and public service and his achievements in saving huge expenses for the country, he was selected as a special-class labor model within the company and received a commendation from the Xi'an Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau.

    七、李树生一看，这人正是温如木行的老板。他马上心生一计，把钱收下。老板心里很高兴，就摇头幌脑地走出了大门。
    八、次日一清早，李树生就把奸商送来的这笔钱，原封不动地交给公司领导人，并报告了木行老板一连串的无耻行贿行为。
    九、过了两天，西安市人民政府工商局把温如木行的老板找去，查明了温如木行一贯造假、行贿、投机、诈骗的违法罪行。老板供认：他企图贿赂李树生，就是想在交货时用一半“宝鸡松”顶替“湖南松”。当时“宝鸡松”木板比“湖南松”木板每丈要贱十万元。李树生没有受贿，就使国家免受五百八十五万元的损失。
    十、李树生从此更加提高警惕，认真负责地对待公司的采购工作，使许多想利诱他的奸商都碰了钉子。一九五一年经他负责买回的木料，较市价共便宜一亿四千三百多万元。由于他的廉洁奉公的作风和为国家节省巨大开支的成绩，他在公司内被选为特等劳动模范，并受到西安市工商局的通报表扬。（完）
