The Story of a Handkerchief and Others
Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Representative Gao Shuji

    A Small Handkerchief

    A snow-white little handkerchief, printed with bright red "Heroically Kill the Enemy, Defend the Homeland," was passed around among the eight soldiers of a squad in a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, their eyes fixed on it. Everyone wanted it, but no one said it out loud. Squad leader Yang Jinting examined the handkerchief for a long time, understanding the soldiers' feelings. He smiled and asked, "Comrades, everyone wants it, right?" Then he explained, "We don't want it because it's pretty, but because we want the hearts of the people of the motherland, the millions of hearts sent from thousands of miles away." So he suggested that, in order not to disappoint the people of the motherland, everyone should practice their skills and kill more enemies. Everyone would compete in practicing with the new weapons, and "whoever masters them first will get the little handkerchief sent by the people of the motherland." The soldiers all applauded and agreed, and a "compete for the handkerchief" movement began in the ninth squad.

    Soldier Huang Ronghua had just arrived in the squad and didn't know how to use any of the new weapons. He didn't take a nap at noon and worked hard to learn how to disassemble and aim. At first, he was embarrassed to ask others when he didn't understand something. Later, he thought, how can I live up to the people of the motherland with this kind of learning attitude? So he plucked up his courage to ask others for help, and he no longer blushed when he asked too many questions. In a few days, he learned how to use the new machine gun, learned hand grenade demolition, and learned small artillery. His eyes were bloodshot. Huang Xiankun was originally a cook, and during the "compete for the handkerchief" he often thought: "I didn't get enough of a chance in the Fifth Campaign and the blocking battles, mainly because I wasn't proficient in using weapons. This time I'm determined to practice my skills and respond to the people of the motherland." His fingers were worn out, but he endured the pain and practiced, and later he caught up with Comrade Huang Ronghua. Everyone in the squad didn't fall behind, and in a short period of time, they all became proficient in weapons. For example, now the speed of assembling and disassembling a machine gun with their eyes closed is twice as fast as before with their eyes open. In the end, they made a summary and gave the little handkerchief carrying the hearts of the people of the motherland to Huang Ronghua, the learning model of the whole squad.

    Song of the Cotton Clothes

    In September, the cotton clothes arrived at the front. Fu Changgen, a soldier of the ninth company, touched the cotton clothes over and over again and said, "In my whole life, I have never felt so happy wearing cotton clothes. Look, it's just like parents loving their children, thinking of every needle and every thread." Another soldier snatched it and said, "In the past, at home, wearing cotton clothes was 'new for three years, old for three years, patched up for another three years.' We must try to wear these clothes for three years. When wearing these clothes, we must not only protect the dear parents and sisters of the motherland, but also save for the motherland." One soldier had blisters all over his hands from digging fortifications. He said, "Seeing the new cotton clothes, I don't feel the pain anymore." In order to take care of the cotton clothes, the soldiers wrote a rhythmic poem: I am a set of new cotton clothes, My journey is not easy. The peasant brothers care about me, They nurtured me from a young age; Diligently weeding, irrigating in drought, Exposed to wind and sun, working hard. Half a year of hard work to grow cotton, And then send me to the factory. Textile workers spin me, And specially modified the loom for me. Wove me into good fine cloth of fourteen pounds, And dyed me with good colors on the electric motor. From then on, a new life began, Cotton turned into new cotton clothes. The clothing factory took me over, Sewing and cutting day and night without rest. Production to support the front lines is in high spirits, Carefully and conscientiously making cotton clothes. Sewn sturdy and good-looking, Not short, not thin, nor fat. Hearing that the front needs them urgently, Quickly send me here. Taking the train, taking the car, Crossing mountains and valleys for thousands of miles. Although I haven't taken a single step, The good brothers on the transportation line are exhausted. He works hard and worries about me: Afraid of damaging, afraid of losing, And afraid of enemy planes attacking. He guards me day and night, Fearing that I won't be able to see you. Good comrades, let me tell you: I am exchanged for the hard work and sweat of the people of the motherland. I have told you about my origin, And now I will tell you about my mission: Resisting America and aiding Korea is the general purpose, The people of the motherland love you. Without me, you can hardly sleep in the middle of the night, Without me, you cannot practice martial arts in the cold weather; With me, you are not afraid of cold weather, wind, and snow, With me, you have more strength to kill the enemy in cold weather. You must care about me more, Keep me in your mind, To love me is to love the motherland, To love me is to love the people, To love me is to love parents, To love me is to love victory, There is also the first thing to love me, Mutual assistance, unity, and kill more enemies.

    Books and Newspapers to the Front

    A batch of pamphlets was transported to a certain unit on the front, and a battlefront library was established. Wu Zhikui, a soldier of the first company, went to the library with everyone. He touched one of the books: "Oh, this may have been donated by the workers to us!" He touched another one: "This may have been donated by the elementary school students!" Comic strips depicting heroic stories were the most popular among the soldiers. Wu Zhikui borrowed a "Story of the Long March," and for three consecutive days, he didn't take a nap, but took it to the woods to read. After reading it, he ran to the political instructor and asked him to write a letter to the people of the motherland for him. He said, "Tell the people of the motherland that I have read these heroic stories and I also want to be a hero." After reading "The Five Heroes of Langya Mountain," the comrades of the Second Group of the First Company Youth League held a group meeting to discuss how to learn from the heroic spirit of the five heroes. When the comic strip "Cui Jianguo's Assault Platoon" arrived at the company where Cui Jianguo was, the comrades were extremely happy. Wang Laicheng, who had personally stabbed American devils to death, and Wei Ming, who had split two American soldiers to death with a shovel, read the book over and over again. They said, "Let's fight another beautiful battle so that our names will be spread all over the country!" After reading the pictures about his company, the new soldier Zhang Yinqing silently worked hard to practice his skills whenever he had free time. When he learned how to use seven kinds of weapons, especially the use of hand grenade blasting cylinders, he ran to the platoon leader and said, "Now we can write a letter to the people of the motherland who sent us the books. Just say: We have all mastered the technology, we want to fight tanks, and we want to eliminate more enemies to respond to the people of the motherland."

    Letters of Condolence

    Thousands of letters of condolence flew to the Korean battlefield like snowflakes. The soldiers read them over and over again. Some treasured them in their satchels. A soldier named Lu of the Fourth Company of a certain unit received a letter of condolence from a female worker in Shanghai. He heard that the women had stayed up all night to support the front lines. Therefore, he stepped up his training, and when others rested at night, he always went to the woods to practice the movements up and down several times before going back. When others found out and asked him, he took out the letter and read it to everyone. He said, "People have stayed up all night for us, and they say we are the most lovable people. How can we be lovable? Having the skills and killing the enemy is the most lovable." The students of Beijing Municipal Fourth Middle School wrote to the one-armed blasting hero Chai Xueji, requesting that "uncles wipe out all the American devils in Korea, defend world peace, defend the people of the motherland, and defend our ability to study well." The letter said: "Uncles, protect me so that I can learn knowledge well and serve the people when I grow up." Although Chai Xueji was old and weak due to his arm being broken, his fighting will was even stronger. He said to the people, "Hearing the voice of the next generation, I hate the American imperialism that destroys human happiness even more." He wrote back to the children and said: "I will always defend the motherland, defend the dear children, and fight to the end for the happiness of the next generation!"

    一块手帕的故事及其他
    中国人民志愿军归国代表　高树基
    一块小手帕
    一块雪白的小手帕，印着鲜红夺目的“英勇杀敌，保家卫国”几个字，在志愿军某部一班八个战士的手里传来传去，大家的眼睛盯着他。都想要，可是都没有说出口。班长杨金停拿着手帕端详了很久，他猜透了战士们的心情。他笑着问：“同志们，都想要。是不是？”接着他解释：“我们不是为了它漂亮想要，而是为了想要祖国人民的心，想要千里外送来的千百万人民的心。”于是他提议，为了不辜负祖国人民的心，大家要练好本领，多杀敌人。大家来比赛比赛练习使用新武器，“谁先练会了，就把祖国人民送来的小手帕给谁。”战士们都鼓掌赞成，一个“比武夺帕”的运动在九班开始了。
    战士黄荣华刚到班上，新武器一样也不会用，他就不睡午觉，抓紧学拆卸，学瞄准。开始时，他有不懂的地方，不好意思问别人。后来他想，我这样的学习态度，怎样能对得起祖国人民。于是他鼓起勇气向别人请教，问的多了，脸也不红了。不几天，他就学会了使用新式机枪，学会了手雷爆破，又学会了小炮。他的眼睛都熬红了。黄贤坤原来是炊事员，“比武夺帕”时，经常想：“我在五次战役和阻击战中都没吃上劲，主要是使用武器不熟练。这次下决心练好本领，回答祖国人民。”他的手指磨破了，还是忍住痛苦练，后来也赶上了黄荣华同志。全班人人不落后，短短的时间内，都熟练了武器。比如，现在闭眼睛拆装机枪的速度，比以前睁着眼做还要快一倍。最后他们作了总结，这块带着祖国人民心意的小手帕，送给了全班的学习模范黄荣华。
    棉衣歌
    九月间，棉衣到了前线。九连战士傅长根拿着棉衣摸了又摸说：“一辈子我没有因穿棉衣感到这样愉快过。你看，真像爹娘爱孩子一样，一个针一条线都想到了。”另一个战士抢过来说：“过去在家穿棉衣是新三年，旧三年，缝缝补补又三年，咱们这衣服也要想法穿三年。穿着这衣服时，不但要保卫祖国亲爱的爹娘姐妹们，还要给祖国节约。”有一个战士在挖工事中手上打满手泡，他说：“看到新棉衣，就不知道疼了。”为了爱护棉衣，战士们编了一首快板诗：我是一套新棉衣，我的来路不容易。农民兄弟关心我，把我从小培养起；勤除草，旱浇水，风吹日晒多卖力。半年辛苦种棉花，又把我送到了工厂里。纺织工人把我纺，为了我又专门改装了织布机。织成了十四磅的好细布，电机上把我染上了好颜色。从此开始了新生活，棉花变成了新棉衣。被服厂把我接过去，日夜缝剪不休息。生产支前情绪高，小心认真作棉衣。缝的结实样子好，不短不瘦又不肥。听说前方需要紧，赶快把我送这里。坐火车，坐汽车，翻山越岭几千里。我虽没走一步路，可累坏了运输线上的好兄弟。他为我辛苦又耽心：怕弄坏，怕弄丢，又怕敌机来袭击。他黑夜白天保卫我，怕我不能见到你。好同志，我告诉你：我是祖国人民的辛苦血汗换来的。家乡来历说了一遍，再把我的任务告诉你：抗美援朝是总目的，祖国人民爱护你。没有我，你半夜三更难睡觉，没有我，你天冷不能练武艺；有了我，不怕天冷风雪大，有了我，冷天杀敌添气力。你要对我多关心，把我记在脑子里，爱我就是爱祖国，爱我就是爱人民，爱我就是爱爹娘，爱我就是爱胜利，爱我还有头一宗，互助团结多杀敌。
    书报到前方
    一批小册子运到了前线某部，战地图书馆成立起来了。一连战士吴志奎和大家一齐到图书馆去，他把这本书摸一摸：“哟，这可能是工人捐给咱的！”又摸一摸另一本：“这可能是小学生捐的！”描写英雄故事的连环画，最受战士们欢迎。吴志奎借了一本“长征故事”，一连三天没睡午觉，拿到树林里去读，看完后，他又跑到指导员那里，请求指导员替他给祖国人民写一封信。他说：“告诉祖国人民，我看了这些英雄故事，我也要当英雄。”一连青年团二组的同志们看了“狼牙山五壮士”后，开了一次小组会，讨论怎样学习五壮士的英勇精神。“崔建国尖刀排”的连环画，到了崔建国所在连时，同志们高兴极了。曾经亲手刺死美国鬼子的王来成，用铁锹劈死两个美国兵的魏明，把这本书看了一遍又一遍。他们说：“再打一个漂亮仗，让咱的名字全国都传到！”新战士张银清看了关于自己连的图画后，每天一有空闲时间就不声不响地去苦练技术，当他学会了使用七种武器，特别是学会了手雷爆破筒用法后，跑到排长那里说：“现在可以写信给咱送书来的祖国人民了。就说：咱们都掌握了技术，要打坦克，要消灭更多的敌人来回答祖国人民。”
    慰问信
    千万封慰问信，像雪片一样飞向朝鲜战场。战士们把它看了一遍又一遍。有的把它珍贵地装进挂包里。某部四连一位姓卢的战士，接到上海一个女工的慰问信。她听到了妇女们为了支援前线，把眼都熬红了。于是，他就加紧练武，晚上别人休息了，他总要到树林里爬上爬下地练习几遍动作才回去。别人发现后问他时，他便把信拿出来念给大家听。他说：“人家为了咱眼都熬红了，还说咱是最可爱的人。怎样才可爱呢？有了本事，杀了敌人，才是最可爱。”北京市立第四中学的学生给独臂爆破英雄柴学久写信，要求“叔叔们把美国鬼子全部消灭在朝鲜，保卫住世界和平，保卫住祖国人民，保卫我们能好好念书。”信里说：“叔叔们，保卫我学好了知识，长大了为人民服务。”柴学久虽然年纪大，又因断臂身体很瘦弱，可是他的斗争意志更加旺盛。他对人们说：“听到了下一代的声音，我更加痛恨摧残人类幸福的美帝国主义。”他给小朋友们回信说：“我要永远保卫祖国，保卫亲爱的孩子们，为后一代的幸福战斗到底！”
