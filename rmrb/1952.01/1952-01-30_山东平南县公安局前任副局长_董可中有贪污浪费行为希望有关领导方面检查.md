To the Editor:

We want to expose the illegal activities of Dong Kezhong, the former Deputy Director of the Pingnan County Public Security Bureau in Shandong Province, including corruption and waste.

Dong Kezhong is currently studying in the third class of the Central Political and Legal Cadre School. During his tenure as Deputy Director of the Pingnan County Public Security Bureau, Dong Kezhong embezzled many properties. Once, under the pretext of "getting dentures," he privately misappropriated 700,000 yuan of public funds. Dong Kezhong once accepted two cans of milk as bribes from a prisoner and also privately misappropriated a bakelite pipe and a piece of opium from prisoners. In order to satisfy his personal desires, Dong Kezhong used more than 1 million yuan of public funds to build a fish pond in August 1951. The comrades' dormitories were in poor condition, and their clothes and bedding were often damp, but Dong Kezhong did not care. Dong Kezhong also arbitrarily wasted public dry cell batteries. He used 45-watt dry cell batteries for lighting while "working" and riding a bicycle, consuming a total of six batteries, worth 720,000 yuan. He also privately gave away more than 60 pairs of dry cell batteries for flashlights, worth 300,000 yuan. Dong Kezhong frequently used guns to shoot birds for food, disregarding the waste of ammunition and manpower. Dong Kezhong's bureaucratic style was also very serious. He caused long-term disunity among the comrades in the bureau and also affected the unity between various agencies in Pingnan County. His communications comrade said: "Director Dong is transferred, I am liberated!" The head of the detention center said: "When I see him, I have to lower my head." Comrades rarely approached Dong Kezhong.

The above are all true facts. We hope that the relevant leadership will send someone to investigate and take appropriate action against Dong Kezhong.

    山东平南县公安局前任副局长
    董可中有贪污浪费行为希望有关领导方面检查
    编辑同志：我们要揭发山东省平南县公安局前任副局长董可中的贪污、浪费等不法行为。
    董可中现在中央政法干部学校第三班学习。董可中在平南县公安局副局长任内，先后贪污许多财物。一次，他藉口“镶牙”，又私自挪用公款七十万元。董可中曾经受犯人贿赂牛奶两筒，又私自挪用犯人的电木烟斗一只、鸦片烟一块。董可中为了满足他个人的欲望，在一九五一年八月，曾经动用公款一百多万元修鱼池一个。同志们的宿舍很坏，衣、被常受潮湿，董可中却不管。董可中还任意浪费公家的干电池。他曾经用四十五瓦特的干电池点灯“办公”、骑自行车等，共用去六块，合七十二万元；他又把手电筒用的干电池六十多对私自送人，这些电池值三十万元。董可中不顾枪弹、人力的浪费，经常拿枪打鸟吃。董可中的官僚主义作风也很严重。他造成局内同志们的长期不团结，并且影响了平南县各机关之间的团结。他的通讯员同志说：“董局长调走了，我可解放了！”押犯所长说：“我见了他，得把头低下。”同志们很少与董可中接近的。
    以上都是真情。我们希望有关领导方面派人来调查，并对董可中作适当处理。
