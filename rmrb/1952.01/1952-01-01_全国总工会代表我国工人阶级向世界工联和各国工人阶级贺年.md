To the Central Council of the Bulgarian General Trade Union:
On the joyous occasion of the New Year of 1952, I extend warm congratulations on behalf of the Chinese working class to the Bulgarian working class, and wish you greater victories in the struggle to complete the Five-Year Plan under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party. The great contributions made by the Bulgarian working class to the construction of socialism have strengthened the forces of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.

To the Central Council of the Hungarian Trade Union:
On the occasion of the New Year of 1952, I extend my heartfelt congratulations on behalf of the Chinese working people to our Hungarian brothers and sisters.
    Under the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party headed by Comrade Rákosi, the Hungarian working people are engaged in selfless production and labor with unparalleled enthusiasm and unwavering confidence in building a beautiful and happy socialist society. This further strengthens the forces of the peace and democracy camp.
    With a selfless spirit, the Chinese working class, together with the people of the whole country, has devoted itself to the movement to resist America and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend our country, launched patriotic production competitions, and organized transport teams, medical teams, and stretcher teams to support the front lines. Now they are stepping up their support for the Chinese People's Volunteers with practical actions of "increasing production and practicing thrift," opposing American aggression, and striving for an early end to the Korean War in order to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.
    We firmly believe that the close unity of the Chinese and Hungarian working classes and the working class of the world, led by the Soviet working class, will defeat the war-mongers' conspiracy.
    I wish you even greater victories in 1952!

On the joyous occasion of the New Year of 1952, please accept the heartfelt congratulations of the Chinese workers to all the working people of Czechoslovakia.
    Under the leadership of Comrade Gottwald and the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the working people of Czechoslovakia, after completing the Two-Year Plan, have successfully completed the first three years of the Five-Year Plan; this has greatly moved Czechoslovakia forward on the road to socialism and strengthened the forces of the peace and democracy camp.
    After achieving great victories in the just struggle to resist America and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend our country, the Chinese working class is now further launching a movement to "increase production and practice thrift" in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, thoroughly smash American imperialist aggression, and lay the foundation for the great economic construction that is about to come in the new China. The Chinese workers are confident that this action will be a major blow to the imperialist aggressive bloc and will bring about an early realization of the victory of the Chinese and Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world on the Korean battlefield.
    The Chinese workers are confident that the workers of China and Czechoslovakia will achieve greater achievements in the struggle to defend world peace in 1952.

The New Year of 1952 has arrived, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions extends warm congratulations on behalf of all the working people of China to our Polish worker brothers and sisters.
    After successfully completing the Three-Year Plan, the Polish workers have also realized the second year of the Six-Year Plan. The various large-scale modernization constructions carried out in the motherland will make Poland's economy leap forward even further, accelerating the road to socialism.
    In the past year, the Chinese workers have launched a patriotic production competition with selfless labor enthusiasm to support the great movement to resist America and aid Korea, thereby enhancing China's economic and defense forces. Now, they are further carrying out the movement to "increase production and practice thrift" to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and lay the foundation for China's large-scale construction in the future. The Chinese working class is confident that this action will greatly contribute to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.
    Let the workers of China and Poland unite more closely and strive for greater victories in 1952!

Telegram of Greetings to the Federation of Free German Trade Unions
To the Federation of Free German Trade Unions:
On the occasion of the arrival of the New Year of 1952, I extend militant greetings and sincere congratulations on behalf of all the working people of China to the German Democratic Republic and all worker brothers in West Germany.
    Today, when American imperialism is frantically preparing for war in an attempt to enslave the people of all countries, the German working class, with its glorious fighting traditions, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Communist Party of Germany headed by Comrades Pieck and Lehmann, is increasingly deeply aware of the important position it occupies and the responsibilities it should shoulder in this great struggle. It has achieved brilliant results in realizing the Five-Year Plan, building the German Democratic Republic, striving for the unification of the motherland, and striving for the conclusion of a peace treaty, strengthening the unity between the German Democratic Republic and the workers in West Germany, and will continue to play an increasingly outstanding role in the great cause of defending peace in Europe and the world.
    Today, the people's China and the people's Germany are both at the forefront of the great struggle against American imperialist aggression. German workers are opposing the rearmament of West Germany and opposing turning West Germany into an American base for aggression in Europe. Chinese workers are opposing the arming of Japan and opposing turning Japan into an American base for aggression in Asia. Especially when great victories have been achieved in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, Chinese workers are supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers with practical actions of "increasing production and practicing thrift." They are convinced that this struggle is of great significance not only in protecting the security of the motherland and neighboring countries, but also in defending peace in Asia and the world.
    The tasks of the Chinese and German people in the struggle against war-mongers are closely related. Let the working classes of China and Germany join hands and, with the help of the great Soviet working class, advance side by side with the peace-loving and democratic people of the world toward the final victory of defending world peace!

To the Central Council of the Albanian Trade Union:
As 1952 approaches, we extend our brotherly greetings and warm congratulations on behalf of the Chinese working class to our Albanian brothers and sisters.
    The entire Chinese working class is watching with admiration and firm confidence as the Albanian working class, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Hoxha, victoriously marches towards great socialism.
    The Albanian working class and people have fully demonstrated their firm will to defend world peace in the struggle against American imperialism and its running dog Tito. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese working class resolutely carries out the struggle against American imperialist aggression, increases production, practices thrift, builds the motherland, consolidates national defense, and supports the Chinese People's Volunteers who are fighting against American imperialist aggression in Korea, in order to defend the Far East and world peace.
    We are confident that the working classes of China and Albania will achieve even greater victories in 1952.
    Long live the unity and friendship between the Chinese and Albanian working classes!
    Long live the victory of the world peace and democracy camp!

Telegram of Greetings to the American Working Class
To the American Worker Newspaper, forwarded to dear American worker brothers:
The New Year of 1952 is approaching, and I extend warm congratulations on behalf of the Chinese working class to you, and wish you greater victories in the struggle to win lasting world peace and safeguard your own vital interests.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese working class has liberated itself and become the leading class of the People's Republic of China. The standard of living is improving day by day. Taking the wages of workers in Northeast China as an example, this year's wages have increased by 15 percent compared with last year, and since this year's "May Day," 10 million workers and their families across the country have enjoyed free labor insurance. This is just a beginning, and a better life is yet to come. But we know that happiness is inseparable from peace. Therefore, the Chinese workers not only played a leading role in the past revolutionary struggles, but also now play a leading role in the cause of defending the motherland and world peace. More than 344 million Chinese people have signed the declaration for a Five-Power Peace Pact, and more than 339 million people have voted against a separate peace with Japan and the rearmament of Japan. In order to defend our hard-won happiness, we must resolutely oppose American imperialism's aggression against our Taiwan and our neighbor Korea, and have launched a nationwide movement to resist America and aid Korea.
    While living an increasingly improved life, we are also deeply concerned about you who live on the other side of the Pacific. As Wall Street and the Truman administration step up war preparations and make brutal attacks on your living standards, we admire your heroic struggle to oppose American imperialist aggression in the Korean War and defend your democratic rights and living standards.
    For the common interests of our working class around the world, the Chinese and American working classes must unite closely. We firmly believe that the unity of the working class around the world is powerful enough to crush the imperialist war conspiracy. Let us join hands closely and work for the defense of world peace and people's democracy!
                            All-China Federation of Trade Unions

Telegram of Greetings to the British Working Class
To the British Worker Newspaper, forwarded to dear British worker brothers:
As the New Year of 1952 arrives, I extend warm congratulations on behalf of the Chinese working class to you.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese working class has liberated itself, established the People's Republic of China, and its life is improving day by day. Taking the wages of workers in Northeast China as an example, the wages in 1949 increased by 27 percent compared with the previous year, increased by 12.5 percent in 1950, and increased by 15 percent this year. After this year's "May Day," 10 million workers and their families across the country have enjoyed free labor insurance, and even better days are yet to come. But we know that a good life is inseparable from world peace. Therefore, the Chinese workers are not only the advanced team of the Chinese people in the past revolutionary struggles, but also play a leading role in the cause of defending the motherland and peace. More than 344 million Chinese people have signed the declaration for a Five-Power Peace Pact. More than 339 million people have voted against a separate peace with Japan and the rearmament of Japan.
    While defending world peace, we are also closely concerned about you. In the adverse environment where the reactionaries are becoming increasingly rampant, you are fighting bravely in the peace movement and in the struggle to safeguard your right to survival, and have won many victories - including forcing the government to abolish the anti-strike Decree 1305. We admire the courage and firm will you have shown in these struggles, and we guarantee that in the just struggle, we will always stand on your side.
    We firmly believe that the British working class does not want its dear fathers, brothers, and sons to be forced to be cannon fodder on the battlefield of aggression. On the contrary, they love peace. We firmly believe that the unity of the working class around the world is sufficient to crush the imperialist war conspiracy and defend world peace. Let us unite closely and strive for greater victories in the cause of defending world peace.
                                All-China Federation of Trade Unions

    In the past year, the French workers have waged many strong battles against American imperialism and the reactionary French government, and have achieved amazing achievements in defending world peace, opposing war policies, uniting more workers, organizing united actions, and improving workers' lives, strengthening the strength of the working class.
    For two years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the lives of Chinese workers have been greatly improved. For example, taking the wages of workers as an example, the wages of workers in Northeast China have increased by another 15 percent this year compared with last year. After May Day this year, 10 million workers and their families across the country have enjoyed free labor insurance benefits. The Chinese workers know that in order to protect their happy lives and realize a better future as soon as possible, it is inseparable from defending world peace.

    让中波两国工人团结得更加紧密，在一九五二年为取得更大的胜利而斗争！
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营将更加坚强与壮大。

    给自由德国工会联合会的贺电自由德国工会联合会：
    值此一九五二年新年来临之际，谨代表中国全体劳动人民向德意志民主共和国及西德所有工人弟兄致以战斗的敬礼和诚挚的祝贺。
    当此美帝国主义疯狂备战企图奴役各国人民的今天，具有光荣斗争传统的德国工人阶级在以皮克和雷曼同志为首的德国统一社会党和德国共产党的领导下，日益深刻瞭解到自己在这伟大斗争中所占的重要地位和应负的责任，在实现五年计划，建设德意志民主共和国，争取祖国统一，争取缔结和约的斗争中，获得辉煌的成果，加强了德意志民主共和国与西德工人之间的团结，并将继续在保卫欧洲与世界和平的伟大事业上起着日益卓越的作用。
    今日人民的中国和人民的德国，同样处在反对美帝国主义侵略的伟大斗争的最前线。德国工人正在反对重新武装西德，反对把西德变为美国在欧洲的侵略基地，中国工人在反对武装日本，反对把日本变为美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略基地。尤其是在抗美援朝运动中已获得伟大胜利之时，中国工人更以“增加生产，厉行节约”的实际行动来支援中国人民志愿军。他们确信这一斗争不仅在保卫祖国和邻邦的安全上，而且在保卫亚洲与世界和平上具有重大的意义。
    中德两国人民在反对战争贩子的斗争中的任务是密切关联着的。让中德两国工人阶级紧握起手来，在伟大的苏联工人阶级帮助之下，与全世界爱好和平民主的人民一道，向着保卫世界和平的最后胜利并肩前进吧！

    正当一九五二年来临之际，我们代表中国工人阶级向阿尔巴尼亚兄弟姊妹们致以兄弟的敬礼与热烈的祝贺。
    全中国的工人阶级都以钦佩的目光和坚定的信心注视着阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，胜利地朝向伟大的社会主义迈进。
    阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级和人民在反对美帝国主义及其走狗铁托分子的斗争中，充分地表现出来捍卫世界和平的坚强意志。中国工人阶级在中国共产党和毛泽东主席英明的领导下，坚决地进行反对美帝国主义的侵略斗争，增加生产、厉行节约，建设祖国、巩固国防，支援在朝鲜抗击美帝国主义侵略的中国人民志愿军，以保卫远东与世界和平。
    我们深信中、阿两国工人阶级在一九五二年将获得更大的胜利。
    中、阿两国工人阶级团结与友谊万岁！
    世界和平民主阵营胜利万岁！

    给美国工人阶级的贺电美国工人日报转亲爱的美国工人弟兄们：
    一九五二年的新年即将来临，谨代表中国的工人阶级向你们热烈致贺，并祝你们在争取世界持久和平与维护自己切身利益的斗争中获得更大的胜利。
    中国工人阶级在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导之下解放了自己，而且成为中华人民共和国的领导阶级，生活水平正在日益提高着，以东北工人的工资为例，今年就比去年增加了百分之十五，而且在今年“五一”以后全国已有一千万的工人及家属享受到了免费的劳动保险。这只是一个开端，更美好的生活还在将来。但是我们知道幸福是与和平分不开的。因此中国工人不但在过去的革命斗争中，而且现在在保卫祖国与世界和平的事业中也起着带头作用。中国人民在五大国和平公约宣言上签名的已有三亿四千四百余万人，投票反对单独对日媾和重新武装日本的也有三亿三千九百余万人。为了保卫我们既得的幸福，不能不坚决地反对美帝国主义侵略我国台湾和我们的邻邦朝鲜，而掀动了全国的抗美援朝的运动。
    在过着日益改善着的生活的同时，我们也深切地关怀着生活在太平洋彼岸的你们。当华尔街和杜鲁门政府加紧备战措施向你们的生活水平作残暴的进攻时，我们钦佩你们为反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜战争，保卫自己的民主权利与生活水平所作的英勇斗争。
    为了我们全世界工人阶级的共同利益，中美工人阶级要亲密地团结起来。我们深信：全世界工人阶级的团结一致，其力量足以粉碎帝国主义的战争阴谋。让我们紧密地携起手来，为保卫世界和平与人民民主而努力！

    给英国工人阶级的贺电英国工人日报转亲爱的英国工人弟兄们：
    当一九五二年的新春到来之际，谨代表中国的工人阶级向你们热烈致贺。
    中国工人阶级由于在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导之下解放了自己，建立了中华人民共和国，生活正在日益改善着。以东北工人的工资为例，一九四九年的工资比前一年增加了百分之二十七，一九五○年增加了百分之十二点五，今年又增加了百分之十五。在今年“五一”以后，全国又有一千万的工人及家属享受到了免费的劳动保险，而且更美好的日子还在将来。但是我们知道美好的生活是与世界和平分不开的，因此中国工人不但在过去的革命斗争中是中国人民的先进队伍，而且在保卫祖国与和平的事业中也起着带头作用，中国人民在五大国和平公约宣言上签名的已有三亿四千四百余万人。投票反对单独对日媾和重新武装日本的也有三亿三千九百余万人。
    在保卫世界和平的同时，我们也在密切地关怀着你们。在反动派日益嚣张的恶劣环境下，你们在和平运动中，在维护自己生存权利的斗争中英勇地战斗着并且获取了许多胜利——其中包括迫使政府取消了反罢工的一三○五号法令。我们钦佩你们在这些斗争中所表现的勇气与坚决意志，我们保证在正义的斗争中，我们将永远站在你们这一边。
    我们深信：英国的工人阶级决不愿自己的亲爱的父亲、兄弟和儿子被强迫到侵略战场上当炮灰，相反的，而是热爱和平。我们坚信全世界工人阶级的团结一致是足以粉碎帝国主义的战争阴谋与保卫世界和平的。让我们紧密地团结起来，在为保卫世界和平的事业中取得更伟大的胜利而奋斗。

    给法国总工会的贺电亲爱的同志们：
    兹逢一九五二年元旦佳节，谨代表中国劳动人民向法国工人兄弟们致以最热烈最崇高的敬礼！
    在过去的一年中，法国工人对美帝国主义及法国反动政府做了多次的坚强的战斗，在保卫世界和平，反对战争政策，团结更多工人，组织统一行动，提高工人生活的斗争中获得了惊人的成就，加强了工人阶级的力量。
    两年来，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，中国工人的生活大大地改善了。譬如拿工人的工资来说，东北职工的工资今年就又比去年提高了百分之十五，今年五一以后，全国又有一千万的工人及家属享受免费的劳动保险待遇。中国工人知道，为了卫护自己幸福的生活，为了早日实现更美好的将来，是与保卫世界和平分不开的，中国人民已有三亿四千四百多万人签名要求缔结五大国和平公约，三亿三千九百多万人投票反对对日单独媾和。
    一九五二年将标志着和平运动更加高涨的一年，让我们紧密地团结起来，联合全世界善良的人们，必将粉碎以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团的战争阴谋！

    当此一九五二年新春，我们代表中国全体劳动人民向你们致以热烈的兄弟般的敬礼！祝贺你们在为保卫世界和平，反对加斯贝利政府扩充军备的政策，为工人阶级的团结与统一行动，并为改善劳动人民生活的斗争中所获得的伟大成绩。
    两年来，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，中国人民的生活大大地改善了，拿今年来说，人民的购买力又普遍地提高了百分之三十，工人们的工作条件也更加改善了，并且从今年五一以后，全国有一千万的工人和家属享受了劳动保险待遇。中国人民知道，要保卫自己一天比一天幸福的生活，早日实现更美好的将来，一定先要保卫世界和平，因此，中国人民签名要求缔结五大国和平公约的人数已超过三亿四千四百万，投票反对单独对日媾和的人数也超过了三亿三千九百万。
    全世界善良的人们争取和平的运动日益高涨，一九五二年将是更高涨的一年，让我们更好地团结起来，粉碎帝国主义战争贩子们的侵略阴谋，向着争取世界和平更伟大的胜利前进！

    中国海员在毛主席与中国共产党的领导下正以苏联海员兄弟为榜样，以增产节约的实际行动进一步开展着抗美援朝，建设自己祖国的斗争。一年来由于苏联人民的热情帮助与鼓舞，已使中国各方面的建设获得了空前发展的胜利。
