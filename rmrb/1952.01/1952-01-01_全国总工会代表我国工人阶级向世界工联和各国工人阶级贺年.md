To the Central Council of the Bulgarian General Trade Union:
On the joyous occasion of the New Year of 1952, I extend warm congratulations on behalf of the Chinese working class to the Bulgarian working class, and wish you greater victories in the struggle to complete the Five-Year Plan under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party. The great contributions made by the Bulgarian working class to the construction of socialism have strengthened the forces of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    In the great movement to resist America and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend our country, the Chinese working class and all the people have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and internationalism and achieved great victories, disrupting the aggressive plans of American imperialism and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working class is carrying out a movement to increase production and practice thrift, build the motherland, strengthen national defense, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    We are convinced that in 1952, the joint struggle of the Chinese and Bulgarian working classes and peace-loving people all over the world to win lasting world peace will achieve greater victories.

Telegram of Greetings to the Hungarian Trade Union
To the Central Council of the Hungarian Trade Union:
On the occasion of the New Year of 1952, I extend my heartfelt congratulations on behalf of the Chinese working people to our Hungarian brothers and sisters.
    Under the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party headed by Comrade RÃ¡kosi, the Hungarian working people are engaged in selfless production and labor with unparalleled enthusiasm and unwavering confidence in building a beautiful and happy socialist society. This further strengthens the forces of the peace and democracy camp.
    With a selfless spirit, the Chinese working class, together with the people of the whole country, has devoted itself to the movement to resist America and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend our country, launched patriotic production competitions, and organized transport teams, medical teams, and stretcher teams to support the front lines. Now they are stepping up their support for the Chinese People's Volunteers with practical actions of "increasing production and practicing thrift," opposing American aggression, and striving for an early end to the Korean War in order to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.
    We firmly believe that the close unity of the Chinese and Hungarian working classes and the working class of the world, led by the Soviet working class, will defeat the war-mongers' conspiracy.
    I wish you even greater victories in 1952!

Telegram of Greetings to the Czechoslovak Trade Union
To the Central Council of the Czechoslovak Trade Union:
On the joyous occasion of the New Year of 1952, please accept the heartfelt congratulations of the Chinese workers to all the working people of Czechoslovakia.
    Under the leadership of Comrade Gottwald and the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the working people of Czechoslovakia, after completing the Two-Year Plan, have successfully completed the first three years of the Five-Year Plan; this has greatly moved Czechoslovakia forward on the road to socialism and strengthened the forces of the peace and democracy camp.
    After achieving great victories in the just struggle to resist America and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend our country, the Chinese working class is now further launching a movement to "increase production and practice thrift" in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, thoroughly smash American imperialist aggression, and lay the foundation for the great economic construction that is about to come in the new China. The Chinese workers are confident that this action will be a major blow to the imperialist aggressive bloc and will bring about an early realization of the victory of the Chinese and Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world on the Korean battlefield.
    The Chinese workers are confident that the workers of China and Czechoslovakia will achieve greater achievements in the struggle to defend world peace in 1952.
    The peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union will become stronger and more prosperous.

Telegram of Greetings to the Polish Trade Union
To the Central Council of the Polish Trade Union:
The New Year of 1952 has arrived, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions extends warm congratulations on behalf of all the working people of China to our Polish worker brothers and sisters.
    After successfully completing the Three-Year Plan, the Polish workers have also realized the second year of the Six-Year Plan. The various large-scale modernization constructions carried out in the motherland will make Poland's economy leap forward even further, accelerating the road to socialism.
    In the past year, the Chinese workers have launched a patriotic production competition with selfless labor enthusiasm to support the great movement to resist America and aid Korea, thereby enhancing China's economic and defense forces. Now, they are further carrying out the movement to "increase production and practice thrift" to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and lay the foundation for China's large-scale construction in the future. The Chinese working class is confident that this action will greatly contribute to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.
    Let the workers of China and Poland unite more closely and strive for greater victories in 1952!
    The peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union will become stronger and more prosperous.

Telegram of Greetings to the Federation of Free German Trade Unions
To the Federation of Free German Trade Unions:
On the occasion of the arrival of the New Year of 1952, I extend militant greetings and sincere congratulations on behalf of all the working people of China to the German Democratic Republic and all worker brothers in West Germany.
    Today, when American imperialism is frantically preparing for war in an attempt to enslave the people of all countries, the German working class, with its glorious fighting traditions, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Communist Party of Germany headed by Comrades Pieck and Lehmann, is increasingly deeply aware of the important position it occupies and the responsibilities it should shoulder in this great struggle. It has achieved brilliant results in realizing the Five-Year Plan, building the German Democratic Republic, striving for the unification of the motherland, and striving for the conclusion of a peace treaty, strengthening the unity between the German Democratic Republic and the workers in West Germany, and will continue to play an increasingly outstanding role in the great cause of defending peace in Europe and the world.
    Today, the people's China and the people's Germany are both at the forefront of the great struggle against American imperialist aggression. German workers are opposing the rearmament of West Germany and opposing turning West Germany into an American base for aggression in Europe. Chinese workers are opposing the arming of Japan and opposing turning Japan into an American base for aggression in Asia. Especially when great victories have been achieved in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, Chinese workers are supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers with practical actions of "increasing production and practicing thrift." They are convinced that this struggle is of great significance not only in protecting the security of the motherland and neighboring countries, but also in defending peace in Asia and the world.
    The tasks of the Chinese and German people in the struggle against war-mongers are closely related. Let the working classes of China and Germany join hands and, with the help of the great Soviet working class, advance side by side with the peace-loving and democratic people of the world toward the final victory of defending world peace!

Telegram of Greetings to the Albanian Trade Union
To the Central Council of the Albanian Trade Union:
As 1952 approaches, we extend our brotherly greetings and warm congratulations on behalf of the Chinese working class to our Albanian brothers and sisters.
    The entire Chinese working class is watching with admiration and firm confidence as the Albanian working class, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Hoxha, victoriously marches towards great socialism.
    The Albanian working class and people have fully demonstrated their firm will to defend world peace in the struggle against American imperialism and its running dog Tito. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese working class resolutely carries out the struggle against American imperialist aggression, increases production, practices thrift, builds the motherland, consolidates national defense, and supports the Chinese People's Volunteers who are fighting against American imperialist aggression in Korea, in order to defend the Far East and world peace.
    We are confident that the working classes of China and Albania will achieve even greater victories in 1952.
    Long live the unity and friendship between the Chinese and Albanian working classes!
    Long live the victory of the world peace and democracy camp!

Telegram of Greetings to the American Working Class
To the American Worker Newspaper, forwarded to dear American worker brothers:
The New Year of 1952 is approaching, and I extend warm congratulations on behalf of the Chinese working class to you, and wish you greater victories in the struggle to win lasting world peace and safeguard your own vital interests.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese working class has liberated itself and become the leading class of the People's Republic of China. The standard of living is improving day by day. Taking the wages of workers in Northeast China as an example, this year's wages have increased by 15 percent compared with last year, and since this year's "May Day," 10 million workers and their families across the country have enjoyed free labor insurance. This is just a beginning, and a better life is yet to come. But we know that happiness is inseparable from peace. Therefore, the Chinese workers not only played a leading role in the past revolutionary struggles, but also now play a leading role in the cause of defending the motherland and world peace. More than 344 million Chinese people have signed the declaration for a Five-Power Peace Pact, and more than 339 million people have voted against a separate peace with Japan and the rearmament of Japan. In order to defend our hard-won happiness, we must resolutely oppose American imperialism's aggression against our Taiwan and our neighbor Korea, and have launched a nationwide movement to resist America and aid Korea.
    While living an increasingly improved life, we are also deeply concerned about you who live on the other side of the Pacific. As Wall Street and the Truman administration step up war preparations and make brutal attacks on your living standards, we admire your heroic struggle to oppose American imperialist aggression in the Korean War and defend your democratic rights and living standards.
    For the common interests of our working class around the world, the Chinese and American working classes must unite closely. We firmly believe that the unity of the working class around the world is powerful enough to crush the imperialist war conspiracy. Let us join hands closely and work for the defense of world peace and people's democracy!
                            All-China Federation of Trade Unions

Telegram of Greetings to the British Working Class
To the British Worker Newspaper, forwarded to dear British worker brothers:
As the New Year of 1952 arrives, I extend warm congratulations on behalf of the Chinese working class to you.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese working class has liberated itself, established the People's Republic of China, and its life is improving day by day. Taking the wages of workers in Northeast China as an example, the wages in 1949 increased by 27 percent compared with the previous year, increased by 12.5 percent in 1950, and increased by 15 percent this year. After this year's "May Day," 10 million workers and their families across the country have enjoyed free labor insurance, and even better days are yet to come. But we know that a good life is inseparable from world peace. Therefore, the Chinese workers are not only the advanced team of the Chinese people in the past revolutionary struggles, but also play a leading role in the cause of defending the motherland and peace. More than 344 million Chinese people have signed the declaration for a Five-Power Peace Pact. More than 339 million people have voted against a separate peace with Japan and the rearmament of Japan.
    While defending world peace, we are also closely concerned about you. In the adverse environment where the reactionaries are becoming increasingly rampant, you are fighting bravely in the peace movement and in the struggle to safeguard your right to survival, and have won many victories - including forcing the government to abolish the anti-strike Decree 1305. We admire the courage and firm will you have shown in these struggles, and we guarantee that in the just struggle, we will always stand on your side.
    We firmly believe that the British working class does not want its dear fathers, brothers, and sons to be forced to be cannon fodder on the battlefield of aggression. On the contrary, they love peace. We firmly believe that the unity of the working class around the world is sufficient to crush the imperialist war conspiracy and defend world peace. Let us unite closely and strive for greater victories in the cause of defending world peace.
                                All-China Federation of Trade Unions

Dear Comrades:
On the occasion of the New Year's Day of 1952, I extend the warmest and most sublime greetings to the French worker brothers on behalf of the Chinese working people!
    In the past year, the French workers have waged many strong battles against American imperialism and the reactionary French government, and have achieved amazing achievements in defending world peace, opposing war policies, uniting more workers, organizing united actions, and improving workers' lives, strengthening the strength of the working class.
    For two years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the lives of Chinese workers have been greatly improved. For example, taking the wages of workers as an example, the wages of workers in Northeast China have increased by another 15 percent this year compared with last year. After May Day this year, 10 million workers and their families across the country have enjoyed free labor insurance benefits. The Chinese workers know that in order to protect their happy lives and realize a better future as soon as possible, it is inseparable from defending world peace. More than 344 million Chinese people have signed their names demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, and more than 339 million people have voted against a separate peace treaty with Japan.
    1952 will mark a year of higher tides in the peace movement. Let us unite closely and unite all the good people in the world. We will surely crush the war conspiracy of the aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism!

We congratulate you on the great achievements you have made in defending world peace, opposing the Gasperi government's policy of expanding armaments, in the unity and united action of the working class, and in improving the lives of the working people.
    For two years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the lives of the Chinese people have been greatly improved. Taking this year as an example, the purchasing power of the people has generally increased by 30 percent, the working conditions of the workers have also been improved, and since May Day this year, 10 million workers and their families have enjoyed labor insurance benefits. The Chinese people know that in order to protect their increasingly happy lives and realize a better future as soon as possible, we must first defend world peace. Therefore, the number of Chinese people signing their names to demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact has exceeded 344 million, and the number of people voting against a separate peace with Japan has also exceeded 339 million.
