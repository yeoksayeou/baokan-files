Comrades!

Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Party organizations in the Northeast region have achieved successes in the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and in the movement for increased production and conservation. According to statistics from the Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Trade, Railways, and the Local Industry Bureau, up to the end of November last year, the value of increased production and conservation was equivalent to 14.58 million tons of grain. There have also been achievements in leading the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. This struggle has exposed many serious problems in the thinking of Party cadres, making us more clearly aware of how frantically the bourgeoisie is adopting new tricks to erode the Party ranks, and how right-leaning thought within the Party is growing. Therefore, in order to conduct the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy more deeply, and to ideologically eradicate the roots of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, it is necessary to recognize the serious harm of the bourgeoisie's ideological erosion of the Party and right-leaning thought within the Party, and to resolutely overcome them. Without doing so, not only will we fail to implement the Central Committee's policy of "Resisting U.S. Aggression, Aiding Korea, increasing production and conservation, and preparing for large-scale economic construction," but we will also be unable to consolidate our existing achievements.

Right-leaning thought within the Party in the Northeast region is manifested in many ways. Here, I will only talk about two aspects: one is in the aspect of dealing with the bourgeoisie, and the other is in the aspect of the direction of rural economic development.

Regarding the Issue of Dealing with the Bourgeoisie

Regarding the issue of dealing with the bourgeoisie, Comrade Mao Zedong already issued a warning to the whole Party at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party held in March 1949. Comrade Mao Zedong reminded the whole Party to be vigilant against the bourgeoisie's "sugar-coated bullets." Since then, the Northeast Bureau has repeatedly issued warnings to the Party organizations in the Northeast region in accordance with the resolutions of the Party Central Committee. Despite this, the bourgeoisie's ideology and influence on the Party have only increased in the past period.

Right-leaning tendencies in dealing with the bourgeoisie are mainly manifested in the lack of necessary vigilance and struggle against the bourgeoisie's erosion of the Party, as well as in right-leaning tendencies in the implementation of policies. There are two reasons for this situation. One reason is that our Party shifted its focus to cities and economic construction, thus increasing contact with the bourgeoisie (this is inevitable), while the bourgeoisie, on the one hand, acknowledged the leadership of our Party, and on the other hand, tried its best to expand its ideological influence in all aspects, and adopted various new methods and forms to compete with the working class for leadership in politics and economics. Another reason is that the nationwide victory caused illusions among some people in our Party, resulting in some confused thinking. They believed that the nationwide victory of the revolution did not mean the intensification of class struggle under new conditions, but rather a relaxation of class struggle. They blindly accommodated and yielded to the bourgeoisie, and appreciated the bourgeoisie's flattery. As for some Party members who were originally from the bourgeoisie, it was of course easier for them to accept the bourgeoisie's ideological influence and spread this influence within the Party. These people constituted the right-leaning elements within the Party. A few of them have become traitors who collude with the bourgeoisie and steal state wealth. The weakness of the working-class composition of our Party, the lack of education in Marxist-Leninist theory, and the insufficient criticism of various non-proletarian thoughts and non-political tendencies have all aggravated the danger of the bourgeoisie's ideological erosion of the Party.

The bourgeoisie's erosion of the Party is multifaceted, and its main methods are two: pulling over; sending in.

The so-called "pulling over" means corrupting our cadres. In the anti-corruption struggle last year, we have already discovered that the phenomenon of corruption among our cadres (including some Communist Party members) is serious. These corruption incidents, especially corruption in financial and economic institutions and enterprises, are mostly carried out under the inducement of the bourgeoisie. Due to the bourgeoisie's inducement, these corrupt elements become the bourgeoisie's hidden thieves placed in state organs and people's enterprises. They sell business intelligence, sell materials, cut corners, report low prices as high, report bad as good, alter documents, falsify accounts, engage in smuggling and tax evasion, and use public names and various convenient conditions to pursue exorbitant profits for capitalists. Capitalists are willing to spend a lot of money in order to win over these corrupt elements. For example, a staff member of the Changchun Tax Bureau named Han Muwen earned 900% from private merchants every month, and once shielded seven private merchants from evading taxes of 120 million yuan. Capitalists said to them: "If the government fires you, I will support you." Capitalists also entered into contracts with these corrupt elements, stipulating "Each guards his stronghold, does not talk, no one tells on anyone, whoever is broken through will be on their own."

Another method the bourgeoisie uses to erode the Party is "sending in." According to materials from Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin, Changchun, and Jilin, a considerable number of personnel in our state-owned stores and cooperatives are sent by capitalists, some of whom have capitalists converting their stores into state-owned stores or cooperatives. In Dalian Department Store, six of the sales team leaders are all big merchants (such as the clock department, photography department, food department, etc.). Of the company's total of 1,300 people, 1,200 were introduced or recruited through private merchants, and they are preparing to appoint a big merchant as the deputy manager of the company. Among the 35 people in the company who manage prices, 12 have accepted bribes. Many of these people are informants for private merchants. As soon as prices change, merchants know it first and rush to buy. The clock department team leader of the company is a famous clock merchant in Dalian, and when he was invited to be the team leader, he made a treaty with the company stating: 1. Do not attend meetings; 2. Do not participate in learning. After becoming the team leader, he used the bad clocks from his own store to replace many good clocks from the public, and even replaced the good clocks donated by the people. Among the sales team leaders of Dalian's Grain Company, Native Products Company, and Cotton Yarn Company, there are five big merchants who also run stores in Dalian. There are also capitalists who send their children, relatives, or confidants into state-owned stores or cooperatives. They come in not to serve state-owned stores and cooperatives, but to serve capitalists. Some local state-owned stores and cooperatives have had their leadership usurped, goods switched, business intelligence stolen, goods hoarded for speculation, and the market disrupted, turning state-owned enterprises into tools for capitalists to steal public funds for private gain and engage in speculation and profiteering. And some comrades in our Party are unaware of this insidious and vicious method of capitalists, and even some confused comrades think: "Capitalists are really enlightened, even their own stores have been socialized!" "Capitalists know how to do business, they understand the business, we must rely on them."

Comrades: Relying on the bourgeoisie will mean losing the working class, losing the people, and destroying the Party and the country. Isn't this theorem clear yet?

In addition to some people within the Party lacking the necessary vigilance and struggle against the bourgeoisie's ideological erosion of the Party, there are also some people who do not try their best to strengthen and improve socialist enterprises, but instead calculate every day how to "turn large public property into small public property" and "turn public property into private property." They are not prepared to become people's entrepreneurs, but want to pursue the partial interests of their own units for the extravagance and waste of a few people, or even a few so-called "chiefs" of the organization. Even worse, they want to be merchants or factory owners, and do not hesitate to harm the interests of the state and allow private merchants to take advantage. There are also some people (even senior cadres) who use their positions to invest in private shops and factories through their families and relatives to seek personal gain. This is absolutely not allowed and must be sanctioned by national law and Party discipline. Anyone who has committed such errors should turn back quickly, confess to the Party, and correct their mistakes.

As for the influence of bourgeois ideology on the work style of some comrades in the Party, this is something everyone knows, so I won't talk about it here.

Because the bourgeoisie erodes us in this way, right-leaning tendencies have emerged in our implementation of policies. Here are a few important examples.

1. In trade policy: Some places allow private merchants to grab territory from state-owned commerce and engage in speculative illegal activities, even helping them; while they are very inactive in developing businesses and expanding the retail proportion of state-owned commerce and cooperatives. This encourages the speculative activities of private merchants, enabling them to take advantage of the weakness of state-owned retail commerce and the overcrowding of customers to raise prices.

2. When entrusting capitalists to process goods and ordering goods from capitalists, the acts of capitalists cutting corners, obtaining exorbitant profits, and colluding with public officials to steal state property are not considered illegal crimes, and are not given the punishment they deserve.

3. In tax policy: Commercial tax is lighter than industrial tax, and itinerant merchant tax is lighter than resident merchant tax, which encourages capitalists' speculative activities, turning industrial capital into commercial capital, and resident merchants into itinerant merchants.

4. In the policy of the workers' movement in private enterprises: There is little punishment for the acts of private capitalists abusing workers, dividing workers (deceiving workers into investing in the enterprise with their bodies, withholding part of the workers' wages, calling it "investment"), and violating labor laws. In some places, the labor-capital consultation meetings have even become tools for capitalists to deceive the state, deceive workers, cut corners, and evade taxes.

5. Promoting joint ventures with private merchants without principles.

The lack of serious struggle against reactionary ideas on the ideological front, the neglect of political education, and the blurring of the ideological boundaries between the working class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie are also important manifestations of right-leaning tendencies in policy. Due to the same mistakes, many of our organizations, in their personnel systems and cadre policies, abuse private relationships, allowing many counter-revolutionaries and class dissidents to infiltrate various departments, while abandoning ideological reform and political leadership for retained personnel and staff from landlord and bourgeois families, allowing their various hostile class ideas and styles to run rampant without anyone paying attention.

Some comrades in our Party often say not to be "leftist" towards the bourgeoisie, but they don't know what "left" is. We neither confiscate nor close down bourgeois enterprises casually, nor do we increase taxes beyond state regulations. We allow private capitalists to operate their industry and commerce within the legal scope and under the leadership of the state economy. This is not "left." On the contrary, if we ignore the bourgeoisie's stealing of state property, turn a blind eye to the illegal speculative activities of profiteers that harm the interests of the people, and dare not punish the illegal acts of profiteers luring our staff, then there is no doubt that we are right-leaning.

In order to overcome the bourgeoisie's erosion of the Party and to win a complete victory in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the forces inside the Party, government, and army should be combined with social forces to thoroughly expose and deal with the bourgeoisie's illegal activities such as bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence. All cities must quickly convene consultation committees, people's representative meetings, and meetings of industrialists and businessmen. After mastering certain materials, they should call on them to confess and report within a time limit; those who confess thoroughly will have their crimes reduced, and those who confess lightly will be exempted from punishment; those who report others will have their crimes offset by merit, and those who have conclusive evidence but do not confess will be punished more severely. The principle of handling is: the general bad habits such as "kickbacks" should be abolished after criticism of capitalists, and no punishment will be imposed; but for illegal acts such as bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence, they should be dealt with seriously and solemnly in accordance with national laws based on different circumstances of confession or being reported and the degree of harm to the state.

After this movement, the Federation of Industry and Commerce should be called upon to organize capitalists by industry to formulate patriotic covenants with anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state assets, anti-cutting corners, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence as the main contents.

The achievements of the past four months of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Northeast region are: striking at corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, educating cadres and the people, saving state wealth (recurring expenses of government offices have been reduced by about one-third), punishing a few incorrigible elements, and saving a group of cadres. However, the scope of the movement is still limited to the internal organs, and has not become a social movement participated in by the broad masses. The development of the movement is still uneven. The upper levels are doing better (but some are also passive), and it has not yet penetrated to the lower levels. Tax bureaus, shops, factories, mines, monopoly organs, grain organs, cooperatives, banks, construction organs, construction companies, warehouses, and governments at the county, district, and village levels, as well as urban police stations, some have only moved a little, and many units have not yet moved.

In general, it can be divided into three types: (1) relatively thorough; (2) not thorough; (3) unmoved. The situations and tasks of these three types are as follows:

(1) Relatively thorough: The leaders take the lead, the masses are mobilized, a lot of corruption is exposed, waste and bureaucracy are not thoroughly exposed, and some of the exposed problems have not been dealt with. These units should organize all personnel to thoroughly expose waste and bureaucracy, seriously deal with the exposed problems, continue to discover escapees in the handling process, and ideologically examine the influence of the bourgeoisie, and formulate methods to improve work.

(2) Not thorough: The leaders are passive, the enthusiasm of the masses is not fully mobilized, some corruption phenomena have been confessed and exposed, but it is far from enough, big corrupt officials have not been moved, or have been discovered, but the leadership is afraid to act, resulting in the movement falling into a stalemate. The administrative heads of these units must take action within two days after today's meeting (after the responsible comrades return to their local areas), otherwise they are either dishonest or bureaucratic, and no matter who they are, they will be dismissed.

(3) Unmoved: The administrative system of each unit should quickly arrange and take action within five days, otherwise the heads of those units will also be dismissed. The local Party committees are responsible for leading and supervising the enterprise departments in their local areas. This is the focus of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the future.

Regardless of which type of unit, it is necessary to convene a meeting of Party members, a meeting of Youth League members, a meeting of staff members, and a meeting of Party representatives to discuss the instructions of the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, and act in accordance with the instructions. Those who suppress democracy, suppress critics, and resist the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, regardless of what position they hold, will be severely punished.

Responsible cadres of the leading organs should lead a group of capable inspection teams to conduct inspections, and each province should draw out forces to help and inspect the counties under its jurisdiction. Less documents should be issued, fewer meetings should be held, less sitting in government offices, going deep into the lower levels, facing basic-level units such as factories, rural areas, and shops. The progress of the movement in various places should be reported to the Northeast Bureau regularly, and where there are telephones, telephone contact should be used.

This movement should achieve:

1. Eliminate corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in each department. Those who are slightly corrupt and wasteful will be criticized and educated, and those who are serious will be dismissed and investigated, sentenced to imprisonment, labor reform, and even shot. We have dismissed and expelled Labor Minister Tang Yun Chao from the Party. The director of the Shenyang Industry and Commerce Bureau, Han Yongzan, the director of the Pharmaceutical Administration Department of the Ministry of Health, Li Tinglin, and the manager of the Pharmaceutical Company, Luo Huichun, have been dismissed and sent to the court. Yu Jian, the director of the Northeast Salt Affairs Bureau, Yang Mian, the director of the Foreign Trade Bureau, and Zhu Hua, the director of the Dalian Commercial Bureau, have been dismissed. Other personnel are being processed.

2. Those who actively lead the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy work, such as Zhou Huan and Zhou Chiping of the army, as well as units where this movement is going relatively well, such as the Political Department of the Military Region and the General Office of the Government, and cadres who live a hard and simple life, such as Zhang Ziliang and Song Yanchang, and relatively simple organs such as the Ministry of Public Security and the Northeast Daily, should all be commended.

3. Through actual struggle and propaganda, establish a new morality, so that righteousness rises and evil recedes.

4. Implement the recently stipulated various austerity and conservation systems (system of dealings with private merchants, system of financial approval and accounting, system of construction approval, system of cash management, system of buying and selling and allocation of materials, system of clearing assets and management of government affairs, system of staffing, system of life, system of using houses, etc.).

Regarding the Direction of Rural Economic Development

There are also right-leaning views on the direction of rural economic development, which are mainly manifested in the misrecognition of the basic direction of rural economic development after the land reform under the people's democratic dictatorship. Some comrades believe that since the spontaneous forces and class differentiation of peasants are inevitable in economic development after the land reform, then let them develop spontaneously and differentiate. There is no need to organize peasants' mutual aid in production, let alone to raise agricultural production mutual aid organizations to agricultural production cooperatives. Some comrades also believe that we have no way to properly restrict the spontaneous forces of peasants today. Therefore, they believe that the responsibility of rural Communist Party members is not to promote agricultural production mutual aid and use the demonstrative role of agricultural production cooperation to gradually attract peasants to collectivization step by step. On the contrary, they believe that the responsibility of rural Communist Party members is to take the lead in hiring workers after economic improvement, so that they can achieve the status of rich peasants and let peasants feel that there is "hope."

What is the essence of this statement? This is a denial that peasants are the most reliable allies of the working class; this is to have the working class abandon its leadership over the peasants; this is weakness and surrender to the growing capitalist elements in the countryside. That is to say: Let the peasants develop spontaneously, let them get rich and become rich peasants, let those whose economy is declining decline, in short, let our countryside take the old road of capitalism.

The current spontaneous phenomena in the economic development of some rural areas can be said from the following aspects:

1. The rapid development of rural usury and the growth of commercial speculation. According to surveys in Longjiang, Songjiang and other places, households with loan relationships account for 60 to 70 percent of the total rural households, and borrowing households account for about two-thirds of them. The vast majority of these loans are usurious, and some farmers even sell their land and horses to lend at usurious rates, which is destructive to production. Some usurers have turned to commercial speculation. Some Communist Party members also participate in usury and rural commercial speculation.

2. It is worth noting the development of rural Party members hiring workers. Some Party members who hire workers individually even published fallacies saying: "Hiring workers is mutual aid." Therefore, little attention has been paid to the low wages and poor working conditions of rural hired labor. According to typical surveys: Hired workers accounted for 3.6% of the total number of households in six villages in Hailun and Nehe in Longjiang Province, and 2.7% in Fuyu County in Jilin Province. Statistics on the number of households hiring workers show that it accounts for about 1.3% of the number of households in Zhaoyuan County, Longjiang Province (some accounting for 1.7%), and even 6.3% in Jingyan Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province.

3. In the cooperative mutual aid groups, people and horses are not exchanged for equal value, which puts households without horses at a disadvantage (mainly the exchange of human and horse labor, and reasonable distribution is not made according to the season). The leaders of the mutual aid groups have not fully paid attention to how to assist the poor households without horses, making the households without horses in an extremely unequal position in the mutual aid groups. In addition, some Party members are unwilling to join the mutual aid groups and work on their own.

4. Labor models are only given material rewards (some too much), lacking regular political education and necessary criticism, so that some labor models are separated from the masses and lose their demonstrative role.

5. They dare not publicize socialism-communism in rural areas. They do not understand that "a serious problem is to educate the peasants." The peasants' acceptance of socialism cannot be achieved by an order on paper. It must go through a long-term and arduous education and persuasion work.

6. The laissez-faire attitude towards the leadership of mutual aid groups has led to the deterioration of some mutual aid groups, with exploitative behaviors such as hiring people and lending at usurious rates.

7. After the economic improvement of village cadres, there is a growing tendency to work alone, turning a blind eye to capitalist ideas. The growth of the tendency of corruption and degeneration of some district and village cadres (many people in village cooperatives are corrupt).

To specifically solve these problems, it is necessary to formulate a number of specific policies based on the new situation of rural economic development. I will only talk about some basic ideological issues here.

For the countryside after land reform, it is necessary to continue to help the development of the individual economy of peasants on the one hand, according to the firm and unwavering policy of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, but on the other hand, it is necessary to resolutely guide peasants to gradually collectivize through the demonstration of state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives, opposing various laissez-faire theories. This is also the concretization of the struggle to uphold the leadership of the working class and oppose the influence of the bourgeoisie on rural work issues. The view that peasants should be allowed to develop spontaneously, that the countryside should undergo a deep class differentiation, and then there should be another major revolution, or that collectivization should be implemented by issuing an order one morning when there are machines in the future, is a harmful idea.

If we do not actively guide peasants to take the road of cooperatives, but actively develop the rich peasant economy, then the rural regime will inevitably degenerate into a rich peasant regime. If Communist Party members all go to hire workers and lend at usurious rates, then the rural Party will inevitably degenerate into a rich peasant Party. This will be a complete failure of the people's regime and the Party organization in the face of the bourgeoisie's offensive in the countryside, and this is of course something we cannot allow.

Under the state power led by the working class, what path can and should the peasant economy develop along?

Regarding this issue, Comrade Mao Zedong said in 1943: "In terms of the peasant masses, for thousands of years they have been individual economies, and each household is a production unit. This decentralized individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, and makes the peasants themselves fall into permanent poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize, and the only way to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives." (Mao Zedong: "Get Organized") Article 34 of the "Common Program" also stipulates: "In all areas where land reform has been thoroughly implemented, the People's Government should organize peasants and all labor forces that can engage in agricultural labor to focus on developing agricultural production and its side occupations, and should guide peasants to gradually organize various forms of labor mutual aid and production cooperation in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit."

Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and the provisions of the Common Program are fully in line with the principles put forward by Lenin and Stalin regarding the development of the peasant economy under the leadership of the working class.

In his article "Several Questions Concerning Leninism," Comrade Stalin said: "What path can and should the peasant economy develop along in our country? The peasant economy is not a capitalist economy. For the vast majority of peasant households, the peasant economy is a small commodity economy. And what is the small commodity peasant economy? It is an economy standing at the crossroads between capitalism and socialism. It can either develop towards capitalism, as is the case in capitalist countries today, or it can develop towards socialism, as is the case in our country, under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat." (Stalin: "Problems of Leninism" 1948 Moscow Chinese edition, p. 219) In his article "Foundations of Leninism," Comrade Stalin said: "Lenin correctly pointed out in his article on the cooperative system that agriculture in Russia should develop along a new road, that is, the road of absorbing the majority of peasants to participate in socialist construction through cooperatives, gradually instilling the principle of collectivism into agriculture, initially instilling it into the sales of agricultural products, and then instilling it into the production of agricultural products." (Ibid., p. 74)

Our current situation is that the cooperative movement has developed in both the sales of agricultural products and the production of agricultural products. I will not talk about the problems in the supply and marketing cooperation in rural areas here for the time being, but only talk about the cooperation in the production of agricultural products. The basic form of this cooperation is still the collective labor of peasants on the basis of individual economy at present, but its development trend has shown that it is the main form of guiding peasants to gradually transition from individual economy to collective economy in production. Therefore, in the Northeast region, according to the policy of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, we have repeatedly emphasized the issue of developing this cooperation in the resolution in 1948, the rural work symposium in the winter of 1949, and the Party representatives meeting in March 1950.

But even now, some comrades still take a negative attitude towards the cooperative mutual aid movement. They even adopt a liberal attitude in violation of the Party's policy, failing to see that this is the inevitable road for our Party to guide the broad masses of peasants to gradually move from the small-scale individual economy to the large-scale collective economy of using machines to cultivate and harvest, denying that the various agricultural production cooperatives that have now emerged are transitional forms towards agricultural socialization, and denying that they have socialist elements. This is a right-leaning erroneous thought.

The fundamental force to ensure that the countryside gradually moves towards the road of collectivization is the leadership of the Party. Our Party must not only plan and lead the development of industry, but also lead agriculture to implement socialization step by step. To implement agricultural socialization, the primary task is to gradually change the current small peasant economy into the economy of agricultural cooperatives. To develop the economy of agricultural cooperatives, in addition to further strengthening the education of peasants on socialism and collectivization, using the personal experience of peasants in running agricultural cooperatives well, and using the experience of governments at all levels in running state-owned farms well to educate peasants, it is also necessary to plan to make peasants generally use new-style horse-drawn farm implements and partial tractors within five or six years, changing the past farming methods. Due to the recovery and development of industry, the conditions for realizing this task have begun to be available. If we do not seriously carry out this work, there will be a mismatch between the development of industry and agriculture, and there will be a phenomenon of limping.

Therefore, the rural Party organizations and Communist Party members must clearly recognize the fundamental direction of rural economic development in the process of Party rectification, criticize capitalist ideas, and oppose the right-leaning thought within the Party that adopts a laissez-faire attitude towards organizing agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation. Rural Party members and Party workers must use their exemplary role and leading role to conscientiously run production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives well, and develop the economy of cooperatives. To this end, the following points must be achieved:

1. Communist Party members should actively participate in and strive to improve various cooperative organizations in the local area, and gradually improve them so that they can be transformed into agricultural production cooperatives when conditions are available. Communist Party members have the responsibility to persuade individual farmers to participate in cooperative mutual aid. In principle, Communist Party members who are individual farmers cannot hire people.

2. When Communist Party members have surplus money and grain, they should invest in mutual aid groups, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit departments to expand production and supply and marketing. Communist Party members are not allowed to lend at usurious rates, and are not allowed to engage in reactionary behaviors such as commercial speculation and profiteering.

3. When Communist Party members implement labor mutual aid, they must adhere to the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and take care of farmers with difficult lives and slow economic improvement. Communist Party members should not exchange people and horses for unequal value with other farmers, and must oppose excluding and failing to take care of farmers who are economically difficult.

However, in the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, there is another erroneous tendency, such as violating the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, adopting coercive methods for organization, discriminating against individual farmers, or taking an impatient attitude, disregarding the various necessary conditions of peasants' voluntariness and economic preparation, disregarding the degree of peasants' political awareness, and attempting to deny or restrict the private property of peasants participating in cooperatives prematurely and inappropriately now, or thinking that large-scale collectivization can be achieved in one fell swoop in rural areas now. These are "left"-leaning erroneous ideas, which should also be opposed.

In short, whether in urban work or rural work, we must oppose right-leaning thought within the Party and overcome the bourgeoisie's ideological erosion of the Party. We must eliminate all non-proletarian ideological influences in our Party, oppose bourgeois ideas, rich peasant ideas, and oppose non-principled attitudes in ideological struggles within the Party, and oppose vulgar liberal attitudes. In society, we must also criticize bourgeois ideas and not allow all state leading organs and ideological work organs to be eroded by bourgeois ideas. As for social policy, our Party's basic policy towards the private capitalist economy is still the policy of "restricting capital," that is to say, for a considerable period of time, we must still use the enthusiasm of urban and rural private capitalism as much as possible to facilitate the forward development of the national economy, neither eliminating private capital nor allowing it to run rampant freely, but implementing a policy of "restriction." The main deviation in the implementation of this policy at present is not excessive restriction, but a lack of necessary restriction on what should be restricted, resulting in conditions for the bourgeoisie to attack us. There is no doubt that only by correctly implementing the Party's policies, repelling the bourgeoisie's offensive, strictly rectifying the Party's ranks, overcoming the right-leaning danger within the Party, opening fire on corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, opening fire on the bourgeoisie's bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence, and opening fire on the degeneration of certain Party members in rural areas, can we win the victory in the great task of resisting U.S. aggression, aiding Korea, and increasing production and conservation in 1952. Let us all mobilize and advance towards new victories under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong! (Attached picture)

    克服资产阶级思想对党的侵蚀，反对党内的右倾思想
    ——一九五二年一月十日在中国共产党中央东北局高级干部会议上的报告
    高岗
    同志们！
    东北地区的党的组织在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导之下，进行抗美援朝工作和增产节约运动是有成绩的。据工业部、财政部、贸易部、铁路、地方工业局等单位至去年十一月底的统计，已增产节约价值等于一千四百五十八万吨粮食的财富。在领导反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争方面也是有成绩的。这个斗争暴露了党员干部思想中许多严重的问题，使我们在领导工作中更加清醒地认识资产阶级是在如何猖狂地采取新的花样来侵蚀党的队伍，党内右倾思想是如何地在增长。因此，为了更深入地进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，并从思想上挖除贪污、浪费、官僚主义的根源，就必须认识资产阶级思想对党的侵蚀和党内右倾思想的严重危害，并加以坚决的克服。不这样作，不仅不能贯彻中央“抗美援朝，增产节约，准备大规模的经济建设”的方针，而且会使我们已得的成绩也不能巩固。
    东北地区的党内的右倾思想，表现在许多方面。这里只讲两个方面：一个是在对待资产阶级的问题方面；一个是在农村经济的发展方向问题方面。
    关于对待资产阶级问题
    关于对待资产阶级的问题，毛泽东同志在一九四九年三月举行的党的第七届中央第二次全会上，已经向全党发出警告。毛泽东同志提醒全党警惕资产阶级“糖衣炮弹”的攻击。此后，东北局根据党中央的决议，曾多次地向东北地区的党的组织发出警告。虽然如此，资产阶级思想和影响对于党的侵蚀，在过去一个时期内还是有加无已。
    在对待资产阶级的问题上的右倾，主要表现在对资产阶级对于党的侵蚀缺乏必要的警惕和斗争以及在执行政策上的右倾。这种情况产生的原因有两个。一个原因是我们党将工作重点转入城市，转入经济建设，因而与资产阶级的接触日增（这是不可避免的），而资产阶级一面承认我党的领导，一面则在各方面尽量扩大其思想影响，并采取各种新的方法和形式，在政治上和经济上与工人阶级争夺领导权。另一个原因是由于全国的胜利，在我们党内的一部分人中发生了错觉，产生了若干糊涂思想，他们以为革命在全国的胜利不是意味着在新的条件下阶级斗争的加剧，而以为是阶级斗争的缓和。他们对资产阶级一味迁就让步，欣赏资产阶级的捧场。至于有些党员本来出身资产阶级的，当然更容易接受资产阶级的思想影响，并在党内散布这种影响。这些人就构成了党内的右倾分子。其中少数人，已成为与资产阶级狼狈为奸、盗窃国家财富的叛徒了。我们党内工人阶级成份的薄弱，马克思列宁主义理论教育的不够，对各种非无产阶级思想和非政治倾向的批判不够，都加重了资产阶级思想对党侵蚀的危险性。
    资产阶级对于党的侵蚀是多方面的，其主要的方法是两条：拉过去；派进来。
    所谓“拉过去”就是腐蚀我们的干部。我们在去年的反贪污的斗争中已经发现了我们的干部中
    （其中包括一部分共产党员）的贪污现象是严重的。这些贪污事件，特别是财经机关和企业中的贪污，绝大多数是在资产阶级的勾引下进行的。由于资产阶级的勾引，这些贪污分子，就成为资产阶级安置在国家机关、人民企业中的暗盗。他们盗卖商情、盗卖资材、偷工减料、以贱报贵、以坏报好、涂改单据、假造账目、走私偷税，并借公家的名义和各种便利条件，替资本家追逐暴利。资本家为了笼络这些贪污分子，不惜出大的本钱。例如长春税务局一个职员叫韩慕文，每月挣私商九百分，一次即包庇七户私商漏税一亿二千万元。资本家向他们说：“公家如果开除了你，我养活你。”资本家同时和这些贪污分子订立合同，规定“各守据点，掉头不谈，谁也不讲谁，攻破谁算谁”。
    资产阶级另一个侵蚀党的办法就是“派进来”。根据沈阳、大连、哈尔滨、长春、吉林的材料，我们的国营商店与合作社有相当多的人员是资本家派来的，其中有资本家带着他的商店一起变成为国家商店或合作社的。大连百货公司有六个营业组长都是大商人（如钟表部、照像部、食品部等）。该公司共一千三百人，其中一千二百人是经过私商介绍或招聘的，并准备提一个大商人任公司副经理。该公司管理物价的共三十五人，其中十二人受贿。这些人很多是私商的情报员，物价一变商人即先知道，并争先抢购。该公司的钟表部组长，即为大连有名的钟表商，在被邀任组长时与公司订立条约言明：一不参加会议；二不参加学习。任组长后以其自己商店的坏表，换走公家的许多好表，甚至把人民捐献的好表也换走了。大连的粮食公司、土产公司、花纱布公司的营业组长中即有五个是在大连同时开商店的大商人。也有资本家派其子女、亲戚或亲信分子钻入国家商店或合作社的。他们进来不是为国家商店与合作社服务，而是为资本家服务。一些地方的国家商店与合作社被其篡夺领导，倒换货物，偷窃商情，囤积居奇，捣乱市场，把国家的企业机构，作为资本家盗公肥私、投机牟利的工具。而我们党内的一些同志对资本家这种阴险恶毒的办法，却失去知觉，甚至还有这样糊涂的同志，认为：“资本家真开明，连自己的商店都社会主义化了！”“资本家会做买卖，懂业务，我们必须依靠他。”
    同志们：依靠资产阶级，就会丢掉工人阶级，就会丢掉人民大众，就会亡党亡国。这个定理，难道还不明白吗？
    党内除了一些人对资产阶级思想对于党的侵蚀缺乏必要的警惕与斗争之外，还有一些人，他们不竭力壮大与搞好社会主义性质的企业，而天天盘算“化大公为小公”，“化公为私”。他们不准备成为人民的企业家，而要追求本单位的局部利益，以供少数人，甚至几个所谓机关“首长”的挥霍浪费。更甚者，则要当商人或工厂老板，以及不惜损害国家利益，让私商占便宜。还有一些人（甚至是高级干部）利用自己的职权，通过家庭，通过亲戚，或投资私人的商店、工厂，为自己谋利。这是绝对不能允许的，必须受到国法党纪制裁的。凡是犯了这种错误的人，应该赶快回过头来，向党坦白，改正错误。
    至于党内一部分同志在工作作风上所受资产阶级的影响，这是大家都知道的，我这里就不说了。
    因为资产阶级这样地侵蚀我们，就产生了我们在执行政策上的右倾。以下是几个重要的例子。
    一、在贸易政策上：有些地方对私商向国营商业抢地盘和投机违法行为听之任之，甚至加以帮助；而对国营商业与合作社开展业务与扩大零售比重，则很不积极。这就助长了私商的投机活动，使他们能够利用国家零售商业薄弱，顾客拥挤的机会，抬高物价。
    二、对于委托资本家加工和向资本家定货时，资本家偷工减料、获取暴利和勾结公家人盗窃国家财产的行为，不认为是犯法的罪行，不加以应得的惩处。
    三、在税收政策上：商业税轻于工业税，而行商税又轻于座商税，这就助长了资本家的投机倒把活动，将工业资本转为商业资本，座商转为行商。
    四、在私人企业中的工人运动政策上：对私人资本家虐待工人、分化工人（欺骗工人入身股，扣留工人工资的一部分，美其名曰“投资”）、违反劳动法令的行为，很少制裁。有些地方的劳资协商会议，甚至成为资本家蒙蔽国家、蒙蔽工人，偷工减料、投机漏税的工具。
    五、无原则地提倡私商联营。
    在思想战线上对反动思想缺乏严肃的斗争，忽视政治教育，模糊了工人阶级和小资产阶级、资产阶级的思想界限，也是政策上右倾的重要表现。由于同样的错误，我们的许多组织，在人事制度和干部政策上，滥用私人，使不少反革命分子、阶级异己分子混入各机关部门，同时对于留用人员与出身于地主、资产阶级家庭的工作人员，放弃思想改造和政治领导，致使他们各种敌对阶级的思想与作风自由泛滥而无人过问。
    我们党内有些同志常常说对资产阶级不要“左”了，但是他们并不知道什么是“左”。我们既不随便没收、封闭资产阶级的企业，又不超过国家的规定去增加税收，我们允许私人资本家在合法范围内、在国家经济领导下经营他们的工商业，这就不是“左”。相反的，如果对资产阶级盗取国家财产的行为置之不理，对奸商投机违法，损害人民利益的行为熟视无睹，对奸商勾引我们的工作人员的不法行为不敢予以惩罚，那么，右倾却是无疑问的了。
    为了克服资产阶级对于党的侵蚀，使反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动获得全胜起见，应把党、政府和军队内部的力量与社会的力量结合起来，对资产阶级的行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报等犯法行为，予以彻底揭露、处理。各城市必须迅速召开协商委员会、人民代表会和工商业者的会议，在掌握了一定的材料之后，号召他们限期坦白和检举；凡坦白彻底者，重者减罪，轻者免罪；检举他人者以功折罪，证据确凿而不坦白者，加重处罚。处理的原则是：一般的“回扣”等恶习，经过对资本家批评后加以废除，不作处罚；但对行贿、偷税漏税、偷工减料、盗窃国家资财和国家经济情报等犯法行为，则根据坦白或被检举的不同情况及对于国家的危害程度大小，认真严肃地依据国家的法律处理。
    在这一运动之后，应当号召工商联按行业组织资本家订立以反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报为主要内容的爱国公约。
    过去东北地区四个月的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的已有的成绩是：打击了贪污、浪费、官僚主义，教育了干部和人民，节约了国家财富（机关经常费开支减少约三分之一），惩处了少数不可救药的分子，挽救了一批干部。但运动的范围还只局限在机关内部，未成为广大群众参加的社会运动。运动发展还不平衡。上面搞的好一点（但也有被动的），还未深入到下层，税局、商店、工厂、矿山、专卖机关、粮食机关、合作社、银行、修建机关、建筑公司和仓库、以及县、区、村各级政府和城市的派出所，有的只是动了一下，很多的单位还没有动。
    总起来说，可分为三种类型：（一）比较彻底的；（二）不彻底的；（三）未动的。这三种类型的情况和任务如下：
    （一）比较彻底的：首长带头，群众动了起来，贪污揭发的多，浪费和官僚主义揭发不甚彻底，已揭发的问题，有些还未处理。这种单位，要组织所有人员彻底揭发浪费和官僚主义现象，严肃处理揭发出来的问题，在处理中继续发现漏网分子，并在思想上检查资产阶级影响，定出改进工作办法。
    （二）不彻底的：首长被动，群众积极性未充分发挥，坦白和揭发了一些贪污现象，但很不够，大的贪污犯未动，或者已经发现，领导上畏首畏尾不作处理，以致运动陷于僵局。这种单位的行政首长，必须在今天的会议之后（各省市在负责同志回到本地之后）两天之内动作起来，否则不是手面不净，就是官僚主义，不管什么人，一律撤职。
    （三）未动的：各单位都由行政系统迅速布置，五天之内行动起来，否则那些单位的首长也一律撤职。地方党委对本地企业部门要负责领导和督促检查。这是今后反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的重点。
    不论那一种单位，都要召开党员大会、团员大会、工作人员大会、党代表会议，讨论中央和东北局的指示，并按照指示行动起来。压制民主，压制批评者和抵抗反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动者，不论担负什么职务，都要严予惩处。
    各领导机关的负责干部应当带领一批得力的检查团进行检查，各省要抽出力量帮助和检查所属的县。要少发文件、少开会、少坐机关、深入下层，面向工厂、农村、商店等基层单位。各地运动进行的情况要经常向东北局作报告，通电话的地方，要用电话联络。
    这个运动要做到：
    一、肃清各该部门的贪污、浪费、官僚主义。对于贪污浪费轻者批评教育，重者从撤职查办，判处徒刑，劳动改造，直至枪毙。我们已将劳动部长唐韵超撤职，开除党籍。沈阳工商局长韩永赞、卫生部药政处长李廷琳、医药公司经理罗惠春撤职送法院。东北盐务局长余坚、对外贸易局长杨勉、旅大市商业局长朱华撤职。其他人员正处理中。
    二、积极领导反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义工作的，如军队的周桓、周赤萍，以及这一运动进行的比较好的单位，如军区政治部、政府办公厅等，生活艰苦朴素的干部如张子良、宋彦昌，较朴素的机关如公安部、东北日报社等，都要加以表扬。
    三、经过实际斗争和宣传，树立一种新的道德，使正气上升，邪气敛迹。
    四、贯彻最近规定的各种精简节约制度（与私商往来制度、财政审批与会计制度、修建审批制度、现金管理制度、物资买卖与调拨制度、清理资财与机关家务制度、编制制度、生活制度、用房制度等）。
    关于农村经济发展的方向问题
    在农村经济发展的方向问题上，同样存在着右的观点，这主要表现在对人民民主专政下经过土地改革后的农村经济发展的基本方向的认识错误。有的同志认为：在土地改革后，在经济发展中，既然农民的自发势力和阶级分化是不可避免的，那么就让其自发和分化好了，用不着去组织农民的生产互助、更用不着去把农业生产互助组织提高到农业生产合作社了。也有的同志认为：农民的自发势力，我们今天没有办法加以适当的限制的。因此他们认为农村共产党员的责任不是提倡农业生产互助及用农业生产合作的示范作用，逐渐地吸引农民一步一步地走向集体化，相反，他们认为农村共产党员的责任是在经济上升之后带头雇工，使自己达到富农的地位，让农民感到有“奔头”。
    这种说法的实质何在？这是否认了农民是工人阶级最可靠的同盟者；这是要工人阶级放弃对农民的领导；这是对于农村中增长的资本主义因素，表示软弱，表示投降。这就是说：让农民自流的发展吧，让他们去发财，去当富农吧，经济下降的让他们下降去吧，总之，让我们的农村去走资本主义的老道路吧。
    当前在一部分农村经济发展中的自流现象，可以从以下几方面来说：
    一、农村高利贷的迅速发展和商业投机的增长。据龙江、松江等地调查，发生借贷关系的户口，已占农村全部户口的百分之六十至七十，借入户约占其中的三分之二。这些借贷绝大多数是高利贷，有的农民甚至把土地、马匹卖掉放高利贷，这些是对生产起破坏作用的。有一部分高利贷者转入了商业投机活动。有一些共产党员也参与放高利贷和农村的商业投机活动。
    二、值得注意的是农村党员雇用工人的发展，个别雇用工人的党员甚至于发表谬论说：“雇工就是互助。”因此对于农村雇佣劳动的过低的工资及很差的劳动条件没有很好注意。根据典型调查：雇工在龙江省海伦、讷河等六村统计占总户数的百分之三点六，吉林省扶余县占百分之二点七。雇用工人的户数，龙江省肇源县的统计约占户数的百分之一点三（有的占百分之一点七），吉林省蛟河县井沿村的统计，竟占百分之六点三。
    三、在合作互助组内人、马不等价换工，使无马户吃亏（主要是人马工交换，不按季节作合理分配）。互助组的领导没有充分的注意到如何协助贫困的无马户，使无马户在互助组中处于极不平等的地位。此外，还有些党员不愿参加互助组，自己单干。
    四、对劳动模范只重物质奖励（有的过多），缺乏经常的政治教育及必要的批评，使一些劳动模范脱离群众，失去示范作用。
    五、在农村中不敢宣传社会主义—共产主义。他们不懂得“严重的问题是教育农民”，农民接受社会主义并不是一纸命令可以达到的，必须经过长期的艰苦教育说服的工作。
    六、对互助组领导的自流，致使有些互助组变质，发生雇人和放高利贷等剥削行为。
    七、村干部经济上升后，滋长着单干情绪，对资本主义思想熟视无睹。部分区村干部的贪污腐化
    （村合作社不少人均贪污）倾向的增长。
    具体地解决这些问题，需要根据农村经济发展的新的情况规定若干具体政策，我这里只讲思想上的一些基本问题。
    对于土地改革后的农村，必须根据党中央和毛泽东同志的坚定不移的方针，一方面继续帮助农民个体经济的发展，另一方面却必须经过国营农场和农业生产合作社的示范，坚决引导农民逐步走向集体化，反对各种自流论。这也就是坚持工人阶级领导，反对资产阶级影响的斗争在农村工作问题上的具体化。那种让农民自流发展，让农村经过深刻的阶级分化之后，再来一次大的革命，或者等到将来有了机器在一个早晨下个命令实行集体化的观点，是一种有害的思想。
    如果不是积极引导农民走合作社的道路，而去积极发展富农经济，则农村政权必然蜕化成为富农政权。如果共产党员都去雇工，放高利贷，则农村的党必然蜕化成为富农党。这就将是人民政权和党的组织在农村资产阶级进攻前面的完全失败，而这当然是我们所不能容许的。
    在工人阶级领导的国家政权之下，农民经济可能而且应当向着什么道路发展呢？
    关于这个问题，毛泽东同志在一九四三年就说过：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化，而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”（毛泽东：“组织起来”）“共同纲领”第三十四条也规定：“在一切已彻底实现土地改革的地区，人民政府应组织农民及一切可以从事农业的劳动力以发展农业生产及其副业为中心任务，并应引导农民逐步地按照自愿和互利的原则，组织各种形式的劳动互助和生产合作。”
    毛泽东同志的指示和共同纲领的规定，是完全符合于列宁和斯大林所提出的关于在工人阶级领导下的农民经济发展的原则的。
    斯大林同志在“论列宁主义的几个问题”一文中说：“在我们国家里，农民经济可能而且应当按什么道路发展呢？农民经济并不是资本主义经济。农民经济按绝大多数农户来说，是小商品经济。而小商品农民经济又是什么呢？它是站在资本主义与社会主义间的十字路口的经济。它既可能发展到资本主义方面去，如现在资本主义国家里的情形那样，也可能发展到社会主义方面去，如在我们国家里，在无产阶级专政条件下所要发生的情形一样。”（斯大林：“列宁主义问题”一九四八年莫斯科中文版二一九页）在“论列宁主义基础”一文中，斯大林同志说：“列宁在他论合作制的论文中正确指示说：我们俄国的农业应当按新道路去发展，即经过合作社吸收多数农民来参加社会主义建设的道路，将集体制原则逐渐灌输于农业，起初灌输于农产品销售方面，然后灌输于农产品生产方面的道路去发展。”（同上书七四页）
    我们现在的情形，是无论在农产品销售方面和农产品生产方面，合作运动都有了发展。关于农村的供销合作中的问题，我这里暂时不谈，只谈农产品生产方面的合作。这种合作的基本形式在目前还只在个体经济基础上的农民集体劳动，但是它的发展趋势，已经表明它是引导农民在生产上由个体经济逐步地过渡到集体经济的主要形式。因此，在东北地区，我们根据党中央和毛泽东同志的方针，在一九四八年的决议上，一九四九年冬农村工作座谈会上，一九五○年三月党代表会议上，都曾反复地强调提出过发展这种合作的问题。
    但是一直到现在还有一些同志采取消极态度对待合作互助运动。甚至违反党的方针而采取了自由主义的态度，看不出这是我党引导广大农民群众从小生产的个体经济逐渐走向大规模的使用机器耕种和收割的集体经济所必经的道路，否认现在已经出现的各种农业生产合作社是走向农业社会主义化的过渡的形式，否认它们带有社会主义的因素。这是右倾错误的思想。
    保证农村逐步走向集体化道路的根本力量是党的领导。我们党不仅要有计划地领导工业的发展，而且要有步骤地领导农业实行社会化。而要实行农业社会化，其首要的任务就是逐步改变目前的小农经济为农业合作社的经济。而要发展农业合作社的经济，除了进一步加强对农民关于社会主义和集体化的教育，用农民自己办好农业合作社的切身经验，并且用各级政府大量办好国营农场的经验教育农民外，还必须有计划地在五、六年之内，使农民普遍使用新式马拉农具和部分的拖拉机，改变过去的耕作方法。由于工业的恢复和发展，实现这个任务的条件已经开始具备。如果我们不认真进行这个工作，就会发生工业和农业的发展不相适应，就会发生跛足的现象。
    因之，农村党的组织和共产党员，在整党过程中，必须明确地认识农村经济发展的根本方向，批判资本主义的思想，反对党内对组织农业生产互助合作采取自流态度的右倾思想。农村的党员和党的工作干部，必须以自己的模范作用、带头作用，兢兢业业地办好生产合作和供销合作，发展合作社的经济。为此，必须做到下列几点：
    一、共产党员要积极参加和努力搞好当地的各种合作组织，并逐步加以提高，以便在条件具备时，变为农业生产合作社。共产党员有责任说服单干的农民参加合作互助，共产党员的个体农民，原则上不能雇人。
    二、共产党员有余钱余粮时，要投资在互助组、供销合作社和信贷部中，扩大生产和供销。共产党员不允许放高利贷，不允许做商业投机倒把的反动行为。
    三、共产党员在实行劳动互助时，必须坚持平等互利的原则，并照顾生活困难经济上升慢的农民。共产党员不应该和旁的农民作人马不等价的交换，必须反对排斥和不照顾经济上困难的农民。
    但是，在农业互助合作运动上，还有另一种错误的倾向，如违反自愿和互利的原则，采取强迫命令的方法进行组织，歧视单干的农民，或者以急躁的态度，不顾农民自愿和经济准备的各种必需的条件，不顾农民的政治觉悟程度，过早地、不适宜地企图在现在就否定或限制参加合作社的农民的私有财产，或者认为现在在农村中就可以一蹴而达到大规模集体化。这些是“左”倾的错误思想，也是应该反对的。
    总之，无论在城市工作中或农村工作中，我们必须反对党内的右倾思想，克服资产阶级思想对党的侵蚀。在我们党内必须肃清一切非无产阶级的思想影响，必须反对资产阶级思想、富农思想，必须反对在党内思想斗争中的非原则态度，反对庸俗的自由主义态度。在社会上，我们也要批判资产阶级思想，并不使一切国家领导机关和思想工作机关受资产阶级思想的侵蚀。至于在社会政策上，我们党对于私人资本主义经济的基本政策还是“节制资本”的政策，这就是说，在相当长的时间内我们还要尽可能地运用城乡私人资本主义的积极性，以利于国民经济的向前发展，既不是消灭私人资本，也不是任其自由泛滥，而是实行“节制”的政策。目前在执行这个政策中的主要偏向，不是节制过多，而是对应该节制的缺乏必要的节制，以至造成资产阶级向我们进攻的条件。毫无疑问，只有正确地执行党的政策，击退资产阶级的进攻，严格整顿党的队伍，战胜党内的右倾危险，向贪污、浪费、官僚主义开火，向资产阶级的行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报的犯罪行为开火，向农村某些党员的蜕化现象开火，我们才能争取一九五二年抗美援朝、增产节约的伟大任务的胜利完成。让我们一致动员起来，在毛泽东同志的领导下，向着新的胜利前进啊！（附图片）
