    Workers of the Sixth Group of the De County Station Loading and Unloading Supply Cooperative
    Create New Record of 184 Cotton Bales Loaded Per Railcar
    Comrade Editor: The workers of the Sixth Group of the De County Station Loading and Unloading Supply Cooperative in Shandong Province have improved the technique of loading cotton bales and achieved an excellent result of loading 184 bales per railcar on December 7, 1951 (according to the experience of Zhang Youtian and other workers at Handan Station who improved the method of loading cotton bales, each railcar could be loaded with 120 to 147 bales, while generally each railcar could only be loaded with 110 to 120 bales). The Transport Group of the China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company's Xiajin Branch stationed in De County assigned the task of loading twenty-seven railcars of cotton bales to the Loading and Unloading Supply Cooperative. The cooperative immediately called on the workers to launch a loading competition. When loading the twenty-first railcar, Tang Lianzhong, the leader of the Sixth Group, saw that this railcar was an X5 type thirty-ton standard car. He thought, "Today, to respond to the call for increasing production and practicing economy, we must maximize the effectiveness of this railcar." So, he measured the height of the car and mobilized the group workers to load it. They completed the entire loading work in one hour and thirteen minutes, loading a total of 184 cotton bales, weighing 16.77 tons. The method of loading this time was: the first, second, and third layers each flat-stacked thirty-two bales; the fourth layer stacked thirty bales; the fifth layer stacked thirty-one bales; and the sixth layer stacked twenty-seven bales, leaving space for the escort personnel. In this way, they saved the country a lot of money in transporting cotton bales.

    德县车站装卸供应社第六组工人
    创造每车皮装棉花一百八十四包新纪录
    编辑同志：山东省德县车站装卸供应社第六组工人改进装棉包技术，在一九五一年十二月七日达到每车皮装一百八十四包的优异成绩（按邯郸车站工人张有田等曾改进棉包装车方法，每个车皮可装一百二十包到一百四十七包，一般则每个车皮只能装一百一、二十包）。驻德县的中国花纱布公司夏津支公司运输组把装二十七个车皮棉包的任务交给了装卸供应社。供应社随即号召工人展开装排竞赛。装到第二十一个车皮时，第六组组长汤连仲看到这个车皮是X5型三十吨标准车，他想：“今天要响应增产节约的号召，一定要发挥这个车皮的最大效力。”于是，他量好了车的高度，发动小组工人装排。他们在一小时零十三分钟内完成了全部装车工作，共装棉包一百八十四包，计重十六点七七吨。这次排装方法是：第一、二、三层每层扁排三十二包；第四层排三十包；第五层排三十一包；第六层排二十七包，并留下押运员押车的地方。这样，他们为国家节省了很多运输棉包的费用。
