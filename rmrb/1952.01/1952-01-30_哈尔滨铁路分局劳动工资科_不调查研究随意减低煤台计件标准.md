    To the Editor: The original piece rate standard for the coal platform of a certain fuel factory under the Harbin Sub-bureau of the Sino-Soviet Railway Administration was determined in the autumn of 1950. In September of last year, the Sino-Soviet Railway Administration notified all sub-bureaus to re-examine the coal platform piece rate standards. At that time, the average labor efficiency of all piece-rate workers in this fuel factory increased by 217 percent. However, the Labor and Wage Section of the Harbin Railway Sub-bureau, instead of raising the excessively loose original standard, sat in the office and reduced the original standard by 10 percent without investigation. As a result, the coal platform piece rate standard of the Mudanjiang Railway Sub-bureau is more than twice as high as that of the Harbin Railway Sub-bureau. This approach of the Labor and Wage Section of this sub-bureau completely loses the meaning of piecework, which is very unreasonable. I suggest that relevant authorities conduct thorough investigations and research when revising standards, so as to avoid unnecessary losses to the state.

### 哈尔滨铁路分局劳动工资科  不调查研究随意减低煤台计件标准

    哈尔滨铁路分局劳动工资科  不调查研究随意减低煤台计件标准
    编辑同志：中长铁路管理局哈尔滨分局所属某燃料厂原有的煤台计件标准，是在一九五○年秋季查定的。去年九月，中长铁路管理局通知各分局重新审查煤台计件标准。当时，这个燃料厂全体计件工作人员平均提高劳动效率百分之二百十七。但是，哈尔滨铁路分局劳动工资科不但不把过松的原标准提高；反而坐在屋里，不经考查，就把原标准减低百分之十。这样，牡丹江铁路分局的煤台计件标准就较哈尔滨铁路分局的高出一倍多。这个分局劳动工资科的作法完全失掉了计件工作的意义，这是很不合理的。我建议有关机关在修改标准时要作很好的调查研究，以免国家遭到不应有的损失。
