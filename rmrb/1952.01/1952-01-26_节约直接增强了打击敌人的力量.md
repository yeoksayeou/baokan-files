Thrift Directly Enhances the Power to Strike the Enemy
By Xu Yaodong, Representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Home

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army, under the guidance of the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, not only heroically fought with great self-sacrifice to defend the motherland and assist the friendly neighboring country of Korea in its war of liberation, safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world, but also, in extremely tense and arduous battles, promoted the fine traditions of the people's army, cherishing every item, every gun, and every bullet supported by the people of the motherland, allowing them to fully play their due role and directly increasing the material strength to strike the enemy.

In a certain blocking battle, the Fifth Company of a certain unit of mine was engaged in a fierce fight with the invading enemy on the hilltop. In order not to waste a single gun or bullet from the people of the motherland, and to ensure that every shell and bullet could eliminate the enemy, the comrades put forward the slogan: "Don't shoot unless close, don't shoot unless aiming, two or three enemies get eight quick rounds, five or six enemies get a grenade, a dozen enemies get a hand mine, twenty or thirty enemies get a light machine gun." When the arrogant enemy swarmed up the mountain, the soldiers, according to the number of enemies, shouted in unison: "Eight quick rounds!", "Grenade!", "...", and the ugly enemies fell one after another before the warriors.

On the logistics front, logistics comrades not only worked hard to protect and conserve the property of the motherland in peacetime, but also actively cleaned up the battlefield after battles, using the enemy's equipment to equip themselves. Guo Zhangyan, the ordnance chief of a certain unit, after a certain battle, led logistics comrades and worked day and night in the freezing cold of thirty degrees below zero, digging out weapons and ammunition discarded by the enemy during their retreat in the snow and ice, even retrieving every single bullet from the gun barrels and collecting them together. In this operation, he also dismantled twelve tires from the damaged enemy vehicles and used them to assemble three carts.

On the transportation lines, many moving examples of saving national resources also emerged. They demonstrated a heroic spirit of selflessness and sacrifice in order to cherish the wealth of the people of the motherland. Wu Chang, a truck driver from a certain unit, was once ordered to deliver gasoline. At dawn, he hid the truck in a dilapidated house. Later, three more trucks arrived and squeezed together with Wu Chang's truck. The house was small and had too many trucks. Half of one truck was exposed outside the dilapidated house, and soon the target was discovered by enemy planes. Rocket shells and machine gun bullets fell on the truck and on both sides of the truck. Immediately, one truck burst into flames, and the situation was extremely critical. Wu Chang, hiding in a nearby air raid shelter, saw it very clearly. He thought that he must not let the four trucks be lost, as this was a significant property of the country. A high degree of patriotism inspired him. He quickly jumped out of the air raid shelter, braved the danger, took off his coat, rushed into the flames, and used his coat to extinguish the fire, finally preventing the loss of the four trucks and their full load of supplies.

The comrades of a certain unit's cart company, regardless of the cold and fatigue, carried out the winter clothing transportation task day and night. In order to protect the vehicles and livestock and reduce the load on the carts, they did not ride in the carts themselves, but drove forward in the wind and snow all night. One of the livestock in the Ninth Squad lost a horseshoe. The feeder, Comrade Wan You, fearing that the livestock would damage its hoof, quickly took off his single trousers and wrapped the livestock's hoof to continue the journey. He said: "Livestock is an important tool for transportation. It is not easy to bring them from the motherland to Korea. We must cherish them as we cherish our eyes!"

Giving full play to the enthusiasm of work and improving work efficiency are important aspects of increasing production and practicing thrift. A certain unit's truck company, due to giving full play to a high degree of responsibility to the motherland, completed the winter clothing transportation task ahead of schedule, saving the country more than 130 million yuan. In the first stage of transporting cotton clothes, the time limit was twenty days. Song Qingyun's group and Dai Ronglian's group in the company first launched a competition. Song's truck loaded up to twice as much as the original quota, and other vehicles also increased their loads by an average of one time. Under the competition of revolutionary heroism, not only was the cotton clothes transportation task completed three days ahead of schedule, but also the transportation of cotton hats, cotton gloves, and cloth socks was completed, saving more than 1,200 gallons of gasoline. In the second stage, they accepted the task of transporting cotton overcoats and cotton leather shoes, and the highest record of loading per vehicle increased by more than one time compared with the original load. Similarly, the transportation task was completed three days ahead of schedule, saving 1,560 gallons of gasoline.

Exemplary deeds of cherishing and saving national resources are also manifested in the actions of building roads. In order to overcome transportation difficulties, the Volunteer Army units actively built roads with their own labor and wisdom. A certain unit crossed five mountain peaks with an elevation of more than 800 meters and opened up more than 130 li of new roads. On the mountain ridge, there were cliffs and precipices, which needed to be blasted with explosives. In order to save explosives, even large stones weighing tens of thousands of kilograms were not blasted with explosives. They came up with methods such as pulling with ropes, filling with wooden sticks underneath to slide down the slope, digging deep pits to bury, first breaking the brittle ones with force and then removing them, and so on. Their slogan was: "Save the explosives for the American-Li bandits to eat!"

A certain anti-aircraft artillery unit, taking advantage of the intervals between battles, carried out land reclamation and production, harvesting 180,000 kilograms of green vegetables in one year, solving the problem of vegetable difficulties for the troops and becoming an example of practicing increased production and thrift on the battlefield.

The comrades of the Volunteer Army all clearly know that fighting is to defend the motherland and to defend world peace; thrift is also to accumulate national funds and build a better tomorrow for us. Therefore, cherishing and saving national wealth has become a conscious thought and action of leading organs at all levels and all soldiers. According to preliminary statistics from a certain unit, in 1951, each person saved one mosquito net, three towels, and one pair of socks for the country. They donated the accumulated labor bonuses, production dividends, and surplus vegetable money (accumulated from not being able to buy vegetables during battles) to the country, thus saving the country 4.58 billion yuan, which could be used to purchase three jet fighters. In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call and learn from the patriotic spirit of the people of the motherland in increasing production and practicing thrift, the Communist Party Committee of the unit also issued a call. In addition to donating the 5.1 billion yuan of accumulated heating fees from 1951 to three jet fighters, they also planned to turn in half of the accumulated office expenses and the three qian of oil and three qian of salt per person per day issued in the food. In terms of clothing, the overcoats of cadres above the platoon level will be worn for two years, and the leather shoes and leather hats of cadres above the battalion level will be used for two years. No new ones will be issued in 1952, and the old mosquito nets will continue to be used. They also plan to save one set of shirts, one pair of shoes, and one towel per person in 1952. All rice bags and grain bags will be turned in for old ones to be exchanged for new ones, so as to avoid loss and waste. Rice frying boxes and gasoline drums will also be completely emptied.

Our soldiers not only know how to bravely and skillfully defeat the enemy, but also know how to carefully and economically cherish and save national materials. For example, the Seventh Squad of the Sixth Company of a certain unit, in order to respond to the call for thrift, automatically organized a thrift group to study how to save. Comrade Wu Yuduo said: "In the past, we used dry lead boxes (made from rice frying boxes) to serve rice, and the rice often stuck to the lead, which was a waste. In the future, we must not waste a single grain of rice from the motherland. Before serving rice, we must first wash the lead box with hot water. The wet lead will not stick to the rice, and the grain will not be wasted anymore!" Everyone thought this method was very good, and they all followed this method afterwards.

When we left the Korean front, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting in Korea, like our great people of the motherland, was also responding to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, carrying out a vigorous and widespread thrift movement. Regardless of the front or the rear, the organs or the troops, in addition to performing combat missions, they are all seriously and enthusiastically discussing the instructions of the superiors and formulating specific thrift plans. They all firmly stated that they will not only bravely eliminate the enemy, strive to accelerate the arrival of the final victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, defend our beloved motherland, and defend peace in the Far East and the world; but also resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call and Commander Peng's instructions on New Year's Day 1952, vigorously carry out the thrift movement, better cherish and save more of the country's resources, build our motherland stronger and better, and move towards a more glorious and brilliant path!

    节约直接增强了打击敌人的力量
    中国人民志愿军归国代表　许耀东
    在伟大的领袖毛泽东同志教导下的中国人民志愿军，不但以高度自我牺牲的英雄战斗保卫着祖国、援助了友好的邻邦——朝鲜人民的解放战争，拱卫了远东与世界的和平；同时在极其紧张与艰苦的战斗中，也发扬了人民军队的优良传统，爱护祖国人民支援的每一件物品、每一枝枪、每一颗子弹，使之充分发挥应有的作用，直接增加了打击敌人的物资力量。
    在某次阻击战中，我某部五连正在与进犯的敌人在山头上展开着激烈的搏斗，同志们为了不浪费祖国人民的一枪一弹，使每一颗炮弹和子弹都能消灭敌人，提出了“不靠近不射击，不瞄准不射击，二、三个敌人卖他八粒快，五、六个敌人卖他一个手榴弹，十几个敌人卖他一个手雷，二、三十个敌人卖他轻机枪”的口号。当狂妄的敌人拥上山来的时候，战士们根据敌人的数量，不约而同的喊着：“八粒快”、“手榴弹”、“……”，丑恶的敌人就在勇士们的面前一批一批地倒了下去。
    在后勤战线上，后勤工作同志不仅在平时为了爱护和节约祖国的财产进行着紧张的工作，同时还在战后积极打扫战场，用敌人的装备来装备自己。某部军械股长郭章炎，在某次战斗结束后，带了后勤工作同志，在零下三十度的酷寒下，日以继夜地在冰雪中挖掘敌人溃退时丢弃的武器和弹药，连枪膛中的一颗一颗子弹，也都退了出来，收集在一起。就在这一次，他还从击坏的敌人的汽车上拆下了十二个轮胎，回来装配了三辆大车。
    在运输线上，也涌现了许多节约国家资财的动人范例。他们为了爱护祖国人民的财富，表现了奋不顾身忘我牺牲的英雄气概。某部汽车司机吴昌，有一次奉命送汽油，天亮时他把汽车隐蔽在一间破屋里。后来又来了三辆汽车和吴昌的汽车挤在一起。车多屋小，有一辆汽车半截露在破屋外，不久，被敌机发现了目标。火箭炮、机枪弹纷纷落在车上和车的两旁，顿时一辆汽车烧了起来，情况十分危急。隐蔽在附近防空洞里的吴昌看得很清楚，他想决不能让四辆车子损失，这是国家一笔很大的财产。高度的爱国精神激励着他，他迅速从防空洞里跳出来，冒着危险，脱下了大衣，冲到火焰中用大衣把火压熄，终于使四辆汽车及满载着的物资避免了损失。
    某部大车连的同志们不顾寒冷和疲劳，日夜执行着冬装的运输任务。为了爱护车辆与牲口，减轻车子的载重量，他们自己不坐车，终夜在风雪中赶着前进。九班一只牲口掉了一个马掌，饲养员万有同志恐怕牲口擦坏蹄子，连忙脱下自己的单裤，把牲口蹄子包起来继续赶路。他说：“牲口是运输的重要工具，从祖国带到朝鲜更是不容易，咱要像爱护眼睛一样的爱护它！”
    发挥工作的积极性、提高工作效率，是增加生产、厉行节约的重要方面。某部汽车连，由于发挥了对祖国负责的高度积极性，提前完成了冬装的运输任务，为国家节省了一亿三千余万元。第一阶段运输棉衣时，限二十天完成。该连宋庆云小组和戴荣连小组为了提前完成任务，首先发起了竞赛，宋的车子最多装到了比原定要装的定量多两倍，其他车辆也平均增装了一倍。在革命英雄主义的竞赛下，不仅提前三天完成了棉衣的运输任务，还完成了棉帽、棉手套、布袜的运输，节约了汽油一千二百多加仑。第二阶段接受了运输棉大衣、棉皮鞋的任务，每辆车装载的最高纪录比原定装载量增加了一倍多，同样也提前三天完成了运输任务，节省汽油一千五百六十多加仑。
    爱护和节约国家资财的模范事迹，还表现在修筑公路的行动中。为了克服运输困难，志愿军各部，以自己的劳动和智慧，积极修筑了公路。某部翻越了标高八百多公尺的五个山峰，开辟了一百三十余里的新公路。山岭上悬崖陡壁，需要用炸药爆破，同志们为了节省炸药，几万斤重的大石也不用炸药炸，想出了用绳子拉、用木棍填在下面顺着斜坡滑、挖深坑埋、脆的先用力打碎再加以排除等等方法。他们的口号是：“省下炸药送给美李匪帮吃！”
    某高射炮部队，利用战斗空隙，进行了开荒生产，一年中收获了青菜十八万斤，解决了部队菜蔬困难，成为战地实行增产节约的范例。
    志愿军的同志都明确地知道：战斗是为了保卫祖国，保卫世界和平；节约也是为了积累国家的资金，建设我们更美好的明天。因此，爱护和节约国家的财富，已成了各级领导机关和全体战士的自觉的思想和行动。根据某部初步统计，一九五一年每人为国家节约了蚊帐一顶，毛巾三条，袜子一双，把过去积余的劳动奖金与生产红利和战斗中由于买不到菜而积余的菜金捐献给国家，这样就为国家节约了四十五亿八千万元，可以购买喷气式战斗机三架。某部为了响应毛主席的号召，学习祖国人民增产节约的爱国精神，该部共产党委员会也已发出了号召，除已将一九五一年积余的烤火费五十一亿元捐献三架喷气式战斗机外，还准备将积余办公费的半数及伙食中增发之每人每日三钱油、三钱盐缴公；服装方面，排以上干部的大衣穿二年，营以上干部的皮鞋皮帽用二年，一九五二年都不再发新的，旧的蚊帐也继续留用。并准备在一九五二年每人节约衬衣一套、鞋子一双、毛巾一条，米袋粮袋全部缴旧换新，做到不丢失浪费。炒米箱、汽油筒也全部回空。
    我们的战士不但会勇敢机智地战胜敌人，也会精打细算地爱护与节约国家的物资。例如：某部六连七班为了响应节约的号召，自动组织了节约小组，研究如何节约的方法。战士吴玉多同志说：“过去我们用干的铅皮箱（炒米箱做的）打饭，饭常常黏在铅皮上，这是一种浪费。以后我们要不浪费祖国的一粒粮食，打饭前得先把铅皮箱用热水洗一洗，潮湿的铅皮黏不了饭，粮食就不会再浪费了！”大家都认为这个办法挺好，以后就都照着这个办法做。
    当我们离开朝鲜前线的时候，战斗在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军，和我们伟大的祖国人民一样，也正在响应着党和毛主席的号召，开展着轰轰烈烈而又普遍深入的节约运动。不论前方和后方，机关和部队，除了执行战斗任务以外，都在认真热烈地讨论上级的指示，制订具体的节约计划。他们都坚决表示：不但要勇敢地消灭敌人，争取抗美援朝的最后胜利的加速到来，保卫我们亲爱的祖国，保卫远东与世界的和平；同时还要坚决响应毛主席的号召和彭司令员一九五二年元旦的指示，大力开展节约运动，更好地爱护和更多的节约国家的资财，把我们的祖国建设得更强大、更美好，向着更光辉更灿烂的道路迈进！
