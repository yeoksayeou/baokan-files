    Taking a Stand, Distinguishing Between Friend and Foe
    ——Reflections on Reading "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship"
    Zhang Chongyi, Secretary-General and Professor of Economics, Fu Jen Catholic University
    During the ideological remolding study movement for teachers, I read Chairman Mao's document "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" and, in light of my personal thoughts, conducted a self-examination. I realized that I had many problems in my thinking.
    While diligently reading this document, the first thing that came to my mind was Chairman Mao's statement: "The Chinese have learned a lot from the West, but it doesn't work; ideals are always unattainable." I immediately asked myself, have I ever doubted this issue? Yes, when I was using all my energy to explain capitalist economics, using the logic of self-interest leading to "benefiting others," to explain how to achieve China's industrialization and make China prosperous and strong by following the path of Britain and the United States, I always felt that it had no effect whatsoever. Doubts did arise, but these doubts did not grow or develop in my mind. Therefore, it was impossible for me to seek the true solution to China's problems like China's advanced elements. For a long time, my students suffered a lot from my bad influence.
    In the past, I attributed all of China's problems to the fact that the Chinese were not ambitious enough and could not blame imperialist aggression. Chairman Mao said: "Imperialist aggression shattered the Chinese dream of learning from the West." But I did not recognize this point. I did not understand that capitalism, when it develops to its highest stage, must become imperialism, nor did I understand that today's world environment is not like the situation a hundred years ago when Japan began the Meiji Restoration. I did not deeply see that China, oppressed by imperialism, had become a semi-colonial country. Unless you have a revolution and completely overthrow imperialism, no other method will work.
    Because I did not fundamentally see the aggressive nature of imperialism, its control over China, and its close ties with the Kuomintang bureaucratic capitalists and the landlord class, I could not distinguish between friend and foe. Therefore, when I believed that I was sincerely teaching students for the sake of China's prosperity, I unconsciously became a voluntary propagandist for capitalism. This is such a pitiful and shameful thing! Because of my past inability to distinguish between friend and foe and my lack of a correct stand, I made numerous mistakes in the past twenty years, especially in the years after I took the position of Secretary-General of Fu Jen Catholic University. Everyone knows that everyone has a certain stand. One cannot be suspended in the air like the Earth. If you don't stand on this side, you stand on that side. Because I could not distinguish between friend and foe, I often mistook the enemy for a friend. In the past, in Fu Jen Catholic University, which was controlled by imperialism, the idea of "Fu Jen being one family" made me one family with imperialist elements. Therefore, in all matters, I sought "peace and intimacy" with imperialist elements without principle, thinking that it was always beneficial for foreigners to come to China to run schools. Even after liberation, I still could not see the true face of imperialism. When imperialist elements repeatedly used funding as a means of coercion to interfere in school affairs, and when awakened teachers and students demanded that the school administration be completely autonomous by the Chinese and that imperialist elements should not interfere in school affairs, I still acted as a "peacemaker" and made unprincipled compromises. Where did I seriously consider China's true interests and the nation's educational sovereignty? It was not until I discovered that imperialism would never accommodate us that I began the real struggle.
    Precisely because I could not distinguish between the boundaries of friend and foe, the teachers and students with a fighting spirit were very dissatisfied with me both before and after liberation. At that time, I thought: "I have always been enthusiastic about teaching, fair in dealing with matters, and my good intentions are not rewarded." At that time, I was truly indignant, thinking that I was really a good person! Why would others treat me so badly? Later I realized that the "good person" I considered myself to be at that time was completely "good" to the enemy's side. I completely became a tool of the enemy, increasing the enemy's prestige and extinguishing my own ambition without realizing it. The "better" I was to the enemy at that time, the "worse" I was to the Chinese people! I was like that for the past eighteen years at Fu Jen Catholic University. Because I did not have the people's stand at that time, could not distinguish between friend and foe, I could not see the bright future and the correct path. Now I can only resolve to work hard to study, stand firmly on the people's stand, and dedicate the rest of my life to serving the people and making contributions for the people.
    In recent years, I have had a feeling that when I was not aware, and my students and colleagues were not aware, my relationship with the masses was very good, and the imperialist elements were also very good to me. When my students and colleagues began to become aware, my relationship with the masses was once very bad, but the imperialist elements were still very good to me. When I began to become aware, my relationship with the masses became good again, but the imperialist elements ignored me. Isn't this a very clear example of the boundaries between friend and foe!
    Chairman Mao said: "Everything else has been tried, and all have failed. Some of the people who once missed other things have fallen, some have awakened, and some are changing their minds." I am truly fortunate that I sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for supporting me before I fell and preventing me from falling. But I am not yet awakened, but I am in the process of changing my mind. I must work hard to restudy, quickly change my mind, achieve awakening, stand firmly on the working class's stand, and serve the cause of the motherland from new democracy to socialism and communism.

    站定立场，分清敌我
    ——读“论人民民主专政”的体会
    辅仁大学秘书长兼经济系教授  张重一
    在教师思想改造学习运动中，我读了毛主席的
    “论人民民主专政”这个文件，联系个人的思想检查了一下，觉得自己思想上的问题很多。
    在用心读这个文件时，首先叫我联想到自己的，就是毛主席说的：“中国人向西方学得很不少，但是行不通，理想总是不能实现。”我马上就问自己，我是不是也对这个问题怀疑过呢？是的，在我用尽全力讲述资本主义的经济学，用那种以自利为出发而达到“利人”的道理，说明走英美的道路，来达到中国工业化，使中国民富国强的时候，也总觉得它丝毫不发生效力。怀疑是产生过，但是这种怀疑在我的思想中没有增长，没有发展，因此也就不可能像中国的先进分子那样，寻求真正解决中国问题的真理。在这长时间内，我的学生可受了我很多不好的影响。
    我过去将中国人的病症，全认为是中国人自己不争气，不能都怪帝国主义的侵略。毛主席说：
    “帝国主义的侵略打破了中国人学西方的迷梦。”我却不认识这一点。不懂得资本主义发展到最高阶段就一定是帝国主义，更不懂得今天世界的环境，不是一百年前日本开始维新时的情况，没有深切地看到中国受帝国主义的压迫，已成了半殖民地的国家，你除非革命，完全推翻帝国主义，此外无论用什么方法都是不行的。
    因为我没有从本质上看清帝国主义的侵略性，它对中国的控制，它和国民党官僚资本家、地主阶级的密切联系，所以就分不清敌我，以至在自己认为诚心诚意为中国的富强而教导学生的时候，就作了资本主义的义务宣传员而不自觉，这是多么可怜又可耻的事！因为以往的敌我不分，没有正确的立场，就使我在二十年来，尤其是在担任了辅仁大学秘书长的职务以后的这几年，就错误百出。大家都知道，每个人都有一定的立场的，他不可能像地球一样地在空中悬起。你不站在这一方面，就是站在那一方面。因为不分敌我，就常常认敌为友。过去，在帝国主义控制下的辅仁大学里，“辅仁一家”的思想，使我同帝国主义分子也都是一家了。所以一切处事，都是无原则地和帝国主义分子“求得和平与亲热”，“保存一团和气”，以为外国人到中国来办学校总是对我有利的。一直到解放后，对帝国主义的真面目，还是看不清楚。在帝国主义分子几次以经费作要挟的手段来干涉校政，而觉悟的教师和同学要校政完全由中国人自主，帝国主义分子不能干涉校事的时候，我还是以“和事佬”自居，无原则地调和。那里认真地想过中国的真实的利益，国家的教育主权？直到发现帝国主义对我们绝不迁就，我才开始真正的斗争。
    正因为我分不清敌我界限，所以在解放以前和解放以后，凡有斗争性的教师和同学都对我很不满意。我当时想：“我一向是热心教学，处事公正，好心不得好报。”那时真是心中不平，以为自己真是个好人哪！何以别人会那样地对我不起呢？后来我才明白，我那时自认为的“好人”，完全是“好”到敌人那边去了，完全作了敌人的工具，长了敌人的威风，灭了自己的志气而不能觉察。那时我对敌人越“好”，对中国人民就越坏！我过去在辅仁大学的十八年中就是那样。因为我那时没有人民的立场，分不清敌我，也就看不见光明的前途，正确的道路。如今只有痛下决心，努力学习，站稳人民立场，把后半生献身为人民服务，为人民立功。
    我近年来很有一种感觉，就是在我没有觉悟，我的学生和同事也没有觉悟的时候，我的群众关系是很好的，帝国主义分子对我也很好。在我的学生和同事开始觉悟的时候，我的群众关系曾一度很坏，可是帝国主义分子对我还是很好。当我一开始觉悟了，我的群众关系又好了，可是帝国主义分子对我就不理了。这不是很显明的敌我界限的例子么！
    毛主席说：“一切别的东西都试过了，都失败了。曾经留恋过别的东西的人们，有些倒下去了，有些觉悟过来了，有些正在换脑筋。”我真庆幸，我诚心地感谢中国共产党、毛主席，在我还没有倒下去的时候就来扶住了我，使我不再倒下去。但是我还不是觉悟过来了的，而是正在换脑筋的。我一定要努力重新学习，快换脑筋，作到觉悟过来，站定工人阶级的立场，为祖国的从新民主主义进而达到社会主义共产主义的事业而服务。
