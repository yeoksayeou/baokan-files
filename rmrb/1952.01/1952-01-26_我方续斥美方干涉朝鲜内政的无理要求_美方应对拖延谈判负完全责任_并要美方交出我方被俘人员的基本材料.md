Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 25th: At the meeting of the subcommittee on the third item of the Korean armistice talks on the 25th, the other party's representatives continued to insist on unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs and falsely accused us of intending to increase our air force strength during the armistice. Our representative sternly pointed out: "The article proposed by our side that neither side shall introduce any reinforcements of military forces, including combat aircraft, from outside of Korea, is the guarantee that neither side shall increase its air force strength during the armistice. As for the construction of any facilities within North Korea, it is entirely within the scope of internal affairs, and you have no right to interfere. This is our solemn position on this issue. No one with a clear mind can derive from our solemn position the slanderous conclusion that we intend to increase our air force strength during the armistice, as you said. The discussion of the third item has lasted for nearly two months, and a full agreement has not been reached so far, entirely because your side insists on unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs. The responsibility for delaying the negotiations lies entirely with your side."

At the meeting of the subcommittee on the fourth item, our representative refuted in detail the other party's so-called principle of "one-for-one exchange," the so-called condition of "exchanging civilians for prisoners of war," the fallacy of "reclassifying our captured personnel as civilians," and the excuse of "voluntary repatriation." Our representative pointed out that regarding displaced civilians, both sides should unconditionally assist them in returning to their homes after the armistice, and they should not be allowed to be confused with prisoners of war, let alone allowed to conduct any population transactions. During the war, the other party forcibly abducted hundreds of thousands of civilians from our areas. After the armistice, the other party has every obligation to repatriate them all. Regarding what the other party has repeatedly claimed, that a large number of our captured personnel have been reclassified as "detained civilians," we absolutely cannot allow this conspiracy to detain our captured personnel. The other party themselves have repeatedly claimed that soldiers of one belligerent party who fall under the power of the enemy should be treated as prisoners of war. Therefore, the other party has no reason to arbitrarily reclassify our captured personnel as civilians, contradicting themselves. Prisoners of war held by both sides have the inalienable right to be unconditionally released and repatriated after the cessation of hostilities, which shall not be violated under any pretext. No one has any reason to bring them to the exchange point for so-called selection. Our representative also repeatedly questioned the other party about the basic information of our captured personnel, demanding that the other party hand over the identification materials of the ranks and departments of our captured personnel, which should have been handed over long ago, the materials of our discrepancy of 1,456 people, and the materials of the whereabouts of our 44,205 people. However, the other party still shamelessly claimed: "The materials may be ready tomorrow, it may take another week, it may take another thirty-eight days, I just don't know when they will be ready." Our representative denounced the other party's shameless attitude, pointing out that the other party has every responsibility to quickly hand over the basic information about our captured personnel.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 24th: At the meeting of the subcommittee on the third item of the Korean armistice talks on the 24th, our representative refuted in detail every excuse of the other party's attempt to interfere in our internal affairs, pointing out that our plan of January 9th, suggesting that neither side should introduce any reinforcements of military forces, including combat aircraft, from outside of Korea during the armistice, guarantees that the air force strength of both sides in Korea will not increase. The other party's insistence on its unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs is unreasonable. The other party clearly admits that interfering with our right to handle airport equipment within North Korea is interference in our internal affairs, and also clearly knows that this unreasonable demand is absolutely unacceptable to us, but still stubbornly insists on this unreasonable demand, which cannot but make us deeply suspect whether the other party has the desire to reach an armistice.

At the meeting of the subcommittee on the fourth item, our representative again urged the other party to submit the materials regarding the discrepancy of 1,456 of our captured personnel and the whereabouts of 44,205 of our captured personnel. The other party not only continued to avoid discussing the issue of basic information about our captured personnel, but also stated again that they had "reclassified" 44,205 of our captured personnel as civilians. Our representative sternly pointed out that among the 44,205 of our personnel with names and ranks, more than 34,000 are our regular soldiers, and the rest are our irregular soldiers. Any conspiracy to abolish their status as prisoners of war cannot be realized. Our representative requested that the other party provide a specific and clear answer to the issue of basic information about our captured personnel tomorrow.

    我方续斥美方干涉朝鲜内政的无理要求
    美方应对拖延谈判负完全责任
    并要美方交出我方被俘人员的基本材料
    【新华社开城二十五日电】二十五日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，对方代表仍然坚持干涉我方内政的无理要求，并诬指我方意图在停战期间增加空军力量。我方代表严词指出：“我方提出的双方不得从朝鲜境外进入任何增援的军事力量，包括作战飞机的条文，就是双方不得在停战期间增加空军力量的保证。至于朝鲜境内任何设备的修建则完全属于内政范围，你方无权过问。这就是我方对于这个问题的严正立场。任何头脑清醒的人，都不能从我方这个严正立场当中，得出你们所说的我方企图在停战期间增加空军力量的诬蔑性结论。第三项议程的讨论已近两月，至今未能达成全部协议，完全是由于你方坚持干涉我方内政的无理要求。拖延谈判的责任完全在于你方。”
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表详尽地驳斥了对方所谓“一对一交换”的原则，所谓“以平民交换战俘”的条件，所谓“将我方被俘人员重新分类为平民”的谬论，所谓“自愿遣返”的藉口。我方代表指出，关于失所平民，停战后双方应该无条件地协助他们归还家园，不能容许将他们和战俘混作一谈，更不能容许进行任何人口交易。对方在战争期间在我方地区强迫掳去数十万平民，停战后，对方有一切义务将他们全体遣返。关于对方所一再声称的，已将大批我方被俘人员重新分类为“被拘留的平民”，我方绝对不能容许这种扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋。对方自己曾一再声称，交战一方的军人落在敌方权力之下者，应该作为战俘，因此，对方更没有任何理由自相矛盾地随意将我方被俘人员重新分类为平民。双方所收容的战俘，有其在敌对行为终止后无条件被释放与被遣送的不可剥夺的权利，不容许在任何藉口之下加以侵犯。任何人没有任何理由能将他们带到交换地点进行所谓选择。我方代表并再次追问对方有关我方被俘人员的基本材料，要求对方交出早应交来的我方被俘人员级别和部别的识别材料，我方一千四百五十六人差额的材料，我方四万四千二百零五人下落的材料。但对方却仍然无赖地声称：“材料可能在明天准备好，可能还需要一星期，可能还需要三十八天，我就是不知道什么时候准备好。”我方代表痛斥对方这种无赖的态度，指出对方有一切的责任迅速交出有关我方被俘人员的基本材料。
    【新华社开城二十四日电】二十四日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表详尽地驳斥了对方企图干涉我方内政的每一藉口，指出我方一月九日的方案，建议双方在停战期间不从朝鲜境外进入任何增援的军事力量，包括作战飞机在内，就保证了双方在朝鲜的空军力量不会有所增加，对方坚持其干涉我方内政的无理要求，是没有任何道理的。对方明白承认干涉我方处理朝鲜境内机场设备的权利，是对我方内政的干涉，也明白知道这种无理要求是我方所绝对不能容许的，但却仍然强词夺理地坚持这一无理要求，这就不能不使我方深深地怀疑对方究竟有无达成停战的愿望。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表再度催促对方提交有关一千四百五十六名我方被俘人员的差额和四万四千二百零五名我方被俘人员的下落的材料。对方不但继续避免讨论有关我方被俘人员的基本材料的问题，并再度表示已将我方四万四千二百零五名被俘人员“重新分类”为平民。我方代表严词指出，四万四千二百零五名有名有姓的我方人员中三万四千多人是我方正规军人，其余也是我方的非正规军人，任何取消他们战俘身份的阴谋是不能实现的。我方代表要求对方明日对于我方被俘人员的基本材料的问题提出具体明确的答复。
