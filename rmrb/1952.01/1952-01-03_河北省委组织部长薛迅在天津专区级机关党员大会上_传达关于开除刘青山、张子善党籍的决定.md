To learn a painful lesson from the major corruption case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, vigorously carry out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and thoroughly eliminate the vile influence of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan's betrayal of the Party and the people in the Tianjin area Party organization, the Tianjin District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a general meeting of all Party members of district-level organs and groups on the afternoon of December 17th last year. Comrade Xue Xun, Minister of the Organization Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, conveyed the "Resolution of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on Expelling Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Party." A total of 467 Party member cadres attended the meeting.

In conveying the provincial party committee's resolution, Comrade Xue Xun thoroughly exposed the shameless crimes of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan in betraying the Party, betraying the class, and betraying the people, and analyzed in detail the ideological roots of their crimes. Comrade Xue Xun called on all Party members to: First, fully recognize the serious harm that Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan's criminal behavior has caused to the Party, the country, and the people. The seriousness of this harm lies in the fact that they have completely degenerated and fallen to the point of wearing the cloak of Communists, occupying leading positions, and spreading the decadent ideological toxins of the bourgeoisie. This easily causes some comrades with low political acumen or who are relatively naive to be confused by them, unable to distinguish between right and wrong, and black and white; even some Party members with unhealthy ideological consciousness are captured by their shameless enticements and follow them. Relying on their leading positions, they suppress democracy and abolish criticism and self-criticism within the Party. They arbitrarily abuse, retaliate against, attack, and even frame those comrades who are upright and loyal to the Party, completely suffocating the vitality within the Party. This is a fatal harm to the Party. Now it is completely impossible for imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang to seize the fruits of victory of the Chinese people by armed force, but the enemy can take measures to corrupt our Party, take measures to shoot arrows in the dark and fire sugar-coated bullets, and find their allies from within us to destroy us. Liu and Zhang surrendered in the face of the enemy's sugar-coated bullets, and they themselves became sugar-coated bullets, and became moths that shoot poison at the Party. We must remember that fortresses are most easily breached from within. We must deeply recognize that the struggle against Liu and Zhang's crimes of corruption and theft is a highly principled struggle against the corrosive bourgeois ideology invading the Party, and a struggle to maintain the proletarian purity and health of the Party organization. We must resolutely eliminate the influence of decadent liberal bourgeois and Kuomintang styles on the Party.

Comrade Xue Xun emphasized that the Provincial Party Committee requires every Party member to draw a clear ideological line between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie from the struggle against the criminal behavior of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, and to raise their awareness a step further in ideological understanding. Comrade Xue Xun conducted education based on the different situations of Party member cadres at the Tianjin Special District level organs and the different ideological situations of Party member cadres who have entered a week of rectification and study. He said: A section of Party members who have fought against the criminal behavior of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan in the past and present must further clarify the principled nature of the struggle and resolutely fight to the end against all bad tendencies that corrupt the Party and destroy the Party, and currently, first of all, the corrupt bourgeois ideology that harms the Party within the Party. A section of Party members who fear that the higher Party organization will not fully support the handling of Liu and Zhang's crimes must abandon their doubts; the struggle against Liu and Zhang's crimes has become a struggle to protect the health of the Party and safeguard the interests of the Party and the people, and is a historical struggle of the entire Party. Relaxing this struggle will hinder the cause of our Party and the people, and we will make serious mistakes. Therefore, all Party members must put aside all concerns, bravely participate in this principled struggle, to defend the purity of the Party and improve themselves.

A section of Party members who do not know much about Liu and Zhang's crimes and have little relationship with them therefore hold a not-so-caring attitude, which is wrong. They should train themselves to be stronger from this internal Party struggle and become a good Communist Party member. A very small number of Party members who are more or less involved in the crimes of Liu and Zhang must be determined to put down their burdens and dare to expose their past mistakes; today, being able to draw a clear line from the ideological point of view and resolutely stand on the side of the Party and the people, and frankly explain the problem to the Party is a manifestation of progress. The Party welcomes this progress. Those who can do this will be given appropriate lenient treatment by the Party according to the size of the problem; otherwise, the Party will not be tolerant.

Comrade Xue Xun finally pointed out that the Tianjin area Party organization and the vast majority of Party member cadres are good, and are actively working hard and honestly serving the people. People like Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan are a very small minority. After this struggle to eliminate the influence of decadent bourgeois ideology, the Tianjin area Party organization will become stronger and more closely united with the broad masses of the people in the Tianjin Special District, victoriously promote the patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy, and welcome the upcoming large-scale economic construction tasks.

    河北省委组织部长薛迅在天津专区级机关党员大会上
    传达关于开除刘青山、张子善党籍的决定
    为了接受刘青山、张子善大贪污案的痛心教训，大张旗鼓地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，彻底肃清刘青山、张子善叛党叛人民的罪恶行为在天津地区党组织中的恶劣影响，在去年十二月十七日下午，中共天津地委召开了专区级各机关团体全体党员大会，由中共河北省委组织部部长薛迅同志传达了“中国共产党河北省委员会关于开除刘青山、张子善党籍的决议”。参加大会的党员干部共四百六十七人。
    薛迅同志在传达省委决议中，彻底揭发了刘青山、张子善背叛党、背叛阶级和背叛人民的无耻罪行，并详细分析了他们二人犯罪的思想根源。薛迅同志号召全体党员：首先必须充分认识到刘青山、张子善的罪恶行为对党、对国家、对人民的严重危害性。这种危害的严重性，就在于他们已经完全蜕化堕落到穿着共产党人的外衣，占据领导地位，来散布腐朽的资产阶级的思想毒素，这就很容易使
    一些政治嗅觉低或较幼稚的同志，被他们所迷惑，分辨不清是非和黑白；甚至有的思想意识不健康的党员，竟被他们的无耻拉拢所俘掳，跟着他们走。他们凭借着领导地位，压抑民主，取消党内的批评和自我批评。他们随便谩骂、报复、打击、甚至陷害那些作风正派、对党忠实的同志，完全窒息了党内的生气，这是对党的致命的危害。现在帝国主义和蒋匪帮用武装力量夺取中国人民的胜利果实，已经是完全不可能的了，但敌人可以采取腐蚀我党的办法，采取放暗箭放糖弹的办法，从我们内部来寻找他们的同盟者，来破坏我们。刘、张二人就是在敌人的糖弹面前缴械投降，而且他们本身也变成了糖弹，并成为向党射击毒素的蟊贼。我们要记住堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的，我们要深刻认识到反对刘、张二人贪污盗窃罪行的斗争，就是反对腐朽的资产阶级思想侵蚀党的高度原则性的斗争，是保持党的组织的无产阶级纯洁和健康的斗争。我们要坚决肃清腐朽的自由资产阶级和国民党作风给党的影响。
    薛迅同志强调指出：省委要求每一个党员，都要从反对刘青山、张子善罪恶行为的斗争中，划清无产阶级和资产阶级的思想界限，从思想认识上把觉悟提高一步。薛迅同志根据天津专区级机关党员干部中不同的情况，和党员干部进入整风学习一周来不同的思想情况，进行了教育。他说：一部分过去和现在一直和刘青山、张子善的罪恶行为进行过斗争的党员，要更明确斗争的原则性，坚决地和腐蚀党、破坏党的一切恶劣倾向，目前首先是在党内侵害党的腐朽的资产阶级思想斗争到底。一部分怕上级党对处理刘、张罪行问题不能撑腰到底的党员，必须放弃怀疑态度；对刘、张罪行的斗争，已成为保护党的健康，维护党和人民利益的斗争，是全党带有历史意义的斗争，放松这个斗争，就要会使我们党和人民的事业受到阻碍，我们就会犯严重的错误。因此所有的党员都要放下一切顾虑，勇敢地参加这一原则斗争，来保卫党的纯洁和提高自己。
    一部分党员对刘、张罪行了解不多，关系不大，因而抱着不大关心的态度，这是错误的。应当从这个党内斗争中，把自己锻炼得更加坚强，成为一个好的共产党员。极少数的一部分和刘、张罪行或多或少有所牵连的党员，要决心放下包袱，勇于揭发过去的错误；今天能从思想上划清界限，坚决地站到党和人民方面，把问题坦白地向党交代清楚这就是进步的表现。党是欢迎这种进步的。能这样作的，党会依据问题的大小，给以适当的从轻的处理；否则党是不会宽容的。
    薛迅同志最后指出：天津地区党组织和绝大多数党员干部都是好的，都是积极努力和老老实实为人民服务的，像刘青山、张子善这样的人是极少数的。天津地区的党组织，经过这次肃清腐朽的资产阶级思想影响的斗争，必将更加坚强起来，更加密切地和天津专区广大人民在一起，胜利地推进爱国增产节约运动，迎接将要到来的大规模的经济建设任务。
