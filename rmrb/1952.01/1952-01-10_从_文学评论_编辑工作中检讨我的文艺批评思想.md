    Examining My Literary Criticism Thought from the Editing Work of "Literary Review"
    Wang Shuming

    I.

    The supplement "Literary Review" of "Guangming Daily" was co-founded by me and a few friends. From the beginning, this publication had the nature of a coterie and had no definite direction or purpose. We occasionally talked about it and felt that the atmosphere of literary criticism at the time was too silent and needed a publication to stir it up, so we contacted the newspaper and started it.

    Among the few people, I was the editor-in-chief and responsible for this publication, and also a Communist Party member, so I am heavily responsible for the poor performance of this publication.

    Since I was a Party member, what was I thinking when I participated in the editing of this publication at that time?

    My motives were impure.

    When I came to Beijing to participate in literary work, I felt that my administrative position was too small, and I was "not famous in my time." Compared with many other comrades, I was really "inferior." I felt that since the organization did not trust me and did not give me special favor, I could only make a name for myself. Running a publication was one way to find my own way.

    I also had another idea at the time, that is, not to put the publication on the "People's Daily," but to publish it in newspapers of other parties. Why is this? I felt that the "People's Daily" was the Party newspaper, and our articles would be subject to censorship, which was undoubtedly a "shackle," and I could not tolerate this "shackle." I, who have always been very self-important, did not want my articles to be modified by others. As for being rejected, I considered it a great shame. If such a thing happened, I would break off contact with this publication. My arrogance and ignorance, not knowing the thickness of heaven and earth, actually reached such an unbelievable degree!

    I felt that there were several advantages to being published in "Guangming Daily": First, it was not subject to censorship. I could say whatever I wanted. The world was vast and I could let myself go and be "free." Second, since it was a newspaper run by the China Democratic League, even if the Party wanted to interfere or lead, it would be inconvenient. I was isolating myself from the Party in this way. When I first started this publication, I took an opposing attitude to the organization and deliberately avoided accepting the Party's leadership, regarding accepting the Party's leadership as a kind of "interference" and "shackle." Where was there the slightest smell of a Communist Party member! Not only should a Communist Party member not do this, but even a progressive democrat, I think, would never do this. The Party's political prestige today has been unprecedentedly enhanced among the masses. Many truly progressive democrats voluntarily request to accept the Party's guidance, but I, on the contrary, do not do this, lowering the level of a Party member to even worse than the progressive masses. This is such a serious danger!

    I thought that I was engaged in literary work and had a small administrative position, so I inevitably felt "unappreciated." In fact, this is very wrong. A Party member should only honestly serve the working class and the people, and should not consider anything else. But I put personal interests above everything else. For the sake of personal interests, I would rather let the Party's interests and the Party's influence and prestige among the masses be damaged without feeling sorry. This has lost the basic quality of a Communist Party member. Among the friends who edited "Literary Review" with me, I was the only Communist Party member at the time. I did not play the due role of a Party member. If some of them also had the idea of engaging in petty tricks and were dissatisfied with the leadership, I did not try to persuade them and guide them to abandon that small circle and accept correct leadership. On the contrary, I myself also had that absurd idea, and even fueled its growth. Is this something a Communist Party member should do? I have degenerated into a political mediocrity without realizing it.

    II.

    Leaving the leadership and instructions of the Party to edit literary publications, and breaking into things and bumping around individualistically, without a clear direction and goal, and unwilling to resolutely take responsibility for the people, only regarding it as a coterie thing. The publication eventually made mistakes and went to failure, which was unavoidable.

    During this literary rectification study, Comrade Ding Ling pointed out in her speech at the conference that "the editing attitude of "Literary Review" is not serious." I was very unhappy when I heard this. I felt that I had put a lot of effort into this publication, and it could not be said that there was no achievement at all. How could it be said that its "attitude is not serious"? Later, after much thought, and after reading the articles published in "Literary Review" from beginning to end, I felt that what Comrade Ding Ling pointed out was completely appropriate.

    If you insist on saying that the "editing attitude is serious," then where is this "serious attitude"? As mentioned earlier: this publication has no clear direction and goal. I remember that we often said at the time: ""Literary Review" must have combat effectiveness." But what kind of "combat effectiveness" is it? Who are we "fighting"? Is it against the literary arts of the feudal class? Is it against the literary arts of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie? Looking back carefully today, we have not fought a single hard battle with these bad works. We were very indifferent to the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun." We had published nearly flattering articles about Xiao Yemu's works twice. After the criticism began, we did not make any self-criticism, and we did not carefully study his works in a more in-depth way, writing serious critical articles to correct the wrong impressions that still existed among readers. Can all of this be said to be "serious attitude"? The fact is very obvious: if a literary publication leaves the leadership and instructions of the Party, does not cooperate with the current political tasks, and acts cleverly, replacing policies with feelings, then the editor of this publication can only become a political blind man, and the progress of this publication will inevitably lose its direction. It will blindly bump around like Don Quixote, regarding windmills as giants, thinking that it is a great hero, but in fact it has not done a single decent thing. The fact is also true. The main focus of criticism in our publication was not to fight against the literary and artistic thoughts of the feudal class, the bourgeoisie, and the petty bourgeoisie from the beginning, but to find some writers who have made significant achievements in new literary creation, such as Comrades Zhao Shuli and Ding Ling... etc., and start a fire on their heads, preparing to defeat these people in order to show off their skills. This is completely blind and reckless, not distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves, and is a manifestation of the petty bourgeoisie's extreme individualism.

    Secondly, we also often said: "The publication must have mass character." Some people were proud of this, thinking that this was a characteristic of "Literary Review." In fact, the so-called "the publication must have mass character," even looking at this sentence itself, the meaning is not clear. What kind of "masses" are we referring to? Workers, peasants, and soldiers? Or petty citizens? Or outside of these two? If we do not distinguish between right and wrong, and take the hobbies and interests of petty citizens as the object of catering to and accommodating, then it will be terrible. We did not do a good job of studying and analyzing the opinions from the masses, distinguishing which ones were correct and which ones were incorrect. Some of us were complacent as long as we heard praise, thinking that the publication really achieved "mass character." In fact, this is blind self-confidence. Now, thinking carefully, many readers' opinions are not completely correct, or even wrong, and we have not distinguished them and accepted them all, which is very undesirable.

    Also, we are irresponsible in handling manuscripts. The vast majority of articles published in "Literary Review" have been seen by me. As a mainly responsible editor, how did I treat these manuscripts? I have not re-read the objects of criticism in many submissions, and I published them based only on shallow and unreliable memories, thinking that they were probably as the critics pointed out. What an unserious editing attitude!

    It is precisely because my editing attitude is not serious that there are many problems. For example, although the novel "On the Yellow River Embankment" has shortcomings, it is definitely not as serious or useless as the reader Zixi said! I published it without considering it. The content of the criticism in that article exaggerated some of the shortcomings in the work, and did not point out any of the advantages. If I had read the original work carefully again at that time, I might have discovered the unfairness of this criticism, but I did not do so.

    Another example is Yang Shuxian's article "Opinions on Two Questions" (see "Literary Review" Issue 23), which criticized the two poems "MacArthur's Timetable" and "American Ruffians, Listen Up!" However, his quotations broke the original poem's upper and lower sentences out of context, only selecting the parts that were convenient for his own arguments for excerpting, so that looking at the quotations alone seemed quite reasonable. If the whole poem is read in context, it can be seen that the author's arguments are far-fetched and cannot be self-justified in many places. I published such a out-of-context article without changing a word.

    All of the above shows that our editing attitude is very casual, and there is no attitude of being responsible to the people at all. Can Comrade Ding Ling's criticism of "Literary Review" be said to be excessive?

    III.

    Many of my own articles were published in "Literary Review." Just as my editing attitude is not serious, my writing attitude is also not serious. The publication is run by myself, and there is convenience for publishing articles. And I have always been arrogant, unwilling to easily let others modify my articles, unwilling to accept leadership, unwilling to humbly adopt other people's opinions, and more fundamentally, lacking an attitude of being responsible to the people. Therefore, some of the arguments in my articles are wrong. Among them, the most absurd point of view is the article "On the Correct Attitude of Criticism" published under the pseudonym Qiu Zuying ("Literary Review" Issue 37).

    Before analyzing the content errors of this article, let me first talk about my literary criticism thought.

    The role of literary criticism is of course to guide creation, but I believe that to carry out criticism, there must first be creation. The current literary and art circles not only have a low level of creation, but also have an insufficient output. Although there are many reasons for this, many writers feel the severe atmosphere of literary criticism and dare not write, and fear is also one of the reasons. I feel that the critical articles of individual comrades are indeed a bit too "harsh," so I associate it with the current sluggish phenomenon in the creation circles, thinking that criticism should be "fair" and should not be "excessive," so as not to hinder the development of creation. In fact, my so-called "fair" and "not excessive" theory is a right-leaning thought in literary criticism.

    I also feel that the united front in the literary and art circles should also be taken care of. When criticizing the works of those old writers and middle-aged writers, we should encourage more and point out less, and promote their advantages, and not excessively expose their shortcomings. Look! Aren't many of them already crying out bitterly about literary criticism?

    In my criticism thought, there is a lack of the most basic thing, that is, as Comrade Hu Qiaomu pointed out: to establish the ideological leadership of the working class on the literary and art front. The errors in many of my views all stem from the root cause that such a basic idea has not been established.

    I feel that the output of creation should be abundant, but I don't know that in addition to quantity, what is more important is quality. Literature and art are tools for educating the people. If a large number of works with bad ideological content are discovered in the creation circles and allowed to spread, the effect on the people will not be beneficial but harmful. Such works need to be severely criticized without mercy, so that both the people and the writers themselves can be educated, so that literary creation can develop normally.

    I only saw that some writers were dissatisfied with literary criticism and cried out bitterly, but I did not carefully investigate where these buzzing sounds came from, and I believed and completely sympathized with it without thinking. In fact, these are some writers from the petty bourgeoisie, or individual writers with reactionary bourgeois ideas. They themselves neither approach the workers, peasants, and soldiers, nor are they willing to carry out ideological transformation, and would rather preserve the ideological kingdom of the petty bourgeoisie or the bourgeoisie in the depths of their souls. It is these people who lament the "excessive" criticism. And I, without realizing it, supported this extremely wrong clamor, boosting their arrogance, speaking for them, lowering the prestige of correct literary criticism, standing on the side of non-proletarian ideology, giving up class struggle, sympathizing with the enemy, and becoming the tail of wrong and even reactionary clamors.

    I did not know that for these people, it is only natural for them to make the same voice of criticizing "excessive" from all corners. The reason why these people are incessant is that their original intention is to reject and not want criticism, using this as a shield in an attempt to achieve the purpose of preserving their own ideological kingdom of the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie. If they want to create, but are unwilling to give up their original petty bourgeois feelings, or even the reactionary bourgeois viewpoints, then we must unceremoniously give them severe and profound criticism, and there can be no concession in ideological struggle. If we make concessions, it is a crime against the people, and we abandon the important responsibilities that literary criticism should have. But I precisely made concessions to ideological struggle on the literary and art front.

    IV.

    The errors I made in the article "On the Correct Attitude of Criticism" are derived from the right-leaning literary criticism viewpoints pointed out above. Certain basic errors in thinking have been further expanded and developed in this article.

    For example, what I saw first was "incorrect criticism attitude." But what is the fact? For many years in the past, our literary criticism has not been too much, but too little. It needs the leadership to vigorously promote its development. This year, after the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and Xiao Yemu's works aroused discussion throughout the country, the strength of literary criticism has been greatly strengthened. Even so, it is still far from the actual need. These discussions are very important and very correct. They are major achievements we have gained in the ideological struggle on the literary and art front since the founding of the country. I did not give enough due estimate to this major thing, this important achievement. On the contrary, I exaggerated the other side, raising several incorrect trends in literary criticism that I subjectively believed to an absolute position. How serious is this ideological error!

    At that time, the discussion of Xiao Yemu's works was being carried out enthusiastically throughout the country. Although Li Dingzhong's letter published in "Literary Gazette" Issue 41 has some individual places where the arguments are somewhat biased, its basic arguments are completely correct. I ignored its main points and seized some unnecessary individual sentences, absolutizing them, and thinking that they were the primary incorrect attitude of criticism. In fact, the harmfulness of petty bourgeois thought in literature is not much lower than that of bourgeois thought. If bourgeois thought exists in works, it is still easy to be discovered. As for petty bourgeois thought, it is not the case. Many of our writers, and even readers, come from the petty bourgeoisie. Therefore, works with such ideological feelings are easily accepted and easily find their market. And on the other hand, we are not defensive enough against it. We always feel that compared with bourgeois thought, the harmfulness of the latter is smaller, which is undoubtedly wrong. In fact, at that time, the people who voiced the call for "excessive criticism" in the discussion of Xiao Yemu's works were also some petty bourgeois intellectuals. They held unprincipled sympathy, because they also wanted to preserve these remnants of ideological feelings. And what about myself? I felt that Li Dingzhong's criticism was inevitably "excessive," which also shows that my thoughts resonated with these people. The other more essential aspect is that I have an insufficient understanding of the harmfulness of petty bourgeois ideological feelings in creation, and I have an insufficient understanding of the corrosive effect of petty bourgeois ideological feelings on the working-class ideology, and of the importance of class struggle.

    There are these sentences in my article: "These critics replaced criticism with sticks. This is really as the saying goes: 'Once power is in hand, I'll call you to see the King of Hell.'" It also said: "What good will it do to continue doing this? They are not encouraging creation, but are acting as butchers and executioners." Who exactly are the so-called "they"? Has anyone really done this? The definite answer is no. Even if there are relatively biased sentences in individual critical articles, this has not become a trend. What exactly does the so-called "they are acting as butchers and executioners" mean? Is it to scare writers? Is it to call on writers and readers to encircle the critics? If you really want to encircle them, where is the target? Isn't this "shooting arrows without a target"? I created an illusion, and then treated this illusion as a real thing, pointing it out as an incorrect and serious trend. I was simply telling the readers and writers in general in a loud voice: Today, in our literary world, there is such a critic who is ruling over the heads of the writers, "replacing criticism with sticks" and "acting as a butcher and executioner," and wants you to "see the King of Hell." For this kind of person, you must "beat him like a rat crossing the street"!

    Although I did not explicitly declare that I would abolish criticism, I damaged the criticism career that was just developing, implying to everyone: Today's criticism circles have become a state of anarchy and chaos. There is no leadership from the Party. Even if such a serious and bad phenomenon occurs, no one will come out to correct and stop it. It completely negated the Party's leading role in literary criticism. Isn't this not the fact?

    I did not realize all these serious ideological errors at the time after I published this article. Even after others pointed it out, it did not attract my attention. It was not until many people said so, and the leadership talked to me directly, that I began to feel the seriousness of the matter! This shows how naive my ideological confusion and political backwardness have reached!

    V.

    Are these erroneous ideas of mine, manifested in the editing work and in literary criticism, formed accidentally? No! No! It has its deep-rooted ideological origins.

    I come from the petty bourgeoisie. Although I joined the Party, as Chairman Mao said: "There are many Party members who have joined the Party organizationally, but have not completely joined the Party ideologically, or even have not joined the Party at all. These people who have not completely joined the Party ideologically still have many dirty things of the exploiting classes in their minds. They simply do not know what is proletarian ideology, what is communism, and what is the Party." I am such a Party member! Although "I joined the Party organizationally, I have not completely joined the Party ideologically, or even have not joined the Party at all."

    I forgot that I am a Communist Party member, and I have no organizational concept. All actions and speeches are based on personal interests. I run publications without accepting leadership, write articles without showing them to the leadership, and do not humbly adopt the opinions of the masses. I act arbitrarily and irresponsibly publish my opinions to the outside world. What kind of Party member is this?

    As a Communist Party member, the most important condition is Party spirit. The specific manifestation of Party spirit is the organizational concept, and everything obeys the interests of the Party. But I just cannot do this. I am free and undisciplined, unwilling to accept the Party's leadership, and regard organization and discipline as a kind of "shackle." This is precisely the thought of anarchism, and has nothing in common with proletarian ideology. Lenin said:

    The proletariat is not afraid of organization and discipline... People who lack organization and disciplined self-education are not proletarians, but some intellectuals in our Party.

    Am I not precisely such an intellectual? So, for me, the most serious problem today is to "completely join the Party ideologically," that is, to completely eliminate the "dirty things of the exploiting classes still stored in my mind" and establish the proletarian stance and viewpoint. Only in this way can I avoid making repeated mistakes in the future, and only in this way can I firmly stand on the side of the working class in the literary criticism work and serve the masses well.

### 从“文学评论”编辑工作中检讨我的文艺批评思想

    从“文学评论”编辑工作中检讨我的文艺批评思想
    王淑明
    一
    “光明日报”的副刊“文学评论”，是我和几个朋友合办的。这刊物一开始，就具有同人的性质，是没有什么一定的方针和目的的。我们几个人偶尔谈起，觉得当时的文艺批评空气太沉寂，需要有一个刊物，来把它搅动一下，于是就向报馆方面接洽，办起来了。
    几个人中间，我是主编，对这刊物负主要责任，而又是一个共产党员，所以，这刊物办得不好，我要负重大的责任。
    我既然是一个党员，当时参加这刊物的编辑，是怎样想的呢？
    我的动机是不纯的。
    我到北京来参加文艺工作，觉得行政职务太小，“名不见重于当时”，比起其他许多同志来，实在是“相形见拙”，大有“冠盖满京华，斯人独憔悴”之感。觉得组织上既对我不信任，不另加青睐，就只有靠自己搞出名堂来。办刊物，就是自找出路的一法。
    当时我还有另外一种想法，那就是不将刊物放在“人民日报”上，而在其它党派的报纸上面办出，为什么这样呢？我觉得“人民日报”是党报，在这上面出刊，我们的文章，就要受到审查，这无疑是一种“束缚”，而这种“束缚”，我是不能忍受的。一向自负甚高的我，自己写文章，不愿被人修改，至于退回不用，更认为是莫大耻辱，如发生这类事情，我就和这个刊物断绝往来，我的狂妄无知，不知天地覆载之厚，是竟达到这样叫人不能相信的程度！
    在“光明日报”上附刊，我觉得有几种便利：一、不受审查。想说什么，就说什么，天地辽阔，可以放任而“自由”。二、既然是民主同盟办的报纸，党即使要来干涉或领导，亦有所不便，我是这样自绝于党。当一开始办这个刊物的时候，就与组织取着对立的态度，有意避免接受党的领导，把接受党的领导，认为是一种“干涉”和“束缚”。这那里有丝毫共产党员的气味！不但共产党员不该这样做，即使是进步的民主人士，我想也绝不会这样做的。党今天的政治威信，在群众中空前的提高，真正的进步民主人士，有许多人是自愿地要求接受党的指导的，而我，却反而不这样做。把一个党员的水平，降低到连进步的群众都不如。这是多么严重的危险！
    我以为自己搞文艺工作，行政职务很小，不免有“怀才不遇”之感，其实这是非常错误的。一个党员，只应老老实实地为工人阶级和人民服务，不当计及其它。而我却把个人利益，看得高于一切，为了个人，宁可使党的利益和党在群众中的影响和威信，受到损失而毫不知道可惜，这已失去了一个共产党员的起码品质了。和我在一起编“文学评论”的朋友，当时只有我是共产党员，我没有在其中起过党员的应有作用。如果他们中有人也有搞小名堂思想，不满意领导的思想，我当时不是去设法说服，引导他们放弃那个小圈子，接受正确的领导，而是相反，自己也有那种荒谬想法，甚至推波助澜，煽其成长。这难道是一个共产党员应该做的事情吗？我已堕落为政治上的庸人而不自知了。
    二
    离开了党的领导和指示，而来编文艺刊物，个人主义地乱闯、乱碰，既没有明确的方针和目标，又不愿决心对人民负责，只把它看成为同人性的小集团的东西。这个刊物的办到后来，终于犯了错误，走向失败，是无法避免的。
    这次文艺整风学习，丁玲同志在大会上的发言，指出““文学评论”的编辑态度不严肃”，我当时听了很不乐意，觉得对于这个刊物，自己很花了一番心血，不能说一点成绩都没有，怎能说它“态度不严肃”呢？后来苦苦思索，再把“文学评论”发表过的文章，前后看了一遍，觉得丁玲同志所指出的，是完全适当的。
    如果硬要说“编辑态度严肃”，那末，这种“严肃的态度”，在那里呢？前面说过：这个刊物，是没有明确的方针和目标的。记得当时我们也常常说：““文学评论”要具有战斗性。”但究竟是怎样的“战斗性”呢？向谁“战斗”呢？向封建阶级的文艺吗？向资产阶级和小资产阶级的文艺吗？今天仔细检查起来，我们都没有切实和这些坏作品，打过一次硬仗。对于“武训传”的讨论，我们很冷淡视之，对于萧也牧的作品，我们曾有两次登过近于捧场的文章，待批评开始后，我们自己没有作过检讨，更没有仔细地对于他的作品，作一次较深刻的研究，写出严肃的批评文章，来纠正在读者中还存在的错误印象，所有这些，你能说是“态度严肃”吗？事实很显然：一个文艺刊物，如果离开了党的领导和指示，没有和当前的政治任务相配合，自作聪明，以感想代替政策，那末，这个刊物的编辑，就只能成为政治上的盲人，这个刊物的进行，就不免迷失了方向。它将要像唐·吉诃德似地盲目乱碰，把风车当做巨人，自以为是了不起的英雄，其实没有做出一件像样的正经事来。事实也是如此，我们刊物批评的主要锋芒，一开始就不是向封建阶级，向资产阶级和小资产阶级的文艺思想作战，而是找一些在新文艺创作上具有显著成绩的作家，如赵树理、丁玲同志……等，在他们头上开起火来，预备把这些人打下去，好一显自己的身手，这完全是盲目乱干，不分敌我，小资产阶级的极端个人主义思想的表现。
    其次，我们也常说：“刊物要有群众性。”有人曾以此自豪，觉得这是“文学评论”的特点。其实所谓“刊物要有群众性”，就这句话本身看来，涵义亦不明确。我们所说的“群众”，究竟指的是什么样的“群众”呢？工农兵呢？还是小市民呢？或者是在这二者之外呢？如果不分皂白，把小市民的嗜好和趣味，作为迎合和迁就的对象，那就糟了。我们对于来自群众中的意见，没有很好地加以研究和分析，区别其中何者为正确的，何者为不正确的。我们之中，有人只要听到了誉扬就踌躇满志，以为刊物真的做到有“群众性”了。其实这是盲目的自信。现在仔细考虑起来，有许多读者的意见，是不完全正确的，甚至是错误的，我们都没有加以分别，全盘接受下来，这是非常要不得的。
    还有，我们在处理稿件上，是不负责任的。“文学评论”上发表的绝大多数文章，是经我看过的。作为一个主要负责编辑人来说，我是怎样来对待这些稿件的呢？有许多来稿，其内容所批评的作品对象，我是没有重新看过的，仅凭粗浅的不可靠的记忆，以为大概如批评者所指出的那样，就把它发表了。这是何等不严肃的编辑态度！
    正因为我的编辑态度不严肃，所以出乱子就很多，例如“黄河坝上”这篇小说，内容虽有缺点，但却绝不如读者紫兮所说的那么严重，那样一无是处！我没有予以考虑，就将它发表了。那文章的批评内容，将作品中的有些缺点，过于夸大，而优点完全没有指出。如果我当时把原作再仔细读一下，就可能发现这批评的不公允处，然而我却没有这样做。
    又如杨树先的“对两个问题的意见”一文（见“文学评论”二十三期），批评了“麦克阿瑟的时间表”和“美国流氓们，你们听着！”两诗，但他的引文，把原诗的上下句断章取义地割裂开来，仅拣其中便利于自己论证的地方，予以节录，以致单看引文，似乎颇有道理，如果将全诗联系起来读，那就看出作者立论，有许多是牵强附会，不能自圆其说的。像这样的断章取义式的文章，我也把它原封不动地发表了。
    所有以上这一切，都说明我们的编辑态度，是非常轻率，丝毫没有对人民负责的态度的。丁玲同志对于“文学评论”的批评，还能说是过分吗？
    三
    我自己的许多文章，是发表在“文学评论”上的。正如同我的编辑态度不严肃一样，我的写作态度也是不严肃的，刊物是自己办的，文章有发表的便利。而我从来又自高自大，文章不轻易愿人家改动，不接受领导，不肯虚心采纳别人意见，更基本的是缺乏对人民负责的态度，所以我的文章里，有些论点发生错误。其中观点最荒谬的，是用裘祖英的笔名发表的“论正确的批评态度”一文（“文学评论”第三十七期）。
    在未分析这篇文章的内容错误以前，先说一说我的文艺批评思想。
    文艺批评的作用，当然在于指导创作，但我以为要进行批评，首先要有创作。目前的文艺界，不但创作水平不高，而且产量亦不丰。这原因虽有多方面，但不少作家，感到文艺批评的严厉空气，不敢动笔，怕亦是其中原因之一。我觉得有个别同志的批评文章，的确有些过于“严厉”，就把它和目前创作界的萎靡不振现象，联系起来，认为批评应该“持平”，不宜“过火”，免得弄到妨害创作的发展。实际上我的这种所谓“持平”，“不宜过火”论，就是文艺批评上的右倾思想。
    我又觉得文艺界的统一战线方面，也应当照顾，对于那些老作家，中间作家的作品，批评时应该是多鼓励，少指摘，发扬其优点，不要过分揭露其缺点。你看！他们中间的许多人，不是已在那里对于文艺批评，大叫其苦吗？
    在我的批评思想里，缺乏一个最基本的东西，这就是胡乔木同志所指出的：在文艺战线上，确立工人阶级的思想领导，我的许多看法的错误，都是从这样的一个基本思想没有确立的根源出发的。
    我觉得创作产量要丰，但不知除了量多之外，更重要的还要质好。文艺是教育人民的工具，如果创作界发现了大批思想内容恶劣的作品，而任其流传，对于人民的作用，将不是有利而是有害的。像这样的作品，就需要毫不容情地对它进行严正的批评，才能既教育了人民，也教育了作家本身，才能使文艺创作得到正常的发展。
    我仅看到有些作家，对于文艺批评感到不满，大叫其苦，却没有仔细考察一下，这些嗡嗡的声音，是从那里发出的，而就毫不加思虑地对它相信和完全同情起来。事实上，这是一些小资产阶级出身的作家，或个别具有反动的资产阶级思想的作家，他们自身既不接近工农兵，又不愿进行思想改造，宁肯在其灵魂深处，保存着小资产阶级或资产阶级的思想王国，就是这些人慨叹于批评的“过火”。而我毫不觉察，支持了这种十分错误的叫嚣，既然我的文艺批评观点，是“持平”，那末，我所反对的，当然也是“过火”，和这些人的思想，在基本上是一鼻孔出气的。我无形中助长了他们的气焰，为之张目，降低了正确的文艺批评的威信，站在非无产阶级的思想意识一边，放弃了阶级斗争，对敌人抱同情，做了错误的甚至反动叫嚣的尾巴。
    我没有知道，对于这些人来说，他们从各个角落发出相同的批评“过火”的声音，乃是理所当然。这些人之所以喋喋不休，其本意就在于拒绝和不要批评，以这作为挡箭牌，企图达到其保存自己小资产阶级资产阶级的思想王国的目的。如果他们既要创作，而又不愿放弃其原来的小资产阶级的思想感情，甚至是反动的资产阶级的思想观点，那我们就要毫不客气地予以严厉而深刻的批评，对于思想斗争是丝毫不能让步的。如让了步，就是对人民犯罪，放弃了文艺批评应有的重大职责。但我恰恰就是在文艺战线上对思想斗争让了步。
    四
    我在“论正确的批评态度”一文中犯的错误，是导源于上面所指出的右倾的文艺批评观点而来的。某些基本错误思想，在这篇文章里，是更加扩大和发展了。
    例如我首先看到的是“不正确的批评态度”，事实上怎样呢？过去多少年来，我们的文艺批评，不是太多而患太少，需要领导方面大力地推动其发展。这一年中，经过电影“武训传”和萧也牧的作品在全国范围内引起讨论后，文艺批评的力量是大大地加强了。就是这样，距离实际的需要也还远。这些讨论，都是非常重要的，十分正确的，是我们开国以来在文艺战线的思想斗争上所获得的重大成绩。对于这种重大的事情，这样重要的成绩，我没有予以足够的正当估计。而相反地，却夸大其另一面，把在主观上认为几种不正确的文艺批评倾向，抬高到绝对化的地位。这是如何严重的思想错误！
    当时对于萧也牧作品的讨论，正在全国范围内热烈展开。“文艺报”四十一期上发表的李定中的信，虽说其中个别地方，立论不无偏激之处，但其基本论点是完全正确的。我看落了其主要论点而抓住了其中一些非必要的个别语句，将其绝对化起来，认为是首要的不正确的批评态度。其实文艺上小资产阶级思想的危害性，并不比资产阶级思想，低到多少。资产阶级思想，如果存在于作品中，还容易被人发觉，至于小资产阶级的思想就不然，我们的作家，甚至读者，很多是出身于小资产阶级的。因而具有这样的思想感情的作品，就很容易被人所接受，很容易找到其市场。而在另一面，我们对于它的防范性也不够，总觉得比起资产阶级思想来，后者的危害程度要小些，这无疑是错误的。事实上当时对于萧也牧作品的讨论，发出“批评过火”这种呼声的人，也正是一些小资产阶级知识分子，他们抱着无原则的同情，因为自己也想保存这些思想感情的残渣。而我自己呢？觉得李定中的批评，不免“过火”，这也正表明我的思想，和这些人有共鸣之处。其另外更本质的一面，是我对小资产阶级思想感情在创作上的危害性，认识不足。对小资产阶级思想感情给予工人阶级思想的腐蚀作用，对于阶级斗争的重要性也认识不够。
    在我的文章里有这样的几句话：“这些批评家们，把棍棒代替了批评。这真如俗话所说的：‘一朝权在手，叫你见阎君。’”又说：“这样做下去究竟有什么好处呢？他们不是在鼓励创作，而是在做着屠夫和刽子手。”所谓“他们”，究竟是些什么人呢？曾经有人真的这么做过吗？可以肯定的回答，是没有的。即使个别的批评文章中，有比较偏激的语句，但这也并没有成为一种倾向，所谓“他们是在做着屠夫和刽子手”，究竟是什么意思呢？是想吓唬作家吗？是想号召作家和读者，都起来向批评家们围攻吗？真的起来围攻的话，对象又在那里？这不是“无的放矢”吗？我心造了幻像，又把这幻像像煞有介事地当做箭垛，作为一种不正确的严重倾向来指出。我简直在大声告诉读者，告诉一般作家：今天我们文坛上，有这样一种批评家，他君临于作家们的头上，“以棍棒代替批评”，“做着屠夫和刽子手”，而要你们去“见阎君”。对于这种人，你们要“老鼠过街，人人喊打”呀！
    我虽没有明白宣告要取消批评，但却予刚在发展过程中的批评事业以损害，暗示了大家：今天的批评界，是成为一种无政府的混乱状态，没有党的领导，即使发生了这样严重的恶劣现象，亦没有人出来加以纠正和阻止。把党在文艺批评上的领导作用，完全否定了。这难道不是事实吗？
    所有这些严重的思想错误，我在当时发表了这篇文章之后，竟丝毫没有觉察到，经过别人指出后，也未能引起我的注意。直到许多人都这样说，领导方面也直接和我谈起，我才开始感到事情的严重！这说明我思想的昏庸，和政治上的落后，是达到如何幼稚的程度！

    我的这些错误思想，表现于编辑工作中的，于文艺批评上面的，难道是偶然形成的吗？不！不是的！是有其根深柢固的思想根源的。
    我出身于小资产阶级，虽然入了党，但正如毛主席所说的：“有许多党员，在组织上入了党，思想上并没有完全入党，甚至完全没有入党。这种思想上完全没有入党的人，头脑里还装着许多剥削阶级的脏东西，根本不知道什么是无产阶级思想，什么是共产主义，什么是党。”我就是这样的一种党员！虽然“在组织上入了党，思想上并没有完全入党，甚至完全没有入党”。
    我忘记了自己是一个共产党员，没有组织观念。所有行动和言论，都从个人利益出发，办刊物，不接受领导，写文章，不给领导上看，也不虚心采纳群众的意见，自作主张，不负责任地随便对外发表言论。这算是什么党员呢？
    作为一个共产党员，首先最重要的条件，是党性，党性的具体表现，就是组织观念，一切服从党的利益。而我就恰恰不能这样，自由散漫，不愿接受党的领导，把组织和纪律，当做一种“束缚”，这正是无政府主义式的思想，和无产阶级思想，毫无相同之处。列宁说：
    无产阶级不害怕组织和纪律……缺少组织和纪律的自我教育的人，不是无产阶级，而是我们党内的某些知识分子。
    我正是这样的一种知识分子，还不十分明白吗？所以在我来说，今天最严重的问题是要在“思想上完全入党”，也就是说，把“头脑里还装着许多剥削阶级的脏东西”，完全消除掉，确立无产阶级的立场和观点。只有这样，今后才可以避免发生重复的错误，也只有这样，在文艺批评工作上，才能坚定地站在工人阶级的立场上，为人民大众很好地服务。
