To the Editor:

    Tianjin is currently carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. The Tianjin Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee has specially established a "Mass Reception Group" to receive reports and confessions from people from all walks of life regarding all forms of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Establishing this organization is absolutely necessary because the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign must have the support of the broad masses of the people in order to be thoroughly and deeply implemented.

    I suggest that government agencies in various localities establish similar organizations as much as possible to encourage people from all walks of life to report all instances of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and to enable those who have taken or offered bribes to confess, and to jointly fight for the complete elimination of theft and waste of state property.

    在反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动中
    应该推广“群众接待组”的经验
    编辑同志：天津市正在开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。天津市节约检查委员会特别设立了一个“群众接待组”，接受各界人民对一切贪污、浪费和官僚主义的检举和坦白。建立这个组织是完全有必要的。因为反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动，一定要得到广大人民的支持，才能深入、彻底地贯彻下去。
    我建议各地政府机关，尽可能成立类似的组织，推动各界人民，检举一切贪污、浪费和官僚主义，并使受贿或行贿者进行坦白，共同为彻底消灭盗窃，浪费国家财产的现象而斗争。    吴晴
