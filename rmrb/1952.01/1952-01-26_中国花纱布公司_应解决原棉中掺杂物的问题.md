    China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation
    Should Solve the Problem of Impurities in Raw Cotton

    To the Editor: Our state-owned Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory uses raw cotton from the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, which often contains impurities such as iron wire ends, iron pieces, oily cotton, seed cotton, and cotton seeds. This phenomenon is even more serious in new cotton bales. We can pick out seven or eight pounds of impurities every day. More seriously, each bale of raw cotton contains a large amount of seed cotton bolls and cotton seeds, and the scutching room alone can pick out more than thirty pounds every day. If seed cotton bolls and cotton seeds enter the machine, they will be pressed into seed cakes and mixed into the cotton laps. This will inevitably reduce the life of the card clothing, increase the end breakage rate, and cause unevenness in the yarn sliver. The yarn spun and the cloth woven in this way are of very poor quality. Therefore, we suggest that the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation find a way to solve the problem of impurities in raw cotton.

    中国花纱布公司
    应解决原棉中掺杂物的问题
    编辑同志：我们国营天津第四棉纺织厂使用中国花纱布公司的原棉，其中经常有铁丝头、铁片、油棉、籽棉、棉籽等杂物。特别是在新棉包中，这种现象更为严重。我们每天可以拣出七、八磅杂物。更严重的是每包原棉中，都有大量的籽棉瓣和棉籽，只清花间每日即可拣出三十多磅。如果籽棉瓣和棉籽进到机器里，会被压成籽饼，混成棉卷。这必然减少梳棉机针布的寿命，增加断头率和纱条不匀的现象。这样纺成的纱和织成的布，质量很不好。因此，我们建议中国花纱布公司设法解决原棉中含有杂物的问题。　　张力溥　李富有
