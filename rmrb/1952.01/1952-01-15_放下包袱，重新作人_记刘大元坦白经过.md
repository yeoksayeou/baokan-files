    Lay Down the Burden and Start Anew
    —A Record of Liu Dayuan's Confession

Liu Dayuan was an engineer in the Communications Bureau of the Chahar Provincial People's Government. In April 1949, he, along with Pei Shiyi, the chief engineer of the Provincial Communications Bureau, and others, conspired to embezzle more than 100,000 jin of millet during the construction of the Xuanhua-Yuxian Dadu River Bridge project. Liu Dayuan himself received赃物 equivalent to more than 25 million yuan. At the beginning of this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, Liu Dayuan voluntarily confessed all his embezzlement to the leadership. He also made a confession and self-criticism at a conference of nearly 2,000 people convened by the Provincial Savings Inspection Committee. Zhang Su, director of the Provincial Savings Inspection Committee, believed that his confession was sincere and thorough, and that he could be given a reduced sentence or a suspended sentence, allowing him to continue working and atone for his crimes.

Liu Dayuan is a retained personnel, 25 years old this year, and from Yangyuan County, Chahar Province. When he worked in the Japanese puppet and Kuomintang government agencies, due to the influence of the bad atmosphere, he used his power to deliberately find fault with the workers and extort them. After Liu Dayuan joined the revolutionary ranks with the corrupt thoughts and style of the Kuomintang, he encountered the construction of the Xuanhua-Yuxian Highway Dadu River Bridge project for the first time and embezzled a large sum from it.

Half a year after starting work, Liu Dayuan was educated by the Communist Party and the People's Government. Seeing that the veteran cadres were working conscientiously and responsibly, living frugally, and doing everything for the people, he began to realize the essential difference between the Kuomintang reactionary government and the People's Government, and realized that his embezzlement was despicable and shameful. Soon, he participated in the restoration project of the Pangjiabao Mine, and there were many vivid examples that stimulated him. In the past, he saw Kuomintang receiving personnel steal and sell the machines, putting them into their private pockets; now, the Communist Party cadres cherish the state's property as their own lives, truly returning every bit to the public, with a clear conscience. The workers' enthusiasm for protecting state property moved him even more. He saw the workers find eighteen very valuable octagonal steels. He thought they would steal them and sell them as they did in the Kuomintang era. But unexpectedly, the workers handed them all in. At night, when it rained, the workers voluntarily got up and rushed more than a thousand bags of cement on the ground into the house. He thought to himself: society has changed, the workers have also changed, but he himself has not changed. The workers are models of actively working and protecting state property, but he himself is a criminal who steals state property. Liu Dayuan's ideological burden has become heavier and heavier since then.

Last year, with the development of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, he saw that China, which had been bullied by imperialism for more than a hundred years, had actually defeated the invasion of American imperialism. The new China had just been born for more than two years, and various construction undertakings were advancing by leaps and bounds. His long-held idea that "China is backward, China has no way out" was fundamentally shaken. He felt excited, but this excitement deepened his pain. He thought: the new China is so lovable, but he himself is a sinner of the new China. When the donation movement was launched, in order to relieve the guilt of his conscience, he raised 7.8 million yuan and donated it to the Beijing Qianmenwai People's Bank Office in two installments to buy airplanes and cannons. He wanted to return the embezzled money to the people so that he could eliminate the pressure on his conscience, and he also wanted to atone for his sins by working hard. However, the ideological burden weighed heavily on him, his diet was poor, his sleep was disturbed, and he dared not approach the leading cadres and party members. For more than a year, he had not done his job well, his body was thin, and his appearance was also old. When others asked him if he was sick? He had to say "not feeling well." He had discussed with Pei Shiyi, the main culprit of the embezzlement, several times, wanting to confess. But Pei stopped him and said, "I embezzled a lot in the past, what does this little bit count? If you tell, you will either die or be sentenced to life imprisonment." Liu Dayuan was not sure about the government's policy, so he did not dare to confess.

Last year, Liu Dayuan participated in the construction of the Xiahuayuan Yanghe Bridge project again. One night, the river water washed away the dam, and the wood was about to be washed away. The workers braved the rain and the biting cold wind to rush to plug the gap. The workers' selfless enthusiasm stimulated him once again. He came back from the construction site and watched the movie "Steel Warrior". When he saw Zhang Zhijian's loyal and unyielding scene in order to protect the national wealth, he couldn't help but shed tears. He was so ashamed that he didn't have the courage to look up. On the way home, he decided to confess his crimes to the leadership. When he got home, he immediately wrote a confession letter, and he took it out to leave. Halfway through, he saw the execution ground for counter-revolutionary criminals on the eastern hillside from afar. His thoughts fluctuated again, and he said to himself, isn't this automatically walking to the execution ground? The faces of his father, mother, wife, and children appeared one by one. He thought, what will happen to my parents' lives if I die? Who will take care of my wife and children? He turned back with the confession letter.

When the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began, a fierce struggle unfolded in Liu Dayuan's mind. Should he lay down the burden and work for the people again? Or should he carry the burden and suffer to death, and finally be spurned by the people? He was restless. He had carefully read all the news about anti-corruption and waste in the newspapers. When he saw the policy of "those who confess voluntarily will have their crimes reduced if they are serious, and exempted if they are minor...", he mustered the courage to confess. He thought that if he confessed thoroughly, the government would give him lenient treatment, and he would still have a chance to start anew. After listening to Sun Jingwen, secretary of the Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, give a mobilization report on anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, he made up his mind to take the first path. The next day, he handed over the confession and self-examination letter, which he had written and kept for three months, to the leadership of the Communications Bureau. In the letter, he confessed all his crimes. His spirit of confession was encouraged by the leadership, allowing him to atone for his crimes by doing meritorious service.

    放下包袱，重新作人
    ——记刘大元坦白经过
    新华社记者　杨兴华
    刘大元是察哈尔省人民政府交通局工程员。一九四九年四月，他和省府交通局总工程师裴士毅等在修建宣（化）蔚（县）大渡口桥工程中同谋贪污小米十多万斤。刘大元自己分得赃物约合两千五百多万元。这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始时，刘大元自动向领导方面坦白了全部贪污事实。并在省节约检查委员会召开的近两千人的大会上进行了坦白检讨。省节约检查委员会主任张苏认为他坦白得诚恳彻底，可以减刑和缓刑，让他继续工作，戴罪立功。
    刘大元是留用人员，今年二十五岁，察哈尔省阳原县人。他在日伪和国民党政府机关中工作时，由于恶劣风气的熏染，曾利用职权故意挑工人的毛病，敲诈工人。刘大元带着国民党腐败的思想作风参加革命阵营后，第一次遇到修建宣蔚公路大渡口桥工程，就从中大大贪污了一把。
    参加工作半年后，刘大元受到共产党和人民政府的教育，看到老干部工作认真负责，生活刻苦，一切都为人民打算，开始认识到国民党反动政府和人民政府本质的区别，认识到自己贪污的卑鄙可耻。不久，他参加庞家堡矿厂的恢复工程，又有许多活生生的事例刺激他。从前，他看见国民党接收人员把机器盗卖了，装了私人的腰包；现在共产党的干部珍惜国家的财产如同自己的生命，真是点滴归公，一清二白。工人们爱护国家财产的热情更使他感动。他看见工人们找到十八根很贵重的八楞钢，他以为他们会像在国民党时代那样偷着卖掉。但出乎意料之外，工人们全数交了上去。夜间下雨，工人们自动起来把地上的一千多袋洋灰抢到屋里去。他想着：社会变了，工人也变了，惟有自己还没有变。工人是积极工作爱护国家财产的模范，自己却是盗窃国家财产的罪犯。刘大元的思想负担从此越来越重。
    去年，随着抗美援朝运动的开展，他看到百多年来受帝国主义欺负的中国居然打垮了美国帝国主义的侵略。新中国刚刚诞生二年多，各种建设事业突飞猛进。他一贯认为“中国落后，中国没办法”的思想发生了根本动摇，他感到兴奋，但这种兴奋又加深了他的苦痛。他想：新中国这样可爱，自己却是新中国的罪人。捐献运动展开时，他为了解除自己良心的责罚，就筹了七百八十万元分两次到北京前门外人民银行办事处捐献飞机大炮。他想把贪污的钱交还人民，就可以消除自己良心上的压力，他并想以努力工作来赎罪。但是思想包袱沉重地压着他，饮食不振，睡眠不安，在领导干部和党员面前闪闪躲躲不敢接近，一年多以来，工作没做好，身体消瘦，面貌也苍老了。别人问他是不是有病？他只好说“身体不好”。他曾几次和贪污主犯裴士毅商量，想要坦白。裴却制止他说：“过去我贪污多了，这点算什么？说了不死也得判处无期徒刑。”刘大元摸不清政府的政策，就没敢坦白。
    去年修建下花园洋河大桥的工程，刘大元又参加了。一天夜晚，河水冲坏了坝，木料眼看就要被冲走。工人冒着雨和刺骨的寒风抢堵缺口。工人的忘我热情又一次刺激着他。他从工地回来看了电影“钢铁战士”，当看到张志坚为了保护国家财富忠贞不屈的情景时，不禁流下了眼泪。他惭愧得再也没有勇气抬起头看下去。在回家的路上，他决心要向领导方面坦白自己的罪行。到家立即写了一封坦白书，他带上就往外走。走到半路遥遥望见东山坡枪毙反革命罪犯的刑场，他思想又动摇起来，自言自语地说，这不是自动往刑场上走吗？父、母、妻、子的面貌一一在眼前出现。他想我死了父母的生活怎么办？老婆孩子由谁来照管？他带着坦白书又折了回来。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始，刘大元脑子里展开了激烈斗争，究竟是放下包袱重新为人民工作呢？还是背着包袱痛苦至死，最后为人民所唾弃呢？他坐卧不安，报纸上关于反贪污浪费的消息他都很仔细地看过，当他看到“自动坦白者，重者减罪，轻者免罪……”的政策时，他鼓起了坦白的勇气，他想他彻底坦白，政府会宽大处理，还有重新作人的机会。当他听了中共张家口市委员会书记孙敬文关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的动员报告后，便下定决心走第一条道路。第二天他就把早已写好装了三个月的坦白反省书交给了交通局的领导方面。信上他坦白了他的全部罪行。他这种坦白精神受到领导方面的鼓励，允许他戴罪立功。
