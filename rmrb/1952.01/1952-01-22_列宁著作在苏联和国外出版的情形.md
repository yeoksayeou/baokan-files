    Soviet Union  Shavitzkaya
    Twenty-eight years ago, in the days of mourning in January 1924, the Second All-Union Congress of Soviets passed a special resolution on the publication and wide dissemination of the brilliant works of Lenin, the leader of the international proletariat. The resolution pointed out that the best way to commemorate Lenin was to widely disseminate Lenin's works and turn communist ideas into the property of all working people.

    The Second All-Union Congress of Soviets entrusted the Lenin Institute to take the most urgent measures to publish millions of copies of Lenin's selected works in various languages, especially in various Oriental languages, and to first print works of particular importance to the broad masses of workers and peasants. At the same time, the Lenin Institute was also entrusted with the task of publishing Lenin's Complete Works rapidly and in a strictly scientific spirit.

    Lenin's works have spread to every corner of the globe. Communist ideas have become the property of millions of working people.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and Comrade Stalin himself paid great attention to the publication and dissemination of Lenin's works. In order to collect, preserve, and scientifically publish Lenin's works, a special scientific research institution, the Lenin Institute, was established in 1923, affiliated to the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). This institute was later merged with the Marx and Engels Institute in 1931 to become the unified Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute, affiliated to the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Since then, the work of publishing Lenin's works in Russian and other Soviet national languages within the Soviet Union has been undertaken by the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute and its branches in the various Union Republics.

    According to official statistics, the total number of Lenin's works published in the Soviet Union since the establishment of the Soviet regime is 222,360,000 copies. These books were printed in seventy-seven languages: fifty-seven languages of various nationalities of the Soviet Union and twenty foreign languages.

    The publication of the fourth edition of Lenin's Complete Works is an outstanding event in the ideological life of the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet people, and the international proletariat. Its Russian edition was completed at the end of 1950. This version is the most complete collection of Lenin's literary heritage. Compared with the second and third editions, this version has added 501 new documents, of which 62 are published for the first time.

    In the fourth edition of the Complete Works, the documents that mark the great ideological cooperation between Lenin and Stalin are published in the most complete way.

    More than 500,000 copies of the new edition of the Complete Works have been printed. However, this huge print run is still not enough, and another 100,000 copies are now being printed.

    The fourth edition of Lenin's Complete Works has been translated from Russian into Belarusian and Latvian, and is now being published in Ukrainian, Azerbaijani, Georgian, Armenian, Uzbek, Kazakh, Lithuanian, and Estonian.

    Separate editions of Lenin's works have been published many times in the Soviet Union, with print runs of several million copies. "What Is To Be Done?", which clarifies the ideological foundation of the Marxist party, has been published in 108 editions in 34 languages, with a total print run of 4,688,000 copies. "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back," which explains the organizational principles of the Party, has been published in 81 editions in 29 languages, with a total print run of 4,130,000 copies.

"Left-Wing" Communism: an Infantile Disorder" has been printed in 92 editions in 33 languages, with a total print run of 3,016,000 copies.

    In the Soviet Union, Lenin's brilliant works serve as the ideological and theoretical armament of cadres and the communist education of workers. These works point the way to the construction of a communist society.

    Abroad, Lenin's works have been published and disseminated in more than 40 languages, with print runs of several million copies. The number of Lenin's works published in the People's Democracies of Central and Southeast Europe, the German Democratic Republic, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is particularly large.

    In Poland, according to incomplete statistics, the total number of Lenin's works published since 1945 is about 4 million copies; in Romania, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, it is about 2 million copies each; and in Bulgaria, it is more than 1.5 million copies.

During this period, more than 30 editions of essay collections were published in Italy and Japan, and about 20 editions were published in France. Separate editions of Lenin's works have also been published in the United Kingdom, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, Portugal, Spain, Greece, India, and other countries in Europe and Asia, Australia, Africa, the United States, and Latin America.

    列宁著作在苏联和国外出版的情形
    苏联  沙维茨卡娅
    二十八年前，在一九二四年一月的哀悼的日子里，第二次全苏联苏维埃代表大会通过了一个关于出版和广泛传播国际无产阶级领袖列宁的天才著作的专门决议。这个决议指出，广泛传播列宁的著作，使共产主义思想变成所有劳动人民的财产，就是纪念列宁的最好的办法。
    第二次全苏联苏维埃代表大会委托列宁学院采取最紧急的办法，用各种文字尤其是东方各种文字出版几百万册列宁选集，并首先印行对于广大工农阶层具有特殊重要意义的著作。同时，列宁学院也被委托用严格的科学精神，迅速出版列宁全集。
    列宁的著作已经传播到地球的每一个角落里。共产主义的思想已经成了几百万劳动群众的财产。
    苏联共产党、苏联政府和斯大林同志本人，对于列宁著作的出版和传播给了极大的注意。为了搜集、保存和合乎科学地发表列宁的著作，一九二三年设立了一个专门的科学研究机关——列宁学院，附设于联共（布）中央委员会之下。这个学院后来在一九三一年与马克思和恩格斯学院合并，成为统
    一的马克思—恩格斯—列宁学院，附设于联共（布）中央委员会之下。从此苏联境内用俄文及苏联其他民族文字出版列宁著作的工作，即由马克思—恩格斯—列宁学院及其在各加盟共和国的分院来担任。
    根据正式的统计，苏维埃政权成立以来苏联境内列宁著作的出版总量共为二亿二千二百三十六万册。这些书用七十七种文字印行：五十七种苏联各民族的文字和二十种外国文字。
    列宁全集第四版的出版，是布尔什维克党、苏联人民和国际无产阶级思想生活中的一件突出的大事：它的俄文版于一九五○年年底出齐。这个版本是列宁文字遗产的最完全的集子。这个版本和第二版及第三版相比，增加了五百零一篇新的文献，其中六十二篇是初次发表的。
    在全集第四版中，最完全的发表了标志着列宁和斯大林的伟大思想合作的文献。
    新版全集共印五十万部以上。但是这个庞大的印数还是不够的，现在又增印十万部。
    列宁全集第四版已由俄文译成白俄罗斯文和拉脱维亚文，现正用乌克兰、阿塞拜疆、乔治亚、亚美尼亚、乌兹贝克、哈萨克、立陶宛和爱沙尼亚等民族的文字出版。
    列宁著作的单行本多次在苏联出版，印数都有几百万册。阐明马克思主义政党思想基础的“做什么？”一书，用三十四种文字出了一百零八版，总印数为四百六十八万八千册。说明党的组织原则的“进一步，退两步”一书用二十九种文字出版了八十一版，共印四百十三万册。阐明党的策略基础的“社会民主党在民主革命中的两个策略”一书曾用三十六种文字印了一百零三版，总印数为四百二十一万三千册。
    列宁阐明马克思主义政党的理论基础的一本书——“唯物论与经验批判论”，曾用十七种文字印了七十三版，总印数为三百八十六万二千册。列宁的经典著作“帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段”用四十种文字印了一百六十一版，总印数为五百八十六万五千册。列宁的“国家与革命”用三十六种文字印了一百四十八版，总印数为五百十二万册。“苏维埃政权的当前任务”一书用三十一种文字印行七十版，总印数为二百十八万二千册。“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”用三十三种文字印了九十二版，总印数为三百零一万六千册。
    在苏联，列宁的天才著作为干部的思想—理论武装和劳动者的共产主义教育事业服务。这些著作指示共产主义社会建设的道路。
    在外国，列宁的著作用四十多种文字出版和传播，印数有几百万册。在中欧和东南欧人民民主国家里，在德意志民主共和国、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，列宁著作的出版数量尤为庞大。
    在波兰，根据不完全的统计，一九四五年以后出版的列宁著作的总印数是四百万册左右，在罗马尼亚、匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克是各二百万册左右，在保加利亚是一百五十万册以上。在阿尔巴尼亚，列宁著作的单行本的印数是四万多册。过去阿尔巴尼亚是没有一本书有过这样大的印数的。
    在波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚，列宁全集俄文本第四版的译本正在陆续出版。
    在德意志民主共和国，德国统一社会党也通过了一个关于出版列宁全集德文本的决议。选集已出版了二十万册。此外还出版了列宁的一些主要著作和文集的单行本。有些书的印数超过三十万册。
    在中华人民共和国，已经出版六卷集和两卷集的文选，并出版二十卷集的文选。很多列宁著作的单行本，以及列宁和斯大林关于社会主义经济建设、苏维埃民主、社会主义竞赛等问题的论文集也已出版。
    在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，正在出版和广泛传播列宁的著作。出版了两卷集和二十卷集的选集。出版了“列宁和斯大林论战争、起义与和平”、“列宁和斯大林论合作制”等的论文集。
    在各资本主义国家，虽然马克思主义的理论受到了迫害，而劳动人民却在出版和研究列宁的著作。第二次世界大战结束以后，奥地利、比利时、荷兰、丹麦，都已出版了列宁选集。在这个时期，意大利和日本出版了三十多版论文集，法国出版了二十版左右。在英国、挪威、芬兰、瑞典、瑞士、葡萄牙、西班牙、希腊、印度，以及欧洲和亚洲的其他各国，澳洲、非洲、美国和拉丁美洲各国，也出版了列宁的单行本著作。印度出版的列宁著作除了英文版的以外，更有印度各民族——乌尔都、德鲁古等文字的版本。
    列宁的经典著作“帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段”、“国家与革命”、“无产阶级革命与叛徒考茨基”、“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”等书，在国外获得最广泛的传播。
    全世界劳动者都在研究列宁的著作，研究马克思—列宁主义经典作者的著作，他们正从这些著作里面吸取他们从事争取和平、民主、社会主义斗争的力量和信心。
