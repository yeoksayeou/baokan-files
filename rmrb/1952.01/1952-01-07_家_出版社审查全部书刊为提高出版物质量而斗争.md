    “Jia” Publishing House Reviews All Books and Periodicals, Striving to Improve Publication Quality

    Editor: Since its establishment, our publishing house has published a total of 72 books and 70 issues of the journal "Jia" magazine. Half of the books were published before liberation, and 42 issues of "Jia" magazine were also published before liberation. Recently, Chairman Mao issued a call to the people of the whole country for ideological remolding, and the Central People's Government Publishing Administration also issued a call to "improve the quality of publications." We, as publishing workers, bear the important responsibility of providing readers with healthy spiritual food. We feel that many of the books and periodicals we published before liberation were influenced by capitalist ideology; some of the books published after liberation also have problematic viewpoints or are not serious enough in their attitude. In order to do a good job in publishing and to seek our own transformation, we are determined to conduct a more comprehensive review of the books and periodicals we have published.

    After review, we have decided to: stop selling 31 books with bad content and issues 1 to 42 of "Jia" magazine; not reprint 12 books of poor quality or outdated content after they are sold out; and revise the content of 13 books before reprinting them after the current edition is sold out.

    We made the above decision after many criticisms and self-criticisms, as well as intense ideological struggle. Of course, if this decision is viewed from a purely economic point of view, it represents a not insignificant loss for us. However, we feel that as publishing workers of the new China, we should abandon purely economic considerations and prioritize the interests of readers and the state. We are determined to unhesitatingly eliminate books and periodicals of poor quality.

    The results of this initial review of books and periodicals may not be entirely appropriate or thorough; however, it is enough to show our determination to do a good job in publishing in the future. We are determined to earnestly do a good job in publishing.

                                    Jia Publishing House

### “家”出版社审查全部书刊为提高出版物质量而斗争

    “家”出版社审查全部书刊为提高出版物质量而斗争
    编辑同志：本社创办以来，共出版书籍七十二种、期刊“家”杂志七十期。其中有一半书籍是在解放以前出版的，有四十二期的“家”杂志也是在解放以前出版的。最近毛主席向全国人民发出思想改造的号召，中央人民政府出版总署也发出“提高出版物的质量”的号召，我们身为出版工作者，负有供给读者健全的精神食粮的重任。我们觉得我们在解放以前所出的书刊，有很多是受资本主义思想影响的；在解放以后所出的书籍，也有一部分是观点有问题或态度不够认真的。我们为了做好出版工作，并为求自己的改造，决心对我们已出版的书刊，来一次比较全面的审查。
    经审查，我们决定：把三十一种内容不好的书籍和第一期到第四十二期“家”杂志停止发售；十二种质量不高或过时的书籍售完以后不再重版；十三种书籍待本版售完，修正其内容后再重版。
    我们作出上述决定，是经过了多次的批评和自我批评以及剧烈的思想斗争的。当然，这一决定如果从单纯经济观点来看，是对我们有着一个不小的损失。但是我们觉得作为新中国的人民出版工作者，是应该摆脱单纯经济利益的打算，而以读者和国家的利益为前提。我们决心毫不顾惜地清除质量不好的书刊。
    这次初步审阅书刊的结果，也许还不完全恰当和彻底；但是这足以表示我们今后做好出版工作的决心。我们决心认真做好出版工作。
