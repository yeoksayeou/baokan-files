　　Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Pierre Béguin, a reporter for the French "Ce Soir" newspaper, reported from Panmunjom on the 17th: At 9:40 a.m. on the 17th, U.S. aircraft bombed Kaesong in broad daylight. This is the culmination of a recent series of atrocities by the U.S. side. It is believed here that this is the most serious attempt to deliberately sabotage the negotiations, because even the feeble dark excuse that could be used to defend the atrocities is absent. This bombing occurred after U.S. aircraft invaded Northeast China and bombed prisoner-of-war camps. More strangely, it occurred precisely when three senior U.S. Air Force officers had not arrived in Panmunjom for four consecutive days. This seems to be another indication that the Americans are unwilling to cease fire and will not hesitate to sabotage the negotiations by any means.
　　The U.S. side also committed another act of sabotaging the agreement in Panmunjom on the 17th. The Americans brought in two Swiss representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross and allowed them to pester the Korean-Chinese representatives in Panmunjom. This action by the U.S. side violated the agreement between the two sides regarding the conference area, according to which only the delegations of both sides and delegation personnel may freely enter and leave the conference area. One of these two representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross is Dr. Otto Lehner, who lived in Berlin during those years in World War II and participated in a committee that visited the Nazi concentration camp in Theresienstadt, Czechoslovakia. He wrote a shameless report whitewashing the Nazi concentration camp.

    斥美方的卑鄙手段
    【新华社十八日讯】法国“今晚报”记者贝却敌十七日自板门店报道：十七日上午九时四十分，美机在白天轰炸开城，这是美方最近一连串暴行的顶点。这里认为：这是最严重的故意破坏谈判的企图，因为，甚至连可以替暴行作辩护的很无力的黑暗借口也没有。这次轰炸是发生在美机侵犯中国东北和轰炸俘虏营以后，更奇怪的是发生在正是三个美国高级空军官员接连四天没有到板门店的时候。这似乎是美国人又一次表示他们不愿意停战，不惜以任何手段破坏谈判。
    美方十七日在板门店还犯了另一次破坏协议的行为。美国人把两个瑞士籍的红十字国际委员会的代表引进来，并允许他们在板门店和朝中代表纠缠。美方的这种行动破坏了双方关于会场区的协定，根据协定，只有双方代表团、代表团人员得以自由出入会场区。这两个红十字国际委员会的代表中的一个是奥图·莱纳博士，他在第二次世界大战中的那几年住在柏林，并参加过一个委员会访问捷克斯洛伐克的特列辛地方的纳粹集中营。他曾写过无耻的报告替纳粹集中营洗刷罪恶。
