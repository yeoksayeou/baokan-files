Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 3rd. Following the earthquake disaster in Lijiang Prefecture, western Yunnan Province, since December 21st of last year, the Central People's Government is deeply concerned about the suffering of the disaster-stricken people in the area and has allocated 3 billion yuan in relief funds for emergency assistance.

The most severely affected areas in Lijiang Prefecture were Jianchuan and Heqing counties, followed by Lijiang. In the three counties, houses in a total of fifty administrative villages collapsed by 70%. All the houses in Jianchuan city were destroyed, and 70% of the houses in Heqing city also collapsed. Three hundred and ninety people were crushed to death by collapsing houses, and one thousand five hundred and thirty-seven people were slightly or seriously injured. The number of people affected by the disaster is approximately 120,000, of whom about 40,000 lost all their property. There were tremors in Zhongdian, Deqin, Weixi, Yongsheng, Huaping, Lanping, Bijiang, Fugong, Gongshan and other places, but fortunately there were no deaths, injuries, or losses.

After receiving the report of the earthquake in Lijiang Prefecture, the Central People's Government immediately allocated 3 billion yuan in emergency relief funds; and sent a special plane to transport a large quantity of tetanus antitoxin to the disaster area to treat the injured victims. The Yunnan Provincial and Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference held a meeting on December 27th of last year, deciding to mobilize the broad masses of the people throughout the province to donate money for relief, and the democratic parties and people's organizations in Kunming also decided to send representatives to the disaster area to carry out relief and consolation work. The Yunnan Provincial People's Government and the Lijiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office have both listed the relief of the earthquake disaster in Lijiang Prefecture as the top priority at present, ensuring that the injured are rescued, the dead are buried, and no one affected by the disaster will freeze or starve to death.

The people of all ethnic groups in Lijiang Prefecture are extremely moved by the deep concern of the People's Government, believing that only the People's Government under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can care so much about the suffering of the people. At present, the emotions of the disaster-stricken people in the area have become stable.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report: An earthquake occurred at 16:30 on December 21st of last year in the areas inhabited by ethnic minorities in Lijiang Prefecture, western Yunnan Province. The earthquake area includes Lijiang, Jianchuan, Heqing, Lanping, Weixi and other counties. The nature of the earthquake is a fault earthquake.

After receiving the report, the Yunnan Provincial Military and Political Committee, the Yunnan Provincial People's Government, and the Yunnan Provincial People's Representative Conference Political Consultative Conference immediately held a joint meeting and organized the Yunnan Lijiang Earthquake Relief Committee. The Provincial People's Government has already allocated 2 million catties of emergency relief grain and 2.7 billion yuan for medical expenses and resettlement expenses for relief. The Yunnan Lijiang Earthquake Relief Committee has also formed medical, investigation, and publicity groups, led by Zhou Baozhong, Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, to go to the disaster area to carry out relief work. The Yunnan Provincial People's Representative Conference Political Consultative Conference also decided to mobilize people from all walks of life in the province to carry out social relief work on December 25th of last year.

The counties of Jianchuan, Heqing, and Lijiang in Yunnan Province are located in the fault zone formed by the Gaoligong Mountains and the Nujiang and Lancang Rivers. This area has continuously experienced fault earthquakes since the Tang Dynasty. The earthquake disasters were most severe during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. When the Dali earthquake occurred in 1925, the disaster situation in Jianchuan, Heqing, and Lijiang counties was quite serious. However, at that time, the Kuomintang reactionary government did not pay much attention to the earthquake disaster, and the people of all ethnic groups in the disaster area lived in extreme poverty for a long time, with large numbers dying from injuries, illnesses, or starvation. After this earthquake occurred, the People's Government quickly carried out relief, and the people of all ethnic groups are extremely grateful.

    云南省西部丽江专区发生地震
    中央拨急赈款三十亿元进行救济
    并专派飞机运送破伤风抗毒素到灾区医治受伤灾民
    【新华社昆明三日电】云南省西部丽江专区自去年十二月二十一日地震成灾后，中央人民政府对该区灾民的痛苦极为关切，已拨赈款三十亿元作紧急救济。
    丽江专区这次地震最严重的是剑川、鹤庆两县，其次是丽江。三县共有五十个行政村房屋倒塌百分之七十，剑川城区房屋全部塌毁，鹤庆城内房屋亦倒塌百分之七十。因房屋倒塌被压死的有三百九十人，轻重伤一千五百三十七人。受灾人数约为十二万人，其中家产全部损失的约四万人。中甸、德钦、维西、永胜、华坪、兰坪、碧江、福贡、贡山等地均有震动，幸无死伤和损失。
    中央人民政府接到丽江专区发生地震的报告后，即拨急赈款三十亿元进行救济；并专派飞机运送大批破伤风抗毒素到灾区医治受伤灾民。云南省、市各界人民协商委员会于去年十二月二十七日举行会议，决定发动全省广大人民群众捐款救助，昆明市各民主党派、各人民团体亦决定派代表赴灾区进行救济及慰问工作。云南省人民政府和丽江专署都把救济丽江专区的震灾列为当前首要工作，保证做到伤者得救，死者得埋，受灾者不致冻死一人或饿死一人。
    丽江专区各族人民对人民政府的深切关怀异常感动，认为只有毛主席、共产党领导下的人民政府才能这样关怀人民的疾苦。现该区灾民情绪已趋安定。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：云南省西部丽江专区少数民族聚居区域在去年十二月二十一日十六时三十分发生地震。地震区域包括丽江、剑川、鹤庆、兰坪、维西等县。地震性质是断层地震。
    云南省军政委员会、云南省人民政府、云南省各界人民代表会议协商委员会接到报告后，即紧急召开联席会议，组织了云南丽江区震灾救济委员会。省人民政府已先拨急救粮二百万斤和医药费、安置费二十七亿元进行救济，云南丽江区震灾救济委员会并组成医疗、调查、宣传等组，由省人民政府副主席周保中率领前往灾区进行救灾工作。云南省各界人民代表会议协商委员会并决定在去年十二月二十五日动员全省各界人民进行社会救济工作。
    按云南省剑川、鹤庆、丽江等县位处高黎贡山和怒江、澜沧江所构成的断层地带，这地带自唐代以来，曾不断发生断层地震。震灾以明、清两代为最重。一九二五年大理地震发生时，剑川、鹤庆、丽江等县的灾情都相当严重。但当时国民党反动政府对震灾很不重视，灾区各民族人民曾在长时期中过着极度贫困的生活，大批地死于伤病或饥饿。这次地震发生后，人民政府迅速地进行了救济，各族人民极为感谢。
