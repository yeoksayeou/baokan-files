Comrade Fan Wenlan, Director of the Institute of Modern History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

Our academy's previous Loyalty and Honesty Movement achieved certain results. Generally speaking, everyone's ideological level has improved a step. Because ideological level has improved a step, the political and professional levels have also improved somewhat. We must cherish this achievement, but we must never think it is good enough. This is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand miles, and the future is very far away. We still need to continue our efforts and move forward step by step.

This time, our academy is launching an ideological remolding movement again. Is this the same as the Loyalty and Honesty Movement, or is it a repetition? Of course not. There are differences in terms of the purpose of the movement, as well as its breadth and depth.

Looking at the purpose of the two movements:

The Loyalty and Honesty Movement was aimed at confessing history and distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves. That is to say, it required us to clearly stand on the side of the revolutionary camp – the people’s side – and separate ourselves completely from the counter-revolutionary camp. This ideological remolding movement requires us to "eliminate the influence of imperialist and feudal reactionary ideas in the scientific community, criticize some erroneous ideas of the liberal bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, establish a revolutionary worldview, so that our scientific research work can be reformed according to the needs of national construction and the people." That is to say, it requires us intellectuals who are not of the working class ideologically to transform ourselves practically into intellectuals of the working class. To achieve this goal, I remind you: this is a very arduous task. Chairman Mao pointed out in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art that literary and art workers must solve the problem of standpoint, "To completely solve this problem, it will take a long time of ten or eight years. But no matter how long the time, we must solve it, we must solve it clearly and thoroughly." Chairman Mao's instruction to literary and art workers is also an instruction to social science workers. Comrades! How many ten or eight years does a person have? If we do not adopt a serious attitude, do not study conscientiously, and do not make up our minds to abandon our original standpoint and gradually move to the side of the working class, comrades! Time is ruthless and will not wait for us.

Looking at the breadth of the two movements:

In the Loyalty and Honesty Movement, there were indeed some people who had no historical problems and could not confess anything. In this sense, the scope of the movement was relatively narrow. This ideological remolding movement, on the other hand, requires everyone to be remolded. Because everyone's thinking, measured by the standards of the working class, may have problems, whether big or small. Who can say that their thinking is already completely and thoroughly working class and does not need to be remolded or improved? Those who say this are just proving that there is something wrong with their thinking, and a serious problem at that, requiring them to be the first to be remolded. Therefore, among those participating in this study movement, no one can claim to be an exception or adopt a bystander attitude. In this sense, the scope of the movement includes all the participants in the study, without exception, making it the broadest scope.

Looking at the depth of the two movements:

The Loyalty and Honesty Movement was relatively easy to achieve results because, unless one had ulterior motives, who would want to maintain a lingering, unclear, and disgusting relationship with the counter-revolution? As the saying goes, "A clear conscience sleeps in thunder," this principle is easy to understand, so once people think it through, they are willing to confess their history and become citizens of the People's Republic of China with a happy body and mind. This movement is different, much more difficult. Because ideological remolding is a person making a revolution in their own mind. It seems that Liang Qichao said something like, "Today's self is willing to declare war on yesterday's self." There is no need to delve into which two selves he was talking about, but this sentence is a noteworthy piece of experience. At a time when the New Democratic Revolution has triumphed and society is undergoing unprecedented changes, as an intellectual, generally speaking, one will inevitably be influenced by the revolution, that is, by the working class, and some new factors will be produced in one's thinking. These new factors gradually form "today's self," which can also be called the "new self." With the "new self," the old thinking of the self becomes "yesterday's self," the "old self." The new society under the leadership of the working class must sweep away the old society created by the exploiting class, and this is reflected in people's thinking, especially the thinking of intellectuals, urging the "new self" to wage a struggle against the "old self" and to sweep away the "old self" that has been entrenched in the head for decades. The "new self" and the "old self" struggle in the depths of the head, and only the self knows whether the "new self" is working hard. It is difficult for others to see or fully see.

We have compared the purpose, breadth, and depth of the two movements, and we can draw a conclusion that the ideological remolding movement of intellectuals is an important but very difficult matter. It is not easy to remold intellectuals, and it is naturally even more difficult to remold senior intellectuals. Why are they called senior intellectuals? A student enters a senior school, studies hard, and learns advanced philosophy, thought, knowledge, and technology. After several examinations, the president and professors of the senior school believe that the student meets the standards, so they give him bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees, and recognize him as a senior intellectual. Isn't this very good? It should be said that it is very good. But which class runs this senior school, and which class is it serving by training senior intellectuals? That is the problem. The schools in the old society were all run by reactionary classes, with the purpose of serving the reactionary classes. Therefore, all those who have received education in the old society, especially those who have received higher education, their philosophy, thought, knowledge, and technology must be branded with the mark of the reactionary class. The branding is even more significant in doctrines related to society. Intellectuals dare to be arrogant and self-righteous because they rely on this brand.

Another point worth noting is the family background of the intellectuals themselves. We know that those who can enter senior schools generally come from families with economic status at or above the petty bourgeoisie. It is impossible or very rare for children from proletarian families to enter senior schools, let alone study abroad. A senior intellectual comes from a petty-bourgeois or even a landlord-bourgeois family, receives education from reactionary classes in China and abroad, and earns a relatively wealthy and superior living from their profession. In this way, the minds of senior intellectuals inevitably contain the influence of imperialist and feudal reactionary ideas, and some erroneous ideas of the liberal bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, whether more or less, there will certainly be some. In short, all intellectuals should admit that there is something wrong with their thinking and should not avoid medical treatment.

I am an intellectual, and perhaps even a senior intellectual. I am continuing to remold myself and hope to take a step forward in this study movement. Since I and all of you present are in the same profession, according to the rules of not being polite among colleagues, we may as well expose the sores of intellectuals. A leper is afraid of people taking off his hat. Whether in summer or indoors, he always wears a hat on his head. But lepers to lepers, it's all the same, so let's open the window and speak frankly. Wouldn't everyone feel more comfortable taking off their hats and airing them out?

We know that there are many problems in the thinking of intellectuals. One of the most common problems, as Premier Zhou very politely calls it, is the "conceit" of intellectuals. We don't need to be polite with each other and honestly call it "arrogance, self-importance, and self-righteousness." Some people have a severe case of this disease, others have a mild case, and the degree of severity varies greatly. However, there are very few people who do not have this disease. Wei Wendi said, "Writers have always looked down on each other, since ancient times... each uses their strengths to look down on the others' weaknesses." It can be seen that from ancient times until now, scholars have had this disease, and senior intellectuals may have this disease even more severely. The reason for this disease is that there is something wrong with the way of thinking, exaggerating one's own strengths and obliterating one's own weaknesses; conversely, exaggerating the weaknesses of others and obliterating their strengths. "I am good, others are not good" is the formula for this disease. This subjective and one-sided way of thinking stems from individualism. Individualism is bound to be conceited, even proclaiming oneself as "I am the greatest in the world" or "ranked at the top of the world," so where is the place for others? If this disease is not removed, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought cannot be learned. I am not saying that they do not read books on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. I am saying that people who do not have the standpoint of the working class, reading books of the working class, is like a crooked-mouthed monk reciting scriptures, distorting every sentence, distorting every book, and the more they read, the more conceited and self-righteous they become, and the more distorted they become, almost to the point of being incurable. If you ask this kind of person to work, if he is a leader, he will definitely engage in autocracy and dictatorship; if he is a member of the masses, he will definitely engage in extreme democracy; if you ask him to write a book behind closed doors, what he writes will definitely be mechanical dogmatism, wasting paper. Therefore, to learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, one must first transform one's thinking. Once individualism is removed, the formula of "I am good, others are not good" will also be cancelled, and only then is it possible to truly learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and benefit from learning.

Some people think this way: since the Common Program stipulates that the four classes coexist, why is it necessary to remold the thinking of the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie? Yes, the four classes should coexist, but the thinking of the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie must be remolded under the leadership of the working class. Chairman Mao taught us in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "The elimination of classes, the elimination of state power, the elimination of the Party, all mankind must take this road, the only question is time and conditions." The Chinese Communist Party "is precisely creating conditions and striving to ensure the elimination of these things. The Communist Party and the state power of the people's dictatorship are such conditions." Everyone knows that the Chinese working class and its party – the Chinese Communist Party – are leading the Chinese people in building a New Democratic society in order to advance to a socialist society and even a communist society, in order to accomplish their great historical mission. There are no bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie in a socialist society. In order for these classes to be smoothly eliminated in due course, it is first necessary to prepare conditions for them in the New Democratic construction period, that is, the working class helps them to transform their own thinking and unify it with the thinking of the working class, that is, Mao Zedong Thought. If the old democratic ideas of the bourgeoisie and the extreme democratic ideas of the petty bourgeoisie are allowed to exist without being transformed, it will inevitably hinder the thorough realization of democratic reforms and also inevitably hinder the gradual implementation of national industrialization. This is a hazard that cannot be ignored for the construction of New Democracy, and it is an abandonment of its leadership responsibility for the working class. The situation of the people's victory in the world has been determined, and in China, the situation of the people's victory has also been determined. Those who have bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, making up their minds to transform themselves, and honestly following the working class, is the only good path. It is futile and unrewarding to subjectively try to conserve or resist. As for the influence of reactionary class ideas, which still remain now, they must be quickly eliminated, that is to say, a dictatorship must be exercised over them.

Comrades, do not be afraid when you hear about elimination and dictatorship. The so-called elimination and dictatorship on the ideological front have no other methods than criticism and self-criticism. When we conduct criticism and self-criticism, the attitude we adopt is to be kind to people, cure diseases and save people, and oppose the rude attitude of frowning and randomly putting big hats on people; the method we adopt is mutual assistance, helping every comrade's "new self" to defeat the "old self," and opposing being arrogant, considering oneself a doctor, and indiscriminately administering medicine to others. It is easy to become impatient if you don't look at other people's progress, but only at their lack of progress or slow progress. In fact, as long as others make some progress, you can help them continue to move forward. Impatience is harmful and useless.

Some comrades pit the ideological remolding movement against research work, thinking that participating in the movement will delay research. In fact, ideological remolding and research work are consistent and there is no contradiction between them. If the thinking is not well remolded, the research work will certainly not be done well. Many of our social science researchers have manuscripts that no one asks about, cannot be published, or are criticized after publication, keeping the innocent bookstore owners busy and sweating, complaining and quickly packing up the books and sending them to the paper mill for remolding. Nothing could be more wasteful of manpower and resources. The reason is none other than the fact that the author's thinking has not been well remolded or has not yet been remolded. If our thinking is first remolded, we can avoid troubling the bookstore owners, printing white paper into books, and then sending the books to the paper mill to be remolded into white paper. Is it true that those comrades who have already published articles or books but have not been criticized have already remolded their thinking and do not need to be remolded or improved again? No. You should know that after some time, when the people's cultural level has improved, these articles or books will be criticized or eliminated. Those who are complacent, self-satisfied, and arrogant today will be those who are dejected, falling behind, and lagging behind tomorrow.

Now our country is preparing for large-scale construction, and in the near future, a cultural upsurge will inevitably follow the economic upsurge. In order to adapt to this upsurge, social science researchers must first transform their individualistic thinking into collectivist thinking, that is, they must replace their minds with the minds of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This is naturally a long-term task, but it is essential to concentrate time and effort to lay a foundation in a certain period. This study movement of ours is to lay an ideological foundation for all comrades participating in the study.

After intellectuals undergo ideological remolding, even if it is only preliminary remolding, they will know what they want and what they don't want. Here are four wants and four don'ts. We want the former and don't want the latter.

A. We want unity and don't want disorganization. Our country is going to carry out large-scale construction and needs to use a large number of intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals. Only by uniting and organizing intellectuals and allocating them to the most needed places can we maximize the effectiveness of knowledge according to the plan. However, if the problem of arrogance, self-importance, and self-righteousness is not removed, it will be difficult to achieve unity, let alone ideological consistency. When intellectuals are only engaged in individual activities, their strength is actually very small and far from being able to bear the task of construction.

B. We want to constantly accept new things and don't want to stick to the old ways. New Democratic society is a rapidly developing society, and everything is changing and progressing rapidly. Intellectuals must have a high degree of spirit and courage to accept new things in order to meet objective needs. However, if the problem of arrogance, self-importance, and self-righteousness is not removed, and one feels that the old ways are good enough and there is no need to seek progress, one will inevitably become detached from the times and become a useless recluse.

C. We want to do what the people need, and we want to do what the people urgently need as soon as possible. We don't want to do what we like to do, regardless of whether the people need it or not. Because the people need to solve many problems in construction, they have great expectations for intellectuals, raise many questions, and ask for answers. If intellectuals can adapt to the needs and answer the questions raised very appropriately, the people will definitely be very satisfied with the intellectuals. However, if the problem of arrogance, self-importance, and self-righteousness is not removed, and one only relies on personal interests and ignores the needs of the people, then, frankly speaking, the people will simply not ask you for advice. The idea of "only this one, no other" is a pitiful illusion in New Democratic society.

D. We want to truly learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and make ourselves working class. We don't want to extract phrases and embellish our appearance. The purpose of learning theory is to guide our actions. We must understand the spirit and essence of the theory, gradually become familiar with it through countless practices, and integrate it into our own thinking. The role of intellectuals is greater when they learn and can use the weapons of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. However, if the problem of arrogance, self-importance, and self-righteousness is not removed, one can proudly declare that one has finished reading "On New Democracy" in one or two hours, or "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume 1 in one or two days. People who read books in this way think that they have great abilities and high knowledge, but in fact, they are only announcing their complete ignorance. It can be said with certainty that reading books in this way is of no use and may even be harmful. Haven't the false Marxists – the dogmatists – harmed people too much?

If intellectuals act according to the four wants, they will begin to embark on a bright road with unlimited prospects, and their own careers and the cause of the working class will naturally be in sync, and they will become more and more energetic as they work. The very few conservative elements who stubbornly stick to the four don'ts are trudging down a dark, dead-end alley. How can this continue in the long run? I advise these gentlemen to turn back quickly. As the saying goes, "It is not too late to correct a mistake."

Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Ideological remolding, first of all, the ideological remolding of various intellectuals, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reforms and gradually implement industrialization in all aspects. Therefore, we wish this self-education and self-transformation movement greater success in steady progress." Chairman Mao's expectations and evaluation of intellectuals are very high, and the encouragement he gives to intellectuals is very great. However, we must carefully understand:

A. The "self" mentioned by Chairman Mao, as I understand it (I don't know if it's correct), first is that ideological remolding mainly relies on one's own strength, so it is called self. Second, "self" refers to the "new self." All the help from others should be regarded as friendly forces of the "new self" in the war against the "old self," and is included in the scope of the self.

B. Chairman Mao pointed out "steady progress." Why steady progress? Because the "old self" of intellectuals resists transformation quite stubbornly. When a person has not yet realized that there is a difference between the new and the old, his mind is dominated by the arrogant, self-important, and self-righteous "old self," and he will use various means to protect his kingdom. There are indeed some people who, in a hurry, simply lie down and refuse to get up. If a child is naughty and lies on the ground to act like a rogue, you can still coax him up with a piece of candy. We cannot use candy to coax the "old self," which would increase its stubbornness. What do you say to do? The reason why the leadership and all participants in the study must make steady progress is to take into account that ordinary intellectuals have such a problem. However, precisely because of this, intellectuals should be vigilant and ask themselves to "advance quickly," and effectively urge themselves to achieve the goal of ideological remolding more quickly. "Steady progress" is a principle that the leaders of the movement and every participant in the movement must grasp. But don't be so steady that it becomes "slow progress or no progress." For each person, one should move forward quickly and steadily, and not stop on the pretext of steady progress, nor should one be so fast that one becomes impatient and rash. When thinking has not really been figured out, one should find some of the most unsightly big hats to put on oneself. After others take off that hat for him, he is still the same old mind. To use slow and steady steps for others, and quick and steady steps for oneself, one can advance steadily and quickly.

Chairman Mao has already instructed us that we should use the method of criticism and self-criticism to transform our thinking. We must carefully study the documents issued by the office on how to use this weapon. Here, I would like to raise a few points for comrades to refer to when reading the documents:

A. All those who are impatient with learning, who are perfunctory and deal with learning in a negligent manner, who advocate talking more about the future and less about the past, etc., are the "old self" building defensive fortifications. All those who forgive themselves, hope that others will forgive them, complain that others do not understand the actual situation, that criticism deviates from the facts, etc., are the "old self" looking for air-raid shelters. The "new self" should adopt a resolute revolutionary attitude and wage an uncompromising struggle against the "old self."

B. Enlarge the horizons, broaden the tolerance, and put down the airs, so that the "old self" has nowhere to hide. The "new self" should bravely attack and at the same time welcome others to help search for the lurking "old self," capture all of the "old self," and hold a mass meeting to publicly try and convict the "old self." The severely guilty should be "beheaded and displayed to the public." Comrades, do not misunderstand my meaning. I mean, work hard yourself, get help from others, study and analyze together, use the method of criticism and self-criticism to get rid of the old and bring forth the new, openly admit mistakes, educate yourself and educate others, and complete the arduous task of transforming thinking.

C. Be modest and prudent, look more at yourself, look at yourself first. Don't assume that there is nothing wrong with your thinking and reach out to prepare to rectify others, and then become passive and negligent when you are rectified yourself. You should be just as active in rectifying others as you are in rectifying yourself. First, you must rectify yourself, that is to say, everyone must first prepare to make self-criticism and ruthlessly expose their shortcomings and mistakes.

D. We must firmly grasp the spirit of being kind to people and curing diseases and saving people, and we must not allow the slightest base and ulterior motives. However, those who are criticized must not speculate on the motives of others, or seize on a certain incorrect opinion, or emphasize that the method and attitude are not good, as a tool to resist criticism and refuse transformation. If you do this, it proves that the "old self" is still in a dominant position in the mind, and the strength of the "new self" must be strengthened to transform it.

The leadership is very serious about this study movement, and the task of each of us participants is very important. The office stipulates that every participant must read the documents and take notes. I am presenting my speech today as my notes from reading the documents, asking for everyone's criticism, and also asking the office to give me instructions and criticism as a review of the notes.

    科学工作者应怎样展开“新我”对“旧我”的斗争
    ——在中国科学院研究人员学习会上的讲话
    中国科学院近代史研究所所长  范文澜
    上次我院进行忠诚老实运动取得了一定的成绩。大家的思想水平一般说起来提高了一步。因为思想水平提高一步，政治水平业务水平也跟着有些提高。我们要珍重这个成绩，但决不可认为够好了。这只是万里长征的开头第一步，前途远得很哩，还待我们继续努力一步步向前行进。
    这次我院又要发动思想改造运动，这和忠诚老实运动，是不是重复呢？当然不是。从运动的目的来看，从运动的宽度和深度来看，都是有区别的。
    从两个运动的目的来看：
    忠诚老实运动是要交代历史、分清敌我，这就是说，要求我们明确地站在革命阵营方面，——人民方面，与反革命阵营分家绝缘。这一次思想改造运动是要求我们“肃清科学界中帝国主义和封建主义的反动思想的影响，批评自由资产阶级和小资产阶级的一些错误思想，确立革命的人生观，从而使我们的科学研究工作能根据国家建设和人民的要求来进行改革”。这就是说，要求我们这些思想上非工人阶级的知识分子切实地改造成为工人阶级的知识分子。要达到这个目的，我提醒一声：这是一个非常艰巨的工作。毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话里指出，文艺工作者必须解决立场问题，“要彻底解决这个问题，非有十年八年的长期时间不可。但是时间无论怎样长，我们却必须解决它，必须明确地彻底地解决它”。毛主席教导文艺工作者，同样也是教导社会科学工作者。同志们！一个人能有几个十年八年？如果我们不采取严肃态度，不认真学习，不下决心放弃自己原来的立场，逐渐地移到工人阶级方面来，同志们！时间是无情的，它决不会等待我们。
    从两个运动的宽度来看：
    忠诚老实运动中确有一部分人历史上实在没有问题，不可能交代出什么东西来。从这个意义上说，运动的面是比较狭窄的。这次思想改造运动则是每一个人都得要改造。因为每一个人的思想，以工人阶级思想作标准来衡量的话，也许大，也许小，都免不了有毛病。谁能说自己思想已经完全十足的工人阶级化，不需要再改造，再提高呢？这样说的人，正好证明他思想上有毛病，而且是严重的毛病，必需要求他首先改造。所以凡是参加这次学习运动的人，没有一个人可以自称例外，采取旁观态度。从这个意义上说，运动的面是包括全部学习人员在内，没有一个人在外的最宽的面。
    从两个运动的深度来看：
    忠诚老实运动收效比较容易，因为除非别有居心，谁愿意与反革命保持拖泥带水不清不白的可厌关系呢？俗话说：“心里没有亏心事，半夜敲门不吃惊”，这个道理是容易懂得的，所以一经想通，就愿意把历史交代出来，身心愉快地做一个中华人民共和国的国民。现在这个运动可不同了，困难得多了。因为思想改造是人在头脑里自己革自己的命。好像梁启超说过一句话：“今日之我不惜与昨日之我宣战。”他所说的那两个我。无须推究，这句话却是一句值得注目的经验之谈。正当今天新民主主义革命胜利，社会发生空前大变动的时候，作为一个知识分子，一般说来，必然要受到来自革命方面即工人阶级方面的影响，思想里产生一些新因素。这些新因素逐渐形成为“今日之我”，也可以叫做“新我”。有了“新我”，旧思想的我就成为“昨日之我”成“旧我”了。工人阶级领导下的新社会一定要扫灭那个剥削阶级所造成的旧社会，反映到人们的思想上，首先是知识分子的思想上，催促着“新我”向“旧我”进行斗争，要把蟠据在脑袋里数十年之久的“旧我”扫灭掉。“新我”和“旧我”在一个脑袋的深处最深处斗争，“新我”是否努力，只有自己知道，别人是难得看出或完全看出的。
    我们把两个运动的目的、宽度、深度做了一下比较，可以得出一个结论，就是知识分子的思想改造运动是一件重要的但是困难很不小的事情。本来改造知识分子已经不容易，改造高级知识分子，自然更不容易。为什么叫做高级知识分子呢？一个学生进入高级学校苦学苦干，学会了高级的哲学、思想，知识和技术，经过若干次考试，高级学校的校长教授，认为这个学生够标准了，于是给他学士、硕士、博士等学位，承认他是高级的知识分子。这不是很好么？应该说是很好。可是这个高级学校是那个阶级办的，培养高级知识分子是为那个阶级服务的，问题就在这里。旧社会的学校都是反动阶级办的，目的在于为反动阶级服务。所以凡是受过旧社会教育特别是受过高级教育的人，他的哲学、思想、知识、技术，都不能不打上反动阶级的烙印。在有关社会的学说上烙印打得更是十分显著。知识分子敢于自高自大自以为是，也就因为他自恃有这个烙印。
    还有一点值得注意，那就是知识分子自己出身的家庭。我们知道，能进高级学校的人，他的家庭的经济地位，一般是在小资产阶级以上，无产者家里的子弟是不可能或极少可能进高级学校的，更不用说到外国留学了。一个高级知识分子，出身在小资产阶级以至地主资产阶级的家庭，受的是中国外国反动阶级的教育，自己的职业收入，又过着比较富裕优越的生活。这样，高级知识分子的头脑里，必然存在着帝国主义、封建主义的反动思想的影响，自由资产阶级、小资产阶级的一些错误思想，不管多或少，反正不会一点也没有。归根一句话，知识分子都应该承认自己思想有毛病，不要讳疾忌医。
    我是个知识分子，可能也算是一个高级知识分子，我正在继续改造，想在这一次学习运动中前进一步。既然我和在座诸位是同行，按照同行不客气的规矩，我们不妨来揭发知识分子的癞头疮。癞子怕人摘掉他的帽子，夏天也好，屋里也好，总要戴帽子在头上。但是癞子对癞子，彼此彼此，索性打开窗门说亮话，大家把帽子摘下来透透空气，岂不感到痛快些。
    我们知道知识分子思想上有许多毛病，其中最普通的一种病，周总理很客气，叫做知识分子的“自负”。我们彼此不必客气，老实叫做“自高自大，自以为是”。这种病，有的人重，有的人轻，轻重程度极不一样。不过不生这个病的人是极少的。魏文帝说：“文人相轻，自古而然，……各以所长，相轻所短”，可见自古代一直到现在，读书人都要生这种病，高级知识分子也许生这个病更厉害些。生这个病的原因，是思想方法有毛病，夸大自己的长处，抹煞自己的短处；反之，夸大别人的短处，抹煞别人的长处。“自己好，别人不好”就是这个毛病的公式。这种主观的片面的思想方法，根源在于个人中心主义。个人中心主义一定自命不凡，甚至自封为“老子天下第一”或“名列天下前茅”，那还有别人的地位呢？这个毛病如果不去掉，什么马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想是学不进去的。我不是说他们不读关于马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的书。我说的是非工人阶级立场的人，读工人阶级的书，好比歪嘴和尚念经，念一句，歪一句，念一本，歪一本，念得愈多，自高自大、自以为是的毛病愈沉重，也就歪得愈益厉害，几乎到不可救药的地步。这种人请他做工作吧，当领导，一定要闹专制独裁；当群众，一定要闹极端民主；请他闭门著书吧，写出来的东西一定是机械教条，浪费稿纸。所以学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，首先必须改造思想，个人中心主义去掉了，“自己好，别人不好”那个公式也就取消了，这才有可能真正学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，得到学习的好处。
    有的人这样想，既然共同纲领规定四个阶级同时并存，为什么还要改造小资产阶级和资产阶级的思想呢？是的，四个阶级应该并存，但小资产阶级和资产阶级的思想却必须在工人阶级领导下进行改造。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”里教导我们：“消灭阶级，消灭国家权力，消灭党，全人类都要走这一条路的，问题只是时间和条件”。中国共产党“恰是为着促使这些东西的消灭而创设条件，而努力奋斗。共产党和人民专政的国家权力，就是这样的条件”。谁都知道，中国工人阶级和它的政党——中国共产党为完成自己伟大的历史使命，正在领导中国人民建设新民主主义社会，以便前进到社会主义社会以至于共产主义社会。社会主义社会里并没有资产阶级和小资产阶级，那时候要这些阶级顺利地应时消灭，首先必须在新民主主义建设时期给它们准备下条件，那就是工人阶级帮助它们改造自己的思想，统一于工人阶级思想即毛泽东思想。如果资产阶级的旧民主主义思想和小资产阶级的极端民主思想任其存在，不加以改造，必然妨碍民主改革的彻底实现，也必然妨碍国家工业化的逐步实行。这对新民主主义的建设事业说来，是不容忽视的危害，对工人阶级说来，是放弃自己的领导责任。世界上人民胜利的局面已经确定了，在中国，人民胜利的局面也已经确定了。存有资产阶级小资产阶级思想的人，下决心自我改造，老老实实跟着工人阶级走，才是唯一的好道路。主观上还想保守或抵御都是徒然的，劳而无功的。至于反动阶级思想的影响，现在还残留着的，更必须迅速予以消灭，就是说，要对它实行专政。
    同志们，不要听了消灭和专政就害怕起来，思想战线上的所谓消灭和专政，除了进行批评和自我批评，别无其他方式。我们进行批评和自我批评时，采取的态度是与人为善、治病救人，反对横眉怒目，乱扣大帽子的粗暴态度；采取的方法是大家互助，帮助每一同志的“新我”，去战胜“旧我”，反对盛气凌人，自居于医生地位，拿着药给别人乱灌。不看别人的进步，只看别人的不进步或进步太慢，就容易犯急躁病。其实，只要别人多少有些进步，就可以帮助他继续前进，急躁是有害无益的。
    有些同志把思想改造运动与研究工作对立起来，以为参加运动要耽误研究。事实上思想改造与研究工作是一致的，其间并无矛盾。思想没有改造好，研究工作也一定不会做好。我们研究社会科学的，有不少稿子无人问津，不能出版，或出版后受了批评，忙得无辜的书店老板满头大汗，口吐怨言，赶快把书收拾起来送到造纸厂去改造。劳民伤财，莫此为甚。原因不是别的，只是因为写稿者思想没有改造好或还没有改造的缘故。如果我们的思想先改造一番，也就免得劳书店老板的驾，把白纸印成书，再把书送造纸厂改造成白纸了。是不是已经发表了文章或书但没有受批评的同志，思想已经改造好无须再改造再提高呢？不是的。要知道过些时人民的文化水平提高了，这些文章或书将要被批评或被淘汰，今天故步自封、骄傲自满的人，就是明天垂头丧气，掉队落伍的人。
    现在我们国家正在准备大建设，不久的将来，文化高潮必然跟着经济高潮而到来。社会科学研究工作者要适应这个高潮，首先要把个人中心主义的思想改造为集体主义的思想，也就是要把自己的头脑换成马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的头脑。这自然是长期的工作，但集中时间和力量在一定时期里打下一个基础是十分必要的。我们这个学习运动，就是要给一切参加学习的同志打下一个思想基础。
    知识分子经过思想改造，那怕是初步的改造，他将会知道要什么，不要什么。下面举出四要四不要，我们要前者不要后者。
    甲、要团结一致——不要自由散漫。我们国家要大规模建设，需要使用大量知识分子，特别是高级知识分子。把知识分子团结起来，组织起来，分配到最需要的地方去，才能按照计划发挥知识的最大效力。但是自高自大、自以为是的毛病如果不去掉，团结就很难做好，思想一致更谈不到，而知识分子当他只是个人活动的时候，力量实在很微小，远不能负担起建设的任务。
    乙、要不断接受新鲜事物——不要保持老一套。新民主主义社会是飞跃发展的社会，一切事物都在迅速变化进步，知识分子要有高度的接受新鲜事物的精神和勇气，才能符合客观的需要。但是自高自大、自以为是的毛病如果不去掉，觉得自己老一套很可以了，不必再求进步，势必脱离时代，变成失去作用的向隅者。
    丙、要人民需要什么，我就做什么：人民迫切需要什么，我就赶紧做什么——不要我爱什么就做什么，人民要不要听便。人民在建设中因为需要解决许多问题，对知识分子抱着很大期望，提出许多问题，要求解答。知识分子能够适应需要，把提出来的问题，很恰当地作解答，人民一定对知识分子很满意。但是自高自大、自以为是的毛病如果不去掉，只凭个人的兴趣，不顾人民的需要，那样的工作，老实说，人民只好不向你请教。“只此一家，别无分店”的想法，在新民主主义社会里是一种可怜的幻想。
    丁、要真正学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，使自己工人阶级化——不要摘引辞句、装点门面。学习理论为的是指导自己的行动，要体会理论的精神和实质，从无数次实践中慢慢熟习起来，融化成自己的思想。知识分子学会而且能够运用马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想的武器，知识分子作用就大了。但是，如果自高自大自以为是的毛病不去掉，可以傲然宣称一两个钟头读完“新民主主义论”，一两天读完“毛泽东选集”第一卷，这样读书的人，自以为本领大，学问高，其实只是宣布他自己的十足无知。可以肯定地说，这样读书，丝毫没有用处，而且有害人的可能。假马克思主义者——教条主义者不是害人害得太多了么？
    知识分子按照四要做去，这就开始走上前程无限的光明大道，自己的事业和工人阶级的事业自然合起拍来，愈干愈得劲。固执四不要的极少数保守分子，踯躅在一条此路不通的阴黑断巷里，长此以往，如何得了。奉劝这些先生们快快回头。俗话说得好：“过而能改，未为晚也。”
    毛主席在人民政协全国委员会第三次会议开会辞里说：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。因此，我们预祝这个自我教育和自我改造运动能够在稳步前进中获得更大的成就。”毛主席对知识分子的期望和估价是很高的，给知识分子的鼓励是很大的。但是，我们要仔细体会一下：
    甲、毛主席指出的“自我”二字，照我的了解（不知对不对）第一是思想改造主要依靠自己的力量，所以叫做自我。其次是“自我”指“新我”而言，所有别人的帮助，应看作“新我”对“旧我”作战时的友军，包括在自我范围之内。
    乙、毛主席指出“稳步前进”。为什么要稳步呢？因为知识分子的“旧我”抵抗改造相当顽强。当一个人还没有觉悟到我有新旧的区别时，他的头脑被自高自大自以为是的“旧我”支配着，不惜用各种手段来保护他的王国。确有一种人，发了急，索性来个躺倒不起身。小孩子顽皮，躺地学赖地羊，还可以拿块糖哄他起来。我们对“旧我”却不能用糖哄，增长他的顽固性，你说怎样办？要领导上和一切参加学习的人稳步前进的原因，就在于照顾到一般知识分子有那么一种的毛病。但是，正因为如此，知识分子应该警惕起来，要求自己“快步前进”，切实督促自己，快些达到思想改造的目的。“稳步前进”这是运动的领导者和每一个运动参加者都必须掌握的原则。但不要稳得变成“慢步不进”。每个人对自己说来，要用快而稳的步伐迅速前进，不要藉口稳步，停顿不进，也不要快得变成急躁轻率，思想实在没有打通的时候，便找些最难看的大帽子给自己扣上，等到别人替他去掉那顶帽子以后，依然还是那个老脑袋。对人用慢慢的稳步，对自己用快快的稳步，能这样做，可以稳而快的前进。
    改造思想要用批评与自我批评的方法，毛主席已经指示我们了。如何使用这个武器，办公室发下来的文件我们必须仔细研读。这里我想提出几点来，供同志们读文件时作参考：
    甲、凡是对学习不耐烦，对学习怠工应付，主张多谈将来、免谈过去等等，都是“旧我”在筑防御工事。凡是自己给自己原谅，希望别人原谅，埋怨别人不了解实际情况，批评与事实有出入等等，都是“旧我”在找防空洞。“新我”对“旧我”应采取坚决的革命态度，毫不妥协地进行斗争。
    乙、放大眼界、放宽度量、放下面子，使“旧我”无处容身。“新我”应奋勇进攻，同时欢迎别人帮助来搜索潜伏着的“旧我”，把“旧我”全部俘获，召开群众大会，把“旧我”公审判罪。其重者“枭首示众”。同志们不要误会我的意思。我是说，自己努力，别人帮助，共同研究分析，用批评与自我批评的方法来除旧布新，公开承认错误，教育自己也教育别人，完成改造思想的艰巨任务。
    丙、谦虚谨慎，多看看自己，先看看自己。不要自以为思想没毛病，伸手准备整别人，整到自己便消极怠工。应该整别人整自己同样积极。首先要整自己，就是说，每个人都要先准备作自我批评，无情地揭露自己的缺点和错误。
    丁、我们必须紧紧掌握与人为善治病救人的精神，不允许有丝毫卑劣不可告人的动机。但被批评者却不可揣测别人的动机，或抓住某一点不正确的意见，或强调方式、态度不好，作为抵抗批评拒绝改造的工具。这样做的话，证明“旧我”还在头脑里占统治地位，还得加强“新我”的力量来改造。
    此次学习运动，领导上非常认真，我们每一参加者的任务非常重大，办公室规定每一个参加者都得读文件、做笔记。我今天的讲话，作为我读文件的笔记，提出来请大家批评，也请办公室作为抽阅笔记，给我指示和批评。（原载一月六日光明日报）
