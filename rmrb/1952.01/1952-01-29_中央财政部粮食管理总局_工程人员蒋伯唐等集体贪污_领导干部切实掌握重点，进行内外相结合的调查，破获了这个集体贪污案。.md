Central Ministry of Finance Grain Administration Bureau
Collective Embezzlement by Engineer Jiang Botang and Others
Leading cadres effectively grasped key points, conducted internal and external investigations, and cracked this collective embezzlement case.

In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the Grain Administration Bureau of the Central People's Government Ministry of Finance exposed the collective embezzlement by most of the engineering personnel of the bureau's engineering department. This was the result of fully mobilizing the masses, leading cadres correctly grasping the key points, seizing upon suspicious clues, and implementing internal and external investigation and research.

In 1951, the engineering department of this bureau directly managed a total of five construction projects. Except for the office building being built for the Ministry of Finance headquarters, where no problems have yet been found, embezzlement and waste occurred in the other four projects. The raw materials for these four projects were all provided by the Ministry of Finance itself, but the personnel managing the projects still embezzled wages and management fees. For example, the total contract and management fee for the Fengtai warehouse was 248 million yuan. Part of the funds was controlled by Deputy Chief Engineer Jiang Botang. Because Jiang was extravagant and lived a corrupt life, he colluded with the contractor during construction, reduced the amount of work done, over-reported labor costs, and embezzled 22 million yuan. This money was split between Jiang Botang and Assistant Engineer Tang Jianbing. Contractors Ling Guojian and Cai Yuxiang also extracted 43 million yuan. These two merchants stole 25 percent of the total labor and management fees. When building the Dahongmen warehouse outside Yongdingmen, engineers Jiang Botang and Tang Jianbing purchased wood from Tianhe Timber Factory. This factory did not actually have this wood, so it turned to other timber factories to purchase and resell it, making a huge profit of 300 million yuan in the process, and bribed Jiang and Tang with 10 million yuan in kickbacks. This project was contracted by builder Huang Heyun, and his wages and equipment costs totaled 360 million yuan. Jiang, Tang, and Huang Heyun colluded with each other and embezzled 13 million yuan during the construction process. When building the Ministry of Finance’s Damochang dormitory and the Central Taxation School auditorium, engineers Lü Wenyan and Xu Guohua introduced Shanghai contractors Zhang Yunliang and Niu Yongji Construction Factory to undertake the contracts respectively. The contractors and the engineering personnel, including Lü and Xu, colluded internally and externally, embezzling 43 million yuan, which was split among engineers Lü Wenyan, Xu Guohua, Gu Jiuyan, and Jiang Botang. In total, Jiang Botang and others from the above engineering department embezzled more than 110 million yuan.

When the movement began, the Grain Administration Bureau identified the engineering department as one of the key areas for inspection. However, due to the lack of materials and the fact that the engineering department was mostly composed of technical personnel, and the director was not very knowledgeable in technology, the movement could not be carried out smoothly. After the mass confession, inspection, and reporting movement began, the engineering personnel only talked about waste or bureaucracy, not about corruption, and claimed that they had no problems, attempting to muddle through. Seeing that the movement could not be deepened and the key points could not be broken through, the leading cadres of the Grain Administration Bureau turned to external investigations. When inspecting the Dahongmen warehouse project in the past, they had suspected that there was a problem with the wood. Gu Zhenfa, who introduced Jiang Botang and others to Tianhe Timber Factory to purchase materials, had also confessed at the beginning of the movement that Tianhe Timber Factory had given him two packages of gifts during the Mid-Autumn Festival last year. Based on this clue, they tracked down and investigated Tianhe Timber Factory, where they happened to encounter Assistant Engineer Tang Jianbing inside the factory, acting suspiciously. At this time, they quickly adopted a combined internal and external approach: on the one hand, they mobilized Tang to confess voluntarily, and on the other hand, they questioned Tianhe Timber Factory. At this time, Tang Jianbing still firmly denied it, and the manager of Tianhe Timber Factory also hesitated. However, Tang Jianbing, Jiang Botang, and others felt the atmosphere was tense and it would be difficult to muddle through, so they secretly discussed again, and Tang Jianbing began to admit that he had borrowed 10 million yuan from Tianhe Timber Factory; the manager of Tianhe Timber Factory also sent a letter to the warehouse at the same time, admitting to bribery of 10 million yuan. After the problem was revealed, the Grain Administration Bureau immediately held a general meeting of cadres to expose the matter, clarify policies, and call for confession. After the meeting, Chief Engineer Gu Jiuyan first confessed, and Jiang Botang, Tang Jianbing, Lü Wenyan, Xu Guohua, Gu Zhenfa, and others also successively confessed all the facts of embezzlement.

    中央财政部粮食管理总局
    工程人员蒋伯唐等集体贪污
    领导干部切实掌握重点，进行内外相结合的调查，破获了这个集体贪污案。
    中央人民政府财政部所属粮食管理总局在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，揭露了这个局的工程处大部工程人员的集体贪污行为。这是充分发动群众，领导干部正确地掌握重点，抓紧可疑线索，实行内外相结合的调查研究的结果。
    这个局的工程处，在一九五一年直接经管的建筑工程共有五处。除中央财政部本部修建的办公楼房尚未发现问题外，其他四处工程中，都发生了贪污浪费现象。这四处工程的原材料都是财政部自备的，但管理工程的人员，仍然在工资和管理费用上，进行了贪污。如，丰台仓库的全部包工和管理费共二亿四千八百万元，其中部分款项由副总工程师蒋伯唐掌握，蒋因挥霍无度，生活腐化，即在施工期间，和承包商人狼狈为奸，以偷工方式，多报人工，从中贪污二千二百万元。这笔钱由蒋伯唐和助理工程师唐鉴冰分了。承包商凌国建、蔡裕祥亦从中剥削四千三百万元。这两个商人，前后盗窃了全部人工费与管理费的百分之二十五。修建永定门外大红门仓库时，工程师蒋伯唐、唐鉴冰向天和木厂购买木料。这个厂实际上并没有这项木料，即转向其他木厂购进卖出，转手间获得暴利三亿元，以回扣方式，贿赂蒋、唐一千万元。这个工程系由营造商黄鹤云承揽，其工资和设备费共为三亿六千万元。蒋、唐和黄鹤云相互勾结，在施工过程中贪污一千三百万元。修建中央财政部打磨厂宿舍和中央税务学校礼堂时，由工程师吕文嵓、徐国华等介绍上海包商张云良和钮永记营造厂分别承包。承包商和吕、徐等工程人员里应外合，贪污达四千三百万元，由工程师吕文嵓、徐国华、顾久衍、蒋伯唐四人分了。以上工程处蒋伯唐等先後贪污共达一亿一千余万元。
    运动开始时，粮食管理总局即确定工程处为检查重点之一。但因掌握材料不多，加以工程处多为技术人员，处长不太懂技术，致运动未能顺利展开。群众性的坦白、检查、检举运动开始后，工程人员都谈浪费或官僚主义，不谈贪污，并表示他们没有问题，企图混过“关”去。粮食管理总局的领导干部见运动不能深入，重点不能突破，即转向外部进行调查。过去在检验大红门仓库工程时，即曾怀疑木料有问题。介绍蒋伯唐等前往天和木厂购料的顾振发在运动开始时，又曾坦白出天和木厂在去年中秋节送给他两包礼物。根据这个线索，便追踪到天和木厂调查，适遇助理工程师唐鉴冰在木厂内，行动鬼祟可疑。这时便迅速采取内外夹攻办法：一面动员唐自动坦白，一面追问天和木厂。这时唐鉴冰仍坚决否认，天和木厂经理也支吾其词。但唐鉴冰和蒋伯唐等已感觉空气紧张，很难混过，他们又再度秘商，由唐鉴冰开始承认曾向天和木厂借款一千万元；天和木厂经理在同时间内，也向仓库去信承认行贿一千万元。问题揭开以后，粮食管理总局即召开全局干部大会，进行揭发，并阐明政策、号召坦白。会议过后，总工程师顾久衍首先坦白，蒋伯唐、唐鉴冰、吕文嵓、徐国华、顾振发等，也相继坦白了全部贪污事实。　　　　　　（孟周）
