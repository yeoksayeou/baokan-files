Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 22nd: On January 22nd, the opposing liaison officer, Mr. Mulloy, personally witnessed the bullet-riddled truck of the Korean-Chinese delegation at Panmunjom, which had been strafed by U.S. aircraft on the 18th. Three staff members of the Korean-Chinese delegation who were attacked testified today at the meeting of liaison officers from both sides in Panmunjom. Mulloy adopted the method of individually questioning witnesses in an attempt to find fault and deny the attack. However, all three witnesses confirmed that four U.S. aircraft continuously dive-bombed and strafed the Korean-Chinese delegation convoy at a point 40 meters north of the Hanp'o Bridge at 4:40 PM on the 18th, with bullets landing around the trucks. The convoy was forced to stop only after the driver of the first truck was wounded by machine gun fire. All three witnesses said that they did not hear any ground artillery fire when the convoy was attacked. After two hours and forty-five minutes of investigation, Mulloy had to admit that "some conclusion can be reached." However, he still attempted to evade responsibility for attacking the convoy, saying that "the evidence still needs to be studied."

On January 22nd, our liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, once again called Mr. Mulloy's attention to the fact that the other side was delaying the handling of the U.S. aircraft bombing of the Kaesong neutral zone on the 17th. Colonel Zhang Chunshan pointed out that the U.S. aircraft bombing of the Kaesong neutral zone has been going on for six days, with three investigations conducted and conclusive evidence, but the other side has still not taken responsibility for it.

At around 1:20 PM today, another U.S. aircraft flew low and circled over Kaesong. At around 3:30 PM, just as the meeting of liaison officers from both sides was taking place, four more American jet fighters flew over the Panmunjom meeting area, which was witnessed by reporters on the scene. This is clearly a blatant violation of the agreement. The fact that the other side is delaying the handling of violations of the agreement and that the behavior of violating the agreement is increasing deserves the close attention of people all over the world.

### 对美机攻击我方代表团车队罪行  美方仍图逃避责任

    对美机攻击我方代表团车队罪行
    美方仍图逃避责任
    【新华社开城二十二日电】二十二日对方联络官穆莱在板门店亲眼看到了十八日被美机扫射的弹痕累累的朝中代表团的一辆卡车。遭受扫射的朝中代表团三个工作人员今日在板门店双方联络官会议上作证。穆莱采取个别询问证人办法进行调查，企图找岔子作抵赖。但三个证人都证实：美机四架于十八日午后四时四十分在汗浦桥以北四十公尺处连续俯冲扫射轰炸朝中代表团车队，弹落卡车四周。当第一辆卡车上的司机被机枪弹打伤后，车队始被迫停止前进。三个证人都说：在车队遭到攻击时，他们没有听见地面炮火射击声。经过两小时四十五分的调查，穆莱不得不承认：“多少可以得到结论。”但他仍企图逃避攻击车队的责任，说什么“还要回去研究证据。”
    二十二日我方联络官张春山上校就对方对美机十七日轰炸开城中立区迟迟不处理事，又一次提起穆莱注意。张春山上校指出：美机轰炸开城中立区已历时六天，前后经过三次调查，证据确凿，但对方仍未负责处理。
    今日午后一时二十分左右，又有美机一架低飞开城上空盘旋。三时半左右，正当双方联络官会议时，又有四架美国喷气式飞机飞越板门店会场区上空，为在场记者所目睹，显然是公开违反协议。对方对已违反协议事件迟不处理，而破坏协议行为有增无减的情形，值得全世界人民密切注意。
