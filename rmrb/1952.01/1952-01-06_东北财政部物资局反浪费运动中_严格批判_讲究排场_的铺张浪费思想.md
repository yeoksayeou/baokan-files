In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the Materials Bureau of the Northeast People's Government Finance Department conducted a relatively thorough inspection of various extravagant and wasteful phenomena, criticized the "ostentation-oriented" wasteful thinking among cadres, corrected all behaviors that violated financial discipline and financial systems, and further formulated a comprehensive savings plan.

For a long time, the political atmosphere among cadres in the Materials Bureau was not strong, and it was impossible to carry out criticism and self-criticism. Some cadres lacked a strong sense of responsibility, often causing undue losses to materials. At the same time, the request and report system has not yet been truly established, and a lack of in-depth investigation and research often affects the correct and timely handling of materials. For example, during a certain material allocation, due to insufficient investigation of prices and a lack of understanding of the specifications and quality of the materials, materials with costs higher than the market price were mechanically priced at 80% of the market price, resulting in a loss of 888.1 million yuan. This problem was discovered in June of last year, but it was not reported to the bureau director. In basic construction, unplanned changes in projects, errors in material calculations, and delays in supply often led to shutdowns and waiting for materials, causing serious waste of manpower, transportation, and materials. For example, the light rails used for the construction of light railways were mistakenly specified as twelve kilograms per meter instead of twelve pounds per yard, resulting in excess width and insufficient length, requiring additional budget. Coupled with waste in other aspects, the total loss amounted to more than 900 million yuan. The waste of manpower was also astonishing. A cadre in the Education Section had official "business" to "handle" for only a little over one hundred days out of more than seven hundred days; the rest of the time, there was no formal work to do.

A segment of veteran cadres gradually developed the thinking of "paying attention to ostentation" and "seeking comfort." They mistakenly believed that after entering the big city, they should "normalize" and therefore liked to compare themselves with other agencies in terms of "generosity." In addition, the agency had a "small fortune," making it easy to "take care" of cadres, so many expenditures that did not comply with the system appeared. Overspending on food, tea, cigarettes, and travel expenses for cadres returning home was significant, with extra clothing subsidies reaching as many as five or six sets. From January to September of last year, expenditures exceeding the system amounted to more than 160 million yuan (not including in-kind subsidies).

In March of last year, the Materials Bureau decided to add some furniture, and some cadres were very "active" in this regard, delaying some work and buying back a lot of fancy furniture. All office furniture was replaced with new furniture in order to achieve "uniformity." At that time, some cadres felt that this approach was not right, and Party members and the masses also reflected, saying: "During the period of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, there should not be such ostentation." Some Party members even formally submitted written opinions, but the parties involved did not think this was wrong.

When this issue was examined during the anti-extravagance and anti-waste campaign, it also encountered great ideological resistance. The several cadres in charge still believed that this was a work need and could not be considered waste. Some said it was for "confidentiality" (referring to new desks that could be locked); others said it was for "hygiene and reducing disease"; some even absurdly said that, according to the historical materialist viewpoint, everything should be viewed from its development: the agency needs to develop, and buying more furniture will always be useful.

The Materials Bureau's Party branch first criticized the "extravagance" thinking within the Party, pointing out that the growth of this thinking was due to the erosion of bourgeois ideology and the destruction of the revolutionary tradition of hard work and simplicity. Subsequently, leading cadres at all levels made profound self-criticisms, and some have already turned over items they received that were not in accordance with the system.

The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement strengthened the concept of cherishing national wealth among all staff. In this movement, the method of detailed accounting was adopted, enabling everyone to realize that every small negligence in work could cause significant waste. For example, the loss caused by non-compliant light rails was enough to build a warehouse.

In addition to clearing the "assets" and submitting them to higher authorities, establishing a job responsibility system, and streamlining personnel, the Materials Bureau also formulated an agency savings plan. The entire bureau saved more than 16 million yuan per month just by stopping expenditures that exceeded the system, equivalent to twenty-six tons of grain. In addition, by carefully calculating in all aspects such as coal, gasoline, office sundries, and water and electricity, it is estimated that about 26 million yuan, equivalent to forty-two tons of grain, can be saved within the funding standards by March of this year.

### 东北财政部物资局反浪费运动中  严格批判“讲究排场”的铺张浪费思想

    东北财政部物资局反浪费运动中
    严格批判“讲究排场”的铺张浪费思想
    东北人民政府财政部物资局，在反贪污浪费、反官僚主义运动中，对各种铺张浪费现象，作了一次比较彻底的检查，批评了干部中“讲究排场”的铺张浪费思想，纠正了一切违反财政纪律、财政制度的行为，并进一步制订出全面节约计划。
    长久以来，物资局干部间政治空气不浓，无法展开批评与自我批评。某些干部责任心不强，常使物资遭受不应有的损失。同时由于请示报告制度尚未真正建立起来，缺乏深入的调查研究，也往往影响到对物资的正确、及时的处理。如某次拨付物资时，因调查物价不够仔细，对物资的规格、质量不了解，将成本高于市价的物资，机械地按照市价八折作价，损失了八亿八千一百余万元。这个问题在去年六月份即已发现，但并未向局长报告。在基本建设上，因计划不周，中途变更工程，材料计算错误，供应不及时所招致的停工待料等等，常常造成人力、运输力、材料等方面的严重浪费。如建筑轻便铁道使用的轻轨，将一码十二磅的规格，误为一米十二公斤，结果宽度有余，长度不足，还得追加预算，加上其他方面的浪费，损失共达九亿余元。人力的浪费亦是惊人的，教育科有个干部，在七百多天中只有一百多天有“公”可“办”，其他时间都没有正式工作做。
    一部分老干部逐渐滋长着“讲究排场”、“贪图舒服”的思想。他们错误地认为进了大城市，应该“正规化”，因而喜欢向别的机关比“阔气”。加上本机关有“小家底”，便于“照顾”干部，于是就出现了很多不合制度的开支。伙食、茶、烟、干部回家旅费等超支数字很大，额外补助衣服有多达五、六套者。去年一月到九月超过制度的开支达一亿六千多万元（实物补助尚不在内）。
    去年三月，物资局决定添置一部分家具，一些干部对此非常“积极”，耽误若干工作，买回来许多讲究的家具。办公室内一律换新家具，以求“整齐”。当时有些干部觉得这种做法不对头，党员和群众也反映说：“抗美援朝时期，不应该这样排场”，有的党员还正式提出过书面意见，但当事人却并未认为这是不对。
    反铺张浪费运动中检查到这个问题时，也遇到了极大的思想抗拒，主持其事的几个干部仍认为这是工作需要，不能算浪费。有的说这是为了“保密”（指新桌子可以上锁）；也有的说这是为了“讲究卫生、减少疾病”；有的竟荒谬地说，按照历史唯物论的观点，一切事物应从其发展上来看：机关要发展，多购置一些家具总有用处。
    物资局党的支部首先在党内批评了“铺张”思想，指出这种思想的滋长，乃是受了资产阶级思想的腐蚀，破坏了艰苦、朴素的革命传统。接着各级领导干部都作了深刻的检讨，有的人已将没有按照制度领来的物品交公。
    反贪污浪费、反官僚主义运动加强了全体工作人员爱护国家财富的观念。在这一运动中由于采用了算细账的办法，使大家认识到工作上每一件细小的疏忽，都可能造成重大的浪费。如轻铁轨因规格不符所造成的损失，足够修建一个仓库。
    物资局除了清理“家底”送交上级，建立工作责任制和精简人员外，又订出了机关节约计划。全局仅停止逾越制度的开支一项，每月即达一千六百余万元，折合粮食二十六吨。另外从烧煤、汽油、办公杂支、水电等各方面精打细算，到今年三月，在经费标准内约可节约二千六百余万元，折合粮食四十二吨。    （东北日报）
