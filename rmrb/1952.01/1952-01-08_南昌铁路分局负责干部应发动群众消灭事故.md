    Responsible Cadres of Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau Should Mobilize the Masses to Eliminate Accidents
    To the Editor: Since the beginning of winter, theft cases have been continuously occurring within the jurisdiction of the Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau. Sabotage incidents and accidents due to negligence have also gradually increased, thereby hindering the smooth completion of transportation tasks. In order to prevent the conspiracies of a few bandits, special agents, and lawless elements, and in order to maintain railway security to welcome the 1952 production increase tasks, I believe that the responsible cadres of the Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau should, in coordination with the public security departments, widely organize the masses, mobilize the masses, carefully inspect safety equipment, implement a safety responsibility system, and thoroughly eliminate all accidents.

    南昌铁路分局负责干部应发动群众消灭事故
    编辑同志：自进入冬季以后，南昌铁路分局辖区内不断地发生窃盗案件，破坏事件和责任事故也逐渐地增多起来，因而阻碍了运输任务的顺利完成。为了防止少数土匪特务和不法分子的阴谋破坏活动，为了维护铁路治安以迎接一九五二年的增产任务，我认为南昌铁路分局负责干部应协同公安部门，广泛地组织群众，发动群众，认真检查安全设备，实施安全负责制，彻底消灭一切事故。
