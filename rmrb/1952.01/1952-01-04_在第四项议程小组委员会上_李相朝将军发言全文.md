Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 3rd. The following is the full text of the speech made by our representative, General Li Sang-cho, at the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee on the 3rd of January during the Korean armistice negotiations:

	Our side resolutely rejects your proposal of January 2nd. In your proposal of January 2nd, you verbally claimed to agree to the principle put forward by our side that all prisoners of war should be released after the signing of the armistice agreement, but you publicly refused to repatriate all prisoners of war after the cessation of hostilities, essentially suggesting an exchange of prisoners of war on a one-to-one basis. In the list of prisoners of war handed over by your side on December 18, 1951, you arbitrarily deducted at least 44,205 of our captured personnel, and you publicly declared that you would detain 16,243 of our captured personnel from the list submitted by your side. In your proposal on January 2nd, you even went a step further and proposed the absurd proposition of exchanging prisoners of war on a one-to-one basis, openly attempting to detain more than 100,000 of our prisoners of war. Such an absurd and unreasonable proposition is absolutely intolerable to our side.

	You should know that the release and repatriation of prisoners of war is not a matter of buying and selling people, and today in the 20th century, it is even less of a barbaric slave era. However, your proposal is precisely placing the release and repatriation of prisoners of war on this barbaric and shameful basis. Your proposal cannot help but make people suspect whether you are truly sincere in achieving the release and repatriation of prisoners of war on both sides.

	It is impossible for any war to have a specific provision that both sides must capture an equal number of prisoners of war, and neither side in a war has any right to demand the exchange of prisoners of war on a one-to-one basis after the armistice, especially since our side has released large numbers of your captured personnel during the war. Under our side's lenient policy towards prisoners of war, large numbers of your captured personnel were safely escorted to the front line and returned to your positions. This fact is known to the world, and even your news media cannot but admit it. Our side is also prepared to provide specific lists and materials as much as possible for these released personnel from your side. What similarities are there between this lenient policy of releasing prisoners during combat and your unreasonable suggestion to refuse to repatriate all prisoners of war under the pretext of so-called voluntary repatriation after the cessation of hostilities, demanding a one-to-one exchange of prisoners, and thus detaining the vast majority of prisoners of war?

	Your proposal of January 2nd not only attempts to detain more than 100,000 of our captured personnel, but also absurdly demands that the soldiers in our army be handed over to your side as prisoners. Your side has once again groundlessly falsely accused our side of forcibly enlisting prisoners of war and civilians into military service. What is the truth? It is your side that is forcibly enlisting prisoners of war and civilians into military service. There is not a single person in our army who has been forced to participate in the war. Indeed, in our ranks, there are insurgents from your side who are unwilling to betray the Korean people. They are awakened Korean patriots. We have never "incorrectly classified" them as prisoners, and we will never hand over these Korean patriots to your side as prisoners to be disposed of by your side.

	What is especially intolerable is that your side has even extended the absurd principle of so-called one-to-one exchange to the release and repatriation of civilians, suggesting the buying and selling of civilians on a one-to-one basis. Our side has clearly pointed out that after the cessation of hostilities, our side will voluntarily repatriate all foreign civilians taken in by our side during the fighting. Our side further maintains that the armistice agreement should stipulate that both sides should provide all displaced civilians during the fighting with all conveniences for returning to their homes. In fact, your side has abducted more than 500,000 civilians during the fighting, and your side has a full responsibility to repatriate these civilians. What reason do you have to propose this absurd and outrageous suggestion of exchanging civilians for prisoners of war on a one-to-one basis?

	Your proposal of January 2nd is not worthy of consideration. Your side's shameful attempt to detain more than 160,000 of our captured personnel under the guise of "voluntary repatriation" and "one-to-one basis" will never succeed. The people of the world will curse your proposal, all the prisoners of war will curse your proposal, and your own captured personnel and their families will also curse your proposal, because your proposal will block the possibility of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war and will block the prospect of a swift armistice agreement.

    在第四项议程小组委员会上
    李相朝将军发言全文
    【新华社开城三日电】朝鲜停战谈判的我方代表李相朝将军在三日第四项议程小组委员会上的发言全文如下：
    我方断然拒绝你方一月二日的提案。你方在一月二日的提案中口头声称同意我方所提出的停战协议签字后释放全体战俘的原则，但你方却公然拒绝在敌对行为终止后遣送全体战俘，实质上建议在一对一的基础上进行战俘的交换。你方在一九五一年十二月十八日交来的战俘名单中，恣意扣除了至少四万四千二百零五名我方被俘人员，你方又公开宣称将扣留你方所交来名单中的一万六千二百四十三名我方被俘人员，而你方在一月二日的提案中，竟更进一步地提出了一对一交换战俘的荒谬的主张，公然企图扣留我方十余万战俘。这种荒谬无理的主张，是我方所绝对不能容忍的。
    你们应该知道战俘的释放与遣送不是人口的买卖，二十世纪的今天更不是野蛮的奴隶时代。但是你们的提案却正把战俘的释放与遣送，放到了这种野蛮和可耻的基础上。你方的提案不能不令人怀疑你方是否确有诚意获致双方战俘的释放与遣送。
    任何战争中都不可能有一定的规定，双方必须俘获同等数目的战俘，交战双方的任何一方更没有任何权利要求在停战后，在一对一的基础上进行战俘的交换，更何况我方在战争的过程中大批地释放了你方被俘人员。在我方对战俘的宽大政策下，大批你方被俘人员被安全地护送到前线，回到了你方的阵地。这种事实是举世皆知的，是你方的新闻报刊也不能不予以承认的。对于这些被释放的你方人员，我方也准备尽可能地提出具体名单和材料，这种在战斗期间释放俘虏的宽大政策，和你方所提出的在敌对行为终止以后，企图假借所谓自愿遣送之名拒绝遣送全体战俘，要求一对一的俘虏交换，因而扣留绝大部分战俘的无理建议，又有什么相同之点呢？
    你方一月二日的提案，不但企图扣留我方十余万名被俘人员，而且更荒谬地要求将我方军队中的战士充当俘虏交给你方。你方又一次毫无根据地诬称我方强编战俘和平民担负军役。事实呢？强编战俘和平民担负军役的正是你方。在我方的军队里找不到一个被强迫参加战争的人员。的确，在我方的队伍里，有着不甘出卖朝鲜人民的你方起义人员，他们是觉悟了的朝鲜的爱国志士，我们从没有把他们“错误地分类”为俘虏，我们也决不会把这些朝鲜的爱国志士充当俘虏送交你方，听凭你方处理。
    尤其不能容忍的，是你方竟将所谓一对一交换的荒谬的原则推广到平民的释放和遣送，建议在一对一的基础上进行平民的买卖。我方已经明确地指出我方将在敌对行为终止以后，主动地遣回所有在战斗期间为我方所收容的外籍平民。我方更主张在停战协议中，应该规定双方给予所有在战斗期间流离失所的平民以一切归还家园的便利。事实上你方在战斗期间掳去了五十万人以上的平民，你方有完全的责任遣还这些平民。你方还有什么理由提出这种在一对一的基础上以平民交换战俘的荒谬绝伦的建议。
    你方一月二日的提案是不能考虑的。你方假借“自愿遣送”、“一对一的基础”的名义以扣留我方十六万余名被俘人员的可耻的企图，将永远不能达到目的。全世界人民将咒诅你方的这一提案，全体的战俘将咒诅你方的提案，你方自己的被俘人员和他们的家属也将咒诅你方的提案，因为你方的这一提案将杜塞释放与遣送全体战俘的可能，将杜塞迅速达成停战协议的前途。
