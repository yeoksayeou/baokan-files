Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 2nd. Our front-line reporter reports: The Chinese People's Volunteers on the Kaesong front and the Imjin River front are greeting 1952 with great confidence and strong will. The Volunteer soldiers guarding the Daeduk Mountain position, nine kilometers northeast of Panmunjom, have been engaged in fierce battles with the Lee Seung-man puppet army for three consecutive days. Their slogan is: "Resolutely defend the Kaesong area and celebrate the New Year with new victories for the people of the motherland!" In the three days of fighting, they killed or wounded more than 800 enemy soldiers. The soldiers of the Third Platoon of the "Iron Ridge Meritorious Company," who were guarding a certain high ground, fought against an enemy battalion and continuously repulsed six enemy attacks. In the fierce battle, commander Su Wenlong forgot the cold of the wind and snow, took off his cotton coat, held his weapon, and led six soldiers in a charge. Yang Huahan was wounded in his right hand. He said, "Even if I only have one hand left, I will give the people of the motherland a New Year's gift!" He then used his left hand to throw grenades and, together with his comrade Wang Youguo, seized an enemy machine gun.

On New Year's Day afternoon, the Korean-Chinese guard troops in the Kaesong area held a group salutation in the central square of Kaesong City, mutually wishing each other new victories in 1952. After the group salutation, the Korean-Chinese people's soldiers held a basketball game. A Yangko team organized by Volunteer soldiers was active in the city, performing street plays they had created. The content of the street play was: if the American aggressors do not accept a fair peace, they will definitely suffer even heavier blows from the Korean and Chinese people.

On New Year's Eve, the soldiers on the Imjin River front held meetings in solid and warm shelters to recall the victories of the past year. On this day last year, the Korean-Chinese People's troops launched a New Year offensive, crossed the Imjin River side by side, and broke through the 38th parallel. The soldiers said: If the American imperialists are still unwilling to give up their aggression and repeatedly delay negotiations, we must hold our guns tightly and continue fighting until the American imperialists are willing to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

Various model units and meritorious individuals have expressed their determination to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and to cherish every gun and bullet. On New Year's Eve, a certain transportation company used the materials from discarded vehicles to rush to assemble a "New Year's Day" truck as a New Year's gift.

On the eve of the New Year, the front-line soldiers received a large number of gifts from the people of the motherland, including pork, fish, flour, and rice, as well as canned food and candy. Various units held sumptuous meals on New Year's Eve and New Year's morning, and also feasted local residents. The meritorious individuals of the guard troops in the Kaesong city area accepted the condolences and flowers from the citizens. Commanders and combatants of a certain unit on the Imjin River front warmly received the New Year's delegation from the Hwanghae Province People's Organization in Korea, who had come from afar to offer condolences.

    【新华社朝鲜前线二日电】本社前线记者报道：开城前线和临津江前线的中国人民志愿军，以高度的信心和坚强的意志迎接一九五二年。守卫在板门店东北九公里大德山阵地上的志愿军战士们，已经和李承晚伪军连续激战了三天。他们的口号是：坚决保卫开城区，用新的胜利向祖国人民贺年！”他们在三天的战斗中，毙伤敌军八百多人。坚守在某高地上的“铁原大功连”第三排的战士们，和一个营的敌人作战，连续打退了敌人的六次进攻。在剧烈的战斗中，指挥员苏文龙忘却风雪的寒冷，脱去棉衣，握着武器，带领六个战士冲锋。杨华汉右手负了伤，他说：“我剩下一只手也要给祖国人民送点新年礼物！”他就用左手投掷手榴弹，和战友王有国一道夺来敌人的一挺机关枪。
    开城区的朝中警卫部队元旦日下午在开城市中央广场举行团拜，互相预祝一九五二年的新的胜利。团拜后，朝中人民战士举行了篮球比赛。志愿军战士组织的秧歌队活跃在市区，表演自己编的街头剧。街头剧的内容是：假如美国侵略者不接受公正的和平，定将遭到朝中人民的更沉重的打击。
    除夕那天，临津江前线的战士们，在坚固温暖的掩蔽部里开会回忆一年来的胜利。在去年今天，朝中人民部队发动新年攻势，并肩强渡临津江，突破三八线。战士们说：如果美帝国主义仍不甘心放弃侵略，一再拖延谈判，我们要握紧枪杆继续战斗，直到美帝国主义愿意和平解决朝鲜问题时为止。
    各模范单位和功臣们纷纷表示坚决执行毛主席的增产节约号召，珍惜一枪一弹。某部运输连在除夕那天，曾用废弃车辆的器材赶装成“元旦号”汽车一辆，作为新年的献礼。
    在新年前夕，前线战士们收到了祖国人民送来的大批礼物，其中有猪肉、鱼、面粉和大米，还有罐头食品和糖果。各单位在除夕的晚上和元旦的早晨举行丰盛的会餐，并宴请当地的居民。开城市区警卫部队的功臣们接受了市民们的慰问和献花。临津江前线的某部指挥员战斗员热烈地接待了远道前来慰问的朝鲜黄海道人民组织的新年慰问团。
