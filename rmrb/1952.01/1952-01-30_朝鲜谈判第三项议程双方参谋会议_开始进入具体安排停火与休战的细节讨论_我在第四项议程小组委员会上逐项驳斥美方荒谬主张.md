Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 29th. The subcommittee on the third agenda of the Korean armistice negotiations decided on the 27th to convene a conference of staff officers from both sides to discuss specific details regarding the third agenda and to draft relevant sections of the armistice agreement. At the staff officers' meeting on the 29th, with regard to the preamble of the armistice agreement and the clauses concerning the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, the opinions of both sides were basically in agreement, except that the specific locations of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone were to be finally determined upon the imminent signing of the agreement. Staff officers from both sides have begun detailed discussions on the specific arrangements for the ceasefire and armistice.
    In the subcommittee on the fourth agenda, our representative refuted item by item the details of the draft armistice agreement concerning the arrangements for prisoners of war put forward by the other side on the 28th. Our representative pointed out that the details suggested by the other side were merely an expansion of the other side's proposal of January 2, which still included the absurd claims that our side absolutely cannot accept, such as "one-for-one exchange," "civilians replacing prisoners of war," and "voluntary repatriation." The details drafted by the other side also put forward the request for the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit prisoner-of-war camps after the signing of the armistice agreement. Our representative pointed out that our commander had clearly stated in his letter to Ridgway on December 24 that, for the convenience of repatriation work on Both Sides, representatives of the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Red Cross Society of the People's Republic of China, together with representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, could form a joint visiting group, set off in groups to conduct on-the-spot visits to prisoner-of-war camps on both sides, and assist in repatriation work at the prisoner-of-war handover points on both sides after the signing and entry into force of the armistice agreement.

    朝鲜谈判第三项议程双方参谋会议
    开始进入具体安排停火与休战的细节讨论
    我在第四项议程小组委员会上逐项驳斥美方荒谬主张
    【新华社开城二十九日电】二十七日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会决定召开双方参谋会议，讨论有关第三项议程的具体细节问题，并拟定停战协定中有关部分的草案。二十九日双方参谋会议上，对于停战协定的序言，以及有关军事分界线与非军事区的条款，除军事分界线与非军事区的具体位置仍有待协议即将签字时作最后确定外，双方意见已臻一致。双方参谋人员已开始进入停火与休战的具体安排的细节讨论。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表逐项地驳斥了对方在二十八日所提出的停战协定草案中有关战俘安排的细节。我方代表指出对方所建议的细节，只是对方一月二日提案的扩充，其中仍然包括了我方所绝对不能接受的“一对一的交换”，“平民顶替战俘”，以及“志愿遣送”等荒谬主张。对方所拟定的细节中，又提出了红十字国际委员会在停战协定签字后，访问战俘营的要求。我方代表指出我方司令官早在十二月二十四日致李奇微函中明确表明，为了双方遣俘工作便利起见，停战协议签字并生效后，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国及中华人民共和国红十字会代表，即可会同红十字国际委员会的代表，组成联合访问团，分组出发到双方战俘营进行就地访问，并可在双方战俘交接地点协助遣俘工作。
