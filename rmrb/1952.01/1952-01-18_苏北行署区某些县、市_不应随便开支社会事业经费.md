    Certain Counties and Cities in the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Region
    Should Not Casually Spend Social Welfare Funds

    To the Editor: Recently, within the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Region, we discovered that many departments are casually spending social welfare funds and failing to use dedicated funds for dedicated purposes. For example, the Nantong Special District Civil Affairs Section transferred more than 160 million yuan from the children's education funds of various counties, 39 million yuan from social welfare funds, and a portion of social mutual aid grain directly raised, to repair houses and purchase furniture for veteran schools and convalescent hospitals. Rugao County used preferential grain equivalent to 50 million yuan to invest in a cinema. Qingjiang City took 11 million yuan from social welfare expenses and the surplus from the Yangqing Highway construction funds to renovate theater buildings. Huaiyin County used 150,000 jin of relief grain to invest in a vegetable oil factory. When Chen, the head of the Civil Affairs Section of Huaiyin County, was transferred, he spent 160,000 yuan on photography fees and 54,000 yuan on pillows and handbags, all of which were charged to social welfare funds.

    The main reason for the casual spending is that the financial departments managing social welfare funds in various places fail to implement the budget and final accounting system and even take the lead in undermining the system. Some counties only emphasize solving practical difficulties while ignoring the importance of using dedicated funds for dedicated purposes. I suggest that supervisory authorities at all levels pay attention to this issue and give appropriate criticism and punishment to personnel who violate financial discipline. Leaders at all levels should also strengthen the management of social welfare funds in the future.　Hu Shengzu

### 苏北行署区某些县、市  不应随便开支社会事业经费

    苏北行署区某些县、市
    不应随便开支社会事业经费
    编辑同志：最近我们在苏北行署区内，发现很多部门随便开支社会事业经费，不能专款专用。例如：南通专署民政科抽调各县子女教育费一亿六千多万元、社会福利基金三千九百多万元和直接劝募的社会互济粮一部，移作荣誉军人学校和康复医院修理房屋、购置家具用。如皋县动用优抚粮折合五千万元，向电影院投资。清江市在社会事业费用内和修建扬清公路经费结余内，拿出一千一百万元，翻盖戏院房屋。淮阴县动用救济粮十五万斤投入植物油厂。淮阴县民政科长陈某调动工作时，用照相费十六万元，买枕头、手提包用五万四千元，也都在社会事业经费内开支。
    造成随便开支的主要原因，是各地管理社会事业经费的财政部门不能执行预决算制度，甚至带头破坏制度。有些县只强调要解决实际困难，而忽视了专款专用的重要意义。我建议各级监察机关重视这一问题，对违反财政纪律的人员，给以应有的批评和处分。各级领导也应加强对今后社会事业经费的管理。　胡绳祖
