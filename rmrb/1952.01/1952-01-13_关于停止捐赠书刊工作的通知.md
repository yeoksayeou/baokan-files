    Notice Regarding the Cessation of Book and Publication Donations
    In August of last year, this publication called on readers to provide the Volunteer Army with spiritual sustenance to meet their needs for political and cultural learning. This call was met with enthusiastic responses from readers across the country, who donated various books and publications. This demonstrates the boundless love and concern of the people of the motherland for our Volunteer Army.
    Recently, this publication received a letter from the Political Department of the Volunteer Army stating: The Volunteer Army expresses its extreme gratitude for the concern of the people of the motherland after receiving the books and newspapers sent by them. They also stated that they would respond to the people of the motherland with even more heroic struggles. However, the letter also stated: Some of the books and publications donated by various regions are not entirely suitable for the needs of the Volunteer Army comrades. Secondly, after classification, the quantity of each type varies, making distribution inconvenient. Finally, because the books, publications, and newspapers donated by various regions must be centralized first and accumulated to a considerable quantity before being shipped to the front lines, the periodicals and newspapers donated by various regions often lose their timeliness. Based on this situation, the Political Department of the Volunteer Army suggested that in the future, all kinds of books and newspapers needed by the Volunteer Army should be uniformly ordered and transported by the China Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, because this can overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings and avoid waste. The China Resist America, Aid Korea General Association has decided to accept this suggestion from the Political Department of the Volunteer Army. It is hoped that readers in various regions will immediately cease the work of donating books and publications to the Volunteer Army.

    关于停止捐赠书刊工作的通知
    去年八月，本刊曾号召读者多多把精神食粮供给志愿军，以满足志愿军学习政治、文化的需要。这个号召，获得各地读者热烈响应，纷纷捐赠了各种书刊。这说明了祖国人民对我们志愿军的无限热爱和关怀。
    最近本刊接到志愿军政治部来信说：志愿军接到祖国人民寄赠的书报后，对祖国人民的关怀极表感谢。他们并表示将以更英勇的斗争来回答祖国人民。但来信又说：各地所捐赠的书刊，仍有一些不完全适合志愿军同志的需要。其次是分类后每种数量多少不一，分配起来很感不便。最后，由于各地所捐赠的书刊及报纸，须先行集中，积累到相当数量时才能往前线启运，这样就使各地捐赠的期刊和报纸往往失了时间性。根据这种情况，志愿军政治部建议：今后凡是志愿军所需要的各种书报，均由抗美援朝总会统一订购，统一运送，因为这样可以克服上述各种缺点，避免浪费。抗美援朝总会已决定接受志愿军政治部这个建议。希望各地读者即停止捐赠书刊给志愿军的工作。
