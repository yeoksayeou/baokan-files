	Two Shoddily Made Maps of Vietnam
	To the Editor: To understand the battle situation of our close ally and comrade-in-arms, the Vietnamese people, we urgently need a detailed and accurate map of Vietnam. However, so far, the most detailed maps of Vietnam I have seen are the "New Map of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam" published by Yaguang Cartography Society and the "Complete Map of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam" published by Tianjin Fuxing Cartography Society. I compared these two maps with Vietnamese maps and found that they both have serious errors.

	First, I believe that the "Complete Map of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam" was drawn according to the "New Map of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam." For example, if the latter mistranslates a place name, the former follows suit; if the latter draws a road or railway incorrectly, the former also draws it incorrectly. Such a style of blindly copying is absolutely unacceptable. The second is the issue of translating Vietnamese place names into Chinese. Correctly translating Vietnamese place names does have many difficulties; however, one thing is certain, and that is that we must absolutely not translate them based on English or French phonetic spellings. The above two maps have both taken this wrong path. Except for a few place names that are frequently seen in newspapers and magazines and are common knowledge, the rest have been translated into a complete mess. Just taking the names of the provinces in northern Vietnam, which we are most familiar with, eight of the twenty-six province names in northern Vietnam are translated incorrectly. Furthermore, of the fourteen province names within Cambodia, all except "Kratie" and "Kampot" are translated incorrectly. There are also serious errors regarding railways, highways, etc. For example, a railway that has not yet opened (from Saigon to Phnom Penh in Cambodia) is drawn as open, while a highway that has already opened (such as Highway 13—from Vientiane to Saigon) is drawn as incomplete. The national borders are also drawn incorrectly. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia are three independent countries, but the "New Map of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam" divides the three countries with administrative boundary symbols, which is an even more serious political error.

	Now, 37,000 copies of the "New Map of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam" have been printed, and the "Complete Map of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam" is still being sold on the market, which has a considerable negative impact on the people. I hope the mapmakers will pay attention to correcting these errors. Zhang Jun

### 两幅粗制滥造的越南地图

    两幅粗制滥造的越南地图
    编辑同志：为了解我们的亲密友邦和战友——越南人民的战斗形势，我们迫切需要一幅详细而又正确的越南地图。但是到目前为止，我所看到的较详细的越南地图，只有亚光舆地学社出版的“越南民主共和国新地图”和天津复兴舆地学社出版的“越南民主共和国全图”。我把这两种地图和越南文地图对照了一下，发现其中都有严重的错误。
    首先，我认为“越南民主共和国全图”是依照“越南民主共和国新地图”绘制的。如后者地名译错前者也就跟着译错了；后者公路铁路画错了，前者也跟着画错了。像这样盲目抄袭的作风，是绝对要不得的。其次是越南地名的汉译问题。正确地翻译越南地名，固有很多困难；不过有一点是可以肯定的，那就是绝对不能根据英文或法文的拼音翻译。以上两种地图却都走了这一错误的道路。其中除经常在报纸杂志上见到的属于常识范围内的几个地名外，其余都被译得一塌糊涂。只拿我们最熟悉的越南北部的省名来说，在越南北部二十六个省名中，就有八个译错了。又如在柬埔寨境内十四个省名中，除“桔井”、“唝吥”没有译错外，其余的也全译错了。关于铁路、公路线等，也有严重的错误。如把还没有通车的铁路（从西贡到柬埔寨的金边——即百囊奔）画通了，而早已通车的公路线（如第十三号公路——从万象到西贡）却画成没有完成。国界画得也不对。越南民主共和国、老挝、柬埔寨是三个独立国家，但“越南民主共和国新地图”却把三国用部界符号划分，这更是一个严重的政治错误。
    现在“越南民主共和国新地图”已印制了三万七千幅，“越南民主共和国全图”也还在市上销售，这在人民中间所散布的错误影响是不小的。希望绘制者注意修正。张钧
