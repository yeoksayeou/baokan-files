    Important Correction
    In the article "Introduction to the New Edition of Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party" published on page 3 of this newspaper on December 28, 1951, the sentence "The new edition contains some revisions to the first edition, so the number of pages has increased by seventeen compared to the first edition" should be deleted. This is because the increase of seventeen pages in the new edition is due to the widened line spacing on each page.

    重要更正
    一九五一年十二月二十八日本报第三版刊载的“介绍中国共产党的三十年的新版本”一文第一段中“新版本包含一些对于初版本的修正，所以篇幅较初版本增加了十七页”一句应删去。因为新版本篇幅增加十七页是由于每页行距加宽的缘故。
