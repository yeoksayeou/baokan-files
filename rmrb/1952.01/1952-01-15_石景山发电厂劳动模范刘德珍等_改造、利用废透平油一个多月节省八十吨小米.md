    Labor Model Liu Dezhen and Others from Shijingshan Power Plant
    Save Eighty Tons of Millet in Just Over a Month by Renovating and Utilizing Waste Turbine Oil
    Editor: Labor model Liu Dezhen and others from Shijingshan Power Plant used sulfuric acid-clay fractional treatment method to renovate and utilize waste turbine oil, creating the wealth of eighty tons of millet for the country. In North China, turbine oil that has been used in power plants for a long time becomes unusable once the acid value is too high (indicating the oil quality has deteriorated). Shijingshan Power Plant used to use thirty large barrels of turbine oil every year, which was a great waste. In June of last year, Liu Dezhen proposed to the plant leaders to use clay to test the waste turbine oil and make it useful from unusable. He also included this plan in the group's patriotic pact, requiring the revival of forty large barrels of waste turbine oil. In October, clay was shipped from the Northeast, and Liu Dezhen's group and two technicians from the General Administration of Electricity Management began testing. During the experiment, they overcame many difficulties. For example, they found that the speed of the mixer was too slow, only 75 revolutions per minute, which could not bring into play the effect of clay in the oil. So, they used an electric drill instead, increasing the speed to 170 revolutions per minute and utilizing the effect of clay; they also used a large scale instead of a small scale, which reduced the time for measuring clay by half. After this experiment, the oil quality became very good, but it still could not maintain normal quality, and the output was too small. Therefore, Liu Dezhen and the two technicians from the General Administration of Electricity Management continued their research. According to the composition of the waste turbine oil, they used sulfuric acid-clay fractional treatment method, appropriately adjusting the ratio of sulfuric acid and clay, so that the output increased to more than one large barrel per day, and the quality also exceeded the standard. From November 20th of last year to now, Liu Dezhen's group has completed sixty-five large barrels, saving the country eighty tons of millet.

    石景山发电厂劳动模范刘德珍等
    改造、利用废透平油一个多月节省八十吨小米
    编辑同志：石景山发电厂劳动模范刘德珍等，用硫酸白土分段处理法，改造、利用废透平油，为国家创造了八十吨小米的财富。华北各地发电厂使用日久的透平油，酸价一高（表示油质坏了），就不能用了。石景山发电厂每年要用三十大桶透平油，这就要浪费很多。去年六月，刘德珍向厂里领导干部提出，要用白土子来试验废透平油，使它由不能用变成有用。他并把这个计划订到小组爱国公约里去，要求复活废透平油四十大桶。十月份，从东北运来白土子，刘德珍小组工人和电业管理总局的两个技术人员，开始进行试验工作。在试验过程中，他们克服了很多困难。比如大家发现绞拌器速度太慢，每分钟七十五转，不能发挥白土子在油中的作用，他们就用电钻来代替，使速度达到一百七十转，发挥了白土子的作用；他们更用大磅秤代替小磅秤，缩短了一半量白土子的时间。经过这种试验后，油质变得很好，但还不能保持正常的质量，产量也是太小。于是，刘德珍和电业管理总局两个技术人员又继续研究，他们按废透平油的成分，用硫酸白土分段处理法，适当地调整了硫酸和白土子的比例，使产量提高到日产一大桶多，质量也超过了标准。从去年十一月二十日到现在，刘德珍小组已完成了六十五大桶，给国家节省了八十吨小米。
