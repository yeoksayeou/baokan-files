    Literary and Art Circles Should Actively Participate in the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement

    Editor: After reading the report in the Nanjing Xinhua Daily on December 16th about the extravagance and waste within the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, I realized that the waste phenomenon in literary and art departments is serious. From August of the year before last to August of last year, when the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Nanjing Cultural Troupe was building the "Nanjing Auditorium," the budget was increased four times, totaling over 2.74 billion yuan of state funds. The leaders of the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles conducted a review of this matter, but while conducting the review, they also established an "Arts Club," spending over 23.88 million yuan in cultural operating expenses. The establishment of the "Arts Club" was not aimed at uniting the broad masses of literary and art workers to engage earnestly in literary and artistic creation and ideological education, but rather at focusing on "sophisticated equipment," "lavish displays," and "elegant installations" to "attract" literary and art workers. Leading cadres of the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles led some comrades by car to the Confucius Temple to collectively select a batch of antique-style bronze-colored teapots and teacups, some of which were only as small as the smallest wine glasses. Some comrades said: "'Entering the Arts Club' is like entering an antique shop, a furniture store, and an art exhibition, and one cannot see any direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants and soldiers." Others said: "Entering here is like returning to 500 years ago." Not many literary and art workers frequently come to the "Arts Club."

    After reading this report, I feel that the erroneous idea of some people that "literary and art departments are not financial departments, so there will not be much waste" should be thoroughly criticized. I believe that the literary and art circles should not only participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement without exception while carrying out literary and art rectification and study, thoroughly exposing the corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in literary and art work, but also literary and art workers should actively create literary and artistic works on this theme, encouraging the masses to actively participate in this movement, so that this great struggle can achieve a complete victory!

### 文艺界应积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动

     文艺界应积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动
    编辑同志：我看了去年十二月十六日南京新华日报上登的南京市文学艺术界联合会铺张浪费现象的报道后，认识到文艺工作部门的浪费现象是严重的。从前年八月到去年八月，南京市文学艺术界联合会所属南京文工团兴建“南京会堂”时，先后追加预算四次，共计支出国家资金二十七亿四千三百多万元。南京市文学艺术界联合会的领导人员曾对这件事进行检讨，但在进行检讨的同时，又建立了一个“文艺俱乐部”。支出文化事业费二千三百八十八万多元。建立“文艺俱乐部”，并非从团结广大文艺工作者认真从事文艺创作和进行思想教育着眼，而是处处考虑“设备讲究”“摆设排场”“装置风雅”，以“招徕”文艺工作者。南京市文学艺术界联合会领导干部，曾率领一些同志，乘汽车到夫子庙，集体挑选了一批古色古香的紫铜色的茶壶茶杯，有些茶杯只有最小的酒杯那样大。有的同志说：“‘进文艺俱乐部’像进了古董店、木器行和图画展览室，一点工农兵的文艺方向都看不出来”，有的说：“一进来像回到五百年前一样”。经常来“文艺俱乐部”的文艺工作者并不多。
    看了这个报道后，我觉得对于某些人的“文艺部门不是财经部门，不会有什么大浪费”的错误想法，应加以彻底批判。我认为文艺界不但应在文艺整风学习的同时，毫无例外地参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，彻底揭发文艺工作方面的贪污、浪费和官僚主义的现象，而且文艺工作者要积极地创作有关这一主题的文艺作品，鼓动群众积极参加这个运动，使这一伟大斗争获得彻底胜利！
