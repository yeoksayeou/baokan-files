Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Kaesong, January 15th: This reporter reports: 朝中 representatives here pointed out: The unreasonable demand made by the US side to restrict the construction of airports and infringe upon North Korean sovereignty has become a serious obstacle determining the success or failure of the armistice negotiations that have lasted for more than six months. The Panmunjom armistice negotiations have reached a stage where an agreement can be reached at any time as long as the US representatives abandon their unreasonable demands. If the US still vainly attempts to restrict the right of the Korean people to build airports necessary to resist aggression in any way, it will only make the negotiations fall into a more serious deadlock.

The US representatives once again refused to take decisive steps to seek an agreement on the third agenda item. The reason why the last agreement on the military demarcation line was delayed was because the US representatives refused to determine the demarcation line stipulated in the agenda at the last moment. This time, they once again put forward the unreasonable demand that the Korean people are not allowed to increase their defensive equipment in order to obstruct the armistice negotiations.

It is pointed out here: The question now is whether the US representatives intend to stick to this demand, and risk delaying the negotiations to the point of endangering the prospect of an early armistice in Korea. If the US still insists on this demand, it will only make the world realize that the US representatives are not negotiating on an equal footing, but are once again acting as victors, using "security" as an excuse to force the 朝中 side to accept their unacceptable demands.

Last July, they used similar excuses to demand 12,000 square kilometers of land in northern Korea. They did not achieve this goal, so the negotiations were interrupted for two months. Last November, they used "Seoul is threatened" and "defending Seoul" as excuses to demand Kaesong. World public opinion forced them to abandon this unreasonable demand. Now they are using "security" as an excuse to demand restrictions on the construction of airports.

The US representatives have refused to discuss major issues concerning a stable and effective armistice more than once. They have refused to discuss the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, which is an effective guarantee to prevent the recurrence of war. They refuse to agree to reduce troops or strictly prohibit troops, weapons and ammunition from entering Korea. They insist that the rotation of troops and replenishment of equipment is not a matter for negotiation.

In order to speed up the reaching of an agreement, the 朝中 representatives have agreed to the other party's request for necessary replacement of war equipment during the armistice within a reasonable range.

Now both sides have reached an agreement on all the most basic conditions necessary to achieve an effective and stable armistice. During the armistice, no reinforcements of troops or war equipment, including combat aircraft, shall enter Korea. Complying with this principle will indeed prevent the air force from being greatly strengthened during the armistice. Both sides also agreed to have neutral groups inspect both sides' rear areas to supervise the implementation of this principle.

The US negotiators' sincerity in achieving an armistice in Korea is now being tested again. The test is whether they remove the serious obstacles they have set up to obstruct the agreement on the third agenda item. All those who hope for an early armistice in Korea are waiting for them to take this step. If they do not take this decisive step, they must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

### 新华社记者报道  美方限制修建机场无理要求是朝鲜停战谈判的严重障碍

    美方限制修建机场无理要求是朝鲜停战谈判的严重障碍
    【新华社开城十五日电】本社记者报道：此间朝中代表指出：美方所提出的限制修建机场、侵犯朝鲜主权的无理要求，已变成决定历时六个多月的停战谈判成败的严重障碍。板门店停战谈判又到达这样的阶段，就是只要美方代表放弃他们的无理要求，双方就可以随时达成协议。如果美方依然妄想以任何方式限制朝鲜人民修筑为抵御侵略所必需的飞机场的权利，那只会使谈判陷入更严重的僵局。
    美方代表又一次拒绝采取决定性的步骤，来寻求第三项议程的协议。上次关于军事分界线的协议之所以迟迟没有达成，是因为美方代表在最后一刻拒绝确定议程所规定的分界线。这一次他们又提出不许朝鲜人民增加防御设备的无理要求，以阻挠停战谈判。
    此间指出：现在的问题是美方代表是否打算坚持这种要求，不惜拖延谈判以至危及在朝鲜早日停战的前途。如果美方仍然坚持这种要求，那只会使全世界认识美方代表不是以平等地位进行谈判，而是又以胜利者自居，用“安全”做藉口强迫朝中方面接受他们的不可接受的要求。
    去年七月，他们曾用类似的藉口要求取得朝鲜北部的一万二千平方公里的土地。他们没有达到这种目的，于是使谈判曾中断两个月之久。去年十一月，他们用“汉城受到威胁”和“保卫汉城”做藉口要求取得开城。全世界舆论迫使他们放弃了这种无理要求。现在他们用“安全”做藉口要求限制修建机场。
    美方代表曾不止一次地拒绝讨论关于稳定而有效的停战的重大问题，他们拒绝讨论外国军队撤出朝鲜的问题，而这却是防止战事再起的有效保证。他们拒绝同意裁减军队或严格禁止军队、武器和弹药进入朝鲜的问题。他们硬说轮换军队和补充装备不是一个需要谈判的问题。
    为了加速达成协议，朝中代表已在合理范围内同意了对方在停战期间进行必要的战争装备的替换的要求。
    现在双方对于达成一个有效而稳定的停战所需的一切最起码的条件已经取得协议。在停战期间，一切增援的军队和包括战斗飞机在内的战争装备都不得进入朝鲜。遵守这个原则就会确实防止空军力量在停战期间大大加强。双方并且同意由中立小组在双方的后方进行视察以监督这个原则的执行。
    美方谈判代表对于在朝鲜实现停战究竟有无诚意，现在再度受到考验。这个考验就是看他们是否移去他们所布下的阻挠第三项议程获得协议的严重障碍。所有希望朝鲜早日停战的人们都在等待他们采取这个步骤。他们如不采取这个决定性的步骤，就必须对由此产生的全部后果负完全的责任。
