    Shortens Time for Funds to be Deposited After Studying Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste Documents
    Editor: In the past month, we have focused on studying documents related to the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, reversing the erroneous thinking of some comrades who believed that because they were working at their desks, they would not be involved in corruption and waste. We have initially examined the serious losses caused to the state due to the backlog of funds. Take the slow remittance of funds from gold treasuries at all levels as an example: in the past, it took at least five days to remit funds into the treasury. Based on an average daily deposit of 200 million yuan, with a monthly interest rate of one percent, the annual loss was considerable. After studying, everyone proposed improvement methods: starting this year, the special district gold treasury institutions will be abolished, and the county sub-treasuries will directly report to the provincial branch treasury; in the use of office stationery, after careful calculation by everyone, we can claim half less than the original standard.

    学习反贪污浪费文件后缩短款项入库时间
    编辑同志：最近一个月来，我们着重地学习了有关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的文件，扭转了某些同志认为自己是爬在桌子上办公的人，不会有贪污浪费行为的错误想法。我们已经初步地检查了由于积压资金，给国家造成的严重损失。拿各级金库款项上解迟缓为例：过去入库款，至少要五天才能报解。按每天平均入库两亿元，月息一分计算，每年的损失相当可观。经过学习，大家提出了改进方法：从今年起，撤销专区金库机构，而由各县支库直接报解省分库；在办公文具的使用上，经过大家精打细算，可以按原定标准少领一半。
