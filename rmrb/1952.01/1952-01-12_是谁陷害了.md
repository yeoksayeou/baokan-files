Who Framed Me
Jin Zhaoyi, Clerk of the Business Section of Zhenhua Printing Factory

I sincerely thank the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. The great political movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy saved me.

I grew up in Beijing. My family consists of only my mother and sister, and we lived on dividend income. In April 1949, the day after I graduated from Senior Commercial School, I was fortunate enough to join the state-owned Zhenhua Printing Factory. At that time, my mother happily told me, "Work hard and don't be mischievous." After I joined the factory, I initially worked in materials management, and in the second half of 1950, I switched to business work. I started with enthusiasm and diligence, and the work went smoothly. The leadership was also satisfied with my work. However, my arrogant and complacent attitude quickly developed, and I was unwilling to participate in trade union work and all extracurricular political activities, which made me even more politically backward.

At the beginning of last year, I went to the privately-owned Jinhua Plate Making Bureau, and the bureau's salesman, Zhang Mingxing, insisted on inviting me to dinner. At first, I was afraid of being criticized and didn't want to go. After he repeatedly insisted, I changed my mind: "One meal is nothing, the leadership won't know." Thus, I had my first bribery meal. In February of that year, I went to the privately-owned Wenfu Tang Bookbinding Bureau. The manager of this bureau, Sun Xuechen, was always very attentive to me. When he saw me, he first said a series of flattering words such as, "Comrade Jin is really nice, young but very capable." Then he brought up, "I like to make friends. Let's have a couple of drinks today, brothers!" I said I wouldn't go, but I hesitated in my heart and continued to sit there smoking. He immediately changed the subject: "Forget it then. I see you're really tired all day long, your health isn't good, and your salary is low. If you need money in the future, come to me. We're brothers, and I can help!" He immediately took out 200,000 yuan. At that time, I thought, "I can't commit bribery and break the law." But Sun Xuechen said very generously, "Don't be afraid, it's okay, no one will know. This is the friendship between us brothers, who cares about a few tens of thousands? Since the money is out, wouldn't it be embarrassing for me, Old Sun, if you don't take it?" At that time, I thought, "The leadership won't know," so I accepted this bribe. Another time, when I was leaving the Jinhua Plate Making Bureau and reached the door, Zhang Mingxing put a small white paper packet in my pocket and said, "Just a little something, take it! Come and sit here often in the future!" He also pushed me a bit, not letting me refuse. I walked out of the street and opened the paper packet. It was 40,000 yuan in Renminbi. Until this movement began, I had successively accepted bribes totaling 740,000 yuan, received kickbacks of 110,000 yuan, and borrowed 60,000 yuan from the Wenfu Tang Bookbinding Bureau, Jinhua Plate Making Bureau, and Xinsheng Printing Bureau.

In the past, I inspected the goods sent by private merchants strictly and carefully. But "if you eat someone's food, you'll be soft-spoken; if you take someone's money, you'll be lenient." After I accepted bribes from private merchants, when they came to deliver goods again, I was too embarrassed to carefully check the specifications, quality, or timeliness. This caused a lot of losses to the public. My own life also changed. I didn't dare to spend the bribe money openly, so I secretly went to small restaurants, smoked cigarettes, ate snacks, and secretly left the bicycle that the factory gave me to ride at a bicycle shop, and hired a pedicab instead.

When the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy first began, after listening to the leadership's report, a struggle arose in my own mind. If I confessed, everything was good in the past, and this would be very embarrassing; besides, I would be letting down Sun Xuechen and the others. So I took a break to find Sun Xuechen of Wenfu Tang Bookbinding Bureau to discuss it. He flatly insisted that I not confess. He said, "If you confess, how will your factory do business with me! Besides, I, Old Sun, am a piece of 'white jade,' and it'll be over if I confess! It's okay if you don't confess. If they come to ask, I definitely won't say anything. I, Old Sun, would take a knife for a friend. I don't care about sitting in jail for half a year!" Seeing that he was so determined, I gave up the idea of confessing and made an agreement with him that "no one would confess." After two or three days, the leadership gave another mobilization report, calling on those who sincerely regretted their mistakes to confess. At this time, my conscience was reproaching me again, but I was also afraid of offending Sun Xuechen. I only confessed to the leadership about the Jinhua Plate Making Bureau, and about Sun Xuechen giving me a bribe, I only said that he invited me to a meal. After confessing, the leadership encouraged me and said, "It's good to confess the problem and seriously correct it." At the same time, it pointed out that if there were any other problems, I should confess them thoroughly. That night, I didn't sleep well all night, and my mental burden became heavier. The next day, I took another break to find Sun Xuechen to discuss it. Unexpectedly, as soon as I entered the door, he said first, "Yesterday, people from the factory came to investigate, and I told them everything about us!" I immediately ran back to the factory and told the leadership all the facts of the bribery in one breath, and requested punishment. The leadership, considering my naivety and ignorance, wanted me to recognize my mistakes and exempted me from punishment.

After my mother found out about this, she severely scolded me; my younger sister, a Young Pioneer, was so angry about my shameful behavior that she cried bitterly and wanted to break off the brother-sister relationship with me. I also felt ashamed to face people. However, our factory director took time out of his busy schedule to go to my home to explain to my family, saying that confessing and admitting mistakes was the right thing to do, and that they should not punish me excessively, and that they should help me make progress in the future.

This movement made me realize that only the Communist Party is my family. If Chairman Mao hadn't put forward the anti-corruption movement, I simply wouldn't have known what path I was going to take. Now I know how dangerous the path I took in the past was! Revolutionary comrades are my true good friends. In the future, I will resolutely correct my mistakes and atone for my sins by making contributions in my work, in order to repay the leadership and comrades for their care and education.

    是谁陷害了我
    振华印刷厂业务科科员　金兆义
    我衷心感谢毛主席的英明领导。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大政治运动挽救了我。
    我生长在北京，家里只有母亲和妹妹，靠股金红利过日子。一九四九年四月，我走出高级商业学校大门的第二天，就幸运地参加了公营振华印刷厂的工作。当时妈妈曾高兴地嘱咐我：“要好好干，不要调皮。”我进厂后起初作材料保管工作，一九五○年下半年改作业务工作。自己在工作中开始是热情的，努力的，工作很顺当，领导方面对自己的工作也满意。但是我高傲自满的情绪很快发展起来，不愿参加工会工作和一切业余政治活动，这就使自己在政治上更加落后。
    去年年初，有一次到私营金华制版局去，这局的业务员张名兴硬要请我吃饭。我先是怕受批评，不去；经他一让再让，自己就变了想法：“吃一顿没什么，领导上不会知道。”这样便吃了第一顿受贿饭。这年二月，我到私营文富堂装订局去。这局的经理孙学臣一贯对我很殷勤。他见我先说了一套“金同志人真不错，年岁不大，能力不小”的好听话，接着提出来：“我这个人好交朋友，今天咱哥俩喝两杯！”我口里说不去，心里在犹豫，仍坐在那里吸烟。他立刻转了个题：“不去算了；我看你一天到晚真够累，身体又不好，薪金又低，以后要用钱找我，咱哥俩没关系，办得到！”即刻拿出二十万元来。当时我想“可不敢犯法受贿”。孙学臣却非常慷慨似地说：“不要怕，没关系，别人不知道。这是哥俩的交情，谁花谁几万没什么。钱既拿出来了，你不收不是给我老孙不好看吗？……”当时我想“领导上不会知道”，我就接受了这次贿赂。又一次，当我离开金华制版局走到门口时，张名兴把一个小白纸包放到我的口袋里，并说：“小意思，带着吧！以后常来这儿坐呀！”还推了我一把，让我不要拒绝。我走出街口打开纸包，是四万元人民币。一直到这次运动开始前，我先后在文富堂装订局、金华制版局、新生印刷局三处共受贿七十四万元，吃回扣十一万元，在永新装订局借款六万元。
    过去我对私商送来的货，检查得严格认真。“吃了人家的嘴软，拿了人家的手短。”我受了私商的贿赂后，他们再来交货时，规格、质量、时间早晚，就不好意思认真检查了。这样就使公家受了不少损失。自己生活也变了。受来贿赂钱不敢明着花，便偷偷地下小馆、吸纸烟、吃零食，把工厂给自己骑的自行车偷偷放在车子铺，另外雇三轮车坐。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动刚开始，我听了领导方面的报告，自己思想上就起了斗争。谈了吧，过去样样好，这一来多丢脸；再说也对不起孙学臣他们。我就抽个空子去找文富堂装订局的孙学臣商量。他一口咬定不要我谈，他说：“你谈了，你们厂的活我还怎么做呀！再说，我老孙是一块‘白玉’，谈了就完了！不谈没关系，他们来问，我一定不说。我老孙为朋友两肋扎刀，坐半年牢不在乎！”我见他这么坚决，就打消了坦白的念头，和他定好了“谁也不谈”的条约。过了两三天，领导方面又作动员报告，号召真心悔过的人坦白。这时良心又责备着自己，可是又怕得罪孙学臣。我只向领导方面坦白了金华制版局的事，对孙学臣给贿赂的事，只说他请吃了一顿饭。谈了后，领导方面鼓励我说：“问题谈出来认真改正就好。”同时指出：如还有什么问题，要彻底坦白。当天晚上我整夜没睡好，思想包袱更加沉重了。第二天，我又抽空去找孙学臣商量，不料一进门，他却先说：“昨天工厂来人调查，我把咱们那事都谈了！”我立刻跑回工厂，一口气把所有的受贿事实都向领导方面说出来，并请求处分。领导方面念我幼稚无知，要我好好认识错误，免掉对我的处分。
    我母亲知道这事后，她严厉责骂我；我的小妹妹，一个少年儿童队员，因我的可耻行为气愤得痛哭，要和我断绝兄妹关系。我也觉着无脸见人。可是我们的厂长却在百忙中抽空到我家去向我的亲人们解释，说坦白认错是对的，要他们不要过分责罚我，要他们今后帮助我进步。
    这一运动使我认识到只有共产党才是自己的亲人，如果没有毛主席提出反贪污运动，我简直不知道要走到什么道路上去，我现在才知道我过去走的路是多么危险的一条路呀！革命同志才是自己真正的好朋友。今后我坚决改正错误，在工作中立功赎罪，来答谢领导方面和同志们对我的爱护和教育。（新华社）
