    Model of Hard Work, Simplicity, Integrity, and Public Service—Liu Changlu
    By Ren Qianqiao, Sun Hanchun, Zhao Wenwei, Gong Mei, Chen Qi, Peng Bin
    (Seven) When merchants failed to entice Liu Changlu with profits, they often complained to him, requesting to buy substandard goods or reduce the amount of materials. However, Liu Changlu always insisted on adhering to the contract. The merchant then threatened him basely, saying, "If you don't listen to my opinion, we won't be able to complete your construction plan on schedule." Liu Changlu told him, "We will resolutely act according to the contract; for each day you are late, you will pay a penalty of five million yuan!"
    (Eight) Seeing that threatening him didn't work, the merchant tried another method, asking Liu Changlu for some wood scraps and drill shavings. After Liu Changlu sought and obtained approval from his superiors, he allowed the merchant to take some wood scraps and drill shavings. However, while loading the truck, the merchant also stole some lumber, which was discovered by Liu Changlu. Liu Changlu sternly criticized the merchant. Because Liu Changlu paid attention to constantly fighting against the merchant's inferior character in thought and action, the construction task was finally completed on schedule and to full satisfaction according to the contract.
    (Nine) Liu Changlu not only consistently maintained the excellent traditions of a Communist Party member of hard work, simplicity, integrity, and public service, but also achieved significant savings. Starting in January 1951, when he was responsible for the construction of the East China Public Security Cadre School's buildings, he often forgot to eat, running around tirelessly, never complaining of being tired, and investigating market prices everywhere in order to save expenses.

    （七）商人见利诱不成，就常向刘长禄叫苦，要求买次货，或少买材料。但是刘长禄始终坚持照合同办理。那商人又卑劣地威胁他说：“不听我的意见，我们就不能如期完成你们的修建计划。”刘长禄就告诉他：“我们坚决照合同办事，迟一天你就赔偿五百万元！”
    （八）那商人见威胁他也不成事，又想一个办法，向刘长禄要一部分碎木片和鑤花。经刘长禄请示上级批准后，就让那商人取走一部分碎木片和鑤花。可是在装车时商人又把一部分木料偷走，结果被刘长禄发现。刘长禄严正地批评了商人。由于刘长禄在思想上行动上注意和那个品质恶劣的商人不断地斗争，终于使修建任务按照合同如期圆满完成。
    （九）刘长禄不但经常保持着共产党员的艰苦朴素、廉洁奉公的优良传统，而且也创造了巨大的节约成绩。一九五一年一月起始，他负责修建华东公安干部学校校舍的工作，为了节省费用，常常忘了吃饭，东奔西跑，从不嫌累，到处调查市价。
