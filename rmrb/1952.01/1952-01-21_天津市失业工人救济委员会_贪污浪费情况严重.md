    Tianjin Unemployment Relief Committee
    Serious Corruption and Waste

    Editor: The bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of the Tianjin Unemployment Relief Committee has caused great waste. Xing Weiqin, a staff member of the Relief Committee's Production Section, embezzled over 260 million yuan of relief funds, of which 150 million yuan was embezzled when he recovered a loan from the fur cooperative in May of last year. Xing Weiqin's personal life was corrupt, and he even seduced a colleague's wife, but the leading cadres never gave him any punishment. After Xing recovered the funds, he should have handed them over to the accounting department and reported to the person in charge of the production section. However, Xing took advantage of the Relief Committee's lack of an inspection system to employ duplicity in order to achieve the purpose of embezzlement. When the accounting department asked him for the money, he said he had not received it; when the production section asked him, he claimed that he had already handed the money over to the accounting department. The leading cadres did not discover his deceptive behavior for a long time, which shows the seriousness of the bureaucracy. Now, Xing Weiqin has been arrested.

    The "Self-Help Gunny Sack Factory" run by the Relief Committee has closed down due to a loss of more than 100 million yuan. The reason for the closure is the irresponsibility of the leading cadres and the lack of attention to management. For example, the factory's accounts did not record the number of raw materials, but there were many raw materials piled up in the yard. During the rainy season, the factory covered the grass with gunny sacks, and the rainwater seeped through the sacks, soaking the grass, and these raw materials rotted into waste grass.

    I think the problems existing in the Tianjin Unemployment Relief Committee are quite serious. In order to avoid greater losses in the future, I suggest that relevant departments conduct an in-depth inspection of the bureaucratic work style of the Relief Committee's leading cadres.

### 天津市失业工人救济委员会  贪污浪费情况严重

    天津市失业工人救济委员会
    贪污浪费情况严重
    编辑同志：天津市失业工人救济委员会的领导干部的官僚主义作风，造成很大浪费。救济委员会生产处人员邢维钦侵吞了救济金二亿六千多万元，其中一亿五千万元是他在去年五月向皮毛合作社收回贷款时贪污的。邢维钦平时生活腐化，曾经勾引过同事的老婆，但领导干部始终没有给他任何处分。邢收回款项后，按理应缴给会计处，并向生产处负责人交代。但邢钻了救济委员会没有检查制度的空子，就要两面手法，以达到贪污的目的。当会计处向他要款项时，他说尚未收到；生产处问他时，他推说已把款缴给会计处了。对他这种欺骗行为，领导干部竟长期没有发觉，可见官僚主义的严重。现在，邢维钦已被逮捕。
    救济委员会所办的“自救草袋厂”已因亏累一亿多元而倒闭了。倒闭的原因是领导干部不负责任和不重视经营。比如这个厂的账上没有记原料数目，在院里却堆积着很多原料。在雨季时，厂里把草袋盖在草上面，雨水渗透草袋，把草淋湿，这些原料就霉烂得变成废草。
    我认为天津市失业工人救济委员会存在的问题是相当严重的。为了避免以后更大的损失，我建议有关部门对救济委员会领导干部的官僚主义作风作深入检查。    白水天
