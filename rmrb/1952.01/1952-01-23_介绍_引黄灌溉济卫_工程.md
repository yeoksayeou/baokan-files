Introducing the "Divert Yellow River Water to Irrigate and Aid the Wei River" Project
    Jun Qian
    The first phase of the "Divert Yellow River Water to Irrigate and Aid the Wei River" project in the Plain Province within the lower reaches of the Yellow River has been successfully completed, and water can be released to irrigate 230,000 mu of farmland in April this year. This is the first time in history that Yellow River water has been used for irrigation in the lower reaches of the Yellow River.

    The Yellow River is one of the most difficult rivers to manage in the world. Before 1946, there were 1,591 recorded breaches of the Yellow River, and seven major changes in its course; during the 269 years of the Qing Dynasty alone, there were 600 breaches; from 1912 to 1933, during the 22 years of rule by the Northern Warlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries, there were 94 breaches; especially in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, the number of breaches was the highest. However, since the people took control of the Yellow River in 1946, there has not been a single major flood in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, which used to flood every year. In 1949, the People's Government launched the "Divert Yellow River Water to Irrigate and Aid the Wei River" project in Plain Province, beginning the great initiative of transforming the lower reaches of the Yellow River into a beneficial river.

    The main purposes of this project are twofold:
    First is irrigation: To divert water from the Yellow River to irrigate farmland in the four counties of Xinxiang, Huojia, Yanjin, and Ji County on the north bank of the Yellow River. This area is a wheat and cotton producing region, with Xinxiang being a major cotton producing area, but agricultural production has often been limited due to water shortage. After the completion of this project, the amount of Yellow River water introduced through the canals can irrigate 360,000 to 450,000 mu of farmland, which will greatly increase the crop yield in this area.

    Second is to replenish the Wei River: The Wei River, from Xinxiang to Linqing where it joins the Grand Canal, is an important waterway in Plain Province connecting to Tianjin, with a total length of 1,750 li. During the high water season in summer and autumn, wooden boats of tens to over a hundred tons can navigate. However, during the dry season in spring and early summer, it is difficult for even tens of tons of boats to navigate. By diverting 17 to 20 cubic meters per second of Yellow River water into the Wei River, the Wei River can maintain a medium water level (about 2 meters deep); every year except during the freezing period, navigation can be maintained. After further dredging and clearing the Wei River, 200-ton steamships will also be able to navigate. This will greatly promote the exchange of goods and the development of production.

    In addition, there are three incidental benefits: First, in some areas of Xinxiang and Huojia, the groundwater level is too high and the soil is alkalized due to poor drainage, affecting agricultural production. The Yellow River diversion project can not only provide irrigation, but also play a role in drainage and alkali washing, which can gradually eliminate the alkalinity of these lands. Second, there are many sandy lands in this area, and the silty Yellow River water can be used for siltation and irrigation to improve the soil. Third, there are four locations along the main canal where Yellow River water is introduced that can be used for power generation, helping to develop local small-scale industries.

    This project involves building a canal head gate three li west of the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the north bank of the Yellow River to divert water. The main canal starts from the canal head gate, turns from the west side of the Beijing-Hankou Railway to the east side, and flows into the Wei River near Xinxiang City via Wuzhi and Huojia, with a total length of 105 li. The planned water diversion is 40 cubic meters per second. The main canal branches into four canals: The West Canal branches from the main canal south of the Zhongyi Station on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, extending north to the Xinxiang-Jiaozuo Railway branch line, with a length of 32 li and a planned water flow of 7 cubic meters per second, irrigating farmland in the Huojia area. The East Canal 1 branches from the main canal at the Zhongyi Station, extending north to the abandoned Yellow River embankment, with a length of 14 li and a planned water flow of 6 cubic meters per second, irrigating farmland in the Xinxiang area, known as the East Canal 1 irrigation area. The East Canal 2 branches from the main canal northeast of the Xiaoji Station on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, extending northeast to the west of Ji County, with a length of 29 li and a planned water flow of 7 cubic meters per second, irrigating farmland in the Xinxiang and Ji County areas, known as the East Canal 2 irrigation area. The East Canal 3 is currently still being surveyed. These canals can irrigate a total of 360,000 to 450,000 mu of farmland.

    The total project cost is equivalent to 87.64 million jin of millet. After the completion of the entire project, based on 360,000 mu of irrigated land, the annual increase in agricultural products can be converted to at least 30.53 million jin of millet; the annual increase in benefits from hydroelectric power generation, alkali washing, and soil improvement is also at least 9.45 million jin of millet. The increased benefits from irrigation alone will offset the cost of the entire project in three years.

    This project began in 1949. In December of that year, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission established the "Divert Yellow River Water to Irrigate and Aid the Wei River" Engineering Office. From January to the end of September 1950, the topographical survey of the construction site was completed. From March to the end of August 1951, the flood control dike for the canal head diversion gate, the foundation earthwork for the canal head diversion gate, and the pile driving engineering for the canal head diversion gate were completed, and a portion of the main canal earthwork was also completed. According to the original project plan, the entire project would not be completed until 1953. In July 1951, the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, in order to coordinate with the grain and cotton production increase campaign in 1952, instructed the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to advance the project to release water for irrigation in April 1952. The Yellow River Diversion Irrigation and Wei River Assistance Engineering Office revised the construction plan accordingly and divided the entire project into two phases: The first phase aimed to ensure water release for irrigation in April 1952, completing 69 structures including the necessary main canal and canal head gate, as well as the necessary canals for the West Irrigation Area and the East Irrigation Area 1. Secondly, in order to solve the problem of sediment carried in the diverted water, the earthwork of the sedimentation basin was completed at Zhangcaiyuan, Wuzhi County, on the east side of the upper reaches of the main canal. The second phase of the project will also be fully completed in 1952. After the revised construction plan, the construction scope was expanded starting from September 1951. From October to November, lower-level organizations for the construction of the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation and Wei River Assistance Project were established one after another. The first phase of the project entered a stage of full-scale intense construction, with more than 50,000 civilian laborers participating in the project at its peak.

    Inspired by patriotic enthusiasm, the cadres, technicians, workers, and civilian laborers participating in the project launched a labor emulation drive, which rapidly promoted the project. For example, after the establishment of the Wangjing Construction Site Management Committee of the Zhongyi Construction Office, the efficiency of mixing cement slurry increased from three pans to four pans per day; the task of the Wangguanying Construction Office was to build 20 buildings, and 35 were completed by December 1951. At the same time, many new innovations emerged. (For example, technician Wang Tonggang modified and reduced the throttle of the generator, saving 5 gallons of oil per night, equivalent to 250,000 yuan.) Therefore, the 69 buildings of the first phase of the project were completed by the end of November 1951. In response to Chairman Mao's call to increase production and practice thrift, and to strive to complete the project ahead of schedule, all employees then completed 49 buildings. At the same time, 107 water conveyance canals with a total length of more than 1,000 li were completed, totaling more than 5 million cubic meters of earthwork.

    After the completion of the first phase of the project, the plan to release water to irrigate 230,000 mu of farmland this year in April has been guaranteed. At present, surveying work is being carried out in the West Irrigation Area and the East Irrigation Area 1 in order to mobilize farmers to level the land and prepare for irrigation, and to continue to complete the 540 water gates, small control gates, and bridge structures across the water in these two irrigation areas. Then, surveying, planning, design, and material transportation for the East Irrigation Area 2 and East Irrigation Area 3 projects will be carried out to prepare for large-scale construction in March this year. It is estimated that the entire project may be completed in June this year, one and a half years ahead of the original plan.

    After the completion of the entire project, the agricultural products in this area will become more abundant due to suitable irrigation. Soon, irrigation ditches will crisscross the villages and fields in this area, and a beautiful landscape of lush crops will appear, becoming a happy paradise for the people. In addition to the dead of winter, large and small ships will also travel between Xinxiang and Tianjin all year round, becoming an important artery for exchanging goods and developing the economy. The lower reaches of the Yellow River, which have been a scourge for thousands of years, can be transformed into a beneficial river in a very short period of time under the system of the people's democratic dictatorship.

    介绍“引黄灌溉济卫”工程
    君谦
    黄河下游平原省境内的“引黄灌溉济卫”工程第一期工程已经胜利完工，今年四月就可以放水灌溉二十三万亩田地。有史以来，在黄河下游利用黄水灌田，这是一个开端。
    黄河是世界上最难治理的一条大河。一九四六年以前，历史上有记载的黄河决口就有一千五百九十一次，大改道七次；仅满清统治的二百六十九年间，就决口六百次；自一九一二年到一九三三年北洋军阀和国民党反动派统治的二十二年间，决口九十四次；特别是黄河下游，决口次数最多。但是，自从一九四六年开始，人民控制黄河以后，历年决堤泛滥的黄河下游，就再没有发生过一次严重的水灾。一九四九年人民政府又在平原省境内举办“引黄灌溉济卫”工程，开始了变黄河下游为利河的伟大创举。
    这个工程的主要目的有二：
    第一是灌溉：引黄河的水灌溉黄河北岸新乡、获嘉、延津、汲县四县的农田。这一带是产麦子和棉花的区域，新乡一带盛产棉花，但常常因为缺水，限制了农业生产的发展。这个工程完成后，从渠道引入的黄河水量，可灌溉农田三十六万亩到四十五万亩，将使这个地区的农作物产量大为提高。
    第二是接济卫河：卫河从新乡到临清和南运河汇流，是平原省通天津的重要航道，全长一千七百五十里。每年夏秋水量大的时候，可以航行数十吨到一百多吨的木船。但到春季和夏初的枯水期，数十吨的船也难以航行。用引入的黄水流量中的十七到二十秒立方公尺灌入卫河，可使卫河经常保持中水位（水深约二公尺）；每年除冰冻期外，便可经常航行。再把卫河加以整理疏浚后，二百吨的汽船也能航行。这样对于交流物资，发展生产有很大作用。
    另外，还有三个附带的作用：第一、新乡、获嘉一带有些地方，由于排水不利，地下水位过高，土质碱化，影响农业生产。引黄工程不但可以灌溉，而且还能发挥排水洗碱的作用，可使这些土地的碱质慢慢消灭。第二、这一带还有许多沙地，可利用多淤的黄水，发挥灌淤作用，以改良土壤。第三、引入黄水的干渠上，有四个地方可以发电，帮助发展地方性的小型工业。
    这个工程，是在黄河北岸京汉铁路黄河铁桥以西三里的地方，建筑渠首闸，用以引水。总干渠从渠首闸起，由京汉铁路西侧转入东侧，经武陟、获嘉到新乡市附近流入卫河，共长一百零五里。计划引水量为四十秒立方公尺。总干渠分出四条干渠：西干渠是从京汉铁路忠义车站南的总干渠分出，往北到新乡焦作铁路支线，长三十二里，计划输水量七秒立方公尺，灌溉获嘉一带的农田。东一干渠，从忠义车站的总干渠分出，往北到黄河废堤止，长十四里，计划输水量六秒立方公尺，灌溉新乡一带的农田，为东一灌区。东二干渠，从京汉铁路小冀车站东北总干渠分出，往东北到汲县城西止，长二十九里，计划输水量七秒立方公尺，灌溉新乡和汲县一带的农田，为东二灌区。东三干渠目前还在测量。各干渠共可灌溉农田三十六万亩到四十五万亩。
    全部工程费共需小米八千七百六十四万斤。工程全部完成后，灌溉方面，以三十六万亩计，每年增加的农产品，最低可折合三千零五十三万斤小米；其他水力发电、洗碱、改良土壤等项的增益，每年最低也有九百四十五万斤小米。只就灌溉一项，三年的增益就可抵足全部工程的费用。
    这个工程是从一九四九年开始的。那年十二月，黄河水利委员会成立了“引黄灌溉济卫”工程处。一九五零年一月到九月底，完成了工地的地形测量。一九五一年三月到八月底，完成了渠首引水闸的防洪堤、渠首引水闸的闸基土工和渠首引水闸的打桩工程，并完成了总干渠土工的一部分。按照原来的工程计划，全部工程要在一九五三年才能全部完成。一九五一年七月，中央人民政府水利部为了配合一九五二年粮棉增产运动，指示黄河水利委员会要使这个工程提前到一九五二年四月放水灌溉。引黄灌溉济卫工程处根据这个指示，重新修订了施工计划，把全部工程分做两期进行：第一期以保证在一九五二年四月放水灌溉为目标，完成引水必需的总干渠、渠首闸等建筑物六十九座，以及西灌区和东一灌区必需的渠道。其次，为了解决引水时挟带进来的泥沙问题，在总干渠上游东侧武陟县张菜园完成沉淀池土工。第二期工程，也将在一九五二年内全部完成。改订施工计划后，从一九五一年九月起开始扩大了施工范围，十月到十一月，先后建立了引黄灌溉济卫工程施工的下层组织，第一期工程就进入全面紧张的施工阶段，参加工程的民工最多时有五万多人。
    参加工程的干部、技术人员、工人、民工在爱国主义热情的鼓舞下，展开了劳动竞赛，使工程迅速推进。如忠义施工所王井工地管理委员会成立后，洋灰拌浆效率，由每天三盘提高到四盘；王官营施工所的任务是建筑二十座建筑物，到一九五一年十二月就完成了三十五座。同时，还出现了许多新创造。（如技师王同岗改修缩小发电机油门，每夜可节省油五加仑，折合人民币二十五万元。）因此，在一九五一年十一月底完成了第一期工程的六十九座建筑物。全体职工为响应毛主席增产节约号召，争取提前完成工程，又紧接着完成建筑物四十九座。同时完成了输水渠道一百零七条，共长一千多里，共计土方五百多万立方公尺。
    第一期工程完成后，今年四月就可以放水，首先灌溉二十三万亩农田的计划，已经有了保证。目前正进行西灌区、东一灌区的测量工作，以便发动农民平整土地，做好灌溉的准备，并继续完成这两个灌区的五百四十座过水的水门、小节制闸、便桥等建筑物。然后进行东二灌区和东三灌区工程的测量，规划设计、运料等工作，做好今年三月大规模施工的准备。估计全部工程可能在今年六月完成，较原计划提前一年半。
    在全部工程完成后，因为有了适宜的灌溉，这一带地区的农产品将会更加丰盛起来。这一带的村庄和田野间，很快就要出现灌溉沟渠纵横，田禾繁茂旺盛的美丽景象，成为人民的幸福乐园。新乡和天津间，除了隆冬天气以外，也将常年交驰着大小船只，成为交流物资，发展经济的重要动脉之一。千年为害的黄河下游，在人民民主专政的制度下，很短时间就可以变成利河。
