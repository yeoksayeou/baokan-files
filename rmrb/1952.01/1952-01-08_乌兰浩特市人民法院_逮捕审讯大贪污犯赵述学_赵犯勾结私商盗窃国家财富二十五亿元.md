    Ulanhot People's Court
    Arrests and Interrogates Major Embezzler Zhao Shuxue
    Zhao Colludes with Private Merchants to Steal 2.5 Billion Yuan of State Assets
    On December 7, 1951, the Ulanhot People's Court arrested major embezzler Zhao Shuxue. Zhao Shuxue was the director of the Construction Committee of various organs stationed in Ulanhot City under the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government. During his tenure, he engaged in embezzlement and corruption, stealing state assets, causing a loss of 2.5 billion yuan to the state.
    Zhao has participated in revolutionary work for six or seven years. In 1950, the Ulanhot City Construction Committee was established, and Zhao Shuxue was appointed as its director. During his tenure on the Construction Committee, Zhao Shuxue colluded with illegal private merchants to steal state construction materials. In 1950, the Ulanhot City Construction Committee processed 3386.966 cubic meters of logs. In 1951, it processed 3074 cubic meters of logs. Zhao Shuxue entrusted the processing of these logs to the private Furenhe Processing Factory in Qiqihar City. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government's state-owned First Lumber Mill in Qiqihar City could have undertaken this business. Qinggeletu, the deputy director of the Inner Mongolia Forestry Bureau, had sent cadres to tell Zhao Shuxue to entrust the processing business to the lumber mill. However, Zhao Shuxue, in order to seek personal gain, ignored the Forestry Bureau's request. Zhao Shuxue and the Furenhe Processing Factory colluded with each other. From the beginning of 1950 to October of last year, for nearly two years, they stole a total of 1239.375 cubic meters of wood (accounting for 19% of the total processed logs). Valued at 1.6 million yuan per cubic meter of wood, they stole a total of 1.983 billion yuan. They also engaged in fraud in processing costs, causing a loss of 107.3717 million yuan to the state. Zhao Shuxue also protected the Furenhe Processing Factory in its short delivery of finished products and theft of raw logs. Last year, the Furenhe Processing Factory shipped 62 railcars of finished products. Zhao Shuxue prevented the cadres of the Construction Committee from inspecting these finished products. As a result, out of more than 1940 cubic meters of finished products, nearly 140 cubic meters were missing. Calculated at the then price, the state suffered a loss of 161 million yuan. The red pine logs sent by the Construction Committee to the Furenhe Processing Factory were all 4 to 6 meters long, but most of the finished products returned were short pieces less than 4 meters long (this loss has not yet been calculated).
    In procurement work, Zhao Shuxue also wooed private merchants and excluded state-owned department stores. A large quantity of glass and other materials was needed for construction projects. The Northeast Siping City Department Store sent a special person to contact the Construction Committee for purchase and sale in June of last year. Zhao Shuxue rejected the contact from the Siping City Department Store but colluded with the private merchant Liu Shaonan. Zhao Shuxue paid Liu Shaonan 60 million yuan at one time to purchase glass. Liu Shaonan used 64.7 million yuan to buy 307 boxes of glass from the Siping City Department Store. Liu Shaonan only delivered 243 boxes to the Construction Committee but demanded 77.2 million yuan. Sheet iron tiles were needed for construction projects. The Inner Mongolia Coal Industry Building Materials Company had sheet iron tiles in stock and sent people to negotiate with Zhao Xueshu four times, but Zhao Shuxue rejected them all. Instead, Zhao Shuxue colluded with private merchants in Qiqihar City to buy two batches of sheet iron tiles, embezzling 88.04 million yuan from them.
    Zhao Shuxue undermined state laws and colluded with private merchants to engage in speculative activities. He repeatedly sent blank certificates stamped with the Construction Committee's seal to the private Furenhe Processing Factory. The Tianzeng Shengxing Company in Qiqihar City took a blank certificate from the Furenhe Processing Factory and falsely claimed to purchase sheet iron tiles in Mianduhe. This matter was discovered by the local Public Security Bureau. However, Zhao Shuxue continued to use blank certificates to help private merchants do speculative trading and raise prices.
    Zhao Shuxue even cut corners and reduced materials to damage state buildings. When the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Branch of the People's Bank of China was building houses, Zhao Shuxue actually sent 70 cubic meters of rotten wood left over from the puppet Manchuria era to the site for use. After the bank raised objections, Zhao Shuxue shamelessly said to the manager of the Yuxing Construction Company, which contracted the project, "The quality is not good, just make do with it, don't report it, just muddle through." The workmanship and materials for other units' projects were also mostly crude and shoddy, causing great losses.
    Zhao Shuxue, as a state cadre, violated laws and privately opened a processing factory to engage in speculative activities. He opened a "Longtai Processing Factory" in Ulanhot City in the name of his uncle, Zhao Dezhang. Zhao Shuxue repeatedly used his "factory" to steal state assets. In 1950, the Construction Committee had a surplus of scrap materials that could be used to make doors and windows. Zhao Shuxue sold these scrap materials cheaply to his Longtai Processing Factory, estimated to have stolen at least 7.36 million yuan from the state. Zhao Shuxue also sold a batch of logs and old doors and windows to his factory, from which he made exorbitant profits of more than 4.4 million yuan. When Zhao Shuxue's Longtai Processing Factory processed logs for the Construction Committee, it reduced the yield rate, stealing 47.69 cubic meters of finished products and 8 cubic meters of firewood, some of which were resold to the Construction Committee at high prices, stealing a total of 96.9 million yuan from the state.
    Zhao Shuxue also tried to win over the cadres of the Construction Committee. Individual people with weak wills were dragged into the water by him to be his "errand boys."
    Zhao Shuxue embezzled, engaged in fraud, and stole state assets, which, according to verified figures, are worth about 2.5 billion yuan. This huge embezzlement case was not discovered by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government until November of last year. When the Financial and Economic Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region sent an inspection team to investigate the case, Zhao Shuxue still stubbornly refused to confess, attempting to deceive the government. The Inner Mongolia Financial and Economic Committee filed a complaint with the Ulanhot People's Court on December 7 of last year. The People's Court has arrested Zhao Shuxue for interrogation.

    乌兰浩特市人民法院
    逮捕审讯大贪污犯赵述学
    赵犯勾结私商盗窃国家财富二十五亿元
    乌兰浩特市人民法院一九五一年十二月七日逮捕了大贪污犯赵述学。赵述学是内蒙古自治区人民政府驻乌兰浩特市各机关修建委员会主任，在任职期间，贪污腐化，盗窃国家资财，使国家财产损失二十五亿元。
    赵犯参加革命工作已六、七年之久。一九五○年乌兰浩特市成立修建委员会，赵述学被任为主任。赵述学在修建委员会任职期间，勾结不法私商，盗窃国家建筑材料。乌兰浩特市修建委员会一九五○年加工原木三千三百八十六点九六六立方公尺。一九五一年加工原木三千零七十四立方公尺。这些木材的加工，赵述学都委托给齐齐哈尔市的私营福仁合加工厂承包。齐齐哈尔市原有内蒙古自治区人民政府公营的第一制材厂，可以接受这一业务。内蒙古林业总局副局长庆格勒图曾派干部告诉赵述学，要他把加工业务委托给制材厂担任。赵述学为了贪图私利，竟对林业总局的要求置之不理。赵述学和福仁合加工厂狼狈为奸，从一九五○年初到去年十月将近两年期间，共盗窃木材一千二百三十九点三七五立方公尺（占加工原木总数的百分之十九）。以每立方公尺木材折价一百六十万元计，共盗窃十九亿八千三百万元。他们还从加工费用上舞弊，使国家损失一亿零七千三百七十一万七千元。赵述学还庇护福仁合加工厂短交成材和盗换原木。去年福仁合加工厂运来六十二车皮的成材，赵述学阻止修建委员会的干部对这些成材进行检尺。结果在一千九百四十多立方公尺的成材中，短少将近一百四十立方公尺，按当时价格计算，国家共损失一亿六千一百多万元。修建委员会发往福仁合加工厂的红松原木都是四公尺到六公尺的长材，运回来的成材却多半变成了四公尺以下的短材（这笔损失现在还没计算出来）。
    在采购工作中，赵述学同样拉拢私商排斥公营百货公司。在修建工程中需用大批玻璃等材料。东北四平市百货公司去年六月曾派专人和修建委员会接洽购销。赵述学拒绝了四平市百货公司的接洽，却勾结了私商刘绍南。赵述学一次付给刘绍南六千万元，要刘采购玻璃。刘绍南用六千四百七十多万元从四平市百货公司买玻璃三百零七箱。刘绍南只交给建筑委员会二百四十三箱，竟要价七千七百二十多万元。建筑工程需要洋铁瓦。内蒙古煤业建筑器材公司存有洋铁瓦，并四次派人和赵学述商洽，都被赵述学拒绝。赵述学却勾结齐齐哈尔市的私商买进两批洋铁瓦，从中贪污八千八百零四万元。
    赵述学破坏国家法令和私商狼狈为奸进行投机活动。他曾不断地把盖有修建委员会图章的空白证明书送给私营福仁合加工厂。齐齐哈尔市天增盛行就从福仁合加工厂拿去了一张空白证明书。冒名到免渡河去收购洋铁瓦。这件事情曾被当地公安局发觉。但是，赵述学仍然继续用空白证明书帮助私商做投机买卖，抬高物价。
    赵述学甚至偷工减料破坏国家建筑。中国人民银行内蒙古自治区分行修建房屋时，赵述学竟然把伪满时代留下来的腐朽木料七十立方公尺送往现场使用。银行提出意见后，赵述学竟无耻地向承包这一工程的裕兴建筑公司经理说：“质量不好，将就用着，别反映，糊弄糊弄就算了。”其他单位的工程，工料也大多粗糙不堪，造成很大的损失。
    赵述学身为国家干部，竟然违犯法令，私自开设加工厂，进行投机活动。用他叔父赵德章的名义在乌兰浩特市开办了一个“隆泰加工厂”。赵述学屡次用他的“工厂”进行窃取国家资财的勾当。一九五○年修建委员会剩余了一批能做门窗的残材。赵述学把这批残材贱卖给他的隆泰加工厂，据估计至少盗取国家七百三十六万元。赵述学还把一批原木和旧门窗卖给他的工厂，从中获取暴利四百四十多万元。赵述学的隆泰加工厂为修建委员会加工原木时降低出材率，窃取成材四十七点六九立方公尺，盗取薪材八立方公尺，其中有的又以高价转卖给修建委员会，共窃取国家九千六百九十万元。
    赵述学还多方拉拢修建委员会的干部。个别意志薄弱的人就被他拖下水去，做他的“跑腿”。
    赵述学贪污舞弊盗窃国家资财，据已查实者，共值二十五亿元左右。这一巨大贪污案件直到去年十
    一月才为内蒙古自治区人民政府发觉。内蒙古自治区人民政府财政经济委员会派出检查组调查这个案件时，赵述学仍死不坦白，企图欺骗政府。内蒙古财政经济委员会就在去年十二月七日向乌兰浩特市人民法院提出控告。人民法院已把赵述学逮捕进行审讯。  （蒙新）
