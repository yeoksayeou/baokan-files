Dear commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, revolutionary disabled and wounded soldiers, families of revolutionary martyrs, and families of revolutionary soldiers:

The New Year of 1952 has arrived. As we celebrate this festive season, we sincerely thank and remember you. I would like to extend my highest respects and heartfelt greetings to you on behalf of the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country.

Over the past year, our country has achieved new accomplishments in military, political, economic, cultural, and other aspects: Tibet has been peacefully liberated, and the entire Chinese mainland has achieved a unity of the people unprecedented in history. Our people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated through the victorious progress of the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Our national defense forces are being strengthened, and the organization, equipment, technology, and training of the army are all developing towards modernization. The majority of our agricultural and industrial production has almost recovered to the highest levels in our history. The exchange of goods between urban and rural areas has greatly developed compared to last year, and the prices across the country are basically stable. Our cultural and educational undertakings have made significant progress; the friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups are becoming increasingly close. These achievements should be attributed to the hard-working and meritorious comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who are still shouldering the important task of national defense, and to the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who are fighting alongside the Korean People's Army against the invading forces of U.S. imperialism and others. Without your heroic struggle against domestic and foreign reactionaries, the Chinese people's revolution would not have been victorious. Even with victory, without your defense of the motherland, the victory could not be consolidated, and various construction projects would be impossible to carry out. Therefore, you are the defenders of the people, the most beloved people.

In the revolutionary struggle, some comrades have shed their last drop of blood for the people. Their selfless spirit of sacrifice is the highest standard of revolutionary morality. Glory to the great revolutionary martyrs!

Revolutionary disabled soldiers and comrades undergoing treatment in hospitals due to injuries sustained in the revolutionary struggle: you are supremely glorious. I would like to extend my deepest respect to you and hope that those of you who are currently undergoing treatment will recover soon and return to your work posts.

Families of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers: you love the motherland, support the revolutionary war, and mobilize your children and husbands to join the people's army. You are the most beloved mothers, fathers, and wives; you are good examples among the people.

You have contributed to the people, and the people respect, love, care for, and support you. During the Spring Festival this year, various places widely launched campaigns to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers. Especially after the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea issued three major appeals on June 1st, the people of the whole country more enthusiastically launched the campaign to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers. Around the "August 1st" Army Day, various places across the country conducted major inspections of preferential treatment work. In July and August, the Central People's Government specially organized visiting delegations to various old revolutionary base areas. Through these efforts, the preferential treatment work in various places has been inspected and improved, and various places have universally conducted education on patriotism and preferential treatment policies for the people, enhancing the people's political awareness, making supporting the army and giving preferential treatment gradually become a social trend. Whether in cities or villages, people regard supporting the army and giving preferential treatment as an important task in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and have incorporated preferential treatment work into patriotic pledges, and have implemented it into practical action. In addition to various organizations, groups, schools, and state-owned enterprises having begun to seriously give the families of martyrs and soldiers all the priority rights they should enjoy, many private industries have also voluntarily formulated measures such as reducing prices or providing free preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers. Some people even voluntarily provide long-term tuition fees for the children of martyrs. The work of substitute farming in rural areas has significantly improved, and the land yields of the families of martyrs and soldiers are close to the land yields of local farmers, and the land yields of individual families of martyrs and soldiers have even exceeded the land yields of local farmers. The method of substitute farming has been greatly improved. The vast majority of villages in the old areas have implemented a fixed substitute farming system, and the tendency of randomly assigning labor in the new areas has gradually been corrected. Urban people's governments have done their best to organize the families of martyrs and soldiers for production and employment, so that the livelihood difficulties of most families of martyrs and soldiers have been resolved. All aspects of the resettlement and education of revolutionary disabled soldiers, and the care for the lives of impoverished families of martyrs and soldiers have also been more successful than in the past. All of this is something that can bring you comfort.

However, our work still has shortcomings. Some cadres and masses have insufficient understanding of the fact that preferential treatment work is a long-term political task, and they neglect propaganda and education work. Therefore, preferential treatment work has not universally created a regular mass movement; some places have not thoroughly implemented the preferential treatment policies, and many agencies and units have not seriously given the families of martyrs and soldiers all the priority rights they should enjoy. The organization of the families of martyrs and soldiers for production and substitute farming work must be further strengthened; the particularly difficult families of martyrs and soldiers need better care. These are all things that we must strive for in the future.

Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, made a report on the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The report stated: "Continue to strengthen the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers. Party and government organs at all levels and people's organizations must regularly grasp the leadership of this work and constantly check it to ensure the implementation of the preferential treatment plan. We propose that around the Spring Festival next year, all parts of the country conduct another general inspection of preferential treatment work, and formulate specific plans for preferential treatment work for next year, with the jurisdiction of grassroots political power as the unit." We are determined to specifically realize this proposal.

Dear comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: may you strive to defend national defense and strive for the realization of peace! We will take good care of your families.

Dear revolutionary disabled soldiers: we will do our best to solve any difficulties you may have. We hope that you will cherish your honor and strive for greater glory in various positions such as work, production, and study!

Dear wounded and sick comrades: you have been wounded and become ill due to overwork for the people. We extend our heartfelt greetings to you from afar.

Dear families of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers: We wish you good health!

    中央内务部谢觉哉部长新年向解放军和志愿军、革命残废军人和伤病军人、革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的广播词
    （一九五一年十二月三十一日在中央人民广播电台播讲）
    亲爱的中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的全体指挥员和战斗员、革命残废军人和伤病员、革命烈士家属、革命军人家属同志们：
    一九五二年的新年来到了。当我们欢度这个佳节的时候，我们很诚挚地感激和怀念你们。我谨代表中央人民政府和全国人民向你们致以崇高的敬礼和亲切的慰问。
    一年来，我们国家取得了军事、政治、经济、文化等各方面的新成就：西藏已和平解放，整个中国大陆出现了历史上从来没有过的人民的统一。我们的人民民主专政，在抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命三大运动的胜利进展中，业已获得了进一步的巩固。我们的国防力量在加强，军队的编制、装备、技术、训练等各方面都正向现代化发展。我们的农业和工业生产，大部分已接近于恢复到我国历史上的最高水平，城乡物资交流工作比去年有了很大的发展，全国物价基本稳定。我们的文化教育事业有了显著的进步；各兄弟民族间的友谊合作，越来越加亲密。这些成就的取得，应归功于劳苦功高而现在仍担负国防重任的中国人民解放军同志们；应归功于与朝鲜人民军并肩向美帝国主义等侵略军作战的中国人民志愿军同志们。因为没有你们对国内外反动派进行英勇的斗争，中国人民革命便不会胜利；胜利了，没有你们保卫祖国，胜利便巩固不住，各种建设工作也便不可能进行。因此，你们是人民的保卫者，是人民中最可爱的人。
    在革命斗争中，有些同志已为人民流尽了最后一滴血，他们这种忘我的牺牲精神，是革命道德的最高标准。伟大的革命烈士们永垂不朽！
    在革命斗争中因负伤而残废的军人和正在医院疗养中的伤病员同志们：你们是无上光荣的。我谨向你们致以深切的敬意。并盼现在疗养中的同志们早日恢复健康，重回工作岗位。
    革命烈士家属、革命军人家属同志们：你们热爱祖国，支援革命战争，动员自己的儿女、丈夫到人民军队里去。你们是最可爱的母亲、父亲、妻子，你们是人民中的好榜样。
    你们有功于人民，人民尊敬你们，热爱你们，关怀你们，支援你们。今年春节期间，各地曾普遍地开展拥军优属运动。特别在中国人民抗美援朝总会于六月一日发出三大号召后，全国人民更热烈地展开了拥军优属运动。“八一”建军节前后，全国各地进行了优抚工作的大检查。七、八月间，中央人民政府特组织访问团分赴各革命老根据地进行访问。通过这些工作，各地的优抚工作得到检查和改进，各地普遍地对人民进行了爱国主义和优抚政策的教育，提高了人民的政治觉悟，使拥军优属逐渐形成社会风气。无论城市和乡村，人民都把拥军优属看做抗美援朝运动中的一项重要工作，纷纷把优抚工作订入爱国公约，并已贯彻到实际行动中去。除各机关、团体、学校、公营企业已开始认真给予烈属、军属应享受的各项优先权利外，也有不少的私营行业自动订出了减价或免费优待烈属、军属等办法。甚至有些人自愿长期地供给烈士子弟的上学费用。农村的代耕工作有显著提高，烈属、军属的土地产量已接近当地农民的土地产量，个别烈属、军属的土地产量还超过了当地农民的土地产量。代耕方法有很大改进，老区绝大多数村庄实行了固定代耕制，新区乱派工的偏向也逐渐纠正。城市人民政府都尽可能地组织烈属、军属生产和就业，使大部烈属、军属的生活困难获得解决。各地对革命残废军人的安置和教养、对贫苦烈属、军属生活的照顾等各方面，也都比过去做得有成绩。凡此一切，都是可以告慰于你们的。
    但我们的工作还有缺点，有些干部和群众对优抚工作是一个长期的政治任务认识不足，忽视宣传教育工作，因而优抚工作还没有普遍地造成经常的群众性的运动；有些地方还没有把优抚政策深入地贯彻下去，许多机关、单位没有认真地给烈属、军属应享受的各项优先权。组织烈属、军属生产和代耕工作还必须进一步加强；部分特殊困难的烈属、军属还需要更好的照顾，这些都是我们今后必须努力的。
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上中国人民抗美援朝总会副主席彭真作了关于抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告。报告中说：“继续加强优待烈士家属、军人家属的工作。各级党政机关和人民团体对这一工作，必须经常抓紧领导，并不断加以检查，切实保证优抚计划的执行。我们提议在明年春节前后全国各地对优抚工作再进行一次普遍的检查，并以基层政权的辖区为单位，订出明年优抚工作的具体计划。”这一提议我们决心要具体实现。
    亲爱的中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军全体同志们：希你们努力保卫国防和争取和平的实现吧！你们的家属我们会妥当照顾。
    亲爱的革命残废军人同志们：你们有什么困难我们尽力解决。我们希望你们在工作、生产、学习等各种岗位上珍爱荣誉，争取更大的光荣！
    亲爱的伤病员同志们：你们为人民负伤、积劳成疾，谨向你们遥致亲切的慰问。
    亲爱的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属同志们：祝你们身体健康！
