Beijing Municipal Thrift Examination Committee

Started Comprehensive Inspection of Business and Industry Yesterday

Unlawful Merchants Who Refuse to Confess Should Take Liu Yuanjing and Others as a Warning

[本报讯] (Our Newspaper) After the Beijing Municipal Thrift Examination Committee's deadline for inspection, which was approved by the Municipal Government for a three-day extension, expired, it began a comprehensive inspection on the 12th of the bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state assets in the business and industrial sectors. On the 12th alone, many unlawful industrialists and businessmen's criminal facts were discovered and confirmed. The largest of these cases is the case of Liu Yuanjing, manager of Beijing Jingye Construction Factory, and other unscrupulous merchants colluding to undermine national defense construction and steal more than 8 billion yuan of state property.

In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Beijing, the Municipal Thrift Examination Committee has repeatedly given those in the industrial and commercial sectors who have engaged in bribery and tax evasion the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, hoping that they will quickly and thoroughly confess their crimes of bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state assets. Since December 25, 1951, the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and its offices in various districts and industry associations have universally held various meetings, large and small, to explain the policies of the People's Government to people in the industrial and commercial sectors, calling on everyone to bravely and sincerely confess and report all acts of corruption and bribery. Many responsible persons of trade associations took the lead in confessing their problems. Many industrialists and businessmen with higher political awareness confessed and made reports. However, there are still many industrialists and businessmen who refuse to confess, or confess very incompletely, trying to get away with it; a few people even adopted an attitude of resistance and sabotage toward the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement. Some unlawful industrialists and businessmen colluded with corrupt elements and resolutely refused to confess. For example, Zhao Zhiqin, a salesman of the Da Zhonghua Soap Factory, an unlawful merchant, used various means in the past to win over and seduce staff members of government agencies. After the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement began, he also prevented Guo Tiansheng, a purchasing agent of the Fifth District Joint Cooperative, from confessing, and threatened Guo Tiansheng, saying, "Confessing will do you no good!" "I have twenty or thirty cadres like you in my hands!" Some capitalists used various despicable means to threaten and lure shop assistants, attempting to suppress reports and conceal criminal facts.

On January 7, the Beijing Municipal Thrift Examination Committee convened the heads of the thrift examination sub-committees of the industrial and commercial sectors to report on the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement. The Municipal Government accepted the request from the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce to the industrial and commercial sectors for a three-day extension to give some people a final opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, and approved another three-day extension for inspection.

On January 8 and 10, the Federation of Industry and Commerce held two mobilization meetings for the chairman, vice-chairman, secretary-general and all members of the various industry associations. Fu Huating, chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, asked all members to immediately take the lead in thoroughly explaining their problems and drive the whole industry to thoroughly confess and report all acts of corruption and bribery. The district offices of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the various industry associations also convened mobilization meetings and group meetings again, or invited key households to talk separately. Many responsible persons of industry associations and industrial and commercial households changed their past dishonest attitude, confessed or supplemented their bribery, tax evasion and other facts, and boldly reported the corrupt and bribery behaviors of state employees. As of the last day of the January 11 deadline, more than 10,000 pieces of materials had been confessed and reported by the industrial and commercial sectors. Some people boldly exposed and reported major corruption and bribery cases. For example, a certain business firm confessed that it had bribed cadres three times for a total of more than 20 million yuan. Someone reported that a certain business firm had failed to affix 1 billion yuan in stamp tax, stole state property worth approximately 40 million yuan by cutting corners, and bribed cadres more than 16 million yuan. All this shows that the publicity and mobilization work of the Municipal People's Government and the various levels of the Federation of Industry and Commerce has achieved considerable results, and the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in the industrial and commercial sectors has been launched more comprehensively and deeply. However, there are still many industrialists and businessmen who are stubbornly clinging to their mistakes, waiting and seeing, and refusing to confess, or confessing very incompletely; at the same time, the phenomenon of resisting and sabotaging the movement still exists. In order to thoroughly eliminate unlawful acts of bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state assets in the industrial and commercial sectors, and to severely crack down on those unscrupulous merchants who refuse to confess, the Municipal Thrift Examination Committee has transferred a large number of staff members and started a comprehensive inspection of the industrial and commercial sectors after the expiration of the three-day deadline. During the inspection process, many unscrupulous merchants were still extremely cunning and even displayed hooliganistic attitudes, but their crimes were eventually discovered by the inspection team, so they had to confess their guilt. Some extremely sinful unscrupulous merchants, such as Liu Yuanjing, manager of the Jingye Construction Factory, resolutely refused to admit their crimes, but because the facts were all there, they have been arrested and brought to justice by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. This shows that those unlawful merchants who use various despicable and恶劣 means to evade taxes and defraud state property cannot escape the eyes of the People's Government and the broad masses of the people. All industrialists and businessmen who have engaged in bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property should take Liu Yuanjing and others as a warning and quickly and thoroughly confess all criminal acts before the inspection team inspects them; otherwise, they will also be sanctioned by the state law.

    北京市节约检查委员会
    昨开始在工商界中进行全面检查
    不法商人拒不坦白者应以刘元敬等犯为前辙之鉴
    【本报讯】北京市节约检查委员会在市府批准延长三天进行检查的期限届满以后，已在十二日开始全面检查工商界中的行贿、偷税和盗窃国家资财的犯罪行为。在十二日一天的检查中已经发现和证实了许多不法工商业者的犯罪事实。其中最大的是北京敬业营造厂经理刘元敬等奸商互相勾结，破坏国防建设，盗窃国家八十多亿元财产案。
    在北京市的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，市节约检查委员会曾经一再给予工商界中有行贿、偷税行为的分子以改过自新的机会，希望他们迅速彻底地坦白行贿、偷税和盗窃国家资财的犯罪事实。自一九五一年十二月二十五日开始，市工商联和它在各区的办事处及各行业公会都普遍地召开了各种大小会议，向工商界人士说明人民政府的政策，号召大家勇敢地、诚恳地坦白检举一切贪污行贿事实。许多同业公会的负责人，都带头交代了自己的问题。许多政治觉悟较高的工商业者纷纷坦白并进行检举。但是仍然有许多工商业者拒不坦白，或者坦白得很不彻底，企图混过去；少数人甚至对反贪污反行贿运动采取了对抗、破坏的态度。有的不法工商业者和贪污分子互相串通，坚决不肯坦白。如不法商人、大中华肥皂厂推销员赵治清，过去曾用种种手段拉拢、勾引政府机关工作人员，这次反贪污反行贿运动开始后，他又阻止合作社第五区联社的采购员郭天盛坦白，并威胁郭天盛说：“坦白了对你没有好处！”“像你这样的干部在我手里的就有二三十个！”有的资本家用种种卑鄙的手段威胁和利诱店员，企图压制检举，隐瞒犯罪事实。
    一月七日北京市节约检查委员会，召集工商界节约检查分会负责人汇报反贪污反行贿运动情况，市府接受了市工商联给工商界提出的延期三天以最后争取某些人改过自新机会的请求，又批准再延期三天进行检查。
    一月八日和十日，工商联曾两次召开了各行业公会正副主任委员、秘书长和全体委员的动员大会，工商联主任委员傅华亭要求各委员立即带头将问题彻底交代清楚，并带动全业彻底坦白和检举一切贪污行贿行为。工商联各区办事处和各行业公会，也都再次召开了动员大会和小组会，或者分别约请重点户谈话。许多行业公会的负责人和工商户都转变了过去的不老实态度，坦白或补充了自己的行贿、偷税等事实，并大胆地检举了国家工作人员的贪污受贿行为。截至十一日限期的最后一天，工商界坦白检举的材料已达一万多件。有的人大胆地揭发检举了大的贪污受贿案件。如某商行坦白出自己三次共向干部行贿两千多万元。有人检举出某家商行漏贴十亿元的印花税，用偷工减料的方法盗窃国家财产约值四千多万元，并向干部行贿一千六百多万元。这一切说明市人民政府和工商联各级组织的宣传动员工作已收到相当大的成绩，工商界的反贪污反行贿运动已全面地较深入地开展起来了。但是，现在仍然有许多工商业者执迷不悟，观望等待，拒不坦白，或者坦白得很不彻底；同时抗拒和破坏运动的现象也还存在。为了彻底肃清工商界中的行贿、偷税和盗窃国家资财的不法行为，给与那些拒不坦白的奸商以严重打击，因此市节约检查委员会抽调了大批工作人员，在三天限期届满后已在工商界中开始了全面的检查工作。在检查过程中，许多奸商仍然狡猾异常，甚至耍出流氓态度，但终被检查组查出罪行，因而不得不认罪。有些罪大恶极的奸商，如敬业营造厂经理刘元敬等虽然坚决不承认，但因事实俱在，已由市公安局将他们逮捕法办。这就说明那些利用种种卑鄙恶劣的手段来偷漏税款和诈骗国家财产的不法商人，要想逃过人民政府和广大人民的眼睛是完全不可能的。凡是有行贿、偷税和盗窃国家财产的工商业者，应该以刘元敬等为前辙之鉴，在检查组未检查到自己以前，迅速彻底地坦白一切犯罪行为；否则就会同样受到国家法律的制裁。
