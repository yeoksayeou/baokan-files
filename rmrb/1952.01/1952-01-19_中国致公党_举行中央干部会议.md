Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 15th: The China Zhi Gong Party held a central cadre meeting in Guangzhou from January 2nd to 9th. Twenty-five people attended the meeting, including members of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party and responsible cadres from various local organizations.

　　The meeting heard a report from Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, on the resolutions of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and a political report from Secretary-General Zheng Tianbao. The meeting used criticism and self-criticism to focus on reviewing the China Zhi Gong Party's participation in the Three Great Movements of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, Land Reform, and Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries over the past year, as well as the ideological style of cadres. The meeting decided that the main tasks for this year are: under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to mobilize all party members to continue to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, vigorously launch the movement to increase production and practice thrift, and strive for self-education and self-transformation; in the current period, special emphasis should be placed on participating in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The meeting also resolved to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the China Zhi Gong Party's overseas organizations, strengthen ties with overseas Chinese, and promote the patriotic movement of overseas Chinese. In view of the fact that the organization of the China Zhi Gong Party has not yet been consolidated, the meeting decided that the future organizational line should be to purify the internal ranks, consolidate the organization, and at the same time establish a Discipline Inspection Committee to strictly enforce party discipline.

　　On the opening day of the meeting, democratic parties and democrats in Guangzhou warmly received the representatives attending the Central Cadre Meeting of the China Zhi Gong Party at a joint celebration of the New Year. Rao Zhangfeng, Acting Minister of the United Front Work Department of the South China Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and heads of local organizations of various democratic parties in Guangzhou delivered speeches at the meeting to congratulate the China Zhi Gong Party.

    【新华社广州十五日电】中国致公党于一月二日至九日在广州举行中央干部会议。出席会议的有中国致公党中央委员会委员及各地方组织的负责干部共二十五人。
    会议听取了中国致公党中央委员会主席陈其尤关于中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议的决议的传达报告、秘书长郑天保的政治报告。会议用批评和自我批评的方法，有重点地检查了中国致公党一年来参加抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动的情况和干部的思想作风。会议决定今年的主要任务是：在中国共产党领导下，动员全体党员继续加强抗美援朝运动，大力展开增产节约运动，努力进行自我教育和自我改造；在目前时期，应特别着重参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争。会议并决议加强中国致公党海外组织的政治领导和思想领导，加强对海外华侨的联系，推进华侨的爱国主义运动。会议鉴于中国致公党的组织尚未巩固，因此决定今后的组织路线是纯洁内部，巩固组织，同时成立纪律检查委员会，严格执行党的纪律。
