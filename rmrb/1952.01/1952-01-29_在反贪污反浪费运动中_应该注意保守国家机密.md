    In the Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste Campaign,
    Attention Should Be Paid to Maintaining State Secrets
    To the Editor: Recently, when I passed through Wangfujing Street in Beijing, I heard many comrades talking about the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in their organizations as they walked. This shows that comrades are concerned about this campaign. However, in their conversations, some comrades often mentioned names and said, "So-and-so must have a relationship with so-and-so," "So-and-so often interacts with a certain business, possibly taking bribes," "The construction of a certain base is a serious waste," and so on. In just one hour, I encountered four or five such instances. I think it is not good to talk casually like this, regardless of the occasion. This can easily expose state secrets unintentionally. At the same time, the people on the street are very diverse, and perhaps the corrupt elements concerned are right beside us. This could cause losses to our work. I think each organization should tell its staff to pay attention to this issue.

### 在反贪污反浪费运动中  应该注意保守国家机密

    在反贪污反浪费运动中
    应该注意保守国家机密
    编辑同志：日前我经过北京市王府井大街时，听到许多同志，一边走、一边谈他们机关里的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的情况。这可以说明同志们对这次运动的关心。但是，有些同志在谈话中，常常提名道姓地说：“某人和某人一定有关系”“某人和某商号经常来往，可能受贿”“修建某基地，浪费很严重”等等。只在一个小时内，我就碰到四、五起。我以为这样不分场合地随便乱谈是不好的。这样很容易在无意中暴露国家机密。同时，街上行人很复杂，说不定有关的贪污分子就在我们身边。这会给我们的工作招致损失。我觉得各机关应该告诉本机关工作人员注意这个问题。
