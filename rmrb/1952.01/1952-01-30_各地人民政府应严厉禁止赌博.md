    Local People's Governments Should Strictly Prohibit Gambling

    According to my understanding, the gambling trend in some areas is quite serious at present, and local governments urgently need to stop it. A small number of bad elements, having been allocated land, are unwilling to work diligently and still inherit the loafer habits of the past, "eat, drink, gamble...". In Huilong District, Qidong County, Northern Jiangsu, it is common to see four or five people together, bringing chickens, ducks, fish, and meat, buying wine, and going to relatively remote places to gamble, followed by a big feast after a big gamble. Sometimes, small shops along the roads are crowded with people who are also gambling. Generally, the gambling trend will be even more prevalent during the Spring Festival. I believe that local governments should strictly prohibit gambling. This is of great importance to "increasing production and practicing economy."

    各地人民政府应严厉禁止赌博
    据我了解，目前有些地方的赌博风气相当严重，急待当地政府制止。有少数坏分子，分得了土地，不愿勤劳耕作，仍然继承着过去那“吃、喝、赌……”的二流子习气。在苏北启东县汇龙区，常常可以看到四、五个人一起，带着鸡、鸭、鱼、肉，买上酒，到比较边僻的地方去赌博，大赌后就大吃大喝一顿。有时，在一些路头的小店里，挤满了人，也在进行赌博。一般地，春节期间，赌博的风气将会更盛行。我认为各地政府应严厉禁止赌博。这对于“增产节约”是大有关系的。
