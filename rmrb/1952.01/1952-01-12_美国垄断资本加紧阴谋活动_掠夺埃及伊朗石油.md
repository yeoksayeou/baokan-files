Xinhua News Agency, January 11th - American monopoly capital is intensifying its efforts to squeeze out British influence in Egypt and plunder Egypt's rich oil resources. According to a Reuter report from Washington on the 4th, American Texaco oilman Mr. McKinsey has signed an agreement with the Egyptian National Petroleum Company to exploit oil in the Sinai Peninsula and along the Red Sea coast. American capital will own 51% of the shares in this oil field area, thereby gaining control of an annual output of 2.5 million tons of product.

    New York industrialists have expressed great satisfaction with this agreement. They confirmed that McKinsey's negotiations were orchestrated by the US State Department and are part of a movement by the US government to take advantage of Britain's series of failures in the Middle East to advance its own interests. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs, Mr. Berry, recently stated that the situations in Iran and Egypt primarily demonstrate that Britain's economic position in these relevant countries has been greatly shaken.

    It is generally believed that the US government's approval of the agreement signed by McKinsey and the Egyptian Petroleum Company indicates that American capital has further infiltrated areas previously controlled by Britain.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 10th - The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, controlled by the United States, is stepping up its activities in Iran in order to replace the position of the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and plunder Iran's abundant oil resources.

    After the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development officially stated on November 20, 1951, that it was willing to "assist" in resolving the so-called Anglo-Iranian oil dispute, it dispatched two representatives to Iran on December 31st to conduct an investigation. One of the representatives, Mr. Rieber, is the general manager of the New York Barber Oil Company, who has "extensive experience in American and international oil production." After arriving in Iran, they met with Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh on January 2nd and requested to visit the large refinery in Abadan for an on-site investigation.

    The London "Daily Worker" commented on January 4th on the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's conspiracy against Iran, saying that the bank's "mastermind is American, so its policy is also American policy." When the US State Department intervened in the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute, its aim was to seize Iran's oil industry.

    According to a TASS report on the 7th, the British weekly "Tribune" also published an editorial pointing out that the United States' actions regarding the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute were insidious. The weekly also said that Britain and the United States are conducting a "behind-the-scenes war" in the Near East.

    America's conspiracy cannot escape the eyes of the Iranian people, who are bravely fighting for national independence. The Tehran newspaper "Bisu-Ayangdi" commented on the arrival of the two representatives of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Tehran, saying that this is a step towards "laying the foundation for the future rule of the American master." Tens of thousands of people in Tehran recently passed a resolution stating that accepting the enslaving conditions of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is an act of treason.

    美国垄断资本加紧阴谋活动
    掠夺埃及伊朗石油
    【新华社十一日讯】美国垄断资本正在进一步排挤英国在埃及的地位，掠夺埃及的石油富源。据电通社华盛顿四日讯：美国德士古石油公司油商麦克锡已和埃及国家石油公司签订一项协定，以开采西奈半岛及红海沿岸地区的石油。美国资本将拥有这个油田区百分之五十一的股份，从而取得了年产二百五十万吨产品的控制权。
    纽约工业界人士对这一协定很表满意。他们证实：麦克锡的谈判是由美国国务院策动的，并且是美国政府利用英国在中东一连串的失败而谋取其本身利益的运动的一部分。美国国务院负责近东、南亚与非洲事务的助理国务卿柏利最近曾经发表声明说：伊朗和埃及的局势首先证明了英国在这些有关国家中的经济地位已大为动摇。
    一般认为，美国政府批准麦克锡和埃及石油公司所签订的协定，就表明美国资本已更进一步地侵入以前英国所控制的地区。
    【新华社十日讯】美国控制下的国际复兴开发银行正加紧在伊朗进行活动，以便代替前英伊石油公司的地位，掠夺伊朗丰富的石油资源。
    国际复兴开发银行在一九五一年十一月二十日正式声明它愿意“协助”解决所谓英伊石油争端后，已派遣两名代表在十二月三十一日到达伊朗进行调查。其中一名代表莱柏尔是在美国和“国际的石油生产方面有长久的经验”的纽约巴柏尔石油公司的总经理。他们到伊朗后，曾在一月二日和伊朗首相摩萨台举行会议，并要求到阿巴丹去实地调查该地的大炼油厂。
    伦敦“工人日报”在一月四日评论国际复兴开发银行对伊朗的阴谋时说：该银行的“主脑是美国人，所以它的政策也是美国的政策”。当美国国务院干涉英伊石油争端的时候，它的目的是夺取伊朗的石油工业。
    据塔斯社七日消息：英国的“真理”周刊也发表社论，指出美国对英伊石油争端所采取的行为是居心叵测的。该周刊并说，英、美正在近东进行“幕后战争”。
    美国的阴谋是逃不过正为争取民族独立而英勇斗争的伊朗人民的眼睛的。德黑兰“比苏·阿杨第报”对国际复兴开发银行的两个代表抵达德黑兰一事发表评论说：这是“为美国主子将来的统治奠下基础”的一个步骤。德黑兰的数万人民最近曾通过决议说：接受国际复兴开发银行的奴役条件就是卖国行为。
