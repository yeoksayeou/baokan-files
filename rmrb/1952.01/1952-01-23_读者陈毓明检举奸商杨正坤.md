    Reader Chen Yuming Reports on 奸商 Yang Zhengkun
    Comrade Editor: Yang Zhengkun, the boss of Wuxi Wencheng Machine Factory in Southern Jiangsu, uses deceptive means to exploit workers and infringe on state property. In September 1950, Yang Zhengkun brought a group of workers from Wuxi to the Beijing Eastern Suburb Flour Mill to install machinery. At that time, he told the workers: this work has a time limit of three and a half months to complete, if it can be completed ahead of schedule, the wages for three and a half months will still be paid. As a result, the project was completed ten days ahead of schedule. At this time, Yang Zhengkun violated his promise and deducted ten days' wages from all workers (a total of 49 people), amounting to more than 18 million yuan. He also used the method of deducting odd sums from wages to underpay wages by 4 to 5 million yuan. In addition, he even sold some old machine parts as new machine parts to the Eastern Suburb Flour Mill. Among them, a crane was damaged when lifting the flour purifier because the center pin was bad, resulting in a loss of more than 3 million yuan in RMB for this item alone. I suggest that relevant departments punish the 奸商 Yang Zhengkun. Chen Yuming

    读者陈毓明检举奸商杨正坤
    编辑同志：苏南无锡文成机器厂老板杨正坤，用欺骗手段剥削工人，并侵害国家财产。一九五○年九月，杨正坤从无锡带一批工人，到北京东郊面粉厂安装机器。当时，他对工人说：这个工作限期三个半月完成，若能提前完成，三个半月的工资仍然照发。结果，工程提前十天完成了。这时杨正坤竟违背约言，尅扣了全部工人（共四十九人）十天的工资，共达一千八百多万元。他并用扣工资零头的方法，少发工资四、五百万元。另外，他更把若干旧机件当新机件卖给东郊面粉厂。其中有一个起重机，因中心销子不好，在吊清粉机时把它砸坏了，只这一项就损失人民币三百多万元。我建议有关部门，惩办奸商杨正坤。　陈毓明
