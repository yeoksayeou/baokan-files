    A Good Method for Saving Gasoline in a Direct Company of a Certain Unit of the Northwest Military Region
    Editor: In the People's Daily on October 30th of last year, page two, there was an article introducing the method of saving gasoline by driver You Yushu - putting the car in neutral when going downhill. I think this method is very dangerous and not worth promoting. (Editor's note: According to a letter from the Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Transport of the Central People's Government, it is extremely abnormal to shift the gear lever to neutral or depress the clutch to turn off the ignition when a car is going downhill. This not only easily damages brakes, clutches, and other parts, but also easily causes accidents. Therefore, using the method of going downhill in neutral to save fuel should not be promoted.)
    Now, I am writing out the preliminary experience of our unit's direct company in saving gasoline for relevant agencies to refer to. (1) We converted the carburetors of the ten-wheeled GMC trucks into Chevrolet carburetors; later we removed the choke from the Chevrolet carburetor, did not enlarge the air hole, and blocked the quick-car fuel injection hole with toothpaste skin. In this way, we can save eighty-eight gallons of gasoline in a journey of 1,500 kilometers. (2) We adjust the ignition timing according to the coldness or heat of the weather. When the weather is hot, we adjust the ignition to the slow position; when the weather is cold, we adjust the ignition to the fast position. This not only saves gasoline, but also protects the life of the car.
    From January to September of last year, the direct company of our unit saved a total of eight thousand gallons of gasoline, and at the same time achieved vehicle protection and driving safety.

### 西北军区某部直属一连节省汽油的方法好

    西北军区某部直属一连节省汽油的方法好
    编辑同志：去年十月三十日人民日报第二版登了一篇文章，介绍了驾驶员游玉书节省汽油的方法——把汽车的挑挡在下坡时放在空挡上，我认为这个方法有很大危险，是不值得推广的。（编者按：据中央人民政府交通部运输局来信说：汽车下坡时，把变速杆移置空挡或踏下离合器来关闭电门，是极不正常的操作方法。这不只容易损坏制动器、离合器等机件，而且很容易肇事。所以用下坡放空挡的方法来节省燃料是不应提倡的。）
    现在，我把我部直属一连的节约汽油的初步经验写出来，供有关机关参考。（一）我们把十轮吉姆西车的化油器改装成雪佛兰化油器；以后我们又把雪佛兰化油器阻风门去掉，不要加大风眼，再把快车喷油眼用牙膏皮堵小。这样，在一五○○公里的行程内，可以节省八十八加仑的汽油。（二）我们看天气的冷热来调节发火时间。当天气热时，我们把火头调在慢的位置；当天气冷时，把火头调在快的位置。这样不但节约了汽油，而且还保护了汽车的寿命。
    自去年一月至九月，我部直属一连共节省了八千加仑的汽油，同时还做到了保护车辆和行车安全。
