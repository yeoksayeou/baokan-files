    Guo Songrong and Zhao Biao of Changsha Taxation Bureau, Colluding with Private Merchants to Kill Cattle and Sabotage Tax Revenue, Related Criminals Have Been Sent to Court for Punishment

    Guo Songrong and Zhao Biao, cadres of the Changsha Taxation Bureau, colluded with unscrupulous merchants to undermine tax policies and slaughter more than 1,000 head of cattle, embezzling and engaging in corruption. The relevant criminals have been prosecuted.

    Guo Songrong and Zhao Biao are both from Changsha and had both joined feudal "gang" organizations. During the Japanese occupation of Changsha, Guo Songrong served as a "plainclothes peace soldier" for the Japanese invaders. After liberation, in October 1950, Guo and Zhao infiltrated the North Branch of the Changsha Taxation Bureau and were assigned to work as cattle inspectors at the North District slaughterhouse. Before Guo and Zhao entered the slaughterhouse, they became acquainted with cattle merchant Ling Zhongwu (a landlord) while "helping" inspect cattle. Through Ling Zhongwu's connections, Guo and Zhao successively colluded with dozens of cattle merchants, including Min Donghai, Peng Meichen, Yang Ronghua, Shi Boqin, Zhang Desheng, and Huang Zimao. These cattle merchants had forged "slaughter stamps" and privately slaughtered more than 1,500 head of cattle near the liberation of Changsha. After colluding with Guo and Zhao, these cattle merchants relapsed into their old ways, adopting various despicable and cruel methods—breaking the legs of good cattle, strangling the cattle's noses with palm ropes, and nailing iron nails into the cattle's hooves or cutting off the hoof shells, rendering the cattle crippled; and forged a large number of fake people's government seals, privately issuing certificates for disabled cattle—to bring the cattle to the slaughterhouse for inspection. When Guo Songrong and Zhao Biao inspected these cattle, they merely touched the cattle's mouths casually, without even looking, and passed them off as "disabled cattle," allowing them to be slaughtered. Guo and Zhao also repeatedly stole the inspected disabled cattle certificates and gave them to these cattle merchants. In addition, Guo and Zhao colluded with You Changxing, a pork merchant with a background as a ruffian soldier, to evade slaughter taxes. From August 1950 to August 1951, this group of unscrupulous merchants successively slaughtered 1,360 head of cattle and evaded taxes on 270 pigs. From this, Guo Songrong embezzled more than 9.3 million RMB, 17 "silver dollars," and accepted 70 jin of beef as bribes; Zhao Biao embezzled more than 7.4 million RMB, 10 "silver dollars," and accepted 40 jin of beef and 20 jin of pork as bribes, and also accepted gifts and invitations from merchants on many occasions.

    These corrupt and illegal acts not only harmed the state's huge tax revenue, but also seriously undermined the people's government's laws protecting cattle and affected rural production. The Changsha People's Court has already handed over the principal criminals Guo Songrong, Zhao Biao, and the unscrupulous merchants Min Donghai, Ling Zhongwu, You Changxing, etc., to the Changsha People's Court for punishment according to law.

    长沙市税务局郭松荣、赵彪
    勾结私商杀害耕牛破坏税收有关案犯已被送法院惩办
    长沙市税务局干部郭松荣、赵彪，勾结奸商，破坏税收政策，并杀害耕牛一千多头，从中贪污舞弊，有关案犯已被提起公诉。
    郭松荣、赵彪都是长沙市人，都加入过封建“帮会”组织。郭松荣在长沙沦陷时，充当日寇的“和平军便衣”。解放后，一九五○年十月，郭、赵混入长沙市税务局北区分局，被派驻北区屠宰场作验牛工作。郭、赵未入场前，在“帮助”验牛时，就结识了牛商凌仲武（地主）。通过凌仲武的关系，郭、赵又相继勾结了闵东海、彭梅臣、杨荣华、史伯琴、张德生和黄子茂等数十家牛商。这些牛商曾经在长沙接近解放时，伪造“屠印”，私宰一千五百多头耕牛。这些牛商自从和郭、赵二人勾结后，又故态复萌，采用种种卑鄙、残酷的办法——把好牛的腿打跛，用棕绳把牛鼻勒断，在牛蹄上钉铁钉或削去牛蹄壳，使牛变成残废；大批伪造人民政府印信，私开废牛证明——把牛牵到屠宰场来验。郭松荣、赵彪验这些牛时，只随便向牛口里一摸，连看也不看，就作为“废牛”验过去，听凭屠杀。郭、赵并数次偷把验过的废牛证给这批牛商。此外，郭、赵还勾结兵痞出身的猪商游长兴等，偷漏屠宰税。从一九五○年八月起到一九五一年八月止，这批奸商先后杀害耕牛一千三百六十头，偷漏二百七十只猪的税。从这当中，郭松荣贪污人民币九百三十多万元，“光洋”十七元，受贿牛肉七十斤；赵彪贪污人民币七百四十多万元，“光洋”十元，受贿牛肉四十斤、猪肉二十斤，另接受商人送礼、请客等多次。
    这些贪污违法行为，不只损害了国家巨额税收，并且严重地破坏了人民政府保护耕牛的法令，影响了农村生产。长沙市人民法院已经把主犯郭松荣、赵彪和奸商闵东海、凌仲武、游长兴等，提送长沙市人民法院依法惩办。　　　　　王渤
