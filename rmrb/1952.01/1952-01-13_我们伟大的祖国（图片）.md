    Our Great Motherland
    The mechanized farming school run by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has, since last year, opened training classes for tractor drivers and training classes for mechanical personnel based on the actual needs of state-owned farms, laying the foundation for the development of mechanized farms. After visiting the mechanized farming school last year, the agricultural labor models from various regions who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations had a further understanding of the superiority of mechanized agricultural production. This is a scene of them visiting a crane lifting a threshing machine.
