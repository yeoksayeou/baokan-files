Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: Paris. From December 27th to 30th of last year, representatives of the governments of France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, along with the West German puppet government, held another meeting in Paris in an attempt to reach an agreement on the issue of organizing the so-called "European Army." However, the result was yet another failure.

    This meeting was a continuation of the meeting held in Strasbourg in mid-December last year. Given that the "European Army" plan is the centerpiece of the U.S.'s current war preparations in the West, the U.S. exerted great effort in this meeting, attempting to force France, Italy, and other five countries and West Germany to formulate a treaty to organize the "European Army." According to the Associated Press, on the third day of the Paris meeting, the U.S. military governor of Western Europe, the "Supreme Commander" of the North Atlantic Aggressor Forces, Eisenhower, personally stepped in and "told the leaders of the six European countries to eliminate their differences and accelerate the formation of the European Army." He considered this "the most urgent necessary step." The Associated Press said that Eisenhower's attendance and speech were "his last-minute efforts to促使European countries to reach some form of agreement." The Paris newspaper "Combat" reflected the U.S. demands, saying: "The United States hopes that everything can be resolved before the U.S. Congress reconvenes on January 3rd."

    However, despite the U.S.'s anxiety, the Paris meeting ultimately failed to reach an agreement on the two main issues of the supranational structure controlling the "European Army" and the establishment of a "common budget" for the "European Army." At the meeting, the French representatives vigorously advocated that without a "supranational structure, there could be no real European Army, only a union of national armies." However, the representatives of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg openly expressed their unwillingness to surrender national sovereignty. They feared being completely overwhelmed by their more powerful "partners," therefore, insisted on retaining veto power in the various institutions of the "European Army," and at the same time advocated that each country should retain the right to only provide funding for the troops it handed over to the "European Army." According to Reuters, during the discussion, the Belgian representative believed that if the majority of countries in the so-called "supranational structure" "could impose new taxes and budget expenses on Belgium, even against the will of the Belgian Parliament," "such a thing would be intolerable." In this situation, according to the Associated Press, the Paris meeting ended with "still being stuck in a stalemate" on the fundamental issues of drafting the "European Army" treaty. The final communiqué issued by the Paris meeting could only "task military and financial experts to continue working to eliminate various difficulties" and decided to reconvene in late January this year.

    The reason why the U.S. constantly demands that the "European Army" meeting be held continuously is to be able to make a decision on this issue at the North Atlantic Aggression Group's Council meeting originally scheduled to be held in Lisbon on February 2nd this year. However, now that the Strasbourg meeting and the Paris meeting have successively ended without results, according to a statement by a U.S. State Department spokesperson on the 4th, France has formally requested the U.S. to postpone the Lisbon meeting.

    However, no matter when the Lisbon meeting is postponed to, the day when the "European Army" plan is realized is actually getting further and further away. The contradictions that have erupted among the countries of the North Atlantic Group on this issue foreshadow a danger that the entire U.S. war preparation plan in the West is facing collapse. The U.S. "Time" magazine, published on December 17th of last year, said:
    "The entire year's grand plans and brave arguments... are already teetering. Among all these plans, the most dangerous is the European Army."

### 美国拚凑“欧洲军”的计划  在巴黎会议上又失败  艾森豪威尔曾向附庸国加施压力

    美国拚凑“欧洲军”的计划
    在巴黎会议上又失败
    艾森豪威尔曾向附庸国加施压力
    【新华社八日讯】巴黎消息：去年十二月二十七日到三十日，法、意、荷、比、卢五国政府和西德傀儡政府的代表又在巴黎举行会议，企图对组织所谓“欧洲军”的问题取得协议，但是结果却遭到了又一次的失败。
    这次会议是去年十二月中旬在斯特拉斯堡举行的会议的继续。鉴于“欧洲军”计划是美国目前在西方备战计划的中心，美国对这次会议曾化了极大的力气，企图逼迫法、意等五国和西德制订组织“欧洲军”的条约。据合众社透露：在巴黎会议的第三天，美国驻西欧的军事总督、北大西洋侵略军“总司令”艾森豪威尔曾亲自出马，“告诉欧洲六国领袖，要他们消除分歧的意见，加速组成欧洲军”。他认为这是“最急迫的必要步骤”。合众社说，艾森豪威尔的出席发言，“是他为了促使欧洲国家取得某种形式的协议而作的最后一分钟的努力”。巴黎报纸“战斗报”反映美国的要求说：“美国希望在美国国会一月三日复会以前，一切都能获得解决。”
    但是，尽管美国如此着急，巴黎会议最后在控制
    “欧洲军”的超国家机构和成立“欧洲军”的“共同预算”这两个主要问题上，仍然无法取得协议。会上，法国代表曾竭力鼓吹没有“超国家机构，就不能有真正的欧洲军，而只能有一个各国军队的联合”。但是，荷、比、卢三国代表却公开表示不愿交出国家主权。它们担心会被比较强大的“伙伴”完全压倒，因此，坚持在“欧洲军”各机构中应保有否决权，同时主张每个国家应保有只供给它交给“欧洲军”的军队的经费的权利。据路透社透露，在讨论中，比利时代表认为：如果所谓“超国家机构”中的大多数国家“可以把新赋税和预算费用强加在比利时身上，甚至可以违反比利时议会的意愿来这样做”，“这样的事情是不能容忍的”。在这种情形下，据美联社说，巴黎会议结束时，在拟订“欧洲军”条约的根本问题上“仍然陷于僵局”。巴黎会议最后发表的公报中只能“责成军事和财政专家们继续工作，以便消除种种困难”，并决定今年一月下旬再行开会。
    美国之所以不断要求“欧洲军”会议连续开会，是为了要在北大西洋侵略集团原定于今年二月二日在里斯本举行的理事会会议上，能对这个问题有所决定。然而，现在由于斯特拉斯堡会议和巴黎会议相继无结果而散，据美国国务院发言人四日宣布，法国已正式向美国要求里斯本会议延期举行。
    但是，不论里斯本会议延期到什么时候，“欧洲军”计划实现的日子实际上已愈来愈遥远了。北大西洋集团各国在这个问题上爆发出来的矛盾，预示着美国在西方的整个备战计划已面临垮台的危险。去年十二月十七日出版的美国“时代”周刊说：
    “整个一年的宏大计划和勇敢的论据……已经摇摇欲倒了。在所有这些计划中间，最危险的就是欧洲军。”
