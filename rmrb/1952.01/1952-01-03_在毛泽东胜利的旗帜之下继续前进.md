    Continue to Advance Under the Victorious Banner of Mao Zedong
    Chen Qiyou
    After achieving great victory in 1951, we welcome the arrival of 1952 with boundless joy.
    In 1951, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, our motherland achieved brilliant success in military, political, economic, cultural, and educational fields. First, Tibet was peacefully liberated, making the territory of the People's Republic of China, except for Taiwan, unified for the first time in history. The liberated ethnic groups also embarked on the path of close unity for the first time. Secondly, the great victories of the three major movements of resisting America, aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries have provided a stronger guarantee for the foundation of the People's Republic of China. Finally, unprecedented achievements have been made in construction in the fields of finance, economy, culture, and education. The funds used for water conservancy alone are equivalent to 42 times the maximum amount in a single year during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang.
    Among all the above victories, the most worthy of special mention and the most pride-inducing for the people of our country is the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, because this is the greatest and most glorious event for the Chinese people in 1951. Due to the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army on the Korean battlefield with unparalleled bravery and selfless dedication, resisting the aggression of American imperialism and its accomplices, and giving the aggressor bandits a heavy blow, the American imperialists' plan to invade the world was disrupted. Therefore, our movement to resist America and aid Korea not only defended the security of our motherland but also safeguarded world peace.
    All the above victories are inseparable from the leadership of the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of all the people, Chairman Mao Zedong. Without the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people would never have achieved today's success. Through long-term struggles, we all know that before the imperialists are completely crushed, the United States and its accomplice countries will continue to use their conspiracies to be enemies of the people of our country. But we also know that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have gone through countless storms and waves and finally achieved victory. Therefore, we absolutely believe that we can deal with any treacherous and vicious acts of imperialism. We are not afraid of any imperialist conspiracy.
    Currently, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we are carrying out the ideological remolding of intellectuals and the nationwide movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and have already achieved initial victories. For all the victories of 1952, we will devote ourselves wholeheartedly to these two movements to achieve complete success. At the same time, for the happiness of the people of the world, we should do everything in our power to promote the realization of world peace.
    In 1951, all our people passed in victory and happiness. In 1952, we will achieve greater victories and live a happier life.

    在毛泽东胜利的旗帜之下继续前进
    陈其尤
    在获得伟大胜利的一九五一年之后，我们以无限的欢欣之情迎接一九五二年的来临。
    一九五一年，我们的祖国，在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导之下，在军事、政治、财经、文教各方面，都已获得了光辉的成功。首先是西藏得到了和平解放，使中华人民共和国的领土，除了台湾之外，已实现了历史上从来未有过的统一，而已得解放的各民族之间，也第一次真正走上了亲密的团结。其次是抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命三大运动的伟大胜利。使中华人民共和国的基础，有了更强固的保证。最后，是在财政经济和文化教育各方面的建设上有了中国历史上空前的成就。单就用在水利一项的经费，就相当于国民党反动统治时期最多一年的四十二倍。
    在上述这些胜利之中，最值得特别提出而且最足以令我国人民自豪的，是抗美援朝的胜利，因为这是中国人民一九五一年最伟大光荣的大事。由于中国人民志愿军以无比的英勇和忘我的牺牲精神，在朝鲜战场上，与朝鲜人民军比肩作战，反对了美国帝国主义及其帮伙们的侵略，给了侵略匪徒们以沉重的打击，才打乱了美国帝国主义的侵略世界的计划。因此，我国的抗美援朝运动，不单保卫了我们祖国的安全，也保障了世界的和平。
    所有上述的一切胜利，是和伟大的光荣的正确的中国共产党与全体人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的领导分不开的。没有中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，中国人民绝对不会取得今天的成功。由于长期的斗争，我们都知道，在帝国主义者尚未遭到彻底的粉碎以前，美国和它的帮凶国家们是还要继续使出它们的阴谋，和我国人民为敌的。但是我们也知道在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，中国人民曾经度过了无数的惊涛骇浪终于达到了胜利。因此我们绝对相信是能够和任何帝国主义的奸诈和凶恶的行为相周旋的。我们不怕帝国主义的任何阴谋。
    目前我们在毛主席的领导之下，正在进行知识分子的思想改造和全国范围内的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，而且都已经取得了初步的胜利。为了一九五二年的一切胜利，我们将以全心全力来进行这两个运动。使之达到完全的成功。同时，为了全世界人民的幸福，我们更当以一切力量来促进世界和平的实现。
    一九五一年，我全体人民在胜利和幸福中过去了。一九五二年我们将获得更伟大的胜利和过着更幸福的生活。
