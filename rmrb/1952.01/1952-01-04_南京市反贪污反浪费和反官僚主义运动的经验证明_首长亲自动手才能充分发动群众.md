Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 2nd: Leaders taking responsibility and taking the lead themselves is one of the most important keys to carrying out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. This has been fully proven by the experience of Nanjing.
    Leader responsibility includes two aspects. On the one hand, leading cadres should take the lead in examining themselves and setting an example. At the beginning of the movement, Feng Bohua, Director of the Nanjing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau, went deep into the various departments of the Civil Affairs Bureau to investigate corruption and waste. At the mobilization meeting of all staff, he loudly pointed out the seriousness of the problem, and at the same time, he first profoundly reviewed his own bureaucratic style and extravagant waste. His self-criticism deeply moved all the staff, and a mass upsurge of confession and introspection immediately appeared in the whole bureau. In the Business Section alone, seven people voluntarily confessed their acts of corruption. The leadership of the Nanjing Branch of the China Petroleum Company used to have a serious bureaucratic style. For example, when Zang Ronglin, a staff member of the General Affairs Section of the company, stole and sold steel plates, the leaders not only did not severely deal with him after learning about it, but also allowed Zang Ronglin to serve as the acting section chief. After the study of anti-corruption, waste, and bureaucracy began this time, the leading cadres still did not pay attention to the huge losses caused by these bureaucracies and did not conduct a profound review, so the corrupt elements became arrogant. Zang Ronglin even threatened the masses, saying: "Go ahead and report me!" Therefore, the masses had many concerns and dared not fight corruption and waste head-on. Later, this situation was exposed by the newspaper, which aroused the attention of the company's leading cadres. The company manager made a self-criticism, expressing his determination to oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. At the same time, he also profoundly reviewed his extravagant waste and violations of the system. When the employees saw that the leading cadres had expressed their determination, their enthusiasm greatly increased, and they came forward to report the corrupt elements. The worker Zhang Hongxuan specifically ran to the oil depot five miles away to mobilize Gao Weishan, a staff member who had embezzled gasoline and oil drums, and finally made Gao Weishan confess the facts of corruption.
    The other aspect of the leader's responsibility is to support the masses and resolutely fight against phenomena that suppress democracy. For example, Tang Junzhao, the vice principal of the Nanjing Cadre School, had serious extravagant waste. He used 170 million yuan from the school's surplus funds to purchase a dormitory exclusively for the school's leaders. During this study, the general staff of the school raised opinions to him, but he not only did not examine himself, but also suppressed democracy. After the Municipal People's Supervision Committee investigated and clarified the matter, it immediately asked the Municipal People's Government to give Tang Junzhao the punishment of dismissal and ordered him to reflect and examine himself in front of the masses, so the masses were very excited. Another example is Wang Wenqing, the village chief of Yue'an Village in the Eleventh District of the suburbs, who stole the fruits of land reform, ate and drank extravagantly, and often asked seven or eight farmers to do voluntary labor for him, suppressing the opinions of the peasant masses. These illegal acts were even shielded by the township head. After the start of this movement, the peasants wrote letters to the newspaper to accuse him. After the leaders of the district learned about this situation, they resolutely supported the masses. At the mass meeting held in Yue'an Village, the district head, on behalf of the People's Government, announced the dismissal of Wang Wenqing as the village chief. The masses were all overjoyed and said, "This is the first democratic meeting in Yue'an Village."

    南京市反贪污反浪费和反官僚主义运动的经验证明
    首长亲自动手才能充分发动群众
    【新华社南京二日电】首长负责，亲自动手，是开展反对贪污、反对浪费和反对官僚主义运动的重要关键之一。这已为南京市的经验所充分证明。
    首长负责包括两个方面。一方面是领导干部应该带头检查自己，树立榜样。南京市人民政府民政局局长冯伯华在运动开始时，就深入民政局所属各部门调查贪污浪费情况。在全体工作人员动员大会上，他大声疾呼地指出问题的严重性，同时首先深刻地检讨了自己的官僚主义作风和铺张浪费行为。他的检讨使全体工作人员深为感动，全局立刻出现了群众性的坦白反省热潮，仅业务科就有七个人自动坦白了自己的贪污行为。中国石油公司南京分公司领导方面过去曾有严重的官僚主义作风，例如该公司总务科职员臧荣林曾盗卖过钢板，领导方面知道这件事后，不但不严加处理，还让臧荣林担任代理科长职务。这次反对贪污、浪费和官僚主义的学习开始后，领导干部对这些官僚主义所造成的巨大损失还不重视，没有进行深刻检讨，贪污分子就嚣张起来。臧荣林竟威胁群众说：“你们检举去！”因此群众顾虑很多，对贪污浪费现象不敢进行正面斗争。后来这一情况被报纸揭发出来，引起了该公司领导干部的注意，公司经理做了自我检讨，表明了反对贪污、浪费和官僚主义作风的决心。同时还深刻检讨了自己的铺张浪费、破坏制度的错误行为。职工们看到领导干部表明了决心，积极性就大大提高，纷纷起来检举贪污分子。工人张鸿轩特地跑到五里路外的储油所去，对一个曾经贪污汽油和油桶的工作人员高维山进行动员，最后终于使高维山坦白出贪污事实。
    首长负责的另一方面，就是支持群众，对压抑民主的现象进行坚决斗争。如南京市干部学校副校长唐君照有较严重的铺张浪费行为，他曾动用学校经费结余一亿七千万元购买一所专给学校负责人住的宿舍。在这次学习中，该校一般职工向他提意见，他不但不检讨自己，反而压制民主。市人民监察委员会对这一事件调查明白后，立即请市人民政府给唐君照以撤职处分，并责令他在群众面前反省检讨，因此群情昂扬。又如郊区第十一区月庵村村长王文清曾窃取土地改革的果实，大吃大喝，并且经常要七八个农民替他义务劳动，压制农民群众的意见。这些不法行为竟得到乡长的包庇。这次运动开始后，农民们写信给报社控告，该区领导方面知道这一情况后，坚决给群众撑腰。在月庵村举行的群众大会上，区长代表人民政府宣布撤销王文清村长职务。群众都兴高采烈，纷纷说“这是月庵村第一次民主大会。”
