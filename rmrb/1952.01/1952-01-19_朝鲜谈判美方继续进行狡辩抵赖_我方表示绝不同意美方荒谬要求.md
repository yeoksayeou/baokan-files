Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th: At the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 18th, the other side absurdly claimed again that interfering with the right to handle airport equipment within Korea should not be considered interference in our internal affairs as long as it is done with our consent. Our representative sternly pointed out that our handling of any equipment within Korea is entirely a matter of internal affairs, and even the other side has admitted this in the past. Now, in order to justify their argument, they are denying facts they have repeatedly admitted, which proves the absurdity of their demands. No independent sovereign nation can tolerate, let alone agree to, demands to interfere in internal affairs. Our representative pointed out that the demand to interfere in our internal affairs is absolutely intolerable. In order to achieve the goal of ensuring the stability of the armistice, our side has put forward a complete and sufficient plan: the basic principle for ensuring the stability of the armistice is that both sides guarantee that no reinforcing military forces, including combat aircraft, will enter Korea from outside Korea during the armistice. If your side's purpose is truly as you say, to ensure the stability of the armistice to facilitate the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and if you can truly guarantee the implementation of this principle as our side does, then it is impossible to imagine that the air force strength of either side in Korea would increase during the armistice.

At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, the other side again attempted to deny that the so-called principle of "voluntary repatriation" in their proposal is, in essence, a conspiracy to hand over our captured personnel to the Lee Chiang bandit gangs. The other side's representative also flatly denied having publicly announced this conspiracy in the meeting, claiming: "We have never said such a thing, whether publicly, implicitly, or in a way that could be interpreted as such. The United Nations Command does not intend to hand anyone over to any government at any time or in any place." Our representative vehemently denounced this shameless denial, pointing out that just two days ago, the other side's representative had said: "The genuine soldiers of your side whom we are holding, they do not want to return to your side; they are Koreans and want to live under the government of the Republic of Korea. For these people, handing them over to the government of the Republic of Korea is repatriation." The other side also said: "There are two governments in China, which is a recognized fact and does not need to be discussed. Just as Korean soldiers choose to go to that part of Korea, Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war can also be repatriated to the place they choose to go. If they want to go to the Republic of China, they can go." Our representative sternly pointed out that our side will never allow any conspiracy to hand over our personnel to the Lee Chiang bandit gangs.

    朝鲜谈判美方继续进行狡辩抵赖
    我方表示绝不同意美方荒谬要求
    【新华社开城十八日电】十八日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，对方又荒谬地声称，干涉处理朝鲜境内机场设备的权利，只要事经我方同意，就不能算是干涉我方的内政。我方代表严词指出，我方对于朝鲜境内任何设备的处理，完全属于内政问题，即使是对方过去也曾承认这一点，而如今为自圆其说，竟又否认其所一再承认的事实，实足证明对方的要求之荒谬。任何独立主权的国家都决不能容许，更不会同意干涉内政的要求。我方代表指出，干涉我方内政的要求是绝对不能容忍的。为达到保证停战稳定的目的，我方已提出完全充分的方案：保证停战稳定的基本原则就是双方保证在停战期间不自朝鲜境外进入任何增援的军事力量，包括作战飞机。只要你方的目的真如你方所说的在于保证停战的稳定，以利于朝鲜问题的和平解决，而你方又能对这一原则的执行，如我方一样确实予以保证，就根本不能设想停战期间，双方在朝鲜的空军力量会有所增加。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方又企图抵赖对方提案中所谓“自愿遣返”的原则，实质上就是将我方被俘人员送交李蒋匪帮的阴谋。对方代表并矢口否认曾在会议中公开宣布过这种阴谋，声称：“我们从来没有说过这样的话，不论是公开的，暗示的，或可以被解释成那样的。联合国军不打算在任何时间，任何地点把任何人交给任何政府。”我方代表痛斥对方这种无耻的抵赖，指出即在两天以前，对方代表就曾说过：“我方所收容的真正你方军人，他们不愿回到你方，他们是朝鲜人，要在大韩民国政府下生活。对这种人，把他们交给大韩民国政府就是遣返。”对方又说：“中国有两个政府，这是公认的事实，无庸讨论的。正如朝鲜士兵选择到朝鲜那一部分去一样，中国志愿军战俘也可以被遣送到他所选择去的地方，如果他愿意去中华民国，他也可以去。”我方代表严词指出，我方决不容许任何将我方人员送交李蒋匪帮的阴谋。
