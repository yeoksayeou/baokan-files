To the Editor:

Yang Jihua, a representative of military dependents from the 13th Precinct of the Third District of Beijing, reported at a mass meeting that her husband, Chen Shuxia (who is now working in the People's Armed Forces Department of Fucheng County, Pingyuan Province), had used public funds for business in 1950. After the meeting, Yang Jihua also wrote a letter to her husband. The letter read: "Shuxia: How is your anti-corruption movement going? Beijing has now entered its climax. Everyone must carefully examine their behavior since liberation. Have you read the People's Daily? Only honesty is the only way out. Your armed forces department's collective embezzlement of public funds for business is a form of corruption. You must confess to the organization. I have already reported to the People's Government about the money you sent back in July and August 1950. I hope you will confess quickly, and the People's Government can be lenient. You should break through 'sentimentality' and report any corruption or waste phenomena that you know of. In July 1951, I was elected as a representative of military dependents, and I also serve in some street-related work. The District Civil Affairs Section takes good care of our lives, providing preferential treatment grain every quarter. From December, a living subsidy of 120,000 yuan is given every month. I also participated in a political study class. Let's work together hand in hand!" We believe that Yang Jihua's behavior is worthy of learning for all family members of those who have engaged in corruption.

    北京市第三区军属代表杨际华
    检举了她丈夫的贪污行为
    编辑同志：北京市第三区第十三派出所军属代表杨际华，在群众大会上检举了她丈夫陈树嘏（现在平原省复程县人民武装部工作）在一九五零年利用公款作生意的事。会后，军属代表杨际华还给她丈夫写了一封信。信上写道：“树嘏：你们的反贪污运动搞的如何？北京现在已进入最高潮。我们每个人都要好好检查一下自己解放以来的行为。你看人民日报了么？只有坦白才是唯一的出路。你们武装部，集体挪用公款作生意，就是一种贪污的行为。你千万要向组织上坦白。我已经向人民政府交代了一九五零年七、八月间你曾经先后寄钱回来的事。希望你赶快坦白，人民政府可以宽大处理。凡是你所知道的贪污、浪费现象，你都应该破除‘情面’，检举出来。一九五一年七月，我被选为军属代表，我还担任一些有关街道的工作。区民政科对我们的生活照顾得很好，每季发给优待粮。从十二月起，每月给十二万元的生活补助费。我还参加了政治学习班。我俩携手前进吧！”我们觉得，杨际华的行为是值得所有有贪污行为的人的家属学习的。
