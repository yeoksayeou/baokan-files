    Tianjin Jianhua Joint Transport Department
    Should Not Hold Up Land and House Ownership Certificates
    Editor: The Victory Printing Factory of Tangshan was scheduled to finish printing the land and house ownership certificates for the Tianjin Special District in mid-December of last year. All the workers in the factory launched challenges against each other to ensure that the peasant brothers could get their land and house ownership certificates as soon as possible. On December 13th of last year, we completed the task of printing the land and house ownership certificates as scheduled. During the printing, we bound and sent them out at any time. The sending work was handled by the Tangshan Jianhua Joint Transport Station, which sent them to the Tianjin Jianhua Joint Transport Department by express mail, and then forwarded them to various counties. The Joint Transport Department is no more than 400 li from the counties in the Tianjin Special District, and they could be delivered in a short period of time. However, on December 26th, our factory received a phone call from the Tianjin Special District, instructing us to send them quickly, because the counties had only received a few, and some had not received any at all. At that time, our factory asked the Tangshan Jianhua Joint Transport Station, and they said: They had been sent to Tianjin. Our factory went to the Tianjin Joint Transport Department to inquire, and only then did we discover that more than 30 pieces were stored in the Joint Transport Department and had not been sent out. We explained the importance of this task to the Joint Transport Department, and they agreed to find a few large trucks to send them out immediately. On January 12th of this year, our factory received another letter from the Tianjin Special District, which stated: Ninghe County only received 20,000 copies on January 8th (originally sent 52,000 copies); Yongqing County only received one batch, and another batch had not been received; and some places had not received any at all. This situation seriously affected the prestige of the People's Government. We believe that this style of work of the Tianjin Jianhua Joint Transport Department is not good, and they should conduct a self-criticism.　Tangshan Victory Printing Factory

    天津建华联运部
    不应积压土地房屋所有证
    编辑同志：唐山胜利印刷厂给天津专区承印的土地房屋所有证，预定在去年十二月中旬印完。全厂工人为了使农民兄弟早日拿到土地房屋所有证，互相发起挑战。在去年十二月十三日，我们如期完成了承印土地房屋所有证的任务。在印刷期间，我们随时装订，随时发出。发送工作由唐山建华联运栈负责，用快件发到天津建华联运部，然后转发到各县。这个联运部距离天津专区各县最远不过四百里，短期就可送到。但到十二月二十六日，我厂接到天津专区电话，嘱托速发，因为各县只收到少数，也有根本尚未收到的。当时，我厂就问唐山建华联运栈，他们说：已发到天津。我厂又到天津联运部查询，才发现有三十多件存在联运部尚未发出。我们对联运部说明此项任务的重要性，他们才答应即刻找几辆大车发送。今年一月十二日，我厂又收到天津专区来信，信里说：宁河县直到一月八日才收到二万份（原发五万二千份）；永清县只收到一批，还有一批没有收到；也有些地方根本没有收到。这种情况严重地影响了人民政府的威信。我们认为天津建华联运部这种作风是不好的，他们应作检查。　唐山胜利印刷厂
