    Manzhouli Railway Station's Self-Criticism Regarding Waste of Gasoline

    To the Editors: On December 25th of last year, the People's Daily published reader Zhu Kuanfu's criticism of the Manzhouli Railway Station's waste of gasoline. We now make the following self-criticism: This incident was caused by dereliction of duty by Jiang Zhiguang (previously mistakenly reported as Wang Hanwen), an inspector from the Manzhouli Vehicle Depot, and Yang Taichen (previously mistakenly reported as Yang Taibai), a weigher at the station. After Jiang Zhiguang accepted the task of inspecting and repairing tank cars for replacement, he violated labor discipline by leaving his post without authorization to sleep elsewhere. Yang Taichen also failed to proactively check whether the car body was in good condition and whether there were any oil leaks. When someone discovered the tank car was leaking oil, Jiang Zhiguang reloaded the two tons of oil that had leaked into the drain back into the car; Yang Taichen did not stop him at the time. As a result, significant losses were caused to state property. The occurrence of this incident shows that our leading cadres lack regular inspection of their work. We should resolutely correct this bureaucratic style in the future. We have already given Jiang Zhiguang a two-grade salary reduction and Yang Taichen a demerit. We have also formulated measures to prevent such incidents, in order to avoid similar accidents in the future.

### 满洲里车站关于浪费汽油的检讨

    满洲里车站关于浪费汽油的检讨
    编辑同志：去年十二月二十五日人民日报刊载了读者朱宽夫对满洲里车站浪费汽油的批评。我们现在检讨如下：这次事件，是因满洲里车辆段检车工蒋志广（前误为王汉文）、车站司磅员杨太臣（前误为杨太百）失职造成的。当蒋志广接受负责槽车的换装检修任务后，竟违反劳动纪律，擅离岗位，到其他地方睡觉。杨太臣也没有主动检查车体状态是否良好，以及有无漏油之处。有人发现槽车漏油的情况时，蒋志广就把漏入地沟的两吨油，重新装进车内；当时杨太臣也没有加以阻止。因此，给国家财产造成了很大的损失。这次事件的发生，说明了我们领导干部对工作缺乏经常性的检查。我们今后应该切实改正这种官僚主义作风。我们已给予蒋志广降薪两级、杨太臣记过的处分，并已订出防止此种事件的办法，以避免以后再发生类似事故。
