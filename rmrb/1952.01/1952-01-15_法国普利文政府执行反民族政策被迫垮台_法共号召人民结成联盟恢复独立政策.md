Xinhua News Agency, January 12th: Paris News: The French Pleven government, pieced together during a 32-day government crisis in August of last year, collapsed on January 7th. This is a result of the French ruling clique implementing American war policies, plunging the country into an irretrievable economic crisis, and facing strong opposition from the people.

The Pleven government fell when the National Assembly debated the 1952 budget, as its motion of confidence was rejected by the assembly with 341 votes against 243. In France, financial problems have been a fatal threat to successive governments, as the ruling clique endlessly spends huge sums of money on the hopeless colonial war in Vietnam and the expansion movement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. While the French ruling clique obediently implements American war policies, it is unable to suppress the people's resistance to these policies. Therefore, great internal divisions have arisen. When the French National Assembly began to discuss the 1952 budget in late December of last year, the French bourgeois newspapers unanimously believed that the parliament would "launch a huge political struggle over the budget issue." The Paris "Combat" pessimistically predicted: "The Pleven government and the majority faction will encounter difficulties in the National Assembly... The outcome of the difficult budget struggle is uncertain, and it is likely to be a fatal blow to the current cabinet."

The "difficulty" in this "budget struggle" was how to raise huge military expenditures. On December 29th of last year, the Pleven government barely forced the National Assembly to pass 380 billion francs for the 1952 Vietnam war expenditure and 130 billion francs for the first two months of the 1952 expansion expenditure. However, this money was nowhere to be found. France's fiscal deficit last year reached more than 800 billion francs, and this year it is estimated that it may reach as high as 1.5 trillion francs. At present, French taxes have long exceeded the so-called "safe line" of taxation. The French ruling clique pins its hopes on American "alms," but the American "alms" are slow in coming. In this case, Pleven racked his brains and proposed a "financial bill" that drained the pond to catch the fish. It not only required a further increase in huge taxes, but also required "reforms" in the state-owned railways, closing about one-third of the railway lines and laying off a large number of workers; it also wanted to "reform" the social insurance system in order to deprive the French working people of their only welfare; and it also disregarded constitutional provisions and required the parliament to authorize the government to implement these "reforms" directly by issuing administrative orders. Even the National Assembly Finance Committee, manipulated by various right-wing parties, did not dare to agree to this bill because of fear of the people's anger. In this situation, Pleven first used the method of demanding a vote of confidence, which he had repeatedly used in the past, to force the National Assembly to agree to discuss his "financial bill," and as a result, he barely "won" by a narrow majority of seven votes. Then he demanded that the National Assembly hold eight confidence votes on his "financial bill" item by item, in an attempt to force the National Assembly to accept his entire plan. But the French people defeated Pleven's conspiracy. As soon as Pleven's vicious "financial bill" was put forward, powerful protests broke out everywhere in France. The political situation in France made bourgeois observers worried that Pleven government's approach was tantamount to implementing "political suicide". Sure enough, when the National Assembly held a vote of confidence on the first item of the "financial bill" - the "railway reform" plan, the Pleven government was defeated.

Now, just five months after France experienced its longest government crisis in history, it has once again fallen into a state of having no government. As the French economic crisis has become even more serious, even Pleven's Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, Laniel, admitted: "This crisis is more difficult to solve than the last one." After Pleven resigned, French President Auriol successively invited the Socialist Party's Pineau, the Secretary-General of de Gaulle's "Rally of the French People" Soustelle, the leader of the "French Gravedigger" - Independent Republican Peasant Union Renaut, the chairman of the People's Republican Party Bidault, and the leader of the Radical Socialist Party parliamentary group Tailbot to form a government, but all five of them refused to accept the order given the difficult situation. This situation clearly illustrates how fragile the position of the French ruling clique is. Even if they can barely put together a government in the end, the Secretary of the French Communist Party, Duclos, pointed out on the 9th that no matter what form the future government takes, or what forces it relies on for help, if it continues to implement the original anti-people policies, it will never truly solve the current government crisis.

Xinhua News Agency, January 12th: TASS, Paris, 9th Telegram: "L'Humanité" published a statement by the French Communist Party on the collapse of the Pleven government on the 8th. The statement said: The Pleven government's policy is an anti-national policy aimed at intensifying preparations for war and further deteriorating the lives of the French people. This anti-national policy is being implemented at the instigation of foreign countries. The American billionaires are increasingly arbitrarily giving orders on French territory. "Their military occupation of France is increasingly strengthened, and their control over France is gradually leading to economic bankruptcy."

The French Communist Party pointed out: The Pleven government fell because the people opposed its policies. "The fall of the Pleven government proves the success of the united action of the working people."

The French Communist Party pointed out: It is necessary to smash the attempts of the American imperialists and the politicians who accept their subsidies. They want to play tricks that are beneficial to their anti-French national conspiracies in order to solve the government crisis. "They intend to organize a government that dares to support the Pleven plan (Note: refers to the 'European Army Plan') or worse plans and force the French people to accept this plan. The government they dream of has members of the 'Rally of the French People' (De Gaulle Party) as ministers, so as to rely on fascist measures to defeat the people's resistance and pave the way for De Gaulle's rise to dictatorship. They may also want to absorb the leaders of the Socialist Party into the government in order to deceive the people and separate some of the masses from the struggle against social regression, reaction and war policies."

The French Communist Party emphasized: "Relying on the unity of the French working people and the alliance of all patriotic people, the French Communist Party opposes this plan and advocates a policy of progress, freedom, independence and peace. The French Communist Party calls on the French people to form an alliance and take action to fight for the restoration of France's independent policies, for a policy of peace, improving people's welfare and promoting the national economy. The French Communist Party calls on the French working people - Communists, Socialists and Catholic People's Republicans - to unite and work towards this goal. The French Communist Party calls on all the French people, regardless of political views, religious beliefs and social status, to unite, so that the policy that is consistent with their common hope will be victorious, and to establish a peaceful government that only obeys the command of the French people."

    法国普利文政府执行反民族政策被迫垮台
    法共号召人民结成联盟恢复独立政策
    【新华社十二日讯】巴黎消息：经过了三十二天的政府危机才在去年八月间拼凑起来的法国普利文政府，已在一月七日垮台。这是法国统治集团由于执行美国战争政策而使国家陷入无法自拔的经济危机，并使自己受到人民强烈反对的结果。
    普利文政府是在国民议会讨论一九五二年预算问题时，因为它所提出的信任案被议会以三百四十一票对二百四十三票否决而辞职的。在法国，由于统治集团无止境地把巨额金钱耗费在绝望的越南殖民战争和北大西洋集团的扩军运动上，财政问题一直是历届政府致命的威胁。法国统治集团一方面要顺从地执行美国的战争政策，一方面却无法压服人民对这种政策的反抗。因此，内部就发生了极大的分歧。当法国国民议会在去年十二月下旬要开始讨论一九五二年的预算问题时，法国资产阶级报纸就一致认为议会“在预算问题上要展开一场巨大的政治斗争”。巴黎“战斗报”曾悲观地预言：“普利文政府和多数派要在国民议会上碰到难关。……困难的预算斗争的结果是毫无把握的，它很可能成为目前内阁致命的打击。”
    这场“预算斗争”中的“难关”就是如何筹措庞大的军费问题。去年十二月二十九日，普利文政府好容易逼迫国民议会通过了一九五二年度越南战费三千八百亿法郎，和一九五二年度仅仅是一、二两个月的扩军费用一千三百亿法郎，但是，这笔钱却无处可出。法国去年的财政赤字已达八千亿法郎以上，今年估计可能高达一万五千亿法郎。目前，法国的赋税早就超过了通常所谓抽税“安全线”，法国统治集团把希望寄托在美国的“布施”上，而美国的“布施”却迟迟不来。在这种情况下，普利文挖空心思，提出了一个竭泽而渔的所谓“财政法案”。它不仅要求再度增加巨额赋税，而且还要在国营铁路中进行“改革”，封闭约三分之一的铁路线，并解雇大批工人；要把社会保险制度也予以“改革”，以便剥夺法国劳动人民仅有的一点福利；并且还不顾宪法规定，要求议会授权政府直接用颁布行政命令的方式来实施这些“改革”。对于这个法案，甚至各右翼党派操纵下的国民议会财政委员会都因为害怕人民的愤怒而不敢表示同意。在这种情形下，普利文首先就拿出他过去一再使用的要求投信任票的办法，来逼迫国民议会同意讨论他的“财政法案”，结果勉强以七票的微弱多数“得胜”。然后他就又要求国民议会对他的“财政法案”逐条举行八次信任投票，企图以此逼迫国民议会接受他的全部计划。但是法国人民击败了普利文的阴谋。普利文这个穷凶极恶的“财政法案”刚一提出，法国到处就都爆发了有力的抗议，法国国内的政治形势使得资产阶级的观察家都担心普利文政府这种做法无异实行“政治自杀”。果然，在国民议会对“财政法案”的第一项——“铁路改革”案举行信任投票时，普利文政府就遭到了失败。
    现在，在法国发生了历史上最长的政府危机之后不过五个月，法国就又一次陷入了没有政府的状态。由于法国经济危机已经更加严重，甚至普利文的邮电部长拉尼埃都承认：“这一次危机要比上一次更难解决。”在普利文辞职后，法国总统阿里奥尔
    一连请了社会党的比诺、戴高乐的“法兰西人民联盟”总书记苏斯戴尔、“法兰西掘墓人”——独立共和农民联盟领袖雷诺、人民共和党主席皮杜尔和激进社会党议会党团领袖台尔博组织政府，但是，这五个人都鉴于情势困难而拒绝应命。这种情形清楚地说明了法国统治集团的地位如何脆弱。即使他们最后还能勉强拼凑成一个政府，但是法国共产党书记杜克洛已在九日指出：将来的政府不论具有那一种形式，依靠那一种力量的帮助，如果它要继续执行原先的反人民政策，就绝不能真正解决目前的政府危机。
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社巴黎九日电：“人道报”八日刊载了法国共产党关于普利文政府垮台一事的声明。声明说：普利文政府的政策，是以加紧准备战争并使法国人民生活进一步恶化为目的的反民族政策。这种反民族政策是在外国的唆使下实行的。美国的亿万富豪们越来越专横地在法国领土上发号施令，“他们对法国的军事占领越来越加强，他们对法国的控制使法国逐渐走上经济破产的道路”。
    法国共产党指出：普利文政府是因为人民反对它的政策而垮台的。“普利文政府的垮台，证明了劳动人民一致行动的成功。”
    法国共产党指出：必须粉碎美帝国主义者和接受他们的津贴的政客们的企图，他们想玩弄有利于他们的反法兰西民族的阴谋，这样来解决政府危机。“他们打算组织一个胆敢支持普利文计划（按：指‘欧洲军计划’）或者更坏的计划并强迫法国人民接受这种计划的政府。他们梦想中的政府有‘法兰西人民联盟’（戴高乐党）的人担任部长，好依靠法西斯性质的措施来击破人民的反抗，并为戴高乐的登台独裁铺平道路。他们也可能要把社会党的领袖们收揽在政府中，以便欺骗人民，使一部分人民群众脱离反对社会退步、反动和战争的政策的斗争。”
    法国共产党着重指出：“法国共产党倚靠法国劳动人民的团结和全体爱国人民的联盟，反对这种计划，并主张实行进步、自由、独立与和平的政策。法国共产党号召法国人民结成联盟并采取行动，为恢复法国独立的政策，为和平、增进人民福利并繁荣国民经济的政策而斗争。法国共产党号召法国劳动人民——共产党人、社会党人和天主教人民共和党人——联合起来，朝着这个目标努力。法国共产党号召法国全体人民，不分政治见解、宗教信仰和社会地位，团结起来，使那个和他们的共同希望一致的政策获得胜利，并成立仅仅听从法国人民指挥的和平政府。”
