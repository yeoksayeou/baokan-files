In the work of preferential treatment in various parts of Shanxi Province in 1951, many model villages and model substitute farming groups emerged, resulting in bountiful harvests on the land of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, in some cases exceeding the harvest volume of ordinary farmers'耕地. For example, in Yaoshanggou Village, Wuxiang County, the 112 mu of autumn land farmed on behalf of others yielded an average of 1.75 shi per mu, exceeding the average yield of the masses'耕地 by 0.05 shi, and increasing the yield by 0.37 shi compared to 1950. In Dongbailin Village, Fifth District, Huguan County, the 271.3 mu of land farmed on behalf of others yielded an average of 1.6556 shi per mu, exceeding the average yield of the general public (1.5 shi) by nearly 0.16 shi. The substitute farming group led by Zhang Hongxi in Baitagang Village, Eighth District, Guo County, contracted to farm the 7 mu of land belonging to Zhang Chunxi, a military family member. Due to intensive cultivation, the 1951 yield exceeded the usual yield by 35%. This village was originally a severely afflicted village, and the harvest of the general public was only 60% of the usual yield. In other places, such as Dalinkou Village in the Fourth District of Zuoquan, and Yongwan Village in the Fourth District of Gaoping, the land of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel also yielded bountiful harvests. The harvests of the land farmed on behalf of others by the Yuan Hejin substitute farming group in Yuanjia Village, Changzhi, and the Guo Xiaoniu substitute farming group in Lucheng, all exceeded the yields of the general public.

The good work of substitute farming in these places has guaranteed the livelihood of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, and has directly strengthened the power to resist America and aid Korea. Families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel in Yaoshanggou Village, Wuxiang, are already living prosperous lives, and one-third of them have more than 10 shi of surplus grain. After the autumn harvest in Dongbailin Village, Huguan, in 1951, families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel were very happy. Twenty-five families donated 5.3 million yuan to purchase airplanes and cannons, and thirteen families wrote letters to their relatives in the army, reporting on the substitute farming situation and encouraging them to fight the enemy at the front with peace of mind.

The main reasons these places did a good job in substitute farming are, first of all, the strengthening of patriotic education for the peasant masses, which raised their enthusiasm for loving the motherland and the people's army, and made them realize the importance of substitute farming work. Since the launch of patriotic education to resist America and aid Korea in Yaoshanggou Village, Wuxiang County, all 200+ households in the village have subscribed to 37 newspapers, established 27 reading groups and 18 literacy schools, and 36 propagandists regularly conduct propaganda and education among the masses. Everyone in the village knows: "The volunteers are protecting us so we can live in peace, and we must guarantee to grow good crops for the families of the volunteers." "Without the People's Liberation Army, we wouldn't have what we have today." Everyone attaches great importance to preferential treatment work, and incorporates guaranteeing that the yield of land farmed on behalf of others reaches the production level of general advanced households into the patriotic pact, and in June, formulated a detailed plan for half a year of preferential treatment and substitute farming work, challenging all substitute farming groups and substitute farmers in the province. Farmers in various places responded enthusiastically, and generally incorporated doing a good job in substitute farming into the patriotic pact, launching an unprecedented competition campaign for preferential treatment and substitute farming.

Secondly, the implementation of a contract-based substitute farming system, where specific individuals or groups are responsible for the land farmed on behalf of others, ensures that they can "prioritize military families over themselves" during cultivation, cultivating intensively, applying additional fertilizer, and fixing the substitute farming arrangements. This allows the substitute farmers to make unified plans for substitute farming work and their own production in advance, scientifically arranging time and organizing labor, so that both the land farmed on behalf of others and their own land can generally achieve high yields.

Thirdly, in-depth inspections, evaluations, and competitions are conducted, rewarding or commending models, criticizing or punishing backward substitute farmers, and boosting the morale of the masses. For example, Wuxiang County held a county-wide inspection of substitute farming work in the summer of 1951. Each district and village held preferential treatment committee meetings, and absorbed representatives of families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and the masses to form a substitute farming work committee, conducting in-depth inspections in the fields, discovering good and bad examples, and using blackboards, broadcasting, etc. to commend and criticize. Yaoshanggou Village stipulates that substitute farming work is inspected every half month and random checks are carried out at any time. The village's preferential treatment committee also holds monthly meetings with families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel to solicit opinions, and then convenes substitute farmers to conduct evaluations and arrange the work for the next month. At the same time, a mass substitute farming inspection and evaluation campaign is launched in each agricultural season to summarize experience, commend and criticize. All of these have ensured the continuous progress of substitute farming work.

    山西出现许多代耕工作的模范村和模范组
    山西省各地在一九五一年的优抚工作中，出现了许多代耕工作模范村和模范代耕组，使烈属、军属的土地获得了丰收，有的超过了当地一般农民耕地的收获量。例如武乡县的窑上沟村，全村代耕的一百十二亩秋地，每亩平均产量一石七斗五升，超过群众耕地平均产量五升；比一九五○年产量提高了三斗七升。壶关县五区东柏林村，全村代耕地二百七十一亩三分，每亩平均产粮一石六斗五升六，超过一般群众产量（一石五斗）将近一斗六升。崞县八区白塔岗村张宏西所领导的代耕小组，包耕军属张春秀的七亩地，由于精耕细作，一九五一年产量超过了通常产量百分之三十五。——这个村本来是重灾村，一般群众的收成只有通常产量的六成。其他像左权四区的大林口村、高平四区的雍万村等处，烈属军属的土地都得到了丰收；长治原家庄原何金代耕组、潞城郭小牛代耕组等给烈属、军属代耕土地的收获，都超过了一般群众的产量。
    这些地方因为代耕工作做得好，就保证了烈属、军属的生活，直接增强了抗美援朝的力量。武乡窑上沟村的烈属、军属，都已经过着富裕的生活，三分之一的烈属、军属有余粮十石以上。壶关东柏林村一九五一年秋收之后，烈属军属都非常高兴，二十五户烈属军属捐献了五十三万元购买飞机大炮，并有十三户军属向在部队中的亲人写信，报告代耕情况，鼓励他们在前方安心杀敌。
    这些地方做好了代耕工作的主要原因，首先是在于加强了对农民群众的爱国主义教育，提高了大家爱祖国、爱人民军队的热情，使他们认识到代耕工作的重要。武乡窑上沟村自从开展了抗美援朝爱国主义的教育以后，全村二百多户，订了三十七份报纸，成立了二十七个读报组和十八处民校，并有三十六名宣传员经常向群众进行宣传教育。全村人人都知道：“志愿军保卫咱们过太平日子，咱们也要保证为志愿军家属种好庄稼。”“没有解放军就没有咱。”大家对优抚工作非常重视，把保证代耕土地产量达到一般先进户的生产水平列入爱国公约，并在六月份订出了半年的优属代耕工作的详细计划，向全省各代耕组、代耕人提出挑战。各地农民纷纷响应，普遍把做好代耕工作订入了爱国公约，展开了规模空前的优属代耕竞赛运动。
    其次是实行了包工包产的代耕制度，使代耕土地有专人或专组负责，所以在耕作时，都能做到“先军属后自己”，精耕细作，加工加肥；同时固定代耕使代耕人能把代耕工作和自己的生产事先做出统一的计划，科学地安排时间和组织劳动力，使代耕土地和自己的土地能普遍丰产。
    第三是深入检查和进行评比竞赛，奖励或表扬模范、批评或处分落后的代耕人，鼓舞了群众的情绪。例如武乡县在一九五一年夏天曾举行全县的代耕工作大检查，各区、村分别召开优抚委员会会议，并吸收烈属、军属、革命残废军人和群众的代表参加，组织代耕工作委员会，深入田间进行视察，发现好坏典型，通过黑板报、广播筒等进行表扬、批评。窑上沟村规定每半月检查一次代耕工作，并随时进行抽查。村优抚委员会并每月召开一次烈属、军属会议征求意见，然后召集代耕户进行评比并布置下月的工作。同时，在每个农业季节，发动一次群众性的代耕检查、评比运动，总结经验，进行表扬和批评。这些，都保证了代耕工作的不断前进。
