Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 7th: Tabrani, the head of the Indonesian People's Observation Delegation who was invited to participate in our country's 1951 National Day celebrations, and members Penny and Balion, upon returning to Indonesia, separately met with journalists and published serialized travel notes in newspapers, describing their impressions of the New China.

Tabrani said when meeting with journalists in Jakarta: "New China has made rapid progress in all aspects and is now a world power." He talked about the delegation's free visits to cities such as Shenyang, Tianjin, and Shanghai, as well as rural areas. He said: In Shenyang, we visited the countryside and saw the prosperous atmosphere of the rural areas. New houses were being built in the villages. People's complexions were ruddy. There were abundant grain reserves in their homes. Attention was also paid to cleanliness and hygiene. These situations prove how much the land reform has improved the lives of Chinese farmers.

After Penny spoke freely to the journalists about his impressions of New China, he said: "China and Indonesia are countries with historical relations, and both countries have suffered from the cruel oppression of imperialism. Therefore, we must strengthen the ties and understanding between each other in the future."

In his speech, Balion particularly emphasized his deep impression of the Chinese people's love for peace after visiting New China. He said: China needs peace and eagerly looks forward to peace. They know that only by actively striving for peace can there be true peace. Therefore, when the American army hit the Yalu River and American planes invaded Northeast China, the Chinese people organized volunteers to go to Korea. They love peace, but they also cherish the fruits of victory.

Tabrani published a serialized travelogue in the "Observer." Penny published his "Travels in New China" in the "Independent." Balion published his "Eyewitness Account of New China" in the "Newspaper." Other Indonesian newspapers also published their articles and talks. They all used the facts they saw with their own eyes to refute the shameless slanders of imperialism and its running dogs against New China.

    印尼人民观礼代表团返国后
    广泛介绍我国的繁荣景象
    【新华社七日讯】雅加达消息：应邀参加我国一九五一年国庆节庆典的印度尼西亚人民观礼代表团团长塔勃兰尼、团员潘尼和巴里昂，在回到印尼后曾分别接见新闻记者，并在报纸上发表连载游记，叙述他们对新中国的观感。
    塔勃兰尼在雅加达接见新闻记者时说：“新中国在各方面都有飞跃的进步，现在已经是世界强国了。”他谈到代表团在沈阳、天津、上海等城市以及农村自由地进行访问的情形。他说：在沈阳时，我们曾访问农村，看到农村的繁荣气象。村庄里，一栋栋的新房屋建筑起来。人们的脸色都是红润的。家里存粮很多。清洁卫生也很讲究。这些情形证明了土地改革对中国农民生活的改善有着多大的影响。
    潘尼对新闻记者们畅谈对新中国的印象以后说：“中国和印尼是有历史关系的国家，两国又曾同受帝国主义的残酷压迫。因此，今后必须加强彼此间的联系和了解。”
    巴里昂在谈话中特别强调他在访问新中国后对中国人民热爱和平的深刻印象。他说：中国需要和平，殷切期待和平。他们知道只有积极地争取和平，才能有真正的和平。因此，在美国军队打到鸭绿江边，美国飞机侵入中国东北的时候，中国人民组织了志愿军开到朝鲜去。他们爱好和平，但是他们也珍惜着胜利的果实。
    塔勃兰尼在“观察报”发表了连载游记。潘尼在“独立报”发表了他的“新中国纪行”。巴里昂在“新报”发表了他的“新中国目击记”。印尼的其他报纸也刊载了他们的文章和谈话。他们都用亲眼看到的事实，驳斥了帝国主义及其走狗对新中国的无耻诬蔑。
