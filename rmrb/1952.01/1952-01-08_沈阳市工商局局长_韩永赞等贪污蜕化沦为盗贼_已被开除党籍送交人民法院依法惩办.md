    Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce Director
    Han Yongzan and Others Embezzle, Degenerate, and Become Thieves
    Expelled from the Party and Handed Over to the People's Court for Legal Punishment
    During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Shenyang, several major embezzlement cases were discovered. The major embezzlement case headed by Han Yongzan, director of the Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, was one of them.
    In addition to Han Yongzan, those involved in this major embezzlement case included Deputy Director Sun Yi, Commerce and Administration Section Chief Shen Yang, and Market Section Chief Du Rui. They were all Communist Party members with about ten years of struggle experience, and they had made certain contributions to the cause of the Party and the people in the past. However, after entering the big city, under the influence of bourgeois ideology, they had become corrupt and degenerate, and had become thieves who colluded with private merchants to steal state property.
    The Bureau of Industry and Commerce is one of the organs that specifically implements national financial and economic policies and industrial and commercial policies. However, when the state stipulated that private merchants were not allowed to transport steel into the customs area, Han Yongzan, director of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and others, more than once, used the name of the department store and the certificate of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce to help private merchants steal steel from state-owned enterprises, and sent their own cadres to help private merchants transport the steel to Tianjin for sale; later, they simply colluded with private merchants and engaged in the business of trafficking in steel together. According to recently confirmed materials: In September 1949, one steel trafficking alone yielded a profit of 8.2 billion Northeast currency; they split the money equally with the private merchants. In February of last year, private merchant Wang Deshun obtained a certificate from Sun Yi and purchased 13 train cars of round steel and scrap steel from Anshan Iron and Steel Company at one time, and transported them to Tianjin in the name of the workers' cooperative of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. After the anti-corruption and anti-degeneration movement was launched last winter, it was discovered that a person named "Han Kangzan" had 2,000 tons of scrap steel worth more than 4 billion yuan in RMB piled up at Huanggu District Railway Station. It is understood that this is also related to Han Yongzan. According to preliminary inspection results, it is confirmed that Han Yongzan and others embezzled 9.7 billion yuan in Northeast currency before and after trafficking in steel, and the profits earned (with accounts to check) amounted to more than 9 billion yuan in Northeast currency. In addition, Han Yongzan also used various speculative methods to seek profits. He took money from one company and put it on account in another company to seek profits. However, fearing exposure, he asked his car driver Xu Zhongmin to use the pseudonym "Xu Zhongmin" to deposit money in the trust company under the Bureau of Industry and Commerce to earn interest. From April 15th to June 24th, 1950, he earned a profit of more than 126 million yuan in RMB. In July last year, he deposited more than 1.427 billion yuan in RMB in the name of "Xu Zhongmin." These deposits mostly came from steel trafficking dividends, market section fines, exchange public funds, and department store remittances. To date, the trust company's account still has a deposit of more than 4.88 billion yuan in Northeast currency from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. However, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce does not know where this account comes from. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce has no accounts, only boxes of receipts, which are impossible to check.
    Han Yongzan also "mobilized" his whole family to steal.
    Han Yongzan's family was originally a large landlord, but he said that "the family is now in great difficulty," so he borrowed public funds in his father's name to open a grain consignment store. Before the opening, Han Yongzan specifically instructed his subordinates—the cadres of the grain company—to give "care." How much and how "care" was given over the past year has not yet been fully clarified, but it is only known that when state-owned grain stores stipulated that the amount of flour sold to cooperatives should not exceed 80 bags at a time, Han's family grain store could buy 900 bags at a time; the Bureau of Industry and Commerce had stipulated that general consignment stores were not allowed to do wholesale business, and that the proceeds from the sale of grain must be returned on the same day, but Han's family grain store could not implement this. What is even more intolerable is the evasion of state taxes. According to the public account books of Han's family grain store, from January to September last year, the profit was more than 71.42 million yuan in RMB, and the tax payable was more than 23.34 million yuan, but he only paid 4.34 million yuan, less than 20 percent of the tax payable. Han Yongzan defended himself by saying, "This is not tax evasion, the shortfall was exempted by the government." Han Yongzan's uncle also opened a grain consignment store without any capital. Han Yongzan's younger brother obtained a business license to open a gold shop with only half an ounce of gold as capital. What kind of speculative activities this "gold shop" is engaged in is still a "secret."
    In addition to stealing state property with his whole family, Han Yongzan also ruined some cadres with wavering wills. Shen Yang, chief of the Commerce and Administration Section of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, was a major offender in selling gold. He had successively smuggled and resold 28 "small treasures" of gold. When Shen Yang went to Beijing to attend a meeting and returned home to sweep the tombs and worship his ancestors, he carried more than a dozen "small treasures" with him, saying that this was engaging in "sideline production." Shen Yang also helped private merchants transport iron into the customs area. According to him, he received a bribe of 120 million yuan in Northeast currency from private merchants for transporting iron once. The theft method of Du Rui, chief of the Market Section, was even more "clever." When he was handling a case of a certain illegal merchant, he should have been fined 300 million yuan according to the law. However, the treacherous merchant was unwilling to admit the fine, so Du Rui shouted loudly, "If you don't accept it, it will be indispensable tomorrow!" The cunning merchant understood and quietly sent 100 million yuan to Du Rui's father at night. Two days later, the fine was reduced from 300 million yuan to 100 million yuan.
    Accepting gifts from merchants has become a common practice in the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. But Han Yongzan and others shirked their responsibility and said, "This is voluntary by the merchants, not what I wanted."
    Han Yongzan and others completely undermined the state's cadre policy and personnel system. He casually introduced private individuals without any organizational review or approval, which has become another unhealthy trend in the Bureau of Industry and Commerce system. Only Han Yongzan and his wife introduced 40 "cadres" to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and its affiliated units, including a "major general" of the Chiang bandit army and a special agent of the Kuomintang "Secret Service Bureau," some of whom have been arrested or shot in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Han Yongzan and others also knew that this group of people was heavily in debt of blood, but he had completely lost his revolutionary spirit and insisted on placing these counter-revolutionary elements in positions involving economic secrets. To cover up his scandal, Han Yongzan shamelessly fabricated a fallacy, saying: "When using cadres, don't just look at politics." Sun Yi also said: "Don't just look at the past, but also look at the current achievements."
    Han Yongzan and others are licentious, shameless, decadent, and completely hopeless in their lives.
    In addition to eating and drinking extravagantly, Han Yongzan and other embezzlers often ate expensive "deer antler extract" and "glucose." During festivals, Han Yongzan and Sun Yi also accepted gifts worth 7 to 8 million yuan. When cadres raised objections to them, Han Yongzan even resisted, saying: "Since ancient times, officials don't hit gift-givers."
    According to the government's establishment, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Bureau of Health shared a car. However, Han Yongzan and others first obtained a jeep, and then changed it four times in a year; finally, they felt that the "Ford" car was uncomfortable, so they newly purchased a "Chrysler" sedan equipped with heating, air conditioning, and a radio. Han Yongzan and Sun Yi's dormitories were very "exquisite," and even the nanny's bedroom was decorated with beautiful sofas. The renovation of dormitories in various organs is very difficult, but Han and Sun built cement roads to their doors, built fountains in the courtyard, and added toilets and bathtubs in the rooms. Han Yongzan also put the large carpets, grand pianos, and radios sold by the department store, and the cameras of the trust company, in his own home for long-term
    "borrowing."
    Han Yongzan and others were not satisfied with this "lavish" (essentially dirty) food, clothing, housing, and transportation, their desires were rising, and they were endless. Han Yongzan was a married man with a wife and several children. However, when he went to the department store for "inspection," he took a fancy to a female staff member named Dong Ping, so he issued an "order" to transfer her to work at the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. Without asking about her political background, Han Yongzan first introduced her to join the Communist Youth League (which was not approved), and then took her to Beijing to attend a national production and sales conference, often taking her to dance and watch movies, and openly entering and leaving public and private places and organs. Treacherous merchants such as Lu Guangji, after learning about the temperament of Han Yongzan, the "director," from time to time sent cars to pick up and drop off Dong Ping for Han Yongzan. For such hopeless corrupt and degenerate elements, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in addition to expelling him from the party, arrested him on December 20th last year and sent him to the People's Court for legal punishment. Du Rui and Shen Yang have been sentenced to 13 years in prison by the court
    (have been expelled from the party). Sun Yi is being processed.

    沈阳市工商局局长
    韩永赞等贪污蜕化沦为盗贼
    已被开除党籍送交人民法院依法惩办
    沈阳市在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，曾发现一些重大贪污案。以沈阳市工商局局长韩永赞为首的大贪污案，就是其中之一。
    这一大贪污案的有关人员，除韩永赞外，还有副局长孙毅、商政科科长沈阳、市场科科长杜锐等。他们都是已有十年左右斗争历史的共产党员，过去对党和人民的事业都有一定的功绩；但进入大城市后，在资产阶级思想影响下，已经腐化堕落，并变为勾结私商、盗窃国家财产的盗贼。
    工商局是具体执行国家财政经济政策和工商业政策的机关之一。但当国家规定不准私商贩运钢铁进关的时候，工商局局长韩永赞等人却不止一次地用百货公司的名义和工商局的证明，帮助私商从国营企业里盗取钢铁，并派自己的干部帮助私商把钢铁运到天津出售；后来就索性和私商结伙，一同从事贩卖钢铁的买卖。据最近已证实的材料：一九四九年九月，一次贩铁就得利东北币八十二亿元；他们把这钱和私商对半平分了。去年二月，私商王德顺从孙毅手里拿到证明，一次从鞍山钢铁公司购得元钢、废铁十三车箱（火车），并用工商局职工合作社的名义运往天津。去年冬季反对贪污蜕化运动展开后，又发现有一位叫“韩康赞”的，在皇姑屯车站堆积着价值人民币四十多亿元的废铁两千吨。据了解这与韩永赞也有关系。据初步检查结果证实：韩永赞等为贩卖钢铁前后挪用公款东北币九十亿又七千万元，所赚利润（有账可查的）就有东北币九十多亿元。另外，韩永赞还采用了各种各样投机方法牟利。他从这个公司拿上钱，到另一公司放账牟利。但他怕暴露自己，又叫他的汽车司机许忠民化名为“徐仲民”，在工商局属下的信托公司存款吃利。从一九五○年四月十五日到六月二十四日，就得利人民币一亿二千六百多万元。去年七月，又以“徐仲民”的名义存入人民币十四亿二千七百多万元。这些存款多是来自贩铁分红、市场科罚款、交易所公款和百货公司的上缴利润等。到目前为止，信托公司的账上，还有工商局的一笔东北币四十八亿八千多万元的存款。但工商局却不知这笔账来自何处。工商局没有账，只有一箱一箱的单据，查都无从查起。
    韩永赞还“动员”他全家人来进行盗窃。
    韩永赞家里原是大地主，他却说“现在家里很困难”，于是用他父亲的名义，借公家款开了一个粮食代销店。开张前，韩永赞特别嘱咐他的部下——粮食公司的干部们加以“照顾”。一年多来“照顾”了多少和怎样“照顾”的，现在还没有完全弄清楚，只知道当国营粮店规定卖给合作社的面粉一次不得超过八十袋的时候，韩家粮店却一次可以买到九百袋；工商局曾规定一般代销店不准做批发买卖，而且必须当天交回所卖粮款，但韩家粮店可以不执行。更使人不能容忍的是偷漏国税。按韩家粮店的公开账本计算，去年一月到九月盈利人民币七千一百四十二万多元，应纳税二千三百三十四万多元，但他只纳税四百三十四万元，不足应纳税款的百分之二十。韩永赞辩护说：“这不是偷税，不足数是政府给免的。”韩永赞的叔叔，也没有拿一点资本就开设了一个粮食代销店。韩永赞的弟弟，则仅以半两黄金的资本，取得了开设金店的营业执照。究竟这个“金店”干些什么投机倒把的勾当，至今还是一个“秘密”。
    韩永赞除了全家盗窃国家财产之外，又毁灭了一些意志不坚定的干部。工商局商政科长沈阳，就是贩卖黄金的大犯。他曾先后走私倒卖黄金“小宝”二十八个。沈阳到北京开会，回家扫坟祭祖，身边都带着十几个“小宝”，说这是搞“副业生产”。沈阳还帮私商运铁进关。仅据他自己说：给私商运铁一次就受贿东北币一亿二千万元。市场科长杜锐的盗窃方法，更是“巧妙”。他在处理某一违法商人的案件时，按照法令应当罚款三亿元。但这个奸商不愿认罚，杜锐便大声吆喝说：“你不服，明天也少不了！”狡猾的奸商会意，夜晚便悄悄送给杜锐的父亲一亿元。过了两天，所科罚金一下由三亿元降为一亿元。
    接受商人礼物，在工商局已经成了普遍的风气。但韩永赞等则推卸责任地说：“这是商人自动自愿的，不是我要的。”
    韩永赞等完全破坏了国家的干部政策和人事制度。他不经任何组织审查和批准，就随便介绍私人，这已成为工商局系统的另一歪风。仅韩永赞和他爱人介绍到工商局和它所属的单位的“干部”便有四十名，其中有蒋匪军的“少将”、国民党“保密局”的特务，有的已在镇压反革命中被逮捕或枪毙了。韩永赞等也知道这伙人血债累累，但他已完全丧失革命性，硬把这些反革命分子安置在有关经济机密的岗位上。韩永赞为掩饰他的丑行，还无耻地制造了一种谬论说：“使用干部不要只从政治上看。”孙毅也说：“不要只看过去，也应看看现在的成绩。”
    韩永赞等在生活上是荒淫无耻、腐朽透顶，已完全不可救药了。
    韩永赞等贪污分子除大吃大喝外，还经常吃价值高昂的“鹿茸素”、“葡萄糖”。逢年过节，韩永赞和孙毅还要接受价值七、八百万元的礼物。当干部向他们提出意见时，韩永赞竟抗拒地说：“自古官家不打送礼人。”
    按照政府的编制，工商局和卫生局伙用一部汽车。但韩永赞等先弄了一部吉普车，又在一年内换了四次；最后还嫌“福特”式的车不舒服，又新购了一部装有暖气、冷风、收音机的“苦雷斯拉”式轿车。韩永赞和孙毅的宿舍很“讲究”，连保姆的卧室里都陈列着漂亮的沙发。各机关的宿舍，修缮十分不易，而韩、孙二人却把洋灰马路修到自己的门口，院里修建了喷水池，室内增设了便池和浴池。韩永赞还把百货公司出卖的大地毯、大钢琴、收音机，信托公司的照像机，都摆在自己的家里，长期
    “借”用着。
    韩永赞等人，并不以这种“阔绰”的（实质上是肮脏的）衣食住行为满足，他们的欲望是水涨船高，永无穷尽的。韩永赞已是有妻子的丈夫，好几个儿女的父亲。但他到百货公司“视察”时，一眼看中了一个叫董萍的女工作人员，于是一道“命令”，把她调到工商局工作。不问她的政治面貌和背景，韩永赞初则介绍她加入青年团（未被通过），继又带她到北京出席全国性的产销会议，经常带她跳舞、看电影，公开进出于公私场所和机关。奸商卢广绩之流，摸到韩永赞“局长”的脾气，就不时派汽车替韩永赞迎送董萍。对于这样已不可救药的贪污蜕化分子，中共沈阳市委除开除他的党籍外，并在去年十二月二十日把他逮捕起来送到人民法院依法惩办。杜锐和沈阳已被法院判处十三年徒刑
    （在党内已被开除党籍）。孙毅正被处理中。
