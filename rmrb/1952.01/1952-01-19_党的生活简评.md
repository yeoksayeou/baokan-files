Brief Commentary on Party Life

Cleansing the Filth of the Exploiting Classes and Purifying Our Fighting Ranks

Han Linguang, Deputy Secretary of the Seventh District Committee of the CCP Beijing Municipal Committee and concurrently Head of the Seventh District People's Government, was expelled from the Party and dismissed from his position as District Head due to corruption, degeneration, and ideological depravity. This decision by the Party and the government is entirely correct.

The amount of money Han Linguang embezzled was not particularly large. Why then, was he given such a severe punishment?

The problem lies in the nature of the embezzlement and Han Linguang's ideological deterioration.

First, he handled over 5 million yuan in subsidies for the families of cadres, but he embezzled and squandered over 3 million yuan from it, accounting for about 60 percent of the total amount. This sum was specifically intended to alleviate the difficulties of some cadre families, but he embezzled it for personal extravagance, disregarding the illnesses and hardships of the cadres' families, leaving many of their problems unresolved. How base, shameless, and heartless! Moreover, the fact that he dared to openly embezzle 60 percent of such a sum shows the extent to which his character had deteriorated.

Secondly, participation in the donation campaign to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is a concrete manifestation of patriotism. Han Linguang initially donated 120,000 yuan to put on a show, but he quickly revealed his true colors, reaching out his dirty hands and extracting 80,000 yuan from it. In his heart, besides pursuing dirty money, he had virtually no patriotic thoughts at all, let alone communist ideology!

Third, Han Linguang, as a Communist Party member, had been selfish and exploited the fruits of land reform struggles by deceiving peasants at low prices while working in rural areas. After entering the city, he not only became eroded by bourgeois ideology but further developed it, degenerating into embezzling public funds, colluding with private merchants, and everywhere "investing" to plunder surplus value. He has demonstrated through his actions that his ideology has been bourgeoisified, that he is no longer a Communist Party member, and that he completely lacks the spirit of a Communist Party member.

Fourth, during the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, despite repeated urging from the Party and the government to reflect, Han Linguang not only failed to deeply examine himself and correct his mistakes but also persisted in his wrongdoing, resisted the movement, and stubbornly refused to reform. How can such a degenerated element, deeply poisoned by the filth of the exploiting classes, be allowed to remain in the advanced ranks of the proletariat?

Expelling Han Linguang from the Party is precisely to purify the Party ranks, maintain the Party's strong fighting power, victoriously repel the bourgeoisie's offensive, and welcome the construction tasks of our great motherland.

    党的生活简评
    清除剥削阶级的污毒纯洁我们战斗的队伍
    中共北京市第七区区委副书记兼第七区人民政府区长韩林光，因贪污腐化，思想堕落被开除党籍、撤销区长职务。党和政府的这一决定是完全正确的。
    韩林光贪污的数目并不太大，为什么要给他这样严厉的处分呢？
    问题就在于贪污的性质和韩林光的思想蜕化。
    第一，他所过手的干部家属救济粮折款不过五百多万元，可是他却从中贪污挥霍了三百多万元，约占款数总额的百分之六十。而这笔款项本是用于解决一部分干部家属困难的专款，他却贪污了这笔款项，供个人挥霍，置干部家属的疾病困苦于不顾，致使许多干部家属的困难无法解决。看这是多么卑鄙无耻和多么没有心肝！同时对于这样一宗款项竟敢公然贪污了全数的百分之六十，也可以看出他的品质已恶劣到什么程度。
    其次，参加抗美援朝的捐献运动，本是一个人爱国主义的具体表现。韩林光开始为了装点门面，也捐了十二万元，可是很快就暴露原形，伸出脏手，抽取了其中的八万元。他的心里，除了追逐肮脏的钱财外，简直连一点点爱国主义的思想都没有了，那里还有共产主义思想呢！
    第三，韩林光身为共产党员，过去在农村工作的时候，就自私自利以低价骗取农民的土地改革斗争果实。入城以后，不仅受了资产阶级思想侵蚀，并且进一步发展了资产阶级思想，堕落到贪污公款，勾结私商，到处“入股”掠夺剩余价值。他已用行动说明他的思想已经资产阶级化了，已经不是一个共产党员了，已经完全没有共产党员的气味了。
    第四，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，虽经党和政府多方促其反省，但韩林光不但不深自反省，痛改前非，而且怙恶不悛，对这个运动实行抵抗，顽固地拒绝改造。像这样深中剥削阶级污毒的蜕化分子，还有什么理由可以让他留在无产阶级先进的队伍中呢！
    清除韩林光出党，正是为了纯洁党的队伍，保持党的坚强战斗力，以胜利击退资产阶级的进攻，迎接我们伟大祖国的建设任务。
