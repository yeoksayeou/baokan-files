Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 3rd (TASS): U.S. Communist Party National Committee Secretary Hall was given an additional three-year prison sentence by the U.S. Federal Court on December 27th of last year.

As early as October 21, 1949, Hall and ten other leaders of the American Communist Party were sentenced by the New York Federal Court to five years in prison and a fine of 10,000 U.S. dollars in the name of allegedly violating the fascist "Smith Act." Last June, the U.S. judicial authorities arrested the other ten leaders of the American Communist Party to carry out their sentences, but Hall refused to serve his sentence. In October of the same year, Hall was arrested in Mexico. At that time, the U.S. judicial authorities plotted to add a new prison sentence to Hall and "prosecute" Hall again.

Federal Judge Ryan, in this sentencing, insisted that Hall had committed two different "contempt of court" crimes, and therefore, specially added a three-year prison sentence. This sentence will be carried out after Hall's five-year sentence, which was falsely accused of violating the "Smith Act," expires.

    美共领袖霍尔
    竟被非法加判三年徒刑
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：美国共产党全国委员会书记霍尔在去年十二月二十七日被美国联邦法院加判了三年徒刑。
    早在一九四九年十月二十一日，霍尔就和美国共产党其他十名领袖被纽约联邦法院以所谓违犯法西斯的“史密斯法”为名，判处了五年徒刑和一万美元的罚金。去年六月，美国司法当局逮捕了其他十名美国共产党的领袖，执行徒刑，但是霍尔拒绝服刑。同年十月，霍尔在墨西哥被捕。当时，美国司法当局就策划加判霍尔以新的徒刑，对霍尔再次“起诉”。
    联邦法官赖恩在这次宣判时，硬说霍尔犯了两项不同的“蔑视法院罪”，因此，特加判三年徒刑。这项徒刑将在霍尔因被诬违犯“史密斯法”而被判处的五年徒刑刑期届满之后，继续执行。
