Wu Xuanwen, a labor model from Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, created a high-yield record last year of 881 jin of seed cotton per mu. This yield is seven times higher than the average cotton field in the local area and more than eleven times higher than the average yield of cotton fields in the entire Central and South China region. This yield is the highest among cotton fields in the Yangtze River Basin and only second to Qu Yaoli's cotton field yield in the entire country. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Central and South Military and Political Committee, and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government recently sent personnel to conduct on-the-spot investigations of Wu Xuanwen's high-yield experience. They believe that his high-yield experience is particularly suitable for promotion in the cotton-growing areas of the rainy Yangtze River Basin. In addition to paying attention to seed selection, sowing, seedling setting, weeding, and timely pest control, Wu Xuanwen also pays attention to rain prevention and drainage under the natural conditions of Jiangnan. The following are Wu Xuanwen's main cotton planting experiences:

	(1) Adopting deep plowing with high ridges, ditch drainage, and covering with "fire manure" to prevent rain and protect seedlings. Cotton is most afraid of excessive rain after sowing, and the cotton sowing season in Jiangnan coincides with the rainy season. Therefore, Wu Xuanwen attaches great importance to drainage and seedling protection. His cotton fields are terraced fields on hills with deep sandy loam soil. He uses the Anhui Tongcheng-style large plow for plowing, which can plow half an inch deeper than the local ordinary small plows. After plowing, he spreads 400 jin of dried lake grass (aquatic plants from Poyang Lake) as base fertilizer, and then plows again to break up the soil clods and create small ridges about one zhang wide. Deep ditches are opened around the small ridges to facilitate drainage. Last year, his cotton was sown four days before the Beginning of Summer. The cotton seeds were selected to be full and uniform, and they were soaked and mixed with plant ash before sowing. He sows using the plum blossom-style dibbling method, with a sowing depth of about five fen, and covers it with a thin layer of "fire manure" after sowing. "Fire manure" is a dry manure made by burning and mixing cow dung with dried pond mud, dry grass, or rice husks. Wu Xuanwen believes that covering cotton seeds with fire manure has many benefits: first, it can avoid soil crusting during periods of heavy spring rain, and on sunny days, it can protect the germinated cotton seeds from being scorched by the sun. Second, the fertilizer and heat contained in the fire manure promote the germination of cotton seeds. Last spring, Jiangxi experienced continuous rain and cold weather, and the phenomenon of seed rotting and missing seedlings was common in cotton fields in various places. The seedling emergence rate in Ruichang County's cotton fields was only 30%. In general cotton fields in Pengze County, due to poor drainage and failure to cover with fire manure, the ground crusted after the rain, resulting in incomplete and uneven seedling emergence, and the emergence was very slow. Wu Xuanwen's cotton fields had complete seedling emergence six days after sowing. Wu Xuanwen's cotton fields practice early "thinning" and late "seedling setting." Wu Xuanwen started thinning four or five days after the cotton seedlings emerged, and seized the opportunity to weed after the rain, promoting the normal development of the cotton seedlings. Therefore, there was no missing seedling phenomenon in Wu Xuanwen's cotton fields.

	(2) There is a lot of rain in Jiangnan in spring and summer, so Wu Xuanwen attaches great importance to drainage during the early stages of cotton seedling growth. However, in July and August, when the cotton is forming bolls, Jiangnan is often hot and dry, and the evaporation from the ground and cotton leaves is very rapid. At this time, Wu Xuanwen attaches great importance to irrigation, soil cultivation, and grass covering to resist drought and protect seedlings. Local farmers generally mistakenly believe that watering will kill cotton plants and have never had the habit of irrigating cotton fields. Last summer, Jiangxi suffered a severe drought, and cotton fields generally suffered from drought and reduced yields. Wu Xuanwen, based on natural laws and the guidance of government technical cadres, broke with old habits and irrigated with liquid manure twice. When the cotton seedlings grew to more than one chi high, he cultivated the soil around the roots of the cotton plants to a height of about five cun while weeding. When the cotton seedlings grew to one chi five or six cun high, he cultivated the soil again, making the cotton plants deeply rooted in the soil, which was both drought-resistant and wind-resistant. In July and August, when the cotton plants showed signs of dryness due to drought, Wu Xuanwen immediately irrigated the cotton fields with liquid manure. This liquid manure is a very dilute mixture of human urine and manure (one bucket of water to one ladle of manure), which has a better drought resistance effect than water. Cotton plants that appeared dry quickly regained their vitality and turned green after being irrigated with liquid manure. However, the liquid manure must be very dilute, otherwise, the cotton plants will experience excessive vegetative growth. After watering with liquid manure, Wu Xuanwen also covered the roots of the cotton plants with lake grass to reduce ground evaporation. Last year, the cotton fields in Pengze County experienced premature ripening and flower and bud drop due to drought, resulting in reduced yields, but Wu Xuanwen's cotton fields were not affected by the drought.

	(3) Last year, Wu Xuanwen planted the newly introduced Daizi No. 15 cotton variety. This cotton is a good variety suitable for the natural conditions of Jiangnan. Its characteristics are: tall cotton plants, many branches, and many bolls. However, this cotton needs deep roots and sufficient fertilizer. Therefore, Wu Xuanwen paid special attention to cultivating soil fertility and fertilizing. He believes that the best pre-crop for cotton is broad beans. He said, "Cotton thrives after broad beans" because broad beans are leguminous plants that can use rhizobia to produce nitrogen fertilizer and improve soil fertility. In terms of fertilization, last year, Wu Xuanwen's high-yield cotton field used 400 jin of dried lake grass and 25 dan of fire manure per mu as base fertilizer. When the cotton reached the budding stage, Wu Xuanwen also applied 110 jin of soybean cake as top dressing in a timely manner. His method of using soybean cake is to first crush the soybean cake, put it in the manure pit to fully decompose, and then dig holes one by one in the cotton field, apply it together with liquid manure next to the cotton plants three or four cun away, and then cover it with soil. He believes that doing so allows the soybean cake to decompose quickly and meet the needs of cotton during flowering and boll formation. In this way, coupled with pest control, Wu Xuanwen fully developed the advantage of Daizi cotton having many bolls. The cotton planted by local farmers generally has only fourteen or fifteen bolls per plant, while Wu Xuanwen's high-yield cotton field has an average of 75 bolls per plant, with the most reaching 205 bolls.

The investigation team from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Central and South Military and Political Committee, and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, as well as many cotton experts, who investigated Wu Xuanwen's high-yield cotton field, all believe that the yield of Wu Xuanwen's cotton field is likely to increase significantly this year. Last year, Wu Xuanwen was still a single peasant. During busy farming seasons, he could not attend to everything, so he could not cultivate all of his cotton fields well. Last year, only one mu of his cotton field reached a yield of 881 jin of seed cotton, while the yield of the remaining cotton fields was only 30% higher than that of ordinary cotton fields in the local area. Last year, the shortage of agricultural capital, which prevented him from applying sufficient fertilizer to all the cotton fields, was also a major reason. There are some aspects of cotton planting technology that Wu Xuanwen should also improve: First, his cotton fields only plant 1,154 plants per mu, and some cotton plants occupy more than seven square chi, which is a waste of land fertility. Under the natural conditions of Jiangnan, about 1,500 plants per mu can be planted for Daizi cotton. Second, he used less phosphate fertilizer in the fertilizer he used last year, resulting in more than 100 cotton plants in the high-yield cotton field experiencing excessive growth due to excessive nitrogen fertilizer, delaying the maturity period, and thus reducing the yield. If the amount of phosphate fertilizer is appropriately increased, the yield of his cotton field will increase this year. Third, the sowing period can also be appropriately advanced. Last year, it would have been better if he had turned the broad beans into the ground as green manure without waiting for the broad beans to mature. Fourth, he did not prune the cotton plants by pinching off the top shoots last year.

Recently, Wu Xuanwen attended the Labor Model Representative Conference in Pengze County and reported on his cotton high-yield experience. At this meeting, Wu Xuanwen has been selected as a special-class agricultural labor model in Pengze County. Wu Xuanwen's cotton high-yield experience will first be promoted in provinces such as Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. Wu Xuanwen himself will strive to achieve a cotton yield of 1,100 jin of seed cotton per mu this year. He has already used this production increase plan to challenge the labor models in Pengze County. (Xinhua News Agency)

    江西省彭泽县劳动模范吴宣文的棉花丰产经验
    江西省彭泽县劳动模范吴宣文，去年创造了每市亩棉花收籽棉八百八十一斤的丰产纪录。这个产量比当地一般棉田高七倍，比中南全区棉田平均产量高十一倍多。这个产量在长江流域的棉田中是最高的，在全国也只次于曲耀离的棉田产量。中央人民政府农业部、中南军政委员会农林部和江西省人民政府农林厅最近派员实地考察吴宣文的丰产经验后，认为他的丰产经验特别适合在多雨的长江流域的棉区推广。吴宣文植棉除注意选种、播种、定苗、锄草和及时防治虫害以外，在江南的自然条件下，他还注意防雨排水。下面是吴宣文植棉的几个主要经验：
    （1）采用深耕高畦、开沟排水和盖火粪的办法防雨保苗。棉花播种后最怕雨多，而江南棉花播种时正值雨季；因此，吴宣文十分重视排水和保苗的工作。他的棉田是丘陵梯田，是土层深厚的沙质壤土。他耕地用安徽桐城式的大犁，比当地一般小犁可深耕半寸；耕后撒布四百斤干湖草（鄱阳湖的水草）作基肥，再耕一遍，就把土块耙碎，作成很高的约一丈宽的小畦。小畦四周开有深沟，排水便利。去年，他的棉花是在立夏前四天播种的，棉种经过选择，饱满均匀，播种前还浸过和用草木灰拌过。他播种的办法是用梅花式的点播，播种深度约五分，播下后用火粪薄薄盖上一层。“火粪”是一种用牛粪和晒干的塘泥、干草或稻谷糠等烧拌而成的干粪。吴宣文认为用火粪盖棉种好处很多：第一，春雨多时可避免地面板结，晴天也可以保护棉种发芽后不致被烈日晒死。第二，火粪的肥分和所含的热能促进棉种出芽。去年春天江西阴雨连绵，气候寒冷，各地棉田普遍发生烂种、缺苗的现象。瑞昌县的棉田出苗率只有百分之三十，彭泽县的一般棉田因排水不良和未盖火粪，雨后地面板结，出苗不全不齐，而且出苗很慢。吴宣文的棉田播种六天后苗就出齐了。吴宣文的棉田“间苗”早、“定苗”晚；棉田出苗四五天后吴宣文就开始间苗，并抓紧雨后锄苗，促进了棉苗的正常发育。因此，吴宣文的棉田没有缺苗现象。
        （2）江南春夏两季雨多，所以，吴宣文在棉苗幼小时期很重视排水。但是，七八月间棉花结铃的时候，江南往往酷热亢旱，地面和棉花叶面的蒸发都很快，这时，吴宣文又很重视浇灌、培土和盖草等抗旱保苗工作。当地一般农民错误地认为浇水会浇死棉株，一向没有浇灌棉田的习惯。去年夏天江西大旱，棉田普遍受旱减产。吴宣文根据自然规律和人民政府技术干部的指导，打破旧有习惯，浇了两次水粪。当棉苗长到一尺多高时，他在锄苗时在棉株根上培了约五寸高的土。当棉苗长到一尺五、六寸高的时候，他又培了一次土，使棉株拥土深厚，既耐旱又防风。七八月间，棉株受旱微呈干枯状态，吴宣文就立即给棉田浇水粪。这种水粪是一种很稀薄的人粪尿（一桶水一杓粪），抗旱的作用比水好。呈现干枯的棉株，浇水粪后很快就恢复了活力，转为青绿。但是水粪必须很稀薄，不然棉株又会发生徒长现象。浇水粪后，吴宣文还用湖草盖在棉株根上，来减少地面的蒸发。去年，彭泽县的棉田因受旱有的早熟，有的落花落蕾，都减产了，只有吴宣文的棉田没有受旱的影响。
    （3）去年吴宣文所种的是新引进的岱字十五号棉种。这种棉花是适合江南自然条件的好品种，它的特点是：棉株高大，分枝多，结铃多。但是，这种棉花需要扎根深，需要充足的肥料。因此，吴宣文特别注意培养棉田地力和施肥。他认为：棉花的前作以种蚕豆为最好。他说，“蚕豆地，发棉花”，因为蚕豆是豆科植物，可借根瘤菌制造氮素肥料，增进地力。施肥方面：去年，吴宣文的丰产棉田一亩除用了四百斤干湖草和二十五担火粪作基肥以外，到棉花现蕾的时候，吴宣文又及时施了一百一十斤豆饼做追肥。他使用豆饼的方法是先将豆饼打碎，放在粪坑内充分腐熟后，再在棉田逐株挖穴，连同水粪点施在棉株旁边三四寸远的地方，随即盖土。他认为这样做豆饼就能很快的分解，供棉花开花结铃时的需要。这样，再加上防治虫害，吴宣文便充分发展了岱字棉结铃多的优点。当地一般农民所种的棉花每株结铃不过十四五枚，吴宣文丰产棉田每株平均结铃七十五枚，最多的达二百零五枚。
    这次考察吴宣文棉田丰产的中央人民政府农业部、中南军政委员会农林部和江西省人民政府农林厅的考察人员和许多棉作专家都认为：吴宣文的棉田产量今年还有可能大大地提高。去年，吴宣文还是单干农民，农忙时顾此失彼，因此他不可能把他自己的全部棉田都种好。去年他的棉田中只有一亩的产量达到了八百八十一斤籽棉，其余的棉田每亩产量比当地一般棉田只高百分之三十。去年，他短缺农本，不能给所有的棉田施足肥料也是重大的原因。在种棉技术上有些方面吴宣文还应改进：一、他的棉田每亩只种一千一百五十四株，有的棉株占地超过七平方市尺，未免浪费地力。在江南的自然条件下种岱字棉，每亩可种一千五百株左右。二、他去年所用肥料中磷肥较少，以致丰产棉田中有一百多棵棉株因氮肥过多，生长过甚，延迟了成熟期，因而减产。如果适当增加磷肥，今年他的棉田产量还会提高。三、播种期还可适当提早。去年，他如果不等蚕豆成熟，把蚕豆翻入地下当作绿肥更好。四、去年他没有打杈摘心修整棉株。
    最近，吴宣文曾出席彭泽县的劳动模范代表大会，报告他的棉花丰产经验。在这个会上，吴宣文已被选为彭泽县的特等农业劳动模范。吴宣文的棉花丰产经验将首先在江西、湖南、湖北等省推广。吴宣文自己要争取今年每亩棉田产量达到籽棉一千一百斤。他已经用这个增产计划向彭泽县的劳动模范们提出了挑战。　　　　　（新华社）
