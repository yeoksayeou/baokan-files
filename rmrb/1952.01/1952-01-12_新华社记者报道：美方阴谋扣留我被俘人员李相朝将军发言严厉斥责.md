Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th. Our special correspondent reports: At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth item of the Korean armistice talks agenda on January 9th, our representative, General Li Xiangchao, pointed out that the other side's use of so-called "one-for-one exchange" and "voluntary repatriation" as pretexts to conceal their scheme to detain our captured personnel is not something that people with a sense of justice around the world can tolerate. Furthermore, it directly violates the explicit provisions of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, which the other side has repeatedly cited. Article 118 of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War stipulates: "Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities." Article 7 of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War stipulates: "Prisoners of war may in no circumstances renounce the rights secured to them by the present Convention." However, the other side openly demands that our captured personnel declare their renunciation of the right to repatriation. General Li Xiangchao also pointed out that the other side's news reports openly declared that Taiwan had sent one hundred and four instructors to "train" our captured personnel, in preparation for detaining our captured personnel. The other side's representative, General Libby, was speechless, but likened the rights stipulated in the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War to poison, saying that one cannot be forced to take poison. He also said that the other side's own news was unreliable. "If you believe the news, you will be more biased than me. Journalists sometimes do not let facts hinder their good story."

    General Li Xiangchao, in denouncing the other side's absurd arguments and sophistry, said: "In your statement just now, you described the main provisions of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, which you have advocated in the past, as poison, saying that you are unwilling to force others to take poison. Releasing and repatriating prisoners of war after the armistice will not become poison. If releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war is poison, then there is no longer any need for truth, humanitarianism, and peace in the world. In the same statement, you cannot but admit that the release and repatriation of prisoners is an unavoidable obligation of the prisoner's holder. But in order to erase this right, you created this new thing, namely 'voluntary repatriation' and 'free choice.' Your side attempts to use this strange argument to rationalize your continued detention of prisoners of war. Presumably, you would also admit that continuing to detain prisoners of war is not allowed by humanitarianism and is not logically tenable. Therefore, you had to come up with 'voluntary repatriation' and 'free choice.' In order to rationalize your illegitimate claims, you used the sophistry of 'one-for-one exchange' and 'exchange of equal numbers', attempting to use our captured personnel as hostages. Why are hostages so necessary for you? Hostages are not good things, but things that detain and deprive many people of their freedom, creating and forcing many people into misfortune. Therefore, peace-loving people of the world oppose it. We who advocate truth and justice will never accept it either. General Libby said that he knew nothing about the matter of the one hundred and four high-ranking instructors sent from Taiwan. General Libby also invited us to visit. But we don't need to go. I think General Libby should especially take the time to see what kind of play is being performed there, what kind of tragedy, what kind of vicious conspiracy. General Libby, under the method of exchanging prisoners of war letters, we have received more than forty postcards from our captured personnel. Each one has the same words commemorating Christmas, only four or five words in total, and nothing else. You know that Easterners rarely have the habit of celebrating Christmas. This was probably written according to the principle of 'voluntary.' But the impression it gives us is that there is coercion behind it. Based on so many facts, the content of your proposal hides many conspiracies and vicious attempts behind 'voluntary repatriation' and 'free choice,' hiding the attempt to send the prisoners you hold to your ugly friends. The content of your proposal, under the principle of 'one-for-one exchange' and under the principle of 'exchange of equal numbers,' attempts to detain our captured personnel held by you as hostages. The people of the world will oppose your proposal, all the prisoners of war on both sides and their family and friends will oppose your proposal, and curse your proposal. We demand that General Libby abandon the position of detaining hostages and accept the principle of rapid release and repatriation of all prisoners of war. General Libby wants me to rest assured about the whereabouts of one thousand four hundred and fifty-six people, but we cannot rest assured. General Libby also said that I should rest assured about the whereabouts of forty-four thousand two hundred and five people, but after listening to your arguments, we cannot rest assured. For the freedom and happiness of so many people, we will resolutely fight you to the end. Where exactly did these people go? Are these people being used as hostages? Are these people being handled according to the principles of 'voluntary repatriation' and 'free choice'? Are you preparing to hand these people over to your ugly friends? Are these people being 'released' from the prisoner-of-war camps and imprisoned in other prisons? We cannot condone these criminal facts. We must clarify these matters and resolve these matters appropriately. We must have you release and repatriate them. We must give them light and happiness. We must reassure their families and friends. I await your clear answer on this question."

    美方阴谋扣留我被俘人员李相朝将军发言严厉斥责
    【新华社开城十日电】本社特派记者报道：一月九日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表李相朝将军指出对方拿出所谓“一对一的交换”、“自愿遣送”的藉口，企图来掩饰扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋，不是全世界有正义感的人民所能容许的，同时更直接违反了对方自己所一再引用的日内瓦战俘公约的明确条文。日内瓦战俘公约第一一八条规定：“积极敌对行为终止后，战俘应即予释放与遣送，不得迟延。”日内瓦战俘公约第七条规定：“不论在任何情况下，战俘不能声明放弃本公约所赋与的权利。”但对方却公然要求我方被俘人员声明放弃他们的遣返的权利。李相朝将军又指出对方新闻报道中公开宣称台湾派了一百零四个教官来“训练”我方的被俘人员，为扣留我方被俘人员做准备工作。对方代表李比将军无词以对，却把日内瓦战俘公约所规定的权利比作毒药，说是不能强迫服毒。又说是对方自己的新闻不可靠。“如果你相信新闻，你会比我更有偏见。新闻记者有时候是不让事实来阻碍他们的一个好的故事的。”
    李相朝将军在痛斥对方的这种荒谬论点和诡辩时说：“你在刚才的发言中把你们过去所主张的日内瓦战俘公约的主要条款说成是毒药，说是你们不愿意强迫别人吃毒药。在停战后释放和遣送战俘不会成为毒药。如果释放与遣送全部战俘是毒药，那么世界上已经不必要真理、人道主义与和平了。你在同一发言中，也不能不承认释放与遣送俘虏是战俘持有者的不可逃避的义务。但为了抹杀这个权利，你们制造了此次的新东西，即‘自愿遣送’与‘自由选择’。你方企图用这种奇怪的论点来使得你方继续扣留战俘成为合理化。大概你也会承认继续扣留战俘是人道主义所不容许的，逻辑上站不住的，因此，你不得不搬出了‘自愿遣送’和‘自由选择’来。为了使你方的不正当的主张合理化，你方用了‘一比一的交换’与‘同等数目的交换’的诡辩，企图把我方的被俘人员作为人质。为什么人质对于你们是如此地需要呢？人质并不是好东西，而是拘留和剥夺很多人的自由的东西，造成并强迫许多人处于不幸的东西。因此爱好和平的世界人民都反对它。主张真理和正义的我们也决不会接受它的。李比将军说：关于从台湾派来的那批一百零四名高明的教官们的事情，他一点也不知道，李比将军并请我们去参观。但是我们不必去看。我认为李比将军倒是应该特别挤出时间去看一看的，到底在那里是唱的一场什么戏，有些什么悲剧，有些什么凶恶的阴谋。李比将军，在双方交换战俘信件的办法下，我们曾经收到我方被俘人员寄来的四十几张明信片。每张上面都一样地写着纪念圣诞节的字样，通共才四五个字，其他什么也没有写。你知道东方人很少有庆祝圣诞节的习惯。这大概是根据‘自愿’原则写出来的。但是给我们的印象却是那后面有着一种强迫。根据这么多事实看来，你方提案的内容是在‘自愿遣送’和‘自由选择’的后面隐藏着许多阴谋和凶恶的企图，隐藏着把你们所收容的俘虏送交你们的丑恶的朋友的企图。你方提案的内容是在‘一比一交换’的原则下，在‘同等数目交换’的原则下，企图扣留你方收容的我方被俘人员作为人质。全世界的人民会反对你方的提案，双方的全部战俘和他们的家属亲友会反对你方的提案，咒诅你方的提案。我们要求李比将军放弃扣留人质的立场，接受迅速释放和遣送全部战俘的原则。李比将军要我对一千四百五十六人的下落放心，但我们不能放心。李比将军又说对于四万四千二百零五人的下落要我放心，但我听了你的论调，我们就不能放心。为了这么多人的自由和幸福，我们要坚决和你们斗争到底。究竟这些人到那儿去了？把这些人作为人质吗？根据‘自愿遣送’和‘自由选择’的原则处理这些人吗？准备把这些人交给你们丑恶的朋友吗？把这些人从俘虏营里‘释放’出来，关进其他的监狱吗？我们不能默许这些犯罪的事实。我们要把这些事情弄清楚，要把这些事情适当地解决。我们一定要你们将他们释放和遣送。我们必须给他们光明和幸福。我们必须使他们的家属和亲友放心。我等待你关于这问题的明确的答复”。
