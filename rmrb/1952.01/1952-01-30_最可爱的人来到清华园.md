The Most Lovable People Come to Tsinghua Garden

	After lunch on January 24th, the students waited for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Delegation. The cold wind howled, yet people still filled the area from the school gate to the auditorium. At 2:00 PM, the long-awaited Volunteer Army and Korean People's representatives arrived. The students rushed forward and lifted the heroes onto their shoulders, then surged into the auditorium. Upon reaching the stage, the Korean People's representatives, Volunteer Army representatives, and many students embraced tightly. Young Pioneers presented flowers to the Volunteer Army uncles and Korean uncles. The heroes held them in their arms, and the children's little mouths affectionately kissed the heroes' faces, loudly saying, "Uncles, we must wipe out American imperialism!" The hearts of the children and the hearts of the heroes protecting them were closely linked. The students used enthusiastic verses to celebrate the glorious guests:
	
	"Most lovable people,
	You have come!
	We welcome you.
	You have created world miracles,
	Done touching things… We will never forget: who is protecting us, allowing us to live in happiness…"
	
	The students vied to give their most cherished possessions to the most lovable people. Books, clothing, commemorative badges, including over twenty copies of our most beloved "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" that we had enthusiastically ordered, that those who hadn't bought envied, but we gave them to our glorious guests. Eastern European students, representing the people of the Eastern European People's Democracies, presented gifts to the heroes. They spoke in fluent Chinese. They conveyed the love of the Eastern European people for the Chinese and Korean people's armies to the Volunteer Army. The hearts of tens of millions of Korean people brought from Korea, the hearts of the people of the Eastern European People's Democracies thousands of miles away, and the hearts of all the Chinese people, beat as one. Volunteer Army representatives and Korean representatives all spoke. We will always remember: the nineteen-year-old Youth League member, a female nurse, whose legs were broken by a bomb, still sang the "Youth League Song"; the Youth League member soldier Mei Huaiqing sacrificed his beautiful youth to open the path for the attack. We will always remember how Volunteer Army comrades meticulously cherished the motherland's supplies in the tense combat environment. One welcome meeting was like attending a political lesson.
	
	It was already dark, and the representatives had to leave. Everyone was reluctant to see them go, crowding around the cars, some surging into the carriages, countless hands reaching out to the heroes, vying to shake their hands. These were the hands of heroes, hands that had held guns and thrown grenades to kill enemies on the Korean battlefield, hands that had rescued Korean children from burning thatched houses... We tightly gripped these strong hands. Cheers, songs, and slogans rang out all around. A Korean People's Army soldier picked up a child before getting into the car, kissing his lovely little face. The car finally started, and the continuous shouts echoed until the car drove out of the school gate.

    最可爱的人来到清华园
    一月二十四日吃过午饭，同学们就等着志愿军和朝鲜人民代表团了。寒风呼呼地吹着，然而从校门口到大礼堂仍站满了人。下午两点，盼望着的志愿军和朝鲜人民代表到了。同学们涌上去把英雄们抬到自己的肩上，又涌进了礼堂。一到台前，朝鲜人民代表、志愿军代表和很多同学紧紧地拥抱起来。少年儿童队员捧着鲜花，献给了志愿军叔叔和朝鲜的叔叔。英雄们将他们抱在怀里，孩子的小嘴亲热地吻着英雄的脸，大声地说：“叔叔，咱们一定要把美帝国主义消灭！”孩子的心和保卫孩子们的英雄的心紧紧地联在一起。同学们用热烈的诗句欢唱着光荣的客人：
    “最可爱的人，
    你们来啦！
    我们欢迎你们。
    你们创造了世界奇迹，
    做下了动人的事情，……我们决不忘记：是谁保卫我们，使我们生活在幸福中。……”
    同学们争着把最心爱的东西送给最可爱的人。书籍、衣物、纪念章，其中还有二十几本我们最心爱的“毛泽东选集”。我们曾热烈订购过的，没有买到的人曾经羡慕过的“毛泽东选集”，然而我们送给了我们光荣的客人。东欧同学，代表着东欧人民民主国家的人民，向英雄们送礼。他们用流利的中国话讲了话。他们把东欧人民对中朝人民军队的热爱，交给了志愿军。从朝鲜带来的千万朝鲜人民的心，万里之外东欧人民民主国家人民的心，和全中国人民的心，一起跳动着。志愿军代表和朝鲜代表都讲了话。我们永远记住：十九岁的青年团员女护士，炸弹打断了她的双腿，她仍高唱“青年团员之歌”；青年团员战士梅怀清为了打开冲锋的道路，献出了自己的美丽的青春。我们永远记住志愿军同志在紧张战斗的环境里是怎样一点一滴地爱护祖国物资。一次欢迎会，像上了一次政治课。
    天已黑了，代表们不得不回去了。大家都舍不得他们走，拥在汽车旁边有的涌到车厢里，无数的手向英雄们伸出，争先恐后地和他们握手。这是英雄的手，它曾在朝鲜战场上，在炮火中拿过枪，扔过手榴弹杀伤敌人；它曾在燃烧着的茅屋中抢救出朝鲜儿童……我们紧紧握着这坚强的手。四周响起一片欢呼的歌声和口号声。一个朝鲜人民军战士在临上车前抱起了一个小孩，亲着他可爱的小脸。汽车终于开动了，不停的呼喊声，一直响到车子开出了校门。　　（清华大学通讯组）
