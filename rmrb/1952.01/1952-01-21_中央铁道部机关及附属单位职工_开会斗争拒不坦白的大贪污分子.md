(Xinhua News Agency) The staff and workers of the Central Railway Ministry and its affiliated units held a meeting on the 18th to struggle against embezzlers. Gao Wenhan, Yan Hezhong, Lu Xinjing, and Wu Benxi, who were struggled against, are all major embezzlers who have repeatedly refused to confess despite education. They also used various means to sabotage the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in a planned and organized manner. After the meeting vividly exposed their crimes, the masses unanimously demanded that the People's Government severely punish these major embezzlers who refused to confess.

Gao Wenhan, the chief clerk of the Subsidiary Industry Section of the Business Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, was originally a member of the Kuomintang and had participated in reactionary organizations such as the Yiguandao. Before liberation, he consistently engaged in speculation and profiteering. After liberation, he was retained by the People's Government, but he still did not repent and spread reactionary remarks. In September 1950, when the Ministry of Railways planned to start responsible transportation, it needed to order a large number of tarpaulins. Gao Wenhan took the opportunity to collude with Li Tao灏, the manager of the Tianjin Yongyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory, a奸商, to leak the state procurement plan and increase the unit price of tarpaulins, causing the state property to lose nearly 2 billion yuan. He personally embezzled 120 million yuan. After the start of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he first completely burned the relevant赃证.奸商 Li Tao灏 also came to Beijing three times from Tianjin to sign a "攻守同盟" with him, deciding to "jointly keep the secret, never reveal it, and never admit it even if the government forces us to death." They had discussed that Gao would pretend to be active in the movement to divert the struggle target by sacrificing Du Yuanchang, a minor embezzler he had dragged into the water. However, after奸商 Li Tao灏 returned to Tianjin, he was forced to confess his crime of stealing state property with Gao by the increased awareness of the store employees.

Yan Hezhong, the chief of the Timber Section of the Tianjin Materials Supply Office of the Ministry of Railways, has been found to have embezzled a total of 637 million yuan and 55 taels of gold. The tangible losses suffered by state property amounted to 2.94 billion yuan, not including other material losses due to high-priced purchases and poor quality. Yan committed the crime of selling intelligence on the Zhengzhou Railway Administration's material purchase plan to Tianjin Jinshan Foreign Company and accepting a bribe of about 10 million yuan. The cadres under his leadership were all dragged into the water, 100% embezzling and accepting bribes. At the beginning of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he secretly convened a meeting of the cadres originally transferred from the Zhengzhou Bureau, attempting to organize resistance, and signed a "攻守合同" with clerk Liu Shouyi. On January 7, Yan committed the crime of fleeing in fear of punishment and was arrested.

At the accusation meeting, many employees who were framed by Yan Hezhong, Gao Wenhan, and others angrily accused them of being framed. Thunderous shouts of "Demand that the government severely punish major embezzlers!" rang out from the audience from time to time.

Finally, Minister Teng Daiyuan made a summary at the meeting. He said that due to the implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions on the principle of combining leadership with the masses, the masses were quickly mobilized. Now the masses have realized from vivid facts how rampant the bourgeoisie has been in attacking the Communist Party, the working class, and the People's Government in the past three years. He called on all railway workers to fight more heroically and further develop the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, continue to attack major embezzlers, completely eliminate the bourgeois viewpoints and methods in railway management, and strive to further improve the people's railways and realize national industrialization.

    中央铁道部机关及附属单位职工
    开会斗争拒不坦白的大贪污分子
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：铁道部机关及附属单位职工在十八日举行斗争贪污分子大会。被斗争的高文翰、颜和衷、鲁心景、吴本熙都是屡经教育仍然拒不坦白的大贪污分子，他们并且有计划有组织地用各种手段破坏反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动。经过大会活生生地揭发出他们的罪行后，群众一致要求人民政府严厉惩办这些拒不坦白的大贪污分子。
    铁道部商务局附业课主任课员高文翰，原是国民党员，曾经参加一贯道等反动组织，解放前一贯投机倒把。解放以后被人民政府留用，但仍然不知悔
    改，散布反动言论。一九五○年九月铁道部计划开办负责运输时，需要订购大量篷布，高文翰即乘机和奸商天津永镒染织工厂经理李涛灏等勾结，泄露国家采购计划，提高篷布单价，使国家财产损失将近二十亿元。他个人贪污一亿二千万元。反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动开始后，他首先把有关赃证完全烧掉。奸商李涛灏又三次由天津来北京和他订立“攻守同盟”，决定“共同保守秘密，绝不泄露，政府逼问至死不认”。他们曾商议好由高犯在运动中假装积极，以牺牲被他拖下水的小贪污分子杜元昌来转移斗争目标。但是奸商李涛灏回天津后，因为店员觉悟提高，迫使他坦白出了自己和高犯一起盗窃国家财产的罪行。
    铁道部天津材料供应处木材科长颜和衷，贪污国家财产已经查明有据者共有六亿三千七百万元，黄金五十五两。国家财产遭受的有形损失达二十九亿四千万元，其他因高价购货，质量不良的材料损失还不在内。颜犯曾经出卖郑州铁路管理局购置材料计划情报给天津金山洋行，接受贿赂约一千万元。在他领导下的干部，都被拖下了水，百分之百贪污受贿。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始，他即秘密召集原来从郑州局调来的干部开会，企图组织抵抗，并与办事员刘守义订立了“攻守合同”。一月七日颜犯又畏罪潜逃被捕。
    控诉会上，许多被颜和衷、高文翰等陷害的职工愤怒地控诉了被陷害的经过。台下不时发出雷动的此起彼落的呼声：“要求政府严惩大贪污犯！”
    最后，滕代远部长在大会上作了总结，他说，由于贯彻了毛主席指示的领导与群众结合的方针，群众迅速发动起来了。现在群众从活生生的事实中已经认识到三年来资产阶级是如何猖狂地向共产党、工人阶级和人民政府进攻。他号召全体铁路职工要更英勇地斗争下去，更进一步开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，向大贪污分子继续进攻，彻底消除在铁路管理上的资产阶级的观点和方法，为进一步办好人民铁路和实现国家工业化而斗争。
