    Staff of the Timber Factory of Shanxi Provincial Construction Company
    Measured Machines to Improve Production Efficiency, Increasing Annual Production by More Than 500,000 Jin of Millet
    Editor: The staff of the timber factory under the Shanxi Provincial Construction Company, in the process of clearing assets and verifying capital, measured the machines and found that the power of the electric saw was insufficient, affecting the improvement of work efficiency. After everyone's research, they realized that the production was suffering because of the different voltages of the transformer and wiring during the installation of the machine. The staff quickly completed the modification, which improved production efficiency. The electric saw could originally saw only 2.66 square meters of wood per minute, but now it can saw 3.68 square meters. In this way, the daily output of wood can be increased by 48.96 square meters, worth 1,468 jin of millet, and the country can increase its wealth by more than 500,000 jin of millet a year. After this machine measurement, the staff all understood the true meaning of clearing assets and verifying capital. Zhang Xiaoliang

    山西省建筑公司木材厂职工
    测定机器提高生产效率全年增产五十多万斤小米
    编辑同志：山西省建筑公司所属木材厂职工，在清理资产核定资金中测定机器，发现电锯的电力不足，影响了工作效率的提高。经大家研究后，才知道在安装机器时，因变压器和接线的电压不同，致使生产受到损失。职工们很快地把它改装完成，提高了生产效率。这部电锯原来一分钟只能锯木料二点六六平方公尺，现在可锯三点六八平方公尺。这样，每日可增产四十八点九六平方公尺木料，价值小米一千四百六十八斤，一年可给国家增产五十多万斤小米的财富。经过这次测定机器，职工们都知道了清理资产、核定资金的真正意义。张效良
