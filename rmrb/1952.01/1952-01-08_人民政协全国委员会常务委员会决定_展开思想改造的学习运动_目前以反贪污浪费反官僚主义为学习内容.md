Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The 34th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference passed a resolution on launching a study movement for ideological remolding of people from all walks of life. The full text is as follows:

(1) In accordance with the resolution of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the CPPCC and the local consultative committees throughout the country should be responsible for leading people from all walks of life in carrying out the study movement for ideological remolding. In view of the fact that the study in many aspects is already underway under leadership, the CPPCC and the local consultative committees will, for the time being, focus on leading the study of people from democratic parties, non-party figures in governments, people's organizations, and consultative bodies at all levels, experts in government and enterprise organs, people in industry and commerce, and people in religious circles.

(2) Participation in the ideological remolding study led by the CPPCC is based on the principle of voluntariness.

(3) The ideological remolding study includes three basic contents: 1. Studying theory, that is, studying the basic theory of Marxism-Leninism, and studying Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese revolution, in order to understand the future of the Chinese revolution and obtain correct revolutionary viewpoints; 2. Studying policies, that is, studying the Common Program and important policy documents of the Central Government and major administrative regions; 3. Rectification, that is, implementing criticism and self-criticism, in order to correct erroneous thoughts and erroneous behaviors that violate the interests of the state, the interests of the people, and the interests of the revolution.

(4) The content and method of study are divided into three categories according to the learners' level:

(A) Advanced. The subjects of study are tentatively set as basic theories of social science, issues of the Chinese revolution, and issues of current affairs and policies. The study methods are self-study, lectures, and group discussions.

(B) Intermediate. The subjects of study are tentatively set as general knowledge of the history of social development, general knowledge of Chinese issues, and general knowledge of current affairs and policies. The study methods are classes and group discussions. Those who are unwilling or unable to attend classes may also use self-study as a substitute.

(C) Elementary. The subjects of study are tentatively set as general knowledge of politics. The study methods are classes and group discussions.

(5) The rectification of people from all walks of life is in principle once a year, each time lasting one to two months. During the rectification period, regular study is suspended in order to concentrate on studying relevant documents and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. The content and method of rectification will be determined separately according to specific circumstances. Whether or not people participating in theoretical and policy study participate in rectification is also based on the principle of voluntariness. (Note: The 1952 rectification study is decided to focus on anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, see the CPPCC's January 5th notice.)

(6) In order to specifically lead the study of people from all walks of life, the CPPCC and the local consultative committees should establish study committees. For the convenience of work, the CPPCC's and local study committees may establish different sub-committees according to the different needs of various sectors (such as democratic parties sub-committees, industry and commerce sub-committees, etc.), and may establish offices under the study committees and sub-committees.

(7) The CPPCC's and local study committees should quickly organize theoretical study lectures and theoretical study night schools (or morning schools, weekend schools, etc.) separately or jointly with other parties, and begin to register study personnel and start grading and grouping. Those who have already participated in the study organizations of other parties do not need to participate in the study organizations led by the CPPCC and local consultative committees again.

(8) The CPPCC study committee may issue general instructions on study to the local study committees, but specific issues of local study shall be resolved by the local study committees.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference issued a notice on the 5th, calling on people from all walks of life across the country, especially the broad masses of people in industry and commerce, to carry out ideological remolding study on anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy. The full text is as follows:

In accordance with the instructions of the CPPCC on December 29, 1951, it is now decided that the current ideological remolding study of people from all walks of life across the country will focus on anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, in order to cooperate with actual struggles, eliminate the remnants of the old era, establish the morality of the new society, and lay the foundation for future regular study. The time for this study is set for two months. The study methods are studying documents, organizing reports, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism (including reporting and confession). The study documents are set as "Comrade Mao Zedong on Opposing Corruption and Waste," the People's Daily's January 4th editorial "In the Great Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy, Where Does the Key to Mobilizing the Masses Lie?" and the reports of the heads of major administrative regions and provinces and cities on anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy. The more people participating in the study, the better, especially efforts should be made to attract the broad masses of people in industry and commerce to participate. It is hoped that the consultative organs in various localities will quickly establish study committees to lead this great study movement.
