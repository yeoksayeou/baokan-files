    China Animal Products Company Purchasing Department Fur and Hide Section
    One Wrong Character Caused a Great Loss
    Editor: The staff of the China Animal Products Company Purchasing Department Fur and Hide Section have serious bureaucratic and careless work styles. When they notified the major administrative region companies and branches of the purchase price of ox tails, they made a mistake in one character, causing a serious loss of state assets. Mu Jingqiu, a typist in the Fur and Hide Section, was careless in her work and changed the character "斤" (jin, catty/pound) in "收购牛尾按斤计算" (purchase ox tails calculated by the catty/pound) to "个" (ge, individual/piece). Zhang Su and Cai Bizhu did not correct the error when proofreading the galleys and sent them to the Fur and Hide Section. The responsible comrade of the Fur and Hide Section did not proofread the printed notice again with a copy, and carelessly sent it to the major administrative region companies and branches. Now, in the Subei Yangzhou branch alone, more than 8 million yuan was lost in the purchase of ox tails. I believe that this serious bureaucracy and careless work style cannot be tolerated. I suggest that relevant departments conduct a quick inspection of this matter.

### 中国畜产公司收购处皮毛科  写错一个字造成很大损失

    中国畜产公司收购处皮毛科
    写错一个字造成很大损失
    编辑同志：中国畜产公司收购处皮毛科的工作人员有严重的官僚主义和粗枝大叶作风。他们向各大行政区公司、分公司通知收购牛尾的价格时，弄错了一个字，使国家资财遭受了严重损失。皮毛科的打字员穆静秋工作粗枝大叶，把“收购牛尾按斤计算”的“斤”字错成“个”字。张苏、蔡陛珠校对清样时，也没有把错误校对出来，就送到皮毛科。皮毛科的负责同志也没有把印好的通知再用副本校对一次，就轻率地向各大行政区公司、分公司发出。现在只苏北扬州分公司一处，在收购牛尾时就损失了八百多万元。我认为这种严重的官僚主义和粗枝大叶作风是不能容忍的，我建议有关部门对这件事速作检查。
