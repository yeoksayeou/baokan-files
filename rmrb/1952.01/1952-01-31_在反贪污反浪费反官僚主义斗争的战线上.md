On the Front Lines of the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy

    Nanjing Launches General Attack on Major Corrupt Elements

    The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Nanjing has entered the stage of launching a general attack on major corrupt elements. On the basis of widespread mobilization of the masses to launch confessions and denunciations, many major corrupt elements have begun to be exposed. On January 24th, the Nanjing Municipal Commission for Checking Savings issued an emergency notice, calling on all forces to be organized, all effective measures to be taken, to attack from both inside and outside, to encircle and suppress, and to pursue and track down, so that no major corrupt element could escape the net. The Municipal Commission for Checking Savings also announced: Corrupt elements are required to thoroughly and clearly confess all their corrupt acts before January 31st. Those who confess clearly on time will be treated as voluntary confessions and may be given leniency, mitigation, or exemption from punishment at the discretion of the court; otherwise, they will be severely punished according to law.

    奸商Zhang Yinfang Retaliates Against Shop Assistants; Wuhan People's Court Arrests Him and Brings Him to Justice

    Zhang Yinfang, the boss of Taihe Yongshan Native Products Store in Wuhan, retaliated against shop assistants who reported him, beating them twice. The People's Court of the city has arrested him and brought him to justice. The奸商Zhang Yinfang frequently evaded taxes, engaged in speculation and profiteering, and stole and sold oxhide purchased and sold by the people's government under a unified plan. On January 3rd, a young shop assistant, Tang Houyin, reported Zhang Yinfang's illegal tax evasion, and was immediately beaten by Zhang Yinfang. On January 22nd, Zhang Yinfang received a notice from the local tax bureau to pay a fine, and beat the shop assistant Tang Houyin again. On January 23rd, the Zhongnan Workers' Daily exposed Zhang Yinfang's criminal act of beating shop assistants twice, and the Earth Products Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Shop Employees' Union also lodged a serious protest, demanding that the people's government punish the奸商Zhang Yinfang. The People's Court of the city accepted the request of the Shop Employees' Union and immediately arrested the criminal Zhang. The people's government will impose severe legal sanctions on such lawbreakers who dare to retaliate against shop assistants who report them.

    Local Organizations of Various Democratic Parties in Guangzhou Actively Participate in the Struggle Against Corruption and Waste

    Local organizations of various democratic parties in Guangzhou are actively participating in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. The South China Provisional Working Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, the Southern General Branch of the China Democratic League, the Guangdong Provincial Working Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the South China General Branch of the China Zhi Gong Party, the Guangzhou Branch of the China National Democratic Construction Association, and the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy have all held mobilization meetings against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. At the mobilization meeting, the South China Provisional Working Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee announced the expulsion from the party of Chen Xize, who had repeatedly violated the law and engaged in corruption while working in the Guangzhou Municipal Real Estate Administration Bureau and refused to confess. After preliminary self-reflection within the association, members of the industrial and commercial circles of the Guangzhou Branch of the China National Democratic Construction Association have gone to more than seventy industries in the industrial and commercial circles, respectively, to prepare to take the lead in confessing. The South China General Branch of the China Zhi Gong Party convened a forum of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Guangzhou to mobilize them to participate in this struggle.

    More than 800 members of democratic parties and democratic figures held a joint conference on the 21st to launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

    Mass Art Creation is a Powerful Weapon to Promote the Anti-Corruption Movement

    In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the employees of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau created a large number of cartoons, propaganda posters, and serial cartoons. These paintings were created based on the government's policies and the ideological conditions of the masses in the unit, and therefore played a good role in promoting the development of the movement. At the beginning of the movement, they painted a healthy worker clearing away a pile of rubble and roots symbolizing corruption and waste on the road of industrialization in the new China, expressing the clear attitude of the working class towards corruption and waste. After the movement unfolded, because some leading cadres had bureaucracy and some employees had complacency, they drew cartoons based on this, which played a great educational role for those with bureaucracy and complacency. When the masses developed new complacency in the development of the movement, they created a picture of "Deepening the Movement" and wrote a clapper rhyme next to the picture to encourage everyone to make persistent efforts to pursue corrupt elements. The masses said after seeing the picture: "We must not be complacent and must plug the big loopholes and catch the big rats." In addition, they also created models of integrity, dedication, and hard work.

    In this movement, the mass art work of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau was very active and powerful. One hundred and twenty-four amateur art workers among the masses used collective creation methods to promptly cooperate with each battle in the entire campaign, creating more than 270 cartoons, propaganda posters, and serial cartoons. The experience of this art propaganda activity of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau is worthy of learning and promotion by many agencies, factories, and enterprises. As long as the power of the amateur art workers of the masses within the agency is fully utilized, and political and policy guidance and assistance are provided, they can become an important weapon for educating the masses and promoting the movement.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争的战线上
    南京市向大贪污犯发动总攻击
    南京市反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动已进入向大贪污犯发动总攻击的阶段。在普遍发动群众开展坦白检举的基础上，许多大贪污犯已开始被揭露出来。南京市节约检查委员会二十四日发出紧急通知，号召组织一切力量，采取一切有效办法，内外夹攻，重重包围，跟踪追击，不让一个大贪污犯漏网。市节约检查委员会并宣布：限定贪污分子在一月三十一日以前把自己的一切贪污行为彻底坦白交代清楚。按期交代清楚的都以自动坦白论处，可酌情从轻、减轻或免予处刑；否则一定依法严惩。

    武汉市泰和永山货行老板张荫芳，竟向检举他的店员进行报复，两次毒打店员，市人民法院已将其逮捕法办。奸商张荫芳经常偷税漏税，投机倒把，盗卖人民政府统购统销的牛皮。一月三日，青年店员唐厚荫检举了张荫芳偷税的不法行为，当即遭到张荫芳的毒打。二十二日，张荫芳接到本市税务局罚款的缴款通知书，又毒打店员唐厚荫一顿。二十三日，中南工人日报揭发了张荫芳两次毒打店员的犯罪行为，武汉市店员工会土产业委员会也提出了严重抗议，要人民政府给奸商张荫芳以制裁。市人民法院接受了店员工会的要求，当即逮捕张犯。对这种胆敢报复店员检举的不法分子，人民政府将给予严厉的法律制裁。
    广州市各民主党派地方组织纷纷参加反贪污反浪费斗争
    广州市各民主党派的地方组织纷纷参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。中国国民党革命委员会华南临时工作委员会、中国民主同盟南方总支部、中国农工民主党广东省工作委员会、中国致公党华南总支部、中国民主建国会广州市分会和中国民主促进会广州市分会筹备委员会都已分别召开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的动员会。中国国民党革命委员会华南临时工作委员会在动员会上，宣布将曾在广州市房地产管理局工作的一再违法贪污而又不肯坦白的陈锡泽开除党籍。中国民主建国会广州市分会工商界的会员，在会内进行了初步反省后，已分别到工商界的七十多个行业中去，准备带头坦白。中国致公党华南总支部召集在广州的归国华侨和侨眷举行座谈会，发动他们参加这个斗争。
    全市各民主党派成员和民主人士八百多人曾在二十一日联合举行大会，开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。
    群众美术创作是推进反贪污运动的有力武器
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，北京电信局的职工创作了大量的漫画、宣传画和连环画。这些画是根据政府的政策和本单位的群众思想情况创作的，因而对运动的开展起了很好的推进作用。在运动开始时他们画了一个健康的工人正在铲除新中国工业化前进道路上的一堆象征贪污、浪费的乱石和树根，表现出工人阶级对待贪污浪费的明确态度。运动展开后，因为部分领导干部有官僚主义，部分职工群众有麻痹思想，他们又据此画了漫画，对于有官僚主义和麻痹思想的人起了很大的教育作用。当运动发展中群众又产生了新的自满情绪的时候，他们又创作了一幅“把运动深入下去”的图画，并在图画旁边，写了一首快板，鼓励大家再接再厉，追击贪污分子。群众看了这画都说：“咱们千万别得意忘形，一定要堵塞大漏洞，捉住大耗子。”除此以外，他们还创作了表扬廉洁奉公，艰苦朴素的模范。
    在这次运动中，北京电信局的群众美术工作是十分活跃和有力的。一百二十四位群众中的业余美术工作者用集体创作的方式，及时地配合整个战役中每一个战斗，共创作了二百七十多幅漫画、宣传画和连环画。北京电信局的这一美术宣传活动的经验，值得许多机关工厂企业学习推广。只要充分利用机关内部群众的业余美术工作者的力量，加以政治方面和政策方面的指导和帮助，就可以使他们成为教育群众和推进运动的重要武器。
