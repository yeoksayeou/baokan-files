    [From Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Committee for the Practice of Economy Inspection, at the request of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, temporarily suspended inspections for three days from the 16th to the 18th, the fourth extension of the confession deadline, in order to give those industrialists and businessmen who had committed illegal acts such as bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property an opportunity to thoroughly confess if they were willing to repent and start anew. The deadline expired on the 19th, and a large-scale inspection was restarted. Nearly 3,000 people participated in this inspection, including staff from central and municipal-level agencies, organizations, democratic parties, university professors, university students, and cultural workers.
    Since the launch of the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles more than 20 days ago, the Municipal Committee for the Practice of Economy Inspection has repeatedly extended the confession deadline as many as four times. During the suspension of inspections from the 16th to the 18th, the Beijing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce focused on key industries and key households to conduct in-depth mobilization. There was a significant increase in confession and denunciation materials compared to before. On the last day alone, the Municipal Committee for the Practice of Economy Inspection received more than 15,000 pieces of confession and denunciation materials, in addition to the more than 50,000 pieces previously confessed and denounced. However, there are still many illegal industrialists and businessmen who remain obstinate and have not seized the opportunity to thoroughly confess. A small number even tried to deny and sabotage the movement in various ways. These incorrigible illegal industrialists and businessmen who harm the interests of the state and the people will receive due punishment in this major inspection.

    北京市节约检查委员会动员三千人
    重新对工商界进行大规模检查
    执迷不悟的不法商人将受到应有的惩处
    【本报讯】北京市节约检查委员会，应市工商联合会的请求，自十六日至十八日第四次展延坦白期限暂时停止检查三天，以便给予那些有行贿、偷税、盗骗国家资财等不法行为而愿意悔过自新的工商业者以彻底坦白的机会。十九日限期已满，重新开始进行大规模的检查。参加这次检查的有中央和市级各机关、团体、民主党派工作人员及大学教授、大学生、文化工作者近三千人。
    北京市工商界自从开展反贪污、反行贿运动二十多天来，市节约检查委员会已经一再展延坦白期限达四次之多。在十六日至十八日暂停检查期间，北京市工商业联合会抓紧重点行业、重点户进行深入动员，坦白检举的材料较前有显著增加，仅最后一天市节约检查委员会所收到的坦白检举材料即有一万五千余件。连以前坦白检举的材料五万余件。但是还有不少不法工商业者仍然执迷不悟，没有抓紧时机彻底坦白交代，一小部分甚至多方抵赖破坏运动。这些危害国家利益、危害人民利益的怙恶不悛的不法工商业者，将要在这次大检查中受到应有的惩处。
