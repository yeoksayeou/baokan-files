    Northeast Native Produce Company and Liaoxi Provincial Branch
    Negligently Inspect Product Specifications, Wasting Manpower and Resources, Affecting Exports
    Comrade Editor: On November 27th of last year, the Northeast Native Produce Company, through its affiliated Liaoxi Provincial Native Produce Company, transferred 1,309 boxes of egg white and egg yolk to Tianjin, entrusting the Northeast People's Government Trade Department's Beijing-Tianjin Joint Office to sell them on commission. The day after the goods arrived, they sent people to negotiate a deal with the Tianjin Animal Products Company. The Tianjin Animal Products Company decided to export this batch of goods. However, when inspecting the product specifications, the following was discovered: 1. The weight of the egg yolk and egg white was insufficient. 2. The markings on the boxes did not match the actual goods. 3. There were many errors in the stamps and tax stamps affixed to the boxes. 4. The stamps were altered without permission from the tax bureau.

    The Northeast Native Produce Company's work is careless and does not seriously inspect product specifications. This has not only caused a loss of more than 3.7 million yuan for this batch of goods, but more seriously, it has tied up funds and affected exports. I hope that relevant units will seriously investigate this matter, learn from the lessons, and avoid the recurrence of similar incidents. Xu Zhongjie

### 东北土产公司和辽西省分公司  不认真检查产品规格标准浪费人力物力影响了出口

    东北土产公司和辽西省分公司
    不认真检查产品规格标准浪费人力物力影响了出口
    编辑同志：去年十一月二十七日，东北区土产公司经由其所属辽西省土产公司，调到天津一千三百零九箱蛋白、蛋黄委托东北人民政府贸易部驻京津联合办事处代销，货到后第二天，就派人和天津市畜产公司洽商成交。天津市畜产公司决定把这批货出口。但检查产品规格时，发现：一、蛋黄、蛋白不够重量。二、箱皮标记和实货不符。三、箱上贴的印花和税花，有许多错误。四、没经税局允许，擅自涂改印花。
    东北土产公司工作中粗枝大叶，不认真检查产品规格标准，不但使这批货损失了三百七十多万元，更严重的是积压了资金，影响了出口。我希望有关单位认真检查这一件事情，记取教训，避免再发生类似事件。    徐忠杰
