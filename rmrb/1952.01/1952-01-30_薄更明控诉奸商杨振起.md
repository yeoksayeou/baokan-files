    Bo Gengming Accuses the Profiteer Yang Zhenqi

　　Editor: I was extremely pleased to see the news that the People's Government had arrested Yang Zhenqi, the manager of the Beijing Heyuantai Hardware Store. I now want to accuse him. Yang Zhenqi once enticed and forced me to use the name of the public to buy ten tons of iron plates for him and embezzle three iron pipes belonging to the public.

    Yang Zhenqi used despicable means such as flirting with waitresses, going to the theater, and dancing to seduce me; at first, I was vigilant and refused. However, because I had a bad gambling habit, he took advantage of me. Once, I lost money gambling, and he hypocritically "lent" me five million yuan; at the time, I didn't dare to accept it. He said, "Take it, many people from your place have borrowed money from me," "I see you as a good friend; if we don't meet here, we'll meet somewhere else; can you stay in the revolution forever?" When he saw me hesitating, he added, "If the central government doesn't want you, come find me, and I guarantee you'll have food to eat." He also gave me coats, trousers, etc. That's how I became his captive. Later, he forced me to buy five tons of iron plates for him under the name of the public. I was afraid he would turn against me, so I had to buy them for him (but the purchase didn't go through because the import company had no stock). In addition, he also embezzled three public white iron pipes, gaining about 1.2 million yuan (according to him), and giving me 300,000 yuan. Last year, I had already confessed these issues to the organization. When the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement started this time, he sent Yu Jintang, one of their "outside runners," to find me, wanting to form an "alliance of mutual defense" with me. Although I criticized him at the time and told him to quickly confess to the government and turn over a new leaf, he told others that those things didn't happen, which shows how cunning and treacherous he is. I request the People's Government to severely punish Yang Zhenqi according to the law.

    薄更明控诉奸商杨振起
  　编辑同志：我看到人民政府逮捕了北京和远泰五金行经理杨振起的消息，觉得万分愉快。我现在要控诉他。杨振起曾引诱我和强迫我拿公家的名义，代他买十吨铁板和盗卖公家三根铁管。
    杨振起曾用调戏女招待、看戏、跳舞等卑鄙手段来诱惑我；最初我都警惕着并且拒绝了。但因我有赌博的坏习惯，便被他钻了空子。有一次我“打牌”输了钱，他假仁假义地“借”给我五十万元；当时我不敢要。他说：“拿住吧，你们那里有许多人借过我的钱”，“我看你够朋友，咱们这不见，那见，你还能干一辈子革命吗？”当他看到我一再犹豫时，他又说：“中直不要你时，你来找我，我保险你有饭吃。”他又送了大衣、裤子等给我。我就这样变成了他的俘虏。后来，他曾经逼迫我用公家名义代他买五吨铁板。我怕他翻脸，只得去替他买（后因进口公司无货而没有买成）。另外，他还盗卖了公家的白铁管三根，得款一百二十万元左右（据他说），分给我三十万元。去年我已经向组织上交代了这些问题。这次反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动开始时，他派他们一个“跑外”的伙计于金堂来找我，想和我订立“攻守同盟”。虽然，我当时批评了他一顿，并告诉他赶快向政府坦白，痛改前非，但他又和别人说没有那些事，由此可见他是如何狡猾奸诈了。我要求人民政府依法给杨振起以严厉的惩罚。
