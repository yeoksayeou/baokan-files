    The Ministry of Communications Should Not Use Huge Sums of Money to Build Artificial Mountains and Pavilions
    To the Editor: Chairman Mao has called on us to increase production and practice strict economy. However, the Central Ministry of Communications is building an unnecessary artificial mountain and pavilion. This project will cost more than 16 million RMB to complete. We believe that this is contrary to Chairman Mao's call. We have raised objections and suggested stopping this project successively, but have not received a response. Now I want to expose this matter in the newspaper. I hope the relevant responsible comrades will handle it quickly.

    Editor's Note: According to a letter from the General Office of the Central Ministry of Communications, they have already conducted an investigation into this matter and have reviewed this wasteful phenomenon during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

    交通部不应该用巨款修建假山和亭子
    编辑同志：毛主席号召我们增加生产，厉行节约。但是，中央交通部却正在修建一座不必需的假山和亭子。这项工程要费一千六百多万元人民币才能完工。我们认为，这是和毛主席的号召相违背的。我们曾经先后提出意见，建议停止这项工程，但都没有得到答复。现在我要在报纸上揭发这件事情。我希望有关负责同志迅速处理。

    编者按：据中央交通部办公厅来信说，他们已经对这件事作了检查；并在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，对这种浪费现象作了检讨。
