Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 23rd: This reporter reports: When the US side could not find an excuse to delay reaching an agreement on the third item on the agenda, it resorted to despicable means of conducting air raids and creating incidents to continue obstructing the agreement. With the emergence of this situation, the Panmunjom armistice negotiations have undergone a dangerous shift. Now the US representatives are not even willing to pretend to conceal their delaying tactics. On the 20th, after a five-minute meeting of the Third Item Agenda Subcommittee, US representative Ferrenbo proposed adjournment. He read a pre-prepared five-sentence statement, reiterating his unwillingness to remove the final obstacle hindering the agreement—the demand to restrict airport facilities—and then arrogantly slammed his folder shut.

General Xie Fang's response to him was firm and unwavering. He said: "Our side will never accept any plan or intention to interfere in internal affairs." The obstacles set up by the US representative should be removed by themselves.

The US spokesperson deliberately concealed the recent developments in the armistice negotiations, fabricating news that "the atmosphere of the meeting was harmonious" and that the negotiations were not endangered by the US side's perfidious behavior in undermining the agreement. In fact, the US representatives have turned the armistice conference into a place for haggling and farcical debates. When an agreement is within reach, they try every means to find excuses to delay the negotiations. However, the sophistry they engage in is so absurd that they slap themselves in the face and fall into an extremely chaotic and embarrassing situation. The following quoted statement is one example.

In order to defend their unreasonable demands, US representative Tenner shouted in the conference tent: "We are almost completely interfering in your internal affairs. When the armistice agreement is signed, ninety-nine percent of this interference will be lifted. This is a big concession on our part." But another US representative, Ferrenbo, said: "We do not insist on interfering in your internal affairs. Restricting sovereignty is not interfering in internal affairs." Tenner said: "You can't stop us from interfering in your internal affairs." But Ferrenbo said: "Under the circumstances of freely accepting restrictions on sovereignty, it is not considered interference in internal affairs."

However, the US representatives agree on one thing, that is, they delay every day, so that the armistice negotiations cannot finally reach an agreement after long discussions.

During this period, one excuse after another of the US side has been removed, and all the basic conditions needed to reach a stable armistice have been agreed upon. The main excuse for the US representatives to delay the agreement is the so-called problem that the construction of airports will increase air force strength. Long ago, the Korean and Chinese representatives clearly suggested that in order to ensure the stability of the military armistice, no reinforcing combat aircraft should enter from outside Korea. This suggestion has removed the US side's excuse. If the principle agreed upon by both sides, that no reinforcing combat aircraft should enter, is strictly enforced, it is unimaginable to increase air force strength. Then the US representatives hurriedly came up with another excuse. This time it was said that combat aircraft could fly into Korea in a few minutes. But even Ferrenbo had to admit that this excuse was not clever. Because this statement implies "any party has the intention to violate the armistice agreement," he had to "apologize for causing this misunderstanding."

Now, the US representatives don't even bother to make excuses. Tenner has not been to the meeting for more than a week, letting Ferrenbo repeat every day: "We will continue to persist." What does such persistence mean? The answer to this question can be found in their recent series of provocative actions—violating Chinese airspace, bombing prisoner-of-war camps in northern Korea, bombing the Kaesong neutral zone, and then bombing and strafing the vehicles of the Korean and Chinese delegations.

These destructive activities were instigated behind the scenes by US Eighth Army Commander Van Fleet; these destructive activities have serious implications precisely when the agreement on the third item on the agenda is already in sight. Van Fleet called the Korean War a "godsend," and he told US reporters on the 20th: "Fortunately, there is the Korean War, so that our defenses (?) look very good. Our factories can now produce more and more weapons." That is to say: Wall Street gets more profits.

Now, the American people and the soldiers on the front lines can more clearly understand why Joye wants more "patience" and "time" to maintain the state of war in Korea.

### 新华社记者报道  美方穷凶极恶地制造事件拖延谈判

    美方穷凶极恶地制造事件拖延谈判
    【新华社开城二十三日电】本社记者报道：美方在找不到藉口来拖延第三项议程达成协议时，就穷凶极恶地采取了进行空袭和制造事件以继续阻挠协议的卑劣手段。随着这种情况的出现，板门店停战谈判发生了危险的转变。现在美方代表连粉饰他们的拖延战术的工夫也不肯做了。二十日，第三项议程小组委员会开了五分钟会以后，美方代表费伦波就提议休会。他宣读了预先拟就的只有五句话的发言稿，重申他不愿消除妨碍协议的最后一个障碍——限制机场设备的要求，随后就傲慢地砰的一声关上他的文件夹子。
    解方将军给他的答复是坚决而不可动摇的。他说：“我方决不接受任何干涉内政的方案或意图。”美方代表布下的障碍，应由他们自己除去。
    美方发言人故意掩饰最近停战谈判的发展，捏造消息说“会议空气和谐”，谈判没有因美方破坏协议的背信弃义行为而受到危险。事实上，美方代表已把停战会议变成了进行讨价还价和滑稽的辩论的场所。在协议伸手可及的时候，他们千方百计寻找藉口，以拖延谈判。但是，由于他们所进行的诡辩是如此荒诞，就使得他们自打耳光，陷于极端混乱的狼狈境地。下面引述的发言就是一个例子。
    美方代表滕纳为了替他们的无理要求辩护，曾在会议帐篷中叫嚣：“我们几乎在完全干涉你们的内政。当停战协议签字时，这种干涉的百分之九十九就会解除。这是我们的大让步。”但是，另一个美方代表费伦波却说：“我们不坚持要干涉你们的内政。限制主权并不是干涉内政。”滕纳说：“你不能阻止我们干涉你们的内政。”但是费伦波说：“在自由接受主权的限制的情况下，不算是干涉内政。”
    然而，美方的代表们在一件事上却是意见一致的，那就是他们每天拖延，使停战谈判经过长期的讨论而仍不能最后达成协议。
    在这一个时期内，美方的一个接一个的藉口都已被解除，为达成一个稳定的停战所需要的一切基本条件也已取得协议。美方代表拖延协议的主要藉口是所谓修建机场将增加空军力量的问题。很久以前，朝中代表曾经明确地建议：为保证军事停战的稳定，不得从朝鲜境外进入增援的作战飞机，这个建议已经把美方的藉口解除了。如果严格执行双方已经商定的、不得进入增援的作战飞机的原则的话，增加空军力量是不可想像的。于是美方代表连忙想出另外一个藉口。这次是说：作战飞机能在几分钟之内飞入朝鲜。但是连费伦波也不得不承认，这个藉口太不高明。因为这种说法暗示“任何一方有违反停战协定的意图”，他只好对使人发生“这种误解表示歉意”。
    现在，美方代表甚至不费心思去制造藉口了。滕纳已经有一个多星期不来开会，让费伦波每天重复地说：“我们将继续坚持下去。”这样的坚持意味着什么呢？在他们最近的一系列的挑衅行动中——侵犯中国领空、轰炸朝鲜北部的战俘营、轰炸开城中立区、随后又轰炸和扫射朝中代表团的车辆——可以找到这个问题的回答。
    美国第八军军长范佛里特曾在幕后策动这些破坏性的活动；恰恰正当第三项议程的协议已经在望的时候，这种破坏性的活动具有严重的意义。范佛里特称朝鲜战争为“天赐鸿福”，他在二十日告美方记者说：“幸而有朝鲜战争，才使得我们的防务（？）很像个样子。我们的工厂目前又能生产更多更多的武器了。”这就是说：华尔街获得了更多的利润。
    现在，美国的人民和前线上的士兵都能更清楚地知道，为什么乔埃希望要有更多的“忍耐”与“时间”，以维持朝鲜的战争状态了。
