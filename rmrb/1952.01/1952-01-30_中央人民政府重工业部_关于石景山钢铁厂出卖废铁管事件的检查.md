    Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government
    Inspection of the Shihchingshan Iron and Steel Plant's Sale of Scrap Iron Pipes Incident

    To the Editor: On November 26, 1951, the People's Daily published on its second page the news item "Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central Government Sells Good Iron Pipes as Scrap Iron to Private Merchants." The Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government specially dispatched Luo Jun to Shihchingshan Iron and Steel Plant to conduct an inspection together with Lin Chengzhu and Wu Eryao of the People's Supervisory Committee of the Government Administration Council, and invited relevant units to study the issue. The results of the inspection are written below:

    There were 800 tons of pig iron pipes, of varying shapes and specifications, all transported from Japan and Northeast China between 1943 and 1944. These pipes had been stored for seven or eight years without being used extensively.

    In June 1951, the steel plant implemented an economic accounting system. When clearing assets and determining capital, the leadership believed that these pipes were tying up funds and decided to hand them over. At this time, the Tianjin Machinery Casting Industry Association and the Wuxi Foundry Industry First Joint Group wanted to buy these pipes, offering 1.8 million yuan per ton. The Steel Industry Bureau agreed to sell 500 tons to Tianjin and 300 tons to Wuxi. Because the pipes were large and bulky, making transportation inconvenient, the buyers requested that they be smashed. The Steel Industry Bureau, in order to quickly resolve the problem of tied-up funds, urged the steel plant to smash them. Based on the inspection results, the Ministry of Heavy Industry believes that these pipes could be smashed and sold because such pipes would not have suitable uses for several years and could also be manufactured domestically. Selling these iron pipes would be beneficial to accelerating capital turnover.

    The shortcomings of the Steel Industry Bureau in handling these pipes were: insufficient and careful inspection, smashing and selling a small portion of pipe fittings that could have been used in the plant as scrap iron, which was a loss to the country; not conducting sufficient research and assessment of market conditions, resulting in a lower price; and failing to understand the workers' sentiments or providing them with patient explanations before handling the matter, affecting their morale. These are lessons that should be heeded in the future.

### 中央人民政府重工业部  关于石景山钢铁厂出卖废铁管事件的检查

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央人民政府重工业部
    关于石景山钢铁厂出卖废铁管事件的检查
    编辑同志：一九五一年十一月二十六日，人民日报第二版发表了“中央重工业部把好铁管当作废铁卖给私商”的消息。中央重工业部特派罗军协同政务院人民监察委员会林承祖、吴尔尧赴石景山钢铁厂检查，并邀请有关单位研究这个问题。现把检查结果写在下面：
    这批生铁管子共有八百吨，形状规格参差不齐，全是一九四三年到一九四四年间从日本和东北运来的。这些管子放了七、八年之久，从来没有大量使用。
    一九五一年六月，钢铁厂推行经济核算制。在清理资产核定资金时，领导方面认为这些管子积压了资金，决定上交。这时天津市机器铸铁业公会和无锡翻沙业第一联营组要买这些管子，出价每吨一百八十万元。钢铁工业局答应把这些管子卖给天津五百吨，无锡三百吨。因为管子大而笨重，搬运不便，买主要求砸碎。钢铁工业局为了急速解决资金积压的问题，便督促钢铁厂把它砸碎。根据检查结果，重工业部认为这些管子可以砸碎出卖，因为像这样的管子，在几年内没有适当用处，而且在国内来说，也可以制造。出卖了这批铁管，对加速资金周转则有好处。
    钢铁工业局处理这批管子的缺点是：检查不够认真仔细，把其中一小部分能在厂里用的管件砸碎当废铁出卖，这对国家是一种损失，没有很好地研究和估计市场的情况，作价较低；处理之前，没有了解工人情绪，没有对工人进行耐心地解释，影响了工人情绪。这些教训，今后值得引起注意。
