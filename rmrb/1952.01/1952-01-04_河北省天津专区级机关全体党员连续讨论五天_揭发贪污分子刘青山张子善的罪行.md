    Hebei Province Tianjin Special District Level Organs All Party Members Discussed for Five Consecutive Days
    Exposing the Crimes of Corrupt Elements Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan
    After listening to Comrade Xue Xun, Minister of the Organization Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, on December 17th last year, regarding the crimes of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan in the major corruption case and the "Resolution of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on Expelling Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Party," all Communist Party members of various organs at the Tianjin Special District level in Hebei Province used the time in the morning and evening for three consecutive days for group discussions. In order to effectively lead this movement and deeply mobilize Party members to carry out the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, everyone also democratically elected a general committee for the economy drive and five subordinate branches. In this way, the backbone elements among the Party members participated in the leadership organs of this movement. On December 20th, the general meeting for discussion began. The general meeting discussion lasted for five days. According to the decision of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, starting from the 25th, the organs at the special district level entered the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, based on the ideological foundation of the general meeting discussion, with each organ as a unit.
    In this general meeting discussion, all Party members unanimously expressed: wholeheartedly supporting the resolution of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on expelling Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Party, and raising themselves a step further in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. This general meeting discussion was a general exposure and criticism by all Party members at the Tianjin Special District level of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan's crimes of betraying the Party and the people.
    In the five days of general meeting discussion, a total of fifty-one people spoke, including representatives from twenty units and thirty-one people expressing individual opinions. Every comrade's speech was exhaustive. This atmosphere of intra-Party democracy broke the dictatorial, autocratic, and feudal ruling order created by the traitors Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan within the Party, allowing all Party members to breathe fresh air.
    The general meeting discussion focused on opposing the evil deeds of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan. Every comrade's speech expressed extreme anger at Liu and Zhang's deduction of grain for river management laborers. They denounced their crime of embezzling the government loan granted to the disaster victims of 107 flood-stricken villages in Huangzhuangwa, Baodi County, for fish farming on behalf of the people of Huangzhuangwa. Regarding their destruction of national construction institutions, high-salary bribery of technical personnel from state-owned construction companies; embezzlement of educational grain, causing the collapse of 1,014 primary schools and the unemployment of 1,896 primary school teachers; collusion with private merchants and theft of tinplate; and the use of land compensation grain for the airport construction, falsely claiming construction projects to fraudulently obtain bank loans of 6 billion yuan, comrades unanimously pointed out that this had seriously damaged the Party's prestige among the masses and undermined the laws and disciplines of the people's government, thus causing immeasurable losses to the Party and the people's government.
    During the general meeting discussion, comrades not only clearly recognized that Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan were criminals who betrayed the Party and the people, but also recognized that these two traitors were also political careerists. Zhang Zishan said: "The production of organs in the special district will be combined with the production of organs in various counties in the future to form a 'parent-subsidiary' system." At last year's "July 1st" celebration, someone even shouted the slogan "Salute the wise leader Commissioner Zhang." Zhang Zishan not only did not criticize and prohibit this shameless person, but praised him instead. Liu Qingshan said shamelessly about suppressing intra-Party democracy and establishing his own feudal ruling order: "This is the concretization of Marxism-Leninism in the Tianjin region!" Therefore, the so-called "Liu Qingshan Thought" appeared in the Tianjin Special District. From this, it can be seen that Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan already disregarded everything.
    Several comrades who had been suppressed and attacked by Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan also spoke at the meeting. Wang Zhan’ying wrote a letter accusing Zhang Zishan of squandering waste and suppressing intra-Party democracy, which Zhang Zishan suppressed for more than two months. During this period, Zhang Zishan talked to Wang Zhan’ying four times, using threats and inducements; but Wang Zhan’ying was not intimidated and strongly demanded that he forward the accusation letter to the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. His speech gave a good education to comrades who had committed serious liberalism. Huang Zhong was tortured by Zhang Zishan and got sick. He also spoke while ill. Huang Zhong used his personal experience of being attacked and framed to deeply expose the evil nature of Zhang Zishan. In addition, Deng Ping, Li Kecai, and others were dissatisfied with Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan because they insisted on correct struggle, and were repeatedly attacked and ridiculed by Liu and Zhang. They also made speeches. The comrades attending the meeting often applauded their resolute fighting spirit.
    The bureaucratic work style of the leadership was one of the main reasons for the development of this incident. Comrades strictly criticized this point in their speeches. Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan consistently wrote false reports to their superiors, exaggerated their achievements, and their superiors were unaware. The crimes of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan had developed to such a serious extent, and their superiors were still unaware. This allowed them to act recklessly within the Party and not be corrected for a long time.
    On the fifth day of the meeting, Comrade Xue Xun summarized the general meeting discussion of the past few days. She first pointed out: In the general meeting discussion of the past few days, we have launched a merciless struggle against corrupt and degenerate ideas and liberalism in exposing the crimes of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, and exposed and criticized bureaucracy. This has given the comrades participating in the meeting a profound ideological education and training, greatly improving our ideological awareness and initially clarifying the ideological boundaries. In this way, we have established a good start for the democratic life within the Party in the Tianjin Special District and laid a good foundation for the upcoming movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the organs at the special district level. She asked all comrades to bring the serious and conscientious attitude and highly principled fighting spirit of this struggle against the crimes of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan to the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the organs.
    The struggle against Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan's betrayal of the Party and the people, conducted by the Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China within the Party organizations at the special district level, has come to a temporary end. This struggle will be closely integrated with the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in various organs and will continue to deepen.

### 河北省天津专区级机关全体党员连续讨论五天  揭发贪污分子刘青山张子善的罪行

    河北省天津专区级机关全体党员连续讨论五天
    揭发贪污分子刘青山张子善的罪行
    河北省天津专区级各机关的全体共产党员，在去年十二月十七日听了中共河北省委组织部部长薛迅同志关于刘青山、张子善大贪污案的罪行和“中国共产党河北省委员会关于开除刘青山、张子善党籍的决议”的报告以后，利用早上和晚上的两个时间连续进行了三天小组讨论。为了有力地领导这个运动，深入发动党员开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争，大家还民主选出了节约检查委员会总会及下属的五个分会，这样，党员中的骨干分子就参加了这个运动的领导机关。到十二月二十日，大会讨论开始。大会讨论一直持续了五天。根据中共天津地委的决定，从二十五日起，专区级各机关就在大会讨论的思想基础上，以机关为单位进入了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。
    在这次大会讨论中，全体党员一致表示：衷心拥护中共河北省委关于开除刘青山、张子善党籍的决议，并在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中把自己提高一步。这次大会讨论，就是天津专区级全体党员对刘青山、张子善背叛党、背叛人民的罪行的总揭发和批判。
    在五天的大会讨论中，共有五十一人发言，内有二十个单位的代表发言，三十一人发表个人意见。每个同志的发言，都是知无不言言无不尽。这种党内民主的气氛，打破了叛徒刘青山、张子善在党内造成的独裁、专制、封建统治秩序，使全体党员呼吸到了新鲜空气。
    大会讨论集中在反对刘青山、张子善的罪恶行为。每一个同志的发言，都对刘、张克扣治河民工粮表示了极大的愤怒。对他们盗用人民政府贷给宝坻县黄庄洼一百零七个水灾村灾民的治鱼贷款的罪行，代表黄庄洼人民进行了控诉。对于他们破坏国家建设机构、高薪收买国营建筑公司的技术人员；盗用教育粮，使一千零十四处小学垮了台，使一千八百九十六名小学教员失业；勾结私商，盗卖马口铁；动用飞机场占地补损粮，假借修建名义，骗取银行贷款六十亿元的罪恶行为，同志们一致指出已严重地破坏了党在群众中的威信，破坏了人民政府的法纪，因此给党和人民政府造成的损失是无法计量的。
    在大会讨论中，同志们不但清楚地认识了刘青山、张子善是叛党、叛人民的罪人，而且还认识了这两个叛徒还是政治野心家。张子善说：“专区的机关生产，将来要和各县的机关生产联合起来，成立‘母子公司’的系统。”在去年纪念“七一”的大会上，有人竟高喊“向英明的领袖张专员致敬”的口号，张子善不但不加批评和禁止，反倒表扬这个无耻之徒。刘青山对压制党内民主，建立自己的封建统治秩序，曾这样无耻地说：“我这是马克思、列宁主义在天津地区的具体化！”因此，在天津专区出现了所谓“刘青山思想”。由此可以知道，刘青山、张子善的眼里，已经目空一切。
    曾受到过刘青山、张子善压制和打击的几个同志也在会议上作了发言。王占瀛曾写了控告张子善挥霍浪费和压制党内民主的信，张子善一直压了两个多月。在这段时间里，张子善和王占瀛谈话四次，施以威胁利诱；但王占瀛一直没有被吓倒，强硬地要他把控诉书转给中共河北省委。他的发言，给了犯有严重自由主义的同志以很好的教育。黄忠被张子善折磨得得了病，他带着病也发言了。黄忠用亲身受打击、被陷害的经过，深刻地揭发了张子善的罪恶本质。另外邓平、李克才等都因为坚持正确的斗争，引起了刘青山、张子善的不满，一再受到刘、张的打击、讽刺，他们也作了发言。参加会议的同志，时常为他们的坚决斗争精神鼓掌。
    领导方面的官僚主义作风，是这个事件得以发展的主要原因之一。同志们在发言中都严格地批评了这一点。刘青山、张子善一贯向上级写假报告，好大喜功，上级也不知道。刘青山、张子善的罪行，已经发展到如此严重，上级还不了解。这就使他们能够在党内胡作非为，而在很长时间内得不到纠正。
    会议的第五天，由薛迅同志就几天来的大会讨论作总结。她首先指出：几天来的大会讨论，我们在揭发刘青山、张子善的罪行中，向贪污蜕化思想和自由主义开展了无情的斗争，揭发并批评了官僚主义，这就使参加会议的同志得到了一个深刻的思想教育和锻炼，使我们的思想觉悟大大地提高了一步，初步地划清了思想界限。这样，就使天津专区党内的民主生活，树立了良好的开端，为即将开始的专区级机关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，打下了良好的基础。她要求全体同志，要把这次向刘青山、张子善罪行作斗争的严肃认真的态度和高度原则性的斗争精神，带到机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中去。
    中共天津地委在专区级党的组织内进行的反刘青山、张子善叛党、叛人民的斗争，至此暂告一段落。这个斗争将和各机关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争紧密结合起来，继续深入下去。
