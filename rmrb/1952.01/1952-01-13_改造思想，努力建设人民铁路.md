    Remold Ideology, Strive to Build a People's Railway
    Wang Juqian, Deputy Director of the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government
    I am one of the railway construction workers, and I am an intellectual who needs ideological remolding. I was born into a petty-bourgeois family and believed in Christianity. My father was a primary school teacher. Due to family financial difficulties, I studied and worked part-time at a church school when I was young. In middle school, I entered a national school and chose railway engineering. Because my grades were not bad, I obtained a "government-funded" scholarship to study in the United States. After returning to China, I worked in the railway construction system for more than twenty years. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, I braved enemy air raids to repair railways. In the later period, I moved to the interior to build new roads, always sticking to my post. I thought I loved the motherland and was loyal to my duties. Therefore, in the early days of liberation, I thought that people like me had just not participated in the revolution. For the country and society, at least in terms of construction, I could be considered to have done my best. After more than two years of study, my political level is of course still very low, but the more I study, the more frightened I become, and the more I feel the need to remold myself. Based on my personal experience in work, the primary task of ideological remolding is to establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly.

    (I) Establish the Idea of Serving the People Wholeheartedly
    In the past, when I participated in railway construction work, in addition to the views of "personal interest" and "personal career," I cannot say that I did not have the idea of serving the country. But if I examine my past thoughts and actions according to the standard of serving the people wholeheartedly, I find many mistakes. I was concerned about state affairs during my student days. I participated in the anti-imperialist struggles during the May Fourth Movement and the May 30th Massacre. I went on strike, marched, gave speeches, and even took risks and was beaten with gun butts, but these were all just temporary outbursts of indignation. I did not recognize that this was part of the liberation movement. After the student movement was over, I still thought: "It's better to study hard and finish my studies before coming out to save the country." I visited various European countries when I returned home after studying in the United States for three years. At that time, on the one hand, I admired Western "material civilization," and on the other hand, because I had suffered the pain of being discriminated against as a weak country, I hated imperialist aggression and was indeed determined to save the country. But I took the wrong path to save the country. I was fascinated by reformist arguments such as "saving the country through education" and "saving the country through construction." The "September 18th Incident" began to disappoint me with the Kuomintang government. When the Anti-Japanese War broke out and the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cooperated, I was once again excited, thinking that the opportunity for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation had arrived. Later, the Kuomintang reactionaries used the Anti-Japanese War as a cover to engage in anti-communist and anti-people activities. This made me feel pessimistic and disappointed. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionaries, disregarding the peaceful wishes of the people of the whole country, launched a full-scale offensive against the people's liberation areas. On the one hand, I hated the Kuomintang government's corruption and incompetence, and on the other hand, I regarded it as China's "orthodoxy" and hoped that it could improve. Looking back now, this is simply ignorant. It was not until after liberation, after studying, that I began to understand the true meaning of the revolution and realize that the Chinese people could only turn over and stand up by uniting under the banner of the Communist Party and overthrowing the rule of internal and external reactionaries. Although I had some thoughts of "serving the country" in the past, I did not understand the essence of the old "country," let alone the people's position. In fact, it was a kind of reformist thinking, which objectively became an accomplice to the reactionaries' rule over the Chinese people. In the future, I must discard the baggage of reformist thinking, thoroughly transform myself, resolutely and wholeheartedly serve the people, and do a good job in the construction of our people's railway.

    (II) Eliminate Bureaucratism and Conservative Thinking
    The history of railway construction in China is already eighty-two years old. In the early days, it was handled by imperialists. Although it was self-managed later, it did not have the ability to be independent and autonomous in terms of the source of funds, the formulation of technical standards, and the use of building materials. It relied on the whims of imperialism everywhere and was just a set of semi-colonial methods. From surveying and design, supervision, construction, and even traffic operation management, the same organization took care of everything. There was no meticulous and precise design, only a rough drawing was made. Without direct construction, a rough estimate of the price was given and contracted to private merchants to start construction. When problems were encountered, temporary solutions were sought, and things were done as they came, without any overall plan. Sometimes orders were given to open to traffic within a limited time, and sometimes orders were given to stop work immediately. When materials were needed, they were not supplied in time. When funds were needed, they were not available in time. When rushing work, it was done poorly, and when work was stopped, it was left unattended. This blind phenomenon wasted a lot of manpower, financial resources, and materials. Therefore, past experience contains serious components of bureaucratism and conservative thinking.

    After liberation, the old system of taking care of everything was still used. Without careful plans and designs, tasks were "rushed" with enthusiasm. In terms of construction, private contractors were still partially relied upon, and the self-managed projects still adopted the labor system. Later, after learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we realized that we must design first and then construct, and proceed according to the construction procedures. Surveying and design, supervision, construction, and traffic operation must be separated from each other in terms of organizational structure. Otherwise, the shortcomings existing in all stages cannot be discovered and corrected. If production cannot be specifically responsible, it will hinder the progress of the entire railway construction work. In terms of construction, we cannot stay at the labor system and must adopt enterprise-based management.

    In October 1951, the Ministry of Railways convened a national railway engineering conference. In his summary report, Minister Teng Daiyuan determined that our construction policy for new lines in 1952 was: to carry out design work, to organize construction, and to implement the principle of designing first and then constructing. For organizational structure, it was decided to start with the internal division of labor of the organization that took care of everything, and to separate surveying and design, supervision, construction, and business management. In terms of design, we must follow the three steps of preliminary design, technical design, and detailed construction drawings, and write complete technical design documents within the prescribed time limit. In terms of construction, it was decided to prepare the conditions for enterprise-based management in the first half of 1952, and to try out enterprise-based management in the second half of the year. It was also decided that we must do a good job of preparation in 1952 to welcome larger-scale railway construction. However, because we were born into the petty bourgeoisie, we still have serious conservative thinking and liberalism. In the past, we were accustomed to designing and compiling budgets ourselves, contracting and inspecting ourselves, constructing ourselves, and using and operating ourselves, so we emphasized the difficulties of reform. Coupled with bureaucratic practices, the organization has not been separated until today. Since the construction department has not been able to be independent, it has hindered it from moving towards enterprise-based management.

    Construction technology is also full of conservative views. For example, the work of dragging the steel beams of the Liujiang Bridge was not completely carried out according to the suggestions of Soviet experts (mainly the method of pulling the beam rollers), which caused a lot of waste. Learning from this experience, the pulling beam work of the Tuojiang Bridge corrected this point, and the pulling speed was 7.5 times faster, proving how conservative thinking hindered the progress of the work in the past. However, due to the bureaucratic style, being careless and not properly summarizing other experiences of the Liujiang Bridge, we made many mistakes again when strengthening steel beams, connecting frames, supporting beams, winding steel cables, and making the slideway a downhill road, wasting national materials. During the bridge construction period, the workers once suggested that the slideway should be made a downhill road and that the supporting beam was too weak and might not be able to hold, but we did not adopt it, which also shows that our view of relying on the working class is not clear enough. Other advanced working methods such as soil compaction and tamping, the single-person eye punch created by labor models, and the method of excavating stone with "bamboo cannons" have long been widely promoted in the railway construction in the Southwest, but have only recently been promoted to the railway construction in the Northwest, which also shows the existence of bureaucratism and conservative thinking.

    Because there are no detailed and correct records of labor productivity, especially no correct and reasonable advanced technical quotas, we are bound by those old experience quotas and lag far behind the actual productivity of workers. For example, the past experience quota for manual excavation of hard rock pilot tunnels, including a transportation distance of 50 meters, in the Northwest was 20 workdays per cubic meter. The budget for the 19th tunnel of the Tianlan Line was calculated at 10 workdays, but the actual measurement only required 5.6 workdays. The budget for the excavation of soil pilot tunnels at the Dayingliang Tunnel was calculated at 4.28 workdays per cubic meter, but the actual measurement only required 1.1 workdays. For the manual pouring of 1:3:6 concrete for a small bridge at 4 kilometers of the Tianlan Line, including a transportation distance of 20 meters, the budget was calculated at 2.2 workdays per cubic meter, but the actual measurement only required 0.81 workdays. However, conservative thinking prevented us from boldly raising the technical quota, so that each budget was compiled very large, seriously accumulating the state's working capital and causing a lot of waste. In addition, technical quotas have a more active meaning. They are the basis for implementing economic accounting and piece-rate wages, which are necessary conditions for construction to move towards enterprise management. Therefore, we must vigorously promote universal measurement. However, some cadres hold a simple task view and do not pay attention to measurement work. For example, the Northwest Railway Bureau's work rate inspection team originally had several engineers. After a period of work, they were transferred, weakening the measurement force, which hindered the construction from moving towards enterprise-based management.

    Our railway construction work must absorb the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and apply it according to our actual situation in order to seek better development, and should not follow the old system in the past and be satisfied with our own narrow experience. We must discard the baggage of reformist thinking and carry out democratic reforms with revolutionary thinking. We must thoroughly eliminate bureaucratism and conservative thinking, and humbly start learning again in order to put railway construction on the right track.

    改造思想，努力建设人民铁路
    中央人民政府铁道部工程总局副局长  汪菊潜
    我是铁路建设工作人员之一，我是需要进行思想改造的知识分子。我出身于小资产阶级并信奉基督教的家庭，父亲是小学教员。由于家庭经济困难，小时候在教会学校半工半读。中学时进入国立学校，选读了铁路工程，因为成绩不坏，乃得“官费”留学美国。回国以后，一直在铁路建设系统工作了二十多年。抗日战争初期，曾冒着敌机空袭，抢修铁路，后期转移内地兴筑新路，始终坚守岗位。自以为热爱祖国，忠于职守。所以解放初期还以为像我这样的人，只是没有参加革命而已，对于国家、社会，至少是在建设方面，可算是尽了我的心力。经过两年多来的学习，政治水平当然还是很低，然而越学习就越惶恐，越感觉到自己有改造的必要。就我个人在工作中的体会，改造思想的首要一环是树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。
    （一）树立全心全意为人民服务的思想
    我过去参加铁路建设工作，除了“个人兴趣”“个人事业”观点等外，不能说没有为国家服务的思想。但如果根据全心全意为人民服务的标准，来检讨过去的思想行为，就发现了很多错误。我在学生时代就关心过国事，五四运动、五卅惨案时的反对帝国主义的斗争，都参加过。罢课游行，宣传演讲，还冒了危险，挨过枪柄，但都只是激于一时的义愤，并没有认清这就是解放运动的一环。学潮一过，仍然想：“还是好好读书罢，先完成了学业才能出来救国。”留美三年，回国时曾赴欧洲各国参观。当时一方面景仰西方“物质文明”，一方面由于受尽了弱国被歧视的痛苦，痛恨帝国主义的侵略，确曾一心救国。但我走错了救国的道路，“教育救国”“建设救国”等改良主义的论调，都是我所醉心过的。“九一八”事变，开始使我对于国民党政府失望。抗日军兴，国共合作，我又一度兴奋起来，以为是中华民族复兴的机会到了。后来国民党反动派又以抗日做招牌，专门进行反共反人民的勾当。这使我悲观失望起来。抗日战争胜利后，国民党反动派又不顾全国人民的和平愿望，发起了对于人民解放区的全面的进攻。我一方面痛恨国民党政府的贪污腐化和无能，又一方面把它当做中国的“正统”，还希望着它可能改善。现在想想，这简直是愚昧无知。直到解放以后，经过学习，才开始认识了革命的真义，认识到中国人民只有团结在共产党的旗帜下，推翻内外反动派的统治，才能翻过身来。我过去虽有点“为国家服务”的思想，但没有认识旧日“国家”的本质，更谈不到人民的立场，实际上是一种改良主义的思想，客观上成了反动派统治中国人民的帮凶。今后我必需丢掉改良主义思想的包袱，彻底改造自己，坚决地全心全意为人民服务，搞好我们人民铁路的建设工作。
    （二）肃清官僚主义和保守思想
    中国铁路建设已经有了八十二年的历史。早期是由帝国主义者代办。后期虽然自办，但在资金的来源，技术标准的制定，建筑材料的采用等等方面，都没有独立自主的能力，处处仰赖帝国主义的鼻息，只是一套半殖民地的办法。从勘测设计、监查、施工，甚至于通车营业管理，都是同一机构一揽子包办。没有周密精确的设计，只粗率地画一张图，自己不直接施工，大概估个价，就包给私商开工，遇到问题临时再想办法，做到那里算那里，更谈不上什么全盘计划。忽而下令限时限刻通车，忽而下令立即停工。要料，料供不上，要款，款不及时。赶工时，粗制滥造，停工时，就搁置不管。这种盲目现象不知浪费了多少人力财力物力。因之过去的经验中包含着严重的官僚主义和保守思想的成分。
    解放以后仍袭用过去一揽子包办的机构。没有周密的计划和设计，只凭着热情“赶”任务。施工方面也还是部分依靠了私营包商，自办的工程也还是采用里工制度。后来学习苏联先进经验，才知道必须要先设计，后施工，按建设程序进行。而勘测设计、监查、施工和通车营业，必须从机构组织上截然分开，否则所有各阶段存在的缺点，无法发觉纠正，如果生产不能专责，也就会阻止整个铁路建设工作的进步。施工方面也不能停留在里工制度上，必须采用企业化的经营管理。
    在一九五一年十月间，铁道部召开了全国铁路工程会议。滕代远部长在总结报告中决定了我们一九五二年新线工程建设方针是：开展设计工作，整理施工，贯彻先设计后施工的原则。对于组织机构，决定先从一揽子包办机构的内部着手分工，把勘测设计、监查、施工和营业管理分立。设计方面，必须遵照初步设计、技术设计、施工详图三个步骤，在规定期限内写出完备的技术设计文件。施工方面决定一九五二年上半年准备企业化的条件，下半年试行企业化的经营管理。并决定在一九五二年必须做好准备工作，来迎接更大规模的铁路建设。但是由于我们出身于小资产阶级，还严重地存在着保守思想和自由主义，过去习惯于自己设计编预算，自己发包检查，自己施工，自己营业使用，就强调改革的困难，再加上官僚主义的作风，以致直到今天还没有把机构分立起来。施工部门既还没有能独立，也就阻碍了它走向企业化的经营管理。
    施工技术上也充满了保守观点。例如：柳江桥的拖拉钢梁工作，没有完全照苏联专家的建议办理
    （主要是拉梁辊轴的方法），以致造成了很大的浪费。吸取了这次经验，沱江桥的拉梁工作就改正了这一点，拉的速度快了七倍半，证明了过去的保守思想是如何地妨碍了工作的进行。但是由于官僚主义的作风，粗枝大叶，没有好好地总结柳江桥的其他经验，以致在加固钢梁、联结架、垫梁、钢缆缠合和滑道作下坡道等时，又犯了好些错误，浪费了国家的资材。在架桥的期间，工人同志们曾经提出过滑道作下坡道和垫梁太弱怕吃不住等的意见，但是我们没有采纳，这也说明了我们对依靠工人阶级的观点，还不够明确。其他如填土打夯的先进工作方法，劳动模范创造的单人冲眼和“竹儿炮”等开挖石方的方法，在西南区的铁路建设工作中早已普遍推行，而最近才推广到西北区的铁路建设工作中去，这也说明了官僚主义和保守思想的存在。
    由于劳动生产率没有详细正确的纪录，特别是还没有正确的合理的先进技术定额，致使我们拘守那些陈旧的经验定额，而远落在工人实际生产率之后。例如：隧道人工开挖坚石导坑工作，包括五十公尺运距在内，过去的经验定额在西北是每立方公尺二十工，天兰线十九号隧道编预算按十工计，而实际测定只要五·六工。大营梁隧道开挖土质导坑工作，编预算每立方公尺按四·二八工计，而实际测定只要一·一工。天兰线四公里处小桥人工打一∶三∶六混凝土工作，包括二十公尺运距在内，编预算每立方公尺按二·二工计，而实际测定只要○·八一工。可是保守思想阻止了我们大胆地提高技术定额，以致每次预算编得都很庞大，严重地积压了国家的流动资金，造成很大的浪费。除此以外，技术定额还有它更积极的意义，它是实行经济核算和计件工资的基础，也就是施工走向企业化的必要条件，所以必须大力推广普遍测定。然而有些干部抱着单纯任务观点，不重视测定工作。例如：西北铁路局工率检定队原来有几个工程师，经过一个阶段的工作后，又调了工作，削弱了测定的力量，也就是阻碍了施工走向企业化的经营管理。
    我们的铁路建设工作，必须吸取苏联的先进经验，根据我们的实际情况，加以运用，才能够求得更好的发展，而不应袭用过去的旧制度，满足于自己狭隘的经验。必须丢掉改良主义思想的包袱，用革命的思想来进行民主改革。必须彻底铲除官僚主义和保守思想，虚心地重新学起，才能使铁路建设走上正规。
