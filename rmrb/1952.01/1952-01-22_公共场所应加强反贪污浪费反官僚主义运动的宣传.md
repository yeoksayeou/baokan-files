    Strengthen the Publicity of the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement in Public Places

    Editor: Currently, a vigorous anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is being carried out across the country. The working people on the streets and in the alleys of Beijing are discussing these matters, and people from all walks of life are mobilizing. However, our government's publicity efforts have not kept pace. I believe that we should expand the publicity network in the same way as we publicized the Resist America, Aid Korea and Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movements. We should post cartoons and slogans in cinemas, trains, buses, and streets to publicize how serious the losses caused to the people by corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are. This kind of publicity will also shock corrupt and wasteful elements. Only in this way can we achieve the effect of "everyone shouting beat him" when a rat crosses the street.

    公共场所应加强反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动的宣传
    编辑同志：现在全国各地开展了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的轰轰烈烈的运动，北京市街头巷尾的劳动人民，都在谈论这些事情，各阶层的人民都动起来了。可是，我们政府的宣传工作还没有赶上去。我认为，我们应像宣传抗美援朝、镇压反革命一样，扩大宣传网。在电影院、火车、公共汽车、街头张贴漫画、标语，进行宣传，使人人明白贪污、浪费、官僚主义给人民所造成的损失是如何的严重。这种宣传，使贪污、浪费分子也会触目惊心。这样才能收到“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的效果。    北京市供销合作总社　傅瑞祥
