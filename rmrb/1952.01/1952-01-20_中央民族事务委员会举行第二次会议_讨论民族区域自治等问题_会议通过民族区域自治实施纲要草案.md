Xinhua News Agency, January 19th:

    The Second (Enlarged) Meeting of the Central People's Government's Nationalities Affairs Commission, which opened on December 14th last year and lasted for eighteen days, closed on December 31st. This meeting summarized the experiences of nationality work over the past two years, discussed important issues such as continuing to promote national regional autonomy, and adopted a draft outline for the implementation of national regional autonomy to be submitted to the Central People's Government for review and adoption, thereby laying the foundation for the further development of nationality work in the future.
    China is a large multi-ethnic country. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the system of national oppression was abolished, and a policy of national equality was implemented, bringing unprecedented unity among all ethnic groups within China. This meeting was convened on the basis of this unprecedented unity. Attending the meeting were the heads of nationality work from various regions, as well as representatives from thirty-nine ethnic minority groups, including the Oroqen, Dongxiang, Va, Lisu, Gaoshan, Dong, Kazakh, Shantou, Miao, Manchu, Tibetan, Yi, Yao, Zhuang, Hui, Dai (Bo, Thai), Minjia, Mongolian, Pianren, Uzbek, Zhongjia, Uyghur, Li, Korean, Luo? , Sani, She, Daur, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Tatar, Sha, Shui, Xibe, Qiu, Nong, Axi, Tu, Benren, and others. The presidium of the congress consisted of twenty-three people, of whom ethnic minorities accounted for more than two-thirds.
    At the meeting, Dong Biwu, Vice Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government, delivered a political report; Li Weihan, Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, delivered a report on nationality policy; Vice Chairman Liu Geping delivered a report on nationality work over the past two years; and Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government, Ulanhu, delivered a report on the work of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Sixty-six people spoke at the meeting, including members of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission and representatives from thirty-six ethnic groups from various regions, as well as heads of nationality affairs commissions from the Northwest, Southwest, Central South, Northeast, and other major administrative regions and provinces and cities. All speakers unanimously expressed their agreement with the reports of Vice Premier Dong, Chairman Li, Vice Chairman Ulanhu, and Vice Chairman Liu. Representatives of various ethnic groups enthusiastically introduced the situation and work experience of their respective ethnic groups in their speeches; and put forward many specific requirements related to nationality work and the development of the political, economic, and cultural aspects of various ethnic minority areas.
    The meeting conducted an in-depth discussion on the policy of national regional autonomy. The meeting believes that national regional autonomy is the key to solving the national question in China. According to the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, regional autonomy should be implemented in areas where various ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, and ethnic autonomous regions and ethnic autonomous organs should be established. All ethnic autonomous regions are inseparable parts of the territory of the People's Republic of China, advancing under the leadership of the Central People's Government along the general path of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and managing the internal affairs of their respective ethnic groups according to the wishes of the majority of the people of their own ethnic group and the leading figures connected with the people. The autonomous organs of the various ethnic autonomous regions are the organs of state power of the people of the autonomous regions, and they enjoy various autonomous rights commensurate with their administrative status under the unified system and plan of the state. The meeting believes that all ethnic autonomous regions and autonomous organs must guarantee that all ethnic groups within the autonomous region enjoy the rights of national equality, must guarantee that the people within the autonomous region, regardless of ethnicity or gender, enjoy the rights of people's freedom, the right to vote and the right to be elected, and must respect the leadership of the people's governments at higher levels. The people's governments at higher levels in the various ethnic autonomous regions must respect the autonomous rights of the various ethnic autonomous regions and, according to the characteristics of the various ethnic autonomous regions, help them develop political, economic, cultural and educational construction undertakings.
    The meeting also discussed issues such as local national democratic united governments, guaranteeing that all scattered ethnic minority components enjoy the rights of national equality, and the organization of nationality affairs commissions of people's governments at all levels. The meeting believes that the establishment of national democratic united governments in areas where ethnic groups live together is to guarantee that all ethnic groups in areas where ethnic groups live together enjoy equal rights in organs of state power, so as to facilitate mutual cooperation and development among all ethnic groups; all ethnic minority components scattered among the Han people due to various historical reasons should be legally guaranteed the same rights as the Han people; in order to further improve nationality work, the relevant people's governments at all levels should establish and strengthen nationality affairs agencies.
    This meeting fully embodies the spirit of national equality and unity. During group discussions and plenary sessions, representatives of all ethnic groups expressed their views in their own ethnic languages in the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything. All documents and speeches at the meeting were translated into Mongolian, Tibetan, and Uyghur. Representatives of all ethnic groups discussed together, learned from each other, and were as close as brothers. They unanimously stated that only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can all ethnic groups happily gather together to discuss major issues related to the unity and development of all ethnic groups. At the meeting, representatives of various ethnic groups and heads of nationality work from various regions also appropriately criticized the remaining ideas of Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism in nationality work.
    Through this meeting, the representatives of all ethnic groups attending the meeting gained a deeper understanding of the greatness of the motherland. Everyone believes that in the future, patriotism and internationalism education should be strengthened among all ethnic minority peoples to further consolidate the unity among all ethnic groups. Representatives of various ethnic groups from the frontier, such as Hu Zongyi, a representative of the Va ethnic group from Yunnan Province, Na Paidu, a representative of the Shantou ethnic group, and Kuerban Duolaiti, a representative of the Tajik ethnic group from Puli County, Xinjiang Province, also stated that participating in this meeting further strengthened their determination to oppose imperialist aggression and their confidence in victory.
    The meeting closed on December 31st. At the closing ceremony, Chairman Li Weihan spoke first, saying: The reason why our meeting has achieved results is mainly due to the leadership of Marxism-Leninism theory and Mao Zedong Thought; at the same time, it is also inseparable from the experience gained through the joint efforts of the people's governments, Communist Party, People's Liberation Army cadres, and people of all ethnic groups in various ethnic regions over the past two years. He then emphasized: As long as all our comrades can well combine Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the actual conditions of our various ethnic regions in China, our work will achieve greater results, and our mistakes and shortcomings will be less than before. Regarding the suggestions and requests made by the representatives, Li Weihan explained that the Nationalities Affairs Commission will study and deal with them in conjunction with the relevant ministries and local governments and give a reply. Then Zhang Xiruo, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, delivered a closing speech. At the meeting, all the representatives unanimously passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the People's Liberation Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and sent a telegram of condolences to the people of all ethnic groups in the Lijiang area of Yunnan Province, who recently suffered from an earthquake disaster. The telegram from the local government of Tibet and Panchen Erdeni to the conference was also read out at the meeting. Amidst lasting applause, the meeting successfully concluded.

    中央民族事务委员会举行第二次会议
    讨论民族区域自治等问题
    会议通过民族区域自治实施纲要草案
    【新华社十九日讯】去年十二月十四日开幕的中央人民政府民族事务委员会第二次（扩大）会议，历时十八天，已在十二月三十一日闭幕。这次会议，总结了两年来民族工作的经验，讨论了继续推行民族区域自治等重要问题，并通过了民族区域自治实施纲要草案提供中央人民政府审核采择，从而为今后民族工作的进一步开展打下了基础。
    中国是个多民族的大国。中华人民共和国成立后，废除了民族压迫制度，实行了民族平等政策，使中国境内各民族达到了空前的团结。这次会议就是在这个空前团结的基础上召开的。出席会议的有各地民族工作的负责人和鄂伦春、东乡、佧佤、傈僳、高山、侗、哈萨克、山头、苗、满、藏、彝、瑶、僮、回、傣（僰、泰）、民家、蒙、偏人、乌兹别克、仲家、维吾尔、黎、朝鲜、倮?、撒尼、畲、达呼尔、柯尔克兹、塔吉克、塔塔尔、沙、水家、锡伯、俅、侬、阿细、土族、本人等三十九个少数民族单位，大会主席团由二十三人组成，其中少数民族成分占三分之二以上。
    在会议上，中央人民政府政务院副总理董必武作了政治报告，中央人民政府民族事务委员会主任委员李维汉作了关于民族政策的报告，副主任委员刘格平作了两年来民族工作的报告，副主任委员、内蒙古自治区人民政府主席乌兰夫作了关于内蒙古自治区工作的报告。在大会上发言的有六十六人，包括中央民族事务委员会委员和来自各地的三十六个民族单位的代表，以及西北、西南、中南、东北等大行政区和各省、市民族事务委员会负责人。所有发言人都一致表示同意董副总理、李主任委员、乌副主任委员、刘副主任委员的报告。各民族代表在发言中都兴奋地介绍了本民族的情况和工作经验；并提出了许多有关民族工作的意见和发展各少数民族地区政治、经济、文化的具体要求。
    会议对民族区域自治政策作了深入的讨论。会议认为：民族的区域自治是解决中国民族问题的钥匙。依据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，各少数民族聚居的地区应实行区域自治，建立民族自治区和民族自治机关。各民族自治区都是中华人民共和国领土上不可分离的一部分，在中央人民政府的领导下遵循着中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的总道路前进，并按照本民族大多数人民及与人民有联系的领袖人物的志愿管理本民族内部的事务。各民族自治区的自治机关是自治区人民的政权机关，它在国家统一的制度和计划之下，都享有与其行政地位相称的各项自治权利。会议认为：各民族自治区、自治机关，必须保障自治区内各民族皆享有民族平等权利，必须保障自治区内人民，不分民族和性别，均享有人民自由权利及选举权和被选举权，必须尊重上级人民政府的领导。而各民族自治区的上级人民政府则必须尊重各民族自治区的自治权利，并根据各民族自治区的特点，去帮助其发展政治、经济和文化教育等建设事业。
    会议还讨论了地方民族民主联合政府、保障一切散居的少数民族成分享有民族平等权利和各级人民政府民族事务委员会的组织等问题。会议认为：在民族杂居地区建立民族民主联合政府，是为了保障民族杂居地区各民族在政权机关中享有平等权利，以利于各民族相互合作和发展；对于因各种历史上的原因而散居在汉族居民中的一切少数民族成分，应该在法律上保障他们和汉族人民享有同样的权利；为了进一步做好民族工作，有关的各级人民政府应建立和加强民族事务机构。
    这次会议充分体现了民族平等、团结的精神。在小组研究、大会讨论时，各民族代表都本着知无不言，言无不尽的精神，用本民族语言表达了自己的心意。会议上的各种文件和发言，都译成了蒙、藏、维文。各民族代表共同商讨，互相学习，亲如兄弟。他们一致表示只有在毛主席、共产党的领导下，各民族才能这样亲密地欢聚一堂，讨论有关各民族团结和发展的重大问题。会上，各民族代表和各地民族工作的负责人还适当地批判了在民族工作中的大民族主义和狭隘民族主义的残余思想。
    经过这次会议，与会的各民族代表更加深刻地认识到祖国的伟大。大家认为：今后应在一切少数民族人民中加强爱国主义和国际主义的教育，更进一步巩固各民族间的团结。来自边疆的各民族代表，如云南省的佧佤族代表胡宗义、山头族代表纳排都、新疆省蒲犁县的塔吉克族代表库尔班·多列提等并表示：参加了这次会议，更加强了反对帝国主义侵略的决心和胜利信心。
    会议在十二月三十一日闭幕。在闭幕会上，首由李维汉主任委员发言，他说：我们这次会议之所以获得成绩，主要是依靠了马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东思想的领导；同时，和这两年来各个民族地区的人民政府、共产党、人民解放军的干部和各族人民的共同努力所获得的经验也是分不开的。他接着着重指出：只要我们所有的同志能够很好地把马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想同我们中国各民族地区的实际情况结合起来，我们的工作就会得到更大的成绩，我们的错误和缺点就会比以前更少一点。关于各位代表所提的建议和要求，李维汉说明即将由民族事务委员会与各有关部会和地方政府研究处理，并予以答复。继由中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会副主任张奚若致闭幕词。会上，全体代表一致通过向毛主席、朱总司令和人民解放军、中国人民志愿军致敬的电文，并致电慰问最近遭受地震灾害的云南省丽江专区的各族人民。会上还宣读了西藏地方政府和班禅额尔德尼致大会的电文。在经久不息的掌声中，会议胜利结束。
