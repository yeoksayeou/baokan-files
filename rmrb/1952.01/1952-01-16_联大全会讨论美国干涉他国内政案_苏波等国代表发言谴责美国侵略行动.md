(Xinhua News Agency, January 15th) According to TASS, Paris: The United Nations General Assembly discussed at its plenary session on the 11th the Soviet Union's proposal to accuse the United States of carrying out subversive and destructive activities against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. The proposal requested the United Nations General Assembly to condemn the "Mutual Security Act" promulgated by the US government on October 10, 1951, and suggested that the US government abolish this law. This law stipulates the appropriation of 100 million US dollars to fund subversive and destructive activities against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

As early as last December, this proposal had already been discussed in the Political Committee. This discussion was a real trial for the American aggressors, who were placed in the dock before the people of the world. The speeches of the representatives of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Byelorussia, and Ukraine irrefutably proved that this law was an unprecedented violation of international law and the fundamental principles of the UN Charter, as well as the 1933 Soviet-American Agreement. At this plenary meeting, the Soviet delegation reiterated its proposal. The head of the Soviet delegation, Vishinsky, made a long speech. He mercilessly attacked the attempts of the US representatives to defend their own crimes. He clearly pointed out that the so-called "Mutual Security Act" is an interference in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, which is to form armed forces from bandits, traitors, and quislings who have fled from these countries, and then send them to these countries to engage in sabotage and terrorist activities, arson, destruction of factories, and killing of people. He solemnly pointed out that such interference would cause serious international conflicts, and he demanded that the US government change this attempt and abolish this law.

The General Assembly finally voted on the Soviet proposal. As in the Political Committee, although the Soviet proposal was vetoed by the US-British majority in the United Nations, about one-third of the delegations refused to follow the United States in opposing the Soviet accusations. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted in favor. Afghanistan, Burma, Egypt, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, that is to say, almost all the delegations from the Middle East, Near East, and Asia abstained.

    联大全会讨论美国干涉他国内政案
    苏波等国代表发言谴责美国侵略行动
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会在十一日的全体会议上，讨论了苏联控诉美国对苏联和人民民主国家进行颠覆与破坏活动的提案，这个提案要求联合国大会谴责美国政府在一九五一年十月十日所颁布的“共同安全法”，并建议美国政府废除这个法律。这个法律规定拨款一亿美元，资助对苏联和人民民主国家进行颠覆和破坏活动。
    早在去年十二月，这个提案即已在政治委员会中进行过讨论。这种讨论是对于美国侵略者的一次真正的审判，他们在全世界人民面前被置于被告席上。苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、白俄罗斯和乌克兰代表的发言，无可辩驳地证明了这个法律是史无前例地违反了国际法和联合国宪章的基本原则以及一九三三年的苏美协定。这次在全体会议上，苏联代表团再度提出了它的提案。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基作了长篇发言。他毫不留情地打击了美国代表企图为他们自己的罪状申辩的企图。他清楚地指出，所谓“共同安全法”，就是对苏联和人民民主国家的内政的干涉，就是把从这些国家中逃出的盗匪、叛徒和卖国贼组成武装部队，再派到这些国家来从事破坏和恐怖活动，纵火焚烧或炸毁工厂、杀害人民。他严正地指出，这种干涉会造成严重的国际冲突，他要求美国政府改变这种企图，取消这个法律。
    大会最后就苏联的提案进行了表决，和在政治委员会中一样，虽然苏联提案遭到了联合国中美英多数的否决，但是约有三分之一的代表团拒绝追随美国来反对苏联的控诉。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克投赞成票，阿富汗、缅甸、埃及、危地马拉、印度、印尼、伊朗、巴基斯坦、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和也门，就是说，差不多中东、近东和亚洲所有国家的代表团都弃权。
