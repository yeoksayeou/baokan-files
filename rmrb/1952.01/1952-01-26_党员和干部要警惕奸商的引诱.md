In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, various localities have exposed the ugly behavior of unscrupulous merchants colluding with and enticing Communist Party members and cadres. This is extremely gratifying news.

As far as I know, unscrupulous merchants often entice certain cadres in the following ways:

One day, Comrade Lao Yang from a certain organization was discussing a transaction with an unscrupulous merchant when he suddenly received a letter from home. The letter said that his sister-in-law and nephew wanted to visit him in Tianjin but did not have the travel expenses. This unscrupulous merchant immediately copied down the address of Comrade Yang's sister-in-law and sent one million yuan on Comrade Yang's behalf. Comrade Yang was extremely insensitive to the unscrupulous merchant's bribery and not only failed to expose it but also regarded this unscrupulous merchant as a "friend."

A Comrade Zhao was having a coat made at a tailor shop, which an unscrupulous merchant learned about. The unscrupulous merchant not only went to the tailor shop to pay Comrade Zhao's labor costs and collect the coat but also bought many shirts, socks, and the like and gave them all to Comrade Zhao. Comrade Zhao even accepted them, greedy for small gains.

During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle, a certain organization discovered that six purchasing agents had been enticed by unscrupulous merchants. One of them bought public goods at a store and then bought a plate for himself, which the merchant refused to charge for. Another purchasing agent bought jars, and the merchant gave him one for free. Purchasing agent Lao Liu often frequented a store. One day, he went to buy two jin of noodles for his own use, and the store insisted on not charging him. It was not until the store owner introduced him to a wife that he realized the unscrupulous merchant was enticing him. Two other purchasing agents went to a store to buy public goods, and the unscrupulous merchant asked, "How should I write your invoice?" Comrade Huang, a purchasing agent, had frequent dealings with a vegetable merchant. The vegetable merchant gave him a scarf, which he accepted without hesitation. One day, the vegetable merchant wanted to charge him the price of good vegetables for inferior ones, but Comrade Huang refused. The vegetable merchant said, "You're not being a good friend!" This one sentence alerted Comrade Huang.

The unscrupulous merchants buy clothes for some comrades, pay labor costs, send noodles, send plates, send scarves, and even "automatically" solve the family difficulties of some comrades. What is their purpose? Their purpose is to make certain comrades "good friends" with the unscrupulous merchants and have them do things for the unscrupulous merchants. They want us to nominally be "Communist Party members" but essentially be the henchmen of unscrupulous merchants, stealing state property.

Some Communist Party members and cadres have fallen into the mire this way. The aforementioned Lao Yang and Lao Zhao reflected that they had spoken favorably of capitalists and allowed capitalists to gain undue benefits. In a word, they lost the stance of a Communist Party member.

Chairman Mao warned us in 1949: Do not be defeated by the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets. What do sugar-coated bullets actually look like? When they first appear, they are actually noodles, scarves, socks, shirts, jars, cigarettes, and the like. If we are vigilant, do not seek petty advantages, do not indulge in pleasure-seeking, maintain a hard-working style, and draw a clear line between ourselves and the bourgeoisie, not swallowing any form of "bullet," then we will not become prisoners of unscrupulous merchants and will not be corrupted by bourgeois ideology.

    党员和干部要警惕奸商的引诱
    曾习三
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，各地纷纷揭露奸商勾引共产党员、干部的丑恶行为，这是一件极大的喜事。
    据我知道的，奸商常常这样来诱惑某些干部：
    某机关的老杨同志，一天正和某奸商谈交易，忽然接到一封家信。信上说，他的嫂子和侄儿要到天津来看他，没有路费。这个奸商马上把杨同志嫂嫂的地址抄下来，代杨同志寄去了一百万元。对奸商的贿赂丑行，杨同志表现得十分麻痹，不仅没有加以揭露，反而把这个奸商当作了“朋友”。
    有一位赵同志，在成衣店做大衣，被一个奸商知道了。奸商不但到成衣店为赵同志付了工钱，取出了大衣，而且又买了许多衬衣、袜子之类，一起送给了赵同志。赵同志竟然贪图小利地收下了。
    某机关在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争中，发现六个采买员都受过奸商的引诱。其中有一个采买员在商店买了公物以后，自己又买了一个盘子，商家不要钱。另一个采买员买缸子，商家白送给了他。采买员老刘和一家商店常常来往，有一天，他去买二斤挂面自用，商店里硬是不要钱。直到这个商店的老板给他介绍老婆时，他才发觉奸商在引诱他。另有两个采买员到商店去买公用物品，奸商问：“你的发票怎么开？”采买员黄同志和卖菜商人的来往多了，卖菜商人送给他一条围巾，他毫不介意地收下了。有一天，菜商要拿次菜算好菜的价钱，黄同志不答应，菜商说：“你真不够朋友！”这一句话倒把黄同志警醒了。
    奸商给某些同志买衣服，付工钱，送挂面，送盘子，送围巾，甚至“自动”给某些同志解决家庭困难，目的在那里呢？目的就是要某些同志在奸商面前“够朋友”，给奸商办事。要我们名义上当“共产党员”，实质上当奸商的狗腿子，盗窃国家的财产。
    有些共产党员、干部，就是这样掉下泥坑去的。前述的老杨和老赵曾反省说，他们给资本家说过好话，让资本家得过不应得的好处。一句话，他们丧失了共产党员的立场。
    毛主席在一九四九年就警告过我们：不要被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹打败。糖衣炮弹究竟是什么样子呢？它在最初出现时，竟是挂面、围巾、袜子、衬衣、缸子、香烟之类。我们如果提高警惕，不贪小便宜，不贪图享乐，能够保持艰苦作风，能够划清我们和资产阶级的界限，不把任何形式的“炮弹”吞下去，那末我们便不会当奸商的俘虏，不会被资产阶级思想所腐蚀。
