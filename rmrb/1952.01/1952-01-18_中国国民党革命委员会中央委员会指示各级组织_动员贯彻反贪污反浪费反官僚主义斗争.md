[This dispatch is] from our newspaper:

    The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued instructions on January 15 to all subordinate organizations regarding the campaign to increase production and practice economy and the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The instructions called on local organizations at all levels to urge all party members, and mobilize the masses they are connected with, to raise their awareness and boldly expose [problems], and to strive to implement this central political task. The instructions explained that the basic policy for carrying out this movement is: ruthless exposure, strict inspection, and handling of cases individually, in order to achieve the goals of rectifying thinking, changing the atmosphere, improving systems, saving expenses, and improving work efficiency. The instructions required local organizations to establish economy inspection committees, to work under the guidance of the provincial and municipal consultative committees, and to absorb representatives of cadres and service personnel at all levels to participate in the inspection agencies. During the movement, the responsible persons of organizations at all levels must take personal action, earnestly mobilize the masses, and promote democracy. If any leading cadres suppress democracy, their leadership should be immediately suspended or revoked. Regarding the progress of the movement, the instructions put forward specific steps: The first stage is to study documents, so as to have some understanding of this movement and eliminate ideological concerns. The second stage is to launch exposure, which should be led by leading cadres taking the lead in self-criticism, with inspections from top to bottom, mutual inspections, and universal exposure of the phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The third stage is to conduct confessions and accusations. The instructions require local organizations to urge the branch or group in its subordinate organization to play an active role in its own organization, influence the masses, and lead the masses, so that the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the organization can be done better.
