Shanghai District People's Representative Conferences Change Extravagant and Wasteful Practices

Recently, the second sessions of the People's Representative Conferences in various districts of Shanghai have all implemented the spirit of opposing extravagance and waste.

    For example, when the Jiangning District People's Representative Conference was held, most of the documents were printed using the old district government's household registration records. In the past, items such as the "Conference Agenda" and "Presidium List" were printed as booklets, but now they have been streamlined and replaced with wall posters, saving a lot of paper and printing costs. Previously, working comrades wore yellow satin work permits on their chests, but this time they were replaced with paper ones. The conference did not provide meals for the representatives, and cigarettes were not provided during the meetings. Other wasteful phenomena, such as sending pennants and hanging congratulatory banners, have also disappeared. The pre-conference arrangements were all made by working comrades and residents, and the venue was simple and unadorned. Not only were savings made in terms of materials, but there were also improvements in the use of manpower and time. This conference saved two-thirds of the expenses compared to the previous conference, and the conference was very successful. I believe this approach is worth learning from in various places.

The Chaotic Cashier Work of the Runan County People's Bank Should Be Inspected and Corrected Quickly

    The cadres in charge of cashier work at the Runan County People's Bank in Henan Province are careless in their work, causing serious chaos. On December 13, the county's employee consumer cooperative went to the bank to withdraw 4 million yuan, but the bank overpaid them by 2 million yuan. When the person withdrawing the money realized that there was too much money, they immediately returned the excess amount to the bank. On another occasion, the First District Supply and Marketing Cooperative went to the bank to withdraw money, and the bank also overpaid by 200,000 yuan. When the supply and marketing cooperative returned the extra money to the bank, they actually refused to accept it. This bank also frequently makes underpayments. For example, in more than 20 previous withdrawals by the First District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, they found a shortage of 212,000 yuan, which the bank never made up. I suggest that the Runan County Bank quickly inspect and correct this irresponsible work style.

    来信摘要
    上海市各区召开的人民代表会议改变了铺张浪费现象
    最近，上海市各区召开的第二次各界人民代表会议，都贯彻了反对铺张浪费的精神。
    如江宁区人民代表会议开会时，大部分的文件都利用伪区公所户口名册印成。过去，“大会议程”“主席团名单”等都要印成小册子，现在都精简了，改用墙报方式，省去了不少纸张和印刷费。以前工作同志胸前佩带的是黄缎子的工作证，这次都改用纸做的了。大会不招待代表吃饭。开会时一律不供给香烟。其他如送锦旗、乱挂贺幛等浪费现象，也绝迹了。大会开会前的布置工作，都由工作同志和居民作，会场简单朴素。不但在物质方面做到节约，在人力和时间使用上，也有了改进。这次会议比上次会议节省了三分之二的费用，会议开得很好。我认为这种作法值得各地学习。

    汝南县人民银行出纳工作混乱应速检查纠正
    河南省汝南县人民银行负责出纳工作的干部，在工作中粗枝大叶，造成了严重的混乱现象。十二月十三日，县职工消费合作社到银行取款四百万元，银行竟多付给二百万元。取款人发觉款多了，马上就把多取部分退还银行。又一次，第一区供销合作社到银行取款，银行也多付给二十万元。供销社把多取的款退给银行时，他们竟拒绝不要。这个银行也常发生少付款的情形，如一区供销社在以前二十多次领款当中，发现短少二十一万二千元，后来银行也没补给。我建议汝南县银行迅速检查和纠正这种不负责任的工作作风。
