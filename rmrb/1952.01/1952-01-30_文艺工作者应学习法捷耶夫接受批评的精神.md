    Literary Workers Should Learn from Fadeyev's Spirit of Accepting Criticism

    Editor: I read Li He's article "A Model of Criticism and Self-Criticism in Soviet Literature" in the People's Daily on January 19th. I believe that Fadeyev's acceptance of criticism and revision of "The Young Guard" is an event of great educational significance, and Fadeyev's work has set an example for our literary circles. As Li He said, Fadeyev's "spirit of completing self-criticism with practical actions is worth learning from by our country's literary workers."

    Fadeyev's behavior tells us that a revolutionary literary worker must adopt a "Bolshevik attitude towards criticism," which "is an important source of progress for writers and the creation of good works." Fadeyev's spirit of dealing with criticism and self-criticism is precisely what our literary workers urgently need. I hope that this rectification and study movement in Beijing's literary circles can be launched more widely and deeply throughout the country. Literary workers should learn from Fadeyev, not only humbly accepting criticism and correcting mistakes for bad works, but also humbly listening to other people's opinions and seeking further improvement even for the shortcomings of relatively successful works. At the same time, I hope that the literary criticism of critics and the broad masses can be well and timely combined to fight for the elimination of erroneous ideas in literary works and to adhere to the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers!

    文艺工作者应学习法捷耶夫接受批评的精神
    编辑同志：我在一月十九日的人民日报上看到李何写的“苏联文学中批评和自我批评的典型”一文。我认为法捷耶夫接受批评改写“青年近卫军”，是富于教育意义的事件，法捷耶夫的这一个工作给我们文艺界树立了一个榜样。正如李何所说，法捷耶夫“以实际行动来完成自我批评的精神，是值得我国文艺工作者学习的”。
    法捷耶夫的行为告诉我们：一个革命的文艺工作者，必须采取“布尔什维克式的对待批评的态度”，这种态度“是作家进步和好作品产生的重要源泉”。法捷耶夫对待批评和自我批评的精神，正是我们文艺工作者所最迫切需要的。我希望这次北京文艺界的整风学习运动，能够更广泛更深入地在全国展开，文艺工作者应向法捷耶夫学习，不但对坏的作品要虚心地接受批评，改正错误，而且即使对较成功的作品中的缺点，也必须虚心听取别人的意见，求得更进一步的提高。同时，希望文艺批评家和广大群众的文艺批评很好地、很及时地结合起来，为消灭文艺作品中的错误思想，坚持为工农兵服务的方向而斗争！　　余传绂
