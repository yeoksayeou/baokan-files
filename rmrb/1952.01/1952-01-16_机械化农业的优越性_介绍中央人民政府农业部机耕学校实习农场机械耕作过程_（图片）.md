The Agricultural Mechanization School of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government is a specialized school for training mechanical cadres for state-owned farms. The school has an attached training farm. This is the situation of using a 92-horsepower "Stalin 80" tractor to pull two five-bottom plows to plow the land in the training farm. In this way, 15 to 24 mu of ripened land can be plowed per hour (25 cm deep), which is 20 to 30 times higher than the working efficiency of an animal-powered plow.

A 92-horsepower "Stalin 80" tractor is connected to three sets of 41-disc disc harrows for harrowing work. On average, it can harrow 65 to 80 mu of land per hour (10 cm deep), which is 22 to 27 times greater than the working efficiency of animal-powered wooden harrows.

Using a 54-horsepower "Natz" tractor connected to three sets of 24-row seeders to sow seeds, 65 mu can be sown per hour, which is 30 times more efficient than using a horse-drawn seed drill.

After wheat sowing, in order to maintain a certain looseness of the soil and remove weeds, intertillage should be carried out in a timely manner when the seedlings are about 10 cm high. This is the situation of using a 12-horsepower small tractor carrying an intertiller for intertillage. Using this type of machinery for intertillage can intertill 12 to 15 mu of land per hour, which is 30 to 50 times more efficient than manual hoeing.

This is the situation of the training farm of the Agricultural Mechanization School using a self-propelled combine harvester to harvest wheat. This harvester can not only complete the three parts of harvesting, threshing and cleaning on one machine at the same time, but also is equipped with power equipment, does not require tractor traction, and only requires one person to master the entire work. The self-propelled combine harvester can harvest 22 to 24 mu of grain and bean crops per hour, saving 240 man-hours compared to farmers using sickles to cut and manual and animal power threshing and cleaning. The harvester is also equipped with lighting equipment and can continue to work at night.

The function of the tractor-pulled combine harvester is the same as that of the self-propelled combine harvester, but this type of harvester must be pulled by a tractor. At the same time, its cutting part is installed on the side, and it can harvest nearly 1 zhang and 5 chi (approximately 5 meters) wide of grain crops at a time. The efficiency is even higher than that of the self-propelled combine harvester. It can harvest 26.7 mu of grain crops per hour, which is more than 250 times higher than the working efficiency of a farmer using a sickle to cut, a stone roller to thresh, and winnowing. Moreover, the grain cleaning is also relatively cleaner.

In 1951, industrial labor models and agricultural labor models who were invited to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations visited the mechanized farming process at this farm and deeply felt the superiority of mechanized agriculture. This is the situation when they visited the horse-drawn binder.

The Guangbei State-owned Farm is located in the north of Guangrao County, Shandong Province, which was originally a saline-alkali wasteland on the edge of the Bohai Sea. However, under the leadership of the People's Government, the farm began to be established here in the spring of 1950, using machinery and modern science and technology to transform the soil, turning barren alkaline land into fertile land, and growing lush crops. This is the endless wheat field of the Guangbei State-owned Farm.

The wheat is ripe, and the large harvesting machines start to drive to the wheat field to carry out harvesting work.

This is the situation of the "Stalin No. 6" tractor-pulled combine harvester carrying out wheat harvesting work. The cutting width of this harvester is 4.9 meters, the loading capacity is 1,200 kilograms each time, and it can harvest 26.7 mu of wheat field per hour.

The harvester unloads the threshed wheat grains into the transport vehicle.

Agricultural labor models from various districts of Guangrao County visited the farm's mechanical wheat harvesting and were carefully observing the cutting action of this harvester.

Tractor-pulled combine harvesters are active in the vast wheat fields, working intensely.

    机械化农业的优越性
    ——介绍中央人民政府农业部机耕学校实习农场机械耕作过程——
    中央人民政府农业部机耕学校是一个训练国营农场机械干部的专门学校。学校附设有实习农场。这是在实习农场里使用九十二匹马力“斯大林八十号”拖拉机牵引两个五铧犁耕地时的情形。这样每小时可耕熟地十五亩到二十四亩（耕深二十五公分），比一具畜力犁的工作效率要高二十倍到三十倍。
    九十二匹马力“斯大林八十号”拖拉机连接三台四十一片圆盘耕进行耙地工作，每小时平均可以耙地六十五亩到八十亩（耙深十公分），比用畜力拖用木制土耙的工作效率大二十二倍到二十七倍。
    用五十四匹马力“纳齐”拖拉机连接三台二十四行条播机进行播种工作，每小时可以播种六十五亩，比马拉耠子的工作效率高三十倍。
    小麦播种后，为了使土壤保持一定的松度和铲除杂草，在苗高约十公分时，就应该适时地进行一次中耕。这是使用十二匹马力小型拖拉机携带中耕机中耕时的情形，利用这种机械进行中耕工作，每小时可以中耕十二亩到十五亩土地，比人力锄头中耕的工作效率要大三十倍到五十倍。
    这是机耕学校实习农场使用自动联合收割机收割小麦时的情形。这种收割机不但能把收割、脱粒和清选三部分的工作在一部机器上同时完成，而且装有动力设备，不需要拖拉机牵引，只要一个人就可以掌握全部工作。自动联合收割机每小时能收割二十二亩到二十四亩谷类和豆类作物，比农民用镰刀刈割和人畜力脱粒、清选等工作节省二百四十个人工。收割机并装有照明设备，在夜间仍可继续工作。
    拖拉联合收割机和自动联合收割机的功用是相同的，不过这种收割机必需要用拖拉机牵引，同时它的剪割部分装在侧面，一次可以收割将近一丈五尺地宽的谷类作物，效率比自动联合收割机更高，每小时可以收割二六·七亩谷类作物，比一个农民用镰刀刈割、石滚子脱粒、扬场等工作的工作效率要高二百五十倍以上，而且籽粒清选也比较干净。
    一九五一年应邀来京参加国庆节观礼的工业劳动模范和农业劳动模范，曾到这个农场去参观机械化耕作的过程，深深地感觉到机械化农业的优越性。这是他们在参观马拉捆割机时的情形。
    国营广北农场在山东省广饶县的北部，原是渤海边上的一片盐碱荒地。但是在人民政府领导下，一九五○年春天就开始在这里设立农场，使用机械及现代化科学技术来改造土壤，把荒土碱地变成了良田沃土，长上了茂盛的庄稼。这是国营广北农场一望无际的麦田。
    麦子熟了，大队收割机开始驶向麦田去进行收割工作。
    这是“斯大林六号”拖拉联合收割机进行收割小麦工作时的情形。这种收割机的割刀宽度为四米九，装载量每次是一千二百公斤，每小时可以收割二六·七亩麦田。
    收割机将打下的麦粒卸入运输车中。
    广饶县各区农业劳动模范参观农场机械收割小麦时，正在细心地观察这种收割机的剪割动作。
    拖拉联合收割机活跃在广阔的麦田里，紧张地工作着。
