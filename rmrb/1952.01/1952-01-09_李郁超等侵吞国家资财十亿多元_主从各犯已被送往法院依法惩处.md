    Li Yuchao and Others Embezzle Over 1 Billion Yuan in State Assets; Principal and Accessory Offenders Have Been Sent to Court for Punishment According to Law

    Li Yuchao, the deputy manager of the Zhejiang Provincial Branch of the China Oil and Fat Company (hereinafter referred to as the Zhejiang Oil and Fat Branch), colluded with Xia Zhaoxuan, Wu Jinrong, Chai Yaozong, and Fu Huaijiu, employees of the Hangzhou Office of the pseudo-China Vegetable Oil Factory, when Zhejiang was about to be liberated. They collectively concealed materials belonging to the Kuomintang bureaucratic enterprise to evade government takeover. After liberation, they continued to steal and sell the hidden materials, and abused their power by colluding with unscrupulous merchants to embezzle the fixed funds of the public-private joint purchase of oil materials and evade cash management. The Li Yuchao group stole a total of 1,000,613,000 yuan in state assets. This major collective embezzlement case led by Li Yuchao has been verified by the Zhejiang Provincial People's Supervisory Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Zhejiang Provincial People's Supervisory Committee). A notice was issued to remove Li Yuchao from his position and hand him over to judicial organs for punishment according to law, and it was recommended that judicial organs arrest Wu Jinrong and others for punishment according to law.

    Li Yuchao, the deputy manager of the Zhejiang Provincial Branch of the Oil and Fat Company, was originally the deputy manager of the Hangzhou Office of the pseudo-China Vegetable Oil Factory, a Kuomintang bureaucratic capital enterprise, before liberation. When Zhejiang was liberated, Li Yuchao colluded with the warehouse director of this office, Chai Yaozong, the acting financial director, Xia Zhaoxuan, the business director, Fu Huaijiu, and the business commissioner, Wu Jinrong, to set up fictitious business organizations and conceal a large number of materials in a planned way. First, they used fifty barrels of tea oil, a bad debt of the pseudo-Quanhua Company (a sister company of the pseudo-China Vegetable Oil Factory), to exchange for fifty barrels (185 dan) of tea oil in stock from the Hangzhou Office of the pseudo-China Vegetable Oil Factory as capital to open the pseudo-Zhijiang Company in Hangzhou. Then, they opened a welfare company in the name of employees, with Fu Huaijiu as the manager. Xia Zhaoxuan and others also stole funds from the Hangzhou Office of the pseudo-China Vegetable Oil Factory to open a welfare cooperative. Li Yuchao, fearing that workers would report and accuse him after liberation, spread rumors to intimidate the workers: "Even if the Communist Party comes to Jiangnan, it will not last long. Whoever dares to say too much, be careful of your own head!" He also burned the account books of the welfare cooperative. At that time, he convened meetings to divide the spoils. In the second division of spoils alone, Li Yuchao received more than twenty taels of gold and two hundred silver dollars. At the third division of spoils meeting, he fabricated accounts and arranged methods for hiding materials. After the meeting, he dispersed and hid 370 pieces of tallow, 184 barrels of tung oil, sesame oil, machine oil, gasoline, etc., to evade government takeover. After liberation, Li Yuchao and others, in addition to handing over 200 shi of rice from the welfare cooperative to the government, secretly appropriated the remaining 100+ shi of rice, more than 460 bolts of cloth, and edible oil, etc. for their own use. After Li Yuchao was retained as the deputy manager of the Zhejiang Oil and Fat Branch, not only did he not repent and atone for his crimes, but he continued to steal and sell the hidden materials to enrich himself. When selling the materials, he disrupted prices and disturbed the market. In addition, Li Yuchao used his power to collude with private merchants. During the preparation of the "Public-Private Joint Purchase of Oil Materials," he used the name of joint purchase to allow unscrupulous merchants to embezzle a large amount of fixed funds (totaling 2.7 billion yuan, of which the Zhejiang Oil and Fat Branch's investment accounted for 35%), evading cash management. According to the above, the state assets stolen by Li Yuchao and others before and after liberation were worth a total of 1,000,613,000 yuan in Renminbi.

    The major case of Li Yuchao and others hiding and stealing large quantities of state materials for a long time was discovered on June 11th of last year when the Zhejiang Provincial People's Supervisory Committee inspected the Hangzhou warehouse of the Zhejiang Oil and Fat Branch, and the inspection ended on July 18th. On November 29th, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Supervisory Committee issued a handling notice and sent the above-mentioned criminals to the court for punishment according to law. (Jiang Si)

    李郁超等侵吞国家资财十亿多元
    主从各犯已被送往法院依法惩处
    中国油脂公司浙江省分公司（下简称浙江油脂分公司）副经理李郁超，在浙江快解放时，伙同伪中国植物油料厂杭州办事处职员夏照暄、吴锦荣、柴耀宗、傅怀九等，集体隐藏国民党官僚企业物资，逃避人民政府接管；解放后，继续盗卖隐藏物资；并利用职权，勾结奸商，套用油料公私联购处固定资金，逃避现金管理。李犯等共计盗窃国家资财十亿零六百一十三万元。以李郁超为首的这一集体贪污巨案，已由浙江省人民政府人民监察委员会（下简称浙江省人民监察委员会）检查属实，通报撤销李郁超职务，交司法机关依法惩处，并建议司法机关逮捕吴锦荣等人，依法惩处。
    浙江省油脂分公司副经理李郁超，解放前原为国民党官僚资本企业——伪中国植物油料厂杭州办事处副经理，当浙江解放时，李郁超勾结这个办事处的仓库主任柴耀宗、代理财务主任夏照暄、业务主任傅怀九，业务专员吴锦荣等，有计划地虚设企业机构，隐藏大批物资。他们首先用伪全华公司（伪中国植物油料厂兄弟公司）呆账五十桶茶油，换取伪中国植物油料厂杭州办事处现货茶油五十桶（一百八十五担）作为资金，在杭州开设伪之江公司。接着又假借职工名义，开设福利公司，由傅怀九任经理。夏照暄等又窃用伪中国植物油料厂杭州办事处资金，开设福利合作社。李郁超深恐解放后工人检举告发，曾向工人造谣恫吓：“共产党即使来江南，决不会长久。谁敢多说多道，小心自己脑袋！”并把福利合作社的账册烧毁。当时他曾召开会议分赃。仅在第二次分赃时，李郁超即分到二十余两黄金，二百枚银元。在第三次分赃会上，他又假造账目，布置了隐藏物资的办法。会后即分散隐藏了桕油三百七十件，青油、桐油、麻油、机油、汽油等一百八十四桶，逃避人民政府接管。解放后，李郁超等除把福利合作社二百石大米交人民政府接管外，竟将其余大米一百余石、布四百六十余匹及食油等物窃为私有。李郁超被留用为浙江油脂分公司副经理后，不但不知悔改，立功赎罪，反陆续盗卖隐藏的物资以自肥。他在盗卖物资时，破坏物价，扰乱市场。此外，李郁超更利用职权，勾结私商，在筹备“油料公私联购处”的过程中，借联购之名，任奸商套用大批固定资金（共二十七亿，其中浙江省油脂分公司投资占百分之三十五），逃避现金管理。据上所述，李郁超等在解放前后所盗窃的国家资财共值人民币十亿零六百一十三万元。
    李郁超等长期隐藏、盗窃大批国家物资巨案，在去年六月十一日，浙江省人民监察委员会检查浙江油脂分公司杭州仓库时发觉，至七月十八日检查结束。十一月二十九日，浙江省人民政府人民监察委员会发出处理通报，并把上述罪犯送交法院依法惩办。（江思）
