Are You Standing Over There or Coming Over Here?
　　Xie Juezai

　　The state apparatus of old China existed to suppress the people, allowing them to be exploited to the marrow of their bones, so as to provide for a life of licentiousness and shamelessness. In that kind of society, corruption was normal, and not being corrupt was an anomaly. In that kind of society, "one garment costs a thousand gold pieces, one meal costs a hundred gold pieces" was celebrated as a fine tale. In that kind of society, the more one was detached from the people, the more noble one appeared.

　　The people's revolution overthrew the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, allowing the people to manage their own affairs. The state organs took on a new appearance; every penny and every item was the property of the people, so how could corruption be tolerated? Every penny and every item had to be accumulated as capital for national industrialization, so how could waste be tolerated? The people's state cannot have organs that are opposed to the people, so how could bureaucraticism detached from the people be tolerated?

　　Revolution, an earth-shattering revolution, has forever buried the reactionary rule, and the filth and poison of corruption, waste, and bureaucraticism left behind by them must also be buried forever along with it. Protecting the motherland, abiding by the law, abiding by labor discipline, cherishing public property, a simple, honest, and people-serving style of work, must also be established along with it.

　　The remnants of the overthrown reactionary ruling class are not reconciled to their demise. The filth and poison they left behind still remain on some people. The bourgeoisie also wants to infiltrate the dark side of their nature—profiteering, wrongdoing, bribery, licentiousness, and other thoughts—into the revolutionary organization and corrode revolutionary personnel. This is another fierce battle following the war of guns and cannons. This fierce battle is unavoidable, but we must and will completely defeat it.

　　As early as September 29, 1949, Article 18 of the Common Program adopted by the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stated: "All state organs of the People's Republic of China must practice a revolutionary work style that is clean, simple, and serves the people, severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, and oppose bureaucraticism that is detached from the masses."

　　This is one side, that is the other side. This side is revolutionary and for the people; that side is counter-revolutionary and against the people. This side wants integrity, not corruption; wants simplicity, not waste; wants to serve the people, not be bureaucratic. The other side is exactly the opposite. The two sides are absolutely incompatible, with absolutely no room for compromise.

　　This is another serious test for revolutionary workers in thought and action. Will you stand on the side of the people and jointly severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, and oppose bureaucraticism? Or will you stand on the opposite side to be severely punished, prohibited, and opposed? In other words: Are you willing to wash away the dirt on your body and stand up easily? Or do you want to carry that dirty baggage and sink down shamefully? Of course, there is individual freedom, but time does not allow you to hesitate any longer.

    你站在那边呢还是站过这边来呢
  　谢觉哉
    旧中国的国家机构，为的是压制人民不许动，让他们敲骨吸髓，以供其荒淫无耻的生活。在那样的社会里，贪污是正常，不贪污是变态；在那样的社会里，“一衣千金，一食百金”传为佳话；在那样的社会里，越是脱离人民，就越显得高贵。
    人民革命，推翻了国民党反动派的统治，人民得以自己管理自己的事。国家机关显出新样；一钱一物都是人民的财产，那能容你贪污？一钱一物都要积累起来作为国家工业化的资本，那能容你浪费？人民的国家，不能有和人民对立的机关，那能容许有脱离人民的官僚主义？
    革命，天翻地复的革命，反动统治永远被埋葬了，他们遗下的贪污、浪费、官僚主义的污毒，也必然要随之永远埋葬。保护祖国、遵守法律、遵守劳动纪律、爱护公共财产、朴素的、廉洁的、为人民服务的作风，也必然随之建立。
    被推翻的反动统治阶级的残余分子还不甘心死亡，他们遗留下的污毒，还存留在一部分人的身上；资产阶级也想把他的黑暗的一面——惟利是图、为非作歹、行贿、荒淫等思想侵入到革命组织内部，侵蚀革命人员，这是继枪炮战争以后的又一场恶战。这一场恶战，是不可避免的，但我们须要彻底战胜也必能彻底战胜它的。
    早在一九四九年九月二十九日中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议通过的共同纲领第十八条，就写着：“中华人民共和国的一切国家机关，必须厉行廉洁的、朴素的、为人民服务的革命工作作风，严惩贪污，禁止浪费，反对脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风。”
    这是一边，那是一边。这边是革命的、人民的；那边是反革命的、反人民的。这边要廉洁，不要贪污；要朴素，不要浪费；要为人民服务，不要官僚主义。那边则恰恰相反。两下里是绝不相容，绝无可调协的余地的。
    这是革命工作人员在思想和行动上又一次严重的考验。站在人民一边共同来严惩贪污、禁止浪费、反对官僚主义呢？还是站在相反的一边来被严惩、被禁止、被反对呢？换句话说：你愿意把身上的肮脏洗掉，轻松地站起来？还是要背着那肮脏的包袱，可耻地沉下去？这当然有个人的自由，但时间已不允许你徘徊了。
