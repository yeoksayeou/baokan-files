    Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai People Joyfully Celebrate the Spring Festival
    State-Owned Trading Organizations Have Sufficient Goods, and the Market Remains Stable; All Public Places Are Packed; People Enjoy Themselves to the Fullest
    [Dispatch from this Newspaper] According to reports from special correspondents of this newspaper in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, the broad masses of people are celebrating this year's Spring Festival with extraordinary joy on the basis of the initial victory in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. In the capital, all government organs, schools, and factories have a four-day holiday. Workers, shop assistants, students, and public employees have been pouring into the streets and public places since Lunar New Year's Eve. Tickets for many cinemas and theaters were snapped up two days in advance. Before the main feature, all cinemas are showing current affairs newsreels on "Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy." The Summer Palace, the Western Suburban Park, Beihai Park, and Zhongshan Park are all open free of charge. The Beijing Laboring People's Cultural Palace held a grand ten-thousand-person dance party continuously. The People's Ice Rink held an ice sports meet. Prices remained stable throughout; thanks to the large supply of "New Year's goods" by state trading organizations and cooperatives, meat prices were 10% lower than before the Spring Festival. Major food stores were overcrowded, and the famous Daoxiangchun pastries were sold out on New Year's Eve. On New Year's Eve, the sound of firecrackers lasted all night. The streets of Tianjin were crowded with people, and many shops saw their business increase three to five times compared to weekdays, with all New Year's goods on the market being sold out. Except for New Year's goods, whose prices rose slightly due to increased sales, other commodity prices remained stable. Barber shops, bathhouses, and other businesses have changed their past bad habits and no longer increase prices during the Spring Festival. Citizens said, "This is also a benefit of the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement." The number of people wearing brand-new uniforms on the streets has increased, which is a symbol of full employment and changing customs. Male and female workers are going to public places in droves to enjoy themselves. Shanghai's market was widely praised during the Spring Festival as "business is booming, and prices are stable." Major department stores were packed. Thanks to the state-owned trading organizations' preparation of sufficient goods, prices have remained stable. Citizens are all talking about, "This year is really comfortable." Staff members of various government organs reveled to their heart's content on the 27th and 28th and, starting on the 29th, will throw themselves into the fierce anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement with a new fighting spirit.

    【本报讯】据北京、天津、上海等地本报特约记者报道，广大人民在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争初步胜利的基础上度过今年的春节，表现了分外的欢欣。首都各机关、学校、工厂放假四天，工人、店员、学生、公教人员从旧历除夕起，纷纷涌向街头和各公共场所。许多电影院和戏院每天的座券，在前两天就被抢购一空。各电影院在开演正片以前，都加映“反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义”的时事简报。颐和园、西郊公园、北海公园、中山公园等都免费开放。北京劳动人民文化宫连续举行盛大的万人舞会。人民溜冰场举行了冰上运动会。物价始终平稳；由于国家贸易机构和合作社大量供给“年货”，肉类价格比春节以前还要低百分之十。各大食品店拥挤不堪，有名的稻香春的点心，在除夕即被购买一空。除夕之夜，爆竹声通宵达旦。天津市街头人山人海，许多商店的生意比平日增加了三倍到五倍不等，市面上所有的年货都被买光了。除年货因销量增多，价格微升外，其他货价一直平稳。理发、澡堂等业，一改过去陋习，在春节不再增价。市民们说：“这也是反行贿、反偷税漏税运动的一个好处。”街头上穿崭新制服的人增多了，这是充分就业和移风易俗的象征。男女工人们纷纷结伴走进公共场所尽情地娱乐。上海的市场在春节中被普遍称赞为“生意兴隆，物价平稳”。各大百货公司被挤得水泄不通。由于国营贸易机构准备了充足的货物，使物价一直保持稳定。市民们都在谈论着：“今年过得真惬意”。各机关工作人员在二十七、二十八两日尽情狂欢，从二十九日起，将以新的战斗精神投入猛烈的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中去。
