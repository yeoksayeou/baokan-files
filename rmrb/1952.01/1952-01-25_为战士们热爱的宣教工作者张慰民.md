For Zhang Weimin, a Propaganda Worker Beloved by Soldiers

When the motherland launched the vigorous movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country, Comrade Zhang Weimin, in order to protect the happiness of millions of children, resolutely requested to leave her beloved motherland and volunteer to work in Korea on the fourteenth day after giving birth. From the Yalu River on the border of the motherland to south of the "38th Parallel" in Korea, she always marched on foot with the troops.

In May of last year, the Fifth Korean Campaign began. For work needs, the higher authorities assigned Comrade Zhang Weimin to serve as the deputy political instructor of a rear hospital in a certain area. This was during a rainy season in Korea, and she led a group of wounded soldiers across the treacherous Imjin River, passing through countless high mountains and narrow roads. Once, they crossed twenty-seven rivers and streams, large and small, in one day. When the hospital was short of food, Comrade Zhang Weimin climbed over two mountains to borrow food, solving the problem of food shortages for the wounded soldiers. Usually, she and her comrades always ate roasted flour and wild vegetables themselves, leaving the grain for the wounded soldiers. After such arduous struggles, they finally completed the twenty-one-day march and sent the wounded soldiers to a safe area.

One day in September last year, she was concentrating on formulating a political education plan for the cadre training class in a house and did not hear the air raid alarm. She was shot in the head by a bullet, but she continued to work before the wound had healed. Because she actively completed the troop's education plan and improved the political level of the cadres, she was awarded the third-class merit. This is how she worked day and night in Korea, her eyes were bloodshot, and her weight decreased, but she was always happily and tensely completing the tasks assigned to her by her superiors.

    为战士们热爱的宣教工作者张慰民
    当祖国掀起轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝保家卫国运动的时候，张慰民同志为了保卫千千万万孩子们的幸福，在她分娩后的第十四天，便坚决要求离开自己亲爱的祖国，志愿赴朝工作。从祖国的鸭绿江边到朝鲜的“三八线”以南，她始终随着部队徒步行军。
    去年五月，朝鲜第五次战役开始。为了工作需要，上级分配张慰民同志担任某地后方医院的副政治指导员。这正是朝鲜一个多雨的季节，她带领了一批伤员跨过险恶的临津江，经过了无数的高山窄路。有一次，他们曾在一天之内渡过二十七条大小河道。在医院缺粮时，张慰民同志曾翻过二座大山去借粮，解决伤员们的吃饭困难。平时，她和她的战友们总是自己吃着炒面、野菜，把粮食留给伤员们吃。经过这样艰苦的斗争，他们终于完成了二十一天的行军任务，把伤员们送到了安全地区。
    去年九月某一天，她正在房子里集中精力制订干部训练班的政治教育计划，没有听到敌机到来的警报，被子弹打伤了头部，可是她在伤口还没有痊愈的时候就继续工作了。由于她积极地完成了部队的教育计划，提高了干部的政治水平，被评上了三等功臣。她就是这样日日夜夜在朝鲜工作着，眼睛熬红了，体重减轻了，但是，她永远是愉快地、紧张地在完成上级交给她的任务。（附图片）
