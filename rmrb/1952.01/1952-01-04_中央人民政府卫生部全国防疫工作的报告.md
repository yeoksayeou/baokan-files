The national epidemic prevention work basically follows the general policy of "prevention first, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and uniting Chinese and Western medicine" in health work. It focuses on the twenty infectious diseases that pose the greatest threat to the people as prevention and control targets, and selects smallpox, plague, and cholera, which pose the greatest threat to national defense and economic construction, as key prevention and control targets. After twenty-one months of epidemic prevention work, several highly infectious diseases have been significantly reduced, and no major epidemics have occurred in disaster areas and among more than two million river management workers.

In order to prevent smallpox, which has been prevalent throughout the country for years, more than 200 million people have been vaccinated with cowpox in the past two years. In areas where vaccination has been conscientiously promoted, smallpox has generally been contained or reduced. For example, in cities such as Lushun, Dalian, Yingkou, Qinhuangdao, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Beijing, no cases of smallpox have been found since May of last year. In areas such as Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Pingyuan, Hebei, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Fujian, Tianjin, and Wuhan, the average number of smallpox cases this year has decreased by more than half compared to last year. In 1952, it is planned to vaccinate another 260 million people, striving to complete the nationwide universal vaccination program.

In the eight plague epidemic centers, plague prevention and control stations have been established, and the masses have been mobilized to catch rats and kill fleas, striving to detect patients early and carry out universal preventive injections. As a result, the plague epidemic was basically controlled in Inner Mongolia, Northeast China, and Chahar-Suiyuan (ChaSui) areas last year. In Inner Mongolia, the total number of cases throughout the year was only 22, equivalent to about 0.0013 of the incidence rate in 1949. From January to June this year, the number of plague cases nationwide was only 22.7% of the number of cases in the same period last year. This is due to the significant reduction in the number of cases in the three plague areas of Fujian, Guangdong, and Yunnan in the south, and no plague occurred in the epidemic areas of Zhejiang and Jiangxi this year. No plague has occurred in Chahar-Suiyuan for two years. The case fatality rate of plague patients nationwide has also decreased from 36.7% last year to 26% this year. This year, it is planned to further reduce the epidemic area and reduce the incidence rate in order to control the plague epidemic.

Cholera has been prevalent in China every year since it was introduced in 1820. The last major epidemic was in 1946. Some scholars in imperialist countries believe that cholera epidemics are cyclical, with a major epidemic occurring every three to five years. Because we have strengthened traffic quarantine to prevent the disease from entering from abroad; strengthened testing to detect patients early; carried out key drinking water disinfection and improved environmental hygiene to eliminate transmission routes; and carried out early preventive injections to enhance immunity, no true cholera patients have been found in the past three years. While preventing cholera, we have also achieved the effect of preventing typhoid and dysentery. In future work, in addition to strengthening preventive injections, we will further improve traffic quarantine, health testing, fecal treatment, and environmental hygiene, and vigorously carry out the movement to dig deep wells and protect water sources, in order to eradicate the occurrence of cholera and reduce the incidence of typhoid and dysentery.

The above is the prevention and control situation of several highly infectious diseases.

In terms of the prevention and control of chronic infectious diseases, we have done the following work: 1. Prevention and control of kala-azar, which is prevalent on both sides of the Yellow River and along the Longhai Railway. We have established eight professional prevention and control institutes and treated more than 110,000 patients in the past two years. This year, we also started to improve environmental sanitation, spraying domestically produced 666, reducing the breeding of sandflies that transmit the disease and killing dogs that transmit kala-azar, which has achieved the effect of reducing the number of patients in northern Jiangsu and other places. 2. In order to prevent and control Japanese schistosomiasis, 18 prevention and control stations and institutes have been established in the Yangtze River basin, and they are experimenting with capturing and killing the Oncomelania hupensis snails that transmit the disease, and promoting the three-jar method for storing feces in order to kill the eggs in the feces. 3. In order to prevent tuberculosis, 850,000 children in 82 cities have been vaccinated with BCG. 4. For the treatment of venereal diseases, in the three cities of Beijing, Suiyuan, and Xi'an, which have liberated prostitutes, venereal disease prevention and treatment has been carried out for the liberated prostitutes. In order to strengthen the prevention and control of venereal diseases in ethnic minority areas, the Inner Mongolia Health Department has begun to promote venereal disease prevention and control in each banner since last year, and in some banners, the effect of increasing the fertility rate has been achieved. The Seventh Detachment of the Central Epidemic Prevention Corps dispatched by the Central Health Department treated 120,000 venereal disease patients in the Tibetan and Mongolian areas of Gansu and Qinghai. In the past two years, the Medical College of Peking University has organized anti-syphilis teams consisting of professors and students during the summer vacation to go deep into the grasslands of Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia to assist in carrying out venereal disease prevention and control work.

Some preventive work has also been carried out for various infectious diseases in children; for example, in the past, measles had a high mortality rate due to the lack of nursing knowledge among many people. This year, publicity and prevention and control work have been strengthened, and the mortality rate has dropped from 8.5% last year to 5%.

In order to prevent typhus and relapsing fever, mass flea eradication campaigns have been promoted in disaster areas, the Huai River construction site, and the key transportation routes of national defense, curbing the epidemic of these two diseases.

In addition, regarding the prevention and control of malaria, we have not done enough in the past. From next year, it is planned to gradually establish malaria prevention stations in the three regions of Southwest China, Central South China, and East China to carry out malaria prevention work. For the prevention and control of epidemic encephalitis, it is planned to vigorously promote mosquito eradication campaigns in cities in North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China to curb its epidemic.

In order to ensure the supply of vaccines and serums in epidemic prevention work, six biological products institutes have been restored and expanded, and one new institute has been built in Central South China, and one new BCG laboratory has been built in Southwest China. The production volume of biological products has exceeded more than ten times that of the reactionary ruling period.

In the past year or so, due to the emphasis on prevention work and the reduction of disease epidemics, the population mortality rate due to epidemics has been greatly reduced, which has relatively increased the labor force in industry and agriculture and reduced unnecessary losses. This proves that the policy of prevention first is completely correct.

In order to summarize the work and deploy future work, a national epidemic prevention professional conference was held in April this year, which affirmed the main content of prevention work in the next few years; and affirmed that epidemic prevention work must combine technology with mass movements, must strengthen the education of epidemic prevention personnel on mass viewpoints; must strengthen publicity and education work for the masses, so that the masses consciously and willingly participate in the epidemic prevention movement. Only in this way can epidemic prevention work be universal and penetrate to the point where everyone knows it.

In order for epidemic prevention work to achieve the due effect, leading comrades at all levels of government must give appropriate attention. At present, some leading cadres of governments below the provincial and county levels only regard starvation as the responsibility of the government, and do not pay enough attention to death due to unsanitary conditions, thinking that it is a seemingly unavoidable "natural disaster," such as saying: "This is a spoon without a handle"; some also think that "see a doctor when you are sick, don't look for trouble if you are not sick." In fact, the number of people who die from epidemics far exceeds the number of people who die from starvation, and the causes of death are mostly preventable diseases. Due to insufficient understanding and insufficient attention to epidemic prevention work, and also due to insufficient reporting of work and reflection of situations by health personnel to higher levels, there is a lack of reports on health work in the work reports of local governments, making it difficult for the central government to grasp the situation in a timely manner. For example, last year, measles was epidemic in Yanggao County, Chahar Province, for four months, killing more than 1,000 children. Taoist societies and special agents took the opportunity to spread rumors. Leaders at the county and prefecture levels did not promptly report it to the higher levels. It was only after the political and legal committee sent a political construction team that discovered the masses' discouraged and panicked emotions that it was reflected to the province and the central government. Although the central government sent an epidemic prevention team to stop the epidemic, the masses thought: "The epidemic prevention team is good, but it came too late." Some local government agencies even sent some of the only health personnel to the countryside to do grain requisition and other work. Because grassroots health organizations have not been universally established, only by relying on local governments to pay more attention to epidemic prevention and health work can more results be achieved. It is hoped that the reports from the major administrative regions and provinces and cities to the central government can include a health work item, so that the central government can have more opportunities to understand the health status of the people, so as to facilitate the guidance of health work.

Although there have been some achievements in the 21 months of epidemic prevention work, there are still shortcomings, and the work is not comprehensive enough. For example, only some highly infectious diseases have been focused on, and other infectious diseases have been relaxed. Taking epidemic encephalitis as an example, because we did not learn the lessons of last year well, it is epidemic again this year in areas such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Northeast China. Malaria in the south is a major epidemic that threatens the health of the local people, and we have not done a good job of prevention and control. In terms of geography, we only paid attention to epidemic areas where diseases often occur, and neglected scattered areas where diseases do not often occur. Secondly, we have not done enough and not universally enough in making epidemic prevention work a broader mass movement. Although we have adopted the method of uniting new, old, middle-aged, Chinese, and Western medical personnel to participate in epidemic prevention work, and encouraged doctors to go to the countryside, some senior health personnel have responded to the call in the past two years. However, the mobilization work in large cities has not been done enough, so the strength feels weak. In addition, we have not done enough to change the old medical view of emphasizing treatment and neglecting prevention. Some health leading cadres have shown weakness and procrastination in the work of reversing this direction. These shortcomings should be overcome in the future in order to further improve the people's healthy life.

    中央人民政府卫生部全国防疫工作的报告
    （一九五一年十月十九日李德全部长在政务院第一百零七次政务会议上的报告，并经同次会议批准）
    全国的防疫工作，基本上是遵循着卫生工作的“预防为主，面向工农兵，团结中西医”的总方针，针对危害人民最大的二十种传染病作为防治目标，又选择其中威胁国防与经济建设最大的天花、鼠疫、霍乱作为重点防治目标而进行的。经过二十一个月的防疫工作，有几种烈性传染病，已显著的减少，并使灾区及二百余万治河民工中没有发生大的流行病。
    为了预防历来常年流行于全国各地的天花，两年来已在二亿余人口中种了牛痘。凡是认真推行种痘的地区天花一般是遏制了或减少了。如旅大、营口、秦皇岛、厦门、广州、北京等城市自去年五月以来没有发现过天花，如东北、内蒙、平原、河北、江西、陕西、福建、天津、武汉等地，今年天花发病人数平均约较去年减少了一半以上；一九五二年计划再增加种痘两亿六千余万人，争取完成全国普种牛痘的工作。
    在八个鼠疫流行中心地区，均设了鼠疫防治所，发动了群众捕鼠、灭蚤，争取能早期发现病人，并进行普遍的预防注射。因之去年在内蒙、东北、察蒙地区基本上控制了鼠疫的流行。内蒙去年全年发病数只二十二人，约合一九四九年发病率的千分之一点三。今年一至六月全国鼠疫发病人数，仅为去年同期发病人数百分之二十二点七。这是由于南方的福建、广东、云南三个鼠疫地区，发病人数大大减少了，而浙江及江西的疫区，今年亦未发生鼠疫。察蒙已两年未发生鼠疫。今年全国鼠疫病人的病死率也由去年的百分之三六点七，减至百分之二六。今年计划进一步缩小疫区、减低发病率，以期控制鼠疫的流行。
    霍乱自一八二○年传入中国后，历年均有流行，最后一次大流行是一九四六年，帝国主义国家某些学者并认为霍乱流行是有周期性的，三、五年必大流行一次。由于我们加强了交通检疫以防该病从国外传入；加强检验以求早期发现病人；有重点地进行饮水消毒，及改进环境卫生，以杜绝传染途径并进行早期预防注射，以增强免疫力；三年来未曾发现一个真性霍乱病人，在预防霍乱的同时，也收到预防伤寒与痢疾的效果。今后工作除加强预防注射外，将进一步从改进交通检疫。卫生检验、粪便处理、环境卫生工作着手，并大力开展开凿深井及保护水源运动，以期根绝霍乱的发生及减少伤寒、痢疾的发病。
    上面是几种烈性传染病的防治情况。
    在慢性传染病的防治方面，我们做了如下一些工作：一、对流行于黄河两岸，陇海铁路沿线的黑热病的防治。我们已建立了八个专业防治所，两年来治愈十一万余病人。今年并开始了改善环境卫生，喷射国产六六六，减少了该病传染媒介白蛉子的繁殖并捕杀了传染黑热病的狗，在苏北等地收到了减少病人的效果。二、为了防治日本住血吸虫病，在长江流域成立了十八个防治站、所，正实验捕杀传染该病的钉螺，并为杀灭粪便中的虫卵，提倡三缸贮粪法。三、为了预防结核病，在八十二个城市的儿童中，已接种卡介苗计八十五万人。四、对性病的治疗，在北京、绥远、西安等三个已解放娼妓的城市中，为已解放了的妓女进行了性病防治。为了加强少数民族地区的性病防治工作，内蒙卫生部自去年起开始推行了逐旗的性病防治，在某些旗，已收到生育率上升的效果。中央卫生部派遣了中央防疫总队第七大队在甘肃、青海的藏、蒙族居住地区，治疗了十二万性病病人。北京大学医学院两年来均在暑期，由教授学生组织了抗梅队，深入绥蒙、内蒙草原，协助开展性病防治工作。
    对小儿各种传染病，也进行了一些预防工作；如麻疹过去由于许多群众缺乏护理知识，病死率很高，今年加强了宣传及防治工作，病死率由去年的百分之八·五，降到百分之五。
    为预防斑疹伤寒、回归热，在灾区、治淮工地、国防的交通要道，重点地推行了群众性的灭蚤运动，遏止了这两种疾病的流行。
    此外，如关于疟疾的防治，过去做得还不够，明年起拟在西南、中南、华东三区逐步做到普遍设立防疟站，开展防疟工作，对于流行性脑炎的防治，拟在华北、东北、西北等地城市中，大力推行灭蚊运动，以遏制其流行。
    为了保证防疫工作中的疫苗、血清的供应，恢复与扩大了六个生物制品所，并在中南区新建一所，西南区新建卡介苗实验所一所。生物制品的生产量较反动统治时期超过了十倍以上。
    一年多以来，由于注重预防工作，减少了疾病的流行，因而使因疫病而死亡的人口大为减少，也就相对增加了工业农业的劳动力，减少了不必要的损失。这证明了预防为主的方针是完全正确的。
    为了总结工作并布置今后工作，今年四月间曾召开了全国防疫专业会议，肯定了在今后数年内预防工作的主要内容；并肯定防疫工作，必须使技术与群众运动相结合，必须加强防疫人员的群众观点的教育；必须加强对群众宣传教育工作，使群众自觉自愿地参加防疫运动。只有这样，才能使防疫工作普遍和深入到家喻户晓的程度。
    要使防疫工作收到应有的效果，必须各级政府领导同志给予适当的重视。现在有些省县以下的政府领导干部，只把饿死人认为是政府的责任，对于因不卫生而病死人，则重视不够，认为是似乎难以避免的“天灾”，如说：“这是没有把子的勺子”；也有认为“有病再请医生看，没有病不要找麻烦”。其实因疫病而死的人数，远超过饿死的，而致死的原因大都是可以预防的疾病。由于对防疫工作的了解不够，重视不足，也由于卫生人员向上级报告工作和反映情况不够，所以在各地政府工作报告中缺乏有关卫生工作的报告，使中央难于及时掌握情况。如去年察哈尔阳高县麻疹流行已四个月，死了
    一千多个小孩，道会门、特务更借此造谣活动，县及专署各级领导并未迅即上报，还是政法委员会派去的建政小组发现了群众灰心与恐慌的情绪，才反映到省及中央来。虽经中央派防疫队去制止了疫情，群众认为：“防疫队好，可是来的太晚了”。有些地方政府机关并把仅有的一些卫生人员派下乡去作征粮等工作，由于卫生基层组织尚未普遍的建立起来，只有依靠地方政府更多的重视防疫卫生工作才能收到较多的成效。希望各大行政区及省市给中央的报告内，能有卫生工作一项，使中央能有更多机会了解人民健康状况，以便于指导卫生工作。
    二十一个月的防疫工作，虽然有些成绩，但仍有缺点，工作也不够全面。比如只抓着了一些烈性传染病作重点，对其他传染病放松了。就以流行性脑炎来说，因为没有很好的接受去年的教训，致今年又在北京、天津、东北等地区流行。南方的疟疾，是威胁当地人民健康很大的流行病，我们还没有很好地作起防治工作来。就地域上说，只注意了常发病的疫区，忽视了散在的不常发病的地区。其次，在使防疫工作更成为广大的群众运动这一点，做得还不够、不普遍，我们虽采取了团结新、老、中、西各部门的医务人员来参加防疫工作，并鼓励医生下乡，两年来也有一些高级卫生人员，响应了号召。但在大城市中动员工作还作的不够，因此力量也就感到薄弱。此外，对于改变重治疗轻预防的旧医学的观点，也还作得不够，有些卫生领导干部，在扭转这个方向的工作中，表现了软弱无力，并有些拖延。这些缺点，今后应予以克服，以求更进一步改善人民的健康生活。
