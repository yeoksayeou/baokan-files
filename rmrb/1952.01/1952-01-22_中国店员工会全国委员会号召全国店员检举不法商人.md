Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: A letter from the All-China Federation of Shop Employees on mobilizing shop employees nationwide to actively participate in exposing illegal businessmen.
    Comrades of shop employees throughout the country:

    Since Chairman Mao called for a vigorous and swift launch of the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, shop employees in various regions have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call, bravely revealing and boldly exposing the bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy work and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence committed by those illegal businessmen. In this struggle, the vast majority of shop employees, in the posture of masters of the country, have demonstrated the true qualities of the working class, and many model figures have emerged. Here, the National Committee extends warm congratulations and high respect to the comrades who are standing on the front lines of this struggle, waging a heroic fight against those illegal businessmen and achieving victory!

    Comrades of shop employees throughout the country: We must recognize that the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy and the exposure of illegal businessmen is a serious class struggle, and our shop employees bear a particularly important responsibility in the struggle to expose illegal businessmen. Now we are already engaged in a face-to-face struggle with those illegal businessmen. Those who refuse to confess and repent are concentrating their efforts to counterattack us, using intimidation and bribery to obstruct our exposure of their illegal activities. They use conspiracies such as dismissal, store closures, withholding wages, and false accusations to threaten us, and use petty favors to drag us down. This behavior of the bourgeoisie is despicable and shameless, and these methods are insidious and vicious. We must be vigilant and not be fooled. Even if we have taken a little advantage in the past, receiving 30,000, 50,000, 100,000, or 80,000, it is nothing more than them scraping a large amount of wealth from our people, giving us some skin and bones to make us bear the blame together. It is definitely not out of good intentions!

    Comrades of shop employees throughout the country, we must stand firm on the position of our working class, not stand idly by, not listen to rumors, not fear threats, not be tempted by bribes. Those who have taken some small advantages in the past should first bravely confess and "take a bath," and no longer cover up for them, making mistake after mistake, being used by those illegal businessmen, and ruining their bright future. Every one of our shop employee comrades must be a heroic warrior in the struggle against illegal businessmen, and must not be defeated by sugar-coated bullets and become their prisoners!

    Comrades of shop employees throughout the country, with Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the broad masses supporting us and standing up for us, the final victory will surely be ours.

    With class struggle salute!

    All-China Federation of Shop Employees

    中国店员工会全国委员会号召全国店员检举不法商人
    【新华社二十一日讯】中国店员工会全国委员会关于动员全国店员积极参加检举不法商人的一封信。全国店员同志们：
    自从毛主席号召大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的伟大斗争以来，各地店员同志们即热烈地响应了毛主席的号召，勇敢地揭发，大胆地检举那些不法商人的行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报等犯罪行为。在这个斗争中，最大多数的店员同志，都是以国家主人翁的姿态，表现出了工人阶级的本色，并有不少的模范人物出现。在这里，全国委员会要向站在这个斗争的最前线上，对那些不法商人进行英勇斗争并获得了胜利的同志们致热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意！
    全国店员同志们：我们必须认识反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义和检举不法商人是一场严重的阶级斗争，而我们店员在检举不法商人的斗争中是负有特别重要的责任。现在我们已经与那些不法商人面对面地进行斗争了，那些不肯坦白悔过的不法商人，也正在集中力量向我们反扑，用威吓利诱的手段，阻挠我们对他们那些不法行为的检举。他们用解雇、关店、不发工资、诬告等阴谋手段来威胁我们，用小恩小惠的办法来拖我们下水。资产阶级的这种行为是卑鄙无耻的，这种手段是阴险毒辣的。我们要提高警惕，不要上当。就是过去我们占过一点小便宜，分过三万、五万、十万、八万的人，那也不过是人家从我们人民身上刮去大批民脂民膏，给我们一些肉皮和骨头来使得我们一起背上罪名罢了，决不是什么善心好意！
    全国店员同志们，我们要站稳我们工人阶级的立场，不要袖手旁观，不要听信谣言，不怕威胁，不受利诱，凡是过去占过一些小便宜的人，首先要自己勇敢地坦白“洗澡”，不要再替他们打掩护，一错再错，被那些不法商人所利用，葬送了自己的光明前途。我们每一个店员同志在与不法商人进行斗争时，都要作英勇的战士，千万不要被那些糖衣裹着的炮弹所打倒，当了他们的俘虏！
    全国店员同志们，有毛主席、共产党、人民政府和广大群众给我们撑腰作主，最后胜利一定是我们的。此致阶级斗争的敬礼！
              中国店员工会全国委员会
                          一月十八日
