    On Organizing Party and Soviet Staff to Give Political Reports to Rural Residents
    Editor's Note: This article is from the book "Resolutions and Documents on Propaganda and Agitation of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)." The shortcomings pointed out in this article regarding the work of delivering political reports to rural residents are precisely the shortcomings that exist in this area today. The methods proposed in the article to overcome these shortcomings are also suitable for our current situation. Currently, some reporters have gone deep into the countryside to give political reports to farmers; however, reporters in many places have not yet done so. Reporters in these places should, in the future, carefully give political reports to farmers based on the specific local conditions, referring to the methods proposed in this article. Recently, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) passed a resolution on organizing Party and Soviet staff to give political reports to residents. The resolution stated: Based on the inspection conducted by the Central Propaganda and Agitation Department, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) believes that the work of telling residents in many rural areas about the situation on the front lines of the Patriotic War, the domestic economic and political life, and the international situation of the Soviet Union is not being done satisfactorily. The Party and Soviet leading staff in these areas do not give political reports to male and female collective farm members, and do not explain current events to them; the District Committees of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) do not absorb rural intellectuals to give reports and conduct talks.

    The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) believes that this kind of unauthorized political work among residents by some of our cadres is intolerable. At the same time, it attaches great importance to the Party and Soviet leading staff giving political reports in the countryside. Therefore, it instructed all District Committees, State Committees, Border Committees, and Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to convene a general meeting of collective farm members in each collective farm at least once every month to a month and a half to report or talk about current military and political events. The speakers should be: Secretaries and members of the District Committees, State Committees, and Border Committees of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), chairmen of the Executive Committees of the District, State, and Border Soviets of Working People's Deputies, secretaries of the District and State Committees of the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League, and other leading staff of the Party, Communist Youth League, and Soviet organizations. The District Committees of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) have the responsibility to absorb the most cultivated part of rural intellectuals to give political reports and talks in collective farms.

    In order to make district staff aware of the current situation, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) suggested that skilled reporters be sent from the centers of the border regions and states to rural areas at least once a month. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) instructed that consultant groups be organized in the Party data rooms for Party, Communist Youth League, and Soviet staff who give political reports in the countryside, and that they be regularly assisted in preparing reports.

    关于组织党和苏维埃工作人员向农村居民作政治报告
    编者按：本文是“联共（布）关于宣传鼓动的决议和文件”一书中的一篇。本文所指出的向农村居民作政治报告这一工作中的缺点，也正是我们当前在这一方面所存在的缺点。文中所提出的克服这些缺点的办法，也是适合于我们当前的情况的。目前我们已经有些报告员深入农村，向农民作政治报告；但是许多地方的报告员还没有这样作。这些地方的报告员，今后应该根据当地的具体情况，参照本文所提出的方法，认真向农民作政治报告。最近联共（布）中央通过了关于组织党和苏维埃工作人员向居民作政治报告的决议。决议中说道：联共（布）中央根据中央宣传鼓动部所进行的检查，认定在许多农村区域里向居民讲述祖国战争前线情况、讲述国内经济和政治生活情况、以及讲述苏联国际形势的工作是做得不能令人满意的。这些区域的党和苏维埃领导工作人员不在男女集体农庄庄员面前做政治报告，不向他们解释目前的事变；联共（布）区委不吸收农村知识分子做报告和进行谈话。
    联共（布）中央认为我们的一部分干部这种擅自不在居民中间进行政治工作是不能容忍的，同时极其重视党和苏维埃领导工作人员在农村中作政治报告，于是责成联共（布）所有的区委、州委、边委以及加盟共和国共产党中央，在每个集体农庄里，至少一个月到一个半月要召集一次集体农庄庄员大会进行关于当前军事和政治事变的报告或谈话。做报告的人应当是：联共（布）区委、州委、边委书记和委员，区、州、边区劳动人民代表苏维埃执行委员会主席，苏联列宁主义青年团区、州委员会书记，以及党、共青团和苏维埃组织的其他领导工作人员。联共（布）区委有责任吸收农村知识分子中最有修养的一部分在集体农庄中作政治报告和谈话。
    为了使区工作人员知晓当前的形势，联共（布）中央建议从边区和州的中心派遣熟练的报告人员到农村区域去，至少每月一次。联共（布）中央责成在党资料室内为在农村作政治报告的党、共青团和苏维埃工作人员组织顾问团并经常帮助他们准备报告。  （葆华、岸青译）
