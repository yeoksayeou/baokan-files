Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 11th: At the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on January 11th, our side continued to refute the other side's unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs by restricting airport equipment in North Korea. Our representative pointed out: "Our side will never allow interference in our internal affairs in any form to be included in any agreement currently under negotiation. Regarding whether or not our side constructs any kind of facility during the war or during the armistice, our side has the full right to choose according to its own needs. This is entirely a matter of our internal affairs and does not allow your side to interfere."

At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, our representative summarized the results of the subcommittee over the past month, pointing out that the subcommittee has not made any progress to date due to the other side's use of various pretexts in an attempt to detain our captured personnel. From the first day of the subcommittee meeting, our side proposed that both sides promptly release and repatriate all prisoners of war after the cessation of hostilities. However, the other side put forward a so-called prerequisite for discussing the agenda item, requesting that the International Committee of the Red Cross be allowed to visit the prisoner-of-war camps first and that prisoner-of-war information be exchanged, refusing to discuss our completely fair and reasonable proposal. Although there should not be any prerequisites for discussing our proposal, nor is any information needed, in order to make progress in the meeting and to remove all of the other side's pretexts, our side agreed to exchange prisoner-of-war information first and submitted to the other side on December 18th of last year full and complete information on all of their captured personnel. However, the list of our captured personnel submitted by the other side only included names spelled in English, and not only did the total number not match the actual number of names, with 1,456 people missing, but it also did not include the whereabouts of 44,205 of our personnel. Not only did the other side adopt this extremely irresponsible attitude, but it even proposed a so-called "one-for-one exchange" method, openly attempting to detain our captured personnel as hostages. Furthermore, under the pretext of so-called "voluntary repatriation," it conspired to send our captured personnel to the Lee-Chiang bandit gangs. Our side has clearly stated that all displaced civilians on the other side will be repatriated to their homes after the armistice, but the other side actually demanded a one-for-one exchange of our captured personnel for displaced civilians. Our representative pointed out that the other side's absurd and unreasonable demand to detain our captured personnel has prevented all progress in the meeting for a month. Unless the other side completely abandons this unreasonable demand, the meeting will not be able to make any progress.

    朝鲜谈判第三、第四两项议程小组委员会上
    我方继续驳斥美方无理要求
    【新华社开城十一日电】一月十一日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表继续驳斥对方所提出的干涉我方内政的限制朝鲜境内机场设备的无理要求。我方代表指出：“我方决不容许将在任何形式下的对我方内政的干涉包括在目前谈判的任何协议内。关于战争期间或停战期间我方进行或不进行任何一种设备，我方有充分的权利根据自身的需要，自行选择，这完全是我方的内政问题，不容许你方过问。”
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表总结小组委员会一个月以来的结果，指出由于对方使用各种藉口，企图扣留我方被俘人员，小组委员会至今未能获得任何进展。自从小组会议的第一天起，我方就提出了敌对行为终止后，双方迅速释放与遣送全体战俘的提案。但对方却提出了所谓讨论议程本题前的先决条件，要求首先允许红十字国际委员会访问俘虏营，以及交换战俘资料，拒绝讨论我方所提出的完全公平合理的提案。虽然讨论我方的这一提案根本不应该有任何的先决条件，也不需要任何的资料，但为了获得会议的进展，为了解除对方的一切藉口，我方同意首先交换战俘资料，并在去年十二月十八日以充分完整的对方全部被俘人员的资料提交对方。而对方所交来的我方被俘人员的名单，却只包括了英文拼写的姓名，不但总数与姓名实数不合，缺少一千四百五十六人之多，而且更未包括四万四千二百零五名我方人员的下落。对方不仅采取了这种极端不负责任的态度，而且竟提出所谓“一对一交换”的办法，公然企图扣留我方被俘人员作为人质。更以所谓“自愿遣送”为藉口，阴谋将我方被俘人员送交李蒋匪帮。我方已经明确声明，停战后遣送对方所有流离失所的平民归返家园，但对方竟要求以我方被俘人员与流离失所的平民进行一对一的交易。我方代表指出对方扣留我方被俘人员的荒谬无理的要求，已经在一个月以来阻止了会议的一切的进展。除非对方彻底放弃这一无理要求，会议也将不可能有任何进展。
