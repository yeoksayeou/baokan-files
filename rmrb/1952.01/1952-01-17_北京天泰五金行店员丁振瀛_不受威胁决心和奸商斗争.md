    Editor: I am a shop assistant at the Tiantai Hardware Store in Beijing and was elected as a trade union committee member in 1950. Last May, the capitalist of our store evaded taxes and falsified accounts. After these crimes were exposed, the manager, Zhao Jichuan, was punished. As a result, Zhao regarded me as a thorn in his side. One day, when I went out to attend a meeting, he summoned all the counter staff and said, "No one is to pay attention to Ding Zhenying! Work or don't work, as you please!" After the government called on all sectors to launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, I actively participated. Manager Zhao, seeing that the situation was not good for him, immediately looked for my introducer and had him in turn find my uncle to undermine me. My uncle said to me, "No one else in the store is doing it, so why are you!" He wanted me to go home and farm. I didn't care about any of this and continued to mobilize the masses to make accusations. Manager Zhao, again through the introducer, instigated my uncle to find my father. When my father came, he said to me, "Your grandfather is ill, hurry home." I knew this was a trick played by the manager and I must not fall for it. My father then said, "The union doesn't feed you either; if you mess things up, you'll still have to go home, and you'll bring shame to the family!" At that time, I said, "Do you want your son to progress, or to lag behind?" My father had nothing to say and had to go home. Everyone, think about it, the crooked merchant is using all means to get rid of the trade union cadre. This is something that deserves great vigilance! I hope that workers and shop assistants will not be deceived by the crooked merchants and resolutely fight the bribing merchants to the end! Ding Zhenying

    北京天泰五金行店员丁振瀛  不受威胁决心和奸商斗争
    编辑同志：我是北京市天泰五金行的店员，在一九五○年被选为工会委员。去年五月，我店资方偷税、漏税并伪造账目。这些罪行经人揭发了，经理赵济川受到了惩罚。于是，赵把我看成了眼中钉。有一天，当我出去开会时，他召集全柜人员说：“谁也别理丁振瀛，你们爱干活不干！”自政府号召各界展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动后，我积极参加了。赵经理一看势头不好，立刻找我的介绍人，让他再找我的舅舅，拉我的后腿。舅舅对我说：“人家柜上的人都不搞，怎么你就搞啦！”他要我回家种地去。我不管这些，仍发动群众作检举工作。赵经理又经过介绍人，策动我舅舅去找我父亲。父亲来了，对我说：“你祖父病了，赶快回家去。”我知道这是经理玩的手腕，绝不能上圈套。父亲又说：“工会也不管你饭，搞坏了，你还得回家，你能给家里丢人吗？”当时我说：“你愿意你的儿子进步，还是愿意落伍？”父亲无话可说，只好回家。大家想想，奸商用尽一切方法要把工会干部弄下去，这是多么值得警惕的事！我希望工人、店员们切不要受奸商的欺骗，坚决地和行贿奸商斗争到底！  丁振瀛
