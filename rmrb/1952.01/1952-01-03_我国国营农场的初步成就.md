The state-owned farms in our country are agricultural enterprises of a socialist nature. Its basic characteristic is the use of mechanized farming on large tracts of state-owned land, and all employees of the farm carry out collective labor as masters of the country to complete the production tasks assigned by the state. Since the founding of New China, under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, the cause of state-owned farms has gradually developed. The farms have taken initial shape and made some achievements.

Currently, the larger state-owned farms, apart from the Northeast region, include ten in North China, three in East China, one in Central South China, and one in Northwest China. These fifteen state-owned farms have a total cultivated area of ​​more than 555,000 mu, and more than 4,200 employees. In 1950, the sown area was more than 161,000 mu, and the harvest of agricultural products was equivalent to more than 15.6 million jin of millet. In 1951, the sown area was more than 165,000 mu, and the harvest of agricultural products was equivalent to more than 24.78 million jin of millet. These farms all have sufficient tractors, combine harvesters, and other various agricultural machinery and tools.

Among these state-owned farms, Lutai Farm is relatively large in scale and well-equipped. Its total area is more than 52,000 mu. Except for the area occupied by roads, ditches, and buildings, the cultivated area of ​​the farm is more than 44,400 mu. Water conservancy projects have been constructed throughout the farm, and electricity is used to pump water for irrigation. The experimental farm of the Ministry of Agriculture’s Mechanized Farming School of the Central People's Government has a total area of ​​only more than 2,700 mu. Except for the area occupied by roads and buildings, the cultivated area is more than 2,100 mu. Although this farm has a small area, it is relatively advanced among the state-owned farms.

Most of these state-owned farms were established in sparsely populated areas, long-barren land, or land with high salinity. Of the more than 160,000 mu of sown area on the farms within the customs (关内), except for about 10,000 mu of cultivated land, all were newly reclaimed wasteland. Many farms have gone through a fairly arduous construction process. For example, the state-owned Lutai Farm was originally a farm established by the Japanese invaders during the Japanese puppet regime in order to exploit Chinese farmers. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the houses, water conservancy facilities, etc. in the farm were destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits, and the land was abandoned. When the People's Government carried out restoration work in April 1949, the farm was overgrown with weeds and desolate. In early August of that year, it rained continuously, and the Jiyun River rose sharply, and the farm was flooded. However, under the leadership of the farm manager, all the employees of the farm, on the one hand, risked danger to plug the breaches and drain the accumulated water, and on the other hand, insisted on the reconstruction work. After a year of hard struggle, the farm was formally established in May 1950. So far, the farm has built more than 300 houses, more than 130 tractor rooms and warehouses, etc., and the entire farm has been equipped with electric lights. In terms of water conservancy, the entire water conservancy system of the farm has been sorted out, with a total of 80 bridges, 887 gate valves, 136,800 cubic meters of channel and flood control projects, 29,247 cubic meters of road projects, and 2 pumping stations built, so that 80% of the farm's land can be irrigated with water. Another example is the Dongxin Farm in northern Jiangsu. In the early days of its establishment, it was a large area of ​​saline-alkali land that had been barren for more than a hundred years, almost uninhabited, and full of reeds. After hard work, all the employees finally reclaimed 16,900 mu of cultivated land. This farm is also of considerable size.

Although most of the cultivated land of state-owned farms is newly reclaimed wasteland and saline-alkali land, after two years of operation, most of these lands have gradually become fertile fields, and the yield of crops has gradually increased. Judging from the agricultural production of various farms within the customs in 1951, the total planting area of ​​the fifteen state-owned farms increased by only 31.5% compared with 1950, but the total output increased by 58% compared with 1950, and the average yield per mu increased by 38% compared with 1950. Looking at several major crops: cotton had a harvested area of ​​15,791 mu in 1950, with an average yield of 99.9 jin per mu; in 1951, the harvested area was 14,679 mu, with an average yield of 150.7 jin per mu, an increase of 50.8% compared with 1950. Rice had a harvested area of ​​17,630 mu in 1950, with an average yield of 418 jin per mu; in 1951, the harvested area was 19,846 mu, with an average yield of 470 jin per mu, an increase of 12.4% compared with 1950. Wheat had a harvested area of ​​22,492 mu in 1950, with an average yield of only 49.5 jin per mu; in 1951, the harvested area was 38,614 mu, with an average yield of 113.5 jin per mu, an increase of 129% compared with 1950.

The achievements made by state-owned farms in production in the past two years are not only in terms of increased production. The increase in production in 1951 was just a beginning. The main achievement is that some farms have begun to master the advanced Soviet production technology and management methods.

In terms of agricultural technology: In 1951, the tendency of only paying attention to expanding the area of ​​reclamation while ignoring the quality of cultivation in 1950 was basically reversed. For example, on the issue of deep plowing, from 1949 to the spring of 1950, the deepest plowing was only 15 centimeters. In 1951, various farms not only demanded improved efficiency, but also proposed quality standards. Currently, the general plowing depth has reached more than 20 centimeters (approximately 7 inches), which will play a decisive role in increasing agricultural production.

The most important gains in agricultural technology are that cotton close planting and dry direct seeding of rice have been effective.

Appropriate close planting is a decisive factor for increasing cotton production, and it is an advanced Soviet experience. However, Chinese farmers used to plant cotton sparsely, and the various farms were no exception. When the experimental farm of the Mechanized Farming School was first established in 1949, 1,500 plants were planted per mu, and as a result, only 48 jin of seed cotton were harvested per mu. In the second year, under the guidance of Soviet experts, the experiment of close planting began, with 2,500 plants planted per mu, and as a result, 163 jin of seed cotton were harvested per mu. In 1951, 3,600 plants were planted per mu, and a series of field management tasks such as fertilization, inter-tillage, pest control, and pruning were carried out. As a result, the average yield per mu on 944 mu of dry land reached 296 jin of seed cotton; 7.5 mu of high-yield cotton fields harvested 537 jin per mu; and the task was over-fulfilled ahead of schedule (the original plan was for an average yield of 250 jin per mu for general cotton fields and 500 jin per mu for high-yield areas). This successful experience of close planting, if widely promoted in the large areas of land of various farms and among farmers, cotton production can be greatly increased. For example, after the close planting of cotton by the experimental farm of the Mechanized Farming School increased production, it had a demonstration effect on nearby farmers. Farmers in Guojiaying Village initially learned close planting in 1951, and the yield increased from 80 jin of seed cotton per mu in 1950 to 106 jin.

Dry direct seeding of rice is also an advanced Soviet experience. In large state-owned farms, manual transplanting of rice seedlings is a big problem. The state-owned Lutai Farm absorbed the advanced agricultural experience of the Soviet Union and used machinery to try dry direct seeding in 1950, and the use of a widening seeder was successful. The method is to prepare the land before sowing, and then use a seeder to directly sow the rice seeds into the ground, and then properly water it. When sowing, the widening seeder is installed on the furrow opener of the seeder, which can adjust the sowing depth and increase the density of the rice. Using this method of dry direct seeding, an 80-horsepower tractor, connected to four seeders, with eight workers, can sow 45 mu per hour, which is 15 to 20 times more efficient than manual transplanting.

In terms of machinery: Currently, tractor drivers or repair personnel of various farms have mastered the complete set of technologies from driving, operating, maintaining, to repairing agricultural machinery and tools such as tractors and combine harvesters. In 1951, machinery failures in various farms were greatly reduced. The most important thing is that in 1951, from plowing to harvesting, the most advanced method of combined operation was used, thereby improving work efficiency and saving a lot of fuel. For example, when some farms sow spring wheat, harrowing can be connected to four Soviet-style disc harrows or six American-style disc harrows. One tractor power and three workers can harrow 60 to 90 mu per hour on average, and the fuel consumption per mu is 0.15 to 0.25 kg. Seeders can be connected to four units for use. One tractor power and eight workers can sow 50 to 60 mu per hour, and the fuel consumption per mu is 0.15 to 0.3 kg. In 1951, two "Stalin No. 6" combine harvesters were used to harvest wheat in combination, averaging 22 mu per hour, an increase of 5.25 mu compared with 1950; the fuel consumption was also reduced to 0.73 kg per mu, saving 0.61 kg compared with 1950. (In the Soviet Union, using two combine harvesters to harvest in combination, the average harvest is 24 mu per hour, and the fuel consumption per mu is 0.65 kg.)

In terms of management: The management policy has gradually become clear, which is to seriously study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In terms of organizational structure, since 1951, the institutionalized institutions have been changed to the organizational form of production teams. At the same time, a dedicated responsibility system has been established, such as the land contracting and vehicle contracting system in machinery; and the zone division and land division system in agriculture, which laid the foundation for the enterprise of agricultural management. In terms of democratic management, the general leading cadres have realized in the production practice over the past few years that the production plan of state-owned farms must rely on workers to be implemented. Therefore, the view of relying on workers to run the farm well has begun to be established. At present, most farms have established farm management committees and trade union organizations. The members of the trade unions of various farms account for an average of more than 85% of the total number of employees of various farms. The trade unions of most farms have played a certain role in organizing and educating workers to complete production tasks and handling employee welfare matters. In terms of planning and statistics, since 1951, various farms have begun to formulate production plans and financial plans. Some farms have compiled cost plans in conjunction with production. Some farms have formulated unified labor allocation plans or livestock feed planting plans. Some farms have initially formulated consumption quota plans. Most state-owned farms have equipped statistical staff in the mechanized farming team and the accounting office. For example, Lutai Farm and the experimental farm of the Mechanized Farming School have established relatively complete daily report forms, and at the same time, they have achieved field records and statistics of workload. In terms of economic accounting, various farms have all kept accounts and made forms in accordance with the unified system issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, so they have been able to reflect the financial situation in the production process; some farms have also tried to statistically count and record the consumption of manpower and materials and the labor point system in operations.

Due to the gradual improvement of management work, especially the widespread establishment of trade unions and democratic management committees in various farms, the political awareness and labor enthusiasm of employees have been significantly improved. In 1951, various farms generally carried out patriotic bumper harvest competition campaigns, and many new records emerged. For example, when the workers of the Yellow River Flood Area Farm were adding seeds to the sowing boxes during sowing, they did not master the method at first, and it took 16 to 18 minutes to fill the seeds for three seeders. In the competition, everyone tried to improve the method, and as a result, it only took 2 to 3 minutes to load a batch of seeds, which increased the work efficiency by 5 to 8 times. During autumn sowing, using a "Nachi" tractor connected to three seeders for sowing, a new record of sowing 70.2 mu to 89.16 mu per hour was created, and the task of sowing 45,000 mu of wheat was successfully completed.

However, there are still many shortcomings in state-owned farms: First, most farms were established on land that had been abandoned for many years. Up to now, the problems of drainage and irrigation projects and the elimination of alkali and grass damage have not been well resolved. Some leading cadres of farms still do not have a sufficient understanding of these problems, and still have the idea of ​​"getting immediate benefits". They do not know to seriously carry out basic construction projects and cultivate land fertility from a long-term perspective, and production is still blind. Second, some leading cadres of farms still lack experience in this new cause of state-owned farms, but they do not study their business well, so that they lack planning and scientificity in organizational leadership, and cannot well complete the production tasks given by the state. For example, Lutai Farm only completed 80% of the production tasks in 1951. Third, some leading cadres of farms are not very clear about the idea of ​​relying on workers to run the farm well. For example, some farms do not discuss production plans with workers; some farms have not paid attention to giving play to the role of trade unions, so they have not been able to fully unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of workers. In addition, some farms still have blind construction and waste of state assets in basic construction. In future work, in addition to seriously applying and promoting existing advanced methods and work experience such as deep plowing, close planting, dry direct seeding of rice, and combined operation of machinery, various state-owned farms should also strive to learn from advanced Soviet experience, and implement a grass-field rotation system and grass-field farming method with emphasis and preparation to cultivate land fertility, create a good environment for crop growth, and give full play to the potential efficiency of machinery. In terms of management, it is necessary to establish the idea of ​​relying on workers to run the farm well, strengthen planning and scientificity, and establish and improve various systems. In this way, state-owned farms will make rapid progress in increasing production and reducing costs, and will more fully demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of agriculture of a socialist nature.

    我国国营农场的初步成就
    韩长赓  李春桂
    我国的国营农场是社会主义性质的农业企业。它的基本特点，是在国有的大片土地上使用机械耕作，农场的全体职工是以国家主人翁的身份来进行集体劳动，完成国家所交给的生产任务。自新中国成立以来，在中央人民政府农业部领导之下，国营农场的事业已逐渐发展。各农场已初具规模，并作出了一些成绩。
    现有的较大的国营农场，除东北区以外，华北区有十个，华东区有三个，中南区有一个，西北区有
    一个。这十五个国营农场共有耕地面积五十五万五千多亩，职工四千二百余人；一九五○年播种面积十六万一千多亩，收获农产品折合小米约一千五百六十多万斤；一九五一年播种面积十六万五千余亩，收获农产品折合小米二千四百七十八万多斤。这些农场都有了足够的拖拉机、康拜因和其他各种机械农具。
    这些国营农场当中，芦台农场是规模比较大、设备比较完善的。它的总面积是五万二千多亩。除道路、沟渠、建筑物等占地外，农场耕种面积是四万四千四百多亩。全场都建设了水利工程，利用电力扬水灌溉。中央人民政府农业部机耕学校实习农场，它的总面积仅二千七百多亩，除了道路、建筑物等占地外，耕地面积有二千一百多亩。这个农场面积虽小，但它在各国营农场中还是比较先进的。
    这些国营农场，大部分都是在人烟稀少，荒芜多年或是在盐碱性较重的土地上建立起来的。关内各农场的十六万多亩播种面积中，除一万亩左右是熟地外，全部都是新开的荒地。好多农场都经过了相当艰苦的建场过程。如国营芦台农场，在日伪时期原是日寇为了剥削中国农民而建立起来的一个农场。日寇投降后，场内房屋、水利设备等都被国民党匪帮破坏，土地荒废。人民政府在一九四九年四月进行恢复工作时，场内野草丛生，满目荒凉。那年八月上旬，风雨连绵，蓟运河河水暴涨，场子被大水淹没。但是，全场的职工，在场长的领导下，一面抢险堵口，排除积水，一面仍然坚持复建工作。经过了一年的艰苦斗争，这个农场才在一九五○年五月正式成立。到目前为止，这个农场已经修建了房屋三百多间，拖拉机房、仓库等一百三十多间，全场装上了电灯。在水利方面，已经把整个农场的水利系统整理完毕，计建设了桥梁八十座，闸门八百八十七座，渠道及防水工程十三万六千八百多土方，道路工程二万九千二百四十七土方，扬水场二座，使农场百分之八十的土地都能用水灌溉。又如苏北东辛农场，在建场初期，是一大片荒芜了一百多年的盐碱地，人烟几乎绝迹，遍地长满了芦苇。全体职工经过艰苦奋斗，终于开垦出耕地一万六千九百亩。这个农场也已有了相当规模。
    大部分国营农场的耕地虽然都是新开的荒地和盐碱地，但经过二年来的经营，这些土地大部分已逐渐变成良田，农作物的产量已逐步提高。从一九五一年关内各农场的农业生产来看，十五个国营农场的种植总面积只比一九五○年增加了百分之三十一点五，但是总产量比一九五○年增加了百分之五十八，每亩产量平均比一九五○年提高百分之三十八。从几种主要作物来看：棉花一九五○年收获面积一万五千七百九十一亩，平均每亩产九十九点九斤；一九五一年收获面积一万四千六百七十九亩，平均每亩产一百五十点七斤，比一九五○年增加了百分之五十点八。水稻一九五○年收获面积一万七千六百三十亩，平均每亩产四百一十八斤；一九五一年收获面积一万九千八百四十六亩，平均每亩产四百七十斤，比一九五○年增加了百分之十二点四。小麦一九五○年收获面积二万二千四百九十二亩，平均每亩只收四十九点五斤；一九五一年收获面积三万八千六百一十四亩，平均每亩收到一百一十三点五斤，比一九五○年增加了百分之一百二十九。
    这两年来国营农场在生产上所作出的成绩，不仅在于产量的提高方面。一九五一年产量的提高，还只是一个开始。主要的成绩是部分农场已开始掌握了苏联的先进生产技术和经营管理方法。
    在农业技术方面：一九五一年基本上扭转了一九五○年只注意扩大开荒面积，而忽略耕作质量的偏向。如在深耕的问题上，一九四九年到一九五○年春，耕地最深的只到十五公分。一九五一年各场不但要求提高效率，而且提出了质量标准。目前耕地
    一般都已耕深到二十公分（约七寸）以上，这对农业增产将起决定性的作用。
    在农业技术上最主要的收获是棉花密植和水稻旱直播已收到效果。
    适当密植对于棉花增产是一个决定性的因素，是苏联的先进经验。但中国农民过去种棉都是稀植，各个农场也不例外。机耕学校实习农场在一九四九年刚办的时候，每亩种了一千五百株，结果每亩只收了籽棉四十八斤。第二年接受苏联专家的指导，开始试验密植，每亩种了二千五百株，结果每亩收了籽棉一百六十三斤。一九五一年每亩种了三千六百株，并进行了施肥、中耕、防治病虫害、整枝等一系列的田间管理工作，结果在九百四十四亩旱田上，每亩平均产量达到了籽棉二百九十六斤；七亩半丰产区棉田，每亩收获了五百三十七斤；超计划地完成了任务（原计划一般棉田每亩产二百五十斤，丰产区每亩产五百斤）。这一密植成功的经验，如在各场的大片土地上和农民中普遍推广起来，棉花就可以大量增产。如机耕学校实习农场密植棉花增产后，对附近农民起了示范作用。郭家营村农民一九五一年初步学习密植，产量已由一九五○年每亩产籽棉八十斤增加到一百零六斤。
    水稻旱直播也是苏联的先进经验。在大片的国营农场里栽培水稻，人力插秧是一个很大的问题。国营芦台农场，吸取了苏联先进的农业经验，一九五○年利用机械试行旱直播，并使用播幅加宽器，已经成功。方法是在播种前把地整好后，然后用播种机把稻种直接播在地里，然后适当放水。播种时把播幅加宽器安装在播种机的开沟器上，可以调整播种的深度和增加稻子的密度。用这种旱直播的方法，一部八十匹马力的拖拉机，连接四台播种机，八个人工，每小时可以播种四十五亩，比人工插秧的工作效率提高了十五倍到二十倍。
    在机务方面：目前各农场的拖拉机驾驶员或修理人员对拖拉机、康拜因机等机械农具，从驾驶、操纵、保养一直到修理等全套技术已能掌握。一九五一年各场的机具故障已大为减少。最重要的是一九五一年从耕地到收获，都使用了最先进的方法联接作业，因此提高了工作效率，节省了很多油料。例如有的农场在播种春小麦时，耙地已能联接使用四台苏式圆盘耙或联接六台美式圆盘耙，一台拖拉机动力、三个人工每小时平均可以耙地六十到九十亩，每亩用油零点一五到零点二五公斤。播种机已能联接四台使用，一台拖拉机动力，八个人工，每小时可以播种五十到六十亩，每亩用油零点一五到零点三公斤。一九五一年用两台“斯大林六号”康拜因机联接收割小麦，每小时平均收割二十二亩，比一九五○年增加了五点二五亩；用油量也每亩减低到零点七三公斤，比一九五○年节省零点六一公斤。（在苏联，用两台康拜因机联接收割，每小时平均收割二十四亩，每亩用油零点六五公斤。）
    在经营管理方面：经营方针已逐渐明确，就是认真学习苏联的先进经验。在组织机构上，从一九五一年起已把机关化的机构改变为生产队的组织形式。同时开始建立了专责制度，如机务上实行了包地、包车制；农业上实行了分区、分地制，这给农业经营的企业化打下了基础。在民主管理上，一般领导干部在几年来的生产实践中，已经认识到国营农场的生产计划，必须依靠工人，才能贯彻执行。因此，已开始树立了依靠工人办好农场的观点。目前，大多数农场已经建立了农场管理委员会和工会的组织。各农场工会的会员，平均已占各农场职工总人数的百分之八十五以上。多数农场的工会对于组织教育工人完成生产任务，办理职工福利事宜等，已经起了一定作用。在计划、统计工作上，一九五一年起，各场都开始制订了生产计划和财经计划，有的场已结合生产编订了成本计划，有的场制订了劳动力统一调配计划或饲养牲畜的饲料种植计划，有的场已初步制订了消耗定额计划。大多数国营农场的机耕队和会计室都配备了统计员。如芦台农场和机耕学校实习农场已建立了比较完整的日用表报，同时做到了田间记载和工作量的统计。在经济核算上，各场都已经按照中央人民政府农业部颁发的统一制度记账造表，因此已能反映出生产过程中的财务情况；部分农场并已在作业上试行人力、物力的消耗统计和记工制度。
    由于经营管理工作逐步走向健全，特别是各场普遍建立了工会和民主管理委员会，职工的政治觉悟和劳动积极性已显著提高。一九五一年一年中，各场普遍开展了爱国主义丰产竞赛运动，并出现了不少新纪录。如黄泛区农场的工人在进行播种中往播箱里加种时，最初不得法，加满三台播种机的种籽需要十六到十八分钟。在竞赛中大家想法改进，结果装一次种子只需二分钟到三分钟，提高了工作效率五倍到八倍。秋播时，用“纳齐”拖拉机连结三台播种机播种，创每小时播种七十点二亩到八十九点一六亩的新纪录，顺利地完成了四万五千亩的小麦播种任务。
    但目前国营农场还有许多缺点：第一、大部分农场都是在荒废多年的土地上建立起来的，直到目前为止，还没有很好地解决排水灌溉工程和消灭碱害、草害等问题。一些农场的领导干部对这些问题还认识不足，还有“得现利”的思想，不知道从长远利益着想认真地进行基本建设工程和培养地力，生产还带着盲目性。第二、有些农场的领导干部，对国营农场这个新的事业还缺乏经验，但又不好好钻研业务，以致在组织领导上缺乏计划性，科学性，不能很好地完成国家给的生产任务。如芦台农场一九五一年只完成生产任务百分之八十。第三、有些农场的领导干部对依靠工人办好农场的思想还不十分明确。如有的农场制订生产计划不和工人讨论；有的农场还没有注意发挥工会的作用，因此，还没有能够充分地发挥出工人的积极性和创造性。此外有的农场在基本建设上还有盲目施工浪费国家资财的现象。各国营农场在今后的工作中，除了应认真应用和推广已有的深耕、密植、水稻旱直播和机具联结作业等先进方法和工作经验外，更要努力学习苏联先进经验，有重点有准备地实行草田轮作制和草田耕作法，以培养地力，为作物生长创造良好环境，充分发挥机具的潜在效能。在经营管理上，要确立依靠工人办好农场的思想，加强计划性和科学性，建立并改进各种制度。这样，国营农场在提高产量和降低成本方面就会有飞速的进步，就会更充分地显示出社会主义性质的农业的无比优越性。
