    In the Autumn Grain Collection Last Year, Jiading County, Southern Jiangsu, Neglected Checking Grain Quality Standards, Resulting in a Loss of Public Grain Worth Over 500 Million Yuan After Storage

    To the Editor: In the autumn grain collection work last year, Jiading County, Southern Jiangsu, collected over 12 million jin of public grain from 71 townships and towns. According to the test results, the moisture and impurities of public grain in none of the townships and towns met the standards. The moisture and impurities of rice generally exceeded the standard by about 2 or 3 percent. According to statistics, the county lost a total of 626,500 jin of public grain in this autumn collection, equivalent to 538.79 million yuan (the loss of freight and storage has not yet been calculated).

    When the autumn grain collection began, leading cadres of the county party committee and county people's government did not sufficiently recognize the serious significance of improving the quality of public grain and reducing the loss of state wealth; they lacked sufficient estimation of the possible problems below. Therefore, in implementing the autumn grain collection work, they only generally called for "delivering dry and clean grain," and could not put forward positive measures. Because this county is a cotton-producing area, and the collection of cotton is the main task, leading cadres only unilaterally emphasized the collection of good cotton, thinking that the amount of rice was not large, and the publicity of the quality standards of the rice to be collected was insufficient. Some district, township, and village cadres shouted slogans about handing in good grain, but in fact, they themselves did not understand to what extent it should be "good"; some township, village cadres and farmers did not understand percentages, thinking that sunning it once or twice was almost enough, but in fact, it was far from enough. In addition, the grain collection cadres in this area had a simple task viewpoint. They only emphasized "time" and "numbers," but ignored the inspection of quality and standards, thus causing great losses to state property. I think the above lessons should attract the attention of all regions. Jiading County Communication Station, Southern Jiangsu

### 苏南嘉定县在去年秋征中  不重视检查粮食质量标准入仓后损耗公粮值五亿多元

    苏南嘉定县在去年秋征中
    不重视检查粮食质量标准入仓后损耗公粮值五亿多元
    编辑同志：苏南嘉定县在去年秋征工作中，有七十一个乡、镇共征收了一千二百多万斤公粮。现在根据化验结果，没有一个乡、镇的公粮水分、杂质是合乎标准的。稻谷的水分和杂质一般都超过标准百分之二、三左右，据统计：在这次秋征中全县共损耗公粮六十二万六千五百斤，合五亿三千八百七十九万元（运费和保管的损失还没有计算在内）。
    这个县在秋征开始时，县委、县人民政府领导干部对提高公粮质量、减少国家财富损失的严重意义认识不足；对下面可能发生的问题缺少足够的估计，因此，在贯彻秋征工作中，只是一般的号召“交干、交净”，提不出积极的办法。由于这个县是产棉区，以征收棉花为主，领导干部只片面地重视了征收好棉花，认为稻谷数量不多，对要征收的稻谷质量标准宣传不够。有些区、乡、村干部空喊缴好粮，其实连自己也不懂得应该“好”到什么程度；有的乡、村干部和农民不懂得百分比，认为晒一两次就差不多了，事实上还差得很远。再加上这个地区的征粮干部有单纯的任务观点，他们只强调“时间”和“数字”，却忽略了对质量和标准的检查，因而给国家财产造成很大损失。我认为以上的教训应当引起各地注意。  苏南嘉定县通讯站
