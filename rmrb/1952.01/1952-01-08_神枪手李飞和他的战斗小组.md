　　Sharpshooter Li Fei and His Combat Team
　　Gong Jiemin
　　Li Fei's combat team of the Sixth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army killed 360 enemies in the Fenghuoshan blocking battle, with no casualties of their own, creating a victory of "zero to three hundred and sixty." This event quickly spread throughout the army. Comrades praised Li Fei as a good fighter with courage and strategy. The regimental commander even wrote him a poem. Comrades from the Korean People's Army General Political Department Chorus are preparing to use song and dance to portray this hero and praise the heroic deeds of the Li Fei team.

　　Li Fei is a strong 21-year-old young man, a member of the Communist Youth League, and a famous machine gun shooter. After joining the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and arriving in Korea, he has been inspired by the heroic deeds of the immortal Yang Gensi platoon. During training, he was selected as a special-class shooter, hitting the 150-meter chest target 12 times out of 15 shots.

　　After the Fenghuoshan blocking battle started, Li Fei led his team to defend Yuefeng Mountain. On October 18th, the enemy used two battalions of troops, with airplanes and tanks attached, to besiege their position. Four enemy planes appeared over their position, and six tanks fired barrages non-stop. After the platoon leader conveyed the orders of the battalion and company commanders to the Li Fei combat team, he solemnly said to everyone:

　　"The superiors said that our position here is the most important. Do you think we can hold it?"

　　"Yes!"

　　"Right! We must not forget our merit-seeking plan when we came abroad." His words deeply moved the hearts of every soldier.

　　As soon as they entered the position, a new soldier heard the "hissing" sound of artillery shells, tightly gripped his gun, and lay motionless in the fortifications.

　　"Comrade, what are you holding in your hand?" Li Fei asked him.

　　"A gun," the soldier replied and then lowered his head again.

　　"What is a gun for?"

　　The soldier paused and replied, "To fight American devils."

　　"Can you fight American devils lying in the fortifications?"

　　The soldier's face turned red, and he immediately stood up and said, "Team leader, I will definitely listen to your commands. I will fight however you tell me to fight!"

　　Li Fei smiled. He said, "Right! To kill more devils, you have to be brave."

　　Cai Zihua, the ammunition loader who was lying on the side, also jumped up and said, "I will always be with the team leader. However fast your machine gun fires, I will guarantee to load the bullets just as fast."

　　"Good! Let's have a competition!" Li Fei said.

　　In a burst of intense artillery fire, the unfortunate news came that the platoon leader was seriously wounded and sacrificed. Only six people from their team remained on this position. Li Fei realized that a serious task had fallen on their shoulders. At this time, five soldiers looked at their team leader. Li Fei solemnly said to the soldiers: "Comrades! Stand up straight and fight! If there is no one to command, I will replace the platoon leader."

　　The soldiers mourned their fallen comrades with heavy hearts. Li Fei powerfully asked everyone:

　　"Comrades! Who killed our comrades?"

　　"American devils!"

　　"Who did they sacrifice for?"

　　"For the motherland, for the Korean people..."

　　"What should we do?"

　　"Avenge them!"

　　"Right, avenge them! No matter how fierce the enemy's artillery fire is, we must persevere." Li Fei said with confidence and excitement, "Perseverance is victory!"

　　As soon as he finished speaking, a barrage of artillery suddenly came from the enemy's position, followed by the frantic cries of enemy machine guns. Li Fei estimated according to the enemy's charging pattern that the enemy would charge up in at most five minutes. The soldiers saw groups of charging devils coming from afar, so everyone shouted in unison, "Team leader, the enemy is starting to attack!" But Li Fei slowly said, "Hold your breath! Don't pay attention to them until they get close." It wasn't until the enemy approached 150 meters that Li Fei said to the soldiers, "Comrades, watch me give a demonstration first, and let this 'flock of sheep' roll down the hillside." With a roar of his machine gun, the American devils fell one after another. At this time, another group of enemies braved the smoke and charged up again. Soldier Zhang Panliang pulled the pin of a grenade and impatiently shouted, "Team leader, the enemy is coming up again! Some are wearing black clothes, they must be Dutch soldiers." Li Fei had already noticed this, and he calmly directed, "You fight on the left, we will fight in the middle, and the rest go to the right. After firing, immediately change positions." Zhang Panliang had just thrown a grenade when he heard the howling of the devils down the mountain. He excitedly shouted, "Team leader, team leader, three of them were hit." When Li Fei heard this, he encouraged him, "Good! Fight like this, and you can earn merit."

　　The Li Fei team calmly and methodically attacked the advancing enemy again and again. The number of enemies killed and wounded continued to increase.

　　After continuously repelling five enemy attacks, Li Fei's machine gun barrel turned red, and the heat dissipation holes also turned red. However, before his machine gun could catch its breath, the enemy started another attack. Li Fei crawled out of the fortifications and saw thirty or forty devils crawling up along the gully. Li Fei's idea was: no matter how you charge, I won't let the eagle fly until I see the rabbit. If I don't have a sure shot, I won't fire a bullet easily. He calmly said to everyone, "Prepare the grenades and listen to my command!" When the enemy came within 30 meters, he shouted, "One—two!" A barrage of grenades was thrown out. Zhang Panliang shouted again, "Only three enemies went back." However, Li Fei knew that the enemy who had suffered a loss would not give up. He had a flash of inspiration and came up with a way to deal with the enemy's retaliation. So, he led the soldiers to quickly run to the left side of the communication trench, picked up large pieces of stone, piled them into the shape of a person, covered them with pine branches, and put on hats. After the camouflage was completed, they immediately moved to the new position on the right side of the communication trench. Ten minutes later, the enemy's artillery fire was indeed attracted, and the enemy fired artillery and machine guns. Li Fei happily said, "American devils, you can use as much strength as you have!" They calmly monitored the advancing enemy, and seeing the enemy charging up again, Li Fei aimed at these human targets and started shooting. Five soldiers cheered and assisted on the side. They praised Li Fei's machine gun for shooting well. They shouted:

　　"Look! Our team leader is really a sharpshooter!"

　　When the enemy began their tenth attack, in order to make the grenades more powerful and better annihilate the enemy, Li Fei used the experience introduced by friendly troops, and he shouted a rhythmic cadence to command:

　　"Comrades, listen to me:
　　One hand pulls the pin, one hand throws,
　　Kill and injure many enemies;
　　The bomb explodes upon impact with great power,
　　The devils cannot escape."

　　The soldiers hid in the fortifications, enjoying themselves while throwing grenades. Li Fei secretly tallied the number of enemies annihilated; when his machine gun started roaring, the soldiers also helped him tally the number of enemies annihilated.

　　Li Fei never gave up any possible opportunity. Before the enemy launched their eleventh charge, he wanted to observe the enemy's movements, but he could not raise his head due to the enemy's machine gun blockade. In order to avoid enemy artillery fire and achieve the purpose of annihilating a large number of enemies, he suddenly thought of the combat experience of friendly troops. Taking advantage of the gap when the enemy's machine gun was changing magazines, he waved his hand and said, "Go, bring enough grenades, follow me!" So, the soldiers followed him, cleverly bypassing to the mountainside in front along the communication trench, using bomb craters as concealed positions. Li Fei encouraged everyone, "Comrades, don't be afraid! This place is the best. It can both conceal and kill the enemy. The closer you are to the enemy, the less likely you are to be killed by artillery fire." They patiently waited with bated breath for the enemy. Soon, the devils stupidly charged up from the original direction again. When the enemies in front were hit hard by a rain of bullets, the enemies in the back were stunned, as if they had entered a bewitched formation, unable to guess where the bullets were coming from.

　　Li Fei and his team's comrades used skilled collective actions to deal with the enemy's group charges, and used clever and flexible tactics to deal with the enemy's "herding sheep tactics." The front, back, left, and right of the position, and both sides of the mountainside were filled with their fortifications. They constantly confused the enemy.

　　They fought cleverly with enemies who outnumbered them dozens or even hundreds of times. The fortifications on the position were leveled by enemy artillery fire several times, and they repaired them several times. When the bullets were about to run out, Li Fei braved the rain of bullets to take the initiative to find the First Company, asking them to command and retrieving ammunition, calmly guarding Yuefeng Mountain. He never forgot what the regimental commander had said before the start of this blocking battle: no matter which level of commander, the more critical the situation, the more they should remain calm and composed, because everyone is watching their actions. Li Fei thought: I am not only responsible for the survival of the position, but also for the lives of all comrades in the team. He made a promise to the whole team with incomparable confidence: "With me, Li Fei, I guarantee to hold the position!"

　　After continuously repelling eleven enemy attacks, Li Fei checked the bullets. The machine gun magazine was empty, and only a few grenades were left. He called on everyone to pick up stones to replace weapons.

　　From the start of the battle until the friendly neighboring units came up, Li Fei and his team continuously thwarted the enemy's attacks and always held firm at Yuefeng Mountain.

　　At night, the enemy's artillery fire stopped. Li Fei, with his five comrades, under the illumination of the glowing red fire, looked at the corpses of the beasts lying horizontally and vertically on the hillside, checking the number of enemies annihilated in four days and nights. They estimated that more than 360 enemies were killed. However, not a single hair on their bodies was taken away by the so-called superior equipped American invading army.

    神枪手李飞和他的战斗小组
    宫洁民
    人民志愿军某部第六连的李飞战斗小组，在烽火山阻击战中，打死敌人三百六十名，自己无一伤亡，创造了“零比三百六十”的胜利。这件事很快传遍了全军，同志们都赞扬李飞是有勇有谋的好战士，团长还给他写了一首诗；朝鲜人民军总政治部协奏团的同志们，正准备用歌舞来表现这位英雄，来歌颂李飞小组的英雄事迹。
    李飞是一个体格健强的二十一岁的小伙子，青年团员，有名的机枪射手。他参加人民志愿军来到朝鲜后，一直为不朽的杨根思排的英雄事迹鼓舞着。在练兵时他曾当选特等射手，一百五十公尺的胸靶，十五发子弹射中十二发。
    烽火山阻击战打响后，李飞带领着他的小组坚守在月烽山头。十月十八日那天，敌人用两个营的兵力，还附有飞机、坦克向他们的阵地围攻；四架敌机出现在他们阵地的上空，六辆坦克不停地打着排子炮。班长向李飞战斗小组传达了营、连首长的命令后，严肃地向大家说：
    “上级说咱们这里是最重要的阵地，你们说能不能守得住？”
    “能！”
    “对！咱们不能忘了出国时的立功计划。”他的话深深地打动了每个战士的心。
    刚一进入阵地，一个新战士听到炮弹“咝咝”的响声，便紧紧地握着枪、爬在工事里一动也不动。
    “同志，你手里拿的是什么？”李飞问他。
    “枪。”战士回答了以后又低下了头。
    “枪是干什么的？”
    战士怔了一下，回答说：“打美国鬼子的。”
    “爬在工事里不动，能打美国鬼子吗？”
    战士的脸一红，马上站了起来说：“组长，我一定听你的口令，叫怎样打就怎样打！”
    李飞笑了。他说：“对！要想多杀鬼子，就得勇敢起来。”
    爬在一边的压弹手蔡子华也跳了起来说：“我永远跟组长在一起，你的机枪打多快，我就保证把子弹压多快。”
    “好！咱们来个比赛吧！”李飞说。
    在一阵激烈的炮火中，传来了不幸的消息：班长负了重伤牺牲了，在这一个阵地上只剩下他们小组的六个人了。李飞认识到严重的任务已落到他们的肩上。这时，五个战士都望着自己的组长，李飞庄严地对战士们说：“同志们！挺起腰板来干！没有人指挥，我来代替班长。”
    战士们带着沉痛的心情悼念着已经牺牲了的同志们。李飞有力地问大家：
    “同志们！是谁打死了我们的战友？”
    “美国鬼子！”
    “他们为谁而牺牲的？”
    “为祖国，为朝鲜人民……”
    “咱们怎么办？”
    “报仇！”
    “对，报仇！不管敌人的炮火多凶，我们也要坚持下去。”李飞信心百倍地激昂地说：“坚持下去就是胜利！”
    他的话音刚落，突然从敌人的阵地上打来一阵排子炮，紧接着是敌人机枪的狂叫。李飞按照敌人冲锋的规律估计，顶多再过五分钟敌人就要冲上来。战士们望见集团冲锋的鬼子们从老远的地方上来了，于是大家齐声喊着：“组长，敌人开始进攻喽！”可是李飞却慢吞吞地说：“沉住气！不到跟前就不理他。”直到敌人接近一百五十公尺了，李飞才对战士们说：“同志们，看看我先来个示范动作，让这‘羊群’滚下山坡去。”随着他的一阵机枪的吼叫，美国鬼子们纷纷地倒下去了。这时，另一股敌人又冒着浓烟冲了上来。战士张盘亮把手榴弹的弦拉出来，不耐心地叫起来：“组长，敌人又上来喽！有的穿着黑衣裳，准是荷兰兵。”李飞早已注意到了，他沉着地指挥着：“你在左边打，我们在当中，其余的往右边去，打完马上转换位置。”张盘亮刚刚投了一个手榴弹，就听见山下鬼子们的嚎叫声。他兴奋地叫着：“组长，组长，打着了三个。”李飞听见了，鼓励他说：“好！就是这样打，这样打就能立功。”
    李飞小组沉着地有计划地打击着一次又一次进犯的敌人。敌人被打死打伤的数目在不断地增加着。
    连续地打退了敌人五次的进攻，李飞的机枪筒子都打红了，防热孔也红了起来。可是，敌人没等他的机枪喘息一下，就又开始了进攻。李飞从工事里爬出来一看，三、四十个鬼子又顺着山沟爬上来了。李飞的主意是：不管你怎样冲，反正是不见兔子不放鹰，没有十成十的把握，就不轻易放一颗子弹。他沉着地向大家说：“把手榴弹预备好，听口令！”当敌人走近三十公尺的距离时，他喊了一声：“一——二！”一排子手榴弹打了出去。张盘亮又叫了起来：“敌人就回去了三个。”但是，李飞知道吃了亏的敌人是不会死心的。他灵机一动，又想出了对付敌人报复的方法。于是，他带领着战士们疾速地跑到交通沟左侧，拣起了大块的石头，垒成了人的形状，蒙上松树枝，戴上帽子。等伪装好了，他们马上又运动到交通沟右侧的新阵地去了。十分钟以后，敌人的炮火果然被吸引过来了，敌人又打炮又打机枪。李飞高兴地说：“美国鬼子，你有多大劲，尽管施展好了！”他们沉静地监视着进犯的敌人，眼看敌人又冲到跟前了，李飞瞄准了这些人头靶，开始了射击。五个战士在一旁喝采助战，他们齐声称赞李飞的机枪打得好。他们叫着：
    “看啊！咱们的组长真是神枪手！”
    当敌人开始第十次的进攻时，为了使手榴弹更能发挥威力，更好地歼灭敌人，李飞利用了友军介绍的经验，他喊着快板来指挥：
    “同志们，听我说：
    一手拉弦一手投，
    杀伤敌人数目多；
    弹到即炸威力大，
    鬼子想逃逃不脱。”
    战士们隐蔽在工事里，一边乐着一边投弹。李飞在暗暗地统计着歼敌的数字；当他的机枪开始叫起来时，战士们也替他统计着歼敌的数字。
    李飞决不放弃一分一秒的可能利用的空隙。在敌人发起第十一次的冲锋以前，他想观察一下敌人的动静，可是由于敌人机枪的封锁，他不能抬头。为了避免敌人炮火的杀伤，达到大量歼敌的目的，他突然又想到了友军的战斗经验。乘着敌人的机枪换梭子的空隙，他把手一挥说：“走，把手榴弹带足，随我来！”于是，战士们跟着他，顺着交通沟巧妙地绕到前边的山腰下，利用弹坑作为隐蔽阵地。李飞鼓动大家说：“同志们，别怕！这个地方最好，既能隐蔽，又能杀伤敌人。离敌人越近，越不容易被炮火杀伤。”他们耐心地屏息等候着敌人。不久，鬼子们又傻头傻脑地从原来的方向冲上来了，当前面的敌人受到了一阵弹雨的痛击时，最后面的敌人怔住了，像入了迷魂阵一样，猜不透枪弹是从那边打来的。
    李飞和他的小组的同志们，用熟练的集体动作对付敌人的集团冲锋，用巧妙而灵活的战术对付敌人的“赶羊战术”。阵地的前后左右，山腰的两侧，到处都是他们的工事。他们不断地迷惑着敌人。
    他们机智地同超过自己数十倍甚至几百倍兵力的敌人搏斗着。阵地上的工事好几次被敌人的炮火打平了，他们又好几次地把它们抢修起来。在子弹将要打光时，李飞冒着弹雨主动地去找到了一连，要求他们指挥，并且取回了弹药，镇静地守卫在月烽山头。他一刻也没有忘记团长在这次阻击战开始前讲过的话：不论哪一级的指挥员，越在危急的情况下，越应当保持镇静和沉着，因为大家全看他一个人的动作。李飞这样想：我不仅要对阵地的存亡负责，还要对全组同志们的生命负责。他以无比的信心对全组提出保证说：“有我李飞在，保证守住阵地！”
    连续地打退了敌人十一次的进攻以后，李飞检查了一下子弹，机枪梭子空了，手榴弹也只剩下几个了，他号召大家拣起石头代替武器。
    从战斗打响直到友邻部队上来，李飞和他的小组连续挫败了敌人的进犯，始终坚守在月烽山头。
    夜间，敌人的炮火停息了。李飞带着他的五个战友，在通红的大火的照耀下，望着山坡下横躺竖卧的野兽们的尸体，清查着四昼夜歼敌的数字。他们估计被打死的敌人在三百六十名以上。然而，他们身上的一根汗毛也没有叫有着所谓优势装备的美国侵略军打掉。
