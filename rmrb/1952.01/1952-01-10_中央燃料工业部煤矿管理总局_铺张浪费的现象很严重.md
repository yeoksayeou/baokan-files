To the Editor: The Central Fuel Industry Department Coal Mine Management Bureau has serious wasteful practices. In order to cater to cadres at the section chief level and above, the bureau carried out extensive construction work in two dormitories, installing heating equipment and replacing the original tung oil-coated square brick floors with cement floors. Because there was no suitable place for the heating boiler, they illegally purchased private houses without authorization. It is understood that the heating project alone cost 360 million yuan (not including the purchase of private houses and cement floor projects). However, many of the bureau's collective dormitories are very crowded and lack proper heating equipment. This shows that the leading cadres are not sufficiently concerned about the lives of the masses. The bureau's personnel management system is also very chaotic. For example, in the newly established health section, some people have no work to do. In this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, I believe that the leading cadres of the Coal Mine Management Bureau should conduct a profound self-criticism.

    中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局
    铺张浪费的现象很严重
    编辑同志：中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局铺张浪费的现象很严重。这个局为了照顾处长以上的干部，在两处宿舍内大动土木，安装暖气设备，并把原涂有桐油的方砖地换成洋灰地。因安装暖气的锅炉没有适当的地方，他们便违法擅自购买民房。据了解，只暖气工程就花了三亿六千万元（尚不包括购民房及洋灰地工程）。但是，局里很多的集体宿舍却很挤，也无适当的取暖设备。这说明领导干部对群众生活是不够关心的。局里的人事管理制度也很混乱，像新成立的卫生科，有的人没有什么工作。在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，我认为煤矿管理总局领导干部应作深刻检讨。
