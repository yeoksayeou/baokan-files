    The Japanese People's Road to Victory
    --Reading Comrade Stalin's Congratulatory Telegram to the Japanese People

    On December 31, 1951, Comrade Stalin, through the Japanese Kyodo News Agency, congratulated the Japanese people on obtaining freedom and happiness and congratulated them on achieving complete victory in their heroic struggle for independence. Comrade Stalin's enthusiastic action is, without a doubt, a great encouragement not only to the Japanese people's struggle against American occupation and striving for independence and liberation, but also to the struggles of all oppressed nations in the world.

    Due to the signing of the illegal US-Japan "Separate Peace Treaty" and the "US-Japan Security Treaty," Japan is now under long-term American military occupation, economic plunder, and political oppression. The American occupiers, through their running dog—the Yoshida traitorous government, are turning Japan into a tool for the United States to expand its aggressive war in the East. The poverty and humiliation suffered by the Japanese people as a result are unprecedented in Japanese history. According to the economic report published by the Japanese Yoshida government's Economic Stabilization Board on July 13, 1951, the consumption level of the urban population in Japan in 1951 decreased to 70 percent compared to the pre-war period (1934-1936). However, the amount of tax borne by each Japanese person in 1951 was 151 percent of the pre-war period (1934-1936). According to the statistics in the October 1951 issue of the Japanese "Zen'ei" magazine, the number of unemployed people in Japan, including unemployed and semi-unemployed workers, reached 9 million, and the rural unemployed population also reached 9 million, totaling as many as 18 million. Although the "special procurement" orders of the American war of aggression against Korea support the false "prosperity" of the Japanese economy, more than 200 Japanese companies went bankrupt in December of 1951 alone.

    Japanese workers, peasants, intellectuals, and other patriotic elements are struggling to get rid of this fate that the American imperialists have created, which is leading Japan to destruction. The heroic struggle of the Japanese people is sympathized with by the Soviet people, the Chinese people, and all peace-loving people in the world. We, like the Soviet people, believe that just as the Soviet people and the Chinese people have defeated and expelled foreign occupiers in the past, the Japanese people will surely be able to seek the rebirth and independence of their motherland!

### 日本人民走向胜利的道路——读斯大林同志给日本人民的贺电

    日本人民走向胜利的道路
    ——读斯大林同志给日本人民的贺电
    斯大林同志在一九五一年十二月三十一日经日本共同通讯社祝贺日本人民得到自由幸福，祝贺他们争取独立的英勇斗争获得完全胜利。斯大林同志的这个热情的举动，毫无疑问，不但对于日本人民反对美国占领、争取独立解放的斗争，而且对于全世界一切被压迫民族的斗争，都是一个极大的鼓舞。
    由于非法的美日单独“和约”和“美日安全条约”的签订，日本已处于美国长期的军事占领、经济掠夺和政治压迫之下。美国占领者通过他的走狗——吉田卖国政府，正在把日本变为美国在东方扩大侵略战争的工具。日本人民由此而遭遇的贫困和屈辱，是日本历史上从来没有过的。据日本吉田政府经济安定本部于一九五一年七月十三日发表的经济报告，日本都市人口一九五一年生活的消费水平和战前（一九三四至一九三六年）比较起来，下降至百分之七十。而一九五一年日本人民每人负担的税额，则为战前（一九三四至一九三六年）的百分之一百五十一。又据日本前卫杂志一九五一年十月号的统计，日本的失业人口，工人的失业者及半失业者达九百万人，农村失业人口也有九百万人，共计一千八百万人之多。尽管美国侵朝战争的“特需”订货支撑着日本经济的虚假“繁荣”，但是仅在一九五一年的十二月就有二百多家的日本公司倒闭了。
    日本的工人、农民、知识界和其他爱国分子正在为摆脱美帝国主义所制造的这种使日本走向毁灭的命运而斗争。日本人民的英勇斗争，是苏联人民、中国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民所同情的。我们和苏联人民一样地相信，正如苏联人民和中国人民在过去曾经战胜和驱逐了外国的占领者一样，日本人民一定也能求得他们祖国的新生和独立！
