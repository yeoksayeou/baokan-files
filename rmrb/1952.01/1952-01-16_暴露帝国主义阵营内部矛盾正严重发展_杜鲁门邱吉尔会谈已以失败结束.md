Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: U.S. President Truman and British Prime Minister Churchill held talks in Washington from January 7th to 8th. The purpose of these talks between the heads of the two leading countries in the imperialist camp was to find a way out for the imperialist aggression policies that have suffered serious setbacks around the world and for the growing mutual contradictions between American and British imperialism. However, the communique issued at the end of the talks shows that this attempt by U.S. and British imperialism was unsuccessful.

The communique once again proves that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of people all over the world, and that Britain remains willing to subserviently act as a pitiful follower of the United States. Aggressors Truman and Churchill have not learned the lessons they should have from the repeated failures of imperialist aggression policies. In the communique, they still express their "determination" to continue implementing the various aggression policies they are currently pursuing around the world. Although U.S. and British imperialism have suffered disastrous defeats in the war of aggression against Korea, and have thus been forced to hold armistice negotiations with the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, Truman and Churchill still do not abandon their plan to invade Korea under the guise of the United Nations. In the communique, they openly stated that they "will continue to fully support the United Nations' measures to resist aggression in Korea" until American-style "peace and security" are implemented in Korea. At the same time, the communique of Truman and Churchill reveals that U.S. and British imperialism are planning further attacks on the people of Asia. The communique said that the "overriding need" in the Far East is to "resist the communist threat in this region." The communique also welcomed the military conference that began in Washington on January 11th between the United States, Britain, and France to discuss "specific measures" to strengthen the offensive against the people of Southeast Asia. The communique also stated that the United States and Britain will continue to promote the plan to organize a so-called "European Army" including West German troops, believing that this is the "best way" to arm West Germany.

Despite the fact that Truman and Churchill have thus blatantly announced their aggression plans on paper, and have tried their best to trumpet their "determination to unify strength and will," they cannot hide the fact that the serious contradictions between the United States and Britain in implementing these aggression plans are unsolvable, and that these contradictions clearly pose a danger of paralyzing their various aggression plans. People can see in the communique of Truman and Churchill that the United States and Britain cannot eliminate their differences in the imperialist policies they have adopted toward China; the United States still cannot force Britain to participate in the "European Group" proposed by the so-called Pleven Plan and Schuman Plan; at the same time, Britain still refuses to agree to appoint an American as the Supreme Naval Commander of the North Atlantic Group, and to use American rifles as the standard rifles of the North Atlantic Group.

TASS Washington, January 11th: "American newspapers and news agencies, in commenting on the Truman-Churchill talks, had to admit that the negotiations essentially ended in failure; none of the results expected by the U.S. government and the British government were achieved on any of the issues. Before the talks, American newspapers pointed out that the main objectives Truman wanted to achieve in the negotiations with Churchill were to formulate a common action plan between the United States and Britain toward the Soviet Union, the Far East, Asia, the Near East, and the Middle East… and to resolve other major foreign policy issues that manifested the sharp intensification of U.S.-British contradictions. Now, according to American newspapers, ‘mutually agreed decisions’ were not reached on almost all issues. Reston, a Washington correspondent for the ‘New York Times,’ wrote in evaluating the results of the talks, based on remarks from Washington officials, that everyone in Washington believes that ‘no specific agreement has been reached at present,’ and that ‘the two leaders have not eliminated the difficulties and differences that have arisen in U.S.-British relations over the past two years.’"

These talks were first proposed by Churchill. Shortly after taking office as Prime Minister at the end of last October, he announced that he would travel to the United States in January of this year to meet with Truman. For nearly two months, both the United States and Britain had been busy preparing for the talks. During this period, Churchill had specifically traveled to Paris on December 17th and 18th of last year to meet with French Prime Minister Pleven. These actions demonstrate the importance that the entire imperialist camp attached to the talks. But the result was that even a telegram from Washington from the United Press on January 9th could not help but admit: "Truman and Churchill discussed all the major issues in the world, but did not reach any sensational conclusions on any major issues." This fact once again exposes to the world how serious the developing contradictions within the imperialist camp have become.

### 暴露帝国主义阵营内部矛盾正严重发展  杜鲁门邱吉尔会谈已以失败结束

    暴露帝国主义阵营内部矛盾正严重发展
    杜鲁门邱吉尔会谈已以失败结束
    【新华社十五日讯】一月七日至八日，美国总统杜鲁门和英国首相邱吉尔在华盛顿举行了会谈。帝国主义阵营内这两个魁首国家首脑人物之所以要举行这次会谈，其目的是要替已在全世界各地遭到严重挫折的帝国主义侵略政策和继续发展中的美英两帝国主义的相互矛盾寻找出路。但是，会谈结束时发表的公报表明，美英帝国主义的这种企图没有成功。
    公报再度证明美帝国主义是全世界人民的死敌，而英国仍甘心屈从地充当美国一名可怜的追随者。侵略者杜鲁门与邱吉尔没有从帝国主义的侵略政策到处失败中得到应有的教训，他们在公报中仍然表示他们“决心”在全世界继续推行目前正在推行的各项侵略政策。虽然美英帝国主义在侵略朝鲜的战争中已惨遭失败，因而不得不被迫与中朝人民军队举行停战谈判，但是，杜鲁门与邱吉尔仍然不放弃他们假联合国之名以侵略朝鲜的打算。他们在公报中公然表示“将继续全力支持联合国在朝鲜抵御侵略的措施”，直到在朝鲜实行美国式的“和平与安全”为止。同时，杜鲁门与邱吉尔的公报透露，美英帝国主义正在策划进一步进攻亚洲人民的计划。公报说，在远东“凌驾一切的需要”的，就是“抵御这个地区的共产主义威胁”。公报也对一月十一日在华盛顿开始举行的美、英、法三国讨论加强进攻东南亚人民的“具体措施”的军事会议表示欢迎。公报同时还表示美英两国将继续促成组织包括西德军队在内的所谓“欧洲军”的计划，认为这是武装西德的“最好的方法”。
    尽管杜鲁门与邱吉尔在纸面上这样赤裸裸地宣布了他们的侵略计划，竭力吹嘘他们“决心统一力量与意志”，但是他们却隐瞒不住美英两国间在实行这些侵略计划上所存在的严重矛盾已无法解决，而这种矛盾显然已有使他们的各项侵略计划陷于瘫痪的危险。人们在杜鲁门与邱吉尔的公报中可以看到，美英两国无法消除它们对中国所采取的帝国主义政策中的分歧；美国仍然不能逼迫英国参加所谓普利文计划和舒曼计划所建议的“欧洲集团”；同时，英国也仍然拒绝同意以美国人担任北大西洋集团的海军总司令，以美国步枪作为北大西洋集团的标准步枪。
    塔斯社华盛顿十一日电指出：“美国报纸和通讯社评论杜鲁门与邱吉尔的会谈时，不得不承认，这次谈判本质上是以失败结束的；在任何一个问题上都没有达到美国政府和英国政府预期的结果。美国报纸在这次会谈以前指出，杜鲁门在和邱吉尔谈判时要达到的主要目的，是制订美英两国对苏联、远东、亚洲、近东和中东的共同行动方针……解决表现美英矛盾尖锐化的其他最重大的外交政策问题。现在，据美国报纸报道，几乎在所有的问题上都没有得出‘彼此协议的决定’。‘纽约时报’驻华盛顿记者莱斯顿在评价会谈的结果时根据华盛顿官员的言论写道，华盛顿所有的人都认为：‘目前任何具体的东西都没有达成协议’，‘两国领袖并没有消除两年来美英关系中所发生的困难和分歧’。”
    这次会谈是邱吉尔首先倡议的。他在去年十月底出任首相后不久，就宣布定于今年一月赴美与杜鲁门会谈。将近两个月来，美英双方都曾为这次会谈进行了忙碌的准备，其间，邱吉尔曾特地于去年十二月十七日至十八日赴巴黎与法国总理普利文举行了会谈，这些行动说明整个帝国主义阵营对这次会谈的重视。但是结果却连合众社一月九日从华盛顿发出的电讯中都不能不承认：“杜鲁门与邱吉尔讨论了世界上一切重大的问题，但是没有就任何主要问题得出任何耸人听闻的结论。”这个事实又一次向全世界暴露了帝国主义阵营内部正在发展着的矛盾已到了如何严重的程度。
