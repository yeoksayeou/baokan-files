    Coal Mine Management Bureau's Self-Criticism on Extravagance and Waste

    Editor: The criticism of our bureau's wastefulness made by Zhang Jinyan, published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on January 10th, is completely correct, we believe.

    For more than two years, the bureau's leadership's bureaucraticism and departmentalism, as well as the bourgeois hedonistic ideas acquired after entering the city, have caused significant losses to the Party and the state. The leading cadres of our bureau have made painful self-criticisms at the enlarged cadre meeting of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry and at the all-staff meeting of our bureau, and have requested the higher authorities to send personnel to inspect and request the higher authorities to give due punishment.

    Now, we are gradually correcting our mistakes. We have moved a large part of the collective dormitories to Black Sesame Hutong (with heating equipment), correcting the crowded phenomenon in the collective dormitories, and others are being improved.

    煤矿管理总局对铺张浪费的检讨
    编辑同志：一月十日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了张谨言对我局浪费现象的批评，我们认为完全正确。
    两年多来，我局领导方面的官僚主义和本位主义，以及入城之后沾染上的资产阶级的享乐思想，给党和国家造成了重大的损失。我局领导干部已分别在中央燃料工业部的扩大干部会议和我局全体职工会议上作了沉痛的自我检讨，已呈请上级派员检查和请求上级给以应得的处分。
    现在，我们正在逐步地改正错误。我们已把一大部分的集体宿舍迁到黑芝麻胡同（有暖气设备），纠正了集体宿舍挤的现象，其他的也在改进中。
