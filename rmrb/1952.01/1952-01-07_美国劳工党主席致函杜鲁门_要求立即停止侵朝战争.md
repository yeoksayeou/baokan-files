Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 5th: The American people are constantly demanding a swift end to the Korean War. According to a report in the "National Guardian Weekly," a publication of the American Progressive Party, on December 19th of last year, calls against continuing the Korean War were issued from all over the United States in early December. Vito Marcantonio, Chairman of the American Labor Party, wrote an open letter to Truman, which stated: "The tragic consequences of the Korean War have taught our people a lesson: the best way for the United States to defend itself in Korea is to stop the fighting now; the best way to save the lives of Americans in Korea is to achieve peace in Korea immediately. Contending for territory in Korea will not save American lives. Only an immediate ceasefire can save American lives. ...I am only one of the majority of Americans who are making the same demand of you today." Pamphlets containing Marcantonio's open letter have been sent to all newspapers in New York.

The US government's insistence on unreasonable demands during the Korean armistice negotiations, obstructing a ceasefire, is not only opposed by progressive people in the United States but has also aroused dissatisfaction among some bourgeois public opinion. According to the same issue of the "National Guardian Weekly," columnist Frawley of the "Chicago Sun-Times" commented on December 5th on the unreasonable demands of the US side, which wanted to massively transport its troops and equipment into Korea during the ceasefire while demanding that the Korean-Chinese side guarantee not to "concentrate" military forces in North Korea, including restricting the construction of facilities within North Korea. Frawley said: "The enemy must not increase their air power in North Korea during the ceasefire. But can the United Nations forces – can it increase its ground forces in South Korea during the ceasefire? From the question raised, it is clear that the United Nations forces hope to be able to do so. How crazy this is! Your opponent is weak in some respects, and he must remain weak during the ceasefire. And you are weak in some respects, but you can strengthen yourself during the same ceasefire! The United Nations forces can replenish ammunition and weapons for training their troops, and can replenish new troops to replace the tired troops of 'equal strength'. But the enemy must never improve airports or repair them at the same time as the United Nations forces are strengthening its combat personnel."

### 美国劳工党主席致函杜鲁门  要求立即停止侵朝战争

    美国劳工党主席致函杜鲁门
    要求立即停止侵朝战争
    【新华社布拉格五日电】美国人民不断要求迅速结束朝鲜战争。据美国进步党机关刊“国民前卫周刊”去年十二月十九日报道，在去年十二月初，美国各地都发出反对继续进行朝鲜战争的呼声。美国劳工党主席马肯托尼奥曾给杜鲁门写了一封公开信，其中说：“朝鲜战争的悲惨后果给我国人民一个教训，就是美国在朝鲜防守的最好办法是现在就停火；保全在朝鲜的美国人的性命的最好办法是立即实现朝鲜的和平。在朝鲜争夺地盘并不能拯救美国人的性命。只有立即停火才能拯救美国人的性命。……我只是今天向你提出同样要求的大多数美国人中间的一个而已。”印有马肯托尼奥的这封公开信的小册子，已分别送给纽约的所有报纸。
    美国政府在朝鲜停战谈判中坚持无理要求，阻挠停战的行为，不仅受到美国进步人民的反对，甚至也引起某些资产阶级舆论的不满。据同日的“国民前卫周刊”说，“芝加哥太阳时报”的专栏作家弗劳姆在十二月五日著文评论美方一面要在停战期间把自己的军队和装备大量运入朝鲜，一面又要朝中方面保证不在朝鲜北部“集结”军事力量包括限制修建朝鲜境内设备的无理要求。弗劳姆说：“敌方绝不能在停战期间在北朝鲜增加他们的空军力量。但是联合国军——它能不能在停战期间在南朝鲜增加它的地面力量呢？从提出的问题看来，联合国军显然希望能够这样做。显而易见，这是多么疯狂啊！你的对手在某方面薄弱，他在停战期间就必须保持薄弱。而你在某方面薄弱，你却可以在同样的停战期间增强起来！联合国军可以补充供训练它的军队之用的弹药和武器，可以补充新的部队来代替
    ‘同等兵力’的疲惫的部队。但是敌方在联合国军增强它的战斗人员的同时，却绝不能改进飞机场或修理它们。”
