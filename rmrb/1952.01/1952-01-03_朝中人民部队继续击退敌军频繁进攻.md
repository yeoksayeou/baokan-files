Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 2nd -- Our front-line reporter reports: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continue to repel frequent small-scale attacks by the American invading army in many places along the entire front.

	On the morning of the 23rd of last month, an American battalion, supported by twenty-four tanks, attacked an unnamed hill southeast of Shangpu Defense in the northwest of Lianchuan. A certain unit of our army fought fiercely with the enemy for more than five hours, repelling the enemy and killing or wounding more than 200 enemy soldiers. At 8:00 a.m. on the same day, more than 100 American infantrymen and twelve tanks attacked a high ground north of Jinhua in the central front, and were stubbornly resisted by a sentry squad of our army. After killing and wounding many enemies, this squad took the initiative to withdraw from the position. Shortly after the enemy occupied the position, our army suddenly bombarded the enemy with fierce artillery fire, killing or wounding more than 30 enemies and destroying two tanks. The position was then recovered by our army.

	From the night of the 24th to the 25th, heavy snow fell across the entire front. On this Christmas holiday, the American invaders still forced their soldiers, who were eager to return home and live in peace, to launch more than fourteen attacks on the western and central fronts. On the snow-covered mountains where the snow was knee-deep, lay the corpses of many American invading soldiers.

    朝中人民部队继续击退敌军频繁进攻
    【新华社朝鲜前线二日电】本社前线记者报道：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军继续在全线许多地方击退美国侵略军频繁的小规模进攻。
    上月二十三日晨，西线美军一个营在二十四辆战车的配合下，向涟川西北上浦防东南一个无名高地进犯。我军某部与敌激战五个多小时，将敌击退，并杀伤敌军二百多人。同日晨八时，美军步兵一百多人和战车十二辆进犯中线金化以北的一个高地，遭到我军一个前哨班的顽强阻击。这个班在杀伤许多敌人后，主动撤出阵地。敌军占领阵地后不久，我军突然用猛烈炮火向敌轰击，杀伤敌三十多人，并击毁战车两辆，阵地又为我军收复。
    二十四日夜到二十五日，全线大雪纷飞。在这个圣诞节日，美国侵略者仍迫使其渴望回家过和平生活的士兵，在西线和中线进行了十四次以上的进攻。在雪深过膝的山岭上，横陈着许多美国侵略军士兵的尸体。
