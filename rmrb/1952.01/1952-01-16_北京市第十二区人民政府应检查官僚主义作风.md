To the Editor: The People's Government of the Twelfth District of Beijing Municipality has serious bureaucratic work styles, leading to problems of corruption, waste, and concealment of counter-revolutionaries, which have endangered revolutionary work. For example, the work of the Fengtai Supply Station is very important, but the Twelfth District People's Government transferred the counter-revolutionary element Hua Xianpeng to be the administrator. After Hua was arrested in 1951, the corrupt and degenerate element Ma Jiaxi, whose political background was unclear, was assigned to be in charge. In less than two months after Ma took office, he embezzled 136 catties of pork, worth 843,200 yuan. (The exact amount of other embezzled funds is being thoroughly confessed by Ma Jiaxi and investigated by relevant parties.) After Ma Jiaxi took over the Fengtai Supply Station, he took advantage of the short stays of troops passing through, falsely reporting the amount of meat consumed. For example, on one occasion, troops actually ate 62 catties of pork, but he falsely reported 140 catties. He even fed the troops rotten leftover meat in order to achieve his goal of embezzlement, seriously endangering the health of the troops. The Twelfth District People's Government did not have a good in-depth understanding of the work of the Fengtai Supply Station. It cost more than 30 million yuan to build a mat shed that could accommodate five or six thousand people, but in fact, building one that could accommodate two thousand people would have solved the problem. Furthermore, the newly installed high-altitude water pump could not be used because of poor planning, wasting money.

It is hoped that the Twelfth District People's Government will conduct an in-depth examination and improvement of these situations.

    北京市第十二区人民政府应检查官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：北京市第十二区人民政府有严重的官僚主义作风，以致发生贪污、浪费和隐藏反革命分子的问题，使革命工作受到危害。如丰台补给站的工作是很重要的，第十二区人民政府却把反革命分子滑羡鹏调去当管理员。滑犯在一九五一年被捕获后，又派政治面貌不清的贪污、腐化分子马家僖负责。马到职后不到两个月，就贪污猪肉一百三十六斤，计八十四万三千二百元。（其他贪污数字正令马家僖彻底坦白和有关各方检举彻查中。）马家僖接办丰台补给站后，利用过境部队匆促停留的机会，假报吃肉数字。如有一次过境部队实吃猪肉六十二斤，他谎报一百四十斤；甚至为了达到贪污的目的把陈腐的剩肉给部队同志们吃，严重地危害了部队同志们的健康。第十二区人民政府，对丰台补给站工作并没有很好地深入了解。打一座席棚花了三千多万元，能容五、六千人，事实上打一个容纳两千人的也能解决问题；再如新装的高空压水机，因计划不周，花了钱不能用。
    希望第十二区人民政府对这些情况深入检查改进。　程序
