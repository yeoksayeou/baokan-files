	Leading Cadres Should Not Indulge or Accommodate Corrupt Elements
	Editor: Leading cadres should not indulge or accommodate corrupt elements. The following case is a good lesson. Zhou Qingzhang, director of the Baoding Engineering Section of the Tianjin Railway Administration, accepted bribes of four million yuan and a leather jacket from private merchants when he was in charge of various engineering construction tasks in 1950. The administrative leaders of the Engineering Section discovered Zhou Qingzhang's illegal activities as early as January of last year, but did not take appropriate action. He believed that Zhou had done good work in the past and was afraid that exposing him would affect Zhou's mood. He also did not tell the Party branch or the trade union, but only talked to Zhou individually and sent the materials as a "confidential document" to the Engineering Section of the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau. The workers all knew about this illegal and corrupt act, and Communist Party member Su Qun even wrote a critical article for the Railway Worker Newspaper. After the Party branch learned about this from the workers, it did not use a serious attitude to boldly expose and fight. The branch secretary also criticized Su Qun for lacking organization and repeatedly told him not to publish it when the Railway Worker Newspaper sought opinions, in order to avoid affecting unity. This corruption incident was dragged on until October of last year, when the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau gave Zhou Qingzhang a demerit and ordered him to return the bribes. Facts have proved that such handling not only did not give Zhou Qingzhang a profound education, but also failed to thoroughly eliminate corruption in the Engineering Section. Several foremen and some personnel in the trade union of the Engineering Section were involved in corruption, which is inseparable from the indulgence and accommodation of corrupt elements by leading cadres. Therefore, I believe that leading cadres must mobilize the masses to vigorously expose corrupt elements.

    领导干部不应对贪污分子姑息迁就
    编辑同志：领导干部对贪污分子，不应姑息迁就。下面的事例，就是一个很好的教训。天津铁路管理局保定工务段主任周庆璋，在一九五○年负责各项工程修建任务时，曾接受私商贿赂金四百万元、皮衣一件。工务段行政领导干部在去年一月就发现了周庆璋的违法行为，但没有作适当的处理。他认为周在过去工作得不错，怕揭露后会影响周的情绪。他也没有告诉党的支部和工会，只是和周个别谈了话，用“秘件”把材料寄到北京铁路分局工务科。工人们都知道这件违法贪污的事，共产党员苏群还写了一篇批评稿子给铁路工人报。党支部从工人中知道这件事后，也不用严肃的态度，大胆地揭发和斗争。支部书记还批评苏群没有组织性，当铁路工人报社征求意见时，他一再叮嘱不要发表，以免影响团结。这件贪污事件一直拖到去年十月，才由北京铁路分局给周庆璋以记大过一次和交回贿赂金的处分。事实证明，这样的处理不只没有使周庆璋得到深刻的教育，而且不能使工务段彻底肃清贪污现象。工务段的几个工长、工会里的某些人员都有贪污，这是和领导干部对贪污分子姑息迁就分不开的。因此，我认为领导干部必须发动群众，大张旗鼓地检举贪污分子。  南北
