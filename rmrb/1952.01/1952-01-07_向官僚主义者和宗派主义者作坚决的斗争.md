    Resolutely Struggle Against Bureaucrats and Sectarians

    Under our people's democratic regime, why are there still so many people who dare to steal and embezzle state property without restraint? The course of events in which the corrupt criminals of the Jinan Industrial Bureau's Business Section were exposed and punished tells us that one of the important reasons is that the leading cadres of some organs have not only serious bureaucracy but also serious sectarianism. When using cadres and handling cadre issues, they do not take the interests of the Party and the people as the standard at all, but proceed from vulgar relationships such as "old superiors" and "old subordinates," and favor some people and attack others without any principles, even to the point of "appointing people by favoritism," completely losing the principled stance and excellent style that a revolutionary organization and revolutionary organ should have.

    The bureaucratic and sectarian style of Wang Xinmin and Dong Zhongchi, the secretary and deputy secretary of the Jinan Industrial Bureau's Party Committee, as exposed in this incident, has reached a very serious degree. Lu Yuan, the head of the Business Section, and others not only colluded with non-Party cadres and unscrupulous merchants, embezzled and degenerated, gambled and whored, but also went so far as to collude with hidden counter-revolutionaries, refusing to accept cadres assigned by the Party to work in the Business Section. Its nature is no different from betraying the Party! However, when Cui Zhusan, the deputy head of the Business Section, reported the criminals, the Party Committee of the Industrial Bureau repeatedly refused to accept it! And they reversed black and white, falsely accusing Cui Zhusan: "If there is corruption in your section, you are also responsible!" They ordered the whistleblower to reflect, instead of investigating the criminals! Even after some corrupt elements had confessed their crimes of dividing the spoils in court, the deputy secretary of the Industrial Bureau's Party Committee still arbitrarily said that this corrupt element "did not divide the spoils." They desperately looked for Cui Zhusan's shortcomings, wanting to arrange a mass meeting to "struggle" against Cui Zhusan, falsely accusing Cui Zhusan of also being involved in corruption.

    If the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee and the Jinan Municipal Committee of the CPC had not adhered to the correct policy and conducted a serious investigation and handling of this incident, then what kind of institution the Jinan Industrial Bureau and its affiliated agencies would have become is imaginable! It can be clearly seen here that the anti-corruption struggle is not only a struggle against embezzlers and thieves, but also a struggle against the extremely serious bureaucratic and sectarian style of certain leading organs and leading cadres. Without severely punishing these hateful protectors, hateful bureaucrats, and sectarian elements, righteousness cannot be uplifted, and evil cannot be overcome! This issue should arouse the serious attention of leading organs in various regions!

    向官僚主义者和宗派主义者作坚决的斗争
    在我们人民民主的政权下，为什么还有许多人敢于肆无忌惮地偷盗和侵吞国家的财产呢？济南工业局经营科的贪污罪犯们被揭发和被惩治的经过情形告诉我们，重要的原因之一，是若干机关的领导干部不仅有着严重的官僚主义，而且有着严重的宗派主义。他们在使用干部和处理干部问题时，完全不是以党和人民的利益为标准，而是从“老上级”、“老部下”之类的庸俗关系出发，毫无原则地偏袒一些人，打击一些人，甚至发展到“用人唯亲”的地步，完全丧失了革命组织和革命机关应有的原则立场和优良作风。
    在这个事件中暴露出来的济南工业局党委正副书记王新民、董仲池的官僚主义和宗派主义作风，已经达到了十分严重的程度。经营科科长陆原等不仅勾结非党干部和奸商，贪污腐化，赌博嫖妓，而且发展到勾结暗藏的反革命分子，拒绝收留党所委派的干部到经营科工作。其性质已和叛党无异！但是经营科副科长崔祝三检举罪犯时，工业局的党委竟几次拒绝接受！并且颠倒黑白，反诬崔祝三：“你科有贪污，你也有责任！”令揭发者反省，而不追究罪犯们！甚至在有的贪污分子已经在法院里坦白了分赃的罪行以后，工业局党委副书记还在武断地说这个贪污分子“没有分赃”。他们拚命地找寻揭发者崔祝三的缺点，要布置大会来“斗争”崔祝三，诬陷崔祝三也有贪污行为。
    如果没有中共中央山东分局和中共济南市委坚持正确的方针，对这一事件进行认真的调查处理，那末，济南工业局及其所属机构会变成一种什么性质的机构，是可以想像的！这里可以明显地看出：反贪污的斗争不仅是对贪污盗窃分子的斗争，也是对某些领导机关和领导干部的极端严重的官僚主义和宗派主义作风的斗争。不严重地惩罚这些可恶的袒护者，可恶的官僚主义分子和宗派主义分子，正气就无法抬头，邪气就无法压倒！这个问题，应该引起各地领导机关的严重注意！
