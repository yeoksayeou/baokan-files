Beijing capitalist Li Wenxuan, manager of the privately-owned Tianmin Medical Equipment Factory, has consistently engaged in speculation and profiteering, tax evasion, and theft of state assets. The state property he has defrauded, based solely on what has already been investigated, amounts to more than 2 billion yuan. Li Wenxuan has now been arrested by the Beijing Municipal People's Government.

Li Wenxuan was originally a drug offender. During the period of enemy and puppet rule, he colluded with the enemy and puppet henchmen, acting as a tyrant. After liberation, Li Wenxuan continued his malfeasance. Shortly after Taiyuan was liberated, he bribed officials with 140 million yuan to steal a warehouse of medical equipment from the Taiyuan Health Department, secretly transporting it to Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai for clandestine auctions. This batch of equipment is estimated to be worth no less than 2 billion yuan in total.

Li Wenxuan used the "Tianmin Medical Equipment Factory" as a front to swindle and deceive everywhere, taking orders for goods. After obtaining payment, he would resort to delaying tactics and never deliver on time; the goods he delivered were mostly cobbled together and unusable. On October 17, 1950, the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau ordered six electric centrifuge precipitators from the "Tianmin Medical Equipment Factory," agreeing to deliver them in two months and paying the full amount in advance. Li Wenxuan used the money for speculative business and failed to deliver even one precipitator by the deadline. Li Wenxuan then used deceptive means to re-negotiate a contract with the Public Health Bureau, stipulating that if the goods were not delivered by December 17, a daily penalty equivalent to 2% of the total value of the goods would be imposed; if the goods were not delivered by February 20, 1951, the daily penalty would be 1% of the total value. As a result, Li Wenxuan only delivered two precipitators by February 22, 1951, and another two by July 9. Moreover, three of these four were unusable. Regarding the remaining two, Li Wenxuan claimed that he could not deliver them indefinitely due to the lack of electric rollers. The Public Health Bureau proposed to impose a penalty, but Li Wenxuan deceitfully claimed to be willing to accept a penalty of 27.26 million yuan and deliver the precipitators by July 31. However, these two precipitators have not been delivered to this day.

At the end of December 1950, the Beijing Railway Branch Hospital of the Tianjin Railway Administration ordered and purchased a batch of medical equipment from the "Tianmin Medical Equipment Factory." A batch of goods was to be delivered on December 30. At that time, Li Wenxuan delivered a batch of unsuitable syringes, obstetrical forceps, etc. (which was not discovered at the time). The Beijing Railway Branch Hospital paid Li Wenxuan the full loan of 110 million yuan for all orders on December 31. Among them, goods worth more than 40 million yuan should have been delivered by March 1951 according to the contract. A penalty of 20% would be imposed for late delivery. Li Wenxuan deliberately deceived them, changing the penalty amount from 20% to 2% when writing the contract. Some of the goods delivered within a month after signing the contract were unusable. For example, an electric refrigerator would sell for 30 to 40 million yuan if new, and more than 10 million yuan even if used. Li Wenxuan deliberately priced it at only 8.5 million yuan. However, after the refrigerator was delivered to the hospital, the refrigerant pipe burst, revealing that it was full of old materials. In mid-January 1951, Li Wenxuan even took the loan to Hong Kong for speculative business, not returning to Beijing until March. During Li Wenxuan's absence in Hong Kong, the "Tianmin Medical Equipment Factory" claimed that there was no one in charge of the factory, production was suspended, and they refused to deliver the goods. The goods ordered by the Beijing Railway Branch Hospital were only 80% delivered by the end of December 1951, and there are still more than 20 million yuan worth of orders undelivered. The goods that have been delivered are all cobbled-together scrap.

Li Wenxuan also borrowed money from the People's Bank nine times under the pretext of manufacturing medical equipment needed for the Korean front, and still owes the People's Bank 350 million yuan. In addition, he also took orders from the Shanxi Workers' Hospital, the Health Department of the North China Military Region, the Tianjin North China Textile Administration Bureau, and the Beijing Public Security Hospital. After receiving the money, he failed to fulfill the contract and deliver the goods on time.

The workers of the "Tianmin Medical Equipment Factory" had long been very dissatisfied with Li Wenxuan's fraudulent behavior and had repeatedly advised him to be worthy of the people's own government and do business honestly. The funds should be used for their intended purpose and not diverted for other uses that would delay work. Li Wenxuan completely ignored these opinions. Usually, Li Wenxuan used the funds from the orders of various organizations to live a life of extravagance, but he did not care about the lives of the workers. For more than a year, not only had there been no salary adjustments, but wages were often two or three months in arrears.

After the Beijing business community launched the anti-bribery and anti-fraud struggle, the workers mobilized Li Wenxuan to confess his illegal activities. He flatly denied it and held a secret meeting with several trusted employees to plan an escape from this movement. The Beijing Savings and Inspection Committee had already received accusations, investigated his various criminal facts, and reported to the Beijing Municipal People's Government. The Beijing Municipal People's Government detained him and established a temporary committee of relevant units to sort out and take custody of Li Wenxuan's defrauded state property, preparing to return it to the state.

    用欺诈手段盗骗国家财产二十多亿元
    北京市奸商李文轩已被扣押即将法办
    北京市私营天民医疗器械厂经理李文轩，一贯投机倒把，偷税漏税，盗骗国家资财。被他诈骗的国家财产，仅就已经查出的，就有二十多亿元。现李文轩已被北京市人民政府逮捕。
    李文轩原是一个毒品犯，他在敌伪统治时期，勾结敌伪爪牙，作福作威。解放后，李文轩继续为非作恶。他在太原刚解放时，曾行贿一亿四千万元，盗买了太原卫生处一仓库医药器材，分运北京、天津和上海暗中拍卖。这一批器材估计总值不下二十亿元。
    李文轩以“天民医疗器械厂”做招牌，到处招摇撞骗，承做货品。他骗得货款后，就采取拖赖的办法，从不按期交货；他交的货品，大都是东拼西凑而成，不能使用。一九五○年十月十七日，北京市公共卫生局向“天民医疗器械厂”订购电器远心沉淀器六台，约定两个月交货，并先把全部货款付清。李文轩把货款拿去做投机生意，到期连一台沉淀器也没有交出。李文轩又以诡诈的办法和公共卫生局从新订约，约定如果到十二月十七日还不交货，每天罚款相当货品总值的百分之二；到一九五一年二月二十日还不交货，每日罚款总值的百分之一。结果是直到一九五一年二月二十二日李文轩才交出两台沉淀器，七月九日又交出两台。而且，这四台里面有三台不能用。其余两台，李文轩藉口没有电滚，说是交货无期。公共卫生局提出要罚款，李文轩诡称愿受罚二千七百二十六万元。沉淀器在七月三十一日前交清。但是，直到现在这两台沉淀器也还没有交出。
        一九五○年十二月底，天津铁路管理局北京铁路分局医院向“天民医疗器械厂”订购和现购一批医疗器械。十二月三十日应交付一部现货。当时李文轩交出的是一批不适用的注射器、产钳子等（当时没有被发觉）。北京铁路分局医院把全部订货的贷款一亿一千万元，在十二月三十一日一次付给了李文轩。其中有四千多万元的货物按合同规定应该在一九五一年三月交齐。过期不交时罚款百分之二十。李文轩蓄意欺骗，在写合同的时候，就把罚款额百分之二十写成百分之二。订合同后一个月内所交的订货中，有些货品是不能用的。如其中电气冰箱一只，按市价新的要卖三、四千万元，旧的也要卖一千多万元。李文轩故意只作价八百五十万元。但是冰箱送医院后，冷气管爆破，发现里面全是旧料。一九五一年一月中旬，李文轩竟携贷款去香港做投机生意，直到三月才回北京。李文轩去香港期间，“天民医疗器械厂”厂方推称工厂无人负责，生产停顿，不肯交货。北京铁路分局医院定购的货品，直到一九五一年十二月底，李文轩才交出百分之八十，至今还有二千多万元的定货没有交出。已交的货品也全是拼凑成的废品。
    李文轩又曾假借制造朝鲜前线所需用的军医器械等为理由，向人民银行贷款九次，到现在还拖欠人民银行三亿五千万元。此外，他还承接过山西工人医院、华北军区卫生部、天津华北纺织管理局、北京市公安医院等单位的定货。领款后都没有履行合同，按期交货。
    “天民医疗器械厂”的工人，对于李文轩这种诈骗行为早已十分不满，曾多次劝告他要对得起人民自己的政府，老老实实地做生意。专款要专用，不要随便拉用误工。李文轩根本不理这些意见。平时，李文轩用各机关定货的款项，过着花天酒地的生活，却不管工人的死活。一年多来不但没有调整过一次工资，而且常常拖欠工资两三个月。
    北京市工商界开展反行贿、反欺诈斗争以后，工人动员李文轩坦白自己的违法行为。他一口否认；并且和几个亲信职员开了一个秘密会议，计划逃避这个运动。北京市节约检查委员会早已接到控告，调查了他的种种犯罪事实，报告北京市人民政府。北京市人民政府就把他扣押起来，并由有关单位成立临时委员会清理保管李文轩诈骗国家的财产，准备归还国家。
