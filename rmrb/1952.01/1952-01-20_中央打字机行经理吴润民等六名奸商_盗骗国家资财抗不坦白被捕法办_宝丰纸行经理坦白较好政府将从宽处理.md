    [This newspaper report] According to the Beijing News Agency: The Beijing Savings Inspection Committee has re-started a large-scale inspection of bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state assets among industrial and commercial circles since yesterday (the 19th). The People's Government has arrested six unscrupulous merchants, including Wu Runmin and Zhang Jingfan, who refused to confess during the previous stage of inspection. At the same time, for Bian Lanpo, manager of Baofeng Paper Company, who confessed more thoroughly during the inspection, the People's Government has decided to release him on bail pending further handling, without arrest.

    The six unscrupulous merchants who were arrested for refusing to confess are: Wu Runmin, manager of the Central Typewriter Company; Zhang Jingfan, manager of Mingchang Photographic Materials Company; Shao Yizhai, manager of Dongjicheng Grain Store; Yang Zhenqi, manager of Heyuantai Hardware Store; Tian Yucheng, manager of Taihe Pharmacy; and Liu Chunxu, manager of Jusheng Boiler Factory. Wu Runmin and the other six criminals have consistently colluded with cadres through various despicable means, stealing and defrauding state assets and evading huge amounts of taxes, and their crimes are serious. After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, these criminals not only did not confess their illegal acts but also tried their best to undermine the movement; during the inspection, they continued to deny their crimes cunningly, attempting to muddle through. Even during the three days when the Municipal Savings Inspection Committee temporarily suspended inspections after the fourth extension of the confession deadline for industrial and commercial circles, these criminals still showed no intention of repentance and refused to confess. Therefore, the Municipal People's Government decided to arrest them and bring them to justice.

    Wu Runmin, manager of the Central Typewriter Company, engaged in off-the-books illegal activities through methods such as "consignment sales," smuggling, issuing false invoices, and forging seals. It has been verified that he bribed government workers with up to 20 million yuan. According to incomplete statistics, tax evasion has reached more than 910 million yuan; in addition, there are still large quantities of materials that have not been recorded. When the inspection team went to the company to inspect, he even instructed the shop assistants to bury his many false documents and thirteen fake seals and other evidence in the coal pile.

    Zhang Jingfan, manager of Mingchang Photographic Materials Company, only had 50 million yuan in capital when he opened in November 1950. In the past year, Zhang committed tax evasion and stole state assets through illegal means such as bartering, buying cheap and selling dear in transactions with public entities, not recording purchases and sales, and not issuing invoices. In October 1951, the criminal purchased a batch of photographic materials from a military organ at a low price and made a huge profit of over 1 billion yuan. According to the criminal’s books alone, tax evasion amounted to more than 360 million yuan in one year. In order to achieve the goal of seizing state assets, the criminal consistently seduced cadres with despicable means such as "sending cameras," "giving kickbacks," "lending money," and "free film development," bribing dozens of people successively. After the launch of this movement, the criminal not only did not confess himself but also gave the shop assistants a large amount of money in the name of "year-end bonus," attempting to buy off the shop assistants and muddle through.

    Shao Yizhai, manager of Dongjicheng Grain Store, colluded with and bought off six weighers from the grain company, stealing at least 16,000 jin of state grain that has been verified; stealing labor and materials when processing grain for the public, stealing state wealth of more than 6.6 million yuan; bribing a cadre from the Qinghe Brigade with 1,000 jin of corn, and making a huge profit of more than 20.05 million yuan in transactions with the brigade; also evading more than 18 million yuan in taxes. After the movement began, Shao also convened three meetings of the shop assistants, attempting to buy them off, and intimidated outside runners and accountants to obstruct whistleblowing. When the grain company stopped allocating grain to the store, Shao knew that his crimes had been discovered by others, so he colluded with the accountant and the outside runners to play deceptive tricks; Shao Yizhai pretended to confess in the morning, and the accountant and the outside runners went to make false accusations in the afternoon, attempting to deceive the government with a trick to avoid the important and dwell on the trivial. When the inspection team went there to inspect, he still refused to confess, hid the books, and resisted inspection.

    Yang Zhenqi, manager of Heyuantai Hardware Store, bribed cadres from units such as the Central Government Directly Subordinate Construction Office with more than 45 million yuan. When the criminal delivered goods to the public, he replaced good with bad and new with old, causing great losses to the state. The criminal also evaded a large amount of taxes, amounting to more than 220 million yuan, and repeatedly resold gold, which has now been found to be more than 100 taels. When the inspection team went to the company to inspect, Yang Zhenqi was extremely stubborn and cunning, and after talking and talking, he still refused to thoroughly confess his crimes.

    Tian Yucheng, manager of Taihe Pharmacy, used various despicable means to seduce organ cadres and steal state assets. It has now been found that he has bribed more than 50 million yuan in total. He also used methods such as making false accounts and reporting wholesale business as retail business to evade taxes. Preliminary statistics show that tax evasion amounts to more than 138 million yuan. After the start of this movement, Tian Yucheng attempted to resist the movement, found bribed cadres to form a "defense alliance," and destroyed accounts to cover up his crimes.

    Liu Chunxu, manager of Jusheng Boiler Factory, in order to make huge profits, has been found to have bribed more than 20 cadres, with a total amount of more than 60 million yuan. The criminal Liu stole labor and materials in undertaking public orders, delivered goods late, and stole more than 470 million yuan of state assets. The criminal Liu also privately carved seals, forged documents, and privately withdrew more than 200 million yuan of funds, of which more than 160 million yuan has been found to be used to resell gold. The criminal Liu evaded taxes of 90 million yuan by underreporting turnover and tax rates. The criminal Liu also illegally raised prices and obtained a huge profit of more than 68 million yuan. During the inspection, the criminal Liu was always cunning and refused to tell the truth.

    Bian Lanpo, manager of Baofeng Paper Company, will be treated leniently by the government. He has successively bribed cadres from department stores, the People's Bank, and various state-owned printing factories that have dealings with Baofeng. He also used various illegal means such as fake accounts and conducting wholesale business as retail business to evade more than 200 million yuan in state taxes. After the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles was launched, Bian Lanpo underwent fierce ideological struggles. From January 5th, he began to confess his illegal acts such as bribery and tax evasion to the Federation of Industry and Commerce. Later, as the movement became increasingly high-pitched, he successively confessed problems, and by the 13th, he had confessed a total of 21 items. When the inspection team went to the company to inspect on the 14th of this month, Bian Lanpo also submitted a confession on the spot, handing over four false accounts, and admitted the heinous and shameful nature of his behavior, expressing his determination to thoroughly confess, repent, and start anew. The mistakes made by Bian Lanpo are serious, but because he is still willing to confess, the Municipal People's Government has ordered him to be released on bail pending further handling without arrest. It is reported that the government will treat him leniently. (Qi Ren)

    中央打字机行经理吴润民等六名奸商
    盗骗国家资财抗不坦白被捕法办
    宝丰纸行经理坦白较好政府将从宽处理
    【本报讯】据北京市新闻处讯：北京市节约检查委员会自昨（十九）日起重新开始大规模检查工商界中的行贿、偷税、盗骗国家资财等不法行为后，人民政府又逮捕了在前一阶段检查时拒不坦白的奸商吴润民、张景繁等六人。同时，对于在检查时坦白较彻底的宝丰纸行经理边岚坡，人民政府已决定令其取保听候处理，未予逮捕。
    被逮捕的六个拒不坦白的奸商是：中央打字机行经理吴润民、明昌照像材料行经理张景繁、东集成粮店经理邵义斋、和远泰五金行经理杨振起、太和药房经理田玉成、聚盛汽炉厂经理刘春旭。吴润民等六犯一贯以各种卑鄙手段勾结干部，盗骗国家资财、偷漏巨额税款，罪行严重。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开后，该犯等不但不坦白交代自己的不法行为，还百般破坏运动；在检查时，仍然狡猾抵赖，企图蒙混。直至市节约检查委员会对工商界第四次展延坦白期限暂停检查的三天中，该犯等仍毫无悔过自新之意，拒不坦白。因此，市人民政府决定将该犯等逮捕法办。
    中央打字机行经理吴润民以“代销”、走私、开假发票、刻假图章等方法，进行账外非法活动，已查明者向政府工作人员行贿已达两千万元，据不完全统计，漏税已达九亿一千多万元；此外，还有大批物资未入账。当检查组到该行检查时，他竟指使店员把他的许多假单据、十三个假图章等罪证埋藏在煤堆里面。
    明昌照像材料行经理张景繁，在一九五○年十一月开业时，资本才五千万元。一年来，张犯用以货易货、与公家交易时贱买贵卖、进销货不登账、不开发货票等非法方式，偷漏国家巨额税款，盗骗国家资财。一九五一年十月，该犯以贱价自某军事机关购进一批照像材料，即获暴利十亿元以上。仅按照该犯账面计算，一年中就漏税达三亿六千多万元。为了达到攫取国家资财的目的，该犯一贯以“送像机”、“给回扣”、“借钱”、“免费冲洗像片”等卑鄙手段勾引干部，计先后贿赂了数十人。这次运动展开后，该犯不但自己不坦白，还曾以“年终奖金”名义给店员大量的钱，企图收买店员，蒙混过去。
    东集成粮店经理邵义斋，勾引收买粮食公司过磅员六人，盗窃国家粮食已查明至少有一万六千多斤；代公家做粮食加工时偷工减料，盗窃国家财富六百六十多万元；向清河大队一干部行贿玉米一千斤，在与该部进行交易时，获取暴利两千零五十多万元；另外还偷漏税款一千八百多万元。运动开始后，邵犯还召集店员开过三次会，企图收买店员，还威吓跑外、会计人员阻挠检举。当粮食公司停止向该店拨粮时，邵犯知道自己罪行已被别人发觉，就和会计、跑外人员，串通一气耍欺骗手段；邵义斋上午假坦白，会计、跑外下午去假检举，企图以避重就轻的伎俩蒙蔽政府。在检查组到他那里检查时，他还拒不坦白，把账目藏起来，抗拒检查。
    和远泰五金行经理杨振起，仅向中直修建办事处等单位的干部行贿即达四千五百多万元。该犯向公家交货时，以坏顶好，以旧顶新，使国家遭受很大损失。该犯又大量偷税，数达两亿二千多万元，并多次捣卖黄金，据现在查出的，即达一百多两，当检查组到该行检查时，扬振起异常顽强狡猾，谈来谈去还是始终不肯彻底坦白自己的罪行。
    太和药房经理田玉成，用各种卑鄙手段勾引机关干部，盗骗国家资财。现已查出他先后共行贿五千多万元。他还用造假账、以座商报行商等办法偷税，初步统计偷漏税款达一亿三千八百多万元。此次运动开始后，田玉成妄想抵抗运动，找受贿干部订立“攻守同盟”，并销毁账目，掩盖罪行。
    聚盛汽炉厂经理刘春旭，为图暴利，已查出曾向二十多个干部行贿，贿款总数达六千多万元。刘犯在承做公家定货中，偷工减料，交货误期，从中盗骗国家资财四亿七千多万元。刘犯又私刻图章，伪造单据，私下抽出资金两亿多元，其中已查明用以捣卖黄金的就有一亿六千多万元。刘犯以少报流水，少报税率等方式，偷税九千万元。刘犯并非法提高货价，获取了暴利六千八百多万。在检查中，刘犯始终狡猾，坚不吐实。
    政府将从宽处理的有宝丰纸行经理边岚坡，他曾先后向百货公司、人民银行以及和宝丰有往来的各公营印刷厂干部行贿。他还利用假户头、以座商进行行商活动等多种非法手段，偷漏国家税款达两亿多元。北京市工商界反贪污、反行贿运动展开后，边岚坡思想上起了激烈的斗争，由一月五日起即开始向工商联交代他行贿偷税等不法行为。后来在运动日益高涨的情势下，他曾陆续交代问题，到十三日一共交代出二十一件。当本月十四日检查组到该行检查时，边岚坡又当场交出坦白材料一份，先后交出假账四本，并承认了自己行为的恶劣可耻，表示决彻底坦白，悔过自新。边岚坡所犯的错误是严重的，但因还肯坦白，市人民政府已令其具保听候处理未予逮捕。闻政府将从宽处理。　（齐仁）
