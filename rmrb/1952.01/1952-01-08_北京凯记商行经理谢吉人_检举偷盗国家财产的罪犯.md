    Xie Jiren, Manager of Beijing Kaiji Trading Company,
    Exposes Criminals Stealing State Property
    Xie Jiren, manager of Beijing Kaiji Trading Company in Beijing, voluntarily exposed Zhang Jinrui, who stole state property. Xie Jiren should be commended. Zhang Jinrui is a student at the Beijing Medical School. He used a magnifying glass bought from a stall to exchange for the oil immersion lens of the Zeiss microscope and the eyepiece of the Olympus microscope from the school. At around 2:00 PM on December 2nd of last year, Zhang Jinrui took the stolen microscope lenses to Kaiji Trading Company at No. 16 Nanguawashi Street, Xisi, to sell them, asking for 1.5 million yuan. Xie Jiren, the manager of Kaiji Trading Company, saw that the lenses were good but the price was very low, and suspected the source was questionable, so he asked Zhang Jinrui for proof and his household registration booklet. Zhang Jinrui was flustered and evasive. Xie Jiren reported this to the local public security police station, and the police station sent someone to take Zhang Jinrui away. Zhang Jinrui initially argued that he bought them from a stall, but after on-site investigation, it was proven that Zhang Jinrui had only bought a magnifying glass from a stall. Faced with the ironclad facts, Zhang Jinrui confessed his guilt. The criminal Zhang has been sentenced to one year of imprisonment.
    It is correct for Xie Jiren, the manager of Kaiji Trading Company, to boldly expose thieves. In the vigorous movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, all businesses should learn from him and expose criminals who steal state property, in order to eliminate all ugly and shameful acts of stealing state property.

    北京凯记商行经理谢吉人
    检举偷盗国家财产的罪犯
    北京市凯记商行经理谢吉人自动检举盗窃国家财产犯张金瑞。谢吉人应该受到表扬。张金瑞是北京医士学校的学员。他用从小摊上买的扩大镜，换了学校的持亚西马牌显微镜的油镜头及欧伦帕斯牌显微镜的接目镜。去年十二月二日下午二时左右，张金瑞拿着偷窃的显微镜头，到西四南缸瓦市大街十六号凯记商行出售，索价一百五十万元。凯记商行经理谢吉人见镜头很好，但要价很低，认为来源可疑，就向张金瑞索取证明和户口单。张金瑞张皇失措，言语支吾。谢吉人就到当地公安派出所报告，由派出所派人把张金瑞带走。张金瑞最初还狡辩是从小摊上买的，经实地调查，证明张金瑞只在小摊上买过一个扩大镜。在铁一般的事实面前，张金瑞才低头认罪。张犯已被判处徒刑一年。
    凯记商行经理谢吉人大胆检举盗窃分子，是正确的。在大张旗鼓地反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的运动中，一切商家都应该向他学习，检举偷盗国家财产的罪犯，以肃清一切丑恶的可耻的盗窃国家财产的行为。    中央卫生部节约检查委员会
