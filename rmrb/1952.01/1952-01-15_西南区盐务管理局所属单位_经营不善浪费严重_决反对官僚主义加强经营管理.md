    Southwest District Salt Affairs Bureau Affiliated Units
    Suffer from Poor Management and Serious Waste
    Resolutely Oppose Bureaucratism and Strengthen Business Management
    The Southwest District Salt Affairs Bureau has preliminarily inspected the salt production and sales of its affiliated units in 1951 and found that serious waste has been caused due to poor management.
    Many well and stove facilities under the Southwest District Salt Affairs departments have accumulated large quantities of materials. For example, the four factories under the state-owned Xinhua Salt Factory in Southern Sichuan discovered a large backlog of equipment during asset inventory. The Yunnan Yipinglang State-owned Salt Factory only focused on the quantity of products, neglecting quality, resulting in a backlog of 70,000 dan of substandard salt in the warehouse. In terms of operations, capital accumulation was also severe. Allocations in the past were not based on actual needs. For example, in early November 1951, capital accumulation in the entire district accounted for 50% of the total capital allocated. The Sichuan Southern Public-Private Jointly Operated Limin Salt Factory requested funds from higher authorities, but its branch factories often had hundreds of millions of yuan in funds unused.
    The phenomenon of overlapping organizations and overstaffing within the Southwest District Salt Affairs Bureau's affiliated organizations is also very serious. Some distribution offices have not been staffed according to fixed quotas, and the ratio of direct production workers to administrative management personnel in some well and stove facilities is unreasonable. At the Xinhua Salt Factory No. 2 in Southern Sichuan, direct production workers accounted for 46%, while non-production personnel accounted for 54%. This not only wastes human and financial resources but also weakens work efficiency.
    Waste in capital construction is also very serious in the various departments affiliated with this bureau. In the past, factories received as much as they requested in their plans. When the Sichuan Southern Public-Private Jointly Operated Water Transport Company built a reservoir, it did not receive funds in installments according to the progress of the project, but received 1 billion yuan at once, which remained idle in the bank for several months. When the Xinhua Salt Factory No. 1 in Southern Sichuan repaired the brine wells, it did not conduct a detailed survey and design but blindly carried out construction, resulting in the waste of 60 million yuan of state assets.
    The reasons for the serious waste phenomenon in the departments affiliated with the Southwest District Salt Affairs Bureau, in addition to insufficient experience and poor management, are mainly due to the serious bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres. The departments affiliated with the Salt Affairs Bureau are now conducting further in-depth inspections and have decided to vigorously oppose bureaucratism, strengthen business management, strictly control capital construction plans, and further reorganize the organization in the future. At the same time, they will also thoroughly clean up warehouses, manage their affairs well, resolutely implement the budget and final account system, and oppose corruption and waste. (Yu)

    西南区盐务管理局所属单位
    经营不善浪费严重
    决反对官僚主义加强经营管理
    西南区盐务管理局初步检查所属单位一九五一年食盐生产和运销情况，发现因经营不善，造成了严重的浪费。
    西南区盐务部门，许多井灶曾积压大批物资。如川南国营新华制盐厂所属四个厂，在清理资产中，查出积压器材很多。云南一平浪国营制盐厂，只注意产品数量，忽视质量，积压在仓库内的不合规格的盐斤有七万担。在经营上，积压资金也很严重。过去拨款不根据实际需要，如一九五一年十一月上旬，全区搁压资金占拨出资金总数的百分之五十。川南公私合营利民制盐总厂向上级请拨资金，但它的分厂却经常存着资金几亿元不用。
    西南区盐务管理局所属组织的机构重叠、人浮于事的现象也很严重。有些分销处没有按照定员定额编制，有些井灶直接生产的工人和行政管理人员的比例不合理。川南新华制盐二厂，直接生产的工人占百分之四十六，非生产人员却占百分之五十四。这不但浪费人力、财力，而且削弱了工作效能。
    这个局所属的各部门，在基本建设上浪费也很严重。过去各厂计划要多少就给多少。川南公私合营运水公司修建蓄水池时，没有按照工程进度分期领款，一次就领款十亿元，以致在银行里呆存数月。川南新华制盐一厂，修复卤井时没有经过详细勘查设计，盲目施工，以致浪费国家资财六千万元。
    西南区盐务管理局所属部门产生严重浪费现象的原因，除经验不足，不善经营以外，主要是领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风。盐务管理局所属部门现在正进一步深入进行检查，并决定今后大力反对官僚主义，加强经营管理，严格控制基本建设计划，进一步整编机构。同时，他们还要彻底清理仓库，管好家务，坚决执行预决算制度，反对贪污浪费现象。　（渝）
