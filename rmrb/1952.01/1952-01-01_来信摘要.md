Letter Summary

    Relevant departments should find ways to collect discarded toothpaste tubes
    In the movement to increase production and practice economy, in addition to opposing major waste, we should also pay attention to many small things. For example, many people throw away used toothpaste tubes, which is actually quite wasteful. Our preliminary calculations show that if there are 10 million people using toothpaste across the country, and each person uses an average of one tube every two months, then a total of 5 million tubes of toothpaste are used each month. This means that 5 million old toothpaste tubes are discarded each month. Assuming each toothpaste tube contains 17.8 grams of lead, a total of 89,000 kilograms of lead are wasted, equivalent to 2.225 billion RMB (at 25,000 RMB per kilogram of lead). This is a very alarming figure. We suggest that relevant departments come up with a way to collect toothpaste tubes.

    Nanchang Normal School teachers Ma Xixian and others use old materials to make microscopes
    Last semester, our Jiangxi Provincial Nanchang Normal School did not have microscopes, which caused many difficulties in experimental work. To overcome this difficulty, physics teacher Ma Xixian and labor teacher Wan Renjie, under the encouragement of the Party organization, the Department of Culture and Education, and the Trade Union, after repeated experiments, used four brass magnifying glasses and other materials (totaling 90,000 RMB) to make two 50x microscopes, saving more than 2 million RMB for the country. I think that the spirit of teacher Ma Xixian and others in using old materials to overcome difficulties is worthy of learning by teachers in all schools.

    Yuan Jizhan and others collect waste iron nails worth more than 3.4 million RMB
    Recently, the China National Import and Export Corporation and the China Import Corporation jointly built an office building in Zhuanta Hutong, Xicheng, Beijing. Yuan Jizhan, Jia Long, and other nine comrades who were working as security guards during the construction, in order to respond to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, in addition to fulfilling their security tasks for the construction area, also launched a movement to collect waste iron nails from the ash and soil under the leadership of Communist Party member Yuan Jizhan. In the two months from October 2nd to December 5th of last year, they collected a total of 868 jin of iron nails, sold them for more than 3.4 million RMB, and donated all the money to purchase airplanes and cannons.

    来信摘要
    有关部门应设法收集废牙膏管子
    在增产节约运动中，除了应该反对大的浪费外，还应注意许多小事。比如许多人都把用过的牙膏管子丢掉，这实在也是不少的浪费。我们初步计算了一下，假定全国有一千万人使用牙膏，每人平均两个月用一支，则每月共用牙膏五百万支。这样，每个月就有五百万支旧牙膏管子被丢掉。以每支牙膏管含铅量十七点八克来算，共浪费铅八万九千公斤，折合人民币二十二亿二千五百万元（每公斤铅二万五千元）。这是一个非常惊人的数字。我们建议有关部门，想出一个收集牙膏管子的办法来。

    南昌师范教师马希贤等利用旧材料制成显微镜
    上学期我们江西省立南昌师范没有显微镜，使实验工作发生了不少困难。为了克服这个困难，物理科教师马希贤和劳作科教师万人杰，在党的组织、文教厅和工会的鼓励下，经过一次又一次的试验，用四个黄铜三脚扩大镜和其他材料（合人民币九万元），制成二个五十倍的显微镜，为祖国节约了二百多万元。我认为马希贤教师等这种利用旧材料，克服困难的精神，值得各学校的教师学习。

    苑吉旃等拣拾价值三百四十多万元的废铁钉
    最近，中国进出口公司和中国进口公司在北京西城砖塔胡同合建办公室一座。在建筑中担任警卫工作的苑吉旃、贾龙等九位同志，为了响应毛主席关于增产节约的号召，除了很好地担负起保卫施工地区的安全任务外，并在共产党员苑吉旃同志带领下，发起了在灰土中拣拾废铁钉运动。自去年十月二日至十二月五日的两个月中，共拣拾铁钉八百六十八斤，售款三百四十多万元，全部献出，购买飞机大炮。
