I do not think it is possible to agree with the arguments that have been made here to defend a proposal that calls for postponing the debate on the issue that we are currently discussing here as a motion.

First, we still don't know what you want from us.

You keep repeating the same sentence here: postpone the discussion of the Korean question. But for how long do you propose to postpone the discussion of this question?

Syrian representative Mr. El-Khouri said: indefinitely. Indefinitely means not specifying a date, not specifying a time; that is to say, postponing it without end.

On the other hand, others say that it is not postponing it without end, but postponing it "temporarily"; but what does this "temporarily" mean? They cannot, or rather, they dare not, explain it.

So, what is the mystery here? If the adult gentlemen who launched this war are afraid to discuss any issue, even an issue that does not directly touch on the war, but in any case involves the hostilities in a country whose peace has been forcibly disrupted by foreign interventionists—if that is the case, then obviously things are very bad for them.

Obviously, you want to, as the saying goes, "put a stop" to this issue. First, you want to generally say "postpone" without specifying how long to postpone it, so that since no time limit is specified, that is, you are not willing to specify a time at all, because, you know, the deadline for postponement has not been stipulated. We have had a precedent similar to this situation on the issue of forcing the Secretary-General to be re-elected, which must be said to be disgraceful. Whenever there is a question of a deadline, all kinds of conspiracies will appear; we have seen these conspiracies a long time ago.

I think that on this issue, some people are starting some kind of, I would say, overly bold adventure. Therefore, the Soviet delegation firmly demands that, regardless of all arguments for or against, Mr. Gross's proposal should be made more specific. It is necessary, regardless of everything, to make this proposal more specific.

I ask you to clarify to us: are you planning to postpone the discussion on the issue of Korean independence indefinitely—or, in Mr. El-Khouri's words, indefinitely—or are you postponing it until a certain period? If there is a certain period, then tell us, how long will it be postponed? This is our legitimate request, our legitimate demand. Without making this request, it is impossible to resolve this issue wisely.

The second situation that I would like to draw everyone's attention to is the following:

Some people have said here: as long as the Korean War is still going on, the discussion of the current issue should be postponed indefinitely; we cannot agree with this argument. Of course, it is undeniable that even if we do not discuss the military aspect of this issue—we are not suggesting discussing the military aspect of this issue, because we are adhering to the agenda, which contains the issue of Korean independence—the issue of Korean independence is naturally related to the issue of hostilities in Korea. But this is not the whole issue, so to what extent we consider the whole issue depends on how we decide.

Some people say that if any issue related to the hostilities in Korea is brought up for discussion, it may be harmful to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. These people are actually afraid that this discussion will promote the cessation of these hostilities, because this is unfavorable to those who profit from the war, and it is beneficial for them to continue the hostilities.

However, some people tell us: these issues must never be touched. They say: if the United Nations General Assembly discusses these issues, it may hinder the smooth progress of the Korean negotiations. This is a strange logic—the word "strange" is still used too lightly. What are we doing here? Everyone knows that the United Nations Organization was established as a tool for peace. The United Nations Charter says: the cause of peace is an important responsibility of the United Nations. Many resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly also mention this. Even when I say today that the Security Council has the primary responsibility for the cause of peace (of course it is correct to say so, I am saying the primary responsibility, not the sole responsibility), you also expressed opposition. You said: the entire United Nations Organization, as well as the General Assembly, bear the primary obligations and responsibilities for the cause of peace. I agree with this. But if this is the case, the United Nations General Assembly should of course discuss issues related to the cause of peace, and the current situation of preventing the General Assembly from discussing such issues should of course not be allowed to exist.

The US-British Bloc Obstructs Discussion of Korean Independence Because They Fear the End of the War of Aggression Against Korea

The United Nations General Assembly was established to discuss the issue of peace. It should not only help eliminate threats to peace, but also help eliminate events that have already disrupted peace, and take measures to restore peace that has been disrupted. This is the task of the United Nations and the United Nations General Assembly.

If you say that these issues related to Korean independence and the cessation of hostilities are inseparable, then we do not object to not separating these two issues, although we believe that these two issues can be discussed separately. But I want to repeat that we also see no reason to oppose discussing these two issues at the same time. However, we cannot say that because these two issues cannot be separated, there is no need to study these issues that should be the object of all our work, the object of the United Nations' activities and existence.

You say that the Security Council is not competent, so it is necessary to create a situation so that the United Nations will not be helpless when peace is threatened. Therefore, you advocate violating the Charter and handing over the powers that should belong to the Security Council to the United Nations General Assembly.

Now, when we have agreed to discuss the issue of Korean independence by the United Nations General Assembly (this discussion may help strengthen peace), some people tell us: "No, as long as the war in Korea is still going on, we will not discuss this issue." Why? "Because this will hinder the progress of things." But what does "hinder the progress of things" mean? Hinder the smooth progress of the war, or hinder the smooth conclusion of the armistice negotiations? You say: "Hinder the smooth progress of the armistice negotiations." However, it is simply impossible for people to understand what relationship this issue has with the issue of Korean independence! It is simply impossible to understand: helping the smooth conclusion of the armistice negotiations, or setting tasks and goals for ourselves to help the smooth conclusion of the armistice negotiations, why can it be said that it may lead to the breakdown of the negotiations. What is the problem here? There are some absolutely unbelievable things here! It seems that the more we try to stop the war, the more intense the war will become. On the other hand, it seems that the less we try to stop the war, the faster the war will ease, and the sooner it will end—in the final analysis, this is all the reasoning of our opponents on this issue. This argument is not worth refuting.

Therefore, we cannot agree with this logic that some people have put forward to us here. Later, we will also talk about the real reasons why certain delegations, especially the US delegation, are so unwilling to discuss this issue and so eagerly hope to postpone the debate on this issue, and what we believe are the real reasons.

Some people told us: "We are not sure whether such a discussion will necessarily be fruitful." But if the task of discussing any general issue has not been correctly understood, if this discussion is not carried out correctly, then how can it be determined before actually discussing these issues whether any general discussion or discussion of any general issue will be fruitful?

Are only those issues that ordinary people believe will surely produce beneficial results can be put on the agenda? If so, then it must first be explained what is a beneficial result. For example, we believe that the sponsors of the eleven-nation delegation proposal would believe that yesterday's vote and the entire debate have brought them positive results; but we believe that the debate and vote on this issue is a complete failure for the entire US plan of so-called "collective measures." On the other hand, from our point of view, the failure of this US plan is a "beneficial result," because the United States and its Atlantic Group partners did not achieve their goals, and this goal is contrary to the purposes of the United Nations and is a threat to the cause of peace. It should be remembered that there are different attitudes and different opinions when discussing this issue. Therefore, it cannot be decided whether the discussion is fruitful until facts have proved and life has proved what is beneficial and what is not beneficial.

Therefore, the argument that the discussion is "fruitful" or "unfruitful" is unconvincing. The argument that refuses to discuss the issues of a certain country at the scheduled time is unconvincing. All the reasons put forward to defend this erroneous attitude are untenable. The crux of the problem is not here at all. The crux of the problem is that the United States and its supporters are afraid that once we discuss this issue, all their plans for Korea will be exposed to sound, honest, and fair criticism, so that this plan will become fragmented like rotten cloth. You are afraid of this! No matter how much the gentlemen of your Atlantic Group member states brag, no matter how arrogant you are, we say that you cannot hide your fear. You are afraid that people will further expose your piratical war against the Korean people! You are afraid of being exposed. However, what you are afraid of is not just being exposed. You are afraid of the end of the war, as we have seen from the "Wall Street Journal," and many American leaders and American newspapers have also publicly said so.

Some people say: it is necessary to wait for this issue to be resolved by force or by peaceful means. Mr. El-Khouri also said this, which surprised me very much.

Some people are holding weapons—not only holding weapons, but also taking armed actions, causing the residents of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to suffer from the brutal and barbaric bombing by US aircraft, and this is still happening while the armistice negotiations are taking place in Panmunjom! In this case, what peaceful means are there to speak of!

On the day before Christmas, US aircraft flew more than 600 sorties within 24 hours, and this was of course carried out under the banner and in the name of the United Nations.

Some people say: "Wait a while, let this issue be resolved in the Korean negotiations, our interference will only be harmful!" But the negotiations are not going well and are very unsatisfactory. The French representative said: "The negotiations have difficulties." The British representative said: "No, there is progress." The US representative also said: "There is progress." But we want to say: there are not only difficulties, but also unimaginable difficulties. Therefore, when they mention the Korean negotiations and oppose the United Nations' "interference"—this is in their words—they are only showing that they hope to resolve the issue of the cessation of hostilities by force. Then, what is the purpose of the negotiations? In this case, what is the purpose of these negotiations to achieve? Obviously, the US side is using these negotiations to cover up their own claims and wishes to resolve the Korean War by force. But they seem to forget that weapons will not always be useful to only one side, weapons are useful to both sides. Is this issue unrelated to our organization—"the tool of peace"? What is our organization after all, a tool of peace, although we have heard some delegations here talk about their absurd "theories." Some delegations here said that the United Nations should not be involved in this issue, it should let the blood flow in Korea, it should let the cities and villages continue to be burned and destroyed, let millions of people—women, children, and the elderly—continue to die, and young people should be sent there to die in confusion far away from their homes. Should the member states of the United Nations say such things? Should the United Nations Organization think and do this? No! This is a shameful attitude, this is an attitude of shirking our responsibilities.

The So-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" Is Just an Affiliated Agency of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff

Some people, such as the representative of Peru, have said here that the issue of peace in the Far East should be left to those who should handle this matter to resolve. But, Mr. Peruvian representative, the whole difficulty now lies in the fact that those who can resolve the issue of peace in the Far East are not handling this matter, but are engaged in war. You say: let them handle this matter, they should handle this matter. That is to say, Ridgway and the US military should handle the matter of deciding peace, and we the United Nations should not discuss the issue of peace. Let Ridgway handle this matter. In this way, all that is missing is to let General Ridgway serve as the chairman of our General Assembly, and let those who recommend him be his subordinates or followers! This is exactly in line with the plan outlined by Peruvian representative Mr. Belaunde—a plan that some people are eagerly seeking. But the Peruvian representative obviously stood on the wrong side. He did not stand on the side of peace by reasoning like this, but on the side of war, on the side of the war profiteers—that is of course your own business. Some people say: we should not try to solve problems that cannot be solved. But, are there "unsolvable problems"? In my opinion, there are no such problems. Problems are always decided by people, problems always depend on people, depending on whether they can solve this kind of problem. Of course, this also depends on the environment and circumstances, but the environment and circumstances are not falling from the sky, but are created by people. In the final analysis, the problem is decided by people. But those who do not discuss, do not analyze, and do not solve these problems will never be able to make any wise decisions.

The Peruvian representative said that we should not "disturb the calm and hinder the success of the Panmunjom negotiations that are seeking to end the war." But what is the calm in Korea that this speaker is talking about? Some people tell us that while the war is going on in Korea, we have nothing to discuss in the Security Council. But this is just repeating the old tune that has been refuted. The Chilean representative has refuted this by saying that the committee established the year before last can discuss many issues about Korea, such as the rehabilitation of Korea and the establishment of a democratic system in Korea. By the way, it should be pointed out that this committee—the Anglo-American bloc refused to discuss its report here—is called the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea." Why don't we listen to its report? In the past, we opposed organizing this committee and pointed out that it would not have any results, it would not have any achievements, it was just a department of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. If you dare to discuss this issue here, we can now prove that these words are true. As you said before, you organized this committee because it can discuss the issue of unifying and rehabilitating Korea. This is related to the issue of Korean independence. Paragraphs 369 and 367 of the committee's report clearly explain this. This committee has done something—we should at least see what it has done in the entire year, this is not without meaning. We would like to see what this committee is doing.

But some people tell us: while the war is going on, don't worry about all this.

This is the whole crux of the various issues that are interrelated with the proposal that is euphemistically called the issue of Korean independence that is being presented to us. Some people tell us: no, you must not worry about all this. We should not say the kind of words that the Philippine representative has even said here. If it were not for the Philippine representative's speech being unreasonable, we would not have to talk about his speech in detail. The Philippine representative here, with his usual slanderous lies against the Soviet Union, raised some very stupid questions to us, some provocative questions: Is the Soviet Union participating in the Korean War? This is one of the series of provocative lies and arbitrary slanders from the "Voice of America." The Philippine representative here has obviously always been directed by the "Voice of America." Let's not talk about these provocative evasions. I just want to say: the part of the Philippine representative's speech that is related to the issue we are discussing is just blatant confirmation that the US bloc is unwilling to end the Korean War.

The UN, An International Organization For Maintaining Peace, Should Stop The US From Obstructing Armistice Talks

Some people tell us, for example, the representative of Uruguay told us: "We (the United Nations—this is how the representative of Uruguay interprets it) have ordered to fight for peace in Korea, and we have no right to take any steps that hinder the execution of this order."

The representative of Uruguay said: "We must not do anything harmful to the headquarters."

In this way, the Korean War has become a war for peace. This is undoubtedly absurd. Does the representative of Uruguay not think that not starting a war or trying to stop it immediately after the war breaks out would be more beneficial to the cause of peace? To say that a war is being waged for peace is very contradictory, like—for example—heat and cold, hard and soft, white and black. The representative of Uruguay obviously felt that it was impolite to put forward this "philosophy" in front of public opinion, and felt that these words were very rude. He quickly added that, of course, it should be properly explained, and it should be declared that refusing to discuss the Korean issue in the committee does not mean—as the representative of Uruguay said—"we do not pay attention to or care about the combatants," this is just "postponing" the discussion, "temporarily postponing" the discussion, and this is entirely because of the hope not to harm the interests of the headquarters.

In what way not to harm the interests of the headquarters—of course, the US headquarters? In the way of armistice negotiations or in the way of war?

If it is in the way of peace negotiations, then we can say to the headquarters: "This is our suggestion. If you adopt this suggestion, you can make the peace negotiations conclude smoothly and quickly." But you are unwilling to do so. This alone very clearly illustrates why those gentlemen who agree with the opinions of the representatives of the United States, Britain, the Philippines, and Uruguay are so strongly opposed to submitting the Korean issue to our committee, the Security Council, and any United Nations organization for discussion.

The agenda for the day is the issue of Korean independence, the issue of Korean rehabilitation. We would very much like to see what this committee is doing, this committee that has obtained money to do things, it relies on our budget for existence, including more than one million US dollars from the Soviet Union. If this committee does nothing, if it is useless, if its uselessness reaches such a degree that its report cannot even be heard or even mentioned here, or if it is doing something harmful, then the following questions must be raised: why are we giving money to this committee, why do we need it? What is going on when those reports are shelved and not discussed when it is necessary to discuss the committee's report? My opinion is contrary to those of my colleagues who generally think that it is not necessary to talk about this report. I want to discuss this report. On this point, I think Mr. Lloyd's actions are right. He wants to find arguments for himself in the committee's report, in the booklet he is holding now. However, he did not find any arguments in his favor there. There are arguments in the report that are contrary to his opinions.

For example, in Section 369 on page 47 of the Russian version of the report, it says that international efforts are needed to provide assistance to Korea.

Perhaps some people will ask: is this correct or not correct? We think this is correct. But if international efforts are needed even in the environment of war, then who, which organization can carry out this international effort? I answer: the United Nations.

Then which agency of the United Nations is it? It is the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly, and the US representative here particularly firmly insists that it is the United Nations General Assembly.

Therefore, international efforts are needed. Of course, the best and foremost international effort is to be carried out by the United Nations, because the United Nations is the only international organization established to maintain peace, to eliminate the danger of war, to oppose aggression that has already occurred and wars that have broken out, and to establish international security. The Security Council and the General Assembly represent the United Nations (you yourselves have recognized this in your "United Action for Peace" case).

But now, when we talk about this matter, you say to us: "Don't mention this matter, don't worry about all these things." Why? I have said, and I will say again, the reason is: if we mention the committee's report, analyze the committee's activities, and everything that has happened in Korea for almost two years, then all your "views" and suggestions—all of this, will disintegrate like rotten cloth.

Therefore, some people have put forward the absurd argument that we should not be involved in the Korean situation. They do not engage in "international efforts" and do not take action through international organizations; on the contrary, they want to persuade us that it is best to make international organizations not take action, and it is best not to prevent them.

Who should we not prevent? Ridgway. What should we not prevent? The answer we get is: "Don't prevent him from waging a war for peace." But this is simply absurd! We demand an explanation of what it means if this is not absurd. But we have not received any answer, and we have not received an answer until the end of the discussion on this issue. This is intolerable. The United Nations must express its opinion, and it must never "not prevent General Ridgway," but must point out to him that he must not put forward absurd demands to hinder the armistice negotiations. We want to mention Ridgway's demand for the exchange of prisoners of war as an example of this absurd demand.

Everyone knows that the US military headquarters has more than 170,000 Korean prisoners of war, and the other side has 11,500 American and British prisoners of war.

General Ridgway suggested exchanging prisoners of war according to the one-for-one principle, that is to say: the US military headquarters agreed to repatriate 11,500 Korean prisoners of war and keep 160,000 people as hostages, while the headquarters of the Korean People's Army and the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers had to repatriate all the prisoners of war.

What is this? Does this "principle" not fundamentally violate all international conventions and all the most basic principles of international law related to this? This fundamentally violates all international practices. International law stipulates that prisoners of war are exchanged after the end of the war, and they must not be exchanged according to the one-for-one principle, but according to the principle of all for all, regardless of whether the number of prisoners in the hands of both sides is equal.

Otherwise, we will see an unprecedented situation: the war is over, but citizens of a certain country that has signed a peace armistice agreement are still being held as prisoners by the other side. Therefore, it is very natural and very appropriate for us to express our authoritative opinion on this point. However, some representatives want to prove that the United Nations should stand aside and wait until (as they have said here) the issue of war is resolved on the battlefield.

The Soviet Union Strengthens Opposition to War Profiteers' Propaganda and Does Not Allow the UN to Become a Tool of US Aggression

How can we understand this claim? We can only understand it as follows: this claim means that these representatives agree to discuss the Korean issue after the intervention has ended victoriously and after the US generals believe that there is nothing that will prevent them from obtaining the fruits of their military victory. However, if the things that the interventionists are doing are not going well, like before the negotiations began, those representatives who take this claim will not refuse to discuss the Korean issue within the United Nations. At that time, they will definitely remember the General Assembly, and they will not only definitely not refuse, but they will also demand that the General Assembly intervene in this issue.

At that time, there will be another clamor from those seats of the US-British bloc representatives. They will demand to discuss this issue, demand to condemn the "aggressors," "punish the aggressors," and demand to take emergency "collective measures" to ensure the "security" of the real aggressors. At that time, we will hear the word "peace." But at the same time, these gentlemen will demand that the First Committee not hinder the war. They will say: "Let things develop naturally, let these issues be resolved by war, armed forces, or peace." The peace mentioned here is only a smoke screen, and at the same time, their peace is quite strange—a bit like a bandit who kills, sets fire, punches, kicks, waves a knife, and wields a club….

This is what we cannot agree to. This concept is completely unacceptable: it fundamentally contradicts all the concepts that allow us to sit at the meeting table of the United Nations for discussion, as long as this organization has not finally become a tool of war. Unfortunately: it has already started and is continuing to move along this path. We are doing our best to prevent it from continuing to move along this path and from further falling into this abyss. However, on this issue, just like on other issues, we are unfortunately often in the minority. Our efforts to strengthen the United Nations and make it a tool of peace are being called propaganda. No, this is not propaganda. This is counter-propaganda, propaganda against the propaganda of the war profiteers.

Let me quote the committee's report again. By the way, there are four sections in this report—Sections 68 to 71—all of which are listed under the chapter specifically marked as the scope of the committee's activities. What is the meaning of these sections? It can be clearly seen from Section 71 that the meaning of these sections is nothing more than the following. The meaning of Section 71, when read literally, is this: the main efforts of the United Nations in Korea are temporarily military, and the main task of the committee is to do everything possible to support the military operations of the United Nations armed forces aimed at ensuring the independence of the Republic of Korea. In view of the change in circumstances, the committee has therefore decided that its responsibilities should also be changed. It is very important for us to discuss this issue. How did this United Nations Korean Unification and Rehabilitation Committee become a committee that "does everything possible to support the military operations of the United Nations armed forces" due to the development of the situation? It is very important to clarify this point.

The matter was originally like this: this committee believed that its responsibility was to assist the so-called United Nations armed forces, which are the armed forces of the United States. But there is also another intriguing question, that is, in what ways and with what actions has this committee assisted this kind of military action? Will it continue to provide assistance in the future? According to the report, the committee provided assistance in a way that could ensure that Korea would achieve the goal of independence. The report openly says: ensuring the independence of the Republic of Korea.

This is the most important thing: the committee has fallen to this point. A committee that was created for the explicit purpose of unifying and rehabilitating Korea has had to become an affiliated agency of the Washington Joint Chiefs of Staff and General Ridgway's field headquarters, and has had to regard assisting the military operations of the armed forces of the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, and other countries as its main task.

The so-called United Nations Korean Unification and Rehabilitation Committee has become a department under General Ridgway's headquarters. Its main purpose, as the report says, is to strive to successfully complete the tasks put forward by the war. As the report depicts, it is as if the purpose of the committee's work is to promote the rehabilitation of Korea by assisting the armed forces under the command of US generals. However, what are these armed forces doing to achieve this goal of rehabilitating Korea? They are destroying towns, villages, and killing residents.

Therefore, we believe that those who oppose reviewing the committee's report here are because they are afraid of being exposed, and they are afraid that a public discussion of these issues by the First Committee will disrupt all their plans and mess up their hand of cards. They are afraid of exposing the shameful activities and the shameful results of the so-called Korean Unification and Rehabilitation Committee—this committee that has become General Ridgway's field office. This is the real reason why the delegations of the US and British blocs suddenly—I should say hastily—retreated when they saw that their criminal plans and actions of aggression in Korea were in danger of being completely exposed. They immediately declared a retreat when we talked about the issue of Korean independence, because they themselves also knew that all their false rhetoric about Korean "independence," all the rhetoric that covered up their transformation of Korea into an American colony, would definitely be exposed.

    关于朝鲜问题
    ——维辛斯基一月九日在联合国大会政治委员会上的演说全文
    我认为不能同意有人在这里为了给一个提案辩解而发的议论，这个提案要求延期辩论目前我们正在这里当作议案而加以讨论的问题。
    首先，我们仍然不知道要我们怎么样。
    你们在这里翻来覆去地总是说那一句话：延期讨论朝鲜问题。但是，你们主张延迟多久才讨论这个问题呢？
    叙利亚代表埃尔—古里先生说：无限期。无限期的意思就是不指出日期，不指明时间；这就是说无止境地延期。
    另一方面，别的人又说，不是无止境地延期，而是“暂时”延期；可是这种“暂时”是什么意思呢？他们就不能，或者说得更确切一些，不敢解释了。
    那末，这里面有怎样一种奥妙呢？如果发动这个战争的大人先生们害怕讨论任何问题，甚至害怕讨论这样一种问题，这问题并不直接触及战争，可是无论如何总涉及其和平已经被外国干涉者强行发动的战争破坏了的国家中的敌对行动——如果是这样，那末，显然是事情对他们很不妙了。
    显然，你们是要，就像俗话所说的，“煞住”这个问题。首先，你们想一般地说“延期”，却不指明延迟多久，这样一来，既然没有规定时间，也就是根本不肯规定时间，因为，你们知道，延迟的期限并没有规定下来。我们在那必须说是可耻的强使秘书长连任的问题上，就有过和这种情形相似的先例。每逢遇到期限问题的时候，总会出现种种阴谋；这些阴谋我们早就看过了。
    我想，在这个问题上，也有人正在开始某种，我要说是过于大胆的冒险。因此，苏联代表团坚决要求：不顾一切赞成或反对的议论，使葛罗斯先生的建议提得更明确些。必须不顾一切，使这个建议提得更明确些。
    我要求你们对我们说清楚：你们是打算把关于朝鲜独立问题的讨论无止境地——或者用埃尔—古里先生的说法，无限期地——延搁下去呢，还是推延到一定的期限以后呢？如果有一定的期限，那末，告诉我们，要延搁多久呢？这是我们正当的请求，正当的要求。不提出这种要求，就不可能明智地解决这个问题。
    我愿意提醒大家注意的第二种情况，是下面这种情况：
    有人在这里说：只要朝鲜战争仍在进行，关于目前这个问题的讨论就应该无限期地延搁下去；我们是不能同意这种论调的。当然，不可否认，即使我们不讨论这个问题的军事方面——我们并不是建议讨论这个问题的军事方面，因为我们遵守议程，议程上有着朝鲜独立问题——朝鲜独立问题自然还是和在朝鲜的敌对行动的问题有关的。可是这并不是整个问题，因此，我们要在什么限度上考虑全部问题，就看我们怎样决定了。
    有一些人说，如果把任何和在朝鲜的敌对行动有关的问题都拿来讨论，对于朝鲜的和平解决可能是有害的。这些人其实是害怕这种讨论会促使这种敌对行动停止，因为这是不利于靠战争自肥的人的，敌对行动继续下去才对他们有利。
    但是，有人向我们说：绝不能接触到这些问题。他们说：如果联合国大会讨论这些问题，就可能妨碍朝鲜谈判顺利进展。真是奇怪的道理——奇怪两个字还是用得太轻了。我们这里到底是干什么的呢？谁都知道，联合国组织是建立来作和平的工具的。联合国宪章说：和平事业是联合国的重要责任。联合国大会的许多决议也谈到了这一点。甚至在我今天说安全理事会对和平事业负有主要责任的时候（当然这样说是正确的，我说的是主要责任，而不是唯一的责任），你们也表示反对。你们说：对和平事业负主要义务和责任的，是整个联合国组织，同时也是大会。这一点我同意。但是，如果是这样，联合国大会就当然应该讨论关系到和平事业的问题，像目前这种妨碍大会讨论这类问题的情形当然是不能容许其存在的。
    美英集团害怕侵朝战争结束因而阻挠讨论朝鲜独立问题
    联合国大会之所以成立，是为了讨论和平的问题。它不仅要帮助消除对和平的威胁，而且还要帮助消除已经破坏和平的事件，并且要采取措施恢复已经被破坏的和平。这就是联合国和联合国大会的任务。
    如果你们说，这些有关朝鲜独立的问题和停止敌对行动的问题是分不开的，那末，我们并不反对不把这两个问题分开来，虽然我们认为这两个问题是可以分开来讨论的。可是我要重复一遍，我们也看不出有什么理由要反对同时讨论这两个问题。但是，总不能说因为这两个问题不能分开，就不必研究这些应该是我们一切工作的对象、是联合国的活动和存在的对象的问题。
    你们说，安全理事会不能胜任，因此必须创造这样一种局面，以便和平一旦受到威胁时联合国不至于束手无策。因此，你们就主张违反宪章，把本来应该属于安全理事会的权力交给联合国大会。
    现在，当我们已同意由联合国大会讨论朝鲜独立问题（这个讨论可能有助于加强和平）的时候，却又有人告诉我们说：“不，只要朝鲜境内的战争仍然继续，我们就不讨论这个问题。”为什么呢？“因为这会妨碍事情的进展。”但是，“妨碍事情的进展”是什么意思呢？妨碍顺利进行战争呢，还是妨碍停战谈判顺利结束呢？你们说：“妨碍了停战谈判顺利进展。”然而，人们简直不可能了解这个问题和朝鲜独立问题到底有什么关系！人们简直不可能明白：帮助停战谈判顺利结束，或者为我们自己订下任务和目标来帮助停战谈判顺利结束，为什么反而可以被说成是可能促使谈判破裂。我们这里有一个什么问题呢？我们这里有一些绝对无法令人相信的事情！看来好像我们大家愈是努力想使战争停止，战争就会愈剧烈似的。另一方面，又好像我们愈不努力使战争停止，战争就会愈快缓和，愈能早日结束似的。瞧，这算是一种什么逻辑呢？这不是逻辑，这是所谓符咒一类的东西。有些人是喜欢用符咒的。但是，我们不是这样的人。有些人是愿意相信符咒的力量的。我们也不是这样的人。尽管有人拚命鼓其如簧之舌，要把这说得好一点，可是符咒总归是符咒！
    有人说：如果我们采取措施，为结束战争而制定这些措施，那末，战争就会更加剧烈；如果我们在这方面少设法帮忙，战争就反而会缩小，会缓和，也许还会停下来而终于更迅速地结束——归根结底说起来，这就是我们的对手在这个问题上的所有推理。这种论调是不值一驳的。
    因此，我们不能同意有人在这里向我们提出的这种逻辑。以后，我们还要谈谈某些代表团，特别是美国代表团之所以这样不愿意讨论这个问题，这样热烈期望延期辩论这个问题，其真正原因是什么，我们认为其真正原因是什么。
    有人告诉我们说：“我们没有把握这样的讨论是不是一定有收获。”但是，如果讨论任何一般性问题的任务还没有得到正确的认识，如果这种讨论不是正确地进行，那又怎能在实际讨论这些问题之前就确定任何一般性的讨论或对任何一般性问题的讨论会有收获呢？
    难道只有那些一般人认为准会产生有益结果的问题才能列入议程吗？如果是那样，那就必须先说明什么是有益的结果。举例说，我们相信十一国代表团提案的提案国会认为昨天的投票和整个辩论已为它们带来了肯定的结果；但是我们认为关于这个问题的辩论和表决，对所谓“集体措施”的整个美国计划说来，是彻底的失败。另一方面，从我们的观点看来，美国这个计划的失败就是“有益的结果”，因为美国和它的大西洋集团的伙伴没有达到它们的目的，而这种目的是和联合国的宗旨相矛盾的，并且是对和平事业的威胁。应该记住，在讨论这个问题时，有不同的态度，不同的意见，因此，在事实没有证明、生活没有证明什么是有益的和什么是无益的以前，就不能决定讨论是否有收获。
    因此，所谓讨论“有收获”或者“无收获”的论调是没有说服力的。拒绝在规定的时间讨论某一国问题的论调是没有说服力的。为了替这个错误的态度辩护而提出的一切理由都是站不住的。问题的症结完全不在这里。问题的症结在于美国和美国的支持者害怕我们一讨论到这个问题，它们对于朝鲜的全部打算就会接触到健全、正直和公正的批评，这样，这种打算就会像霉烂的布匹一样成为碎片。你们就是害怕这一点！不管你们大西洋集团成员国的先生们多么会吹牛，不管你们多么嚣张，我们说，你们是掩盖不了你们的恐惧的，你们害怕人家更多地揭发你们对朝鲜人民发动的海盗战争！你们害怕揭发。可是，你们害怕的还不仅是揭发。你们害怕战争结束，像我们从“华尔街日报”上看到的，许多美国领袖和美国报纸也公开这样说。
    有人说：等待用武力或者用和平方式解决这个问题是必要的。埃尔—古里先生也这样说，真使我感到非常惊讶。
    有人手里拿着武器——不但手里拿着武器，而且采取武装行动，使朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的居民遭受美国飞机残酷野蛮的轰炸，而这还是在停战谈判在板门店进行的时候哩！在这种情况下，还有什么和平方式可言！
    在圣诞节前一天，美国飞机在二十四小时以内出动六百多架次，这当然是在联合国的旗帜和名义下进行的。
    有人说：“等一会，让这个问题在朝鲜谈判中解决吧，我们的干涉只会是有害的！”但是谈判进行得很不好，很不能令人满意。法国代表说：“谈判有困难。”英国代表说：“不，有进展。”美国代表也说：“有进展。”但是我们要说：不仅有困难，而且有不堪设想的困难。因此，他们提到朝鲜谈判，反对联合国出面“干涉”——这是用他们的字眼——时，不过表明他们希望用武力来解决停止敌对行动的问题罢了。那末，谈判的目的何在呢？在这种情况下，这种谈判想达到什么目的呢？显而易见，美方是在利用这种谈判来掩饰他们自己的用武力解决朝鲜战争问题的主张和愿望。但是他们似乎忘记武器不会总是只对一方有用的，武器对双方都是有用的。这个问题和我们这个组织——“和平的工具”——没有关系吗？我们这个组织到底是一种和平的工具，尽管我们在这里听到一些代表团大谈其荒唐透顶的“理论”。有些代表团在这里说，联合国不应当过问这个问题，应当让朝鲜血流成河，应当让城市和村庄继续被焚毁、被破坏，让千千万万的人——妇女、儿童和老年人——继续死亡，应当让青年被送到那里，让他们远离家乡，糊里糊涂死去。联合国会员国应当说这样的话吗？联合国组织应当这样想、这样做吗？不！这是可耻的态度，这是推卸我们的责任的态度。
    所谓“朝鲜统一复兴委员会”只是美国参谋本部附属机构
    有人说，例如秘鲁代表就曾在这里说，远东和平问题应当让那些应该处理这件事情的人去解决。但是，秘鲁代表先生，现在整个困难就在于能够解决远东和平问题的人不是在处理这件事情，而是在从事战争。你说：让他们处理这件事情，他们应当处理这件事情。这就是说，李奇微和美国军方应当处理决定和平问题的事情，而我们联合国不应当讨论和平问题。让李奇微处理这件事情。这样一来，所差的就只是让李奇微将军担任我们大会的主席，让推举他的人做他的僚属或跟班！这正符合于秘鲁代表碧朗第先生概述的计划——这个计划有些人正是求之不得的。但是秘鲁代表显然站错阵营了。他照这样推理，就没有站到和平阵营里，而是站在战争阵营里，站在战争贩子的阵营里——那当然是你自己的事情。有人说：我们不应当设法解决不能解决的问题。但是，难道有“不能解决的问题”吗？在我看来，没有这样的问题。问题总是由人决定的，问题总是取决于人，取决于他们能不能解决这种问题。当然，这也要看环境和情况怎样，但是环境和情况也不是从天上掉下来的，而是人创造的，归根结底，问题是人决定的。但是不讨论、不分析、不去解决这些问题的人是永远不能作出任何明智的决定的。
    秘鲁代表说，我们不应该“扰乱平静，妨碍正在谋求结束战争的板门店谈判的成功”。但这位发言者所说的朝鲜的平静是什么呢？有人告诉我们说，在战争正在朝鲜进行时，我们在安全理事会是没有什么可以讨论的。但这不过是重弹已经被驳斥过的老调而已。智利代表就曾加以驳斥，他说，前年成立的委员会可以讨论许多关于朝鲜的问题，如复兴朝鲜和在朝鲜建立民主制度等等问题。顺便说一句，应当指出，这个委员会——英美集团拒绝在这里讨论它的报告——就被称为“朝鲜统一复兴委员会”。我们为什么不听取它的报告呢？在以前，我们反对组织这个委员会，并且指出它不会有什么结果，不会有什么成就，它只是美国参谋本部的一个部门罢了。如果你们敢在这里讨论这个问题，我们现在也能够证明这些话是真实的。就像你们以前所说的，你们组织这个委员会是因为它可以讨论统一和复兴朝鲜的问题。这和朝鲜独立的问题是有关系的。委员会报告第三百六十九段和三百六十七段清楚说明了这一点。这个委员会做了一点事情——我们至少应该看看它在整整一年中做了些什么事情，这并不是没有意思的。我们愿意看看这个委员会正在做些什么事情。
    但是有人告诉我们说：在战争正在进行时，先不要管这一切。
    这就是和那个向我们提出的美其名为朝鲜独立问题的提案相互关联的各种问题的全部症结所在。有人告诉我们说：不，一定不能管这一切。我们不应该讲出像菲律宾代表在这里竟然讲出的那种话来。如果不是因为菲律宾代表的演说无理取闹，我们就用不着详细谈论他的演说。菲律宾代表在这里以他惯用的诽谤苏联的谰言向我们提出一些非常愚蠢的问题，一些挑拨是非的问题：苏联是否正在参加朝鲜战争？这是“美国之音”挑拨是非的、恣意诽谤的一连串问题之一，菲律宾代表在这里显然始终受“美国之音”的指点。让我们不谈这些挑拨是非的遁词吧。我只要说：菲律宾代表演说中有关我们所讨论的问题的那一部分，只是露骨地证实了美国集团不愿意结束朝鲜战争。
    联合国是维持和平的国际组织应该制止美国阻挠停战谈判
    有人告诉我们，例如乌拉圭代表就告诉我们说：“我们（联合国——乌拉圭代表这样解释）已下令为争取朝鲜的和平而作战，我们无权采取妨碍执行这个命令的任何步骤。”
    乌拉圭代表说：“我们必须不做对司令部有害的任何事情。”
    这样一来，朝鲜战争就变成了为和平而进行的战争了。这无疑是荒谬的话。难道乌拉圭代表不认为不发动战争或在战争一旦爆发后立即设法加以制止会对和平的事业更有利吗？说为了和平而进行战争，这是很矛盾的，是像——譬如说——热和冷、硬和软、白和黑一样。乌拉圭代表显然觉得在舆论面前把这种“哲学”提出来很失礼，感到这种话很蛮横，他就赶快补充说：当然，应该加以适当的解释，应该声明，拒绝在委员会中讨论朝鲜问题并不是表示——像乌拉圭代表所说——“我们并不注意也不关怀战斗人员”，这只是“延期”讨论，“暂时延期”讨论，这完全是因为希望不损害司令部的利益。
    用什么方式不损害司令部——当然是美国司令部——的利益呢？用停战谈判还是用战争呢？
    如果是用和平谈判的方式，那我们就可以向司令部说：“这就是我们的建议。如果你们采取这个建议，你们就可以使和平谈判很快地顺利结束。”但是你们不愿意这样。仅仅这一点就非常明确地说明那些赞成美、英、菲律宾和乌拉圭的代表团的意见的先生们为什么那样极力不主张把朝鲜问题提交我们的委员会的、安全理事会的、以及任何联合国机构讨论。
    当天的议程是朝鲜的独立问题，是朝鲜的复兴问题。我们很愿意看看这个委员会正在干一些什么工作，这个委员会为了要办事而取得金钱，它依靠我们的预算而存在，包括苏联所出的一百多万美元在内。如果这个委员会什么事也不干，如果它毫无用处，如果它的无用竟然达到这种程度，以至于它的报告在这里连听也听不到或者连提都不提，或者它竟干一些有害的事情，那就要提出以下的问题：我们把钱交给这个委员会是为了什么呢，我们为什么需要它呢？正当需要讨论委员会报告的时候，却把那些报告搁置起来，不加以讨论，那又是怎么一回事呢？我的意见和那些一般认为不必谈论这个报告的我的同事们的相反，我要讨论这个报告。关于这
    一点，我认为劳埃德先生的行动很对，他想在委员会的报告里，在他现在拿在手里的小册子里替他自己寻找论据。不过他没有在那里找到有利于他的意见的任何论据。报告内有着和他的意见相反的论据。
    例如在报告的俄文本第四十七页第三百六十九节里，就说到需要用国际的努力给朝鲜以援助。
    也许有人要问：这是正确的呢，还是不正确的呢？我们想这是正确的。但是如果甚至在战争的环境下也需要国际的努力，那末，究竟是谁，是那一个组织才能进行这种国际的努力呢？我回答说：联合国。
    那又是联合国的那个机构呢？是安全理事会和联合国大会，美国代表在这里特别坚决主张是联合国大会。
    因此，需要国际的努力。自然，国际的努力最好而且首先是由联合国来进行，因为联合国是为了维持和平、为了消除战争危险、为了反对已经发生了的侵略和已经爆发了的战争、为了建立国际安全而设立的唯一国际组织。安全理事会和大会是代表联合国的（你们自己在你们的“保障和平的联合行动”案中承认了这一点）。
    但是现在，当我们谈到这件事情时，你们对我们说：“不要提到这件事，不要管这一切事情。”为什么呢？我已经说过，并且还要再说一遍，原因是：如果我们提到委员会的报告，分析委员会的活动和差不多两年以来朝鲜发生的一切事情，那末，你们的一切“看法”和建议——所有这一切，都要像腐烂的布一样解体了。
    因此，有人在这里提出了我们不应过问朝鲜局势的荒谬论调。他们不从事“国际努力”，不通过国际组织采取行动；相反的，他们却想说服我们，最好是使国际组织不采取行动，最好是不要阻止。
    不要阻止谁呢？李奇微。不要阻止什么呢？我们得到的回答是：“不要阻止他进行争取和平的战争。”但是，这简直荒谬！我们要求说明，如果这不荒谬，究竟又是什么意思。但是我们没有得到任何答复，直到关于这个问题的讨论结束时，我们还没有得到答复。这是不可容忍的。联合国必须发表它的意见，它绝不应“不阻止李奇微将军”，而必须向他指出，他一定不要提出荒谬的要求来阻挠停战谈判。我们要提到李奇微关于交换战俘的要求，作为这种荒谬要求的一个例子。
    大家知道，美军司令部有朝鲜战俘十七万以上，另一方有美英战俘一万一千五百人。
    李奇微将军建议按照一对一的原则进行交换，那就是说：美军司令部同意遣返一万一千五百名朝鲜战俘，把十六万人留作抵押品，而朝鲜人民军司令部和中国人民志愿军司令部则要遣返所有的战俘。
    这是什么呢？这种“原则”不是根本违反了所有国际公约，所有与此有关的国际法最基本的准则吗？这根本违反了全部国际惯例。国际法规定：战争结束后交换战俘，不得按照一对一的原则，而要按照全体对全体的原则进行交换，无论双方手中的俘虏人数是否相等。
    要不然，我们就会看到一种史无前例的情况：战争是结束了，但是签订了和平停战协定的某一国家的公民仍然被他方当作俘虏扣留着。所以，我们就这一点发表我们的权威意见是十分自然而且十分适当的。但是有些代表们想证明联合国应该站在一边，应该等待着，直到（就像他们在这里所说的）战争问题在战场上获得解决的时候为止。
    苏联加强反对战争贩子的宣传不让联合国变成美国侵略工具
    我们怎样能了解这种主张呢？我们只能作如下的了解：这种主张意味着这些代表们同意在干涉行动胜利结束以后，在美国将领们认为没有什么东西会妨碍他们获得他们军事胜利的果实以后，再讨论朝鲜问题。可是，如果干涉者所搞的事进行得不妙，像谈判开始以前那样，那些采取这种主张的代表们就不会拒绝在联合国内讨论朝鲜问题了。那时他们必然会记起大会，不但绝对不会拒绝，而且还会要求大会干预这个问题。
    那时，从美英集团代表们的那些座位上又会发出
    一种叫嚣。他们会要求讨论这个问题，要求谴责
    “侵略者”，“惩罚侵略者”，并且要求采取紧急的“集体措施”来保障真正的侵略者的“安全”。那时我们就会听到“和平”这个字眼。但同时，这些先生又会要求第一委员会不要阻碍战争，他们会这样说：“让事情自然发展下去，让这些问题由战争、武装力量或者和平来解决。”这里所谈到的和平仅仅是一种烟幕，同时他们的这种和平又是相当古怪的——有点像一个杀人放火的土匪，拳打脚踢、挥刀弄棍……。
    这是我们不能同意的。这种观念是完全不能接受的：它和一切使我们得以坐在联合国的会议桌旁边进行讨论的观念根本矛盾，只要这个组织还没有最后变成战争的工具。不幸的是：它已经开始并且在继续沿着这条道路前进了。我们正竭尽全力使它不要再沿这条道路前进，不要进一步堕入这种深渊。但是在这个问题上，正像在其他问题上一样，我们不幸经常是居于少数。我们加强联合国使之成为和平的工具的努力竟被人称为一种宣传。不，这不是宣传，这是反宣传，反对战争贩子宣传的宣传。
    让我再度引证委员会的报告。顺便提一下，这个报告里面有这么四节——第六十八节到七十一节——这四节都列在特别标明为委员会活动范围的那一章下面。这几节的意思是什么呢？从第七十一节里可以明显地看出，这几节的意思不外乎下面所说的一些。第七十一节的意思照字面读下来就是这样：联合国在朝鲜的主要努力暂时是军事性的，委员会的主要任务是尽一切力量支持旨在保障大韩民国独立的联合国武装部队的军事行动。鉴于情况变更，委员会因此决定现在它的职责也应有所改变。我们来讨论讨论这个问题是很重要的。这个联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会是怎么样由于事态的发展而变成了一个“尽一切可能的力量以支持联合国武装部队的军事行动”的委员会了呢？弄清楚这一点是很重要的。
    事情原来是这样：这个委员会认为它的职责是援助所谓联合国武装部队，就是美国的武装部队。但是另外还有一个耐人寻味的问题，就是，这个委员会曾以什么样的方式以及什么样的行动来援助过这种军事行动？它将来是否还要进行援助呢？据报告进一步说：委员会就是以那种能够保证使朝鲜达到独立的目的的方式进行了援助。报告公开说的是：保证大韩民国的独立。
    这一点是最重要的：委员会已经沦落到了这种地步，一个为朝鲜的统一和复兴这个明确的目的而产生的委员会，已经不得不变成华盛顿参谋本部和李奇微将军的战地司令部的附属机构了，并且不得不把援助美、英、加、澳等国的武装部队的军事行动当作它的主要工作了。
    所谓联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会已经变成了李奇微总部下面的一个部门。它的主要目的，像报告所说的那样，是努力顺利地完成战争提出的任务。照报告所描绘的那样，就好像是说：委员会工作的目的是以援助美国将军指挥下的武装部队来促进朝鲜复兴。然而这些武装部队正在作些什么事情来达到复兴朝鲜的这种目的呢？他们正在毁灭城镇、乡村，并且杀害居民。
    所以，我们认为：那些反对在此地审查委员会报告的人们是因为他们害怕被人家揭露真相，害怕第
    一委员会公开讨论这些问题会打乱他们的一切算盘并弄乱他们的一手纸牌。他们害怕把这个所谓朝鲜统一复兴委员会——这个已经变成李奇微将军战地办事处的委员会——的可耻的活动所产生的可耻的结果暴露出来。这就是美英集团的代表团在他们看到他们在朝鲜的罪恶侵略计划和行动有彻底暴露的危险的时候，就突然——我应该说慌忙——退却的真正理由。他们在我们一谈到朝鲜独立这个问题时就马上宣告退却，这是因为他们自己也知道，他们关于朝鲜“独立”的一切虚伪的空话，所有掩饰他们把朝鲜变为美国殖民地的空话，是一定会被人揭穿的。（新华社据塔斯社巴黎十二日电）
