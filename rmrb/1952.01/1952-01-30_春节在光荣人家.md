    Spring Festival at the Home of a Honored Family
    Before the Spring Festival, the reporter visited the family of Liu Xiancheng, political instructor of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in Gengjia Village, Boxing County, Shandong Province.

    This honored family has a total of eight people. Liu Xiancheng is the political instructor of a certain battalion of the Volunteer Army; his mother, Chen Wenju, is a county-level labor model for revolutionary army families and also a member of the county and district democratic women's federations; his father, Liu Xisan, is an old worker in a railway factory with 29 years of service; his eldest brother joined the People's Liberation Army in 1945; his eldest sister is a member of the township democratic women's federation and the secretary of the Gengjia Village branch of the Chinese Communist Party. The other two sisters are also staff members of the People's Government. The youngest brother, who is still studying, often says to his mother, "When I grow up, I want to serve the country like my brother."

    This honored family is happily preparing for the Spring Festival. The villagers had already been planning how to help them celebrate the festival. January 19th, according to the old custom, was the day of the Little New Year. On this day, many people were busy building pine gates, hanging honorary plaques, and posting Spring Festival couplets for Grandma Chen Wenju's family. A group of children, beating drums and performing the Yangko dance, invited Grandma Chen Wenju to participate in the village's symposium to comfort the families of martyrs and soldiers.

    In 1951, Grandma Chen Wenju's family had a particularly good harvest because the substitute farmers took care of her land even more attentively than their own. Her 24 mu of land yielded a total of 3,000 jin of cotton and 1,500 jin of grain throughout the year. Ma Fuwen, who cultivated three mu of cotton for Chen Wenju, tended it three times and hoed it seven times last year, yielding more than 250 jin of cotton per mu, setting the highest cotton yield record in the village. Grandma Chen Wenju, 54, is an expert who can master a whole set of farming techniques. She cultivated nine mu of land herself. Everyone in the village praised her: "When she starts working, some men can't even keep up with her!" The mutual aid group she organized in 1947 is now the most solid in the village. Grandpa Liu Xisan, 63, also often goes to the fields to do some light work.

    This year, this honored family is celebrating the Spring Festival in accordance with Chairman Mao's call to "increase production and practice thrift." The whole family did not buy a single stick of incense or a single sheet of spirit money. Before the Spring Festival, Chen Wenju reviewed last year's production and formulated a plan for increasing production and practicing economy in 1952. The plan states that it is necessary to unite the military dependents and women of the whole village to participate in agricultural production and help them learn production techniques. Her own production volume is also required to increase by 10% to 20% compared to last year.

    On the evening of the 19th, the honored mother was busy making new cotton clothes for the Spring Festival when Comrade Liu Xiancheng sent a letter from the Korean front, wishing his father and mother good health. The letter also included the following congratulatory poem: "For the needs of the motherland, for the safety of our hometown, our brothers and sisters have stepped forward and embarked on the forefront of the motherland's struggle." How happy the two old people were to read their son's letter! They immediately wrote a reply, encouraging their son to be vigilant against the U.S. imperialists' sabotage of the Korean armistice negotiations and to prepare to give the enemy a heavier blow. The letter said: "The Spring Festival is coming soon, and we hope that you will make even greater contributions to the motherland during the Spring Festival."

### 春节在光荣人家

    春节在光荣人家
    新华社记者　陈雨明
    春节前，记者访问了山东省博兴县耿家村中国人民志愿军某部政治教导员刘先成的家庭。
    这个光荣人家共有八口人。刘先成是志愿军某营的政治教导员；母亲陈文举是全县的革命军人家属劳动模范，也是县、区民主妇女联合会的委员；父亲刘锡三是有二十九年工龄的铁路工厂老工人；大哥在一九四五年参加了人民解放军；大姐是乡民主妇女联合会委员和中国共产党耿家村支部书记。另外两个姐妹也都是人民政府的工作人员。正在读书的小弟弟也常对他母亲说：“我长大了，也要像哥哥一样的为祖国服务。”
    这家光荣人家，正在愉快地筹备过春节。而乡亲们更早就在盘算着怎样帮助他们过春节了。一月十九日，按照旧习惯，是过小年的日子。这天，许多人忙着给陈文举大娘家扎松门，挂光荣牌，贴春联。一群孩子敲着锣鼓、扭着秧歌请陈文举大娘去参加村里的慰问烈属、军属座谈会。
    一九五一年，陈文举大娘家的收成特别好。因为代耕户把她的地比自己的地种得还当心。她家的二十四亩地全年共收了三千斤棉花和一千五百斤粮食。马富文给陈文举代耕的三亩棉花，去年都修了三遍、锄了七遍，每亩收棉二百五十多斤，创全村棉花产量的最高纪录。五十四岁的陈文举大娘，是能够掌握一整套耕作技术的能手。她自己种了九亩地。全村的人都称赞她：“干起活来，有些男人还比不上呢！”她在一九四七年组织起来的互助组，现在是全村最巩固的一个。六十三岁的刘锡三大爷也经常下地做些轻活。
    今年这个光荣人家的春节，是照着毛主席“增加生产、厉行节约”的号召过的。全家没有买一枝香和一张烧纸。春节前，陈文举检查了去年的生产，订出了一九五二年的增产节约计划。计划里写着：要团结全村的军属妇女参加农业生产，并且帮助她们学习生产技术。自己的生产量也要求比去年提高一成到两成。
    十九日晚上，光荣的妈妈正在赶制过春节穿的新棉衣，刘先成同志从朝鲜前线寄来了家书，祝贺他的父亲母亲健康。信上并写了这样的一首贺词：“为了祖国的需要，为了家乡的安全，我们兄妹挺身而出，走上祖国斗争的最前线。”两个老人看了儿子的家书是多么的高兴啊！他们立刻写了一封回信，鼓励儿子警惕美帝国主义破坏朝鲜停战谈判，准备给敌人更沉重的打击。信上说：“春节就到了，希望你在春节的时候，为祖国立下更大的功劳。”
