    Zhang Xishun's New Year's Thoughts
    Believes Organization is an Important Factor in Increasing Yield Per Unit Area
    In this New Year of 1952, I want to share my thoughts.
    I believe that organized production is an important factor in increasing yield per unit area. Take myself as an example. I live in Niangniangmiao Village, Daming, Hebei, where the soil is very poor, mostly sandy. In the past, my millet yield was only around 120 jin per mu. In 1945, I responded to Chairman Mao's call to "get organized" and formed a mutual aid group with five households in the village. Since then, the yield has increased year by year. By 1951, my group's high-yield fields produced more than 1,300 jin of millet per mu, ordinary paddy fields produced 800 jin of millet per mu, and dry land produced 400 jin of millet per mu. The rapid increase in our group's yield is primarily due to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Before liberation, among the 620 households in my village, more than 480 had little or no land, and most of the good land in the village was controlled by 30 landlords. The peasants were severely exploited and oppressed, and production could not develop and improve. After liberation, the peasants were liberated, land was distributed, and the People's Government provided assistance in various ways, lending seeds to those who had none and fertilizers to those who needed them. Naturally, production was able to increase. But this was not enough. If we did not organize, production would still increase very slowly. For example, the 70 individual households in my village in 1951 still only produced an average of just over 140 jin of millet per mu, which is very different from the production of our organized households. This shows the superiority of being organized. Only by being organized can we have the conditions to improve farming methods, improve farming techniques, and use new-style agricultural tools, which can quickly increase yield per unit area.
    As our mutual aid group's yield increased, the group itself also grew stronger. Now my group has grown to 32 households, and every family has enough food and clothing and is living a good life. In order to further develop agricultural production, all members of my group are now discussing the organization of an agricultural producers' cooperative. At present, we are resolutely responding to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production and practice economy" and plan to create fifteen mu of high-yield fields that produce 1,530 jin of millet per mu next year, ordinary paddy fields to produce 1,000 jin per mu, and dry land to produce 480 jin per mu; in addition, we plan to produce 850 jin of corn per mu and 680 jin of seed cotton per mu. All members of the group have expressed their determination to complete this production increase plan.

    张希顺新年发表感想
    认为组织起来是提高单位面积产量的重要因素
    在这一九五二年的新年，我要谈谈我的感想。
    我觉得，组织起来生产，是提高单位面积产量的重要因素。就拿我自己来说吧，我住的河北大名娘娘庙村，地质很坏，大部是沙土。我过去种的谷子每亩产量只有一百二十斤上下。一九四五年我响应毛主席“组织起来”的号召，组织村中五户成立了互助组，以后产量就逐年提高。到一九五一年，我组的丰产田每亩产到一千三百多斤谷子，普通的水田每亩产八百斤谷子，旱田每亩产四百斤。我组产量能够这样快的提高，首先要归功于毛主席、共产党。解放前我村六百二十户人家中，四百八十多户没地或少地，村中大部好地掌握在三十家地主手里，农民被剥削压榨得很厉害，生产当然不能发展和提高。解放后，农民翻身，分了土地，人民政府又从各方面进行扶助，没种子借种子，没肥料贷肥料，生产当然就能够提高。但这还不够，我们如果不组织起来，生产提高还是很慢的。例如我村现有的七十户单干户，一九五一年平均每亩谷子还只产一百四十多斤，和我们组织起来的户的生产量相差很远，这就说明组织起来的优越性了。只有组织起来，我们才有条件去改进耕作方法、提高耕作技术，使用新式农具，这样就可能很快提高单位面积产量。
    我们互助组的产量提高了，组本身也壮大了。现在我组已发展到三十二户，家家丰衣足食，过着美好的日子。我组全体组员为进一步发展农业生产，现在正在讨论组织农业生产合作社。目前我们坚决响应毛主席“增产节约”的号召，计划明年要创造十五亩每亩产谷子（粟）一千五百三十斤的丰产田，普通水田每亩要产一千斤，旱田每亩产四百八十斤；另外，计划玉米每亩产八百五十斤，棉花每亩产籽棉六百八十斤。全体组员表示一定要完成这个增产计划。    农业劳动模范  张希顺
