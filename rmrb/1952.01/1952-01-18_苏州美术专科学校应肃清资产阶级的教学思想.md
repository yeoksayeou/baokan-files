    Suzhou Art College Should Eliminate Bourgeois Teaching Ideology

    Comrade Editor: The bureaucratic work style of the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office of Culture and Education in leading the work of Suzhou Art College has reached an intolerable level. The private Suzhou Art College was originally one of the best-equipped art schools in the country. After liberation, it was subsidized by the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office of Culture and Education, becoming privately run with public assistance. This was necessary. But if the state only subsidizes the school economically and does not provide political leadership, then objectively it is condoning incorrect ideas to poison our youth. Suzhou Art College was notorious for its "conservatism" before liberation. Students who engaged in wood carving, for example, would be expelled. After liberation, the teachers at this school have not been reformed. Apart from participating in the regional summer education research conference, the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office of Culture and Education has never seriously organized teachers to study, especially regarding Chairman Mao's literary and art line. The school authorities are perfunctory to superiors and suppress criticism internally, and administrative and teaching work is a mess. One teacher told the students: "Work hard to learn technology. If you learn technology well, you will have food everywhere!" "You are fourth and fifth-year students with a high level, so you should paint oil paintings, not comic strips." In fact, he also organized students to draw comic strips, which was to sell to Shanghai publishers. As a result, some students now refuse to draw comic strips if they are not paid for them. In addition to teaching at the art college, this teacher also teaches at three or four other schools and still draws advertisements late at night. He is late for class, but says: "Teachers at the Paris Art College only visit the school once or twice every two weeks!" He is very dissatisfied with his salary, saying, "Give less, teach less, even if you give 300,000, I won't teach!" He dozes off while studying, but says: "What are you forcing? Chairman Mao said that learning depends on self-awareness and willingness!" With such a bad ideological style, he was also invited to teach at the Southern Jiangsu College of Culture and Education. Another music teacher flirts with female students in class and also takes in music "apprentices" at home, forbidding the apprentices from participating in parades and political activities. Under the education of such teachers, some students say: "I don't study politics. I came to the art college, not the revolutionary university!" And: "After five years of art college, I can go to revolutionary university for a few more years!" When the Suzhou Federation of Literary and Art Circles launched the New Year picture creation campaign, some students refused to draw, saying: "If we create, we will paint oil paintings. I won't paint New Year pictures!" And: "Serving politics is not art." Of course, most of the students are eager to make progress, and many students and teachers have also fought against backward phenomena. However, because the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office did not support them, progressive students were "struggled against"; progressive teachers were driven away. Although the Culture and Education Office sent people to investigate, the investigators held a one-hour meeting with the fourth-year students (about twenty people) in the morning, and then closed the door to talk with the school leaders for most of the day. Some students and teachers wanted to find them to report the situation, but it was said that the investigation had been completed and they had already left. Now, outside the school, there is a booming ideological reform movement, and a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, but inside the school, it is desolate, like another world, allowing the reactionary artistic ideas of the bourgeoisie to run rampant. Is this tolerable? We believe that the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office of Culture and Education should conduct a thorough inspection and seriously lead the school to carry out reforms.

    Editor's Note: The Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office of Culture and Education should, in conjunction with the ideological reform movement, seriously and responsibly rectify the work of Suzhou Art College and earnestly criticize and eliminate bourgeois art education ideas. The East China Ministry of Culture should also assist in this work.

### 苏州美术专科学校应肃清资产阶级的教学思想

    苏州美术专科学校应肃清资产阶级的教学思想
    编辑同志：苏南行署文教处领导苏州美术专科学校工作方面的官僚主义作风，已达到不能容忍的程度。私立苏州美术专科学校原是国内有数的设备完善的美术学校。解放后，由苏南行署文教处津贴，私立公助。这是必要的。但假如国家对这个学校只是在经济上津贴，而不在政治上加以领导，那末客观上就是纵容不正确的思想来毒害我们青年。苏州美术专科学校在解放前的“保守”是很出名的，同学如刻木刻，就会被开除出去。解放后，这个学校的教师们还没有得到改造。教师们除了参加过全区性的暑期教育研究会外，苏南行署文教处从来没有认真组织过教师学习，尤其是关于毛主席文艺路线的学习。学校当局对上敷衍塞责，对内压制批评，行政教学工作是一片混乱。有一位教师向同学们讲：“你们努力学技术吧，学好技术到处有饭吃！”“你们是四五年级学生，程度高，应该画油画，不要画连环画。”实际上他也组织同学画连环画，那是为了卖给上海出版商。因此现在一部分同学听说画连环画不给稿费就不画。这位教师除了本人在美术专科学校教书外，在外面还兼了三四个学校的课，深夜还兼画广告。他在上课时迟到，却说：“巴黎美术专科学校的教师一两个礼拜不过到学校看一两次！”他对自己的薪水大为不满，他说：“少给少教，就是给三十万也教！”学习时他打瞌睡，却说：“你们强迫什么，毛主席说学习是靠自觉自愿的！”他有这样恶劣的思想作风，还被请到苏南文教学院兼课。另一位音乐教师，上课时向女同学调笑，家中还收音乐“学徒”，不准学徒参加游行和政治活动。在这样一些教师的教育下，有些同学说：“我不学习政治，我是进美术专科学校，并不是进革命大学！”又说：“五年读完美术专科学校，出去再读几年革命大学就行啦！”苏州文联发动了年画创作，有些同学就不肯画，说：“我们创作就画油画，年画我不画！”又说：“为政治服务不是艺术。”当然，同学中大多数都是要求进步的，很多同学和教师也曾向落后现象斗争过。但是，因为苏南行署没有支持，进步的同学反被“斗争”了；进步的教师给气走了。文教处虽派人来调查过，但来调查的人上午和四年级同学（二十几个人）开了一个钟头的会，接着就和学校里的负责人关起门来谈了大半天。一些同学和教师想找他们反映情况，但是据说调查已经完毕，早就走了。现在学校外边是热火朝天的思想改造运动、反贪污浪费反官僚主义的运动，学校里面却是一片冷落，像是另一个世界，让资产阶级的反动的艺术思想在泛滥着。难道这是可以容忍的吗？我们认为，苏南行署文教处应作深入的检查，严肃地领导这个学校进行改革。　金良　赤军
    编者按：苏南行署文教处应结合思想改造运动，严肃负责地整顿苏州美术专科学校的工作，认真批判和清除资产阶级的艺术教育思想。华东文化部也应帮助进行这项工作。
