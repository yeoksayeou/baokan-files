    Tianjin Steel Fittings Factory
    Inspecting the Causes of Waste and Bureaucracy, Workers Express Determination to Work Hard in Production
    Comrade Editor: Since the People's Daily successively published articles criticizing the waste occurring at the Tianjin Steel Fittings Factory and the bureaucratic style of personnel director Wang Chengjun, the higher-level authorities have dispatched a work team to our factory to inspect work. Under the leadership of the Party and the administration, all factory employees have engaged in a series of political studies. Now, everyone has realized that to do a good job in the increase production and practice economy campaign, we must first oppose bureaucracy, because bureaucracy is a hotbed of corruption and waste. The workers have been reflecting: Today we workers are masters of our own house, with Chairman Mao and the Communist Party backing us, we are not afraid of the suppression of Wang Chengjun and others. In the future, we should put in more effort, do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy, and use concrete achievements to support the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    天津钢铁配件厂
    检查浪费和官僚主义原因职工纷纷表示要努力生产
    编辑同志：自人民日报先后刊载了批评天津钢铁配件厂发生浪费现象和人事主任王承君的官僚主义作风的稿件后，上级机关已派工作组来我厂检查工作。全厂职工在党和行政的领导下，进行了一系列的政治学习。现在，大家已认识到要搞好增产节约运动，首先必须反对官僚主义；因为官僚主义是贪污浪费的温床。职工们纷纷反映：今天我们工人当了家，有毛主席和共产党给我们撑腰，不怕王承君等的压制了；今后我们应该多加一把劲，搞好增产节约，用具体成绩来支持中国人民志愿军。
