    Beijing Municipal Thrift Examination Committee's Industrial and Commercial Circles Branch Holds Emergency Meeting
    Warning Those Who Embezzle and Offer Bribes to Confess Immediately and Thoroughly
    Those Who Hope to Get Away With It Will Suffer the Same Fate as the Treacherous Merchant Liu Yuanjing
    [From Our Newspaper] Following the arrest of illegal businessmen Liu Yuanjing and four others in Beijing, the Industrial and Commercial Circles Branch of the Beijing Municipal Thrift Examination Committee held an emergency meeting on the morning of the 13th, warning industrialists and businessmen who have engaged in embezzlement and bribery to take the fate of illegal businessmen Liu Yuanjing and others as a lesson, and to quickly and thoroughly confess and report during the inspection period. More than 200 people attended, including heads of various industries and directors of the district offices of the Federation of Industry and Commerce.
    Fu Huating, Director of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, pointed out at the meeting: Liu Yuanjing and others downplayed their crimes, colluded with each other, and refused to confess thoroughly. They thought their "defenses" were well-built and that they could侥幸混过去 (hope to muddle through); but they did not know that the government had already grasped the evidence. Their fate is well-deserved. All dishonest embezzlers and bribe-givers must recognize the policy and confess thoroughly, otherwise they will follow the path of Liu Yuanjing. Fu Huating said: The government has been extremely benevolent and righteous to our industrial and commercial circles. The inspection date has been repeatedly postponed to give embezzlers and bribe-givers an opportunity to confess and repent, but some embezzlers and bribe-givers still do not confess their problems, or downplay their crimes, or do not confess thoroughly. This is completely wrong. Only by honestly confessing can one receive leniency from the people. Confessions can continue after the inspection begins. We must seize this last opportunity. Confessing now can lead to a lighter punishment than not confessing. Fu Huating called on the heads of various industries to immediately convey this message to their members, urging everyone to quickly confess. At the same time, they should vigorously assist and patiently persuade key households in their respective industries who may have problems, and mobilize them to confess thoroughly.
    Group discussions were held after the meeting. During the small group discussions, those present unanimously agreed that the illegal businessmen Liu Yuanjing and others' theft of state property and refusal to confess, attempting to defy the law, was a case of 刘犯等自食其果 (Liu and the other criminals reaping what they sowed) and a well-deserved punishment. At the same time, they further realized that downplaying crimes and hoping to侥幸 (get away with it) cannot be concealed or muddled through. Some people confessed to bribery and tax evasion on the spot; some asked to go back and write materials; and others, who had previously only confessed to bribery, expressed their determination to thoroughly confess their acts of cutting corners and stealing state property.
    That afternoon, most industries held separate emergency meetings to convey the content of the morning's meeting, further mobilizing industrialists and businessmen to confess and report facts of embezzlement and bribery. (Wang Jing)

    北京市节约检查委员会工商界分会召开紧急会议
    警告贪污行贿者立即彻底坦白
    希图侥幸的人就会得到奸商刘元敬同样的下场
    【本报讯】北京市不法商人刘元敬等五人被逮捕后，北京市节约检查委员会工商界分会，十三日上午召开了紧急会议，警告有贪污行贿行为的工商业者，以不法商人刘元敬等的下场为前车之鉴，在检查期间，赶快彻底坦白、检举。到会的有各行业负责人、工商业联合会各区办事处主任等二百多人。
    工商联主任委员傅华亭在会上指出：刘元敬等避重就轻、串通勾结、拒不坦白，他们以为“防御工事”做得好，可以侥幸混过去；可是他们不知道政府早就掌握了材料。他们的下场，正是罪有应得。一切不老实的贪污行贿分子，要认清政策，彻底坦白，否则就是走刘元敬的道路。傅华亭说：政府对我们工商界，可以说是仁至义尽了。一再延迟检查日期，给贪污行贿分子以坦白悔改的机会，可是还有些贪污行贿分子，不交代问题，或避重就轻，交代得不彻底，这是完全错误的。只有老老实实坦白，才能得到人民的宽大。检查开始以后，还可以继续坦白，我们要抓住这个最后的机会。现在坦白，还可以比不坦白减轻处分。傅华亭号召各行业负责人，要即刻向会员传达，叫大家赶快坦白，同时对本行业可能有问题的重点户，要大力帮助，耐心说服，动员他们彻底坦白。
    会后分组进行讨论。在小组讨论会上，到会的人对不法商人刘元敬等盗窃国家财产，拒不坦白以身试法，一致认为：这是刘犯等自食其果，罪有应得；同时更进一步认识到避重就轻、希图侥幸是瞒不了、混不过去的。当场就有人交代了行贿、漏税事实；有的人要求回去写材料；还有人从前光交代了行贿问题，这次表示对于自己偷工减料、盗窃国家财产的行为也一定彻底坦白。
    当天下午，大多数行业都分别召开了紧急会议，传达上午大会的内容，进一步动员工商业者坦白和检举贪污行贿的事实。（王敬）
