    Bureaucratic Practices of Leading Cadres in Xuzhou Transport Company Lead to Building Collapse and Worker Injuries

    Editor: On December 5, 1951, when more than 130 workers from the Eighth Brigade of the Second Office of the Xuzhou Transport Company were holding a meeting on the upper floor of the brigade headquarters, the floor beams broke due to excessive load, causing the floor to collapse and injuring 49 workers. This building was constructed before liberation, and the engineering and materials were not good. Although it appeared usable on the surface, it was actually decayed inside. The Eighth Brigade and the Second Office knew about the dangerous condition of the building, and the company's leading cadres also knew about it. However, the company's leading cadres did not study such important issues and did not consider the situation reported by their subordinates. Last summer, the Labor Bureau notified all factories, mines, and enterprises to properly repair their buildings to prevent danger, but the leading cadres of the Transport Company did not implement this. The company's leading cadres usually lack safety education for workers, and the inspection system is also inadequate. This bureaucratic work style is the main reason for this tragic accident.

    徐州搬运公司领导干部官僚主义
    造成楼房下塌压伤工人事故
    编辑同志：一九五一年十二月五日，徐州搬运公司第二办事处第八大队一百三十多人在大队部楼上开会时，因楼板负荷过重，致楼梁折断，楼板塌陷，压伤工人四十九人。这座楼房为解放前建筑，工程和材料都不好，表面看来还可使用，而实际上里边已经腐朽了。楼房的危险情况，第八大队和第二办事处是知道的，公司的领导干部也是知道的。但是，公司的领导干部却不研究这样重大的问题，对下边反映上来的情况也不加考虑。去年夏季，劳动局曾通知各厂、矿、企业妥善修缮房屋以防止危险，但搬运公司领导干部没有执行。公司领导干部平时对工人缺乏安全教育，检查制度也不健全。这种官僚主义作风，就是发生此次惨痛事故的主要原因。  欧阳儒泉
