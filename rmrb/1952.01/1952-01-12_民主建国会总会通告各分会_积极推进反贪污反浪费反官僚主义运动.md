    Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: The Headquarters of the China Democratic National Construction Association issued a circular to all branches on the 9th, urging them to actively promote the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

    The circular stated: The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is a movement of great economic and political significance, and all members must fully recognize its importance and actively participate. In this movement, all members and industrialists and businessmen must especially focus on opposing bribery, tax evasion, and defrauding state property.

    The circular requested that all branches immediately convene meetings of all committee members to discuss in detail the steps for promoting the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and organize special committees to carry out the work. All members should study "Mao Zedong on Combating Corruption and Waste," the People's Daily editorial of January 4th, "In the Great Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy, What is the Key to Mobilizing the Masses?" the report by Bo Yibo "Strive for a Deep and Universal Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement," and the reports made by the heads of local people's governments on this movement. Each branch should first conduct an internal examination, and then, through the Federation of Industry and Commerce, call on all industrialists and businessmen to voluntarily confess and mutually report on each other. During the internal examination, the person in charge of the branch must first conduct a self-criticism and at the same time call on members to voluntarily confess. The person in charge of the branch should explain to the members: Those who are guilty of corruption, bribery, tax evasion, or fraud, as long as they voluntarily confess, those with serious crimes can have their punishment reduced, and those with minor crimes can be exempted from punishment; those who have been extorted can report the extortionist, and except for extortion incidents before liberation, as long as it is true, they will not only be innocent but can also recover the赃物 (ill-gotten gains/stolen goods). Voluntary confession must be combined with mutual reporting. Those who report bribery or provide clues can be rewarded. Members who are guilty of corruption, bribery, tax evasion, or fraud with minor offenses should be educated and reformed, and those with serious offenses should be expelled from membership. Each branch must mobilize active members to go to various industries and regions as the backbone to carry out the work of patient and enlightening mobilization among industrialists and businessmen.

    The circular stated: In the past two years, industrialists and businessmen have experienced the unification of national finance and economics and the reorganization of industry and commerce, and have participated in the three major movements of resisting America, aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Their political consciousness has been raised, but the nature of seeking profit, harming others to benefit oneself, and speculation has not been fundamentally changed in thought and action. Therefore, in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, industrialists and businessmen should thoroughly transform their thinking.

    The circular finally requested that each branch must summarize its experience and report to the headquarters at the end of each stage of the movement.

    民主建国会总会通告各分会
    积极推进反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动
    【新华社十日讯】民主建国会总会在九日通告各分会，积极推进反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。
    通告说：反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动是一个具有重大经济和政治意义的运动，全体会员必须充分重视，积极参加。在运动中，全体会员和工商业者必须特别着重反对行贿、反对逃税、反对诈欺国家财物。
    通告要求各分会立即召集全体委员会议，详细讨论推进反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的步骤，并组织专门委员会进行工作。全体会员应学习“毛泽东同志论反对贪污浪费”、人民日报一月四日社论“在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争中，发动群众的关键何在？”、薄一波所作“为深入地普遍地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动而斗争”的报告和当地人民政府首长有关这一运动所作的报告等。各分会应先进行会内检查，然后通过工商联合会号召全体工商业者自动坦白和相互检举。在会内检查时，分会负责人必须首先进行自我检讨，同时号召会员自动坦白。分会负责人应向会员说明：贪污、行贿、逃税、诈欺的分子，只要自动坦白，罪重者可以减轻处分，罪轻者可以免受处分；被勒索者可以检举勒索人，除解放前的被勒索事件外，只要确实，不但无罪，还可追回赃物。自动坦白必须结合相互检举。对于检举行贿或指出线索者，可给予褒奖。会员贪污、行贿、逃税、诈欺罪恶轻者，加以教育改造，重者应开除会籍。各分会必须动员会员中的积极分子到各行业、各地区去，作为在工商业者中间开展运动的骨干，向工商业者进行耐心启发的动员工作。
    通告说：两年多来，工商业者经历了国家财经统一和工商业的改组，参加了抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命三大运动，政治觉悟已有提高，但尚未从思想上和行动上根本改变唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧的本质。因此，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，工商业者就应彻底改造自己的思想。
    通告最后要求各分会在运动每告一段落时，必须总结经验，报告总会。
