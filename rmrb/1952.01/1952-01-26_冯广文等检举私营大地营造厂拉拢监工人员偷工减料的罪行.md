    Feng Guangwen and Others Expose the Crimes of the Private Dadi Construction Factory in Bribing Supervisory Personnel to Cut Corners
    Editor: Last May, the military band of the Political Department of the North China Military Region built more than 50 rooms at Guangtong Temple outside Xizhimen. This project was contracted by the private Dadi Construction Factory in Beijing. At that time, both parties signed a contract stipulating that the houses would be guaranteed for three years, and the contractor would be responsible for repairs. During construction, the Dadi Construction Factory cut corners, and almost all the bricks used were waste bricks. The manager of the Dadi Construction Factory wooed the supervisor, Gao Lianyuan, treating Gao Lianyuan to wine, meals, theater, and baths. He said to Gao Lianyuan that he had lost money on this project and wanted Gao Lianyuan to take care of him. Gao Lianyuan's position was not firm, and he did not strictly inspect the corner-cutting. Less than a month after the completion of the project, more than a dozen houses started to leak. The military band handled it according to the contract and asked the Dadi Construction Factory to repair it, but they ignored it. We suggest that relevant departments investigate and deal with the bribery of cadres and corner-cutting by the Dadi Construction Factory.

    冯广文等检举私营大地营造厂拉拢监工人员偷工减料的罪行
    编辑同志：去年五月，华北军区政治部军乐队在西直门外广通寺盖了五十多间房子。这项工程，是北京市私营大地营造厂承包的，当时双方签订了合同，规定房子保用三年，由承包者负责修理。在施工时，大地营造厂偷工减料，用的砖几乎全部是废砖。大地营造厂的经理拉拢监工人员高连元，请高连元吃酒，吃饭，看戏，洗澡。他对高连元说，这次工程他赔了钱，要高连元照顾一下。高连元立场不坚定，对偷工减料的事不严格检查。工程完工后不到一个月，十多间房子就漏起雨来。军乐队按合同办理，要大地营造厂修理，但他们置之不理。我们建议有关部门对大地营造厂贿赂干部和偷工减料的行为调查处理。　  冯广文　王桂山
