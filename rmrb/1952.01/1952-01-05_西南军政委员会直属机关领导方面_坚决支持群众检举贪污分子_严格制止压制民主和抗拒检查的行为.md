Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd. Leading bodies of various directly subordinate organizations of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee are resolutely stopping cadres at all levels from suppressing democracy and resisting inspection in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. The Party Committee of the Directly Subordinate Organizations of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee of the CPC held a discipline inspection meeting on the 29th of last month, requiring discipline inspection organizations at all levels to strictly safeguard and enforce Party discipline during the movement. Party members who resist inspection must be subjected to disciplinary sanctions. At the same time, all Party members in directly subordinate organizations are required to take the lead in inspecting corruption and waste.

    This determination on the part of the leadership has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of Party and non-Party cadres. When Yang Xinhai (Communist Party member), chief of the Wage Section of the Labor Department of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, was reported for embezzlement, he flew into a rage and cursed the person who reported him. After learning about this, the Party Committee of the Directly Subordinate Organizations of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee of the CPC decided to give Yang Xinhai the punishment of temporarily suspending his Party membership. Non-Party cadres in the Wage Section were all moved and said, "The Communist Party is truly selfless and serves the people." Wang Fengming, director of the Storage and Transportation Office of the Southwest District Company of the China Native Produce Company, suppressed democracy and fueled the arrogance of some embezzlers. After understanding this situation, the company leadership immediately removed Wang Fengming from his leadership position. The enthusiasm of the general staff of the Storage and Transportation Office has been greatly enhanced as a result, and they immediately reported several cases of embezzlement. Because they lost their support, the embezzlers had no choice but to confess their embezzlement facts.

    西南军政委员会直属机关领导方面
    坚决支持群众检举贪污分子
    严格制止压制民主和抗拒检查的行为
    【新华社重庆三日电】西南军政委员会各直属机关的领导方面坚决制止各级干部在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中压制民主，抗拒检查的行为。中共西南军政委员会直属机关党委员会曾在上月二十九日召开纪律检查会议，要求各级纪律检查组织在运动中严格维护和执行党的纪律，对抗拒检查的党员必须予以纪律制裁；同时要求直属机关全体党员带头检查贪污、浪费现象。
    领导方面的这种决心，大大鼓舞了党和非党干部的积极性。西南军政委员会劳动部工资科长杨辛亥（共产党员）被人检举有贪污行为时，暴跳如雷，谩骂检举人。中共西南军政委员会直属机关党委员会知道这件事后，决定给杨辛亥以暂时停止党籍的处分。工资科的非党干部都感动地说“共产党真是大公无私、为人民服务的政党”。中国土产公司西南区公司储运室主任王凤鸣压制民主，助长了某些贪污分子的气焰。公司领导方面了解这一情况后，立即解除王凤鸣的领导工作。储运室一般工作人员的积极性都因此大为提高，他们立即检举出几起贪污事件；贪污分子也因为失去凭藉，只好坦白出了自己的贪污事实。
