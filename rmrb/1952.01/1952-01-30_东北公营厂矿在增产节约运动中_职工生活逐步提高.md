Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 29th: The living standards and collective welfare of workers in state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China have been gradually improving with the rapid restoration and development of production. Especially since the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement last year, this improvement has become even more significant. Currently, the average actual monthly wage of each worker in various factories and mines is equivalent to 235.4 percent of the wage earned in 1948. The supplementary wages (funds for workers' medical care, education, culture, and labor protection) in various factories and mines have also been increasing year by year. In 1949, the Northeast People's Government stipulated that supplementary wages should be equivalent to 9 percent of the basic wage. In 1950, this was increased to 11.5 percent for heavy industry departments and 9.5 percent for light industry departments. Starting last year, in order to more rationally take care of workers working under different labor conditions, supplementary wages were further divided into three categories: (1) Workers working underground in mines and in high-heat (or toxic chemical industry) conditions in factories were raised to 13.5 percent; (2) General heavy industry workers were raised to 12.5 percent; (3) General light industry workers were raised to 11.5 percent. As a result, workers' medical conditions have greatly improved. In addition, working environments and machinery that are detrimental to workers' health and safety have generally been equipped with protective, ventilation, and lighting equipment.

At the same time, the government also has regulations for subsidy wages and "factory director funds." Subsidy wages are equivalent to 13 to 15 percent of the basic wage. The "factory director fund" was stipulated in 1950 to be 10 percent of the above-plan profit, and in 1951 it far exceeded this figure.

Since 1949, the state has allocated large amounts of funds every year for the construction of various welfare projects for workers. There are now 1,729 worker libraries and more than 4,000 clubs in various factories and mines.

    东北公营厂矿在增产节约运动中
    职工生活逐步提高
    【新华社沈阳二十九日电】东北公营厂、矿职工生活和集体福利事业，已随着生产的迅速恢复和发展而逐步提高。特别自去年开展增产节约运动以来，这种提高就更加显著。目前，各厂、矿平均每个职工每月所得的实际工资，相当于一九四八年所得工资百分之二百三十五点四。各厂、矿的附加工资（供职工医药、文教和劳动保护的费用）也逐年增加。一九四九年东北人民政府规定附加工资应相当于基本工资的百分之九，一九五零年各重工业部门增加到百分之十一点五，轻工业部门也增加到百分之九点五。去年开始，为了更加合理地照顾在不同劳动条件下工作的职工，附加工资又改分为三类：（一）凡在矿山内的井下和工厂内的高热（或带有毒素的化学工业）条件下工作的工人，提高到百分之十三点五；（二）一般重工业工人提高到百分之十二点五；（三）一般的轻工业工人提高到百分之十一点五。因此，职工的医药条件有了很大的改善。此外，凡是有碍工人身体健康、生命安全的工作环境和机器，一般地也都增添了防护、通风和照明等设备。
    同时，政府还有补助工资和“厂长基金”的规定。补助工资相当于基本工资的百分之十三到百分之十五。“厂长基金”，一九五零年规定为超计划利润的百分之十，而一九五一年已远超过此数。
    一九四九年以来，国家每年都拨出大量经费，为职工进行各种福利事业的工程建筑。各厂、矿的职工图书馆现在已有一千七百二十九处，俱乐部有四千多个。
