The Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Issue 122 has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "Marxist-Leninist Education for New Party Members," which states: Communist and Workers' Parties represent the social-political and national interests of the working people. In all countries, Communist and Workers' Parties stand at the forefront of the struggle for peace, against war preparations, and against imperialist conspiracies to launch new aggression. Therefore, hundreds of millions of ordinary people in various countries regard the Communist and Workers' Parties as their own, and place great concern in their growth and expansion. The editorial continues: The glorious Chinese Communist Party has opened the road to socialism for the Chinese people, and it is successfully leading the Chinese people in building a new life. While absorbing the outstanding sons and daughters of China, it skillfully educates them. In the People's Democratic countries, the composition of the Communist and Workers' Parties has undergone significant changes in recent years. They have greatly expanded by absorbing a large number of new party members. However, the young party members still lack combat-related revolutionary experience, are not politically mature enough, and even less so have a theoretical foundation. Therefore, carrying out systematic work with the new party members and paying attention to their political education is a major task of the Party. The editorial points out: In training all party members and new party members, especially in helping them establish a world outlook, the first step is to educate them on the Party: to study the Party Constitution, Party history, and the Party's basic resolutions, to study the biographies of Lenin and Stalin, and to study the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course." The most important task for new party members is to instill in them the spirit of strict adherence to Party discipline, a responsible attitude towards the tasks of the Party, and Bolshevik vigilance and an irreconcilable fighting spirit against the conspiracies of hostile elements and all deviations from the Party's general line. At the same time, a Communist Party member is a leader of the masses and must be a model for non-Party people in all aspects. Therefore, Party organizations at all levels must cultivate these qualities in new party members from the first day they obtain Party membership. The editorial concludes: The Communist and Workers' Parties, using the experience of the CPSU (B), their own experiences, and daily practice to educate new party members, will surely be able to further strengthen their ranks, enhance their combat effectiveness, and increase their influence and prestige among the masses.

This issue publishes an article by Valko Chervenkov, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, entitled "Bulgaria Advances on the Road of Socialist Industrialization." Chervenkov said: Under the leadership of the Communist Party, thanks to the assistance of the great Soviet Union, and through close cooperation with the People's Democratic countries, the Bulgarian people are advancing along the road of socialist industrialization. Chervenkov pointed out: Before the establishment of the People's Democratic system, Bulgaria's economic development was extremely backward. But after liberation, Bulgaria adopted the policy and measures of industrialization, implemented a two-year plan from 1947 to 1948, and began implementing a five-year plan in 1949 to lay the foundation for a socialist economy and culture. As a result of unprecedentedly rapid and large-scale construction, the number of new enterprises starting production has been continuously increasing, and industrial output has been steadily rising. By the end of 1948, the total industrial output had exceeded the pre-war level by 85 percent; in 1949, it increased by 30 percent compared with 1948; and in 1950, it increased by 23.3 percent compared with 1949. By the end of 1951, industrial output could reach 97.3 percent of the 1953 level stipulated in the five-year plan. In the basic industrial sectors, the five-year plan can be completed within three years. Chervenkov emphasized that the great achievements in developing the national economy are the result of the heroic and conscious labor of the working class and all working people. The majority of workers across the country and an increasing number of factories in various regions have participated in the socialist production competition. Hundreds of socialist labor heroes have emerged among the workers. Now, the Bulgarian working class is steadily fighting to save funds and materials, improve quality, increase the variety of goods, and reduce production costs.

This issue publishes an excerpt from a report by Mátyás Rákosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, at the plenary session of the Party Central Committee in November 1951: "Urgent Problems of the Hungarian National Economy." Rákosi pointed out: Hungary's industrial output in the first ten months of 1951 increased by 29.1 percent compared with the same period last year. Labor productivity in heavy industry increased by 16.5 percent. In agriculture, the 1951 harvest was the best since Hungary's liberation. The socialist sector in agriculture developed rapidly, and the cultivated area of ​​production cooperatives and state farms accounted for 24.6 percent of all arable land. Rákosi pointed out: Due to economic achievements, the bumper harvest, and the people's enthusiastic payment of public grain, it is now possible to abolish the rationing system and restore the free sale of agricultural products, which is another victory for the people's democratic system. On the other hand, in order to combat speculation and protect the interests of the working people, we must change the price policy adopted for many commodities; we must increase wages, family allowances, and pensions.

This issue also publishes an article by Gevert, member of the Central Control Commission of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, entitled "The Tito Fascist Clique's Spies Are the Enemies of the German Working Class," exposing the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to organize a spy network in West Germany, using Tito's fascists to infiltrate the German Communist Party, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and progressive organizations to carry out subversive activities. This issue also published a book review entitled "A Fighting Weapon for Organizing the Work of Party Activists," introducing the experience of the Italian Communist Party in publishing the bi-weekly "Activist's Handbook."

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二二期已经出版。
    本期发表题为“新党员的马克思—列宁主义教育”的社论说：共产党与工人党代表着劳动人民的社会—政治利益和民族利益。在所有的国家里，共产党与工人党都站在斗争的最前线来争取和平，反对准备战争，反对帝国主义者阴谋发动新的侵略。因此，各国千百万普通人民都把共产党与工人党看成他们自己的党，而对于它们的成长和壮大寄以莫大的关怀。社论接着说：光荣的中国共产党为中国人民开辟了走向社会主义的道路，它正在顺利地领导中国人民建设新生活。它一面吸收中国的优秀儿女，一面很熟练地教育他们。在人民民主国家，共产党与工人党的组成成分近年来发生了很大的变化。由于吸收了大批新党员，它们是大大地扩大了。但是年轻的党员还缺乏战斗的革命锻炼，在政治上也不够成熟，更谈不上理论基础。因此对新的党员进行有系统的工作，注意他们的政治教育是党的一个主要任务。社论指出：党在训练全体党员和新党员方面，特别是帮他们树立世界观方面，第一步就是使他们受党的教育：学习党章、党史和党的基本决议，学习列宁和斯大林的传记，学习联共（布）党史简明教程。对新党员的最重要的工作就是使他们具有严守党纪的精神，对党的任务有负责的精神，对敌对分子的阴谋以及一切离开党的总路线的偏向具有布尔什维克的警惕性和不调和的斗争性。同时，共产党员是人民群众的领袖，他必须在各方面都是非党人民的模范。因此党的各级组织必须从新党员取得党籍的第一天起就培养他们的这种品质。社论结语说：共产党与工人党以联共
    （布）的经验、以它们自己的经验和日常的实践来教育新党员，一定能够进一步加强它们的队伍，提高战斗性，增加在群众中的影响和威望。
    本期刊载了保加利亚共产党中央委员会政治局委员于哥夫的“保加利亚在社会主义工业化的道路上迈进”一文。于哥夫说：保加利亚人民在共产党的领导下，由于伟大的苏联的援助，以及与人民民主国家的紧密合作，正在沿着社会主义工业化的道路前进。于哥夫指出：保加利亚在人民民主制度建立以前，经济发展是极端落后的。但在解放以后，保加利亚就采取了实行工业化的方针和措施，在一九四七年到一九四八年实行了两年计划，并在一九四九年开始实行奠定社会主义经济和文化基础的五年计划。由于进行空前迅速的和大规模的建设的结果，开工生产的新企业不断增加，工业产量已在稳步上升。在一九四八年底，工业总产量已超过战前水平百分之八十五；一九四九年比一九四八年增加了百分之三十；一九五○年比一九四九年增加百分之二十三点三。在一九五一年底，工业产量可以达到五年计划中所规定的一九五三年水平的百分之九十七点三。在基本工业部门，五年计划在三年内即可完成。于哥夫强调指出：在发展国民经济上的巨大成就是工人阶级和全体劳动人民英勇和自觉劳动的结果。全国大多数工人和各地越来越多的工厂参加了社会主义生产竞赛。工人中间涌现了成百个社会主义劳动英雄，现在，保加利亚工人阶级正在稳步地为节约资金与物资、提高质量、增加货物种类、降低生产成本而进行斗争。
    本期刊载了匈牙利劳动人民党总书记拉科西在一九五一年十一月在党中央委员会全体会议上的报告摘要：“匈牙利国民经济的迫切问题”。拉科西指出：匈牙利的工业生产量在一九五一年头十个月内比前年同期增加了百分之二十九点一。重工业的劳动生产率上升了百分之十六点五。在农业方面，一九五一年的收成是匈牙利解放以来最好的一次。农业中的社会主义部分发展得很快，生产合作社和国营农场的耕种面积已占全部可耕地的百分之二十四点六。拉科西指出：由于经济上的成就，由于丰收和人民踊跃缴纳公粮，现在已可以废除配给制，恢复农产品的自由销售，这是人民民主制度的又一胜利。另一方面，为了打击投机倒把和保护劳动人民的利益，我们必须改变对许多物品所采取的物价政策；必须提高工资、家庭补助金和养老金。
    本期还发表了德国统一社会党中央监察委员盖夫凯的“铁托法西斯集团的特务是德国工人阶级的敌人”一文，揭露了美帝国主义在西德组织谍报网，利用铁托法西斯分子混入德国共产党、德国统一社会党和进步组织，来进行颠覆活动的阴谋。本期还发表了题为“组织党活动分子的工作的战斗武器”的书评，介绍了意大利共产党出版“活动分子手册”双周刊的经验。（新华社）
