    Learning from the Great Lenin's Teachings in the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy
    —Commemorating the Twenty-Eighth Anniversary of Lenin's Death—

    Today is the twenty-eighth anniversary of the death of Lenin, the great leader and teacher of the world's working class. For twenty-eight years, the conscious working people of the world have remembered Lenin and used Lenin's teachings as a guide for their revolutionary struggles. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people fully understand that our revolutionary struggle over the past thirty years has been inseparable from the name of the great Lenin.

    It was under the light of Leninism, especially the great October Socialist Revolution led by Lenin, and with the valuable assistance of the Bolshevik Party of Lenin and Stalin and the Soviet people, that the Chinese working class and the Chinese people stood firm and engaged in struggle. The Chinese Communist Party, established and developed in the model of the Bolshevik Party, led the broad masses of the Chinese working people in a long, arduous, and tortuous struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, achieving a great historic victory and establishing the People's Republic of China led by the working class. After its founding, the People's Republic of China immediately declared itself a component of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, immediately established close friendship with the Soviet Union, and successfully promoted the arduous task of economic reconstruction with the assistance of the Soviet Union. It is clear, therefore, that the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people is closely linked with the name of the great Lenin.

    In commemorating the twenty-eighth anniversary of Lenin's death, every conscious Chinese working person should draw new strength from Lenin's cause and teachings. Currently, the Chinese people are striving to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and are vigorously and swiftly carrying out a large-scale struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and are determined to win a complete victory in this struggle with all their might, because this is a necessary prerequisite for continuing to resist America and aid Korea and preparing for large-scale construction. Lenin's instructions on this issue are particularly worth remembering.

    After the October Revolution, in order to save the economy destroyed by the imperialist war and to build socialism, Lenin strongly advocated thrift and using strict discipline in production labor. In his article "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government," published on April 28, 1918, Lenin pointed out: "Accurate and honest calculation of money, economic saving, no laziness, no embezzlement of public funds, and the strictest discipline in labor—these slogans, which the bourgeoisie once used to conceal its rule as an exploiting class, were rightly ridiculed by the revolutionary proletariat, but now, after the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, they have become the urgent and main slogans. On the one hand, the effective implementation of these slogans by the working masses is the only condition for saving the country, which was brought to the brink of death by the imperialist war and the imperialist robbers (led by Kerensky); on the other hand, the effective implementation of these slogans by the Soviet government, in its own way and according to its own laws, is a necessary and sufficient condition for the complete victory of socialism." Although the current situation in our country is different from that in the Soviet Union at that time, do we not need to "calculate money, save money, not be lazy, not embezzle public funds, and observe the strictest discipline in labor" in order to continue to resist America and aid Korea and for the cause of new democratic construction? Obviously, we must strive to increase production and practice economy in order to ensure the complete victory of new democracy.

    Lenin had unparalleled hatred for all corruption phenomena and resolutely advocated the most severe sanctions against them. On May 2, 1918, the Moscow People's Court tried a case of several bribe-takers. The court proved the defendants guilty but gave a very light sentence. Lenin was greatly angered by such a verdict. In a letter, he wrote: "It is a shameful act for Communists and revolutionaries not to shoot bribe-takers and to give such ridiculously weak and light sentences. Such bribe-taking comrades must be subjected to public trial and expelled from the party..." A few days later, Lenin wrote to the People's Commissar of Justice, in which he suggested: "Immediately expedite the introduction of a bill stipulating that the penalty for bribery (receiving bribes, giving bribes, and other bribery activities, etc.) should be at least ten years of imprisonment and ten years of hard labor." Today, we also urgently need to formulate regulations on punishing corruption, giving all corrupt elements severe legal sanctions, from sentencing to imprisonment, hard labor, and even shooting them!

    The harm of waste phenomena is often ten times or a hundred times greater than that of corruption. Therefore, while fighting to eliminate corruption, we must also resolutely eliminate waste. In his report to the Fourth Congress of the Communist International on November 13, 1922, Lenin said: "At present, the situation of our heavy industry is still extremely difficult, at least. But I think we have been able to save some resources. We will continue to do so in the future. Although this source often comes from the people, we still have to save in every possible way. Now we are studying how to reduce our state budget and reduce the personnel of our state organs. ...In any case, we should reduce the personnel of our state organs, and we must save as much as possible. We are implementing savings in all aspects, even in school funding. This is a matter of course, because we know that without saving heavy industry and without restoring heavy industry, we cannot build any industry, and without industry, we cannot maintain our position as an independent country at all. We know this very well." This instruction is also very relevant to our country today. On March 2, 1923, in his thesis entitled "Better Fewer, But Better," Lenin said: "The state we should strive to build is one where workers can maintain their leadership over the peasants, maintain the peasants' trust in them, and completely eliminate any traces of waste in their social relations through great savings. We must make our state organs as economical as possible. We must eradicate all traces of waste in our state organs, and there are still many such traces left in our state organs by Tsarist Russia and its bureaucratic capitalist organs." After overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, have our people not seen many traces left in our state organs by the bureaucratic capitalist organs of the Kuomintang everywhere? We can have no other way to deal with these evil traces except to resolutely eradicate them.

    In order to completely eradicate corruption and waste, we must simultaneously wage a relentless struggle against all bureaucratic phenomena. In the aforementioned article "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government," Lenin taught us that "there should be more and more diverse forms and methods of supervision from below in order to prevent any possibility of the Soviet regime deteriorating and to tirelessly eradicate the weeds of bureaucracy." In many other works and speeches, Lenin repeatedly warned us to resolutely fight against all kinds of bureaucratic elements. This is an extremely complex and arduous struggle, and we must carry out this struggle universally in cities and villages, in all corners, without exception.

    We should also pay special attention in the current great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to further purify our party and revolutionary ranks and remove all incorrigible corrupt elements. In his pamphlet "On the Food Tax," published in April 1921, Lenin warned against "the old bureaucrats, landlords, bourgeois elements, and other dregs who have sneaked into the Communist Party to engage in malfeasance, and who sometimes commit various violent and bullying harmful acts against the peasants," and resolutely advocated "cleaning them out." We should do this completely, and we are doing it.

    Today, on the occasion of commemorating the twenty-eighth anniversary of the death of the great Lenin, reviewing Lenin's teachings has great practical significance. Although what we have quoted here is only a part of Lenin's remarks on practicing thrift, opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy, and although these remarks were made in response to the specific situation in the Soviet Union after the October Revolution, our cadres at all levels should seriously study and deeply understand Lenin's teachings so as to lead and conduct the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to achieve a complete victory rapidly.

    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争中学习伟大列宁的遗训
    ——纪念列宁逝世二十八周年——
    今天是全世界工人阶级的伟大领袖和导师——列宁逝世二十八周年的纪念日。二十八年来，全世界觉悟的劳动人民，都怀念着列宁，并以列宁的学说，作为自己的革命斗争的指南。中国工人阶级和中国人民完全懂得，我们三十多年来的革命斗争是和伟大的列宁的名字分不开的。
    正是在列宁主义，特别是列宁所领导的伟大十月社会主义革命的光芒照耀之下，正是在列宁、斯大林的布尔塞维克党和苏联人民的宝贵援助之下，中国工人阶级和中国人民坚强地站立起来从事斗争了。以布尔塞维克党为模范而建立和发展起来的中国共产党，领导了中国广大劳动人民，与帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义进行了长期的、艰苦的、曲折的斗争，取得了伟大的历史性的胜利，建立了以工人阶级为领导的中华人民共和国。中华人民共和国成立以后，立即宣布自己是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的组成部分，立即与苏联建立了亲密的友谊，并且在苏联的援助下胜利地推进了艰巨的经济重建工作。由此可见，中国工人阶级和中国人民的革命斗争，和伟大列宁的名字是紧紧地联系在一起的。
    在纪念列宁逝世二十八周年的时候，每一个觉悟的中国劳动人民，都应当从列宁的事业和学说中取得新的力量。在目前，中国人民正努力开展增产节约运动，并正大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地开展大规模的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争，并决以全力争取这个斗争的彻底胜利，因为这对于继续抗美援朝和准备大规模建设，都是一个必要的前提。列宁在这个问题上的指示，是特别值得我们记忆的。
    列宁在十月革命以后，为了挽救被帝国主义战争所破坏的经济，为了建设社会主义，曾极力提倡节约，提倡用严格的纪律从事生产劳动。在一九一八年四月二十八日所发表的“苏维埃政权底当前任务”一文中，列宁指出：“精确而诚实地计算金钱，节省经济，不懒惰，不盗公肥私，在劳动中遵守最严格的纪律——正是这些口号，从前资产阶级用以掩饰自己这剥削阶级的统治地位时，曾为革命的无产者所正当讥笑过的，而现时在推翻资产阶级以后，却已变成目前迫切的主要的口号了。一方面，劳动群众切实执行这些口号，便是挽救被帝国主义战争和帝国主义强盗们（以克伦斯基为首）弄得半死半活的国家的唯一条件；另一方面，由苏维埃政权，用自己的方法，根据自己的法令来切实执行这些口号，又是社会主义彻底胜利所必要的和足够的条件。”我国目前的情况，虽然和当时苏联的情况不同，但是，我们为了继续抗美援朝，为了新民主主义的建设事业，难道不需要“计算金钱，节省经济，不懒惰，不盗公肥私，在劳动中遵守最严格的纪律”吗？显然的，我们必须努力增产节约，才能保证新民主主义的彻底胜利。
    对于一切贪污现象，列宁以无比的憎恨，坚决主张必须予以最严厉的制裁。一九一八年五月二日，莫斯科人民法庭曾审理几个受贿者底案件，法庭证明了被告有罪，却判决很轻。列宁对这样的判决大为震怒，他在一封信中写道：“不把受贿者枪毙，而给了这样开玩笑似地软弱而轻微的判决，这对共产党人及革命者乃是可耻的行为。这类受贿的同志，必须交给舆论裁判，并开除出党……”过了几天，列宁写信给司法人民委员，在信上他建议道：“立刻赶快提出一个法案，规定对于贿赂（收贿、赠贿以及其他贿赂行为等等）的惩罚，应该至少是十年监禁和十年苦役。”我们今天也完全需要制订关于惩治贪污的条例，对一切贪污分子给以法律的严厉制裁，从判处徒刑、罚以苦役，直到枪毙他们！
    浪费现象的为害，往往是十倍百倍于贪污。因此，在为肃清贪污现象而斗争的同时，还必须坚决消灭浪费现象。列宁于一九二二年十一月十三日在共产国际第四次代表大会上的报告中说：“现时，我国重工业情况，至少还是极度困难的。但我认为，我们已能多少节省一批资财。今后我们也还要这样做去。虽然这种来源往往是出自人民身上，但此刻我们总还得百般节省。现在我们正在研究怎样缩减我们的国家预算，裁减我们国家机关的人员。……我们无论如何，应当缩减我们的国家机关人员，我们必须尽量节省。我们在各方面，甚至在学校经费方面，都实行节省。这是理所当然的，因为我们知道：不挽救重工业，不恢复重工业，我们就不能建成任何工业，而没有工业，我们就根本不能维持我们之为独立国家的地位。这点我们知道得很清楚。”这个指示，对于现时的我国也是十分切合需要的。一九二三年三月二日，列宁在以“宁肯少些，但要好些”为题的论文中又说：“我们所应当努力建成的国家，是要工人能够保持他们对于农民的领导，保持农民对于他们的信任，并以极大节省办法把自己社会关系中任何浪费现象的任何遗迹铲除干净。我们应当使我们国家机关尽量节省。我们必须把国家机关中所有一切浪费现象的遗迹铲除干净，而沙皇俄罗斯及其官僚资本主义机关所遗留在我们国家机关中的这种遗迹，尚是很多的。”我国人民在推翻了国民党反动统治之后，不是也到处看到由国民党官僚资本主义机关所遗留在我们国家机关中的许多遗迹吗？我们对于这些罪恶的遗迹，除了坚决加以铲除以外，再也不能有别的办法了。
    为要彻底铲除贪污浪费现象，我们必须同时向一切官僚主义现象做无情的斗争。在前述“苏维埃政权底当前任务”文中，列宁就曾教导我们“应该有愈加纷繁的自下的监督形式和方法，以便杜绝恶化苏维埃政权的任何可能性，以便再三不倦地铲除官僚主义的莠草。”列宁在其他许多著作和讲演中，都曾经一再告诫我们要坚决同各式各样的官僚主义分子作斗争。这是一个极端复杂和艰苦的斗争，我们必须在城市和农村，在一切角落里，无例外地普遍展开这个斗争。
    我们还应该特别注意在目前所进行的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争中，进一步使我们的党和革命队伍纯洁起来，把一切不可救药的贪污腐化分子清除出去。列宁在一九二一年四月所发表的“论粮食税”的小册子中，曾警告“那些混入到共产党里来的旧官僚、地主、资产者及其他败类之从中舞弊，他们有时对农民作出种种暴戾欺凌的有害行为”，而坚决主张对于他们要“实行清洗”。我们完全应该这样做，也正在这样做。
    在纪念伟大列宁逝世二十八周年的今天，我们温习列宁的遗训是有重大的实际意义的。在这里，我们所引述的虽然只是列宁关于厉行节约、反对贪污、反对浪费和反对官僚主义的一部分言论，这些言论虽然是针对十月革命后的苏联具体情况而发的，但是，我们各级干部，都应该认真学习并深刻领会列宁的遗训，以便领导和进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争迅速取得彻底的胜利。
