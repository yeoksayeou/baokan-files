    A Runaway Mine Car Accident at the Nanguan Pit of the Fujiatan Coal Mine Caused Significant Losses
    Editor: The bureaucratic work style of certain cadres at the Fujiatan Coal Mine in Shanxi Province has caused significant losses in production. On the evening of January 2nd, Kong Qingming, the winch operator, and Guo Daniu, the hook-up worker, at the Nanguan Pit of this mine, started the ten-horsepower electric winch. They violated labor discipline and privately increased the load (from four empty cars to seventeen), resulting in the steel cable breaking and a runaway mine car. When the mine car pushers underground, including Yin Shoubai, discovered this, they urgently used pit props to block the runaway car, preventing casualties. This runaway car incident damaged 41 meters of steel cable, resulted in a loss of 250 tons of coal due to work stoppage, and a total loss of 26.87 million yuan including repair costs. The causes of the accident, in addition to the irresponsibility of the workers and the foreman, were mainly due to the bureaucratic work style of certain cadres. For example, Hu Youzhen, the head of the engineering section, was often busy with routine office matters and did not pay attention to the work at the pithead. Zhao Dengzhou, who was responsible for this work, only listened to reports and stamped documents, and did not seriously inspect the implementation of various systems, nor did he strictly deal with liability accidents. The mine's leading cadres have now dealt with this matter.

    富家滩煤矿南关坑发生跑车事故损失很大
    编辑同志：山西省富家滩煤矿某些干部的官僚主义作风，造成生产上很大的损失。一月二日晚，这个矿南关坑开绞车工人孔庆明和挂钩工人郭大牛，开动十马力电绞车。他们违反劳动纪律，私自增加载重量（从四个空车加到十七个），结果钢丝绳崩断，放了野车。坑下推车工人尹寿白等发觉后，急用坑木挡住野车，才没有发生伤亡事故。这次跑车损坏钢丝绳四十一公尺，因停工少产煤二百五十吨，加上修理等费，共损失二千六百八十七万元。产生事故的原因，除了肇事工人和领班技术人员不负责任外，主要是某些干部有官僚主义作风。比如工务股长胡友珍经常忙于办公室里的日常事务，不注意坑口的工作；负责这项工作的赵登州只是听汇报，盖图章，也不认真地检查各项制度的执行情况，对责任事故都没有严格处理。现在矿上的领导干部对这件事已作了处理。
