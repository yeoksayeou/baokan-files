Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th. The Central Committee of the US-British POWs Peace Committee in Korea has issued an open letter protesting the unreasonable US proposal for a one-for-one exchange of POWs and demanding that the US agree to release and repatriate all POWs. The letter is signed by Eugene, Chairman of the Central Committee of the US-British POWs Peace Committee, Cox, Vice-Chairman, Carter, Secretary, and six other committee members.

The letter states: We, the undersigned members of the Central Committee of the US-British POWs Peace Committee, express the views of all UN POWs.

The Geneva Convention clearly and specifically stipulates that all prisoners of war shall be exchanged and repatriated immediately after the cessation of hostilities. However, the United States, one of the signatories to this Convention, has proposed at the armistice talks a suggestion advocating the exchange of prisoners of war on a one-for-one basis. This not only directly violates the Geneva Convention, but also sets a precedent for a belligerent country to detain prisoners of war.

The letter questions the true purpose of the unreasonable proposal put forward by the US, and points out: The proposal insisted upon by the US has caused great disappointment to the US and British POWs who are eager to return home as soon as possible, and will continue to cause pain and anxiety to the families of the POWs. The letter rebukes the US proposal, saying: Although it is now the 20th century, it seems to us that we are being treated as commodities to be bought and sold on the auction block for barter.

The letter then quotes several American, Turkish, and Filipino POWs, who unanimously condemned the US for deliberately delaying the negotiations and demanded an early end to the war and a return home.

The letter concludes: We are not begging but demanding that the UN military delegation make fair and sincere efforts to restore peace in Korea and to immediately repatriate every prisoner of war, so that prisoners of war can return home and reunite with their families.

    美英战俘和平委员会发表公开信
    斥美方以战俘作买卖
    主张停战获得协议后交换全部战俘
    【新华社平壤十二日电】在朝鲜的美英战俘拥护和平委员会中央委员会顷发表公开信，抗议美方提出的一对一交换战俘的无理提案，并要求美方同意释放和遣送全部战俘。信末署名的有美英战俘拥护和平委员会中央委员会主席牛金特、副主席柯克斯、秘书卡特尔以及委员六人。
    信中说：我们这些在下面署名的美英战俘和平委员会中央委员会委员在这里表示全体联合国军战俘的意见。
    日内瓦公约明白而具体地规定：在敌对行为停止以后，立即交换并遣回全部战俘。但是，这个公约的签字国之一的美国，却在停战谈判会议上提出一项建议，主张依照一个换一个的原则来交换战俘。这不但直接违背了日内瓦公约，而且还为一个交战国扣留战俘的行动创立了先例。
    该信就美方所提出的无理提案的真实目的提出质问；并指出：美方所坚持的提案，使渴望早日重返家园的美英战俘们陷于极大的失望，并将使战俘的家属继续痛苦不安。该信斥责美方提案说：虽然现在已是二十世纪，但在我们看来，我们却是被当做放在拍卖台上买卖的商品来进行物物交换。
    该信接着引述了几个美国、土耳其、菲律宾战俘的话，他们一致斥责美方故意拖延谈判，并要求早日停止战争，重返家园。
    该信最后说：我们并不是乞求而是要求联合国军代表团为恢复朝鲜和平，并为立即遣回每一个战俘而作正大光明的和诚恳的努力，这样战俘们才可以重返家园，和他们的亲人团聚。
