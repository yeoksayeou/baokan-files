The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Beijing Municipal Youth Federation are vigorously mobilizing shop assistants and street youths to participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. From December 25th to 30th, 1951, the Municipal Committee of the League and the Municipal Youth Federation organized 238 university League members and 44 League cadres from government offices to assist the League District Work Committees and shop employees' unions in holding 33 symposiums for young shop assistants and 13 report meetings, with approximately 9,200 people participating; 170 symposiums and report meetings for street youths were held, with over 16,400 people participating. These meetings publicized the significance of this movement and the responsibilities of young people. Young people participated in these meetings very enthusiastically. After the meetings, they all felt that they had a better understanding of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. They said: "Corruption and waste undermine our efforts to increase production and practice thrift, hindering our progress toward socialism." "Corruption is a legacy of the old society, and we will certainly not allow it." They also stated: "The government inspects from above, and we report and expose from below, coordinating from top to bottom, so that corrupt elements have nowhere to hide." Some people dispelled their original concerns, such as a young shop assistant in the Sixth District who said: "I am with the manager every day, and I know very well his tricks of bribery and tax evasion. I was afraid to speak out for fear of being fired by the capitalist, but now I know that the Communist Party and the People's Government are determined to eliminate corrupt elements, so what do I have to worry about!" Many active shop assistants and street youths asked the League District Work Committee about the conditions for joining the League after the meeting, wanting to strive to join the League in this movement.

Shop assistants and youth representatives and active youth members from street League branches and the Democratic Youth Federation, under the leadership of the League District Work Committee, cooperated with shop employees' unions, police stations, and night schools to carry out publicity and unite young people. A shop assistant League branch in the Fifth District, with 20 League members, united more than 100 young shop assistants and reported 73 cases of corruption, bribery, and tax evasion. League members carried out publicity in their own units through means such as reading newspapers, and dispelled the concerns of other shop assistants through symposiums and individual talks. Youth representatives and active street youth members in the Fourth District used night schools as a base to form liaison groups, established contact with other street youths, and carried out publicity and mobilization among them. Liu Tiansheng, an executive committee member of the Youth Federation and a peddler, united active young peddlers in the Shuncheng Street Market, carried out publicity using blackboards and loudspeakers, and reported many cases of corruption and theft in warehouses.

According to incomplete statistics, about 469 cases have now been reported by shop assistants and street youths throughout the city (some of which are only clues), with 73 cases reported in the Fifth District alone. Shop assistants are familiar with the internal affairs of shops and have reported many cases of bribery and tax evasion by capitalists. For example, the owner of a certain tea shop bribed a certain cadre of the tax bureau 4 million yuan, but recorded it as 4 million yuan for house repairs; the shop assistant knew that the house had been confiscated and could not be repaired, so he exposed this matter. The tax bureau is still continuing its investigation. Young shop assistants have also exposed many cases of embezzlement and theft by government office cadres, effectively cooperating with the anti-corruption work in government offices. Shop assistants of a certain automobile shop exposed the fact that the capitalist and certain government office car drivers stole gasoline and parts, enabling relevant government offices to strengthen their inspection and dispel the paralysis that they thought there were no problems with the car drivers. Young shop assistants in restaurants provided clues about unscrupulous merchants colluding with cadres to indulge in lavish eating and drinking, enabling relevant government offices to further investigate. Shop assistants in other shops such as Western medicine, seafood, stationery, and electrical supplies have also reported cases of embezzlement and theft by relevant government office cadres. In addition to shop assistants, tricycle and flatbed cart workers, because unscrupulous merchants often hire them to pull smuggled goods, have exposed many smuggling situations; young peddlers, because they have business dealings with state warehouses, have exposed many cases of state warehouse cadres accepting bribes, stealing and selling materials, and harming national interests. Housewives have exposed corruption in cooperatives, district business offices, and cadres living in the same courtyard. In short, young people from all walks of life, with tens of thousands of eyes, are helping the government to expose the dirty and dark facts of corruption.

Reporting is not always smooth sailing, but rather goes through ideological struggles. There are thoughts among young people such as "fear of retaliation," "fear of unemployment," "don't kick other people's rice bowls, doing something immoral," "there are only clues and no evidence, afraid of incriminating oneself if reporting;" especially among shop assistants, some capitalists use various means to threaten and entice them: threatening with "dismissal;" or saying: "If you report, our shop will be fined to bankruptcy, and you will be finished too." "Giving kickbacks and winning over cadres is also good for our business!" "The government has a way, do what should be done, why are you anxious." (referring to reporting cadres) and enticing them with salary increases, inviting them to dinner, and inviting them to see a play. These have all hindered them from boldly reporting. A shop assistant in the Fifth District did not sleep well for three nights after reporting the capitalist's tax evasion, and was still hesitating at the entrance of the union before finally reporting.

The work of shop assistants and street youths still needs to be deepened and more widely mobilized to report in order to cooperate with the city's anti-corruption work. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the League and the Municipal Youth Federation have decided to cooperate with shop employees' unions to convene meetings of active shop assistants and street youths in various districts to further clarify the significance of this movement and the government's policies, and dispel their ideological concerns. In addition to reports, entertainment programs created by the young masses themselves related to this movement will be used for education at the meeting. After the meeting, they will contact the active members among them and the broader masses of young people to resolutely fight against corruption and waste.

Tianjin shop assistants are enthusiastically launching the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. On January 7th, the shop employees' union convened more than 700 chairmen of grassroots trade unions and accountants of private shops, and held a conference on anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy. At the meeting, Liu Ya, chairman of the shop employees' union committee, pointed out in his mobilization report: shop assistants throughout the city must enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's call and actively participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. This is the most important political work at present. This movement must be used to thoroughly eliminate the enemies hidden within the people, protect the property of the country and the people from being lost, and at the same time save those who have been corrupted by bourgeois ideology. Liu Ya said: The capitalists of many private shops in Tianjin have serious illegal behaviors such as bribery and tax evasion; there are also many phenomena of corruption and acceptance of bribes among shop employees and the trade union itself. He called on shop assistants throughout the city to take action, give play to the leading role of the working class, and bravely and actively participate in the struggle against corruption and bribery. He analyzed and criticized the current ideological concerns and liberal attitudes of some shop employees. Some shop employees know about some situations of corruption and bribery, but they are afraid to report because they do not understand it specifically enough, fearing that what they report will not fully match the facts and cause trouble. Liu Ya pointed out that this understanding is wrong. He said that according to the principle of "the speaker is not guilty, the accuser is not prosecuted, and those who suppress democracy must be punished," even if some shop employees do not know the situations of corruption and bribery very specifically, they should quickly report them to the frugality inspection committee or provide them for the frugality inspection committee's reference. This is an attitude of actively taking responsibility for the interests of the country and the people. Even if there are some discrepancies between the facts reported and the investigation results, that doesn't matter. On the contrary, some shop employees know about some situations of corruption and bribery, but they have many concerns and are unwilling to report them. This is a concrete manifestation of low awareness and lack of concern for the interests of the country and the people. In addition, some shop employees are afraid that reporting will not work, that they will be retaliated against, that their jobs will be affected, etc. These ideological concerns are all unnecessary. He said: Whoever suppresses democracy or plays a destructive role in this struggle will be severely punished.

After Liu Ya's report, everyone discussed and confessed and reported in groups according to industry and region. In the confession and reporting, the enthusiasm of the masses was extremely high, and about 300 cases of corruption and bribery were confessed and reported in one hour. Many shop employees said: "Now a dragnet has been laid, and corrupt and bribery-taking illegal elements will not be able to get away with it if they do not confess." Everyone unanimously expressed that after returning, they would definitely mobilize the vast number of shop employees to report together, and not let a single corrupt or bribery-taking element slip through the net.

The First District Work Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League of Tianjin also convened a conference on the anti-corruption struggle on the evening of January 6th, and young shop employees reported more than 400 cases of bribery on the spot.

    北京市店员、街道青年和天津市店员
    群起揭发贪污行贿受贿事实
    成千成万双眼睛注视着藏在各个角落里的盗贼
    青年团北京市委员会和北京市民主青年联合会大力发动店员和街道青年，参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。自一九五一年十二月二十五日起到三十日止，团市委和市青联组织了二百三十八位大学团员和四十四位机关团干部，协助各区团工委和店员工会，召开了青年店员座谈会三十三次，报告会十三次，参加人数约九千二百多人；召开了街道青年座谈会和报告会共一百七十次，参加人数约一万六千四百余人。这些会上宣传了这次运动的意义和青年的责任。青年们非常踊跃地参加这些会议。会后，他们都感到对于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动有了认识。他们说：“贪污浪费破坏我们增产节约，阻碍我们走向社会主义。”“贪污是旧社会遗留下来的，我们一定不允许。”并表示：“政府从上面检查，我们从下面检举、揭发，上下配合，使贪污分子无处容身。”有的人打消了原先的顾虑，如六区一位青年店员说：“我们每天和掌柜的在一起，他的行贿、漏税花样我知道得很清楚，就是怕说出来，给资方解雇了，现在知道共产党、人民政府是坚决肃清贪污分子的，我还有什么可顾虑的！”许多积极的店员和街道青年会后向团区工委打听入团条件，要在这次运动中争取入团。
    店员和各街道团支部、民主青联的青年代表和青年积极分子在团区工委领导下，配合店员工会、派出所、夜校展开了宣传和团结青年的工作。五区一个店员团支部，二十个团员团结了一百多青年店员，检举贪污、行贿和漏税案七十三件。团员们在自己单位里用读报等方式进行了宣传，并通过座谈会、个别谈话解除其他店员的顾虑。四区青年代表和街道青年积极分子以夜校为据点，组成联络组，和其他街道青年取得联系，向他们进行宣传动员。青联执行委员摊贩刘天升团结了顺城街市场积极青年摊贩，用黑板报、广播筒进行了宣传，并检举了许多仓库的贪污、盗窃案件。
    全市店员和街道青年现在已检举出的案件，据不完全统计约四百六十九件（其中一部分只是线索），仅五区一个区就检举了七十三件。店员熟知商店内情，检举了许多资本家行贿、漏税案件。如某茶庄资方向税局某干部行贿四百万元，却在账上记修理房屋费四百万元；店员知道此处房屋已被充公，不可能修理，就揭发了这件事。税局还在继续追查中。青年店员们还揭发了许多机关干部贪污盗窃事件，有力地配合了机关反贪污工作。某汽车行店员检举了资方和某些机关汽车司机盗窃汽油、零件的事实，使有关机关加强了检查，打消了认为汽车司机没什么问题的麻痹思想。饭馆中青年店员提供了不法商人勾引干部大吃大喝的线索，使有关机关得以进一步追查。其他如西药、海味、文具、电料行等商店店员也都检举了有关的机关干部贪污、盗窃案件。除店员外，三轮车和排子车工人由于不法商人常雇他们拉私货，揭发了许多走私情况；摊贩青年由于和国家仓库有营业来往，揭发了很多国家仓库干部受贿、盗卖物资和损害国家利益的现象。家庭妇女检举了合作社、区营业处、住同院干部的贪污现象。总之，各个方面的青年，成万双眼睛帮助政府揭发着污浊黑暗的贪污事实。
    检举并不是一帆风顺的，而是经过思想斗争的。青年中存在着“怕报复”、“怕失业”、“别踢人家饭碗，作缺德事”、“只有线索没证据，怕检举了反而牵累自己”等思想；尤其在店员中，一些资本家用各种手段威胁利诱他们：用“解雇”威胁；或者说：“你检举，咱们铺子给罚垮，你也完了。”“打回扣，拉拢干部也是为咱们营业好啊！”“政府有办法，该办就办，你何必着急。”（指检举干部）并用加薪、请吃饭、请看戏利诱他们。这些都阻碍了他们大胆进行检举。五区一个店员检举资方漏税，三夜没睡好觉，直到临检举时还在工会门口徘徊，最后终于检举了。
    店员和街道青年工作还须要更深入一步，更广泛地动员他们，进行检举，以配合全市反贪污工作。北京团市委和市青联已决定配合店员工会，在各区普遍召开店员和街道青年积极分子大会，更进一步讲清这次运动的意义和政府的政策，解除他们思想顾虑。会上除报告外，并将青年群众自己创造的与这次运动有关的娱乐节目进行教育。会后将通过他们中间的积极分子和更广大的青年群众取得联系，向贪污、浪费现象作坚决的斗争。

    天津市店员热烈地展开了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。一月七日，店员工会召集各基层工会主席和私营商店会计员七百多人，开了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义大会。大会上，店员工会委员会主席刘亚在动员报告中指出：全市店员必须热烈响应毛主席的号召，积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。这是当前的头等重要的政治工作。要通过这个运动彻底肃清藏在人民内部的敌人，保护国家人民的财产不使受到损失，同时挽救被资产阶级思想所腐蚀的人。刘亚说：天津市许多私营商店的资方，有严重的行贿、漏税等不法行为；店员工人中间和工会本身也有不少贪污受贿现象。他号召全市店员行动起来，发挥工人阶级的领导作用，勇敢地、积极地参加反贪污反行贿斗争。他针对目前某些店员工人的思想顾虑和自由主义的态度进行了分析和批判。目前有些店员，知道一些贪污行贿的情况，因了解不够具体，不敢检举，怕检举后与事实不完全相符，闹出事情来。刘亚指出这种认识是不对的。他说，根据“言者无罪，告者不究，压制民主者必须惩办”的原则，有些店员知道的贪污行贿情况虽然不十分具体，但也应该迅速地向节约检查委员会检举，或者提供节约检查委员会参考。这就是对国家人民利益积极负责的态度。即使检举的事实和调查结果有些出入，那也无关紧要。反之，有些店员知道一些贪污行贿的情况，但顾虑很多，不愿检举，这是觉悟不高、不关心国家与人民利益的具体表现。另外，有些店员怕检举后不顶事，怕报复，怕影响自己的职业等思想顾虑，也都是不必要的。他说：谁要在这个斗争中压制民主，起破坏作用，谁就要受到严厉处分。
    刘亚报告后，大家就按行业、地区分组讨论，并进行坦白、检举。在坦白、检举中，群众情绪极为高涨，一小时内就坦白和检举了贪污、行贿事件约三百多起。许多店员说：“这下算布好了天罗地网，贪污、行贿的不法分子，不坦白是不行的。”大家并一致表示：回去以后，一定发动广大店员一道进行检举，不让贪污、行贿分子漏掉一个。
    中国新民主主义青年团天津市第一区工作委员会一月六日晚也召开反贪污斗争大会，青年店员当场检举了行贿事件四百多件。    （本报综合）
