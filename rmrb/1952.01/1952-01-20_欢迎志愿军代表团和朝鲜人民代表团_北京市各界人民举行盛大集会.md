Guo Moruo said in his welcoming speech: "On behalf of all the Chinese people, I express my warm welcome and lofty respect to the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning to China and the delegation of the Korean People visiting China." After describing the great significance of the victories achieved by the Chinese and Korean People's forces over the past year, he said: "Dear comrades of the Volunteer Army delegation, you have come at a good time. Today, our motherland is carrying out a movement to increase production and practice economy. At the same time, we have opened a new front against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. You have moved from one front to another. You are a vital force on this new front. Please tell the people of the motherland about your model deeds of fighting the American aggressors in Korea and your selfless rescue and care for materials, so that we can jointly strive for greater victories on our new front against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy today. Dear comrades of the Korean People's Delegation visiting China, when you come to China, please also use your experience to help us launch the movement to increase production and practice economy and participate in our battle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Let us unite more closely and move from one victory to another even greater victory."

We welcome the representatives of our most beloved people and the representatives of our closest comrades-in-arms, the heroic Korean people." After describing the great significance of the friendship forged by the blood of the Chinese and Korean peoples, he said: "The first of the three central tasks adopted by the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held last October was to continue to strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea. This means that as long as U.S. imperialism does not give up its aggression against Korea, the great struggle of the Chinese people to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea will never cease. Facts have proved that the unity of the Chinese and Korean peoples will surely defeat our common enemy, U.S. imperialism."

Li Xuesan, head of the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning to China, said in his reply: "First of all, on behalf of Commander Peng Dehuai and all the comrades of the Volunteer Army, I thank the motherland and the people of Beijing for their great support to us, and I extend our highest respect." Then, he described the great achievements made by the Chinese and Korean People's forces fighting side by side over the past year. He also said: "The people of the motherland, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, have launched a vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy. This movement has given us great encouragement, and we have also enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call. In order to resolutely implement the task of increasing production and practicing economy, we guarantee to further develop the spirit of combat and the enthusiasm for work, and annihilate the enemy in large numbers; we guarantee to strengthen political study in order to improve our patriotic and internationalist ideological level; we guarantee to cherish all the materials given to us by the people of the motherland."

Hong Sun-chol, head of the Korean People's Delegation visiting China, said in his reply: "On behalf of all the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, I express my warm gratitude and highest respect to the brotherly Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party and its great leader Chairman Mao for their great material and spiritual assistance to the Korean people." He continued, "The mission of our delegation this time is to introduce the heroic and tenacious struggles of the Korean military and civilians and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to our Chinese brothers, so as to further strengthen the great friendship between the peoples of Korea and China. At the same time, we will learn from the Chinese people's experience in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing economy, and introduce it back to the Korean people, so that the Korean people's confidence in victory will be increased a hundredfold, and finally defeat our common enemy, the American aggressors."

Finally, Li Xuesan, head of the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning to China, read out Commander Peng Dehuai's letter of thanks to the people of the whole country from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. (Photo attached)
