Self-Criticism Regarding Wavering Standpoint in Handling the Paint Embezzlement Case
Wang Guangyuan, Director of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau
Wen Xiang, Deputy Director

    In the materials of our bureau's initial investigation report, we failed to differentiate between the illegal acts of private merchants bribing our staff and engaging in shoddy workmanship, and the erroneous act of the Hengyang Railway Bureau handling criminals who had defrauded state property without following legal procedures. We combined these two issues, blurring the nature of the case. At the same time, in the paint case, we lacked sufficient understanding of the illegal activities of private merchants and neglected and relaxed the struggle against illegal merchants. This was an act of protecting private merchants and losing our standpoint. Our second written report and Comrade Wen Xiang's speech at the meeting convened by the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee both insisted on and developed the aforementioned erroneous opinions. This was wrong. After the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee first raised its criticisms, we did not deeply examine the errors in our standpoint and views, but instead expressed dissatisfaction with the instructions of the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee. While studying this issue, our bureau leaked internal disagreements, providing excuses for illegal private merchants and affecting the swift and correct handling of the case. Strictly speaking, this was an act of divulging state secrets.

    The reasons for these erroneous actions are, on the one hand, that we viewed the problem purely from the perspective of market management, believing that the illegal activities of private merchants should be rectified, and that the lack of legal awareness on the part of the Hengyang Railway Bureau in handling this criminal case on its own should also be rectified. Therefore, we placed these two matters on an equal footing, treating the case of private merchants illegally seizing state property as a case of public-private dispute. On the other hand, we believed that although private manufacturers displayed serious speculation in this case, the Hengyang Railway Bureau was also at fault for not entrusting processing and ordering through the local industry and commerce administrative departments. In this incident, private merchants were the offenders, and the Hengyang Railway Bureau also bore responsibility. Starting from this erroneous understanding, we did not consider our attitude and standpoint towards this incident before (checking and preventing the occurrence of such incidents) and after (pursuing private merchants to compensate for the loss of state property), but confused general management issues with specific cases, actually playing a role in protecting illegal private merchants.

    These views, at first glance, appear to be a problem of ideological method, but are actually a problem of standpoint. Our complacency is the main reason for supporting erroneous actions. After the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee pointed out our errors, we still did not correct them, stubbornly clinging to our errors. The basic reason is complacency, unwillingness to accept criticism. In particular, we could not accept the words "wavering standpoint," and even felt "wronged." This shows how serious our unwillingness to examine ourselves and our complacency had become.

    The Industry and Commerce Bureau is the state's industry and commerce management organ. In handling this issue, due to errors in standpoint and views, we not only protected private merchants but also damaged the industrial and commercial policy. Therefore, we believe that our mistakes are serious and request the higher authorities to give us the deserved punishment.

    关于处理油漆舞弊案时立场不稳的检讨
    武汉市人民政府工商局局长  王光远
    副局长  文祥
    我局在第一次调查报告的材料中，没有把私商收买我工作人员、偷工减料的非法行为和衡阳铁路局没有按法定手续自行处理诈骗国家财产的罪犯的错误行为加以区别，把两个问题并在一起，混淆了案情的性质。同时，在油漆案中，我们对私商的非法行为认识不足，忽视和放松了对不法商人的斗争。这是一种袒护私商、丧失立场的行为。我们的第二个书面报告和文祥同志在中南人民监察委员会所召集的会议上的发言，都坚持并发展了上述错误意见。这是错误的。在中南人民监察委员会第一次提出批评后，我们又没有深刻地检查自己的立场和观点的错误，反而对于中南人民监察委员会的指示表示不满。而在研究这一问题时，我局把内部没有统一的意见泄露了出去，给不法私商以藉口，影响了案件的迅速、正确处理。严格地讲，这是泄露国家机密的行为。
    产生这些错误行为的原因，一方面是我们单纯地从市场管理的观点来看问题，认为私商的不法行为要整，衡阳铁路局缺乏法治观念自行处理这一案犯的问题也要整，因而把这两件事平列起来，把私商非法窃取国家财产的案件，认为是公私纠纷案。另一方面是我们认为私营厂商在这一案件中虽表现了严重的投机性，但是衡阳铁路局不通过地方工商行政部门进行委托加工和定货，也有不对的地方。在这一事件中，私商是犯罪者，衡阳铁路局也负有责任。从这种错误认识出发，所以没有考虑到我们在事前（应检查和防止这类事件的发生）、事后（应追究私商赔偿国家财产损失）对这一事件的态度和立场，而把一般的管理问题和具体的案件混为一谈，实际上是起了袒护不法私商的作用。
    以上这些观点，看来是思想方法问题，实际上是立场问题。我们的骄傲自满情绪是支持错误行为的主要原因。中南人民监察委员会指出我们的错误以后我们还不改正，一味坚持错误，基本原因就是骄傲自满，不愿意接受批评。特别是对“立场不稳”四字，更听不进耳去，还觉得是受了“冤枉”。这说明我们不虚心检查自己、骄傲自满的情绪到了多么严重的程度。
    工商局是国家的工商管理机关。我们在处理这个问题中，由于立场和观点的错误，不仅袒护了私商，而且损害了工商业政策。因此，我们认为我们的错误是严重的，请求上级给以应得的处分。
