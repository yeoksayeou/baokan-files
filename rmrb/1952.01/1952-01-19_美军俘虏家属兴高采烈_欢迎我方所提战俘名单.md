Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Despite Truman and the US Department of Defense slandering the list of American prisoners of war proposed by the Korean and Chinese sides and demanding that the American people "treat this list with suspicion," the American people welcomed the list with boundless joy.

In New York City, reactionary newspapers such as the "New York Daily News" and the "Daily Mirror" used many pages to publish photos of the joyous scenes of prisoners of war's families receiving news of their loved ones.

The New York "Daily Mirror" published a large photo on the first half-page of its December 20, 1951, issue. The photo showed the wife of Lieutenant Joseph A. Magnant, who lived at 330 Wadsworth Avenue in New York City, and her four-year-old daughter, who was asleep and tightly hugging a photo of her prisoner father. Magnant's wife said, "The only way to make this Christmas better is to send the soldiers home."

Another photo was about the joyous family of Private First Class George G. Davidson. The caption of the photo was: "This family from Staten Island is extremely happy..."

Mrs. Norman Cotton of 165 India Street, Brooklyn, shed tears of joy when she heard the good news that her son, Corporal John Cotton, was safe.

Mr. and Mrs. Brown of 157 East 26th Street in New York City stayed by the radio all night after hearing that their son, Corporal Harold Brown, was a prisoner.

    美军俘虏家属兴高采烈
    欢迎我方所提战俘名单
    【新华社十八日讯】尽管杜鲁门和美国国防部对于朝中方面所提出的美国战俘名单横加诬蔑，要求美国人民“以怀疑的态度来对待这项名单”，但是美国人民却以无限的喜悦来欢迎这个名单。
    在纽约市，反动报纸如“纽约每日新闻”和“每日镜报”曾用许多页的篇幅登出战俘们的家属在接到他们的亲人的消息时兴高采烈的情形的照片。
    纽约“每日镜报”在一九五一年十二月二十日用第一页半页的篇幅登载了大幅照片，照片的内容是住在纽约市华兹沃斯大道三百三十号的约瑟夫·爱·马格南特中尉的妻子和她的四岁的女孩，这女孩睡着了，还紧紧地抱住她的战俘爸爸的照片。马格南特的妻子说：“要使这次圣诞节过得好些，只有把兵士送回家。”
    另一幅是关于一等兵乔治·季·德维得逊的欢天喜地的家属的照片。该照片的说明是：“这一个斯退顿岛的一家人真是快乐极了。……”
    布鲁克林印度街一百六十五号的诺曼·考顿太太听到她的儿子约翰·考顿下士平安的好消息时，高兴得掉下泪来。
    纽约市东二十六号街一百五十七号的布朗夫妇听说他们的儿子哈罗德·布朗下士是俘虏的消息后，曾在收音机旁边守了一整夜。
