Literary Publications Should Strengthen Ideological Content

Comrades Editors: I saw in the "People's Daily" the decision of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles on adjusting Beijing's literary and art publications, and I also saw Comrade Ding Ling's article "Struggling to Strengthen the Ideological and Combat Effectiveness of Our Publications." I feel that it is very necessary to adjust these national literary and art publications, strengthen their ideological content, and make them truly powerful weapons for guiding the national literary and art movement and educating the masses.

These publications have done some work in the past and have achieved some results, more or less; but these achievements are still far from meeting the needs of the people; even in some publications, works with serious errors often appear. The editorial policies of some publications are unclear, and there are still considerable problems in their editorial ideology and style; however, the editorial departments of these publications have not paid enough attention to their mistakes, and have not yet carried out criticism and self-criticism well to check and improve their work at any time.

For example, the organ of the All-China Federation of Literary Workers, "People's Literature," due to its unclear editorial policy and biases in its editorial ideology, its content is not substantial. It has failed to take responsibility for guiding national literary creation, and frequently publishes works with erroneous content, such as Xiao Ye Mu's "Between Husband and Wife," Qin Zhaoyang's "Transformation," Bai Ren's "Bloody Battle of Tianmen Peak," and Ding Kexin's "Old Worker Guo Fushan." In "People's Literature," we cannot often see guiding articles on current literary creation issues. "People's Literature" has not launched any discussions on some major issues in literary creation (mainly in literary thought) (such as Xiao Ye Mu's creative tendencies, etc.). It seems that the task of the editorial department of this publication is only to collect a few works, typeset and print them, and many major issues in literary work can be ignored and unstudied. However, from some erroneous works published in "People's Literature," a common tendency can be seen, that is, to distort the true face of the people's mass struggle with petty-bourgeois ideas and feelings. These works do not promote the advanced ideas of the proletariat; on the contrary, they promote the vulgar tastes and erroneous ideas of the petty bourgeoisie. The editorial department of "People's Literature" has not only failed to detect the errors in these works in advance, but even after the literary and art circles and readers have made serious criticisms of these works, they still do not pay attention to the ideological essence of these errors and the problems existing in the editorial work. The editorial department of this publication has never made a more serious public review of the biases in its work. All this can illustrate that the editorial department of "People's Literature" lacks a sense of responsibility to the people, otherwise, why could they have long ignored the harm of petty-bourgeois ideas to the people's literary and art cause, and not face up to their own shortcomings and errors?

"Talk and Sing" is a publication that publishes popular literary and art works, and this kind of publication is very necessary. However, the editorial department of this publication also does not pay enough attention to the ideological content of the publication. It once published the novel "Golden Lock" with very bad content, which distorted the peasants to an intolerable degree. Later, Comrade Zhao Shuli, one of the persons in charge of this publication, made some reviews, but they were not profound enough. And since then, "Talk and Sing" has not made significant improvements in the ideological nature of the publication. Not long ago, it still published works such as "Planting Cotton," which promoted capitalist ideas. The introductory text published by "Talk and Sing" on the discussion of the Wu Xun issue used a bystander's tone and made some inappropriate remarks. It can be seen that in the editorial work of "Talk and Sing," ideological work has never been put first, but rather ignored, and even far behind the actual situation of the masses' ideological struggle. May I ask, if such a publication is not improved, can it assume the responsibility of ideological education for the people?

From the first and second volumes of "People's Drama," it can be seen that this publication also has no editorial policy. Its content is very poor, and even some articles have erroneous viewpoints. It has neither raised the important issues in current drama creation and the drama movement, nor published any works with ideological content. Although it has made some improvements since then, it is still not commensurate with the responsibility it bears for guiding the national drama work. Even in the articles it published, it encouraged petty-bourgeois creative tendencies. For example, Comrade Guang Weiran's article "Introducing Several Patriotic One-Act Plays" made inappropriate praises for formalism and creations that promoted petty-bourgeois ideas.

The above is just some of the problems I have seen. If these problems are not thoroughly resolved, our literary and art publications will not be able to well implement Chairman Mao's literary and art thought and assume the increasingly important task of ideological education for the people.
Reader Zhang Lei

"People's Literature" Editorial Department Should Examine the Petty-Bourgeois Tendency in Editorial Thinking

Comrade Editor: I read in the newspaper Ding Ling's speech at the mobilization meeting for rectification and study in Beijing's literary and art circles. She said: Our literary and art publications often publish some dispensable articles, and even publish harmful works. She also said: Criticism and self-criticism in several literary and art publications cannot be carried out. I think "People's Literature," this national literary and art publication, has this problem, and it is very serious. Since its inception, "People's Literature" has published some good works, but it has also published many works with erroneous ideas, such as Xiao Ye Mu's "Between Husband and Wife," Ding Kexin's "Old Worker Guo Fushan," Fang Ji's "Let Life Be Better," Bai Ren's "Bloody Battle of Tianmen Peak," Zuo Youmin's "The Story of Smoke," and Zhu Ding's "Company Commander Guan," etc. These works with strong petty-bourgeois thoughts and feelings appeared one after another in "People's Literature," which shows that there is a serious petty-bourgeois ideological tendency in the editorial thinking of "People's Literature." When Xiao Ye Mu's bad creative tendency was severely criticized in "People's Daily" and "Literary Gazette," many young readers who had been influenced by Xiao Ye Mu's works woke up and began to realize the necessity of ideological reform; publications that had published Xiao Ye Mu's works, such as "China Youth" magazine, also published articles criticizing Xiao Ye Mu's creations and published Xiao Ye Mu's self-criticism, and the publications themselves also made self-criticism. However, Xiao Ye Mu's "Between Husband and Wife" was published in "People's Literature." If the "People's Literature" editorial department regards the people's literature and art cause as a fighting weapon to educate the people and encourage the people to move forward, then it should take responsibility for the vast number of readers and consciously conduct self-criticism. It should never take an attitude of indifference. Since Chen Yong criticized Xiao Ye Mu's creative tendency in the "People's Daily," it has been five or six months, but "People's Literature" has never published articles on this subject, not even reprinted Xiao Ye Mu's self-criticism, let alone any self-criticism. This shows that the "People's Literature" editorial department's irresponsible attitude towards readers and lack of self-criticism has reached a serious point.

In addition, after "People's Literature" published Ding Kexin's short story "Old Worker Guo Fushan," a reader made criticisms in Shanghai's "Liberation Daily." When the editors of "People's Literature" reprinted the reader's criticism, they added an editor's note, explaining that they published this work because "there are not many works describing the heroic deeds and heroic images of the working class," and they published it for "the need in this area." However, "it was a negligence not to add an appropriate editor's note at the time of publication." What does this want to explain? If the editorial department saw that this work had "relatively serious shortcomings" before publishing it, why send the work with "relatively serious shortcomings" to the readers as "nourishment"? The editorial department should not forget that "writers are the engineers of human souls"! Is it the essence of the problem to lightly blame themselves for "negligence" afterwards?

"People's Literature" is the organ of the All-China Federation of Literary Workers, and it has a large number of readers across the country. Readers have great hopes and trust in it. I often hear readers say: "The works published in 'People's Literature' will not have any major problems." I am also a reader who trusts "People's Literature." Of course, it is not good to blindly worship a publication without using your brain to think independently, but it reflects how much trust readers have in the "People's Literature" publication. This trust should urge the "People's Literature" editorial department to choose the works they publish more carefully, more seriously, and more responsibly. The people cannot allow the editorial department to have any "negligence."

Of course, writers should be responsible for bad works, but the editorial department is also largely responsible for publishing bad works in publications. I am only making suggestions to the editorial department of one publication here, so I will not talk about the issues of writers.

During the rectification and study period in Beijing's literary and art circles, I hope that the "People's Literature" editorial department can earnestly conduct an examination and make a satisfactory review in order to better improve the editorial work and make our people's literature and art, as Comrade Hu Qiaomu pointed out, should fully promote Marxist literary and art thought, so that literature and art become the fighting weapon of the working class.
Reader Wei Fangai

Editor's note: The opinions put forward by readers Zhang Lei and Wei Fangai on literary and art publications are basically correct. The editorial departments of various literary and art publications should seriously and earnestly examine their own publications and editorial thinking in this rectification and study in order to improve their work and meet the requirements of readers.

I Have Initially Recognized the Errors of My Purely Technical Viewpoint

In this ideological remolding study, I first criticized my purely technical viewpoint. When I was studying in the Department of Earth Sciences at Beijing Normal University, I almost had to burn the midnight oil every day, burying myself in books and lectures. The library almost became my home. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, the struggle between progressive forces and reactionary forces was extremely sharp, but I stood outside the struggle. I thought of myself as a "studious person" and subjectively believed that the school was an academic research institution and should not have political struggles.

In 1946, I transferred to the Department of Earth Sciences at Tsinghua University. At this time, in the vigorous student movement against hunger and civil war across the country, I agreed with the strike, but I did not go to the parade. Why? During the strike, I could read more books. When the marching team set off, the song "Unity is Strength" shook Tsinghua Garden, but I hid in the dormitory and took an indifferent attitude towards the fate of the people and the country.

In 1948, I graduated from university. I quickly joined the work of the North China Meteorological Observatory. I was very happy, thinking that I had obtained the price of studying hard and had the opportunity to specialize in academic and technical research. After liberation, a comrade patiently educated me, pointed out the path that a young person should take, and introduced me to study. After eight months of study, I initially gained basic knowledge about the Chinese revolution. But when I criticized my own thinking, I still thought that before liberation, the work of the meteorological observatory was "noble" scientific and technological work. Later, with the help and enlightenment of party member comrades, I suddenly realized. It turned out that my work at the meteorological observatory was actually serving the reactionary rulers. At that time, the War of Liberation was in full swing, and the people were fighting against the Chiang Kai-shek gang. The meteorological observatory sent the weather forecast to Chennault's air force brigade every day, so that Chennault's bombers could bomb the liberated areas. Although I myself was not a direct murderer, my work undoubtedly helped the reactionary rulers. My self-proclaimed nobility and self-belief that I had nothing to do with politics were obviously inconsistent with the facts.

Now, in my work, there are still remnants of purely technical viewpoints. I am very keen on business learning and often find some business-related newspapers, magazines, and books to read; when I can't see them or don't have time to see them, I feel uneasy. And my political learning is very poor; I only passively complete the tasks given by the administration. This has hindered my progress. I must thoroughly liquidate my erroneous thoughts through this study, strive to transform myself, and be a glorious people's teacher.
Teacher of the Affiliated Girls' High School of Normal University Li Defeng

I Want to Stand Firm and Establish the Spirit of Serving the People

When I was studying in middle school, I mistakenly believed that "the way to save the country" lies in education, "politics is dirty," and "noble people should never participate in political activities." From 1936 to 1937, the student movement was developing vigorously across the country. At that time, I was the director of training at Beijing Jinde Middle School. I always advised students to study hard and not to participate in any political activities. If students did not listen, I would stop them. The main reason why I dissuaded students from participating in the student movement was: I believed that "only studying can save the country" and "student strikes can never save the country." At the time, I thought this approach was very correct and "responsible for young people." Now it seems that this is actually helping the reactionary ruling class and harming the revolution.

I now realize that although I was not a reactionary element at the time, because I was a teacher who was very popular with students in the past, my influence on students was very bad.

After liberation, after studying, I had a correct understanding of the Communist Party. I wanted to make progress and reform, but because I did not liquidate my erroneous thoughts well, I could not stand firmly on the side of the people. For example, I once had fear of the United States, thinking that "China is not good, and cannot resist American imperialism." But the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea was victorious, and the construction of the motherland is also advancing by leaps and bounds. These facts have deeply educated me, so that I began to realize the greatness of the motherland and the correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party. Of course, this is not to say that my many erroneous thoughts have been completely overcome, no. For example, in teaching work, I only value business learning and despise political learning. When choosing teaching materials, I often start from my own interests and do not consider the needs and acceptance of students. My desire to climb up is quite strong, and I always think of teaching in a university. This year I have consulted with Shanxi University and Lanzhou University, but I did not go because the conditions were not met. This shows that I still have thoughts of fame and gain. Because I am not at ease with my work, so my work is not solid, causing the students' learning to suffer losses.

In short, I still have many problems in my thinking, thinking more for myself and less for the people. Now, I understand what is called the people's stand and how to establish the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people in practice. This initial understanding is a very important gain for me. In the future, I will thoroughly transform my thinking through study and be a people's teacher!

Welcome Industrial and Commercial Circles to Carry Out Ideological Remolding

Comrade Editor: I think it is very necessary for the industrial and commercial circles to launch an ideological remolding movement.

We all know that for more than two years since the liberation of the mainland, industrialists and businessmen from all over the country, together with the people of the whole country, have made significant progress under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. The ideological consciousness of many industrialists and businessmen has been improved. They have reformed their institutions and improved their business policies, and this is all right. Especially in the patriotic movements such as resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production and donating money, they have collectively paid taxes, enthusiastically donated money, and widely established patriotic conventions, which are concrete manifestations of loving the motherland. But the above does not mean that there are no shortcomings in the industrial and commercial circles now. The idea of ​​some industrialists and businessmen to seek huge profits is still very serious; in this anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign, many bribery behaviors of industrialists and businessmen have been exposed in various places. Some still retain strong feudal habits and arbitrarily persecute employees; some are indifferent to the current national political struggle tasks, and even take a position of no position and indifference to the enemy. These thoughts or actions violate the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and are also detrimental to the industrial and commercial circles themselves. Therefore, launching an ideological remolding movement in the industrial and commercial circles not only meets the hopes of the people of the whole country, but also meets the hopes of all patriotic industrial and commercial circles.

At present, this movement has first started in Beijing and Tianjin. We warmly welcome Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou and other parts of the country to participate quickly, so as to transform themselves and help the construction of new democracy.

I am an educator, and many of my family and relatives are engaged in industry and commerce. I am willing to assist and promote them to participate in this movement. Let the people of the whole country unite more closely under the leadership of the victorious Mao Zedong Thought and strive to defend and build our great motherland.

### 努力改造思想，为祖国建设服务

专栏：

    努力改造思想，为祖国建设服务
    文艺刊物应当加强思想性
    编辑同志：在“人民日报”上看到了全国文联关于调整北京文艺刊物的决定，又看到了丁玲同志的
    “为加强我们刊物的思想性、战斗性而斗争”的文章。我觉得，调整这些全国性的文艺刊物，加强它们的思想内容，使它们真正成为指导全国文艺运动和教育群众的有力武器，是十分必要的。
    这些刊物在过去做了一些工作，而且或多或少地有了一些成绩；但这些成绩和人民的需要比起来，距离还是很远的；甚至在一些刊物上，还经常出现一些有严重错误的作品。某些刊物的编辑方针是不明确的，在编辑思想和编辑作风上，还存在着相当严重的问题；而这些刊物的编辑部，对自己的错误却没有足够的重视，还没有很好地展开批评与自我批评，随时检查和改进自己的工作。
    譬如说，中华全国文学工作者协会的机关刊物“人民文学”，由于它的编辑方针不明确和编辑思想上有偏向，所以，它的内容是不充实的，它没有能负起指导全国文学创作的责任，而且经常发表内容错误的作品，如萧也牧的“我们夫妇之间”，秦兆阳的“改造”，白刃的“血战天门顶”，丁克辛的“老工人郭福山”等。在“人民文学”上，我们不能经常看到关于当前文学创作问题的有指导意义的文章。“人民文学”对文学创作中（主要是文学思想中）的一些重大问题（如萧也牧的创作倾向等），也没有展开过什么讨论。彷佛这个刊物的编辑部的任务只是凑几篇作品，付排刊印，而对于文学工作中的许多重大问题，可以不加注意和研究。但是，从“人民文学”发表的一些有错误的作品中，可以看到一种共同的倾向，那就是以小资产阶级的思想感情，来歪曲人民群众的生活斗争的真实面貌。这些作品不是宣传无产阶级的先进思想，相反地，是宣扬小资产阶级的庸俗趣味和错误的思想。“人民文学”编辑部不但没有能够在事前察觉这些作品中的错误，甚至在文艺界和读者对这些作品进行了严正的批评以后，还不去注意这些错误的思想实质和编辑工作中所存在的问题。对于自己工作中的偏向，这个刊物的编辑部也从来没有作过比较认真的公开的检讨。这些，都可以说明“人民文学”的编辑部是缺乏对人民负责的精神的，否则，他们为什么居然可以长期地忽视小资产阶级思想对人民文学事业的危害，也不正视自己的缺点和错误呢？
    “说说唱唱”是一个发表通俗文艺作品的刊物，这种刊物是很需要的。但是，这个刊物的编辑部，对刊物的思想内容的重视也很不够。它曾发表过内容十分恶劣的小说“金锁”，这个作品把农民歪曲到不能容忍的地步。后来这个刊物的负责人之一赵树理同志虽作了一些检讨，但很不深刻。而在以后，
    “说说唱唱”在刊物的思想性上也没有显著的改进。不久前仍旧发表了像“种棉记”之类的宣传资本主义思想的作品。“说说唱唱”所发表的关于武训问题的讨论的介绍文字，竟用一种旁观的口吻，发了一些不恰当的议论。由此可见，在“说说唱唱”的编辑工作中，一直没有把思想工作放在首位，而是不加重视，甚至远远地落在群众的思想斗争的实际之后。试问，这样的刊物，如果不加以改进，能不能担负起对于人民的思想教育的责任呢？
    从“人民戏剧”的前一、二卷中，可以看到这个刊物也没有什么编辑方针。它的内容是非常贫乏的，甚至有些文章的观点是有错误的。它既没有提出当前戏剧创作和戏剧运动中的重要问题，也没有发表什么有思想内容的作品。虽然它在以后有了一些改进，但对于它所负的指导全国戏剧工作的责任，依然是不相称的。甚至在它所发表的文章中，鼓励了小资产阶级的创作倾向，如光未然同志的“介绍几个爱国主义的独幕剧”一文，就对宣扬小资产阶级思想的、形式主义的创作，作了不适当的歌颂。
    上面所说的，只是我所看到的一些问题。这些问题如果不彻底解决，我们的文艺刊物就无法很好地贯彻毛主席的文艺思想，负起日益重要的对人民的思想教育的任务。    读者  张雷
    “人民文学”编辑部应该检查编辑思想中的小资产阶级倾向
    编辑同志：我在报纸上看到丁玲在北京文艺界整风学习动员大会上的讲话，她说：我们的文艺刊物上常常发表一些可有可无的文章，甚至发表了有害的作品。又说：若干文艺刊物批评与自我批评展不开。我认为“人民文学”这个全国性的文艺刊物，就有这种毛病，而且很严重。“人民文学”自创刊以来，发表了一些较好的作品，但也发表了许多有错误思想的作品，如萧也牧的“我们夫妇之间”，丁克辛的“老工人郭福山”，方纪的“让生活过得更美好罢”，白刃的“血战天门顶”，左佑民的“烟的故事”，朱定的“关连长”等。这些带着浓厚的小资产阶级的思想感情的作品，接二连三地在“人民文学”上出现，这说明“人民文学”的编辑思想上有着严重的小资产阶级的思想倾向。当萧也牧的不良的创作倾向在“人民日报”“文艺报”上被严正地批评后，不少曾受过萧也牧的作品影响的青年读者，猛醒过来，开始认识到思想改造的必要；曾刊载过萧也牧作品的刊物，如“中国青年”杂志，也先后发表了批评萧也牧创作的文章，刊载了萧也牧的自我检讨，刊物本身也作了自我检讨。但萧也牧创作的“我们夫妇之间”，是在“人民文学”上发表的。假若“人民文学”编辑部把人民的文学艺术事业当作教育人民，鼓舞人民前进的战斗的武器的话，那么，它就应该对广大读者负起责任，自觉地进行自我批评。决不应该采取置之不理的态度。自从陈涌在“人民日报”上批评萧也牧的创作倾向后，至今已有五六个月了，但“人民文学”从未发表过这方面的文章，甚至连萧也牧的自我检讨，也不加转载，更没有自我批评的表示。这说明“人民文学”编辑部对读者的不负责任，缺乏自我批评精神的错误态度，已经到了严重的地步。
    另外，“人民文学”发表了丁克辛的短篇小说“老工人郭福山”后，即有读者在上海“解放日报”上提出批评，“人民文学”的编者转载这位读者的批评文章时，却加上按语，说明他们发表这篇作品，是由于“描写工人阶级的英勇事迹和英雄形象的作品还不多”，为了“这方面的需要”才发表了它。不过，“在发表时未加适当的按语，实在是一个疏忽。”这是想说明什么问题呢？假若说编辑部在发表这篇作品前，已看出了这篇作品有“比较严重的缺点”，为什麽竟将有“比较严重缺点”的作品送给读者当“滋养品”呢？编辑部不要忘记，“文学家是人类灵魂的工程师”啊！仅仅在事后这样轻轻地责备一下自己“疏忽”，这难道是问题的本质吗？
    “人民文学”是中华全国文学工作者协会的机关刊物，在全国有广大的读者，读者对它寄予很大的希望和信赖，我常常听到读者说：“这是‘人民文学’上发表的作品，不会有什么大问题。”我也是信赖“人民文学”的一个读者。当然，这种不用脑子去独立思考，盲目崇拜一个刊物是不好的，但却反映了读者对“人民文学”这个刊物有着多么大的信任。这种信任，应该督促“人民文学”编辑部更慎重、更严肃、更负责地去选择他们刊登的作品，人民群众是不能允许编辑部有任何“疏忽”的。
    当然，不好的作品，作家是应该负责任的，然而在刊物上发表了不好的作品，编辑部也是有很大责任的。我这里只对一个刊物的编辑部提意见，所以，不去谈作家的问题。
    在北京文艺界整风学习期间，我希望“人民文学”编辑部能够切实地进行检查，作出令人满意的检讨，以期更好地改进编辑工作，使我们的人民文艺像胡乔木同志所指出的一样：应该充分宣传马克思主义的文艺思想，使文艺成为工人阶级的战斗的武器。读者    魏方艾
    编者按：读者张雷和魏方艾对文艺刊物所提的意见，基本上是正确的。各文艺刊物编辑部在此次整风学习中应该严肃认真地检查自己的刊物和编辑思想，以改进工作，满足读者要求。
    我初步认识了自己单纯技术观点的错误
    在这次思想改造学习中，我首先批判了我的单纯技术观点。我在北京师范大学地学系学习时，几乎每天都要开夜车，把自己埋在书本和讲义中。图书馆几乎变成了我的家。一九四五年抗日战争胜利以后，进步力量和反动势力的斗争极为尖锐，我却站在斗争之外。我自以为是“好学之士”，主观地认为学校是学术研究机关，不应该有政治斗争。
    一九四六年，我转学到清华大学地学系。这时，在全国轰轰烈烈的反饥饿反内战的学生运动中，我是赞同罢课的，但是我却不去游行。为什么呢？在罢课期间，我可以多看一些书。当游行队伍出发时，“团结就是力量”的歌声震撼了清华园，而我却躲在寝室里，对人民和国家的命运采取漠不关心的态度。
    一九四八年，我在大学毕业了。很快就参加了华北气象台的工作。我非常高兴，认为已经取得了努力读书的代价，并且得到了专门研究学术和技术的机会。解放后，有一个同志耐心地教育我，向我指出一个青年应走的道路，并介绍我参加学习。经过八个月的学习，我初步获得了关于中国革命问题的基本知识。但我在批判自己的思想时，还一直认为在解放前，气象台的工作是“清高的”科学技术工作。后来经过党员同志的帮助和启发，我才恍然大悟。原来我在气象台的工作，实际上是在替反动统治者服务。当时，解放战争正在激烈地进行着，人民正在和蒋介石匪帮搏斗。气象台每天把天气预报发给陈纳德的航空大队，好让陈纳德的轰炸机轰炸解放区。我自己虽然不是一个直接杀人的凶手，但我的工作无疑地是帮助了反动统治者。我的自鸣清高和自以为同政治无关，显然是不合事实的。
    现在，我在工作中，还是残存着单纯的技术观点。我对业务学习抓得很紧，经常找些业务方面的报纸、杂志、书籍来阅读；看不到或者没有时间看的时候，我心里就不安。而我的政治学习很差；我只是被动地去完成行政方面所给的任务。这样就使我的进步受到了阻碍。我一定要通过这次学习，彻底清算我的错误思想，努力改造自己，做一个光荣的人民教师。    师大女附中教员  李德风
    我要站稳立场，树立为人民服务的精神
    我在中学求学时就错误地认为“救国的方法”在于教育，“政治是污秽的”，“清高的人决不应该参加政治活动”。一九三六年到一九三七年，学生运动在全国轰轰烈烈地发展着。那时候，我在北京进德中学当训育主任。我总是劝告学生安心读书，不要参加任何政治活动。如果学生不听，就加以阻止。我劝阻学生参加学生运动的主要原因是：我认为“只有读书才能救国”，“搞学潮决不能救国”。当时我认为这种作法是非常正确的，是“对青年负责”的。现在看来，这实际上是给反动统治阶级帮忙，损害革命。
    我现在认识到，我当时虽然不是反动分子，但是由于我过去曾是一个很受学生欢迎的教师，我给同学的影响是很坏的。
    解放后，经过学习，我对共产党有了正确的认识。要求进步，要求改造，但是，由于我没有很好地清算自己的错误思想，所以还不能站稳人民的立场。例如，我曾有恐美思想，认为“中国不行，抗不了美帝国主义”。但是抗美援朝胜利了，祖国的各项建设事业也在突飞猛进，这些事实深深地教育了我，使我开始认识到祖国的伟大，认识到共产党领导的正确。当然，这不是说我的许多错误思想已经完全克服，不是的。比方在教学工作上，我只重视业务学习，轻视政治学习。选教材时，常从自己的兴趣出发，没有很好地考虑学生的需要和接受能力。我往上爬的思想是相当浓厚的，总想到大学里去教书。今年我曾和山西大学、兰州大学商洽过，因为条件不合才没有去。这说明我还有着名利思想。因为我不安心工作，所以工作不踏实，使同学们的学习受到损失。
    总之，我在思想上还有着很多的毛病，为自己打算的多，为人民打算的少。现在，我明白了什么叫做人民立场，怎样在实践中树立起全心全意为人民服务的精神。这个初步的认识，对我说是一个很重要的收获。今后我要通过学习，彻底改造自己的思想，做一个人民教师！
                        师大女附中教员  赵德先
    欢迎工商界进行思想改造
    编辑同志：我认为工商界开展思想改造运动，是十分必要的。
    我们都知道，全国大陆解放两年多来，各地工商业家和全国人民一道，在中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，已有了显著的进步。许多工商业家的思想觉悟提高了。他们改革了机构、改善了经营方针，这都是对的。特别是在抗美援朝、增产捐献等爱国主义运动中，他们集体纳税、踊跃捐献、广泛订立爱国公约，更是热爱祖国的具体表现。但以上这些，并不能说明现在工商界已经没有缺点了。某些工商业者贪图暴利的思想仍很严重；在这次反贪污、反浪费的运动中，各地都揭发了许多工商业者的行贿行为。有的还保留着浓厚的封建习气，任意迫害职工；有的对当前国家政治斗争任务漠不关心，甚至采取毫无立场、敌我不分的态度。这些思想或行动，都违反了人民政协共同纲领，对工商界自己也是不利的。所以，工商界开展思想改造运动，不只是符合全国人民的希望，也是符合全体爱国工商界的希望的。
    目前，这个运动已在北京、天津首先展开，我们热烈欢迎上海、汉口、广州及全国其他各地工商界都能迅速参加，以便改造自己，并有助于新民主主义的建设事业。
    我是一个教育工作者，我的家庭和亲戚朋友中，有很多是从事工商业的，我愿意协助和推动他们参加这一运动。让全国人民在胜利的毛泽东思想的领导下，更紧密地团结起来，为保卫和建设我们伟大的祖国而奋斗。    鲍世平
