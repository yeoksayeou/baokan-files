We all remember that the issue of so-called "collective measures" was already discussed at the Fifth UN General Assembly the year before last, and as a result, a resolution was adopted under the false title of "United Action for Peace." This resolution was touted as a program for consolidating peace. Throughout the resolution, there was deceptive talk about eliminating the threat of war and resisting the crisis of aggression with united action to safeguard peace. In reality, this resolution was not a program for consolidating peace but a program for preparing for a new war, and its purpose was to create all the necessary conditions for launching and achieving such a war.

The emergence of this resolution was undoubtedly related to the US aggression against North Korea, which, on the one hand, showed that the adventurous policy of the US monopoly capitalists who launched the war had no hope of success, and on the other hand, showed that they could not cope with the situation in the war without dragging other countries that were economically and politically dependent on the United States into this military adventure.

US Secretary of State Mr. Acheson's New Year's Eve speech in New York and the speeches of some of the drafters of the aforementioned proposal yesterday confirmed the relationship between the US aggression against North Korea, the "United Action for Peace" resolution of the year before last, and the emergence of the so-called "collective measures" proposal. The drafters of the aforementioned proposal said directly yesterday that the Korean incident was the condition for the emergence of "United Action for Peace" and the current so-called "collective measures" proposal.

Participating in the Korean War were not the United Nations but vassal states of the US aggressors

In the "Collective Measures Committee's" report on the so-called "collective measures," there is a special appendix, No. 4, specifically discussing the course of the Korean issue, which is not accidental. From this document, it can be seen that the Korean incident indeed prompted some countries that abused the name of international organizations and took actions supposedly to resist aggression to be drawn into joint military action measures.

In order to portray the US armed intervention in North Korea as widespread – if not universal – assistance to the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, the report made it seem as if forty-seven UN member states and two non-member states had decided to participate in the so-called "assistance," and many other countries had decided to provide land forces for this cause.

The report stated that the governments of twenty-five countries had offered armed forces to support military operations in Korea, twenty countries had provided ground forces for the same purpose, eight countries had provided naval forces, and four countries had provided air forces. The report did not conceal the use of Japanese bases, which, as the report stated, was extremely important.

However, it should be pointed out that what is discussed in this section of the report, as well as what is incidentally mentioned in the entire report regarding this aspect, does not correspond to the truth of the matter at all. In reality, as can be seen from the Second Supplementary Document, besides the United States, the United Kingdom, and the British Commonwealth, the only countries participating in the Korean War were Belgium, France, Colombia, Denmark (which sent the hospital ship "Jutlandia" to Korea, which, according to reliable sources, has been recalled), Greece, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and Turkey – eight countries in total. This is the so-called entire United Nations organization participating in the war against the Korean people. Eight countries: Denmark, which only sent a hospital ship and did not continue its involvement; Turkey, which sent a brigade; the Philippines, Greece, the Netherlands, Colombia, Belgium, and France. That's the whole picture. Can it be said that the United Nations participated in this war? Can it be said that forty-seven UN member states participated? This is absolutely not in line with the actual situation. The sole purpose of saying this is to portray the US aggression against Korea (in which some member states of the Atlantic aggressive bloc participated) as if the entire United Nations participated, as the report states, and to cover up this US aggression in the name of the United Nations.

Everyone also knows that only thirty-eight governments responded to the questions raised by the Secretariat's representatives in the so-called "Collective Measures" Committee to all UN member states regarding what measures they had taken in accordance with Resolution 377, "United Action for Peace"; and their responses proved that it was very difficult for the United States to piece together its "collective measures" system. In fact, the governments of twenty-two countries did not respond to the Secretary-General's questions at all, and of the remaining thirty-eight governments that did respond – including the so-called Kuomintang "government" – only eighteen governments agreed to allocate a certain number of armed forces to participate in collective measures; nine governments (Guatemala, India, Pakistan, Honduras, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Liberia, Burma, Venezuela) refused to participate in collective measures for various reasons; the responses of seven governments (Haiti, Chile, Sweden, Egypt, Israel, Ecuador, Yugoslavia) were evasive, amounting to a refusal to participate; and the responses of four governments (Bolivia, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Mexico) merely stated that they had received the questions from the UN Secretariat's representatives.

Thus, out of sixty UN member states, the governments of twenty-two countries did not respond to the Secretariat's questions regarding the extent and form of their willingness to participate in collective measures, particularly in the Korean War; the governments of eighteen other countries expressed their agreement to contribute some armed forces to participate in collective measures; the governments of nine countries refused to participate for various reasons; the responses of the governments of seven countries were evasive, amounting to a refusal to participate; and the governments of four countries merely replied that they had received the questions.

Later, those who spoke here went on to tell us that the United Nations participated in the Korean War. No, gentlemen, let us say, fortunately for the United Nations and the honor of the United Nations, it was not the United Nations that participated in the Korean War, but only the vassal states of the United States, only the client states that are economically and financially dependent on the United States.

It should also be pointed out that some governments that gave affirmative replies did so only in a formal way. For example, the Brazilian government merely made a promise to place its armed forces under the command of the United Nations as far as possible; the Australian government argued that it was already participating in military operations in Korea and Malaya; and the New Zealand government said that its current obligations in Korea and the needs of its regional defense did not allow it to provide more troops at present.

All of this is sufficient to show the true attitude of the vast majority of UN member states towards using their own armed forces to participate in the US intervention in North Korea and to participate in collective measures in general. At the same time, all of this fully refutes the absolutely unfounded arbitrary assertions contained in the report of the so-called "Collective Measures" Committee, which stated that the question raised by the Secretariat received a broad, practically universal response from UN member states.

The U.S.'s So-Called "Collective Measures" Plan Undermines the Basic Principles of the UN Charter

In this regard, it is worth noting the speech of the Swedish representative yesterday, who emphasized that the UN General Assembly passed the resolution called "United Action for Peace" the year before last, according to which the Assembly acquired the power to make recommendations for coercive measures – fundamentally illegal recommendations, the Assembly chose this path – let me add here: seriously undermining the basic principles and standards of the UN Charter – as the Swedish representative said, from the point of view of world peace, this is an adventure. The Swedish representative explained that, in the current situation, the intervention of the majority faction is more likely to make people believe that the situation of the world's countries being sharply and permanently divided into two blocs exists, and this situation is likely to develop into a future world war.

This speech by the Swedish representative can, of course, only be understood as an acknowledgement (albeit a timid one) of the fact that the so-called "collective measures" plan, which stipulates this kind of intervention, cannot only not become a guarantee for consolidating peace and reducing the threat of war – even though US representative Mr. Cohen talked about this guarantee yesterday, and US Secretary of State Mr. Acheson also talked about this guarantee in his New Year's speech on December 31 – but, in the words of the Swedish representative, it is an adventure from the point of view of world peace.

If these so-called collective measures bring UN member states (especially small countries) to the edge of the abyss of war, if these so-called collective measures force them to slide on the sharpest edge in the world – the edge of a war that is being prepared and is in danger of breaking out – then what is the value of these so-called collective measures?

Therefore, it is not accidental that Sweden took a very cautious attitude towards the so-called "collective measures" proposal, as we all saw yesterday, and reserved the right to express its final opinion on specific measures after studying the report.

However, one cannot agree with the Swedish representative's view that the report of the so-called "Collective Measures" Committee only involves technical issues that may arise in the implementation of international sanctions. The issues raised in the report are not merely technical, they are political issues. Moreover, what is most noteworthy is the political aspect of this report and the political direction followed by its drafters, which fully reflects the policies pursued by those countries they represent in international affairs under the leadership of the United States.

The Swedish representative said that some other countries – UN member states – currently do not intend to undertake any obligations in participating in collective measures that may only be unanimously adopted by a majority of major powers, in other words, not by all major powers. The Swedish representative also emphasized that there is actually a huge difference between the concerted action of major powers and the obvious state of opposition between major powers.

The Swedish representative said: In the latter case, that is, when consensus cannot be obtained among major powers, "participating in sanctions may lead to participating in a war between major powers worldwide." It should be pointed out that the entire "collective measures" plan ultimately comes down to sanctions, that is, fighting against countries that are declared aggressors. He also said that the Swedish government firmly believes that it "cannot undertake the obligation to participate in sanctions that may be implemented if participating in such sanctions risks dragging Sweden into a world war."

Later, we will discuss this issue again, which is directly related to the attempt to deprive the Security Council of its rights and powers to take measures to defend peace and international security. We will only talk about what has already been said now, in order to draw everyone's attention to the fact that the so-called "collective measures" are completely worthless and can only increase the threat to peace and international security.

Here, we cannot ignore the undeniable fact that it was precisely the war launched by the US interventionists in Korea that became the pretext for forcing the United Nations to pass the so-called "United Action for Peace" resolution the year before last, and now they want to use this pretext to force the United Nations to accept the so-called "collective measures" proposed in the report of the "Collective Measures" Committee; the vast majority of the members of this committee belong to the Atlantic bloc.

The U.S.'s Robbery of the Korean People Proves the Aggressive Nature of "Collective Measures"

When talking about the relationship between the "collective measures" plan and the Korean incident, I must quote many very authoritative statements. First, I would like to talk about Mr. Acheson's same New Year's speech at the banquet at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. The Jewish War Veterans Association presented Mr. Acheson with a gold medal at this banquet. In this speech, Mr. Acheson said that the events in Korea have proven that collective security can be effective, and the creation of the "collective security" plan was driven by the development of the situation in Korea.

Regarding what has already been discussed, it is not superfluous to mention Dulles's speech on October 9, 1950. In this speech, Dulles pointed out that the "United Action for Peace" resolution passed by the Assembly the year before last was prompted by the Korean incident. Dulles said that this incident proved that the United Nations can serve as an effective tool for deterring aggression, and to accomplish this task, it is necessary to eliminate the organization's weakness. In this way, he clearly emphasized the relationship between the "collective measures" plan and the Korean incident, and every conscientious, just, and unbiased person knows that the Korean incident is nothing more than the US armed aggression in Korea.

I once again warn those who attempt to portray the events in Korea as "North Korean aggression." You should not just make empty talk and empty speeches, insisting that this is so-called "communist" aggression from North Korea. Instead, you should refute the documents we have presented: Professor Oliphant's letters, the statements of the Syngman Rhee regime's ambassador to Washington, and the statements of responsible figures in the American camp. All of these documents unequivocally demonstrate that this was a deliberately prepared and carefully planned US armed aggression against Korea. You should refute this fact here, before us, once and for all!

Up to now, for two years, we have not even heard anyone suggest that this fact can be refuted, because all unfounded denials, all unfounded statements saying that this is "North Korean aggression" cannot be considered to have refuted this fact. We have presented these documents. Not only have they not been refuted, but they have even been confirmed. I would like to ask you to at least recall Professor Oliphant's letters published in American newspapers. He confirmed my views on this issue at the Fifth UN General Assembly, explaining that the military events in Korea were the result of American aggression. So far, all of this has not been refuted, and I am convinced that it will never be refuted.

As for eliminating the weakness of the United Nations, everyone knows that the US-British bloc resolved this issue at the Fifth Assembly – they illegally deprived the Security Council of the rights and powers conferred upon it by the Charter, and illegally transferred these rights and powers to the Assembly and some organizations to be established, such as military executive bodies. The Committee's report states that this kind of organization is the main working body for implementing the so-called "collective measures."

Everyone knows that all of these illegal measures are disguised with absolutely powerless and false motives, such as saying that the Security Council is unable to fulfill its responsibilities, that the Security Council is "paralyzed," the veto, etc.

The US-British bloc attempts to conceal these blatant violations of the Charter by saying that these measures are being taken because it is necessary to resist "North Korean aggression," saying that these so-called "collective measures" will enable the United Nations to fulfill its responsibilities in the future, suppress all aggression, and defend the victims of aggression. These reasons are all complete lies. As for the events in Korea, the claim of so-called "North Korean aggression" has been refuted more than once.

Speaking of this, I cannot help but talk about a passage from Mr. Acheson's speech that the American representative repeated here yesterday: The events in Korea have shown that collective action in accordance with the Charter can be implemented. However, what is being done in Korea under the banner and signboard of the United Nations not only does not conform to the UN Charter but is a complete mockery of the UN Charter, just like the "United Action for Peace" resolution itself, and the measures now being presented to us, which are called "collective measures."

But what is happening in Korea now is robbery, heinous robbery.

Korea is in the flames of war. Shocking atrocities against the Korean people are constantly being carried out. Tens of thousands of civilians – children, women, and the elderly – are constantly dying under the weapons of the interventionists. They are being massacred by napalm bombs, artillery, and machine guns.

However, the American representative tells us here that this is a beginning, a beginning of the gradual development of effective collective security!

Undoubtedly, this alone most powerfully proves the aggressive nature of these so-called collective measures! Korea has become a victim of these measures.

Now, they are asking you countries that have not yet participated in the Korean War gamble to provide troops, to provide manpower – now, they are asking you to pass this so-called "collective measures" plan, to ask you to assume obligations to continue to promote this so-called "effective collective security system" based on the American intervention in Korea.

The U.S.'s Insistence on Calling Aggression "Defense" is a Futile Attempt to Conceal its Despicable Aggressive Face

In order to somehow justify this shocking plan of aggressive measures, which is described as collective defense measures, the majority of the Political Committee also supports the absurd rumor that there is a danger of aggression from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and they themselves are spreading this absurd rumor. They are doing this clearly with provocative purposes.

We also remember that when Mr. Acheson talked about the current international tense situation at the Fifth UN General Assembly meeting, he tried hard to make us believe that the root of all difficulties lies in – according to him – the new Soviet imperialism, in the increase of the Soviet armed forces, which are said to far exceed the needs of defense and therefore constitute a threat to peace.

This year, Mr. Acheson reviewed the United States' foreign policy in 1951 and summarized the effectiveness of this policy in the Near East and the Middle East. He also said: This region is of unparalleled importance to the United States in terms of its people, resources, strategic location, and important transportation routes. He also said that the dangerous changes in this region are the crisis in the issue of defending the Suez Canal and the deadlock in the issue of utilizing Iranian oil resources.

So, the facts prove that the whole problem lies here! However, Acheson also said that these two facts both illustrate the possibility of danger being exploited by the Kremlin. What does the Kremlin have to do with this? According to Acheson's New Year's speech, the Iranian people want to maintain their independence, to maintain their right to freely dispose of their own natural resources, to resist the British government's infringement on this independence and right with the support of the United States, this action is entirely due to the "Kremlin's conspiracy." But is this statement in accordance with the facts?

When Mr. Acheson talks about the crisis in the issue of defending the Suez Canal and the deadlock in the issue of utilizing Iranian oil resources here, he is obviously distorting the facts. Since this is the case, what else is he talking about the development of the situation in Egypt? (Regarding this development, of course, the Egyptian representative can explain it better here than I can.)

The reason why they want to play so many tricks is just to portray this "collective measures" plan as "defensive," to make it seem as if these defensive measures are being taken because it is necessary to defend against a certain danger. They say that these dangers are coming from the Soviet Union, even though Acheson knows very well that these "dangers" are just ridiculous fantasies!

We have also heard the same speeches at this session, mainly the speeches of the representatives of the United States and some Latin American countries. These countries are still adopting the previous policy of distorting the facts, inciting hatred towards peace-loving nations, and arousing unfounded fear and anxiety for their own safety and happiness. This kind of activity is particularly intense in the United States; the more people who can be deceived by false words and fabricated facts decrease, the more frenzied their activities become.

US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, in a recent speech, also had the same purpose of arousing war panic among the general public. He does not let go of any opportunity to make base slanders against us, saying that we have some aggressive actions. He made this speech not only out of hatred for our country, but also to divert the attention of world opinion in order to hide the true aggressive intentions of the Atlantic bloc. Resolution 377 of November 3, 1950, and the so-called "collective measures" are closely linked to the plans of this bloc.

The leaders of the Atlantic bloc have not denied this: as General Bradley recently said, the security of the United States depends on the balance of the country's various forces, and depends on the formulation of a plan to establish international collective balanced forces on the basis of the Atlantic Treaty. The "collective measures" plan formulated by the Fourteen-Nation Committee aims to establish this kind of collective balanced force based on the Atlantic Treaty that General Bradley talked about.

In this way, there is a direct and fundamental connection between the program, goals, and tasks of the North Atlantic Treaty and the program, goals, and tasks of the "collective measures." Therefore, there is no need to be surprised that the "collective measures" plan presented in this report to the UN General Assembly is not a plan for "united action to safeguard peace" as the Fourteen-Nation Committee said, but a plan that contains the aggressive intentions of a group of warmongering countries, these countries are actually conspiring against peaceful and peace-loving countries.

The U.S.-Controlled "Collective Measures" Committee Has Embarked on the Road of Preparing for World War

Just looking at, for example, Chapter 3, "Economic and Financial Measures," and its Items 43 to 45 of this report is enough to believe that the so-called "collective measures" are precisely of this nature; this chapter and these three items, with the open shamelessness and cunning insidiousness of a profiteer, consider how the country against which economic measures are to be taken – the victim of "collective measures" – "feels about economic measures."

The report of the Fourteen-Nation Committee, according to the report itself, discusses the best way to harm a country – the victim of "collective measures" – the best and most effective way to impose sanctions on the economy of this country, in order to crush its resistance and strangle it if its actions and policies are considered aggressive by this committee of the Atlantic bloc. But where did this report get the means that it considers appropriate? This committee does not hide this. The committee frankly answered this question in its report. The report says this on this point: The ideas about the economic measures mentioned in this report are relatively new. This kind of measure was an important means in the war policy of the Napoleonic Wars era. At that time, this kind of measure did not produce satisfactory results. Only the industrial revolution has made the country easily vulnerable to this kind of action in modern times.

In this way, this kind of measure proposed by this committee already has its history; this kind of measure even occupied a very important position in the war policy of the Napoleonic Wars era. This set of measures, which is said to be "relatively new," is indeed an important means of Napoleon's "continental blockade" and has been around for almost one hundred and fifty years!

If Napoleon's aggressive wars and Napoleon's war of aggression against Russia in 1812 did not get "satisfactory" results but instead caused the failure of the aggressors – which is fortunate for all mankind – that is only because, according to this report, there were no environments that could produce this kind of "satisfactory" result (that is, the enslavement of another country and the success of Napoleonic aggression), no such historical conditions. According to the drafters of the report, the reason why "satisfactory" results could not be obtained at that time was because the era was different, because at that time, the industrial revolution had not yet made countries as vulnerable to this kind of action as they are in modern times.

A page of the committee's report on actions praises the aggressive wars of the Napoleonic era and expresses regret that those aggressive wars did not produce "satisfactory" results because the industrial revolution at that time had not been able to make one country or another that was attacked so vulnerable; gentlemen, can there be anything more shameful than this page of the report?

This is the "plan to defend peace" that the unfortunate drafters of "collective measures" have exposed. They are now trying to lure the General Assembly with this "new" "method," this "important tool of military policy" from the era of the Napoleonic wars, passing off these methods as ways to maintain peace and guarantee international security... But the United States has been implementing this plan. The United States has implemented embargoes, implemented the Battle Act, and does not allow goods to be exported to the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Now the United States is trying to use the United Nations in order to cover up its aggressive policies in the name of this organization. However, this attempt will not succeed.

This trick will not succeed. These "collective measures" will only expose the actual purpose of this entire plan, and will only provide new evidence that the Atlantic bloc headed by the United States and the so-called "Collective Measures" Committee that follows the Atlantic bloc have embarked on the road of preparing for another world war.

The entire activity of the Atlantic bloc is currently to use the industrial potential of the United States, Britain, and France and the countries that support them for war purposes. The leaders of the Atlantic bloc no longer hide this. This can be seen from General Bradley's speech quoted above, in which he has confirmed that the task of the Atlantic bloc is to seek all benefits for the United States from the United States' atomic advantage, as he said. General Eisenhower's answers to fourteen questions about war and peace published in the Paris "Competition" magazine on October 27, 1951, also confirm this.

From General Eisenhower's reply, it can be clearly seen that, according to the military operation plans drafted by the General Staff of the North Atlantic Group, the Northern European Command of this headquarters will direct military operations near Leningrad, the Southern European Command will direct military operations in Hungary and Austria, and the Middle East armed forces that the American generals still want to use will conduct military operations in southern Russia. You see, Leningrad, southern Russia, some important roads leading to the Soviet Union – Austria and Hungary!

Of course, this is not the whole plan. This is just a little bit that General Eisenhower felt it necessary to tell others. But this little bit alone is enough to show what this so-called defense plan is. Just from the fact that this plan is almost exactly copied from similar plans of Hitler's generals, this so-called defense plan is very clear. The US government is now very happy to use Hitler's generals to serve it!

Eisenhower finally said in answering these questions: When all the forces of the Atlantic Group are established (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has prepared the plan), there is no doubt that they will be able to fight far beyond the Rhine.

If only for the fact that it exposes what the staff and generals of the Atlantic Group are doing in the office, General Eisenhower's explicit talk is certainly very worthy of our attention. This talk fully exposes the bellicose intentions of the initiators and organizers of this group.

People are Gradually Recognizing the U.S.'s Aggressive Ambitions and that its So-Called Love of Peace is Completely a Lie

Now, there are not many people who still believe that the Atlantic Treaty is for any defensive purpose. Few people have not realized that the Atlantic Group's repeated expressions of love for peace are completely false, and few people are not gradually realizing day by day that the real threat to peace and the security of all nations comes precisely from the Atlantic Group. There are very few simple-minded people who do not realize this.

Therefore, the following is not accidental: Even the Paris correspondent of the American "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" had to admit: Currently, most French people will firmly answer the war-mongers that the Soviet Union has no intention of invading Europe. In fact, it is very easy to get the French to believe that the Soviet Union wants peace, but it is very difficult to get them to believe that the United States wants peace, because even when the United States emphasizes its peaceful intentions, it must bared its fangs and claws, and use its Atlantic alliance weapons to threaten people.

This is a completely fair comment on the Atlantic Group that is quite common. Anyone who can maintain an objective mind and has the ability to observe the truth of things holds this view.

US Representative from North Carolina Dean, after traveling in Europe for three weeks, returned and published his impressions. He said that during his trip to Western Europe, he had talked to representative citizens in every strategic area, and he got the impression that: In fact, the problem is whether the United States, as the initiator of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, can put forward a weighty ideal of struggle... His observations convinced him that if the United States does not immediately put forward this kind of ideal, then once a serious incident occurs, any large-scale European war will have to be carried out by American youth themselves.

The United States can only put forward one ideal, which it has already embodied in the plans of the Atlantic Group. This ideal is that American monopoly capitalists dominate the world, and this goal must be achieved by any means and at any cost, even at the cost of launching a new world war. The American aggressive ruling group is blinded by this "ideal," stubbornly opposes all plans to establish international peaceful cooperation, and relies on their economic and military power to continue to implement policies of violence and oppression. British economist and well-known representative of bourgeois science Hobson, in his book "Imperialism," described the characteristics of American imperialism, and his description is especially true now.

"Messrs. Rockefeller, Morgan, Hanna, Schwab, and their associates need imperialism, and it is they who have made this great Western republic an imperialist country. They need imperialism because they want to use their national resources to find profitable investments, otherwise these resources will prove to be redundant..." He went on to say: "In order to pursue more profit-making opportunities, American industrialists and financiers have to turn their eyes to China, the Pacific, and South American countries... They will strive as much as possible to completely monopolize these markets, and the competition from Germany, Britain, and other trading countries will prompt them to establish special political relations with these markets that have the greatest value to them. Cuba, the Philippines, and Hawaii are just 'appetizers' to stimulate appetite... In the implementation of imperialist plans, the country's expenses will be a huge source of wealth for those people, that is, the financiers who lend money, the subsidized shipbuilders and shipowners, and the suppliers and manufacturers who provide the imperialists with weapons and other equipment."

Although this passage was written half a century ago, it is still very suitable today. The above-mentioned characteristics of American imperialism determine the entire content and direction of American foreign policy today. These characteristics can also explain many measures of the US government. If we take recent examples, there is the law of October 10, 1951, which funds American spies to carry out sabotage activities in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the proposal to reduce armaments in name but actually legalize further expansion of armaments, the proposal named "United Action for Peace" but actually deepening the division in the United Nations and strengthening the United States' control over it, and the proposal for a plan that is being discussed named "collective measures" but is actually preparing for a new war.

All of these measures are driven by the American "ideal" of world hegemony, they are all a continuation of the same aggressive policy of American foreign policy, and the American ruling group still clings to this policy and does not intend to give up no matter what. Regarding this aspect, we feel that it seems necessary to talk a little bit about the results of the work of the first half of the session of this UN General Assembly.

The U.S. Has Repeatedly Suffered Defeats in the General Assembly and the Difficulties of the Rearmament Plan are Constantly Increasing

The American aggressive group is trying to portray this result as beneficial to them, and they almost want to say that this is a series of their victories. But these so-called "victories" are "pyrrhic victories." For example, although the American delegation used all possible means of oppression and intimidation, desperately trying to make Greece replace Belarus, which had every legal right to be elected to the Security Council, all of these activities carried out by the American delegation clearly suffered a moral and political defeat. Isn't it true that Greece was illegally "elected" only with great difficulty on the nineteenth vote? In the previous eighteen votes, the United States suffered defeat again and again. Even the "New York Herald Tribune" editorial on December 23 of last year had to admit that the American representatives brazenly used all possible pressure during the election. The methods used by the United States in this situation have been revealed by a news item published by the Swedish "Morning Post," which said that Sweden had received a formal condemnation from the US Embassy in Stockholm because Sweden dared to express its own opinions in the United Nations. This newspaper said: "It is noteworthy that the major powers use pressure on small countries in this way on issues related to the United Nations..."

Wasn't American foreign policy also defeated when discussing the law of October 10, 1951, which stipulated the allocation of 100 million US dollars to carry out subversive activities in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries? At that time, the American delegation and the delegations that supported them proved that they could not even fabricate some flowery words to explain this unprecedented destruction of the basic principles and standards of international law, to explain this serious violation of the 1933 Soviet-American agreement by the American government. Wasn't the result of this vote, in which the "non-communist governments" of eleven countries representing more than 571 million people refused to support the United States, also showed the failure of the United States? Isn't it true that even the Latin American countries did not unanimously support the United States? Can such facts be used as a basis for clamoring about "victory"? Therefore, it is not accidental that more sober-minded American newspapers also had to admit that the atmosphere at the beginning of the Christmas recess of the Sixth UN General Assembly showed that the prestige of the United States in the various committees of the Assembly had plummeted. It was also said that not only among the representatives of the Middle Eastern countries and several Asian countries, but even within the Western camp, the voices of "dissenters" began to be heard.

If our meeting was adjourned for the Christmas recess in a rather depressed atmosphere, then there is nothing wrong with saying that when it resumed yesterday, it was in an even more "depressed atmosphere." Therefore, I have no doubt that when our meeting summarizes the achievements of the entire Sixth General Assembly meeting in the future, it will be even more disappointing.

At the same time, this newspaper drew attention to the obvious contradiction between the US government's so-called "disarmament" proposals and the simultaneous extortion of a large number of divisions from European countries.

For example, Belgium is very alarmed by these demands from the United States and the inevitable increase in military spending caused by them. Isn't this true? The liberal newspaper "Modern Daily" published an article a few days ago entitled "The Burden of Military Spending Exceeds the Limits That Belgium Can Afford." The Catholic trade union newspaper "City Daily" published the Belgian representative's talk at the Harriman Committee, in which he said that Belgium "has reached its limit," and said, "Belgium can no longer give gifts to its neighbors for the sake of Atlantic unity."

But despite the increasing difficulties in implementing the rearmament plan, the United States is still recklessly advancing along this road and is trying its best to drag the governments of the main member states of the Atlantic Group to move forward together, although some of these countries have admitted that they can no longer bear the burden of this arms race. Indeed, the situation in these countries is not enviable. For example, the following is the talk of Mr. Churchill, the head of the British government – one of the main partners of the United States in the Atlantic Group – about the current situation in Britain. Everyone knows that Christmas carols praise "God in heaven, peace on earth, and happiness to mankind." It is said that there is this kind of peace and happiness on earth. But Mr. Churchill's speech before Christmas said a lot of tragic things about the situation in Britain.

Churchill compared Britain to a train traveling downhill from the mountain at a speed of sixty miles per hour on the wrong track. He said: "If you build a brick wall on the track in order to stop it, it will be useless... This will only cause the brick wall to be smashed, the train to be damaged, and the passengers to be injured or killed. The first thing to do is to install brakes." He said: The Chancellor of the Exchequer has already done this, and the train can be slowly controlled and stopped. Then the locomotive must be reversed and move forward along the correct route.

I think this speech is noteworthy. It raises some questions, although it raises them in a metaphorical way; these questions need some explanation, and I hope that I can get an explanation for these questions here. For example, what does the wrong route refer to? What is the brick wall? If obstacles are built to stop the train running on the wrong track, why will all the passengers certainly be injured or killed, and the train itself will certainly be damaged? All of these are quite vague, but one thing is clear: the British train is running on the wrong track and must be stopped by installing brakes, turned around so that it can start again and move forward on the correct track.

    关于美国的所谓“集体措施”计划——准备战争的计划
    ——维辛斯基一九五二年一月三日在联合国政治委员会上的发言全文
    我们大家都记得，关于所谓“集体措施”的问题，已经在前年第五届联合国大会上讨论过了，结果通过了以“保障和平的联合行动”的虚伪称号为名的一个决议。这个决议，被说成是巩固和平的纲领。这个决议，通篇是什么必须消除战争威胁呀、必须以保障和平的联合行动抵制侵略危机呀一类的欺人之谈。实际上，这个决议并不是巩固和平的纲领，而是准备新战争的纲领，而且它的目的是制造发动这种战争、达到这种目标的一切必要条件。
    这个决议的出现，无疑是和美国对北朝鲜的侵略有关系的，美国对北朝鲜的侵略，一方面表明，发动这个战争的美国垄断资本家的冒险政策已经没有成功的希望；另一方面表明，他们如果不把在经济和政治上依附美国的其他国家拖到这个军事冒险里面去，就不能应付在这个战争中所发生的局势。
    美国国务卿艾奇逊先生除夕在纽约发表的演说以及上述提案的一些起草人昨天的发言，都证实了美国对北朝鲜的侵略与前年的“保障和平的联合行动”决议和所谓“集体措施”提案的出现之间的关系。上述提案的起草人昨天曾经直接地说：朝鲜事件是产生“保障和平的联合行动”和现在的所谓“集体措施”提案的条件。
    参加侵朝战争的不是联合国而是美国侵略者的附庸国家
    在“集体措施委员会”关于所谓“集体措施”的报告中，包括有第四号特别附录，专门讨论朝鲜问题的经过，这并不是偶然的。从这个文件就可以看出：的确是朝鲜事件促使一些盗用国际组织的名义、采取据说是抵抗侵略的行动的国家卷入了联合武力行动的措施。
    为了把美国对北朝鲜的武装干涉说成是广泛——如果不是普遍的话——援助李承晚傀儡政权，报告中把事情说成好像是这样的：有四十七个联合国会员国和两个非会员国决定参加所谓“援助”，并且有其他许多国家决定对这个事业提供陆军。
    报告说：二十五个国家的政府已提供武装部队支持在朝鲜的军事行动，二十个国家为了同一目的已提供了地面部队，八个国家出了海军，四个国家出了空军。报告中并没有掩饰使用日本基地的事情，如报告中所说的，这件事是极为重要的。
    可是，应当指出：报告中这一节所谈的以及整个报告中附带谈到的这一方面的事情，一点也不符合事情的真相。实际上，从第二号补充文件可以看出，除了美国、英国及英国的自治领以外，参加朝鲜战争的只有比利时、法国、哥伦比亚、丹麦（它派了医院船“朱特兰地亚”号到朝鲜去，根据可靠的消息说，这条船已经被召回国了）、希腊、荷兰、菲律宾和土耳其八个国家。这就是所谓整个联合国组织参加反对朝鲜人民的战争。八个国家——只派了一艘医院船而后来并没有继续干下去的丹麦、派了
    一旅人的土耳其、菲律宾、希腊、荷兰、哥伦比亚、比利时、法国。全部情形就是这样。难道能够说联合国参加了这个战争吗？难道能够说有四十七个联合国会员国参加了吗？这是决不符合实际情形的。说这种话的唯一目的是想把美国对朝鲜的侵略
    （大西洋侵略集团中有一些成员国参加了这次侵略）说成像报告中所说的那样，实际上有整个联合国参加，并借联合国的名义来掩盖美国的这种侵略。
    大家又都知道，只有三十八个政府答复了所谓“集体措施”委员会中的秘书处的代表向联合国所有会员国提出的关于它们已依照第三百七十七号“保障和平的联合行动”决议采取了何种措施的问题；而它们的答复证明美国要拼凑它的“集体措施”体系是非常困难的。实际上，二十二个国家的政府对于秘书长的问题根本没有答复，而其余提出答复的三十八个政府——包括所谓国民党“政府”——中，只有十八个政府同意拨出若干数额的武装部队参加集体措施；九个政府（危地马拉、印度、巴基斯坦、洪都拉斯、沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克、利比里亚、缅甸、委内瑞拉）以各种不同的理由拒绝参加集体措施；七个政府（海地、智利、瑞典、埃及、以色列、厄瓜多尔、南斯拉夫）的答复闪烁其词，等于拒绝参加；四个政府（玻利维亚、印度尼西亚、卢森堡、墨西哥）的答复只是说明它们已收到了联合国秘书处代表的问题。
    这样，六十个联合国会员国中，有二十二个国家的政府并没有答复秘书处的问题，即：它们准备参加集体措施，特别是参加朝鲜战争的程度和形式的问题；其他十八个政府表示同意出若干武装部队参加集体措施；九个国家的政府以各种不同的理由拒绝参加；七个国家的政府的答复闪烁其词，等于拒绝参加；四个国家的政府只是答复说收到了问题。
    后来，在这里发言的人们又进而对我们说，联合国参加了朝鲜战争。不是的，先生们，让我们为联合国和联合国的荣誉说一声幸运吧，参加朝鲜战争的不是联合国，只是美国的附庸国，只是在经济和财政上依附美国的仆从国家。
    还应该指出，有些提出了肯定答复的政府，仅仅是在形式上答复罢了。例如巴西政府就仅仅提出诺言说，它要尽可能把它的武装部队置于联合国的指挥之下；澳大利亚政府辩解说，它已经参加了在朝鲜和马来亚的军事行动；而新西兰政府则说，它现在已经在朝鲜担当的义务和它的地区防务的需要，不许可它在目前提供更多的军队了。
    这一切都足以说明联合国绝大多数会员国对于用自己的武装部队参加美国对北朝鲜的干涉以及参加一般集体措施这种事情的真正态度。同时，这一切也充分驳倒了所谓“集体措施”委员会的报告中所包含的绝对没有根据的武断之词，那个报告里说：秘书处所提出来的这个问题，受到联合国会员国的广泛的、实际上是普遍的响应。
    美国的所谓“集体措施”计划破坏了联合国宪章基本原则
    在这方面，值得严重注意的是瑞典代表昨天的发言，瑞典代表着重地说，联合国大会前年通过了名叫“保障和平的联合行动”的决议，根据这种决议，大会取得了权力，得以提出采取强制性措施的建议——根本非法的建议，大会选择这条道路——让我在这里加一句：严重地破坏了联合国宪章的基本原则和标准——如瑞典代表所说，从世界和平的观点上看来，这是一种冒险。瑞典代表解释说：在目前的情况下，多数派方面的干涉，更容易使人们认为世界各国截然而永久地分裂成为两个集团的局面是存在的，而这种局面是可能发展成为将来的世界大战的。
    瑞典代表的这种发言，当然只可以理解为一种承认（固然是怯懦的承认），承认这样一个事实，就是：规定进行这种干涉的所谓“集体措施”计划，不仅不能成为巩固和平并减轻战争威胁的保证——尽管昨天美国代表柯亨先生谈的正是这种保证，美国国务卿艾奇逊先生十二月三十一日的新年演说中谈的也是这种保证——而且，用瑞典代表的话来说，从世界和平的观点上看来，这是一种冒险。
    如果这种所谓集体措施把联合国会员国（特别是小国）带到了战争深渊的边缘，如果这种所谓集体措施强迫它们在世界上现有的最锋利的刀刃——正在准备中而且有爆发之虞的战争的刀刃——上滑动，那末，这种所谓集体措施有什么价值呢？
    因此，像昨天我们大家都看到的，瑞典对于所谓“集体措施”的提案采取了很慎重的态度，并且保留在研究了报告以后再表示对于具体措施的最后意见的权利，这一点并不是偶然的。
    可是人们不能同意瑞典代表的这种意见，即所谓“集体措施”委员会的报告仅仅是涉及在施行国际制裁的时候可能引起的技术问题。报告中所提出来的问题，并不仅仅是技术性的，这些问题是政治性的问题。不但如此，最可注意的，就是这个报告的政治方面和它的起草人所遵循的政治方针，这种政治方针充分地反映了他们所代表的那些国家在美国的领导下在国际事务上所执行的政策。
    瑞典代表发言说，其他一些国家——联合国会员国——目前不打算在参加可能只是由多数大国，换句话说，不是全体大国所一致通过的集体措施方面担当任何义务。瑞典代表又着重指出：大国行动一致和大国处于明显的对立状态这二者之间实际上是有巨大差别的。
    瑞典代表说：在后一种情况下，就是说，在大国间不能获得一致时，“如果参加制裁就可能导致参加全世界大国之间的战争”。应当指出：整个“集体措施”计划归根结底说来是制裁，这就是说对被宣布为侵略者的国家作战。他又说，瑞典政府确定地认为—它“不能担当参加可能实行的制裁的义务，如果参加那种制裁有把瑞典拖入世界战争的危险的话”。
    以后，我们还会再讨论到这个问题，这个问题是与企图剥夺安全理事会的为了保卫和平与国际安全而采取措施的权利与权力一事直接有关的。我们现在只谈已经说过的事，以求引起大家注意，所谓
    “集体措施”是毫不足取的，它只能增加对和平与国际安全的威胁。
    我们在这里也不能忽视这样一个不可辩驳的事实：正是美国干涉者在朝鲜所发动的战争成为前年强使联合国通过所谓“保障和平的联合行动”案的藉口，现在又想以这个藉口来强使联合国接受“集体措施”委员会的报告中提出的所谓“集体措施”；这个委员会的绝大多数成员都是属于大西洋集团的。
    美国对朝鲜人民的强盗行为证明了“集体措施”的侵略本质
    谈到“集体措施”计划与朝鲜事件的关系时，我必须引用一下许多十分权威的谈话。首先，我要谈谈艾奇逊先生在华道夫·亚斯多里亚饭店宴会上的同一篇新年演说。犹太退伍军人协会在这次宴会上曾以一个金质纪念章赠给艾奇逊。艾奇逊先生在这篇演说中说，朝鲜的事件已经证明：集体安全是可以发生效力的，“集体安全”计划的产生正是以朝鲜局势的发展作为推动力的。
    关于已经谈过的事情，来提一下杜勒斯在一九五○年十月九日所发表的演说并不是多余的。杜勒斯在这篇演说中指出，大会前年通过的“保障和平的联合行动”案是由朝鲜事件促成的，杜勒斯说这件事证明了联合国可以作为抑止侵略的有效工具，要完成这个任务就必须消除这个组织的孱弱性。这样，他就明白地强调了“集体措施”计划和朝鲜事件的关系，而每一个有良心的、公正的、无偏见的人都知道朝鲜事件不是别的，就是美国在朝鲜的武装侵略。
    我再一次正告那些企图把事情说成好像朝鲜的军事事件是“北朝鲜的侵略”的人们。你们不应该只是发表空话和空洞的演说，硬说这是来自北朝鲜的所谓“共产主义”侵略。而应该驳倒我们所提出的文件：奥利伏教授的信件，李承晚政权驻华盛顿大使的声明，美国阵营负责人物的声明。所有这些文件都毫无疑义地说明，这是经过蓄意准备和周密计划的美国武装部队对朝鲜的侵略。你们应当在这里，在我们面前，一劳永逸地驳倒这一事实！
    到现在为止，两年来，我们甚至没有听到有人暗示过可以驳倒这一事实，因为，一切毫无事实根据的否认，一切说这是“北朝鲜侵略”的毫无事实根据的声明都不能被认为已经驳倒了这一事实。我们提出了这些文件。它们不但没有被驳倒，甚至得到了证实。我愿请你们至少回想一下奥利伏教授在美国报纸上发表的信件。他证实了我在第五届联合国大会上就这一问题发表的意见，说明朝鲜的军事事件是美国侵略的结果。迄今为止，这一切还没有被驳倒，而且我深信也决不会被驳倒。
    至于消除联合国的孱弱性，大家知道，美英集团已在第五届大会上解决了这一问题——他们非法剥夺了宪章赋予安全理事会的权利和权力，把这些权利和权力非法移交给大会和一些待成立的机构，如军事执行机构。委员会的报告说这种机构是执行所谓“集体措施”的主要工作机构。
    大家知道，所有这些非法措施都是用一些绝对没有力量的、虚假的动机来掩饰的，如像说安理会无力履行其职责，安理会陷于“瘫痪”，否决权等等。
    美英集团企图掩饰这些彰明较著地违反宪章的非法措施，说什么所以采取这些措施是由于必须抵抗“北朝鲜的侵略”，说什么这些所谓“集体措施”将使联合国将来能够履行其职责，镇压一切侵略，保卫被侵略者。这些理由都是彻头彻尾的谎话。至于朝鲜的事件，所谓“北朝鲜侵略”的说法已不止一次地被驳倒了。
    谈到这一点，我不能不谈谈美国代表昨天在这里重说了一遍的艾奇逊先生的一段话：朝鲜的事件已经说明，符合宪章的集体行动是可以实行的。但是，打着联合国的旗帜和招牌在朝鲜所做的事情不但不符合联合国宪章，而且是完全嘲弄了联合国宪章，正和“保障和平的联合行动”案本身一样，现在向我们提出的措施也是这样，这些措施美其名曰“集体措施”。
    但是，朝鲜现在发生的事情是强盗行为、可恶的强盗行为。
    朝鲜是在战火之中。对朝鲜人民的惊人暴行正在不断地进行着。成千成万的平民——儿童、妇女和老年人——不断地死在干涉者的武器之下。他们被凝固汽油弹、大炮和机关枪屠杀了。
    然而，美国代表在这里告诉我们说：这是一个开端，是有效的集体安全逐步发展的一个开端！
    毫无疑问，单是这件事就最有力地证明了这些所谓集体措施的侵略本质！朝鲜已经成了这些措施的牺牲者了。
    现在，他们要求你们还没有参加朝鲜战争赌博的国家提供军队，提供人力——现在，他们要求你们通过这个所谓“集体措施”计划，要求你们承担义务，继续推行这种以美国干涉朝鲜为基础的所谓“有效的集体安全制度”。
    美国硬把侵略行为说成“防御”是妄想掩饰它卑鄙的侵略面目
    为了多少替这个惊人的被形容为集体防御措施的侵略措施计划辩解，政治委员会的多数也支持那种无稽的谣言，说苏联和人民民主国家方面有进攻的危险，并且连它们自己也在散布这种无稽的谣言。它们这样显然是怀着挑衅的目的的。
    我们还记得，艾奇逊先生在第五届联合国大会会议上谈到目前的国际紧张局面时，竭力想使我们相信，一切困难的根源都在于——照他说——新的苏联帝国主义，在于苏联武装部队的增加，据说苏联的武装部队远超出国防的需要，因此就构成了对和平的威胁。
    今年，艾奇逊先生回顾了美国一九五一年的外交政策，并总结了这个政策在近东和中东的成效，他同时说：这个地区就其人民、资源、战略位置和重要的交通孔道地位来说，对于美国有无比重大的意义。他又说，这个地区的危险变化，就是在保卫苏彝士水道问题上的危机以及在利用伊朗石油资源上所发生的僵局。
    那么，事实证明整个问题就在这里了！然而，艾奇逊却又说，这两个事实都说明了被克里姆林利用的危险的可能性。克里姆林跟这有什么关系呢？照艾奇逊在新年演说中说，伊朗人民要保持他们的独立，要保持他们自由处理他们自己的天然富源的权利，要抵抗英国政府在美国支持下对这种独立与权利的侵犯，这种行动完全是出于“克里姆林的阴谋”。可是这种说法难道是合乎事实的吗？
    艾奇逊先生在这里谈到关于保卫苏彝士水道问题的危机以及利用伊朗石油资源问题上的僵局时，显然是歪曲了事实，既然这样，他还谈什么埃及局势的发展呢？（关于这种发展，当然埃及代表是能在这里比我更好地来说明的。）
    他们所以要玩弄这么些花样，不过是为了要把这个“集体措施”计划形容成为“防御性”的，要把事情说成是：这些防御措施是因为须要防御某种危险才采取的，他们说，这些危险是从苏联那边来的，虽然艾奇逊非常清楚地知道，这些“危险”只不过是荒唐的幻想而已！
    我们在本届会议上也听到了同样的发言，这主要是美国和某些拉丁美洲国家的代表的发言。这些国家仍然采用以前那种歪曲事实的政策，煽动对爱好和平的民族的仇恨，激起它们对自身的安全和幸福发生毫无根据的惊恐和忧惧。这种活动特别是在美国进行得最厉害；能够为虚伪的言辞和捏造的事实所欺骗的人愈是减少，他们这种活动也愈加狂热。
    美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷在最近一次发言中，也怀着这样的目的，要在一般人民当中引起对战争的惊惶情绪。他不放过一切机会，对我们发出卑污的诽谤，说我们有什么侵略行动。他发表这个谈话，不仅是出于对我国的憎恨，而且也是要想转移世界舆论的注意，以隐藏大西洋集团的真正侵略目的，一九五○年十一月三日的第三百七十七号决议和所谓“集体措施”是和这个集团的计划密切地联系着的。
    大西洋集团的头目们也没有否认这一点：如布莱德雷将军最近就说，美国的安全端赖于国家的各种部队的均衡，端赖于在大西洋公约的基础上建立国际集体均衡部队的计划之制定。十四国委员会制订出的“集体措施”计划，其目的正是建立布莱德雷将军谈过的这种以大西洋公约为基础的集体均衡部队。
    这样，在北大西洋公约的纲领、目的和任务与“集体措施”的纲领、目的和任务之间，就有着直接和根本的联系了。因此，无须惊奇，在提交联合国大会的这个报告中所提出的“集体措施”计划，并不是像十四国委员会所说的什么“保障和平的联合行动”的计划，而是包含着一群好战国家的侵略目的的计划，这些国家实际上是在阴谋反对和平的及爱好和平的国家。
    美国控制的“集体措施”委员会已走上了准备世界战争的道路
    只要看一看，譬如说，这个报告的第三章“经济和财政措施”及其第四十三至四十五项，就足以相信所谓“集体措施”恰恰是这种性质的；这一章和这三项以奸商的公然无耻和狡猾阴险的心计，考虑到经济措施所要反对的国家“对经济措施的感受”如何。
    十四国委员会的报告，据这个报告本身说，讨论了伤害一个国家——“集体措施”的受难者——的最好的方法、对这个国家的经济施行制裁的最好而最有效的方法，以便粉碎它的抵抗，将它扼杀，如果它的行动和政策被大西洋集团的这个委员会认为是具有侵略性的话。可是这个报告是从什么地方取得它所认为适当的是手段的呢？这个委员会并不隐讳这一点。这个委员会在它的报告中直率地答复了这个问题。报告在这一点上是这样说的：关于这个报告上所述及的经济措施的观念，是比较新鲜的。这种措施在拿破仑战争时代的战争政策中，是一种重要的手段。当时，这种措施并没有产生令人满意的效果。只有产业革命才使国家在现代容易受到这种行动的打击。
    这样看来，这个委员会所提出的这种措施，已经有它的历史了；这种措施甚至曾在拿破仑战争的时代的战争政策中占过很重要的地位。这种据说是“比较新鲜的”一套措施，的确是拿破仑的“大陆封锁”的重要手段，并且已经有差不多一百五十年的历史！
    如果说拿破仑的侵略战争和拿破仑在一八一二年进攻俄国的战争没有得到“令人满意的”结果，反而造成了侵略者的失败——这是全人类的幸运——那只是因为，据这个报告看来，没有可以产生这种
    “令人满意的”结果（也就是对于另一国的奴役和拿破仑式的侵略的成功）的环境，没有那种历史条件。据报告的起草人说，当时所以未能得到“令人满意的”结果，是因为时代不同，是因为在那个时候，产业革命还没有使国家像在现代这样容易受到这种行动的打击。
    委员会的关于行动的报告的一页，赞扬了拿破仑时代的侵略战争，并且表示遗憾说：那种侵略战争没有产生“令人满意”的结果，因为当时的产业革命还没有能使被进攻的一个国家或另一个国家那样容易受到打击；先生们，还能有比这一页报告更可耻的吗？
    这就是“集体措施”的倒霉的起草人已经暴露出来的“保卫和平的计划”。他们现在正试图以这个“新的”“办法”，这个拿破仑侵略战争时代的“军事政策的重要工具”来诱惑大会，把这些办法冒充为维持和平与保证国际安全的办法……但是美国已在执行这种计划。美国已执行了禁运，实施了巴特尔法，不准货物输出到苏联和各人民民主国家。现在美国正试图借助联合国，以便用这个组织的名义来掩盖它的侵略政策。可是，这种企图是不能成功的。
    这种诡计是不会得逞的。这种“集体措施”只会暴露这整个计划的实际目的，只会提供新的证据，说明以美国为首的大西洋集团和追随大西洋集团的所谓“集体措施”委员会，已走上了准备另一次世界战争的道路。
    大西洋集团的整个活动，目前是为了把美、英、法三国和支持它们的国家的工业潜力用在战争目的上。大西洋集团的领袖们已不再掩饰这一点了。从上面所引用的布莱德雷将军的演说中就可以看出这一点，他已经证实了，大西洋集团的任务是如他所说的从美国的原子优势中为美国谋取一切利益。艾森豪威尔将军一九五一年十月二十七日在巴黎“竞赛”杂志上发表的对十四个关于战争与和平的问题的答复，也证实了这一点。
    从艾森豪威尔将军的答复中可以明显地看出来：根据北大西洋集团参谋总部所草拟的军事行动计划，这个总部的北欧司令部将指挥列宁格勒附近的军事行动，南欧司令部将指挥匈牙利和奥地利的军事行动，而美国将领先生们还想利用的中东武装部队将在俄罗斯南部进行军事行动。你们瞧吧，列宁格勒、俄罗斯南部、通往苏联的一些要道——奥地利和匈牙利！
    自然，这不是整个的计划。这是艾森豪威尔将军觉得有必要告诉别人的一点儿。但是，仅仅这一点儿也足以说明这个所谓防御计划究竟是什么东西了。仅就这个计划几乎是原样照抄希特勒将领们的类似计划这一点来看，这个所谓防御计划也就是很清楚的了。美国政府现在非常乐意用希特勒的将领们来效劳哩！
    艾森豪威尔在答复这些问题时最后说：当大西洋集团的所有部队都建立起来以后（北大西洋公约组织已准备好了计划），毫无疑问的，它们就能在莱因河彼岸很远的地方作战。
    如果只就它暴露了大西洋集团的参谋们和将领们在办公室里所干的是什么工作这一点来说，艾森豪威尔将军露骨的谈话自然也是十分值得我们注意的。这个谈话完全暴露了这个集团的发起者和组织者的好战意图。
    人们逐渐认清美国的侵略野心它的所谓爱好和平完全是谎言
    现在，已经没有多少人还相信大西洋公约是为了什么防御目的的了。很少有人还没有认识到，大西洋集团口口声声表示爱好和平是彻头彻尾虚伪的，很少有人不是一天天逐渐认识到，和平及各国人民安全所受到的真正威胁恰恰是来自大西洋集团。认识不到这层道理的头脑简单的人已经很少很少了。
    因此下面的事并不是偶然的：连美国“圣路易邮报”驻巴黎记者也不得不承认：目前，大多数法国人民会坚决地回答战争贩子说，苏联并没有侵略欧洲的意图，事实上要叫法国人相信苏联要和平是很容易的，可是要叫他们相信美国要和平那就很难办到了，因为美国即使在强调它的和平意图的时候，也要张牙舞爪，拿出它那大西洋联盟的武器来恐吓人。
    这是相当普遍的对大西洋集团的完全公正的评语，凡是能够保持客观头脑、有能力观察事物真实情况的人都抱着这种见解。
    美国北卡罗来纳州众议员丁恩在欧洲旅行了三个星期之后，回去发表了他的印象记。他说，在他在西欧旅行的时候，他曾在每一个战略地区和当地有代表性的公民谈话，他得到的印象是：实际上，问题在于作为北大西洋公约组织发起者的美国是否能提出一个有分量的奋斗理想……他的观察使他深信，假如美国不马上提出这种理想，那么一旦发生严重的事变时，任何大规模的欧洲战争都得由美国青年自己来进行。
    美国只能提出一个理想，它早已使这“理想”体现在大西洋集团的计划中了。这个理想就是美国垄断资本家独霸世界，就是必须以任何手段、不惜任何代价来实现这个目标，甚至不惜发动新的世界战争。美国侵略性的统治集团被这种“理想”迷住了心窍，固执地反对一切要建立国际和平合作的打算，而依靠他们的经济和军事威力，继续执行强暴和压迫的政策。英国名经济学家、闻名的资产阶级科学的代表霍柏森在他的著作“帝国主义”一书中，描画了美帝国主义的特征，他这段描写尤其在现在最为真切。
    “洛克斐勒、摩根、汉纳、什瓦勃诸位先生以及他们的同伙们需要帝国主义，正是他们，才使这个伟大的西方共和国成了帝国主义国家。他们之所以需要帝国主义，是因为他们要利用他们的国家资源，来寻得有利可图的投资，否则这些资源就证明是多余的。……”他接着又说：“为了追求更多获取利润的机会，美国大工业家和金融家就得把他们的眼光投到中国、太平洋和南美诸国……他们将尽可能争取完全垄断这些市场，德国、英国和其他贸易国家的竞争将促使他们和这些对他们具有最重大价值的市场建立特别的政治关系。古巴、菲律宾和夏威夷不过是刺激食欲的‘小菜’而已……在实现帝国主义计划的时候，国家的支出将是那些人发财的巨大来源，这些人就是借钱给人的金融家、得到津贴的造船主和船主，供给帝国主义以武器及其他装备的供应商和制造商。”
    这段话虽然是半个世纪前写的，但是至今仍然非常适合。上面谈到的美帝国主义的特点，决定了美国今日外交政策的整个内容和方向。这些特点也可以说明美国政府的许多措施，如果举近的例子，那就有：资助美国特务在苏联和人民民主国家进行破坏活动的一九五一年十月十日法，名为裁减军备而实际上是使更进一步扩张军备合法化的提案，名为“保障和平的联合行动”、而实际上是加深联合国中的分裂和加强美国在其中的控制权的提案，正在讨论中的名为“集体措施”而实际上是进行新战争准备的计划的提案。
    这一切措施都是由美国的世界霸权“理想”促成的，它们都是美国外交政策的同一侵略方针的延续，美国统治集团仍然死死抱住这个方针，无论如何也不打算放弃。关于这方面，我们觉得似乎必须稍稍谈一下本届联合国大会前半期会议工作的结果了。
    美国在联大已经一再遭到失败重整军备计划的困难不断增加
    美国的侵略集团正在努力把这种结果说成是有利于他们的，他们几乎要说这是他们的一系列的胜利。可是这种所谓的“胜利”是“惨胜”。例如，虽然美国代表团使用了一切可能使用的压迫和恐吓手段，拚命要使希腊代替有一切合法权利当选的白俄罗斯加入安全理事会，可是美国代表团所进行的这一切活动却显然遭受了道义和政治上的失败。好容易到第十九次表决的时候才非法地“选出”希腊来，这难道不是事实吗？在前十八次的表决中间，美国一次又一次地遭受了失败。连“纽约先驱论坛报”去年十二月二十三日的社论也不得不承认，美国代表在选举期间，悍然使用了可能使用的一切压力。美国在这种情况下所使用的方法，已经由瑞典
    “晨报”所刊载的一则消息透露出来了，这则消息说，瑞典曾经从美国驻斯德哥尔摩大使馆方面受到美国的正式谴责，因为瑞典竟然敢于在联合国表示自己的意见。这个报纸说：“大国用这种方法在关于联合国的问题上对小国使用压力，这是值得注意的……”
    在讨论规定拨款一亿美元以便在苏联和人民民主国家进行颠覆活动的一九五一年十月十日法的时候，美国的外交政策不是也遭到了失败吗？那时候美国代表团和给他们帮腔的各代表团，证明他们自己甚至丝毫不能够编造出一些花言巧语来解释这种前所未闻的破坏国际公法的基本原则和标准的法律，来解释美国政府这种严重地破坏一九三三年苏美协定的行为。在表决这个问题的时候，有代表着五亿七千一百多万人口的十一个国家的“非共产党政府”拒绝支持美国，这个表决的结果不也表明了美国的失败吗？连拉丁美洲国家也不是一致支持美国的，难道这不是事实吗？这样的事实，能够作为喧嚷什么“胜利”的根据吗？因此，并不是偶然的，比较清醒的美国报纸也不得不承认，第六届联合国大会开始休假时的气氛表明，美国在大会各委员会中的威望已经一落千丈了，又说，不仅在中东国家和几个亚洲国家的代表中间，而且甚至在西方阵营中间，都开始听到“异议者”的声音了。
    如果说，我们的会议在圣诞节休会时是在颇为沮丧的气氛中休会的，那末，说昨天复会时是处于一种更“沮丧的气氛”中也没有什么不可以，因此，我毫不怀疑，当我们的会议在将来总结整个第六届大会会议的成绩时，将更使人失望。
    同时，这个报纸请人注意美国政府的所谓“裁军”建议与同时向欧洲各国勒索大批师团的行为两者之间的明显矛盾。
    举例说，比利时对美国的这些要求及因此而引起的不可避免的增加军费感到十分惊慌，难道这不是事实吗？自由党报纸“现代报”几天以前发表了一篇文章，题目是“军费负担超过比利时所能担负的限度”。天主教工会的报纸“城市报”发表了比利时代表在哈里曼委员会的谈话，他说，比利时“已到达了极限”，并说，“比利时再也不能为了大西洋的团结而向它的邻人送礼了”。
    但是，尽管在实施重整军备计划方面困难不断增加，美国仍然在卤莽地沿着这条道路前进，并竭力想把大西洋集团主要成员国的政府拖着一道向前走，虽然这些国家中间有一些已供认它们再也不能担负这个军备运动的重担了。的确，这些国家的局势是不值得羡慕的。举个例子说，下面是英国——大西洋集团中美国的主要伙伴之一——政府首脑邱吉尔先生关于英国目前局势的谈话。大家都知道，圣诞节的赞美歌颂赞“天上的上帝、地上的平安与世人的幸福”。据说地上是有这种平安与幸福的。可是邱吉尔先生在圣诞节前发表的演说却说了不少关于英国局势的悲惨的话。
    邱吉尔把英国比喻为在错误的路线上以每小时六十哩的速率从山上往下行驶的火车。他说：“如果为了要停车而在轨道上建筑砖墙，那是没有用的……这样只会使砖墙被碰得粉碎，火车损毁，乘客伤亡。首先应做的事是装上制动器。”他说：财政大臣已经做了这件事，这火车已慢慢可以控制了，而且可以停下来了。然后机车必须倒装过来，沿着正确的路线上前进。
    我认为这篇演说是值得注意的。它提出了一些问题，虽然它提出的方式是比喻式的；这些问题需要某种解释，我希望我在这里能得到对于这些问题的解释。例如，错误的路线是指的什么呢？砖墙又是什么呢？如果建筑障碍物来阻止在错误的路线上行驶的火车，为什么所有的乘客一定会伤亡，火车本身一定会损毁呢？所有这些都是颇为含糊的，但是有一件事情是清楚的：英国这列火车正在错误的路线上行驶着，必须装上制动器来停止它，使它掉过头来以便再开始在正确的路线上前进。
