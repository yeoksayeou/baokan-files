The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Public Security has entered a mass-based confession and reporting climax, and has achieved significant victories.

Since the Central Public Security Ministry held its Party Congress in mid-November of last year, it has effectively launched a struggle against corruption and degeneration, extravagance and waste, and bureaucratism within and outside the Party. During this struggle, the masses were initially mobilized, exposing some instances of corruption, extravagance, and bureaucratic styles; and confirming that the focus of inspection should be on administrative, production, and labor reform supervision departments. This struggle laid the ideological foundation for further mobilizing the masses on a large scale and launching the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

On December 22nd of last year, Comrade Luo Ruiqing delivered a mobilization report at a conference of Party member cadres of the Central Public Security Ministry and the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau. After a week of document study and ideological preparation, Comrade Luo Ruiqing again conducted repeated and in-depth mobilization at an enlarged Party group meeting on January 2nd, and first made a profound self-criticism; from January 3rd to 6th, the General Office and each bureau conducted communication of these ideas, and the leaders of these units also made self-criticisms. Under the promotion of leading cadres at all levels taking the lead, the movement was launched vigorously on a large scale from top to bottom, from within the Party to outside the Party.

Now, a mighty and broad mass-based force within the Central Public Security Ministry to fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism has taken shape, and the movement has entered a climax of confession by corrupt elements and mass reporting. In each unit, everyone from the top leaders to the janitorial staff, drivers, and nannies has been drawn into the movement. Meetings are held until late at night every day, and some units the masses automatically request to hold meetings all night. At the meetings, the masses expose corrupt elements face to face, with passionate emotions, a tense atmosphere, and extremely strong firepower. Numerous instances of corruption, waste, and bureaucratism have been exposed at the meetings; major corruption offenders, or those with small amounts of corruption but serious nature (such as corruption of donations), have aroused great hatred among the masses. At an anti-corruption struggle meeting in the General Office, 135 people spoke on the spot, exposing 33 corrupt elements. When some corrupt elements confessed haltingly, attempting to cover up, the masses interrupted their speeches, raising questions and making accusations. Tang Bingxin, a deaf-mute worker in the worker class, also wrote a letter of accusation, asking someone to read it at the meeting. Tang Bingxin historically exposed the corruption crimes of Wang Zhenjie and Wang Zhen, corrupt elements who had worked with him, saying that they "tainted the honor of the public security organs and are not worthy of being Communist Party members!" and demanded that they be expelled from the Party. When the chairman of the meeting, according to everyone's request, announced the dismissal of Wang Zhenjie, a cunning and defiant corrupt element who refused to confess, applause and cheers swept through the meeting place like a storm, and everyone stood on their benches and shouted: "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Currently, under the influence and promotion of the climax of the movement, the situation is beginning to change in individual units where the movement started later and the masses were not fully mobilized. The state of uneven development of the movement will be quickly overcome.

In the past week of the movement, serious corruption and waste incidents have been discovered through inspection, confession, and reporting. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 133 corrupt elements, large and small, have confessed and been exposed. Among them, the Administrative Department alone has 84. As of now, the largest corruption case discovered is the timber case led by Song Degui, director of the Administrative Department, and Liu Yuze, deputy director. During the movement, criminals such as Song and Liu were still engaged in small organizational activities, threatening informants and plotting resistance. Based on the reports and requests of the masses, and with the approval of higher authorities, the Central Public Security Ministry has dismissed and arrested Song Degui and Liu Yuze.

The experience of the Central Public Security Ministry proves that in order to thoroughly carry out the struggle against corruption and waste, and against bureaucratism, it is necessary to fully achieve the combination of leadership and the masses. In all the units that have done a good job, the leaders are determined, have the correct attitude, conduct self-criticism first, and bathe themselves first; moreover, this self-criticism is sincere and profound, not superficial or perfunctory. The responsible persons of these units dare to let go and mobilize the masses, dare to develop democracy, and they have followed Chairman Mao's instructions to be grandiose and vigorous. In all the units where the movement is not doing well, the leaders lack courageous and profound self-criticism, dare not "take off their pants" in front of the masses, and cannot stand in the movement to lead the masses. Therefore, they cannot distinguish the boundaries between corruption, waste, and bureaucratism; as a result, the enthusiasm of the masses is suppressed, and corrupt elements still have illusions, attempting to take chances or shift the target; the confession movement and the reporting movement cannot be launched. In these units, it is either because leading cadres suppress democracy, or because the masses do not receive correct leadership, causing some chaos. The leaders of these units should immediately change their wrong practices and conduct in-depth and thorough self-criticism in order to lead the mass struggle; otherwise, they will be subject to the punishment they deserve.

    中央公安部反贪污反浪费斗争猛烈展开
    逮捕大贪污犯宋德贵刘玉泽等
    群众性的检举坦白运动已进入高潮
    中央人民政府公安部的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动，已进入群众性的坦白和检举的高潮，并已获得重大胜利。
    中央公安部自去年十一月中旬，开过党代表大会以后，实际上即在党内和党外展开了反对贪污蜕化、反对铺张浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争。在这次斗争中，群众已有了初步发动，揭发了若干贪污腐化、铺张浪费现象和官僚主义作风；并肯定了检查的重点，应是行政、生产、劳动改造监管等部门。这次斗争，为大张旗鼓地进一步发动群众，展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，打下了思想基础。
    去年十二月二十二日，罗瑞卿同志在中央公安部、北京市公安局党员干部大会上作了动员报告，经过一周的文件学习和思想酝酿，罗瑞卿同志又在一月二日的党组扩大会议上，反复、深入地进行动员，并首先作了深刻的自我批评；从一月三日到六日三天中，办公厅和各局分别进行了传达，这些单位的领导人也进行了自我批评。在各级负责干部层层带头的推动下，运动遂即自上而下地从党内到党外地大规模地猛烈展开。
    现在，中央公安部中同贪污、浪费、官僚主义作斗争的一支声势浩大的、广大群众性的队伍已经形成，运动已进入贪污分子坦白和群众性检举的高潮。各个单位，自首长到勤杂人员以至司机、褓姆，全部卷入了运动，每天开会开到大半夜，有的单位群众自动要求通宵开会。会上，群众面对面地检举贪污分子，情绪激奋，空气紧张，火力十分强烈。贪污、浪费、官僚主义现象，在会上被大量揭发了；大贪污犯或贪污数目虽然不大但性质严重（如贪污捐献款项）的贪污分子，都激起了群众的极大憎恨。办公厅一次反贪污斗争大会上，当场有一百三十五人发言，检举出贪污分子三十三名。有些贪污分子坦白时吞吞吐吐，企图掩饰，群众就打断他的发言，纷纷提出质问和检举。工友班有一哑叭工友唐炳新，也写了检举书，请人在会上念了。唐炳新从历史上揭露了曾和他一起工作过的贪污分子王振杰、王珍的贪污罪行，说他们“沾污了公安机关的荣誉，不配当共产党员！”要求开除他们的党籍。当大会主席根据大家要求，宣布撤消狡猾抵赖、拒不坦白的贪污分子王振杰的职务时，鼓掌声、欢呼声像风暴一样席卷会场，大家站到凳子上高呼：“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”目前，在运动高潮的影响推动下个别运动起来较晚、群众发动不够充分的单位，情况也在开始转变。运动发展的不平衡状态，即将被迅速克服。
    一周来的运动中，经过检查坦白和检举，发现了严重的贪污浪费事件。据不完全统计，已坦白和检举出的大小贪污分子共一百三十三名。其中行政处即有八十四名。截至目前为止，发现的最大贪污案件，是以行政处处长宋德贵、副处长刘玉泽为首的木材案件。宋、刘等罪犯在运动中，仍进行小组织活动，威吓检举人，阴谋反抗，根据群众的检举和要求，经过上级批准，中央公安部已将宋德贵、刘玉泽撤职，并予以逮捕。
    中央公安部的经验证明，要把反对贪污浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争进行彻底，就必须完全做到领导与群众相结合。凡是搞得好的单位，都是领导人有决心，态度正确，先进行自我批评，先给自己洗澡，而且这种自我批评，是诚恳的、深刻的，不是肤浅的、敷衍塞责的。这些单位的负责人，敢于放手发动群众，放手发扬民主，他们按照毛主席的指示，做到了大张旗鼓、雷厉风行。凡是运动搞得不好的单位，都是领导人缺乏勇敢的、深刻的自我批评，不敢在群众面前“脱裤子”，不能站到运动之中领导群众，因此，他们就分不清贪污、浪费、官僚主义的界限；结果群众的热情受到压抑，贪污分子尚存有幻想，企图侥幸或转移目标；坦白运动、检举运动都搞不起来。在这些单位中，不是因为领导干部压制民主，就是因为群众得不到正确领导，搞得有些乱。这些单位的领导人，应该立即改变自己的错误作法，深入地彻底地进行自我批评，才能领导群众斗争，否则，他们就要受到应得的处分。
