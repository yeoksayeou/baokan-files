    Shenyang City Decides on Six Concrete Measures
    Resolutely Sanction Unscrupulous Merchants Sabotaging the Movement
    The Shenyang Municipal People's Government Committee and the Municipal Consultative Committee held a joint meeting on the 21st, adopting six concrete measures to resolutely sanction unscrupulous merchants who sabotage the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-theft movement.
    In the past four months, during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement launched within the Shenyang Municipal Government organs, a preliminary estimate shows that 17,225 households of unscrupulous merchants have been exposed and reported for illegal activities such as bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property. The losses to the state caused by these illegal activities are estimated to be at least 200 billion yuan. However, up to now, only over 2,000 oral or written confessions have been submitted by industrialists and businessmen, many of which are either downplaying their offenses or only talking about the past and not the present. Moreover, some industrialists and businessmen are attempting to obstruct, resist, and sabotage the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-profiteering, and anti-theft movement by means of threats, inducements, business closures, layoffs, early settlement of accounts, forming "defense alliances," extending the Spring Festival holiday, and the escape of key responsible persons. Some capitalists are even taking advantage of the approaching Spring Festival to dismiss workers with large sums of money, attempting to disperse the forces of struggle and adopt delaying tactics to get through the "checkpoint."
    Such illegal activities by unscrupulous merchants not only obstruct the progress of the movement but also hinder production and affect the people's lives. Therefore, the Shenyang Municipal People's Government has formulated six concrete measures to defeat the frantic counterattack of the capitalists and ensure the rapid and victorious development of the movement. These six measures were unanimously adopted by the joint meeting of the Municipal People's Government Committee and the Municipal Consultative Committee. The six concrete measures are as follows:
    1.  Members of the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and directors and supervisors of various trade associations should earnestly take responsibility. Those among them who have engaged in illegal activities such as bribery, tax evasion, profiteering, and theft of state property should first thoroughly confess and mutually report those who refuse to confess. Only in this way can they have the qualifications and courage to promote the participation of their fellow traders in the confession and reporting movement. The "Reception Rooms" and "Confession Stations" originally set up by the Federation of Industry and Commerce and various trade associations should be abolished. All industrialists and businessmen should directly confess to the government and submit written confessions.
        2.  During the movement, no industry is allowed to close down, lay off employees, settle accounts early, threaten or induce workers, shop assistants, accountants, out-counter staff, and bribe-takers within organs and enterprises, or enter into any "defense alliance" agreements with these personnel. Violators of the above provisions will be charged with sabotaging the movement.
    3.  Any private announcements of closure or disguised closure, layoffs or disguised layoffs, early settlement of accounts or disguised early settlement of accounts are illegal and invalid. All expenses already paid, such as travel expenses, wages, severance pay, and dismissal fees, must not be recovered. Workers, shop assistants, and staff members shall be paid their wages as usual after returning to work and shall not be deducted under any pretext or in any disguised form.
    4.  Managers, deputy managers, and other key responsible persons of all private factories and shops are not allowed to take leave to leave their enterprises during the movement period (including going home for the Spring Festival); exceptions will be made for those who thoroughly confess and guarantee that there are no other illegal activities.
    5.  In order to guarantee the right of workers, shop assistants, and staff members to report, to fully mobilize their enthusiasm, and to encourage them to participate in reporting bravely and without hesitation, the following two provisions are specifically stipulated: A. In view of the fact that in the past, in order to facilitate their illegal activities such as bribery, profiteering, and theft, capitalists often used petty favors to win over workers, shop assistants, and staff members (such as "profit sharing," "shareholding," "extra allowances," "more dividends," etc.), as long as they actively report the illegal activities of the capitalists, the government guarantees that all these benefits already belonging to the workers, shop assistants, and staff members will belong to the workers, shop assistants, and staff members, and will not be subject to any investigation or punishment; B. The government guarantees the right to work for workers, shop assistants, and staff members who bravely report. If the enterprise being reported is subject to penalties and individual closures, the government guarantees to introduce the workers, shop assistants, and staff members within the enterprise to work, that is to say, workers, shop assistants, and staff members will never lose their jobs because of participating in the reporting.
    6.  In order not to allow unscrupulous merchants to use the Spring Festival to delay or sabotage the vigorous development of the movement, and also to establish a new atmosphere in the industrial and commercial circles and change old malpractices, the government stipulates that after the Spring Festival, all industries in the city must start business and work on February 1st (the sixth day of the first lunar month) and must not delay under any pretext.

    沈阳市决定六项具体措施
    坚决制裁破坏运动的奸商
    沈阳市人民政府委员会和市协商委员会二十一日举行联席会议，通过六项具体措施，坚决制裁破坏反行贿、反偷漏、反盗窃运动的不法奸商。
    过去四个月，在沈阳市政府机关内部展开的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，被揭发、检举出来有行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财等非法行为的奸商，据初步统计就有一万七千二百二十五户；他们这些非法行为所造成的国家的损失，最低估计有两千亿元左右。但是，到现在为止，工商业者所提出的口头或书面的坦白材料还只有两千多件，其中许多是避重就轻，或是只说过去不说现在的。更有若干工商业者竟用威胁、利诱、歇业、解雇、提前结账、互订“攻守同盟”、延长春节假期、主要负责人逃避等办法，企图阻挠、抗拒、破坏反行贿、反偷漏、反暴利、反盗窃运动。还有一些资本家，利用春节将到的机会，以巨款遣散工人，企图分散斗争力量，采取拖延的方法过“关”。
    奸商的这种非法行为，不仅阻挠运动的进行，并且将妨碍生产，影响人民的生活，因此，沈阳市人民政府特拟具六项具体措施，以击退资本家的疯狂反攻，保证运动迅速胜利展开。这六项措施经市人民政府委员会和市协商委员会联席会议一致通过。六项具体措施如下：
    一、沈阳市工商业联合会委员、各行业公会理监事，应认真地负起责任来。他们之中有行贿、偷漏、暴利、盗窃国家财产等非法行为的人，应首先彻底坦白，并互相检举那些拒不坦白的人，这样才有条件、有勇气去推动他所领导的同业参加坦白、检举运动。工商业联合会及各行业公会原来设置的“接待室”、“坦白站”一律撤销。所有工商业者应该直接向政府坦白，递交坦白书。
        二、在运动期内，任何行业不准歇业，不准解雇，不准提前结账，不准威胁、利诱工人、店员、会计、外柜及机关、企业内部的受贿人员，不准与这些人员订什么“攻守同盟”之类的条约。违犯上述规定者，以破坏运动论罪。
    三、凡已私自宣布歇业或变相歇业，解雇或变相解雇，提前结账或变相提前结账者，都是非法的，一律无效。凡已付出的路费、工资、解雇金、遣散费等，一律不得收回。工人、店员、职员复业后，工资照给，不得借故或变相扣除。
    四、各私营工厂、商店的经理、副经理及其他负主要责任的人，在运动期内一律不准请假离开本企业（回家过春节也不准）；但如彻底坦白并具结保证再无其他非法行为者例外。
    五、为了保证工人、店员、职员的检举权，以充分发挥他们的积极性，勇敢地、毫无顾虑地参加检举，特规定下列两条：甲、鉴于过去资方为了便于达到自己行贿、暴利、盗窃等非法行为的目的，常以小恩小惠施之于工人、店员、职员（如“分肥”、“入股份”、“额外津贴”、“多分红利”等等），只要他们积极检举资方的非法行为，政府保证这些已归工人、店员、职员的利益，一律归工人、店员、职员所有，亦不加以任何追究与处分；乙、勇敢检举的工人、店员、职员，政府保证他们的工作权，如被检举的企业因受处罚而有个别停业者，政府保证介绍该企业内的工人、店员、职员以工作，就是说，决不让工人、店员、职员因参加检举而失业。
    六、为了不让奸商利用春节拖延或破坏运动的饱满开展，也为了树立工商界的新风气，改变旧陋规，政府规定：春节过后，全市各行业一律要在二月一日（旧历正月初六）开市、开工，不得借故拖延。
