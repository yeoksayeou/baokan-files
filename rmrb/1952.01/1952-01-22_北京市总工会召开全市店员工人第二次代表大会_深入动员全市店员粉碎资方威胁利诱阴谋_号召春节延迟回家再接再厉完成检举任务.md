Xinhua News Agency, January 21st—The Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened the Second Representative Assembly of Citywide Shop Employees on January 21st. The assembly summarized the work since the First Representative Assembly, calling on citywide shop employees to make persistent efforts, deeply mobilize, continue to bravely expose, and resolutely fight to the end against illegal activities by the bourgeoisie.

Since the First Representative Assembly on the 15th of this month, trade unions in various districts have held shop employee meetings by industry, conveying the spirit of the Municipal Shop Employee Representative Assembly. This broke down the shop employees' concerns such as "fear of unemployment," "consideration for personal relationships," "fear of dismissal," "fear of retaliation," and "fear of being implicated." They actively participated in the struggle to expose illegal merchants. According to incomplete statistics, as of the 20th, shop employees citywide had exposed more than 7,000 cases of illegal activities such as bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, and illegal profiteering. During this struggle, illegal capitalists attempted to sabotage through shameless means such as threats and enticements, but these conspiracies were relentlessly exposed by the shop employees. For example, the owner of Hanwen Pavilion in the First District threatened the shop employees, saying, "You must not talk about the affairs of the counter, if you do, the shop will collapse, and you will get nothing." At the same time, he gave each shop employee a year's salary as a year-end "gift" and promised to increase wages by 50% from this year. However, the workers saw through the capitalist's conspiracy of threats and enticements and resolutely exposed the capitalist's tax evasion and bribery. The owner of Zengshun Salt, Oil, and Grain Store in the Ninth District also gave the workers five months' salary as a year-end "gift" and doubled their wages. However, the shop employees replied: Everyone should act in accordance with policy, and wages should be increased if they are supposed to be. We must expose what we should expose. Some accountants and outside runners, who had been courted by the capitalists in the past and had done bad things under the capitalists' instructions, also raised their awareness in this movement and bravely exposed the capitalists' illegal activities. For example, the accountant of Wenji Stationery Store, on the way back after the First Representative Assembly, discussed with Liang Youkun, the outside runner, and exposed the capitalist's tax evasion. Zhang Changbo, the outside runner of Hengfengyuan Hardware Store, used to help capitalists bribe officials. He was originally afraid of implicating himself, but after the Representative Assembly, he dispelled his concerns and exposed more than 70 illegal activities by the capitalist.

The Second Representative Assembly mainly discussed how to deeply mobilize the masses on the basis of existing achievements, continue to make persistent efforts to carry out the exposure, expose the destructive activities of illegal capitalists, and carry out the struggle to the end.

The assembly began with a speech by Liu Laifu, vice chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. After summarizing the achievements of the past week, he pointed out that some illegal merchants are now carrying out various conspiracies to undermine our struggle. He said: It should be particularly pointed out that some illegal merchants are trying to take advantage of the opportunity of workers returning home for the Spring Festival to muddle through this struggle. Therefore, he called on shop employees to voluntarily delay their return home, stand firm, complete the task of exposing, and fight to the end against the illegal activities of the bourgeoisie, and then return home for a reunion after a comprehensive victory. Subsequently, shop employee representatives Yang Zhiquan and Duan Yurong spoke. They introduced their experiences in carrying out unyielding struggles with illegal merchants. In her report, Duan Yurong reported how she overcame her incorrect thoughts and exposed her father's criminal act of shielding merchants from tax evasion. Yang Zhiquan reported his experience in standing firm on the position of the working class and resolutely exposing his aunt's husband. After the representatives spoke, the deputy directors of the First and Tenth District Trade Union Offices reported on the situation and experience of mobilizing the struggle in their districts.

These reports were very encouraging to everyone. Exposures were launched on the spot at the meeting, and the representatives exposed a total of 515 cases of illegal activities by unscrupulous merchants. At the same time, the Food Industry Trade Union of the Tenth District and the Stationery Industry Trade Union of the Fifth District challenged the representatives of various districts on the spot, mobilizing shop employees not to go home for the Spring Festival and resolutely continue to fight to the end against the illegal activities of the bourgeoisie. This challenge was immediately warmly responded to by everyone, and 46 challenge response letters were received at that time.

The assembly was summarized by Liu Laifu. He said: Our meeting is like arranging a charge on the battlefield, and we must further achieve greater victory. He called on everyone to convey the spirit of the Representative Assembly to every shop employee, carry out the struggle to the end, and achieve a comprehensive victory. He said: If unscrupulous merchants do not honestly confess, they will not be able to escape the exposure of the working class.

The assembly finally passed a telegram to all shop employees in Tianjin, demanding that the government severely punish the unscrupulous merchants Jia Shoushan and Zhao Shaozhen who forced shop employees participating in the anti-bribery struggle to death.

    北京市总工会召开全市店员工人第二次代表大会
    深入动员全市店员粉碎资方威胁利诱阴谋
    号召春节延迟回家再接再厉完成检举任务
    【新华社二十一日讯】北京市总工会二十一日召开全市店员工人第二次代表大会，总结第一次代表大会以来的工作，号召全市店员工人再接再厉，深入动员，继续勇敢检举，和资产阶级不法行为坚决斗争到底。
    在本月十五日第一次代表大会以后，各区工会都按行业举行店员大会，传达市店员工人代表大会的精神，打破了店员们“怕失业”“顾情面”“怕解雇”“怕报复”和“怕受连累”等顾虑，他们纷纷参加检举不法商人的斗争。据不完全的统计，到二十日止，全市店员检举出来的行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家财产、非法攫取暴利等不法行为共有七千多件。在这一斗争过程中，不法资方曾企图使用威胁利诱等无耻手段来进行破坏，但这些阴谋都被店员们无情地揭发。如像一区汉文阁老板曾一面威胁店员说：“柜上的事你们可千万别说，说了铺子垮台你们也没好处”；一面又给每个店员发了一年的工资，作为年终“馈送”，并答应从今年起增加百分之五十的工资。但工人们看透了资方威胁利诱的阴谋，仍然坚决地检举了资方偷税、行贿的行为。九区增顺盐油粮店的老板也给工人发了五个月工资的年终“馈送”，并增加了一倍工资。但店员工人回答说：大家按政策办事，该增加工资就得增加，我们该检举就一定要检举。有一部分会计和跑外人员，过去受资方拉拢，并在资方的指使下做过坏事，在这次运动中也提高了觉悟，勇敢地检举了资方的非法行为。如文记文具行会计在第一次代表大会开完会回去的路上，就和跑外的梁佑坤商量检举了资方的偷税行为。恒丰源五金行跑外的张长波过去帮助资本家行贿，原怕连累自己，在代表大会以后解除了顾虑，检举了资方七十多件不法行为。
    第二次代表大会主要是讨论如何在现有成绩的基础上深入动员群众，再接再厉开展检举，揭破不法资方的破坏行为，把斗争贯彻到底。
    大会首由市总工会副主席刘莱夫讲话。他在概括地总结了一周来的成绩后指出：一部分不法商人现在正进行各种阴谋活动破坏我们的斗争。他说：特别应当指出的是有些不法商人正企图利用春节工人回家过年的机会，来混过这一斗争。因此，他号召店员工人自愿延迟回家，站稳立场，完成检举任务，和资产阶级的不法行为斗争到底，等到获得全面的胜利后再回家团圆。接着，店员代表杨志铨、段玉蓉等发言。他们介绍了自己和不法商人进行不屈不挠斗争的经过。段玉蓉在报告中，报告了她怎样战胜了她的不正确思想，检举了她父亲包庇商人偷税的犯法行为。杨志铨报告了他站稳工人阶级立场、坚决检举他姨夫的经过。在代表们发言以后，一、十两区工会办事处副主任报告了他们区里发动斗争的情况和经验。
    这些报告对大家的鼓舞很大，当时在会场里就展开了检举，代表们一共检举了五百一十五件奸商不法行为。同时，十区食品业工会、五区文具业工会当场向各区代表提出挑战，动员店员春节不回家，坚决继续和资产阶级的不法行为斗争到底。这一挑战立刻获得大家的热烈响应，当时即收到四十六件挑战应战书。
    大会由刘莱夫作总结。他说：我们这个大会好比在战场上布置一次冲锋，我们要再进一步取得更大胜利。他号召大家把代表大会的精神传达给每个店员，把斗争进行到底，取得全面胜利。他说：不法奸商如果不老老实实地坦白，他们是逃不出工人阶级的检举的。
    大会最后通过了致天津全体店员工人的电报，要求政府严惩逼死参加反行贿斗争的店员的奸商贾寿山和赵绍珍。
