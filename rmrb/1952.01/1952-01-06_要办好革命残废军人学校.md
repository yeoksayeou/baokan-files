    It is Necessary to Run Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Schools Well
    Xie Juezai
    Comrades who inspected the Zhuozhou Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School said:
    The Zhuozhou Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School has 538 students, all of whom are second-class B or lower disabled, with third-class disabled accounting for 95%. The students are divided into five teams and nine classes, according to their educational level, and teaching is conducted on a class basis, using accelerated methods to complete a year's course in one semester. The students have a high enthusiasm for learning and are progressing very quickly. They are very satisfied with the government's establishment of the school for them. There are 21 teachers, and the students love the teachers very much. Because of the students' progress, the teachers are very moved and say, "Revolutionary soldiers are truly great, and their learning progress is even faster than that of workers and peasants."
    We should examine our concept of revolutionary disabled soldiers. We have formulated preferential treatment and pensions regulations for revolutionary disabled soldiers, which is important and must be done well. But another aspect of revolutionary disabled soldiers is that they have a high level of political consciousness, are tempered by revolutionary war, have intelligent minds, and are still very young. For them, it is not just a matter of "supporting" and "employing," but especially a matter of "teaching" and "improving." They are heroes on the national defense front, and they should also be heroes on all fronts of production and construction, cultural construction, and political power construction. We have not paid enough attention to this point.
    Revolutionary disabled soldiers schools should be run as regular schools. Equip them with sufficient and qualified teachers, sufficient learning funds, and approve suitable courses to cultivate a group of national construction talents from there.
    The provincial and regional people's governments that have established revolutionary disabled soldiers schools must attach importance to this work. The civil affairs departments and education departments should provide concrete leadership with an active spirit, so that the talents and patriotic aspirations of revolutionary disabled soldiers can be further developed. This is also very much in line with the requirements of national construction.

    要办好革命残废军人学校
    谢觉哉
    视察涿县革命残废军人学校的同志说：
    涿县革命残废军人学校学员五百三十八人，均为二等乙级以下残废，三等残废占百分之九十五。学员编为五个队、九个班，按文化程度分班，教学以班为单位，采速成方法，以一学期完成一年课程。学员学习情绪很高，进步极快。对于政府给他们办学校，非常满意。教员二十一人，学员对教员很爱戴，因为学员的进步，教师们很感动，说：“革命军人真伟大，他们的学习进步比工农干部还快。”
    应该检讨一下我们对革命残废军人的概念。我们对革命残废军人，制定了优待抚恤条例，这是重要的，必须办好的。但对于革命残废军人的另一面：他们有高度的政治觉悟，有革命战争的锻炼，有聪敏的头脑，而且都还很年青。对于他们不止是“养”和“就业”的问题，而尤其是“教”和
    “提高”的问题。他们是国防战线上的英雄，同样也应是生产建设、文化建设、政权建设各个战线上的英雄。这一点，我们的注意是不够的。
    要把革命残废军人学校当作正规学校办。配备足够质量够格的教员、有足够的学习经费、审定适合的课程、从那里培养出一批国家的建设人才来。
    凡设有革命残废军人学校的省区人民政府，须重视这一工作，民政部门和教育部门应以积极的精神作具体的领导，使革命残废军人的才能与爱国志愿得到更大的发扬。这也很符合于国家建设的要求的。
