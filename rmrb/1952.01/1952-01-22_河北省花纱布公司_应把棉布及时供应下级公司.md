    Hebei Provincial Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company
    Should Supply Cotton Cloth to Subordinate Companies Promptly

    To the Editor:
    Due to last year's bumper cotton harvest, the purchasing power of cotton farmers has greatly increased. Since the beginning of winter, the sales of cotton cloth in the Handan town market, Hebei Province, have gradually increased. According to the current situation, the daily sales are at least seven or eight hundred bolts, and sometimes as many as one thousand bolts.

    However, the Hebei Provincial Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company has a bureaucratic work style and fails to allocate cotton cloth in a timely manner. This prevents the Handan Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Branch Company from adequately supplying the market, and it is now approaching a state of stockout. According to current statistics, the Handan Branch Company's current cotton cloth inventory is only one-third of what it had before the autumn. Although the branch company has repeatedly requested the provincial company to allocate cloth, the problem has not been resolved. Although the provincial company approved the Handan Branch Company's cloth sales plan for January 1952, the cloth was not allocated in a timely manner. Although a batch of cloth arrived in the first ten days of the month, the amount of colored cloth was very small, far from meeting the needs of the people.

    Now that the Spring Festival is approaching, it is the peak season for cotton cloth transactions. Whether the supply of cotton cloth is sufficient or not has a great impact on stabilizing prices. I suggest that the Hebei Provincial Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company pay attention to this matter and take effective measures promptly.

### 河北省花纱布公司  应把棉布及时供应下级公司

    河北省花纱布公司
    应把棉布及时供应下级公司
    编辑同志：由于去年棉花丰收，棉农购买力大大提高，入冬以来河北省邯郸镇市场棉布销量逐渐增多。以目前情况看，每天少者销七八百匹，多者销一千匹。
    但是，河北省花纱布公司有官僚主义作风，下拨棉布不及时，就使得邯郸花纱布分公司不能充分供应市场，并已接近脱销状态。据现在统计，邯郸分公司现存棉布数字只占秋前所存三分之一，后虽屡次向省公司提出拨布意见，但始终没有得到解决。一九五二年一月份邯郸分公司销布计划虽经省公司批准，但也没有及时下拨。上旬虽然来了一批布，但色布为数甚少，远远不能满足群众需要。
    现在春节快要到了，正是棉布交易畅旺季节，棉布供应充足不充足，对稳定物价有着很大关系，我建议河北省花纱布公司对这件事要注意起来，并速作有效措施。　任鹤仪
