The great victory of rebuilding Warsaw

    January 17th is the seventh anniversary of the liberation of Warsaw by the Soviet army. On January 17th seven years ago, when the Red Army entered Warsaw, the city was desolate, with ruins everywhere. The once prosperous streets and squares had become no-man's-lands. But the Polish people did not succumb to these difficulties. The Hitler bandits vainly attempted to destroy Warsaw, but the Polish people and government were determined to rebuild it and make it even more beautiful. Thus, President Bierut's slogan of "The whole nation unites to build the motherland's capital" became the goal of the whole nation's united action.
    After seven years of construction, today we see a new city. The city's streets have been restored and expanded, new and beautiful "East-West Avenues" have been opened, and the Marunstadt Bridge has been built. New factories have successively started operations: the country's first automobile factory in Zheran, a motorcycle factory, a large-scale radio factory, and many other enterprises of national scale.
    Currently, more than 40 large industrial enterprises and 15 residential areas are under construction in Warsaw. For example, the Molanov residential area, which is prepared to accommodate 60,000 people, and the Marshakowska residential area, which will accommodate 45,000 people.
    In addition to enterprises and residences, new higher specialized school buildings, middle school buildings, theaters, sanatoriums, hospitals, and nurseries are also being built. All of this was impossible to imagine seven years ago, but now it has been realized or is being realized.
    Now, the Polish people's work of building the capital Warsaw has entered its eighth year.

    复兴华沙城的巨大胜利
    一月十七日是苏联军队解放华沙城的七周年纪念日。七年前的一月十七日，当红军进入华沙时，华沙城满目凄凉，到处是废墟，昔日繁华的街道和广场都成了无人地带。但是波兰人民并没有在这种困难面前低头。希特勒匪徒妄想毁灭华沙，可是波兰人民和政府却一定要把它重新建设起来，使它更加美丽。这样，贝鲁特总统提出的“全国人民一起建设祖国的首都”的口号便成了全国人民一致行动的目标了。
    经过了七年的建设，今天我们看到了新的城市。城市的街道恢复并扩展了，增辟了新的漂亮的“东西大道”，建筑了马润斯塔特桥。新的工厂相继开工：在热兰的全国第一个汽车制造工厂、机器脚踏车工厂、规模庞大的无线电工厂以及许多其他具有全国规模的企业。
    目前，在华沙城有四十多个巨大的工业企业和十五个住宅区正在建筑中。例如准备居住六万人的莫拉诺夫住宅区，及将要居住四万五千人的马沙阔夫斯卡住宅区等。
    除去企业和住宅以外，新的高等专门学校的建筑物、中学的校舍、剧院、疗养院、医院以及托儿所等建筑物也正在建造中。这一切，在七年以前都是不可能想像的事，但现在都实现了或正在实现中。
    现在，波兰人民建设首都华沙的工作，已经进入第八年。
