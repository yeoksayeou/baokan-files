    Waste Dry Batteries Should Be Fully Utilized
    Editor: Fully utilizing waste materials is an important method of practicing thrift. Many people throw away waste dry batteries, which is a waste.
    Let us do some calculations: Suppose a county has ten telephone sets and ten radios, each using one A battery every two months, calculated at 30,000 yuan per battery, then 300,000 yuan is needed each month. If they utilize waste batteries, each battery can be used for one month, and one month's battery cost can be saved every three months, that is, 300,000 yuan; if the whole country is calculated based on 2,000 counties, 600 million yuan can be saved in three months, and 2.4 billion yuan can be saved in one year. This is just the calculation for A batteries. If we also calculate the more expensive B batteries and the commonly used flashlight batteries, the amount will be even more astonishing. In order to build our motherland and support the Chinese People's Volunteers, I suggest that we should make full use of waste dry batteries as much as possible.　Wu Jinming

    应该充分加以利用废干电池
    编辑同志：充分利用废物，是厉行节约的重要方法之一。很多人把废干电池丢掉，这是一种浪费。
    我们且算一算账看：假定一个县有十部电话机和十部收音机，每部两个月用一筒A电，按每筒三万元计算，每月就需三十万元。他们如果利用废电池，每筒可利用一个月，每三个月可节省出一个月的电池费用，即三十万元；全国若按二千个县计算，三个月就可节约六亿元，一年可节约二十四亿元。这还只是A电一项的计算，如把价值较贵的B电和普遍使用的手灯电池再算计一下，数目就更惊人了。为了建设我们的祖国和支持中国人民志愿军，我建议应尽量利用废干电池。　吴金铭
