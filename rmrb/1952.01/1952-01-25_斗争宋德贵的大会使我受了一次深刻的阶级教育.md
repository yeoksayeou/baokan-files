    The Struggle Session Against Song Degui Provided Me With a Profound Class Education
    Comrade Editor: On January 16th, I participated in the rally held by the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government to denounce the major embezzlers Song Degui, Liu Yuze, and others. I received a profound class education.
    
    At this meeting, I thought about myself. I have not been participating in the revolution for long, and my petty-bourgeois thoughts have not been completely reformed. I was not alert to the corrosion and influence of the bourgeoisie. My mind has been poisoned by the bourgeoisie, and I have begun to pursue vanity and enjoyment. Not only do I not despise the bourgeois lifestyle, but I also admire them. This great movement gave me a vaccination, increasing my resistance. I am determined to take a good bath in this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, draw a clear line between myself and the bourgeoisie ideologically, and earnestly transform and improve myself.

    斗争宋德贵的大会使我受了一次深刻的阶级教育
    编辑同志：一月十六日我参加了中央人民政府公安部举行的斗争大贪污犯宋德贵、刘玉泽等的大会。我受了一次深刻的阶级教育。
    在这个大会上，我联想到我自己。我参加革命的时间不长，我的小资产阶级的思想还没有彻底地改造。对资产阶级的腐蚀和影响，我是没有警惕的。我的思想已经中了资产阶级的毒，开始追求虚荣、享受。我不但不鄙视资产阶级的生活方式，反而羡慕他们。这次伟大的运动给我打了防疫针，增加了我的抵抗力。我决心在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中好好地洗一个澡，从思想上和资产阶级划清界限，认真地改造自己，提高自己。
