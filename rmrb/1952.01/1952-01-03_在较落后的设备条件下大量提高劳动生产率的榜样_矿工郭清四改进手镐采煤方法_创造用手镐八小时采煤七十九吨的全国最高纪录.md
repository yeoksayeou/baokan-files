Worker Guo Qingsi of the Longhu Mine at the state-owned Pingxiang Coal Mine improved the hand pick mining method and, on November 30, 1951, created a national record of 79 tons of coal mined with a hand pick in one work shift (eight hours), setting an example for greatly increasing labor productivity under relatively backward equipment conditions. This new record is six times higher than the average efficiency of hand pick mining at the Pingxiang Coal Mine and 60 percent higher than the efficiency of pneumatic picks in medium-thick coal seams as stipulated by the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government.

Guo Qingsi's new record was created using the strip filling longwall mining method. The Pingxiang Coal Mine changed from the old pillar-and-stall mining method to the new longwall mining method in January 1951, but due to equipment limitations, pneumatic picks could not be used extensively, and most workers still used hand picks for mining. Over the past year, like hand pick mining methods in other coal mines, each worker was limited to a small area of ​​three meters long (commonly referred to as a "set of props") for mining. If the coal seam was relatively loose, a worker could mine two sets of props in one shift, but they still had to finish one set of props before moving on to the second set. Moreover, mining and propping work were not separated, so miners also had to do propping work. Under these circumstances, the efficiency of hand pick mining remained very low. In mid-October 1951, after the democratic reform movement achieved victory in the entire mine, the workers' political awareness increased, coupled with Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, their labor enthusiasm soared. The efficiency of pneumatic pick mining was continuously improved due to workers' continuous improvement of technology, but the efficiency of hand pick mining improved very slowly. At this time, Guo Qingsi was determined to improve his mining method. After repeated research and absorbing the experience of pneumatic pick mining, his improvement was finally successful. On November 30th, he mined coal on an inclined working face with a relatively loose coal seam. The working face was two meters high and thirty-six meters long. He changed the previous method of mining in a single set of props and, at the beginning, cut a groove across the entire working face at waist height from end A to end B, dividing the entire working face into two parts, so that the upper part of the coal seam was completely suspended. Then, he turned back and blasted the upper suspended coal seam from end A to end B. Then, he turned back again and started "lifting the bottom" (i.e., mining the lower part of the coal) from end A. At this time, two other workers cooperated with him to do propping work. As a result, Guo Qingsi completed the entire coal seam of twelve sets of props on the entire working face in one shift, mining a total of 79 tons of coal. In the same time and on the same coal seam, he used to be able to mine only eight or nine tons of coal from one or two sets of props, just like other ordinary hand pick miners in the mine. Subtracting the ordinary mining figure of 17 or 18 tons for the two propping workers from the 79 tons of coal mined by Guo Qingsi, Guo Qingsi's mining efficiency increased sixfold compared to the past.

The advantages of Guo Qingsi's mining method are: (1) Fully utilizing the pressure of the roof, saving manpower. When Guo Qingsi pulled the groove to end B and turned back, the upper suspended coal seam had been loosened by the pressure of the roof, making excavation very quick and effortless. (2) Eliminating the phenomenon of "waiting for work" and increasing labor time. In the past, because the mining site was only three meters long, coal haulers could not haul coal when miners were mining, and miners could not mine when coal haulers were hauling coal, waiting for each other, resulting in a large amount of "waiting for work." Now, because the length of the mining site has increased, there is plenty of room for maneuver, and miners and coal haulers do not interfere with each other, and the phenomenon of "waiting for work" is eliminated. (3) Utilizing the natural power of the inclined shape to increase the mining speed. Because the length of the mining site has increased, slotting and mining are carried out from the upper end of the inclination from top to bottom (i.e., from end A to end B as mentioned above), which is less laborious than before, and the mining speed is increased. (4) After the miners and propping workers divide their work, each is responsible for their own tasks, so the work efficiency is higher than before.

The success of Guo Qingsi's improved hand pick mining method and the emergence of his new record are of great significance in the current situation where the equipment conditions in many coal mines in our country are still relatively backward, and a large-scale campaign to increase production and practice economy is being launched. Guo Qingsi himself can mine more than 6,000 tons of coal in 1952 by working according to this improved working method (including the mining of the hardest coal seams), increasing production and practicing economy for the country, equivalent to the wealth of 355 tons of rice. If this method is promoted in his Pingxiang Coal Mine, it can generally increase the efficiency of hand pick mining in Pingxiang Coal Mine by two and a half times, and the cost of each ton of coal can also be reduced by 38 percent.

### 在较落后的设备条件下大量提高劳动生产率的榜样  矿工郭清四改进手镐采煤方法  创造用手镐八小时采煤七十九吨的全国最高纪录

    在较落后的设备条件下大量提高劳动生产率的榜样
    矿工郭清四改进手镐采煤方法
    创造用手镐八小时采煤七十九吨的全国最高纪录
    国营萍乡煤矿龙虎矿场工人郭清四改进了手镐采煤方法，在一九五一年十一月三十日创造了在一班工作时间内（八小时）采煤七十九吨的手镐采煤全国最高纪录，为在比较落后的设备条件下大量提高劳动生产率树立了榜样。这个新纪录比目前萍乡煤矿手镐采煤的普通效率提高六倍，比中央人民政府燃料工业部所规定的在中厚煤层中的风镐效率高百分之六十。
    郭清四的这个新纪录是在带状充填长壁式采煤方法下创造出来的。萍乡煤矿从一九五一年一月起就改旧的残柱式采煤法为新的长壁式采煤法，但由于设备条件的限制，未能大量使用风镐，大多数工人仍然用手镐采煤。一年来，和其他煤矿手镐采煤的方法一样，每个工人总是局限在三公尺长的狭小范围内
    （普通称一架棚子）采掘。如煤层较松，一个工人在一班内能采两架棚子的煤，但是还是要采完一架棚子的煤后，再到第二架棚子去采。而且，采煤工作和支柱工作也没有分开，所以采煤工人又要作支柱工作。在这种情形下，手镐采煤的效率仍然很低。一九五一年十月中旬，民主改革运动在全矿取得胜利后，工人的政治觉悟提高，加上毛主席提出增产节约的号召，他们的劳动热情就异常高涨。风镐采煤的效率，由于工人纷纷改进技术而不断地提高，但是手镐采煤的效率却提高得很缓慢。这时，郭清四就下决心改进自己的采煤方法。经过反覆地研究，并吸收了风镐采煤的经验。他的改进终于得到了成功，十一月三十日，他在煤层较松的一个倾斜形的工作面采煤。工作面高两公尺，长三十六公尺。他改变了从前单在一架棚子里采掘的办法，开始时就在工作面的腰部从甲端到乙端拉了一个横贯整个工作面的槽口，把整个工作面分裂为两部，使上半部煤层完全悬空。接着，他回头从甲端到乙端打掉上半部悬空的煤层，然后，他再回头从甲端开始“起底”（即采下半部的煤）。这时，其他两个工人便配合着他作支柱工作。结果，郭清四在一班工作时间内就把整个工作面十二架棚子的煤层全部采完，共采出煤七十九吨。在同样时间、同样煤层内，和矿内其他普通手镐采煤工人一样，从前他只能采出一架到两架棚子的煤八、九吨。以郭清四所采出的七十九吨煤内减去两个支柱工人的普通采煤数字十七八吨计算，郭清四的采煤效率比过去提高了六倍。
    郭清四所用的这种采煤方法的优点是：（1）充分地利用了顶板的压力，节省了人力。当郭清四拉槽口拉到乙端回头时，上半部悬空的煤层已被顶板的压力压松，挖掘起来就非常迅速、省力。（2）消灭了“窝工”现象，增加了劳动时间。从前，因采掘场所只有三公尺长，采煤时拖煤工人不能拖煤，拖煤时采煤工人不能采煤，互相等待，形成大量“窝工”现象。现在，由于采煤场所的长度增加，大有回旋余地，采煤工人和拖煤工人互不妨碍，“窝工”现象就消灭了。（3）利用了倾斜形的自然力量，提高了采掘速度。由于采煤场所的长度增加，拉槽、采掘都是从倾斜度的上端由上而下
    （即上述从甲端到乙端）进行，比从前省力，采掘速度就提高了。（4）采煤工人和支柱工人分工后，各负专责，所以工作效率比以前提高。
    郭清四改进手镐采煤方法的成功和他的新纪录的出现，在目前我国许多煤矿设备条件还比较落后，而又要展开大规模增产节约运动的情况下，具有重大意义。仅郭清四本人按照这个改进了的工作方法工作，一九五二年就可以多采出六千多吨煤（包括最硬煤层的采掘在内），为国家增产节约等于三百五十五吨大米的财富。这个方法如在他所在的萍乡煤矿推广，可以使萍乡煤矿手镐采煤效率普遍提高两倍半，每吨煤的成本也可以降低百分之三十八。
