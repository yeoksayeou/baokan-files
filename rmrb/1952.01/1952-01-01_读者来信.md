Reader's Letters

    Literary Workers Should Create Works Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucratism

    Comrade Editor: Currently, the entire country is vigorously carrying out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism. Our literary workers have a responsibility to create more literary works with this movement as their theme to educate the people of the whole country.

    I think the two cartoons published by Comrade Hua Junwu in the People's Daily have provided us with good examples. The first painting, "Greed Blinds the Mind" (published in the People's Daily on December 24, 1951), vividly portrays the dangers of the "sugar-coated bullets" of unscrupulous merchants. It gives a powerful education to certain cadres whose revolutionary stand is not firm. The second painting, "Secret Theft and Open Destruction" (published in the People's Daily on December 28, 1951), clearly reveals the harm of "corruption" and "waste" to state property, and criticizes the erroneous ideas and stealing behavior under the pretexts of "It doesn't matter if we waste a little," "We deserve enjoyment since we have worked hard even without merit," and "Seeking welfare for the small collective." These two paintings have played a certain role in criticizing erroneous ideas and promoting the progress of the movement.

    I hope that literary workers can target the various ideological situations of the masses in this movement, and use various literary forms to expose, criticize, or praise, so that the movement can be carried out more deeply.

    Congratulations to Writer Lao She on Winning the Honorary Title of "People's Artist"

    Comrade Editor: We were very excited to see the news in the newspaper that writer Lao She has won the honorary title of "People's Artist." We wholeheartedly support this correct measure of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. Lao She's play "Dragon Beard Ditch" specifically demonstrates the Beijing municipal construction's policy of serving the working people, and reflects the people's love for the People's Government. In terms of writing skills and the use of mass language, it has achieved good results. This play has been warmly welcomed by the working people. Recently, our Hebei Provincial Lutai Middle School also performed this play, which was praised by all the audience. We think that the Beijing Municipal People's Government's commendation of Lao She is very necessary. This shows that the People's Government highly respects the labor of writers. We congratulate Lao She on winning the award and hope that Lao She will continue to create more literary works needed by the people. We also hope that literary workers across the country can strive to meet the literary and artistic needs of the people.

    Learn from Gao Yubao, a Heroic Literary Warrior

    Comrade Editor: After reading the article "Gao Yubao, a Heroic Literary Warrior" published in the "Resist America, Aid Korea Special Issue" of the People's Daily on December 16, 1951, I was deeply moved by his firm writing perseverance. Gao Yubao only attended school for more than a month, and now he is able to write a novel of 300,000 words. Without the party's cultivation and education, the comrades' encouragement and help, and his own hard work, such an achievement would not have been possible. Gao Yubao is determined to tell all the class brothers in the country about the oppression he has suffered, so that they can "remember the evil enemy and hold their guns tighter"; he wants to let his father and younger brother distinguish between friends and enemies, firmly remember the hatred of the past, and work hard to build a new society. With this writing purpose, he generated a special force that prompted him to make up his mind: "If I can't write it in one year, I will write it in two years; if I can't write it in two years, I will write it in five years. I must write it out." What a precious quality and amazing perseverance! From this, I saw how much creativity and resilience the children of the working people have. I learned from this that only with writing feelings and writing purposes full of serving the people can we write good literary works. I usually like literary writing, but only start from my personal interests. This kind of writing attitude is extremely incorrect, and it is the biggest reason hindering my progress. I am determined to learn from Comrade Gao Yubao, correct my attitude towards literary writing, establish the writing purpose of serving the people, and strive to be a people's literary warrior.

    Hope That Literary Workers in Various Places Respond to the Rectification and Study Movement in Beijing's Literary and Art Circles

    Comrade Editor: After reading Bai Ren's novel "Bloody Battle on Tianmen Peak" in the fifth issue of the third volume of "People's Literature," I mistakenly thought that the method of implementing "pretend surrender" by "using a trick" was very good. Not only did I read it myself, but I also enthusiastically recommended this work to others. This shows that I was completely captured by Bai Ren's erroneous thoughts. With this wrong understanding, I had such a contradiction when reading the book "Shangrao Concentration Camp"; on the one hand, I was moved by the heroes' tenacious and unyielding spirit and admired their noble revolutionary qualities and integrity, on the other hand, I felt that they did not understand "tactics." I thought: Since the secret agents wanted them to "repent," what's the matter if they "repent" a little? I thought that "pretend surrender" and "pretend repentance" were both acceptable. I did not realize that this was a shameful act of losing revolutionary integrity. It wasn't until I read the criticism of Bai Ren's praised "pretend surrender" in the "Cultural Life Brief Review" of the People's Daily on December 2, 1951, that I was shocked and suddenly woke up. It turned out that I had been poisoned by Bai Ren's erroneous thoughts without knowing it!

    This matter gave me a great education, making me realize that in order to make literature and art serve the people and become a fighting weapon that enlightens and educates the people, the first requirement is that literary workers themselves have a high degree of political awareness and ideological level. Otherwise, it is impossible to create works that encourage the people to move forward and educate the people to improve their political awareness. From some literary works with erroneous ideas, it can be seen that some authors have very low political awareness, and they still have serious bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological tendencies, thus creating works that distort reality and harm readers. These works not only fail to educate readers, but instead make readers regress, numb, and even go astray. I sincerely hope that literary workers across the country will recognize the importance of their responsibilities, respond to the rectification movement in Beijing's literary and art circles, work hard to study, earnestly transform their thinking, and create works that are beneficial to the people!

    Ideological Leadership Should Be Strengthened in the Reform of Opera

    Comrade Editor: In August 1951, I worked in the Investigation and Research Committee of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and the Beijing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles. During a month of work, I felt that the Literature and Art Department did not do enough work to reform old literature and art. For example, the Literature and Art Department only knew about the repertoire performed by about ten troupes in Beijing every day. The Literature and Art Department did not know what plays the remaining troupes were performing at all. As for the Quyi segments performed by various entertainment clubs and tea art clubs every day, the Literature and Art Department did not know either. Now, in the people's capital, there are still many Quyi troupes that frequently perform pornographic, feudal, and low-level operas, but the Literature and Art Department cannot help them carry out the necessary reforms. This shows that the Literature and Art Department has shown a great lack of ideological leadership on this issue.

    Secondly, taking the theater aspect as an example, the Theater Management Section of the Literature and Art Department and the Beijing Municipal Theater Management Committee are only busy with state-owned theaters, and do not lead private theaters. At present, most private theaters still maintain the unreasonable old system, which has reduced the positions for performing new operas.

    Now, the Beijing literary and art circles are launching a rectification and study movement, which is worth congratulating. It is hoped that the Municipal Literature and Art Department can overcome past shortcomings in order to better serve the people of the capital.

    Reply from the Literature and Art Department of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education

    Comrade Editor: Comrade Liu Junjie's criticism is very good, and we are very grateful. We have had shortcomings in the management of various opera troupes in Beijing's opera circles and the mastery of the programs performed in the past. For example, we did not pay enough attention to small opera troupes. We will definitely find ways to overcome this shortcoming in the future.

    Regarding the management of private theaters, our work also has shortcomings. In the past, we only focused on the management of state-owned theaters, and originally wanted to use this to influence other private theaters, but we relaxed the specific leadership of private theaters. In the future, we must strengthen contact with the Theater Industry Guild (an industry organization of private theaters) and strengthen the leadership of private theaters so that our work can be gradually improved.

    文艺工作者应创作反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的作品
    编辑同志：目前全国正在大张旗鼓地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，我们的文艺工作者，有责任多创作以这一运动为题材的文艺作品，来教育全国人民。
    我觉得华君武同志在人民日报上发表的两幅漫画，已经给我们提供了好的范例。第一幅画“利令智昏”（发表在一九五一年十二月二十四日人民日报），生动地刻划出奸商的“糖衣炮弹”的危险性，它给某些革命立场不坚定的干部一个有力的教育。第二幅画“秘密的偷窃和公开的破坏”（发表在一九五一年十二月二十八日人民日报），极其鲜明地揭露出“贪污”和“浪费”对于国家财产的危害性，并且批判了以“浪费一些不算什么”、“没有功劳有苦劳，理该享受”、“为小公家谋福利”等为藉口的错误思想和盗窃行为。这两幅画，对于批判错误思想，推动运动前进，起了一定的作用。
    我希望文艺工作者都能够针对群众在这一运动中的各种思想情况，通过各种文艺形式，加以揭露、批判或者表扬，使运动开展得更深入。

    祝贺作家老舍荣获“人民艺术家”荣誉奖状
    编辑同志：我们在报纸上看到了作家老舍先生荣获“人民艺术家”荣誉奖状的消息后，十分兴奋。我们衷心拥护北京市人民政府这一正确的措施。老舍先生的剧本“龙须沟”，具体地表现了北京市市政建设为劳动人民服务的方针，反映了人民对人民政府的热爱；在写作技术方面，和运用群众语言方面，都有良好的成就。这个剧本已受到劳动人民的热烈欢迎。最近，我们河北省立芦台中学也演出了这个剧本，得到全体观众的赞扬。我们觉得北京市人民政府给老舍先生的表扬是十分必要的。这表示人民政府对于作家的劳动是非常尊重的。我们祝贺老舍先生荣获奖状，同时希望老舍先生继续多创作为人民所需要的文艺作品。我们更希望全国文艺工作者，都能为满足人民的文学艺术的要求而努力。    史秀兰  张建中
    向英雄的文艺战士高玉宝学习
    编辑同志：我读了一九五一年十二月十六日人民日报“抗美援朝专刊”上刊载的“英雄的文艺战士高玉宝”一文，深深地为他那坚定的写作毅力所感动。高玉宝只上过一个多月学，现在就能够写出一部三十万字的小说。如果没有党的培养、教育，同志们的鼓励、帮助，和他自己的艰苦努力，是不可能有这样的成就的。高玉宝决心把自己所受的压迫，告诉全国的阶级弟兄，让他们“记住万恶的敌人，枪杆子握得更紧”；他要让他的父亲和弟弟分清敌友，牢牢记住过去的仇恨，为建设新社会而努力。他有了这种写作目的，就产生了一种特殊的力量，促使他下决心：“一年写不成，写它二年，两年写不成，写它五年，一定要写出来”。这是多么可贵的品质和惊人的毅力！我从这里看到了劳动人民的子弟，有着多么大的创造性和坚韧性。我从这里知道了只有满怀为人民服务的写作感情和写作目的，才能写出好的文艺作品。我平时也爱好文艺写作，可是仅仅从我个人的兴趣出发。这样的写作态度，是极不正确的，它是阻碍我进步的最大原因。我决心向高玉宝同志学习，端正我的文艺写作态度，确立为人民服务的写作目的，争取做一个人民的文艺战士。

    希望各地文艺工作者响应北京文艺界的整风学习运动
    编辑同志：我在“人民文学”三卷五期上读了白刃的小说“血战天门顶”以后，曾经错误地认为
    “将计就计”实行“假投降”的办法很好。我自己看了不算，还热情地向别人推荐这篇作品。这说明了我完全作了白刃的错误思想的俘虏。我有了这种错误的认识，所以在读“上饶集中营”一书时，就发生过这样的矛盾；一方面我为英雄们的顽强不屈的精神所感动，钦佩他们的高尚的革命品质和气节，另一方面，又觉得他们不懂“战术”。我想：特务们既然要他们“悔过”，他们“悔一悔过”又有什么关系呢？我认为“假投降”和“假悔过”都是可以的。我没有认识到这是可耻地丧失革命气节的行为。直到我读了人民日报一九五一年十二月二日“文化生活简评”对于白刃所歌颂的“假投降”的批评才大吃一惊，猛醒过来。原来我受了白刃的错误思想的毒害而不自知！
    这件事情给我一个很大的教育，使我认识到要使文学艺术为人民服务，成为启发人民，教育人民的战斗武器，首先便要求文艺工作者本身有高度的政治觉悟和思想水平，不然，就不可能创作出鼓舞人民前进，教育人民提高政治觉悟的作品。从一些有错误思想的文艺作品中，可以看出有些作者的政治觉悟很低，他们还有严重的资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想倾向，因而创作出歪曲现实，贻害读者的作品。这些作品不但不能教育读者，反而使读者后退，麻痹，甚至走入歧途。我诚恳地希望全国文艺工作者认识自己的责任的重大，响应北京市文艺界的整风运动，努力学习，切实改造自己的思想，创作对人民群众有益的作品！    罗民师

    对戏曲改革工作应加强思想领导
    编辑同志：一九五一年八月，我曾在北京市文艺处、北京市文学艺术界联合会的调查研究委员会工作。在一个月的工作当中，我感觉文艺处改革旧文艺的工作作得不够。比方，北京市各班社每日上演的剧目，文艺处就只知道十来家，其余的班社演什么戏，文艺处根本不知道。至于各游艺社、茶艺社每天演唱的曲艺段子，文艺处也不知道。现在人民首都还有许多曲艺班社经常上演色情、封建、低级趣味的戏曲，而文艺处不能帮助他们进行必要的改革。这说明文艺处在这个问题上表现了十分缺乏思想领导。
    其次，拿剧场方面来说，文艺处的剧场管理科和北京市属剧场管理委员会都只忙于搞公营剧场，对私营剧场不加领导，目前大部分私营剧场还保持着不合理的旧制度，这就缩小了上演新戏曲的阵地。
    现在北京文艺界正展开整风学习运动，这是值得祝贺的，希望市文艺处能克服过去的缺点，以期能更好地为首都人民服务。  刘钧杰
    北京市文教局文艺处的答复
    编辑同志：刘钧杰同志对我们的批评很好，我们很感谢。我们过去对北京市戏曲界各班社的管理和上演节目的掌握上都是有缺点的。譬如对小的戏曲班社就注意不够。今后我们一定想办法克服这一缺点。
    关于私营剧场管理问题，我们的工作也是有缺点的。过去，只偏重在作公营剧场的管理工作，原想借此影响其他私营剧场，而对私营剧场的具体领导就放松了，今后我们一定要和剧场业同业公会（私营剧场的一个同业组织）加强联系，加强对私营剧场的领导，使我们的工作逐步得到改进。
