The U.S.-Japanese Reactionaries Can Only Find Failure in Taiwan
    In a letter to U.S. government representative and warmonger Dulles on December 24 last year, Japanese reactionary government Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida openly guaranteed the U.S. government that the Japanese government would conclude a so-called "bilateral treaty" with the remnant reactionary bandit gang of the Kuomintang in Taiwan. This is a further act of criminal behavior by the Japanese reactionary Yoshida government, following the sale of Japanese national interests to the United States and the signing of a separate "Peace Treaty with Japan" and the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" in September last year, to further submit to U.S. imperialism and collude with it to act as a tool for the United States in preparing for a new war of aggression in the Far East.
    This shameless behavior of the reactionary Yoshida government not only completely violates the will of the Japanese people, but also is an open act of hostility towards the Chinese people, creating a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world. Because, first, as is well known, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the only legal representative of the interests of the Chinese people, has repeatedly declared that the U.S.-made separate peace treaty with Japan is completely illegal and invalid, and the Chinese people absolutely cannot recognize it. The Japanese reactionary Yoshida government, in blatant disregard of this solemn will of the Chinese people, after accepting the U.S. separate peace treaty with Japan that excludes China, is attempting to illegally associate with the remnant reactionary bandit gang of the Kuomintang in Taiwan, which has long been unanimously rejected by the Chinese people. This is clearly a major provocation against the Chinese people. Second, in his letter to Dulles, Yoshida Shigeru arrogantly and openly expressed the Japanese reactionary government's intention to follow U.S. imperialism in making a comeback and implementing aggression against China. Third, the further collusion between the U.S. and Japanese reactionary governments and the remnant Kuomintang bandits is a preparatory step for the United States to manufacture a new war of aggression in the Far East in the context of repeated failures in Asia. This war of aggression will inevitably affect Southeast Asian countries.
    Therefore, the collusion between U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionary government, attempting to conclude a "peace treaty" with the remnant Kuomintang bandits, thereby preparing for a new war of aggression in the Far East, cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of Southeast Asian countries.
    But no matter what kind of collusion U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarist forces and the remnant reactionary bandit gang of the Kuomintang engage in, it does not indicate their strength, but rather their fear of the power of the Asian people and their weakness; they are completely defeatable.
    The fact is very clear that the Japanese reactionary Yoshida government's collusion with the remnant Kuomintang bandits is not only a blind, crazy adventure that disregards the reality of Asia, but also politically and economically leads Japan further down a dead end of self-destruction. After the Japanese reactionary government signed a separate "peace treaty" with the United States, it was universally opposed by the people of China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries, to the point that even the Japanese bourgeois newspaper Asahi Shimbun could not help but painfully feel: "After signing the peace treaty, Japan has become an orphan in Asia." (Asahi Shimbun commentary, October 17, 1951) Now, the Yoshida government is even more openly trying to collude with the remnant Kuomintang bandits, who have been unanimously rejected by the people of Asia and the world, which is tantamount to saying that the Japanese reactionary government has completely cut itself off from Asia, making it, like the remnant Kuomintang bandits in Taiwan and the Korean traitor Syngman Rhee, a wandering ghost in Asia.
    Economically, Yoshida's self-isolation from China and Asia is also a dead end leading to destruction. After Yoshida Shigeru's letter to Dulles was published, the Japanese industrial and trade circles expressed great anxiety and disappointment about the future of the Japanese economy. They believe that: "If trade with the CCP is completely cut off, cheap raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal cannot be imported. Then, it will cause consequences contrary to the necessary conditions for Japan's economic independence – reducing production costs and industrial rationalization." Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of Japan, also admitted that Yoshida Shigeru's collusion with the remnant Kuomintang bandits is "tantamount to abandoning Japan's autonomous economy and peace in Asia." The concerns expressed by people from all walks of life in Japan about the crisis in Japan's economic future caused by the Yoshida reactionary government's repeated perverse actions of voluntarily cutting itself off from the Asian economic system fully demonstrate what kind of crazy suicidal behavior Yoshida's collusion with the remnant Kuomintang bandits is in the Japanese economy.
    The Yoshida reactionary government's frantic behavior of betraying the country and currying favor with foreigners makes the patriotic people of Japan have to actively rise up and wage a resolute and irreconcilable struggle against the Yoshida traitorous government and its American masters in order to save the fate of the nation. The Yoshida government will therefore be in an extremely isolated position surrounded by enemies among the Japanese people.
    Obviously, for the Chinese people, it is futile for the Japanese reactionary Yoshida government to collude with the remnant reactionary bandit gang of the Kuomintang in any way. The Japanese Yoshida government's conclusion of a so-called "bilateral treaty" with the remnant Kuomintang bandits will not affect the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan in the slightest. The Chinese people, having defeated Japanese imperialism in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, defeated the United States and the Kuomintang bandit army in the three-year War of Liberation, and jointly defeated the invading armies of the United States and its vassal states with the Korean people in the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, will inevitably be able to defeat the collusion between the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and the remnant Kuomintang bandits and any new aggressive offensives they attempt to launch. In the struggle against the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, the Chinese people are closely united with the Japanese people and the people of all Asian countries. At the same time, the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of all Asian countries have powerful and reliable friends in this struggle, namely the socialist Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the laborers and oppressed nations all over the world who are fighting against imperialism. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance particularly demonstrates its extremely great significance for safeguarding peace and security in the Far East.
    Therefore, the Japanese reactionary Yoshida government's collusion with the remnant Kuomintang bandits at the behest of its American masters to oppose the great People's Republic of China and the great Sino-Soviet alliance only shows the madness of the imperialist aggressive camp; and madness, of course, does not generate any power. Let the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of all Asian countries further unite and fight more heroically for the cause of peace in the Far East! Victory must be ours!

### 美日反动派只能从台湾找到失败

    美日反动派只能从台湾找到失败
    日本反动政府首相吉田茂在去年十二月二十四日给美国政府代表、战争贩子杜勒斯的信中，公然向美国政府保证日本政府将与台湾国民党反动残余匪帮缔结所谓“双边条约”。这是日本吉田反动政府在去年九月出卖日本民族利益与美国签订了单独“对日和约”与“美日安全条约”之后，进一步向美国帝国主义屈服并勾结起来，以充当美国在远东准备新的侵略战争的工具的罪恶行为。
    吉田茂反动政府的这种无耻行为，不但完全违反了日本人民的意志，而且是公开与中国人民为敌，造成了对远东与世界和平的重大威胁。因为，第一，人所周知，唯一合法代表中国人民利益的中华人民共和国中央人民政府，早已一再宣布美制单独对日和约是完全非法的和无效的，中国人民绝对不能予以承认。日本吉田反动政府在公然不顾中国人民的这一庄严意志，接受了美国排斥中国在外的单独对日和约之后，竟企图与早为中国人民所一致弃绝的台湾国民党反动残余匪帮非法交往，这显然是对中国人民的重大挑衅。第二，吉田茂在给杜勒斯的信中，十分狂妄而露骨地表示了日本反动政府将追随美国帝国主义卷土重来，对中国实行侵略的图谋。第三，美、日反动政府和国民党残匪的进一步勾结，是美国在亚洲连遭失败的情形下，企图在远东制造新的侵略战争的准备步骤，这个侵略战争当然不能不波及东南亚各国。
    因此，美国帝国主义与日本反动政府的互相勾结，企图与国民党反动残匪缔结“和约”，从而准备新的远东侵略战争的阴谋，不能不引起中国人民、日本人民和东南亚各国人民的严重警惕。
    但是不论美国帝国主义与日本军国主义势力以及国民党反动残余匪帮进行怎样的勾结，都并不是表示它们的强大，而是表示了它们对亚洲人民力量的恐惧和它们的虚弱；它们是完全可以被打败的。
    事实很明白，日本吉田反动政府与国民党残匪勾结，不但是无视于亚洲现实的盲目的疯狂的冒险，而且在政治上、经济上使日本更进一步走上了自取灭亡的死路。在日本反动政府与美国签订了单独“和约”，因而遭受到中苏两国及亚洲各国人民的普遍反对之后，甚至使日本资产阶级报纸朝日新闻也不能不痛感到：“签订和约后，日本已成为亚洲的孤儿。”（一九五一年十月十七日朝日新闻评论）现在，吉田政府更公然要与亚洲和世界人民所一致弃绝的国民党残匪勾结起来，这也就无异于说，日本反动政府由此而宣告完全自绝于亚洲，使它与台湾国民党残匪以及朝鲜卖国贼李承晚之流同样成为亚洲的孤魂野鬼。
    在经济上，吉田自绝于中国和亚洲也同样是一条走向毁灭的绝路。在吉田茂给杜勒斯的信发表以后，日本的产业界和贸易界对日本经济的前途已表示了极大的焦虑和失望。他们认为：“如果和中共的贸易完全断绝了，铁矿、粘结性煤等廉价原料就不能进口。那么，就会造成和日本经济自立的必要条件——减低生产成本、产业合理化——相反的后果。”日本的社会党左派中央执行委员会主席铃木茂三郎也承认：吉田茂与国民党残匪的勾结，“无异于放弃日本的自主经济和亚洲的和平”。日本各阶层人民对于因吉田反动政府的一再与亚洲经济体系自行割绝的倒行逆施，而造成的日本经济前途的危机所表示的忧虑，充分说明了吉田与国民党反动残匪的勾结，在日本经济上是怎样一种疯狂的自杀行为。
    吉田反动政府媚外卖国的丧心病狂行为，使得日本的爱国人民不能不积极奋起，为挽救民族的命运，而与吉田卖国政府及其美国主子进行坚决的、不调和的斗争。吉田政府将因此而在日本人民当中更陷于四面楚歌的极端孤立的地位。
    显然的，对于中国人民来说，日本吉田反动政府与国民党反动残匪无论如何勾结都是徒然的。日本吉田政府与国民党残匪缔结所谓“双边条约”，丝毫也不影响中国人民解放台湾的决心。中国人民既曾在八年抗日战争中打败了日本帝国主义，在三年解放战争中打败了美国与国民党匪军，在伟大的抗美援朝战争中与朝鲜人民共同打败了美国及其附庸国家的侵略军，就必然同样能够打败美、日反动派及国民党残匪的互相勾结及其所企图发动的任何新的侵略进攻。中国人民在反对美、日反动派的斗争中，是与日本人民及全亚洲各国人民紧紧团结在一起的。同时，中国人民、日本人民和全亚洲人民在这一斗争中，还有着强大的可靠的朋友，那就是社会主义的苏联、各人民民主国家以及为反对帝国主义而斗争的全世界的劳动者和被压迫民族。中苏友好同盟互助条约，在这里特别显出了它对于保卫远东和平与安全的极端伟大的意义。
    因此，日本吉田反动政府奉美国主人之命勾结国民党残匪而反对伟大的中华人民共和国和伟大的中苏同盟，只是说明了帝国主义侵略阵营的发疯；而发疯，这当然并不产生什么力量。中国人民、日本人民和亚洲各国人民进一步团结起来，更加英勇地为远东和平事业而奋斗吧！胜利一定是我们的！
