    We have no invincible enemies, no insurmountable difficulties!
    --A letter from Wang Jianhun, representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning delegation, to the people of the motherland

    Dear compatriots and comrades of the motherland!
    Last October, I left the motherland and returned to the Korean front with excitement. This was the same as my mood when I returned to the motherland half a year ago. I felt excited and fresh everywhere. In a word, the Korean front today has changed greatly from when I left half a year ago. From the front to the rear, there is a new atmosphere. This is the result of the heroic Volunteer Army comrades' efforts with unparalleled labor and wisdom over the past six months. In the heroes' own words: "We love the motherland and Chairman Mao; for the motherland and Chairman Mao, we have no invincible enemies and no insurmountable difficulties!"

    Every unit I visited expressed a warm welcome to me. They said: "The returning delegation brought the news of our victory on the front to the motherland, and now they are returning to the Korean front from the motherland with the news of the various construction victories of the motherland. They also represent the people of the motherland in conveying their love and hope to us. We warmly welcome you!"

    Grand meetings were held in the ravines, forests, and huge underground rooms, as enthusiastically as in the motherland. Everyone tied maple leaves and pine branches from the mountains into flower clusters to present to us. Bugles replaced the orchestra, playing majestic welcome music. In the cold and snowy nights, everyone's body was covered with a thick layer of white frost, and they listened quietly to our reports, persisting for four or six hours. Everyone said, "Hearing the news from the motherland, we forget the cold..." Sometimes everyone asked to sit facing the direction of the motherland to listen to the report, regardless of the limitations of the venue and terrain, and they insisted on sitting facing northwest. They wrote down their most concerning questions on slips of paper and passed them to me, asking me to answer them, such as: "Are Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in good health?" "What is the situation of the motherland's national defense construction?" "Are our cities more prosperous than before?" "How is this year's harvest?" "Has the lives of the people of the motherland improved?" and many other questions. We answered them according to what we could understand, but they never seemed to be satisfied. When I once talked about the scene of the people of the motherland shaking hands with us, several young soldiers ran up to shake hands with me. They said: "You shook hands with the people of the motherland. Now we shake hands with you again, and it is as pleasant and glorious as shaking hands directly with the people of the motherland."

    After the troops listened to our reports, they launched discussions and studies. Everyone connected with themselves, reviewed the past, and formulated plans for future meritorious service, solemnly swearing to the people of the motherland: "We are determined to fight more tenaciously and strive for greater victories to repay the love and support of the people of the motherland!"

    In the past two months, I have walked from the east line to the central line, and witnessed the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fighting day and night, defending and consolidating our positions.

    In the Kimhwa-Pyeonggang area of the central line, a certain unit of our Volunteer Army created a brilliant example in the blocking battle. They have been in their positions since the beginning of June, and it has been seven months now. They have continuously repelled countless fierce attacks by the enemy, killing and wounding more than 14,000 enemies. The enemy rotated and replaced four different numbered units, but they were all beaten to a pulp by us and retreated.

    For seven months, day and night, on every inch of land in this position, fierce battles have been fought with the enemy. The enemy mobilized the strength of four infantry divisions and a Turkish brigade, and relied on its superior air force and artillery fire to bombard our positions fiercely, changing the entire terrain. However, the soldiers were so familiar and affectionate with every inch of land and every stone, and had deep feelings for this land where blood and sweat were condensed. Some soldiers said to their bunkers: "As long as I am here, you are here; you protect me, and I protect you." The enemy's artillery fire blasted the bunkers during the day, and the soldiers rebuilt them at night, blasted them again, and rebuilt them again... They have lived on this land for seven months. Although the appearance of this land has changed, its owner has not changed. Among these positions, there are two most glorious names, one is called "Western Mountain" and the other is called "Chicken Peak Mountain". On Chicken Peak Mountain, we launched six counterattacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the invading enemy. The 35th Regiment of the U.S. 25th Division was beaten and bloodied and retreated, and two regiments of the puppet 9th Division were also beaten and lost their combat effectiveness. On Western Mountain, after twenty days of fierce fighting, the enemy desperately occupied this position twice, but we counterattacked and recaptured it. In the counterattack on June 23, most of the two companies of the 15th Regiment of the U.S. 3rd Division were annihilated; another time, our single company counterattacked the two 760-meter high mountains of Western Mountain and Dou Niu Feng, and it only took a day and night to eliminate most of the three companies of the 35th Regiment of the U.S. 25th Division, killing and wounding 568 enemies, capturing 30 enemies, and retaking the position that the enemy had attacked for eighteen days at the cost of more than a thousand casualties, and firmly defended it. In this battle, the heroic soldier and Communist Party member Comrade Huang Deming led a battle group to defend a position, continuously repelling three charges by two companies of the enemy. In the end, only he was left, and the bullets were also exhausted. Seven enemies were still making the final desperate attack, and they were about to rush into the position. Comrade Huang Deming hugged the only anti-tank grenade he had left and rushed into the enemy crowd. With a loud "boom!", he perished together with the seven enemies. The outstanding Communist Party member Comrade Huang Deming heroically sacrificed himself, but the heroic position remained unmoved and was never occupied by the enemy.

    For example, the heroic squad leader Comrade Li Guang, when their position was divided and surrounded by the enemy, he was wounded in five places on his body. When others asked him to go down, he said: "You must eliminate the enemies who wounded me to truly cherish me!" He resolutely refused to leave the front line, continued to command the entire squad to cleverly and flexibly detour behind the enemy, defeated the enemy, defended the position, and destroyed and damaged one enemy tank each, and also captured a heavy machine gun.

    For seven months, the soldiers fought bravely, tenaciously, cleverly, and flexibly on the one hand, and on the other hand, they continuously built and improved their "position homes" - fortifications with super-physical labor. They dug through the mountains and built fortifications inside the mountains, with dormitories, corridors, and underground mansion clubs. When thousands of heavy shells exploded on the top of the mountain, the soldiers sat safely in their fortifications wiping their guns or playing poker!

    For seven months, they encountered many unimaginable hardships and difficulties, but they demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary heroism and optimism, endured all the hardships and overcame all the difficulties with strong perseverance and genius wisdom.

    After more than a year of destruction and sabotage by U.S. imperialism, there are very few houses in Korea, especially in the front-line areas, where it is rare to see houses and villages. The troops divided several ravines according to each department, built their own houses and bunkers, and built new villages. Some units gave these new villages new names to facilitate identification. These new villages will eternally mark the profound brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. These houses and bunkers are very solidly constructed, with three basic standards: protection against artillery shells, rain, and moisture. The bunkers of the second-line troops and organs are not only air-raid proof, but also have sufficient sunlight for office work. The bunkers have self-made tables, chairs, benches, and fire pits. A comrade who used to run a dyeing workshop used the principle of a dyeing pot to create a "smokeless fire pit". This kind of fire pit does not emit smoke, which is suitable for air defense and can extend the insulation time. In addition, they also built more than 30 charcoal kilns themselves. Each kiln can produce more than 1,000 catties of charcoal, burning a large amount of charcoal and transporting it to the bunkers of the soldiers on the front line to resist the severe cold.

    Many difficulties were also encountered in terms of tools and daily necessities, but many ingenious creations emerged to overcome these difficulties. When digging tunnel fortifications, the cross-pointed crowbar was ground from long to short, from short to bald, and finally ground into something like an iron hammer. When the pit was dug deep, it was difficult to remove the soil, so the soldiers erected booms at the entrance of the hole and used fried noodle boxes or burlap bags to hoist the soil upwards. Some put wheels on the four corners of the boxes or baskets to make trailers. There were no lights in the cave, so the soldiers lit pine oil and used glass lenses and reflective metal iron sheets to reflect light into the cave during the day. There were no sickles for cutting horse grass, so they transformed the shortened iron shovels into sickles, and some used gun and cannon shells to make their own sickles. For long-distance telephones, there were no insulating porcelain bottles, so the telephone operators collected broken rubber shoe soles and broken wheel belts everywhere and wrapped them around the electric poles to replace the insulating porcelain bottles. Doctors invented homemade distilleries to solve the difficulty of lacking distilled water. There was no paper for office work and study, so they used the reactionary leaflets dropped by enemy planes, boiled off the words and paintings on them with soapy water, and used them to make notebooks, wall newspapers, "poker", write letters, etc. Therefore, the soldiers humorously complained that the enemy planes dropped too few leaflets.

    In the tense and arduous life of the position, everyone's demand for cultural entertainment was very urgent, so they used canned cylinders, wire copper wire, wooden sticks, and horse tails to make erhus. A certain artillery unit made more than 40 erhus and formed an orchestra. In addition, they used artillery shells, broken copper sheets, and fried noodle boxes to make a set of percussion instruments, and often organized lively evening parties in the bunkers and in the mountains.

    Now, in order to respond to the motherland's production increase and economy campaign, the troops have thoroughly implemented "streamlining and saving", and the work has become more intense, with one person doing the work of two. Due to the reduction of logistics personnel, the cadres have promoted the hard-working and hardworking style, and many cadres have participated in carrying stretchers, and some section chiefs have also participated in transporting grain. Everyone said: "The people of the motherland are increasing production and economizing, supporting us with every drop of blood and sweat. We must cherish every grain of food and every bullet from the motherland, reduce the burden on the people of the motherland, and in order to repay the love of the people of the motherland, we are determined to work more intensively, fight more bravely, and strive for greater victories until we finally defeat the aggression of U.S. imperialism!"

    我们没有打不败的敌人，没有克服不了的困难！
    ——人民志愿军归国代表团代表王剑魂给祖国人民的一封信亲爱的祖国同胞们，同志们！
    去年十月里，我抱着兴奋的心情，离开了祖国，回到朝鲜前线。这和在半年前回到祖国时的心情一样，处处感到兴奋，处处感到新鲜。一句话，今天的朝鲜前线，比我半年前离开的时候，大大地变了样子。从前线到后方，都呈现着一片新的气象，这是英雄的志愿军全体同志半年来以无比的劳动和智慧创造的成果。用英雄们自己的话说那就是：“我们热爱祖国，热爱毛主席；为了祖国，为了毛主席，我们面前没有打不败的敌人，没有克服不了的困难！”
    我所走到的每个部队，都对我表示了热烈的欢迎。他们说：“归国代表把我们前线战斗的胜利消息带到祖国去，现在又从祖国带着祖国人民各种建设的胜利消息回到朝鲜前线，并代表着祖国人民转达祖国人民对我们的热爱和希望，我们热烈地欢迎！”
    隆重的大会，在山沟、在森林及在巨大的地下室里举行，也像在祖国一样热烈。大家把山上的枫叶和松枝扎成花簇献给我们，军号代替管弦乐队，吹奏起雄壮的欢迎曲来。在风雪凛冽的深夜里，大家身上凝结着一层厚厚的白霜，都静静地听取我们的报告，一直坚持四小时或六小时，大家说：“听到祖国的消息，忘记了寒冷……”有时大家要求面向祖国方向坐着听报告，不管会场与地形的限制，也一定要面向西北坐。他们用纸条写着他们最关切的问题传给我，要我解答，如：“毛主席和朱总司令身体健康吗？”“祖国国防建设情形怎样？”“我们的城市比以前更繁荣了吗？”“今年的收成怎样？”“祖国人民生活是否有了改善？”等等许多问题，我们根据自己所能了解到的情况都作了答复，但他们似乎总是不能满足。当我有一次谈到祖国人民和我们握手的情形的时候，有几个青年战士也跑上来和我握手，他们说：“你和祖国人民握了手，我们现在再和你握手，也像和祖国人民直接握手一样的愉快和光荣。”
    部队听了我们的报告以后，都展开了讨论与学习，大家联系自己，检讨过去，并订出今后的立功计划，庄严地向祖国人民宣誓：“决以更顽强的战斗，争取更伟大的胜利，来回答祖国人民对我们的热爱与支援！”
    两个月来，我从东线走到中线，亲眼看到志愿军和朝鲜人民军日日夜夜奋战着，坚守并巩固了我们的阵地。
    在中线金化至平康一带，我志愿军某部，在阻击战中创造了辉煌的范例。他们自六月初进入阵地，到现在已经七个月，他们曾连续击退敌人无数次猛烈攻击，杀伤敌人一万四千多名。敌人轮班调换了四个不同番号的部队，但都被我们打得焦头烂额的撤下去。
    七个月来，日日夜夜，在这个阵地的每一寸土地上，都和敌人展开了激烈的争夺战。敌人动用了四个步兵师和一个土耳其旅的兵力，更依仗其优势的空军与炮火，向我阵地上猛烈轰击，使整个地形都变了样子，但是战士们对这每一寸土地，每一块石头，都是那样熟悉而亲切，对这些血汗凝结的土地，有着深厚的情感，有的战士对着自己的地堡说：“有我在，就有你在；你保护我，我保护你。”敌人的炮火白天把地堡炸塌了，战士们夜里把它盖起来，再炸塌了，再盖起来……。他们就这样生活在这片土地上七个月了。这片土地的样子虽然变了，但它的主人却没有变。这些阵地当中有两个最辉煌的名字，一个叫做“西方山”，一个叫做“鸡雄山”。在鸡雄山上，我们六次反击，都给进犯的敌人以重大杀伤。美军二十五师三十五团被打得头破血流的撤下去，伪九师两个团也被打得失掉战斗力。在西方山上，我们经过了二十天激烈的争夺战，敌人曾拚死把这个阵地两度占领，但都被我们反击夺回。六月二十三日的那次反击，美军第三师第十五团有两个连的兵力大部就歼；又一次我仅一个连的兵力反击西方山和斗牛峰两个七百六十多公尺的高山，只用一昼夜的时间，便消灭了守敌美军二十五师三十五团三个连的大部，杀伤敌人五百六十八名，俘敌三十名，把敌人以千余人伤亡的代价攻击了十八天才占去的阵地重又夺回，而且牢固地守住了它。在这次战斗中，英雄的战士共产党员黄德明同志，带领一个战斗小组守住一个阵地，连续打退敌人两个连三次冲锋，最后只剩他一个人了，子弹也打光了，七个敌人仍在作最后的绝望攻击，眼看冲进了阵地。黄德明同志把仅有的一颗反坦克手雷，斜抱起来，冲进敌人群里，“轰！”的一声巨响，和七个敌人同归于尽。优秀的共产党员黄德明同志壮烈的牺牲了，但英雄的阵地却屹然未动，始终没有被敌人占领。
    又如：英雄班长李广同志，当他们的阵地被敌人分割包围的时候，他一人身上五处负伤，别人叫他下去，他说：“你们把打伤我的那些敌人消灭了，才是真正地爱护我！”他坚决不下火线，继续指挥全班机智灵活地迂回到敌人后面，打垮了敌人，守住了阵地，并击毁击伤敌人战车各一辆，还缴获重机枪一挺。
    七个月来，战士们一面英勇顽强机智灵活地战斗着，一面又以超体力的劳动不断地构筑和改进着自己的“阵地之家”——工事，他们挖通了山，将工事修在山里，里面有宿舍、有走廊，还有地下大厦俱乐部。当敌人成千发的重型炮弹在山顶上爆炸的时候，战士们都安然地坐在自己的工事里拭枪或打扑克呢！
    七个月来，他们碰到了很多难以想像的艰苦和困难，但他们发挥了高度的革命英雄主义和乐观主义的精神，以坚强的毅力和天才的智慧，忍受了所有的艰苦，克服了所有的困难。
    经过美帝国主义一年多的摧残和破坏，朝鲜的房屋很少了，特别在火线地带，很少看到房舍和村庄。部队便按各部门划分几道山沟，自己盖房子筑地堡，建设起新的村庄来，有些单位为了便于识别，把这些新的村落都起上了新的名字。这些新的村落，将永恒地标志着中朝人民深厚的兄弟友谊。这些房子和地堡，构筑得非常坚固，都有三个基本的标准：防炮弹、防雨水和防潮湿。二线部队和机关的地堡，不但能防空，而且有充足的阳光适合办公。地堡里有自制的桌椅板凳及火炕，有个从前开过染房的同志，利用烧染锅的原理，制造了“无烟火炕”，这种炕不向外冒烟，既适合防空，又能延长保暖时间。另外还自己建设了三十多座木炭窑，每窑一次可出木炭一千多斤，烧出大批木炭，运到前线战士们的地堡里去，抵抗严寒。
    在工具和日常用具方面也碰到了很多困难，但也出现了很多天才的创造，克服了这些困难。在挖坑道工事的时候，十字洋镐由长磨短，由短磨秃，最后磨成个铁锤一样的东西了。坑洞挖深了，向外出土困难，战士们便在洞口架起吊杆，用炒面箱子或麻布袋向上吊土。有的把箱子或筐子的四角，做上轮子，做拖车用。洞里没有灯，战士们就点松油，白天在洞口用玻璃镜片及反光的金属铁片向洞里反光。割马草没有镰刀，便把磨短了的铁锨改造成镰刀，也有的用枪炮弹皮来自己打成镰刀。长途电话，没有绝缘体瓷瓶，电话员便各处去搜集破碎的橡胶鞋底及破轮带，缠在电杆上代替绝缘体瓷瓶。医生们发明了土造蒸溜器，解决了缺蒸溜水的困难。办公、学习没有纸张，便把敌人飞机上撒下的反动传单，用肥皂水煮掉上面的字画，做笔记本，出墙报，做“扑克”，写信……等用，因此战士们幽默地埋怨着敌机传单撒得太少了。
    紧张艰苦的阵地生活，大家对文化娱乐的要求非常迫切，于是便用罐头筒子、电线铜丝、木棍及马尾做成胡琴。某部炮兵做了四十多把胡琴组成了一个乐队。此外用炮弹壳、破铜片及炒面箱子等，做出一套打击乐器，经常在地堡里，在山林里，组织起热闹的晚会来。
    现在，为了响应祖国人民的增产节约运动，部队内彻底实行了“精简节约”，工作更加紧张，一个人要做两个人的工作。由于勤杂人员减少，干部发扬了吃苦耐劳的勤劳作风，许多干部参加抬担架，有些科长还参加运粮。大家都表示：“祖国人民在增产节约，一滴血一滴汗的支援我们，我们要爱惜来自祖国的一粒粮食一颗子弹，减轻祖国人民的负担，为回答祖国人民对我们的热爱，决以更紧张的工作，更勇敢的战斗，争取更伟大的胜利，直到最后击败美帝国主义的侵略！”
