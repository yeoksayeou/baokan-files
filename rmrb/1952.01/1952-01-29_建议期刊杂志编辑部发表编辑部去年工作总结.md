    Suggestion that Journal and Magazine Editorial Departments Publish Work Summaries from Last Year
    Comrade Editor: Further strengthening the relationship between editors, authors, and readers is one of the prerequisites for running a publication well. Therefore, it is very necessary to present the editorial department's overall work to authors and readers. Only in this way can authors and readers understand the work of the editorial department, understand the nature and purpose of the publication, and understand all the problems existing in the work, thereby mobilizing authors and readers to assist in inspection and provide opinions; running the publication based on the opinions of the masses can improve the quality of the publication.
    The year 1951 has passed, and there is no doubt that the editorial departments of various publications will make a work summary. Therefore, I believe that it is a very meaningful and valuable thing for various journals and magazines to publish this work summary. Especially at a time when the cultural and educational circles are undergoing ideological remolding and calling for improving the ideological, political, and combative nature of publications, this is even more necessary.

    建议期刊杂志编辑部发表编辑部去年工作总结
    编辑同志：进一步地密切编者、作者、读者的关系，是办好刊物的先决条件之一。因此，把编辑部的全盘工作摆出来放在作者和读者面前，就非常必要。只有这样才能使作者和读者知道编辑部的工作，知道刊物的性质和目的，知道工作中存在的一切问题，从而发动作者和读者来协助检查，提供意见；根据群众的意见来办刊物，才可以提高刊物的质量。
    一九五一年已经过去了，毫无疑问，各种刊物的编辑部都要作一次工作总结。因此，我认为各种期刊杂志把这个工作总结刊登出来，是一件很有意义和有价值的事。尤其是在目前文化教育界正进行思想改造和号召提高出版物思想性、政治性、战斗性的时候，这就更有必要。　　俊祥
