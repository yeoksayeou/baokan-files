    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 2nd: At the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on January 2nd, the other side once again raised the hackneyed argument that the armistice agreement would inevitably harm the sovereignty of both sides, and still insisted on the unreasonable demand of interfering in our internal affairs by restricting equipment within Korea. Our representative sternly denounced this absurd argument, pointing out that in the thirty-odd days of discussion, the other side should have undoubtedly and clearly understood that we absolutely cannot allow the armistice agreement to include any clauses that interfere in our internal affairs. However, the other side still insists on this unreasonable demand, the purpose of which can only be to deliberately delay the armistice negotiations. At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, the other side verbally claimed that it agreed to the principle of releasing all prisoners of war as proposed by our side, but publicly refused to repatriate all prisoners of war, and in essence suggested exchanging prisoners of war on a one-to-one basis. The other side currently holds 176,679 of our captured personnel, while we hold 11,559 of the other side's captured personnel. The purpose of the other side's proposal is to detain 165,120 of our captured personnel under various pretexts. Our representative sternly pointed out that the other side's proposal to openly attempt to detain more than 100,000 of our captured personnel is absolutely unacceptable to our side. All peace-loving people in the world will certainly not tolerate such a barbaric and shameful proposal.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 1st: On New Year's Day 1952, our representatives to the Korean armistice negotiations proposed at the subcommittee meetings on the third and fourth agenda items that both sides should make further efforts to resolve the remaining differences of opinion in order to reach an armistice agreement quickly. At the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item, our representative pointed out that the other side must abandon its unreasonable demands to restrict our airport equipment and interfere in our internal affairs. After the other side withdraws this unreasonable demand, other differences can be quickly and reasonably resolved. At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, our representative pointed out that the subcommittee should immediately adopt the principle of promptly releasing all prisoners of war after the signing of the armistice agreement. Regarding the exchange of prisoner of war information, our side has already provided all information on our existing prisoners of war and is still waiting for the other side to provide supplements to the insufficient information it has provided. As for the information requested by the other side regarding all prisoners of war we have captured, our side has repeatedly stated that the vast majority of the other side's captured personnel have been released at the front lines, but our side is still prepared to sort out the relevant information to the extent possible in order to exchange it with the other side on an equal basis.

    对第三项议程美方仍然坚持无理要求
    我方代表痛斥美方故意拖延停战谈判
    在第四项议程小组委员会上美方公然企图扣留我方被俘人员
    【新华社开城二日电】一月二日朝鲜停战谈判的第三项议程的小组委员会上，对方再度提出了所谓停战协议必然将有损双方主权的陈腐滥调，仍然坚持干涉我方内政的限制朝鲜境内设备的无理要求。我方代表痛斥这种荒谬的论点，指出在三十余天的讨论之中，对方应该毫无疑问地、清楚地了解到我方绝对不能允许停战协议中包括任何干涉我方内政的条款。而对方却仍然坚持这种无理要求，其目的只可能是有意地拖延停战谈判。第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方口头声称：同意我方所提出的释放全体战俘的原则，但却又公然拒绝遣送全体战俘，实质上则建议在一对一的基础上交换战俘。对方目前收容我方被俘人员十七万六千六百七十九人，我方收容对方被俘人员一万一千五百五十九人，对方提案的目的就是假借各种名义扣留我方十六万五千一百二十名被俘人员。我方代表严词指出：对方的这种公然企图扣留我方十余万被俘人员的提案，是我方所绝对不能同意的。全世界一切爱好和平的人民也断然不能容忍这种野蛮的，可耻的提案。
    【新华社开城一日电】一九五二年的元旦，朝鲜停战谈判的我方代表在第三项和第四项议程的小组委员会上提出双方应该更进一步地努力解决仅存的双方意见分歧之点，以期迅速达成停战协议。在第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表指出：对方必须放弃限制我方机场设备、干涉我方内政的无理要求。在对方撤消这一无理要求之后，其他分歧之点不难迅速求得合理解决。在第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表指出：小组委员会应该立即通过停战协议签字后迅速释放全体战俘的原则。关于交换战俘材料的问题，我方已经提供了我方现有战俘的全部材料，并仍在等待对方对其所提出的不充分的材料提供补充。至于对方所要求的我方所曾经俘获的全部战俘的材料，我方已经一再说明对方被俘人员中绝大部分都已在前线释放，但我方仍准备在可能范围内整理有关材料，以便在对等的基础上与对方交换。
