Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: According to the Vietnam News Agency from North Vietnam: A spokesperson for the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army stated at a press conference held on the 14th that the French aggressors' plan to expand their military aggression to the Hoa Binh region has basically failed. Now, if the enemy attempts to retreat from Hoa Binh City, they will suffer a severe defeat; but if the enemy attempts to continue occupying Hoa Binh City, then they will suffer an even more severe defeat. (Note: The French invading forces had gathered more than twenty battalions in mid-November of last year to invade the Hoa Binh province region southwest of Hanoi.)

The spokesperson said: Since January 8th, the Vietnamese People's Army began to besiege Hoa Binh City, the provincial capital of Hoa Binh province, and cut off Highway 6 between Hanoi and Hoa Binh City, bringing the transportation of enemy supplies to a standstill. Because the People's Army uprooted the Tu Phu stronghold on the banks of the Black River, crushed the enemy's Black River defense line between Hoa Binh City and Trung Ha, and liberated the Black River and Ba Vi mountain regions, enemy traffic on the Black River has also become very difficult. The enemy in Hoa Binh City can now only rely on air transport to obtain supplies. But even air transport is very difficult, because the People's Army anti-aircraft units surrounding Hoa Binh City are very active.

The spokesperson continued: The situation of the enemy in Hoa Binh City is very critical. According to captured European, African, and mercenary troops and puppet soldiers, food and medicine are running out in the besieged Hoa Binh City, and the enemy's morale is declining day by day.

The spokesperson finally said in response to reporters' inquiries: In the two months since mid-November of last year, the People's Army has killed or captured more than 10,000 enemy troops in the North Vietnam region. The enemy troops currently besieged in Hoa Binh City are waiting for reinforcements to be sent from Xuan Mai (on Highway 6), attempting to open the supply line in order to finally carry out a retreat.

    越南人民军在北越继续进攻
    两个月毙俘敌军万余
    法军侵占和平地区计划已告失败
    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南人民军总部发言人在十四日举行的记者招待会中说：法国侵略者想把军事侵略行动扩大到和平地区的计划基本上已经失败。现在如果敌人企图从和平城退却，他们将遭到严重的失败；但是如果敌人企图继续占领和平城，那么就将遭到更严重的失败。（按法国侵略军曾在去年十一月中旬纠集了二十几个营的兵力，侵犯河内西南的和平省地区。）
    发言人说：从一月八日起，越南人民军就开始包围和平省的省会和平城，并切断了河内与和平城之间的第六号公路，使敌人供应品的运输陷于停顿。由于人民军拔除了黑水江畔的图富据点，粉碎了和平城与中河之间的敌军黑水江防线，解放了黑水江和巴为山地区，敌军在黑水江上的交通也已经甚为困难。和平城中的敌军现在只能依靠空运获得供应品了。可是就连空运也很困难，因为环绕着和平城的人民军防空部队十分活跃。
    发言人接着说：在和平城中的敌人，情况十分危急。据俘掳到的敌人的欧非籍雇佣军和傀儡军说，在被围的和平城中，粮食和药品已经快完，敌军的士气正日渐低落。
    发言人最后在答复记者的询问时说：从去年十一月中旬以来的两个月中，人民军在北越地区共击毙和俘掳了敌军一万多名。目前被围困在和平城中的敌军正在等待从春梅（在第六号公路上）派去援军，企图打开供应线，以便最后实行退却。
