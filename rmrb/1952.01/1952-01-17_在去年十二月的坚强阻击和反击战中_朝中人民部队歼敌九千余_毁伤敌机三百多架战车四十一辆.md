Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 16th: Our front-line reporter reports: In December 1951, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers repelled frequent small-scale enemy offensives with staunch defensive and counter-offensive battles. Due to military defeats and pressure from world public opinion, the American aggressors were forced to reach an agreement with our representatives on the second item of the Korean armistice talks agenda at the Panmunjom conference in late November 1951. At that time, the invading soldiers, eager to end the war and return home, had briefly ceased fire spontaneously, but this action alarmed the warmongering American president and generals. While verbally and feebly clamoring for a bankrupt "military pressure" strategy, they continued to force their demoralized soldiers to conduct small-scale offensives on the snow-covered mountains to maintain the so-called "tense situation" on the Korean battlefield, in order to facilitate their military and political conspiracies. However, the American aggressors' insistence on a war policy resulted in a large number of invading soldiers losing their lives and becoming disabled in frequent small-scale offensives.

In December, the American aggressors launched a total of more than 130 small-scale offensives along the 200-kilometer front line. The number of attacks and the size of the forces gradually increased. After the 14th, for example, enemy company-sized attacks occurred more than five times a day, with each attack using up to 20 tanks. But each offensive was unsuccessful.

The Korean and Chinese People's Armies, in positions with solid fortifications, used fierce artillery fire and dense infantry weapons to kill and wound the invading enemy in front of the positions, creating many examples of inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy with minimal losses. For example, in the battle to repel an enemy battalion attack in the Shangpu-dong and Xiapu-dong area northwest of Lianchuan on the western front on the 16th, our unit killed and wounded more than 120 enemy soldiers at the cost of seven casualties. At the same time, our army also launched small-scale counter-attacks against the enemy in some areas, annihilating many enemy soldiers. Near the Panmunjom Neutral Zone, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies resolutely repelled numerous provocative enemy attacks and intrusions, safeguarding the security of the Korean armistice talks conference area. Our coastal defense forces carried out cross-sea operations on the west coast and successively recovered the islands of Liudao, Chudao, Qingyangdao, Dashuiyadong, and Xiaoshuiyadong. The enemy forces entrenched on these islands were all annihilated.

The increased anti-aircraft firepower of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies and the deployment of the People's Air Force continued to inflict significant blows on the U.S. Air Force. American B-29 heavy bombers and jet fighters flying at high altitudes were frequently hit by our ground fire and air force fire. The American aggressors are now increasingly worried about the loss of "air superiority." During this month, while frequently conducting small-scale offensives on the front lines, the American aggressors also directed the Li pseudo-army to carry out bloody massacres against the unyielding Korean people in southern Korea; at the same time, they accelerated the transfer of troops, replenishment of manpower, and war materials. But people can see from the disastrous defeats of the invading army's summer and autumn offensives that if the American invading army dares to launch another large-scale offensive, it will bring even more disastrous defeat.

The following are the comprehensive results of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies in December:

1.  Annihilated 9,746 enemy troops, including 4,143 American troops, 136 troops from various accomplice countries, and 5,467 troops from the Syngman Rhee puppet army.

2.  Captured 9 anti-aircraft machine guns, 1 light mortar, 3 60mm mortars, 2 rocket launchers, 1 flamethrower, 2 anti-aircraft machine guns, 17 heavy machine guns, 24 light machine guns, 193 automatic rifles, 60 carbines, 11 submachine guns, 40 rifles, 11 pistols, 2 signal guns, 3,089 artillery shells, 148,851 rounds of various bullets, 4,311 hand grenades, 3 radio stations, 5 walkie-talkies, 9 intercoms, 2 wireless telephones, 5 telephones, and 8 pairs of binoculars.

3.  Shot down and damaged 309 enemy aircraft, including 172 enemy aircraft shot down and 137 enemy aircraft damaged. Destroyed and damaged 41 enemy tanks and 38 vehicles. Destroyed 5 artillery pieces. Sunk 9 wooden boats.

    在去年十二月的坚强阻击和反击战中
    朝中人民部队歼敌九千余
    毁伤敌机三百多架战车四十一辆
    【新华社朝鲜前线十六日电】本社前线记者报道：一九五一年十二月间，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军以坚强的阻击战和反击战打退了敌军频繁的小规模进攻。美国侵略者由于军事上遭受惨败和在世界舆论的压力下，被迫于一九五一年十一月下旬在板门店会议上和我方代表达成了朝鲜停战谈判第二项议程的协议。这时，渴望停战回家的侵略军士兵曾经一度自动停火，但是这一行动急坏了好战的美国总统和将军们。他们一面口硬心虚地喧嚷早已破产了的“军事压力”，一面继续迫使其士气沮丧的士兵在大雪纷飞的山岭上进行小规模进攻，来维持朝鲜战场的所谓“紧张状态”，以利他们进行军事的和政治的阴谋活动。但美国侵略者坚持战争政策的结果，又使大批侵略军士兵在频繁的小规模进攻中丧失了生命和变成了残废者。
    十二月份，美国侵略者在二百多公里长的战线上共计进行了一百三十多次小规模的进攻，它们进攻的次数和兵力都是逐渐增加的。如十四日以后，成营敌军的进攻每天在五次以上，敌军每次使用战车曾增到二十多辆。但每次进攻都遭到失败。
    朝中人民军队在筑有坚固工事的阵地上，用猛烈的炮火和密集的步兵火器把进犯的敌人杀伤在阵地前面，创造了许多以极少伤亡杀伤许多敌军的战例。如十六日在西线涟川西北上浦防、下浦防地区击退敌军一个营进攻的战斗中，我军某部以伤亡七人的代价杀伤敌军一百二十多人。同时，我军在某些地方也向敌军发起小规模的反击战，歼灭了很多敌军。在板门店中立区附近，朝中人民军队坚决打退了敌军多次挑衅性的进攻和窜扰，保卫了朝鲜停战谈判会议区的安全。我海防部队在西海岸进行渡海作战，先后收复了六岛、褚岛、青洋岛、大睡鸭岛、小睡鸭岛等岛屿，盘据在这些岛屿上的敌军都被全部歼灭。
    朝中人民军队高射炮火的增强和人民空军的出动，继续给予美国空军以重大的打击。在高空中飞行的美国B29型重轰炸机和喷气战斗机常常被我地面的火力和空中的火力所击中，美国侵略者现已日益忧虑“空军优势”的丧失。在这一个月中，美国侵略者一面在前线频繁地进行小规模进攻，并指挥李伪军在朝鲜南部向不屈的朝鲜人民进行血腥的大屠杀；一面加紧增调军队、补充兵力和作战物资。但人们可以从侵略军夏季攻势和秋季攻势的惨败中看出：假如美国侵略军敢于再发起大规模的进攻，那么带给它的将是更惨重的失败。
    以下是朝中人民军队十二月份的综合战果：
    一、歼灭敌军九千七百四十六人，其中美军四千一百四十三人、各帮凶国军一百三十六人、李承晚伪军五千四百六十七人。
    二、缴获高射机关炮九门、轻迫击炮一门、六零炮三门、火箭筒两个、火焰喷射器一个、高射机枪两挺、重机枪十七挺、轻机枪二十四挺、自动步枪一百九十三支、卡宾枪六十支、冲锋枪十一支、步马枪四十支、短枪十一支、讯号枪两支、炮弹三千零八十九发、各种子弹十四万八千八百五十一发、手榴弹四千三百十一枚、无线电台三部、步行机五部、对话机九部、无线电话机两部、电话机五部、望远镜八副。
    三、击落击伤敌军飞机三百零九架，其中击落敌机一百七十二架，击伤敌机一百三十七架。击毁击伤敌军战车四十一辆、汽车三十八辆。击毁炮五门。击沉木船九艘。
