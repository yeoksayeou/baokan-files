Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 31, 1951 (TASS dispatch): "Pravda" published an editorial entitled "A Year of Glorious Victory," saying: Today is the last day of 1951. The year that is about to pass is a year marking the fruitful and selfless labor of the Soviet people, and a year marking brilliant new achievements in the struggle for the victory of communism. The Soviet people review the path they have traveled under the leadership of the great Communist Party—the party of Lenin and Stalin—with great satisfaction and patriotic pride. The year that is about to pass also marks further achievements in the Soviet Union's victorious communist construction and the continuous development of all sectors of the national economy.

The victories of the Soviet people in peaceful construction have further strengthened the power of the socialist state and improved the material and cultural living standards of the working people.

The editorial then wrote: The Soviet people have infinitely vast prospects for developing productive forces and creating fruitful material values ​​and spiritual culture. The Party of Lenin and Stalin inspires and organizes the Soviet people to create heroic labor achievements and directs their creativity toward one goal—the victory of communism. The Bolshevik Party is never satisfied with what it has already achieved, it inspires the working people to move forward, to new victories.

The editorial also said: 1951 was a year of further growth and consolidation of socialist and democratic forces around the world. Under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties, the working people of the People's Democratic countries—Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania—are firmly and confidently moving forward along the only correct path—the path of building socialism.

Great democratic reforms are underway in China. Under the leadership of their Communist Party, the Chinese people have consolidated the system of people's democratic dictatorship, and have solved many important economic and political problems in the struggle to break away from the capitalist world economically and become independent, to industrialize the country, and to develop the culture of the masses.

The creativity of the free people, united in the great international camp of socialism and democracy, is entirely used to solve economic and cultural construction problems and to create all conditions for the free and happy life of the working people.

This year has once again shown the infinite vitality of socialism and the inevitable demise of capitalism. In the socialist and democratic camp, the economy and culture are constantly developing, and the living standards of the working people are constantly improving; while in the imperialist camp, external and internal contradictions are becoming increasingly acute, and the vital interests of the broad masses continue to be ruthlessly undermined. Gradual economic collapse, endless increases in prices and taxes, continued increases in the number of unemployed, and frantic expansion of armaments and preparation for another world war—this is what capitalist countries have reaped in 1951. The working people of the main capitalist country—the United States—are welcoming the New Year with a sharp decline in their living standards and the rampant reactionary forces. The people of the Marshallized countries are watching their economic situation further deteriorate. Capitalism plunges millions of working people into poverty and starvation.

The editorial wrote: The ruling groups of capitalist countries, headed by the US imperialists, are pursuing a criminal policy of preparing for another world war, and have already taken overt acts of aggression—organizing bloody intervention in Korea and occupying China's Taiwan Island. Wherever they have the opportunity, the US imperialists establish military bases and piece together aggressive blocs. They are doing everything they can to rush the construction of another slaughterhouse in order to seek profits and strive for world hegemony.

All honest men and women and all those who cherish the progress and freedom of the people are looking up to the Soviet Union, which is marching forward in the forefront of the powerful camp of peace and democracy. Stalin's wise foreign policy—a policy of international peace, security, equality and friendship—is warmly approved and supported by all progressive mankind.

The editorial concluded: The Soviet people are joyfully welcoming the New Year, which will be a year marking glorious new victories in peaceful construction. Under the long-tested leadership of their own Communist Party, and under the wise leadership of the great Stalin, the Soviet working people are confidently marching towards communism.

    光辉胜利的一年
    ——苏联真理报除夕社论的摘要
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科一九五一年十二月三十一日电：“真理报”以“光辉胜利的一年”为题发表社论说：今天是一九五一年的最后一天。即将逝去的一年是标志着苏联人民的收获丰硕的忘我的劳动的一年，是标志着争取共产主义胜利的光辉的新成就的一年。苏联人民怀着极大的满意和爱国的自豪的心情回顾了在伟大的共产党——列宁和斯大林的党——领导下走过的道路。即将逝去的一年还标志着苏联的胜利的共产主义建设中的进一步成就和国民经济一切部门的不断发展。
    苏联人民在和平建设劳动中得到的胜利已进一步加强了社会主义国家的威力，提高了劳动人民的物质与文化生活水准。
    社论接着写道：苏联人民有着发展生产力和创造丰硕的物质价值和精神文化的无限远大的前程。列宁和斯大林的党鼓舞并组织苏联人民创造英雄的劳动业绩，把他们的创造力引向一个目标——共产主义的胜利。布尔什维克党决不满足于已得的成就，它鼓舞劳动人民前进，向新的胜利前进。
    社论又说：一九五一年是全世界社会主义和民主力量进一步壮大和巩固的一年。在共产党和工人党领导下，人民民主国家——波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚——的劳动人民，正在坚定地满怀信心地沿着唯一正确的道路——建设社会主义的道路——向前迈进。
    中华人民共和国国内正在进行伟大的民主改革。中国人民在他们的共产党的领导下，已经巩固了人民民主专政制度，在争取在经济上摆脱资本主义世界而独立、争取国家工业化和人民大众的文化发展的斗争中解决了许多重要的经济—政治问题。
    团结在伟大的国际社会主义和民主阵营中的自由人民的创造力完全用来解决经济和文化建设问题，并为劳动人民的自由和幸福的生活创造一切条件。
    这一年又显示了社会主义的无限充沛的生命力和资本主义的必然灭亡的命运。在社会主义与民主阵营里，经济与文化不断发展，劳动人民的生活水准不断提高；而在帝国主义阵营里，外部和内部矛盾愈来愈尖锐，广大群众的切身利益继续受到无情的摧残。经济逐渐崩溃，物价和赋税漫无止境地增加，大批失业者人数继续增加，疯狂地扩张军备和准备另一次世界大战——这就是资本主义国家在一九五一年的收获。主要资本主义国家——美国——的劳动人民，在他们的生活水准猛烈下降、反动势力猖獗的情况下迎接新年。马歇尔化国家的人民眼看着他们的经济状况进一步地恶化下去。资本主义使千百万劳动人民陷于贫困和饥饿。
    社论写道：以美帝国主义者为首的资本主义国家的统治集团正在奉行准备另一次世界大战的罪恶政策，并已采取了公开的侵略行为——组织在朝鲜的血腥干涉和霸占中国的台湾岛。不论在什么地方，美帝国主义者一有机会就建立军事基地和拼凑侵略集团，他们正在尽一切力量赶制另一个屠宰场，以谋取利润和争取世界霸权。
    所有正直的男女和所有珍视人民的进步和自由的人们都在仰望着在强有力的和平民主阵营的最前列向前迈进的苏联。斯大林的英明的外交政策——国际和平、安全、平等和友好的政策——受到全体进步人类的热烈赞成和拥护。
    社论在结语中写道：苏联人民欢欣鼓舞地迎接新的一年，它将是标志着和平建设劳动中的光辉的新的胜利的一年。苏联劳动人民在他们自己的共产党的久经考验的领导下，在伟大的斯大林的英明领导下，正在满怀信心地向共产主义迈进。
