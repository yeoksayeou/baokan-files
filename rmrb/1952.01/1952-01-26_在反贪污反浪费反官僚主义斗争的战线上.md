Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce Calls on Illegal Merchants to Seize the Opportunity of Suspended Inspections and Quickly Confess

    The Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce convened another mobilization meeting of responsible persons from various industry guilds on the 23rd, calling on all industrialists and merchants in the city to seize the opportunity of the Spring Festival's suspension of inspections and quickly and thoroughly confess all illegal activities such as bribery and tax evasion. Fu Huating, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, pointed out at the meeting: those who refuse to confess have been arrested by the People's Government and will be punished by state law; industrialists and merchants who confess more thoroughly and are willing to repent will receive lenient treatment from the government after investigation. Various industries should find those industrialists and merchants with serious criminal behavior and educate and mobilize them to quickly and thoroughly confess. If these industrialists and merchants remain obdurate and refuse to confess, they can be named to confess; or industry guilds can organize groups to go down and mobilize them. Since the arrest and prosecution of奸商 (crafty merchants) like Liu Yuanjing in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles, members of the construction industry have confessed to some major bribery and tax evasion behaviors, but it is still far from thorough and needs to be deepened further. The hardware, electrical materials, and stationery industries should specify names for confession. The anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in the machinery manufacturing industry has been particularly poor, mainly because the person in charge of this industry association has not confessed his own problems clearly, so he cannot lead the members. This phenomenon must be changed quickly.

Chen Xiyu, President of the People's Bank of China Central South District Branch, and Others Make Preliminary Self-Criticism of Serious Extravagance and Wasteful Behavior

    From October 24 to November 3, 1951, the inspection team of the People's Bank of China held a work summary conference in Kaifeng. Due to the erosion of bourgeois ideology in the minds of leading cadres of the Central South District Branch and the Henan Provincial Branch, the style of showing off "grandeur" and playing "ostentation" grew, and extravagance and waste were very serious during the conference. In order to prepare for this meeting and for the hospitality during the meeting, the Central South District Branch spent 113.79 million yuan, and the Henan Provincial Branch spent 127.99 million yuan, of which 161.88 million yuan was wasted. Regarding this serious extravagance and waste, Chen Xiyu, President of the Central South District Branch, and Vice Presidents He Youqi and Li Shaoyu have made preliminary self-criticisms. In their self-criticisms, they said: "In the past year, due to our gradual infection with the ugly style of the bourgeoisie, we have lost the vigilance we should have in life (actually in thought and politics - editor's note), and the style of showing off 'grandeur' and playing 'ostentation' has grown; especially since July last year, this style has developed even more." In their self-criticisms, they admitted: "The large-scale extravagance and waste in the entire conference arrangement and hospitality were caused by our wrong guiding ideology, and we should bear the main responsibility." They expressed that they will "be vigilant, prevent, and defeat the bourgeoisie's ideological attacks" in the future.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争的战线上
    北京市工商联号召不法商人抓紧暂停检查机会赶快坦白
    北京市工商业联合会在二十三日再次召开了各行业公会负责人的动员大会，号召全市工商业者抓紧春节暂停检查的机会，迅速彻底地坦白一切行贿、偷税等不法行为。市工商联主任委员傅华亭在会上指出：拒不坦白的人，已经被人民政府逮捕，将受到国家法律的制裁；坦白较彻底、愿意悔过自新的工商业者，在查明以后，将得到政府的从宽处理。各行业应当把那些有重大犯罪行为的工商业者找出来，教育动员他们赶快彻底坦白。如果这些工商业者仍然执迷不悟，不肯坦白，可以指名要他们坦白；或者由行业公会组织小组，下去动员劝告他们。北京市工商业界自奸商刘元敬等被逮捕法办后，营造业会员已经坦白了一些较大的行贿、偷税等不法行为，但是仍然很不彻底，还须继续深入一步。五金、电料和纸张文具等业应该指名坦白。机器制造业的反贪污反行贿运动做得特别不好，主要原因是这个行业公会的负责人没有把自己的问题交代清楚，因此无法带动会员，这种现象必须迅速改变。
    人民银行中南区行行长陈希愈等初步检讨严重的铺张浪费行为
    一九五一年十月二十四日至十一月三日，中国人民银行视察团在开封举行总结工作大会，由于中南区行及河南省分行领导干部思想上受了资产阶级思想的腐蚀，滋长了摆“阔气”耍“排场”的风气，会议期间铺张浪费很严重。为了筹备这次会议和在会议期间的招待，中南区行花了一亿一千三百七十九万元，河南省分行花费了一亿二千七百九十九万元，其中浪费了一亿六千一百八十八万元。对于这次严重的铺张浪费，中南区行行长陈希愈、副行长何幼琦、李绍禹已作了初步检讨。他们检讨中说道：“最近一年以来，由于我们逐渐染上资产阶级的丑恶作风，在生活上（其实是思想上、政治上——编者）失去了应有的警惕，滋长了摆“阔气”耍“排场”的风气；特别是从去年七月以后，这种风气更加发展了。”他们在检讨中承认：“在整个会议布置、招待上的大肆铺张浪费，是由于我们错误的指导思想所引起的，应由我们负主要责任。”他们表示今后要“警惕，防止和击退资产阶级思想的进攻。”
