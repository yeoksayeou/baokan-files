Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Central People's Government Ministry of Finance has ordered local tax bureaus that the donations for aircraft and artillery pledged and paid by industrial and commercial businesses in 1951 are permitted to be listed as expenses when calculating the income for the 1951 industrial and commercial income tax. Donations made by individuals in the industrial and commercial sectors, or donations made in the name of industrial and commercial businesses but the donated funds have already been fully allocated into production costs or expenses, as well as donations made with off-book assets that do not involve the profit or loss of the industrial and commercial business, are not permitted to be listed as expenses for the business. For the labor-capital mixed donations from increased production income, the portion belonging to the enterprise's capital side is permitted to be listed as expenses.

    工商业户捐献武器的款项准计算所得税时列为开支
    【新华社三日讯】中央人民政府财政部已命令各地税局，对工商业户在一九五一年内缴纳认捐的飞机大炮捐款，准在征收一九五一年度工商业所得税计算所得额时，列为费用开支。工商界人士以个人名义捐献，或虽以工商业户名义捐献，但所捐献的款项已全部摊入生产成本或开支之内，以及以账外财产捐献不涉及该工商业户盈亏的，都不得列为该业户的费用开支。增产收入的劳资混合捐献，属于企业资方部分的，准予列为费用开支。
