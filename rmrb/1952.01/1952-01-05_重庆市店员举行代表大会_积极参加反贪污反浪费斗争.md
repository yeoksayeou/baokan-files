Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd. Chongqing's shop assistants from various public and private enterprises and shops held a representative meeting from December 25th to 28th last year. The meeting decided to mobilize all shop assistants in the city to actively participate in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

The more than 25,000 shop assistants in Chongqing are an important force in carrying out the struggle against corruption and waste. In the past two years, many shop assistants have assisted the government in fighting against the speculative activities of illegal merchants. For example, when the Municipal People's Government Tax Bureau launched an accounting inspection in August last year, 4,000 shop assistants participated. They provided more than 500 pieces of information, exposing various tricks of illegal merchants to evade taxes, which enabled the smooth completion of the accounting inspection. Since the beginning of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, shop assistants have actively participated. The Southwest China Branch of the State-owned Department Store alone received more than 20 pieces of material exposing corrupt behavior from shop assistants. The meeting decided to establish committees for increasing production and practicing economy under the trade union organizations at all levels to organize and lead shop assistants throughout the city to participate in this movement. The meeting also decided to organize all shop assistants in the city to study relevant documents on increasing production and practicing economy.

    重庆市店员举行代表大会
    积极参加反贪污反浪费斗争
    【新华社重庆二日电】重庆市各公私营企业和商店的店员在去年十二月二十五日至二十八日举行代表大会。大会决定发动全市店员积极参加反对贪污、反对浪费和反对官僚主义运动。
    重庆市两万五千多店员是进行反对贪污、浪费斗争的重要力量。在过去两年中，曾经有不少店员协助政府与不法商人的投机倒把行为进行过斗争。如去年八月份市人民政府税务局开展查账工作时，全市有四千个店员参加，他们提供了五百多件材料，揭穿了许多不法商人的各种逃税漏税的花样，使查账工作顺利完成。这次反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动开始以后，店员们又积极参加。仅国营百货公司西南区公司一个部门从店员中收到检举贪污行为的材料就有二十多件。大会决定按各级工会组织成立增产节约委员会，以组织和领导全市店员参加这一运动。大会并决定组织全市店员学习有关增产节约的文件。
