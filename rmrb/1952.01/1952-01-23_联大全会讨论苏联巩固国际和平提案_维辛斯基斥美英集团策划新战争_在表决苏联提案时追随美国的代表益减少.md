Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 22nd: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the afternoon of the 19th to discuss the Soviet proposal "On Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Consolidate International Peace and Friendship," and voted on the proposal. A noteworthy trend in this vote was the further decrease in the number of delegations following the United States in opposing the Soviet proposal compared to the vote in the Political Committee on the 17th.

At the meeting, the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, delivered a speech vehemently denouncing the despicable attempts of the US-British bloc countries. They tried to force the General Assembly to avoid discussing the substance of the Soviet proposal, namely, demanding that the most important suggestions in the Soviet proposal regarding the prohibition of atomic weapons, disarmament, and the establishment of international supervision be submitted to the Disarmament Commission for consideration, while preventing the General Assembly from passing resolutions on these issues. Vyshinsky said: These countries have exposed that their policies have nothing in common with eliminating the threat of another war and striving for peace. If they were to support peace and oppose war not just with empty words but with action, they should have supported the Soviet proposals on reducing national armaments, ending the Korean War, and banning atomic weapons long ago. But they rejected all these proposals, using the words of peace to adorn themselves, while in reality pursuing aggressive goals and plotting another war.

Vyshinsky pointed out: This session of the General Assembly has once again proved that the policy objectives of the United States and other countries of the North Atlantic Group are to deceive the people and drag them into another war once again. He said: But regardless of all the conspiracies of reactionary forces, the forces of peace are growing stronger day by day. We firmly believe that there is no place on earth where the cause of peace does not attract the hearts of hundreds of millions of people, and where the word "war" is not hated and cursed by all honest people. He finally stated that the Soviet Union will continue to unswervingly pursue its policy of stopping war and defending and consolidating peace. His speech received warm applause from the audience.

The General Assembly first voted on the joint proposal put forward by the United States, Britain, and France. This proposal demanded that items three to seven of the Soviet proposal regarding the prohibition of atomic weapons, disarmament, and the establishment of international supervision be submitted to the Disarmament Commission in order to shelve and bury these suggestions. The majority of the US-British bloc forced the General Assembly to pass their proposal. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against it. Thirteen delegations abstained.

Then, only items one, two, and eight of the Soviet proposal were put to a vote. Five delegations voted in favor of the first Soviet suggestion, which was about declaring participation in the North Atlantic Group and the establishment of military bases on foreign territories as incompatible with the qualifications of UN member states. Forty-five voted against and six abstained.

In voting on the second suggestion regarding the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, regarding the part stipulating an immediate ceasefire, five voted in favor, thirty-five voted against (there were forty-two votes against in the Political Committee), and ten delegations abstained. Regarding the part stipulating that all foreign troops and foreign volunteer forces should withdraw from Korea, seven voted in favor (Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, Yemen), thirty-one voted against (there were forty-two votes against in the Political Committee), and eleven delegations abstained.

When voting on the Soviet suggestion in item eight regarding the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers, eleven countries voted in favor (Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Afghanistan, Burma, Egypt, Yemen, Syria, Saudi Arabia), thirty-one voted against (there were thirty-five votes against in the Political Committee), and eleven delegations abstained.

    联大全会讨论苏联巩固国际和平提案
    维辛斯基斥美英集团策划新战争
    在表决苏联提案时追随美国的代表益减少
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会十九日下午举行全体会议，讨论了苏联“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施”提案，并对这个提案进行了表决。在这次表决中，非常值得注意的趋势是，追随美国而反对苏联提案的代表团，比在十七日政治委员会上进行表决时更加减少了。
    会上，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发言痛斥美英集团国家的卑劣企图。他们想强使大会避不讨论苏联提案的实质，即要求把苏联提案中关于禁止原子武器、裁减军备和建立国际监督的最重要的建议提交裁减军备委员会考虑，而阻止大会对这些问题通过决议。维辛斯基说：这些国家暴露了它们的政策是和消除另一次战争的威胁以争取和平毫无相同之处的。假如他们不是用空话，而是用行动来拥护和平、反对战争，他们就早该支持苏联提出的关于裁减各国军备、结束朝鲜战争、禁止原子武器的建议了。但是他们拒绝了这一切建议，以和平的字眼替自己粉饰，实际上却在追逐侵略的目的，策划另一次战争。
    维辛斯基指出：本届大会再度证明了，美国和北大西洋集团其他各国的政策目的在欺骗人民，把他们再次拖进另一次战争。他说：但是，不顾反动势力的一切阴谋，和平力量的声势正在日益壮大。我们深信，地球上没有这样一个地方，在那里和平事业不是吸引着亿万人民的心，在那里，说出“战争”这个字眼会不受到所有正直人民的憎恨与诅咒。他最后表示，苏联将继续不屈不挠地奉行它的制止战争、保卫与巩固和平的政策。他的发言得到了来自旁听席上的热烈的掌声。
    大会首先就美英法三国所提出的联合提案进行了表决。这个提案要求把苏联提案中关于禁止原子武器、裁减军备和建立国际监督的第三至七项提交裁减军备委员会，以便把这些建议搁起来，埋葬掉。美英集团的多数强使大会通过了它们的这个提案。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克五国代表团投反对票。十三个代表团弃权。
    然后仅就苏联提案中的第一、二、八项进行表决。五个代表团投票赞成苏联建议第一项，这一项是关于宣告参加北大西洋集团和在外国领土上建立军事基地是与联合国会员国的资格不相容的。四十五票反对，六票弃权。
    在表决第二项关于和平解决朝鲜问题的建议时，对于规定立即停战的部分，五票赞成，三十五票反对（在政治委员会中有四十二票反对），十个代表团弃权。对于规定一切外国军队以及外国志愿部队撤出朝鲜的部分，七票赞成（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、埃及、也门），三十一票反对（在政治委员会中有四十二票反对），十一个代表团弃权。
    在表决关于五大国缔结和平公约的苏联建议第八项时，十一个国家投票赞成（苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、阿富汗、缅甸、埃及、也门、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯），三十一票反对（在政治委员会中有三十五票反对），十一个代表团弃权。
