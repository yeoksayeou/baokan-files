    On the Frontline of the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucratism
    Guangzhou Municipal Tax Bureau Conducts In-Depth Inspection
    Cracks Down on Long-Term Collective Tax Evasion in the Liquor Industry
    The Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Tax Bureau recently cracked a long-term collective tax evasion case in the liquor industry. According to preliminary statistics, since liberation, the amount of privately sold liquor produced by the industry's distillers is at least four million jin (approximately two million kilograms), equivalent to half of the total production. The tax evaded from the commodity tax alone is over 11 billion yuan.
    The liquor industry in Guangzhou is a relatively small one, with a total capital of only 4.7 billion yuan, including 68 distillers and 245 liquor vendors. Because the industry is small and scattered, the tax bureau has consistently adopted a fixed-time, fixed-quantity method for assessing commodity taxes on distillers, with additional reporting and tax payment at the end of the month if the quota is exceeded. The distillers exploited the weakness of the tax officials' lack of professional knowledge. Whenever tax personnel came to supervise production, they would reduce the fire by using damp fuel and not replace the cooling water in the stills even when it boiled, thus reducing the output to about half of the original production. The privately produced liquor was not reported or taxed according to regulations. The liquor declared for taxation was also reported as low-proof liquor when it was high-proof, and then they colluded with liquor vendors to conceal it and sell it after diluting it with water. In addition, they used various methods to evade taxes. For example, the invoices were in units of jin, but they paid taxes using "Sima jin" (an old weight system, larger than the standard jin). They reused each invoice several times, called "using it for several meals." Illegal merchants also agreed on secret codes for private sales, such as "bald man" representing private liquor, "man in a suit" representing taxed liquor, and "waste noodles" representing liquor that was half taxed and half untaxed.
    Based on the city's liquor consumption, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Tax Bureau had already detected serious tax evasion in the industry. After a mass tax protection campaign was launched throughout the city in the second half of last year, the Municipal Tax Bureau conducted an in-depth inspection with the active assistance of shop assistants, exposing the secrets of tax evasion in the liquor industry one by one, and mobilizing the industry's manufacturers to confess. Currently, more than 90% of the manufacturers have initially confessed to tax evasion.
    Changsha Industrial and Commercial Circles Launch Confession and Reporting
    Preliminary Discovery of Over 200 Cases of Bribery
    The campaign against bribery and theft of state property in the Changsha industrial and commercial circles, which began at the end of December last year, has now entered the stage of denunciation and confession. From January 6th to 12th, in seven days, manufacturers from 21 industries including construction, weaving and dyeing, hardware, and machinery have initially confessed and reported 210 cases of bribery to the Changsha Industrial and Commercial Circles Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee, with bribes totaling over 180 million yuan, as well as gold, silver dollars, watches, fountain pens, radios, and other items.
    In the Anti-Bribery Campaign in Nanjing's Industrial and Commercial Circles
    Members of the China Democratic National Construction Association Take the Lead
    After the launch of the anti-bribery, anti-fraud, anti-profiteering, and anti-tax evasion campaign in Nanjing's industrial and commercial circles, the preparatory committee of the Nanjing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association held two plenary meetings of all members to mobilize everyone to actively participate in this campaign and to take the lead in promoting it. In addition, they held two members' symposiums to organize members to study. Many members broke down their concerns during the study and examined their illegal activities in the operation of industry and commerce, such as bribery and tax evasion. In total, members confessed and exposed 97 cases of bribery, tax evasion, and other illegal incidents during the study.
    The preparatory committee of the Nanjing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association also sent more than 30 members to participate in the work of the Learning and Promotion Committee for Anti-Bribery, Anti-Fraud, Anti-Profiteering, and Anti-Tax Evasion in the industrial and commercial circles. Member Zhou Tongzhi, while working in the Learning and Promotion Committee, mobilized 16 managers of water and electricity companies to confess to bribery and encroachment on state property in six days.
    Women of All Circles in Chongqing
    Actively Participate in the Anti-Corruption Struggle
    Female staff members and family members of staff members in various agencies and organizations in Chongqing actively advised family members and relatives with corrupt behavior to confess or repent as soon as the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began. They also bravely conducted denunciations. In the Trade Department of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee and its affiliated professional companies alone, there have been more than ten cases of family members of staff members denouncing or advising their husbands with corrupt behavior to confess. Wang Huishan, a female worker at the Municipal Department Store, denounced her husband Xu Zhiliang for embezzling public funds and stealing rubber shoes from the company. Liu Junshan, a staff member of the company, originally only admitted to embezzling a dozen gallons of state gasoline. Due to his wife He Shulong's repeated advice, he finally confessed to embezzling more than 80 gallons in total.
    In the city's various streets, some female residents also reported to the Municipal People's Supervision Committee and various agencies. After women in the industrial and commercial circles participated in the typical denunciation and confession meetings in various industries, many people also realized the serious bribery situation in the industrial and commercial circles. In the automobile transportation, hardware, and liquid fuel industries, there were women who denounced their husbands for bribing government workers and government workers for corruption. All localities should also pay attention to mobilizing the masses of women to participate in the anti-corruption struggle.
    Jilin City Agencies and Enterprises Hold Meetings
    To Denounce Corrupt Elements Who Refuse to Confess
    In order to further mobilize the masses and deepen the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, agencies and enterprises in Jilin City held mass meetings on January 12th. At the meetings, the masses denounced corrupt elements such as Tian Zhenguo, Li Yanhui, Yang Fengshan, and Sun Yuying who refused to confess. The atmosphere at the venue was very tense, and the speakers were very indignant, demanding that these corrupt elements who refused to confess be severely punished. The Jilin City People's Court should accept the demands of the masses and severely punish these corrupt elements who refuse to confess.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争的战线上
    广州市税务局进行深入检查
    破获酒业长期集体偷税案
    广州市人民政府税务局最近破获酒业长期集体偷税案。据初步统计，解放以来该业酿户出卖的私酒最少达四百万市斤，相当于全部产量的一半，偷漏的税款仅货物税一项即在一百一十亿元以上。
    广州市酒业是个较小的行业，全业资金仅四十七亿元，包括酿户六十八家，售酒商二百四十五家。因为行业较小，又很分散，所以税务局对酿户一向采取定时定量的办法稽征货物税，如超过定量时，月终再汇报补税。该业酿户利用税务工作人员业务水平不高的弱点，每当到场监制的时候，便用潮湿的燃料减低火力，酒甑上用来冷却的冷水烧沸了也不更换，这样使产量减低到原来产量的一半左右，等税务工作人员走了，才加工赶制。酿制出来的私酒都不依章补报。报税的酒也把高度酒当低度酒申报，然后和售酒商串通隐瞒，冲水出售。此外还用种种方法偷漏税款。例如发票是以市斤作单位的，但是他们用司马斤（旧衡制，比市斤大）计交。一张发票重用几次，叫做“赶几餐”。不法商人还约定暗号进行私买私卖，如“光头佬”代表私酒，“西装佬”代表有税酒，“废面”代表一半有税一半无税的酒。
    广州市人民政府税务局根据全市酒类消费情况，早已发觉该业有严重的偷漏税款的不法行为。去年下半年全市展开了群众性的护税运动后，市税务局即在店员积极协助下进行了深入检查，把酒业的偷漏秘密一一揭破，并发动该业厂商坦白。目前已有百分之九十以上的厂商初步坦白了偷税行为。
    长沙市工商界展开坦白检举
    初步发现二百多件行贿行为
    长沙市工商界反行贿、反盗窃国家财产运动，自去年十二月底开始以来，现已进入检举和坦白阶段。一月六日到十二日七天中，已有营造、织染、五金、机器等二十一个行业的厂商向长沙市工商界增产节约委员会初步坦白、检举了二百一十件行贿行为，贿赂金额达一亿八千多万元，此外还有黄金、银元、手表、自来水笔、收音机等物品。
    南京市工商界反行贿运动中
    民主建国会会员起带头作用
    南京市工商界开展反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏运动以后，民主建国会南京市分会筹备委员会曾两次召开全体会员大会，动员大家积极参加这一运动，并在运动中起带头推动作用。此外又先后两次举行会员座谈会，组织会员学习。不少会员在学习中打破顾虑，对自己在经营工商业中行贿、偷漏国税等不法行为进行了检查。总计会员们在学习中坦白和揭露出来的行贿、偷漏国税等违法事件共有九十七件。
    民主建国会南京市分会筹委会又派了三十多个会员参加工商界反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏学习推动委员会工作。会员周桐智在学习推动委员会工作时，六天中就动员了十六个水电行的经理坦白了行贿和侵害国家财产的不法行为。
    重庆市各界妇女群众
    积极参加反贪污斗争
    重庆市各机关、团体的女工作人员和工作人员家属在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动一开始，就积极地劝告有贪污行为的家人和亲友迅速坦白或悔过。并勇敢地进行了检举。仅西南军政委员会贸易部和所属几个专业公司，工作人员家属检举或劝告有贪污行为丈夫坦白的就已有十多件。市百货公司女工王惠善检举出她的丈夫徐智良挪用公款、盗窃公司胶鞋的贪污行为。该公司工作人员刘俊山贪污国家汽油，原先只承认有十几加仑。由于他的妻子何书隆的反复劝告，他终于坦白出共贪污过八十多加仑。
    该市各街道，也有些居民妇女向市人民监察委员会及各机关进行检举。工商界妇女参加了各行业的典型检举坦白会议以后，许多人也认识到工商界中的严重行贿情况。汽车运输、五金、液体燃料等行业都有妇女检举自己丈夫行贿和政府工作人员贪污的事情。各地亦应注意发动妇女群众参加反贪污斗争。
    吉林市各机关企业召开大会
    检举拒不坦白的贪污分子
    为了进一步发动群众，深入反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，吉林市各机关、企业在一月十二日，举行了群众大会。会上群众检举了田振国、李延惠、杨凤山、孙毓瑛等拒不坦白的贪污分子。会场空气十分紧张，发言人情绪十分激愤，纷纷要求对这些拒不坦白的贪污分子予以严惩。吉林市人民法院，应接受群众要求，严惩这些拒不坦白的贪污分子。
