    (IV) He studied advanced Soviet logging experience with the workers, devised reasonable logging methods, created many new experiences, and increased the country's wealth.

    (V) The peasants who went to the mountains to work sometimes had low morale. Zhang Ziliang, on the one hand, apologized to them for not fulfilling his responsibilities in the logging equipment and supplies, and promised to improve immediately; on the other hand, he encouraged them to overcome difficulties. The peasants were moved and overfulfilled their tasks.

    (VI) When the logging tasks were tense, he had to run twenty to thirty miles on the waterway every day to check the waterway, organize shock brigades, and launch competitions, so that he was so tired that he could not eat or sleep well.

    （六）在采伐任务紧张的时候，他每天在水道上要跑二三十里路，检查水道，组织突击队，发动竞赛，累得吃不下饭，睡不好觉。
