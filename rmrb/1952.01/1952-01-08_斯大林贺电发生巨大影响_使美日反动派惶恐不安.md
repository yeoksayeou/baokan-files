Xinhua News Agency, January 7th: Japanese bourgeois newspapers admit that Stalin's New Year's telegram to the Japanese people has great significance. American and Japanese reactionaries are feeling uneasy about the telegram's huge impact. According to TASS Tokyo, January 6th: "Yomiuri Shimbun," commenting on Stalin's telegram, pointed out: The telegram has received great attention from the Japanese masses. "Yomiuri Shimbun" said: "Stalin's New Year's greetings to the Japanese people show his magnanimity and impartiality." The newspaper emphasized: "At a time when Japanese newspapers and magazines are filled with articles advocating war, Stalin is calling on the Japanese people to engage in peaceful construction." The newspaper also pointed out that Stalin's telegram is an encouragement to the people to make greater progress.

"Tokyo Times" pointed out the friendly content of the telegram. The newspaper wrote that Stalin's telegram "will have a great impact both domestically and abroad."

"Japan Times" published its unique anti-Soviet remarks. However, it had to admit that the telegram "will inevitably produce a good impression among the Japanese masses," a fact that obviously made it anxious.

Several newspapers published United Press International reports saying that some senior Japanese officials believe that Stalin's expression of friendship toward the Japanese people in the telegram is a matter of particular significance. "Mainichi Shimbun" reported that some Western diplomats are uneasy about the possible impact of the telegram on the Japanese people.

    斯大林贺电发生巨大影响
    使美日反动派惶恐不安
    【新华社七日讯】日本资产阶级报纸承认斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电具有重大的意义，美、日反动派正为这一贺电的巨大影响感到不安。据塔斯社东京六日讯：“读卖新闻”评论斯大林的贺电时指出：贺电受到日本人民大众的极大的注意。“读卖新闻”说：“斯大林向日本人民致新年贺词，这表示他的宽宏大量和毫无偏见。”该报着重指出：“在日本的报章杂志充满鼓吹战争的论文的时候，斯大林呼吁日本人民进行和平的建设。”该报并指出：斯大林的贺电是鼓励人民取得更大的进步。
    “东京时报”指出贺电的友好的内容。这个报纸写道：斯大林的贺电“在日本国内国外都会发生很大”的影响。
    “日本时报”发表了该报特有的反苏的言论。但是它却不得不承认：贺电“必然在日本群众中产生好的印象”，这个事实显然使它惶恐。
    若干报纸发表合众社的消息说：某些日本高级官员认为，斯大林在贺电中表示对日本人民友好，是具有特别意义的一件事。“每日新闻”报道说：某些西方的外交人员对于贺电可能对日本人民发生的影响，感到不安。
