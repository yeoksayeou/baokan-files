(Xinhua News Agency) The Beijing Municipal Committee for Thrift Examination, in order to accommodate the business community's custom of celebrating the Spring Festival, has decided that, starting from the 23rd, inspections of industrial and commercial households will be suspended for ten days until February 1st (Lunar January 5th), with the exception of those currently under inspection and individual industrial and commercial households requiring urgent handling. Inspections will resume on February 2nd.

From January 19th, the Beijing Municipal Committee for Thrift Examination organized over 3,000 people from various military and government agencies, people's organizations, democratic parties, university professors, university students, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, forming hundreds of groups to conduct inspections of illegal industrial and commercial households. As of the 22nd, based on the results of the inspections, the Beijing Municipal People's Government arrested and dealt with according to law the unrepentant illegal merchants Zang Deshan, manager of Deji Paper Store, and Ren Liting, deputy manager of Qingfenghou Fur Shop. In addition, regarding Wu Guozhen, manager of Qihua Construction Company, and Zhang Yongmao, manager of Deyi Lumber Mill, who confessed to major illegal acts and reported other illegal merchants during the inspection team's investigation, the decision was made not to arrest them, but to release them on bail pending further handling.

Zang Deshan, the arrested and prosecuted manager of Deji Paper Store, was the chairman of the Paper and Stationery Trade Association. During the movement, he pretended to be active in an attempt to cover up his various illegal crimes. When Beijing was first liberated, the store's total capital was only a few dozen reams of paper. In the three years since, as a result of Zang's illegal means of enticing cadres to steal national economic intelligence and obtain materials, the store's traceable capital has reached over 600 million yuan. According to preliminary statistics, the store underreported its business volume by over 1.776 billion yuan, and the amount of tax evaded was substantial. In order to achieve his goal of stealing state property, Zang had been bribing cadres since 1949, with confirmed bribes amounting to over 20 million yuan. At the beginning of this movement, Zang avoided the important issues and only confessed to bribing 4 to 5 million yuan. When the inspection team arrived at the store, Zang initially put on airs, shouting slogans of confessing problems without discussing specific materials. Later, when he realized that he could not deceive them, he resorted to gangster tactics, saying, "I have confessed everything." Ren Liting, the arrested and prosecuted deputy manager of Qingfenghou Fur Shop, was a consistently unscrupulous merchant who bribed cadres to steal state property. According to the materials already uncovered, the perpetrator had successively bribed a total of over 9 million yuan. Ren colluded with cadres of the Livestock Products Company, stealing state property of over 336 million yuan by "increasing prices" and "increasing weight" when selling wool to the company. In addition, the perpetrator created false accounts, colluded with tax bureau cadres, and evaded taxes of over 173 million yuan. At the beginning of this movement, Ren pretended to confess while convening meetings with store employees, attempting to suppress accusations. When the inspection team arrived at the store, Ren remained cunning and denied everything, refusing to confess.

Wu Guozhen, manager of Qihua Construction Company, whom the People's Government ordered to be released on bail pending lenient treatment, had bribed government cadres. In the process of contracting projects, he obtained exorbitant profits of over 600 million yuan by underreporting quantities and cutting corners, causing a loss of over 820 million yuan to state property. After this movement began, Wu Guozhen only confessed to some minor matters, without mentioning major issues such as stealing state property. When the inspection team arrived at the factory, he expressed his willingness to repent and gradually confessed his illegal acts and reported others. Zhang Yongmao, manager of Deyi Lumber Mill, who was also granted lenient treatment and released on bail without arrest, had bribed cadres by issuing false invoices and other means, stealing state property and evading state taxes. After this movement began, Zhang Yongmao did not voluntarily confess his illegal acts. When the inspection team went to inspect, after several days of mobilization by the inspection team, he admitted to bribing over 16 million yuan. The loss of state property due to cutting corners amounted to 60 million yuan.

Since the start of the anti-corruption, anti-bribery movement in the Beijing business community on December 25th of last year, the Beijing Municipal Committee for Thrift Examination had extended the inspection period four times in response to requests from the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, giving industrial and commercial operators with illegal activities who were willing to repent the opportunity to confess thoroughly. In the three days from the 12th of this month, when the Beijing Municipal Committee for Thrift Examination first began its inspection, the Beijing Municipal People's Government arrested eleven illegal merchants, including Liu Yuanjing and Cao Bulin, which made many illegal industrial and commercial operators realize that failing to confess thoroughly would inevitably lead to their own downfall. Therefore, on the 16th, when the Beijing Municipal Committee for Thrift Examination once again responded to the request of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and decided to suspend inspections for three days, during the fourth extension of the confession period, the materials of confession and reporting by the business community increased significantly. On the 18th alone, there were more than 15,000 cases, and the problems confessed were also somewhat larger. The problem of cutting corners in the construction industry, which had been unwilling to reveal in the past, also began to be confessed. Banks, money shops, trade and other industries also began to confess some illegal acts such as speculation in gold and silver, tax evasion, and illegal purchase of state foreign exchange. However, many illegal industrial and commercial operators still did not confess thoroughly at this time. Therefore, when the fourth extension of the confession period expired, the Municipal Committee for Thrift Examination launched a large-scale inspection of industrial and commercial households in the business community with illegal activities. At the same time, it dealt with the illegal industrial and commercial households identified in the previous stage of inspection according to their respective situations, arresting three illegal merchants who refused to confess, including Wu Runmin, manager of Central Typewriter Shop, and Zhang Jingfan, manager of Mingchang Photographic Materials Shop; Bian Lanpo, manager of Baofeng Paper Shop, who confessed better during the inspection, was not arrested but was released on bail pending further handling.

    北京市节约检查委员会决定
    暂停检查十天照顾工商界过春节
    拒不坦白的奸商臧德山、任礼亭已被逮捕法办
    【新华社讯】北京市节约检查委员会为了照顾工商业界过春节的习惯，决定自二十三日起对工商业户除正在进行检查者及亟待处理的个别工商户仍继续检查外，其他暂停检查十天，延期至二月一日为止（旧历一月五日）·二月二日起将继续进行检查。
    北京市节约检查委员会从一月十九日起，组织北京各军政机关、人民团体、民主党派、大学教授、大学学生、工商业联合会等三千多人，组成几百个小组分头对不法工商业户进行检查。到二十二日止，北京市人民政府根据检查的结果，又将坚不坦白的不法奸商德记纸行经理臧德山、庆丰厚皮毛栈副经理任礼亭二犯逮捕法办。另对在这次检查组进行检查时，还肯坦白重大的犯法行为并检举其他不法奸商的启华营造厂经理吴国桢、德义木厂经理张永茂二人，决定不予逮捕，令其具保听候处理。
    被逮捕法办的德记纸行经理臧德山是纸张文具业同业公会的主任委员，在运动中假装积极，企图掩护其各种不法罪行。该店在北京刚解放时，全部资金仅数十令纸，三年以来，因为臧犯用勾引干部盗取国家经济情报、套购物资等不法手段大量盗窃国家资财的结果，到现在该店仅有账可查的资金就达六亿多元。据初步统计，该店少报营业额就有十七亿七千六百多万元，偷税漏税款额很大。臧犯为了达到窃取国家财产的目的，从一九四九年以来即不断向干部行贿，据已查明者已达两千多万元。这次运动开始时，臧犯避重就轻，只交代行贿四、五百万元。臧犯在这次检查组到该店检查时，最初装腔作势，空喊交代问题，不谈具体材料。以后见欺骗不了时，竟耍流氓手段说：“我已全部交代清了。”被逮捕法办的庆丰厚皮毛栈副经理任礼亭是一个一贯贿赂干部盗窃国家财产的奸商。据已查出的材料，该犯先后行贿共九百多万元。任犯曾勾结畜产公司干部，在卖给该公司羊毛时以“加价”、“加分量”的办法窃取国家财产三亿三千六百多万元。另外，该犯造假账，拉拢税务局干部，偷税一亿七千三百多万元。在这次运动开始时，任犯一面假坦白，一面召集店员开会，企图压制检举。检查组到该店进行检查时，任犯仍然狡猾抵赖，坚不坦白。
    人民政府令其取保听候从宽处理的启华营造厂经理吴国桢，曾向机关干部行贿，在包工过程中，以少报多，偷工减料，获得暴利六亿多元，使国家财产损失达八亿二千多万元。此次运动展开后，吴国桢仅坦白了一些小事情，对盗骗国家资财等大问题一点没有交代。当检查组到该厂检查时，他表示愿意悔过自新，陆续把自己的不法行为坦白了出来，并检举了别人。另一为政府从宽处理取保听候处理、未加逮捕的德义木厂经理张永茂，他曾以开假发货票等方式向干部行贿，盗骗国家资财，偷漏国家税款。在这次运动开始后，张永茂未自动坦白他的不法行为。到检查组前往检查时，经过检查组的几天动员，承认了曾行贿一千六百多万元。因偷工减料致国家财产遭受损失达六千万元。
    北京市工商界反贪污、反行贿运动，自去年十二月二十五日开始以来，北京市节约检查委员会曾前后四次应北京市工商业联合会的请求延期检查，给予有不法行为而愿意悔过自新的工商业者以彻底坦白的机会。在本月十二日起，北京市节约检查委员会第一次开始检查的三天中，曾由北京市人民政府逮捕了不法奸商刘元敬、曹步林等十一名后，这使许多不法工商业者认识了不彻底坦白必将自食恶果，因此在十六日北京市节约检查委员会再次应工商业联合会的请求，决定停止检查三天，第四次展延坦白期限中，工商业界坦白检举的材料有显著增加，仅十八日一天就有一万五千多件，同时交代的问题也有些是较大的。营造业过去不大肯吐露的偷工减料问题，也开始坦白了。银行、钱庄、贸易等行业也开始交代了一些捣卖金银、偷税、套购国家外汇等不法行为。但是，仍有不少不法工商业者在此时还没有彻底坦白。因此，当第四次延展坦白期限届满后，市节约检查委员会即对工商界中有不法行为的工商业户展开大规模的检查。同时，并对在前一阶段检查中查明的不法工商业户分别情况，作了处理，计逮捕了拒不坦白的中央打字机行经理吴润民、明昌照像材料行经理张景繁等三名奸商；对在检查时坦白较好的宝丰纸行经理边岚坡，未予逮捕，令其取保听候处理。
