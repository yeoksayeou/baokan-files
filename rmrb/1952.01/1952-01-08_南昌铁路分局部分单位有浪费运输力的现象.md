    Waste of Transport Capacity in Some Units of Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau

    Comrade Editor: Some units under the Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau are wasting transport capacity in their use of vehicles. For example, after train 481 arrived at Pingxiang Station on November 15th last year, it was unreasonably delayed for ninety-two hours, wasting more than 3.8 million yuan. On December 6th last year, after a locomotive arrived at Pingxiang Station, the inspector determined that the locomotive needed to be sent to Nanchang for repair, but it remained there until the 14th before it was hauled away. The locomotive was delayed for a total of one hundred and eighty-six hours, wasting more than 7.8 million yuan. On December 11th and 12th last year, after locomotives arrived at Quanjiao Station, due to a lack of planning on the part of the dispatchers, the vehicle usage time was wasted, resulting in a total loss of more than 22.4 million yuan in two instances. The main reasons for the waste are that the leading cadres of these units are complacent, believing they have saved a lot compared to the past; in addition, their work lacks planning and they do not adequately inspect their work. They only know how to complete tasks, but are unwilling to carefully calculate the costs.

    南昌铁路分局部分单位有浪费运输力的现象
    编辑同志：南昌铁路分局部分单位在车辆使用上有浪费现象。比如去年十一月十五日，四八一次车到萍乡车站以后，无故停留了九十二小时，计浪费三百八十多万元。去年十二月六日，机车到萍乡车站后，检车员检查结果，认为须把机车送南昌修理，但一直停留到十四日才把机车挂走。机车共停留一百八十六小时，浪费了七百八十多万元。去年十二月十一、十二日，机车到泉江车站后，先后因调度方面毫无计划，浪费了车辆使用时间，两次共损失二千二百四十多万元。造成浪费的主要原因是这些单位领导干部自以为比过去节省了许多，产生了自满情绪；另外是他们的工作无计划和对工作检查不够。他们只知完成任务，却不肯仔细算账。
