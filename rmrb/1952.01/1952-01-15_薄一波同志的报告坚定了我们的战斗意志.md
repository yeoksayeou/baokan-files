    Comrade Bo Yibo's Report Strengthened Our Fighting Will
    After reading Comrade Bo Yibo's report "Striving for a Deep and Universal Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement," I was truly excited! Chairman Mao's brilliance and greatness, and the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, have ensured that our motherland is advancing at all times.

    Our three major movements of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, Land Reform, and Suppressing Counter-revolutionaries have already won decisive victories, and have smashed the deeply rooted foundations of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in our country. These are fierce battles. These battles are arduous, but it is relatively easy to concentrate firepower, aim at the enemy, and completely annihilate them.

    But this time is different. Corruption, waste, and bureaucratic elements are hidden within us, easily dazzling us and making it difficult to find targets. As Comrade Bo Yibo pointed out: "If we cannot win a decisive victory on this front, we cannot guarantee the victory of the revolution, nor can we guarantee the smooth progress of national construction. This is a great political and economic struggle that concerns the overall situation."

    Comrade Bo Yibo's report gave detailed instructions on the analysis of the situation, the favorable conditions for our operations, and the deployment of strategies and tactics. Therefore, it further strengthened our fighting will and inspired our confidence in victory.

    Chairman Mao called on us: to win victory on this newly opened front—the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. I believe this prediction will soon become a reality.

    薄一波同志的报告坚定了我们的战斗意志
    我读了薄一波同志“为深入地普遍地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动而斗争”的报告以后，真是太兴奋了！毛主席的英明伟大，中国共产党和中央人民政府领导的正确，使我们的祖国无时无刻不在前进。
    我们的抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动，已经赢得了决定性的胜利，打垮了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在我国根深柢固的基础。这是激烈的战斗。这些战斗，是艰苦的，但比较容易集中火力，瞄准敌人，把它彻底歼灭干净。
    可是这次不同了。贪污、浪费、官僚主义分子是隐蔽在我们内部，容易使我们眼花缭乱，难以发现目标。诚如薄一波同志所指出的：“如果在这个战线上面我们不能够取得决定性的胜利，我们就不能保证革命的胜利，就不能保证国家建设事业的顺利进行。这是一场关系全局的伟大的政治斗争和经济斗争。”
    薄一波同志这个报告，对于情况的分析，对于我们作战的有利条件，以及战略战术的布置，都作了详尽的指示，因此，更坚定了我们战斗的意志，鼓舞了我们胜利的信心。
    毛主席号召我们：要在新开辟的这一条战线上——反贪污，反浪费，反官僚主义的斗争上，取得胜利。我相信这个预言会很快成为事实。
