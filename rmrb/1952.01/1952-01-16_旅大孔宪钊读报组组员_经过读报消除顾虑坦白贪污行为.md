    Eliminate Concerns and Confess Embezzlement After Reading the Newspaper
    Comrade Editor: We began the movement against corruption, degeneration, and bureaucracy last September. Initially, many people had ideological concerns about this movement. They worried that if they confessed their embezzlement, superiors would not trust them, and comrades would look at them differently. Some people thought they were clean and took a laissez-faire attitude towards the movement. Later, after reading the documents and various examples about policies and guidelines published in the newspaper, these ideological concerns were gradually dispelled. Comrade Jiang Enfang confessed in the reading group that he had over-reimbursed expenses such as long-distance telephone calls and hotel stays when he went to Shenyang on business last year. Comrade Ningbo revealed that he had embezzled seven hundred catties of grain when he went to the countryside to collect public grain the year before last. Comrade Qu Congxiao exposed his own corrupt and degenerate thoughts. He said, "Without this study, my future would be very dangerous. If I had the opportunity, I might have embezzled."

    经过读报消除顾虑坦白贪污行为
    编辑同志：去年九月间，我们就开始了反对贪污蜕化、反对官僚主义运动。最初，不少人对这个运动有思想顾虑。他们担心坦白了自己的贪污行为，上级就会不相信自己，同志们就要另眼看待自己。有些人认为自己清白，就对这个运动采取自由主义的态度。以后读了报纸上刊登的有关政策、方针的文件和各种事例，逐渐解除了这些思想顾虑。姜恩芳同志在读报组里坦白了他去年到沈阳办事，多报销了长途电话、住旅馆等项费用；宁波同志说出了他前年下乡征收公粮时，贪污了七百斤粮食。曲从晓同志揭发了自己的腐化堕落的思想。他说：“不经过这次学习，我的前途是非常危险的。如果有机会的话，我就可能发生贪污行为的。”
