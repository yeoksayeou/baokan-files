    Our Great Motherland
    The Chinese people spent 1951 in great victory and entered 1952. On this day last year, the great Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army were breaking through the 38th parallel, pursuing the enemy in victory, and winning significant victories. This is the morning of New Year's Day last year, the Chinese People's Volunteers, having broken through the 38th parallel, are toasting Chairman Mao's health with snow as wine.

    我们伟大的祖国
    中国人民在伟大的胜利中度过了一九五一年而进入一九五二年。去年今日，伟大的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军正突破三八线，乘胜追击敌人，赢得了重大的胜利。这是去年元旦的早晨，突破了三八线的中国人民志愿军，正以雪代酒为毛主席的健康而干杯。
