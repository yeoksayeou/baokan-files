Universally Launch the Struggle Against Corruption and Bribery in the Industrial and Commercial Sectors

I. The Anti-Corruption Struggle Is Closely Related to the Industrial and Commercial Sectors

Recently, industrial and commercial circles in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing have launched a vigorous campaign to expose and confess corruption and bribery. This movement is an important part of the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. This movement should be carried out in all cities across the country. Industrialists, businesspeople, shop assistants, workers, and people from all walks of life across the country should actively participate in this movement.

As everyone knows, the national industrial and commercial sectors have shown good performance in the patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Many industrialists and businesspeople enthusiastically donated airplanes and cannons, and actively paid national taxes, which is a good aspect. However, on the other hand, industrialists and businesspeople have ideas of prioritizing profit, harming others for self-interest, speculation, and disregard for the interests of the country and the people. The most prominent manifestation of this is that many of them try every means to bribe certain staff members to achieve the purpose of stealing national wealth. At the same time, the phenomena of tax evasion and reduction of materials and workmanship in processing orders for the country are also common and serious in the industrial and commercial sectors.

A large proportion of major cases discovered in the anti-corruption movement in various places are related to the industrial and commercial sectors. Many illegal industrialists and businesspeople try every possible means to lure cadres into corruption. To give an example: Wu Yong, a cadre of the Benxi Coal and Iron Company in Northeast China, participated in the revolutionary work in the Jidong Anti-Japanese Base Area in 1939. However, he could not resist the temptation of奸商（unscrupulous merchants）. When he worked in Shenyang, he met a merchant who initially invited him to movies and restaurants. Later, he sent overcoats and watches. When Wu Yong refused, the奸商（unscrupulous merchants） secretly put the watch in his pocket. When Wu Yong's child was sick, the merchant took him to see a doctor, and a large roll of banknotes was found in the child's pocket when he returned. In this way, Wu Yong was gradually bribed and deteriorated. Later, the奸商（unscrupulous merchants） forced Wu Yong to help them steal national wealth: "If you don't do it, I will report you!" In this way, Wu Yong accepted 6 million yuan in bribes, but the奸商（unscrupulous merchants） stole more than 1 billion yuan of the country and the people's wealth.

There are many such examples. As for the phenomenon of sending "kickbacks" to staff members who purchase goods in stores, lending money, and giving gifts, it is even more common. Therefore, if the path of bribery by industrialists and businesspeople can be blocked now, it will play a significant role in thoroughly eliminating corruption.

II. Confession and Repentance Are the Only Way Out for Lawbreaking Industrialists and Businesspeople

Bo Yibo, Director of the Central People's Government's Thrift Inspection Committee, clearly pointed out: "Bribing state personnel, evading taxes, stealing state property by various fraudulent methods when trading with the state, reducing workmanship and materials when undertaking state-entrusted processing, undertaking orders or undertaking construction projects, reporting low prices as high, using bad as good, and stealing economic intelligence from state personnel, etc., are all despicable practices left over from the old society, are criminal acts that violate the laws and disciplines of the new China, and are absolutely intolerable to the People's Government." Director Bo Yibo also clarified the policy to industrialists and businesspeople: "Industrialists and businesspeople who have the above-mentioned illegal behaviors should truthfully confess to the government, publicly declare their repentance, and guarantee that the same mistakes will not occur in the future. For industrialists and businesspeople who violate the law, except for those who are extremely heinous, those who can automatically and thoroughly confess can also be given a reduction or exemption of punishment depending on the circumstances. All tax evasion and tax evasion must be stopped. Those who have evaded or leaked taxes should pay the arrears, and those who do not confess should not only pay the arrears but also be punished." It is very clear that only a thorough confession is the only way out for all lawbreaking industrialists and businesspeople.

Some lawbreaking industrialists and businesspeople may think this way: Isn't confessing going to lose face and be punished? However, if you don't confess, and you are found out and reported in the future, won't you lose even more face and be subjected to more severe punishment? This great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy will be carried out vigorously and resolutely throughout the country. All acts of corruption and bribery will be thoroughly investigated. Bribery and accepting bribes are two-sided matters. If you don't speak, the person who accepted the bribe will speak. There is no way that others will not know about bribery, tax evasion, and cutting corners. If you don't confess, others will report you. In this anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement, some people who accepted and gave bribes had originally made an "offensive and defensive alliance", agreeing "not to say anything"; later, one party became enlightened, confessed first, and reduced their guilt; while the other party was still daydreaming, thinking that "no one knows." There are already many such examples. In the past few days alone, the industrial and commercial circles in Beijing have confessed and reported more than 5,400 bribery-related materials (statistics as of January 9); shop assistants in Tianjin have reported more than 11,000 cases of corruption, bribery, and tax evasion in six days; there are also many materials from cadres in various organs and people from all walks of life confessing and reporting. All lawbreaking industrialists and businesspeople should wake up! They should confess thoroughly as soon as possible. They should know that no matter what, they cannot escape the eyes of the tens of millions of people.

III. Shop Assistants, Workers, and People From All Walks of Life Should Participate in the Fight Against Corruption and the Struggle Against Bribery

When carrying out the anti-corruption and anti-bribery struggle in the industrial and commercial sectors, patriotic industrialists and businesspeople should, of course, stand up to expose the corruption and bribery of others, and people from all walks of life should also stand up to expose them. In particular, shop assistants and workers should stand at the forefront of this movement. Shop assistants and workers are part of the country's leading class and the masters of the country. How can everyone tolerate their country suffering losses? In this movement, shop assistants and workers in many places have shown the spirit of being masters of the country. They actively expose the illegal behaviors of their bosses that they know about, or persuade their bosses to confess. Fan Xingshi, a shop assistant at the Huitong Warehouse in the Sixth District of Beijing, refused the 3 million or 5 million yuan bribes from the capitalists and exposed the capitalist's illegal behavior. Li Taiyun, a worker at the private Yifeng Rice Mill in Chongqing, personally went to Chongqing's state-owned grain company to expose the crime of a staff member of the company colluding with the boss of their rice mill to steal and sell state materials. In Beijing, Tianjin, and other places, some illegal industrialists and businesspeople have played many conspiracies and tricks against shop assistants and workers who want to report them, such as giving shop assistants and workers some small favors, inviting shop assistants and workers to dinner, talking about "friendship," pulling "hometown relationships," and so on. Some even found the families or introducers of the shop assistants and workers to persuade them not to confess. Some even used intimidation, deception, and other means. However, many shop assistants did not care about their tricks, did not fall for their tricks, and bravely went to report. At the same time, many peddlers, street residents, and housewives in Beijing stood up to expose corruption and bribery elements. Two students in Tianjin reported their fathers. These people's patriotic actions have been praised by people from all walks of life. Shop assistants and workers and people from all walks of life across the country should learn from them.

In addition, some shop assistants and workers have been deceived and蒙蔽（hoodwinked） by the capitalists in the past and have gained a little "benefit." Now they dare not speak out. These people should think clearly: Exposing the illegal behavior of the capitalists earlier shows that they were deceived in the past. If they help the boss conceal it, they will also be breaking the law, failing the country and the people, and they will be implicated if they are reported by others in the future.

### 普遍展开工商界的反贪污反行贿斗争

专栏：宣传员讲话

    普遍展开工商界的反贪污反行贿斗争
    一、反贪污斗争和工商界有很大的关系
    最近北京、天津、上海、重庆等城市的工商界，都大张旗鼓地展开了一个反贪污、反行贿的检举坦白运动。这个运动，是伟大的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的一个重要环节。全国所有城市都要开展这个运动。全国的工商业者、店员、工人和其他各界人民，都应该积极地参加这个运动。
    大家知道，全国工商界在抗美援朝爱国运动中曾有好的表现。许多工商业者热烈捐献飞机大炮、踊跃交纳国税等，这是好的一方面；但是另一方面，工商业者们具有唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧、不顾国家和人民的利益的思想。这方面表现得最突出的，就是他们中的许多人千方百计地向某些工作人员行贿，来达到窃盗国家财富的目的。同时，工商界中的偷税漏税、给国家加工订货时偷工减料的现象也很普遍而且严重。
    各地在反贪污运动中发现的重大案件，很大部分都和工商界有关系。有许多不法的工商业者，想尽种种办法来引诱干部去贪污。举一个例子说：东北本溪煤铁公司有一个干部叫吴勇，一九三九年就在冀东抗日根据地参加了革命工作。但他却经不起奸商的引诱。他在沈阳工作时，遇上一个商人，开始请他看电影、上馆子。后来又送大衣、手表，吴勇不要，奸商就把手表偷偷地放在他的口袋里。吴勇的孩子病了，商人带他去治病，回来时小孩口袋里发现一大卷钞票。这样，吴勇就一步一步受贿变了质。以后，奸商们就强迫吴勇帮他们偷盗国家的财富：“你不搞，我要去告发！”就这样，吴勇受了六百万元贿赂，奸商们却盗取了国家和人民十亿多元的财富。
    这样的例子很不少，至于商店里给采买东西的工作人员送“回扣”，借钱、送礼等现象，那就更普遍。所以现在如果能把工商业者行贿的这条路子堵死，这对于彻底肃清贪污现象是有很大作用的。
    二、坦白悔过是犯法工商业者的唯一出路
    中央人民政府节约检查委员会薄一波主任曾明确指出：“贿赂国家工作人员，偷税漏税，在和国家进行交易时用各种欺骗方法盗窃国家资财，在承受国家委托加工、承受订货或承受修建工程时偷工减料，以贱报贵，以坏作好，以及从国家工作人员手中盗窃经济情报等等，都是旧社会遗留下来的卑劣作风，是违反新中国法纪的罪恶行为，是人民政府所绝对不能容许的。”薄一波主任又向工商业者讲清了政策：“凡属有上述犯法行为的工商业者，应当据实向政府坦白，公开声明悔过，保证以后不再发生同样的错误。政府对于犯法的工商业者，除罪大恶极者外，凡能自动彻底坦白的，也可以视情况酌予减罪或免罪。一切偷税漏税的行为，必须制止。已偷漏者应补交，不坦白者补交之外，并应受罚。”十分明白，只有彻底坦白，才是一切犯法的工商业者唯一的一条出路。
    有一些犯法的工商业者会这样想，坦白出来不是要丢面子，受惩罚吗？但是，你不坦白，将来被查出来，被检举出来，不是要更加丢面子，受更严重的惩罚吗？这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争，是全国各地都要大张旗鼓地雷厉风行地进行的。一切贪污行贿行为都会被查个水落石出。行贿受贿是两方面的事情，你不说，受贿的人会说。行贿、偷税漏税、偷工减料等事，没有不被别人知道的，你不坦白，别人会给你检举。在这次反贪污反行贿运动中，有些受贿行贿的人原先订过“攻守同盟”，约定“都不说”；后来一方觉悟了，先坦白出来了，减轻了罪过；而另一方面还在胡思乱想，自以为“人不知、鬼不觉”。这样的例子已经很不少了。最近这些天，光只北京市工商界就坦白检举了行贿材料五千四百多件（一月九日止的统计）；天津市的店员们在六天内就检举了贪污、行贿、偷税等案一万一千多件；各地机关干部和各界人民检举坦白的材料还有许多。一切犯法的工商业者都应该醒过来了！应该早早彻底坦白。应该知道，无论怎样，是逃不脱千万双人民群众的眼睛的。
    三、店员工人和各界人民都来参加反对贪污
    反对行贿的斗争
    在工商界中开展反贪污反行贿斗争的时候，爱国的工商业者固然应该起来检举别人的贪污、行贿，其他各界人民也应该起来检举，特别是店员工人们，应该站在这个运动的最前线。店员工人是国家的领导阶级的一部分，是国家的主人翁，大家怎能容忍自己的国家遭受损失呢？许多地方的店员工人在这次运动中表现了国家主人翁的气概。他们积极检举他们所知道的老板们的不法行为，或者劝老板去坦白。北京市第六区惠通栈的店员工人范兴实，拒绝资方给他三百万、五百万的贿赂，把资方的犯法行为检举出来了。重庆市私营益丰米厂的工人李泰运，亲自跑到重庆的国营粮食公司去检举公司的一个职员和他们米厂的老板勾结盗卖国家物资的罪行。在北京、天津等地，还有一些不法的工商业者，对要检举他们的店员工人耍了许多阴谋诡计，如给店员工人一些小恩小惠，请店员工人吃饭，讲“交情”，拉“同乡关系”等等。有的还找店员工人的家属或介绍人去劝阻店员工人不要去坦白。有的甚至使用恐吓、欺骗等手段。但是，许多店员没有管他们这一套，没有上他们的当，勇敢地去进行了检举。同时，北京有许多摊贩、街道居民和家庭妇女，都起来检举贪污、行贿分子。天津有两个学生检举了自己的父亲。这些人的爱国举动，受到了各界人民的赞扬。全国各地的店员工人和各界人民，都应该向他们学习。
    另外，还有一些店员工人，过去受了资方的欺骗蒙蔽，得了一点小“好处”，现在自己不敢讲。这些人应该想清楚：早些去检举了资方的不法行为，正表示自己过去是受了欺骗。如果自己帮助老板隐瞒，也就犯了法，对不起国家和人民，将来被别人检举出来，更要连累自己。
