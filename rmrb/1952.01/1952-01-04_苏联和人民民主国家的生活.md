Editor's Note: In order to allow our readers to better understand various aspects of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, in addition to regularly publishing important news and lengthy articles about our fraternal countries on this page, we have decided to add a "Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries" column, which will be published every other day. This column will reflect the actual conditions of the political, economic, literary, artistic, and scientific lives of the people of various fraternal countries in the form of concise reports, newsletters, and comprehensive introductions.

	On the Volga River, near Stalingrad
	1951 was a period of preparation for the construction of one of the glorious constructions of communism - the Stalingrad Hydropower Station. The builders worked hard, completing their annual plan in August, and since September they have been working on the 1952 tasks.
	In 1950, construction began on the 600-kilometer-long Stalingrad Free-Flow Canal, which will connect the Volga and Ural rivers. The canal water will bring life to the semi-desert areas. Excavation work on the Volga-Akhtuba Canal also began at the same time.
	In 1951, a new city was built for the builders. The first batch of neat and comfortable stone houses has already been inhabited. A club, hospital, public dining hall and shops were built in the city. The city was also greened.
	1952 is a year of tremendous work for us to build the basic links of the hydropower station. In 1952, the scale of construction and assembly work will increase four times compared to 1951.
	The entire cause and thought of all our staff is how to start generating electricity at the Stalingrad Hydropower Station on the Volga River as soon as possible, so that the grasslands along the Volga River can get the life-giving moisture. We are building for the happiness of the people!
	(Written by Medvedev, Chief Engineer of the Stalingrad Hydropower Station and winner of the Stalin Prize)

	New Reinforcements for Industrial Production in Czechoslovakia
	In 1951, in order to reduce administrative costs, eliminate bureaucratic work style, and also due to the urgent need for manpower in factories and enterprises, the Czechoslovak government decided to transfer 77,500 office workers to production posts. By the end of September 1951, 63,963 office workers had left their offices and gone to factories or construction sites.
	The transfer of office workers has added new production reinforcements to the factories, allowing for two or three shifts to be implemented. Originally, due to lack of manpower, valuable machines had to be idle for eight to sixteen hours a day, but this situation changed after office workers transferred to factories, and production costs will be reduced as a result, and production will increase greatly. On the other hand, work efficiency will also be improved in the offices and a large amount of administrative expenses will be saved.
	What would an office worker feel like when he goes to a factory? Antoni Masek left his original profession in June 1951, and after six weeks of study in a training class, became a lathe worker at the Stalingrad Factory in Prague. After working for a period of time, Masek said: "People who have never been to a factory will not understand that a skilled worker, like an artist, feels satisfied with real creation. The worker's profession requires creative thinking and the ability to make quick decisions. Most new workers have discovered that machines have a magic that they never thought of."

	Unveiling of the Stalin Monument in Hungary
	On December 16, 1951, the "J. V. Stalin" monument was solemnly unveiled in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. This unveiling ceremony was a grand festival for the working people of Budapest, and at the same time, it was a moving testament to the Hungarian people's respect and loyalty to the great Stalin.
	From early morning, Budapest residents carrying portraits of Stalin, the flag of the Hungarian People's Republic and red flags gathered towards the city center. The bronze statue of Stalin, the leader of the world's working people, standing eight meters high on a red stone base, was erected there.
	More than 50,000 people participated in the gathering. Standing on the rostrum were Rakosi, Gro, Chairman Ronai of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, Chairman Dobi of the Council of Ministers, members of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, and government leaders.
	The meeting was addressed by Rivai, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party. He pointed out that the liberation and achievements of the Hungarian people are inseparable from the name of the great Stalin.
	Finally, when he congratulated Comrade Stalin on his health and longevity, the masses at the meeting unanimously shouted "Long live Stalin!" "May Stalin live forever!"

专栏：

    苏联和人民民主国家的生活
    编者按：为了使我国读者更多地了解苏联和人民民主国家的各方面情况，我们除了在本版经常刊登有关我们的兄弟国家的各项要闻及长篇文章以外，决定增辟“苏联和人民民主国家的生活”专栏，每隔日发表一次。本栏将以简明的报道、通讯和综合介绍等形式，反映各兄弟国家人民的政治、经济、文学艺术和科学生活的实况。
    在伏尔加河上，在斯大林格勒附近
    一九五一年是共产主义光荣的建筑之一——斯大林格勒水电站建筑的准备工作时期。建筑者们紧张地劳动着，在八月份他们就完成了全年计划，而从九月起就已经做着一九五二年的工作了。
    一九五○年，六百公里长的斯大林格勒自流渠的建筑已经开始，这个自流渠将把伏尔加河与乌拉尔河连接起来。渠水将给半沙漠地带带来生命。伏尔加河—阿赫都宾斯基水渠的挖掘工作也同时开始了。
    在一九五一年，为建筑者们建造了一个新城市。第一批整齐舒适的以石头砌成的房屋已经住上了人。城市中建筑了俱乐部、医院、公共饭厅和商店。城市也被绿化了。
    一九五二年，对于我们是建筑水电站基本环节的巨大工作的一年。一九五二年建筑——装配工作的规模，将比一九五一年增加四倍。
    我们全体工作人员的全部事业和思想，就是怎样尽可能更快地使伏尔加河上斯大林格勒水电站开始发电，使伏尔加河沿岸的草原得到使之生气勃勃的水分。我们是在为人民的幸福而建筑着！
    （斯大林格勒水电站总工程师、斯大林奖金获得者迈德维捷夫作）
    捷克斯洛伐克工业生产的新的生力军
    一九五一年，捷克斯洛伐克政府为了要减缩行政费用，扫除文牍主义作风，同时又由于各工厂企业正处于急需人力的情况下，曾决定了把七万七千五百名机关工作人员转移到生产岗位上去。到一九五一年九月底，就已经有六万三千九百六十三名机关工作人员离开了办公室，走向工厂或建筑场所了。
    机关工作人员的转业，使得工厂增加了新的生产生力军，可以实行两班或三班制。原来由于缺乏人力，珍贵的机器不得不每天空闲八至十六小时，但是在机关工作人员纷纷转业到工厂之后，这种情形就转变了，并且生产成本将因之减低，生产品将因而大大增多。在另一方面，机关里也将因此而提高工作效率并减省了一大笔行政费用。
    一个机关工作人员到了工厂里去会有什么感想呢？安东尼·马赛克在一九五一年六月离开原有的职业，经过了训练班六个星期的学习，到布拉格的斯大林格勒厂当一名镟床工人。在工作了一段时期以后，马赛克说：“没有到过厂里去的人，他不会了解一个技巧熟练的工人和艺术家一样对于真的创造感到满意。工人的职业需要有创作的思想和从速决断的能力。大多数的新工人都发现机器有一股魔力，那是他们从未想到的。”匈牙利斯大林纪念碑揭幕
    一九五一年十二月十六日，“约·维·斯大林”纪念碑在匈牙利首都布达佩斯隆重揭幕。这个揭幕典礼是布达佩斯劳动人民的一个盛大节日，同时，也是匈牙利人民对伟大的斯大林所怀的敬爱和忠诚的一个动人明证。
    从清晨起，布达佩斯的居民的队伍便持着斯大林的画像、匈牙利人民共和国的国旗和红旗向市中心集合。以红色的石头为台基的、高达八米的世界劳动人民的领袖斯大林的青铜雕像，便树立在那里。
    参加这一集会的人在五万以上。站在主席台上的有拉科西、格罗、匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席罗奈伊、部长会议主席道比、匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会政治局的委员和政府首长们。
    大会由匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会书记里瓦伊致辞。他指出：匈牙利人民的解放和成就是与伟大的斯大林的名字分不开的。
    最后，当他祝贺斯大林同志的健康和万寿无疆时，到会群众一致高呼“斯大林万岁”！“斯大林万寿无疆”！
