    Vigorously Mobilize the Masses and Fight for the Thorough Development of the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement!
    (Speech delivered on January 6, 1952, at a meeting of cadres at or above the level of section chief in first-level organizations in the Northwest Region)
    Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee
    The great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has already begun in the Northwest region. However, the development of this movement is not yet entirely satisfactory. The movement can only be described as being in its initial stage, not only developing unevenly but also lacking depth, breadth, and vigor. The arrows of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy have not yet hit the mark. In other words, this movement is still circling around general phenomena of corruption and waste and has not yet seized the large and important aspects to attack. This is still far from our goal of thoroughly eliminating corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. This is only sweeping the dust off our bodies, and the dirt on our bodies has not been removed. That is to say, we haven’t taken a bath yet, so how can we talk about being clean and sanitary? Up to now, the general situation of the rectification movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the Northwest region is like this.
    Looking at the situation in various parts of the Northwest region, various departments, and various organizations, as pointed out in the People's Daily editorial published on January 5, it can be roughly divided into three categories: good, relatively good, and bad. The basic sign distinguishing these three situations is the depth of mass mobilization. In some units, the masses have been fully mobilized, and the movement has developed healthily and vigorously. However, this situation is still only a minority. In some units, the masses have only been generally mobilized, and the movement is not so powerful, but lacks content. This situation is still the majority. In some units, the masses have basically not been mobilized. The leadership there is still asleep, and no one is leading the masses, as if it were a "Shangri-La." In military terms, these are "blind spots." This is the worst situation, and there are still many units like this. In order to deepen this movement, in the future, for those belonging to the first category, we must adhere to correct leadership and continue to deepen the movement in order to achieve a rapid and thorough solution to this battle. Those belonging to the second category must be determined to eliminate obstacles and learn from good examples. The third category is a very bad situation. If we tolerate this situation continuing, it will inevitably greatly hinder the development of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. If we do not change it immediately, the interests of the people and the country will be seriously harmed. Therefore, we must urgently mobilize in all Party organizations, all government departments, and military departments, all state-owned and public-owned industrial, transportation, banking, and trade organizations and enterprises, all cooperative organizations, Communist Youth League organizations, and leadership organs at all levels of people's organizations, and all private industrial and commercial enterprises related to the above-mentioned aspects, without exception, fully mobilize the masses so that the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy forms a vigorous and substantive mass movement, just like the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and resolutely carry it out to the end in a grand and swift manner.
    Judging from the problems exposed in the movement during this period, the phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are very serious in our Northwest region. First, in terms of corruption, the problems that have been uncovered are already very alarming. Without this movement, who would have known that so many people among our cadres have become thieves? They wear the clothes of revolutionary cadres and engage in stealing state property. These elements are not only shameful but also guilty. Their crime is that of corrupt elements who steal state property. Among corrupt elements, there are big corrupt elements and small corrupt elements. No matter what tricks they play, they are all people who have no thought and no soul. They are already trapped in the mud, have lost their fighting will, have been infected with the filth of the exploiting classes, and have become enemies of the people and saboteurs of the revolution. We cannot adopt a tolerant attitude towards such people. What is especially worthy of our vigilance is that, as can be seen from the problems that have now been discovered, there are not only many big corrupt cases, but even more small corrupt cases. Many large-scale corrupt activities have developed from small-scale corrupt activities. Therefore, we must never sit idly by and watch our comrades fall one after another and be conquered by class enemies. This is our due revolutionary will and a revolutionary responsibility that every revolutionary cadre must have.
    Extravagance and waste are more common and more serious than corruption and theft, and they are not valued by the average person. Some wasteful elements even believe that "corruption is a crime, but waste is harmless," and "waste is unavoidable in order to complete tasks." Therefore, the damage of waste to national wealth far exceeds that of corruption and theft. Extravagant and wasteful elements often pride themselves on not having stolen state property for their own private gain. This is a very bad idea. It must be understood that the people and the state want us to do one thing with one yuan, not to spend a lot of money and do very little. If we spend a large sum of money and spoil the cause of the people and the state, should we feel at ease? What is the difference between this kind of damage to national wealth and corruption and theft? Therefore, corruption is shameful, and waste is also shameful. Corruption is a crime, and waste is also a crime, but the latter's crime is waste.
    Bureaucracy is the mother of corruption and waste. Bureaucrats are often the advocates and approvers of wasteful behavior, and the cover-up and connivers of corrupt behavior. Without bureaucracy, corruption and waste would not grow, or would not grow so much. Bureaucrats often pride themselves on being clean. Little do they know that it is precisely because bureaucrats keep their eyes closed all day long that they open the door to enemy invasion. The enemy always praises and says good things about the work of bureaucrats. If bureaucrats did not exist, the evil flies would be eliminated. Can it still be said that bureaucrats are correct? Is their harm to the people and the country less than corruption and waste? No, we must recognize the harmfulness of bureaucracy and recognize the characteristics of bureaucracy. Bureaucrats are first of all arrogant and complacent, have no sense of right and wrong, have no clear attitude, and are ambiguous. They are muddle-headed in the face of new things. They never see what others are doing correctly. They neither master the materials nor conduct investigations and research. Their hands and feet are busy, but their brains are resting, and their senses are slow. They are the loyal elders of evil winds. They are satisfied with the formal tranquility of things and do not go to explore the essence of things, or they are intoxicated with some slight reforms, but they lose vigilance against the class enemy's fierce attacks in disguise, indulge corruption and waste, and do not actively defend and fundamentally eliminate them. Among them, some people have unclean hands themselves and have corrupt behavior. Therefore, they are passive and perfunctory in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and they are outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant. Such bureaucracy has nothing in common with our fighting Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, while opposing corruption and waste, we must severely attack bureaucracy. This is the basic requirement in ideological leadership for us to first carry out the struggle against corruption and waste in order to implement the central government's slogan of "streamlining administration and increasing production and practicing economy." We must recognize that if corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are not thoroughly eliminated, they will corrupt our Party, our government, our army, and all financial and economic institutions and all revolutionary mass organizations, causing many of our cadres to be discredited and causing great disasters to our country. In a word, there is a danger of the Party, the country, and ourselves perishing.
    How to further carry out the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy? This movement must be carried out simultaneously among all Party members, government officials, soldiers, and civilians in the entire region, both internally and externally, from top to bottom, in cities and villages, and among all the people. We must universally mobilize and implement key inspections. Universal mobilization is for mobilizing the masses, so that everyone can take a bath ideologically; key inspections are for in-depth exposure and eradicating our wounds. Therefore, we should focus on financial and economic organs and professional departments, and in general organs, we should focus on departments in charge of finance. Judicial and public security organs should also focus on checking whether staff members have taken bribes or extorted money. Cadres in charge of various organs should also check their personal expenses, set an example, and not only ensure that they do not waste themselves, but also ensure that the people around them do not waste, in order to change the atmosphere. The spearhead of the struggle should be directed against large and consistent corrupt, wasteful, and degenerate elements. For small and medium-sized corrupt, wasteful, and degenerate elements, they should be educated and reformed, and they should be told to thoroughly confess and repent, and to confess clearly at one time. Those who confess clearly at one time should be treated differently in handling. We should deal with them separately according to the size of the mistakes and the degree of repentance.
    In view of the fact that many corrupt acts among cadres in many organs are carried out in collusion with unscrupulous merchants, or are induced by unscrupulous merchants, we must also carry out this movement in the industrial and commercial circles at the same time, help the Federation of Industry and Commerce to promote this movement, and encourage industrialists and businessmen to confess bribery and tax evasion. Criminal acts among them should also be dealt with separately according to the seriousness of the circumstances and the degree of repentance. The confession movement in the organs will promote the confession movement in the industrial and commercial circles, and the development of the confession movement in the industrial and commercial circles will in turn promote the confession movement in the organs. Many people who have committed corruption and bribery are afraid of being denounced by merchants. Therefore, in carrying out the confession movement, we must crack down on corrupt elements who resist confession and expose their behavior of threatening and enticing and hindering confession.
    However, the important key to the problem lies in leadership. According to general information, the masses in some places cannot be mobilized, mainly because there are problems with the leadership. One is bureaucratic leadership, not the head of the organization taking responsibility and taking action personally. They have not realized that opposing corruption and opposing waste is a serious ideological struggle and political struggle, and treat it with a serious and conscientious attitude, but treat it as a passing fad, fearing the head and the tail, and being indecisive. They do not actively and proactively adopt a combat stance and personally "go to the front line," but entrust others to do it, while they are high above. Such people must change, otherwise the discipline of the state will find them. The other is that the leading cadres themselves have unclean hands and dare not face this struggle, but they have not thought that it is already a mistake to have unclean hands. If they do not take the initiative to confess what mistakes they have made and examine themselves, then it will be one mistake on top of another. By doing so, they become obstacles to the movement and become the object of mass struggle. Therefore, we must resolutely remove those who stubbornly resist and passively shirk their responsibilities from their current positions and give them disciplinary sanctions. No matter what type of bureaucrat they are, their only correct path is to correct their mistakes, catch up with the movement, and lead the movement. Any other path is wrong and will cause losses to the interests of the country and bury their own future.
    Active communists and all revolutionary workers with strong fighting spirit, eliminate all worries, vigorously stand at the forefront of the movement, and bravely and resolutely carry out the struggle. Everyone must resolutely and boldly expose and report all phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. We must also adopt the method of naming names by the leadership, and check whenever we feel that something is "not right."
    To promote democracy, we must first oppose the phenomenon of suppressing democracy. Leaders of various units must humbly examine themselves, inspire criticism and self-criticism, listen to the opinions of the masses, and adopt the correct opinions of the masses. This is the key to mobilizing the masses to carry out the movement. We are ordering the leading comrades of various units to catch up with the movement.
    It is necessary to effectively lead the struggle to the end, complete it within a time limit, and deal with it if it is overdue. Oppose perfunctory practices and oppose plans and verbal appeals only. Strive to achieve significant results in the struggle. Reports to superiors must have practical content, and perfunctory reports will be returned in all cases.
    Let us have a competition on the front lines of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy! See who runs in front, see whose family is thoroughly opposed, and who makes rapid progress. The Savings and Inspection Committee will make a fair judgment in the future.
    Carrying out the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is a serious test for all Communist Party members, leading cadres at all levels, and all cadres, and it is also a serious test for the leadership of the Communist Party committees at all levels. The struggle will show who is firmly standing on the position of the Party and the country and is completely loyal to the interests of the Party and the country; who are liberals or selfish and self-interested elements. As long as we resolutely and thoroughly implement the movement, we will definitely be able to diagnose and remove the bacteria in our blood—that is, serious corrupt and degenerate elements. Comrades, let us resolutely carry out a major cleanup and wash of the political microorganisms that have eroded our bodies, and let the sun shine everywhere! This is a historically significant movement to consolidate and strengthen the combat effectiveness of the Communist Party and to closely link the people's government and every revolutionary cadre with the masses. Let us all work hard to rectify the revolutionary ranks to make them stronger, more combative, and move forward victoriously!

    大张旗鼓地发动群众，为深入开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动而斗争！
    （一九五二年一月六日在西北区一级机关处长以上干部大会上的讲话）
    中共中央西北局书记、西北军政委员会副主席　习仲勋
    反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的伟大斗争，已在西北地区开展了。但是，这个运动的发展情况还不能令人十分满意，运动还只能说是处在初期状态中，不仅发展的不平衡，而且是不深、不广，劲头不大。反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的箭，还没有射中在要害上。也就是说，这个运动还只是在一般的贪污、浪费现象上打圈子，还没有抓住大的和重要的方面去进攻。这就与我们要求彻底肃清贪污、浪费、官僚主义现象的目的还距离很远。这只是打扫了一下我们身上的灰尘，而我们身上的肮脏，还没有去掉。这就是说，还没有洗过澡，如何能谈得上就很干净，很卫生了呢？截至目前为止，西北地区反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的整风运动，大体情况就是这样。
    从西北区各地、各部门和各机关中来看，其情况正如群众日报一月五日所载人民日报社论中所指出的那样，大体上也可分为三种：好的、较好的和不好的。区别这三种情况的基本标志，就是看群众发动的深度如何：有的单位把群众充分地发动起来了，运动就开展得健康而有力。但是，这种情况目前还只是少数；有的单位，还只是一般地发动了群众，运动就不是那样具有声势，而是缺乏内容，这种情况，在目前还是多数；有的单位，群众基本上没有发动起来，他们那里的领导上还在睡觉，群众没有人去领导，好像“世外桃源”。用军事术语来说：这是一些“死角”。这是最不好的情况，在目前还有不少单位是这样。为了深入开展这个运动，今后，凡属于第一种情况的，必须坚持正确的领导，使运动继续深入，以求得迅速而彻底地解决这个战斗。属于第二种情况的，必须决心扫除障碍，向好的榜样看齐。第三种情况，是很糟糕、很不好的情况，如果容忍这种情况继续存在下去，势必大大妨害反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的开展；如果不立即加以改变，就将使人民和国家的利益受到严重的损害。因此，我们必须紧急动员起来，在一切党的组织，一切政府部门和军事部门，一切国营和公营的工业、交通、银行、贸易的机关和事业部门，一切合作社组织、青年团组织和人民团体的各级领导机关以及一切和上述各方面发生关系的私营工商事业中，都毫不例外地充分发动群众，使反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义斗争形成一个轰轰烈烈的并且有内容的群众运动，如同镇压反革命的运动一样，大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地坚决进行到底。
    从这个时期运动中暴露出的问题来看，贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象，在我们西北地区是非常严重的。先就贪污来说，查出来的问题已经是很惊人的了。不进行这个运动，谁能知道在我们的干部中间，竟有这么多的人作了盗贼。他们穿着革命干部的服装，竟作盗窃国家财产的勾当，这些分子不仅可耻，而且有罪。他们的罪名就是盗窃国家财产的贪污犯。贪污分子中间，有大贪污犯，也有小贪污犯，不管他们玩什么名堂，耍什么花样，但他们都是已经没有思想、没有灵魂的人了。他们已经是陷在污泥之中，失去战斗意志，染上了剥削阶级的污毒，成了人民的敌人，革命的破坏分子，我们不能对这种人采取容忍的态度。尤其值得我们警惕的是，从现在已经发现了的问题可以看出：大贪污不少，小贪污更多。许多大贪污现象都是从小贪污发展起来的，因此，我们决不能坐视我们队伍里的战士一个又一个地倒下去，被阶级敌人征服。这是我们应有的革命意志，也是我们每一个革命干部所必须有的一种革命职责。
    铺张、浪费现象较之贪污盗窃更为普遍，也更为严重，并且不为一般人所重视。有些浪费分子甚至认为：“贪污有罪，浪费无妨”，“为了完成任务，浪费是不可避免的”。因而，浪费对国家财富的损害远超过于贪污和盗窃。铺张、浪费分子常常以没有将国家的财产窃为私有而自得，这是很坏的思想。要知道：人民和国家是要我们用一个钱办一个钱的事，而不是让我们花费很多的钱而办很少的事，如果花费大笔款项而办坏了人民和国家的事业，难道也应该问心自安吗？这一种对国家财富的损害，比之于贪污和盗窃又有什么不同呢？因而，贪污可耻，浪费也可耻，贪污有罪，浪费也有罪，不过后者罪名是浪费。
    官僚主义是贪污、浪费之母。官僚主义分子常常就是浪费行为的倡导者，批准者，是贪污行为的掩护者，纵容者。没有官僚主义，贪污浪费就不会滋长起来，或不会很多地滋长起来。官僚主义者，又常常以自己身上干净而自豪。殊不知，正是由于官僚主义者这样整天闭着眼睛，才给敌人的侵袭开了大门。官僚主义者的工作，敌人总是称道和说好的，没有官僚主义者存在，万恶的苍蝇就会消灭。难道还能说官僚主义者是正确的吗？他们对人民和国家的危害会小于贪污浪费吗？不是的，我们必须认识官僚主义的危害性，认识官僚主义的特点。官僚主义分子，首先骄傲自满，无是非观念，没有明朗态度、含糊其词；在新事物面前昏头昏脑，别人作得正确的，他们总看不到眼里；既不掌握材料，又不调查研究，手脚忙碌，头脑休息，感觉迟钝。他们是歪风的忠厚长者。他们满足于事物形式上的平静，不去发掘事物的本质，或者陶醉于若干点滴的改革，反而对于阶级敌人变换方式的猛烈进攻丧失警惕，放任贪污浪费，不积极设防和根本清除。其中，有些人是自己手上就不干净，就有贪污腐化行为，因此，对反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的斗争消极怠工，阳奉阴违，这样的官僚主义当然与我们战斗的马列主义无丝毫共同之点。因此，在反贪污、反浪费的同时，必须痛击官僚主义。这是我们为实行中央提出的“精兵简政，增产节约”的口号首先进行反对贪污反对浪费斗争中，思想领导上的基本要求。必须认清：对于贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象，如果不加以彻底肃清，它们就会腐蚀我们的党，腐蚀我们的政府、军队及一切财经机构和一切革命的群众组织，使我们许多干部人员身败名裂，给我们的国家造成极大的灾害，一句话：这就有亡党、亡国、亡身的危险。
    如何进一步地开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争呢？这个运动必须在全区党政军民、内外上下、城市乡村以及全体人民中同时开展起来。我们必须普遍动员、并实行重点检查。普遍动员是为的发动群众，大家都在思想上洗个澡；重点检查是为的深入揭发，根治我们的创伤。因此，我们应当以财政经济机关和专业部门为重点，在一般机关则以掌管财务的部门为重点。司法、公安机关，也要着重检查工作人员有无受贿、敲诈行为。各机关负责的干部也应检查个人的开支，以身作则，不但做到自己不浪费，并且使自己左右的人员也不浪费，以改变风气。斗争的锋芒应针对大的和一贯的贪污、浪费、腐化分子。对中小贪污、浪费、腐化分子，则经过教育改造，叫他们彻底坦白、反省，一次坦白清楚。对中小贪污、浪费、腐化分子或一次坦白清楚的人，在处理上应该是有区别的。我们就应根据错误大小，悔改程度来分别处理。
    鉴于许多机关干部中的贪污行为都是勾结奸商进行，或受奸商引诱的，因此，我们必须同时在工商界开展这个运动，帮助工商联合会去推动这个运动，鼓励工商业者坦白行贿、漏税行为。对他们中间的犯罪行为也应该按情节轻重、悔改程度去分别处理。机关的坦白运动，将推动工商界的坦白运动，而工商界的坦白运动的开展，又会反过来推动机关的坦白运动。许多有贪污、受贿行为的人害怕商人检举。因此，在开展坦白运动中，必须打击抗拒坦白的贪污分子，揭露他们威胁利诱阻碍坦白的行为。
    但是，问题的重要关键还是在于领导。根据一般情况了解，有的地方群众发动不起来，主要是领导上有问题。一种是官僚主义的领导，不是首长负责，亲自动手。他们没有认识到反对贪污、反对浪费是一场严重的思想斗争和政治斗争，用严肃认真的态度去对待它，而当作刮一阵风的态度去对待，畏首畏尾，拖泥带水；不积极主动地采取战斗姿态，亲自“上前线”，而是委托别人去作，自己高高在上。这种人必须改变过来，不然国家的纪律就会找在他们的头上。另一种是领导干部自己手上不干净，不敢正视这个斗争，但是他们没有想到：自己手上不干净，已经是错误了，如果现在还不主动地有什么错误就坦白什么错误，自己坦白，自己检讨，那就是一错再错了。他们这样做就成为运动的阻碍者，就会变成群众斗争的对象。因此，对那些顽强抵抗、消极怠工的分子，我们必须坚决把他从现在的工作岗位上撤下来，给以纪律制裁。无论是那一种类型的官僚主义分子，他们的正确道路只有一条，就是：改正错误，赶上运动，领导运动。任何别的道路，都是错误的，都将使国家利益遭受到损失和葬送自己的前途。
    积极的共产党员和一切斗志坚强的革命工作人员，排除一切顾虑，大张旗鼓，站在运动前面，勇敢、坚决地开展斗争。大家坚决起来大胆地揭发与检举一切贪污浪费和官僚主义现象。我们还要采取领导上点名的办法，觉得“味道不对”就去查。
    发扬民主，首先就要反掉压制民主的现象。各单位领导人必须虚心检讨，启发批评与自我批评，倾听群众的意见，采纳群众的正确意见，这是发动群众开展运动的关键。我们责成各单位领导同志赶上运动。
    要切实领导斗争贯彻下去，限期作好，逾期议处。反对草率应付的作法，反对只有计划，口头号召。务使斗争取得显著成绩。对上报告要有实际内容，应付式的报告一律打回。
    让我们在反对贪污、反对浪费和反对官僚主义的战线上来一个竞赛吧！看谁跑在前面，看谁家反的彻底，进步迅速，将来由节约检查委员会作一个公正评判。
    开展反对贪污、反对浪费和反对官僚主义的斗争，对全体共产党员、各级领导干部和全体干部，是一次严重的考验，对共产党各级党委的领导也是一次严重的考验。在斗争中可以看出谁是坚定地站在党和国家的立场，完全忠实于党和国家的利益；谁是自由主义分子或自私自利的分子，只要我们坚决、彻底地把运动贯彻下去，一定可以把我们血液中的细菌——即严重的贪污腐化分子诊断出来，驱除出去。同志们：坚决地把侵蚀到我们肌体中的政治微生物来一次大清除，大洗涤，让阳光普晒一遍吧！这是一次巩固与加强共产党的战斗力和密切人民政府、每个革命干部与群众间联系的、有历史意义的运动。让我们大家努力，把革命的队伍，整顿得更坚强，更有战斗力，胜利前进吧！
