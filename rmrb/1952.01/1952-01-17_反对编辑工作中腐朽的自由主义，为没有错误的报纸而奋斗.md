    Oppose Corrupt Liberalism in Editorial Work, Strive for a Newspaper Without Errors
    Liao Jingtian, Director of Guangxi Daily
    Editor's Note: The article "Treat Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin's Telegrams Seriously," published in the "Cultural Life" column on page three of this newspaper on October 11th of last year, criticized the politically irresponsible attitude of Guangxi Daily and 19 other newspapers. Based on this criticism, the Guangxi Daily editorial department conducted a more thorough examination of the work of the entire editorial department and identified the main reason for the errors: the corrupt liberalist style of the editorial department. This corrupt liberalist style is also the fundamental cause of the continuous errors in other newspapers and periodicals. Therefore, fundamentally identifying this cause and correcting it is the basic way to eliminate errors in press and publishing work. We now publish the self-criticism of Liao Jingtian, Director of Guangxi Daily, for the reference of newspapers and periodicals in various places.

    The People's Daily's "Cultural Life" column on October 11th criticized the serious errors made by Guangxi Daily in handling the congratulatory telegrams from Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin on the "September 3rd" Victory Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan. This prompted us to conduct a more thorough examination of the leadership and work of the editorial department and became a turning point for us to rectify our work style and correct errors.

    The serious errors we made in handling the "September 3rd" congratulatory telegrams from Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin were not accidental; they were the inevitable result of a recent series of errors. The reason why this series of errors occurred is that there were major problems with our leadership style and the work style of all comrades in the editorial department under the influence of this style.

    Our editorial department has long been filled with a corrupt liberalist atmosphere. Work is lax, and many editorial staff members seem to be employees in bourgeois bureaucratic organs, going to work and getting off work as usual, arriving late and leaving early, perfunctorily reading the manuscripts and then going to the reference room to read novels or browse newspapers. Work regulations and work plans are stuffed in drawers or pressed under waste paper, making the entire editorial department's atmosphere dull and lifeless, resulting in frequent errors in the newspaper. People's names and place names are written incorrectly, and even the titles of the directors of the provincial people's government departments and the names of commissioners and mayors are mistaken. Numbers don't add up, and even the population figures of China are wrong. Among the many errors that have occurred, many are political errors. For example, the People's Daily has already criticized the incorrect handling of the "September 3rd" congratulatory telegrams from Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin, the violation of historical reality and idealist viewpoints in the introduction to Party history, even including Yugoslavia in the camp of people's democratic countries, and calling Hong Kong compatriots overseas Chinese, etc.

    Why do so many errors occur? Is there no system for reviewing manuscripts and proofreading? There is. Each manuscript is routinely passed through the eyes of the editor, group leader, editorial committee member, editorial director, editor-in-chief, and proofreader, and finally, someone checks the proofs one last time. So why can these errors pass through each level without hindrance? There is no other explanation than that we, the "generals" guarding these checkpoints, are careless, irresponsible to the Party and the people, and shirk responsibility. The editor thinks that the group leader will check, the group leader thinks that the editorial committee will check, the editorial committee thinks that the editorial director or editor-in-chief will check, and when it is sent to the factory, there is also a proofreader, and finally, the director checks the proofs. And when the director checks the proofs, he thinks that it has already been checked by the proofreader, editorial director, or editor-in-chief, so there probably won't be any problems. As a result, many errors appear grandly and unimpeded. Who discovered these errors? Because most of our comrades are very careless when reading the newspaper, although individual errors are discovered by individual comrades, most major errors are only known after they are pointed out by readers or the People's Daily and Study magazine. What do we do after we know? Some are corrected as technical reasons, and some say "careless," and everyone laughs it off as "all's well." We also have a system of checking the newspaper every day, and the proofreading section also marks the errors on the editor's original manuscript and hangs it in the editorial office; but at first, everyone paid more attention to these things, but later they simply ignored them. In fact, even if we read the opinions put forward by others, we just look at them, and at most, we talk about them casually. Who still takes it seriously! And we, the responsible comrades, remain calm and act as if nothing has happened, as if we don't understand the adverse effects of errors in the newspaper on the Party's actual work and the people, or the harm to the Party's cause; as if we are standing on the sidelines and not responsible for these errors at all. If we cannot seriously and earnestly conduct self-criticism, we will certainly not lead the masses to fight to avoid and eliminate errors. Therefore, errors occur one after another.

    It's not entirely true to say that we haven't done any self-criticism. Because when errors are discovered, some of our comrades sometimes say: "I'm a bit careless," "My political level is low." But what kind of self-criticism is this? Carelessness is an anti-Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought method of thinking and attitude towards work. Why can a Communist Party member, a newspaper worker, a leader of a newspaper, use careless methods and attitudes to treat the Party's cause and newspaper work? Obviously, only superficially criticizing "carelessness" without digging to the root cannot thoroughly correct the errors.

    It is also a fact that the political level is low; but the question is: since you know it is low, why don't you work hard to improve it? The Party Constitution stipulates "striving to improve one's own level of awareness and understanding of the basics of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought" as the obligation of Party members. You are a Party member, or a Party member who is entrusted with a part of the responsibility by the Party, why don't you resolutely fulfill the obligations stipulated by the Party Constitution? Isn't this impurity of Party spirit? Especially if you are a newspaper worker, a responsible comrade of a newspaper, doing the Party's important political work, you cannot allow the situation of low political level to exist for a long time, and you must never allow using low political level to excuse political errors.

    In fact, many errors cannot be explained by saying that the political level is low. Our authors cannot not know that the Tito gang has long become the most shameful traitor to socialism; our editors cannot not know that the Communist Party members promoted Mr. Sun Yat-sen to reorganize the Kuomintang not in 1927; our editor-in-chief and director cannot not know these things; but errors still occurred. Can this be explained by a low political level? Besides being irresponsible to the Party and the people, what other reason can explain it?

    Many staff members in the editorial department have a high degree of enthusiasm for work. They have opinions when they see errors in the newspaper, and some have actively put forward opinions. However, because our leading comrades are divorced from the masses and bureaucratic, they have not listened well to the opinions of the masses, and have not seriously dealt with the correct criticisms and suggestions put forward by the masses. The masses feel that their opinions are not valued and do not play a role. Over time, they no longer speak. Many comrades initially devoted themselves to their work, able to use their brains to seriously study and strive to improve their work, but did not receive support and encouragement from the leadership; while some comrades were passive and lax, irresponsible, tired and dragging, and smiled cheekily when errors occurred, but were not criticized. More importantly, there is also a lack of serious and earnest criticism and self-criticism among the leading comrades. This has gradually allowed the atmosphere of corrupt liberalism to permeate the entire editorial department.

    The credibility of the newspaper among readers and the masses has therefore gradually decreased. Readers say: You criticize others all day long, why don't you make self-criticism when you often make mistakes yourself?

    This time, the People's Daily gave us a stern rebuke, making us realize that this situation can no longer continue. Only by resolutely rectifying our work style can we correct our errors. Isolated, piecemeal self-criticism that treats the symptoms but not the root cause is useless. Therefore, we led the entire editorial department for more than ten hours, holding small and large meetings, to conduct a comprehensive review of the recent leadership and work of the editorial department. The editorial committee has also repeatedly held meetings to study, believing that these errors should be the primary responsibility of the editorial committee members and the director. In addition to the director, editor-in-chief, and the main responsible persons who made the errors making public self-criticism at the meeting and publishing written self-criticism in the newspaper, it was also decided to make a public self-criticism in the newspaper in the name of the editorial committee, as a sign of determination to correct errors. Secondly, it was decided to improve the editorial committee's leadership of the editorial department, and the director must bear the primary responsibility for the work of the editorial department. The editorial department must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and no reason can be used to occupy the prescribed study time. And establish a responsibility system, strengthen criticism and self-criticism, rectify the work style and strengthen the political education of factory and proofreading personnel. At the same time, use various methods to continue to attract readers to strictly supervise and check the work of the newspaper, in order to completely overcome the liberalist style and strive for a newspaper without errors!

    反对编辑工作中腐朽的自由主义，为没有错误的报纸而奋斗
    广西日报社社长   廖经天
    编者按：去年十月十一日本报三版“文化生活”栏发表的“严肃地对待毛主席和斯大林大元帅的函电”一文，批评了广西日报等二十家报纸政治上不够负责的态度。广西日报编辑部根据这一批评，较深刻地检查了整个编辑部的工作，找出了造成错误的主要原因是编辑部的腐朽的自由主义作风。这种腐朽的自由主义作风，也是其他报刊不断发生错误的根本病源。因此，从根本上找出这种病源，加以纠正，是在新闻出版工作中消灭错误的基本办法。现将广西日报社社长廖经天的检讨发表于后，以供各地报刊参考。
    去年十月十一日的人民日报“文化生活”栏，批评了广西日报在处理毛主席和斯大林大元帅关于“九三”抗战胜利纪念日贺电所发生的严重错误，促使我们比较深刻地检查了编辑部的领导和工作，成为我们整顿作风、纠正错误的一个转折点。
    我们在处理毛主席和斯大林大元帅“九三”贺电上所发生的严重错误并不是偶然的，这是最近一连串的错误发展的必然结果。而这一连串的错误之所以造成，是因为我们的领导作风，以及在这种作风影响下的编辑部全体同志的工作作风有着很大问题。
    我们的编辑部，长期充满着一种腐朽的自由主义空气。工作散漫，不少编辑工作人员好像是资产阶级官僚机关里的雇员，照例每天上班下班，迟到早退，马马虎虎地把稿子看完就到资料室看小说或浏览报纸；工作条例、工作计划塞在抽屉里或压在废纸底下，把整个编辑部的空气弄得死气沉沉，以致在报纸上经常出现错误。错写人名、地名，甚至连省人民政府厅长的职衔和专员、市长的名字都搞错了；数字对不上头，甚至连中国人口的数字也都搞错。在所发生的许多错误中，有不少是政治性的错误。如人民日报已批评过的把毛主席和斯大林大元帅“九三”贺电作了错误的处理，在党史介绍中违反历史现实和唯心论的观点，甚至把南斯拉夫列入人民民主国家的阵营，以及把香港同胞称作侨胞等等。
    为什么发生这样多的错误呢？难道没有审稿和看大样的制度吗？有。每一篇稿子都照例从编辑、组长、编辑委员、编辑主任、总编辑和校对的眼睛下一关一关地通过，最后还有人看一次大样。那么这些错误为什么还能够一关一关地通过而毫无阻挡呢？没有别的解释，就是由于我们这些把守关口的“将军”们粗枝大叶，对党对人民不负责任，互相推诿。编辑以为还有组长看，组长以为还有编委看，编委以为还有编辑主任或总编辑看，发到工厂还有校对，最后还有社长看大样；而社长看大样时，又以为已经经过校对、编辑主任或总编辑看过了，大概不会有什么问题了，结果许多错误便毫无阻拦地大摇大摆地出现了。这些错误是谁发现的呢？由于我们大部分同志看报很马虎，虽然也有个别错误被个别同志发现，但多数重大的错误都是在读者或人民日报、学习杂志指出以后才知道的。知道以后怎么办呢？有的当作是技术上的原因更正一下，有的说一声“马虎”，相对一笑便“万事大吉”。我们也有每天检查报纸的制度，校对科也把编辑原稿上的错误划出来挂在编辑室里；但对这些东西在开始时大家还比较注意，后来索性就不管了。其实就是看了别人所提出的意见，也不过看看而已，最多是随便谈论一下，谁还把它当作一回事呢！而我们这些负责同志，也泰然处之，行若无事，好像根本不了解报纸发生的错误会在党的实际工作中，在人民群众中有什么恶劣影响，会对党的事业有什么危害；好像自己是站在旁边，根本不对这些错误负责的样子。自己不能严肃地认真地进行检讨，当然更不会领导群众为避免错误消灭错误而斗争。因此，错误就接二连三地出现了。
    说完全没有作过检讨，好像也不合事实。因为当错误发现以后，我们有些同志有时也说说：“我有点粗枝大叶”、“我的政治水平低”。但是，这算什么检讨呢？粗枝大叶是一种反马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的思想方法和工作态度，一个共产党员，一个报纸工作者，一个报纸的领导人，为什么能用粗枝大叶的方法和态度来对待党的事业、对待报纸的工作呢？显然，只浮浅地检讨“粗枝大叶”，而不去挖根，是不能彻底纠正错误的。
    政治水平低，也是事实；但问题是在于：你既然知道低，为什么不努力去提高呢？党章规定“努力地提高自己的觉悟程度和领会马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的基础”为党员的义务，你是一个党员，还是一个党让你担负一部分责任的党员，为什么不坚决地履行党章所规定的义务呢？这不是党性不纯吗？尤其你是一个报纸的工作人员，报纸的负责同志，作的是党的重要的政治工作，更不能容许政治水平低的情况长期存在，也决不能容许用政治水平低来原谅政治上的错误。
    其实，有许多错误，说政治水平低是说不过去的。我们的作者不会不知道铁托匪帮早已成为社会主义的最可耻的叛徒；我们的编者不会不知道共产党人推动孙中山先生改组国民党不在一九二七年；这一些，我们的总编辑、社长更不会不知道；但错误还是发生了。这难道可以用政治水平低来解释吗？除了对党对人民不负责任，还有什么理由可以解释呢？
    编辑部有不少的工作人员，是有高度工作热情的。他们看见报纸上出现了错误，都有意见，也曾经有人积极地提出意见。但由于我们领导同志脱离群众、官僚主义，没有很好地倾听群众的意见，没有认真地处理群众提出来的正确的批评和建议，群众感觉到提了意见不被重视，不起作用，久而久之，便再也不说话了。许多同志最初是埋头工作，能开动脑筋认真钻研努力改进工作的，但得不到领导方面的支持和鼓励；而有些同志消极散漫，不负责任，疲踏拖拉，发生错误则嬉皮笑脸，也没有受到批评。更重要的是领导同志之间也缺乏严肃认真的批评和自我批评，这样就使腐朽的自由主义空气逐渐弥漫于整个编辑部。
    报纸在读者群众中的威信因此逐渐降低了。读者说：你们整天批评别人，你们自己经常发生错误为什么不作自我批评呢？
    这一次，由于人民日报对我们大喝了一声，使我们认识到这种情况再也不能继续下去了。只有坚决整顿作风，才能纠正错误。头痛医头、脚痛医脚的孤立的就事论事的自我批评是无济于事的。因此，我们领导全编辑部用了十多小时的时间，开小会、大会，对最近的编辑部的领导和工作作了全面的检讨。编辑委员会也曾一再开会研究，认为这些错误应由编辑委员和社长负主要的责任，决定除社长、总编辑及犯错误的主要负责人在大会上作公开检讨，并在社报上公布书面检讨外，并用编辑委员会的名义在报上作公开的检讨，作为决心改正错误的表示。其次决定改进编辑委员会对编辑部的领导，社长必须对编辑部的工作负主要责任。编辑部要加强对马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的学习，不能用任何理由侵占规定的学习时间。并建立责任制，加强批评和自我批评，整顿作风和加强对工厂、校对人员的政治教育。同时，用各种办法继续吸引读者严格监督和检查报纸的工作，以期彻底克服自由主义作风，为没有错误的报纸而奋斗！
