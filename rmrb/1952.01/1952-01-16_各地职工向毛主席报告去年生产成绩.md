Workers of the Huainan Jiulonggang Coal Mine Set a New Coal Mining Record Again
	Dear Chairman Mao: All the workers in our mine always remember your call: increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. We unite as one, give full play to our high level of enthusiasm, and improve the utilization rate of machinery and equipment. The production volume of our entire mine exceeded the plan by 4.6 percent on December 20th last year; exceeded the plan by 13.3 percent on December 21st; and exceeded the plan by 30.8 percent on December 24th. The efficiency of the entire mine exceeded one ton per worker. The utilization rate of the electric winch in the new No. 3 well reached 100 percent, a record since the mine was built. In particular, on December 24th last year, the nationally renowned "National Day Brigade" of our mine created a new national record for collective coal mining efficiency. The "National Day Brigade" set a new national record for stepped coal mining collective efficiency of 11.851 tons in April last year. On December 24th last year, the first team of the "National Day Brigade," consisting of thirty-six workers, produced 655 tons of coal, and installed 528 props on the fully filled pseudo-inclined new coal mining face of the South Fourth Groove of the 330-meter West Second Stone Gate in the New No. 3 Well. The collective coal mining efficiency reached 18.194 tons, once again setting a new national record.
	We are determined to play a model leading role in all industrial and mining enterprises in East China. But we know that these achievements are still very small and are only the first step in increasing production and practicing economy. Therefore, we must not be arrogant or complacent, and we must create more wealth for the country.

Workers of the Fushun Mining Bureau's Electromechanical Plant Completed Production Tasks Last Year Exceeding the Previous Year by 90 Percent
	Respected Chairman Mao: Under your leadership and that of the Communist Party, we have victoriously passed through 1951. Over the past year, in the midst of the heated movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the patriotic production competition, we have given full play to our high level of patriotic labor enthusiasm and actively responded to the call for increased production and economy. As of the end of 1951, we completed the annual production task, exceeding the 1950 production task by more than 90 percent; in addition to completing the repair and assembly tasks of mining machinery, we also manufactured 34 kinds of products. The 325-horsepower electric locomotive DC motor is one of them. This motor rotates 620 revolutions per minute and has a vehicle speed of 276 kilometers per hour. In the quality inspection campaign, we solved 25 major key issues in machine quality and adopted 1,320 rationalization proposals. We have begun to produce nodular cast iron, vigorously promoted the advanced working methods of Kovalev and high-speed cutting methods, and implemented a piece-rate wage system. This has greatly improved production efficiency and reduced costs by 14 percent as planned. The turnover period of working capital was shortened by 240 days compared with 1950.
	Although we have these achievements, there are still many shortcomings in our work, and defective products have not been completely eliminated; there are still many problems in ensuring the repair and assembly tasks of the mine. Therefore, we must never be arrogant and must work hard to improve all tasks with a spirit of perseverance, strengthen the repair and manufacture of mining machinery, and continue to strive for the glorious tasks of increasing production and practicing economy, consolidating national defense, and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.

The Entire Staff of the Taiyuan Waterworks Company Cleared Out Useful Machines Worth Over 500 Million Yuan
	Respected Chairman Mao: Under your great call for increasing production and practicing economy, we have launched a vigorous campaign to clear assets, verify funds, and combat corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. We have achieved preliminary results. This is another victory for all employees under your wise leadership. On the occasion of the beginning of the new year, we would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you and the people of the whole country.
	Our company has many power machines, but only a broken and incomplete black oil engine is recorded in the accounts. Recently, after inspection and appraisal, we found six diesel engines with a total of 267 horsepower (five of which can be started with a little repair, and only one is badly damaged), with a total value of more than 504 million yuan. Regarding the important production equipment—the water distribution pipeline network, we never knew its length and location in the past (because the Japanese invaders burned the drawings when they surrendered). After this asset cleanup, coupled with the strong assistance of the people of this city, we have basically clarified the situation within fifteen days and started to draw up a sketch. This is also a major advancement in the management of urban tap water.
	Over the past year, through the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and carry out democratic reforms, our political consciousness has been greatly improved. We have launched a heated labor competition. We overfulfilled the annual production task by 37 percent; there were no accidents throughout the year; we guaranteed the water use of industry and citizens; we gave full play to the machine capacity, reduced electricity consumption, and reduced costs by 11 percent compared with 1950. The value we created throughout the year increased by 15 percent compared with 1950.
	We will consolidate the victories we have achieved and continue to carry out the movement to clear assets, verify funds, and combat corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to welcome the high tide of great production and construction.
	The entire staff of the Taiyuan Waterworks Company, Shanxi Province

### 各地职工向毛主席报告去年生产成绩

    各地职工向毛主席报告去年生产成绩
    淮南九龙岗煤矿职工再创采煤新纪录
    亲爱的毛主席：我们全矿职工时刻记着您的号召：增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。我们团结一致，发挥了高度的积极性，提高了机器设备的利用率。我们全矿的生产量，在去年十二月二十日超过计划百分之四点六；二十一日超过计划百分之十三点三；二十四日超过计划百分之三十点八，全矿全员效率突破了一吨以上。新三号井电绞车的利用率达到了百分之百，这个成绩是建矿以来所未有的。特别是去年十二月二十四日，我矿的全国闻名的“国庆大队”又创造了采煤集体效率全国新纪录。“国庆大队”在去年四月曾创造全国台阶式采煤集体效率十一点八五一吨的全国新纪录。去年十二月二十四日，“国庆大队”第一队三十六个工人，在新三号井三百三十米西二道石门南四槽，全充填伪倾斜新采煤法的掌子上，全天出了六百五十五吨煤，支了五百二十八根支柱，采煤集体效率达到十八点一九四吨，又一次创造了全国新纪录。
    我们下定决心，争取在全华东工矿企业中，起模范带头作用。但我们知道这些成绩还是很渺小的，只是增产节约的第一步。因此，我们一定不骄傲、不自满，要为国家创造更多的财富。
    淮南矿务局九龙岗煤矿全体职工
    抚顺矿务局机电厂职工去年完成的生产任务超过前年百分之九十
    敬爱的毛主席：我们在您和共产党的领导下，已经胜利地度过了一九五一年。一年来，我们在热火朝天的抗美援朝和爱国主义生产竞赛运动中，发挥了高度的爱国主义劳动热忱，并积极地响应了增产节约的号召。截至一九五一年末，我们完成了全年的生产任务，超过了一九五○年生产任务百分之九十以上；其中除完成了矿山机械的修配任务外，还制造出三十四种产品。三二五马力电机车直流电动机即是其中的一种。这部电动机每分钟转六百二十转，每小时车行速度二百七十六公里。在质量检查运动中，我们解决了二十五种机器质量上的重大关键问题，采纳了一千三百二十件合理化建议。我们已开始生产球墨铸铁，大力地推广郭瓦廖夫先进工作方法和高速切削法，并实行了计件工资制度。这便使生产效率大大提高，使成本也按照计划降低百分之十四，流动资金周转期较一九五○年缩短了二百四十一天。
    我们虽有这些成绩，但在工作上还存在着不少的缺点，还没有完全消灭废品；保证矿山修配任务中还有许多问题。因此，我们绝不能骄傲，要用再接再厉的精神努力提高各项工作，加强矿山机械的修配和制造，为增产节约，巩固国防，抗美援朝的光荣任务而继续奋斗。
    抚顺矿务局机电厂全体职工
    太原市自来水公司全体职工清理出值五亿余元的有用机器
    敬爱的毛主席：在您的伟大的增产节约号召下，我们展开了轰轰烈烈的清理资产、核定资金和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。我们已取得了初步的成绩。这是全体职工在您英明领导下的又一次胜利。值此新的一年开始的时候，谨以此向您和全国人民祝贺。
    我公司有许多动力机械，但在账上只记载着破烂不全的一部黑油发动机。最近我们经过检查和鉴定，查出柴油发动机六部，共二百六十七匹马力（其中五部稍加整修就可开动，只有一部损坏较大），总计价值五亿零四百多万元。关于生产上的重要设备——配水管网，我们在过去一向不知道它的长度和位置（因为日寇投降时把图烧了）。经过此次清理资产，加上本市人民的大力协助，我们在十五天内已基本弄清情况，并着手绘制草图。这在城市的自来水管理上，也是一个很大的进步。
    一年来，通过抗美援朝、镇压反革命、民主改革运动，我们的政治觉悟大为提高。我们展开了热烈的劳动竞赛。我们超额百分之三十七，完成了全年生产任务；一年内没有出事故；保证了工业和市民的用水；充分发挥了机器能力，减低了用电，使成本比一九五○年减低百分之十一。我们全年创造的价值较一九五○年提高百分之十五。
    我们将巩固已得的胜利，继续开展清理资产、核定资金以及反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，以迎接伟大的生产建设的高潮。
    山西省太原市自来水公司全体职工
