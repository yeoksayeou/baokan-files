Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League was held in Beijing from November 20th to 26th, 1951. Thirty-seven members and alternate members of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League attended the meeting. Those attending the meeting included secretaries of the Communist Youth League committees of major administrative regions, provinces, districts, and major cities, responsible cadres of the Communist Youth League in the army and railways, and responsible cadres of various departments of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, totaling 130 people.

This meeting reviewed and summarized the work of the Communist Youth League in the thirty-one months since the First National Congress of the Communist Youth League, and determined the central tasks of the Communist Youth League at present. Comrade Zhou Enlai, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a political report at the meeting. Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out that the current political tasks of the people of the whole country are: resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, strengthening national defense construction, carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and the ideological remolding movement. He called on members of the Communist Youth League to act as powerful assistants to the Communist Party of China in these tasks. Especially in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the Communist Youth League should, under the leadership of the Party, wage a resolute and thorough struggle against corruption and waste. Comrade Zhou Enlai finally pointed out that the Communist Youth League organization should pay attention to training cadres and send cadres to the Party and the government in a planned way. Comrade Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, made a report at the meeting on the "Current Situation and Work of the Communist Youth League," outlining the basic situation of the League and its current tasks, and pointing out how to further consolidate and strengthen the League organization, more closely unite the masses, and improve the leadership of the League.

The meeting held discussions based on Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report and Comrade Feng Wenbin's work report. Everyone unanimously agreed that the struggle against U.S. imperialism is a long-term task for the people and youth of the whole country. In order to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, the youth must be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and actively participate in national defense construction. The League organizations in various localities should strengthen education among young people in loving the motherland and defending the motherland; in the army, they should mobilize young people to actively participate in cultural studies, strengthen the work of cultural instructors, and various regions should strengthen militia work and vigorously carry out military sports work. Finally, Comrade Feng Wenbin made a summary of the meeting.

The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution: fully accepting Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report and striving to realize the various instructions in Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report. The meeting also unanimously adopted a resolution on Comrade Feng Wenbin's work report - "The Current Situation and Work of the Communist Youth League" and a resolution on launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy.

The meeting pointed out that the central task of the Communist Youth League at present is to mobilize members and the broad masses of young people to actively participate in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. The Communist Youth League organization should unite and educate all members and the broad masses of young people, so that they recognize the important significance of increasing production and practicing economy, give play to their characteristics and enthusiasm for accepting new things and daring to invent and create, improve work methods, promote production experience, and increase more wealth for the motherland. It should first eliminate corruption and waste in its own ranks and, under the leadership and support of the Party and the government, fight against all bad phenomena that violate the principles of increasing production and practicing economy.

The meeting pointed out that the Communist Youth League must actively participate in the central work of the Party and be good at strengthening, consolidating, and improving the League's organization in actual struggles. Only in this way can the League play a good role. In addition to issuing work instructions and resolutions based on the Party's central tasks, the League's organization can also put forward the League's opinions and plans for these tasks at the Party's work deployment meetings. If the League's county and district cadres are assigned by the Party to carry out general work in districts and villages, in addition to completing the work tasks assigned by the Party, they should also do a good job in the League's work in the area, so that the League's organization can promote the entire organization and all members to participate in the work in implementing the Party's work tasks, and better play an active role. The Communist Youth League must carry out any work under the leadership of the Party and in close coordination with all parties.

The meeting pointed out that ideological and political education should be strengthened among young people. On the one hand, we should combine the central tasks and actual struggles to educate League members and young people and improve their political and ideological level; on the other hand, we should strengthen systematic Marxist-Leninist education to help League members and young people ideologically draw a clear line between revolution and counter-revolution, wage a resolute struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and conduct necessary and appropriate criticism of petty-bourgeois and bourgeois ideas. Especially in schools, the League organization should cooperate closely with the student union, further implement the resolutions of the 15th National Congress of Students, and actively cooperate with and promote the ideological remolding movement of teachers and staff. The meeting also pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the study of the League's basic theory in order to improve the political and work level of cadres. The whole League should strengthen ideological leadership and often understand and study the ideological trends of young people of all strata.

The meeting promoted the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, reviewed and summarized the work, affirmed the achievements made by the Communist Youth League under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee in the past two years and more, and unanimously agreed that this is the main aspect of the work of the Communist Youth League; at the same time, it also criticized some shortcomings in the current work of the League, such as the League's organization's insufficient attention to the political and ideological education of League members, and insufficient in-depth and specific leadership.

The meeting re-elected the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, electing Feng Wenbin, Liao Chengzhi, Jiang Nanxiang, Li Chang, Rong Gaotang, Song Yiping, Xiao Hua, Qian Junrui, Lu Ping, Luo Yi, Liu Daosheng, Gao Yangwen, Xu Shiping, and Qu Tangliang as the fourteen members of the Standing Committee, Yang Shu, Zhang Ben, Xu Liqun, Dong Xin, and Zhang Ze as the five alternate members of the Standing Committee, and elected Feng Wenbin, Liao Chengzhi, Jiang Nanxiang, Li Chang, Rong Gaotang, and Song Yiping as the secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, forming the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League.

    这次会议检查并总结了青年团第一次全国代表大会召开以来的三十一个月的工作，并确定了当前青年团的中心任务。中国共产党中央书记处书记周恩来同志在会上作政治报告。周恩来同志指出当前全国人民的政治任务是：抗美援朝、加强国防建设力量、开展增产节约运动和思想改造运动。他号召青年团员要在这些任务中作为中国共产党的有力的助手。特别在增产节约运动中，青年团要在党的领导下向贪污浪费的现象作坚决彻底的斗争。周恩来同志最后指出：青年团组织要注意培养干部，并要有计划地向党和政府输送干部。青年团中央书记冯文彬同志在会上作了“青年团的目前情况与工作”的报告，概述了团的基本情况与当前的任务，并指出如何进一步巩固和壮大团的组织，更紧密地团结群众以及改进团的领导问题。
    会议根据周恩来同志的政治报告和冯文彬同志的工作报告，进行讨论。大家一致认为反对美帝国主义的斗争是全国人民和青年的一个长期任务。为了抗美援朝保家卫国，青年要随时准备响应祖国号召，并积极参加国防建设。各地团的组织要在青年中加强热爱祖国、保卫祖国的教育；在军队中，要动员青年积极参加文化学习，加强文化教员的工作，各地区要加强民兵工作，大力开展军事体育工作。最后并由冯文彬同志作了会议的总结。

    会议指出当前青年团的中心工作，就是发动团员和广大青年积极参加增产节约运动。青年团组织应该团结教育全体团员和广大青年群众，使他们认识增产节约的重要意义，发挥他们善于接受新鲜事物和勇于发明创造的特性和积极性，改进工作方法，推广生产经验，为祖国增加更多的财富，并应首先肃清自己队伍中的贪污浪费现象，在党和政府的领导和支持下，向违犯增产节约原则的一切不良现象进行斗争。
    会议指出青年团必须积极参加党的中心工作，善于在实际斗争中壮大、巩固和健全团的组织，只有这样，团才能很好地发挥作用。团的组织可根据党的中心任务，发出团的工作指示和决议以外，还可在党的工作布置会议中，提出团对这些工作的意见和计划。团的县、区干部如果在党的统一分配下去进行区村的一般工作时，除了必须完成党所指定的工作任务外，还应同时做好该地区的团的工作，使团的组织在执行党的工作任务方面推动整个组织、所有团员都参加工作，更好地发挥积极作用。青年团进行任何工作，都必须在党的领导下，与各方面密切地配合。
    会议指出应该加强在青年中进行思想政治教育。一方面应结合中心任务和实际斗争，教育团员和青年群众，提高他们的政治思想水平；另一方面要加强系统的马克思列宁主义的教育，帮助团员和青年群众在思想上划清革命与反革命的界限，对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义思想进行坚决的斗争，对小资产阶级、资产阶级思想要进行必要的、适当的批评。特别在学校中，团的组织要与学生会密切合作，进一步贯彻全国学生第十五届代表大会的决议，并积极配合和推动教职员的思想改造运动。会议并指出要加强团的基本理论学习，以提高干部的政治与工作水平。全团要加强思想领导，经常了解和研究各阶层青年的思想动态。
    会议发扬了批评与自我批评的精神，检查并总结了工作，肯定了两年多来青年团在毛主席和党中央的正确领导之下所获得的成绩，一致认为这是青年团工作的主要一方面；同时还批评了团的当前工作中的某些缺点，如团的组织对团员的政治思想教育不够重视，领导不够深入和具体等。
