    Certain Purchasing Units from Various Places in North China Stationed in Shanghai
    Seriously Waste Manpower and Resources
    Relevant Departments Should Immediately Stop This
    The North China Regional United Purchasing and Marketing Office recently conducted an in-depth understanding of the situation of the purchasing units sent by various provinces and cities in North China stationed in Shanghai and discovered many serious instances of waste. For example, Wang Yunsheng, a purchasing agent from the Tianjin Zhenhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory, only purchased 8.1 million yuan worth of goods in Shanghai last November, while other expenses amounted to more than 1.6 million yuan, including 510,000 yuan for entertainment expenses, 250,000 yuan for car, tram, and pedicab fares, 91,600 yuan for telephone expenses, 345,000 yuan for long-distance telephone calls, 70,000 yuan for electricity bills, 10,000 yuan for water bills, and 80,000 yuan for rent. He also hired a worker with a monthly salary of 300,000 yuan. Xin Taiming, a purchasing agent from the Hongguang Battery Factory in Anyang County, Pingyuan Province, had official business expenditures of only 28,188,350 yuan in November, while transportation expenses amounted to 300,630 yuan, and entertainment expenses amounted to 152,000 yuan. The purchasing offices of the Industry Bureaus of Shanxi and Pingyuan provinces in Shanghai made an average of more than 38 outgoing calls per telephone per hour during office hours. The waste of manpower in some units is also very serious. For example, the Changzhi Flour Mill in Shanxi Province sent a planner, a production section chief, a supply and marketing section chief, and the factory director, a total of four people, to Shanghai to purchase a 200-horsepower boiler, a 180-horsepower steam engine, and some other accessories and materials. The Shanxi Weaving Factory also has a similar situation.
    Relevant departments should immediately correct these serious instances of waste. (Zhang Weide)

    华北各地驻上海的某些采购单位
    严重浪费人力物力
    有关部门应当立即予以制止
    华北区驻上海联合购销处，最近深入了解了一下华北各省市派在上海采购单位的情况，发现不少严重的浪费现象。如天津振华染织厂采购员王蕴生，去年十一月份在上海只买了八百一十万元的东西，而其他费用就花了一百六十多万元，其中有招待费五十一万元，汽车、电车、三轮车费二十五万元，电话费九万一千六百元，长途电话费三十四万五千元，电灯费七万元，水费一万元，房租八万元。他还雇了一个工人，每月工资三十万元。平原省安阳县虹光电池厂采购员辛泰明，十一月正式业务支出只有二千八百一十八万八千三百五十元，而车费就支出了三十万零六千三百元，请客用了十五万二千元。山西、平原两省工业厅在上海的采购处，办公时间内平均每小时一个电话机要往外通话三十八次以上。有些单位人力的浪费也很严重，如山西省长治面粉厂，为了买一个二百马力的锅炉，一个一百八十马力蒸汽机和一些其他配件材料，就派了计划员、生产股长、供销科长、厂长四个人到上海。山西织造厂也有类似情况。
    对这些严重的浪费现象，有关部门应立即纠正。（张维德）
