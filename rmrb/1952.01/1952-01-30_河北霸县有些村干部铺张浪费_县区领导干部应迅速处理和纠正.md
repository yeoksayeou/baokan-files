To the Editor:

Following the bumper harvest in Ba County, Hebei Province last autumn, some village cadres and farmers have engaged in extravagance and waste when handling weddings and funerals, particularly the village cadres, who are the worst offenders. For example, Zhao Wencheng, the deputy village chief of Tuanjie Street in Xin’an Town, Third District, went to great lengths to show off when his third son got married, holding over 300 tables of banquets and hiring opera troupes, resulting in a deficit of over 3 million yuan. Shang Weizhen, the village chief of Gaoqiao Village, upon the death of his mother, saw how lively the funeral held by the village chief of Tianjiakou Village was, and thinking he would lose face if he didn’t make a big show of it himself, also engaged in large-scale extravagance. Cadres and masses from nearby villages all came to offer gifts, and even over 200 primary school students from the entire village wore "mourning headbands" to attend the feast. He made a fuss for four consecutive days, holding over 180 tables of banquets, using two bands for musical performances, and ten militiamen for security, resulting in a deficit of over 3 million yuan.

I suggest that county and district leaders pay serious attention to these matters and quickly persuade and stop the wasteful behavior of village cadres.

　　河北霸县有些村干部铺张浪费
    县区领导干部应迅速处理和纠正
    编辑同志：河北省霸县在去年秋季丰收以后，有的村干部和农民便在办理婚丧事情时铺张浪费，特别是村干部最严重。如三区信安镇团结街副村长赵文成，在他第三个儿子结婚时，极力耍排场，办了三百多桌酒席，还唱大戏，结果亏空了三百多万元。高桥村村长尚维珍死了母亲，他看到田家口村长给母亲出殡很热闹，认为自己不大闹一场，要丢面子，于是也大事铺张。附近村干部，群众都来送礼，连全村二百多个小学生，也都挂了“丧幛”去吃席。他一连闹了四天，办了一百八十多桌酒席，还用两班音乐演奏，十个民兵保卫，结果也亏空了三百多万元。
    我建议县、区领导干部对这些事情严重注意，迅速说服制止村干部的浪费现象。　　马熙敏
