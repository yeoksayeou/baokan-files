Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: According to TASS, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held a meeting on the 9th and approved the draft All-German National Assembly Election Law, drafted by a special committee organized by the government of the German Democratic Republic. It was decided to submit this draft to the Bonn Federal Assembly and the entire German people for discussion. The People's Chamber also suggested establishing an All-German Conference composed of representatives from East and West Germany to formulate the All-German election law, and appointed five representatives from the People's Chamber to participate in this conference.
    The draft All-German election law, drafted by the Government Election Law Drafting Committee, is divided into five chapters. The content is based on the 1924 Weimar election law and stipulates various political and legal guarantees to ensure the holding of free all-German elections. Among them, it is stipulated that all citizens who have reached the age of eighteen have the right to vote and all who have reached the age of twenty-one have the right to be elected. The election date and election law shall be announced by the East and West German governments three months before the election after being passed by the All-German Conference. A meeting of the All-German National Assembly must be convened no later than thirty days after the election. The personal freedom and safety of members of the National Assembly should be guaranteed. At the latest three months before the election, all restrictions on travel within Germany must be lifted.
    The Government Election Law Drafting Committee stated that it does not object to the establishment of a East-West German representative committee to investigate the conditions for holding elections throughout Germany, but it firmly opposes Germany giving up its right to decide its own internal affairs.
    The publication and approval of this draft election law has been warmly welcomed by the German people. Within hours of the People's Chamber meeting, working people from all over Germany sent telegrams expressing their support for the People's Chamber's resolution. Many newspapers in West Germany published news about the draft election law, even squeezing out Adenauer's fabricated slanders against the German Democratic Republic. Adenauer and his American and British masters were greatly embarrassed by this.
    Even within the West German ruling group, many senior officials have expressed their support for this draft election law. The Prime Minister of Bavaria, Erhard, a leader of the Christian Democratic Union (Adenauer's party), said at a press conference that he agreed with the People's Chamber's proposal to form an All-German Conference composed of representatives from East and West Germany, and that he was prepared to initiate the convening of this conference. Former German Chancellor Wirth also believes that all-German elections must be held.

    德意志民主共和国人民议会
    批准全德选举法草案
    全德各地人民表示热烈欢迎
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社讯：德意志民主共和国人民议会在九日举行会议，批准了由德意志民主共和国政府特别组织的委员会所起草的全德国民议会选举法草案，并决定把这个草案提交波恩联邦议会和全德人民讨论。人民议会同时建议，设立由东西德代表组成的全德会议，制定全德选举法，并任命人民议会的五个代表参加这个会议。
    德意志民主共和国政府委员会拟就的全德选举法草案共分五章，内容以一九二四年的魏玛选举法为基础，规定了确保全德自由选举得以举行的各项政治上和法律上的保障。其中规定凡年满十八岁的公民都享有选举权，年满二十一岁的公民都享有被选举权；选举日期和选举法经全德会议通过以后应由东西德政府在选举前三个月予以公布。至迟在选举后三十天之内，必须召开全德国民议会会议。国民议会议员的人身自由和安全应有保障。至迟在选举前三个月，必须取消在德国境内旅行的一切限制。
    政府选举法起草委员会表示不反对成立东西德代表委员会调查在全德举行选举的条件，但它坚决反对德国放弃自行决定本国内政的权利。
    这个选举法草案的公布和批准，受到了德国人民热烈的欢迎。在人民议会会议召开以后几小时，德国各地的劳动人民就纷纷打电报来表示支持人民议会的决议。西德许多报纸都刊载了关于选举法草案的消息，甚至把阿登纳经常捏造出来诽谤德意志民主共和国的消息都挤掉了。阿登纳和他的美英主子为此大感狼狈。
    甚至在西德统治集团内部，也有许多高级官员表示拥护这个选举法草案。巴伐利亚州总理、基督教民主党（阿登纳的党）领袖之一艾哈德在记者招待会上说，他同意人民议会主张由东西德代表组成全德会议的建议，他并且准备发起召开这一会议。前德国总理维尔特也认为，全德选举必须举行。
