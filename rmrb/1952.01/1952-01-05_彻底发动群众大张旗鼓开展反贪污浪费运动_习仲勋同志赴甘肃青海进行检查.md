    Thoroughly Mobilize the Masses and Vigorously Launch the Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste Campaign
    Comrade Xi Zhongxun Goes to Gansu and Qinghai for Inspection
    [News from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, personally inspected the progress of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Gansu Province and Qinghai Province from December 12 to 24 last year.

    After going through the steps of mobilization meetings, document study, ideological brewing, and preliminary inspection, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in provincial-level organs and financial and enterprise departments of Gansu and Qinghai provinces exposed many serious cases of corruption and waste, awakening those cadres who were originally paralyzed by the thought that "Gansu and Qinghai are backward areas with difficult living conditions, so there will be no corruption or waste." In some units, the movement had a good start because the person in charge took the initiative, held forums to express determination, eliminated some cadres' ideological concerns, and corrected some cadres' incorrect understanding of the movement. However, a mass movement has not yet formed in general organs.

    After listening to the reports from the responsible party member cadres of various departments in the two provinces, Xi Zhongxun instructed: To carry out the movement, the most important thing is that the leading cadres must have the determination to mobilize the masses and carry it out vigorously and with determination. It is necessary to promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and create a sense of hatred for corruption, waste, and bureaucracy among the broad masses. Mobilize the masses to inspect up and down, supervise each other, commend the good, and expose the bad. Xi Zhongxun said: Corruption and waste are equally serious in the Northwest. Corruption and waste are inseparable from bureaucracy. Bureaucrats often only satisfy themselves with achievements and dare not expose shortcomings.

    How will these elements that endanger the interests of the people be dealt with? Xi Zhongxun said: Those with serious circumstances should be severely punished, punishing a few and saving the majority. Those who confess thoroughly will be given lenient punishment for serious crimes and exemption from punishment for minor crimes. Those who are active in the movement and have made meritorious contributions to reporting will be commended. Those who have not engaged in corruption but do not take a serious attitude towards corruption must also be subjected to serious criticism.

    Xi Zhongxun asked the heads of organizations and units at all levels to earnestly lead this movement, not only to eliminate corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, but also to ensure that every cadre receives a good education in this movement and establishes a clean, simple, and people-serving revolutionary work style.

    Now, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CPC and the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the CPC have followed Xi Zhongxun's instructions, summarized the work of the previous stage, and formulated methods to strengthen leadership in the future.

    彻底发动群众大张旗鼓开展反贪污浪费运动
    习仲勋同志赴甘肃青海进行检查
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：中共中央西北局书记习仲勋去年十二月十二日到二十四日在甘肃省和青海省亲自检查了各该省反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开展的情形。
    甘肃、青海两省省级机关和财经、企业部门反对贪污、浪费和官僚主义的运动，经过动员大会、学习文件、思想酝酿和初步检查等步骤，暴露出许多严重的贪污、浪费事件，惊醒了那些原来以为“甘肃、青海地区落后，生活艰苦，不会有贪污、浪费情形”的思想麻痹的干部。有的单位，由于负责人亲自动手，召开座谈会表明决心，消除了某些干部的思想顾虑，纠正了某些干部对运动的不正确认识，因而使运动有了良好的开端。但是在一般机关中还没有形成群众性的运动。
    习仲勋在听取了这两个省的各部门党员负责干部的汇报以后，指示说：要开展运动，最主要的是领导干部要有决心，发动群众，大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地进行。要发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评，在广大群众中造成对贪污、浪费、官僚主义现象的憎恨心理。发动群众上下检查，互相监督，表扬好的，检举坏的。习仲勋说：贪污和浪费现象在西北一样是严重的。而贪污和浪费又是和官僚主义分不开的。官僚主义者往往只会满足成绩，不敢揭发缺点。
    对这些危害人民利益的分子将如何处理？习仲勋说：情节严重的要严厉惩办，惩办少数，挽救多数。彻底坦白者，重罪轻处，轻罪免处。在运动中表现积极和检举有功的，给以表扬。自己没有贪污行为，但对贪污现象不采取严肃态度的人，也必须对他们进行严肃的批评。
    习仲勋要求各级组织、各单位的负责人认真地领导这一运动，不仅要做到消灭贪污、浪费、官僚主义现象，并且要使每个干部在这一运动中受一次很好的教育，树立起廉洁、朴素、为人民服务的革命工作作风。
    现在中共甘肃省委员会和青海省委员会都已遵照习仲勋的指示，总结了前一阶段的工作，拟订了今后加强领导的办法。
