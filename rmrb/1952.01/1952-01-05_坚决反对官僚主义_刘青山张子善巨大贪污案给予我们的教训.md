Resolutely Oppose Bureaucracy
-- The Lessons We Learn from the Huge Embezzlement Case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan
Ma Guorui, Deputy Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC

Editor's Note: The Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC should bear considerable responsibility for the bureaucratic errors in its leadership work regarding the major embezzlement case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the CPC. The Liu and Zhang clique had been engaged in embezzlement and bribery for a year, and comrades in Tianjin, such as Li Kecai, had repeatedly reported and exposed them. However, this did not attract the attention of the Provincial Committee. The Provincial Committee made a mistake here, and it is necessary for the Provincial Committee to review this error. This review should have been done by Comrade Lin Tie, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, but due to Comrade Lin Tie's illness and convalescence, it is being done by Comrade Ma Guorui, Deputy Secretary, instead.

The exposure of the massive embezzlement case of Liu Qingshan, former Secretary of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee, and Zhang Zishan, the current Secretary, has provided a profound education for the vast number of party members and cadres in Hebei Province and has aroused vigilance among party organizations at all levels. The decision of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC to expel Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the party was quickly and enthusiastically supported by party members and cadres in institutions across the province. Even people who usually expressed indifference to political issues have been attracted and drawn into the discussion of this major case. This has a tremendous stimulating effect on the ongoing movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy throughout the province.

Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan were once relatively responsible cadres of the Party. They worked hard and established merits for the cause of the Party and the liberation of the people, and people once trusted them. They could have continued to do more for the Party and the people. However, in the peaceful environment of the two years since the victory of the national revolution, they degenerated and deteriorated due to their inability to withstand the invasion and temptation of bourgeois selfish and self-serving ideologies and practices. In order to pursue despicable and improper personal enjoyment, they disregarded national laws and party discipline and the suffering of the people, stealing 15.54954 billion yuan of state and people's property, using "institutional production" as a cover, colluding with unscrupulous merchants, and engaging in illegal business operations. They also unscrupulously engaged in bribery up and down, left and right, to corrupt the Party from within and disintegrate it. In this way, they became agents of reactionary elements within the Party and embarked on a path of betraying the Party, betraying the people, and ruining themselves, to be spurned by the entire Party and the broad masses of the people. This is a serious lesson for the Party organization in Hebei Province!

The reason why Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan's crimes of embezzlement, degeneration, and betrayal of the Party developed to such a serious extent was certainly mainly due to their serious individual selfish and self-serving thinking and their inability to resist the deception and corruption of the bourgeoisie, but it was also inseparable from the serious bureaucratic style of our provincial committee's leadership. Liu and Zhang's theft of state property and investment in "institutional production" began as early as 1950. Since the spring of 1951, they had been colluding with private merchants to engage in illegal business operations, working hand in glove to exploit river management laborers. However, our provincial committee's leadership had long been unaware of this. It is hard to believe and difficult to explain, but it is a fact. The seriousness of bureaucracy and its harm to the Party lie here. Although we heard some fragmented information about Liu and Zhang's extravagant lifestyle and their exclusion and suppression of cadres in August and September last year, and we criticized them several times, we did not pay attention to it because our political sensitivity was not sharp enough, and we thought it was a general problem, so we did not pursue it deeply and handle it seriously. In practice, this condoned their criminal activities. It was not until October last year, when Comrade Li Kecai told Comrade Xue Xun, Minister of the Provincial Committee's Organization Department, about some of Liu and Zhang's illegal and undisciplined acts, that we began to pay attention to it and began to focus on research and handling. Thanks to the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Party Central Committee, and the North China Bureau, we were able to discuss, expose, and criticize Liu and Zhang's crimes at the Third Congress of the Hebei Provincial Party, expel them from the Party, and request the Provincial People's Government to arrest them and bring them to justice. From this huge embezzlement case, we have deeply realized the seriousness and danger of the provincial committee's own bureaucracy. It has caused huge losses to the Party's influence and state resources. For this reason, we have conducted extremely painful and severe self-criticism and mobilized all representatives to criticize the bureaucratic style of the provincial committee's leadership. On December 18th last year, we also made a public self-criticism at the party member congress of the provincial directly affiliated institutions with a serious attitude. Recently, the Provincial Committee held another meeting to conduct self-examination and study the lessons this case has given us through in-depth examination.

As early as March 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee sounded the alarm to the entire Party, urging us to be vigilant against the danger of bourgeois ideological and behavioral corruption and invasion of the Party. The Second Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee clearly pointed out: "Because of victory, pride within the Party, a sense of being meritorious officials, stagnation and a lack of progress, and a desire for pleasure and unwillingness to live a hard life may grow." "There may be some communists who have not been conquered by enemies with guns, and they deserve the title of hero in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of bullets wrapped in sugar, and they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation." We turned a deaf ear to this wise instruction of the Party Central Committee, which shows that our political awareness is not high. It was not until October last year, when Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee put forward the great call for increasing production and practicing economy, and instructed the entire Party to launch a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and until Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan were defeated by sugar bullets and their own cases became huge sugar bullets corrupting the Party organization, that we suddenly woke up and were greatly shocked. In the past two years and eight months, we have been busy and hardworking, and we have done a lot of work for the people, but we have lacked sufficient understanding and estimation of the serious impact of the city's dazzling colors since entering the city, especially the impact of bourgeois ideology on the revolutionary ranks, corruption, and what it has done to party members and cadres. In the new environment, we did not foresee the new problems that might arise, so we lacked due vigilance against the pride, meritorious official mentality, stagnation and unwillingness to make progress, and the desire for pleasure and unwillingness to live a hard life, "comparing who is more generous," "comparing who is more magnanimous," and "comparing who is more ostentatious" that grew up within the Party because of victory; and the dust of bureaucracy made us paralyzed and negligent to the developing phenomena of extravagance, waste, corruption, and degeneration; we were unable to persist in the struggle against behaviors that violated and destroyed the system. This facilitated the intrusion of bourgeois ideological influence into the fighting Communist Party organization. This is the root cause of the existence and development of the Liu and Zhang incidents and many other illegal, undisciplined, corrupt, and degenerate behaviors. Therefore, the first lesson we should learn from the Liu and Zhang incident is that we must be highly vigilant at all times about the danger of bourgeois ideology corrupting us, vigorously strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership, strengthen the education of the entire Party in proletarian ideology and communism, draw a clear line between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and all non-proletarian ideologies, and resolutely purify and consolidate the Party ideologically, politically, and organizationally. , strengthen the Party's organization and discipline, and strengthen the education of abiding by laws and discipline among party members throughout the province.

The Provincial Committee also made bureaucratic errors in its cadre policy towards Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, which was manifested in a lack of understanding of them and inspection of their work. Understanding cadres and inspecting work are originally the Party's regular and important work, but we knew Liu and Zhang more from an upper perspective, and less from investigation and understanding below; similarly, we knew more about their work from oral and written reports, and less from in-depth and specific inspections; we paid even less attention to the shortcomings and errors in their work. This method of observing cadres and reviewing work one-sidedly will inevitably become "partial hearing and partial belief." The reason why Liu and Zhang were arrogant, suppressed democracy, disregarded the organization, disregarded laws and disciplines, used two-faced tactics, and did whatever they wanted was closely related to our bureaucratic partial hearing and partial belief, lack of inspection, failure to distinguish between right and wrong, and lax management and education. Comrade Stalin once said: "Review from top to bottom is far from including the entire review work. There is another review method, that is, review from bottom to top, that is to say, the masses, the people being led, review the leaders, point out their mistakes, and point out ways to correct these mistakes. This review is one of the most effective ways to review personnel." In our own work, we have precisely overlooked this principle. Therefore, in-depth and comprehensive understanding of cadres, adhering to the implementation of the inspection system, opposing subjective and one-sided partial hearing and partial belief, and opposing the bureaucratic style of only paying attention to deployment but not inspection of work, are the second serious lessons this incident has given us.

Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan have always adopted an extremely opposing attitude towards intra-party democracy. They wrongly turned the party committee system into a patriarchal system. Major issues were not brought to the party committee for discussion, but they made decisions arbitrarily, acted arbitrarily, canceled democracy, and regarded themselves as the only authority. They did not participate in party organizational life for a long time, and in fact formed special figures within the party, separated from the supervision of the masses. This is also one of the important reasons why Liu and Zhang's crimes developed to such a serious extent. The abnormal intra-party democratic life has a universal tendency in party organizations at all levels in Hebei Province. Therefore, it has also promoted the development of intra-party liberalism to a considerable extent. The fact that Liu and Zhang's crimes were hidden for a long time and were not resolutely and timely exposed is enough to illustrate the harm of liberalism. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the party committee system and the normal democratic life within the party, hold party representative meetings or congresses in the party organizations of institutions in a timely manner, carry out criticism and self-criticism seriously within the party, overcome bureaucracy, liberalism, and other bad ideas and bad styles; strictly implement the organizational life of party members and cadres, especially the responsible cadres of the party, humbly accept the supervision of the masses, listen to the opinions below, and strengthen the party spirit training of party members and cadres. This should be the third serious lesson that the Liu and Zhang incident has given us.

The lessons of the Liu and Zhang major embezzlement case are painful, and the responsibility borne by the Provincial Committee on this issue is serious. Our party leading organs at all levels and the party organizations throughout the province, down to every party member, must deeply remember these lessons, respond to the call of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee, and under the leadership of the North China Bureau, resolutely launch the movement to increase production and practice economy, resolutely launch the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, thoroughly eliminate the corrupt influence of the bourgeoisie reflected in the party, and resolutely overcome the bureaucratic style; Moreover, it must start from the leading organs first and implement it step by step to strive for further consolidating the party ranks politically, ideologically, and organizationally.

    坚决反对官僚主义
    ——刘青山张子善巨大贪污案给予我们的教训
    中共河北省委  副书记  马国瑞
    编者按：对于中共天津地委刘青山、张子善的大贪污案件，中共河北省委领导工作中的官僚主义错误，应负相当责任。刘、张小集团进行贪污、行贿已经一年之久，而天津地方同志如李克才等亦不断有过检举、报告，但终未引起省委注意，省委在这里是犯了错误的，省委对于这一错误的检讨是很必要的。这个检讨本应由省委书记林铁同志来作，因林铁同志患病休养，故由副书记马国瑞同志代作。
    前任天津地委书记刘青山、现任天津地委书记张子善巨大贪污案的揭发，使河北省广大党员干部受了一次极其深刻的教育，引起了各级党组织的警惕。中共河北省委开除刘青山、张子善党籍的决议，迅速地获得了全省各地机关党员干部的一致热烈拥护，连平素对于政治问题表示淡漠的人们也被吸引卷入到这个巨案的讨论中来。这对全省目前正在普遍开展着的反对贪污反对浪费反对官僚主义的运动，有巨大的推动作用。
    刘青山、张子善曾是党的比较负责的干部，他们为党的事业和人民解放事业曾经艰苦奋斗，树立过功绩，人们也曾信赖过他们。他们本来可以继续为党为人民作更多的事情。可是他们却在全国革命胜利后两年多以来的和平环境中，由于经不起资产阶级自私自利思想作风的侵袭和诱惑，而蜕化变质了。他们为贪图可鄙的不正当的个人享受，竟不顾国法党纪，不管人民疾苦，盗窃国家人民财产达一百五十五亿四千九百五十四万元，以“机关生产”作掩护，勾结奸商，进行非法经营；并肆无忌惮地在上下左右之间，公行贿赂，从内部来腐蚀党和瓦解党。他们就是这样成了反动分子在党内的代理人，走上了背叛党、背叛人民并使自己身败名裂为全党和广大人民所唾弃的绝路。这是河北省党组织的一个严重的教训！
    刘青山、张子善贪污、蜕化、叛党的罪行，所以发展到如此严重的地步，固然主要是由于他们个人严重的自私自利思想，经不起资产阶级的迷惑和腐蚀，但与我们省委领导上所犯的严重的官僚主义作风也是分不开的。刘、张盗窃国家财产投入“机关生产”远在一九五○年即已开始；一九五一年入春以来即勾结私商进行非法经营，狼狈为奸，剥削治河民工；而我们省委领导上竟长期无所闻，说来令人难以相信，自己也无以解说，然而却又是事实。官僚主义的严重性及其对党的危害就在这里。去年八、九月间，我们虽听到过刘、张生活铺张浪费，排斥、打击干部的一些片断情况，也曾向他们进行过数次批评，但由于我们政治嗅觉不灵，认为是一般性的问题，并未加以警惕，予以深追和认真处理。这样，在实际上就放纵了他们的罪恶活动。直到去年十月间，李克才同志向省委组织部长薛迅同志谈了刘、张若干违法犯纪的事实后，才引起我们的重视，并开始抓紧研究处理。由于毛泽东同志、党中央和华北局的领导，我们才在河北省党的第三次代表会议上讨论、揭发、批判了刘、张的罪行，并把他们开除出党，请省人民政府逮捕法办。从这个巨大贪污案件中，我们已深刻认识到省委本身官僚主义的严重性与危险性。它已使党的影响和国家资财遭受了巨大的损失。为此我们曾极其沉痛地进行了严厉的自我批评，发动全体代表批评了省委领导方面的官僚主义作风。去年十二月十八日我们又以严肃的态度在省直属机关党员大会上作了公开的自我批评。最近，省委又召开会议进行自我检讨，从深入检讨中，研究了这一案件所给予我们的教训。
    毛泽东同志和党中央早在一九四九年三月就向全党敲了警钟，要我们警惕资产阶级思想作风对于党的腐蚀、侵袭的危险性。党的二中全会曾明确指出：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”“可能有这样的一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”对于党中央这一英明的指示，我们竟置若罔闻，这说明了我们的政治觉悟是不高的。直到去年十月，毛泽东同志和党中央提出增产节约的伟大号召，并指示全党开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的时候，直到刘青山、张子善被糖弹打败而其自身也变为糖弹腐蚀党的组织的巨案被揭发的时候，我们才猛醒过来，大吃一惊。过去的两年零八个月，我们忙忙碌碌、辛辛苦苦，虽也为人民作了不少工作，但是我们对于入城以来，城市的五光十色，特别是对资产阶级思想对革命队伍的猛烈侵袭、腐蚀，所给予党员干部的严重影响，却缺乏足够的认识和估计。我们在新的环境下，预见不到可能要发生的新的问题，以致对党内因胜利而滋长起来的骄傲情绪，功臣自居情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，“比大方”“比慷慨”“比排场”的情绪，缺乏应有的警惕；而官僚主义的灰尘，又使我们对发展着的铺张浪费、贪污蜕化的现象，表现了麻痹、疏忽；对于违反破坏制度的行为，没有能够坚持斗争。这就便利了资产阶级的思想影响侵入到战斗的共产党的组织里面来。这就是刘、张事件以及很多违法乱纪腐化堕落行为之所以存在和发展的根本原因。因此，我们由刘、张事件所应当得到的第一个教训，就是必须时时刻刻高度警惕资产阶级思想对我们腐蚀的危险性，大力加强党的政治思想领导，加强全党无产阶级思想及共产主义的教育，划清无产阶级和资产阶级以及一切非无产阶级的思想界限，坚决地从思想上、政治上、组织上纯洁党、巩固党，加强党的组织性、纪律性，加强在全省党员中的奉公守法的教育。
    省委对刘青山、张子善在干部政策上，同样是犯了官僚主义的错误的，这表现在对他们缺乏了解和工作上的检查。了解干部、检查工作本来是党的经常的重要的工作，而我们对刘、张的认识从上面角度看的多，自下面考查了解少；同样，对他们的工作也是从口头文字报告了解多，深入具体的检查则很少；对于他们工作中的缺点和错误更是注意不够。这样片面地观察干部和审查工作的方法，实际上就不能不成为“偏听偏信”。刘、张之所以骄气横生，压制民主、目无组织、目无法纪、两面手法、为所欲为，是和我们官僚主义的偏听偏信、缺乏检查、是非不辨、管教不严，有密切关联的。斯大林同志曾说过：“从上而下的审查，还远不能包括整个审查工作。还有另外一种审查方法，即从下而上的审查，就是说，由群众，由被领导者来审查领导者，指出他们的错误，并指明改正这些错误的办法。这种审查，乃是审查人员的最有效办法之一。”我们在自己工作中，恰恰忽略了这一原则。因此，深入、全面的了解干部，坚持检查制度的执行，反对主观片面的偏听偏信，以及对工作只注意布置不注意检查的官僚主义作风，乃是这一事件给予我们的第二个严重教训。
    刘青山、张子善对党内民主一贯采取了极端反对的态度，他们把党委制错误地变为家长制。重大问题不拿到党委会讨论，擅自作主，独断专行，取消民主，唯我独尊。他们长期不过党的组织生活，实际上形成党内的特殊人物，脱离了群众的监督。刘、张的罪行所以发展到如此严重，这也是重要的原因之一。党内民主生活的不正常，在河北省党的各级组织中，是带有普遍性的倾向。因而也就相当地助长了党内自由主义倾向的发展。刘、张的罪行长久隐匿而没有被坚决及时揭发出来，也足以说明自由主义的危害了。因此，必须加强党委制和党内正常的民主生活，在机关党的组织中适时举行党的代表会议或代表大会，在党内严肃的开展批评与自我批评，克服官僚主义、自由主义、以及其他坏思想、坏作风；严格党员干部特别是党的负责干部的组织生活，虚心地接受群众的监督，倾听下面的意见，以加强党员干部的党性锻炼。这应当是刘、张事件给予我们的第三个严重教训。
    刘、张大贪污案的教训是沉痛的，省委在这个问题上所负的责任是严重的。我们各级党的领导机关和全省党的组织，直至每一个党员，必须深刻记取这些教训，响应毛泽东同志和党中央的号召，在华北局领导下，坚决开展增产节约运动，坚决开展反对贪污、反对浪费和反对官僚主义的斗争，彻底肃清反映到党内来的资产阶级的腐化影响，坚决克服官僚主义作风；而且，必须首先从领导机关作起，逐级切实贯彻，为从政治上、思想上、组织上进一步巩固党的队伍而奋斗。
