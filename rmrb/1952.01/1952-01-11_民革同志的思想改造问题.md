Since the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference unanimously decided to continue strengthening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, promote and advance the patriotic movement of increasing production and practicing economy, and extensively carry out the ideological remolding movement as the central tasks for the people of the whole country in the coming period, the people of the whole country have warmly supported and are willing to work hard to carry out this great work. These three central tasks are inextricably linked, among which the ideological remolding movement is a huge driving force for doing a good job in resisting America, aiding Korea, and increasing production and practicing economy. Therefore, the discussions on ideological remolding have been very enthusiastic recently, and the scope of the discussions has been very broad. All democratic classes and democratic parties are discussing how to carry out ideological remolding in order to improve themselves and fulfill their due tasks in the new democratic construction, according to their actual situations. Therefore, here, I would also like to offer some opinions on the issue of ideological remolding based on the actual situation of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

First, the issue of guiding ideology—this is the fundamental issue of understanding in ideological remolding. Should the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang take the revolutionary Three People's Principles as its guiding ideology, or should it take the New Democracy as its guiding ideology? This should be clarified very clearly. In the past, there was indeed some ambiguity about the issue of guiding ideology. For example, it was said that "the development of the revolutionary Three People's Principles has converged with New Democracy at the present stage," which led people to mistakenly believe that the revolutionary Three People's Principles and New Democracy were things that could be on par. In December 1950, the Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang determined that "the thought of New Democracy is the guiding ideology of our party," which was a major progress in the theoretical understanding of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang.

Indeed, in the past, the revolutionary Three People's Principles played a positive role in educating and improving the understanding of Sun Yat-sen's followers. Sun Yat-sen's followers adhered to the three major policies and the revolutionary proposition of "land to the tillers" and waged unyielding struggles against Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime. In the Chinese revolutionary movement, the revolutionary Three People's Principles had a certain progressive nature. But today is already the era of New Democracy. Sun Yat-sen's proposed "alliance with Russia" is now the "leaning to one side" policy; the so-called "alliance with the Communist Party" is now the Chinese Communist Party as the leading party; and the so-called "support for farmers and workers" means that today's New China is led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. The revolutionary Three People's Principles are only close to New Democracy, but not equal to New Democracy. The two are different in terms of theoretical viewpoints and ideological methods.

It is undeniable that the ideological remnants of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, especially the remnants of feudal ideology, still exist within the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang. This is reflected in the ideological struggles within the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, which are almost all directed at the remnants of feudal ideology. These enemy ideologies are unacceptable and must be eliminated with all our efforts. This is one aspect. On the other hand, those comrades in the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang who still adhere to the ideological system of the revolutionary Three People's Principles should not be complacent and limit their own progress. We must raise the perceptual knowledge of the new society to the stage of rational knowledge. We should learn from Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit of constantly pursuing progress and strive to learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and understand the problems of the Chinese revolution with the stand, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism. In a new democratic society, there can be no other guiding ideology besides New Democracy. Therefore, studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which combines with the actual situation of the Chinese revolution, is the basic work in our ideological remolding today.

Secondly, the question of how to understand the past and understand ourselves. In the struggle against Chiang Kai-shek, the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang achieved certain results in accelerating the victory of the Chinese revolution, whether in military or political terms. However, because we did not know how to combine with the masses of the people, did not have a clear political line, and even had internal wavering and betrayal elements, and at the same time, we did not know how to arm ourselves with the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, we had to end each anti-Chiang struggle with failure. The failure of the Fujian People's Government is a typical example. It was not until August 1, 1935, when the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call for "all parties, factions, and compatriots throughout the country to jointly resist Japan and save the country," that the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang truly found the road of the Chinese revolution. The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang played a certain role in the united front gradually formed under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "To win the victory of China's new democratic revolution, it is impossible without a broadest united front including the overwhelming majority of the population of the whole nation. Not only that but also this united front must be under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Without strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, any revolutionary united front cannot win victory." Obviously, without the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the unity and struggle in the united front, and advancing in unity under a common goal, the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang would not be able to exert and contribute its strength, and would not be able to achieve anything. When describing the history of the struggle of the democratic faction of the Kuomintang, we must not forget the leading role of the Chinese Communist Party in the united front. Therefore, we can only estimate ourselves based on the tasks of the united front, so as not to overestimate ourselves, carry the burden of progress, be arrogant, and correctly understand our past history, in order to recognize our responsibilities today.

Looking at the democratic faction of the Kuomintang as a whole, although it has gone through many twists and turns, the basic direction is still progressive. However, from the perspective of individual members, the degree of progress is not very consistent. Some progress very quickly, some progress very slowly, some seem to be progressive but are actually not very progressive, and some are very progressive in words but not very progressive in actions. So when talking about ideological remolding, we must first relate it to our own reality. In other words, we must use the theoretical mirror of Marxism-Leninism to examine ourselves. Especially today, we should examine ourselves to see if we have fulfilled our due responsibilities in the three major movements of resisting America, aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. To be more specific, whether we have committed corruption, waste, or bureaucracy in our work and life. Only by combining with the specific reality of action, measuring ourselves, and pursuing the root of our thoughts can we truly understand ourselves and improve ourselves.

Furthermore, the issue of distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy, and consolidating and developing the organization of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang. The Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang is a member of the people's democratic united front. Therefore, the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang must not only eliminate the lurking bad elements in action, but also strengthen the education of the united front and improve the ideological understanding of distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy. A true revolutionary fighter has a firm and ruthless attitude towards the enemy; if he is an onlooker, his attitude towards the enemy is different; as for those who do not come into contact with revolutionary life, the boundary between ourselves and the enemy may sometimes become blurred. Therefore, in the ideological remolding movement, we must eliminate those vulgar and personal prejudices and sentiments. We must abandon personal interests to obey the interests of the entire united front. We cannot only plan for our classmates, fellow villagers, colleagues, subordinates, and relatives, but not for the organization of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang. Since the Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee, the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang has expelled nearly two hundred bad elements from the party. In terms of consolidating and developing the organization, we should be so resolute. But this is not enough. The main problem is: whether the issue of distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy within the party has been resolved ideologically. If we examine it, more than 70% of the expelled people have quite serious political problems, and most of them were discovered after being arrested by government agencies. For example, in the movement to confess history, people's opinions on the handling of the elements to be dealt with were also very inconsistent. Why is this so? This clearly shows that some people in the party still have some problems in distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy.

The issue of distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy is a matter of revolutionary stand. The enemy is the enemy, and friends are friends, and they should be clearly distinguished. Since the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries and the movement to confess history, to this day, if our comrades in the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang can examine themselves and see whether their past words and deeds have more or less made mistakes and adversely affected the organization of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, it will be helpful for their ideological remolding.

Finally, let's talk about the issue of work style. The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang who came from the old society brought many bad habits and old styles, especially some bad habits and old styles left over from the old Kuomintang. Some people regard themselves as amazing heroes, looking down on everything, thinking that everything they do is right and others are wrong. Some people have a particularly strong sense of liberalism, not knowing what the organization is. Once it is related to personal interests, even trivial matters can cause unnecessary disputes. As for the bureaucratic and commandist style, it still exists quite seriously within the party. If these old styles continue to exist, we will fall into unnecessary noise and unprincipled personnel disputes, and we will not be able to promote the progress of the entire Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang.

The quality of the work style will affect the unity within the party. To improve our own work style, we must first have a thorough understanding of the united front policy and sincerely do a good job in uniting. We must remember that even if there is struggle, it is for the sake of unity. We must concentrate our energy on work and on serving the people, and not be preoccupied with personal gains and losses. The work of unity can be done well. In the past year, many members of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Youth League have joined the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, and many outstanding cadres in the government agencies have also joined the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang. This new blood has a driving effect on the improvement of our work style, and we should learn from them. We should pay attention to checking our own work style in the ideological remolding movement. Whether the ideological remolding of an individual or a political party has achieved results, there is no need to look at anything else, but to see if his work style has changed. The times are constantly progressing. If we still retain the old work style that is disgusting, we will not be able to do a good job in uniting, and we will not be able to lead and drive the party members and the masses to move forward.

Today, when we carry out ideological remolding, we must first carry it out consciously and voluntarily, and not perfunctorily in word but not in deed. Therefore, we must first be humble and have a sincere learning attitude. If we have shortcomings, we should frankly expose them and not hide our shortcomings and deceive ourselves. It is glorious to correct our shortcomings in order to better serve the people. If we don't understand, we should say that we don't understand, and not pretend or pretend to understand, and sincerely learn from others. It is also glorious to study humbly and improve ourselves in order to better serve the people. Second, learning Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought must be related to the actual situation of our own thoughts and actions. Use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as a yardstick to measure ourselves and see if what we say is what we do. At the same time, we must also use the yardstick of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to examine the past history and see what kind of person we were in the past, whether we have made contributions to the country and the revolution, or whether we have made no contributions, so that it is easier to recognize ourselves and improve ourselves. Third, earnestly use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. To make ourselves progress and to make the whole party progress, the best method is criticism and self-criticism. As Chairman Mao said: "This is a very good method, a very good method to promote everyone to adhere to the truth and correct mistakes, and the only correct method for all revolutionary people in the people's country to conduct self-education and self-transformation." Now, the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang has also initially used the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. In the future, we must continue to use this weapon and not be afraid of being embarrassed or having any concerns about that vulgar attitude.

The above three points are also some of my own experiences in ideological remolding. I myself also had some shortcomings in the past. The most prominent ones were narrow-mindedness, individual heroism, and sometimes being too arbitrary and acting alone. I did not do a very good job in uniting. These shortcomings only have disadvantages to work and will not have any advantages. In the past two years, I have often paid attention to myself in actual work, and I feel that learning Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is an arduous process of ideological struggle. In the constant pursuit of progress, it is possible to approach the truth step by step and correct our own shortcomings step by step. I often think like this: All those who are strong and brave, constantly pursue the truth, pursue the light, and are determined to serve the people wholeheartedly will not fall in this arduous ideological remolding movement and will definitely reach the peak of their ideals.

    民革同志的思想改造问题
    谭平山
    自从中国人民政协全国委员会第三次会议，一致决定以继续加强抗美援朝运动，提倡和推动爱国主义增产节约运动及广泛开展思想改造运动为今后一个时期全国人民的中心工作之后，全国人民热烈拥护，愿意为进行此伟大的工作而努力。这三个中心工作是有着不可分割的关系的，其中思想改造运动，尤为做好抗美援朝，增产节约的巨大动力。因此，近来关于思想改造的讨论，非常热烈，而讨论的范围，也非常广泛。各民主阶层，各民主党派都按照其实际情况，讨论如何进行思想改造以便提高自己，使能在新民主主义建设中，尽其应尽的任务。所以，在这里，我也就中国国民党革命委员会的实际情况，对于思想改造问题，提出一些意见。
    首先，关于领导思想的问题——这是思想改造的根本认识的问题。民革以革命的三民主义为领导思想呢，还是以新民主主义为领导思想呢？这是应该十分鲜明的明确起来的。过去对于领导思想的问题，的确有些模糊，例如“确认革命的三民主义之发展，在现阶段已与新民主主义汇流”，使人误认为革命的三民主义和新民主主义是并驾齐驱的东西。一九五○年十二月民革二届二中全会时，确定“新民主主义的思想就是本党的领导思想”，是民革在理论认识上的一大进步。
    不错，在过去，革命的三民主义，对于中山先生的信徒，的确起了教育和提高认识的积极作用。中山先生的信徒坚持着三大政策及“耕者有其田”的革命主张，和蒋介石反动政权进行过不屈的斗争。在中国革命运动中，革命的三民主义是有一定的进步性的。但是今天已经是新民主主义时代了。中山先生所提出的“联俄”，今天已是“一边倒”的政策了；所谓“联共”，今天是以中国共产党为领导党了；所谓“扶助农工”，今天新中国是以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础了。革命的三民主义只接近新民主主义，并不等于新民主主义，这两者在理论观点，思想方法上，都是不相同的。
    不可否认，在民革党内，还存留着的帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的思想残余，特别是封建思想的残余。这表现在民革内部的思想斗争上，差不多都是对着封建思想残余来开刀的。这些敌人的思想，是要不得的，是要尽全力加以肃清的。这是一方面。另一方面，民革同志中有些还牢守着革命的三民主义思想体系的，也就不要故步自封，限制了自己的进步。我们要将新社会的感性认识，提到理性认识的阶段上来，我们应当学习孙中山先生不断追求进步的革命精神，来努力学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，以马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法来理解中国的革命问题。在新民主主义社会里，除了新民主主义，不可能有别的领导思想。所以，学习马克思列宁主义与中国革命实际相结合的毛泽东思想，是我们今天改造思想中的基本工作。
    其次，关于如何认识过去，认识自己的问题。民革同志在反对蒋介石的斗争中，不论在军事上或政治上，对于加速中国革命的胜利，是有一定的成绩的。但是，由于我们不晓得和人民大众相结合，没有明确的政治路线，甚至内部还存在着动摇叛变分子，同时，我们又不懂得以马克思列宁主义的思想武器，来武装自己，结果不得不以失败而结束每次的反蒋斗争。福建人民政府的失败，就是一个典型的例子。一直到一九三五年八月一日中共中央发出“各党各派及全国同胞共同抗日救国”的号召之后，民革的同志，才真正地找到中国革命的道路，民革同志才在中共领导下逐渐形成的统一战线中，起着一定的作用。正如毛主席所指出：“中国新民主主义的革命要胜利，没有一个包括全民族绝大多数人口的最广泛的统一战线，是不可能的。不但如此，这个统一战线还必须是在中国共产党的坚强的领导之下。没有中国共产党的坚强的领导，任何革命统一战线也是不能胜利的。”很明显地，如果没有中共的正确领导，在统一战线中，又斗争又团结，在共同目标下，团结前进，民革同志也就不能发挥和贡献它的力量，就不能有所成就。在叙述国民党民主派的斗争历史的时候，一点也不能忘记在统一战线中中国共产党的领导作用，因此我们也唯有在统一战线的任务上来估计自己，才不致把自己估价过高，背着进步的包袱，妄自尊大，正确认识自己过去的历史，才能认识自己在今天应尽的责任。
    将国民党民主派作为一个整体来看，虽然它走过许多曲折的道路，基本的方向，还是进步的。但是，从各个个别分子来说，进步的程度，却不很一致，有的进步得很快，有的进步得很慢，有的貌似进步而事实上却很不进步，有的口头上很进步，而行动上很不进步的，各色各样都有。所以谈思想改造的时候，首先要联系到自己的实际，换句话说，就是拿马克思列宁主义的理论镜子，来照照自己。特别在今天，更要自己检查一下，在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命的三大运动中，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，自己尽了应尽的责任没有，再具体一点说，自己在工作生活中，犯了贪污、浪费、官僚主义的毛病没有，结合着行动的具体实际，来衡量自己，来追求思想根源，才能真正地认识自己，才能提高自己。
    复次，关于分清敌我界限，巩固和发展民革组织的问题。民革是人民民主统一战线的成员之一，因此，民革的内部不但要在行动上肃清潜伏着的坏分子，而且还要加强统一战线教育，提高分清敌我的思想认识。一位真正的革命战士，对敌人的态度，是坚决无情的；如果是一位袖手旁观者，对敌人的态度，就两样了；至于那些不和革命生活接触的人，连敌我的界限，有时都会模糊起来的。所以，在思想改造运动中，我们要清除那些庸俗的、私人的偏见和温情，我们要放弃私人的利益去服从整个统一战线的利益，不能专为自己的同学、同乡、同事、部属、亲戚打算，而不替民革组织打算；民革自二中全会以来开除出党的不良分子，将近有二百人。在巩固和发展组织的工作上看，我们是应当如此坚决的，但这还不够，主要的问题是：在思想上，是不是解决了党内的分清敌我界限的问题。我们检查一下，在被开除的人数比例中，有百分之七十以上是有相当严重的政治问题的，而且多数是在被政府机关逮捕之后，才发觉的。又如在交代历史运动中，有些人对应处理的分子的处理，意见也很不一致。为什么会这样呢？这很明显地，说明党内有些人对分清敌我界限上，多少还存在着一些问题。
    分清敌我界限问题，是关系革命立场的问题，敌人是敌人，朋友是朋友，应当分别得清清楚楚。自镇压反革命运动及交代历史运动以后，到今天，我们民革同志，如果能够自己检查一下，看过去的言行，是否多多少少犯有错误，使民革组织受了不良影响，这对于自己的思想改造，是有帮助的。
    最后，且谈谈工作作风问题。来自旧社会的民革同志，带来了好些坏习气和旧作风，特别是一些旧国民党遗留下来的坏习气和旧作风。有些人把自己看成了不起的英雄，目空一切，一切都是自己对，别人不对。有些人自由主义特别浓厚，不知组织为何物，一遇到和私人利益有关，那怕是微不足道的小事，也引起无谓争执。至于官僚主义，命令主义的作风，在党内还相当严重地存在着。如果让这些旧作风继续存在，我们就会陷于无谓的噪闹，无原则的人事纠纷上去，就不能推动整个民革向前进步。
    作风的好坏，是会影响到党内的团结的。要改好自己的作风，首先就要有对统一战线政策的彻底认识，要诚心诚意地做好团结工作。要记得即使有斗争，也是为了团结。我们要把精力多集中于工作、于为人民服务上去，不要斤斤计较于个人的利害得失，团结工作是可以做好的。一年以来，好些中共党员及青年团员加入了民革，不少优秀的机关在职干部，也加入了民革。这批新血液，对于我们工作作风的改进，是有推动的作用的，应当向他们学习。我们要在改造思想运动中，着重注意检查自己的作风。个人的或政党的思想改造，是否有成绩，不必要再看别的，一看他的作风是否有所改变就差不多了。时代是不断进步的，如果我们还保留着令人憎嫌的旧作风，我们就不能做好团结工作，就不能领导带动党员群众向前进步。
    我们今天进行思想改造，首先是要自觉地自愿地进行，并不是口是心非地去敷衍，因此，首先就要谦虚，有真心诚意的学习态度。自己有缺点，就坦坦白白地暴露出来，不要把自己的缺点掩藏起来，自欺欺人。为了更好地为人民服务而改正自己的缺点是光荣的。自己不懂得，就说不懂得，不要冒充，不要装懂，要诚恳地向别人学习。为了更好地为人民服务而虚心学习，提高自己，这也是光荣的。第二，学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，必须联系自己思想行动的实际。以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想做一个量度自己的尺度，看自己口里说的那一套，是不是自己做的那一套。同时，我们也要把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的尺度，检查一下过去的历史，看自己过去是怎样的一个人物，对国家对革命有贡献呢，还是没有什么贡献，这样才更容易认识自己，提高自己。第三，认真运用批评和自我批评的武器。要自己进步，要全党进步，最好的方法，就是批评和自我批评，正如毛主席所说：“这是一个很好的方法，是推动大家坚持真理、修正错误的很好的方法，是人民国家内全体革命人民进行自我教育和自我改造的唯一正确的方法。”现在民革党内也已初步地运用批评和自我批评的武器了，以后我们还要不断地运用这个武器，不要害怕碍于情面，有所顾虑的那种庸俗态度。
    以上三点，也是我自己对于思想改造的一点心得。我自己过去也很有一些缺点，最特出的就是胸襟狭隘，个人英雄主义，有时过于独断独行，对于团结工作，做得很不够细致。这些毛病，对工作只有坏处，不会有好处的。这两年以来，我在实际工作中，时常留心自己，心里觉得学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，是一个思想斗争的艰苦的过程。在不断追求进步要求中，是能一步一步接近真理的，是能一步一步改正自己的毛病的。我经常这样想：凡是坚强勇敢，不断追求真理，追求光明的人，决心全心全意为人民服务的人，在这艰苦的思想改造运动中，一定不会跌倒，一定能达理想的高峰。
