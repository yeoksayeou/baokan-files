The Qingdao Sanatorium of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Should Immediately Investigate Extravagance and Waste

From March to December of last year, I was recuperating at the Qingdao Sanatorium of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions due to illness. During those eight months, I witnessed serious extravagance and waste and bureaucratic phenomena at this sanatorium.

The Qingdao Sanatorium of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has seventeen buildings for recuperation and office use. When these seventeen buildings were constructed in 1950, all the windows were fitted with brand new light yellow scrim curtains with a square pattern, made of a blend of wool and cotton. The quality of these curtains was very good. However, in July 1951, when the sanatorium came under the leadership of the Labor Insurance Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, all the curtains were replaced with light blue Shandong silk. Last autumn, the sanatorium tore up the batch of curtains that had been replaced, which were completely new or eight or nine-tenths new, and used the strips to wrap water pipes and heating pipes. When I asked the person in charge of the sanatorium why they were doing this, he replied: "Things are extremely chaotic here. Up to now, we haven't been able to find out who approved this!" Last summer, the sanatorium arbitrarily used several million yuan of public funds to open a so-called "Supply Store" for the organization’s production without approval from higher authorities, and even posted large advertisements in the name of the sanatorium. Although this store was ordered to close down shortly after it opened, it caused great losses to the state's finances. The sanatorium also demonstrated a bureaucratic style of work that was irresponsible towards financial and human resources in the management of vegetable cultivation. They only knew how to invest, and did not pay attention to management, so that some vegetable plots could not even recover the cost of the seeds.

I believe that the extravagance and waste and the bureaucratic phenomena in financial management at the Qingdao Sanatorium of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions are very serious. I hope that the Qingdao Sanatorium of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and its relevant higher-level departments will thoroughly investigate these phenomena.

### 中华全国总工会青岛疗养所应即检查铺张浪费现象

    中华全国总工会青岛疗养所应即检查铺张浪费现象
    从去年三月到十二月，我因病在中华全国总工会青岛疗养所休养。八个多月中，我在这个疗养所看到了严重的铺张浪费和官僚主义现象。
    中华全国总工会青岛疗养所共有十七所供休养和办公用的楼房。在一九五○年修建这十七所楼房时，一律做了崭新的浅黄色的带方格的牛毛和棉花混纺的纱窗帘。本来这批窗帘的质量很好，可是，到一九五一年七月，疗养所改由中华全国总工会劳动保险部领导时，又把窗帘全部换成浅蓝色山东绸的。到去年秋天，所中把换下来的完全新的和八、九成新的那批窗帘，撕成布条，缠了水管子和暖气管子。当时我问这个疗养所负责人为什么这样做？他回答我说：“我们这里可乱极了。到现在，这件事是谁批准的，还找不出来呢！”疗养所在去年夏天，没有经过上级批准，就任意动用公款好几百万，开设所谓机关生产“供给商店”，还用疗养所名义，大贴广告。这个商店，虽然在开设后不久，就被命令停业了，但给国家财政上造成了很大的损失。这个疗养所在经营种菜的生产上，也表现了对财力、人力不负责任的官僚主义作风。只知投资，不注意经营管理，有的菜圃竟连菜籽钱都收不回来。
    我认为中华全国总工会青岛疗养所的铺张浪费和在财政管理上的官僚主义现象是很严重的。我希望中华全国总工会青岛疗养所和它的上级有关部门应该深入检查这些现象。　　　　　　　王敬
