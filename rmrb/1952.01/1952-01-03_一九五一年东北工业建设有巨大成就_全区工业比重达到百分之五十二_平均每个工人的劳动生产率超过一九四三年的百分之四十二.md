    Northeast China achieved great success in industrial construction in 1951. According to preliminary statistics, the production capacity of the state-owned industrial system in Northeast China increased by another 31 percent based on 1950. Adding the local industries of various provinces and cities, the proportion of industry in the overall economy of Northeast China increased from 35 percent in 1949 to 52 percent. Several light and heavy industries, such as machine manufacturing, electrical machinery manufacturing, electric furnace steel, electrolytic copper, nitric acid, textiles, glass, light bulbs, and automobile tires, have exceeded the highest production level before the liberation of Northeast China in 1943.
    The rapid increase in labor productivity of workers in Northeast China fully demonstrates the superiority of the New Democratic system. In 1951, the average labor productivity per worker exceeded 1943 by 42 percent. The increase in labor productivity of coal miners was even faster. In 1943, an average miner extracted 111 tons of raw coal. In 1951, the average was over 247 tons, with labor productivity exceeding 1943 by 123 percent. With the development of production and the increase in labor productivity of workers, the wage income of employees in Northeast China also increased. Taking the average wage of employees at the end of 1949 as 100, it increased to 124.71 percent by July 1951.
    In 1951, factory and mine workers launched an unprecedented patriotic production increase and economy drive. In this movement, workers "tapped potential" and "found tricks" with boundless enthusiasm, learned advanced Soviet technology and experience, thereby strengthening the management of enterprises and solving many major technical problems. For example, due to the promotion of high-speed cutting and multi-tool multi-edge cutting methods in the machinery industry, the highest production efficiency has become more than 20 times that of the past. A certain iron smelting plant improved the utilization rate of the effective volume of the blast furnace, so that the average monthly iron production increased by 32 percent compared with the past, and the quality also continued to improve. After several power plants successfully test-burned low-quality coal for power generation, they saved a total of 400,000 tons of good coal for the country throughout the year. After the Benxi Power Plant used low-quality coal for power generation, the cost per kilowatt of electricity was reduced by more than 50 percent.
    The continuous improvement of technology and the strengthening of business management in Northeast China's industry have continuously unleashed the potential strength within the industry. As of the end of November, public-owned enterprises (including the Northeast Railway System), in addition to completing the original production plan, also increased production and saved wealth equivalent to 13 million tons of grain. This production increase and economy drive has not only accumulated huge funds for national economic construction, but also provided considerable experience for future industrial construction.

    一九五一年东北工业建设有巨大成就
    全区工业比重达到百分之五十二
    平均每个工人的劳动生产率超过一九四三年的百分之四十二
    一九五一年，东北工业建设获得伟大的成就。据初步统计，东北国营工业系统的生产能力，在一九五零年的基础上又上升了百分之三十一。加上各省市地方工业，全东北工业占国民经济的比重已由一九四九年的百分之三十五增加到百分之五十二。若干轻、重工业如机器制造、电机制造、电炉钢、电解铜、硝酸、纺织、玻璃、灯泡、汽车内外胎等，都已超过东北解放前生产水平最高年度一九四三年的水平。
    东北工人劳动生产率的迅速增涨，充分证明了新民主主义制度的优越性。一九五一年平均每个工人的劳动生产率，已超过一九四三年的百分之四十二。其中煤矿工人劳动生产率的增涨更快，一九四三年平均每个矿工采出原煤一百十一吨，一九五一年平均就采出二百四十七吨以上，劳动生产率超过一九四三年百分之一百二十三。随着生产的发展和工人劳动生产率的提高，东北职工的工资收入也增加了。如以一九四九年底的职工平均工资为一百，到一九五一年七月就增加到了百分之一百二十四点七一。
    各厂矿职工在一九五一年开展了空前规模的爱国增产节约运动。在这个运动中，职工们以无限的热情“挖潜力”、“找窍门”，学习苏联先进的技术和经验，因而加强了企业的经营管理工作，并解决了许多重大的技术问题。如机械工业因高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法的推广，生产效率最高的已等于过去的二十倍以上。某炼铁厂提高了高炉有效容积的利用率，使每月铁的产量平均比过去增加百分之三十二，质量也不断提高。若干发电厂试烧劣等煤发电成功后，全年共为国家节省好煤四十万吨。本溪发电厂用劣等煤发电后，每个电字的成本降低了百分之五十以上。
    东北工业的技术不断改进，经营管理不断加强，已使工业内部的潜在力量不断发挥出来。截至十一月底的统计，公营各企业（包括东北铁路系统）在完成原订生产计划之外，并增产节约了价值等于一千三百万吨粮食的财富。这次增产节约运动不仅为国家经济建设积累了巨额资金，并为今后工业建设提供了相当丰富的经验。  （新华社）
