Respected Chairman Mao: We attended the county-wide labor model conference in December of last year and summarized our production experience over the past year. Looking back, the working people suffered all kinds of oppression. Who could work hard in production? In the past, for many years, we produced eight dou of wheat and ninety jin of cotton per mu, which was considered a good harvest, the peak of production. But after the land reform and the patriotic abundance movement, our yields have greatly increased. According to the statistics of the one hundred and twenty-two people who attended the meeting this time, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, they planted a total of 2,497.2 mu of wheat, with an average yield of 7 dou and 2.5 sheng per mu; they planted a total of 159 mu of cotton, with an average yield of 89 jin per mu. In 1951, the yield per unit area had increased considerably, with each mu of wheat yielding more than 1 shi, and each mu of cotton yielding 130.5 jin. Among them, 160 mu of high-yield wheat fields averaged 1 shi and 8 dou and 4 sheng per mu, and 14.4 mu of high-yield cotton fields averaged 327 jin per mu. Qu Yinshan's cotton yielded 454 jin per mu, reaching the county's highest record for high-yield cotton; Fan Zhaoshan improved the mountainous land and planted cotton on a trial basis, yielding 360 jin per mu, breaking the traditional saying that "mountainous land is not suitable for cotton planting"; Wang Yaosan carefully cultivated and fertilized more, with each mu of wheat yielding 435 jin, three times higher than the general yield. We realize that the reason we can achieve such high yields is mainly because the working people have been emancipated and become masters of the country, and the enthusiasm for production has been continuously improved.

In 1952, we must resolutely respond to your call for increasing production and practicing economy, and do the following: 1. Develop 266 mutual aid teams in the spring, and on this basis, promote the abundance movement throughout the county; in production, we must be particularly careful and economical, and save labor; 2. Do not be extravagant and wasteful in weddings, funerals, and celebrations; 3. Learn from Qu Yaoli to increase the unit area yield of cotton, and create a high-yield record of harvesting 500 to 550 jin of cotton per mu. In addition, we must study culture hard and resolutely implement the Marriage Law. We guarantee that what is written in the letter can be realized, and we will use these conditions to challenge the Li Shunda mutual aid team.

    山西万泉一百五十个劳动模范
    决心在春季大量发展互助组  推动丰产运动提高棉花产量
    敬爱的毛主席：我们在去年十二月间出席全县劳动模范大会，总结了一年来的生产经验。回忆过去，劳动人民受尽欺凌，谁还能努力生产呢？过去多少年来，我们每亩麦子生产八斗，每亩棉花生产九十斤，就算是丰收了，生产到顶了。但是经过土地改革，经过爱国丰产运动，我们的产量已大大提高。根据这次参加会议的一百二十二人的材料统计，抗日战争前共种麦子二千四百九十七亩二分，每亩产量平均七斗二升五；共种棉花一百五十九亩，每亩平均产八十九斤。一九五一年单位面积产量已相当提高，每亩麦子产一石多，每亩棉花产一百三十斤半。其中一百六十亩丰产麦田，平均每亩产到一石八斗四，丰产棉田十四亩四分，平均每亩产到三百二十七斤。屈银山的棉花每亩产四百五十四斤，达到全县丰产棉花的最高纪录；樊兆山改良山地试种棉花，每亩也产到三百六十斤，打破了“山地不宜植棉”的传统说法；王耀三精耕细作多施肥，每亩麦子产到四百三十五斤，比一般产量高出三倍。我们认识到，能够得到这样丰产，主要是劳动人民翻身做了国家的主人，生产劲头不断提高的缘故。
    一九五二年我们要坚决响应您的增产节约号召，做好以下几件工作：一、春季发展互助组二百六十六组，在这个基础上，推动全县的丰产运动；在生产中我们要特别精打细算，节省劳力；二、婚、丧、喜、庆不铺张浪费；三、向曲耀离学习，提高棉花的单位面积产量，并要创造每亩收棉五百斤到五百五十斤的丰产纪录。此外，我们还要努力学习文化，坚决执行婚姻法。我们保证信上写的都能实现，并拿这些条件向李顺达互助组应战。
