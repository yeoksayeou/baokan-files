    Central South Electric Factory Successfully Manufactures 550 Horsepower Eight-Pole Motor
    Comrade Editor: The Central South Electric Factory, under the Industrial Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee, successfully manufactured a 550 horsepower eight-pole enclosed motor on September 28th of last year. This motor can pump two to four tons of water per minute from a water level of 150 to 300 meters deep, and 120 to 240 tons of water per hour. When many workers received the task of manufacturing this motor, they felt it would be difficult to complete given the existing equipment and technical foundation. After encouragement from the factory's Party and administrative leaders, as well as assistance from technical personnel, the workers' confidence was strengthened. During the work process, the technical personnel provided many suggestions for the motor's manufacturing, combining technical theory with practical experience, overcoming many difficulties. For example, the fire-baking of the large base was a major difficulty due to the insufficient size of the factory's furnaces. Technical personnel and workers together came up with a simple and feasible solution: digging a large hole in the mountain, lining it with bricks, and using it as a furnace. The great creativity of the workers in production powerfully educated the technical personnel. When pressing silicon steel sheets, the technical personnel thought that the original tools were not strong enough and a new set had to be made; however, based on past experience, the workers slightly improved the tools and the silicon steel sheets were pressed out. The successful manufacture of this enclosed large motor made the technical personnel deeply realize that it is impossible to achieve anything by relying solely on book knowledge without combining it with practical experience.

    Learn from the Good Example of People's Postal Worker Han Ronghua
    Comrade Editor: Han Ronghua, a first-class postal and telecommunications model worker in the Shanxi District, is a rural postal worker at the Model Post Office in Yu County. With high patriotic enthusiasm and a spirit of hard work and overcoming difficulties, he went deep into all parts of the county to carry out newspaper and magazine distribution work, creating a new record of selling 7,096 copies of various publications in nine months, enabling the entire bureau to complete its annual distribution task one month ahead of schedule.
    Han Ronghua (a Communist Party member) is a second-class disabled veteran with ten years of military service. After retiring, he joined the post office last January. When the bureau's distribution work did not progress during the first quarter of last year, he took the initiative to set out a plan, mobilize the masses, and complete the task. He bought a car and went to various villages to promote sales. Sometimes when he was out and it rained, he would be covered in mud, and he would think: "What is this hardship? Compared to our volunteer soldiers, it's really nothing." Thanks to his leadership, the bureau's distribution business increased month by month. His working methods are: combining publicity with current central tasks and establishing close contact with district and village cadres and the masses. Therefore, his relationship with the masses is very harmonious. His promotion of newspapers and magazines also helped the masses solve difficulties in production. For example, in a mountainous area, an old farmer planted melons every year but they never produced fruit, so he introduced the melon planting experience published in the "Shanxi Farmer" newspaper to the old farmer. The old farmer improved his melon planting methods and achieved a good harvest. Last August, the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea called for donations of books and magazines to the volunteer soldiers. He immediately went to various villages to promote this, mobilizing the villages to challenge each other. For the "Outlook" magazine alone, he collected more than 7,600 copies. It is by no means accidental that he received the glorious title of first-class postal and telecommunications model worker.

    中南电工厂制造五五○匹八极大马达成功
    编辑同志：中南军政委员会工业部所属中南电工厂，在去年九月二十八日，制成五百五十匹八极的封闭式的大马达。这部马达在一百五十公尺到三百公尺深的水位里，每分钟可抽水二吨到四吨，每小时能抽水一百二十吨到二百四十吨。很多工人接到制这种马达的任务时，认为在现有的设备和技术基础上，难以完成。经过厂里党和行政领导方面的鼓励，以及技术人员的协助，工人们的信心就坚定起来了。在工作过程中，技术人员对马达的制造提供了许多的意见，使技术理论和实际经验结合起来，克服了许多困难。比如大机座的火烘问题，因厂内的火炉设备不够大，曾成为一个很大的困难。技术人员和工人一起想出了简便可行的办法：在山上挖一个大洞，用砖砌好，当作火炉，工人在生产上的伟大创造力，有力地教育了技术人员。压矽钢片的时候，技术人员认为用原来的工具，力量不够，必须另做一套；但工人们根据过去的经验，把工具稍加改良，矽钢片就压出来了。这部封闭式的大马达的制造成功，使技术人员深刻体会到光凭书本知识而不结合实际经验是一事无成的。

    学习人民邮递员韩荣华的好榜样
    编辑同志：山西区一等邮电劳动模范韩荣华，是盂县模范邮局的乡村邮递员。他以高度的爱国热忱和吃苦耐劳、克服困难的精神，深入全县各地开展报刊发行工作，创造了一个人在九个月里推销各种刊物七千零九十六份的新纪录，使全局全年发行任务提前一月完成。
    韩荣华（共产党员）是一个有十年军龄的二等甲级残废军人。退休后，他在去年一月参加邮局工作。邮局去年第一季发行工作展不开，他主动订出计划，推动群众，完成任务。他购买了一辆车子，到各村宣传。有时他出外碰到下雨，浑身变成泥人，他就想：“这点苦算什么，和咱们志愿军比起来，实在还不相称。”由于他的带头，全局发行业务逐月上升。他的工作方法是：结合当前中心任务进行宣传鼓动，和区村干部及群众取得密切联系。因此他和群众的关系是非常融洽的。他的推广报刊工作，也帮助群众解决了在生产上的困难。比如某处山地有个老农每年种瓜不结瓜，他就把“山西农民”报登的种瓜经验介绍给老农。这个老农改进了种瓜方法，得到了很好的收成。去年八月，抗美援朝总会号召给志愿军捐献书刊。他立刻到各村宣传，发动各村相互挑战。只“展望”杂志，他就捐得了七千六百多本。他得到一等邮电劳动模范的光荣称号，是决不偶然的。
