To Chairman Mao:

    Happy New Year, 1952! We completed the drainage task of Mine No. 39 in fifteen days, and this is our New Year's gift to you!
    Mine No. 39 was dug by the British imperialists in 1918 and contains about 50 million tons of anthracite coal. However, it was flooded shortly after excavation, and several drainage attempts failed. After the Japanese devils arrived, they wanted to repair it and started the second drainage, which took five years to complete, only to be flooded again. Since then, this mine has been abandoned for seven or eight years.
    In response to your call for increasing production and practicing economy, we are determined to repair this mine. At the beginning, we were not confident, thinking about the failures of the British and Japanese imperialists in drainage. Some people raised many difficulties, such as the lack of equipment, the excessively fast dripping water, and the difficulty of lowering the drainage pump. Thanks to the help of Soviet experts, many difficulties were solved. The Soviet experts told us that as long as we quickly lower the existing five pumps into the well and prevent the existing water volume from exceeding the drainage capacity of the pumps, the water can be drained quickly. Everyone thought the Soviet experts' opinion made a lot of sense. Because the slower the pump is lowered, the less water is drained, and the greater the possibility of the pump being flooded.
    Before the drainage started, Chen Yu, Minister of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, and Liu Xiangsan, Director of the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, personally came here to instruct us and encouraged us, saying: "The anthracite coal produced by Jiaozuo Coal Mine is the best in the country. The water should be drained quickly so that coal can be produced as soon as possible." This made our work enthusiasm even higher. Drainage started on December 6. At that time, everyone unanimously proposed: "Resolutely complete the drainage task as a New Year's gift to Chairman Mao."
    The weather in December was already very cold. After going down the well, our clothes were all soaked, but when we thought of you, we didn't feel cold anymore; we only thought about draining the water quickly and producing coal as soon as possible. Some comrades kept watching the machine day and night, without rest for several nights, and their eyes were bloodshot. During the drainage, everyone encouraged each other: "We are the masters of the country, we are workers of the great Mao Zedong era, and there are no difficulties that we cannot overcome." Therefore, the difficulties were overcome one by one. When the water dripped too fast while lowering the pump, we came up with a way to block it with straw mats and canvas; after the pump was lowered to the bottom of the well, communication between the top and bottom became difficult, and we came up with a way to replace it with red and green lights and electric bells. In this way, after fifteen days of hard work, on December 20, the drainage work was finally completed victoriously, 75 days ahead of our original plan (three months). Now, we are repairing the underground roadways.
    Chairman Mao, under your leadership, we will resolutely overcome conservative thinking, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and strive to build this mine well!
    Respectfully wishing you a healthy New Year!

### 给毛主席的新年献礼  焦作煤矿战胜困难提前完成三十九号矿井排水工程

    给毛主席的新年献礼
    焦作煤矿战胜困难提前完成三十九号矿井排水工程毛主席：
    一九五二年新年到了，我们十五天完成了三十九号矿井的排水任务，这就算给您的新年献礼吧！
    三十九号矿井，是英帝国主义在一九一八年开凿的，里面藏煤量约五千多万吨，全是无烟煤。但开凿不久就被大水淹了，经过几次排水也没成功。日本鬼子到这里后，想修复它，开始第二次排水，排了五年才排完，刚排完又被淹。从此以后这个矿井七八年没人管。
    为了响应您增产节约的号召，我们要坚决修复这个矿井。开始时，我们想到英、日帝国主义排水失败的情形，信心不足。有的人提出很多困难，又是没器材啦，又是淋梆水太急，不好下排水泵等等。由于苏联专家对我们的帮助，许多困难才迎刃而解了。苏联专家告诉我们，只要把现有的五个水泵很快地下到井里，不使现有水量超过水泵的排水能力，水很快即可排完。大家认为苏联专家的意见很有道理。因为泵越下的慢，排的水越少，淹泵的可能性就更大。
    在进行排水前，中央人民政府燃料工业部陈郁部长、中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局刘向三局长亲自到这里指示我们，还鼓励我们说：“焦作煤矿出的无烟煤是全国最好的，应赶快把水排出来，争取早一天出煤。”这一来我们的工作情绪更高了。十二月六日开始排水，当时，大家一致提出：“坚决完成排水任务，作为给毛主席的新年献礼。”
    十二月的天气已经很冷了，下井后，我们的衣服全被湿透，但一想到您，我们就感到不冷了；我们只想着赶快把水排完，早一天出煤。有的同志黑夜白天不断地看着机器，好几夜不休息，两眼都熬的通红。排水时大家互相鼓励着：“我们是国家的主人，我们是伟大毛泽东时代的工人，在我们面前没有克服不了的困难。”因此，困难一个个被我们克服了。如下泵时淋梆太急，我们便想法用席片帆布堵塞；泵下到井底后，上下联系发生了困难，我们又想出了用红绿灯、电铃代替的办法。这样，经过十五天的艰苦工作，十二月二十日，排水工作终于胜利完成了，比我们原来的计划（三个月）提前了七十五天。现在，我们正进行修理井下巷道的工作。
    毛主席，我们要在您的领导下，坚决克服保守思想，学习苏联先进经验，为建设好这个矿井而努力！
    敬祝您新年健康！
  焦作煤矿三十九号矿井排水大队全体职工一九五一年十二月三十日
