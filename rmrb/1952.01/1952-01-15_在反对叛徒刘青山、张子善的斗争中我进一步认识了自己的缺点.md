In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province, the thorough elimination of the bourgeois ideological influence brought to the Party in the Tianjin area by the traitors Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan has been vigorously carried out. One of the main achievements in this movement is the full mobilization of Party members and the masses, truly achieving knowing everything and saying everything, so that all cadres and Party members have further recognized and exposed the crimes of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan in betraying the Party and betraying the people. At the same time, it sharply criticized the harm of bureaucratism and decadent liberalism to the Party and the people. In this movement, all cadres and Party members conducted serious criticism and self-criticism, and improved politically and ideologically. I have also been educated and improved myself in this movement. In this intense and highly principled struggle against the bourgeois ideological influence brought to the Party in the Tianjin area by Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, I further recognized my own shortcomings and the root causes of these shortcomings. I am willing to write it down as a serious lesson in my history.

I believe that my basic shortcomings are manifested in two aspects:

First, the bureaucratic work style. I was working day and night, but I didn't know much about Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, two traitors who wore revolutionary cloaks, stole the wealth of the people, and destroyed the fruits of victory, and I was not vigilant enough. Therefore, they took advantage of the loopholes, and their major crimes were not discovered and exposed for a considerable period of time. I knew about some of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan's evil behaviors, such as disregarding national laws and Party discipline, ignoring the suffering of the people, stealing airport construction funds, disaster relief grain, river construction grain, local grain, and exploiting and deducting wages from migrant workers, colluding with private merchants to illegally operate the production of institutions (actually their theft of state property), and I also expressed objections and fought against them at the time; but most of the facts I did not know (some I learned about afterwards). For example, they took the bad measure of verbally approving and not allowing reports to the Special Commissioner's Office, and illegally allowing various counties to use 2 million catties of local grain to invest in the production of institutions, which was only discovered during this inspection. For another example, Liu Qingshan, Zhang Zishan, and Ma Qingyun (Deputy Secretary of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee) privately stole 103.1 million yuan of public property income from Shengfang and 198 million yuan of public property income from Wen'an for their own private use, and Zhang Zishan stole dozens of taels of gold and silver each from the confiscated property of traitors in Anci County, seriously damaging the system and violating laws and discipline. All these facts were concealed by them for a long time and were not discovered. As the deputy commissioner, I did not understand for a long time, which is difficult to explain to the people and to the higher authorities, and it is a manifestation of irresponsibility for the people's property. It is an act of dereliction of duty and should be criticized or punished.

Second, liberalism. Although I insisted on fighting against the crimes of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan in betraying the Party and the people, today's inspection shows that the fighting spirit was still insufficient, and their evil deeds could not be exposed to the Party and the people earlier, but they were blinded by their shameless rogue methods. Under their patriarchal autocratic rule, most of the members of the Prefectural Committee dared not speak, dared not put it on the table to rely on the organization of the Prefectural Committee to solve the problem, and therefore did not more actively and positively put their evil deeds on the table for struggle. At that time, although it was difficult to do so, but today I think that this difficulty can be overcome through hard struggle. In the struggle with them, I relied solely on the higher authorities. Before the higher authorities dealt with the problems of Liu and Zhang, I repeatedly requested to transfer jobs and leave this area, which actually indirectly fueled their arrogance of corruption and illegality, making them even more daring and able to maintain feudal rule for a long time, increasing the harm to the Party and the people. This is an attitude that a Communist Party member should never take in the struggle to defend the interests of the Party and the people. This is a behavior that benefits the enemy. I feel very distressed when I recall it.

I believe that the reasons for the above shortcomings are: first, my own level of awareness is low, I have not studied enough in ordinary times, and I have a narrow empiricism problem. I cannot systematically analyze and criticize problems, and raise them to such a high level of principle as today to understand. In addition, I have concerns in my mind, worrying about gains and losses, fearing that the problem cannot be completely resolved, and they will pull and suppress me, making me unable to work.

Second, my democratic work style is not enough, and I have not closely integrated with the majority of Party members and cadres, so that the lower levels cannot speak freely in front of me and reflect the situation. In addition, various systems and Party democratic life are not sound, especially among the members of the Prefectural Committee, there is a lack of an atmosphere of exchanging opinions and improving mutual understanding, so that correct opinions cannot be concentrated under the control of their two traitors and turned into a concentrated force, firing at their non-proletarian ideas together.

Therefore, I believe that the lessons learned from the Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan major corruption case proposed by the higher Party committee, and the thorough elimination of the influence of bourgeois corrupt ideas are completely necessary and completely correct. I will definitely accept the lessons of this incident, further exercise myself, improve myself, and do a better job of carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy and the movement to vigorously oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy proposed by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee in the Tianjin area. On the other hand, we must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, arm ourselves, improve our ideological level, improve various systems and Party democratic life, master the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, promote democratic work style, fight resolutely to eliminate all corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and fight to thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois ideological influence brought to the Party in the Tianjin area by Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, and welcome the great economic construction tasks!

### 在反对叛徒刘青山、张子善的斗争中我进一步认识了自己的缺点

    在反对叛徒刘青山、张子善的斗争中我进一步认识了自己的缺点
    河北省天津专署专员　李克才
    河北省天津专区各级机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，在彻底肃清叛徒刘青山、张子善带给天津地区党内的资产阶级思想影响的基础上，大张旗鼓地开展起来了。在这个运动中获得的主要成绩之一，就是充分发动了党员群众，真正作到了知无不言，言无不尽，使所有的干部党员更进一步地认识和揭发了刘青山、张子善背叛党背叛人民的罪行。同时也尖锐地批判了官僚主义和腐朽的自由主义对党对人民的危害。在这一运动中，所有的干部党员都进行了严肃的批评和自我批评，从政治上、思想上提高了一步。我在这个运动中也同样地受到了教育，并提高了自己。在这场反对刘青山、张子善带给天津地区党内的资产阶级思想影响的剧烈的高度原则性的斗争中，使我进一步地认识了自己存在的缺点，以及产生这些缺点的根源。我愿意把它写下来作为我历史上的严重教训。
    我认为我的基本缺点表现在两个方面：
    第一，是官僚主义作风。自己在日日夜夜地工作，对刘青山、张子善两个叛徒穿着革命的外衣，盗走人民的财富，破坏胜利的成果是不大了解的，是警惕不够的。因此，也就使他们钻了空子，使其重大罪行在相当长的时期内未被发现和揭露。对刘青山、张子善不顾国法党纪，不管人民疾苦，盗窃飞机场建筑款、救灾粮、河工粮、地方粮及剥削尅扣民工工资，勾结私商违法经营机关生产（实际是他们盗窃国家财产的勾当）等罪恶行为，有些我是知道的，并且在当时也提出过反对意见，进行了斗争的；但绝大部分的事实是我不知道的（有些是事后知道了的）。如他们采取口头批准不准报告专署的恶劣手段，非法允许各县动用地方粮二百万斤投入机关生产，就是经这次检查才被发现的。又如刘青山、张子善和马庆云（天津地委副书记）私自从胜芳窃取公产收入款一亿零三百一十万元，从文安窃取公产收入款一亿九千八百万元留作私用，以及张子善向安次县窃取没收汉奸财产黄金、白银各数十两的严重破坏制度违反法纪的行为，也曾被他们隐瞒了很久，而未被发现。所有这些事实，作为副专员的我，竟长期不了解，这是对人民对上级难以交代的，是对人民财产不负责任的表现，是一种失职行为，应该受到批评或处分。
    第二，是自由主义。我对刘青山、张子善叛党叛人民的罪行，虽是坚持了斗争，但今天检查起来，斗争的劲头还是不足的，没能更早地使他们的罪恶行为在党和人民的面前暴露出来，反被他们无耻的流氓手段所蒙蔽住了。在他们家长式专制统治下，多数地委委员不敢说话，不敢摆在桌面上依靠地委会这个组织解决问题，因而也就没有更主动更积极地把他们的罪恶行为摆到桌面上进行斗争。在当时，这样作虽然有困难，但我今天看来，这种困难是可以经过艰苦的斗争克服的。在和他们的斗争中，我单纯地依靠了上级，在上级对刘、张的问题未作处理前，我又几次要求调动工作，离开这个地区，这实际上是间接助长了他们贪污违法的气焰，使他们更加胆大妄为，得以长期地维持封建式的统治，增加了对党对人民的危害。这是一个共产党员在为保卫党和人民的利益而进行的斗争中所决不应该采取的态度，这是利于敌人的行为。我回忆起来是十分痛心的。
    产生以上缺点的原因，我认为第一，是我本身觉悟水平低，平素学习不够，存在着狭隘的经验主义的毛病，不能系统地分析批判问题，并提到像今天这样高度的原则上来认识。再加上我思想上存有顾虑，患得患失，恐怕问题不能彻底处理，他们再拉上打下使自己无法工作。
    第二，是我的民主作风不够，和广大党员干部没有亲密地结合起来，使得下级在我面前不能畅所欲言，反映情况。加以各种制度和党内民主生活不健全，尤其在地委委员之间，缺乏交换意见互相提高认识的风气，致使正确意见不能在他们两个叛徒的控制下边集中起来，变成集中的力量，一齐向他们的非无产阶级思想开火。
    因此我认为上级党所提出的接受刘青山、张子善大贪污案的教训，彻底肃清资产阶级腐化思想的影响，是完全必要和完全正确的。我一定接受这一事件的教训，进一步锻炼自己，提高自己，把毛主席、党中央所提出的开展增产节约运动和大张旗鼓地反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，在天津地区搞得更好。另一方面要加强对马列主义和毛泽东思想的学习，武装自己，提高思想水平，健全各种制度和党内民主生活，掌握批评和自我批评的武器，发扬民主作风，为坚决肃清一切贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象而斗争，为彻底肃清刘青山、张子善带给天津地区党内的资产阶级思想影响而斗争，迎接伟大的经济建设任务！
