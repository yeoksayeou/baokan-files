    Salutations to the Heroes of Battle
    —Welcome to the Returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation and the Visiting Korean People's Delegation
    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea
    In the just war against the American imperialist aggression, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean military and civilians displayed an extraordinary spirit of patriotism and self-sacrifice, and achieved glorious and great victories. They safeguarded the independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, safeguarded the security of the national defense of the People's Republic of China, and safeguarded the peace of Asia and the peace of the world. These great achievements will shine for centuries in human history.
    It is this extraordinary spirit of patriotism and self-sacrifice that has inspired all the people of China, enabled all the people of China to receive popular and in-depth patriotic education through the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement, and enabled us to achieve great victories on the land reform front, great victories on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries front, and great victories on all fronts such as economy and culture. Our People's Republic of China has become an indestructible fortress of peace today.
    It is this extraordinary spirit of patriotism and self-sacrifice that has inspired peace-loving people all over the world. The flames of resistance against imperialist aggression and the struggle for national liberation are about to burn all over the world. These flames spread from the Far East to the Middle East, from the Middle East to the Near East, and from the Near East to the entire North Africa on the southern shore of the Mediterranean. All the oppressed nations in the world have gained the conviction of victory in opposing aggression and defending peace, and the strength of the world's peace and democracy camp is growing stronger day by day.
    Although the imperialist aggressive camp is still frantically preparing for war and increasing its arrogance today, its internal contradictions are full of holes and falling apart. The more frantic the war preparations and the more arrogant the arrogance, the more the people's lives are threatened and the lower the morale becomes. The war-mongers are in fact digging their own graves.
    The final victory will inevitably belong to the peace and democracy camp, there is no doubt about it. What we should strive for today is to further strengthen the unity of the peace camp and further strengthen our subjective strength. All of us Chinese people have accepted Chairman Mao's instructions to increase production, practice strict economy, and continue to strengthen the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement; at the same time, we have opened up a new front against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and are waging a firm struggle against the erosion of bourgeois ideology. At this moment, our Volunteer Army representatives have returned, and the Korean people's representatives have also come. What heroic and battle-tested reinforcements we have gained on this new front!
    Dear Volunteer Army representatives! We salute you in battle! You are the most outstanding sons and daughters of our motherland, and you have been transferred from one front to another. Please use your experience in the Korean War to educate our brothers and sisters all over China! How you protect the wealth of the motherland from infringement with your own lives, how you bravely rescue precious equipment and ammunition under the enemy's shells, please use these spirits to arm our brothers and sisters all over China. Just as you heavily attacked American imperialism on the front lines in Korea, let our brothers and sisters all over China resolutely defeat the erosion of bourgeois ideology on the "Three-Anti" front!
    Dear Korean people's representatives! Your arrival in China is a treasure to us, but today we do not want to simply treat you as guests. You are heroic warriors in the peace camp, and like our Volunteer Army representatives, you are our brothers and sisters. Therefore, we also hope that you will participate in our new front against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and help us launch the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Our increase in production and economy is to strengthen the power of the peace camp and strengthen the power of resisting America and aiding Korea. Therefore, Korean brothers and sisters, you have also been transferred from one front to another. Please accept our battle salutations, let us fight side by side on this front as well, and move from one great victory to an even greater victory!
    Glory belongs to those who demonstrate extraordinary patriotism and internationalism!
    Long live the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples—a crystallization of heroes' blood!
    Long live the firm unity and final victory of the world's peace and democracy camp!

    向英雄们致战斗的敬礼
    ——欢迎志愿军归国代表团与朝鲜人民访华代表团
    中国人民抗美援朝总会主席　郭沫若
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜军民在抗击美帝国主义侵略的正义战争中，表现了超度的爱国主义精神和自我牺牲精神，获得了辉煌的伟大的胜利。他们保障了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立，保障了中华人民共和国国防的安全，保障了亚洲的和平和全世界的和平。这丰功伟绩在人类的历史上是要光昭百代的。
    是这超度的爱国主义精神和自我牺牲精神鼓舞了我们全中国人民，使我们全中国人民接受了抗美援朝运动的普及而深入的爱国教育，使我们在土地改革战线上获得了伟大的胜利，在镇压反革命战线上获得了伟大的胜利，在经济文化等一切战线上都获得了伟大的胜利。我们的中华人民共和国在今天已经成为了一座不可摧毁的和平堡垒了。
    是这超度的爱国主义精神和自我牺牲精神鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的人民。反抗帝国主义侵略，争取民族解放运动的烽火快要燃烧遍全世界了。这烽火由远东燃烧到中东，由中东燃烧到近东，由近东燃烧到地中海南岸的整个非洲北部。全世界被压迫民族已经获得了反对侵略，保卫和平的必胜信念，全世界和平民主阵营力量是一天一天地更加壮大起来了。
    尽管帝国主义侵略阵营在今天依然在疯狂备战，增涨嚣张，然而它们的内部是矛盾百出的、分崩离析的。备战愈加疯狂、气焰愈加嚣张，人民生活便愈加受着威胁，士气便愈加低落。战争贩子们事实上是在自掘坟墓而已。
    最后的胜利必然属于和平民主阵营，是毫无疑问的。在今天我们所应当努力的，就是要更进一步地加强和平阵营的团结，更进一步地加强自己的主观力量。我们全中国人民已经接受了毛主席的指示，要增加生产、厉行节约，继续加强抗美援朝的运动；而同时更开辟了一条反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的新战线，对资产阶级思想的侵蚀作坚强的斗争。正在这时候，我们的志愿军代表们回来了，朝鲜人民的代表们也来了，我们在这新战线上是得到两支多么英勇善战的生力军呵！
    亲爱的志愿军代表们！我们向你们致战斗的敬礼！你们是我们祖国的最优秀的儿女，你们是从一条战线又转移到另一条战线来的。请你们以朝鲜作战的经验来教育我们全中国的兄弟姊妹吧！你们是怎样以自己的生命在保卫着祖国的财富不受侵犯，你们是怎样奋不顾身地在敌人的炮弹之下抢救着宝贵的器材和军火，请把这些精神来武装我们全中国的兄弟姊妹吧。就像你们在朝鲜前线沉重地打击了美帝国主义的一样，让我们全中国的兄弟姊妹在“三反”战线上坚决击溃资产阶级思想的侵蚀！
    亲爱的朝鲜人民代表们！你们来到中国是我们宝贵的客人，但我们今天却不想单纯地把你们当成客人看待。你们是和平阵营的英雄战士，和我们的志愿军代表们一样，是我们的兄弟姊妹。因此，我们也希望你们参加我们的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的新战线，帮助我们展开增产节约运动。我们的增产节约是为了加强和平阵营的力量，加强抗美援朝的力量，因此，朝鲜的兄弟姊妹们，你们也是由一条战线又转移到另一条战线来了。请接受我们的战斗的敬礼，让我们在这条战线上也并肩作战，由一个伟大的胜利走向一个更伟大的胜利！
    光荣属于超度的爱国主义精神与国际主义精神的表现者！
    英雄鲜血的结晶——中朝两国人民的兄弟般友谊万岁！
    全世界和平民主阵营的坚强团结和最后胜利万岁！
    一九五二年一月二十一日
