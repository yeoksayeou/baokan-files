    Zhang Ziliang and Yi Jiguang are Two Typical Examples of Progress and Degeneration

    Editor: After reading the "People's Daily" published on January 18th, "Communist Party Member Zhang Ziliang Who Consistently Maintains a Hardworking and Simple Style" and the two articles about Yi Jiguang being expelled from the Party, I feel that this is a stark contrast between progress and degeneration. Comrade Zhang Ziliang has always stood firm and maintained the excellent qualities of a revolutionary cadre. He has always been optimistic and tenacious in moving towards a bright future. He has won the glorious title of "China's Forestry Expert." However, he often uses words such as "the work has not been done well" and "I still need to study hard" to demand of himself. This spirit of conscientious study, conscientiousness, and hard work and simplicity is worthy of our learning. However, Yi Jiguang, due to his unstable stance, could not withstand the temptation of the bourgeoisie, and finally degenerated and ruined his future. We should despise Yi Jiguang, a degenerate element who takes pride in his achievements and befriends the enemy.

    Comrade Zhang Ziliang is walking the bright road; Yi Jiguang is walking the dead end. I think this is something that every revolutionary cadre should firmly remember.

    张子良和易吉光是前进和堕落的两个典型
    编辑同志：我读了一月十八日人民日报发表的“一贯保持艰苦朴素作风的共产党员张子良”和关于易吉光被开除党籍的两篇文章后，觉得这是前进和堕落的鲜明对照。张子良同志始终站稳立场、保持着革命干部的优良品质，他一直是乐观地顽强地朝着光明的远景前进。他获得了“中国的林业专家”的光荣称号。但是，他还常常拿“工作没有做好”“还要好好学习”等话来要求自己。这种认真钻研，认真负责和艰苦朴素的作风，值得我们学习。而易吉光却因为立场不稳，经不起资产阶级的引诱，终于蜕化变质，葬送了自己的前途。对易吉光这种居功自傲，与敌为友的堕落分子，我们应该鄙视他。
    张子良同志走的是光明大道；易吉光走的是绝路。我觉得，这是我们每一个革命干部应该牢牢记取的。
