Ideological Remolding Study Launched for Teachers in Shandong Higher Education Institutions

Under the assistance and leadership of the Shandong Provincial People's Government's Department of Culture and Education, teachers in Shandong Province's higher education institutions began a systematic ideological remolding study movement in late November 1951. To unify the leadership of this movement, the Shandong Provincial Higher Education Institutions Teachers' Study Committee (referred to as the General Study Committee) has been established, with Wang Zhe, Director of the Shandong Provincial People's Government's Department of Culture and Education, serving as Chairman, and Wang Tongzhao and Liu Jianfei, Deputy Directors of the Department of Culture and Education, serving as Vice Chairmen. The study includes 960 teachers and section-chief-level staff from six specialized schools and above, including Shandong Institute of Technology, Shandong Agricultural College, Shandong Medical College, Shandong Normal College, Shandong Accounting School, and the private Qilu University in Jinan. The study is scheduled to end in the summer of 1952.

To promote this study movement and enable teachers to further understand the purpose of this study, the General Study Committee specially invited Xia Zhengnong, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee Shandong Branch, to give an enlightening report on the ideological remolding study of teachers in higher education institutions on November 24th last year. After the report, the leadership of each school (college) absorbed the persons in charge of the school's Party organization, trade union, and Youth League, as well as teacher representatives, to form study sub-committees, and reorganized the teacher study groups. Each group held separate discussion meetings, and many teachers expressed their determination to remold themselves in this study. Many study groups also formulated study covenants.

Based on the study situation in the past month, through listening to reports, studying documents, informal discussions, and group discussions, teachers have a relatively clear understanding of the study. For example, You Jiajun, attending physician of dermatology at Qilu University Medical College, said: "Although I am almost sixty years old, I must study hard, because only by transforming the old ideology and style can I better serve the people." Teachers in various schools have begun to conduct criticism and self-criticism in connection with the work of their schools and their personal thoughts in their studies.

However, judging from the overall situation of the ideological remolding study movement of teachers in Shandong Province's higher education institutions, the development is still uneven. Some teachers still have many concerns about criticism and self-criticism, such as not daring to express opinions to school leaders at all levels. Therefore, leading comrades of various schools must conduct profound self-criticism in connection with the work of their own units and their personal thoughts, and then launch a comprehensive and in-depth criticism and self-criticism among all teachers. This is an important link in promoting the study movement at present. Hua Shan, Vice President of Shandong Agricultural College, exposed the shortcomings in all aspects of the school's work with a spirit of self-criticism. Responsible comrades from other schools (colleges) are also preparing to set an example to promote the ideological remolding study movement of all teachers in order to achieve the goal of remolding ideology and reforming education.

    山东高等学校教师展开思想改造学习
    山东省高等学校教师在山东省人民政府文教厅的帮助和领导下，已在一九五一年十一月下旬开始进行有系统的思想改造学习运动。为了统一领导这一运动，山东省高等学校教师学习委员会（简称总学委会）已成立，由山东省人民政府文教厅厅长王哲任主任委员，文教厅副厅长王统照、刘健飞任副主任委员。参加这次学习的包括山东工学院、山东农学院、山东医学院、山东师范学院、山东会计专科学校及济南市私立齐鲁大学等六个专科以上学校教师和科长以上的工作人员共九百六十人。学习时间预定到一九五二年暑假结束。
    为了推动这一学习运动，使教师们进一步了解这一学习的目的，总学委会在去年十一月二十四日特邀请中共中央山东分局宣传部夏征农副部长作了关于高等学校教师思想改造学习的启发报告。报告后，各校（院）领导方面吸收学校党的组织、工会、青年团负责人和教师代表组成学委分会，重新整理了教师学习小组。各小组均分别举行了座谈会，许多教师都表示决心在这次学习中改造自己。很多学习小组还订立了学习公约。
    根据一个月来的学习情况看，通过听报告、学习文件、漫谈和小组讨论等，教师们对于学习都有了比较明确的认识。如齐鲁大学医学院皮肤科主治医师尤家骏说：“我虽然是快六十岁的人了，但也一定要好好学习，因为只有改造了旧的思想作风，才能更好地为人民服务。”各校教师在学习中已开始联系本校工作及个人的思想展开批评和自我批评。
    但就山东省高等学校教师思想改造学习运动的整个情况看来，发展还是不平衡的，有些教师对于批评和自我批评还存在着不少顾虑，如对于学校各级领导人员，不能大胆地提出意见。因此，各校领导同志必须结合本单位的工作和个人思想进行深刻的自我批评，进而在全体教师中展开全面的、深入的批评和自我批评，这是当前推进学习运动的一个重要环节。山东农学院华山副院长以自我批评的精神对学校工作各方面的缺点进行了揭发，其它各校（院）负责同志也正准备以身作则，来推动全体教师的思想改造学习运动，以达到改造思想和改革教育的目的。
