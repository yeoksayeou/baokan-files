    Shanghai Railway Administration
    Resolutely Relies on the Masses to Besiege Embezzlers
    By Our Correspondent Gu Weijin

    The Shanghai Railway Administration's movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has achieved preliminary results. Many people have confessed their embezzlement, and the broad masses have exposed embezzlers. Petty embezzlers have generally confessed, mid-level embezzlers have mostly confessed, and major embezzlers are gradually becoming isolated. Currently, the broad masses are pressing ahead with redoubled efforts to eliminate mid-level embezzlers and besiege major embezzlers.

    In this movement, the broad masses have been mobilized, and all kinds of people have actively attacked embezzlers. For example, Zhai Jintang, a member of the Communist Youth League from the Shanghai Construction Section, saw that his father, Zhai Wenxian, was unwilling to confess his embezzlement. Disregarding their father-son relationship, he exposed Zhai Wenxian. Zhao Yude, an employee of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Railways' Materials Bureau, had engaged in embezzlement but was unwilling to confess. His wife, Miao Luru, sternly advised him, "If you truly love me and truly love the children, then quickly confess. Otherwise, I will report it to the higher authorities." Zhao Yude quickly confessed. Wang Baoyin's elderly mother from the Maigen Road Station in Shanghai, who is sixty-two years old, is very concerned about the anti-corruption struggle. When her son, Wang Baoyin, returned from a business trip in Tianjin, she specially cooked a chicken for him. She said:
    "Baoyin! Our life has been so good since liberation. In the past, how could we afford to eat chicken? I want to ask you: are you willing to live this way forever?" Wang Baoyin felt that his mother's question was a bit sudden, so he said, "Mom, why are you asking this? Of course, I am willing." The old mother continued, "If you really want to live a good life, then quickly confess your embezzlement to everyone. Otherwise, if you are exposed, you will be prosecuted. If you are prosecuted, how can you still hope to live a good life?" Wang Baoyin was moved by his mother's words and finally confessed. Some embezzlers attempted to escape the masses' attacks by various means. However, they could not escape the dragnet of the masses' anti-corruption struggle. An employee of the Engineering Department named Bao Jinyuan embezzled more than one million yuan and agreed with a merchant that neither of them would expose the other. However, the anti-corruption struggle in the office was very intense, and the radio broadcast anti-corruption matters all day long. He felt uncomfortable in his heart and used the excuse of a business trip to hide outside. When he boarded the train, the radio on the train was also broadcasting anti-corruption matters. He was restless. When he arrived at the Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau, they were also carrying out an anti-corruption struggle. He went to Xinyu County, where they were also conducting an anti-corruption struggle. Later, he arrived at the Pingxiang Railway Sub-bureau, where the anti-corruption struggle had not yet begun. He felt that this place was still quiet and decided to stay here for a few days temporarily. However, in a few days, the anti-corruption struggle also began here. He felt that he had reached a dead end and finally returned to the office to confess his embezzlement. After the mass anti-corruption movement was launched, there was no other way for embezzlers to go except to honestly confess.

    Through the education of this movement, the masses' level of awareness has been greatly improved. Retained personnel have further realized that the policies of the People's Government and the policies of the Kuomintang reactionary government are completely different. They said, "The Kuomintang was rife with corruption, while the People's Government is incorruptible. We can no longer be corrupt in the future." Many cadres from the liberated areas felt that without the education of this movement, they would have been corrupted by the bourgeoisie's corrupt and decadent ideology. A new atmosphere has begun to appear in the Shanghai Railway Administration. Many people have realized that corruption and waste are shameful, while honesty and simplicity are glorious.

    The Shanghai Railway Administration's direct organs' movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy began last December. At that time, the leaders had a clear understanding of the important significance of the Three-Anti movement, and thus were able to implement the policy of leading cadres personally taking action, taking the lead in self-criticism, and resolutely mobilizing the masses.

    When the movement began, the masses had various incorrect understandings of this movement. People who had not embezzled held a liberal attitude toward this movement, thinking that "it doesn't concern me, so I'll just stay out of it." Embezzlers had many concerns, such as fear of returning the embezzled money, fear of going to jail, and fear of losing their jobs. Some embezzlers held "small meetings" and "ran to shops" to try to resist the movement.

    In order to carry out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, first, the main responsible cadres conducted self-criticism within the Party. At the branch meeting, Tan Guangting, secretary of the Party committee and political commissar of the Railway Administration, revealed his bureaucratic work style and extravagant waste behavior without reservation. Then, the director and the director of the Political Department also revealed their problems. This enlightened the responsible cadres and general Party members at all levels, making them realize the important significance of this movement and conduct self-criticism in connection with themselves. At the same time, they also mobilized through organizations such as the trade union and the Communist Youth League; convened various symposiums in various departments of the organization, among employees' families, and in employee children's schools to repeatedly conduct education on anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy; and used various propaganda tools to advise and warn embezzlers to confess.

    After extensive publicity and mobilization from within the Party to outside the Party, from above to below, a tense atmosphere of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy appeared in the organization. The masses initially realized the determination of the leaders to carry out this movement and attached importance to this movement. Embezzlers began to engage in ideological struggle. Some embezzlers eliminated their concerns and confessed. For example, purchasing agent Tu Yaonan confessed to accepting bribes from merchants and embezzling more than twenty million yuan. After confessing, he exposed thirteen embezzlers. Worker Ling Yichang also confessed his embezzlement after intense ideological struggle and his wife's persuasion. People who had previously adopted a liberal attitude toward this movement also actively participated in the movement. For example, the embezzler Xu Qixin was unwilling to confess and ran to his colleague's home to hide. His colleague, knowing about his embezzlement, resolutely persuaded him to go back and confess; at the same time, he also told his mother and wife to mobilize him to confess. In this way, in about ten days, two hundred and fifty-six people confessed. However, most embezzlers did not confess thoroughly. For example, they were willing to talk about small embezzlement but unwilling to talk about large embezzlement; they were willing to talk about embezzlement before liberation but unwilling to talk about embezzlement after liberation. On January 7, the Administration held a "Oppose Corruption, Mobilize Confession" conference. At the conference, the director repeatedly explained the People's Government's policy toward embezzlers. At the same time, on behalf of the leaders of the Railway Administration, he made a profound self-criticism of small public interests used for large public interests, extravagant waste, and bureaucratic work styles, and asked employees to elect representatives to review them. This meeting gave the masses a great education. They began to understand the People's Government's policy toward embezzlers and further understood the leaders' determination to carry out this movement. The masses' emotions were very high. Embezzlers who had not confessed thoroughly before continued to confess; embezzlers who had not confessed began to confess. Some people, after confessing, also actively exposed embezzlers. However, this movement had not yet reached its climax. Some larger embezzlers still refused to confess; some people's embezzlement materials had already been grasped by the leaders, but they were still unwilling to confess. In order to continue mobilizing the masses to attack embezzlers, another "Confession and Exposure" conference was held on January 14. At the meeting, Deputy Director Wu Liangke first announced the reduction or exemption of punishment for one hundred and sixty-six general embezzlers who had consciously confessed and could expose other embezzlers. Then, he called on the masses to openly expose embezzlers who refused to confess. On the spot, Guo Zhesheng, section chief of the Public Security Department, on behalf of the Public Security Department, exposed the embezzler Wu Yaowu, and Huang Yizhi, a clerk at the Travel Service, exposed the embezzler Zeng Maozhao. Both of these people colluded with奸商 and had larger embezzling behavior. In this movement, not only did they not confess, but they also suppressed the masses' exposure in many ways. The masses unanimously demanded the arrest of the two criminals, and the leaders had the two criminals detained through the public security organs. In addition, it was announced at the meeting that five people, including Zhang Xikun, deputy director of the Shanghai Branch of the Transportation Business Office, not only failed to set an example in this Three-Anti movement by reviewing their own problems, but also suppressed democracy and attacked the masses' exposure. It was decided to give them the punishment of suspension or removal from their posts and to set a time limit for confession. This measure more forcefully encouraged the masses' determination to participate in the struggle. After the meeting, the confession and exposure movement continued to develop. The next day, the number of people who confessed increased to seven hundred and eighteen.

    Currently, the Shanghai Railway Administration's anti-corruption movement has entered its climax, and the broad masses are making every effort to besiege major embezzlers.

    上海铁路管理局
    坚决放手发动群众围攻贪污分子
    本报记者　古维进
    上海铁路管理局的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，已经有了初步的成绩。许多人坦白了自己贪污的事实，广大群众检举了贪污分子。小贪污分子已经普遍坦白，中等的贪污分子已经大部分坦白，大贪污分子逐渐陷于孤立。目前广大群众正以再接再厉的精神，肃清中等贪污分子，围攻大贪污分子。
    在这次运动中，广大群众被发动起来了，各种各样的人都积极起来向贪污分子进攻。例如上海建筑段的青年团员翟金棠，看见父亲翟文显不愿坦白贪污事实，他就不顾父子关系，把翟文显检举了。铁道部材料局上海办事处职工赵育德，有贪污行为，不愿坦白，他的妻子缪芦如严正地劝告他说：“你如果真正爱我，真正爱孩子们，那就赶快去坦白；不然我就要去向上级报告。”赵育德就赶快去坦白了。上海麦根路站王保银的老妈妈，今年六十二岁，她非常关心反贪污斗争。当她的儿子王保银从天津出差回来，她就特地烧了一只鸡给他吃，她说：
    “保银！解放后我们的生活真是太好了，要是过去，那能吃得起鸡？我要问问你：你愿不愿意永远过这样的日子？”王保银觉得妈的问话有点突然，他就说：“妈，你问这干吗？那当然愿意。”老妈妈就接着说：“你如果真的愿意过好日子，那就赶快把你贪污的事向大家交代清楚；要不然被人家检举出来，就要法办的。法办了，你还想过得上好日子吗？”王保银被妈妈的话所感动，终于坦白了。有些贪污分子，企图用各种逃避的办法，摆脱群众对他们的进攻。但是，他们逃不出群众反贪污斗争的天罗地网。工务处有个员工叫包金元，贪污一百多万元，和商人说好，谁都不暴露。但是机关的反贪污斗争搞得很紧张，广播整天宣传反贪污的事情。他听了心里不好受，藉口出差到外面躲避。当他上了火车，车上的广播也是宣传反贪污的事情。他坐卧不安。到了南昌铁路分局，那里也正在开展反贪污斗争。他到了新喻县，那里也在进行反贪污斗争。后来，他到了萍乡铁路分局，这里还没有进行反贪污斗争。他觉得这个地方还安静，决定在这里暂时呆上几天。但是没有几天，这里也开展了反贪污斗争。他感到走头无路，最后还是回到机关坦白了贪污的事情。当群众性的反贪污运动开展起来以后，贪污分子除了老老实实地坦白，是没有别的道路可走的。
    群众经过这次运动的教育，觉悟程度大大提高。留用人员进一步认识了人民政府的政策和国民党反动政府的政策是完全不同的。他们说：“国民党贪污成风，人民政府两袖清风。今后不能再贪污了。”从解放区来的许多干部，都感到如果没有这一次运动的教育，就要被资产阶级的腐化堕落思想腐蚀下去。上海铁路管理局开始出现一种新的风气，许多人都认识到了：贪污浪费是可耻的，廉洁朴素是光荣的。

    上海铁路管理局直属机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动是从去年十二月开始的。当时领导方面对于三反运动的重要意义有了明确的认识，因而能够贯彻领导干部亲自动手、带头检讨和放手发动群众的方针。
    当运动开始时，群众对于这个运动有各种不正确的认识。没有贪污的人，对于这个运动抱着“事不关己，高高挂起”的自由主义态度。贪污分子有许多顾虑，如怕退赃、怕坐牢、怕失业等。有些贪污分子“开小会”“跑商店”，设法抵抗这个运动。
    为了开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，首先，由主要负责干部在党内进行自我检讨。在支部会上，党委书记、铁路管理局政委谭光廷，无保留地揭露了自己的官僚主义作风和铺张浪费行为。接着，局长、政治部主任也揭露了自己的问题。这样，就启发了各级党员负责干部和一般党员，使他们认识到这个运动的重要意义，并联系自己，进行检讨。同时，又通过工会、青年团等组织系统，分别进行动员；在本机关各部门及职工家属、职工子弟学校等单位，召开各种座谈会，反复进行反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的教育；利用各种宣传工具，劝告和警告贪污分子坦白。
    经过从党内到党外，从上面到下面，大张旗鼓地进行了宣传动员以后，机关里出现了紧张的反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的空气。群众初步体会到领导方面对于开展这个运动的决心，重视了这个运动。贪污分子开始进行思想斗争。有些贪污分子消除顾虑，进行坦白。如采购员涂耀南，坦白接受商人贿赂，贪污二千多万元。他坦白后，检举了十三个贪污分子。工人凌义昌经过激烈的思想斗争和妻子的劝解，也坦白了贪污的事实。曾经对这个运动采取自由主义态度的人，也积极参加运动了。例如贪污分子徐启新，不愿坦白，跑到他的同事家中躲避。同事知道他的贪污事情，坚决劝他回去坦白；同时还告诉他的母亲和妻子，动员他坦白。这样，大约十天左右，有二百五十六人坦白了。但是，大部分贪污分子坦白不彻底。例如愿说小贪污，不愿说大贪污；愿说解放以前的贪污，不愿说解放以后的贪污。一月七日，管理局召开了“反对贪污、动员坦白”大会。局长在大会上一再说明人民政府对待贪污分子的政策。同时代表铁路管理局领导方面，把小公家套大公家、铺张浪费和官僚主义作风等，作了深刻的检讨，并要求职工推出代表加以审查。这个会议，给了群众很大的教育。他们开始了解人民政府对待贪污分子的政策，同时进一步了解了领导方面对于开展这个运动的决心。群众情绪非常高涨。以前坦白不彻底的贪污分子，继续坦白；没有坦白的贪污分子，开始坦白。有些人在坦白以后，还积极检举贪污分子。但是，这个运动还没有达到高潮。有些较大的贪污分子仍然拒不坦白；甚至有些人的贪污材料已经被领导方面掌握了，还是不愿意坦白。为了继续发动群众，向贪污分子进攻，一月十四日又召开了“坦白检举”大会。会上，吴良珂副局长首先宣布对一批自觉坦白而且能检举其他贪污分子的、一般性的贪污分子一百六十六人，减免处分。接着，号召群众对于拒不坦白的贪污分子实行公开检举。当场就有公安处郭哲生科长代表公安处检举贪污分子吴耀武，旅行服务所事务员黄逸之检举了贪污分子曾懋昭。这两个人都和奸商勾结，有较大的贪污行为，在这次运动中不但不坦白，还多方压制群众的检举。群众一致要求逮捕二犯，领导方面就通过公安机关把二犯扣押起来。另外，会上又宣布运输营业所上海分所副主任张锡堃等五人，在这次三反运动中，不但不能以身作则，检讨本身存在的问题，反而压制民主，打击群众的检举，决定给以停职或撤职的处分，并限期坦白。这个措施，更有力地鼓舞了群众参加斗争的决心。会后，坦白、检举运动继续开展。第二天，坦白的人就增加到七百一十八人。
    目前，上海铁路管理局的反贪污运动已经进入高潮，广大群众正全力向大贪污分子围攻。
