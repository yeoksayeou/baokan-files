Our nation's children are enthusiastically responding to the call of the China Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League by diligently doing one thing during the Spring Festival and winter vacation: helping and comforting the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers.
