The Beginning of a New Fight
Volunteer Army Rehabilitation Member Liao Yixun

I was originally a junior high school student in Beijing. In the late autumn of 1950, I joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. I was wounded on the Korean front and had my right leg amputated at the knee. Because my left foot and both hands were also injured, I returned to my motherland for recuperation that winter. However, as time passed, the situation deteriorated day by day. Finally, on January 27, 1951, my left foot and nine fingers were also amputated, leaving only the thumb on my right hand.

After the surgery, my body was extremely weak, and I didn't even have the strength to speak, but the thoughts in my mind were constantly surging. At first, I felt that everything was over and had pessimistic and disappointed thoughts. Later, I felt very sad: I had only participated in the revolution for a few days, hadn't done anything for the people, and hadn't made greater contributions on the Korean battlefield before becoming disabled. How could I face the motherland? Others saw that I didn't say a word and thought I was worried about my personal future, so they comforted me, saying, "You've become disabled for the revolution, and the people of the motherland will take good care of you. You'll be fine in a nursing home in the future." The mention of a nursing home made me even sadder. "Go to a nursing home?" When will I be "old"? Isn't it shameful to go to a nursing home without working for the Party and the people? I felt sorry for the Party, because the Party had trained me to be a glorious member of the Youth League, and what had I done for the Party? The deepest part of my thoughts was most saddened by this question.

At this time, I realized that it was not terrible for a person to lose both hands and feet. The most serious thing was to lose confidence in life and in the victory of the struggle. I lay in bed and read books like "How the Steel Was Tempered," "The Young Guard," and "A Real Man." The heroic images in these books often appeared before me, encouraging my will to fight and my confidence in victory. Especially Paul Korchagin, who continued to study and write tirelessly in bed even after he was disabled. His infinite loyalty to the Party and the people deeply moved me. I will never forget his words: "Only death can stop my work." I made up my mind to be a person like Paul, and as long as I had a breath left, I would fight to the end for the cause of the Party!

Since I intellectually recognized the meaning of the sentence "Only death can stop my work," I was extremely happy, the sadness disappeared from my face, and songs came out of my throat. From that time on, I often talked and laughed, read newspapers to everyone, and sometimes even forgot that I was a rehabilitation member lying in bed. During this period, the question I was thinking about in my mind was: How can I become a useful person? What methods can I use to work? I repeatedly asked doctors and rehabilitation comrades: "Will my disabled hand be able to write in the future?" Some comrades said, "It can be written after a period of training." Others said, "It's very difficult, I'm afraid it won't work!" At that time, I thought: If I can't write, then I'm finished, because writing is an important condition for me to continue working in the future. Although I knew that there had never been a person in history who relied on only one thumb to wield a pen, I firmly believed that there were no difficulties that could not be overcome under the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore, in April 1951, as soon as my hand, which had undergone amputation surgery, was healed, I began to practice writing. At first, when I used my thumb to hold the pen, I couldn't write a word, and my hand still hurt. Just as I encountered difficulties, Comrade Xie Guanhua in the same ward gave me great encouragement. He was an optimistic, straightforward, and strong-willed partner whose hands had been blown off by shells. After the wounds healed, he tied a pen to his severed forearm and learned to write. Although the small characters he wrote were as big as a palm and not good-looking, he was a person without hands, and I still had a thumb, so I should learn from him even more. Therefore, we naturally became acquainted and often talked about some ideological issues, especially the issue of how to work in the future. He often said: "As long as you have correct thinking and a strong will, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. We must be able to withstand all kinds of tests, because we are all glorious members of the Youth League." In this way, we helped each other in recuperation, worked, and studied, and we both made meritorious contributions in recuperation. However, I will never be complacent. I must persevere and work hard to study.

In the past six months, my disabled right hand has been trained into a flexible and useful hand, and I can write freely. Now, in addition to studying hard in the hospital, I also serve as the rehabilitation platoon leader and the director of the club. After a period of training, I am preparing to accept the more serious tasks given to me by the people. I clearly know that disability does not mean the end of my life, but the beginning of a new fight.

    重新战斗的开始
    志愿军休养员  廖贻训
    我原是北京的一个初中学生，一九五○年秋末参加了中国人民志愿军。我在朝鲜前线负了伤，把右脚齐膝截掉了。但是因为我的左脚与两手也负伤了，所以在那年冬天，我从朝鲜回到了祖国疗养。可是经过一个时期以后，情形一天天恶劣。最后，在一九五一年一月二十七日，又锯掉了左脚和九个手指，只剩下右手的大拇指。
    动手术后，我的身体虚弱到极点，连说话的力气都没有了，但是，脑海中思潮起伏，一刻也不停息。最初，我感到一切都完了，有着悲观失望的思想；后来我感觉非常难过：自己参加革命没几天，没有给人民做什么事情，在朝鲜战场上还没有立下更大功劳，自己就成为残废了。这怎么对得起祖国呢？别人看见我一声不哼，以为我是忧虑个人的前途，于是安慰我说：“为革命残废了，祖国人民是会很好地照顾你的。将来进养老院，一切都没有问题。”一提到养老院我更加难过。“进养老院？”我什么时候才能“老”呢？不为党和人民工作而进养老院，这不使人惭愧死吗？我觉得对不起党，因为党把我培养成为一个光荣的青年团员，我给党做了些什么呢？我思想的深处最感到沉痛的就是这个问题。
    这时，我更发现一个人失去了双手双脚并不可怕，最严重的是失去了对生活、对战斗的胜利信心。我躺在床上看了“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“青年近卫军”、“真正的人”等书，这些书中的英雄形象，经常在我的面前出现，鼓舞起我斗争的意志和胜利信心。特别是保尔·柯察金，他残废了还躺在床上不断地学习，不倦地写作。他对党和人民的无限忠诚，深深地感动了我。我永远忘不了他的话：“只有死亡才能停止我的工作。”我下了决心，要做一个像保尔这样的人，只要我一息尚存，就要永远为党的事业战斗到底！
    自从我在思想上认识到“只有死亡才能停止我的工作”这句话的意义以后，我愉快极了，愁容从我的脸上消失了，歌声从我的喉咙里唱出来。从这时起，我经常有说有笑，给大家读报，有时简直竟忘记了自己是躺在床上的休养员了。在这期间我的头脑里盘算着的问题是：我怎样才能成为一个有用的人？用什么办法来工作？我一再询问医生和休养同志：“我这残废的手将来还能写字吗？”有些同志说：“锻炼一个时期是可以写的。”也有的同志说：“很困难，恐怕不行吧！”当时我想到：如果我不能写字那就完了，因为写字是我今后继续工作的重要条件。我虽然知道历史上还没有一个只靠一个拇指来挥笔杆的人，但是我却坚信在共产党领导下是没有克服不了的困难的。因此，一九五一年四月间我的经过离断手术的手刚好，我就开始练写字了。起初用大拇指挟起笔来，总是写不成字，手还痛。正当我遭遇到困难的时候，同病房的解冠华同志给了我很大的鼓舞。他是一个乐观、爽直、意志坚强的伙伴，双手被炮弹炸掉了。伤口愈合之后，他便把钢笔绑在断了的小臂上学写字。虽然他写的小字竟像手掌一样大，而且不好看，但他是一个没有手的人啊，而我还有一个大拇指，更应该向他学习。因此，我们很自然地熟识起来，时常交谈一些思想问题，特别是谈到今后怎样工作的问题。他时常说：“只要有正确的思想和坚强的意志，就没有克服不了的困难。我们要经得起各种考验，因为我们都是光荣的青年团员。”这样我们在休养中互相帮助工作，学习，而且在休养中都立了功。但是，我绝不自满。我一定要坚持不懈地努力学习。
    半年以来，我的残废的右手已经锻炼成一只灵活有用的手了，我可以自由地写字了。现在，我在医院中除努力学习外，还担任休养排排长和俱乐部主任，在经过一个时期的锻炼后，准备接受人民给我的更严重的任务。我清楚地知道，残废并不等于我生命的结束，而是重新战斗的开始。
