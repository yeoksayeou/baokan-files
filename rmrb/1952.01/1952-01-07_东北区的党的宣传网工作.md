Northeast Bureau Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee

Editor's Note: The experience summarized in this article is very good and worthy of reference by other regions.

Over the past year, Party organizations at all levels in Northeast China have conscientiously implemented the Central Committee's "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the Masses of People Throughout the Party." The construction of the propaganda network in the entire region has achieved great success. At present, the region has 310,395 propagandists, an increase of more than two and a half times compared with the trial period in 1950. Among them, 143,116 are Party members, accounting for 46.2 percent of the total number of propagandists; 60,546 are Communist Youth League members, accounting for 19.5 percent; and 106,733 are non-Party activists, accounting for 34.3 percent. The distribution of propagandists is as follows: 60,829 propagandists in industrial and mining enterprises, accounting for 19.6 percent of the total number of propagandists; 189,441 rural propagandists, accounting for 61.03 percent; 43,578 propagandists in government agencies, accounting for 14 percent; and 16,547 urban street propagandists, accounting for 5.33 percent. According to statistics from Songjiang and Liaoxi provinces, Dalian, Benxi, Fushun cities, and the Northeast Railway system, out of 100,200 people, 14,003 are illiterate, accounting for 14 percent; 33,870 have primary school education, accounting for 34 percent; 27,343 have higher primary school education, accounting for 27.3 percent; 18,428 have junior high school education, accounting for 18.4 percent; 4,464 have senior high school education, accounting for 4.5 percent; and 2,092 have university education, accounting for 2.1 percent.

Regarding the work of report speakers, Party committees, municipal committees, local committees, and enterprise Party committees and general branches in various provinces and cities have been established successively since February and March of 1951. At present, there are 13,063 report speakers in the region. Among them, 774 are provincial and municipal report speakers, 8,963 are county and district report speakers, and 3,326 are enterprise Party committee and general branch report speakers.

Around the propaganda network, tens of thousands of mass propaganda teams are united. They work with propagandists to run blackboards, draw cartoons, organize cultural and recreational activities, organize radio listening, and conduct oral and written propaganda. This is a huge propaganda force. According to incomplete statistics from Shenyang, there are approximately 6,900 mass activists around this propaganda network. In the Shenyang 724 Factory, there are only 120 propagandists, but there are 345 activists around them. In the 14th workshop of this factory, propagandists only account for 3.2 percent of the total number of employees, but the activists united around them account for about 15 percent of the total number of employees. In Taipingshan Village, Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, there are 31 propagandists. There are 25 regular propaganda activists, and more than 70 activists who regularly conduct propaganda work with them in various movements. In Nangang Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, there are 29 propagandists and 74 activists.

Over the past year, in the Party's central tasks at various stages, report speakers, propagandists, and the broad mass propaganda teams have played a significant role in propaganda and organization. They have raised the masses' political consciousness and enthusiasm for production, and strengthened the ties between the Party and the people. For example, in the movements to resist US aggression and aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, increase production and practice economy, and oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, report speakers in various places have generally given reports, and propagandists have also launched extensive propaganda activities. Since March 1951, report speakers have given a total of 83,585 reports to the masses, with a cumulative audience of more than 30.48 million people. Generally, they can give a report to the masses once a month, and some even do so two or three times. Before giving a report, some report speakers contact the units listening to the report, fully collect and study the audience's thoughts and current work situation, and then carefully prepare the report materials to ensure that the content is practical, specific, and vivid, truly solving the masses' ideological problems and powerfully promoting production and work.

The propagandists and the broad mass propaganda activists scattered in various work posts, in every movement, use various forms of propaganda, such as reporting victories, reporting good news, small-scale reports, seminars, quick reports, blackboards, cartoons, charts, reading newspapers, broadcasting, clapper talk, drum songs, "native movies" (slides), shadow puppets, and various exhibitions, quality improvement palaces, honor rolls, honor banners, "red flag inspections, blue flag supervision," etc., to carry out extensive propaganda anytime and anywhere, which has a great effect.

In implementing the Central Committee's decision on the system of leading the propaganda network, Party committees at all levels have been relatively conscientious. Over the past year, we have established a series of relatively complete leadership systems. This system has laid a good foundation for the regularization of propaganda network work.

First, regarding the meeting system. In 1951, the Northeast Bureau convened a regional representative meeting of propagandists, and in 1952, it plans to convene representative meetings of propagandists from industrial and mining enterprises and rural areas in January and July, respectively. Party committees and general branches of provinces, cities, and enterprises, and rural district committees, convened a total of 17,160 joint meetings of branch secretaries and 11,460 representative meetings of propagandists in 1951. Branch propagandist meetings are generally held once a month or every half month, with a total of 46,138 meetings held. Through the above-mentioned various meetings, Party committees at all levels report on the current situation and tasks, understand the ideological situation of the masses, arrange propaganda work, and disseminate advanced experiences.

Second, the instruction system. In industrial and mining enterprises and urban streets, due to the concentration of work content and convenient transportation, centralized instruction meetings, such as report meetings and lectures, are generally adopted. In rural areas, due to scattered residences, inconvenient transportation, the low cultural level of propagandists, and the lack of strong leadership from branches, the form of instruction stations is mainly adopted. The region has now established 4,683 instruction stations, with a total of 27,470 instructions given, and a cumulative total of 1,746,319 propagandists listening to the instructions. Some instruction stations are implemented by district-level report speakers on a contract basis, generally conducting instructions once every half month. The content of the instructions is concise and can be combined with reality, so the effect of the instructions is greater. According to the experience of various places in running instruction stations, to run instruction stations well, the district committee must attach importance to it, the district report speakers must implement a contract system, and regular inspections must be carried out according to the system. Select villages with a good work foundation and a central location as instruction stations. When giving instructions, it is necessary to maintain the participation of certain key personnel (such as branch secretaries and propaganda committee members) to facilitate communication back to the village, while also taking into account that all propagandists in the village can participate in rotation to universally improve the level of propagandists. The content of the instructions should be simple, specific, and combined with reality, and only one or two issues should be discussed each time. The instruction method should be a combination of explanation and discussion, paying attention to using local examples for education, and avoiding completely rigid indoctrination methods.

Third, the contract system, that is, the responsibility system in propaganda work. This system has been promoted in most areas, and some areas are in the process of promoting it. This contract system includes dividing the contract areas according to the level of the report speaker, the conditions of the audience, and the work business; and specifying the propaganda scope, objects, or responsible for a certain propaganda tool according to the political, cultural, work duties, capabilities, and specialties of the propagandist. The implementation of this contract system has greatly improved the sense of responsibility of report speakers and propagandists, strengthened the connection with the masses, improved the enthusiasm of report speakers and propagandists in studying their business, and also greatly strengthened the organization and regularity of propaganda work. In many areas where the contract system has been implemented, it has been achieved that "everyone knows and every household understands."

Fourth, the card system. This is an effective method to promote the work of report speakers, and it has been adopted in most areas. The Party Committee of Benxi Machinery Factory has created good experience in implementing the card system. Their method of using cards is: the Party committee fills in the report time, place, and report title (after discussion by the report speaker group and with the consent of the report speaker), and gives it to the report speaker two days before the report. The report speaker takes the card to the designated contract location, and when reporting, the card is handed over to the local branch, which is responsible for collecting mass reactions and branch opinions, filling them in and returning them to the Party committee. The Party committee copies it and gives it to the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, and the original card is divided into volumes according to each report speaker (called the report speaker's work manual), given to each report speaker for review, and stored in the Party committee as the basis for evaluating performance. This card becomes an important tool for urging report speakers, contacting branches, going deep into the masses, and understanding the situation. Because they conscientiously implement this card system, they have greatly improved the work of the report speakers and improved their enthusiasm for work.

Fifth, the inspection system. That is, the branch secretary and branch committee members regularly inspect the activities of the propagandists, and after the propagandist's reporting meeting, brainstorming meeting, especially going deep into the masses from the bottom up to check the propaganda effect, and promptly help the propagandists solve difficulties. The establishment of this system has a greater role in promoting the work of propagandists.

Sixth, the study system for propagandists. In addition to studying in the propagandist conference and instruction stations, the branch often organizes them to study "Current Affairs Handbook" and "Propagandist Handbook," and absorbs non-Party propagandists to participate in Party class study, which plays an important role in improving the political level and work ability of propagandists.

Seventh, running propagandist training courses. Over the past year, the entire region (excluding Rehe Province materials) has run a total of 1,164 training courses, and the number of trainees is 63,369, accounting for 22.3 percent of the total number of propagandists. Running training courses is one of the important ways to improve propagandists. According to Fushun's survey, 90 percent of the trained propagandists in Longfeng Mine can play a role and actively carry out propaganda. Most of the propagandists who did not know how to do propaganda work or were unwilling to do propaganda work in the past have changed their emotions. The methods of running training courses in various places are: some have a short-term school for propagandists attached to the Municipal Party School (such as Anshan); some are short-term training courses of one to two weeks run by the municipal and county Party committees; some are short-term training courses of five to seven days run by the district committees with the help of the county Party committees in the districts; and some are trained by the district committees in depth into the branches, combined with the central task, and using spare time.

Eighth, regularly supplying propaganda materials. At present, the main readings for propagandists are "Current Affairs Handbook," "Propagandist Handbook," various newspapers, and propaganda materials compiled by provinces and cities. "Propagandist Handbook" has been published in 42 issues, with a total circulation of 9 million copies, and currently sells 300,000 copies per issue. This publication is generally welcomed by propagandists. Its advantages are: it can grasp the central tasks of each period, combine with reality, the text is generally still popular, and it plays a greater role in promoting the current various movements.

At present, there are still many problems in the construction of the Party's propaganda network in the Northeast region. These problems are:

First, the role of propagandists has not been fully发挥起来. According to the situation in various places, the role of propagandists can be roughly divided into three types: The first type can often发挥作用. These propagandists have awareness, political responsibility, and certain propaganda abilities and experience. The second type cannot often发挥作用. These propagandists are also very willing to宣传, and all the propaganda tasks arranged by the Party Committee have been completed, but because the Party Committee and the branch lack leadership, the necessary system has not been established, or the established system has not been adhered to. Therefore, it is formed once it is arranged,宣传once, no arrangement, no宣传. The third type rarely发挥作用 or does not发挥作用 at all. These propagandists, on the one hand, because the Party committee responsible departments relax leadership and do not hold meetings for a long time; on the other hand, they are also not cautious enough when establishing the propaganda network, and some people who are not qualified are also pulled into the propaganda network. For example, some are of good quality, but their propaganda ability is too weak; some have completely lost their prestige among the masses because of their poor quality; and a few even have unclear political faces and cannot be propagandists at all. The proportion of these three types, as far as the whole region (excluding Rehe Province) is concerned, the first type of propagandists has 104,903, accounting for 37 percent; the second type of propagandists has 124,584, accounting for 44 percent; and the third type of propagandists has 54,166, accounting for 19 percent. This situation proves that there is still great potential in propagandists. In the past, we did not do enough training work for propagandists, and some places still have the view of "only use, not cultivate." Therefore, if we can seriously improve the work of propagandists and tap potential, the propaganda force will be greatly enhanced.

Second, in the development of propagandist organizations, there is still an imbalance. Some areas have developed quite universally. For example, in Heilongjiang, among the 5,487 branches in the province, 5,373 branches have established a propaganda network, accounting for 98 percent of the total number of branches. However, in the whole region (excluding Rehe Province), only 82 percent of the branches have established a propaganda network, and 18 percent of the branches have not established one. At present, whether in industrial and mining enterprises or rural areas, there are still some blank branches, especially in areas that were liberated later, there is still a considerable number of "blank" branches (some counties account for about 50 percent). In the branches that have established a propaganda network, some branches do not have enough propagandists, and do not pay attention to regularly cultivating activists and regularly developing the work of propagandists. Therefore, it is in a static state. In rural areas without Party branches, except for Heilongjiang, where more than 200 villages have established propagandists who are not Party members, non-Party member propaganda networks are generally rarely established.

Third, the number of instruction stations is insufficient, and the established instruction stations have not fully发挥作用, and there is some formalism. As far as the whole region is concerned, more than 4,600 instruction stations is too small. In Heilongjiang, there is an instruction station on average every three and a half villages, but in some areas, there are very few instruction stations. In the existing instruction stations, some do not have a fixed system, and only conduct instructions when arranging work tasks. Village cadres and propagandists all come, there are many work tasks arranged, and there are few propaganda tasks assigned, making the instruction station become a "base for arranging work." This kind of instruction station does not发挥作用 much. In addition, some instruction stations do not have a fixed instruction location at all, nor do they have dedicated personnel in charge, and the instructions are very infrequent, and the name does not match the reality.

Fourth, in the work of report speakers, the main shortcomings are lack of leadership and system. Some Party committee responsible departments do not regularly convene report speaker meetings, do not have a report work plan for each period, do not stipulate the necessary system (such as the contract system, card system), and do not supervise and inspect the report speakers who do not report to the masses. This self-flow and laissez-faire phenomenon of report speaker work makes it difficult to regularize the work of report speakers.

According to the above situation, in the future, in order to make propaganda work more closely serve the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and increase production and practice economy, Party committees at all levels must continue to implement the spirit of the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network, and improve and develop the propaganda network.

First, in terms of consolidating and improving: A. It is necessary to combine with the Party rectification work to consolidate and improve the first type of propagandists and the second type of propagandists, and rectify the third type of propagandists. It is required that 60 percent of the existing propagandists receive training in the Party rectification and various tasks in the winter of 1951 and 1952. Cultivating and training propagandists is one of the important steps to consolidate and improve the propaganda network, and all localities should attach great importance to this work. B. It is necessary to introduce and promote some more mature experiences. In industrial and mining enterprises, we should continue to promote the advanced experience of the 724 Factory and other factories and mines. In particular, we should universally publicize the propaganda experience of the 14th workshop of the 724 Factory in the workshop branch. In rural areas, we should universally promote the experience of the propaganda network in Taipingshan Village, Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, and Nangang Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province. Among the report speakers, we should universally promote the methods and experience of the Party Committee of Benxi Machinery Factory in leading the work of report speakers. C. In rural areas, we should universally establish the work of instruction stations in 1952. It is required to establish an instruction station every three or four villages, and the district committee should seriously and responsibly run one or two good instruction stations to gain experience and universally improve the work of the instruction stations. D. We should continue to promote the contract system among propagandists and report speakers, and conscientiously implement the card system among report speakers.

Second, in terms of development: A. In areas that were liberated later, we should combine the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries and re-elect village power organs to carefully and universally establish a propaganda network. B. In areas where the propaganda network has been established quite universally, we should fill in the "blank" branches, and the branches with too few propagandists should develop a group of activists as propagandists. C. We must cultivate a large number of activists and organize a large propaganda team, and in rural areas and urban streets where there are no Party branches, we should actively establish the work of non-Party member propaganda networks.

Third, in order to achieve the above requirements, Party committees in all localities should attach great importance to the leadership of the propaganda network work, and propaganda departments at all levels should formulate specific plans for improving and developing the propaganda network and improving the work of report speakers according to the specific conditions of their localities, and regularly check them.

    东北区的党的宣传网工作
    中共中央东北局宣传部
    编者按：本文所总结的经验是很好的，值得其他地区参考。
    一年来东北各级党的组织，认真执行了中央“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”。全区的宣传网建设工作，已获得了很大的成绩。目前全区拥有宣传员三十一万零三百九十五人，较一九五○年试办时期发展了二倍半以上。其中党员十四万三千一百一十六人，占宣传员总数的百分之四十六点二；青年团员六万零五百四十六人，占百分之十九点五；非党积极分子十万零六千七百三十三人，占百分之三十四点三。宣传员的分布状况是：工矿企业宣传员六万零八百二十九人，占宣传员总数的百分之十九点六；农村宣传员十八万九千四百四十
    一人，占百分之六十一点零三；机关宣传员四万三千五百七十八人，占百分之十四；城市街道宣传员一万六千五百四十七人，占百分之五点三三。据松江、辽西两省，旅大、本溪、抚顺三市和东北铁路系统十万零二百人的统计，文盲为一万四千零三人，占总数的百分之十四；初小三万三千八百七十人，占百分之三十四；高小二万七千三百四十三人，占百分之二十七点三；初中一万八千四百二十八人，占百分之十八点四；高中四千四百六十四人，占百分之四点五；大学二千零九十二人，占百分之二点一。
    关于报告员工作，各省、市、地方党委及工矿企业党委总支委，自一九五一年二、三月起，已陆续建立起来。目前全区有报告员一万三千零六十三人。其中省、市报告员七百七十四人，县区报告员八千九百六十三人，企业党委总支委报告员三千三百二十六人。
    在宣传网的周围，团结着成千成万的群众宣传队伍。他们和宣传员在一起，办黑板报，画漫画，组织文化娱乐活动，组织收听广播，进行口头和文字宣传。这是一支巨大的宣传力量。据沈阳的不完全统计，这种宣传网周围的群众积极分子约有六千九百多人。沈阳七二四工厂，宣传员只有一百二十人，而他们周围的积极分子就有三百四十五人。这个厂的第十四车间，宣传员只占全体职工的百分之三点二，但团结在他们周围的积极分子，就占全体职工的百分之十五左右。黑龙江省肇东县太平山村，宣传员有三十一人。定型的宣传员积极分子有二十五人，在各种运动中经常和他们在一起进行宣传工作的积极分子还有七十多人。吉林蛟河县南岗村，宣传员是二十九人，积极分子就有七十四人。
    一年来，在各个时期党的中心任务中，报告员、宣传员和广大的群众宣传队伍，起了重大的宣传作用和组织作用。提高了群众政治觉悟和生产积极性，密切了党和人民群众的联系。如在抗美援朝、镇压反革命、增产节约和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，各地报告员普遍作了报告，宣传员也展开了广泛的宣传活动。自一九五一年三月以来，报告员共向群众作了八万三千五百八十五次报告，听众累计达三千零四十八万多人。一般都能每月向群众作一次报告，多的则达二、三次。有些报告员在作报告以前，就和听报告的单位联系，充分收集和研究听众思想和当前工作状况，然后认真准备报告材料，作到内容切合实际，具体生动，真正解决了群众思想问题，有力地推动了生产和工作。
    散布在各种工作岗位的宣传员和广大的群众宣传积极分子，他们在每一运动中，运用各种宣传形式，如报捷、报喜、小型报告、座谈、快报、黑板报、漫画、图表、读报、广播、快板、大鼓，土电影（幻灯）、皮影、以及各种展览会、质量改进宫、光荣榜、光荣标、“红旗检查、蓝旗督促”等，随时随地进行广泛宣传，其作用很大。
    在执行中央决定中关于领导宣传网的制度上，各级党委是比较认真的。一年来我们已建立了一系列比较完整的领导制度。这种制度给宣传网工作的经常化，奠定了较好的基础。
    第一，关于会议制度。一九五一年东北局召开了一次全区宣传员代表会，一九五二年打算在一月和七月分别召开工矿企业和农村宣传员代表会议。各省、市委、企业总支和农村区委，一九五一年共召开支部书记联席会议一万七千一百六十次，宣传员代表大会一万一千四百六十次。支部宣传员大会，一般都能每月或半月召开一次，共召开了四万六千一百三十八次。各级党委通过上述各种会议，报告当前形势和任务，了解群众思想情况，布置宣传工作，传播先进经验等。
    第二、传授制度。在工矿企业和城市街道，因工作内容集中、交通方便，一般都采取集中的传授大会，如报告会、讲座等。在农村，因居住分散，交通不便，宣传员文化水平低及支部领导不够坚强等情况，主要是采用传授站的形式。全区现已建立四千六百八十三个传授站，共传授二万七千四百七十次，听取传授的宣传员累计达一百七十四万六千三百一十九人。有些传授站是由区级报告员实行包干制，大体半月进行一次传授，传授内容扼要并能结合实际，因而传授的效果较大。根据各地办传授站的经验，要办好传授站，必须区委重视，区报告员
    实行包干制，经常按制度进行检查。选择工作基础好、地点适中的村为传授站。传授时要保持一定的骨干参加（如支部书记、宣传委员），以便回村传达，同时又要照顾全村宣传员都能轮流参加，以便普遍提高宣传员的水平。传授内容要简明具体，结合实际，每次只讲一两个问题。传授方法，应是讲解结合启发讨论，注意利用当地的实例进行教育，避免完全死板的注入教法。
    第三，包干制，即宣传工作中的责任制。目前大部地区已推广了这种制度，有些地区正在推行中。这种包干制，包括按报告员的水平、听众条件、工作业务，具体划分包干区；按宣传员的政治、文化、工作职务和能力、特长，具体规定宣传范围、对象或负责某一种宣传工具。这种包干制的实行，大大提高了报告员和宣传员的责任感，加强了和群众的联系，提高了报告员、宣传员钻研业务的积极性，同时也大大加强了宣传工作的组织性和经常性。有许多实行包干制的地区，已做到“人人皆知，家喻户晓”。
    第四，卡片制度。这是推动报告员工作的有效方法，目前大部地区已采用。本溪机械厂党委在实行卡片制中，创造了很好的经验。他们使用卡片的方法是：由党委把报告时间、地点、报告题目填好（事先经过报告员小组会讨论，取得报告员同意），在报告前两天交报告员本人，报告员拿着卡片到指定的包干地点，报告时把卡片交当地支部，由支部负责搜集群众反应和支部意见填好交回党委，由党委另抄一份交市委宣传部，原卡片按每个报告员分订成册（名叫报告员工作手册），交各报告员阅后存于党委，作为考核成绩的根据。这种卡片就成为督促报告员、联系支部、深入群众、了解情况的重要工具。他们由于认真实行这种卡片制度，已大大改进了报告员的工作，提高了报告员的工作积极性。
    第五，检查制度。就是由支部书记和支部委员，经常分工检查宣传员的活动，经过宣传员汇报会、碰头会，特别是深入群众自下而上的检查宣传效果，并及时帮助宣传员解决困难问题。这种制度的建立，对宣传员工作的推动作用较大。
    第六，宣传员的学习制度。宣传员除在宣传员大会和传授站中进行学习外，支部经常组织他们学习“时事手册”，“宣传员手册”，并吸收非党宣传员参加党课学习，这对提高宣传员的政治水平和工作能力起了重要作用。
    第七，开办宣传员训练班。一年来全区（缺热河省材料）共办训练班一千一百六十四期，受训的人数是六万三千三百六十九人，占宣传员总数的百分之二十二点三。办训练班是提高宣传员的重要办法之一。据抚顺调查，龙凤矿受训的宣传员有百分之九十能起作用并主动进行宣传，过去大部分不知怎样做宣传工作或不愿作宣传工作的宣传员，都在情绪上为之一变。各地办训练班的方法，有的是在市委党校附设宣传员短期学校（如鞍山）；有的是由市、县委办一周至两周的短期训练班；有的是由区委负责、县委帮助在区上办五天到七天的短期训练班；有的是由区委负责、深入支部，结合中心任务，利用业余时间，进行训练。
    第八，经常供给宣传材料。目前宣传员的主要读物是“时事手册”、“宣传员手册”、各种报纸及省市编写的宣传材料。“宣传员手册”，已出版四十二期，总发行量为九百万册，目前每期销三十万份。这个刊物一般受到宣传员的欢迎。它的优点是：能抓住每一时期的中心任务，结合实际，文字一般还通俗，对当前各项运动的推动作用较大。
    目前东北区的党的宣传网的建设工作中，仍然存在着许多问题。这些问题就是：
    第一，宣传员的作用还没有充分发挥起来。根据各地情况，宣传员的作用大体可分三种类型：第一类，能经常起作用。这类宣传员有觉悟，有政治责任心，有一定宣传能力和经验。第二类，不能经常起作用。这类宣传员也很愿意宣传，并且凡是党委布置的宣传任务也都作了，但因为党委和支部缺乏领导，没有建立必要的制度或建立了未能坚持，因此形成布置一次，宣传一次，没有布置，就没有宣传。第三类，很少起作用或根本不起作用。这类宣传员，一方面由于党委负责部门放松领导，长时间不开会；另方面也由于在建立宣传网时不够慎重，把有些不够条件的人也拉到宣传网里来。如有的品质虽好，但宣传能力太弱；有的则因为品质不好，在群众中完全丧失威信；个别的甚至政治面目不清，根本不能做宣传员。这三种类型的比重，就全区（热河省未计）来看，第一类宣传员有十万零四千九百零三人，占百分之三十七；第二类宣传员十二万四千五百八十四人，占百分之四十四；第三类宣传员五万四千一百六十六人，占百分之十九。这种情况证明，在宣传员中还有极大的潜在力量。过去我们对宣传员的训练工作是做得不够的，有些地方还存在“只使用，不培养”的观点。因此如果我们能认真提高宣传员的工作，发掘潜力，宣传力量就会大大增强。
    第二，在宣传员组织的发展上，目前仍存在着不平衡的现象。有些地区发展得相当普遍。如黑龙江在全省五千四百八十七个支部中，已有五千三百七十三个支部建立了宣传网，占支部总数的百分之九十八弱。但在全区（缺热河省材料）只有百分之八十二的支部已建立了宣传网，还有百分之十八的支部没有建立。目前不论在工矿企业或农村，都还存在一些空白支部，特别在解放较晚的地区还有相当数量的“空白”支部（有些县约占百分之五十左右）。在已建立宣传网的支部中，有的支部宣传员数量还不够，不注意经常培养积极分子和经常发展宣传员的工作。因此处于静止的状态。没有党支部的农村，除黑龙江已有二百多个村建立了非党员的宣传员外，一般都很少建立非党员宣传网。
    第三，传授站的数量不够，已建立的传授站还没有完全发挥作用，存在着某些形式主义。就全区来说，四千六百多个传授站是太少的。在黑龙江平均三个半村有一个传授站，但在有些地区传授站还很少。在已有的传授站中，有的是没有固定制度，只在布置工作任务时进行传授，村干部、宣传员都来，布置工作任务多，交代宣传工作少，使传授站变成
    “布置工作的据点”，这种传授站作用不大。另外有些传授站则根本没有固定的传授地点，也没有专人负责，传授很不经常，有名无实。
    第四，在报告员工作上，主要缺点是缺乏领导和制度。有的党委负责部门不经常召开报告员会议，没有各时期的报告工作计划，没有规定必要制度
    （如包干制、卡片制），对不向人民群众作报告的报告员也没有督促检查。报告员工作的这种自流放任现象，就使报告员工作难于经常化。
    根据上述情况，今后为使宣传工作更紧密地为抗美援朝、增产节约运动服务，要求各级党委必须继续贯彻中央关于建立宣传网决定的精神，把宣传网提高一步，发展一步。
    第一，在巩固和提高方面：甲、必须结合整党工作，巩固和提高第一类宣传员和第二类宣传员，整顿第三类宣传员。要求在一九五一年冬和一九五二年的整党以及各项工作中，使现有宣传员的百分之六十受到训练。培养和训练宣传员是巩固提高宣传网的重要步骤之一，各地应十分重视这一工作。乙、必须介绍和推广某些比较成熟的经验。在工矿企业中应继续推广七二四厂及其他厂矿的先进经验。特别在车间支部中应普遍宣传七二四厂十四车间的宣传经验。在农村中应普遍推行黑龙江肇东县太平山村及吉林省蛟河县南岗村宣传网的经验。在报告员中应普遍推行本溪机械厂党委领导报告员工作的办法和经验。丙、在农村中，一九五二年应普遍建立传授站的工作。要求三、四个村建立一个传授站，并由区委认真负责地办好一两个好的传授站，以获得经验，普遍提高传授站的工作。丁、在宣传员、报告员中应继续推行包干制，在报告员中认真实行卡片制度。
    第二，在发展方面：甲、在解放较晚的地区，应结合镇压反革命、改选村政权运动，慎重地把宣传网普遍建立起来。乙、在宣传网已相当普遍建立的地区，应填平“空白”支部，宣传员数量太少的支部，应发展一批积极分子为宣传员。丙、要大量培养积极分子，组织千军万马的宣传队伍，在还没有党的支部的农村和城市街道中，应积极建立非党员宣传网的工作。
    第三，为实现上述要求，各地党委应十分重视对宣传网工作的领导，各级宣传部应根据本地具体情况，拟出提高和发展宣传网及改进报告员工作的具体计划，并经常加以检查。
