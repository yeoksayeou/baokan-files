Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 30th - At the meeting on the 30th regarding the third agenda item of the Korean Armistice Negotiations, the Staff Meeting of Both Sides, the general principles of the concrete arrangements for ceasefire and armistice in the draft armistice agreement were discussed in detail. Regarding the issue of rotating military personnel on both sides during the ceasefire, our side had proposed a limit of 5,000 people per month in the subcommittee. However, in order to quickly reach a ceasefire agreement and to satisfy the preliminary wishes of peace-loving people around the world, our side proposed in the staff meeting that the maximum number of military personnel entering Korea for rotation during the ceasefire should not exceed 25,000 people per month for either side. However, the other side suggested a huge number of 75,000 people per month. Our staff pointed out that the huge number proposed by the other side completely exceeded the scope of reasonable military personnel rotation. The maximum limit of 25,000 people per month proposed by our side does not restrict the number of military personnel from both sides withdrawing from Korea, and it can completely meet the legitimate rotation needs of both sides.

    At the subcommittee of the fourth agenda item, in order to prevent the subcommittee from continuing to spend more time on detailed issues, our representative today once again commented on each item of the draft principles proposed by the other side on the 28th, and pointed out that the main clauses in its proposal were firmly opposed by our side, because these clauses opposed the principle of unconditional release and repatriation of prisoners of war, and advocated "voluntary repatriation," which not only deprived prisoners of war of their basic rights, but also exceeded the scope of military negotiations; because these clauses opposed the principle of both sides releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war, and advocated the principle of one-for-one exchange, attempting to blackmail by the fact that the other side controlled a larger number of prisoners of war; because these clauses confused civilians with prisoners of war, substituting civilians for prisoners of war, and using prisoners of war as hostages; because these clauses advocated unilateral oaths and violated all war regulations, illegally classifying our captured personnel as civilians. Our representative also solemnly told the other side that if the other side does not abandon its unreasonable demands and stubborn attitude on these issues, and only circles around in words, such as changing "one-to-one" to "exchange of equal numbers," it will not help the resolution of the fourth agenda item in any way.

    关于停战期间双方军事人员的轮换问题
    美方竟在参谋会上提出不合理的庞大数字
    我方郑重指出美方应在俘虏问题上放弃其无理主张
    【新华社开城三十日电】朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程双方参谋会议，在三十日的会上详细地讨论了停战协定草案中有关停火与休战的具体安排的总则部分。关于停战期间双方军事人员的轮换问题，我方在小组委员会曾经提出过每月五千人的限额，但为了迅速达成停战协议，以满足全世界爱好和平的人民的初步愿望，我方在参谋会议中提出任何一方在停战期间进入朝鲜进行轮换的军事人员不得超过每月二万五千人的最高限额。但对方却建议每月七万五千人的庞大的数字。我方参谋人员指出对方所提出的庞大数字，完全超出了合理的军事人员的轮换的范围。我方所提出的每月二万五千人的最高限额，毫不限制撤离朝鲜的双方军事人员的数目，对于双方的正当的轮换的需要是完全可以满足的。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表为使小组委员会不再继续在细则问题上占去更多的时间，今日再次就对方二十八日所提的原则草案，进行了逐项的评论，并指出其提案中的主要条款为我方所坚决反对，因为这些条款反对无条件释放并遣返战俘的原则，而主张“志愿遣送”，不仅剥夺了战俘的基本权利，而且超出了军事谈判的范围；因为这些条款反对双方释放并遣返所有战俘的原则，而主张一比一交换的原则，企图以对方手中控有的战俘数目较多而进行敲诈；因为这些条款把平民与战俘混为一谈，以平民顶替战俘，以战俘当人质；因为这些条款主张片面的宣誓以及违反一切战争法规，将我方被俘人员非法分类为平民。我方代表并郑重告诉对方，对方如不在这些问题上放弃其无理主张和固执态度，而只是在文字上兜圈子，例如将“一对一”改为“同等数目的交换”之类，无论如何是无助于第四项议程的解决的。
