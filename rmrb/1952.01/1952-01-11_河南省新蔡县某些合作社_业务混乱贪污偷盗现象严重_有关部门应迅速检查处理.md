    In Certain Cooperatives of Xincai County, Henan Province,
    Business is Chaotic and Embezzlement and Theft are Rampant;
    Relevant Departments Should Promptly Investigate and Deal With It

    Editor: In certain grassroots cooperatives of Xincai County, Henan Province, the foundations are not firmly established, the cadres are impure, resulting in a serious phenomenon of detachment from the masses, causing significant losses to public property. In Chenzhai Cooperative of the Fifth District of Xincai County, the director elected by the members is irresponsible. In Liancun Cooperative of the Seventh District, the cadres, since the establishment of the cooperative, still do not know how many members there are, or how much share capital there is; the cadres pass the buck, and the amount of funds has never been clarified. Some people joined the cooperative at the beginning of last year but still have not received their membership cards by the end of the year, which has caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. Liancun Cooperative is even more chaotic in its finances, with accounts that are purely "conscience-based," and no one ever knows how much merchandise is sold or how much money is collected. The cooperative cadres take whatever amount of money they pull out of their pockets; the money, goods, and accounts never match up. Some cooperatives sell goods without checking membership cards, allowing illegal merchants to take the opportunity to purchase goods in bulk and reap exorbitant profits. Some grassroots cooperatives also violate policies by selling off the remaining wheat lent to the masses without the approval of the grain company.

    Because the business of various grassroots cooperatives is chaotic, some bad elements are given the opportunity to exploit loopholes. Therefore, embezzlement, theft, and misappropriation of share capital often occur in county cooperatives and various grassroots cooperatives. For example, Songgang Cooperative once had over 11 million yuan stolen; Zhangzhai Cooperative had over 1100 jin of sesame stolen last September. According to incomplete statistics, over the past year, there have been 18 cases of embezzlement, theft, and misappropriation of public funds of various sizes in the county's grassroots cooperatives, resulting in losses of over 25 million yuan. I suggest that relevant departments conduct an in-depth inspection of the cooperative work in Xincai County in order to improve the work and eliminate this chaotic phenomenon.

    河南省新蔡县某些合作社
    业务混乱贪污偷盗现象严重
    有关部门应迅速检查处理
    编辑同志：河南省新蔡县某些基层合作社的根子扎得不正，干部不纯，以致发生严重的脱离群众现象，使公共财产遭受很大损失。新蔡县五区陈砦社社员选出的主任不负责；七区练村社的干部自立社到现在，还不知道有多少社员，多少股金；干部你推我，我推你，资金数字一直搞不清。有些群众去年年初入社，到年底还没有领到社员证，群众对这件事非常不满。练村社在财务上更是一塌糊涂，账目都是“良心账”，从来就没有人知道卖多少货，收多少钱；合作社干部从布袋里掏出多少是多少；钱、货、账从来没有弄对头。有些合作社卖货不看社员证，以致不法商人乘机套购，牟取暴利。还有些基层社违反政策，不经过粮食公司批准，擅自把贷给群众剩余部分的小麦卖掉。
    由于各基层社业务混乱，给一些坏分子造成钻空子的机会，因此，县社和各基层社时常发生贪污、偷盗、挪用股金等现象。如宋岗社一次就被盗走一千一百多万元；张寨社去年九月被盗芝麻一千一百多斤。据不完全统计，一年来，这个县的各基层社发生大小贪污、偷盗、挪用公款等事件共十八起，损失二千五百多万元。我建议有关部门深入检查新蔡县的合作社工作，以便改进工作，消灭这种混乱现象。
