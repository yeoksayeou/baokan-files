    Remember Chairman Mao's Words, Overcome the Ideology of Pursuing Enjoyment

    To the Editor: The case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan shows that the erosion of the Communist Party by bourgeois ideology has become a very serious problem. Although Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan had withstood the test of long revolutionary struggles and did not succumb or surrender before enemies with guns, they quickly became thieves who stole state property under the bombardment of bourgeois sugar-coated bullets. I recall that when I first joined the revolutionary ranks, although life was very hard, my work enthusiasm was very high. Soon, however, an ideology of pursuing enjoyment began to grow. For example, I was not satisfied with the life of eating rice and white flour and wearing fine cloth uniforms, and I demanded even greater enjoyment. This was influenced by bourgeois ideology. If this kind of thinking develops, it will inevitably lead to corruption and degeneration, turning oneself into a criminal against the country.

    Chairman Mao said: "Some individual cadres are tempted by material things… and are completely corrupted. A number of other cadres have become moldy and need to be exposed to the sun to recover their health." ("Economic and Financial Problems," December 1942) These are two very important sentences. I hope that every revolutionary worker will review them again to thoroughly eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology.

    记住毛主席的话，克服追求享受的思想
    编辑同志：从刘青山、张子善的事件中，可以看出资产阶级思想对共产党的侵蚀，已成为一个很严重的问题。刘青山、张子善虽经过长期革命斗争的考验，在拿枪的敌人面前没有屈服没有投降，但在资产阶级的糖衣裹着的炮弹的打击下，却很快地变成偷盗国家财产的盗贼。回忆我刚参加革命队伍时，虽然生活很苦，工作情绪却很高。不久就开始滋长了一种追求享受的思想。例如对吃大米白面、穿细布制服的生活还不满足，要求更高的享受，这就是受了资产阶级思想的影响。这种思想发展下去，势必使自己贪污腐化，变成国家的罪人。
    毛主席说：“有个别的干部是被物质所诱惑……完全腐化了。另有若干干部则起了霉，要在太阳底下晒一晒才能恢复健康。”（“经济问题与财政问题”一九四二年十二月）这是很重要的两句话，希望每一个革命工作人员重新温习一下，以彻底肃清资产阶级思想的影响。
