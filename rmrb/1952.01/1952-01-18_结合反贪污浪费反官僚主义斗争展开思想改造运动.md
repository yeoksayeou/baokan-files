    Launch Ideological Remolding Movement in Conjunction with the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucratism
    Li Jishen
    Since the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference responded to Chairman Mao's call and passed the resolution to launch a broad ideological remolding movement, it has further promoted the self-education and self-remolding movement of people from all walks of life. Recently, the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference issued a decision on launching an ideological remolding study movement for people from all walks of life, and notified that the current study should focus on the content of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucratism. The struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism has been widely launched throughout the country. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the whole country enthusiastically participate in this magnificent mass struggle, and temper and transform themselves in the heat of the movement. There is no doubt that all democratic parties and progressive people from all walks of life must play a leading role in this great struggle among the masses they are connected with.

    Since the establishment of the Central People's Government two years ago, the great victory in the struggle against imperialism and feudalism and the rapid development of the people's economic construction have made everyone realize that this is a remarkable achievement of the people's democratic united front led by the working class, and especially realized that this is the brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution. In the face of this great victory, all democratic parties and people from all walks of life have received great education and confirmed that in order to consolidate and develop the people's democratic united front, thoroughly implement the Common Program, and move together into socialist society according to the correct historical development process, the first thing to do is to thoroughly transform their thinking. That is to say, we must conscientiously study the great and correct Mao Zedong Thought to criticize and transform our own thinking, that is, to criticize all bad thoughts that are opposed to the leading ideology of the new democratic China, the ideology of the working class, as well as the bad habits and bad styles formed on the basis of those bad thoughts.

    The participation of the petty bourgeoisie or the national bourgeoisie in the people's democratic united front regime is to recognize that this regime is based on the worker-peasant alliance and led by the working class and its party, the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, accepting the leadership of the working class ideology, Mao Zedong Thought, is the historical task of the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie, and it is also the main foundation for consolidating the people's democratic united front regime. The preamble to the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference solemnly states: "The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference unanimously agrees to take New Democracy, that is, People's Democracy, as the political foundation for the founding of the People's Republic of China." New Democratic society is a historical era of transition from the old society to socialist society, and the future is to move towards socialist and then communist society. The main historical task of this era is to transform other classes under the leadership of the working class ideology and create conditions for the realization of socialism, which naturally requires the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie to transform themselves under the education of Mao Zedong Thought. From the perspective of the current situation, the struggles of the remaining forces of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism have indeed been defeated and even eliminated by us, but the bad thoughts, bad habits, and bad styles left over from the enemy's long-term rule still stubbornly remain in the social ideology. Therefore, we should earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought, on the one hand, vigorously eliminate the filth spread by internal and external reactionaries in the field of social ideology, and on the other hand, resolutely combat the corrupt and degenerate thoughts of the national bourgeoisie, which is necessary in terms of strengthening the dictatorship over the enemy and consolidating democracy within the people.

    Ideological remolding cannot be achieved without fierce self-struggle. We cannot imagine that two opposing ideas can alternate peacefully. Therefore, combining with practical struggles is the main way to transform thinking. If the rotten is not removed, the new will not grow. The painful process of creating the new from the corrupt is unavoidable. In fact, in the past two years, the conscious demand of all democratic parties and people from all walks of life to study Mao Zedong Thought has become a widespread movement. In the past year, combined with the practical struggles of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, they themselves and the masses they have led have improved a lot in their thinking, which has greatly developed the people's democratic united front.

    The current situation requires the people of the whole country to strive for further development of the three major movements and the victories on the people's defense, finance, economy, culture, and education fronts on the basis of the victories of the previous two years, and to strive to complete all the preparations necessary for the country's basic construction. In this situation, the widespread, sustained, and in-depth ideological remolding movement has become our major task at present. The decision of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was made based on this requirement. This decision has clear provisions on the content of ideological remolding study. That is to say, we must not only eliminate the enemy's reactionary thoughts in the social ideology, but also further criticize and transform the thoughts of the national bourgeoisie, that is, to strike and eradicate their corrupt and degenerate thoughts. If we do not do this and allow it to develop, it will benefit the enemy and be detrimental to the unity of the people's democratic united front. Therefore, the provisions made by the Standing Committee of the National Committee on the content of the current ideological remolding study are fully adapted to the current situation and requirements.

    The current nationwide struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism is actually a large classroom for the ideological remolding study of the people of the whole country, especially all democratic parties and people from all walks of life. If we successfully achieve this goal of ideological remolding, it is possible to better accept Mao Zedong Thought. The more thoroughly the bad thoughts, bad habits, and bad styles are removed, the faster the new and correct thoughts will be absorbed, and then it is expected to gradually approach the thoughts of the working class.

    Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, is the guide for revolutionary action and the weapon of revolutionary struggle. Only by personally participating in the struggle and combining it with practice in the struggle can we become familiar with this weapon. Therefore, the people of New China, especially all democratic parties and people from all walks of life, should bravely take the lead in participating in the current vigorous struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism, strive to be activists in the struggle, and humbly understand in the struggle. If we can really do this, then our academic achievements in ideological remolding will definitely be very fruitful.

    结合反贪污浪费反官僚主义斗争展开思想改造运动
    李济深
    自从人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议，响应毛主席的号召，通过广泛展开思想改造运动的决议以后，推动了各阶层人民和各界人士自我教育和自我改造运动的进一步开展。最近人民政协全国委员会常务委员会发布关于展开各界人士思想改造学习运动的决定，并通知目前学习即以反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义为内容。反贪污浪费，反官僚主义的斗争，已在全国范围广泛展开，全国人民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，热情地参加这个波澜壮阔的群众性斗争，在热火朝天的运动中锻炼与改造自己。毫无疑问，各民主党派，各界进步人士在这个伟大斗争中，在其所联系的群众中，必须起带头的作用。
    中央人民政府成立两年来，反帝国主义反封建主义斗争的伟大胜利，和人民经济建设事业的迅速发展，大家都认识到这是工人阶级为领导的人民民主统一战线的卓越成就，尤其体会到这是马列主义普遍真理与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想的辉煌胜利。各民主党派、各界人士在伟大胜利形势下，受到很大的教育，确认为着巩固与发展人民民主统一战线，彻底实现共同纲领，更进而依循正确的历史发展进程共同进入社会主义社会，首先必须彻底地改造思想。这就是说，我们要认真学习伟大的正确的毛泽东思想，来批判改造自己的思想，亦即批判一切与新民主主义中国的领导思想工人阶级思想对立的一切坏思想，以及从那些坏思想基础上造成的坏习惯和坏作风。
    小资产阶级或民族资产阶级参加人民民主统一战线的政权，是承认这个政权以工农联盟为基础，以工人阶级及其政党中国共产党为领导的，所以接受工人阶级思想毛泽东思想的领导，就是小资产阶级和民族资产阶级的历史任务，也是巩固人民民主统一战线政权的主要基础。人民政协共同纲领的序言中，庄严地写着：“中国人民政治协商会议一致同意以新民主主义即人民民主主义为中华人民共和国建国的政治基础”。新民主主义社会乃是由旧的社会过渡到社会主义社会的一个历史时代，前途是要走向社会主义更进而到共产主义社会的。这个时代的历史任务，主要地就是在工人阶级思想领导之下，改造其他阶级，为社会主义的实现创造条件，这自然就要求小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，在毛泽东思想教育下改造自己。再就目前形势要求说，帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义的残余势力的挣扎，固然都被我们击败乃至肃清了，可是敌人长期统治下所遗留下的坏思想坏习惯坏作风，还顽固地残留于社会思想意识中。因此我们即应认真学习毛泽东思想，一方面大力扫除内外反动派在社会思想意识领域中所撒下的烂污，另一方面还要坚决打击民族资产阶级的腐化堕落思想，这无论在强化对敌人专政和巩固人民内部民主方面，都是必要的。
    思想改造非通过激烈的自我斗争不可，我们不能设想两个敌对思想之间能够和平交替。因此，结合实际的斗争锻炼，是改造思想的主要途径。腐的不去，新的不生，封腐生新，痛苦过程是回避不了的。事实上，两年以来，各民主党派、各界人士自觉地要求学习毛泽东思想，已经成为广泛的运动，去年一年中，结合抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命的实际斗争，他们自己和他们所带动的群众，在思想上都提高了不少，使人民民主统一战线大大地发展了。
    当前的形势，要求全国人民在前两年的胜利基础上面，争取更进一步发展三大运动和人民的国防、财经、文教等战线的胜利，争取完成为进行国家基本建设所必需的一切准备工作。在这个形势下，普遍展开持久深入的思想改造运动，就成为我们当前的重大任务了。人民政协全国委员会常务委员会的决定，便是根据这个要求作出来的。这个决定对于思想改造学习的内容，有明确的规定。就是说，我们不仅要在社会思想意识中扫除敌人的反动思想，而且要进一步批判改造民族资产阶级的思想，即予他们的腐化堕落思想以打击和铲除。如果不这样，而让它发展下去，将会有利于敌人，而不利于人民民主统一战线的团结。所以全国委员会常务委员会关于目前改造思想学习的内容所作的规定，是完全适应目前的形势和要求的。
    当前全国规模的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，实际上就是全国人民，尤其是各民主党派、各界人士思想改造的学习的大课堂。如果我们胜利地达到了这个思想改造的目标，就有可能更好地接受毛泽东思想。坏思想、坏习惯、坏作风愈去的彻底，新的正确的思想就吸收得愈快，然后可望一步步和工人阶级的思想相接近了。
    马列主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想是革命行动的指南，是革命斗争的武器，只有亲身参加斗争，结合在斗争中的实践，才能熟习这个武器。因此新中国的人民，尤其是各民主党派、各界人士，应该勇敢地带头参加目前轰轰烈烈的反贪污、反浪费和反官僚主义的斗争，争取作斗争中的积极分子，在斗争中虚心体会。果然能够这样，那末，我们思想改造的学习成绩就一定是非常丰硕的。
