Correcting the Tendency of Scientific Publications to Deviate from Politics and Reality
——A Review of "Science Bulletin" Volume II
Gong Yuzhi

"Science Bulletin," compiled and printed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is a comprehensive scientific publication aimed at science and technology workers. Volume II has now been completed. Reviewing "Science Bulletin" over the past year, it can be seen that it has achieved certain successes. For example, introducing the advanced scientific achievements of the Soviet Union, reporting on new creations in China's industrial construction and science and technology over the past two years, and the criticism of the preface to "Research on the Sani Language" are all very beneficial works. However, this article does not intend to dwell on the achievements but prepares to focus on analyzing the other aspect. "Science Bulletin" has had many serious shortcomings over the past year, showing a tendency to deviate from politics and reality, which urgently needs to be corrected.

First of all, in terms of the editorial policy of "Science Bulletin," the points about propagating Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and about taking Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought as the highest guiding principle of China's scientific research work are unclear. Any publication that neglects this kind of ideological work will never achieve satisfactory results. The tendency of "Science Bulletin" to deviate from politics and reality is mainly manifested in this point.

For example, when the People's Daily republished Chairman Mao's "On Practice," "Science Bulletin" not only did not reprint it, but even did not report on it, for such an important Marxist-Leninist scientific work. It seemed as if "On Practice" was just a philosophical paper and had nothing to do with science. Later, the People's Daily successively published editorials "Study Comrade Mao Zedong's 'On Practice'" and "'On Practice' Opens Up the Ideological Path for Our Academic Revolution," clearly calling on "the academic circles (including social sciences and natural sciences) must seriously study Comrade Mao Zedong's 'On Practice,'" and "in all aspects and departments of our academic circles, we should seriously discuss 'On Practice.'" After such a call was made, "Science Bulletin" still did not pay enough attention to it. It did not call on, organize, or guide scientific workers to study "On Practice" and the People's Daily editorials to transform their thinking and improve their work. Only three articles of scientific workers' learning experiences were published in the May and August issues of last year, which is so slow and indifferent!

The publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is the most important event in the political life of the Chinese people, and also in the scientific life of the Chinese people. However, "Science Bulletin" only printed a purely reporting message of about 700 words on the cover that never prints words.

The Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference made a decision on continuing to strengthen the three central tasks of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing economy, and ideological remolding. Many people from the scientific community participated in this meeting, and Vice President Li Siguang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also made a special speech at the meeting. Regarding these, there was no reflection in the November and December issues of "Science Bulletin" last year.

"Science Bulletin" has announced that its task is "to focus on reporting and introducing." Due to the lack of political guidance from Mao Zedong Thought, these reports and introductions are often objectivist and piecemeal. People cannot see what purpose these reports and introductions are intended to achieve, what to support, what to oppose, and what problems to solve. Therefore, these things have not played their due role in guiding practical work.

From the reports of "Science Bulletin" on domestic scientific work, it is difficult for us to appreciate the principle of combining scientific research and production as instructed by the State Council. The reports on ductile iron research and safe cottonseed oil emulsion research, which have made great contributions to production, are drowned in a large number of secondary and dispensable reports. What problems were solved and what directions were pointed out at the many national congresses of specialized societies held last summer, "Science Bulletin" lacks explanation. Recently, the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a general affairs meeting and raised many important issues related to the national scientific work, but these issues have not been reflected.

In this way, "Science Bulletin" either did not realize these important events at all, or realized them but did not seriously introduce and discuss them, thus reducing the role it should play in political and ideological education and guidance in scientific work.

"Science Bulletin" emphasized its task of introducing foreign science. It introduced the scientific conditions of some bourgeois countries. Of course, this is entirely possible. Only when introducing, we should have our own position and never follow behind the bourgeoisie and carry out reactionary political propaganda for them. Unfortunately, "Science Bulletin" often makes mistakes in this regard.

"Science Bulletin" published an article "The Assam Earthquake on August 15, 1950" in the June issue last year, and another article "Adventure Story of the Assam Earthquake" in the July issue last year; both articles were translated from the British magazine "Nature." However, the so-called "Assam Earthquake" actually occurred in Chayu County, Xikang Province, China. The author of "Adventure Story," "Kingdon-Ward," is the imperialist element "Jinhua Dong" who has been rampant in Sichuan, Xikang, and Yunnan for many years. The translator and editor followed behind the imperialists and said that Chinese land was Indian land. The July issue of "Science Bulletin" also published a "Brief History of the Centennial of the Geological Survey of India," which was also translated from the British magazine "Nature." The article heavily promoted the "benevolence" of imperialists to the colonial people, and described some aggressors as "the father of Indian geology," and so on. The translator and editor published it verbatim.

The error in the article "The Assam Earthquake" has been pointed out by readers, and the translator has made corrections and published them in "Science Bulletin."

The translator of the article "A Brief History of the Centennial of the Geological Survey of India" also made a review in the translation bulletin. However, the editors of "Science Bulletin" have not made a profound public self-criticism.

As mentioned earlier, "Science Bulletin" has made achievements in introducing Soviet science. But this is still far from enough. For example, in the foreign newsletter column of the May issue last year, most of the news was from the United Kingdom and the United States, and some of these news were trivial things such as "fish can make sounds" and "the shortest fish in the world." The April issue last year introduced "Polymer Chemistry," which introduced a large number of British and American books and periodicals, but completely ignored the contributions and achievements of the Soviet Union in this field.

The sloppy style in editing work is also serious. For example, in the translation of "New Achievements in Protein Research" in the April issue last year, there was actually an erroneous sentence "Under the inspection of the kaleidoscope, the chromatogram shows that we can identify the structure of a certain protein." In the article "Soviet Linguistics Embarks on a New Path" in the September issue last year, only half of the original text published on the second page of the Truth Daily was translated, and the other half on the third page was discarded by the translator; there were also many errors in the translation. This phenomenon makes people doubt whether the editorial department of "Science Bulletin" has a checking system.

It should be mentioned that the editors of "Science Bulletin" made some inspections in the twelfth issue last year, but this inspection lacks the spirit of practical criticism and self-criticism. The editors focused the inspection on technical issues, and did not conduct a profound review of a series of political errors, find out its ideological roots, and did not put forward specific improvement methods.

In summary, we can see that the main mistake of "Science Bulletin" lies in deviating from politics and deviating from reality. It does not seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, does not seriously study the State Council's instructions on scientific research serving production, adopts an objectivist attitude towards science, and even has a vague position at some times and makes political mistakes.

It should be pointed out that the above-mentioned errors are not unique to "Science Bulletin." Other scientific publications have more or less similar errors. This situation is inseparable from the supra-political and supra-class thinking of some scientific workers. They "worship the United Kingdom and the United States, believe in Germany and Japan, doubt the Soviet Union, and despise themselves." They also do not realize that although natural science itself has no class nature, it is bound to be guided by the world outlook of a certain class, and it always serves the production struggle and political struggle of a certain class. Natural science workers must also participate in social life. They either belong to this class or that class. In the past, science served the reactionary ruling class. Today, under the new democratic system, Chinese science has become the science of the people for the first time in history. Scientific workers should fully recognize this transformation, consciously use the proletarian world outlook to transform their thinking, serve the people, and serve the new democratic economy and politics. Only in this way can Chinese science develop and prosper rapidly. Separating from politics, separating from reality, and separating from the people, any scientific undertaking will gradually shrink.

We hope that "Science Bulletin" and other scientific publications will actively improve their editing work and take on the task of organizing the ideological remolding movement in the scientific community. We suggest that the Chinese Academy of Sciences strengthen its leadership over "Science Bulletin" so that "Science Bulletin" can become a scientific publication with a high degree of political and ideological character.

    纠正科学刊物中脱离政治脱离实际的倾向
    ——评“科学通报”第二卷
    龚育之
    中国科学院编印的“科学通报”，是以科学技术工作者为对象的综合性的科学刊物。它现在已经出完了第二卷。翻阅这一年来的“科学通报”，可以看出它是有一定的成绩的。例如介绍苏联的先进科学成就，报道两年来我国工业建设和科学技术中的新创造，以及关于“撒尼语研究”序文的批评等，都是很有益的工作。但是这里不打算多谈成绩这一方面，而准备着重分析另一方面。“科学通报”一年来有不少严重的缺点，表现了脱离政治脱离实际的倾向，这是迫切需要加以纠正的。
    首先，在“科学通报”的编辑方针方面，关于宣传马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，关于把马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想作为中国科学研究工作的最高指导原则这一点是不明确的。而任何刊物要是忽视了这种思想工作，就绝不可能获得令人满意的成绩。“科学通报”的脱离政治、脱离实际的倾向，主要的也就表现在这一点上。
    举例来说吧，当人民日报重新发表了毛主席的“实践论”的时候，对于这样重要的马克思列宁主义的科学著作，“科学通报”不但没有转载，甚至没有报道。好像“实践论”只是一篇哲学论文，跟科学没有关系似的。后来人民日报又先后发表了“学习毛泽东同志的‘实践论’”和“‘实践论’开辟了我们学术革命的思想道路”的社论，明确地号召“学术界（包括社会科学和自然科学）都必须认真研究毛泽东同志的‘实践论’”，“在我们的学术界各方面，各部门，应该认真地讨论‘实践论’”。在提出这样的号召之后，“科学通报”也仍然没有予以足够的重视。它并没有号召、组织、指导科学工作者学习“实践论”和人民日报的社论，来改造思想，改进工作。仅仅在去年五月号和八月号上才发表了三篇科学工作者的学习心得，这是多么迟钝和冷漠啊！
    “毛泽东选集”的出版是中国人民政治生活中，同时也是中国人民的科学生活中最重大的事件。可是“科学通报”也只在从来不印字的封里印了一条七百字左右的纯报道性质的消息。
    人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议作出了关于继续加强抗美援朝、增产节约、思想改造三项中心工作的决定，许多科学界人士参加了这次会，科学院李四光副院长还在会上作了专题发言。关于这些，“科学通报”去年十一月号和十二月号上也没有一点反映。
    “科学通报”曾宣布它的任务是“偏重于报道和介绍”。由于脱离了毛泽东思想的政治指导，这些报道和介绍常是客观主义的、东鳞西爪的。人们看不出这些报道和介绍究竟要达到什么目的，要赞成什么，反对什么，要解决什么问题。因此，这些东西也就没有起到它们应有的指导实际工作的作用。
    从“科学通报”对国内科学工作的报道中，我们很难体会到政务院所指示的科学研究和生产结合的方针。对于生产很有贡献的球墨铸铁研究和安全棉油乳剂研究的报道，被淹没在大量次要的、可有可无的报道之中。去年暑期召开的许多专门学会全国代表大会，解决了什么问题，指出了什么方向，“科学通报”都缺少说明。最近科学院开了院务会议，提出了许多有关全国科学工作的重要问题，可是这些问题也都没有反映。
    这样，这些重要事件，“科学通报”或者是根本没有认识到，或者是认识到而没有认真地介绍、论述，因此，就降低了它在科学工作中所应起的政治思想教育的作用和指导作用。
    “科学通报”强调了它介绍国外科学的任务。它介绍了一些资产阶级国家的科学状况。当然，这是完全可以的。只是在介绍的时候，我们应该有自己的立场，绝不能跟在资产阶级后面，替他们作反动的政治宣传。可惜，“科学通报”在这一方面却常犯错误。
    “科学通报”去年六月号上发表了“一九五○年八月十五日阿萨密大地震”一文，去年七月号上又发表了“阿萨密地震历险记”一文；两文都是从英国的“自然”杂志上翻译过来的。然而，所谓“阿萨密大地震”实际上是发生在我国西康省察隅县的地震。“历险记”的作者“金顿·瓦尔得”就是多年来横行在四川、西康、云南一带的帝国主义分子“金华栋”。译者和编者都跟在帝国主义者的后面，把中国土地说成是印度土地了。去年七月号“科学通报”还发表了一篇“印度地质调查所百年简史”，也是从英国的“自然”杂志上翻译过来的。文中大事宣传帝国主义者给殖民地人民的“恩惠”，把一些侵略分子说成是“印度地质学之父”等等。译者和编者竟原封不动地把它登出来。
    所谓“阿萨密大地震”一文的错误，已经有读者指出，由译者作了更正，在“科学通报”上登载了。
    “印度地质调查所百年简史”一文的译者也在翻译通报上做了检讨。但“科学通报”的编者却没有作过深刻的公开的自我批评。
    前面提到了，“科学通报”在介绍苏联科学方面是有成绩的。但这仍然是很不够的。比如在去年五月号的国外简讯栏中，大多数消息是英美国家的，而这些消息有一些是“鱼能发音”、“世界最短的鱼”等无关宏旨的东西。去年四月号上介绍“高聚物化学”，大量介绍了英美的书刊，却完全漠视了苏联在这方面的贡献和成就。
    编辑工作中的草率作风也是严重的。例如去年四月号上“蛋白质研究的新成就”译文中，竟出现了“在万花镜的检视下，所呈现的色谱，我们可鉴定出某种蛋白质的构造”这种错误的字句。去年九月号上“苏维埃语言学走上了新的道路”一文，竟然只翻译了登载在真理报第二版上的原文的一半，第三版上另一半竟被译者丢掉了；译文的错误也很多。这种现象使人怀疑“科学通报”编辑部到底有没有核对的制度。
    应该提到的，“科学通报”编者在去年十二期上做了一些检查，但是这个检查是缺乏切实的批评和自我批评的精神的。编者把检查的重点放在带有技术性的问题上面，没有对一系列的政治性的错误进行深刻的检讨，找出它的思想上的根源，也没有提出具体的改进的办法。
    综上所述，我们可以看出来，“科学通报”的主要错误在于脱离政治，脱离实际。它不认真学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，不认真研究政务院关于科学研究为生产服务的指示，对待科学采取一种客观主义的态度，以至在有些时候立场模糊，犯了政治性的错误。
    应该指出，上述一些错误并不仅仅是“科学通报”所独有的，科学界的其他刊物却有或多或少的类似的错误，这种情况和一部分科学工作者超政治超阶级的思想是分不开的。他们“崇拜英美，迷信德日，怀疑苏联，卑视自己”。他们也不认识，自然科学本身虽没有阶级性，但它却是必然以某一阶级的世界观为指南的，它总是要为某一阶级的生产斗争和政治斗争服务的，自然科学工作者也要参加社会生活，他不是属于这一个阶级就是属于那一个阶级。过去的科学是为反动统治阶级服务的。今天，在新民主主义制度下，中国的科学有史以来第一次成为人民的科学。科学工作者应该充分认识这一转变，自觉地用无产阶级的世界观来改造自己的思想，为人民服务，为新民主主义的经济和政治服务，只有这样，中国的科学才会迅速发展和繁荣起来。脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离人民，任何科学事业都是会日益萎缩下去的。
    我们希望，“科学通报”以及其他科学刊物积极改进编辑工作，担负起组织科学界思想改造运动的任务。我们建议中国科学院加强对“科学通报”的领导，使“科学通报”成为一个具有高度政治性、思想性的科学刊物。
