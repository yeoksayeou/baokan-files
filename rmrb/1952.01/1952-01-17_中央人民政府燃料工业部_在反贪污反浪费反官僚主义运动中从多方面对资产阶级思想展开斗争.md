    The Ministry of Fuel Industry Under the Central People's Government Launches a Multifaceted Struggle Against Bourgeois Ideology in the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement

    Since January 4th, after responsible cadres at all levels made self-criticisms at cadre meetings, the Ministry of Fuel Industry under the Central People's Government has fundamentally changed the situation where some leading cadres previously did not pay enough attention to the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement and were afraid to boldly mobilize the masses. Now, the masses have been widely mobilized, and criticism and self-criticism have been launched. Those who rarely spoke before and those who had always stood outside the movement are now rushing to speak and offer opinions, and the mood is very enthusiastic and tense. This is an unprecedented and extremely enthusiastic democratic movement that the Ministry of Fuel Industry under the Central People's Government has never had since its establishment.

    Many people were moved by the sincere self-criticisms of the leading cadres. One engineer said after listening to Minister Chen Yu's self-criticism: "Now I understand the difference between the old and new societies even more." Some people were so moved that they shed tears on the spot. Comrades from the Geological Office of the Coal Mine Management Bureau said: "Now that the leading comrades can reflect like this, we guarantee to explain our problems clearly within three days." After listening to the self-criticisms of the leading cadres, Chen Dachun of the Petroleum Management Bureau couldn't sleep at night and got up at three in the morning to confess to his comrades that he had deposited public funds in the bank and embezzled 40,000 yuan in interest. In the four days that followed, fourteen people voluntarily confessed to embezzlement, totaling 21 million yuan (together with the 77 cases confessed before the 4th, the embezzled funds totaled more than 130 million yuan).

    As of January 10th, the main focus of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Ministry of Fuel Industry under the Central People's Government is to oppose bureaucracy. Leading cadres have been strictly criticized for not understanding or studying the actual situation at the lower levels, being aloof, or working hard but in vain. The masses demand very strict standards from leading cadres. They expressed dissatisfaction with those leading cadres whose self-criticisms were not deep enough and demanded that they make self-criticisms again and again. The scope of the problems exposed in the movement is very broad, including "democratic style," "cadre policy," "organizational structure, division of tasks," "relationships between superiors and subordinates," and "not being at ease with work."

    There is also a lot of criticism from the masses towards non-Party leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel, criticizing their employee mentality, sojourner mentality, conservative views on technology, failure to accept the suggestions of Soviet experts, and purely technical viewpoints. The masses were particularly critical of their irresponsible and perfunctory attitude towards work, saying that they "consider themselves old personnel," "push upwards and rely downwards," and "make plans in the spring, process documents in the summer, approve in the autumn, and cut everything off in the winter (i.e., summarize work for the New Year)." Although some of these non-Party leading cadres and technical personnel still have a "getting by" mentality, most of them have realized that this movement is not about opposing the erosion of bourgeois ideology, but about how to eliminate their own remnants of bourgeois ideology and transform themselves.

    Currently, on the basis of the continuously improving awareness of the masses, the Ministry of Fuel Industry under the Central People's Government is preparing to gradually shift the movement from the high tide of universal self-criticism and reporting to an in-depth examination of the employee mentality and purely technical viewpoints in planning and construction work, as well as the serious waste in production and capital construction caused by bureaucracy, in units with a large number of technical personnel (Planning and Construction Departments). The management departments will conduct an in-depth examination of the financial work of various bureaus and the corruption and waste in various procurement units. The Ministry of Fuel Industry under the Central People's Government has organized six inspection teams to inspect the financial affairs of the organs, electricity costs, backlog of materials, organ expenses, and expenditure of operating funds, and is preparing to educate the masses with specific examples of waste and corruption cases that are uncovered, so as to deepen the movement.

    中央人民政府燃料工业部
    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中从多方面对资产阶级思想展开斗争
    中央人民政府燃料工业部自本月四日起，各级负责干部在干部大会上做了自我检讨以后，根本转变了在这以前有些领导干部对于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动不够重视和不敢放手发动群众的情况。现在，群众已经普遍地发动起来，展开了批评与自我批评。从来不大发言的和历来站在运动以外的人，也都抢着发言、提意见，情绪十分热烈紧张。这是中央人民政府燃料工业部成立以来从来没有过的、空前热烈的民主运动。
    很多人为领导干部的诚恳的检讨所感动。一个工程师听了陈郁部长的检讨以后说：“现在我更体会到新旧社会的不同。”有的人感动得当场流泪。煤矿管理总局地质室的同志们表示：“领导同志都能这样反省，我们保证三天以内把自己的问题交代清楚。”石油管理总局陈大椿听了领导干部的检讨后，夜晚睡不着，三更时候起床向同志们坦白自己拿公款存在银行里，贪污利息四万元。四日以后，自动坦白贪污的十四人，贪污款项共二千一百万元（连同四日以前坦白的共七十七起，贪污款项共一亿三千余万元）。
    到本月十日止，中央人民政府燃料工业部的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的主要锋芒是反对官僚主义。领导干部对于下层实际情况不了解，不研究，高高在上或辛辛苦苦，都受到了严格的批评。群众要求领导干部非常严格。他们对那些检讨得不深刻的领导干部表示不满，要求他们一次又一次地检讨。在运动中揭发的问题的范围很广，连“民主作风”、“干部政策”、“组织机构，任务分工”、“上下级关系”和“不安心工作”等，都被提出来了。
    群众对于非党的领导干部和工程技术人员的批评也很多，批评了他们的雇佣观点、作客思想、技术上的保守观点、不接受苏联专家建议以及单纯技术观点。群众对于他们在工作中不负责任、敷衍塞责的态度，批评得特别尖锐，说他们是“旧人员自居”，“上推下靠”，“春天做计划，夏天办公文，秋天批准，冬天一刀两断（即总结工作过年）。”这些非党领导干部和技术人员，虽然还有部分人有“过关”思想，但大部分人已经认识到：这个运动对于他们不是反对资产阶级思想侵蚀问题，而是如何肃清自己的资产阶级思想残余和改造自己的问题。
    目前，中央人民政府燃料工业部在群众觉悟不断提高的基础上，准备在技术人员较多的单位（计划、修建两司），把运动从普遍检讨和检举的高潮，逐渐地引向深入检查计划、修建工作中的雇佣观点以及单纯技术观点和因官僚主义所造成的生产和基本建设中的严重浪费。经理部门则深入检查各局的财务工作和各采购单位的贪污浪费。中央人民政府燃料工业部组织了六个检查组，检查机关的财务、电业成本、器材积压、机关开支、事业费开支等，并准备以检查出来的具体的浪费现象和贪污案件教育群众，使运动更加深入。
