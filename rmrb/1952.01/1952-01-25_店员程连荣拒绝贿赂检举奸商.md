    Shop Assistant Cheng Lianrong Rejects Bribery and Exposes Unscrupulous Merchant
    Lin Mo
    Cheng Lianrong, a young shop assistant at the privately owned Tongsheng Paint Store in Tianjin, refused a bribe of 100 million yuan from the capitalist and resolutely exposed the capitalist's illegal activities in the campaign against bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property. Currently, more than 40,000 shop employees in Tianjin have formed a powerful front to counter the bourgeoisie's attack and are launching a fierce struggle against illegal merchants. Cheng Lianrong is a staunch fighter standing at the forefront of this struggle.
    The capitalist of the privately owned Tongsheng Paint Store frequently adulterated goods, selling inferior goods as high-quality ones; created false accounts to evade taxes; and bribed revolutionary cadres with gold. Using various despicable methods, they defrauded the state of approximately 400 million yuan.
    Cheng Lianrong had long been aware of the capitalist's various illegal activities. In the past, under the suppression and deception of the manager, Liu Xiyou, he could only suppress these matters in his heart. After the start of the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-theft of state property campaign in Tianjin's business community, Cheng Lianrong immediately launched a fierce ideological struggle. He wanted to expose the capitalist's illegal activities, but he had many concerns: he and the manager, Liu Xiyou, were from the same hometown, his father and Liu were friends for many years, and he was introduced to the store because of this relationship. He thought: if I expose Liu Xiyou, wouldn't I be on bad terms with him? If the capitalist is punished and the business closes down, what will happen to my job? Cheng Lianrong thought again: the capitalist has defrauded the state of a large amount of property, indulging in eating, drinking, and pleasure, and using these ill-gotten gains to corrupt revolutionary cadres. This property is the blood and sweat of the working people! As a member of the working class, how can I cover up these despicable and shameless acts of the capitalist? Cheng Lianrong also thought: Liu Xiyou has made a lot of money since liberation, but the lives of the store's employees are very hard. The shop assistants work hard, have low wages, and are politically suppressed by the capitalist. Everyone works all day long, and sometimes they have to work overtime at night. In winter, some shop assistants sleep on the cold cement floor. Some shop assistants get sick from exhaustion, but the capitalist not only does not provide medical treatment but also says that they are sick from overeating. How can such a person not be exposed?
    Liu Xiyou, fearing that the employees would expose his illegal activities to the government, adopted various methods to deceive and oppress the employees. He consistently obstructed the shop assistants from joining the trade union and ordered his confidants to monitor the employees' actions. Liu Xiyou openly said: Shop assistants joining the trade union will affect the business of the counter. He even threatened the shop assistants, saying, "If you ruin the business, the trade union will not find you a job." "You are making trouble with the trade union now, but when the Kuomintang comes back one day, you won't even have time to crawl under the table." Because Liu Xiyou so arbitrarily suppressed the shop assistants, Cheng Lianrong did not dare to expose the capitalist's tax evasion when the tax bureau investigated taxes and accounts twice last year.
    Cheng Lianrong received a profound education in the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-theft of state property campaign. His class consciousness was raised, and he realized that this was the time for the working class to counterattack the bourgeoisie, and he could no longer hesitate or waver. He made up his mind to discuss it with other shop assistants. This was discovered by Liu Xiyou. A shop assistant named Zhang Laikui, who had been bought off by Liu Xiyou, secretly told Liu Xiyou that Cheng Lianrong was going to expose him. Upon hearing this news, Liu Xiyou not only did not take the initiative to confess but instead used his usual despicable methods, attempting to bribe Cheng Lianrong through Zhang Laikui.
    On the night of January 7, Zhang Laikui secretly said to Cheng Lianrong, "As long as you don't talk about our counter's affairs, our boss is willing to give you 100 million yuan." Upon hearing this, Cheng Lianrong was so angry that he said, "Even if he gives me 1 billion, I cannot lose the position of the working class and betray the interests of the country and the people. Let him honestly confess!" Cheng Lianrong told the other shop assistants about this. Everyone was very angry at the capitalist's shameless behavior, believing that this was an insult to the working class; and resolutely stated: as long as we unite and resolutely fight him, the government and the people of the whole country will support us.
    The next day, Cheng Lianrong exposed Liu Xiyou's various illegal activities at the district-wide shop assistant conference. The unscrupulous merchant Liu Xiyou, hearing that his affairs had been exposed, rushed to the store, claiming kinship and friendship, and trying to win over the shop assistants. At this time, the shop assistants all advised him to confess. Liu Xiyou had no choice but to confess his illegal activities.

    店员程连荣拒绝贿赂检举奸商
    林  沫
    天津市私营同胜号颜料庄青年店员程连荣在反对行贿、反对偷税、反对盗窃国家财产的运动中，拒绝资方一亿元的贿赂，坚决检举了资方的非法行为。在目前，天津市四万多店员工人组成了一条反击资产阶级进攻的强大战线，对不法商人展开猛烈斗争。程连荣就是站在斗争最前线的一个坚强的斗士。
    私营同胜号颜料庄的资方，经常在货物里掺假，拿坏货当好货卖；造假账，偷税；用黄金贿赂革命干部；先后用各种卑鄙方法，诈骗国家财产约四亿元。
    程连荣对资方的种种不法行为，早就看得很清楚。过去在经理刘锡祐的压制和欺骗下，他只能把这些事情压在心里。天津市工商界反行贿、反偷税、反对盗窃国家财产的运动开始后，程连荣立刻展开了激烈的思想斗争。他想检举资方的不法行为，但有许多顾虑：他和经理刘锡祐是同乡，他的父亲和刘是多年的朋友，他就是因为这种关系，被介绍到店里来的。他想：如果检举刘锡祐，不就和他闹翻了脸吗？要是资方受到处罚，生意关了门，自己的职业问题怎么办呢？程连荣又反过来想：资本家骗取了国家大量的财产，随便吃喝享乐，还拿这些赃款去腐化革命干部，这些财产都是劳动人民的血汗呵！自己是工人阶级的一分子，怎么能掩护资本家这些卑鄙无耻的行为呢？程连荣又想：刘锡祐在解放后赚了很多钱，但店内职工的生活却非常苦。店员干活重，工资低，政治上受着资方的压制。大家在白天干一天活，有时夜里还要加夜工。在冬天，有的店员睡在冰冷的洋灰地上。有的店员干活累病了，资方不但不给医治，还说他们是吃多了噎病的。像这样的人，还能不检举吗？
    刘锡祐怕职工向政府揭穿他的非法行为，采取种种方法，欺骗、压迫职工。他一贯地阻挠店员参加工会，并命令自己的亲信人员监视店员的行动。刘锡祐公然说：店员参加工会，会影响柜上的业务。他甚至威胁店员说：“你们把生意闹垮了，工会不会给你们找职业的。”“你们现在闹工会，等有一天国民党回来，看你们往桌子底下爬也爬不及。”因为刘锡祐这样横蛮地压制店员，所以去年税务局两次查税、查账时，程连荣都没有敢把资方的偷税行为揭发出来。
    程连荣在反行贿、反偷税、反对盗窃国家财产的运动中，受到了深刻的教育。他的阶级觉悟提高了，他认识到这是工人阶级反击资产阶级进攻的时候，再也不能迟疑和动摇了。他拿定了主意，去和别的店员商量。这事却被刘锡祐知道了。有个叫张来魁的店员，被刘锡祐收买了，把程连荣要检举的事情，偷偷地告诉给刘锡祐。刘锡祐听到这个消息，不但不主动地进行坦白，反而使出贯用的卑鄙手段，企图通过张来魁去收买程连荣。
    一月七日夜里，张来魁偷偷地对程连荣说：“你只要不说咱柜上的事，咱们东家情愿拿出一亿款子送给你。”程连荣一听，气得满头冒火地说：“他就是拿出十亿，我也不能失掉工人阶级的立场，出卖国家和人民的利益。让他老老实实坦白吧！”程连荣把这件事告诉其他店员。大家对资方的无耻行为非常气愤，认为这是对工人阶级的侮辱；并坚决表示：咱们只要团结起来，坚决地和他进行斗争，政府和全国人民是给咱们撑腰的。
    第二天，程连荣就在全区店员大会上检举了刘锡祐的种种不法行为。奸商刘锡祐听说自己的事情被检举了，慌忙来到店里，称亲戚、道朋友，拉拢店员。这时店员都劝他去坦白。刘锡祐没有办法，只好交代了自己的不法行为。
