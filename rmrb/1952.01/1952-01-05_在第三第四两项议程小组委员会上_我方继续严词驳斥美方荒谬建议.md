    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th: At the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice talks on the 4th, our representative denounced the other side's absurd argument of insisting on interfering in our internal affairs under the guise of "troop security." Our representative pointed out: In order to guarantee the stability of the armistice, our side suggests that both sides guarantee that no military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, and ammunition enter from outside Korea during the armistice period, but the other side, on the one hand, advocates unlimited import of military personnel and war equipment from outside Korea during the armistice period, and on the other hand, insists on restricting the construction of equipment within Korea. Whether or not equipment is constructed within Korea is entirely a matter of internal affairs and should not be brought up for discussion in the military armistice negotiations. The other side is accustomed to using "security" as a pretext to seek military bases all over the world, directly interfere in the internal affairs of various countries, and infringe upon the sovereignty of various countries. However, the internal affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will never allow the other side to interfere in any way; the sovereignty of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will not be allowed to be infringed upon in the slightest.
    At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, our representative continued to sternly refute the other side's absurd proposal of January 2nd. Our representative pointed out: The other side absurdly separates the release and repatriation of prisoners of war, violating all reason and convention. In fact, releasing without repatriation is tantamount to refusing to release all prisoners of war. Therefore, the other side places the release and repatriation of prisoners of war on a one-for-one exchange basis, the purpose of which is obviously to attempt to detain more than 160,000 of our captured personnel. The other side even more barbarously and shamelessly suggests exchanging civilians for prisoners of war on a one-for-one basis, openly using our captured personnel as hostages, which is intolerable! The other side's absurd suggestion to have the International Committee of the Red Cross identify whether prisoners of war and civilians are voluntarily repatriated is enough to prove that the other side is deliberately detaining prisoners of war and civilians and has no intention of resolving the fourth agenda item at all. Even the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war, which the other side itself has repeatedly cited, clearly stipulates that "after the cessation of hostilities, prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay." However, the other side openly refuses to accept this reasonable principle and puts forward a plan that is absolutely contrary to this principle. Our representative solemnly pointed out: The subcommittee on the fourth agenda item has been going on for twenty-five days. In order to prevent the meeting from being delayed any further, the other side should immediately abandon its absurd and untenable proposal, accept the reasonable principle of both sides quickly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war they hold, and immediately discuss how to specifically implement this principle.

    在第三第四两项议程小组委员会上
    我方继续严词驳斥美方荒谬建议
    【新华社开城四日电】四日朝鲜停战谈判的第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表痛斥对方假借“部队安全”的名义，坚持干涉我方内政的荒谬论点。我方代表指出：为了保证停战的稳定，我方建议双方保证在停战期间不自朝鲜境外进入任何军事人员、作战飞机、装甲车辆与武器弹药，但对方却一方面主张在停战期间自朝鲜境外无限制地输入军事人员与战争装备，另一方面又坚持限制朝鲜境内设备的修建。朝鲜境内设备的进行或不进行修建完全属于内政问题，根本就不允许在军事停战谈判会议中提出讨论。对方惯于假借“安全”之名，在全世界寻找军事基地，直接干涉各国的内政，侵犯各国的主权。但朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的内政将决不容许对方加以任何干涉；朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的主权将决不准许对方予以丝毫的侵犯。
    在第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表继续严词驳斥对方一月二日的荒谬提案。我方代表指出：对方将战俘的释放与遣送，违反一切理性与惯例，荒谬地分开。其实释而不遣，等于拒绝释放全体战俘。因此对方将战俘的释放与遣送放在一对一交换的基础上，其目的显然是企图扣留我方十六万余名被俘人员。对方更野蛮无耻地建议以平民在一对一的基础上与战俘互相交换，公然以我方被俘人员作为人质，是可忍孰不可忍？对方所提出的由红十字国际委员会来鉴定战俘与平民是否自愿遣返的荒谬建议，更足以证明对方蓄意扣留战俘和平民，根本无意解决第四项议程。即使对方自己所一再引用的日内瓦战俘公约，也明确规定“敌对行为终止后，战俘应即予释放与遣送，不得有所迟延。”而对方却公然拒绝接受这一合理的原则，提出了与这一原则所绝对抵触的方案。我方代表郑重指出：第四项议程的小组委员会已经进行了二十五天，为使会议不再拖延，对方应该立即放弃自己也无法辩护的荒谬无稽的提案，接受双方迅速释放与遣送其所收容的全体战俘的合理原则，并立即进行讨论如何具体实施此一原则的问题。
