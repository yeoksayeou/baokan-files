Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 11th: The Tianjin People's Court arrested profiteer Liu Zongshan on the 10th for resisting confession and sabotaging the anti-corruption and anti-bribery campaign. He will be severely punished according to the law. Liu Zongshan is the manager of the private Changchun Timber Firm. In the past, he repeatedly bribed Wang Jianfu, a cadre in the Construction Materials Section of the Municipal Public Property Management Bureau. Before and after the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he repeatedly used intimidation to prevent Wang Jianfu from confessing. However, under the enlightenment and assistance of leading cadres in the bureau, Wang Jianfu finally overcame his concerns and voluntarily confessed to his corrupt acts, and exposed the crimes of profiteer Liu Zongshan in bribing and sabotaging the confession and accusation movement.

In the autumn of 1949, Wang Jianfu purchased 40,000 feet of timber from Changchun Timber Firm. Afterwards, Liu Zongshan went to the Public Property Management Bureau to ask Wang Jianfu out for dinner, attempting to lure him to achieve his vile purpose, but was rejected by Wang. Seeing that Wang was unwilling to take the bait, Liu Zongshan, in the winter of the same year, took advantage of Wang's absence from home to pack 1.2 million yuan in a rush mat package and falsely told Wang's family that it was something brought to Wang Jianfu, in order to bribe Wang. When Wang discovered it and wanted to return it, Liu Zongshan lied to Wang, saying that it was a "commission" and that there was such a "rule" in business. Wang Jianfu finally succumbed to the profiteer's repeated temptations, abandoned the position of a revolutionary worker, and accepted the bribe. In 1950 and 1951, during several transactions between the Public Property Management Bureau and Changchun Timber Firm through Wang Jianfu, Liu Zongshan successively bribed Wang 3.5 million yuan.

Profiteer Liu Zongshan was afraid that Wang Jianfu would confess their crimes of bribery and accepting bribes, so he repeatedly intimidated Wang. He said to Wang: "The government's statement that lenient treatment will be given to those who are loyal and honest is 'false'. If you confess, you will definitely be sentenced to imprisonment. Who will support your family? I don't care, at most I will be fined a bit." This increased Wang's concerns, and he never dared to confess during the rectification study. After the citywide anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was launched at the end of last year, Wang Jianfu's thoughts underwent fierce struggle. On December 25th of last year, profiteer Liu Zongshan went to Wang Jianfu's home again, still using the old method to intimidate Wang Jianfu not to confess. Wang's ideological struggle became even more intense, and he still did not dare to confess. However, the leading cadres of the Public Property Management Bureau took the lead in conducting self-criticism and sincerely explained the government's policies, which greatly enlightened Wang Jianfu. Wang Jianfu's wife, brothers, and daughters also blamed him for not confessing and repenting. Wang Jianfu deeply felt that in such a large-scale movement, the only way out was to confess and repent, and finally overcame his concerns, confessing to the leading cadres of the bureau on the 7th of this month that he had accepted bribes, and exposed Liu Zongshan's crimes of repeatedly intimidating him and sabotaging the confession and accusation movement. At this time, Liu Zongshan still did not know that Wang had confessed, and even went to Wang's home again on the evening of January 9th, attempting to continue intimidating him and preventing Wang Jianfu from confessing. Because Wang avoided seeing him, Liu Zongshan took the opportunity to threaten Wang's wife. He said: If Wang Jianfu confesses and is sentenced to imprisonment, your whole family will have no way to survive. He instructed Wang's wife to persuade Wang "never to confess." The next day, Liu Zongshan fell into the net of justice.

    严惩破坏反贪污反行贿运动的分子
    天津市人民法院拘捕奸商刘宗珊
    【新华社天津十一日电】天津市人民法院已在十日将抗不坦白，破坏反贪污、反行贿运动的奸商刘宗珊拘捕，将依法予以严惩。刘宗珊是私营长春木行经理，过去曾多次向市公产管理局修建材料股干部王健甫行贿；在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开展的前后，又一再用威吓手段阻挠王健甫坦白。但王健甫在该局领导干部的启发帮助下，终于打破顾虑自动坦白了贪污行为，并检举了奸商刘宗珊行贿和破坏坦白、检举运动的罪行。
    王健甫在一九四九年秋天曾向长春木行购买四万尺木材。刘宗珊事后即到公产管理局找王健甫出去吃饭，企图进行引诱以达到他的丑恶目的，但被王拒绝。刘宗珊见王不肯上钩，就在同年冬天乘王不在家的时候，用蒲包装了一百二十万元，欺骗王家里的人说是给王健甫带来的东西，用以向王行贿。待王发现后要退还时，刘宗珊骗王说这是“佣钱”，买卖中有这种“规矩”。王健甫终于经不起奸商的一再引诱，失去革命工作人员的立场，接受了贿赂。在一九五○和一九五一两年内，公产管理局经王健甫和长春木行数次交易中，刘宗珊又先后向王行贿三百五十万元。
    奸商刘宗珊惟恐王健甫坦白出他们行贿、受贿的罪行，就一再对王威吓。他对王说：“政府说对忠诚坦白的人从宽处理是‘假’的，你要坦白了一定要判徒刑，家里人谁来养活？我倒没关系，顶多罚点款。”因此使王增加了顾虑，在整风学习中始终没敢坦白。去年年底全市展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动以后，王健甫的思想展开了激烈斗争。去年十二月二十五日，奸商刘宗珊又到王健甫的家里，仍用过去的办法威吓王健甫不要坦白。王的思想斗争更加激烈，仍未敢坦白交代。但是，公产管理局领导干部带头进行自我检讨，诚恳解释政府的政策，使王健甫深受启发。王健甫的妻子、兄弟、女儿也都责备他为什么还不坦白悔过。王健甫深深感到在这样大张旗鼓的运动中，只有坦白悔过才是唯一出路，终于打破顾虑，在本月七日向该局领导干部坦白了自己受贿的事情，并检举了刘宗珊屡次对他进行威吓破坏坦白检举运动的罪行。这时，刘宗珊还不知道王已坦白交代，竟在一月九日晚再一次到王家里，企图继续威吓，阻挠王健甫坦白。因王避而未见，刘宗珊就乘机威胁王妻。他说：如果王健甫坦白出来被处徒刑，你们全家大小就都没了活路，他嘱王的妻子劝王“千万不能坦白”。第二天，刘宗珊就落入了法网。
