An Outstanding Commander: Gao Jinghao

On a stormy night in Korea, Gao Jinghao, a young platoon leader of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, led his entire platoon in a surprise attack on the enemy camp, seizing the enemy's forward哨阵 ground, the 602.2 Height, at the northeast foot of Chigen Mountain. They built fortifications overnight and deployed the eighth and ninth squads on the left and right flanks. The seventh squad was stationed in front of the 602.2 Height on a featureless高地上, like a sharp knife thrust into the enemy. Before dawn, the enemy began to counterattack the seventh squad's position. Gao Jinghao commanded the soldiers of the seventh squad, launching a heroic blocking war. On the first day, they repelled five enemy attacks.

At night, during the lull in battle, the soldiers had not slept for four days and four nights. However, in order to meet the greater battle of the next day, under the leadership of Gao Jinghao, they finally overcame their fatigue and repaired the fortifications that had been destroyed by enemy artillery fire.

At dawn the next day, the enemy launched the sixth, seventh, and eighth attacks with a battalion of troops, but they were again repelled and rolled down the hillside in a panic. The 602.2 Height's position stood heroically in front of the enemy. At this time, five enemy planes were dispatched, coordinating with intense ground artillery fire, to bomb the seventh squad's position. Flames and thick smoke obscured the clear sky, and tons of steel poured down on the small hilltop. The enemy began to attack from three sides. Gao Jinghao encouraged the soldiers: "For the motherland, for the people of Korea, resolutely repel the enemy's attack!" The soldiers firmly replied to Gao Jinghao: "Platoon leader, don't worry, we must defend the position." The shelter was destroyed, Gao Jinghao and the soldiers of the seventh squad rolled into the trenches. When the trenches were leveled, they jumped into shell craters to continue fighting. Suddenly, an enemy platoon rushed up from behind Gao Jinghao. Resourceful and brave, Gao Jinghao held the trigger in one hand and picked up a grenade in the other, using his teeth to pull the fuse, firing six in a row, and the enemy rolled down the hillside again. At the same time, an enemy squad broke into the forward position. The situation was critical. Gao Jinghao quickly turned around and fired three shots in succession, killing three enemies, and the enemy fled in disarray again. He also ordered the ninth squad to quickly catch up and consolidate the position of the seventh squad.

Gao Jinghao and the seventh squad repelled nine enemy attacks in two days, killing and wounding 171 enemies, completing the blocking task. The seventh squad was awarded the title of Special Class Meritorious Squad, and Gao Jinghao was also awarded the glorious title of Special Class Meritorious Hero. (Attached picture)

    出色的指挥员高景灏
    在朝鲜一个风雨交加的夜里，中国人民志愿军某部的青年排长高景灏，率领全排战士偷袭敌营，抢占了赤根山东北脚下的敌人前哨阵地——六○二·二高地。他们连夜修筑好了工事，将八班、九班部署在左右两翼，第七班便扼守在六○二·二高地前面无标高地上，像是一把尖刀刺向敌人。天还没有亮，敌人开始向第七班阵地反扑了。高景灏指挥着第七班全班的战士，展开了英勇的阻击战，第一天中，便击退了敌人五次的进攻。
    夜里，是战斗的空隙，战士们已经四天四夜没有睡觉了。但是，他们为了迎接第二天更大的战斗，在高景灏的带动下，终于战胜了疲劳，修好了被敌人炮火所摧毁的工事。
    第二天拂晓，敌人又用一个营的兵力，发动了第六、第七、第八次攻击，结果又被击退，狼狈滚下了山坡。六○二·二高地的阵地始终英雄的屹立在敌人的面前。这时，五架敌机出动了，配合着地面上密集的炮火，向第七班的阵地进行轰击，火焰浓烟冲蔽晴空，成吨的钢铁往这座小山顶上倾泻。敌人开始从三面进攻了。高景灏激励着战士：“为了祖国，为了朝鲜的人民，坚决打退敌人的进攻。”战士们坚毅地回答高景灏：“排长，你放心，我们一定要坚守阵地。”掩蔽部被摧毁了，高景灏和第七班的战士便滚到交通沟里，交通沟被打平了，再跳到弹坑里继续抗击。突然，敌人一个排从高景灏的身后冲上来。机智英勇的高景灏，一手握着枪机，一手提起手榴弹，用牙齿拉出导火线，一连打出了六枚，敌人又滚下了山坡；同时，敌人一个班又突入了前沿阵地，形势危急了，高景灏迅速翻转身来，连发三枪，打死了三个敌人，敌人又狼狈的逃窜了。他并命令九班迅速赶上，巩固了七班的阵地。
    高景灏和第七班，两天中击退了敌人九次进攻，杀伤敌人一百七十一名，完成了阻击任务。第七班被奖为特等功臣班，高景灏也荣获了特等功臣的光荣称号。（附图片）
