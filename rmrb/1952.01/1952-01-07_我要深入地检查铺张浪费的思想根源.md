    I Want to Thoroughly Examine the Ideological Roots of Extravagance and Waste
    To the Editors: The Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan incident has taught me a lesson. This incident shows that people who are proud, complacent, and consider themselves meritorious easily become corrupted by bourgeois ideology. Only those who can maintain a style of hard work and simplicity, regularly engage in criticism and self-criticism, and diligently study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought can remain unaffected by bourgeois ideology.
    Since entering the city, many comrades have, to varying degrees, been tainted by some bourgeois ideological styles, and I am one of them. Take receiving office supplies as an example: regardless of whether the work requires it or not, I always want to receive more, which leads to waste. In this struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, I want to deeply examine the ideological roots of extravagance and waste.

    我要深入地检查铺张浪费的思想根源
    编辑同志：刘青山、张子善事件，给我上了一课。这一事件说明：骄傲自满、以功臣自居的人，就很容易被资产阶级思想所腐蚀。只有能够保持艰苦朴素作风，经常进行批评和自我批评，努力学习马克思、列宁主义和毛泽东思想的人，才能不受资产阶级思想的影响。
    进城以来，有很多同志多多少少地沾染了一些资产阶级的思想作风，我就是其中的一个。以领办公用具来说吧，我不管工作需要与否，总想多领一些，这就造成了浪费。在这次反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争中，我要深刻地检查铺张浪费的思想根源。苏文
