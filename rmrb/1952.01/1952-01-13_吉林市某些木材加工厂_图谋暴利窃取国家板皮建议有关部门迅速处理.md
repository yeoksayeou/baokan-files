    Certain Wood Processing Factories in Jilin City
    Plotting Exorbitant Profits by Stealing National Wood Offcuts: Recommendations for Relevant Departments to Address Swiftly
    To the Editor: The Jilin Provincial People's Government Commercial Department's Engineering Team, while investigating the wood processing situation for capital construction of state-owned specialized companies throughout the province last year, discovered that some wood processing factories engaged in illegal activities of stealing national timber.
    Last year, when various specialized companies in Jilin Province processed logs at various state-owned and private lumber mills in Jilin City, they only paid attention to the specifications and output rate of finished timber, but did not pay attention to the production rate of wood offcuts. Around August and September, when the Provincial Engineering Team processed at the state-owned Songjiang Lumber Mill, after investigation, they found that the wood offcut production rate of this factory greatly exceeded the production rate of various specialized companies processing at other lumber mills, and the specification timber yield rate was generally better than other processing plants. The Provincial Engineering Team immediately suggested that various specialized companies conduct inspections. The inspection results: when the Commercial Department Nursery processed logs at the private Zhongda Lumber Mill, each cubic meter of logs produced 118 jin of wood offcuts; when the Shuangyang Native Produce Company processed logs at the Gongda Lumber Mill, each cubic meter of logs only produced 55 jin of wood offcuts; when the Provincial Grain Company processed logs at the Provincial Match Factory, each cubic meter of logs only yielded 80 jin of wood offcuts. Later, after several negotiations between the responsible comrades of the company and the factory, they agreed to provide an additional 100 jin of wood offcuts per cubic meter of logs, but it still did not reach the quantity of 207 jin of wood offcuts produced per cubic meter at the Songjiang Lumber Mill. According to incomplete statistics, the value of wood offcuts stolen from the commercial system in Jilin Province during capital construction and wood processing is approximately over one hundred million yuan. Some processing factories, in order to steal more wood offcuts, even reduced the timber yield rate; some private processing factories, even resorted to despicable and shameful means to win over the factory's resident staff, stealing processed logs and produced wood offcuts.
    I suggest that the Jilin City Industry and Commerce Bureau and relevant departments promptly organize a major inspection, and severely punish lumber mills with serious acts of stealing national timber.  Xu Rongquan

    吉林市某些木材加工厂
    图谋暴利窃取国家板皮建议有关部门迅速处理
    编辑同志：吉林省人民政府商业厅工程队调查去年全省国营专业公司基本建设用的木材加工情况时，发现某些木材加工厂有盗窃国家木材的犯法行为。
    吉林省各专业公司去年在吉林市各公私营制材厂加工原木时，只注意成材的规格和出材率，对板皮的出产率却没有重视。到八、九月间，省工程队在公营淞江制材厂加工时，经过调查，发现这个工厂出产的板皮率大大地超出各专业公司在其他制材厂加工的出产率，而且规格成材率一般都比其他加工厂为好。省工程队马上建议各专业公司进行检查。检查结果：商业厅托儿所在私营中大制材厂加工原木时，每立方公尺原木出产板皮一百十八斤；双阳土产公司在公大制材厂加工原木时，每立方公尺原木只出产板皮五十五斤；省粮食公司在省营火柴厂加工原木时，每立方公尺原木也只给板皮八十斤，后经这个公司的负责同志和厂方数次交涉，才答应每立方公尺原木再多给一百斤板皮，但仍没有达到淞江制材厂的每立方公尺出板皮二百零七斤的数量。据不完全的统计：吉林省商业系统在基本建设加工木材中，被盗窃的板皮价值约在一亿元以上。有些加工厂，为了窃取更多的板皮，竟把出材率降低；有些私营加工厂，更以卑鄙可耻的手段，拉拢驻厂的工作人员，窃取加工的原木和出产的板皮。
    我建议吉林市工商局和有关部门迅速组织一次大检查，对有严重的盗窃国家木材行为的制材厂，要给以严厉的惩处。  徐荣权
