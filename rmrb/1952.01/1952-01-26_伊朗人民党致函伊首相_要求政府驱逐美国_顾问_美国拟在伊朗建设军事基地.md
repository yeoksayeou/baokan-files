Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: According to a Teheran dispatch from the Teletype Agency on the 23rd: The Central Committee of the Iranian People's Party, in an open letter to the Prime Minister, demanded the expulsion of all American "advisors" from the army and government departments, and the cessation of all negotiations with American imperialists and American-controlled institutions (such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, etc.). This letter was published in the Teheran newspaper "Bisui Ayandi Bao" on the 22nd. In this letter, the People's Party exposed the government's policy of compromising with the imperialists as the cause of the country's economic downturn. The open letter stated: "Foreign trade statistics show that the country spent millions of dollars buying useless and luxurious items from imperialist countries. Foreign trade is almost entirely monopolized by British and American colonialists. The interests of the people have never been considered." The open letter from the Central Committee of the People's Party to the Prime Minister finally called on the government to take swift action to conclude agreements with any patrons who respect Iranian sovereignty on the issue of selling Iranian oil.

Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: According to a dispatch from the Teletype Agency correspondent in Washington: The United States Department of Defense has approved the suggestion of Colonel McLand, an American military expert stationed in Iran, that military bases and military equipment be constructed along the Iranian coast of the Persian Gulf. This decision was made after the United States Department of Defense recently studied McLand's report. In his report, McLand described in detail the important areas along the Persian Gulf coast: Bushehr, Bengeriger, Bender Abbas, Chah Bahar, and other ports. He believes that these ports can easily be made suitable for the needs of the United States Navy and Air Force. McLand's report paid particular attention to the strategic significance of Qeshm Island. He believes that this island, located between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, is the "ideal place" for building the second largest U.S. Air Force base in the Middle East and the Arabian Sea region. The largest air force base is the Dhahran base in Saudi Arabia, opposite the Bahrain Islands.

    伊朗人民党致函伊首相
    要求政府驱逐美国“顾问”
    美国拟在伊朗建设军事基地
    【新华社二十五日讯】据电通社德黑兰二十三日讯：伊朗人民党中央委员会在致首相的一封公开信中，要求驱逐军队和政府各部门中的所有美国“顾问”，并停止和美国帝国主义者及美国控制下的机构（如国际复兴开发银行等）进行的一切谈判。这封信是在二十二日的德黑兰报纸“比苏·阿杨第报”上刊载的。人民党在这封信中揭发了政府和帝国主义者妥协的政策是国家经济不景气的原因。公开信说：“对外贸易统计显示：国家花了千百万美元从帝国主义国家购买了一些无用的和奢侈的物品。对外贸易几乎全部被英美殖民者垄断了。人民的利益从来没有被考虑过。”人民党中央委员会致首相的公开信最后要求政府迅速采取行动，就销售伊朗石油问题和尊重伊朗主权的任何主顾缔结协定。
    【新华社二十五日讯】据电通社记者自华盛顿报道：美国国防部批准了美国驻伊朗的军事专家麦克兰德上校的建议，他建议沿波斯湾伊朗海岸建设军事基地和军事设备。这一决定是美国国防部最近研究麦克兰德的报告后采取的。麦克兰德在报告中详细描述了波斯湾沿岸的重要地区：布什尔、本盖林格、本得阿巴斯、查斯克等港口。他认为，这些港口很容易弄成适合美国海军和空军的需要。麦克兰德的报告特别注意奇什木岛的战略意义。他认为，这个介于波斯湾和阿曼湾之间的岛屿，是建设美国在中东和阿拉伯海地区的第二大空军基地的“理想地方”。第一大空军基地是巴林群岛对面沙特阿拉伯的达赫兰基地。
