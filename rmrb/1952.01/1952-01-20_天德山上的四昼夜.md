Editor's note by Zhong Dejie, Lin Ying, Yang Yingfang, Sun Yaquan, and Ren Ying of a Volunteer Army Unit: The Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army defending Tiande Mountain has been awarded the glorious title of "Heroic Company of Tiande Mountain." Recently, they sent Comrade Yan Chengen as a representative to participate in the Volunteer Army's delegation returning to the motherland. Here is a brief introduction to their heroic deeds in the Battle of Tiande Mountain.

	On the morning of National Day, the warriors of the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army guarding Tiande Mountain excitedly pasted a brand-new couplet at the entrance of their fortifications. Soldiers came and went, reciting the generous and heroic words: "Strive to create a heroic squad; we won't leave the mountain until we become heroes."

	From this National Day onward, the warriors created a brilliant victory on Tiande Mountain.

	On the morning of October 1st, the enemy continuously bombarded Tiande Mountain with dozens of heavy artillery pieces. The heroes knew that a fierce battle was about to begin! Victory was about to arrive! They excitedly shouted to each other:

	"This year's National Day is really meaningful!" "Strive to kill more American devils and send a gift to the motherland!" Before the battle even started, a wave of challenges was already rising on the position. Many people shouted the solemn oath at the entrance of the fortifications again and again.

	At 12:00 noon, two platoons of the enemy, under the cover of twelve aircraft and twenty-five tanks, first charged towards the Third Platoon defending the front lines. Squad Leader Shang Yuzhi shouted: "Comrades! Prepare your weapons! 'Receive' all the 'gifts' sent by Truman!" "Okay!" the comrades answered excitedly, calmly unscrewing the caps of their grenades.

	Under the muzzles of their officers' guns, the devils slowly climbed up the mountain. The soldiers waited calmly in the fortifications. Seeing that they were only forty or fifty meters away from the position, with Shang Yuzhi's first grenade, everyone threw their grenades together, followed by several rows of dense bullets. The enemy fell in piles before they could even fire a shot. The enemies who crawled like maggots fled down the mountain like rabbits.

	After the first failed assault, the enemy launched two more consecutive assaults. The heroes of the Fifth Company lay in the smoke and dust raised by artillery shells and bombs, calmly and stubbornly fighting the enemy. Li Wanfa's first grenade killed three devils. He turned around and told the squad leader: "Now, Chairman Mao is reviewing the masses in Tiananmen Square. I am here inspecting the gifts sent by the devils on behalf of Chairman Mao!" He kept throwing grenades outwards. The area thirty meters away was always filled with dark smoke and the miserable screams of the devils. Seeing that the devils were coming again, Third Platoon Leader Liu Xuewu immediately jumped out of the fortifications and swept fiercely with his machine gun, killing more than forty enemies in one breath. "For the motherland! Kill!" This slogan encouraged the warriors to jump out of the fortifications one by one, throwing grenades, bullets, anti-tank mines, demolition tubes... all at the enemy. Encouraged by the victory of the infantry comrades, the artillerymen fiercely bombarded the enemy with mortars. When the gun mount was damaged, they used their arms to support it. Communist Party member Yin Zhongjie held the red-hot gun barrel in his arms, loaded shells with one hand, and fired thirty rounds in one breath. Seeing that the Third Platoon Leader of the Fifth Company suddenly fell, artilleryman Xie Congen ran over, picked up the machine gun, and continued to sweep the enemy. A fierce battle ended, and the enemy left corpses all over the mountain. The remaining enemies fled in defeat with miserable cries.

	On the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, the battle continued, and the warriors' determination to "not leave the mountain until we become heroes" became even firmer in the battle. Company Commander Yang Baoshan constantly encouraged the comrades: "Defending Tiande Mountain is defending the gate of our motherland. The people of the motherland and the world are waiting to celebrate our victory! We must not let the people of the motherland down!" The soldiers took advantage of the lulls in the fighting to constantly write letters of determination and send them to the company commander. "As long as one person is here, Tiande Mountain is an impregnable wall of bronze." This sentence is correct. Whenever the enemy recklessly attacked the position, the warriors held their ground. After Squad Leader Shang Yuzhi led the comrades of the Eighth Squad to repel five enemy assaults, the position was piled with more than forty enemy corpses. The fortifications were destroyed by enemy artillery fire, but they flexibly shifted their positions to the shell craters and continued to fight the enemy. Wang Xingfu fired with two submachine guns alone, and Youth League member Wang Keqin bravely threw back the smoking grenades thrown by the enemy, killing and wounding them. Shang Yuzhi held a light machine gun, firing at the enemy coming from all directions. Seeing that Shang Yuzhi's head was bleeding, Wang Xingfu took his gun and said, "Squad Leader! You're wounded, go down! Leave the position to me! I guarantee there won't be any problems." "It doesn't matter if my head is injured! Killing the enemy is the most important thing!" Later, when the bullets ran out, Shang Yuzhi jumped out of the trench and swung his rifle butt at the enemy, killing one enemy, and at the same time gloriously fell. Youth League member Wu Zuozhong had one eye blinded and one ear blown off. In order to realize his determination, he bravely jumped out of the fortifications and wrestled with the enemy. He tightly hugged the enemy's waist and bit the enemy's ear fiercely. When he perished together with the enemy under the artillery fire, he was still biting the dead enemy. The immortal hero Zhang Zuomei killed twenty-seven American devils before being seriously wounded. When the enemy rushed in front of him, he suddenly turned over, pressed the enemy to the ground, strangled the enemy with force, and also died heroically. After his death, he was still tightly grasping the enemy's hair.

	After four days of fierce fighting on Tiande Mountain, the enemy paid the price of more than nine hundred lives but failed to occupy this heroic land. Finally, the enemy used even more despicable means. They continuously fired more than twenty gas bombs at Tiande Mountain. Taking advantage of the opportunity when some comrades were knocked unconscious, the enemy rushed over. At this time, the comrades who were less poisoned immediately blocked their mouths and noses with diapers, and finally used their remaining grenades and stones to beat the enemy back.

    天德山上的四昼夜
    志愿军某部　钟德杰、林影、杨英芳、孙亚泉、任影编者按：守备天德山的志愿军某部第五连已获得“天德山英雄连”的光荣称号。最近他们派了代表阎成恩同志参加志愿军归国代表团回到祖国。这里简单地介绍他们在天德山战斗中的英勇事迹。
    国庆节的早晨，守卫在天德山的志愿军某部五连的勇士们，兴奋地把一副崭新的对联，贴在工事的门口。战士们来来往往朗诵着“争取创造英雄班，不当英雄不下山”这两句慷慨的豪语。
    就从国庆节的这一天起，勇士们在天德山上，创下了光辉的胜利。
    十月一日的早晨，敌人用数十门重炮不断地向天德山轰击，英雄们知道：一场激烈的战斗将要开始了！胜利又将要到来了！他们高兴地互相嚷着说：
    “今年的国庆节过得真有意义啊！”“争取多杀几个美国鬼子，给祖国送份礼！”战斗还没有开始，阵地上挑战的热潮已经掀起来了。很多人一次又一次地喊出工事门口的两句庄严的誓言。
    上午十二点钟的时候，两个排的敌人，在十二架飞机、二十五辆坦克的掩护下，首先向守在前沿的三排冲过来，八班副尚玉芝喊道：“同志们！准备好家伙！把杜鲁门送来的‘礼物’全部‘收下’来！”“好啊！”同志们在兴奋地回答，从容地把手榴弹盖拧开。
    鬼子们在他们军官的枪口下，缓慢地向山上爬行，战士们在工事里沉着地等待着。眼看离阵地只有四、五十公尺了，随着尚玉芝的第一枚手榴弹，大家把手榴弹一齐打过去，紧随着就是几排密集的子弹，敌人来不及打枪就成堆地倒下去。像蛆虫一样爬过来的敌人，却又像兔子一样地向山下逃去了。
    敌人继第一次冲锋失败之后，又连续发动了两次冲锋。五连的英雄们，卧在炮弹、炸弹所炸起的烟尘里，沉着顽强地打击着敌人。李万发的第一颗手溜弹便炸死了三个鬼子，他回头告诉班长说：“现在，毛主席正在天安门检阅群众队伍，我在这里替毛主席检阅鬼子送来的礼物啊！”他把手榴弹不住地向外打，三十公尺以外的地方，始终弥漫了乌黑的烟尘和鬼子们的惨声怪叫。三排长刘学武看见鬼子们又来了，立刻跳出工事端着机枪猛扫，一气就打死了四十多个敌人。“为了祖国！杀呀！”这一声口号，鼓舞着勇士们一个个跳出了工事，把手榴弹、子弹、反坦克雷、爆破筒……一齐向敌人打去。为步兵同志的胜利而鼓舞的炮兵们，用迫击炮向着敌人猛打。炮架打坏了，就用胳膊支着打。共产党员尹忠杰用胳膊抱着打红了的炮筒，一手装炮弹，一气打了三十多发。炮手谢从恩看见五连三排长突然倒下去，跑过去拾起机枪就继续扫射敌人。一场激烈的战斗结束了，敌人丢下满山的尸体。剩下的敌人，带着惨叫溃败下去。
    二日、三日、四日，战斗依然持续着，战士们“不当英雄不下山”的决心在战斗中也越发坚定了。连长杨宝山不断地鼓励着同志们：“守住天德山，就是守住我们祖国的大门。祖国和全世界的人民都在等着庆祝我们的胜利哪！我们决不能给祖国人民丢脸！”战士们利用战斗空隙，不断地写决心书送到连长那里。“只要有一个人在这里，天德山就是一道铜墙铁壁。”这句话是对的。每当敌人不知死活地向阵地进犯时，勇士们都坚守住了自己的阵地。八班副尚玉芝率领着八班的同志们打退了敌人的五次冲锋后，阵地上堆满了四十多具敌尸。工事被敌人炮火打毁，可是他们就灵活地转战在炮弹坑内继续打击敌人。王兴福一个人用两支冲锋枪打，青年团员王克勤勇敢地把敌人扔过来的正在冒烟的手榴弹扔回去杀伤敌人。尚玉芝抱着一挺轻机枪，向四周来的敌人射击。王兴福看见尚玉芝的头部流了血，就去接他的枪说：“副班长！你负伤了，下去吧！阵地交给我！保证没问题。”“头负伤了不要紧！杀敌人要紧！”后来，子弹打光了，尚玉芝跳出交通沟，轮起枪托向敌人打去，打死一个敌人，同时他自己也光荣地倒下去。青年团员吴作忠的一个眼睛被打瞎了，耳朵被打掉了，为着要实现他的决心，他勇猛地跳出工事，和敌人扭打起来。他紧紧地抱着敌人的腰，狠狠地用嘴咬住敌人的耳朵，当他在炮火下与敌人同归于尽时，他还咬着已死的敌人。不朽的英雄张祚美在打死了二十七个美国鬼子之后，他负了重伤，当敌人冲到他跟前时，他猛然翻起来把敌人按倒在地上，用劲把敌人扼死，自己也壮烈牺牲。死后他还紧紧抓着敌人的头发。
    天德山进行了四天的激烈战斗，敌人付出了九百多条性命的代价，未能占领这块英雄的土地。最后，敌人把更卑劣的手段施出来了，它们连续向天德山打了二十余发毒气弹，趁着有的同志被昏倒的时机，敌人又冲过来，这时中毒较轻的同志，便马上用尿布堵住自己的口鼻，最后用仅余的手榴弹和石头把敌人打下去了。
