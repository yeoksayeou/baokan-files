    Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce Holds Successive Emergency Meetings
    Calling on Industrialists and Businessmen to Swiftly Confess and Expose Illegal Activities; Those Who Fail to Turn Over a New Leaf Will Be Punished by National Law
    [Reported by this newspaper] After the Beijing Municipal Committee for the Inspection of Economy and Austerity accepted the request of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce (hereinafter referred to as the Federation of Industry and Commerce) and decided to suspend the inspection of the industrial and commercial circles for three days, the Federation of Industry and Commerce yesterday successively held emergency meetings of the directors of various industry associations in the city and the persons in charge of the Federation of Industry and Commerce's district offices, as well as a temporary executive committee meeting of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The Federation of Industry and Commerce also hosted a general membership meeting of the construction industry.
    At these meetings, Fu Huating, Chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, called on all industrialists and businessmen in the city to seize this opportunity to quickly and thoroughly confess and expose all illegal activities such as bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, and theft of state economic intelligence. He warned that if anyone still refuses to confess and is unwilling to turn over a new leaf, they will ultimately be punished by national law like Liu Yuanjing and others.
    Chairman Fu Huating emphasized in his speech that during this great city-wide movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the Municipal People's Government has repeatedly given the industrial and commercial circles opportunities to reform, postponing inspections of the industrial and commercial circles several times, which can truly be described as the utmost benevolence and righteousness. Although some industrialists and businessmen have honestly confessed their criminal acts since the start of the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in the industrial and commercial circles, especially after the arrest and prosecution of unscrupulous merchants like Liu Yuanjing and others, the industrial and commercial circles have generally attached importance to the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement, and the number of confessions has rapidly increased. The content of confessions has deepened from rebates, treating guests, and giving gifts to stealing state property and tax evasion. However, many people still remain deluded, waiting and watching, unwilling to confess, or downplaying serious offenses, or only talking about bribery without mentioning the illegal benefits obtained after bribery. These thoughts and behaviors are extremely wrong. If these people do not wake up suddenly, they will eventually suffer the consequences of their actions. Chairman Fu Huating repeatedly advised all industrialists and businessmen in the city: The many facts of the three years since the liberation of Beijing have proven that the People's Government always does what it says. This anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement must be carried through to the end. The People's Government has already mastered a large amount of material related to bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property in the industrial and commercial circles, and has transferred a large number of cadres to prepare for a comprehensive inspection of the industrial and commercial circles. Therefore, all industrialists and businessmen in the city should quickly and honestly confess all their problems. It is impossible for anyone to get away with it.
    At the general membership meeting of the construction industry, Chairman Fu Huating said: We have talked countless times about why we oppose corruption and bribery, and everyone already understands. Therefore, today's problem is very simple: either reform and thoroughly confess, or refuse to confess and embark on the road to destruction. After his speech, Ye Yuan, acting chairman of the construction industry association and manager of Jingsheng Construction Factory, Huang Zhonglin, manager of Kangning Construction Factory, Liu Yuping, manager of Luan Construction Factory, Meng Zhaobo, manager of Jianhua Construction Factory, Zhou Jichang, manager of Xieshun Construction Factory, and Zhao Dianchen, manager of Jieji Jianguo Construction Factory, took the lead in confessing their illegal activities such as bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property, and explained in detail their painful ideological struggles. Some even confessed to the despicable acts of forming "alliances of offense and defense" with bribed cadres. Huang Zhonglin, manager of Kangning Construction Factory, alone bribed cadres with 50 million yuan in one instance. Meng Zhaobo, manager of Jianhua Construction Factory, stole 60 million yuan of state property in one instance by using inflated prices.
    After the meeting, various industry associations and the Federation of Industry and Commerce's district offices mostly held various types of meetings. Some industries that considered themselves to have no problems, or industrial and commercial households who had consistently refused to confess, also confessed and supplemented their criminal facts. However, according to the report from the Federation of Industry and Commerce last night, some industries and industrial and commercial households still do not attach enough importance to the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement. For example, the match, cigarette, and wood industries have had no significant activities in the past two days; when the machine iron industry and others held meetings yesterday, the members of the association still could not all be present; many illegal industrialists and businessmen have not confessed thoroughly, or have not confessed at all. One of the main reasons is that some of the directors and members of the industry associations themselves have illegal activities, and therefore adopt a negative and perfunctory attitude towards the movement. For example, some members of the machine iron industry were hesitant and vague when confessing their problems; some members of the hardware industry association were not very enthusiastic; even some members of the trade industry were not satisfied with the confession of a certain person in charge of the industry association. Those heads of industry associations who have committed bribery and other illegal activities should learn from the experience of Liu Yuanjing and others, recognize that there are not many opportunities left to confess voluntarily; if they do not make a firm decision at this time, they will regret it too late.

    北京市工商联连续召开紧急会议
    号召工商业者迅速坦白检举不法行为如不翻然改过自新必将受到国法制裁
    【本报讯】在北京市节约检查委员会接受北京市工商业联合会（以下简称工商联）的请求，决定对工商界的检查暂停三天以后，工商联在昨天连续召开了全市各行业公会主任委员、工商联各区办事处负责人的紧急会议和工商联临时执行委员会议。并由工商联主持召开了营造业全体会员大会。
    在这些会议上，工商联主任委员傅华亭号召全市工商业者抓紧这一机会，迅速彻底地坦白检举一切行贿、偷税、盗骗国家资财和盗窃国家经济情报等不法行为；如果有人仍然拒不坦白，不愿改过自新，最后一定会像刘元敬等一样受到国家法律的制裁。
    傅华亭主任委员在讲话中特别强调地指出，在这次全市的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大运动中，市人民政府已经一再给了工商界以改过自新的机会，几次延缓对工商界的检查，真正可以说是仁至义尽了。虽然在工商界的反贪污反行贿运动开始后，有些工商业者已经老老实实地坦白了自己的犯罪行为，特别是自奸商刘元敬等人被逮捕法办以后，工商界已经普遍重视了反贪污反行贿运动，坦白的材料已迅速增多，坦白的内容已由回扣、请客、送礼等深入到盗骗国家资财和偷漏税等方面。但是，仍然有许多人执迷不悟，观望等待，不肯坦白，或避重就轻，或只谈行贿，而不谈行贿后所取得的非法利益。这些思想和行为都是极端错误的。这些人如不猛然醒悟，最后必将自食其恶果。傅华亭主任委员一再劝告全市工商业者说：北京解放三年来的许多事实已经证明，人民政府一向是说到就要做到的。这次的反贪污反行贿运动一定要坚持到底。现在人民政府已经掌握了大批有关工商界行贿、偷税和盗骗国家资财等的材料，而且已经抽调了大批干部，准备全面展开对工商界的检查。因此全市工商业者应该赶快老老实实地把自己的问题全部交代清楚，任何人想要混过去都是不可能的。
    在营造业全体会员大会上，傅华亭主任委员说：为什么要反贪污反行贿，我们已经讲了无数次，大家也都已经懂得了。因此今天的问题很简单，要不就是改过自新，彻底坦白；要不就是拒不坦白，走上毁灭的道路。他讲话以后，营造业公会代理主任委员、敬胜营造厂经理叶辕、康宁营造厂经理黄钟麟、陆安营造厂经理刘玉璞、建华营造厂经理孟昭伯、协顺营造厂经理周继昌和杰记建国营造厂经理赵殿臣相继带头坦白了本身行贿、偷税、盗骗国家资财等不法行为，并详细地说明了自己痛苦的思想斗争经过。有的人还坦白了怎样和受贿干部订立“攻守同盟”等卑鄙行为。仅康宁营造厂经理黄钟麟一次便向干部行贿五千万元。建华营造厂经理孟昭伯，一次用高估价格的手段就盗骗了国家资财六千万元。
    会后，各行业公会和工商联各区办事处大都召开了各种不同类型的会议。有些自认为没有问题的行业，或者始终拒不坦白的工商户，也都坦白和补充了犯罪事实。但根据昨晚工商联的汇报来看，仍然有一些行业和工商户对反贪污反行贿运动不够重视。如火柴、卷烟、木器等业近两日没有什么显著的活动；机器铁工业等昨日召开会议时，公会的委员仍然不能到齐；许多不法工商业者坦白交代的还很不彻底，或根本不坦白。主要的原因之一是有些行业公会的主任委员和委员本身有不法行为，因而对运动采取了消极应付的错误态度。如机器铁工业的有些委员，在交代问题时吞吞吐吐，很不具体；五金业公会有些委员的积极性很差；甚至贸易业有些会员对该业公会某负责人的坦白也不满意。这些有行贿等不法行为的行业公会的负责人应该从刘元敬等人身上得到教训，认清自动坦白的机会已经不多；如果这时再不痛下决心，将来就会后悔莫及。
