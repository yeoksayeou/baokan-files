Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, January 11th: The Wuhan business community held a mobilization meeting against bribery and deception on the 10th. Over 600 people attended, including directors and representatives from various industries and representatives from state-owned specialized companies. Mayor Wu Defeng and Deputy Mayor Chen Jingshe were invited to speak at the meeting. They called on businesspeople throughout the city to take immediate action and launch a campaign against bribery, fraud, tax evasion, and theft. They were to expose and confess illegal activities within the business community that stole state property, harmed the interests of the people, and corrupted revolutionary cadres. They were also to denounce those involved in embezzlement, bribery, and accepting bribes, and carry out self-reform within this movement. Wu Defeng said: "Those who have engaged in bribery and fraud can have their serious crimes reduced and minor crimes mitigated or exempted after confessing. If they do not confess, they will not only be fined but also punished according to the law." He called on businesspeople throughout the city to resolutely discard and wash away the dark and decadent side of the national bourgeoisie, play a positive and progressive role, and establish new morals. He Hengfu, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, then spoke. He said, "Today is the first day of self-reform for our city's business community. We must bravely 'take a bath' to save ourselves and save others."

At the meeting, Wu Chuanqi, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and Deputy Manager of Qunye Company, first confessed his behavior of seeking exorbitant profits and deceiving the tax bureau. Xu Xuexuan, Chairman of the Silk and Cloth Industry Association, confessed bribery on behalf of Wang Ganting, manager of Huiji Xing Cotton Cloth Store, and reported the embezzlement of Zeng Zhaoyin, head of the business section of the Minquan Road office of the Wuhan Branch of the People's Bank of China. Businesspeople present at the meeting also requested to confess and report others. Jiang Xinmin, business manager of Laolian Binding Society, confessed the details of his illegal activities, including repeatedly stealing state-processed raw materials, creating false accounts to evade taxes, and defrauding and enticing government cadres.

Each industry throughout the city will establish special agencies and divide into groups after the meeting to launch a confession and denunciation movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 11th: To further mobilize the business community to participate in the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement, the Xi'an Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce convened an expanded cadre meeting on the 9th. More than 2,500 people attended, including members of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, members of the Industry and Commerce Branch of the Municipal Economy Drive Inspection Committee, members of various industry associations, and heads of various industry denunciation groups. Mayor Fang Zhongru was invited to make a mobilization report.

Since the Xi'an business community launched the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and denunciation of corruption movement, various industries have confessed and exposed many cases. In the four days from the 5th to the 8th alone, more than 1,200 facts of bribery, tax evasion, and corruption were exposed. However, this movement is not yet widespread and in-depth in the business community, and many businesspeople are still standing outside the movement. Some businesspeople still have some concerns in their minds, avoiding important issues and talking about distant matters rather than current ones. Some are protecting each other and agreeing on a "defense alliance." Fang Zhongru first criticized various incorrect understandings in his report. He said: "Some people think that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is the government's business and has nothing to do with them. This is wrong. For industry and commerce to develop normally, bribery must be completely eliminated." As for some merchants who are afraid of getting into trouble or offending people, this is even more unnecessary. The People's Government will absolutely support those who report violations. Fang Zhongru emphasized the policy of the People's Government in his report. He said: "We welcome businesspeople who have engaged in bribery and tax evasion to make a clean breast of it at once; confess as much as you have immediately, confess more as you remember more later, but absolutely do not allow deliberate delays. If there is tax evasion, only the tax needs to be made up if it is voluntarily confessed. If it is not confessed and is exposed, not only will the tax be made up, but the punishment will be heavier. Other acts of colluding to steal state property will also be handled according to this principle." Fang Zhongru emphasized: "Individual merchants with problems have a侥幸[jiaoxing - lucky] mentality and want to hide the truth or burn their books. This is a criminal act and will be punished by law. Those who obstruct cadres from confessing and suppress shop assistants and apprentices from reporting will also be severely punished."

Pan Yuanquan, Deputy Director of the Xi'an Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, called on all members and group leaders in his speech to take the lead in fighting corruption and bribery and completely change the bad habits brought by the business community from the old society.

[This Newspaper News] According to a Xinhua News Agency report: Shop assistants, apprentices, and ordinary residents throughout Xi'an have been widely mobilized to participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. In the past six or seven days, more than 1,700 cases of corruption, bribery, tax evasion, and other cases have been reported by the people, which has powerfully promoted the development of the movement in government agencies and the business community.

Twelve districts in Xi'an have established Economy Drive Inspection Committees, and mass denunciation groups of five to seven people have been established in streets, industries, and rural areas in the suburbs. According to statistics from five districts, there are more than 340 such denunciation groups, with more than 2,000 members. Some denunciation groups have formulated covenants to ensure that they are not used by corrupt elements and are not afraid of threats from corrupt elements, and that they will seriously contact the masses to collect materials. In order to widely educate the citizens, the city held a mass mobilization meeting, and each district held various types of mass meetings. The Seventh District also held a general meeting of residential courtyards. Some districts used blackboards and widely publicized through reading groups and winter schools, some streets set up secret reporting boxes, and each district is generally establishing mass reception stations. Through these many forms of publicity and organization mobilization, the people of the city have now formed a force against corruption, waste, and bribery.

    武汉和西安两市工商界进行动员
    坦白检举行贿和偷税漏税行为
    【新华社汉口十一日电】武汉市工商界在十日举行反行贿、反欺骗动员大会。到会的有各行业主任委员、代表和各国营专业公司代表共六百多人。市长吴德峰、副市长陈经畲应邀到会讲话。他们号召全市工商业者立即行动起来，展开反行贿、反欺诈、反偷漏、反盗窃的运动，揭发和坦白工商界中盗窃国家财产、违害人民利益、腐蚀革命干部的违法行为，检举贪污、行贿、受贿分子，并在这个运动中进行自我改造。吴德峰说：凡有行贿、欺诈行为的，坦白后重罪可以减轻，轻罪可以减免。如果不坦白，不仅要课以罚款，还要依法制裁。他号召全市工商业者坚决丢弃和洗刷民族资产阶级黑暗腐朽的一面，发挥积极的进步的作用，树立新的道德。市工商业联合会筹备会主任委员贺衡夫接着讲话。他说：“今天是我们全市工商界进行自我改造的第一天，要勇敢地‘下水洗澡’，挽救自己，挽救别人。”
    会上，市工商业联合会筹备会秘书长、群业公司副经理吴传启首先坦白了他贪图暴利、欺瞒税务局的行为。绸布业同业公会主任委员徐雪轩代替晦记兴棉布店经理王干庭坦白了行贿行为和检举了中国人民银行武汉市分行民权路办事处业务股长曾昭银的贪污行为。到会的工商业者也纷纷要求坦白和检举别人。劳联装订社业务经理姜新民坦白了他屡次偷窃国家加工原料、造假账偷漏税款、欺诈和引诱人民政府干部等违法行为的经过。
    全市各行业在会后即将建立专门机构，划分小组，展开坦白和检举运动。
    【新华社西安十一日电】为进一步动员工商界参加反行贿、反偷税漏税运动，西安市工商业联合会在九日召开扩大干部会议。到会的有市工商业联合会委员、市节约检查委员会工商业联合会分会委员、各行业公会委员和各行业检举小组的组长等共二千五百多人。市长方仲如应邀作动员报告。
    西安市工商界展开反行贿、反偷税漏税、检举贪污运动以来，各行业已坦白和检举出不少案件，仅五日至八日的四天中，即暴露出一千二百多件行贿、漏税、贪污事实。但是这个运动在工商界还不够普遍深入，还有不少工商业者站在运动之外。有些工商业者思想中仍存在着一些顾虑，谈问题避重就轻，谈远的不谈现在的。有的互相包庇，协议
    “攻守同盟”。方仲如在报告中首先批判了各种不正确的认识。他说：有些人认为反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义是政府的事，和自己无关。这是不对的。工商业要获得正常发展，必须彻底消灭贪污、行贿行为。至于某些商人怕惹事，怕得罪人，更是不必要的。人民政府绝对给检举者撑腰。方仲如在报告中着重解释了人民政府的政策。他说：欢迎有行贿、漏税行为的工商业者一次交代清楚；有多少马上交代多少，陆续想起陆续交代，但绝不容许故意拖延。有漏税行为的如果自动坦白，只补税就行了。如果拒不交代被检举出来后，不仅要补税，而且要加重处罚。对于其他勾结盗窃国家财产的行为也依照这个原则办理。方仲如强调指出：个别有问题的商人存在侥幸心理，想隐瞒不报或者烧掉账簿。这是犯罪行为，一定要受到法律制裁。对于那些阻挠干部坦白和压制店员学徒检举者，也一定要予以严厉惩处。
    西安市工商业联合会副主任委员潘源泉在讲话中号召全体委员和组长带头和贪污行贿的行为作斗争，彻底改变工商界从旧社会带来的恶习。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：西安全市店员、学徒和一般居民已广泛动员起来，参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。最近六、七天由人民群众检举出来的贪污、行贿、漏税等案件已有一千七百多件，有力地推动了运动在机关和工商界中的开展。
    西安市十二个区都成立了节约检查委员会，街道、行业和市郊农村都普遍成立五人到七人的群众检举小组。据五个区的统计，这种检举小组共有三百四十多个，组员达二千多人。有些检举小组制订了公约，保证不受贪污分子利用，不怕贪污分子威胁，要认真联系群众搜集材料。为了广泛地向市民群众进行教育，全市曾召开群众动员大会，各区都分别举行过各种性质的群众会。第七区并普遍举行了居民院落会。有些区利用黑板报和通过读报组、冬学广泛进行宣传，有些街道设立密告箱，各区正在普遍成立群众接待站。通过这许多形式的宣传和组织动员，全市人民群众现已结成一股反贪污、反浪费、反行贿的力量。
