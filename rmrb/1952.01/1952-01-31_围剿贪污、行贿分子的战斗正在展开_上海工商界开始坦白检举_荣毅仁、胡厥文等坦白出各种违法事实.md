(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) According to Xinhua News Agency: The battle to encircle and suppress embezzlers is unfolding in Shanghai, with people from all walks of life mobilized. Under the impetus of various forces, the industrial and commercial sectors have also begun to launch confession and denunciation movements.

Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of the city have begun to take active steps to participate in the movement. Two hundred thousand shop employees across the city stand at the forefront of the struggle, actively exposing the criminal behavior of illegal merchants. In a very short period, the vast number of shop employees reported four thousand cases of illegal acts by illegal merchants, such as bribery, fraud, and tax evasion. Many members of the Communist Youth League and housewives have also begun to report corrupt and law-breaking relatives, just as they did in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries.

Under the impetus of various forces, the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai have also begun to launch a confession and denunciation movement. From January 19th to 26th, the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce held various meetings, and many representatives and industry leaders in the industrial and commercial circles took the lead in reviewing or confessing at different meetings. For example, Rong Yiren, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and General Manager of the Shenxin Textile Company, confessed to the fact that he caused significant losses to state funds due to delayed delivery to state-owned enterprises. Rong Yiren sold 1,000 bales of cotton yarn to the Shanghai Municipal Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company (renamed China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company East China District Company in March of the following year) in December 1949, which was not repaid until the autumn of 1951. The Fuxin Flour Mill, operated by Rong Yiren, also lost more than 110,000 bags of flour during state processing in 1949, which was not paid until June 1951. Both of these delayed the use of huge state funds for a long time. Hu Juewen, Chairman of the Supervisory Committee, confessed to the crime of leaking state economic secrets. In May 1950, while attending a meeting in Beijing, he sent letters and telegrams to his enterprises in Shanghai, informing them of the government's upcoming large machine orders, which caused a huge surge in hardware and equipment prices in Shanghai. Other main leaders of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, such as Liu Hongsheng, also confessed to concealing foreign exchange deposits and off-book assets. Furthermore, at the joint meeting of the members of the Executive and Supervisory Committee and the Anti-Bribery, Anti-Fraud, Anti-Profiteering, and Anti-Tax Evasion Movement Committee, 126 of the 151 attendees confessed to 126 cases related to bribery, fraud, profiteering, and various illegal facts such as fictitious names, private lending, private foreign exchange speculation, and concealment of enemy property. However, the reviews or confessions of the responsible persons in the industrial and commercial circles are mostly not deep or thorough enough. For example, Li Meiquan, Chairman of the Sugar Industry Association, glossed over the matter of stealing state economic intelligence that caused sugar price increases in his speech, and talked a lot about his "lack of understanding of the business of the enterprise," saying that he committed the mistake of "bureaucracy from on high." Yang Shufen, Vice Chairman of the Electrical Equipment Industry Association, distorted the truth when reviewing his profiteering mentality, saying that it was for "accumulating funds and expanding reproduction." The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce criticized these industry leaders who were afraid of confessing, afraid of denouncing, and unwilling to take the lead in promoting the movement. The joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee and the Anti-Bribery, Anti-Fraud, Anti-Profiteering, and Anti-Tax Evasion Movement Committee also dealt with Zhu Peinong, the person in charge of Minfeng and Huafeng Paper Mills, who had committed serious tax evasion and did not actively participate in the movement. Zhu Peinong did not attend two enlarged meetings of the trade association and refused to thoroughly confess. The meeting decided to suspend Zhu Peinong's position as an executive member of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and as Vice Chairman of the Paper Industry Association, and ordered Jin Runxiang, General Manager of Minfeng and Huafeng Paper Mills, to thoroughly confess the facts of tax evasion and profiteering by the two factories immediately. Since the launch of the movement, many law-breaking merchants have been restless. They said: "Above, there is the state (legal sanctions); below, there are children (reporting); beside, there are trade unions; and inside, there are shop employees (reporting)." They are surrounded on all sides.

Currently, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, several large armies to repel the bourgeois offensive have been formed. Thousands upon thousands of small and medium-sized embezzlers have confessed or been reported. Merchants' meetings are generally held in various organizations and groups, and the mass reporting mailboxes set up in the main streets and thoroughfares of the city receive many reporting letters every day. Big embezzlers have been isolated in front of the masses. The battle for a general offensive against embezzlers and for fighting "big tigers" is about to unfold throughout Shanghai.

### 围剿贪污、行贿分子的战斗正在展开  上海工商界开始坦白检举  荣毅仁、胡厥文等坦白出各种违法事实

    围剿贪污、行贿分子的战斗正在展开
    上海工商界开始坦白检举
    荣毅仁、胡厥文等坦白出各种违法事实
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：上海市发动各阶层群众向贪污分子进行围剿的战斗正在展开。工商界在各种力量推动下，也开始展开了坦白检举运动。
    全市人民在党和政府的领导下，已开始积极行动起来参加运动。全市二十万店员站在斗争的最前线，积极揭发不法商人的犯罪行为。仅在极短的时期内，广大店员检举不法商人的行贿、欺诈、偷漏税等犯法行为即达四千件。许多青年团员、家庭妇女，也开始像在镇压反革命运动中检举反革命分子那样检举贪污、犯法的亲属。
    在各种力量的推动下，上海市工商界也开始展开了坦白检举运动。从十九日到二十六日，市工商业联合会先后召开了各种会议，工商界中的许多代表人物和行业负责人分别在不同的会议上带头检讨或坦白。例如市工商业联合会副主任委员、申新纺织公司总管理处总经理荣毅仁坦白了因对国营企业脱期交货造成国家资金重大损失的事实。荣毅仁在一九四九年十二月售给上海市花纱布公司（次年三月改为中国花纱布公司华东区公司）棉纱一千件，一直拖欠到一九五一年秋才偿还。荣毅仁所经营的福新面粉厂也在一九四九年接受国家加工中亏空面粉十一万多包，直到一九五一年六月才缴清。上述两项都使国家的巨额资金积压很久。监察委员会主任委员胡厥文坦白了泄漏国家经济机密的罪行。一九五○年五月他在北京开会时，曾把政府将有大量机器定货的消息用信和电报告诉自己在上海的企业，因此引起了上海五金器材的巨大涨风。市工商业联合会的其他主要负责人如刘鸿生等，也坦白了隐避外汇存款和账外财产等错误行为。又如在执监委员会委员和反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏运动委员会委员联席会议上，到会的一百五十一人中坦白出一百二十六件有关行贿、欺诈、谋取暴利以及虚设字号、私营拆放、私套外汇、隐瞒敌产等各种违法事实。但是工商界负责人的检讨或坦白绝大部分还不深刻、不彻底，甚至如糖业公会主任委员李梅泉在发言中对自己盗取国家经济情报引起糖价涨风一事一笔带过，而大谈其“不了解本企业业务”，说他是犯了“高高在上的官僚主义”的错误。电工器材工业同业公会副主任委员杨树芬在检讨自己的暴利思想时，竟歪曲地说是为了“积累资金，扩大再生产”。上海市工商业联合会对于这些既怕坦白，又怕检举，更不愿带头推动运动的行业负责人，进行了批评。执监委员会和反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏运动委员会联席会议，对犯有严重逃税行为，又不积极参加运动的民丰、华丰造纸厂负责人竺培农也作了处理。竺培农对同业公会两次扩大会议都未出席，并拒绝彻底坦白。会议决定停止竺培农市工商业联合会执行委员的职务和造纸工业同业公会副主任委员的职务，并责令民丰、华丰造纸厂总经理金润庠将两厂逃税事实及牟取暴利行为即日彻底坦白。运动开展以来，许多犯了法的商人都心神不定。他们说：“上有国家（法律制裁），下有子弟（检举），旁有工会，内有店员（检举）。”受到了四面包围。
    目前，在中共上海市委的领导下，打退资产阶级进攻的几支大军已经组成。成千成万的中小贪污分子已经坦白或被检举出来。各机关团体普遍召开商人会议，市区各通街要衢所设立的群众检举信箱，每日都收到不少检举信件。大贪污犯在群众面前已经孤立，向贪污分子总进军、打“大老虎”的战斗即将在上海全市展开。
