    Model Battlefield Telegraph Operator Chen Yan
    Comrade Chen Yan is a telegraph operator. In the long revolutionary struggle, she was twice selected as a model Communist Party member, awarded ten citations for merit, and won first, second, and third class hero medals. This time, she followed the Chinese People's Volunteers in their battles across the mountains and fields of Korea, enduring hunger and fatigue, and overcoming the attacks of illness.
    During the most frequent battles, she often ate cold food, sometimes working for several nights in a row without sleep, buried in front of the machine. Sometimes, when she really couldn't hold on, she would lie down and rest for a while, but when she thought of the soldiers on the front lines and the people of the motherland, she would immediately become energetic and continue working.
    Summer in Korea is a rainy season. Chen Yan and her trainee often squeezed into a low air-raid shelter to work. The roof leaked, and the bottom of the shelter was flooded, so they squatted in the water to work in order not to affect the war effort. In the severe winter with wind and snow, the temperature dropped to minus thirty degrees, and the frozen earth made it impossible to dig air-raid shelters, so they camped in the snowy fields and worked on wiring in the pine forests. When their fingers were numb with cold, they held the pen with their fists to copy and send messages. At this time, she often thought: I am a Communist Party member, and this is precisely when the Party and the people are testing me. Therefore, she not only did not feel hardship, but felt even more joyful. Whenever her superiors asked about her work situation, she would firmly answer: I can handle it, I can complete the task.
    Comrade Chen Yan always persisted in her work in difficult environments, demonstrating the noble qualities of a Communist Party member. She not only won the title of third-class meritorious person in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend the Home and Defend the Country, but also received awards within the Party.

    战地模范报务工作者陈炎
    陈炎同志是一个报务工作者。她在长期的革命斗争中，曾二次被选为模范共产党员，立过十次功，并荣获过一、二、三级英雄奖章。这次她又随同中国人民志愿军转战在朝鲜的山野里，她忍受着饥饿和疲劳，战胜了疾病的侵袭。
    在战斗最频繁的日子里，她经常吃冷饭冷菜，有时一连几个整夜都不睡，埋头在机器旁边工作。有时候实在不能支持了，便躺下休息一下，但是她想到前线的战士和祖国的人民，立刻又精神百倍地紧张起来，继续工作下去。
    朝鲜的夏天，是一个多雨的季节。陈炎和她的见习员经常挤在低矮的防空洞里工作着。洞顶漏雨，洞底出水，她们为了不影响战争的进行，就蹲在水里工作。在风雪交加的严冬里，气温降到零下三十度，冰封了的大地，无法挖掘防风洞，她们便在雪野里露营，在松林里架线工作。手指冻麻木了，便用拳头握着笔去抄发。这时，她常想：自己是一个共产党员，这正是党和人民考验自己的时候。因此，她不但不感觉苦，反觉更愉快起来。每逢上级问及她的工作情况时，她都坚毅地回答：能支持，能完成任务。
    陈炎同志在困苦的环境里，始终坚持着自己的工作，表现了共产党员的高贵品质。她不仅荣获抗美援朝保家卫国的三等功臣的称号，而且在党内也受到了奖励。（附图片）
