    The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant of the Iron and Steel Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government exceeded its 1951 production target on December 27, 1951. All employees wrote a letter to the leaders of the Ministry of Heavy Industry to report the good news, and formulated a production increase and savings plan for 1952, with a target of 210.3 billion yuan.
    The plant's pig iron production in 1951 exceeded the increased production plan by 0.025%. As of December 26, 1951, coke production exceeded the target by 2.47%, cast pipe production exceeded the target by 25.76%, the total increased production donation plan exceeded by 1.03%, and the individual donation plan exceeded by 32.4%.
    All employees said in the letter: We are determined to make persistent efforts, respond to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and support the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. In 1952, in addition to ensuring the completion and exceeding of the production tasks assigned by the state, we also guarantee to increase production and save 210.3 billion yuan for the state, including an increase in production value of 80.1 billion yuan, a saving of capital worth 71.9 billion yuan, an increase in production profit of 21.1 billion yuan, and a further reduction in costs of 37.2 billion yuan.

    今年争取增产节约二千一百零三亿元
    中央人民政府重工业部钢铁局石景山钢铁厂在一九五一年十二月二十七日超额完成了一九五一年的生产任务，全体职工特写信给重工业部首长报喜，并订出了一九五二年的增产节约计划，目标是人民币二千一百零三亿元。
    这个厂一九五一年的生铁产量超过增产计划百分之○·○二五。到一九五一年十二月二十六日为止，焦炭产量超过任务百分之二·四七，铸管产量超过任务百分之二五·七六，全部增产捐献计划超过百分之一·○三，个人捐献计划超过百分之三二·四。
    全体职工在信上说：我们决再接再厉，响应毛主席增产节约的号召，支持抗美援朝的斗争。在一九五二年中，我们除保证完成与超过国家所给予的生产任务外，并保证要为国家增产节约二千一百零三亿元，其中包括增产总值八百零一亿元、节约资金价值七百一十九亿元、增产利润二百一十一亿元，并再降低成本三百七十二亿元。    （新华社）
