    A New Force to Promote the Patriotic Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement
    ——Welcome the Return-Home Delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Visit Delegation of the Korean People

    The people of China warmly welcome the comrades of the Return-Home Delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Visit Delegation of the Korean People with respect and affection. The whole of China is carrying out a great struggle to increase production, practice economy, oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy. We believe that the publicity activities of the delegation comrades will be a new force in promoting the struggle to increase production, practice economy, oppose corruption and waste, and oppose bureaucracy. After a short stay in the capital, the delegation will soon go to various places to comfort the wounded and sick soldiers of the Chinese People’s Volunteers and conduct propaganda work among the people. Local leading organs should make full use of this new force, continue to raise the patriotic enthusiasm of the people, continue to deepen and expand the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and promote a nationwide large-scale movement to increase production, practice economy, oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy.

    The anti-aggression struggle carried out by the Korean people together with the Chinese People's Volunteers has always been a great driving force for our country's various tasks. On all fronts in our country, as long as people think of the Korean front, they will disregard difficulties and dangers and move forward courageously. Dear representatives, tell the people of the whole country the heroic deeds you brought back from Korea, written with life and blood, so that the people of the whole country will be inspired by you and love their great motherland more, and thus more enthusiastically devote themselves to the movement to increase production and practice economy. Let the people of the whole country know that even under such difficult and dangerous conditions, you have set an example by saving your clothes, food, and ammunition for the motherland, and encourage yourselves to more actively and bravely participate in the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

    In order to earnestly do a good job in the delegation's visits to the wounded and sick soldiers and conduct propaganda work in various places, we hope that the local branches of our association will attach great importance to the delegation's work in various places and help them formulate plans for propaganda work in their respective regions. When the delegation arrives, they should assist them in understanding the ideological and work conditions of the local people. At the same time, they should carefully organize representatives from organs, factories, schools, troops, and citizens to listen to and discuss their reports, and broadcast them to the outside world, so as to further develop the patriotic increase production and practice economy movement and the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy through their work.

    推动爱国增产节约运动的一支新的力量
    ——欢迎志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团
    全中国人民以敬爱的心情热烈欢迎志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团的同志们。全中国正在开展增产节约和反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的伟大斗争。我们相信，代表团同志们的宣传活动，对于推动增产节约、反对贪污浪费、反对官僚主义斗争是一支新的力量。代表团在首都稍作停留后，很快就要分别到各地慰劳志愿军的伤病员和向人民群众进行宣传工作。各地领导机关应该充分地利用这支新的力量，继续提高人民群众的爱国热情，继续深入扩大抗美援朝运动，推动全国大规模的增产节约、反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动。
    朝鲜人民和我国人民志愿军在一起所进行的反侵略斗争，一直是推动我国各种工作的一个伟大的动力。我国人民在各个战线上，只要一想起朝鲜前线，就不顾困难，不顾危险，勇往直前。亲爱的代表同志们，把你们从朝鲜带回来的用生命和鲜血所书写的英勇事迹告诉给全国人民，让全国人民受到你们的鼓舞，更加热爱自己伟大的祖国，从而更加热烈地投入增产节约运动。让全国人民知道你们在那样艰苦危险的条件下，还为祖国节约自己的衣服、粮食和弹药的模范行为，激励自己更积极更勇敢地参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争吧。
    为了能够认真地做好代表团到各地慰问伤病员和进行宣传工作，我们希望本会各地分会十分重视代表团在各地的工作，帮助他们拟定在所属地区进行宣传工作的计划。在代表团到达时，应协助他们了解当地群众的思想情况和工作情况。同时应该很好地组织机关、工厂、学校、部队及市民中的代表人物听取和讨论他们的报告，同时对外广播，以便通过他们的工作，进一步地开展爱国增产节约运动和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争。
