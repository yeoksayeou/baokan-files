Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th -- At the Sub-Committee of the Third Agenda of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on January 10th, our side continued to denounce the other side's absurd argument about interfering in our internal affairs. Because our side put forward a revised plan at the Sub-Committee of the Third Agenda on the 9th, the only major obstacle now hindering the rapid conclusion of an agreement on the Third Agenda is the unreasonable demand put forward by the other side, which is firmly opposed by our side, to restrict airport equipment in Korea and interfere in our internal affairs. At the Sub-Committee of the Third Agenda on the 10th, the other side absurdly claimed: "Since your side may or may not restore the airport equipment during the armistice period, you should abandon this uncertain need." Our representative sternly pointed out: "The question of whether or not to carry out airport equipment is entirely a matter of internal affairs, and no one is allowed to interfere in the slightest. What we care about is maintaining our sovereign integrity and internal independence. For more than a year, all our people, all commanders and fighters have bravely fought and struggled for this goal, and they will never allow anyone to infringe on their sovereignty or interfere in their internal affairs."

At the Sub-Committee of the Fourth Agenda, our representative pointed out that our proposal stipulates the rapid release and repatriation of all prisoners of war after the armistice, and our side further clearly stated that we will unconditionally repatriate displaced civilians after the armistice. However, the other side's proposal attempts to detain most of our captured personnel as hostages by means of "one-for-one exchange," and to send our captured personnel and civilians to the Chiang Kai-shek and Li bandits under the pretext of "voluntary repatriation." Our side firmly opposes this absurd proposal.

In addition, our side handed over to the other side a complete Chinese list of fake prisoners. Our side has already submitted to the other side full and complete materials on the prisoners of war we have accommodated, but the other side has repeatedly requested our side to submit to them the Chinese list of fake prisoners requested by the other side. Since the beginning of the Sub-Committee of the Fourth Agenda, the other side claimed that all its prisoner-of-war materials were ready and demanded to exchange them with us, but in fact the materials handed over to us by the other side were just like a pile of waste paper, and even now they have not submitted the basic materials on the whereabouts of 1,456 and 44,205 of our personnel. After our side handed over the complete Chinese list of fake prisoners to the other side, the other side also felt ashamed to not hand over the materials on the whereabouts of 1,456 and 44,205 of our captured personnel, and had to make excuses that the mimeograph machine had broken down. The other side's attitude makes one suspect whether they are sincere in solving the fourth agenda.

    朝鲜谈判第三项议程小组委员会上
    我方继续痛斥美方干涉内政谬论
    对第四项议程美方仍坚持扣留我方被俘人员的无理提案
    【新华社开城十日电】一月十日的朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会上，我方继续痛斥对方关于干涉我方内政的荒谬论点。由于我方在九日的第三项议程的小组委员会上提出了修正方案，现在阻碍着第三项议程迅速达成协议的唯一主要障碍，只剩下对方所提出而为我方所坚决反对的限制朝鲜境内机场设备，干涉我方内政的无理要求。在十日第三项议程的小组委员会上，对方竟荒谬地声称：“既然你方在停战期间可能恢复也可能不恢复机场的设备，你方应该放弃这种不确定的需要。”我方代表严词指出：“进行或不进行机场设备的问题完全是内政问题，不容许任何人加以丝毫的干涉。我们所关心的是维护我们的主权完整和内政独立。一年多以来，我方全体人民，全体指挥员、战斗员正是为了这一目标勇敢地作战奋斗，他们将决不容许任何人侵犯他们的主权，干涉他们的内政”。
    在第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表指出我方的提案规定了停战后迅速释放与遣送全体战俘，我方更明确声明停战后我方将无条件地遣返流离失所的平民。但对方的提案却企图以“一对一交换”的办法，扣留我方绝大部分被俘人员作为人质，以“自愿遣送”的藉口将我方被俘人员和平民送交蒋李匪帮。我方坚决反对这一荒谬提案。
    此外，我方将完整的汉文伪俘名单交给了对方。我方本已向对方提出了我方所收容的战俘的充分而完整的材料，但是对方复要求我方将对方所要求的伪俘的汉文名单提交对方。而自第四项议程小组委员会开始时，对方即声称其全部战俘材料已准备妥当，要求与我交换，但实际上对方交与我方的材料只如一堆废纸，而且至现在犹未交来关于一千四百五十六名和四万四千二百零五名我方人员下落的基本材料。我方将完整的汉文伪俘名单交予对方后，对方亦自感无颜再不交出一千四百五十六名及四万四千二百零五名我方被俘人员下落的材料，只得托辞油印机发生故障云云。对方此种态度实令人怀疑其究竟有无诚意解决第四项议程。
