Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 15th: According to TASS, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began discussing the Soviet delegation's proposal on "Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Consolidate International Peace and Friendship" on the 12th.

Everyone already knew on the 11th that the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, would speak at the meeting, so long before the start of the Political Committee meeting, all the galleries and press seats were already packed. The great concern for the speech of the head of the Soviet delegation and his proposal fully reflects the French people's fervent hope for peace.

Vyshinsky's speech lasted two hours. During his speech, reporters frequently left the meeting to send out excerpts of his speech as telegrams.

Vyshinsky described in detail the consequences of the arms expansion movement by many countries in the aggressive North Atlantic bloc: the expansion of armaments has intensified the international situation and impoverished the vast populations of these countries. Then, amidst the close attention of the representatives and audience, Vyshinsky, on behalf of the Soviet government, presented the following Soviet proposal to the Political Committee:

"(1) The General Assembly declares that participation in the aggressive North Atlantic bloc is incompatible with the status of a member of the United Nations; the establishment of land, sea, and air force bases in foreign territories by certain countries, primarily the United States, is also incompatible with the status of a member of the United Nations.

"(2) The General Assembly considers it necessary to: A. Have all countries participating in the hostilities in Korea immediately cease hostilities, sign an armistice agreement, and withdraw their troops from the 38th parallel within ten days; B. Have all foreign troops and foreign volunteer forces withdraw from Korea within three months.

"(3) The General Assembly considers the use of atomic weapons as an instrument of aggression and a tool for the mass slaughter of people of all countries to be contrary to the honor and conscience of all peoples and incompatible with the status of a member of the United Nations; therefore, it declares an unconditional ban on atomic weapons and establishes strict international supervision over the implementation of this ban, with the aim of implementing the order prohibiting the use of atomic weapons and international supervision simultaneously.

"The General Assembly instructs the Disarmament Commission to draft a convention draft before June 1, 1952, and submit this draft to the Security Council for consideration; this draft shall stipulate measures to ensure the implementation of the General Assembly's decisions on the prohibition of atomic weapons, the cessation of the production of atomic weapons, the use of already manufactured atomic bombs for civilian purposes only, and the establishment of strict international supervision over the implementation of the aforementioned convention.

"(4) The General Assembly recommends that the permanent members of the Security Council—the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, and the Soviet Union—reduce their armaments and armed forces by one-third within one year after the adoption of this decision, based on the armaments and armed forces they possess at the time of the adoption of this decision.

"(5) The General Assembly recommends that all countries, immediately—and in any case within one month—after the General Assembly adopts the decisions on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the five major powers' reduction of armaments and armed forces by one-third, submit all official information on the situation of armaments and armed forces, including information on atomic weapons and military bases on foreign territories. This information should be based on the situation at the time the General Assembly adopts the aforementioned decisions.

"(6) The General Assembly recommends the establishment of an international control body under the Security Council, whose function shall be to supervise the implementation of decisions regarding the prohibition of atomic weapons, the reduction of armaments and armed forces, and the review of information submitted by countries regarding their armaments and armed forces.

"In order to establish an appropriate system to ensure that the General Assembly's decisions on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the reduction of armaments are observed, the international control body shall have the right to conduct long-term inspections, but shall not have the right to illegally interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

"(7) The General Assembly invites the governments of member states of the United Nations and all countries that are not currently member states of the United Nations to hold a world conference to study the issue of large-scale reduction of armaments and armed forces, as well as the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and establishing practical means of international supervision over the implementation of such a ban.

"The General Assembly recommends that the aforementioned world conference be convened as soon as possible, in any case no later than July 15, 1952.

"(8) The General Assembly requests the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, and the Soviet Union to conclude a peace pact and work together to achieve this lofty goal.

"The General Assembly also requests all other peace-loving countries to participate in the peace pact."

After Vyshinsky finished speaking, the representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom spoke. Their speeches showed that the United States and the United Kingdom were attempting to obstruct the General Assembly from taking a decision on these urgent issues that troubled the people of all countries. In his speech, the United States representative once again reflected the United States' fear of the General Assembly discussing the Korean issue.

    联合国大会政治委员会上
    维辛斯基提出巩固国际和平提案
    建议促成朝鲜停战并主张五大国缔结和平公约实行裁军和禁止原子武器
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会政治委员会十二日开始讨论苏联代表团提出的“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施”的建议。
    大家在十一日就已经知道苏联代表团团长维辛斯基要在会上发言，所以在政治委员会会议开始以前很久，所有旁听席和记者席就已经挤满了。大家对苏联代表团团长的发言和他的建议如此关心，这充分反映出法国各阶层人民热烈地希望和平。
    维辛斯基发言历时两小时。在他发言时，记者们不时离开会场把他的发言，摘成电讯发出去。
    维辛斯基详细叙述了北大西洋侵略集团许多国家扩张军备运动所产生的后果：扩张军备使国际局势紧张化，使这些国家的广大人民贫穷化。然后，维辛斯基在代表和听众的密切注意中代表苏联政府向政治委员会提出苏联的提案如下：
    “（一）大会宣告，参加侵略性的北大西洋集团是和联合国会员国的资格不相容的；某些国家，首先是美国，在外国领土上建立陆、海、空军基地，也是和联合国会员国的资格不相容的。
    “（二）大会认为必须使：甲、参加朝鲜境内敌对行动的各国立即停止敌对行动，签订停战协定，并在十天以内把它们的军队撤离三十八度线；乙、一切外国军队以及外国志愿军部队在三个月内撤出朝鲜。
    “（三）大会认为把原子武器当作侵略的工具和大规模屠杀各国人民的工具，是违反各国人民的荣誉和良知的，是与联合国会员国的资格不相容的；因此宣布无条件禁止原子武器并对这个禁令的执行建立严格的国际监督，目的在使禁止使用原子武器的命令和国际监督同时实施。
    “大会责成裁减军备委员会于一九五二年六月一日以前拟就公约草案并把这个公约草案提交安全理事会考虑；这个公约草案要规定一些措施，确保大会关于禁止原子武器、停止原子武器的生产、把已经制成的原子弹只用于民用目的以及对上述公约的执行建立严格的国际监督的决定得以执行。
    “（四）大会建议安全理事会常任理事国——美国、英国、法国、中国、苏联——在通过此项决定后一年内，把它们在通过此项决定时所拥有的军备与武装部队裁减三分之一。
    “（五）大会建议所有国家在大会通过了禁止原子武器和五大国裁减军备与武装部队三分之一的决定后，立即——无论如何要在一个月以内——提出全部关于军备与武装部队的情况的官方情报，包括关于原子武器与在外国领土上的军事基地的情报在内。这种情报应以大会通过上述决定时的情况为准。
    “（六）大会建议在安全理事会之下设立国际管制机构，其职权为监督关于禁止原子武器、裁减军备与武装部队、审查各国所提出的它们的军备与武装部队的情况的情报的决定之执行。
    “为了建立适当的制度以保证大会关于禁止原子武器与裁减军备的决定得到遵守，国际管制机构将有权长期进行视察，但无权非法干涉他国内政。
    “（七）大会邀请联合国会员国与目前还不是联合国会员国的所有国家的政府，举行世界会议，研究大量裁减军备与武装部队问题以及禁止原子武器与对这种禁令的执行建立国际监督的实际办法问题。
    “大会建议尽速召开上述世界会议，无论如何不得迟于一九五二年七月十五日。
    “（八）大会要求美国、英国、法国、中国和苏联缔结和平公约，共同努力，以求达到这个崇高的目的。
    “大会并要求所有其他爱好和平的国家参加和平公约。”
    维辛斯基发言完毕后，美国代表和英国代表发言。他们的发言显示，美国和英国企图阻挠大会来对上述这些使各国人民不安的紧急问题采取决定。美国代表在发言中再一次反映出美国害怕大会讨论朝鲜问题的心情。
