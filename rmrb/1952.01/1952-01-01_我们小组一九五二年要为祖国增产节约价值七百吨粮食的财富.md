Our Group Aims to Increase Production and Practice Economy to Create Wealth Equivalent to 700 Tons of Grain for the Motherland in 1952
    Comrades of the National Coal Miners, Shi Yuhai Group, Xi'an Coal Mine, Northeast:

    1952 has arrived! This is the perfect time to summarize the production situation of the past year and plan for the production work of the new year. Over the past year, under the great call and encouragement of our great motherland and Chairman Mao, our group has overfulfilled the production tasks assigned by the state, completed the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, and also fulfilled the conditions for safe production challenge that we proposed to you before the "May Day" festival this year. Our group has exceeded the coal production task by more than 11 percent throughout the year (from January to December 20th, the same below) on the basis of safety (the challenge conditions for you were to strive to exceed the task by 5 percent throughout the year), and the consumption of raw materials has also been reduced. In total, we have increased production and practiced economy for the country, creating wealth equivalent to 678.13 tons of grain, exceeding the original annual plan for increasing production and practicing economy (483 tons of grain) by 40.4 percent.

    We must not be complacent in the slightest because of this. In order to further respond to the great call of Chairman Mao at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, all the workers in our group have revised the patriotic pact after democratic discussion. We have initially formulated a plan for 1952, deciding that: First, the entire group will increase production and practice economy for the country by 700 tons of grain throughout 1952. The method is to further tap potential capabilities in all aspects. We must operate according to the plan, strictly implement technical operating procedures, improve project specifications and product quality, and support, fill, and control the roof in a timely manner, so that production is safe, output is normal, and steadily increased, and the attendance rate should reach 93 percent; we must further exert the efficiency of machinery, mechanize all transportation work, reduce indirect production personnel, use five pneumatic picks for coal mining, reduce the consumption of gunpowder raw materials, and train ten skilled technical workers (including pneumatic pick operators, drilling workers, support workers, and filling workers), and actively unite with technical personnel. In short, we must improve production efficiency, improve quality, and reduce production costs through various methods. Second, we must strengthen political study and improve class consciousness, while strengthening cultural and technical learning. We will study the basic knowledge of the Communist Party and communism once a week. In addition to participating in pithead school studies, we must improve amateur self-study groups and read the newspaper for 20 minutes before self-study. In addition, we will hold a production technology seminar once a week; study culture four times at the pithead school; and strive to eliminate existing illiteracy by the end of the year. Third, in addition to increasing production and practicing economy, we will respond to the government's call and do a good job in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and supporting the Volunteer Army in other aspects.

    Comrades! Our beloved Chairman Mao calls on us to "continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and need to increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." This is the central task of the Chinese people today! Our coal miners must especially do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy, and do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy to accumulate a large amount of wealth for the country. On the one hand, it can strengthen the material strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, support the Volunteer Army, and accelerate the final victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea; on the other hand, it can accumulate a large amount of funds for the country, and can also open more mines and factories, so that future agriculture can also be mechanized, so that our beloved motherland can quickly move towards a socialist country like the Soviet Union! Increasing production and practicing economy is the fundamental method of building our people's country, and this is our long-term combat mission! If the work of increasing production and practicing economy is not done well, it will reduce the strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and our motherland cannot be quickly industrialized. If the new China is not more prosperous and strong, can we still live a better life? Our mission is so glorious and important!

    Therefore, our group suggests to you: When this new year comes, in addition to summarizing past production experience, we must quickly formulate a specific plan for increasing production and practicing economy for the whole year and other action plans to welcome the great movement of increasing production and practicing economy that will be launched vigorously throughout the country, accumulate a large amount of wealth for the country, and increase the material strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and building the motherland! We hope that you can quickly respond to our suggestions with practical actions and join hands to move forward!

    We wish you a happy new year!
            All workers of the Shi Yuhai Group, Xi'an Coal Mine, Northeast

    我们小组一九五二年要为祖国增产节约价值七百吨粮食的财富
    东北西安煤矿施玉海小组全国煤矿工人同志们：
    一九五二年来到了！这正是总结过去一年生产情况，计划新的一年生产工作的好时候。一年来，在伟大的祖国和毛主席的号召与鼓舞下，我们小组已经超额完成了国家给予的生产任务，完成了增产节约计划，同时实现了在今年“五一”节前我们向你们提出的安全生产挑战条件。我们组全年（一月到十二月二十日，下同）在安全的基础上，超过了产煤任务百分之十一强（向你们挑战条件上是争取全年超过任务百分之五），原材料消耗也降低了。总计全年共给国家增产节约了相当于六百七十八点一三吨粮食的财富，超过原来全年增产节约计划（四百八十三吨粮食）百分之四十点四。
    我们决不能因此而有丝毫的自满情绪。为了进一步响应毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的伟大号召，我们全组工人已经过民主讨论，修订了爱国公约。初步制订了一九五二年的计划，决定：首先，全组在一九五二年全年，要给国家增产节约七百吨粮食。办法是从各方面进一步发挥潜在能力。要按计划正规作业，严格执行技术操作规程，提高工程规格和产品质量，及时支柱，充填，管制顶板，使生产安全，产量正常，并稳步提高，出勤率要达到百分之九十三；要进一步发挥机械效能，运搬工作全部机械化，减少间接生产人员，使用五台风镐采煤，减少火药原材料消耗，培养十名熟练技术工人（包括风镐手，打眼工，支柱工，充填工），主动团结技术人员。总之，要通过各种办法提高生产效率，提高质量，降低生产成本。其次，要加强政治学习，提高阶级觉悟，同时加强文化、技术学习。关于共产党和共产主义的基本常识，每周学习一次。除参加坑口学校学习外，要健全业余自学小组，自学前二十分钟读报。另外，每周召开一次生产技术研究会；在坑口学校学习四次文化；到年底争取消灭现有文盲。再次，除增产节约外，响应政府号召，从其他方面作好抗美援朝及支援志愿军工作。
    同志们！敬爱的毛主席号召咱们要“继续加强抗美援朝工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”，这是中国人民今天的中心任务！咱们煤矿工人特别要作好增产节约工作，把增产节约工作搞好，给国家积累大量财富。一方面可以加强抗美援朝的物质力量，支援志愿军，加速抗美援朝的最后胜利；另一方面，给国家积累了大量资金，还可以开办更多的矿山工厂，使今后的农业也机械化，让咱们亲爱的祖国很快地走向像苏联那样的社会主义国家！增产节约，是建设咱们人民国家的根本方法，这是咱们长期的战斗任务！如果增产节约工作搞不好，便会减少抗美援朝的力量，咱们祖国也不能很快地工业化，新中国若不更加富强，咱们还能过更好的日子吗？咱们的任务是多么光荣重大呀！
    因此，我们小组向你们建议：当这新的一年来临的时候，除了总结过去生产经验外，要很快地订出全年的增产节约具体计划及其他行动计划，迎接伟大的即将在全国范围内轰轰烈烈展开的增产节约运动，给国家积累大量的财富，增加抗美援朝及建设祖国的物质力量！希望你们能很快地用实际行动回答我们的建议，共同携手前进！
    祝你们新年愉快！
            东北西安煤矿施玉海小组全体工人
                        一九五一年十二月二十六日
