    Bureaucrat Adds an Extra Zero, Causing a Backlog and Wasting 300 Million Yuan of National Funds

    Editor: In April 1951, the Chongqing Telecommunications Factory sent a document to the Beijing Telecommunications Industry Bureau requesting the purchase of 500 kilograms of bakelite powder. Xu Shugong of the Bureau's Supply and Marketing Department handled this matter. In the official document he sent to the Tianjin Electrical Appliance Company, he carelessly added an extra zero, turning 500 kilograms into 5,000 kilograms. With bakelite powder costing over 40,000 yuan per kilogram, the purchase of an extra 4,500 kilograms resulted in the backlog of 180 million yuan of national funds. One ton of this batch of bakelite powder was transported by air, costing 66 million yuan in freight; four tons were transported by water, costing 70 million yuan, resulting in a total backlog and waste of approximately 300 million yuan of national funds. Afterwards, the Chongqing Telecommunications Factory wrote back saying, "We only needed 500 kilograms of bakelite powder, and we didn't need any air transport because the freight was much higher than the cost. This is a waste." Everyone, think about how terrible such a careless working style is!  Ren Zu

    官僚主义者多写了一个圈积压和浪费国家资金三亿元
    编辑同志：一九五一年四月，重庆电信一厂给北京电信工业局来文，要求购买五百公斤胶木粉。这事由局里供销处徐树功办理。他在发给天津电器公司的公文上，多写了一个圈，五百公斤就变成五千公斤。胶木粉每公斤四万多，多买了四千五百公斤，就积压国家资金一亿八千多万元。这批胶木粉，空运了一吨，运费六千六百万元；水运了四吨，运费七千万元，总共积压和浪费国家资金约三亿元。事后，重庆电信一厂来信说：“我们只要五百公斤胶木粉，也不需要什么空运，因为运费比成本还高得多。这是一种浪费。”大家想想，这种粗枝大叶的作风多么可怕！  仁足
