To the Editor:
The capitalists of the Daya Weaving Factory in Jiading County delay state orders and use the payments for speculation. At the beginning of Liberation, the factory's general manager, Yang Donghai, took the opportunity to speculate when he saw that prices were about to fluctuate. Because of the losses, he even dispersed the workers. After the factory resumed operations last year, the capitalists continued to speculate. This factory is fundamentally unable to produce silk绒呢 (rongni, a type of woolen fabric). However, the capitalists accepted an order for silk绒呢 from the state-owned China Department Store in Songjiang County, Southern Jiangsu, and he attempted to use this order payment for speculation. After being discovered, the department store asked the factory to publish an apology in the newspaper, but the factory was unwilling. When this factory accepted an order from the Shanghai State-owned Department Store, the workers, in order to be responsible to the state enterprise, suggested to Yang Donghai that he prepare the technical conditions for the manufacturing process. However, he did not accept it, and the order was thus delayed. Such a profiteer who only seeks exorbitant profits and is irresponsible for state orders should be strictly dealt with by the relevant authorities as quickly as possible.

    嘉定县大亚织布厂资方  投机取巧损害国家利益
    编辑同志：嘉定县大亚织布厂资方拖延国家定货，把货款用于投机。解放初，这个厂总经理杨东海看着物价要波动时，乘机投机倒把，因为亏蚀，竟把工人疏散。去年厂里复工后，资方仍然继续投机。这个厂根本不能生产蚕丝绒呢。但资方接受了苏南松江县国营中国百货公司的蚕丝绒呢的订货，他企图把这笔订款拿来投机。被发觉后，百货公司叫这个厂登报悔过，这个厂还不愿意。这个厂在接受了上海市国营百货公司的定货时，工人为了对国家企业负责，就向杨东海建议，要他准备好制造过程中的技术条件。但他没有接受，定货因而脱期。这种一味贪图暴利而对国家定货不负责任的奸商，有关机关应迅速地予以严格处理。
