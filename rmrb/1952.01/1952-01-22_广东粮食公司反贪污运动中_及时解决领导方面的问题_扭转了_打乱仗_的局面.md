    In the anti-corruption campaign of the Guangdong Grain Company, the timely resolution of leadership issues reversed the "chaotic battle" situation.
    The China Grain Company's Guangdong branch promptly resolved the issues that arose during the democratic review, enabling the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign to develop normally.
    At the beginning of the campaign, the company's general manager and deputy manager believed that they were clean and did not make any preparations before convening a general meeting to mobilize the staff and take the lead in self-criticism, launching a democratic review. Because they had been disunited in the past, which had affected some cadres and fostered factionalism, and because the organization lacked democratic life, the staff had accumulated grievances for a long time without an opportunity to express them. Therefore, during the democratic review, everyone enthusiastically offered opinions, which naturally focused on the disunity among the managers and some lifestyle issues. The leaders, because they did not usually understand the opinions of the masses, were taken aback by the fierce criticism and became apprehensive, losing confidence in leading the campaign. Some cadres, influenced by factionalism, were also unable to calmly consider the issues. As a result, everyone's demands were concentrated on the need to "clarify" the issue of the managers' disunity and lifestyle issues, while failing to pay attention to the serious corruption and bribery phenomena within the organization. Some corrupt elements seized this gap, vigorously supporting this view, trying to entangle the campaign in examining the leadership, in order to escape the struggle. Thus, the commander dared not command, the ranks were scattered, the direction was unclear, and a "chaotic battle" situation emerged.
    The Guangdong Provincial People's Government's Department of Commerce promptly noticed this situation. First, it organized the company's staff to study for two days, helping everyone to understand the nature, principles, and policies of the movement. The Chinese Communist Party branch and the Communist Youth League branch of the company also held a general meeting, making it clear to Party members and League members that the movement must be led by the Party, and that after the democratic review, the firepower should be concentrated on launching an anti-corruption struggle. Secondly, a meeting of staff representatives was convened to unite and organize the pure-minded staff in the organization, and the representatives went deep into the masses to mobilize them. Through full deliberation and discussion at the meeting, everyone clearly realized that it was necessary to concentrate firepower on encircling and suppressing corruption, that the issue of the managers' unity should be reviewed, but that lifestyle details should not be clung to. The managers and some cadres expressed their attitudes at the meeting, promising to correct the mistake of disunity. After these measures, all the pure-minded staff united as one, and the corrupt elements were isolated. The enthusiasm of the majority of the staff in fighting corruption increased rapidly. Female employees who had never spoken before offered materials and actively collected clues outside. The confidential report box set up by the company was previously empty, but now confidential reports were increasing daily. When the leading cadres made self-criticisms based on the criticisms of the masses, the firepower of the mass struggle immediately focused on encircling and suppressing corruption.

    广东粮食公司反贪污运动中
    及时解决领导方面的问题
    扭转了“打乱仗”的局面
    中国粮食公司广东分公司及时解决在民主检查中发生的问题，使反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动正常发展。
    运动开始时，该公司正、副经理以为自己手上干净，没有作什么准备就召开全体会议进行动员并带头检讨，开展民主检查。由于他们过去不团结，并影响到一部分干部间存在着宗派主义情绪，机关里缺乏民主生活，工作人员有些意见长期积压没有机会提出，所以在民主检查中大家踊跃地提意见，这些意见很自然地集中在经理间不团结问题上和一些日常生活作风问题上。领导者由于平常不了解群众意见，在群众猛烈批评下大吃一惊，产生顾虑，失掉领导运动的信心。一部分干部由于宗派主义情绪作祟，也不能冷静考虑问题。结果大家的要求都集中在必须把经理不团结问题和生活作风问题“整清楚”，对机关内部某些人员严重的贪污、受贿现象反而不注意。某些贪污分子抓住这一空隙，极力拥护这种意见，想把运动纠缠在检查领导方面，借此逃避斗争。这样，指挥官不敢指挥，队伍零乱，方向不明，呈现出“打乱仗”的局面。
    广东省人民政府商业厅及时注意到这种情况，首先组织该公司工作人员进行了两天学习，帮助大家弄清运动的性质、方针和政策。该公司的中国共产党支部和青年团支部也开了大会，使党员和团员明确认识运动必须由党来领导，在民主检查后要集中火力展开反贪污斗争。其次，召开了工作人员代表会议，把机关里纯正的工作人员团结和组织起来，并通过代表深入发动群众。在会议中经过充分酝酿和讨论，大家明确认识到必须集中火力围剿贪污行为，经理团结问题应该检讨，但生活细节不应扭住不放。经理和一部分干部在会上都表明态度，保证改正不团结的错误。经过这些措施后，所有纯正的工作人员都团结一致，贪污分子陷于孤立地位。大多数工作人员反贪污的积极性迅速提高，向来不发言的女职工纷纷提供材料，主动到外面搜集线索。公司设立的密告箱以前是空的，现在密告信件日有增加。当领导干部根据群众批评意见再作检讨后，群众斗争的火力立即集中在围剿贪污行为上。
