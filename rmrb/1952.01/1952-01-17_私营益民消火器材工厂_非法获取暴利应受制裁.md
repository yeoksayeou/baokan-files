    Private Yimin Fire Extinguisher Factory Illegally Obtains Excessive Profits and Should Be Sanctioned
    Editor: I am now exposing the fact that the private Yimin Fire Extinguisher Factory illegally obtains excessive profits. In October 1951, through the introduction of salesman Li Man, this factory replaced more than 200 barrels of foam extinguisher chemicals for a certain unit of the North China Military Region, charging 50,000 yuan per barrel for the replacement. At that time, comrades from a certain unit of the North China Military Region were unsure whether the chemicals had lost their effectiveness and asked the factory to inspect them. The factory负责人 (fùzé rén - person in charge) said that all the chemicals had to be brought in for inspection. After a complete inspection, they found that the effectiveness of the chemicals had only decreased by two degrees. The factory director and technician Yu Jiesan instructed workers to fill each foam extinguisher with five scoops of the original chemical and two scoops of new chemical, a total of forty-four foam extinguishers, but charged the price of new chemicals for all of them. In addition, Li Man and the factory stipulated that for every 100 barrels of foam extinguisher chemicals replaced, they would only charge for 80 barrels. I believe relevant departments should investigate this matter and sanction the illegal behavior of the factory's capitalists.

    私营益民消火器材工厂  非法获取暴利应受制裁
    编辑同志：我现在揭发私营益民消火器材工厂非法获取暴利的事实。一九五一年十月份，经推销员李曼介绍，这个工厂给华北军区某部换泡沫机药二百多桶，每桶换药费五万元。当时，华北军区某部的同志不明白药力到底已否失效，要厂里检查。工厂负责人说，必须把全部的药拿来检查。经全部检查后，他们发觉药力只减低了二度。工厂厂长兼技师于捷三嘱工人把每个泡沫机装原药五勺，再加新药二勺，共装了四十四个泡沫机，但都按新药的价格收费。另外，李曼和这个厂规定，换一百桶泡沫机药，只收八十桶的价钱。我认为有关部门应检查这件事，并对这个厂资方的不法行为加以制裁。
