    【Our Newspaper's Report】 Based on the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the Southwest Military Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, under the personal leadership of Commander He Long, launched a vigorous and resolute campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, first within the directly subordinate units of the Military Region, displaying no signs of timidity or procrastination.

    After the establishment of the Economy Inspection Committee of the Southwest Military Region, it focused its inspection efforts on the Military Region's Logistics Department and the Cultural Department of the Military Region's Political Department. The guiding principle of the inspection was to clarify the issues, educate comrades, learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and cure the disease to save the patient, ensuring that everyone receives education and every aspect is inspected, while also focusing on severely punishing major corrupt elements. The method was to combine individual confessions, mass reporting, and organizational inspections, boldly mobilizing the masses, convening various meetings, and launching a large-scale, comprehensive, and thorough struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, from within the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to soldiers. From December 20th to 27th of last year, materials revealed at the expanded meetings of the Party committees, Party member meetings, or Party representative meetings of various departments of the Southwest Military Region, reports from the masses, and preliminary investigations by the Inspection Committee, showed that the phenomena of corruption and waste in various departments of the Southwest Military Region were extremely alarming.

    In terms of barrack construction: The Military Region Logistics Department spent over 50 billion yuan on building barracks; most of which should not have been built. They emphasized building "permanent standard buildings," engaging in large-scale construction of Western-style buildings, auditoriums, dining halls, camp gates, gardens, and bathhouses. The Military Region Logistics Headquarters spent 2.6 billion yuan building a bathhouse halfway up a mountain. Some of the barracks, due to improper construction and private merchants' cutting corners, were torn down and rebuilt, resulting in huge losses. The Ordnance Department of the Military Region Headquarters Logistics Department spent 2 billion yuan constructing a three-story Western-style building as a gift to the Logistics Headquarters. The Logistics Headquarters demolished the newly built toilets and spent another 140 million yuan to build new ones. The Military Region's nursery construction was originally budgeted at 2.5 billion yuan, but was later increased to 8.4 billion yuan. The Cultural Department of the Military Region's Political Department spent more than 5 billion yuan to build the "August 1st Theater" without seeking instructions, and privately approved the Chuandong Dazhu Military Sub-district's spending of 300 million yuan to build an auditorium. The Military Region Headquarters spent 1.7 billion yuan building a road (about one kilometer long). The Military Region Health Department spent 9 million yuan building a colorful archway during this year's National Day.

    On the other hand, urgently needed warehouses were not built. For example, the Military Region Logistics Department's oil depot still had 8,000 barrels of gasoline, tires, etc., exposed to the sun and rain under makeshift sheds. Some soldiers were still living in tents. A large part of the barrack construction by various departments was funded by operating expenses. For example, the Military Region Transportation Department used 5 billion yuan of combat funds to build office buildings and Western-style houses. During the Military Region Party Representative Meeting, Yang Jie, the political commissar of this transportation department, altered the construction cost accounts three times, reporting only 10 billion yuan out of the actual expenditure of more than 29 billion yuan.

    More than a dozen major corruption cases have been discovered. For example, Yang Su (enlisted in 1948), a secretary of the Cultural Department of the Military Region Political Department, had been identified as a "Blue Shirt Society" member and former instructor of the puppet Youth Army during the democratic movement; he has now confessed to embezzling more than 20 million yuan of public funds. However, the leading comrades of the Cultural Department of the Military Region Political Department trusted him without principle. Yang Su has now been arrested.

    The phenomenon of arbitrary spending by cadres is also very serious. For example, six leading cadres of the Health Department of the Military Region Headquarters Logistics Department squandered several hundred million yuan privately. They engaged in vulgar gift-giving and entertaining, each possessing Parker pens, watches, and cameras, which they bought and replaced repeatedly, arbitrarily wasting state property. Wang Youzheng, the director of the political department of this Health Department, squandered lavishly under the guise of visiting Northeast China. Tian Chengxiang, deputy director of the Military Region Ordnance Department, and section chiefs Zhao Guangwen and Xie Dajun wasted more than 19.8 million yuan during a month-long meeting in Beijing. When Yang Shanggao, political commissar of the Military Region Logistics Department, and Yao Jiming, deputy director, attended the opening ceremony of a motor vehicle school in a certain location, they brought 30 cadres, guards, and cooks in seven cars, large and small. However, many responsible cadres rarely visited their subordinate units to inspect work. For example, among the six leading cadres of the Health Department, three had not visited the rear hospitals directly under their leadership for more than a year.

    The main experience of the Southwest Military Region's directly subordinate units in carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is to boldly mobilize the masses and use various forms to educate cadres, arousing the enthusiasm of the masses for struggle. The masses, both inside and outside the Party, have long been dissatisfied with extravagance and waste, but had no opportunity to speak out. Once the Party issued the call and explained the reasons, they participated in this movement more enthusiastically than in any other movement, with cadres and soldiers below the battalion level being even more active. Most comrades dared to speak out, and generally spoke seriously, objectively, and with strong principles, greatly educating the leading cadres.

    However, launching the movement was not easy. At the beginning of the movement, the masses had concerns, fearing that the problems could not be solved thoroughly, fearing offending people, and fearing retaliation; the main obstacle was the ideological resistance of some leading cadres who had made mistakes. They believed that "achievements are primary, and shortcomings are secondary." They lacked sufficient understanding of the seriousness of corruption and waste and adopted a passive attitude towards inspection. At the beginning of the movement, they were indifferent; when the problems were exposed, they considered the matter too important, dared not take responsibility, feared the struggle of the masses, and expressed panic at boldly mobilizing the masses. They said, "Boldly mobilizing the masses will lose the prestige of the leadership and make it difficult to work in the future." "We've gone far enough, all the problems have been identified." Some individual leading cadres even suppressed democracy and interfered with others' speeches. Therefore, it is necessary to repeatedly publicize the policies and dispel everyone's ideological concerns. In particular, it is necessary to talk to some of the main responsible cadres, open up their thinking, and seriously tell them that they cannot make the same mistake again and again, but should stand up and boldly examine themselves, promoting and taking the lead in completing this task. Therefore, it must be led by the Party committee, with the main responsible cadres personally "going to the front lines" to publicize the policies, grasp this movement, and support the masses. Only in this way can we strike down the "prestige" of certain cadres and encourage the masses' courage to struggle. This time, Comrade He Long's personal leadership and the personal participation of several responsible cadres of the Party committee in the inspection work played a decisive role in the smooth development of the movement.

### 西南军区贺龙司令员亲自“上前线”  雷厉风行地反对贪污浪费

    西南军区贺龙司令员亲自“上前线”
    雷厉风行地反对贪污浪费
    【本报讯】中共西南军区委员会根据党中央的指示，在军区司令员贺龙同志亲自领导下，首先在军区直属部队开展了大张旗鼓、雷厉风行的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动，毫无畏首畏尾拖泥带水模样。
    西南军区组成节约检查委员会后，就以军区后勤部和军区政治部文化部为重点，进行检查。检查的方针是弄清问题，教育同志，惩前毖后，治病救人，做到人人受到教育，处处受到检查，同时又有重点，严惩大贪污犯。办法是号召个人坦白、群众检举和组织检查相结合，大胆放手地发动群众，召开各种会议，从党内到党外，从干部到战士，大张旗鼓地全面地彻底地展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争。从去年十二月二十日到二十七日一周间，西南军区各部在党委扩大会议、党员大会或党代表会议上揭发的、群众检举的和检查委员会初步调查的材料，说明西南军区各部的贪污浪费现象极为惊人。
    在营房建筑方面：军区后勤部修建营房用款五百亿元以上；其中大部分是不应该修的。他们强调要修“永久性的标准建筑”，大事修建洋楼、礼堂、饭厅、营门、花园、澡塘，军区后勤本部竟用二十六亿元在半山上修了一个澡塘。所修营房中，有些因施工不当，私商捣鬼偷工减料，以致修了再拆，拆了再修，损失极大。军区司令部后勤部军械部以二十亿元修建一座三层洋楼赠送给后勤本部。后勤本部把原来新建的厕所拆掉，又用一亿四千万元另修一个新厕所。军区修盖托儿所，原预算用二十五亿元，后来又追加到八十四亿元。军区政治部文化部没经过请示就用五十多亿元修建“八一剧场”，并私自批准川东大竹军分区用三亿元修建礼堂。军区司令部修一条马路（约一公里）就用了十七亿元。军区卫生部在今年国庆节时，修一个彩牌坊就用了九百万元。
    另一方面，急需建筑的仓库等却没有建筑。如军区后勤部的油库，还有八千桶汽油、车胎等在席棚下日晒雨淋。有的战士住的还是帐篷。各部修筑营房，很大部分是动用事业费，如军区运输部用作战费五十亿元修了办公大楼和洋房。在军区党代表会议期间，这个运输部的政委杨杰曾三次勾改建设费账目，把所用去的二百九十多亿元，仅上报一百多亿元。
    贪污案件已发现较大的十多件。如军区政治部文化部秘书杨苏（一九四八年入伍），在民主运动中已被查出是“蓝衣社”分子、前伪青年军的指导员；现在已坦白出贪污公款二千多万元。但军区政治部文化部领导同志却无原则地信任他。现在已把杨苏逮捕起来。
    干部任意挥霍的现象也很严重。如军区司令部后勤部卫生部六个领导干部私人挥霍了几亿元。他们庸俗地送礼、请客，每人都有派克钢笔、手表、照像机，并且买了又换，换了又买，任意浪费国家财产。这个卫生部的政治部主任王有政，曾以到东北参观的名义，大肆挥霍。军区军械部副部长田呈祥、科长赵广文、谢大钧三人到北京开会一个多月，浪费了一千九百八十多万元。军区后勤部政治委员杨尚高、副部长姚继鸣到某地参加汽车学校开学典礼时，带着干部、警卫人员和厨子三十人，大小汽车七辆。但另一方面，许多负责干部却很少到所属单位检查工作。如卫生部六个领导干部中，有三个人一年多没有去过他们直接领导的后方医院。
    西南军区直属部队开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动以来的主要经验是：放手发动群众，采用各种形式教育干部，启发群众斗争的积极性。党内外群众平时就对那些铺张浪费作风极不满意，但是没有说话的机会。党一号召，讲清道理后，他们参加这次运动比任何运动都要热烈，营以下的干部和战士更为积极。大部分同志都敢把话说出来，并且一般是严肃的、客观的、原则性较强的，对领导干部的教育很大。
    但是，运动的发动并不是容易的。运动开始时，群众有顾虑，怕不能彻底解决问题，怕得罪人，怕报复；主要的障碍是某些犯错误的领导干部的思想抵抗，他们认为：“成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的。”他们对贪污浪费的严重性认识不足，对检查采取消极态度。运动开始时，他们满不在乎；当问题揭发出来以后，他们又考虑事关重大，不敢负责，害怕群众斗争，对放手发动群众表示恐慌不安。他们说：“放手发动群众，会丧失领导的威信，今后不好工作。”“开得差不多了，问题都搞出来了。”甚至有个别领导干部压制民主，干涉别人发言。因此，必须反复宣传政策，打破大家的思想顾虑。特别是应找一些主要负责干部谈话，打通他们的思想，严肃地告诉他们不能一错再错，应站起来大胆检讨，推动和带头完成这一任务。因此，必须由党委领导，主要负责干部亲自“上前线”，宣传政策，掌握这一运动，给群众撑腰。这样才能打下某些干部的“威风”，鼓励群众的斗争勇气。这次贺龙同志亲自领导和党委几个负责干部亲自参加检查工作，对运动的顺利开展，是有决定作用的。
