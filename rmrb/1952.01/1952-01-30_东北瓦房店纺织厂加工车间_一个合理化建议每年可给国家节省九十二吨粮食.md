    Northeast Wafangdian Textile Factory Processing Workshop
    A Rationalization Proposal Saves the Country Ninety-Two Tons of Grain Annually
    Editor: The Zhang Fuqin Advanced Group in the processing workshop of the Northeast Wafangdian Textile Factory has put forward a rationalization proposal to improve the yarn dyeing method, which can save the country ninety-two tons of grain annually. Last August, Zhang Fuqin made a suggestion: to increase production by adding two skeins of yarn to each yarn rod during dyeing. However, factory tests showed that the dyed yarn had too many spots and could not be used. In early December, Zhang Fuqin and the workers in the group re-examined this method. They improved the movements of each operation and adjusted the color matching method. Not satisfied, they further studied and discussed it with technician Li Guanglin. Li suggested changing the length of each skein of yarn from the original two hanks (840 yards per hank) to three hanks, and lengthening the yarn waist by two inches, to make the skein loose and easier to soak in color. After repeated tests, the quality of the dyed yarn was completely maintained, production increased by 10 percent, and labor and water were also saved. According to statistics, after the method is promoted throughout the factory, it can save the country wealth equivalent to ninety-two tons of grain annually.

    东北瓦房店纺织厂加工车间
    一个合理化建议每年可给国家节省九十二吨粮食
    编辑同志：东北瓦房店纺织厂加工车间张福勤先进小组，提出一个改进染线方法的合理化建议，每年可给国家节省九十二吨粮食。去年八月，张福勤提了一个建议：染线时，在每个线杆上加上两把线，以提高产量。但厂里试验结果，染出的线花斑太多，不能应用。十二月初旬，张福勤和小组里的工人重新研究这个方法。他们改善了每个操作的动作，又调整了配色方法。他们还不放心，再和技术员李广林共同研究讨论。李提议把每把摇纱线的长度从原来的两汉克（每汉克八四○码）改为三汉克，并把线腰加长二吋，使线把松，容易浸色。他们经过反覆试验，结果染出的线的质量完全保持正常，产量提高百分之十，而且还节省了人工、用水等。据统计，在全厂推广这个方法以后，每年可以给国家节省财富折合粮食九十二吨。
