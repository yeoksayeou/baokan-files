    Publicly-Operated Jianhua Factory
    Self-Criticism for the Error of Illegally Selling Railcars
    Editor: The People's Daily published a criticism from reader Meng Zhizhong on December 19th of last year regarding our factory's illegal sale of railcars. We sincerely accept this criticism.
    Qi Peiren, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Datong Municipal Public Security Bureau, came to our factory to discuss a joint venture for transporting coal. It was stipulated that our factory would send staff member Wang Fengji to Datong to request railcars, and they would be responsible for purchasing and selling the coal, with profits split equally. Later, our factory also formed a joint venture with the Jufeng Consignment Store to transport coal. In October, the Railway Bureau approved 100 railcars, but only 6 were actually used. Each railcar of coal cost 6.2 million yuan and was sold for 7.5 million yuan. The resulting profits were divided equally between our factory and the Jufeng Consignment Store. In order to correct this error, we sent a letter in November recalling Wang Fengji to the factory, but he deliberately delayed his return. He also applied to the Railway Bureau for 15 railcars for December, of which 5 were actually issued. Due to the serious bureaucracy of our factory's leading cadres, who only saw the interests of small units, a serious error violating policy was committed. In addition to making a self-criticism of this matter, our factory's leading cadres are prepared to thoroughly examine this error during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, and request that higher authorities impose the appropriate punishment.

    检讨非法出售车皮的错误
    编辑同志：人民日报在去年十二月十九日刊载了读者孟致中对我厂非法出卖车皮的批评，我们诚恳接受这个批评。
    大同市公安局总务科长齐培仁曾到我厂商讨合营运煤事，规定我厂派工作人员王凤吉到大同要车，他们负责采购和推销，利益对分。以后，我厂又和聚丰委托商店合营运煤。十月份路局批准给车皮一百个，实走六个。每车煤价六百二十万元，售价七百五十万元，所得的利益，由我厂和聚丰委托商店均分。我厂为了纠正错误，曾在十一月去信调王凤吉回厂，但他故意拖延，又向路局申请十二月份车皮十五个，实发五个。由于我厂领导干部严重的官僚主义，只看到小单位的利益，致造成违反政策的严重错误。除对这件事作检讨外，我厂领导干部准备在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，彻底检查这种错误，并向上级请求给予应得处分。
