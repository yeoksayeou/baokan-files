    Comrade Bo Yibo's Report Inspired the Fighting Spirit of Comrades in the Ministry of Public Security

    All cadres and staff of the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government studied Comrade Bo Yibo's report "Strive to Deeply and Universally Carry Out the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy." This report greatly inspired our fighting spirit.

    Many units, based on Comrade Bo Yibo's report, studied specific steps to deeply carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

    We launched informal talks and discussions targeting the issue of "the rampant attack of the bourgeoisie's corrupt and decadent ideology." This enhanced our vigilance against the influence and erosion of the bourgeoisie's corrupt and decadent ideology. Everyone unanimously expressed that they must take a good bath in this movement to repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attack.

    After listening to Comrade Bo Yibo's report, our fighting courage and enthusiasm increased even more. Many people further understood the government's "differentiated treatment" policy, dispelled their worries, and bravely confessed their own mistakes and exposed those of others. Comrade Hu Xi, a civil servant in the General Office's Administrative Section, said, "Chairman Mao is backing me, and Premier Zhou and Comrade Bo Yibo have all said to oppose corruption, so what am I afraid of!" At the struggle meeting, Comrade Hu Xi exposed the extravagance and waste of the Management Section and many unclean things. Comrade Wang Chengkai of the Administrative Section also confessed to his intention to steal and sell public vehicles.

    Comrade Bo Yibo's report enabled all our cadres and staff to further understand the nature, principles, and policies of this great political movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. We are determined to push the movement further forward. We are confident of achieving victory in the struggle.

    薄一波同志的报告鼓舞了公安部同志们的斗争勇气
    中央人民政府公安部全体干部和工作人员学习了薄一波同志关于“为深入地普遍地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动而斗争”的报告。这个报告，大大地鼓舞了我们的斗争勇气。
    许多单位根据薄一波同志的报告，研究了深入开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的具体步骤。
    我们针对“资产阶级的腐化堕落思想的猖狂进攻”的问题，展开了漫谈和讨论。从而提高了对资产阶级腐化堕落思想的影响和侵蚀的警惕性。大家一致表示：一定要在这次运动中好好洗个澡，以打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻。
    听了薄一波同志的报告，我们的斗争勇气和积极性更加增加。许多人进一步明白了政府“分别对待”的政策，消除了顾虑，勇敢地坦白自己和揭发别人的错误。办公厅行政处公务员胡喜同志说：“毛主席给我撑腰，周总理、薄一波同志都说了要反贪污，我还怕什么！”在斗争大会上，胡喜同志揭发了管理科铺张浪费和许多不干净的事情。行政处王诚凯同志，也交代了自己想盗卖公家车子的问题。
    薄一波同志的报告，使我们全体干部和工作人员，进一步认识了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义这
    一伟大政治运动的性质、方针和政策。我们决心把运动更向前推进。我们有信心取得斗争的胜利。
