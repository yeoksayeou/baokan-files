Summary of Readers' Letters:

In the latter half of December last year, readers sent letters continuously, reflecting cases of doctors being irresponsible towards patients' lives and delaying treatment, leading to death. Therefore, many readers believe that doctors in various places should participate in ideological remolding studies and change their ideological work style of not being responsible to the people. Qin Jing (a Youth League member), a student of Vietnamese at the Department of Oriental Languages of Peking University, sought treatment at Peking University Hospital on the evening of November 18 due to a sudden illness. Doctor Jia Boqi of the hospital emphasized that there were no beds and told her to go to the 54th Hospital for treatment. After repeated requests from accompanying classmates, the doctor reluctantly prescribed medicine for the patient after 1:00 AM, delaying treatment for more than five hours. The patient eventually died. Reader Ao Junshan wrote that Doctor Yan Huaiyu of the People's Hospital on Dongzhimen Street in Beijing refused to give Ao Junshan's son a tetanus shot because Ao Junshan did not have enough money. Despite requesting a preliminary injection and promising to borrow money to repay immediately, it was to no avail, resulting in the child's death. Sun Xianzhou, manager of the state-owned Shandong Aquatic Products Marketing Company, experienced overwork fatigue. During a meeting, he felt physically weak, vomited, and felt dizzy. He went to Shandong Provincial Hospital for treatment. A doctor surnamed Zhang only gave the patient "cocaine" medicine and a mixture of beer and soda. Later, Manager Sun's condition worsened, and he requested Doctor Zhang for treatment again. It was a Sunday, and Doctor Zhang was resting and out, and could not be found, delaying the patient's treatment and leading to death. Zheng Guozhang, a locomotive driver from Fengtai Locomotive Depot, took a train from Andong back to the Tianjin Railway Bureau. He fell ill en route and went to the General Hospital of Shenyang Railway Hospital for treatment. The chief physician of the hospital said, "We don't admit employees who are resisting America and aiding Korea here. You should go to Changchun Hospital. They admit employees who are resisting America and aiding Korea." This attitude of emphasizing division of labor and disregarding seriously ill patients aroused great dissatisfaction among readers. Leading cadres of the Xinyang Special District Cadre Sanatorium in Henan have a bureaucratic work style. Serious phenomena such as patient deaths, deaths due to surgery, and deaths due to injections often occur in medical work. There are not many patients in the sanatorium, but according to incomplete statistics from January to September 1951, the average number of patient deaths reached four per month. The masses call the "People's Hospital" the "Death Hospital." Readers suggested that doctors serve the broad masses of the people, and their erroneous ideological work style must be seriously transformed.

    有些医师不负责任贻误病人应该积极改造思想改变作风
    ——读者来信综述
    去年十二月下半月，读者不断来信反映医师对病人生命不负责任，贻误病人致死的事。因此，许多读者都认为各地医师应该参加思想改造学习，改变对人民不负责任的思想作风。北京大学东方语文学系越南语科学生秦静（青年团员），十一月十八日晚因急病到北大医院就诊，医院大夫贾博琦强调没有病床，要她到五四医院去治。后来经过陪送同学再三请求，直到半夜一点钟，大夫才不耐烦地给病人开方吃药，中间耽误了五个多钟头，患者终于不治身死。读者熬君珊来信说：北京东直门大街人民医院大夫阎怀玉因为熬君珊没有带着足够的钱，就不给他儿子打破伤风针，虽经请求预先注射，立刻借钱偿还，仍无结果，致使小孩身亡。国营山东水产运销公司经理孙先舟因工作过度疲劳，在开会时体力不支，呕吐头晕，到山东省立医院治疗，一张姓大夫只给病人吃“扣可因”药，和啤酒汽水合剂。后来孙经理病情转剧，再请张大夫诊治。时值星期日，张大夫休息外出，遍寻不见，贻误病人致死。丰台机务段机车司机郑国璋乘火车从安东回天津路局，中途得急病，到沈阳铁路医院总院治疗，医院主任医师说：“我们这里不收抗美援朝职工，你上长春医院去吧，那里收抗美援朝职工。”这种强调分工、置严重病人于不顾的态度，引起读者极大不满。河南信阳专区干部疗养院的领导干部有官僚主义作风，医疗工作中常发生病人死亡和开刀割死人、打针打死人的严重现象。疗养院病人不多，但据一九五一年一月到九月的不完全统计，平均每月死亡病人达四人。群众都把“人民医院”叫做“死人医院”。读者提出：医生是为广大人民服务的，他们这种错误的思想作风，必须认真加以改造。
