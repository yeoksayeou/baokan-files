The Beijing Democratic Women's Federation convened a mobilization meeting for women from all sectors in Beijing on the afternoon of the 5th, focusing on increasing production and practicing economy, opposing corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. More than 800 people attended, including representatives of female workers, representatives of workers' families, representatives of peasant women, committee members from women's representative meetings of various district派出所(police stations), and representatives from various women's organizations and democratic women. Comrade Zhang Xiaomei, the chairwoman, spoke first, calling on women from all sectors to actively participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, vigorously increase production and practice economy, support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and strive for greater victories in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. She encouraged women to dispel all kinds of concerns, mobilize their husbands, fathers, brothers, and relatives to confess, and if they stubbornly refuse to confess, to bravely report them. She cited many such facts and praised them. She particularly pointed out that housewives should actively participate in reporting illegal acts such as corruption and extortion in cooperatives and派出所(police stations), and Chairman Mao and the People's Government will definitely support everyone. If women suffer harm as a result of reporting, they should immediately report to the Women's Federation, which will definitely provide support and protection.

In terms of increasing production and practicing economy, she called on women to take the lead in opposing extravagant and wasteful phenomena in weddings, funerals, childbirths, and celebrations of one-month anniversaries, and to establish a new, simple social atmosphere.

Finally, she instructed women to actively cooperate with inspection work and to carry out repeated and patient propaganda to the masses. The municipal and district women's federations should set up reporting boxes and receive reporters at any time. Good examples of reporting should be commended, so that this movement is known to every household.

Wang Yingpu, Minister of the Women Workers Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, called on female workers and workers' families to actively participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. She said: "Female workers should actively participate in learning, break down all kinds of concerns, examine themselves, and report others. They should promote the spirit of the working class's public-mindedness and play a vanguard role in the movement. Workers' families should first mobilize family members and relatives to confess, and if they refuse to confess, report them."

Ping Ruifen, a representative of female workers from the clothing factory, reported that female workers have already actively participated in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. For example, Wang Shuhua and others not only confessed to taking public cloth threads and other things, but also mobilized and reported others. Since the launch of the movement, the 11th class of the first sewing department saved enough thread in January to make more than 4,000 pairs of socks.

Wang Lanying, the deputy mayor of Dongba Town and a representative of peasant women, said: It is our right to report corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. She said that she will definitely lead the women in her town to participate in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in a planned and step-by-step manner.

Qian Mengfan, a family member of an employee of the Electric Power Bureau, reported on the process of mobilizing her husband to confess to embezzling public funds. Huang Zhi, a representative of the industrial and commercial women's association, said: Industrial and commercial women must actively report corrupt and bribery-taking elements. In addition, Sun Zhiying and Yang Xueteng, representatives of street women, reported how they broke through ideological concerns and reported corrupt elements.

    北京市民主妇女联合会于五日下午召开北京市各界妇女增产节约、反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义动员大会。到会有女工代表、工属代表、农妇代表、各区派出所妇女代表会议的委员、各妇女团体及民主妇女代表等八百余人。首由主席张晓梅同志讲话，她号召各界妇女积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动、厉行增产节约，支援中国人民志愿军，争取抗美援朝战争的更大胜利。她鼓励妇女要解除各种顾虑，动员丈夫、父兄、亲友坦白，如果他们坚不坦白，就要勇敢地起来检举。她列举了很多这样的事实，并加以表扬。她特别指出家庭妇女要积极参加检举合作社、派出所的贪污、敲诈等不法行为，毛主席、人民政府一定给大家撑腰。如果妇女因为检举受到了危害，马上向妇联报告，妇联一定加以支持和保护。
    在增产节约方面，她号召妇女要带头反对在婚丧嫁娶、生孩子做满月等方面的铺张浪费现象，树立新的、朴素的社会风气。
    最后她指示妇女们应积极配合检查工作，要向群众进行反复的、耐心的宣传。市、区妇联要设立检举箱，并随时接见检举者。如有检举的好范例，应加以表扬，务使这运动做到家喻户晓。
    市总工会女工部部长王瑛璞号召女工和工属积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，她说：“女工们要积极参加学习，打破各种顾虑，检查自己，检举别人，要发扬工人阶级大公无私的精神，在运动中起先锋作用。工属要首先动员家属亲友坦白，不肯坦白的就检举他们。”
    被服厂女工代表平瑞芬报告女工已经积极起来参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，像王淑华等不但自己坦白曾拿公家的布线等东西，还动员检举了别人。自从运动展开后，第一缝纫部第十一班在一月中节省的线，可以做四千多双袜子。
    农妇代表东坝镇副镇长王兰英说：检举贪污、浪费、官僚主义分子是我们的权利。她表示回去一定要有计划、有步骤地领导本镇妇女群众参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争。
    电业局职工家属钱梦凡报告动员丈夫坦白贪污公款的经过。工商界家庭妇女会代表黄织表示：工商界家庭妇女一定要积极起来检举贪污行贿分子。此外，还有街道妇女代表孙志英、杨雪腾报告她们如何打破思想顾虑检举了贪污分子。
