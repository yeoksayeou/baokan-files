Qingdao Business Community Representatives Hold Meeting
Opposing Bribery, Profiteering, and Tax Evasion

    The Qingdao Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee mobilized the city's business community to launch a mass movement against profiteering, bribery, waste, and tax evasion. Since the second plenary session of the Qingdao Municipal People's Government Committee on December 20 decided to vigorously launch a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy throughout the city, the city's industrialists and businessmen have expressed their support. Therefore, in accordance with the resolutions of the second plenary session of the Municipal People's Government Committee, and in view of the illegal acts, profiteering, bribery, tax evasion and other phenomena existing in Qingdao's business community, the Qingdao Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee decided to universally launch a "Four Antis" movement within the city's business community. On the 24th, more than 1,200 representatives from various industries in the city's business community held a meeting against profiteering, bribery, waste, and tax evasion. Huang Yuanji, acting director of the Qingdao Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, explained at the meeting that carrying out the "Four Antis" movement is an important method for industrialists and businessmen to carry out enterprise transformation and ideological reform. He pointed out that bad ideas and actions such as profiteering, bribery, waste, and tax evasion have serious harm to the country, the people, and the enterprises themselves. He said: "These bad behaviors will not only reduce national fiscal revenue, cause unreasonable burdens on the people, and affect the normal development of production, but more seriously, they will weaken the strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and will greatly hinder the development of economic construction and national defense construction." He called on all industrialists and businessmen in the city to actively mobilize and resolutely fight against these bad behaviors. Zhang Kejun, deputy director of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, made a mobilization report on carrying out the "Four Antis" movement at the meeting. He emphasized that carrying out the "Four Antis" movement is a just demand and action of the vast number of patriotic industrialists and businessmen. He then used specific examples to illustrate the various erroneous thoughts and actions that currently exist in various industries. He said: Some industrialists and businessmen pursue exorbitant profits. For example, some manufacturers in the boot and shoe industry cut corners in the processing of military shoes, resulting in defective products and rejects accounting for 59 percent of all orders, seriously harming the interests of the country; the papermaking and grocery industries have unreasonably increased production profits; some manufacturers in the cotton and textile industries falsely report costs and pursue exorbitant profits; the thread tying and auction industries have driven up prices; the flour milling industry refused to process for state-owned enterprises during the peak season, and the phenomenon of adulterating flour with fake and damp flour also continued to occur; in particular, the private Dayuan Rubber Factory made exorbitant profits by fraudulent means in undertaking the production of military raincoats, causing a loss of 5.26 billion yuan to state property. The act of bribery is also very serious in the business community. For example, in order to seek private gain, private Li Hua, Jin Chang and other eight electrical material stores used despicable means to lure staff of government departments and organizations to steal state property. The phenomenon of tax evasion also still exists in the business community, and as many as sixteen despicable methods of tax evasion have now been discovered. Zhang Kejun pointed out that all industrialists and businessmen in the city must mobilize unanimously, vigorously and resolutely launch the "Four Antis" movement, and carry out a merciless struggle against these illegal thoughts and behaviors. Only by smashing the four big stones of profiteering, bribery, waste, and tax evasion can our production increase and economy movement be carried out well; our economic construction and national defense construction can have a vigorous development prospect.
    At the meeting, representatives from the electrical materials, flour milling, import and export and other industries made public self-criticisms on the problems that have been discovered in their respective industries. All the representatives expressed that they must do a good job in this movement. According to the proposal of Huang Yuanji, acting director of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, the conference established an inspection mechanism based on the business community study committee, so as to conduct a comprehensive inspection in a guided and systematic manner, and truly make the "Four Antis" movement of the business community a mass movement.

    青岛市工商界代表举行大会
    反对行贿反对暴利反对偷漏税
    青岛市工商业联合会筹备委员会动员全市工商界展开群众性的反对暴利、反对贿赂、反对浪费、反对偷漏税运动。自十二月二十日青岛市人民政府委员会第二次全体会议决定在全市范围内大张旗鼓地展开反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动后，全市工商业者纷纷表示拥护。因此，青岛市工商联筹委会根据市人民政府委员会二次全会的决议，针对青岛市工商界目前存在的违法舞弊、贪图暴利、实行贿赂、偷税漏税等现象，决定在全市工商界内普遍开展“四反”运动。二十四日，全市工商界各行业代表一千二百多人举行了反暴利、反贿赂、反浪费、反偷漏大会。青岛市工商联筹委会代主任黄元吉在会上说明开展“四反运动”是工商业者进行企业改造和思想改造的重要方法。他指出暴利、贿赂、浪费、偷漏等坏的思想和行动，对国家、人民和企业本身都有严重的危害性。他说：“这些恶劣行为、不仅会减低国家财政收入，造成人民不合理的负担以及影响生产的正常发展，更严重的是削弱了抗美援朝的力量，并将大大地阻碍经济建设和国防建设的发展。”他号召全市工商业者积极地动员起来，坚决地与这些恶劣行为进行斗争。市工商联筹委会副主任张克俊在会上做了开展“四反”运动的动员报告。他强调指出开展“四反”运动是广大爱国工商业者的一个正义的要求和行动。他接着用具体事例说明当前各行业中存在着的各种错误思想和行动。他说：有一些工商业者追求暴利，例如靴鞋业的某些厂商在军鞋加工中偷工减料，以致次货和废品占全部订货的百分之五十九，严重地损害了国家利益；造纸业和杂货业都不合理地提高生产利润；制棉业、纺织业中有些厂商虚报成本、追求暴利；线扎业、拍卖业曾哄抬物价；磨粉业在旺季时拒绝为国营企业加工，在面粉中掺假使潮的现象也不断发生；特别是私营大元橡胶厂在承制军用雨衣中，用欺诈手段牟取暴利，使国家财产损失五十二亿六千多万元。在工商界中贿赂的行为也十分严重，如私营利华、锦昌等八家电料行为了营私自肥，竟以卑劣的手段，诱惑机关团体的工作人员，盗卖国家资财。工商界中偷税漏税的现象也仍然存在，现在已发现的偷税漏税的卑劣办法有十六种之多。张克俊指出：全市工商业者必须一致动员起来，大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地展开“四反”运动，向这些非法的思想行为进行无情的斗争。只有把暴利、贿赂、浪费、偷漏这四块大石头粉碎了，我们的增产节约运动才能开展得好；我们的经济建设和国防建设才能有蓬勃发展的前途。
    会上，电料、磨粉、进出口等行业的代表纷纷就本行业已经发现的问题做了公开的检讨。全体代表都表示一定要搞好这一运动。大会根据市工商联筹委会代主任黄元吉的提议，以工商界学习委员会为基础建立检查机构，以便有领导、有系统地进行全面检查，使工商界的“四反”运动真正成为群众性的运动。            （新华社）
