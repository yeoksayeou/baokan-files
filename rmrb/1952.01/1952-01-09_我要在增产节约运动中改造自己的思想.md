    I Want to Remold My Thinking in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement

    I am a technician, and I have many shortcomings in my thinking. After two years of study and experience, I have realized the importance of ideological remolding. Especially in the recent movement of increasing production and practicing economy and compiling production plans for 1952 in our factory, as well as the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, my understanding of ideological remolding has been further enhanced.
    In the past, I always thought that I was doing technical work, which was superior to others. Therefore, I thought that calculating costs and managing funds were the responsibility of accounting staff, and even that corruption and waste were only related to accounting staff. Later, after participating in the work of clearing assets and valuation, I began to wake up. I realized that if technical personnel do not actively support cost calculation and fund management, it will inevitably lead to a lot of waste and poor management in the enterprise. For example, inaccurate valuation of main equipment will directly affect the calculation of costs and fund management in terms of depreciation expenses. The backlog of many assets is not caused by management personnel, but mainly due to the irresponsibility and carelessness of technical personnel in making quotas or budgets. All of these indicate that technical personnel must cooperate with management personnel to manage the enterprise well.
    Through this movement, I have further realized that only by relying on the masses of workers can we run the enterprise well. When clearing assets and making valuations, the technical personnel did not dare to make decisions on the service life of the machines. After consulting the old workers who were with the machines every day, the problem was solved, and the conservative thinking of many technical personnel was also broken.
    Technical personnel can only exert their due strength by strengthening contact with those who manage production and those who directly produce. For this reason, technical personnel must also be good mass workers, with a high degree of political cultivation and rich technology combining theory and practice, to do their work well.
    The idea of closely linking with the masses and caring about state property, like the above, was lacking in the past among technical personnel.
    I urgently request ideological remolding. I want to actively study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and remold myself in the actual movement of increasing production and practicing economy, overcoming individual heroism and the hired labor point of view. This is my plan for 1952, and it is also my program of action.

### 我要在增产节约运动中改造自己的思想

    我要在增产节约运动中改造自己的思想
    我是一个技术人员，在思想上有许多毛病。经过两年来的学习和体验，我知道了思想改造的重要性。特别在最近我们工厂开展的一九五二年增产节约和编制生产计划的运动中，以及反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的运动中，我对思想改造的认识更提高了
    一步。
    过去，我一直以为我干的是技术工作，比别人都高，因此，以为计算成本、资金管理，都是会计人员的事，甚至以为贪污浪费也只和会计人员有关系。以后参加了清理资产估价的工作，我才开始猛醒过来。我认识到技术人员如不积极作计算成本、资金管理的支援者，就必会使企业发生很多浪费和管理不好的现象。例如，主要设备估价不准确，那么就会在折旧费上直接影响计算成本和资金管理工作。很多资产的积压，并不是管理人员造成，而主要是由于技术人员不负责任、马马虎虎地作定额或造预算所致。所有这些，都说明技术人员必须和管理人员合作，才能把企业管好。
    通过这个运动，我更知道了只有依靠工人群众才能搞好企业。清理资产估价时，对机器的使用年限，技术人员都不敢作主，向天天和机器在一块的老工友请教以后，才把问题解决了，也打破了许多技术人员的保守思想。
    技术人员只有和管理生产的人和直接生产的人加强联系，才能发挥应有的力量。为此，技术人员又必须是一个好的群众工作者，具有高度的政治修养和丰富的理论与实际结合的技术，才能把工作作好。
    像以上紧密连系群众，关心国家财产的思想，在过去的技术人员中是缺乏的。
    我急切要求思想改造，我要积极学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，并在增产节约的实际运动中改造自己，克服个人英雄主义和雇佣观点。这就是我一九五二年的计划，也是我行动的纲领。
