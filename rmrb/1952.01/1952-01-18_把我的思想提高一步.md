Take My Thinking a Step Higher
    Miao Peishi

    Over the past two years, I have written quite a few things, in various forms. Some of them have cooperated with the Party's current political propaganda and played a good role, having a certain impact on the masses. However, comrades have said that my writings are low in ideological and artistic quality; some are even inferior, and many are dispensable. In the past, I was not able to accept these opinions honestly. Because I thought writing was better than not writing, and inferior goods were better than no goods at all. In this way, I was complacent and very satisfied with my little achievements. This time, at the beginning of the rectification and study in Beijing's literary and art circles, I listened to Comrade Hu Qiaomu's mobilization report. He sharply pointed out literary and artistic creation’s slowdown and shoddy work as an extremely bad and intolerable phenomenon, calling on everyone to thoroughly rectify and transform. After more than a month of study, according to the spirit of the documents, I examined and reflected on some of the things I had written.

    In my works, many are superficially writing about whatever I encounter, writing about whatever I think, using rushing to meet tasks as an excuse. As for the ideological content of these works, and how much educational significance they have for the people, I thought very little about it, and did not stand on the Party's position to consider the ideological content of what I wrote at all times with an attitude of responsibility to the people; anyway, I "rushed" it out and put it out. I am not very familiar with the things I write about, and I lack enthusiasm and understanding for the characters I write about. Chairman Mao said in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "Chinese revolutionary writers and artists, promising writers and artists, must go to the masses, must go to the workers, peasants and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally and wholeheartedly, must go to the fiery struggle, to the only broadest and richest source, to observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, all natural forms of literature and art, and then it is possible to enter the processing process, that is, the creation process, so as to unify the raw materials with production, and the research process with the creation process." However, my writing attitude is exactly the opposite, rather than Ma Hengchang comes, "rush" Ma Hengchang, Liu Yingyuan comes, "rush" Liu Yingyuan, Li Shunda comes, "rush" Li Shunda. My works should be said to be crudely made, with low ideological and artistic quality.

    Ideological content, this is the soul of literary and artistic works. Only works with high ideological content—works that can truthfully and vividly reflect life and embody the Party's policies—can universally and deeply educate the broad masses of people and raise their ideological awareness. For popular and accessible literary and artistic works, precisely because they are easily accepted by the masses in terms of form, and they are to be sent directly to the hands of the masses, the requirements for their ideological content cannot be lowered. Otherwise, providing the people with superficial and shoddy things will not only be of no benefit to the people, but will also be harmful. Examining my works in this way, it is very obvious that I have not met this basic need of the people. In many of the stories I wrote praising labor models (such as the clapper talks about Zhao Zhankui, Li Fenglian…etc.), and short stories (such as "Good Squad Leader", "Biography of Wang Xian", "Miners' Uprising"…etc.), I superficially described the surface facts and the activities of the characters. I did not delve deeper into excavating the objective facts and the ideological essence—the soul—of the characters. I simply and casually sketched what these characters did on paper; but why did these characters do this, and not that? In my stories, it is difficult to give readers a satisfactory answer. In this way, what I describe is only various phenomena—the soldiers' brave killing of the enemy, the workers' active production—but I cannot explain the meaning of this behavior and the universal truth that exists in them. Therefore, my praise often falls flat, as if it is just praise for the sake of praise; what is the use and effect of this kind of praise? Works with such low ideological content are dispensable and cannot achieve the purpose of educating the people. Therefore, to use works to educate the people, the most fundamental thing is to truly understand the thoughts and feelings of the workers, peasants and soldiers, shape their true heroic images, and express the advanced ideas of the times that they possess, which serves the people, loves the motherland, and loves the people, in accordance with the high principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Only such works are the works urgently demanded by the broad masses of people, and can satisfactorily complete the work of improving the people's thinking. This requires me to take my thinking a step higher.

    The reason why my works are not high in ideological content is also due to my tendency to simply pursue form. I often say: writing should be in simple language, and should be able to be spoken in prose, and sung in verse; those who know how to read can understand it, and those who don't know how to read can understand it. Generally speaking, there is nothing wrong with this. The problem is that I simply focus on sounds, tunes, and wording, and cater to certain backward tastes and consciousness of the masses. This made me unable to break through the old forms when using old forms, but instead ignored the ideological content and became a prisoner of the old forms. For example, in the drum lyric "Zhao Hengde Makes Havoc on the Zhengtai Road," when describing the scene of the enemy and us in the war, I used some clichéd and hackneyed expressions with no standpoint and objectively, distorting the great image of our People's Liberation Army. This piece was written in 1945 when I was in the Taihang District. After it was finished, I took it to the artists to perform. The artists added some old sentences in describing the war scene, such as "...The boy worships Guanyin, and Erlang carries water for a journey. This old tree has good roots, and that white ape steals peaches..." which was very popular with the audience. So I accepted these sentences without any criticism. When printing a simple version in Taihang Mountain, the comrades responsible for the review had already deleted these inappropriate sentences, but when I arrived in Beijing, I had the opportunity to compile the "New Quyi Series" and print the full version of "Zhao Hengde Makes Havoc on the Zhengtai Road," so I added these sentences back as they were. From this specific fact, it can be explained how much I miss the old feelings and tastes, and it also shows my lack of discipline in my work. I usually do not study politics enough, and I do not understand the Party's policies deeply. My political level and ideological level are very low.

    In terms of writing attitude, why did I make the mistake of shoddy work? This is related to my intentional or unintentional view of "popularization for the sake of popularization." I think the feudal literary and artistic front is so broad and deep, and our new works—works that the masses can understand—are so few; therefore, I advocate "harmlessness" everywhere—that is to say, there is no major problem with the work, as long as it is slightly better than those old things (but it is not necessarily good). In this way, I invisibly lowered the requirements for the ideological and artistic quality of artistic works. I demand this of others, and even more so of myself.

    In order to cover up the shoddy writing attitude, I often say: Don't be afraid! Although I write roughly, I have completed the task. Using "rushing to meet the task" excused myself, and also excused others. Of course, it should be said that it is a glorious responsibility for a literary and art worker to be able to rush to meet the task and complete the work of propaganda and education to the masses in a certain period of time. But using rushing to meet the task as a shield, as if you have the right to write bad works, is irresponsible to the masses and loses the Party's position.

    In the past two years, I have also been in opposition to some comrades in the literary and art circles in many works, and have not been able to get along with them, with serious sectarian emotions; this has prevented me from learning from the advanced people in the literary and art circles, and has prevented me from cooperating with comrades inside or outside the Party. I can only talk to a few comrades; even among a few so-called compatible comrades, there is no (and cannot) establish a serious political life of criticism and self-criticism, but has developed the vulgar and bad habit of mutual flattery. I have rarely (or even never) put forward criticism of the works written by the comrades who work with me. When others have put forward criticism, although I also know that it is very correct, but when I meet the comrades who are being criticized, I do not tell him that he should pay attention to his mistakes, but say some unprincipled words to excuse his mistakes. In this way, it is impossible for us to start a normal struggle of literary and artistic ideas. Sometimes, comrades who care for me tell me that they hope that I will go deep into life, carefully construct, and write something that is educational for the people. These opinions are correct and valuable, but I rarely consider them, or even do not consider them at all. In our editing work, I clearly know that some comrades' purely technical views on works have been developing, but I rarely raise objections. This is exactly as Chairman Mao said in "Combat Liberalism": "Because of acquaintances, fellow villagers, classmates, close friends, loved ones, old colleagues, old subordinates, knowing that it is wrong, they do not engage in principled disputes, let it go, and seek peace and intimacy, or give a light description, without a thorough solution, and preserve a group of harmony. The result is harmful to the group and to the individual."

    In many meetings where I can speak, I often express to the audience: I am "not in the mainstream" in the literary and art circles, and I am "half a journalist" in the press. Saying this is not to show my humility, but precisely to feel that I have achieved success and made contributions in popularization work. You don't recognize me, I recognize myself; you don't recognize me, I don't recognize you even more. Because the works you write, you think are advanced, but the masses cannot accept them, and the masses do not buy them. If there is a sales channel, most of them are bought by libraries. On the other hand, look at what I wrote, don't you think the artistic quality is low, but it sells more than yours. - That's what I think.

    When giving lectures to workers and students, if someone asks me what literary and artistic publications I read, I say: read "Talk and Sing," and the rest seem unnecessary to read. If someone asks me about the relationship between improvement and popularization, I say: "Let's not care about those so-called improvements; don't look at the fact that some people welcome their improvements today, as long as we work hard to do popularization work and implement Chairman Mao's literary and art direction well, please see who's literary and art world it will be in ten or twenty years." In fact, this is to completely separate popularization work from improvement work, and fundamentally deny the improvement on the basis of popularization. This idea of only wanting popularization and not wanting improvement is a serious violation of Chairman Mao's instructions on literary and artistic popularization work.

    Because I engage in literary and artistic work with serious sectarian emotions, it has developed into a deep prejudice against some comrades. I always think that others say they are for the workers, peasants and soldiers, but in fact they are not for the workers, peasants and soldiers. It seems that only oneself, or only a small group of people that oneself recognizes, is truly for the workers, peasants and soldiers.

    Why did I develop such serious liberalism and sectarianism? All objective reasons are not the main ones. The most important thing is that I came from the petty bourgeoisie. Although I lived in the old liberated areas for a long time and went through rectification and study, I did not seriously and thoroughly transform myself ideologically. In this way, at a certain time, when I encounter some specific problems, I cannot handle them well from the Party's position. Instead, I make small territories and small circles, and everything starts from personal reputation and status, showing off my own "heroism." In this way, I cannot use the literary and artistic weapons well and serve the people wholeheartedly.

    After this rectification and study, I have a further understanding of myself. I actually have no understanding of literature and art, and my path is wrong. From now on, I will honestly be a primary school student, study from scratch, regularly and seriously study the Party's policies, study Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, go deep into the masses' struggle to obtain the source of creation, improve my thinking a step further, and write some ideological works that are truly loved by the masses, so as to better serve the people.

    把我的思想提高一步
    苗培时
    二年来，我写了不少的东西，这些作品的形式是多种多样的。其中有些篇，也配合了党的当前的政治宣传，起过一点好作用，在群众中有了一定的影响。但是同志们都说我写的东西思想性和艺术性低；甚至有一部分是劣等货，很多是可有可无的东西。我过去对于这些意见，是不能够老老实实地接受的。因为我觉得写了总比不写好，劣等货总比没有货色强。这样，我就沾沾自喜，很满足于自己的一点成绩。这次北京文艺界整风学习一开始，听了胡乔木同志的动员报告，他把文艺创作上的怠工和粗制滥造，作为一种极端恶劣的、不能容忍的现象，尖锐地提出来，号召大家彻底地整顿改造。经过一个多月的学习，根据文件的精神，我把我写的一些东西检查了一下，做了反省。
    我的作品中，有很多都是浮光掠影地碰到什么写什么，想到什么写什么，以赶任务为藉口“赶”出来的。至于这些作品的思想性如何，对人民有多大的教育意义，我想得很少，就没有站在党的立场上，以对人民负责的态度，时时刻刻地考虑自己所写的东西的思想性的问题；反正“赶”了出来，拿出去就算了。对于自己所写的事并不十分熟悉，对于自己所写的人物缺乏热情和认识。毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中说：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全身心地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的泉源中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切自然形态的文学和艺术，然后才有可能进入加工过程即创作过程，这样地把原料与生产，把研究过程与创作过程统一起来。”可是我的写作态度，却正与之相反，而是马恒昌来了，“赶”马恒昌，刘英源来了，“赶”刘英源，李顺达来了，“赶”李顺达。我的作品，应该说是粗制滥造出来的，思想性和艺术性都很低。
    思想性，这是文艺作品的灵魂。只有思想性高的作品——能够真实地、生动地反映生活，体现党的政策的作品，才能够普遍深入地教育广大人民，提高人民的思想觉悟。对普及的通俗文艺作品来说，正因为它在形式上容易为群众所接受，它要直接送到群众的手中去，就更不能降低对它的思想性的要求。否则，把一些内容肤浅的、粗制滥造的东西供给人民，对人民不但没有丝毫好处，而且是有害处的。以此来检查我的作品，那就很明显，我是没有满足人民这种起码的需要的。在我写的许多歌颂劳动模范的故事中（如关于赵占魁、李凤莲……等人的快板），短篇小说中（如“好班长”、“王贤传”、“矿工起义”……等），我都是很肤浅地把表面的事实和人物的活动交代了一下。我没有更深入地把客观事实和人物的思想本质——灵魂发掘出来，我只简单地把这些人物所做的事情，潦草地轻描淡写地往纸上一画；但这些人物为什么要这样做，而不是那样做？在我的故事中，是很难给读者一个圆满的答案的。这样，我所描写的就只是种种现象——战士们的勇敢杀敌，工人们的积极生产，而不能说明这种行为的意义，和它们所存在的普遍真理。所以我的歌颂就常常落了空，好像只是为了歌颂而歌颂；这种歌颂又有什么用处、什么效果呢？像这样思想性低的作品，就是可有可无的，不能达到教育人民的目的。所以要用作品教育人民，最根本的还是要真正理解工农兵的思想感情，塑造他们真正的英雄形象，表现他们所具有的时代的先进的思想
    是为人民服务、爱祖国、爱人民，合乎马列主义、毛泽东思想的高度的原则的。只有这样的作品，才是广大人民迫切要求的作品，才能圆满地完成提高人民思想的工作。这就要求我必须把我的思想再提高一步。
    我的作品所以思想性不高，也由于我还有单纯地追求形式的倾向。我常常说：写东西要语言通俗，要做到散文能说，韵文能唱；认识字的看得懂，不认识字的听得懂。一般地这样说，并没有错误。问题在于我只是单纯地讲求音、腔、字句，并迁就某些群众落后趣味与意识。这样就使我在运用旧形式的时候，不但不能突破旧形式，反而忽略了思想内容，作了旧形式的俘虏。像我写的鼓词“赵亨德大闹正太路”，在描写敌我战争的场面上，我就毫无立场地、客观主义地，搬用了一些陈词滥调，把我们解放军的伟大形象歪曲了。这篇东西是一九四五年我在太行区的时候写的，写完了拿给艺人去表演，艺人在描写战争的场面上，加了一些“……童子就把观音拜，二郎担水赶一程。这一个老树盘根玩得好，那一个白猿偷桃耍得精……”的旧句子，很受听众的欢迎。于是我就毫无批判地把这些句子接受下来了。当在太行山印简本的时候，负责审查的同志，已经把这些不伦不类的句子删掉，但到了北京，我有了编“新曲艺丛书”的机会，能把“赵亨德大闹正太路”的全本印出来，我就又把这些句子原封不动地给加上了。从这个具体的事实上，就可以说明我是怎样地留恋旧的感情与趣味，也说明我在工作中缺乏纪律性。我平日对于政治的学习不够，了解党的政策不深，我的政治水平与思想水平都是很低的。
    在写作的态度上，我为什么犯了粗制滥造的毛病？这和我有意无意的“为普及而普及”的观点相联系的。我认为封建文艺阵地是那样的广大而深入，我们新的作品——群众看得懂，听得懂的作品那样少；因此，我就到处提倡“无害论”——就是说作品没大问题，只要比那些老东西稍好（其实不一定好）就可以了。这样无形中我就把对于艺术作品思想性和艺术性的要求降低了。对旁人要求这样，对自己要求更是这样。
    为了给粗制滥造的写作态度打掩护，我常说：不怕！我虽然写得粗糙点，可是我是赶了任务的啊。用“赶任务”原谅了我自己，也同样地原谅了别人。当然，一个文艺工作者，能够赶任务，完成一定时间的向群众宣传教育的工作，应该说是一种光荣的责任。但以赶任务做挡箭牌，好像自己就有了写坏作品的权利，那就是对群众不负责任，失掉了党的立场。
    两年来，我还在很多的工作中，和文艺界的某些同志闹对立，合不来，有着严重的宗派主义的情绪；妨碍我向文艺界的先进们学习，使我不能和党外或党内的同志们合作。谈得来的只是少数的几个同志；就是在几个所谓合得来的同志之间，也没有
    （也不可能）建立起批评与自我批评的严肃的政治生活，而是发展了庸俗的互相恭维的恶劣作风。对于和我共同工作的同志写的作品，很少有（甚至从来没有）提出过批评的意见。当别人提出了批评，我虽然也知道很对，但当和被批评的同志见了面，不是告诉他应该注意他的错误，而是说些无原则的话，原谅了他的错误。这样，在我们中间，就不可能展开正常的文艺思想的斗争。有时候，爱护我的同志告诉我，希望我深入生活，精心结构，写些对人民有教育意义的东西。这些意见是对的，是宝贵的，可是我很少考虑，或者根本没有考虑。在我们的编辑工作中，我明明知道，有的同志对待作品的纯技术观点已经在发展，但我很少提出反对的意见来。这正像毛主席在“反对自由主义”中说的：“因为熟人，同乡，同学，知心朋友，亲爱者，老同事，老部下，明知不对，也不发生原则上的争论，任其下去，求得和平与亲热，或轻描淡写的说一顿，不作彻底解决，保存一团和气。结果有害于团体，也有害于个人。”
    在许多自己能够说话的会上，我常常向听众们表示：我在文艺界“不入流”，在新闻界是“半个记者”。说这话并不是表示自己虚心，却正是觉得自己在普及工作中有成绩，有功劳。你们不承认我，我自己承认我；你们不承认我，我更不承认你们。因为你们写的作品，你们觉得是提高的，实际上群众不能接受，群众不买，假若说有销路的话，也不过大部分都是图书馆买去的。反过来看看我写的呢，你们不是认为艺术性低吗，但比你们卖得多呀。——我就是这样想的。
    当给工人、学生们讲课时，若有人问我看什么文艺刊物，我就说：看“说说唱唱”，其余的好像都不必要看。若有人问我提高与普及的关系时，我就说：“我们大家不要管那些所谓提高；别看今天还有一部分人欢迎他们的提高，只要我们努力做普及工作，把毛主席的文艺方向执行好，请看十年、二十年后，到底是谁家的文艺天下。”实际上这是把普及工作与提高工作截然分开了，根本否认了在普及基础上的提高。这种只要普及而不要提高的思想，正是严重地违背了毛主席对于文艺普及工作的指示的。
    因为我带着严重的宗派主义的情绪，来从事文艺工作，就发展到对于某一些同志也有了很深的成见。总以为别人都是口头上说为工农兵，实际上都不是为工农兵的。真正为工农兵的好像只有自己，或者只有自己承认的一小群人。
    我为什么发展了这样的严重的自由主义和宗派主义的情绪呢？一切客观的原因都不是主要的，最主要的还是我出身于小资产阶级，虽说在老解放区住了好久，也经过整风学习，但在思想上并没有认真地彻底地改造自己。这样，在一定的时候，一碰见一些具体问题，我就不能很好地站在党的立场上来处理，反而闹小地盘，小圈圈，一切从个人的名誉地位出发，逞自己的“英雄”。这样我就不能很好地运用文艺武器，很好地全心全意为人民服务了。
    经过了这次整风学习，我更进一步地认识了我自己。我对于文艺其实并没有什么认识，我的路是走得不对的。今后，我要老老实实地做个小学生，从头学习，经常地认真地学习党的政策，学习毛主席的文艺思想，深入到群众的斗争中去，取得创作的泉源，把我的思想提高一步，写一些有思想性的真正为群众喜闻乐见的作品出来，更好地为人民服务。（原载一九五二年第一号“文艺报”）
