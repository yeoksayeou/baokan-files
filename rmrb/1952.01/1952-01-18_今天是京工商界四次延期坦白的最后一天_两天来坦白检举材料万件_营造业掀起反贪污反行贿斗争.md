    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Committee for Frugality Inspection decided to suspend the inspection of industrial and commercial circles for three days. Since then, industrial and commercial households throughout the city have significantly increased their confessions and accusations of illegal activities such as bribery, tax evasion, embezzlement of state property, and theft of state economic intelligence. According to extremely incomplete statistics, the Municipal Frugality Inspection Committee received approximately 10,000 pieces of confession and accusation materials on the 16th and 17th alone. Including those received previously, the total has reached over 35,000 pieces. In particular, under the leadership of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, many managers of construction companies have begun to confess to major crimes of bribery, tax evasion, and embezzlement of state property. The anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in this industry has rapidly unfolded.

    On the 17th, in addition to various industry associations and district offices of the Federation of Industry and Commerce holding various meetings to continue mobilizing industrial and commercial households to confess their illegal activities, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, in order to rapidly promote the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in the construction industry, convened a meeting of more than 100 construction operators. Seeing the shameful end of Liu Yuanjing, manager of Jingye Construction Company and a奸商 (crafty merchant/profiteer), those attending the meeting not only began to confess their illegal activities, but also dared to tear apart personal relationships and accuse certain manufacturers of tax evasion or shoddy workmanship in construction projects, forcing those manufacturers who were still not honest enough to confess their problems. Some construction manufacturers, such as the manager of Dacheng Construction Company, even admitted that they had formed an “alliance of offense and defense” with corrupt officials. This has initially exposed the bad phenomenon of mutual cover-up and concealment of criminal behavior among members of the construction industry under the influence of 奸商 (crafty merchants/profiteers) like Liu Yuanjing in the past. These 100-plus construction operators confessed and accused of approximately 200 pieces of materials. Many of these were major incidents of bribery, tax evasion, and embezzlement of state property. For example, the manager of Daxing Heji Construction Company confessed that he had embezzled more than 200 million yuan of state property by overestimating prices and cutting corners, bringing the total, including previous confessions, to more than 600 million yuan. Kanning Construction Company obtained illegal profits of more than 200 million yuan by cutting corners in contracted construction projects. Xinxing Construction Company bribed cadres with more than 75 million yuan. Yiji Fuxing Construction Company obtained illegal profits of more than 110 million yuan by fraudulent means. Daye Construction Company bribed cadres with 30 million yuan and obtained illegal profits of 50 million yuan.

    However, whether in the construction industry or other industries, there are still some industrial and commercial households who refuse to confess. Even among those who have confessed, many have not honestly confessed all of their problems. For example, one construction manufacturer had consistently refused to admit to illegal activities such as bribery, tax evasion, and shoddy workmanship, but when another manufacturer asked him if he had colluded with a certain cadre, he hastily admitted to bribing this cadre with more than 2 million yuan; however, he still avoided talking about other criminal activities. At a reporting meeting hosted by the Federation of Industry and Commerce last night, some construction manufacturers who had confessed more thoroughly specifically studied the confession materials of various companies and, based on the facts they knew, suspected that many manufacturers still had bribery, tax evasion, and shoddy workmanship behaviors. Therefore, the Construction Industry Association has decided to continue holding group meetings today to further mobilize everyone to thoroughly confess. If some people are still obsessed with their mistakes and attempt to muddle through, it is completely impossible. Because on the one hand, they can never escape the eyes of their fellow members and will inevitably be exposed by everyone; on the other hand, after the deadline expires, the Beijing Municipal Committee for Frugality Inspection will continue to conduct inspections and will never allow any 奸商 (crafty merchants/profiteers) to escape the net. Once discovered, they will be sanctioned by state law. Today is the last day of the suspension of inspection approved by the Municipal Frugality Inspection Committee. All industrial and commercial households in the city should immediately make up their minds and quickly confess all their criminal activities, and never miss the opportunity again and test the law with their own bodies.

### 今天是京工商界四次延期坦白的最后一天  两天来坦白检举材料万件  营造业掀起反贪污反行贿斗争

    今天是京工商界四次延期坦白的最后一天
    两天来坦白检举材料万件
    营造业掀起反贪污反行贿斗争
    【本报讯】北京市节约检查委员会决定对工商界的检查暂停三天以后，全市工商户坦白检举行贿、偷税、盗骗国家资财和盗窃国家经济情报等不法行为已显著增加。根据极不完全的统计，在十六、十七两天内，市节约检查委员会共收到坦白检举的材料约一万件。如把以前收到的一并计算在内，已达三万五千件以上。特别是营造业在市工商联的领导下，许多营造厂的经理已开始坦白了较大的行贿、偷税和盗骗国家资财的犯罪行为。这个行业的反贪污、反行贿运动已经迅速开展。
    十七日除全市各行业公会和工商联各区办事处多数召开了各种会议，继续动员各工商户坦白自己的不法行为以外，工商联为了使营造业的反贪污、反行贿运动迅速开展起来，召集了一百多户营造业者的会议。到会的营造厂商看到敬业营造厂经理、奸商刘元敬等的可耻下场，在会议上，不但有许多人开始坦白了自己的不法行为，而且敢于撕破情面，检举某些厂商在建筑工程中偷税或偷工减料等犯罪行为，使那些态度仍然不够老实的厂商不得不把自己的问题交代出来。有些营造厂商，如大成营造厂经理还承认自己曾经和受贿干部有过“攻守同盟”。这样就使得过去在奸商刘元敬等影响下，营造业会员互相包庇、互相隐瞒犯罪行为的恶劣现象初步被揭穿了。这一百零几家营造厂商，共约交代了二百多件坦白和检举的材料。其中有许多是较大的行贿、偷税和盗骗国家资财的事件。如大兴合记营造厂经理坦白出曾经用高估价格和偷工减料的方法盗骗了国家资财两亿多元，连前已坦白的在内共达六亿多元。康宁营造厂在承包建筑工程时偷工减料，获得非法利润两亿多元。新兴营造厂向干部行贿达七千五百多万元。义记复兴营造厂用欺骗手段获得非法利润一亿一千多万元。大业营造厂向干部行贿三千万元，得到非法利润五千万元。
    但是，无论营造业或其他行业，仍然有一些工商户拒不坦白，就是在已经坦白的人中，不少人还没有老老实实地把自己的问题全部交代清楚。如某家营造厂商过去始终不肯承认有行贿、偷税和偷工减料等不法行为，但当另一厂商问他是否和某一干部共同舞弊时，才慌忙承认曾向这个干部行贿二百多万元；可是他对于其他的犯罪行为则仍然避而不谈。在昨晚工商联主持的汇报会议上，营造业有些坦白较彻底的厂商具体研究了各家坦白的材料后，根据他们所知道的事实，都怀疑不少厂商还有行贿、偷税和偷工减料的行为。因此营造业公会已决定今日再继续分组开会，进一步动员大家彻底坦白。有些人若仍然执迷不悟，企图混过去，是完全不可能的。因为一方面他们绝不能逃脱同业会员的眼睛，必然会被大家检举出来；另一方面，限期届满以后，北京市节约检查委员会即将继续进行检查，绝不容许任何奸商漏网。查出来，受到国家法律的制裁。今天是市节约检查委员会批准停止检查的最后一天。全市工商户应即痛下决心，从速把自己的一切犯罪行为坦白出来，切勿再错过机会，以身试法。
