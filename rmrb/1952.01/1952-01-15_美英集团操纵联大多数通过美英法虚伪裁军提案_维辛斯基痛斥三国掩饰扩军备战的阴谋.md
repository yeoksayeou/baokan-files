Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 14th: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the afternoon of the 11th to begin examining the issues submitted to the plenary for discussion by the various committees after preliminary discussions. The meeting first presented and voted on the US, British, and French proposal on "regulation, limitation, and balanced reduction of all armed forces and all armaments." Assembly President Nasrollah Entezam announced that according to the rules of procedure, proposals adopted by committees need not be discussed further unless requested by more than one-third of the delegations. Due to the decision passed by the US-British bloc majority, this proposal was not further discussed at the Assembly, and delegations only made brief statements explaining their votes.

As previously reported, this proposal was discussed in the Political Committee for a month, and the Soviet delegation and many other countries pointed out that the content of this proposal was inconsistent with its stated goals, because it neither stipulated the prohibition of atomic weapons, nor the reduction of armaments and armed forces, nor the establishment of supervision over the implementation of these tasks, and the resolution of these issues is of great significance for ensuring peace. During the vote in the Political Committee, nearly one-third of the delegations did not support this proposal.

At the plenary meeting on the 11th, representatives of many countries criticized the proposal when explaining their votes. The Egyptian representative reminded the Assembly of the amendments proposed by the Soviet delegation to the three-power proposal in the Political Committee (the Soviet amendment stipulated the prohibition of atomic weapons, the five major powers would first reduce armaments and armed forces by one-third within one year, and the United Nations would establish strict international supervision over the implementation of these measures. This amendment was rejected by the US-British bloc majority). The Egyptian representative said that these two suggestions reflected two diametrically opposed policies. He emphasized that he did not belong to the Soviet camp, nor to the Western camp. He said he could not support the US proposal because it considered the prohibition of atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction of humanity to be a very slim purpose. The US suggestion of investigating armaments in stages to complete disarmament is as unreasonable as suggesting treating cancer by first treating a cold. He emphasized that prohibiting the use of atomic weapons is not only urgent but also completely feasible, and this task does not require first solving the complex issue of establishing international supervision.

The Indian representative also stated that he could not vote in favor of the US proposal. He said that any practical and feasible plan for disarmament, prohibition of atomic weapons, and establishment of international supervision must be based on the agreement of all major powers possessing the greatest war potential.

The spirit of the speeches by the representatives of Argentina and Indonesia was the same as that of the Indian representative.

The Polish representative pointed out in his speech that no one should be deceived by the title of the three-power proposal, because the purpose of the three-power proposal is to oppose the prohibition of atomic weapons and oppose disarmament. The representatives of Czechoslovakia, the Ukrainian Republic, and the Byelorussian Republic also pointed out in their speeches that the task of the three-power proposal is to deceive public opinion and conceal the aggressive plans of the North Atlantic bloc.

Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky, in stating the Soviet Union's reasons for voting, insisted on the position taken by the Soviet Union on this issue and sharply criticized the three-power proposal. Vyshinsky pointed out that this proposal did not address any disarmament issues. The trick played by this proposal on the issue of disarmament is that it attempts to replace genuine disarmament and armed forces reduction with the collection of information on armed forces and armaments, and therefore, its true purpose is to obstruct the reduction of any armaments and armed forces. At the same time, it does not advocate the prohibition of atomic weapons at all. He pointed out that the purpose of the United States, Britain, and France is merely to systematically divert people's attention from their military aggression plans, arms expansion movements, and huge war budgets.

After Vyshinsky's speech, the three-power proposal was put to a vote. Forty-two votes were in favor; five votes (Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Byelorussia, and Ukraine) were against; and seven delegations (Argentina, Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Burma, Yemen, and Egypt) abstained. If the delegations that did not participate in the vote are included, then approximately one-third of the United Nations member states refused to support this proposal.

    美英集团操纵联大多数通过美英法虚伪裁军提案
    维辛斯基痛斥三国掩饰扩军备战的阴谋
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会在十一日下午举行全体会议，开始审议各委员会在经过初步讨论后提交全体会议讨论的问题。会上首先提出了美、英、法三国关于“规定、限制和均衡地裁减一切武装部队和一切军备”的提案，并且表决了这个提案。大会主席纳孚宣布：根据议事规则，除非有三分之一以上的代表团要求，各委员会所通过的提案不必再进行讨论。由于美英集团多数所通过的决定，这个提案在大会上没有再进行讨论，各国代表团仅作了简短发言，说明投票理由。
    前已报道，这个提案在政治委员会曾讨论了一个月，苏联代表团和许多其他国家的代表都曾指明：这个提案的内容和它所标榜的目标是不一致的，因为它既没有规定禁止原子武器，也没有规定裁减军备和武装部队，也没有规定对这些工作的执行建立监督，而这些问题的解决对于确保和平是有极重大的意义的。在政治委员会中进行表决时，有将近三分之一的代表团没有支持这个提案。
    在十一日的全体会议上，许多国家的代表在说明投票理由时，都对这个提案提出了批评。埃及代表提醒大会注意苏联代表团在政治委员会上对三国提案提出的修正案（苏联修正案规定禁止原子武器、五大国首先在一年内裁减军备及武装部队三分之一、联合国对这些措施的执行建立严格的国际监督。这个修正案被美英集团的多数所否决），埃及代表说，这两个建议反映了两个截然相反的政策。他强调他并不属于苏联阵营，也不属于西方阵营。他说他不能支持美国的提案，因为这个提案认为禁止原子弹及其他大规模屠杀人类的武器是非常渺茫的目的。美国建议分阶段调查军备来完成裁减军备就像建议用先治疗伤风的办法来治疗癌症一样地不合理。他强调禁止使用原子武器不但是迫切的而且是完全可行的，这件工作并不需要先行解决复杂的建立国际监督的问题。
    印度代表也表示他不能投票赞成美国提案。他说，任何裁减军备、禁止原子武器和建立国际监督的切实可行的计划，必须建立在拥有最大战争潜力的一切大国协议的基础之上。
    阿根廷和印度尼西亚代表的发言的精神和印度代表的发言精神相同。
    波兰代表的发言指出：任何人都不应该受三国提案的题目的欺骗，因为三国提案的目的是反对禁止原子武器、反对裁减军备。捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰共和国和白俄罗斯共和国的代表也都在发言中指出，三国提案的任务是欺骗舆论，掩饰北大西洋集团的侵略计划。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在申述苏联的投票理由时，坚持苏联在这个问题上所采取的立场，并且尖锐地批评了三国提案。维辛斯基指出，这个提案并没有处理任何裁减军备的问题。这个提案在裁减军备的问题上所玩的花样就是：它企图用搜集关于武装部队和军备的情报来代替真正裁减军备和武装部队，因此，它的真正目的是阻挠裁减任何军备和武装部队。同时，它也根本不主张禁止原子武器。他指出，美、英、法三国的目的不过是要有计划地转移人们对它们的军事侵略计划、扩张军备运动和庞大的战争预算的注意罢了。
    维辛斯基发言后，三国提案即被提付表决。四十二票赞成；五票（苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、白俄罗斯和乌克兰）反对；七个代表团（阿根廷、巴基斯坦、印度、印尼、缅甸、也门和埃及）弃权。如果把没有参加投票的代表团计算在内，那末，就有大约三分之一的联合国会员国拒绝支持这个提案。
