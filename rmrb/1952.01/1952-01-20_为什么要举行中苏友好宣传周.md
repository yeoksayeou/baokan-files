　　Why Hold a Sino-Soviet Friendship Propaganda Week

　　February 14th this year marks the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters issued a notice on December 18th last year, calling on all parts of the country to hold a week-long Sino-Soviet friendship publicity campaign around this anniversary.

　　China and the Soviet Union are the two largest countries in the world, accounting for one-third of the world's population. The two countries share a border of thousands of miles. The people of the two countries have had a deep friendship for a long time. Soon after the victory of the great October Revolution in 1917, the Soviet government automatically abolished all privileges in China and abolished the unequal treaties concluded between Tsarist Russia and the old Chinese government. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, the Soviet Union lent money to China and sent air force to help our country fight against Japan. In August 1945, the Soviet Union sent troops to Northeast China, annihilated the Japanese imperialist's elite Kwantung Army, and forced Japan to surrender. On October 1, 1949, after the founding of New China, the Soviet government immediately announced its severance of relations with the remnant Kuomintang bandits, recognized New China, and established diplomatic relations with our country. On February 14, 1950, it signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with our country, and the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union became even more consolidated, and the Chinese people had a strong ally.

　　In the past two years, the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union has been further enhanced, and more than 20.18 million people across the country have joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The influence of anti-Soviet propaganda, which had been spread by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries for a long time, has been basically eliminated. Today, it is of great significance for us to further understand the great significance of the Sino-Soviet alliance, the nature of socialist countries, and the advanced experience of Soviet construction. This is because:

　　First, the Sino-Soviet alliance is a fortress for consolidating our motherland and defending peace in the Far East and the world.

　　In the past two years, the people of the whole country have conscientiously implemented Chairman Mao's instruction to "unite with the Soviet Union, unite with all new democratic countries, and unite with the proletariat and the broad masses of people in other countries." We have achieved great victories in resisting US imperialist aggression. Our volunteers and the Korean People's Army have annihilated 500,000 enemies in more than a year, forcing US imperialism to hold armistice negotiations with us in Korea, disrupting US imperialism's aggression plan, and disputes have also occurred within the US ruling group. Last spring, after MacArthur suffered a major defeat in Korea, he advocated immediately bombing China, using the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops to participate in the war, and blockading China's coast. Truman, Acheson and their ilk also wanted to do so in their hearts, but they did not dare to do so. This is because on the one hand, they fear the strength of the Chinese people; on the other hand, because of the existence of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, they fear that the Soviet Union will come out to help China. The then US Secretary of Defense Marshall once said: "If the danger of Soviet intervention did not exist, the CCP base would be bombed immediately!"

　　From this point, we can see how important the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is to defending the security of our motherland and defending peace in the Far East. The strong alliance between China and the Soviet Union has become an important force for defending world peace.

　　Second, Soviet assistance is a necessary condition for building our motherland.

　　In the past two years, in our national construction work, Soviet assistance, including assistance in construction experience, has helped us overcome many difficulties. For example, the Soviet Union once lent us a sum of money, supplied us with a large number of industrial construction equipment, and sent a large number of experts to China to help us carry out economic construction and cultural and educational construction. The advanced Soviet production methods have also begun to spread widely in our country. For example, many of our workers have learned the Soviet Kovalev method of work, which has greatly improved production efficiency. The famous 1951 weaving method is a summary of the working characteristics of advanced weaving workers in our country using the Kovalev method. The promotion of the Soviet metal high-speed cutting method has increased the efficiency of machine tools in many factories by ten to thirty times. In railway transportation, Northeast railway workers learned from the Soviet Union and promoted the movement of 500-day kilometers per vehicle; they also learned from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in shunting and road maintenance. In the coal mining industry, we learned the Soviet Union's new coal mining methods and mine safety methods. In agriculture, we learned the Soviet Union's close planting method, pasture rotation method, etc., and at the same time established a number of state-owned farms that use machines for cultivation. In terms of culture and education, the advanced Soviet educational ideas and educational methods have also played a great role in the reform of our country's educational undertakings. In the work of preventing and controlling plague and foot-and-mouth disease of livestock in Inner Mongolia and other places, we have also received strong assistance from the Soviet Union.

　　Now, the people of the whole country are vigorously carrying out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and then carrying out a large-scale patriotic movement to increase production and practice thrift. This is the fundamental way for us to strengthen the resistance to US aggression and aid Korea and build our motherland. In this regard, we can learn more from the Soviet Union's experience. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union embarked on industrialization by increasing production and practicing thrift. During the Soviet Union's post-war five-year plan, the funds accumulated by reducing costs accounted for about 160 billion rubles in the entire national economy, which is equivalent to 64% of the total national economic investment; in industry, it was about 120 billion rubles, which is equivalent to three-quarters of the total industrial investment. Looking at these achievements of the Soviet Union, it has increased our confidence in carrying out the patriotic movement to increase production and practice thrift a hundredfold.

　　Third, the happy life of the Soviet people points out the future prospects for our people.

　　We know that the Soviet people are the happiest people in the world. They have eliminated the exploitation system, built a socialist society, and are moving towards a communist society. The workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the Soviet Union successfully completed the post-war five-year plan in just over four years, and their lives are rapidly improving. For example, the Soviet Union's national income in 1940 (before the Patriotic War) was five times higher than in 1913 before the revolution, and in 1951 it exceeded 1940 by 81%. In the four years after the war, the Soviet Union reduced prices four times, benefiting the people 301.5 billion rubles. The Soviet Union has 1.3 million university students, exceeding the total number of university students in all capitalist countries in Europe and Asia. The Soviet working people universally enjoy benefits such as free medical care, sickness allowances, pension insurance, and vacations. In 1951, the Soviet National Social Insurance Fund allocated 21.1 billion rubles. Soviet trade unions have nearly 1,200 sanatoriums. In various parts of the Soviet Union, there are more than 4,400 cultural palaces, 32,000 clubs, 43,000 rural reading rooms, more than 300,000 public libraries, and about 80,000 sets of film equipment working, fully meeting the needs of the people's cultural life.

　　The Soviet people are now carrying out the great project of communist construction unprecedented in history. On the one hand, they are building projects such as the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, the Stalingrad Hydropower Station, and the Turkmen Main Canal; on the other hand, they are building protective forest networks covering 5.6 million hectares of land (each hectare is equal to 15 mu). In the great communist construction project, the Soviet people have begun to use atomic energy to benefit mankind.

　　The happy life of the Soviet people is the future prospect for our Chinese people. The friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is built on these common interests and common ideals. Therefore, this friendship is the most consolidated. In this Sino-Soviet Friendship Propaganda Week, everyone should clearly recognize these meanings.

### 为什么要举行中苏友好宣传周

专栏：宣传员讲话

    为什么要举行中苏友好宣传周
    今年二月十四日，是中苏友好同盟互助条约签订两周年的纪念日。中苏友好协会总会在去年十二月十八日就曾发出通知，号召全国各地围绕这个纪念日举行一次为期一周的中苏友好宣传。
    中国和苏联是世界上最大的两个国家，两国占有全世界人口的三分之一。两国的国土相连有一万几千里。两国人民很早就有了深厚的友谊。一九一七年伟大的十月革命成功不久之后，苏联政府就自动取消了在中国的一切特权，废除了沙皇俄国和旧中国政府订立的不平等条约。一九三七年抗日战争发生后，苏联借钱给中国，又派空军来帮助我国抗日。一九四五年八月，苏联出兵东北，歼灭了日本帝国主义的精锐部队关东军，迫使日本投降。一九四九年十月一日新中国成立后，苏联政府立即宣布和残余的国民党匪帮断绝关系，承认新中国，并和我国建立了外交关系。一九五零年二月十四日，又和我国签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约，中苏友好的关系更加巩固起来，中国人民有了一个强大的同盟国。
    这两年来，中苏两国人民的友谊更加增进了，全国现有二千零十八万多人参加了中苏友好协会。过去帝国主义和国民党反动派长期散布的反苏宣传的影响基本上肃清了。今天我们对中苏友好同盟的伟大意义，对社会主义国家的性质，对苏联建设的先进经验再作进一步的了解是有重大意义的。这是因为：
    第一、中苏友好同盟是巩固我们的祖国，保卫远东和世界和平的堡垒
    两年来，全国人民认真执行了毛主席“联合苏联、联合各新民主国家、联合其他各国的无产阶级及广大人民”的指示。我们在抵抗美帝国主义侵略方面取得了伟大的胜利，我们的志愿军和朝鲜人民军在一起，一年多消灭了敌人五十万人，迫使美帝国主义不得不和我们在朝鲜举行停战谈判，把美帝国主义的侵略计划打乱了，美国统治集团内部也发生了争吵。去年春天，麦克阿瑟在朝鲜吃了大败仗之后，就主张立即轰炸中国、使用蒋匪军参加作战，并且封锁中国的海岸。杜鲁门、艾奇逊之流心里也想这么做，可是还不敢动手。这是因为他们一方面惧怕中国人民力量的强大；另方面是因为中苏友好同盟互助条约的存在，他们惧怕苏联出来帮助中国。当时的美国国防部长马歇尔曾经说：“如果苏联干涉的危险不存在的话，就会立即轰炸中共基地！”
    从这一点上，就可以看出中苏友好同盟互助条约对于保卫我们祖国的安全和保卫远东的和平是如何重要了。中苏两国的强大同盟已成为保卫世界和平的重要力量。
    第二、苏联的援助，是建设我们祖国的必要条件
    这两年来，在我们的国家建设工作中，苏联的援助，包括在建设经验方面的援助，帮助我们克服了许多困难。例如，苏联曾经借了一笔钱给我们，供给了我们大批工业建设的装备，并且派了大批专家到中国来帮助我们进行经济建设和文化教育建设。苏联的先进生产方法，也开始在我国广泛传播。比如，我们有许多工人学习了苏联的郭瓦廖夫工作法，大大提高了生产效率。著名的一九五一织布工作法，就是运用郭瓦廖夫方法总结我国先进织布工人工作特点得出来的。苏联金属高速度切削法的推行，使我们许多工厂里的机床效能提高了十倍以至三十倍。在铁道运输上，东北铁路工人学习苏联的榜样，推行了五百日车公里的运动；在调车、养路等方面也学习了苏联的先进经验。在煤矿工业里，我们学习了苏联的新式采煤法和矿坑保安法。在农业方面，我们学习了苏联的密植法、牧草轮种法等，同时还建立了一批用机器耕种的国营农场。在文化教育方面，苏联先进的教育思想和教育方法，在我国教育事业改革的工作中也发挥了很大的作用。在内蒙古等地防治鼠疫和牲畜口蹄疫的工作中，也得到了苏联的大力帮助。
    现在，全国人民正在大张旗鼓地进行反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动，进而开展大规模的爱国增产节约运动。这是我们加强抗美援朝和建设祖国的根本办法。在这方面，我们可以向苏联学习的经验更多。大家知道，苏联就是用增产节约的方法走上工业化的。苏联在战后五年计划期间，由减低成本而积累的资金，在整个国民经济中，约为
    一千六百亿卢布，约等于全部国民经济投资的百分之六十四；在工业中，约为一千二百亿卢布，约等于全部工业投资的四分之三。看看苏联的这些成绩，就为我们开展爱国增产节约运动百倍地增加了信心。
    第三、苏联人民的幸福生活，为我国人民指出了未来的远景
    我们知道，苏联人民是世界上最幸福的人民。他们已经消灭了剥削制度，建成了社会主义社会，并且正在向共产主义社会前进。苏联全国的工人、农民和知识分子用四年多的时间胜利完成了战后五年计划，生活正在迅速提高。比如，苏联的国民收入，一九四零年（卫国战争以前）比革命以前的一九
    一三年多了五倍，而一九五一年则超过了一九四零年百分之八十一。战后的四年多内，苏联曾经四次降低物价，前后使人民得益三千零十五亿卢布。苏联有大学生一百三十万，超过欧洲和亚洲所有资本主义国家大学生的总数。苏联劳动人民普遍享受到免费医疗、疾病津贴、养老保险和休假等利益。一九五一年苏联国家社会保险基金的拨款达二百一十一亿卢布。苏联工会就有将近一千二百个疗养机关。在苏联各地，有四千四百多个文化宫、三万二千个俱乐部、四万三千多个乡村阅览室、三十多万个大众图书馆和八万套左右电影设备在工作，充分地满足人民文化生活的需要。
    苏联人民现在正进行着史无前例的共产主义建设的伟大工程。一面建设古比雪夫水电站、斯大林格勒水电站、土库曼大运河等工程；一面建造包括五六百万公顷土地（每公顷等于十五市亩）的防护林网。在伟大的共产主义建设工程中，苏联人民已经开始利用原子能来造福于人类。
    苏联人民的幸福生活，就是我们中国人民未来的远景。中苏两国人民的友谊，就是建筑在这些共同的利益和共同的理想上面的。因此，这种友谊是最巩固的。在这次中苏友好宣传周中，大家都要把这些意义认识清楚。
