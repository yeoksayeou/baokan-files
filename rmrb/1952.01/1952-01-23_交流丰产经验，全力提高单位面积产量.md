The Labor Models of Xinxiang County, Pingyuan Province
    Guarantee a Total Grain Increase of 10 Million Jin in the County This Year
From December 4th to 9th last year, we, the 1,506 labor models of the county, held the county's labor model conference in the county seat. We discussed the issue of increasing production and practicing economy at the conference. The production level of most villages in our county has reached the level before the Anti-Japanese War, and some have even exceeded the level before the Anti-Japanese War. The yield per unit area is constantly increasing. Li Fashan's cotton field in Youfangdi Village, Fifth District, has harvested 410 jin of seed cotton per mu; Wang Xiyou of Liudi Village, Sixth District, harvested 465 jin of wheat per mu. Production has increased, but it is still far from our requirements. We unanimously expressed at the meeting that we would respond to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy with practical actions, and guarantee an increase of 10 million jin of grain in 1952.

    At this meeting, we elected 108 county-level labor models. Among them, four proposed to create a new record of producing 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu of cotton field in 1952. 704 of us want to increase production by about 37% based on 1951, and 27 mutual aid teams plan to increase production by about 28%.

Pingyuan Junxian Patriotic High-Yield Expert Sun Qiyun
    1.2 Mu of Paddy Field Yielded 1,500 Jin of Grain
    Sun Qiyun, a farmer from Junxian County, Pingyuan Province, harvested 720 jin of spring wheat, 640 jin of autumn millet, and 170 jin of sorghum from 1.2 mu of paddy field in 1951. The total annual grain yield was 1,530 jin. This is the highest record in Junxian County's high yield per unit area. His experience in achieving high yields is deep plowing, careful cultivation, and applying more fertilizer. When he planted sweet melons on this 1.2 mu of paddy field in 1950, he applied two carts of manure and two carts of livestock manure, which was a sufficient amount of fertilizer. He used a hoe to plow the land, turning the soil very deeply, and harrowed it four times. His land was prepared very carefully. He mastered the rule of "eight, ten, and three rains for wheat harvest" (meaning that when sowing wheat in August of the lunar calendar, there should be enough moisture; watering once in October to maintain sufficient moisture; and watering again in March of spring to ensure a good harvest). For millet, he mastered the rule of "one inch of hoeing for millet is better than applying fertilizer." He hoed three times consecutively when the soil surface just turned white after rain, so the millet seedlings grew very vigorously.

    At the Third Labor Model Conference in Junxian County, he was named a patriotic high-yield expert (he was also a model in cultivating land for military families) and received a yellow cow and prizes such as improved varieties and pesticides. Based on the high yield in 1951, he plans to increase grain production by another 150 jin this year.

Fujian Minhou County Old Farmer Lin Zhixin
    Each Mu of Paddy Field Yields More Than 1,500 Jin of Rice
    Lin Zhixin, a 52-year-old farmer in District 1 of Minhou County, Fujian Province, planted two mu of rice in 1951, with two harvests a year. The average yield per mu was 1,523 jin of early and late rice, which was 110% higher than the expected yield and more than 70% higher than the local average yield. The main reasons for the high yield of his rice fields are: diligent cultivation and attention to technology. He has rich experience in seed selection, fertilization, plowing and harrowing, and irrigation.

    Lin Zhixin is active in production, but his thinking is conservative. Because he was afraid of bearing more burdens, he never dared to tell the truth about his actual yield. In the autumn of 1951, when comparing crops, he was rated as the first high-yield household per unit area in the district and received a hoe and a bamboo hat as prizes. He also received a lot of education at the crop grower forum, gradually understood the idea, and eliminated concerns about bearing more burdens. Later, he was elected as a labor model and attended the county labor model conference. He has realized that organizing will further develop production and increase yields. After returning from the meeting, he joined the mutual aid team.

Pingyuan Province Shanxian County Labor Model Wang Xiugu
    Mastering Soil Properties, Applying Large Amounts of Fertilizer, Paying Attention to Seed Selection: 1.1 Mu Yielded More Than 1,000 Jin of Millet
    Wang Xiugu, a labor model from Wangjing Village, Shanxian County, Pingyuan Province, harvested 1,030 jin of millet from 1.1 mu of land (with three graves inside, occupying about six or seven li) in 1951. His experience in growing millet is: 1. Mastering soil properties to improve productivity. His 1.1 mu of land is alluvial soil, which is the best soil for growing millet. During the winter plowing in 1950, he plowed more than six inches deep. After the new year, he harrowed it four times. Five or six days before planting millet at the Beginning of Summer, he plowed and harrowed it six times again. He used meticulous plowing and harrowing methods to exert the soil's fertility and improve land productivity. 2. Applying a large amount of fertilizer and applying fertilizer in stages. There was a lot of base fertilizer on his millet field. After emergence, he applied part of the topdressing fertilizer and shallowly hoed it once. This allows the manure to gradually bury under the roots, making it easier for the millet to absorb. When the seedlings grew to two or three fingers high, he thinned the seedlings once, followed by applying topdressing fertilizer and deeply hoed it once. After that, he no longer deep hoed. He applied about 6,000 jin of fertilizer to this 1.1 mu of millet land. 3. Seed selection and seed dressing. He selected Qitou Huanggu, which is suitable for local planting, as seeds. Before sowing, he first soaked the seeds in warm water and then mixed them with stove ash. One jin of millet is mixed with ten liang of ash. This planting method allows the seedlings to emerge two days earlier and the emergence is very vigorous.

Liaoxi Jin County Farmer Zhang Yunhan
    Pay Attention to Fertilization to Increase Soil Fertility, Deep Plowing and Careful Cultivation: 8.4 Mu Yielded 8,300 Jin of Sorghum
    Zhang Yunhan, a farmer from Moutun Village, Jin County, Liaoxi Province, received 8.4 mu of land during the land reform (Northeast mu, one mu equals 1.5 city mu). The soil quality of his land was not good, and the annual yield was only 3,200 jin in total. Due to his hard work, the yield has been increasing year by year. In 1950, he harvested more than 4,700 jin of sorghum and 200 jin of seed cotton from these fields. In 1951, he harvested 8,300 jin of sorghum, exceeding the expected yield by more than 1.5 times. How did he achieve a yield of 8,300 jin? First of all, he applied more manure. After the land reform, he raised forty sheep, one large cow, and fed two pigs, accumulating a lot of manure. In 1951, a total of 150,000 jin of manure was applied to 8.4 mu of land. Increased soil fertility is the main reason for his increased yield. Secondly, deep plowing and careful cultivation. Every autumn and spring, he plowed the land once. Ten days before sowing, he scattered all the accumulated livestock manure on the land. When the seedlings grew two inches high, he began hoeing the land, followed by soil cultivation. He plowed deeper than others, and hoed and cultivated the soil more times and more carefully than others. Thirdly, he paid attention to seed selection and seed disinfection. He not only selected seeds from the plants in the field, but also carefully selected them again after harvesting at home, so the seeds were pure and good. When sowing, he also soaked and mixed the seeds for disinfection.

    At the county labor model conference in 1951, he was selected as a high-yield model. He plans to increase sorghum production by another 200 jin per mu this year.

Hunan Luxi Cotton Planting Model Yan Zhengfu
    Creating a New Record for Cotton Yield in Xiangxi Mountainous Areas: Implementing Close Planting Plan This Year to Produce More Than 700 Jin Per Mu
    Yan Zhengfu, a cotton planting model in Luxi County, Hunan Province, planted five mu of cotton in 1951. Among them, 1.7 mu had the highest yield, harvesting 540 jin of seed cotton, creating a new record for cotton yield per unit area in the mountainous areas of western Hunan. His main experiences in achieving high yields are as follows: 1. Improving soil quality. Mainly relying on adding more base fertilizer. 2. Deep plowing. He said, "Children want to be born from oneself, and the soil wants to be plowed deeply," because cotton is a deep-rooted crop, so he plowed the land to a depth of eight or nine inches. 3. Applying more base fertilizer and using topdressing fertilizer rationally, turning part of the fertilizer into the bottom of the soil to attract cotton roots to extend downward. The facts have proved that his cotton planting technology is good. When the first drought occurred in western Hunan, others could not sow cotton, but his cotton seedlings had already grown to five or six inches high. By the time the third drought occurred, others suffered the loss of "dry flowers," but his cotton had already formed bells and opened peaches.

    At the provincial labor model conference, Yan Zhengfu saw that Yang Tiancai, a famous cotton planting model in the province, made a plan to produce 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu in 1952, and his confidence increased. He made a plan to produce 720 jin of seed cotton per mu in 1952. Now he is accumulating a large amount of fertilizer and decided to learn Qu Yaoli's "close planting" method, changing the past cotton planting method of "two chi between rows and one chi five between plants" to "one chi eight between rows and one chi two between plants," planting 2,800 cotton plants per mu.

    Yan Zhengfu's high cotton yield has broken the traditional saying among the masses in western Hunan that mountainous areas are not suitable for planting cotton.

    交流丰产经验，全力提高单位面积产量
　　平原省新乡县全体劳动模范
    保证全县今年增产一千万斤粮食
    去年十二月四日到九日，我们一千五百零六个劳动模范，在县城举行了全县的劳动模范大会。我们在大会上讨论了增产节约的问题。我县大部分村的生产水平已达到抗日战争以前的水平，有的还超过了抗日战争前的水平。单位面积产量不断提高。五区油房堤村的李法山的棉田，每亩已收到四百一十斤籽棉；六区刘堤村王锡友一亩小麦收了四百六十五斤。生产是提高了，但距离我们的要求还远得很。我们在会上一致表示要用实际行动响应毛主席的增产节约的号召，保证在一九五二年增产一千万斤粮食。
    在这次会上，我们选出了一百零八个全县的劳动模范。其中四人提出，在一九五二年要创造每亩棉田产籽棉一千斤的新纪录。我们之中有七百零四人要在一九五一年的基础上增产约百分之三十七，还有二十七个互助组计划增产约百分之二十八。

　　平原浚县爱国丰产能手孙起运
    一亩二分水田收粮千五百斤
    平原浚县农民孙起运，一九五一年在一亩二分水田中，收获春麦七百二十斤，秋谷六百四十斤，高粱一百七十斤。全年共计收粮一千五百三十斤。这是浚县单位面积高产量中的最高纪录。他的丰产经验是深耕细作多上肥。他这一亩二分水地在一九五○年种甜瓜时，上了二车大粪，二车牲畜粪，肥料很足。他用镢头刨地，翻土很深，又耙了四遍。他的地是整理得很精细的。他掌握了“麦收八、十、三场雨”的规律，（意思是说，农历八月耩麦时要有足够的墒，十月浇一水保持充足水分，春三月再浇一水，就可保证丰收。）对于谷子，他掌握了“谷锄一寸强似上粪”的规律，在雨后地皮刚发白时，连锄三遍，因此谷苗长得很旺。
    在浚县第三届劳动模范大会上，他被评为爱国丰产能手（他同时是替军属代耕中的模范），得了一头黄牛和若干优良品种、农药等奖品。他计划在一九五一年丰产的基础上，今年还要增产一百五十斤粮食。

　　福建闽侯县老农林志新
    每亩水田产稻千五百多斤
    福建闽候县一区有个五十二岁的老农民林志新，他在一九五一年种了二亩水稻，一年二熟，平均每亩共收早晚稻一千五百二十三斤，比应产量高出百分之一百一十，比当地一般产量高出百分之七十多。他的稻田丰产的主要原因是：勤劳耕作，讲究技术。他在选种、上肥、犁耙、灌溉等方面，都有丰富的经验。
    林志新生产积极，但思想保守。他因为怕多负担，从来不敢说出真实产量。一九五一年秋季比庄稼时，他被评为全区第一个单位面积高产户，得到一把锄头、一个斗笠的奖品；在庄稼户座谈会上，他又受到许多教育，逐渐搞通了思想，消除了怕多负担的顾虑。后来他当选劳动模范，出席全县劳动模范大会，他已认识到组织起来更会发展生产，提高产量，开完会回来，就加入了互助组。

　　平原省单县劳动模范王秀谷
    掌握地性大量施肥注意选种一亩一分地产谷一千多斤
    平原省单县王井村劳动模范王秀谷，在一九五一年种了一亩一分谷（地内有坟三座，占地约六、七厘）收了一千零三十斤。他的种谷经验是：一、掌握土地性能，提高生产率。他的一亩一分地是淤积土壤，是种谷子最好的土质。一九五○年冬耕时，他犁了六寸多深；过年后又耙了四遍；在立夏种谷前五、六天，又犁、耙了六遍。他用精细耕耙的方法，发挥了地力，提高了土地的生产率。二、大量施肥和分期施肥。他的谷地上的基肥很多。出苗后，又施追肥一部，并浅锄一遍。这样可以使粪逐渐埋到根下，便于谷子吸收。苗长到二、三指高时，间苗一次，接着又施追肥，并深锄一遍。以后，就不再深锄了。他的这一亩一分谷地共施肥约六千斤。三、选种、拌种。他选用适合当地种植的齐头黄谷做种子。播种前，他先用温汤浸种，再拌灶灰。一斤谷拌十两灰。这样种法，可以早出苗两天，而且出苗很旺。
                                                   郭忠信
　　辽西锦县农民张云汉
    注意施肥增加地力深耕细作八亩四分地产高粱八千三百斤
    辽西锦县牟屯村农民张云汉，在土地改革时分到了八亩四分地（东北亩，一亩合市亩一亩半）。他的这些土地的土质并不好，常年产量总共只有三千二百斤。由于他努力耕作，产量已逐年提高。一九五○年他在这些地里收获四千七百多斤高粱和二百斤籽棉；一九五一年收获到八千三百斤高粱，超过应产量一倍半以上。他怎样达到了八千三百斤的产量呢？首先是多上粪。土地改革以后，他养了四十只羊，一头大牛，喂两口猪，积下了很多粪。一九五一年，八亩四分地一共上了十五万斤粪。地力增加了，这是他提高产量的主要原因。其次是深耕细作。每年秋天和春天，他要把地翻耕一次。在播种前十天，就把积下来的牲畜粪全部撒到地里，在小苗长出二寸高时，就开始锄地，接着就进行培土。他耕地比别人深，锄地培土次数比别人多，也比别人细致。再次，是他注意选种和实行种籽消毒。他不只在地里棵选种籽，收割到家还要精选一次，所以种籽又纯又好；播种时，他又把种籽泡拌，实行消毒。
    一九五一年全县劳动模范大会时，他被选为高额产量模范。他计划今年每亩地还要增产高粱二百斤。

　　湖南泸溪植棉模范严正福
    创造湘西山地植棉产量新纪录今年实行密植计划每亩产七百多斤
    湖南泸溪县植棉模范严正福在一九五一年种了五亩棉花，其中有一亩七分地产量最高，收获达五百四十斤籽棉，创造了湖南西部山地植棉单位面积产量的新纪录。他的丰产经验主要的有以下几点：一、改良土质。主要依靠多垫底肥。二、深耕。他说：“子要亲生，土要深耕”，因为棉花是深根作物，所以他把地耕到八、九寸深。三、多用基肥，合理使用追肥，把一部肥料翻入土底，吸引棉根向下伸长。事实证明了他的植棉技术是好的。当湘西第一次发生旱灾时，别人棉花不能下种，他的棉苗却已长到五、六寸高了，到第三次发生旱灾时，别人受到“干花”的损失，他的棉花已经成铃开桃了。
    严正福在省的劳动模范大会上，看见全省著名植棉模范杨天才订出一九五二年每亩要产籽棉一千斤的计划，他的信心增大了。他订出一九五二年每亩产籽棉七百二十斤的计划。现在他正在大量积肥，并决定学习曲耀离“密植”的办法，把过去“行距二尺，株距一尺五”的植棉办法，改为“行距一尺八，株距一尺二”，每亩植二千八百棵棉株。
    严正福的棉花丰产，已打破了湘西群众认为山地不好植棉的传统说法。
