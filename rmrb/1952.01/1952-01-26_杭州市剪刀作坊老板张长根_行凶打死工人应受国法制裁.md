    Hangzhou Scissor Workshop Owner Zhang Changgen
    Should Be Punished by National Law for Beating a Worker to Death
    Comrade Editor: Zhang Changgen, the owner of a scissor workshop in Hangzhou, brutally beat worker Chen Lianzhong to death. Chen Lianzhong was an organizer of the preparatory committee of the Scissor Industry Committee of the Hangzhou Handicraft Industry Union. Chen was usually active in his work, repeatedly opposing and preventing Zhang Changgen's abuse of apprentices, which made Zhang Changgen resent him. At 10 p.m. on January 11, Zhang Changgen took advantage of Chen Lianzhong's sleep and struck Chen's head four times with a four-jin iron hammer. After the assault, Zhang Changgen hurriedly took his household registration booklet and fled. When nearby residents heard the noise and rushed over, Chen Lianzhong had already fainted. Everyone immediately sent him to the Hangzhou Provincial Hospital. Despite emergency treatment, he died on the afternoon of the 12th due to a fractured skull and excessive bleeding from his head. Afterwards, workers from all industries in Hangzhou sent representatives to demand that the government severely punish the murderer.

    Editor's Note: The Hangzhou Municipal People's Government should immediately severely punish the murderer Zhang Changgen. The Hangzhou Municipal Trade Union should use this incident of rampant capitalist cruelty to workers to further enhance the fighting will of the working class and resolutely smash the bourgeoisie's attack. Local trade unions should conduct in-depth publicity and education among workers to raise the class consciousness of workers, especially shop assistants and workshop workers.

    杭州市剪刀作坊老板张长根
    行凶打死工人应受国法制裁
    编辑同志：杭州市剪刀作坊老板张长根行凶打死工人陈连仲。陈连仲是杭州市手工业工会剪刀业委员会筹备会的组织员。陈平时工作积极，一再反对和阻止张长根虐待学徒的行为，张长根因而怀恨在心。一月十一日晚十时，张长根趁陈连仲熟睡时，用四斤重的铁锤向陈的头部猛打四下。张长根行凶后，急忙带了户口簿往外潜逃。当时附近居民闻声赶到时，陈连仲已经昏过去了。大家立刻把他送到省立杭州医院。虽经急救，但因他的颅骨已被打碎，头部出血过多，终于在十二日下午不治身死。事后，杭州市各业工人纷纷派代表要求政府严惩凶犯。　　赵恩渊
    编者按：杭州市人民政府应立即严惩杀人凶手张长根。杭州市工会应通过奸商猖狂的残害工人的事件，更进一步地提高工人阶级的战斗意志，坚决粉碎资产阶级的进攻。当地工会应对工人进行深入的宣传教育，以提高工人，尤其是店员、作坊工人的阶级觉悟。
