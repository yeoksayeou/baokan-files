    Beijing Municipal Committee for Practicing Economy and Checking Up,
    Responding to Requests from Business Circles, Extends the Confession Deadline Four Times,
    Deciding to Suspend Inspections for Three Days Starting Today to Give Industrial and Commercial Households with Illegal Activities Such as Bribery and Tax Evasion Another Opportunity to Fully Confess
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] Liu Ren, Director of the Beijing Municipal Committee for Practicing Economy and Checking Up, convened a meeting last night (the 15th) with Fu Huating, Le Songsheng, and Pu Jiexiu, the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Sun Fuling and Li Yizan, the Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General, to discuss issues related to the inspection work in the industrial and commercial sectors. After comprehensively analyzing the situation since the 20th of last month, it was found that 21,748 industrial and commercial enterprises in Beijing had confessed and reported illegal activities such as bribery, tax evasion, tax avoidance, and embezzlement of state property. There are also 1,379 packages of reported materials being investigated. Many industrialists and businessmen are operating with peace of mind because they have already confessed, but some industrialists and businessmen are still gambling on luck, not confessing, and attempting to muddle through. However, they have also seen that the Municipal Committee for Practicing Economy and Checking Up has recently begun inspections vigorously and resolutely, and has arrested illegal merchants who refuse to confess. Knowing that they can no longer attempt to muddle through, they regret not confessing and are requesting the government to give them one last chance to confess. Based on this situation, the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce requested the Municipal Committee for Practicing Economy and Checking Up to postpone inspections and extend the confession deadline again. At the meeting, Director Liu Ren, in response to the request of the industrial and commercial sectors, decided to suspend inspections of the industrial and commercial sectors for three days, from the 16th to the 18th. During this period, inspections will continue for industrial and commercial households that are currently being inspected and individual households that need to be dealt with urgently, but inspections will be temporarily suspended for all other industrial and commercial households in the city.
    Director Liu Ren emphasized: Based on the inspection situation and existing materials from the past four days, it is proven that there are indeed many people in Beijing's industrial and commercial sectors who have engaged in illegal activities such as bribery, tax evasion, embezzlement of state property, shoddy workmanship and use of inferior materials, and theft of state economic intelligence. In order to give these people another opportunity to repent and rehabilitate themselves, the deadline is extended for another three days. However, this is the fourth extension, and all industrial and commercial enterprises with illegal activities should seize this opportunity to confess and account for their actions thoroughly and voluntarily, so as to avoid suffering the consequences.
    Leaders of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, such as Fu Huating, unanimously expressed their complete agreement and support for Director Liu Ren's opinions, and are prepared to further mobilize the industrial and commercial sectors to carry out the confession movement in a deeper and more widespread manner.　　　　　　(Yu Gu)

    北京市节约检查委员会
    应工商界请求四次延展坦白期限
    决定从今天起检查暂停三天再次给有行贿偷税等不法行为的工商户以充分坦白机会
    【本报讯】北京市节约检查委员会刘仁主任，昨（十五日）晚邀集北京市工商联合会正副主任委员傅华亭、乐松生、浦洁修及正副秘书长孙孚凌、李贻赞等开会，商讨关于工商界的检查工作问题。综合分析自上月二十日以来的情况，北京市工商界坦白检举有行贿、偷税、漏税、盗骗国家资财等非法行为者，已达二一七四八家，还有一三七九包检举材料正在清查中。很多工商业者因已坦白，放心营业，但有一部分工商业者抱着侥幸心理，尚不坦白，企图蒙混过关。但是他们又看到市节约检查委员会近日已雷厉风行地开始检查，并对于拒不坦白的不法商人加以逮捕，自知不能再图蒙混，后悔没有坦白，要求政府再予以最后坦白的机会。北京市工商联合会根据这种情况，提请市节约检查委员会暂缓检查，再行延展坦白期限。会上，刘仁主任应工商界的请求，决定自十六日起至十八日止，对工商界的检查暂停三天。在此期间内，除对正在进行检查的工商户及个别亟须处理的工商户仍继续检查外，对全市其他工商户，暂时停止检查。
    刘仁主任强调指出：根据过去四天检查情况和现有材料，证明北京市工商界中有行贿、偷税、盗骗国家资财、偷工减料和盗窃国家经济情报等不法行为的人确实不少。为了再一次给这些人以充分的悔过自新的机会，再行延期三日，但这已是第四次延期了，一切有不法行为的工商业者，应该抓紧这一时机，自动彻底坦白交代，以免自食恶果。
    工商联负责人傅华亭等在会上一致表示完全同意与拥护刘仁主任的意见，并准备立即在工商界中进一步进行动员，使工商界的坦白运动深入、普遍地开展起来。　　　　　　（于谷）
