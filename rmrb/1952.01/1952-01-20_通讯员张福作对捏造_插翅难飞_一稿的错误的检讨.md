    Correspondent Zhang Fuzuo's Self-Criticism Regarding the Fabrication of the "Nowhere to Flee" Article

    Editor's Note: The Northeast Railway Public Security Bureau's letter points out that the communication entitled "Nowhere to Flee" (a New China News Agency dispatch) published on the first page of this newspaper on May 24, 1951, was a fabrication by Zhang Fuzuo, a worker at the Changchun Railway, in an attempt to seek personal gain and reward. Zhang Fuzuo's behavior is extremely egregious. We are now publishing his self-criticism as follows:

    Last May, the New China News Agency published a fabricated article of mine, which caused a very bad influence. Now I make the following self-criticism:

    I am a grassroots correspondent for the Changchun Xinbao (Changchun New News), and the newspaper office trusts my writings and words very much. But what about me? I often speak carelessly and make wild statements. I even developed to the point of having no stance, disregarding all consequences, fabricating articles for my own honor, and deceiving the masses. My article undermined the work of the state. After reflection, I deeply realized the seriousness of this mistake. This is one of the greatest lessons of my life. Why did I do something that goes against the interests of the people? It is mainly because my individualistic heroic thinking was at play, wanting to show off in front of the masses, to be in the limelight, and to enhance my so-called "prestige" among the masses. Because of this, I disregarded all consequences and committed such a shameful act. This first created a false impression of the Party newspaper among the people, and also created a negative influence on the public security organs on this issue. The Party revoked my propagandist qualification, and the Communist Youth League gave me a punishment of suspending my membership for three months, which is entirely correct. When the public security comrades questioned me, I even tried to persist in my error, which was a mistake on top of a mistake. The comrades in the Public Security Section enlightened and helped me, enabling me to thoroughly recognize the seriousness of this mistake and deeply understand the harm this mistake caused to the people. I am still young, especially as a member of the Communist Youth League, and I am determined to correct this mistake, remember this lesson, and make up for the losses caused by this mistake by working hard and avoiding accidents and errors. I will definitely overcome the bad habit of speaking irresponsibly and be responsible to the people in every word and deed.

Zhang Fuzuo

    通讯员张福作对捏造“插翅难飞”一稿的错误的检讨
    编者按：东北铁路公安局来信指出：一九五一年五月二十四日本报第一版发表的一篇题为“插翅难飞”的通讯（为新华社通讯稿），是长春铁路工人张福作企图邀功请赏而捏造的假情况。张福作这种行为是十分恶劣的。现在把他的检讨刊登如下：
    去年五月，新华社发了我捏造的一篇稿子，造成很坏的影响。现在我检讨如下：
    我是长春新报基干通讯员，报社对我写的稿子和说的话是很信任的。而我呢？常常信口开河，随便乱说，我甚至发展到毫无立场，不顾一切影响，为了自己的荣誉，假造稿子，欺骗群众。我这篇稿子对国家的工作起了破坏作用。经过反省，我深刻地认识了这个错误的严重性。这是我平生最大的教训之一。我为什么会作出这样违背人民利益的事呢？主要是我的个人英雄主义思想作怪，想在群众面前显示自己，出出风头，在群众中提高自己所谓的“威信”。正因为这样，我便不顾一切影响，作出了这样一件可耻已极的事情。这首先给党报在人民群众当中造成不真实的印象；也给公安机关在这个问题上造成不良的影响。党取消了我的宣传员资格，团给我停止团籍三个月的处分，这是十分正确的。当公安同志问我的时候，我还一度想坚持错误，实在是错上加错。公安段同志启发和帮助了我，使我彻底认识了这个错误的严重性，也深深体会到这个错误对人民的危害。我还是青年，尤其是一个团员，我下决心改正这种错误，牢记这个教训，以努力工作，不出事故差错，来补救这个错误造成的损失。我一定克服掉说话不负责任的坏习惯，作到一举一动对人民负责。  张福作
