To the Editorial Department: The leading cadres of the Lingshan County Grain Bureau in Guangxi Province have a serious problem with bureaucratic work style, leading to the spoilage of a large amount of grain, resulting in alarming losses. According to incomplete statistics, the stored grain in six grain depots under Lingshan County, namely Shitan, Pingshan, Datangpo, Longyaotang, Pingnantang, and Wuli, has suffered from heating, insect infestation, and mold, reaching over 5.57 million jin, of which more than 2.2 million jin are most severely damaged. The grain that is heating up, infested with insects, and sprouting has deteriorated and changed in taste, with the highest grain temperature exceeding the warehouse temperature by 14 degrees Celsius (the safe standard is that the difference between grain temperature and warehouse temperature should not exceed 5 degrees Celsius). The reasons for the grain heating, insect infestation, and mold include poor grain depot equipment and excessive grain stacking, but more importantly, the leading cadres have a bureaucratic work style and are not responsible for their work. Su Xianliu, the director of the county's Grain Bureau, usually does not pay attention to grain storage work and does not go deep to understand the situation below. Even after discovering the serious spoilage of grain, he remained indifferent. He emphasized being "busy with work" and "busy with learning," and used objective difficulties as an excuse to push the responsibility to higher authorities, without actively trying to salvage the situation. Such a bureaucratic work style, showing no concern for the serious losses suffered by state property, is truly intolerable!

In order to reduce the loss of this batch of grain, the Guangxi Provincial Grain Bureau, in addition to issuing emergency instructions for rescue measures, also transferred 20 strong cadres to form a rescue inspection team, led personally by Xu Zhengwen, the deputy director of the Provincial Grain Bureau, to conduct on-site inspections in Lingshan County on January 2 and to organize vigorous rescue efforts to strive to reduce the loss of state property.

    广西省灵山县粮食局
    领导干部官僚主义霉坏粮食五百多万斤
    编辑同志：广西省灵山县粮食局领导干部官僚主义作风严重，霉坏大批粮食，造成了惊人的损失。据不完全统计：灵山县所属石塘、平山、大塘坡、龙窑塘、平南塘、武利等六个粮食仓库的存粮，发热、生虫和霉烂的已达五百五十七万多斤，其中有二百二十多万斤损害最严重。发热、生虫、生芽的粮食已经变质、变味，最高粮温已超过仓温摄氏十四度（安全标准，粮温和仓温相差不过五度）。粮食发热、生虫和霉烂的原因，除粮仓设备不好，粮食堆积过高外，更重要的是领导干部有官僚主义作风，对工作不负责任。这个县的粮食局局长苏显柳，平常不重视保管粮食工作，不深入了解下边情况。到发现粮食霉坏的严重情况后，还是漠不关心。他强调“工作忙”，强调“学习忙”，并藉口客观困难多，把责任推到上级，而不积极设法抢救。像这种对国家财产遭受严重损失而丝毫无动于衷的官僚主义作风，实在是令人不能容忍的！
    广西省粮食局为了减少这批粮食的损失，除紧急指示抢救办法外，并抽调强有力的干部二十人，组织抢救检查组，由省粮食局副局长徐正文同志亲自率领，在一月二日前往灵山县实地检查，并组织大力抢救，以争取减少国家财产的损失。
