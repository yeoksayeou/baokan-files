The Shanghai Grain Company of the China Grain Company has a large amount of Northeast japonica rice in storage. Due to the excessive storage time, most of it has changed in taste and color, and a small portion has become sour and inedible. The state property has therefore suffered huge losses.

As early as the end of 1949, Northeast China transported 130 million jin of japonica rice to Shanghai to support the city. After this batch of japonica rice arrived, it was uniformly managed and kept by the East China District Company of the China Grain Company. However, because it contained a lot of moisture and the weather turned warmer, some of it began to heat up in March 1950. At that time, the District Company launched a comprehensive grain protection campaign. Through careful baking and vigorous promotion, most of the grain was saved from mold and spoilage, and 56 million jin were successively sold off. The remaining 74 million jin were transferred to the Municipal Grain Company for disposal in January 1951, when the Municipal Grain Company was established. At the beginning of the acceptance, the Municipal Company also vigorously organized sales and achieved certain results. From January to September, a total of 63 million jin were sold, accounting for more than 85 percent of the remaining total. However, since September, due to the complacency of cadres at all levels of the company (especially the leading cadres) with their existing achievements, they believed that the sales work was nearing completion and relaxed their work, with the result that 11.8 million jin of deteriorated Northeast japonica rice remained in storage until now.

The loss caused by the deterioration of this batch of edible rice due to stagnant storage is huge. Among them, 5.6 million jin that have changed in taste and color will be sold at a reduced price; 6.2 million jin that have become sour will be difficult to sell. It is estimated that the rice itself will lose 3.24 billion yuan. Due to the stagnant storage of this batch of rice, there are also serious losses in terms of warehouse rent, storage and tax fees, the occupation and loss of sacks, and the accumulation of funds.

The main reason for this loss is that the leading cadres of the Municipal Company do not cherish state property. They all mistakenly believed that 11.8 million jin of grain was a very small amount, and it would not matter if they did not find a way to sell it immediately. Their erroneous leadership thinking has greatly influenced the comrades responsible for storage work below. When the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce sent people to check whether there was any stagnant food on October 21, Li Xinyao, the leader of the warehouse group of the company's storage section, replied carelessly: "The promotion of old rice from 1949 is coming to an end."

The narrow and conservative management thinking of the company's leading comrades is also an important reason for this loss. In the spring of 1951, the East China District Company of the China Grain Company repeatedly notified the provincial and municipal companies to find ways to sell the old rice on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Company. At that time, the Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China Grain Company came to Shanghai to negotiate according to the notice of the District Company, requesting to handle it in the form of consignment sales, and specifically requested the Shanghai Municipal Company to calculate the profit and loss based on the regional price difference, freight and损耗. However, the several leading comrades of the Shanghai Municipal Company had different opinions. Some were prepared to agree, while others insisted on pricing according to the Shanghai market price regardless of the profit and loss of the Zhejiang Provincial Company; they even said that they would rather keep the batch of rice in the warehouse than sell it at a reduced price. At that time, individual comrades and warehouse workers within the company also put forward valuable suggestions for handling the old rice, but the leading cadres refused to adopt them. In this way, more than 10 million jin of grain have not been sold.

In the work of managing and storing this batch of grain, cadres at all levels of the Shanghai Municipal Company (especially the leading cadres) showed a serious bureaucratic work style. Before the Bureau of Industry and Commerce conducted an on-site inspection on October 23, 1951, many cadres of the company believed that only a "small amount" of the stagnant Northeast japonica rice remained. But when the inspection comrades found that 14 million jin were still in storage on the books and considered the situation serious, they were taken aback. So, the various departments shirked their responsibilities to each other: the storage section believed that selling grain was the business of the management section and had nothing to do with them; the management section said that the storage section had not told them that such a large batch of grain was stored in the warehouse, so they did not know at all. The top leaders of the company were even more unaware of this situation.

It is a serious waste to keep millions of jin of grain in the warehouse for one year and eight months, causing it to deteriorate and turn sour. The leading cadres of the Shanghai Grain Company should conduct a public review, promptly dispose of the old rice, and educate all cadres to do their work well. The relevant leading departments should also find out the responsibility and deal with this incident sternly.

### 上海市粮食公司领导干部有严重官僚主义作风  一千多万斤粳米发霉造成巨大损失

    上海市粮食公司领导干部有严重官僚主义作风
    一千多万斤粳米发霉造成巨大损失
    中国粮食公司上海市公司仓库中，积存大量东北粳米。由于积存时间过长，其中大部分已经味色俱变，小部分已发酸不能食用。国家财产因而遭受了巨大损失。
    远在一九四九年年底，东北地区为了支援上海，曾先后运到上海粳米一亿三千万斤。这批粳米运到后，就由中国粮食公司华东区公司统一掌握保管。但因为所含水分较多，而且天气转暖，所以在一九五○年三月间，就有部分发热。当时区公司曾全面开展护粮运动，经过细心烘焙和大力推销，使大部分粮食得免于霉坏，并且陆续出清了五千六百万斤。剩余下来的七千四百万斤，在一九五一年一月市粮食公司成立时，由区公司全部移交给市公司处理。市公司在接受之初，也曾大力组织推销并有了一定的成绩，一月到九月，共销出六千三百万斤，占剩余总量的百分之八十五强。但自九月份以后，由于这个公司各级干部（特别是领导干部）普遍地自满于既有成绩，认为推销工作已经接近完成，放松了工作，以致至今仍有一千一百八十万斤已经变质的东北粳米呆存在仓库里。
    这批食米因呆存变质而招致的损失是巨大的，其中五百六十万斤味色俱变的，将降价出售；已发酸的六百二十万斤，已不易推销出去。估计，单食米本身就要损失三十二亿四千万元。因这批食米呆存，在栈租、保管及税捐等费方面，在占用麻袋及麻袋损耗方面，在积压资金方面，也有严重的损失。
    造成这种损失的主要原因是市公司领导干部不爱护国家资财。他们都错误地认为一千一百八十万斤粮食是一个很小的数目，不立即设法推销也不要紧。他们这种错误的领导思想，对下面负责保管工作的同志影响很大。十月二十一日市工商局派人去检查是不是有食米呆存的情况时，公司保管科仓库组组长李欣耀就曾满不在乎地答称：“一九四九年陈米推销已到尾声。”
    这个公司的领导同志的狭隘保守的经营思想，也是造成这一损失的重要原因。一九五一年春季，中国粮食公司华东区公司曾一再通知各省市公司设法代上海市公司推销陈米。当时中国粮食公司浙江省公司就曾根据区公司的通知来上海接洽，要求以代销方式处理，并具体要求上海市公司就地区差价、运费及损耗，计算损益。但上海市公司的几位领导同志思想不统一，有的准备答应，有的却坚持要按上海市价作价而不管浙江省公司的盈亏；甚至表示宁愿把这批米呆存在仓库中，也不肯贬价出售。当时公司内部也有个别同志及仓库工人提出处理陈米的宝贵意见，但领导干部却拒不采纳。就这样使一千多万斤粮食一直没有被推销出去。
    在经营及保管这批粮食的工作中，上海市公司各级干部（特别是领导干部）表现了严重的官僚主义作风。一九五一年十月二十三日工商局进行实地检查以前，这个公司的许多干部都认为呆存的东北粳米只剩下了一个“尾数”。但等到检查同志在账面上翻出还呆存一千四百万斤并认为情况严重时，他们才大吃一惊。于是各个部门就相互推卸责任：保管科认为推销粮食是经营科的事，与他们无关；经营科则表示保管科没有及时告诉他们仓库中还存着这样大一批粮食，所以他们根本就不知道。这个公司的上层领导同志对这种情形就更不清楚了。
    使一千几百万斤粮食在仓库中呆存一年零八个月而变质发酸，是严重的浪费行为。上海市粮食公司的领导干部应进行公开的检讨，并及时处理陈米，教育全体干部，把工作做好。有关领导部门并应查清责任，对这个事件加以严正的处理。
