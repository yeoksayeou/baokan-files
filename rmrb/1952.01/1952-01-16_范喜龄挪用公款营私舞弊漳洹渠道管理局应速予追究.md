Fan Xiling, an accountant at the Zhang Huan Canal Bureau in Pingyuan Province, joined the workforce in 1950 with the aim of speculation and fortune. He abused his authority to steal large amounts of property, attempting to satisfy his personal desires and then leave the revolution to enjoy life at home. In less than a year, he embezzled a total of 45.16 million yuan in public funds five times (including 33.56 million yuan withdrawn from the bank using deposit slips at any time), 157 jin of millet, and 400 jin of grain. He also colluded with private merchants to engage in speculative production in Hankou, Shanghai, Shanxi, and other places, from which he profited 4.5 million yuan. On one occasion, he used the excuse of taking leave to go home, and left his post without permission, exceeding his leave by thirteen days, to sell goods at a private commercial firm in Anyang City.

The bureau's leadership failed to notice the severity of Fan Xiling's problem. He was away from work for many days, engaged in speculative production, but no serious investigation or punishment was carried out. This serious bureaucratic style must be corrected immediately, and Fan Xiling's corruption problem must be dealt with immediately.

    范喜龄挪用公款营私舞弊漳洹渠道管理局应速予追究
    平原省漳洹渠道管理局会计范喜龄，在一九五○年，就抱着投机发财的目的，参加工作。他利用职权，大量窃取财物，企图满足私欲后，脱离革命回家享受。不到一年，他先后五次挪用公款四千五百一十六万元（其中三千三百五十六万是用存款单据随时从银行支取的），小米一百五十七斤，谷子四百斤。他又勾结私商，到汉口、上海、山西等地进行投机生产，从中渔利四百五十万元。其中一次用请假回家为名，擅自脱离职位，超假十三天，往安阳市私人商行售货。
    范喜龄的问题发展到如此严重程度，局的领导干部竟没有发觉。他脱离工作多日，进行投机生产，也没有认真加以追究处理。这种严重的官僚主义作风，必须立刻纠正，范喜龄的贪污问题，必须立刻处理。  安阳专署人民监察处
