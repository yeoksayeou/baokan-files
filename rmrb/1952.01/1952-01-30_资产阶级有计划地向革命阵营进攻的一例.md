An Example of the Bourgeoisie's Planned Offensive Against the Revolutionary Camp
    Zhu Bo
    In the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, many facts have already demonstrated that the bourgeoisie has launched a rampant offensive against the revolutionary camp in the past three years; yet some people still don't believe it. They say: the bourgeoisie has neither a strong organization nor an army, how can it attack the revolutionary camp? For these doubters (or defenders of the bourgeoisie's illegal activities), I would like to present the following fact to them. This is just one case out of thousands.
    On January 24th, I visited a cadre who was hit by the bourgeoisie's "sugar-coated bullets" - Sun Jianguo, Deputy Director of the Supply Department of the General Logistics Department of the Central People's Revolutionary Military Commission. Sun Jianguo said to me with deep sorrow: "I am a person who has betrayed the class and the people. I am no longer a servant of the people, but a criminal who endangers the interests of the people. I have no other thoughts now, I just want to expose how the bourgeoisie dragged me down and their crimes of stealing state wealth, so that people can see all the despicable and shameless means by which the bourgeoisie attacks revolutionary cadres, so as to guard against them in the future." With tears in his eyes, he recounted his past and how he was captured by the bourgeoisie.
    Sun Jianguo joined the revolution in 1938. He served as a cultural instructor, platoon leader, battalion commander, and regimental chief of staff in the People's Liberation Army. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, Sun Jianguo was always a very heroic revolutionary fighter. He was nicknamed Sun Erhu. In 1948, during the Liaoshen Campaign, his intestines were broken by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops. Later, after many treatments, dog intestines were eventually grafted, and his anus still often discharges stool. At that time, in order to take care of his health, the higher authorities allocated 20 million Northeast currency for him to recuperate.
    In January 1949, while recuperating in Meihe County, Sun Jianguo met a businessman named Wang Ling. Wang Ling, knowing that he was an old cadre, thought that his opportunity to make a fortune had arrived. Wang Ling feigned sympathy for Sun Jianguo and said, "Your health is so bad that you can't participate in labor. Although you have some money, what if you run out of it? It's better to do some business and make a long-term plan." Sun Jianguo believed Wang Ling's words and, together with Wang Ling, established a "Dazhong Oil Mill" in Changchun.
    After Wang Ling achieved his first goal, he wanted to further use Sun Jianguo to cover up his illegal smuggling activities. He discussed it with several other businessmen, wanting to lure Sun Jianguo with inviting him to see operas and visit prostitutes. However, Sun Jianguo refused every time. Sun Jianguo did not even leave the gate of the Dazhong Oil Mill and lived a very simple life. He expressed great dissatisfaction with the behavior of Wang Ling and other businessmen in often seeing operas and visiting prostitutes, which made these businessmen feel very棘手. In order to entice Sun Jianguo to go out, Wang Ling and others later came up with another method, which was to persuade Sun Jianguo to become a traveling merchant. They said to Sun Jianguo, "Traveling merchants make more money than stationary merchants, so you should go out and move around." In this way, Sun Jianguo went out. But he still only did business and did not do anything illegal.
    In June 1949, Wang Ling introduced Sun Jianguo to an even more vicious profiteer - Zhou Hongen, the manager of "Hongda Firm" in Shenyang. They discussed having Sun Jianguo transport iron from the Northeast to Tianjin to sell, saying that this could make a lot of money. But Sun Jianguo knew that this was smuggling and resolutely refused to do it. The profiteers saw that Sun Jianguo was very firm and felt that he was difficult to deal with. Zhou Hongen said, "Don't be afraid! As long as we have many methods, we don't have to worry about him not taking the bait." Then, Zhou Hongen found several profiteers in Changchun and jointly investigated Sun Jianguo's past and reviewed the lessons learned from their failed attacks on Sun Jianguo. Later, they decided on a way to deal with Sun Jianguo, which was to start with ideological attacks first.
    As soon as Zhou Hongen and others met Sun Jianguo, they said: You really deserve to be an old cadre! Even though you have started doing business, your life is still so difficult! Once, Zhou Hongen, with a sincere look on his face, said to Sun Jianguo, "Revolutionary soldiers, especially old cadres like you, should live a very difficult life in order to become models for the masses. But your health is so bad, how can you continue like this? Your intestines have been grafted with dog intestines, and who knows when they will break, which will take your life. Now that the revolution has been victorious, it would be a waste to die without enjoying some happiness." Zhou Hongen's "ideological offensive" finally worked. Sun Jianguo began to waver. He thought: "Zhou Hongen is right! My health is so bad, who knows when I'll be finished. If I don't enjoy a few days of happiness, it would be a waste to die!" Zhou Hongen saw that Sun Jianguo was wavering, so he launched a series of pre-planned offensives. First, he invited him to dinner, baths, and operas; then he pulled Sun Jianguo to eat with female waiters and go to dance halls. Sun Jianguo said: "Eating with female waiters and going to dance halls would be embarrassing if acquaintances saw me." Zhou Hongen said: "It doesn't matter, it's not that coincidental! If you meet your acquaintances or the police, just say that the woman is my wife. Moreover, this is not corruption, it's just a visit. It won't tarnish you!"
    Sun Jianguo became more and more deeply involved. But he still did not engage in smuggling business. Zhou Hongen then found prostitutes to entice him. Zhou Hongen said: "This is just playing the game, no one who is often active outside can be so clean." Sun Jianguo was unwilling. He then said: "You are really feudal! You are still an old revolutionary!" Sun Jianguo resolutely refused to go. Zhou Hongen soon came up with a new trick. He said to Sun Jianguo: "I have a relative who is very beautiful and can write and calculate, and can be a good assistant to you." Sun Jianguo was confused and agreed. A day or two later, Zhou Hongen brought over a prostitute named Guo Yulan, whom he had hired in advance. He vacated a good house in his home and let Sun Jianguo and the prostitute live there. Zhou Hongen said shamelessly: "You two can sleep peacefully. If the household registration check comes, I will say that you two are my relatives." After saying this, Zhou Hongen smiled, showing his teeth, and closed the door and left. This prostitute was not just a simple prostitute, but Zhou Hongen's assistant. She often told Sun Jianguo how good Zhou was and how he was a true friend. She often advised Sun Jianguo to cooperate with Zhou Hongen. She reported Sun Jianguo's every move to Zhou Hongen every day.
    Sun Jianguo was thus captured by profiteers like Zhou Hongen. After that, Zhou Hongen openly proposed to Sun Jianguo to engage in smuggling. The method was for Sun Jianguo to take the lead. Zhou Hongen said to Sun Jianguo: "You are an old cadre and a veteran. Even if the government finds out, it doesn't matter." Sun Jianguo had a disease in his heart and dared not refuse Zhou Hongen's request, and finally started smuggling business with profiteers like Zhou Hongen.
    In this way, profiteers like Zhou Hongen were satisfied. They regarded Sun Jianguo as a treasure. When Sun Jianguo took out a cigarette, they rushed to light it for him. When Sun Jianguo took a bath, they prepared his shirt early. Their "care" for Sun Jianguo in life was truly meticulous. They smuggled a total of 900 tons of iron to Tianjin and earned 3 billion Northeast currency. This criminal activity only stopped when their illegal activities were discovered by the Shenyang Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, which confiscated most of the money they had earned.
    In October 1950, Sun Jianguo came to Tianjin from the Northeast, preparing to return to his original unit. As soon as he arrived in Tianjin, he met Li Xiaozhi, a profiteer who had helped sell iron during smuggling in the past, who was then the business director of "Wujin Native Produce Trading Company" (private). In order to steal state property, Li Xiaozhi immediately left "Wujin Native Produce Trading Company" and spent all day messing around with Sun Jianguo. He said to Sun Jianguo: "You are like my old superior. I will definitely have a way out by following you." He wanted to introduce Sun Jianguo to a woman, saying:
    "I have a cousin who is very beautiful, but she doesn't get along with her husband, so I plan to introduce her to you." Sun Jianguo did not agree. Later, he said: "Linji Foreign Firm has a big business, but it lacks talented business personnel. I hope you can cooperate with them." Li Xiaozhi led Sun Jianguo to visit Linji Foreign Firm. After Sun Jianguo saw the building of Linji Foreign Firm and the seventy or eighty employees, Li Xiaozhi said:
    "This is the head office, and there is also a branch in Beijing, which is about the same size as here." Sun Jianguo saw that the foreign firm was not small in scale, so he readily agreed to become the assistant manager of Linji Foreign Firm and signed a one-year contract, stipulating that 40% of the net profit earned by Linji Foreign Firm in the future would belong to Sun Jianguo.
    In this way, Sun Jianguo completely fell into the trap of the merchants. At that time, those who were often with him, in addition to Yang Qingyu, the general manager of Linji Foreign Firm, Feng Guoying, the deputy general manager, and Bao Mingzhi and Li Fangyu, the managers of the branch, there were also dozens of big merchants such as Zhang Nairu, Shen Erchang, Song Qingyou, Hei Jingsheng, Bian Yumin, and Wang Dazheng. These merchants all united to launch an offensive against Sun Jianguo. They could immediately know Sun Jianguo's every move. Wang Dazheng found prostitutes for Sun Jianguo, Bian Yumin sent Sun Jianguo an "Omega" watch and a Parker 51-type pen, and often invited Sun Jianguo to dance halls and eat with "female waiters." They knew whether he wanted to drink water or eat fruit just by looking at the table.
    In April 1951, Sun Jianguo found Luo Wen, who he had worked with in the past (then the director of the Planning Department of the General Logistics Department). Through Luo Wen's introduction, he became the deputy director of the Supply Department of the General Logistics Department.
    After that, the profiteers surrounded him like a swarm of flies. When he went to Guangzhou to organize an office last September, profiteers Bian Yumin, Wang Dazheng and others accompanied him. Bao Mingzhi, Wang Hongdu and others also bought gifts to see him off. When Sun Jianguo arrived at Tianjin Station, thirty or forty managers and owners of merchants such as Linji Foreign Firm, Lianmao, New World, and Taifeng in Tianjin were waiting at the station to see him off. After arriving in Shanghai and staying at the International Hotel, three or four merchants went to the International Hotel to greet him. Later, Bian Yumin, Wang Dazheng and others accompanied Sun Jianguo to Hangzhou West Lake for sightseeing. When he arrived in Guangzhou, profiteers Hei Jingsheng and others had already hired a car to wait at the station.
    Surrounded by this group of profiteers, Sun Jianguo helped the profiteers do speculative business. Linji Foreign Firm wanted Sun Jianguo to come forward and say that there were 100 trucks to be sold to the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission, for a total price of 11 billion yuan. The contract stipulated that the goods would be delivered in two months, but they were not delivered even after two months, and Linji Foreign Firm cheated 2.6 billion yuan (including commissions, war risk insurance fees, and four months of interest on 11 billion yuan). In this transaction, Sun Jianguo divided 150 million yuan of Linji Foreign Firm's commission (which has now been returned). In another instance, profiteers Bian Yumin, Gao Zhengshou and others asked Sun Jianguo to be an intermediary to sell 200,000 sacks to the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission. Sun Jianguo received a commission of 60 million yuan. In addition, he helped the "New Da Building Materials Firm" and "New Middle Building Materials Firm" in Tianjin, as well as merchants in Shanghai and Guangzhou, sell asphalt to the Barracks Management Department of the General Logistics Department, dividing the commission money of 25 million yuan. In addition, he helped many private merchants do some business. In these transactions, I don't know how much state property was lost.
    After the bourgeoisie captured Sun Jianguo, it further launched a comprehensive offensive against the Supply Department. Through Sun Jianguo's introduction, the profiteer Li Xiaozhi entered the Supply Department as a staff member. He often cheated in the name of the Supply Department and colluded with private merchants to steal state property. More than 20 other merchants also entered the Supply Department and became "cadres," accounting for the majority of the more than 30 staff members in the Supply Department (the rest were five or six cadres transferred from the troops), making the Supply Department a smoky place, becoming an agency specializing in eating, drinking, and messing around with profiteers. The losses caused to the state here are incalculable.
    The bourgeoisie's rampant offensive has thus completely changed the nature of the Supply Department.

    资产阶级有计划地向革命阵营进攻的一例
    朱波
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争中，很多事实已经说明，资产阶级在三年以来，对革命阵营进行了猖狂的进攻；但有些人还不相信。他们说：资产阶级既没有坚强的组织，又没有军队，怎能向革命阵营进攻呢？对于这些怀疑者（或资产阶级非法行为的辩护者），我愿意举出下面的一件事实给他们看。这，只是千百件中的一件罢了。
    一月二十四日，我访问了一个被资产阶级的“糖衣炮弹”击中了的干部——中央人民革命军事委员会后勤部供应处副主任孙建国。孙建国沉痛地对我说：“我是背叛了阶级和人民的人。我已经不是人民的勤务员，而是一个危害人民利益的罪人。我现在已经没有其他想法，只想把资产阶级如何拖我下水、以及他们盗窃国家财富的罪行，全部揭露出来，让人们看一看资产阶级向革命干部进攻的一切卑鄙无耻的手段，好在今后加以戒备。”他流着眼泪，叙述了自己的过去和被资产阶级俘掳的经过。
    孙建国是一九三八年参加革命的。曾任人民解放军文化教员、连指导员、营长、团参谋长等职。在抗日战争中，在人民解放战争中，孙建国一直都是一个很英勇的革命战士。外号孙二虎。一九四八年在辽沈战役中，被蒋匪军打断了肠子。后来经过多方治疗，最后接了狗肠子，至今肛门仍经常流大便。当时，上级为了照顾他的身体，拨了两千万元东北币要他休养。
    一九四九年一月孙建国在梅河县休养时，认识了一个叫王龄的商人。王龄获知他是老干部，就认为自己发财的机会到了。王龄假惺惺地对孙建国表示同情，说：“你身体这样坏，是不能参加劳动的。虽然有几个钱，可是吃光了怎么办？倒不如做个生意，作一个长远打算。”孙建国信了王龄的话，就和王龄一起，在长春成立了一个“大众油坊”。
    王龄的第一个目的达到以后，就想进一步利用孙建国掩护自己做非法的走私活动。他和另外几个商人商量好，想用请看戏、嫖妓女来引诱孙建国。但是，每次都被孙建国拒绝了。孙建国连大众油坊的大门都不出，生活也非常朴素。他对王龄等商人经常看戏、嫖妓女的行为表示很不满，使这几个商人感到很棘手。为着引诱孙建国出门，王龄等后来又想出另一办法，就是劝孙建国干行商。他们对孙建国说：“座商不如行商赚钱，还是出去活动活动吧。”孙建国就这样出门了。但他仍然只是做买卖，不做违法的事。
    一九四九年六月，王龄给孙建国介绍了一个手段更毒辣的奸商——沈阳“鸿大行”经理周鸿恩。他们商量着要孙建国从东北运铁到天津去卖，说这样可以赚很多的钱。但孙建国知道这是走私，坚决不干。奸商看到孙建国很坚定，都觉得不好对付。周鸿恩说：“不怕！只要办法多，不怕他不上钩。”接着，周鸿恩就找了长春的几个奸商，共同调查孙建国的过去，检讨自己向孙建国进攻失败的教训。以后，他们决定了对付孙建国的办法，就是先从思想进攻开始。
    周鸿恩等一见孙建国的面就说：你真不愧是一个老干部！虽然做起生意来了，生活还是这么艰苦！有一次，周鸿恩装着一副诚恳的面孔对孙建国说：“革命军人，特别是像你这样的老干部，生活上应该很艰苦，这样才能成为群众的模范。但是，你的身体这样坏，这样下去怎么能行呢？你的肠子接了狗肠子，说不定什么时候断了，就要你的命。现在革命胜利了，再不享点福，死了才冤枉哩。”周鸿恩的“思想进攻”终于起了作用。孙建国开始摇幌起来。他想：“周鸿恩说的对呀！身体这样坏，说不定那天完蛋哩。如果不享几天福，死了多冤枉！”周鸿恩看见孙建国动摇了，就展开预先计划好的一连串的攻势。先是请吃饭、洗澡、看戏；进一步就拉孙建国去吃女招待，进跳舞厅。孙建国说：“吃女招待，进跳舞厅，叫熟人看见多丢人。”周鸿恩说：“不要紧，那里就赶得那么巧！如果遇见你的熟人或警察，就说那女人是我的老婆。而且，这也不是腐化，这不过是参观参观。沾不脏你的！”
    孙建国越陷越深了。但他还是不干走私生意。周鸿恩就又找妓女来引诱他。周鸿恩说：“这是逢场作戏，常在外面活动的人，谁也不能那么干净。”孙建国不愿意。他又说：“你这个人真封建！亏你还是个老革命哩！”孙建国坚决不去。周鸿恩不久又想出新花样。他对孙建国说：“我有一个亲戚，长得很漂亮，又能写会算，可以给你当一个很好的助手。”孙建国被迷惑了，就答应下来。过了一两天，周鸿恩就把预先花钱雇好的一个名叫郭玉兰的妓女领来了。他把自己家里一座好房子腾出来，让给孙建国和妓女住宿。周鸿恩无耻地说：“你俩放心睡觉吧。查户口的来了，我就说你俩是我的亲戚。”说完以后，周鸿恩露着牙笑了一笑，就关上门子走了。这个妓女并不只是单纯的妓女，而是周鸿恩的助手。她时常对孙建国说姓周的如何如何好，如何如何够朋友。时常劝说孙建国和周鸿恩合作。她把孙建国的一举一动，每天向周鸿恩做报告。
    孙建国就这样被周鸿恩等奸商俘掳了。这以后，周鸿恩就公开向孙建国提出要走私。办法是由孙建国出头干。周鸿恩对孙建国说：“你是老干部，又是荣誉军人。政府就是发觉了，也不要紧。”孙建国心里有了病，不敢不答应周鸿恩的要求，终于和周鸿恩等奸商一起作起了走私生意。
    这样一来，周鸿恩等奸商都满意了。他们把孙建国当成宝贝一样看待。孙建国一拿出纸烟来，他们就抢着给点火。孙建国洗澡时，他们就把衬衣早早给准备好。生活上对孙建国的“照顾”，真是无微不至。他们总共私运了九百吨铁到天津，赚了三十亿元东北币。一直到他们的非法行为被沈阳市人民政府公安局发觉，把他们赚的钱大部没收，才停止了这一罪恶活动。
    一九五○年十月，孙建国从东北来天津，准备回到原部队去。一到天津，就遇见过去走私时帮助卖铁的奸商李孝直，他当时是“武进土产贸易行”（私营）的业务主任。为了盗窃国家的财产，李孝直马上脱离了“武进土产贸易行”，带着孙建国整天鬼混。他对孙建国说：“你就像我的老上级一样。我跟着你一定有出路。”他要给孙建国介绍女人，说：
    “我有一个表妹，长得是十分人材，就是和她丈夫合不来，我打算给你介绍一下。”孙建国没有答应。以后他又说：“临记洋行是大买卖，就是缺少有才干的业务人员。我希望你能和他们合作。”李孝直领着孙建国到临记洋行去参观。孙建国看到临记洋行的大楼和七、八十个工作人员之后，李孝直又说：
    “这是总行，北京还有一个分行，规模和这里差不多。”孙建国看到这个洋行规模不小，就一口答应下来，担任了临记洋行的协理，并订了一年的合同，规定临记洋行以后成交所得的纯利百分之四十归孙建国。
    这样一来，孙建国完全堕入了商人的圈套。当时经常和他在一起的，除临记洋行的总经理杨晴宇、副总经理冯国英和分行经理鲍明之、李芳玉以外，还有大商人张乃如、沈尔昌、宋庆友、黑静生、边裕民、王大正等数十人。这些商人都联合起来，对孙建国实行进攻。孙建国的一举一动，他们都能马上知道。王大正给孙建国找妓女，边裕民给孙建国送“奥美卡”手表和五一型派克钢笔，还经常邀孙建国去跳舞厅，吃“女招待”。孙建国向桌子上看一眼，他们就知道是要喝水或者吃水果。
    一九五一年四月，孙建国找到了过去一起工作的罗文（当时是军委后勤部计划处长）。经罗文介绍，他到后勤部供应处担任了副主任。
    这以后，奸商们更像一群苍蝇似的围绕着他。去年九月他到广州去组织办事处时，奸商边裕民、王大正等都陪同前往。鲍明之、王洪度等也买了礼物来送行。孙建国到达天津车站时，天津的临记洋行、联贸、新大陆、泰丰等商号的经理、东家等三、四十人都在车站上等着欢送。到上海后住在国际饭店，又有三、四个商人前往国际饭店问候。以后，边裕民、王大正等又陪着孙建国到杭州西湖去游玩。到广州时，奸商黑静生等早已雇好小汽车在车站上等候着。
    孙建国处在这伙奸商的包围之中，就帮助奸商做投机生意。临记洋行要孙建国出面，说有一百部卡车要卖给军委后勤部，共价一百一十亿元。合同上规定两个月交货，结果过期两个月也没有运来，被临记洋行骗走二十六亿元（包括佣金、兵险费和一百一十亿元的四个月利息等）。这次生意，孙建国分了临记洋行一亿五千万元的佣金（现在都退出来了）。另一次，奸商边裕民、高征寿等请孙建国当介绍人，卖给军委后勤部二十万条麻袋。孙建国分到佣金六千万元。另外帮助天津“新大建筑材料行”、“新中建筑材料行”及上海、广州的商人卖给后勤部营房管理部沥青，分佣钱二千五百万元。此外，还帮助很多私商作了些买卖。在这些买卖中，国家财产损失了不知多少。
    资产阶级俘掳了孙建国以后，更进一步向供应处全面进攻。奸商李孝直经过孙建国的介绍，打进供应处当了工作人员。他经常以供应处的名义在外吹骗，和私商勾结起来盗窃国家财产。另有二十多个商人，也都打入供应处，当了“干部”，在供应处三十多个工作人员中占了多数（其余是五、六个从部队调来的干部），把供应处弄得乌烟瘴气，成了专门和奸商吃喝鬼混的机关。这里给国家造成的损失是无法计算的。
    资产阶级的猖狂进攻，就这样使供应处完全变质了。
