　　Workers are Enthusiastic after Reading the Newspaper to Fight Corruption; Station Master Passively Resists and Does Not Take the Lead in Self-Examination
　　Comrade Editor: The struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is unfolding vigorously throughout the country. The twenty-eight reading groups at our Xibianmen Transportation Station of the Beijing Transportation Company are also active in this movement. At the beginning of the movement, the masses were not very enthusiastic. Everyone was unclear about what was going on, only knowing that leaders raising their voices and glaring were considered bureaucratic. Everyone knew that corruption and waste should be opposed, but they didn't know how to oppose them. The newspaper readers launched publicity campaigns aimed at these incorrect perceptions. Taking the major corruption case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, secretaries of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee, as an example, they explained the People's Government's determination to thoroughly eliminate corrupt elements. Comrade Chen Yongzhong of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions led us in holding two general meetings, making everyone realize that this is a struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology, and stipulated that the newspaper reading groups should use the "Thought Talks" column of the Workers' Daily as the main material for daily study. After study and discussion, everyone truly recognized the significance of the movement and knew that in this struggle, Chairman Mao was backing everyone up, and we would definitely win. Now our workers are carrying out this movement with great enthusiasm. Some activists in the reading groups have even composed allegro, cartoons, and big-character posters to strengthen the firepower of the struggle. Our transportation station master, Li Qichun, has serious bureaucratic work styles. He did not mobilize everyone well, only held a general meeting of all employees on January 8th, and perfunctorily reviewed himself, with a very insincere attitude. He only said that he had committed bureaucracy, and that more than 1,300 workers were injured while working (due to the lack of lighting equipment during night transport, which was later resolved by the Municipal Labor Bureau); he attributed the misappropriation of public funds and embezzlement of more than 40,000 yuan (we say it's more than this) to liberalism. After the meeting, the workers reflected that he was not being honest, but rather "lecturing" everyone.
　　Some time ago, when the trade union leadership group discussed how to launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the workers had many opinions, but they did not dare to "open fire" on the administrative leaders. The newspaper readers then, based on Vice Chairman Liu Ningyi's speech at the National Federation of Trade Unions' Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Conference and the news of the heads of various agencies personally "going to the front line" published in the newspaper, conducted publicity to the workers, dispelled everyone's concerns, and enabled the workers to dare to report corrupt elements. The newspaper reading groups took the lead in writing wall newspapers and allegro, directly criticizing the leaders. Such as "Station Master Li, truly praiseworthy, his bureaucratic airs are truly great, he doesn't care about workers getting injured, he sleeps in the corridor at night, the work is a complete mess, the workers are fighting all day long," etc.; and established a reporting agency to enable illiterate workers to also report problems. The newspaper reading groups enlarged and posted the cartoons "Rats Overturning the Granary" and "Hooking Corruption" from the People's Daily, and drew several cartoons based on our specific situation here. Corrupt element Liu Xirui said: "I didn't plan to confess in the past, but when I saw the big-character posters and cartoons on the wall, I panicked, and I didn't dare to read the newspaper anymore. After clarifying the problem, my heart was at ease. If it weren't for Chairman Mao calling for the 'Three Antis' now, in another six months, I would have embezzled more, and my life would have been in danger."
　　Comrade Editor: We workers now have an opinion: Our transportation station master Li Qichun is the director of the frugality inspection committee, but he does not respond to the problems raised by the workers. The workers reported that Zeng Guangzhi, the captain of the first transport team, was retaliating because someone had reported him (the workers used allegro to expose his bureaucracy, and he cursed people), but Station Master Li did not deal with this matter. He also said: "It is not easy to cultivate a cadre." Comrade Chen Yongzhong of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions asked him to make a profound self-criticism, but he said: "I am not ready yet." Up to now, our trade union has grasped a "corruption and bureaucracy" account book with everyone's reports on eleven administrative cadres, including 54 cases of corruption and 80 cases of bureaucratic work styles. We hope that Station Master Li will quickly take the lead in confessing and examining himself.

　　Newspapers Guided Our Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement
　　Comrade Editor: Reading and studying newspapers effectively promoted our cooperative's anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.
　　On December 24th of last year, our agency began the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. It should be said that our United Cooperative Director Comrade Zheng Jinlong attaches importance to this movement. He personally mobilized, arranged work, investigated, researched, and grasped the situation. However, his thinking was not clear, and he did not know where the key to carrying out this movement lay. At this time, the movement remained at the level of group meetings and individual talks, and the masses were not mobilized.
　　On January 4th, the People's Daily published the editorial "In the Great Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy, Where Lies the Key to Mobilizing the Masses?" This editorial pointed out the direction and method for us to carry out the movement. The Newspaper Reading and Study Committee immediately organized 25 newspaper reading groups throughout the agency to seriously study this editorial. This study was very rewarding. First of all, the leading cadres corrected their timid and hesitant leadership methods of not daring to let go and mobilize the masses. On January 6th, United Cooperative Director Comrade Zheng Jinlong convened a general meeting of all personnel, took the lead in making self-criticism, mobilized the masses to raise opinions, and warned the corrupt elements, urging them to quickly confess to the masses and strive for meritorious service to atone for their crimes. Under the influence of the leading cadres taking the lead, leading cadres at all levels made self-criticisms in front of the masses, which enlightened and educated the masses. In addition to the development of newspaper reading and study, the ideological concerns of the masses were gradually dispelled. Up to now, more than 30 people have reported corrupt elements who attempted to hide. Zhu Huanian, the director of the First Coal Plant, had received bribes from the former plant director Wang Baoyin. He was not clean himself, so he did not dare to report Wang's corrupt behavior. He was afraid of being punished himself and afraid of hurting the other party's feelings. Corrupt element Wang Baoyin took advantage of his loophole and threatened him repeatedly. Zhu Huanian fell into his trap and dared not report him. After reading and studying the newspaper, Zhu Huanian finally confessed his problems in tears and reported Wang Baoyin's corruption crimes.
　　The masses were mobilized, and the corrupt elements panicked. We have already discovered three relatively large corrupt elements who originally refused to confess. Comrades, according to the spirit of the newspaper, repeatedly explained to them the principle of heavier punishment for refusing to confess. At the same time, the mass reporting movement has been launched, and now two of them have begun to confess to the masses. The general corrupt elements have also learned a truth in the study, that is, what the editorial said, "The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government and its Military Commission, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, are resolutely leading and supporting this just mass struggle." Therefore, many people have taken the initiative to confess. Tian Zhenfu, the chief of the finance and accounting section, is a person with unclean hands. In 1949, he embezzled 450,000 yuan when he bought a bicycle for the public; in 1950, when he was the director of the Tenth District Cooperative, he also embezzled 280,000 yuan. However, he couldn't let go of his "chief" airs, and he didn't want to confess at the beginning of the movement. This study made him realize, and he confessed his corrupt behavior to the masses. The movement is still developing in depth.

　　读报组活动
    北京运输公司西便门运输站
    工人读报后热火朝天反贪污站长消极抵抗不带头检查
    编辑同志：全国各地大张旗鼓地展开了反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的斗争。我们北京运输公司西便门运输站二十八个读报组，也在这个运动中活跃起来了。在运动刚开始的时候，群众很不起劲。大家都摸不清是怎么回事，只知道领导人说话瞪眼，就算官僚作风；大家都知道贪污浪费应当反，可是不知道怎样反法。读报员针对这些不正确的认识，展开了宣传。以天津地委书记刘青山、张子善的大贪污案为例子，说明了人民政府彻底肃清贪污分子的决心。市总工会陈用中同志领导我们开了二次大会，使大家认识到这是一个无产阶级思想与资产阶级思想的斗争，并规定读报组每天以工人日报“学时事”栏的思想漫谈为学习的主要材料。经过学习和讨论，大家真正认识到运动的意义，知道在这个斗争里，有毛主席给大家撑腰，一定会打胜仗。现在我们工人对这个运动已经搞得热火朝天了，某些读报组的积极分子还编了快板、漫画、大字报，加强斗争的火力。我们运输站站长李启春，有严重的官僚主义作风。他没有很好地发动大家，仅仅在一月八日开了一个全体职工大会，潦潦草草地检讨了一下自己，态度很不老实。他只说自己犯了官僚主义，有一千三百多工人在工作时受了伤（因为夜间搬运时缺乏照明设备，后经市劳动局解决）；他把挪用公款和贪污四万多元（我们说不止此数）的事情，都说成是自由主义。会后，工人反映说，他这不是坦白，而是给大家“训话”。
    前些时，当工会领导小组讨论如何开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动时，工人意见很多，但是不敢向行政领导人“开火”。读报员便根据报纸上刊出的刘宁一副主席在全国总工会反贪污反浪费反官僚主义大会上的讲话，及各机关首长亲自“上前线”的消息，向工人进行宣传，打消了大家的顾虑，使工人敢于检举贪污分子。读报组带头编写墙报、快板，直接批评领导人。像“李站长，真可夸，官僚架子真叫大，工人受伤你不管，夜班睡在廊底下，工作搞得一团糟，工人成天在打架”等等；并成立检举代书处，使不识字的工人也能反映问题。读报组把人民日报上的“耗子倒囤”和“钩贪污”等漫画，放大了贴出来，又根据我们这里的具体情况，画了几张漫画。贪污分子刘锡瑞说：“我过去不打算坦白，但一看到墙上贴的大字报、漫画，我就发慌，报纸也不敢看了。把问题说清楚了以后，心就安了。要不是毛主席现在号召搞‘三反’，再过半年，我贪污得多了，命就难保了。”
    编辑同志：我们工人现在有个意见：我们运输站站长李启春，是节约检查委员会的主任，但他对工人提出的问题，不给答复。工人反映搬运第一中队长曾广志因别人检举他，有报复行为（工人用快板揭发他官僚主义，他就骂人），李站长对此事不加处理。他还说：“培养一个干部可不容易。”市总工会陈用中同志要他作深刻检讨，他却说：“我还没有准备好。”到现在为止，我们工会掌握了大家检举十一个行政干部的一本“贪污官僚”账，其中包括贪污五十四件，官僚作风八十件，我们希望李站长赶快亲自带头坦白和检讨。

    报纸指导了我们的反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动
    编辑同志：读报学习有效地推进了我们合作社的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。
    去年十二月二十四日，我们机关就开始了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。应该说，我们联社主任郑金龙同志是重视这一运动的。他亲自动员、布置工作，调查研究和掌握情况。但是，他的思想不明确，他不知道开展这个运动的关键在那里。这时的运动停留在小组会和个别谈话上，没有把群众发动起来。
    一月四日，人民日报发表了“在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争中，发动群众的关键何在？”的社论。这篇社论，给我们指出了开展运动的方针和方法。读报学习委员会立刻组织全社二十五个读报组，认真学习这篇社论。这一学习收获很大。首先是领导干部纠正了小手小脚、不敢放手发动群众的领导方法。一月六日，联社主任郑金龙同志召开了全社人员大会，带头检讨，发动群众提意见，并对贪污分子提出警告，要他们迅速向群众交代，争取戴罪立功。在首长带头的影响下，各级领导干部都在群众面前作了检讨，使群众受到了启发和教育。再加上读报学习的开展，群众的思想顾虑逐渐解除了。到现在为止，已有三十多个人检举了企图隐瞒的贪污分子。第一煤厂厂长朱华年，曾受过前任厂长王宝银的贿赂。他自己手上不干净，所以也不敢检举王的贪污行为。他怕自己受处分，怕伤了对方的感情。贪污分子王宝银钻了他的空子，两次三番地威胁他。朱华年上了他的圈套，不敢检举了。经过读报学习，朱华年终于痛哭流涕地坦白了自己的问题，检举了王宝银的贪污罪行。
    群众发动起来了，贪污分子着了慌。我们已经发现的三个比较大的贪污分子，原来都是拒不坦白的。同志们根据报纸的精神，一再地向他们说明拒不坦白要加重处分的道理，同时，群众性的检举运动已经展开，现在其中的两个已开始向群众交代。一般的贪污分子在学习中，也学到了一个真理，那就是社论上说的“以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央和中央人民政府及其军事委员会，是坚决领导和支持这种正义的群众斗争的。”因而不少人已主动地坦白。财务会计科长田真复，是一个手上不干净的人。一九四九年他给公家买自行车时，贪污了四十五万元；一九五○年在十区合作社当主任时，也曾贪污过二十八万元。但是，他放不下科长的“架子”，在运动开始的时候，他不想坦白。经过这次学习，使他醒悟过来，他就把自己的贪污行为向群众交代了。运动仍在深入开展中。
