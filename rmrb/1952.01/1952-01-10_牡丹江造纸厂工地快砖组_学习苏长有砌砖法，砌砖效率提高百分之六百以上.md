    Mudanjiang Paper Mill Construction Site Quick Brick Team:
    Learning Su Changyou's Bricklaying Method, Bricklaying Efficiency Increased by More Than 600 Percent

    Comrade Editor: After the Quick Brick Team at the Mudanjiang Paper Mill construction site learned Su Changyou's bricklaying method, bricklaying efficiency increased by an average of more than 600 percent. Team leader Zhang Ruiji had been skeptical ever since he heard that Su Changyou's team could lay 1,900 bricks per person per day: his own team only laid 900 bricks per person per day, how could they lay so fast? On September 25, 1951, the Songjiang Provincial People's Government Basic Construction Committee summoned bricklayer representatives from Mudanjiang to visit Su Changyou's bricklaying method in Harbin. The on-site leading cadres at the factory told Zhang Ruiji to go and see. He saw that the advantage of Su Changyou's team's bricklaying method was: the team's labor force was rationally divided, reducing the non-technical labor of the skilled workers. After returning to the factory, he and the factory's technicians studied the strengths of Su Changyou's work method, and also studied new supplementary methods. He led the whole team to study and discuss the new work method, so that everyone had a correct understanding of the advanced operation method. On October 7, his team implemented a scientific division of labor. On the 8th, they began to use the new work method to lay bricks, and the average was 2,150 bricks per person on the first day. But they were not complacent, and then launched a bricklaying competition, creating a new record. Now, this team averages 5,958 bricks per person per day (based on nine hours), with a maximum of 7,491 bricks, an increase in work efficiency of more than 600 percent.

    牡丹江造纸厂工地快砖组
    学习苏长有砌砖法，砌砖效率提高百分之六百以上
    编辑同志：牡丹江造纸厂工地快砖组学习苏长有砌砖法后，砌砖效率平均提高百分之六百多。组长张瑞吉听到苏长有小组一人一天能砌一千九百块砖的消息以后，心里就一直怀疑：自己组里一人一天才砌九百块，他们能砌得这么快？一九五一年九月二十五日，松江省人民政府基本建设委员会召集牡丹江瓦工代表到哈尔滨参观苏长有砌砖法。厂里现场领导干部叫张瑞吉去参观。他看到苏长有小组砌砖法的优点是：小组的劳动力合理分工，减去了技术工人的非技术劳动。他回厂后，和厂里技术人员研究苏长有工作法的长处，又研究了新的补充方法。他领导全组学习和讨论新的工作方法，使大家对于先进操作法有了正确的认识。十月七日，他们组里实行了科学的分工。八日开始运用新的工作方法砌砖，第一天平均每人砌砖二千一百五十块。但他们并不自满，接着发起砌砖竞赛，创造了新的纪录。现在，这个组每人每天（以九小时计算）平均一般砌砖五千九百五十八块，最高可砌七千四百九十一块，工作效率提高百分之六百以上。
