The Tianjin Daily published an editorial on the 16th entitled "Clear All Obstacles in the Struggle Against Bribery, Tax Evasion, and Fraudulent Seizure of State Property." The editorial exposed the various means by which illegal industrialists and businessmen were resisting this struggle, and pointed out that any elements who dared to resist must be given a crushing blow.

The anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-fraudulent seizure of state property struggle in Tianjin has achieved certain results. As of the editorial's publication, employees and workers had reported over 10,000 cases of illegal merchants' bribery, tax evasion, and other illegal acts. Some industrialists and businessmen had already recognized and confessed their wrongdoings, taking a positive leading role. Many industrialists and businessmen who had made some mistakes had also begun to confess and expressed their determination to reform. Others, whose mistakes were more serious, were also beginning to awaken and were willing to confess and repent. However, many illegal merchants were still using various means to resist and refused to confess, becoming a serious obstacle to further progress in this struggle.

One method is open resistance. Some illegal merchants, despite repeated education and mobilization by the People's Government, not only refuse to honestly confess and sincerely repent, but instead adopt open resistance to undermine the confession and denunciation movement. For example, the奸商 (jian shang - traitorous merchant) Liu Zongshan had bribed Wang Jianfu, a cadre of the Municipal Public Property Management Bureau, on several occasions. He not only refused to confess, but repeatedly used threats to prevent Wang Jianfu from confessing. Some illegal merchants openly threatened workers with dismissal to prevent them from reporting. In one trade association's office, reactionary slogans such as "Bribery and acceptance of bribery establish an offensive and defensive alliance" and "Beware of third-party denunciations" were even openly posted. The editorial said: We should warn these illegal merchants that the power of the people is irresistible, and the People's Government has repeatedly stated the policy of "leniency for those who confess, and severe punishment for those who refuse to confess." If they regard the People's Government's policies as deceptive and insist on testing the law by taking the means of open resistance to undermine the confession and denunciation movement, they will inevitably be severely punished by the government. Liu Zongshan has now been arrested and prosecuted by the People's Court, which is a good lesson for them.

Another method is covert struggle. Some bribers and bribe-takers, or bribers and bribers, collude with each other and secretly form "offensive and defensive alliances." Individual industries even mutually agree: if we confess, we all confess together; if we don't confess, we all don't confess, and no one is allowed to come forward to report. Some illegal merchants, on the one hand, incite employees to report workers for "stealing," and on the other hand, incite workers to report employees for "corruption," while at the same time, they woo some backward elements and attack progressive elements, in order to divide the unity between workers and employees, so that they can "sit on the mountain and watch the tigers fight" and escape denunciation. Some even more despicable and shameless use "honey traps" or organize "labor-management protection committees" to win over employees and obstruct denunciation. The editorial pointed out: In fact, those who form "offensive and defensive alliances" are the most foolish people. As the saying goes, "You can't bury a dead body in the snow." If you don't say it, others will. Recent reports in the newspapers show that many "offensive and defensive alliances" cannot be maintained. Doesn't this illustrate this point? Therefore, we hope that these people will quickly dissolve their "alliances" and automatically and thoroughly confess. If they are denounced, the government will definitely impose heavier penalties. At the same time, we hope that the employees of all industries will be vigilant against the conspiracies and tricks of certain illegal elements who attempt to divide employee unity and evade denunciation, and expose and strike them in a timely manner. In addition, we hope that industrialists and businessmen will wage a resolute struggle against the small number of illegal elements who dare to resist and undermine (whether openly or covertly) the confession and denunciation movement, and implement a coordinated attack from within and without.

Taking advantage of loopholes is also a means used by some illegal elements. Some industrialists and businessmen, in the confession and denunciation movement, talk volubly and vaguely. Some have confessed, but only confess to small things and not big things, only confess to distant things and not recent things, and try to avoid the important and dwell on the trivial. There are also a few people with bad character who use "two-faced" tactics, pretending to be "active" on the one hand, mobilizing others to confess, while on the other hand, they do not say a word about their own bribery, tax evasion, and other illegal acts. In addition, many people still take a wait-and-see attitude, trying to muddle through. The editorial said: We should clearly tell these people that the era of taking advantage of loopholes is gone. Today, only by honestly expressing thorough confession and repentance to the people can they gain the trust of the people. All attempts to take advantage of loopholes are wrong, and a hesitant wait-and-see attitude is also incorrect.

Another method is to create rumors and sabotage. Some remaining special agents and saboteurs spread rumors, saying that "everyone has to confess," "the government won't let us eat good food now," "starting in 1952, the government will not allow perms, will not allow the use of toilet paper, and will not allow listening to radios," and so on. The editorial said: We should be vigilant against these rumor-mongering saboteurs. If we discover rumors, we should track them down, find the rumor-mongering saboteurs, and report them to the public security organs for arrest and prosecution. It is completely wrong and irresponsible to the people to not question various rumors and not refute various absurd arguments.

The editorial pointed out: The purpose of our opposition to corruption and waste and our advocacy of integrity and thrift is not to lower the current living standards of the general public. On the contrary, it is to gradually improve the living standards of the general public. The legitimate lifestyle of the general public should not be interfered with by any organization or individual. The people earn their due rewards with their labor, and they have the right to use the rewards they earn to spend on their daily legitimate lives. The same is true for industrialists and businessmen. If they want to smoke good cigarettes, wear good clothes, eat good food, get perms, put on makeup...they are completely free to do so, and no one should interfere without authorization.

The editorial emphasized: The struggle against bribery, tax evasion, and fraudulent seizure of state property is a serious class struggle. Therefore, all the people of our city, especially industrialists and businessmen, should act together and actively participate in this struggle in a fighting posture. However, the purpose of this struggle is different from the purpose of land reform. The latter aims to eliminate feudalism, eliminate the landlord class, and liberate rural productive forces, while the former is not to eliminate the bourgeoisie, but only to resolutely struggle against the bribery, tax evasion, and fraudulent seizure of state property of a part of the degenerate elements of the bourgeoisie, in order to protect state property, better develop production, and strengthen the country's economic construction. At the same time, through this struggle, the corrupt and decadent ideological influence of the bourgeoisie should be thoroughly eliminated within the revolutionary ranks, and all phenomena of corruption and waste and bureaucratic work styles should be thoroughly eliminated, in order to maintain the purity of the revolutionary ranks. Industrialists and businessmen can also further transform themselves through this struggle, so as to better develop their own businesses under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy. In addition, it is necessary to further establish a new atmosphere and new morality of diligence, thrift, and love for public property in society. Therefore, this struggle is not only beneficial to the general public, but also beneficial to legitimate industrialists and businessmen.

The editorial quoted Chairman Mao's analysis of the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie in "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" (December 1939), and cited historical facts to prove that this analysis is completely correct. The editorial said: We should firmly remember Chairman Mao's instructions, be vigilant against the dual nature of the Chinese national bourgeoisie, and at the same time, vigorously, swiftly, and on a large scale carry out the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, and fraudulent seizure of state property, in order to continue to help and promote the positive and progressive side of the national bourgeoisie, and vigorously transform and eliminate the dark and decadent side of the national bourgeoisie.

### 天津日报社论指出  必须粉碎不法商人抵抗反行贿斗争的诡计

    天津日报社论指出
    必须粉碎不法商人抵抗反行贿斗争的诡计
    天津日报在十六日发表题为“扫清反行贿、反偷税、反诈骗国家财产斗争中的一切障碍”的社论。这篇社论揭露了不法工商业者对抗这一斗争的种种手段，指出必须给予一切敢于抵抗的分子以粉碎性的打击。
    天津市的反行贿、反偷税、反诈骗国家财产的斗争已经有一定成绩。截至社论发表时为止，仅店员工人先后检举的有关不法商人行贿、偷税等犯法行为已达一万多件；有些工商业者已经首先认识和坦白了自己的错误行为，起了积极带头作用；不少犯过一些错误的工商业者也已陆续自动坦白，表示决心改过；另有一些错误比较严重的工商业者也开始觉悟，愿意坦白悔过。但是也还有不少不法商人仍采取种种手段进行顽抗，拒不坦白，成为进一步开展这一斗争的严重障碍。
    一种手段是公开抵抗。有些不法商人在人民政府的一再教育和动员下，不但不老实坦白，认真悔过；相反地，竟采取公开抵抗的手段来破坏坦白检举运动。如奸商刘宗珊过去曾多次向市公产管理局干部王健甫行贿，不仅拒不坦白，反而一再用威胁手段阻挠王健甫坦白。有些不法商人公开以解雇来威胁工人，不让检举；某同业公会办公室内甚至曾公开张贴“行贿与受贿建立攻守同盟”“小心第三者检举”等反动标语。社论说：我们应该警告这些不法商人，人民的力量是不可抗拒的，人民政府已经反复说明了“坦白者从轻发落、拒不坦白者依法严惩”的方针。如果他们视人民政府的政策为可欺，硬要以身试法，采取公开抵抗的手段来破坏坦白检举运动，那就必然要受到政府的严厉惩办。刘宗珊现在已由人民法院逮捕法办，这就是他们很好的教训。
    另一种手段是隐蔽斗争。有些行贿者和受贿者或行贿者和行贿者相互串通，秘密订立“攻守同盟”；个别行业甚至相互约定：要坦白一起坦白，要不坦白大家不坦白，禁止任何人出头检举。个别不法商人一面鼓动职员检举工人“偷窃”，一面鼓动工人检举职员“贪污”，同时拉拢一些落后分子，打击进步分子，借以分化工人和职员之间的团结，自己“坐山观虎斗”，逃避检举。有的更卑鄙无耻地使用“美人计”，或组织“劳资双方保护委员会”来拉拢职工，阻挠检举。社论指出：其实，订立“攻守同盟”的人是最愚蠢的人，俗话说“雪地里埋不了死人”。你不说别人会说，最近报上发表许多“攻守同盟”守不住的报道，难道还不能说明这一道理吗？因此，我们希望这些人还是赶快拆散“同盟”，自动彻底坦白，要是一旦被人检举，政府定要加重处分。同时我们希望各行业职工对于某些不法分子企图分化职工团结、逃避检举的阴谋诡计，必须提高警惕，并及时予以揭发、打击。此外，我们希望工商业者对于敢于抵抗、破坏（不论是明的或暗的）坦白检举运动的少数不法分子进行坚决的斗争，实行内外夹攻。
    投机取巧也是某些不法分子使用的手段。有些工商业者在坦白检举运动中，到处夸夸其谈，不着边际；有的虽然坦白了，但是只坦白小的不坦白大的，只坦白远的不坦白近的，处处避重就轻。还有个别品质恶劣的人更采取“两面派”手段，一面装作“积极”的姿态，动员别人坦白，一面对于自己行贿、偷税等犯法行为却一字不吐。此外，还有许多人至今还采取观望的态度，企图混过“关”去。社论说：我们应该明确地告诉这些人，投机取巧的时代已经一去不复返了，今天只有老老实实地向人民表示彻底坦白悔过，才能取得人民的信任；一切投机取巧的办法都是错误的，徘徊观望的态度也是不对的。
    还有一种手段是造谣破坏。有些残余的特务破坏分子造谣生非，说什么“人人都要坦白”，“现在政府不让吃好的了”，“一九五二年起政府不准烫发，不准使用手纸，不准听收音机了”等等。社论说：对于这些造谣破坏分子，我们应该提高警惕。发现谣言就应跟踪追击，找出造谣的破坏分子，报告公安机关逮捕究办。对于各种谣言不加追问，对于各种荒谬言论不予驳斥，那是对于人民不负责任的一种自由主义的态度，是完全错误的。
    社论指出：我们反对贪污浪费，提倡廉洁节约的目的，不是为了降低目前一般人民的生活水平，相反地，正是为了逐步提高一般人民的生活水平。目前一般人民的正当的生活方式，任何机关、个人无权加以干涉。人民以自己的劳动换得应得的报酬，人民就有权利以所得的报酬支配于日常正当的生活中去。对于工商业者也是一样。如果他们愿意抽好的纸烟，穿好的衣服，吃好的东西，烫烫头发，涂脂抹粉……完全听便，不得擅加干涉。
    社论强调指出：反行贿、反偷税、反诈骗国家资财的斗争，是一个严重的阶级斗争。因此，我们全市人民特别是工商业者，应该一致行动起来，以战斗的姿态积极参加这一斗争。但是这一斗争的目的不同于土地改革的目的，后者要达到消灭封建，消灭地主阶级，解放农村生产力；而前者并不是为了要消灭资产阶级，只是对于资产阶级中一部分败类的行贿、偷税、诈骗国家财产的犯法行为进行坚决的斗争，以保卫国家的资财，更好地发展生产，加强国家的经济建设。同时要通过这一斗争，在革命队伍的内部彻底肃清资产阶级腐化堕落的思想影响，彻底消灭一切贪污、浪费的现象和官僚主义的作风，以保持革命队伍内部的纯洁性。工商业者也可以通过这一斗争进一步改造自己，以便在工人阶级领导下，在国营经济领导下，更好地发展自己的事业。此外，就是要在社会上进一步树立勤俭、朴素、爱护公共财产的新风气、新道德。因此，这一斗争不仅对一般人民有利，对于正当的工商业者也是有利的。
    社论引证了毛主席在“中国革命与中国共产党”（一九三九年十二月）一文中对民族资产阶级的两重性的分析，并列举历史事实证明这一分析的完全正确。社论说：我们应该牢牢地记住毛主席的指示，对于中国民族资产阶级的两重性提高警惕，同时大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地、大规模地开展反行贿、反偷税、反诈骗国家财产的斗争，以便继续帮助与发扬民族资产阶级积极进步的一面，大力改造与消灭民族资产阶级黑暗腐朽的一面。（新华社）
