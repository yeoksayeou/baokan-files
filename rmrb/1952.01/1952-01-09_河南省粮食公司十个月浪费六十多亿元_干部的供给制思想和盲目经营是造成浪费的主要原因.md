    Henan Grain Company Wastes Over 6 Billion Yuan in Ten Months
    Cadres' Supply System Thinking and Blind Operation are the Main Causes of Waste
    In November 1951, the Henan Branch of the China Grain Company inspected its expenditure over the previous ten months and found that it had wasted more than 6.383 billion yuan. The waste mainly occurred in the following areas:
    (1) Blind allocation, resulting in reverse and roundabout transportation. According to the initial inspection by the provincial company alone, the loss amounted to more than 3.216 billion yuan. For example, the Huangchuan district is one of the rice-producing areas in Henan Province. However, the provincial grain company blindly believed that the local disaster situation was very serious, and in March 1951, it transferred a batch of rice from Hunan. By the time it was transferred, it was already the wheat harvesting season, and it could not be sold. The cost of transporting this batch of rice from Hunan to Xinyang accounted for 15% of the grain price. In other words, after this unreasonable transfer, only 85 jin of grain remained for every 100 jin. In August 1951, another 732,949 jin of grain were transferred to Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Luoyang, Shangqiu, and other places. The transportation, loading and unloading, weighing, escorting, storage, and interest expenses for the grain transferred from Huangchuan accounted for 78% of the total grain volume. Therefore, only 161,249 jin remained of the 732,949 jin of rice transferred.
    (2) In terms of storage, there was a lack of in-depth research to overcome difficulties such as insufficient warehouses and simple equipment. Most of the grain was not stored separately according to its quality and moisture content. Warehouse management personnel also did not study methods to prevent insect infestation and mildew. This resulted in significant losses. In the Luohe district alone, the loss of grain due to insect infestation was worth 24,958,300 yuan.
    (3) In warehouse construction, due to insufficient understanding of the contractor's construction capabilities and lax supervision, rework and shortening of the warehouse's lifespan occurred. For example, the construction of seven warehouses originally planned in the Xinyang Special Zone was delayed for five months. As a result, 22.24 million jin of grain had to be stored in the open air, requiring mats, ropes, dunnage, and handling expenses. In addition, due to natural losses caused by open-air storage, the total loss amounted to 778.79 million yuan.
    (4) Many accidents occurred, resulting in losses. In the past six months, fines were often imposed for delays in transportation, and there were cases of fraud. In terms of storage, there were accidents such as theft, rain damage, flooding, and warehouse collapse. Accidents were caused by the collapse of grain stacks due to insufficient care for workers. The total loss from accidents was more than 78.71 million yuan. In the past year, eighteen cases of corruption occurred, with a total of more than 9 million yuan being embezzled.
    (5) In terms of capital turnover, due to problems such as capital backlog, idleness, and slow remittances, interest losses alone amounted to 1,552,860,000 yuan from January to November 1951. For example, in early July, due to rain, procurement work could not be carried out, but the higher authorities were not promptly notified to stop the allocation of funds. An average of 33 billion yuan was backlogged every day for ten days, resulting in an interest loss of 165 million yuan.
    (6) Expenditures such as printing, postal and telecommunications, and entertainment expenses were wasted by 375,718,000 yuan due to lax systems and inadequate control. Among them, the waste of postal and telecommunications expenses was about 200 million yuan.
    (7) The losses in the purchase, storage, and transportation of equipment were also significant. For example, 100 units of 500 kg scales were purchased from the Beijing Metrology Instrument Factory of the Ministry of Light Industry, totaling 105 million yuan. This batch of scales was inaccurate and inflexible, and therefore could not be used, resulting in waste.
    The main reasons for the above serious losses are: First, there was insufficient understanding of production and sales, and the plan was divorced from reality. In the spring of 1951, a large amount of grain was transferred from Jiangnan, Shanxi, and the Northeast. After the grain was transferred, sales were not high, and it was then required to transfer a large amount of grain to North China. Later, grain prices gradually rose, and the grain company had no grain in storage. Second, most cadres did not establish the idea of economic accounting, did not conduct careful calculations in various tasks, and lacked the necessary systems.
    The Henan Grain Company proposed that in future work, it is necessary to overcome the supply system thinking, establish enterprise thinking, strengthen the investigation of production and sales, effectively control allocation, solve the problem of capital backlog, do a good job in storage and transportation management, and implement the economic accounting system.

    河南省粮食公司十个月浪费六十多亿元
    干部的供给制思想和盲目经营是造成浪费的主要原因
    中国粮食公司河南省公司一九五一年十一月份检查了十个月的费用支出情况，发现浪费了六十三亿八千三百八十二万多元。主要的是浪费在这几方面：
    （一）盲目调拨，发生倒运和迂回运输的现象。仅据省公司初步检查，损失数字就有三十二亿一千六百五十五万多元。如潢川区是河南省产米区之一；但省粮食公司盲目地认为当地灾情很重，一九五一年三月份从湖南调来一批大米。调到时已到麦收时节，销不出去。这批大米从湖南运到信阳，运费杂费开支就占粮价的百分之十五。也就是说，经过这次不合理的调运，每百斤粮食只剩八十五斤。一九五一年八月份又调出粮食七十三万二千九百四十九斤，分运郑州、开封、洛阳、商邱等地。从潢川调出的粮食，运输、装卸、过磅、押运、保管、利息等费用共占粮食总数的百分之七十八，因而调出的七十三万二千九百四十九斤大米只剩了十六万一千二百四十九斤。
    （二）在保管上，没有深入地钻研，克服仓库不足、设备简陋等困难。大部分粮食不按粮质好坏和所含水分的大小分别保存。仓库管理人员也不研究防止生虫霉烂的方法。这就造成很大的损失。只是漯河区因虫蚀损失的粮食就值二千四百九十五万八千三百元。
    （三）在仓库建设上，因对承包者的建设能力了解不够，监工也不严，发生返工重建或缩短了仓库寿命的现象。如信阳专区原计划建筑的七幢仓库，拖延五个月施工。因此，有二千二百四十万斤粮食不得不露天存放，需要席子、绳子、垫木和搬运费用；加上因露天存放而受自然损耗等原因，总计损失七亿七千八百七十九万元。
    （四）发生许多事故，造成了损失。半年来在调运上，常因延期被罚款，并有被诈骗的情形；在保管上发生过被盗、雨水浸湿、水淹、仓库倒塌等事故；因为对工人照顾不够，因粮垛倒塌造成事故。发生事故的总损失为七千八百七十一万多元。一年来贪污事件发生十八起，被贪污款项共九百多万元。
    （五）在资金周转上，因资金积压、闲散及汇拨迟缓等问题，一九五一年一月份到十一月份仅利息就损失了十五亿五千二百八十六万元。如七月上旬，因天雨不能进行收购工作，但没有及时报告上级停止拨款，十天之内平均每天积压三百三十亿元，利息损失就有一亿六千五百万元。
    （六）印刷、邮电、交际费等支出，由于制度不严，掌握不紧，浪费了三亿七千五百七十一万八千元。其中邮电费浪费了约二亿元。
    （七）在购置、储运器材中损失数字也很大。如买轻工业部北京度量衡制造厂五百公斤磅秤一百台，共一亿零五百万元，这批磅秤不准确、不灵活，因此不能用，造成浪费。
    造成以上严重损失的主要原因是：一、对产销情况了解不够，计划与实际脱节。一九五一年春季由江南、山西、东北调来大批粮食，调进后销量不大，又要求把大量粮食外调华北。后来粮价又渐上涨，粮食公司又库无存粮。二、一般干部没有树立起经济核算的思想，没在各种工作中进行精打细算，更缺乏必要的制度。
    河南省粮食公司提出，在今后工作中要克服供给制思想，树立企业化思想，加强产销情况的调查，切实掌握调拨，解决资金积压问题，作好储运保管工作，贯彻经济核算制。（简捷）
