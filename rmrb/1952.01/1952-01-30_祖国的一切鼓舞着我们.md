    Everything About the Motherland Inspires Us
    Xia Guang, Representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning from Korea
    The life of the Volunteer Army soldiers on the Korean front, who are fighting the American invaders every day, is arduous. Houses within ten to twenty li of the front lines have all been destroyed by the American bandits' bombs and incendiary bombs. The soldiers live in trenches day and night, and the fighting is so fierce and continuous. For example, the Third Platoon of the Eighth Company of a certain regiment entered the Shangxiapu defensive position on December 9th of last year. By the 14th, the enemy had attacked them three times in six days. The enemy's strength increased from a platoon to a battalion, but under the heroic attacks of the Third Platoon comrades, the enemy suffered more than 170 casualties, and all three attacks were repelled. The regiment wanted to relieve the Third Platoon for rest. They said, "The New Year is coming soon. Let us fight an even bigger victory and send a New Year's gift to Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland before we go down." This resolute and enthusiastic heroic statement was made by the soldiers guarding the front line, living in the most arduous and tense days. They feel that doing so is the most pleasant and glorious thing. It is by no means accidental that the soldiers can generate this strong and brave spirit. Countless forces are inspiring and supporting them, and the greatest force is the support of the people of the motherland and the flesh-and-blood-like friendship and unity among comrades.
    The enthusiastic support of the people of the motherland for the Volunteer Army has become a huge force for overcoming the enemy and overcoming difficulties. When the motherland's letters of慰问, 慰问 bags, and supplies are sent to the trenches on the front lines, the soldiers hold them, look at them again and again, and everyone enthusiastically and proudly talks about the strength of the motherland, and everyone is a hundred times more energetic because of it. The Ninth Company of a certain unit received a letter from a worker at the Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 7. The letter said that there was a 52-year-old female worker in their factory named Li Shunbin, who insisted on working despite being sick. She fainted on the way to the factory but still went to work. After the two patients in the Ninth Squad heard the "little teacher" (because the front-line positions are scattered, classes cannot be concentrated, so a "little teacher" is selected in each squad to assist the instructor in giving classes and reading newspapers) read the letter, their eyes filled with tears. They sat up from the straw mat and said, "The old lady in her fifties is still going to work despite being sick in order to increase production and support the front lines. We are lying here with a slight headache and fever. Are we worthy of the people of the motherland?" After saying that, they picked up a pickaxe and went to the mountains to participate in digging fortifications.
    When the Volunteer Army soldiers heard the news that the young students of the motherland were enthusiastically participating in the military cadre schools, they were very moved, and thus more actively guarded their posts. After the soldiers of a certain anti-aircraft machine gun company heard the report of Comrade Ji Bingqian, a representative returning from Korea, about the story of an overseas Chinese student who clung to the stern of a ship and floated across the ocean in order to join the Volunteer Army, the soldiers took pride in being able to participate in the struggle to defend world peace in Korea. They felt that this was a kind of happiness, so everyone tried their best to do their job well, and any difficulties were overcome in front of them. The soldier Fan Yihua was not very familiar with weapons in the past. After listening to the report, he immediately found Comrade Cheng Li and signed a contract for guaranteed teaching and learning, guaranteeing: "Intensify the study of disassembly and shooting techniques, shoot down a few more enemy planes, and make contributions for the motherland and Chairman Mao."
    The letters of慰问 from the people of the motherland gave the soldiers great encouragement. In a battle on a certain highland, Tao Fu, a soldier in the Fifth Squad of the Third Company, was wounded. The squad leader persuaded him to go down, but he did not move. Later, the Party's small group leader went to persuade him again. Comrade Tao Fu took out a letter of慰问 from his shirt pocket and said excitedly, "Look, how can I go down?" Tears dripped down. A soldier of a certain unit was seriously injured and tightly grasped his shirt pocket in a coma. His comrades opened his hand and found a letter of慰问 from the motherland in his pocket, which was already soaked in blood. The comrades took it out for him, dried it, and saved it. After the soldier's injury improved a little, he took the letter back and put it in his new shirt pocket. Many wounded soldiers, before killing or wounding more enemies, and before repelling the enemy, were unwilling to leave the front line no matter what, for the sake of the motherland and to respond to the warm expectations of the people of the motherland, they must fight to the end.
    In the Volunteer Army troops, they also warm each other's hearts with 慰问 gifts from the motherland. The Second Squad of the Eighth Company of a certain unit went out to ambush the enemy and killed or wounded more than 20 American devils. In order to reward them for their heroic and resourceful victory, the regiment leader sent a bag of beef jerky produced by a certain ranch in Sichuan to the squad. When the comrades of the Second Squad received this bag of beef jerky, they felt as if they had seen the hearts of the people of the motherland. At the same time, because they were directly rewarded by the regiment leader, they were all extremely excited. However, they felt that their contributions and hardships were not as great as those of the Third Squad of the Ninth Company, who fought day and night on the front lines, so they wrote a letter and sent the beef jerky to the Third Squad of the Ninth Company. When the comrades of the Third Squad received it, their hearts seemed to jump out of their mouths. One soldier said, "How great this bag of beef jerky is! It's simply priceless." He continued to explain, "First, it carries the hopes of countless people in the motherland. Second, it carries the heart of the regiment leader. Third, it contains the friendship of the brother troops." After a discussion, for the sake of the three great hearts and hopes, they decided to hang the beef jerky at the entrance of the trench. At the same time, the squad took out two packs of Navy brand cigarettes 慰问 by the people of the motherland and sent them back to the brother squad of the Eighth Company. This kind of mutual 慰问 and encouragement is the source of the soldiers' strength to move forward bravely and fight the enemy tenaciously.

    祖国的一切鼓舞着我们
    中国人民志愿军归国代表　夏光
    在朝鲜前线日日打击着美国侵略者的志愿军战士们，生活是艰苦的。离战线一二十里地内的房子，统统被美国强盗的炸弹和燃烧弹摧毁了，战士们整日整夜住在战壕里，战斗是那么激烈地连续地进行着。比如某团八连三班在去年十二月九日进入上下浦防阵地，到十四日为止，六天中敌人向他们进攻三次，敌人的兵力由一个排增加到一个营，但在三班同志英勇打击下，敌人伤亡了一百七十余人，三次进攻都被打退了。团里要换三班下来休息。他们说：“快过年了，让我们再打一个更大的胜仗，给毛主席和祖国人民送一份年礼以后再下去吧。”这一句刚毅、热情的豪语，是守卫在最前线，生活在最艰苦、最紧张的日子里的战士们所说的。他们认为这样做最愉快、最光荣。战士们能够产生这种刚强、勇敢的精神，决不是偶然的，是无数的力量在鼓舞着、在支持着他们，最巨大的力量就是祖国人民的支援和同志间骨肉般的友爱和团结。
    祖国人民对志愿军热烈的支援，已经成为战胜敌人、战胜困难的巨大力量。当祖国的慰问信、慰问袋和物资送到前线的战壕时，战士们拿着看了又看，大家热烈地骄傲地谈论着祖国力量的雄厚，每个人都为之精神百倍。某部九连接到沈阳橡胶七厂一位工人寄来的信，信里说：他们厂里有一位五十二岁的女工李顺宾，有病仍坚持做工，在去工厂的路上昏倒过仍去上班。九班两个病号听“小教员”（前线阵地分散，不能集中上课，便在每班选一个“小教员”协助指导员上课、读报）读完这封信，眼泪盈框，他们从草铺里坐起来说：“五十多岁的老太太为了增加生产，支援前线，有病仍然去上工，我们患了一点头痛、发热的病就睡在这里，对得起祖国人民吗？”说完，就提着一把铁镐上山参加挖工事去了。
    志愿军战士们听到祖国青年学生热烈参加军事干部学校的消息时，都很感动，因而更积极地守住自己的岗位。某高射机枪连战士听了归国代表嵇炳前同志报告，有一个华侨学生为了参加志愿军，攀住轮船尾巴附在船上飘浮过海洋的故事以后，战士们纷纷以自己能够参加朝鲜保卫世界和平的斗争行列而骄傲，觉得这是一种幸福，因此每个人都想尽一切方法做好自己的工作，任何艰难困苦，在他们面前都被克服了。战士范一华过去对武器不大熟悉，听了报告后他立刻找程礼同志订了包教保学合同，保证：“加紧学习拆卸和射击技术，多打落几架敌机，为祖国为毛主席立功。”
    祖国人民的慰问信，给战士们极大的鼓舞。在某高地战斗中，三连五班战士陶福负伤了，班长劝他下去，他一动也不动，后来党的小组长又去劝他，陶福同志从衬衣口袋里掏出一封慰问信，激昂地说：“你们看我怎么能下去。”泪花丝丝地滴下来。某部一个战士受了重伤，在神志昏迷中用手紧抓着自己的衬衣口袋。同志们把他的手拉开，发现他的口袋里有一封从祖国来的慰问信，已经浸满了血渍。同志们给他拿出来烤干保存了。这位战士伤势好了一点之后，又把这封信要回去装到自己的新衬衣口袋里。许多负了伤的战士，在还没有杀伤更多的敌人，在没有将敌人打退以前，为了祖国和回答祖国人民的热望，他们无论如何也不愿下火线，一定要战斗到底。
    志愿军部队里，还互相以祖国的慰问品而温暖着彼此的心。某部八连二班出去伏击敌人，杀伤了二十多个美国鬼子，团首长为了奖励他们英勇机智所获得的胜利，将一袋四川某牧场出品的牛肉干送给该班。二班同志得到这袋牛肉干，好像见到了祖国人民的心，同时也因为直接受到团首长的奖励，都万分兴奋。但是他们认为自己的功劳和艰苦都比不上整日整夜抗击在最前沿的九连三班，于是写了一封信，把牛肉干转送给九连三班。三班同志收到了，心都像要从嘴里跳出来一样，有个战士说：“这包牛肉干多么伟大啊，它简直是无价之宝。”他继续解释说：“第一，它带着祖国无数人民的希望。第二，它带着团首长的心意。第三，它装着兄弟部队的友爱。”大家讨论了一番，为了三个伟大的心意和希望，决定将牛肉干挂在战壕门口。同时该班又掏出祖国人民慰问的两包海军牌香烟，回送给八连的兄弟班。这一种互相慰问和鼓励的行动，就是战士们勇往直前，顽强杀敌的力量源泉。
