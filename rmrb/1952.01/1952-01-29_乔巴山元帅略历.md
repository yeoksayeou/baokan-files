    Brief Biography of Marshal Choibalsan
    Marshal Choibalsan, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic:
    Choibalsan was born into a poor family on February 8, 1895. At the age of thirteen, he was sent to a Lama temple. At the age of seventeen, longing for light and freedom, Choibalsan finally escaped from the Lama temple and arrived in what was then Kulun (now Ulaanbaatar). He endured many hardships in Kulun, and finally got the opportunity to study at a school run by the Imperial Russian Consulate. In 1914, due to his excellent grades, he was sent to study at a middle school in Irkutsk, Russia. During his time at the school, he witnessed the great revolution carried out by the Russian people under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, which had a profound impact on him.
    In 1918, Choibalsan returned to Kulun and devoted himself to the struggle for national liberation. In 1920, he and Sukhe-Bator, a leader of the Mongolian People's Revolution, began to organize the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and organize guerrillas. On March 1, 1921, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party held its first congress, and the party decided to organize a revolutionary army, appointing Choibalsan as deputy commander-in-chief and political commissar. With the help of the Soviet Union, Sukhe-Bator and the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army led by him defeated the army commanded by the Chinese Northern Warlords, eliminated the White bandit army, and established a People's Government with a constitutional monarchy suitable for the political situation in Mongolia at that time.
    The great victory of the People's Revolution caused panic and unease among the Mongolian feudal ruling class. They assassinated the revolutionary leader Sukhe-Bator. Choibalsan shouldered the heavy responsibility of leading the revolution. In 1924, he succeeded as Commander-in-Chief of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army. Under Choibalsan's leadership, the Mongolian people crushed the conspiracies and riots of the feudal rulers and, in 1924, declared the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic. At the first Great Hural meeting of the Mongolian People's Republic, Choibalsan was elected as a member of the Small Hural. In 1928, at the Fifth Great Hural meeting he was elected Chairman of the Presidium of the Small Hural. In 1935, he served as First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. In 1936, he was awarded the title of Marshal. In 1939, he served as Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs. In 1940, the Great Hural of the Mongolian People's Republic adopted the constitution drafted with Choibalsan's participation, which summarized the victories achieved by the Mongolian people under Choibalsan's leadership. In 1945, he led the Mongolian people and the Soviet army in fighting side by side against Japanese fascism. Due to his meritorious service in defeating the Japanese fascists, he was awarded the glorious title of Marshal of the Soviet Union. In 1949, he was re-elected as Chairman of the Council of Ministers until his death.

    乔巴山元帅略历
    【新华社二十八日讯】蒙古人民共和国部长会议主席乔巴山元帅略历：
    乔巴山在一八九五年二月八日生于一个贫苦人民的家庭。十三岁，被送进喇嘛庙。十七岁那年，渴望光明自由的乔巴山终于逃出了喇嘛庙，到达当时的库伦（即乌兰巴托）。他在库伦饱经困苦，最后得到机会进入帝俄领事馆所办的一个学校学习。一九一四年，因为成绩优良，被派到俄国伊尔库次克的中学去学习。在学校期间，他亲眼看到俄国人民在布尔什维克党领导下所进行的伟大革命，这给了他以深刻的影响。
    一九一八年，乔巴山回到库伦，投身于争取民族解放的斗争。一九二零年，他和蒙古人民革命领袖苏赫—巴托尔着手组织蒙古人民革命党，并组织游击队。一九二一年三月一日，蒙古人民革命党召开第一次代表大会，党决定组织革命军队，派乔巴山为副总司令兼政治委员，在苏联的帮助下，苏赫—巴托尔和他率领的蒙古人民革命军队击败了中国北洋军阀所指挥的军队，肃清了白党匪军，建立了适合于当时蒙古政治情况的君主立宪制的人民政府。
    人民革命的伟大胜利，引起了蒙古封建上层统治者的惊慌和不安。他们暗杀了革命领袖苏赫—巴托尔。乔巴山肩负起领导革命的重任。一九二四年，他继任蒙古人民革命军总司令。在乔巴山的领导下，蒙古人民粉碎了封建统治者的阴谋暴乱，在一九二四年，宣布成立蒙古人民共和国。在蒙古人民共和国第一次大呼拉尔会议上，乔巴山当选为小呼拉尔委员。一九二八年，在第五次大呼拉尔会议上，他当选为小呼拉尔主席团主席。一九三五年，任部长会议第一副主席。一九三六年，获得元帅的称号。一九三九年，任部长会议主席兼外交部长。一九四○年，蒙古人民共和国大呼拉尔会议通过了乔巴山参加起草的宪法，这个宪法总结了蒙古人民在乔巴山领导下所取得的胜利。一九四五年，他领导蒙古人民和苏联军队并肩对日本法西斯作战，由于他在击溃日本法西斯战争中的功勋，他荣获苏联元帅的光荣称号。一九四九年，他再被推任部长会议主席，直到逝世为止。
