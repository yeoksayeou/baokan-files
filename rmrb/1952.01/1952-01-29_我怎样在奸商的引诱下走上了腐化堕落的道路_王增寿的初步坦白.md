How I was Led Down the Path of Corruption and Degeneracy Under the Enticement of Unscrupulous Merchants
—Wang Zengshou’s Preliminary Confession
	In March 1950, I was transferred from the Northwest Iron and Steel Company to the Tianjin Office of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Heavy Industry Department to work in procurement. After that, I frequently came into contact with merchants and greatly envied their material life. In August, I went to Taiyuan with several merchants. As soon as we boarded the train, the merchants courteously offered me cigarettes and meals. When changing trains in Fengtai, the merchants said to me, "We are upgrading to soft seats; it wouldn't look right for you to sit in a hard seat. Let's get you a soft seat. Since it can't be reimbursed, we'll pay for it." At the time, for the sake of face and comfort, I listened to them and switched to a soft seat. Later, when we went to the dining car for meals, they paid for everything. After arriving in Taiyuan, the merchants took me to a large hotel, asked waitresses to accompany me in drinking, and treated me to baths and cold dishes. They also flattered me, praising me and saying, "Comrade Wang, someone like you should find a wife." The merchant Liu Shirui even said, "When you're on business trips, you can make some money on the side. It's very common. What's it matter if you spend a little of our money? We won't tell anyone else." From then on, I got used to hanging out with them and spoke without any reservations.
	After returning to Tianjin, the unscrupulous merchants had already seized upon my weaknesses and surrounded me from all sides. The middleman Xing Fuwang took me to eat cold dishes and meals, paying for everything silently, and even wanted to give me 500,000 yuan, which I didn't accept at the time. He then invited me to see a vaudeville show, but I refused. He said, "We're friends; it doesn't matter, there's nothing wrong with seeing a show." Eventually, I went with him. On another occasion, I went to Linji Lumber to inspect goods, and Xing Fuwang also went. After the inspection, Xing Fuwang and Shi Xiuwen of Linji Lumber invited me to eat at Taihua Restaurant. Shi Xiuwen pushed my bicycle for me and hired a pedicab, insisting that I go. I thought it would be impolite to refuse, so I went. After the meal, Shi Xiuwen said, "Let me introduce you to a potential partner." Xing Fuwang said, "If you need anything for the wedding, I'll give it to you; we're friends." In September 1950, I went to Linji Lumber again to inspect goods. Shi Xiuwen called me to the back room and wanted to give me a 5 million yuan check, but I didn't dare to take it. He then invited me to a restaurant. I got drunk, and he put the check in my pocket. I didn't discover it until two or three days later. Later, I gave the check to Xing Fuwang to cash and kept the money with him for small expenses.
	In October 1950, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant wanted to buy a batch of Pinus Koraensis wood. After the quotation, Shi Xiuwen of Linji Lumber and the middleman Xing Fuwang wanted to do this business. One evening, they invited me to a small restaurant. During the meal, they asked me, "Are you going to buy the batch of Pinus Koraensis wood that has already been quoted?" I said, "We will buy, but it still needs consideration." They then asked me to help them. After the meal, they took me to the South Market to visit prostitutes. At the time, I was a little scared and didn't dare to go. They said, "If someone investigates, we'll say you're a guest of our shop." The next day, I needed money and took 500,000 yuan from them again. They wanted to "be friends" with me and asked me to bring my old mother to Tianjin, saying they would find a house for her. Later, Shi Xiuwen asked me again if the contract for the Pinus Koraensis wood had been signed. I said it had to be studied with the higher-ups. He said, "Why study it if the price doesn't exceed the market price!" He also said, "If this contract is signed, the profits will be divided equally among the three of us." At the time, I was scared and felt conflicted: if I didn't sign, I had already used his money; if I signed, it would be serious if I made a mistake later. Two or three days later, Xing Fuwang and Shi Xiuwen invited me to Taihua Restaurant again. During the meal, Shi Xiuwen wanted to give me a check. I knew their intentions, so I didn't accept it at the time. But they insisted on giving it, so Xing Fuwang took it for me. After the contract was signed, I was very worried, fearing that they would not deliver the goods on time. Later, although the goods were delivered, many were unqualified after they arrived in Taiyuan. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant requested a replacement. Linji Lumber repeatedly asked me to write a letter to Taiyuan, urging the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant to accept the goods. Finally, I wrote a letter to the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, asking them to re-select the goods, offer a discount based on the actual situation, and perfunctorily ended the matter.
	In October 1950, because of frequent business contacts, I met Huang Ziwang, a merchant from Donglai Lumber, and we often interacted. Huang Ziwang treated me very well, taking me to see plays, eating meals, and introducing me to potential wives. I also regarded him as a confidant, discussing matters with him, and I was somewhat accommodating to him in business. Later, I also frequently interacted with merchants such as Liu Shirui of Yuanxing Lumber and Du Zhenhua of Xinhua Lumber, taking things from them and taking advantage of them.
	Since I was tempted by unscrupulous merchants and engaged in bribery, the burden in my heart has been very heavy. With a guilty conscience, I was always afraid of comrades and superiors, and I couldn't sleep or eat well. During the rectification campaign, the internal struggle was even more intense, but I was afraid of losing face and being punished, so I didn't reveal anything. Later, the leadership sent me to study at the Party School, where I also muddled through without confessing my problems.
	Since the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, I initially remained stubbornly unenlightened and didn't want to talk. When the leadership asked me, I would talk about some unimportant things. After listening to Mayor Huang Jing's report, I began to feel sad in my heart, and I initially realized that the mistakes I had made were very serious, and I was also very scared. I considered: this campaign is so widespread that my bad deeds would be exposed one day. Later, the atmosphere of anti-corruption and anti-waste in the organization became more and more serious, and the leadership talked to me again, and my ideological struggle was very intense at that time. After work, I dared not go out, fearing that others would suspect that I was looking for merchants to plot bad ideas; if I didn't go out, I was afraid that others would say, "Look, he doesn't go out as soon as the anti-corruption campaign starts; he used to wander outside every day." At night, I couldn't sleep all night, and I didn't even dare to turn over, fearing that others would know that I had something on my mind. I always wanted to find a newspaper to read, to find out how big a crime would result in being sent to court, but I could only secretly read the newspaper behind people's backs. These days, although the government has not declared me a criminal, I have been completely living the life of a criminal. My nerves were so tense that I was almost going crazy. At the cadre meeting of the Tianjin Office of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau, I listened to the mobilization report of the leading comrades, and then I decided to confess my problems. Before the meeting adjourned, I confessed to the leading comrades, and in one breath, I got rid of the dirty burden I had been carrying for a long time.
	I am a Communist Party member who has participated in the revolution since the age of sixteen. The Party loves me and cultivates me, but because I coveted personal shameful enjoyment, I fell for the tricks of unscrupulous merchants, became corrupted and degenerate, and did things that were unworthy of the Party and the people. In addition to asking the superiors to give me the punishment I deserve, I am determined to correct my mistakes, make amends for my crimes, and start anew. (Originally published in Tianjin Daily)

    我怎样在奸商的引诱下走上了腐化堕落的道路
    ——王增寿的初步坦白
    一九五○年三月，我从西北钢铁公司调到中央重工业部钢铁工业局天津事务所担任采购工作。这以后，就经常和商人接触，对他们的物质生活非常羡慕。八月，我同几个商人一块去太原。一上火车，商人们就殷勤地招待我吸烟、吃饭。在丰台换车时，商人向我说：“我们要换软席了，你自己坐硬席多不像话，给你换个软席吧，报不了账，我们替你出钱。”我当时为了面子和舒服，就听了他们的话，换了软席。以后同他们去餐车上吃饭，也都由他们付了钱。到了太原以后，商人们又拉着我去住大饭店，叫女招待陪我喝酒，请我洗澡、吃冷食。他们并恭维我，为我捧场说：“王同志，像你这样的人，应当找个太太。”商人刘士瑞还说：“你们出差，可以从中弄些钱，这样的事多得很。你和我们在一起，花我们几个钱算什么？我们也不会告诉别人。”从此以后，我就和他们混惯了，说话也没有一点顾虑了。
    回到天津以后，奸商们已经抓住了我的缺点，从四面包围上来。跑合人邢复旺拉我去吃冷食、吃饭，他都不言不语地付了钱，并且还要给我五十万元，我当时没有要。他又引我去看杂耍，我不去。他说：“咱们是朋友，没关系，看看戏没啥。”最后我就跟他去了。另一次，我到林记木行去看货，邢复旺也去了。看完后，邢复旺和林记木行的石秀文请我到泰华楼吃饭。石秀文给我推着自行车，又给我雇了三轮车，硬叫我去。我想不去不好意思，也就去了。吃饭以后，石秀文说：“我给你介绍个对象吧。”邢复旺说：“结婚时缺什么，我送给你，咱们是朋友。”一九五○年九月里，有一次，我又到林记木行去看货。石秀文把我叫到后屋，要给我五百万元的支票，我不敢要。他便邀我到饭馆去吃饭。我喝醉了酒，他便把支票装到我的口袋里。隔了二、三天我才发现。后来，我把支票交给邢复旺取出来，存在他那里零取零用。
    一九五○年十月份，太原钢铁厂要买松元木一批。在报价后，林记木行石秀文，跑合的邢复旺想要做这笔生意。一天晚上就邀我去小馆吃饭。在吃饭时，他们问我：“现已报了价的那批松元木是否买呢？”我说：“买是买，不过还需考虑。”他们就请我多帮忙。饭后，他们领我到南市嫖妓女。当时我有点害怕，不敢去。他们说：“如有人查，就说是我们柜上的客人。”第二天我需要用钱，又从他们那里拿了五十万元。他们要和我“作朋友”，并且叫我把老母亲接来，他们给找房子。以后石秀文便又问我那批松元木合同是否订呢？我说要和上级研究。他说：“价格不超过市价，研究什么呀！”还说：“这合同如订了，所得的利润，我们三人共同分。”我当时害了怕，心里很矛盾：要是不订，已经用了他的钱；要是订了，以后犯了错误，那可就严重了。两三天后，邢复旺、石秀文又请我到泰华楼吃饭。在吃饭时，石秀文要送给我一张支票。我当时也知道他们的用意，所以当时没有收。但他们非给不可，最后便由邢复旺替我收下了。合同签订后，我非常担心，怕他们不能如期交货。后来虽然交了货，但结果货运到太原后，很多不合格。太原钢铁厂提出更换。林记木行一再向我请求，要我向太原去信，劝太原钢铁厂收下这批货。最后，还是写了信给太原钢铁厂，请他们重新挑选，按实际情况酌情折扣，马虎地结束了这桩事。
    一九五○年十月份，因为经常接洽业务，我认识了东来木行的商人黄子旺，经常和他来往。黄子旺请我看戏、吃饭，并且给我介绍老婆，对我很好。我也把他当作知心朋友，有事和他商量，在业务上也就对他迁就一些。以后还和元兴木行刘士瑞、新华木行杜振华等商人经常来往，从他们那里拿点东西，占他们一些便宜。
    自从我受了奸商的诱惑，发生贪污受贿的行为后，自己内心的负担一直很重，做贼心虚，老是怕同志，怕上级，寝食不安。在整风的时候，内心的斗争更激烈，但怕丢面子，怕受处罚，一点都没有暴露。后来领导方面送我到党校学习，我在党校也同样地混过去了，没有交代自己的问题。
    自从反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开展以来，最初我仍然执迷不悟，不想谈。领导方面问我时，我就拉点不关紧要的说说。等到听了黄敬市长的报告以后，心里开始觉得难过，初步认识到自己所犯的错误很严重，同时心里也很害怕。我考虑到：这个运动开展的面这样广，自己的坏事总有一天要被揭发。后来机关里反贪污、反浪费的空气愈来愈严重，领导上又找我谈话，当时自己的思想斗争非常激烈。下了班，我不敢出门，怕别人怀疑我是找商人想鬼主意去了；不出门，又怕别人会说：“你看，一反贪污他就不出门了，平常天天在外面逛。”晚上，我通宵睡不着觉，睡不着觉连身都不敢翻，怕别人知道我有心事。我老想找报看，找一找犯多大罪的就要送法院去，但也只能背着人偷着看报。这些日子，政府虽然没有宣判我是犯罪的人，但我已经完全过的是犯人的日子。我的神经紧张得几乎要发疯。在钢铁工业局天津事务所干部大会上，我听了领导同志的动员报告，于是下决心交代问题。没有等到散会，我就向领导同志坦白了，一气说完，丢掉了身上背了许久的肮脏的包袱。
    我是一个共产党员，从十六岁起参加了革命。党爱护我，培养我，但是因为自己贪图个人可耻的享受，竟上了奸商的当，腐化堕落，做出了对不起党、对不起人民的事。除了请求上级给我应得的处分外，今后决心改正自己的错误，戴罪立功，重新作人。    （原载天津日报）
