Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Tokyo dispatch: The Yoshida government's violation of the will of the Japanese people by giving Dulles the shameful "guarantee" letter has been universally denounced and criticized in Japan. The Provisional Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 17th, denouncing Yoshida's illegal measures as an act of selling out Japan by abusing his power. The statement emphasized that there is no country called Taiwan in the world. The Kuomintang government in Taiwan is merely a handful of exiled politicians, and it is most foolish to conclude a treaty with this regime. This is an open challenge to the Chinese people.

Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party's left wing, also issued a statement on the matter. He was dissatisfied that Yoshida wrote the letter to Dulles "unilaterally." He said: "Japan and Britain cannot establish an independent economy without trading with China and the Soviet Union. This fact cannot be ignored." He pointed out that Japan's conclusion of peace with the Kuomintang remnants "is tantamount to abandoning Japan's independent economy and peace in Asia. This is a matter concerning the fate of Japan."

The Japanese economic community generally expressed disappointment with Yoshida's letter. Kyodo News Agency's Tokyo dispatch on the 16th revealed that the opinions of the Japanese "industrial and trading circles" on Yoshida's letter were: According to the "realistic" situation, if trade between Japan and People's China is completely cut off, "cheap raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal cannot be imported. Then, it will have the opposite effect to the necessary conditions for Japan's economic independence - reducing production costs and rationalizing industry. Furthermore, it may threaten the independence of (Japanese) trade." In addition, merchants in the Kansai region (the Kyoto-Osaka area), which has a historical relationship with China's trade, are "also very disappointed" with Yoshida's letter.

Some bourgeois newspapers in Japan also expressed similar dissatisfaction. "Asahi Shimbun" expressed "regret" that "Yoshida Shigeru did not consult with the Japanese people in advance on this major issue before sending the letter to Dulles." "Mainichi Shimbun" believes that "restoring normal relations between Taiwan and Japan does not mean that the China problem has been completely resolved." On the contrary, "in fact, this may make the problem worse."

Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: The British people have expressed indignation and opposition to the United States' order to the Japanese Yoshida government to guarantee peace with the Kuomintang remnants.

The London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 18th, commenting on Yoshida's letter to Dulles, saying: "This American-imposed decision is to build up the military strength of Japan and Chiang Kai-shek in preparation for launching a war against the People's Republic of China at an early date." The newspaper pointed out that "recognition of Chiang Kai-shek will have adverse effects, which means that Britain's already reduced trade with China will be greatly curtailed." "The United States is currently restricting trade between Japan and China, with the result that Japan is forced to find new outlets in British overseas markets and other European countries." The editorial concluded by pointing out the increasing threat of large-scale unemployment in Lancashire and called on the British people to defend themselves and fight against the Conservative government.

Before Yoshida's letter was published, the "Peace News," the organ of the British Non-Violence Association, had published an editorial condemning Dulles for coercing the Yoshida government to recognize the Chiang Kai-shek gang during his "visit" to Japan last December. The editorial said: "The Japanese are clearly being used as captive nationals and as a tool to promote America's concept of world order." The editorial argued: "The Americans should be made aware of Britain's extreme dissatisfaction with American actions as soon as possible," and that "to force the Japanese to stand behind Chiang Kai-shek would clearly create a political crime."

The U.S. government's arrogant pressure on the Yoshida government has even forced British government officials, under the pressure of the British people's anger and for the selfish purposes of imperialism, to deliberately express "annoyance." According to a United Press dispatch from London, "British officials on the 17th accused the United States of influencing Japan's decision to recognize Nationalist China, and the British government formally expressed regret over the United States' use of pressure on Japan." Although British Foreign Office officials "carefully avoided mentioning the United States" in publicly released statements, they "privately made it clear that they believed Japan was acting under American pressure"; they also "privately expressed considerable annoyance." What these British officials were annoyed about was that the United States, disregarding Britain's interests, had reneged on the shameful agreement reached between Dulles and then-British Foreign Secretary Morrison last June. According to that agreement, the British government complied with the U.S. government's opinion on excluding the People's Republic of China from the peace treaty with Japan, while the United States recognized that after the separate peace treaty with Japan came into effect, "Japan has the right to decide its relationship with China on its own." The "Daily Mirror" published an editorial on the 18th, criticizing the United States, saying: "British diplomacy and European interests have suffered an embarrassing blow from the United States." The editorial condemned the United States' breach of contract, saying: "Unfortunately, Britain has approved the (American-made) peace treaty with Japan, but we did so believing that the United States would abide by its promises not only in the letter but also in the spirit. According to this treaty, Japan itself is free to decide its relations with China, and Britain believes that the United States' use of pressure - which is undeniable - is an act of bad faith." According to United Press, the "general opinion" in London now is that "Britain has been fooled" by "American tricks." Because, as the Associated Press revealed, "Britain has taken a different attitude from the United States in this regard" because of "the hope that Japan, as an industrial nation, will restore its traditional trade relations with mainland China" in order to avoid the "losses" suffered by Britain in recent years due to Japanese exports to Southeast Asia and other regions.

### 日本人民普遍斥责吉田非法措施  英国人民反对美国强制日本与蒋匪媾和

    日本人民普遍斥责吉田非法措施
    英国人民反对美国强制日本与蒋匪媾和
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：吉田政府违反日本人民意志而给杜勒斯的可耻的“保证”书，在日本遭到了普遍的斥责和抨击。日本共产党临时中央指导部在十七日发表声明，斥责吉田这一非法措施是他利用职权，出卖了日本。声明强调说：世界上没有一个名叫台湾的国家。台湾的国民党政府仅仅是一撮流亡的政客，和这个政权缔结条约是最愚笨的事。这是对中国人民的公开挑战。
    社会党左派中央执行委员会主席铃木茂三郎也为此事发表谈话。他不满吉田“独断地”写信给杜勒斯。他说：“日本和英国都是不和中国与苏联进行贸易就不可能建立自主的经济的。这个事实是不容忽视的。”他指出：日本和国民党残匪媾和，“无异放弃日本的自主经济和亚洲的和平。这是有关日本命运的事。”
    日本经济界对吉田的信普遍地感到失望。共同社东京十六日电透露，日本“产业界和贸易界”对吉田的信的意见是：根据“现实”的情况，如果日本和人民中国的贸易完全断绝了，“铁矿、粘结性煤等廉价原料就不能进口。那么，就会造成和日本经济自立的必要条件——减低生产成本、产业合理化——相反的后果。更进一步，有可能威胁（日本）贸易的自立。”此外，对中国贸易有历史关系的关西地方（京都—大阪一带）的商人，对于吉田的信，“失望也很大”。
    日本一部分资产阶级报纸也表现出同样的不满情绪。“朝日新闻”对“吉田茂没有预先和日本人民商量这个重大的问题就把信发给杜勒斯”，表示“很遗憾”。“每日新闻”认为：“恢复台湾和日本之间的正常关系并不意味着彻底地解决了中国问题。”相反地，“事实上这可能使这个问题更糟。”
    【新华社二十二日讯】英国人民对于美国命令日本吉田政府保证与国民党残匪媾和一事，纷纷表示愤慨和反对。
    伦敦“工人日报”十八日发表社论，评论吉田给杜勒斯的信说：“采取这个美国强迫的决定，是为了建立日本和蒋介石的军事力量，准备早日向中华人民共和国发动战争。”该报指出：“承认蒋介石将有不良影响，这意味着英国和中国已经减少了的贸易将大大削减。”“美国目前已在限制日本和中国的贸易，其结果是日本被迫在英国的海外市场和其他的欧洲国家寻找新的出路。”社论结束时指出兰开夏大批失业的威胁日增，并要求英国人民保卫他们自己并与保守党政府作斗争。
    在吉田的信发表以前，英国非战团体的机关报“和平新闻”就曾发表社论，谴责杜勒斯在去年十二月“访问”日本时要挟吉田政府承认蒋介石匪帮。社论说：“日本人分明被当作被俘掳的国民使用着，并被当作助长美国的世界秩序的概念的一个工具。”社论主张：“应该及早使美国人明白英国对美国的行动是极表不满的”，“倘若强迫日本人站在蒋介石的背后，分明就会制造出一种政治罪恶来。”
    美国政府对于吉田政府所施用的蛮横压力，甚至使英国政府人士在英国人民愤怒的压力之下，并为了帝国主义的自私目的，也不得不故意表示“恼怒”。据合众社伦敦讯，“英国人士十七日指责美国影响日本决定承认国民党中国，英国政府对于美国对日本使用压力一事，正式表示遗憾。”英国外交部官员在公开发表的声明中虽然“小心地避免提到美国”，但“私下明白地表示，他们相信日本是在美国压力下行动的”；他们并且“私下表示甚为恼怒”。这些英国官员所恼怒的是美国不顾英国的利益，毁弃了去年六月间杜勒斯和当时英国外交大臣莫里逊所达到的可耻协议。根据那个协议，英国政府顺从了美国政府关于排斥中华人民共和国于对日和约之外的意见，而美国则承认在单独对日和约生效以后，“日本有权自行决定它与中国的关系”。“每日镜报”在十八日发表社论，抨击美国说：“英国的外交和欧洲的利益已遭到美国的令人难堪的打击。”社论谴责美国的违约行为说：“不幸英国已经批准（美制）对日和约，但是我们这样做，是相信美国会不仅在条文上而且在精神上遵守他们的诺言。根据这个和约，日本自己可以自由决定对中国的关系，英国认为美国施用压力——这是不容否认的——是背信弃义的行为。”据合众社说，现在伦敦“一般的意见”认为：由于“美国的把戏”，“英国已上了当”。因为，如美联社所透露的，“英国在这方面采取与美国不同的态度”，是“由于希望日本这个工业国家恢复其与中国大陆的传统的贸易关系”，以避免最近几年来日本对东南亚等地的输出使英国遭受的“损失”。
