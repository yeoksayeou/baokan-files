    Leading Cadres of Miyun County Trading Company in Hebei Should Examine Embezzlement and Waste

    Editor: The leading cadres of the Miyun County Trading Company in Hebei Province do not earnestly implement policies and fail to supervise the embezzlement and waste of lower-level cadres, causing losses to state property. Zhang Zhongyuan, the business section chief of the company, often consorted with private merchants. He once borrowed 400,000 yuan from a merchant in Beijing and then gave 144 sacks belonging to the company as a "favor" to the merchant for a month's use. The payment for goods sold to this merchant was collected more than a month overdue. The company's leading cadres never inquired about these matters. Some cadres, when going to Beijing on business, often accepted invitations from private merchants for meals and shows. The leading cadres not only did not inspect or criticize this, but also approved a "subsidy" of 100,000 yuan for them. More seriously, this company neglected policies and, finding it troublesome to withdraw money from the bank, deposited 40 million yuan of purchasing funds in the privately-owned Yongtaihe Paper Store in Beijing, which took half a month to clear. They also used 40 million yuan of purchasing funds meant for buying peanuts for the Beijing Native Produce Warehouse to purchase daily necessities for profit. In order to make money, they sold 400 catties of copper they had acquired to private merchants without government approval. In addition, the company's accounting system is also unsound, creating opportunities for embezzlers. For example, 200 packs of matches and 80 boxes of cigarettes went missing within a month; the accounts also had a deficit of 300,000 yuan. The leading cadres have never inquired about or corrected any of the above situations. I believe that the bureaucratic work style of the company's leading cadres is serious, and they should make a profound self-criticism.

    河北密云县贸易公司领导干部应检查贪污浪费
    编辑同志：河北省密云县贸易公司领导干部不认真执行政策，对下级干部的贪污浪费行为不加过问，使国家资财遭受损失。公司的业务股长张中元，常和私商鬼混，曾借用过北京某商人四十万元，后来竟把公司的一百四十四条麻袋作“人情”借给这个商人使用了一个月；卖给这个商人的货物款，过期一个多月才取回。公司的领导干部对这些事从不查问。有的干部因事到北京，也常接受私商的邀请，吃饭、看戏，领导干部不但不加检查、批评，还批准给他们十万元的“补助费”。更严重的是这个公司忽视政策，嫌在银行提款麻烦，竟把四千万元买货款存在北京私营永太和纸店内，半个月才支清。他们还把给北京土产货栈买花生的四千万元货款，用来购买日用品牟利；他们为了赚钱，不经政府同意，竟擅自把收购的四百斤铜卖给私商。此外，公司的会计制度也很不健全，给贪污分子造成钻空子的机会。如在一个月内就少了二百包火柴、八十盒纸烟；账上也差三十万元。像上面这些情况，领导干部从没有过问和纠正过。我认为这个公司领导干部的官僚主义作风是严重的，他们应作深刻的检讨。　刘音
