    Heroic Korean Worker Brothers
    The Korean working class, who have been heroically struggling against the mad destruction of American imperialism and ensuring the production and supply of military supplies, sent three representatives—Kim Myung-hyun, Kang Jung-seok, and Han Sang-ik—to China to participate in the Korean People's Delegation to China. Their heroic deeds demonstrate the excellent qualities of the Korean working class.
    Kim Myung-hyun is a young mechanical worker in a factory in Korea. In July 1950, their factory was bombed by American air bandits, so they evacuated the machines to mountain caves and continued production. When the People's Army actively retreated, they buried the machines. Kim Myung-hyun did not retreat at that time, but went to the mountains to fight guerrillas. When the Chinese and Korean People's Armies fought back, Kim Myung-hyun immediately returned to the factory. They dug out the buried machines and collected the scattered machine parts. In just two months, they resumed production.
    During the war, there was a shortage of labor, especially skilled workers. Kim Myung-hyun demonstrated a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm. In the ten months from March to December 1951, he trained 63 skilled workers for the country. When some of the machines in the factory had problems, affecting the production of the entire factory, Kim Myung-hyun tried everything possible to repair them, increasing the overall production of the factory to 200% to 300%. Due to his outstanding contribution to production, Kim Myung-hyun was awarded the Third-Class National Flag Medal.
    Kang Jung-seok is a miner in a mine in Korea. When he restored the mine, which had been severely damaged by the enemy, last spring, he displayed amazing wisdom. In the case of wartime material difficulties, he manufactured his own machine parts, enabling the mine to quickly resume production and increase work efficiency. For example, originally 300 cm of explosives could only blast one meter deep of ore, but he adopted a new working method to increase the depth of the explosion to one and a half meters. Kang Jung-seok has not been absent from work for a single day since the beginning of the war. He works in the mine for 26 days a month, and even eats in the mine. He improved his operating methods so that his output consistently maintained a level of 230% to 350%. By the end of 1951, Kang Jung-seok had increased his output to 700%. Kang Jung-seok was awarded the Medal of Honor and the Medal of Merit for his selfless work spirit.
    During the war, ensuring the smooth flow of transportation between the front and the rear was an important task for Korean railway workers. Han Sang-ik, a train driver from the Pyongyang Railway Administration, ensured the completion of transportation tasks under any difficult and dangerous circumstances. Therefore, he was awarded the Military Service Medal.
    One night during the rainy season last year, Han Sang-ik was driving a train carrying supplies to the front. On the way, he encountered enemy planes. Han Sang-ik wanted to drive the train into the tunnel ahead, but both tunnels (Korean railways are double-tracked) were impassable: one was flooded by rain; the other was blocked by a broken locomotive. Regardless of the enemy planes' strafing and bombing, he quickly used his own locomotive to pull the broken locomotive stuck in a cave to the side, and then drove his own train into the tunnel to hide, so that the supplies on the train were not damaged at all.
    Korean train drivers drive at night and lead road workers to repair roads during the day. Last winter, Han Sang-ik led 30 road workers to repair a 230-meter-long bridge in ten days. When enemy planes came to bomb and strafe, they hid in the cold river water. The 160-li-long railway line from Pyongyang to Sariwon was damaged in 102 places by enemy planes. If it were to be repaired, it would require more than 43,000 people's labor. Han Sang-ik led his road construction team and mobilized only 1,500 people to complete the road repair project.

    英雄的朝鲜工人兄弟们
    和美帝国主义的疯狂破坏作英勇的斗争，保证了军需物资的生产和供应的朝鲜工人阶级，派了三位代表——金明炫、康仲锡、韩尚益参加朝鲜人民访华代表团到我国来了。他们的英勇事迹，表现了朝鲜工人阶级的优秀品质。
    金明炫是朝鲜某工厂的青年机械工人。一九五○年七月，他们的工厂遭受美国空中强盗的轰炸，于是，他们就把机器疏散到山洞里，继续生产。人民军主动撤退时，他们就把机器埋起来。金明炫当时没有撤退，跑到山里打游击去了。等到中朝人民军队打回来时，金明炫马上回到工厂。他们把埋藏的机器挖出来，收集了散失的机器零件，只有两个月，又重新恢复生产。
    战时劳动力缺乏，技术工人尤其缺乏，金明炫发挥了高度的爱国热忱，在一九五一年三月到十二月的十个月中，他为国家培养了六十三名技术工人。当工厂中一部分机器发生了障碍，影响了全厂的生产时，金明炫就想尽一切办法把它修好，使全厂的生产普遍地提高到百分之二百到三百。由于在生产中的卓越贡献，金明炫荣获三级国旗勋章。
    康仲锡是朝鲜某矿山的矿工。在去年春天恢复曾遭受敌人严重破坏的矿山时，他发挥了惊人的智慧。在战时物资困难的情况下，他自己制造机器零件，使矿山迅速恢复生产，而且提高了工作效率。例如原来用三百公分炸药只能炸开一公尺深的矿石，他采取了新的工作方法，把爆炸的深度增加到一公尺半。康仲锡从战争开始直到现在，一天也没有缺过勤。他一个月在矿坑中工作二十六天，连吃饭也在矿坑里吃。他改进了操作方法，使他的产量经常保持百分之二百三十到百分之三百五十的水平。到一九五一年年底，康仲锡已把产量提高到百分之七百了。康仲锡以他的忘我的工作精神，荣获荣誉奖章和功劳章。
    在战争中，保证前后方运输的畅通，是朝鲜铁路工人的重要任务。平壤铁路管理局的火车司机韩尚益，在任何困难和危险的情况下，都保证完成运输的任务。因此，他荣获军功章。
    在去年雨季某天夜里，韩尚益开着火车运送物资到前方去。途中遇到敌机，韩尚益想把火车开到前面的隧道里去，可是两个隧道（朝鲜铁道是双轨的）都不通：一个被雨水淹没了；另一个被一辆坏了的车头塞住了。他不顾敌机的扫射、轰炸，很快地用自己的车头把塞在一个山洞里的坏了的车头拉到旁边去，再把自己的火车开到隧道里去隐蔽，使车上的物资没有受到一点损失。
    朝鲜的火车司机们，夜间开车，白天还带领修路工人修路。去年冬天，韩尚益曾带领三十名修路工人，在十天内修复了一座长二百三十公尺的桥梁。敌机来轰炸、扫射时，他们就躲到冰冷的河水里。从平壤到沙里院的一百六十里长的铁路线，被敌机破坏了一百零二处，如果把它修复起来，就需要四万三千多人的劳动力。韩尚益带领着他的修路工程队，只动员了一千五百人，就完成了修路的工程。
