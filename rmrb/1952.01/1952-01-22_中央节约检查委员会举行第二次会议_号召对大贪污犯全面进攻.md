Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: The Central People's Government Committee for Thrift Examination held its second meeting on the afternoon of January 21st. Those attending the meeting included: Bo Yibo, Director of the Committee for Thrift Examination; Shen Junru and Tan Pingshan, Deputy Directors; and Committee Members Wu Gaizhi, Lan Gongwu, Chen Shaoxian, Zhang Naiqi, Peng Zemin, Ma Xulun, Liu Jingfan, Liu Lantao, Luo Ruiqing, Shi Liang, Teng Daiyuan, Zhang Bojun, Fu Zuoyi, Li Dequan, Rong Zihe, Xu Deheng, Lai Ruoyu, Qi Yanming, Sun Qimeng, Tao Xijin, and Zhou Rongxin.

The meeting heard a report by Liu Jingfan, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government Committee for Thrift Examination, on the situation and further development plans and steps of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in central-level agencies. In his report, Liu Jingfan first stated that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in central-level agencies had achieved great success as of January 19th. These achievements are mainly reflected in the following three aspects: First, due to the implementation of Chairman Mao's guiding principle of "leaders taking the lead and conducting reviews at each level," leaders of various agencies have received profound education in the movement, the connection between leaders and the masses has become closer, and the prestige of the Communist Party and the People's Government has been further enhanced. Second, the masses within various agencies have been truly mobilized. The shortcomings in the internal life and work of various agencies, especially the shortcomings in leadership work, have been subjected to strict criticism by the masses. Therefore, this surging mass movement not only has the fundamental significance of opposing bourgeois erosion, but also has the significance of democratic reform within the agencies. Third, leading cadres and the masses in various agencies have gained preliminary experience and significant results in this struggle against bourgeois erosion. A large number of embezzlers have confessed or been exposed, embezzlement has been hated by the broad masses, the atmosphere of waste has been greatly changed, and comrades who are simple and hardworking have been respected by the broad masses.

Secretary-General Liu Jingfan then pointed out that although we have achieved great results in the past 19 days, many embezzlers, especially major embezzlers, have just begun to emerge in this movement and have not yet been completely broken through. The materials from confessions and reports within the agencies and confessions and reports from the business community have just begun to be combined. To this end, all agencies should lead the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement to a new climax. Leaders at all levels should immediately organize forces, seize the key points, fully mobilize the masses on the one hand, and conduct thorough investigation and research work on the other hand, to launch a full-scale offensive against major embezzlers.

The meeting approved Liu Jingfan's report and called on central-level agencies to not only continue to comprehensively investigate corruption and waste, but also immediately shift their main energy to the fight against major embezzlers. Director Bo Yibo finally announced that anyone who has committed embezzlement and can thoroughly explain their problem before January 26th will be treated as a voluntary confession. Except for those who have committed heinous crimes, they may be given lenient, reduced, or exempted punishment as appropriate. Otherwise, they will be severely punished according to law.

    中央节约检查委员会举行第二次会议
    号召对大贪污犯全面进攻
    薄一波主任宣布：凡犯有贪污行为者，能在一月二十六日前彻底交代清楚，均作为自动坦白论，除罪大恶极者外，均可从轻处刑。
    【新华社二十一日讯】中央人民政府节约检查委员会在二十一日下午举行第二次会议。出席会议的，有：节约检查委员会主任薄一波，副主任沈钧儒、谭平山，委员吴溉之、蓝公武、陈劭先、章乃器、彭泽民、马叙伦、刘景范、刘澜涛、罗瑞卿、史良、滕代远、章伯钧、傅作义、李德全、戎子和、许德珩、赖若愚、齐燕铭、孙起孟、陶希晋、周荣鑫。
    会议听取了中央人民政府节约检查委员会秘书长刘景范所作的关于中央一级机关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的情况和进一步开展的方针、步骤的报告。刘景范在报告中首先说到：中央一级各机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，迄一月十九日止，已取得了很大成绩。这些成绩，主要表现在下列三方面：第一、由于实行了毛主席所指示的“首长带头、层层检讨”的方针，各机关的领导人，在运动中已受到沉痛教育，领导和群众的联系密切了，共产党和人民政府的威信更加提高了。第二、各机关内部的群众已经真正发动起来。各机关内部生活和工作中的缺点，特别是领导工作中的缺点，已经受到群众的严格批评。因此，这一高涨的群众运动，不仅具有反对资产阶级侵蚀这一根本意义，而且具有机关中民主改革的意义。第三、各机关的领导干部和群众，在这一反对资产阶级侵蚀的斗争中，已取得初步经验和显著成果。大批贪污分子已经坦白或被检举出来，贪污行为已为广大群众所憎恨，浪费的风气亦已大大改变，而朴素刻苦的同志，则受到了广大群众的尊重。
    刘景范秘书长接着指出：在已往十九天中，我们取得的成绩很大，但不少贪污犯，特别是大贪污犯，在这一运动中还刚刚开始露头，还未完全突破。机关内部的坦白、检举和工商界的坦白检举的材料还刚刚开始结合。为此，各机关应把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动引向新的高潮。各级领导，应即组织力量、抓住要害，一方面要充分发动群众，同时，要作好调查研究工作，以对大贪污犯展开全面的进攻。
    会议批准了刘景范的报告，并号召中央一级机关，除继续普遍清查贪污、浪费外，应即把主要精力，转入对大贪污犯的斗争。薄一波主任最后并宣布：凡犯有贪污行为者，能在一月二十六日前把自己的问题彻底交代清楚，均作为自动坦白论，除罪大恶极者外，均可酌情从轻、减轻或免予处刑。否则，一定依法严惩。
