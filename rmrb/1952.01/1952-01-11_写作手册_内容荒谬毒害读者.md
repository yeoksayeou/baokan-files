    “Writing Handbook” Contents Absurd, Poisoning Readers
    Comrade Editor: The "Writing Handbook" published by Shanghai Wenwei Bookstore (edited by Zhu Runjiang, revised November 1951 edition) is a crudely made and absurd book. It introduces many stale phrases, which objectively play a role in spreading poison and harming readers. Here, let us cite a few examples:
    The standpoint is wrong, insulting the revolutionary movement. For example, on page 19, there is the saying "A year of war, ten years of unrest." The author did not explain this sentence, which means that he indiscriminately cursed war without distinguishing its nature. On page 23, "Red Sheep Catastrophe" is explained as "military disasters and banditry," which is an open slander against the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement.
    Promoting backward ideas. For example, the phrases "A dog catches mice, meddling in other people's business" (page 16), "Better to be on good terms with a thousand people than to make an enemy of one" (page 28), "Enjoy life while you can" (page 65), "Don't seek merit, just avoid mistakes" (page 138), etc., are not criticized in any way, actually admitting that these ideas are "correct." Promoting such backward ideas will hinder social progress.
    Maintaining feudalism. For example, on page 76, there are "No one knows a son like his father," "Carry on the family tradition," "The young phoenix sings clearly," "Follow in the footsteps of ancestors," etc. The author did not criticize these phrases at all. Is this even slightly in line with the spirit of the Three Great Movements, which require everyone from reactionary families to betray their reactionary families and stand firm on the revolutionary stand?
    In addition, on page 92, there are "The human heart is unpredictable," "You can know a person's face but not their heart," "Different people, different faces," and on page 122, there is "It's easier to change mountains and rivers than to change one's nature," which clearly denies the possibility of ideological remolding, but the compiler did not make any criticism. On page 169, there is the phrase "Let it dry on your face after being spat upon," which expresses the most despicable servile ugliness, but the compiler explains it as "describing extreme patience."
    In short, "Writing Handbook" is an extremely bad book. It is hoped that the editor and publisher of this book will face up to their mistakes and conduct a deep self-examination. Liaoxi Provincial Heishan Middle School Teaching Department
    Editor's note: "Writing Handbook" is a bad book. In addition to the above letter, we have also received letters from the Student Union of Changchun Normal School in Jilin Province and Tong Xixun of Luanping Junior Normal School in Rehe Province, all of which have made serious criticisms of it. It is hoped that the editor and publisher of this book will quickly examine and correct it.

### “写作手册”内容荒谬毒害读者

    “写作手册”内容荒谬毒害读者
    编辑同志：上海文伟书馆出版的“写作手册”
    （朱润江编、一九五一年十一月增订版），是一本粗制滥造、内容荒谬的书。它介绍了许多陈腐语句，在客观上起了散布毒素、毒害读者的作用。这里，让我们稍稍举出几个例子：
    立场错误，污辱革命运动。例如，十九页中有“一年动刀兵，十年不太平”的话，作者对这句话并没有加以解释，这就是说，对战争不辨性质地一概加以咒骂。二十三页中把“红羊浩劫”解释为“兵灾匪祸”，这是对太平天国革命运动的公开诬蔑。
    宣扬落后思想。例如，对于“狗捉耗子，多管闲事”（十六页）、“宁与千人好，莫与一人仇”（二十八页）、“行乐及时”（六五页）、“不求有功，但求无过”（一三八页）等词句，都没有加以任何批判，实际上承认了这种思想是“正确”的。这样宣扬落后思想，是会妨碍社会进步的。
    维护封建。例如七六页中有“知子莫若父”、“克绍箕裘”、“雏凤声清”、“绳其祖武”等，作者对这些词句都没作批判，这难道和三大运动所要求我们的每个出身于反动家庭的人，要背叛反动家庭，站稳革命立场的精神，有丝毫相同之点吗？
    此外，如九二页中有“人心叵测”、“知人知面不知心”、“人心不同，各如其面”，一二二页中有“江山好改，本性难移”，这显然否定了思想改造的可能性，但编书者也没作任何批判。一六九页中有
    “唾面自干”的话，这句话表现的是一种最可鄙的奴才丑相，而编书者却解释为“形容忍耐心太好”。
    总之，“写作手册”是一本极端恶劣的书。希望这书的编者和出版者正视自己的错误，进行深刻的检讨。　辽西省立黑山中学教导处
    编者按：“写作手册”是一本不好的书。除了以上这封信以外，我们还收到吉林省长春师范学校学生会、热河省滦平初级师范佟喜勋的来信，都对它提出严正的批评，希望这书的编者和出版者迅速检查改正。
