    A Friendly Meeting
    ——A Record of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation and the Korean People's Delegation to China Visiting Wounded and Sick Soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in a Certain Hospital in the Capital
    Bai Sheng
    On the morning of January 23rd, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation and the Korean People's Delegation to China visited the wounded and sick soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in a certain hospital in the capital. When Hong Sun-chol, the head of the Korean People's Delegation to China, entered a ward for seriously wounded soldiers in a certain hospital in the capital, he immediately saw Tian Kedong, a seriously wounded comrade whose face was burned. The deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, cemented in blood, made Hong Sun-chol unable to hold back his tears. Comrade Tian Kedong was seriously wounded by enemy aircraft strafing during the Battle of Suwon in the Third Campaign on the Korean battlefield when our army was pursuing the enemy. His left eye has been blinded and his hands have become disabled, but he has a strong fighting heart burning within him. When Hong Sun-chol conveyed the care of Korean people's leader General Kim Il-sung and the Korean people to him, Comrade Tian Kedong said with emotion: "The warm greetings of the Korean people have strengthened my fighting will. My only wish is to return to the Korean front after I recover from my injuries, to perform meritorious service for the motherland and the Korean people, and to completely eliminate the mad aggression of American imperialism."
    In another ward, when Li Xuesan, the head of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation, went to visit the wounded soldier Yu Chuan at his bedside, this wounded comrade, whose waist bone was broken, immediately sat up from the bed with enthusiasm, as if he had met his own relatives, forgetting the pain of his broken waist bone. Li Xuesan asked him kindly about his injuries and repeatedly told him to rest in peace. The meeting of these comrades who had shared hardships and fought together on the Korean battlefield gave the wounded and sick soldiers great comfort and encouragement. The wounded and sick soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Yu Chuan, Li Xiangyuan, Bi Keming, and others, enthusiastically talked about their concern for the Korean battlefield. They were concerned about every battle to annihilate the enemy and every comrade fighting on the Korean front.
    An elderly Korean woman—a model peasant representative and female guerrilla fighter, Wen Yifu—when she visited the wounded soldier Song Kerong, she held his hand and burst into tears before she could even finish a sentence. Wiping away her tears with a handkerchief, she told this convalescing Comrade Song Kerong excitedly: "Several of my relatives were killed by the American bandits, and I sincerely thank you for avenging me and all the people of Korea!" The husband of this elderly Korean woman was originally the chairman (equivalent to the Chinese village head) of Jikdong-ri (Naejikdong), Gomyeon, Sinxi County, Hwanghae Province, Korea, a hardworking and kind peasant who was captured by the American bandits at the height of the Korean War and brutally killed with bayonets along with more than seventy other Korean people. She comforted the wounded soldiers like a loving mother, and when she saw the wounded soldiers, she couldn't help but feel sad again. Comrade Song Kerong comforted her kindly, saying: "Don't be sad, we are all your children, your family. Old woman, we will avenge you and all the people of Korea!"
    On this day, the quiet hospital suddenly became lively. A warm consolation meeting was held in the auditorium. All the wounded and sick comrades who could leave the ward came happily and excitedly. Some were leaning on crutches; some were being supported by nurses; some were sitting in wheelchairs pushed by nurses because they could not walk, and they all rushed to the auditorium. They accepted the greetings from the delegation. Cui Lin, the representative of the wounded and sick soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, said gratefully: "Please convey our regards to Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai. After we recover our health, we will immediately return to the Korean battlefield to perform meritorious service for the people of the motherland and the Korean people, and we will never let down the glorious title of 'the most beloved people' bestowed on us by the people of the motherland."

    友爱的会晤
    ——记志愿军归国代表团、朝鲜人民访华代表团慰问首都某医院志愿军伤病员
    柏生
    一月二十三日的上午，志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团慰问了首都某医院的志愿军伤病员们。当朝鲜人民访华代表团团长洪淳哲走进首都某医院一个重伤员病房的时候，他一眼看到满脸被烧伤的重伤员田克东同志，鲜血凝结在一起的中朝人民的深厚友谊使洪淳哲禁不住地流下泪来。田克东同志是在朝鲜战场第三次战役中的水原战斗时，当我军追击敌人时，被敌人飞机扫射受了重伤，左眼已经失明，双手也成了残废，但他有一颗燃烧着的坚强的战斗的心。当洪淳哲把朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军和朝鲜人民对他的关怀转告给他时，田克东同志感动地说：“朝鲜人民热情的慰问，更加坚强了我的战斗意志，我唯一的愿望就是伤好后，再回到朝鲜前线，为祖国、为朝鲜人民立功，彻底消灭美帝国主义的疯狂侵略。”
    在另一个病房里，中国人民志愿军归国代表团团长李雪三走到伤员于川病床前慰问的时候，这位腰骨被折伤的伤员同志，立即像见到自己的亲人一样，他忘记了自己折伤腰骨的疼痛，热情地从病床上坐起。李雪三亲切地问着他的受伤的情况，一再地嘱咐他要安心休养。这些曾经同艰苦共生死，一起战斗在朝鲜战场上的战友们的会见，使伤病员们获得莫大的安慰和鼓舞。志愿军伤病员于川、李相元、毕克明等热情地诉说着他们对朝鲜战场上的关怀，他们关心着每一个歼灭敌人的战斗和每一个战斗在朝鲜前线的战友们。
    一位朝鲜老大娘——模范的农民代表、女游击队员文义福，她在慰问伤病员宋克荣时，她握住他的手，还没有说完一句话，便哭起来了。她用手帕擦着眼泪，激动地告诉这位休养的宋克荣同志说：“我有几个亲人都被美国强盗杀害了，我衷心地感激你们为我和全朝鲜的人民复仇！”这位朝鲜老大娘的丈夫原是朝鲜黄海道新溪郡高面直洞里
    （内直洞）的委员长（相当中国的村长），一个勤劳善良的农民，在朝鲜战争打得最激烈的时候，被美国强盗们捉住，和其他七十多个朝鲜人民一起被敌人用刺刀残酷地杀害了。她像慈母一样地慰问着伤病员们，她看到了伤病员们，自己又禁不住要难过起来。宋克荣同志亲切地安慰她说：“不要难过，我们都是你的儿女，你的家人。老大娘，我们要为你为全朝鲜的人民复仇！”
    在这一天，安静的医院里突然热闹起来。礼堂里曾经举行过一个热烈的慰问大会。所有能够离开病房的伤病员同志，都愉快兴奋地来了。他们有拄着拐杖的；有由护士扶着的；有的因为不能走路坐着病车由护士推着来的，他们都赶到礼堂里来。他们接受了代表团的慰问，志愿军伤病员的代表崔林感激地说：“请转告金日成、彭德怀两将军，我们恢复健康后，立刻就要回到朝鲜战场上去，再为祖国人民和朝鲜人民立功，绝不辜负祖国人民赠给我们的‘最可爱的人’的光荣的称号。”
