Brief Economic Commentary

Don't Get Entangled in Private Merchants' "Small Favors"

    Some people think it "doesn't matter" to take a cigarette or a meal from a private merchant. Many cadres, under the sway of this "doesn't matter" mentality, are dragged step by step into the mire of corruption by unscrupulous merchants. Today's report in this newspaper about some private merchants in Changchun luring the staff of the Changchun branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company vividly illustrates the insidiousness, baseness, and viciousness of unscrupulous merchants. When they initially established relationships with the company, they "prepared some cigarettes, peanuts, and melon seeds and scattered them on the table," many cadres did not recognize the essence of the bourgeoisie, and did not realize that these cigarettes and peanuts were sugar-coated poison, so "everyone smoked and ate them." These cadres exposed their weaknesses to the unscrupulous merchants, which became the direction and target of the merchants' sugar-coated bullets. Once caught by an unscrupulous merchant, it is difficult to break free. Once they stumble, they change from a cadre of a people's enterprise into a spy sent by the unscrupulous merchant into the people's enterprise. All cadres should, in this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, draw a clear line in their thinking, those who have not been poisoned should get vaccinated, and those who have been poisoned should be rescued quickly, honestly confess, and admit their mistakes to the people. Every cadre must at all times and in all places be fully vigilant against the rampant attacks of bourgeois ideology on revolutionary cadres, and fully recognize its reactionary and ugly side.

    经济生活简评
    别沾私商的“小便宜”
    吸私商一支香烟，吃私商一顿饭，有人觉得这是“无所谓”的事。许多干部就在这种“无所谓”的想法支配下，被奸商一步一步地拖到贪污的泥坑里去了。今天本报发表的长春市部分私商勾引中国煤业建筑器材公司长春分公司工作人员的消息，十分具体地说明了奸商的阴险、卑鄙、恶毒。他们起初和公司建立关系时，“预备些烟卷、花生、瓜子，往桌上一撒”，许多干部不认识资产阶级的本质，不晓得这些烟卷、花生，正是裹着糖衣的毒药，“大家就吸食起来”。这些干部向奸商暴露了自己的弱点，就成为奸商用糖衣炮弹进攻的方向和目标。一次被奸商拿到把柄，要想挣脱就很难了。自己一失足，就由一个人民企业的干部，变为奸商派遣在人民企业里的奸细了。所有的干部都应该在这次反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中，从思想上划清界限，没有中毒的要打预防针，中了毒的要赶快救治，老实坦白，向人民承认错误。每个干部，都必须随时随地充分警惕资产阶级思想对于革命干部的猖狂进攻，充分认识它的反动的丑恶的一面。
