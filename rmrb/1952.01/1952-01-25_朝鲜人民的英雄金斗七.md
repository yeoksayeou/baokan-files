    Kim Doo-chil, Hero of the Korean People
    After the Korean People's Army launched a heroic counterattack against American imperialism and its lackeys, Kim Doo-chil followed his company across the 38th parallel. In the battle to liberate Cheonan, he bravely destroyed two enemy bunkers with hand grenades, captured the enemy's artillery positions, and captured 19 enemy soldiers; he also shot down an American plane with his rifle and captured two enemy pilots. In the battle to liberate Gongju, while attacking the enemy's artillery positions across the Geum River, Kim Doo-chil braved intense artillery fire, rushed to the enemy's position, and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, killing seven enemies with his bayonet; he also captured 29 enemy soldiers, eight 105mm cannons, and 30 trucks. Kim Doo-chil followed his company across the Nakdong River and fought all the way to Cheongdo Mountain, 80 miles from Busan. In the battle to defend Cheongdo Mountain, Kim Doo-chil and his comrades stubbornly resisted the enemy's attacks. When they ran out of bullets, they threw hand grenades, and when they ran out of hand grenades, they threw mortar shells. On August 17th, they repelled the enemy's attacks seventy times in one day.
    Soon after, the People's Army took the initiative to withdraw. At that time, Kim Doo-chil had been promoted to platoon leader. Their troops decided to remain in the enemy's rear area near the 38th parallel to conduct activities. In the harsh winter, they lacked clothing and food, and did not have many weapons, so the regimental commander decided to seize Cheorwon, ordering Kim Doo-chil to lead 27 soldiers as the vanguard to attack Cheorwon. On November 6, 1950, they stormed into Cheorwon Station and occupied the police station. They also broke open a prison and rescued 130 imprisoned Labor Party members and patriotic people.
    Kim Doo-chil was awarded the title of "Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" for his bravery and decisiveness, and received four medals: the Hero Golden Star Medal, the First Class National Flag Medal, the First Class Soldier's Honor Medal, and the Second Class Soldier's Honor Medal.

    朝鲜人民的英雄金斗七
    在朝鲜人民军向美帝国主义及其走狗展开英勇反击以后，金斗七随着他们的连打过了“三八线”。他在解放天安的战斗中，用手榴弹奋勇地炸毁了敌人的两个地堡，占领了敌人的炮兵阵地，俘敌十九名；并用步枪击落一架美机，俘敌驾驶员两名。在解放公州的战斗中，在攻击锦江对岸敌军炮兵阵地时，金斗七冒着猛烈的炮火，冲到敌人阵地，和敌人展开白刃战，用刺刀刺死了七个敌人；并俘敌二十九名，一○五糎炮八门，汽车三十辆。金斗七随着他们的连，渡过洛东江，一直打到离釜山八十里的青道山。在守卫青道山的战斗中，金斗七和他的战友们顽强地抗击敌人的攻击，子弹打光了，就扔手榴弹，手榴弹也打光了，就扔迫击炮弹。在八月十七日，一天打退了敌人的七十次冲锋。
    不久，人民军主动撤退。那时，金斗七已升为排长。他们的部队决定留在“三八线”附近敌后活动。在风雪凛冽的冬季里，他们缺衣缺粮，武器不多，因此团首长决定夺取铁原，命令金斗七带领二十七名战士作为攻打铁原的先遣队。一九五○年十一月六日，他们一鼓攻入铁原车站，占领了警察署。他们又打破一座监狱，救出一百三十名被囚的劳动党员和爱国人民。
    金斗七以他的英勇与果敢荣获了“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄”的称号，并获得四种奖章：英雄金星章、一级国旗勋章、一级战士荣誉奖章和二级战士荣誉奖章。（附图片）
