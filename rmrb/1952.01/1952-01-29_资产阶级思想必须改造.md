    Bourgeois Ideology Must Be Remolded
    Yu Huancheng
    Recently, the nationwide movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has unfolded vigorously and swiftly. This is a very important revolutionary movement. Article 18 of the Common Program clearly stipulates: "Severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, and oppose the bureaucratic style of work of being divorced from the masses of the people." For more than two years, under the leadership of the Communist Party, politics have been clear and bright. However, the toxins left over from the old society are still numerous. In this movement, many facts of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy have been discovered. This is caused by the poison left over from China's old society over thousands of years. In the past, the ruling classes who exploited and oppressed the people lived a life of corruption and decadence for a long time, which became a common practice and was deeply rooted. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, this toxin was further spread, making society even more corrupt. This movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is a thorough cleansing of the toxins left over from the old society, and its revolutionary significance is very significant. In this movement, staunch and unyielding cadres can be commended; and those things that are ghostly and evil must also reveal their true forms, with nowhere to hide. Righteousness grows, and evil diminishes. This is truly something that has never happened in history. This is another victory of the revolution under the leadership of the great Communist Party and Chairman Mao, overcoming the bad habits left over for thousands of years.

    The party leading us—the Communist Party of China—in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, does not conceal the crimes of cadres, makes everything public, and punishes every offense. This is also something that has never happened in history. In the past, the ruling classes in history were themselves the biggest corrupt officials. In the legal codes of past dynasties, there were also provisions for "punishing corruption." Sometimes they also punished a few corrupt officials, but this was not really to punish corruption, but to make a show, decorate the facade, and deceive the people. Therefore, they only swat flies and do not ask about tigers and wolves. The reason why the current struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is so great is first its mass character: acts of corruption are exposed by the masses and confessed to the masses. As the old saying goes, "Ten fingers pointing, ten eyes watching." Now it is a thousand hands and ten thousand hands pointing, a thousand eyes and ten thousand eyes watching. If you have done something wrong, the trade union will expose you; your neighbors will also expose you; even your family members will expose you. There is no way to escape, no hole to drill in heaven or on earth. The second is its nationwide character: mobilizing everywhere, inspecting everywhere, from big cities to the countryside, using vivid facts to carry out a major education to society, so that everyone knows that bad elements must be eradicated, and good cadres must be commended. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, without the new democratic regime, people could not even dream of such a bright and great atmosphere.

    A house should be swept regularly, and a mirror should be wiped regularly. This movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy will surely wash away all the toxins left over from history. I hope that after this movement, we will continue to be vigilant and check constantly to consolidate the achievements of this movement. Because the atmosphere of corruption and decadence has been prevalent in history for too long and too widespread. I believe that to fundamentally eliminate this toxin of the old society, we must carry out ideological remolding, especially the ideological remolding of the bourgeoisie.

    Now it is often said that bourgeois ideology has eroded the cadres. What exactly is bourgeois ideology? Some people doubt that since the bourgeoisie has joined the New Democratic regime of the united front, why is their ideology unacceptable?

    The ideology of the bourgeoisie is to make money wholeheartedly. The more money, the better; the faster, the better. As long as you make more money, you will not hesitate to use any means. Therefore, fraud, bribery, tax evasion, tax avoidance, falsifying accounts, stealing information, speculative hoarding, disrupting the market, etc., anything that can make more money and make money quickly is done. During the rule of the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang reactionaries, hoarding and profiteering were commonplace. Bribery, fraud, falsifying accounts, and tax evasion were regarded as necessary means for business operations. Since liberation, for more than two years, taking advantage of the improvement of industry and commerce and the large number of national construction projects, many industrialists and businessmen have become restless again, using the old methods of the past to attack the cadres of the People's Government, using bribery, flattery, and various sordid and shameless means to seduce cadres to become corrupt in order to carry out their illegal activities. This is an unforgivable and extremely serious crime. I felt very heartbroken when I saw the cases of Liu Qingshan, Song Degui, and others in the newspaper. I feel sorry for the cadres who were deceived and hate the evil of the unscrupulous merchants. There is nothing more to say about these unscrupulous merchants except to punish them according to the law. The root cause of these heinous criminals is to make a lot of money, that is, the idea of huge profits. Therefore, the idea of huge profits is the source of all evil. To transform the ideology of the bourgeoisie, we must first thoroughly eradicate the idea of huge profits.

    Remolding bourgeois ideology is not to eliminate the bourgeoisie, nor is it to immediately implement socialism. The preamble of the Common Program states that the bourgeoisie is one of the four classes in the people's democratic united front. It is precisely because it is listed in the people's democratic united front that its ideology must be worthy of it. If it is still old democratic ideology, it does not conform to the Common Program. All ideas that do not conform to the Common Program cannot be allowed to exist.

    资产阶级思想必须改造
    俞寰澄
    最近全国展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，轰轰烈烈，雷厉风行，这是一个十分重要的革命运动。共同纲领第十八条明文规定：“严惩贪污，禁止浪费，反对脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风”。两年多以来，在共产党的领导下，政治清明。然而旧社会所遗留的污毒，还是很多。在这次运动中，发现了许多贪污浪费及官僚主义的事实。这就是数千年来中国旧社会的遗毒所造成的。过去，剥削和压迫人民的统治阶级，长久地过着贪污腐化的生活，相习成风，根深柢固。国民党反动派统治时代，更加散播了这种毒菌，使社会更加腐烂。这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，是对旧社会所留下的污毒来一次彻底的冲洗，其革命意义，非常重大。在这次运动中，坚贞不拔的干部，都可以得到表扬；而鬼祟邪恶的东西，也不得不显露原形，无处藏躲。正气长，邪气消，真是历史上从未有过的事情。这又是在伟大的共产党和毛主席领导下一次革命的胜利，战胜了几千年所遗留下来的坏风气。
    领导我们的党——中国共产党，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，不为干部隐蔽罪迹，一切公开，有犯必惩，也是历史上从来没有的。过去历史上的统治阶级，自己就是大贪污犯。在历代法典上，也定过“惩治贪污”的条文。有时他们也惩办几个贪污人员，但这并不是真正为了惩治贪污，而是做做样子，装璜门面，欺骗人民。所以专扑苍蝇，不问虎狼。现在的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争之所以伟大，第一是它的群众性：贪污行为，由群众检举，向群众坦白。古语说：“十手所指，十目所视”，现在则是千手万手所指，千目万目所视。做了亏心事，职工会检举你；亲邻也会检举你；甚至你的家属也检举你。上天下地，无路可逃，无洞可钻。第二是全国性：到处发动，到处检查，从大都市直到乡村，用活生生的事实对社会施行一回大教育，使大家晓得坏分子必须铲除，好干部必须表扬。不是共产党的领导，不是新民主主义政权，人们梦也梦不到这样光明伟大的气象。
    屋要常扫，镜要常揩。这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，一定会把历史上所遗留的一切污毒全部洗清。我希望在这次运动之后，还要不断地时常警惕，时常检查，巩固这次运动的成绩。因为贪污腐化的风气，在过去历史上流行得太久了，太普遍了。我认为要根本肃清这种旧社会的遗毒，必须进行思想改造，尤其是资产阶级的思想改造。
    现在常说：资产阶级思想侵蚀了干部。究竟资产阶级是什么思想？有人怀疑资产阶级既加入统一战线的新民主主义政权，为什么他们的思想要不得？
    资产阶级的思想，就是一古脑儿为了赚钱。赚钱愈多愈好，愈快愈好。只要多赚钱，就不择手段。于是欺诈、行贿、逃税、漏税、造假账、偷消息、投机囤积、捣乱市场等等，凡可以多赚钱快赚钱的，都做得出来。在日伪和国民党反动派统治时期，囤积居奇，是家常便饭。行贿、欺诈、造假账、漏税等，视为营业上必要手段。解放以后，两年多以来，趁工商业好转，国家建设工作繁多的时候，许多工商业主又蠢蠢欲动，用过去的老手段，向人民政府的干部进攻，用行贿、谄媚、奉承种种龌龊无耻的手段，引诱干部腐化，以进行他们的非法活动，这是不可饶恕的极大罪恶。我从报上看到刘青山、宋德贵等案件，感觉到非常痛心。痛干部之受愚，恨奸商之怙恶。这种奸商，除了尽法以惩，更无第二句话可说。这些罪大恶极的奸徒，归根结底就是要赚很多的钱，即暴利思想。所以暴利思想是万恶之源。资产阶级改造思想，首先必须对暴利思想痛加铲除。
    改造资产阶级思想，不是取消资产阶级，也不是立即实行社会主义。共同纲领序言载明资产阶级是人民民主统一战线的四个阶级之一。正是因为同列人民民主统一战线，思想必须配得上。假使还是旧民主主义思想，那就不符合于共同纲领。一切不合乎共同纲领的思想，都是不能容许其存在的。
