Self-Criticism Regarding Extravagance and Waste in the Reception of the People's Bank of China Head Office Inspection Team
Zhang Haotian, President of the Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China

(I)
    The Chinese People's Bank of China Henan Branch's expenses for the reception of participants at the summary meeting held in Kaifeng by the People's Bank of China Head Office Inspection Team were huge, a truly typical example of serious extravagance and waste. It was wrong of us not to have conducted a thorough inspection in the past. Only after the Henan Provincial People's Procuratorate exposed this incident in the Henan Daily and the Henan Daily published a short commentary criticizing it did we truly take it seriously. I sincerely accept the criticisms from the People's Procuratorate and the newspaper, and am willing to make a public self-criticism in the newspaper.

    After hearing the news that the People's Bank of China Head Office had decided to summarize the inspection work of East China and Central South China in Kaifeng City, I was both very happy and very flustered. I felt a heavy burden and didn't know how to prepare for the meeting properly. In preparing for the meeting, I wanted to do my best in the reception work, so I "learned from the big cities," which in reality meant learning extravagance and waste. At that time, the Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China was building a large conference room. After completion, we quickly renovated and repainted the office as a venue. Feeling that the furniture was insufficient, we bought many sofas, desks, and table lamps (in addition to what the Henan Daily had already exposed, there were also sixty enamel spittoons, one hundred and twenty washbasins, three glass cabinets, eight brown beds, one hundred bed boards, and magnetic kettles and bowls, etc.). After the rooms and utensils were almost prepared, I still wanted to make it more "impressive," feeling that this would show our "enthusiasm" to the guests. So we transferred cadres to organize a meeting secretariat, employing more than seventy people just for reception. The waste during the meeting was also significant: the food expenses per person per day increased from eight jin of wheat to twelve jin; accompanying staff ate the same as the leaders; two evening parties and one banquet were organized, costing more than 14 million yuan. After the meeting, we sent each district branch souvenirs of Henan Nanyang specialties such as jade hand seals, jade ink boxes, and jade wine cups, costing a total of 2.5 million yuan. After the meeting, when summarizing the reception work, I even thought it was good. Because I felt that the reception staff had contributed, I blindly gave out awards. In short, the extravagance and waste of this meeting had reached an intolerable level.

    The main reason I made the serious mistake of extravagance and waste in this reception work is that since entering the city, I have been influenced by the ideology and style of the old bank staff, demanding tall buildings, good houses, and many utensils, to look the part. In Kaifeng City, the significant waste phenomenon of the Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China is building too many houses, buying too many cars, and large office expenses. Recently, our organization implemented savings measures and recovered office supplies worth more than 78 million yuan. Without inspecting and overcoming this waste phenomenon, I neither considered the problem from a political perspective nor committed the mistake of bureaucracy in this reception work. For example, after forming the meeting secretariat, I just delegated the task and stopped asking about it, letting it run its course, not knowing how much was bought or how much money was spent, resulting in an expenditure of more than 250 million yuan, causing huge losses to state property. In reviewing this, I am deeply pained. I hereby request the provincial party committee, the provincial government, and the leadership of the higher-level bank to give me appropriate punishment. I will accept the lessons from this incident and strive to protect state property, practice strict economy, accumulate funds for economic construction, and conduct a thorough self-criticism in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, promote democracy, to correct my personal bureaucratic style and extravagant and wasteful thinking and behavior.

(II)
    After reading the opinions about the serious extravagance and waste of the Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China published in the Henan Daily on December 31st last year and January 1st this year, I believe that these criticisms and the analysis of the problem are correct, helping me to understand the problem more deeply. This kind of extravagant and wasteful thinking and style is completely a shameful criminal act. At a time when the people of the whole country are making efforts to resist US aggression and aid Korea and struggling arduously, and when the people of the whole country are working hard to produce and actively support the volunteers, our Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China did not use the money where it was most needed, but used it on extravagant and wasteful meeting receptions. This is something that should not have happened and is intolerable to patriotic people.

    Our extravagant and wasteful behavior in receiving the People's Bank of China Head Office Inspection Team has had very bad consequences: state property has suffered huge losses; the prestige of the Party and the government has been undermined; it has had a very bad influence on the masses, hindering the development of national banking business in the future; it has created a very bad impression in the lower-level branches, reducing the leadership's prestige; at the same time, this behavior is also a destruction of economic policy, giving speculators an opportunity to take advantage of. These tangible and intangible losses are enormous.

    What kind of thinking is dominating our extravagance and waste? First of all, I should examine myself. I came from a petty-bourgeois intellectual background, I like vanity, and I want my house to be bright, clean, and decorated with calligraphy and paintings. In the past, this was impossible in a war environment, but after entering Wuhan in 1949 to take over the pseudo-bank, conditions were met. The house there was very good, and the utensils were exquisite, so I made the house clean and beautiful, learning the bourgeois lifestyle. In Wuhan, there were many meetings and banquets, and I went to other places to attend meetings several times, and the receptions in various places were very elaborate. The banquets were very lively. Although I couldn't get used to it, I also envied those who were good at socializing. I was deeply saddened that I couldn't socialize, and I felt that I should learn from them, forgetting the past hard struggle. I was transferred to the Henan Branch with such thoughts and emotions.

    After arriving in Kaifeng, I saw that the branch's house was not good, the equipment was simple, and it was not as good as other agencies, so I wanted to repair it. At that time, other cadres in the bank also had extravagant and wasteful ideas, and they also demanded to repair the house and catch up with other agencies. Before the arrival of the Head Office Inspection Team in Kaifeng, the branch was building a conference room, so we also renovated the office. Under such leadership and cadre thinking, our extravagance and wasteful emotions erupted in the preparatory work for the Head Office Inspection Team's summary meeting; coupled with bureaucratic leadership, the extravagance and waste of this meeting became even more uncontrollable.

    At that time, I was determined to do a good job in the reception work of the meeting, learn the reception methods of big cities, and try to satisfy the guests as much as possible. At this time, the people's interests, national concepts, and the Party's position were all forgotten. I was completely dominated by bourgeois thought. At that time, I was also afraid that the cadres below would not have experience and would not do a good job. After the Central South District Bank came to arrange, I let go and did not care. In particular, I did not raise the issue of saving and pay attention to the impact. At that time, I only listened to reports and participated in discussions, but did not ask about the specific work. Until long after the meeting ended, I did not know how much the meeting cost or how much was bought, and the bureaucracy reached its extreme.

    Did I recognize the extravagance and waste of this meeting at the time? I also recognized it; but because I thought the meeting was of great significance and there were many gains, I blurred my understanding of the seriousness of extravagance and waste. People who attended the meeting encouraged us a few words, which further confused our heads, and we did not recognize the seriousness of this behavior for a long time, and did not make a self-criticism, which is completely wrong. In fact, I did not realize that: we could have held this meeting well without such extravagance and waste.

    The criticism and education of me in the newspaper in the past few days has made me sober, recognized the mistake of extravagance and waste and the crime of harming state property and endangering the people's interests; recognized the seriousness of the corruption of bourgeois thought since I entered the big city. We guarantee that in this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, we will make good use of democracy, deeply examine our own thinking and style, eliminate the influence of bourgeois thought, and be responsible for doing a good job in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the agency, in order to thoroughly eliminate the extravagance and waste phenomenon of the provincial branch, overcome our bureaucratic style, improve the working style of the general cadres, and establish the national bank's style of hard work and simplicity, honesty and integrity, and serving the people.

    My self-criticism may not be deep enough, I hope comrades will continue to give me help and criticism, and ask the provincial party committee, the provincial government, and the higher-level bank to give me the punishment I deserve.

    关于招待中国人民银行总行视察团铺张浪费的检讨
    中国人民银行河南省分行行长　张皓天
    （一）
    这次中国人民银行总行视察团在开封召开总结大会，中国人民银行河南分行对参加大会人员的招待费用，开支浩大，实在是严重铺张浪费的典型例子。过去我们没有进行深刻的检查是不对的。这一事件经河南省人民检察署在河南日报揭发、河南日报发表短评作了批评之后，我们才真正重视起来。我诚心诚意地接受人民检察署和报纸的批评，愿意在报纸上作公开的检讨。
    我听到中国人民银行总行决定在开封市总结视察华东、中南两区工作的消息之后，一方面很高兴，一方面很慌张。我觉得负担很重，不知怎样给大会作筹备工作是好。在作筹备工作中，我想尽量把招待工作作好，于是“向大城市学习”，实际上是要学习铺张浪费。当时中国人民银行河南分行正在建筑大的会议室，完工后，就赶紧把办公室修整、油饰一新，作为会场。还觉得家具不够，就又买了许多沙发、办公桌子和台灯等（除河南日报已经揭发的以外，还有洋瓷痰盂六十个，脸盆一百二十个，玻璃柜三个，棕床八张，铺板一百付，以及磁壶、磁碗等）。房屋用具预备得差不多了，还想搞得“排场”些，觉得这才显得对客人“热心”。于是抽调干部组织了大会秘书处，光招待人员就用了七十多人。会议进行过程中的浪费也是很大的：每人每日伙食费由八斤小麦增加到十二斤；随从人员和首长一样吃；组织了两个晚会，一次会餐，花费了一千四百多万元。会后又送给各区行以河南南阳特产玉手章、玉印色盒、玉酒杯等作为纪念品，共花费二百五十万元。会后总结招待工作，我还认为不错。因为觉得招待人员有功，又盲目地发奖。总之，这次会议的铺张浪费已经达到了不能令人容忍的程度。
    我在这次招待工作中所以犯了严重铺张浪费的错误，主要是自进城以来，受了旧银行工作人员思想作风的影响，要求楼高，房子好，用具多，像个样子。在开封市，中国人民银行河南省分行显著的浪费现象是盖房子多，买汽车多，办公费用大。最近我们机关实行节约，就收回了价值七千八百多万元的办公用品。对这种浪费现象没有检查、克服，所以在这次招待工作中，既不知道从政治原则上考虑问题，又犯了官僚主义的错误。如在组成大会秘书处之后，就把任务交代一下，不再过问了，任其自流，既不知买了多少东西，也不知花了多少钱，以致开支了二亿五千多万元，使国家财产遭受了巨大的损失。检讨起来，深为痛心。我谨请求省委、省府和上级银行的领导方面给我以适当处分。接受这一事件的教训，今后我一定爱护国家财产，厉行节约，为经济建设积累资金，并在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，深刻检讨，发扬民主，以纠正个人的官僚主义作风和铺张浪费的思想行为。
    （二）
  　读了去年十二月三十一日和今年一月一日河南日报所载关于读者对中国人民银行河南省分行严重铺张浪费的意见以后，我认为这些批评意见和对问题的分析都是正确的，帮助我对问题的认识更深刻了一步。这种铺张浪费的思想和作风，完全是可耻的犯罪行为。在今天全国人民努力抗美援朝艰苦斗争的时候，在全国人民努力生产积极支援志愿军的时候，我们中国人民银行河南分行不是把钱用在最需要的地方，而是用在铺张浪费的大会招待上，这是不应有的事情，是爱国人民所不能容忍的事情。
    我们招待中国人民银行总行视察团的铺张浪费行为，造下了很坏的恶果：国家财产遭受了巨大损失；破坏了党和政府的威信；给群众以很坏的影响，妨碍了今后国家银行业务的开展；在下级支行中造成很坏的印象，降低了领导威信；同时，这种行为也是对经济政策的破坏，给投机商人以可乘之机。这些有形的和无形的损失是极大的。
    到底是什么思想支配着我们这样铺张浪费呢？首先应该从我个人来检查。我是小资产阶级知识分子出身，喜欢虚荣，愿意自己住的房子是明窗净几，书画点缀。过去，在战争环境中这是不可能的，但一九四九年进入武汉接收伪银行以后就有了条件。那里的房子很好，用具精致，我就把房子弄得整洁漂亮，学起资产阶级的生活方式来。在武汉时，会议多，宴会多，几次到外边开会，各地招待得都很讲究。酒席宴会弄得很热闹。自己虽然看不惯，但也羡慕人家会交际。自己不会应酬，深以为憾，觉得应当向他们学习，忘记了过去艰苦斗争的情形。我就是带着这样的思想情绪被调到河南分行来的。
    来到开封以后，看到分行的房子不好，设备简陋，比不上其他机关，于是就想修理一下。当时行内其他干部也有铺张浪费的思想，也是要求修理房子，赶上其他机关。在总行视察团来开封以前，分行正在建筑会议室，就顺便把办公室也修理一新。在这样的领导思想和干部思想情况下，在总行视察团总结大会的筹备工作中，就爆发了我们的铺张浪费的情绪；加上官僚主义的领导，这次会议的铺张浪费越发不可收拾了。
    当时我一心要把大会招待工作搞好，学习大城市的招待办法，尽量做到使客人满意。这时，人民利益，国家观念，党的立场都被忘记了。我完全被资产阶级的思想所支配。当时还怕下面的干部没有经验，搞不好，以后中南区行来人布置，自己就放手不管了。特别是没有提出节约问题和注意影响。到时候自己只听报告，参加讨论，而不问具体工作情况。一直到大会结束很久，自己也不知道会议花了多少钱，买了多少东西，官僚主义达到极点。
    对于这次会议的招待，当时是不是已经认识到铺张浪费了呢？也认识到了；但因认为大会意义重大，收获很多，又模糊了对铺张浪费严重性的认识。参加会议的人对我们鼓励了几句，更冲昏了我们的头脑，很久不认识这一行为的严重性，也没有检讨，这是完全错误的。实际上我是没有认识到：不这样铺张浪费也能开好这个会议。
    这几天报纸上对我的批评和教育，已使我清醒起来，认清了铺张浪费的错误和损害国家财产、危害人民利益的罪行；认识了自己进入大城市以来受资产阶级思想腐蚀的严重性。我们保证在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中很好地发扬民主，深刻地检查自己的思想作风，肃清资产阶级的思想影响，并负责把机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动搞好，以求彻底肃清省分行的铺张浪费现象，克服我们的官僚主义作风，改进一般干部的工作作风，把国家银行艰苦朴素、廉洁奉公、为人民服务的作风树立起来。
    我的检讨恐怕还不够深刻，希望同志们继续给我帮助和批评，并请省委、省府和上级行给我以应得的处分。
