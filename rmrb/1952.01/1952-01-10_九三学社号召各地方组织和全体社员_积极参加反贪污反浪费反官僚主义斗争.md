To establish a Thrift Examination Committee, recommending Xu Deheng and others as members.

The Jiu San Society Thrift Examination Committee was formally established on December 28, 1951. At the inaugural meeting, Xu Deheng emphatically pointed out: "Anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy are the most important combat tasks for the people of the whole country after the victorious high tide of suppressing counter-revolutionaries." He called on local organizations and all members to immediately mobilize and implement the following tasks:

	I. Launch a study of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, treating this movement as an important part of ideological remolding.

	II. Local branches and sub-branches should immediately establish Thrift Examination Committees or Thrift Examination Groups to regularly promote the increase production and practice thrift movement, and launch a long-term struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Each branch should conduct inspections of the affiliated institutions and businesses, using democratic methods for criticism and self-criticism, especially to check for corruption and waste. Efforts should be made to eliminate bureaucracy and red tape in leadership styles and work styles. When carrying out this work, leading comrades must personally take action, conduct thorough mobilization, and encourage everyone to conduct inspections, reports, and self-criticism with a loyal, honest, serious, and responsible attitude. Then, based on the actual situation, formulate plans for increasing production and practicing thrift for institutions and individuals, and actively improve working systems and methods.

	III. All sub-branches and grassroots groups in institutions and schools should immediately mobilize their members to actively participate in and promote the increase production and practice thrift movement in their respective institutions and schools, as well as the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and play an active leading role in this movement and struggle.

	IV. Local branches, sub-branches, and members should widely conduct propaganda and education related to increasing production, practicing thrift, and combating corruption, waste, and bureaucracy among the masses they are connected with, so that this work becomes a broad mass movement.

Committee members present, including Wang Zhi and others, spoke enthusiastically, unanimously expressing their determination to mobilize all members and the masses they are connected with to vigorously launch this movement, and resolutely eliminate corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.
