Tianjin's Industrial and Commercial Circles Mobilize Against Corruption and Bribery

Tianjin Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee's Federation of Industry and Commerce branch held a mobilization meeting on the 4th to respond to the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Approximately two thousand people attended, including directors, committee members, and group leaders from various industry associations in Tianjin. Li Zhinan, Deputy Director of the United Front Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and representatives from various industrial trade unions were also invited to attend the meeting.

At the meeting, Li Zhuchen, Director of the Tianjin Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee's Federation of Industry and Commerce branch, delivered a mobilization report. He pointed out that some industrialists and businessmen had incorrect views on the significance of this movement, believing that this movement was only the affair of government agencies and enterprise departments, and had "nothing to do" with themselves, that "industrialists and businessmen cannot be corrupt," nor was there any "waste of state property." Some people, although they knew that others had engaged in bribery, were unwilling to report them, fearing to "offend" people. Those who had themselves engaged in bribery were afraid of losing "face" if they confessed, fearing being pursued for losses and receiving punishment; not confessing or reporting, they feared that the bribe-takers would confess them, and therefore felt uneasy. Li Zhuchen affirmed that the above ideas were incorrect. He emphasized that the formation of corrupt and degenerate behavior by cadres in government agencies and enterprises was, of course, due to the pursuit of pleasure by individualistic thoughts, but mainly because they were induced by the backward side of the bourgeoisie – the vile practices of disregarding the interests of the entire people, being profit-driven, and being selfish, and therefore industrialists and businessmen could not shirk their responsibility. As for the scope of corruption, he pointed out that it was not limited to bribery, but included all illegal means of stealing state wealth to enrich oneself, or harming the interests of the people in pursuit of illegal profits. For example, Li Shaobo of Xinhua Trading Company stole state secrets through bribery, hoarding goods that were about to rise in price for high-price sales, and rushing to sell goods that were about to fall in price. Furthermore, some industrial and commercial households established separate books, concealed their turnover, or falsely reported as merchants, and other various methods to deceive the government and evade taxes. Some manufacturers falsely reported costs and cut corners in processing or fulfilling orders, seriously damaging the interests of the state. He said that industrialists and businessmen must recognize that bribery and tax evasion are acts of corruption, which must be eliminated in order to build a strong and prosperous new China.

Li Zhuchen called on Tianjin's industrialists and businessmen to bravely and sincerely confess their bribery, and actively report bribe-takers. He believed that confessing and reporting bribery was a concrete manifestation of loving the motherland. Only by sincerely confessing can it be shown that the national bourgeoisie and the people are of one mind, and establish a sense of ownership of the new China under the leadership of the working class. He said that industrialists and businessmen are people who have been influenced by the old society for a long time, and more or less have bad habits from the old society. Now, the people are giving us the opportunity to confess, and industrialists and businessmen should quickly throw off their heavy burdens, confess themselves, and bravely report bribe-takers. He said that this would not only raise the consciousness of industrialists and businessmen themselves, but also save others. Industrialists and businessmen should no longer have a mentality of侥幸 (expecting to get away with it), because bribery is a two-way street. If you don't confess, the bribe-taker will report you, and then it will be too late to regret. He called on industrialists and businessmen, especially members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and directors or group leaders of various trade associations, to take the lead in mobilizing everyone to confess and report, in order to motivate others.

Li Zhinan, Deputy Director of the United Front Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, was invited to speak at the meeting. He said that since listening to Mayor Huang Jing's report and studying relevant documents, Tianjin's industrialists and businessmen have further improved their political understanding, and many people who have bribed in the past have voluntarily confessed and reported bribe-takers. This behavior is correct and will play a very good role in the entire movement. However, some people still have the idea of "wait and see" and "getting through it," which is unnecessary. Then, he further emphasized that the specific work that industrialists and businessmen should do in this movement is to wash away the following stains: first, using bribery to entice state cadres, second, using deception to evade state taxes, and third, using speculation, cutting corners, and reducing materials to seek illegal profits in processing orders. He said that only after we in the industrial and commercial circles have completely eliminated these three stains can we become industrialists and businessmen who truly serve the people and advance together with other revolutionary classes. He called on everyone to pay attention to this fact. He said that those who have the above three behaviors should not wait any longer. They should conduct denunciations and confessions, those who confess voluntarily can have their crimes reduced if they are serious, and those who are minor can be exempted from punishment.

Li Zhinan explained some unnecessary ideological concerns that exist in the industrial and commercial circles. He said that some industrialists and businessmen believe that confessing and reporting is shameful. However, in the new society, only those who sincerely review their mistakes can gain the sympathy and love of others. Some people also believe that confessing will offend people and fear retaliation. This concern is also unnecessary, because the People's Government supports the people.

Finally, Wang Weisheng, Director of the Timber Industry Association, and Qi Yushu, Director of the Construction Industry Association, spoke successively, expressing their warm support for the movement. Wang Weisheng used examples of bribery in the industry to illustrate the necessity of launching the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. He also introduced the industry's experience in mobilizing and carrying out this movement, hoping that all industries would actively participate in this movement.

### 天津市工商界动员反贪污反行贿

    天津市工商界动员反贪污反行贿
    【新华社天津六日电】天津市节约检查委员会工商联合会分会在四日举行动员大会，响应反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动。到会的有天津市各行业同业公会的主任委员、委员、小组长等共约二千人。中共天津市委员会统一战线工作部副部长李之楠和各产业工会代表也应邀参加大会。
    会上，市节约检查委员会工商联合会分会主任李烛尘作了动员报告。他指出：有一些工商业者对这
    一运动的意义有不正确的看法，认为这个运动只是政府机关和企业部门的事，与自己“无干”，“工商业者没法贪污”，也没有“浪费国家资财”。有的人虽然知道别人行过贿，但不肯检举，怕“得罪”人。有自己行过贿的，怕坦白出来丢了“面子”，怕追偿损失，受处分；不坦白、不检举又怕受贿人把自己坦白出来，因此，心里忐忑不安。李烛尘肯定地说：以上的想法都是不正确的。他强调指出：机关、企业干部贪污腐化行为的形成，固然是贪图享受的个人主义思想作祟，但主要的是因为受了资产阶级的落后的一面——不顾全体人民利益、唯利是图、自私自利的卑劣作风的引诱，因而工商业者不能推卸责任。至于贪污的范围，他指出：不仅限于行贿受贿，凡是以不法手段，盗取国家财富以自肥，或为追求非法利润而损害了人民利益的，都是贪污行为。如鑫华贸易行李少伯通过行贿窃取国家机密，将要涨价的货物抢购囤积起来高价出售，把要落价的货抢先甩卖出去。又如一些工商业户另立后账，隐瞒营业额，或以自己营业假报行商等多种多样的方法蒙蔽政府，偷漏税款。有的厂商在加工或承做定货时虚报成本，偷工减料，严重地损害了国家利益。他说：工商业者必须认清：行贿和偷漏税款等都是贪污行为，必须加以清除，以建设富强的新中国。
    李烛尘号召天津市工商业者勇敢地、真诚地坦白自己的行贿行为，并积极检举受贿者。他认为：坦白和检举行贿受贿行为是热爱祖国的具体表现。惟有真诚坦白，才能说明民族资产阶级和人民是一条心，在工人阶级的领导下树立起新中国的主人翁态度。他说：工商业者都是在旧社会里受了长期薰染的人，或多或少地存在着旧社会不良的作风。现在，人民给我们以坦白的机会，工商业者应赶快丢掉沉重的包袱，自行坦白，并勇敢地检举受贿者。他说：这样不仅提高了工商业者本身的觉悟，同时也挽救了别人。工商业者不应再存幸免的心理，因为行贿是双方面的事，你不坦白，受贿人会检举你的，那时，将后悔莫及了。他号召工商业者，特别是工商业联合会委员和各业公会主任委员或小组长等带头，发动大家起来坦白、检举，以便带动别人。
    中共天津市委员会统一战线工作部副部长李之楠应邀在会上讲话。他说：天津市工商业者自从听了黄敬市长的报告和学习了有关文件以后，政治认识有了进一步提高，不少过去行贿的人都自动坦白和检举了受贿者。这种行为是正确的，对整个运动会起很好的作用。但有些人还存有“等一等再说”和
    “过关”的思想，这是不必要的。接着，他进一步强调指出：工商业者在这次运动中应做的具体工作，是洗刷以下的污点：首先是用行贿来引诱国家干部，其次是用欺骗方法来偷漏国家税收，和在承做加工定货时用投机取巧、偷工减料的方法来牟取非法利润。他说：我们工商界把这三项污点彻底清除以后，才能成为真正为人民服务的工商业者，才能和其他革命阶级一同前进。他号召大家重视这个事实。他说：凡有以上三种行为的人，不要再等待了。应当去进行检举和坦白，自动坦白的，罪重的可以减罪，罪轻的可以免罪。
    李之楠对目前工商界中存在的一些不必要的思想顾虑进行了解释。他说：有的工商业家认为坦白检举是丢人的事。但是在新社会里，只有真心诚意检讨错误的人才能得到别人的同情和爱戴。还有的人认为坦白出来会得罪人，恐怕报复。这种顾虑也是不必要的。因为人民政府是为人民撑腰的。
    最后，木商业公会主任委员王伟生和营造业公会主任委员齐玉书相继发言，表示热烈拥护这个运动。王伟生用该业的行贿实例说明了开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的必要性。他并介绍了该业动员和开展这一运动的经验，希望各行业积极参加这个运动。
