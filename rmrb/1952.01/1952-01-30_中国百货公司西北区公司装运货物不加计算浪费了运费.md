    China Department Store Northwest District Company Wastes Freight Due to Careless Shipment Calculations
    Last September, the China Department Store Northwest District Company was shipping goods to the Northeast and other regions. Due to the staff's carelessness and lack of careful calculation of actual weight and measurement, goods that could have been transported in two freight cars were loaded into three, wasting 20 million yuan in freight costs. Furthermore, glass being shipped to Baoji (whose freight rate is calculated based on 30 tons) was mixed with other items such as cigarettes, enamelware, and paper (whose freight rate is calculated based on 22 tons), resulting in a waste of more than 1.52 million yuan in freight costs. This practice of wantonly wasting state property should be corrected immediately.

    中国百货公司西北区公司装运货物不加计算浪费了运费
    中国百货公司西北区公司在去年九月份调往东北等地货物，因工作人员粗枝大叶，没有认真计算实际重量和度量，以致使两个车皮就可装运的货物，装了三个车皮，浪费了运费二千万元。又把运往宝鸡的玻璃（路局的运价按三十吨位计算）和其他香烟、搪瓷、纸张（路局运价按二十二吨位计算）等混装一起，也浪费了运费一百五十二万多元。这种随意浪费国家财产的作风，是极应纠正的。
