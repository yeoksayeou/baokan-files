    The Quartermaster Department of the North China Military Region Logistics Department Should Reasonably Compensate Transport Workers' Wages
    To the Editor: On December 4th of last year, we accepted a delivery order from the Materials Section of the Quartermaster Department of the North China Military Region Logistics Department to transport 500,000 blue bricks from the Jianguo Brick Kiln. The transportation fee for these bricks was 65 million yuan. From the 6th to the 13th, we transported all the bricks. We sent Ma Long to the department's construction site to obtain a receipt in order to settle the account. The site supervisors, Wang Jingsheng and Gao Yilin, refused to issue a receipt, claiming that many of the 500,000 bricks were cut in half. We went to the Thirteenth District People's Court to seek a resolution. The court ruled that the construction site should issue a receipt for 485,000 bricks and a separate receipt for 15,000 broken bricks. The next day, the site supervisors still refused to comply with the ruling, only issuing a receipt for 15,000 half-cut bricks. We were left with no choice but to send Ma Long back to the Materials Section of the construction site to collect payment. Yuan Zhijie, the head of the Materials Section, reviewed our triplicate delivery form and insisted on deducting the price of 15,000 bricks from the transportation fee for the 485,000 bricks. However, we workers are only responsible for transportation and not for the quality of the bricks. We have repeatedly negotiated with the Materials Section of the construction site, but to no avail. They have adopted a firm attitude of not accepting our opinions and refuse to settle the account. We request that this disregard for the lives of workers not continue.

    华北军区总后勤部营房管理部  应合理偿付运输工人的工资
    编辑同志：去年十二月四日，我们接受华北军区总后勤部营房管理部材料处提货单一件，承运从建国砖窑发出的五十万块蓝四丁砖。这些砖的运费是六千五百万元。自六日到十三日，我们运完全部的砖。我们派马龙到管理部工地取收料单，以便算账。工地负责人王景生、高宜林不开收据，他们说在五十万块砖中，有许多对截的。我们就到十三区人民法院去要求解决这件事。法院判决叫工地按四十八万五千块砖开收料单，再开一个一万五千块断截砖的收条。第二天，工地负责人仍不按判决办理，只开了一张一万五千块对截砖的收条。我们没法，再派马龙到工地材料处取款。材料处处长袁治杰看了我们的三联单，认为在四十八万五千块砖的运费中，还要扣除一万五千块的砖价。但是，我们工人只管运输，不能管砖的质量的好坏。我们屡次向工地材料处交涉，始终没有结果。他们以坚决不接受意见的态度，不给清账。我们要求不要把这种不重视工人生活的情况再继续下去。
