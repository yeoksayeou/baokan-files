(New China News Agency, Paris, 3rd) TASS reports: All morning newspapers reported that Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, has authorized his ambassador to Beijing to send a telegram to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, requesting that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam be allowed to join the United Nations.

In addition to this request, the telegram from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's ambassador to Beijing to the UN Secretary-General also protested France's policy of supporting the Bao Dai puppet "government's" application to join the United Nations.

"L'Humanité" pointed out: The French people differ from the French government; they support Ho Chi Minh's request that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam be allowed to join the United Nations because its government is the sole legitimate representative of the interests of the Vietnamese people.

    越南民主共和国要求加入联合国
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎三日讯：所有的晨报都报道：越南民主共和国政府主席胡志明已授权他的驻北京大使致电联合国秘书长赖伊，要求允许越南民主共和国加入联合国。
    除了这个要求外，越南民主共和国驻北京大使给联合国秘书长的电报还表示抗议法国支持保大傀儡“政府”申请参加联合国的政策。
    “人道报”指出：法国人民和法国政府不同，他们支持胡志明的要求，即：允许越南民主共和国加入联合国，因为它的政府是越南人民利益的唯一合法的代表。
