    I Realized That Technicians Can Only Do Their Jobs Well by Thoroughly Transforming Their Thinking
    Comrade Editor: In early April of last year, I came to the Northeast full of enthusiasm. I was assigned to work at the Fushun Mining Bureau by the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government. I felt that the living conditions were inferior to those in Shanghai in every aspect, which caused my thinking to waver, and I even wanted to ask for a long leave to go home. This spring, I was ordered to go to the North Manchuria site to prepare for work. After arriving at the construction site, because the living conditions there were even worse than in Fushun, my thinking became even more unsteady. I repeatedly requested a long leave from my superiors. After work began, a large number of employee comrades came to the construction site. A large-scale construction project was launched. I saw that they were all in high spirits, which I found very strange. I had not yet realized that I was a person with backward thinking. In July, after studying the report of Minister Wang Heshou of the Ministry of Industry, I began to realize that we technicians must establish the viewpoint of serving the people, and that technicians can only improve their skills by going deep into the field and combining with the work experience of the workers; relying solely on book knowledge is not enough. After that, I gradually became more active in my work. Last September, I accepted the rationalization proposal put forward by veteran worker Huo Jinshan and saved more than 60 cubic meters of wood, which gave me a deeper understanding of the above principles. After the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy was launched, I further realized that in order to do our own work well, we technicians also need to examine our lifestyle. Therefore, we technicians must actively participate in the great ideological transformation movement, master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and thoroughly transform our thinking. Only in this way can we contribute more to the cause of building the motherland.

    我认识了技术人员只有彻底改造思想才能做好工作
    编辑同志：去年四月初，我怀着满腔热情来到东北。我被东北人民政府工业部分配到抚顺矿务局工作。我感到生活条件处处不如上海，因而在思想上发生了动摇，甚至想请长假回家。今年春天，我奉命到北满现场准备工作。到达工地后，因为那里生活条件更不如抚顺，我的思想也就更加动摇了。我数次向上级提出请长假的要求。开工以后，大批职工同志来到工地。大规模的修建工程展开了。我看到他们都兴高采烈，感到非常奇怪。我还没有认识到自己是一个思想落后的人。七月间，学习了工业部王鹤寿部长的报告，我开始认识到我们技术人员必须建立为人民服务的观点，并且认识到技术人员只有深入现场，和工人的工作经验相结合，才能提高自己的技术；单凭书本上的知识是不行的。此后，我才对工作逐渐积极起来。去年九月，我接受了老工人霍金山同志提出的合理化建议，节省了六十多立方公尺木材，对于以上的道理，有了更深刻的体会。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开以后，我又进一步认识到我们技术人员为搞好自己的业务，还需要检点自己的生活作风。因此，我们技术人员必须积极参加伟大的思想改造运动，掌握批评和自我批评的武器，彻底改造自己的思想。只有这样，我们才能够为建设祖国的事业，贡献更大的力量。
