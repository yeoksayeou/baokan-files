    Suggestion to Hold Exhibitions on Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy in Various Places

    Editor: In order to make the great anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement more widespread and in-depth, I suggest that the relevant leading departments in various places, as far as possible, combine with the development of the movement to hold some large-scale exhibitions.

    I think the content of this exhibition can include: (1) Photos of major corrupt elements,赃物, and the number of embezzled assets. (2) The tricks used by big profiteers to entice cadres (written or in comic strip form), altered and falsified receipts and accounts, etc., as well as charts showing the proportion of losses suffered by the people and the country's wealth when big profiteers pursue exorbitant profits. (3) The huge losses caused by bureaucrats. For example: charts of the wealth lost by various units due to shelving the rationalization proposals of workers and cadres, and the opportunities created for profiteers to cut corners due to the failure to inspect construction work in a timely manner.

    建议各地举办反贪污浪费反官僚主义的展览会
    编辑同志：为了使伟大的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开展得更普遍深入，我建议各地有关领导方面，尽可能地结合运动的发展情况，举办一些规模较大的展览会。
    我认为这种展览会的内容可以包括：（一）有关大贪污分子的照片、赃物和贪污财物的数目字等。（二）大奸商们引诱干部的手腕（书面写出或连环画），涂改和假造的单据、账目等，以及大奸商们在追逐暴利时使人民、国家财富受损失的数目的比例图表。（三）官僚主义者造成的巨大损失。如：各单位搁置工人、干部们的合理化建议，因没有及时检查修建工作给奸商们造成偷工减料机会而损失的财富的图表等。　　杨绍汉
