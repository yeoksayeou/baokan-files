    The extravagant lifestyle and the “dictatorial” style of the big embezzlers Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan were opposed by many party members and cadres from the very beginning. However, due to various difficult conditions, the forms of opposition were different: the first was to directly oppose their practices; the second was to harbor dissatisfaction, and if they didn't encounter them, then so be it, but if they did, they would confront them on certain occasions; the third was to have opinions, and often express dissatisfaction, but not dare to put the opinions on the table. I belonged to the first category.
    The more significant instances of my struggle against them are as follows:
    The first time was in September 1950, when they wanted to divert 1 billion yuan of local grain to invest in the production of the organization. At that time, I was attending a tax collection work conference in the province. After I came back, I heard that they had used local grain. I immediately found Zhang Zishan and told him: "Our district has suffered from continuous disasters, many schools have collapsed, and rivers and canals must be repaired. Under no circumstances can local grain be used for the production of the organization." His reply was: "It will be withdrawn soon." After a few days, I learned that they had not withdrawn it, so I went to Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan again and asked them what they planned to do with the grain and why they hadn't withdrawn it yet. Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan said to me: "The higher authorities have approved it, and local grain can be invested in the production of the organization." They also stated: "It will not delay local expenditures." I knew they were dissatisfied with me. Later, I prepared to ask the higher authorities whether they had really permitted them to do so.
    The second time was in January 1951, regarding the supply of labor for river management. After returning from the spring construction conference in the provincial government, I told the cooperative in Tianjin to prepare to supply the river workers, and the cooperative quickly prepared the necessary equipment. When I told Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan about this, they immediately said to me: "The cooperative has a big task, they should face the members," and proposed to organize a separate supply station. At that time, I disagreed and said that supplying river workers was an obligation, and it would be wrong to treat supplying migrant workers as a way for the organization to make money. Zhang Zishan also said at the time that it shouldn't be done. Therefore, they did not absolutely reject my opinion at that time. But at some point, Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan told the cooperative that they didn't need them to do it, and they transferred more than eighty cadres from the prefectural party school to organize the supply station. They personally arranged it and demanded that 3 billion yuan be earned in the supply work. I opposed their illegal behavior of mobilizing the party organization—the vanguard of the proletariat—to guarantee that they would exploit migrant workers for 3 billion yuan.
    The third time was when they used the Longshun Construction Factory to buy off technicians from Anshan and other places. The relevant authorities in Anshan sued the Tianjin Municipal People's Court and published it in the Tianjin Daily. At that time, I was attending the County Party Secretary Joint Meeting in the prefectural committee office. At this time, Liu Qingshan called Zhang Zishan from Tianjin to say that he wanted to solve the problem by treating people to dinner. Zhang Zishan did not object. Later, during the exchange of opinions, I firmly advocated returning the workers, compensating for the losses, apologizing to the other party, and reporting the whole truth to the higher authorities for them to study and handle. Zhang Zishan also agreed at the time; but he insisted that I go to Liu Qingshan to talk about this opinion. I found Liu Qingshan and put forward my opinion. Liu Qingshan expressed anger and had a very bad attitude. He said: "I am personally responsible. I will not leave until this mess is cleared up (at that time he had been transferred), I will not let you clean up the mess." I said: "It won't work to solve it by treating people to dinner." After I came back, he and Comrade Liu Ben and others cursed me vigorously.
    The fourth time was when they defrauded 2 billion yuan in loans in the name of building houses. That was in July 1951. Zhang Zishan told the commissioner's office to write a certificate. I sternly refused on the spot and went to the prefectural committee office to find Zhang Zishan and asked them why they didn't build houses but wanted to defraud loans in the name of building houses? Later, I heard that the prefectural committee office wrote a certificate.
    The fifth time was last August when they used 1 billion yuan of river work funds. At that time, I was in the organization, and Zhang Zishan told me three times, and I refused to do so. The next day, I heard that he had "seized the village" and still took the river work funds away. I went to him again and said: "Why are the river work grains that are earmarked for special purposes also being used for the production of the organization?" He said: "It will be returned in ten days." When I returned to Tianjin in early October after attending the North China County Head Conference, I heard that he had used 2 billion yuan of river work funds again. Zhang Zishan was in Tianjin at the time. I found him and said: "I am going to report the use of river work grain to the province." He said: "Report it if you want, I am personally responsible." As a result, a stalemate was formed. I thought the situation was getting worse and worse. At first, they pretended to discuss it with me, and then they adopted a way of hiding it from me. They told the county to use local grain without telling the commissioner's office, only with verbal approval, without forming any written documents. They told Kang Guangyu, who was in charge of the production of the organization: "I am the head, you are only allowed to talk to me about things." Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan also told Liu Ben: "You are not allowed to tell Li Kecai about the production of the organization." In the end, they became even more rude and unreasonable, just muddling through without asking, and if you asked them, they would say "I am personally responsible."
    Liu Qingshan had not done any work since he came to the Tianjin Special Zone. Zhang Zishan had also been running around and not working since June last year. I thought they had indeed deteriorated, and I felt that I could no longer tolerate it, so I made up my mind to tell the higher authorities about their problems head-on. In order to attract the attention of the higher authorities and enable the problem to be resolved, I actively and consciously learned about their situation and reported it to the higher authorities. When the higher authorities sent an inspection team to inspect the production of the organization, Zhang Zishan took a perfunctory approach and made arrangements. I went to Tianjin again and talked to the inspection team: I wanted them to be serious and responsible and conduct a thorough inspection. After two months of inspection, the situation was clarified. The two traitors Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan were arrested. The struggle representing the will of the vast majority of party members and the masses was victorious. This is the victory of the whole party and the whole people under the leadership of Chairman Mao. After the recent anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the vast number of party members and cadres have further recognized and exposed the crimes of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan in betraying the party and the people, sharply criticized the harm of bureaucracy and decadent liberalism to the party and the people, and laid a good foundation for improving the leadership of the Tianjin area and welcoming the upcoming economic construction tasks.
    In this struggle of principle, I have shortcomings: First, in the case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan's extreme individualism and dictatorial actions, most party members and cadres did not dare to speak, and they tried every means to deceive and deceive the higher authorities, which made me think that the frontal struggle could not solve the problem, and I had the idea of simply "relying on the higher authorities." When the higher authorities could not solve the problem immediately, I repeatedly asked to leave this area and took a liberal attitude. I thought that their mistakes would always break out one day, therefore, prolonging the time to solve the problem and causing more losses to the party and the people. Second, Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan's personal dictatorship created a feudal order with no democracy in the party, and most of the prefectural committee members did not dare to speak. I did not more actively and more positively put the problem on the table for struggle, but only relied on the higher authorities to solve it, so the solution of the problem was prolonged.
    I deeply experienced that the call for anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy put forward by Chairman Mao is very correct and great. I also experienced that sound democratic life within the party is a guarantee for doing a good job. The reason why Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan's crimes developed to such a serious point is because various systems and democratic life within the party are not sound.

    我是怎样和叛徒刘青山张子善作斗争的
    李克才
    大贪污分子刘青山、张子善在生活上的铺张浪费和作风上的个人“专制独裁”，一开始就遭到了许多党员、干部的反对。不过因为种种的困难条件，所以在反对的形式上不一样：第一种是直接了当地反对他们的作法；第二种是心怀不满，遇不上便罢，遇到了就在一定场合和他们碰一碰；第三种是有意见，也时常表示不满，但不敢把意见放在桌面上。我是属于第一种的。
    我和他们进行斗争，比较重大的有以下几件：
    第一次是一九五○年九月，他们要挪用地方粮十亿元投入机关生产。当时我在省里参加徵收工作会议，回来后听说他们动用了地方粮，当时我就找到张子善和他讲：“我区连年灾荒，学校垮台的很多，河渠又必须修治，无论如何不能把地方粮用到机关生产上去。”他的回答是：“很快就抽出来。”过了些日子，我了解到他们并没有抽出来，我就又找到刘青山和张子善，问他们这批粮食打算怎么办，为什么还不抽出来？刘青山、张子善对我说：“已经上级批准了，地方粮可以投入机关生产。”他们还表示：“误不了地方开支。”我知道他们对我是不满意了。后来我就准备问问上级，是否真的许可他们了。
    第二次是在一九五一年一月，为治河民工的供应问题。我由省府开春工会议回来，在天津就告诉了合作社作供应河工的准备，并且合作社很快地就筹置了用具。我回来对刘青山和张子善他们一说，他两个当时就对我说：“合作社任务大，他们应该面向社员”，并提出要单独组织供应站。当时我不同意，并说供应河工是义务，要是把供应民工当成机关生产去赚钱就是错误的。张子善当时也说是不应该。因此，当时他们并没有绝对拒绝我的意见。可是不知什么时候，刘青山和张子善就告诉合作社说：不用他们搞了，他们从地委党校里抽调了八十多个干部把供应站组织起来了。他们并且亲自布置，要求在供应工作中赚三十亿元。我反对他们这种动员党的组织——无产阶级先锋队保证给他们剥削民工三十亿元的非法行为。
    第三次是：他们利用隆顺营造厂收买鞍山等地的技术人员，鞍山有关机关向天津市人民法院起诉，并在天津日报上发表了。当时我正在地委办公室参加县委书记联席会议，这时刘青山从天津给张子善打电话来表示：要用请客的办法解决这个问题。张子善并没有反对。后来在交换意见时，我坚决主张把工人退回，赔偿损失，向对方道歉，并把全部真相报告上级，请上级研究处理。当时张子善也同意了；但是他硬让我去找刘青山，谈这个意见。我找到刘青山把意见提出来，刘青山当时表示气愤，态度十分坏，他说：“我个人负责，这摊子弄不清我不走（那时他已被调动），不让你们擦屁股。”我说：“你用请客办法解决不行。”我回来以后，他便和刘本等同志大肆咒骂我。
    第四次是他们以盖房名义，骗取二十亿元的贷款。那是一九五一年七月的事，张子善告诉专署写证明文件，当场我严词拒绝，并到地委机关找到张子善，问他们为什么不盖房，却要拿着盖房子的名义骗取贷款？后来听说地委机关写了证明文件。
    第五次是去年八月他们动用十亿元河工款。当时我在机关，张子善连和我说了三次，我都拒绝了他们这样做。第二天，我听说他倒庄，还是把河工款夺走了。我又去找他说：“专款专用的河工粮，为什么也拿到机关生产上去？”他说：“十天就拿回来。”我在十月初参加华北县长会议回到天津时，又听说他动用了二十亿河工款。当时张子善正在天津，我找到他说：“我要把动用的河工粮上报到省里。”他说：“你报就报，我个人负责。”结果形成了僵局。我认为情况愈来愈恶化了，开始他们是假意和我商量，后来就采取瞒着我的办法。他们告诉县里动用地方粮，不用告诉专署，只用口头批准，不形成文字。告诉机关生产人员康光宇说：“我是头，有事只许和我谈。”刘青山和张子善也曾告诉刘本说：“机关生产的事情，不许告诉李克才。”最后他们竟更蛮横不讲理，不问就混过去，你要问他们，他就说“我个人负责”。
    刘青山从到天津专区以来，就没有作什么工作。张子善从去年六月以后也就东奔西跑不作工作了。我认为他们确实已经变质，我觉得再也不能容忍下去了，于是就下了决心，把他们的问题正面地告诉了上级。我为了能引起上级注意，使问题能获得解决，我主动地、有意识地了解他们的情况，向上级作了报告。当上级派来检查组检查机关生产时，张子善是采取了应付的手段，并作了安置。我又到天津和检查组谈：要他们认真负责彻底检查。经过两个月的检查，情况是弄清了。刘青山和张子善两个叛徒是被逮捕了。代表绝大多数党员、群众意志的斗争，是胜利了。这是在毛主席领导下全党全人民的胜利。广大党员干部经过最近反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的开展，更进一步认识和揭发了刘青山、张子善背叛党背叛人民的罪行，尖锐地批判了官僚主义和腐朽的自由主义对党对人民的危害，使今后改善天津地区的领导和迎接即将到来的经济建设任务，打下了良好的基础。
    在这场原则性的斗争中，我是有缺点的：第一、在刘青山、张子善极端个人主义专制独行的情况下，大多数党员干部不敢说话，他们又百般蒙蔽欺骗上级，致使我认为正面斗争解决不了问题，产生了单纯“依靠上级”的想法。在上级不能马上解决问题时，我又几次要求离开这个地区，采取了自由主义态度。认为他们的错误总会有一天暴发，因此，拖长了解决问题的时间，给党给人民招致了更多的损失。第二、刘青山、张子善个人专制独行，在党内制造着毫无民主的封建式的秩序，多数地委委员不敢讲话。我没有更主动地更积极地把问题搬到桌子面上来进行斗争，只是依靠上级来解决，所以使问题的解决延长了时间。
    我深深地体验到，毛主席提出的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的号召是非常正确而伟大的。也体验到健全党内民主生活是把工作做好的保证。刘青山、张子善罪行所以发展到这么严重的地步，就是因为各种制度和党内民主生活不健全。
