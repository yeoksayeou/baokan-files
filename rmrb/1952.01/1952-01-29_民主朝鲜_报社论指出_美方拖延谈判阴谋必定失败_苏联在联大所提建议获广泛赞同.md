Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 27th: The "Democratic Korea" newspaper published an editorial on the 24th entitled "The Early Realization of a Korean Armistice is a Prerequisite for Eliminating the Danger of a New War," stating that to maintain world peace and security, it is necessary to thwart the attempt by the US aggressors to transform Korea into a military base for their attack on the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, whether a Korean armistice can be achieved has become a major concern for peace-loving people around the world. However, the rulers of US imperialism and its North Atlantic bloc countries have not abandoned their conspiracy to delay or even sabotage the armistice negotiations, attempting to expand the aggressive war.

The editorial writes: The US side vainly attempts to gain in the armistice negotiations what they failed to achieve in the war, but they have failed again. Therefore, they resorted to threats and intimidation, saying they would continue to argue with us using cannons, bombs, and bullets. Sure enough, they dispatched combat aircraft to illegally invade the airspace of Northeast China and carried out barbaric bombing. The editorial points out that the US side's repeated implementation of its tactics of delaying negotiations and threatening our side is to continue and expand the war, in order to accelerate their arms race and obtain more of their bloody war profits.

The editorial concludes: A Korean ceasefire is an effective way to resist the arms race of the warmongers and prevent a new war, and it is also an important step in strengthening friendly relations between the people of all countries. Therefore, the proposals made by the Soviet delegation at the United Nations General Assembly are all related to the Korean issue. These just proposals have received the support and endorsement of many member states, and the full support of peace-loving people all over the world. The efforts of the Soviet delegation and the determination of the people all over the world are all for eliminating the danger of a new war.

The war-mongers' vicious plan to sabotage armistice negotiations and expand aggression is doomed to failure. The Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world will do everything possible to achieve a Korean armistice and continue to defend world peace with all their strength.

    “民主朝鲜”报社论指出
    美方拖延谈判阴谋必定失败
    苏联在联大所提建议获广泛赞同
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】“民主朝鲜”报二十四日以“朝鲜停战的早日实现是消除新战争危险的前提条件”为题，发表社论称：要维护世界和平与安全，就必须粉碎美国侵略者变朝鲜为其进攻中华人民共和国和苏联的军事基地的企图。因此朝鲜停战的能否实现，已成了全世界爱好和平人民最关心的大事。但是美帝国主义及其北大西洋集团国家的统治者们，却仍未放弃其拖延甚至破坏停战谈判的阴谋，企图扩大侵略战争。
    社论写道：美方妄想在停战谈判中取得它们在战争中所未能取得的东西，但是它又失败了。于是它们又拿出了威胁恫吓的手段，说要用大炮炸弹和子弹来和我方继续辩论。果然他们就派遣作战飞机非法侵犯了中国东北的领空，并进行了野蛮的轰炸。社论指出：美方再三施行其拖延谈判和威胁我方的战术，是为了继续并扩大战争，以便加速进行他们的军备竞赛，更多地取得其血腥的战争利润。
    社论最后写道：朝鲜停火是抵制战争贩子们的军备竞赛和防止新战争的有效方法，同时也是加强各国人民间的友好关系的一个重要步骤。因而苏联代表团在联合国大会上所提出的提案，都和朝鲜问题有关。这些公正的提案，受到了许多会员国的支持和赞同，受到了全世界爱好和平人民的全力支持。苏联代表团的这种努力，和全世界人民的这种决心，全是为了消除新战争的危险。
    战争贩子们破坏停战谈判以扩大侵略的凶恶计划是注定要失败的。朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民将尽一切可能，争取实现朝鲜停战，用一切力量来继续保卫世界和平。
