Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor: The letter I sent criticizing "A certain training regiment of the Logistics Department of the Political Department of the Central and South Military Region should not arbitrarily sell supply grain" has been published in the People's Daily on December 6th. This letter is not consistent with the facts.

    First, the figures are incorrect. The original letter stated that in the first half of 1951, the training regiment sold a total of 55,000 jin of supply grain in two instances. This figure was based on what others said at the time, and I did not conduct an on-the-spot investigation myself, which led to an error that is inconsistent with the facts. Second, the original letter incorrectly stated that the training regiment "sometimes sold grain to private merchants." This was because I did not know at the time that the nature of the exchange was public, and I mistakenly described the exchange as private merchants. Third, the original letter stated that the training regiment "used allocation slips as currency in the market for transactions," but in fact, they did not use allocation slips as currency to buy things in the market. This was an exaggeration on my part. Fourth, the original letter stated that the training regiment had 300,000 jin of supply grain for sale, which is also not true. At the time, I only wrote the letter based on a one-sided conversation with Comrade Huang Kuangzhao of the grain company. This is my mistake. Please correct the previous letter.

    赵梦麟对不负责任的批评的检讨
    编辑同志：我寄去的批评“中南军区政治部后勤处某教导团不应随意变卖供给粮”的信，已在人民日报十二月六日发表。这封信是不符合事实的。
    一、数字不符。原信中说，一九五一年上半年教导团两次共卖了五万五千斤供给粮，这个数字当时是根据别人说的，自己没有去实地调查，因此发生了和事实不符的错误；二、原信中错误地说，教导团把粮食“有时变卖给私商”。这是由于我当时不知道交易所的性质是公营的，把交易所误说成私商；三、原信中说教导团“把拨条当做货币在市场上做交易”，其实他们并没有把拨条当货币在市场上购买东西，这是我形容得过火了；四、原信中说教导团有三十万斤供给粮出卖，也不是事实。当时我只是片面地根据粮食公司黄匡兆同志的谈话就写了信。这是我的错误。并请你们对前信更正。
