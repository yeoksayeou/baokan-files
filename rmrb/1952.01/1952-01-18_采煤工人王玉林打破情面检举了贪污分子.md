    Coal Miner Wang Yulin Breaks Through Sentimentality to Report Corrupt Elements

    Editor: After listening to Bureau Chief Feng's report on anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, Wang Yulin, a coal miner at the Jingxi Mining Bureau, was restless for four or five days. One evening, he returned home and lay on the bed without saying a word. His wife, noticing his recent strange behavior, asked him, "Have you been quarreling with anyone lately?" He said, "It's all about our fellow villager, Wang Shanqing. Last March, I went to Old Wang's house and saw him drinking with two businessmen. When the businessmen left, they left five million yuan, saying it was for the children to buy clothes. At the time, he told me that if it weren't for him, these two businessmen wouldn't have been able to do more than two hundred million yuan in business. I know this is bribery, but I used to benefit from him, and he introduced me to this job. Now I'm in a dilemma. If I report him, I'm afraid I'll be letting him down; if I don't report him, I feel like I'm letting Chairman Mao down!" His wife said, "There's no wall that doesn't leak. The longer you delay reporting, the longer you'll be uneasy. Moreover, reporting it is not only good for the country, but also good for Wang Shanqing himself. What else are you worried about?" After hearing these words, Wang Yulin felt more and more that he should do so. He didn't even eat dinner and rushed to the mine to report Wang Shanqing's illegal activities to the mine manager.

    采煤工人王玉林打破情面检举了贪污分子
    编辑同志：京西矿务局采煤工人王玉林听了冯局长关于反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的报告后，接连四、五天心神不安。一天晚上，他回到家里，一言不发地躺在床上。他的老婆觉得他近来行动很怪，就问他：“你这几天和谁闹蹩气？”他说：“还不是为了咱们老乡王善卿的问题。去年三月，我到老王家去，看见他正和两个商人喝酒。商人们走时还留下五十万元，说是送给小孩买衣服的。当时他对我说，要不是他，这两个商人就不能做两亿多的买卖。我知道这是受贿行为，但是过去我曾受过他的好处，这里的工作还是他介绍的。现在我很为难，要检举，又怕对不住他；不检举，又觉着对不住毛主席！”他的老婆就说：“天下没有不透风的墙，你一天不检举，就一天不能安心。而且，检举出来不但对国家有好处，对王善卿本人也有好处。你还有什么顾虑的？”听了这些话，王玉林越想越应该这样做。他连晚饭也不吃，就急忙地去矿里，向矿长检举了王善卿的非法行为。　金刚
