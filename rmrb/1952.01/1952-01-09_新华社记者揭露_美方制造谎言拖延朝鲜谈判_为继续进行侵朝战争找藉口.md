Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 8th: This correspondent reports: On the subcommittee for the third item on the agenda of the Korean armistice talks, the American representatives' foolish tactics to delay negotiations have reached an impasse. They have fantastically fabricated a lie that the Korean and Chinese side transported a large number of boxed airplanes from outside of Korea, and tirelessly repeated this lie at the meeting for three consecutive days. They want to use this laughable lie to deceive world public opinion, cover up their refusal to accept the Korean and Chinese side's proposal to ensure the stability and effectiveness of the Korean armistice, and defend their aggressive demands to interfere in Korean internal affairs. At the third item agenda subcommittee on the 7th, our representative General Xie Fang severely denounced the American side for fabricating such ridiculous and baseless lies, and pointed out: This is a planned slanderous action.

The facts since the discussion of the third item on the agenda are: The American side not only insists on continuing to bring military forces into Korea from outside after the Korean armistice, demanding unlimited replenishment of weapons and ammunition; during the armistice negotiations, the American side has already transferred the 45th Division of the American invading army from Japan to Korea. This was also openly admitted by the American representative Turner at the subcommittee on the 6th. General Xie Fang pointed out: The purpose of the American side's fabrication of lies is to delay and undermine the armistice negotiations and find an excuse for the American side to continue the war in Korea. He questioned Turner: Didn't your side openly say that cannons, bombs, and bullets should be used for debate? Didn't your side openly admit to increasing military forces in Korea during the negotiations? Haven't you already transferred troops from Japan in an attempt to continue the war in Korea? Turner avoided answering these questions with conclusive evidence.

At the meeting on the 7th, General Xie Fang also severely denounced the American side for deliberately reversing right and wrong and attempting to change historical facts. At the subcommittee meeting on the 5th, General Xie Fang listed the ironclad facts of American military aircraft bombing Andong and other places, American military artillery shelling Ji'an, and American military occupation of Taiwan to refute the American side's so-called "Sino-American friendship" fallacy. At the meeting on the 7th, the American representative Turner read a pre-prepared speech, shamelessly attempting to deny these facts that are already known to the people of the world. General Xie Fang immediately raised the fact that the American representative to the United Nations, Austin, admitted that American aircraft bombed Andong to question Turner. The American general, who said a minute ago that this did not happen, hurriedly argued that it was an "accidental" event. General Xie Fang said to Turner: Your arbitrary denial cannot convince anyone, just as your past denials of all violations of the Kaesong neutral zone cannot be believed. This can only prove your lack of sincerity in the negotiations.

    美方制造谎言拖延朝鲜谈判  为继续进行侵朝战争找藉口
    【新华社开城八日电】本社特派记者报道：在朝鲜停战谈判会议第三项议程的小组委员会上，美方代表拖延谈判的愚蠢手段达到了山穷水尽的地步。他们竟异想天开地捏造了一个所谓朝中方面从朝鲜境外运入大批装箱飞机的谎言，并不厌其烦地接连三天在会上重复这个谎言。他们想用这种不值一笑的谎话来蒙蔽世界舆论，掩饰他们拒绝接受朝中方面提出的保证朝鲜停战稳定和有效的方案的行为，并为他们坚持干涉朝鲜内政的侵略性要求作辩护。我方代表解方将军七日在第三项议程小组委员会上痛斥美方制造这种可笑的、毫无根据的谎话，并指出：这是有计划的污蔑行动。
    第三项议程讨论以来的事实是：美方不仅坚持在朝鲜停战后继续从朝鲜境外进入军事力量，要求无限制地补充武器和弹药；就在停战谈判进行期间，美方已将美国侵略军第四十五师从日本调到朝鲜。这是美方代表滕纳在六日的小组委员会上也公开承认了的。解方将军指出：美方制造谎言的目的在于拖延和破坏停战谈判，为美方在朝鲜继续进行战争寻找藉口。他质问滕纳说：你方不是公然说要叫大炮、炸弹和子弹去进行辩论吗？不是公然承认在谈判期间增加在朝鲜的军事力量吗？不是已经由日本调进军队企图继续在朝鲜进行战争吗？滕纳对这些证据确凿的问题，避不答复。
    在七日的会议上，解方将军并痛斥美方故意颠倒是非，企图改变历史事实。解方将军在五日的小组会上曾列举美军飞机轰炸安东等地、美军炮火轰击辑安以及美军霸占台湾等铁的事实，来驳斥美方的所谓“中美友好”的谰言。在七日的会上，美方代表滕纳读了一份在会前准备好的发言，厚颜无耻地企图抵赖这些已为世界人民所共知的事实。解方将军立即提出美国驻联合国代表奥斯汀承认美机轰炸安东的事实来质问滕纳。在一分钟前还说没有这回事的美国将军，又连忙诡辩说这是“偶然”的事件。解方将军对滕纳说：你方的武断抵赖是不能叫任何人相信的，正像你方过去对侵犯开城中立区的一切抵赖不能取信于人一样，这只能证明你方缺乏谈判的诚意。
