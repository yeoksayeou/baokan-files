    Generating Telegrams Should Strive for Conciseness
    The Southwest Regional Branch of the People's Bank of China, during a waste inspection, discovered that some comrades did not carefully consider and strive for conciseness when sending telegrams, resulting in waste. For example, a telegram sent by the Business Department to Yunnan on November 15th of last year, originally 26 characters, could have been reduced to 12 characters; a telegram sent by the Accounting Department to the Central Bank Treasury on December 1st, originally 154 characters, could have been reduced to 52 characters. In both of these cases, the number of characters could have been reduced by more than half. I calculated that if we save an average of one-third of the characters in telegrams, the entire bank could save 50 million yuan in telegram expenses out of an annual telegram expenditure of approximately 150 million yuan.

    发电报应当力求文字精简
    中国人民银行西南区行，在检查浪费中，发现向外发电报时，有些同志没有深思熟虑，力求精简，以致有浪费现象。如业务处去年十一月十五日发云南的电报，原文二十六字，就可改为十二字；会计处十二月一日发中央总行金库电，原文一百五十四字，也可改为五十二字。以上两电，都可减省二分之一以上的字数。我算了一下：如平均按节省三分之一的电报字数计算，全行在每年开支约一亿五千万元的电报费中，就可节省电报费五千万元。
