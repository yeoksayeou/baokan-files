The ideological remolding learning movement is being enthusiastically launched among university teachers in the Chongqing area. To unify and strengthen leadership over this movement, the "Chongqing Area University Teachers' Study Committee" was established at the end of last December, with Chu Tunan, director of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee's Culture and Education Committee, as its director. With the exception of some teachers who left to participate in land reform, more than 1,600 teachers remaining in the schools have all signed up to participate in the study.

Since liberation two years ago, university teachers in the Chongqing area have made considerable progress in their political thinking. However, they still harbor reactionary feudalistic and comprador ideologies; some teachers even spread reactionary remarks. The enlarged meeting of the Third Plenary Committee of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee's Culture and Education Committee, held in late November 1951, exposed and criticized these erroneous and reactionary ideas. After the meeting, teachers in various schools began to prepare for the study, drawing on the experiences of teachers in Beijing and Tianjin universities, establishing study organizations and formulating study plans. Many teachers have begun to conduct preliminary self-examination in light of their own thoughts and work; many teachers have published articles in newspapers, making self-criticisms and expressing their determination to remold themselves. He Lu, chairman of the Chongqing University Affairs Committee, said in his self-criticism that he had been standing still and refusing to make progress in the two years since liberation, and that his original old ideas had not only remained unchanged but had even grown in some respects. This thinking has prevented him from doing a good job in university administration. He stated that in this ideological remolding movement, he would be determined to eliminate all kinds of erroneous ideas, learn Marxism-Leninism, and wholeheartedly do a good job in the school. Many teachers also painfully reviewed their erroneous ideas, recognizing that their past teaching work had had a very bad influence on young people. They expressed that in this study, they would adopt an attitude of being responsible to the people and to the country, discard their bad ideas and bad habits, so as to better serve the people.

The study time for university teachers in the Chongqing area is tentatively set at four months to half a year. The learning methods are listening to reports, reading documents, conducting self-examination in connection with one's own thoughts and work, and conducting criticism and self-criticism. Teachers in various schools have now begun to read Chairman Mao's "Combat Liberalism," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and other documents.

The Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China expressed a warm welcome to the self-education and self-remolding movement launched by university teachers in the Chongqing area; and dispatched a group of Party member cadres to assist teachers in various schools in their studies, and decided to organize some cadres with a higher level of political theory to give reports on ideological remolding to the teachers.

    重庆区高等学校教师展开思想改造运动
    重庆区高等学校教师热烈展开思想改造学习运动。为了统一和加强对这一运动的领导，去年十二月底成立了“重庆区高等学校教师学习委员会”，由西南军政委员会文化教育委员会主任楚图南任主任。各校除一部分离校参加土地改革的教师外，留校教师一千六百多人全部报名参加学习。
    重庆区各高等学校教师解放两年来，在政治思想上已有不少进步。但他们仍存在着反动的封建主义思想和买办思想；部分教师甚至还散布反动言论。一九五一年十一月下旬召开的西南军政委员会文化教育委员会第三次全体委员会扩大会议，对这些错误的和反动的思想，进行了揭发和批判。会议结束以后，各校教师就开始进行学习的酝酿和准备工作，并吸收北京、天津高等学校教师学习的经验，分别成立学习组织和拟定学习计划。许多教师开始联系自己的思想和工作进行初步检查；不少教师已在报纸上发表文章，进行自我检讨，表示改造的决心。重庆大学校务委员会主任委员何鲁检讨说：他在解放两年来，故步自封，原来的旧思想不但原封未动，反而有某些滋长。这种思想影响使他不能把学校行政工作做好。他表示：在这次思想改造运动中，要下决心扫除各种错误的思想，学习马克思列宁主义，全心全意做好学校工作。不少教师也痛切地检讨了他们的错误思想，认识到他们过去的教学工作对青年起了很坏的影响。他们表示要在这次学习中，采取对人民负责，对国家负责的态度，将自己的坏思想、坏作风抛掉，以便更好地为人民服务。
    重庆区各高等学校这次学习的时间暂定为四个月到半年。学习方式是听报告，阅读文件，联系自己思想和工作进行检查，展开批评和自我批评。各校教师现已开始阅读毛主席的“反对自由主义”、“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”等文件。
    中共中央西南局对重庆区各高等学校教师展开自我教育和自我改造运动，表示热烈的欢迎；并抽调一批党员干部，协助各校教师进行学习，并决定组织一部分政治理论水平较高的干部分别向教师们作思想改造的报告。　　　（新华社）
