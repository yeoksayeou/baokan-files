National State-Owned Enterprise Assets Inventory and Capital Verification Committee

Instructions on Carrying Out Capital Verification Work in State-Owned Enterprises During the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign

On December 28th of last year, the National State-Owned Enterprise Assets Inventory and Capital Verification Committee of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council issued instructions on carrying out capital verification work in state-owned enterprises during the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. The full text is as follows:

I. At present, the work of inventorying assets and verifying capital in state-owned enterprises is underway, but development is uneven. Those who have attached importance to and firmly grasped the work of inventorying assets and verifying capital, closely relied on the working masses, mobilized all employees, and achieved close cooperation between the Party, administration, trade union, and the Communist Youth League, have made great achievements. The main manifestations of these units' achievements are: a large number of off-the-books assets have been cleared up, and a large amount of usable equipment has been picked out from waste materials; serious phenomena of capital backlog have been exposed, and capital management and financial systems have been initially improved; the supply system mentality, parochialism, and "almost good enough" mentality that hinder the establishment of the economic accounting system have been criticized; the understanding of the economic accounting system has been strengthened among enterprise leaders and all employees, and the political consciousness of the working masses has been improved. On this basis, these units, in the great Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, combined with the preparation of the 1952 plan to carry out capital verification work, can correctly verify capital and lay a solid foundation for the implementation of the economic accounting system. However, some units' leaders do not pay attention to this work, nor have they mobilized the masses, and the achievements are very small, and they should catch up quickly.

II. Increase production and practice economy are the basic sources of increasing capital accumulation, and saving capital is an important part of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. Strict capital saving requires first verifying enterprise capital, and then carrying out capital management, so that capital can be used most effectively and rationally.

In order to carry out capital verification work in a leadership-led, planned, and step-by-step manner in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, all state-owned enterprise departments should immediately conduct a practical inspection of the actual use of circulating funds in 1951 and the actual implementation results of consumption quotas; and immediately, based on the 1952 production control figures, formulate from top to bottom the 1952 annual average and fourth quarter circulating fund control amounts and turnover periods (including the required quotas and turnover periods of total funds, as well as the quotas and turnover periods of various funds), and formulate various measures to save capital, submit them to various enterprise units for discussion, and mobilize the masses to calculate the overall accounts, calculate the detailed accounts, and find shortcuts, so that more capital can be saved, capital turnover can be accelerated, and then, combined with the formal preparation of the 1952 circulating funds and fixed asset plans, carry out capital verification work. (If enterprises are carrying out democratic reforms, they should start and complete the above work after the democratic reforms)

Draft control figures for circulating funds and their attached calculation data for all enterprises under the central ministries, if not yet submitted, should be submitted to this committee for verification before January 5, 1952. Draft control figures for circulating funds and their attached calculation data for all enterprises under the major administrative regions and the five provinces of North China should be submitted to this committee for verification before January 15.

III. In order to accelerate capital turnover and save circulating funds, each enterprise department should, according to its own specific circumstances, propose various measures and methods from the following four aspects to accelerate capital turnover:

A. Pertaining to the scope of supply: such as determining the scope of supply for upstream and downstream departments, verifying the funds of the supply departments, shortening the time for procurement, transportation, inspection, storage, and distribution, conscientiously formulating consumption quotas, implementing the material requisition and return system, etc., handling stagnant materials quickly and effectively according to the plan (separate instructions will be issued).

B. Pertaining to the scope of production: such as improving technical operations, improving labor productivity, rationally organizing production, adopting assembly line operations as much as possible, shortening the interval time between operations, improving output and quality, and striving to reduce costs.

C. Pertaining to strengthening sales: such as developing sales business, promoting the contract system, shortening the time for inspection, transportation, storage, packaging, and dispatch.

D. Pertaining to settlement: strictly establishing a bank settlement system, complying with the monetary management system, abolishing commercial credit and internal transactions between enterprises, quickly sorting out uncleared debts, and strengthening monetary fund management.

IV. All enterprise departments that have not entered the asset inventory and valuation stage should, in conjunction with the 1951 year-end final accounts, seize the opportunity at the end of the year to conduct an inventory and valuation of current assets. Fixed assets must also be inventoried, and appraisal and valuation work should be completed at an appropriate time. This will not only facilitate the accounting of financial costs in 1952, but also save manpower and time. Those who conduct an inventory at the end of the year can compile capital verification reports based on the current state of assets at the end of the year.

If the asset inventory and valuation work of each enterprise system has been fully completed, it can immediately compile a balance sheet and a register of fixed assets and current assets, and submit them for verification first. Units that have not completed or have not yet started should submit a copy of the 1951 year-end financial statements to this committee first.

    全国国营企业清理资产核定资金委员会
    关于国营企业在增产节约运动中展开核定资金工作的指示
    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会全国国营企业清理资产核定资金委员会在去年十二月二十八日发出关于国营企业在增产节约运动中展开核定资金工作的指示，全文如下：
    一、目前国营企业清理资产核定资金工作虽在进行，但发展不平衡。凡重视并抓紧清理资产核定资金工作，紧紧地依靠工人群众，发动全体员工，取得了党、行政、工会、青年团的密切配合的，都做出了很大成绩。这些单位的成绩主要表现在：清理出大批账外资产，在废料中拣出了大量的可用器材；揭露了严重的资金积压现象，初步改进了资金管理和财务制度；批判了阻碍经济核算制建立的供给制思想、本位主义思想和“差不多”思想；加强了企业领导方面和全体员工对经济核算制的认识，提高了工人群众的政治觉悟。在这个基础上，这些单位在伟大的增产节约运动中，结合编制一九五二年计划来展开核定资金工作，定可正确地核定资金，为实行经济核算制打下坚实的基础。但有些单位领导方面不重视这个工作，亦未动员群众，成绩很小，应当急起直追。
    二、增产节约是增加资金积累的基本源泉，节约资金是增产节约运动的一个重要部分。资金的严格节约，首须核定企业资金，从而进行资金管理，使资金得到最有效的合理的运用。
    为了在增产节约运动中有领导、有计划、有步骤地进行核定资金工作，所有国营企业部门应即切实检查一九五一年流动资金的实际运用情况以及消耗定额的实际执行结果；并即根据一九五二年生产控制数字，从上而下地订定一九五二年年度平均的与第四季度的流动资金控制金额和周转期（包括总资金的需要定额和周转期，以及各项资金的定额和周转期），并拟出节约资金的各种措施，交给各企业单位讨论，并发动群众算大账，算细账，找窍门，使资金能更多地节约，资金周转能够加速，然后，结合正式编制一九五二年流动资金与固定资金的计划，进行核定资金工作。（如在进行民主改革的企业，应在民主改革后即着手完成以上工作）
    中央各部所属各企业流动资金控制数字草案及其附属计算资料凡未送来者，概于一九五二年一月五日前报送本委员会核定。各大行政区及华北五省所属各企业流动资金控制数字草案及其附属计算资料应于一月十五日前报送本委员会核定。
    三、为了加速资金周转，节约流动资金，各个企业部门应根据各自特殊情况，从以下四个方面提出各种措施和办法，以加速资金的周转：
    甲、属于供应范围的：如确定上下部门的供应范围，核定供应部门的资金，缩短采购、运输、检验、保管、收发的时间，切实制订消耗定额，贯彻领、退料制度等，迅速而有效地按计划处理呆滞材料（另有指示）。
    乙、属于生产范围的：如改进技术操作，提高劳动生产率，合理组织生产，尽量采用流水作业，缩短作业间的间隔时间，提高产量、质量，努力降低成本。
    丙、属于加强销售方面的：如开展销售业务，推行合同制度，缩短检验、运输、保管、包装、发送时间。
    丁、属于结算方面的：严格建立银行结算制度，遵守货币管理制度、取消企业间商业信用与内部往来，迅速整理未清的债务往来，加强货币资金管理。
    四、凡未进入资产清理与估价的企业部门，应结合一九五一年年终决算，在年末抓紧流动资产的盘点和估价。固定资产亦须加以盘点，并在适当时间内，完成鉴定与估价工作，这样，既利于一九五二年财务成本的核算，也节省了人力与时间。凡在年末进行盘点者，均可以年末资产的现状编列核资报表。
    各企业系统如清产估价工作已全部结束，可即编列资产负债表以及固定资产与流动资产登记表，先行送核。凡未进行完毕或尚未进行的单位，应将一九五一年年终财务决算，先行报送本委员会一份。
