Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th. Our correspondent reports: The day after we protested the U.S. aircraft bombing of the Kaesong neutral zone on the 17th, the opposing air force violated the agreement once again, brazenly bombing and strafing our delegation's vehicles. At 4:40 PM on the 18th, U.S. aircraft attacked a convoy of three vehicles belonging to the Korean-Chinese delegation en route from Pyongyang to Kaesong near the Hanpo Bridge. This convoy, in accordance with the agreement between the two sides, departed from Pyongyang at 6:00 AM, with the stipulated red cloth markings on the vehicle roofs and red flag markings on the front of the vehicles. However, U.S. jet aircraft discovered the convoy and, after circling several times, openly strafed the convoy continuously and fired rocket launchers, and then dropped bombs, hitting the first truck in the convoy, injuring two members of the Korean-Chinese delegation on board. Prior to this, on January 3rd, U.S. aircraft also attacked vehicles of the Korean-Chinese delegation traveling from Pyongyang to Kaesong on the road stipulated in the agreement between the two sides.
	Today, our liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, lodged a strong protest with the other side's liaison officer, Murray. While the reporter was writing the news of this provocative incident by the U.S. side, U.S. jet aircraft again released glaring white contrails in the blue sky above the Kaesong neutral zone. This provocative behavior by the other side has occurred four times in six days since the U.S. aircraft intruded into the airspace of Northeast China on the 13th. This series of provocative incidents proves that when the other side is unable to achieve its absurd demands for interfering in our internal affairs at the negotiation table, it resorts to despicable means of sabotaging the negotiations outside the meeting. Our General Xie Fang solemnly pointed out at today's negotiation meeting: The U.S. side has used every means, but the same means did not work last August, and it will definitely not work now.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th. Our correspondent reports: Today, our military policeman, Ming Dongzhen, provided the other side's liaison officer, Levy, with all the facts about the U.S. aircraft bombing of the Kaesong neutral zone on the 17th at Panmunjom. On that day, Ming Dongzhen was on guard about 700 meters south of the impact site. At 9:35 AM, he saw two U.S. aircraft flying from the direction of Songaksan Mountain, circling once, and then flying west. Then he heard aircraft flying from the south, and soon he heard "hiss! hiss!" sounds, followed by the sound of bombs exploding. At this time, he looked at his watch and it was 9:40 AM. He then looked up at the sky and saw an aircraft from the gaps in the clouds, flying north in a flash. Although the weather was clear and sunny that day, there were some white clouds in the sky. The aircraft flew by quickly, so Ming Dongzhen could not see what type of aircraft it was, but he saw a propeller on the first batch of aircraft flying lower.
	At this point, the whole truth about the U.S. aircraft bombing of the Kaesong neutral zone on the 17th has been revealed to the world. But the other side's liaison officer, Levy, still says he wants to investigate their "own records". However, the facts have made it generally accepted that even if the perpetrators have the ability to "deceive the heavens and change the earth," it is difficult to escape responsibility for this daytime bombing incident.

    美机又违反协议公然轰炸我代表团车队
    我方联络官张春山上校向对方提出严重抗议
　　美机轰炸开城中立区的罪行又为我方军事警察证实
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社记者报道：就在我方抗议美机十七日轰炸开城中立区的第二天，对方空军又一次违反协议，竟然轰炸扫射我代表团车辆。十八日午后四时四十分，美机在汗浦桥附近攻击了朝中代表团自平壤驶往开城的以三辆汽车组成的车队。该车队遵照双方协议，早晨六时自平壤出发，车顶盖有规定的红布标志，车头有红旗标志。而美国喷气飞机发现该车队并在进行数次盘旋后，公然对该车队连续扫射并发射火箭炮，进而投下了炸弹，命中该车队中的第一辆卡车，车上两名朝中代表团人员受伤。在此以前，即一月三日，美机亦曾在双方协议规定的公路上攻击朝中代表团自平壤驶往开城的车辆。
    今日我方联络官张春山上校对对方联络官穆莱提出严重抗议。当记者正在写美方这一寻衅事件的消息时，美国喷气飞机又在开城中立区蔚蓝的天空中放出一条条刺目的白色喷气。对方这种挑衅行为自十三日美机侵犯中华人民共和国东北的领空以来，六天内已连续发生四次。这一系列的挑衅事件证明：当对方在谈判会议上无法实现其坚持干涉我方内政的荒谬要求时，就在会外采取破坏谈判的卑劣手段。我方解方将军在今日谈判会议上严正指出：美方什么手段都用过了，但同样的手段在去年八月没有行通，现在也是绝对行不通的。
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社记者报道：十九日我方军事警察明东振在板门店向对方联络官李维提供了十七日美机轰炸开城中立区的全部事实。那天，明东振是在离落弹地点以南约七百公尺处站岗。九时三十五分，他看见两架美国飞机从松岳山方向飞来，绕了一圈后即向西飞去。接着他又听到有飞机从南面飞来，一会儿，他就听到“嘶！嘶！”的声音，接着就是炸弹的爆炸声。这时，他看了一看表是九时四十分，他又仰首向天上看，从云隙中他看到一架飞机，一掠就向北飞去了。那天，天气虽然晴和，但天空有些白云，飞机很快地飞过去，所以，明东振看不出是什么类型的飞机，只看见飞得低些的第一批飞机上有一个螺旋桨。
    至此，十七日美机轰炸开城中立区前前后后的真情实况都已大白于天下了，而对方联络官李维还说什么要调查他们“自己的纪录”。但是，事实已使人们公认：即使行凶者有“偷天换日”的本领，也难逃避这次白天轰炸事件的责任。
