The Chinese People's Volunteers are a force that today shakes the world. They are the meritorious servants of the Chinese people, the closest friends of peace-loving people all over the world, and a formidable enemy that the imperialist aggressors hate and fear the most.

More than two years ago, Chairman Mao said: The Chinese people have stood up. At that time, the Chinese people themselves believed this, and the friends of the Chinese people also believed it. But the always arrogant imperialists, especially the American imperialists, were unwilling to believe it. It wasn't until the Chinese People's Volunteers drove the American imperialist aggressors from the Yalu River back to the vicinity of the "38th parallel," beating them until they abandoned their armor and helmets, their heads spinning, and they were unable to stand firm, that Truman, MacArthur, and other reckless warmongers woke up from their dreams and suddenly realized that the Chinese people had indeed stood up. This is not surprising, as imperialists only understand the language of force.

What shocked the world the most was that the glorious achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers were achieved with inferior equipment. At that time, we not only did not have airplanes, artillery, and tanks, but we also did not have reliable mechanized transportation. Under various inferior material conditions, we were still able to win great victories, causing the enemy to tremble in the front and panic in the rear. This naturally cannot but be attributed to the heroic spirit and noble qualities of each of our soldiers. Without a high degree of political awareness, this is unimaginable. Every time we think of the countless inspiring deeds, we are moved to tears and jump for joy. We don't know how to convey to each of our heroic soldiers our fervent feelings of respect and love.

Now the situation is of course very different. Now we not only have artillery and tanks, but we also have an air force that poses an "air threat" to the enemy. We can not only fight the mobile warfare that we have always been good at, but we can also fight modern positional warfare and "attrition warfare." Our transportation situation and air defense equipment are very different from the early days of the war. We are almost able to fight this war with the enemy on an equal footing in terms of military strength. If we were able to win great victories in the past under inferior conditions, what about the results under conditions of equal military strength? If the American imperialists insist on breaking off the armistice negotiations and insist on sending a large number of people to their deaths, that is naturally their freedom.

Last year, our way of supporting the front was to donate airplanes and artillery. This has already achieved better-than-expected results, and there is no need to donate more now. Our current way of supporting the front is to "increase production and practice strict economy." Coordinating with the "anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement" to massively increase production and practice strict economy, so that the great motherland can both resist aggression and engage in construction, is the best way for us to support the heroic soldiers at the front today, and it is also the best way for us to welcome the return delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

We read about the heroic deeds of Song Changfu, an anti-aircraft machine gunner of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Hu Lian, an anti-tank gunner, Mei Huaiqing, a member of the Communist Youth League, Li Bingqun, a Communist Party member, Zhong Xiuyan, a telephone operator, Tian Jing, a medical worker, and countless other soldiers who have won glory for the motherland, and we are inspired and proud. We can only continuously learn from and improve in all aspects, like Zhao Guilan, Ma Hengchang, Hao Jianxiu, Li Shunda, Qu Yaoli and other labor heroes, the methods of creating wealth and saving wealth for the country to thank and comfort our combat heroes.

In the past two days, the delegation of the Korean people visiting China has also arrived in Beijing. The Korean people bravely stood up to fight to the death with the ferocious American imperialists to defend their motherland, and they deserve the admiration of the people of the world. Their spirit of loving freedom, their courage and perseverance, are the model for all the people in Asia who love independence and freedom today. They have fully demonstrated to the oppressed nations of the world that as long as we have determination, courage, and organization, the oppression of the imperialists can certainly be overthrown, and the aggression of the imperialists can certainly be defeated. Here, I congratulate them on their countless victories so far, and I congratulate them on their final victory coming soon.

    以敬爱的心情欢迎你们
    北京市抗美援朝分会主席　张奚若
    中国人民志愿军是今日威震全世界的一种力量。它是中国人民的功臣，它是全世界爱好和平的人民的至友，它又是帝国主义侵略家最讨厌最害怕的一个劲敌。
    两年多以前，毛主席说：中国人民站起来了。那时候，中国人民自己相信这句话，中国人民的朋友也相信这句话，但是向来自高自大的帝国主义者，尤其是美帝国主义者，却不愿相信它。迨到中国人民志愿军把美帝国主义者的侵略军由鸭绿江赶回到“三八线”附近，打得他们弃甲丢盔，头晕目眩，站立不稳的时候，杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟和其他不知天高地厚的战争贩子们才如大梦初醒，忽然认识到中国人民果然是站起来了。这也难怪，帝国主义者本来只懂得武力的语言。
    最使全世界震惊的乃是中国人民志愿军这种辉煌的成就是在劣势装备下取得的。那时，我们不但没有飞机大炮和坦克，我们也没有可靠的机械化运输工具。在各种劣势的物质条件下，我们仍能大打胜仗，使敌人前方胆寒，后方震恐。这自然不能不归功于我们每个战士的英雄气概和高贵品质。没有高度的政治觉悟，这是不能想像的。我们每一想到那无数的可歌可泣的事迹，我们就喜欢得流泪，高兴得雀跃。我们不知如何才能把我们敬爱每一个英勇战士的热烈心情传达给他们。
    现在情势当然大大不同了。现在我们不但有大炮和坦克，我们还有对敌人构成“空中威胁”的空军。我们不但会打向来擅长的运动战，我们也会打现代的阵地战和“杀伤战”。我们的运输情况和防空设备都与参战初期大不相同了。我们差不多快和敌人能在军力相等的基础上打这个战争了。以前在劣势情况下尚能大打胜仗，以后在军力相等的条件下成绩还要问吗？假如美帝国主义者一定要使停战谈判破裂，一定要大量送死，那自然是他们的自由。
    我们去年支援前线的办法是捐献飞机大炮。这已有超过预期的成绩，现在不需要再捐献了。我们现时支援前线的方法是“增加生产，厉行节约”。配合着“反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动”，去大规模地增加生产，厉行节约，使伟大的祖国既可抵抗侵略，又可从事建设，就是我们今天支援前线英勇战士最好的方法，也是我们欢迎中国人民志愿军归国代表团最好的形式。
    我们读了中国人民志愿军高射机枪手宋长福、反坦克手胡连、青年团员梅怀清、共产党员李炳群、电话员钟秀彦、医务工作者田静及其他许许多多说不完数不清的战士们为祖国争光的英雄事迹，我们振奋，我们骄傲。我们只有在各方面不断地效法和提高像赵桂兰、马恒昌、郝建秀、李顺达、曲耀离等劳动英雄们为国家创造财富节约财富的方法去答谢去慰劳我们的战斗英雄。
    这两天朝鲜人民访华代表团也到了北京。朝鲜人民为保卫他们的祖国，勇敢地起来与穷凶极恶的美帝国主义者作殊死斗争，是值得全世界人民敬仰的。他们爱自由的精神，他们的勇气和毅力，是今日整个亚洲爱独立爱自由的人民的模范。他们向全世界被压迫的民族充分证明：只要我们有决心，有勇气，有组织，帝国主义者的压迫是一定能够推翻的，帝国主义者的侵略是一定能够打败的。我在这里祝贺他们迄今为止的无数胜利，我并祝贺他们的最后胜利不久到来。
