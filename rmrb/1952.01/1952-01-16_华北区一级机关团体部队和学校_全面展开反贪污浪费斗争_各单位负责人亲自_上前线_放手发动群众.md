(Dispatch from this newspaper) The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the organizations directly under the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, all first-level people's organizations, troops, and schools in North China has been fully launched since the new year. Units that mobilized later, such as the North China Military Region and the North China Cooperative General Agency, have also fully launched the confession and exposure movement.

Experience in this stage proves that the most important reason for the movement to achieve results in a short period of time is that the heads of each unit personally "go to the front lines." The content of personally "going to the front lines" not only requires the responsible persons to take the lead in making self-criticisms, explaining policies, and launching democratic self-assessments; it is also necessary to implement the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses. An important link in mobilizing the masses is to "have a clear understanding in your mind," which means to target and struggle against those elements who hinder the movement and suppress democracy. The facts in the North China Military Region prove that these elements are often the so-called "tigers." As long as the "tigers" are resolutely struck down, the masses can be mobilized. The North China Military Region's approach is: each department organizes a frugality inspection office, which, under the direct leadership of the leaders, promptly understands the progress of the movement in its subordinate units. In addition to generally assisting lower-level departments in promoting the movement, it mainly looks at which unit has major problems in the movement. The direct superior leader immediately goes to assist and supervise the resolution. For example, Ge Xiufeng, regimental commander of a certain regiment of the Military Region Headquarters, and Zhang Fangming, section chief of a certain section of the Military Region Cadre Management Department, dared to resist the movement and refused to confess. The leadership immediately announced their removal from office for investigation. This supported righteousness and boosted the morale of the masses. For another example, Qi Zhenbo, deputy section chief of the Film Section of the Culture Department of the Political Department of the Military Region and manager of the Dahua Cinema, suppressed democracy and threatened Yang Tai and others not to expose him. After learning about the situation, Ding Li, Minister of the Culture Department of the Political Department of the Military Region, immediately went to the Dahua Cinema with cadres from the Political Department's Frugality Inspection Office. On the one hand, he resolutely supported the masses and launched exposures; on the other hand, he checked the accounts and conducted investigations, finally exposing Qi Zhenbo's crime of embezzling more than 90 million yuan. The New Life Coal Station under the Political Department boldly mobilized the masses, and the staff and workers spontaneously rose up to expose the embezzlement facts of Zhao Zhendong and Yuan Bin, the station's manager and deputy manager. After mobilization, the staff and workers of the August 1st Film Projector Factory also spontaneously exposed the factory director's and deputy factory director's embezzlement and waste.

Another experience in the movement proves that holding mass anti-corruption struggle and confession and exposure meetings at the appropriate time on the basis of a certain level of awareness among the masses is a powerful measure to promote the widespread and in-depth development of the movement. The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggles in the organizations of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the North China Military Region, the North China People's Revolutionary University, the North China Cooperative General Agency, etc., have all achieved excellent results in holding such mass meetings. In such mass meetings, because the corrupt elements confessed and repented, and the meeting was criticized in a guided manner, and the leadership announced on the spot the decisions to reduce or exempt punishment and the necessary handling decisions based on the corrupt elements' mistakes and degree of repentance, the policies were vividly and concretely implemented, and the confession movement was promoted. For example, after the organizations under the General Office of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held such a meeting, twenty-five people turned around that day and spontaneously confessed the facts of embezzlement and waste that they had originally wanted to conceal; there were also thirty-five cases of active exposure and whistleblowing. Such a meeting also educated those who held complacent attitudes towards the movement. Some leaders further realized that the past practice of stopping the movement in group meetings and individual talks was actually committing the fault of being timid and afraid to boldly mobilize the masses.

To mobilize the masses to boldly expose and report, it is also necessary to combine it with conducting multi-faceted investigation and research. Because only in this way can corruption be thoroughly and cleanly eradicated and the movement be more in-depth. Facts prove that almost every major corrupt element is forced to confess and is exposed in this "internal and external attack" situation. In addition to organizing inspection teams to check internal accounts, the North China Cooperative General Agency also conducted in-depth visits and investigations of relevant private factories and shops. This mass investigation is a powerful measure to directly force corrupt elements to confess. Qin Zhongkang, deputy section chief of the Finance Section of the North China Cooperative General Agency, and Dong Linge, a salesman in the Sales Section, were forced to confess the facts of embezzlement that they thought others could not figure out under these circumstances. Cai Jiarong, director of the New Life Iron and Wood Factory under the Political Department of the North China Military Region, bought broken machines worth 27 million yuan and falsely reported 110 million yuan. At the beginning of the movement, he refused to admit that he had any embezzlement behavior. After the factory workers investigated, in addition to finding out the conclusive evidence of his embezzlement, they also found out the stolen goods he embezzled, such as five taels of gold, nine gold rings, four watches, and a pair of gold bracelets. After his embezzlement was confirmed, Cai Jiarong could only surrender.

The facts of corruption that have been revealed in the current movement fully expose the fact that the bourgeoisie is constantly launching a frantic attack on the revolutionary ranks. Their methods are extremely despicable and pervasive. The major corrupt elements listed above were first seduced and lured by private merchants, and then colluded with private merchants and worked together to cheat. For example, when Li Yanrong, deputy director of the August 1st Film Projector Factory, went to Shanghai to buy machines, the manager of a private motor factory in Shanghai shamelessly "sacrificed" his "wife," accompanying Li Yanrong to eat, watch movies, and have fun, and then asked Li Yanrong for about 120 million yuan more in the price of a domestically produced grinding machine. Su Guanglin, manager of the private Jianye Model Industrial Cooperative in Beijing, colluded with Cai Jiarong, director of the publicly owned New Life Iron and Wood Factory, to sell unusable broken machines at a price inflated by 80 million yuan, three times the market price of the machines. However, the personnel of each unit now fully realize that these profiteers are the moths who collude with corrupt elements to steal national assets. They have experienced the great political significance of Chairman Mao's call to vigorously and vigorously carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle, and are unanimously determined to carry the movement through to the end, promote the mass exposure and reporting movement in all aspects, and resolutely repel any open or secret attacks by the bourgeoisie.

    华北区一级机关团体部队和学校
    全面展开反贪污浪费斗争
    各单位负责人亲自“上前线”放手发动群众
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局直属机关、华北一级各人民团体、部队、学校的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，新年以来全面展开。动员较迟的华北军区、华北合作总社等单位，都已全面地开展了坦白、检举运动。
    这一阶段的经验证明，各单位负责人亲自“上前线”是运动能在短时间内取得成效的最主要原因。亲自“上前线”的内容，不仅要负责人带头检讨，交代政策和发动民主检查；还要贯彻放手发动群众的政策。发动群众的重要环节是“心中有数”，就是要对准阻碍运动、压制民主的分子进行斗争。华北军区的事实证明，这些分子往往是人们所说的“老虎”，只要坚决打击“老虎”就能发动群众。华北军区的做法是：各部组织节约检查办公室，在首长直接领导下及时了解所属各单位的运动进展情况，除了一般地协助下级部门推进运动外，主要看那个单位在运动中有重大问题，直属上级首长就立即去协助督导解决。例如军区司令部某团团长葛秀峰、军区干部管理部某处处长张方明，胆敢抵抗运动拒不坦白，领导上立即宣布将他们撤职查办。这样就扶持了正气，振奋了群众的斗志。又如军区政治部的文化部电影科副科长兼大华电影院经理齐振波，压制民主，威胁杨泰等不准对他进行检举。军区政治部文化部部长丁里在了解情况后，当即亲自协同政治部节约检查办公室干部到大华电影院，一面坚决给群众撑腰，发动检举，一面检查账目并进行调查，终于揭发了齐振波贪污九千多万元的罪行。政治部所属新生煤站放手发动群众，职工们就自动起来揭发了该站正、副经理赵振东、袁斌的贪污事实。八一电影机制造厂职工们经过动员后，也自动揭发了厂长、副厂长的贪污浪费行为。
    运动中的另一经验证明，在群众一定的觉悟基础上，适时举行群众反贪污斗争和坦白、检举大会，是推动运动普遍深入展开的有力措施。中共中央华北局、华北军区、华北人民革命大学、华北合作总社等单位的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争，在举行这样的群众大会中，都收到了极好的效果。这种群众大会，由于贪污分子坦白悔过，并有领导地进行大会批评，而且当场领导上又根据贪污分子的错误及悔过程度，分别宣布减免处分和必要的处理决定，就生动具体地贯彻了政策，推动了坦白运动。例如中共中央华北局办公厅所属各单位在召开这样的大会后，当天就有二十五人回过头来，自动坦白了原想隐瞒的贪污、浪费事实；积极揭发检举的也有三十五起。这样的大会，还教育了那些对运动抱有自满情绪的人。有些领导人进一步认识到过去把运动停留在小组会和个别谈话上的作法，实际上是犯了小手小脚，不敢大胆放手发动群众的毛病。
    发动群众大胆检举、揭发，还必须结合进行多方面的调查研究。因为只有这样，才能彻底、干净地肃清贪污，使运动更加深入。事实证明，几乎每个大贪污分子，都是在这样“内外夹攻”的情况下，被迫坦白和被检举出来的。华北合作总社，除组织检查组查对内部账目外，并深入有关私营厂、店进行访问调查。这种群众性的调查，是直接迫使贪污分子坦白的有力措施。华北合作总社财务科副科长秦仲康、推销科员董麟阁，就在这种情况下，被迫坦白了他们曾认为别人无法弄清的贪污事实。华北军区政治部所属新生铁木厂厂长蔡家荣，买了价值两千七百万元的破机器，假报一亿一千万元，运动开始时，他死也不肯承认有贪污行为；经过厂内职工调查的结果，除查明他贪污的确证外，并查出他贪污来的五两黄金、九个金戒指、四块手表、一付金镯等赃物。蔡家荣在自己的贪污罪行被证实后，就只能俯首就逮。
    目前运动中已揭发的贪污事实，充分暴露了资产阶级不断向革命队伍疯狂进攻的事实。他们的方法是极端卑鄙的，也是无孔不入的。以上所列举的大贪污分子，都是首先由私商勾引、利诱，然后和私商狼狈为奸，共同作弊。例如八一电影机制造厂副厂长李彦荣到上海买机器时，上海私营电机厂经理竟无耻地赔上了自己的“夫人”，陪着李彦荣吃饭、看戏、悠游玩乐，然后在卖出的一部土造磨机的价钱中，向李彦荣多要了约一亿二千万元。北京私营建业模型工业社经理苏光林，勾结公营新生铁木厂厂长蔡家荣，以不能使用的破机器，并抬高价格八千万元，相当机器市价三倍的价钱卖出。但是各单位人员现已充分认识到这些奸商就是伙同贪污分子盗窃国家资财的蟊贼。他们体验到毛主席号召大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的伟大政治意义，一致决心把运动贯彻到底，从各方面推动群众性的揭发检举运动，坚决打退资产阶级的任何公开的或秘密的进攻。
