Xinhua News Agency, January 10th—The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has rapidly unfolded due to the leaders taking personal action and mobilizing the masses, eliminating their concerns.

The Ministry of Railways began the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign on December 8th of last year. However, at that time, because the leaders did not take personal action, leading cadres in the affiliated units did not have sufficient understanding of the political significance of this campaign. As a result, by the end of the year, the masses in most units had not been mobilized. Some workers and lower-level cadres in some units were initially very enthusiastic about this campaign, believing that "Chairman Mao's call can solve major problems." But later, seeing that the leaders did not actively participate, they were afraid that "the leadership is not determined," and that reporting others would be like "failing to catch the snake but being bitten instead." Some employees were also concerned that only those below would be moved, while those above would not, resulting in "big fish escaping the net while small fish suffer." Therefore, they did not actively participate in this campaign.

In order to change the above situation, the Ministry of Railways' Production Increase and Economy Committee was reorganized on January 3rd of this year, with Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan personally leading the campaign. On the 4th, at a mobilization meeting attended by more than two thousand employees, Minister Teng conveyed the Central Committee's instructions on launching the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, and earnestly reviewed his own mistakes of violating national financial discipline, undermining systems, and engaging in certain extravagant and wasteful practices in his personal life. This self-criticism deeply moved the employees present. Those who previously suspected that "the leaders' report was only meant to move those below" immediately dispelled their concerns and actively participated in the campaign, with some even becoming active in boldly exposing others. The Machinery Bureau, which previously believed that its unit was "clean as a whistle," confessed on the afternoon of that day to five instances of corruption, five instances of embezzlement of public funds, and two instances of claiming excessive travel expenses. After this mobilization meeting, the Production Increase and Economy Committee of the Ministry of Railways also punished some corrupt elements who resisted the campaign, and the campaign has been developing even more rapidly.

    滕代远部长亲自带头检讨消除群众顾虑
    铁道部反贪污浪费运动迅速展开
    【新华社十日讯】中央人民政府铁道部的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，由于首长亲自动手，发动群众，消除了群众的顾虑，现已迅速展开。
    铁道部自去年十二月八日起就开始开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，但当时因为首长没有亲自动手，所属各单位的领导干部对这一运动的政治意义认识不足，以致到年底时，多数单位的群众仍未发动起来。有些单位的工人群众和下层干部，在这运动一开始时本来情绪很高，认为“毛主席这一号召能解决大问题”，但后来一看首长没有积极参加，就又害怕“领导上决心不大”，检举别人时会“打蛇不着受蛇咬”。也有的职工顾虑是不是只叫下面动，上面不动，结果“大鱼漏网，小鱼遭殃”，因而也就不积极参加这一运动。
    为了改变上面所说的情况，铁道部机关增产节约委员会在今年一月三日实行改组，铁道部部长滕代远亲自领导这一运动。四日滕部长在全部两千多职工的动员大会上，传达了中央关于开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的指示，恳挚地检讨了自己违反国家财政纪律、破坏制度、生活上某些铺张浪费的错误。这一检讨使到会职工深受感动。过去怀疑“首长报告仅是要下面动”的人当即解除顾虑，积极参加到运动中来，有的并成为大胆揭发别人的积极分子。过去认为本单位“两袖清风”的机务局，当天下午就坦白出来了五件贪污、五件挪用公款、两件多领出差费的事实。这次动员大会后，铁道部机关增产节约委员会又对抵抗运动的一些贪污分子作了处分，运动就更迅速地开展起来。
