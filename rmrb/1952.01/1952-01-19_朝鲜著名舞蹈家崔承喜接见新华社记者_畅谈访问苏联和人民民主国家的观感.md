Korean famous dancer Choi Seung-hee, who recently returned to Beijing, recently received a reporter from this agency and spoke freely about her impressions of participating in the 3rd World Youth and Students for Peace Festival and visiting Eastern European People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union.

She said: In the Youth Festival, the dances of the Soviet Union, China, and Korea all won awards. The Korean dance "Mother of Korea" (including the two dances "Mother" and "Female Guerrilla" which had been performed in China) won the "Peace Prize." This dance was created by her in China. She said that the reason why Korean dance can win awards is due to the correct guidance of the Korean people's leader Kim Il-sung on art. At the same time, this is inseparable from the Soviet army's liberation of Korea, which created the conditions for the development of Korean people's art; this time it was even more possible to perform in Berlin because of the love and help of the Chinese people.

After the end of the Youth Festival, Choi Seung-hee participated in the "Korean People's Art Troupe" and visited the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Soviet Union, conveying the firm will and determination of the Korean and Chinese people to heroically resist the American aggressors to the people of fraternal countries and expressing their gratitude for their assistance to the Korean people. She said excitedly: Whether in the Youth Festival or in visiting various fraternal countries, I personally experienced the solid unity and great strength of the peace and democracy camp, so my confidence in the victory of the just war waged by the Korean people has been further strengthened. We could see huge factories and buildings everywhere in Poland. Poland suffered great damage in World War II, but the Polish people, with the help of the Soviet Union, worked hard to resume construction, and now Warsaw has been restored to eighty percent. Therefore, we firmly believe that although the cities and villages of Korea have been greatly damaged, with the help of the Soviet people, the Chinese people, and the people of all fraternal countries, we will definitely achieve victory and quickly rebuild a happy life.

When the "Korean People's Art Troupe" visited the Soviet Union, they happened to catch up with the October Revolution Festival, and they were invited to participate in the celebration and military parade in Moscow. Choi Seung-hee said: In the military parade, we personally saw the strength of the great peace fortress of the Soviet Union. The marching Soviet people shouted "Long live Stalin," "Long live Mao Zedong," and "Long live Kim Il-sung," and enthusiastically presented wreaths to the delegations of Korea and China. They said: The people of Korea and China will surely be victorious. All this gave us great encouragement.

Last December, the "Korean People's Art Troupe" returned to Korea after visiting the Soviet Union. They performed ten times in Korea to comfort the Korean military and civilians and the Chinese People's Volunteers who were fighting hard. When talking about the close friendship between the Korean and Chinese people, Choi Seung-hee said: In Korea, you can see scenes of the Volunteers and the Korean people being as close as a family everywhere. The Volunteers not only fought side by side with the People's Army at the front, but also helped the Korean people with farming, transporting supplies, and standing guard on the roadside in the rear, which made me even more fond of the Volunteers.

On December 11, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea awarded medals and prizes to a group of artists, including Choi Seung-hee, who had contributed to the development of national art. Choi Seung-hee, who had previously received the Second-Class National Flag Medal, was awarded the Labor Medal again. When talking about this, Choi Seung-hee said: This honor should belong to the heroic Korean people and the Chinese people. We can only repay them by serving the people better.

Choi Seung-hee said: This visit to various fraternal countries has given us a great education. Seeing the brilliant achievements of their national art in the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries has made us more deeply realize that only under the socialist and people's democratic system, and only under the correct guidance of the people's leaders, can art develop to such a high level. We should learn from the Soviet Union well. She said: After returning to China, she saw that the Chinese literary and art circles were launching a movement to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought combined with Chinese revolutionary practice. Through such a movement, more brilliant achievements in the future of Chinese people's literature and art can be expected. In my future work, I will also follow General Kim Il-sung's instructions on literary and art issues, study Mao Zedong Thought, and use art as a weapon to better serve the Korean and Chinese people.

She finally said that she is preparing to create a dance drama with the theme of the Korean and Chinese people fighting side by side against Japan and the United States to eulogize the fighting friendship forged with blood by the Korean and Chinese people.

    朝鲜著名舞蹈家崔承喜接见新华社记者
    畅谈访问苏联和人民民主国家的观感
    【新华社十八日讯】最近返抵北京的朝鲜著名舞蹈家崔承喜顷接见本社记者，畅谈她参加第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节、访问东欧人民民主国家和苏联的观感。
    她说：在青年联欢节中，苏联、中国、朝鲜的舞蹈都得了奖。朝鲜的舞蹈“朝鲜的母亲”（包括在中国演出过的“母亲”和“女游击队员”两个舞蹈）得到了“和平奖”，这个舞蹈是她在中国创作的。她说：朝鲜舞蹈之所以能够得奖，是因为朝鲜人民领袖金日成对艺术的正确指导。同时，这是和苏军解放朝鲜，创造了朝鲜人民艺术发展的条件分不开的；这次更是因为得到中国人民的爱护和帮助，才有可能在柏林演出。
    在青年联欢节结束后，崔承喜参加了“朝鲜人民艺术团”，先后访问了德意志民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和苏联，把朝、中人民英勇抗击美国侵略者的坚强意志和决心传达给兄弟国家的人民，并对他们给朝鲜人民的援助表示感谢。她兴奋地说：无论在青年联欢节和访问各兄弟国家中，我都亲身体验到和平民主阵营的巩固团结和伟大力量，因此，对于朝鲜人民进行的正义战争的胜利信心更为加强了。我们在波兰到处可以看到巨大的工厂和建筑物。波兰在第二次世界大战中曾受到很大的破坏，但是波兰人民在苏联的帮助下，努力从事恢复建设工作，现在，华沙已恢复了百分之八十。因此，我们深信：朝鲜的城市和乡村虽然受到很大的破坏，在苏联人民、中国人民和各兄弟国家人民的帮助下，我们是一定能取得胜利并迅速重新建设起幸福的生活的。
    “朝鲜人民艺术团”在访问苏联时，正赶上十月革命节，他们被邀参加了莫斯科的庆祝会和阅兵礼。崔承喜说：在阅兵礼中，我们亲眼看到了伟大的和平堡垒苏联的强大，游行的苏联人民高呼“斯大林万岁”、“毛泽东万岁”、“金日成万岁”，而且热情地把花环送给朝鲜和中国的代表团，他们说：朝鲜和中国的人民是一定会得到胜利的。这一切，都使我们得到了莫大的鼓舞。
    去年十二月，“朝鲜人民艺术团”在访问苏联后回到了朝鲜。他们在朝鲜演出了十次，慰问艰苦抗战的朝鲜军民和中国人民志愿军。崔承喜在谈到朝、中人民的亲密友谊时说：在朝鲜，到处可以看到志愿军和朝鲜人民亲如一家人的情景。志愿军不但在前线和人民军并肩作战，而且在后方帮助朝鲜人民耕作，输送物资，在路旁站岗，这些都使我更增加了对志愿军的爱戴。
    十二月十一日，朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会以勋章和奖章授予崔承喜等一批对发展民族艺术有贡献的艺术家。曾经得到过二级国旗勋章的崔承喜又荣获劳动勋章，在谈到这件事的时候，崔承喜说：这种荣誉应该属于英勇的朝鲜人民和中国人民，我们只有以更好地为人民服务来报答。
    崔承喜说：这次访问各兄弟国家，使我们得到很大的教育。在苏联和各人民民主国家看到它们的民族艺术的辉煌成就，使我们更深刻地体会到只有在社会主义和人民民主的制度下，只有在人民领袖的正确指导下，艺术才能发展到这样的高度。我们应该很好地向苏联学习。她说：回到中国后：看到中国文艺界正在展开学习马克思、列宁主义和中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想的运动，通过这样的运动，中国人民文艺未来更加辉煌的成就是可以预期的。我在今后的工作中，也要遵照金日成将军关于文艺问题的指示，学习毛泽东思想，以艺术为武器，更好地为朝中人民服务。
    她最后说，她正准备创作一个以朝中人民并肩抗日、抗美为题材的舞剧，歌颂朝中人民以鲜血结成的战斗友谊。
