    Our Great Motherland
    In the New Year of 1952, the volunteer soldiers in the trenches received New Year's greetings from Commander Peng Dehuai. Every soldier deeply felt from his own experience that our army was becoming stronger and stronger in battle, and they expressed their determination to strive for even greater victories in 1952 to thank the higher-level leaders for their care. This is the scene of the volunteer soldiers of a certain unit taking an oath while writing letters of determination to their superiors.
