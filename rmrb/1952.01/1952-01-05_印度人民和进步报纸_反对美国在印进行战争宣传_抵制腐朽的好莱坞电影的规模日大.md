Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 28th: "Pravda" published a dispatch from Delhi by Bochenko, describing the current propaganda activities of the United States in India and how the progressive people of India are fighting against this propaganda.

Bochenko said that major cinemas in India screen American films year after year. These films are filled with poisons such as war propaganda, misanthropic ideas, and insane delusions of world domination. What these films fail to accomplish is supplemented by American books and newspapers. Books, like waste paper, can be said to flood India.

Movies and pernicious foreign imported books have a similarly harmful effect: they poison young people, teaching them to lie, steal, rob, murder, and betray their country and people.

The "Indian News Chronicle" in its September issue calculated that foreign books and newspapers worth approximately seven million rupees were imported in 1951.

Professors at Calcutta University and Aligarh University said that Americans and Britons freely gave university libraries hundreds of books that were popular in the United States.

To entice Indian students, Americans set up free tea rooms in university reading rooms. American propagandists are increasingly making malicious and slanderous speeches, casually insulting all progressive things. US Ambassador to India Bowles recently attempted to give a speech to students at Calcutta University, but was booed off the stage.

Americans publish news bulletins in local languages in India, containing articles slandering the Soviet Union, People's China, and the People's Democratic countries. Americans force their bulletins on clubs, organizations, and individuals, using this method to influence Indian public opinion and instill the "American way."

Bochenko said: Many intellectuals in Bombay complained to me that they are embarrassed by the twelve-page weekly "American Reporter," which is published in the main languages of India. Americans consider this a "hot weapon" in their Cold War. The paper glorifies aggressive American foreign policy and the fascist terror in America. The newspaper wants to buy off local writers and use Indian hands to plan blatant propaganda about racism, atomic war, and war hysteria.

Bochenko continued, the American propagandists are willing to use money to gain control of Indian newspapers. They simply bought many Indian newspapers and magazines published in various languages, including the "Atomic Weekly."

Indian journalists still feel indignant when they recall the meeting of reactionary newspaper editors convened by former US Ambassador to India Henderson in early 1951. At the meeting, the ambassador, in a masterly manner, "explained" Truman's foreign policy, raised some questions, and indicated the general direction, demanding that the editors adhere to the line of defending American aggression in Korea.

Bochenko pointed out that the conspiracies of American imperialism and its lackeys have greatly angered progressive people in India. The Indian people spurn those who advocate the "American way of life" and attempt to transplant decadent "culture" to India. The best representatives of Indian intellectuals are increasingly and persistently raising issues of great significance to India, its people, and its culture in their works. They are increasingly boldly facing life and talking about social issues. Ghosh's film "The Dispossessed" vividly proves this point. The scale of the boycott of rotten Hollywood movies is growing. Indian progressive newspapers are strongly exposing American reactionary propaganda.

Bochenko concluded that all of this demonstrates the Indian people's desire for freedom and democracy, and shows that the people's hatred for imperialist robbers is growing deeper and deeper.

    印度人民和进步报纸
    反对美国在印进行战争宣传
    抵制腐朽的好莱坞电影的规模日大
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十二月二十八日讯：“真理报”刊载波诚科的德里通讯，描写目前美国在印度进行宣传和印度进步人民如何与这种宣传进行斗争的情形。
    波诚科说，印度各大电影院成年累月地放映美国电影。这些影片充满着战争宣传、憎恶人类的思想和称霸世界的疯狂妄想等毒素；这些电影所没有做到的，就由美国的书报补做起来。像废纸一样的书籍可以说是充斥了印度。
    电影与外国进口的恶劣书籍同样起着害人的作用：它们毒害青年，教他们撒谎、偷盗、抢劫、谋杀、出卖他们的祖国和人民。
    “印度新闻纪事报”九月份某期就曾计算过，一九五一年有约值七百万卢比的外国书报进口。
    加尔各答大学与阿里加大学的教授们说，美国人和英国人免费送给大学图书馆好几百册在美国风行一时的书籍。
    为了引诱印度学生，美国人在大学阅览室里设立了免费饮茶室。美国的宣传人员越来越经常地发表恶意中伤的演说，信口侮辱一切进步事物。美国驻印大使鲍尔士最近曾企图向加尔各答大学的学生发表演说，但在讲台上被人嗤下来了。
    美国人以本地文字在印度发表新闻公报，上面都是些诽谤苏联、人民中国和人民民主国家的文章。美国人硬把他们的公报送给俱乐部、机关和个人，用这种方式来影响印度的舆论，灌输“美国方式”。
    波诚科说：许多孟买的知识分子向我诉苦，说他们正因多达十二页的周报“美国报道”而困窘，这个周报是用印度的主要语文发行的，美国人认为这是他们冷战中的热武器。该报是歌颂侵略性的美国外交政策和美国法西斯恐怖统治的。这个报纸想收买当地的作家，用印度人的手来筹划关于种族主义、原子战争、战争歇斯底里的放肆宣传。
    波诚科继续说，美国的宣传人员不惜以金钱来取得对印度报纸的控制权。他们就干脆收买了以各种语文发行的许多印度报纸和杂志，其中有“原子周刊”。
    印度的新闻记者至今一想起前美国驻印大使韩德逊一九五一年初召集的反动报纸编辑会议，就义愤填膺。这个大使在会议上曾以主子姿态“解释”杜鲁门的外交政策，提出一些问题，指示了总的方针，他要求编辑们奉行为美国侵略朝鲜辩解的方针。
    波诚科指出，美帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋使印度的进步人士大为愤怒。印度人民唾弃那些鼓吹“美国生活方式”的人企图移植到印度的堕落的“文化”。印度知识分子最优秀的代表在他们的作品中越来越坚持不渝地提出对印度、对它的人民、对它的文化有极其重大意义的问题。他们越来越大胆地面向生活，谈论社会问题了。戈施导演的电影“被剥夺权利者”就很生动地证明了这一点。抵制腐臭的好莱坞电影的规模日益扩大。印度进步报纸坚强地揭穿美国的反动宣传。
    波诚科结语说，所有这些都表现了印度人民要求自由与民主的愿望，表现出人民群众对于帝国主义强盗的憎恨越来越深。
