    Most Members of the CPC Suichuan County Committee Degenerate and Metamorphose
    Jiangxi Provincial Committee Imposes Severe Penalties and Conducts Self-Criticism

    After the national revolutionary victory, members of the Chinese Communist Party's Suichuan County Committee in Jiangxi Province, due to the erosion of bourgeois ideology, degenerated and metamorphosed, causing incalculable losses to the Party's work, state property, and the political prestige of the Party and the People's Government among the masses. In order to strictly enforce Party discipline and purify the organization, the Chinese Communist Party Jiangxi Provincial Committee decided to punish the Suichuan County Party organization by revoking its leading organs; expel焦尔恭 (Jiao Ergong), the County Party Secretary, from the Party; place 孙元法 (Sun Yuanfa), a member of the County Committee (and County Magistrate of Suichuan), on probation within the Party for one year, and recommend that the government remove him from his post as County Magistrate; expel 鲁斌 (Lu Bin), the County Public Security Bureau Chief, from the Party, and recommend that the government remove him from his post and bring him to justice; give 韩峰 (Han Feng), the County Propaganda Minister, a public warning; the CPC Ji'an Prefectural Committee adopted a liberal attitude towards the Suichuan County Committee's problems and was given a reprimand. Other serious offenders were also dealt with separately, such as 王志荣 (Wang Zhirong), the District Party Secretary, who has been expelled from the Party and recommended to the judicial organs for execution according to law. The Chinese Communist Party Jiangxi Provincial Committee also conducted self-criticism for its untimely handling of this issue.

    The degeneration and metamorphosis of the Suichuan County Committee and its members were by no means accidental. Soon after entering the city, their lives gradually became corrupt, and evil influences gradually rose. The four members of the County Committee suspected each other and engaged in infighting. As a result, a few impure elements and ideologically unsound individuals became even more unbridled, and other cadres followed suit. Upright cadres became isolated and were subjected to sarcasm and blows, creating a serious atmosphere of corruption and degeneration among the majority of Party members and cadres throughout the county. The people of Suichuan cursed these bad cadres as "worse than the Kuomintang." According to existing statistics, the losses to state property and people's property due to corruption, extravagance, waste, and other illegal and undisciplined behaviors amounted to more than one billion yuan.

    The leading comrades of the CPC Ji'an Prefectural Committee were aware of this serious phenomenon as early as March of the year before last and had sent people to inspect it three times, but due to their bureaucratic style and liberal attitude, they failed to discover and solve the problem in a timely manner. It was not until February last year, when 李立 (Li Li), the Prefectural Committee Secretary, and 朱继先 (Zhu Jixian), the Deputy Secretary, personally led the rectification in Suichuan that the problem was thoroughly exposed.

    The main errors of the CPC Suichuan County Committee are:

    (1) Violating policies and laws, extorting and levying taxes arbitrarily, establishing its own tax categories, and collecting various brokerage fees without authorization. According to statistics from nine districts, they used these illegal methods to defraud more than 18.16 million yuan. 陆地 (Lu Di), the former District Party Secretary of Duiqian District, defrauded the masses of more than 8.81 million yuan in the name of opening a clinic, and used the money for speculation and profiteering before using the earned money to open the clinic. 王志荣 (Wang Zhirong), the subsequent District Party Secretary of Duiqian District, smoked opium. Because he couldn't buy opium at a pastry shop, he closed the pastry shop overnight. He used the excuse of banning opium to detain more than 20 people in an attempt to extort them. When he ran out of money, he apportioned it to the villages, even demanding 100,000 yuan from each township for travel expenses when he went to the county to attend the rectification meeting, extorting a total of 1.94 million yuan.

    (2) Violating financial and economic discipline and undermining the financial and economic system. From the liberation of Suichuan to February last year, the county's financial and economic affairs were never unified. In particular, the phenomenon of using public funds and spending money indiscriminately, and the phenomenon of not distinguishing between the accounts of organ production and the accounts of expenses, was widespread. County Magistrate 孙元法 (Sun Yuanfa) used a total of 20 million yuan of tax revenue without authorization for organ production. Fines and confiscated materials were not turned over to the state treasury, but were mostly used for organ production, and some were embezzled and wasted by cadres. The Prefectural Committee instructed that the timber trade was not allowed, but the County Committee sold timber on a large scale, selling a total of 1,832 *liang* of timber, earning 400 million yuan (there are still 2,400 *liang* of timber in stock). Most of the profits from this organ production were embezzled and wasted by cadres. In addition, the abuse of personnel and the random use of horses also caused great waste.

    (3) Serious lack of organization and discipline and bureaucratic style. Some major issues were decided without authorization, without being discussed by the County Committee or formally requesting approval from higher authorities. For example, in the spring of 1950, 焦尔恭 (Jiao Ergong) rashly decided to build 298.35 *huali* of highways throughout the county, costing more than 265,900 man-days, occupying more than 200 *mu* of farmland, felling more than 19,700 trees (including more than 280 tea oil trees), demolishing 24 houses, leveling 11 civilian graves, and leveling a fish pond, costing more than 1 million *jin* of rice. As a result, the roads could not be opened to traffic, and the trees, houses, fish ponds, etc., were not compensated to the masses. For example, the Director of the County Grain Bureau used the pretext of repairing warehouses to build a two-story office building with a huge amount of money equal to one-third of the entire construction cost (equivalent to more than 100 million yuan in RMB), resulting in a reduction of 1.8 million *jin* of rice in the warehouse capacity. When the Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office investigated the matter, County Party Secretary 焦尔恭 (Jiao Ergong) and County Magistrate 孙元法 (Sun Yuanfa) replied that they were unaware of it. The County Party Secretary and the County Magistrate rarely went to the countryside, and many people scolded them as "bureaucrats." Some District Party Secretaries and District Heads also sat in the districts issuing orders. Some District Party Secretaries took advantage of the weakness of the County Committee leaders not going deep into the grassroots, made false reports at all levels, deceived and concealed, and acted independently. For example, District Party Secretary 王志荣 (Wang Zhirong) heard that financial and economic unification was about to be implemented, so he hurriedly made false accounts to deceive the leading organs.

    (4) Loss of class stand. For example, when 鲁斌 (Lu Bin), the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, went to the home of 刘匪春林 (Liu Fei Chunlin), the former secretary of the Kuomintang County Party Department, to learn about Liu Fei's situation, Liu Fei's wife and daughters hosted a banquet, and Liu Fei's daughter, 稚莉 (Zhi Li), personally accompanied him and wrote a poem to persuade him to drink. 鲁斌 (Lu Bin) stayed at Liu's house that night. Later, 鲁斌 (Lu Bin) introduced 刘稚莉 (Liu Zhili) to work as a primary school teacher in the county town, and the two had close contacts. Every time 刘稚莉 (Liu Zhili) went to the Public Security Bureau, 鲁斌 (Lu Bin) entertained her diligently, and the two often fooled around until late at night. The County People's Government and the County Committee learned several times about Liu Fei's whereabouts, but 鲁斌 (Lu Bin) sent Liu Fei's wife twice to "strive for" him, resulting in Liu Fei escaping even further. On the other hand, 鲁斌 (Lu Bin) treated the workers harshly in every way, delayed the workers' wages, and believed in slander without investigation or research, without listening to the workers' defenses, and without consulting the trade union, arbitrarily arresting and detaining workers.

    The Suichuan County Committee never seriously dealt with 鲁斌 (Lu Bin)'s acts of losing his class stand; on the contrary, it shielded him. For example, when the *Jiangxi Daily* exposed the Public Security Bureau's unreasonable detention of workers, the County Committee pushed 鲁斌 (Lu Bin)'s mistake onto 马金升 (Ma Jinsheng), a lower-level cadre, and punished Ma, but did not deal with 鲁斌 (Lu Bin).

    (5) Extremely serious extravagance, waste, corruption and degeneration. According to the inspection of the CPC Ji'an Prefectural Committee, the amount of public funds directly embezzled and wasted by cadres in Suichuan County was about 140 million yuan (other various objects were not included). From the county to the district, the waste on eating and drinking was very large. In addition to open eating and drinking, all expenses that could not be reimbursed were recorded under the "entertainment expenses" item. According to incomplete statistics, the total expenditure on food allowances and entertainment expenses throughout the county was 12.55 million yuan. Some bad cadres (from the Northeast region) even openly said: "What did we come here from the Northeast for? It doesn't matter if we eat and drink a little." 鲁斌 (Lu Bin), the Chief of the County Public Security Bureau, emphasized his special status and arbitrarily used more than 7.8 million yuan of organ production funds. The amount of personal embezzlement and waste by 王志荣 (Wang Zhirong), the District Party Secretary, reached more than 8 million yuan. 王志荣 (Wang Zhirong) also smoked opium, injected morphine, openly shielded local tyrants, and fooled around with the daughter of a local tyrant. He usually did not go to the countryside much, and when he did, he asked the masses for chickens to eat. Every time he went to the county for meetings, he had to bring 400,000 to 500,000 yuan for smoking cigarettes, eating snacks, and treating guests to restaurants. He considered himself to be in control of great power, and even if he made mistakes, he would only receive some criticism.

    (6) Serious sectarianism. This is reflected in the poor relationship between new and old cadres. Some Party members looked down on new cadres. They were arrogant and complacent, considered themselves meritorious, and had a serious style of coercion and command. They used emotional ties to win over cadres below them when they needed them, but scolded and attacked them when they didn't. When 王志荣 (Wang Zhirong) assigned work to subordinates, he often said, "If you don't complete the task, you will be beheaded and severely punished." At the rectification meeting, 非党干部 (non-Party cadre) 李锡成 (Li Xicheng) made suggestions to 王志荣 (Wang Zhirong), and Wang scolded: "Huh! Do you want to be a counter-revolutionary!" As a result, upright cadres were very depressed and did not work with peace of mind. Secondly, the members of the County Committee were not united, each drawing in a group of cadres, attacking each other, and acting in their own way. Upright cadres had no place to raise their opinions, while cadres of poor quality seized on the County Committee's mistakes and weaknesses, stirred up trouble, sowed discord, and provoked relations between superiors and subordinates. This made the Party organization in Suichuan County unable to communicate up and down, disintegrated, and lost its combat effectiveness.

    Based on the above situation, the problem in Suichuan County is not a matter of individual cadres violating discipline, nor is it a general error in the leadership of the County Committee, but rather that the County Committee has committed extremely serious principled errors in politics, organization, and ideology. They have become corrupt and degenerate, and have metamorphosed.

    The reasons for these erroneous ideas in the Suichuan County Committee are: First, the members of the Suichuan County Committee were overwhelmed by the victorious situation of the national revolution, and produced arrogance, complacency, underestimation of the enemy, corruption, degeneration and other ideas. This is the main root of the errors of the Suichuan County Committee. Although 焦尔恭 (Jiao Ergong), the County Party Secretary, and others had participated in the revolution for a long time, their thinking had not been truly transformed, and there was still a strong backward peasant consciousness and petty-bourgeois consciousness. This kind of thinking rose and developed in the victorious situation and became a prisoner of bourgeois ideology. Second, within the Party organization of Suichuan County, some Party members had impure motives for joining the Party and going south, and some individuals were impure in composition. These people held responsible positions in the Suichuan Party organization, coupled with the erroneous leadership of the County Committee, which further fostered the development of their erroneous ideas. Third, the CPC Ji'an Prefectural Committee had poor ideological leadership and a serious bureaucratic style, and should bear certain responsibility for the errors of the Suichuan County Committee. As early as March 1950, the Ji'an Prefectural Committee had discovered some errors in the Suichuan County Committee, but failed to conduct timely and in-depth inspections, expose them, and strictly correct them, so that errors that could have been corrected and losses that could have been avoided were not corrected and avoided. Fourth, the CPC Jiangxi Provincial Committee failed to urge the Ji'an Prefectural Committee to deal with the errors of the Suichuan County Committee in a timely manner.

    In order to recover the adverse effects caused by the errors of the Suichuan County Committee among the masses, the CPC Jiangxi Provincial Committee instructed the new Suichuan County Committee to suggest that the County People's Government convene people's representatives from all walks of life to announce the handling process of the errant organizations and individuals, listen to the opinions of the masses, and answer the questions raised by the masses. For all the funds that belong to the fruits of the masses' struggle that have been embezzled, etc., the new County Committee must be responsible for clarifying and earnestly returning or compensating them.

    中共遂川县委大部成员蜕化变质
    江西省委严予处分并作自我检讨
    中国共产党江西遂川县委员会的成员，在全国革命胜利后，由于受了资产阶级思想的侵袭而蜕化变质，使党的工作、国家的财富、党和人民政府在群众中的政治威信都遭受了不可估量的损失。中国共产党江西省委为了严肃党纪，纯洁组织，决定给予遂川县党的组织以撤销其领导机关的处分；给予县委书记焦尔恭以开除党籍的处分，给予县委委员孙元法（遂川县县长）以留党察看一年的处分，并建议政府撤销其县长职务；给予鲁斌（县公安局长）以开除党籍的处分，并建议政府将其撤职法办；给予韩峰（县委宣传部长）以当众警告的处分；中共吉安地方委员会对遂川县委的问题采取了自由主义的态度，给予指责处分；其余犯错误严重的，也都分别作了处理，如王志荣（区委书记）已给予开除党籍的处分，并建议司法机关将其依法处以极刑。中共江西省委员会对这一问题处理不及时，也作了自我检讨。
    遂川县委员会及其成员所以蜕化变质，绝不是偶然的。他们入城不久，生活就逐渐腐化，邪气逐渐上升。县委会四个委员之间则互相猜忌勾心斗角。于是少数成份不纯和思想不纯的分子更加放肆，其他干部也跟着学样；正派干部陷于孤立，受到讽刺和打击，一时造成全县大多数党员干部严重贪污腐化的风气。遂川人民咒骂那些坏干部“比国民党还厉害”。据现有材料统计，由于贪污腐化、铺张浪费及其他各种违法乱纪的行为而使国家财富和人民财产所受到的损失，约达十亿元之多。
    这种严重现象，中共吉安地方委员会领导同志在前年三月间即有所闻，也曾先后三次派人前往检查，但由于他们的官僚主义作风和自由主义态度，未能及时发现问题、解决问题。直到去年二月间，地委书记李立和、副书记朱继先亲往遂川领导整风，才把问题彻底揭露出来。
    中共遂川县委的主要错误是：
    （一）违反政策、法令，敲诈勒索，强征暴敛，自立税目，擅收各种行佣款。据九个区的统计，他们用这些非法方法，骗取一千八百一十六万多元。堆前区前任区委书记陆地以开诊疗所为名，骗取群众八百八十一万多元，拿这些钱来投机倒把，以后才用赚来的钱开诊疗所。后任堆前区区委书记王志荣，吸食鸦片，因为在一家糕饼店没有买到烟土，竟把这家糕饼店封闭了一夜。他藉口禁烟、扣押群众二十多人，企图勒索。他在没钱用的时候，就向各村摊派，甚至到县里开整风会议，还要每乡送十万元路费，前后敲诈勒索达一百九十四万元。
    （二）违犯财经纪律，破坏财经制度。自遂川解放到去年二月，全县财政经济始终未能统一起来，特别是动用公款、乱开支的现象和机关生产账目和经费账目不分的现象是普遍的。县长孙元法擅自动用税款共两千万元用于机关生产。罚款和没收物资不交国库，大部分用于机关生产，一部分被干部贪污浪费掉了。地委指示不准作木材买卖，县委却大规模地贩卖木材，共卖木材一千八百三十二两，获利四亿元（现存木材还有二千四百两）。这种机关生产的盈利，绝大部分都被干部贪污浪费掉了。此外，滥用人员，随便使用马匹，也造成很大浪费。
    （三）严重的无组织无纪律和官僚主义作风。有些重大问题，既未经县委会讨论，又未正式请示上级批准，即擅自决定。如一九五○年春焦尔恭轻率地决定在全县修筑公路二百九十八·三五华里，共费人工二十六万五千九百多个，占用民田二百多亩，砍伐树木一万九千七百多株（内有茶油树二百八十多株），拆毁房屋二十四间，平民坟十一穴，平鱼塘一个，花费稻谷百多万斤，结果不能通车，而树木、房屋、鱼塘等又未补偿群众。又如县粮食局局长假修仓库之名，用整个修建费的三分之一的巨款（折人民币一亿元以上），盖了一座两层楼的办公室，结果使仓库减少一百八十万斤稻谷的容量。地委、专署追查此事时，县委书记焦尔恭、县长孙元法竟以不知作答。县委书记和县长很少下乡，许多人都骂他们是“官僚派”。部分区委书记、区长也照样坐在区上发号施令。有些区委书记，利用县委领导干部不深入下层的弱点，层层作假报告，欺骗隐瞒，各自为政，胡作非为。如区委书记王志荣听说要实行财经统一，就赶紧造假账，来欺骗领导机关。
    （四）丧失阶级立场。如公安局长鲁斌到前国民党县党部书记长刘匪春林家去了解刘匪情况时，刘匪妻女设筵招待，刘匪女稚莉亲自作陪，并赋诗劝酒，鲁斌当晚就宿在刘家。以后鲁斌介绍刘稚莉在县城当小学教员，两人来往密切。刘稚莉每到公安局，鲁斌即殷勤招待，两人往往鬼混到深夜。县人民政府和县委几次得知刘匪确实下落，鲁斌竟两次派刘匪之妻去“争取”，结果使刘匪逃得更远。另一方面，鲁斌对于工人却百般苛待，拖欠工人工资，并轻信谗言，不加调查研究，不听工人申辩，不和工会商量，随便捕押工人。
    遂川县委员会对于鲁斌的这些丧失阶级立场的行为，从未进行严肃处理，相反的还加以袒护。如江西日报揭露了公安局无理扣押工人的情形，县委会就把鲁斌的错误，推到下级干部马金升身上，给马以处分，对鲁斌则没有处理。
    （五）极端严重的铺张浪费、贪污腐化行为。根据中共吉安地方委员会检查，遂川县干部直接贪污浪费公款的数目，约一亿四千万元（其他各种实物等还不在内）。从县到区，吃喝方面的浪费很大。除了公开吃喝以外，一切无法报销的费用，都记在“招待费”项下。全县的加菜费和招待零用费，据不完全统计，共开支一千二百五十五万元。部分坏干部（从东北地区来的）甚至公开说：“我们从东北来到这里，是为的什么？吃点喝点没关系。”县公安局长鲁斌强调特殊，随便动用机关生产费七百八十多万元。区委书记王志荣个人的贪污浪费数字，则达八百多万元。王志荣并抽大烟、扎吗啡，公开包庇恶霸，和恶霸女儿在一起鬼混。他平时不大下乡，下乡就向群众要小鸡吃。每次上县里开会，都要带四、五十万元，作为抽香烟、吃点心、请客上馆子之用。他自认为掌握了大权，犯了错误，顶多受点批评而已。
    （六）严重的宗派主义。这表现在：新老干部之间的关系恶劣。部分党员瞧不起新干部。他们骄傲自满，功臣自居，并有着严重的强迫命令作风。对下面的干部，用得着就感情拉拢，用不着就谩骂打击。王志荣给下边布置工作时，动辄说“完不成任务就要杀头、严办”。在整风会上，非党干部李锡成对王志荣提了意见，王便骂：“哼！你要反革命吗！”因此，正派的干部十分苦闷，不安心工作。其次，县委委员之间不团结，各自拉拢一批干部，互相打击，各行其事。正派干部有意见无处提，而品质不好的干部，抓住县委的错误和弱点，兴风作浪，搬弄是非，挑拨上下级关系。这就使得遂川县的党组织内上下不通气，四分五裂，失去了战斗力。
    根据上述情况来看，遂川县的问题，不是个别干部违犯纪律的问题，也不是县委领导方面的一般性的错误的问题，而是县委会在政治上、组织上和思想上犯了极端严重的原则错误，他们已经腐化堕落，蜕化变质。
    遂川县委发生这些错误思想的原因：一、由于遂川县委员会的成员被全国革命胜利形势冲昏了头脑，产生了骄傲自满、轻敌麻痹、腐化堕落等思想，这是遂川县委员会产生错误的主要根源。县委书记焦尔恭等人虽然参加革命时间较长，但其思想并没有真正得到改造，还存在着浓厚的农民落后意识和小资产阶级意识，这种思想在胜利形势下抬头和发展起来，成为资产阶级的思想俘虏。二、由于遂川县党的组织内，有一部分党员的入党动机和南下动机不纯，同时也有个别分子成份不纯。这些人在遂川党的组织内都居于负相当责任的地位，加上县委会的错误领导，更助长了他们的错误思想的发展。三、中共吉安地方委员会的思想领导很差，并存在着严重的官僚主义作风，对遂川县委员会的错误应负一定的责任。远在一九五零年三月间，吉安地委会就已发现遂川县委员会的一些错误，但没有及时深入检查、揭发，严格加以纠正，使得可能纠正的错误和可能避免的损失未能纠正和避免。四、中共江西省委员会未能督促吉安地方委员会对遂川县委员会的错误及时进行处理。
    为了挽回由于遂川县委员会的错误在群众中所造成的不良影响，中共江西省委员会指示新的遂川县委员会建议县人民政府召开各界人民代表会，宣布对犯错误的组织和个人的处理经过，听取群众意见，解答群众所提出的问题。凡属贪污的群众斗争果实等等的款项，新的县委员会必须负责查清，切实退还或赔偿。（原载长江日报）
