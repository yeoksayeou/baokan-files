    The Collective Office Method of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is Worthy of Reference for Other Agencies
    The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government began collective office work on December 18th of last year. Except for departments such as confidential matters, personnel, documentation, and general affairs, everyone from the Minister to the clerks works in a large room. Collective office work has achieved significant results: (1) Documents are processed more quickly than before. The registration procedures for receiving and sending documents have been reduced from eleven times to three times. The time for completing documents has gone from 39 percent completed in seven days to 97 percent. The time from drafting a document to signing and reviewing has decreased from four days to ten hours. (2) Liaison is more convenient. In the past, it was necessary to run to four or five rooms to study a document, but now it can be done with a single conversation in the office. (3) In the past, due to the more complex document handling procedures, backlog and disconnections between higher and lower levels occurred from time to time, but this has now been basically eliminated. (4) The office is quiet and serious, which has promoted the enthusiasm of comrades for their work. (5) Manpower and material resources have been saved. The number of receiving and dispatching personnel alone has been reduced from ten to four. Each department feels that it can appropriately streamline some personnel. The number of telephone lines in the office has been reduced by one-third, the number of lights by nearly one-half, and the number of rooms by nearly one-half.
    Initially, some people doubted the effectiveness of the collective office method, saying, "The phone rings wildly, people are noisy, and everyone is bustling around, making it impossible to think deeply about problems." To solve these difficulties, a telephone room and a conference room were specially set up, and three rest periods were scheduled during office hours. After two weeks of trial implementation, everyone felt that the collective office was very quiet and intense, the phenomenon of freedom and looseness disappeared, and work efficiency improved. Those who had doubts before all said that collective office work has many benefits that could not be achieved by decentralized office work in the past.
    Such collective office work is successful. Not only is it economical, but it has also initially overcome the bureaucratic style of work and is worthy of being provided as a reference for other agencies. Central People's Government Ministry of Internal Affairs

    内务部集体办公的办法值得其他机关参考
    中央人民政府内务部在去年十二月十八日开始集体办公。除机要、人事、文书、总务等部门外，从部长到办事员，都在一个大房间办公。集体办公已获得显著成绩：（一）公文处理较前迅速。公文收进、发出的登记手续，从十一次减到三次。公文办结时间，过去七天办出的占百分之三十九，现在七天办出的占百分之九十七。公文撰稿后到签发、审阅时间，从四天减到十小时。（二）联系方便。过去为了研究一个文件，须跑四、五个房间，现在不出办公室，一谈就行了。（三）过去因公文运转手续较多，不时发生积压和上下脱节的现象，现已基本消除。（四）办公室内安静、严肃，促进了同志们的工作积极性。（五）节省了人力物力。只收发人员就从十人减到四人。各司都感到可以适当地精简些人。办公室电话台数节省了三分之一，电灯数节省近二分之一，房间节省近二分之一。
    开始，有些人怀疑集体办公的办法不好，说：“电话乱叫、人声嘈杂、万头攒动，不能深入思考问题。”为解决这些困难，专设电话室、会议室，规定办公时间内休息三次。两周试行结果，大家感到：集体办公很安静，很紧张，自由散漫的现象没有了，工作效率提高了。以前怀疑的人都说，集体办公的好处很多，是过去分散办公办不到的。
    这样的集体办公，是成功的。不但节约了，而且初步克服了文牍主义作风，值得提供其他机关参考。  中央人民政府内务部
