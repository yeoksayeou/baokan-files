The Reading Group in Kaoshan Village, Haiyang County, Shandong Province Becomes a Motivator and Organizer for the Masses

Kaoshan Village in Haiyang County, Shandong Province, has a total of 244 households with 1,242 people. The village has 38 reading groups, subscribing to 36 newspapers. Over 800 people regularly participate in listening to the news, accounting for over 60% of the village's population over the age of sixteen.

In the summer of 1945, Comrade Yu Fangshui, the Secretary of the CCP Kaoshan Village Branch, was hired as a correspondent by the Jiaodong Dazhong (Masses) Newspaper at the Jiaodong District Hero and Model Conference. Since then, in addition to actively writing articles, he often went to places where the masses gathered to read the newspaper to everyone. When the heroic deeds of Comrade Yu Fangshui using landmines to kill Japanese devils were published in the newspaper, the masses read news about their own village for the first time, which further increased their interest in reading the newspaper. That year, more than 80 farmers regularly participated in the reading group. In the autumn of 1946, Comrade Yu Fangshui joined the army, and the newspaper reading work was no longer led by anyone, and gradually declined until it stopped. In the spring of 1948, Comrade Yu Fangshui returned from the front, just in time for the famine, and the masses were ideologically confused. He found that Li Baokui's method of digging ground dates to survive the famine was very good, so he wrote an article and sent it to the newspaper. After the newspaper published this article, he organized the masses to discuss it, which improved the masses' confidence in production and self-rescue, and broke the masses' dependent thinking of waiting for relief. More than 80 households in the village participated in digging ground dates, and basically survived the spring famine. Through this incident, the CCP village branch further recognized the importance of newspaper reading work and decided to first have Comrade Yu Fangshui personally organize four reading groups; assigning special personnel to be responsible for the distribution of newspapers to ensure that newspapers are delivered to subscribers in a timely manner, regardless of rain or snow. The branch also called on the masses to read newspapers through various meetings. That autumn, twenty-one "little teachers" were trained to read the newspaper to everyone on time. Now, most of the masses in this village have developed the habit of reading newspapers. Whether they go up the mountain to work or go out to do business, they always carry the newspaper with them and read it when they have time; those who are illiterate also hold the newspaper and look for someone to read it everywhere. They said, "If I don't see the newspaper that day, it feels like something is missing in my heart!" Zhai Da Niang, a 64-year-old military family member, would come over to listen whenever the militiamen read the newspaper, regardless of wind or rain. The villagers called her "Old Newspaper Fanatic."

In Kaoshan Village, if you just ask someone, "Why are you so active in reading the newspaper?" they will say, "I have benefited from reading the newspaper." Indeed, because of the development of newspaper reading work, the newspaper has played a great role in propaganda, motivation, and organization among the masses, which has powerfully promoted various tasks. In February last year, the newspaper published the "Ten Policies for Developing Agriculture" issued by the East China Military and Political Committee. The branch immediately arranged for the reading groups to study, discuss, and promote them. The masses praised these ten policies and said, "These are ten magic weapons." Yu Yinxin, a well-to-do middle peasant who lacked labor, did not dare to hire people to farm for four years because he did not understand the policies in the past. This time, he happily said, "This one is aimed at my heart. If I hire someone this year, I will definitely be able to farm the land better!" The masses learned many good methods of production while reading the newspaper. During the autumn drought last year, wheat could not be planted. The reading group learned about drought-resistant wheat planting methods from the newspaper, carried out extensive publicity, and mobilized all the men, women, and children in the village to work together. In ten days, they carried water to plant 1,500 mu of wheat. In the past, there was a feudal rule in the village: "If there is a mother-in-law, the daughter-in-law does not care about what she wears." Through reading the newspaper and studying, the mother-in-law's thinking was cleared. Last year, during the Spring Festival, every family made new clothes for their daughters-in-law, and the daughters-in-law were more active in participating in field labor, which also improved the relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. In short, the reading group has become a good organization for Kaoshan Village to implement work guidelines and educate the masses.

The Reading Group in Kaoshan Village Promotes Newspaper Reading Work in the Entire District

In June last year, farmers from eleven nearby villages spontaneously organized a newspaper reading visiting group to learn from Kaoshan Village. Now there are 384 reading groups in the whole district, with 3,453 fixed members. On June 11, the Shandong Rural Dazhong (Masses) Newspaper published Comrade Yu Fangshui's challenge to party branch secretaries and reading groups everywhere to run the reading groups well, which more widely promoted the development of newspaper reading work.

Reasons Why the Reading Group in Kaoshan Village Becomes a Motivator and Organizer for the Masses

The reason why the reading group in Kaoshan Village can persist for many years and become a motivator and organizer for the masses is because it has the following conditions:

First, the Party branch attaches importance to the leadership of the reading group. The branch, with Comrade Yu Fangshui as the core, absorbed the active members of the reading group and established a newspaper reading guidance committee. Its task is to provide timely political and technical guidance and training to the newspaper readers based on the current political and production movements; and stipulate that the reading group work be inspected once every half month and summarized once a month.

Second, different materials are selected for different listeners. Generally speaking, elderly farmers like to listen to patriotic and high-yield materials, such as repairing cotton branches, selecting seeds, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests; young people are willing to listen to stories about fighting and freedom of marriage; middle-aged women like to listen to things about midwifery, raising children, and raising chickens. Therefore, the Kaoshan Village branch accepted the requirements of the masses and formed reading groups for the elderly, young people, and women respectively on a voluntary basis. For some major domestic and foreign events and important policies and regulations, all groups generally study them. During the busy farming season, field newspaper reading work is carried out to adapt to the production situation.

Third, strengthen the training and preparation work of newspaper readers. Before reading the newspaper, the Kaoshan Village Newspaper Reading Guidance Committee often convenes newspaper readers to study collectively. If there are difficult places to understand, people with higher education levels will first explain them. Advanced newspaper reading methods and experiences can also be exchanged in a timely manner.

Fourth, the propagandists and reading groups in Kaoshan Village are closely integrated. Propagandists must carefully study the newspapers, understand the policies, and use the powerful propaganda organization of the reading group to conduct propaganda to the masses. Among the thirty-two propagandists in Kaoshan Village, twelve people with more literacy have been selected to serve as newspaper readers, seven people are responsible for running the blackboard newspaper, and the rest have become reading group leaders.

### 山东海阳县靠山村读报组成为群众的鼓动者和组织者

专栏：读报组活动

    山东海阳县靠山村读报组成为群众的鼓动者和组织者
    山东省海阳县靠山村共二百四十四户，一千二百四十二人。全村有三十八个读报组，订报三十六份。经常参加听报的有八百多人，占全村十六岁以上人口的百分之六十强。
    一九四五年夏天，中共靠山村支部书记于芳水同志在胶东区的英雄模范会上，被胶东大众报社聘为通讯员。从此，他除了积极写稿外，并经常到群众集聚的场合，给大家读报。当于芳水同志用地雷炸死日本鬼子的英勇事迹在报上发表后，群众第一次读到自己村里的消息，更提高了读报兴趣。这年，就有八十多个农民经常参加读报组。一九四六年秋天，于芳水同志参军了，读报工作没有人领导，便逐渐消沉，以至停顿。一九四八年春天于芳水同志从前线复员回来，正赶上闹灾荒，群众思想混乱。他发现李保奎刨地枣度荒的办法很好，就写了稿子，送到报馆。报纸发表了这篇稿子，他就组织群众讨论，提高了群众生产自救的信心，打破了群众坐等救济的依赖思想。全村八十多户参加刨地枣，基本上度过了春荒。中共村支部通过这件事，进一步认识了读报工作的重要，决定先由于芳水同志亲自组织四个读报组；确定专人作报纸的发行工作，保证不论下雨下雪，要把报纸及时送到订户手里。支部并通过各种会议，号召群众读报。当年秋天，就培养了二十一个小先生，按时给大家念报。现在，这个村的群众多数都有了读报的习惯，不论是上山干活或出门做生意，总是随身带着报纸，抽空就看；不识字的也拿着报，到处找人念。他们说：“那天不见报，好像心里少了一件事！”六十四岁的军属翟大娘，不论刮风下雨，只要民兵读报，她就凑在一旁听，村里人都叫她“老报迷”。
    在靠山村，只要随便问一个人，“你为什么对读报这样积极呢？”他就会说：“我沾了读报的光。”的确，因为读报工作的开展，报纸在群众中发挥了很大的宣传鼓动和组织作用，有力地推动了各项工作。去年二月，报上登了华东军政委员会颁发的“发展农业的十大政策”，支部立刻就布置读报组学习、讨论和宣传。群众赞扬这十大政策说：“这是十个法宝”。缺乏劳动力的富裕中农于银新，过去因为不了解政策，四年都不敢雇人种地，这次他高兴地说：“这一条是针对着我的心来的，今年雇个人，一定可以把地种得更好一些！”群众在读报当中，学会了许多生产的好法子。去年秋旱，小麦种不上，读报组从报上学到了抗旱种麦的方法，广泛地进行宣传，动员了全村男女老少一齐动手，在十天里，担水种了一千五百亩小麦。过去，村里有个封建规矩：“有婆婆在，不管媳妇穿”。通过读报学习，打通了婆婆的思想，去年过春节，家家都给媳妇做了新衣裳，媳妇更加积极地参加田野劳动，也改善了婆媳间的关系。总之，读报组已经成为靠山村贯彻工作方针，教育群众的良好组织。
    靠山村读报组推动了全区的读报工作
    去年六月，附近十一个村的农民自动地组织了读报参观团，向靠山村学习。现在全区已有三百八十四个读报组，固定的组员有三千四百五十三人。六月十一日，山东农村大众报又发表了于芳水同志向各地党支部书记、各读报组提出办好读报组的挑战书，更广泛地推动了读报工作的开展。
    靠山村读报组成为群众的鼓动者和组织者的原因
    靠山村读报组所以能长年坚持，并成为群众的鼓动者和组织者，是因为它具备了下列条件：
    第一，党支部重视读报组的领导。支部以于芳水同志为核心，吸收读报组的积极分子，成立了读报指导委员会。它的任务是根据当前的政治运动和生产运动，对读报员进行及时的政治和技术的领导和训练；并规定半月检查一次读报组工作，一月作一次总结。
    第二，针对不同的听报对象，选读不同的材料。一般说，老年农民喜欢听爱国丰产的材料，如修整棉杈、选种、防除病虫害的办法；青年人愿意听打仗、婚姻自由的故事；中年妇女喜欢听接生、抚养小孩、养鸡的事情，因此，靠山村支部接受群众的要求，在自愿的原则下，分别组成老人、青年、妇女读报组。对一些国内外的重大事件，重要的政策法令，各组都普遍学习。在农忙的时候，就适应生产情况，开展田间读报工作。
    第三，加强读报员的训练和准备工作。在读报前，靠山村读报指导委员会经常召集读报员集体学习。遇有难懂的地方，先由文化程度较高的人加以解释。先进的读报方法和经验也可及时交流。
    第四，靠山村的宣传员和读报组是密切结合的。宣传员一定要认真学习报纸，体会政策，运用读报组这种有力的宣传组织对群众进行宣传。靠山村三十二个宣传员中，已选出了十二个识字较多的人担任读报员，七人负责办黑板报，其余都当了读报组长。
