(Xinhua News Agency, London, 12th) A mass meeting was held in London on the 9th by the London Peace Committee under the slogan "Strive for Far Eastern Peace". Dr. Joseph Needham, President of the Britain-China Friendship Association and renowned scientist, Mr. Blatter, former Director of the Far East Department of the British Wartime Intelligence Department, and Mr. James Endicott, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, all delivered speeches at the meeting.

Dr. Needham emphasized in his speech the determination of the people of various Far Eastern countries to overthrow colonial rule. He said: This determination is the most important factor in the lives of the people of various Far Eastern countries. The West must recognize that the Asian people are absolutely unwilling to play the role of second-class colonial citizens.

Mr. Blatter pointed out that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has the enthusiastic support of the vast majority of ordinary people and intellectuals throughout the country. He condemned the US government for continuing to implement MacArthur's aggressive policy in the Far East, attempting to use Korea and Taiwan as bases for launching aggressive wars against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. He said: Unless the Americans withdraw from Taiwan and unless the Americans stop aggression, there will be no peace in the Far East. He also said: "This is the time for us to state our position. We want to tell the United States: 'If you are unwilling to do this, we will break with you.'"

Mr. Endicott denounced the US for instigating the Canadian authorities to arbitrarily persecute peace fighters. He pointed out that expanding international trade, reducing armaments, recognizing the People's Republic of China and guaranteeing its legitimate status in the United Nations are the paths to achieving peace in the Far East and peace throughout the world. Mr. Endicott expressed his firm confidence in the peace movement, saying: The peace movement, which unites hundreds of millions of people around the world, is a very important factor influencing the development of history, and this factor cannot be eliminated by the warmongers in Washington. The peace movement will surely defeat them.

    伦敦“争取远东和平”大会
    谴责美国的侵略远东政策
    【新华社十二日讯】伦敦消息：伦敦和平委员会九日在“争取远东和平”的口号下举行群众大会。英中友好协会会长、著名科学家李约瑟博士、前英国战时情报部远东司司长布拉特和加拿大和平大会主席文幼章，都在会上发表了演说。
    李约瑟在演说中强调远东各国人民推翻殖民统治的决心。他说：这种决心是远东各国人民生活中最重要的因素。西方必须认识：亚洲人民绝不肯扮演殖民地次等人的脚色。
    布拉特指出：中华人民共和国的中央人民政府，是得到全国绝大多数普通人民和知识分子热烈拥护的。他谴责美国政府目前正在远东继续执行麦克阿瑟的侵略政策，企图利用朝鲜和台湾作为基地，以便对苏联和中华人民共和国发动侵略战争。他说：除非美国人撤离台湾，除非美国人停止侵略，远东就得不到和平。他又说：“这是我们表明态度的时候了。我们要告诉美国：‘如果你不肯这样做，我们就要和你决裂。’”
    文幼章痛斥美国指使加拿大当局任意迫害和平战士。他指出：扩大国际贸易、裁减军备、承认中华人民共和国并保证它在联合国内的合法地位，是达到远东和平和全世界和平的道路。文幼章表示对和平运动具有坚定的信心，他说：团结着全世界亿万人民的和平运动，是影响历史发展的一个非常重要的因素，这个因素是华盛顿的战争制造者无法消除的。和平运动一定会使他们失败。
