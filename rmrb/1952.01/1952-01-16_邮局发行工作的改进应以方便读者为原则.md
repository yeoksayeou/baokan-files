    Improving the Postal Distribution Work Should Prioritize Convenience for Readers
    Comrade Editor: We feel that there are many unreasonable aspects of the postal service's newspaper distribution work. We are bringing them up now, hoping the postal service will study and improve.
    The post office has a fixed period for newspaper subscriptions. If you are late by a day or two, you won't see the newspaper for a whole month. For example, some readers in Fumin County, Yunnan Province, subscribed to the October issue of the newspaper and paid the subscription fee to the post office in September. However, on October 15th, the Fumin Post Office issued a notice to the readers saying: "Today, we received a telegram from the dispatching office stating that your order for the October People's Daily was delayed by one day and will be changed to be dispatched on November 1st." This means that the entire Fumin County will not see a single copy of the People's Daily in October. Another example is that the Central China Railway Audit Bureau subscribed to a copy of the People's Daily from the Harbin Post Office on December 15th of last year, but had not seen the newspaper by the 19th. Upon inquiry, it turned out that the staff member in charge had forgotten to complete the formalities. They said, "There is no way to fix it, just wait until January of next year to see it!" Since they forgot, they should immediately complete the subscription formalities. Why wait until January of this year to dispatch the newspaper?
    Many students at Yangcun Normal School pay for their own subscriptions to the People's Daily at the post office. Because they will be on winter vacation in the second half of January, they only plan to subscribe to the first half of the month. However, the staff at the Yangcun Post Office said that they can only subscribe to the second half of the month, not the first half, or they have to subscribe for a whole month. The students had no choice but to reluctantly subscribe for a month. The newspapers for the second half of the month will be wasted because the students will be leaving school to go home and no one will be able to see them.
    The above examples all show that the post office in some places only cares about their own convenience at work, but does not consider whether it is convenient for the readers, nor does it consider how great the political loss is for the readers once they lose the guidance of the newspaper. We believe that the postal distribution work should be improved under the principle of convenience for readers.

### 邮局发行工作的改进应以方便读者为原则

    邮局发行工作的改进应以方便读者为原则
    编辑同志：我们感到邮局在报纸发行工作上有很多不合理的地方，现在提出来，希望邮局研究改进。
    邮局订报有一定期限，迟了一两天，一个月就看不到报纸。例如，有些读者在云南富民县邮局订了十月份的报纸，在九月份就把报费交给邮局了；到了十月十五日，富民邮局却发了一个通知给读者说：本日接到发报局电告，你所订的十月份人民日报，订单迟到一日，改为十一月一日发报。这就使得全富民县在十月份内都看不到一份人民日报。又如中长铁路稽核局自去年十二月十五日起向哈尔滨邮局订了一份人民日报，到十九日还看不到报纸。查问的结果，原来是经办人员忘了办理手续，他们说：“没办法，等到明年一月份再看吧！”既然忘了就应该马上补办订报手续，为什么要等到今年一月才发报呢？
    杨村师范学校很多同学都是自己出钱在邮局订人民日报。因为在一月份下半月要放寒假，他们只打算订上半月的报，但是杨村邮局的工作人员却说，只可订下半月的报，不可以订上半月的报，要么就订一个月的。同学们只好勉强订了一个月的。下半月的报纸，由于同学们都要离校回家，没有人能看到，就要造成浪费。
    以上这些例子，都说明某些地方的邮局只是为了自己工作上的方便，却不考虑读者方便不方便，也不考虑读者一旦失去报纸的指导，政治上的损失有多么大。我们认为邮局的发行工作应该在方便读者的原则下加以改进。
