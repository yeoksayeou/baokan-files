    Resolutely Eliminate Thieves Who Steal State Property
    In some of our nation's financial and economic institutions, there exists a group of extremely detestable thieves who steal state assets. Colluding with illegal private merchants, they steal state property on a large scale and continuously, dividing the spoils among themselves. If this group of heinous thieves is not eliminated, the country's property will suffer incalculable losses, and the country's economic construction will be severely impacted. The case of Wang Canwen, the electrical inspection supervisor of the King Kong Laboratory of the East China Industrial Department, and others, who organized large-scale fraud, and the case of seventeen people from the storage section (i.e., warehouse) and business section of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Transportation Bureau, who systematically stole and sold state assets, both published in today's newspaper, illustrate the seriousness of the problem. There are many similar incidents.
    These thieves, hidden within the economic institutions of the people's state, and the unscrupulous merchants outside these institutions, employ various methods to steal state property. They use inferior materials to replace the state's high-quality materials, purchase the state's valuable materials at low prices (some paying only one twenty-sixth of the price), report more sales than actual, reduce percentages, or directly dismantle and steal state materials; in turn, they disguise these stolen state materials and sell them back to the state at high prices; or they modify inferior or used goods purchased cheaply from elsewhere and sell them to the state as good or new goods. With a flip of the hand, they obtain exorbitant profits of several times to dozens of times. They also use the stolen state assets to set up their own business organizations, and through these organizations, they engage in even more extensive theft.
    What lessons should we learn from these events? First, looking at the cadres involved in this kind of theft, the vast majority are former personnel taken over from the Kuomintang reactionary regime (a small number are also old cadres who have degenerated after entering the city). The situation is most serious, especially in institutions where such personnel constitute the majority. The storage section of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Transportation Bureau mentioned above is precisely one such institution. Therefore, institutions taken over from the Kuomintang reactionary faction must be thoroughly rectified and reformed, all staff must receive serious political education, and necessary revolutionary forces must be added to transform them into institutions that serve the people. When using former personnel in newly established revolutionary institutions, these personnel must also undergo revolutionary transformation to establish a revolutionary ideology and work style. If any institution is taken over from the reactionary faction without rectification or transformation, the former personnel will bring their old, corrupt work style completely unchanged to today's use. There are examples of this everywhere. In these institutions, many personnel do not consider colluding with unscrupulous merchants to steal state property as shameful, but rather as a capability. Many former personnel are barely distinguishable from speculative merchants, differing only in superficial identity. Their outlook on life is to benefit oneself at the expense of others, to benefit private interests at the expense of public interests, and to prioritize profit. To make money, they will use any base means. Therefore, former personnel who are retained, especially financial and economic workers and clerical and procurement personnel, must undergo a thorough review. Those whose bad habits are not deeply ingrained and who can be educated and transformed must undergo serious education and transformation; those who cannot be educated and transformed should be purged. Those with significant corruption and fraud should be severely punished according to the law. To excuse them on the grounds that they "came from the old society," or to allow them to develop naturally under the pretext of so-called "transformation through work," will cause significant damage to the country.
    Second, unscrupulous merchants who collude with internal elements to steal state property, or who try every means to lure revolutionary cadres and seriously harm the interests of the state, must also be punished according to the law. Giving bribes and accepting bribes are equally guilty; they cannot be allowed to go unpunished. Because some regions have adopted the erroneous policy of "pursuing money but not prosecuting crimes" towards illegal merchants, these merchants have become increasingly bold and reckless. They basely and unscrupulously use money and women to seduce cadres and drag them down; then they seize upon some indiscreet behavior of certain cadres to blackmail them, forcing these cadres to obey their commands and harm the interests of the state on a larger scale. Regarding this situation, on the one hand, cadres should be educated to boldly confess when they first fall into a trap, and on the other hand, those who offer bribes and seduce must be resolutely attacked, even to the point of using strict legal means, and they must not be allowed to continue to develop.
    Third, strict inspection and supervision systems must be established for cadres who frequently come into contact with and manage large amounts of state assets, and they cannot be left unattended. Loopholes in financial systems and other work systems must be quickly plugged by all means. Song Jian and other corrupt elements of the Shanxi Provincial Transportation Bureau systematically and plannedly stole state property for nearly two years. They not only used various methods such as selling valuable goods at low prices and reducing percentages when selling waste products, but also illegally took "exclusive products" and "non-sale items" for sale, while the leaders seemed to be unaware, and even prepared to promote Song Jian, which shows how serious the state of anarchy and lack of inspection and supervision of cadres in this institution had reached. The material requisition slips of the East China Branch of the National Material Clearing and Allocation Committee's warehouse only wrote simple words like "one distribution board box, incomplete," without specifying what was missing or what specifications were lacking. Intentionally stealing elements will certainly not let go of such an exploitable opportunity. In the King Kong Laboratory, many links such as watching materials, picking up materials, delivering materials, and inspecting and accepting materials were all controlled by Wang Canwen alone, who "handled" everything. What an obvious loophole this was. But the leaders did not even see it! If this state is not changed, even if this group of corrupt elements is removed and replaced by others, there is still a possibility that corruption will continue to occur!
    Particularly noteworthy is the leading cadres' serious irresponsibility towards state property. The person in charge of the King Kong Laboratory had already noticed Wang Canwen's illegal behavior, but he had no sense of responsibility, neither stopping it nor reporting it, but allowing it to continue to develop. He wanted to be a "good person," believing that others' corruption was "unrelated to me." This base and shameful irresponsibility on the part of responsible cadres is the root cause of the serious loss of state property. The corrupt element Wang Canwen dared to openly use the institute's cars and drivers to transport stolen materials, also under the cover and protection of such leaders. Such leaders, even if they themselves have no corrupt or stealing behavior, should be severely punished by Party discipline and sanctioned by national law.
    Some older cadres, such as Huo Qinglin, Director of the Shanxi Provincial Transportation Bureau, as a Communist Party member, did not correct or stop the behavior of cadres below selling waste products at low prices; instead, he saw this as an opportunity to take advantage. Even after the central government had instructed to freeze materials, he introduced his brother to buy cheap goods. Such a phenomenon of having no national concept and only seeing small personal benefits occurring in such responsible cadres is even more worthy of serious alert. Allowing such cadres to continue to hold important leadership positions would have unimaginable harm to the country.
    Therefore, on the one hand, we should mobilize the vast number of cadres and the masses to ruthlessly expose corrupt elements, and actively think of ways to plug loopholes in the system; on the other hand, we must also launch a mass-based irreconcilable struggle against these bureaucratic leaders who lack a sense of responsibility and revolutionary enthusiasm, resolutely expose their mistakes, and remove them from leadership positions. If we do not do so, it will be impossible to effectively change the status quo, and it will be impossible to eliminate these shameless crimes of stealing the people's state property.

### 坚决肃清偷窃国家财产的盗贼

    坚决肃清偷窃国家财产的盗贼
    在我们国家的若干财政经济机构中，有着一批十分可恶的盗窃国家资财的蟊贼。他们和不法的私商勾结起来，大量地不断地盗窃国家的财产，共同分赃。这批罪大恶极的蟊贼如不肃清，国家的财产将要遭到不可计量的损失，国家的经济建设将要受到极端严重的影响。今天本报公布的华东工业部经理处金刚试验所电气检验主管人王灿文等有组织地大规模地进行舞弊的案件，山西省人民政府交通局保管科（即仓库）和业务科十七人有计划地盗卖国家资财的案件，都说明了问题的严重。同类的事件还有许多。
    这些隐藏在人民国家经济机构内部的盗贼和这机构以外的奸商们结合起来盗窃国家财产的方法，是多种多样的。他们用劣质器材盗换国家的优质器材，用低价盗购国家的贵重器材（有的竟只出了二十六分之一的价钱），卖多报少，减低成数，或者直接了当地将国家器材盗拆而去；转过来，他们又把这些盗自国家的器材改头换面，高价卖给国家；或者是把低价从别处买得的劣货、旧货改装一下，当作好货、新货卖给国家。翻手之间，获得数倍以至数十倍的暴利。并且用偷盗来的国家资财开办了自己的营业机构，经过这些机构更大量地进行盗窃。
    从这些事件中，我们应该接受些什么教训呢？第一，从参加这种盗窃行为的干部来看，绝大部分是从国民党反动派政权下接收过来的旧机关人员（其中也有一小部分是老干部进城以后蜕化了的）。尤其在这种人员占大多数的机关内，情形最为严重。上述山西省人民政府交通局的保管科，正是这类机关之一。因此，对于从国民党反动派手里接收过来的机关，必须进行彻底的整顿和改革，对全体工作人员进行认真的政治教育，并加进必要的革命力量，使它变成为人民服务的机关。在新成立的革命机关中使用旧的人员时，也必须对这些人员进行革命的改造，使他们树立革命的思想作风。如果从反动派手里接收了任何机关而不加整顿、改造，旧的人员就会把过去的一套恶劣作风完全原封不动地搬到今天来使用。这种例子，各地都有。在这些机构中，许多人员并不以勾结奸商偷盗国家财产为耻，而是以此为能。有许多旧人员，和投机商人很少区别，只是表面上身份不同而已。他们的人生观就是损人利己，损公利私，唯利是图。为了发财，他们可以用出任何卑污的手段。因此，对于留用的旧人员，尤其是留用的财政经济工作人员和事务、采购人员，必须进行彻底的审查。对于其中恶习不深、可以教育改造的，必须进行认真的教育改造；不能教育改造的，就应该清除出去。有重大贪污舞弊情形的，必须依法严惩。藉口他们是“旧社会来的”而加以原谅，或者藉口所谓“在工作中可以改造”而任其自然发展，都会给国家造成重大的损害。
    第二，对于勾结内奸分子偷盗国家财产、或千方百计地诱骗革命干部、严重损害国家利益的不法奸商，必须同样依法予以惩办。行贿和受贿同罪，不能任他们逍遥法外。由于某些地区对不法奸商曾经采取了“追款不问罪”的错误政策，以致这些奸商越来越胆大，越放肆。他们卑鄙地肆无忌惮地用金钱、女人来勾引干部，拉干部下水；回头又抓住某些干部失于检点的一些行为进行要挟，使这些干部服从他们的指挥，更大规模地危害国家的利益。对于这种情形，一方面应该教育干部，使他们在初陷圈套时即大胆坦白，另一方面，必须对行贿者和勾引者坚决给以打击，一直到采用严厉的法律手段，绝对不能任其继续发展下去。
    第三，对于经常接触和管理大量国家资财的干部，必须建立严格的检查、监督制度，不能放任不管。财务制度和其他工作制度上的漏洞，必须用一切方法迅速堵塞起来。山西省交通局的贪污分子宋剑等有组织、有计划地偷盗国家财产，时间已近二年。他们不仅在出卖废品时用卖贵报贱、减低成数等各种办法进行舞弊，而且把“专卖品”、“非卖品”都非法拿去出卖，而领导者却似乎一无所知，并准备提拔宋剑，这就说明这个机关的无政府状态、对干部缺乏检查监督，达到了多么严重的程度。全国物资清理调配委员会华东分会仓库提取物资的提单，上面只写了“配电表板箱一具，不全。”之类的简单字句，并不注明缺些什么，什么规格。蓄意盗窃的分子们当然不会放松这样一个可乘的机会。在金刚试验所，看料、提料、送料、验收等许多关节都掌握在王灿文一人之手，由他一人“代劳”，这又是多么明显的漏洞。但是，领导者竟都没有看见！这种状态如果不加改变，即使撤除了这一批贪污分子，换来别的人，仍然有可能继续发生贪污事件！
    特别值得注意的，是领导干部对国家财产的严重不负责任态度。金刚试验所的负责人已经觉察到王灿文有不法行为，但他竟毫无责任心，既不制止，也不报告，而任其继续发展。他要“作好人”，认为别人贪污“与我无关”。负责干部中这种卑鄙可耻的不负责任态度，就是造成国家财产严重损失的根本原因。贪污分子王灿文竟敢公然利用所里的汽车和司机来装运盗窃的物资，也是以这样的领导人为其掩护和屏障的。这样的领导人，即使他本人没有贪污偷盗行为，也应该受到党纪的严厉的处分和国家法律的制裁。
    有些比较老的干部，如山西省交通局局长霍清林，身为共产党员，竟然对下面干部贱卖废品的行为，毫不加以纠正和制止；反而把这看成占便宜的机会。甚至在中央已经指示要冻结物资之后，还介绍他的哥哥来买便宜货。这样毫无国家观念、只看见个人一点小利的现象，竟发生在这样负责的干部身上，更值得引起严重的警惕。让这样的干部继续担任重要的领导工作，对国家的危害就将不堪设想。
    因此，我们一方面应该动员广大的干部、群众起来无情地检举贪污分子，并积极地想办法堵塞制度上的漏洞；另一方面，必须同时对这种毫无责任心和革命热情的官僚主义领导者展开群众性的不调和的斗争，坚决揭发他们的错误，把他们从领导岗位上撤下来。不如此，就不可能有效地改变现状，就不可能肃清这些盗窃人民国家财产的无耻罪行。
