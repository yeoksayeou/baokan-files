    The Central Executive Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the China Association for Promoting Democracy
    Separately instruct local organizations to carry out the anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign
    The Central Executive Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the China Association for Promoting Democracy have separately issued instructions or notices to their respective local organizations at all levels regarding the launch of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.
    The instructions from the Central Executive Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association pointed out that opposing corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is an important link in the three central tasks of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing economy, and ideological remolding. All party members must resolutely support and implement this political task. The instructions stipulated that the China Democratic National Construction Association's organizations at all levels should immediately establish economy inspection committees to conduct inspections, denunciations, and self-criticisms from top to bottom, from bottom to top, and among various business departments in a planned and systematic manner. Organizations at all levels should immediately formulate implementation plans for economy inspections based on local conditions.
    The notice from the China Association for Promoting Democracy stated: The struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is a struggle against the decadent ideologies of feudalism and capitalism. This movement is also a learning movement—an ideological remolding movement—for the association's organization. It will have a very significant impact on raising the political awareness of members, strengthening ideological leadership, improving working methods, and purifying and consolidating the organization. Therefore, it is imperative to take immediate action, fully promote democracy, and conduct mutual inspections, self-criticisms, and denunciations from top to bottom and from bottom to top. The notice also requested organizations at all levels to mobilize members to conduct propaganda and education work among the masses, so that everyone feels that corruption and waste are the most shameful, and that hard work and simplicity are the most glorious. In particular, members serving in primary and secondary schools should be mobilized to educate young students and children, so that they can influence their families, to shift the old social atmosphere and cultivate new morals.

    中国农工民主党中央执行局和中国民主促进会
    分别指示各地方组织开展反贪污浪费运动
    中国农工民主党中央执行局和中国民主促进会分别向它们的各级地方组织发出关于开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的指示或通知。
    中国农工民主党中央执行局的指示指出：反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义，是抗美援朝、增产节约、思想改造三大中心任务的重要环节。要全体党员坚决拥护并贯彻执行这一政治任务。指示规定中国农工民主党的各级组织应即成立节约检查委员会，有计划、有步骤地进行自上而下、自下而上以及各业务部门相互之间的检查、检举和检讨。各级组织应即根据当地具体情况，拟订节约检查实施计划。
    中国民主促进会的通知说：反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争就是对封建主义和资本主义的腐朽思想作斗争。这一运动对会的组织来说也是一个学习运动——思想改造运动。它对于提高会员政治觉悟，加强思想领导，改进工作方法，纯洁与巩固组织将发生十分重大的影响。因此必须立即行动起来，充分发扬民主，自上而下和自下而上地相互进行检查、检讨和检举。通知并要求各级组织动员会员向群众进行宣传教育工作，使人人感觉贪污、浪费最可耻，坚苦朴实最光荣。特别要发动在中小学中服务的会员，向青年学生、儿童进行教育，使他们去影响他们的家庭，以转移旧社会风气培养新道德。
