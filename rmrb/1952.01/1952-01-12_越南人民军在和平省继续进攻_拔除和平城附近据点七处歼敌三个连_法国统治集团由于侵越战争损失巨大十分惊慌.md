Xinhua News Agency, Hoa Binh Front, 10th: The Vietnamese People's Army eliminated seven French aggressor strongholds near Hoa Binh city, the capital of Hoa Binh province, southwest of Hanoi, on the 7th and 8th, annihilating more than three enemy companies.
	The Vietnamese People's Army began its attack at midnight on the 7th, and eliminated an enemy stronghold north of Hoa Binh city in five minutes. About fifteen minutes later, the People's Army occupied the enemy airport's artillery stronghold, killing all the guards inside and destroying four 105mm howitzers. Two hours later, the People's Army eliminated two more strongholds north of Hoa Binh city. By 4:00 a.m. on the 8th, the People's Army had eliminated three more strongholds north of Hoa Binh city. During the offensive, the Vietnamese People's Army's artillery fire overwhelmed the enemy artillery fire from the Rong Village stronghold on the opposite bank of the Black River southeast of Hoa Binh City, and destroyed a 75mm howitzer. The headquarters of French Colonel Crément was also hit and caught fire.
	In addition to eliminating seven strongholds and destroying five artillery pieces, this battle resulted in more than three enemy companies killed or wounded, the capture of 45 European and African soldiers from the French mercenary army, and the seizure of a large amount of military supplies. The Vietnamese People's Army's artillery also destroyed a French aggressor transport plane at Hoa Binh City Airport.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The heavy losses suffered by French imperialism in the war of aggression against Vietnam have greatly alarmed the French ruling clique. The recent French National Assembly debates on the 1952 national budget powerfully demonstrated this situation. French Minister of Relations with the Associated States of Indochina, Letourneau, recently admitted in the French National Assembly that the number of French soldiers killed and missing in the war of aggression against Vietnam has been constantly increasing since 1945. According to the figures announced by Letourneau, which are obviously greatly reduced, the number of French soldiers killed and missing each year from 1945 to 1950 (note: the losses of the Bao Dai puppet army are not included) are: 367, 2828, 4081, 4821, 4872, 8749. Among them, the number of French officers lost also increased from 24 in 1945 to 187 in 1950.
	According to the reports submitted to the French National Assembly by Dupond, the special rapporteur of the Finance Committee of the French National Assembly, and Massot, the rapporteur of the Overseas Territories, the French military budget for the war of aggression against Vietnam in 1952 has increased from 189.098 billion francs in 1951 to 326.093 billion francs. However, according to estimates by former French Prime Minister and leader of the French Radical Socialist Party, Daladier, the cost of the war of aggression against Vietnam in 1952 will require around 430 billion francs. In terms of the number of invading troops, the 1952 budget has also increased from 144,000 in 1951 to 173,000.
	The French ruling clique is extremely alarmed by the increasing drain on French manpower and financial resources in the war of aggression against Vietnam. Referring to the impact of the war of aggression against Vietnam on France's pursuit of the US arms expansion policy, Letourneau said that France's burden in Indochina has complicated its work in Europe. Daladier said sadly in the National Assembly that France has become a "prisoner of the rice paddies of Indochina."
	After suffering serious defeats in the war of aggression against Vietnam, the French ruling clique is now increasingly placing its hopes for reversing the defeat on US imperialism. Both Daladier and Letourneau proposed the "internationalization" of the war of aggression against Vietnam in the French National Assembly, hoping that US and British imperialism could participate more in their shameful collusion against the Vietnamese people. According to an announcement by the US Department of Defense on the evening of the 7th, at the request of France, the chiefs of staff of the United States, Britain, and France will hold a meeting in Washington on January 11 to discuss the so-called "Southeast Asia defense issue." This meeting is closely related to the conspiracy of the US, British, and French imperialist groups to strengthen their aggression in Vietnam and other parts of Southeast Asia.

    越南人民军在和平省继续进攻
    拔除和平城附近据点七处歼敌三个连
    法国统治集团由于侵越战争损失巨大十分惊慌
    【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社和平前线十日讯：越南人民军在七日和八日拔除了河内西南和平省省会和平城附近的法国侵略军据点七处，歼灭敌军三个连以上。
    越南人民军在七日午夜开始攻击，五分钟后就拔除了和平城以北的一处敌军据点。约十五分钟以后，人民军占领了敌军机场的炮兵据点，击毙该据点内的所有守军，并击毁一零五公厘口径的大炮四门。两小时以后，人民军又拔除了和平城以北的另外两个据点。到八日早晨四时，人民军又拔除了和平城以北的另外三个据点。在进攻的时候，越南人民军的炮火压倒了从和平城东南面黑水江对岸的嵘村据点发射过来的敌军大炮的炮火，并击毁敌军七五公厘口径大炮一门。法军上校克里蒙的司令部也被击中起火。
    这一次的战果除拔除据点七处、击毁大炮五门外，共毙伤敌军三个连以上，俘掳法国雇佣军欧洲和非洲部队士兵四十五人，缴获大量军用物资。越南人民军的大炮并曾击毁和平城机场中的法国侵略军运输机一架。
    【新华社十一日讯】法国帝国主义在侵略越南战争中所遭到的惨重损失，使法国统治集团十分惊慌。最近举行的法国国民议会在辩论一九五二年度国家预算的过程中，已把这种情况有力地表现出来。法国的印度支那联邦成员国关系部部长勒都尔诺最近在法国国民议会中承认：法军在侵越战争中阵亡和失踪的人数，自从一九四五年以来，就一直在不断地增加。据勒都尔诺所宣布的显然已大大缩小了的数字，从一九四五年到一九五零年，法军逐年阵亡和失踪的数目（按：保大傀儡军的损失不包括在内）是：三六七名、二八二八名、四零八一名、四八二一名、四八七二名、八七四九名。其中法军军官损失的数目，也由一九四五年的二十四名增加到一九五零年的一八七名。
    据法国国民议会财政委员会特别报告员杜朋和海外领地报告员马梭在法国国民议会中提出的报告，法国一九五二年用在侵越战争上的军费预算，已由一九五一年的一千八百九十亿九千八百万法郎增加到三千二百六十亿九千三百万法郎。但据法国前总理、法国激进社会党领袖达拉第估计，一九五二年的侵越战费需要四千三百亿法郎左右。在侵略军人数方面，一九五二年的预算也已由一九五一年的十四万四千人增加到十七万三千人。
    法国统治集团对于法国在侵越战争中兵员和财力上愈来愈大的消耗极为恐慌。勒都尔诺在提到侵越战争对于法国奉行美国扩军政策的影响时说：法国在印度支那的负担，已使它在欧洲方面的工作变为复杂。达拉第在国民议会中悲哀地说：法国已经成为“印度支那稻田的囚犯了”。
    法国统治集团在侵越战争中遭到严重的失败以后，现在越来越把他们企图挽救失败的希望，放在美帝国主义的身上。达拉第和勒都尔诺在法国国民议会中，都提出了把侵越战争“国际化”的主张，希望美英帝国主义能更多地参加他们反对越南人民的可耻勾当。据美国国防部七日晚宣布：在法国的要求下，美、英、法三国参谋长将在一月十一日在华盛顿举行会议，讨论所谓“东南亚防务问题”。这个会议和美、英、法帝国主义集团阴谋加强它们在越南以及在东南亚其他地方的侵略行动，有密切的关系。
