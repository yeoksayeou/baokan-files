The Soviet Volga-Don Canal is about to open. In early February, river water will be injected into the Karpovka, Bereslavka, and Varvarovka reservoirs, filling the entire riverbed of the canal. Currently, thousands of construction workers are working day and night on earthwork and concrete pouring projects. The thirteen locks, power stations, pumping stations, and other construction projects along the canal are nearing completion. The Bereslavka project, including dams, reservoirs, and spillways, has been fully completed. Dredging work is proceeding intensely at the watershed of the Volga-Don Canal.

In preparation for letting water into the reservoirs, nearly 10,000 private residences, over 2,000 collective farm buildings, and over 1,000 cooperative and state buildings have been relocated in the receiving area. The work of clearing the seabed of the world's largest reservoir, the "Tsimlyansk Sea," is vigorously underway. Thousands of collective farmers from the Stalingrad region and residents of Stalingrad, Kamyshin, and other towns are participating in logging and timber hauling. Factories have also dispatched hundreds of trucks, tractors, and other motor vehicles to assist in the work. To date, more than 400,000 cubic meters of trees have been felled, and forests have been cleared from more than 7,000 hectares (15 mu per hectare) of land.

The canal construction workers have overfulfilled the 1951 earthwork project plan, excavating a total of 27.13 million cubic meters of earth throughout the year. On December 1st of last year, the workers victoriously completed the year's production plan for reinforced concrete, and 65,580 tons of metal frames have been manufactured. Stakhanovite workers working on the construction site have fully utilized the efficiency of powerful Soviet-made machines. For example, the automatic mobile excavator operated by young engineer Uskov and others excavated 2.2 million cubic meters of earth last year.

To welcome the upcoming opening of the canal, Soviet shipbuilders are rushing to build new types of ships. Cherevko, Deputy Minister of the Soviet Inland Water Transport Department, said: New ships are currently being built and old ships are being renovated for navigation on the Volga-Don Canal. The construction and repair of passenger terminals, the reconstruction of ports on the Don and Volga Rivers, and the installation of powerful new loading and unloading machines are all underway. Many 800-horsepower motor passenger ships are being built; each ship has 300 to 350 berths. The first batch of these ships will begin sailing in the 1952 navigation season. Engineers at the Red Sormovo Factory in Gorky City (one of the oldest factories in the Soviet Union) are designing a diesel-electric powered ship with more than 2,000 horsepower. This ship has three decks, is more than 100 meters long, about 15 meters high, and can reach a speed of 25 kilometers per hour. It can carry 500 passengers and is spacious and comfortable. Cherevko said: There has never been such a good inland river passenger ship in the world.

Soon, this new canal connecting the White Sea, Baltic Sea, Caspian Sea, Sea of Azov, and Black Sea will be officially opened.

### 苏联伏尔加河—顿河运河即将开航

    苏联伏尔加河—顿河运河即将开航
    伏尔加河—顿河运河不久就要开航了。二月初，河水就将注入卡尔波夫卡、贝利拉夫卡和瓦尔瓦罗夫卡三个水库，灌满运河的全部河床。现在，数千建筑工人正在昼夜不停地进行土工和浇灌混凝土的工程。运河沿线十三道水闸、发电站、抽水站和其他的建筑工程即将完成。包括堤坝、水库和放水堰等的贝利拉夫卡工程已全部竣工。在伏尔加河—顿河运河的分水岭处，挖泥工作正在紧张地进行着。
    为了准备放水流入水库，人们已经在受水地区迁走了将近一万所私人住宅、二千多座集体农场建筑物和一千多座合作社及国家建筑物。清理世界最大水库——“齐姆良海”海底的工作正在大力进行。数以千计的斯大林格勒州集体农民和斯大林格勒、卡米新等城镇的居民，都参加了伐木和曳木的工作。各工厂也派了数百辆卡车、拖拉机和其他摩托车辆来协助工作的进行。到现在为止，人们已经伐下了四十多万立方公尺的树木，清除了七千多公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）土地上的森林。
    运河的建筑工人已经超额完成了一九五一年的土方工程计划，全年共挖掘了二千七百十三万土方。去年十二月一日，工人们已经胜利地完成了去年全年钢筋混凝土的生产计划，六万五千五百八十吨金属架已经制造出来。在工地上工作的斯塔哈诺夫工作者，充分发挥了苏联制造的强大机器的效率。例如，青年工程师乌斯可夫等操纵的自动移动挖掘机，在去年一年内挖掘了二百二十万土方。
    为了迎接即将开航的运河，苏联造船工人正在赶造新式航船。苏联内河航运部副部长契雷夫科说：目前正在建造新船和改造旧船，以便在伏尔加河—顿河运河上航行。客船码头的建筑与修理、顿河与伏尔加河各港口的重建以及效力强大的新式装货卸货机器的装置等等工作都在进行中。许多八百匹马力的摩托客船正在建造中；每一只船有三百张到三百五十张卧铺。这种船的第一批将在一九五二年航行季中开始航行。高尔基城红色索尔莫沃工厂（苏联资格最老的工厂之一）的工程师正在设计一种两千匹马力以上的柴油电力推动的船，这种船共有三层甲板，长度有一百余公尺，高度大约有十五公尺，速度可以达到每小时二十五公里。它可以搭载乘客五百人，宽敞而舒适。契雷夫科说：世界上从未有过这样好的内河客船。
    不久，这条把白海、波罗的海、里海、亚速海和黑海沟通起来的新运河就要正式开航了。
