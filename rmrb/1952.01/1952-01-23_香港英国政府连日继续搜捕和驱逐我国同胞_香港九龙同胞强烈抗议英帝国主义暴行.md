Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd: The Hong Kong British government's atrocities of searching, arresting, and expelling our compatriots are still continuing. Following the deportation of Sima Wensen, Li Wenxing, and seven others, the Hong Kong British government has continued to violently arrest and expel five more people in recent days, including Bai Chen and Jiang Wei, film artists from our country; Xian Peiling, director of the Kowloon City Branch of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Industry General Union; Yao Jian, secretary; and Zhang Sheng, a representative of the fire victims in the Tung Tau Tsuen fire zone in Kowloon City. On the 16th, Feng Qin, the finance officer of the Disaster Victims Representative Office in the Tung Tau Tsuen fire zone in Kowloon City, was abducted from his home by plainclothes detectives of the Hong Kong British government and his whereabouts are still unknown. Compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon have expressed extreme indignation at this series of atrocities committed by the Hong Kong British government to persecute the Chinese people. Forty trade unions affiliated with the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions sent representatives to visit the Hong Kong British Government Police Department on the 17th, solemnly stating the attitude of Hong Kong and Kowloon workers towards the Hong Kong government's recent frantic measures to persecute the Chinese people. In addition to lodging a serious protest with the Hong Kong government, they also demanded that the Hong Kong government immediately stop persecuting workers and earnestly guarantee personal safety. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Industry General Union and all the disaster victims in the Tung Tau Tsuen fire zone in Kowloon City have also issued protest letters one after another, strongly protesting against the Hong Kong government's persecution of their union leaders and representatives of the disaster victims. The protest letter from all the disaster victims in the Tung Tau Tsuen fire zone stated: "The Hong Kong government authorities think that using high-handed measures to persecute us can conceal the authorities' improper handling of the disaster victims' problem, but on the contrary, the more they persecute, the clearer the public will recognize: who in Hong Kong today sympathizes with the disaster victims? Who is persecuting the disaster victims? The facts are before our eyes. Hong Kong compatriots and compatriots all over the country are supporting us and helping us, but the Hong Kong British government not only does not help us, but also continues to persecute us, simply forcing all of us disaster victims into a desperate situation!" Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po have received many letters from readers in recent days, denouncing the Hong Kong British government's atrocities of persecuting our compatriots, and expressing sincere condolences to the persecuted compatriots.

    香港九龙同胞强烈抗议英帝国主义暴行
    【新华社广州二十二日电】香港英国政府搜捕和 驱逐我国同胞出境的暴行尚在继续。继司马文森、李文兴等九人被递解出境之后，香港英国政府连日又继续横暴地将我国电影艺术工作者白沉、蒋伟、港九纺织染业总工会九龙城支会主任冼佩玲、书记姚坚，九龙城东头村火灾区灾民代表张生等五人逮捕并驱逐出境。九龙城东头村火灾区灾民代表办事处财政股股长冯钦在十六日被香港英国政府便衣警探从家中架走，至今下落不明。香港、九龙同胞对香港英国政府这一连串迫害中国人民的暴行表示万分愤慨。港九工会联合会属下的四十个工会在十七日派代表往访香港英国政府警务处，严正申明港九工人对香港政府最近疯狂迫害中国人民措施的态度。他们除向香港政府提出严重抗议外，并要求香港政府立即停止迫害工人的措施，切实负责保障人身安全。港九纺织染业总工会、九龙城东头村火灾区全体灾民也先后发出了抗议书，强烈抗议香港政府迫害他们的工会领袖和灾民代表。东头村火灾区全体灾民的抗议书中说：“香港政府当局以为用高压手段来迫害我们就可遮瞒当局对灾民问题处理的不当，但是刚刚相反，越迫害，社会人士也就认识更清楚：今天在香港究竟谁是同情灾民？谁是迫害灾民？事实摆在眼前，香港同胞和全国同胞都在支持我们，救济我们，唯独香港英国政府不独不救济我们，反而不断迫害我们，简直迫我们全体灾民走向绝境！”香港大公、文汇报连日收到读者不少来信，痛斥香港英国政府迫害我国同胞的暴行，并向被迫害的同胞致以热诚的慰问。
