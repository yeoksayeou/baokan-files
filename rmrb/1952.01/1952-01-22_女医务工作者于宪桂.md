Female Medical Worker Yu Xiangui

During the Fifth Campaign in Korea, the enemy launched an attack on our side in a certain area, and the situation was extremely urgent. The regimental headquarters ordered the wounded and sick in the rear wounded reception station to transfer immediately. Female medical worker Yu Xiangui and her comrades immediately carried out the task, lifting the stretchers and leaving. It was late at night, and the Korean mountains were full of small paths. The road was uneven, and they could only grope forward step by step. At this time, the enemy's artillery fire became increasingly intense, and they had to carry the wounded from the small path to the highway, walking back and forth for four or five li. Yu Xiangui thought, "We must hurry up and carry them. We must not let our volunteer wounded and sick soldiers stay behind and suffer the enemy's poison!" She quickened her pace. The stretcher was very heavy, making Yu Xiangui dizzy and unable to breathe. She felt her strength getting weaker and weaker, and sweat poured down like rain. As she ran, she thought, "Who gave us these difficulties? It's American imperialism. Aren't we here to fight the American devils? Overcoming difficulties is a heavy blow to the enemy." After carrying several seriously wounded soldiers, she finally fainted. She was awakened by another comrade, and the comrades asked her to rest. At this time, the severely wounded soldiers lying in the gullies and forests appeared in her mind. She thought, "There must be no hesitation. There are more seriously wounded soldiers waiting behind. Two people carrying is always faster than one person carrying on their back!" So, she gritted her teeth, supported herself and got up, lifted the stretcher and continued to move forward. This time, she rescued eighteen seriously wounded soldiers, carrying them on her back and lifting them, covering eighty or ninety li in one dark night. The enemy occupied our wounded reception station the night after all the volunteer wounded and sick soldiers successfully reached a safe area.

Yu Xiangui is such an outstanding medical worker with a high degree of patriotism, and an excellent female Communist Party member. Since entering Korea, she has been credited five times. In the Fifth Campaign, she was honorably awarded the first-class merit and won the Military Merit Medal awarded by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Her heroic deeds are deeply remembered in the hearts of the soldiers. (Attached picture)

    女医务工作者于宪桂
    在朝鲜第五次战役中，某地敌人向我方进攻，情况十分紧急。团部下令要后方伤员收容站的伤病员们即刻转移。女医务工作者于宪桂和她的战友们马上执行了任务，抬起担架就走。夜深了，朝鲜的山地尽是小路，路上高低不平，他们只能一步步摸索着前进。这时敌人的炮火越来越紧，把伤病员从小路抬到公路道上，来回得走四、五里。于宪桂想：“得赶紧抬，决不能让咱们的志愿军伤病员们留下，遭受敌人的毒害！”她加快了自己的脚步。担架很重，把于宪桂压得头昏眼花，喘不过气来。她觉得自己的力气越来越小了，汗水像雨一样直往下流。她一面跑，一面想：“这些困难是谁给的？是美帝国主义。咱不是来打美国鬼子吗？克服困难就是狠狠地打击敌人。”抬了几个重伤员以后，她终于昏倒了。她被另一个同志叫醒，同志们要她去休息。这时，在她的脑子里浮起了在山沟里，在树林中躺着的重伤战士们。她想：“决不能有一点犹豫，后面还有重伤员在等着，两个人抬总要比一个人背快得多！”于是，她又咬紧牙关，支撑着爬起身来，抬起担架继续前进。这次，她在一黑夜连背带抬抢救了十八个重伤员，走了八、九十里路。在全部志愿军伤病员顺利到达安全地带的第二天晚上，敌人即占据了我们的伤员收容站。
    于宪桂是这样一个具有高度爱国主义精神的出色的医务工作者，优秀的女共产党员。入朝以来她一共已立了五次功。在第五次战役中，她光荣地立了一等功，并荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国颁发的军功奖章。她的英勇事迹深深地记在战士们的心里。（附图片）
