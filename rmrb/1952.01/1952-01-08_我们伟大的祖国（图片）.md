It is a major task of our people's education to use revolutionary spirit and methods to train a large number of construction talents needed by the country. This is a group of teachers and students from the Chahar Institute of Technology, which was established last summer. In order to build the school buildings, they formed the "Chahar Institute of Technology Labor School Building Committee." They are surveying on the land they have filled in themselves, preparing for construction.
