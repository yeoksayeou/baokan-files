Xinhua News Agency report:

    Tianjin Municipal People's Government has taken decisive measures and arrested fifteen timber merchants in Tianjin on the 22nd, who defrauded the state of huge sums of money and refused to confess. Among them are Wang Weisheng, Chairman of the Timber Business Guild and Manager of Da Lai Timber Company, Du Zhenhua, Manager of Xinhua Timber Company, and Zhang Yunqiao, Manager of Xiangsen Timber Company. All assets of the respective businesses have been completely frozen by the Tianjin Municipal People's Court; the offenders have been handed over to the court for trial and will be severely punished according to law.
    The Tianjin timber business was on the verge of collapse before liberation, with most of the timber seized by the Kuomintang bandits to build bunkers. After liberation, with the help of government loans, the industry quickly prospered. Unexpectedly, these criminals betrayed the people's kindness and have been stealing state assets on a large scale for the past three years, endangering national military projects, corrupting state cadres, disrupting the timber market, and concealing enemy property. After the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-fraud struggle was launched in Tianjin's business community, they further sabotaged the confession and denunciation movement. According to the materials from denunciations, investigations, and preliminary interrogations, the state's stolen and defrauded assets are enormous, and the methods of theft and fraud are extremely despicable and shameless. For example, in October 1950, Da Lai, Xinhua, Hengyu, Tongqing, Dehesheng, Xiangsen, and other timber merchants signed a contract with the Tianjin Office of the Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government to sell a batch of willow wood to the office. These merchants defrauded the office of over 900 million yuan in deposits, and to this day, a year later, they still owe more than 380 cubic meters of timber, in addition to delivering a portion of the timber perfunctorily. During this period, the merchants used the state's large deposits for speculation. According to Zhang Yunhua of Xiangsen Timber Company, they earned profits of over 2.7 billion yuan, more than three times the amount of the deposit, using this method. In early 1951, Xinhua, Xiangsen, and eight other timber merchants signed a contract with the Tianjin Office of the Steel Industry Bureau to sell 7,000 fir poles to the office. By raising the bid price and delaying delivery, Xinhua Timber Company alone earned illegal profits of 260 million yuan, of which four companies did not actually participate in the transaction but also received "profits" of over 20 million yuan. In 1950, during the construction of a military project in a certain area, Da Lai, Hengyu, Xiangsen, Tongqing, and other timber companies sold timber, passing off inferior goods as superior goods and small-sized timber as large-sized timber, reaping huge profits and seriously endangering the military project. Zhou Rubin, Manager of Yonghua Timber Company, consistently bribed cadres to defraud the state of assets. In 1950, when selling a batch of timber to Shandong Construction Company, he defrauded the state of assets totaling 600 million yuan. Zhou frequently solicited deposits and remittances, disrupting finance. In 1951, he handled over 9 billion yuan in remittances, paying out 630 million yuan in black interest throughout the year.
    After the fifteen major merchants were arrested, the vast number of employees and shop assistants in the industry were extremely excited and immediately organized factory protection teams to ensure that not a single piece of timber was lost. Many timber companies' workers held meetings overnight to denounce and accuse the merchants of their various crimes. Xinhua Timber Company's employees have reported 140 instances of the capitalists' crimes.

    天津逮捕十五名木商业大奸商
    有关木行的财产已由法院全部予以冻结
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：天津市人民政府采取断然措施，在二十二日逮捕了诈骗巨额国家资财又拒不坦白的木业奸商十五人。其中有木商业同业公会主任委员、大来木行经理王伟生，新华木行经理杜振华和祥森木行经理张云桥等。各行所有的财产已由天津市人民法院全部予以冻结；各犯已交法院审讯，将依法严惩。
    天津木商业在解放前夕本已奄奄一息，大部木材被国民党匪帮抢去修碉堡。解放后，经人民政府贷款扶助，该业很快繁荣起来。不料各犯辜负人民的恩惠，三年来大量盗窃国家资财，危害国家军事工程，腐蚀国家干部，扰乱木材市场，隐匿敌产；在天津市展开工商界的反行贿、反偷税、反欺诈斗争后，又破坏坦白检举运动。根据检举、调查和初步审讯的材料，国家被盗骗去的资财非常巨大，盗骗的方法非常卑鄙无耻。如：一九五○年十月份，大来、新华、恒裕、同庆、德和生、祥森等木商和中央人民政府重工业部钢铁工业局天津事务所签订合同，售给该所杨柳木一批。该奸商等于骗得定金九亿多元后，至今已经一年，除交付一部分木材敷衍塞责外，还欠交木材三百八十多立方公尺。各该奸商在此期间利用国家大量定金进行投机买卖，据祥森木行张云华供称，就用这样方法，他们赚得了为定金三倍以上的利润二十七亿多元。一九五一年初，新华、祥森等八家木商和钢铁局天津事务所签订合同，售与该所杉杆七千根。由于抬高标价，拖延交货，新华木行一家即赚非法利润二亿六千万元，其中有四家，实际并未参加交易，亦分得“利润”二千多万元。一九五零年修建某地军事工程时，大来、恒裕、祥森、同庆等木行出售木材，以劣货充优货，小尺寸木材冒充大尺寸木材，牟取暴利，使军事工程受到严重危害。永华木行经理周汝斌一贯贿赂干部，诈骗国家资财，一九五零年卖给山东建筑公司一批木材时，诈骗国家资财达六亿元。周犯经常兜揽存款、汇款，扰乱金融，一九五一年经营往来汇款达九十多亿元，全年付出黑利息六亿三千万元。
    以上十五个大奸商被逮捕后，该业广大职工店员极为振奋，立即分别组织护厂队保证不损失一根木材。很多木行的工人连夜集会检举和控诉奸商们的种种罪行。新华木行职工检举资方的罪行已达一百四十件。
