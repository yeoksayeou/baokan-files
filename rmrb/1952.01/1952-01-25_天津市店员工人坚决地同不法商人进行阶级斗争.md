    Tianjin: More than 40,000 shop assistants in private stores throughout Tianjin (accounting for about 80 percent of all shop assistants in private stores) have taken active steps to the forefront of the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship and theft of state economic intelligence, and are vigorously launching struggles against various crimes committed by unlawful merchants that infringe upon the interests of the state and the people. As of January 18, shop assistants throughout the city had held nearly 200 large and small exposure meetings, exposing more than 20,000 cases both inside and outside the meetings. The enthusiasm of shop assistants throughout the city is rare in previous mass movements. Often, before the person chairing the meeting finished speaking, hundreds of pieces of exposure material were sent to the podium. In the past, some industries were dead corners of trade union activities. This time, shop assistants in these industries have also been drawn into the movement. The slogans put forward by the broad masses of shop assistants are: "Set up an inescapable net and don't let a single lawless element escape!" "Fight to the end and don't stop until victory!" "Go deep into the mountains and catch big tigers!"
    The exposure movement by the broad masses of shop assistants has forced unlawful merchants to face up to their crimes. Some unlawful merchants originally held a resistant and perfunctory attitude towards this movement. But when they realized that their crimes could not be concealed from the eyes and ears of the shop assistants, they panicked and had to confess their problems. The manager of the Li Mao Automobile Material Firm, under the siege of the shop assistants, confessed to his repeated bribery and tax evasion, and reported 740 taels of gold in off-book funds. The capital side of a certain lumber company was also unwilling to confess its crimes before; but when the shop assistants first told him that they had exposed more than 20 cases of his illegal acts, he began to confess. When the shop assistants told him for the second time that the exposure materials had reached more than 50 cases, he was so frightened that his face turned ashen, and he further confessed his problems. The shop assistants pursued step by step, and he was forced to confess one by one. In some firms, shop assistants held meetings several times a day to mobilize the capitalists. The capitalists wrote confessions eight or ten times. In some industries, some big merchants, in order to conceal their crimes, united with medium and small merchants to refuse to confess. After fierce attacks by shop assistants and various forces, many medium and small merchants began to speak out about their illegal activities. Their so-called united front began to disintegrate. The big merchants with serious crimes who refused to confess became gradually isolated. The tenacious struggle of the shop assistants will eventually force them to completely disarm.
    How did Tianjin mobilize the broad masses of shop assistants to participate in the struggle? The most important thing is to implement the policy of vigorously and swiftly carrying out a resolute struggle against bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property by the bourgeoisie. Liu Ya, chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Shop Employees' Union, after listening to Mayor Huang Jing's transmission of instructions from higher authorities on January 4, immediately convened a series of ideological mobilization meetings among the main cadres of the trade union, grassroots trade union cadres, and the broad masses of shop assistants. Branches, sub-branches, inspection teams, and inspection groups of the austerity inspection committee were organized in the shop employees' union and its affiliated industries and grassroots trade unions. A strong fighting force was organized with members of the Communist Youth League, labor models, and activists as the core. The main cadres of the shop employees' union went all out, leading teams to fight separately, to achieve full mobilization and unity from top to bottom. These ideological mobilization and organizational preparations were quickly completed within one or two days.
    Since this was a new task and the cadres and the masses had no experience, the leading cadres of the shop employees' union first led everyone to conduct experiments. On the evening of January 6, in coordination with the working committee of the Communist Youth League in District One, they convened a conference including more than 300 shop assistants and more than 100 industrial workers, mobilizing everyone to expose the unlawful acts of capitalists in bribing, evading taxes, and stealing state property. This exposure meeting was very successful. The more than 300 shop assistants who attended alone exposed 460 cases of illegal acts by capitalists. The second trial exposure meeting was also successful. Although the important cases exposed in these two conferences were still few, everyone had seen the great momentum and high enthusiasm of the shop assistants, and understood that this was an effective way to attack unlawful merchants, and also an effective way to raise the class consciousness of the shop assistants. Everyone affirmed the experience of the conference struggle and immediately promoted its implementation throughout the city. A vigorous exposure movement quickly unfolded among shop assistants throughout the city.
    In the struggle against unlawful merchants, the main problems currently encountered by the masses of shop assistants in Tianjin are, on the one hand, the sabotage by unlawful merchants, and on the other hand, the fact that some shop assistants still have ideological concerns and their positions are not firm enough. Some unlawful merchants are very cunning. They use various despicable and shameless means to sabotage the exposure of shop assistants. They use methods of raising wages, and women, to lure shop assistants; use methods of dismissing or reducing shop assistants' welfare to threaten shop assistants; some pretend to be crazy and silly to make trouble when shop assistants hold meetings; others say fiercely: "Whoever exposes me, I will fight him to the death!" Jia Shoushan, manager of the Changji Lumber Firm on Dagu Road in District Six, and Zhao Shaozhen, the deputy manager, two treacherous merchants, even frantically forced the shop assistant Zhang Yuting to death. (The two criminals, Jia and Zhao, have been arrested by the government.)
    On the shop assistant side, most people are brave and resolute in the struggle against unlawful merchants. However, some shop assistants, because they have been deceived and blinded by capitalists for a long time, and because they have certain relatives and friends with the capital side, have vague class consciousness and do not clearly understand the crimes of unlawful merchants harming the country. Some shop assistants still have ideological concerns about exposure, fearing being attacked and retaliated against by the capital side; fearing that the business will close down after the exposure, and they will lose their jobs; some shop assistants have gained some "advantages" in the crimes of unlawful merchants defrauding state property, and therefore have ideological baggage, fearing being implicated.
    Faced with the rampant attacks of unlawful merchants, the shop assistants in Tianjin, with the support of the broad masses of the people and the People's Government, are launching a head-on blow. The Tianjin People's Court has arrested and punished certain treacherous merchants who attacked shop assistants and sabotaged the exposure movement; or ordered them to repent and apologize to the shop assistants, and guarantee not to commit the crimes again. Illegal acts by unlawful merchants of dismissing shop assistants or reducing shop assistants' welfare on the pretext have been severely stopped. The shop employees' union has also called on the broad masses of shop assistants to be highly vigilant and thoroughly expose the conspiracies and tricks of unlawful merchants, so that their tricks cannot be used. For shop assistants who have made certain mistakes due to being driven by treacherous merchants, the shop employees' union calls on them to take the initiative to confess and explain. It is explained that as long as they thoroughly confess and resolutely fight against unlawful merchants, their mistakes should be entirely the responsibility of the treacherous merchants. Regarding the concerns of shop assistants who fear being dismissed by the capital side, the shop employees' union has repeatedly explained to them: The People's Government is responsible for guaranteeing that the shop assistants' existing jobs will not be affected by the exposure.
    In order to further deepen the exposure movement, the Tianjin Shop Employees' Union is now rectifying the ranks of shop assistants ideologically and organizationally while fighting. The ideological education of shop assistants mainly involves educating shop assistants with various examples of crimes committed by unlawful merchants harming the country in the exposure movement, raising shop assistants' patriotic thinking and class consciousness. Model figures and model deeds of shop assistants who resolutely fight against unlawful merchants are commended; for certain shop assistants whose positions are unstable and attitudes are incorrect in the struggle, education is carried out within the trade union, and appropriate criticism and self-criticism are launched. In terms of organizational form and activity methods, the current shift has been from large-scale exposure meetings to decentralized in-depth activities. Each grassroots trade union selects a group of elite soldiers, with grassroots cadres and activists as the backbone, combined with accountants and runners in the shop assistants who are familiar with the business situation, and organizes hundreds of groups to conduct in-depth investigation and research in a planned, purposeful, and focused manner, to find and capture big "tigers".

    天津市店员工人坚决地同不法商人进行阶级斗争
    王治  林沫
    天津全市四万多私营商店的店员（占全部私营商店店员的百分之八十左右）已积极行动起来，走上反行贿、反偷、漏税、反盗窃国家财产、反偷工减料和反盗窃国家经济情报运动的前线，大张旗鼓地对不法商人各种侵害国家和人民利益的罪行展开了斗争。到一月十八日为止，全市店员共举行大小检举会近二百次，会内和会外检举的案件共二万多件。全市店员情绪之高，是已往的群众运动所少有的。在开会时，往往主持会议的人讲话未完，已有成百件的检举材料送上主席台。过去有些行业是工会活动的死角。这次这些行业的店员们也卷进运动中来了。广大店员们提出的口号是：“布好天罗地网，不让不法分子漏掉一个！”“战斗到底，不到胜利不收兵！”“跳进深山，捉大老虎！”
    广大店员的检举运动，迫使不法商人不得不正视自己的罪恶。有些不法商人，原来对这一运动抱着抵抗和应付的态度。但当他们觉察到自己的罪行不能瞒过店员群众的耳目时，就恐慌起来，不得不坦白交代自己的问题。利懋汽车材料行经理在店员的围攻下，交代了自己多次行贿、偷税的行为，并报出账外资金黄金七百四十两。某木行的资方，以前也是不肯坦白自己的罪行的；但当店员第一次告诉他已检举出他的不法行为二十多件时，他就开始坦白了。店员第二次告诉他检举材料已达五十多件时，他吓得面色如土，他又进一步交代了自己的问题。店员一步步追击，他被迫一件件交代。在有些商号里，店员一天数次开会动员资方。资方曾十次、八次地写坦白书。在有些行业里，一些大商人为着隐瞒自己的罪恶，曾联合中、小商户拒不坦白。经过店员和各方面力量的猛烈攻击，很多中、小商户开始讲出了自己的不法行为。他们的所谓联合阵线开始分化。罪恶深重，拒不坦白的大商户逐渐孤立了。店员群众的顽强斗争，最后将迫使他们完全缴械。
    天津市是怎样发动广大店员群众参加斗争的呢？最主要的，是贯彻了大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地和资产阶级行贿、偷税、盗窃国家财产等不法行为进行坚决斗争的方针。中国店员工会天津市委员会刘亚主席在一月四日听了黄敬市长传达了上级的指示后，立即在工会主要干部、基层工会干部和广大店员中召开了一系列的思想动员会议。在店员工会及所属各行业和各基层工会中组织了节约检查委员会的支会、支分会、检查队和检查组。以青年团员、劳动模范、积极分子为核心，组织了一支强大的战斗队伍。店员工会的主要干部则全力以赴，分别带队作战，作到全体动员，上下一气。这些思想动员和组织准备工作，是在一两天之内迅速完成的。
    由于这是一个新的工作，干部和群众都还没有经验，店员工会的领导干部曾首先带领大家进行实验。一月六日晚上，他们和一区青年团工作委员会配合起来，召开了包括三百多店员和一百多产业工人的大会，动员大家检举资本家行贿、偷税、盗窃国家财产的不法行为。这次检举大会开得很成功，单是到会的三百多店员，就检举了资本家的不法行为四百六十件。第二次试行召开的检举会，同样获得了成功。虽然这两次大会中所检举的重要案件还很少，但大家已经看到了店员们声势的浩大和情绪的高涨，理解到这是向不法商人进攻的有效办法，同时也是提高店员阶级觉悟的有效办法。大家肯定了大会斗争的经验，并立即在全市推广实行。轰轰烈烈的检举运动，便迅速在全市店员中展开了。
    天津市店员群众在和不法商人进行斗争中，目前所遇到的主要问题，一方面是不法商人的破坏，一方面是部分店员还存在着思想顾虑，立场不够坚定。有些不法商人是十分狡猾的。他们用种种卑鄙无耻的手段对店员的检举进行破坏。他们用提高工资的办法，用女人，来引诱店员；用解雇或减少店员福利的办法来威胁店员；有的在店员开会时，装疯卖傻地去捣乱；有的则凶恶地说：“谁检举我，我就和他拚命！”六区大沽路长记木行经理贾寿山、副经理赵绍珍两个奸商，甚至丧心病狂地逼死店员张玉亭。（贾、赵两犯已被政府逮捕）
    在店员方面，大部分人对不法商人的斗争是勇敢和坚决的。但也有些店员因为长期受资本家的欺骗和蒙蔽，因为和资方有着某些亲戚朋友关系，因而阶级意识模糊，对不法商人为害国家的罪恶认识不清。有些店员对检举还有思想顾虑，怕遭到资方的打击和报复；怕检举以后生意关门，自己失业；有些店员曾在不法商人诈骗国家财产的罪行中沾过一些“便宜”因而思想上背了包袱，怕自己受连累。
    对不法商人的猖狂进攻，天津市的店员在广大人民和人民政府的支持下，正在进行迎头痛击。对某些打击店员、破坏检举运动的奸商，天津市人民法院已将其逮捕惩办；或令其向店员悔过道歉，保证不再犯。不法商人借故解雇店员或减少店员福利的不法行为，已受到严厉制止。店员工会并号召广大店员高度警惕和彻底揭露不法商人的阴谋诡计，使其伎俩无从施展。对于因受奸商驱使而犯过某些错误的店员，店员工会号召他们主动坦白、交代。说明只要自己彻底坦白，并坚决向不法商人进行斗争，说明他们的错误应完全由奸商来负责。对店员怕被资方解雇的顾虑，店员工会一再向他们说明：人民政府负责保证店员现有的职业不因检举而受影响。
    天津市店员工会为进一步深入开展检举运动，现正一面战斗，一面从思想上和组织上整顿店员的队伍。对店员的思想教育，主要是在检举运动中，以不法商人为害国家的各种罪恶事例来教育店员，提高店员的爱国思想和阶级觉悟。对于店员中坚决和不法商人进行斗争的模范人物和模范事迹，进行表扬；对某些店员在斗争中立场不稳和态度不正确的现象，则在工会内部进行教育，并展开适当的批评和自我批评。在组织形式和活动方式上，现在已由大会检举转为分散的深入活动。各基层工会选择一部精兵，以基层干部和积极分子作骨干，结合店员中熟悉业务情况的会计和跑外人员，组织成数百个小组，有计划、有目的、有重点地深入调查研究，寻找和捉拿大“老虎”。
