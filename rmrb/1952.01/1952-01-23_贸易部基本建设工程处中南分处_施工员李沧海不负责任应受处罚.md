    Central-South Branch of the Capital Construction Engineering Department of the Ministry of Trade
    Construction Technician Li Canghai Should Be Punished for Irresponsibility

    To the Editor: Li Canghai, a construction technician at the Central-South Branch of the Capital Construction Engineering Department of the Ministry of Trade, is irresponsible in his work and has caused great losses to the state. The Luoyang Grain Company warehouse project was contracted to the state-owned Zhengzhou Construction Company. The Central-South Branch sent Li Canghai to lead the construction. Li Canghai's lifestyle is corrupt, and he does not pay attention to the construction work at all, which has damaged the project. For example, when building the cement floor of the granary, he neither supervised the work nor inspected it. The cement floor was originally specified to be ten centimeters thick, but it was built to be only seven or eight centimeters thick, thus weakening the load-bearing capacity. When building the wall, he asked the workers to dig the high terrain into ditches and then build the wall. As a result, the wall was built too low and completely lost its function. He even arbitrarily modified the drawings without asking for instructions from his superiors beforehand or reporting afterwards. As a result, many places had to be reworked after the project was completed. Taking only the cement floor of two warehouses as an example, 60 tons of cement are needed, worth 39 million yuan; in addition, it would cost more than 200 million yuan to raise the wall. We suggest that the relevant authorities handle this matter promptly.

    Editor's note: According to a letter from the Central-South Branch of the Capital Construction Engineering Department of the Ministry of Trade, Li Canghai has been sent to the People's Court for legal processing.

    贸易部基本建设工程处中南分处
    施工员李沧海不负责任应受处罚
    编辑同志：中央贸易部基本建设工程处中南分处施工员李沧海，对工作不负责任，给国家造成很大损失。洛阳粮食公司仓库工程，是公营郑州建筑公司承建的。中南分处派李沧海领导施工。李沧海平时生活腐化，对施工工作毫不重视，致使工程受到损害。比如：在建筑粮仓洋灰地坪时，他既不监工，又不检查。洋灰地坪原规定十公分厚，竟被修成七公分、八公分不等，因而减弱了载重力。砌围墙时，他要工人把高地形部分挖成沟，然后砌墙，结果因围墙砌得太低，完全失掉了作用。他甚至擅自修改图样，事前既不向上级请示，事后也不作报告。这样，在工程完工后，许多地方必须返工重做。只拿两栋仓库的洋灰地坪计算，就需用洋灰六十吨，价值三千九百万元；另外若把围墙加高，约需二亿多元。我们建议有关机关迅速处理这件事。
