    The industrial and commercial sectors must resolutely fight against bribery, tax evasion, and the fraudulent seizure of state property
    (Summary of a report at the mobilization meeting of the Tianjin Industrial and Commercial Federation's Thrift Inspection Branch)
    Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Tianjin Industrial and Commercial Federation

    Currently, a nationwide "Three-Anti" movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is being vigorously launched in various regions. I hope that our industrial and commercial sectors will also participate in this movement, and be able to voluntarily confess, expose, and report acts of bribery, tax evasion, and fraudulent seizure of state property.

    Not long after the start of this movement, I heard that some friends in the industrial and commercial sectors have different views on the significance of this movement. Some people think that the "Three-Anti" movement is only being carried out among cadres in government agencies and enterprises. Those of us engaged in industry and commerce cannot embezzle from others, nor do we waste state property, and we are not bureaucrats, so this movement has nothing to do with us. Others say that corruption is something done by some cadres in agencies and enterprises, and they should be punished. However, industrialists and businessmen are forced to socialize and have no choice but to oblige. Why should industrialists and businessmen be punished when they are the ones spending the money? Still others, although they know that a certain industrialist or businessman has offered a bribe, or that a certain cadre has accepted a bribe, they think it's none of their business, why should they report them and offend people without any benefit to themselves? Some people have offered bribes themselves, but are afraid to confess because they don't want to lose face and have to pay compensation and be punished. If they don't confess, they are afraid that the bribe-takers will confess and they will be subject to even heavier punishment for being reported. Therefore, they are hesitant and uneasy. In addition, some people believe that all the measures of the People's Government after liberation are very good, and they never expected that these corruption incidents would occur in this short period of more than two years, so they have doubts about the future of New China.

    Are the above views and understandings correct? I can say with certainty that they are all incorrect and wrong. Because, in my personal experience, the formation of corrupt practices is indeed due to the influence of the Kuomintang reactionary style on some cadres, or the emergence of pride, complacency, and selfish individualism in some old cadres after the victory of the revolution, leading them to the path of corruption. However, the main reason is that they are lured by the backward side of the bourgeoisie, the disregard for the interests of the entire people, the pursuit of profit, and the despicable style of selfishness and self-interest. This is a responsibility that our industrialists and businessmen cannot shirk. As Mayor Huang Jing pointed out in his report: "Judging from various materials on bribery and corruption, most of the people who bribe revolutionary workers, except for a small number of counter-revolutionaries and other lawless elements, are from the industrial and commercial sectors. As for the working people offering bribes, there are none, which is enough to fully explain the problem." In particular, the scope of corruption is not limited to bribery alone. Any act of defrauding state property by illegal means for self-enrichment, or harming the interests of the people in pursuit of illegal profits, should be regarded as corruption. For example, a certain trader, through bribery, steals state secrets, and hoards goods that are about to rise in price for high-price sales; or rushes to sell goods that are about to fall in price, only caring about his personal illegal interests, and seriously harming the interests of the people. Another example is that some industrial and commercial households set up separate accounts, conceal their turnover, or falsely report as merchants in their own business, or use various methods to deceive the government and evade taxes. Furthermore, when undertaking processing orders from various government departments, they falsely report costs, replace good materials with substandard materials, and replace good goods with substandard goods that do not meet specifications, causing losses to the people's property. The cases of Qiao Mingxun and others who undertook the manufacture of military raincoats and falsely reported costs to deceive the government, the case of Ren Haiqi and others in the North China Liaison Office of Shanghai manufacturers who evaded huge amounts of taxes and sold machines of inferior quality to state-owned and public-owned enterprises, causing serious damage to state property, and the recent incident of Yuanda Stationery Industrial Cooperative using the illegal means of falsely calculating costs and using substandard materials to replace good materials in the process of the department store exclusively selling the factory's carbon paper for three months, defrauding state property of more than 100 million yuan, all belong to corrupt behavior. To put it on a smaller scale, in order to try to build relationships with cadres, do some improper transactions, or curry favor with cadres in the hope of getting special care, frequently inviting cadres to dinner, dancing, and watching shows, and then giving them daily necessities, such as watches, fountain pens, and other items, and further bribing and corrupting them, isn't this something that should be opposed? Therefore, the anti-corruption movement is not only closely related to our industrial and commercial sectors, but also requires us to raise our awareness and conduct in-depth reviews.

    As for why bribery and acceptance of bribes should be treated the same way, it is because the person who offers a bribe must have an intention. This intention is to steal state property as an illegal gain for self-enrichment. For example, a person who undertakes civil engineering projects bribes the person who supervises and inspects materials in order to cut corners and use inferior materials; a person who sells goods bribes the person who receives the goods in order to pass off inferior goods as good goods, and exempt the short weight from being made up. At the very least, the purpose is also to build relationships and seek undue care. There is absolutely no case of someone offering a bribe to a certain cadre without any intention. Therefore, although the person who offers a bribe takes out a part of the money as a bribe, the state property that he steals from these bribes is many times greater than the money used for the bribe, and because this behavior induces cadres to go down the path of corruption, the person who offers the bribe should be treated the same as the person who accepts the bribe.

    As for failing to report a crime when knowing about it, it is also a serious and wrong attitude of being irresponsible to the people and the country. Because our national bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois industrialists and businessmen are one of the masters of our People's Republic of China. In order to make our motherland prosperous and strong, we must, under the leadership of the working class, establish the attitude of being masters of our own affairs, and thoroughly eliminate these toxins and germs that corrode and harm the people's regime, so as to further consolidate the people's regime. We must bravely and ruthlessly fight against these corrupt phenomena. Moreover, reporting corruption is also saving the corrupt person from falling further. Only in this way can we be worthy of being an industrialist and businessman in a new society.

    Regarding the confession of those who offer bribes and are corrupt, I think they should confess sincerely without any hesitation. Because our industrialists and businessmen have all been influenced by the old society for a long time, no matter who it is, they all have more or less bad habits left over from the old society. Before our ideological transformation has been able to achieve greater success, some people will inevitably inherit the old days' set of selfish, self-interested, speculative, opportunistic, deceptive, and obfuscating despicable styles. Before this "Three-Anti" movement was launched, we did not know how this style harmed the consolidation and development of the people's regime. Now that we all understand the serious corrosiveness of this behavior, and the people and the government are giving us the opportunity to confess, we should quickly throw away this heavy burden, and bravely and sincerely confess ourselves, without any more fluke mentality. Because even if you are temporarily spared from being reported, you will always carry this heavy burden on your spirit, and you will not be able to get any time of relaxation and pleasure. What a painful thing that would be. Moreover, since you have offered a bribe, or evaded taxes, or engaged in cutting corners and deceiving, that is a two-sided affair. Can you guarantee that the bribe-taker will not confess? Can you guarantee that the tax bureau will never investigate it? Can you guarantee that cutting corners will never be discovered? By that time, you will regret it too late.

    Next, let's talk about the issue of opposing extravagance and waste, which in the industrial and commercial sectors is inseparable from the movement to increase production and practice thrift. As everyone knows, we need to continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to support the front lines. At the same time, we must also stabilize the economic order in the rear, and we must also focus on carrying out our national construction. All these tasks require a lot of money. We cannot, like the past reactionary regime, abuse foreign debts, nor can we abuse the issuance of banknotes to harm the interests of the entire people. There is only one way to increase production, practice thrift, and accumulate national wealth to complete these tasks. Our industrial and commercial sectors have serious waste in terms of stockpiled funds and the use of raw materials. We must learn from the advanced experience of state-owned and public-owned enterprises, improve production and operation, implement a democratic management system, rely on workers, rely on the masses, and be careful in calculations, and gradually move towards a scientific and planned economic accounting system. Through this anti-waste movement that combines increasing production and practicing thrift, we can improve quality, reduce costs, and improve our own business methods. This time, I heard Mayor Huang Jing's report at the Third Session of the Third Tianjin People's Congress, and learned that state-owned and public-owned enterprises plan to increase production by 5 trillion yuan in 1952. If our private enterprises can do a good job in planning to increase production and practice thrift, I believe that the number of increased production will be much larger than 5 trillion yuan.

    As for the movement against bureaucracy, in the view of general industrialists and businessmen, it has little to do with us, and they do not pay much attention to this work. But if we think about it carefully, do people in our industrial and commercial sectors really not have a bureaucratic style? No, not only do they have it, but it is also widespread. Because the term bureaucracy is not exclusively for working cadres. All careless, sloppy, irresponsible, and casual work attitudes, and the lack of precision, organization, and discipline in work are bureaucratic styles. The existence of this style, on a small scale, can hinder personal progress, and on a large scale, it is the root cause of fostering and breeding corruption and waste. To be an industrialist and businessman in a new society, we should first examine ourselves and completely overcome these bureaucratic styles, and establish a new style of being responsible to the people and serving the people.

    Today, I make a request to private industrialists and businessmen in the city, that we should clearly recognize ideologically that corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are seriously harming the interests of the entire people and corroding our people's regime. Because the interests of the country and the overall interests of the entire people are developed, our personal interests can be obtained. Therefore, we must implement the government's call for the "Three-Anti" movement and resolutely fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Those of us who have had incidents of corruption and self-enrichment, whether it is bribery, currying favor, seeking favors, or evading taxes, or cutting corners and calculating costs at a high rate, or even the corrupt behavior of the operators or employees of our private enterprises themselves, such as kickbacks for purchasing materials, etc., should dispel all concerns and immediately boldly expose them and confess to the organization or the administration. If you do not take this opportunity to get rid of these burdens, it will weigh you down forever. Moreover, being able to voluntarily confess and expose is a concrete manifestation of your understanding of the ideological and identifying the evil behavior of corruption, and it is also a manifestation of progress. Everyone will not only not despise you, but on the contrary, they will respect progressive people who are brave enough to confess and repent. If you confess simply to get rid of responsibility and reduce punishment, but not to dig out the bad root of corruption from your mind, then the problem will still not be solved. After this "Three-Anti" movement ends, it will slowly grow out again and cause trouble when it has the opportunity.

    Comrades, we want to be a new industrialist and businessman in a new society, and we must establish a new style and new business ethics. If we do not want to be a backward person of the times, there is no reason to retain the bad ideas left over from the old society. Not only do we have to completely confess these past shameful records, but we also have to strengthen our ideological transformation, fundamentally wash away these stains, and start anew. Therefore, when we launch the "Three-Anti" movement, the first stage is to seriously go through learning, understand the spirit of this movement ideologically, thoroughly recognize the importance and necessity of the "Three-Anti" movement, and then carry out confession and reporting. If we do not do this, it will be impossible to completely eradicate the bad root of corruption in the minds of our industrialists and businessmen.

### 工商界必须向行贿、漏税、诈骗国家资财的行为作坚决斗争

    工商界必须向行贿、漏税、诈骗国家资财的行为作坚决斗争
    （在天津市工商联节约检查分会动员大会上的报告摘要）
    天津市工商联主任委员  李烛尘
    现在全国各地正在大张旗鼓地展开反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的“三反”运动，希望我们工商界也来一道参加这一运动，能够自动坦白揭发和检举行贿、漏税、诈骗国家资财的行为。
    在这一运动展开不久，我听到一些工商界的朋友们对这一运动的意义，有着不同的看法。有的人认为“三反”运动只是在政府机关和企业部门干部中进行，我们搞工商业的人，既没法向人贪污，也没有浪费国家资财，更不是官僚，这一运动与我无干；也有的人说贪污是机关企业中部分干部干的事，应该惩罚他们，但是工商业者是被迫的，不得不应酬，为什么工商业者出了钱还治罪？还有的人虽然知道某一个工商业者行过贿，或是某一个干部受过贿，但是事不干己，何必检举他们，得罪了人自己也落不着好处；也有的人自己行过贿，但是怕坦白出来，扫了自己的面子，还要追赔损失受到处分；不坦白吧，又怕受贿人坦白出来，自己因被检举而受到更重的处分，因此举棋不定，忐忑不安。此外还有的人认为解放后人民政府的一切措施都是很好的，想不到这短短的两年多过程中，会有这些贪污事件，因此对新中国的前途发生了怀疑。
    以上这些看法和认识是不是正确呢？我肯定地说，都是不正确的，都是错误的。因为就我个人体会到的来讲，贪污腐化行为的形成，固然因为有一部分干部受了国民党反动作风的影响，或是一部分老干部在革命胜利后，产生了骄傲自满贪图享受的个人主义思想，从而走上贪污腐化的道路，但是主要的还是受了资产阶级落后一面的、不顾全体人民利益、唯利是图、自私自利的卑劣作风所引诱，这一点是我们工商业者不能推卸责任的，这在黄敬市长的报告中已经指出：“从各种贪污受贿的材料来看，对革命工作人员行贿的人，除一小部分是反革命和其他不法分子以外，其中绝大部分是工商界的人。至于劳动人民来行贿的却一个也没有，这就足以充分说明了这个问题。”尤其贪污的范围，并不是仅仅指着行贿受贿来说，凡是以不法手段诈取国家财物以自肥，或为追求非法利润而损害了人民利益的行为，都应该视为贪污。例如某贸易商通过了行贿，窃取国家机密，把将要涨价的货物抢购囤积起来高价出售；把将要落价的货物抢先甩卖出去，只顾他个人的非法利益，而严重地损害了人民利益；又如一些工商业户另立后账，隐瞒营业额，或以自己营业假报行商，或以多种多样的方法蒙蔽政府偷漏税款；再如承做政府各部门加工定货，虚报成本，以次料换好料，以不合规格的次货顶替好货，使人民的财产受到损失；像大家都知道的乔铭勋等承做军用雨衣谎报成本欺骗政府的案件，上海厂商华北联合办事处任海岐等偷漏巨额税款，并以品质低劣的机器售给国营、公营企业，使国家财产受到严重损失的案件，以及最近远大文具工业社在百货公司包销该厂出品复写纸三个月的过程中，用高算成本以次料顶好料的不法手段，骗取国家资财一亿余元的事件，这都是属于贪污行为的。再往小里说，为了企图和干部拉拢关系，多做些不正当的交易，或是向干部买好，希望加以特别照顾，时常的对干部请吃饭、请跳舞、请看戏，再进一步就送些日用品，如同手表、自来水笔以及其他用品，更进一步就会行贿贪污，难道这不就是应该反对的？所以说反对贪污腐化运动，不但和我们工商界有着密切关系，并且正需要我们提高认识，深入检讨的一件大事。
    至于行贿和受贿的为什么要同样处理呢？这是因为行贿的人一定是有企图的，这个企图就是要窃取国家资财作为自肥的不法利得。譬如承做土木工程的人，向监工验料的人行贿，是为了偷工减料；承卖货物的人向收货的人行贿，是为了拿次货充好货，短斤的免追补；至轻微的目的，也是要借以拉拢关系，求取不应得的照顾，绝对没有不为丝毫企图，而向某一个干部行贿的。所以行贿的人虽然拿出一部分钱作为贿赂，但是他由这些贿赂而窃取到的国家资财，不知道要比行贿所用的钱大多少倍，并且因为他这种行为引诱了干部走向贪污腐化的道路，所以行贿的人应该和受贿的人同样处理。
    至于知情不举，也正是一种对人民对国家不负责的严重错误态度。因为我们民族资产阶级和小资产阶级的工商业者，正是我们中华人民共和国主人翁之一，为了我们祖国的富强壮大，我们必须在工人阶级领导下，树立起主人翁的态度，把这些腐蚀损害人民政权的毒素病菌彻底清除，使人民政权进一步巩固起来。我们要勇敢地无情地向这些贪污现象作斗争。况且检举贪污，也是挽救贪污者使他不再堕落下去，能这样，才能称得起一个新社会的工商业者。
    还有关于行贿贪污者的坦白问题，我认为应该毫无顾虑地真诚坦白出来。因为我们工商业者都是从旧社会里受了长期薰染过来的人，无论是谁，都或多或少的存在着旧社会遗留下来的不良习惯，在我们思想改造还没有能够得到更大的成就以前，就免不了有人还因袭着旧日的自私自利投机取巧欺骗蒙蔽的一套恶劣作风。在这“三反”运动还没有展开以前，我们还不知道这种作风如何地危害着人民政权的巩固和发展，现在既然已经都明白了这种行为的严重腐蚀性，并且人民和政府还给我们以坦白的机会，我们就应该赶快地丢掉这一个沉重的包袱，勇敢地、真诚地、自行坦白出来，不要再存侥幸的心理。因为即使你暂时幸免被检举，你在精神上会永远背着这个沉重的包袱，而得不到一些轻松愉快的时间，那将是如何苦恼的一件事。况且你既然行过贿，或是偷漏过税款，或是作过偷工减料蒙蔽欺骗的事，那就是双方面的事，你能保证受贿人不坦白出来吗？你能保证税务局永远调查不出吗？你能保证偷工减料永不被发觉吗？到那时候，你将要追悔莫及了。
    其次谈到反对铺张浪费的问题，这在工商界来说是和增产节约运动分不开的。大家都知道，我们需要继续加强抗美援朝的工作，来支援前线，同时我们也要稳定后方的经济秩序，并且还要重点地进行我们的国家建设，所有这几方面的工作，都需要很多的钱。我们既不能像过去的反动政权滥借外债，也不能滥发钞票损害全体人民的利益，只有增加生产厉行节约，积累国家财富来完成这几项任务的一条道路。我们工商界在积压资金使用原材料方面有着严重的浪费现象，我们必须吸取国营、公营企业的先进经验，改善生产经营，实行民主管理制度，依靠工人、依靠群众，并且要精打细算，逐渐走向科学的有计划的经济核算制，通过这一结合增产节约的反浪费运动，来提高质量，降低成本，并改善自己的经营方式。这次听到黄敬市长在三届三次各界人民代表会议的报告，知道国营、公营企业在一九五二年度计划增产达五万亿元，我们私营企业若是能够把增产节约计划搞好，我相信增产的数字一定会比五万亿元还要大得多。
    至于反对官僚主义运动，在一般工商业者来看，都认为和我们没有多大关系，不大重视这一工作。但是我们仔细想一想，我们工商界人士真的没有官僚主义作风吗？不是的，不但有而且普遍地存在着。因为官僚主义这个名词不是专对工作干部说的，凡是一切麻痹大意，粗枝大叶，不负责任，随随便便的工作态度，和在工作上没有精确性、组织性、纪律性的表现，都是官僚主义作风。这种作风的存在，往小里说，是能阻碍个人的进步，往大里说，它就是助长滋生贪污浪费行为的根源。我们要作一个新社会的工商业者，我们应该首先检讨自己，把这些官僚主义作风完全克服掉，树立起对人民负责，为人民服务的新作风。
    我今天向全市私营工商业者提出一个要求，就是我们应该从思想上明确认识贪污浪费和官僚主义正在严重地危害着全体人民利益，腐蚀着我们的人民政权。因为国家的利益和全体人民整个的利益得到发展，我们的个人利益才能获得，所以我们必须贯彻政府“三反”运动的号召，向贪污浪费和官僚主义作坚决的斗争。我们有过贪污自肥事件的人，不论是行贿、买好、求顺或是偷漏税款，或是偷工减料高算成本，甚至于我们私营企业本身的经营者或从业员的贪污行为，如购料要回扣等陋规，都应该解除一切顾虑，马上大胆地暴露出来，向组织上或行政上坦白，倘若不趁这个机会把我们这些包袱丢掉，它将会压得你永远抬不起头来。况且能够自动的自行坦白暴露，正是你搞通思想认清贪污这个罪恶行为的一种具体表现，也正是一种进步的表现，大家不但不会轻视你，相反地对于这样勇于坦白悔过的进步人士一定还会加以尊重的。假使你进行坦白，单纯是为了解脱责任，减轻处分，而不是从思想上把这一个贪污的坏根挖出来的话，那仍然是解决不了问题，在这个“三反”运动结束之后，一定会慢慢地又滋长出来，碰到机会又要去作怪。
    同志们，我们要在新社会里作一个新的工商业者，就要树立起新的作风和新的商业道德，我们若是不愿意作一个时代落伍者，就没有任何理由再把旧社会遗留下来的恶劣思想保留下去。我们不但要把这些过去的无耻的纪录完全坦白出来，我们还要加强我们的思想改造，从基本上把我们这些污点洗清，从新做人。所以我们在展开“三反”运动的时候，第一个阶段就要认真地经过学习，从思想上体会出这一个运动的精神，彻底认清“三反”运动的重要性和必要性，然后再进行坦白检举，不这样做的话就不可能在我们工商业者的思想上把这一个贪污的坏根挖干净。
