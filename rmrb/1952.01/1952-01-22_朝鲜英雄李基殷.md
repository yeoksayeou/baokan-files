    Korean Hero Li Ji-yin
    On August 3, 1950, the Korean People's Army crossed the Nakdong River and continued to pursue the enemy. Li Ji-yin, the deputy company commander of a certain unit, led the soldiers of the First Company through Waegwan along the Class 3 highway towards Daegu. The First Company quickly occupied the enemy's artillery position on the left side of the highway. At this time, the First Company and their entire regiment were in an environment surrounded by enemies on three sides. Suddenly, two enemy tanks came from the right side of the highway, but the entire regiment had only one grenade left, and this grenade was handed over to Li Ji-yin, tasking him with attacking the tanks. Li Ji-yin had destroyed two tanks with a platoon leader in a certain battle in Yeongdong. This time, Li Ji-yin accepted another important mission. He calmly lay in ambush by the highway, waiting for the first enemy tank to drive up to him and stop to fire blindly. Li Ji-yin jumped onto the tank, opened the hatch, and threw the grenade inside. With the sound of the grenade, thick smoke came out of the tank. Li Ji-yin immediately used the anti-aircraft machine gun on the tank to kill the enemy driver in the tank behind, and that tank was also captured. Li Ji-yin's selfless heroic behavior inspired his comrades, making them bravely use automatic rifles to destroy two enemy tanks (one of which was destroyed by the Second Company). Li Ji-yin and his company of soldiers fought heroically in an extremely difficult and dangerous environment, defending their regimental flag—the honor of the entire regiment. The First Company led by Li Ji-yin killed or wounded a total of 300 enemies, captured 225 enemies, and destroyed 5 tanks in the war. Li Ji-yin was awarded the title of "Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" for his special achievements. On August 12, 1951, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea awarded him the First Class National Flag Medal. (Attached picture)

    朝鲜英雄李基殷
    一九五零年八月三日，朝鲜人民军渡过洛东江，继续追击敌人。某部副连长李基殷带领着第一连战士们经过倭馆沿公路的三等公路向大邱推进。第一连迅速地占领了公路左侧敌人的炮兵阵地。这时，第一连和他们的全团却处于三面受敌的环境中。忽然，从公路右侧又开来了两辆敌人的坦克，但是全团却只剩下一个手榴弹了，这个手榴弹又交给了李基殷，让他完成袭击坦克的任务。李基殷曾经在永同的某次战斗中，他和一排长击毁过两辆坦克。这次李基殷又接受了一个严重的任务，他沉着地伏在公路旁，等敌人的第一辆坦克开到他跟前停下来盲目射击时，李基殷纵身跳到坦克上，拉开坦克的盖子，把手榴弹扔了进去，随着手榴弹的响声，坦克里冒出了浓烟。李基殷又立刻利用坦克上的高射机枪，打死了后面那辆坦克上的敌人驾驶员，那辆坦克也做了俘虏。李基殷的奋不顾身的英雄行为，鼓舞了他的战友们，使他们也勇敢地运用自动步枪打毁了两辆敌人的坦克（其中一辆为二连击毁）。李基殷和他全连战士们，在万分艰苦和危险的环境中英勇地战斗，保卫了他们的团旗——全团的荣誉。李基殷率领的第一连，在战争中一共杀伤敌人三百名，俘虏敌人二百二十五名，击毁坦克五辆。李基殷由于建立了特殊的功勋，荣获“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄”的称号。一九五一年八月十二日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会又授给他一级国旗勋章。（附图片）
