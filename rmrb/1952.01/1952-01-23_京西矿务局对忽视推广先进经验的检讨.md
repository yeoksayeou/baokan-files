    京西矿务局对忽视推广先进经验的检讨
    Editor: The People's Daily criticized our bureau on December 29th of last year for neglecting the promotion of safe production experience; we believe this criticism is completely correct. The reason we made such a mistake is primarily because we ideologically neglected the promotion of advanced experience. We did not profoundly understand that discovering, studying, summarizing, and promoting the advanced experience of the masses is an important method for relying on the working class, increasing labor productivity, and leveraging the potential capabilities of enterprises. Therefore, regarding the important experience of the Li Shuhe class in not having any casualties for twenty-one months, we only allowed the trade union to make three summaries, and the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League only made general appeals, without seriously promoting it. A few cadres believed that these experiences were only trivial matters, and we did not promptly correct these erroneous thoughts. Secondly, in terms of work methods, we have a relatively serious bureaucratic style. We limited ourselves to general leadership of the work in the mines, but did not master production technology or familiarize ourselves with the production situation. We also did not do a good job of cultivating exemplary cases. In addition, because the mining bureau had made some progress in safe production over the past year, the leading cadres were somewhat complacent, which is also a major factor in the continued severity of industrial accidents in the mines. Now, we are mobilizing the masses, combined with a major safety inspection, to summarize and promote safe production experience, and resolutely correct errors in our work.

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    京西矿务局对忽视推广先进经验的检讨
    编辑同志：去年十二月二十九日，人民日报对我局忽视推广安全生产经验的事情，提出了批评；我们认为这种批评是完全正确的。我们所以发生这样的错误，首先是因为在思想上忽视推广先进经验。我们没有深刻了解：发现、研究、总结和推广群众的先进经验，是依靠工人阶级，提高劳动生产率。发挥企业潜在能力的重要办法。因此，我们对李书和班二十一个月没有发生伤亡事故的重要经验，只让工会作了三次总结，党、行政、工会、青年团，只做了一般号召，并没有认真地加以推广。少数干部认为这些经验只是平凡小事，我们也没有及时纠正错误思想。其次，在工作方法上，我们有比较严重的事务主义作风。我们对矿厂工作，只限于一般的领导，但没有精通生产技术，熟习生产情况。我们也没有很好地去培养典型。另外，由于一年来矿务局在安全生产上有些进步，所以领导干部多少有些麻痹思想，这也是各矿工伤事故依然严重的主要因素。现在，我们正发动群众，结合保安大检查，总结和推广安全生产经验，坚决纠正工作中的错误。
