Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th: At the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on the 17th, the other party continued to use the excuse of maintaining military balance to request scrutiny of airport facilities within Korea, attempting to interfere in our internal affairs. Our representative pointed out that the other party's so-called argument of maintaining military balance is actually an attempt to maintain a state of war and tension in Korea for a long period. Our consistent position is to eliminate the state of war and to achieve a complete and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue quickly, and we have never agreed to this absurd claim of the other party. The only thing that both parties have agreed to is that in order to ensure the stability of the military armistice, neither side should introduce reinforcing military forces from outside Korea, and there is no other agreement. Since both parties have agreed not to introduce reinforcing military forces, including combat aircraft, from outside Korea during the armistice, it is fundamentally inconceivable that there would be any change in the air force strength of both sides in Korea if the other party is willing to make this guarantee in good faith like us. The basic constituent factor of air force strength is obviously combat aircraft. If the number of combat aircraft does not increase, it is impossible for air force strength to change. In terms of air force strength, this completely guarantees the stability of the military armistice. As for our handling of various facilities within Korea, including airport facilities, this is entirely a matter of internal affairs, and we will never allow any party to interfere in any way or with any excuse. This is our unwavering position.

At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, regarding the serious incident of bombing the Jiangdong prisoner of war camp on the night of the 14th, which resulted in more than 70 casualties among the other party's captured personnel, the other party shamelessly put forward excuses such as "the prisoner of war camp should have clear markings," "the prisoner of war camp should not be located in an area within range of artillery fire," and "the precise location of the prisoner of war camp should be notified in advance," attempting to evade responsibility. Our representative sternly pointed out: "It is your side that has been violating all international laws and all war regulations, carrying out indiscriminate bombing of peaceful towns and innocent residents day and night. Your boasted air force regards every area and every house inhabited by the Korean people as your military target. No matter how clear the markings are, your air force indiscriminately bombed schools, churches, hospitals, and even prisoner of war camps holding your own captured personnel. In your indiscriminate bombing, the soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army even sacrificed their own lives to rescue your captured personnel. What qualifications do you have, and what reason do you have to say that the responsibility for this serious incident lies with us?"

The other party had no words to answer under the just and forceful questioning of our representative. For two days, the other party introduced two representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross into the conference area without our consent, and requested, through the other party's military police officers, to meet with General Li Xiangchao, our chief representative of the subcommittee on the fourth agenda item. Our military police officer was ordered on the 17th to notify the other party's military police officer that our commander had made it clear in his letter to General Ridgway on December 24, 1951, regarding the matter of the Red Cross societies of both sides assisting in the repatriation of prisoners of war after the signing and entry into force of the armistice agreement. Currently, we believe that there is no need, and we are not prepared to meet with the representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Our military police officer also pointed out to the other party that, according to the agreement between the two sides, only the delegations and personnel of the delegations of both sides are allowed to enter and exit the conference area freely, but for the past two days, the other party has introduced the representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross into the conference area twice without seeking our consent, which is inconsistent with the agreement. Therefore, we request the other party to pay serious attention to this so that similar incidents will not occur in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: At the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on the 16th, our representative once again pointed out: "Our proposal of January 9th suggests that both parties guarantee not to introduce any reinforcing military forces from outside Korea during the armistice, and clearly stipulates that no combat aircraft shall be introduced. If your side is willing to make this guarantee in good faith like us, it is impossible to imagine that there will be any increase in the air force strength of both sides in Korea. You have no reason to use the excuse of not increasing air force strength to demand restrictions on airport facilities within Korea, attempting to interfere in our internal affairs. You also say that as long as Korea has airfields, our side can destroy the agreement at any time and transport aircraft from outside Korea to increase air force strength. What basis do you have for slandering our side for harboring the intention of destroying a possible agreement during the armistice period while negotiating? What basis do you have for accusing our side of not complying with the agreement reached during the negotiations? On the contrary, it is your side that should be accused. If you are willing to continue the negotiations, you should not make such absurd slanders again, because in doing so, you are negating the basis for both sides to conduct negotiations."

At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, the other party still failed to answer the questions raised by our side for several days and sophistically claimed that the suggestion in the other party's proposal to require our side to exchange displaced civilians with our captured personnel on a one-to-one basis was only for "the effective use of transportation tools by both sides." Our representative sternly pointed out: "Your side has repeatedly denied that you are attempting to use prisoners of war as hostages, but Article 2 of your proposal clearly stipulates that our side is required to exchange civilians for an equal number of our captured personnel. When your side put forward this proposal, our side asked your side to explain the meaning of the provisions of Article 2. You once said in this tent that your side's request for the repatriation of civilians guarantees this. Is this not using our captured personnel as hostages? But today, you have changed your tune again, saying that it is not an exchange of civilians for prisoners of war, but that the repatriation of civilians and prisoners of war is carried out simultaneously, which is an effective use of transportation tools. You have forgotten the provisions in your proposal, and you have forgotten your own explanation. Your side has announced a larger number of prisoners of war, so you want to extort with a larger quantity, but you should know that prisoners of war in war, no matter how large or small the quantity, can never be used as extortion capital, and are even less allowed to serve as hostages. We will resolutely oppose your side's proposal to use prisoners of war as hostages, attempting to detain prisoners of war and send them to the mortal enemies of the Korean and Chinese people."

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th: Our correspondent reports: On the 17th, US aircraft once again violated the agreement and bombed the Kaesong Neutral Zone. At 9:35 AM, two US aircraft invaded the Kaesong area and circled at low altitude. At 9:40 AM, another US aircraft invaded the airspace over the Kaesong area and dropped a bomb in Lijiling Shejidung within the three-mile zone. The bomb landed on the hillside about 200 meters south of the village and exploded immediately. Shrapnel flew more than 100 meters away, and the doors and windows of many houses in the village were blown open. Shejidung is a village with only 13 households in the Kaesong area. The weather was clear on the morning of the 17th. This blatant act of the US side in violating the agreement and invading the Kaesong Neutral Zone occurred after US aircraft invaded our northeastern airspace on the 13th and bombed our eighth prisoner of war camp in the Jiangdong area of northern Korea on the 14th. This series of provocative acts deserves close attention from the people of the world. After our liaison officer notified the other party of this incident and requested a joint investigation, the liaison officers of both sides went to the site for investigation at 4:10 PM. After the investigation was completed, the liaison officers of both sides held a meeting at 6:00 PM. Our liaison officer Zhang Chunshan pointed out that based on the investigation, the other party should bear full responsibility for the bombing of the Kaesong area in violation of the agreement and lodged a verbal protest with the other party's liaison officer Mulai, and requested the other party to guarantee that similar incidents would not occur in the future. When the residents of the Kaesong area learned of this act of the US aircraft violating the agreement, they were extremely indignant and accused: "This is another trick by the American aggressors to sabotage the peace talks."

    我方再次斥美方干涉朝鲜内政的荒谬藉口
    美方竟耍无赖妄图逃避其轰炸我方江东俘虏营的罪责
    美机昨又一次违反协议轰炸开城中立区
    【新华社开城十七日电】十七日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，对方继续以保持军力平衡为藉口，要求过问朝鲜境内机场设备，企图干涉我方内政。我方代表指出对方所谓保持军力平衡的论点，实际上是企图在朝鲜长期保持战争状态与紧张局面。我方一贯的立场是消除战争状态，迅速达成朝鲜问题的彻底和平解决，而从未同意过对方的这一荒谬主张。目前双方所已同意者只有为保证军事停战的稳定，双方不应自朝鲜境外进入增援的军事力量，并无其他协议。双方既已同意在停战期间不自朝鲜境外进入增援的军事力量，包括作战飞机在内，如果对方与我方一样愿意确实作此保证，就根本不能设想双方在朝鲜的空军力量会有所变化。空军力量的基本构成因素显然是作战飞机，如作战飞机的数量不增加，空军力量是不可能有所变化的。从空军力量来说，这就完全保证了军事停战的稳定。至于我方处理朝鲜境内各种设备包含机场设备的问题则完全属于内政问题，我方决不容许任何方面以任何藉口加以任何干涉，这是我方不可动摇的立场。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方对于十四日夜轰炸江东俘虏营，造成七十余名对方被俘人员的伤亡的严重事件，无赖地提出：“俘虏营应有明显标志”，“俘虏营不应该位置在炮火所及的区域内”，
    “俘虏营的精确位置应该事先通知”等等藉口，企图逃避责任。我方代表严词指出：“违反一切国际公法，一切战争法规，对和平城镇无辜居民日夜施行狂轰滥炸的，正是你方。你方所夸耀的空军将朝鲜人民所居住的每一个地区和每一间房屋，作为你们的军事目标，不论有多么显明的标志，你方的空军毫无区分地轰炸了学校、教堂、医院以至于你方被俘人员的俘虏营。在你方的狂轰滥炸中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的战士们，甚至牺牲着自己的生命来救护你方的被俘人员。你有什么资格，你更有什么理由说这次严重事件的责任在于我方。”
    对方在我方代表理直气壮的质问下，无一词以对。两日来对方未得我方同意，将红十字国际委员会代表二人引入会场区，通过对方军事警官，要求会见第四项议程小组委员会我方首席代表李相朝将军。我方军事警官在十七日奉命通知对方军事警官，关于双方红十字会在停战协议签字并生效后，协助遣送战俘的事宜，我方司令官已在一九五一年十二月二十四日致李奇微将军函中作了明白表示。目前我方认为并无必要，也不准备接见红十字国际委员会的代表。我方军事警官并向对方提出，根据双方协议，只有双方代表团、代表团人员得以自由出入会场区，而两天来对方并未征求我方同意，却两次将红十字国际委员会代表引入会场区，殊与协议不合。为此要求对方予以严重注意，使今后不再发生类似情事。
    【新华社开城十六日电】十六日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表再度指出：“我方一月九日的提案，建议双方保证在停战期间不自朝鲜境外进入任何增援的军事力量，并明确规定不得进入作战飞机。如果你方也和我方一样愿意确实作此保证，就不可能设想双方在朝鲜的空军力量会有所增加，你方更没有任何理由再以不增加空军力量为藉口要求限制朝鲜境内机场设备，妄图干涉我方内政。你方又说只要朝鲜有飞机场，我方就可以随时破坏协议，自朝鲜境外运进飞机增加空军力量，你方有什么根据诬蔑我方在谈判中就存心在停战期间破坏可能达成的协议，你方有什么根据可以指责我方不遵守在谈判中达成的协议。相反地，事实上应该指责的正是你方，你方如果愿意继续进行谈判就不应该再作这种荒谬的诬蔑，因为那样你方就否定了双方进行谈判的基础。”
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方仍然未能答复数日来我方所提出的质问而诡辩声称，对方提案中要求我方以流离失所的平民与我方被俘人员进行一对一的交换的建议，只是为了“双方有效地运用输送工具”。我方代表严词指出：“你方一再否认你方企图以战俘为人质，但你方提案第二条却明文规定，要求我方以平民交换同等数目的我方被俘人员。当你方提出这一提案时，我方曾经要求你方解释第二条条文的意义，你在这一帐篷里曾经说过你方对于平民的遣返要求保证，这不是以我方被俘人员作为人质是什么？但你方今天却又改变了花样，说不是平民与战俘交换，是平民与战俘的遣送同时进行，是有效的运用输送工具。你忘记了你方提案中的条文规定，你忘记了你自己作的解释。你方发表的战俘数字较大，你方就想以较大的数量来进行敲诈，但你应该知道战争中的被俘人员不论数量多少是绝对不能作为敲诈的资本的，更不容许充当人质，我们将坚决反对你方以战俘为人质，企图扣留战俘送交朝中人民的死敌的提案。”
    【新华社开城十七日电】本社记者报道：十七日美机又一次破坏协议轰炸开城中立区。九时三十五分，美机两架侵入开城区低空盘旋，九时四十分，又有美机侵入开城区上空并在三英里区内丽陵里社稷洞投下炸弹一枚，弹落村南约两百公尺之山坡上，当即爆炸，弹片飞及一百公尺以外，村内民房门户多被震开。社稷洞是开城区内一个仅有十三户居民的村庄。十七日上午天气晴明。美方这种明目张胆的破坏协议，侵犯开城中立区的行为，是在十三日美机侵犯我国东北的领空，十四日轰炸朝鲜北部江东地区我方第八俘虏营以后发生的。这一连串的挑衅行为值得全世界人民密切注意。经我方联络官将此一事件通知对方并要求进行共同调查后，十六时十分双方联络官同往实地调查。调查完毕后，十八时双方联络官举行会议。我方联络官张春山就对方此次违反协议轰炸开城事件指明根据调查所得对方应负全部责任，向对方联络官穆莱提出口头抗议，并要求对方保证以后勿再发生类似事件。当开城区居民获知美机这次破坏协议的行为后，极为愤慨，纷纷指责：“这又是美国侵略者在玩破坏和平谈判的把戏了。”
