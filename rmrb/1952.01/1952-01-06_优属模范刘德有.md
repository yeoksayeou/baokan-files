Jin Qing, a military dependent in Qingshui Village, Eighth District, Xingcheng County, Liaoxi Province, has been harvesting more grain year after year and his life is getting better and better. When villagers mention Jin Qing's family, they praise Model Serviceman Supporter Liu Deyou for his excellent work in supporting military families.

Jin Qing's son joined the army, and he himself suffers from asthma. In 1949, he farmed seventeen mu of land himself, but he couldn't manage it all. That year, the harvest was poor, yielding only seven shi of grain. He ended the year owing five shi of grain.

Liu Deyou in the village learned about this and thought, "People's sons are joining the army for all of us! We have to take care of him." So, in the winter of that year, Liu Deyou and Old Song from the village found Jin Qing and formed a mutual aid and cooperative farming group.

Liu Deyou is capable and well-known throughout the village. He takes care of Jin Qing at all times. In the spring of 1950, when it was time to plant, the Jin family had nothing, not even seeds. Liu Deyou said, "No problem!" and provided two dou of sorghum and two dou of corn seeds for Old Jin to use as a loan. When it was time to weed in the summer, Old Jin had no food to eat, so Liu Deyou provided him with another shi. That year, the group's land was well-tended, resulting in a bumper harvest. Jin Qing's seventeen mu of land yielded twenty-five shi of grain, two or three times more than the previous year. With this foundation, everyone worked even harder in 1951. The cotton was sprayed with insecticide twice, weeded five times, and hoed five times. In the autumn, Jin Qing's land not only yielded fifteen shi of grain but also harvested five hundred and forty jin of cotton and six hundred and ten jin of ambary hemp, which were equivalent to about fifteen shi of grain.

After these two bumper years, the Jin family became prosperous: the debts were paid off; a large donkey was bought; in 1951 alone, they bought two bolts of cloth just for clothes; and the whole family had a surplus of three shi of grain after eating.

Liu Deyou not only helped Jin Qing but also cared for other military dependents and families of migrant workers. For example, in the winter of 1950, when Zhou Fuzhong was about to go to the Korean front line to carry stretchers, his wife was reluctant because she feared that no one would take care of her. Liu Deyou patiently persuaded her and promised to solve her difficulties. That year, during the Spring Festival, the villagers had the custom of "washing rice" to steam steamed buns. Zhou Fuzhong's family couldn't get rice, and when Liu Deyou found out, he immediately sent her half a dou of yellow rice. Liu Deyou often did things like this. He always enthusiastically helped the families of martyrs and military personnel to solve difficulties in production and life.

In November 1951, Liu Deyou was selected as a model for supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers and went to the provincial capital to participate in the Second Liaoxi Provincial Representative Conference of Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Revolutionary Soldiers, Demobilized Soldiers, and Models of Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Soldiers. At the meeting, after hearing the leaders' call to strive to produce an extra five sheng of grain per mu this year, he said, "We will definitely guarantee to do it." (Xiu)

    优属模范刘德有
    辽西省兴城县八区清水村的军属金庆，这两年来打的粮食一年比一年多，日子也越过越兴旺。村里人一提起金庆家，就称赞优属模范刘德有的优属工作做得好。
    金庆的儿子参军了，自己又有喘病。一九四九年自己种着十七亩地，怎也忙不过来。这年收成不好，才打了七石粮食。一年就欠下了五石粮的债。
    村里的刘德有知道了这件事，他想：“人家儿子参军，是为了咱们大家呀！咱得照顾他。”这样，刘德有就在这年冬天和村里的老宋，找金庆在一起，成立了一个互助代耕组。
    刘德有能干，是全村有名的。他对金庆时时照顾。一九五○年春天要种地了，老金家要啥没啥，连种籽也没着落。刘德有说：“好说！”便拿出二斗高粱、二斗苞米种籽，给老金垫上了。到夏天铲地时，老金没有吃粮了，刘德有又给垫上一石。这一年，组内的地都收拾得挺好，闹了个大丰收。金庆的十七亩地，打了二十五石粮。比头年多了两三倍。有了这个底子，一九五一年大家耕作更有劲了。棉花打了两遍杀虫药水，铲了五遍，?了五遍。到秋天，金庆的地除了打下十五石粮食外，还收了五百四十斤棉花和六百一十斤洋麻，这两项也顶十五石粮左右。
    经过这两个丰年，金庆家富裕起来啦：欠的债早还清了；买了一条大毛驴；一九五一年光添衣服就买了两匹布；全家除了吃还能余下三石粮。
    刘德有不光是帮助了金庆，对别的军属和民工家属也很关心。比如，一九五○年冬天周福中要去朝鲜前线抬担架，他的妻子怕没人照顾就拖后腿。刘德有就耐心地去劝她，并答应她解决困难。这年春节，村里老乡都有“淘米”蒸饽饽的习惯，周福中家淘不上米，刘德有知道了，马上就送给她半斗黄米。像这种事情，刘德有是常作的。他总是热情地帮助烈属军属解决生产上和生活上的困难。
    一九五一年十一月，刘德有被选为拥军优属模范，到省城参加了辽西省第二次烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员军人和拥军优属模范代表会议。会上，听到领导上号召今年争取每亩地多打五升粮，他说：“咱一定保证做到。”（秀）
