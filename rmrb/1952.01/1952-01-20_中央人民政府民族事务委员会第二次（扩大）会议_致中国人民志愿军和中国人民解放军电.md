    I. Cable to the Chinese People's Volunteers
    To Comrade Peng, Commander of the Esteemed Chinese People's Volunteers, and all Comrades:
    We, the attendees and observers of the Second (Enlarged) Meeting of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, representing forty ethnic groups, extend our warm and lofty salute to you on the Korean front.
    This meeting was convened on the basis of unprecedented unity among all ethnic groups; we discussed important issues such as ethnic regional autonomy. Now that the meeting has successfully concluded, we rejoice that all ethnic groups in the country have the right to be masters of their own affairs under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government; we deeply thank Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government. Dear Volunteer Comrades, we also deeply thank you for bravely striking at the American aggressors and defending the common interests of our people of all ethnic groups.
    For more than a year, your brilliant victories have given us concrete education in the combination of patriotism and internationalism. We are pleased to report to you that, in order to support your glorious war on the Korean battlefield, the people of all ethnic groups, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and inspired by you, have enthusiastically launched the campaign to resist America, aid Korea. In the vast minority ethnic areas, workers, farmers, herdsmen, hunters, Ahongs, Lamas, and people from all walks of life have been swept into this torrent. They donated herds of cattle, sheep, horses, camels, and large quantities of furs, melons, fruits, medicinal materials, etc., as donations for airplanes and cannons; people of all ethnic groups have held anti-American demonstrations and marches, signed in support of the five major powers concluding a peace treaty, voted against the United States arming Japan, formulated patriotic pacts and unity pacts, and actively assisted the People's Government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Christians and Catholics of various ethnic minorities in various places have responded to the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, resolutely cutting off ties with imperialism. In the movement to resist America, aid Korea, especially inspired by your continuous victories, ethnic minorities have greatly raised their political awareness, strengthened their patriotic concepts, and established the ideology of hating, despising, and disdaining American imperialism.
    The great struggle to resist America, aid Korea is still continuing. We, the people of all ethnic groups, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to continue to popularize and deepen the movement to resist America, aid Korea, do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, and vigorously increase production and practice economy to support your heroic battles and strengthen national defense construction. On the national defense line where our ethnic minorities live, we must unite and organize to defend the border of the motherland.
    The happiness of our people of all ethnic groups is inseparable from your heroic battles. You—the Chinese People's Volunteers—have become the most beloved people recognized by our people of all ethnic groups. I wish you greater victories.

    II. Cable to the People's Liberation Army
    To Comrade Zhu, Esteemed Commander-in-Chief, and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:
    Because of your heroic and skillful fighting, overcoming incomparable difficulties, and liberating the regions of our various ethnic groups, representatives of our various ethnic groups are able to gather together today in the people's capital, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, to discuss and implement Chairman Mao's great ethnic policy. We, on behalf of the people of all ethnic minorities across the country, thank you and extend our lofty salute to you.
    Most of our ethnic minorities live in the remote borders, suffering the aggression of imperialism and the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the running dogs of imperialism. They tried every means to split our great family of ethnic groups. Now, with you standing on the national defense line of the great motherland, we have the strength to crush any enemy's conspiracy. We assure you that we will do everything in our power to support you.
    Esteemed Commander-in-Chief Zhu, every one of our ethnic minority people and every one of the People's Liberation Army comrades have become brothers and sisters with flesh-and-blood ties. Our sons and grandsons will sing your praises and commemorate you from generation to generation with the songs of our various ethnic groups. We will always unite together to consolidate and develop the great family of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups led by Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party!

    中央人民政府民族事务委员会第二次（扩大）会议
    致中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军电
    一、致中国人民志愿军电敬爱的中国人民志愿军彭司令员转全体同志们：
    我们出席中央人民政府民族事务委员会第二次（扩大）会议的出席、列席人员，包括四十个民族，向在朝鲜前线的你们，谨致热烈崇高的敬礼。
    这次会议是在各民族空前团结的基础上召开的；我们讨论了民族区域自治等重要问题。现在会议已经胜利闭幕，我们庆幸全国各民族都在中央人民政府的统一领导下，有了自己当家作主的权利；我们深深地感谢毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府。亲爱的志愿军同志们，我们也深切地感激你们，因为你们英勇地打击着美国侵略者，保卫着我们各民族人民的共同利益。
    一年多以来，你们的光辉胜利，给了我们以爱国主义与国际主义相结合的具体教育。我们很高兴地报告你们：为了支持你们在朝鲜战场上的光荣战争，各族人民在毛主席的领导和你们的感召下，已经热烈展开了抗美援朝运动。在广阔的少数民族地区，各族工人、农民、牧民、猎户、阿訇、喇嘛及其他各界人民，都卷入了这一运动的洪流。他们捐献了成群的牛、羊、马、骆驼和大批的皮毛、瓜果、药材等物作为飞机大炮的捐款；各族人民纷纷举行反美示威游行，签名拥护五大国缔结和平公约，投票反对美国武装日本，订立爱国公约、团结公约，并积极协助人民政府镇压反革命。各地少数民族的基督教徒、天主教徒，都响应了三自革新运动，坚决割断与帝国主义的联系。在抗美援朝运动中，特别是在你们不断的胜利鼓舞下，少数民族大大地提高了政治觉悟，加强了爱国观念，并树立了仇视、蔑视、鄙视美帝国主义的思想。
    抗美援朝的伟大斗争现在还在继续进行。我们各族人民坚决响应毛主席的号召，继续普及和深入抗美援朝运动，做好拥军优属的工作，厉行增产节约，以支持你们的英勇战斗，加强国防建设。在我们少数民族聚居的国防线上，我们更要团结与组织起来，保卫祖国的边疆。
    我们各族人民的幸福是和你们的英勇战斗分不开的。你们——中国人民志愿军，已经成为我们各族人民公认的最可爱的人。祝你们获得更大的胜利。
    二、致人民解放军电敬爱的朱总司令转中国人民解放军全体指战员同志们：
    由于你们英勇善战，克服了无比的艰难，解放了我们各民族的地区，我们各民族的代表今天才能在人民首都会聚一堂，在中央人民政府领导下，商讨贯彻毛主席的伟大的民族政策。我们谨代表全国各少数民族人民感激你们，并向你们致崇高的敬礼。
    我们少数民族大多居住在辽远的边疆，受尽了帝国主义的侵略和帝国主义的走狗国民党反动派的压迫。他们千方百计要分裂我们各民族的大家庭。现在，有了你们站在伟大祖国的国防线上，我们就有了粉碎任何敌人阴谋的力量。我们向你们保证：我们一定竭尽全力支援你们。
    敬爱的朱总司令，我们每一个少数民族人民和每一个人民解放军同志已经成了血肉相关的亲兄弟、亲姊妹。我们的子子孙孙，世世代代要用我们各民族的歌唱来颂扬你们，纪念你们。我们永远团结在一起，为巩固和发展毛主席、中国共产党所领导的各民族友爱合作的大家庭而奋斗！
