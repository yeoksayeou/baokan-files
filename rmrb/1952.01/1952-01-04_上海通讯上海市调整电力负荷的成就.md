Shanghai Communication: Achievements in Adjusting Electricity Load in Shanghai
Song Jun

    Since October 1951, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government's Public Utilities Bureau, Shanghai has comprehensively adjusted its electricity load. Since liberation, Shanghai's electricity generation has greatly increased. If we take the electricity generation in June 1949 as 100, it had reached 163.6 by October 1951, exceeding the historical peak. In terms of equipment utilization, it has been increasing month by month since the autumn of 1951. The monthly utilization rate in November 1951 reached 64.97%, setting a national record for electricity industry equipment utilization. However, as the economic situation further improved, especially after the start of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign in the winter of 1951, more electricity was needed. The original total power generation could no longer meet the new needs. Therefore, continuing to tap potential capacity, improve equipment utilization, and ensure electricity supply became a major task.

    The Necessity and Possibility of Adjusting Electricity Load

    One way to unleash the potential of existing equipment is to adjust the electricity load to balance electricity consumption at all times of day and night. Shanghai's electricity supply load is unbalanced at different times. There are three peak periods each day: the first peak is from 8:00 AM (when factories start work) to 11:00 AM (when factories break), the second peak is from 2:00 PM (when factories start work) to 5:00 PM (when factories break), and the third peak is from 6:00 PM (when residential electricity consumption begins) to 10:00 PM (when users go to sleep). During these three peak load periods, the power plant's power generation has reached saturation. Any further increase in industrial electricity consumption will affect the production of other factories, the supply of essential electricity for trams, water supply, and even endanger the safety of power plants. However, a large amount of electricity outside the three peak load periods (especially the ten hours from 10:00 PM to 8:00 AM the next day) is not being utilized. This is a serious waste of electricity. Calculated on a daily basis, about 20% of the total electricity is idle between peak and low loads each day. Calculated on a monthly basis, because the rest days of all factories are concentrated on Sunday, about 15% of the total electricity production is idle each month. Therefore, appropriately adjusting the electricity load can greatly unleash potential capacity.

    It was impossible to reasonably adjust the electricity load before liberation. During the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, Shanghai's electricity industry was in a state of division, making unified adjustment impossible. After liberation, all electricity companies in Shanghai formed a unified power grid, with unified dispatch, mutual support, and unified electricity prices. In this way, rational adjustment became possible. This is a concrete manifestation of the superiority of the New Democratic social system. In 1950, the implementation of scheduled electricity usage (which is the adjustment of electricity load) in all textile factories in the city reduced the electricity load during peak load periods by 20,000 kilowatts.

    Methods and Gains of Adjusting Electricity Load

    In order to guarantee the electricity supply during the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government's Public Utilities Bureau began to comprehensively adjust the electricity load in October 1951. This adjustment of electricity load adopted two main methods: one was to reduce the peak load: factories with more than 100 horsepower were required to yield electricity for two hours during peak load periods. Each factory arranged these two hours of production during low electricity load periods according to its own actual situation. The second was to fill the low electricity load. All electricity users were required to make full use of the idle electricity during daily rest times and Sundays. The specific measures for implementing these two methods were: the quitting and starting times of factories were staggered, some were brought forward, and some were postponed. Factories with continuous production reduced electricity consumption during peak load periods, while some factories that previously operated during the day were switched to night shifts; factories operating early night shifts shifted their night shift times later; factories operating day and night shifts changed to having more night shifts than day shifts, so that the idle electricity in the late night could be utilized. Factory rest days were also organized and scheduled separately, so that the idle electricity on rest days could also be utilized.

    After adjusting the electricity load, the equipment utilization rate of Shanghai's electricity industry increased by 4.9% in November 1951 compared to October (from 60.07% to 64.97%). Without increasing the electricity load, this was equivalent to an increase of 10 million kilowatt-hours of electricity (equivalent to the power for weaving 2 million bolts of cloth).

    Two Insights from Adjusting Electricity Load

    First, to smoothly adjust the electricity load, it is necessary to rely on the working class and overcome the difficulties caused by changes in production procedures. To achieve this, we must first conduct thorough and extensive propaganda and education on the economic and political significance and value of adjusting electricity load in a way that is easy to understand. The Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau used newspapers, radio broadcasts, cartoons, slides, and discussion meetings to carry out propaganda during this adjustment of electricity load. Ye Jinming, the director of the Public Utilities Bureau, personally gave a popular broadcast to all employees in the city. These propaganda and education efforts had a great effect. For example, after the adjustment of electricity usage time, some workers who originally worked during the day now had to work night shifts; those who originally ate lunch at 12 o'clock now had to eat at 1 o'clock. At first, everyone felt very inconvenient, but when they learned that adjusting the electricity load was for rational electricity use, to ensure the smooth progress of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, and to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, these inconveniences were no longer a problem. For example, Zhou Xiaodi and 23 other workers in the pulp-making workshop of the Hezhong Paper Mill used their brains and quickly solved the production difficulties caused by the adjustment of electricity load, ensuring that production volume was not affected.

    Second, adjusting electricity load requires ideological struggle to oppose the departmentalism of some enterprise leaders and the purely technical viewpoints of electricity management personnel. Shanghai's experience proves that departmentalism, which only cares about the convenience of electricity use in one's own enterprise and does not obey overall allocation, is the biggest obstacle to adjusting electricity load. The basic method for solving this problem is to actively conduct ideological education among electricity users; but it is also necessary to formulate certain electricity distribution rules and handling methods for violations of the rules. On the other hand, we must also correct the purely technical viewpoints of electricity management personnel. Adjusting electricity load is by no means just a technical work for electricity management personnel, but a large-scale mass work and organizational work. Electricity management personnel must conduct thorough investigations and research, understand the production situation of each enterprise and the living situation of workers, and, under the leadership and support of the Party and the government, obtain the close cooperation and assistance of various industrial departments, trade unions, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, trade associations, and various propaganda institutions. In this way, the work of adjusting electricity load can proceed smoothly.

    上海通讯上海市调整电力负荷的成就
    宋军
    上海市自一九五一年十月份开始，在市人民政府公用局的领导下，全面地调整了电力负荷。解放以来，上海市电力工业的发电量已经大大提高。如以一九四九年六月的发电量为一○○，一九五一年十月份已是一六三点六，超过了历史上的最高水平。在设备利用率方面，从一九五一年秋季以后，已经逐月提高。一九五一年十一月的月利用率已达到百分之六四点九七，创造了全国电业设备利用率的最高纪录。但是，在经济情况进一步好转以后，特别是一九五一年冬季增产节约运动开始以后，需要更多的电力供应。原有的发电总量已不能满足新的需要了。因之，继续发掘潜在能力，提高设备利用率，保证电力供应，就成为一个重大任务。
    调整电力负荷的必要性和可能性
    发挥现有设备潜在能力的办法之一，便是调整电力负荷，使日夜各个时间的用电量趋于平衡。上海市各个时间的供电负荷是不平衡的，每天要出现三次高峰：第一次高峰在早晨八时（各工厂开工）到上午十一时（放工），第二次高峰在下午二时（各工厂开工）到五时（放工），第三次高峰在晚上六时（住宅开始用电）到十时（用户睡觉）。在这三次高峰负荷的时间内，电厂发电量已达到饱和点，再要增加工业用电，就会影响其他厂的生产，影响电车、自来水等必要用电的供应，甚至会危害到发电厂的安全，但在三个高峰负荷时间以外的大量电力（特别是晚上十时到第二天上午八时的十小时内的）没有被利用。这是电力的严重浪费。如以日计算，每日高峰负荷和低负荷之间约有总电量的百分之二十空闲着；如以月计算，因各工厂的休息日都集中在星期日一天，每月约有总生产电量的百分之十五空闲着。所以，适当地调整电力负荷，就能大量地发挥潜在能力。
    合理地调整电力负荷，在解放以前是不可能做到的。在帝国主义、国民党反动派统治时期，上海电力工业是处在分割状态之下，无法统一调整。解放后，上海市所有电力公司组成了一个统一的供电网，统一调度，互相支援，并且统一了电价。这样，合理调整便成为可能了。这是新民主主义社会制度优越性的具体体现。一九五零年全市纺织厂实行了定时用电（就是调整电力负荷），就使高峰负荷时间内的电力负荷减低了二万瓩。
    调整电力负荷的办法和收获
    为了保证增产节约运动中的电力供应，上海市人民政府公用局自一九五一年十月份开始全面调整电力负荷。这次调整电力负荷采取两个主要办法：一是压低高峰负荷：一百马力以上的工厂，在高峰负荷时间分别让电二小时。各厂根据自己的实际情况，把这二小时的生产安排在低电力负荷时间内。一是填平低电力负荷。各电力用户要尽量利用每天休息时间和星期日的空闲电力。实行这两个办法的具体措施是：各工厂的放工、开工时间相互交错，有的提前，有的移后。连续生产的工厂，在高峰负荷期间减少用电量，同时把部分开日工的厂改为开夜工；开前夜班的厂把夜班时间移后；开日、夜工的改为夜班多于日班，使深夜的空闲电力得以利用。工厂休息日也被有组织地分别排定，使休息日的空闲电力也可以被利用起来。
    经过调整电力负荷以后，上海市电力工业设备利用率，一九五一年十一月份比十月份提高了百分之四·九（从百分之六○·○七提高到百分之六四·九七），在不增高电力负荷的情况下，等于增加了电力一千万度（相当于织二百万疋布的动力）。
    调整电力负荷中的两点体会
    第一，要顺利地调整电力负荷，必须依靠工人阶级，克服由于生产程序改变而引起的困难。要做到这一点，首先必须把调整电力负荷在经济上、政治上的意义和价值，用通俗易懂的方法，进行深入的广泛的宣传教育。上海市公用局在这次调整电力负荷时运用了报纸、广播、漫画、幻灯、座谈会等方式进行宣传，公用局局长叶进明并亲自向全市职工作通俗广播。这些宣传教育工作收到了很大的效果。例如调整了用电时间后，有些工人本来是白天工作的，现在要上夜班；本来是十二点钟吃午饭的，现在要到一点钟了。开始大家都觉得很不方便，但当他们知道调整电力负荷是为了合理用电、为了保证增产节约运动的顺利开展、为了支持中国人民志愿军时，这些不方便就不算什么问题了。例如，合众造纸厂打纸浆车间周小弟等二十四名工人开动脑筋，迅速解决了调整电力负荷所引起的生产上的困难，使生产量不受影响。
    第二，调整电力负荷必须进行思想斗争，反对部分企业领导干部中的本位主义思想和电业管理人员中的单纯技术观点。上海市的经验证明：只顾本企业用电方便、不服从全面调配的本位主义思想，是调整电力负荷的最大障碍。解决这个问题的基本办法，是积极地对用电单位进行思想教育；但也必须制定一定的配电规则和违反规则的处理办法。另一方面还必须纠正电业管理人员的单纯技术观点。调整电力负荷决不只是电业管理人员的技术工作，而是一个规模巨大的群众工作和组织工作。电业管理人员要进行充分的调查研究，了解各企业生产情况和工人生活情况，在党和政府的领导和支持下，取得各产业部门、工会、工商联、同业公会、各宣传机构的密切配合和协助。这样，调整电力负荷的工作才能顺利进行。
