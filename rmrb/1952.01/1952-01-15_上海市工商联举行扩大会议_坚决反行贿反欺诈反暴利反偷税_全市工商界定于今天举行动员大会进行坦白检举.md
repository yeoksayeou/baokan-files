Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 14th: The Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce held an enlarged joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the 12th to discuss the principles and steps for launching a large-scale and vigorous campaign against bribery, fraud, profiteering, and tax evasion in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles. Sheng Pihua, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, explained the great significance of this campaign at the meeting and introduced the situation of the campaign carried out by the industrial and commercial circles in Beijing and Tianjin. He emphasized that Shanghai's industry and commerce have been most affected by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism for nearly a century. Although most industrialists and businessmen have made significant political progress in the past two years and have made certain contributions to developing production and promoting material exchange, some people still violate policies and laws, engage in bribery and fraud, evade taxes, and pursue exorbitant profits. The severity of these actions may exceed that of Beijing and Tianjin. He said: "We must draw a clear line between legitimate businessmen and illegal businessmen, and we must thoroughly eliminate the criminal acts that violate national laws and disciplines within the industrial and commercial circles, and completely eliminate all the bad thoughts, bad habits, and bad styles left over from the old society, in order to further develop production and participate in the country's economic construction." He called on the directors and supervisors present to take the lead in examining themselves, confessing, and reporting in this campaign.

The meeting discussed the preliminary plan for Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles to launch a campaign against bribery, fraud, profiteering, and tax evasion. The plan requires this campaign to become a large-scale, vigorous mass movement in the city's industrial and commercial circles. The plan stipulates that a mobilization meeting of Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles against bribery, fraud, profiteering, and tax evasion will be held on January 15 to make the significance of this campaign "known to every household and understood by everyone" in the city's industrial and commercial circles. After this mobilization meeting, self-examination and mutual examination will be carried out from top to bottom in various industries and regions throughout the city. The heads of all trade associations should personally take action in their respective industries or regions to take the lead in promoting confession and exposure. At the end of the campaign, the achievements of the campaign should be summarized, and the patriotic covenants of various industries and units should be revised.

In order to carry out this movement in an organized and step-by-step manner, the meeting decided to establish the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Circles Anti-Bribery, Anti-Fraud, Anti-Profiteering, and Anti-Tax Evasion Campaign Committee, under which an office is set up to be responsible for regular propaganda and mobilization work, and an inspection room is set up to receive and handle confessed and reported cases. In addition, several inspection teams will be organized as needed to assist various industries in conducting inspections.

    上海市工商联举行扩大会议
    坚决反行贿反欺诈反暴利反偷税
    全市工商界定于今天举行动员大会进行坦白检举
    【新华社上海十四日电】上海市工商业联合会在十二日举行临时理监事扩大联席会议，讨论在上海市工商界大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地开展反对行贿、反对欺诈、反对暴利、反对偷税漏税运动的方针和步骤。上海市工商业联合会主任委员盛丕华在会上说明了这一运动的巨大意义，并介绍了北京、天津两市工商界开展这一运动的情况。他着重指出：上海市工商业近百年来受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的影响最大，虽然大多数工商业家两年多来在政治上已有显著进步，在发展生产、促进物资交流方面也有一定的贡献，但仍有一部分人破坏政策法令，行贿欺诈，偷税漏税，追求暴利，其严重程度可能要超过北京和天津。他说：“我们必须划清正当商人和不法商人的界限，必须在工商界内部彻底肃清违犯国家法纪的罪恶行为，彻底消灭旧社会遗留下来的一切坏思想、坏习惯、坏作风，以便进一步发展生产和参加祖国的经济建设。”他号召到会的理监事在这一运动中首先带头检查自己，进行坦白和检举。
    会议讨论了上海市工商界开展反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷税漏税运动的初步方案。这个方案要求这一运动成为全市工商界的一个大规模的轰轰烈烈的群众性运动。方案规定：在一月十五日召开上海市工商界反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏动员大会，以便使这一运动的意义在全市工商界中“家喻户晓，人人尽知”。这次动员大会后立即在全市各行业、各地区开展自上而下的自我检查和相互检查，各同业公会的负责人都应在本行业或本地区内亲自动手，带头推动，进行坦白和检举。在运动结束时，应该总结运动的成就，修订各行业各单位的爱国公约。
    为了有组织有步骤地展开这一运动，会议决定成立上海市工商界反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏运动委员会，下设办公室负责经常的宣传动员工作，设检查室接受和处理坦白的及检举的案件。此外将根据工作需要，组织若干检查组，协助各行业进行检查。
