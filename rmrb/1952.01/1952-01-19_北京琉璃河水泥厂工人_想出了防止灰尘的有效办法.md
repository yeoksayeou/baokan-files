    Workers at the Beijing Liulihe Cement Plant
    Devise Effective Dust Prevention Methods
    Comrade Editor: Since October of last year, the workers at the Beijing Liulihe Cement Plant have conquered dust. Before liberation, due to the factory's outdated machinery and the reactionaries' disregard for workers' lives, there were no dust prevention facilities, and workers inhaled an unknown amount of cement and stone powder every day. For example, at the raw stone cone machine in the raw materials workshop, stone powder flew everywhere. Workers in this workshop inhaled half a kilogram of stone powder each month. Another example is warehouse X in the loading and unloading workshop. When workers released the cement, the dust was so thick that you couldn't see the person across from you. The workers' noses were dry every day, and their phlegm often contained bits of cement. After liberation, the cement plant's administration, in order to solve the dust problem, installed some dust collectors and distributed dust masks and other dust prevention equipment. But at that time, the workers didn't pay attention to these. They thought, "If there are worms in the vegetables, you die in the vegetables. How can you work in a cement plant and not eat some cement!" This problem became more and more serious as production continued to increase. In October of last year, the entire plant launched a major safety inspection campaign. Leading cadres convened a mobilization meeting on dust prevention, set out reward methods and work directions. The loading and unloading, raw materials, and other workshops held "Zhuge Liang meetings" one after another, mobilizing the masses to come up with dust prevention methods. The surge of dust when releasing cement in warehouse X of the loading and unloading workshop was a serious problem. Liu Qixiang, a worker in this workshop, and the workers in his team first came up with a method to correct the previous problem of a large amount of cement flying out from the open mouth because they were watching the amount of cement. This greatly strengthened the confidence of workers in various workshops in overcoming dust. They put forward many rationalization proposals, using rubber pads or burlap pieces to block all the dust-leaking seams on the machines. The previously installed dust prevention equipment also exerted dust prevention effectiveness after being modified by the workers. In this way, the workers solved the problem of dust prevention. Places where cement and stone powder used to fly everywhere have now become clean and refreshing. The amount of dust in this plant has been reduced by 80 percent, which not only protects the health of the workers but also prevents a lot of cement from being lost. Lu Niangao

### 北京琉璃河水泥厂工人  想出了防止灰尘的有效办法

    北京琉璃河水泥厂工人
    想出了防止灰尘的有效办法
    编辑同志：北京琉璃河水泥厂的工人，从去年十月份起，战胜了灰尘。解放以前，因为厂里的机器破旧和反动派不重视工人生命，毫无防尘设备，工人们每天不知要吸进多少的洋灰和石粉。如原料车间的原石锥式机下面，石粉飞扬。在这车间里的工人，一个月要吸进一斤石粉。又如装运车间的某号仓库，在工人放灰的时候，灰尘飞扬得对面不见人。工人的鼻子每天都干得要命，痰里常有洋灰片。解放以后，水泥厂的行政方面为了解决灰尘问题，曾经装了些收尘器，发了口罩等防尘设备。但那时工人们不注意这些。他们认为：“菜里虫，菜里死，在洋灰厂干活还能不吃点洋灰！”这个问题随着生产的不断提高而越见严重。去年十月，全厂展开了保安大检查运动。领导干部召开防灰堵尘动员大会，定出了奖励办法和工作方向。装运、原料等车间纷纷召开“诸葛亮会”，发动群众想防尘办法。装运车间某号仓库在放灰时的爆腾是一个严重的问题。这个车间工人刘起祥和他所在的小组工人首先想出了一个办法，纠正了以前因看洋灰数量而使大量洋灰从敞口处飞出来的毛病。这件事大大地加强了各车间工人战胜灰尘的信心。他们提出了很多合理化建议，把机器上的跑灰缝子都用胶皮垫或麻袋片来堵死；从前安装的防尘设备，也因经过工人的修改后而发挥了防尘效力。这样，工人们就解决了防止灰尘的问题。以前洋灰和石粉乱飞的地方，现在都已经变成清清爽爽的了。这个厂里的灰尘量已减少了百分之八十，这不只使工人的健康不受损害，而且也使洋灰少跑掉了好多。　卢念高
