    Peasants in Various Regions Assure Chairman Mao of Increasing Yield Per Unit Area
    Shanxi Huguan Cuigu Village Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Last year's average wheat yield was 2.7 shi per mu, this year's plan is to increase it by another 30 jin per mu.
    Respected Chairman Mao: We are reporting our achievements in developing production through organization to you with excitement and joy, as a New Year's gift for 1952.
    We live in Cuigu Village, Huguan County, Shanxi Province. This is a remote small mountain village with scattered farmland. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, nine of our households farmed less than 100 mu of thin hillside land, totaling 520 plots. It took a lot of labor, but the harvest was small. Of this 100 mu, only about 40 mu belonged to us, the rest was rented from landlords. At that time, we always lived on bran and wild herbs. After our area was liberated in 1943, the rent reduction and land reform were implemented, and we were allocated land, which greatly increased our enthusiasm for production. In 1945, responding to your call to "get organized," nine of our households began to form a mutual aid team (now developed to twelve households). Due to organized production, improved technology, and close integration with sideline production and supply and marketing cooperatives, we have become very different in a few years. These twelve households of ours have changed from poor to rich, and every family has surplus grain. Now, our mutual aid team has common property worth ten shi of millet and a public accumulation fund of fifteen shi of millet. In the spring of 1951, our mutual aid team began to pilot an agricultural production cooperative. Under the direct guidance and assistance of the CPC Changzhi Regional Committee and the CPC Huguan County Committee, our agricultural production cooperative has demonstrated its superiority: First, fertilization and sowing can be adapted to local conditions, giving full play to the effectiveness of land and fertilizer; second, the method of "scoring according to labor and calculating work according to tasks" is implemented, rationally utilizing labor; third, there is more capital accumulation, technology is continuously improved, and production is expanded. In this way, we achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in 1951. The average yield per mu in the cooperative reached 2 shi, 7 dou, and 1.8 sheng, exceeding the expected yield of 1 shi, 7 dou, and 5.6 sheng, exceeding the pre-war yield of 1 shi, 7 dou, and 1.8 sheng, exceeding the 1950 yield of 7 dou and 1.8 sheng, and exceeding the village's production level by 4 dou and 6.5 sheng. At the same time, 470 workdays were saved during the busy farming season for sideline production. Before the autumn harvest, sideline income had reached more than 20.28 million yuan, and after the autumn harvest, the entire cooperative participated in sideline production such as oil pressing and brick burning, earning 23 shi of rice in just half a winter. In 1952, we plan to increase the average yield per mu by another 30 jin of grain. We are confident of achieving this goal. Therefore, we have responded to the challenge competition for increased production from model mutual aid teams such as Li Shunda and Zhang Zhiquan.
    In order to "increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers," we have saved 150 jin of millet, accumulated twelve carts of coal, and added eight pieces of farm equipment in the past month. We are also preparing for agricultural production work in 1952. We have made three donations, and our substitute farming work ranks first in the village. We will do better in 1952 than in 1951. We wish you eternal health.

    各地农民向毛主席保证提高单位面积产量
    山西壶关萃谷村农业生产合作社
    去年每亩平均产麦二石七斗  今年计划每亩再增产三十斤
    敬爱的毛主席：我们怀着兴奋愉快的心情向您报告我们组织起来发展生产的成绩，作为一九五二年新年的献礼。
    我们住在山西壶关县萃谷村。这是一个偏僻的小山庄，耕地很分散。在抗日战争以前，我们之中有九户种着不到一百亩山坡薄地，共有五百二十块。用工很多，打粮很少。这一百亩地属于我们自己的还只有四十来亩，其余都是向地主租种的。那时我们总是吃糠咽菜度日。一九四三年我们这地方解放后，实行了减租和土地改革，我们分得了土地，生产劲头就大了。一九四五年，响应您的“组织起来”的号召，我们开始有九户组成了一个互助组（现在已发展到十二户）。由于组织起来生产，提高了技术，又和副业生产、供销合作社密切结合，几年功夫，我们就大不一样了。我们这十二户已由穷变富，家家有了余粮。现在我们互助组里已存有价值十石小米的共同财产和十五石小米的公积金。一九五一年春天，我们这个互助组开始试办为农业生产合作社。在中共长治地方委员会和中共壶关县委员会的直接指导和帮助下，我们这个农业生产合作社已显示出它的优越性：一、施肥播种，可以作到因地制宜，充分发挥了土地和肥料的效能；二、实行了“按劳评分，按活计工”的办法，合理地发挥劳动力的效能；三、资金积累多了，技术不断改进，生产扩大了。这样，我们一九五一年就得到了一个空前的大丰收。社内每亩平均产量达到了二石七斗一升八，超过应产量一石七斗五升六，超过战前一石七斗一升八，超过一九五○年七斗一升八，超过全村生产水平四斗六升五。同时在农忙季节还节余了四百七十个工来进行副业生产。在秋收前副业收入已达到二千零二十八万多元，秋收后全社参加榨油、烧砖等副业生产，只过了半个冬天已赚下二十三石米。一九五二年我们计划每亩平均再增产三十斤粮食。我们有信心达到这个奋斗目标。因此我们已向李顺达、张志全等模范互助组的增产挑战竞赛应了战。
    为了“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”，我们一个月来已从各方面节约下一百五十斤小米，积了十二车煤炭，添了八件农具，我们还正在给一九五二年的农业生产工作进行准备。我们已捐献了三次，我们的代耕工作在全村数第一。我们在一九五二年要比一九五一年作得更好。祝您永远健康
    山西壶关县萃谷村农业生产合作社全体社员
