New Developments in Water Conservancy Construction Projects in Various Regions

Winter Huai River Harnessing Projects Mostly Completed; Labor Efficiency of Workers Greatly Improved

The second annual winter Huai River harnessing project is nearing completion, with some areas having completed or exceeded their original targets ahead of schedule. To date, the river course improvement projects in Henan Province, in the upper reaches of the Huai River, have been fully completed. The Hong and Ru River dredging projects in Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, completed over five million cubic meters of earthwork in forty days. One of the drainage tunnels of the Baisha Reservoir, measuring 346 meters in length, has been excavated and is now being filled with concrete. The spillway of the Banqiao Reservoir, measuring 340 meters in length (extended by 39 meters compared to the original plan), has also been fully completed. The earth dams of these two reservoirs are now being raised daily. In Anhui Province, north of the Huai River, under the jurisdiction of the Fuyang Prefecture, 97 percent of the winter project tasks have been completed, accounting for 35 percent of the annual target. The reconstruction of the Shangji Dike, Zheng Nan Huai Dike, and Huo Qiu Minsheng Dike, the reinforcement of the Jiang Po Tang embankment, and the East Fei River drainage canal projects in the Liu'an Prefecture have all fulfilled their planned tasks. The winter project of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal in the lower reaches is also nearing completion. Among them, the Yancheng Prefecture, by December 23rd of last year, had excavated more than 16 million cubic meters of earthwork in over 30 days, completing and exceeding the winter project tasks ahead of schedule.

The winter Huai River harnessing project last year was closely integrated with the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. Patriotic labor emulation campaigns were widely launched among the workers in various regions. For example, in the Huaiyuan County worker brigade participating in the Chong and Tong River dredging project near Wuhe, nearly 700 worker teams participated in the labor emulation, accounting for over 50 percent of the total worker teams. The workers from the suburban county worker brigade and the Yu County worker brigade who were building the Baisha Reservoir in the upper reaches also challenged and responded to each other. All 300,000 workers in Yancheng Prefecture, Subei, were involved in this movement. The challenge competition initiated by Jin Xiulan, a model worker in harnessing the Huai River from Wanbei, and Ding Guangfu's group from the Chelu Brigade, Gaoyou County, Taizhou Prefecture, Subei, to the workers in Wanbei and Subei, played a significant role in promoting this movement.

The winter projects in many areas were very arduous, but due to the launch of the patriotic labor emulation campaign, the difficulties were overcome by the workers one by one. For example, in the Subei Irrigation Main Canal project, the terrain at the construction site of the Gaoyou Brigade in Taizhou Prefecture was low-lying, and water seepage was serious. However, the workers overcame the difficulty of water seepage by digging drainage ditches in the severe cold of minus three degrees Celsius after snowfall. In the Fengshan Cut Ridge project in Wanbei, the workers encountered hard sandy gravel, which they finally conquered with their diligent hands and strong will.

During the patriotic labor emulation, the workers understood that labor emulation was not about "brute force." They actively used their brains and found ways to improve labor efficiency. For example, workers on the Subei Irrigation Main Canal construction site proposed the slogan of "Three齐 (qí, meaning aligned or complete)" to improve labor efficiency, that is, each worker team should achieve 人齐 (rén qí, complete personnel), 心齐 (xīn qí, united minds), and 工具齐 (gōng jù qí, complete tools). In addition, the supply work, sanitation work, and engineering technical guidance work at the construction site were all well-managed, and the workers also improved the water pumping efficiency of the pumps, so that each worker on the entire construction site did half a cubic meter more earthwork per day than in the past. Some workers could do five cubic meters of earthwork per day, and the most one day was 7.8 cubic meters. The workers of the Huaiyuan County Huai River Harnessing Brigade proposed the slogan of "Thirteen 比 (bǐ, meaning compete)" such as "compete in patriotism by action, compete in engineering by standards, compete in labor by skills, compete in tools by improvement, and compete in unity by mutual assistance," which greatly inspired the creativity of the workers and improved work efficiency. After the worker Chang Haoyuan improved the method of "digging mud" (digging up the mud, drying it in the sun, and then carrying it away), he increased labor efficiency by one-third. Jin Xiulan's team in Sixian created the "separate row digging method," which increased the efficiency of carrying earth by more than 20 baskets per day per porter. The workers of the 15th platoon of the 4th brigade of Yu County, Henan, who participated in the construction of the Baisha Reservoir in the upper reaches, formed the "Zhuge Liang Group" (technical research group) to improve work methods, so that the project, which was originally required to be completed in 20 days, was completed in 17 days. In addition, after the workers in Yingshang County, Fuyang Prefecture, implemented the contract responsibility system, labor efficiency increased from 1.8 cubic meters per person per day to 2.5 cubic meters per person per day. The Wuhe County worker brigade (with a total of 40,000 workers) in Wanbei improved the supply work for the Huai River harnessing workers, so that more than 1,000 workers who were busy all day with receiving grain, buying vegetables, and other chores in the Wuhe worker brigade could all be put into the earthwork work. In this way, more than 148,000 cubic meters of earthwork could be done in this winter renovation.

At present, except for the Baisha and Banqiao Reservoir projects in the upper reaches and the dredging and renovation projects in some areas in the middle reaches, the remaining projects are nearing completion, and the workers have begun to return home one after another. The Huai River harnessing agencies in various regions are about to summarize their work and prepare for the further Huai River harnessing projects in the spring of this year. (Comprehensive)

Huang River Ice Mitigation and Diversion Project Completed; Threat of Ice Floods Eliminated for Counties Such as Lijin

Xinhua News Agency – The ice mitigation and diversion project in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in Shandong Province was fully completed on December 5th of last year after two months of construction. In the future, the threat of ice flood breaches will be eliminated for the Lijin and Kenli sections of the Yellow River's tail end. This project includes a spillway weir and a new diversion canal. If the Yellow River's mouth is blocked by ice, making it difficult for the river water to discharge, the control gates of the spillway weir can be opened to divert the river water from the new diversion canal into the old course of the Yellow River to the sea. The spillway weir is located on the Yellow River levee north of Xiaojiezi Village in Lijin County on the south bank of the Yellow River, with a total length of 200 meters and a height of 12 meters. A 38-meter-wide water release gap is left in the middle of the weir body, and control gates are installed on the gap. The new diversion canal starts from the gap of the spillway weir and enters the old course of the Yellow River between Dongzhangzhuang and Xiaoninghai Village in Lijin County, with a length of about 17 kilometers. Two new levees, totaling more than 40 kilometers in length, have also been built on both sides of the diversion canal. There are 69 small villages between the two new levees on both sides of the new diversion canal, and protective embankments have been built around these villages. In addition, the old Yellow River levees in Lijin and Kenli counties have also been reinforced this time. Except for the spillway weir, the total earthwork of the entire project is more than 2.54 million cubic meters. A total of 70,000 technicians and workers participated in the construction of this project.

The river channel in the Yellow River's mouth section is narrow, with many shoals and shallow water, making it most prone to ice accumulation every winter. When the Yellow River begins to thaw in the spring, the coastal areas thaw later due to the colder climate. The ice floes拥 (yōng, meaning congested or crowded) from the upper reaches block the river, preventing the river water from discharging, which leads to breaches and disasters. In order to eliminate the threat of ice floods to the people of Lijin and other areas every year, the Shandong Provincial People's Government decided to build this project last spring. During the construction period, many workers actively labored, breaking ice and entering the water in the severe cold of minus nine degrees Celsius, demonstrating a high degree of construction enthusiasm.

After the completion of the ice mitigation and diversion project, not only has the threat of Yellow River ice floods to Lijin, Kenli, and other counties been eliminated, but also during the peach flood season every year, the diversion canal can also release water to irrigate about 400,000 mu of farmland. A barren land by the sea will be transformed into a fertile field, and the drinking water problem for the people in the water-scarce areas by the sea will also be solved. (Xinhua News Agency)

Dujiangyan Annual Repair Project Starts; More Than 30,000 Workers Actively Participate

Xinhua News Agency – The famous water conservancy project, Dujiangyan, which irrigates more than 3 million mu of farmland in 15 counties and cities in the Sichuan Plain, began its annual repair in early December of last year. The scale of the Dujiangyan annual repair projects in the winter of the previous year and the spring of last year was equal to the sum of the annual repair projects in the ten years before liberation. As a result of that annual repair, farmers in the Dujiangyan basin harvested more than 80 million jin of rice more than in previous years last autumn. The scale of this annual repair project is 65 percent larger than the previous annual repair. In this way, the farmland in the Dujiangyan basin this year can increase production by another 5 percent based on last year's bumper harvest.

Land reform has been implemented in most areas of the Dujiangyan basin, and the peasants have a high enthusiasm for production and are very active in the annual repair of Dujiangyan. In this annual repair, there are 31,000 workers participating in the construction on the construction sites from Guanxian to Xinjin. Their labor efficiency has more than doubled compared to the past. Now, under the leadership of the water conservancy labor model Luo Chengfu, they have also made a plan to increase production and practice economy. They guarantee to further increase labor efficiency by 20 percent, save administrative expenses by 10 percent, and reduce the consumption of tools and materials by 6 percent. (Xinhua News Agency)

    各地水利建设工程的新进展
    冬季治淮工程大部完工民工劳动效率大为提高
    第二年度冬季治淮工程快要结束了，部分地区已经提前完成或超额完成原定任务。到目前为止，淮河上游河南境内的河道整理工程已全部完工。河南省信阳专区的洪、汝河疏浚工程，在四十天内完成了五百多万立方公尺的土方任务。白沙水库的一道三百四十六公尺长的输水道已经挖通，目前正在浇灌混凝土。板桥水库三百四十公尺长（比原计划延长了三十九公尺）的溢洪道工程也已全部完成。现在这两个水库的土坝正在一天天地加高。中游皖北行政区所属阜阳专区的冬季工程任务已完成百分之九十七，占全年任务的百分之三十五。六安专区的上极堤、正南淮堤、霍邱民生堤的复堤工程和蒋坡塘培堤工程，以及东淝河排水引河等工程都已完成预定任务。下游苏北灌溉总渠的冬季工程也快完成了，其中盐城专区到去年十二月二十三日止，在三十多天时间内，就挖掘了一千六百多万立方公尺的土方，提前并超额完成了冬季的工程任务。
    去年冬季的治淮工程是紧紧地结合着增产节约运动进行的。各地民工相当普遍地掀起了爱国主义的劳动竞赛运动。如在五河附近参加漴、潼河疏浚工程的怀远县民工总队，有近七百个民工小队参加了劳动竞赛，占全总队的民工小队百分之五十以上。上游修建白沙水库的郊县民工总队和禹县民工总队的民工们也互相挑战应战。苏北盐城专区三十万民工全都卷入了这个运动。皖北特等治淮模范金秀兰领导的分队和苏北泰州专区高邮县车逻大队丁广富中队丁广富小组等，向皖北、苏北民工发起的挑战竞赛，对推进这个运动，曾起了很大的作用。
    许多地区的冬季工程是很艰巨的，但由于展开了爱国主义劳动竞赛运动，困难都被民工们一一克服。如苏北灌溉总渠工程中，泰州专区高邮总队民工所在工地的地势低洼，渗水现象严重；但是民工们在雪后零下三度的严寒中突击挖好排水的龙沟，克服了渗水的困难。又如在皖北峰山切岭工程中，民工们遇到坚硬的砂礓，他们终于用勤劳的双手和坚强的意志征服了这些砂礓。
    在爱国主义劳动竞赛中，民工们知道了劳动竞赛不是“拚力气”，都能积极开动脑筋，想办法提高劳动效率。如苏北灌溉总渠工地上的民工，为提高劳动效率，提出了“三齐”的口号，就是每个民工队要做到人齐、心齐和工具齐。这样，加上工地的供应工作、卫生工作和工程技术指导工作都作得好，工人又提高了抽水机的抽水效率，整个工地上的民工每人每天所做的土方比过去多了半公方。有些民工每天能做五公方土，最多的一天做七点八公方。怀远县治淮总队的民工提出：“爱国比行动，工程比标准，劳动比技术，工具比改进，团结比互助”等“十三比”的口号，大大启发了民工们的创造性，提高了工作效率。民工常好元改进了“挖稀泥”的办法（把稀泥挖起晒干后再抬走）后，把劳动效率提高了三分之一。泗县金秀兰分队创造了“分排挖土法”，使每天每抬的抬土效率增加了二十多筐。参加上游白沙水库修建工程的河南禹县第四大队第十五中队的民工，成立了“诸葛亮小组”（技术研究小组），改进工作方法，使原来要求二十天完成的工程，在十七天内就完成了。另外，阜阳专区颍上县民工在实行包方制后，劳动效率由原来每人每天做一点八公方，提高到每人每天做二点五公方。皖北区五河县民工总队（共有四万民工）改进了对治淮民工的供应工作，使五河民工总队成天忙于领粮、买菜等杂务的一千多民工，得以全部投入挖土工作。这样，在这次冬修中就可多做十四万八千多公方的土方工作。
    目前，除上游白沙、板桥两个水库工程和中游部分地区的疏浚整理工程仍在继续进行外，其余工程都快要完工；民工们已开始陆续复员。各地治淮机构，即将总结工作，为今年春季治淮工程进一步做准备。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（综合）
    黄河减凌分水工程修成利津等县解除凌汛威胁
    山东省黄河下游的减凌分水工程，经两个月的兴修，已在去年十二月五日全部完成。今后，黄河的尾闾利津、垦利一段，再不会因凌汛决口成灾了。这一工程包括一个溢水堰和一条新引河。黄河入海处如果因冰凌壅塞，河水难排，就可打开溢水堰的节制闸，把河水从新引河放入黄河故道入海。溢水堰在黄河南岸利津县小街子村北的黄河大堤上，全堰长二百公尺，高十二公尺。堰身中间留着一道三十八公尺宽的放水缺口，缺口上设有节制闸。新引河是从溢水堰的缺口起，到利津县东张庄和小宁海村之间入黄河故道，长约十七公里。引河两岸还筑有两道新堤，共长四十多公里。新引河两岸两道新堤中间有六十九个小村庄，这些村庄周围，都筑有护庄围埝。此外，利津、垦利两县的黄河旧堤，这次也培修了一下。除溢水堰外，全部工程的土工共二百五十四万多公方。参加修建这项工程的技术人员和民工共七万人。
    黄河入海的一段河道狭窄，滩多水浅，每年冬季最易积冰。春季黄河开始解冻时，滨海地区因气候较冷，解冻较迟。上游拥来的冰凌一壅塞，河水不能宣泄，便要决口成灾。为解除利津一带人民每年所受的凌汛威胁，去年春天，山东省人民政府便决定修建这项工程。修工期内，许多民工，曾在摄氏零下九度的严寒中，破冰下水，积极劳动，表现了高度的建设热情。
    减凌分水工程修成后，不但黄河凌汛对利津、垦利等县的威胁解除了，每年桃汛期间，引河还可放水灌溉约四十万亩农田；滨海的一片不毛之地将变成一片肥沃的良田；滨海缺水地区人民的吃水问题也解决了。　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
    都江堰岁修工程开工三万多民工积极参加
    灌溉川西平原十五县市三百多万亩农田的著名水利工程——都江堰，已在去年十二月初开始岁修。前年冬天和去年春天都江堰岁修工程的规模等于解放前十年岁修工程的总和。那次岁修的结果，使去年秋天都江堰流域的农民比往年多收获了八千多万斤稻谷。这次岁修工程的规模比上次岁修又大了百分之六十五。这样，可使今年都江堰流域的农田，在去年丰收的基础上再增产百分之五。
    都江堰流域大部地区已实行了土地改革，农民生产热情很高，对于都江堰的岁修很积极。这次岁修，从灌县到新津一线的工地上，修工的民工共三万一千多人。他们的劳动效率比过去提高一倍以上。现在，他们在水利劳动模范骆成福的带头下，又订了一个增产节约的计划。他们保证要把劳动效率再提高百分之二十；要节省事务费百分之十；还要减低工具、材料消耗量百分之六。　（新华社）
