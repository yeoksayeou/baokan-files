    Universally Inspect the Work of Preferential Treatment Around the Spring Festival
    Universally inspecting the work of preferential treatment and launching a movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs around the upcoming Spring Festival is an important political task. The Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulated in the "Resolution on the Work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea": "Strengthen the work of giving preferential treatment to families of military personnel and families of martyrs." Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, emphasized in the "Report on the Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend the Home and the Country" that it is necessary to
    "Strengthen the work of giving preferential treatment to families of military personnel and families of martyrs. Party and government organs and people's organizations at all levels must always pay close attention to the leadership of this work, constantly check it, and effectively ensure the implementation of preferential treatment plans. We propose that around the Spring Festival next year, all parts of the country conduct another universal inspection of the work of preferential treatment and, based on the jurisdiction of grassroots political power, formulate specific plans for the work of preferential treatment for next year." All localities must earnestly implement this political task.
    In the past year, thanks to the joint efforts of people's governments at all levels, democratic parties, people's organizations, and the people of the whole country, the work of preferential treatment has achieved great success. The people of the whole country have demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, helping the families of revolutionary martyrs and the families of revolutionary military personnel solve difficulties in life and production. Participating in the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families has gradually become a new social trend. Families of martyrs, families of military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers have received the people's love and care politically and various preferential treatments and assistance economically. In rural areas, the work of plowing fields on behalf of families of martyrs and families of military personnel has been significantly improved; the fixed system of plowing fields on behalf of families has been established in 80 percent of the villages in the old revolutionary base areas, and it is being gradually promoted in the new areas. The work of preferential treatment in cities mainly involves organizing families of martyrs and families of military personnel to participate in production and introducing them to jobs, which has also achieved great success in the past year. The understanding of the work of preferential treatment among cadres and the masses in many places has been significantly improved, and they have incorporated doing a good job in preferential treatment into patriotic covenants as a practical action to participate in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Experience in various localities has proven that doing a good job in preferential treatment plays an important role in consolidating and strengthening the people's army, strengthening national defense construction, and raising the people's political awareness. In order to do the work of preferential treatment better, overcome the shortcomings currently existing in the work of preferential treatment, and solve the problems existing in the work of preferential treatment in some areas, it is very necessary for all localities to conduct a universal inspection of the work of preferential treatment around the Spring Festival.
    The inspection of the work of preferential treatment should focus on whether the people's governments at all levels have deviations in leading the work of preferential treatment and implementing the preferential treatment regulations, whether there is any deduction or misappropriation of preferential treatment funds, and whether there are any situations of delayed or inappropriate distribution. Some places have already developed a blind complacency in the work of preferential treatment, satisfied with the achievements they have made and not seeking improvement, which urgently needs to be corrected. Some places adopt a bureaucratic attitude towards the work of preferential treatment, passing on the instructions from higher levels layer by layer, only assigning tasks to lower levels, without urging or checking, resulting in the work of preferential treatment becoming nominal. This phenomenon is not allowed to continue to exist, and it must be thoroughly investigated in this inspection, and improvement measures must be formulated so that the work of preferential treatment can be effectively implemented in these areas.
    The provisions in the preferential treatment regulations regarding the priority rights of families of martyrs, families of military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers in production, employment, grain loans, loans, children's enrollment, and medical treatment must be effectively realized through this inspection. Because this is the political honor and right they should enjoy from the state, and it is an important measure to comprehensively develop the work of preferential treatment and make it regular. Neglecting this work means depriving the families of martyrs, families of military personnel, and honored military personnel of the political rights they should enjoy, which is not allowed. Therefore, all banks, schools, health institutions, state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and other social undertakings and organizations should first and foremost earnestly implement these provisions in the preferential treatment regulations. Experience in various localities has proven that where attention is paid to implementing the preferential treatment regulations and specific implementation measures are formulated and implemented, the work of preferential treatment is done well, and the families of martyrs and families of military personnel feel satisfied and honored. Although some places have also issued instructions, the leading organs do not have enough understanding of the political significance of the work of preferential treatment, lack regular inspection of the work of preferential treatment, and do not earnestly implement the preferential treatment regulations; some places even refuse to grant grain loans in the work of grain loans because they fear that the poor families of martyrs and families of military personnel will not be able to repay them, not only failing to give priority to their needs but also depriving them of their due rights. In this way, the work of preferential treatment cannot be done well, and it will cause dissatisfaction among the families of martyrs and families of military personnel. This must be earnestly corrected in this inspection.
    In rural areas, the focus should be on inspecting the work of plowing fields on behalf of families, and in cities, the focus should be on the employment and production of families of martyrs and families of military personnel. Regarding the work of plowing fields on behalf of families, the inspection should pay attention to whether there are any deviations in which the scope of preferential treatment is too broad, or the plowing is not being done on behalf of families that should be entitled to it. In newly liberated areas, it is necessary to strengthen preferential treatment education for the masses and promote the method of fixed plowing on behalf of families; in old revolutionary base areas, attention should also be paid to appropriately adjusting the phenomenon of excessively light or heavy labor burdens on the masses in some areas due to the excessive number of families of martyrs and families of military personnel. In the work of plowing fields on behalf of families, increasing the land yield and increasing the application of fertilizer for the families of martyrs and families of military personnel are the focus of inspection. Appropriate commendations should be given to models of preferential treatment for families of martyrs and families of military personnel, models of plowing on behalf of families, and models of families of martyrs, families of military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, and the masses should be called upon to learn from them. Those who do not do a good job of plowing on behalf of families should be given criticism and education. In the work of preferential treatment in cities, deviations and shortcomings in organizing the production and employment of families of martyrs and families of military personnel should be inspected. Overcome the practice of only paying attention to material subsidies and not actively organizing their production; criticize the erroneous thinking of being eager for quick success, engaging in large-scale production, and disliking small-scale production and temporary sideline production; and promote the production methods that are simple, easy to learn, and can be combined with family production.
    Carrying out in-depth inspection is an important method of leading and promoting the work of preferential treatment. Therefore, the process of inspection is the process of mobilizing the masses and educating the masses to do a good job in the work of preferential treatment. Past experience has proven that in order to make the inspection work effective, it is necessary to: First, party and government leading cadres should first pay attention to the inspection of the work of preferential treatment, convene various cadre meetings to conduct ideological education, and then carry out mass inspections through various mass organizations. This is the only way to make the inspection work universally carried out. Second, convene representative meetings or symposiums of families of martyrs, families of military personnel, revolutionary disabled soldiers, models of plowing on behalf of families, and models of preferential treatment at the special district, county (city), district, and township levels. This kind of meeting is of great benefit to educating families of martyrs and families of military personnel, strengthening the connection between the masses and the government, listening to and absorbing the opinions of the masses on the work of preferential treatment, and improving the work of preferential treatment. Third, convene cadre meetings or mass meetings in districts, townships (villages), streets, lanes, factories, schools, and organs to conduct patriotic education and education on preferential treatment policies, and enlighten the masses to pay attention to the work of preferential treatment, so as to discover the problems existing in the work of preferential treatment and solve them. This is an effective way to fully and deeply mobilize the masses. Fourth, people's governments at all levels should universally organize inspection teams or consolation groups to go deep into rural areas, hospitals, etc. to conduct consolation or typical investigations of the work of preferential treatment. Fifth, convene support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-families work committees at all levels to mobilize the masses to conduct universal inspection. These methods are all very good, and all localities should adopt them separately according to their local conditions in the inspection work.
    After discovering problems in the inspection, in order to ensure that the problems are effectively solved, it is necessary to mobilize the masses, come up with practical and feasible methods, and incorporate them into patriotic covenants. Only by mobilizing the masses to formulate plans for the work of preferential treatment can the effectiveness of the work of preferential treatment be improved and the work of preferential treatment be comprehensively promoted. Therefore, along with the progress of the inspection work, all localities should formulate a plan for the work of preferential treatment for 1952 based on the jurisdiction of grassroots political power. The plan must be practical. Whether the plan is practical or not has a great relationship to the success of the work of preferential treatment. Only by formulating an accurate plan can the work of preferential treatment in 1952 be further improved.
    Around the Spring Festival, all localities should universally mobilize the masses to comfort the families of martyrs, families of military personnel, the sick and wounded, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, but attention must be paid to frugality and preventing extravagance and waste. Through consolation and inspection, everyone should respect the Chinese People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army, and everyone should respect the families of martyrs, families of military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers.

### 春节前后普遍检查优抚工作

    春节前后普遍检查优抚工作
    在即将到来的春节前后，普遍检查优抚工作，开展拥军优属运动，是一项重要的政治任务。人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议在“关于抗美援朝工作的决议”中规定：“加强优待军人家属，烈士家属的工作”。抗美援朝总会彭真副主席在“关于抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告”中，更强调指出，必须
    “加强优待军人家属、烈士家属的工作。各级党政机关和人民团体对于这一工作，必须经常抓紧领导，并不断加以检查，切实保证优抚计划的执行。我们提议在明年春节前后全国各地对优抚工作再进行一次普遍的检查，并以基层政权的辖区为单位，订出明年优抚工作的具体计划。”各地对这一政治任务必须认真贯彻执行。
    过去一年来，由于各级人民政府、各民主党派、各人民团体和全国人民的共同努力，优抚工作获得了很大的成绩。全国人民在抗美援朝运动中，发挥了高度的革命热情，帮助革命烈士家属、革命军人家属解决生活和生产中的困难。参加拥军优属工作已经逐渐成为新的社会风尚。烈士家属、军人家属和革命残废军人，在政治上得到人民的爱戴和关怀，经济上得到各种优待和扶助。在农村中，为烈士家属、军人家属代耕的工作，有了显著的改进；固定代耕制度，在老根据地已有百分之八十的村庄建立起来，在新区也在逐步推广。城市的优抚工作，主要是组织烈士家属、军人家属参加生产和替他们介绍职业，一年来也获得了很大的成绩。许多地方的干部和群众，对优抚工作的认识，已有显著提高，纷纷把做好优抚工作订入爱国公约，作为自己参加抗美援朝运动的一项实际行动。各地经验证明，作好优抚工作，对于巩固和加强人民军队，加强国防建设，以及提高人民的政治认识，都有重要的作用。为了把优抚工作做得更好，克服目前优抚工作中存在的缺点，解决某些地区在优抚工作中所存在的问题，各地在春节前后对优抚工作作一次普遍的检查，是十分必要的。
    对于优抚工作的检查，应该着重在各级人民政府对优抚工作的领导和执行优抚条例有无偏向，对优抚事业费有无扣压或挪用，以及迟发或发得不当等情形。有些地方在优抚工作中已经滋生了满足于既得成绩，不求改进的盲目自满情绪，亟须加以纠正。有些地方对优抚工作采取官僚主义态度，把上级的指示一层一层往下传，只向下面交代任务，既不督促，又不检查，致优抚工作变成有名无实。这种现象是不容许继续存在的，在这次检查中必须把它彻底检查出来，订出改进办法，使优抚工作在这些地区切实贯彻执行。
    在优抚条例中，对于烈士家属、军人家属和革命残废军人在生产、就业、贷粮、贷款、子女入学、疾病治疗等方面的优先权的规定，必须通过这次检查，切实予以实现。因为这是国家给予他们的应享的政治荣誉和权利，是使优抚工作全面开展，并使之经常化的重要措施。如果忽视这些工作，就是剥夺烈士家属、军人家属和荣誉军人应享的政治权利，这是不能允许的。因此，一切银行、学校、卫生机关、公营企业、合作社以及其他社会事业机关团体，首先应该切实执行优抚条例上的这些规定。各地经验证明，凡注意执行优抚条例，并订出具体实施办法加以贯彻执行的地方，优抚工作就做得有成绩，烈士家属、军人家属都感到满意和光荣。有些地方虽然也下过指示，但由于领导机关对优抚工作的政治意义认识不够，对优抚工作缺乏经常检查，没有认真执行优抚条例；有的地方甚至在贷粮贷款工作中，因怕贫苦的烈士家属、军人家属无法偿还而不愿贷给，不但未能给予优先照顾，反而剥夺其应有的权利。这样，优抚工作就做不好，而招致烈士家属、军人家属的不满。在这次检查中，必须认真纠正。
    在农村中要着重检查代耕工作，在城市中应着重烈士家属、军人家属的就业与生产问题。关于代耕工作，检查中要注意有无优待面过宽，或应代耕而没有代耕的偏向。新解放区要加强对群众的优抚教育，推行固定代耕的办法；老根据地还要注意适当调整某些地区因烈士家属、军人家属过多，群众劳力负担上畸轻畸重的现象。代耕工作中，提高烈士家属、军人家属的土地产量和增施肥料，是检查的重点。对于优待烈士家属、军人家属的模范，代耕模范，烈士家属、军人家属和革命残废军人的模范，要给予适当的表扬，号召群众向他们学习。对于因代耕不好的，要给予批评教育。在城市优抚工作中，要检查组织烈士家属、军人家属生产就业工作中的偏差和缺点。克服那种只注意实物补助，不积极组织他们生产的作法；批判那种急于求成，搞大生产，嫌小生产和临时副业生产的错误思想；提倡那种简便易学、能与家庭生产相结合的生产方式。
    深入进行检查，是领导和推动优抚工作的一个重要方法。因此检查的过程，就是发动群众、教育群众做好优抚工作的过程。过去经验证明，为使检查工作有效地进行，必须：第一、党政领导干部首先应重视优抚工作的检查，召开各种干部会议进行思想教育，然后通过各种群众组织开展群众性的大检查。这样才能使检查工作普遍开展。第二、分别召开专区、县（市）、区、乡的烈士家属、军人家属、革命残废军人、代耕模范、优抚模范的代表会议或座谈会。这种会议对于教育烈士家属、军人家属，加强群众与政府的联系，听取和吸收群众对优抚工作的意见，改进优抚工作，有很大好处。第三、以区、乡（村）、街道、里弄、工厂、学校、机关为单位，召开干部会或群众大会，进行爱国主义教育和优抚政策的教育，启发群众对优抚工作的重视，从而发现优抚工作中所存在的问题加以解决。这是全面深入发动群众的有效方式。第四、各级人民政府普遍组织检查组或慰问团，深入到乡村、医院等进行慰问或作优抚工作的典型调查。第五、逐级召开拥军优属工作委员会，发动群众普遍检查。这些方法都是很好的，各地在检查工作中，应根据当地实际情况，分别采用。
    在检查中发现问题之后，为使问题得到切实的解决，必须发动群众，想出切实可行的办法，订入爱国公约。只有动员群众订立优抚工作计划才能提高优抚工作效能，全面推进优抚工作。因此，随着检查工作的进行，各地应以基层政权的辖区为单位，订出一九五二年的优抚工作计划。计划必须切合实际。计划的切实与否，对于优抚工作成绩的好坏，有很大的关系。只有订了准确的计划，才能使一九五二年的优抚工作进一步提高。
    春节前后各地要普遍发动群众慰劳烈士家属、军人家属、伤病员、革命残废军人，但须注意节约，防止铺张浪费。通过慰问和检查，使人人尊敬人民志愿军和人民解放军，人人尊敬烈士家属、军人家属和革命残废军人。
