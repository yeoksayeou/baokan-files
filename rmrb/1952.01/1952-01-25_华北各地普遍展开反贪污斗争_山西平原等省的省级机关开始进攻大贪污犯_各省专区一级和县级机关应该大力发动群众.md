    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has universally unfolded across North China. Organs and organizations at the provincial, municipal, and special district levels have fully entered a high tide of confession, accusation, and exposure. County-level organs and organizations have also begun to take action. Simultaneously, industrial and commercial circles in cities such as Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, and Baoding have launched a movement against bribery, tax evasion, fraud, theft of economic intelligence, and shoddy workmanship.

    The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in North China generally began in mid-December of last year. Since New Year's Day this year, localities have implemented the policy of leaders taking responsibility, leading at each level, setting time limits for mobilizing the masses, and investigating corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The mass confession and accusation movement has developed extremely rapidly.

    During the confession and accusation movement, localities promptly announced the policy of lenient treatment for those who confess and severe punishment for those who refuse to confess, encouraging many people with unclean hands to actively confess and actively collect materials to accuse others. Zhang Jie, an accountant at the Hebei Province Shijiazhuang Special District Water Conservancy Promotion Society, after confessing his own corrupt acts, exposed a major corruption case involving forty-two manufacturers colluding with personnel of the society to steal ninety million yuan of state property. Major cases of corruption and waste continue to be exposed. The vast majority of these cases are inseparable from the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie. In Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, the Huimin Store alone bribed and bought off thirty-four staff members in nineteen organs and enterprises to jointly steal state property. Li Yunzhang, head of the engineering section of a certain tannery factory in Zhangjiakou, Chahar Province, accepted bribes of 150 million yuan from private merchants when purchasing materials in Shanghai, causing a loss of one billion yuan in state funds. From these exposed facts, leading organs in various localities clearly recognized the importance of simultaneously launching movements against bribery, tax evasion, fraud, theft of secrets, and disruption in industrial and commercial circles. Now, industrial and commercial circles in Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Xuanhua, Datong, and other cities have established production increase and economy inspection committees to lead the development of the movement. Promoting the anti-bribery movement in industrial and commercial circles directly promoted the in-depth development of the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement in organs and organizations, making it difficult for stubborn major corrupt elements to escape the law.

    At present, the progress of the movement in the entire region is still very uneven. Provincial organs in Shanxi, Pingyuan, and other provinces have begun a full-scale attack on major corrupt elements. However, in various provinces, especially at the special district level, there are still many units where either confession and accusation are underway, or the leadership is dragging its feet and the masses have not yet been mobilized. A few advanced counties have now begun to enter democratic inspection, while most are still in the process of deliberation and mobilization. Therefore, the serious task of the provincial leading organs at present is to strive for balanced development of the movement. In general, provincial leading organs plan to draw out strength from February to help county-level organs deeply develop the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, in order to achieve the effects of popularization and depth in a relatively short period.

    华北各地普遍展开反贪污斗争
    山西平原等省的省级机关开始进攻大贪污犯
    各省专区一级和县级机关应该大力发动群众
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动已在华北各地普遍展开，省、省辖市、专区各级机关、团体已全面进入坦白、检举、揭发的高潮，县级机关、团体也已开始行动。同时，太原、张家口、石家庄、唐山、保定等市工商界开展了反行贿、反偷漏、反盗骗、反盗窃经济情报、反偷工减料的运动。
    华北各地的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动一般都是在去年十二月中旬开始的。今年元旦以来，各地执行了首长负责，层层带头，限期发动群众，清查贪污浪费与官僚主义的方针，群众性的坦白检举运动极其迅速地开展起来了。
    在坦白检举运动中，各地都及时地宣布了对坦白者从轻处理、对拒不坦白者严重惩办的政策，使许多手脚不干净的人踊跃坦白，并积极搜集材料检举别人。河北省石家庄专区水利推进社会计张杰在坦白了自己的贪污行为后，揭发了四十二家厂商与该社人员勾结盗窃国家财产达九千万元的大贪污案。重大的贪污浪费案件也不断地被揭发出来。这些案件绝大多数是和资产阶级的猖狂进攻分不开的。山西省太原市仅惠民商店一家，即以行贿、收买等方法勾引了十九个机关、企业中的三十四个工作人员，共同盗窃国家财产。察哈尔省张家口某部制皮厂工务股股长李蕴章，在上海采买物资时，自己接受私商贿赂一亿五千万元，竟使国家资金损失达十亿元。从这些已被揭发的事实中，各地领导机关明确认识到同时在工商界开展反行贿、反偷漏、反盗骗、反盗密、反扰乱运动的重要意义。现在太原、张家口、唐山、石家庄、保定、宣化、大同等城市工商界已成立了增产节约检查委员会，领导运动的开展。在工商界推进反行贿等运动，就直接推动了机关、团体的反贪污、反浪费运动的深入发展，使执迷不悟的大贪污分子难逃法网。
    目前全区运动的进展还很不平衡。山西、平原等省的省级机关已开始对大贪污犯展开全面进攻。但各省特别是专区一级还有不少单位，有的是正在进行检举坦白，也有的是领导方面拖拖拉拉，群众尚未发动起来。少数先进县现已开始进入民主检查，大部分还在进行酝酿、动员。因此，目前省领导机关的严重任务是争取运动平衡发展。一般省领导机关并预定从二月份开始，抽出力量，帮助县级机关深入开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，以便争取在较短时期内收到普及和深入的效果。
