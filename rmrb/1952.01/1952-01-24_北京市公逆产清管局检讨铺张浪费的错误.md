    Beijing Municipal Public Enemy Property Management Bureau Conducts Self-Criticism for Extravagance and Waste Errors

    To the Editor: The criticism made by Comrade Zhifeng in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on January 10, 1952, regarding the extravagance and waste of this bureau's construction office and the former Kyoto Public Trading Company is correct. We fully accept Comrade Zhifeng's suggestions.

    Kyoto Public Trading Company's banquets and dinners and treating cadres to "Peking duck," and giving gifts to the bureau director and section chiefs during the New Year cost a total of 7,136,050 yuan. Among these, 440,000 yuan was spent on gifts. The head of the responsible section, Zhang Menghua, fearing that the expenses could not be reimbursed after being criticized by a certain director of the bureau, used false receipts to cover the expenses under the travel expenses item. This was a serious mistake. As for the handling of leftover materials in the warehouse and treating cadres within the organization to "Peking duck," these were specific manifestations of a lack of organization and discipline, and are also serious errors. Regarding the waste in the construction office, it was indeed quite serious. Just the dinner party held to celebrate the completion of the workers' dormitory and the New Year, which combined to invite technical personnel, workers, and cadres of the bureau, cost 5,233,250 yuan. The above facts are only part of this bureau's examination of extravagance and waste. Although several large-scale dinners were approved by the leadership, we should still bear the main responsibility. As for the use of false receipts and unauthorized spending, the head of the responsible section, Zhang Menghua, has made a deep self-criticism and requested punishment.

    北京市公逆产清管局检讨铺张浪费的错误
    编辑同志：一九五二年一月十日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载的志凤同志对本局建筑事务所及原属本局的京都公易行铺张浪费的批评是正确的。我们完全接受志凤同志的意见。
    京都公易行请客会餐和请干部吃“烤鸭”，给本局局长、处长年节送礼，共用去七百一十三万六千零五十元。其中四十四万元送礼费，主管科长张梦华受到本局某处长批评后怕报不了账，就用了假单据从旅费项下开支了，这个错误是严重的。至于处理仓库所剩零星物资和请行内干部吃“烤鸭”等等，都是无组织无纪律的具体表现，也是严重的错误。关于建筑事务所方面的浪费，确实也相当严重，只就工人宿舍落成后和祝贺新年合并举行的招待技术人员、工人、本局干部的聚餐晚会，就开支了五百二十三万三千二百五十元。上述这些事实，只是本局检查铺张浪费的一部分。几次大规模的聚餐，虽然都是经过领导方面批准的，但我们仍应负主要责任。至于使用假单据和错误的擅自开支，主管科长张梦华已作了深刻检讨，并自请处分。
