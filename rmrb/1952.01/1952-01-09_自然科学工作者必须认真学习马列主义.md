    Natural Science Workers Must Conscientiously Study Marxism-Leninism
    Comrade Editor: I am a young person engaged in natural science research. I believe that, like the people of the whole country, our general natural science workers have made significant progress politically and ideologically through the ideological education of the three major movements. However, many people still cannot completely break away from the influence of European and American bourgeois viewpoints in their stance, viewpoint, and method of scholarship. That is to say, we often rationally acknowledge that science must be subordinate to politics, but our understanding of it only stays at the stage where politics creates research conditions for science and science must be subordinate to political tasks. We have not further recognized the guiding role of Marxism-Leninism in scientific research. Therefore, our understanding of science being subordinate to politics is still half-paralyzed, and we still see political thought and academic research as opposed to each other.

    Taking my own six years of medical education as an example, I inherited the medical viewpoint of European and American bourgeois mechanical materialism, regarding the human body as a biological synthesis of various inorganic organs, but I could not see the dialectical dominant role of nerves, especially the cerebral cortex, and I ignored the corresponding unity of the internal and external environments. In particular, Virchow's morphological pathology made me stubbornly believe that: if a person is sick, there must be corresponding tissue undergoing corresponding morphological changes; if a person is sick, there must be bacteria or pathogenic organisms, and to cure the disease, one must use drugs to act on the pathogen to solve the problem. This view of life as a very mechanical substance without qualitative changes made me complacent, lost my sense of fresh things in science, and fell into the quagmire of dogmatism.

    Because of this, when I participated in the anti-US aggression and aid Korea volunteer surgical medical work, I echoed my professors and superiors, criticizing the Soviet new therapies used by medical officers in the troops, and regarded this new therapy as heresy. This incorrect medical viewpoint made it impossible for me to give a correct understanding of the neurotic functional diseases or sensory diseases suffered by the volunteer army's sick and wounded.

    Natural science workers, because they have not mastered the viewpoint and method of Marxism-Leninism, are not only prone to the above-mentioned errors and deviations, but also prone to forming a mentality of neglecting the precious medical heritage of the motherland. Chairman Mao taught us in "On Practice": "People's knowledge, whether in the natural world or in society, develops step by step from the lower to the higher levels, that is, from the shallow to the deep, from the one-sided to the more comprehensive." This shows that the experience accumulated through thousands of years of practice, that is, China's medical heritage, is constantly being enriched and improved. Taking acupuncture therapy as an example, the preliminary principles that can be explained today are similar to Pavlov's medical thought—the relationship between the brain, nerves, and internal organs and its dominant spirit in the body's function—which is worthy of our further study.

    In short, in today's unfolding movement of ideological remolding of intellectuals, our natural science workers must recognize that natural science is subordinate to politics and subordinate to the correct philosophical thought—dialectical materialism. We must recognize that the great achievements of the various constructions in the Soviet Union, especially the great achievements of scientific construction, are inseparable from the ideological guidance of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, we natural science workers, especially biological science workers, must thoroughly eliminate the decadent bourgeois viewpoints, conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, and study the theories of Pavlov and Michurin. Only in this way can our thinking be further transformed and improved.

### 自然科学工作者必须认真学习马列主义

    开展各种知识分子的思想改造运动
    自然科学工作者必须认真学习马列主义
    编辑同志：我是一个从事自然科学研究工作的青年。我认为，我们一般自然科学工作者和全国人民一样，经过三大运动的思想教育，在政治上和思想上都有了显著的提高。但是，许多人在治学的立场、观点和方法上，仍然不能完全摆脱欧美资产阶级观点的影响。这就是说，我们往往在理性上承认了科学必须服从于政治，但对它的认识却仅仅停留在政治为科学开辟研究的条件和科学要服从于政治任务的阶段上，还没有进一步认识马克思列宁主义对于科学研究的指导作用。所以，我们对于科学服从于政治的认识，还是半身不遂的，还是把政治思想和学术研究对立起来看的。
    用我自己六年来所受医学教育的情况来说，我承袭着欧美资产阶级机械唯物论的医学观点，把人体看作是各种器官无机综合的生物，而看不见神经，尤其是大脑皮质辩证的主宰作用，忽视了内在环境和外在环境相应统一的作用。尤其是维尔肖的形态病理学，使我顽固地认为：人有病就一定有相应的组织发生相应的形态学上的变化，人有病一定就有细菌或致病的生物体，要治病必须用药物作用于致病体，才能解决问题。这种把生命看作无质量互变的非常机械的物质的观点，就使我故步自封，失去了对科学上新鲜事物的感觉，陷入了教条主义的泥淖中了。
    正因为如此，我在参加抗美援朝志愿手术医疗工作时，就曾附和我的教授和上级医师，非难部队医务干部施用苏联新疗法，视这种新疗法为异端。这种不正确的医学观点，使我对于志愿军伤病员所患的神经性机能病或感应性的病症，不能给以正确的认识。
    自然科学工作者由于没有掌握马克思列宁主义的观点和方法，不但易于发生以上所说的错误和偏向，也易形成忽视祖国宝贵医学遗产的心理。毛主席在“实践论”中教导我们：“人们的认识，不论对于自然界方面，对于社会方面，也都是一步又一步地由低级向高级发展，即由浅入深，由片面到更多的方面。”这就说明了，经过数千年实践所积累的经验，即，中国的医学遗产，是不断地在充实和提高着的。以针灸疗法为例，今日已可解释的初步原理，就是和巴甫洛夫医学思想——大脑、神经和内脏相关以及其主宰机体机能的精神相近似的，是值得我们进一步研究的。
    总之，在知识分子思想改造运动正在展开的今天，我们自然科学工作者必须认识自然科学是服从于政治，服从于正确的哲学思想——辩证唯物论的。我们必须认识苏联各项建设的伟大成就，尤其是科学建设的伟大成就，是和马克思列宁主义的思想指导分不开的。因此，我们自然科学工作者，尤其是生物科学工作者，就必须彻底清除腐朽的资产阶级的观点，认真学习马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，研究巴甫洛夫和米邱林的学说。只有如此，才能够使自己的思想获得进一步的改造和提高。
