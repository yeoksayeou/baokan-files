    Self-Criticism of Accepting Gifts from Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan
    Gong Tongxuan
    After the Third Party Congress of Hebei Province exposed the major corruption case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, I have been feeling uneasy because I once accepted "gifts" from Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan. I have made many mistakes. In order to thoroughly liquidate the corruption of bourgeois ideology I have suffered since entering the city, and in order to correct my mistakes in this great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, I hereby express my heartfelt support for the decision of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the CPC to expel Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Party and hand them over to the People's Government for legal action, and make the following self-criticism:
    I. The Facts and Circumstances of My Accepting Gifts
    I have been familiar with Liu and Zhang for a long time, and we used to work together and had good feelings for each other. In the spring of 1950, after I had an operation for illness and was very weak, Liu and Zhang sent me two bottles of Vitamin B and five bottles of Pylatol. I was only grateful to them and did not consider the source of these things. In January 1951, during the Spring Festival holiday, when I went to Tianjin, Liu Qingshan gave me 500,000 yuan in cash, ten rolls of cigarettes, and a thermos. Due to my enjoyment-seeking thoughts, I accepted these things. At that time, I mistakenly thought they were "generous" and took "good" care of comrades. When I was recuperating in Beijing Hospital in February and March, Liu sent me another 2 million yuan. Although I felt ashamed to accept it at the time and returned the original amount, when it was sent again the second time, I, with my strong individualism, could no longer resist such temptation and finally accepted it, and even wrote a reply, once again mistakenly expressing my gratitude. In June, when I arrived in Tianjin, they successively bought me toothpaste, towels, soap, a vest each, a pair of leather sandals, a package of cloth (about ten feet), a "three-no-fear" raincoat, and a gray wool suit. At that time, although I said "no" verbally, I thought, "This is what I need, so I should take it if they give it." Later, at the North China Materials Exchange Exhibition, I exchanged my radium-dial swimming watch for Zhang Zishan's automatic watch. In total, the value of these items amounted to about 7 or 8 million yuan.
    II. My Understanding of My Mistakes
    At the Hebei Provincial Party Congress, I only began to realize that I had made serious mistakes. My mistakes are manifested in: accepting gifts from Liu and Zhang, again and again, repeatedly without realizing it. This is because: since entering the city, especially in the past one or two years, I have been eroded by bourgeois corrupt ideas without realizing it, lost the political acumen that a Party member should have, and never been vigilant about Liu and Zhang's actions. I always saw the side of their past contributions to the revolution, but did not clearly see the side of their degeneration and transformation into betrayal of the Party and the people in the new environment. Therefore, I regarded thieves who stole state property for their own enjoyment in the name of operating "agency production" as good "comrades" with ability, thinking that spending a little "agency production" money did not matter. I mistakenly thought this was a "minor" matter of life, and even mistook their open and public efforts to win people over, bribe, and drag me into the mire and make me sink deeper and deeper as "care," "concern," and good feelings for me. Therefore, I could not launch a serious and irreconcilable struggle against their corruption and report it to the Party organization. In order to correct my mistakes, I have written a written self-criticism to the Provincial Party Committee, asking the Party to give me the necessary punishment.
    III. The Root Causes of My Mistakes
    Why did I make such a big mistake? The main reason is that I come from a petty-bourgeois background, and I have serious selfish, self-interested, and individualistic thoughts. I only care about my own enjoyment and ignore the losses of the country and the people, thus indirectly stealing a large amount of state property from Liu and Zhang. Secondly, it is personal heroism, vanity, and concern for face. Although I have been nurtured and educated by the Party for many years and have gone through many struggles, due to my lack of humility, my progress has been very slow, so that my selfish and self-interested consciousness has not been transformed as it should have been. It was not until the Provincial Party Congress exposed the crimes of the big embezzlers Liu and Zhang that it sounded the alarm for me. Thirdly, my studies are very poor, I am careless and superficial, and I do not seek thorough understanding. Therefore, I have not truly understood what Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us about strictly guarding against the erosion of bourgeois ideology.
    In the future, I am determined to more deeply examine myself in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and resolutely draw a clear line with bourgeois ideology. I hope that more comrades will help educate me, thoroughly transform my bad thoughts and bad work style, and eliminate all non-proletarian ideological consciousness.

### 检讨我接受刘青山、张子善礼物的错误

    检讨我接受刘青山、张子善礼物的错误
    弓彤轩
    河北省党的第三次代表会议揭发了刘青山、张子善的大贪污案后，我总在忐忑不安，因为我曾接受了刘青山、张子善的“礼物”，我是有很多错误的。为了彻底清算自己入城以来所受资产阶级思想的腐蚀，为了在正在开展着的反贪污反浪费反官僚主义这一伟大斗争中改正自己的错误，我在这里除表明衷心拥护中共河北省委开除刘青山、张子善党籍的决议并把他们送交人民政府法办以外，特作如下检讨：
    一、我接受礼物的事实和经过
    我很早就和刘、张二人熟悉，过去曾在一起工作，感情较好。一九五○年春，自己因病动手术后身体很弱，刘、张就给我送来维他命B两瓶、拍拉托五瓶，自己只是感激他们，未曾考虑他们这些东西的来源。一九五一年一月春节放假期间，我去天津时，刘青山又送给我现款五十万元，烟十筒、暖水壶一个。由于自己的享受思想作祟，又接受了这些东西。当时还错误地认为他们“大方”，对同志照顾“周到”。二三月间我在北京医院休养时，刘又给我送来二百万元，当时虽感到受之有愧，将原款退回，但第二次又送来时，存有浓厚的个人主义思想的我，再也经不起这样的引诱而终于接受了，并且还写了回条，又一次错误地表示谢意。六月间，我到了天津，他们又陆续给我买来牙膏、手巾、香皂、背心各一，皮凉鞋一双、布一包（约十丈左右）、“三不怕”的雨衣一件、灰毛服装一身，当时虽然口头上说“不要”，但心想：“这是我需要的，给就要。”后来在华北物资交流展览会上，又以自己的夜光游泳表换了张子善的自动手表一只。总计以上这些东西合计约达七、八百万元之巨。
    二、我对自己的错误的认识
    在河北省党代表会议上，我才初步地认识到自己是犯有严重错误的。我的错误表现在：从刘、张手中接受礼物，一而再，再而三，屡犯而不自觉。这是因为：我自进城后特别是近一二年来受了资产阶级腐化思想的侵蚀而不觉悟，丧失了党员应有的政治嗅觉，对刘、张的行径从未加以警惕。总是看到他们过去对革命的贡献的一面，而没有清楚地看到他们在新的环境下所暴露出来的叛党叛人民的这种堕落蜕化行为的一面，因而把以经营“机关生产”为名以盗窃国家资财供己享受为实的盗贼，竟看成是好“同志”，有能力，花点“机关生产”款不算什么，错误地认为这是生活“小节”，甚至将其公开上下拉拢、行贿，将自己拉入泥坑并越陷越深而误认是对自己的“关心”、“照顾”和感情不错，因此自己就不能对他们的贪污行为展开严肃的不调和的斗争，并向党的组织上反映。为了纠正自己的错误，我已向省委写了书面检讨，要求党给我以必要的处分。
    三、我的错误根由
    我为什么会犯这样大的错误呢？主要是由于自己是小资产阶级出身，本身存在着严重的自私自利、个人主义思想，只顾自己享受，不顾国家人民的损失，因而从刘、张手中间接盗窃了大批国家资财。其次是个人英雄主义，虚荣心、爱面子，虽经党培养教育多年，并经过不少斗争，由于自己的不虚心，进步很慢，以致自私自利的意识没有得到应有的改造，直到省党代表会议揭发了大贪污犯刘、张的罪行之后，才给我敲了警钟。第三是学习很差，粗枝大叶，不求甚解，因而对毛主席所再三教导我们严防资产阶级思想侵蚀的话，没有真正认识。
    今后我决心在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，更深刻地检讨自己，坚决和资产阶级的思想划清界限。希望更多的同志帮助教育我，彻底改造自己的坏思想坏作风，肃清一切非无产阶级的思想意识。
