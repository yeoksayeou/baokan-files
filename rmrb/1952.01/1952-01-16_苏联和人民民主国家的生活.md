    Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Soviet State Literature Publishing House's Publishing Plan for This Year
    The Soviet State Literature Publishing House plans to publish 44 million books in 1952. In the publication of Russian classical literature, Gogol's works occupy an important position, with 4 million copies planned for publication. In addition, collections of works by Goncharov and Uspensky will be published. Regarding the publication of works by Soviet writers, collections of works by Pavlenko, Bazhov, Ehrenburg, Fedin, and others are scheduled for publication. Furthermore, it is planned to further strengthen the introduction of works by writers from People's Democratic countries in 1952, and will publish a collection of stories by famous Chinese writers, a one-volume collection of Lu Xun's works, a selection of Guo Moruo's works, a collection of Bulgarian novels, a collection of Hungarian stories, a collection of Romanian short stories, a collection of modern Polish poetry, and a collection of poetry from the German Democratic Republic.
    Vietnamese Farmers Enthusiastically Pay Agricultural Tax
    In order to unify rural taxation, reduce the burden on the vast number of farmers, and ensure the supply of military grain for the war of resistance, the Vietnamese People's Government promulgated a decree on the collection of agricultural tax in May 1951. This tax is levied according to the ratio of the harvest, and the tax amount shall not exceed 25% of the harvest. In the event of natural disasters or enemy destruction, the tax may be reduced or exempted as appropriate. The government provides preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers, as well as tenant farmers who are unable to pay taxes. Newly cultivated land may be exempted from taxes for three to five years, and state-owned and private experimental farms and farmers with poor harvests are permitted to be exempted from taxes by the government. In order to take care of hired laborers and poor farmers, the government reserves 10% of the quotas in each village for exemption from agricultural tax, so that farmers can apply. Because the Vietnamese People's Government cares about the vital interests of farmers, this decree on the collection of agricultural tax has been warmly supported by farmers.
    Currently, a patriotic competition to pay agricultural tax is underway throughout Vietnam. Competition has developed between villages and between families. Everyone strives to select the best, cleanest, and driest rice to pay to the local tax authorities at all levels. During the agricultural tax payment period, young people organized service teams to help farmers who lack labor to carry and deliver tax rice. On the road to the government warehouse, children and local art troupes organized "rest stops," preparing tea and various song and dance programs to receive taxpayers. Teachers and students in schools voluntarily went to work at government tax collection stations, or helped with weighing and accounting. Farmers flocked to the tax collection stations from all directions, turning the tax collection stations into lively meeting places. This is not only the case in the liberated areas, but patriotic people in the enemy-occupied areas often risk carrying rice in the middle of the night, crossing enemy watch posts, and arriving in the liberated areas to pay agricultural tax.
    Martyrs' Children and Orphans in Korea Receive Warm Care
    In order to ensure that the martyrs' children and orphans in the orphanage in a certain county in Korea are well-fed and warm in the cold winter, the county People's Committee specially sent them more than 150 kilograms of cotton, 5 tons of radishes, more than 40 tons of coal, a cattle cart, and a cow. The local people also often give them assistance, and at the end of last year, they sent more than 30 bags of rice and more than 130 zhang of cloth. The orphanage also received 135 zhang of cotton cloth and more than 1,000 kilograms of cotton sent by the people of the People's Democratic countries. Therefore, the children were able to wear warm clothes to spend the winter.
    When the New Year came, women from all over rushed to make new clothes, cotton socks, embroidered shoes, and snacks for the martyrs' children and orphans. Among the New Year gifts sent by the Democratic Women's League of Beiqing Township, Beiqing County, South Hamgyong Province, to the orphans, there were more than 270 new sets of clothes.

    苏联和人民民主国家的生活

    越南农民踊跃缴纳农业税
    越南人民政府为了要统一农村税收，减轻广大农民负担，保证抗战军粮的供应，于一九五一年五月间颁布了征收农业税的法令。这种税是按收获量的比率而征收的，税额不得超过收获量的百分之二十五，若遇天灾或敌人的破坏，可酌量减纳或免除。对烈士和军人家属以及无力纳税的佃农，政府予以优待。对于新开垦的土地可免税三年至五年，国营和私营的试验农场和农产物歉收的农户，政府准予免纳税款。政府为照顾雇农和贫农，每村留有百分之十的免纳农业税的空额，以便农民申请。因为越南人民政府关怀农民的切身利益，所以这个征收农业税的法令得到了农民的热烈拥护。
    目前越南全国各地正展开缴纳农业税的爱国竞赛。村与村之间展开了竞赛，家庭与家庭之间也展开了竞赛。大家争着选择最好的、最干净的而又晒得最干的谷米缴纳给当地的各级税收机关。在缴纳农业税期间，青年们组织了服务队帮助缺乏劳动力的农户挑送纳税谷米。在通往政府仓库的路上，少年儿童们和当地文工团组织了“歇脚棚”，准备了茶水及各种各样的歌舞节目来接待纳税者。学校里的师生们都自愿地去到政府收税站服务，或帮忙管秤和司账。农民从四面八方地涌到收税站，使收税站变成了热闹的会场。这不仅在解放区是如此，而在敌占区的爱国人民，也往往在深夜里冒险挑着米，越过敌人的监视哨，到达解放区去缴纳农业税。
    朝鲜烈士子女和孤儿受到热情照顾
    朝鲜某地郡人民委员会为了使保育院里的烈士子女和孤儿们在严冬中吃饱穿暖，特给他们送去了一百五十多斤棉花、五吨萝卜、四十多吨煤和牛车一辆、牛一头。当地人民也经常给他们援助，在去年年底，就送了三十多袋米和一百三十多丈布。保育院并领到了人民民主国家人民送来的棉布一百三十五丈、棉花一千多斤。因此，儿童们能够穿上暖和的衣服过冬了。
    新年到来时，各地妇女都赶做新衣、棉袜、花鞋、点心，送给烈士子女和孤儿们。咸镜南道北青郡北青面民主妇女同盟送给孤儿们的新年礼物中，新衣服就有二百七十多套。
