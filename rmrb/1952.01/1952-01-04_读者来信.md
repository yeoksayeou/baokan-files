    Taiyuan Second Flour Mill of Shanxi Province Flour Company
    Employees Strive to Improve Machine Efficiency, With an Annual Increase of Nearly 120,000 Bags of Flour
    Editor: When the Taiyuan Second Flour Mill of Shanxi Province Flour Company was determining the durable life of its machines, some workers said, "Our machines are too old to be used for many more years!" Some said that machines that could be used for fifteen years could only be used for five years at most. In order to break this conservative thinking, the factory leadership decided to mobilize the masses to improve the efficiency of the machines. Labor model Su Maodan and others put forward suggestions for improvement. For example, the conveying wheel of the bran mill was originally 4.2 inches; after being changed to 7 inches, the speed of the driving wheel was increased; the polishing roller was changed to a wire drawing roller, which increased the powder scraping rate by 30.5%. These rationalization proposals were opposed by some people at the time. The factory held four technical seminars and conducted serious discussions before everyone's opinions were unified. On December 23, 1951, the factory completed the entire machine improvement plan. Now, the factory's hourly flour production has increased from 84 bags to 100 bags, an increase of 19% in output. The annual increase for the state is more than 119,000 bags of flour and more than 9,900 bags of bran, creating more than 6.4 billion yuan worth of wealth. All the factory's employees unanimously proposed to use this achievement to wish Chairman Mao a Happy New Year.

    Increased Production and Thrift Propaganda Launched in the Eleventh District of Beijing
    Extravagance and Waste Gradually Reduced
    In the rural areas of the Eleventh District of Beijing, waste was once prevalent. It mainly manifested in two aspects: one was waste in marriages, funerals, and childbirth. This was very serious last year because of the good harvest. According to statistics, a total of 500 couples got married in the district in the first half of last year, and it generally cost several million yuan. Lu Lianjiang of Xihongmen spent 7 million yuan to bury his grandmother. Liu Junde of Dahongmen had a grandson, and 500 people gave gifts for the full moon celebration, consuming 50 jin of wine alone. The other aspect was extravagant eating and drinking. Fu Ruixiang of Ruguo Yuan Village, who cultivated five mu of paddy field and sold one season of cabbage for 5 million yuan, has now eaten and drunk it all away.
    Since the launch of the propaganda work on increasing production and thrift in this district last November, waste has gradually decreased. For example, when Xu Runming, a member of the Communist Youth League in Jiugong Village, got married, he repeatedly persuaded his father with the help of the village head to return the sedan chair that had been booked. Hiring a sedan chair costs 300,000 yuan, and saving this money to buy fertilizer and send it to the fields would be of great benefit to the crops. Everyone understood this principle and slowly implemented new-style marriages. Many people who smoked paper cigarettes have now switched to smoking dry tobacco, and many villages have organized large-scale transportation teams to engage in sideline production. Zhao Youfu
    The Tenth District of Beijing Discovers Many Extravagant and Wasteful Phenomena in Village Finances
    In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the Tenth District of Beijing recently conducted a preliminary inspection of the financial situation of various villages and has discovered that eleven villages have extravagant and wasteful phenomena. Some of the fruits of land reform and the funds that I-Kuan-Tao leaders and others returned after defrauding the masses in the past have not been properly handled. For example, the 28 million yuan returned by an I-Kuan-Tao leader in Dongba Town was divided and stored in the public security police station, cooperative, theater troupe, and town government for everyone to use. Some villages also have disguised forms of apportionment. For example, under the leadership of the police station, Pingfang Village mobilized 4.4 million yuan from Zhonghua and other three brick kilns and a large-scale transportation team to equip a 30-person waist drum team. In Nanhua Yuan Village, led by villager Zhang Hongxiang, the tiles and bricks of six dilapidated temples in the village were sold, netting more than 4 million yuan, which was used to buy a complete set of utensils used for celebrating weddings in feudal society. After the village cadres learned about this, they neither stopped it nor reported it to the district government. In order to overcome the above phenomena, the Tenth District Government convened a meeting of village chiefs and finance and grain committee members on the 15th of last month, decided to conduct a more widespread and in-depth inspection of village finances, and passed several resolutions: 1. Village cadres should conscientiously and deeply study the call to increase production and practice thrift and combat corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and conduct propaganda and education among the masses. 2. Villages must not arbitrarily apportion grain, money, and materials to the masses. For facts of apportionment that have already occurred, accounts should be quickly cleared, announced to the masses before the end of December, and the masses should be told that in the future, no one should give anything to anyone unless instructed by the village government. 3. Register the existing public grain and various funds and materials in each village and submit opinions on how to handle them to the district government. 4. The village government should set an example, first formulate a thrift plan, ensure that stationery is not wasted, and save office expenses as much as possible.

    Health Authorities Should Use Medicines Rationally
    Editor: In the past, the liberated areas were blockaded by reactionary forces, and the supply of medicines was very difficult. Therefore, many health workers in the liberated areas, especially health administrative cadres, developed the idea of storing medicines. As long as it was a good medicine or a special medicine, the more the better, and they felt at ease only when they had enough medicines in their medicine depot for one or two years. But today's situation is very different from the past. Our country already has a pharmaceutical industry, and the difficulty of supplying medicines is basically gone. Therefore, today we should no longer have the idea of storing large quantities of medicines. The medicine depots of some health authorities in Shanxi Province have a lot of "Atebrin" and "Stibosan" in stock. The diseases treated by these medicines are rarely found in Shanxi, so they are not very useful. Some county-level health hospitals also have "Ethrogene chloroform" in stock for general anesthesia. In addition, many areas also have Japanese medicines from the past in stock. These medicines will deteriorate if stored for a long time, causing invisible losses to state property, which is very detrimental to the health cause.
    I believe that in areas where branches of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation have been established, local health authorities or public hospitals can appropriately reduce their medicine depots and can exchange slow-moving goods through pharmaceutical companies. When medicines are needed, they can be supplied directly by the pharmaceutical company. In this way, not only can medicines be used rationally, but it is also very necessary in the current situation where the funding for national health services is still insufficient.    Gao Quan
    The Publication Work of New Medical Books and Periodicals Should Be Adjusted
    Editor: Since liberation, new medical books and periodicals have been booming. As far as I know, there are about 50 kinds of newly compiled medical books of high and primary levels by public and private entities, and nearly 100 kinds of medical journals published in various places. This phenomenon is certainly gratifying, but it is not without its shortcomings.
    Too many publications not only waste manpower and material resources, but also inevitably lead to rough and shoddy work because manpower is not concentrated. Many journals, due to a lack of manuscripts, are written and pieced together by a small number of people, almost becoming "long-term serials." As a result, the content is poor and repetitive. There are also some medical journals that do not have a clear direction or mission. It's just that because there is such an organization, they have to publish a publication to embellish it, and the expenses are subsidized by the public, which is obviously a waste. I think that we should follow the example of the recent simplification of publications implemented in Hebei Province, cancel publications that do not need to be published separately, and merge publications with the same or similar nature.
    Secondly, there should also be a unified method for the compilation of teaching materials for medical universities. Until now, our medical colleges and universities do not have a textbook that can be uniformly selected for each subject. In the past, most medical colleges and universities selected British, American, German, and Japanese textbooks; the phenomenon of each doing its own thing was extremely serious. Self-compiled lecture notes in accordance with national conditions are still a matter after liberation. I suggest that our responsible authorities (Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, and General Administration of Publication) discuss as soon as possible, invite experts, compile textbooks for each subject that are suitable for national conditions, and use them as standard textbooks to correct these chaotic phenomena.

    Wasteful Phenomena in Business Publications Published by the East China Salt Affairs Bureau
    Editor: There is a great waste in the business publication "Salt Affairs Work" published by the East China Salt Affairs Bureau. This publication is a semi-monthly publication with seven staff members and requires more than 5 million yuan in expenses per issue. Twenty-four issues a year is more than 120 million. But as far as I know, this publication does not play a big role. Like the 20 or 30 copies of "Salt Affairs Work" stored in our own archives, most people never even look at them except for a very few responsible cadres who occasionally flip through them; some people even casually throw them away or tear them up and use them as waste paper. This situation is not only common in our own agency, but also very serious in other regions. Once, due to confidentiality reasons, the Salt Affairs Bureau had to recall more than 10,000 copies of "Salt Affairs Work," but only more than 3,000 copies were recovered, which shows that the vast majority of them were lost. Recently, more than 2,000 forms for soliciting opinions on "Salt Affairs Work" were issued (attached to the publication), but only five or six were returned (one of which had no opinion). A lot of manpower and material resources are spent, but in fact it does not play a big role in guiding the work, which cannot be regarded as a great waste! I think that if there are work problems, the local salt affairs leading organs can publish leaflets, or publish them through local newspapers. This will not only provide more timely guidance to the work, but also save the country a sum of money. For example, the two dispensable business publications published by the North China Changlu Salt Field have recently been discontinued in accordance with the spirit of simplification and thrift. I think this is completely correct. I hope the East China Salt Affairs Bureau will consider the above-mentioned opinions.

    Certain Administrative Cadres of Tongzhen Native Produce Company
    Act in Disregard of the Trade Union Law
    Editor: During our work in Tongzhen this time, we found that some administrative cadres of Tongzhen Native Produce Company do not comply with the Trade Union Law. The Tongzhen Native Produce Company originally had seven trade union committee members, three of whom were transferred away and were on sick leave. In mid-December of last year, the company transferred away Zhao Hengyuan, the cultural and educational committee member, resulting in no one responsible for the trade union's cultural and educational work. This transfer was decided by the company's two managers, without obtaining the consent of the company's trade union or the approval of the higher-level trade union in advance, which clearly violated the provisions of Article 11 of the Trade Union Law. After we learned about this situation, we raised our opinions to Xu Guangyuan, the company's deputy manager. Not only did he not admit his mistake, but he also said, "This is because our administrative side needs to transfer Zhao Hengyuan for work reasons." "It is a fact that the trade union was not informed, but we do not admit that this is a violation of the Trade Union Law." We believe that the actions of the administrative cadres of Tongzhen Native Produce Company in violating the Trade Union Law are inseparable from their bureaucratic work style. We suggest that these administrative cadres conduct a deep inspection of their mistakes and ensure that they will no longer violate the Trade Union Law.

    山西省面粉公司太原第二厂
    职工努力改进了机器的效能全年可增产面粉近十二万袋
    编辑同志：山西省面粉公司太原第二厂在测定机器耐用年限时，有些工人说：“咱们的机器太老，不能用多年啦！”有的把能用十五年的机器，说成顶多不过能用五年。为了打破这种保守思想，厂里领导方面决定发动群众进行改进机器效能的工作。劳动模范苏毛旦等提出了改进的办法。比如：麸皮磨的输送轮原来是四吋二分；经改为七吋后，增加了主动轮的速度；光磨滚改成为拉丝滚，提高刮粉率百分之三十点五。这些合理化建议，当时曾受到部分人的反对。厂里召开了四次技术研究会，认真地进行讨论后，才使大家的意见趋于一致。一九五一年十二月二十三日，这个厂完成了全部改进机器的计划。现在，厂里每小时生产的面粉从八十四袋增加到一百袋，产量提高百分之十九，全年可为国家增产面粉十一万九千多袋，增产麸皮九千九百多袋，创造价值六十四亿多元的财富。全厂职工一致提出，用这个成绩向毛主席拜年。

    北京十一区开展增产节约宣传
    铺张浪费现象已逐渐减少
    北京市十一区的农村中，曾经普遍地存在着浪费现象。主要表现在两个方面：一种是在婚、丧、生孩子上的浪费。因为去年丰收，这一点非常严重。据统计，这个区去年上半年共有五百对男女结婚，一般都要化数百万元。西红门卢连江埋葬他的祖母，化了七百万元。大红门刘俊德生了个孙子，办满月时，有五百人送礼，单酒一项就喝了五十斤。另一方面是大吃大喝。如果园村傅瑞祥，一个人种五亩水地，种一季白菜，卖了五百万元，现在就吃喝光了。
    去年十一月间，这个区展开关于增产节约的宣传工作后，浪费现象已日渐减少。如旧宫村青年团员徐润明结婚时，在村长帮助下，再三说服他父亲，把定下的花轿退了。雇一个花轿要三十万元，把这笔钱省下来，买肥料送到地里，对庄稼会有很大好处。大家明白了这个道理，慢慢都实行新式结婚了。很多吸纸烟的人现在改为吸旱烟了，很多村已组织起大车运输组搞副业生产。  赵有福
    北京市第十区检查村财政发现很多铺张浪费的现象
    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中，北京市第十区最近初步检查了各村的财政情况，已发现十一个村有铺张浪费的现象。有些村的一部分土地改革的胜利果实和一贯道点传师等退还的过去骗取群众的款项，还没有适当地处理。如东坝镇一贯道点传师退出的二千八百万元竟被分存公安派出所、合作社、剧团、镇政府，大家使用。有些村并有变相的摊派现象。如平房村在派出所领导下，向中华等三个砖窑和大车运输组动员了四百四十万元，装备了一个三十人的腰鼓队。南花园村，由村民张洪祥领头，把村中六间破庙的瓦砖卖掉，得款四百多万元，买了封建社会办理喜事应用的一套完整用具。村干部知道这件事后，既没有制止，也没有向区政府汇报。为了克服以上现象，第十区政府上月十五日召集各村村长、财粮委员举行会议，决定再普遍深入检查村财政，并通过了几项决议：一、各村干部要认真深入地学习增产节约及反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的号召，并向群众进行宣传教育。二、各村不得随便向群众摊派粮款和实物。已经发生的摊派事实，应迅速清理账目，在十二月底前向群众公布，并告诉群众，今后没有村政府布置，任何人要东西都不要给。三、登记各村现有公粮和各项款物，并提出处理意见报告区政府。四、村政府要以身作则，首先订出节约计划，保证不浪费文具，尽量节省办公费。

    卫生机关应当合理使用药品
    编辑同志：过去解放区受着反动势力的封锁，药品的供应有很多困难，因此有不少解放区卫生工作者，尤其是卫生行政干部，产生了储存药品的思想。只要是好药、特效药，越多越好，在自己的药库里存够一年或两年用的药品才放心。但是今天的情况和过去已经大不相同，我们国家已经有了制药工业，药品供应的困难基本上没有了。因此，今天就不应当再有大量储存药品的思想。山西省某些卫生机关的药库存有不少的“阿特伯灵”和“斯锑波霜”，这些药品所治的病在山西很少发现，用处不大；在某些县立卫生医院里也存着全身麻醉用的“依脱哥罗仿”；此外，不少地区还存着过去的日本药。这些药品放得久了就要变坏，无形中给国家财产造成损失，对卫生事业是很不利的。
    我认为现在在中国医药公司分支机构已经成立的地区，当地的卫生机关或公立医院就可以把药库适当缩小，并可通过医药公司交换冷背货。用药时，可直接由医药公司供应。这样，不只可以合理地使用药品，而且在目前全国卫生事业经费还不充足的情况下，也是十分必要的。    高权
    新医书刊出版工作应作调整
    编辑同志：解放以来，新医书刊正蓬勃发展。据我所知，公私新编高初级医学书籍，约有五十种左右；各地出版的医学杂志，则近一百种。这一现象固然可喜，但也不无缺点。
    刊物太多，不只是浪费人力物力，同时因为人力不集中，也难免粗制滥造。有许多杂志因稿件缺乏，只由少数人员自己写稿凑数，几乎成了“长期连载”。结果是内容贫乏，彼此重复。还有一些医学杂志，没有明确的方针和任务。只是因为有这么一个机关，不能不出一种刊物点缀点缀，经费则由公家贴补，这更显然是一种浪费。我觉得，应仿照河北省最近实行的刊物精简办法，把不必单独出版的刊物取消，把性质相同或相近的刊物合并。
    其次，关于医科大学的教材编撰，也需要有一个统一的办法。直到现在为止，我们医学院校各科，还没有一本可以一致选用的教科书。从前各医学院校，多选用英美德日教本；各自为政的现象，极为严重。按照国情自编讲义的，还是解放后的事。我建议我们的负责当局（教育部、卫生部及出版总署）从速商讨，延聘专家，编著适合国情的各科教科书，作为标准课本，以纠正这些混乱现象。

    华东盐务管理局
    出版的业务刊物有浪费现象
    编辑同志：华东区盐务管理局出版的业务刊物“盐务工作”有很大的浪费。这个刊物是半月刊，有七个工作人员，每期需经费五百多万元。一年二十四期就是一亿二千多万。但据我了解，这个刊物所起的作用并不大。像在我们自己资料室里存放的二、三十份“盐务工作”，除了极少数负责干部偶尔翻一翻外，绝大多数人是一看也不看的；甚至有的人随便把它乱丢或撕了当废纸用。这种情形不但在本机关很普遍，就是在其他地区也很严重。有一次因保密关系，盐务管理局须要收回“盐务工作”一万多份，但结果只收回三千多份，这可以说明其中绝大部分是被弄丢了。最近曾发了两千多份征求对“盐务工作”的意见的表格（是随刊物附送的），但只收回五、六张（其中还有一张没有意见）。化费了很多的人力、物力，实际上对工作指导作用不大，这不能不算是很大的浪费！我认为如有工作问题，可由当地盐务领导机关出版活页通报，或通过各地报纸发表。这样不只对工作的指导更能及时，并且还给国家节省一笔开支。如华北长芦盐场出版的两种可有可无的业务刊物，最近根据精简节约的精神已经停刊，我认为这是完全正确的。希望华东盐务管理局考虑上述我所提的意见。

    通镇土产公司某些行政干部
    有不遵守工会法的行为
    编辑同志：我们这次在通镇工作中，发现通镇土产公司有些行政干部不遵守工会法。通镇土产公司原有七个工会委员，被调走和因病休养的有三个。去年十二月中旬，公司又调走了文教委员赵恒元，致工会文教工作无人负责。这次调动是公司的两个经理决定的，事先既没有取得公司工会的同意，也没有取得上级工会的批准，显然违反了工会法第十一条的规定。我们知道这个情形后，就向公司副经理徐光远提意见。他不但不承认错误，还说：“这是我们行政方面因工作上需要而调动赵恒元的。”“没给工会知道是事实，但我们不承认这是违反了工会法。”我们认为通镇土产公司行政干部违反工会法的行动，是和他们的官僚主义作风分不开的。我们建议这些行政干部深刻检查错误，保证不再违反工会法。
