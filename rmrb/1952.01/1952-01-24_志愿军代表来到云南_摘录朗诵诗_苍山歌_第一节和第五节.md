    Volunteer Army Representatives Visit Yunnan
    --Excerpts from the Recitation Poem "Song of Cangshan" (First and Fifth Sections)
    Xu Jiarui, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea

    (I)
    Volunteer Army representatives arrive in Xiaguan
    The people of Xiaguan are ecstatically happy
    Before them lies the shimmering Erhai Lake
    Behind them stands the jade-like Cangshan Mountain
    When the representatives' floats arrive
    The singing beneath Cangshan is exceptionally magnificent
    "Heroically and valiantly, crossing the Yalu River"
    Twenty thousand hearts throb
    Twenty thousand mouths cheer and shout
    "Great Chairman Mao
    Great Communist Party"
    The workers of Xiaguan say
    "We have a great leader
    Who led the workers and peasants to rise up together
    You are warriors defending world peace
    You are Chairman Mao's most outstanding students
    You defeated American imperialism in Korea
    Creating countless glorious histories
    Today you come to Xiaguan
    Let us all raise you up high"
    Zhang Fu waves and laughs on the float
    Li Weiying is anxious in his heart on the float
    But the workers don't listen to reason
    And raise them both up high
    The workers cheer together
    "Glorious Volunteer Army
    Great Chairman Mao"

    (V)
    Volunteer Army representative Comrade Li Weiying
    Today arrives in Dali
    The welcoming line stretches from inside the city to outside
    Below are stacked flower mountains
    Above are canopies covering the sky (Note: Long sheds are built with colored cloth to cover the street)
    This flower mountain displays a giant statue of Stalin
    That one displays a giant statue of Chairman Mao
    These statues are all made of snow-white Dali marble
    The marble has finally fulfilled its wish today
    Waves of singing, lines of red flags
    Waves of waist drums, lines of yangko dancers
    Passing through the canopies, passing the flower mountains
    Reaching the foot of Wuhua Tower, the singing is even louder
    The red flags are even brighter
    The sound of firecrackers is crisper
    The sound of bugles is more majestic
    The sound of singing, the sound of cheering
    The sound of firecrackers, the sound of waist drums
    Mingling together
    Cangshan reveals a laughing color from the clouds
    People are dancing, laughing, cheering
    Taking pictures, offering flowers, offering red flags
    Pulling the representatives
    Wanting to pull him, wanting to hug him, wanting to lift him up
    Bouquets, flower petals, flower branches
    Scattering like rain on the floats
    The space between Cangshan and Erhai
    Has become a sea of various sounds and colors
    A sea of wild jubilation
    The representatives' floats pass through the crowd
    Pass through all kinds of lines
    Arriving in front of the Three Pagodas Temple
    A sheet of seawater, a mirror
    A row of Cangshan Mountains, a patch of white clouds
    Countless red flags beneath Cangshan
    Submerge all the crowds
    The masses have been waiting here for a long time
    Fifteen thousand people, fifteen thousand hearts
    Merged together, quietly, silently
    Not a single sound
    The wind blowing through the leaves can be heard
    As still as Erhai
    As quiet as Cangshan
    Sitting and listening
    Listening to this great report
    This heroic story

    志愿军代表来到云南
    ——摘录朗诵诗“苍山歌”第一节和第五节
    云南省抗美援朝分会主席　徐嘉瑞
    （一）
    志愿军的代表来到下关
    下关的人民快乐得发狂
    前面是一片莹晶的洱海
    后面是青玉似的苍山
    当代表的花车来到的时候
    苍山下的歌声非常雄壮
    “雄赳赳，气昂昂，跨过鸭绿江”
    两万颗心咚咚地跳动
    两万张嘴欢呼呐喊
    “伟大的毛主席
    伟大的共产党”
    下关的工人说
    “我们有了伟大的领袖
    领导了工农们一齐翻身
    你们是保卫世界和平的战士
    你们是毛主席最优秀的学生
    你们在朝鲜打垮了美帝国主义
    创造了无数的光辉的历史
    今天你们来到下关
    让我们大家来把你们高高抬起”
    张甫在花车上扬手大笑
    李维英在花车上心里着急
    工人们还是不由分说
    把他们两个高高地抬起
    工人们一齐欢呼
    “光荣的志愿军
    伟大的毛主席”
    （五）
    志愿军的代表李维英同志
    今天来到大理
    欢迎的行列从城中列到城外
    下面堆着花山
    上面扯着漫天过海（注：用彩布搭长棚遮住街）
    这座花山摆着斯大林的巨像
    那一座摆着毛主席的巨像
    这一些像都是雪白的大理石做成
    大理石到今天才达到了他的心愿
    一阵阵的歌声  一队队的红旗
    一阵阵的腰鼓  一队队的秧歌
    走过了彩棚  走过花山
    走到五华楼下  歌声更响亮
    红旗更鲜艳
    爆竹的声音更清脆
    军号的声音更雄壮
    歌唱的声音  欢呼的声音
    爆竹的声音  腰鼓的声音
    混在一起
    苍山从云雾中露出欢笑的颜色
    人们在跳  在笑  在欢呼
    在照像  在献花  在献红旗
    在拉着代表
    要拉他  要抱他  要抬起他
    花束　花片　花枝
    下雨一样地散在花车上面
    苍山和洱海的中间
    变成了各种的声音  各种的颜色
    一片狂欢的大海
    代表的花车  通过了人群
    通过了各种的行列
    到了三塔寺的面前
    一片海水  一面镜子
    一列苍山  一片白云
    苍山下面数不尽的红旗
    淹没了所有的人群
    群众早已在这里等候着
    一万五千个人  一万五千颗心
    融合在一起  静静地  悄悄地
    一点声音都没有
    风吹树叶都听得见
    像洱海一样地沉静
    像苍山一样地沉静
    坐着听着
    听这伟大的报告
    这英雄的故事
    （标题是编者加的）
