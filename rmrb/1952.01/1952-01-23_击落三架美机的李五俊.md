Li Wujun, deputy gunner of a heavy machine gun platoon of a certain unit of the People's Army, performed meritorious service in the defensive battles in the Jizhou, Fenggang, and Jidong areas from October to November 1950. When their unit was surrounded by the enemy in the Jidong area, he engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy using automatic machine guns and grenades, killing and wounding more than twenty enemy soldiers. Finally, their unit broke through the enemy's encirclement.

After the Chinese People's Volunteers entered Korea to fight, during the counterattack north of the Cheongcheon River, Li Wujun was assigned to the People's Army naval unit, where he was tasked with laying mines in the North Port of Wonsan. In April 1951, Li Wujun transferred to the "Aircraft Hunting Group" of a certain unit of the People's Army as a heavy machine gunner. On one occasion, the enemy attempted to destroy two bridges near Yongheung, a friendly forces' transportation line, with airplanes. At that time, they received the task of shooting down enemy planes. This was a very important task, and it was his first time shooting down airplanes. After arriving at the position, he immediately dug fortifications, made camouflage, and actively practiced anti-aircraft shooting. On May 1st, four enemy Mustang aircraft took turns bombing and strafing the bridges on the friendly forces' transportation line. The platoon leader gave the order to fire, and Li Wujun aimed at the enemy plane and began a fierce barrage. One of the enemy planes was hit. Soon, two enemy jet planes came and were shot down by him again. Then, eighteen enemy planes came and desperately bombed the People's Army positions, throwing gasoline bombs, and the entire mountain caught fire. Li Wujun's clothes were also burned. He quickly extinguished the fire on his body and continued shooting, and another enemy plane was shot down by him. In the course of a month and a half of anti-aircraft combat, Li Wujun shot down a total of three American planes.

On August 8, 1951, the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea awarded Li Wujun the highest honor of the Korean people—the title of "Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea," and awarded him the Order of the National Flag, First Class, and the Gold Star Medal of Hero.

    击落三架美机的李五俊
    一九五零年十月至十一月间，人民军某部重机枪排副射手李五俊，在吉州、凤岗和极洞等地区的防御战中，以他的机智和勇敢立了功。当他们的部队在极洞地区被敌人包围时，他用自动机枪和手榴弹与敌人展开了白刃战，杀伤敌人二十余名，最后他们的部队终于突出了敌人的包围。
    中国人民志愿军入朝作战后，在清川江以北进行反击时，李五俊被编到人民军海军部队，担任元山北港埋设水雷的任务。一九五一年四月，李五俊转到人民军某部“飞机打猎组”担任重机枪射手。有一次，敌人企图用飞机破坏友军的运输线——永兴附近的两座桥梁。当时他们接到了射击敌机的任务。这个任务是很重的，他还是第一次打飞机呢。他到了阵地以后，马上就挖工事，做伪装，积极练习对空射击。五月一日，敌人的四架野马式飞机，对友军运输线上的桥梁进行了轮番的轰炸和扫射。排长的射击命令下来了，李五俊瞄准敌机开始了猛烈的射击。其中一架敌机被打中了。不久，敌人的两架喷气式飞机又来了，又被他打落了一架。接着，又来了十八架敌机，对人民军阵地拚命地轰炸，扔汽油弹，满山都起了火，李五俊的衣服也被烧着了，他连忙扑灭身上的火，继续射击，又有一架敌机被他击落了。在一个半月的对空射击的战斗里，李五俊一共击落了三架美国飞机。
    一九五一年八月八日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会授予李五俊朝鲜人民的最高荣誉——“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄”的称号，并授予他一级国旗勋章和英雄金星章。（附图片）
