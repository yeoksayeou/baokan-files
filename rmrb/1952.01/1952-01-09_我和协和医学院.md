My background and past education have undeniably had a significant impact on my thinking. My family was a typical "scholar-official" family of old China. The so-called scholar-official was one and the same with the bureaucratic landlord class. Although I was the eldest son and grandson in this large family, before I went abroad, the influence of my family on me was far less than the influence of my education abroad. At the age of eighteen, I went abroad by chance. At that time, I didn't think about why I was going abroad. When I arrived in England, because the government funding was designated for those studying medicine, I studied medicine. Having studied medicine, I settled down to study and work. By the time I thought about going home, I was almost thirty years old. During these twelve years, especially in England, my thinking was deeply dominated by individualism and reformism, so I was most deeply touched after reading Comrade Stalin's "Conversation with the British writer H.G. Wells".

After returning to China, I went to Shanghai. I was unwilling to rely on my family and hoped to break away from it and become independent. Peking Union Medical College was the best-equipped medical school in the country at the time. I thought it suited my personal aspirations and interests, so I spent more than ten years in this small world. Here, I carried out teaching and research tasks, enjoyed the reputation of being a "scholar," and the generous treatment and comfortable life fully satisfied my personal needs.

After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, my beautiful dream was disturbed. At that time, the Japanese's ferocity and unreasonableness struck at my self-esteem. Thinking that my "career" would be impossible to develop after the Japanese came, I became concerned about my personal future and sought another way out, going to Guiyang to run a school.

The reason I did this was entirely out of personal interest. At that time, I styled myself as a medical education expert, and during the Anti-Japanese War, I only cared about running my medical school, regardless of for whom I was running the school or where the funding for the school came from. In addition to obtaining the support of the reactionary Kuomintang government, I wanted surplus American military supplies, and I did not refuse the money of the American oil tycoon. As a result, the school was established, and Kuomintang secret agents followed, becoming directors of student affairs. I adopted a compromising attitude of not competing with others and got along with him. I knew very well that many things he did were wrong, but I didn't object early on, because doing so would affect my so-called "career". It was not until he disrupted my entire teaching plan that I dismissed him, but this also brought me a lot of trouble. Even so, I did not recognize the essence of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. I did not refuse the Kuomintang party card that was sent to me, and even when I was kept in the Kuomintang Central Training Corps in Chongqing along with other university presidents for training, I participated in a muddle-headed way.

Later, the American Rockefeller Foundation hired me as the president of Peking Union Medical College, and I agreed. This fully demonstrated that I had not considered the question of who I was serving. I thought this would further develop my "career".

Because I studied in England for a long time, the education of the European and American bourgeoisie had a great influence on my thinking. My view of social development was the same as that of H.G. Wells. I believed that the social system could be changed through gradual changes; the old order itself was disintegrating, so there was no need to overthrow it by revolutionary methods, nor was it necessary to use violent revolution to establish a new society. This reformist view led me into the wrong path of "saving the country through education". I thought that the education I was running had a certain effect on the change of social order; I thought that improving the quality of my school could affect the development of new medicine in China. After studying Stalin's "Conversation with the British writer H.G. Wells," I recognized the reactionary essence of reformism, which is impossible to realize.

I studied medicine, and narrow-minded objectivism made me think that treating diseases was the doctor's primary task, while ignoring the social causes of diseases. When teaching students, I only knew how to impart some medical theories and technical knowledge, and as for who the students would serve in the future, I didn't care. At most, I only talked abstractly about the doctor's task of relieving human suffering. My "supra-class" and "supra-political" attitude also influenced some of the people I interacted with.

I stood in a third-party position to handle affairs, always maintaining a so-called "objective" attitude towards everything. Therefore, I only saw the superficial phenomena of things, but failed to understand their essence. I adopted this attitude towards the revolutionary situation, and also towards the patriotic movements of the students. The same was true when dealing with school administrative work. This method of handling problems was wrong, and many mistakes occurred in my past so-called "career". For example, I rigidly applied a set of medical education systems from capitalist countries as the standard for medical education in our country.

Because I often looked at problems in isolation, the habit of splitting hairs was inevitable. My view of medical education was like this, full of purely technical viewpoints, while neglecting the people's demands for medical education. Long after liberation, I still raised the issue of the international level of medical education, continuing to maintain the purely technical viewpoint of Peking Union Medical College. It was not until I clearly realized that the purely technical viewpoint had become the biggest obstacle to the ideological transformation of myself and the teachers of Peking Union Medical College that I realized the correct principle that technology must be combined with politics.

I thought that I was a mechanical materialist in the field of natural science, but in reality, I had not escaped the shackles of idealism. Although I was not a religious believer, I often used "universal love" to exhort people, and I nodded in agreement with the saying "repay evil with virtue". I believed that struggle and revolution were not the most ideal way to solve problems. I also looked at problems from the premise that everyone is a good person. I often said that a person always has his merits, and we should conceal his faults and praise his virtues. This way of understanding problems is idealistic, because I did not investigate a person's class essence.

In this ideological remolding study for teachers in Beijing and Tianjin universities, after listening to reports, reading documents, and through group study and personal experience, I have a preliminary understanding of my past stale, wrong, and even reactionary thoughts. But this can only be regarded as the beginning of recognizing mistakes and correcting mistakes. As for how to establish correct positions, viewpoints, and methods in practice, and to serve the people wholeheartedly, it still requires my subjective efforts. I am willing to thoroughly transform my thinking under the supervision and help of my comrades.

During the period when I left school to devote myself to the so-called "personal career", most of the time was spent at Peking Union Medical College. When Peking Union Medical College reopened in 1947, I was responsible for the administrative work of Peking Union Medical College again, so Peking Union Medical College had a great influence on me, and I personally had a considerable influence on Peking Union Medical College. In retrospect, I should be largely responsible for the slow progress of Peking Union Medical College after liberation.

Peking Union Medical College was founded in 1906 by several British and American church groups. In 1915, it was taken over by the American Rockefeller Foundation. Except for the six years after the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Rockefeller Foundation ruled this school for thirty years. The Rockefeller Foundation is a worldwide cultural aggression organization. Except for the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, there is almost no corner of the world that does not have its base of aggression. From a personal point of view, Rockefeller had at least two obvious motives for establishing this fund: one was to gain both fame and fortune, both to obtain the title of "great philanthropist" and to expand his dumping market; the other was to evade a large amount of income tax in the name of running "educational undertakings" and "charitable undertakings". But to export this considerable amount of tax-free and non-directly profitable US dollars (estimated at 250 million US dollars) abroad, it must be approved by the State Council and be considered in line with the entire aggression plan of the State Council. This fully shows that Peking Union Medical College is an important link in the American aggression plan in the Far East. Another important fact can further prove that the cultural aggression policy of the US State Department and the Rockefeller Foundation are closely combined. In the past, the Rockefeller Foundation had set up many "scholarship" quotas to lure some students from certain countries. In 1949, the US State Department absorbed this experience and established a large number of such "scholarships," with quotas 32 times larger than those of the Rockefeller Foundation. In this way, the Rockefeller Foundation created a method of cultural aggression for the US State Department. As Dr. Deng Jiadong said, everything in Peking Union Medical College in the past was special, that is to say, all the systems, teaching methods, work styles, and lifestyles of Peking Union Medical College were moved from the United States without modification. As Dr. Zhou Jinhuang said, all the teaching, research, and medical styles of Peking Union Medical College were based on the standards of the bourgeoisie. In this way, a group of highly individualistic and pro-American medical personnel were trained. They emphasized personal interests, blind research, and free business. They were not only indifferent to the laws of social development and the progress of the revolution, but also considered it a disturbance to social peace. In short, in just 30 years, American imperialism achieved its goal of cultural aggression with 23 million US dollars, creating a group of so-called "democratic and free" elements among medical and health workers, making them serve it obediently. If it were not for the correct leadership and education of the People's Government and the Communist Party, we would probably have fallen into the abyss forever without knowing how to extricate ourselves.

In the past, I was a thorough reformist, so I handled all the administrative affairs of Peking Union Medical College from this point of view. After liberation, I also realized that some systems of Peking Union Medical College should be changed, but I did not dare or was unwilling to let go and change them. For those systems that should be changed, I at most thought that they were out of touch with the times, but I did not stand on the people's position (at that time, I was still standing on the anti-people's position) to criticize and negate everything in Peking Union Medical College in the past. I only affirmed one major premise, that is, Peking Union Medical College certainly has shortcomings, but it also has advantages. This just exposed my conservative and fearful-of-change thinking, fundamentally negating that ideological remolding is a revolution. Therefore, Peking Union Medical College still retains many old systems and old work styles, such as the one-year rotation system for the dean of academic affairs, the free work style of each department acting on its own, and the failure to give due attention to Soviet scientific theories.

In the past, I also implemented the "supra-political" and "supra-class" views into administrative work, hoping that everyone in Peking Union Medical College would also be supra-political and supra-class. I thought that professors should be able to work peacefully in the laboratory, and students should study behind closed doors, without being "disturbed" by politics. I believed that the opinions of the technical expert department heads should be respected, and all department affairs and the arrangements for advanced students should be carried out based on their opinions, but I also regarded imperialist elements such as William Douw as "scholars" and "professors," treating them all equally regardless of whether they were enemies or friends. This purely technical viewpoint is also a major factor hindering the progress of Peking Union Medical College.

In this ideological remolding study movement, it is undeniable that Peking Union Medical College has already moved, and everyone has a preliminary understanding of their own thoughts and the past of Peking Union Medical College. However, further clarification of past wrong thoughts still requires greater efforts.

    我和协和医学院
    中国协和医学院院长  李宗恩
    不可否认的，我的出身和过去所受的教育对于我的思想有着极大的影响。我的家庭是旧中国典型的“士大夫”家庭。所谓士大夫，它是和官僚地主一而二，二而一的。虽然我是这大家庭中的长子长孙，但在我出国之前，家庭对我所产生的影响远不及我在国外所受的教育的影响之大。十八岁时，我偶然地出了国。当时我并未想到我为何出洋。到了英国，因为官费是指定给学医的人，我就学了医。及至学了医也就安心读书，安心做事；等到后来想到该回家的时候已经近三十岁了。在这十二年中，尤其是在英国，我的思想就深深地被个人主义、改良主义所支配，所以我读了斯大林同志“与英国作家威尔斯的谈话”后所得的感触也最深。
    回国后到了上海，我不愿依附家庭，希望脱离家庭而独立。北京的协和是当时全国设备最充实的一个医学校，我认为它适合我个人的志愿和兴趣，就在这个小天地内一过又是十几年。我在这里执行着教学和研究任务，享受着“学者”的美名，而优厚的待遇、舒适的生活又充分满足了我个人的要求。
    一九三七年抗日战争爆发以后，我的美梦被扰乱了。那时日本人的凶残无理，打击了我的自尊心。又想到日本人来了以后，我的“事业”将无从开展，于是对个人的前途有了顾虑，遂另找出路，远走贵阳办学。
    我所以这样做，完全是从个人利益出发的。当时我俨然以医学教育专家自居，在抗日战争时期只管办我的医学院，却不问为谁办学，也不问办学的经费是从那里来的。除了取得国民党反动政府的支持以外，美军剩余物资我要，美国煤油大王的钱我也不拒绝。于是学是办起来了，学校里也就跟着来了国民党的特务分子训导主任。我就抱着不与人争的妥协态度和他相处。自己明明知道他很多事做得不对，但也没有及早反对。因为这样做会影响我的所谓“事业”。到后来他扰乱了我的整个教学计划的时候，我才把他解聘了。但也因此替我找来了许多麻烦。虽然如此，我并未认识到国民党反动统治的本质，国民党送来了党证我并未拒绝，甚至把我留在重庆国民党中央训练团随同其他大学校长一同受训时，我也就糊里糊涂地参加了。
    后来美国洛氏基金委员会聘我做协和医学校校长，我答应下来了。这更充分表现出我对于为谁服务的问题是没有考虑过的。我认为这样可以更进
    一步地发展我的“事业”。
    由于我长期在英国学习，欧美资产阶级教育对我的思想有很大的影响。我对于社会发展的看法同威尔斯一样，认为社会制度是可以由渐变的方式变更的；旧秩序本身在瓦解着，可不用革命的方法来把它推翻，也不必用暴力的革命来建立新的社会。这种改良主义的看法使我走入“教育救国”的歧途，我自以为我所办的教育对社会秩序的变革产生着一定的作用；我认为提高了自己学校的质量就可以影响中国新医学的发展。及至学习了斯大林“与英国作家威尔斯的谈话”后，我认清了改良主义的反动的实质，它是不可能实现的。
    我是学医的，褊狭的客观主义使我认为治病是医生的首要任务，而忽略了产生疾病的社会原因。教学生的时候，只知道传授一些医学学理和技术知识，至于学生将来为谁服务那就不管了，至多只是抽象地谈到医生的任务是为人类解除痛苦。我的这种“超阶级”、“超政治”的态度也就影响了部分和我相处的人们。
    我是站在第三者的地位来处理事务的，对一切总是保持着所谓“客观”的态度。因此，我只看到事物的表面的现象，而未能领会其本质。对革命形势我采取这种态度，对同学们的爱国运动也是这样。就像处理学校行政工作时也不例外，这种处理问题的方法是不对的，在我过去所办的所谓“事业”中曾发生了不少错误。例如，我硬搬了资本主义国家的一套医学教育制度来做为我国的医学教育制度的准绳。
    由于我常常孤立地看问题，钻牛角尖的习惯也就难免了。我对医学教育的看法就是如此，充满了单纯技术观点，而把人民对医学教育的要求忽略了。解放后很久我还提出过医学教育的国际水平问题，继续维持着协和的纯技术观点，一直到我清楚地认识到纯技术观点对我个人对协和教师的思想改造成了最大的阻力的时候，我才体会到技术必需和政治结合的正确原则。
    我以为我在自然科学的范畴内是一个机械唯物论者，实际上并未摆脱唯心主义的羁绊。我虽非宗教徒，但常常以“博爱”去劝勉人们，对“以德报怨”的说法我是点头赞许的。我认为斗争和革命不是解决问题的最理想的办法。我也是从一切人都是好人这个前提来看问题的。我常常谈到一个人多多少少总还有他的好处，我们应该隐恶扬善。这种认识问题的方法是唯心的，因为我没有追究一个人的阶级本质。
    在这次京津高等学校教师的思想改造学习中，听了报告，读了文件，通过小组学习及个人体验，我对我过去那些陈腐的、错误的、甚至反动的思想有了初步的认识。但这只能算是认识错误和改正错误的开始，至于如何在实践中去建立正确的立场观点和方法，做到全心全意为人民服务，还有待于我的主观努力。我愿意在同志们的督促和帮助下彻底改造我的思想。
    在我离开学校致力于所谓“个人事业”的时期，多半的时间是在协和。及至一九四七年协和复校，我又负责协和的行政工作，这样协和对我的影响是很大的，而我个人对协和的影响也不小。检讨起来，解放以后协和所以进步慢，我是应该负相当的责任的。
    协和是在一九○六年由几个英美教会团体创办的，一九一五年由美国洛氏基金委员会接办，其中除在太平洋战争爆发后停办了六年，洛氏基金委员会统治了这个学校整整三十年。洛氏基金委员会是一个世界性的文化侵略机构，除了苏联及新民主主义国家以外，世界上几乎没有一个角落没有它的侵略基地，洛克菲勒建立这笔基金的动机从他个人方面说至少有两个很明显的目的，一是名利兼收，既可得到“大慈善家”的名义，又可扩大他的倾销市场。一是可以用办“教育事业”“慈善事业”为名而逃避一笔很大的所得税。但是要输出这一笔相当大的免税而无直接利润的美金（估计两亿五千万美元）到国外去必须通过国务院，而被认为是符合于国务院的整个侵略计划的。这充分说明了协和是美国的侵略计划在远东的一个重要环节。还有一个重要的事实更可证明美国国务院的文化侵略政策和洛氏基金是密切结合着的。在过去洛氏基金曾设立了很多“奖学金”的名额，来诱骗某些国家的部分学生。一九四九年美国国务院就吸收了这个经验，大量地设立这种“奖学金”，其名额较洛氏基金多达三十二倍，洛氏基金就这样为美国国务院创设了一种文化侵略的办法。协和的过去正如邓家栋大夫所谈，一切是特殊化，也就是说协和的一切制度、教学方法、工作作风和生活方式都是从美国原封不动地搬来的。也正如周金黄大夫说的，协和的一切教学、研究、医疗作风无不以资产阶级的水平为准绳。这样就训练出来一批高度个人自由主义和亲美、崇美的医护人员。他们强调个人兴趣、盲目研究和自由营业。他们对于社会发展的规律，革命的进展不但无动于衷，反而认为是扰乱了社会的安宁。总而言之，美帝国主义在短短的三十年中，以二千三百万元的美金达到了它的文化侵略的目标，在医药卫生工作者中造成了一批所谓“民主自由”分子，让他们服服贴贴地为它服务，要不是在人民政府和共产党的正确领导和教育下，我们恐怕要永远跌在深渊里而不知自拔。
    过去我是一个彻头彻尾的改良主义者，因此处理协和的一切行政事务也是从这一个观点出发的。解放以后我也察觉到协和有些制度是应当改变的，可是不敢也不肯放手去改。对于那些应该改变的制度，我顶多认为不合潮流，而未站在人民的立场（那时我根本还是站在反人民的立场）去批判和否定协和过去的一切。我只肯定了一个大前提，就是协和固然有缺点，但是也有优点。这正好暴露了我的保守的惧怕变革的思想，根本否定了思想改造是一种革命。因此至今协和仍保留着很多的旧制度和旧作风，例如一年一轮的教务长制度、各系各自为政的自由作风、对苏联的科学理论未予以应有的重视。
    我过去把“超政治”、“超阶级”的看法也贯彻到行政工作中，希望协和的一切人也超政治超阶级。我以为应该竭力使教授们可以安心地在实验室中工作，学生们闭门读书，而不被政治所“扰乱”。我认为对于技术专家的科主任的意见是应该尊重的，一切科内事务以及进修生的安排都本着他们的意见进行，但是我把窦威廉之流的帝国主义分子也认为是“学者”“教授”，竟不分敌我地一律看待。这种单纯技术观点也是阻碍协和进步的主要因素。
    在这次思想改造学习运动中，协和不可否认地是已经动起来了，每一个人对自己的思想和协和的过去已经有了初步的认识。但是对过去错误思想的进一步澄清，还有待于更大的努力。
