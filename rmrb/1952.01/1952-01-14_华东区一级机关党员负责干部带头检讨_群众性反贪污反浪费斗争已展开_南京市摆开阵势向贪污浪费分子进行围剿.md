Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 13th: First-level organs of the East China Administrative Region have systematically launched a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. In most organs, Communist Party leading cadres have taken the lead by setting an example, first making self-criticism reports, thereby initiating democratic inspections. The Communist Party members and non-Party activists in these organs have basically been mobilized. The self-criticism reports of some leading cadres have already been shared with the masses, starting the mobilization of all staff from the inside out. Following this step, a mass confession and denunciation movement, including all organ staff and people from all walks of life, will be rapidly launched.

Prior to launching the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, first-level organs of the East China Administrative Region made preparations in two aspects. On the one hand, they organized all organ staff to study and incubate ideas; on the other hand, they spent more than ten days investigating the corruption, waste, and bureaucracy situation in various organs. The focus of the investigation was on financial and economic organs, as well as the general affairs and procurement departments and organ production undertakings of various organs. The method of investigation was for leaders to personally take action and convene various meetings. The Chinese Communist Party Group of the East China Military and Administrative Committee's Production Increase and Thrift Committee convened a meeting at the end of last year for Party members working as administrative section chiefs or in finance and auditing in various organs, collecting materials they provided and mobilizing them to bravely make self-criticism and denunciation. Responsible cadres and production increase and thrift sub-committees of various major organs also convened meetings of personnel managing funds, warehouses, materials, and organ production to investigate the situation. Rao Shushi, Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman of the East China Military and Administrative Committee, convened meetings of Party member responsible cadres of various organs many times to strictly supervise and inspect. In addition, the East China Military and Administrative Committee's Production Increase and Thrift Committee organized three inspection brigades to delve into organs with more problems to conduct inspections.

This preliminary investigation and research was a shocking undertaking. It powerfully shattered the then-prevalent paralyzing complacency and stimulated the masses' struggle emotions against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. For the first time since taking office, the responsible cadres of many organs personally investigated the expenditure accounts of their organs. They were shocked to discover the seriousness of corruption and waste in their organs and the adverse consequences of their bureaucratic style and extravagant waste. Many organs discovered clues and evidence of major corruption cases, as well as the serious situation of responsible cadres' inability to distinguish between public and private interests and extravagant waste, which aroused public indignation.

After the leading authorities grasped the general situation through more than ten days of preliminary investigation and research, they decided that starting from the New Year, all organs would launch a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the manner of rectification. At the New Year's Eve celebration held by the East China Military and Administrative Committee on December 28th of last year, Chairman Rao Shushi pointed out to the cadres above the rank of section chief in the first-level organs of the East China Administrative Region: "Starting from New Year's Day, all organs must immediately, without exception, and thoroughly mobilize the masses to launch this movement. Whoever adopts a bureaucratic attitude towards this movement demonstrates that he is bureaucratic towards all problems, he will become an obstacle to the movement, and he will be unceremoniously swept away." Rao Shushi then further announced at the meeting of Party member responsible cadres: a deadline was set for launching the movement, and those who failed to launch it by the deadline would be removed from their positions and investigated. Thus, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement conducted in the manner of rectification in various organs quickly unfolded. Party member responsible cadres in various organs first set an example by conducting self-criticism in Party group meetings and branch meetings, and launching democratic inspections. These meetings invited youth leagues, trade unions, and non-Party activists to participate. In some organs, because the responsible cadres made thorough self-criticisms, the masses were quickly mobilized, and a mass confession and denunciation upsurge was quickly formed.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the movement, the Party Committee of the directly subordinate organs of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Party Committee of the directly subordinate organs of the East China Military and Administrative Committee convened Party member representative meetings of their respective subordinate organs in early January, and invited non-Party activists to participate. Both meetings were mobilized by Rao Shushi himself, which powerfully encouraged the determination and courage of Party members and the masses to fight against bourgeois ideology, corruption, waste, and bureaucratic styles that divorced themselves from the masses. The Party member representative meetings selected people who had made profound and thorough self-criticisms to make demonstration reports; they also ordered those who were unwilling to humbly self-criticize or even suppressed criticism in their organs to make self-criticisms to the congress. Party member representatives and non-Party activists became the backbone of the movement. During the meeting, they attended meetings during the day and returned to their organs at night to convey the spirit of the congress, effectively promoting the movement in their organs.

Now, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in first-level organs of East China is about to enter a large-scale confession and denunciation stage, because most organs have already had Party member responsible cadres make thorough self-criticisms from top to bottom, and Party members and non-Party activists have basically been mobilized. In order to further investigate, various organs will separately convene symposiums with merchants who have direct purchasing and sales relationships with their organs, mobilizing them to confess and denounce the facts of bribery and corruption. At the same time, they will vigorously promote the anti-bribery, anti-fraud, anti-profiteering, and anti-tax evasion movement in the business community, so that they can cooperate internally and externally, concentrating their fire on a fierce encirclement and suppression of corruption, waste, and bureaucratic elements.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 13th: The struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in Nanjing has entered the stage of comprehensively launching a confession and denunciation movement. The characteristic of this stage is to concentrate the firepower of all parties to encircle and suppress serious acts of corruption and waste.

Since the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the Nanjing Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee has always implemented the policy of leaders personally taking action and boldly mobilizing the masses. It has gradually taken measures to promote this movement into the confession and denunciation stage. These measures are: first, organizing forces to help key departments with serious problems. Second, setting deadlines and ordering units that have not yet mobilized the masses to quickly mobilize the masses. Third, ordering units where the movement is still stuck in inspecting general daily trivial matters to quickly guide the masses' struggle to inspecting serious incidents of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Fourth, ordering the responsible persons of each unit to set an example and conduct ideological inspections. Through these measures, the comprehensive confession and denunciation movement in various organs of the city has basically been launched.

In order to ensure that the confession and denunciation movement is carried out correctly, the Nanjing Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee and thrift inspection organizations at all levels have adopted the following main methods: The first is to combine mobilizing corrupt elements to confess automatically with mobilizing the masses to denounce. In many departments, corrupt elements have confessed automatically because they have been educated in the movement. The Nanjing Branch of the People's Bank of China has already had 645 people confess automatically. However, there are still some corrupt elements who are unwilling to confess, which requires mobilizing the masses to denounce them. The second is to treat corrupt elements who confess automatically and those who refuse to confess differently. Those who confess automatically are treated leniently, and some are exempted from punishment. Those who refuse to confess are severely punished. Sixteen people in the Nanjing Branch of the China Grain Company who had committed corruption errors confessed automatically and expressed their willingness to repent and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. The leadership treated them leniently and gave them criticism or demerit punishments according to the severity of their circumstances and the degree of their confession. Yang Xuelei, a corrupt element in the Nanjing Branch of the China People's Relief Administration, not only refused to confess, but also colluded with other corrupt elements to sabotage the movement. The leadership immediately dismissed him from his post and investigated him. The third is to mobilize confession and denunciation from all sides, and implement a four-pronged attack on corrupt elements. After the launch of the anti-bribery, anti-fraud, anti-profiteering, and anti-tax evasion movement in the Nanjing business community, as of the 10th, they had confessed and denounced more than 500 bribery and acceptance of bribery incidents. Shop assistants throughout the city have also been mobilized, setting up a powerful battle array to encircle and suppress corruption and bribery elements. Fourth, all departments universally convene mass confession and denunciation meetings, and systematically organize corrupt elements who have confessed to speak out and make public confessions and reflections at the meetings. This will be a great inspiration to those who have not confessed or have not confessed thoroughly, and at the same time, it is an effective way to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses and launch the denunciation movement.

    华东区一级机关党员负责干部带头检讨
    群众性反贪污反浪费斗争已展开
    南京市摆开阵势向贪污浪费分子进行围剿
    【新华社上海十三日电】华东大行政区一级机关有步骤地展开了反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动。多数机关的共产党员负责干部都以身作则，首先作了检讨报告，由此展开了民主检查。这些机关的共产党员和党外积极分子基本上都已发动起来。一部分机关负责干部的检讨报告已经和群众见面，开始从内到外地发动全体工作人员。紧接着这个步骤之后，包括全体机关工作人员和社会各界的群众性的坦白、检举运动，即将迅速展开。
    华东大行政区一级机关在开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动之前，曾经做了两方面的准备工作。一方面组织全体机关工作人员进行学习和思想酝酿；另一方面曾以十多天的时间调查了各机关的贪污、浪费和官僚主义情况。调查的重点是财政经济机关以及各机关的总务采购部门和机关生产事业。调查的方法是首长亲自动手，召开各种会议。华东军政委员会增产节约委员会的中共党组曾在去年年底召集在各机关中担任行政处长或财务审计等工作的党员开会，收集他们提供的材料，动员他们勇敢地作自我检讨和检举。各主要机关的负责干部和增产节约分会也分别召集管理经费、仓库、物资和机关生产的人员开会，调查情况。中共中央华东局书记、华东军政委员会主席饶漱石曾多次召集各机关的党员负责干部开会，严格地督促检查。此外，华东军政委员会增产节约委员会并组织了三个检查大队，有重点地深入到问题较多的机关中去进行检查。
    这次初步的调查研究是一件震动人心的工作，它有力地打破了当时普遍存在的麻痹自满思想，激发了群众反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争情绪。许多机关的负责干部自从任职以来，第一次亲自调查本机关的经费开支账目。他们发现了本机关贪污、浪费情况的严重性，发现了自己的官僚主义作风和铺张浪费行为所造成的恶果，大吃一惊。不少机关从调查中发现了重大贪污案的线索和证据，发现了负责干部公私不分、铺张浪费的严重情况，因而引起了群众的义愤。
    经过十多天的初步调查研究，领导方面掌握了大致的情况以后，决定从新年开始，各机关都以整风方式开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动。饶漱石主席在去年十二月二十八日华东军政委员会召开的庆祝元旦晚会上，向到会的华东大行政区一级机关处长以上的干部指出：“从元旦开始，各机关必须立刻毫无例外地、贯彻到底地发动群众，展开这个运动。谁对待这个运动采取官僚主义的态度，就说明他对所有的问题是官僚主义的，他将要成为运动的障碍，将要被毫不容情地扫除。”饶漱石接着又在党员负责干部会议上进一步宣布：限期展开运动，过期不展开的即予撤职查办。于是，各机关以整风方式进行的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动就迅速展开了。各机关党员负责干部首先以身作则，在党组会议、支部大会上进行自我检讨，发动民主检查。这些会议都邀请青年团、工会和党外群众中的积极分子参加。一部分机关由于负责干部做了彻底的检讨，群众很快地发动起来，群众性的坦白、检举热潮也很快地形成了。
    为了加强对运动的领导，中共中央华东局直属机关党委会和华东军政委员会直属机关的中共党委会分别在一月上旬召开了所属机关的党员代表会议，并邀请党外积极分子参加，这两次会议都由饶漱石亲自作动员报告，有力地鼓舞了党员群众与资产阶级思想、贪污、浪费行为以及脱离群众的官僚主义作风作斗争的决心和勇气。党员代表会议选择了检讨深刻、坦白彻底的人做示范报告；同时也责成在本机关不肯虚心检讨甚至压制批评的人向大会做检讨。党员代表和党外积极分子都成为了运动中的骨干。他们在会议期间，白天开会，晚上回到本机关去传达大会的精神，有效地推动了本机关的运动。
    现在，华东一级机关的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动，由于已有多数机关的党员负责干部自上而下地做了彻底的检讨，党员和党外积极分子基本上已经发动起来，因此运动即将进入大规模的坦白、检举阶段。为了进一步进行调查，各机关将分别召集与本机关直接有采购买卖关系的商人开座谈会，动员他们坦白和检举行贿、贪污的事实。同时将大力推动工商业界的反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏运动，使内外配合起来，集中火力向贪污、浪费和官僚主义分子进行猛烈的围剿。
    【新华社南京十三日电】南京市反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，已进入全面开展坦白、检举运动的阶段。这个阶段的特点是集中各方面的火力，向严重的贪污、浪费行为进行围剿。
    自反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开以来，南京市节约检查委员会始终贯彻首长亲自动手、放手发动群众的方针。并逐步采取了推动这一运动进入坦白、检举阶段的措施。这些措施是：第一、组织力量，帮助问题严重的重点部门。第二、规定期限，责成那些群众尚未发动起来的单位迅速发动群众。第三、责成运动仍停滞在检查一般生活琐事的单位，迅速将群众的斗争锋芒引导到检查严重的贪污、浪费和官僚主义的事件上去。第四、责成各单位负责人以身作则，从思想上进行检查。经过这些措施，全市各机关全面的坦白、检举运动基本上已经开展起来。
    为了保证坦白、检举运动正确地进行，南京市节约检查委员会和各级节约检查组织采取了以下几种主要办法：第一是动员贪污分子自动坦白和发动群众检举相结合。在许多部门里，贪污腐化分子因为在运动中受到教育，纷纷自动坦白。中国人民银行南京分行自动坦白的已有六百四十五人。但是还有一部分贪污分子不肯坦白，这就需要发动群众来检举他们。第二是对自动坦白和拒不坦白的贪污分子分别对待。对自动坦白的从轻处理，有的免予处分。对拒不坦白的则从严惩办。中国粮食公司南京分公司十六名犯有贪污错误的人都自动坦白，并都表示愿意痛改前非，立功赎罪，领导方面就对他们从轻处分，按照他们的情节轻重和坦白程度分别给以批评或记过的处分。中国人民救济总会南京市分会贪污分子杨学礼不但拒不坦白，而且串通其他贪污分子破坏运动，领导方面立即予以撤职查办。第三是从各方面发动坦白和检举，对贪污腐化分子实行四面夹攻。南京市工商界反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏运动展开以后，到十日为止，他们坦白和检举出来的行贿、受贿事件已有五百多件。全市店员也已经动员起来，摆开了围剿贪污和行贿分子的有力阵势。第四、各部门普遍召开群众性的坦白检举大会，有计划地组织已经坦白的贪污分子在大会上现身说法，当众进行坦白反省，这对于尚未坦白或坦白不彻底的人会有很大启发，同时，这也是鼓动群众热情，展开检举运动的有效办法。
