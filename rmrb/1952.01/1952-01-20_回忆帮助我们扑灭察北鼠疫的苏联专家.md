    Remembering the Soviet Experts Who Helped Us Eradicate the Plague in Chabei
    Technician, Bureau of Maternal and Child Health, Ministry of Health, Wang Shijin
    I remember it was in late October 1949 when I was ordered to go to Chabei to investigate and diagnose virulent infectious diseases. After arriving at Longwangmiao and Chahanbengbeng in Chabei, I found that pneumonic plague was prevalent there. The work of eradicating the plague had just begun when news came that "More than a dozen Soviet experts have arrived in Longwangmiao to help prevent and control the plague." Soviet experts came from distant Moscow to Chabei, China, and, regardless of the danger, came to Longwangmiao to assist in the prevention and control of the virulent infectious plague. This spirit of internationalism moved me greatly. I immediately rushed to Longwangmiao. At this time, some of the Soviet experts were in a meeting, and some had already gone to Chahanbengbeng to understand the situation. At 7:00 p.m., I met Soviet experts Comrades Rogozhin and Maisky, etc. They had just arrived and had not yet had a rest, but they instructed us to start the meeting immediately. The local comrades in charge of the reception suggested starting after dinner, but the expert insisted on starting first. He said:
    "Don't worry about us eating or not. The main thing is to know what the current epidemic situation is." We began to give them an investigative report on the plague epidemic. They concentrated on listening. The room was so quiet that, apart from the sound of the report and the translation, almost no breathing could be heard. When they heard something suspicious, they immediately asked questions until they understood it clearly. When it came to the route of transmission, although the place names and personal names in Chabei were difficult to remember, they were so serious in listening and writing. The meeting lasted from 7:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. The Soviet experts forgot about eating and resting. Their concern for the suffering of the Chinese people and their serious and responsible attitude towards work are something I will never forget.
    In the past, the Japanese method of disinfecting the furniture in the houses of plague patients was by burning. When we arrived at Longwangmiao, Beishacheng Village and other places had already adopted this method. Although we considered that Chabei was short of wood and it was not easy to rebuild, we thought this method was a "thorough method" to eliminate the source of infection, so we did not correct it and allowed the masses to burn more than 20 houses. After the Soviet experts learned about this situation, they clearly pointed out that this method was incorrect. The Soviet experts said: "If we use burning for disinfection like this, the masses will avoid us. The methods we promote must take care of the long-term interests of the masses. Methods such as plastering houses and using fire to scorch fleas are more easily accepted by the masses." These short sentences gave me great education and inspiration. I examined my own views on the burning disinfection method. Although I had temporarily thought about the difficulty of the local masses building houses, I had not considered the interests of the people more. Every time "the masses" were mentioned in the experts' talks, it stimulated my thinking and made me realize the weakness of my mass perspective. From the bottom of my heart, I felt that the Soviet experts were lovely and respectable.
    In the freezing cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius, the Soviet experts took care of the patients meticulously. Their spirit of internationalism, their serious and responsible work style, and their sincere love for the Chinese people greatly encouraged the working enthusiasm of every Chinese comrade. With the help of Soviet experts, the plague in Chabei was eradicated in just over a month. Every time I think of this experience of working with Soviet experts in Chabei to eradicate the plague, I deeply feel how seriously our medical workers should learn from the Soviet experts' spirit of serving the people so that we can become better medical workers for the people.

### 回忆帮助我们扑灭察北鼠疫的苏联专家

    回忆帮助我们扑灭察北鼠疫的苏联专家
    中央卫生部妇幼卫生局技正　王诗锦
    记得是在一九四九年十月底，我奉命去察北调查及诊断烈性传染病。到察北龙王庙和察汉崩崩后，当地正流行着肺鼠疫。扑灭鼠疫的工作开始不久，忽有消息说：“苏联专家十多人，已到龙王庙来帮助防治鼠疫了。”苏联专家从遥远的莫斯科来到我国察北，并不顾危险地到龙王庙来协助防治烈性传染的鼠疫，这种国际主义精神使我很感动。我立刻赶赴龙王庙，这时，苏联专家们一部分在开会；一部分已去察汉崩崩了解情况。下午七时会见了苏联专家罗果金和马意斯基等同志，他们刚到此地，还没有得到休息，便嘱咐即刻开会，当地负责招待的同志建议晚饭后开始，专家坚持先开会，他说：
    “先不用管我们吃饭不吃饭，主要是要知道现在的疫情如何。”我们开始向他们作了鼠疫流行的调查报告，他们集中精神在听，房里是那样静，除了报告和翻译的声音外，连呼吸声几乎都可听到。当他们听到有怀疑时，便马上追问，一直到弄清楚。当谈到传染路径时，虽然察北的地名和人名很不好记，但他们是那样认真地一边听，一边写。会议从下午七时一直开到午夜二时，苏联专家忘记了吃饭和休息，他们这种关心中国人民的疾苦，和对工作的严肃负责的态度，使我永远不能忘记。
    过去日本人对鼠疫患者所住房屋家具的消毒方法，是用焚烧法。当我们到龙王庙时，北沙城村等地都早已采用了这个办法。我们当时虽然考虑到察北木料缺乏，修建不易，但又想这个办法是消灭病源的“彻底方法”，便未加纠正，听任群众烧了二十多间房屋。苏联专家知道这一情况后，便明确提出这一方法是不正确的。苏联专家说：“这样用焚烧消毒的办法，群众会躲避我们。我们推广的方法，一定要照顾群众的长远利益，如抹房子、用火燎跳蚤等方法，便易为群众所接受。”这短短的几句话，对我的教育和启发很大。我检查自己对于焚烧消毒方法的看法，虽然曾一时想到当地群众盖房子困难，但没有更多地考虑人民的利益。在专家谈话中每提到“群众”，都刺激了我的思想，发觉自己群众观点的薄弱。从内心里感到苏联专家的可爱和可敬。
    苏联专家在零下二十度的冰天雪地，对待病人照顾得无微不至，他们那种国际主义精神，认真负责的工作作风，对中国人民的挚诚热爱，大大地鼓舞了每个中国同志的工作情绪。察北的鼠疫，在苏联专家的帮助之下，仅一个多月的时间便扑灭了。我每次想起在察北和苏联专家在一起扑灭鼠疫的这段经历，便深深感到我们医务工作者应该如何认真学习苏联专家为人民服务的精神，使自己成为一个更好的人民医务工作者。
