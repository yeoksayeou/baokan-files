Fu Guanjun managed the warehouse in the Fourth Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau. He used his work privileges to steal more than ten items such as radio headphones, raincoats, cotton quilts, and undershirts. He also exchanged damaged goods for good ones from the warehouse, such as tweed pants and green uniforms. In 1950, he went to work at the Eleventh Police Station of the Fourth Branch of Beijing, where he conspired with police officer Pang Kuitai to embezzle 32,000 yuan from the cooks' wages. Fu Guanjun's father, Fu Zhibao, served as a purchasing officer in the Fourth Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau. He used his power to embezzle and accept bribes totaling more than one million yuan, and misappropriated public funds, borrowing money from merchants, which he has not yet repaid, amounting to more than one million yuan.

After the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was launched in the Fourth Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, Fu Guanjun pondered, "Should I confess?" He thought, "My father's problem is very serious. The lightest punishment for confessing would be expulsion, and he might even be prosecuted." He also thought, "The things I stole are all packed in boxes. The accounts only record 'one box,' and the contents of the box are not on the books. If I don't confess, no one will know." So, he decided not to confess. On December 24th of last year, when Fu Guanjun returned home, he asked his father, "What should we do?" His father said, "I've already reminded all the buyers." Fu Guanjun repeatedly asked, "Is it going to work? Is it stable?" After a while, he said again, "The shopkeeper of Yichangtai (district representative) is relatively progressive. Will he report your material?" His father did not respond. In the end, he decided not to speak.

The next day, after Fu Guanjun returned to the police station, he pretended to be calm on the surface. However, he always felt that everyone was watching him, so he was uneasy. On December 30th of last year, the first stage of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement of the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau passed, and Fu Guanjun was secretly pleased: "I passed one hurdle."

On January 4, 1952, the Fourth Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau held its second mobilization meeting. When Fu Guanjun heard the director of the branch say that "this movement must be carried out thoroughly," he began to struggle again. He considered, "I have to confess, but should I confess only a part? Or should I confess everything? Should I confess only myself? Or should I confess my father as well?" He had many ideological concerns. He remembered that last December, his younger brother returned from the Northeast and said how powerful the motherland's air force was and how rapidly the construction and development in the Northeast was progressing. His younger brother's full of love for the motherland deeply moved him. The next day, the staff of the Eleventh Police Station of the Fourth District studied the self-confession of Xu Huiliang, a staff member of the Eleventh Branch of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, which was published in the People's Daily on January 4th. Fu Guanjun found his own path, boldly and thoroughly confessed his mistakes, and also reported his father and Pang Kuitai and six others. On January 8th, the Fourth Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau held a general meeting of all cadres and police officers. At the meeting, the director of the Public Security Branch announced that Fu Guanjun would be exempted from punishment. He also praised his confession and reporting actions. At that time, Fu Guanjun was very moved, and his confidence in seeking progress was further strengthened. After the meeting, he immediately went to mobilize his father to confess thoroughly. He also mobilized other comrades in the general affairs section to correct their attitudes. Under his inspiration, Shen Shaoting confessed his problems and boldly reported their head of the general affairs section.

    傅冠军找到了正确的道路
    坦白贪污行为并动员别人坦白
    傅冠军在北京市公安局内四分局管理仓库。他利用工作上的便利条件，曾经偷盗无线电耳机、雨衣、棉被、汗衫等物十余件，又曾拿坏东西换仓库里的好东西，如人字呢裤子、绿制服等。一九五○年，他到北京市内四分局第十一派出所工作，又和民警庞魁泰合谋克扣炊事员工资三万二千元。傅冠军的父亲傅治保担任北京市公安内四分局采买干事，他曾经利用职权，贪污受贿百多万元，并挪用公款，向商户借钱，到现在没有还的，还有百余万元。
    北京市内四分局展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动以后，傅冠军心里就盘算：“谈不谈？”他想：“父亲的问题很严重，谈出来最轻是开除，甚至要法办。”他又想：“我偷的东西都是在箱子里装着的，账上只记着‘箱子一口’，箱子里面的东西并未上账，不谈别人也不知道。”所以，他决定不谈。去年十二月二十四日，傅冠军回家时，问他父亲：“怎么办？”他父亲说：“我已经到各买卖家叮嘱了一下。”傅冠军一再追问：“是不是行？稳不稳呢？”待一会，他又说：“义昌泰掌柜（区代表）比较进步。会不会把你的材料反映上去？”他父亲没有应声。他最后还是决定不讲。
    第二天，傅冠军回到派出所后，表面还故作镇定。可是，他总觉得大家在注意他，因此心绪不宁。去年十二月三十日，公安四分局反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的第一个阶段过去了，傅冠军心里窃喜：“过了一关”。
    一九五二年元月四日，北京市公安四分局又召开了第二次动员大会。傅冠军听到分局长说“这个运动一定要搞彻底”，思想又斗争起来。他考虑：“谈是要谈，是谈一部分呢？还是全部谈呢？是光谈自己呢？还是连父亲一起谈出来？”他有许多思想顾虑。他想起去年十二月间，他弟弟从东北回来说，祖国的空军是如何强大，东北的建设发展是如何迅速，等等。他弟弟对祖国满腔热爱，使他深深地感动了。第二天，内四区十一派出所的工作人员学习了一月四日人民日报刊登的天津公安局十一分局科员徐惠梁的自白书，傅冠军找到了自己的道路，大胆地、彻底地坦白了自己的错误，并且检举了他的父亲和庞魁泰等六人。一月八日，北京市公安四分局召开全体干部警士大会，公安分局局长在会上宣布对傅冠军免予处分。并且还表扬了他的坦白和检举行动。当时，傅冠军很受感动，要求进步的信心更巩固了。会后，他马上去动员他父亲彻底坦白，他并且动员总务股其他同志端正态度，在他的启发下，沈绍庭交代了自己的问题，并大胆地检举了他们的总务股长。
