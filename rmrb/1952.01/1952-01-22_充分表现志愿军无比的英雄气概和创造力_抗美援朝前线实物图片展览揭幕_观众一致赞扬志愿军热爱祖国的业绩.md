Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: An exhibition of frontline material objects and photographs from the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea opened on January 21st at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. The exhibits are part of the items brought back from the Korean front by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation.

Among the material objects and photographs on display, there are twenty-eight various silk banners presented to the Volunteer Army by the heroic Korean People's Army and the Korean people; sixty-eight photographs reflecting the Volunteer Army's fighting, life, and the friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples; there is also the bayonet captured from the U.S. military by the famous combat hero Cui Jianguo, who used this bayonet to stab six American devils to death in the Battle of Galisan; and there is also a large iron shovel that a soldier named Wei Ming from a unit of the Volunteer Army used to kill two American soldiers. The exhibits also include frontline soldiers' combat tools, bedding, food, and various daily necessities and cultural entertainment tools created using enemy shrapnel, steel, and other waste materials. These exhibits fully demonstrate the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's unsurpassed heroic spirit and boundless creativity.

The exhibits are divided into six major sections. In the section of daily necessities, various daily necessities of the Volunteer Army soldiers are displayed, ranging from rice pots, steamers, and buckets to chopsticks, spoons, knives, and soap boxes. All of these were made by the soldiers using the enemy's scrap metal. They shortened gasoline barrels to make marching pots and hammered barrel lids into cooking pots. Cook Luo Peirong hammered a kitchen knife from the scrap iron of a downed enemy plane and named it "Victory Knife." The soldiers collected enemy aircraft bullet casings of different calibers to make oil lamps. They also made paper candles from used waxed paper from artillery shells and pine oil candles from boiled pine oil. The soldiers made spoons from copper pieces after artillery shell explosions and hammered soap boxes and lunch boxes from aluminum blocks from destroyed enemy aircraft, and also made buckets. The soldiers also used the tail of an American 500-pound bomb to make a brazier and large cans to boil water to drink.

The soldiers cherish every item brought from the motherland. A cook's carrying pole was broken, so he made it into many bamboo brushes for scrubbing pots. A soldier's canteen was half-damaged by a shell, so he attached a wooden handle to the other half and converted it into a rice spoon; when the rice spoon leaked, he nailed many holes in it to make a colander. When the shovels and picks were shortened by rocks while digging fortifications, the soldiers heated them red in the fire and hammered them longer with stones. A soldier named Li Fengxiang from a certain unit captured an eight-inch-long pure steel shovel from the enemy, which had been worn down to only three inches in more than a year.

With a high degree of revolutionary optimism and cultural and artistic accomplishment, the Volunteer Army soldiers created many cultural and entertainment devices to enrich their battlefield cultural life. They used the motherland's horsetail, Korean branches and thin bark (as snakeskin), American artillery shell casings, and copper wire from electric wires to make huqins (Chinese fiddles), which they proudly called "Two Continents and Three Countries" huqins. They used captured American gasoline barrels and artillery shell casings to make gongs, cymbals, and other percussion instruments. They called these instruments "Western musical instruments." They also made wooden castanets from the motherland's fried flour boxes and wooden xylophones from wooden boards with copper wires from electric wires attached. They also made drums by stretching cowhide over hollowed-out tree stumps, scraped pine oil to make rosin, and made sanxians (three-stringed plucked instruments) from cans. They also made suonas (Chinese shawms) by burning holes in thick branches with red-hot iron rods, attaching reeds to the top to make whistles, and attaching aluminum skins to the bottom. During breaks in the fighting, they would happily sing.

The exhibits also reflect the Volunteer Army soldiers' tireless spirit of learning. When the soldiers lacked paper on the front lines, they used bark, leaves, and corn husks to write wall newspapers. The soldiers also cut many paper-cut window decorations. These paper-cuts were used by the soldiers to decorate their fortifications. They cut many heroic postures of killing the enemy and shooting; they also cut many humiliating scenes of the enemy kneeling down and surrendering.

These exhibits moved and educated every visitor. Many visitors talked as they walked, saying that the Volunteer Army's hard life and brilliant creations on the front lines provided everyone with an example of hard work and love for the motherland. (Attached pictures)

    充分表现志愿军无比的英雄气概和创造力
    抗美援朝前线实物图片展览揭幕
    观众一致赞扬志愿军热爱祖国的业绩
    【新华社二十一日讯】抗美援朝前线实物及图片展览会，二十一日在北京市劳动人民文化宫揭幕。这次展览的实物和图片是中国人民志愿军归国代表团从朝鲜前线带回来的展览品中的一部分。
    在这次展览的实物和图片中，有英雄的朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民献给志愿军的各色锦旗二十八面，反映志愿军战斗、生活和中朝人民战斗友谊的照片六十八幅；有著名的战斗英雄崔建国缴获的美军的刺刀，崔建国曾用这把刺刀在加里山战斗中刺死六个美国鬼子；还有一把大铁锹，志愿军某部战士魏明曾用它砍死了两个美国兵。展览品中还有前线战士们在战地的作战工具、被服、食物和利用敌人的弹片、钢铁和其他废物所创造的各种生活用具和文化娱乐器具等。这些展览品充分表现了中国人民志愿军无比的英雄气概和无限的创造力。
    展览品分为六大部。在生活日用品部里，陈列着从饭锅、蒸笼、水桶到筷子、勺子、小刀、肥皂盒等志愿军战士们的各种日常生活用品。这一切都是战士们利用敌人的破铜烂铁所做成的。他们用汽油桶截短做行军锅，把桶盖锤成菜锅。炊事员罗培荣用被击落的敌机上的废铁锤了一把菜刀，并给它起个名字叫“胜利刀”。战士们搜集敌机的不同口径的子弹壳，做成油灯。他们还把用过的包炮弹的蜡纸，做成纸蜡烛；把松油熬成松油蜡烛。战士们把炮弹爆炸后的铜片做成勺子，用被击毁的敌机上的铝块锤成肥皂盒、饭盒和做成水桶。战士们并用美国五百磅大炸弹弹尾做火盆，用大罐头煮水喝。
    战士们对祖国带去的每一件东西，都十分喜爱。一个炊事员的扁担已经用断了，他就把它做成许多把刷锅的竹刷。一个战士带去的水壶被炮弹打坏了一半，他把另一半装上木柄改做饭勺；饭勺漏了，他又把它钉许多洞改成漏勺。在挖工事时，铁锹和铁镐被岩石磨短了，战士们就把它放在火上烧红了用石头把它锤长了再用。某部战士李凤翔缴自敌人的一把八寸长的纯钢的铁锹，一年多来磨得只剩三分长。
    有着高度的革命乐观主义精神和文化艺术素养的志愿军战士们，创造了许多文化娱乐的器具来丰富自己的战地文娱生活。他们利用祖国的马尾，朝鲜的树枝和软薄的树皮（当蛇皮），美国的炮弹壳和电线里的铜丝，制成胡琴，他们骄傲地把这叫做“两洲三国”胡琴。他们用缴获的美国汽油桶、炮弹壳制成锣、钹等打击乐器。他们把这些乐器叫做“西洋乐器”。他们也用祖国的炒面箱做成木椰子，用木板按上电线里面的铜丝做成木琴。他们还用牛皮蒙在掏空的树桩上做成鼓，刮松油制松香，用罐头制成三弦等。他们还把粗树枝用烧红的铁条烫通，上面用芦苇做哨，下面按上铝皮做成唢呐。在战斗空隙中，他们就愉快地演唱起来。
    在展览品中，还反映了志愿军战士们不倦的学习精神。当战士们在火线上缺乏纸张时，他们就用树皮、树叶、玉米外衣写墙报。战士们还剪了许多窗花。这些窗花是战士们贴在工事里当装饰用的。他们剪了很多杀敌、射击的英姿；也剪了许多敌人跪下缴枪的狼狈相。
    这些展览品感动和教育了每一个观众。许多观众边走边谈，他们表示：志愿军在前线艰苦的生活和光辉的创造，给了大家艰苦奋斗，热爱祖国的榜样。（附图片）
