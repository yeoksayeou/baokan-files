    The relevant departments should promptly handle the wage arrears of the Six River Gully Coal Mine capitalists
    Editor: We are workers at the private Six River Gully Coal Mine in Anyang County, Pingyuan Province. The coal mine capitalists were in arrears with our wages for March, April and May of the year before last. Because we could not maintain our lives, we went to the Anyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office Labor Section to request arbitration. The capitalists guaranteed to the Labor Section that they would pay the wages. However, under the pretext of paying wages, the capitalists wantonly destroyed and sold the mine's original machinery, rails, iron materials, etc., and felled more than 600 trees. The capitalists also planned to demolish our dormitories and then sell the building materials. Fortunately, this matter was discovered early and stopped by the local government. Since October of last year, the capitalists have again been in arrears with our wages for three consecutive months. We are producing on empty stomachs, which is extremely distressing. Many workers cannot send money home, and their families have to suffer from hunger and cold. Our lives have reached the point of being precarious and unable to borrow money. On December 21st last year, we again sent representatives to the Prefectural Commissioner's Office Labor Section, requesting them to solve this problem. The Labor Section summoned the capitalists' representative, Li Guanjun, and pointed out that arrears in wages were illegal. Li Guanjun signed an agreement guaranteeing that all outstanding wages would be paid in full before December 31st last year. But Li Guanjun went to Hankou and never returned, and we still have not received our wages. We request the Anyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office to handle this matter promptly.
    The entire staff of the Six River Gully Coal Mine

    六河沟煤矿资方拖欠工资有关部门应迅速处理
    编辑同志：我们是平原省安阳县私营六河沟煤矿的工人。煤矿资方在前年拖欠了我们三、四、五月份的工资。我们因为没法维持生活，就到安阳专署劳动科要求仲裁。资方向劳动科保证支付工资。但是，资方借支付工资为名，大肆破坏和出卖矿里原存的机器、道轨、铁料等，并砍伐树木六百多棵。资方还计划把我们的宿舍拆除，然后出卖屋料。幸亏这件事被发觉得早，由当地政府制止了。自去年十月份开始，资方又一连拖欠了我们三个月的工资。我们饿着肚子生产，真是苦恼异常。很多工人因为没有钱寄回家去，一家老小只好挨饿受冻。我们的生活已到朝不保夕、借贷无门的地步。去年十二月二十一日，我们又派代表到专署劳动科，要求他们解决这个问题。劳动科把资方代表李冠军传来，指出拖欠工资是违法行为。李冠军签订了协议书，保证在去年十二月三十一日前把所欠工资全部发清。但李冠军去汉口后，再不回来，我们的工资到现在仍没拿到。我们要求安阳专署迅速处理这件事。　　六河沟煤矿全体职工
