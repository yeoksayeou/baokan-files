    To the Tongxian Special District Office of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions:

    Unemployment Relief Funds Should Not Be Withheld and Used

    Comrade Editor: In the spring of 1950, workers in the Tongxian Special District donated over 10 million yuan to provide relief to unemployed worker brothers in Shanghai. However, Liu Dexiang, the director of the Tongxian Special District Office of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, used the excuse of providing relief to unemployed workers in the district to withhold more than 3.5 million yuan, which was deposited in a bank to generate interest. The whereabouts of over 1 million yuan of these funds are now unknown due to unclear accounting. During the Three-Anti Campaign (anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy), the person in charge of the office has not yet made a thorough self-criticism regarding this matter. I suggest that relevant departments pay attention to this matter.

    河北省总工会通县专区办事处
    不应扣留和动用失业工人救济金
    编辑同志：通县专区职工在一九五○年春天，捐款一千多万元，救济上海失业工人兄弟。但是，河北省总工会通县专区办事处主任刘德香竟以救济本区失业工人为藉口，扣留了三百五十多万元，存在银行里生息。这些款子中有一百多万元因账目不清，已不知下落了。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，办事处的负责人对这件事还没有作深刻检查。我建议有关部门重视这件事。    彦能
