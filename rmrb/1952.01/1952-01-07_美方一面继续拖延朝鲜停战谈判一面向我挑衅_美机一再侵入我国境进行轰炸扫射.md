Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 6th: While the US side continues to delay the Korean armistice negotiations, US aircraft repeatedly intruded into our Northeast border in the latter half of December 1951 and carried out bombing and strafing.

At 18:18 on December 26, an enemy plane intruded into the airspace over Dadonggou, southwest of Andong, for low-altitude reconnaissance, and dropped one illumination flare. Afterwards, the plane flew to the airspace over Beijingzi and dropped four bombs on both sides of the Beijingzi highway. One of the bombs landed in Guojiatun, three kilometers east of Beijingzi, injuring eight residents (three women and five men), destroying five houses, and killing two mules.

At 18:00 on December 31, an enemy bomber dropped a bomb two kilometers east of Dadonggou and carried out strafing. At 18:38, after being fired upon by our anti-aircraft artillery over Dagushan, the plane dropped another bomb in Wenjialou (about fifteen kilometers northwest of Dagushan), injuring five residents and destroying fourteen houses. The plane fled at 18:45.
