Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 8th. Czechoslovak Socialist Republic President Antonín Novotný delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly plenary session on the 3rd regarding the issue of China's representation in the United Nations.

	Novotný said: The Czechoslovak delegation fully supports the Soviet Union's proposal to have the 15th UN General Assembly discuss the issue of China's seat in the United Nations. We believe that the draft resolution proposed by the United States and passed in the General Committee is a disgraceful manifestation of continuing a hostile policy towards China. We believe that the General Assembly should reject this proposal. On the contrary, the amendment proposed by the Nepalese and Guinean delegations, expressing the wishes of all those who have a sincere attitude towards peace and the United Nations organization, must be accepted.

	Novotný said: Restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is urgent, because the pressing issues of the current international situation, first and foremost the solution of the issue of comprehensive and complete disarmament, are urgent, and these issues cannot in fact be successfully resolved without the participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China.

	Next, Novotný refuted the slanders and insults made by the US representative against the great Chinese people and their government.

	Novotný pointed out: The People's Republic of China is a strong socialist power whose essence of existence dictates that it is a peace-loving country. In terms of foreign policy, it advocates the principle of peaceful coexistence, and it is fully entitled to participate in all activities of the United Nations.

	The US representative here talked about the so-called aggressive acts of the People's Republic of China. It is truly surprising how shamelessly he distorts the facts. The People's Republic of China uncompromisingly defends the rights of freedom and independence of the people of colonial dependencies. It condemns the shameful attacks of the colonialists on the Republic of Congo and the disgraceful role played by the United Nations agencies there. This attitude is by no means aggression, but serves the cause of peace.

	The Chinese people helped the fraternal Korean people resist the brutal military action launched by the United States and its allies under the stolen flag of the United Nations. The government of the People's Republic of China actively promoted the signing of the Korean armistice agreement and withdrew its People's Volunteers, while the US military remained in South Korea, continuing to maintain tension in the region and hindering the peaceful reunification of Korea. Therefore, it is not the People's Republic of China but the United States that has an aggressive attitude on the Korean issue.

	The US military has occupied the Chinese island of Taiwan for ten years, and the US military has turned Taiwan into an atomic and missile base against the Chinese mainland, thereby threatening not only the security of the Chinese people but also the peace of the entire Asia. The People's Republic of China demands that the American occupiers withdraw from Taiwan and other Chinese islands - to which the Chinese people have a sacred right - who wants to say that this is aggression?

	It is entirely justified for the People's Republic of China to protest the occupation of Taiwan; it is entirely justified for it to oppose the US military provocations in the Taiwan Strait and the constant violation of Chinese airspace by US military aircraft; it is entirely justified for it to sternly warn the US government that if it does not end these provocative acts, they will bring disastrous consequences. Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev correctly praised the patience of the Chinese people here, who have been trying to liberate Taiwan by peaceful means for ten years.

	Novotný said that the facts prove that the root cause of tension in the Far East and the Pacific region is by no means the People's Republic of China, but the US government and its aggressive policy. On the contrary, we believe that the firm position of the government and people of the People's Republic of China is a major contribution to the efforts of peace-loving people of all countries to prevent a new war. For example, this year, the government of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly proposed the conclusion of a collective security treaty between the countries in the Asian and Pacific region to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone; this year, the government of the People's Republic of China concluded treaties of peace, friendship, and mutual non-aggression with the governments of Nepal, Burma, and Afghanistan. It is well known that the government of the People's Republic of China has also established and deepened good relations with many other countries, and strives to resolve disputes through talks and consultations.

	Novotný also refuted the US representative's slander that the People's Republic of China has launched a "hate-filled propaganda campaign against foreign governments and peoples." According to the US representative, "the viciousness of this propaganda campaign is unprecedented" and its "main target is the United States." Novotný said that this is indeed strange. If the People's Republic of China answers the constant provocations of the US government and tells the truth, this is said to be "hate-filled propaganda." And the delegations of various countries read American newspapers, hear American radio, and watch American television every day, and they see nothing else, only contempt, slander, and insults against the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries.

	Novotný reminded the US representative that we know of some other propaganda weeks, which are propaganda weeks held by the United States against socialist countries, and their viciousness is truly unprecedented. I would also like to remind you that there is a so-called "Radio Free Europe" about forty kilometers from our border, which does not spread hate-filled propaganda for weeks, but for years, and shouts unscrupulously. This radio station is maintained with American money and supported by the US government.

	Novotný again refuted the US speaker's slander that the Chinese people live in a "spiritual hell" and are "whipped to produce more wealth." Novotný pointed out: The people of the People's Republic of China are continuing to advance along the path of their thousands of years of culture, and are developing the great Chinese culture unprecedentedly today. This is an extremely beautiful country with wise, hardworking, humble, and peace-loving people. The Chinese people have created miracles in the eleven years of their free life. It is using tireless labor to eliminate the heavy legacy of colonialism. It is building the foundations of modern industry and agriculture. It has overcome hunger and infectious diseases, and overcome illiteracy. Its life is getting better, richer, and more civilized year by year. Is it possible that such a magnificent undertaking could be done by a "powerless, enslaved people" as the US representative said? Who does he want to lecture on freedom?

	Novotný pointed out that as long as we go a few dozen or hundreds of kilometers south of New York, we can see "Whites Only," "Coloreds Forbidden," and other reactionary racism, the greatest insult to human dignity, and the suppression of individual freedom.

	Even in New York, representatives of certain African and other countries have personally experienced what equality and freedom are all about here. You will not see any of these phenomena in the People's Republic of China or in any other socialist country. There, true freedom exists regardless of skin color or nationality. The government of the People's Republic of China has rescued so many small non-Han ethnic groups in its own territory, given these ethnic groups rights, and enabled them to achieve comprehensive development. This is the truth about the People's Republic of China, which cannot be concealed by any slander.

	Next, Novotný condemned the Western countries, led by the US government, for opposing the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China coming to the United Nations. He said that the United States is afraid that the representatives of the People's Republic of China will promote the United Nations to become a truly all-encompassing global organization, so that the voices and views of each country or each type of country will be fully respected here, insulting discrimination and voting machines cannot exist here, and behind-the-scenes conspiracies that attempt to eliminate the proposals that the entire human race is calling for cannot exist here. The United States' actions to undermine the progressive work of the United Nations in this way must be stopped.

	It is by no means the Chinese people who are suffering because the Chinese people do not have a seat here. The Chinese people will continue to firmly follow their own path towards the prosperity of their country, and no insult can stop it from advancing. The current situation is harming the United Nations, which cannot successfully solve many urgent tasks without the participation of the People's Republic of China.

	Finally, Novotný announced that the Czechoslovak delegation firmly insists that the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China be finally enabled to participate in the work of the United Nations and that the Chiang Kai-shek elements be expelled from all agencies of the United Nations. We firmly oppose the so-called "two Chinas" theory created by Western countries in order to eke out the preservation of the bankrupt Chiang Kai-shek group and to forever separate Taiwan from China. We believe that the proposal of the US delegation included in the report of the General Committee is provocative and unacceptable. It once again confirms the imperialist and reactionary position held by the US government. We fully support the amendment proposed by the Nepalese and Guinean delegations, demanding that the current General Assembly discuss the issue of China's seat in the United Nations and immediately invite the representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend this meeting.

    就中国在联合国的代表权问题
    诺沃提尼在联大全体会议上发言
    新华社布拉格8日电捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国总统安·诺沃提尼3日在联合国大会全体会议上就中国在联合国的代表权问题发表了演说。
    诺沃提尼说：捷克斯洛伐克代表团完全支持苏联关于由十五届联合国大会讨论中国在联合国的席位问题的建议。我们认为，由美国提出而在总务委员会内通过的决议草案是继续奉行敌视中国政策的不体面表现。我们认为，联大应否决这一提案。与此相反，必须接受由尼泊尔和几内亚代表团所提出的、表达着所有对和平及联合国组织抱有真诚态度的人们的意愿的修正案。
    诺沃提尼说：恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利是刻不容缓的，因为当前国际局势的迫切问题，首先是全面彻底裁军问题的解决是刻不容缓的，而这些问题没有中华人民共和国代表的参与事实上是不可能顺利解决的。
    接着，诺沃提尼驳斥了美国代表对伟大的中国人民及其政府的诽谤和侮辱。
    诺沃提尼指出：中华人民共和国是强盛的社会主义大国，其生存的本质就决定它是个爱好和平的国家，在对外政策方面它主张和平共处原则，它完全有权参与联合国的全部活动。
    美国代表在这里谈到中华人民共和国的所谓侵略行为。他如此无耻地歪曲事实，真是令人感到惊讶。中华人民共和国毫不妥协地捍卫殖民地附属国人民的自由和独立权利。它谴责殖民主义者对刚果共和国的可耻进攻及联合国机构在那里扮演的不光彩角色。这种态度根本谈不上什么侵略，而是为和平事业服务的。
    中国人民帮助了兄弟的朝鲜人民抗击了美国及其盟国在被盗来的联合国的旗帜下所发动的残酷的军事行动。中华人民共和国政府积极地促成了朝鲜停战协定的签订，并且撤出了自己的人民志愿军，而美军则仍然留在南朝鲜，使这一地区的紧张局势继续保持，并阻挠朝鲜的和平统一。因而在朝鲜问题上持侵略态度的不是中华人民共和国而是美国。
    美军占领中国岛屿台湾已有十年，美军把台湾变成了反对中国大陆的原子和导弹基地，从而不仅威胁着中国人民的安全，也威胁着整个亚洲的和平。中华人民共和国要求美国占领者撤出台湾和其它中国岛屿——对于这些岛屿中国人民具有神圣的权利——谁想说这是侵略？
    中华人民共和国抗议对台湾的占领是完全理所当然的；它反对美国在台湾海峡的军事挑衅和美国军用飞机不断侵犯中国领空是完全理所当然的；它严正警告美国政府，如不终止这些挑衅行为，它们将带来灾难性后果是完全理所当然的。尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫在这里正确地对中国人民的耐心作了高度的评价，中国人民十年来一直试图用和平手段解放台湾。
    诺沃提尼说，事实证明，远东和太平洋地区紧张局势的根源决不是中华人民共和国，而是美国政府及其侵略政策。相反，我们认为中华人民共和国政府和人民的坚定立场是对于爱好和平的各国人民为阻止新战争而作的努力的重大贡献。例如今年，中华人民共和国政府一再建议在亚洲和太平洋地区各国之间缔结集体安全条约，建立无核武器地带；中华人民共和国政府今年与尼泊尔、缅甸、阿富汗等国政府缔结了和平、友好和互不侵犯条约。众所周知，中华人民共和国政府也与其它许多国家建立和加深着良好的关系，并努力争取通过会谈和协商的道路解决争端。
    诺沃提尼还驳斥了美国代表诬蔑中华人民共和国发动“反对外国政府和人民的充满仇恨的宣传运动”的说法。据美国代表说，“这一宣传运动的恶毒是史无前例的”，而其“主要对象是美国”。诺沃提尼说，这的确是令人奇怪的。如果中华人民共和国回答美国政府的不断挑衅并说出事情的真象来，这就被说成是“充满仇恨的宣传”。而各国代表团每天都读到美国的报纸、听到美国的广播、看到美国的电视，这当中他们见不到任何别的东西，见到的只是对于中华人民共和国和其它社会主义国家的蔑视、诽谤和侮辱。
    诺沃提尼提醒美国代表说，我们知道别的一些宣传周，这是美国所举行的一些反对社会主义国家的宣传周，它们的恶毒才真是史无前例的。我还想提醒一下，在离我国边境四十公里左右的地方有个所谓的
  “自由欧洲”电台，它不是整周，而是整年地散布充满仇恨的宣传，并且肆无忌惮地叫嚣。这个电台是用美国钱维持的，并且受到美国政府的支持。
    诺沃提尼又驳斥了美国发言人说中国人民生活在
  “精神的地狱”之中，并且“被鞭挞着去生产更多的财富”的诬蔑论调。诺沃提尼指出：中华人民共和国人民正继续沿着其几千年文化的道路前进，并且正好是在今天空前地发展着伟大的中国文化。这是一个极为美丽的、有着智慧、勤劳、谦虚和爱好和平的人民的国家。中国人民在其自由生活的十一年中创造出了奇迹。它正用不倦的劳动消除着殖民主义的沉重遗产。它建立着现代化工农业的基础。它战胜了饥饿和传染病，战胜了文盲。它的生活一年比一年更好、更富裕、更文明。像这样宏伟的事业，难道可能是美国代表所说的一个“无权的受奴役的人民”所做的吗？他是想向谁讲解自由？
    诺沃提尼指出，只要我们到纽约以南的几十或几百公里以外去看一看，我们就可以见到“只为白人”，
  “有色人禁止入内”及其它反动的种族主义、对人的尊严的最大侮辱和压制个性自由的表现。
    就是在纽约，某些非洲和其它国家的代表也亲身体验到这里的平等和自由是怎样一回事。在中华人民共和国以及在任何其它社会主义国家里你们是看不到任何这类现象的。那里存在着不分人的肤色和民族的真正自由。中华人民共和国政府在自己的领土上拯救了多少个非汉族的小民族，给了这些民族以权利，使他们得到了全面的发展。这就是关于中华人民共和国的真象，它是任何诽谤所不能掩盖的。
    接着，诺沃提尼谴责以美国政府为首的西方国家反对中华人民共和国的合法代表来到联合国。他说，美国害怕中华人民共和国的代表将促使联合国成为真正包罗万象的全世界性组织，使每个国家或每一类国家的呼声和观点都将在这里受到充分尊重，侮辱性的歧视和表决机器在这里无法存在，使那些企图消灭掉全人类呼吁予以实现的建议的幕后阴谋在这里无法存在。对于美国用这种方式来破坏联合国工作的进步的行动，必须予以终止。
    中国人民在这里没有席位，因此而吃亏的决不是中国人民。中国人民将继续坚定不移地沿着自己的道路走向自己国家的繁荣，任何侮辱是不能阻止它前进的。今天的状况受害的是联合国，它没有中华人民共和国参加就不能顺利解决许多迫切任务。
    最后，诺沃提尼宣布，捷克斯洛伐克代表团坚决主张最终地使中华人民共和国的合法代表有可能参与联合国的工作，把蒋介石分子从联合国的一切机构中赶出去。我们坚决反对西方国家为了苟延残喘地保存已破产了的蒋介石集团和永远把台湾从中国分裂出去而制造的所谓“两个中国”的理论。我们认为包括在总务委员会的报告中的美国代表团的建议是挑衅性的，是不可接受的。它又一次证实了美国政府所持的帝国主义的和反动的立场。我们完全支持尼泊尔和几内亚代表团所提出的修正案，要求本届联大讨论中国在联合国的席位问题并立刻邀请中华人民共和国的代表来出席这次会议。
