Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: Takasaki Tatsunosuke, the former chief representative of Japan who attended the Bandung Conference, held a farewell banquet at the Beijing Hotel tonight to entertain people from all walks of life in our country.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the banquet.

Takasaki Tatsunosuke spoke at the banquet. He said, "We sincerely thank Premier Zhou Enlai for his warm hospitality. We have been visiting Chinese soil for two weeks. We have personally witnessed the development of Chinese industry in the Northeast; we have contacted people from all walks of life and had sincere conversations about the relations between Japan and China, and we have benefited greatly."

Takasaki Tatsunosuke said, "The development of Chinese industry completely exceeded our imagination in Japan. We were very surprised, and I will tell my Japanese colleagues about the facts we have seen and heard."

Takasaki Tatsunosuke said, "At present, diplomatic relations between our two countries, Japan and China, have not yet been normalized. In order to explore this issue, I had a seven or eight hour conversation with Premier Zhou Enlai, and I gained a lot of inspiration in the conversation. Similarly, I have heard the same words in various parts of China, which is of great reference value to me and prompts me to think deeply. I think the reason for this is the lack of understanding of each other's true situation."

Takasaki Tatsunosuke said, "If possible, I hope that more Chinese people will visit Japan and more Japanese people will continue to visit China, so that we can further strengthen our understanding of each other. This may be a shortcut to strengthen the friendly relations between Japan and China."

Finally, Takasaki Tatsunosuke asked everyone to raise their glasses: "To the early establishment of Sino-Japanese friendship and to the increasing prosperity of China!"

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the banquet. He said, "I am very happy to attend Mr. Takasaki's farewell banquet and express my gratitude."

He said, "Mr. Takasaki visited some places in the Northeast and will visit Luoyang and Sanmenxia tomorrow. He said that you have indeed seen some of the achievements China has made in the eleven years since liberation. These achievements show that the Chinese people can only get rid of the long-term backward situation by building their motherland at the speed of the Great Leap Forward. On the other hand, our achievements are ultimately limited. In order to get rid of the long-term backward situation, we still need long-term efforts and a peaceful international environment and domestic unity. We are grateful to Mr. Takasaki for the frank opinions he put forward on China's construction work in personal conversations."

Premier Zhou said, "We agree that mutual visits, friendly exchanges, and mutual talks are of great benefit to promoting mutual understanding between the people of the two countries."

Premier Zhou emphasized that what the people of China and Japan are more concerned about is how to gradually restore normal relations between China and Japan, but at present, the solution to this problem is still encountering obstacles. I have said that the responsibility for this obstacle is not on the Chinese side. And I firmly believe that the vast majority of Japanese people are willing to promote friendship between the two countries, practice peaceful coexistence, and improve relations between the two countries. But where does the responsibility for hindering the normalization of relations between the two countries lie? This does not only come from foreign forces outside the two countries, but also a small group of people in Japan who are still hindering the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations today. This small group of people are the people in power in Japan today. The leaders of our Chinese government have always advocated the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, friendly exchanges with Japan, and peaceful coexistence. I would like to ask, can the current rulers of Japan adopt the same proposition? I don't think any of the Japanese friends present can guarantee this. This is what I am willing to frankly say to the Japanese friends present who are willing to promote Sino-Japanese friendship."

Premier Zhou said that he welcomed Mr. Takasaki's good wishes to devote his remaining years to restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and promoting Sino-Japanese friendship. He said that he believed that this good wish would be realized with the support of the broad masses of the Japanese people and the Chinese people.

Finally, Premier Zhou raised his glass and proposed a toast to the unity and friendship between Chinese and Japanese people, to the victory and development of the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, to the realization of Mr. Takasaki's good wishes, to the health of Mr. Takasaki, and to the health of the Japanese friends who accompanied Mr. Takasaki to visit our country.

Also attending the banquet were Guo Moruo, Liao Chengzhi, Zhang Xiruo, Cai Tingkai, Luo Guibo, Hu Yuzhi, Chu Tunan, Xu Guangping, Xu Zhizhen, Lian Guan, Tong Xiaopeng, Shen Bocun, Xue Muqiao, Shen Zijiu, Wei Zhenwu, Ouyang Yuqian, Wu Maosun, Xie Nanguang, Zhao Anbo, Xiao Fangzhou, Yong Longgui, Yang Zheng, Ding Tuo, as well as people from all walks of life in the capital.

    周总理在高碕达之助的告别宴会上说
    中国政府一向主张恢复中日邦交
    日本执政者阻碍中日关系正常化
    新华社24日讯　前出席万隆会议的日本首席代表高碕达之助，今晚在北京饭店举行告别宴会，招待我国各方面人士。
    周恩来总理，陈毅副总理出席了宴会。
    高碕达之助在宴会上讲话。他说，我们衷心感谢周恩来总理热情的款待。我们踏上中国的国土进行访问已经两个星期。我们在东北亲眼看到中国工业发展的情况；和各方面人士接触，推心置腹地交谈了日中两国关系问题，收益很大。
    高碕达之助说，中国工业发展的情况，完全超出我们在日本的想像，我们感到非常吃惊，我将把我们亲眼看到和听到的这些事实告诉我的日本的同事。
    高碕达之助说，现在我们日中两国的邦交还没有正常化。我们为了探讨这个问题，我曾和周恩来总理进行了七、八小时的交谈，在交谈中我得到了很大的启示。同样，我在中国各地也听到同样的话，这对我有很大的参考价值，促使我深思。我认为这个原因是，双方对彼此的真实情况缺乏了解。
    高碕达之助说，如果可能的话，希望有更多的中国人士访问日本，更多的日本人士继续访问中国，这样就能进一步加强彼此的了解，这样，也许是加强日中两国友好关系的捷径。
    高碕达之助最后请大家举杯：为早日建立日中友好关系、为中国日益繁荣干杯。
    周恩来总理在宴会上讲话。他说，我很高兴地参加高碕先生的告别宴会，并表示谢意。
    他说，高碕先生到东北参观了一些地方，明天又将去洛阳、三门峡等地参观访问。他说，你们在参观中确实看到了中国在解放十一年来所取得的一些成就。这些成就表明了，中国人民只有用大跃进的速度来建设祖国，才能摆脱长期落后的状况。另一方面，我们的成就究竟是有限的，为了摆脱长期落后的状况，我们还需要进行长期的努力，需要国际的和平环境和国内的团结一致。我们对高碕先生在个人交谈中，坦率地对中国建设工作所提出的意见表示感谢。
    周总理说，我们同意双方进行相互访问、友好往来、相互交谈，这对于促进两国人民的相互了解大有好处。
    周总理着重指出，但是，中日两国人民更关心的，是如何逐步恢复中日两国正常关系的问题，而在目前，这个问题的解决还遇到阻碍。我曾说过，这个阻碍的责任不在中国方面。我并且坚决相信，日本绝大多数人民是愿意促进两国友好、实行和平共处、改善两国关系的。但是，阻碍两国关系正常化的责任究竟在哪一方面呢？这不单是来自两国以外的外来力量，而且在日本方面也有一小撮人到今天还在阻碍中日关系正常化。这一小撮人是现在日本的执政的人们。我们中国政府的领导人，一向都是主张恢复中日邦交、同日本友好来往、和平共处的。我请问，日本今日的当权者能不能采取这同样主张呢？我看在座的日本朋友谁都不能保证。这是我愿意向在座的愿意促进中日友好的日本朋友率直说出的。
    周总理说，他对高碕先生愿意把他的余生为恢复中日邦交、促进中日友好而努力的良好愿望表示欢迎。他说，我相信，这种良好的心愿在广大的日本人民和中国人民的支持下，是一定能够实现的。
    周总理最后举杯，为中日两国人民团结友好、为万隆会议十项原则的胜利和发展、为高碕先生的良好愿望的实现、为高碕先生的健康、为随同高碕先生来我国访问的日本朋友们的健康干杯。
    出席宴会的还有郭沫若、廖承志、张奚若、蔡廷锴、罗贵波、胡愈之、楚图南、许广平、许之桢、连贯、童小鹏、申伯纯、薛暮桥、沈兹九、魏震五、欧阳予倩、吴茂荪、谢南光、赵安博、萧方洲、勇龙桂、杨正、丁拓，以及首都各方面人士。
