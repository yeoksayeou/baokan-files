According to the China Youth Daily: Cadre family member Zhang Yinhua listens to the Party, is loyal and devoted, leads by example, does not covet comfort and ease, does not fear hardship and difficulty, loves agricultural labor, is hardworking and simple, and has become a shock worker in building a new socialist countryside and a good example for cadre family members.

Zhang Yinhua is a member of the Nankeng Commune in Nanjing County, Fujian Province. Since 1954, she has been a member of the township (brigade) Communist Youth League branch and director of the women's association, and has been repeatedly named a model worker and producer.

"Let me stay in the township"

Yinhua is the daughter of a poor peasant family. She is twenty-five years old this year, and her husband, Ye Jian, is the director of the Nankeng Commune. In the spring of 1954, Wang Huaixin, the district party secretary, planned to send Yinhua to work in the district. When seeking her opinion, Yinhua thought for a moment and quickly said, "Secretary Wang, let me stay in the township! You see, there are few cadres in the township, and there is a shortage of labor. I grew up here, know how to work, and am familiar with the situation in the township. It is very suitable for me to stay. I am determined to work here for the rest of my life and build a good hometown with my fellow villagers." The district party secretary considered the situation in the township at the time and felt that Zhang Yinhua needed to stay, so he agreed with her.

Soon, Zhang Laixiang, who worked with Yinhua in the township, was transferred to work in the district. Some people said to Yinhua's face, "Laixiang has made progress and gone out to be a cadre; what about you? You are a township women's director and still moving earth at home." Yinhua calmly explained, "Farming is the need of the Party. If no one does it, where will everyone get food?" More than half a year later, the news that Yinhua's husband was becoming the district head spread to the township, and some people began to discuss that Yinhua would definitely not stay in the countryside this time. But ten days or half a month passed, and Yinhua remained the same as before, with no intention of going out. Other cadre family members in the village, led by Yinhua, also stayed in the countryside to build their hometown.

Hard work, high efficiency

Yinhua is an outstanding laborer. Regardless of the severe cold or heat, wind or rain, she always selflessly goes to the fields to work. In 1959, she was already the mother of three children, the oldest of whom was only five years old, and the youngest could not even walk. All the housework was done by her alone. The production team leader saw that she was not in good health and was burdened by children, so he only let her raise two oxen. However, Yinhua was not satisfied with this little work. In addition to feeding the cattle well, she also found ways to work in the fields. To solve the problem of the children's burden, she set up a nursery in the village. This not only enabled her to devote herself wholeheartedly to labor, but also enabled twelve women in the village with children to work in the fields.

In the past, raising cattle here always involved herding the cattle up the mountain for grazing in the morning and cutting grass for storage in the afternoon. The person watching the cattle did not work in the fields. Yinhua discovered that this was a waste of labor and was determined to change this situation through her own practice. When she went up the mountain to herd cattle in the morning, she brought a grass basket and a manure basket with her. After the cattle had eaten their fill, she also cut more than one hundred catties of grass and picked up a lot of cow dung. At the same time, she also automatically served as a water conservancy worker and a water watcher in the fields. Whenever she saw a ditch collapsing or a field ridge leaking, she would fix it. In this way, she could free up her hands in the afternoon to work in the fields with everyone. After the brigade party branch discovered this experience, it immediately promoted it to various production teams. Everyone said, "If Yinhua can do it, we can do it too." A high-efficiency competition movement to learn from Yinhua was launched in the brigade, squeezing out seventy laborers to engage in field labor. Since then, all aspects of the brigade's work have leapt into the ranks of advanced. That year, Yinhua herself earned more than two thousand four hundred work points; in the first six months of this year, she earned another one thousand four hundred work points, catching up with the level of general full labor in the local area. The commune members praised her, saying, "On the merit book of the Great Leap Forward, we should publicize Yinhua's name and give her a reward."

Suffering first, enjoying later

Yinhua always strictly demands herself as a family member of a revolutionary cadre and a glorious member of the Communist Youth League, suffering first and enjoying later, trying to find heavy work to do in labor, and trying to do the most difficult things. During the spring plowing and rice transplanting this year, the brigade universally promoted the "dipping rice roots" yield-increasing measure. This is a dirty and smelly job. The smell of pig manure and urine is suffocating. Yinhua thought to herself: the stinkier the manure, the more fertile it is, and the better it is for crop growth. Therefore, she took the initiative to ask to do this work, and she took on the task of "dipping rice roots" for more than one hundred mu of early rice in the entire team. Soon, the production team concentrated its labor force to launch a shock campaign to apply topdressing fertilizer. Applying topdressing fertilizer requires bending over all day and grabbing pig and cow manure by hand, which is dirty and tiring. Every day, Yinhua always said before the team leader could speak, "I'll go and apply topdressing fertilizer." There was a piece of mountain pit field in the team. It was said that there were insects in the field that would bite people, and women in the past did not dare to work in this kind of field. However, Yinhua said, "Let me do it." She rolled up her trouser legs and went into the field. Other sisters were moved and followed her into the field one by one. The team's topdressing fertilizer task was completed ahead of schedule with guaranteed quality and quantity.

Yinhua is just such a person. No matter what difficulties come her way, she always says with confidence, "I'll do it." This spring, the brigade party branch issued a call to all party members, league members, and cadres: "Everyone should take action to carry out high-yield early rice experiments, and be ambitious to remove the label of low-yield early rice." After careful consideration, Yinhua decided to organize young women to conduct high-yield experiments. She thought: in terms of production technology, experience, labor, and other conditions, the women in the team are indeed not as good as the men, but everything depends on human effort, and the field depends on people to cultivate it. As long as we listen to the Party and rely on the masses, unfavorable conditions can be turned into favorable conditions. Yes! That's how to do it! But at this time, some young women lacked confidence and were afraid that they would not do well and be ridiculed. Three days had passed, and there was still no progress on the experimental field. Yinhua ran to find Zhang Wansheng, the party branch secretary. Zhang Wansheng taught her: "Sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm must be combined with the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts. We must mobilize the masses to summarize rich harvest experiences and formulate a set of practical and reliable yield-increasing measures." Her heart was clear, and she was full of energy. In accordance with the Party's instructions, she invited Zhang Yazhu, an old farmer with rich production experience, as a consultant. After joint research, they adopted yield-increasing measures such as cultivating strong seedlings, deep plowing, applying sufficient fertilizer, and early insect control. Everyone saw that Yinhua was so determined, and the yield-increasing measures were implemented one by one, so their confidence was also sufficient. As a result, they finally overcame the disasters and created a miracle of high yield on a mountain more than a thousand meters high, becoming the highest early rice record in the commune this year. The team members said with great emotion, "High mountains can produce female top scholars, all thanks to the Party's good leadership."

Hardworking and simple, thrifty in managing the household

Yinhua is a good cadre and good housekeeper who lives a hardworking and simple life and is thrifty in managing the household. She is very strict with herself in life, and does not spend a penny carelessly or excessively. Over the years, she and her three children have been eating the same food in the cafeteria as the masses, and have never allowed her children to have any special treatment because she has more favorable economic conditions. The clothing of the three children is such that if the eldest cannot wear it, it is given to the second; after the second wears it, it is mended and remade, and then given to the third. Yinhua herself is the same. Except for going out or attending meetings, when she wears a better set of clothes, she always takes turns wearing those two sets of blue coarse cloth clothes that have been patched and patched again. She is also very frugal with other household expenses, saving as much as she can. She wrote to her husband, telling him to deposit the surplus money in the bank and not send money home.

    不贪图安逸享受　不畏惧艰苦困难
    干部家属张银花扎根家乡安心务农
    在她的影响下，许多干部家属都留在农村参加生产
    据中国青年报消息：干部家属张银花听党的话，忠心耿耿，以身作则，不贪图安逸享受，不畏惧艰苦困难，热爱农业劳动，艰苦朴素，成为建设社会主义新农村的突击手，干部家属的好榜样。
    张银花是福建省南靖县南坑公社的社员。1954年以来，她一直是乡（大队）团支部委员，妇女会主任，多次被评为工作、生产模范。
    “还是让我留在乡里吧”
    银花是个贫农家的女儿，今年二十五岁，爱人叶椷是南坑公社社长。1954年春，区委书记王怀信同志，打算派银花到区上工作。征求她的意见时，银花听后想了想，连忙说：“王书记，还是让我留在乡里吧！你看，乡里干部少，劳动力又缺，我从小在这里土生土长，又会劳动，对乡里情况又熟悉，我留下来顶合适，决心在这里干一辈子，和乡亲们一起建设好家乡。”区委书记考虑到当时乡里的情况，觉得张银花需要留下，就同意了她的意见。
    不久，同银花一起在乡里工作的张莱香，调到区上工作了。有的人就当着银花面说：“人家莱香进步，出去当干部了；你呢？是个乡妇女主任，还在家里搬田土。”银花心平气和地解释说：“种田是党的需要，如果没人来干，大家吃饭哪里来？”时隔半年多，银花爱人当区长的消息传到了乡里，有的人又议论起来，说这一次银花准在农村呆不住了。但十天半月过去了，银花却和往常一样，丝毫没有外出的打算。村里其他干部家属，在银花的带动下，也都安心留在农村建设家乡。
    勤劳动，高工效
    银花劳动是出色的，不管是严寒酷暑，风里雨里，她总是忘我地下田劳动。1959年，她已是三个孩子的妈妈，最大的孩子才五岁，最小的还不会走路。家务事，全靠她一人。生产队长看她身体不好，又有孩子的拖累，就只让她饲养二条耕牛。可是，银花却不满足于这一点活。她除了喂好牛以外，还生办法到田里去劳动。为了解决孩子的拖累，她在村里办起了托儿所。这不仅使她能够一心一意参加劳动，而且还使村里十二个有孩子的妇女，也能下田劳动了。
    过去这里养牛，总是上午赶牛上山放牧，下午割草存栏，看牛的人不下田劳动。银花发现这样作对劳动力有浪费，决心通过自己实践，来改变这一情况。她上午上山放牛时，就随身带上草篮和粪箕，等到牛吃饱了，她也割了一百多斤青草，并拾到很多牛粪。同时，她还自动兼任水利员和田间的看水员，不管是哪个生产队的水沟崩塌，田埂漏水，她只要看到，就动手把它修好。这样，她下午就可以腾出手来，和大伙一块下田劳动。这一经验，大队党总支发现后，立即推广到各生产队，大家都说：“银花能做到，我们也能做到。”一个学银花赶银花的高工效竞赛运动，在大队开展起来，挤出了七十个劳动力从事田间劳动。从此，大队项项工作都跃入先进行列。这一年，银花自己做了二千四百多个工分；今年头六个月，她又做了一千四百个工分，赶上当地一般全劳力的水平。社员们都称赞说：“在大跃进的功劳簿上，应该给我们银花扬个名，立个功。”
    吃苦在先，享受在后
    银花总是以一个革命干部的家属和一个光荣的共青团员，来严格要求自己，吃苦在先，享受在后，在劳动中尽找重活干，尽找最难的事情做。今年春耕插秧时，大队普遍推广“沾秧根”这项增产措施。这是一项又脏又臭的工作，猪粪尿，臭味直呛人。银花心想：粪越臭越肥，对庄稼生长越好。因而她就主动要求干这活，全队早稻一百多亩“沾秧根”，她都一人包下来干了。不久，生产队集中劳力，突击中耕追根肥。追根肥要整天弯腰哈背，用手抓猪牛粪，又脏又累。每天，银花不等队长开口总是先说：“我去追根肥。”队里有片山坑田，听说田里有种虫子会咬人，妇女过去都不敢下这种田劳动，然而银花却说：“让我去干。”她裤脚一卷，下田去了。其他姊妹受到感动，也一个个地跟着下田。全队中耕追肥任务，保质保量提前完成。
    银花就是这样一个人，不管什么困难到她面前，她都是满怀信心坚定地说：“我干。”今年春天，大队党支部向全体党团员、干部发出号召：“人人动手大搞早稻高产试验，立雄心大志摘掉早稻低产帽子。”银花细细地琢磨后，她决定组织青年妇女搞高产试验。她想：论生产技术、经验、劳力等条件，队里妇女的确不如男的，但是事在人为，田在人种，只要听党的话，依靠群众，不利条件可以变为有利条件。对！就这样干！但这时有些青年妇女，却信心不足，怕搞不好，惹人讥笑。时间已经过去三天了，试验田的事还没有头绪。银花跑去找党支部书记张万盛。张万盛教育她：“冲天的革命干劲，要与科学的求实精神相结合，要发动群众总结丰产经验，订出一套切实可靠的增产措施。”她心里明亮了，浑身都是劲。遵照党的指示，请了有丰富生产经验的老农张亚柱当顾问，经过共同研究，采取了育壮秧，深翻土，下足肥，早除虫等增产措施。大家看到银花那样的坚定，增产措施又条条落实了，信心也都足了。结果，她们终于战胜了灾害，在一千多米的高山上，创造了丰产奇迹，成为公社今年早稻最高纪录。队员们感慨万分地说：“高山能出女状元，全靠党的好领导。”
    艰苦朴素　勤俭持家
    银花是一个生活艰苦朴素，勤俭持家的好干部、好当家。她在生活上对自己要求非常严格，一分钱不乱花不多花。几年来，她和她的三个孩子，一直和群众一样，在食堂吃同样的饭菜，从来不因为自己有较优越的经济条件，让孩子有一点特殊。三个小孩的衣着是，老大不能穿，就给老二；老二穿了加以缝补翻制，再给老三。银花自己也是这样，除了出门或开会，穿一套较好的衣服外，总是轮替穿着那两套补了又补的蓝色粗布衣服。家里其他费用，她也是能省就省，非常节俭。她写信告诉爱人，把节余的钱存入银行，不要寄钱回家。（附图片）
