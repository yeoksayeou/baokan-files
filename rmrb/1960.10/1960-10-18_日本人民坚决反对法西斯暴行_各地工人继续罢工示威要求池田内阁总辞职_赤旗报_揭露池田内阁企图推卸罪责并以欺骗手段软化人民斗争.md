The meeting decided that during the general election, "All-Japan Farmers" will focus on safeguarding the basic interests of farmers, and will fight for the thorough opposition to the "Basic Agricultural Law" proposed by the Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party.

On the 15th, 800 representatives of the newly established youth organization of the Socialist Party, the "Japan Socialist Youth League," participated in the protest march against the assassination of Asanuma held by people from all walks of life on the same day after holding an inaugural meeting in Tokyo.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: Tokyo - The Japanese Communist Party's organ newspaper, "Akahata," published an editorial today, exposing the Ikeda Cabinet's attempt to shirk responsibility for the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, and its conspiracy to soften the people's struggle through deceptive means. It also demanded the immediate removal of the Director-General of the National Police Agency and the Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police Department.
The editorial pointed out that the Japanese people's wave of anger protesting the reactionaries' assassination of Asanuma is rising higher and higher. The Ikeda Cabinet and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are currently anxiously taking deceptive measures to quell the people's anger. Although National Public Safety Commission Chairman Iwao Yamazaki resigned, his successor, Hideo Shuto, rejected the Japanese people's request to dismiss Ken Ogura, the Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police Department, and Kashiwamura, the Director-General of the National Police Agency. The editorial pointed out that the Ikeda Cabinet's attitude of fooling the Japanese people is absolutely intolerable.

"Akahata" revealed that after the National Public Safety Commission held a meeting on the 13th, it claimed that the responsibility for Asanuma's assassination did not lie with the police personnel. The newspaper pointed out that in this way, the characteristics of the National Public Safety Commission as an agent of the reactionaries were fully exposed.

"Akahata" demanded the democratization of the National Public Safety Commission and demanded that the current members of the committee immediately resign to take responsibility.
