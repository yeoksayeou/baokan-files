    Three Crops a Year, Great Potential
    Not long ago, we saw the news that Bobai County in Guangxi Province reformed its farming system, changing from two crops a year to three, thereby achieving a substantial increase in production. Today's news in this newspaper about Donghu Farm in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, and Yancang Commune in Nanhui County, Shanghai, promoting the planting of a crop of wheat-like spring harvest crops on double-cropping rice land further proves that not only in the subtropical regions of southern China can we change from two crops a year to three, but also in many areas of central China, it is possible to do so.
    Reforming the farming system, changing from two crops a year to three, is a very important measure to further unleash the potential of the land, give play to people's subjective initiative, and strive for a substantial increase in agricultural production. In order to win a summer harvest next year that exceeds any previous year, we should give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, mobilize the strength of the broad masses of commune members, compete with the heavens for time, compete with the land for profit, and plant an additional season of summer harvest crops in all areas where conditions permit.
    Making grain crops change from two crops a year to three is the result of the rapid development of agricultural productive forces in our country. It is the result of the broad masses of rural cadres and people, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, displaying the spirit of daring to think, daring to act, courageously innovating, boldly creating, and proceeding from the specific conditions of the local area, working diligently, and taking practical measures. Nature can provide people with unlimited wealth, it just depends on whether people dare and have the means to extract it. Planting three crops on one piece of land, calculating their total growth period requires a total of 395 days, but there are only 365 days in a year. How can three crops a year be achieved? This was the first problem encountered by Donghu Farm in Shaoxing when experimenting with three crops a year. If we followed old habits and looked at problems with old eyes, we would of course think that this was simply impossible. But the employees of Donghu Farm were not like this. They were not frightened by this problem and stopped moving forward; nor were they bound by old habits and at the mercy of nature; but instead, they gave full play to people's subjective initiative, carefully explored and grasped the laws of crop growth, and strived to make nature obey people's command. After many experiments and painstaking research, they finally shortened the growth period of early rice in the paddy fields by cultivating strong and healthy seedlings, skillfully applying fertilizer, and strengthening field management, smoothly resolving the contradiction between the three-crop system and the seasons. At the same time, the labor problem caused by adding a crop season was also properly solved through the rational matching of crop varieties and the arrangement of crop rotations.
    Changing from two crops a year to three is a major reform in the farming system, involving a wide range of aspects, and must be comprehensively arranged with foresight. A series of issues such as the fertilizer, labor, tools, seeds, and new cultivation techniques required for planting an additional season of crops, as well as the layout of crops throughout the year in the region, must be properly resolved. Only in this way can this reform be placed on a solid and reliable foundation.
    The farming season for planting an additional season of summer harvest crops is already very tight. All areas that have the conditions to do so should seize the time to carry out various preparations, work hard to plant this season's crops well, and win a bumper harvest next summer.

### 一年三熟  大有可为

    一年三熟  大有可为
    不久前，我们曾看到广西博白县改革耕作制度，变一年两熟为三熟，从而获得大幅度增产的消息。今天本报发表的浙江绍兴县东湖农场、上海市南汇县推广盐仓公社在双季稻的土地上增种一茬麦类春收作物新闻进一步证明：不仅在我国南部的亚热带地区可以变一年两熟为三熟，就是在我国中部的许多地区，也能够这样做。
    改革耕作制度，由一年两熟变为一年三熟，是进一步发挥土地潜力，发挥人的主观能动性，争取农业大幅度增产的一项很重要的措施。为了明年夺得超过任何一年的夏季收成，我们应该充分发挥人民公社的优越性，动员广大社员的力量，与天争时，与地争利，在一切有条件的地区尽可能增种一季夏收作物。
    使粮食作物由一年两熟变为一年三熟，是我国农业生产力迅速发展的结果，是广大农村干部和群众在总路线光辉照耀下，发扬了敢想敢干的勇于革新、大胆创造的精神，和从当地的具体情况出发，刻苦钻研、采取切实措施的结果。大自然能够给人提供无限的财富，就看人们敢不敢和有没有办法向它索取。在一块土地上种三季庄稼，计算起来它们的生长期总共需要三百九十五天，但是一年却只有三百六十五天，怎么能作到一年三熟呢？这是绍兴东湖农场在试验一年三熟时所首先遇到的问题。如果按旧习惯办事，拿老眼光看问题，当然会认为这是根本不可能作到的。但是东湖农场的职工们不是这样的，他们没有被这个难题吓住而止步不前；也不受旧习惯的束缚，听命大自然的摆布；而是高度发挥人的主观能动作用，精心探索和掌握农作物生长的规律，努力让大自然听从人的支配。他们经过多方试验和刻苦钻研，终于用培育老壮秧、巧施肥料和加强田间管理等办法，缩短了早稻在本田的生长期，顺利地解决了三熟制耕作和季节的矛盾。同时对于增加一季作物而产生的劳力问题，也通过合理配搭作物品种和安排茬口，得到了妥善的解决。
    一年两熟改三熟是耕作制度上的重大改革，涉及的方面很广，必须瞻前顾后，加以全面地安排。对于增种一季农作物所需要的肥料、劳力、工具、种籽和新的耕作技术，以及本地区全年农作物的布局等一系列的问题，都要加以妥善地解决。只有如此，才能把这种改革放在切实可靠的基础上。
    增种一季夏收作物，农时季节已经很紧迫了。凡是有条件这样作的地区，应该抓紧时间，进行各项准备工作，努力把这一季作物种好，夺取明年夏季的丰收。
