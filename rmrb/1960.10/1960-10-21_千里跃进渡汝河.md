	A Thousand Li Leap Across the Ru River
	Xiao Yongyin
	In August 1947, after our Liu-Deng army annihilated nine and a half brigades of the Chiang bandit army in Southwestern Shandong, we followed Chairman Mao's instructions to draw the war to the Chiang-controlled areas, and began the epic feat of leaping a thousand li into the Dabie Mountains.
	The torrent of the advance crossed the Central Plains battlefield, marching day and night without ceasing. My brigade, as the vanguard of the column, cleared the way through mountains and built bridges over water, opening the way forward for the entire army. After more than ten consecutive days of marching and fighting, we crossed the Longhai Railway, traversed the Yellow River flooded area, crossed the Sha River and the Hong River, and arrived at the north bank of the Ru River on the night of August 23.
	The Ru River is a large river in central Henan Province, with water more than ten feet deep, a deeply concave riverbed, and steep banks on both sides. Before our army arrived, the enemy had dragged away and destroyed all the boats near the ferry. Unable to wade across and unable to find a ferry in time, the troops stopped on the north bank. The engineer company and reconnaissance company were dispatched to search for ferries along the river bank; the fighters of the combat companies were also searching for floating materials in nearby villages, actively preparing to build pontoon bridges.
	Early the next morning, enemy planes flew low over the Ru River, strafing and bombing indiscriminately. At noon, on the highway west of the river's opposite bank, dust flew, and people shouted and horses neighed. Standing on the bank, we raised our binoculars and saw that the enemy's artillery, infantry, cars, and carriages stretched from west to east, endlessly. The enemy occupied the line from Youfangdian to Runanbu.
	The sudden appearance of this large number of enemies increased the resistance to our advance, and the pursuing troops behind were also closing in, making the situation suddenly tense. We analyzed the enemy and our situation, believing that if we allowed the enemy to set up defenses before crossing the river, we would be completely passive. We must not delay, we must cross the river immediately, think of all possible ways to cross the river, even if it's just one platoon that gets across to occupy a village!
	The urgent task of crossing the river was given to the first battalion of the 52nd Regiment. The commanders and fighters of the first battalion were very determined, but there were many difficulties. They searched all morning and found only a small wooden boat. This boat could only carry one squad at a time, so it was obviously not enough. The soldiers then tied rafts with wood and sorghum stalks. The enemy discovered our intentions, and planes, artillery, and machine guns concentrated their fire on us. Columns of water were stirred up in the river, and the surface of the river was like a rainstorm. Our soldiers all understood the importance of this crossing. Under the cover of the regiment's various weapons, they bravely jumped onto the small boats and rafts. Many soldiers who could swim simply took off their coats and swam to the other side, holding onto wood.
	More than ten minutes later, the first batch of soldiers who rushed to cross the river landed and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy at Daleigang. Subsequent troops continued to increase on the other side. While the 52nd Regiment was rushing to cross the river, the engineer company of my brigade and the engineer company of the 16th Brigade, braved the artillery fire and were busily building a pontoon bridge. At this time, the two banks of the Ru River were filled with smoke. The bridge-building soldiers all understood that the bridge concerned the fate of our army. No one cared about the planes and artillery. Build the bridge, everything for building the bridge. Columns of water hit them in the face, they shook off the water and continued to work! One soldier fell, and another immediately took over.
	At more than three o'clock in the afternoon, a pontoon bridge spanning the river was finally built. Large numbers of follow-up troops ran across the pontoon bridge and headed for the south bank, where the bullets were flying. Only then did we breathe a slight sigh of relief.
	Before dusk, the entire 52nd Regiment had crossed the river, and the foothold at Daleigang was consolidated. From the prisoners, we learned that the south bank of the Henan River was occupied by Wu Shaozhou's unit of the enemy's 85th Army. The enemy had formed a line across an area tens of miles long in front of our army, cutting off our army's southward route. Although our vanguard had crossed the river, it was still difficult to advance in the face of a large enemy.
	At nightfall, the brigade headquarters advanced to a small village very close to the bridge. The troops of each regiment also gathered near the river one after another. Li Zhen, the political commissar of the brigade, and I went to the riverside together. We stood side by side, looking towards the south bank: the enemy's fire in the villages stretching tens of miles from Youfangdian to Runanbu illuminated half the sky. How many enemies were behind this fire that stretched for tens of miles? This was a mystery. What should we do next? Attack? We couldn't figure out the enemy's situation. We reported the new situation to the column leaders, but hadn't received any instructions yet. Wait? If the enemy continued to reinforce and set up defenses, it would be even more difficult during the day. Both Li Zhen and I felt the heavy burden on our shoulders, silently watching the other side of the river, anxiously awaiting instructions from our superiors.
	After a while, Deputy Commander Wei of the column arrived, and with him was Brigade Commander You Taizhong. As we were discussing the situation, a staff officer came to report: Commander Liu Bocheng and Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping had arrived. This made us unexpectedly happy. Based on past experience, whenever Liu and Deng came, there must be an important situation. We immediately ran over, and saw that Political Commissar Du of the column had also arrived.
	We led the leaders into the small thatched cottage of the brigade headquarters. Before they could sit down, Commander Liu asked, "What's the situation?"
	I reported the current situation, and Commander Liu nodded slightly after listening.
	Political Commissar Deng said to Chief of Staff Li Da, "Okay, open the map and talk about the situation first."
	The map was spread out under the oil lamp, and we gathered around it. Chief of Staff Li Da pointed to the map and introduced: "The enemy is using more than a dozen divisions to pursue us from behind. Now, the enemy's 58th, 48th divisions and other three reorganized divisions are only fifty miles away from us. In front of our army, the enemy's 85th Army is blocking the way. The enemy's intention is to hold our main force and fight a decisive battle with us between the Hong River and the Ru River, attempting to disrupt our strategic plan to advance into the Dabie Mountains..."
	It seemed that the current situation was more serious than we had anticipated. Now, we were truly facing strong enemies in front and pursuing troops behind. Everyone looked at Commander Liu and Political Commissar Deng in unison. Outside the small thatched cottage, the sound of exploding shells rang out from time to time.
	"That's the situation," Commander Liu said calmly, "If we let the enemy behind catch up and sandwich us in the middle, it will not only affect the entire action plan, but also put our army in an unfavorable position. We must take offensive measures and open a passage from here (he drew a line on the map with his hand). No matter how many planes and artillery the enemy has, we must advance and we must realize Chairman Mao's strategic plan..."
	Commander Liu's words made me feel full of strength. My brigade, since the battle in Southwestern Shandong, had full personnel and sufficient ammunition. With Chairman Mao's wise decisions and the personal command of Liu and Deng, we would definitely be able to guarantee the completion of the task. Even if there was a mountain of knives in front of us, we would flatten it and walk over it.
	A burst of intense gunfire and artillery fire came from the south bank of the Henan River. It sounded like it was very close to the bridgehead. Could it be that the enemy was coming to seize the bridge again? Since the afternoon, the enemy had tried to seize the bridge three times. I became nervous. The bridge, this small pontoon bridge, was related to the entire action plan! Just as I was worried, a communicator from the engineer company ran over and said: "The enemy attacked the bridge for the fourth time just now, and was repelled again."
	Good! As long as the bridge is in our hands, everything will be easy.
	After receiving the instructions from Liu and Deng, Political Commissar Du of the column gave specific instructions to Brigade Commander You Taizhong and myself: My brigade would break out from the center of the enemy, resist the enemies on both sides, attack and advance, and ensure the safe passage of the Field Headquarters and the directly subordinate units of the column; You's brigade would take over the defense of my 52nd Regiment, hold Daleigang and Xiaoleigang, protect the pontoon bridge, and cover the army's crossing of the river.
	After the specific deployment was determined, we heard Liu and Deng say that they would walk with us all the way, and we felt quite uneasy. It was conceivable that on the road we were going to clear, there were enemies on both sides, and the road we would be walking on would be within the range of the enemy's artillery fire. It was too unsafe for the leaders to walk with us all the way. Therefore, we suggested to Liu and Deng that they take the road from the 17th Brigade.
	"Don't worry about us," Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping said, "Go and fight quickly, you must break a path out from the middle of the enemy."
	"Remember!" Commander Liu Bocheng raised his voice slightly and solemnly instructed: "Now is 'the brave wins when two armies meet', be brave, be fierce, understand?"
	"Understood!" After I replied, I saluted the leaders, turned and walked out of the thatched cottage.
	After the task was conveyed, many battalions and companies requested to take on the task of the vanguard, to be the pioneers. The river bank was filled with a boiling sound. The soldiers were all spreading the heroic words "the brave wins when two armies meet."
	The requirements of the brigade to each regiment were also resolute and clear, that is: regardless of all sacrifices, at any cost, no matter how fierce the planes and artillery were, we must break a path and ensure the realization of the strategic plan of leaping into the Dabie Mountains and inserting into the enemy's heart! In terms of tactical means, the measures we took were: each regiment was arranged in a sequence of one to nine companies, forming four columns to attack and advance. Each rifle was equipped with a bayonet, and each grenade was opened, and we would fight when we encountered the enemy. The vanguard would not leave behind a small stronghold or an enemy wherever they passed.
	At more than two o'clock in the night, the troops set out. The 52nd Regiment and the 53rd Regiment were the first echelon, fighting side by side along Daleigang to the south; the 54th Regiment was the second echelon. The two assault regiments had only advanced for half an hour when intense gunfire and grenade sounds rang out. After a while, reports came from the front: the first village had been occupied. In order to directly grasp the situation of the assault troops, Political Commissar Li Zhen and I went to the two assault regiments separately.
	The dark night sky was illuminated by the flames of war. Everywhere were tracer bullets and flares. Gunfire and shouts of killing were heard in the two villages in front. Reflected in the fire set by the enemy, countless figures of soldiers flashed, jumped, charged, and fought under the firelight. The battle was extremely fierce.
	After taking a village, we rushed to another village. We really fought when we encountered the enemy, and we charged forward after the fight. The telephone soldiers were busy, constantly collecting and laying lines. Reports came in one after another from the phone: Wuzhuang was taken! ... Chehuanzhuang was taken! Xiaozhangzhuang was taken! ...
	Before dawn, our army had successively captured more than a dozen villages on the road ahead. The enemy became like frightened birds, running away in a panic. Our army did not give them a chance to breathe, following closely behind, pressing south with all our strength. Along the way, there were enemy wounded and corpses, cars and artillery everywhere. When the east brightened, our army opened a passage more than ten miles long and six or seven miles wide.
	When the two assault regiment commanders reported that there were no large enemy forces in front, we breathed a sigh of relief: the passage was opened! We reported to Liu and Deng, and at the same time readjusted the deployment: ordering the 52nd Regiment and the 53rd Regiment to spread out on both sides of the passage, to be like a solid dam, resolutely resist the enemy's counterattacks on both sides, and ensure the safety of the passage. At the same time, we transferred the first battalion of the 54th Regiment to the front, changing the rear guard to the vanguard, sweeping and advancing. I personally took the place of the battalion commander, the regiment commander went down to the company, and the battalion commander went down to the squad. This battalion was a very strong battalion, with more than 700 people, all equipped with new weapons captured in the Southwestern Shandong campaign. The soldiers were in high spirits and put up their bayonets.
	"What do we do when we encounter the enemy?" I asked everyone as I walked in the ranks. An echo immediately rang in my ears:
	"Fight with bayonets!"
	"Destroy as many as we can!"
	"..."
	The fiery red sun leaped out of the horizon, illuminating our way forward. Although the enemies on both sides desperately counterattacked, they were beaten down by our two regiments on both sides time and time again. Finally, the enemy dispatched planes to cooperate with ground artillery, bombing and strafing our passage. However, all this was to no avail and could not stop us from advancing. The army flowed like a flood that breached a dam towards the southwest.
	"The brave wins when two armies meet." Our army won. The enemy's dream of annihilating our army on both banks of the Ru River was completely shattered.
	At about 2:00 PM the next day, we victoriously arrived at the planned assembly point, Pengdian. The troops rested for a few hours, ate their fill, and were in high spirits and full of energy. At dusk, we shouldered new missions and set out for Xixian and the Huai River ferry.

    千里跃进渡汝河
    萧永银
    1947年8月，我刘、邓大军在鲁西南连歼蒋匪军九个半旅以后，遵照毛主席的指示，把战争引向蒋管区，开始了千里跃进大别山的壮举。
    进军的洪流，横越中原战场，日夜不息地前进。我旅为纵队先遣部队，逢山开路，遇水搭桥，为全军开辟前进的道路。经过连续十几天的行军作战，跨过陇海路，涉过黄泛区，渡过了沙河、洪河，于8月23日夜晚到达了汝河北岸。
    汝河，是河南省中部的一条大河，水深丈余，河床深凹，两岸陡峭。在我军到达之前，敌人把渡口附近的船只通通拖走、砸毁了。徒涉不能，一时又找不到渡船，部队便在北岸停了下来。工兵连、侦察连分头出动，沿着河岸寻找渡船；战斗连队的战士也在附近村里找寻漂浮器材，积极作架设浮桥的准备。
    第二天一早，敌人的飞机在汝河上空低飞扫射，滥施轰炸。中午时分，河对岸西面的公路上，尘土飞扬，人喊马嘶。我们站在岸上，举起望远镜看，只见敌人的炮兵、步兵、汽车、马车黑压压地从西到东，不见尽头，从油坊店、汝南埠一线，全被敌人占领了。
    这突然出现的大批敌人，增加了我们前进的阻力，后面追兵又正在迫近，情况骤然紧张起来。我们分析了敌我态势，认为如果让敌人布好防再过河，就会完全陷于被动状态。绝不能迟延，要立即过河，想尽一切办法过河，就是先过去一个排，占领一个村庄也好啊！
    紧急渡河的任务交给了五十二团一营。一营的指战员决心很大，但困难很多。他们找了一上午，仅仅找到了一条小木船。这条船，一次只能载一个班，光靠它显然是不行的。战士们便用木头、高粱秸扎木筏子。敌人发现了我们的企图，飞机大炮、机枪集中向我们轰击，河水掀起了一条条水柱，河面像下暴雨一样。我们的战士都懂得这次渡河关系重大，在团的各种武器掩护下，奋勇地跳上小船和筏子。许多会泅水的战士，干脆把外衣一脱，抱着木头向对岸游去。
    十几分钟以后，第一批抢渡的战士登岸了，和在大雷岗的敌人展开了混战。后续部队不停地向对岸增加。在五十二团抢渡的同时，我旅工兵连和十六旅工兵连，冒着炮火，紧张地架设浮桥。此时，汝河两岸打得烟雾腾空，架桥的战士都懂得，桥，是关乎我军的命运，谁也顾不得飞机、大炮了。架桥，一切为了架桥。水柱劈头盖脸打过来，他们抖一抖身上的水，再干！一个战士倒下去了，另一个立即接上去。
    下午三点多钟，一座横跨河面的浮桥终于架设成了。大批后续部队跑过浮桥，奔向弹火纷飞的南岸。我们这才稍稍地松了一口气。
    黄昏前，五十二团全部过了河，大雷岗的立脚地巩固了。从俘虏口中得知：河南岸是敌八十五军吴绍周部，该敌在我军正面数十里长的地区摆成一线，切断了我军南下的道路。我军先头部队虽然渡过了河，但在大敌面前，向前推进仍然困难。
    天黑时，旅指挥所前进到离桥很近的小村里。各团的部队也先后集结到河边上。旅政治委员李震同志同我一块到了河边上，我们并肩站着，向河南观望：从油坊店到汝南埠连绵几十里的村庄，敌人放的大火，照亮了半个天空。这几十里长的火光后面，到底还有多少敌人？这是个谜。下一步该怎么办呢？打过去？摸不清敌人的底。新的情况报告给纵队首长后，还没得到指示。等吗？如果敌人继续增兵力，布好防务，一到白天就更难办了。我和李政委都感到肩上的担子沉重，默默地望着对岸，焦急地等待上级的指示。
    不一会，纵队韦副司令来了，和他一块来的，还有尤太忠旅长。我们正交谈着情况，一个参谋同志来报告：刘伯承司令员和邓小平政委到了。这使我们意外高兴。根据以往经验，凡是刘、邓首长来到，一定有重要情况。我们立即跑去，只见纵队杜政委也来了。
    把首长引进旅指挥所的小草屋里，还没坐下，刘司令员问道：“情况怎么样？”
    我把当前的情况作了报告，刘司令员听后微微点头。
    邓政委向李达参谋长说：“好，打开地图，先把情况谈谈。”
    地图在油灯下展开，我们围上去，李达参谋长指着地图介绍说：“敌人正以十几个师的兵力，从背后向我追击。现在，敌人五十八、四十八师等三个整编师，距离我们只有五十余里，我军正面则有敌人八十五军挡住去路。敌人的企图，是想拉住我军主力，在洪河、汝河之间与我决战，企图打乱我进军大别山的战略计划……”
    看来，当前的情况，比我们预料的要严重得多。现在真是前有强敌，后有追兵。大家不约而同地望着刘司令员和邓政委。小草屋外，不时响起炮弹的炸裂声。
    “情况就是这样”，刘司令员镇静地说：“如果让后面的敌人赶上，把我们夹在中间，不但影响整个行动计划，而且会使我军处于不利地位。我们要采取进攻手段，从这里（他用手在地图上一划）打开一条通路，不管敌人有多少飞机大炮，我们一定要前进，一定要实现毛主席的战略计划。……”
    刘司令员的话，使我感到全身都是力量。我旅自鲁西南战斗后，人员齐备，弹药充足，有毛主席英明的决策，有刘、邓首长亲自指挥，一定能保证完成任务。面前就是一座刀山，我们也要踏平它，从上边走过去。
    河南岸传来一阵激烈的枪炮声，听起来好像离桥头很近，会不会敌人又来抢桥呀？从下午到现在，敌人来抢过三次了。我心里紧张起来。桥，这座小小的浮桥，它关系着整个行动计划呀！正在着急，工兵连一个通信员跑来说：“刚才敌人第四次抢桥，又被击退了。”
    好！只要桥在我们手上，一切就好办了。
    接受了刘、邓首长的指示后，纵队杜政委又向我和尤太忠旅长具体交代了任务：我旅从敌人正中杀出去，抗住两边的敌人，攻击前进，保证野司和纵队直属队安全通过；尤旅接替我五十二团防务，固守大、小雷岗，保护浮桥，掩护全军渡河。
    具体部署确定后，我们听到刘、邓首长说要随同我们一路走，心里颇不安宁。可以设想打出的道路，两侧都是敌人，我们走的道，将在敌人的炮火射程以内，首长随同我们一路走太不安全了。因此，我们向刘、邓首长建议，请他们从十七旅那边走。
    “不要管我们，”邓小平政委说：“快去打仗，一定要从敌人中间打出一条路。”
    “要记住！”刘伯承司令员略微提高了声音，又严肃地嘱咐说：“现在是‘两军相逢勇者胜’，要勇，要猛明白吗？”
    “明白！”我回答后，向首长敬过礼，转身走出草房。
    任务传达下去后，许多营、连纷纷请战，要求担负尖刀任务，当开路先锋。河岸上一片沸腾声，战士们都互相传诵着“两军相逢勇者胜”的豪语。
    旅对各团的要求，也提得坚决、明确，那就是：不顾一切牺牲，不惜任何代价，不管白天黑夜，不论飞机大炮多猛烈，一定要杀出一条路，保证实现跃进大别山，插入敌人心脏的战略计划！在战术手段上，我们采取的措施是：各团以一至九连的序列，排成四路纵队，攻击前进。每条步枪都装上刺刀，每颗手榴弹都揭开盖，遇上敌人就打。先头部队所过之处，不留下一个小据点，不留下一个敌人。
    夜里两点多钟，部队出动了。五十二团、五十三团为第一梯队，并肩沿大雷岗向南打；五十四团作二梯队。两个突击团开进只半小时，激烈的枪声、手榴弹声响起来。不一会，前边传来报告：第一个村占领了。为了直接掌握突击部队的情况，我和旅政委李震同志，分头下到两个突击团。
    漆黑的夜空被战火照亮了。到处是曳光弹、信号弹。前边两个村子里响着枪声和喊杀声。映着敌人放起的大火，无数个战士的身影在火光下闪动、跳跃、冲杀。战斗十分激烈。
    打下一个村庄，又扑向另一个村庄，真是碰上敌人就打，打完就往前插。可忙坏了电话兵，他们不停地收线、架线，电话中接连传来报告：五庄打下了！……车桓庄打下了！小张庄打下了！……
    天亮之前，我军连续攻占了前进路上的十几个村庄。敌人变成了惊弓之鸟，狼狈地向后逃跑。我军不给它喘息机会，脚跟着脚，一股劲地向南压。一路上，满是敌人的伤兵和尸体，汽车和大炮。东方发亮时，我军便打开了一条长十余里、宽六七里的通路。
    当两个突击团团长报告，前面已无大股敌人时，我们才松了一口气：打开通路了！我们一面向刘邓首长报告，一面又重新调整了部署：令五十二团五十三团在通路两侧展开，要像坚固的堤坝一样，坚决抗住两边敌人的反扑，保住通路的安全，同时把五十四团第一营调上去，变后卫为前卫，扫荡前进。我亲自代替了营长指挥，团长下到连，营长下到班。这个营是战斗力很强的一营，有七百多人，全部武器装备都是在鲁西南战役缴获的新武器。战士们情绪高昂，一律上起刺刀。
    “遇上敌人怎么办？”我在队列里走着问大家。耳边立刻响起一片回声：
    “拼刺刀！”
    “有多少消灭它多少！”
    “……”
    火红的太阳，跃出了地平线，照耀着我们前进的道路。尽管两侧的敌人拼命反击，但一次又一次地被我两侧两个团打下去，最后敌人出动了飞机配合地面炮火，向我军通路轰炸，扫射，然而，这一切都无济于事，丝毫也不能阻挡我们前进。大军像破堤的洪水向西南方奔流。
    “两军相逢勇者胜”，我军胜利了。敌人消灭我军于汝河两岸的梦想彻底破产了。
    第二天下午二时左右，我们胜利地到达了预定的集结地彭店。部队休息了几个小时，吃得饱饱的，意气风发精神百倍。黄昏时分，我们又肩负起新的使命，向息县，向淮河渡口进发了。
