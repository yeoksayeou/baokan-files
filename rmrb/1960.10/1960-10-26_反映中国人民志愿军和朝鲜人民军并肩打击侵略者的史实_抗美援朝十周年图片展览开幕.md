Xinhua News Agency, October 25th. A photo exhibition commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's departure to Korea to resist US aggression opened in Beijing today. It is jointly organized by the Sino-Korean Friendship Association and the China Photographic Society.

Among those who visited the exhibition today were Wei Chuantong, Vice President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, Zhang Yinquan, Vice Chairman of the China Photographic Society, Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture, Luo Jun, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, former Volunteer Army heroes Hu Xiudao, Guo Enzhi, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

Li Yonghao, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, embassy personnel, and diplomatic envoys and officials from various socialist countries stationed in China were invited to visit the exhibition.

At ten o'clock in the morning, visitors arrived at the exhibition hall.

On display were 150 photographs covering the entire period of the great War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, from the US imperialists planning the war of aggression against Korea, to their being beaten into submission by the Chinese and Korean people and signing the armistice agreement, to the triumphant return of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Among them were a large number of pictures exposing the US imperialists' launching of the war of aggression against Korea, armed occupation of our territory Taiwan, extending the flames of war to the Yalu River, bombing our territory, and killing our compatriots; vivid scenes recording the Chinese people's surging movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, sending their outstanding sons and daughters – the Chinese People's Volunteer Army – across the Yalu River to fight side by side with the Korean People's Army against the aggressors and achieving great victories; and moving pictures reflecting the Korean people's love and support for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as if they were their own children, as well as the close and seamless cooperation and joint combat of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies. People lingered for a long time and were extremely moved in front of the pictures recording the Volunteer Army's brave fighting in the early days of their deployment, enduring ice and snow, in front of the pictures recording the heroic defense of the tunnels by the heroes of Shangganling, and in front of the heroic images of martyrs such as Huang Jiguang, Luo Shengjiao, and the Korean internationalist fighter Park Jae-geun. Photos of the American invading army being beaten by the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, losing their helmets and armor, fleeing in panic, and American soldiers raising their hands to surrender became the object of people's laughter.

After the visit, Wei Chuantong, Vice President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, told reporters: This is a very good classroom. It vividly tells us that US imperialism is not only the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people, but also the most ferocious enemy of the people all over the world. It appears to be powerful, but it is actually a paper tiger that is strong in appearance but weak in reality. The victory of the Korean War was achieved by the Chinese and Korean people, with the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people from all countries in the world, uniting as one and resolutely fighting. Zhang Yinquan, Vice Chairman of the China Photographic Society, told reporters: This exhibition not only powerfully exposed the US imperialists' crimes of aggression and the truth about the paper tiger, but also very profoundly reflected the heroic and unyielding spirit of the Chinese and Korean people in fighting against the common enemy, giving us a profound education. The former Volunteer Army heroes, while visiting the exhibition, introduced the fighting deeds of the Volunteer Army to the audience with excitement, exposed the truth about the US imperialist paper tiger with their personal experiences, and explained the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. Hu Xiudao, Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, first-class hero of the Volunteer Army, and special-class meritorious person, said: We received the care and support of the Korean people at all times in Korea. During the Shangganling Campaign, Korean men, women, and children rushed to the front line together to transport the wounded, ammunition, cook meals, and do laundry for us. The campaign lasted for forty-three days, and they did not sleep well for forty-three days and nights. We will never forget the enthusiastic support of the Korean people. Our deep friendship with the Korean people will last forever.

    反映中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩打击侵略者的史实
    抗美援朝十周年图片展览开幕
    新华社25日讯　中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战十周年图片展览，今天在北京开幕。这是中国朝鲜友好协会和中国摄影学会为纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战十周年联合举办的。
  今天参观展览的有中朝友好协会副会长魏传统，中国摄影学会副主席张印泉，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，文化部副部长夏衍，对外文化联络委员会副主任罗俊，前志愿军英雄胡修道、郭恩志等和首都各界人士。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使李永镐和使馆人员，各社会主义国家驻华使节和外交官员，应邀参观了展览。
    上午十时，参观的人们来到展览厅。
    这里展览着从美帝国主义策划侵朝战争，到它被朝中人民打得低下头来签订停战协定，到中国人民志愿军凯旋归国，整个伟大抗美援朝时期的图片一百五十幅。其中，有揭露美帝国主义发动侵朝战争，武装霸占我国领土台湾，把战火烧到鸭绿江边，轰炸我领土，杀害我同胞等种种罪行的大批图片；有记载我国人民掀起轰轰烈烈抗美援朝运动，派遣自己优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军跨过鸭绿江同朝鲜人民军并肩打击侵略者，取得伟大胜利的生动场面；有反映朝鲜人民像对待子女一样热爱和支援中国人民志愿军，以及朝中人民军队亲密无间、并肩作战的动人画面。人们在记载志愿军出国初期餐冰饮雪，奋勇作战的图片面前，在记载上甘岭英雄坚守坑道英勇杀敌的图片面前，在英雄黄继光、罗盛教和朝鲜国际主义战士朴在根等烈士的英姿面前，都是久久停留，异常激动。美国侵略军被朝中人民军队打得丢盔弃甲、狼狈逃窜和美国兵高举双手缴枪求饶的照片，则成了人们的笑料。
    中朝友好协会副会长魏传统在参观后对记者说：这是一个很好的课堂，它生动地告诉我们美帝国主义不仅是中朝两国人民的共同敌人，而且是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。它貌似强大，实际上是一个外强中干的纸老虎。朝鲜战争的胜利是朝中两国人民在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和世界各国爱好和平人民的支持下，团结一致，坚决斗争所取得的。中国摄影学会副主席张印泉告诉记者：这个展览不仅有力地揭露了美帝国主义的侵略罪行和纸老虎的真相，而且非常深刻地反映了朝中两国人民在反对共同敌人的斗争中英勇不屈、坚决斗争的英雄气概，使我们受到了深刻的教育。前志愿军英雄们一面参观，一面怀着激动的心情向观众介绍志愿军的斗争事迹，用亲身经历揭露美帝国主义纸老虎真相，和说明中朝人民的深厚友谊。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄、志愿军一级英雄、特等功臣胡修道说：我们在朝鲜无时无刻不受到朝鲜人民的关怀和支援，在上甘岭战役中，朝鲜的男女老少一齐奔上火线，为我们运伤员，运弹药，做饭洗衣，战役进行了四十三天，他们也四十三个昼夜没有好好睡觉。朝鲜人民的热情支援，是我们永远不会忘记的。我们和朝鲜人民的深厚友谊将万古常青。
