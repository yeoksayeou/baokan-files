Rapid progress in new cotton purchasing in various regions.

    Shandong
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 24th: All cotton-producing areas in Shandong Province have strengthened leadership, made overall arrangements for labor, and launched a mass upsurge in cotton picking and selling while doing a good job in wheat planting.
    Party committees at all levels in Shandong Province have strengthened their leadership over cotton picking and sales. On October 4, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee held a telephone conference, requiring all localities to step up the procurement of agricultural products so that the ripe cotton could be picked and sold in time without loss. The Provincial Department of Commerce formed four working groups, which went to Liaocheng, Zibo, Changwei, and Heze in early October to inspect and assist in cotton purchasing. Party committees at all levels in cotton-producing areas have concentrated their main efforts on strengthening the leadership of new cotton picking and purchasing, reasonably arranged labor, and fully mobilized semi-labor, auxiliary labor, and rural students to participate, based on the current situation of universal cotton maturity. Many communes and teams immediately shifted their main efforts to cotton picking and selling after basically completing the task of wheat sowing.
    Xinjiang
    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 24th: Cotton-producing areas in northern and southern Xinjiang have generally entered the peak season for cotton picking. People's communes and farms have organized a large number of manpower and transportation tools to launch a cotton picking and selling campaign.
    Before the start of cotton picking, all localities unified the arrangement of manpower and animal power to ensure that this work could be completed on time during the busy season of autumn planting and autumn harvesting. After proper arrangements were made in Kashgar Prefecture, a certain amount of manpower was regularly assigned to cotton picking and selling. By October 20, the prefecture had purchased more than 3.4 million catties of new cotton.
    While speeding up collection, transportation, and sales, all localities paid special attention to ensuring the quality of cotton picking, requiring separate picking, drying, transporting, and selling, so as to sell more high-quality cotton to the state.
    Hubei
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 24th: People's communes in the cotton-producing areas of Hubei Province are organizing commune members to pick and sell new cotton to support national construction.
    Communes and production teams in all cotton-producing areas have carefully arranged labor and generally organized specialized teams for picking, sorting, drying, and sending for sale, adopting a method that combines regular and concentrated efforts, and professional and mass movements, to vigorously pick cotton and deliver it to the warehouse. Xinzhou County organized more than 5,800 specialized groups, led by party secretaries at all levels, to ensure timely picking, timely sorting and drying, and timely delivery for sale. Many students and cadres from government offices also participated in the picking. As of October 5, the county had delivered 12.86 million catties, accounting for 64% of the amount picked, an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
    Jiangxi
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 24th: People in cotton-producing areas in Jiangxi are seizing the peak period of boll opening and fluffing in the middle stage, and are launching a new upsurge in cotton picking and selling.
    In order to ensure that all cotton is harvested well, party committees at all levels have further strengthened their leadership and used the method of carrying out mass movements in a big way to launch a new upsurge in rushing to harvest. Party secretaries at all levels in Jinxian County went deep into communes and teams, grasped weak links in advanced areas, and waved red flags in backward areas, mobilizing the masses to carry out a "learn, compare, surpass, and help" picking competition, which caused the county's cotton picking volume to increase sharply from more than 200,000 catties per day to more than 1 million catties.
    Liaoning
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th: A new cotton picking and purchasing campaign, in which the whole party takes action, makes comprehensive arrangements, and closely links picking, sorting, drying, and purchasing, is being enthusiastically launched throughout Liaoning Province.
    Party committees at all levels in Liaoning Province attach great importance to this year's cotton purchasing work. Leading cadres at all levels are in charge, and party secretaries and members in many areas go deep into the front line of production to direct picking and purchasing. Under the unified leadership of the party committees, commercial departments in various localities have transferred a large number of cadres to go deep into the countryside to help production teams arrange labor and organize picking, while at the same time carrying out crash purchases of cotton. After the commercial departments in Jinzhou area dispatched more than 600 cadres to go deep into communes and teams, the amount of cotton purchased from October 10 to 15 increased by 64% compared with the previous five days.

    山东
    据新华社济南24日电　山东省各产棉区加强领导，统筹安排劳力，在种好小麦的同时，掀起群众性的摘棉、售棉新高潮。
    山东省各级党委层层加强对棉花采摘、交售工作的领导。10月4日，中共山东省委召开电话会议，要求各地对农产品收购工作加紧进行，使已成熟的棉花及时采摘交售，不受损失。省商业厅组成四个工作组，于月初分赴聊城、淄博、昌潍、菏泽四个地区检查和帮助进行棉花收购工作。棉区各级党委根据当前棉花普遍成熟的情况，都集中主要力量加强新棉采摘、收购工作的领导，合理安排了劳力，充分发动半劳力、辅助劳力和农村学生参加。很多社、队在基本完成小麦播种任务以后，都立即把主要力量转移到棉花摘售方面来。

    据新华社乌鲁木齐24日电　新疆天山南北棉区已普遍进入摘棉高潮季节。各人民公社和农场都组织了大批人力和运输工具，展开了摘棉售棉运动。
    在开始摘棉以前，各地统一安排了人力畜力，保证在秋种、秋收大忙季节，也能按时完成这一工作。喀什专区经过妥善安排后，经常有一定数量的人力担任摘棉售棉工作，到10月20日，全专区已收购新棉三百四十多万斤。
    各地在快收、快运、快售的同时，特别注意保证摘棉质量，要求作到分摘、分晒、分运、分售，以更多的优质棉卖给国家。

    为了保证棉花全部收好，各级党委都进一步加强领导，运用大搞群众运动的办法，掀起新的抢收高潮。进贤县各级党委书记深入社、队，在先进地区抓薄弱环节，在后进地区大扬红旗，发动群众开展“学、比、超、帮”的采收竞赛，促使全县棉花采收量由每天二十多万斤猛增到一百多万斤。
    辽宁
    据新华社沈阳24日电　一个全党动手、全面安排，采摘、整晒、收购环环扣紧的新棉采摘、收购运动，在辽宁全省各地热烈展开。
    辽宁省各级党委对今年的棉花收购工作十分重视，层层由领导干部挂帅，许多地区的党委书记和委员深入生产第一线指挥采摘和收购。各地商业部门在党委统一领导下，抽调了大批干部深入农村，一面帮助生产队安排劳力，组织采摘，一面突击收购棉花。锦州地区商业部门抽出六百多名干部深入社、队后，10月10日到15日的棉花收购量，就比前五天增加64％。
