    Deeply Grasp the Small Group: "Help" Must Come First

    To help small groups do their work well, we must firmly implement the Party's mass line. After leaders at all levels go deep into the small groups, they must rely heavily on the group leaders and other key members to help them improve their working abilities and, through them, motivate all group members to run the small group well. Group leaders and other key members are the core force of the entire small group. They have close ties with the masses and know the situation of the small group best. Whether the work of the small group is done well or not should mainly rely on the internal strength of the small group. If the working level of group leaders and other key members is not improved, and we only rely on cadres who go down to do the work, even if some results are achieved temporarily, once the cadres leave, many tasks are prone to a "relapse" phenomenon.

    The content of small group work is very rich, encompassing everything from production to life, from ideological education to various studies; the problems encountered in small group work are all specific problems raised by the masses from practice, which require specific analysis and specific solutions. Therefore, it is not an easy task for cadres at all levels to help small groups do their work well. The most important thing here is to humbly and earnestly learn from the key members and the broad masses of the small group. Cadres at all levels who go down to the small groups have many strengths, such as a relatively high level of policy thinking, richer work experience, and a more comprehensive understanding of the situation, etc. However, in general, their understanding of the specific situation of the small group is not deep enough, their production knowledge is relatively lacking, and many people do not have the experience of running a small group well; and all of this is precisely the conditions necessary for running a small group well. We must recognize that the knowledge and experience of the masses are the richest and most practical, and the creative ability of the masses is the greatest. There is much to learn from going deep into the small groups. Therefore, to deeply grasp the small group, we must appear as an ordinary worker, make close friends with the masses, and learn humbly from everyone about production knowledge and the experience of running a small group well with the humble attitude of being a primary school student. Only in this way can we first be good students and then be good teachers, first learn well, and then help well.

    The most important method to help group leaders improve their working ability and help small groups do their work well is for cadres to "set up camp" and "settle down" on the front line of production, conduct thorough investigation and research through "three togethers" and "four samenesses", pay attention to discovering problems at any time, and study solutions with group leaders and other key members of the small group to help the small group solve problems. This method of cultivating and improving their working ability from actual work is the most practical, the most effective, and the easiest to be accepted by everyone. Of course, in order to comprehensively and systematically cultivate and improve group leaders and other key members, we can also take the method of holding short-term training classes to train group leaders in rotation, systematically explain the basic working methods of group leaders; we can also take the method of "one lesson per incident", in conjunction with the central work or the implementation of a policy, organize special studies to help group leaders clarify a certain task and relevant policies and working methods.

### 深入抓小组“帮”字要当先

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    深入抓小组“帮”字要当先
    要想帮助小组搞好工作，必须坚定地贯彻党的群众路线。各级领导干部深入到小组以后，要很好地依靠小组长等骨干力量，帮助他们提高工作能力，通过他们带动全体组员，把小组办好。小组长等骨干，是全小组的核心力量，他们同群众有密切的联系，最了解小组的情况，小组工作搞好搞不好，主要应该依靠小组内部的力量。如果不把小组长等骨干的工作水平提高一步，单纯依靠下去的干部做工作，即使一时收到某些成效，一旦干部离开以后，很多工作容易产生“回生”现象。
    小组工作内容十分丰富，从生产到生活，从思想教育到各种学习，可以说是无所不包；小组工作中遇到的问题，都是群众从实践中提出的具体问题，需要具体分析、具体解决。所以，各级干部要帮助小组做好工作，并不是轻而易举的事情。这里面，最重要的一条是虚心地、认真地向小组的骨干及广大群众学习。下到小组去的各级干部有许多长处，比如政策思想水平比较高，工作经验比较丰富，了解情况比较全面，等等。但是，一般说来，他们了解小组具体情况是不够深的，生产知识较为缺乏，许多人也没有办好小组的经验；而这一切又恰恰是搞好一个小组所必需具备的条件。要认识到，群众的知识，群众的经验，是最丰富最实际的，群众的创造能力，是最伟大的，深入到小组中去是大有可学的。因此，深入抓小组，一定要以一个普通劳动者的身份出现，和群众交知心朋友，以甘当小学生的谦逊态度，向大家虚心学习生产知识和办好小组的经验。只有这样，先当好学生，然后再做先生，先学好，然后才能帮好。
    帮助小组长提高工作能力，帮助小组搞好工作，最主要的方法是干部深入生产第一线“扎营”、“落户”，通过“三边”、“四同”，认真进行调查研究工作，随时注意发现问题，同小组长等小组骨干一道研究解决办法，帮助小组解决问题。这种从实际工作中培养提高他们的工作能力的作法，最切合实际，最有效，也最易于为大家所接受。当然，为了全面地有系统地培养提高小组长等骨干，还可以采取举办短期训练班的办法，轮流培养小组长，有系统地讲解小组长的基本工作方法；也可以采取“一事一训”的办法，配合中心工作或者一项方针政策的贯彻，组织专题学习，帮助小组长明确某一项任务和有关的方针、政策和工作方法。
