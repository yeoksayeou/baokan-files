Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, September 30th: People from all walks of life in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, held a grand gathering at the State Theatre tonight to warmly celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Mongolian party and government leaders Tsedenbal, Molomjamts, Baljinnayam, Dugersuren, Maydar, Lhamsuren, and heads of party and government departments and mass organizations attended the celebration.

The delegation of the Sino-Mongolian Friendship Association headed by Cao Diqiu and Ji Yatai, Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia Xie Fusheng and embassy staff, and Chinese experts in Mongolia were invited to attend the meeting. Diplomatic envoys from various countries to Mongolia also attended the meeting.

The celebration was presided over by Bata, the Mayor of Ulaanbaatar. Luvsanravdant, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary party, First Secretary of the Ulaanbaatar Municipal Committee, and Ambassador Xie Fusheng spoke at the meeting.

Luvsanravdant said that the Mongolian people, together with the great Chinese people, the people of the socialist camp, and progressive people all over the world, are celebrating this historically significant festival of China with incomparable joy and excitement.

He said that the Chinese revolution is a direct continuation of the Great October Socialist Revolution and is the most significant revolutionary event in human history since the October Revolution. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution has severely hit the imperialist and colonialist system, weakened the strength of the imperialist system, further deepened its internal crisis, changed the balance of power between the capitalist and socialist systems in favor of socialism, and further strengthened the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism.

He then spoke in detail about the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party during the period of national economic recovery, the first five-year plan, and the first two years of the second five-year plan. He said that the great achievements made by the great Chinese people in the past eleven years have strengthened the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and are an important force that has a great impact on maintaining peace and security in Asia and the world.

He said that U.S. imperialism is actively pursuing a blatant policy of aggression against China, continuing to interfere in China's internal affairs and carrying out a series of shameless activities. These have aroused the anger of progressive mankind. We are convinced that the heroic struggle of the Chinese people will surely completely crush the aggressive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the stubborn policy of its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The great Chinese people will surely liberate Taiwan, an inalienable territory of the motherland.

Talking about the friendly relations between Mongolia and China, he said that Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China visited Mongolia in May this year at the invitation of the Mongolian government and signed the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance and agreements between the two countries, which is a new step in further developing the unbreakable fraternal friendship and cooperation between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples. The Communist Party of China, the government of the People's Republic of China, and the friendly Chinese people have repeatedly provided material and labor assistance to our socialist construction cause, which has made important contributions to accelerating our country's development and prosperity. He also mentioned that the Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Month activities held throughout Mongolia have made new contributions to the brotherly cooperation between the peoples of Mongolia and China.

He then extended his heartfelt and warm congratulations to all members of the delegation of the Sino-Mongolian Friendship Association headed by Cao Diqiu, and through the delegation to the Sino-Mongolian Friendship Association and all the Chinese people.

He also talked about the international situation in his speech.

Ambassador Xie Fusheng expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Mongolian people for warmly celebrating the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and holding the "Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Month" activities. He said that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, holding high the three red banners of the general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, have achieved great victories in the cause of building socialism at high speed. After listing the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people in the economic, cultural, and other fields, he said that these great victories were achieved under the brilliant illumination of the general line.

Xie Fusheng said that China and Mongolia are close brotherly neighbors, and there is a long tradition of friendship between the two peoples.

Xie Fusheng then talked about Mongolia's socialist construction achievements and the prospects for the third five-year plan. He said that the Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the achievements that the Mongolian people have already made and their future plans. We deeply know that the achievements of any fraternal country in socialist construction will promote the common upsurge of the economies of the socialist camp countries and enhance the strength of the entire socialist camp.

The ambassador said that our country pursues a peaceful foreign policy, advocates peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems, and has always struggled against the aggression of imperialism headed by the United States and for the defense of world peace. Talking about the recent international situation, he pointed out that recently, U.S. imperialism is deliberately plotting subversion and intervention against the people of Cuba and Laos, and is invading the Congo and carrying out intervention under the banner of the United Nations. Facts show that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world. The Chinese people always oppose the war policy and aggression policy of U.S. imperialism and resolutely support the national democratic movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

He said that our people will, on the existing basis, further strengthen the unity, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation with the fraternal Mongolian people, strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and make greater contributions to the cause of defending world peace and human progress.

After the meeting, a literary and artistic performance was held.

    蒙古党政领导人泽登巴尔，莫洛姆扎木茨，巴尔吉尼雅姆，杜格苏伦，迈达尔，拉姆苏伦和党政各部门、群众团体的负责人出席了庆祝大会。
    以曹荻秋、吉雅泰为首的中蒙友好协会代表团，中国驻蒙古大使谢甫生和使馆人员，以及在蒙古的中国专家等应邀出席了大会。出席大会的还有各国驻蒙古的外交使节。
    庆祝大会由乌兰巴托市市长巴塔主持。蒙古人民革命党中央政治局候补委员、乌兰巴托市委第一书记卢布桑拉布丹和谢甫生大使先后在会上讲了话。
    卢布桑拉布丹说，蒙古人民同伟大中国人民、社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界进步人类一起，以无比欢欣鼓舞的心情庆祝中国这个具有历史意义的节日。
    他说，中国革命是伟大十月社会主义革命的直接继续，是十月革命以来在人类历史上发生的最巨大的革命事件。中国人民革命的胜利，沉重地打击了帝国主义、殖民主义体系，削弱了帝国主义体系的力量，进一步加深了它的内部危机，使资本主义和社会主义两个体系的力量对比发生了有利于社会主义的变化，进一步增强了和平民主和社会主义的力量。
    他接着详细地谈到了中国人民在中国共产党领导下在国民经济恢复时期、第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划前两年所取得的巨大成就。他说，伟大的中国人民在十一年中取得的美好成就，增强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营力量，是对维护亚洲和世界和平与安全产生极大影响的一支重要力量。
    他说，美帝国主义积极奉行明目张胆的侵略中国的政策，继续干涉中国内政和进行一系列的无耻活动。这些都引起了进步人类的愤怒。我们确信，中国人民的英勇斗争一定能够彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋和它的走狗蒋介石集团的顽固政策。伟大中国人民一定能够解放祖国不可分割的领土台湾。
    在谈到蒙中两国友好关系时，他说，中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来应蒙古政府的邀请今年5月来蒙古访问，签订了两国友好互助条约和协定，这是进一步发展蒙中人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊和合作的一个新步骤。中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和友好的中国人民对我国社会主义建设事业一次又一次地提供了物资和劳动力的援助，这对加速我国的发展和繁荣作出了重要贡献。他还谈到在蒙古全国各地举办的蒙中友好旬活动对蒙中两国人民的兄弟般的合作作出了新的贡献。
    他接着向以曹荻秋为首的中蒙友好协会代表团全体团员，并通过代表团向中蒙友好协会及全体中国人民致衷心的热烈祝贺。
    他在讲话中还谈到了国际形势。
    谢甫生大使在讲话时对蒙古人民热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立十一周年和举行“蒙中友好旬”活动，表示衷心的感谢。他说，中国人民在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛泽东主席的领导下高举社会主义建设的总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗，在高速度建设社会主义的事业中取得了巨大胜利。他在列举了中国人民在经济、文化等各个方面取得的光辉成就以后说，这些巨大胜利都是在总路线的光辉照耀下取得的。
    谢甫生说，中蒙两国是亲密的兄弟邻邦，两国人民间有着悠久的传统友谊。
    谢甫生接着谈到蒙古的社会主义建设成就和第三个五年计划的前景。他说，中国人民对于蒙古人民已经取得的成就和今后的计划，感到欢欣鼓舞。我们深知任何一个兄弟国家在社会主义建设中取得的成就都会促进社会主义阵营各国经济的共同高涨，增强整个社会主义阵营的力量。
    大使说，我国奉行和平的外交政策，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，一直为反对以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略和保卫世界和平而斗争。他在谈到最近的国际形势时指出，最近美帝国主义正处心积虑地对古巴和老挝人民策划颠覆和干涉阴谋，并打着联合国旗帜侵略刚果和进行干涉。事实说明，美帝国主义是世界一切爱好和平国家和人民的共同敌人。中国人民始终反对美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，坚决支持亚非和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族民主运动。
    他说，我国人民必将在现有的基础上进一步加强同兄弟蒙古人民的团结友好、互助合作，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结、为保卫世界和平和人类进步事业作出更大贡献。
    会后举行了文艺演出。
