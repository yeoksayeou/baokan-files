Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, October 29th: The Albanian Telegraph Agency reported on the 28th that the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly awarded medals to the crew of the steamship "Ali Kelmendi" to reward them for resolutely defending the party line and the glory of the Albanian people, regardless of the threats of the Yugoslav revisionists.

These crew members were attacked by a storm on the high seas on the 17th and were forced to enter the Yugoslav port of Gruž for shelter. The Yugoslav authorities insisted that they remove an article exposing Yugoslav modern revisionism from the steamship's wall poster, but this provocative demand was rejected by them. The Yugoslav authorities, in violation of international maritime law, refused to allow the steamship to take shelter from the storm. The crew resolutely left the port and sailed into the high seas.

Based on the government's recommendation, the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly awarded these crew members the Third Class Order of Freedom. Captain Frantz Ivanai and Deputy Secretary of the Labor Party Organization Ramazan Domi received the Medal for Bravery, and other crew members received the Medal for Courage.

    坚定不移保卫党的路线　临危不惧击败南修正主义者的挑衅
    阿尔巴尼亚卡尔门迪号船员荣获勋章
    据新华社地拉那29日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社28日报道，阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团授予“阿里·卡尔门迪号”汽船的船员以勋章，奖励他们不顾南斯拉夫修正主义者的威胁，坚决保卫党的路线和阿尔巴尼亚人民的光荣。
    这些船员17日在公海上航行时受到了暴风雨的袭击，曾被迫开进南斯拉夫的格鲁日港口避风。南斯拉夫当局硬要他们拿掉汽船墙报上的一篇揭露南斯拉夫现代修正主义的文章，但是这种挑衅的要求遭到了他们的拒绝，南斯拉夫当局竟违反国际航海公法，拒绝让这艘汽船避风，船员们毅然离港驶向公海。
    根据政府的建议，阿尔巴尼亚人民议院主席团授给这些船员三级自由勋章。船长弗兰茨·伊瓦奈和劳动党组织副书记拉马赞·多米获得勇敢勋章，其它船员获得勇敢奖章。
