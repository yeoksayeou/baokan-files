    Congratulations on the Birth of the Federation of Nigeria
    Today, as the Chinese people warmly celebrate the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we are pleased to see that Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, has declared its independence. The Nigerian people, who have endured a full century of brutal rule under British colonialists, have finally broken free from the shackles of colonialism and achieved their current independent status through their own heroic and unyielding struggle. The Chinese people express their heartfelt congratulations to the Nigerian people for their victory in the struggle against colonial rule and for national independence. Premier Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country have sent telegrams to the national leaders of Nigeria, announcing the decision of the People's Republic of China to recognize the Federation of Nigeria and wishing the Nigerian people further achievements in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism and in adhering to the path of independent national development.
    The independence of Nigeria is undoubtedly a heavy blow to British colonial rule in Africa and a great encouragement to the African people's struggle for independence. As everyone knows, Nigeria is Britain's largest colony in Africa, with a population exceeding the total population of all British colonies in Africa combined. Nigeria's products are incredibly rich, with palm oil production ranking first in the capitalist world, and columbite and tin production also ranking first in the capitalist world. For a hundred years, British colonialists have regarded it as a "warehouse" for supplying strategic materials and agricultural raw materials, from which they have extracted countless profits. Therefore, the jubilant cheers of the Nigerian people celebrating independence sing the elegy of British colonialism. All African people still under colonial enslavement, especially the people of British colonies, will draw new inspiration from the victory of the Nigerian people and strengthen their struggle against colonial rule and for national independence.
    In order to conceal their colonialist face and continue to deceive the African people, British colonialists even say that Britain is "consciously and voluntarily transferring power" in Nigeria, and they boast that Britain has opened a "new era of colonial policy" in British West Africa. The apologists for colonialism are trying to prove that without the "benevolence" of the colonial masters, the colonial people could not possibly gain independence. But how can these beautiful lies rewrite the historical facts of blood and tears! During the hundred years of British rule in Nigeria, British colonialists not only never relaxed their armed suppression of the Nigerian people, but also viciously planned the conspiracy of "divide and rule," doing everything possible to maintain its colonial rule in Nigeria. The heroic Nigerian people, in order to break the chains of colonialism, have never ceased their struggle for independence and freedom. In particular, the Nigerian working class has repeatedly launched strike movements. In the fifteen months from 1949 to 1950, Nigerian workers held forty-six consecutive strikes to protest the colonialists' "constitution," with 50,000 participants. Between 1952 and 1953, the Enugu miners held several strikes, and there was also a soldiers' uprising in Lagos, the capital of Nigeria. Faced with the surging national independence movement, British colonialists were forced to carry out several "constitutional reforms" after the war and made some superficial concessions, but they have always hindered the Nigerian people from achieving independence. This could not but arouse more resolute resistance from the Nigerian people. In September 1958, the delegation of the Federal Government of Nigeria attending the London Conference made it clear that if Britain refused to resolve the issue peacefully, the Nigerian people would have to take all possible means, even resorting to force, to fight for the realization of national independence. It was precisely under the circumstances of the vigorous and unstoppable rise of the Nigerian national independence movement that British colonialists had no choice but to agree to her gaining independent status on October 1, 1960. From this, the Nigerian people can certainly understand that not only did the British colonialists not "consciously and voluntarily transfer power" in the past, but even after Nigeria gained independence, they would never "consciously and voluntarily" allow Nigeria's independent development.
    The Nigerian people still have the serious tasks of opposing imperialism and colonialism and continuing to develop national independence and build their own country.
    China and Nigeria are both ancient civilized countries with a long history. We have both suffered from imperialist and colonialist aggression and plunder, and we both have a fine tradition of fighting against imperialism. Although our two countries are thousands of miles apart, the common struggle against imperialism closely links the people of our two countries. We are pleased to see that in recent years, Nigerian friends have continuously come to China for friendly visits, bringing with them the deep friendship of the Nigerian people. We hope and believe that with the independence of the Federation of Nigeria, the friendship between the people of our two countries will be greatly enhanced, and the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries will be further developed.

### 祝贺尼日利亚联邦的诞生

    祝贺尼日利亚联邦的诞生
    今天，正当中国人民热烈庆祝十一周年国庆节的时候，我们高兴地看到，非洲一个人口最多的国家——尼日利亚宣告独立了。在英国殖民者残酷统治下度过了整整一百年的尼日利亚人民，通过自己英勇不屈的斗争，终于挣脱了殖民主义的镣铐，取得了今天的独立地位。中国人民对尼日利亚人民在反对殖民统治和争取民族独立斗争中所获得的胜利，表示衷心的祝贺。我国周恩来总理和陈毅外交部长已经致电尼日利亚国家领导人，宣布中华人民共和国决定承认尼日利亚联邦，并祝尼日利亚人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义、坚持民族独立发展道路的斗争中取得进一步的成就。
    尼日利亚的独立，对英国在非洲的殖民统治无疑是一个沉重的打击，而对非洲人民争取独立的斗争则是个很大的鼓舞。大家知道，尼日利亚是英国在非洲的最大的殖民地，这个国家的人口超过英国在非洲的全部殖民地人口的总和。尼日利亚的物产无比富饶，棕榈油的产量占资本主义世界的第一位，钶铁矿和鈛的产量在资本主义世界也居首位。一百年来，英国殖民者一直把它当作供应战略物资和农业原料的“仓库”，从那里攫取了难以计数的利润。因此，尼日利亚人民庆祝独立的欢声，唱出了英国殖民主义者的挽歌，一切尚处在殖民奴役下的非洲人民，特别是英属殖民地人民，将从尼日利亚人民的胜利中，得到新的鼓舞，加强他们反对殖民统治和争取民族独立的斗争。
    英国殖民者为了掩饰自己殖民主义者的面目，继续欺骗非洲人民，竟说什么英国在尼日利亚是“自觉自愿地移交权力”的，还吹嘘英国在英属西非开辟了“殖民政策的新纪元”。殖民主义的卫道者们力图证明，没有殖民老爷们的“恩赐”，殖民地人民是不可能获得独立的。但是，这些动听的谎言，怎么能够改写血泪的史实呢！在英国统治尼日利亚的一百年间，英国殖民者不仅没有放松过对尼日利亚人民的武装镇压，而且还恶毒地策划“分而治之”的阴谋，千方百计地维护它在尼日利亚的殖民统治。而英勇的尼日利亚人民为了打碎殖民主义的锁链，也从来没有停止过争取独立和自由的斗争，特别是尼日利亚的工人阶级，一次又一次地掀起罢工运动。从1949年到1950年的十五个月内，尼日利亚工人连续举行了四十六次罢工，抗议殖民者的“宪法”，参加者达五万人。1952到1953年间，恩努古矿工举行了好几次罢工，在尼日利亚首都拉各斯还发生了士兵的起义。面对着汹涌澎湃的民族独立运动，英国殖民者在战后被迫进行了几次“宪法改革”，也作出了一些表面上的让步，但却一直阻挠尼日利亚人民取得独立。这就不能不激起尼日利亚人民更加坚决的反抗。1958年9月，尼日利亚联邦政府参加伦敦会议的代表团就明确表示，如果英国拒绝和平解决问题，尼日利亚人民就不得不采取一切可能的手段，直至采用武力，为实现民族独立而斗争。正是在尼日利亚民族独立运动风起云涌、势不可当的形势下，英国殖民者才不得不同意她在1960年10月1日获得独立地位。由此，尼日利亚人民当然能够懂得，不仅过去英国殖民者并不是“自觉自愿地移交权力”，而且就是在尼日利亚取得独立以后，也决不会从此“自觉自愿地”允许尼日利亚的独立发展。
    尼日利亚人民仍然有着反对帝国主义、殖民主义和继续发展民族独立、建设自己国家的严重任务。
    中国和尼日利亚都是有着悠久历史的文明古国。我们共同遭受过帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略和掠夺，共同具有反对帝国主义斗争的优良传统。尽管我们两国相距万里，但是反对帝国主义的共同斗争把我们两国人民紧密地联结在一起。我们高兴地看到，最近几年来不断有尼日利亚的朋友来到中国进行友好访问，并且带来了尼日利亚人民深厚的情谊。我们希望并且相信，随着尼日利亚联邦的独立，我们两国人民间的友谊将大大增强，我们两国间的友好合作关系也将得到进一步的发展。
