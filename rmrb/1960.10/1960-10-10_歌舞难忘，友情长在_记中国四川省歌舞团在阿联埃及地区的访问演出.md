Unforgettable Songs and Dances, Everlasting Friendship
    ——A Record of the Visit and Performance of the Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe of China in the Egyptian Region of the United Arab Republic

The Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe of China concluded its visit and performance in the Egyptian region of the United Arab Republic, laden with the praise and friendship of the Egyptian people. Starting from September 3, the song and dance troupe conducted more than half a month of visits and performances in Cairo, Ismailia, and Alexandria.

	The Grand Occasion of the Performances

During the days when the song and dance troupe performed in Cairo, not only were the crowds surging like tides in front of the brightly lit "July 26" open-air theater, but the balconies of the residences next to the theater, and even the trees outside the theater, were crowded with people watching the performances. During the last two performances, due to the enthusiastic audience, the theater had to temporarily add two or three hundred seats. Many viewers brought their families, young and old, hoping to catch a glimpse of the artistic style of China. One worker, after watching a performance himself, hired a taxi the next day to bring his entire family of five from the suburbs eighteen kilometers away to see the performance of artists from China. For this worker with a meager income, it was indeed a considerable expense, but he did so without hesitation, and felt extremely happy and excited to be able to enable his entire family to see Chinese song and dance, especially his wife, a typical Arab woman with a black veil, who was entering a theater for the first time in her life. The worker repeatedly said, "Your songs and dances are really excellent, I want to see them again."

The performances in Ismailia and Alexandria were also unprecedentedly grand. Ismailia is a beautiful small city in the Suez Canal area with a population of only 40,000, yet more than 4,500 people watched the performance. The three floors of the Alexandria City Theater were also packed, and many viewers could not get seats and stood for more than two hours. During the performances for the armed forces of the United Arab Republic in these two cities, the soldiers all watched with great interest and often couldn't help but applaud while the programs were still in progress.

	Unforgettable Songs and Dances

No matter which city the performance was in, every program of the song and dance troupe was warmly welcomed by the audience. Dances such as the bright and lively "Flower Umbrella Dance," the light and graceful Yi ethnic dance "Presenting the Felt Cloak to Chairman Mao," the national-style "Lion Dance," and "People's Commune Celebrating a Bumper Harvest," which depicts a scene of rural joy, deeply attracted the audience and won continuous applause and cheers. One Egyptian female artist cheered for every program as if she were intoxicated. She said that every program was so enchanting, not only was the dance charming, but the Chinese music was truly deeply moving. People also praised the "Liangshan Folk Dance" for expressing the heroic character of the Chinese nation, and loved the "Spinning Girls" dance for expressing the joy of labor. The audience gave high praise to the cooperation of the Chinese orchestra and the coordinated and harmonious movements of the dancers. One audience member said it well, only the most collective nation can cooperate so well during a performance. In particular, it is difficult to describe the enthusiastic emotions expressed by the audience for the song "Great Mao Zedong." Every time the announcer reported the song, thunderous applause erupted from the audience. When the song and dance troupe were guests at a club in Ismailia, an officer who had heard the song repeatedly and earnestly requested the performers to sing it again for them on the spot. The instrumental ensemble of the song and dance troupe had to perform another piece for the audience every time amidst warm applause. They said that Chinese music expresses the high wisdom and culture of the Chinese people.

During these days, Egyptian newspapers, magazines, and pictorials published many articles and pictures introducing the performances of the Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe of China, giving the performances high praise and appreciation. "Al Gomhuria" said, "The extraordinary and wonderful performance brought us to a dreamlike realm." The weekly "My Country" said, "The performance of the Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe of China attracts the audience with true art. We should regard their performance as a good lesson on how to develop popular art and folk dance." An article in a pictorial said, "All the dances and songs of the Chinese song and dance troupe are full of joyful emotions and lofty and pure artistic conceptions. The performances of the Sichuan Song and Dance Troupe of China in the two regions of the United Arab Republic are a major event in the literary and artistic circles of the United Arab Republic. We can learn a lot from them. We should learn how to use songs and dances to express a joyful, optimistic, and positive emotion."

	Everlasting Friendship

Indeed, the performances of the Sichuan Song and Dance Troupe of China in the United Arab Republic not only expressed the infinitely joyful mood, hardworking and courageous character of the Chinese people, as well as their love for real life, their ideals for a better future, and their respect and love for the great leader Mao Zedong through songs and dances to the people of the United Arab Republic, but also conveyed the friendship of the Chinese people to the people of the United Arab Republic. On the other hand, from the enthusiastic praise of the audience and the extremely high evaluation of the newspapers, we also deeply felt the warm response of the friendship of the people of the United Arab Republic to the Chinese people. During the days when the song and dance troupe stayed in the Egyptian region, the actors, whether walking on the streets, on the beach, or visiting scenic spots, would always encounter kind smiles and friendly greetings. They would stop and shake hands warmly with you, and say a few words expressing their friendly feelings. They hoped that the actors would leave a signature and take a group photo... Once, after a performance, a little girl waited for an actor to sign her name for more than half an hour. Her father said to the actor, "Thank you very much for your performance. We will always be friends, even though our countries are so far apart." When the song and dance troupe finished its performance in Cairo, an old man who guarded the backstage of the "July 26" theater said to the actors: "You are really such good people! So kind and amiable, I really hate to see you leave." Another audience member specifically found the translator of the song and dance troupe after the performance, and said, "Thank you for bringing us such wonderful art. Not long ago, an American song and dance troupe also performed here, but your performance is many times better than theirs. Your songs and dances not only have beautiful forms, but also rich content."

The Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe of China has left the enthusiastic and friendly people of the United Arab Republic. They have left unforgettable songs and dances and the friendship of the Chinese people for their friends in the United Arab Republic. At the same time, they have also taken away infinitely beautiful memories and the everlasting friendship of the people of the United Arab Republic for the Chinese people.

    歌舞难忘，友情长在
    ——记中国四川省歌舞团在阿联埃及地区的访问演出
    新华社记者　林海
    中国四川省歌舞团满载着埃及人民的赞誉和友情，结束了在阿联埃及地区的访问演出。从9月3日起，歌舞团在开罗、伊斯美利亚和亚历山大城进行了半个多月的访问演出。
          演出的盛况
    歌舞团在开罗演出的那些日子，不仅在灯火辉煌的“7月26”露天剧院门前观众如潮水般涌来，就是在剧院旁边住宅的凉台上，甚至在剧院外面的大树上也挤满了观看演出的人群。在最后两场演出时由于观众的踊跃，剧院不得不临时增加了二、三百个座位。不少的观众扶老携幼带着全家，期望一睹中国艺术的风采。有一个工人，他自己看了一场后，第二天叫了一辆出租汽车把他的全家五口从十八公里以外的城郊带来看来自中国的艺术家的表演。对于这个收入微薄的工人来说，这的确是一笔相当大的支出，但他毫不犹豫地这样做了，而且由于能使他的全家都能看到中国歌舞而感到极大的快乐和兴奋，特别是他的妻子，这个带着黑面纱的典型的阿拉伯妇女，是有生以来第一次走进剧院。这个工人还一再地说，“你们的歌舞真是好极了，我还想再看一次”。
    在伊斯美利亚和亚历山大城的演出也是盛况空前。伊斯美利亚是苏伊士运河区的一个美丽的小城，它只有四万人口，然而观看了这次演出的就有四千五百多人。亚历山大城剧院的三层楼也都坐得满满的，还有许多观众得不到座位，就一直站着看了两个多小时。在这两个城市为阿联的军队演出时，士兵们个个都看得眉飞色舞，并且常常在节目还在进行时就情不自禁地鼓起掌来。
          难忘的歌舞
    无论在那个城市演出，歌舞团的每一个节目都受到了观众热烈的欢迎。像明朗、活泼的“花伞舞”，轻盈、优美的彝族舞蹈“把披毡献给毛主席”、富有民族风格的“狮舞”以及表现农村一片欢乐景象的“人民公社庆丰收”等舞蹈都深深地吸引着观众，博得了不断的掌声和叫好声。一位埃及女艺术家如醉如痴地为每一个节目叫好。她说，每一个节目都是如此令人神往，不仅舞蹈具有魅力，而且中国的音乐真是感人至深。人们还赞扬“凉山民间舞”表现了中国民族英勇豪迈的性格，也热爱“纺织姑娘”舞所表现的劳动的愉快。观众对于中国乐队的相互配合以及舞蹈演员动作的协调和谐都给予极高的评价。一个观众说得好，只有集体性最强的民族才能在演出时相互配合得如此良好。特别是观众对“伟大的毛泽东”这支歌曲所表现的热烈情绪真是难以描绘，每次当报幕员报告演唱这个歌曲时，台下就响起春雷般的掌声。当歌舞团在伊斯美利亚城的一个俱乐部里作客时，一个曾经听过这支歌曲的军官，一再恳切地要求演员们当场再为他们演唱一遍。歌舞团的器乐合奏每一次都不得不在热烈的鼓掌声中再为观众们奏上一曲。他们说，中国音乐表现了中国人民高度的智慧和文化。
    在这些日子里，埃及的报刊杂志和画报登载了不少介绍中国四川省歌舞团演出的文章和图片，它们给这次演出以极高的评价和赞扬。“埃及进步报”说，“不平常的美妙的演出，把我们带到了一个梦样的境界。”“我的祖国”周报说“中国四川省歌舞团的演出是用真正的艺术来吸引观众的，我们应该把他们的演出看成是如何发展普及艺术和民间舞蹈的很好一课。”画报上的一篇文章说，“中国歌舞团所有的舞蹈和歌唱都充满欢乐的情绪，充满崇高纯洁的意境，中国四川歌舞团在阿联两个地区的演出，是阿联文艺界的一件大事，我们可以学习很多的东西，我们应该学习如何用歌舞来表达一种愉快，乐观和积极的感情。”
          长在的友情
    的确，中国四川歌舞团在阿联的演出，不仅把中国人民无限欢乐的心情，勤劳勇敢的性格以及他们对于现实生活的热爱，对于美好未来的理想和对于伟大领袖毛泽东的敬爱通过歌声、舞蹈表达给阿联人民，同时也把中国人民的友谊传送给阿联人民；另一方面从观众的热情赞语和报刊的极高评价中也深深地感受到阿联人民对中国人民的友谊的热烈的回答。就在歌舞团停留在埃及地区的这些日子里，演员们不论走在街头、走在海滨或者在游览名胜古迹时，随时都会遇到亲切的微笑，友好的招呼，他们会停下来和你热烈地握手，向你说上几句表达他们友好心意的话。希望演员们留下一个签名，合拍一张照片……。有一次演出后，一个小姑娘等待一个演员为她签名，足足等了半个多小时。她的父亲向这个演员说，“十分感谢你们的演出，我们永远是朋友，虽然我们的国家相距得如此遥远。”当歌舞团结束了在开罗的演出时，“7月26”剧院一个看守后台的老人对演员们说：“你们真是多好的人！这样和蔼可亲，真舍不得你们离开。”还有一个观众在演出结束后，特别找到歌舞团的翻译，他说，“感谢你们为我们带来了这样美好的艺术，不久前，美国一个歌舞团也在这里演出过，但是你们的表演不知比他们好多少倍，你们的歌舞不仅有美的形式，而且有丰富的内容”。
    中国四川省歌舞团已经离开了热情友好的阿联人民，他们在这里为阿联朋友们留下了令人难忘的歌舞，留下了中国人民的友情，同时他们也带走了无限美好的记忆和永远长在的阿联人民对中国人民的友情。
