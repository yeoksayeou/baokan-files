    Political Education Under the Mercury Lamp
    ——Production Notes for the Film "In the Name of the Revolution"
    By Shi Daqian, Director of Beijing Film Studio
    Not long ago, we watched the play "Lenin and the Second Generation." At the end of the play, Lenin's words, "Think about the past in the name of the revolution!..." lingered in our ears for a long time. We immediately had a strong desire to bring this stage play to the screen as soon as possible, so that more audiences could relive the firm class stand and revolutionary optimism of the revolutionary predecessors and the masses of people in the years of the October Revolution, thereby educating people to work hard, move forward forever, break through numerous difficulties, and head towards a brilliant communist future.

    Treat Creation with Revolutionary Fighting Spirit

    We were determined to make the film well, but first encountered a difficult problem: how to realistically and vividly reproduce the image of the great revolutionary teacher Lenin on the screen? This was a very good political study.
    Before filming, everyone watched many films about Lenin and consulted reference books and picture materials. Art designers drew diagrams of Lenin's office, makeup artists rushed to make headgear day and night, and costume staff designed clothes according to the style Lenin often wore. Everyone worked hard to shape the image of the revolutionary teacher from all aspects...
    We were enlightened by Lenin's closest people. Krupskaya said in her article "On Dramas Reflecting the October Revolution": "Running too fast and making too many gestures is not correct..." She said, "Caring for people, being compassionate, not being reconciled with the enemies of the revolution, and being full of hatred are not contradictory... He is a very complete person." We also remember Gorky saying: "Lenin is as simple as the truth!"
    We repeatedly understood the meaning of these words, and then explored and researched. The actor's performance quickly moved forward, some trivial movements were removed, and some new inner feelings were generated.
    During the filming process, we repeatedly understood and implemented the instructions of the Party committee leaders: "Whether the image of the revolutionary teacher is filmed well is a political issue." We carefully and meticulously checked every shot related to Lenin. The cinematographer tirelessly selected the best angles from all aspects, and the actors and directors repeatedly studied the lines. In order to understand the spirit of the lines, they also carefully consulted the Complete Works of Lenin. During the hottest time in July, the actors had to wear woolen clothes, cotton vests (to thicken their physique), and woolen overcoats. Zhou Zheng, who played Lenin, and Yu Shizhi, who played Dzerzhinsky, also wore sealed headgear, and were covered in sweat after shooting a single scene. However, the actors rehearsed over and over again without complaining of tiredness or hardship. They deeply realized that they were not acting, but completing an arduous and glorious political task.

    Let the Revolutionary Spirit Live Forever

    The seventh scene was the key scene, in which the revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces launched a decisive battle.
    The studio was unusually quiet, and people's heartstrings were tightly stretched. Everyone was even more excited when filming the fifth shot. This shot showed the scene of the comrades painfully mourning after a young revolutionary was shot and killed by counter-revolutionary elements.
    Before the shooting, the director inspired the actors: "Our closest comrade Yashka has been sacrificed. His enthusiastic singing once accompanied us through many difficult days. He will go to the front line with everyone tomorrow, but now he... We must use practical actions to mourn him."
    The actors were immersed in solemn remembrance. Filming began, and five or six members of the Youth League and Comrade Dzerzhinsky rushed forward, "Yashka!" they called anxiously. Dzerzhinsky bent down to examine his face, and raised his head in grief: "We are too late!" Someone found a poem written by Yashka before his sacrifice in his pocket. The actor playing Donya recited excitedly:
    "Silence, comrades!
    Take off your hats,
    The young Red Army soldier has sacrificed,
    He threw himself into battle,
    With fearless eyes..."
    Donya's excited voice was so moving. Her tears welled up in her eyes, and several young people around her were also very sad. After a while, Donya's tone gradually became stronger. After she finished reading the poem, she raised her head and said solemnly: "Yashka, we swear to you: we will always remember the comrades who sacrificed for the revolution today and the glorious tradition of the revolution. If anyone forgets, even for a moment, we will run to him and say: 'Think about the past in the name of the revolution!'" These words were so powerful and moving that several comrades standing next to the camera also had tears in their eyes. The shot was finished, but people's mood could not calm down for a long time.

    Communist Collaboration Inside and Outside the Factory

    In order to ensure the completion of the film in a short period of time, large-scale collaboration was carried out inside and outside the factory. The director was extremely busy in the studio and could not return to the factory to edit the rushes, so the factory director went to the front line of production to assist the editing technicians in editing the rushes. When there were not enough studios, the "Storm" crew gave up their studio; the lighting workers of the second creative collective took the initiative to come to help; and the electricians of the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio also joined our night battle. The staff of the Beijing Film Processing Factory exerted their energy so that we could see the rushes within five hours, while it usually took one or two days to process the rushes.
    When the Central Conservatory of Music heard that there was no suitable person to compose the music, they recommended a teacher who had just returned from studying in the Soviet Union to be the composer, and the conductor of the Central Orchestra also came to assist. Even the director of the China Children's Theater enthusiastically served as the "on-site director" during the music recording.
    The actors of the film were drawn from the China Children's Theater, the Beijing People's Art Theater, and the Experimental Drama Troupe of the Central Academy of Drama. Some actors performed stage plays while participating in filming. When we did not have enough extras, the Coal Mine Art Troupe and the Dongcheng District Amateur Troupe took the initiative to support us.
    This film is sixteen reels long (more than 13,000 feet) and lasts for two and a half hours. According to the general production speed, it would take about five months to complete. This time, thanks to the leadership of the Party committee and the enthusiastic support of comrades inside and outside the factory, all the actors and staff successfully completed the task in nearly two and a half months.
    The film is completed. We watched it once, twice, three times... We felt strange: in the past, after a film was completed, we always felt that it was not very fresh when we watched it again. But this time the feeling is different. Why? Because we feel that Lenin is still alive among us, and his thoroughly revolutionary thought is shining brightly, forever illuminating our way forward.

    水银灯下的政治教育
    ——影片“以革命的名义”拍摄手记
    北京电影制片厂导演　史大千
    不久以前，我们观看了话剧《列宁与第二代》。剧终时，列宁说的“以革命的名义想想过去！……”这句话，久久萦回在耳边。我们随即产生了一个强烈的愿望：赶紧把这个舞台剧搬上银幕，使更多的观众重温在十月革命胜利的年代里，革命前辈和人民群众坚定的阶级立场和革命的乐观主义精神，从而教育人们艰苦奋斗，永远向前，冲破重重困难，奔向灿烂的共产主义前程。
    以革命的战斗精神对待创作
    我们下决心要把电影拍好，但是首先遇到一个难题：如何在银幕上真实而又生动地再现伟大革命导师列宁的形象呢——这是一场很好的政治学习。
    在拍摄前，大家看了很多关于列宁的影片、参考书和图片资料。美工师绘制列宁办公室的图样，化装师日夜赶制头套，服装人员按照列宁常穿的服装样式进行设计，大家从各方面努力塑造革命导师的形象……。
    我们从列宁最亲近的人那里得到了启示。克鲁普斯卡娅在《谈反映十月革命的戏剧》的文章中说：“跑得太快，手势做得太多，这是不正确的……”她说：“关心人，富有同情心与对革命的敌人毫不调和以及充满仇恨并不矛盾……他是一个非常完整的人。”我们还记得高尔基说的：“列宁就像真理一样朴实！”
    我们反复体会这些话的意思，然后再探索和研究，演员的表演很快就向前迈进了一步，一些琐碎的动作去掉了，产生了一些新的出自内心的感受。
    在拍摄过程中，我们反复体会和贯彻了党委领导同志的指示：“革命导师的形象拍得好不好，是一个政治问题。”我们认真地、细致地检查每一个有关列宁的镜头。摄影师不厌其烦从各个方面挑选最好的角度，演员和导演反复研究台词。为了体会台词的精神，他们还认真地查阅了列宁全集。正当七月里最炎热的时刻，演员们却要穿上呢料的服装、棉背心（为了加厚体型）和呢大衣。扮演列宁的周正和扮演捷尔任斯基的于是之，还戴上密封的头套，拍一个镜头下来就汗流浃背。但是演员们一遍又一遍地排练，从不喊累喊苦。他们深刻地体会到这不是在演戏，而是在完成着一项艰巨而光荣的政治任务。
    让革命的精神永生
    第七场是重点戏，在这场戏里革命和反革命的力量展开了决战。
    摄影棚里格外安静，人们的心弦绷得紧紧的。拍到第五个镜头时，大家更加激动。这个镜头是表现一个年轻的革命者被反革命分子枪杀以后，他的战友们沉痛悼念的场面。
    开拍前，导演启发演员：“我们最亲近的战友亚什卡牺牲了，他生前热情的歌声曾经陪伴我们度过多少艰苦的日月，他明天就要和大家一起开赴前线，可是现在他……，我们要拿实际行动来悼念他。”
    演员浸沉在庄严的怀念中。开始拍摄了，五、六个青年联盟的盟员和捷尔任斯基同志一起向前奔来，“亚什卡！”他们急切地叫着。捷尔任斯基弯下腰来察看他的面孔，悲痛地抬起头来：“我们来晚了！”有人从亚什卡的口袋里发现了他牺牲前写的一首诗。扮演冬尼亚的演员激动地朗诵起来：
    “肃静，同志们！
    摘下帽子，
    年轻的红军战士已经牺牲，
    他投入战斗，
    带着无畏的眼神……”
    冬尼亚激动的声音，那么动人。她的热泪涌出眼眶，她身边的几个青年也十分悲痛。一会儿，冬尼亚的语调逐渐刚强起来，她念完了诗，抬起头来庄严地说道：“亚什卡，我们向你宣誓：我们要永远记住今天为革命牺牲了的同志和革命的光荣传统，要是有人忘记，哪怕是忘记了一刹那，我们也要跑到他的跟前对他说：‘以革命的名义想想过去！’”这段话说得如此有力、感人，以至站在摄影机旁的好几个同志的眼角也都湿润了。镜头拍完了，可是人们的心情却久久不能平静下来。
    厂内外共产主义协作
    为了保证影片在短期内完成，厂内外展开了大协作。导演在摄影棚里忙得不可开交，不能回厂编样片，厂长就亲临生产第一线，协助剪接技师把样片编好。摄影棚不够用，《暴风骤雨》摄制组就把摄影棚让出来；第二创作集体的照明工主动赶来帮忙；中央新闻纪录电影厂的配电工也投入了我们的夜战。北京电影洗印厂职工发挥干劲，使我们在五小时内就能看到样片，而一般洗印样片需一、两天时间。
    中央音乐学院听说没有合适的人作曲，就推荐了一位刚从苏联留学回来的教师担任作曲，中央乐团的指挥也赶来协助。连中国儿童剧院的院长也热情地当了音乐录音时的“现场指导”。
    影片的演员是从中国儿童剧院、北京人民艺术剧院、中央戏剧学院实验话剧团抽调出来的，有的演员一面演出舞台剧，一面参加拍电影。当我们的群众演员不足时，煤矿文工团、东城区业余剧团就主动来支援。
    这部影片共长十六本（一万三千余尺），放映时间达两个半小时。按照一般生产速度约需五个月时间才能拍成，这次由于全体演员和职员在党委领导下，并且有厂内外同志热情的支援，终于在将近两个半月的时间内胜利地完成了任务。
    影片完成了，我们看了一次、两次、三次……感到奇怪的是：过去一部影片完成后，自己再去看总感到并不怎么新鲜。而这次的感觉就不一样了，这是为什么呢？因为我们感觉到：列宁仍然活在我们中间，他那彻底革命的思想光芒万丈，永远照射着我们前进的道路。（附图片）
