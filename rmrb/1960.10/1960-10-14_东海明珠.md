　　Pearl of the East China Sea
　　Yuan Ying

　　"The eighteen bends of Zhoushan, each bend yields gold and treasures." This saying describes the abundance of products on Zhoushan Island, like inexhaustible gold and silver treasures. It is equally fitting to use this saying to compare the thousands of islands in the Zhoushan archipelago. Those large and small islands scattered across the East China Sea are like pearls and gems, inlaid on the green glass of rolling waves, colorful, glittering and dazzling. However, it is even more appropriate to use this "gold and treasure" to describe the Zhoushan archipelago people's determination to become strong, to change their appearance, and their spirit of seeking grain from the islands and treasures from the sea.

　　If you don't believe it, take a look at Ant Island.

　　When the commune's ship we were on had just docked at Ant Island, several large motorized junks docked at the wharf were ringing with the sound of machinery being handled. Several young lads and fishing girls were working hard on the deck, sweating profusely. As soon as they saw the ship returning, they shouted towards the ship:

　　"Is Secretary Li back? Are the parts here?"

　　The deputy secretary of the commune party committee was standing on the deck of the ship, busy carrying two boxes of machine parts and tools that had just been brought back from Shenjiamen ashore. He pointed to a pair of large motorized junks being repaired and said to us:

　　"Look, these are the straw rope boats, now they've been refitted!"

　　We knew something about the origin of the straw rope boats. In 1954, the Party pointed out to the fishermen: "March into the distant seas!" It pointed out the goal for the coastal fishermen to move forward. The fishermen of Ant Island responded to the Party's call with great enthusiasm, eager to try, preparing to leave Taohua Port and go to the distant seas for the first time. But to go to the distant seas, you need big ships, how could small seine boats withstand the wind and waves of the distant seas? At that time, although the four-cooperative merged into one and the government and commune merged into one had just been established, forming a large family with the nature of a people's commune, Ant Island was still a poor island. The only large wooden boat in the whole commune was confiscated from the fishing bosses. The total public accumulation fund of the four cooperatives was only ten yuan. How much does it cost to build a pair of large fishing boats? It costs almost ten thousand yuan. The government provided loans and built three of them. But the fishermen said: We are the builders of the country, can we only rely on "handout" cigarettes? The women said: We must twist straw ropes to twist out a pair of large fishing boats! Thus, a bitter battle for boats began. All the women on the island, from grandmothers to young girls, worked together, twisting for three days and three nights, exchanging it for nine thousand yuan, and indeed earning back a pair of large fishing boats. This was the first pair of boats built by the people of Ant Island with their own hands to build a distant ocean fleet. Later, when naming this fleet, some people suggested naming these memorable boats "Women's No. 1". The women disagreed. They said: This is only the beginning of our women's contribution to socialist construction. Let's take the name "Women's No. 1" when we build motorized junks, the days are still long! Everyone thought, this makes sense, let's just call them "Straw Rope Boats", firstly to commemorate the women's achievements; secondly, "It's difficult to start twisting ropes, it's difficult to start doing things". The commune had just been established, and there are still many difficulties ahead. Taking this name can also encourage everyone not to be complacent, and always maintain the energy of twisting straw ropes to make boats.

　　This is an old story. These boats have been refitted when the commune realized motorization last year, and have also been officially named "Women's No. 1", but people still call them by their original name with a sense of pride and affection, just like mothers always like to call their grown-up children's nicknames.

　　From the wharf meandering westward, you can see rows of tile houses and thatched houses, some splitting bamboo, some sawing wood, some forging iron. In those concentrated few rooms, there are five lathes, planers and drills.

　　Coming here, the deputy secretary of the party committee is even more like returning to his own home, introducing these workshops and machines to outsiders, just like introducing his family members. This is not only because he is in charge of industry in the party committee's division of labor, and works with the workers all day long, dealing with machines; but also because he is one of the earliest workers in the commune, one of the earliest technicians. These factories started from scratch and expanded day by day; these young mechanics have grown from high school graduates to skilled technicians, to skilled marine engineers, increasing day by day, there is the Party's hard work in this, and also his own effort.

　　"Earlier," the deputy secretary said, "when the machines broke down, they had to go to Shenjiamen Zhoushan Shipyard for repairs. The comrades of the shipyard were very enthusiastic, but it cost more than a thousand yuan to repair them once, and there were too many ships, so queuing up would take at least ten days and a half months. If a pair of boats stopped for ten days and a half months, how many fish would be caught! The party committee said, we must make a decision to repair them ourselves! In three days, the factory was set up."

　　This repair shop set up in three days, all the tools and materials, were a batch of old materials collected from the boats, only a wooden bench was made as a workbench, which was considered the only newly purchased equipment. There were only five workers in total (one of whom was this deputy secretary). Five people gritted their teeth, learning while doing, trying while repairing, and repaired a diesel engine, installed it on the boat under the boat boss's uneasy gaze, and went to the ocean to catch hairtail. On the day the boat left the port, the five people stood on the wharf, squinting their eyes to watch carefully, pricking up their ears to listen carefully, until the shadow of the boat disappeared in the distance of the sea and sky, they still didn't want to leave, as if five hearts were all taken to the distant ocean by that pair of boats. The deputy secretary said with a smile:

　　"Those days, I was really worried, I couldn't even eat, I didn't know if the machine would have problems. It wasn't until the boat returned safely that I was relieved."

　　This happened in 1958.

　　In 1959, this factory began to manufacture its own motorized junks.

　　"This year, we have achieved minor repairs without leaving the cabin, medium repairs without leaving the boat, and major repairs without leaving the commune." When saying this, the deputy secretary of the party committee couldn't restrain his joyful and excited mood. This Ant Island native who came from a fishing family spent his childhood in the small boat of turbulent waves and the thatched shed where he couldn't get enough to eat or wear in the old system. The Party has trained him from an ordinary fisherman to an expert in machinery, and trained him into an outstanding cadre who can be responsible for all the industries of a commune.

　　This spirit of hard work and practical work has become a social atmosphere on Ant Island. When they saw in the newspaper that a certain place in Anhui was trial-producing wind-powered engines, they immediately sent people to learn from it; when the number of motorized junks increased, they selected some teenagers to learn from the boat boss and marine engineer for three or four months as a serious task; the commune bears the cost of learning and living for young people who go to technical schools outside to study machinery and aquaculture;... When we walk around on Ant Island, we can see the style of "twisting straw ropes to twist out a big pair of boats" everywhere: the "Three Gates Yamen" where the fishing bosses used to live is painted with five big characters: Accumulation Place for Waste Products. People pick up the used straw ropes from the seabed, densely tie another layer of straw, and can use them for half a year; old nets, old bamboo, old bamboo strips, which were originally treated as waste products, are now rejuvenated by the hardworking hands of people. Whether on the street or by the sea, whether in the workshop or on the boat, thrift has become the most commonly used word by people. After the commune members compare their thinking, compare their energy, and compare their learning, there is also a comparison: compare bank deposits. Everyone understands: it is the most glorious thing to save money and deposit it in the bank to support national construction or invest in increasing public wealth, while extravagance and waste are the most disgraceful shame. Even the children know thrift. When they see a broken tool or even a small piece of wood thrown there on the side of the street that no one cares about, they will pick it up and hand it over to the "Waste Accumulation Place", or, they will shout:

　　"Thrift, pick it up quickly."

　　We bid farewell to Ant Island on a noisy morning and returned to Dinghai. The commune party committee called on all commune members to fight hard for seven days and overfulfill the production plan for offshore and distant sea operations to welcome the birthday of our great republic. The motorized junks repairing machines in the repair shop are rushing to repair them day and night, a pair of pairs are setting sail and going out to sea, riding the wind and waves straight to the Shengsi sea area, to catch the sweetfish season. That pair of straw rope boats had already been repaired and sailed yesterday; another pair of boats are erecting masts, loading water and diesel from the shore onto the boat; the motor sound in the repair shop has not stopped all night, shattering the morning mist on the sea; in the woodworking workshop, the day shift workers have just started work, sawing wood and splitting bamboo strips. At the pier, several old people are mending nets and tying straw ropes; a group of Young Pioneers are picking up loads of jellyfish from the boats returning at night and carrying them to the processing factory. The production team members participating in the near-sea operations went to the outside of the port before dawn, and at this moment they are probably scooping up net after net of jellyfish and fish and shrimp.

　　The ship left the shore. The secretary of the party committee waved to us again, said a few more words to the people repairing the boat, and hurried back to the office. Last night, the general meeting of all commune members to discuss saving food was held until late at night, and the secretary of the party committee still insisted on the system of studying for two hours in the morning. The deputy secretary still returned to his factory, these days he is personally guiding a small youth in making a steam stove for the canteen.

　　The ship increased its speed, and the voices of people and machines on the shore became farther and farther, lighter and lighter. But, Ant Island, Ant Island, even if we go ten thousand miles away, to the end of the world, we will always hear your loud voice. Your hundreds of voices, the footsteps of your more than two thousand commune members advancing side by side with one heart and one mind, have converged into sixteen big characters, which are painted on the roof of the Hou'ao Middle School and can be seen clearly from afar: Work hard to become strong, struggle hard, rely on our own efforts, and change our appearance. This is the voice that represents the will of 600 million Chinese people. It will always inspire people's hearts like the waves of the East China Sea, and it will always shine like the pearls of the East China Sea!

    东海明珠
    袁鹰
    “舟山十八坳，坳坳出的金和宝。”这话说的是舟山岛上物产丰饶，就像金银财宝那样采不尽，用不完。若是用这句话来比拟舟山群岛的上千个岛屿，也同样合适。那些星罗棋布在东海上的大大小小的岛屿，像一颗颗明珠，一颗颗宝石，镶嵌在滚腾着碧浪的绿玻璃上，五彩缤纷，晶莹夺目。然而，若是把这“金和宝”用来比拟舟山群岛人民的发愤图强、改变面貌的志气，向岛要粮、向海要宝的气概，就更加合适了。
    不信且看蚂蚁岛。
    我们乘坐的公社的航船刚在蚂蚁岛靠岸的时候，停靠在码头上的几只大机帆船上，正响着摆弄机器的叮叮当当的声音。几个年青的小伙子和渔家姑娘，在甲板上正忙得满头大汗，一见航船回来了，就朝着船上嚷嚷：
    “李书记回来了？零件有了吗？”
    公社党委副书记正站在航船的甲板上，一面忙着把两箱刚从沈家门配回来的机器零件和工具搬上岸，一面指着一对正在修理的大机帆船对我们说：
    “喏，这就是草绳船，现在已经改装了！”
    草绳船的来历，我们是晓得一些的。1954年，党向渔民指出：“向远洋进军！”为沿海渔民指出了前进的目标。蚂蚁岛的渔民们兴高彩烈地响应了党的号召，磨拳擦掌，准备走出桃花港，第一次到远洋去。可是，去远洋，就得要大船，小小的张网船怎么受得住远洋的风浪呢？当时，虽是刚刚成立了四社合一、政社合一的大社，虽是合成了一个具有人民公社性质的大家庭，但是，蚂蚁岛毕竟是个穷岛啊，全社仅有的一只大木船还是从渔霸手里没收来的，四个社交到一起的公积金，总共才只有十块钱。打一对大捕鱼船要多少钱呢？差不多要一万块钱。政府给贷了款，打了三只。可是渔民们说：我们是国家的建设者，不能只吃“伸手牌”香烟呵？妇女们说：搓草绳也要搓出一对大捕鱼船来！于是，一场为船而战的苦战开始了，全岛妇女，从老婆婆到小姑娘，一起动手，搓了三天三夜，换来了九千元，果然赚回了一对大捕鱼船。这是蚂蚁岛人民用自己的双手建设远洋船队的第一对船。后来给这支船队定名的时候，有人建议给这对值得纪念的船命名为“妇女一号”，妇女们却不同意，她们说：这才只是我们妇女为社会主义建设出力的开头，到办机帆船的时候再取个“妇女一号”吧，日子还长得很哩！大家一想，这道理也对，干脆就叫它们“草绳船”吧，一来纪念妇女们的功绩；二来呢，“搓绳起头难，办事开头难”。大社刚成立，前面还有许多困难，取这个名字，也可以勉励大家不要自满，永远保持搓草绳搓出船来的那股干劲。
    这是旧话了。这对船在去年公社实现机帆化的时候已经改了装，也已经被正式命名为“妇女一号”，但是，人们仍然怀着一种自豪而亲切的心情，叫着它们的本名，就像母亲总爱叫唤长大了的儿女的乳名一样。
    从码头迤逦向西，就看到一排排瓦屋和草屋，有的在劈竹子，有的在锯木材，有的在打铁，在那集中的几间里，摆着五台车床、刨床和钻床。
    来到这里，党委副书记就更像回到自己的家，向外人介绍这些车间和机器，就跟介绍自己家里人一样。这不仅因为他在党委分工管工业，整天跟工人一起劳动，跟机器打交道；更因为他是社里最早的工人之一，最早的技术人员之一。这些厂子白手起家，一天天扩展；这些年青的机械工人们从高小毕业生到成为熟练的技工，成为熟练的轮机手，一天天增加，这当中有党的心血，也有他的一份努力。
    “早先”，副书记说：“机器坏了，就要上沈家门舟山船厂去修。船厂的职工同志很热情，可是去修一次就是一千多元，船太多，一排队，起码就要十天半月。一对船停十天半月，要少捕多少鱼！党委说，下决心自己来修！三天工夫，就把工厂办起来了。”
    这个三天办起来的修配厂，全部工具和材料，都是从船上搜罗来的一批旧料，只打了一张木凳当工作台，算是唯一新置的设备。工人一共就是五个（其中一个就是这位副书记）。五个人咬紧牙关，边学边干，边试边修，把一台柴油机修好，在船老大不太放心的眼光注视下装上船，出洋捕带鱼去了。船离港的那天，五个人伫立在码头上，眯起眼睛细看，竖起耳朵细听，直到船影在海天远处消失，还不想离开，就像五颗心全被那对船带到远洋去了。副书记笑着说：
    “那几天呀，真是提心吊胆，饭也吃勿落，不知那台机器会不会出毛病。一直到船安全地回来，才放下心。”
    这是1958年的事。
    1959年，还是这个厂，就开始自己制造机帆船了。
    “今年，我们做到了小修不出舱，中修不出船，大修不出社。”说这话的时候，党委副书记抑止不住喜悦而激动的心情。这个渔工出身的蚂蚁岛人，旧制度在惊涛骇浪的小船上和吃不饱穿不暖的草棚里送走了他的少年时光，党把他从一个普通的捕鱼人培养成为搞机器的内行，培养成能负责一个公社全部工业的出色干部。
    这种苦干实干的精神，在蚂蚁岛已经成为一种社会风气。看到报上登了安徽什么地方在试制风力推动机，马上就派人去取经；机帆船增加了，就挑选一部分青少年去跟老大和轮机手学三、四个月，作为一项严肃的任务；到外面技术学校学习机器、水产的年青人，公社负担他们的学习和生活费用；……我们在蚂蚁岛上走来走去，到处都能看到“搓草绳搓出大对船来”的风格：当年渔霸住的“三道衙门”，刷上五个大字：废品积累处。人们从海底把用过的草绠捞起来，密密地再扎上一层稻草，又能使上半年；老网、老竹、老篾，原来都作为废品处理的，现在经过人的勤劳的双手，让它们再恢复青春。不论在街上还是在海边，不论在车间还是船上，勤俭，成了人们最常用的字眼。社员们在比思想、比干劲、比学习之后，还有一比：比银行存款。人人都懂得：把钱节约下来存到银行支援国家建设或者投资增加公共财富，是最光荣的事，而挥霍浪费，却是一种最不光彩的耻辱。连孩子们也都知道勤俭，当他们在街边看到一件坏了的工具甚至一块小的木头扔在那里没有人管的时候，也会去捡起来，交到“废品积累处”去，或者，就?喝一声：
    “勤俭噢，快快拾起来。”
    我们在一个喧闹的清晨告别蚂蚁岛回定海去。公社党委号召全体社员大战七天，超额完成远近洋作业的生产计划来迎接我们伟大共和国的生日。在修配厂修理机器的大机帆船，夜以继日地抢修，一对一对地扬帆出海，乘风破浪直驶嵊泗洋面，去赶桂花鱼汛。那对草绳船已经在昨天修好开洋了；另一对船正在竖起桅杆，从岸上往船上装水装柴油；修配厂里马达声彻夜未停，震碎了海面上的晓雾；木工车间里，白班工人刚上班，在锯木材，劈竹篾。在埠头，几位老年人正在补网和扎草绠；一群少先队员正在从夜里回来的船上，把一担担的海蜇往加工厂里挑。参加近洋作业的生产队员们，那是在天还没有亮以前就到港外去，此刻大约正在捞起一网又一网的海蜇和鱼虾。
    航船离岸了。党委书记向我们再一次挥挥手，同修船的人们又说了几句话，就匆匆地往回办公室的路上走。昨夜，讨论节约粮食的全体社员大会开到深夜，党委书记还是坚持早晨学习两小时的制度。副书记仍旧回到他的厂里去，这几天他正亲自指导一个一个小青年在为食堂做一只蒸汽炉。
    航船增加了速度，岸上的人声机器声也越来越远，越来越轻。可是，蚂蚁岛啊蚂蚁岛，纵使走到万里以外，走到天边，我们也会永远听到你那宏亮的声音的。你的千百种声音，你的两千多社员一心一德并肩前进的脚步声，汇成了十六个大字，那就是刷在后坳中学校屋顶上、老远就看得清清楚楚的十六个字：发愤图强，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，改变面貌。这是代表了中国六亿人民意志的声音。它将像东海浪涛一样永远激荡人心，像东海明珠一样永远光辉四射！
