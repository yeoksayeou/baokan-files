    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The Japanese Communist Party yesterday presented a suggestion to the Socialist Party regarding a joint struggle between the two parties against the revival of Japanese militarism and fascism.
    The suggestion stated that it is an important task for the Socialist Party and the Communist Party to jointly organize the broad masses of the people and enable them to participate in the struggle, working to demand the punishment of all criminals related to the assassination of Asanuma, to investigate the background of Asanuma's assassination, and to stop the fascization of Japan. The suggestion pointed out that the purpose of the assassination of Asanuma is to deprive the people of the fruits of their opposition to the "Security Treaty."
    The suggestion emphasized that all progressive forces in Japan hope to see the two parties strengthen their joint struggle against U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capitalism.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: The Japanese Communist Party has suggested that various trade unions launch a joint struggle with the Communist Party and the Socialist Party to overthrow militarism and fascism.
    Suzuki Ichizo, a member of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Japanese Communist Party, met with Ota Kaoru, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), on the afternoon of the 19th, and handed him a suggestion to strengthen the unified action of all democratic forces, including "Sohyo," the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party, to protest against the reactionaries' murder of Inejiro Asanuma and to smash the conspiracy to further militarize and fascize Japan.
    Then, Suzuki Ichizo met with Yoshida Chuzaburo, Chairman of the National Railway Workers' Union, and Kobayashi Takeshi, Chairman of the Japan Teachers Union, and handed them identical suggestions respectively.
    On the same day, representatives of the Japanese Communist Party also submitted suggestions for launching a joint struggle against militarism and fascism to the Federation of Independent Unions, the All Japan Shipbuilding and Engineering Union, the National Metal Workers' Union, the Japanese Federation of Synthetic Chemistry Workers Unions, the Japan Iron and Steel Industry Workers' Unions, and the Private Railway Workers' Union Federation.
    In its suggestions, the Japanese Communist Party said that the assassination of Asanuma, the leader of the largest opposition party, on the eve of the general election is unprecedented and is obviously a conspiracy planned by reactionary forces. The criminal is a pawn of Japanese monopoly capital who undermines workers' movements in various regions.
    The suggestion emphasized that the current situation is very serious. With the further concentration of monopoly capital, the revival of Japanese militarism, and the strengthening of the Japan-U.S. military alliance, right-wing violent groups are becoming increasingly rampant. The Japanese Communist Party pointed out that crushing the militarist and fascist forces that are stepping up their activities is the most urgent task for all democratic movements at present.

    日共向社会党和各工会建议
    展开共同斗争反对军国主义
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本共产党昨天向社会党提出了关于两党展开反对复活日本军国主义和法西斯主义的联合斗争的建议。
    建议书说，两党共同把广大的人民群众组织起来，使他们参加斗争，为了要求惩办一切与刺杀浅沼事件有关的凶犯，查清刺杀浅沼的背景和制止日本法西斯化而努力，这是社会党和共产党的重要任务。建议书指出，刺杀浅沼的目的在于剥夺人民反对“安全条约”的成果。
    建议书强调说，日本一切进步力量希望看到两党加强反对美帝国主义和日本垄断资本主义的联合斗争。
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本共产党建议各个工会同共产党和社会党展开联合斗争，打倒军国主义和法西斯主义。
    日共中央干部会委员铃木市藏19日下午会见日本工会总评议会议长太田熏，并交给他一项建议书，建议加强展开包括“总评”、社会党、共产党在内的全体民主力量的统一行动，抗议反动派杀害浅沼稻次郎，粉碎使日本进一步军国主义化和法西斯化的阴谋。
    然后，铃木市藏会见了国营铁道工会委员长吉田忠三郎和教职员工会委员长小林武，分别向他们递交了内容相同的建议书。
    同一天，日共代表还向中立工会联合会、全日本造船工会、全国金属工会、合成化学产业工会联合会、日本铁钢产业工会联合会和私营铁道工会联合会递交了展开反对军国主义和法西斯主义联合斗争的建议书。
    日共在建议书里说，在大选前夕，最大的在野党领袖浅沼的被杀害是前所未有的，显然这是反动势力所策划的阴谋。凶犯是破坏各地工人运动的日本垄断资本的走卒。
    建议书强调指出，目前情况是很严重的。随着垄断资本的更加集中和日本军国主义的复活以及日美军事同盟的加强，右翼暴力团体越来越猖獗。日共指出，粉碎正在加紧活动的军国主义和法西斯势力，这是所有民主运动目前最紧要的课题。
