Xinhua News Agency, October 13th, New York dispatch: At the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly on the afternoon of the 11th, a sharp struggle, essentially about whether or not to disarm, unfolded around the procedural issue of discussing disarmament. The imperialist countries, headed by the United States, feared that discussing disarmament at the United Nations General Assembly would expose their true colors of adhering to arms expansion and war preparations and consistently obstructing disarmament. They resolutely opposed discussing the disarmament issue at the plenary session of the Assembly. This unreasonable position was unanimously and sternly condemned by the representatives of the socialist countries. The United States finally manipulated the voting machine to reject the Soviet proposal to have the United Nations General Assembly directly discuss disarmament, and forcibly decided to hand over the disarmament issue to the General Assembly's Political Committee for discussion.

	Soviet Premier Khrushchev spoke first at the afternoon session. He said, we are deciding on some issues that need to be discussed at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly. The issue of disarmament—this is the issue of issues. He said that in the current conditions, the issue of disarmament is the most fundamental issue, and whether the consolidation of peace can be guaranteed depends on its resolution. No issue, no matter how important, can compare with this issue, because whether a new world war breaks out depends on this issue.

	Khrushchev said that if the disarmament issue continues to be delayed, as it has been delayed until now, there is a danger of events developing in the same direction as in the era of the League of Nations before the Second World War.

	Khrushchev said that the representatives of Western countries say that there is no time to discuss the disarmament issue, but they spare no time to maintain international tension and prevent the normalization of relations between countries. Through their activities, they have created a situation that makes it impossible to reach a disarmament agreement in the future. The US government is still pursuing Dulles' "brink of war" policy. They are doing everything possible to focus the United Nations' attention on the so-called "Hungarian issue," "Tibetan issue," and other similar issues that the American provocateurs are busy searching for, in order to divert the United Nations' attention from truly important and urgent international issues.

	Khrushchev said that the Soviet delegation firmly insists that it is necessary to discuss the issue of comprehensive and complete disarmament at the UN General Assembly plenary session with the participation of heads of government. If, for one reason or another, it is not possible to fully discuss the disarmament issue at this meeting and reach an agreement at least on the main principles, then the Soviet government considers it necessary to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to submit one issue—the issue of comprehensive and complete disarmament—for discussion at the meeting.

	He said that the UN General Assembly emergency session could be convened in March or April next year, and suggested that the heads of state or government of each country serve as the heads of the delegations attending this meeting.

	U.S. Representative Wadsworth spoke out firmly against discussing the disarmament issue at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly. He distorted the Soviet Union's claim that the purpose of the Assembly's discussion of the disarmament issue was not for disarmament but for conducting "a large-scale propaganda of table-thumping", and to "make lengthy speeches." He used the "complexity" of the disarmament issue as an excuse, insisting that only in the Political Committee could "serious consideration" be given. Wadsworth also distorted the truth of the disarmament negotiations over the past ten years, whitewashed the consistent and deliberate obstruction of the disarmament issue by the Western countries, especially the United States, and attempted to shift the responsibility for sabotaging the disarmament negotiations to the Soviet Union.

	Wadsworth rejected Khrushchev's proposal to convene a UN General Assembly emergency session next spring to discuss disarmament. He clamored that the disarmament issue "will not produce miracles in the (UN General Assembly) plenary session. It will not produce miracles in the UN General Assembly special session." According to the Associated Press, Wadsworth had publicly stated before attending the afternoon meeting that the United Nations already has a "disarmament committee, and there is no need to convene a special meeting at all."

	Canadian Representative Green followed the United States in opposing the discussion of the disarmament issue at the United Nations General Assembly. Green insisted that the atmosphere in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly seemed "more conducive" to reaching an agreement. Green also defended the actions of Western countries, including Canada, in undermining the work of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee.

	British Representative Ormsby-Gore repeated the claims of the American and Canadian representatives at the meeting, insisting that discussing the disarmament issue at the General Assembly plenary session violated "the established procedures of the United Nations" and "was incompatible with the Assembly."

	Ormsby-Gore also disagreed with the claim that heads of government could participate in the discussion of the disarmament issue at the Assembly. He said that some of these "esteemed visitors" had already left New York, and "this reason is untenable." He also said that he did not agree with the view that the Political Committee's discussion of the disarmament issue was a belittlement of the importance of the issue. He hoped that the Political Committee could "soon" start working on the disarmament issue.

	Czechoslovak Foreign Minister David spoke, advocating discussing the issue of comprehensive and complete disarmament at the General Assembly plenary session, and supported Khrushchev's proposal to convene a UN General Assembly emergency session in March and April next year to discuss disarmament. David emphasized that the history of disarmament negotiations proves that Western countries are attempting to use disarmament negotiations to cover up their arms race.

	Bulgarian Foreign Minister Lukanov supported the Soviet proposal and pointed out that the so-called "disarmament" proposals put forward by Western countries do not have any specific disarmament plans or deadlines.

	Albanian Representative Shtulla supported the Soviet proposal. He also emphasized that without the participation of the People's Republic of China, it is impossible to resolve the issue of comprehensive and complete disarmament. Therefore, he firmly demanded that the Chiang Kai-shek elements be driven out of the United Nations, so that the representatives of the People's Republic of China could occupy the seat that belongs to them.

	Hungarian Representative Sik said that the demand of certain delegations not to discuss the disarmament issue at the UN General Assembly plenary session can only have one explanation, which is that they are afraid of public opinion and are attempting to conceal their position from the people who hope for peace.

	Ukrainian Foreign Minister Paramarchuk emphasized that the Western countries' firm opposition to discussing the disarmament issue at the General Assembly plenary session proves their consistent unwillingness to end the arms race. He said that because the disarmament negotiations have reached a deadlock, the disarmament issue needs to be discussed by the United Nations General Assembly plenary session with the participation of national leaders.

	Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki refuted the American representative's fallacy of slandering the socialist countries' advocacy of discussing the disarmament issue at the Assembly as pursuing "propaganda" purposes. He pointed out that the issue of comprehensive and complete disarmament should be discussed at the highest organ of the United Nations—the United Nations General Assembly plenary session.

	Belarusian Representative Mazurov pointed out that the United States' opposition to a broad discussion of this issue at the plenary session exposed who is obstructing the resolution of the disarmament issue. He condemned the United States for refusing to discuss issues of paramount importance such as disarmament, and forcibly stuffing provocative issues such as the so-called "Tibetan issue" and "Hungarian issue" that it created into the Assembly's agenda.

	Romanian Representative Mischincescu pointed out that the position of the United States, Britain, Canada, and certain other countries shows that they do not want to break the deadlock in disarmament negotiations and do not want to conduct serious negotiations.

	After the Romanian representative spoke, Khrushchev spoke again to respond to the speeches of the Western representatives. Khrushchev said that we had been in a five-nation committee with Britain, the United States, Canada, France, and the Soviet Union. We saw that the only serious thing this committee did was to drink tea and coffee. (Laughter in the hall) Meetings, meetings, one person speaks, another listens, and the third asks to move the meeting to the next day. And so on, endlessly. He said that this is not an organization to resolve the disarmament issue, but a cover to deceive public opinion and deceive the people. And we don't want to participate in this deception.

	Khrushchev said, I see Jules Moch sitting here, he is a socialist, he wasted a lot of words in the Ten-Nation Committee, what was the result? Nothing.

	French President de Gaulle believes that in order to reach a disarmament agreement, it is necessary to start with the destruction of nuclear weapons delivery vehicles to achieve this agreement. I still support this view of French President de Gaulle.

	Mr. Jules Moch later reiterated Mr. de Gaulle's words at a press conference or somewhere else. However, when Jules Moch came to the committee, he said something completely different. This is another Jules Moch, not the one who spoke in public, but another one.

	Khrushchev said that we still have a little patience, and there is still a final hope that the UN General Assembly can help reach a disarmament agreement at its plenary session, so as to finally save mankind from the scourge of war. The Soviet Union is not afraid of war! If someone imposes war on us, we will fight for our country. No matter how much sacrifice we make, we will win!

	He added, but it must not be forgotten that the losses in such a war would be incalculable, and those of us sitting here will be responsible for it.

	Khrushchev said that we believe that the struggle for disarmament is not propaganda. But you put forward the "Hungarian and Tibetan issues" in an attempt to cause disputes among countries. Please put them forward, we are not afraid of such issues. We are communists, our minds are sound, and we have been tested in struggle. We fought against the White bandits for four years, we overthrew and smashed the enemies of the working class, and you want to scare us with debates! But, gentlemen, you know that in this respect, if I may say so, your waists are too thin. Gentlemen, we must wake up those who are drowsy here; we must wake up those who are sitting here—the people sent them to the UN General Assembly to discuss the issue of disarmament, but God knows they are wandering around New York, and the people are paying for them.

	Gentlemen, I say, the time will come when you understand the necessity of disarmament. The people will abandon those who create obstacles on the road to peace and mutual understanding and do not create conditions for a disarmament agreement.

	He said, you want to impose an arms race on us, we don't want to, but we are not afraid either. We will definitely defeat you! We are producing rockets in batches. Not long ago, I saw in a factory that rockets were being produced there just like automatic machines making sausages, rockets were being sent out one after another from our factory's production line.

	Someone wants to try how we stand on the earth, you will be crushed by us after you have tried us.

	Khrushchev also said that we are not against the First Committee at all, not at all, I don't even know which is better, which is worse, whether it is better in the First Committee or in the General Assembly. We are just saying that the First Committee has been tried. There were no results there. If we see that this committee is being turned into a cover to deceive the people, just talking about disarmament, but actually doing nothing as in the past, we will withdraw from this committee. We do not make a cover, we do not deceive the working people of the world. He said that if the disarmament issue is to be discussed in the First Committee, then we will participate in the initial stage, and we will see how the discussion is conducted there.

	It may be necessary to pass a resolution to expand the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee. By the way, we once suggested that the committee be composed of representatives from fifteen countries. We agreed to participate in this committee on the condition that there should be representatives from neutral countries participating, as we suggested.

	Khrushchev continued, what proposals did Mr. Macmillan make on this podium? He also said this when he spoke to me: Mr. Khrushchev, you are too anxious, such things cannot be resolved quickly. He said, it must be like this: let us gather together, establish a political committee, let us establish a scientific committee. This scientific committee will decide how best to kill fleas, whether to tear off its legs or chop off its head? (The whole place livened up). This is of course a "scientific question", gentlemen, but this is only suitable for those who do not want to disarm.

	Khrushchev's exposure and condemnation of the Western countries' position made the representatives of the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, become angry and embarrassed. U.S. Secretary of State Herter and Representative Wadsworth were furious when Khrushchev spoke, French Disarmament Representative Moch jumped up from his seat to "protest," and U.S. Representative Wadsworth's face turned red and he was so angry that his "voice was trembling" when he got up to reply.

	In his second speech, Wadsworth still could not come up with any convincing reasons to defend the United States' actions in obstructing disarmament. He could only repeat the platitude that the Soviet Union was conducting "propaganda," and stubbornly clamored that listening to the speeches of the Soviet representatives "is all the more reason why disarmament debates should not be held in this meeting room." French Representative Moch openly denied the fact that France had played double-dealing tricks in the disarmament negotiations and retreated from its original position to obstruct the reaching of an agreement, and even bit back, slandering Khrushchev's accusations against him as "lying."

	Finally, under US pressure, the General Assembly passed the proposal submitted by the General Committee to hand over the disarmament issue to the Political Committee for discussion with 62 votes to 12 and 24 abstentions. Opposing this proposal were Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, the Soviet Union and Cuba, Guinea, Mali. Abstaining were: Afghanistan, Cambodia, Dominica, Ethiopia, Finland, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya , Morocco , Nigeria ,Saudi Arabia,Senegal,Somali,Togo,Tunisia,United Arab Republic,Venezuela,Yemen,Yugoslavia. Following the United States in approving this proposal were: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Ceylon, Cameroon, Canada, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Congo (formerly French Congo), Costa Rica, Cyprus, Dahomey, Denmark, Ecuador, El Salvador, Malaya, France, Gabon, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Iceland, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Côte d'Ivoire, Japan, Laos, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Mexico, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, ​​ Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, South Africa, United Kingdom, United States, Upper Volta, Uruguay, Chiang Kai-shek elements.

	Next, the Assembly rejected the Soviet proposal to discuss the disarmament issue at the General Assembly plenary session with 13 votes to 54 and 31 abstentions. The representatives of the socialist countries, and the representatives of Cuba, Afghanistan, Guinea, and Mali, voted in favor of the Soviet proposal.

	After the vote, Khrushchev strode out of the Assembly hall, leaving all the reporters who asked him questions aside. When Khrushchev returned to the Soviet delegation's office, he said to Western reporters, "You can congratulate the imperialist countries, they can celebrate 'victory', they have undermined the discussion of the disarmament issue at the General Assembly plenary session and brought the world closer to disaster. This is the victory of the forces of war, not the victory of the forces of peace. Every honest person will feel sad about this decision. It looks like the United States, Britain, France, and Canada do not want to disarm, and other countries do not yet understand the necessity of resolving this issue. However, we will spare no effort to fight for peace and expose the warmongers."

	Khrushchev added, "Obviously we will now have to compete in manufacturing weapons."

	When a Western reporter asked him "whether he still saw a glimmer of hope", Khrushchev replied, "At this UN General Assembly session—there is no hope." Khrushchev pointed out, "If the people of all countries shout loudly and force the government to agree to disarmament not in words but in actual actions, then there will be no war. Without the pressure of the people of all countries, the Western governments will not agree to disarmament."

    联大否决苏联要求大会讨论裁军的提案
    赫鲁晓夫等社会主义国家代表揭露西方国家阻挠裁军的立场
    美国代表华兹沃斯叫嚷联大讨论裁军问题“不会出现奇迹”
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：在联合国大会11日下午的全体会议上，环绕着讨论裁军问题的程序问题，展开了一场实质是要不要裁军的尖锐斗争。以美国为首的帝国主义国家害怕在联合国大会上讨论裁军问题会暴露它们坚持扩军备战、一贯阻挠裁军的真面目，坚决反对在大会全体会议上讨论裁军问题，它们的这种无理立场受到社会主义国家的代表们一致的严正谴责。美国最后操纵表决机器，否决苏联要求联合国大会直接讨论裁军的提案，强行决定把裁军问题交给大会政治委员会讨论。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在下午会议上首先发言。他说，我们正在决定一些需要在联合国大会全体会议上讨论的问题。裁军问题——这是问题中的问题。他说，在现在的条件下，裁军问题是最根本的问题，巩固和平能否得到保障取决于它的解决。任何问题，不管有多么重要，都不能同这个问题相比拟，因为新的世界大战是否爆发取决于这个问题。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果将继续拖延裁军问题，正如问题拖延到目前那样，那就有使事件朝着在第二次世界大战前国际联盟时代的那种方向发展的危险。
    赫鲁晓夫说，西方国家的代表说没有时间讨论裁军问题，但是为了保持国际紧张局势，不让各国之间的关系正常化，他们却不吝惜时间。他们通过自己的活动造成了一种使将来无法达成裁军协定的局面。美国政府仍然奉行着杜勒斯的“战争边缘”政策。他们竭尽全力使联合国的注意力集中到所谓“匈牙利问题”、“西藏问题”和美国挑衅活动的能手正在东寻西找的其他类似问题，以转移联合国对国际真正重要的和刻不容缓的问题的注意。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联代表团坚决主张必需在有政府首脑参加的联大全体会议上讨论全面彻底裁军问题。如果由于这种或那种原因未能在这次会议上全面讨论裁军问题并至少在主要原则上达成协议，那末，苏联政府认为有必要召开联合国大会紧急会议来把一个问题——全面彻底裁军问题提交会议讨论。
    他说，联大紧急会议不妨在明年三四月间召开，建议各国家的国家或政府首脑担任出席这次会议的代表团的团长。
    美国代表华兹沃斯发言坚决反对在联合国大会全体会议上讨论裁军问题。他歪曲苏联主张由大会来讨论裁军问题这种主张不是为了裁军而是为了进行“一场拍桌子的大规模的宣传”，是为了“发表长篇演说”。他借口裁军问题的“复杂”性，硬说只有在政治委员会上才能进行“认真的考虑”。华兹沃斯还歪曲十多年来裁军问题谈判的真相，粉饰西方国家、首先是美国一贯蓄意阻挠解决裁军问题的立场，企图把西方国家破坏裁军谈判的责任推给苏联。
    华兹沃斯拒绝赫鲁晓夫提出的在明春召开联大紧急会议讨论裁军问题的建议。他叫嚷说，裁军问题“在（联大）全体会议中讨论不会出现奇迹。在联大特别会议中讨论也不会出现奇迹。”据美联社报道，华兹沃斯在出席下午会议之前已公开表示，联合国已经有了一个“裁军委员会，根本不需要召开一次特别会议。”
    加拿大代表格林追随美国反对在联合国大会上讨论裁军问题。格林硬说在联合国大会的政治委员会中的气氛似乎“更为有助于”达成协议。格林还为包括加拿大在内的西方国家破坏十国裁军委员会的工作的行为辩护。
    英国代表奥姆斯比—戈尔在会上重复了美国和加拿大代表的主张，硬说在大会全体会议上讨论裁军问题违反“联合国的既定程序”，“是同大会不相容的”。
    奥姆斯比—戈尔还不同意在大会上讨论裁军问题可以有政府首脑参加的主张。他说，这些“尊贵的访问者”有些已经离开了纽约，“这个理由是不能成立的”。他还说，他也不同意由政治委员会来讨论裁军问题是贬低这个问题的重要性的意见。他希望政委会能“很快”就裁军问题开始工作。
    捷克斯洛伐克外交部长戴维发言，他主张在大会全体会议上讨论全面彻底裁军问题，并且支持赫鲁晓夫提出的关于在明年三四月间召开联大紧急会议讨论裁军问题的建议。戴维着重指出，裁军谈判的历史证明，西方国家企图利用裁军谈判来掩盖它们的军备竞赛。
    保加利亚外交部部长卢卡诺夫支持苏联的建议并指出，西方国家提出的所谓“裁军”建议没有任何具体的裁军计划和期限。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表什图拉支持苏联的建议。他还强调指出，没有中华人民共和国参加，要想解决全面彻底裁军问题是不可能的。因此，他坚决要求把蒋介石分子赶出联合国，从而使中华人民共和国的代表能够占有应属于他的席位。
    匈牙利代表西克说，某些代表团要求不在联大全体会议上讨论裁军问题，只能有一种解释，就是它们害怕公众舆论，企图对希望和平的人民掩盖自己的立场。
    乌克兰外交部部长帕拉马尔楚克强调指出，西方国家坚决反对在大会全体会议上讨论裁军问题证明了它们一贯不愿意结束军备竞赛。他说，由于裁军谈判已经陷于僵局，裁军问题就需要由有国家领导人参加的联合国大会全体会议来讨论。
    波兰外交部长腊帕茨基驳斥了美国代表诬蔑社会主义国家主张由大会讨论裁军问题是追求“宣传”目的的谬论。他指出，全面彻底裁军问题应当在联合国的最高机构——联合国大会全体会议上讨论。
    白俄罗斯代表马祖罗夫指出，美国反对在全体会议上广泛讨论这个问题暴露了谁在阻挠解决裁军问题。他谴责美国拒绝讨论像裁军这样具有头等意义的问题，而把它所制造的所谓“西藏问题”和“匈牙利问题”这类挑衅性的问题硬塞进大会议程。
    罗马尼亚代表米辛契斯库指出，美国、英国、加拿大和某些其他国家的立场表明，他们不想打开裁军谈判僵局，不想进行认真的谈判。
    罗马尼亚代表发言后，赫鲁晓夫再次发言答复西方代表的发言。赫鲁晓夫说，我们曾经在有英、美、加拿大、法、苏联参加的一个五国委员会里呆过。我们看到，这个委员会唯一认真做的一件事是喝茶，喝咖啡。（场内笑声）开会，开会，一个人讲，另一个人听，第三个人要求把会议移到第二天。就这样，没个完。他说，这不是一个解决裁军问题的机构，而是欺骗舆论、欺骗人民的幌子。而我们不希望参与这种骗局。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我看到这里坐着儒勒·莫克，他是社会党人，他在十国委员会上费了许多口舌，结果怎样呢？一无所得。
    法国总统戴高乐认为为了达成裁军协议，必须从销毁核武器运载工具开始实现这一协议。我现在仍然支持法国总统戴高乐先生的这种主张。
    儒勒·莫克先生此后在记者招待会上或者是还在什么地方，又重申过戴高乐先生的话。但是，儒勒·莫克来到委员会后，所说的却完全是另一番话。这是另一个儒勒·莫克，不是当众讲话的那个，而是另一个。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们还有一点耐力，还有最后的希望使联大能够在它的全体会议上帮助达成裁军协议，以便最后使人类免遭战争的浩劫。苏联是不怕战争的！如果有人把战争强加给我们，我们就为自己的国家而战。无论我们付出多大的牺牲，我们也要取得胜利！
    他又说，但是不能忘记，在这种战争中损失将是不可估计的，我们坐在这里的人也将要对此负责。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为，争取裁军的斗争不是宣传。而你们提出“匈牙利和西藏问题”，是想引起各国的纠纷。请提吧，我们不怕这样的问题。我们是共产党人，我们的头脑是健全的，我们经受过斗争的考验。我们同白匪打过四年仗，我们打倒和粉碎了工人阶级的敌人，而你们却想用辩论会来吓唬我们！可是，诸位先生，你们知道，你们在这方面，如果可以这样比喻的话，腰太细了。诸位先生，我们必须唤醒那些在这里昏昏欲睡的人；必须唤醒在座的人——人民派他们到联大来开会是让他们来讨论裁军问题，可是天晓得他们却在纽约闲逛，而由人民给他们出钱。
    诸位先生，我说，你们了解裁军的必要性的时候就要到来。人民将摒弃那些在通向和平和相互谅解的道路上制造障碍和不为裁军协议创造条件的人。
    他说，你们想把军备竞赛强加于我们，我们不愿意，但是，我们也不怕。我们定会打败你们！我们已在成批地生产火箭。不久前我在一个工厂里看到，那里生产火箭就像自动机器制造香肠一样，火箭一个挨着一个从我们工厂的作业线上送出来。
    有人想试试我们在地球上站得怎么样，你们试过我们之后就会被我们粉碎。
    赫鲁晓夫又说，我们丝毫不反对第一委员会，毫不反对，我甚至不知道哪里好些，哪里差些，在第一委员会里好，还是在大会上好。我们只是说，第一委员会已经尝试过了。那里没有任何结果。如果我们看到，这个委员会被变成欺骗人民的幌子，只是空谈裁军，而实际上同过去一样什么也不干，我们就退出这个委员会。我们不做幌子，不欺骗全世界劳动人民。他说，如果在第一委员会中将讨论裁军问题，那末我们将在最初阶段参加，我们要看一看那里的讨论如何进行。
    可能，有必要通过决议，扩大十国裁军委员会。顺便说说，我们曾经建议由十五个国家的代表组成这个委员会。我们同意参加这个委员会，条件是：那里应有中立国家的代表参加，像我们建议的那样。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，麦克米伦先生在这个讲坛上提出了什么建议呢？他在同我谈话时也这样说：赫鲁晓夫先生，您太着急了，这样的事情不能很快就解决。他说，必须这样：让我们聚集在一起，建立政治委员会，让我们建立科学委员会。这个科学委员会就来决定，怎样弄死跳蚤最好，是扯断它的脚呢，还是掐掉它的头呢？（全场活跃）。这当然是个“科学问题”，先生们，可是，这只对那些不愿裁军的人才合适。
    赫鲁晓夫对西方国家立场的揭露和谴责使美国为首的帝国主义国家代表恼羞成怒，窘态百出。美国国务卿赫脱和代表华兹沃斯在赫鲁晓夫发言时怒气冲冲，法国裁军代表莫克从座位上跳起来“表示抗议”，美国代表华兹沃斯起来答辩时面红耳赤气得“声音发抖”。
    华兹沃斯在他的第二次发言中仍然举不出任何有说服力的理由为美国阻挠裁军的行为辩护。他只能重弹苏联进行“宣传”的滥调，强辞夺理地叫嚷说，听了苏联代表的发言“就更有理由不应该在这个会议室中举行裁军辩论了”。法国代表莫克则公然抵赖法国在裁军谈判中玩弄两面手法、从原有立场倒退以阻挠达成协议的事实，而且反咬一口，诬蔑赫鲁晓夫对他的指责是“说谎”。
    最后，在美国压力下，大会以六十二票对十二票、二十四票弃权通过总务委员会提出的关于把裁军问题交给政治委员会讨论的提案。反对这提案的是阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚、乌克兰、苏联和古巴、几内亚、马里。弃权的是：阿富汗、柬埔寨、多米尼加、埃塞俄比亚、芬兰、加纳、印度、印度尼西亚、伊拉克、约旦、黎巴嫩、利比里亚、利比亚、摩洛哥、尼日利亚、沙特阿拉伯、塞内加尔、索马里亚、多哥、突尼斯、阿拉伯联合共和国、委内瑞拉、也门、南斯拉夫。追随美国赞成这个提案的是：阿根廷、澳大利亚、奥地利、比利时、玻利维亚、巴西、缅甸、锡兰、喀麦隆、加拿大、中非共和国、乍得、智利、哥伦比亚、刚果（前法属刚果）、哥斯达黎加、塞浦路斯、达荷美、丹麦、厄瓜多尔、萨尔瓦多、马来亚、法国、加蓬、希腊、危地马拉、海地、洪都拉斯、冰岛、伊朗、爱尔兰、以色列、意大利、象牙海岸、日本、老挝、卢森堡、马达加斯加、墨西哥、尼泊尔、荷兰、新西兰、尼加拉瓜、尼日尔、挪威、巴基斯坦、巴拿马、巴拉圭、秘鲁、菲律宾、葡萄牙、西班牙、苏丹、瑞典、泰国、土耳其、南非、英国、美国、上沃尔特、乌拉圭、蒋介石分子。
    接着，大会以十三票对五十四票、三十一票弃权否决了苏联建议在大会全体会议上讨论裁军问题的提案。投票赞成苏联提案的是社会主义国家的代表、和古巴、阿富汗、几内亚、马里的代表。
    表决后，赫鲁晓夫快步走出大会会场，把所有向他提问题的记者撇在一边。当赫鲁晓夫回到苏联代表团办公处时，他对西方记者说，“你们可以祝贺帝国主义国家，它们可以庆祝‘胜利’，它们破坏了在联大全体会议上讨论裁军问题，并使世界接近了灾难。这是战争势力的胜利，而不是和平势力的胜利。每个诚实的人将对这个决定感到伤心。看样子，美国、英国、法国和加拿大不愿意裁军，而其他国家还不了解解决这个问题的必要性。但是，我们将不惜一切力量为和平而斗争和揭露战争贩子。”
    赫鲁晓夫又说，“显然我们现在将不得不在制造武器方面进行竞赛。”
    西方记者问他“是否仍然看到希望的光芒”，赫鲁晓夫回答说，“在本届联大会议上——没有希望。”赫鲁晓夫指出，“如果各国人民高声疾呼，并迫使政府不是在口头上，而是在实际行动上同意裁军，那么就不会有战争。没有各国人民的压力，西方政府是不会同意裁军的。”
