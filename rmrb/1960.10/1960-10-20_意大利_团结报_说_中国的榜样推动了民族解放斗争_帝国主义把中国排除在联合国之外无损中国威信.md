The Italian Communist Party's "Unità" published an editorial on the 1st, stating that the world has undergone enormous changes due to the victory of the Chinese revolution eleven years ago. China began to enter a new era, a new balance of power appeared in the world, and the political face of our planet has changed.

The editorial said that China's example has powerfully promoted national liberation struggles around the world. The colonial system has already disintegrated. Imperialism can no longer ignore the reality: the socialist country it has faced for eleven years is unconquerable.

The editorial said that the Chinese people have achieved great success, and China has become a great power with unlimited prestige. U.S. imperialism tried to extinguish the Chinese revolution, but it was completely defeated in Korea. U.S. imperialism continues to carry out aggression and militarily occupies Taiwan, but China is still moving forward. Imperialism is trying to exclude China from the United Nations, which is a shameful, absurd, and hopeless policy that damages the prestige of the United Nations, while China's prestige remains unaffected. The newspaper finally called for the recognition of the People's Republic of China.

    意大利“团结报”说
    中国的榜样推动了民族解放斗争
    帝国主义把中国排除在联合国之外无损中国威信
    意大利共产党的“团结报”1日发表社论说，由于十一年前中国革命的胜利，世界发生了巨大变化。中国开始进入一个新时期，世界出现了新的力量对比，我们星球上的政治面貌起了变化。
    社论说，中国的榜样有力地推动了世界各地的民族解放斗争。殖民主义制度已经分崩离析。帝国主义再也不能无视现实：十一年来它所面临的这个社会主义国家是不可征服的。
    社论说，中国人民取得了巨大成就，中国已经成为具有无限威信的大国。美帝国主义曾试图扑灭中国的革命，但是它在朝鲜被彻底打垮了。美帝国主义还在继续进行侵略，对台湾实行军事占领，但是中国仍在向前迈进。帝国主义力图把中国排除在联合国之外，这是一种有损联合国的威信的可耻、荒谬和毫无希望的政策，而中国的威信却未受损害。报纸最后要求承认中华人民共和国。
