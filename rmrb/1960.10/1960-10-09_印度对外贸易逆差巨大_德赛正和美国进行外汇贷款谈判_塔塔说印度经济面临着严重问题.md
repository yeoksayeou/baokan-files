Xinhua News Agency, 8th - New Delhi Dispatch: New Delhi newspapers recently cited figures released by India's Bureau of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, stating that in the first eight months of 1960, India's foreign trade deficit reached 2.3069 billion rupees. The total value of imports for the eight months reached 6.9573 billion rupees, while exports were only 4.6504 billion rupees.

It is reported that India's total foreign trade deficit for the entire year of 1959 was 2.64 billion rupees.

At the same time, India's sterling balances (foreign exchange reserves) are also constantly decreasing. The "Times of India" reported on October 2nd that sterling balances had decreased from 2.0781 billion rupees in January of this year to 1.4665 billion rupees on September 16th. According to an official spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, sterling balances continued to decrease by 30 million rupees in the past two weeks.

Newspapers say that due to the continuous reduction in foreign exchange reserves, the Indian government announced on October 1st a decision to reduce a large number of imports, including consumer and industrial goods.

According to a report in the "Indian Express" on October 3rd, further reductions in the import volume of twenty kinds of goods will be announced later. The newspaper pointed out that this measure will obviously be considered for implementation after the loan negotiations currently underway in Washington yield results.

Indian Finance Minister Desai is currently in Washington negotiating foreign exchange loans with the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th - New Delhi Dispatch: According to a report in the "Times of India," J.R.D. Tata, Chairman of Tata Iron and Steel Company, said in Bombay on the 6th that the purchasing power of the Indian rupee has fallen by about 35% in the past five years.

Speaking at the 53rd Annual General Meeting of Tata Iron and Steel Company, Tata said that one of the most serious economic obstacles facing India today is the problem of inflation, which is "perhaps the most dangerous and most difficult of all problems."

Tata believes that another serious problem facing India today is the foreign exchange problem, "which has reached another crisis even more serious than what we encountered in 1957."

Tata said, "The severity of the foreign exchange situation can be judged from the following fact: apart from a dangerously small number of balances, we have used up all the foreign exchange we have accumulated in the past, and our current trade balance has an annual deficit. We need another 21 billion rupees in foreign exchange to import equipment for development during the Third Plan period. In the same period, we must repay 6 billion rupees in foreign debt, including interest. Therefore, it is very clear that unless large amounts of foreign aid loans or investments arrive, this plan must inevitably be cut back, and even our current industrial productivity may be endangered."

Tata continued, "These terrifying figures strikingly illustrate the consequences of our failure to achieve self-sufficiency in food." He pointed out that since January 1, 1948, India has spent 10 billion rupees in foreign exchange on importing food.

Tata said that until today, "India seems to be still far from being self-sufficient in food."

    印度对外贸易逆差巨大
    德赛正和美国进行外汇贷款谈判
    塔塔说印度经济面临着严重问题
    新华社8日讯　新德里消息：新德里报纸最近引用印度商业情报和统计局发表的数字说，在1960年的头八个月中，印度对外贸易的逆差达二十三亿零六百九十万卢比。八个月的进口总值达六十九亿五千七百三十万卢比，而出口却只有四十六亿五千零四十万卢比。
    据报道，1959年印度全年对外贸易的逆差是二十六亿四千万卢比。
    同时，印度的英镑余额（外汇储备）也在不断减少。“印度时报”2日报道，英镑余额从今年1月的二十亿七千八百十万卢比减少到9月16日的十四亿六千五百万卢比。据工商部官方发言人透露，在最近两个星期中英镑余额继续减少了三千万卢比。
    报纸说，由于外汇储备在不断减少，印度政府于10月1日宣布决定减少大批进口货物，其中包括消费品和工业品。
    据“印度快报”3日报道，以后还将宣布减少二十种货物的进口量。这家报纸指出，这项措施显然要等到目前正在华盛顿进行的贷款谈判取得何种结果以后再考虑实行。
    印度财政部长德赛目前正在华盛顿和美国进行外汇贷款谈判。
    新华社8日讯　新德里消息：据“印度时报”报道，塔塔钢铁公司董事长杰·鲁·德·塔塔6日在孟买说，印度卢比的购买力在过去五年内就下降了35％左右。
    塔塔在塔塔钢铁公司第五十三次年度股东大会上讲话时说，印度今天面临的最严重的经济障碍之一是通货膨胀问题，这个问题“也许是一切问题中最危险的、最难办的问题。”
    塔塔认为，印度今天另一个严重问题是外汇问题，“这个问题已经达到了甚至比我们在1957年所遇到的更为严重的另一个危机”。
    塔塔说，“外汇情况的严重性可以从下列事实来加以判断：除了为数少得危险的一些结余外，我们已经用光了我们过去所积累的全部外汇，我们的目前的贸易收支情况有年度逆差。我们还需要两百十亿卢比的外汇来进口第三个计划期间用于发展的设备。在同一个时期，连同利息在内，我们必须偿还六十亿卢比的外债。因此十分明显，除非外援贷款或投资大量地来到，这个计划不可避免地必须加以削减，甚至目前我们的工业生产率也可能遭到危险。”
    塔塔继续说，“这些可怕的数字突出地说明了我们在粮食方面没有能够实现自给的后果。”他指出，自从1948年1月1日以来，印度在进口粮食方面用去了一百亿卢比的外汇。
    塔塔说，直到今天为止，“印度在粮食方面离开自给自足似乎还远得很”。
