We believe that the fascist atrocities cannot intimidate the heroic Japanese people, and they will continue to wage a heroic and unremitting struggle against US imperialism and its agents. The Chinese people and peace-loving people of all countries resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people. Final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people."

"Mr. Asanuma has made great contributions in leading the Socialist Party in the struggle against the Japan-US military alliance treaty, for Japan's independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and in promoting friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people.

"I am extremely indignant at the US-Japan reactionaries' connivance with thugs in carrying out this despicable assassination. Although they assassinated Mr. Asanuma, they can never stop the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people. This shameless act can only arouse greater anger among the Japanese people against the US-Japan reactionaries and prompt the Japanese people to wage a more resolute struggle."

Xinhua News Agency, 13th -- Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and Vice-Chairmen Lei Renmin and Ji Chaoding sent a telegram to the Japan Socialist Party headquarters on the 12th, offering condolences on the unfortunate death of Inejiro Asanuma due to assassination.

"During his lifetime, Mr. Asanuma made great contributions to opposing the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people – US imperialism, opposing the US-Japan military alliance treaty, striving for Japan's independence and autonomy, and promoting friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people. We firmly believe that although Mr. Asanuma has passed away, the heroic Japanese people will surely fight even more for Japan's peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality, and ultimately achieve final victory.

He made important contributions to promoting friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. Mr. Asanuma's murder further proves that the US-Japan reactionaries are the mortal enemies of the Japanese people and women. This despicable fascist atrocity can only arouse the anger of the Japanese people and women, make the Japanese people more clearly recognize the hideous face of US imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, further strengthen unity, and resolutely fight to the end to defeat US imperialism and its running dogs."

We firmly believe that the atrocities of the US-Japan reactionaries can only arouse the vast number of Japanese people and youth to further strengthen unity, to launch a more powerful struggle against US imperialism, against Japanese militarism, and for Japan's independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality. Victory will surely belong to the Japanese people."
