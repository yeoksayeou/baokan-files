　　Seeing Far, Grasping Early
　　Yang Qi

    Whether one is good at chess depends fundamentally on how many moves one can foresee. Being able to see one more move ahead provides one more point of initiative.

    This is true for everything under the sky. Nothing exists in isolation or stagnation; everything is connected to and constantly evolving with other things. Those who are good at getting things done are inevitably good at understanding how various things "connect" and "change." This connects to that, and that connects to something else. That changes into this, and this changes into something else. Countless threads, endless transformations. These are by no means chaotic or arbitrary; their "connections" and "changes" all have "rules to follow." However, it is definitely not a case of "everything being predetermined by fate." As long as we grasp the "rules to follow," and see clearly how things "connect" and "change" up and down, before and after, we can control our destiny with our own hands.

    "Sanqiu" (Three Autumns), the period encompassing autumn harvesting, sowing, and plowing, is the busiest time of year for agricultural production, truly involving a myriad of tasks. However, this year's "Sanqiu" work in Zuo Gou Brigade of Bei Wu Du Commune in Wuyang County, Henan, doesn't seem particularly "tense," neither crowded nor hectic. Is it because their workload is lighter? No. Their autumn harvest this year, like elsewhere, involves a large area and many late-maturing crops; moreover, they have a large quantity of sweet potatoes, which are more labor-intensive to store. In previous years, when the autumn harvest tasks were not so large, they were still extremely busy; this year, however, they are handling it calmly, systematically, and efficiently. What's the secret? It lies in the fact that the leading cadres of this brigade adopted a leadership method of "seeing a few more moves ahead" this year. As early as during the summer planting season, they analyzed the potential changes in the autumn production situation, studied the connections between production activities from planting to management to harvesting and even the next season's sowing, and rationally arranged the various summer crops according to their different growth periods. This staggered the timing of various agricultural activities, allowing for both careful management and meticulous harvesting, while also facilitating careful and detailed autumn planting. Before the "Sanqiu" work began, they again analyzed and studied the relationship between autumn harvesting and sowing, winter and spring wheat field management, and next year's summer harvesting and planting, so that autumn planting could be suitable for the stubble from autumn harvesting and also facilitate the arrangement of work for this winter, next spring, and next summer. It can be predicted that their work next year will continue to be proactive at every step.

    The overall situation of the production and life of any production team or small team is far more complex than a game of chess. Sorting out the main threads from this myriad of tasks is not enough with just one person or a few people. Only under the leadership of the Party, by concentrating the wisdom of the masses, can we have the most powerful "wise eyes," seeing deeply, seeing far, seeing clearly, so that the road becomes wider and wider, and we become more and more proactive.

    看得远，抓得早

    下棋高明不高明，根本之点就在于能看几步棋。能多看一步，就多一分主动权。
    天底下的事情都是这样。每一件事情都不是孤立的、静止的，都同别的事情有连带关系，都在不断地发展变化。善于办事的人，必然善于了解各种各样的事情怎样“连”，怎样“变”。这个连着那个，那个又连着另一个。那样变成这样，这样又变成另一样。千丝万缕，千变万化。这些，决不是乱七八糟的，随心所欲的，它们之“连”之“变”都有“一定之规”。可是，也决不是“万事由天定”。只要拿准了“一定之规”，看准了上上下下前前后后怎样“连”、怎样“变”，我们就能用自己的双手掌定乾坤。
    “三秋”，是一年当中农业生产顶忙的时候，真是千头万绪。河南舞阳县北舞渡公社左沟大队，今年的“三秋”工作看起来却并不特别“紧张”，既不拥挤，又不忙乱。是不是他们的工作任务比较轻呢？不是的。他们今年的秋收，同别的地方一样，面积大，晚秋多；而且收藏起来比较费工的甘薯多。往年，秋收任务没有这样大，还忙得不得了；今年，却是从容不迫，有条有紊，干得又多又好。妙在何处？就在于这个大队的领导干部今年采取了“多看几步棋”的领导方法。早在夏种的时候，他们就分析了今年秋季生产形势可能发生的变化，研究了从种到管到收以至下一季播种等生产活动之间的连带关系，把夏种的各种作物按生长期的不同作了合理的搭配。这样，各项农事活动的时间错开了，既能精管细理，又能精打细收，还便于秋种精耕细作。“三秋”工作开始以前，他们就又分析研究了秋收秋种、冬春麦田管理、明年夏收夏种之间的关系，使秋种既能适合秋收的茬口，又便于安排今冬、明春、明夏的工作。可以预料，他们明年的工作仍然会步步主动。
    任何一个生产队、一个小队的生产、生活的全局，都要比一盘象棋复杂得多。在这千头万绪之中理出主要的头绪来，光凭一个人或少数人是不够的。只有在党的领导下，把群众的智慧集中起来，就成为最有力的“慧眼”，看得深，看得远，看得透，越走路越宽，越走越主动。
