    Premier Castro said in a television address:
    The Havana Declaration is a program for a new stage of the Cuban Revolution
    The current tasks are to realize industrialization, advance land reform, develop education, and increase production
    We must continue to defeat counter-revolutionary forces and oppose the US imperialist invasion conspiracy
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 15th - Cuban Premier Castro announced in a television address tonight that the Cuban revolution has ended its first stage with the promulgation of laws nationalizing large enterprises and Cuba's private banks, and the urban reform law, and has begun a new stage.
    The Premier emphasized that the program for the first stage of the Cuban revolution was the program put forward during the attack on the Moncada Barracks on July 26, 1953, which was later expanded and improved in many aspects. The program for the new stage that is now beginning is the Havana Declaration, passed by the Cuban people at the Cuban National People's Congress, which integrates their aspirations.
    Castro pointed out that the Cuban revolution faces the long-term tasks of industrialization, advancing land reform, people's education, increasing production, and eliminating the unemployment left over from the tyranny. The revolutionary government already possesses the necessary resources for this, including basic industries, transportation, public utilities, foreign trade, banking and credit, and large stores. In addition, it has the assistance of socialist countries and the friendship of neutralist countries to overcome the economic resistance of imperialism.
    Castro emphasized that the Cuban revolution also has the task of defeating counter-revolutionary forces and defeating counter-revolutionary rebellions and invasion conspiracies led and funded by US imperialism. He emphasized that the revolution will surely win in this new stage as well.
    Castro pointed out that the measures taken in the first stage of the Cuban revolution had to be drastic, because one cannot shuffle one's feet in the face of imperialist monopoly groups and large estate owners. The economic and political power of a minority of privileged people must be deprived, and this power has already been deprived. In the new stage, harsh measures will only be used against counter-revolutionaries and foreign agents who conspire against the interests of the state.
    Castro said that the Cuban revolutionary government plans to continue to implement the policy of takeover and nationalization continuously, but will not touch the interests of honest people. He made assurances and offered ways for small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists to continue their activities on behalf of the revolutionary government, and announced that the revolutionary government, after nationalizing the banks, is now and will be able to provide loans to small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists, and will help them. He called on all those who participated in the struggle in the first stage to invest in the revolution, work hard with the people, and struggle together to develop the national economy.
    When Castro delivered this television address, Cuban President Dorticós, Guinean President Sékou Touré, who is visiting Cuba, as well as members of the Cuban cabinet and President Touré's entourage also appeared on the television program.
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 15th - The Cuban cabinet meeting passed two laws this morning: the urban reform law and the law on the use of estates for recreation and uninhabited courtyards.
    The first law stipulates that everyone has the right to obtain housing and provides methods to achieve this goal.

    卡斯特罗总理在电视讲话中说
    哈瓦那宣言是古巴革命新阶段的纲领
    当前任务是实现工业化、推进土改、发展教育、增加生产
    必须继续击溃反革命势力并反对美帝国主义的入侵阴谋
    新华社哈瓦那15日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗今天晚间在电视讲话中宣布，古巴革命以颁布把大企业和古巴的私营银行收归国有的法律和城市改革法结束了它的第一阶段，并且开始了新的阶段。
    这位总理强调指出，古巴革命第一阶段的纲领是在1953年7月26日袭击蒙卡达兵营时提出的纲领，后来这个纲领在许多方面得到扩大和改善。现在开始的新阶段的纲领是古巴人民在古巴全国人民大会上通过的综合了他们愿望的哈瓦那宣言。
    卡斯特罗指出，古巴革命面临着工业化、推进土地改革、人民教育、增加生产和消灭暴政遗留下来的失业现象的长期任务。革命政府已经为此拥有必要的资源，拥有基础工业、运输业、公用事业、对外贸易、银行和信贷以及大商店。此外，还拥有社会主义国家的援助和中立主义国家的友谊来战胜帝国主义的经济抵制。
    卡斯特罗强调说，古巴革命还有击溃反革命势力以及击溃由美帝国主义领导和资助的反革命叛乱和入侵阴谋的任务。他强调指出，革命在这个新的阶段中也必将获胜。
    卡斯特罗指出，古巴革命第一阶段中采取的措施必须是激烈的，因为在帝国主义垄断集团和大庄园主面前不能踱方步。必须剥夺少数特权者的经济和政治权力，这种权力已经被剥夺了。在新阶段里，只有对阴谋反对国家利益的反革命分子和外国代理人才采用严厉的手段。
    卡斯特罗说，古巴革命政府计划继续不断地执行接管和国有化的政策，但是将不触及诚实人的利益。他代表革命政府向中小商人和工业家提出了保证和继续开展他们的活动的办法，他宣布，革命政府在把银行收归国有后，现在和将来都能够向中小商人和工业家提供贷款，并且将帮助他们。他号召所有参加过第一阶段的斗争的人们投入革命，同人民一起努力奋斗，为发展国民经济而共同斗争。
    在卡斯特罗发表这项电视演说的时候，古巴总统多尔蒂科斯、正在古巴访问的几内亚总统塞古·杜尔以及古巴内阁成员和杜尔总统的随行人员也在这次电视节目中出现。
    新华社哈瓦那15日电　古巴内阁会议今天清晨通过了两项法律：城市改革法以及关于使用供休憩用的庄园和无人居住的庭院的法律。
    第一项法律规定人人都有取得住房的权利，并提供达到这个目的的方法。
