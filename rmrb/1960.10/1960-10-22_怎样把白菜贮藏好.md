This year, the planting area of Chinese cabbage is large, which provides a solid material foundation for the supply of vegetables in this winter and next spring, and also brings extremely arduous tasks for harvesting, transportation, processing, and storage. The current issue is: on the basis of strengthening the later-stage management of Chinese cabbage to strive for high yield and more harvest, continue our efforts to store Chinese cabbage well.

The Storage Characteristics of Chinese Cabbage

Chinese cabbage is still a living organism after harvest. Throughout the entire storage process, on the one hand, it continues to carry out life activities centered on respiration, constantly consuming the nutrients stored in itself; on the other hand, it faces the invasion and threat of microorganisms at any time and from any place, thus causing changes and losses such as leaf separation, decay, cracking, and water loss of Chinese cabbage during storage. These losses are related to the inherent storage characteristics of Chinese cabbage on the one hand, and are closely related to external environmental conditions on the other. The storage methods and storage management technical measures we adopt must meet the storage characteristics and requirements of Chinese cabbage in order to obtain good storage results.

There are many varieties of Chinese cabbage, and their differences in storage resistance are very large. Selecting storage-resistant varieties is a prerequisite for ensuring long-term storage, and varieties that are not storage-resistant are only suitable for short-term storage or early consumption.

The storage effect of Chinese cabbage is also affected by external factors such as whether the Chinese cabbage is damaged and the temperature and humidity conditions during storage. Damage opens the door for bacteria to invade, increasing the chance of decay. Too low humidity is an important reason for water loss in Chinese cabbage, but high humidity is prone to cause decay, so it is required to maintain appropriate humidity. When the cabbage is first put into the cellar, the humidity should be low (60-70%) due to the high temperature; when the cabbage temperature has dropped, the humidity should be increased (80-90%). Among the external factors, the control of temperature is the most important. Too high storage temperature will cause losses such as leaf separation, decay, and cracking. However, too low temperature will also cause the Chinese cabbage to freeze. In the case of slight and short-term freezing of Chinese cabbage, only the cabbage leaves appear slightly stiff. After slow thawing, it can restore its life functions and maintain fresh quality. If the Chinese cabbage is severely frozen, the cabbage stalks will appear raised and swollen. After thawing, it will be difficult to restore to its original shape and will quickly cause decay.

It can be seen that the storage characteristics of Chinese cabbage are mainly manifested as liking coolness, fearing heat, and fearing freezing. According to the storage experience of farmers over the years, the most suitable storage temperature for Chinese cabbage is around 0 degrees Celsius, preferably not lower than minus 1 degree and not higher than plus 2 degrees.

Storage Methods Suitable for the Masses

Since this year's autumn vegetable production has formed a large-scale mass movement, what follows is bound to be an equally scaled mass vegetable storage movement. Based on the experience of mass storage of Chinese cabbage in previous years, especially last year, and the characteristics of this year, we introduce the following storage methods that are labor-saving, material-saving, simple, easy to implement, and suitable for the masses.

Burial Method - Dead Cellar Storage

The burial method is the general so-called dead cellar storage. Its advantages are simple structure, no cellar materials, no management required, and the quality of the vegetables is fresh. It is a good way to save labor and materials. However, the storage period of dead cellar storage is generally shorter than that of live cellars, and it cannot be seen after burial. If the technology is not well mastered, the loss will be greater, so many people still have concerns about it. In fact, the burial technology is not difficult to master, and if stored well, the storage loss is less than that of live cellars, and the quality of the vegetables is fresh. Therefore, dead cellars and live cellars can complement each other by learning from each other's strengths.

The technical points of Chinese cabbage burial are: 1. Select a location with high and dry terrain and sandy soil, dig the cellar early, and let the sun fully shine to promote dryness inside the cellar to facilitate storage. If the land is wet and there is a lot of water, Chinese cabbage is prone to grow new roots and crack after burial, and excessive humidity can easily cause decay. The specifications of the cellar should be adapted to local conditions, and the direction should be north-south long. 2. Harvest in time and fully dry the vegetables. In this way, the outer leaves of Chinese cabbage appear soft and not easily damaged, and the humidity will not be too high after entering the cellar, which can reduce decay. 3. Seize the opportunity and enter the cellar at the right time. Because Chinese cabbage cannot be ventilated after burial, the grasp of the time of entering the cellar is particularly strict. It must seize the opportunity and be carried out when the ground begins to freeze, with the principle that the Chinese cabbage will not be heated after entering the cellar and covering the soil. This is very important and is an important key to burial technology. When entering the cellar, it is best to stand upright in the cellar with the roots facing down, one plant close to another. The vegetables should be squeezed tightly, but do not squeeze them. Frozen vegetables cannot enter the cellar, because frozen vegetables are most prone to decay once thawed after burial. 4. Master the covering of soil according to requirements. After the Chinese cabbage enters the cellar, dig up the soil next to the cellar to cover it. It can be covered all at once or in several times. In order to avoid the Chinese cabbage from being heated, it is more reasonable to cover the soil in several times. The thickness of the soil covering should be based on the thickness of the local frozen soil layer and the nature of the soil. For dry sandy soil with a thin frozen layer, the soil covering should be slightly thinner; for low-lying clay soil with a thick frozen layer, the soil covering should also be slightly thicker. The thickness of the soil covering should be marked by the buried Chinese cabbage not freezing or only the tips of the vegetables being slightly frozen. This is also an important key to burial technology. 5. Strengthen inspection and deal with it early if serious heat decay is found. The method of inspection is to dig a hole from the top of the cellar and take out the vegetables to see. If it is found that many white roots have grown on the vegetable plants, the vegetable leaves are yellow and attached with water droplets, and the vegetable stalks are sticky, it is a sign of excessive heat and humidity; if the vegetable plants are frozen, it is because the temperature is too low.

The use of the burial method is limited by regional climatic conditions. It can be used in areas south of Shenyang, and is especially suitable for areas such as Hebei, southern Liaoning, Shanxi, and northern Shaanxi. Under the climatic conditions of Beijing, Dalian and other regions, it can generally be stored until after the Spring Festival.

Five Simple Storage Methods

Simple storage methods generally have the characteristics of saving labor and materials, and being simple and easy to implement.

1. Indoor Storage Method. All collective units such as government agencies, organizations, factories, enterprises, schools, and troops, as well as urban and rural residents, can use cool empty rooms and corners, as well as basements, corridors, etc. to store vegetables in the absence of open space and cellar wood and cellar materials.

The technical requirements for indoor storage are basically the same as those for live cellar storage. Special attention should be paid to the fact that the insulation of general empty rooms is poor. In the cold winter, we must do a good job in cold protection and insulation to prevent the Chinese cabbage from freezing; when storing in a room near a stove or heating equipment, we must do a good job in heat prevention and fully keep the vegetables cool.

When storing and stacking vegetables, materials such as sorghum stalks, bamboo poles, and sunflower stalks should be used to lift the vegetables up, so that the vegetables do not touch the ground, and there are gaps between the vegetables, so that air can circulate smoothly, and the Chinese cabbage is not easy to heat up.

2. Heeling-in Storage Method, also known as Storing in mounds method. When harvesting Chinese cabbage, pull it up with its roots, tear off rotten yellow cabbage leaves, and mound one plant close to another in a ditch dug in advance. When mounding, cover the roots with soil, and water appropriately after mounding, then cover with cattail mats or straw curtains. Roll up the mats in warm weather to ventilate and cool down, and cover the mats in cold weather to protect against the cold. This method is especially suitable for vegetables that do not have a core or have a loose core. After storage, the Chinese cabbage can still grow a core, which not only increases the weight, but also improves the quality.

3. Open-air Stacking Method. Stack the dried vegetables in an orderly manner on the south side of a windbreak or wall, and cover with cattail mats or straw curtains. In the early stage when the temperature is high, frequently lift the mats to ventilate and cool down, and turn the stacks to prevent the Chinese cabbage from heating up; in the later stage when the temperature is low, do a good job in cold protection, and cover with double mats when necessary.

4. Topless Cellar Storage Method. The method is similar to that of general live cellars, except that the cellar is narrower and the top of the cellar is not sheltered. Only a small amount of wooden poles or bamboo poles need to be placed horizontally on the cellar wall, and then covered with cattail mats and straw curtains, which can save a lot of cellar construction materials and soil for the roof. The technical requirements for storage management such as ventilation and turning the vegetables are the same as those for live cellar storage.

5. Freeze Storage Method. Stack the Chinese cabbage in a shady and cool place, so that the vegetables freeze naturally. Take it as you use it, and it can be stored until the weather turns warm and the vegetables are about to thaw. During storage, it must be ensured that the Chinese cabbage will not thaw once frozen. Freezing and thawing is most likely to cause decay. When eating, you must also cut it while frozen and cook it immediately.

Live Cellar Storage is the Main Method

Cellar storage not only stores a large quantity and has a long storage time, but also the masses have the habit and experience of cellar storage. It is the main storage method commonly used in various places, accounting for the largest proportion of storage.

Because the amount of Chinese cabbage stored this year has increased a lot, some new vegetable cellars must be built accordingly. When building cellars, substitutes should be used to reduce or eliminate the use of wood. Tianjin used reed bundles instead of wood to build wooden arch vegetable cellars, and Tangshan, Shenyang, Jinzhou and other places used sorghum stalks instead of wood as cellar beams and cellar pillars, which are all good experiences. The cellar site should be selected nearby to save transportation labor and transportation losses. The cellar should be dug early to make the cellar dry to facilitate firmness and storage. The form of the cellar should be adapted to local conditions. In most parts of North China, semi-underground type is suitable; in Northeast and Northwest areas where it is colder, it is better to go completely underground. If it is necessary to dig a cellar in a place with a high groundwater level, the cellar can be slightly shallower, but the cellar wall should be raised and thickened, and the length and width of the cellar are not limited. The direction of the cellar should be north-south long. Vegetable cellars should have sufficient ventilation facilities (skylights, cellar eyes, etc.) to facilitate cooling and dehumidification; but in the cold season, attention should be paid to preventing freezing.

Preparations should be made before entering the cellar. Pay attention to the weather and harvest in time. After harvesting, dry the vegetables for a few days. After the vegetable leaves appear soft, tear off the rotten yellow leaves, and stack them next to the cellar to wait for entering the cellar. Entering the cellar depends on the weather. If you enter the cellar too early, the Chinese cabbage will easily get hot; if you enter the cellar too late, the vegetables will easily freeze. The method of stacking vegetables should be improved. The general method of stacking vegetables in cellar storage is that the stacking is tight, the ventilation is poor, and the temperature of the vegetable pile is high. Frequent turning of the vegetables and ventilation management are required. In this way, labor and time are not economical. In recent years, some areas have promoted the method of stacking vegetables on shelves and elevating them. After the vegetables are stacked in the air, there are gaps between the vegetables, and the ventilation is good. The vegetable temperature at different levels is stable and consistent, so the storage loss is small; and it can reduce the number of vegetable turnovers, simplify the ventilation management, and greatly save management labor.

Storage management work has different requirements according to the climate change law of the storage season. Storage management can be divided into three periods: good ventilation in the early stage, good insulation in the middle stage, and good heat prevention in the later stage. In addition, attention should be paid to the cleanliness of the cellar, timely removal of rotten leaves, and timely treatment of vegetables that are diseased and cracked and are not suitable for continued storage.

    怎样把白菜贮藏好
    北京农业大学园艺系　果蔬贮藏加工教研组
    今年白菜种植面积大，它给今冬明春的蔬菜供应提供了雄厚的物质基础，也给收获、运输、加工、贮藏带来极其艰巨的任务。当前的问题是：在加强白菜后期管理，争取高产多收的基础上，再接再厉，把白菜贮藏好。
    白菜贮藏的特性
    白菜在收获后仍然是有生命的活体。在整个的贮藏过程中，它一方面继续进行着以呼吸作用为中心的生命活动，不断消耗其本身所储存的营养物质；另一方面随时随地面临着微生物的侵染和威胁，从而使白菜在贮藏中发生脱帮、腐烂、裂球、失水等等的变化和损失。这些损失，一方面与白菜内在的贮藏特性有关；另一方面又与外界的环境条件有着密不可分的联系。我们采用的贮藏方法和贮藏管理技术措施，都要符合白菜的贮藏特性和要求，才能够获得良好的贮藏效果。
    白菜的品种很多，它们之间耐藏性的差异很大。选用耐藏的品种是保证长期贮藏的先决条件，不耐贮藏的品种只宜作短期贮藏或早期食用。
    白菜贮藏的效果还受白菜是否损伤以及贮藏中的温度和湿度条件等等外界因素的影响。有了损伤就为病菌开放侵入的门户，增加腐烂的机会。湿度过低是白菜失水的重要原因，但湿度高又易引起腐烂，因此要求维持适宜的湿度。菜刚入窖，因温度较高，湿度宜低（60—70％）；在菜温已经下降，则湿度宜提高（80—90％）。在外界的因素中，以温度的掌握最关重要。贮藏温度过高，会发生脱帮、腐烂、裂球等等损失。但温度过低，也会使白菜受冻结冰。在白菜轻度和短时间冻结的情况下，仅菜叶稍显僵硬，经过缓慢解冻，能够恢复其生活机能，保持新鲜品质。如果白菜受冻程度严重，菜帮出现隆起肿泡，解冻后便难恢复原状，而且迅速引起腐烂。
    由此可见，白菜的贮藏特性最主要表现为喜凉，怕热，又怕冻。根据农民多年的贮藏经验，白菜最适宜的贮藏温度是摄氏零度左右，最好不低于零下一度，不高于零上两度。
    适应群众性的贮菜方法
    由于今年的秋菜生产已经形成大规模的群众运动，伴随而来的必然是一个同具规模的群众性贮菜运动。根据往年特别是去年群众贮藏白菜的经验和今年的特点，我们介绍以下几种省工省料，简单易行，适合于群众采用的贮藏方法。
    埋藏法——死窖贮藏
    埋藏法即一般所谓的死窖贮藏。它的优点是构造简单，不用窖材，不需管理，而且菜的质量新鲜，是省工省料的好办法。但死窖贮藏的期限一般比活窖短，而且埋藏后眼不能见，如果技术掌握不好，损失较大，因此不少人对它还有顾虑。其实埋藏的技术并不难掌握，而且贮藏好了，贮藏的损耗比活窖少，菜的质量新鲜。因此死窖与活窖正可以取长补短，配合采用。
    白菜埋藏的技术要点是：1、选地势高燥和沙性土壤的地点，提早挖窖，让阳光充分照晒，促使窖内干燥，以利贮藏。地湿水多，白菜埋藏后易长新根发生裂球，而且湿度过大容易引起腐烂。窖的规格要因地制宜，方向宜南北长。2、及时收获，充分晒菜。这样白菜外叶显得皮软不易损伤，而且入窖后不致湿度过大，可以减少腐烂。3、抓住时机，适时入窖。因为白菜埋藏后不能进行通风换气，入窖时间的掌握要求特别严格，必须抓住时机，在地表开始冻结时进行，以白菜入窖复土后不致受热为原则。这点非常重要，是埋藏技术的重要关键。入窖时，以根部朝下，一棵紧挨一棵立在窖内为好。菜要挤紧，但不要挤伤。冻菜不能入窖，因冻菜埋藏后一经解冻最易腐烂。4、根据要求，掌握复土。白菜入窖后挖取窖旁的土进行覆盖，一次复完或分次进行都可以。为了避免白菜受热，分次复土比较合理。复土厚度要以当地冻土层厚度和土壤性质为依据。干燥砂土，冻结层薄，复土宜稍薄；低潮粘土，冻结层厚，复土也宜稍厚。复土厚薄要以埋藏的白菜不冻或仅菜梢微冻为标志，这也是埋藏技术的重要关键。5、加强检查，发现有严重受热腐烂时提早处理。检查的方法，可以从窖顶掏一窟窿，取出菜来看，如果发现菜棵长出许多白根，菜叶发黄并附有水珠，菜帮发粘，是受热和湿度过大的表现；如菜棵受冻，则是温度过低的缘故。
    埋藏法的采用多少受到地区气候条件的限制，在沈阳以南的地区都可采用，而以河北、辽南、山西、陕北等地区尤为合适。在北京、旅大等地区的气候条件下，一般可贮藏至春节以后。
    五种简易贮藏法
    简易贮藏法一般都具有省工省料而且简便易行的特点。
    1、室内贮藏法。所有机关、团体、工厂、企业、学校、部队等集体单位和城乡居民，在没有空地而窖木窖材又缺的情况下，只要有冷凉空房和角落，以及地下室、楼道等等，都可用来贮藏。
    有关室内贮藏的技术要求与活窖贮藏基本一致。要特别注意的是一般空房的绝缘地力差，在严寒的冬季要做好防寒保温的工作，不使白菜受冻；在生有火炉或暖气设备近处的室内贮藏时，要做好防热工作，充分保持菜的冷凉。
    在贮藏码菜时，应利用秫秸、竹竿、向日葵秆等材料，将菜架空起来，这样菜不着地，菜与菜间又有空隙，空气可以顺畅流通，白菜便不容易发热。
    2、假植贮藏法，又叫囤菜法。收获白菜时连根拔起，撕去烂黄菜叶，一棵紧挨一棵囤在事先挖好的沟里，囤时根部培土，囤后适当灌水，然后盖上蒲席或草帘。天暖卷席通风降温，天冷盖席防寒。这个方法特别适用于不包心或包心不实的菜。经贮藏后，白菜还能长心，不但增加重量，还会改善品质。
    3、露地垛藏法。将晒好的菜有秩序地堆垛在风障或墙壁的南侧，披盖蒲席或草帘即成。前期温度高，要经常掀席通风降温和倒垛，不使白菜受热；后期温度低，要做好防寒工作，必要时盖双席。
    4、无顶窖藏法。做法与一般活窖相似，不同的是窖较窄而且不棚窖顶，只需在窖墙横架少量木杆或竹竿，然后盖上蒲席和草帘，这样可以省去大量的建窖材料和棚顶用土。放风和倒菜等贮藏管理技术要求，与活窖贮藏一样。
    5、冻藏法。将白菜堆于背阴冷凉的地方，令菜自然冻结，随用随取，可一直贮藏至天气转暖菜将解冻时为止。贮藏时要掌握白菜一经冻结便不再解冻，一冻一化，最易引起腐烂。食用时也须乘冻切好立即煮用。
    活窖贮藏是主要方法
    窖藏法不但贮藏数量大，贮藏时间长，而且群众都有窖藏的习惯和经验，是各地普遍采用的主要贮藏方法，在贮藏中所占的比重最大。
    由于今年白菜贮藏数量增加很多，必须相应地新建一些菜窖。在建窖时，应当利用代用品，少用或不用木材。天津市利用芦苇捆把代替木料建成无木拱圆菜窖，唐山、沈阳、锦州等地利用秫秸代替木料作窖梁窖柱，都是很好的经验。窖址应就近选择，可以节省搬运劳力和搬运损失。窖要早挖，使窖干燥以利坚固和贮藏。窖的形式要因地制宜。华北的大部分地区以半地下式为宜；东北、西北较为严寒地区，则宜全部深入地下。必须在地下水位高的地方挖窖，窖可稍浅，但窖墙应加高加厚，窖长和窖宽不拘。窖的方向以南北长为宜。菜窖要开足通风设施（天窗、窖眼等），以利降温降湿；但在严寒季节又要注意防冻。
    入窖前应做好准备。注意天时，及时抢收。收后晒菜几天，在菜叶显得皮软后，撕去烂黄叶片，堆码窖旁等待入窖。入窖要看天时，入窖过早，白菜容易受热；入窖过晚，则菜又易受冻。码菜方法要改进。窖藏中一般的码菜方法，堆积紧密，通风差，菜堆温度高，必须经常进行倒菜和放风管理，这样，人工、时间都不经济。近几年来，有些地区推行了上架和架空的码菜方法。架空码菜后，菜与菜间留出空隙，通风良好，不同层次的菜温稳定一致，因此贮藏损耗较小；而且可以减少倒菜次数，简化放风管理，大大节省管理劳力。
    贮藏管理工作，根据贮藏季节的气候变化规律，有不同的要求。贮藏管理可以分为三个时期，前期要通风好，中期保温好，后期防热好。此外，还要注意窖内清洁，及时清除烂叶，发现有病及裂球等不宜继续贮藏的菜，要及时处理。
