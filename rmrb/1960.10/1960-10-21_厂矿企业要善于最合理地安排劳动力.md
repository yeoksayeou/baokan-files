    Factory and Mining Enterprises Must Be Good at Optimally Arranging Labor Power

    At any time, the issue of labor power is the most important issue in organizing production. Therefore, the leaders of all factory and mining enterprises must be good at optimally arranging and using labor power, doing the most with the least manpower, and ensuring that the existing labor power is utilized to the maximum extent.

    Ensuring that the production front line has sufficient manpower is the primary link in the rational arrangement of labor power. The production front line is the main battlefield where people transform nature. Insufficient manpower allocation will directly affect the improvement of production. Industrial production is an organic whole, and there is a high degree of rigor and continuity between the main and auxiliary processes, and between the first and second lines. In order to ensure the normal progress of production, maintaining a certain number of non-production personnel and auxiliary personnel is entirely necessary; however, the work of auxiliary and management departments should be subordinate to the needs of production and conducive to promoting production. There is a primary and secondary relationship between the first and second lines. If too many non-production personnel are occupied, and it is impossible to ensure that the production front line has sufficient forces, it will not only weaken the production force and directly hinder production, but also cause bloated organizations, personnel waste, reduce overall employee efficiency, and increase the production cost of enterprises. Therefore, at any time, enterprise leaders who command production must pay more attention to the front line, which plays a decisive role in the overall production situation, and when arranging labor power, they must also distinguish between primary and secondary, and first ensure that the front line has a sufficient number of strong labor power.

    While ensuring that the front line has sufficient labor power, we should also adapt to the requirements of continuous leap forward in production, correctly grasp the proportional relationship of high-speed development of production, and rationally arrange and adjust the strength of each production link. Taking the mining industry as an example, tunneling and transportation are two important links, and there is often a situation where the proportion of labor power in these links is relatively low, which is obviously not in line with the requirements of the continuous leap forward of coal and coke and ore. In our blitz of coal and coke and ore production and transportation, we must first gather manpower and strengthen the combat power in these two areas. However, for a region or an enterprise, due to differences in conditions, the weak links may not necessarily be tunneling and transportation, but may also be mining, then the arrangement of labor power should be based on the specific situation at that time and place to make a reasonable deployment. Moreover, we must also see that the contradictions in production are constantly developing and changing. With the improvement of tunneling and transportation equipment, conditions, etc., the imbalance of production technology development between various processes, the old weak links are overcome, and new weak links will inevitably appear, and then the deployment of labor power must be determined according to the new situation. In short, as long as we are good at finding out the correct proportion of labor power distribution in each production link under different times, places, and conditions, according to the law of continuous leap forward, we can make the arrangement of labor power meet the requirements of production and become a guarantee for organizing continuous leap forward.

    To do a good job in rationally arranging labor power, the key lies in whether the leadership has the idea and determination of self-reliance. In order to ensure the implementation of the general policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and steel as the key link, and comprehensively leaping forward, comrades engaged in industry must make the greatest efforts to tap the labor potential from within the enterprise and avoid asking for people from outside as much as possible.

    Rational arrangement of labor power, on the one hand, to find out the proportion that should be maintained under certain conditions between the first and second lines, the main and auxiliary processes, and the various links of production, in accordance with the requirements of high-speed development of production; on the other hand, also according to political ideology, physical strength, technical proficiency and other factors to consider the allocation and use of manpower. From this point of view, the rational arrangement of labor power is also a process of deepening the leadership style and improving the leadership level.

### 厂矿企业要善于最合理地安排劳动力

    厂矿企业要善于最合理地安排劳动力
    任何时候，劳动力的问题都是组织生产的头等重要问题。因此，一切厂矿企业的领导者，都要善于最合理地安排和使用劳动力，以最少的人力办最多的事情，保证最大限度地发挥现有劳动力的作用。
    保证生产第一线有足够的人力，这是合理安排劳动力的首要环节。生产第一线是人们变革自然的主要战场，人力配备不足，就会直接影响到生产的提高。工业生产是个有机的整体，主要工序和辅助工序、一线和二线之间具有高度的严密性和连续性。为了保证生产正常进行，保持一定数量的非生产人员和辅助人员，这是完全必要的；但是辅助部门和管理部门的工作，应该服从于生产的需要，有利于促进生产。一线、二线之间存在着主次的关系，如果非生产人员占用过多，不能保证生产第一线有足够的兵力，不但削弱了生产的力量，直接妨碍生产，还会造成机构臃肿，人员浪费，降低全员工效，增加企业的生产成本。因此无论在任何时候，指挥生产的企业领导者，都要把自己的注意力更多地放在对整个生产全局起决定作用的第一线，在安排劳动力时，也必须分清主次，首先保证第一线有足够数量的精壮劳动力。
    在保证第一线有足够劳动力的同时，我们还应该适应生产持续跃进的要求，正确掌握生产高速度发展的比例关系，合理安排和调整各个生产环节的力量。拿采掘工业来说，掘进和运输是两个重要环节，而在这些环节上又往往存在着劳动力比例偏低的状况，这显然是不符合煤焦、矿石持续跃进的要求的。我们在突击煤焦、矿石的生产和运输中，首先就要集结人力，加强这两个方面的战斗力量。但是，就一个地区或一个企业而言，由于条件的差异，薄弱环节也不一定都是掘进和运输，也可能是回采，那么劳动力的安排就要根据当时当地的具体情况作出合理部署。而且我们还要看到，生产中的矛盾总是在不断地发展变化。随着掘进和运输设备、条件等方面的改进，各工序之间生产技术发展的不平衡，旧的薄弱环节克服了，又必然要出现新的薄弱环节，这时劳动力的部署又要根据新情况而定。总之，只要我们善于根据持续跃进的规律，找出在不同时间、地点、条件下，劳动力在各个生产环节上分布的正确比例，就能使劳动力的安排符合生产的要求，并且成为组织持续跃进的保证。
    要作好合理安排劳动力的工作，关键还在于领导是否具有自力更生的思想和决心。为了保证以农业为基础和以钢为纲、全面跃进方针的贯彻，从事工业的同志必须尽最大努力从企业内部挖掘劳动潜力，尽可能不向外面要人。
    合理安排劳动力，一方面，要按照生产高速度发展的要求，找出一线和二线、主要工序和辅助工序以及生产各环节之间在一定条件下应该保持的比例；一方面又要根据政治思想、体力强弱、技术熟练程度等因素来考虑人力的调配使用。由此看来，合理安排劳动力也是领导作风深入的过程，领导水平提高的过程。
