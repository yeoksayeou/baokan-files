Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th - The Lao Fighting Forces Radio Station broadcast a commentary on the 6th, demanding that the Lao Kingdom government accept the five reasonable proposals put forward by the Lao Patriotic Front on September 30th as the basic conditions for negotiations with the Kingdom government, to ensure that the negotiations between the Kingdom government and the Lao Fighting Forces can achieve good results.
The five basic conditions put forward by the Lao Patriotic Front are: 1. Resolutely oppose the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique; 2. Guarantee the democratic rights of the people; 3. Establish a coalition government with the participation of the Lao Patriotic Front; 4. Immediately establish diplomatic relations with socialist countries such as the Soviet Union; 5. Oppose the aggressive bloc of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and interference by the United Nations.
The commentary emphasized, "It is imperative to resolutely oppose the faithful running dog of US imperialism, the Phoumi traitorous clique, and resolutely prevent them from restoring their power in the government and the army. Because, if they control the political power there, they will carry out policies that undermine peace, neutrality, and national harmony, and persecute people who love their country, love peace, and fight for the policy of peace and neutrality."
The commentary said, "The suggestion to guarantee the people's freedom and democratic rights, to stop arresting patriotic and peace-loving people, and to immediately release patriotic people who have been illegally arrested and imprisoned is justified and necessary because, if the people's freedom and democratic rights are not guaranteed, those who merge with the overall national interest will be discriminated against, retaliated against, and have their legitimate activities restricted by reactionary groups."
The commentary said, "Through the people's patriotic struggle movement against US imperialism and its running dogs, the strength of the Lao Patriotic Front has rapidly developed and its prestige has increased day by day. This is an undeniable fact, so it is very necessary to establish a coalition government with the participation of the Lao Fighting Forces. It will be a symbol of national harmony and national unity, and it will be able to concentrate all forces and possibilities to realize the policy of peace and neutrality and build a prosperous motherland."
The commentary said, "To achieve national harmony, we must resolutely implement a policy of peace and neutrality. To do this, we must begin to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, various socialist countries, and neighboring countries, and accept foreign aid without any binding conditions. If this is not done, Laos will still be controlled by US imperialism and its running dogs, creating favorable conditions for them to continue to undermine the policy of peace and neutrality and national harmony."
The commentary said, "The Lao issue must be resolved on the basis of the Geneva Agreement and the Vientiane Agreement. Therefore, we must resolutely oppose the conspiracy of US imperialism to instruct the Southeast Asia military aggressive bloc and the United Nations forces to interfere in Laos' internal affairs."
The commentary concluded, "The presentation of the five proposals demonstrates the Lao Patriotic Front's urgent hope that this negotiation between the Kingdom government and the Lao Patriotic Front can achieve good results. The Lao people believe that Prince Souvanna Phouma's government will approve these reasonable, justified and very necessary proposals of the Lao Patriotic Front." (Attached picture)

    寮国战斗部队电台就谈判问题发表评论
    要求老挝政府接受爱国战线党的建议
    老挝爱国战线党指出，保证谈判能获得美好结果的五个基本条件是：（一）坚决反对诺萨万叛国集团；（二）保证人民民主权利；（三）成立有老挝爱国战线党参加的联合政府；（四）立即与社会主义国家建交；（五）反对东南亚条约侵略集团和联合国干涉。
    新华社河内7日电　寮国战斗部队电台6日发表评论，要求老挝王国政府接受老挝爱国战线党在9月30日提出的作为和王国政府谈判的基本条件的五项合理建议，以保证王国政府同寮国战斗部队的谈判能获得美好的结果。
    老挝爱国战线党提出的五项基本条件是：一、坚决反对富米·诺萨万叛国集团；二、保证人民民主权利；三、成立有老挝爱国战线党参加的联合政府；四、立即同苏联等社会主义国家建立外交关系；五、反对东南亚条约侵略集团和联合国干涉。
    评论强调指出，“必须坚决反对美帝国主义的得力走狗富米叛国集团，坚决不让他们恢复在政府和军队中的权力，因为，他们掌握了那里的政权，他们就要在那里进行破坏和平中立和民族和睦政策、迫害爱国爱和平和为和平中立政策而斗争的人。”
    评论说，“关于保证人民的自由民主权利、停止逮捕爱国爱和平的人民，立即释放被非法逮捕监禁的爱国人民的建议是正当和必要的，因为，如果人民的自由民主权利没有保障，那么，同国家整体合并的人将受到反动集团的歧视、报复和限制他们的合法活动。”
    评论说，“通过人民的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的救国斗争运动，老挝爱国战线党的力量已迅速发展，威信日益提高。这是无可辩驳的事实，因此，成立有寮国战斗部队力量参加的联合政府是很必要的，它将是民族和睦和国家统一的象征，它将能够集中一切力量和可能来实现和平中立政策和建设繁荣的祖国。”
    评论说，“要使民族和睦，必须坚决执行和平中立政策，要做到这一点，必须着手同苏联、各社会主义国家和各邻国建立外交关系，接受不附带任何约束条件的外国援助。如果不那样做的话，老挝将仍然要受美帝国主义及其走狗的控制，为他们继续破坏和平中立和民族和睦政策创造有利条件。”
    评论说，“老挝问题必须在日内瓦协议和万象协议基础上进行解决，因此，必须坚决反对美帝国主义指使东南亚军事侵略集团和联合国军队干涉老挝内政的阴谋。”
    评论最后说，“五项建议的提出，说明了老挝爱国战线党迫切希望王国政府同老挝爱国战线党的这次谈判能够取得美好的结果。老挝人民相信富马亲王政府将赞成老挝爱国战线党的这些合情合理和非常必要的建议。”（附图片）
