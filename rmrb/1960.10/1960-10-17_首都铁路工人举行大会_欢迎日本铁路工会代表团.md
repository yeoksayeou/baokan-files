Xinhua News Agency, 16th -- More than 500 railway workers in the capital held a meeting tonight to warmly welcome the Japanese National Railway Workers' Union delegation, led by Hosoi Soichi, Central Executive Committee member of the Japanese National Railway Workers' Union, and Yoshida Shinji, Central Executive Committee member of the Locomotive Engineers' Union, who are currently visiting our country.

The meeting was presided over by Wang Zanqing, Vice Chairman of the Beijing District Committee of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union. Xiao Hongqi and Xu Ping, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union, attended the meeting.

Xiao Hongqi spoke at the meeting on behalf of the Chinese railway workers, expressing a warm welcome to the Japanese friends. He said that the Chinese railway workers, together with the Chinese people, will continue to support the just struggle of the Japanese railway workers and the Japanese people against the U.S. and for patriotism. The Japanese people will surely be able to overcome the reactionary forces. Despite the various conspiracies of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to persecute and suppress patriotic and democratic forces, final victory will surely belong to the Japanese working class and the Japanese people. He pointed out that in the struggle against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese workers and peoples will be continuously strengthened, and no force in the world can undermine the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese workers and peoples.

Xiao Hongqi, on behalf of the Chinese railway workers, expressed deep condolences for the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma and strongly protested and condemned this conspiracy and atrocity of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

Hosoi Soichi, head of the Japanese National Railway Workers' Union delegation, spoke. He said that during their visit to China, they learned that the Chinese people and the Japanese people are sincerely friendly, and are making efforts to strengthen the solidarity between the two peoples. He thanked the Chinese people for their great support for the just struggle of the Japanese people.

Hosoi Soichi said that after the delegation returns to Japan, they guarantee to put the following into action:

First, in order to establish an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan, we will continue to launch the struggle to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." At the same time, from the standpoint that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Japanese and Chinese people, we will further strive to strengthen the solidarity between the Japanese and Chinese people.

Second, we resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism and the Ikeda Cabinet colluding to implement a policy of hostility towards China and creating the "two Chinas" conspiracy. Therefore, we support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan.

Third, in order to rapidly restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, we will strive to develop the national movement. We support the three political principles and three trade principles put forward by Premier Zhou Enlai.

Fourth, we will not only correctly convey the friendship of the Chinese brothers to the Japanese railway workers, but also to all Japanese workers, and continue to make efforts to continuously strengthen the friendly solidarity between the Japanese and Chinese workers and peoples.

Fifth, in order to strengthen the solidarity between the Japanese and Chinese workers, we will strive to exchange more delegations, especially in order to enable Chinese delegations to freely visit Japan, we solemnly demand that the Ikeda Cabinet adopt a policy that eliminates all obstacles.

Hosoi Soichi finally shouted: "Long live the solidarity between the railway workers and peoples of Japan and China!" "Long live the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong!"

Xiao Hongqi's and Hosoi Soichi's speeches were repeatedly warmly welcomed. After the speeches, the guests and hosts enjoyed a wonderful artistic performance together.

    首都铁路工人举行大会 
    欢迎日本铁路工会代表团
    据新华社16日讯　首都五百多名铁路工人今晚举行大会，热烈欢迎正在我国访问的以日本国营铁道工会中央执行委员细井宗一和动力车工会中央执行委员吉田辛治为首的日本国营铁道工会代表团朋友。
    大会是由中国铁路工会北京区委员会副主席王赞清主持的。中国铁路工会全国委员会副主席萧洪启、徐平都出席了大会。
    萧洪启在大会上讲话代表中国铁路工人向日本朋友们表示热烈欢迎。他说，中国铁路工人同中国人民一道将继续支持日本铁路工人和日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争。日本人民一定能够战胜反动势力，尽管美日反动派策划各种迫害和镇压爱国民主力量的阴谋，但最后胜利一定属于日本工人阶级和日本人民。他指出，在反对我们的共同敌人——美帝国主义的斗争中，中日两国工人和人民的友谊将不断加强，世界上任何力量也破坏不了中日两国工人和人民的友谊。
    萧洪启代表中国铁路职工对浅沼稻次郎的被暗杀表示沉痛的悼念，对美日反动派的这一阴谋暴行表示强烈的抗议和谴责。
    日本国营铁道工会代表团团长细井宗一讲话。他说，他们在中国访问期间了解到中国人民和日本人民真诚友好，并且为加强日中两国人民的团结正在作出努力。他感谢中国人民对日本人民正义斗争的巨大支持。
    细井宗一说，代表团回国以后，保证在以下几点付诸行动：
    一、为了建立独立、民主、和平、中立的日本，我们继续展开废除日美“安全条约”的斗争。同时，从美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人这一立场出发，为加强日中两国人民的团结而进一步奋斗。
    二、我们坚决反对美帝国主义和池田内阁勾结一起，执行敌视中国的政策和制造“两个中国”的阴谋。因此，我们支持中国人民解放台湾的斗争。
    三、为在和平共处五项原则的基础上迅速恢复日中两国的邦交，我们努力发展国民运动。我们支持周恩来总理提出的政治三原则和贸易三原则。
    四、我们不仅向日本铁路工人，而且向日本全体工人正确地传达中国兄弟的友情，为不断加强日中两国工人和人民的友好团结继续作出努力。
    五、为了加强日中两国工人的团结，我们努力争取能交换更多的代表团，特别是为了使中国代表团能自由地访问日本，我们严正地要求池田内阁采取排除一切障碍的政策。
    细井宗一最后高呼：“日中两国铁路工人和两国人民团结万岁！”“伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东主席万岁！”
    萧洪启和细井宗一的讲话一再受到了热烈的欢迎。讲话结束以后，宾主一起欣赏了精采的艺术表演。
