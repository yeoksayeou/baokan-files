Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: The Ministry of National Defense hosted a banquet this evening to warmly welcome the entire delegation of the Korean People's Army Ensemble, led by Major General Zhang Ruihuan, who are visiting China for a friendly performance tour.

Marshal Ye Jianying, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, and Vice Premier of the State Council, Xi Zhongxun, attended the banquet.

General Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered a speech on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense and all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extending the warmest welcome to the distinguished guests who are visiting and performing in our country, bringing with them the profound friendship of the Korean people. He said that under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army, after three years of the Fatherland Liberation War, finally defeated the seemingly invincible American aggressors with their heroic battles. This great victory not only defended Korea's independence, protected China's security, and safeguarded world peace, but also exposed the American paper tiger in front of the people of the world, greatly encouraging the confidence of people of all countries in opposing imperialist aggression. He said that since the Korean armistice, the heroic Korean people have been engaged in great socialist construction with unparalleled heroic and tenacious fighting spirit. With the high speed of Chollima, they are leaping forward along the socialist road. Every victory and achievement of the Korean people adds important strength to safeguarding world peace and promoting the cause of human progress, and is a powerful encouragement and support to the Chinese people. We sincerely and warmly congratulate the great achievements of the Korean people. We are deeply proud to have such a heroic brother and comrade-in-arms.

General Xiao Hua said that in the past ten years, the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Korean people has been further consolidated and developed. The Chinese people will never forget the contributions made by the heroic Korean people in developing this friendship. During the difficult years of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan and the domestic revolutionary war, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people supported the Chinese people with their blood. In the struggle in which the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fought side by side against the American aggressors, the Korean people always cared for and helped the volunteers meticulously. Two years ago, when the Chinese People's Volunteers completely withdrew from Korea, the Korean people gave the volunteers a grand farewell.

General Xiao Hua said that the US imperialism is absolutely unwilling to accept the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese and Korean people in the past ten years. Although it suffered a shameful defeat on the Korean battlefield, it has not given up. It still insists on its sinful policy of hostility towards the Chinese and Korean people, continues to occupy the southern part of Korea and China's territory of Taiwan, and actively carries out military provocations and intensifies its arms expansion and war preparations. He said that the people of China and Korea have a long experience in the anti-imperialist struggle and will never relax their vigilance against any aggressive conspiracy of the bellicose American imperialism. Let us strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, join hands, and fight together against our common enemy and defend peace in the East and the world.

Major General Zhang Ruihuan spoke at the banquet, thanking the Chinese people for their warm welcome. He said that we are very happy to visit China on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war against American aggression. The Korean people commemorate October 25th as a day of unbreakable friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese people. The friendship between the people and armies of Korea and China has been formed, consolidated, and developed in the long-term common struggle against imperialist aggression.

Major General Zhang Ruihuan said that during the most difficult period of our Fatherland Liberation War, the Chinese people organized the Chinese People's Volunteers with their best sons and daughters to fight against the American aggressors together with us, and established immortal feats on the Korean front. The Chinese People's Volunteers also made great contributions to helping our country's economic construction in the post-war period. The Korean people will always remember all of this in their hearts.

Major General Zhang Ruihuan said that the people of Korea and China are not only close comrades-in-arms in the common struggle against imperialist aggression, but also close brothers who support and help each other in the common cause of building socialism and communism. Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have created world-shaking miracles in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction. Our people have also stepped onto the Chollima and are advancing towards the peak of socialism.

After condemning the crimes of US imperialism, which is still intensifying international tensions, hostile to the people of Korea and China, and continuing to invade the southern half of Korea and China's territory of Taiwan, Major General Zhang Ruihuan said that US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of Korea and China, and US imperialism must get out of the southern part of Korea and China's territory of Taiwan.

Major General Zhang Ruihuan finally said that the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army are always vigilant in guarding the eastern frontier of the socialist camp, and constantly monitor the enemy's every move. We are confident that with the active support of the people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people in the world, the just, common, and great struggle of the people of Korea and China will surely achieve final victory.

The banquet was filled with a warm and brotherly friendly atmosphere. The guests frequently toasted to the unbreakable fighting friendship between the people and armies of China and Korea, and to the health of Marshal Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong.

The Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, Li Yonghao, and officials from the embassy were invited to attend the banquet.

Accompanying the guests at the banquet were General Zhang Aiping, General Li Zhimin, Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Lieutenant General Tang Tianji, Lieutenant General Wang Huiqiu of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Chen Renqi, Lieutenant General Xiang Zhonghua, Lieutenant General Mo Wenhua, Lieutenant General Zhang Nansheng, Lieutenant General Ouyang Wen, Rear Admiral Duan Dechang of the Navy and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as representatives of officers from the army, navy, and air force stationed in Beijing and literary and art workers from the troops, Luo Diekai, father of martyr Luo Shengjiao, and combat heroes and meritorious representatives of the former Volunteers, Hu Xiudao and Guo Enzhi.

Also accompanying the guests at the banquet were Zhang Yan, Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the State Council, Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture, Chu Tunan and Qu Wu, Deputy Directors of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Wu Han, Vice Mayor of Beijing, Lao She, Vice President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, and relevant persons in charge and artists from the literary and art circles.

    国防部欢宴朝鲜人民军协奏团
    叶剑英元帅、习仲勋副总理出席了宴会
    新华社24日讯　国防部今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎由张瑞焕少将率领来我国作友好访问演出的朝鲜人民军协奏团全体贵宾。
    国防委员会副主席叶剑英元帅、国务院副总理习仲勋出席了宴会。
    中国人民解放军总政治部副主任萧华上将代表国防部和中国人民解放军全体官兵，在宴会上向带着朝鲜人民深情厚谊来我国访问演出的贵宾们表示最热烈的欢迎。他说，英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的正确领导下，经过三年的祖国解放战争，终于以自己的英勇战斗，打败了不可一世的美国侵略者。这一伟大胜利，不仅保卫了朝鲜的独立，保卫了中国的安全，保卫了世界和平，而且在全世界人民面前戳穿了美国纸老虎，大大鼓舞了各国人民反对帝国主义侵略的信心。他说，朝鲜停战以后，英雄的朝鲜人民又以无比英勇顽强的战斗精神，从事伟大的社会主义建设。以千里马的高速度，沿着社会主义的大道突飞猛进。朝鲜人民的每一个胜利和成就都给保卫世界和平和促进人类进步事业增添了重要的力量，是对中国人民的有力鼓舞和支持。我们衷心地、热烈地祝贺朝鲜人民的伟大成就。我们深深地以有这样一个英雄的兄弟和战友而感到自豪。
    萧华上将说，在过去十年中，中朝两国人民的传统友谊，获得了进一步的巩固与发展。英雄的朝鲜人民在发展这种友谊中所作出的贡献，我国人民将永远不忘。在我国人民进行抗日战争和国内革命战争的艰苦岁月里，朝鲜人民的优秀儿女以鲜血支援了中国人民，在中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩抗击美国侵略者的斗争中，朝鲜人民更是始终如一日地、无微不至地关怀和帮助志愿军。两年前，中国人民志愿军全部撤离朝鲜时，朝鲜人民又对志愿军进行盛情欢送。
    萧华上将说，中朝两国人民过去十年来取得的辉煌胜利，美帝国主义是绝不甘心的。尽管它在朝鲜战场上遭到了可耻的惨败，但它并没有死心，现在仍然坚持敌视中朝人民的罪恶政策，继续霸占着朝鲜南部和我国领土台湾，积极进行军事挑衅和加紧扩军备战。他说，朝中两国人民有着长期的反帝国主义斗争经验，对于好战成性的美帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋，决不会放松警惕的。让我们加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，携起手来，为反对我们共同的敌人，捍卫东方和世界和平而共同奋斗。
    张瑞焕少将在宴会上讲了话，他对中国人民的热烈欢迎表示感谢。他说，我们在中国人民志愿军参加抗美战争十周年纪念的前夕，到中国来访问，感到非常高兴。朝鲜人民把10月25日这一天当作朝中两国人民牢不可破的友谊和团结的日子来纪念。朝中两国人民和军队之间的友谊是在反对帝国主义侵略的长期共同斗争中形成、巩固和发展起来的。
    张瑞焕少将说，在我们祖国解放战争最艰难的时期，中国人民以自己最优秀的儿女组织了中国人民志愿军，和我们共同抗击美国侵略者，在朝鲜前线树立了不朽的功勋。中国人民志愿军还在战后时期，在帮助我国经济建设事业中也作出了巨大的贡献。对于这一切，朝鲜人民将永远铭记在心里。
    张瑞焕少将说，朝中两国人民不仅在反对帝国主义侵略的共同斗争中是亲密的战友，而在建设社会主义和共产主义的共同事业中，也是互相支持和互相帮助的亲兄弟。现在，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在建设社会主义的大跃进中，创造了惊动世界的奇迹。我国人民也跨上千里马，正向着社会主义的高峰前进。
    张瑞焕少将在谴责美帝国主义至今仍在加紧国际紧张局势、敌视朝中两国人民，继续侵略朝鲜南半部和中国领土台湾的罪行后说，美帝国主义是朝中两国人民最凶恶的敌人，美帝国主义必须从朝鲜南部和中国领土台湾滚出去。
    张瑞焕少将最后说，朝鲜人民军官兵时刻警惕地守卫着社会主义阵营的东方前哨，经常监视着敌人的一举一动。我们相信，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的人民和全世界爱好和平人民的积极支持下，朝中两国人民的正义的共同的伟大斗争，一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    宴会上充满了热烈的兄弟般的友好气氛。宾主频频为中朝两国人民及其军队牢不可破的战斗友谊，为金日成元帅和毛泽东主席的健康而干杯。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使李永镐和大使馆官员应邀出席了宴会。
    出席宴会作陪的，有张爱萍上将、李志民上将、刘志坚中将、唐天际中将、王辉球空军中将、陈仁麒中将、向仲华中将、莫文骅中将、张南生中将、欧阳文中将、段德彰海军少将等中国人民解放军高级将领以及陆、海、空军驻京部队军官代表和部队文艺工作者，罗盛教烈士的父亲罗迭开，前志愿军战斗英雄、功臣代表胡修道、郭恩志等。
    出席宴会作陪的，还有国务院外事办公室副主任张彦，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，文化部副部长夏衍，对外文化联络委员会副主任楚图南、屈武，北京市副市长吴晗，中国朝鲜友好协会副会长老舍，以及文艺界有关负责人和艺术家等。
