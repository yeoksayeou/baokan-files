Second Trip to Hainan (Three Poems)
    Zhu Guang
    Asking the Sea
    I revisit the South Sea to ask the azure waves,
    How many times has the raging wind goddess passed?
    The waves are calm and boundless like a morning mirror,
    Where the red glow rises, there are fishermen's songs.
    Scattered Coconut Grove
    Walking the beach, the coconut grove seems to strive for the sky,
    Facing the wind, phoenix wings dance gracefully,
    Village children graze cattle, roasting coconuts until ripe,
    Waves surge, tides rise, the moon is perfectly round.
    Visiting the Forest Farm
    The forest farm stretches a hundred miles, lush and green,
    Everywhere, mountain slopes are busy with land reclamation,
    Iron horses gallop, clearing wild thorns,
    Singing loudly of the commune, a good home.

    二次海南行（三首）
    朱光
    问海
    重来南海问沧波，
    肆虐风姨几度过，
    浪静无垠如晓镜，
    红霞起处有渔歌。
    椰林散
    步滨海椰林欲搏天，
    迎风凤翼舞翩翩，
    村童放牧煨椰熟，
    浪涌潮来月正圆。
    游林场
    林场百里郁苍苍，
    处处山腰拓垦忙，
    铁马奔驰芟野棘，
    高歌公社好家乡。
