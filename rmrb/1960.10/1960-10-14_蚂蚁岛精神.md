    The Spirit of Ant Island
    Chen Shan
    The scenery of Mount Putuo is beautiful, the commune of Ant Island is good;
    Mount Putuo has many rocks and trees, Ant Island has many fishing boats and nets.
    Songs are loud and the tide echoes, the island is bustling with joy;
    The Communist Party that saves people from suffering has arrived, and the emancipated fishermen have a lot of energy!
    Before dawn, they set sail, the clouds chasing the motorized sailing fleet,
    Waves, oh waves, please make way, I will cast my net and start encircling.
    The fish swarm into the net with a splashing sound, attracting the sun to peek out its red head!
    A golden waterfall pours down the hatch, the fish swarm comes with the tide!
    Those who have suffered enough dare not forget their roots, working day and night to repay their benefactors!
    The waves of Lüsi Ocean bloom on the mast, the sails are not lowered for three consecutive months;
    The rain at Xiangshan Port is like rapid bullets, passing by the hometown but not entering the door;
    The north wind blows backward on the Shengsi Ocean, let the frost beat the beard three inches white!
    With the morning sun in the heart and red glow on the face, the best fresh fish are dedicated to the country:
    Pomfret is like a tin basin, belt fish is like a silver knife, cuttlefish contains eggs, and the grabbing crabs are full of red roe.
    Let the workers and peasants eat well and have enough, wave after wave to set off a high tide of the Great Leap Forward!
    Diligence and thrift in running the society are a source of pride for everyone, wholeheartedly for the prosperity of the country and a strong army for the sake of tomorrow.
    This year's output strives for 500,000 dan, how big the sea is, how big the Chao people's courage is!
    Hard struggle has refined iron arms, so we can hold up this golden rice bowl of the East China Sea.
    The technical revolution takes the lead, the heat of the people boils the sea dry and the stones rotten;
    The mind starts the continuous revolution motor, even bare hands can generate electricity!
    Ten years ago, Ant Island was a poor man soaking in a sea of bitterness,
    The sunshine of the Party urged it to hatch, the first people's commune appeared here;
    The golden rooster comes out of its shell and rolls on the ground, rolling away poverty and blankness and becoming brilliant all over!
    Singing aloud "Every Family Red," striving to be strong is the true hero!

    蚂蚁岛精神
    陈山普陀山的风景好，蚂蚁岛的公社好；普陀山上石头树木多，蚂蚁岛边渔船渔网多。歌声响亮潮声应，岛上忙得真高兴；来了救苦救难的共产党，翻了身的渔民一股子劲！天不亮就扬帆出海，云彩追赶着机帆船队，海浪啊海浪你快让开，撒下了大网我就开始兜围。鱼群上网泼喇喇的响，引得太阳探出了个红脑袋！船舱口泻下了金瀑布，鱼群随潮滚滚来！受够了苦中苦那个敢忘本，披星戴月报答恩人！吕泗洋的浪花开上桅杆，一连三月不下风帆；象山港口雨像急弹，路过家乡不进门槛；嵊泗洋面北风倒刮，随它霜打胡须三寸白！胸有朝阳面上露红霞，最好的鱼鲜都献给国家：鲳鱼像锡盆带鱼像银刀，乌贼含卵黄抢蟹满红膏。让工农兄弟吃饱吃好，一浪又一浪掀起大跃进的高
  潮！勤俭办社人人引为荣耀，富国强兵一心只为明朝。今年的产量争取五十万担，海有多大的潮人有多大的胆！艰苦奋斗炼出了铁膀子，就端得起东海这口金饭碗。技术革命一马当先，人的热气煮得海枯石头烂；心里开动了不断革命的马达，赤手空拳也能够放电！十年前的蚂蚁岛啊，苦海里泡着个穷光蛋，党的阳光催它孵化，第一个人民公社在这里出现；金鸡出壳着地打个滚，滚掉了一穷二白通身灿烂！昂头高唱“家家红”，发愤图强才是真好汉！
