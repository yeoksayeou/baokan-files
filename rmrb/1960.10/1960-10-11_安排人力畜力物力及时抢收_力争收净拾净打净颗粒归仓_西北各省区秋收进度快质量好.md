Shaanxi

(Our newspaper's dispatch from Xi'an, October 10) The autumn harvest campaign is in full swing in Shaanxi Province. As of October 6th, over 8,496,000 mu of autumn fields have been harvested, accounting for 23.2% of the total autumn field area.

This year, the autumn field area in Shaanxi Province is larger than in previous years, with more late-autumn crops and varied species with different maturity periods. In order to harvest quickly and well, party organizations at all levels throughout the province have conducted extensive propaganda and education among the masses since the beginning of the autumn harvest, making them fully aware that this year's autumn harvest work must not only accelerate the pace of harvesting but also improve the quality of harvesting and threshing. At the same time, various localities have universally organized commune members to conduct field debates, on-site visits, promote advanced experiences, and carry out competitions to ensure that this year's autumn grain is harvested quickly and well. In Yangxian County, various communes have universally put forward the slogan of harvesting 20 more jin of grain per mu through debates, visits, and other methods, and after discussion by commune members, specific measures for careful harvesting and threshing were formulated. The Yan'an County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promoted the "three sweeps and two picks" method of Gao Ruman and other members of the Yangqiao Production Team of Nian'an Commune (sweeping the crop beds in the fields, sweeping the resting spots on the roads, sweeping the grass beds on the edge of the threshing ground, picking in the fields, picking on the roads), and the county has recovered more than 20,000 jin of grain. At the beginning of the autumn harvest, Baihe County organized more than 40,000 people participating in the autumn harvest throughout the county to carry out competitions in careful harvesting, meticulous threshing, quick harvesting, and fast threshing between communes, production teams, and individuals. As of October 2nd, the 120,000 mu of autumn fields that had matured throughout the county were generally harvested as soon as they matured, threshed cleanly, and dried, making the autumn harvest work both fast and good.

Gansu

(Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, October 10) The autumn harvest work in Gansu Province is developing vigorously. According to statistics as of October 5th, the harvested crops account for 36% of the total autumn harvest area.

Under the guidance of the thought of the Party's vigorous promotion of agriculture and grain production, all parts of Gansu have paid attention to careful harvesting and meticulous threshing. Many people's communes in the Tianshui area, before harvesting, by arranging work processes, checking loopholes, and carefully summarizing the experience of careful harvesting and meticulous threshing over the years, have ensured that autumn fields have practical and effective measures from the beginning of harvesting to entry into the warehouse, avoiding losses and harvesting more grain. The people's communes in Jingning, Qingyang, and other counties have implemented the method of "fixed person, fixed land, fixed time, fixed work, and fixed leadership" according to the different autumn crops and maturity sequence, and announced it on the list, achieving the goal of harvesting as soon as a piece of land is ripe. This ensured clean, meticulous, and timely harvesting.

During the autumn harvest, autumn-picking and grain-gleaning teams were universally organized in various places, striving not to lose a single grain or ear. The Yanzhi Commune in Hezheng County organized more than 1,500 auxiliary laborers and 85 groups to conduct secondary harvesting and threshing of harvested plots, roads, and field edges, and has recovered a lot of grain.

Xinjiang

(Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, October 10) Members of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are seizing the time to harvest various autumn-ripening crops, striving for good, careful, and clean harvesting. The southern Xinjiang region, which matured earlier, began the autumn harvest in early September, and the harvesting progress is accelerating day by day. Among them, the daily harvesting progress of corn in the Kashgar area alone reached about 100,000 mu.

This year, the area of various autumn-ripening crops in Xinjiang is larger than last year, with more crop types, and intercropping and interplanting are more common, and the harvesting period is very inconsistent. In order to ensure the timely harvesting of various crops, leading cadres at all levels of the Party Committee have implemented the method of dividing areas and contracting and dividing lines of responsibility, participating in harvesting, summarizing experiences, and promoting them, so that the autumn harvest work is carried out quickly and well.

In order to eliminate scattering and waste, all people's communes and state farms have organized harvesting, threshing, transportation, cotton picking, and other professional teams according to the specialties of the members, and established a mutual inspection responsibility system between the professional teams, so that they can harvest, transport, thresh, and dry and store in a timely manner.

Ningxia

(Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, October 10) All parts of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region organized more than 370,000 Hui and Han commune members to fight floods and seize the time to harvest autumn-ripening crops. So far, the region has harvested more than 5 million mu of autumn-ripening crops such as rice, oilseeds, and various coarse grains.

In late September, just as the region entered the intense stage of autumn harvest, it rained continuously for eight days in various places, bringing great difficulties to the autumn harvest work. In order to complete the harvesting tasks of various crops in a timely manner, party committees at all levels issued emergency calls, mobilizing the whole party and the whole people to brave the rain to rush to harvest, drain water, fight disasters, and compete with the sky for grain. During this period, leaders at all levels and the vast number of cadres went deep into the front line of the rush to harvest, and they and the vast number of members rushed to fight floods and seize the time to harvest in the rain; the staff and workers of factories and mines, the teachers and students of schools, also braved the rain to participate in the rush to harvest, thus doubling the labor force participating in the autumn harvest throughout the region, greatly accelerating the progress of the autumn harvest. According to the situation that grain crops are particularly prone to shedding and scattering after being flooded, various places have organized several teams of people for rush harvesting, rush transportation, and rush drying, which not only guaranteed speed but also guaranteed quality.

Qinghai

(Our newspaper's dispatch from Xining, October 10) The vast number of cadres and staff members of people's communes, state farms, and agency farms in Qinghai Province are happily harvesting the fruits of their labor on this year's newly reclaimed land. Under the Qilian Mountains, along the Qinghai Lake, and on the vast newly reclaimed land on both banks of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, a moving scene of joy and busyness is presented everywhere. At present, wheat and other wheat crops on the newly reclaimed land have been mostly harvested and are being threshed in a concentrated manner; rapeseed and potatoes are also being actively harvested.

In order to do a good job in the first autumn harvest on the newly reclaimed land, all parts of Qinghai Province have universally established special institutions such as autumn harvest headquarters to strengthen the specific leadership of the autumn harvest work, concentrate a large number of labor forces and livestock forces, and rush to harvest. In Nangqian County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the labor force participating in the rush to harvest reached more than 80% of the total labor force. People's communes, state farms, and agency farms have also widely launched large-scale cooperation, supporting each other in terms of labor, livestock, tools, and other aspects to ensure the smooth progress of the autumn harvest task.

    陕西
    本报西安10日电　陕西省各地的秋收运动正在紧张进行。截至10月6日，已收获秋田八百四十九万六千多亩，占秋田总面积的23.2％。
    今年，陕西省秋田面积比往年大，晚秋作物多，品种不一，成熟期不同。为了收得又快又好，秋收开始后，全省各级党组织即对群众进行了广泛的宣传教育，使群众充分地认识到今年的秋收工作，既要加快收割的进度，又要提高收割、碾打的质量。同时，各地普遍组织社员进行田头辩论、现场参观，推广先进经验和开展竞赛等办法，使今年秋粮收得又快又好。洋县各公社通过辩论、参观等办法，普遍提出每亩多收二十斤粮的口号，并且经过社员群众讨论制定了细收细打的具体措施。中共延安县委推广了拈安公社杨桥生产小队社员高如满等二人的“三扫两拣”（扫地里的放庄稼摊，扫路上的息背摊，扫场边的草摊，地里拣，路上拣）的办法，全县已拣回两万多斤粮食。白河县在秋收一开始，就组织领导全县参加秋收的四万多人，开展公社与公社、生产队与生产队、个人与个人之间的细收细打、快收快打竞赛。到10月2日，全县已成熟的十二万亩秋田，普遍做到随熟、随收，并且打净、晒干，使秋收工作既快又好。
    甘肃
    据新华社兰州10日电　甘肃省秋收工作正在蓬勃展开。到10月5日的统计，已收的各种作物占秋收总面积的36％。
    在党的大办农业、大办粮食的思想指导下，甘肃各地都注意精收细打，天水地区许多人民公社，收割前通过排工序，查漏洞，认真总结了历年来细收细打的经验，使秋田从开始收割到入库，环环都有切实有效的措施，避免损失，多收粮食。静宁、庆阳等县的各人民公社根据不同秋作物和成熟先后等情况，实行“定人、定地、定时、定工、定领导”的办法，列榜公布，达到了黄一块收一块。保证了收的净、收的细、收的及时。
    在秋收中，各地都普遍组织了拾秋拣粮队，力争一粒一穗不丢。和政县胭脂公社组织了一千五百多名辅助劳力，八十五个小组，对秋收过的地块、道路、场边进行二次收打，已收回许多粮食。
    新疆
    据新华社乌鲁木齐10日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各族社员正抓紧收割各类秋熟作物，力争收好、收细、收净。成熟较早的南疆地区，9月初就开始秋收，收割进度一天比一天加快。其中喀什专区光是玉米日收进度就达到十万亩左右。
    新疆今年各类秋熟作物面积比去年大，作物种类多，间作套种比较普遍，收割期很不一致。为了保证适时收好各类作物，各级党委领导干部都实行了分片包干和分线负责的办法，参加收打，总结经验，加以推广，使秋收工作进行得又快又好。
    为了杜绝抛撒浪费，各人民公社和国营农场都按社员的专长组织收割、打场、拉运、拾棉等专业队，并在各专业队之间建立起互相检查的责任制，作到随收、随运、随打和及时晾晒入仓。
