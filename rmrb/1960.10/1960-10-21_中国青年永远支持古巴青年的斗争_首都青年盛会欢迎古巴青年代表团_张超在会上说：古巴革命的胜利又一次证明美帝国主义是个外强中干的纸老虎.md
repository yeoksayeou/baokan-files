Xinhua News Agency, October 20th -- Over a thousand young people in the capital held a gathering in the auditorium of Tsinghua University tonight, warmly welcoming the Cuban Youth Delegation from the heroic nation. The大会庄严地表示: proclaimed solemnly: The 130 million Chinese youth will always be the loyal friends of Cuban youth in the struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Members of the Cuban Youth Delegation attending tonight's meeting included: Gerardo Figueras, Secretary of Foreign Relations of the Cuban "July 26th" Movement; Captain Fernando Ravelo, National Leader of the Cuban Rebel Army Youth Association; Oscar Fernández Padilla, Secretary of the National Committee of the Cuban Socialist Youth League; and Omar Rouga Soler, Representative of the Cuban University Students Federation and Vice Chairman of the Student Union of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Havana. Also attending the meeting were Carlos Quintanilla and Niurka Escalante, the Cuban representatives from the Latin American Communist Youth League Delegation, who are currently visiting Beijing. As they entered the venue, the audience erupted in enthusiastic applause, singing the self-composed song "Support You, Cuban Brothers," to express a warm welcome to the Cuban guests standing at the forefront of the struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Zhang Chao, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, spoke at the meeting, extending the warmest welcome to the Cuban Youth Delegation.

Zhang Chao praised Cuba as a heroic nation and the Cuban people as heroic people. He said that the heroic spirit and revolutionary spirit of the Cuban people and youth, who dare to despise U.S. imperialism and other enemies and dare to rise up in struggle, have won the deep sympathy and heartfelt praise of the Chinese people and all progressive mankind.

Zhang Chao sternly condemned the extremely vicious U.S. imperialism for adopting means such as military threats, economic blockades, and subversive conspiracies in an attempt to strangle the Cuban revolution, weaken its influence, isolate Cuba, and strengthen its control and enslavement of Latin American countries. Zhang Chao pointed out that the heroic Cuban people and youth have not been intimidated; on the contrary, they are fighting more resolutely. Zhang Chao said that the Cuban revolution has once again shown us that the U.S. imperialism, with its bared fangs and seemingly powerful appearance, is nothing more than a paper tiger, strong in appearance but weak in reality. The real strength lies in the Cuban people, who are united for justice and persevere in struggle. In his speech, Zhang Chao warmly praised the "Havana Declaration" announced by Cuba, pointing out that the declaration reflects the fighting will and determination of the Latin American people and has won the support and sympathy of all progressive people in the world. Zhang Chao said that as long as the Cuban people continue to strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, and fight resolutely, victory will surely belong to the Cuban people.

Zhang Chao said that under the wise leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people and youth are holding aloft the three red banners of the General Line for Socialist Construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and are carrying out a great and arduous struggle to build socialism and rapidly rid our country of its economic and cultural backwardness. He said that in order to carry out socialist construction smoothly, we need a lasting international environment of peace and the friendship of the people and youth of all countries. Therefore, we must further strengthen our close unity with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and we also firmly support the national democratic movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and continuously gain support and inspiration from their struggles and victories. Although China and Cuba are located on two continents, the common struggle against U.S. imperialism and in defense of world peace closely connects us. The youth of the two countries have forged a fighting friendship. We regard your struggles and victories as our struggles and victories. We shout together with you: "Yes to Cuba, No to the Yankees!" Please believe, Cuban friends, that whether in the past, present, or future, Chinese youth will always be the loyal friends of Cuban youth.

Gerardo Figueras, Secretary of Foreign Relations of the Cuban "July 26th" Movement, spoke on behalf of all members of the youth delegation. In his speech, he expressed the Cuban people's and Cuban youth's determination to resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism and their deep friendship with the Chinese people and Chinese youth.

He said that the main enemy of our people—U.S. imperialism—is also the common enemy of the Chinese people, the Chinese revolution, and all peace-loving and progressive people and governments around the world. We deeply hate U.S. imperialism and its warmongering allies, the supporters of the Cold War and colonialism.

In his speech, he cited facts to condemn U.S. imperialism for pursuing policies of aggression and infiltration around the world. He said that we regard the imperialist policies of the United States and its allies as the main cause of backwardness and poverty for people all over the world, and as a constant danger of a new world war.

He said that the Cuban people express their firm support for all the achievements and measures made by the glorious Chinese revolution in the past eleven years. He said, we firmly support the struggle of the Chinese youth to build a just and happy motherland, welcome the cooperative, friendly and peaceful policies of the government of the People's Republic of China, and also express our sympathy to the Chinese workers, peasants and ordinary people.

He concluded by saying that our delegation is convinced that our visit to the fraternal People's Republic of China will further strengthen the bonds of friendship connecting our two peoples and promote the exchange of experiences and culture between our two countries and our two youth. He said that the fact that our country severed diplomatic relations with the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime and established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China clearly proves this point. In his speech, he shouted: "Yes to Cuba, Yes to China, No to the Yankees!" After his speech, he presented a Cuban flag and a flag of the "July 26th" Movement to the All-China Youth Federation.

The speeches by Zhang Chao and Gerardo Figueras were constantly interrupted by thunderous applause. The young people participating in the meeting were all in high spirits, rhythmically shouting "Yes to Cuba, No to the Yankees!" in between their speeches.

Also participating in today's meeting were Yang Haibo, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League; Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation; Wang Chuanbin, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Youth Federation; Guan Shixiong and Zhou Shixian, heads of Beijing youth organizations; and youth representatives Zhang Jiming, Zhang Xueshu, and Zhang Baifa, who had previously visited Cuba.

Before the welcoming meeting, the Cuban Youth Delegation had a cordial meeting with the Chinese youth representatives who had previously visited Cuba. (Attached picture)
