Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi: Despite a series of emergency measures taken by the Indian government, such as cutting the quantity of imported goods and lifting restrictions on export commodities, India's foreign exchange reserves continued to fall to 1,391.8 million rupees by the end of September. Western news agencies, in reporting this news on the 11th, emphasized that "this is the lowest figure ever reached, illustrating how serious India's foreign exchange situation is."

Indian Finance Minister Desai, who actively sought foreign aid in Britain and the United States to solve financial difficulties, returned to New Delhi on the 11th. According to the Indian Information Service, Desai said in Bombay that the specific details of foreign aid for India's Third Five-Year Plan will only be known after the "Aid India" meeting of five World Bank member states (the United States, Britain, West Germany, Japan, and Canada) reconvenes in Washington next March.

During his stay abroad, Desai met with heads of government, bankers, and industrialists from Western countries such as Britain and the United States, and attended the Commonwealth Finance Ministers Meeting, the World Bank Board of Directors Meeting, and the International Monetary Fund Meeting.

According to the Press Trust of India, Desai said in Washington on September 27 that India needs $10 billion in aid annually for the next decade.

According to the "Times of India" on the 11th, the U.S. government has recently agreed to provide India with $250 million in new loans as the first "aid" for India's Third Five-Year Plan.

The Indian "New Age" weekly published an article on October 2 regarding Desai's seeking "aid" from Western countries, criticizing the Indian government's increasing reliance on Western monopoly capital. It said that Western monopolists are "now using India's need for foreign aid to undermine or control the public sector." The article also stated that "imperialism is putting pressure on India, forcing it to accept more and more private investment." The article pointed out that these "Western benefactors" not only want to influence India's plans but are also trying to influence India's foreign policy as a prerequisite for "aid."

    印度外汇储备下降到空前最低数字
    德赛说印度今后十年需要百亿美元“援助”
    “新世纪”周报说西方国家想以“援助”影响印度外交政策
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：尽管印度政府采取了削减进口货物数量和取消对出口商品的限制等一系列紧急措施，印度外汇储备数字到9月底已继续下降到十三亿九千一百八十万卢比。西方通讯社在11日报道这一消息时强调指出，“这是从来没有达到过的最低数字，说明了印度外汇情况是何等严重。”
    为了解决财政困难去英美积极寻找外援的印度财政部长德赛，已经在11日回到新德里。据印度新闻处报道，德赛在孟买发表谈话说，外国对印度第三个五年计划进行援助的具体情况，要等世界银行五个会员国（美国、英国、西德、日本和加拿大）明年3月再度在华盛顿召开的“援助印度”会议决定后才能见分晓。
    这次德赛在国外逗留期间，曾同英美等西方国家的政府首脑、银行家和实业家会谈，并且出席了英联邦财政部长会议、世界银行董事会会议和国际货币基金组织会议。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，9月27日德赛在华盛顿说，印度在今后十年内每年需要十亿美元的援助。
    据11日的“印度时报”报道，美国政府最近已经答应给印度二亿五千万美元新贷款，作为对印度第三个五年计划的第一笔“援助”。
    印度“新世纪”周报10月2日就德赛到西方国家寻求“援助”发表文章，抨击印度政府日益投靠西方垄断资本。它说，西方垄断资本家“现在正利用印度对外援的需要来搞垮或控制公营部分”。文章又说，“帝国主义正在对印度施加压力，迫使它接受愈来愈多的私人投资。”文章指出，这些“西方的援助者”不仅想影响印度的计划，并且努力想影响印度的外交政策以作为“援助”的先决条件。
