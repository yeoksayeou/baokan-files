    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou Electric Dispatch: The staff of the Shangxiyuan Coal Briquette Processing and Transfer Station of the Lanzhou Fuel Company vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, realizing the automation of coal briquette production. After this reform, the number of workers in the coal briquette workshop was reduced from the original 59 to 10. It is preliminarily estimated that the annual output of coal briquettes can be increased by about 10,000 tons, and the cost can be reduced by 6%.
    Now, entering the coal briquette processing workshop of the Shangxiyuan Coal Briquette Processing and Transfer Station, one can see that coal and soil are automatically fed into the machine from underground ditches, automatically proportioned, crushed, mixed with water, formed into briquettes, dried, stored, and loaded onto vehicles. Each process is entirely operated remotely by two workers in the control room. One person watches the gas stove, and two people patrol to check the machine's operation. Before automation, the manual operation of coal and soil input required 42 workers, resulting in low efficiency and high labor intensity. Now, the scene of coal dust flying and workers' faces being blackened, which was common inside and outside the workshop in the past, has been basically eliminated, and the sanitary conditions of the workplace have been completely changed.

    煤球生产自动线
    据新华社兰州电　兰州市燃料公司上西园煤球加工转运处职工大闹技术革新和技术革命，实现了煤球生产自动化。经过这一改革，煤球车间的工人由原来的五十九名减至十名，初步估计一年可以增产煤球一万吨左右，成本可以降低6％。
    现在，走进上西园煤球加工转运处的煤球加工车间，只见煤、土从地下沟内自动入机、自动配料、粉碎、上水搅拌、成球、烘干、入库、装车，各道工序全部由两名工人在操纵室里远距离操作，一人看烧煤气炉，两人巡回检查机器运转情况。自动化前，由于煤、土输入要靠手工操作，需要四十二名工人，工效低，劳动强度大。现在，车间内外过去那种煤粉飞扬、工人手脸乌黑的景象，已经基本消灭，工作场所的卫生条件得到了彻底改变。
