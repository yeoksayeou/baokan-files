Xinhua News Agency, October 13th dispatch from Vientiane: US Assistant Secretary of State Parsons rushed to Vientiane from Bangkok yesterday. Accompanying him were US Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, Irwin II, and US Pacific Fleet Chief of Staff, Halleberte. According to a report by United Press International, Parsons said upon arriving in Vientiane that his "visit may foreshadow a change in US policy toward Laos." Another report by the Associated Press stated that the United States is "preparing" to "announce a new policy toward Laos," and "this preparation may mean that the United States is planning to shift from supporting the Phouma regime to supporting the Nosavan regime."

According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Vientiane, Parsons held a three-hour meeting with Lao Kingdom Government Prime Minister Phouma on the day of his arrival. The report said that Parsons is scheduled to go to Luang Prabang on the 14th to meet with the King of Laos.

The report said that after concluding his visit to Laos, Parsons will also travel to Thailand, South Vietnam and other places to conduct activities. Thailand and South Vietnam are currently two bases that the United States is using to interfere in Laos. A Reuters report said that while Parsons was conducting activities in Laos, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's Representative Council, under US manipulation, held a secret meeting in Bangkok on the 12th to plot further interference in Laos.

Xinhua News Agency, October 13th dispatch from Bangkok: According to Agence France-Presse, Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat told reporters in Bangkok today that US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Parsons has proposed to Lao Prime Minister Prince Phouma that he immediately suspend negotiations between the Lao Kingdom Government and the Lao Patriotic Front as a condition for restoring US military "aid" to the Lao government.

Sarit applauded this blatant act of US imperialism interfering in Laos' affairs, saying that he was "very pleased" that the United States "clearly understood" Thailand's support for the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak traitorous clique, its opposition to the Lao Kingdom Government, and its support for "anti-communist forces in the free world," and expressed his "pleasure" at the US suspension of military "aid" to Laos.

    美国露骨干涉老挝内政
    帕森斯竟要富马政府中止万象谈判
    据新华社13日讯　万象消息：美国助理国务卿帕森斯昨天从曼谷匆忙赶到万象。同他一道前往的有美国国防部负责国际安全事务的助理部长欧文第二和美国太平洋舰队参谋长黑里伯特。据合众国际社报道，帕森斯到达万象时又说，他“这次访问可能预示着美国对老挝政策的改变”。另据美联社的一则消息报道，美国正在为“宣布对老挝的新政策”作“准备”，“这种准备可能意味着美国正在计划从支持富马政权改而支持诺萨万政权”。
    据法新社万象消息，帕森斯在到达的当天，同老挝王国政府首相富马举行了三小时的会谈。消息说，帕森斯预定14日去朗勃拉邦同老挝国王会谈。
    消息说，帕森斯在结束了对老挝的访问以后，还将到泰国、越南南方等地进行活动。泰国和越南南方目前正是美国利用来干涉老挝的两个基地。路透社消息说，在帕森斯到老挝进行活动的同时，东南亚条约组织代表理事会在美国操纵下，12日在曼谷举行了秘密会议，策划对老挝的进一步干涉。
    据新华社13日讯　曼谷消息：据法新社报道，泰国总理乃沙立今天在曼谷告诉报界人士说，美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿帕森斯已经向老挝首相富马亲王提出，要求立即中止老挝王国政府同老挝爱国战线党之间的谈判，作为恢复美国给老挝政府军事“援助”的条件。
    乃沙立为美帝国主义这一粗暴干涉老挝的行动叫好，他说，他对美国“清楚地了解”泰国支持富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛国集团、反对老挝王国政府的立场和支持“自由世界的反共势力”，感到“非常高兴”，并且对美国停止给老挝军事“援助”表示“高兴”。
