    The Dagger is Revealed When the Map Unrolls
    Yi Heyuan
    Inejiro Asanuma, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, was assassinated by a fascist thug on the eve of the Japanese general election. When the murderer Otoya Yamaguchi struck, there were many plainclothes policemen and Liberal Democratic Party guards on the scene, but none of them stepped forward to stop him. According to the Associated Press, when Yamaguchi, wearing a black student uniform, stabbed Asanuma with a foot-long knife, Prime Minister Ikeda and Democratic Socialist Party leader Nishio were on the same platform a few feet away.
    In broad daylight, in a public place, the murderer was able to act wantonly, while the police stood by and the prime minister turned a blind eye! Strange? Not at all. When 50,000 angry workers, students, and people from all walks of life held demonstrations in Tokyo, shouting slogans of "Down with the Ikeda Cabinet that killed Asanuma," it is clear that the Japanese people know who the mastermind is.
    In the face of the massive anti-American patriotic movement of the Japanese people, Kishi Nobusuke, the lackey of the United States, was forced to step down, and Ikeda appeared on the scene. This Ikeda once disguised himself, used flowery words, and tried every means to prove that he was different from Kishi Nobusuke in order to paralyze the Japanese people. However, the fox's tail cannot be hidden, and the reactionary's nature cannot be concealed. At a critical moment, the dagger is finally revealed, exposing his hideous, man-eating face. The despicable murder of Asanuma is a serious signal of a new offensive launched by this successor of Kishi Nobusuke and his master, U.S. imperialism, against the Japanese people.
    Why did the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries assassinate Asanuma on the eve of the election? This is because Asanuma had made important contributions to the cause of fighting for Japan's independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality, and because he had publicly pointed out that "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Japan and China" and "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Asia," which aroused the hatred of the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries. The more important reason they assassinated him was to obstruct the struggle of the Japanese people and intimidate the progressive democratic forces in Japan. As the Japanese Communist Party's statement said: "The dagger that assassinated Chairman Inejiro Asanuma is aimed at the workers, peasants, and all the Japanese people. This murder is the result of vicious instigation by reactionary forces who have a deep-seated hatred for the Japanese people's democratic movement for peace, independence, and neutrality."
    To carry out despicable assassinations is a common tactic used by all reactionaries. This does not prove the strength of the reactionaries, but on the contrary, shows their weakness. In the face of the surging tide of the people's struggle, they are frightened and uneasy. Their various sweet words and deceptive tricks are becoming increasingly ineffective, and all that remains are base acts such as assassination and shooting. In July 1946, the Kuomintang reactionaries in China used U.S.-made silenced pistols to kill patriotic democratic figures Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu. They also imagined that this despicable method could intimidate the people and suppress the struggle of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas for democracy. Things went in the opposite direction: the people were not intimidated, and the people's struggle was not suppressed, but became more vigorous. Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu fell, and more and more people joined the ranks of the struggle. The outcome is known to everyone.
    Now the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are also trying this trick, and their calculation is wrong. The Japanese people cannot be intimidated, and the anti-American patriotic struggle cannot be suppressed. Their despicable behavior will only make them lose popular support and arouse greater anger among the people. When one person falls, thousands upon thousands of people will unite more closely to carry out an unyielding struggle. The tide of struggle will rise higher and higher, and the slogans of struggle will be shouted louder and louder. The demonstration of 50,000 people in Tokyo is a prelude to a revolutionary storm!

    图穷匕首见
    易和元
    日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎在日本大选前夕遭到法西斯暴徒暗害。当凶手山口二矢行刺时，现场有许多便衣警察，还有许多自由民主党的警卫人员，但是他们没有一个人上前阻止他。据美联社报道：在穿着黑色学生服的山口二矢拿着一英尺长的刀向浅沼刺去的时候，池田首相和民主社会党领导人西尾在同一个讲台上几英尺以外的地方。
    在光天化日之下，在大庭广众之中，杀人犯竟能恣意行凶，而警察竟袖手旁观，首相竟视而不见！奇怪么？一点也不。东京五万名愤怒的工人、学生和各界人民举行示威游行时，高呼“打倒杀死浅沼的池田内阁”的口号，可见日本人民对谁是主谋是一清二楚的。
    在日本人民声势浩大的反美爱国运动面前，美国的奴才岸信介被迫下台了，池田粉墨登场。这个池田曾经乔装打扮，花言巧语，千方百计企图证别自己与岸信介有什么不同，用以麻痹日本人民。然而狐狸尾巴是藏不住的，反动派的本性是掩饰不了的，一到紧急关头，终于图穷匕首见，赤裸裸地露出了他狰狞的吃人的嘴脸。对浅沼的卑鄙谋杀，就是这个岸信介的继承人和他的主子美帝国主义向日本人民发动新的进攻的一个严重讯号。
    美日反动派为什么要在大选前夕刺杀浅沼呢？这是因为浅沼曾经为争取日本的独立、和平、民主、中立的事业作了重要的贡献，是因为他曾经公开指出：“美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人”，“美帝国主义是亚洲人民的共同敌人”，这引起了日美反动派的仇恨。他们之所以刺杀他，更重要的是想借此来阻挠日本人民的斗争，恫吓日本进步民主力量。正如日本共产党的声明所说的：“刺杀浅沼稻次郎委员长的匕首是针对着工人、农民和全体日本人民的。这次谋杀是反动势力恶毒唆使的结果，这些反动势力对日本人民争取和平、独立和中立的民主运动有着刻骨的仇恨。”
    实行卑鄙的暗杀，这是一切反动派惯用的手段。这不是证明反动派力量的强大，而是恰恰相反，说明了他们力量的弱小。在怒涛汹涌的人民斗争面前，他们胆战心惊，惶惶不安。他们的种种花言巧语，欺骗伎俩，已经越来越失效，剩下来的只有暗杀、枪杀一类卑劣行径。中国的国民党反动派在1946年7月，用美制的无声手枪杀害了爱国民主人士闻一多和李公朴。他们也曾设想用这种卑鄙的办法可以恫吓人民，压制蒋管区人民争取民主的斗争。事情走向它的反面：人民没有被吓着，人民的斗争不是压下去了，而是更加蓬勃高涨，闻一多、李公朴倒下去了，更多更多的人参加到斗争的行列里来。结局如何，那是大家都知道的。
    现在美日反动派也来这一手，他们的算盘打错了。日本人民恫吓不了，反美爱国的斗争压不下去。他们的这种卑鄙行为只会使自己更加丧失人心，激起人民更大的愤怒。一个人倒下去了，千千万万的人将会更紧密地团结起来进行不屈不挠的斗争，斗争的浪潮将会越掀越高，斗争的口号将会越喊越响亮，东京五万人的示威游行是革命大风暴的一个序幕！
