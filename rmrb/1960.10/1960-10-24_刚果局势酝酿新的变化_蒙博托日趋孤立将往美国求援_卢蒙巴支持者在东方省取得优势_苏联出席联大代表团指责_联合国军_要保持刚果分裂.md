Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: Leopoldville News: Mobutu, who launched a rebellion in the Congolese capital in September with the support of imperialism, announced on the 22nd that he would lead a "delegation" to New York on the 25th to seek support to maintain his waning control. He also said that as long as his safety was guaranteed, he would also go to London, Paris, and Brussels.

In Leopoldville, the Congolese capital, supporters of the Lumumba government have recently risen up in opposition to the Mobutu group. On the 20th, the governor of Leopoldville Province, Kamitatu, publicly condemned the Mobutu group's atrocities in Leopoldville and ordered it to cease all criminal activities. Faced with the increasingly strong opposition of the Congolese people, the Mobutu group's position has become increasingly unstable, and even its army is disobedient. Mobutu himself admitted that "he cannot control his army." The Associated Press lamented that "this pro-Western group is rapidly falling apart."

According to reports, Mobutu, fearing for his safety in recent days, has moved from the Leopoldville barracks to a military fortified area near Pinga in the suburbs and ordered the erection of barbed wire and machine gun positions outside his residence. News said that his new residence is guarded by his 300 "commandos" and a "UN force." At the same time, the Congolese garrison in Stanleyville, the capital of Orientale Province, recently crushed a conspiracy by the Mobutu traitor group to incite opposition to the Lumumba government. According to an Agence France-Presse report on the 22nd, Congolese troops in Stanleyville, under the orders of Congolese Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga of the Lumumba government, arrested Colonel Lokosa and two of his officers who were sent there by Mobutu's "instructions" to carry out conspiracies. News said that the Lumumba government has taken control of the situation in the Stanleyville area.

Prior to this, a small group of Mobutu's followers staged a rebellion in Stanleyville and, on Mobutu's orders, placed Jean Finant, the governor of Orientale Province who supported Prime Minister Lumumba, and Louis Lumumba (Prime Minister Lumumba's brother), the Minister of Interior of the provincial government, under house arrest. They also arrested Colonel Fataki of the gendarmerie, Prime Minister Lumumba's cousin.

Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: According to TASS, New York: The Soviet delegation to the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly issued a statement on the situation in the Republic of the Congo on the 21st, pointing out that the situation in the Congo is deteriorating.

In the Soviet delegation's statement, regret was expressed regarding the statement made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly on the 17th, pointing out that this statement did not provide a clear concept of the real situation in the Congo and did not mention how the UN forces command and the UN Secretary-General himself would correct the serious mistakes they had made in the Congo.

The statement said that the situation in the Republic of the Congo is deteriorating. Now the legitimate government of the Republic of the Congo has been completely deprived of all possibility of exercising its powers, and the head of this government, Lumumba, has in fact been placed under house arrest. The "UN forces" command and the UN Secretary-General are also trying to obstruct the convening of the Congolese parliament.

The statement also pointed out that recently, the "UN forces" command signed an agreement with the Katanga provincial authorities on dividing the province into so-called "defense zones," which is actually another step in recognizing the Tshombe bandit gang, which is confronting the legitimate government of the Republic of the Congo. It said that the "UN forces" command, for the benefit of the colonialists, is attempting to formally maintain the divided state of the Republic's territory.

The statement believes that the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly's emergency meeting on the Congo issue has been used by certain countries to achieve their selfish goals, and they have violated the Security Council's resolutions of July 14th and 22nd and August 9th this year. This is the reason why the situation in the Congo has not normalized, but has further deteriorated. The statement pointed out that this situation is a practical threat to universal peace and the security of all peoples.

The statement concluded by saying that if the highest body of the United Nations—the United Nations General Assembly—cannot advance the Congo situation in a direction that is conducive to peace, security, and the interests of the Congolese people, then it is demonstrating its incompetence before the world.

    刚果局势酝酿新的变化
    蒙博托日趋孤立将往美国求援　卢蒙巴支持者在东方省取得优势
    苏联出席联大代表团指责“联合国军”要保持刚果分裂
    新华社23日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：今年9月间在帝国主义支持下，在刚果首都发动叛乱的蒙博托22日宣布，他将于25日率领一个“代表团”前往纽约，寻求支持，以维持他在削弱中的控制。他还说，只要他的安全得到保障，他还将去伦敦、巴黎和布鲁塞尔。
    在刚果首都利奥波德维尔，最近以来，支持卢蒙巴政府的人纷纷起来反对蒙博托集团。20日，利奥波德维尔省省长卡米塔图公开谴责蒙博托集团在利奥波德维尔的暴行，并限令它停止一切犯罪活动。在刚果人民愈来愈强烈的反对下，蒙博托集团的地位已经愈来愈不稳，连它的军队也不听使唤了，蒙博托自己也承认“他无法控制他的军队”。美联社哀叹道，“这个亲西方集团迅速在分崩瓦解”。
    据报道，近日来，蒙博托由于害怕，已不敢在利奥波德维尔军营住宿，而搬到市郊平加附近的一个军事设防区内，并下令在他的住宅外面设立铁丝网和机枪阵地。消息说，他新的住宅由他的三百名“突击队”和一支“联合国军”守卫着。在这同时，刚果东方省省会斯坦利维尔的刚果驻军，最近粉碎了蒙博托叛国集团企图煽动反对卢蒙巴政府的阴谋。据法新社22日报道，斯坦利维尔的刚果军队根据刚果卢蒙巴政府副总理基赞加的命令，逮捕了奉蒙博托的“指示”到那里进行阴谋活动的洛科萨上校和他手下的两个军官。消息说，卢蒙巴政府已控制了斯坦利维尔地区的局势。
    在这以前，一小撮蒙博托的追随者在斯坦利维尔进行叛乱，并且奉蒙博托之命软禁了支持卢蒙巴总理的东方省省长让·菲南和省政府的内政部长路易·卢蒙巴（卢蒙巴总理的兄弟），同时还在那里逮捕了卢蒙巴的表兄弟宪兵部队的法塔基上校。
    据新华社22日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联出席联合国大会第十五届会议代表团21日发表关于刚果共和国局势问题的声明，指出刚果局势越来越恶化。
  苏联代表团的声明里，对于联合国秘书长17日在联合国大会全体会议上发表的声明表示遗憾，指出这个声明没有对刚果真正局势提供明确的概念，并且只字未提联合国军司令部和联合国秘书长本人如何来纠正他们在刚果所犯的严重错误。
    声明说，刚果共和国的局势越来越恶化了。现在刚果共和国的合法政府完全被剥夺了履行自己职权的一切可能性，这个政府的首脑卢蒙巴实际上也被软禁起来。“联合国军”司令部和联合国秘书长还竭力阻挠召开刚果议会。
    声明还指出，最近“联合国军”司令部同加丹加省当局签订了一项关于在该省分成所谓“防御区”的协议，这实际上是承认与刚果共和国合法政府对抗的冲伯匪帮的又一步骤。它说，“联合国军”司令部为了殖民主义者的利益，企图正式保持共和国领土分裂的状况。
    声明认为，联合国大会紧急会议关于刚果问题的决议被某些国家用来达到它们的自私的目的，它们违反了安全理事会今年7月14日和22日以及8月9日的决议。这是造成刚果局势不是正常化，而是进一步恶化的原因。声明指出，这种局势是对普遍和平和各国人民安全的实际威胁。
    声明最后说，如果联合国最高机构——联合国大会不能使刚果局势朝有利于和平、安全，有利于刚果人民的方向进展，那么它就在全世界面前表明自己是无能的。
