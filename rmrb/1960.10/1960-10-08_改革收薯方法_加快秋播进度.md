The Houyang Village Production Team Implements "Digging Potatoes and Plowing the Land in One Go, Harvesting Autumn and Planting Wheat in One Stroke" - 400 Mu of Sweet Potato Stubble Wheat Saves Over 600 Workdays, Wheat Planting Task Can be Completed Seven Days Early

(Our newspaper, Tianjin, 7th dispatch) The Houyang Village Production Team of Longwangmiao Commune, Daming County, Hebei Province, adopted the method of "digging potatoes and plowing the land in one go, harvesting autumn and planting wheat in one stroke," which solved the contradiction of insufficient labor. This made autumn harvesting work meticulous and good, and wheat sowing early, fast, and good.

Under the guidance of the idea of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, this team actively expanded the sweet potato planting area. This year, the team planted a total of 580 mu of spring and summer sweet potatoes, accounting for 70% of the total area of food crops. Due to the doubled expansion of sweet potato planting area and its good growth, harvesting and digging became labor-intensive, and stubble removal was delayed. This brought a new contradiction to timely planting sufficient wheat.

This year, the specific situation here is: the team's 650 mu wheat planting task requires 410 mu to be planted on sweet potato stubble land. Because sweet potato harvesting and digging are relatively labor-intensive, and wheat is a crop that must be well-planted to have a good start, this makes things even busier. The team is short of 477 laborers during the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing, and planting) period. According to the existing labor and animal power arrangements, the team will only be able to complete the potato digging and wheat planting tasks three days after "Frost's Descent" (a solar term, around October 23rd). In order to solve this problem, the team's Party branch, with the help of Sun Zhiyong, the first secretary of the commune's Party committee, and Wang Zhongchang, the deputy secretary, found a way to both harvest autumn well and plant wheat well through convening old farmers' symposiums and mobilizing the masses to summarize the experience of the first team's successful wheat harvest on sweet potato stubble land. This method was "digging potatoes and plowing the land in one go, harvesting autumn and planting wheat in one stroke."

The specific content of "digging potatoes and plowing the land in one go, harvesting autumn and planting wheat in one stroke" is: gather leaves while harvesting, cut seedlings while harvesting, rake leaves while harvesting, spread manure while harvesting, dig potatoes and plow the land at the same time, deliver manure and transport potatoes at the same time, harrow in time to preserve soil moisture, and prepare the land quickly for sowing. In this way, digging potatoes is combined with plowing the potato field, reducing one process and changing the old practice of digging all the potatoes first, then sending manure, plowing, and sowing. The specific arrangements for each process are: Gather: Before harvesting potatoes, organize auxiliary labor and children to gather potato leaves, ensuring that stems and leaves are gathered completely and dried; Cut: After the potato leaves are gathered, immediately cut off the potato seedlings and dry them for storage; Rake: After cutting the seedlings, immediately rake the fallen leaves on the ground; Apply: After raking the leaves, immediately spread manure, ensuring that 12,000 catties of crude fertilizer are applied per mu; Dig: After spreading the manure, start digging, and change the old habit of only digging potato piles, ensuring that the entire field is dug without leaving raw ridges, and the plowing depth reaches seven to eight inches; Pick: Pick while digging, ensuring that everything is picked cleanly and well; Transport: Combine the delivery of manure with the transportation of potato tubers, so that commune members do not return empty-handed and vehicles do not travel empty; Harrow: After the potato tubers are dug and picked up, harrow in time, harrow four to six times, level and compact the soil, and preserve soil moisture; Prepare: Level the land to achieve garden-style planting; Sow: After harrowing and leveling, sow in time, planting all the wheat at the appropriate time.

In order to ensure the work quality of each process, the method of fixed responsibility and assembly line operation was adopted. The team's 183 laborers and 75 auxiliary laborers, according to the lightness, heaviness, simplicity, and complexity of each process, formed ten work groups, and implemented the "seven-fixed" responsibility system of fixing leaders, fixing labor, fixing tasks, fixing time, fixing quality, fixing work points, and fixing rewards. Because all agricultural work was implemented with quota production and excess rewards, the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the commune members were greatly stimulated. In order to ensure the quality of harvesting and planting, in addition to the five-person acceptance team led by Wang Kezhang, the deputy secretary of the Party branch, who conducted timely inspections and acceptance block by block and ridge by ridge, all work groups were mobilized to supervise each other to ensure the quality of agricultural work. At the same time, a "three-comparison" competition was launched between teams, groups, and individuals to compare enthusiasm, compare progress, and compare quality. Through carrying out large-scale evaluation and competition, the team's potato harvesting and wheat planting progress increased from 17 mu per day to 33 mu per day. All 130 mu of spring potatoes have been harvested and planted with wheat.

From the actual results, it can be seen that adopting the above method has the following advantages: First, because agricultural work is compact and interspersed, it saves time and labor, and solves the contradiction between the concentration of "Three Autumns" agricultural work and the shortage of labor and animal power. According to preliminary calculations, 1.6 workdays can be saved per mu, and a total of more than 600 workdays can be saved for the team's more than 400 mu of sweet potato stubble wheat. Second, the land is plowed deeply and finely, without leaving raw ridges, all reaching more than seven inches. Third, after adopting the method of digging potatoes and plowing the land in one go, the loss of soil moisture due to stubble exposure is avoided. Fourth, the implementation of this method accelerates the progress and brings forward the sowing period of late-stubble wheat. The team can complete the wheat planting task seven days early.

### 改革收薯方法　加快秋播进度

    改革收薯方法　加快秋播进度
    后杨村生产队实行“刨薯翻地一遍成，收秋种麦一条龙”四百亩甘薯茬小麦省工六百多个，种麦任务可提前七天完成
    本报天津7日电　河北省大名县龙王庙公社后杨村生产队，采取“刨薯翻地一遍成，收秋种麦一条龙”的办法，解决了劳力不足的矛盾，使秋收工作又细又好，小麦播种又早、又快、又好。
    在大办农业，大办粮食的思想指导下，这个队积极扩大了甘薯种植面积，今年全队共种春、夏薯五百八十亩，占粮食作物总面积的70％。由于甘薯种植面积的成倍扩大，生长得好，因而收刨费工，腾茬较晚。这就给适时种好种足小麦带来一个新的矛盾。
    今年这里的具体情况是：全队六百五十亩种麦任务，有四百一十亩需要种在甘薯茬地上。因为甘薯收刨比较费工，小麦又是一种“胎里富”的作物，必须种好，这样就更是忙上加忙。全队在“三秋”期间缺劳力四百七十七名，按现有的劳力、畜力安排，全队在“霜降”后三天才能完成刨薯和种麦任务。为了解决这个问题，这个队党支部在公社党委第一书记孙志勇和副书记王仲常的帮助下，通过召集老农座谈，发动群众总结去年第一小队薯茬种麦获得丰收的经验，找到了
  “刨薯翻地一遍成，收秋种麦一条龙”，既收好秋，又种好麦的办法。
      “刨薯翻地一遍成，收秋种麦一条龙”的具体内容是：随采叶、随割秧、随搂叶、随撒粪，刨薯带翻地，送粪带运薯，随时耙耢保好墒，随整土地快播种。这样，刨薯兼翻了薯地，减少了一道工序，改变了过去先刨完薯再送粪、翻地和播种的老规矩。各个工序的具体安排是：采：在收薯前，组织辅助劳力和儿童进行采薯叶，做到了梗叶齐采，采净晒干；割：把薯叶采净后，随即割掉薯秧晒干储存；搂：割秧后随即搂净地下的落叶；施：把叶搂净后，随即撒粪，每亩保证施到一万二千斤粗肥；刨：撒好粪以后就收刨，并改变过去光刨薯堆的老习惯，做到遍地收刨，不留生埂，刨翻的深度达到七至八寸；拾：前边刨，后边拾，保证拾净拾好；运：结合送粪拉运薯块，社员来回不空手，车辆来回不空走；耙：把薯块刨净、拾净以后，及时进行耙耢，普耙四至六遍，耙平耙实，保住地墒；整：平整土地，实现种植园田化；播：耙耢平整好以后，及时播种，全部种成应时麦。
    为了保证各个工序的工作质量，采取了固定责任，流水作业的方法。全队一百八十三名劳力和七十五名辅助劳力，根据各个工序的活计轻重与繁简，分别组成了十个作业小组，推行了定领导、定劳力、定任务、定时间、定质量、定工分、定奖励的“七定”责任制。由于样样农活都实行了定额生产，超额奖励，大大激发了社员的积极性和责任心。为了保证收、种质量，除了以党支部副书记王克章为主组成了五人验收小组，及时进行逐块、逐垅检查验收以外，还发动各个作业小组进行互相监督，保证了农活质量。同时，还开展了队与队、组与组、人与人之间比干劲、比进度、比质量的“三比”竞赛运动。通过大搞评比竞赛，全队收薯、种麦进度由原来日刨十七亩，增加到三十三亩，全队一百三十亩春薯已全部收刨完，种上了麦。
    从实际效果可以看出，采取上述办法有这样几个好处：一、由于农活紧凑，穿插进行，节省了时间、劳力，解决了“三秋”农活集中与劳力和畜力不足的矛盾。经过初步计算，每亩可节省一点六个工，全队四百多亩甘薯茬小麦，共节省用工六百多个。二、土地翻的深、翻的细，不留生埂，都达到了七寸以上。三、采取了刨薯翻地一遍成的办法后，避免了晾茬跑墒。四、实行这种办法，加快了进度，提早了晚茬麦的播种期，全队可提早七天完成种麦任务。
