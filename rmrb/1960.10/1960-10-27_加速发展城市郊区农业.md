Accelerating the Development of Suburban Agriculture

In the nationwide movement of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, cities bear glorious and important tasks. On the one hand, cities should support agriculture in terms of agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, technical personnel, science, and technology. On the other hand, cities should accelerate the development of suburban agriculture and produce more grain and non-staple foods. Because China's large and medium-sized cities have considerable suburban areas and enormous potential, the task of developing urban suburban agriculture is becoming increasingly urgent.

Our cities are new-style socialist cities. Our cities not only have concentrated industries, commerce, transportation, and cultural and educational undertakings, but also have large suburban agricultural areas. While developing industry, commerce, and cultural and educational undertakings, cities should strive to develop agriculture and actively strive for partial self-sufficiency, basic self-sufficiency, or even complete self-sufficiency in non-staple foods and grain. This is a strategic measure taken by our party during socialist construction. As everyone knows, cities are major consumers of grain and non-staple foods. In old China, cities like Shanghai needed supplies of non-staple foods from many provinces. Cities like Chongqing needed pork and vegetables from dozens of counties. At that time, the urban population was small, and the living standards of the vast majority of working people in the cities were very low. In the context of urban-rural opposition and urban exploitation of rural areas, farmers were forced to bring grain and non-staple foods to the cities, making it relatively easy to meet the needs of the few wealthy people in the cities. Since liberation, the original consumer cities have become producer cities, and many new cities have emerged. The urban population has increased rapidly, and urban consumption patterns have undergone fundamental changes. Take Beijing as an example. Before liberation, it was a typical consumer city. In 1949, the total industrial and handicraft output value of the city was only 170 million yuan, with only 70,000 industrial workers and 430,000 employed people, and unemployment was extremely serious. By 1959, the industrial and handicraft output value of this new-style socialist city reached 6.8 billion yuan, which was 40 times that of 1949. Unemployment has been eliminated, and the average number of employed people per household has reached 2.3, with basically all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied people between the ages of 16 and 60 employed. The number of students in primary, middle, and universities has increased to 1.35 million. The large increase in the employed population and the gradual increase in workers' wages have led to a substantial increase in social purchasing power. Things that only a few wealthy people could enjoy in the past have now become a common need of the broad masses of people. In this case, if all the grain and non-staple foods needed by the city are still completely dependent on the supply from rural areas far and near, as in the past, it will not only be impossible to meet the needs of the city in a short period of time, but also uneconomical and unreasonable from the perspective of the country's economic layout. Developing suburban agriculture and relying on the superior conditions of the suburbs can provide a large amount of non-staple foods relatively quickly to meet the growing needs of the city. This allows the vast rural areas to concentrate their efforts, make overall arrangements, and provide the city with sufficient grain and industrial raw materials. This is of great benefit to promoting the economic construction of the entire country and also plays an extremely important role in forming a rational socialist economic layout.

In recent years, urban suburban areas in China have gradually expanded, and suburban agriculture has developed rapidly. According to statistics from 55 large and medium-sized cities including Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Shenyang, by the end of May of this year, the vegetable planting area had increased by 34.1% compared to the end of June last year, the number of live pigs had increased by 32.8%, and the number of poultry had increased by 31.5%. In 1959, Beijing produced 1.6 billion catties of vegetables, an increase of 60% over 1958, and this year there has been a substantial increase compared to last year. Some cities have not only achieved self-sufficiency in non-staple foods, but also have reserves and can support other areas. The development of urban suburban agriculture has played an important role in ensuring the lives of urban people and the supply of some industrial raw materials, and has also promoted the development of urban industry. Cities have vigorously supported suburban areas in achieving mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification, which has also promoted the development of suburban agriculture. As suburban agriculture develops, the accumulation of people's communes increases, and the material and cultural life of the commune members improves. Through mutual support, the relationship between workers and peasants becomes closer. It can be seen that the development of suburban agriculture has far-reaching significance for promoting the development of industry and agriculture, narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

Can suburban agriculture develop more rapidly? Judging from the fact that many cities have achieved basic or partial self-sufficiency in major non-staple foods such as vegetables, pork, and poultry within one or two years, it is possible to develop more rapidly. Suburban areas have many superior conditions for accelerating the development of agriculture that are not available in general rural areas. Suburban areas are close to cities, with convenient transportation, fertile land, and a relatively solid foundation for farmland capital construction. Cities have strong industrial and material conditions and can equip suburban agriculture with material and technical forces. Urban suburban commerce is concentrated and closely linked to industry, and the supply of means of production and means of livelihood is more adequate and timely. Cities concentrate a large number of scientific research institutions and scientific and technological departments, which can better help suburban areas carry out scientific research and apply advanced science and technology to production in a timely manner. Cities have a dense population and can also provide necessary labor support (such as spring plowing, autumn harvesting, and resisting natural disasters). Cities have abundant fertilizer sources, which is a unique advantage for suburban agriculture. As long as these superior conditions are fully and appropriately utilized, suburban agriculture will inevitably develop more rapidly.

Urban suburban areas are divided into near suburbs and distant suburbs. Near suburbs should supply the city with a large amount of non-staple foods on the basis of grain self-sufficiency. In addition to supplying the city with non-staple foods, distant suburbs must also supply the city with the grain it needs. Therefore, suburban agricultural production should be based on grain and focus on non-staple foods. The sign of doing a good job in suburban agriculture is to give equal importance to grain, vegetables, pigs, and oil, and gradually achieve self-sufficiency in non-staple foods on the basis of producing as much grain as possible. Grain is the foundation for developing all non-staple food production. With grain, there is feed; with livestock, there is meat; with fertilizer, it can be used to develop the production of grain, vegetables, and oil. On the other hand, grasping the production of non-staple foods can promote the overall development of suburban agriculture. Growing vegetables is agriculture, raising pigs, cattle, chickens, and ducks is animal husbandry, aquaculture is fisheries, and producing fruits is forestry. Raising livestock, poultry, and fish requires planting feed, which is also agriculture. Animal husbandry requires pastures and forest land, which is also forestry. It can be seen that as long as we take grain as the key link and vigorously grasp the production of non-staple foods, we can promote the simultaneous development of all five industries and promote each other.

Reasonably arranging labor and fully exploiting the potential of suburban land are two important links in accelerating the development of suburban agriculture. Suburban labor must be used for industrial construction and for developing agriculture; within agriculture, we must vigorously develop grain and vigorously develop non-staple food production. If the arrangements are improper and the labor is used in a dispersed manner, it will have an adverse impact on the development of industry and agriculture. In order to solve this problem, urban industry should fully tap its internal potential, vigorously carry out technological revolution and technological innovation, and implement "increase production without increasing manpower" and "increase production while reducing manpower." At present, it should not only refrain from transferring labor from suburban areas, but also transfer some labor to support agriculture. Within agriculture, we must also divide the battle lines and do everything possible to ensure the needs of the front line. When arranging labor, suburban people's communes should not only pay attention to strengthening labor management, but also strive to implement tool reforms and accelerate mechanization, which is the fundamental way to solve the labor problem. There is a lot of female labor in suburban areas, so we should do a good job in labor protection and fully mobilize their enthusiasm. Suburban land is concentrated and the area is not large. The rational use of land between industry and agriculture, and between various industries within agriculture, is an important issue. Basic construction in suburban areas will inevitably occupy some cultivated land. The departments in charge of basic construction must make careful calculations, try every means to save land, occupy it later rather than sooner, occupy less rather than more, and try to occupy bad land and occupy less flat and good land. Within agriculture, we must vigorously tap potential, widely implement intercropping and intercropping, and use scattered small pieces of land to vigorously develop "ten-side" additional planting to achieve the purpose of multiple planting and multiple harvesting.

Accelerating the development of suburban agriculture is the business of the vast number of peasants in suburban areas, and it is also the business of all walks of life in the city. Therefore, the key to accelerating the development of suburban agriculture lies in further strengthening the leadership of the Party and mobilizing all positive factors. According to the experience of some cities in Sichuan, the first requirement is that the urban Party committee implement overall planning and grasp industry and agriculture in an all-round way. It is necessary to equip the agricultural front with sufficient leadership and cadre strength, establish necessary institutions, formulate plans for developing suburban agriculture in a very good manner, and resolutely implement them. The Party committee must vigorously grasp ideological and political work, educate cadres to establish lofty ambitions, and strive to promote suburban agriculture to an advanced level in a short period of time. It is also necessary to strengthen ideological education work according to the characteristics of suburban areas, use the rapid development of urban and suburban industrial construction and the gradual improvement of people's living standards to illustrate the importance of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, call on the masses to love rural people's communes, establish the idea that agricultural labor is glorious, and strive to develop suburban agricultural production. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, urban industry, commerce, transportation, and cultural and educational undertakings should formulate plans to support suburban agriculture, widely promote the practice of mutual pairing, counterpart contracting, and all-inclusive contracting, focusing on supporting the mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification of suburban areas, and participate in the development of suburban agriculture in terms of technology, equipment, talent, labor, and so on.

Currently, it is the busy season of the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing), and cities must mobilize all forces to support the "Three Autumns" work in suburban areas. For example, mobilizing some urban workers, students, and cadres from government offices to go to the countryside to help suburban areas with autumn harvesting, collecting more urban fertilizer to send to the countryside, and supplying suburban areas with more and better "Three Autumns" tools in a timely manner, and so on. Urban suburban areas should carefully harvest the autumn crops, sow wheat well, and strengthen field management of autumn vegetables. At the same time, they should prepare for winter vegetable production to ensure that there are enough vegetables to supply the city during the spring vegetable off-season. This year, many urban suburban areas have implemented intercropping of grain and vegetables, planting a season of vegetables in wheat fields, which has not only expanded the grain production area, but also increased vegetable production. This method is worth learning from in various places. Arrangements for next year's suburban agricultural production should be planned as early as possible, and more urban forces should be mobilized to support rural areas, so as to strive for greater development in suburban agricultural production next year.

    加速发展城市郊区农业
    在大办农业、大办粮食的全民运动中，城市担负着极为光荣、重大的任务。一方面，城市要在农业机械、化学肥料、农药、技术人才、科学技术等等方面支援农业；一方面，城市应该加速发展郊区农业，生产更多的粮食和副食品。由于我国的大中城市都有相当大的郊区，都有非常大的潜力，因此，发展城市郊区农业的任务越来越迫切了。
    我们的城市是社会主义的新型城市。我们的城市不仅有集中的工业、商业、交通运输和文化教育事业，而且有较大的郊区农业。城市在发展工业、商业、文化教育事业的同时，努力发展农业，积极争取副食品和粮食的部分自给、基本自给以至完全自给，这是我们党在社会主义建设期间采取的一项具有战略意义的措施。大家知道，城市是粮食和副食品的大消费者。在旧中国，像上海这样的城市所需要的副食品，要许多省区来供应；像重庆这样的城市所需要的猪肉和蔬菜，也要几十个县来供应。当时城市人口不多，城市里绝大多数劳动人民的生活水平又非常低，在城乡对立、城市剥削农村的情况下，农民被迫把粮食和副食品拿到城市来，比较容易满足城市里少数富有者的需要。解放以来，原有的消费城市变成了生产城市，同时出现了许多新的城市。城市人口迅速增加，城市消费状况发生了根本的变化。以北京市为例。在解放前，这是一个典型的消费城市。1949年全市工业、手工业总产值只有一亿七千万元，产业工人只有七万人，就业人口只有四十三万人，失业现象极为严重。到1959年，这个社会主义新型城市的工业、手工业总产值达到六十八亿元，等于1949年的四十倍。失业现象消灭了，每户平均就业人口达到二点三人，从十六岁到六十岁的劳动力、半劳动力，基本上都就业了。大、中、小学学生增加到一百三十五万人。就业人口的大量增加，职工工资的逐步提高，引起社会购买力的大幅度增长。过去只有少数富有者才能享受的东西，现在已经变成广大人民的普遍需要。在这种情况下，如果城市需要的一切粮食和副食品，还跟过去一样，完全依靠远远近近的农村来供应，不仅短时期内无法满足城市的需要，而且是不经济的，从国家的经济布局来说也是不合理的。发展郊区农业，依靠郊区的优越条件，可以比较迅速地大量地提供副食品，满足城市日益增长的需要。而让广大农村集中力量，全面安排，为城市提供足够的粮食和工业原料。这对推动整个国家的经济建设有很大好处，对形成社会主义的合理的经济布局也有极大的作用。
    几年以来，我国城市郊区逐步扩大，郊区农业日益发展。据上海、武汉、重庆、沈阳等五十五个大中城市统计，到今年5月末，蔬菜种植面积比去年6月末增加34.1％，生猪存栏数增加32.8％，家禽增长31.5％。北京市1959年生产的蔬菜达到十六亿斤，比1958年增长60％，今年比去年又有大幅度的增长。有些城市不仅作到副食品自给，而且有了储备，并能支援外地。城市郊区农业的发展，对保证城市人民生活和部分工业原料的供应，起了重大作用，又推进了城市工业的发展。城市大力支援郊区实现机械化、水利化和电气化，又推动了郊区农业的发展。郊区农业发展了，人民公社的积累增加了，社员物质、文化生活提高了；通过互相支援，工人和农民的感情更加亲密了。由此可见，发展郊区农业，对促进工农业发展，缩小城乡差别，巩固工农联盟都有极为深远的意义。
    郊区农业能不能更迅速地发展呢？从许多城市在一两年内就作到了蔬菜、猪肉、家禽等主要副食品基本自给或部分自给的情况来看，是能够更迅速发展的。郊区加速发展农业，有许多为一般农村所没有的优越条件。郊区紧靠城市，交通方便，土地肥沃，农田基本建设较有基础；城市具有强大的工业和物质条件，能够以物质力量和技术力量来装备郊区农业；城市郊区商业集中，和工业联系紧密，生产资料和生活资料的供应更能充分和及时；城市集中着大量科学研究机构和科学技术部门，能更好地帮助郊区开展科学研究工作，把先进科学技术及时用于生产；城市人口稠密，还能进行必要的劳力支援（如春耕、秋收、抗御自然灾害等）；城市肥源丰富，更是郊区农业得天独厚的条件。只要充分地、适当地运用这些优越的条件，郊区农业必然可以更加迅速地发展起来。
    城市郊区有近郊区和远郊区之分。近郊区应该在粮食自给的基础上，供给城市大量副食品。远郊区除了供给城市副食品外，还要供给城市需要的粮食。因此，郊区农业生产，应以粮食为基础，以副食品为中心环节。搞好郊区农业的标志是粮、菜、猪、油并举，在尽量多地生产粮食的基础上，逐步实现副食品自给。粮食是发展一切副食品生产的基础。有了粮食，就有了饲料；有了牲畜，就有了肉食；有了肥料，就可以用来发展粮、菜、油的生产。另一方面，抓紧副食品生产又可以促进郊区农业全面发展。种植蔬菜是农业，养猪、养牛、养鸡鸭是畜牧业，水产是渔业，生产果品是林业；喂养家畜、家禽和鱼要种植饲料，这又是农业；畜牧业需要草场、林地，这又是林业。由此可见，只要以粮为纲，大抓副食品生产，就能推动五业并举，互相促进。
    合理安排劳动力，充分发挥郊区土地潜力，是加速发展郊区农业的两个重要环节。郊区劳动力既要用于工业建设，又要发展农业；在农业内部，既要大搞粮食，又要大搞副食品生产。如果安排不当，分散使用，就会给工农业的发展带来不利的影响。为了解决这个问题，城市工业应该充分发掘内部潜力，大搞技术革命和技术革新，实行“增产不增人”，“增产还减人”，目前不仅不能从郊区抽调劳动力，而且还要抽调一部分劳动力去支援农业。农业内部也要划分战线，尽一切可能保证第一线需要。郊区人民公社安排劳力的时候，除了注意加强劳动管理以外，还要努力实行工具改革，加快机械化，这是解决劳动力问题的根本途径。郊区妇女劳力多，应该做好劳动保护工作，充分调动她们的积极性。郊区土地集中，面积不大，工农之间、农业内部各业之间合理使用土地，是一个重要问题。在郊区进行基本建设，势必占用一些耕地；主管基本建设的部门，必须精打细算，千方百计节约用地，能晚占就不早占，能少占就不多占，而且要尽量占用坏地，少占平地和好地。在农业内部，要大力发掘潜力，广泛实行套作、间作，并利用零星小块土地大搞“十边”增种，以达到多种多收的目的。
    加速发展郊区农业，是郊区广大农民的事情，也是城市各行各业的事情。因此，加速发展郊区农业的关键，在于进一步加强党的领导，调动一切积极因素。根据四川一些城市的经验，首先要求城市党委实行全面规划，把工业、农业全面抓起来。一定要在农业战线上配备足够的领导力量和干部力量，建立必要的机构；很好地制订发展郊区农业的计划，坚决贯彻执行。党委要大抓思想政治工作，教育干部树立雄心大志，争取在短期内把郊区农业推进到先进水平；还要根据郊区的特点，加强思想教育工作，用城市和郊区工业建设迅速发展、人民生活水平逐步提高的事实，说明大办农业、大办粮食的重要性，号召群众热爱农村人民公社，树立农业劳动光荣的思想，努力发展郊区农业生产。城市工业、商业、交通运输和文化教育事业，要在党委统一领导下，订出支援郊区农业的规划，广泛推广相互挂钩、对口包干、一包到底的作法，以支援郊区机械化、水利化和电气化为中心，从技术、设备、人才、劳力等等方面，参加发展郊区农业。
    当前，正是三秋大忙时节，城市要动员各方面的力量支援郊区的三秋工作。例如，动员一部分城市职工、学生和机关干部下乡帮助郊区秋收，收集更多的城肥下乡，及时供应郊区更多更好的三秋工具，等等。城市郊区要认真收好秋，种好麦，抓紧秋菜田间管理，同时准备冬季蔬菜生产，保证在明春蔬菜淡季有足够的蔬菜供应城市。今年不少城市郊区实行粮菜间作，在小麦地里种了一季蔬菜，既扩大了粮食生产面积，也增加了蔬菜产量，这种办法值得各地参考。关于明年郊区农业生产的安排，更要及早作出规划，动员更多的城市力量支援农村，争取明年郊区农业生产能够得到更大的发展。
