    Hunan Overfulfills Its Pig Iron Transfer Plan
    The iron plants and transportation departments of Hunan Province are working closely together to accelerate the transfer of pig iron to support key steel plants across the country. In order to do a good job in transferring iron, the Provincial Party Committee transferred more than 100 cadres to form several work groups, which went deep into key iron transfer areas to assist and supervise the work. In the spirit of "getting ahead, not lagging behind," various localities have fixed more than 180 trucks, 20,000 ox carts and horse carts, and 50,000 tons of wooden sailboats to undertake short-distance collection and transportation work. In the transfer process, the iron plants assisted the transportation departments with loading and unloading; the transportation departments took the initiative to contact the iron plants to jointly arrange transfer plans and simplify transfer procedures; the transportation departments also closely cooperated with each other, breaking down regional boundaries. Thanks to the close cooperation of all parties, the province overfulfilled its iron transfer plan by 8% in August and by 42.5% in September. The iron transfer plan arranged for October increased by more than 5.9% compared with September, and they are also striving to complete the annual iron transfer plan one month or one and a half months ahead of schedule.

    Anshan Iron and Steel No. 1 Steel Plant Establishes Team Collaboration Conventions
    The Anshan Iron and Steel No. 1 Steel Plant has widely mobilized the masses to establish team collaboration conventions, fixing the communist-style collaboration between production processes, between furnaces, and between teams and individuals in the form of conventions. The benefits are: making the realization of production plans truly based on the masses' conscious labor and overall collaboration, promoting close connection between all links of production, and better absorbing the masses to participate in enterprise management. As a result of the implementation, the production potential of many teams has been fully exploited. For example, in the five days from October 5th to 10th, the first five processes of Team B, which established the convention earliest, were shortened by an average of 50 minutes compared to October 1st to 5th, creating favorable conditions for rapid steelmaking.

    Fujian Successfully Cokes with Local Coal
    Workers at the Sanming Iron and Steel Plant in Fujian successfully experimented with coking using local coal, and have explored a relatively complete set of operating methods in coal washing, coal pulverization, coal blending, testing, compaction, kiln modification, sealing, and fire watching, paving the way for the rapid development of coking production in the province. Currently, the ash content of washed coal is generally below 12%, the volatile matter after coal blending is around 16%, and the strength of coke has reached 78.81%. Recently, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting at the plant to promote their experience in coking with local coal.

    Nanma Iron Plant Roasts Ore at the Mine
    The Nanma Iron and Steel Plant in Yiyuan County, Shandong Province, moved the raw material processing workshop to the iron ore area, using natural terrain to build large furnaces and material sheds, implementing ore dressing and roasting at the mine site. This not only ensures the need for ore for steel production, but also greatly saves transportation power and labor required for raw material processing, reducing ore costs by 23%.

    High-Efficiency, Fuel-Saving Model Worker Wang Shusen
    Wang Shusen, a national advanced producer and driver at the Magongzhuang Motor Transport Depot of the Beijing Transportation Company, has worked hard to learn and study high-efficiency and fuel-saving experience. While striving for high efficiency, he has tried every possible means to save gasoline bit by bit. Over the past four years, he has not only overfulfilled his tasks month after month and year after year, and his transportation efficiency has been rising steadily, creating a new record of 10,000 ton-kilometers per ton-day for short-distance transportation vehicles in the city's road transportation sector, but has also saved nearly 10,000 liters of gasoline, becoming an outstanding model worker on the city's transportation front who is both high-yielding and fuel-efficient.

    湖南外调生铁超额完成计划
    湖南省铁厂和运输部门紧密协作，加速外调生铁，支援全国重点钢厂。为了做好调铁工作，省委抽调了百余名干部组成若干个工作组，深入重点调铁地区协助和督促工作。各地本着赶前不赶后的精神，固定了一百八十多部汽车、两万多辆牛马车和五万多吨木帆船，担任短途集运工作。在调运工作中，铁厂协助运输部门装卸；运输部门主动与铁厂联系，共同安排调运计划，简化调运手续；运输部门之间也紧密配合，打破地区界限。由于各方的紧密协作，全省8月份超额8％完成调铁计划，9月份又超额42.5％完成调铁任务。10月份安排的调铁计划比9月又增长5.9％以上，他们还力争提前一个月或一个半月完成全年调铁计划。
    鞍钢一炼钢厂订班组协作公约
    鞍钢第一炼钢厂普遍发动群众订立班组协作公约，把各生产工序之间、炉子之间、班组和个人之间的共产主义大协作，用公约形式固定下来。它的好处是：使生产计划的实现真正建立在群众自觉劳动和一盘棋大协作的基础上，促进生产各个环节紧密衔接，更好地吸收群众参加企业管理。推行的结果，许多班组生产潜力得到了充分的发挥。如最早订立公约的乙班，10月5日到10日的五天中，前五道工序时间比10月1日至5日平均缩短了五十分钟，为快速炼钢创造了有利条件。
    福建用本省煤炼焦成功
    福建三明钢铁厂职工用本省煤炼焦试验成功，并且在洗煤、粉煤、配煤、化验、压紧、改窑、密封、看火等方面摸索出一套较完整的操作方法，为迅速发展本省炼焦生产开辟了道路。现在洗煤灰分一般已低于12％，配煤后的挥发分在16％左右，焦炭的强度已达到78.81％。最近，中共福建省委在这个厂召开了现场会议，推广他们用本省煤炼焦的经验。
    南麻铁厂到矿山焙烧矿石
    山东沂源县南麻钢铁厂将原料加工车间搬到铁矿区，利用自然地形建大炉、盖料棚，实行就矿选矿，就矿焙烧，不仅保证了钢铁生产对矿石的需要，同时还大大节约了运输力量和原料加工所需要的劳动力，使矿石成本下降了23％。
