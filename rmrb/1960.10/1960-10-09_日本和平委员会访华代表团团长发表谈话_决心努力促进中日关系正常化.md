Xinhua News Agency, 8th - Kenjiro Yanagida, head of the visiting delegation of the Japanese Peace Committee to China, told Xinhua reporters in Beijing on the 7th that the Japanese people will, on the basis of past struggles, fight with greater strength to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security" Treaty. He said: "The past struggle was just a prelude. The real struggle is only now beginning." After recounting the great victory of the Japanese people in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security" Treaty, Yanagida Kenjiro said that one of the greatest gains of this struggle was the formation of a united front. He said: "This was an important issue for Japanese progressives for fifteen years, and it was finally resolved through this struggle. We must protect it like our own eyes and make it grow stronger."

Yanagida Kenjiro said that it would be wrong for the Japanese people to forget that imperialism is the real enemy of the Japanese people in their struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security" Treaty and not dare to wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism. It would also be wrong to feel pessimistic and disappointed and to relax the will to fight, thinking that although the Kishi Nobusuke government has been overthrown, U.S. imperialism has not been overthrown, and instead the Ikeda government, which replaced Kishi Nobusuke, has emerged.

This famous Japanese peace activist said: A very gratifying phenomenon in the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security" Treaty is the growth of the strength of the Japanese Communist Party. He said: "The Communist Party has increasingly penetrated the hearts of the workers, and the number of people asking to join the Party is constantly increasing in the struggle."

Speaking of his impressions of his visit to China, Yanagida Kenjiro said that he had visited China in 1954, and he was surprised by the great changes in China in the past six years. He said: "A country with such great changes in six years is probably unprecedented in history and in the current world."

He said that during his visit to Beijing, he saw examples of the creative application of Marxism-Leninism everywhere. He praised China's urban people's communes. Yanagida Kenjiro said excitedly that he was moved to tears when he saw tens of thousands of people singing and dancing in Tiananmen Square with bright and joyful hearts. "This reminds me that the Japanese people are also singing songs, but they are all songs of anger, resistance, and sorrow. I will definitely strive for the Japanese working people to be able to sing as happily as the Chinese people."

He finally pointed out that only when the strength of the Japanese workers and working people becomes stronger and forces the Japanese government to adopt a policy of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations can the relationship between China and Japan be truly resolved. He said that he will work hard to develop the strength of the Japanese working people and strive for the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.

    日本和平委员会访华代表团团长发表谈话
    决心努力促进中日关系正常化
    新华社8日讯　日本和平委员会访华代表团团长柳田谦十郎7日在北京对新华社记者说，日本人民将在过去斗争的基础上，以更大的力量为废除日美“安全”条约而进行斗争。他说：“过去的斗争只是一个序幕。真正的斗争现在才开始。”柳田谦十郎在叙述了日本人民在反对日美“安全”条约的斗争中的巨大胜利后说，这一斗争的最大收获之一是组成了统一战线，他说：“这是日本进步人士十五年来的一个重要问题，它通过这一斗争终于解决了。我们要像保卫眼珠一样保卫它，使它成长壮大。”
    柳田谦十郎说，在日本人民的斗争中如果忘记帝国主义是日本人民真正的敌人，不敢对美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，那是错误的。如果认为岸信介政府虽然被打倒了，但美帝国主义并没有被打倒，反而出现了代替岸信介的池田政府，因之感到悲观失望和放松斗争的意志，也是错误的。
    这位日本的著名和平人士说：在日本人民反对日美“安全”条约的斗争中一个非常可喜的现象是日本共产党的力量增长了。他说：“共产党已经越来越深入工人的心，在斗争中要求入党的人数不断增加。”
    在谈到访问我国的观感时，柳田谦十郎说1954年他曾来中国访问，中国在这六年间变化之大使他感到惊讶。他说：“在六年间有这末大变化的国家，在历史和目前世界上恐怕都是没有先例的。”
    他说，他在北京的访问中到处看到了创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的事例。他盛赞我国的城市人民公社。柳田谦十郎激动地说，他在天安门广场看到几万人群在那里以明朗、喜悦的心情载歌载舞，使他感动得流泪。“这使我想到日本人民也在唱着歌，但他们唱的都是愤怒的歌、抵抗的歌和悲痛的歌，我一定为日本劳动人民能像中国人民这样欢乐的歌唱而奋斗。”
    他最后指出，只有日本的工人和劳动人民的力量日益强大，迫使日本政府采取恢复中日邦交的政策，才能真正解决中日两国的关系问题。他表示将努力发展日本劳动人民的力量，为中日关系的正常化而奋斗。
