    Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant's No. 1 Branch Refines Management
    Reduces Production Downtime, and Increases Steel Production Every Ten Days
    (Our report) According to the Tianjin Daily, the Party organization of the No. 1 Branch of Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant, recognizing the continuous nature of converter steelmaking, has diligently and meticulously improved management practices, strengthened production coordination, and significantly reduced "small stoppages" in the production process, leading to a steady decrease in production downtime and a corresponding increase in steel production every ten-day period. From early August to mid-September, steel production increased by 5% to 17% every ten days for five consecutive periods.
    "Small stoppages" primarily refer to unnecessary pauses in the production process (such as the inability to build a new furnace after a converter becomes "cold"; the inability of the iron smelting furnace to supply molten iron in a timely manner after a converter starts, etc.). These stoppages not only affect the full utilization of equipment capacity but also create passive situations, requiring workers and cadres to spend a lot of energy dealing with these temporary problems, consuming significant time on non-productive tasks.
    Mobilizing the Masses to Get to the Bottom of the Problem
    What are the causes of "small stoppages"? To clarify this issue, in mid-August, the Party organization of this branch, following the instructions of the plant's Party committee, mobilized the masses to thoroughly investigate the problem from ideological, systemic, and technical perspectives. First, the leadership provided the masses with detailed information about existing problems in production coordination, mobilizing workers to comprehensively examine the production downtime of their respective teams and groups over the previous seven months, identify the causes, and extract typical "small stoppages" for focused analysis to derive lessons learned. For example, the iron smelting furnace team focused on analyzing the incident in early August when Team A had difficulty plugging a water eye in the furnace for a long time, causing an interruption. The analysis revealed that the main reason was that the previous team, Team C, had enlarged the iron water eye and failed to truthfully inform Team A of the situation during the shift handover. In response, the leadership introduced the advanced deeds of Wang Wenhua's steelmaking group, which often proactively helped other groups and always created favorable conditions for the next shift before going off duty. On the other hand, in light of the continuous nature of converter steelmaking, they explained the losses caused by "small stoppages" to the workers by meticulously calculating the cost. For example, the blockage of the iron water eye in the iron smelting furnace, resulting in a two- or three-minute delay in the supply of molten iron, could cause interruptions in the converter and steel casting teams, affecting an entire heat of steel. This thorough investigation was actually a form of ideological education, strengthening everyone's overall perspective and further recognizing the importance of strengthening production coordination.
    Establishing Systems Targeting Various Types of "Stoppages"
    Based on the suggestions made by the masses during the thorough investigation, the leadership, after analysis and research, and following discussions with the masses, formulated five systems and measures to strengthen production coordination.
    First, regarding "small stoppages" related to equipment, an inspection and acceptance system for key equipment was established. It stipulated that the two major key pieces of equipment, the converter and the iron smelting furnace, from furnace construction to ignition and start-up, must be jointly inspected and accepted in stages by the relevant team leaders, duty officers, and furnace chiefs, addressing specific issues and conducting comprehensive checks. When building critical parts of the converter and iron smelting furnace (such as wind eyes), the furnace construction team leader must be present. After the furnace is built, the team leader conducts a comprehensive inspection. Only after acceptance can the furnace be put into operation. After being put into operation, the converter or iron smelting furnace team leader, the duty officer on duty, the furnace chief, and the maintenance team leader, together with the furnace construction team leader, jointly inspect and accept. During acceptance, a trial run is conducted. If problems are found, repairs are made on the spot. After the repairs, another trial run is conducted until all aspects are completely problem-free, and the acceptance is completed. This inspection and acceptance system is strictly enforced.
    Second, regarding "small stoppages" related to starting new furnaces, a system was established requiring team leaders and furnace chiefs to jointly take responsibility for starting new furnaces. Successfully starting a new converter or iron smelting furnace is an important step in reducing "small stoppages." In the past, due to insufficient attention to starting new furnaces, a lack of understanding of the furnace's characteristics, and improper control of wind pressure, temperature, and charging volume, problems often occurred, affecting the furnace's lifespan and causing interruptions. After establishing the system of team leaders being responsible for starting new furnaces, because the team leaders are all skilled veteran workers with rich experience, the workers become more conscientious when they see the team leaders personally starting the furnace, which greatly improves the quality of furnace starts, creating favorable conditions for smooth production in the future.
    Third, regarding "trivial stoppages" in all aspects, a system of post responsibility was established, clarifying the responsibilities of each individual, so that minor and scattered problems in each team and type of work can be assigned to specific individuals. First, the division of labor among the furnace chief, the first, second, and third assistants, and general workers in the converter and iron smelting furnace teams was clarified. Secondly, full-time maintenance workers were assigned to the transmission equipment, and wind and water systems on the converter and iron smelting furnace. As a result, the workers' sense of responsibility was strengthened, and they were motivated to study their own work, improve their technical skills, and enhance the quality of their work. Since the implementation of this regulation, production has been well-organized every shift, and the phenomenon of production interruptions caused by minor "trivial" matters has been greatly reduced.
    Fourth, regarding "small stoppages" caused during shift handovers, a shift handover system and a shift handover inspection system were established. The regulations state that: (1) each shift must prepare tools and materials for the next shift, clean the furnace pit and casting site, and be responsible for telling the next shift in detail about the production conditions, equipment status, operational experience, and precautions of the current shift; (2) each shift must hand over on time, without rushing to produce steel or molten iron, so as not to affect the normal production of the next shift; (3) cross-operation is implemented during shift handover, with the incoming furnace chief arriving one hour early and the outgoing furnace chief leaving one hour late to help each other and coordinate operations; (4) a shift handover inspection team composed of the branch director, the duty officer, and the team leader is established to follow the shifts to inspect the shift handover situation, and report the shift handover inspection situation at the daily production scheduling meeting to establish a system of criticism and commendation. The implementation of this system has promoted each shift to create favorable conditions for the next shift, enabling each shift to quickly and normally resume production after taking over.
    Fifth, regarding problems where some "small stoppages" recur, a system of step-by-step "small stoppage" analysis by groups, teams, and the branch was established. They stipulate that regardless of the size of the "stoppage" that occurs in production, an analysis must be made within 24 hours to identify the cause and methods to prevent recurrence, learn from the lessons, and avoid repetition.
    Improving Leadership Methods to Enhance Foresight and Initiative
    While improving management practices, the leadership of this branch has also conscientiously improved leadership methods, implementing the "grasping with both hands" working method in their work: grasping the present while also grasping the next step, grasping key points while also taking care of all aspects, grasping major issues while not neglecting minor issues. This has enhanced foresight, fostered a proactive approach everywhere, and ensured the close coordination of all links. After starting work each day, branch leaders first go to each process to "take a quick tour" to see how many converters and iron smelting furnaces are operating, how many are under construction, and whether there are backups, which is called "counting the furnace shells." If problems are found with the backups during "counting the furnace shells," they immediately understand the reasons and organize forces to tackle and resolve them. For example, on one occasion, the Party branch secretary discovered during "counting the furnace shells" that Furnace No. 1 was operating and making steel, while Furnace No. 2 was under construction. When he asked about the situation at the furnace, he learned that Furnace No. 1 would not have a long furnace age, while the furnace being built was being built by a group with a slower furnace construction speed. He calculated that this might cause a "stoppage." Therefore, he went to the furnace construction team to inform the workers of the situation of Furnace No. 1 and mobilized them to speed up their work. As a result, the furnace was built ahead of schedule, ensuring the coordination of the converter. While leading the current production, the leadership also regularly understands and grasps the supply and quality of raw materials for the next stage, and promptly prepares for changes in raw materials to avoid being caught off guard and becoming passive.
    The converter and iron smelting furnace teams are the focus of the steelmaking production process, but without the close cooperation of other teams, it would be difficult for the converter and iron smelting furnace to produce steel and molten iron. In response, the leaders of this branch not only focus their main efforts on the converter and iron smelting furnace, but also do not relax the work of other teams such as the overhead crane, steel casting, and furnace construction. The deputy secretary of the Party branch often goes to the steel casting and furnace construction teams to do ideological work, and the work of these teams is also listed as an important agenda item in the administrative scheduling meeting, so that these teams can center their work around steelmaking and ensure the coordination of steelmaking.

    天津第二钢厂一分厂管理工作越做越细
    减少生产中断时间钢产量旬旬提高
    本报讯　据天津日报消息：天津市第二钢厂一分厂党组织针对转炉炼钢连续性强的特点，认真细致地改进管理工作，加强生产衔接，大大减少了生产过程中的“小站头”，使生产中断时间逐旬降低，钢产量逐旬上升。8月上旬到9月中旬连续五个旬，钢产量逐旬提高的幅度是5％至17％。
    “小站头”，主要是指在生产过程中不应有的停顿（例如转炉“冷炉”以后，新炉不能砌好；转炉开炉以后，化铁炉不能及时供应铁水，等等）。它不仅影响整个设备能力的发挥，也造成了工作的被动，工人和干部要用很多的精力去处理这些临时发生的问题，使非生产性作业占去很多时间。
    发动群众刨根问底
    产生“小站头”的原因是什么？为了弄清这个问题，8月中旬，这个分厂的党组织根据厂党委的指示，发动群众从思想上、制度上和技术上刨根问底。首先由领导上把生产衔接上存在的问题向群众详细交底，动员职工对本班、本组前七个多月的生产中断情况进行全面检查，找出原因，从中找出典型的“小站头”，进行重点分析，得出经验教训。如化铁炉工段着重分析了8月上旬甲班堵炉水眼很长时间没有堵好，造成中断的事件。分析的结果，主要是由于上一班——丙班把铁水眼烧大了，交接班时丙班又没有把这种情况如实地告诉甲班而造成的。针对这种情况，领导上一方面向工人们介绍王文华炼钢小组经常主动帮助其他小组、每次下班前都为下一班创造好条件的先进事迹；另一方面又结合转炉炼钢连续性强的特点，通过算细账的方法，向职工们讲解“小站头”给生产带来的损失。如化铁炉铁水眼堵塞，使铁水晚供应二、三分钟，就会造成转炉、铸钢等各工段的中断，就可以影响一炉钢。这场刨根问底活动，实际上也是一场思想教育活动，使大家加强了全局观点，进一步认识到加强生产衔接的重要性。
    针对各类“站头”建立制度
    根据群众在刨根问底活动中提出的建议，领导上经过分析研究，又经过群众讨论，制定了五项加强生产衔接的制度和办法。
    第一，针对设备上的“小站头”，制定了关键设备检查，验收制度。规定转炉、化铁炉这两大关键设备从砌炉开始到点火开炉，必须由有关工段长、值班主任、炉长联合分段，按问题和全面检查验收。转炉、化铁炉在砌一些关键部位（如风眼等）时，必须有砌炉工段长在场，炉子砌完，由工段长进行全面检查，验收后，才能上炉。上炉后再由转炉或化铁炉工段长、当班的值班主任和炉长、保全工段长，会同砌炉工段长联合检查，验收，验收时要进行一次试验性运转，发现问题，当场检修，检修后再试运转，直到各方面完全没有问题时，验收才算结束。这种检查验收制度执行非常严格。
    第二，针对开新炉的“小站头”规定了工段长和炉长共同负责开新炉的制度。转炉，化铁炉开好新炉是减少“小站头”的重要一环。过去因为对开新炉注意不够，摸不准炉子的脾气，对风压、温度、装炉量掌握不适当，往往发生问题，影响炉子寿命，造成中断。建立了工段长负责开新炉的制度以后，因为工段长都是熟练的老工人，经验丰富，工人们看到工段长亲自开炉，工作就更加认真，使得开炉质量大大提高，为以后的顺利生产创造了有利条件。
    第三，针对各方面的“鸡毛蒜皮小站头”，建立岗位责任制度，明确每个人的职责，使各工段、工种的零星小问题都能落实到人。首先在转炉、化铁炉工段明确了炉长、一、二、三助手和一般工人的分工。其次对转炉、化铁炉上的传动设备、风、水系统都设立了专职维护的保全工人。这样做的结果，既加强了工人的责任心，又促进了工人钻研本身业务，提高技术水平和工作质量。自从实行这个规定以来，每班开炉生产都能井井有条，因为一些“鸡毛蒜皮”的小事造成生产中断的现象大大减少了。
    第四，针对交接班中造成的“小站头”，建立了交接班制度和交接班检查制度。规定：（一）每班在交班时，必须为下一班准备好工具、材料，清理好炉坑和浇铸场地，并负责把本班的生产条件、设备状况、操作上的经验和注意事项详细告诉下一班；（二）每班都要按时交班，不能抢出钢、抢出铁水，影响下一班正常生产；（三）交接班时实行交叉作业，接班的炉长早来一小时，交班的炉长晚走一小时，互相帮助，衔接操作；（四）建立由分厂主任、值班主任、工段长联合组成的交接班检查小组，跟班检查交接班情况，并在每天的生产调度会议上报告交接班检查情况，建立批评和表扬制度。这个制度实行以后，促进了各班为下一班创造有利条件，使每个班接班以后都能迅速正常生产。
    第五，针对一些“小站头”重复出现的问题，建立组、班和分厂的逐级“小站头”分析制度。他们规定，无论生产上出现的大、小“站头”，必须在二十四小时内做出分析，找出原因和杜绝的办法，吸取教训，避免重复。
    改进领导方法增强预见性和主动性
    在改进管理工作的同时，这个分厂的领导上还认真改进了领导方法，在工作中贯彻执行了两手抓的工作方法，既抓当前又抓下一步，既抓重点又照顾四面八方，既抓大问题又不忽视小问题。这样就增强了预见性，处处争主动，保证各环节的紧密衔接。分厂领导干部每天上班以后，先到各工序“走马观花”，看看转炉、化铁炉开几个、有几个在砌、有无后备，谓之“数炉壳”。“数炉壳”时发现后备有患，立即了解原因，组织力量突击解决。如有一次，总支书记在“数炉壳”时，发现一号炉正开炉炼钢，而二号炉正在砌炉。到炉上一问，一号炉炉龄不会太长，而砌炉的正好是一个砌炉速度较慢的小组，算起来可能造成“站头”。于是，他就到砌炉小组将一号炉的情况告诉给工人们，动员他们加快速度。结果炉子提前砌好，保证了转炉的衔接。在领导当前生产的同时，领导上还经常了解和掌握下一阶段原料、材料的供应情况和质量情况，及时针对原料、材料的变化做好准备，避免临时措手不及，造成被动。
    在炼钢生产过程中转炉、化铁炉工段是重点，但是如果没有其他工段的紧密配合，转炉、化铁炉也难以出钢、出铁水。针对这种情况，这个分厂的领导上既用主要力量抓转炉和化铁炉，同时也不放松天车、铸钢、砌炉等各工段的工作，党总支副书记经常到铸钢、砌炉工段去做思想工作，行政的调度会议上也把这些工段的工作列为重要议程，使这些工段都能以炼钢为中心，来安排自己的工作，保证炼钢的衔接。（附图片）
