The Nepalese "Language Newspaper" Says
China Consistently Supports the Struggles of People of All Countries

    The Nepalese "Language Newspaper" published an editorial on October 1st to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    The editorial said, "The victory of the Chinese people proves that imperialist forces cannot stand in the face of the power of the people. The establishment of the People's Republic of China is a source of encouragement for the people of many underdeveloped countries in the world to carry out struggles for national independence. China's policy has consistently been one of supporting the struggles of people of all countries for freedom."

    The editorial then said that China's National Day is not only a joyous day for the Chinese people, but also a joyous day for all of China's friends. We hope that the Chinese people will achieve increasingly great success in the struggle to build their country.
