Jinan, October 7th (from our newspaper) - This autumn, the Huangcheng Commune in Penglai County, Shandong Province, based on past experience, has appropriately matched wheat varieties to stagger the maturity dates of wheat next year. This avoids the labor shortage caused by a single variety maturing at the same time.

　　Appropriately matching the proportion of improved varieties during autumn planting is a new measure taken by commune members after summarizing their past experiences. In the past, especially last year, more than 80% of the commune's wheat varieties were the "Dali Banmang" variety. Due to the single variety and uniform maturity, all of the commune's more than 22,000 mu of wheat matured completely within three to five days this year. With the wheat ripening so uniformly and the labor force unable to keep up, the result affected the bumper harvest. For example, the second team of the Linjiazhuangzi Brigade lost more than 20 jin of wheat per mu this year because the wheat ripened at the same time and they could not harvest it in time. However, the fourth team of the Linjiazhuangzi Brigade, because the wheat varieties were diverse and the maturity dates were divided into early, middle, and late periods, not only did they not experience a labor shortage, but they also ensured careful harvesting and returned every grain to the granary. The comparison of these two different examples made the commune members fully aware of the importance of arranging wheat varieties.

　　In order to ensure the implementation of the autumn planting variety matching plan, the commune has planned dozens of planting areas, and each planting area is marked with a sign indicating the wheat variety to facilitate commune members to plant according to the plan.

    黄城公社种麦品种多样化
    本报济南7日电　山东蓬莱县黄城公社在今年秋种中，根据过去的经验，适当搭配了小麦品种，使明年小麦的成熟期前后错开，避免因品种单一，成熟期一致，造成劳力紧张的现象。
    秋种时适当搭配良种比例，是社员们总结了过去的经验以后，采取的一项新措施。过去，特别是去年，这个社的小麦品种，80％以上是种的大粒半芒。由于品种单一，成熟期一致，今年全社的两万二千多亩小麦，在三、五天内就全部成熟了。小麦熟的这么齐，劳力又跟不上去，结果影响了丰产丰收。如林家庄子大队第二小队，今年就是因为小麦熟的齐，来不及收割，每亩小麦掉粒二十多斤。但是，林家庄子大队第四小队，因为小麦品种多种多样，成熟期分成了早、中、晚三个时期，不但没有发生劳力紧张现象，而且保证了精收细打，颗粒还家。这两个不同事例的对比，使社员们充分认识到安排小麦品种的重要性。
    为了保证秋种品种搭配计划的实现，全社共规划了几十个播种区，每个播种区都插牌注明小麦品种，以便于社员按计划播种。
