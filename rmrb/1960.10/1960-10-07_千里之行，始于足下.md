    "A Journey of a Thousand Miles Begins with a Single Step"
    Lin Xu
    The fearless heroism and indomitable revolutionary spirit of our mountaineers have been widely praised. Every time we recall the world-shaking miracles created by the mountaineering heroes, we are encouraged and profoundly educated time and again.
    In the documentary "Conquering the World's Highest Peak," every scene is an immortal historical chapter, and every narration is a heart-stirring heroic melody. However, two scenes are especially worthy of our deep consideration. One scene is: the mountaineering heroes, heads held high and chests out, gazing at the majestic peak of the world, their spirit as magnificent as the mountains and rivers, declaring their determination to trample Mount Everest under their feet; the other scene is: the entire screen shows a sturdy and powerful foot, that big foot climbing the steep ice walls, steadily and unswervingly climbing upward step by step. The two scenes echo each other, confirming a truth to the people, that is: both the soaring ambition to dare to think and dare to do, and the down-to-earth and hard-working spirit of seeking truth; both the revolutionary courage to despise difficulties, and the revolutionary perseverance to overcome difficulties. Revolutionary ideals plus revolutionary practice, this is precisely the source of the heroes' power of "no height is insurmountable, no fortress is indestructible."
    Mountaineering is like this, and so is doing anything.
    The combination of lofty revolutionary ideals and a scientific spirit of seeking truth constitutes the complete revolutionary spirit of Marxists. Without revolutionary ideals, all practice will naturally lose its firm political direction and clear political purpose. With revolutionary ideals, but without concrete practice, what will happen? Then: any beautiful ideal is just a fantasy, and can never be realized. It can be seen that ideals are the guide to practice, and practice is the embodiment of ideals.
    Lao Tzu's "Tao Te Ching" has some good words: "The most difficult things in the world must be started from the easiest; the greatest things in the world must be started from the smallest." It also says: "A tree that fills the arms grows from a tiny sprout. A nine-story tower begins with a pile of earth. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." Regardless of Lao Tzu's philosophical thoughts, these words contain a simple dialectical view, which means: arduous undertakings must be started from simple things, and great undertakings must be started from small things. A towering tree begins with a tiny sprout, a majestic building begins with the accumulation of bricks and wood, and a journey of a thousand miles begins with walking step by step.
    The principle is very clear. Walking requires taking one step at a time, and doing things requires doing them bit by bit. If you want to make revolution, you must truly have revolutionary practical actions; if you want to build, you must start with a brick, a tile, a piece of wood, and a stone; if you want to turn poverty into wealth, you must work hard; if you want to master scientific knowledge, you must study hard and delve deeply; if you want to guide work and promote work, you must specifically solve the specific problems that exist in the work. …
    Xing Yanzi, Jing Huanyun, Zhu Yuqi, and other ambitious young people are determined to build a new socialist countryside. This determination cannot be considered small, but their measures to realize this vow start from concrete actions, going to the countryside and participating in actual labor on the agricultural front. Li Shimei, a rural youth with a junior high school education, became a termite expert and a professor at Sun Yat-sen University; Zhou Hanhua, a 23-year-old peasant, experimented with distant hybridization of rice and sorghum, and tested five excellent rice varieties; He Wenyi, a 20-year-old peasant who did not recognize a single chemical symbol, set up a chemical factory with three large pots... They are all idealist pragmatists who have a broad vision, start from small things, are far-sighted, and seek truth from facts.
    Faced with such facts, some people often express their approval of their ideals, but oppose their actions, saying: "Look! How silly these people are, just doing some insignificant little things." It seems that what they oppose are small things, but in fact, they oppose big things; it seems that they do not approve of the young people's specific actions, but in fact, they do not approve of the young people's revolutionary ideals; it seems that they oppose the beginning of the "foot," but in fact, they oppose the "journey of a thousand miles."
    "A journey of a thousand miles" and "begins with a single step" are a dialectical unity. "A journey of a thousand miles" is our goal; "begins with a single step" is starting from the current reality. Proletarian revolutionaries have always attached great importance to revolutionary ideals. Without revolutionary ideals, there would be no revolutionary action. We are communists, and our ideal is to realize a communist society throughout the world. But at the same time, we also attach great importance to revolutionary practice, because we are dialectical materialists and historical materialists, and we have always strictly based our policies on a scientific analysis of the laws of social development, and we have conscientiously completed every concrete task. The reason why my country's socialist construction has achieved such great achievements is precisely because: the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and a series of two-legged walking policies, have combined strict scientificity and revolutionary nature most completely? With both the revolutionary ambition to travel "a thousand miles" and the pragmatic spirit of "begins with a single step," from small to large, accumulating small things into many, from near to far, moving forward step by step firmly, the ideal goal must be achieved, and it must be achieved.
    We are different from those empty talkers who engage in lofty discussions, because fantasizing that an ideal realm can appear without arduous struggle has never happened in history, and will never happen in the future. Looking at thousands of miles away, but not moving a single step, then the distance of thousands of miles can never be shortened by itself. Isn't this principle clear?
    We are also different from those mediocre experientialists. Their eyes only look at their feet, only look at the roads they have already traveled, but cannot see the bright future. Their minds are as narrow as the roads they walk. If they do not use firm revolutionary ideals to illuminate their way forward, they are likely to lose their way.
    "To climb a mountain, one must start from the lowlands; to travel far, one must start from nearby." People who are far-sighted and stride forward will never be satisfied with the achievements of "foot," because ideals have no end, and roads have no end. We will always be full of confidence and stride forward!

### “千里之行，始于足下”

    “千里之行，始于足下”
    林旭
    我国登山运动员们那种无畏的英雄气概和坚韧不拔的革命精神，已经被人们传颂开了。每当我们想起登山英雄们创下的举世奇迹，总是一次又一次地从中受到鼓舞，一次又一次地得到深刻的教育。
    《征服世界最高峰》的纪录片里，每一个镜头都是不朽的历史篇章，每一句解说词都是动人心弦的英雄乐曲。但其中有两个镜头更加值得我们深思。一个镜头是：登山英雄，昂首挺胸，眼望着那巍峨的世界之巅，气壮河山，宣誓要把珠穆朗玛峰踩在脚下；另一个镜头是：整个银幕上现出一只粗壮有力的脚，那只大脚攀登着悬崖冰壁，坚定不移地一步一步向上爬去。两个镜头前后辉映，向人们印证了一个道理，那就是：既有敢想敢干的凌云壮志，又有踏踏实实、艰苦奋斗的求实精神；既有藐视困难的革命勇气，又有战胜困难的革命毅力。革命的理想加上革命的实践，这正是英雄们“无高不可攀，无坚不可摧”的力量的源泉。
    登山是这样，办任何事情也都是这样。
    远大的革命理想和科学的求实精神相结合，构成了马克思主义者完整的革命精神。没有革命的理想，一切实践自然都失去了坚定的政治方向和明确的政治目的。有了革命的理想，而没有具体的实践，又怎样呢？那将是：任何美好的理想也不过是空想，永远也不能实现。可见得，理想是实践的指南，实践是理想的体现。
    老子的《道德经》中有几句话说得好：“天下难事，必作于易；天下大事，必作于细。”又说：“合抱之木，生于毫末。九层之台，起于累土。千里之行，始于足下。”姑且不论老子的哲学思想如何，他这一些话里包含着一个朴素的辩证观点，那意思是说：艰巨的事业要从简单的事情入手，伟大的事业要从细小的事情入手。参天的大树始于幼小的萌芽，巍峨的高楼始于一砖一木的垒筑，千里的路途始于一步一步的行走。
    道理是很清楚的。走路要一步一步地去走，事情要一点一滴地去做。你要革命，你就要真正有革命的实际行动；你要建设，你就得从一砖一瓦、一木一石开始；你要变穷为富，你就要艰苦奋斗；你要掌握科学知识，你就要苦学苦钻；你要指导工作，推动工作前进，你就要具体地解决工作中存在的具体问题。……
    邢燕子、荆焕云、朱玉琪等等这些有志气的青年，决心建设社会主义的新农村。这决心不能算小，可是他们实现这个誓言的措施正是从具体的行动开始，到农村去，到农业战线上去参加实际的劳动。初中程度的农村青年李始美，成为白蚁专家和中山大学的教授；二十三岁的青年农民周汉华，用水稻同高粱远缘杂交，试验出五个优良水稻品种；二十岁的青年农民何文义，一个化学符号也不认识，用三口大锅办起了一座化工厂……。他们都是从大处着眼、从小处着手，高瞻远瞩，实事求是的有理想的实干家。
    面对着这样的事实，有人常常表示赞成他们的理想，却反对他们的行动，说是：“你看！这些人多傻，净做一些微不足道的小事。”看来，他们反对的是些小事，实际反对的正是大事；看来，他们不赞成那些青年们的具体行动，实际上不赞成的正是青年们革命的理想；看来，他们反对的是“足下”之始，实际反对的正是“千里之行”。
      “千里之行”和“始于足下”，是一个辩证的统一体。“千里之行”是我们的目标；“始于足下”是从当前的现实出发。无产阶级革命者从来都十分重视革命的理想。没有革命的理想，就没有革命的行动。我们是共产主义者，我们的理想就是要在全世界实现共产主义社会。但同时，我们又十分重视革命的实践，因为我们是辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义者，从来都严格地依据对社会发展规律的科学分析，来制定自己的政策，并且切切实实地去完成每一件具体工作。我国的社会主义建设事业之所以取得了如此巨大的成绩，那不正是由于：总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗和一系列两条腿走路的方针，把严格的科学性和革命性最完整地结合在一起吗？既有远行“千里”的革命大志，又有“始于足下”的求实精神，由小而大，积少成多，由近及远，一步一步坚定地走下去，理想的目标是一定要实现，而且是一定能够实现的。
    我们区别于那些高谈阔论的空谈家，因为幻想着不经过艰苦的斗争就可以出现一个理想的境界，历史上从来不曾有过，以后也永远不会有。眼望着千里之外，但是一步也不动，那么，千里之遥的距离永远是不可能自行缩短的。这道理不是清清楚楚的吗？
    我们也区别于那些庸庸碌碌的经验家。他们的眼睛只看着脚下，只看着已经走过的道路，却看不到远大的前程。他们的胸怀就像他们所走的道路那么狭窄。如果他们不用坚定的革命理想来照亮自己的前进道路，那就很可能迷失方向。
    “登山必自卑，远行必自迩”。高瞻远瞩而又大踏步前进的人，永远也不会满足于“足下”的成绩，因为理想无止境，道路无尽头。我们永远满怀信心，昂首阔步一直向前走去！
