Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 6th. Workers at Anshan Iron and Steel's Second Steel Plant have launched a competition to produce two heats of steel per open-hearth furnace per day during the increase production and practice economy campaign. They conscientiously implement the smelting operation policy of "more charging, fast smelting, high temperature, and long furnace life." Since mid-September, 60% of the open-hearth furnaces have achieved a daily output of two heats of steel, and 10% have achieved a daily output of three heats of steel. From September 11th to 25th, the average smelting time per heat of steel was reduced by one hour and twenty-six minutes compared to August, and the daily output increased sharply by 18.55%.

At the end of August, when the Second Steel Plant discussed the production plan, it conducted a comprehensive analysis of the output, quality, smelting time, and furnace maintenance for the first seven months, and made a detailed calculation. The calculation result: if the smelting time is reduced by one hour in the next four months, the increase production and practice economy plan for this year can not only be completed but also greatly exceeded. To make the planned targets both advanced and practical, the Party committee decided to launch a competition for each open-hearth furnace to "produce two heats of steel per day." The broad masses of workers quickly turned the Party's decision into practical action. Relay races and rivalries unfolded between furnaces, shifts, and groups. In the competition, they conscientiously implemented the smelting operation policy of "more charging, fast smelting, high temperature, and long furnace life." Workers at the No. 11 open-hearth furnace raced against time and took the lead in setting a record of smelting a heat of steel in seven hours and fifty-five minutes. Because workers in each shift created conditions for the next shift, this open-hearth furnace produced three heats of steel per day for three consecutive days and was rated as a high-quality, high-yield red flag for the entire plant. The No. 11 open-hearth furnace became an object of "learning from, catching up with, and surpassing" for the entire plant. Yang Shuyu, the Party group leader of the No. 15 open-hearth furnace, held an enlarged meeting of the Party group in front of the furnace, determined to catch up with the No. 11 open-hearth furnace. All the workers in the furnace cleaned the residual slag from the slag channel under the furnace, and the No. 2 and No. 3 charging machines charged the materials quickly and steadily. They smelted a heat of steel in seven hours and fifty-five minutes and produced two heats of steel per day for ten consecutive days. Good news of smelting a heat of steel in twelve hours, ten hours, eight hours, and even more than six hours was continuously reported throughout the plant.

In the heated competition, steelworkers paid great attention to maintaining the furnace body. At present, each open-hearth furnace is "young" and "strong," and its life has been greatly extended. Liu Hanman, the Party branch secretary of the No. 17 open-hearth furnace, and Zhao Ronglu, the general furnace leader, led four shifts of workers to the No. 15 open-hearth furnace, which had won the red flag for furnace protection eight times in a row, to "learn from the experience." Upon returning, they immediately organized a discussion and divided each shift into three maintenance groups to carry out a furnace protection matchup. For more than two months, this open-hearth furnace has not had any problems and has been transformed from a "short-lived furnace" to a "long-lived furnace." Because the furnace body is well maintained, it has been producing two heats of steel every day since September 20th.

In the competition for each open-hearth furnace to produce two heats of steel per day, workers in casting, raw materials, transportation, testing, canteen, and offices regarded the realization of this goal as their lofty responsibility in the increase production and practice economy campaign and offered suggestions and advice to help overcome difficulties. At the beginning of the competition, casting workers set their ambition to ensure that it would not affect open-hearth furnace production for even one minute. They built the steel ladle and slag ladle firmly and quickly, and guaranteed to supply as much as needed. Raw material supply workers were even more assertive and put forward the slogan of "Let the open-hearth furnace eat its fill and eat well," and everyone strived to make contributions to producing more steel. They prepared all the twenty-odd kinds of steelmaking raw materials, and the material troughs on the material platform were always full. In addition to completing their own work, management cadres from the offices also went to the open-hearth furnace to serve as commanders, fighters, and propagandists. Testers were even more proactive, taking the steel samples for testing as soon as they were cast. All of these powerfully promoted the realization of producing two heats of steel per day.

From this newspaper: According to a report from the Hubei Daily: Daye Steel Plant has launched a vigorous increase production and practice economy campaign. They have adopted measures such as ideological education, competition, and strengthened leadership, which have made the whole plant appear to be boiling with the production of more steel and better steel, thereby successfully completing the state's steel production plan for September. The daily steel production level increased sharply by 20.23% compared to August.

Entering September, the Daye Steel Plant's Party Committee adopted various forms to tell the workers about the political and economic significance of the increase production and practice economy campaign, making the increase production and practice economy campaign deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Then, all the workers in the plant formulated increase production and practice economy plans, carried out communist cooperation on a large scale, put forward measures, thought of methods, and launched a vigorous competition. Open-hearth furnace steelworkers launched a red flag competition based on the furnace and according to shift, same type of work, and same equipment. The electric furnace launched a four-quick performance competition of slag removal, furnace patching, charging, melting, and oxidation. The two furnace groups in the converter workshop launched a hundred-ton opponent race. The steel rolling workers launched a post operation race, and the transportation department workers also launched a competition to improve transportation efficiency. According to the increase production and practice economy plan, the steelworkers of the No. 3 open-hearth furnace calculated the detailed accounts of how much steel should be produced per hour and per minute each month. They immediately implemented the post responsibility system, adopted new technical operations, and created a new record of smelting a heat of steel in eleven minutes and forty-eight seconds. The No. 4 open-hearth furnace immediately learned from the experience of the No. 3 open-hearth furnace, deployed combat forces, and the next day, the time for smelting a heat of steel was shortened from fifteen o'clock to thirteen minutes and twenty-five seconds. Then, the No. 3 open-hearth furnace created a new record of smelting a heat of steel in eleven minutes and forty-two seconds and ten minutes and thirty-nine seconds. The medium-sized open-hearth furnace was also chasing after each other. The No. 1 small open-hearth furnace was not willing to lag behind. From the 12th to the 17th, Zhou Qing's shift produced six heats of steel, of which the smelting time of five heats of steel was less than eight hours, which was more than two hours shorter than in the past.

In order to seize every minute, produce more steel, and produce good steel, and concentrate the enthusiasm of the workers on the current key to production, Daye Steel Plant changed the organizational form of the Party branch from being organized according to horizontal shifts to establishing Party branches according to furnaces and furnace groups, implementing a furnace-contracting system, and strengthening the Party's leadership in grassroots combat units of production. Leaders at all levels also went deep into the furnace platform, contracted furnaces on a contract basis, and worked with the masses to find key points, think of methods, organize key battles, and deepen and thoroughly grasp ideology and work, and tightly and fiercely grasp the key to production. From September 16th to 25th, the entire plant carried out the fourth key battle of the third quarter, based on equipment maintenance, focusing on eight iron smelting furnaces, and targeting high sulfur as the main direction of attack. In this key battle, workers in various departments actively adopted new smelting methods, using technical innovation and technical revolution as weapons, and encircled and suppressed high sulfur from all sides. After implementing the operation of full-air bright eyes, large slag volume, and high alkalinity, the iron smelting furnace workers of the First Steelmaking Department increased the daily output of molten iron by one time compared to the past, the desulfurization efficiency rapidly increased to 70%, and the furnace age was greatly extended. The No. 2 iron smelting furnace of the Third Steelmaking Department also created a new record of desulfurization rate reaching more than 89%. Converter steelworkers adopted double-row wind eyes, and the desulfurization efficiency also rapidly increased to 50%. In order to overcome high sulfur by all means, the workers also created advanced experience such as electrolytic desulfurization, using electric furnace slag and plant ash to remove sulfur, adopting high furnace-type furnace bottoms and pre-furnace carbon increase in the iron smelting furnace, and using raw dolomite to build the furnace lining. Among them, the desulfurization efficiency of the electrolytic desulfurization alone reached 60%.

Under the situation of a substantial increase in production and a comprehensive leap forward, on the basis of the general improvement of the ideological awareness of the workers, the enterprise management work of Daye Steel Plant has also been further developed. From the plant department to the workshop and work section, a three-shift rotation system was established to strengthen the leadership of night shift production and ensure that production command does not leave the scene. In terms of planning management, a system of two inspections and one balance a day, and one analysis, one evaluation, and one deployment every five days was established. All of these have greatly enhanced the organization and combat effectiveness of production and ensured the comprehensive and continuous leap forward of production. (Attached picture)

    劳动竞赛根子扎在基层炼钢生产不断传出捷报
    鞍钢第二炼钢厂班组竞赛热烈
    大冶钢厂加强基层生产领导，深入开展技术革命，争分夺秒多炼好钢
    新华社鞍山6日电　鞍钢第二炼钢厂职工在增产节约运动中掀起了每座平炉每天炼两炉钢的竞赛，他们认真贯彻多装、快炼、高温、长寿的冶炼操作方针，从9月中旬以来，60％的平炉达到日产两炉钢，10％的平炉达到日产三炉钢。从9月11日到25日的十五天当中，每炉钢平均冶炼时间比8月份缩短了一小时二十六分钟，日产量猛增18.55％。
    8月末，第二炼钢厂讨论生产计划的时候，对前七个月的产量、质量、熔炼时间、炉体维护等进行了全面分析，并且算了一笔细账。计算结果：如果在今后四个月内把熔炼时间压缩一个小时，今年增产节约计划不但能够完成，而且可以大大超过。为使计划指标既先进又切实可行，党委决定开展每座平炉“日产两炉钢”的竞赛，广大职工把党的决定迅速变成了实际行动。炉与炉、班与班、小组与小组之间相互展开了接力赛和对手赛。竞赛中，他们认真地贯彻了多装、快炼、高温、长寿的冶炼操作方针。十一号平炉职工争分夺秒，首创以七小时五十五分炼一炉钢的纪录。由于各个班次的工人互相给下一班次创造条件，这座平炉连续三天日产三炉钢，被评为全厂优质高产红旗。十一号平炉成了全厂“学赶超”的对象。十五号平炉党小组长杨术禹在炉前开了党小组扩大会，决心赶上十一号平炉，全炉工人一股劲把炉下渣道的残渣清理得一干二净，二号和三号装料机装料又快又稳。他们用七小时五十五分炼出了一炉钢，而且连续十天日产两炉钢。全厂不断传出了用十二小时、十小时、八小时，甚至六个多小时炼一炉钢的捷报。
    在热烈的竞赛中，炼钢工人十分注意维护好炉体。目前，平炉个个“年轻”、“健壮”，寿命大大延长。十七号平炉党支部书记刘汉满、总炉长赵荣禄为维护好炉体，分别率领四班工人到连获八次护炉红旗的十五号平炉去“取经”，回来立即组织座谈，把每班分成三个维护小组，开展了护炉对口赛。两个多月来，这座平炉没出一点毛病，由过去的“短命炉”变成了“长寿炉”。由于炉体维护得好，9月20日以来天天出两炉钢。
    在每座平炉日产两炉钢的竞赛中，铸锭、原料、运输、化验、食堂和科室职工都把实现这一目标当成自己在增产节约运动中的崇高职责，纷纷献计献策，帮助攻关。竞赛一开始，铸锭工人就立下雄心，保证不影响平炉生产一分钟。他们把钢水缶、渣子缶砌得又结实又快，需要多少就保证供应多少。原料供应工人更不示弱，提出了“让平炉吃饱吃好”的口号，人人争取为多炼钢立功。他们把二十几种炼钢原料样样备足，料台上的料槽总是满满的。机关管理干部除完成自己的工作以外，还到平炉上做指挥员、战斗员和宣传员。化验人员更是主动，钢样刚刚铸出，就拿去化验。这些都有力地促进了日产两炉钢的实现。
    本报讯　据湖北日报消息：大冶钢厂掀起了热火朝天的增产节约运动，他们通过思想教育，开展竞赛，加强领导等措施，使全厂出现了多炼钢炼好钢的沸腾景象，从而胜利完成了9月份国家钢产量计划，钢的日产水平比8月份猛增20.23％。
    进入9月，大冶钢厂党委采取各种形式，向职工大讲增产节约运动的政治和经济意义，使增产节约运动深入人心。接着全厂职工纷纷制定增产节约计划，大搞共产主义协作，提措施，想办法，开展了热火朝天的竞赛。平炉炼钢工人开展了以炉按班同工种同设备的红旗竞赛，电炉开展了扒渣补炉、装料、熔化、氧化四快表演赛，转炉车间两个炉组开展了百吨对手赛，轧钢工人开展了岗位操作赛，运输部职工也开展了提高运输效率的竞赛。三号平炉炼钢工人按增产节约计划，算出每个月每小时每分钟要炼多少钢的细账，立即推行了岗位责任制，采用新的技术操作，创造了十一点四十八分钟炼一炉钢的新纪录。四号平炉立即学习三号平炉的经验，部署战斗力量，第二天，就由十五点钟炼一炉钢缩短为十三点二十五分钟，接着，三号平炉又创造了十一点四十二分、十点三十九分炼一炉钢的新纪录。中型平炉也是你追我赶，一号小平炉不甘落后，周青三班从12日到17日，炼了六炉钢，其中有五炉钢的冶炼时间都在八小时以下，比过去缩短了两个多小时。
    为了争分夺秒，多炼钢，炼好钢，把职工的积极性集中到当前的生产关键上，大冶钢厂将过去按横班组成党支部的组织形式改为按炉子和炉组建立党支部，实行包炉制，加强生产基层战斗单位党的领导。各级领导干部也都深入炉台，分炉包干，和群众一道，找关键，想办法，组织攻关战役，作到思想、工作抓深、抓透，生产关键抓紧、抓狠。全厂从9月16日到25日，以设备维护为基础，以八个化铁炉为重点，以高硫为主攻方向，开展了三季度第四次攻关战役。在这次攻关战役中，各个部门职工以技术革新和技术革命作为武器，积极采用新的冶炼方法，从四面八方围歼高硫。一炼钢部化铁炉职工，推行全风亮眼、大渣量、高碱度的操作以后，铁水日产量比过去增加一倍，脱硫效率迅速提高到70％，炉龄也大大延长。第三炼钢部二号化铁炉还创造了脱硫率达89％以上的新纪录。转炉炼钢工人采用双排风眼，脱硫效率也迅速提高到50％。为了千方百计战胜高硫，工人们还创造出电解脱硫，利用电炉渣、草木灰去硫，化铁炉采用高炉式炉底、化铁炉前炉增炭，以及用生白云石打炉衬等先进经验，其中仅电解脱硫一项，脱硫效率就达到60％。
    在生产大幅度上升和全面跃进的形势下，在职工群众思想觉悟普遍提高的基础上，大冶钢厂的企业管理工作，也得到了进一步地发展。从厂部到车间、工段，都建立了三班轮流值勤制，加强了对夜班生产的领导，作到了生产指挥不离现场。在计划管理方面，建立了一天两检查、一平衡，五天一分析、一评比、一部署的制度。所有这些，都大大增强了生产的组织性和战斗性，保证了生产全面持续地跃进。（附图片）
