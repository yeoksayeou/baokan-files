Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 25th: Since August, the No. 1 Steelmaking Workshop of Zhejiang Banshan Iron and Steel Plant has seen a significant decrease in the consumption of pig iron in converter steelmaking. In August, the iron consumption per ton of steel was 1,268 kilograms, a decrease of 221 kilograms compared to July; in September, it decreased by 70 kilograms compared to August, and the qualified rate of steel ingots reached 97.62%.

In order to use less iron and produce more steel, the Party organization of this workshop, focusing on key production issues, continuously summarized and promoted advanced experiences, which effectively promoted the reduction of iron consumption. Previously, Class C's iron consumption per ton of steel was only 1,238 kilograms, the lowest in the entire workshop. The workshop Party organization then organized Class C converter group and pig iron workers to perform operations and organized Class A and B to learn from them. After learning from the advanced, Class B's iron consumption quickly dropped to 1,190 kilograms, surpassing Class C, and Class A also approached Class B's level.

The workshop also focused on reducing iron consumption and achieving high-quality and high-yield, mobilized the masses to participate in management, established various operating procedures and necessary systems, achieved monthly and ten-day allocation of various raw material consumption quotas to the teams, regularly announced the completion status, and promoted a system of fixed consumption, fixed quality, fixed output, fixed posts, and fixed personnel, so that each worker has clear goals to strive for. These measures have also ensured the reduction of iron consumption.

    围绕生产关键不断总结推广先进经验
    半山钢铁厂铁耗大幅度下降
    据新华社杭州25日电　浙江半山钢铁厂第一炼钢车间8月份以来转炉钢的生铁消耗量大幅度下降。8月份每炼一吨钢的耗铁量为一千二百六十八公斤，比7月份减少二百二十一公斤；9月份比8月份降低了七十公斤，钢锭合格率达97.62％。
    为了少用铁多炼钢，这个车间的党组织围绕生产关键，不断总结推广先进经验，有力地促使铁耗下降。丙班每炼一吨钢耗铁量原来只有一千二百三十八公斤，是全车间最低的。车间党组织就组织丙班转炉小组和化铁工人，分别进行操作表演，组织甲乙班学习。经过学先进，乙班的铁耗很快降低到一千一百九十公斤，超过了丙班，甲班也接近了乙班水平。
    这个车间还围绕着降低铁耗，实现优质高产，发动群众参加管理，建立各种操作规程和必要的制度，做到按月、按旬向班组下达各种原料材料消耗定额指标，定期公布完成情况，并推行定消耗、定质量、定产量、定岗位、定人员的制度，每个工人都有明确的奋斗目标。这些措施也保证了铁耗的降低。
