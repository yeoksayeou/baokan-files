This newspaper Chongqing, October 8th - Workers of each group of Yutianpu Coal Mine in Chongqing City, universally formulated production group pledges, fixing various rules and regulations and various advanced experiences that are in line with promoting production development in the form of pledges, as a common criterion for everyone to abide by in production and work, making production management work truly established on the basis of mass consciousness. Over the past two months, these group pledges have achieved very good results in improving the level of enterprise management and promoting the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign.

While summing up the achievements and experiences of group management work, the leading cadres of Yutianpu Coal Mine carefully studied the new problems existing in group work, and found that the original operating procedures of some groups were not well implemented because they were not fully mobilized for mass discussion when they were formulated; Since the in-depth development of the technical revolution throughout the mine, some advanced experiences have not had time to be summarized and identified and incorporated into the operating procedures. As a result, the operating skills of the workers are not uniform enough, and there are many differences in technical operations between groups of the same type of work and between shifts of the same group, and the level of production also varies greatly.

The mine Party committee believes that in coal mines with strong production continuity, many types of work, and many processes, establishing a set of group operating procedures and rules and regulations that meet the needs of production and are consciously and strictly observed by the masses is an important key to ensuring the continuous and substantial increase in production throughout the mine. Therefore, the mine Party committee further relied on the masses to find solutions to the problems. The Party committee first discovered that the workers of the Ninth Coal Mining Group of the Third Mine and the Fifth Coal Mining Group of the First Mine seriously summarized and improved their experience in production practice, compiled them into a set, incorporated them into the regulations, and fixed them in the form of articles, calling it a pledge. After the pledge was formulated, everyone consciously and strictly abided by it, and production increased significantly. The mine Party committee affirmed this experience and immediately summarized it and promoted it throughout the mine.

When formulating the pledges, each production group proceeded from the current production needs, from solving the key to production and overcoming weak links, conscientiously summarized the rich experience gained since this year, discussed and studied the problems existing in current production and the measures to solve the problems. On this basis, the specific content of the group pledge was put forward by the members of each group, and the method of "three combinations" of cadres, workers, and technicians was adopted to study and sort out the opinions put forward by the masses, form articles, and then hand them over to the masses for discussion, supplementation and revision, and finally submitted to the leadership for approval and formal implementation. After the group pledges of many groups were approved, they held staff meetings, and everyone signed the pledges. The pledges of each production group stipulated the rules and regulations on technical operation procedures, safety regulations, and post responsibility system, and some group pledges also stipulated the basic systems for political and ideological work, production collaboration, and other aspects.

More than two months of practice have proved that the universal establishment of group pledges has a great effect on further improving the level of enterprise management and promoting a substantial increase in production. First of all, through the formulation of the pledge, the mine has established a set of technical regulations and rules and regulations with a deep mass base that are suitable for production development. Since the regulations and systems in the group pledge are adopted from the masses and back to the masses from the formulation to the implementation, the broad masses consciously and earnestly implement them. They said: "The pledge is made by ourselves, and we must do what we say." Many groups also check the implementation of the pledge on a daily and weekly basis, using mass supervision methods to ensure the implementation of the pledge. After the group pledge is conscientiously implemented, the work of each group in production, technology, safety production, production preparation and collaboration is well organized, the organization and discipline of the workers and masses are further strengthened, the phenomenon of non-uniform technical operations is greatly reduced or basically eliminated, and the sustained and substantial growth of production is effectively guaranteed.

Secondly, since the pledges of each group are generated on the basis of summarizing past experience, and many important advanced experiences and key solutions are incorporated into the pledges in a timely manner, this effectively turns the advanced production level into the production level of the masses.

Thirdly, through the formulation and implementation of group pledges, the communist spirit of cooperation of the broad masses of workers has been further promoted. Many groups have stipulated the system of doing production preparation work for the next shift, changing the phenomenon that some groups could not produce coal or produced less coal for three hours after taking over the shift in the past.

After the implementation of the group pledge by all groups in the mine, production has generally increased significantly. The output of raw coal and coke and the footage of tunneling of the whole mine increased by 5.16%, 58.37%, and 13.54% respectively in August compared with July; in September, they increased by 4%, 17.59%, and 11.9% respectively compared with August.

    把先进经验和重要措施制度化　把管理工作建立在群众自觉基础上
    鱼田堡煤矿普遍订立小组公约
    这种小组公约已在提高企业管理水平、推动增产节约运动方面收到很好效果
    本报重庆8日电　重庆市鱼田堡煤矿各小组的工人，普遍制定生产小组公约，把符合于促进生产发展的各种规章制度和各种先进经验，用公约形式固定下来，作为大家在生产和工作中共同遵守的准则，使生产管理工作真正建立在群众自觉的基础上。两个多月来，这种小组公约已经在提高企业管理水平、推动增产节约运动方面收到很好的效果。
    鱼田堡煤矿领导干部在总结小组管理工作的成就和经验的同时，认真研究了小组工作存在的新问题，发现有的小组原有的操作规程，由于制定时没有充分发动群众讨论，结果没有很好地贯彻执行；全矿深入开展技术革命以来，有些先进经验没有来得及总结鉴定，纳入操作规程。这样，职工的操作技术便不够统一，同工种的小组之间，同一小组的各班工人之间，技术操作都有不少差异，生产水平相差也比较大。
    矿党委认为，在生产连续性强、工种多、工序多的煤矿里，建立一套适合生产需要的为群众自觉地严格遵守的小组操作规程和规章制度，是保证全矿生产持续大幅度上升的重要关键。于是矿党委就进一步依靠群众，去寻找解决问题的办法。党委首先发现三井第九采煤组和一井第五采煤组的工人，把生产实践中的经验认真总结、提高，汇集成套，纳入规程，并用条文的形式固定下来，把它称为公约。公约制定以后，人人自觉严格遵守，生产显著上升。矿党委肯定了这一经验，并立即总结后在全矿推广。
    各个生产小组在制订公约时，都从当前的生产需要出发，从解决生产关键和克服薄弱环节出发，认真总结今年以来取得的丰富经验，讨论研究当前生产上存在的问题和解决问题的措施。在这个基础上，由各小组成员提出小组公约的具体内容，并采取干部、工人、技术人员“三结合”的办法，把群众提的意见加以研究整理，形成条文，再交给群众讨论，补充修改，最后送领导批准，正式执行。许多小组在本组公约批准以后，都举行了职工大会，大家都在公约上签字。各个生产小组的公约都规定了技术操作规程、安全规程、岗位责任制等规章制度，有些小组的公约还规定了政治思想工作、生产协作等方面的基本制度。
    两个多月的实践证明，普遍订立小组公约，对于进一步提高企业管理水平，推动生产大幅度上升，有很大的作用。首先，通过制订公约，全矿建立起了一套适合生产发展的有深厚群众基础的技术规程和规章制度。由于小组公约中的规程制度从制订到实施，都是采取从群众中来到群众中去的办法，因此广大群众都自觉地、认真地执行。他们说：“公约是自己订出来的，一定要说到办到。”许多小组还按天和按周检查公约执行情况，用群众监督的方法来保证公约贯彻执行。小组公约认真贯彻以后，各小组的生产、技术工作、安全生产、生产准备和协作等各方面的工作都井井有条，职工群众的组织性、纪律性进一步加强，技术操作不统一等现象大大减少或基本消灭，有力地保证了生产持续大幅度增长。
    其次，由于各小组的公约都是在总结以往经验的基础上产生的，及时把许多重要的先进经验和解决关键的措施纳入了公约，这便有效地把先进生产水平变成了群众的生产水平。
    第三，通过制订和实施小组公约，进一步发扬了广大职工的共产主义协作精神。许多小组都规定了为下一班做好生产准备工作的制度，改变了一些小组过去接班后三小时不能出煤或少出煤的现象。
    全矿各小组实行小组公约以后，生产普遍显著上升。全矿的原煤、焦炭产量和掘进进尺，8月份比7月份分别增长了5.16％、58.37％、13.54％；9月份又比8月份分别增长了4％、17.59％、11.9％。
