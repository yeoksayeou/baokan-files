    Discussion on the Periodization of Chinese Feudal Society

    Recently, in the past year or two, academic circles in China have gradually launched a discussion on the periodization (division into stages) of Chinese feudal society. This is an important issue in the study of the history of Chinese feudal society, and it is also one that urgently needs to be resolved for compiling Chinese history and conducting historical teaching. Scientifically dividing the development of Chinese feudal society into various stages will help us to deeply understand the characteristics of each stage, correctly reveal the laws of development of Chinese feudal society, and more deeply study all major aspects of the history of Chinese feudal society. At present, the periodization of Chinese slavery and feudalism has not yet been resolved, and the discussion on the periodization of Chinese feudal society will also help solve this problem.

    To solve the problem of periodization of feudal society, it is first necessary to establish correct periodization criteria. On this issue, historical circles have various opinions. Due to the different criteria for periodization held, and also due to disagreements on the periodization of slavery and feudalism, there are great differences in the specific division of various stages of feudal society. The following is a brief introduction to the various main different periodization opinions, according to their different periodization criteria.

    Periodization Based on the Development and Changes of Class Struggle

    Comrades who advocate this opinion believe that the periodization of feudal society is a periodization within a socio-economic formation. Throughout the entire feudal society, the basic characteristics of the feudal system, such as the feudal land ownership system and the dominant position of the natural economy, will not undergo fundamental changes. Therefore, the internal periodization of feudal society should not be based solely on changes in the social economy, but should comprehensively examine changes in all aspects of productive forces and production relations, economic base and superstructure, and take the class struggle of peasants, which centrally reflects these profound changes, as an important sign of periodization. Accordingly, some comrades divide Chinese feudal society into three stages. The first stage is from the Warring States period to the failure of the Yellow Turban Uprising (475 BC – 184 AD). In this stage, the characteristics of the peasant class struggle are: self-cultivating peasants fighting against dependency (main) and enslavement (secondary). After many peasant wars, the remnants of the slave system that hindered social development were further destroyed, the feudal economic system was consolidated and developed, and social productive forces were significantly improved. The second stage is from the failure of the Yellow Turban Uprising to the failure of the Huang Chao Uprising (184–884 AD). In this stage, the basic characteristics of the peasant class struggle are: peasants fighting against the heavy taxes and levies of feudal lords and the feudal state, and struggling to break away from feudal dependency. The Huang Chao Uprising shook the Tang Empire and destroyed the rule of aristocratic families and powerful clans, causing corresponding changes in the feudal land ownership system and dependency relations, thus becoming a boundary marker for dividing the second stage of feudal society. The third stage is from the failure of the Huang Chao Uprising to the Opium War (884–1840 AD). In this stage, the feudal state's land ownership system declined, and the landlord land ownership system occupied an absolute advantage; peasants had little or no land, the tenant system became increasingly popular, monetary rent began to appear, and personal dependency relations were relatively weakened; the sprouts of capitalism also began to emerge. From the Wang Xiaobo and Li Shun Uprising in the Northern Song Dynasty to the peasant wars at the end of the Ming Dynasty, slogans such as "equalizing wealth and poverty, equalizing status" and "equalizing land and exempting taxes" were put forward, indicating the peasants' demands for eliminating the landlord land ownership system and landlord rights; it also showed that the class struggle was more acute, and the peasants' revolutionary struggle had further developed. In the later stage of this period, there were also struggles of urban citizens against feudal oppression. These are the basic characteristics of this stage.

    In addition, some comrades divide feudal society into two, four, and nine periods, taking peasant uprisings as a symbol.

    Periodization Based on the Mode of Production and Class Struggle as a Clue

    Comrades who advocate this view believe that the mode of production is the foundation of social development, and class struggle is the driving force for the continuous development of the mode of production. Therefore, to understand the development process of Chinese feudal society, it is necessary to conduct a unified examination of the two. Accordingly, they divide Chinese feudal society into four periods. (1) The formation period of feudal society—from the Warring States period to the Yellow Turban Uprising. During this period, the land ownership system was the landlord land ownership system and the feudal state land ownership system. The purpose of the peasant uprising was to demand personal freedom, liberate slaves, and restore the economic status of small producers. After many peasant uprisings, the feudal ownership system was consolidated, and slave labor, which hindered the development of production, gradually disappeared. (2) The consolidation period of feudal society—from the Yellow Turban Uprising to the An Lushan Rebellion. The main historical content of this period is the rise and fall of the ownership of land by aristocratic landlords. The manor economy of aristocratic landlords was the main economic foundation of this period. Within the manors of aristocratic landlords, personal dependency relations and subordinate relations were further strengthened, and the feudal ownership system was further consolidated. The purpose of peasant uprisings in this period was mainly to oppose feudal exploitation and the strengthening of feudal dependency. (3) The development period of feudal society—from the An Lushan Rebellion to the peasant uprising at the end of the Yuan Dynasty. During this period, the land ownership of commoner landlords became the main land ownership. The development of commodity production, as well as the resulting intense land annexation, the strengthening of the central government, and the acuteness of class struggle, are the basic contents of this period. As a symbol of the development of the feudal system, it is the development of commodity production in the field of feudal ownership. (4) The decline period of feudal society—from the peasant uprising at the end of the Yuan Dynasty to the Opium War. The main feature of this period is the emergence of capitalist sprouts on the basis of the development of commodity production. From the early Ming Dynasty to the Opium War, although the sprouts of capitalism were only limited to a few handicraft productions in individual regions, its emergence forced the feudal relations of production to partially disintegrate. The emergence of this new element, which is the opposite of feudalism, symbolizes that feudal society is approaching disintegration.

    In addition, some comrades advocate dividing the history of Chinese feudal society into various periods based mainly on the development law of the mode of production in feudal society, and using revolutionary struggles or major events with significant influence as boundary markers. They believe that from the initial tax on mu in 594 BC to the Yellow Turban Uprising was the formation period of Chinese feudal society, from the Yellow Turban Uprising to the Red Turban Uprising was the development period, and from the Red Turban Uprising to the Opium War was the late period of feudal society.

    Periodization Based on Changes and Development of Production Relations

    Comrades who advocate this view believe that production relations determine the nature of society. Historically, changes and development in social productive forces, and the class struggle of peasants against landlords, are inevitably reflected in the changes and development of production relations. Accordingly, Chinese feudal society can be divided into three periods and four stages. (1) The Western Zhou to the Warring States period was the early feudal society. The production relations at that time were mainly the exploitation of serfs by lords in agriculture, followed by the exploitation of cultivating slaves; in handicrafts, it was the complete possession of handicraft slaves by lords. This is consistent with the situation where the low level of productive forces requires the exploiters to impose a high degree of coercion on the exploited. In addition, the small private economy of folk handicrafts is compatible with the process of serfs freeing themselves into peasants. By the Warring States period, folk handicrafts had reached a considerable scale. (2) The Qin and Han dynasties to the Northern and Southern dynasties were the former stage of the middle feudal society. Generally speaking, the production relations at that time were mainly the exploitation of peasants by landlords in agriculture, followed by the exploitation of cultivating slaves; in handicrafts, it was mainly folk handicrafts, followed by the exploitation of industrial slaves by landlords and large industrialists and merchants. Although the productive forces were significantly improved compared with the previous period, the existence of slave labor was still in a state of "carrying forward" from the previous period. (3) The Sui and Tang dynasties to the end of the Yuan dynasty were the latter stage of the middle feudal society. At that time, slave labor in agriculture and handicrafts was no longer an obstacle to the production relations, so the small private economy was able to accelerate its progress, all the way to the beginning of the factory handicraft industry. This period was still in a state of "enlightening the future" for the next period. (4) The Ming dynasty to before the Opium War in the Qing dynasty was the late feudal society. At that time, in addition to the exploitation of peasants by landlords being basically similar to that in the latter stage of the middle period, capitalist production relations appeared in industrial factories. Although this sprout of capitalism was far from generating the power to destroy the feudal system, it would eventually arise, and the pioneers of the working class had already foreseen this power. The feudal society was already pregnant with the initial form of the new society.

    In addition, some comrades advocate dividing the history of Chinese feudal society into the following four stages: (1) The early stage of feudal society—Western Zhou to Western Han, from the tenth century BC to the beginning of the first century AD. (2) The mature period of feudal society—Eastern Han to late Tang, from the first century AD to the ninth century. (3) The late stage of feudal society—Song to the Opium War, from the tenth century AD to the mid-nineteenth century. (4) The semi-feudal and semi-colonial period—Opium War to the national liberation, 1840 to 1949.

    Still other comrades believe that: the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties were the early stage of Chinese feudal society, that is, the period of the emergence and formation of Chinese feudal society; the Tang, Song and Yuan dynasties were the middle period, that is, the period of development of Chinese feudal society; the Ming and Qing dynasties were the late period, that is, the period of disintegration of Chinese feudal society.

    Periodization Based on the Development and Change of Feudal Land Ownership

    Some comrades advocate conducting a comprehensive examination from the economic base to the superstructure, and using the change of feudal land ownership as the basis and the fixation of the legal code as the sign to divide the various periods of feudal society. They take the middle of the Tang Dynasty as the dividing line, and divide Chinese feudal society (from the Qin Dynasty to before the Opium War in the Qing Dynasty) into two stages: the former and the latter. They believe that by the eighth century, the development of the feudal economy showed a clear stage. This is reflected in the land ownership, which is the change of the form of imperial land management from political (immigrant reclamation, land occupation and equal land distribution), military (military reclamation) rule to economic (official land, imperial land, official manors and imperial manors, etc.) rule under the dominant form of the royal family's land ownership; the form of land rent is the further development of rent in kind; the development of the ruling class is from the political monopoly of the status-based landlord class (aristocratic families, famous families and large surnames) to the increase of the opportunity for landlords to participate in politics with non-status-based colors; in the struggle of the working people, it is from the call for status liberation to the call for equal ownership; in terms of government-run handicrafts, the original corvée system and management forms have undergone significant changes. That is to say, from all aspects, the development of Chinese feudal society to the eighth century has shifted from the previous period to the latter period.

    Periodization Based on the Development and Change of the Feudal State Regime

    Comrades who advocate using the division and separatism of the state and the establishment and development of a unified centralized state as the dividing line for periodization believe that Chinese feudal society can be divided into the following three periods. (1) The early Middle Ages of China—from King Wu's defeat of Yin to the demise of the Western Zhou Dynasty was the formation period of feudalism in our country. This period can be divided into two paragraphs. The first paragraph is from the early Zhou Dynasty to the time of King Mu of Zhou. The feudal relations of production began to be established, the feudal land ownership system appeared, and the natural economy was very prevalent. The second paragraph is from the middle of the Western Zhou Dynasty to the demise of the Western Zhou Dynasty. Feudalization was strengthened, the peasantization of free peasants and serfs was completed, and the social division of labor began to develop. Its historical direction was towards feudal separatism. (2) The development period of the Chinese feudal system—including from the eastward relocation of King Ping to the Five Dynasties. It can be divided into two main stages, namely, the feudal separatist stage and the centralized stage. The feudal separatist stage can be divided into two paragraphs. The first paragraph is from the eastward relocation of King Ping to the end of the Spring and Autumn Period. During this period, the royal power declined, the princes annexed each other, the feudal cities grew up, and the political unity of large areas formed twelve major countries. The second paragraph is the Warring States period. During this period, handicrafts and commerce further developed, the private land ownership system was formed, the urban class appeared on the historical stage, and the requirements for national political unity were put forward. The centralized stage of the feudal development period, from the unification of Qin to the great chaos of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms, can be divided into six paragraphs. The first paragraph is from the unification of Qin to the Yellow Turban Uprising, which is the era when centralization began; the second paragraph is from the ascension of Emperor Xian of Han to the unification of the Western Jin Dynasty, which is the era when economic division led to national division; the third paragraph is the unification of the Western Jin Dynasty, which is the era when the growth of the southern economy and the strengthening of the national economic interdependence achieved unification; the fourth paragraph is from the Eastern Jin Dynasty to the unification of the Sui Dynasty, which is the era when internal ethnic contradictions caused political division; the fifth paragraph is the Sui and Tang dynasties, which is the era when centralization was further strengthened; the sixth paragraph is the late Tang and Five Dynasties, which is the era when the long-term feudal wars of the feudal development period ended. (3) The decline period of the Chinese feudal system—the stage of the formation of the autocratic monarchy. This period can be divided into four paragraphs; the first paragraph is the formation of the autocratic monarchy (the two Songs), and the clear boundary marker of the late Middle Ages is the realization of the autocratic monarchy (starting from the unification of the Northern Song Dynasty), and the sprouts of capitalism also appeared at this time; the second paragraph is the collapse of productive forces under the rule of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty; the third paragraph is the Ming Dynasty, when the sprouts of capitalism grew; the fourth paragraph is the sluggish economic development under the rule of the Qing Dynasty.

    In addition to the above views, some comrades advocate dividing Chinese feudal society into three periods according to economic characteristics. From the Warring States period to the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the natural economy was prevalent, which was the early stage of feudal society; after the Sui and Tang dynasties, it entered the middle stage of feudal society, and the formation of the guild system was a prominent symbol of the separation of urban and rural areas in this period; from the middle of the Ming Dynasty to the Opium War, it was the late stage of feudal society, and its characteristic was the emergence of capitalist sprouts.

    From the above situation, the discussion on the periodization of Chinese feudal society has just begun and needs to be further developed. The situation of the discussion shows that there are great differences. Not only are the periodization criteria very different, but also the views on the main characteristics of Chinese feudal society and its various stages of development are also very inconsistent. Therefore, there are different periodization opinions for different periodization criteria, and there are also different periodization understandings for the same periodization criteria. In order to make the discussion of the periodization issue more in-depth, we should first seek a correct periodization standard according to the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism on social historical development; we should pay special attention to studying the contradictions between productive forces and production relations, the contradictions between the superstructure and the economic base, and the class struggle that profoundly reflects these contradictions, and reveal the stages of development of Chinese feudal society from the changes and developments of these contradictions; we should explore the main characteristics of the political and economic systems of each stage more deeply, and clarify the development process of Chinese feudal society. In past discussions, some only generally discussed the issue of periodization, and the analysis and generalization of historical facts was insufficient; some only divided the stages according to a single economic phenomenon or political phenomenon, and did not pay attention to dialectically examining all aspects of social development; some, when studying the issue of periodization, had not completely got rid of the influence of the old view of dividing periods according to the rise and fall of dynasties. These shortcomings need to be overcome in future discussions. Shi Shaobin

    关于中国封建社会分期问题的讨论
    最近一两年，我国历史学界逐渐展开了关于中国封建社会分期（划分阶段）问题的讨论。这是研究中国封建社会历史的一个重要问题，也是编著中国历史和进行历史教学迫切需要解决的问题之一。科学地划分中国封建社会发展的各个阶段，将帮助我们深刻地了解各个阶段的特点，正确地揭示中国封建社会的发展规律，更深入地研究中国封建社会历史的各个主要方面。目前，中国奴隶制和封建制分期问题尚未解决，中国封建社会分期问题的讨论还将有助于这个问题的解决。
    要解决封建社会的分期问题，首先要确立正确的分期标准。在这个问题上，史学界有各种不同的意见。由于所持分期的标准不一，也由于在奴隶制和封建制分期问题上意见不一致，所以在具体划分封建社会各个阶段时就有很大分歧。现将各种主要不同的分期意见，按其分期标准的不同简介于下。
    以阶级斗争的发展变化作为标准的分期
    主张这种意见的同志认为，封建社会的分期问题是一种社会经济形态以内的分期。在整个封建社会中，封建制度的基本特征，如封建土地所有制和自然经济的统治地位等，是不会有根本的变化的，因而不应该单纯以社会经济的变化作为封建社会内部分期的标准，而应当全面地考察生产力和生产关系、经济基础和上层建筑各个方面的变化，并以集中反映这些深刻变化的农民的阶级斗争作为分期的重要标志。据此，有的同志把中国封建社会划分为三个阶段。第一阶段，从战国到黄巾大起义失败（公元前475—公元184年）。在这一阶段中，农民的阶级斗争特点是：自耕农民进行反对依附化（主要的）和奴隶化（次要的）的斗争。经过多次的农民战争，阻碍社会发展的奴隶制残余进一步被摧毁了，封建经济制度得到了巩固和发展，社会生产力有了显著的提高。第二阶段，从黄巾大起义失败到黄巢大起义失败（公元184—884年）。在这一阶段中，农民阶级斗争的基本特征是：农民反对封建主和封建国家的沉重赋役，为挣脱封建依附关系而斗争。黄巢大起义震撼了唐帝国，摧毁了世族门阀和豪族的统治，使封建土地所有制和依附关系发生了相应的变化，因此成为划分封建社会第二阶段下限的界标。第三阶段，从黄巢起义失败到鸦片战争（公元884—1840年）。在这一阶段中，封建国家土地所有制日益衰落，地主土地所有制居于绝对优势地位；农民很少土地或没有土地，租佃制日益广泛流行，货币地租开始出现，人身依附关系相对削弱了；资本主义的萌芽也开始产生。从北宋王小波、李顺起义到明末农民战争，提出了“均贫富等贵贱”、“均田免赋”等口号，表明了农民消灭地主土地所有制和地主权利的要求；同时也表明了阶级斗争更加尖锐了，农民的革命斗争有了进一步的发展。在这个阶段的后期，还发生了城镇市民反封建压迫的斗争。这些都是这一阶段的基本特征。
    此外，还有同志以农民起义为标志，把封建社会分为两期、四期和九期。
    以生产方式为基础、阶级斗争为线索作为标准的分期
    主张这种意见的同志认为，生产方式是社会发展的基础，推动生产方式不断发展的是阶级斗争，因而要了解中国封建社会的发展过程，必须对二者进行统一的考察。据此，他们把中国封建社会分为四期。（一）封建社会的形成时期——战国到黄巾起义。这时期的土地所有制是地主土地所有制和封建的国家土地所有制。农民起义的目的，是要求人身自由，解放奴婢，恢复小生产者的经济地位。经过多次的农民起义，巩固了封建所有制，使阻碍生产发展的奴隶劳动渐趋消失。（二）封建社会的巩固时期——黄巾起义到安史之乱。这时期的主要历史内容是世族地主所有制的兴起和衰落。世族地主的庄园经济是这时期的主要经济基础。在世族地主庄园之内，人身依附关系、隶属关系是更强化了，封建所有制是更巩固了。这时期农民起义的目的，主要是反对封建剥削和封建依附的强化。（三）封建社会的发展时期——从安史之乱到元末农民大起义。这个时期庶族地主所有制成为主要的土地所有制。商品生产的发展，以及因此而引起的土地兼并的激烈，中央政权的强化，阶级斗争的尖锐，是这一时期的基本内容。作为封建制发展的标志，则是在封建所有制领域内商品生产的发展。（四）封建社会的衰落时期——元末农民大起义到鸦片战争。这时期的主要特征是，在商品生产发展的基础上，出现了资本主义萌芽。自明初到鸦片战争以前，资本主义的萌芽虽然还只局限于个别地区的几门手工业生产，但是它的出现却使封建生产关系不得不部分地发生分解。这种作为封建主义对立物的新的因素的出现，正是象征着封建社会已接近解体。
    另外，还有同志主张以封建社会生产方式的发展规律为主要根据，以具有重大影响的革命斗争或重大事件为界标，来划分封建社会的各个时期。他们认为，从公元前594年初税亩到黄巾起义为中国封建社会的形成期，从黄巾起义以后到红巾起义为发展期，从红巾起义以后到鸦片战争为封建社会的晚期。
    以生产关系的变更和发展作为标准的分期
    主张这种意见的同志认为，决定社会性质的是生产关系。历史上社会生产力的变更和发展，农民反对地主的阶级斗争，都必然反映到生产关系的变更和发展上面来。据此，中国封建社会可以分为三期四大段。（一）西周到战国为初期封建社会。当时的生产关系，在农业方面主要是领主对农奴的剥削，其次才是对耕种奴隶的剥削；在手工业方面是领主对手工业奴隶的完全占有。这和生产力的低微使得剥削者对被剥削者必须加以高度强制力的情形是相符合的。此外，小私有经济的民间手工业和农奴解脱为农民的过程相适应。到战国时，民间手工业已达到相当的规模。（二）秦汉至南北朝为中期封建社会的前段。当时的生产关系，一般而言，在农业方面主要是地主对农民的剥削，其次才是对耕种奴隶的剥削；在手工业方面主要是民间手工业，其次才是地主和大工商业者对工业奴隶的剥削。生产力虽比前一时期显著提高了，而奴隶劳动的存在对前一时期还处在“承前”状态中。（三）隋唐至元末为中期封建社会的后段。当时的生产关系，在农业手工业方面奴隶劳动已经不成为障碍，因此小私有经济得以加速进展，一直到工场手工业的开始。这一时期对后一时期还处在“启后”的状态中。（四）明至清鸦片战争以前为后期封建社会。当时的生产关系，除了地主对农民的剥削和中期后段基本上相似以外，在工业工场里出现了资本主义的生产关系。这种资本主义的萌芽因素虽然远没有产生破坏封建制度的力量，但是它迟早是会产生的，工人阶级的先驱者已经预示了这个力量。封建社会里已经怀妊了新社会的初形胎儿。
    此外，有的同志主张把中国封建社会的历史分为以下四个阶段：（一）封建社会前期——西周到西汉，公元前十世纪到公元初。（二）封建社会的成熟期——东汉到晚唐，公元一世纪到九世纪。（三）封建社会后期——宋到鸦片战争，公元十世纪到十九世纪中。（四）半封建半殖民地时期——鸦片战争到全国解放，1840到1949年。
    还有同志认为：魏晋南北朝是中国封建社会的早期，即中国封建社会产生和形成时期；唐宋元为中期，即中国封建社会发展时期；明清为晚期，即中国封建社会解体时期。
    以封建土地所有制的发展变化作为标准的分期
    有的同志主张，从经济基础到上层建筑进行全面考察，而以封建土地所有制的变化为基础，以法典的固定化为标志，来划分封建社会的各个时期。他们以唐中叶为分界线，将中国封建社会（自秦至清鸦片战争前）划为前后两个阶段。他们认为，中国历史到了第八世纪，封建经济的发展就显示出明白的阶段性。这表现在土地所有制上，是在土地皇族所有制成为支配形式下，皇族经营土地的形式从政治的（移民垦田、占田和均田）、军事的（军屯）统治形式，到经济的（官田、皇田、官庄和皇庄等）统治形式的变化；表现在地租形态上，是实物地租进一步的发展；表现在统治阶级内部的发展上，是从身份性的地主阶级（世族、名门和大姓）的政权垄断，到带有非身份性色彩的地主参政机会的加多；表现在劳动人民的斗争上，是从身份解放的号召，到平均所有的号召；表现在官办手工业方面，原有的劳役制和经营形式等都起了显著的变化。这就是说，从各方面看来，中国封建社会发展到第八世纪，已经由前一个时期转入了后一个时期。
    以封建国家政权的发展变化作为标准的分期
    主张以国家的分裂割据和统一的中央集权国家之建立和发展作为分期界线的同志认为，中国封建社会可以划分为以下三期。（一）中国的早期中世纪——从武王克殷到西周灭亡是我国封建制的形成时期。这一时期可划分为两个段落。第一段落从周初到周穆王时，封建制生产关系开始建立，出现了封建土地所有制，自然经济很盛行。第二段落从西周中年到西周灭亡，封建化加强了，自由农民农奴化完成，社会分工开始发展，其历史方向是走向封建割据。（二）中国的封建制发展时期——包括从平王东迁到五代。其间可分为两个主要阶段，即封建割据阶段和中央集权阶段。封建割据阶段又可分为两个段落。第一段落从平王东迁到春秋末年，这时期王权衰落，诸侯兼并，封建城市成长起来，大地区的政治统一，形成十二大国。第二段落是战国时代，这时期手工业和商业进一步发展，土地私有制形成，市民阶层出现于历史舞台，全国政治统一的要求被提出来了。封建发展时期的中央集权阶段从秦统一开始到五代十国大混战止，可分为六个段落。第一段落是从秦统一到黄巾起义，为中央集权开始的时代；第二段落是从汉献帝即位到西晋统一，为由经济上的割裂性导致国家分裂的时代；第三段落是西晋的统一，为由南方经济的成长，全国经济上互相依赖的加强达成统一的时代；第四段落是东晋到隋统一，为由于内部种族矛盾造成政治分裂的时代；第五段落是隋唐两代，为中央集权进一步加强的时代；第六段落是唐末五代，为结束封建制发展时期的长期封建战争时代。（三）中国的封建制衰落时期——君主专制政制形成的阶段。这一时期可分为四个段落；第一段落是君主专制政制的形成（两宋），晚期中世纪的显明界标是君主专制政制的实现（开始于北宋的统一），这时资本主义萌芽也已出现；第二段落是蒙元统治下生产力的崩溃；第三段落是明代，资本主义萌芽增长；第四段落是清朝统治下经济发展的迟滞。
    除了上述几种意见以外，还有同志主张根据经济特征把中国封建社会分为三期。从战国到南北朝，自然经济盛行，是封建社会的早期；隋唐以后进入封建社会的中期，行会制度的形成是这一时期城乡分离的显著标志；从明中叶到鸦片战争是封建社会的晚期，其特征是资本主义萌芽的出现。
    从上述情况看来，中国封建社会分期问题的讨论才刚刚开始，还有待于进一步地展开。讨论的情况说明，存在的分歧是很大的。不仅分期标准极不相同，而且对中国封建社会及其各个发展阶段的主要特点的看法也很不一致。因此，分期标准不同的有不同的分期意见，分期标准相同的也有不同的分期见解。为了使分期问题的讨论能够更加深入，首先应该根据马克思列宁主义关于社会历史发展的基本观点，寻求一个正确的分期标准；应该特别注意研究生产力和生产关系的矛盾，上层建筑和经济基础的矛盾，以及深刻反映这种矛盾的阶级斗争，从这些矛盾的变化发展，揭示中国封建社会发展的阶段性；应该更深入地探讨各阶段政治经济制度的主要特征，阐明中国封建社会的发展过程。在过去的讨论中，有的仅一般地论述分期问题，对历史事实进行分析概括不够；有的仅根据某一单纯的经济现象或政治现象来划分阶段，不注意辩证地考察社会发展的各个方面；有的在研究分期问题时，还没有完全摆脱旧的按王朝兴衰分期的观点的影响。对于这些缺点，都需要在今后讨论中加以克服。　史绍宾
