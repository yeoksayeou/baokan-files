Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The National Committee of the CPPCC held a soiree tonight to welcome returned overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations. More than 400 overseas Chinese compatriots from Asia, Africa, Europe, America and Australia, as well as Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, attended the soiree.

Guo Moruo, Li Weihan, and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the National Committee of the CPPCC, met with heads of various overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots groups before the soiree.

Guo Moruo spoke during the meeting. He first extended a heartfelt welcome to the overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots on behalf of the National Committee of the CPPCC. He said: This year's National Day is a double celebration. On the one hand, we are celebrating our glorious National Day. At the same time, we have signed a border treaty with our friendly neighbor, the Union of Burma, which has successfully resolved the border issues left over from the history of China and Burma. Everyone must be as happy as our domestic compatriots in celebrating this. He also said that we have signed a treaty of friendship and non-aggression with the Kingdom of Afghanistan and a treaty of peace and friendship with the Kingdom of Nepal. This time, we have signed a border treaty with the Union of Burma, which has set an example for peaceful coexistence. We hope to expand the cause of peace.

Finally, Guo Moruo talked about the great victory of the motherland's construction. He asked the overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots who came to Beijing to tell the overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots: Our 650 million people in China are united in building our great motherland under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, under the glorious illumination of the general line. Our country is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong, and our friends are all over the world. All this is worthy of rejoicing for our overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots.

The overseas Chinese representatives and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots who were received warmly applauded Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's speech.

A dance drama was performed at the soiree.

Also present at today's soiree were responsible persons from the National Committee of the CPPCC, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese: Zhang Zhiyi, Cai Tingkai, Shao Lizi, Fang Fang, Zhuang Xiquan, Huang Changshui, Zhuang Mingli, and others.
