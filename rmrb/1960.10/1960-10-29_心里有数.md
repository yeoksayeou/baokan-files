Knowing What's What
Jiao Hewen

    Yang Shifu, the "good housekeeper" of the Bianduli Production Team of the Wenmiao Commune in Jiahe County, Hebei, became a "canteen advisor," and people said he had a broad mind and keen insight. He often said, "Managing a household depends on calculation. A steady stream lasts long, and you won't have to worry about food and clothing, right? Killing a chicken means only one meal, but raising chickens means you can eat eggs for a long time." Everyone nodded in agreement. He actively promoted the "knowing ten months in advance" and "ten-day meal plan" systems, so the commune members ate their fill, ate well, and saved money.

    However, there are also some people in the countryside who "live with their eyes closed," having no idea of what's what, spending lavishly. They say, "When the car reaches the mountain, there will be a road."

    Of course, making sure the masses are fed and clothed, and live a happy life, is the Party's long-standing concern for the people's livelihood; one person in trouble, everyone helps, this is the superiority of our social system. However, we must not think that just because we have these, we can "live with our eyes closed," always feeling that with the Party backing us, someone will help, and with the commune as our support, we don't have to worry about not having a road in front of the mountain, as long as we reach out at the time, "there is no Flame Mountain that cannot be crossed." Thinking and acting this way is a big mistake. The People's Commune is everyone's home, and socialism is the people's cause. To build socialism well, we must rely on everyone's efforts and not have dependent thoughts. "When the car reaches the mountain, there will be a road," but the road is made by people. If there is no road, we must find one, open one. This is the truth.

    Managing a household is like driving a car, listening to the Party, seeing tomorrow and the day after, taking one step and looking two, or even ten, steps ahead. Diligence and thrift come first, and all roads lead to paradise.

    Whether there is a road in front of the mountain depends on the people. If you want "when the car reaches the mountain, there will be a road," you must not develop the habit of "only reaching out and not lifting a finger." Managing a household is like this: counting on your fingers, you'll never get poorer; opening your palms, you'll never get richer. Doing it yourself, thinking the worst, doing the best, knowing what's what, being grounded, striving for the initiative, then life will get better and better.

    Managing a household means being a "hands-on faction," not a "reach-out faction." These are two roads, two standpoints, two kinds of thinking, two kinds of methods, and the result is one forward and one backward, one gain and one loss. The correct approach is to promote the "poor stick" spirit.

    I admire cadres like this: leading the masses to live their lives, seeing far, thinking comprehensively, "not seeking temporary applause, but only hoping for silent nods of approval in the future." Speaking of which, the "canteen advisor" was right: a steady stream lasts long, and you won't have to worry about food and clothing.

    心里有数
    焦合文
    河北交河县文庙公社扁渡里生产队“过日子能手”杨世符当上了“食堂顾问”，人们都说他心境大、眼力高。他常说：“过日子就凭个算计劲，细水长流，吃穿不愁，不是吗？杀鸡只能吃一顿，养鸡才能长吃蛋。”说得大家直点头。积极推行了“十个月早知道”和“十日饭表”制，社员们吃饱、吃好、又节约。
    可是，农村里也有个别“闭着眼睛过日子”的人，心里没底没数，吃用大手大脚，他们说：“车到山前必有路。”
    当然，让群众吃饱、穿暖，过幸福生活，这是党关心人民生活的老主意；一人有难，众人相帮，这是咱们社会制度的优越性。可是，万不能以为有了这些，就可以“闭上眼睛过日子”，总觉着反正有党撑腰，有人帮忙，有公社这个靠山，不愁山前没有路，只要到时候伸手要，“没有过不去的火焰山”。这样想，这样做，真是大错特错了。人民公社是大伙的家，社会主义是人民的事业，要把社会主义建设好，就要靠大家出力，不能有依赖思想。“车到山前必有路”，但是，路是人走出来的，没有路，就得找路、开路，这才是真理。
    过日子也像行车赶路一样，听党的话，今天看到明天、后天，走一步看两步，甚至是看十步，勤俭当先，条条大路通天堂。
    车到山前有没有路，决定在人。要想“车到山前必有路”，就不能养成“光伸手不动手”的脾气。过日子就是这样：数着指头过，没有越过越穷的，张着巴掌过，没有越过越富的。自己动手，从坏处想，往好处做，心里有数，脚下有根，争取主动，日子才会越过越好。
    过日子要作“动手派”，不做“伸手派”，这是两条道路，两个立场，两种思想，两种方法，结果是一进一退，一得一失。正确的做法是：发扬“穷棒子”精神。
    我就信服这样的干部：领着群众过日子，看的远，想的全，“不图一时乱拍手，只求他日暗点头”。说起来，还是那位“食堂顾问”说得有理：细水长流，吃穿不愁。
