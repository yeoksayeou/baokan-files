Wheat-Cotton Intercropping for Double Harvest
    Agricultural Meteorology Research Office, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
    In all cotton-producing areas of our country, there exists a contradiction of competition for land between grain and cotton. In most areas, where the frost-free period is less than 300 days, direct sowing of cotton after harvesting wheat is impossible; while sowing wheat after harvesting cotton will reduce wheat production. How can we achieve a double harvest of both grain and cotton? Wheat-cotton intercropping is a good solution. Wheat-cotton intercropping involves sowing wheat in three to four-foot wide strips, leaving corresponding empty rows, and then sowing three to four rows of cotton in the empty rows the following year.
    Many experiences have proven that, under good water and fertilizer conditions, intercropping can obtain high and stable yields. According to experiments conducted by the Fenghuo People's Commune in Qian County, Shaanxi Province, with all measures being the same as in the open field, wheat-cotton intercropping has achieved bumper harvests in recent years: In 1959, the average wheat yield per mu was 514 jin (calculated based on the actual sown area, same below), an increase of 119% compared to the open field; seed cotton was 576.6 jin, an increase of 36% compared to the open field. In 1960, the average wheat yield per mu on a large area of 50 mu was 892 jin, an increase of 75% compared to the open field.

    Creates a Better Environment for Wheat and Cotton Growth
    The reason for the increased yield of wheat-cotton intercropping mainly lies in resolving the contradiction between close planting and light and ventilation. Intercropping increases the edge rows, which also increases the area directly exposed to sunlight. For example, taking a 100-foot long, three-foot wide sowing strip, the area exposed to sunlight in the later stages of wheat and cotton growth can increase by 170% compared to ordinary wheat fields, with the area receiving direct solar radiation increasing by about 50%. At the same time, after planting in strips, inter-plant transmission is also greatly enhanced. In general fields, during the later stages of wheat and cotton growth, the inter-plant radiation intensity only reaches 1-5% of natural radiation; however, in the center of the intercropped wheat and cotton strips (the most shaded area), the inter-plant radiation intensity can reach 10-20% of natural radiation. Especially compared to open fields, intercropped wheat and cotton strips have particularly high early morning and late evening transmission, and early morning and late evening sunlight is most easily utilized for photosynthesis. For example, according to actual measurements, the inter-plant transmittance of cotton in early August (peak boll stage) in the central part of the intercropped area is 10-15% higher than in the open field in the morning and evening, and about 5% higher than in the open field at noon. The situation is similar for wheat in the later stages.
    Due to the increase in the area receiving solar radiation and the transmittance rate, not only is crop photosynthesis promoted, but also the field temperature is increased. In addition, the better ventilation of intercropping allows the field air to remain relatively dry in the later stages. From the jointing stage to maturity of wheat and after the cotton closes its ridges, the relative humidity of the air in the intercropped field is generally 10-15% lower than in the open field.
    These differences in the microclimate between intercropping and open fields improve the living conditions of the crops. Solar radiation is evenly distributed in the field, making photosynthesis vigorous, so wheat has more tillers, larger ears, more grains, and heavier grains; cotton has more buds and larger bolls.

    Intercropped Wheat and Cotton Have Stronger Stress Resistance
    Intercropped wheat and cotton also show stronger stress resistance. For wheat, the most prominent point is that intercropped wheat is less prone to lodging. Judging from the stem characteristics, intercropped wheat, especially its edge rows, has thick stems, short nodes, and strong resistance to breakage, showing obvious lodging resistance.
    The biggest feature of intercropped cotton is that it has less bud and boll shedding. Wheat-cotton intercropping has a certain period of staggered growth, which is about forty to fifty days in the North China region. Cotton seedlings growing in the wheat strips during this stage are shaded by the wheat strips, and the temperature in the field is slightly lower than in the open field due to the influence of the wheat strips. These unfavorable conditions slow down the development of cotton seedlings in the early stage and reduce the number of buds in the early stage (but it is different in places with more spring winds and cold waves, the wheat strips can mitigate the temperature drop and wind speed, which has a protective effect on cotton seedlings and is therefore beneficial), but after the wheat harvest, the sunlight and ventilation conditions are much better than in the open field. In July and August, buds and bolls generally shed severely in the open field, while shedding is less in intercropped areas, and more buds appear. Therefore, the final yield of intercropped cotton is still higher than in the open field.
    Intercropped crops grow vigorously and have strong disease resistance. At the same time, stronger sunlight and lower air humidity also inhibit the development of pathogens. Investigations show that wheat rust occurs less often in intercropped areas, and cotton boll rot is less frequent.
    Intercropped wheat and cotton have greater adaptability to climate change. For example, the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, where the Fenghuo Commune is located, suffered from drought last year, but this summer has been continuously rainy, but in these two years with completely different conditions, the intercropped crops have performed very well. The reason is that, on the one hand, intercropped crops grow more vigorously and have greater stress resistance; on the other hand, the water condition of the intercropped field is better - in dry years, due to the small transpiration area and low total water consumption, the lower layers of the soil can retain more water; in flood years, the higher ground temperature and good ventilation accelerate evaporation, which can keep the ground and near-ground air relatively dry.
    In general, by using the intercropping method, it is possible to obtain a bumper harvest with greater certainty. According to some survey materials, intercropping can make one mu of land exert the effect of one and a half or even two mu, thus solving the contradiction of competition for land between grain and cotton. In addition, intercropping wheat in cotton fields can also reduce the amount of wheat grown in rotation, which can alleviate the tension in labor during the autumn harvest and sowing season. Due to the enhanced stress resistance of intercropped wheat and cotton, a series of field management procedures can be omitted, such as remedial measures after wheat lodging, pushing and merging cotton plants, and removing old leaves; and it is also much more convenient to operate and manage in the empty rows than in general fields. According to the experience of the Fenghuo Commune in recent years, wheat-cotton intercropping not only does not cost labor, but saves labor. Wheat-cotton intercropping is a cropping system worth promoting.

    Issues to Note to Maximize Intercropping Potential
    In order to better realize the yield-increasing potential of wheat-cotton intercropping, the following issues should also be noted when using this method:
    1.  How wide should the wheat and cotton strips be?
    There are many places with the habit of wheat and cotton intercropping, and the strip widths used vary from place to place. According to our research, neither too wide nor too narrow wheat and cotton strips can achieve the greatest yield increase. The yield-increasing effect of intercropping mainly lies in its ability to increase edge rows and exert marginal effects. According to actual measurement results, solar radiation weakens from the edge rows to the middle in the open field; for wheat, it weakens after about two chi, and for cotton, it weakens after about the third row, becoming similar to the center of the open field. Plant traits also show differences from the center of the field within this range, so the marginal effect range is about two to three chi wide. If the intercropping strip is too wide (five or six chi or more), then fewer edge rows are increased, and the central part of the strip does not receive the benefits of the marginal effect. Conversely, if the strip is narrowed, the distance between the strips also narrows (if wheat and cotton are required to each occupy half of the area), and when this distance shrinks to a certain extent, it will cause mutual shading between the strips, and at this time the marginal effect does not actually exist. In addition, the closer the wheat strips are, the more severely they shade the cotton seedlings, which is a disadvantage of wheat-cotton intercropping. Some places take a one-chi strip width, and even sow cotton in the wheat rows, which not only fails to make full use of the advantages of intercropping to increase wheat yield, but is even more detrimental to the growth of cotton. According to experiments, a wheat strip with a width of three chi is the best, and the cotton strip can be slightly wider (about four and a half chi), so that in addition to the most obvious yield increase effect, it is also more convenient to use mechanical sowing and operation management. When sowing cotton, pay attention that the edge row should not be too close to the wheat strip (no less than five cun), otherwise the edge row of cotton will be in the shadow of the wheat strip, the emergence will be delayed, and the development will be poor.

    2.  Is east-west strip orientation better, or north-south strip orientation?
    In order to reduce the impact of wheat strip shading on cotton seedling development, it is best to take an east-west strip orientation. According to this year's experiment, cotton seedlings with an east-west strip orientation can basically receive sunlight all day long, are not blocked by the wheat rows, and the field temperature is also increased as a result, which is conducive to the growth of cotton seedlings, and their trait performance is significantly better than north-south orientation. For the late growth of wheat and cotton, the sunshine and temperature conditions in the east-west direction are also better than in the north-south direction.

    3.  What density is appropriate?
    In the case of sufficient water and fertilizer, the reason that hinders the further increase in density in general fields is mainly that the problems of light and ventilation cannot be solved. The intercropped field has good light and ventilation conditions, so the density can be appropriately increased. For example, the appropriate seeding rate for general wheat fields in the Fenghuo Commune is 23 to 25 jin, while it can be increased to 30 jin for intercropping; the general number of cotton plants in open fields is about 4,500, while it can be increased to more than 5,000 for intercropping.

    麦棉套作麦棉双收
    中国农业科学院农业气象研究室
    我国各地棉区都存在粮、棉争地的矛盾。大多数地区，凡无霜期在三百天以下的，收了麦直播棉花已不可能；而收了棉花再播麦，也会使小麦减产。怎样能使粮棉双丰收呢？麦棉套作是一个好办法。麦棉套作就是将小麦播成三、四尺宽带状，留出相应的空行，次年在空行内播入三至四行棉花。
    许多经验证明，在水肥条件较好的情况下，套作是能够获得高而稳定的产量的。据陕西乾县烽火人民公社的试验，在与大田一切措施相同的情况下，麦棉套作几年来都获得了丰产：1959年小麦平均亩产五百一十四斤（以实播面积计。下同），比大田增产119％；籽棉五百七十六点六斤，比大田增产36％；1960年五十亩大面积的套作小麦平均亩产八百九十二斤，比大田增产75％。
    为麦棉生长创造了较好的环境
    麦棉套作增产的原因，主要是解决了密植和透光通风的矛盾。套作增加了边行，也就是增加了直接受日射的面积。如以百尺长、三尺宽的播种带计，在麦、棉生长后期受日射面积能比一般麦田增加170％，其中接受太阳直接辐射的面积增加50％左右。同时，种成带状后，株间透射也大大增强。一般大田在麦棉生长后期，株间辐射强度仅只达到自然辐射的1—5％；可是套作的麦、棉带中央（最荫蔽处），株间辐射强度能达到自然辐射的10—20％。尤其是与大田比较起来，套作麦、棉带间早晚透射特别多，而早晚的日射对于光合作用来说是最能被利用的。例如，根据实测结果，棉花在8月初（蕾铃盛期）的株间透射率，套作中央部分早、晚比大田多10—15％，正午比大田多约5％。小麦后期的情况也类似。
    由于接受太阳辐射的面积及透射率的增加，不但促进了作物光合作用，而且提高了田间温度，加之套作的通风情况较好，使得后期田间空气能保持较为干燥。在小麦拔节至成熟和棉花封垅后，套作田间空气相对湿度一般能比大田小10—15％。
    套作与大田小气候的这些差异，改善了作物的生存条件，日射在田间分布均匀，使得光合作用旺盛，因而小麦分蘖多、穗大、粒多、粒重；棉花蕾多、铃大。
    套作的麦棉抗逆力强
    套作的麦、棉，还表现了较强的抗逆力。对于小麦来说，最突出的一点是，套作的小麦不易倒伏。从茎秆性状的调查看来，套作小麦，特别是它的边行，茎粗节短，抗折断力强，表现了明显的抗倒伏的性能。
    套作棉花的最大特点是，它的蕾铃脱落少。麦棉套作，二者生长期有一定的交错时间，在华北地区这段时间约为四、五十天。这一阶段生长在麦带间的棉苗，受麦带遮光，田间的温度也因麦带的影响而比大田稍低。这些不利条件使得棉花苗期发育缓慢，前期现蕾少（但春季大风和寒潮多的地方又不一样，麦带能缓和降温和风速，对棉苗起了保护作用，因此是有利的），但是麦收后，日射和通风情况大大优于大田。7、8月间大田蕾铃一般脱落严重，而套作却脱落较少，并且现蕾多。因此，套作棉花最后还是比大田产量高。
    套作作物生长健壮，有较强的抗病力，同时日射较强，及空气湿度较小，因此对病菌的发展也起了抑制作用。调查表明，套作的小麦锈病发生较少，棉花烂铃较少。
    套作的麦、棉对气候变化能有较大的适应性。例如烽火公社所在的陕西关中地区，去年遭伏旱，今夏却阴雨连绵，但就在这条件截然不同的两年，套作的作物却都表现得很好。究其原因，一方面是套作作物生长较健壮，有较大的抗逆力；另一方面是套作田的水分状况较好——旱年因蒸腾面积小，总耗水量少，土地下层能保持较多水分；涝年因地表温度较高和通风良好关系加速了蒸发，能够保持地面和近地层空气较为干燥。
    总的说来，采用套作的方法，可以较有把握地得到丰产。据某些调查材料证明，套作能使一亩地发挥一亩半，甚至两亩的作用，因此能解决粮棉争地的矛盾。之外，在棉地套种麦子，还可以减少回茬麦，调剂秋收秋种时劳力的紧张。套作的麦、棉由于其抗逆力的增强，又可省去一系列的田间管理工序，如小麦倒伏后的补救措施，棉花的推株并垅、打老叶等；在空行间进行操作管理，也较一般大田方便得多。根据烽火公社这几年的经验，麦棉套作不但不费劳力，反而省劳力。麦棉套作是一种值得推广的耕作制度。
    发挥套作潜力必须注意的问题
    为了更好地发挥麦棉套作的增产潜力，在采用这种方法时还要注意以下几个问题：
    一、麦、棉的带宽度多大算适宜？
    有麦、棉套作习惯的地方不少，各地沿用的带宽不一。根据我们研究，麦、棉带过宽过窄都不能得到最大程度的增产。套作增产作用，主要在于它能增加边行，发挥边际效应。据实测结果，日射从大田边行往中间减弱，小麦约在二尺以后，棉花约在第三行以后，就削弱到与大田中央相近了，植株性状也是在此范围内表现与田中央部分有差异，所以边际效应幅度大约是二至三尺宽。如果套作带太宽（五六尺以上），那么边行增加得少，带中央部分受不到边际效应的好处。相反，要是带放窄了，则带与带间距离也随着窄了（如果要求麦、棉各占一半面积的话），这距离缩小到一定程度就会产生带与带之间的互相遮荫，这时边际效应实际上也不存在了。此外，麦带距离越近，对棉苗的遮荫越厉害，使棉苗前期生长不良，是麦棉套作不利的一方面。有些地方采取一尺的带宽，甚至在麦行中播入棉花，其结果不但不能充分利用套作的优点使小麦增产，对棉花的生长更是不利。根据试验，小麦带以三尺宽度为最好，棉花带可稍宽（四尺五左右），这样除增产效果最明显外，使用机播和操作管理也较方便。播种棉花时还要注意其边行与麦带距离不能过近（不少于五寸），否则边行棉花处在麦带阴影中，出苗延迟，发育不良。
    二、带向是东西好呢，还是南北好？
    为减轻麦带遮荫对棉苗发育的影响，最好采取东西带向。据今年试验，东西带向的棉苗基本上能全日接受日照，不被麦行遮挡，田间温度也因而有所提高，这都利于棉苗的生长，其性状表现显著优于南北向。对于小麦及棉花后期的生育说来，东西向的日照和温度条件也比南北向要好。
    三、密度怎样才算适宜？
    在水肥较足的情况下，阻碍一般大田进一步提高密度的原因主要是透光通风问题不能解决。套作的田间有很好的透光通风条件，所以密度可适当增大。例如烽火公社一般大田小麦适宜播量是二十三到二十五斤，套作的可增至三十斤；棉花一般大田约四千五百株，套作可增至五千株以上。
