Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 21st: On the afternoon of October 20th, as people from all walks of life in Japan held their 23rd National Unified Action, the Japanese Peace Committee Delegation and the Japan-Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee Delegation, who are currently visiting China, held a gathering on a Yangtze River ship en route from Wuhan to Nanjing. They angrily protested against the murder of Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, by the US-Japan reactionaries and firmly demanded the abolition of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty."

Kenshiro Yanagida, head of the Japanese Peace Committee Delegation, and Tokumatsu Sakamoto, head of the Japan-Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee Delegation, as well as all members of both delegations, spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they expressed great indignation at the atrocities of the US-Japan reactionaries and mourned the death of Inejiro Asanuma. They unanimously pointed out that the murder of Inejiro Asanuma meant the resurgence of fascism in Japan. They expressed their determination to fight against the US-Japan reactionaries.

A resolution was passed at the meeting. The resolution stated that the Japanese Peace Committee Delegation and the Japan-Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee Delegation, in order to protest the murder of Socialist Party Chairman Asanuma and to respond to the 23rd unified action held throughout Japan, held a joint meeting on October 20th on the Yangtze River from Wuhan to Nanjing. The conclusion reached at the meeting was that the murder of Chairman Asanuma was carried out by US imperialism and the reactionary ruling forces of Japan. They were afraid of the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people displayed in the twenty-two opposition movements against the US-Japan "Security Treaty." The murder of Mr. Asanuma was a despicable conspiracy to strike at the Socialist Party and democratic forces, undermine the democratic united front, and prevent the inevitable intensification of opposition to the US-Japan "Security Treaty" in the general election. At the same time, this also means the resurgence of fascism in Japan. The two delegations confirmed that only by striving to strengthen the democratic united front and smashing the fascist conspiracy of the US-Japan reactionary forces can the death of Mr. Asanuma not be a futile sacrifice. The two delegations are determined to learn from the great experience of China's brilliant victories in socialist construction and fight with renewed determination. We resolve: to demand the immediate resignation of the Ikeda Cabinet and the dismissal of Kashimura, the Director-General of the National Police Agency, Ogura, the Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police Department, and other security officials; to severely punish the criminals and those related to them, and to disband all right-wing violent groups; to fight for the abolition of the US-Japan Security Treaty, the withdrawal of US military bases, and the return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands; to support China's liberation of Taiwan, to demand the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and South Vietnam, and the withdrawal of US troops from the entire Asian region; to fight for complete disarmament and the denuclearization of Asia and the Pacific region; to consolidate the solidarity between the people of Japan and China and strengthen the struggle against the common enemy, US imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 21st: The Japanese Peace Committee Delegation led by Kenshiro Yanagida and the Japan-Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee Delegation led by Tokumatsu Sakamoto came to Nanjing from Wuhan this morning for a visit and left Nanjing for Shanghai in the afternoon. Guo Yingqiu, Chairman of the Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City Branches of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, hosted a luncheon today to entertain all members of the delegation. The guests visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing, paid tribute to the revolutionary martyrs' cemetery in Yuhuatai, toured Xuanwu Lake, and visited the Nanjing Radio Industry School.

    在我国访问的日本两个和平代表团集会
    抗议美日反动派杀害浅沼
    新华社南京21日电　20日下午，当日本各界人民举行第二十三次全国统一行动的时候，正在我国访问的日本和平委员会代表团和日本亚非团结委员会代表团在由武汉赴南京途中的长江江轮上举行集会，愤怒抗议美日反动派杀害日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎，坚决要求废除新日美“安全条约”。
    日本和平委员会代表团团长柳田谦十郎和日本亚非团结委员会代表团团长坂本德松，以及两代表团全体团员，都在会上讲了话。他们在讲话中对美日反动派的暴行表示非常愤慨，对浅沼稻次郎的逝世表示哀悼。并且一致指出，浅沼稻次郎被杀害事件，意味着法西斯主义在日本的重新抬头。他们在会上表示了对美日反动派斗争的决心。
    会上通过了一项决议。决议说，日本和平委员会代表团和日本亚非团结委员会代表团，为了对杀害社会党浅沼委员长事件表示抗议，并响应在日本全国举行的第二十三次统一行动，于10月20日在从武汉到南京的长江上举行了联合集会。会上获得的结论认为，杀害浅沼委员长的是美帝国主义和日本的反动统治势力，他们对数达二十二次的反对日美“安全保障”条约运动中所显示的日本人民的爱国正义斗争感到害怕，杀害浅沼先生是企图打击社会党和民主力量，破坏民主统一战线，阻止势所必至的在大选中反对日美“安全保障”条约更加激烈化的一个卑鄙的阴谋。同时，这还意味着法西斯主义在日本的重新抬头。两代表团确认，只有努力加强民主统一战线，粉碎美日反动势力的法西斯阴谋，才是不使浅沼先生之死成为无谓牺牲的道路。两代表团决心学习在社会主义建设中取得光辉胜利的中国的伟大的经验，以新的决心进行奋斗。我们决议：要求池田内阁立即辞职，并罢免警察厅长官柏村、警视总监小仓等治安方面的负责人；严惩罪犯以及与罪犯有关的人，解散一切右翼暴力团体；为废除日美安全保障条约、撤销美国军事基地、归还冲绳和小笠原岛而奋斗；支持中国解放台湾，要求从南朝鲜、南越南撤退美国军队，从整个亚洲地区撤退美国军队；为全面裁军和亚洲及太平洋区域的非核武装化而奋斗；巩固日中两国人民的团结，加强对共同的敌人美帝国主义的斗争。
    新华社南京21日电　以柳田谦十郎为首的日本和平委员会代表团和以坂本德松为首的日本亚非团结委员会代表团，今天上午自武汉来南京参观访问，下午离南京去上海。　　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会江苏省和南京市分会主席郭影秋，今天中午设便宴招待代表团全体成员。　　客人们在南京晋谒了中山陵，凭吊了雨花台革命烈士墓，游览了玄武湖，参观了南京无线电工业学校。
