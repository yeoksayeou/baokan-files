    The Greatest Saving
    Yu Dong
    The Yongle Commune's Lianmeng Production Team has implemented a method of "one person, multiple skills" and comprehensive use of labor, mobilizing everyone to tap into their labor potential and eliminate wasted manpower, saving all possible labor to strengthen the agricultural production front line. This is a very good experience. The situations in each commune and production team are not exactly the same, but if everyone learns from the Lianmeng Production Team's methods, they can all save a significant amount of labor and strengthen the agricultural production front. This can be affirmed.
    Why is the Lianmeng Production Team able to save labor so effectively? Mainly because they fully recognize that saving labor is the central link in carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and it is the central link in striving for a large-scale agricultural and grain production movement. They made up their minds and tried every means to solve this problem. If this problem is solved, other problems will be easier to handle.
    When it comes to saving, people often think of material aspects first, paying attention to saving materialized labor, because waste in this area is the easiest to see. However, saving labor is sometimes easily overlooked, because waste in this area requires more observation and in-depth investigation to understand the details.
    The working people of our country have always paid attention to saving labor. When talking about saving, the words "diligence and thrift" are always mentioned together, and the word "diligence" is placed first. "Diligence" means making full use of labor time, striving to improve labor efficiency, and saving live labor; "thrift" means most effectively reducing material consumption and saving materialized labor. Savings in material aspects have a certain limit, while savings in labor, or rather, the greater exertion of labor capacity, have unlimited potential. People can continuously improve labor organization, innovate production tools, and improve operating techniques with the development and changes in production, tapping labor potential from all aspects and improving labor productivity.
    Where should labor potential be tapped? The laborers know best. When solving this problem, leaders must mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. It is necessary to carry out in-depth political and ideological work among the masses, as well as meticulous organizational work, so that everyone can come up with ideas and methods to skillfully arrange labor, ensuring that everyone has appropriate work to do and everything is properly managed, tapping all aspects of potential, plugging all loopholes, and saving labor to the greatest extent.

    最大的节约
    豫东
    永乐公社联盟生产队实行一人多能、综合使用劳力的办法，发动人人大挖劳动潜力，消除窝工浪费现象，把一切可以节省的劳动力节省下来，加强农业生产第一线。这是一个很好的经验。各个公社、各个生产队的情况不尽相同，但是，如果大家都学习联盟生产队的办法，都能节约大量劳动力，加强农业生产战线，这是可以肯定的。
    为什么联盟生产队能够这样有效地节约劳动力？主要是因为他们充分认识到了劳动力的节约是开展增产节约运动的中心环节，是争取大办农业、大办粮食运动的中心环节。他们下了狠心，千方百计来解决这个问题。这个问题解决了，其他问题就好办了。
    谈到节约，人们往往首先想到物质方面，即注意物化劳动的节约，因为这方面的浪费是最容易看见的。对劳动力的节约，有时却容易被忽视，因为这方面的浪费需要多看一看，需要作些深入的调查，才能明了底细。
    我国的劳动人民从来是很注意劳动力的节约的。谈到节约，总是“勤俭”二字并提，并且把“勤”字放在前面。“勤”就是充分利用劳动时间，努力提高劳动工效，节约活劳动；“俭”就是最有效的减少物质方面的消耗，节约物化劳动。物质方面的节约是有一定限度的，而劳动力方面的节约，或者说劳动能力的更大发挥，则是潜力无穷的。人们可以随着生产的发展和变化，不断地改进劳动组织，革新生产工具，提高操作技术，从各方面挖掘劳动潜力，提高劳动生产率。
    应该从哪里挖掘劳动潜力？劳动者是最清楚的。在解决这个问题的时候，领导者一定要把群众的积极性发动起来。既要在群众中进行深入的政治思想工作，又要进行细致的组织工作，让大家都来出主意，想办法，巧妙地安排劳力，作到人人都有适当的事作，事事都有适当的人管，把各方面的潜力挖掘出来，把各种漏洞堵塞起来，作到最大限度地节约劳动力。
