Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: On the eve of "October 25th," former cadres and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have written letters to their comrades-in-arms in the Korean People's Army to express their friendship. In their letters, they expressed their longing for the Korean people, praised the achievements of the Korean people on the construction front as they ride the "Chollima," and warmly supported the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their country.

Many former cadres and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have, in the years since their return home, never forgotten the Korean people and the Korean People's Army comrades-in-arms with whom they fought side by side. The letters they wrote to their Korean comrades vividly express the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. Some recalled the battles they fought together with their Korean comrades, the mountains they climbed together, and the rivers they crossed together. Others recalled how they supported each other on the battlefield; how they gave each other their coats and quilts on snowy nights to shield their comrades from the cold; and how they shared meals cooked in a single pot in the forests, on the riverbanks, or in the valleys. Ai Dianwu, the company commander of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front and former platoon leader of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, once defended Kaesong alongside the People's Army. He wrote to his Korean People's Army comrades-in-arms now stationed in the Kaesong area, saying, "Since returning to China from Korea, I have been thinking of you all the time. I pay attention to the good news about Korean construction in the newspapers every day, and every achievement you make fills me with joy. Now, I am on duty on our country's coast defense line, and you are standing on the eastern forefront of the socialist camp. We are still shoulder to shoulder defending Asian and world peace."

The heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who participated in the Battle of Triangle Hill (Shangganling) collectively wrote a letter to their comrades-in-arms in the Korean People's Army. Among those who signed the letter were Zhao Maochen, the former political instructor of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who was awarded the special-class merit for his role in the Battle of Triangle Hill, Li Baocheng, the former company commander of the "Steel Eighth Company" of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who held the tunnel at Triangle Hill for fourteen days and nights, and Zhang Tuanyun, the former platoon leader of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who led the assault platoon and captured four positions in a row when seizing the main peak of Hill 597.9 at Triangle Hill. Their letter recounted the unbreakable friendship they formed with the Korean People's Army in the flames of war, as well as the profound feelings of sharing weal and woe with the Korean people during the days of arduous struggle. They said that they would always remember the Korean mothers who gave up their warm *ondols* (heated floors) to warm the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers on those snowy nights; they would always remember the Korean sisters who used their heads to hold up stones and earth to repair roads to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's victorious operations under enemy bombing; and they would always remember the Korean fathers and brothers who, regardless of their lives, broke through the enemy's artillery blockade to transport ammunition for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army during times of intense combat. They said that the people of our two countries shed blood together and sweat together, which is a concentrated expression of the internationalist spirit of the two peoples. They said that the Korean people will surely be able to build their motherland more beautifully and prosperously in the Chollima Movement; and they will surely achieve victory in the just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their country.

Many former cadres and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army warmly congratulated their comrades-in-arms in the Korean People's Army on their new achievements in strengthening their national defense and expressed their determination to learn from the Korean People's Army comrades' heroic and tenacious fighting style and their spirit of hard work.

Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea ("October 25th"), former Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers have written articles recalling the great friendship established between the Chinese and Korean peoples in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression, expressing that they will continue to contribute to consolidating and developing this great friendship in the future.

An article collectively written by Huang Jiguang's former comrades-in-arms, entitled "Long Live the Fighting Friendship of the Chinese and Korean Peoples," said: In the days of the war against U.S. imperialism's aggression, we forged a fighting friendship with the Korean people with our blood. This friendship is like the evergreen pine on Mount Paektu, forever green, like the waters of the Yalu River, eternally flowing. We will never forget. The article said: During the Battle of Triangle Hill, we saw with our own eyes that men and women, old and young, throughout the Triangle Hill area were mobilized. They organized tea stations, casualty transfer stations, material support stations, stretcher teams, and other activities on the front lines. When we were unable to get water for several days while holding the tunnels, they sent us radishes and fruit. Bai Jinglong, the leader of the Public Cave Village self-defense force, took out his savings, ran one hundred and eighty *li* overnight, and bought three hundred *jin* of apples for us to eat. When we were short of vegetables, the elderly and women braved the enemy's artillery fire to dig wild vegetables for us to eat. When the young woman Shi Jirong was digging wild vegetables, her left leg was broken by an enemy shell. When we went to visit her, she said: "For the motherland, to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, to fight the American bandits, it is worth it even if my leg is broken." The internationalist fighter Park Jae-geun encountered enemy aircraft bombing while rescuing wounded Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers. In order to protect the lives of the wounded Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers, he covered the wounded with his own body, and a shrapnel hit him. When he woke up in the hospital, the first thing he asked was: "Have the wounded Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers been brought in?" He gloriously sacrificed himself as soon as he finished speaking. The article said that the heroic image of the Korean people is forever etched in our hearts, and the friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples is thus forged with blood.

Guo Enzhi, a former first-class hero and special-class meritorious official of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, said in an article commemorating "October 25th": In the great anti-American struggle, the lofty qualities of high patriotism and internationalism and the heroic and tenacious fighting spirit demonstrated by our close comrades-in-arms, the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, have always been a model for us to learn from. We will never forget the heroic battle of the People's Army comrades who defended Hill 1211. At that time, the U.S. invading army successively launched fierce attacks on Hill 1211 and its surrounding heights with the strength of two divisions. The officers and soldiers of the People's Army carried out a heroic and tenacious resistance. The 19-year-old squad leader Li Shoufu, in the emergency situation where the counterattack force was blocked by an enemy firing point and could not move forward, stepped forward and used his own body to block the enemy's firing point, opening up a path for his comrades to victoriously annihilate the enemy. In this battle, which lasted for more than two months, the comrades of the People's Army eliminated more than 15,900 enemies, and the position stood firm, creating a brilliant example of tenacious defense. The invaders had to admit defeat and call Hill 1211 "Heartbreak Ridge." The heroic and tenacious fighting spirit of the People's Army and the glorious image of heroes such as Li Shoufu not only gave great encouragement to the broad masses of officers and soldiers of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army but will always be a force to inspire us to move forward. In many articles, former Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel unanimously stated that they will always cherish the fighting friendship forged with blood between the Chinese and Korean peoples as they cherish the pupils of their eyes.

    并肩打击共同敌人　决心增进伟大友谊
    前志愿军指战员写信写文章表述对朝鲜人民的怀念
    据新华社23日讯　“十·二五”前夕，前中国人民志愿军的干部、战士纷纷写信给朝鲜人民军战友畅叙友情。他们在书信中表述了对朝鲜人民的怀念，盛赞朝鲜人民在建设战线上跨上“千里马”所取得的成就，热烈支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的斗争。
    前志愿军的许多干部、战士，归国几年来，念念不忘朝鲜的人民和并肩作战过的朝鲜人民军战友。他们给朝鲜战友写的信中，集中地表达了中朝人民的深厚友情。有些人回忆起与朝鲜战友一起打过的仗，一起爬过的山，一起涉过的河。还有人回忆起与朝鲜人民军战友怎样在战场上互相支援；怎样在大雪纷飞的夜里，互相让出自己的大衣和棉被，为战友遮避风寒；怎样在森林中、河滩上或山谷里，共吃一个锅煮的饭。福建前线中国人民解放军某部连长、前志愿军排长艾殿武，曾经与人民军并肩保卫过开城，他写信给现在驻守在开城地区的朝鲜人民军战友说：“我从朝鲜回国后，无时无刻不在想念着你们。我每天注意报纸上有关朝鲜建设的好消息，你们的每一项建设成就都使我感到欢欣鼓舞。现在，我在我国海防线上执勤，你们站在社会主义阵营的东方最前哨，我们仍然是肩并肩地保卫着亚洲和世界和平。”
    当年参加上甘岭战斗的志愿军英雄们，集体给朝鲜人民军战友写了信。在信上签名的，有在上甘岭战役中荣立特等功臣的前志愿军某部指导员赵毛臣，有在上甘岭坑道里坚守十四昼夜的“钢铁八连”的前志愿军某连连长李保成，有在夺取上甘岭五九七点九高地主峰时，带领突击排连续夺下四座阵地的前志愿军某部排长张团云。他们的信上，叙述了在战火中与朝鲜人民军结成的牢不可破的友谊，还叙述了在艰苦斗争日子里与朝鲜人民同患难、共甘苦的深厚情意。他们说，他们永远记得在那些风雪怒吼的夜晚，朝鲜母亲们让出热炕，给志愿军战士取暖的情谊；永远记得在敌机轰炸之下，朝鲜姐妹用头顶着石块和泥土，为支援志愿军胜利作战而修补公路的场面；永远记得在战斗非常紧张的时刻，朝鲜父老兄弟不顾生命危险，突破敌人炮火封锁，为志愿军运送弹药的情形。他们说，我们两国人民，血流在一起，汗流在一起，这是两国人民国际主义精神的集中表现。他们说，朝鲜人民在千里马运动中一定能把祖国建设得更美丽和富强；在和平统一祖国的正义斗争中一定能取得胜利。
    前志愿军的许多干部、战士，在信中热烈祝贺朝鲜人民军战友在加强国防力量中取得的新成就，并且表示，努力学习朝鲜人民军战友们的英勇顽强的战斗作风以及艰苦奋斗的精神。
    据新华社23日讯　“十·二五”中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战十周年前夕，前中国人民志愿军指战员纷纷写文章回忆中朝人民在反对美帝国主义侵略的共同斗争中建立起来的伟大友谊，表示今后将继续为巩固和发展这种伟大友谊贡献力量。
    黄继光生前战友们集体写的一篇“中朝人民的战斗友谊万岁”的文章中说：在反对美帝国主义侵略战争的日子里，我们与朝鲜人民用鲜血结下了战斗友谊。这种友谊像长白山上的苍松，永远常青，像鸭绿江的江水，永流不断。我们永远不会忘记。文章说：在上甘岭战役，我们亲眼看到，整个上甘岭地区的朝鲜男女老少都动员起来了。他们组织茶水站、伤员转送站、物资支援站、担架队等活跃在火线上。当我们坚守坑道几天喝不上水的时候，他们就送来了萝卜、水果。公洞里自卫队长白景龙把自己积存的钱拿出来，连夜跑了一百八十里，买了三百斤苹果给我们吃。我们缺少蔬菜，老人、妇女冒着敌人炮火挖野菜给我们吃。石吉荣姑娘挖野菜时左腿被敌人炮弹打断了，我们去慰问她，她说：“为了祖国，为了支援志愿军，打美国强盗，腿断了也值得。”国际主义战士朴在根在抢救志愿军伤员时，突然遇到敌人飞机的轰炸，他为了保护志愿军伤员的生命，用自己的肉体掩盖伤员，一块弹片打到他身上。当他被送到医院苏醒过来时，第一句就问：“志愿军伤员抬来了没有？”这句话刚说完他就光荣地牺牲了。文章说，朝鲜人民的英雄形象永远记在我们心里，中朝人民的友谊就是这样用鲜血凝成的。
    前志愿军一级英雄、特等功臣郭恩志在纪念“十·二五”的文章中说：在伟大的反美斗争中，我们亲密战友——朝鲜人民军官兵所表现出来的高度爱国主义、国际主义的崇高品质和英勇顽强的战斗精神，一直是我们学习的榜样。我们永远不会忘记人民军同志坚守一二一一高地的英勇战斗。当时，美国侵略军先后以两个多师的兵力向一二一一高地及其附近的高地连续发动猛攻，人民军指战员进行了英勇卓绝的顽强抗击。十九岁的分队长李寿福在反击部队被敌人一个火力点阻住无法前进的紧急情况下，挺身而出，用自己的身体堵住敌人的火力点，为战友们开辟了胜利歼敌的道路。人民军同志在这次持续两个多月的战斗中，消灭敌人一万五千九百多名，阵地屹立未动，创造了坚守防御的光辉战例。侵略者不得不垂头丧气地把一二一一高地称为“伤心岭”。人民军英勇顽强的战斗精神和李寿福等英雄的光辉形象，不仅曾经给了我们志愿军广大指战员以极大鼓舞，而且永远是激励我们前进的力量。在许多文章中，前志愿军人员一致表示今后将永远像爱护眼珠一样地爱护中朝人民用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊。
