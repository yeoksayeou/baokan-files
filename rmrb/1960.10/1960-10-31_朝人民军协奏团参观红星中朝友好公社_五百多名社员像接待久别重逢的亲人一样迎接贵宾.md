More than 500 commune members lined up along the shaded path of the commune from early morning to welcome the distinguished Korean guests from the heroic land. As Major General Zhang Ruihuan and others stepped out of the car, the sounds of gongs, drums, firecrackers, and applause resounded. The commune leaders and the commune members welcoming the guests on both sides of the road greeted the honored guests like long-lost relatives.

Guo Fang, secretary of the Red Star China-Korea Friendship People's Commune Party Committee, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of all commune members. He said that they were extremely happy that the relatives from the Korean People's Army Ensemble had come to their commune. When he talked about the close friendship between the Red Star China-Korea Friendship People's Commune and the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Sunan County, South Pyongan Province, Korea, he said that the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative had sent them valuable high-quality rice seeds, which had already borne the fruits of friendship today.

Guo Fang said that they were particularly excited about the great achievements made by the heroic Korean people in agriculture at the speed of Chollima under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, because they always regarded the achievements of the Korean people as if they were their own achievements, and they were overjoyed by them. He said that the people of China and Korea are brotherly neighbors who are as closely related as lips and teeth. In the struggle against common enemies, the friendship between the people of our two countries, cemented with blood, is evergreen and unbreakable.

Major General Zhang Ruihuan expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome from the Red Star China-Korea Friendship People's Commune. He said that our two countries are close comrades-in-arms who share life and death in the struggle against common enemies. Today, we are taking advantage of the opportunity to visit the Red Star China-Korea Friendship People's Commune to convey the friendship and congratulations of the Korean people.

Major General Zhang Ruihuan said that after this visit, we have a deeper understanding of the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, holding high the three red banners. He said that from the achievements made by the Red Star China-Korea Friendship People's Commune, one can also see the achievements of all people's communes in China. The Chinese people can only achieve such achievements under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong.

The honored guests, accompanied by the hosts, visited the commune's agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing plant, dairy farm, threshing ground, etc. The Korean People's Army Ensemble and the Red Star China-Korea Friendship People's Commune exchanged gifts.

When the honored guests were leaving the Red Star China-Korea Friendship People's Commune, Guo Fang, secretary of the commune party committee, entrusted the honored guests with a bundle of rice ears, the fruit of friendship grown from the rice seeds donated by the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Korea, to the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative, and asked them to convey their gratitude and greetings to the members of the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative.

    今天，风和日暖，秋色宜人，红星中朝友好人民公社一片喜气洋洋，五百多名社员从清晨就列队在公社的林荫道旁，迎接来自英雄国土上的朝鲜贵宾。当张瑞焕少将等步下汽车时，锣鼓声、鞭炮声和掌声响成一片。公社负责人和夹道欢迎的社员们，像接待久别重逢的亲人一样，迎接贵宾。

    郭方说，英勇的朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，以千里马的速度在农业上获得的伟大成就，使我们感到格外兴奋，因为我们总是把朝鲜人民的成就看作如同我们自己取得的成就一样，我们为它欢欣鼓舞。他说，中朝两国人民是唇齿相依、休戚与共的兄弟邻邦，在反对共同敌人的斗争中，我们两国人民之间以鲜血凝成的友谊，是万古长青、牢不可破的。
