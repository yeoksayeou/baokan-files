Gai Ping Improves Leadership Methods and Strengthens Grassroots Work
Timely Discovery and Proper Resolution of Key Problems in Production, While Promoting the Business Work of Various Departments

    This newspaper reports that Gai Ping County, Liaoning Province, is universally implementing the leadership method of "secretaries overseeing areas, departments overseeing communes, fixed assignments year-round, responsibility to the end," effectively strengthening concrete leadership over agricultural production. In the struggle for autumn field management, production self-salvation, and elimination of weeds and insect pests, county, commune, brigade, and team cadres converged in the fields, working hard alongside the broad masses of commune members, completing three rounds of weeding and fertilizer application for crops in one fell swoop, and basically eliminating weeds and insect pests.

    The leadership method implemented in Gai Ping County can be summarized as follows: the entire county's thirteen people's communes are divided into four areas. The five county committee secretaries, except for the secretary in charge of industry, each oversee one area, with three to four communes in each area. Points are established within each area to drive the overall situation. Each department and commission of the county committee and each section and bureau of the county people's committee, in groups of two or three departments, oversee one commune. The county committee designates a leader and deputy leader to lead the cadres of their respective departments to settle in the commune and brigade, with fixed assignments year-round, responsibility to the end. The task of the departments overseeing the commune is, on the one hand, to organize and mobilize the cadres of their own departments to participate in production, eating, living, working, and discussing matters with the commune members. On the other hand, they must participate in the commune party committee's leadership over production, acting as advisors to the commune and brigade. At the same time, they must also serve as assistants to the county committee, promptly reporting situations, publicizing and implementing the Party's policies to the people, closely centering around the Party's central work in each period, and doing a good job in their respective department's business. In order to strengthen the leadership over the cadres sent to the countryside by various departments, the county committee stipulated: First, a meeting of the leaders of the commune work groups is held every half-month to report on the situation and problems below. At the same time, one to one and a half days are set aside to study the Party's policies and study the instructions of the higher-level Party committee on the current work. During this period, the county committee also holds meetings (or expanded meetings) to study and resolve measures based on the problems existing in the actual work below and to deploy the next stage of work. Second, the work group leader conveys the arrangements of the Party committee to the commune Party committee and assists the commune Party committee in implementing them. The work group leader participates in the commune Party committee meeting and conducts work under the unified leadership of the commune Party committee. Third, all cadres sent to the countryside participate in the study organization of the commune or brigade's theory and policies, combining study with research on practical work problems. Fourth, the county committee regularly checks the work of each department overseeing the commune, and the quality of production in the communes they oversee is used as one of the criteria for measuring the work of each department.

    After Gai Ping County implemented this leadership method, it effectively strengthened leadership on the front line of production and promptly resolved many key problems in production. Wei Min, the first secretary of the county committee, worked with the commune members in the Tangchi production team of the Xiong Yue Commune, which he was responsible for overseeing, and discovered that there was a shortage of rural labor, and that the spring plowing and summer hoeing tasks could not be completed in time. He used the method of dissecting a sparrow, on the one hand, helping to rationally adjust the labor organization, and on the other hand, helping the production team to reform more than ten kinds of spring planting and summer hoeing tools, promoting production. Then, he held an on-site meeting on tool reform here and vigorously promoted it throughout the county, so that more than 65% of the land in the county was semi-mechanized during the spring plowing and summer hoeing period. Zhang Qi, secretary of the county committee, discovered in May that some commune members in the area he was responsible for had the idea of ​​neglecting full seedlings. He promptly reported to the county committee and issued the call to "fully check, fully replant, not lose a seedling, and not miss an acre" throughout the county, so that more than 180,000 mu of land with missing seedlings in the county basically achieved full seedlings.

    After Gai Ping County implemented the "department overseeing commune" system, it ensured that the majority of cadres went deep into the grassroots and concentrated their efforts on doing a good job in the Party's central work. In the past, when the county committee organized cadres to go to the countryside, some departments always emphasized that their work was busy, and regarded doing central work as an extra burden; even if some cadres went down, their work was not very thorough. Now, this situation has completely changed, and the atmosphere of going deep into production, leading production, and sharing the fate of the masses has gradually formed among all cadres. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 3,000 cadres active on the front line of production (including some personnel participating in land reclamation), and in half a year, they have done more than 180,000 workdays, an increase of more than five times compared with the same period last year.

    After implementing the "department overseeing commune" system, not only was the central work strengthened, but the business of the departments was also promoted. Because the county committee made unified arrangements for the work of various departments when arranging and deploying work, the central work and the departments were organically combined, giving strong support to the work of the departments; at the same time, the cadres of various departments who went to the countryside, in addition to doing the central work well, also combined it with carrying out the business of the departments, implementing the method of "grasping everything when going to the countryside, and focusing on other things with the central work as the lead," so as to ensure that the central work and the work of the departments are not neglected. For example, the cadres of the county committee's finance and trade department and the county bank, in the Yangyun Commune, which they were responsible for overseeing, on the one hand, led agricultural production, and on the other hand, helped the commune arrange the work of purchasing miscellaneous fruits during the slack season. According to the needs of agricultural work and fruit picking work at that time, they comprehensively adjusted the labor organization and labor remuneration. As a result, the commune did not delay the fruit harvest during the busy farming season, and sold more than 120,000 jin of miscellaneous fruits to the state, exceeding the purchase plan. Their approach was widely promoted throughout the county, so that the county's total purchase of miscellaneous fruits reached more than 1.15 million jin, an increase of ten times compared with 1959. The organization department of the county committee summarized the experience of the Party branch of the Yangshi production team of Lutun Commune in organizing the "learn, compare, catch up, and help" one-stop competition. With the approval of the county committee, a county-wide rural Party branch work meeting was held locally to set an example, spread experience, and drive more than 300 rural branches throughout the county to launch various forms of competitions such as opponent competitions and counterpart competitions, making the work of the county's branches take on a completely new look.

    盖平改进领导方法加强基层工作
    及时发现和妥善解决生产中的关键问题，同时推动了各部门的业务工作
    本报讯　辽宁省盖平县普遍推行“书记包片，部门包社，常年固定，一包到底”的领导工作方法，切实加强了对农业生产的具体领导。在秋田管理、生产自救和消灭草荒虫害斗争中，县、社、队、小队四级干部会师田间，和广大社员一起大干苦干，一举完成了作物三遍铲趟和追肥任务，基本上消灭了草荒虫害。
    盖平县推行的这种领导方法，概括来说，就是把全县十三个人民公社划成四个片，县委五名书记除分管工业的书记以外，其余四名书记各包一片，每片三至四个公社，片中设点，以点带面；县委各部、委和县人委各科、局，每两、三个部门合包一个公社，由县委指定组长和副组长，带领本部门干部到社、队落户，常年固定，一包到底。包社各部门的任务，一方面要组织和动员本部门的干部参加生产，和社员同吃，同住，同劳动，同商量，另方面又要参与公社党委对生产的领导，当好社、队参谋。同时，还要做好县委助手，及时反映情况，向人民群众宣传和贯彻党的方针政策，紧紧围绕各个时期党的中心工作，搞好本部门业务。为了加强对各部门下乡干部的领导，县委规定：一、每半月召开一次包社工作组组长会议，汇报下边情况和问题，同时，抽出一天到一天半的时间，学习党的方针政策和研究上级党委对当前工作的各项指示。在这期间，县委也召开会议（或扩大会议），根据下边实际工作中存在的问题，研究解决措施，布置下段工作。二、工作组组长根据党委的布置，回去向公社党委传达，协助公社党委贯彻执行。工作组组长参加所包公社党委会议，在公社党委统一领导下进行工作。三、所有下乡干部，都参加公社或大队理论和政策的学习组织，结合学习研究实际工作中的问题。四、县委定期检查各包社部门的工作情况，把所包公社的生产好坏，做为衡量各部门工作的标准之一。
    盖平县推行这一领导方法后，切实加强了生产第一线的领导，及时地解决了生产中的许多关键问题。县委第一书记魏民，在重点包干的熊岳公社汤池生产队里，和社员一起劳动，发现农村劳动力不足，春耕、夏锄活计忙不过来，他就用解剖麻雀的办法，一方面帮助合理调整了劳动组织，另方面，帮助生产队改革了十多种春播和夏锄工具，促进了生产。接着，他又在这里召开了工具改革现场会议，向全县大力推广，使全县在春耕和夏锄期间，有65％以上的土地都实现了半机械化。县委书记张旗，5月间在所负责的片内发现有些社员有忽视全苗的思想，便及时向县委汇报，在全县发出“全查、全补，一苗不丢，一亩不漏”的号召，使全县十八万多亩缺苗地，基本上达到了全苗。
    盖平县实行“部门包社”以后，保证了大多数干部深入基层，集中力量搞好党的中心工作。过去，县委组织干部下乡，有些部门总是强调业务忙，把做中心工作看成是额外负担；有些干部即使下去了，工作也不大深入。现在，这种情况完全改变了，深入生产，领导生产，和群众同呼吸共命运的风气，已经在全体干部中逐渐形成。据不完全统计，目前活跃在生产最前线的干部，就有三千多人（包括部分参加开荒人员在内），半年时间内，共做劳动日十八万多个，比去年同时期增加五倍多。
    实行“部门包社”以后，不仅加强了中心工作，也推动了部门的业务。因为县委安排部署工作时，将各部门工作也统一做了安排，使中心与部门有机地结合起来，给部门工作以大力支持；同时，各部门下乡干部除了做好中心工作以外，还结合着开展部门的业务，实行“下乡一把抓，中心带其它”的办法，做到中心与部门工作两不误。如县委财贸部和县银行的干部，在他们包干的杨运公社，一面领导农业生产，一面还帮助公社安排了伏杂果收购工作。他们根据当时农活和采果工作的需要，通盘调整了劳动组织和劳动报酬，结果这个公社农忙未误收果，共卖给国家伏杂果十二万多斤，超额完成了收购计划。他们的这一做法，在全县广泛推广后，使全县伏杂果收购量达到了一百一十五万多斤，比1959年增长十倍。县委组织部在芦屯公社杨氏生产队，总结了这个队党支部组织“学、比、赶、帮”一条龙大竞赛的经验，经县委同意，又在当地召开了全县农村党支部的工作会议，树立榜样传播经验，带动全县三百多个农村支部展开了对手赛、对口赛等多种形式的大竞赛，使得全县支部工作面貌焕然一新。
