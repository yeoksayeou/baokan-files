Xinhua News Agency, 7th. To celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the "Six Hundred Years of German Prints Exhibition," co-organized by the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Sino-German Democratic Republic Friendship Association, and the Chinese Artists Association, and the "Modern Prints Exhibition of the German Democratic Republic," co-organized by the Ministry of Culture and the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, opened this morning at the Waterside Pavilion in Zhongshan Park.

    The opening ceremony was presided over by Qu Wu, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. Luo Guibo, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture, and Wang Daire, Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, attended the opening ceremony.

    Cai Ruohong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association, spoke at the opening ceremony. First, on behalf of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Sino-German Democratic Republic Friendship Association, and the Chinese Artists Association, he wished the exhibition a success.

    He said that German print art not only has a long history and rich heritage but also has brilliant achievements, holding an important position in German and world art history.

    Cai Ruohong said that the name of Käthe Kollwitz, the great revolutionary realist printmaker of 20th-century Germany, is very dear to Chinese artists. Mr. Lu Xun published a special collection introducing her works in 1936. Her militant artworks have always been loved by the Chinese people and have greatly influenced Chinese revolutionary art.

    Cai Ruohong concluded by saying: The German Democratic Republic has been founded for eleven years. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the hardworking and courageous people of the German Democratic Republic have achieved brilliant successes in the great socialist construction. We extend our warm congratulations here.

    In his speech, Bri, First Secretary of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic, talked about the people's and revolutionary traditions of German print art. He then said that the German Democratic Republic not only protects the heritage of great artists, but also, with the development of socialism, socialist art is flourishing and growing. In contrast, the Bonn regime attempts to separate art from the people, antagonize all progress, and promote imperialist war. The German Democratic Republic has become the home of progressive and socialist art for the whole of Germany.

    The "Six Hundred Years of German Prints Exhibition," on display today at the Waterside Pavilion in Zhongshan Park, includes more than 200 exquisite works from various historical periods of Germany from the 15th to the early 20th century, many of which are valuable original prints by world-renowned artists. There are copperplate prints by the famous printmaker Dürer reflecting the German Peasants' War, as well as copperplate, lithograph, and etching prints by Klinger and others depicting the era of the bourgeois democratic revolution. The "Workers' Uprising Series" (i.e., "Workers' Rebellion"), which Lu Xun made high evaluations and detailed explanations in the "Preface and Catalogue to the Selected Prints of Käthe Kollwitz," is also on display here.

    The modern prints of the German Democratic Republic exhibited at the Artists Association Exhibition Hall mostly depict the socialist labor and happy life of the working people of the German Democratic Republic. There are also many prints expressing the friendship between the Chinese and German peoples.

    Also attending the opening ceremony today were Liu Kaifeng, Vice President of the Sino-German Democratic Republic Friendship Association, Liu Kaiqu, Vice Chairman of the Artists Association, and well-known printmakers Li Hua, Li Qun, and others.

    Professor Zellerditsch, a printmaker from the German Democratic Republic, and personnel from the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic also attended the opening ceremony.

    庆祝德意志民主共和国建国十一周年
    德版画展览会在京开幕
    新华社7日讯　为庆祝德意志民主共和国建国十一周年，由对外文化联络委员会、中国德意志民主共和国友好协会、中国美术家协会联合举办的“德意志六百年的版画展览”和由文化部、对外文化联络委员会联合举办的“德意志民主共和国现代版画展览”，今天上午在中山公园水榭举行了开幕式。
    开幕式由对外文化联络委员会副主任屈武主持。外交部副部长罗贵波、文化部副部长夏衍和德意志民主共和国驻华大使汪戴尔出席了开幕式。
    中国美术家协会副主席蔡若虹在开幕式上讲了话。他首先代表对外文化联络委员会、中国德意志民主共和国友好协会和中国美术家协会，预祝展览会展出成功。
    他说，德国的版画艺术，不仅有悠久的历史和丰富的遗产，而且有辉煌的成就，它在德国和世界艺术史上都具有重要地位。
    蔡若虹说，二十世纪德国伟大的革命现实主义版画家凯绥·珂勒惠支的名字对中国艺术家是非常亲切的，鲁迅先生在1936年曾有专集介绍过她的作品，她的具有战斗性的艺术作品一直为中国人民所喜爱，对中国的革命艺术具有很大影响。
    蔡若虹最后说：德意志民主共和国建国已十一周年了，勤劳、勇敢的德意志民主共和国人民在德国统一社会党领导下，在伟大的社会主义建设中取得了辉煌的成就，我们在此致以热烈的祝贺。
    德意志民主共和国大使馆一等秘书布里在讲话中谈到德国版画艺术的人民性和革命传统以后说，德意志民主共和国不仅保护了伟大艺术家的遗产，而且随着社会主义的发展，社会主义艺术正在繁荣和成长。与此相反，波恩政权则企图使艺术脱离人民、敌视一切进步和宣扬帝国主义战争。德意志民主共和国成了整个德国的进步和社会主义艺术的故乡。
    今天在中山公园水榭展出的德意志六百年的版画，包括十五世纪到二十世纪初德国各个历史时期的精美作品二百多幅，其中有许多是世界著名艺术家的珍贵的版画原作。这里有著名版画家丢勒反映德国农民革命时期的铜版画，也有克林格尔等表现资产阶级民主革命时代的铜版、石版和腐蚀版版画。鲁迅在“凯绥·珂勒惠支版画选集序目”中作过很高评价和详细解说的“职工暴动组画”（即“职工一揆”）也在这里展出。
    在美协展览馆展出的德意志民主共和国现代版画，大部分是描写德意志民主共和国劳动人民的社会主义劳动和幸福生活的。其中也有不少版画表达了中德两国人民的友谊。
    出席今天开幕式的，还有中国德意志民主共和国友好协会副会长刘凯风、美协副主席刘开渠和著名版画家李桦、力群等。
    德意志民主共和国版画家哲伦迪希教授和德意志民主共和国大使馆人员也参加了开幕式。
