Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar. A gathering was held in Ulaanbaatar on the evening of the 25th to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the establishment of Mongolian health and medical institutions.

Mongolian party and government leaders Molomjamts, Baljinyam, Dugersuren, Lhamsuren, and others attended the celebration. Health delegations and representatives from the Soviet Union, China, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, and other countries, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to Mongolia, were also invited to attend the celebration. The Chinese delegation was led by Minister of Health Li Dequan.

Mongolian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Lhamsuren said in his speech that since the establishment of Mongolian health and medical institutions 35 years ago, Mongolia's health undertakings have made great achievements. Thirty-five years ago, Mongolia did not have a single medical institution. Now, Ulaanbaatar and the capitals of all provinces have joint hospitals and specialized hospitals. One-fourth of the counties nationwide have large medical stations. All counties have small medical stations. The number of medical personnel of Mongolian nationality is constantly increasing. He said that Mongolia has eliminated infectious diseases left over from feudal society, and the population is gradually increasing. The achievements in health are a victory achieved in the era of the people's revolution.

Mongolian Minister of Health Tuwang then spoke, detailing the achievements of Mongolia's health and medical services, and put forward the current tasks of medical workers. He called on Mongolian medical workers to continuously improve their technical level, raise their communist consciousness, and more successfully complete the glorious task of serving the people.

The head of the Soviet health delegation, Ashurkov, editor-in-chief of the Soviet newspaper "Medical Workers," the head of the Chinese health delegation, Minister of Health Li Dequan, and representatives from Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Hungary also spoke at the meeting, congratulating the Mongolian medical personnel on their achievements. The Mongolian Ministry of Health also held an exhibition on the achievements of Mongolia's medical and health services in commemoration of the festival.

    我卫生代表团参加蒙医疗机构成立三十五周年庆祝活动
    新华社乌兰巴托电　乌兰巴托市25日晚上举行集会，庆祝蒙古卫生医疗机构成立三十五周年。
    蒙古党政领导人莫洛姆扎木茨、巴尔吉尼雅姆、杜格苏伦、拉姆苏伦等人出席了庆祝会。应邀前来的苏联、中国、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚和匈牙利等国的卫生代表团和代表、各国驻蒙古的外交使节也出席了庆祝会。中国代表团由卫生部长李德全率领。
    蒙古部长会议副主席拉姆苏伦在会上讲话说，蒙古卫生医疗机构成立三十五年以来，蒙古卫生事业取得了很大成就。三十五年前，蒙古没有一个医疗机构。现在乌兰巴托市和各省省会都有联合医院和专科医院。全国四分之一的县有了大型医疗站。所有的县都有小型医疗站。本民族的医务人员在不断增加。他说，蒙古已经消灭了封建社会遗留下来的传染病，人口逐渐增长。卫生事业的成就是人民革命年代取得的一个胜利。
    蒙古卫生部部长图旺接着讲话，详细地谈到了蒙古卫生医疗事业的成就，并提出了医疗工作人员当前的任务。他号召蒙古医务工作者不断地提高技术水平，提高共产主义觉悟，更加出色地完成为人民服务的光荣任务。
    苏联卫生代表团团长、苏联“医务工作者报”总编辑阿舒尔科夫，中国卫生代表团团长、卫生部长李德全，以及捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚和匈牙利的代表也在会上讲了话，祝贺蒙古医务人员所取得的成就。蒙古卫生部为纪念节日还举办了蒙古医疗卫生事业成就展览会。
