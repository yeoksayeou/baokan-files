Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 11th - Wang Wei, the head of the Chinese student delegation attending the 6th Congress of the International Union of Students in Baghdad, said in his speech to the congress on the 10th: Since the 5th Congress of the International Union of Students, the world student movement has made tremendous progress over the past two years. Students from all countries have actively engaged in the struggle to defend world peace, oppose imperialism and colonialism, and strive for democracy and freedom, actively launching struggles to achieve educational democratization and improve learning and living conditions, and making efforts to expand friendly exchanges and contacts between students from various countries. Now, the world democratic student movement has become a heroic shock force for the people of the world in their struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace.

Wang Wei pointed out: The policy of aggression and war pursued by imperialists headed by the United States has inspired the revolutionary will of the people and students all over the world, prompting them to unite in struggle. Facts have proven that victory inevitably belongs to the people and students who are united and courageous enough to wage a tit-for-tat struggle against imperialism and its lackeys. Unity is strength, and perseverance in struggle leads to victory. As long as all peace-loving forces in the world persist in their struggle, the imperialists' policy of aggression and war can be further defeated, and their conspiracy to launch a world war can be postponed or even stopped. The imperialists, with the help of atomic blackmail, attempt to obliterate the students' fighting spirit, making them afraid to rise up and fight. However, the students of all countries and the people of their countries have not been intimidated by the imperialists' atomic blackmail in the slightest. The lyrics of the International Union of Students song say it very well, "Atomic bombs cannot weaken our struggle."

After praising the national and democratic struggles of students in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the struggles of European students in defense of peace, Wang Wei said that Chinese students firmly support the just struggles of the people and students of Japan, Laos, Algeria, Congo, Cuba, Panama, Puerto Rico, Oman, Palestine, Turkey, and South Korea. We resolutely support the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin American countries and the struggles of the people in capitalist countries for democracy, freedom, and social progress.

Wang Wei said: The imperialists headed by the United States shamelessly disguise themselves as "messengers of peace," using bait to deceive the people everywhere. However, countless facts have revealed the true face of these robbers: they pretend to be friendly, but in reality, they are carrying out aggression; they wave the banner of peace, but in reality, they are preparing for war. U.S. imperialists viciously slander socialist countries, especially China, as "belligerent" in order to conceal their conspiracies of war and aggression. The fact is that we Chinese people love peace and have always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, universal disarmament, and the settlement of international disputes through negotiations. As early as 1954, the Chinese government jointly initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with the governments of India and Burma, and established peaceful and coexisting diplomatic relations with many Asian, African, and European countries based on these principles. Recently, our Premier Zhou Enlai once again suggested that countries in Asia and the Pacific region, including the United States, sign a treaty of mutual non-aggression and peace to make this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone. This proposal has been widely welcomed by public opinion in Asia and around the world, but the U.S. government has rudely rejected this peace initiative. Our government has also been conducting ambassadorial-level talks with the U.S. government in Warsaw for five years, with a total of one hundred meetings. However, due to the U.S. imperialists' persistent policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, no agreement has been reached so far.

He said that people cannot help but ask: Who has sent more than 1.5 million troops to foreign countries to infringe upon and threaten the sovereignty and independence of other countries? Who sent spy planes to invade Soviet airspace and should bear full responsibility for undermining the Four-Power Summit? Who, under the banner of the United Nations, is suppressing the national independence movement in the Congo, splitting the territory of the Congo, and interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo? Who is plotting to make Congolese fight Congolese, Africans fight Africans? Who has forcibly occupied China's territory of Taiwan, and whose planes and warships have violated China's airspace and territorial waters more than 120 times since September 7, 1958? There is only one answer to these questions: U.S. imperialism.

He said that many representatives in their speeches exposed the crimes of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism has done all kinds of bad things. U.S. imperialism has confessed through its own actions that it is the most dangerous enemy of peace in Asia and the world.

Wang Wei said that while imperialism and its lackeys in various countries are intensifying their suppression of the student movement, they are also trying to poison and paralyze the students' minds spiritually in order to achieve their goal of maintaining reactionary rule. They are doing everything possible to spread their decadent way of life through yellow books and movies, attempting to lure students away from political struggles, lose their vigor, and abandon progressive ideals. This conspiracy of imperialism has also been resolutely opposed by students from all countries.

Wang Wei, in referring to the United Nations General Assembly meeting currently in session, said that in the past few years, the United Nations has passed a series of reactionary resolutions and taken a series of reactionary actions, which are in complete violation of the United Nations Charter. It is enough to mention just the most recent examples. Recently, U.S. imperialism, under the guise of the United Nations, carried out arbitrary interference and aggression against the Congo. The United Nations General Assembly has decided for the fifth time to include the so-called "Hungarian question" on the agenda, and for the second time to include the so-called "Tibetan question" on the agenda. To this day, the United Nations refuses to restore the legitimate seat of the 650 million Chinese people in the United Nations. All of this is a serious provocation to the peace-loving and justice-seeking people of the world.

He said that the ongoing discussions at the United Nations on the elimination of the colonial system are undoubtedly a major event. The United Nations should recognize and guarantee the right of the people of colonial countries to decide their own destiny and choose their own national system. We believe that the struggle for national independence must first rely on the resolute struggle of the masses of people in each country. At the same time, this does not preclude the possibility of holding negotiations on an equal footing. In the process of negotiation, it is necessary to expose the deceptive conspiracies of imperialism and colonialism, and negotiations must be supported by the struggles of the masses.

He pointed out that the United Nations, under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, has repeatedly violated the United Nations Charter and condoned colonial countries in interfering in the independence movements of the people of colonial countries. We must not harbor any unrealistic illusions about the United Nations.

After Wang Wei spoke of the continuous struggles of students in the capitalist world to achieve educational democratization and improve their learning and living conditions, he said: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, Chinese students are working hard to study and train themselves to become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, serving the people. Last year, the number of students in Chinese universities and colleges reached 810,000. Adding the 300,000 students in night universities and correspondence schools, the total reached 1.1 million, which is ten times that of 1949. Our educational work has made tremendous progress.

Wang Wei said: In the past two years, in the struggle for world peace and against imperialism, students from all countries have supported and encouraged each other, thereby further strengthening their friendship and unity. This is an extremely important factor for the victory of our common cause, and we regard promoting the unity of international students as our sacred responsibility.

He said that Chinese students have maintained close unity with students from socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. Our friendship and unity with students from Asian, African, and Latin American countries has also made tremendous progress. We have established friendly relations with 118 student organizations in 87 countries. We sincerely hope to continue to consolidate and expand this friendly exchange and contact and contribute to our common cause.

Wang Wei condemned imperialism and its lackeys for doing everything possible to undermine the unity of the international student movement. He said that the facts very clearly prove that all obstacles hindering the unification of the international student movement come from the leadership group of the Liaison Secretariat of the International Student Conference. The All-China Students' Federation advocates the unification of the world student movement on the basis of the program of striving for peace, opposing imperialism and colonialism, striving for educational democratization and the important rights of students; we believe that negotiations and round table meetings should be held on an equal footing. Chinese students will work tirelessly with full confidence to strengthen solidarity and cooperation between students from all countries.

Wang Wei said that the tremendous development of the international student movement in the past two years has once again proved the correctness of the International Union of Students' program of defending world peace, opposing imperialism and colonialism, and striving for educational democratization. This program reflects the common aspirations and demands of the vast number of students.

Wang Wei concluded by saying that in today's world, the forces of peace have overwhelmed the forces of war, the forces of the people have overwhelmed the forces of reaction, and the forces of socialism have overwhelmed the forces of imperialism. Our task is to make full use of the current excellent situation, form the broadest united front of world students against imperialism headed by the United States, and educate students from all countries with the great ideals of uniting against imperialism and colonialism, striving for world peace, achieving national independence, democratic freedom, and social progress, and inspire them to fight with full confidence and determination. Victory will surely belong to the world democratic student movement.

The speech of the Chinese delegation was warmly welcomed by the whole audience. After Wang Wei's speech, many representatives came to shake hands and embrace the Chinese representatives. The Iraqi Student Union representative said that the Chinese representative's speech was combative and inspiring, and was the best gift they had received.

    中国代表王伟在国际学联第六次代表大会上发言
    揭露美帝国主义的侵略扩张罪行
    支持各国学生反帝爱国正义斗争
    新华社巴格达11日电　出席在巴格达举行的国际学生联合会第六次代表大会的中国学生代表团团长王伟10日在大会上发言说：自从国际学联第五次代表大会召开以来的两年中，世界学生运动有了巨大的发展。各国学生积极地投入了保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义、殖民主义、和争取民主自由的斗争，积极展开了争取教育民主化、改善学习和生活条件的斗争，为扩大各国学生之间的友好来往和联系作出了努力。现在，世界民主学生运动已经成为全世界人民反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平斗争的一支英勇的突击队。
    王伟指出：以美国为首的帝国主义者奉行的侵略和战争政策激发了全世界人民和学生的革命斗志，促使他们在斗争中团结起来。事实已经证明，胜利必然属于团结一致而英勇地敢于同帝国主义及其走狗进行针锋相对的斗争的人民和学生。团结就是力量，坚持斗争就能胜利。只要全世界爱好和平的力量坚持斗争，帝国主义的侵略和战争政策可以进一步被击败，他们发动世界战争的阴谋可以被推迟以至被制止。帝国主义者借助于原子讹诈，企图磨灭学生们的斗志，使他们不敢起来进行斗争，可是各国学生和他们国家的人民丝毫也没有被帝国主义者的原子讹诈所吓倒。国际学生联合会歌词说得非常好，“原子弹不能削弱我们的斗争”。
    在赞扬了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国学生的民族民主斗争和欧洲学生保卫和平的斗争后，王伟说，中国学生坚决支持日本、老挝、阿尔及利亚、刚果、古巴、巴拿马、波多黎各、阿曼、巴勒斯坦、土耳其和南朝鲜人民和学生所进行的正义斗争。我们坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的民族民主运动和资本主义国家人民争取民主、自由和社会进步的斗争。
    王伟说：以美国为首的帝国主义者厚颜无耻地把自己装扮成“和平使者”，到处用诱饵欺骗人民。但是无数的事实揭露了这些强盗的真面目，他们假装友好，实际上在进行侵略，他们打着和平的幌子，实际上在准备战争。美帝国主义者恶毒地诬蔑社会主义国家特别是诬蔑中国“好战”以掩盖它的战争和侵略的阴谋。事实是：我们中国人民热爱和平，一贯主张不同社会制度的国家之间和平共处，主张普遍裁军和用谈判解决国际争端。中国政府早在1954年就与印度和缅甸政府共同倡导了和平共处五项原则，并且根据这些原则同许多亚非国家和欧洲的一些国家建立了和平共处的外交关系。最近，我国总理周恩来再一次建议亚洲和太平洋沿岸国家包括美国在内，签订互不侵犯的和平公约，使这个区域成为无核武器地区。这个建议受到了亚洲和世界各国舆论的广泛欢迎，而美国政府却粗暴地拒绝了这个和平倡议。我国政府还和美国政府在华沙进行大使级谈判，时间已达五年，会谈共有百次，由于美帝国主义一直坚持其敌视中国人民的政策，迄今未能达成协议。
    他说，人们不禁要问：是谁在外国派遣了一百五十多万军队，侵犯和威胁别国的主权和独立？是谁派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联的领空而要对破坏四国首脑会议负完全的责任？是谁打着联合国的旗号，镇压刚果的民族独立运动，分裂刚果的领土，干涉刚果的内政？是谁在策划使刚果人打刚果人，非洲人打非洲人？是谁用武力侵占了中国的领土台湾，是谁的飞机、军舰从1958年9月7日起至今侵犯中国的领空和领海达一百二十多次？对这些问题只有一个答案，就是美帝国主义。
    他说，许多代表在他们的发言中揭露美帝国主义的罪行。美帝国主义做尽了一切坏事。美帝国主义用自己的行动招供了它是亚洲和世界和平的最危险的敌人。
    王伟说，帝国主义及其在各国的走狗在加紧镇压学生运动的同时，又从精神上力图毒化和麻痹学生的思想，以便实现他们保持反动统治的目的。他们千方百计地通过黄色书刊和电影等等来传播其腐化没落的生活方式，企图借此引诱学生脱离政治斗争，丧失朝气，并抛弃进步的理想。帝国主义的这种阴谋也遭到了各国学生的坚决反对。
    王伟在谈到目前正在举行的联合国大会会议时说，在过去几年中，联合国通过了一系列的反动决议，采取了一系列的反动行动，这些决议和行动是完全违反联合国宪章的。只要提一提最近的例子就足够了。最近，美帝国主义披着联合国的外衣，对刚果进行专横的干涉和侵略。联合国大会已经第五次决定把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入议程，第二次把所谓“西藏问题”列入议程。直到现在，联合国拒绝恢复六亿五千万中国人民在联合国中的合法席位。所有这一切都是对全世界爱好和平和主张正义的人民的严重挑衅。
    他说，联合国目前正在进行的关于消灭殖民制度的讨论，无疑是一件大事。联合国应当承认和保证殖民地国家的人民决定自己的命运和选择自己的国家制度的权利。我们认为，争取民族独立，必须首先依靠各国人民大众的坚决斗争。同时，这并不排除在平等的基础上举行谈判的可能性。在谈判的过程中，必须注意揭露帝国主义和殖民主义的欺骗阴谋，谈判必须以群众的斗争来支持。
    他指出，联合国在美帝国主义的操纵下，一再地破坏联合国宪章，纵容殖民主义国家对殖民地国家人民独立运动进行干涉。我们对于联合国决不应当怀有任何不切实际的幻想。
    王伟在谈到资本主义世界的学生为争取教育民主化和改善学习和生活条件所进行的不断奋斗以后说：在中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，中国学生正在努力学习和努力地锻炼自己，使自己成为具有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者，为人民服务。去年，中国高等学校在校学生人数已达八十一万人。加上夜大学和函授学校的三十万学生，共达一百一十万人，即相当于1949年的十倍。我国的教育工作有了巨大发展。
    王伟说：近两年来，在争取世界和平和反对帝国主义的斗争中，各国学生相互支持、相互鼓舞，从而进一步加强了相互间的友谊和团结。这是我们的共同事业获得胜利的极为重要的因素，我们把促进国际学生的团结当作是自己神圣的责任。
    他说，中国学生与以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国学生保持了亲密的团结。我们和亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国学生的友谊和团结也有了巨大的发展。我们同八十七个国家的一百一十八个学生组织建立了友好的联系。我们真诚地希望继续巩固和扩大这种友好的往来和联系，为我们的共同事业作出贡献。
    王伟谴责帝国主义及其走狗千方百计地破坏国际学生运动的团结。他说，事实非常清楚地证明，阻碍国际学生运动统一的一切障碍来自国际学生会议联络秘书处的领导集团。中华全国学生联合会主张在争取和平，反对帝国主义和殖民主义，争取教育民主化和学生的重要权利的纲领的基础上，实现世界学生运动的统一；我们认为，谈判和圆桌会议应当在对等的基础上举行。中国学生将满怀信心不倦地为加强各国学生之间的团结和合作而努力。
    王伟说，两年以来，国际学生运动的巨大发展，再一次地证明了国际学联为保卫世界和平，反对帝国主义和殖民主义，争取教育民主化的纲领的正确。这一纲领反映了广大学生的共同愿望和要求。
    王伟最后说，在今天的世界上，和平力量已经压倒了战争力量，人民的力量压倒了反动力量，社会主义力量压倒了帝国主义的力量。我们的任务是要充分利用目前的大好形势，结成世界学生反对以美国为首的帝国主义的最广泛的统一阵线，以团结起来反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取世界和平、实现民族独立、民主自由和社会进步的伟大理想教育各国学生，鼓舞他们以充分的信心和决心进行斗争。胜利一定属于世界民主学生运动。
    中国代表团的发言受到全场的热烈欢迎，在王伟发言结束后许多代表纷纷来找中国代表握手拥抱，伊拉克学联代表说，中国代表的发言有战斗性，鼓舞人心，是给他们带来的最好的礼物。
