Xinhua News Agency, October 25th. The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs hosted a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the Somali Republic Parliamentary Delegation, which is currently visiting China. The members of the delegation include Mohamed Ghiyanaago Ghiffumale, Secretary of the Parliament of the Somali Republic.

In his speech at the banquet, Hu Yuzhi, Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, congratulated the Somali people on gaining national independence after a long struggle against imperialism.

Hu Yuzhi said that the Chinese people firmly support the Somali people's struggle to achieve complete independence and resolutely support the African people's struggle against colonialism and for national independence. In order to strengthen the mutual support between the Chinese and Somali people in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism, we hope to enhance friendly exchanges between the peoples of our two countries and further develop relations between our two countries.

Hu Yuzhi pointed out that today, U.S. imperialism is the most important, the most vicious, and the common enemy of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It is invading Africa in various ways to replace the rule of old-brand colonialism. He said that as long as the African people further unite broadly and carry out struggles, they will surely achieve complete victory.

Hu Yuzhi severely condemned the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas" in an attempt to undermine the friendship between the Chinese and Somali people. He pointed out that the Somali people firmly demand the development of friendly exchanges with the Chinese people, and the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas" is bound to fail. He said that the Somali government has rejected the representatives of the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the Chinese people warmly welcome this friendly stance of the Somali government.

Hu Yuzhi firmly believes that the Somali parliamentary delegation's visit to China will further promote mutual understanding and friendly relations between the Chinese and Somali people. He welcomes more Somali friends to visit China.

Sogole Mohamed Mohamed, a member of the Somali Republic Parliament, spoke on behalf of the Somali parliamentary delegation. He conveyed the brotherly friendship and respect of the Somali people to the Chinese people and thanked the Chinese people for their warm reception.

Sogole said: "We thank the Chinese people for continuing to wage a struggle against imperialism. We came to China and saw with our own eyes that the Chinese people, whether workers, soldiers, or people from other walks of life, have a high degree of anti-imperialist passion. We hope to see such a high degree of anti-imperialist passion in all African countries."

Sogole said: "We Somalis have been subjected to imperialist aggression and oppression for more than 70 years, and now we demand complete liberation. We very much hope to live like the people of Asian and African countries that have gained independence, especially like the Chinese people. We hope that China and other Asian and African countries will support our struggle against imperialism."

Attending the banquet were Lian Guan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Qu Wu, Vice President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association; Wu Maosun, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs; Wu Xiaoda, Deputy Secretary-General; Zhang Jie, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association; and Liu Kefan, Deputy Head of the Chinese Muslim Hajj Delegation who had visited the Somali Republic.

He Ying, Director of the West Asian and African Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and He Gongkai, Deputy Director, also attended the banquet.

Lu Xuzhang, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, met on the 24th with members of the Somali Republic Parliamentary Delegation: Mohamed Ghiyanaago Ghiffumale, Secretary of Parliament; Sogole Mohamed Mohamed, Member of Parliament; and Nur Mohamed Hussein Ousman, Member of Parliament.

    外交学会欢宴索马里议员访华团
    新华社25日讯　中国人民外交学会今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎正在我国访问的索马里共和国议员访华团。访华团成员中，包括索马里共和国议会秘书穆罕默德·吉雅纳戈·吉符马勒。
    中国人民外交学会副会长胡愈之在宴会上的讲话中对索马里人民经过长期反对帝国主义的斗争而获得了国家的独立表示祝贺。
    胡愈之说，中国人民坚决支持索马里人民为获得完全的独立而进行的斗争，坚决支持非洲人民反对殖民主义，争取民族独立的斗争。为了加强中索两国人民在反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的共同斗争中的互相支持，我们希望增进两国人民之间的友好往来和进一步发展我们两国之间的关系。
    胡愈之指出，今天美帝国主义是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民最主要的、最凶恶的、共同的敌人，它正在以各种方式侵入非洲，以代替老牌殖民主义的统治。他说，只要非洲人民进一步广泛地团结起来，进行斗争，就一定能够获得完全的胜利。
    胡愈之严厉斥责美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋，以图破坏中索两国人民之间的友谊。他指出，索马里人民坚决要求发展和中国人民之间的友好往来，美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋是肯定要失败的。他说，索马里政府拒绝了反动的蒋介石集团的代表，中国人民热烈欢迎索马里政府的这一友好的立场。
    胡愈之深信，索马里议员团这次访问中国，必将进一步促进中索两国人民之间的相互了解和友好关系。他欢迎更多的索马里朋友们来中国访问。
    索马里共和国议员索戈勒·穆罕默德·穆罕默德代表索马里议员团讲话。他转达了索马里人民对中国人民的兄弟般的友情和敬意，并且感谢中国人民的盛情接待。
    索戈勒说：“我们感谢中国人民在继续不断地进行反对帝国主义的斗争。我们来到中国，亲眼看到了中国人民，不论是工人、士兵和其他各阶层人民，都有着高度的反对帝国主义的激情。我们希望在所有非洲国家都能看到这样高度的反对帝国主义的激情。”
    索戈勒说：“我们索马里受到帝国主义的侵略和压迫达七十多年，现在我们要求得到完全的解放。我们十分希望能像亚洲、非洲获得了独立的国家的人民，特别像中国人民这样地生活。我们希望中国和亚洲、非洲其他国家支援我们反对帝国主义的斗争。”
