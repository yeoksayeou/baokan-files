Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th—News: 180,000 Japanese coal miners held a nationwide general strike today in support of the Miike coal miners' struggle against mass layoffs and against the monopolistic capitalists' forced implementation of "enterprise rationalization" plans that sacrifice the interests of workers.

　　Workers from fourteen major coal mining companies, including Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo, participated in the strike.

　　Mitsui Mining Co., belonging to the Mitsui Zaibatsu, recently laid off 1,200 coal miners from the Miike Coal Mine and recently attempted to punish union activists under the pretext of "investigating workers' violent acts during the labor unrest," in order to undermine the union.

　　Monopoly capitalists also demanded that the laid-off workers move out of the company dormitories within two months and refused to pay temporary subsidies to members of the Miike Coal Mine Union. On the 25th, the monopoly capitalists unilaterally announced the suspension of negotiations between labor and management representatives and submitted these issues to the government's Central Labor Relations Commission for "mediation."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th—News: 150,000 Japanese university students held rallies and demonstrations across the country today, demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the resignation of the Ikeda Cabinet, and protesting the assassination of Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

　　Students from twenty-two universities in Tokyo, Osaka, Sapporo, and other places participated in today's unified action.

　　In Tokyo, more than 700 students held a rally under the auspices of the All-Japan Student Self-Government Association Liaison Council. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution strongly condemning the Ikeda Cabinet for strengthening the "Security Treaty" system and instigating right-wing terrorists to assassinate Asanuma, provoking the Japanese people who demand peace and independence.

　　The resolution firmly stated that they would strengthen the student ranks to overthrow the Ikeda Cabinet.

　　Japanese Communist Party representative Tokuta Katsumi spoke at the meeting. Tokuta said that now the Japanese people stand on a common front against the revival of militarism and fascism. In order to implement the new "Security Treaty," the Ikeda government is conspiring to suppress democratic forces. However, he pointed out, the Japanese democratic forces are growing stronger, and relying on the unity of the democratic forces will surely be able to stop the revival of fascism.

　　He stated that the Communist Party will fight to smash the reactionaries' conspiracy.

　　Socialist Party representative Okada Munetsugu pointed out at the meeting that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a hotbed for the activities of fascists.

　　After the meeting, all the participants held demonstrations in front of the Diet Building and the Prime Minister's Residence. Today, several other groups of students in Tokyo held rallies and demonstrations to overthrow the Ikeda Cabinet.

　　Tokyo police authorities dispatched nearly 5,000 police officers today to be stationed around the Diet Building and the Prime Minister's Residence.

    支持三池矿工反解雇反迫害的斗争
    日本十八万煤矿工人举行大罢工
    十五万大学生示威游行要求池田内阁下台
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本十八万煤矿工人今天曾经在全国举行大罢工，支援三池煤矿工人反对大批解雇工人的斗争，反对垄断资本家强制实行牺牲工人利益的“企业合理化”计划。
    参加罢工的包括三菱、三井、住友等十四家大煤矿公司的工人。
    属于三井财阀的三井矿山公司不久以前解雇了三池煤矿的一千二百名煤矿工人，最近又假借“追究工潮中工人的暴力行为”名义，企图处罚工会积极分子，借以破坏工会。
    垄断资本家还要求被解雇工人在两个月以内搬出公司宿舍，并拒绝向三池煤矿工会会员支付临时补贴。垄断资本家还在25日片面宣布停止劳资双方代表的谈判，并把这些问题提交政府的中央劳动委员会进行“调解”。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本十五万大学生今天在全国举行大会和示威游行，要求废除日美“安全条约”和池田内阁下台，并抗议美日反动派杀害社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎。
    东京、大阪、札幌等地的二十二个大学的学生参加了今天的统一行动。
    在东京，七百多名学生在全国学生自治会联络会议主持下举行了大会。大会一致通过决议，强烈谴责池田内阁加强“安全条约”体系，并唆使右翼恐怖分子杀害浅沼，对要求和平和独立的日本人民进行挑衅。
    决议坚决表示，他们将加强学生的队伍来打倒池田内阁。
    日本共产党代表听涛克已在会上讲话。听涛说，现在，日本人民站在反对复活军国主义和法西斯主义的共同战线上。为了实行新“安全条约”，池田政府正在阴谋镇压民主力量。然而，他指出，日本民主力量日益壮大，依靠民主力量的团结一定能够阻止法西斯主义复活。
    他表示，共产党将为粉碎反动派的阴谋而斗争。
    社会党代表冈田宗司在会上指出，日美“安全条约”是法西斯分子活动的温床。
    大会结束后，全体与会者到国会大厦和首相官邸前面举行了示威游行。今天东京还有另外几批学生举行了打倒池田内阁的大会和示威游行。
    东京警察当局今天出动了将近五千名警察布置在国会大厦和首府官邸周围。
