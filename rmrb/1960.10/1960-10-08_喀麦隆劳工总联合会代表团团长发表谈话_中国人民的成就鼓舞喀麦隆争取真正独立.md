Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Ekala Robert, head of the Cameroonian General Confederation of Labor Delegation visiting our country and secretary of the Cameroonian General Confederation of Labor, said that the Cameroonian people are encouraged by the great achievements of the Chinese people and the true political and economic independence they have achieved. All this encourages the Cameroonian people to fight for their own true independence.

Ekala Robert made these remarks when he and delegation member Ndu Isaac met with Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 5th. He said: "We have all been subjected to imperialist enslavement for a long time, we have a common destiny and a common friendship, a friendship forged in battle." He expressed that the friendship between the Chinese and African people will be further consolidated and developed.

In his speech, Ekala severely condemned the evil activities carried out by imperialism, especially US imperialism, in the Congo under the guise of the United Nations. He said: "The Congo incident once again proves that the United Nations has become a tool of imperialism. At the same time, imperialism, especially US imperialism, has completely exposed its true colors in the Congo incident."

Both Ekala and Isaac particularly emphasized in their speeches that the imperialist system itself means force, exploitation, enslavement, and the pursuit of high profits. They said that we are peace-loving, but imperialism will not automatically give up high profits, the exploitation of colonies, and the policy of force to talk about peace with the people, and the people in the colonies and the enslaved people cannot talk about peace with imperialism either. Ekala asked: "When a robber enters your home, how will he leave if you don't use force—even stones if you don't have weapons—to drive him out?" He pointed out that imperialism is still carrying out aggressive activities everywhere in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and people cannot believe in imperialism's false peace, but only resolutely fight against imperialism. He said that if we relax our vigilance and sleep soundly, peace will not come.

They also talked about the most important task at present is to organize a broad united front against imperialism. Ndu Isaac said: "We believe that with the leadership of the socialist camp, this front will definitely defeat imperialism and enable the people to gain true independence and freedom."

Speaking about his impressions of visiting China, Ekala praised our country's people's communes, emphasizing that the people's communes have completely liberated women. When talking about the various rumors and slanders spread by the imperialist propaganda machine against the people's communes, he said: "Whether in the people's communes or elsewhere, we have seen the Chinese people working with unparalleled excitement and joyful labor. All the imperialists' slanders are nothing more than fabrications for their own benefit." He said that he was particularly moved by the very happy lives of the Chinese workers. He said that the workers recuperating in the Hangzhou Workers' Sanatorium lived a very comfortable life. This sanatorium is built in the most beautiful place and has the most modern equipment. Ekala also praised our country's militia, saying that the militia can be said to be a key to the victory of the struggle against imperialism, and they can be mobilized at any time to eliminate invading enemies locally.

    喀麦隆劳工总联合会代表团团长发表谈话
    中国人民的成就鼓舞喀麦隆争取真正独立
    新华社7日讯　来我国访问的喀麦隆劳工总联合会代表团团长、喀麦隆劳工总联合会书记埃克瓦拉·罗贝尔说，喀麦隆人民为中国人民的巨大成就和他们所取得的政治上和经济上的真正独立而感到鼓舞。这一切鼓舞着喀麦隆人民为自己取得真正的独立而进行斗争。
    埃克瓦拉·罗贝尔是在和代表团团员恩杜·伊萨克一起在5日接见新华社记者时说这些话的。他说：“我们都长期经受过帝国主义的奴役，我们有着共同的命运、共同的友谊，这种友谊是在战斗中结成的。”他表示，中非人民间的友谊将更进一步地巩固和发展。
    埃克瓦拉在谈话中严厉谴责帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义假借联合国名义在刚果所进行的罪恶活动。他说：“刚果事件再一次证明，联合国已成为帝国主义的工具，同时，帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义，也在刚果事件中彻底暴露了它们的真面目。”
    埃克瓦拉和伊萨克在谈话中都特别强调指出，帝国主义制度本身就意味着强力、剥削、奴役和追求高额利润。他们说，我们是热爱和平的，但帝国主义不会自动放弃高额利润、对殖民地的剥削和武力政策而和人民谈和平，殖民地的人民和被奴役的人民也无法与帝国主义谈和平。埃克瓦拉问道：“当一个强盗进入你的家庭，如果不用武力——假如没有武器，就用石头也好——把他赶出去，他怎么会出去呢？”他指出，帝国主义在非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲等地还到处进行侵略活动，人们不能相信帝国主义的假和平，而只有坚决同帝国主义斗争。他说，如果我们放松警惕睡大觉，和平是不会降临的。
    他们还谈到目前最重要的任务是组织一个广泛的反对帝国主义的统一战线，恩杜·伊萨克说：“我们相信，有着社会主义阵营的领导，这一战线一定能战胜帝国主义，使人民得到真正的独立和自由。”
    在谈到访问中国的观感时，埃克瓦拉盛赞我国的人民公社，他强调指出，人民公社彻底解放了妇女。在谈到帝国主义宣传机器对人民公社的种种造谣诬蔑时，他说：“无论在人民公社和其他地方，我们都看到中国人民以无比兴奋的心情和愉快的劳动进行工作。帝国主义的一切谰言都不过是为它们自己的利益而编造的罢了。”他说，使他特别感动的是中国工人得到了非常幸福的生活。他说，在杭州工人疗养院休养的工人过着非常舒适的生活。这座疗养院修建在风景最优美的地方。而且有着最现代化的设备。埃克瓦拉还盛赞我国的民兵，他说，民兵可以说是反对帝国主义斗争胜利的一个关键，他们可以随时动员起来在当地消灭进犯的敌人。
