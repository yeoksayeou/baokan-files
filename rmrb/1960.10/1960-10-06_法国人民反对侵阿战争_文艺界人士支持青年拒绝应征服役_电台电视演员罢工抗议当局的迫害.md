Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 4th - The French government's policy of insisting on suppressing the Algerian people's struggle for independence is becoming increasingly unpopular at home.

One hundred and twenty-one French writers, professors, and figures in the cultural and artistic circles recently jointly issued a declaration supporting French youth who refuse to be conscripted into the army to serve the French colonialists in Algeria. This declaration received widespread response, and subsequently, many well-known public figures signed the declaration; it is reported that at least one hundred and eighty people have now signed the declaration.

The French ruling group is attempting to stifle opposing opinions by using high-pressure tactics to eliminate obstacles to continuing its colonial policy in Algeria. Shortly after the declaration was issued, the French cabinet, on September 21, passed a decree targeting the declaration, stipulating that those who "incite insubordination" and "harbor insubordinates" should be given the maximum penalty. Immediately afterwards, the authorities took a series of persecutory measures against those who had signed the declaration: school teachers who signed the declaration were dismissed or had their salaries reduced, actors were forbidden from performing on state-run radio and television stations and in state-subsidized theaters, publishing houses deemed to be connected to the declaration were searched, and many people were summoned for questioning...

At the same time, a group of French citizens accused of sympathizing with the "Algerian National Liberation Front" were sentenced to heavy prison terms by military tribunals; fourteen of them were sentenced to ten years in prison and heavy fines.

These brutal suppression measures by the French authorities have aroused great indignation in public opinion. In order to protest the authorities' persecution of the signatories, French radio and television actors began a "warning strike" from midnight on the 2nd. This strike was still ongoing as of the morning of the 4th local time. Prior to this, the staff of the state-owned "Butte Chaumont" photographic studio in Paris also held a strike on the evening of the 1st.

The French "National Education Federation," the "National Union of Higher Education Teachers," the French Actors' Union, and the National Federation of Theater Industry also protested against the French government's suppression of civil rights.

Five hundred young people recently demonstrated in front of the Ivry City Hall in the suburbs of Paris. These young people shouted: "No conscription of eighteen-year-olds!" "No dispatch of detachments to Algeria!" They then held a demonstration parade on the streets of Paris. They received support from workers in many enterprises and from citizens.

    文艺界人士支持青年拒绝应征服役
    电台电视演员罢工抗议当局的迫害
    新华社巴黎4日电　法国政府坚持镇压阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争的政策，在国内越来越不得人心。
    一百二十一位法国作家、教授和文化艺术界人士最近曾联名发表宣言，支持法国青年拒绝应征去阿尔及利亚为法国殖民主义者服役。这个宣言得到了广泛响应，随后又有许多知名社会人士在宣言上签了名；据报道，目前，在这个宣言上签名的至少已经有一百八十人。
    法国统治集团企图用高压手段扼杀舆论的反对，以消除继续在阿尔及利亚推行殖民政策的阻力。上述宣言发表后不久，法国内阁就在9月21日针对这个宣言通过一项法令，规定对“煽动不守纪律”和“包庇不守纪律者”的人应给以最大限度的刑罚。紧接着，当局就对曾在宣言上签了名的人采取了一系列的迫害措施：在宣言上签名的学校教师被解除职务或降薪，演员被禁止在国营电台、电视台及接受国家补助的剧院表演节目，被认为同宣言有关连的出版社遭到搜查，许多人受到传讯……
    与此同时，一批被控同情“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线”的法国公民被军事法庭判处重刑；其中十四人被判十年徒刑和巨额罚金。
    法国当局的这些残暴镇压措施，激起了舆论的极大愤慨。为了抗议当局对签名者的迫害，法国电台、电视演员从2日午夜开始举行“警告性罢工”，这一罢工到当地时间4日上午仍在坚持中，在这以前，巴黎国营“布特·沙蒙”摄影场的工作人员也曾在1日晚上举行罢工。
    法国“国民教育联合会”、“高等学校教师全国联合会”、法国演员工会和戏剧业全国联合会也抗议法国政府打击公民权利的做法。
    五百名青年最近在巴黎郊区伊符里市政府面前示威。这些青年高呼：“不准把十八岁的青年征募入伍！”“不准向阿尔及利亚派遣分遣队！”他们接着在巴黎的大街上举行示威游行。他们得到许多企业的工人们以及市民的支持。
