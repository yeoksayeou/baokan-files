    16,000 Kinds of Keys
    The locks manufactured by the Chengming Lock Factory in Yantai, Shandong Province, have always been popular in domestic and international markets. In recent years, they have continuously improved quality and increased variety; iron locks have increased from two types to five, and copper locks from three to seven; the number of key types has expanded from the original 4,000, which were not interchangeable, to 16,000. Due to the increase in variety and continuous innovation in design, product sales have increased daily.
    Everyone in this factory cares about product quality and constantly improves product design and process regulations. For example, technician Zhang Peiqin, workshop director Liu Chaoguang, and worker Chi Changkun jointly studied and improved the design of the 313 iron lock, replacing the spring bolt with a spring hook and changing the copper lock from double-sided opening to single-sided opening. Technician Wang Zhizuo and veteran worker Wang Siguang collaborated to design a semi-automatic nose-bending machine, which made the nose specifications of the locks consistent, increasing the qualification rate from 60% to over 95%. In order to improve product quality, this year the factory augmented its full-time inspectors, and each group also established amateur inspectors, dividing the work and guarding their posts. Those not meeting the blueprint requirements are not passed on to the next process; finished products that do not meet the quality requirements are not allowed to leave the factory. This has played a significant role in improving product quality.

    一万六千种钥匙
    山东省烟台程明造锁厂制造的锁，一向受到国内外市场的欢迎。最近几年又不断提高质量，增加品种；铁锁由二种增加到五种，铜锁由三种增加到七种；钥匙的种类由原来四千种不互相通用，现在扩大到一万六千种。由于品种增多和花样不断翻新，产品销量日增。
    这个厂人人关心产品质量，经常改进产品设计和工艺规程。如技术员张培勤、车间主任刘朝光和工人迟常坤共同研究改进了三一三铁锁的设计，用簧钩代替了拴簧，把铜锁由两面开改为一面开。技术员王之佐和老工人王嗣光合作，设计成功了一台半自动屈鼻机，使锁的屈鼻规格一致，合格率由60％提高到95％以上。为了提高产品质量，这个厂今年充实了专职检查员，每个小组还设立了业余检查员，分兵把口，不符合图纸要求的，不向下道工序交；成品达不到质量要求的不准出厂。这对提高产品质量起了不小作用。
