Launching Socialist Labor Emulation Between Work Processes
Changchun Steel Plant Iron Consumption Drops Again and Again

(Our newspaper Changchun, 25th dispatch) The workers of the No. 2 Steelmaking Workshop of Changchun Steel Plant are actively saving pig iron. In September, the average iron consumption per ton of steel was only 1,152 kilograms, which is 148 kilograms lower than the national standard and 110 kilograms lower than in July, which had the lowest iron consumption.

In the activity of saving pig iron, the Party branch of the workshop, based on the characteristic that reducing iron consumption is closely related to all aspects of steelmaking, organized workers to widely carry out the "Four Hundreds" and "Five Speeds" continuous large-scale competition: one hundred heats without scrap steel, one hundred heats without zero-grade steel, one hundred heats without low-temperature steel, one hundred heats without running steel, and fast material transportation, fast charging, fast iron mixing, fast pouring, and fast ingot removal. This makes the main processes such as material transportation, charging, and wind eye observation of the melting furnace and the rocking, blowing, ingot removal, and ingot transportation of the converter closely linked, shortening the process handover time, ensuring that iron consumption gradually decreases, and improving the quality of steel ingots.

This workshop also made full use of past scrap steel to make steel, which also saved pig iron. In September, they produced more than 400 tons of steel from scrap steel. (Attached picture)

Xinhua News Agency reporter You Yungu photographed workers at the Leshan Iron and Steel Plant in Sichuan weighing coke, which is required to be weighed before entering the furnace to ensure that the amount of coke used is based on the furnace's specifications and planned material usage. This allows the plant to save about one-tenth of the coke entering the plant every day. This is the No. 1 blast furnace worker weighing coke.

    开展工序之间社会主义劳动竞赛
    长春钢厂铁耗一降再降
    本报长春25日电　长春市钢厂第二炼钢车间职工积极节约生铁，9月份平均每吨钢的耗铁量只有一千一百五十二公斤，比国家标准低一百四十八公斤，比耗铁最低的7月份下降一百一十公斤。
    在节约生铁的活动中，车间党支部根据降低铁耗跟炼钢各个环节都有密切关系这一特点，组织职工广泛开展了百炉无废钢、百炉无零号钢、百炉无低温钢、百炉不跑钢和运料快、上料快、合铁水快、浇注快、排锭快的“四百”、“五快”连环大竞赛，使化铁炉的运料、上料、看风眼和转炉的摇炉、吹炼、排锭、运锭等主要工序环环扣紧，缩短了工序交接时间，保证铁耗逐渐降低，提高钢锭质量。
    这个车间还充分利用过去的废钢铁炼钢，也节约了生铁。9月份他们用废钢铁炼出的钢就有四百多吨。（附图片）
