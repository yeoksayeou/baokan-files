"Sun Wukong" Gains Fame in Bucharest
On the Performance of the China Puppet Art Troupe at the Second International Puppet and Marionette Theatre Festival
By Our Correspondent Wei Lingbing

One day, on the stage of the Bucharest Trade Union Theatre, an underwater palace with exquisite pavilions and towers appeared, with fish, turtles, shrimps, and crabs swimming in crystal-clear water. Four beautiful goldfish swam towards the palace, and with a single dive, they all transformed into graceful fairies, who then began to dance gracefully. At that moment, enthusiastic applause erupted in the theatre. This was a scene from the China Puppet Art Troupe's performance of "Sun Wukong Thrice Borrows the Banana Fan."

From September 15th to 30th, the Second International Puppet and Marionette Theatre Festival was held in Bucharest. During this time, puppet and marionette troupes from twenty-five countries, including the Soviet Union, China, and Romania, participated in this grand performance. In addition, hundreds of puppet and marionette theatre workers from around the world came to observe. This was the first time the China Puppet Art Troupe had participated in such an international event. They performed a total of five programs: "Sun Wukong Thrice Borrows the Banana Fan," "Daming Prefecture," "Lei Wanchun Fights the Tiger," "Celebrating the Harvest," and "The Flood of Jinshan Temple." Our China Puppet Art Troupe won the second prize at this theatre festival (no grand prize was awarded this time, and there was only one second prize winner), receiving a silver medal; the programs "Daming Prefecture" and "Lei Wanchun Fights the Tiger" won first prize for performance.

The performances of the China Puppet Art Troupe were warmly praised by the audience. The actors, through their superb skills, brought each puppet character to life. Whether it was martial arts movements or lyrical gestures, they were performed with vivid realism. Sun Wukong's courageous and intelligent battles with the Bull Demon King and Princess Iron Fan, Lei Wanchun's heroic posture in "Lei Wanchun Fights the Tiger," the humorous and skillful performances of the Liangshan heroes in "Daming Prefecture," and the fierce battle between the shrimp soldiers, crab generals, and the Four Heavenly Kings in "The Flood of Jinshan Temple" all captivated the audience and earned applause again and again. Many audience members said, "They really brought the puppets to life!" On one occasion, after the performance of "Sun Wukong Thrice Borrows the Banana Fan," the audience stood up and applauded, and the curtain calls reached eleven times.

After each performance by the China Puppet Art Troupe, many audience members watched both the performance and went backstage. At this time, the backstage became a lively place, with people shaking hands and congratulating the actors, actors from other troupes asking to learn from their experience, news reporters asking to learn about the state of Chinese puppet art, and painters drawing portraits of our actors. Many audience members were very interested in the Chinese puppets' modeling art and praised the beautiful costumes. One Bulgarian actress picked up "Princess Iron Fan" (a character in "Sun Wukong Thrice Borrows the Banana Fan"), examined it carefully, loved it so much that she finally kissed it before putting it down.

The performances of the China Puppet Art Troupe also received good reviews in the Romanian press. A review in "Literary Gazette" wrote: "The actors' superb mastery of complex movements, the flexibility of the characters' expressions, and the characterization through unique actions, such as Sun Wukong's turn of the hand or raise of the foot, all these details are so finely presented that they are surprising. The play 'Sun Wukong' is permeated with a strong vein of folk realism, which permeates every character. Here, beautiful poetry and the fantasy of ancient myths are seamlessly combined with overflowing humor and the wisdom of the people." A review in "Modern Newspaper" also said, "The Chinese puppet theatre actors succinctly portray the clever, resolute, and optimistic experiences of Sun Wukong."

The audience also greatly appreciated the Chinese puppet theatre's sets, music, lighting, and costumes. In the play "Sun Wukong Thrice Borrows the Banana Fan," the Flaming Mountains really looked like raging flames soaring into the sky, and in the play "The Flood of Jinshan Temple," one could see the turbulent waves. A review in "Free Romania Newspaper" said: "The sets are very exquisite, like a silk embroidery, the music is rich in meaning, and the rhythmic drumming punctuates the climax of the conflict, completely in line with the plot of the play." A review in "Modern Newspaper" wrote: "The puppets' faces and costumes, the colorful backgrounds, and the lighting effects all reproduce the unique splendor and magnificence of Chinese fine colored porcelain."

According to general practice, the judges of the theatre festival are unwilling to express their opinions on the performances before the results of the competition are announced, but some judges couldn't help but express their appreciation after watching the performances of the China Puppet Art Troupe. Jan Malik, a famous Czech puppet artist and a judge at this theatre festival, gave our actors several thumbs up and praised, "Excellent, excellent!" The chairman of the judging committee of this theatre festival, the famous Romanian writer M. Breslasu, told reporters: "The performances of the China Puppet Art Troupe have excited me in many aspects, such as technique, sets, and costumes. I think that young European puppet theatre can learn a lot from China."

    “孙悟空”扬名布加勒斯特
    记中国木偶艺术团在第二届国际木偶、傀儡戏剧节的演出
    本报记者　魏凌冰
    一天，在布加勒斯特工会剧院的舞台上，出现了一座有着琼楼玉榭的水下宫殿，鱼鳖虾蟹在明澈无比的深水中遨游。有四条美丽的金鱼游向殿堂，只向水下一沉，就都变成了婷婷玉立的仙女，接着，移动莲步翩翩起舞。这时，剧场内立即响起了热烈的掌声。这是中国木偶艺术团演出“孙悟空三调芭蕉扇”的一个场面。
    从9月15日到30日，在布加勒斯特举行了第二届国际木偶、傀儡戏剧节。在这期间，有苏联、中国、罗马尼亚等二十五个国家的木偶、傀儡剧团参加了这次盛大的演出。另外，还有数百名世界各地的木偶、傀儡剧工作者前来观摩。中国木偶艺术团是第一次参加这样的国际会演。这次共演出了“孙悟空三调芭蕉扇”、“大名府”、“雷万春打虎”、“庆丰收”和“水漫金山”五个节目。我国木偶艺术团荣获这次戏剧节的二等奖（这次比赛未评出大奖，二等奖只有一名。）得银质奖章一枚；“大名府”和“雷万春打虎”两节目获得了表演奖第一名。
    中国木偶艺术团的演出受到了观众的热烈赞扬。演员通过卓越的技巧，使每个木偶角色获得了生命。不论是武打动作还是抒情动作都表演得逼真毕肖。孙悟空与牛魔王及铁扇公主的斗勇斗智，“雷万春打虎”的雄姿，“大名府”一剧中梁山泊好汉饶有风趣的绝技表演，“水漫金山”一剧中虾兵蟹将同四大金刚的鏖战都紧紧吸引着观众的注意，博得了一次又一次的掌声。许多观众都说：“真把木偶演活了！”有一次，在“孙悟空三调芭蕉扇”演毕时，观众起立鼓掌，谢幕达十一次。
    在中国木偶艺术团每场演毕后，有不少观众是看完前台又看后台。这时，后台就成了热闹的场地，人们纷纷向演员们握手祝贺，其他剧团的演员要求介绍经验，新闻记者要求介绍中国木偶艺术的情况，画家给我们的演员画像。许多观众都对中国木偶的造型艺术很感兴趣，对漂亮的服饰赞不绝口。有一位保加利亚的女演员把“铁扇公主”（“孙悟空三调芭蕉扇”中的角色）拿起来，端详再三，爱不释手，最后和它接了一个吻才放下。
    中国木偶艺术团的演出也得到罗马尼亚报刊的好评。“文学报”的一篇评论写道：“演员的高超技术对复杂动作的掌握，人物表情的灵活性，通过独到动作所表现的人物性格，如孙悟空的一翻手、一抬足，这一切如此细腻地表现细节的地方都使人感到惊奇。孙悟空这出戏贯穿着强烈的民间现实主义的脉息，这脉息浸透在每个人物身上。在这里，美妙的诗意和古代神话的幻想是与洋溢的幽默和人民的智慧天衣无缝地结合在一起的。”“现代报”的评论也说，“中国木偶剧演员精炼地表现了聪明、刚毅和乐观的孙悟空的遭遇。”
    观众对中国木偶剧的布景、音乐、灯光和服饰也非常赞赏。在“孙悟空三调芭蕉扇”一剧中，那火焰山真像腾腾烈焰直冲云霄，在“水漫金山”一剧中又可以看到波浪滔滔的景象。“自由罗马尼亚报”的评论说：“布景是非常精致的，像一幅丝绣，音乐含意丰富，有节奏的鼓点，点破着冲突的最高峰，完全与戏剧的情节相吻合。”“现代报”的评论写道：“木偶的脸型和服饰，彩色的背景，灯光效果都重现了中国特细彩瓷所独有的辉煌富丽。”
    按照一般惯例，戏剧节的评判委员在比赛结果没有公布前，是不愿对演出表示自己的意见的，但有些评判委员在看了中国木偶艺术团的演出后，情不自禁地表示赞赏。捷克斯洛伐克著名木偶艺术家、这次戏剧节的评委杨·马利克就几次竖起大拇指向我演员称赞：“妙极了，妙极了！”这次戏剧节的评判委员会主席、罗著名作家马·勃列斯拉舒向记者说：“中国木偶艺术团的演出在技巧、布景、服饰等许多方面都使我感到兴奋。我认为，年青的欧洲木偶剧可以从中国学到很多东西。”
