Xinhua News Agency, 7th. German Democratic Republic Ambassador to China, Wang Dael, held a grand reception at the Beijing Hotel tonight to warmly celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.

Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Chairman Zhu De, and Premier Zhou Enlai attended the reception.

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen spoke at the reception. On behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people, he extended warm congratulations to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Government of the German Democratic Republic, and the people. He emphasized that the Chinese government and the Chinese people firmly support the people of the German Democratic Republic in their struggle against West German militarism, support the efforts of the people of the German Democratic Republic to achieve the reunification of their motherland on a peaceful and democratic basis, and support the solemn position of the Government of the German Democratic Republic in opposing West Germany's attempt to regard West Berlin as West German territory.

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen said that under the guidance of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Government of the German Democratic Republic, the people of the Democratic Republic have made great achievements in socialist construction. In the first half of this year, the total industrial output value of the German Democratic Republic increased by 10% compared with the same period last year, and the labor productivity of state-owned industries increased by 9%. Furthermore, agricultural cooperation has been achieved nationwide. With the continuous growth of industrial and agricultural production, the cultural and scientific undertakings of the German Democratic Republic have been further developed. All of this has laid a good foundation for the successful completion of the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy. The Chinese people are sincerely pleased with these achievements made by the people of the German Democratic Republic and wish the people of the German Democratic Republic greater achievements in the future.

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen said that the German Democratic Republic has consistently pursued a foreign policy of peace and has made unremitting efforts in the struggle against US imperialism's revival of West German militarism and in safeguarding European and world peace. Recently, the General Staff of the West German Defense Forces issued a memorandum approved by West German Chancellor Adenauer, openly proposing to implement universal conscription and equip the West German army with atomic weapons. This crazy war preparation action by West German militarism poses a serious threat to the peace of Europe and the world, and deserves the high vigilance of peace-loving people all over the world.

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen said that since the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, the fraternal friendship between our two peoples has been enhanced on a new basis, and the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries in the fields of politics, economy, culture, and science have been continuously strengthened and developed. In the common cause of building socialism and opposing imperialism, our two countries always help and support each other.

The Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude to the people of the German Democratic Republic for their help and support to our country. The Chinese people cherish the friendly unity with the people of the German Democratic Republic. The friendly unity between our two peoples and the friendly unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union are based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism and are unbreakable. The imperialists and modern revisionists are keen on undermining the unity of the socialist camp, which is completely futile. The Chinese people will always stand together with the people of the German Democratic Republic, together with the people of all socialist countries, and fight to the end against imperialist aggression, for the defense of world peace, and for the development of the cause of socialist and communist construction.

Ambassador Wang Dael spoke at the beginning of the reception. He said that the working people of the German Democratic Republic, together with many friends all over the world, are reviewing the inspiring and brilliant achievements made in socialist construction and the struggle for peace. We should especially point out that a particularly important event politically and economically is that all the farmers in our country have embarked on the road of socialism. The German Democratic Republic stands firmly as a bulwark of social progress, of the national struggle of all the German people against militarism and imperialism for peace and thus for the peaceful restoration of the unity of the German nation as the only possible way. Despite the hopeless conspiracies pursued by West German militarists and imperialists, the international prestige of the German Democratic Republic has been enhanced.

The ambassador said that the German Democratic Republic maintains a high degree of vigilance against the dark forces of US imperialism and the dangerous West German imperialist war criminals of the past and present who collude with it, and takes all necessary measures to develop socialist construction and make the greatest contribution to the cause of safeguarding peace.

The ambassador said that the Government of the German Democratic Republic has consistently pursued a policy of peaceful coexistence. In order to support the Soviet Union's firm policy of peace and the outstanding representative of the Soviet Union, Comrade Khrushchev, we have submitted a "Memorandum on Disarmament in Germany" to the Plenary Session of the United Nations General Assembly, which is currently being held and is of great significance, as our constructive contribution to the decisive task in world politics - complete and thorough disarmament. The memorandum begins by recommending that the two Germanys issue a declaration valid under international law, stating that they will not use force against each other or against other countries. Its three-stage disarmament plan includes all aspects, from stopping the arms race and solemnly declaring the renunciation of atomic weapons to the universal and complete disarmament of the two Germanys. The well-known proposal to conclude a peace treaty and the proposal to transform West Berlin from a hotbed of the Cold War into a demilitarized free city are inextricably linked to all this.

The ambassador said that we are convinced that this new initiative of the Government of the German Democratic Republic in the struggle for peace, like all the struggles it has waged in the past, will receive the full and firm support of the Chinese people, our great brothers.

He said that the German Democratic Republic, through its appointed representatives, has repeatedly expressed the will of our state of workers and peasants to firmly support the peaceful policies of the Chinese people and its just demands. The German Democratic Republic welcomes the valuable proposal of the Government of the People's Republic of China on the conclusion of a treaty of non-aggression and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia and the Pacific region.

He said that we congratulate our Chinese friends on the achievements they have made in implementing the policy of peaceful coexistence in Asia and Africa, and especially congratulate the recent signing of the border treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma, which is of significance to the whole world.

The ambassador said that the German Democratic Republic firmly supports the Chinese people's struggle to liberate their territory of Taiwan from the occupation of US imperialism and condemns the policy of creating "two Chinas" through provocative conspiracies, and the vicious attempt to legalize the US imperialist occupation of Taiwan and make it permanent.

The ambassador said that the German Democratic Republic, together with all peace-loving peoples of all countries, demands the restoration of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and demands an end to the shameful state created by US imperialism and its followers, which, in the words of Comrade Khrushchev, is "detrimental to world peace and disgraceful to the United Nations." The German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China have maintained close and ever-growing friendship since their establishment. Economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries is developing year by year. The People's Republic of China has provided valuable assistance to the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic. As a monument to the friendship between our two countries in the People's Republic of China, the Baoding Rayon Factory, the Xi'an Instrument Factory, the Zhengzhou Grinding Wheel Factory, and the Yakshi Forest Products Processing Factory have been put into operation this year alone through the joint labor of the working people of our two countries. The ambassador said that a series of common documents of our two governments show that our two countries are members of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is the solid foundation of our friendship.

The speeches of Ambassador Wang Dael and Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen were warmly welcomed. After their speeches, the band played the national anthems of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic respectively.

The reception proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere. The hosts and guests repeatedly toasted to the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and German peoples, to the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet union , for world peace, for the health of Comrade Ulbricht and Comrade Mao Zedong and other leaders of the two countries.

Also present at the reception were Vice Chairmen Shen Junru, Chen Shutong, and Cheng Qian, Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun, President Xie Juezai, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Fu Zuoyi, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Bao Erhan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and other responsible persons from various departments of state organs, various democratic parties, various people's organizations, and Beijing Municipality, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

Envoys and diplomatic officials of various countries stationed in China were also invited to attend the reception.

    聂荣臻副总理在德驻华大使举行的国庆招待会上说
    中国支持德意志民主共和国人民
    反对美帝国主义复活西德军国主义
    董副主席、朱委员长、周总理出席了招待会
    新华社7日讯　德意志民主共和国驻中国大使汪戴尔今天晚间在北京饭店举行盛大招待会，热烈庆祝德意志民主共和国成立十一周年。
    董必武副主席、朱德委员长和周恩来总理出席了招待会。
    聂荣臻副总理在招待会上讲话。他代表中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向德国统一社会党、德意志民主共和国政府和人民致以热烈的祝贺。他强调指出：中国政府和中国人民坚决支持德意志民主共和国人民反对西德军国主义的斗争，支持德意志民主共和国人民为争取在和平民主的基础上统一祖国而进行的努力，支持德意志民主共和国政府反对西德妄图把西柏林视为西德领土的严正立场。
    聂荣臻副总理说，德意志民主共和国人民在德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府的领导下，在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就。今年上半年，德意志民主共和国的工业总产值比去年同期增加了10％，国营工业的劳动生产率提高了9％。并且在全国实现了农业合作化。随着工农业生产的不断增长，德意志民主共和国的文化、科学事业有了进一步的发展。所有这一切，都为胜利完成发展国民经济的七年计划奠定了良好的基础。中国人民对于德意志民主共和国人民所取得的这些成就感到衷心的高兴并且预祝德意志民主共和国人民今后将取得更大的成就。
    聂荣臻副总理说，德意志民主共和国一贯奉行和平的外交政策，在反对美帝国主义复活西德军国主义、维护欧洲和世界和平的斗争中进行了坚持不懈的努力。最近西德国防军总参谋部发表了一份为西德总理阿登纳所批准的备忘录，明目张胆地提出要实行普遍义务兵役制和用原子武器装备西德军队。西德军国主义这种疯狂的备战行动，对欧洲和世界的和平造成了严重的威胁，值得引起全世界爱好和平的人民的高度警惕。
    聂荣臻副总理说，在中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国成立以来，我们两国人民的兄弟友谊在新的基础上得到了增进，两国之间在政治、经济、文化、科学等方面的友好合作关系不断地巩固和发展。在建设社会主义和反对帝国主义的共同事业中，我们两国一向互相帮助和互相支持。
    中国人民对德意志民主共和国人民所给予我国的帮助和支持表示衷心的感谢。中国人民十分珍视同德意志民主共和国人民的友好团结。我们两国人民的友好团结和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的友好团结，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的原则之上的，是牢不可破的。帝国主义和现代修正主义热中于破坏社会主义阵营各国的团结，完全是徒劳的。中国人民将永远同德意志民主共和国人民一起，同所有社会主义国家人民一起，为反对帝国主义侵略、维护世界和平、促进社会主义和共产主义建设事业的发展而斗争到底。
    汪戴尔大使在招待会开始的时候讲话。他说，德意志民主共和国的劳动人民同布满全世界的许多朋友一起检阅在社会主义建设和争取和平的斗争中所取得的令人振奋的光辉成就。我们应该特别指出，一件政治上和经济上特别重要的事件，那就是我国的农民全部都走上了社会主义的道路。德意志民主共和国作为社会进步、全体德国人民反对军国主义和帝国主义而争取和平的民族斗争从而争取德意志民族的和平恢复统一的唯一可能道路的堡垒坚定不移的屹立着。尽管西德军国主义者和帝国主义者推行着毫无希望的阴谋，德意志民主共和国的国际威信仍然提高了。
    大使说，德意志民主共和国对美帝国主义黑暗势力以及和它相勾结的危险的西德过去和现在的帝国主义战犯保持着高度的警惕，采取一切必要的措施来发展社会主义建设和对保障和平的事业作出最大的贡献。
    大使说，德意志民主共和国政府一贯奉行和平共处的政策。为了支持苏联坚定的和平政策和苏联的卓越代表赫鲁晓夫同志，我们向正在召开的意义重大的联合国大会全体会议提出了一份“关于在德国进行裁军的备忘录”作为我们对世界政治中的决定性的任务——全面彻底裁军——的建设性贡献。备忘录一开始就建议两个德国发表一项在国际法上有效的声明。相互之间和对其它国家不使用武力。它的分三个阶段裁军的计划包括了以停止扩军，庄严宣布放弃原子武器直到两个德国普遍和全面裁军等各方面。众所周知的缔结和约的建议和把西柏林从一个冷战的温床变成一个非军事化的自由城市的建议与这一切不可分割地联结在一起。
    大使说，我们确信，德意志民主共和国政府在争取和平斗争中的这种新的积极性和它从前所进行的所有斗争同样会得到我们伟大的兄弟的中国人民全面和坚决的支持。
    他说，德意志民主共和国通过它所任命的代表一再地表示了我们工农国家坚决支持中国人民的和平政策和它的正义要求的意志。德意志民主共和国欢迎中华人民共和国政府关于缔结互不侵犯条约和在亚洲和太平洋地区建立无原子武器区的宝贵建议。
    他说，我们祝贺我们的中国朋友在亚洲和非洲贯彻和平共处的政策时所取得的成就，特别祝贺最近中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦所签订的对全世界具有意义的边界条约。
    大使说，德意志民主共和国坚决支持中国人民从美帝国主义的占领下解放自己的领土台湾的斗争，并谴责通过挑拨性的阴谋诡计而制造“两个中国”的政策，而使美帝国主义对台湾的霸占合法化并使其永远存在下去的恶毒企图。
    大使说，德意志民主共和国和所有爱好和平的各国人民一起要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位。要求结束美帝国主义和它的追随者所制造可耻的状态，这种状态用赫鲁晓夫同志的话来说就是：“对世界和平不利和对联合国不光彩”。德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国从成立以来一直存在着亲密的不断发展着的友谊。我们两国之间的经济和文化合作年复一年地发展着。中华人民共和国给德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设提供了宝贵的援助。作为我们两国在中华人民共和国的友谊纪念碑，仅仅在今年一年通过我们两国劳动人民的共同劳动，就有保定人造丝厂，西安仪表厂，郑州沙轮厂和牙克石的林产加工厂开工。大使说，我们两国的政府一系列的共同文件表明，我们两国都是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的成员，这是我们之间友谊的牢固基础。
    汪戴尔大使和聂荣臻副总理的讲话，受到了热烈欢迎。在他们讲话以后，乐队分别奏中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的国歌。
    招待会在热烈和友好的气氛中进行。宾主一再为中德两国人民之间兄弟般的友谊，为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，为世界和平，为乌布利希同志和毛泽东同志以及两国其他领导同志的健康，干杯。
    出席招待会的还有，沈钧儒、陈叔通、程潜副委员长，习仲勋副总理，谢觉哉院长，国防委员会副主席傅作义，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，外交部副部长章汉夫等，以及国家机关各部门、各民主党派、各人民团体和北京市的负责人，中国人民解放军的高级将领，首都各方面的人士。
    各国驻中国的使节和外交官员也应邀出席了招待会。
