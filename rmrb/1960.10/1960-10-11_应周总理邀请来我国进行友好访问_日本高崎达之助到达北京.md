    At Premier Zhou's Invitation for a Friendly Visit to China
    Mr. Tatsunosuke Takasaki Arrives in Beijing
    Xinhua News Agency, October 10th. At the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai, Mr. Tatsunosuke Takasaki, former Minister of International Trade and Industry of Japan, and his entourage of fourteen people arrived in Beijing by plane this afternoon for a friendly visit to China.
    At Beijing Airport, Mr. Tatsunosuke Takasaki made the following statement:
    "We have come to Beijing at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai. The People's Republic of China celebrated the 11th anniversary of its founding on October 1st. I have always wanted to see with my own eyes the construction achievements and the great leap forward in all aspects that China has achieved since its founding. Thanks to Premier Zhou's kindness, I am able to realize my long-cherished wish, which makes me feel extremely gratified.
    In 1955, I participated in the Bandung Conference as a representative of the Japanese government. At that time, I frankly exchanged views with Premier Zhou Enlai, who also attended the conference as a representative of the Chinese government. The impression at that time seems like yesterday, and it is clearly reappearing in my memory.
    I am convinced that only by following the resolutions adopted in Bandung and its spirit can we establish an unshakable world peace.
    Fifteen years ago, the Japanese people stood up again as a democratic nation from the ruins of defeat in the war. The Japanese people deeply reflect on the past erroneous policies that caused great trouble to China, and sincerely hope to form a peaceful international environment.
    Fifteen years have passed since the end of the Pacific War. However, the relationship between China and Japan is still in an unnatural state, and I feel very regretful about this.
    However, there is a history of two thousand years of exchanges between China and Japan.
    Currently, the most important thing for Sino-Japanese relations is to restore the mutual trust between China and Japan that has been lost from the last war to the post-war period as soon as possible. Because without mutual trust, and covered by the clouds of suspicion and misunderstanding, we cannot establish a good-neighborly and friendly relationship.
    Therefore, the urgent task is to have heart-to-heart talks with each other in a humble manner.
    In this sense, I hope to have in-depth conversations with Premier Zhou and relevant people during my stay in your country.
    The people who are traveling with me this time are all experts in various aspects of Japan's important industries. I think it is helpful for the economic development of the two countries, and it is also in line with the spirit of good-neighborly friendship and mutual benefit confirmed at the Bandung Conference to exchange frank opinions and learn from each other between these experts and the experts from your country who are promoting the great leap forward.
    As mentioned above, we are visiting your country this time because we have had the long-standing desire to improve Sino-Japanese relations.
    I believe that the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations will make a significant contribution to the peace and prosperity of Asia and world peace. I sincerely thank you all for your welcome.”
    Tong Xiaopeng, Director of the Premier's Office of the State Council, welcomed him at the airport.
    Also present at the airport to welcome him were Zhang Xiruo, Li Dequan, Cai Tingkai, Chu Tunan, Xu Guangping, Ji Chao Ding, Wu Maosun, Xie Nanguang, Zhao Anbo, Xin Yi, Yang Zheng, Yang Chunsong and other people from all walks of life in the capital.
    Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji and his wife, who are in Beijing, also went to the airport to welcome him.
    Xiao Xiangqian, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, who went to Shenzhen to meet Tatsunosuke Takasaki, also arrived in Beijing on the same plane.

    应周总理邀请来我国进行友好访问
    日本高崎达之助到达北京
    新华社10日讯　应周恩来总理邀请，前来我国进行友好访问的日本前通商产业相高崎达之助和随行人员一行十四人，今天下午乘飞机到达北京。
    高崎达之助在北京机场发表了如下的谈话：
    “我们应周恩来总理的邀请，现在来到了北京。中华人民共和国在10月1日，迎接了建国十一周年纪念日。我一向切望亲眼看到中国建国以来所取得的建设成就，和各方面大跃进的情况。这次由于周总理的厚意，能够实现多年来的愿望，使我感到最大的欣慰。
    我在1955年做为日本政府代表参加了万隆会议。当时，我和同样的代表中国政府而参加会议的周恩来总理，曾经坦率地交换了意见。当时的印象好像昨天的事情一样，很清楚地重新浮现在我记忆里。
    我确信只有遵照在万隆所采纳的决议和其精神，才能树立坚如磐石的世界和平。
    日本人民在十五年前，在战败的废墟中，重新做为民主国家而站起来了。日本人民深刻地反省曾给中国很大麻烦的过去错误的政策，而衷心希望形成和平的国际环境。
    自从太平洋战争结束以来，已经过了十五年。但是中日两国的关系，仍然处在不自然的状态，对此，我感到非常的遗憾。
    但是中日之间，有两千年往来的历史。
    目前对于中日关系，最要紧的是，尽早恢复从上次战争到战后期间，所失掉的中日双方的相互信任。因为如果没有相互信任，而被猜疑和误会的乌云所遮盖，就不能树立善邻友好的关系。
    为此，当务之急是，彼此以虚心的态度，推心置腹地进行会谈的事。
    从这个意义上，我希望在贵国逗留期间，将同周总理和有关方面的人士，促膝交谈。
    这次和我同行的人们，都是日本重要工业的各方面的专家。我想这些专家和推进贵国大跃进的贵国各方面的专家，交换坦率的意见，相互学习，是有助于两国的经济发展的，同时也符合于在万隆会议所确认的善邻友好和互惠的精神。
    如上所说，我们这次访问贵国，是因为我们多年来怀有改善中日关系的愿望而来的。
    我相信中日关系的改善，将为亚洲的和平和繁荣以及世界和平做出不少的贡献。我衷心感谢各位的欢迎。”
    国务院总理办公室主任童小鹏到机场欢迎。
    到机场欢迎的还有张奚若、李德全、蔡廷锴、楚图南、许广平、冀朝鼎、吴茂荪、谢南光、赵安博、辛毅、杨正和杨春松等首都各界人士。
    在京的日本和平人士西园寺公一和夫人也到机场欢迎。
    前往深圳迎接高崎达之助的中国人民外交学会副秘书长萧向前也同机到达北京。
