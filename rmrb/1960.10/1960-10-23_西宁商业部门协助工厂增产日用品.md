    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 22nd—The local industrial products store of the Xining City Commercial Bureau in Qinghai Province is vigorously assisting local industries in producing daily-use commodities to supply both urban and rural people.

    In organizing local industrial production, this store has adopted "three grasps" (grasping large and small factories together, grasping indigenous and modern production together, grasping large and small products together), "two guarantees" (guaranteeing to sell whatever is produced, guaranteeing to sell however much is produced), and "one support" (supporting with raw materials) and other measures, so that the variety and quantity of daily-use industrial products have continuously increased. Since the beginning of this year, they have supplied various daily-use product factories with more than 140 kinds of raw materials, totaling more than 13 million yuan in value, ensuring the normal production of the factories.

    In order to assist factories in increasing the variety of daily-use products and improve product quality, this store has transferred experienced veteran workers familiar with technology to work in the factories, providing guidance and assistance. It has also organized technicians from various factories to visit advanced factories both inside and outside the province. At the same time, it collects samples, patterns, and advanced tailoring methods of shoes, hats, clothing, and other commodities from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places to provide local factories with reference.

    西宁商业部门协助工厂增产日用品
    据新华社西宁22日电　青海省西宁市商业局地方工业产品门市部，大力协助地方工业生产日用商品，供应城乡人民。
    在组织地方工业生产中，这个门市部采取了“三抓”（大小工厂一起抓、土洋生产一起抓、大小产品一起抓），“二包”（生产什么包销什么、生产多少包销多少），“一支援”（支援原料）等措施，使日用工业品的品种、数量都不断上升。今年来，他们供应了各日用品工厂一百四十多种原料，总值一千三百多万元，保证了工厂的正常生产。
    为了协助工厂增加日用品品种，提高产品质量，这个门市部抽调熟谙技术的老职工驻厂办公，予以指导帮助，组织各厂的技术人员到省内外先进工厂参观，同时从北京、上海、天津等地收集鞋帽、服装等商品的样品、样版、先进剪裁方法等提供当地工厂参考。
