    Comrade Abdyl Këllezi, Member of the Central Committee, Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Albanian Labor Party, and Chairman of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association, delivered a speech at the mass rally in the capital welcoming the delegation of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association. The full text is as follows:
    Dear Comrade Jiang Nanxiang, dear Comrades Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, dear Chinese comrades and friends:
    On the occasion of the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Albanian people and the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association have sent us to your beautiful country to extend our best and warmest revolutionary congratulations to the heroic and fraternal Chinese people.
    We are very happy to be able to speak to you at this mass rally organized by the Sino-Albanian Friendship Association. As soon as we set foot on the land of People's China, we were surrounded by the boundless love of the representatives of your Party and government, Comrades Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, the leaders of the Sino-Albanian Friendship Association headed by Comrade Jiang Nanxiang, and the representatives of the people and youth of Beijing. They heartily cheered the unbreakable friendship between our two peoples. This friendship is deeply rooted because it is built on the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. The friendship between the 650 million Chinese people and the 1.6 million Albanian people is noble and eternal, because it was forged by the glorious Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Hoxha and the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.
    The Albanian people infinitely love the heroic fraternal Chinese people, infinitely love the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its outstanding leader, the long-tested Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong. It has only been eleven years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. This is a very short time for a country, but in these eleven years, People's China has undergone amazing changes. China, once an oppressed and backward country with millions of unemployed and living in poverty, has now become a country shining with the great light of socialism, a huge construction site where everything is for the welfare of the working people and their happier lives.
    In your country, in the new socialist China, great changes can be seen everywhere, whether from east to west or from south to north. The speed of development of your industrial and agricultural production is amazing. The enemy hates your speed. The completion of the Five-Year Plan in two years, the further development of industry and agriculture, and the huge and high-speed construction of various economic and cultural sectors themselves demonstrate the achievements made in this short period. The long-term plans formulated by your wise command—the Chinese Communist Party—show that even more amazing and rapid changes will take place in socialist China.
    Your Albanian comrades, the Albanian people and their Labor Party, watch these achievements with admiration. All friends of China in the world are cheered by these achievements. Only the imperialists headed by the United States—the gendarme of world imperialism—and the modern revisionists represented by the Belgrade revisionist traitors slander your country. They attempt to bury these achievements because they fear this huge development, and fear that the oppressed people in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the whole world will find support and inspiration in this development.
    But, as the saying goes: Bad dogs bark as they follow, but the caravan moves on.
    Dear Chinese comrades, what are the reasons for your achievements? The reason for these achievements is the immortal thought of Marxism-Leninism that the glorious Chinese Communist Party uses to temper itself, and the consistently correct political, ideological and economic line of the Chinese Communist Party under the wise and steady leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong. The Chinese Communist Party has carried out more than twenty-eight years of glorious revolutionary struggle. It was tempered in the long-term revolutionary struggle and resolutely defended the purity of Marxism-Leninism. For this reason, it has won the support of all the people, and together with the people, it carried out the great people's revolution. After the great October Socialist Revolution, this revolution is the second most important event of the twentieth century.
    While faithfully implementing the principles of Marxism-Leninism, the Chinese Communist Party is building a new life—socialism—based on China's specific conditions. China has rapidly become a powerful socialist country, and a strong pillar for maintaining the unity of the socialist camp and the world communist and workers' movement. We are infinitely heartened by the achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and we regard these achievements as our own achievements, and as the achievements of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    Dear comrades: During our stay here, we participated in the parade of the working people of Beijing in front of Tiananmen Square. The enthusiastic passing of the working people in front of the leaders of the Party and government headed by Comrade Mao Zedong showed how strong their connection with the Party and government is. At the same time, we also contacted the outstanding workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, which has turned into a huge industrial base in a very short time and is becoming a powerful joint enterprise at an even faster pace. We visited huge projects such as the Great Hall of the People and the Beijing Railway Station. The fact that the talented Chinese workers, engineers, and technicians designed and built these projects shows the great talent and strength of the talented Chinese people. We have been warmly welcomed everywhere. This welcome expresses the love of the fraternal Chinese people for the Albanian people, the Party and the government. We met very affectionately with your glorious leaders—Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Comrade Zhu De, Comrade Zhou Enlai and other leading comrades, and conveyed to them the best and most heartfelt congratulations of our country's leaders, especially Comrade Hoxha.
    Once again, we saw the flesh-and-blood connection between the Chinese people and the Party. We are infinitely pleased to see that the workers, peasants, intellectuals, young men and women, and all the working people are implementing the instructions of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong with soaring enthusiasm, and they have become the glorious builders of socialism and communism. This shows how correct the line of your Party and government is. In fact, you have always been advancing along the correct Marxist-Leninist line pointed out by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and these huge achievements you have made cannot be erased by anyone. China has eliminated the unbearable phenomenon of unemployment, eliminated the system of exploitation of man by man, and is developing rapidly in industry, agriculture, culture, education and science. These facts cannot be erased in any way. Compared with the same period last year, production at the end of August this year increased by about 40% for steel, about 40% for iron, 25% for coal, 45% for electricity, and 1.2 times for chemical fertilizers, etc. These facts are undeniable. Great results have been achieved in agricultural development and the establishment of people's communes in recent years. The peasants of the Chinese people's communes are waging a tenacious struggle to overcome the difficulties caused by natural disasters such as drought and flood and to expand irrigation.
    These achievements show that you have laid the foundation for achieving greater achievements in the future. All this makes us infinitely happy. This is a great achievement for the entire socialist camp.
    Dear comrades, the situation in Albania is also like that in your dear China. Albania, which used to be backward, has entered the ranks of advanced countries. In the fifteen years since liberation, industrial production has increased twenty-one and a half times, and agricultural production has also increased compared with the pre-war period. The cultivated area has increased, and water conservancy and irrigation have been expanded. Now, one in every five people is studying in schools or training classes. Our country, where 85% of the people were illiterate in the past, is now able to train hundreds of thousands of engineers, agronomists, economists, doctors and teachers who serve the people every year. We are developing important economic sectors, such as oil extraction and processing, and the mining of minerals such as chromium, nickel, coal, and asphalt. The industry that produces consumer goods has also developed greatly.
    Agriculture has been almost entirely collectivized, and the superiority of the agricultural cooperative system over individually-run agriculture has now become apparent.
    Culture, art and science have become the wealth of the working masses. The cultural and material level of the working masses in our country is constantly improving year by year.
    The unity between the Albanian people and the Party and the government, and the unity with our leader Comrade Hoxha, is as solid as steel. No force in the world can destroy this unity, because the Labor Party headed by Comrade Hoxha has tempered this unity in the glorious national liberation struggle it led, and in the rapidly advancing socialist construction today.
    What is the source of these achievements? The source of these achievements is the immortal thought of Marxism-Leninism, our glorious Labor Party headed by the founder of the Party, the Marxist-Leninist Comrade Hoxha. Our Party has always implemented its correct Marxist-Leninist line throughout its entire revolutionary course. The Party has never wavered and will never waver in its Marxist-Leninist position. Our enemies—the imperialists and their agents, the Yugoslav revisionists—have tried every means to undermine the connection between our Party and the people, to use slander and defamation, the hostile activities of Party traitors, sabotage and the dispatch of special agents, and the imposition of pressure to divide our Party. However, they have always failed and will continue to fail. Our Party and the people have always been the victors. Our Party and the people, like your Party and the people, are melted together. They are forging ahead to build socialism. In addition, we have obtained these great achievements because of the generous and internationalist assistance given by our friends—the Soviet Union, People's China, and all other countries of the socialist camp. On this occasion, we would like to express our gratitude to the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party for the huge and internationalist assistance they have given to the Albanian people.
    We are moving forward, and we are fully confident that our political, ideological, and economic line is correct, because our line is based on Marxist-Leninist thought. Marxism-Leninism has been and will always be the guide of our Labor Party.
    An unbreakable friendship connects the peoples of Albania and China. This friendship is profound, and it has been forged over a long period by our two Parties, Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong. We are glad that friendly associations have been established in both our countries—the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association in Albania and the Chinese-Albanian Friendship Association in China. Our Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association, like yours, has done a good job in strengthening the friendship between our two peoples and in publicizing the achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people in all aspects. The Albanian people draw new strength from your achievements and redouble their efforts to complete their tasks. We are pleased to see that your Chinese-Albanian Friendship Association is also carrying out the same work. Both you and we are carrying out valuable work that helps to strengthen our new type of relations, which are built on the immortal thought of Marxism-Leninism.
    Comrades, please allow me, from the podium of this mass rally, to express the boundless love of the Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party for the great China, the heroic and talented Chinese people, the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong.
    We and you are members of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. We and you cherish the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and fight for it. We and you fight for the purity of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, we and you fight for peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems, we and you now and in the future will defend peace vigilantly, defend the gains we have made, and expose the warmongers of imperialism headed by the United States. We and you now and in the future oppose modern revisionism, especially Yugoslav revisionism, which is an agent of imperialism. Because, as the 1957 Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties pointed out, revisionism is the main danger in the current world communist and workers' movement.
    The government of the People's Republic of Albania and the government of the People's Republic of China have in the past and now support the Soviet Union's position of striving to defend peace, disarmament, banning nuclear weapons and peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems.
    The Albanian people and their government believe that the position of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States against the People's Republic of China joining the United Nations Organization is unforgivable, and condemn this position. The traitor Chiang Kai-shek, who does not represent the Chinese people at all, should get out of the United Nations Organization. People's China should take its rightful seat, because no international issue can be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China, with its consistent peaceful policy, has become an important factor in defending world peace and security. The fact that the government of the People's Republic of China has signed treaties of non-aggression and friendship with many Asian and African countries is new proof of the peaceful policy of the People's Republic of China.
    We strongly condemn the American imperialists for occupying Taiwan, and we believe that Taiwan will definitely return to the embrace of its motherland.
    The Albanian people and the Albanian communists are preparing to greet the upcoming Fourth Congress of the Party and the sixteenth anniversary of our liberation. At the congress, the magnificent achievements made under the correct leadership of the Party headed by Comrade Hoxha will be summarized. The Fourth Congress will adopt the third Five-Year Plan for 1961-1965. This Five-Year Plan will open up even more brilliant prospects for our socialist construction, and we will embark on the road of transforming our country from an agricultural-industrial country into an industrial-agricultural country. People's lives will be improved. We are full of confidence in the happy future of our people, and our Party and the people will work together with their tireless labor to build this future.
    In the struggle to complete the task, we will have to do arduous work. Under the leadership of our Party, with the help of our friends, we will overcome all the difficulties we face.
    We are walking a common road—the road of building socialism and communism. In order to achieve success on this road, we need the sincere, strong and internationalist friendship between socialist countries. We are pleased to see that Albanian-Chinese friendship is growing stronger day by day, because this friendship now and in the future serves our common goals.
    Dear Chinese comrades, brothers, please allow me to shout at the end of my speech for the unbreakable friendship between Albania and China.
    Long live the heroic and fraternal Chinese people!
    Long live the Marxist-Leninist Parties of our two countries headed by Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong!
    Long live the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live world peace!

    在首都各界人民的欢迎大会上
    凯莱齐副主席的讲话
    新华社4日讯　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、部长会议副主席、阿中友协主席阿卜杜勒·凯莱齐，在首都各界欢迎阿中友协代表团的群众大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的蒋南翔同志，亲爱的李富春、李先念同志，亲爱的中国同志们，朋友们：
    在中华人民共和国成立十一周年的时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民，阿中友好协会派遣我们来到你们美好的国家，来向英雄的兄弟中国人民致以最良好的，最热烈的革命的祝贺。
    我们能够在中阿友好协会组织的这次群众大会上，向大家讲话，感到非常高兴。当我们一踏上人民中国的土地时，就被你们党和政府的代表李富春、李先念等同志和以蒋南翔同志为首的中阿友好协会的领导人以及北京市人民和青年代表的无限热爱包围住了。他们衷心地欢呼我们两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊。这一友谊是根深蒂固的，因为它是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义不朽原则的基础之上的。六亿五千万中国人民和一百六十万阿尔巴尼亚人民之间的友谊是崇高的和永恒的，因为它是以霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党所锤炼起来的。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民无限热爱英雄的兄弟中国人民，无限热爱光荣的中国共产党及其卓越的领袖、久经考验的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志。从中华人民共和国的成立到现在只有十一年，对于一个国家来说，这是一个非常短暂的时间，可是就是在这十一年内，人民中国发生了惊人的变革。中国过去是一个受压迫、千百万人失业和朝不保夕的落后国家，现在已变成了一个闪灼着伟大的社会主义光芒的国家，变成了一个巨大的建筑工地，这个工地上的一切都是为了劳动人民的福利，为了他们更幸福的生活。
    在你们的国家，在社会主义的新中国，不管是从东到西，还是从南到北，到处都可以看到巨大的变化。你们工农业生产的发展速度是令人吃惊的。敌人就是仇恨你们的速度。五年计划两年完成，工农业的进一步发展，经济和文化各部门的巨大的、高速度的建设本身，就说明了在这一短短时期内所取得的成就。你们的英明的指挥部——中国共产党所制订的远景计划，说明在社会主义的中国将发生更加惊人和飞速的变化。
    你们的阿尔巴尼亚同志，阿尔巴尼亚人民及其劳动党以敬佩的心情注视着这些成就。中国在全世界的一切朋友都为这些成就感到欢欣鼓舞，只有以美国——世界帝国主义的宪兵——为首的帝国主义，以贝尔格莱德修正主义叛徒为代表的现代修正主义者才诬蔑你们国家。他们企图埋没这些成就，因为他们害怕这种巨大的发展，害怕亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲以及全世界受压迫的人民在这种发展中找到支持和鼓舞。
    但是，俗话说得好：恶犬跟踪狂吠，商队继续前进。
    亲爱的中国同志们，你们取得这些成就的原因是什么呢？取得这些成就的原因就是光荣的中国共产党用以锻炼了自己的马克思列宁主义的不朽思想，就是在毛泽东同志英明而稳健的领导下的中国共产党的一贯正确的政治、思想和经济路线。中国共产党人进行了二十八年多的光荣的革命斗争，中国共产党是在长期的革命斗争中锻炼出来的，并坚决地保卫着马克思列宁主义的纯洁性。正因如此，它得到了全体人民的支持，并和人民一起进行了伟大的人民革命。在伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，这一革命是二十世纪第二个最重大的事件。
    在忠实执行马克思列宁主义原则的同时，中国共产党根据中国的具体情况，正在建设着新的生活——社会主义。中国已迅速地成为一个强大的社会主义国家，成为一个维护社会主义阵营和世界共产主义和工人运动的团结的强大支柱。我们为兄弟的中国人民在中国共产党领导下所取得的成就感到无限欢欣鼓舞，并把这些成就看成是自己的成就，看成是以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的成就。
    亲爱的同志们：我们在这停留期间，参加了天安门前北京劳动人民大游行的观礼。劳动人民热情洋溢地、在以毛泽东同志为首的党和政府领导人的面前通过，这表明了他们同党和政府之间的联系是多么坚强。同时，我们还同石景山钢铁厂出色的职工们进行了接触，这个厂在一个很短的时间内，变成了巨大的工业基地，并正在以更快的速度变成一座强大的联合企业。我们参观了像人民大会堂、北京火车站这样巨大的工程。天才的中国工人、工程师和技师们设计和建筑了这些工程的事实，表明了天才的中国人民的巨大才能和力量。我们到处受到热烈欢迎。这种欢迎表达了兄弟的中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民、党和政府的热爱。我们非常亲切地会见了你们光荣的领袖——毛泽东同志、刘少奇同志、朱德同志、周恩来同志和其他的领导同志，并向他们转达了我国领导同志特别是霍查同志的最好、最衷心的祝贺。
    我们又一次看到了中国人民同党的血肉相关的联系。我们以无限愉快的心情看到：工人、农民、知识分子、男女青年和全体劳动人民正以冲天的干劲，贯彻着党和毛泽东同志的指示，他们已成为社会主义和共产主义的光荣建设者。这表明了你们党和政府的路线是多么正确。事实上，你们过去和现在都一直沿着党和毛泽东同志所指出的马克思列宁主义的正确路线前进，你们所取得的这些巨大的成就，是任何人也抹杀不了的。中国消除了无法忍受的失业现象，消除了人剥削人的制度，工业、农业、文化、教育和科学等方面都高速度地发展着。这些事实是无论如何也不能抹杀的。今年8月底的生产同去年的同期相比，钢增加了40％左右，铁增加了40％左右，煤增加了25％，电力增加了45％，化学肥料增加了一点二倍等，这些事实是不可否认的。最近几年来的农业发展和人民公社的建立已取得了极大的成果。中国人民公社的农民正在为战胜由于旱涝等自然灾害而造成的困难和扩大灌溉进行着顽强的斗争。
    这些成就说明，你们为在今后取得更大的成就，已经打下了基础。这一切使我们感到无限高兴。这是整个社会主义阵营的巨大成就。
    亲爱的同志们，阿尔巴尼亚的处境也和你们亲爱的中国一样。从前曾经是落后的阿尔巴尼亚已经进入先进国家的行列。解放后的十五年来，工业生产提高了二十一倍半，农业生产比战前也有了提高，耕地面积增加了，水利灌溉等方面都扩大了。现在，每五个人当中就有一个人在学校或训练班里学习。过去85％的人民是文盲的我国，现在已能每年培养出成百近千为人民服务的工程师、农艺师、经济工作者、医生和教师。我们正在发展着重要的经济部门，如石油开采和加工，铬矿、镍矿、煤炭、沥青等矿产的开采。生产消费品的工业也有了巨大的发展。
    农业几乎已全部合作化，农业合作社制度对个体经营的农业所具有的优越性，现在已经显示出来。
    文化、艺术和科学事业已经成为劳动群众的财富。我国劳动群众的文化物质水平正在逐年不断提高。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民同党和政府之间的团结，同我们的领袖霍查同志之间的团结，是坚如钢铁的。世界上没有任何力量可以破坏这种团结，因为以霍查同志为首的劳动党，在它所领导的光荣的民族解放斗争中，和在今天迅速进行的社会主义建设中，锻炼了这种团结。
    这些成就的泉源是什么呢？这些成就的泉源就是不朽的马克思列宁主义思想，是以党的奠基人、马克思列宁主义者霍查同志为首的我们光荣的劳动党。我们的党在它整个的革命历程中，始终执行自己的正确的马克思列宁主义路线。党向来没有，也永远不会在它的马克思列宁主义阵地上有所动摇。我们的敌人——帝国主义者及其代理人南斯拉夫修正主义者，千方百计地企图破坏我们党同人民的联系，企图用污蔑、诽谤，用党的叛徒的敌对活动，用破坏和派遣特务，用施加压力，来分化我们的党。但是，他们一向都失败了，而且还将遭到失败。我们党和人民向来都是胜利者。我们的党和人民就像你们的党和人民一样，是融化在一起的。他们为建设社会主义勇往直前。此外，我们获得这些巨大的成就，是由于我们的朋友——苏联、人民中国和社会主义阵营所有其它国家所给予的慷慨的和国际主义的援助。借此机会，我们向中国政府和中国共产党表示感谢，感谢他们给予阿尔巴尼亚人民的巨大的、国际主义的援助。
    我们正在前进，我们完全相信我们的政治、思想、经济路线是正确的，因为我们的路线是以马克思列宁主义思想为依据的。马克思列宁主义曾经是也永远是我们劳动党的指针。
    牢不可破的友谊把阿中两国人民连接在一起。这种友谊是深厚的，它得到了我们两党、霍查同志和毛泽东同志长期的锤炼。我们高兴的是：在我们两国，都建立了友好协会——阿尔巴尼亚的阿中友好协会和中国的中阿友好协会。我们的阿中友协像你们一样，为加强我们两国人民之间的友谊，为宣传兄弟般的中国人民在各方面所取得的成就，作了良好的工作。阿尔巴尼亚人民从你们的成就中吸取新的力量，并且百倍地增强了力量，完成自己的任务。我们高兴地看到：你们的中阿友好协会也正在进行着同样的工作。你们和我们都进行着有助于加强我们新型的关系的可贵的工作，这种关系是不朽的马克思列宁主义思想所建立的。
    同志们，请允许我在这个群众大会的讲坛上，对伟大的中国、英雄的和天才的中国人民，对光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志，表示阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的无限热爱。
    我们和你们都是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的成员。我们和你们都珍惜以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结并为此而进行斗争。我们和你们都为马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的纯洁而斗争，我们和你们都为不同制度各国之间的和平共处而斗争，我们和你们现在要、将来也要为保卫和平、警惕地保卫既得的胜利，揭露以美国为首的帝国主义好战分子。我们和你们现在和将来都反对现代修正主义，特别是反对作为帝国主义代理人的南斯拉夫修正主义。因为，正如1957年莫斯科共产党和工人党代表会议所指出的，修正主义是当前世界共产主义和工人运动中的最主要的危险。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府过去和现在都支持苏联致力于保卫和平、裁军、禁止核武器和争取不同制度国家和平共处的立场。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民及其政府认为：以美国为首的帝国主义集团反对中华人民共和国加入联合国组织的立场是不可饶恕的，并指责这种立场。毫不代表中国人民的蒋介石卖国贼应该从联合国组织中滚出去。人民中国应该取得自己应得的席位，因为没有中华人民共和国的参加，任何国际问题都不能获得解决。中华人民共和国以其一贯的和平政策，成了保卫世界和平和安全的重要因素，中华人民共和国政府同许多亚非国家签订了互不侵犯和友好条约，就是中华人民共和国和平政策的新的证明。
    我们严厉谴责美帝国主义者侵占台湾，我们相信，台湾将一定回到自己祖国的怀抱。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚的共产党员正在准备迎接即将举行的党的第四次代表大会和我国解放十六周年。在代表大会上，将总结在以霍查同志为首的党的正确领导下取得的宏伟成就。第四次代表大会将通过1961—1965年的第三个五年计划。这个五年计划将为我们的社会主义建设开辟更加光辉的远景，我们将走上把我国从一个农业工业国变成一个工业农业国的道路。人民的生活将得到改善。我们对我国人民幸福的未来充满信心，我们党和人民将一起，以自己的不倦的劳动来建设这个未来。
    在为完成任务的斗争中，我们将要进行艰巨的工作。在我们党的领导下，在我们的朋友的帮助下，我们将克服面临的一切困难。
    我们走着共同的道路——建设社会主义和共产主义的道路。为了在这条道路上取得成就，我们需要社会主义国家之间的真诚的、坚强的和国际主义的友谊。我们高兴地看到：阿中友谊正在日益加强，因为这一友谊现在和将来都是服务于我们共同的目标的。
    亲爱的中国同志们，兄弟们，请让我在结束讲话时为阿中牢不可破的友谊欢呼。
    英雄的兄弟般的中国人民万岁！
    以霍查同志和毛泽东同志为首的我们两国的马克思列宁主义的党万岁！
    以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
