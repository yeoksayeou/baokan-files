Concentrating Efforts to Rush Production of Key Products for Grain and Steel Increase
Shanghai Chemical Machinery Plant Completes Fertilizer Equipment and Small Blast Furnace Supporting Tasks Ahead of Schedule

(According to a report in the Liberation Daily) The Shanghai Chemical Machinery Plant, proceeding from a global perspective, adopted various effective measures to complete the task of providing supporting equipment for fertilizer equipment and small blast furnaces ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas, while also driving the production of other products.

At the beginning of the grain and steel-centered production increase and economy movement, the plant's Party general branch carried out ideological education of "the whole country as a single chessboard" for all employees. In order to ensure the production of key products, they adopted the methods of "determining," "coordinating," and "innovating." "Determining" means assigning people, tasks, machine tools, and schedules according to the plan. "Coordinating" means that workshops and work types engage in large-scale collaboration and close cooperation. "Innovating" means carrying out technical revolution to address the weak links in production. They first adjusted the original plan and inspected the plant's thirty or forty products. Based on the principle of prioritizing key products before general products, they decided to produce fertilizer equipment and small blast furnace supporting products ahead of schedule and then arrange general products item by item according to urgency.

To ensure the early and over-fulfillment of key product production tasks, the key lies in the No. 3 workshop, which manufactures fertilizer centrifuges. The Party general branch adopted the method of concentrating superior forces to fight an annihilation war, mobilizing various workshops to help the No. 3 workshop solve key production problems. Each workshop and group launched communist-style large-scale collaboration. The No. 4 workshop voluntarily gave up two ten-foot machine tools, a small planer, and a high-speed, high-efficiency eight-foot large lathe. They used two six-foot small lathes to replace the eight-foot large lathe for processing, accelerated the speed, and improved the tools, reducing the time quota for turning the main shaft from ten hours to four hours. As a result, they supported the production of key equipment and ensured the completion of their own workshop's tasks.

In order to solve key problems in the production of key products, the plant's leading cadres went deep into the workshops, worked with the masses to find the key, and mobilized the masses to carry out technical revolution to break through weak links. For example, they found that the fertilizer equipment body was large and the planer was small, the processing time was long, which affected the production progress. They worked with workers and technicians to study, improve the design on the premise of ensuring product quality, reduce the body by one-third, and the processing time from 76 hours to 46 hours. They also helped workers adopt assembly line operation methods, promoted advanced jigs and tools, and increased the output of the machine body by an average of two times. In the No. 1 workshop, which produces small blast furnace equipment, there were not enough lathes. The leading cadres mobilized the workers to transform a native combined machine into a native shaper small lathe through technical revolution, improved the large lathe's turning tool, and accelerated the speed, so that the shift output rapidly increased from two pieces to four, six, eight, and a maximum of ten pieces.

    集中力量赶制增产粮钢的重点产品
    上海化工机械厂提前完成化肥设备和小高炉配套任务
    据解放日报消息　上海化工机械厂从全局观点出发，采取各种有效措施，提前和超额完成化肥设备配套和小高炉配套任务，同时带动了其他产品的生产。
    以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动刚开始时，这个厂的党总支就向全厂职工进行了“全国一盘棋”的思想教育。为了保证重点产品的生产，他们采取了“定”“协”“革”的办法。“定”是根据计划定人、定任务、定机床、定进度。“协”是各车间各工种大搞协作，紧密配合。“革”是针对生产中的薄弱环节，大闹技术革命。他们首先调整了原订计划，检查了全厂的三、四十种产品，根据先重点后一般的原则，决定提前生产化肥设备和小高炉配套产品，再根据轻重缓急逐项安排一般产品。
    要确保重点产品的生产任务提前和超额完成，关键在于制造化肥离心机的三车间。党总支采取了集中优势兵力打歼灭战的办法，发动各个车间帮助三车间解决生产关键。各车间各小组开展了共产主义大协作。四车间主动让出两台十尺机床、一台小刨床和一部车速最快、效率最高的八尺大车床，自己用两台六尺小车床代替八尺大车床加工，并加快车速，改进刀具，把车主轴的工时定额由十小时压缩到四小时。结果，既支援了重点设备生产，又保证了本车间任务的完成。
    为了解决重点产品生产中的关键问题，厂的领导干部深入车间，和群众一起找关键，发动群众大搞技术革命，突破薄弱环节。如他们发现化肥设备机身大，刨床小，加工时间长，影响生产进度，就和工人、技术人员一起研究，在保证产品质量的前提下，改进了设计，使机身缩小三分之一，加工时间由每只七十六小时压缩到四十六小时。他们还帮助工人采用流水操作法，推广了先进的工夹具、刀具，使机身产量平均提高了二倍。生产小高炉设备的一车间车床不够用，领导干部就发动工人通过技术革命把一台土联合机改装成土牛头小车床，并改进大车床的车刀，加快了车速，使班产量由两只迅速提高到四只，六只，八只，最高达十只。
