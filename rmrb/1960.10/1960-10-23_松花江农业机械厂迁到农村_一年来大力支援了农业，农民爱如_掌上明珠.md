    Songhua River Agricultural Machinery Factory Moves to the Countryside
    Vigorously Supporting Agriculture for a Year, Farmers Cherish it Like a "Pearl in the Palm"
    (Our dispatch) Reporters Pan Chonghan and Wang Ruichang report: The Songhua River Agricultural Machinery Factory, which moved from Harbin to Wuchang County, has done a great deal to support agricultural technical transformation in less than a year since arriving in the countryside. There, people already regard this factory as a "pearl in the palm."
    In the past, this factory had already made great contributions to supporting agricultural technical transformation. In order to better support agricultural technical transformation, in November of last year, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to move this agricultural machinery factory, which mainly manufactures paddy field machinery, to Wuchang County, where there are more paddy fields. When they moved the factory, it was winter, and although there were many specific difficulties at the beginning of the relocation work, the workers established the idea of serving agriculture and were determined to overcome these difficulties and build a socialist countryside with their own hands. When the machinery and equipment were transported to Wuchang, the transportation capacity could not meet the requirements, so they moved it to the site themselves. When equipment was lacking, they manufactured it locally. When the factory building was not enough, they expanded it themselves. They finally overcame various difficulties, completed the relocation task ahead of schedule, and quickly put it into production. After the factory was put into production, it quickly manufactured a large number of paddy field machinery and water conservancy tools adapted to local characteristics, and began to arm the commune-run industry, immediately becoming an important force for Wuchang County to support agricultural technical transformation.
    After arriving in the countryside, in order to meet the needs of the farming season, this factory, together with the two small agricultural machinery factories originally in Wuchang County, produced a large number of seeders, enabling the mechanization of paddy field sowing throughout the county. After the factory arrived in the county, it took the initiative to link up with various people's communes, and supported the Gongnong, Xingsheng, Guanghui, Shengli, and Anjia people's communes with more than 2,800 units (pieces) of seeders, weeding machines, hoe blades, and harvesters. It also used the 12.5-kilowatt generators it produced to help Chonghe, Zhiguang, Guanghui and other three people's commune locations realize industrial power and lighting electrification.
    After moving to the countryside, the Songhua River Agricultural Machinery Factory also actively and proactively armed the commune-run industry. In the past six months, it has helped various people's communes train more than 40 technicians, and extracted more than 200 units (pieces) of lathes, bench drills, grinding machines, spring hammers, vices, and small casting equipment to support the development of the commune industry, creating extremely favorable conditions for the formation of an agricultural machinery industry system. For example, half a year ago, the Gongnong People's Commune had an agricultural tool factory that could only repair and manufacture simple agricultural tools. Since the Songhua River Agricultural Machinery Factory linked up with this factory and provided strong support, it can now manufacture paddy field machinery and repair tractors, power machines, large-scale drainage and irrigation machinery and other equipment, enabling this agricultural tool factory to undertake the machine tool repair and manufacturing tasks of the entire commune, achieving medium repairs without leaving the district and major repairs without leaving the commune. Half a year ago, the Wuchang Town People's Commune Agricultural Tool Factory did not have a mechanical workshop. After being supported and equipped by the Songhua River Agricultural Machinery Factory, its production capacity was greatly improved. In addition to repairing paddy field plows and threshing machines, it has manufactured 35 large agricultural machines in the past six months, including paddy field weeding machines, shoveling machines, paddy field seeders, rice transplanters, automatic rice threshers, corn shellers, and general-purpose threshers, which not only solved the repair, distribution, and manufacturing of the commune, but also supported other communes.
    After the Songhua River Agricultural Machinery Factory moved to the countryside, the significant difference in production is that it not only has the task of producing agricultural machinery, but also undertakes repair tasks. This is more closely integrated with agricultural production. According to these characteristics, they have adopted various forms of support for agriculture. In order to facilitate the arrangement of factory production and meet the necessary agricultural machinery repair needs of various communes, in addition to the factory's formal workshops, a farm tool repair and distribution workshop was added, and a support agriculture amateur team was formed by more than ten technicians from various technical trades of car, fitter, planer, milling machine, in order to solve various technical problems in repairing and distributing machines for the countryside. In order to save rural labor and animal power and avoid the round-trip transportation of large-scale machinery in various communes due to repairs, they also organized technical service teams composed of workers with higher technical skills from each trade during each farming season to go deep into the communes to inspect and repair machines. For example, in May, 2,250 mu of rice in Changbao Commune had already been sown, but five water pumps could not be installed. The factory sent two technicians overnight, and fought for four or five days and nights to install all five water pumps, helping the technicians to take care of the machines, until the paddy fields were irrigated before returning. Before the autumn harvest this year, they organized a technical service team of nine people to go deep into the management areas and production teams of six communes, and inspected and repaired 147 relatively large agricultural machines such as tractors, diesel engines, gas engines, threshing machines, rice milling machines, threshers, feed pulverizers, and generators. This alone saved more than 470 rural laborers and saved more than 6,100 yuan in transportation and repair costs. They also helped the commune industry improve its technical level and became technical consultants for the countryside. In addition to organizing technical service teams according to the farming season and in a planned way, the workers used their weekends and holidays to go to nearby communes and factories to help solve some technical problems. This has become an important part of the workers' holiday activities. Sometimes, if the commune or factory has parts that cannot be solved, they are also taken to the Songhua River Machinery Factory, where they borrow lathes and tools to work.
    After the agricultural machinery factory went to the countryside, due to more contact with agricultural production practice, there has been a great improvement in technology and product quality. The factory has developed from being able to produce only general agricultural machinery such as shoveling machines and planters in the past to now being able to produce more technically complex products such as electric plows, Taigu-style harvesters, generators, water pumps, and band saws for forestry, and there have also been new improvements in product design. The factory's equipment and workers have also more than doubled compared to before moving to the countryside. (Attached picture)

    松花江农业机械厂迁到农村
    一年来大力支援了农业，农民爱如“掌上明珠”
    本报讯　记者潘冲汉、王瑞昌报道：从哈尔滨市迁到五常县的松花江农业机械厂，到农村不到一年，对支援农业技术改造就作了很多事情。在那里，人们已经把这个厂看作“掌上明珠”。
    这个厂过去在支援农业技术改造中，就作出了很大贡献。为了更好地支援农业技术改造，在去年11月，中共哈尔滨市委决定把这个以制造水田机械为主的农业机械厂，迁到水田较多的五常县。他们迁厂时正是冬季，迁厂工作开始虽然有很多具体困难，但职工们树立了为农业服务的思想，决心战胜这些困难，用自己的双手建设社会主义农村。当机械设备运到五常后，运输力量不能满足要求，他们自己动手往现场搬运，设备缺乏，他们就就地制造，厂房不够，就自己动手扩建。他们终于战胜了各种困难，提前完成了迁厂任务，迅速投入生产。这个厂投入生产后，很快就制造出适应本地特点的大批水田机械、水利工具，并开始武装社办工业，立即成为五常县支援农业技术改造的重要力量。
    这个厂到农村后，为了适应农事季节需要，他们和五常县原有两个小农业机械厂生产出大量播种机，使全县水田播种实现机械化。这个厂到县后，就主动与各人民公社挂钩，支援了工农、兴胜、光辉、胜利、安家等人民公社播种机、除草机、锄板、收割机等两千八百多台（件），并用他们生产的十二点五瓩的发电机，帮助冲河、志广、光辉等三个人民公社所在地实现了工业动力和照明电气化。
    松花江农业机械厂迁到农村后，还积极主动地武装了社办工业。半年来，帮助各人民公社培养了四十余名技工，并抽出车床、台钻、砂轮机、弹簧锤、虎钳子、小型铸造设备等二百多台（件），支援了公社工业的发展，为农业机械工业体系的形成创造了极为有利的条件。如工农人民公社在半年前有一个只能修理、制造简易农具的农具厂，自从松花江农业机械厂与这个厂挂钩并进行大力支援后，现在既能制造水田机械，又能修理拖拉机、动力机、大型排灌机械等设备，使这个农具厂承担了全公社的机具修造任务，做到了中修不出区，大修不出社。五常镇人民公社农具厂在半年前还没有机械车间，经过松花江农业机械厂支援装备后，生产能力大大提高，除能修理水田洋犁、打稻机外，半年来共制造了水田除草机、铲趟机、水田播种机、插秧机、水稻自动脱谷机、苞米脱粒机、通用脱谷机等大型农业机械三十五台，既解决了本公社的修配、制造，又支援了其它公社。
    松花江农业机械厂迁到农村后，在生产上的显著不同，就是既有生产农业机械的任务，又担负修理任务。这样和农业生产结合得更密切了。他们根据这些特点，对支援农业采取了多种多样的形式。为了便于安排工厂生产，满足各公社必要的农机具修理，在工厂正式车间以外，又增加了一个农具修配车间，并由车、钳、刨、铣各技术工种的十余名技术工人组成了支援农业业余小组，以便解决给农村修配机具上的各种技术问题。为了节约农村劳力和畜力，避免各公社大型机械因为修理而往返运输，他们还在每个农事季节，由各工种技术较高的工人，组成技术服务团，深入公社检修机具。如在5月间，常堡公社二千二百五十亩水稻已经播了种，就是五台抽水机安装不上，这个厂就连夜派去两名技术工人，奋战了四、五昼夜，把五台抽水机全部安好，帮助技术员看管机器，一直到把水田灌好才回来。在今年秋收前，他们又组成九个人的技术服务团，深入到六个公社的管理区和生产队，检修了拖拉机、柴油机、煤气机、打稻机、制米机、脱谷机、饲料粉碎机、发电机等一百四十七台较大型的农业机具。仅这次就为农村节约了劳动力四百七十多个，节约运费、修理费六千一百多元。他们并帮助公社工业提高了技术水平，成为农村的技术顾问。这个工厂除了按农事季节和有计划地组织技术服务团以外，工人们利用星期假日到附近公社、工厂去帮助解决一些技术问题。这已成为工人们假日活动的重要内容。有时公社、工厂有解决不了的部件，也拿到松花江机械厂，借了车床、工具就干起来。
    这个农业机械厂下乡后，由于更多联系农业生产实践，在技术上和产品质量上有很大提高。这个厂已由过去只能生产铲趟机、点播机等一般农业机械，发展到现在已能生产电犁、太古式收割机、发电机、水泵和林业用的带锯机等技术比较复杂的产品了，并在产品设计上也有新的改进。工厂的设备和工人也比迁到农村前增长了一倍多。（附图片）
