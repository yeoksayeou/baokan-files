Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th. To celebrate the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Liu Xiao held a grand reception at the embassy building this afternoon.

Among the guests attending today's reception were Soviet party and government leaders Kozlov, Kosygin, Suslov, Furtseva, Kahnberzin, Soviet Supreme Soviet of the Union Chairman Lobanov, Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium Deputy Chairman Organov, Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium Secretary Georgadze, Soviet Council of Ministers Deputy Chairmen Novikov and Ustinov, as well as heads of many government departments and senior generals of the Soviet army.

Also attending the reception were representatives from the Soviet cultural, artistic, and educational circles and mass organizations. Many foreign envoys stationed in the Soviet Union also attended the reception. The guests frequently raised their glasses to congratulate the Chinese people on their great festival. The reception was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere.

Ambassador Liu Xiao and Kozlov spoke at the reception successively.

After mentioning the great victories of socialist revolution and socialist construction achieved by the new China in the eleven years since its birth, Ambassador Liu said that our victories and achievements came from the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and from the boundless wisdom and soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of our people. The experience of construction in the past eleven years has made us more deeply realize that the Party's general line for socialist construction is entirely correct. Liu Xiao said that the achievements of China's socialist construction are inseparable from the great assistance of the Soviet Union. The Soviet government and the Soviet people have given multifaceted assistance to our country's construction cause, which we are sincerely grateful for and will never forget.

Liu Xiao said that under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have made great achievements in comprehensively developing the cause of communist construction. The Soviet people have always stood at the forefront of mankind's construction of a communist society, attracting the attention of the people of the world. The Chinese people regard the achievements of the Soviet people as their own achievements and are encouraged by this.

Liu Xiao then said that China and the Soviet Union are socialist powers with common ideals and fraternal allies sharing weal and woe. Our two countries have established comprehensive friendly mutual assistance and cooperation relations, which are entirely in line with the fundamental interests of the Chinese and Soviet peoples, and also in line with the common interests of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese people will strive to continue to enhance this fraternal friendly cooperation and strengthen the great unity between our two countries.

Liu Xiao finally said, let us raise our glasses to the great and unbreakable friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, to the firm unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to the great Soviet people standing at the forefront of mankind's construction of a communist society, to the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to the health of the leading comrades of the CPSU Central Committee headed by Comrade Khrushchev, and to world peace.

In his speech, Kozlov said that the founding of the People's Republic of China and its joining the fraternal family of the people of socialist countries is another clear proof of the victory of Marxism-Leninism and another powerful blow to the dying imperialist system. The Soviet people, the people of all countries in the powerful socialist camp, and all progressive mankind are celebrating the glorious festival of the birth of the People's Republic of China together with the Chinese people.

Kozlov said that the relations between the Soviet people, the Chinese people, and all socialist fraternal countries are based on the unshakeable foundation of Marxism-Leninism and on the principles of proletarian internationalism that have been tested by history. We firmly believe that Soviet-Chinese friendship and the friendship of the people of all socialist countries will develop and strengthen. Our rock-solid unity is the victory of the great communist idea and a prerequisite for the invincibility of the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism. Kozlov said that the Soviet people are sincerely delighted with the great achievements made by the hard-working Chinese people in all aspects of socialist construction and in the realization of fundamental social and economic transformation. The Soviet people sincerely hope that the people's China will achieve new and greater victories on the front of socialist construction.

Kozlov then said that since its founding, the People's Republic of China has appeared on the international stage as a major power, safeguarding the cause of peace and security for the people of all countries. China played an important role at the famous Bandung Conference, which promoted the establishment of amity and cooperation between Asian and African countries. The People's Republic of China is one of the founders of the famous Five Principles, and it expressed its desire to realize the policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems by initiating the Five Principles. The Soviet Union resolutely condemns the imperialists, especially the US ruling clique, for attempting to exclude the People's Republic of China from solving important international issues. Comrade Khrushchev reiterated in his speech at the 15th session of the UN General Assembly that the situation in which the great Chinese people do not have legitimate representatives in the United Nations is absurd. We are deeply convinced that the day is not far off when the political corpse of Chiang Kai-shek will be expelled from the United Nations and the representatives of the great Chinese people will occupy their due position in the United Nations.

Kozlov finally shouted: Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the Communist Party of China and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong! Long live the unbreakable friendship between the great people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China! Long live the powerful socialist camp, the indestructible fortress of world peace!

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 30th. Chinese Ambassador to Albania Luo Shigao held a reception here tonight to celebrate the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Albanian Labor Party Central Committee First Secretary Hoxha, Central Political Bureau members Baluku, Nushi, Marko, Koleka, and Albanian People's Assembly Presidium Deputy Chairman Peza and other party and government leaders, heads of various people's organizations, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Albania were invited to attend the reception.

Ambassador Luo Shigao and Comrade Hoxha spoke at the reception successively.

Ambassador Luo Shigao said that we, together with the people of socialist countries, have not only made unremitting efforts to ease international tensions and safeguard world peace, resolutely supported the national liberation movements of all oppressed nations, and supported all initiatives and actions conducive to peace and progressive causes, but are also willing to coexist peacefully with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles. However, imperialism, especially the number one enemy of the world's people, US imperialism, has done all kinds of bad things, and the modern revisionists, the servants of imperialism, are desperately serving their masters. Therefore, we must be vigilant and resolutely fight them head-on. Luo Shigao said that the Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the achievements and brilliant prospects of fraternal Albania. He said that the Marxist-Leninist Albanian Labor Party, headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, resolutely opposes imperialism, safeguards world peace, holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and has made significant contributions in the struggle against modern revisionism and in safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism. We express our heartfelt admiration for this heroic spirit and high degree of revolutionary principle. The friendship between our socialist countries, built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, is unbreakable.

Hoxha said in his speech that the reason for the profound changes that have taken place in the fraternal People's Republic of China in the past eleven years is: the Chinese Communist Party's steadfastness in correctly and creatively implementing the principles of Marxism-Leninism, the close ties between the Chinese Communist Party and the working masses, and the respect and love of the entire Chinese people for the Communist Party and its Leninist Central Committee and for the great son of the people and the Party, Comrade Mao Zedong. The talented Chinese people have continued to make very great achievements in the victorious socialist construction. This is also due to the fact that the Chinese Communist Party has waged a correct and principled unwavering struggle to defend the purity of Marxist-Leninist principles, and because it has waged a struggle against modern revisionism and against any other harmful anti-Marxist-Leninist manifestations. The great victories achieved by the People's Republic of China in the past eleven years have made it a great world power, a staunch fighter for peace and socialism with ever-increasing international prestige.

Hoxha said that the foreign policy of the Chinese Communist Party has always followed the highest principles of Leninism, the policy of peace and friendship among all peoples, and the highest principles of proletarian internationalism. This great and glorious party with 14 million members is a huge force in the international communist movement. It is united with all communist and workers' parties in the world, advancing side by side, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and preventing it from being stained. As a member of the socialist camp family, the great People's Republic of China plays a huge and important role internationally. It constantly struggles to consolidate and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and makes very great contributions to the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace, to strive for the victory of the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and social systems, to strive for disarmament, and to correctly resolve all outstanding international issues. The Chinese Communist Party and the great Chinese people correctly view the liberation of oppressed people from imperialism and colonialism on the revolutionary road, and do everything possible to help them achieve national liberation. It is because of this correct struggle that the People's Republic of China has won respect and sympathy not only in Asia but also throughout the world. Therefore, the aggressive imperialists, especially the US imperialists, the number one enemy of the world's people, and their loyal servants, the despicable Yugoslav revisionists, are extremely shamelessly spreading rumors and slanders, calling China a "country that does not want peace but wants war and does not advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems," and so on. But all these attempts are in vain. Hoxha pointed out that the bloodthirsty US imperialists, in order to undermine the sympathy and great influence that China is constantly winning internationally, stubbornly attempt to obstruct China from obtaining legal status in the United Nations or other international organizations. Allowing US imperialism to continue to treat the People's Republic of China in this way is tantamount to allowing it to attack the strongest position of our socialist camp. He said that any attempt by US imperialism to oppose China will be severely hit by the socialist camp, communists throughout the world, and all progressive mankind.

Hoxha said that we must ruthlessly expose the frantic war preparations of the US imperialists and their lackeys. We must wage a relentless struggle and expose them and the Belgrade revisionists politically and ideologically, because only in this way will it contribute to the cause of true peace. We have followed this path, and we will unswervingly follow this Marxist-Leninist path in the future.

Hoxha continued that the Albanian people have an unbreakable friendship with the great Chinese people. Our party and government have supported and will continue to support China's peaceful policies and its international rights with all our strength. Our people and party are pleased to have the Chinese people as such a great and loyal friend, and will do everything possible to safeguard and increasingly develop the strong friendship between our two fraternal peoples, which is built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism.

The reception was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere. The Chinese Sichuan Song and Dance Troupe, which is currently visiting Albania, performed song and dance programs during the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 30th. Our Ambassador to Bulgaria Zhu Qiwu gave a grand reception here tonight to celebrate the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Bulgarian National Assembly Presidium Chairman G.F., Council of Ministers Chairman Yugov and other Bulgarian party and government leaders Bulgaranov, Mikhailov, Staykov, L. Damyanov, Dimov, Plahov, Todorov, Z. Zhivkov, Georgiev and others attended the reception.

Chinese Ambassador to Bulgaria Zhu Qiwu and Bulgarian Council of Ministers Chairman Yugov spoke at the reception successively.

In his speech, Ambassador Zhu Qiwu said: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are holding high the victorious banners of the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and are spiritedly engaged in selfless labor.

He said: This year is a year of continued leap forward on the basis of the two-year Great Leap Forward. At present, our people are carrying out an increase production and practice economy movement centered on grain and steel with selfless labor, and are striving to complete and overfulfill this year's national economic plan.

Zhu Qiwu said that in the process of our country's socialist construction, we have continuously received assistance from the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries. The Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude for this.

When talking about the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people, Zhu Qiwu said: The fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people is built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. The development of this friendship is conducive to the socialist construction of our two countries and to strengthening the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Yugov then spoke. He said that in the past eleven years, profound changes have taken place in the life of the People's Republic of China. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have made great achievements in all aspects of social, economic and cultural life. These achievements are the result of the creative strength and talent of the Chinese working class, working peasants and intellectuals. Yugov expressed heartfelt congratulations to the Chinese people for their victory, and hoped that the Chinese people would achieve even greater achievements under the great and sacred banner of Marxism-Leninism in the struggle to win the victory of socialism in their free motherland.

When talking about the friendship between the Bulgarian and Chinese peoples, he said that we believe that this friendship will be consolidated and unbreakable year by year, because the inexhaustible source of its strength is the Marxist-Leninist doctrine, the principles of proletarian internationalism, our common goals, and the unstoppable desire to move towards the victory of socialism and communism; because this friendship is developing under the happy sunshine of the great friendship of the peoples of all countries in the powerful socialist camp headed by the powerful Soviet Union.

The reception took place in a friendly and warm atmosphere.

The reception was held in a friendly and warm atmosphere. Ambassador He Wei and Premier Pham Van Dong spoke at the reception successively.

In his speech, Ambassador He Wei said that today, the entire Chinese people are reviewing the great victories they have achieved with joy, and are also looking forward to the future with confidence. After mentioning the construction achievements made by our country under the guidance of the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, he said that we are very pleased to see that after the restoration of peace, the industrious and brave Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, quickly restored the national economy that had been devastated by long-term colonialism and war, and implemented a three-year plan for developing and transforming the economy and developing culture. Socialist transformation and socialist construction have made great achievements. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has not only established friendly relations with many peaceful and neutral countries in Asia and Africa, but is also developing friendly relations with more peace-loving countries. It has made unremitting efforts to maintain the implementation of the Geneva Agreement and peace in the Indochina region. Today, the peaceful reunification of Vietnam has not yet been realized, and this is the result of the consistent obstruction and sabotage by US imperialism and its running dogs. We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people's desire for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will definitely be realized, and the Chinese people will always support the Vietnamese people's just struggle until they achieve final victory.

Premier Pham Van Dong then spoke, saying that in the past eleven years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have made great achievements on all fronts. The Vietnamese people are delighted and encouraged, and regard these victories as their own.

Premier Pham Van Dong then talked about how the People's Republic of China is a socialist country with 650 million people, a peace-loving and strong country, and has great prestige and widespread influence throughout the world, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It has made great contributions to strengthening the strength of the socialist camp headed by the great USSR and to the cause of the struggle of the people of the world for peace, democracy, national independence and social progress. He stated that China must be restored to its legitimate seat in the United Nations. He said that the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam warmly support the peaceful foreign policy of the great People's Republic of China and the achievements of this policy. We firmly support the proposal of the People's Republic of China to sign a treaty of non-aggression and peace among the countries of Asia and the Pacific region and to turn this region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Premier Pham Van Dong pointed out that in order to cover up their unspeakable conspiracies, the US imperialists are conspiring to use the name of the United Nations to interfere in Laos. The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam resolutely oppose the conspiracy and actions of US imperialism and its vassal states to interfere in Laos, and firmly believe that with the support of the world's peace-loving forces, the just struggle of the Laotian people will definitely be victorious.

Premier Pham Van Dong said that Vietnam and China are two brotherly countries that have always been closely united and helping each other. The Vietnamese people will always remember that the Chinese Communist Party, government, and people once fully supported the Vietnamese people's war of resistance to save the country, made positive contributions to the victory of the Geneva Agreement and the restoration of peace in Vietnam, and are currently generously assisting the Vietnamese people in socialist construction in the north in various ways, and firmly support our struggle to achieve peaceful reunification of our country.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 30th. Chinese Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic Wang Guoquan held a reception tonight to celebrate the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party Ulbricht, Deputy Chairman of the State Council, Prime Minister of the Republic Grotewohl, Deputy Chairman of the State Council, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber Dieckmann, Chairman of the National Council of the National Front Correns, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic Bolz attended the reception.

Commander of the Soviet Armed Forces in Germany General Yabokovsky, diplomatic envoys from various countries to Germany, senior officers of the Soviet Armed Forces in Germany, and secretaries from various countries of the Secretariat of the International Democratic Women's Federation also attended the reception.

Ambassador Wang Guoquan spoke at the beginning of the reception. After outlining the tremendous achievements of our current socialist construction, he said that in the past eleven years, the friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese and German people have been continuously developed and consolidated. The Chinese people have constantly received the support and assistance of the government and people of the German Democratic Republic in their cause of building socialism. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the government and people of the German Democratic Republic. Wang Guoquan said that the Chinese people are very concerned about the major achievements made by their brothers, the people of the German Democratic Republic, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of the German Democratic Republic and the government of the German Democratic Republic, in the struggle to build socialism, oppose West German militarism, and safeguard peace in Europe and the world. The Chinese people fully support the German people's resolute struggle against West German militarism's intensified atomic armament with the support of US imperialism. We firmly believe that the result of the struggle will be the victory of the German people.

He said that the Chinese people have always cherished the friendly unity with the people of socialist countries, and will make the greatest efforts to continuously enhance the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and German people and to consolidate and develop the great unity of the socialist camp. Premier Grotewohl then spoke. He said that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which has been tested in battle for a long time, and in solid unity with the entire socialist camp, have achieved tremendous achievements in China's socialist construction with selfless labor. The working people of the German Democratic Republic congratulate you and admire the achievements made by the Chinese people.

Grotewohl said that the People's Republic of China follows the principles of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and implements a foreign policy aimed at establishing friendly and good-neighborly relations with all countries. Today, the People's Republic of China has diplomatic and trade relations with many countries and has concluded agreements and treaties with many countries. However, even today, there are forces in the world who are unwilling to face up to the important role of the People's Republic of China on the international stage. First of all, certain Western countries, headed by the United States, are trying to obstruct the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Grotewohl said that in our struggle to stop West German militarism, the People's Republic of China stands by our side. It has always strived to realize the just demands of the German people. He then expressed the most heartfelt gratitude of the government and people of the German Democratic Republic to the government of the People's Republic of China and all the fraternal Chinese people for these expressions of solidarity. Premier Grotewohl pointed out that the close and fraternal relations between our two countries have been continuously developed and consolidated over the past eleven years. He expressed his firm belief that this friendly relationship will be further developed in the future for the benefit of our two countries and the entire socialist camp.

He finally asked everyone to raise their glasses, for the great Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, for the indestructible friendship between the Chinese and German people, for the invincible and powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and for world peace.

China and North Korea are close brothers in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, and are also friendly neighbors as close as lips and teeth. In the common struggle for socialist construction and against US imperialism and for safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world, they have always supported each other, moved forward together, and formed an unbreakable fighting friendship. We believe that the fraternal friendship between the peoples of the two countries will be further consolidated and developed in the years to come.

Ambassador Qiao Xiaoguang then said, we are pleased to see that the heroic Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, after completing the first five-year plan two and a half years ahead of schedule, are widely carrying out a comprehensive technical innovation movement in order to welcome the magnificent seven-year plan, and are continuing to advance towards greater victories with the spirit of Chollima.

He wished the fraternal Chinese people greater victories in the future.

Choe Yong-gon said that the peoples of North Korea and China are close brothers tightly united and cooperating with each other in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, and are comrades-in-arms who have been connected by flesh and blood in the struggle against the common enemy--the imperialist aggressors--for a long time. During the most difficult time of our people's Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggression of the US imperialists and their lackeys, the Chinese people dispatched the Chinese People's Volunteers to aid our people's struggle.

The Chinese people have consistently and actively supported our people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    庆祝我国建国十一周年
    我驻兄弟国家使节举行盛大招待会
    我驻苏大使的招待会
    新华社莫斯科30日电　为庆祝中华人民共和国成立十一周年，中国驻苏联大使刘晓今天下午在使馆大楼举行了盛大招待会。
    出席今天招待会的来宾中有苏联党和政府领导人科兹洛夫、柯西金、苏斯洛夫、福尔采娃、卡恩别尔津，苏联最高苏维埃联盟院主席洛巴诺夫，苏联最高苏维埃主席团副主席奥尔加诺夫，苏联最高苏维埃主席团秘书格奥尔加泽，苏联部长会议副主席诺维科夫和乌斯季诺夫，以及许多政府部门的负责人和苏联军队高级将领。
    出席招待会的还有苏联文化、艺术、教育界人士和群众团体的代表，许多国家驻苏联外交使节也出席了招待会。来宾们频频举杯祝贺中国人民的伟大节日。招待会上洋溢着热烈友好的气氛。
    刘晓大使和科兹洛夫先后在招待会上讲了话。
    刘大使在提到新中国诞生十一年来所取得的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利之后说，我们的胜利和成就，是来自中国共产党和毛泽东同志的正确领导，来自我国广大群众的无穷智慧和冲天干劲。过去十一年的建设经验，使我们更深刻地体会到党的社会主义建设总路线是完全正确的。刘晓说，中国社会主义建设的成就，是同苏联的巨大援助分不开的。苏联政府和苏联人民对于我国建设事业给予了多方面的援助，这是我们衷心感谢的，永远也不会忘记的。
    刘晓说，苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，在全面开展共产主义建设事业中取得了巨大的成就。苏联人民一直站在人类建设共产主义社会的最前列，吸引着世界人民的注意力。中国人民把苏联人民的成就看成是自己的成就，并为此而感到欢欣鼓舞。
    刘晓接着说，中苏两国是具有共同理想的社会主义大国，是同舟共济的兄弟盟邦。我们两国建立了全面的友好的互助合作关系，这完全符合于中苏两国人民的根本利益，也符合于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的共同利益。中国人民将为继续增进这种兄弟般的友好合作、加强我们两国的伟大团结而努力。
    刘晓最后说，让我们举杯为中苏两国人民伟大的牢不可破的友谊和团结，为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚强团结，为站在人类建设共产主义社会最前列的伟大苏联人民，为光荣的苏联共产党，为以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏共中央领导同志们的健康，为世界和平干杯。
    科兹洛夫在讲话中说，中华人民共和国的成立和加入社会主义国家各国人民的兄弟家庭，是马克思列宁主义学说取得胜利的又一个鲜明的证明，是对垂死的帝国主义制度的又一次有力打击。苏联人民、强大的社会主义阵营的各国人民和全体进步人类正在同中国人民一起庆祝中华人民共和国诞生的光荣节日。
    科兹洛夫说，苏联人民、中国人民和所有社会主义的兄弟国家的关系是建立在不可动摇的马克思列宁主义的基础上，建立在经过历史考验的不可摧毁的无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上的。我们坚信，苏中友谊、社会主义各国人民的友谊必将发展和加强。我们坚如磐石的团结是伟大的共产主义思想的胜利，以及和平、民主和社会主义事业的不可战胜的首要条件。科兹洛夫说，苏联人民对热爱劳动的中国人民在社会主义建设的各个方面，在实现根本的社会、经济改造方面所取得的巨大成就感到真诚的喜悦。苏联人民衷心地希望人民中国在社会主义建设的战线上取得新的巨大胜利。
    科兹洛夫接着说，中华人民共和国成立以来，就作为一个大国出现在国际舞台上，保卫着各国人民的和平和安全的事业。中国曾在著名的万隆会议上起了重要作用，那次会议促使亚非国家之间建立了亲善和合作的关系。中华人民共和国是著名的五项原则的创始者之一，它通过发起五项原则表达了实现不同社会制度国家和平共处的政策的愿望。苏联坚决谴责帝国主义者，首先是美国统治集团想要在解决重要国际问题上排斥中华人民共和国的企图。赫鲁晓夫同志在联合国大会第十五届会议的发言中再次着重指出，联合国中没有伟大中国人民的合法代表这种情况是荒谬的。我们深信，蒋介石政治僵尸，被逐出联合国，由伟大的中国人民的代表在联合国占居应有的位置的时候已经不远了。
    科兹洛夫最后高呼：中华人民共和国万岁！中国共产党及其以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会万岁！苏联和中华人民共和国两国伟大人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！世界和平的不可摧毁的堡垒——强大的社会主义阵营万岁！
    我驻阿大使的招待会
    新华社地拉那30日电　中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使罗士高今晚在此间举行招待会，庆祝中华人民共和国成立十一周年。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第一书记霍查、中央政治局委员巴卢库、努什、马尔科、科列加和阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团副主席佩扎等党政领导人，各人民团体负责人以及各国驻阿尔巴尼亚外交使节都应邀出席了招待会。
    罗士高大使和霍查同志先后在招待会上讲话。
    罗士高大使说，我们和社会主义各国人民一起，不仅为缓和国际紧张局势和保卫世界和平作了不懈的努力，坚决支持一切被压迫民族的民族解放运动，支持一切有利于和平和进步事业的倡议和行动，而且愿意和一切国家在五项原则的基础上和平共处。然而，帝国主义、特别是世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义作尽坏事，帝国主义的仆从现代修正主义则拼命为他们的主子效劳。所以，必须提高警惕并坚决和他们进行针锋相对的斗争。罗士高说，中国人民为兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚已经取得的成就和光辉灿烂的前景而感到欢欣鼓舞。他说，马克思列宁主义的以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党坚决反对帝国主义，维护世界和平，高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，在反对现代修正主义、维护马列主义纯洁性的斗争中作出了重大的贡献，我们对这种英雄气概和高度的革命原则性表示衷心的敬佩。建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础之上的我们社会主义各国人民之间的友谊是牢不可破的。
    霍查在讲话中说，兄弟的中华人民共和国十一年来在经济和社会方面发生了深刻变化的原因是：由于中国共产党具有正确和创造性地执行马克思列宁主义原则的坚定性，由于中国共产党同劳动群众有着紧密联系，由于全中国人民对共产党及其列宁主义的中央委员会以及对人民和党的伟大儿子毛泽东同志怀着尊敬和热爱。天才的中国人民在胜利地进行社会主义建设中不断取得了十分巨大的成就，这也是由于中国共产党为保卫马克思列宁主义原则的纯洁性而进行正确的有原则性的毫不动摇的斗争，是由于它进行反对现代修正主义、反对其他任何有害的反马克思列宁主义的表现的斗争。中华人民共和国十一年来所取得的巨大胜利，使它成为一个巨大的世界强国，成为一个国际威望不断增长的和平和社会主义的坚定战士。
    霍查说，中国共产党的对外政策过去和现在都遵循着列宁主义的各国人民间和平和友好政策的最高原则，遵循着无产阶级国际主义的最高原则。这个拥有一千四百万党员的伟大而光荣的党是国际共产主义运动中的一支巨大力量，它同全世界所有共产党和工人党团结一致，并肩前进，高举着马克思列宁主义旗帜，使其不被沾污。作为社会主义阵营大家庭一员的伟大的中华人民共和国在国际上起着巨大和重要的作用。它不断为巩固和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结而斗争，并在全世界人民所进行的保卫和平、争取不同政治和社会制度的国家间和平共处原则的胜利、争取裁军和正确解决一切悬而未决的国际问题的斗争中作出了十分巨大的贡献。中国共产党和伟大的中国人民在革命的道路上正确地看待被压迫人民摆脱帝国主义和殖民主义者而求得的解放，并尽一切可能帮助他们获得民族解放。正是由于进行了这一正确的斗争，中华人民共和国不仅在亚洲，而且在全世界赢得了尊敬和同情。因此，侵略成性的帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义者及其忠实的仆从、可恶的南斯拉夫修正主义者极端无耻地进行造谣诬蔑，把中国说成是一个“不要和平、而要战争，不主张不同社会制度各国之间和平共处的国家”等等。但是，这些企图都是枉费心机的。霍查指出，嗜血成性的美帝国主义者为了破坏中国在国际上所不断赢得的同情和巨大影响，顽固地企图阻挠中国在联合国或其他国际组织中取得合法地位。让美帝国主义继续这样对待中华人民共和国也就是允许它攻击我们社会主义阵营最坚强的阵地。他说，美帝国主义反对中国的任何性质的尝试都将遭到社会主义阵营、全世界共产党人和全体进步人类的沉重打击。
    霍查说，必须无情地揭露美帝国主义者及其奴仆的疯狂备战活动，对他们及贝尔格莱德修正主义者必须在政治上和思想上给予无情的斗争和揭露，因为只有如此，才有助于真正的和平事业、我们曾经遵循这条道路，并且今后还将毫不动摇地遵循这条马列主义的道路。
    霍查接着说，阿尔巴尼亚人民同伟大的中国人民有着牢不可破的友谊，我国党和政府过去曾经支持、今后仍将竭尽全力支持中国的和平政策和它的国际权利。我国人民和党为有中国人民这样一个伟大和忠诚的朋友而感到高兴，并将尽一切力量来维护和日益发展我们两国兄弟人民之间的坚强的友谊，这种友谊是建筑在马列主义基础之上的。
    招待会充满了热烈友好的气氛。会间并由正在阿尔巴尼亚访问的中国四川歌舞团表演歌舞节目。
    我驻保大使的招待会
    新华社索非亚30日电　我国驻保加利亚大使朱其文今天晚间在此间举行了盛大招待会，庆祝中华人民共和国成立十一周年。
    保加利亚国民议会主席团主席加?夫、部长会议主席于哥夫和保加利亚党和政府其他领导人布尔加拉诺夫、米哈伊洛夫、斯塔伊科夫、拉·达米扬诺夫、迪莫夫、普拉霍夫、托多罗夫、日·日夫科夫、格奥尔基耶夫等出席了招待会。
    中国驻保加利亚大使朱其文和保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫在招待会上先后讲了话。
    朱其文大使在讲话中说：中国人民正在中国共产党和我们伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，高举着社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的胜利旗帜，意气风发地进行着忘我的劳动。
    他说：今年是在两年大跃进的基础上持续跃进的一年。目前，我国人民正以忘我劳动开展一个以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动，为完成和超额完成今年国民经济计划而奋斗。
    朱其文说，在我国进行社会主义建设的过程中，我们不断地得到苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家的帮助，对此，中国人民表示衷心感谢。
    在谈到中保两国人民间的兄弟友谊时，朱其文说：中保两国人民的兄弟友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的。这个友谊的发展有助于我们两国的社会主义建设，有助于壮大以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量。
    于哥夫接着讲话。他说，过去的十一年中，中华人民共和国在生活中发生了深刻的变化，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在社会、经济和文化生活的一切方面都取得了巨大成就。这些成就的获得是中国工人阶级、劳动农民和知识分子发挥了创造性的力量和才能的结果。于哥夫表示衷心祝贺中国人民取得的胜利，并且希望中国人民在伟大而神圣的马克思列宁主义旗帜下，在争取社会主义在自己的自由的祖国取得胜利的斗争中取得更大的成就。
    在谈到保加利亚和中国两国人民的友谊时，他说，我们相信，这友谊将一年比一年巩固和牢不可破，因为它的力量的永不枯竭的源泉是马克思列宁主义学说、无产阶级国际主义原则、我们共同的目标和走向社会主义和共产主义胜利的不可遏止的愿望；因为这友谊是在以强大的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民伟大友谊的幸福的太阳照耀下发展的。
    招待会是在友好热情的气氛中进行的。

    招待会在友好热烈的气氛中进行。何伟大使和范文同总理先后在招待会上讲了话。
    何伟大使在讲话中说，今天，全中国人民正以欢乐的心情回顾着已经取得的伟大胜利，同时也充满信心地展望着将来。他在提到我国在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的指导下所取得的建设成就之后说，我们十分满意地看到，在和平恢复后，勤劳勇敢的越南人民，在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，迅速恢复了受到长期殖民主义摧残和战争破坏的国民经济，又执行了发展和改造经济、发展文化的三年计划，社会主义改造和社会主义建设都取得了巨大的成就。越南民主共和国不但同亚非许多和平中立国家建立了友好关系，而且正在同更多爱好和平的国家发展友好关系。它为维护日内瓦协议的执行和印度支那地区的和平曾经作出了坚持不懈的努力。今天，越南的和平统一还没有得到实现，这是由于美帝国主义及其走狗一贯阻挠和破坏的结果。我们深信，越南人民和平统一祖国的愿望一定会实现，中国人民永远支持越南人民的正义斗争，直到他们取得最后的胜利。
    范文同总理接着讲话说，十一年来，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，中国人民在各个战线上取得了巨大的成就。越南人民感到欢欣鼓舞，把这些胜利看成是自己的胜利。
    范文同总理接着谈到，中华人民共和国是具有六亿五千万人口的社会主义国家，是一个爱好和平的强国，在全世界特别是在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲很有威信和有广泛的影响。它对加强以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，对世界人民为和平民主、民族独立和社会进步的斗争事业具有巨大贡献。他表示，必须恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位。他说，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府热烈支持伟大中华人民共和国的和平外交政策和这个政策所取得的成就。我们坚决支持中华人民共和国的建议——亚洲和太平洋地区各国之间签订互不侵犯和平公约并把这个地区变为无核武器地区。范文同总理指出，美帝国主义为了掩盖它们不可告人的阴谋，正在阴谋利用联合国的名义来干涉老挝。越南人民和越南民主共和国政府坚决反对美帝国主义及其附庸国干涉老挝的阴谋和行动，并且坚信，在世界爱好和平力量的支持下，老挝人民的正义斗争一定会取得胜利。
    范文同总理说，越南和中国是两个兄弟国家，一贯互相亲密团结和帮助。越南人民永远铭记着中国共产党、政府和人民曾经全力支持越南人民的救国抗战，为日内瓦协议的胜利和恢复越南的和平作出了积极的贡献，目前又从各方面慷慨地援助越南人民在北方进行社会主义建设，并坚决支持我们实行和平统一祖国的斗争。
    我驻德大使的招待会
    新华社柏林30日电　中国驻德意志民主共和国大使王国权今晚举行招待会，庆祝中华人民共和国成立十一周年。

    他说，中国人民一向珍视同社会主义各国人民的友好团结，并为不断增进中德两国人民的兄弟友谊、为巩固和发展社会主义阵营的伟大团结而作出最大努力。接着格罗提渥总理讲了话。他说，中国人民在久经战斗考验的中国共产党的领导下，在同整个社会主义阵营的巩固团结中，以忘我的劳动取得了中国社会主义建设的巨大成就。对此德意志民主共和国的劳动人民向你们祝贺并对中国人民所取得的成就表示钦佩。
    格罗提渥说，中华人民共和国遵循着不同社会制度国家和平共处的原则，执行着旨在与所有国家建立友好睦邻关系的外交政策。今天中华人民共和国和许多国家有着外交和贸易关系，并且和许多国家订立了协定和条约。然而，直到今天，世界上还有不愿意正视中华人民共和国在国际舞台上的重要作用的势力，这首先是以美国为首的某些西方国家企图阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利。格罗提渥说，在我们为制止西德军国主义而进行的斗争中，中华人民共和国是站在我们一边的。它一直为实现德国人民的正义要求而努力。接着他向中华人民共和国政府和全体兄弟的中国人民对这些团结的表现，表示德意志民主共和国政府和人民的最衷心的感谢。格罗提渥总理指出，我们两国之间的紧密的和兄弟般的关系在过去十一年当中有了不断的发展和巩固。他表示坚信，为了我们两国和整个社会主义阵营的利益，这种友好关系今后会得到进一步的发展。
  他最后请大家举杯，为伟大的中国人民和以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党，为中德人民之间不可摧毁的友谊，为以苏联为首的不可战胜的、强大的社会主义阵营，为全世界和平干杯。
