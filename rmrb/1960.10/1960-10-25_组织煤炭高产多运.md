    Organize Coal Production and Transport Efficiently

    Concentrating superior forces to organize a substantial increase in coal production; and properly managing mine transportation to promptly gather the increased coking coal to the railway and highway trunk lines and quickly transport it to iron and steel plants, is a vital measure to ensure increased iron and steel production.

    The equipment conditions of existing mines can be roughly divided into the following three categories: The first category includes mines with relatively good transportation conditions, with a fully connected transportation system above and below ground, railway branch lines directly reaching the mine, and complete coal storage warehouses and mechanized loading and unloading equipment, allowing for immediate transport as soon as production occurs; one ton mined is equivalent to one ton used. The second category includes mines with poorer transportation conditions, requiring a short distance transport from the mine to the railway or highway trunk line. The mine's ground and underground transportation, as well as mine hoisting and loading capacity are also weak. Therefore, the primary task of these mines is to seize the opportunity to transform transportation technology, expedite the laying of dedicated lines allocated to these mines by the state, strive to improve loading and unloading equipment, and endeavor to adapt transportation conditions to the requirements of production growth as quickly as possible. The third category includes mines with the worst transportation conditions, located far from railway or highway trunk lines, and with poor internal transportation conditions. These mines occupy a significant portion of the labor force, and while some of the coal produced can supply the local commune's production and livelihood needs, the majority cannot be transported due to inconvenient transportation, thus failing to realize its effectiveness. Therefore, by maximizing the production efficiency of the first category of mines, improving the production conditions of the second category, and streamlining the production layout of the third category, our coal production can advance rapidly along the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the domestic revolutionary war, we adopted the method of concentrating superior forces to fight battles of annihilation and won the victory of the war. Can we concentrate the main manpower and material resources on the coal production front to areas where production is urgently needed to organize high production and efficient transportation? We believe that it is not only possible but also necessary to reasonably adjust manpower and organize substantial increases in production on the coal production front. When the third category of mines occupies a large amount of labor force but cannot realize production efficiency, and the first category of mines needs to supplement the labor force, it is advisable to appropriately transfer manpower and material resources to the first category of mines to allow the production of these mines to grow rapidly and quickly transport the products to meet the needs of production and construction. Will this have an impact on overall production? From a local perspective, some minor mines have reduced their production scope or temporarily suspended production, which seems to have a slight impact on production. However, since the strength of the third category of mines is concentrated to the first category of mines, which plays a decisive role in production, the output of the first category of mines has increased exponentially, and in essence, the total coal output has increased substantially. The Hegang Xingshan Mine in Heilongjiang is a very obvious example. In August, this mine transferred the manpower and material resources of the third category of mines to the first category of mines, which made the daily output of this mine surge from 200 tons to 700 tons. Xingshan Mine stopped production in two third-category mines with a daily output of 100 tons in mid-August, and in mid-September, the output of the first-category mine increased by 10%, and the external transportation volume of coal increased by more than 2.3 million tons per day. Facts show that concentrating forces directly on coal mines with better equipment conditions will only increase production and will not have any adverse effects.

    Our advocacy of concentrating the main forces to organize a substantial increase in production in the first category of mines does not mean ignoring the production of the second and third categories of mines. While grasping the first category of mines, we must invest a part of our strength to pay attention to improving the production conditions of the second category of mines, vigorously carry out technological innovation, improve the hoisting capacity of these mines, improve ground and underground transportation, and improve the level of mechanized loading and unloading. At the same time, we must actively promote advanced experience in tunneling and mining, improve and improve production technology, and gradually raise the second category of mines to the level of the first category of mines. In addition to resolutely shutting down some of the third category of mines that have no prospects for development, for some of the mines that have prospects for development, we should also pay attention to creating conditions so that they can be transformed in a planned way in the future under the conditions of manpower and material resources to improve production capacity.

    To achieve a substantial increase in coal production, transportation work must keep up. The quality of transportation conditions has a decisive impact on the increase in production in mines. At present, some mines have great mining strength, but transportation cannot keep up, which often affects the continuation of production. Therefore, all coal mines with poor transportation conditions must put the transportation problem in an important position to solve it. We must hurry up and lay the mine dedicated lines and railway branch lines that the state plans to build, build the mine's ground transportation network, underground transportation, and mine hoisting, and closely link the above-ground and underground transportation with the railway branch lines; connect the mine dedicated lines, railway branch lines, and railway trunk lines. In this way, a large amount of coal can be transported to the production front in a timely manner, and a large number of ground transportation labor can be saved for underground production. This is a good thing that kills two birds with one stone.

    The fourth quarter of each year is a quarter with a relatively heavy transportation task. In order to produce more coal and transport it quickly, the coal industry sector must focus on transportation while focusing on production. We must ensure that transportation work meets the needs of production development, try our best to transport more, transport all the coal stored in the mines, resolutely complete the transportation task, and strive to exceed the transportation plan. In terms of transportation principles, we must first transport out of the province, then transport within the province, first transport key departments, then transport general departments, especially the transportation of coking coal must strive for every minute and every second. Only when transportation work catches up will the plan to substantially increase the production of coal and coke be more guaranteed. (Attached photo)

    The staff and workers of the coking workshop of the Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant have effectively reduced coal consumption by tightly controlling the links of washing coal, transporting coal, and coking in the production process. In September, while the quality of coke was improved and the output increased, more than 500 tons of raw coal were saved compared with the past. This is the seventeen-hole coke oven discharging coke.

### 组织煤炭高产多运

    组织煤炭高产多运
    集中优势兵力，组织煤炭大幅度增产；办好矿山交通运输，把增产的焦煤及时地汇集到铁路和公路干线上，并且迅速地运送到炼铁、炼钢厂去，这是保证钢铁增产的一项重要措施。
    现有矿井的设备情况大体可分为以下三类：一类是矿井的运输条件较好，井上井下有一套相互衔接的运输体系，铁路支线直达矿井，储煤仓、机械化装卸设备齐全，可以随产随运，采一吨就能顶上一吨用。另一类矿井，运输条件较差，从矿井到铁路、公路干线，还有一段短距离运输。矿内的地面和井下运输以及矿井提升、装卸力量也弱。因此，这类矿井的首要任务就是抓紧运输技术的改造，尽快地把国家分配给这些矿井的专用线铺好，努力改进装卸设备，力求尽快地使运输条件适应于生产增长的要求。再一类矿井，运输条件最差，矿井的位置离开铁路、公路干线很远，矿井内部的运输条件也差。这类矿井，占用了相当大的一部分劳动力，生产的煤炭除了有部分可以供应当地公社生产和生活需用而外，其余大部分因为交通不便，运不出来，不能发挥它的效能。因此，发挥第一类矿的生产效能，改进第二类矿的生产条件，整顿第三类矿的生产布局，我们的煤炭生产就可以循着多、快、好、省的总路线飞速前进。
    在抗日战争和国内革命战争期间，我们采取了集中优势兵力打歼灭战的方法，夺取了战争的胜利。在煤炭生产战线上能不能集中主要人力、物力，到生产迫切需要的重点上去，组织高产多运呢？我们认为在煤炭生产战线上合理地调整人力，组织大幅度增产不仅是可能的也是必要的。当着第三类矿井占有大量劳力不能发挥生产效能，而第一类矿井又需补充劳动力的时候，就不妨适当地把人力，物力调到第一类矿井去，让这类矿井的生产迅速增长上去，并且把产品迅速调运出来，以满足生产建设的需要。这样做，对于整个生产会不会有影响呢？从局部来看，一些次要的矿井缩小了生产范围或者暂时停止了生产，似乎生产受到了一点影响。但是，由于集中了第三类井的力量到对生产起决定作用的第一类矿井去，使一类井的产量成倍的提高，实质上总的煤炭产量大幅度增长了。黑龙江鹤岗兴山矿就是一个很明显的例子。这个矿在8月份把第三类井的人力、物力抽到第一类井去，使这个井的日产量由二百吨猛增到七百吨。兴山矿在8月中旬停产了两个日产百吨的三类矿井，9月中旬一类井的产量就上升了10％，煤炭外运量每日增加二百三十多万吨。事实表明：集中力量直接用于设备条件较好的煤矿，总的说，只会增产，不会有什么不好的影响。
    我们主张集中主要力量组织第一类矿井的大幅度增产，丝毫也不是意味着不管第二、三类井的生产。我们在抓第一类矿井的同时，一定要投入一部力量注意改进第二类矿井的生产条件，大搞技术革新，提高这类矿井的提升能力，改进井上地面运输和井下运输，提高装卸机械化水平。同时，在掘进、回采上积极推广先进经验，改进和提高生产技术，使第二类矿井逐步提高到第一类井的水平。对第三类矿井除了一些确实没有发展前途的要坚决停产一批外，对于一些有发展前途的矿井，还应该注意创造条件，以便今后在人力、物力许可的条件下，有计划地加以改造，提高生产能力。
    要使煤炭大幅度增产，运输工作一定要努力跟上去。运输条件的好坏，对矿井的增产有着决定性的影响。现在，有一些矿井的采掘力量很大，只是运输还赶不上去，常常会影响生产继续进行。因此，一切运输条件较差的煤矿，必须把运输问题放在重要地位来解决。要赶快把国家计划修建的矿井专用线、铁路支线铺设起来，把矿山的地面运输网、井下运输和矿井提升修建好，使井上井下的运输和铁路支线密切联系起来；使矿井专用线、铁路支线和铁路干线衔接起来。这样，可以使大量煤炭及时运到生产前线去，可以节省出大批地面运输劳力用于井下生产。真是一举两得的好事。
    每年第四季度是运输任务比较繁重的季度，为了多产煤炭，快速调运，煤炭工业部门在狠抓生产的同时必须狠抓运输。务使运输工作适应生产发展的需要，要尽量做到多运，要把矿井中的存煤全部运出来，坚决完成运输任务，力争超过运输计划。在运输原则上必须做到先运省外的，后运省内的，先运重点部门的，后运一般部门的，特别是焦煤运输必须做到分两必争。只有运输工作赶上去了，大幅度增产煤焦的计划才会更有保证。（附图片）
    广州钢铁厂焦化车间职工在洗煤、运煤、炼焦的生产流程中，环环把紧节约关，有效地降低了煤耗。九月份在焦炭质量提高、产量增长的同时，比过去节约原煤五百吨以上。这是十七孔焦炉正在出焦。
