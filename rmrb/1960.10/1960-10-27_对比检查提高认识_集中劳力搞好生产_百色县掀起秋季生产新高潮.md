    Comparison and Inspection Enhance Understanding; Concentrate Labor to Improve Production
    Bose County Launches a New Upsurge in Autumn Production
    Nanning, October 26th (People's Daily) – Communes in Bose County, Guangxi, have inspected current agricultural production, powerfully promoting a new upsurge centered on field management and autumn planting.
    Following a production inspection by the County Party Committee in September, communes in Bose County immediately began a comprehensive production inspection. During the inspection, the Yangxu Commune Party Committee discovered that the Babu and Baibei production brigades, located across a gully from each other, had completely identical natural conditions, but the growth of their rice seedlings was vastly different. In Baibei brigade, the rice seedlings were lush and green, tall and large. In Babu brigade, the rice seedlings were sparse, so sparse that a small basket placed among the seedlings wouldn’t even touch them. The Commune Party Committee held an overnight Party branch meeting in Babu brigade to identify the reasons for the poor production. It was found that only 60% of the total labor force in this brigade was engaged in agricultural production. The opposite was true for Baibei brigade, where 80% of the labor force was invested in agricultural production during the busy season, and the cadres' work style was more thorough. To further promote current production, the Yangxu Commune Party Committee introduced the situations of the Babu and Baibei brigades at a commune-wide cadre meeting, calling on all production teams to conduct a major comparison, promptly inspect, identify the reasons, and make timely improvements.
    The Bose County Party Committee considered the approach of Yangxu Commune to be very good and decided to carry out a general comparison and inspection of current agricultural production among the communes, brigades, and teams. Through inspection and comparison, the communes generally found that there was a shortage of labor on the front lines and that non-agricultural production was occupying too much labor. The communes immediately conducted a comprehensive inventory of labor, transferring the excessive labor force occupied by non-agricultural production departments to the agricultural front lines. The Sitang Commune converted all ninety-five stoves in the commune's canteens into continuous stoves, changed the method of grinding rice from main labor to animal power or semi-labor, abolished the canteen firewood special team, and adopted the method of concentrated firewood gathering on holidays, stipulating that canteen accountants should also participate in canteen labor in addition to bookkeeping. After taking these measures, the number of logistics personnel in the commune was reduced from six hundred and eighty-three to four hundred and forty-six. Currently, the number of people engaged in agricultural production in the entire commune accounts for 81% of the total labor force.
    Through this major inspection, the labor force engaged in agricultural production in the county increased from 25,818 to 30,757, accounting for 80.9% of the total labor force. To strengthen the front lines of production, 868 people were transferred from county-level agencies, communes, and brigades. After taking these measures, Bose County immediately formed a high tide of expanding the planting of late-autumn crops in a concentrated campaign. At present, while doing a good job in field management with fertilizer as the key link, the communes are vigorously expanding the planting of late sweet potatoes and buckwheat, and have successfully completed the expansion plan. Post-management of summer-planted crops and autumn planting work are now in full swing.

    对比检查提高认识　集中劳力搞好生产
    百色县掀起秋季生产新高潮
    本报南宁26日电　广西百色县各公社检查了当前农业生产，有力地促进了以田间管理和秋种为中心的新高潮。
    9月份县委检查生产之后，百色县各公社随即开始全面性的生产大检查。阳圩公社党委在检查中，发现地处一沟之隔的巴部大队和百背大队，自然条件完全一样，但是禾苗生长情况却大不相同。百背大队的禾苗一片油绿，又高又大。巴部大队的禾苗很稀，在苗中间放一个小箩筐还伤不到秧。公社党委连夜在巴部大队召开党支部大会，找出生产差的原因，在于这个大队用于搞农业生产的劳力只达到总劳动力的60％。百背大队则完全相反，农忙时80％的劳动力投入农业生产，干部工作作风也比较深入。阳圩公社党委为进一步促进当前生产，在全公社的干部大会上，介绍了巴部和百背两个大队的情况，号召各生产队进行大评比，及时检查、找出原因、及时改进。
    中共百色县委认为阳圩公社的做法很好，决定在各公社、大队和小队之间普遍开展当前农业生产的大评比大检查。各公社通过检查评比，普遍发现第一线的劳动力不足，非农业生产占用的劳动力多了一些。各公社立即进行劳动力大盘点，把非农业生产部门过多占用的劳动力投入农业第一线。四塘公社把全社九十五个食堂的灶都改为连环灶，由主要劳动力磨米改为畜力或半劳动力磨米，取消了食堂打柴专业队，采取假日突击拾柴的办法，规定食堂会计除了记账还要参加食堂劳动。采取这些措施后，全社后勤人员由六百八十三人减少为四百四十六人。目前，全公社投入农业生产的人已占总劳动力的81％。
    经过这次大检查，全县投入农业生产的劳动力由二万五千八百十八人增加到三万零七百五十七人，占总劳动力的80.9％。为了加强生产第一线，百色县直机关、公社、大队共下放了八百六十八人。百色县在采取这些措施后，全县立即形成扩种晚秋作物突击运动的高潮。目前各公社在搞好以肥为纲的田间管理的同时，大力扩种晚甘薯和三角麦，胜利地完成了扩种计划。现在夏种作物后期管理和秋种工作正紧张进行。
