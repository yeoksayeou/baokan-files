(Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 8th) The second group of the simple No. 2 furnace section of the coking workshop of Banshan Steel Plant in Zhejiang Province, in the upsurge of carrying out the competition of "production red shift after shift, red day after day," strengthened collaboration between three shifts of workers, cooperated with each other, and the previous shift actively created conditions for the next shift's production, which strongly promoted the high-quality and high-yield of coke. The output in August increased by more than five times compared with July, and September increased by 10.79% compared with August.

This group has two simple coke ovens, including six production shifts. In the increase production and practice economy competition, in order to ensure that the group's production plan is "red day after day, red shift after shift," this group decided to strengthen the collaboration and cooperation between the upper and lower shifts, according to the characteristics of continuous coke oven production. Changing the daily output calculated by shift to calculated by furnace, the three shifts are jointly responsible for one day's production and a set of handover system has been established.

Through the establishment of the handover system, all production shifts and production workers and auxiliary workers in each link of the group clarified the close relationship between doing a good job of the three-shift collaboration and completing the group's production plan. Everyone not only cares about the production of their own shift, but also cares about the production of the next shift and the whole group. For example, Shift A workers take measures to produce more coke in the first four hours, completing more than two-thirds of the shift plan; produce less coke in the last four hours, maintaining the furnace temperature above 900 degrees, and do a good job of "three diligences" (diligently clear ash, diligently remove slag, diligently add coal), to achieve a vigorous fire handover, so that Shift B can achieve high temperature and high yield as soon as they take over. Shift B also takes the same method to create conditions for the next shift to achieve high quality and high yield. All types of work have also promoted the communist spirit of cooperation, doing a good job of preparation work for the next shift. This group also took comparing who performed the collaboration well, comparing who had higher furnace temperatures, comparing who got more heat from the original coal, and comparing who operated better as the content, carried out collaboration competitions between shifts and between types of work, and checked and compared them at the weekly meetings. This has further prompted everyone to strive to do a good job in their own shift while also striving to create better conditions for the next shift. In the high-quality and high-yield competition among various groups in the workshop, this group has successively won the rotating championship red flag in August and September.

    半山钢铁厂二号焦炉二组班班优质高产
    按炉计算产量  三班共同负责
    本报杭州8日电　浙江省半山钢铁厂焦化车间简易二号炉工段第二组，在开展生产班班红、日日红的竞赛热潮中，三班工人加强协作，互相配合，上一班积极为下一班生产创造条件，有力地促进焦炭优质高产。8月份比7月份产量提高了五倍多，9月份又比8月份提高了10.79％。
    这个组共有两座简易焦炉，包括六个生产班。在增产节约竞赛中，这个组为了确保全组生产计划日日红、班班红，根据焦炉生产连续性强的特点，决定加强上、下班的协作配合。将日产量按班计算改为按炉计算，三班对一天的生产共同负责，并订出了一套交接班制度。
    通过建立交接班制度，全组各个生产班和各个环节的生产工人，辅助工人，都明确了搞好三班协作与完成全组生产计划的密切关系，每个人不但关心本班生产，而且关心下一班和全组的生产。如甲班工人采取前四小时多出焦，完成班计划三分之二以上；后四小时少出焦，保持炉温九百度以上，并做好三勤（勤通灰、勤出渣、勤加煤），实现旺火交班，使乙班一接班就能实现高温多产。而乙班也采取同样办法，为下一班优质高产创造条件。各个工种也都发扬了共产主义协作精神，互为下班做好准备工作。这个组还以比执行协作好、比炉温高、比原煤顶热得多、比操作好为内容，开展班与班、工种与工种的协作竞赛，并在每周的碰头会上检查评比。这样就更促使大家在力争做好本班工作的同时，也力争为下班创造更好的条件。在车间各组优质高产竞赛中，这个组8、9两个月连续获得了循环优胜红旗。
