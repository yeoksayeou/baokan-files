(People's Daily report) The La Gao Production Team of Pinghu Commune, Dushan County, Guizhou Province, carried the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy through the autumn harvest work, insisted on collecting all, cleaning up, and being thorough. In just four days, the entire team increased its harvest by more than 10,000 catties of grain due to careful harvesting and meticulous threshing. The Qiannan Prefecture Committee of the Chinese Communist Party required all people's communes and production teams in the prefecture to learn from the experience of the La Gao Team in the autumn harvest clean-up work, and strive for as much autumn harvest as possible.

On September 26, four of the ten production teams in La Gao Team, including Wangjiazhai and Pingzhai, basically completed the autumn harvest tasks including main grains, miscellaneous grains, and economic crops such as green hemp, except for late-maturing sweet potatoes and buckwheat, and even collected by-products such as grain straw, bean leaves, and corn stalks. At this time, the entire team also completed about 90% of the harvestable crops. At this time, the autumn harvest clean-up work of each team suddenly slowed down. What was the reason?

In order to strive for a complete and clean autumn grain harvest, Party Branch Secretary Zhang Zhenghua and the resident cadre, Deputy Director of the Commune Wang Kaihua, went to the La Zao and other teams with slower autumn harvest progress to understand the situation. They found that scattered small plots of poorly grown crops on the top of the slope and at the back of the ditch had not been harvested. Zhang Zhenghua and Wang Kaihua asked commune member Zhang Zhengkun why that plot of millet was not harvested. Zhang Zhengkun said: "The millet grows like 'ghost incense,' and the road is far away, so there is no time to harvest it." After a detailed discussion, Zhang Zhengkun added: The team uses labor quotas for scoring, and gets rewards for exceeding the quota. The crops in the large fields are good, the harvest is fast, and the quota is exceeded more; the road here is far, the plots are scattered, and the mountains are rugged, the crops do not grow well, it is labor-intensive, and the amount of harvest is small, so there is no reward for exceeding the quota. Therefore, commune members would rather crowd in the large fields than go to remote places to harvest. After leaving the La Zao team, they came to the Xia La Gao and other four teams that were reportedly basically completed. Here, on the top of the mountains and by the ditches, next to the villages and at the corners of the land, not only was the harvest not clean, but also grain was scattered on the drying ground. In particular, the crops on the "five sides and four edges" were not harvested. The cadres and commune members of these teams were still unclear whether these crops should be used as a family property for the cafeteria or put into the collective warehouse of the production team, so they have been delaying the harvesting. After Zhang Zhenghua and Wang Kaihua learned about these situations, they understood the situation. That night, the La Gao Team Party Branch held an expanded meeting including team cadres, work group leaders, temporary threshing group leaders, and Party members, League members, and activists, and revised the method of calculating and rewarding labor quotas during the autumn harvest clean-up period to a method of contracting work to groups for calculation and reward; once again clarified that the crops planted by the original teams on the "five sides and four edges" and at the corners of the fields should be handled strictly in accordance with the Party's autumn harvest policy, and all should be used as family property for the team cafeteria. After the Party Branch's opinions were implemented, they were warmly supported by the majority of commune members. Each team arranged a portion of labor to insist on autumn harvest clean-up work, and each temporary work group and contract group formulated a series of practical and feasible measures for rushing to harvest and clean up according to the actual situation of their own autumn harvest. The teams that originally thought the autumn harvest was "completed" also re-threshed twice, thoroughly cleaned the drying ground, collected the scattered grain, and harvested the originally missed and unplanned crops according to the Party Branch's opinions. Everyone said that there was still a lot of "profit" in their team's autumn harvest clean-up. In this way, a vigorous "collect all, clean up, and make a good start and finish" autumn harvest clean-up upsurge was launched in each team. According to the statistics of the ten teams of the La Gao Production Team, by September 30, the campaign to increase production and practice economy by collecting all and cleaning up the autumn harvest, from re-threshing twice, carefully cleaning the drying ground, collecting scattered grain, and collecting the originally missed and unplanned crops, increased by 11,632 catties of grain, accounting for 1.6% of the total grain output of the team; the recovered grain straw, bean leaves, corn stalks and other agricultural and sideline products that can be used as feed are enough for all 250 livestock in the team to eat until next summer.

    秋收要善始善终
    拉高生产队开展收全收净运动做好扫尾工作
    多收粮食一万多斤，多收的谷草豆叶足够全队牲畜吃到明年夏季
    本报讯　贵州独山县平湖公社拉高生产队，把增产节约精神贯穿到秋收工作中，坚持收全收净收彻底。全队在短短四天中，因为精收细打增收了一万多斤粮食。中共黔南州委要求全州各地人民公社生产队，在秋收扫尾工作中学习拉高队的经验，力争秋收多多益善。
    9月26日，拉高队十个生产小队中，王家寨、平寨等四个小队，除晚熟甘薯、荞子外，基本完成了包括主粮、杂粮和青麻等经济作物在内的秋收任务，连谷草、豆叶、玉米秆等副产品都收了回来。这时，全队也完成了应收作物收割量的90％左右。就在这个时候，各小队的秋收扫尾工作突然慢了下来，原因到底在哪里呢？
    为了力争秋粮收全收净，党支书记张正华和驻队干部、公社副社长王开华，到秋收进度比较慢的拉早等小队，了解情况。他们发现坡顶、背槽等零星小块长得不好的庄稼，一直无人收割。张正华和王开华问社员张正坤，那块谷子为什么不收？张正坤说：“谷子长得像
  ‘鬼烧香’，路又远，哪得空去收。”经过细谈，张正坤又说：队里是按劳动定额评分，超过定额得奖，大田大地庄稼好，收得快，突破定额多；这里路远、地块零星、山??里，庄稼长得不好，费工大收得的数量少，得不到超定额奖励，所以社员宁愿在大田里挤，不愿去边远处收。他们离开拉早小队，来到据汇报说是已经基本收完的下拉高等四个小队。这里山顶沟边，寨旁土角，房前屋后，不但没有收干净，而且晒坝上还抛撒了粮食。特别是五旁四坎上的庄稼也没有收。这些小队的干部和社员还弄不清这些庄稼究竟是归食堂作家底，还是入生产队集体仓，所以把收割的事一直拖了下来。张正华和王开华了解到这些情况后，心里亮堂了。当晚拉高队党支部就召开了包括小队干部、作业组长、临时性的挞谷小组组长和党团员、积极分子在内的扩大会议，修改了在秋收扫尾时期，由按劳动定额计酬奖励的办法，为分片包工计酬评奖的办法；再次明确了原来小队种的五旁四坎、田边土角的庄稼，坚决按照党的秋收政策办事，通通归小队食堂作家底。党支部的意见贯彻下去以后，得到了广大社员的热烈拥护。各个小队，都安排了一部分劳力坚持秋收扫尾工作，各临时作业组、包工组，都根据自己秋收的实际情况，订出了一系列切实可行的抢收扫尾措施。原来认为秋收已经“完成”的小队，又根据党支部意见，复打二道、全收精收五旁四坎、??角角，大家都说自己队秋收扫尾还大有“油水”。这样一来，轰轰烈烈的“收全收净，善始善终”的秋收扫尾高潮，在各个小队开展起来。据拉高生产队十个小队统计，到9月30日止，开展秋收收全收净的增产节约运动，从复打二道、精扫晒坝、收拣抛撒以及把原来漏收和不打算收的收起来后，就增加了一万一千六百三十二斤粮食，占全队粮食总产量1.6％；收回来的谷草、豆叶、包谷秆等农副产品，能作饲料的足够全队二百五十多头牲畜吃到明年夏天。（附图片）
