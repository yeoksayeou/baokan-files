    The Old Director Beloved by the Masses

    A Meeting of the Commune Committee
    On Sunday, the members of the Fengzhuxiang Production Brigade of the Guozhuangzi People's Commune in Tianjin were happily enjoying their holiday. On this day, several gray-haired old women walked towards the office of the Fourth Branch, chatting as they went. Before they even entered the office, an old woman in her fifties, with greying hair, walked up to them and warmly greeted them: "How are you all? Is work at home busy enough?" Everyone saw that it was Director Gu Niang. An old woman, about the same age as Gu Niang, approached her and said affectionately, "It's your day off, why didn't you go home to rest first? Aren't you afraid of wearing your old bones out?" Gu Niang took her hand and said as they walked, "It's alright. I can't stand being idle. I'd rather listen to our meeting, and in a while, I have to rush back to the training class." Gu Niang's original name was Li Xiuying, but because her husband's family name was Gu, people respectfully called her Gu Niang. She is currently studying at the Commune Cadre Training Class held by the Provincial Party Committee. Today, she took advantage of the holiday to come back specifically to attend the weekly meeting of the Commune Committee.

    The meeting of the Commune Committee began. The twelve committee members, all middle-aged women in their forties and fifties, filled the small office to capacity. The committee members in charge of production, livelihood, culture, education, hygiene, finance, and other tasks, reported on the progress of their work over the past week and the problems that existed. Gu Niang happily listened to each person's speech, thinking to herself, these old women are really meticulous and thoughtful in arranging their work. … The Commune Committee meeting adjourned. On the way back to the training class, Gu Niang pondered: These old women at home are becoming more and more capable. Thinking of this, she laughed to herself. I'm the same, aren't I! If it weren't for the Party's constant cultivation, what could I have done?

    Under the Nurturing of the Party
    Speaking of the Party's cultivation, not only Gu Niang, but each of these dozen or so women have a lot to say. They know why they have become leading cadres of the branch from ordinary housewives. Gu Niang has said more than once when talking with everyone, "How much ability do we housewives and old women have? If it weren't for the Party leading us step by step, wouldn't we still be spinning around the stove?" Now, the branch led by these dozen or so old women has become an advanced unit in the city. They have arranged the production and life of more than 3,000 households and more than 13,000 people in the entire branch in an orderly manner. But none of them have forgotten that a few years ago, they couldn't even handle the affairs of a few households. Gu Niang is a typical example of them. When she first joined the street work, she was responsible for the residential work of a lane. At that time, Gu Niang thought: I don't know a single character, and I can't speak well, so I might as well do some work. She started by doing sanitation work in the lane, but despite being busy from morning till night, the sanitation work in the lane never improved, and the old lady became somewhat discouraged. After the street organization saw this situation, it patiently told Gu Niang that relying on one person alone would not work, and that she should find ways to mobilize everyone. When Gu Niang heard about "mobilizing everyone," she was frightened from the bottom of her heart. In order to help Gu Niang carry out her work, the director of the street office not only frequently introduced the Party's policies to Gu Niang, but also patiently told her the methods of doing mass work over and over again. Sometimes, when a mass meeting was held, the street director would discuss with her in advance how to hold it and what to talk about. Then, he would sit next to her and watch her convene the meeting and speak, and finally tell her what was right and what was wrong. In this way, Gu Niang gradually learned to do mass work, and she spoke logically. When the large-scale people-run industry was launched in 1958, Gu Niang, with the specific help of the Party committee, accepted the task of organizing housewives to participate in production. At first, she was not confident, thinking that relying on a few old women, how could they run a factory? The Party committee secretary told her: We must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and think about yourself, you will know that the broad masses of women can definitely be mobilized. The more Gu Niang thought about it, the more she felt it was right, and she immediately increased her confidence, discussing and finding ways with activists from door to door, and quickly established the first spinning group. As soon as the first street production group was established, it attracted a large number of housewives like a magnet, and the next day, more than fifty women came to Gu Niang asking to participate in production. Gu Niang secretly remembered in her heart: Listening to the Party will never be wrong.

    Two Best Magic Weapons
    In September of 1958, the Guozhuangzi People's Commune was officially established. The work became more and more complex, and the requirements became more and more detailed, so Gu Niang felt more and more that she could not do without the Party's education and help. Whenever she encountered difficulties, she would immediately hear the Party's voice. Several secretaries of the commune Party committee often gave her specific help. Just after Gu Niang organized some production stalls, the Party committee put forward the call to organize "full sky stars" small-scale production. Gu Niang went back to calculate, and found that basically everyone who could participate in labor had already come out, so where could she find more labor? Just as she was feeling difficult, Tang Baoyuan, the secretary of the commune Party committee, came to her. "Secretary Tang, our labor force has become a problem." "Is there no potential at all?" "70% of those who can come have come out to work." "What about the remaining 30%?" Secretary Tang patiently told Gu Niang that some people could not come out to participate in labor because of a lot of specific difficulties such as children and cooking. Gu Niang immediately understood after hearing this, and she said, "Secretary Tang, wait for my report in a few days!" Then, Gu Niang mobilized the masses to come up with ideas and find solutions, and personally visited each household. In less than a month, the Party committee received a good news report from the Fourth Branch: seven new small commodity production groups had been established, and five small canteens had been established. In this way, under the specific cultivation of the Party committee, Gu Niang learned the working methods of comprehensively leading production and life step by step. She also often told everyone that to do a good job, the Party has given us two best magic weapons: one is to listen to the Party, and the other is to believe in the masses.

    "Listening to the Party" is not only a heartfelt saying that Gu Niang often says, but also became her guide for work. The Party committee put forward the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily, and the dozen or so old women in this branch kept it in mind all the time. They made do with whatever was available, and did everything from participating in production to transporting materials, building houses, moving bricks, and transporting soil by themselves. In the first half of this year alone, they saved more than 500 yuan in transportation costs. Under the leadership of Gu Niang and the others, diligence and thrift have become a trend throughout the branch. This branch has accumulated more than 670,000 yuan of funds in the past two years, accounting for 48% of the total accumulation of the commune. Once, Gu Niang and Yuan Niang heard that individual cadres in the packaging factory were starting to show signs of being wealthy: they were buying things, and they were not as careful in the storage of materials as they used to be. The old sisters immediately came to the factory to educate everyone with one analogy after another. "Just like living a life, a rich life can be lived frugally and get better and better, but a poor life can be lived lavishly, and it will become more and more difficult." Speaking of this, Gu Niang touched the wall beside her and said: Remember, when we built this house a year ago, we didn't even have a trowel, didn't we build it up with mud by hand!? No one said anything, but they had a common idea in their hearts: they must not let Gu Niang and Yuan Niang speak in vain.

    Glorious Days
    September 28th of last year became an unforgettable day for Gu Niang. She gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. The first secretary of the commune Party committee held her hands tightly, and Gu Niang, who was over half a century old, had tears in her eyes. She couldn't say a word, but she had only one idea, to work better for the Party in the second half of her life. This is no longer just Gu Niang's determination alone. Under the nurturing of the Party, the women of the Fourth Branch have grown rapidly. Yuan Niang, Su Niang, and others, who were also vice directors, have joined the Communist Party one after another. Now, among the twelve members of the branch committee, six are already Communist Party members. After they joined the Party, their desire for knowledge became even stronger, and everyone studied eagerly. Everyone took turns participating in the study of the commune Party school training class, earnestly studying the basic knowledge of the Party, Chairman Mao's works, and the Party's relevant policies. Everyone's ideological field became richer. Whenever they had time, the old women would gather together to discuss what they had learned, from the development of the Party to the Party's ultimate goal—communism. Gu Niang's enthusiasm for learning was even greater than others. Every night, she first thought about the work for the next day, and then sat under the lamp to study "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" attentively… She chewed on the words one by one, and if she didn't understand or couldn't see clearly, she would write it down, and then ask others the next day. In order to improve her political theory level in a planned way, Gu Niang also formulated a study system with everyone. Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday morning, the committee members would gather together to study or discuss for an hour. As the water rises, so does the boat. Gu Niang and other committee members also demanded more and more strictness in their work. Wherever there were difficulties, they took the lead to go there. On a dark night with pouring rain, in order to prevent the wood from getting wet and deformed, several directors lit a fire and baked the wood piece by piece all night long. They used practical actions to educate the broad masses of commune members. The commune members also respected and loved their directors more and more. As long as the directors asked them to do something, everyone rushed to do it. (Attached picture)

    群众爱戴的老社长
    本报记者　李正杰　阎晶昌
    一次社委会议
    星期日，天津市郭庄子人民公社风竹巷的社员们都在愉快地欢度假日。这天几位头发斑白的老大娘边说边走向第四分社办公室。还没等大家走进办公室，迎面走来的一位五十多岁的老大娘亲热地喊着：“你们可好哇，咱家里工作够忙吧？”大家一看是社长古娘。一位年纪和古娘相仿佛的老大娘凑近她身边亲切地说：“大礼拜的也不先回家休息一下，不怕把你老婆子累垮了？”古娘拉着她的手和大家边走边说：“不碍事。我呆也呆不惯，倒不如听听咱的会，一会我还得赶回训练班去呢。”古娘原名李秀英，因为婆家姓古，人们也就尊称她为古娘。现在她正在省委举办的公社干部训练班学习。今天利用假日特意赶来参加一周一次的社委会议。
    社委会议开始了。十二名四、五十岁的大娘——社委委员们，把这间不大的办公室坐得满满的，分管生产、生活、文教、卫生、财务等工作的委员，一一汇报了一周来工作的进展情况和存在的问题。古娘高兴地听着每个人的发言，心里想，这几个老婆子把工作安排得可真够细致周到的。……社委会散了。古娘在回训练班的路上边走边琢磨着：家里这些老婆子可越来越能干了，想到这里，她自己也笑了。我这个老婆子也一样么！要不是党一个劲的培养，能干些什么呢？
    在党的哺育下
    提起党的培养，不光是古娘，这十几个大娘个个都有一肚子心里话。她们知道自己为什么会由一个普通的家庭妇女，成了分社的领导干部。古娘在和大家谈心的时候就不止一次地说过：“咱们这些家庭妇女、老婆子有多大的能耐呢？要不是党领着咱们一步一步地走，还不是围着锅台打转转。”现在，由这十几个老大娘领导的分社已经成为全市的先进单位了，她们把整个分社三千多户人家、一万三千多人的生产、生活安排得井井有条。可是她们谁也没忘记，几年前她们连几户人家的事都办不了，古娘就是她们当中的一个典型例子。她刚参加街道工作的时候，负责一个胡同的居民工作。当时古娘就想：自己一个大字不识，又不会说不会道的，干脆还是动手干些活。开始就只搞些胡同的卫生工作，可是尽管她从早忙到晚，胡同的卫生工作却总不见起色，老太太有些灰心了。街道组织见到这种情况以后，就耐心地告诉古娘，光靠一个人不行呀，应该想办法把大家都发动起来。古娘一听说“发动大家”，从心眼里就发怵。为了帮助古娘开展工作，街道办事处的主任除了经常向古娘介绍党的方针政策以外，还耐心地一遍又一遍地告诉她做群众工作的方法，有时召开一个群众会，街主任就和她事先研究好怎么开法，讲些什么。然后坐在旁边，看她怎么召集，怎么讲，最后再告诉她哪点对哪点不对。就这样，古娘逐渐地学会了做群众工作了，讲起话来也有条有理了。等到1958年大搞民办工业的时候，古娘在党委的具体帮助下，接受了组织家庭妇女参加生产的任务。开始，她信心不高，觉得靠几个老婆子，怎能把工厂办起来呢？党委书记告诉她：一定要相信群众，依靠群众，想想你自己就会知道，广大妇女一定能够发动起来的。古娘越想越对，马上增加了信心，挨门挨户与积极分子商量想办法，很快建立起第一个纺线组。第一个街道生产组刚一成立，就像磁石一样吸引着广大家庭妇女，转天又有五十多个妇女找古娘要求参加生产。古娘在心里暗暗地记下了：听党的话永远不会错。
    两件最好的法宝
    1958年的9月，郭庄子人民公社正式成立了。工作越来越复杂，要求也越来越细致了，古娘也就越来越感到离不开党的教育和帮助了。每当她遇到困难的时候，马上就会听到党的声音。公社党委几个书记，经常对她进行具体帮助。就在古娘组织起一些生产摊子以后，党委又提出了组织满天星的小型生产的号召，古娘回去一算计，能参加劳动的基本上都出来了，上哪儿再找劳动力去呢？正在她犯难的时候，公社党委书记唐宝元找她来了。“唐书记，我们这劳动力可成了问题了。”“一点潜力也没有了吗？”“70％能来的都出来劳动了。”“剩下的那30％呢？”唐书记耐心地告诉古娘，有些人不能出来参加劳动，是因为有孩子问题、做饭问题等一大堆具体困难。古娘听后立刻明白了，她说：“唐书记，过几天你等着听汇报吧！”接着，古娘一面发动群众出主意，想办法，一面就亲自到各家各户进行访问。不到一个月的时间，党委就收到四分社一份报喜书：新建立了七个小商品生产组，成立了五个小食堂。就这样，古娘在党委的具体培养下，一个脚印一步地学会了全面领导生产、生活的工作方法。她也经常和大家说，要做好工作，党给了咱们两件最好的法宝：一听党的话，二相信群众。
    “听党的话”不仅是古娘经常挂在嘴边上的一句语重心长的话，而且成了她工作的指南。党委提出勤俭办社的方针，这个分社的十几个老大娘就时时刻刻记在心头，她们因陋就简，自己动手从参加生产到运料、盖房、搬砖、运土，无所不干，今年上半年光运输费就节约了五百多元。在古娘她们的带动下，勤俭已成为整个分社的一种风气了。这个分社两年来已经积累了资金六十七万多元，占公社总积累的48％。有一次，古娘和袁娘听说包装厂的个别干部开始露出家大业大的苗头：置起东西来了，材料保管也不像过去那么精心了，老姐妹俩就立即来到工厂向大家左一个比喻右一个比喻地进行教育。“像过日子一样，富日子穷过越过越好过，可穷日子富过，那就越过越难过了嘛。”说到这里，古娘又摸着身边的墙壁说：还记得吧，一年前咱们盖这间房子的时候，连把抹子都没有，不是一手泥一手泥垛起来的吗！？大家谁也没有说什么，可心里却有一个共同的想法：决不让古娘和袁娘白说。
    光荣的日子
    去年9月28日这一天，成为古娘终生难忘的日子，她光荣地加入了中国共产党。公社党委第一书记紧紧握着她的双手，年过半百的古娘，眼圈里湿润了，她一句话也说不出来，只有一个想法，后半辈子要更好地为党工作。这已经不仅仅是古娘一个人的决心了，在党的哺育下，四分社的大娘们都迅速地成长了起来，紧跟着副社长袁娘、苏娘等也都相继加入了共产党。现在，在分社的十二个社委当中，已经有六个人是共产党员了。她们入党以后，求知的欲望更加强烈了，每个人都如饥如渴地学习着，大家都轮流参加了公社党校训练班的学习，认真地学习了党的基本知识、毛主席著作和党的有关方针政策，大家的思想领域更加丰富了。一有时间，几个老大娘就凑在一起讨论着她们所学到的东西，从党的发展一直谈到党的最终目的——共产主义。古娘的学习劲头比别人更足，每天晚上，她先把第二天的工作想好，然后就坐在灯下专心致志地翻着《矛盾论》、《实践论》……她一字一句地咀嚼着，实在弄不懂或看不明白的就记下来，转天就去请教别人。为了有计划地提高政治理论水平，古娘还和大家一块制订了学习的制度，每个星期二、四、六的早晨，社委们就集中到一起学习或讨论一小时。水涨船高，古娘和其他的社委们对自己的工作也要求得更加严格了，哪里有困难，就带头到哪里。在倾盆大雨的深夜里，为了不使木料受湿变型，几个社长就升起火，连夜一块一块地烤着木料。她们就是这样用实际行动来教育广大的社员，社员们也越来越尊重和爱戴他们的社长了，只要社长要求作的事情，大家没有不抢着干的。（附图片）
