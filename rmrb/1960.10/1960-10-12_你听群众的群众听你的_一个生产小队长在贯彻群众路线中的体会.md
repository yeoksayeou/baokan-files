    You Listen to the Masses, The Masses Listen to You
    -- A Production Team Leader's Experience in Implementing the Mass Line
    Wang Yiping

    Li Junqing was originally the leader of the Seventh Production Team of Zaer'gou in the Chengchuan Commune, Huicheng County, Gansu Province. He was recently transferred to the Third Production Team as its leader. Although he has left, the members of the Seventh Team always miss him. The team members say that they feel a bit lost if they don't see Li Junqing for a day. Especially the older people, who, when they mention him, say: It's like a good "daughter" from our family has left, we're really not used to it! When Li Junqing was in the Seventh Team, he was a good head of the household. He led everyone to work hard and turned a poor family into a rich one, transforming a production-reducing team into a production-exceeding team.

    Li Junqing really has a knack for managing this household. The Seventh Team has twenty-nine households, more than one hundred members, and Li Junqing treats them as his own fathers, sons, and brothers, considering everything for them. He understands the family background and temperament of each team member, and he can assign farm work according to each person's characteristics. Take the work arrangement before the wheat harvest as an example. The rice paddies needed to be prepared for transplanting, and weeds had to be hoed for corn and potatoes on the hillside. Seedlings also had to be checked and replanted. Several farm tasks were happening at the same time. At that time, some teams sent men and women together, all going to hoe weeds today and all going to prepare rice paddies tomorrow; some teams had women hoeing weeds and men working in the rice paddies; and some teams worked in groups. Li Junqing also divided the labor force of the Seventh Team into several groups, but he did not simply divide them by gender. Based on several years of experience, Li Junqing knew that if people with slightly weaker physical strength hoed seedlings and thinned vegetables, they could hoe one mu a day, which was equivalent to the work of a full laborer; if the strongest people did it, they could only hoe one and a half mu a day. However, strong laborers were needed in the rice paddies. The young and strong had the strength and could stretch out freely. The work of checking and replanting seedlings was not heavy and required more attention to detail, so it was appropriate to assign it to some elderly men. There were also some scattered odd jobs, which could be done by semi-laborers. This division of labor did not delay the farming season, did not waste labor, and met everyone's needs, so no one was dissatisfied. After the work was divided and the quotas were discussed, Li Junqing asked the team members to voluntarily combine and contract for plots of land. This method was most welcomed by the team members. A few people who got along well could chat and laugh together, working quickly and without feeling tired.

    He would arrange five to seven days of farm work at a time, and the team members would go to the fields early in the morning without the captain's urging. However, Li Junqing was not idle either. He would work in this field today and in that field tomorrow. While working, if he found that any team member was not in good spirits or their complexion was not right, he would advise them to rest earlier. On rainy days, if some women were not feeling well or were menstruating, Li Junqing would advise them not to go to the fields, saying: Today it's raining heavily, you'll catch a cold. You can sit on a warm kang in the house and do some sewing, and when the weather clears up, you can go to work, and the clothes and shoes will be complete. These words hit the team members' hearts. For generations, rural women had never received such care and consideration. Now, in this big family, they receive meticulous care in every way. How could they not be moved, how could they not love this big family?

    Li Junqing is only thirty years old this year, and he is good at working, but when it comes to production experience, he is not the most experienced after all. The reason why he can do a good job in production is not only because he resolutely listens to the Party's words, but also because of an important trick: he humbly learns from the masses and listens to their words. No matter what tasks are assigned by the higher authorities, he takes them to discuss with the masses, especially when it comes to farming. The soil quality of the hillside is different on the shady and sunny slopes, the upper and lower halves of the same slope are different, and sometimes the edges and the middle of the same field are also different. The old people have been working these lands for most of their lives, and they all know which land is suitable for which crops, which crops grow well, which crops do not grow well, and which land likes which fertilizer. Li Junqing thought: The team leader must not only understand the temperament of the team members, but also understand the temperament of the land. Whenever he had time, he would squat down and ask the elderly for advice. The elderly would also tell him their experiences like they were telling stories to the younger generation. With these "heirlooms," coupled with new technologies, he had a better grasp of production arrangements. Now, when the team formulates production plans, Li Junqing gathers everyone together to discuss them, and everyone contributes an idea, and a complete plan is quickly produced.

    Li Junqing has learned from his work in the past few years that you must first listen to the masses' words before they are willing to listen to your words. If you believe in the masses, the masses will support you. The Party has put forward this principle a long time ago. Li Junqing has heard it more than once. However, he truly understood the meaning of this sentence at a price. In the past, when the higher authorities assigned tasks, Li Junqing would come back and find a few Party members to make a plan and ask the team members to do it. He did not pay much attention to the opinions raised by the team members who could not understand. At that time, he did not realize that there was anything wrong. But the work was very difficult, and sometimes he put in a lot of effort, but the masses were still not very satisfied. "Why don't the team members listen to me?" Li Junqing couldn't sleep at night, tossing and turning, but couldn't figure out the reason. Once, he went to the county to attend a meeting and listened to a report, which talked about following the mass line and believing in and relying on the masses. This report came at just the right time and really opened his mind. When he came back, he carefully recalled which opinions of the team members he had not listened to, and which things he had decided on his own. There was one thing that he had always felt uneasy about. That was during the spring planting in 1957, when he was about to plant sorghum, and the old man Li Degui suggested that it was not worthwhile to plant sorghum on the Yangwan plot, as it could only be harvested once. Planting corn could yield two harvests. After harvesting the corn, red wheat could be planted. Sorghum stubble land could not be planted with wheat, but only with peas, and that plot was not suitable for growing peas. At that time, Li Junqing did not consider his opinion and only emphasized that the corn area had been completed, but the sorghum had not, so he must plant sorghum. As a result, that plot only yielded an average of more than two hundred and seventy catties of sorghum per mu, and it was barren for a season. Planting corn could have yielded more than two hundred catties of red wheat. After that, the team members rarely offered Li Junqing any opinions. "Yes, the problem may lie here." Once he found the root cause of the problem, it was easy to treat it. Not long after, during the Spring Festival, Li Junqing took the opportunity to solicit opinions from the team members door to door. When he went to Li Degui's house, Li Degui did raise the matter again. Li Junqing immediately made a self-criticism to him, saying that he would definitely listen to everyone's opinions humbly in the future.

    He kept his word. From that day on, he immediately studied the opinions raised by the team members, and he also consulted with everyone on everything, and he followed the opinions of the masses. The team members saw that their words had worked, and they were gradually willing to speak up. During the spring drought resistance campaign last year, the commune Party committee required that the cornfields be universally watered once within five days. Li Junqing took the task back and thought that there was a shortage of labor and was worried that he would not be able to complete the task. He ran to discuss it with the team members, who instead comforted him, saying: "It can be done, we'll start earlier and come back later, and we'll make sure we don't fall behind the other teams." Every day at dawn, the team members would carry water to the fields, and they would not come back until it was completely dark. As a result, they really finished watering in five days. These two things made Li Junqing very moved. He truly understood the importance of the mass line and saw the great power of the masses. After that, the more he believed in and relied on the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses; the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more he cared for and loved the masses. In this way, a production team formed a united and cooperative big family.

    你听群众的群众听你的
    ——一个生产小队长在贯彻群众路线中的体会
    王一平
    李俊清原来是甘肃徽成县成川公社枣儿沟第七小队的队长，不久前才调到第三小队当队长。人离开了，但第七队的社员却总是想念着他。社员们说，一天不见李俊清，就有点想得慌。特别是老年人，提起来就说：像是身边的好“闺女”出了门，真不惯啦！李俊清在七队的时候，是个好当家人。他领着大家埋头苦干，把一个穷家变成了富家，由减产队变成了超产队。
    李俊清当这个家，确实有一套。七队有二十九户，一百多个社员，李俊清把他们当作自己的父子兄弟看待，处处都替他们考虑到了。他了解每个社员的家庭身世、脾气，分配庄稼活，都能根据每个人的特点办事。就拿麦收前那段排工来说吧。稻田里要整地插秧，山坡上玉米、洋芋要锄草，还要查苗补苗，几样农活赶在一起。当时有的队是男女一起上阵，今天全去锄草，明天全去整稻田；有的队是妇女锄草，男的下稻田；也有的队是分小组作业。李俊清把七队劳力也分成几个小组，不过他不是单纯按男女来分的。根据几年的经验，李俊清知道，锄苗、间菜这样的活，体力稍差的人去，一天锄一亩，能顶得上一个全劳力用；让体力最强的人去，一天也锄不了一亩半。而稻田里却需要强劳动力，年轻力壮的有劲，正好伸展得开。查苗补苗的活不重，需要心细一点，分配给几个老汉正合适。还有些零星杂务活，让半劳力去做。这样分工，不误农时，不浪费劳动力，又适合每个人的需要，没有一个不满意的。分好工，讨论好定额，李俊清又让社员自愿结合分包地块，这个办法社员最欢迎。几个合脾气的人在一起谈谈笑笑，干得又快又不觉累。
    一次安排五天到七天的农活，每天不用队长催，社员一早便下地。但是李俊清也并不清闲，他今天在这块地里劳动，明天到那块地里劳动。在劳动中，发现哪个社员精神不好或是脸色不大对，就劝他早点去休息。下雨天，有的妇女身体不好或是月经来了，李俊清就劝她们不要下地，说：今天雨大，会淋坏身子，你在屋里坐上个热炕，把鞋脚针线活做做，天晴再出工，衣裳鞋袜也齐全。这话算是说到社员们的心上了。农家妇女，世世代代没有受到过人们这样的关怀和体贴，如今在这个大家庭里，处处得到细致入微的照顾，怎能不感动，怎能不爱这个大家庭？
    李俊清今年才三十岁，干活是一把好手，可是要论起生产经验来，毕竟不是最在行的。他所以能把生产搞好，除了坚决听党的话之外，还有一个重要的窍门：虚心向群众学习，听群众的话，不管上级布置什么任务下来，他都拿去和群众商量，种地尤其如此。山坡地，阴坡和阳坡土质不一样，同一片坡上半截和下半截不一样，同一块地，边上和中间有时候也不一样。这些土地在老人们手里盘了大半辈子，他们全知道哪块地种什么肯长，种什么不长，哪块地喜欢什么肥料。李俊清想：当队长的不光要摸清社员的脾气，也要摸清土地的脾气。他一有空就蹲下来向老人们请教，老年人也就像对后生们说故事一样，把肚子里的经验都掏出来传给他了。有了这些“传家宝”，再加上新技术，安排生产就有了把握。现在队里订生产计划的时候，李俊清就把大家召集在一起讨论，一人献一条计，一个完整的计划很快就产生出来。
    李俊清从这几年的工作中，得到一个体会：要先听群众的话，群众才肯听你的话，你相信群众，群众就支持你。这个道理党老早就提出来了。李俊清也不止一次听说过。但是，他真正懂得这句话的意义，却是花费了代价的。过去上级布置下任务，李俊清回来就找几个党员订个计划，叫社员去做。社员想不通的事，提了意见他也不大注意。那时，他没有觉察到有什么不好。但工作起来很费劲，有时候费了很大力气，群众还不大满意。“为什么社员不听我的话呢？”李俊清夜里睡不着觉，翻来复去地想，也想不出个道理来。一次，他到县里去开会，听了一次报告，谈到要走群众路线，要相信群众，依靠群众。这次报告正说在节骨眼上，真正开了心窍。他回来就仔细回想，平时社员有哪些意见自己没听的，有哪些事情自己独断独行的。有一件事，他想起来心中一直不安。那是在1957年春播的时候，正要种高粱，李德贵老汉提出意见说洋湾那块地种高粱不合算，只能收一季，种玉米可以收两季。收了玉米能种红麦，高粱茬地不能种麦，只能种莞豆，而那块地是不长莞豆的地。当时李俊清没有考虑他的意见，只强调玉米面积已经完成了，高粱没完成，一定要种高粱。结果那块地平均每亩只收了二百七十多斤高粱，荒了一季，种玉米就可多收回二百多斤红麦。从那以后，社员们再很少向李俊清提什么意见。“对，毛病可能出在这里。”找到病根子，就好治病了。不久过春节，李俊清趁这个机会，便挨门逐户去征求社员的意见。走到李德贵家里，李德贵果然又提起这件事。李俊清立即向他作了检讨，表示今后一定虚心听大家的意见。
    说到做到，从那天起，社员提了意见，他立即研究，做什么事也都找大家商量，照群众的意见去办。社员们看见自己讲的话起了作用，慢慢地有话也愿意说了。去年春天防旱抗旱运动中，公社党委要求在五天内把玉米地普遍浇一次水，李俊清领了任务回来，认为劳力少，耽心完不成任务。他跑去和社员们商量，谁知社员反倒安慰起他来，说：“能行，我们起早一点，晚回一点，保证不落在别队后面。”每天天一明，社员就担水上地，晚上黑尽了才回来。结果五天真浇完了。这两件事使李俊清非常感动，他真正懂得了群众路线的重要，看见了群众的巨大力量。这以后，他越是相信群众，依靠群众，群众干劲就越大；群众劲头大了，他也就越关心群众，爱护群众。就这样，一个生产小队结成了一个同心合力的大家庭。
