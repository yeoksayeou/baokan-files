    Cultivating a Style of Loving Science, Loving Labor, and Not Fearing Difficulties
    Shanghai Middle and Primary School Students Conduct Scientific Research
    (Our report) Shanghai's middle and primary schools, combining teaching with the organization of student scientific and technological activities, have formed a widespread, sustained, and in-depth mass movement. Currently, a total of 700,000 students in the city are participating in scientific and technological activities. Among them, more than 90% are middle school students, and more than 8% are students above the third grade of primary school. They have established nearly 28,000 scientific and technological activity groups. Since the beginning of this year, the exhibitions held by various districts alone have showcased more than 50,000 pieces of juvenile scientific and technological works.
    Currently, many schools have established mathematics groups, 80% of middle schools have weather groups, and participate in scientific and technological activities such as making radios, aviation models, ship models, and chemical products. More than 50,000 people participate in the production of aviation models alone, and nearly 10,000 people participate in the production of ship models, and some of them have achieved excellent results. The "Young Pioneer Rabbit Farm" of Shangta Central Primary School in Qingpu County has provided more than 2,000 breeding rabbits to the commune in the past year, promoting the development of the commune's rabbit breeding sideline. Students from Nanhui Middle School, Jingye Middle School, and the First Affiliated Middle School of East China Normal University have produced analog computers, electronic sensors, and various remote control equipment. Through these activities, the children have gained far richer knowledge than in the classroom in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, meteorology, medicine and other aspects, broadened their horizons, and improved their learning quality and academic performance. The Senior Three (3) mathematics group of Fuxing Middle School, in the mathematical research activity of trial-producing a four-way switch, not only reviewed the mathematical knowledge learned in class very well, but also studied mathematical principles and logic courses. Many students not only learned to make them, but also explored their theoretical reasons and wrote articles.
    The more scientific and technological activities that young people carry out, the more they thirst for learning more scientific knowledge, thereby placing higher demands on classroom teaching and promoting the in-depth development of teaching reform. Among the 1,300 students at the First Affiliated Middle School of East China Normal University, 300 can assemble three-tube to five-tube radios, and 600 can assemble one-tube radios.
    Through carrying out scientific and technological activities, the most practical and vivid communist education has been carried out for the majority of middle and primary school students, enabling them to establish a communist style of daring to think, speak, and act from an early age, and cultivating a spirit of loving labor, abiding by discipline, being down-to-earth, hardworking, and not fearing difficulties.

    培养青少年爱科学爱劳动不畏困难的风格
    上海中小学生开展科学研究
    本报讯　上海市中、小学校结合教学，组织学生开展科学技术活动，已形成广泛、持久、深入的群众运动。目前，全市参加科学技术活动的学生，共有七十万人。其中中学生达90％以上，小学三年级以上的学生，也超过8％。他们共建立了将近二万八千个科学技术活动小组。今年以来，仅是各区举办的展览会，就展出了少年科学技术作品五万多件。
    现在，许多学校都成立了数学小组，80％的中学设有气象小组，参加制作收音机、航空模型、船舰模型、化工产品等科学技术活动。仅是参加航空模型制作活动的有五万多人，参加制作船舰模型的有近万人，而且其中一部分人还做出了优异的成绩。青浦县商榻中心小学的“红领巾养兔场”，一年来为公社提供了二千多只种兔，促进了公社养兔副业的发展。南汇中学、敬业中学、华东师范大学第一附属中学等校的学生，制出了模拟计算机、电子感应器和多种遥控设备。孩子们通过这些活动，获得了比课堂上丰富得多的数学、物理、化学、生物、天文气象和医学等多方面的知识，扩大了眼界，提高了学习质量和学习成绩。复兴中学高三（3）数学小组，在试制四联开关的数学研究活动中，不仅很好地复习了课堂上学得的数学知识，还钻研了数学的数理和逻辑等课程。许多学生不仅学会制作，而且探索其理论原因，写出了文章。
    青少年们进行科学技术活动越多，越是渴求学习更多的科学知识，从而对课堂教学提出了更高的要求，促进了教学改革的深入开展。在华东师范大学第一附属中学的一千三百个学生中，已有三百人会装三灯到五灯的收音机，六百人会装一灯机。
    通过开展科学技术活动，对广大中、小学生进行了最实际、最生动的共产主义教育，使他们从小就树立起敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，培养起爱劳动、守纪律和踏实苦干、不畏困难的精神。
