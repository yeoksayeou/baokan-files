"Samba" is a Brazilian song and dance that originated in Africa. It is accompanied by Brazilian folk instruments, with dance and song interwoven throughout the performance. The lyrics of the ancient "Samba" are often in the form of allegories. Later, Samba became a dance music. Tonight, the Samba Troupe performed brilliant programs such as "Hello, Coffee" and "Rio de Janeiro Carnival" using Brazilian national musical instruments. These programs were full of the life of the Brazilian people and rich in the melody and rhythm of Brazilian national music, which was warmly welcomed by the audience.

The Samba Troupe will have a one-month performance tour in China. After their performances in Beijing, they will also visit and perform in Shanghai, Jinan, Guangzhou and other places.

He said: "In the past few years, our country has received many Brazilian friends, and their visits have left a deep impression on the Chinese people. Our cultural delegations and art troupes have also paid friendly visits to Brazil and have been warmly welcomed by the Brazilian people."
