    Hubei Carefully Harvests Autumn Grain
    Hubei is actively carrying out a meticulous autumn grain harvesting campaign. Currently, two million laborers are concentrated on the harvest front. As of the 6th, over 12 million mu of various autumn-harvested crops have been collected.
    To ensure the success of the autumn harvest, various regions have comprehensively assessed the distribution and maturity periods of autumn crops, rationally arranged harvesting times and labor. Based on the characteristics of different crops, specific methods for careful harvesting have been proposed for each process, including cutting, bundling, transporting, stacking, threshing, and storing.
    Inner Mongolia Basically Completes Autumn Harvest
    The high-speed, high-standard autumn harvest blitz in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved remarkable results. By October 5th, except for some areas finishing up, most areas had basically completed harvesting. The area of crops harvested accounts for 87.2% of the area to be harvested in the region. Currently, the main effort is shifting to rushing transportation, threshing, and warehousing, while seizing the opportunity to carry out autumn plowing and autumn irrigation.
    Collect Wild Plants and Vigorously Promote Comprehensive Utilization
    Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Henan are carrying out small autumn harvest movements. In Liaoning Province, according to statistics at the end of September, more than 3 million people participated in the campaign, collecting more than 230,000 tons of various wild plants. As of the 5th of this month in Ningxia, the region has collected more than 15 million jin of grass seeds and tree seeds, and more than 12 million jin of starch raw materials.
    While picking wild plants, various regions have carried out large-scale processing and comprehensive utilization. Inner Mongolia has used various domestic and wild seeds, shells, leaves, and stems to produce nearly a hundred kinds of finished and semi-finished products. Henan uses wild plants as raw materials for light industry, adding many commodities to the market.
    Shanghai Suburbs Have Accumulated Half of the Base Fertilizer for Autumn Planting
    The counties in the suburbs of Shanghai launched a heated fertilizer accumulation campaign before the busy "Three Autumns" season. So far, the counties have accumulated half of the fertilizer needed for autumn planting.
    The area for autumn planting in the suburbs of Shanghai will be larger than last year, and the quality requirements for sowing are also high, so the demand for base fertilizer is much greater than in previous years. Now, more than 500,000 people in the suburbs are active on the fertilizer accumulation front every day, driving more than 30,000 boats and tens of thousands of vehicles. Due to the concentration of labor and the leadership going deep into the front line, the fertilizer accumulation movement in Nanhui, Pudong, and other counties is strong and progressing rapidly, and they have now completed more than 70% of their fertilizer accumulation plans.

    湖北细收细打秋粮
    湖北各地积极开展秋粮细收细打运动。目前，集中到抢收战线上的有二百万劳动力，到六日止，已收各种秋收作物一千二百多万亩。
    为了做好秋收工作，各地普遍对秋收作物的分布和成熟期进行了摸底排队，合理安排了收割时间和劳力；按照不同作物的特性，各地在割、捆、运、堆、打、藏等工序上都提出了精收细打的具体办法。
    内蒙古基本收完秋田
    内蒙古自治区开展的高速度、高标准的秋收突击旬取得优异成绩。到十月五日，除部分地区进行扫尾外，绝大部分地区基本收割完毕，全区已收获作物占应收面积的百分之八十七点二。目前，各地的主要力量已转向突击拉运、碾打、入库，同时抓紧时机搞秋翻和秋浇。
    采集野生植物大搞综合利用
    辽宁、内蒙古、宁夏、河南正在开展小秋收运动。辽宁全省参加运动的人数据九月底统计，达三百多万人次，已采集各种野生植物二十三万多吨；宁夏截至本月五日，全区已采草籽和树籽一千五百多万斤，淀粉原料一千二百多万斤。
    在采摘野生植物的同时，各地大规模地开展了加工和综合利用业务。内蒙古已经利用各种家生和野生的籽、壳、叶、茎制成了近百种成品和半成品；河南利用野生植物作为轻工业原料，为市场增添了许多商品。
    上海郊区秋播底肥已积好一半
    上海市郊各县抢在“三秋”大忙之前，掀起了热火朝天的积肥运动。到目前为止，各县已积好秋播需肥数量的一半。
    上海郊区秋播面积将比去年扩大，播种质量要求也高，基肥的需要量大大超过往年。现在，全郊区每天有五十多万人，驾驶着三万多条船和数万辆车，活跃在积肥战线上。南汇、浦东等县由于劳动力集中，领导深入第一线，积肥运动声势大，进度快，目前都已完成积肥计划百分之七十以上。
