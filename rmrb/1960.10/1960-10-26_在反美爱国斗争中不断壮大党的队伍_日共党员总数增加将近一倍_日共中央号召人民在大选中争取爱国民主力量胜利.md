Xinhua News Agency, October 24th, Tokyo Dispatch: A statement published today in the "Akahata" by the Central Committee Secretariat of the Japanese Communist Party said that by October 22nd, the number of JCP members in 32 prefectures had doubled, and for the party as a whole, the number of members had increased by 90%. The statement congratulated all party members and party organizations on the brilliant achievements made in the movement to double membership.

The statement also said that not only had the number of Communist Party members increased, but the circulation of the Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" and the "Akahata" Sunday edition had also increased. In fourteen months, the circulation of "Akahata" increased by 50%, and the circulation of the "Akahata" Sunday edition increased threefold.

The statement said that the achievements made in the movement to increase party membership prove that the decisions of the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party were correct, pointing out that American imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital are the main enemies of the Japanese people.

Xinhua News Agency, October 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: Shiga Yoshio, member of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Japanese Communist Party and member of the House of Representatives, yesterday fiercely criticized in the Diet the ugly collusion between the Ikeda government and the police authorities with Japanese fascist groups and American secret agents. This left Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda and other government officials embarrassed.

At a joint meeting of the House of Representatives' Legal Affairs Committee and Local Administration Committee held before the dissolution of the Diet, Shiga revealed secret materials on intelligence activities conducted by the Shimane Prefecture Police Headquarters' Security Division from 1951 to 1958.

Citing police materials, Shiga revealed that the police in Shimane Prefecture had provided financial assistance to fascist terrorists six times. He also revealed that the police gave money to U.S. Central Intelligence Agency agents in the name of "Christmas gifts."

Government officials were speechless and did not know how to respond to Shiga's questioning. Yoshio Miwa, chief of the Security Division of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, expressed surprise at the large amount of material obtained by the Japanese Communist Party. When he asked Shiga to return the material, it aroused laughter from the members of the Diet. Apart from replying that he would investigate the matter, he could not answer any of Shiga's questions.

Shiga also revealed that the Liberal Democratic Party had given 200,000 yen to a fascist thug organization called the "New Youth Association."

Shiga then quoted an article written by a senior official of the Metropolitan Police Department published in a recent issue of a police publication. This article revealed that fascists were plotting to assassinate left-wing leaders one by one. According to this article, Shiga said that although the police knew in advance of the fascists' plan to assassinate Socialist Party Chairman Asanuma, they deliberately failed to take preventive measures to stop it.

Following Shiga's exposure, the head of the National Police Agency was forced to admit that he had received such intelligence before Asanuma's assassination. The police chief was questioned in a very embarrassing manner.

On October 23rd, Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, exposed in the House of Councillors the ugly deeds of the Liberal Democratic Party's Hayato Ikeda in providing funds to many Japanese fascist groups.

Xinhua News Agency, October 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party today issued an appeal calling on all party members and the people to strive for the victory of patriotic and democratic forces, especially the Japanese Communist Party, in the upcoming general election. The appeal stated that under the firm demands of the Japanese people, the Ikeda government was forced to announce the dissolution of the Diet. The appeal condemned the Ikeda government for attempting to forcibly implement the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," slandering the people's demands for neutrality as "fantasy," and expressing loyalty to the United States.

The appeal also condemned the Ikeda government for condoning right-wing thugs in assassinating Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma, and for not only failing to take responsibility for this terrorist act, but also attempting to take the opportunity to strengthen the suppression of patriotic and democratic forces, provoke the people, and plot to undermine the patriotic and democratic united front.

The appeal emphasized that we must thoroughly crush this conspiracy.

The appeal stated that the Japanese Communist Party has consistently and bravely fought against fascism and militarism for forty years, and has consistently fought for Japan's independence, peace, and democracy since the post-war period.

The appeal emphasized that internationally, socialist forces have overwhelmed imperialist forces. In the past year, the number of members of the Japanese Communist Party has doubled, and the people's trust and support for it has become stronger and stronger.

The appeal concluded by calling on all party members, workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life to immediately devote all their strength to fighting for the abolition of the new "Security Treaty," for Japan's peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality, and for the rapid development of the Japanese Communist Party.

    在反美爱国斗争中不断壮大党的队伍
    日共党员总数增加将近一倍
    日共中央号召人民在大选中争取爱国民主力量胜利
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会今天在“赤旗报”上发表的一篇声明说，到10月22日为止，已有三十二个县的日共党员人数都增加了一倍，就全党来说，党员人数共已增加了90％。这篇声明祝贺全体党员和党组织在使党员增加一倍的运动中所取得的光辉成就。
    声明还说，不仅共产党员有了增加，共产党的机关报“赤旗报”和“赤旗报”星期日版的发行量也有所增加。在十四个月中，“赤旗报”的发行量增加了50％，“赤旗报”星期日版的发行量增加了两倍。
    声明说，增加党员的运动所取得的成就证明，共产党第七次全国代表大会的决定是正确的，这个决定指出美帝国主义和日本垄断资本是日本人民的主要敌人。
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央干部会委员、众议员志贺义雄昨天在国会中猛烈抨击池田政府和警察当局勾结日本法西斯团体和美国特务的丑行。这使得日本首相池田勇人和其他政府官员狼狈不堪。
    志贺在众议院法务委员会和地方行政委员会在国会解散前举行的联席会议上揭发了岛根县警察本部警备科从1951年至1958年的八年中进行情报活动的秘密材料。
    志贺引用警察的材料揭发说，岛根县的警察曾经六次拿钱接济法西斯恐怖分子。他还揭露，警察以“圣诞礼物”为名送钱给美国中央情报局的特务。
    政府官员对志贺的责询瞠目结舌不知所对。东京都警视厅警备科科长三轮良雄对日本共产党获得这样大量的材料表示惊异。当他要求志贺归还材料的时候，引起了议员们的哄笑声。他除了回答说他将调查这件事以外，对志贺的问题不能作任何答复。
    志贺还揭露自由民主党曾经给一个名叫“新青年协会”的法西斯暴徒组织二十万日元。
    志贺接着引用了在最近一期的警察刊物上发表的警视厅高级官员所写的一篇文章。这篇文章透露，法西斯分子阴谋把左翼领袖一个个地暗杀掉。志贺根据这篇文章说，尽管警察事先知道法西斯分子杀害社会党委员长浅沼的计划，他们却有意不采取防范措施加以制止。
    经志贺的揭露，警察厅负责人被迫承认，他在浅沼被刺前已经接获这种情报。这个警察首脑被质问得十分狼狈。
    日本共产党主席野坂参三23日曾在参议院揭露自由民主党池田勇人为日本许多法西斯团体提供资金的丑行。
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会今天发表呼吁书，号召全体党员和人民为在即将举行的大选中争取爱国民主力量，尤其是日本共产党，取得胜利而奋斗。呼吁书说，在日本人民的坚决要求下，池田政府被迫宣布解散国会。呼吁书谴责池田政府企图强行实施新日美“安全条约”，诬蔑人民关于中立的要求是“幻想”，并且对美国表示忠诚。
    呼吁书还谴责池田政府纵容右翼暴徒杀害社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎，并且不仅不对这种恐怖行为承担责任，反而企图趁机加强对爱国民主力量的镇压，向人民进行挑衅，并阴谋破坏爱国民主统一战线。
    呼吁书强调说，我们必须彻底粉碎这种阴谋。
    呼吁书说，日本共产党四十年来一贯为反对法西斯主义和军国主义英勇地进行了斗争，并在战后以来一贯为争取日本的独立、和平、民主而进行了斗争。
    呼吁书强调指出，在国际上，社会主义力量压倒了帝国主义势力，一年来，日本共产党党员人数增加了一倍，人民对它的信任和支持也越来越加强。
    呼吁书最后号召全体党员、工人、农民和各阶层人民立即拿出全部力量，为争取废除新“安全条约”，争取日本的和平、独立、民主、中立，争取日共的飞跃发展而奋斗。
