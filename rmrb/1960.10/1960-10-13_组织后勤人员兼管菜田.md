    Organize Logistics Personnel to Concurrently Manage Vegetable Fields
    The Dengta Commune in Zhongwei County, Ningxia, has cultivated over 3,700 mu of vegetables by reclaiming wasteland and utilizing "edge-of-field" land. How to manage these vegetable fields effectively? The Dongyue Management District has organized logistics personnel such as canteen managers, cooks, and livestock feeders to concurrently manage the vegetable fields in conjunction with their primary duties. Experience has proven that this method yields excellent results. Currently, weeding, fertilization, and insecticide spraying have been widely implemented in the 300 mu of vegetable fields in this management district, and all the vegetables are growing lush and green.
    Organizing logistics personnel to manage vegetable fields is highly beneficial for concentrating labor into the grain production front. Therefore, I believe this experience can be widely promoted. Lu Deheng

    组织后勤人员兼管菜田
    宁夏中卫县灯塔公社利用开垦荒地和“十边”地种了三千七百多亩蔬菜，怎样管好这些菜田呢？东月管理区组织了食堂的管理员、炊事员和饲养员等后勤人员，结合本职工作，兼管菜田。经验证明这种办法效果很好。现在这个管理区的三百亩菜田已经普遍薅了草，追了肥，还喷撒了除虫药粉，全区蔬菜长得嫩绿茂盛。
    把后勤人员组织起来管理菜田，这对集中劳力投入粮食战线大有好处。因此我认为这项经验可以普遍推广。　　　路德恒
