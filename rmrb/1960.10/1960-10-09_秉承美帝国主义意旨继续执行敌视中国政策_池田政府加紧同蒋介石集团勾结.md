Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch: The Japanese Ikeda government, adhering to the will of U.S. imperialism, continues to implement its hostile policy towards China and intensifies its collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

    According to the "Asahi Shimbun," Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda held a "friendly meeting" on the 5th with Ho Ying-chin of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, who is currently active in Japan, to discuss promoting "cultural and economic exchanges" between Japan and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group. Ho Ying-chin arrived in Japan on his way back to Taiwan from the United States.

    Prior to this, the Ikeda government dispatched a delegation led by Speaker of the House of Councillors Tsuruhei Matsuno to Taiwan in late August to discuss strengthening "cooperation" and "promoting relations" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Matsuno told Chiang Kai-shek, "The Ikeda cabinet's China policy is the same as that of the previous cabinet and has not changed." He said, "The Ikeda government will not recognize Communist China." He also assured that the "relationship between Japan and the Chiang Kai-shek clique will absolutely not be separated."

    During this meeting, Matsuno also reached a "completely unified" opinion with Chiang Kai-shek: that Japan should "more closely cooperate" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the South Korean puppet group in Asia in the area of anti-communism in the future.

    池田政府加紧同蒋介石集团勾结
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本池田政府秉承美帝国主义的意旨，继续执行敌视中国的政策，加紧和蒋介石集团的勾结。
    据“朝日新闻”报道，日本首相池田勇人5日曾经同正在日本进行活动的蒋介石集团的何应钦举行了“友好会谈”，讨论了促进日本同蒋介石卖国集团的“文化和经济交流”问题。何应钦是从美国回台湾的途中到达日本的。
    在这以前，池田政府曾经在8月下旬派遣由参议院议长松野鹤平率领的代表团到台湾，同蒋介石集团会谈了加强“合作”和“促进关系”问题。松野向蒋介石表示：“池田新内阁的对华政策和前任内阁的政策一样没有改变”。他说：“池田政府不会承认共产党中国”。他并且保证日本和蒋介石集团之间的“关系绝对不会分离”。
    在这次会谈中，松野还同蒋介石取得“完全一致的”意见：日本今后要同蒋介石集团和南朝鲜傀儡集团在亚洲的反共方面“更加紧密地合作”。
