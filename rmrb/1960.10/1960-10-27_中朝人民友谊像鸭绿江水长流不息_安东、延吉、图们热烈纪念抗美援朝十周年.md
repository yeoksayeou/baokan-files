Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 26th: The heroic people of Andong City, who made tremendous contributions in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, have been carrying out various activities in recent days to warmly commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's departure abroad to fight in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

On the evening of "October 25th," more than 1,500 people from all walks of life in Andong City, along with former Volunteer Army combat heroes, model train drivers from the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, old stretcher bearers, support-the-frontline models, and families of Volunteer Army martyrs, held a grand commemorative meeting. Duan Yongjie, Chairman of the Andong City Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said at the meeting that ten years ago, the people of Andong City, located on the frontline of the motherland and across the river from Korea, stood in a heroic posture on the forefront of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Two years ago, we welcomed the triumphant return of the Volunteer Army on the banks of the Yalu River. However, American imperialism has not learned its lesson from the failure of the war of aggression against Korea and is still赖 (lai) [staying] in South Korea. The Chinese people firmly support the Korean people's struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

In recent days, model figures from Andong City in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea have been enthusiastically holding discussions with former Volunteer Army combat heroes. At one discussion, Su Facheng, a model repairman in Andong City's anti-bombing struggle, Wang Jisheng, a militia hero who captured an American aerial bandit alive under Wulong Mountain, and Wang Yushun, a heroic train driver who participated in the railway aid-Korea contingent, exposed the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism with their personal experiences of struggle. Many factories, schools, and government offices invited former Volunteer Army combat heroes and meritorious workers to give reports. After listening to the reports of former Volunteer Army meritorious workers Sun Degong and Li Gaiwen, more than 3,000 employees of the Andong Silk Factory No. 1 and Silk Factory No. 2 spoke one after another, expressing their determination to learn from the Volunteer Army's heroic and tenacious fighting spirit, strive to improve production technology, break through production bottlenecks, and overfulfill production tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, Yanji, 26th: More than 1,200 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Yanji City, Jilin Province, held a grand gathering on the evening of the 25th to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the great Chinese People's Volunteer Army's departure abroad to fight in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

Among those attending the meeting were Yao Xin, Second Secretary of the Yanbian Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; Tian Renyong, Deputy Secretary; Li Haoyuan and Qiao Shugui, Vice Governors of the Autonomous Prefecture; Peng Shaoxian and Zhou Nanxing, responsible comrades of the Yanbian garrison; Li Qingchun, a former combat hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army; Jiang Laibin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Yanji Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; Jin Yuxun, Vice Chairman of the Prefectural Political Consultative Conference; and Li Deyou, the person in charge of the Yanji City Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee.

Tian Renyong, Deputy Secretary of the Yanbian Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice Chairman of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting. He said that the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people in defeating the U.S. imperialist aggressors defended the independence of Korea, protected our country's security, and safeguarded peace in the Far East and the world.

When talking about the traditional deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, Tian Renyong pointed out: The Chinese and Korean people must always support each other, help each other, and advance hand in hand. The Chinese people will always cherish the combat friendship forged with blood by the people of the two countries as they cherish their own eyes.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 26th: A grand gathering of one thousand representatives from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Tumen Town, Jilin Province, was held on October 25th to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's departure abroad to fight in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Attending the commemorative meeting were the party and government leaders of Tumen Town in Yanji County, military leaders stationed there, former combat heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and heads of various organs, enterprises, and organizations. Personnel from the Railway Transfer Office of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stationed in Tumen Town also attended the commemorative meeting.

Pu Shansong, Chairman of the Tumen Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, delivered a report at the meeting. In his report, he said: The Chinese and Korean people are as close as lips and teeth. In the just struggle against aggression, to defend socialist construction, and to safeguard world peace, the Chinese and Korean people have forged an unbreakable fighting friendship with blood. This friendship will forever be as evergreen as the pine trees of Changbai Mountain and flow unceasingly like the waters of the Yalu River.
