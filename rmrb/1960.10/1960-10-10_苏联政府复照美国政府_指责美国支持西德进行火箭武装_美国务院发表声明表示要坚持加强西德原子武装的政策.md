Xinhua News Agency, October 9th dispatch from Moscow, October 7th: On October 6th, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister G. Pushkin received U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Thompson and handed him the Soviet government's reply to the U.S. government's note of August 8th regarding the issue of West Germany's rocket weapon armament.

In its reply, the Soviet government stated that the so-called "General Memorandum" published in the German Federal Republic government's press office gazette on August 20th clearly demonstrates that the West German military-political aggressive clique is now openly betting on rocket-nuclear warfare. The memorandum demands that the Federal Defense Forces be equipped without restriction with rocket-nuclear weapons and the latest jet aircraft, that a naval fleet be established without any limitations, and that troops and bases of the Federal Defense Forces be stationed outside the territory of the German Federal Republic, in the territories of NATO countries (and not just NATO countries).

The reply stated that it can be seen from the U.S. Embassy's note of August 8th that the U.S. government not only does not condemn the dangerous militarist and revanchist policies pursued by the ruling clique of the German Federal Republic, but also colludes with them, calling this policy a "constructive" policy. The position expounded by the U.S. government in its note undoubtedly shows that the collusion between the U.S. and the West German militarist forces is for the purpose of launching frantic arms race activities and undermining plans for complete and thorough disarmament. It is worth noting that the Supreme Commander of NATO Armed Forces in Europe, U.S. General Norstad, the day after the publication of the Federal Defense Forces Command's memorandum, wrote to the member states of the Western European Union, suggesting further lifting restrictions on West German armaments and granting West Germany the right to build warships with a displacement of 6,000 tons capable of launching nuclear warhead rockets. This demand can only be regarded as condoning West German militarists to realize their militarist ambitions. The reply said: It must be pointed out that the militarist policies pursued by the West German authorities (due to which a new potential hotbed of war has emerged in West Germany) can only be implemented due to the indulgence and support of the U.S. government and other Western countries.

The reply emphasized that the U.S. government has trampled upon and violated international laws at the end of World War II, and it must bear full responsibility for the consequences of its actions before the people of all countries who have suffered from the aggression of German militarism. The Soviet government believes it is its responsibility to once again warn the U.S. government of the danger of the course it is taking, and declares that the Soviet government cannot remain indifferent to the fact of West Germany's armament with rocket-nuclear weapons, and it will have to take the countermeasures it deems necessary to ensure the security of the Soviet Union and its allies, and to ensure peace in Europe and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 7th, categorically denying the dangerous consequences that the Soviet Foreign Ministry pointed out in its note to the U.S. government on the 6th, regarding the U.S. encouraging West German militarism and supporting West Germany's rocket-nuclear weapon armament policy, and stated that the U.S. will adhere to the policy of maintaining military blocs and enabling West Germany to carry out atomic armament.

The U.S. State Department's statement described the ironclad facts pointed out in the Soviet note that the U.S. condoned and helped West Germany's atomic armament to prepare for a war of aggression as "unfounded accusations against NATO's defense measures."

The statement insisted on the U.S. policy of maintaining military blocs and atomic armament of West Germany, claiming that it is now clearer than ever the need for the free world to maintain collective security (i.e., aggressive blocs), including the full participation of the German Federal Republic in NATO.

### 苏联政府复照美国政府  指责美国支持西德进行火箭武装  美国务院发表声明表示要坚持加强西德原子武装的政策

    苏联政府复照美国政府
    指责美国支持西德进行火箭武装
    美国务院发表声明表示要坚持加强西德原子武装的政策
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科7日讯：10月6日，苏联外交部副部长格·普希金接见了美国驻莫斯科大使汤普森，并把苏联政府就西德进行火箭武器武装问题答复美国政府8月8日照会的复照交给了他。
    苏联政府在复照中说，德意志联邦共和国政府新闻局的公报在今年8月20日刊登的所谓“将军备忘录”明显地证明了，西德军事政治侵略集团现在已经公开把赌注押在火箭—核战争上。它在备忘录中要求无限制地用火箭—核武器和最新的喷气式飞机装备联邦国防军，建立不受任何限制的海军舰队，在德意志联邦共和国境外、在北大西洋公约组织国家（而且不只是北大西洋公约组织国家）的领土上驻扎联邦国防军的军队和设置联邦国防军的基地。
    复照说，从美国大使馆今年8月8日的照会中可以看出，美国政府不但不谴责德意志联邦共和国统治集团执行的危险的军国主义和复仇主义政策，而且与他们串通一气，把这个政策称为“建设性的”政策。美国政府在它的照会中所阐述的立场无疑地说明，美国同德意志联邦共和国军国主义势力的勾结，是为了展开疯狂的备战活动和破坏全面彻底裁军的计划。值得注意的是，北大西洋公约组织驻欧洲武装部队总司令、美国将军诺斯塔德在联邦国防军司令部的备忘录发表后的第二天，就写信给西欧联盟各成员国，建议进一步取消对西德军备的限制，赋予西德权利去建造排水量六千吨、能够装置发射核弹头火箭的设备的军舰。这一要求只能被认为是纵容西德军人去实现他们的军国主义野心。复照说：不能不指出，西德当局所执行的军国主义政策（由于这种政策，在西德产生新的潜在的战争温床）所以能够实行，只是由于美国政府和其他西方国家的纵容和支持。
    复照强调说，美国政府蹂躏和违背了第二次世界大战结束时的国际法令，它要在饱受德国军国主义侵略灾难的各国人民面前，对它的行动的后果负全部责任。苏联政府认为有责任再一次警告美国政府注意它所采取的方针的危险性，并声明，苏联政府将不能对用火箭—核武器武装西德的事实漠然视之，它将不得不采取它认为为了保障苏联及其盟国的安全、为了保障欧洲和全世界的和平所必需的对策。
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院在7日发表声明，矢口抵赖苏联外交部在6日给美国政府的照会中指出的美国鼓励西德军国主义和支持西德进行火箭—核武器武装的政策可能导致的危险后果，并且表示美国将坚持奉行维持军事集团和使西德进行原子武装的政策。
    美国国务院的声明把苏联照会中指出的美国纵容和帮助西德原子武装以准备侵略战争的铁证如山的事实，说成是“对北大西洋公约组织的防御措施进行毫无根据的指责”。
    声明坚持美国保持军事集团和原子武装西德的政策，扬言现在比以往任何时候更明显地说明自由世界维护集体安全（即侵略集团）的需要，其中包括德意志联邦共和国全面参加北大西洋公约组织。
