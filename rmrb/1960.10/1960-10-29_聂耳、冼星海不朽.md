Nie Er and Xian Xinghai Are Immortal
    Xia Yan
    Today, cultural and musical workers in the capital will solemnly gather to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the death of Comrade Nie Er, the people's singer and pioneer of Chinese proletarian musical art, and the 15th anniversary of the death of Comrade Xian Xinghai. They have been gone for twenty-five and fifteen years, but they are still alive, they will live forever in the hearts of the Chinese people, and their spirit and their works, it can be said with certainty, are immortal.
    The era in which Nie Er and Xian Xinghai lived was the most critical period of the Chinese national crisis, and also the most intense period of struggle between revolutionary proletarian literary and artistic thought and reactionary bourgeois and fascist literary and artistic thought. They were both intellectuals who came from the old camp, and they still carried considerable inherited burdens. Therefore, when they rushed into the storm of this struggle like petrels, the first thing to decide was which path to take and who to rely on. They decided to take the revolutionary path, the path against imperialism and feudalism, and they chose to rely on the vanguard of the proletariat—the direction of the Chinese Communist Party. Nie Er wrote in his early diaries that to make revolution, one must have a "stable and correct foothold." Thus, he joined the Chinese Communist Party in Shanghai in 1933, during the most severe period of white terror. When Xian Xinghai returned from Europe, he encountered the high tide of the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. He had lived in the slums of Paris, and life had long made him aware of the differences between the two different musical arts representing the two classes. Therefore, as soon as he returned to Shanghai, he plunged into the proletarian music ranks like a fish in water. They found the right direction, found their "foothold," and used music as a weapon to serve the revolutionary struggle at the time. Under the leadership of the Party, they connected with the masses, drew creative nourishment from the struggle, and transformed themselves through practical struggle, gradually becoming proletarian revolutionary fighters.
    They had different backgrounds and different experiences, and their creative styles were also different, but they were both fearless and brave people, and they were both revolutionary optimists who knew no difficulties or fatigue. When they stood at the forefront of the music front, holding high the banner of revolutionary music, they were both very young, they had no "fame," no "diplomas," and even—especially Nie Er—had not received "basic training" in formal musical art. However, their appearance was like a thunderclap in the clear sky, like a lion intimidating the mountains. They dared to despise the seemingly powerful "authorities," dared to wage a resolute struggle against these "authorities," and completely ignored all the ridicule and sarcasm from the bourgeois "academic schools." They participated in practical struggle, learned in struggle, and honed their weapons in struggle. They used the experience and techniques accumulated from practical struggle to create a large number of excellent works that truly reflected the thoughts and feelings of the revolutionary masses. Nie Er wrote "Pioneers" and "March of the Volunteers," shaping the musical image of the working class for the first time in the modern history of Chinese music; Xian Xinghai used heroic melodies to sing the song "Where the enemy attacks, we will destroy them there," and then created the immortal work "Yellow River Cantata," which expresses the great spirit and revolutionary spirit of the Chinese nation. The time of their creative activities was very short. They were like petrels in a storm, coming suddenly and leaving quickly, but within this short period of three to five years, they left the Chinese people with a large number of passionate and eternally inspiring works.
    China's new musical art grew up in the revolutionary and fighting years, from the revolutionary struggle of the masses. Therefore, the works of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai have the characteristics of clear purpose and distinct tendency. At the same time, China's new musical art became a weapon for uniting and educating the people in the revolutionary struggle from the very beginning. It first had to circulate among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and it inevitably had to pass the test and approval of the people. Therefore, the works of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai have the characteristics of being native, nationalized, and mass-oriented. The path taken by Nie Er and Xian Xinghai is the path for Chinese intellectuals to constantly transform themselves and become proletarian fighters under the leadership of the Party and in the revolutionary struggle of the masses. The revolutionary and fighting spirit and the mass and nationalized direction reflected in the works of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai are the most cherished traditions of our country's musical art.
    Comrade Nie Er has been dead for twenty-five years, and Comrade Xian Xinghai has been dead for fifteen years. They have left us, and they did not see the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. However, their songs and their spirit will always be remembered in our hearts. "Those who do not want to be slaves" have "risen up," the three great mountains weighing on our heads have been overthrown, and our motherland is about to become a strong socialist country standing tall in the world. The ideals of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai have been realized. Today, we use the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune to comfort our early deceased comrades-in-arms. Next year, on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Party, we must use musical works worthy of this great era to offer them fragrant flowers and fine wine. (Attached picture)

    聂耳、冼星海不朽
    夏衍
    今天，首都的文化、音乐工作者将隆重地举行集会，纪念中国人民的歌手、中国无产阶级音乐艺术的先驱者聂耳同志的逝世二十五周年，和冼星海同志的逝世十五周年纪念日。他们两个离开我们已经二十五年、十五年了，但是他们还活着，他们将永生在中国人民的心里，他们的精神，他们的作品，可以肯定地说，已经是永生不朽的了。
    聂耳和冼星海所处的时代，正是中国民族危机最严重的时代，也正是革命的无产阶级文艺思想和反动的资产阶级文艺思想、法西斯文艺思想斗争得最剧烈的时代。他们都是从旧垒中来的知识分子，他们身上也还有不小的因袭的负担，所以，当他们像海燕一般冲入这一场斗争的暴风雨中来的时候，首先要决定的是走哪一条道路和依靠什么人的问题，他们决定了走革命的道路，走反帝国主义反封建的道路，他们选择了依靠无产阶级的先锋队——中国共产党的方向。聂耳在他早年的日记中写过，要革命，就得要求自己有一个“稳定的、正确的立足点”，这样，他就在白色恐怖最严重的1933年在上海参加了中国共产党。冼星海从欧洲回来的时候，正碰上了抗日救亡运动的高潮，他住过巴黎的贫民窟，生活早就使他认识了代表两个阶级的两种不同的音乐艺术的差别，所以一回到上海，他就如鱼得水一般地投身到无产阶级的音乐队伍中来了。他们找对了方向，找到了“立足点”，他们用音乐作为武器来为当时的革命斗争服务，他们在党的领导下联系群众，从斗争中汲取创作的营养，并从实际斗争中来改造自己，逐步地使自己成为一个无产阶级的革命战士。
    他们两个有不同的出身，不同的经历，在创作上也有不同的风格，但是，他们都是无畏的人、勇敢的人，他们都是不知困难、不知疲劳的革命乐观主义者。当他们站在音乐战线的前列，高举起革命音乐的大旗的时候，他们都很年轻，他们没有“名气”，没有“文凭”，甚至也没有——特别是聂耳——受过正规的音乐艺术的“基本训练”，可是，他们的出现像是一声晴空的巨雷，像是一头威慑群山的狮子。他们敢于藐视貌似强大的“权威”，敢于和这些“权威”作坚决的斗争，他们根本就无视一切资产阶级“学院派”对他们的奚落和讥诮。他们参加实际斗争，在斗争中学习，在斗争中切切实实地磨砺自己的武器，也就用这种从实际斗争中积累起来的经验和技术，创作了大量优秀的、真正能够反映革命群众的思想感情的作品。聂耳写下了《开路先锋》、《义勇军进行曲》等等，在中国近代音乐史上第一次塑造了工人阶级的音乐形象；冼星海用豪迈的调子，唱出了“敌人从那里进攻，我们就要他在那里灭亡”的歌声，接着就创造了表现中华民族的伟大气魄和革命精神的《黄河大合唱》这一部不朽的作品。他们两个的创作活动的时间都很短促，他们真有点像暴风雨中的海燕，骤然而来，倏然而去，可是他们却就在这短促的三五年的时间之内，给中国人民留下了大量热情如火、永远振奋人心的作品。
    中国的新音乐艺术是在革命和斗争的年代里，从群众的革命斗争中成长起来的，所以聂耳和冼星海的作品就具备了目的性很明确、倾向性很鲜明的特点；同时，中国新音乐艺术一开始就成为革命斗争中的一种团结人民、教育人民的武器，它首先要在工农兵群众中流传，它必然地先要通过人民群众的考验和批准，所以聂耳和冼星海的作品就具有土生土长的、民族化、群众化的特色。聂耳和冼星海所走的道路，是中国知识分子在党的领导下，在群众的革命斗争中不断改造自己而成为一个无产阶级战士的道路。聂耳和冼星海的作品中所反映出来的革命的、战斗的精神，和群众化、民族化的方向，正就是我国音乐艺术的最值得珍视的传统。
    聂耳同志逝世已经二十五年、冼星海同志逝世已经十五年了，他们离开了我们，他们没有能看到中国人民革命的胜利，但是，他们的歌声，他们的精神，却将永远铭记在我们的心里。“不愿做奴隶的人们”已经“起来”，压在我们头上的三座大山已被推倒，我们的祖国即将成为一个社会主义的强国而屹立于世界。聂耳、冼星海的理想已经实现了。今天，我们用总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三面红旗来告慰我们早逝了的战友，明年，在建党四十周年的时候，我们一定要以无愧于今天这个伟大时代的音乐作品，来作为献给他们的香花和旨酒。（附图片）
    学习了聂耳和冼星海的榜样，把战斗的凯歌到处传扬！
