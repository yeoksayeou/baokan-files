Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from New York: Raúl Roa, head of the Cuban delegation to the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly and Cuban Foreign Minister, wrote to Frederick Boland, President of the 15th UNGA session last night, requesting that the issue of American aggression and intervention in Cuba be included on the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly. In his letter, Roa cited facts proving that planes taking off from the United States have continuously airdropped large quantities of weapons and other supplies into Cuban territory to support rebel elements opposed to the Cuban revolutionary government.

Roa pointed out that the purpose of this American action is to establish a vanguard force within Cuban territory for the invasion of Cuba, to extinguish the freedom Cuba has gained, and to make it once again subordinate to American monopoly capital. Roa emphasized that the aforementioned acts of aggression committed by the US government against the Republic of Cuba are a blatant violation of Cuba's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and a clear threat to international peace and security.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from Washington: US Vice President Nixon vigorously advocated on the 18th that the United States should intensify measures to intervene in Cuba.

Speaking at a gathering of the American Veterans Organization in Miami, Florida, he viciously called the Castro revolutionary regime in Cuba an "intolerable malignant tumor in the Western Hemisphere." He advocated that "free nations" of the West should take swift measures to intervene in Cuba under the pretext of so-called "preventing further Soviet infiltration."

Nixon was particularly displeased with the Cuban people's confiscation of American monopoly capital's enterprises in Cuba to safeguard national sovereignty. He clamored that "our aim must be to isolate the Castro regime" and to "take the toughest possible economic measures very quickly" to deal with Cuba.

Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy also clamored at the same gathering that the United States should intensify its policy of aggression against Cuba. He particularly advocated expanding American influence through "economic aid" and such means as so-called "training future leaders for Africa, Asia, and Latin America," and falsely sympathizing with the national independence movements in these places to deceive the people of these countries. He believes that only in this way can the revolution that took place in Cuba be prevented from happening again "on America's doorstep." Previously, on the 15th, Kennedy also put forward a "five-point plan" for aggression and subversion against Cuba, blatantly advocating that the United States should make Cuba "contained, isolated, and stillborn."

The US State Department issued a statement on the 17th, expressing annoyance at the Cuban government's execution of two American spies. The statement attempted to conceal the US conspiracy to subvert the Cuban government, portraying the matter as merely a private action by "individual Americans," and threatening the Cuban government by saying: "The consequences of inflammatory exploitation of these individuals' actions to the detriment of the United States could be very serious."

Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from Tegucigalpa: Honduran Congressman Ildefonso Orellana Bueso condemned on the 17th, according to the Latin American News Agency, that thirty airplanes taking off from the United States, carrying Batista elements and military supplies, arrived at several bases in Guatemala on the 16th in order to invade Cuba from these bases. Orellana pointed out that some people want to use these supplies and the supplies previously transported to Guatemala to launch an act of aggression against the Cuban people from Guatemalan territory. Orellana went on to say that these transport planes have already landed at various bases in Puerto Barrios and Retalhuleu on the Pacific coast.

    罗亚要求联大讨论美国侵略古巴
    尼克松肯尼迪鼓吹美国加紧采取干涉古巴的措施
    洪都拉斯一议员揭露美国准备从危地马拉入侵古巴
    新华社19日讯　纽约消息：古巴参加联合国大会第十五届会议代表团团长、古巴外交部长罗亚昨天晚上写信给十五届联大会议主席博兰，要求把美国对古巴的侵略和干涉问题列入本届大会议程。罗亚在信中列举事实证明，自美国起飞的飞机不断向古巴领土空投大批武器和其他物资支持那些反对古巴革命政府的叛乱分子。
    罗亚指出，美国这种行动的目的是想在古巴领土上建立一支侵入古巴的先头部队，是想扑灭古巴已经获得的自由并使它重新从属于美国大垄断资本。罗亚强调指出，美国政府对古巴共和国所进行的上述侵略行动是对古巴的独立、主权和领土完整的明目张胆的破坏和对国际和平和安全的明显的威胁。
    新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：美国副总统尼克松18日大力鼓吹美国要加紧采取措施来干涉古巴。
    他在佛罗里达州迈阿密美国退伍军人组织的一个集会上发表演说时恶毒地把古巴卡斯特罗革命政权称为“西半球的一个不可容忍的毒瘤”。他主张西方“自由国家”迅速采取措施，在所谓“防止苏联进一步渗透”的借口下对古巴进行干涉。
    尼克松对古巴人民为了维护国家主权而没收美国垄断资本在古巴的企业一事特别不满。他叫嚣说，“我们的目的必须是把卡斯特罗政权隔离开来”，并且“非常迅速地采取尽可能强硬的经济措施”来对付古巴。
    民主党总统候选人肯尼迪在同一个集会上也叫嚷美国要加紧采取侵略古巴的政策。他特别主张通过“经济援助”以及所谓“为非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲训练未来领袖”等手段来扩张美国的势力，并且假装同情这些地方的民族独立运动来欺骗这些国家的人民。他认为，只有这样才能使发生在古巴的革命不致在“美国的台阶上”再度发生。在这以前，肯尼迪在15日还提出了一个侵略和颠覆古巴的“五点计划”，露骨地鼓吹美国要使古巴“受到限制、孤立和就地夭折”。
    美国国务院17日发表了一个声明，对古巴政府处决两名美国间谍感到恼火。声明力图掩饰美国颠覆古巴政府的阴谋，把事情说成仿佛只是“个别美国人”的私人行动，并且威胁古巴政府说：“煽动性利用这些个人的行为而使美国的地位受影响，其后果可能是非常严重的。”
    新华社19日讯　据拉丁美洲通讯社自特古西加尔巴报道，洪都拉斯众议员伊耳德丰索·奥雷利亚纳·布埃索17日谴责说，装运着巴蒂斯塔分子和军事物资的三十架自美国起飞的飞机于16日抵达危地马拉的若干基地，以便从这些基地入侵古巴。奥雷利亚纳指出，有人想用这些物资和早先运到危地马拉的物资从危地马拉的国土上发动一次反对古巴人民的侵略活动。奥雷利亚纳接着说，这些运输机已经在太平洋沿岸的巴利俄港和雷塔卢勒奥的各个基地降落。
