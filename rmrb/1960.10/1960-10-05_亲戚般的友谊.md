    Kin-like Friendship
    Jian Bozan

    These past few days, the entire city of Beijing has been transformed into an ocean of joy. All the residents of this city are welcoming our 11th National Day anniversary with extraordinary excitement. At the airport, train station, and wide avenues, crowds of joyful people are everywhere, enthusiastically welcoming friends from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other countries around the world, all here to celebrate our 11th National Day.

    In these joyous days, our respected friends Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, and the more than 300 distinguished members of the Burmese delegation have arrived in Beijing one after another. These distinguished guests from Burma have received a warm welcome from the Chinese people. As their motorcade passed through the crowds, thunderous applause and cries of "Long Live Sino-Burmese Friendship" resounded through the skies.

    The Chinese people's warm welcome to the distinguished Burmese guests is understandable. First, these guests have brought us the most precious gift: the kin-like friendship of the Burmese people. More importantly, the prime ministers of China and Burma signed the historically significant Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty on our National Day. The signing of this treaty not only establishes a new milestone in the history of Sino-Burmese friendly relations but also serves as a good example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

    As Premier Zhou Enlai said: "This treaty is the first boundary treaty signed by two Asian countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit, and in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation. The signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty will make the border between the two countries a peaceful and friendly border, and further develop the friendly relations and the traditional, kin-like friendship between the two peoples."

    The kin-like friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples is very ancient. The earliest relationship can be traced back more than two thousand years. As early as the end of the second century BC, commercial exchange relations existed between China and Burma. Zhang Qian, the envoy dispatched by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty to Central Asia, saw Shu brocade and Qiong bamboo canes in the markets of Bactria. These silk fabrics and handicrafts undoubtedly reached Central Asia through the hands of the Burmese and Indian people. By the beginning of the second century AD, there was direct contact between the governments of China and Burma. According to historical records, in the year 120 AD (the first year of Yongning under Emperor An of the Han Dynasty), King Yongyoutiao of the Shan State in ancient Burma sent an art troupe to visit Luoyang, the capital of China at that time. After the fourth century, many Chinese monks visited Burma and traveled through Burma to India during the Gupta dynasty. In the year 802 AD (the eighteenth year of Zhenyuan under Emperor Dezong of the Tang Dynasty), King Yong Qiang of the ancient Burmese Pyu Kingdom also sent an art troupe headed by Prince Shunan Tuo to visit Chang'an, the capital of our Tang Dynasty, where they gave wonderful performances. The Tang Dynasty poet Bai Juyi wrote a poem "Pyu Music" praising the troupe's performance. After the twelfth century, the Pagan Dynasty of Burma successively sent envoys to visit Bianliang, the capital of our Northern Song Dynasty, and Lin'an, the capital of the Southern Song Dynasty. Later, the Ava Dynasty of Burma and our Ming Dynasty, the Toungoo Dynasty of Burma and our Qing Dynasty all had frequent trade relations and cultural exchanges. It was not until the second half of the nineteenth century, when China and Burma were successively subjected to imperialist aggression, that this traditional friendly relationship was damaged. However, the traditional friendship between the two peoples could not be severed. When the Chinese and Burmese peoples eliminated imperialist rule from their own lands and achieved independence as nation-states, this friendship quickly resumed and developed on a new historical basis. In short, the historical relationship between China and Burma is long-standing and friendly. As Prime Minister U Nu said: "Throughout history, our two countries have maintained pleasant and sincere relations."

    More than two thousand years have passed, and the traditional kin-like friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples has grown day by day. It is precisely because China and Burma have a long-standing tradition of kin-like friendship that the friendly relations between our two countries can develop rapidly under new historical conditions. Of course, more importantly, the Chinese and Burmese peoples are both peace-loving peoples, and the Chinese and Burmese governments are both governments that implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Without this sincere desire for peace, the traditional kin-like friendship would not be respected, and might even be forgotten. Only when both sides respect the traditional kin-like friendship and have a sincere desire for peace can they build a new "edifice of friendship" as Prime Minister U Nu said, on the basis of this kin-like friendship. The Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty is precisely a new "edifice of friendship" built on the basis of this traditional kin-like friendship. Now that this new "edifice of friendship" has been completed, it is the realization of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between countries with different social systems, it is the victory of the Bandung spirit, and it is a symbol of the kin-like friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples. We warmly celebrate the completion of this "edifice of friendship" and celebrate the everlasting friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples.

    亲戚般的友谊
    翦伯赞
    这几天，整个北京变成了一个欢乐的海洋。所有这个城市的居民都怀着异乎寻常的兴奋来迎接我国建国十一周年国庆节。在飞机场、火车站和宽阔的马路上，到处都挤满了欢乐的人群，他们满怀热情迎接来自亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和其他世界各国的朋友，这些朋友都是来祝贺我国十一周年国庆节的。
    就在这个欢乐的日子里，中国人民尊敬的朋友吴努总理、奈温将军和缅甸访华代表团的三百多位贵宾先后来到了北京。这些来自缅甸的贵宾受到了中国人民热烈的欢迎，当他们的车队从人民群众的行列中穿过的时候，雷动的掌声和“中缅友好万岁”的呼声，响彻云霄。
    中国人民热烈地欢迎缅甸的贵宾是可以理解的，首先是这些贵宾替我们带来了最珍贵的礼物——缅甸人民的亲戚般的友谊，更重要的是中缅两国总理于我国国庆节那天签订了具有重大历史意义的中缅边界条约，而这个条约的签订，不但在中缅两国友好关系史上树立了一块新的里程碑，对于世界上不同社会制度国家的和平共处，也是一个良好的典范。
    正像周恩来总理所说的：“这个条约将是两个亚洲国家第一次在和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的基础上，并且根据互谅互让的精神所签订的边界条约。中缅边界条约的签订，将使两国的边界成为一条和平友好的边界，并且使两国的友好关系和两国人民传统的、亲戚般的友谊进一步发展。”
    中缅两国人民亲戚般的友谊是非常古远的。最早的关系可以追溯到两千多年前。早在公元前二世纪末，中缅两国就发生了商业交换关系。汉武帝派往中亚的使节张骞就在大夏市场上看到了蜀布、邛竹杖，这些丝织物和工艺品无疑地是通过缅甸和印度人民之手运到中亚去的。到了公元二世纪初，中缅两国政府就有了直接往来。根据历史的记载，公元120年（汉安帝永宁元年），古缅甸的掸邦国王雍由调派遣了一个艺术团来访问了当时中国的首都洛阳。四世纪以后，有很多中国的僧侣，访问了缅甸，并经由缅甸前往笈多王朝时期的印度。公元802年（唐德宗贞元十八年）古缅甸的骠国国王雍羌又派遣了一个以舒难陀亲王为首的艺术团来访问我国唐朝的首都长安，在长安作了精彩的表演，唐代的诗人白居易曾经写了一首
  “骠国乐”的诗，赞扬这个艺术团的演出。十二世纪以后，缅甸的蒲甘王朝曾先后派遣使节访问了我国北宋王朝的首都汴梁和南宋王朝的首都临安，以后缅甸的阿瓦王朝和我国明朝，缅甸的洞吾王朝和我国清朝都有着频繁的贸易关系和文化往来。一直到十九世纪下半期，中缅两国先后遭受帝国主义的侵略，这种传统的友好关系才受到损害。但是两国人民之间的传统的友谊是割不断的，当中缅两国人民，从自己的土地上消灭了帝国主义的统治，获得民族国家的独立以后，这种友谊又在新的历史基础上，很快地恢复和发展起来了。总之，中缅两国历史关系是悠久的、友好的，正像吴努总理所说的：“我们两国在整个历史中一直保持着愉快和真诚的关系”。
    两千多年的时间已经过去了，中缅两国人民之间的传统的亲戚般友谊则与日俱增。正是由于中缅两国具有悠久历史传统的亲戚般的友谊，我们两国的友好关系才能迅速地在新的历史条件下发展起来。当然，更重要的是中缅两国人民都是爱好和平的人民，中缅两国政府都是执行和平共处五项原则的政府，没有这种爱好和平的真诚的愿望，传统的亲戚般的友谊也会不被尊重的，甚至会很有可能被忘记的。只有双方都尊重传统的亲戚般的友谊，而又有爱好和平的真诚愿望，才能在亲戚友谊的基地上建立起像吴努总理所说的新的“友谊大厦”。中缅边界条约正是在这种传统的亲戚般友谊的基地上建立起来的一座新的“友谊大厦”。现在这座新的“友谊大厦”已经落成，这是不同社会制度国家和平共处五项原则的实现，是万隆精神的胜利，是中缅两国人民亲戚般友谊的象征。我们热烈地庆祝这座“友谊大厦”的落成，庆祝中缅两国人民的友谊万古长存。
