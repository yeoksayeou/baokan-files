    CPC Central Committee Sends Telegram to the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea to Congratulate the 15th Anniversary of the Founding of the Workers' Party of Korea
To the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea:

    On behalf of all party members and the entire Chinese people, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China warmly congratulates the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea.

    Over the past fifteen years, under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people have established a system of people's democratic dictatorship in the northern half of Korea, repelled the aggression of US imperialism, carried out socialist transformation and socialist construction, thereby transforming the northern half of Korea into a socialist industrial-agricultural country, and have made unremitting efforts to realize the peaceful reunification of Korea. At present, inspired by the glorious prospect of the Seven-Year Plan put forward by the Workers' Party of Korea, the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are launching a nationwide Chollima Movement, advancing from one victory to another.

    The fifteen-year history of the Workers' Party of Korea fully proves that it is the inspirer, organizer, and leader of the Korean people in achieving all victories. The Communist Party of China warmly congratulates the Workers' Party of Korea on achieving new and greater achievements in leading the Korean people in the struggle against US imperialism and for the peaceful reunification of Korea, in accelerating the cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction, and in the struggle to defend peace in Asia and the world.

    Long live the unbreakable fraternal unity between the two parties and two peoples of China and Korea!
    Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live invincible Marxism-Leninism!

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    October 9, 1960
