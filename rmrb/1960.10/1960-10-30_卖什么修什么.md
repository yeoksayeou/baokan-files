Beijing Street Scene:

    Sell What You Repair, Repair What You Sell

    In recent days, the Lisheng Sporting Goods Store in Bameicao has been crowded with groups of people from government offices, enterprises, schools, organizations, and sports enthusiasts. Some were happily walking out with piles of basketballs, footballs, and various rackets in their hands, while others were hurrying in with large bags of sportswear and various balls. The majority of them came for repairs.

    A student from Beijing No. 15 Middle School was holding nine repaired basketballs and volleyballs in his arms. Some of these balls had lost their outer leather, and some had burst bladders. These items had been sitting in the corner of the club for several years. Now, they have all been repaired for very little money. A sportsman named Guan brought a large bag of绒衣绒衣 (róngyī - flannelette clothes) and said to the shop assistant: "All four of my绒衣绒衣 (róngyī - flannelette clothes) are broken. Some have torn collars and cuffs, and two have broken from the middle of the sleeves. I don't know if they can be repaired?" Shop assistant Lao Chen opened them up and said with confidence: "No problem." Two days later, this customer was satisfied to receive the four repaired绒衣绒衣 (róngyī - flannelette clothes).

    The store has a wide range of repair services, including inflating balls, patching bladders, repairing various jump ropes and balls, replacing shafts for javelins, restringing tennis and badminton rackets, and replacing sleeves and collars for various sportswear... It can truly be said that they repair what they sell and sell what they repair. In just one month, they have repaired more than 790 pieces of various sports equipment for customers, which has been warmly praised by the majority of customers.

    卖什么修什么
    最近几天，八面槽利生体育用品商店里挤满了一群群来自机关、企业、学校、团体和体育爱好者，有的手里拿着一大堆篮球足球和各种球拍喜笑颜开地往外走。有的提着一大包运动衣和各种球类急匆匆地往里走。他们大部分都是来修理的。
    北京市十五中一位同学，两手抱着修理好的九个篮、排球，这些球有的护胆皮掉了，有的胆破了，这些东西几年来一直搁在俱乐部的角落里。现在，只花了很少的钱，就全部修好了。一位姓关的运动员，提着一大包绒衣向售货员同志说：我的四件绒衣全坏了，有的破了领口、袖口，还有两件从半节袖子坏了，不知道能否再修补一下？售货员老陈打开一看，满有把握地说：没有问题。两天后，这位顾客满意地取得修补好的四件绒衣。
    这个商店的修理项目可多，有球打气，补球胆，各种跳绳和球类的修理，有标枪的换杆、网球、羽毛球拍的换弦，还有各种运动衣服的换袖换领……真可以说是卖什么修什么。仅仅一个月，他们就为顾客们修理了各种体育用具七百九十余件，受到了广大顾客的热烈赞扬。（这个专栏是本报北京记者采写的）（附图片）
