    More Convenience for the Masses, Savings for Society
    Beijing Launches Clothing Alteration and Repair Services
    According to Beijing Daily News, Beijing's commercial and repair service industries are vigorously developing clothing and knitted cotton fabric alteration, renovation, washing, and mending services, which are well-received by the masses.
    Since the Party Central Committee issued the call to launch a production increase and economy drive centered on grain and steel, the staff of Beijing's commercial and repair service industries, through study and discussion, have further clarified the understanding that expanding repair services can not only facilitate the masses but also save various materials for the country. Various units have adjusted their labor organization, deploying manpower and equipment to carry out renovation and alteration, washing, and mending services. So far, more than 260 service points have been set up in the four urban districts. In addition to professional repair shops established in Wangfujing Street, Xidan, Caishikou and other places, some larger shopping malls, factories, and schools have also established service points; clothing and dyeing shops and street service stations in streets and alleys have also generally carried out renovation and alteration services.
    In order to rationally use manpower and equipment and to meet the repair needs of customers as much as possible, the commercial and repair service industries have also carried out one-stop major collaboration with street service stations and other relevant departments. For example, shops accept work, sewing cooperatives are responsible for alteration and mending, dyeing shops are responsible for washing and dyeing, and resident service stations cooperate to do some technically simple work. The clothing processing department of the Tonghexiang Cloth Shop in Dongcheng District has achieved good results by adopting this method, renovating more than 300 pieces of old clothing for customers in a week. The Municipal Department Store Wholesale Company and seven knitted wool fabric factories cooperated extensively, sending technicians to carry out repair services, and setting up service points in 23 government offices, factories, and 15 large shopping malls, repairing more than 3,000 pieces of woolen sweaters, vests, and cotton underwear in a few days.
    In carrying out this business, processing and repair personnel have been doing everything possible to improve cutting and sewing methods, carefully calculating and saving materials for customers, and restoring old clothes to look like new. The staff of the Wangfujing Renovation and Alteration Shop in Dongcheng District can transform outdated old clothes into novel and beautiful garments through careful calculation, clever cutting, and skillful sewing.
    Repair service departments have also tried every means to shorten the delivery time by improving labor organization and increasing work efficiency. Some units have also set up express repair departments, repairing small jobs on the spot and urgent jobs in a timely manner. In order to save customers' travel time, some units have also carried out door-to-door service activities for government offices and organizations, managing the pick-up and delivery of repairs, which customers find very convenient.

    多方便利群众　节约社会财富
    北京开展服装翻改修补业务
    据北京日报消息　北京市商业和修理服务业大力开展服装和针棉织品的翻旧改新和拆洗缝补业务，受到了广大群众的欢迎。
    党中央提出开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的号召以后，北京市商业和修理服务业的职工通过学习讨论，进一步明确认识了扩大修理业务不仅可以方便群众，还能为国家节约各种物资。各单位纷纷调整劳动组织，抽调人力和设备，开展翻旧改新和拆洗缝补业务。到目前为止，城区四个区已设有二百六十多个应活点。除王府井大街、西单、菜市口等处建立了专业的修补门市部以外，一些较大的商场、工厂、学校也都建立了应活点；街头巷尾的服装、洗染商店和街道服务站，也普遍开展了翻旧改新业务。
    为了合理使用人力、设备，尽量满足顾客修补需要，商业和修理服务业还和街道服务站以及其他有关部门，开展了一条龙大协作。如商店应活，缝纫社负责拆改缝补，洗染店承担洗染，居民服务站配合作一些技术简单的活。东城区同和祥布店的服装加工部采用这种办法效果很好，一周内就为顾客翻修了三百多件旧衣。市百货批发公司和七个针毛织品工厂大搞协作，抽出技工开展修补业务，在二十三个机关、工厂和十五个大商场设立了应活点，几天时间就修补了绒衣、背心、棉毛衫裤三千多件。
    在开展这项业务中，加工修理人员都千方百计地改进裁剪缝补方法，为顾客精打细算、节约用料，整旧如新。东城区王府井翻旧改新门市部的职工，通过精打细算、巧裁巧缝，能把过时的旧衣服改成新颖美观的服装。
    修理服务部门还用改进劳动组织、提高工作效率等办法，千方百计地缩短交活时间。有的单位还成立了快修部，小活当时修，急活及时修理。为了节省顾客跑路的时间，有的单位还对机关团体开展了上门服务的活动，修理的活管取管送，顾客感到很方便。
