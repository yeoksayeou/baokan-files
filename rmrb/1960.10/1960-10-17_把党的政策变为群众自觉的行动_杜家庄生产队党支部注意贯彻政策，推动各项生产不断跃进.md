This newspaper reports: The Dujiazhuang Production Team Party Branch of the Zongzhai Commune in Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province, in its leadership of production, promptly conveys the Party's various policies and measures for developing agricultural production in rural areas to the masses, allowing policies to directly meet the masses. This ensures a thorough implementation of policies, fully mobilizing the masses' enthusiasm for labor and promoting production and work.

Zhang Bingwei, the Party Branch Secretary of this production team, has gained a crucial experience in his eleven years of work: things go well when the masses understand the policies. Therefore, he always promptly conveys the Party's policies and propositions to the masses, enabling the masses to grasp the policies and turn them into conscious actions. At the beginning of this year, Gao Feng, the First Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, convened a forum with some production team cadres, which Zhang Bingwei also attended. At the meeting, Comrade Gao Feng further explained the Party's policy of "multiple crops and high yields" and put forward the requirement for timely early planting. To ensure that the Party's proposition would meet the masses sooner and quickly become their actions, Zhang Bingwei rushed back to the production team from Xining on the night the forum ended. On his way, when passing the Sixth Team, he thoroughly conveyed the policy of "multiple crops and high yields" to the team's cadres and masses and promoted the benefits of timely early planting. During this period, Zhang Bingwei went wherever he could to publicize the spirit of the meeting, deeply rooting the Party's policies and propositions in the hearts of the people. During discussions, the masses said that only by implementing the policy of "multiple crops and high yields" could they harvest more grain. Some said, "Planting one day early means harvesting ten days early"; others said, "Early planting is like business that comes to your door." After the Party's policies became the conscious actions of the masses, an immeasurable force was generated. The masses proposed transferring manpower and animal power from the sideline production team to rush fertilizers and launch a shock spring plowing campaign, putting more than 80% of the labor force into spring plowing.

Before the autumn harvest began, the Party branch again earnestly conveyed to the masses the Party's instruction to concentrate labor in the fields and launch a shock autumn harvest, which was well received by the masses. Some said, "When the fields turn yellow, seize the time to harvest," autumn harvest is the most important; others said, "A year's crops require a year's work," and the method of harvesting and plowing simultaneously is good. Commune members engaged in industry and sideline occupations also actively participated in the rush harvest. Cooks and feeders rationally arranged their work and also squeezed out manpower to go to the fields. As a result, the labor force engaged in field production increased from the original 80% of the total labor force to 91%, enabling the autumn harvest task to be completed ahead of schedule.

The key to this production team's ability to rapidly and thoroughly implement the Party's various policies among the masses lies in the team cadres' conscientious study of the Party's policies and listening to the Party in everything. Party Branch Secretary Zhang Bingwei keeps a tight grip on the study of the Party's policies. Every time he goes to a meeting at a higher level, he pays close attention to listening to the communication reports on the Party's policies, remembering them firmly, studying them, and publicizing and explaining them to the masses. He said: Listening to policies at meetings makes me more energetic, and things go well when the policies are understood. In addition to listening to the communication from higher levels, he also makes time to read documents and newspapers and often organizes Party members and cadres to collectively study policies, discuss them together, jointly understand the spirit of the policies, and act in accordance with the Party's policies. For example, in February this year, Wang Shoulin, the captain of the Third Team, proposed abolishing private plots. In order to ensure that everyone had a unified understanding of this issue, the Party branch organized cadres to discuss the relevant policies of the People's Commune. Through discussion, everyone agreed that at the current stage, retaining private plots for commune members in accordance with the prescribed proportion plays a certain role in developing livestock and poultry and encouraging commune members' enthusiasm for production, and should not be abolished. Some team leaders also cited examples to show that as long as arrangements are made well, commune members can manage their private plots well by using their morning and evening rest time and holidays without affecting collective production. Through discussion, the policy level of the team cadres was further improved, and they persisted in implementing the People's Commune's policy of retaining private plots for commune members and allowing private plot income to belong to individuals. It was also stipulated that when commune members sell vegetables grown in their private plots to the canteen, they must be paid in cash and not allowed to be owed, so that the policy can be effectively cashed. This year, commune members grew a lot of vegetables in their private plots. Now, every household has dried vegetables and pickled vegetables, and many commune members also sell fresh vegetables to the canteen, which has played a positive role in improving the lives of commune members.

### 把党的政策变为群众自觉的行动  杜家庄生产队党支部注意贯彻政策，推动各项生产不断跃进

    把党的政策变为群众自觉的行动
    杜家庄生产队党支部注意贯彻政策，推动各项生产不断跃进
    本报讯　青海省湟中县总寨公社杜家庄生产队党支部在领导生产中，对于党在农村的各项政策和发展农业生产的措施，都及时向群众传达，让政策直接与群众见面，使政策贯彻得深透，充分调动了群众的劳动积极性，推动了生产和工作。
    这个生产队的党支部书记张秉伟，在十一年的工作中，有了一条最重要的经验，就是：群众把政策弄明白了，事情就好办了。所以他在工作中总是及时向群众传达党的政策和主张，使政策为群众所掌握，变成群众的自觉行动。今年年初，青海省委第一书记高峰同志，召开部分生产队干部举行座谈，张秉伟也参加了座谈会。会上，高峰同志进一步讲解了党的多种多收和高产多收的方针，并且提出了及时早播的要求。为了使党的主张早一天同群众见面，迅速变成群众的行动，张秉伟在座谈会结束的当天夜里，就从西宁赶回生产队。途中路过第六小队时，他就向小队干部和群众，深入传达了多种多收和高产多收的方针，并宣传了适时早播的好处。这期间，张秉伟走到哪里，就把会议精神宣传到哪里，使党的政策和主张深入人心。群众在讨论中，都说只有执行多种多收和高产多收的方针，才能打更多的粮食。有的说：“早种一日，早收十天”；有的说“上门的买卖、早种的田”。党的政策，变成群众的自觉行动以后，便产生了不可估计的力量。群众提出从副业队调回人力和畜力，抢运肥料，突击春耕，使80％以上的劳力投入春耕。
    秋收开始前，党支部又认真地向群众传达了党提出的把劳动力集中田间、突击秋收的指示，群众反映很好。有的说：“田黄一时，龙口夺食”，秋收最要紧；有的说：“一年庄稼全年务劳”，随收随翻办法好。搞工业和搞副业的社员，也积极主动地参加抢收，炊事员和饲养员合理安排了工作，也挤出人力到田间。这样，在田间生产的劳力，由原先占总劳力的80％，提高到91％，使秋收任务提前完成。
    这个生产队所以能把党的各项政策，迅速深透地贯彻到群众中去，关键在于队干部认真地学习党的政策，事事听党的话。党支部书记张秉伟，对党的政策学习抓得很紧。他每次到上级开会，都十分注意听对党的政策的传达报告，并牢牢记在心里，加以研究，向群众宣传解释。他说：开会听政策，越听越有劲，政策弄明白，事情才好办。除了听取上级的传达以外，他还挤出时间阅读文件、报纸，并经常组织党员和干部集体学习政策，大家一起讨论，共同领会政策精神，按照党的政策办事。如今年2月间，第三小队队长王守林，提出取消自留地的意见。为了使大家对这一问题有统一的认识，党支部便组织干部讨论了人民公社的有关政策。通过讨论，大家一致认为：在现阶段按规定比例给社员留有自留地，对发展家畜家禽，鼓励社员生产积极性，有一定的作用，不应取消。有的小队长还列举实例，说明只要安排得好，社员利用早晚休息时间和假日，就可以务好自留地，不会影响集体生产。通过讨论，进一步提高了队干部的政策水平，坚持执行人民公社给社员留自留地、自留地收入归个人的政策。并规定社员自留地种的蔬菜卖给食堂时，都付现款，不许赊欠，使政策切实兑现。今年社员自留地里种的蔬菜很多，现在每户社员都晒有干菜，腌有咸菜，许多社员还把鲜菜卖给食堂，对改善社员生活起了积极作用。
