Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd. Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, today sent a telegram to the Cuban Workers' Federation, saying that Chinese workers strongly condemn the new conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to impose a comprehensive "embargo" on Cuba, attempting to strangle the Cuban revolution with economic blockade, and reiterate their full support for the heroic Cuban people in their just struggle to safeguard national independence, develop the national economy, and oppose U.S. imperialism.

The telegram said: We firmly believe that the U.S. imperialist "embargo," like its other defeated acts of aggression, will not only fail to stop the Cuban revolution from continuing to advance but, on the contrary, will further strengthen the Cuban people's determination to rely on their own efforts to overcome various difficulties, thereby making the Cuban economy develop more rapidly and healthily. The heroic Cuban people will certainly continue to strengthen unity, persevere in struggle, deal a heavier blow to all kinds of U.S. imperialist interference and aggression, and constantly achieve new victories.

    新华社22日讯　中华全国总工会主席刘宁一今天致电古巴工人联合会说，中国工人强烈谴责美帝国主义对古巴实行全面“禁运”、妄图用经济封锁扼杀古巴革命的新阴谋，重申全力支持英雄的古巴人民维护民族独立、发展民族经济和反对美帝国主义的正义斗争。
    电报说，我们深信，美帝国主义的“禁运”将和它已被击败的其他侵略活动一样，不仅不能阻挡古巴革命继续前进，相反地，将进一步加强古巴人民自力更生、克服各种困难的决心，从而使古巴经济更加迅速和健康地发展。英雄的古巴人民一定会继续加强团结，坚持斗争，给美帝国主义的各种干涉和侵略活动以更加沉重的打击，不断取得新的胜利。
