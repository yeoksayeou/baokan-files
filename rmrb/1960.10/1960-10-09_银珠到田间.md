　　Silver Beads to the Fields
　　Silver beads, each one bright and round, (Note)
　　Shine like silver threads under the electric lights.
　　Silver beads piled up like mountains,
　　Trains shuttle back and forth, transporting them endlessly.
　　Silver beads flow steadily to the fields,
　　The seedlings in the fields smile happily.
　　Silver beads are scattered, and the seedlings grow strong,
　　This year will be another year of bumper harvest.

　　Note: The chemical fertilizer ammonium nitrate is in the form of white granules, commonly known as silver beads.

    银珠到田间银珠粒粒亮又圆，（注）电灯光下射银线。银珠堆积如山大，火车穿梭运不完。银珠源源到田间，田间禾苗笑开颜。银珠撒下禾苗壮，今年又是丰收年。注：化学肥料硝铵呈白色颗粒状，俗称银珠。
