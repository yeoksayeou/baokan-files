An important measure for increasing agricultural production, a crucial step towards achieving three harvests a year:

Guangdong Expands Winter Planting and Advances the Winter Planting Season

The province has already sown over eight million mu of winter crops, including over six million mu of grain crops.

(Our dispatch from Guangzhou, October 26th) Under the new situation of the whole Party and all the people engaging in agriculture and large-scale grain production, Guangdong Province has launched a vigorous mass movement to advance winter planting, expand winter planting, and strive for increased production and greater harvests of winter crops throughout the province. As of the 20th, the province had sown over 8.3 million mu of winter crops, of which grain crops accounted for over 6.5 million mu.

Engaging in large-scale winter planting is an important measure for Guangdong Province to achieve increased agricultural production. Guangdong Province is located in the tropical and subtropical zones and has superior natural conditions for achieving three harvests a year. Experience over the years has proven that advancing winter planting is a crucial step towards achieving three harvests a year. To this end, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China took early measures, transferring over 1.4 million laborers to the forefront of agricultural production, sending over 100,000 cadres to the front lines to strengthen leadership and participate in labor, and requiring all regions to rush to sow some or most of the winter crops before the autumn harvest, and then complete all winter planting tasks in one go after the autumn harvest. This will better arrange the labor force, plant as many winter crops as possible, plant all the land that can be winter-planted, and, without affecting next year's spring plowing, appropriately extend the crop growing season to achieve high yields and abundant harvests. This measure has been warmly supported by the vast number of cadres and the masses, and a winter planting upsurge has quickly swept the province.

In the large-scale winter planting movement, all regions have implemented the principle of giving priority to grain, while also planting oil crops, vegetables, green manure, and other cash crops on a large scale. In the southern regions with less frost and higher temperatures, the focus is generally on planting high-yield overwintering sweet potatoes. In some areas near the northern mountainous regions, the focus is on planting beans and relatively cold-resistant wheat and barley. In the northern mountainous areas with more frost, the focus is on planting cold-resistant crops such as rapeseed, green manure, and beans. In order to rush to plant sweet potatoes, wheat, and other crops with longer growing seasons before autumn, all regions, in addition to seizing the opportunity to harvest early-maturing crops such as peanuts and soybeans as quickly as possible to free up land, mainly adopted methods such as large-scale intercropping, mixed cropping, and full utilization of all scattered plots of land, undeveloped wasteland, and newly reclaimed land. For vegetables, green manure, and other crops with shorter growing seasons, all regions generally arrange for planting after autumn. Through specific planning and comprehensive arrangements, many regions plan to increase the area of winter planting this year by more than half or even double compared to last year. Some areas that mainly grow cash crops, such as the mulberry and pond areas in Shunde County, and the sandy fields in the Pearl River Delta, which have never had the habit of winter planting, have also launched a large-scale winter planting upsurge this year. At present, leading cadres at all levels in Guangdong have gone deep into the forefront of production to strengthen leadership over winter planting; many organs, troops, industrial and mining enterprises, and schools in various regions have also actively joined the winter planting movement.

    农业增产的重要措施　一年三熟的重要一着
    广东扩大冬种提早冬种
    全省已种下冬作物八百多万亩，其中粮食作物六百多万亩
    本报广州26日电　广东省在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的新形势下，一个提早冬种、扩大冬种、力争冬作物增产多收的群众运动，已在全省范围内蓬勃展开。到20日止，全省已经种下冬作物八百三十多万亩，其中粮食作物占六百五十多万亩。
    大搞冬种是广东省实现农业增产的一项重要措施。广东省地处热带和亚热带，具有实现一年三熟的优越自然条件。从多年来的经验证明，提早冬种，则是实现一年三熟的重要的一着。为此，中共广东省委及早采取措施，向农业生产第一线增调了一百四十多万名劳动力，下放了十万多名干部到第一线加强领导和参加劳动，并且要求各地在秋收前抢先种下一部分或大部分冬作物，秋收后再一鼓作气，完成全部冬种任务。这样就可以更好地安排劳动力，尽量多种冬作物，把一切能够冬种的土地全部种上去，而且又能在不影响明年春耕的条件下，适当延长作物生长时间，实现高产多收。这个措施，受到广大干部和群众的热烈拥护，全省迅速掀起了冬种高潮。
    在大搞冬种运动中，各地都贯彻了以粮食为主，同时大种油料、蔬菜、绿肥和其他经济作物的方针。在南部霜冻较少、气温较高的地区，一般以种植高产的越冬番薯为主；在靠近北部山区的一些地区，以种植豆类和比较耐寒的大、小麦为主；在霜冻较多的北部山区，则以种植油菜、绿肥和豆类等耐寒作物为主。为了把番薯、小麦等生长期较长的作物在秋前抢种下去，各地除了抓紧抢收花生、黄豆等早熟作物，以便尽快腾出土地之外，主要是采取大搞套种、间种和充分利用一切零星土地、生熟荒地，以及开荒扩种等办法。对于蔬菜、绿肥等生长期较短的作物，各地一般安排在秋后种植。通过具体的规划和全面的安排，不少地区今年计划冬种的面积比去年增加了一半以至一倍以上。一些以种植经济作物为主如顺德县的桑、塘地区和一向没有冬种习惯的珠江三角洲的沙田地区，今年也掀起了大搞冬种的热潮。目前，广东各级领导干部都已深入生产第一线，加强对冬种的领导；许多地区的机关、部队、工矿、企业、学校，也积极投入了冬种运动。
