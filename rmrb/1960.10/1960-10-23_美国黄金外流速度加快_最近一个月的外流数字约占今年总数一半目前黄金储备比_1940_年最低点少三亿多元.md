Xinhua News Agency, New York, 21st: The outflow of American gold continues to develop recently. According to an announcement by the US Federal Reserve Bank yesterday, the US gold reserve had decreased to $18,581,000,000 by the 19th.

Since the beginning of this year, the total amount of American gold outflow has reached $875 million. Nearly one-half of this amount, namely $418 million, has flowed out in the month or so from early September until now. This shows that the recent outflow of US gold is developing at a much higher rate than before September.

In early September this year, the US gold reserve fell below $19 billion for the first time in twenty years, reaching $18,999,000,000, but it was still higher than the low point of $18,949,000,000 on May 15, 1940.

However, since then, another $418 million in gold has flowed out of the United States, which means that the current US gold reserve is $368.8 million less than the lowest point in 1940.

    美国黄金外流速度加快
    最近一个月的外流数字约占今年总数一半目前黄金储备比1940年最低点少三亿多元
    新华社21日讯　纽约消息：最近美国黄金流外继续发展。据美国联邦储备银行昨天宣布，美国的黄金储备到19日为止，已经下降到一百八十五亿八千一百万美元。
    今年以来，美国外流的黄金总数已经达到八亿七千五百万美元。其中有将近二分之一，即四亿一千八百万美元是9月上旬以后到现在一个多月的时间里流出的。这说明最近美国黄金外流正在比9月份以前高得多的速度发展着。
    今年9月上旬，美国黄金储备二十年来第一次下降到一百九十亿美元以下，达到一百八十九亿九千九百万美元，但还高于1940年5月15日的一百八十九亿四千九百万美元的最低点。
    但是从那以后，又有四亿一千八百万美元的黄金流出美国，这使美国目前黄金储备额比1940年时的最低点还少三亿六千八百万美元。
