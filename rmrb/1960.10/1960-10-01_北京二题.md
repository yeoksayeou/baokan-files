    Two Themes of Beijing
    Guo Feng
    The Flagpole on Tiananmen Square
    The tall flagpole, as if carved from flawless white jade, stands on the vast Tiananmen Square;
    More intense than flames erupting from a volcano, brighter than the sun at noon, our Five-Star Red Flag flutters above the flagpole, in the sky above Tiananmen Square, welcoming the east wind of Beijing,迎着迎 the east wind of our century.
    Ah! Are they foreign guests who have traveled a long way from the other side of the earth to come here? Their skin has the black crystal-like luster of miners in the germanium mines of the Congo River basin; their eyes hold the wisdom and perseverance of farmers in the sugarcane fields near Havana and guerrillas in the Sierra Maestra mountains. The red flag above Tiananmen Square flutters vigorously. They come from the storms of the anti-colonialist revolutionary struggle, as if arriving in the homeland of the revolution. They stand in front of the flagpole on the square, reluctant to leave for a long time; they stand there, with deep affection and profound respect. The red flag above Tiananmen Square is fluttering. They think of the sweetness of freedom liberated from the shackles of enslavement; they think of the pride and greatest glory of being free from the humiliation of struggle.
    They receive the most steadfast inspiration on the road of advancing in the struggle, they absorb the greatest support for victory, and they realize the most certain source of happiness.
    From here, they receive the greatest truth of carrying the revolution through to the end, and receive the strong belief in victory and the permanent encouragement of victory.
    They stand in front of the flagpole on Tiananmen Square, with deep affection and profound respect. The tall flagpole, as if carved from flawless white jade, stands on Tiananmen Square, and the red flag above the flagpole welcomes the east wind of Beijing, welcoming the east wind of our century.
    The Lamp Posts of Chang'an Avenue
    In the daytime, they are countless huge white magnolias, white snowball flowers, white lotus flowers, white lilies, forming countless huge flower trees, rows of countless flower trees (each of their flowers has a huge golden calyx);
    In the daytime, they and the verdant pine trees in front of the red palace walls, the beautiful maple trees, Floss Silk Trees, the locust trees that bloom with strings of white flowers in the summer, and the straight poplar trees that can be seen everywhere in the north, together form an incomparably magnificent procession, arranged as the floral honor guard of our capital, paying tribute to the capital.
    At night, they are countless huge shining constellations, golden crystal constellations, golden glazed constellations, luminous agate and the most gigantic diamond constellations, forming a bright and glittering universe galaxy and the Great Milky Way;
    At night, they converge into the most brilliant Milky Way, flowing into Tiananmen Square, ah, becoming the most brilliant ocean composed of constellations. In this ocean, there is the majestic Tiananmen, the Tiananmen with our national emblem embedded on it, where our beloved leader Chairman Mao and other leaders of our Party and country stand to review the troops during festivals; in this ocean, there is the People's Heroes Monument, like white jade, and the People's Great Hall, like a jade palace...
    Ah, they are always flowers and constellations. They are the flowers and constellations of the people's labor and wisdom. They will always cheer for the victory of the people, the victory of the revolution, and the victory of the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. They are eternal victory, they are eternal beauty, eternal flowers and constellations.

    北京二题
    郭风
    天安门广场上的旗杆
    高大的，好像用无瑕的白玉雕成的旗杆，竖立在广阔的天安门广场上；
    比火山口迸发出来的火焰还强烈，比中午时刻的太阳还明亮，我们的五星红旗在旗杆上面，在天安门广场的上空，迎接着北京的东风，迎着我们这个世纪的东风在飘扬。
    啊！他们是从地球的那边路远迢迢地来到我们这里的外宾？他的肌肤，有刚果河流域锗矿矿工的黑水晶似的光泽；他的眼神里，有哈瓦那近郊甘蔗田里的农民和马埃斯特腊山区游击队员的智慧和坚毅。天安门广场上空的红旗在呼啦啦地飘扬。他们从反殖民主义的革命斗争的风暴中来，好像来到革命的故乡。他们站在广场的旗杆的前面，久久地舍不得离开；他们站在那里，怀着深情和深切的敬意。天安门广场上空的红旗在飘扬。他们想到从粉碎被奴役的枷锁里解放出来的自由的甘美；想到从斗争的鲜血里摆脱了屈辱的自豪感和最大的光荣。
    他们得到在斗争的前进的道路上最坚定的启示，他们吸取到胜利的最伟大的支持，他们领悟到幸福的最确切的泉源。
    他们从这里领受到把革命进行到底的最伟大的真理，领受胜利的坚强的信念和胜利的永久的鼓舞。
    他们站在天安门广场上的旗杆前面，怀着深情和深切的敬意。好像无瑕的白玉雕成的、高大的旗杆竖立在天安门广场上，旗杆上面的红旗，迎接着北京的东风，迎着我们这个世纪的东风在飘扬。
    长安街的灯柱
    白天，它们是无数巨大的雪白的玉兰花，雪白的绣球花，雪白的莲花，雪白的百合花，组成无数巨大的花树，无数花树的行列（它们的每朵花，都有巨大的金色花托）；
    白天，它们和红色的宫墙前面的苍翠的松树，美丽的枫树、马缨树，在夏天开着成串的白花的槐树，和笔直的在北方到处可见到的杨树，一起排列成无比壮丽的队伍，排列成为我们首都的花的仪仗队，向首都致敬。
    夜间，它们是无数巨大的闪光的星座，金色的水晶的星座，金色的琉璃的星座，发光的玛瑙的和最巨大的钻石的星座，组成花团锦簇的亮晶晶的宇宙星系和大银河；
    夜间，它们汇成最灿烂的银河，汇流到天安门广场，啊，成为星座组成的最灿烂的海洋。在这海洋里，有巍峨的天安门，那上面嵌着我们的国徽的天安门，在节日里，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席，我们的党和国家的其他领导人站在上面检阅的天安门；在这海洋里，有白玉般的竖立的人民英雄纪念碑，有琼楼玉宇般的人民大会堂，人民宫殿……
    啊，它们永远是花和星座。它们是人民的劳动和智慧的花和星座。它们永远欢呼人民的胜利，革命的胜利，党和毛主席的领导的胜利。它们是永恒的胜利，它们是永恒的美，永恒的花和星座。
