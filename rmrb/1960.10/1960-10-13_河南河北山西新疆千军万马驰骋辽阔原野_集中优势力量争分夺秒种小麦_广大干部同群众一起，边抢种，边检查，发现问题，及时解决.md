Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th: The mass movement to sow wheat in Henan Province has entered a high tide. As of the 6th, the province had planted more than 12.31 million mu of wheat. Early wheat planting in Xinxiang and Kaifeng regions and Zhengzhou city has been basically completed. Because preparations for wheat planting this year started early and were well-prepared, the sowing quality is generally good.

Focusing on weak links in high-yield areas is the biggest characteristic of this province's wheat sowing work. Meng County, famous for its large-area high-yield wheat, concentrated its superior forces to attack the three types of high-yield plots. In the Goucun Commune of this county, the 3,000 mu of high-yield wheat plots on Qingfeng Ridge had lower yields due to poor water and fertilizer conditions. They organized 500 commune members to repair and build 20 channels and drill 13 new wells to improve irrigation conditions. At the same time, 32 new tile-urn-style field fertilizer bases were built. After these efforts, the sowing quality of these 3,000 mu of wheat fields has exceeded the requirements of the second-class plots. In order to promote the experience of the province's wheat benchmark high-yield plots and consolidate and improve the general areas of high-yield plots, Luoyang region launched a study, catch-up, surpass, and help movement across the region, with the plains learning from "Yuetan" (Yuetan Brigade of Zhaizhen Commune in Yanshi County, a 10,000-mu wheat red flag plot) and the mountainous and hilly areas learning from "Jiliao" (Jiliao Commune's mountainous wheat red flag plot in Linru County). After learning from Yuetan's experience in applying sufficient base fertilizer, the cadres and members of the Guozhen Commune in Lingbao County applied more than twice as much base fertilizer to the commune's 10,000 mu of high-yield wheat plots as last year.

Widely establishing benchmarks and catching up with the advanced in low-yield areas is another characteristic of this province's wheat sowing this year. In their work, all localities have adopted different measures based on the different reasons for the formation of low yields. Wang Mijiang, Secretary of the CCP Minquan County Committee, personally led more than 100 cadres to the most alkaline Yejigong Commune and found ways to control alkalinity rise, such as washing alkali with water, suppressing alkali with sand, and deep plowing to discharge alkali, and then promoted it throughout the county. After visiting the Luoda Brigade, a brother brigade located in high mountains and steep slopes, which had built pig, sheep, and livestock pens in distant and barren fields to solve the difficulty of transporting base fertilizer to wheat fields, the members of the Hongyihe Commune in Tongbai County set off a wave of pigs, sheep, and livestock going to the mountains and building pens. More than 500 mu of wheat land in distant and barren fields in this commune have been applied with base fertilizer.

In order to ensure the quality of wheat sowing, all localities have generally implemented planting while inspecting, discovering problems while planting, and solving problems while planting. Many communes in Nanle County have also implemented a continuous responsibility system, in which plowing hands accept the quality of manure spreading, planting hands accept the quality of plowing, cadres accept the quality of planting, and the masses universally inspect, to ensure that wheat is planted adequately and well.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 12th: All parts of Hebei Province are seizing the opportunity after the rain to expand the wheat planting area and improve the sowing quality. The province's wheat planting movement has entered a high tide. As of October 6, the province had completed more than 58% of its winter wheat sowing task.

In late September, Hebei Province generally experienced rainfall, and soil moisture in general areas was relatively good. According to this favorable condition, the CCP Hebei Provincial Committee called on all localities to further implement the policy of planting more and harvesting more and achieving high yields and more harvests, and strive to plant more and plant well. Party committees at all levels actively responded to the call of the Provincial Committee, leading the masses to rush to sow winter wheat on the one hand, and specifically helping people's communes and production teams to expand the wheat planting area by all means. All localities have generally adopted the method of concentrating labor, animal power, and tools to strengthen the forces on the autumn sowing front and accelerate the sowing progress. According to statistics from the Tangshan, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang regions, the labor force currently engaged in wheat planting has increased by one million people compared with late September. The average daily progress of wheat planting in the province has reached 1.5 million mu, an increase of 87% compared with late September.

Focusing on weak links and ensuring timely planting of wheat well is a prominent feature of the wheat rushing planting movement in Hebei. After seeing the uneven progress of wheat planting in various places, the CCP Baoding Municipal Committee immediately organized cadres to go to areas with slow progress, assist local leaders in carrying out comprehensive inspections by commune and by team, and promptly solve various problems found in the inspections, so that these areas with slower wheat planting progress quickly set off a high tide of wheat planting. Li Sheng, First Secretary of the CCP Zhuozhou County Committee, and the four secretaries of the Secretariat, led more than 200 cadres to the eastern low-lying areas with large wheat planting tasks to help guide the wheat planting work, greatly accelerating the daily progress of wheat planting in this area. In order to strive to plant more wheat and complete the wheat planting plan in a balanced way, many communes and production teams also transferred manpower, animal power, and tools to help production teams with slow progress to rush to plant, accelerating the wheat planting progress of these production teams, based on the principle of equal exchange.

Many areas, in light of the situation that there are more late-autumn crops this year and the stubble is cleared later, have further thoroughly implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. All localities vigorously promote the experience of intercropping and relay planting, turning late-stubble wheat into early-stubble wheat, and adopting methods such as plowing and breaking up the soil, opening ditches to apply fertilizer, or applying seed fertilizer to improve the sowing quality of these wheat crops. Wheat fields throughout the province have generally been plowed before sowing, and the area of fertilization has reached more than 90%. The wheat that has been sown has been inspected and accepted. After the basic completion of the wheat sowing task, the CCP Tangshan Municipal Committee organized an inspection team of 110,000 cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers to go deep into the fields, inspect and discuss, and promptly mobilize the masses to remedy the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges. Many areas have also organized temporary professional seedling inspection and replanting teams to strengthen the management of seedlings.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th: People's communes in Shanxi Province have set off a high tide of winter wheat sowing centered on ensuring timeliness, ensuring area, and ensuring quality. The province's winter wheat sowing work has generally entered the final crucial stage. As of October 5, the labor force participating in wheat planting in various places has surged to more than 2 million people, and 55.9% of the planned winter wheat area in the province has been completed. In order to ensure timely sowing, people's communes in Jinzhong and Jinnan regions have put forward the slogan of completing the sowing task with quality and quantity before the Cold Dew and Frost's Descent periods. In the past few days, the winter wheat sowing work has been advancing at a rate of 500,000 mu per day.

In the decisive moment of winter wheat sowing, all localities are concentrating superior forces and seizing the time to rush to plant. In view of the characteristics of the large area of ​​summer replanting this year, all localities have arranged stubble in advance so that 95% of the replanting wheat in the province can be quickly implemented in cotton, beans, alfalfa, and other places; all localities have taken measures to remove the ineffective buds of cotton plants and the stalks and leaves of autumn grain crops to promote their early maturity and early stubble clearing; at the same time, they have concentrated their efforts to transport fertilizer to the wheat planting area. This has created favorable conditions for timely and good replanting of wheat.

In order to expand the wheat sowing area this year, all localities have removed the excessively wide roads in the high-yield plots and made full use of river beaches and wasteland for planting. In order to plant enough winter wheat well, people's communes in Jin Southeast region have generally implemented the method of "planting, inspecting, and replanting at the same time." After planting, they promptly organized special personnel to inspect, replant immediately when missing seedlings were found, and actively used the land to expand the winter wheat planting area by 80,000 mu, greatly improving the land utilization rate. Members of the Yongcheng People's Commune in Yangcheng County used riverbank land, gully cliff land, and sharp grass land to plant wheat, and expanded the winter wheat planting area by 860 mu in the last three days.

According to inspections in various places, the sowing quality of winter wheat in Shanxi Province this year is better than any previous year. The area of ​​deep plowing has been expanded, sufficient fertilizer has been applied, excellent varieties have been adopted, and reasonable close planting has been implemented. In Jin Southeast region, 60% of the wheat field area has generally been plowed three times. Yangcheng County organized more than 56,000 commune members, seized the opportunity after the rain to accumulate 1.05 million dan of fertilizer in two days, and transported it to the ground in time, ensuring the needs of wheat planting.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 12th: The whole party and the whole people of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are seizing the favorable season before the Frost's Descent to rush to plant winter wheat. In the past few days, the daily sowing progress in the region has reached more than 400,000 mu. As of October 5, the wheat planting area in the region has approached the total number of plantings last year. Among them, Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture and 11 counties including Nilek and Emin have overfulfilled the winter wheat planting plan.

The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region plans to sow more than 50% more winter wheat this year than last year. In order to overfulfill the autumn sowing plan, according to the instructions of the Regional Party Committee, the autonomous region-level organs have transferred 39 responsible cadres, including the secretary of the Party Committee and ministers, and more than 7,600 cadres from various provincial organs to organize a large autumn sowing labor force. Led by Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Regional Party Committee, they went to Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, which has a large autumn sowing area and a small labor force, to participate in production and lead production. The Party committees at all levels in the autonomous prefectures and counties, headed by the First Secretary, have also organized about 90% of the cadres and some urban population to support the winter wheat sowing work. In Hotan region, Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, and Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture, more than 130,000 people have supported winter wheat sowing work.

After the First Secretaries of Party committees at all levels led the vast number of cadres to go deep into the front line of autumn sowing, they greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of basic-level cadres and commune members and accelerated the progress of winter wheat sowing. Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Regional Party Committee, led more than 7,000 cadres to go deep into the production teams of Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, increasing the daily sowing progress here from more than 28,000 mu in the previous few days to more than 100,000 mu. Under the specific leadership of Party committee secretaries at all levels, the winter wheat planting area in Tacheng region by October 6 had exceeded about twice the winter wheat planting area last year.

Because Party committees at all levels grasped tightly and grasped firmly, the quality of winter wheat sowing this year is also better than in previous years. Many communes have increased the area of ​​deep plowing and sowing with row planters by one time compared with last year. They have also done better than in previous years in applying more base fertilizer, selecting fine seeds, and treating seeds with pesticides. (Attached photo)

    河南河北山西新疆千军万马驰骋辽阔原野
    集中优势力量争分夺秒种小麦
    广大干部同群众一起，边抢种，边检查，发现问题，及时解决
    据新华社郑州12日电　河南省播种小麦的群众运动已经进入高潮。到6日止，全省已种小麦一千二百三十一万多亩，新乡、开封两专区及郑州市的早茬麦已基本种完。由于今年种麦准备工作动手早、准备得好，因此播种质量一般良好。
    在高产地区狠抓薄弱环节，是这个省小麦播种工作的最大特点。以小麦大面积高产著名的孟县，集中优势兵力猛攻三类丰产方。这个县的缑村公社在青风岭上的三千亩小麦丰产方，因水、肥条件差，产量较低，他们就组织了五百名社员，突击整修和新建了二十条渠道，新打十三眼井，改善了灌溉条件。同时又新建了三十二个瓦瓮式的地头茅池作为肥料基地。经过这些努力，这三千多亩麦地的播种质量已超过了二类方的要求。洛阳专区，为了推广全区小麦标兵丰产方的经验，巩固提高一般地区的丰产方，在全区范围内展开了一个平原学“岳滩”（偃师县翟镇公社岳滩大队万亩小麦红旗方）、山区、丘陵学“寄料”（临汝县寄料公社的山区小麦红旗方）的学、赶、超、帮运动。灵宝县虢镇公社在学习了岳滩丰产方施足底肥的经验以后，全公社的万亩小麦丰产方施底肥比去年增加一倍多。
    在低产地区广树标兵、追赶先进，是这个省今年播种小麦的又一特点。在工作中各地都根据形成低产的不同原因，采取不同措施。中共民权县委书记王米江亲自率领一百多名干部深入到碱性最重的野鸡公社，找出了以水洗碱、以沙压碱、深翻泄碱等控制碱性上升的办法以后，即在全县推广。桐柏县鸿义河公社的社员在参观了位于山高、坡陡的兄弟大队——洛河大队在远田薄地内大建猪、羊、牲口圈，解决了运送麦田底肥的困难以后，掀起了猪、羊、牲口上山、建圈的热潮，这个社已有五百多亩远田薄地的麦播地，施上了底肥。
    为了确保小麦播种质量，各地普遍实行了边播种、边检查，边发现问题、边解决问题。南乐县许多公社还实行了犁地手验收撒粪质量，耩地手验收犁地质量、干部验收耩地质量、群众普遍检查等连环负责制，保证了小麦种足种好。
    据新华社天津12日电　河北省各地抓住雨后时机扩大种麦面积，提高播种质量，全省种麦运动已经进入高潮。到10月6日，全省冬麦播种任务已完成58％以上。
    9月下旬，河北各地普遍降雨，一般地区的墒情都比较好。中共河北省委根据这一有利条件，号召各地进一步贯彻多种多收和高产多收的方针，力争多种种好。各级党委积极响应了省委的号召，一面领导群众突击播种冬麦，一面具体帮助各人民公社和生产队千方百计扩大种麦面积。各地普遍采取劳力、畜力、工具三集中的办法，加强秋种战线的力量，加快了播种进度。据唐山、保定、石家庄三个地区统计，目前投入种麦的劳动力比9月下旬增加了一百万人。全省种麦的平均日进度已达到一百五十万亩，比9月下旬提高了87％。
    狠抓薄弱环节，保证适时地种多种好，是河北抢种小麦运动中的突出特点。中共保定市委在看到各地种麦进度不平衡的情况以后，立即组织干部深入到进度迟缓的地区，协助当地领导开展逐社、逐队全面大检查，及时解决检查出来的各种问题，使这些种麦进度较慢的地区很快掀起了种麦高潮。中共涿县县委第一书记李升和书记处的四位书记，分别率领二百多名干部，到种麦任务大的东部低洼地区帮助领导种麦工作，使这个地区的种麦日进度大大加快。为了争取多种麦，平衡地完成种麦计划，许多公社和生产队还根据等价交换的原则，抽调人力、畜力和工具帮助进度慢的生产队突击抢种，加快了这些生产队的种麦进度。
    许多地区根据今年晚秋作物较多，腾茬较晚的情况，进一步深入贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”。各地大力推广间作套种经验，变晚茬麦为早茬麦，并且采取翻地碎土、开沟施肥或施种肥的办法，来提高这些小麦的播种质量。全省小麦地在播种前普遍进行了耕翻，施肥面积达到90％以上。对已经播种的小麦，进行了检查验收。中共唐山市委在小麦播种任务基本完成后，组织了由十一万名干部、技术员和老农参加的检查团，深入田间，边查边议，发现有缺苗断垅现象就及时发动群众加以补救。许多地区还组织了临时查苗补苗专业队，加强了对幼苗的管理。
    据新华社太原12日电　山西省各人民公社掀起了以保适时、保面积、保质量为中心的冬麦播种高潮。全省冬麦播种工作已普遍进入最后的紧要阶段。到10月5日，各地参加种麦的劳动力已猛增到二百万人以上，全省计划播种的冬麦面积已完成55.9％。为了保证适时播种，晋中、晋南地区各人民公社都分别提出了在寒露、霜降以前按质按量完成播种任务的口号。这几天，冬麦播种工作正以每天五十万亩的速度向前推进。
    在冬麦下种的决定性时刻里，各地都是集中优势力量，争分夺秒地突击抢种。针对今年夏季复播面积大的特点，各地都及早安排茬口，使全省95％的回茬小麦很快落实到棉花、豆类、苜蓿等地里；各地采取打棉株的无效蕾和秋粮作物的秆叶的办法，促使其早熟，早腾茬；同时集中力量向种麦地里运送肥料。这样为适时种好回茬麦创造了有利条件。
    为了扩大今年的小麦播种面积，各地把丰产方内过宽的道路去掉，并且充分利用河滩、荒地种植。晋东南专区各人民公社为了种足种好冬麦，普遍实行了“边种、边查、边补”的办法，在种下后及时组织专人检查，发现缺苗立即补种，并积极利用土地扩大冬麦种植面积八万亩，大大提高了土地利用率。阳城县涌城人民公社社员利用河边地、沟崖地、尖草地等种麦，在最近三天内就扩大了冬麦种植面积八百六十亩。
    据各地检查，今年山西省冬麦播种质量比以往任何一年都好。深耕面积扩大，施肥足，采用优良品种，实行合理密植。晋东南专区60％的麦田面积普遍耕过三次。阳城县组织了五万六千多名社员，抓紧雨后时机两天积肥一百零五万担，都及时地运送上地，保证了种麦的需要。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐12日电　新疆维吾尔自治区全党全民抓紧霜降前的有利季节，突击抢种冬麦。最近几天，全区的日播进度已达到四十多万亩。到10月5日，全区种麦面积已接近去年播种的总数。其中巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州和尼勒克、额敏等十一个县已超额完成冬麦播种计划。
    新疆维吾尔自治区今年计划播种冬麦的面积较去年增长50％以上。为了超额完成秋播计划，根据区党委指示，自治区一级机关已抽调党委书记、部长等三十九名负责干部，和省各机关的七千六百多名干部，组织秋种劳动大军，在自治区党委第一书记王恩茂同志率领下，开赴秋播面积大、劳力少的昌吉回族自治州，参加生产，领导生产。自治州、县各级党委也都以第一书记为首，将90％左右的干部和部分城市人口组织起来，支援冬麦播种工作。和田专区、昌吉回族自治州和克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州等地，支援冬麦播种工作的已有十三万多人。
    各级党委第一书记率领广大干部深入秋播第一线以后，大大鼓舞了基层干部和社员群众的劳动积极性，加快了冬麦播种进度。自治区党委第一书记王恩茂同志带领七千多名干部深入到昌吉回族自治州各生产小队后，使这里的日播进度由前几天的二万八千多亩上升到十万亩以上。塔城专区在各级党委书记的具体领导下，到10月6日冬麦播种面积，已超过去年冬麦播种面积一倍左右。
    由于各级党委抓得紧，抓得狠，今年冬麦播种的质量也比往年好。许多公社深翻和用条播机播种的面积比去年增加了一倍，在多施底肥、精选良种、药剂拌种等方面，也比往年作得好。（附图片）
