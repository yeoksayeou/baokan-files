Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 8th: The Fourth General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was held in Vienna from September 20th to October 1st. The U.S. delegation manipulated the conference to forcibly pass a series of resolutions that violated the original purpose of the organization – to dedicate itself to "using atomic energy for the maintenance of world peace." This U.S. practice was met with stern condemnation from representatives of socialist countries and Asian-African countries.

At the beginning of the conference, the U.S. delegation used its voting machine to reject proposals put forward by representatives from Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union and other countries to expel the Chiang Kai-shek clique's representatives and allow legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the meeting, as well as proposals to allow representatives of the Hungarian People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic to participate in the IAEA. This U.S. action was met with strong protests from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland and other countries.

On the eve of the conference's closing, the U.S. delegation manipulated the conference to forcibly pass a U.S. proposal for the establishment of an IAEA "safeguards system" aimed at stealing atomic secrets from other countries. Soviet representative Professor Yemelyanov pointed out that this provision, which establishes a system of supervision and inspection, damages the sovereignty and national independence of countries receiving technical "assistance" from the IAEA. It does not stipulate any obligations for atomic powers, while allowing the United States to use it to obtain the right to freely supervise atomic science research centers in the "assisted" countries, thereby becoming the master of all atomic science research and inventions in these countries.

Under the manipulation of the United States and its North Atlantic allies, the conference also rejected a proposal by the Polish representative calling on atomic powers to reach an agreement as soon as possible on banning nuclear weapons tests, refused to grant the World Federation of Trade Unions consultative status within the IAEA, and, despite the opposition of many countries, also "elected" West Germany to the IAEA's Board of Governors.

    苏捷波代表在国际原子能机构大会上
    抗议美国阻挠中国合法代表出席会议
    新华社8日讯  维也纳消息：国际原子能机构第四届大会从9月20日至10月1日在维也纳举行。美国代表团操纵大会强行通过一连串违背这个机构原定宗旨——致力于“把原子能用于维护世界和平”的决议，美国这种作法受到社会主义国家和亚非国家代表严正的谴责。
    大会一开始，美国代表就运用表决机器否决了捷克斯洛伐克和苏联等国家代表提出的驱逐蒋介石集团代表、让中华人民共和国合法的代表出席会议的提案和让匈牙利人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的代表参加国际原子能机构的提案。美国这种行动受到苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和其他国家强烈的抗议。
    会议闭幕前夕，美国代表操纵大会强行通过了美国提出的目的在于窃取他国原子秘密的所谓建立国际原子能机构“保障制度”的提案。苏联代表叶麦利扬诺夫教授指出，这一个规定建立监督和视察的制度损害了接受国际原子能机构技术“援助”的国家的主权和民族独立。它没有为原子国家规定任何义务，而使得美国可以借助它取得对受“援”国原子科学研究中心自由地进行监督的权利，借此成为这些国家一切原子科学研究和发明的主人。
    在美国及其北大西洋盟国操纵下，大会还否决了波兰代表呼吁原子国家尽速就禁止核武器试验达成协议的提案，拒绝在国际原子能机构中给予世界工会联合会以咨询地位，同时不顾许多国家的反对，还把西德“选入”国际原子能机构的理事会。
