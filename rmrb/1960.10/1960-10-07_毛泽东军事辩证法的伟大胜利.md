    The Great Victory of Mao Zedong's Military Dialectics

    On the Question of the Whole and the Part
    Now let’s talk about the relationship between the whole and the part in guiding warfare.
    In the early stage of the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, Chiang Kai-shek's army launched a large-scale and comprehensive offensive against our liberated areas. At that time, in terms of the overall situation, we were in a temporarily inferior and passive position. However, from a local perspective, in every battlefield, except for certain temporarily evacuated areas, our army launched a series of offensive campaigns concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one, forming many local advantages and gaining the initiative. This inconsistent relationship between the whole and the part, interacting and complementing each other, after more than a year of development and change, transformed us from a position of overall inferiority to one of overall superiority, and from overall passivity to overall initiative. This was a tremendous change. This change once again proved that Comrade Mao Zedong's correct strategic guidelines, operational principles, and military dialectics, starting from the overall situation of the Chinese revolution, embodied the common and fundamental interests of every battlefield. It served as a guiding light, leading the war from local victories to overall victory, thereby maximizing the mobilization of positive factors in all aspects and fully leveraging the positive role of each part. This role then propelled the overall situation, from quantitative change to qualitative change, from local qualitative change to fundamental overall change, enabling the rapid victory of the entire revolutionary war. At the beginning of the war, Chiang Kai-shek, relying on the support of American imperialism, attempted to swallow up the liberated areas in three to five months, fully confident in controlling the overall advantage. However, contrary to his wishes, his reactionary troops were repeatedly annihilated in large numbers in every battlefield, quickly losing their overall advantage. History had long predetermined that the development of events would always run counter to the wishes of the reactionaries.
    We must consider the overall situation, we must obey the overall situation, and we must have a global perspective. This principle is understood not only by commanders at all levels but also by the vast majority of our soldiers. It is precisely because all our commanders and fighters possess strategic vision, confidence in the overall victory, a strong will to safeguard common interests, and a consciousness of considering and obeying the overall situation that we fearlessly and bravely advance, regardless of how perilous our combat environment may be, even if it requires making temporary sacrifices in our local area.
    Commanding the overall situation of a war requires not only a perspective that encompasses the whole but also the ability to control it. The commander of the fifth anti-"encirclement and suppression" campaign during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War made a tremendous mistake on this issue. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that they paid attention to neither the part nor the whole, and their style of work was reckless; he pointed out that their error stemmed from the revolutionary impatience of petty-bourgeois intellectuals and also from the local conservatism of small-scale peasant producers. This local conservatism meant a lack of a global perspective, an inability to see the whole picture, and a lack of the ability to connect partial interests with overall interests, clinging to one part and refusing to let go. This error should be remembered as a lesson forever.
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that the whole commands the part, and the part is subordinate to the whole. Only by viewing the part from the perspective of the whole can we correctly understand the role and significance of each part. In our war experience, we have encountered many such problems. From a local perspective, they are difficult to understand, but from a global perspective, they are easy to comprehend. In December 1948, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed the Pingjin Front that, before completing the entire campaign deployment, the basic principle was to encircle without attacking or isolate without encircling, waiting for the entire deployment to be completed before annihilating the enemy piecemeal. At that time, although the enemy's 35th Army in Xinbaoan had already been surrounded by us, from a local point of view, it could have been annihilated sooner. However, in order to attract the enemy in Pingjin and prevent them from resolutely fleeing by sea, our army decided to temporarily encircle without attacking. At the same time, in order to prevent Chiang Kai-shek from shipping the enemies in Pingjin south, Comrade Mao Zedong also instructed the Huaihai Front to temporarily leave the remnants of Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi's army corps under the command of Du Yuming, without making final annihilation plans for two weeks. The results showed that Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions were completely correct. We not only eliminated more than 520,000 enemy troops in Pingjin but also completely annihilated the Du Yuming Group temporarily left on the Huaihai Front. It is very clear that only by understanding the whole and obeying the whole can we manage the part well and leverage the positive roles of each front. Without a global perspective and strategic vision, without considering issues related to the overall situation, and adopting a departmentalist attitude, one would lose sight of the big picture and lose direction in complex situations.
    The most prominent issue in resolving the relationship between the whole and the part is grasping the key points, that is, grasping the critical links. For example, in the Liaoshen Campaign, capturing Jinzhou was the decisive move of the entire campaign. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed our Northeast Army that we must focus our attention on the Jinzhou operation and strive to capture the city quickly. As long as we captured Jinzhou and cut off the retreat route of the Kuomintang army in the Northeast back to Guannei, even if other goals were not achieved, our army would have the initiative and it would be a great victory. Facts proved that, due to the capture of Jinzhou, the Northeast issue was quickly resolved, and the liberation of the Northeast greatly advanced the national situation. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that in the history of war, there have been cases where a single defeat after successive victories led to the abandonment of all previous gains, and there have also been cases where a single victory after many defeats opened up a new situation. These successive victories and many defeats did not play a decisive role in the overall situation; while the "one victory" and "one defeat" mentioned here were decisive. The same is true for doing anything; if one tries to grasp everything at once and uses force evenly, grasping everything, the result is that nothing can be done well and no problems can be solved. Like leadership work and commanding battles, there is a whole and a part. If one does not carefully grasp the key points and critical issues, it is difficult to achieve outstanding results in the work. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If there are many contradictions in any process, one of them must be the main one, playing a leading and decisive role, while the others are secondary and subordinate. Therefore, in studying any process, if it is a complex process with more than two contradictions, one must make every effort to find its main contradiction. Once this main contradiction is grasped, all problems will be easily solved." He also said: "Leaders at any level should focus their attention on the problems or actions that are most important and decisive for the overall situation they are commanding, and not on other problems or actions." This is an extremely important aspect of the art of war and a key to defeating the enemy.
    The relationship between the whole and the part is very complex, and it is constantly developing and changing. Mastering and applying the laws of motion between the whole and the part depends on our always looking at the part from the perspective of the whole, always considering and obeying the whole; it depends on our being good at grasping key points and critical links in the overall situation. This is how it should be in all struggles for revolution and construction, and even more so in war.
    On the Question of Human Factors and Material Factors
    How to correctly understand the human and material factors in war and how to correctly handle the relationship between the two is another important aspect of the struggle between materialist dialectics and metaphysics. Subjectively and one-sidedly viewing the relationship between people and things, isolating the two, seeing things but not people, or seeing people but not things, is a metaphysical viewpoint. Dialectical materialists believe that in war, we must attach importance to the role of things and also attach importance to the role of people. Only by closely combining people and things can we win battles. However, these two factors cannot be regarded as equal or treated equally. People and things, the dominant aspect is people, not things; if this is reversed, we will commit the error of "weapons determinism." Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things. The comparison of strength is not only a comparison of military strength and economic strength, but also a comparison of manpower and popular support. Military strength and economic strength must be mastered by people." This is the Marxist scientific thesis on the relationship between people and things in war.
    Without the necessary material basis, war cannot be won. In terms of weapons, although they are not the decisive factor in war, they are an important factor. Marxists have always attached great importance to the important role of weapons in war. The reason why revolutionary people use spears to deal with enemies with guns, and use millet plus rifles to deal with enemies with bread plus cannons, is not because they ignore the role of weapons, but simply because they temporarily lack the conditions to equip themselves with sophisticated weapons. It can be imagined that in past revolutionary wars, if our army had mastered more sophisticated weapons, it would have been "like a tiger with wings," greatly enhancing its combat effectiveness and defeating the enemy more quickly. Under the care of Comrade Mao Zedong, our army has always attached importance to improving its weapons and equipment, and even in the most difficult situations, it has always actively improved the conditions of weapons and equipment through methods such as "making our own" or "seizing from the enemy." After the national victory, under the correct guidance of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong's policy of building our army into an excellent, modern, and revolutionary army, our army has developed from a single service into a combined arms force. The various technical branches of the army have been strengthened, a powerful air force has been established, and the navy has been developed accordingly. In the future, with the development of modern military science, striving to climb the peaks of science and technology is even more necessary to improve the combat effectiveness of our army. Emphasizing the role of people does not mean that the role of weapons is irrelevant. With the development of science and technology, the power of modern weapons has clearly increased. It would be military conservatism to close our eyes to the development of military technology and ignore the role of modern weapons. Conservatism will only lead to the backwardness of the army's technical equipment. And backwardness will lead to being beaten.
    The role of weapons in war is important, but the dominant and decisive factor is still people. This is our fundamental difference from "weapons determinism." It is the people who decide the history of the world, and it is the people who decide the outcome of war, certainly not weapons. History has always shown that revolutionary people with inferior equipment defeat fully armed reactionaries, which is the best proof. The reason why our revolutionary war was victorious was the result of mobilizing the people, arming the people, extensively organizing militias, and implementing a people's war combining the main force with the militia and combining armed masses with unarmed masses, according to Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of people's war. The reason why the imperialist reactionaries failed was by no means because they lacked sophisticated weapons to massacre the people, but because they opposed the people, were divorced from the people, and lacked the support of the people. All things in the world must be done by people. Weapons must be mastered by people, and battles must be fought by people. Weapons are dead, and people are alive. The extent to which weapons play a role depends on the people who master the weapons. The same weapons have different effects in the hands of different people. The role of weapons in the hands of a revolutionary army is completely different from that in the hands of a counter-revolutionary army. In the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, although the Kuomintang reactionary army possessed American weapons such as airplanes, tanks, and artillery, and was backed by the ferocious American imperialism armed to the teeth, it was ultimately defeated by the People's Liberation Army, which only had millet plus rifles, and even "transported" weapons into our hands. Similarly, the fact that the Korean and Chinese People's Armies defeated the imperialist aggressor army with the most modern weapons on the Korean battlefield fully proves that the decisive factor is still people, not weapons. The reason why we were able to defeat enemies with superior equipment with inferior equipment is ultimately due to the political advancement of people. If weapons are advanced but politics are backward, although they may be "imposing" for a while, they will ultimately turn from strong to weak, until complete defeat. If weapons are backward but politics are advanced, although they may be temporarily at a disadvantage, they will ultimately turn from weak to strong and achieve final victory. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the early stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan: "Although Japan has superior technical conditions, it will inevitably fail, not only because we inflict annihilation and attrition on it, but also because its military morale will inevitably waver with our blows, and the combination of weapons and soldiers will be unstable." Hasn't the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan fully proven Comrade Mao Zedong's great foresight? The same is true of Chiang Kai-shek's final defeat by us. Only when advanced weapons are in the hands of people with advanced ideas can people and things be closely combined to unleash unparalleled power. "The decisive factor is people, not things," this Marxist view of war factors applies not only to the past but also to the future.
      "Weapons determinists" attempt to use the development of modern weapons, and the destructiveness of atomic weapons, to negate the Marxist principle that "people are the decisive factor in war," but this is futile. The atom bomb is a weapon for mass slaughter. The development of this weapon has caused and will continue to cause profound changes in the military. It is very important to correctly understand it, effectively deal with it, and use it. However, no matter how much weapons improve, it is impossible to change this principle. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "The atom bomb is a paper tiger used by the American reactionaries to scare people. It looks terrible, but it is actually not terrible. Of course, the atom bomb is a weapon of mass slaughter, but it is the people who decide the outcome of war, not one or two new-style weapons." He also said: "Can the atom bomb solve the war? No. The atom bomb cannot make Japan surrender. Without the people's struggle, the atom bomb is empty." In fact, although the atom bomb has great destructive and killing power, it cannot occupy territory or resolve battles; it is still people who occupy territory and ultimately resolve battles. The outcome of future wars will not be determined by missiles or atom bombs, but will still be determined by people. The atom bomb can never destroy mankind or the world, a point that even some bourgeois military strategists admit. Revolutionary people will always find ways to subdue any new type of weapon. History will prove that it is not the atom bomb that subdues the people, but the people who subdue the atom bomb. The future of the world belongs to the people, not to the atom bomb.
    Some people regard the atom bomb as something magical, but they forget that there are things in the world that are more powerful than the atom bomb, and that is the power of the people, that is, "the vast political mobilization of the entire army and the entire people," that is, Marxism-Leninism. Our cause is a just cause, a cause of the people themselves, and therefore it is supported by the people wholeheartedly. The higher the people's political consciousness, the greater their revolutionary enthusiasm. When the people and soldiers are united as one and fight for their own cause, their power is incomparably great. When the people are truly awakened, they can plunge any powerful enemy into the vast ocean of destruction. Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries were both drowned in this ocean, and if American imperialism dares to launch a war, it will also be drowned in this ocean. What are the imperialists most afraid of? Comrade Mao Zedong said: "What the imperialists fear most is the awakening of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the awakening of the people of all countries in the world." The awakening of the people is the decisive factor that can put imperialism and colonialism to death. We are resolutely opposed to nuclear war and have consistently advocated the prohibition and destruction of atomic and hydrogen weapons. But if the imperialists dare to be inhuman and insist on waging a nuclear war, we are not afraid. The awakened people will eventually defeat all enemies.
                    × × ×
    Lenin said that the most essential thing in Marxist theory, the living soul of Marxist theory, is the concrete analysis of concrete situations. The distinct characteristic of Mao Zedong's military dialectics is to specifically analyze specific contradictions in military struggles, recognize the universality of contradictions, and focus more on analyzing the particularity of contradictions, opposing empiricism and dogmatism; recognizing "two-point theory," opposing one-sidedness; distinguishing between major and minor contradictions, the main and secondary aspects of contradictions, grasping the objective laws of mutual transformation of contradictions, and giving play to the subjective initiative of people to promote the transformation of contradictions. Military struggle is a contradictory movement, and this movement is sharp and fierce, intricate and complex, and constantly changing. If one is not good at analyzing contradictions and finding laws from within the movement, one will be dazzled and at a loss. Only by firmly grasping the key of unity and struggle of the various aspects of contradictions, analyzing the all-encompassing military phenomena and the rapidly changing military situations, can we find the essence of the problem, can we make subjective guidance conform to objective laws, and can we correctly guide and implement war. Comrade Mao Zedong's military dialectics is the crystallization of Comrade Mao Zedong's application of materialist dialectics to study and guide the Chinese revolutionary war. It is not only a guide for military struggle but also a guide for all revolutionary struggles.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's military dialectics is broad and profound. The issues discussed above are just some limited understandings and insights of my own in the process of learning. Comrade Mao Zedong's military dialectics is a philosophy of practice. It was born in the revolutionary war and has exerted infinite combat power in the revolutionary war, radiating the magnificent light of victory, like the sun and moon traversing the sky, eternally new. In the mass movement to study Mao Zedong's works that has been launched nationwide, there will inevitably be more people who arm their minds with Comrade Mao Zedong's military dialectics. When military dialectics is combined with the broad masses, especially with the national militia and the People's Liberation Army, it can generate incomparably enormous spiritual and material power. By uniting more closely around Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, we will surely achieve even greater victories in national defense construction and in the struggle to liberate Taiwan and defend peace and oppose aggression. The era belongs to the people, and the world also belongs to the people. Let us intensify our study of Marxism-Leninism, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and advance bravely.

    毛泽东军事辩证法的伟大胜利
    傅钟
     （续昨）
    关于全局与局部的问题
    现在再谈谈指导战争上的全局与局部的关系问题。
    第三次国内革命战争的初期，蒋介石军队向我各解放区发动了大规模的全面的进攻。当时就全局来说，我们处于暂时劣势和被动的地位。可是从局部来看，除了某些暂时撤退的地区以外，我军在各个战场，展开了集中优势兵力、各个歼灭敌人的一系列的战役进攻，形成了许多局部的优势，获得了主动。这种全局与局部不一致的情况，相反相成，经过一年多的发展变化，我们由全局的劣势变成了全局的优势，由全局的被动变成了全局的主动。这是一个巨大的变化。这个变化，再次证明了毛泽东同志正确的战略方针、作战原则和军事辩证法，是从中国革命的全局出发，体现了各个战场共同的根本的利益，它是引导战争由局部胜利走向全局胜利的指路明灯，因而能最大限度地调动各个方面的积极因素，充分发挥各个局部的积极作用。这种作用的发挥，又推动着全局，由量变到质变，由局部的质变到全局的根本变化，使整个革命战争迅速取得胜利。战争开初，蒋介石依靠美帝国主义的支持，企图三个月到五个月把解放区一口吞掉，他满以为能控制全局的优势。但是，事与愿违，他的反动军队，在各个战场一次接一次地被我们大量歼灭，很快地失去了全局的优势。历史的命运早就注定了，事态的发展总是同反动派的意愿背道而驰的。
    一定要照顾全局，一定要服从全局，一定要有全局观点。这个道理，对我们来说，不仅各级指挥员懂得，而且广大的战士也懂得。正是由于我们的全体指战员具有战略眼光，具有全局必胜的信心，具有维护共同利益的坚强意志，具有照顾全局和服从全局的自觉性，因而不管自己所处的战斗环境如何险恶，即使对于自己所处的局部要作出暂时的牺牲，我们都奋不顾身，勇往直前。
    指挥一个战争的全局，不仅要有通观全局的眼光，而且要有驾驭全局的能力。第二次国内革命战争中第五次反“围剿”的指挥者在这个问题上就犯过绝大的错误。毛泽东同志指出，他们对于局部和全局都不注意，是一种鲁莽灭裂的干法；指出他们的错误来源于小资产阶级知识分子的革命急躁病，同时也来源于农民小生产者的局部保守性。这种局部保守性，就是没有全局观点，没有通观全局的眼光和驾驭全局的能力，不能把部分利益和全体利益联系起来，捉住一局部的东西死也不放。这种错误，应该永远引为教训。
    毛泽东同志教导我们，全局统率局部，局部隶属全局，只有从全局看局部，才能正确地认识各个局部的作用和意义。在我们的战争生活中，遇到过许多这样的问题，如从局部看局部，那是很难想通的，如果从全局看局部，那是很好理解的。1948年12月，毛泽东同志指示平津前线，在完成整个战役部署之前，基本原则是围而不打，或隔而不围，以待整个部署完成之后，各个歼敌。当时新保安之敌三十五军虽已被我包围，从局部来看，可以早日歼灭该敌，但为了吸引平津之敌，使其不好下从海上逃走的决心，我军则决定暂时围而不打。同时，为了不使蒋介石海运平津诸敌南下，毛泽东同志又指示淮海前线，暂时留下杜聿明指挥之邱清泉、李弥诸兵团之余部，在两星期内不作最后歼灭之部署。?结果表明，毛泽东同志的指示是完全正确的。我们不但消灭了平津敌军五十二万余人，而且还全部歼灭了淮海前线暂时留下的杜聿明集团。非常明显，只有懂得全局，服从全局，才能搞好局部，才能发挥各个战线的积极作用。如果没有全局观点和战略眼光，对于有关全局性的问题不加考虑，采取本位主义的态度，那就会因小失大，在复杂的情况下迷失方向。
    解决全局与局部关系的最突出的问题是抓重点，也就是抓关键性的环节。比如在辽沈战役中，攻克锦州就是全战役的决定性的一着。毛泽东同志指示东北我军，必须把注意力放在锦州作战方面，务求迅速地攻克该城，只要攻克了锦州，切断了东北蒋军回到关内的退路，即使其他目的未能达到，我军就有了主动权，就是一个伟大的胜利。?事实证明，由于攻克了锦州，就迅速解决了东北问题，而东北的解放，又大大推进了全国战局。毛泽东同志教导我们，在战争史上，也有在连战皆捷之后吃了一个败仗以至全功尽弃的，也有在吃了许多败仗之后打了一个胜仗因而开展了新的局面的。这种连战皆捷和许多败仗，都是对全局不起决定作用的东西；而这里所说的“一个胜仗”和“一个败仗”，就都是决定性的东西了。办任何事情也是一样，如果眉毛胡子一把抓，平均使用力量，什么都抓，结果是什么事也做不好，什么问题也解决不了。做任何领导工作和指挥打仗一样，都有它的全局与局部，如果不精心地抓重点，不抓带关键性的问题，工作是难收到突出的效果的。毛泽东同志说：“任何过程如果有多数矛盾存在的话，其中必定有一种是主要的，起着领导的、决定的作用，其他则处于次要和服从的地位。因此，研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”?又说：“任何一级的首长，应当把自己注意的重心，放在那些对于他所指挥的全局说来最重要最有决定意义的问题或动作上，而不应当放在其他的问题或动作上。”?这是战争指导艺术的一个极其重要的方面，也是克敌制胜的一个关键。
    全局与局部的关系是非常复杂的，它在不断地发展变化着。掌握和运用全局与局部的运动规律，靠我们处处要从全局着眼，时时要照顾全局、服从全局；靠我们善于抓重点，善于抓住全局性的重要环节。在革命和建设的各项斗争中要这样，在战争中更要这样。
    关于人的因素和物的因素的问题
    如何正确认识战争中的人的因素与物的因素，如何正确处理两者的关系，是唯物辩证法同形而上学进行斗争的又一个重要方面。主观地片面地看待人与物的关系，把两者孤立起来，见物不见人，或见人不见物，是形而上学的观点。辩证唯物主义者认为，在战争中既要重视物的作用，又要重视人的作用，人与物紧密结合，才能打胜仗。但是，对于这两种因素也不能等量齐观，平均对待。人和物，其主导方面是人，不是物；如果颠倒过来，就会犯“唯武器论”的错误。毛泽东同志说：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。军力和经济力是要人去掌握的。”?这是马克思主义者对于战争中人与物之关系的科学论断。
    没有必要的物质基础，战争是不能取得胜利的。就武器来说，它虽不是战争的决定因素，但却是重要的因素。马克思主义者从来就十分重视武器在战争中的重要作用。革命的人民所以用长矛去对付持枪的敌人，用小米加步枪去对付有面包加大炮的敌人，并不是因为忽视武器的作用，仅仅是由于暂时没有装备精良武器的条件。可以设想，在历次革命战争中，我们的军队如果掌握了更精良的武器，就会“如虎添翼”，大大增强战斗力，就会更快地打败敌人。我军在毛泽东同志的关怀下，一向重视武器装备的改善，即使在最困难的情况下，也总是积极地通过“自己造”，或从敌人手中“夺过来”等办法，不断改善武器装备的条件。全国胜利后，在党中央和毛泽东同志的把我军建设成为优良的现代化的革命军队的正确方针指导下，我军已由单一兵种发展成为诸兵种的合成军队，陆军的各个技术兵种得到了加强，建立了一支强大的空军，并且相应地发展了海军。今后，随着现代军事科学的发展，努力攀登科学技术的高峰，更是提高我军战斗力所必需的。强调人的作用，绝不意味着武器的作用无关重要了。随着科学技术的发展，现代武器的威力显然是增大了。如果闭起眼睛不看军事技术的发展，无视现代武器的作用，这是军事上的保守主义。保守主义只会带来军队技术装备的落后。而落后是要挨打的。
    武器在战争中的作用是重要的，但主导的、决定的还是人。这是我们同“唯武器论”的根本区别。决定世界历史的是人民，决定战争胜负的也是人民，绝不是武器。历史上从来就是劣势装备的革命人民战胜全副武装的反动派，这就是最好的证明。我们的革命战争所以取得胜利，是根据毛泽东同志人民战争的思想，动员人民，武装人民，广泛组织民兵，实行主力军和民兵相结合，武装群众和非武装群众相结合的人民战争的结果。帝国主义反动派之所以失败，绝不是因为它们手中缺乏屠杀人民的精良武器，而是由于他们反对人民，脱离人民，没有人民的支持。世界上一切事情都是要人去做的。武器是要人去掌握的，仗是要人去打的。武器是死的，人是活的。武器的作用发挥得多大，决定于掌握武器的人。同样的武器掌握在不同的人的手里，就会发生不同的作用。武器掌握在革命军队手里同掌握在反革命军队手里，其作用是迥然不同的。在第三次国内革命战争中，国民党反动军队虽然掌握着飞机、坦克、大炮等美国武器，后面还站着武装到牙齿的凶恶的美帝国主义，但是最终却败给只有小米加步枪的人民解放军，并且连武器也“运输”到我们手里。同样，朝中人民军队在朝鲜战场上打败了手持最现代化武器的帝国主义侵略军的事实，也完全证明，起决定作用的仍然是人，而不是武器。我们所以能以劣势装备战胜优势装备的敌人，归根到底是由于人的政治上先进。如果武器先进，而政治落后，虽可“威风”一时，但最后终究要由强转弱，直至彻底失败。如果武器落后，而政治先进，虽可能暂时处于劣势，但终究会由弱转强，取得最后胜利。毛泽东同志在抗日战争初期就指出：“日本技术条件虽优，但它终必失败，除了我们给以歼灭和消耗的打击外，就是它的军心终必随着我们的打击而动摇，武器和兵员结合不稳。”?抗日战争的胜利不是完全证明了毛泽东同志的伟大预见吗？蒋介石的终于被我们打垮，也是同样道理。先进的武器只有掌握在先进思想的人的手里，人和物才能紧密结合，才能发挥无比的威力。“决定的因素是人不是物”，这一看待战争因素的马克思主义观点，不仅适用于过去，而且适用于未来。
      “唯武器论”者企图借口现代武器的发展，以原子武器的毁灭性来否定“人是战争的决定因素”这一马克思主义原理，是徒劳的。原子弹是一种大规模屠杀武器。这种武器的发展已经并且还将继续引起军事上的深刻变革。正确地认识它，有效地对待它使用它，是十分重要的。但是，不论武器有多大改进，决不可能改变这一条原理。毛泽东同志曾经指出：“原子弹是美国反动派用来吓人的一只纸老虎，看样子可怕，实际上并不可怕。当然，原子弹是一种大规模屠杀的武器，但是决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器。”?又说：“原子弹能不能解决战争？不能。原子弹不能使日本投降。只有原子弹而没有人民的斗争，原子弹是空的。”?实际上，原子弹虽有巨大的破坏力和杀伤力，但是总归不能占领地方，不能解决战斗；占领地方，最后解决战斗的还是人。未来战争的胜负，不决定于导弹、原子弹，仍然决定于人。原子弹决不能毁灭人类，毁灭世界，这一点，甚至连某些资产阶级的军事家也是承认的。革命的人民，总是会找到办法制服任何新式武器的。历史将证明，不是原子弹制服了人民，而是人民制服了原子弹。世界的未来是属于人民的，绝不属于原子弹。
    有些人把原子弹看得神乎其神，却忘了世界上还有比原子弹更为厉害的东西，这就是人民的力量，就是“全军全民的广大的政治动员”，就是马克思列宁主义。我们的事业是正义的事业，是人民群众自己的事业，因此得到人民群众真心实意的拥护。人民的政治觉悟越高，革命的积极性就越大。人民和士兵万众一心，为自己的事业奋斗，其威力是强大无比的。人民真正觉悟起来，就可以使任何强大的敌人陷于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海。日本帝国主义，国民党反动派，都曾被淹没在这个海洋里，美帝国主义如果敢于发动战争，也必将在这个海洋里淹死。帝国主义最害怕什么？毛泽东同志说：“帝国主义最怕的是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民觉悟，怕世界各国人民的觉悟。”?人民的觉悟，这是足以置帝国主义和殖民主义于死地的决定性的因素。我们坚决反对核战争，而且一贯主张禁止和销毁原子武器和氢武器。但是如果帝国主义竟敢灭绝人性，硬要进行核战争，我们也不怕。觉悟了的人民，终将打败一切敌人。

    列宁说过，马克思主义的最本质的东西，马克思主义的活的灵魂：具体地分析具体的情况。毛泽东军事辩证法的鲜明特色就是在军事斗争中，具体地分析具体的矛盾，认识矛盾的普遍性，又更着眼于分析矛盾的特殊性，反对经验主义和教条主义；承认“两点论”，反对片面性；区别主要矛盾和次要矛盾、矛盾的主要方面和次要方面，掌握矛盾的相互转化的客观规律，又发挥人的主观能动作用以促进矛盾的转化。军事斗争是一种矛盾运动，而且这种运动是尖锐激烈的，是错综复杂的，是千变万化的。如果不善于分析矛盾，不善于从运动的内部去寻找规律，就会眼花缭乱，莫知所措。只有紧紧掌握住矛盾诸方面的同一和斗争这把钥匙，去分析包罗万象的军事现象和瞬息万变的军事情况，才能找到问题的本质，才能使主观指导符合于客观规律，才能够正确地指导战争和实行战争。毛泽东同志的军事辩证法，乃是毛泽东同志运用唯物辩证法来研究和指导中国革命战争的结晶，它不仅是军事斗争的指南，而且是一切革命斗争的指南。
    毛泽东同志的军事辩证法是博大精深的。以上所谈的几个问题，只是自己在学习过程中的一点有限的理解和心得。毛泽东同志的军事辩证法是实践的哲学，它在革命战争中产生，又在革命战争中发挥出无穷的战斗威力，放射着胜利的万丈光芒，如同日月经天，万古长新。今后，在全国范围开展起来的学习毛泽东著作的群众运动中，必然会有更多的人用毛泽东同志的军事辩证法把思想武装起来。军事辩证法和广大群众相结合，特别是和全国民兵和人民解放军相结合，便可以产生无比巨大的精神力量和物质力量。我们更加紧密地团结在中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东同志的周围，必将在国防建设上、在解放台湾与保卫和平、反对侵略的斗争中取得更加伟大的胜利。时代是人民的，世界也是人民的，让我们加紧学习马克思列宁主义，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，奋勇前进。
