    "Serving People" is a Glorious Job
    Wang Honghua
    Some people have a vague understanding of the work of salespeople, thinking that salespeople do the work of "serving people," that it is "unpromising," and "despised by others," so they are unwilling to do this work. This kind of thinking is actually a reflection of the influence of the ideology of the exploiting classes. On this issue, we must first clarify who we are serving today. In the old society, capitalists did everything possible to exploit the working people in order to get rich. They regarded the hired salespeople as their slaves, and in order to sell a little more goods (to earn more money), they made the salespeople grovel before the customers. Therefore, in the eyes of those self-proclaimed "noble" capitalists and exploiting classes, serving people was "unpromising" and "despicable."
    But today, in our socialist country, the working people have become the masters of the country. The relationship between people is a comrade-like, truly equal relationship. Everyone participates in labor, labor has become the most glorious cause, and laborers are the most respected people. If we say that our work today is the work of "serving people," it is not impossible, but the meaning of the concept of "serving people" is essentially different from the meaning of "serving people" in the old society. In socialist society, everyone serves everyone, and everyone is served by everyone. No one is not served, and no one does not serve others. Therefore, our work of "serving people" today is not only not "despicable," but on the contrary, is a noble and glorious cause.

    “侍候人”的工作是光荣的
    王洪华
    有一些人，对营业员的工作认识模糊，认为营业员做的是“侍候人”的工作，是“没出息”，“被别人看不起的”，因而不愿做这一工作。这种思想，实际上是剥削阶级思想影响的反映。在这个问题上，首先应该明确我们今天侍候的是什么人。在旧社会，资本家为了发财致富，千方百计地剥削劳动人民，他们把雇佣的营业员看成是自己的奴隶，为了多卖一点货（多赚一点钱），让营业员在顾客面前低三下四。因此，在那些自命为“高贵”的资本家、剥削阶级的眼目中，侍候人的工作是“没出息”的、“下贱”的。
    但是在今天，在我们社会主义国家里，劳动人民成了国家的主人，人与人之间是同志式的真正平等的关系，人人都参加劳动，劳动成为最光荣的事业，劳动者是最受尊敬的人。如果把我们今天的工作说成是“侍候人”的工作，也不是不可以，不过“侍候人”这一概念的涵义，已经和旧社会的“侍候人”的涵义有本质的不同了。在社会主义社会里，是人人侍候人，人人被人侍候，没有一个人不被人侍候的，也没有一个人不侍候人的。所以我们今天的“侍候人”的工作，不但不是“下贱的”，相反，是崇高的光荣的事业。
