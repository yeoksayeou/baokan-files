Xinhua News Agency, 6th October. Colonel Lak, the Military Attaché of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic to China, and his wife, hosted a reception this evening to celebrate the 16th anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak People's Army.

General Tan Zheng, Vice Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, was invited to attend the reception. On behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, he extended the warmest congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the fraternal Czechoslovak People's Army.

General Tan Zheng said that the Czechoslovak People's Army grew and strengthened in the anti-fascist war. It has experienced an arduous and glorious combat path. It has made brilliant contributions to the cause of liberation of the Czechoslovak people. He said that under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the heroic Czechoslovak People's Army has become a modern people's armed force, vigilantly defending the socialist construction of its own country, and, together with the armies of socialist countries, defending European and world peace side by side.

General Tan Zheng said that the ties of the great socialist and communist cause closely link the people of China and Czechoslovakia and the two fraternal armies. The common cause and the consistent goals make us advance side by side at all times. In the struggle against imperialist aggression, safeguarding world peace, and defending the security of our respective countries, we always support each other and cooperate closely. This brotherly fighting friendship is eternal and cannot be destroyed by any force. With the vigorous development of our socialist and communist cause, our brotherly friendship will surely continue to develop and consolidate.

Colonel Lak said at the reception that in the fifteen years since liberation, our country has undergone great changes, and the achievements in our country's economic construction are encouraging us to continue to move forward.

Colonel Lak said that we have always adhered to the principle of peaceful coexistence with countries with different social systems. We support with deep sympathy the just struggle of the people of all colonial countries for political and economic independence and autonomy. However, the imperialist aggressor forces are still clamoring for war and strangling the liberation movements of the colonial people. They directly support the revival of West German militarism, arming West Germany with rockets and nuclear weapons, threatening the security of our western border. We must maintain constant vigilance against US imperialism and West German militarism. He said that we are not afraid of the war cries of imperialism and West German militarism. Because the strength of the entire socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is defending our inviolable borders.

Colonel Lak finally said that the friendship between the people and armies of Czechoslovakia and China is deeply rooted. He congratulated the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army on their greater achievements in the cause of building and defending the motherland.

Josef Šedivý, Ambassador of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic to China, attended the reception.

Also invited to attend the reception were Senior General Xiao Hua, Senior General Gan Siqi, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Liu Zhong, Vice Admiral Dun Xingyun, Lieutenant General Xu Shenji of the Air Force, Major General Tan Shanhe, Major General Zhang Rugang, Major General Wang Fengwu of the Air Force, Rear Admiral Cai Changfeng, Major General Liao Dingxiang, Major General Dong Yongqing, and Major General Su Huanqing, as well as senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and representatives of officers from troops stationed in Beijing.

Also invited to attend the reception were Luo Guibo, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, Xia Yan, President of the Sino-Czechoslovak Friendship Association, and Li Liankui, representative of the Sino-Czechoslovak Friendship People's Commune. Diplomatic envoys and military attachés of various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.

    庆祝捷建军十六周年
    新华社6日讯　捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国驻我国大使馆武官拉克上校及夫人，今晚举行招待会庆祝捷克斯洛伐克人民军建军十六周年。
    中华人民共和国国防部副部长谭政大将应邀出席了招待会。他代表中国人民解放军全体指战员，向兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民军全体官兵，致以最热烈的祝贺。
    谭政大将说，捷克斯洛伐克人民军，是在反法西斯战争中成长壮大起来的。它经历了艰苦而光荣的战斗道路。它对捷克斯洛伐克人民的解放事业，作出了光辉的贡献。他说，英勇的捷克斯洛伐克人民军，在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，已经成为一支现代化的人民武装力量，警惕地保卫着自己祖国的社会主义建设，并且同社会主义各国军队一起，并肩地捍卫着欧洲和世界和平。
    谭政大将说，伟大的社会主义和共产主义事业的纽带，把中、捷两国人民和两支兄弟军队紧密地连系在一起。共同的事业和一致的目标，使我们始终并肩前进。在反对帝国主义侵略，捍卫世界和平，保卫各自祖国的安全的斗争中，我们始终相互支持，亲密合作。这种兄弟般的战斗友谊是永恒的，是任何力量破坏不了的。随着我们社会主义、共产主义事业的蓬勃发展，我们之间的兄弟友谊，定将继续向前发展和巩固。
    拉克上校在招待会上讲话说，解放后的十五年来，我们祖国有了伟大的变化，我国经济建设上的成就在激励着我们继续前进。
    拉克上校说，我们始终坚持着与不同社会制度的国家实行和平共处的原则。我们怀着深切同情支持各殖民地国家人民为争取政治、经济的独立自主所进行的正义斗争。但是，帝国主义侵略势力仍然在叫嚣战争，扼杀殖民地人民的解放运动。他们直接支持西德军国主义的复活，用火箭和核武器武装西德，使我国的西部边界的安全受到威胁。我们对于美帝国主义和西德军国主义必须保持经常的警惕。他说，我们不怕帝国主义和西德军国主义的战争叫嚣。因为以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的力量，都在捍卫着我国不可侵犯的边界。
    拉克上校最后说，捷中两国人民和军队之间的友谊是根深蒂固的。他祝贺中国人民和中国人民解放军在建设祖国和保卫祖国的事业中取得更大的成就。
