    Good Apprentice Ding Anna
    Ding Anna (left), an apprentice in the crane workshop of the Beijing Crane Factory, has been diligently studying her profession since she entered the factory in 1958. She quickly mastered the basic techniques of assembling truck cranes. With the help of her master, she actively proposed innovation suggestions, which mechanized the originally manual operation. Here, her master, Yang Jiatai, is looking at her with satisfaction as she uses a chamfering machine to replace the manual processing of the truck crane cross joints.

    好徒工丁安娜
    北京起重机器厂汽吊车间徒工丁安娜（左），从1958年入厂以来，一贯刻苦钻研业务，很快掌握了组装汽车吊的基本技术，并在师傅帮助下，积极提革新建议，使原来手工操作的工序实现了机械化。这是师傅杨家泰满意地看着她用倒角机代替手工加工出来的汽车吊十字接头。
