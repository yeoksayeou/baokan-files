Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 25th: Marshal He Long, head of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council of China, and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a speech at the welcome banquet held by the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea tonight. The full text is as follows: Respected Premier Kim Il-sung, dear comrades, friends:

　　Today marks the tenth anniversary of the "October 25th" that represents the common victory of the people of China and Korea. On this day, our two peoples are enthusiastically carrying out celebrations. I and General Luo Ruiqing feel very honored to be able to lead the Military Friendship Delegation of the People's Republic of China to visit our close brotherly country, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and to participate in such a grand banquet. Please allow me to express my highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to the respected Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean comrades and friends present here.

　　Since we arrived in your heroic country, we have been surrounded by an atmosphere of warmth and friendship. This heartfelt affection has deeply moved us and made us once again deeply realize the friendship and love of the Korean people and army for the Chinese people and army. The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people has a long history. As early as thousands of years ago, our two peoples had close contacts. After our two peoples successively achieved liberation and became masters of their own countries, under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, we formed a close relationship like brothers and sisters, like hands and feet; in socialist construction, our two countries support and learn from each other in all aspects; in the long-term struggle against imperialism, especially in the war against American imperialist aggression, our two countries have formed close comrades-in-arms who share life and death and share weal and woe. Therefore, it can be said that our friendship is a friendship forged with blood, this friendship is evergreen, and this friendship will always shine as brightly as the sun and endure forever.

　　Dear comrades, as we commemorate "October 25th," this unforgettable day in the history of China-Korea friendship, we cannot help but recall this day ten years ago. On this day in 1950, the flames of aggression ignited by American imperialism in Korea were rapidly spreading towards our country's northeastern border. The American warmongering group attempted to annex the entire Korean Peninsula and attack China along the old path of Japanese militarism, seriously threatening world peace. In order to protect the country and defend peace, the Chinese people resolutely organized the Chinese People's Volunteers to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and went abroad to fight. After nearly three years of fighting side by side with the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army, we finally defeated the American aggressors armed to the teeth and forced the enemy to sign the armistice agreement. This historically significant great victory of the Korean and Chinese peoples not only defended the security of our respective countries but also made a glorious contribution to maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.

　　Since the armistice, under the strong leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people have overcome the unimaginable difficulties caused by the American imperialist armed aggression to the construction of the Korean people, and have closely relied on the masses, brought into play the endless creative power and high political and labor enthusiasm of the working people, and rapidly healed the wounds of war, so that the socialist economic foundation has been firmly established. In 1959, the Korean people completed the industrial gross output value plan of the first five-year plan two and a half years ahead of schedule. This year, industrial production will increase to 6.4 times that of 1949 before the war and 7.7 times that of 1944 before liberation. At the same time, agricultural collectivization was realized, and the socialist transformation of private commerce was completed. North Korea has been built into a socialist industrial and agricultural country. Now, the Korean people are continuing to prepare to implement the large-scale seven-year plan for the development of the people's economy from 1961 to 1967 with the heroic pace of leaping on the Chollima. A more splendid and glorious, more inspiring construction picture is about to be displayed.

　　Our close comrades-in-arms, the Korean People's Army, with the vigorous development of the socialist construction cause of their motherland, have also been continuously improved in modernization construction, and have focused on improving the revolutionary quality of the people's army, and rapidly strengthened their combat power, so that it has become a strong force to defend its motherland and defend the eastern outpost of the socialist camp. The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army have always been jubilant and encouraged by the brilliant achievements made by the fraternal Korean people and the Korean People's Army.

　　Dear comrades! Our two countries, China and Korea, are both peace-loving countries, and we have always pursued a peaceful foreign policy. Our country has always advocated living in harmony with all peace-loving countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and has signed treaties of friendship and non-aggression or treaties of peace and friendship with many countries that are willing to be friendly with us. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in order to peacefully reunify its motherland, has more than once suggested reducing the armed forces of North and South Korea, and has put forward a series of positive and reasonable proposals for realizing North-South consultation and North-South economic and cultural exchanges and for thoroughly resolving the Korean issue, and has unilaterally and voluntarily taken many major measures. This year, on "August 15th," Premier Kim Il-sung once again proposed the new suggestion of implementing a North-South Korean federal system as a transitional measure for the peaceful reunification of Korea. This suggestion not only conforms to the common desire of all Korean people, but also conforms to the interests of peace in the Far East and the world. The government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people warmly support this new suggestion. In order to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea and further ease the situation in the Far East, the Chinese People's Volunteers had already completely withdrawn from Korea as early as two years ago today. The peaceful sincerity of the governments and peoples of China and Korea and the major efforts made to peacefully resolve the Korean issue have won the warm welcome and universal support of peace-loving people all over the world.

　　On the contrary, American imperialism stubbornly refuses to resolve various international disputes through negotiation; it still occupies our country's territory of Taiwan, it refuses to sign a peace pact of non-aggression along the Asian and Pacific coasts, turning this region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone; it completely disregards the wishes of the Korean people and all peace-loving peoples, and consistently adheres to its policy of aggression against Korea. For several years, the American aggressors have been wantonly violating the Korean Armistice Agreement and undermining the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. They have been continuously transporting new weapons into South Korea, increasing the American troops stationed in South Korea, and further strengthening war preparations, attempting to once again use South Korea as a base for launching aggressive war. All these war provocation acts of the American aggressors not only hinder the peaceful reunification of Korea, but also seriously threaten the security of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and peace in the Far East and the world.

　　Comrades, whenever we think of the fact that southern Korea is still occupied by American aggressor troops, we cannot suppress our anger at American imperialism for creating the disaster of the Korean nation. As everyone knows, because American imperialism forcibly occupies South Korea and implements a cruel colonial enslavement policy and war policy there, today's South Korea has become a dark hell on earth. The South Korean people are groaning in hunger, and even their most basic rights have been deprived, and everyone is in danger. The South Korean people are increasingly aware that the root cause of their disasters is the American imperialist occupation of South Korea. Therefore, the South Korean people are also waging a heroic struggle against American imperialism and its agents, and have achieved the initial victory of overthrowing the traitorous Syngman Rhee. At present, the flames of this just struggle are continuing to burn. On this occasion, we once again express our deep sympathy to the South Korean people and extend our highest respect and greatest support to them.

　　Comrades! American imperialism will not abandon its policy of being hostile to the people of the world, and it is stepping up its aggression and expansion activities in various parts of the world. While American imperialism is carrying out aggression and provocation against socialist countries, it is also extremely insidiously launching attacks on the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and on the progressive cause of the people of all countries. Recently, American imperialism is attempting to coerce Latin American countries to impose an economic blockade on Cuba, and even carry out military intervention, through the Organization of American States. American imperialism is further intruding into the Congo under the banner of the United Nations and is stepping up the conspiracy to jointly administer the Congo. American imperialism is also attempting to use the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to interfere in the Laotian coup. At the 15th United Nations General Assembly, the hideous and warmongering face of American imperialism insisting on expanding armaments and preparing for war and obstructing disarmament was once again exposed to the people of the world. Not only that, but American imperialism is also doing its best to support a small group of reactionaries who are most disgusted and hated by the people of all countries, to be its accomplices in oppressing and enslaving the people of these countries. Now the people of the world have seen very clearly that American imperialism is the pillar of all the most reactionary and most decadent forces, and is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world who love peace and uphold justice.

　　However, the current international situation is still very favorable to our socialist construction and the cause of defending world peace. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong and is developing vigorously at a rapid pace. The national democratic revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are impacting the colonial rule of imperialism like surging waves. Oppressed countries have gained independence one after another. The storm of the people's revolutionary struggle in the capitalist world is rising. The strength of the world peace movement is expanding day by day. We firmly believe that as long as the people of socialist countries continue to strengthen unity, as long as the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all peace-loving and democratic forces in the world continue to strengthen unity, raise vigilance, and persist in struggle, imperialism will surely be defeated, and the just cause of the people of all countries will surely be victorious.

　　Comrades, friends: The peoples of China and Korea are as interdependent as lips and teeth, and as closely connected as flesh and blood. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army deeply sympathize with and firmly support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. We, together with the Korean people and the people of the world, resolutely demand that the American aggressor troops completely withdraw from South Korea. We firmly believe that the just struggle of the Korean people, with the support of peace-loving countries and peoples all over the world, will surely be victorious. All the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism to occupy South Korea and obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea will inevitably be completely defeated. The reunification of the beautiful mountains and rivers of Korea and the reunion of all compatriots will surely be realized.

　　Finally, please allow me to propose:

　　For the prosperity and strength of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
　　For the eternal fraternal friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Korea,
　　For the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
　　For world peace,
　　For the health of the leading comrades of the Korean Workers' Party and government headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung,
　　Cheers!

    贺龙元帅在朝鲜内阁欢迎宴会上说
    中朝人民友谊光芒四射与世长存
    新华社平壤25日电　中国访朝军事友好代表团团长、中国国防委员会副主席、国务院副总理贺龙元帅今天晚上在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁举行的欢迎宴会上的讲话，全文如下：敬爱的金日成首相同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    今天，是标志着中、朝两国人民共同胜利的“十·二五”十周年纪念日，在这个日子里，我们两国人民都正在热烈地进行着庆祝活动。我和罗瑞卿大将能够率领中华人民共和国军事友好代表团前来访问我们亲密的兄弟之邦——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并且参加这样盛大的宴会，感到十分荣幸。请允许我向敬爱的金日成首相同志和在座的朝鲜同志们和朋友们表示崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。
    自从我们来到你们英雄的国家之后，就被热情和友好的气氛所包围。这种发自内心的亲切感情，深深地感动了我们，使我们又一次深刻地体会到，朝鲜人民和军队对中国人民和军队的友谊和热爱。中朝人民的友谊，是有着悠久的历史的。远在几千年以前，我们两国人民就有了亲密的来往。当我们两国人民相继获得解放、成了自己国家的主人以后，在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，更结成了如兄如弟、如手如足的亲人关系；在社会主义建设上，我们两国在各方面互相支援，互相学习；在反对帝国主义的长期斗争中，特别是在反对美帝国主义侵略的战争中，我们两国结成了同生死、共患难的亲密战友。因此，可以说：我们的友谊是以鲜血凝成的友谊，这种友谊是万古长青的，这种友谊将永远和太阳一样光芒四射，与世长存。
    亲爱的同志们，在我们纪念“十·二五”这个中朝友谊史上永远难忘的日子的时候，我们不能不回忆起十年前的今天。1950年的今天，美帝国主义在朝鲜点燃的侵略战火，正在迅速向我国东北边境延烧，美国好战集团企图吞并全部朝鲜，沿着日本军国主义的老路进攻中国，严重地威胁着世界和平。中国人民为了保家卫国、拯救和平，毅然地把自己的优秀儿女，组成志愿军抗美援朝，出国作战；经过同英雄的朝鲜人民和人民军将近三年的携手并肩，英勇奋战，终于打败了武装到牙齿的美国侵略者，逼使敌人在停战协定上签了字。朝中人民这一具有历史意义的伟大胜利，不但捍卫了我们各自祖国的安全，并且对维护远东和世界的和平，作出了辉煌的贡献。
    停战以后，朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的坚强领导下，克服了美帝国主义的武装进攻给予朝鲜人民的建设所造成的、难以想像的困难，并且紧紧地依靠了群众，发挥了劳动人民的无穷无尽的创造力量和高度的政治、劳动热情，迅速地医治了战争的创伤，使社会主义的经济基础已经巩固地建立起来。1959年，朝鲜人民提前两年半完成了第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划。今年工业生产，将增长到战前1949年的六点四倍，解放前1944年的七点七倍。同时，实现了农业合作化，完成了私营商业的社会主义改造。朝鲜北部已经建成为社会主义工业农业国。现在，朝鲜人民正继续以跨上千里马的豪迈步伐，正在准备执行规模宏大的1961年至1967年人民经济发展七年计划。一幅更加灿烂光辉、更为振奋人心的建设图景，就要展示出来。
    我们亲密的战友朝鲜人民军，随着自己祖国社会主义建设事业的蓬勃发展，在现代化的建设上也不断地得到提高，并且着重地提高了人民军队的革命素质，迅速地加强了战斗威力，使它已经成为保卫自己祖国和保卫社会主义阵营东方前哨的一支坚强力量。中国人民和人民解放军，一向为兄弟的朝鲜人民和人民军所取得的光辉成就，感到欢欣鼓舞。
    亲爱的同志们！我们中朝两国都是热爱和平的国家，我们一贯奉行着和平外交政策。我国一贯主张在和平共处五项原则的基础上同一切爱好和平的国家和睦相处，并且已经同许多愿意同我们友好的国家签订了友好和互不侵犯条约，或者和平友好条约。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，为了和平统一自己的祖国，不止一次地建议裁减南北朝鲜的武装力量，提出实现南北部协商和南北部经济、文化交流以及有关彻底解决朝鲜问题的一系列积极的合理的建议，并且单方面主动地采取了许多重大措施。今年“八·一五”金日成首相又再一次提出，实行南北朝鲜的联邦制作为和平统一朝鲜的过渡措施的新建议。这个建议，不仅符合全体朝鲜人民的共同愿望，而且符合远东和世界和平的利益。中华人民共和国政府和中国人民热烈支持这个新建议。为了促进朝鲜的和平统一和进一步缓和远东局势，中国人民志愿军早在两年前的今天就已经全部撤出了朝鲜。朝中两国政府和人民的和平诚意以及为和平解决朝鲜问题所做的重大努力，赢得了全世界爱好和平的人民的热烈欢迎和普遍支持。
    与此相反，美帝国主义却横蛮地不愿用谈判方式来解决国际之间的各种争端；它至今还霸占着我国的领土台湾，它拒绝在亚洲和太平洋沿岸签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约，使这个地区成为无核武器的地区；它根本不顾朝鲜人民和一切爱好和平的人民的愿望，始终坚持侵略朝鲜的政策。几年来，美国侵略者一直在放肆地破坏朝鲜停战协定，破坏中立国监察委员会的工作。他们把新式武器不断运进南朝鲜，增强驻在南朝鲜的美军，进一步加强战争准备，企图再一次把南朝鲜作为发动侵略战争的基地。美国侵略者的这一切战争挑衅行为，不仅阻挠了朝鲜的和平统一，而且严重地威胁着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的安全以及远东和世界和平。
    同志们，当我们一想起朝鲜南部至今还被美国侵略军占领着的时候，我们就无法抑制对于制造朝鲜民族灾难的美帝国主义的愤怒。大家知道，由于美帝国主义强占南朝鲜，并且在那里推行残酷的殖民奴役政策和战争政策，今天的南朝鲜已经成了暗无天日的人间地狱。南朝鲜人民在饥饿中呻吟，甚至被夺去了最起码的权利而人人自危。南朝鲜人民，他们越来越清楚地认识到，他们灾难的根源是由于美帝国主义对于南朝鲜的占领。因此，南朝鲜人民也正在同美帝国主义及其代理人进行着英勇的斗争，并且已经取得打倒李承晚卖国贼的初步胜利。目前，这一正义斗争的火焰，正在继续燃烧。借此机会，我们再次向南朝鲜人民表示深切的同情，并且向他们致以崇高的敬意和最大的声援。
    同志们！美帝国主义是不会放弃它与全世界人民为敌的政策的，它正在加紧对于世界各地的侵略和扩张活动。当美帝国主义向社会主义国家进行侵略和挑衅的同时，又在极其阴险地向亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动和各国人民的进步事业实行进攻。最近，美帝国主义正在通过美洲国家组织，企图胁迫拉丁美洲国家对古巴实行经济封锁，甚至进行军事干涉。美帝国主义正打着联合国的旗帜，进一步侵入刚果，并且加紧策划共管刚果的阴谋。美帝国主义还企图利用东南亚条约组织来干涉老挝政变。在十五届联合国大会上，美帝国主义坚持扩军备战，阻挠裁军的狰狞好战面目，又再一次地暴露在世界人民面前。不仅如此，美帝国主义还极力扶植各国人民最厌恶和最痛恨的一小撮反动派，来做它压迫和奴役这些国家人民的帮凶。现在世界人民已经看得很清楚，美帝国主义是一切最反动、最腐朽势力的支柱，是世界爱好和平、坚持正义的人民的最凶恶的敌人。
    但是，目前的国际形势，对于我们的社会主义建设和保卫世界和平的事业还是非常有利的。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量空前强大，并且正在一日千里地蓬勃发展。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动，像汹涌的波涛一样冲击着帝国主义的殖民统治。被压迫的国家接二连三地获得了独立。资本主义世界人民革命斗争的风暴正在兴起。全世界和平运动力量正在日益扩大。我们坚信，只要社会主义各国人民继续加强团结，只要亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民和全世界一切和平、民主力量继续加强团结，提高警惕、坚持斗争，帝国主义就一定要失败，各国人民的正义事业是一定要胜利的。
    同志们，朋友们：中朝两国人民是唇齿相依、血肉相连的。中国人民和中国人民解放军，深切同情和坚决支持朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一的斗争。我们同朝鲜人民和全世界人民一起，坚决要求美国侵略军全部撤出南朝鲜。我们坚信，朝鲜人民的正义斗争，在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，一定能够胜利。美帝国主义霸占南朝鲜、阻挠朝鲜和平统一的一切侵略阴谋必将遭到彻底的失败。朝鲜锦绣山河的统一和全体同胞的团聚是一定要实现的。
    最后，请允许我提议：
    为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的繁荣富强，
    为中朝两国人民和军队之间永恒的兄弟友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，
    为世界和平，
    为以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和政府的领导同志的健康，
    干杯！
