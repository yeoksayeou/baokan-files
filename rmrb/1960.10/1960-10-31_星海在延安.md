    Xinghai in Yan'an
    Li Ling

    Xinghai's life in Yan'an was the most meaningful and creatively active period of his short life.

    He had long yearned for this anti-Japanese base area, for the Party, and for Chairman Mao. It was not until the end of 1938 that he truly achieved this wish and arrived in Yan'an.

    In this free environment, he learned a great deal of revolutionary theory and was able to freely display his talents. He often compared the then-Great Rear Area (the Kuomintang-controlled area) with the revolutionary holy land, saying: "In the Great Rear Area, many musicians (referring to those in the upper echelons – author's note) were engaged in infighting, while here it is so warm, lively, caring, and supportive. You can do as much as you are capable of." Indeed, the oppression, exclusion, and attacks Xinghai suffered from his peers in the upper echelons in the Kuomintang-controlled area were embarrassing to him. He mentioned these unpleasant things in his later creative notes.

    As soon as he arrived in Yan'an, he was assigned to work in the Music Department of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts. He saw that the young students were lacking in many things (musical knowledge), and he couldn't wait to settle down before giving them classes. He taught conducting, lectured on composition, rehearsed choirs, and talked about his creative experiences. He was so enthusiastic, wanting to cram everything into the minds of these revolutionary youths at once.

    Soon, he accepted the task of composing an opera. The academy gave him a cave dwelling as a studio and provided him with a few kilograms of firewood for heating every day. He knew that many cadres did not receive such preferential treatment. He said, "I will repay the Party's concern with my heart and soul." In this cave dwelling, he completed his first opera, "March of the Military and the People," and many other works.

    At that time, the issue of national style in music was just beginning to be discussed in Yan'an. This opera had its successes, but also its shortcomings; although he had already paid attention to relating the opera's melodies to folk music, he had not yet achieved an organic integration. He later called this new attempt a new "combination of Chinese and Western elements." The emergence of "March of the Military and the People" sparked a discussion. During this discussion, Xinghai gained a further understanding of the requirements for national forms.

    In the spring of 1939, Yan'an launched a self-reliance production movement, which was a concrete implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary thought on consolidating the base area. Xinghai quickly threw himself into this movement, and he first composed the famous "Production Cantata." This cantata can be said to be a new starting point for the changes in Xinghai's musical style. He used a new musical language, lively, bright, passionate, and with strong national characteristics, to praise this movement. Before this cantata was formally performed, songs such as "Coming in February" and "Sour Dates" resounded on every hilltop
   (at that time, land was mainly reclaimed on the mountains). Here a group, there a pile, working while singing, rising and falling, the singing like a tide stirred the hearts of every worker.

    "Production Cantata" was loved by the people of Yan'an, and he was very happy. He saw that his first attempt at national form had achieved initial results, and he resolutely marched in this direction.

    At that time, the Anti-Enemy Drama Troupe No. 3 was in Yan'an for rest and reorganization, and he quickly began to collaborate with Comrade Guang Weiran on "Yellow River Cantata."

    "Yellow River Cantata" was rushed out in five or six days. This nationally-shaking work expressed the Chinese people's revolutionary will under the leadership of the proletariat and the Party, and its brilliance has shone to this day and will continue to do so in the distant future.

    Xinghai was a particularly diligent revolutionary. After completing this work, he was pondering a new idea. He felt that under the direct leadership of the Party, he should further write more meaningful things for the revolution, but how to make further explorations and achievements based on the Party's proposed goals of popularization and nationalization of art still required continuous effort. He hoped to put his intentions into practice in his next work, and before starting, he needed nourishment from various aspects, such as studying folk music. This next work was the "September 18th Cantata."

    In creating the "September 18th Cantata," he had two intentions. One was that he believed that optimistic melodies should be used to commemorate this painful anniversary. He said, "The songs about 'September 18th' that were popular in the Northeast in the past mostly had overly sentimental tones, and could not play a great role in inspiring the masses."

    The second was that he wanted to try to create a more unified national style in this new work. He talked to us about this intention before the design, and while writing, he read some paragraphs to us to see if this work, whether in melody, rhythm, the application of musical instruments (especially percussion instruments), harmony, counterpoint exploration, or the arrangement of modulation... all had the nature of a bold attempt. He wanted to make the songs in this work more varied and more unified than "Yellow River Cantata."

    He felt that he had achieved these two points; even when he recalled this work in Moscow later, he believed that this exploration was very meaningful. He also mentioned in his notes that "perhaps it is more unified than "Yellow River Cantata"", "In this cantata, the author cautiously explored the melody, rhythm and harmony, dared not say that there was any contribution, but only fulfilled a small responsibility for the war of resistance."

    He also wrote excellent songs such as "Sacrifice League Cantata," "Liang Hongyu," "Counterattack," and "Down with Wang Jingwei" in Yan'an. He never forgot his First Symphony which he was in the process of completing ("National Liberation Symphony"). He talked to us about his plan several times and showed us his drafts. He cherished this work very much and carried it with him wherever he went. However, in Yan'an, he only had time to write it into piano score. In his opinion, this symphony was his most beloved and most capable of encompassing his thoughts and will at that time. After he finished writing it (completed in the Soviet Union), he specially dedicated it to Chairman Mao. He wrote in his notes: "I earnestly request that this work be contributed to the great Comrade Mao Zedong, he is the true national savior I admire the most, his path is correct, and only in this way can China be saved, and the crisis of the entire nation be saved."

    星海在延安
    李凌
    星海在延安的生活，是他短短的一生中最有意义、创作最活跃的几年。
    他很早就向往这个抗日根据地，向往党，向往毛主席。直至1938年底，他才真正达到这个愿望，来到了延安。
    在这个自由的天地里，他学到许多革命的理论，也从心所欲地施展他的才能。他常常把当时的大后方（国民党统治区）和革命的圣地相比较，他说：“在大后方，许多音乐家（指上层的——作者）都是勾心斗角，而这里是如此温暖、活跃，互相关切，互相支持，你有多少能力，就能够做多少事情。”的确，星海在国民党统治区所遭到的当时上层的同行的倾轧、排挤、打击是使他难堪的。他在后来的创作札记中还谈到这些不愉快的事情。
    他一到延安，就被分配到鲁迅艺术学院音乐系去工作。他看到年青的同学们所缺少的东西（音乐知识）不少，等不及安定下来就给大家上课。他上指挥课，讲作曲，排练合唱，谈他的创作经验。他是那样热心，想一下把什么东西都往这群革命青年的肚子里塞。
    很快，他就接受了创作歌剧的任务。学院给了他一个窑洞作为创作室，并且每天给他几斤取暖的木炭。他知道，许多干部都没有得到这样的优待。他说：“我将用我的心血来报答党的关心。”在这个窑洞里，他完成了他第一个歌剧《军民进行曲》和其他许多作品。
    当时延安正开始谈论音乐的民族风格问题。这阕歌剧有它成功的地方，也还有它的不足；他虽然已经注意到使歌剧的音调和民间音乐发生关系，但还没有做到有机的结合。他后来把这个新的尝试称之为新的“中西合璧”。由于《军民进行曲》的出现，引起了一番讨论。星海在这次讨论中对民族形式的要求有了进一步的了解。
    1939年春天，延安展开了一个自力更生的生产运动，这是毛主席巩固根据地的革命思想的具体实施。星海很快就投到这个运动里来，他最先创作了有名的《生产大合唱》。这首大合唱，可以说是星海的音乐作风变化的新起点。他用新的音乐语言，活跃、鲜明、热情而又带有强烈的民族色彩的曲调来歌颂这个运动。这首大合唱还没有正式演出，而《二月里来》、《酸枣子》等歌曲就响遍了每一个山头
  （那时主要是在山上开荒）。这里一群，那里一堆，一边劳动，一边唱歌，此起彼落，歌声像浪潮一样激动每个劳动者的心。
    《生产大合唱》受到延安人民的喜爱，他非常高兴，他看到他第一次对民族形式的尝试初步获得了效果，就确定不移地向这个方向进军了。
    那时抗敌演剧第三队正到延安来休整，他很快就和光未然同志合作起《黄河大合唱》来了。
    《黄河大合唱》是在五、六天中赶出来的。这首震撼全国的作品，表现了中国人民在无产阶级、党的领导下的革命意志，它的光辉一直照耀到现在，以至久远的将来。
    星海是一个特别勤勉的革命者，这首作品写完了，他又在捉摸一个新的念头。他觉得在党的直接领导下，要进一步为革命写作更多有意义的东西，但如何根据党所提出的艺术大众化、民族化的目标，作进一步的探索和有所建树，仍然还需要不断的努力。他希望在下一个作品来实践他的企图，而在开始之前需要多方面的给养，如研究民间音乐等。这下一个作品就是《九一八大合唱》。
    创作《九一八大合唱》，他有两个企图。一是他认为应该用乐观的音调来纪念这沉痛的节日，他说：“过去东北流行的关于‘九一八’的歌曲，多半带有过分伤感的情调，不能对群众起很大的鼓舞作用。”
    其次是，他要在这首新作中，尝试创造出更统一的民族风格。他在设计前和我们谈到这个企图，并且在写作中把一些段落念给我们听，看看这个作品是不是不管在旋律、节奏、乐器（特别是打击乐器）的应用，和声、对位的探索，转调的安排……都带有大胆的尝试性质。他要使这个作品的曲与曲之间比《黄河大合唱》更富变化而又更为统一。
    这两点，他认为是达到了；即使后来在莫斯科回忆起这首作品时，他也认为这种探索是很有意义的。他在札记中也提到“或许比《黄河大合唱》更统一些”，“这首大合唱在旋律、节奏和和声方面作者谨以尝试的态度去探索，不敢说有什么贡献，只是尽了抗战的一点微小的责任。”
    他在延安还写了《牺盟大合唱》、《梁红玉》、《反攻》、《打倒汪精卫》等优秀歌曲。他念念不忘于他正在完成的第一交响乐
  （《民族解放交响乐》）。他几次和我们谈起他的计划，给我们看他的草稿。他非常珍视这部作品，东奔西走，一直带在身边。但是，在延安，他只来得及把它写成钢琴谱。在他看来，这部交响乐是他那时候最心爱的，也是最能包括他的思想、意志的结晶品。后来他写成以后（在苏联完成），特别把它献给毛主席。他在札记中写着：“这作品我恳求贡献给伟大的毛泽东同志，他是我最崇拜的一位真正的民族救星，他的道路是正确的，只有这样才可以救中国，拯救整个民族的危亡。”
