    Only Thugs Allowed to Commit Violence, People Not Allowed to Assemble
    Japanese Authorities Announce Implementation of Fascist Decrees
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th -- The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has outrageously decided to apply the fascist "Public Safety Ordinance" to prohibit gatherings and demonstrations that have not been reported in advance, strengthening the suppression of the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle.
    According to today's "Sankei Shimbun" report, according to the decision of the Metropolitan Police Department, not only will gatherings and demonstrations that have not been reported in advance be prohibited, but even changes in the route of demonstrations and demonstrations near the Diet Building and in busy urban areas will be prohibited. If there are violations, "the police will use force to stop them." Prior to this, Zhou Dongyingxiong, the Minister of Autonomy and Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission, who took office on the 13th, publicly slandered the Tokyo citizens' spontaneous demonstration on the 13th to protest the fascist thugs' murder of Asanuma as an "illegal act" that had not been reported to the security authorities.
    These reactionary measures taken by the Ikeda government to suppress the people's struggle are entirely to meet the demands of Japanese monopoly capitalists. According to reports, the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, composed of monopoly capitalists, issued a statement on the 13th, openly urging the Ikeda government to strive to eliminate so-called "violent" actions in order to stabilize their reactionary rule.

    只许暴徒行凶　不准人民集会
    日本当局宣布实行法西斯法令
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：东京警视厅竟然决定要应用法西斯的“公安条例”，禁止事先没有呈报的集会和示威游行，加强镇压日本人民的爱国正义斗争。
    据“产经新闻”今天报道，根据警视厅的决定，不仅事先没有呈报的集会和游行，甚至连变更游行路线和到国会大厦附近以及在繁华市区举行的游行都将被禁止，如果有违反规定者，“警察将用实力阻止”。在这以前，13日上任的自治相兼国家公安委员长周东英雄在首次举行的记者招待会上公然诬蔑东京市民13日自动起来抗议法西斯暴徒杀害浅沼的示威游行是没有向治安当局呈报的“违法行为”。
    池田政府这些镇压人民斗争的反动措施完全是为了满足日本垄断资本家的要求而采取的。据报道，由垄断资本家组成的日本经营者团体联盟13日发表声明，公然催促池田政府努力排除所谓“暴力”行动，以谋稳定它们的反动统治。
