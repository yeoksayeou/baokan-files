Navy soldiers discuss "The Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895"

After the historical drama in eight acts, "The Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895," was performed in the navy's Beijing-based offices and troops, it was warmly welcomed by the majority of cadres and soldiers. Many people excitedly talked about their feelings. Here, we publish excerpts of some of their opinions:

Private Wang Delu:

After watching this play, I was very moved and also greatly educated. The old man with the white beard in the play, who only appeared once (referring to Li Hongzhang), was a high-ranking official of the Qing Dynasty. He organized the Beiyang Fleet and trained the navy, so he should have protected the motherland well. But when the imperialists attacked, Commander Deng and the sailors firmly demanded to fight, and the people also submitted a "ten thousand people petition" requesting to fight the devils, but he didn't allow it at all. The commander surnamed Fang was frightened by the devils, killed the patriotic helmsman in battle, raised the white flag, and deserted the battle, but was rewarded by the Qing government and Li Hongzhang upon his return, and wore the yellow jacket. Later, this guy simply became a traitor and sold out the country. The patriotic Commander Deng sympathized with the plight of the people and was so brave in battle, but he was almost dismissed by Li Hongzhang twice. This is truly "acting in reverse," how could we not be bullied by Japanese imperialism!

After watching this play, my understanding of imperialism became clearer. Japanese devils wanted to get rich by invasion, and British, American, and other imperialists were the same, so they colluded with each other to invade China. They played double-dealing tricks, pretending to be friends of China on the surface, helping China overtly, and helping the devils covertly, both deceiving people and getting rich, and pretending to be good people, catching three sparrows with one hand, everything was theirs, truly despicable!

I am a guard soldier. In the play, the Japanese spy Fukushima, sometimes posing as a businessman, sometimes posing as a staff member of foreign devils, was everywhere trying to gather military intelligence and carry out sabotage activities. This made me realize that the enemy has many conspiracies. In the future, I must be more vigilant, do a good job in guard duty, and prevent any sabotage activities by the enemy!

Five-Good Soldier, Sergeant Song Chengfu:

Now the people of the world have set off a high tide against imperialism. Performing this play exposes the aggressive face of imperialism and tells people that when imperialism attacks, fighting means survival and surrender means death. It is very educational. After watching this play, I know that sixty-six years ago, imperialism tried every means to bully us, cover up the sabotage activities of Japanese spies, and American imperialism even sold the American flag to Japanese devils, so that the devil's warships could fly it and attack us by surprise. Looking at the current aggressive activities of the United States, it proves that its nature has not changed at all. Whoever still has the slightest illusion about imperialism is being terribly fooled!

In peaceful days, we must be wary of complacency. What is imperialism if it doesn't invade! After watching this play, I further realized that this kind of complacency is absolutely unacceptable!

This play reveals that the Qing government was truly corrupt and reactionary! Sucking the people's blood and sweat, using naval military expenses to build the Summer Palace, and raising some soldiers only to put on a show, to oppress the people, and kowtowing and bowing to the imperialists. It's not that the soldiers of the Beiyang Fleet couldn't fight, it was that the reactionary ruling class wouldn't let them fight. That's how the war was lost. I will never forget the evils committed by the reactionary ruling class in the old society.

This play also made me think that imperialism often invades us from the sea. Our coastline is so long, it won't do without a strong sea defense. I further realized the importance of the navy's construction, and I love the navy's construction even more. Therefore, I am determined to contribute everything to the navy's construction, and vow to build our sea defense into an impregnable wall, and let anyone who comes to invade die under this impregnable wall!

Corporal Wang Zenghai:

This play is not only highly educational, but also very moving. What moved me most was the scene where the traitor Fang Renqi deserted in battle. Someone reported to Fang Renqi that the Guangyi was surrounded by the enemy, and the sailors demanded support from the brother ships, but he firmly refused to fire. The sailors were so anxious that they knelt down and begged him, but he still refused. Later, he personally killed the patriotic helmsman, raised the white flag, turned the rudder and ran away. Seeing this, I was really angered by this shameless guy!

It can be seen from the play that the people are patriotic, and most of the lower-level officers and soldiers are also patriotic, but the Beiyang Fleet also produced traitors like Fang Renqi, which suffered a great loss. Of course, the country now is completely different from the feudal country at that time. The broad masses of people are very enlightened, and the army is even more of the people. But the country is big and there are many troops, and in times of intense struggle, there will inevitably be people with unstable standpoints, and even bad elements. I am a guard soldier, and this play educates me to be vigilant, do my job well, and strictly prevent bad elements from taking the opportunity to sabotage.

Engineer, Lieutenant Feng Jiachao:

This play moved me greatly. Some scenes made me feel indignant. For example, Deng Shichang, representing the lower-level officers and soldiers and the broad masses of people, saw that the imperialist invasion was causing the people to live in misery, and resolutely demanded to resist imperialism, but the Qing government and the capitulationists represented by Li Hongzhang did everything possible to obstruct it, and twice attempted to dismiss Deng Shichang from his post. This made Deng Shichang have patriotic enthusiasm, but could not get his wish. Seeing these, I was really angry, it was simply a crime to be patriotic! Li Hongzhang didn't even allow mentioning the Japanese devils' pirate activities, it was really outrageous! Before liberation, I was studying in school. Thinking back to the reactionary government at that time, it was like this. After the incident of the American soldiers raping Chinese female students, the Kuomintang reactionaries didn't even dare to fart, and they didn't allow students to mention opposing American imperialism. If they mentioned it, they would be guilty. It can be seen that Chiang Kai-shek and Li Hongzhang were the same kind of goods. From this, I deeply realized how profound the meaning of Chairman Mao's solemn announcement on Tiananmen Square in 1949: From then on, the Chinese people have stood up! Yes, we have stood up, and no imperialism can ever bully us again!

Lieutenant Zhang Renjun:

This play is very successful in portraying the positive characters, the most prominent being Deng Shichang, the commander of the Zhiyuan ship. His heroic actions are very touching. For example, in the naval battle, when the fleet was facing the danger of being completely destroyed, he resolutely raised the commander's flag to attract the enemy's firepower to his own ship in order to save the brother ships. Finally, when there was no ammunition, he rammed the enemy ship with the ship itself. This kind of patriotic heroic behavior will always be a model for us to learn from. As a navy cadre, I must learn from the glorious fighting tradition of our predecessors and contribute all my strength to defending the motherland's sea defense.

Major Yang Zhaorui:

The educational significance of this play is very great. After watching it, I deeply realized this truth: what determines the victory or defeat of a war is not weapons and equipment, but people. When Japanese imperialism attacked, the Qing government was not only unprepared, but also suppressed the people's demands to resist the enemy, and fantasized about the so-called "mediation" of other imperialists. Contrary to the ruling class's policy of compromise and surrender, the lower-level officers and soldiers and the broad masses of the people resolutely resisted the imperialist aggression, and finally gave the imperialists and their running dogs a heavy blow. This shows that as long as we rely on the people, the motherland's territory will not be stained. Even if the enemy wins temporarily, they will eventually fail.

This play exposes the aggressive nature of imperialism. Sixty-six years ago, when Japanese imperialism invaded China, British and American imperialism were accomplices. Now that Japan has collapsed, American imperialism has become the number one enemy of our country and the people of the world. Whether accomplices or the number one enemy, they are all the same, imperialism is still imperialism, and the enemy is still the enemy, the nature has not changed, and it will never change. Any fantasy must be discarded, and only resolute struggle to the end will do.

### 海军战士谈《甲午海战》

    海军战士谈《甲午海战》
    八场历史话剧《甲午海战》在海军驻京机关、部队演出后，受到广大干部和战士的热烈欢迎。很多人都兴奋地谈到自己的感受，在这里，我们摘要发表其中一部分意见：
    列兵　王德禄：
    看了这出戏，很受感动，也受到很大的教育。戏里那个只出来过一回的白胡子老头（指李鸿章），是清朝的大官，他组织北洋水师，练海军，按说应该好好地保卫祖国。可是帝国主义打来了，邓管带和水兵们坚决要求打，老百姓也上“万民折”，请求打鬼子，他统统不准。姓方的管带叫鬼子吓破了胆，在战斗中打死爱国的舵手，挂起白旗，临阵脱逃，回来却受了清朝政府和李鸿章的奖赏，穿起了黄马褂。后来这家伙干脆当了汉奸卖国贼。爱国的邓管带同情老百姓的苦难处境，战斗中又那么勇敢，却两次差点儿被李鸿章革职。这真是“倒行逆施”，怎么能不受日本帝国主义欺侮！
    看了这出戏，对帝国主义的认识也更清楚了。日本鬼子想靠侵略发财，英、美等帝国主义也是这样，就互相勾结起来，侵略中国。它们耍两面派，表面上装成中国的朋友，明帮中国，暗帮鬼子，又坑人又发财，还装好人，一手捕仨雀，里外里都是他的，真卑鄙！
    我是个警卫战士。戏里那个日本特务福岛，一会儿装商人，一会儿装洋鬼子的随员，到处刺探军情，搞破坏活动。这使我认识到敌人的阴谋是很多的，今后一定要提高警惕，做好警卫工作，防止敌人的任何破坏活动！
    五好战士、上士　宋成福：
    现在全世界人民掀起了反帝国主义高潮，演这出戏揭露帝国主义的侵略面目，告诉人当帝国主义打来的时候，战就生，降就死，很有教育意义。看了这出戏，知道六十六年前帝国主义，就千方百计地欺负我们，掩护日本特务的破坏活动，美帝国主义连美国旗都卖给日本鬼子，叫鬼子的兵舰打着，偷袭我们。联系现在美国搞的侵略活动看，证明它的本性没有一点儿改变，谁要是对帝国主义还有半点儿幻想，就是上了天大的当！
    在和平的日子里，必须警惕和平麻痹思想，帝国主义不侵略还算什么帝国主义！看了这出戏，进一步认识这种麻痹思想万万要不得！
    这出戏揭露出清朝政府可真是腐败透了，反动透了！吸人民的血汗，用海军军费修颐和园，养了些兵，只为装门面，欺压人民，见了帝国主义就磕头作揖。北洋水师不是士兵不能打，是反动的统治阶级不让他们打，战争就是这样失败的。旧社会反动的统治阶级造下的孽，我一辈子也忘不了。
    这个戏还使我联想到，帝国主义常常从海上来侵略我们，我们的海防线那么长，没有坚强的海防还了得。我进一步认识到海军建设事业的重要，也就更加热爱海军建设事业。因此，我决心把自己的一切贡献给海军建设事业，誓把我们的海防建设成铜墙铁壁，不管谁来侵略，都让它死在这铜墙铁壁下！
    下士　王增海：
    这出戏不光教育意义大，也很感动人，特别受感动的是汉奸方仁启临阵脱逃的那场，有人向方仁启报告说广乙号被敌人包围，水兵们要求支援兄弟舰，他坚决不准开炮。水兵们急得给他跪下请求，他还是不准。后来竟亲手打死爱国的舵手，升起白旗，转舵逃跑了。看到这里，我真叫这个无耻的家伙气坏了！
    从戏里看出，人民群众是爱国的，大多数下层官兵也是爱国的，但北洋水师内部也出了像方仁启这样的叛徒，吃了大亏。现在国家当然和那时的封建国家完全不同了，广大的人民觉悟很高，军队更是人民的。但国家大，军队多，在斗争激烈的时候，也难免有立场不坚定的分子，甚至会出坏分子。我是个警卫战士，这个戏教育我要提高警惕，做好自己的工作，严防坏分子乘机破坏。
    工程师、上尉　封家超：
    这个戏使我受了很大的感动。有的场面使我感到义愤填膺。如以邓世昌为代表的下层官兵和广大的人民群众，见帝国主义的侵略使得民不聊生，坚决要求抗击帝国主义，而清政府和以李鸿章为代表的投降派却百般阻挠，并且两次企图革邓世昌的职。使得邓世昌空有爱国热情，而不能如愿以偿。看到这些，真是气愤极了，这简直是爱国有罪嘛！李鸿章连日本鬼子的海盗活动都不准提起，真是岂有此理！解放前我在学校读书，回想起那时的反动政府就是这个样子，美军强奸中国女学生事件发生后，国民党反动派连个屁也不敢放，还不准学生提反对美国帝国主义，提了就有罪，可见蒋介石、李鸿章是一类货。由此，我就更加深刻地体会到1949年毛主席在天安门上庄严地宣布：从此中国人民站起来了，这话的意义是多么深刻啊！是的，我们是站起来了，任何帝国主义再也休想欺侮我们了！
    上尉　张仁君：
    这个戏对正面人物的刻划很成功，最突出的是致远舰管带邓世昌，他的英雄行为很感人。如海战中当舰队面临全军复没的危险时，他毅然升起帅旗，把敌舰的火力吸引到自己的舰上来，以拯救兄弟舰。最后在没有弹药时，并以舰身撞击敌舰。这种爱国的英雄行为永远是我们学习的榜样。作为一个海军干部，我一定要学习前人的这种光荣的战斗传统，为保卫祖国海防贡献全部力量。
    少校　杨兆瑞：
    这出戏的教育意义很大。看后深深地体会到这样的真理：决定战争胜败的不是武器装备，而是人。日本帝国主义打来了，清朝政府不仅毫无准备，还压制人民的抗敌要求，幻想其他帝国主义所谓“调停”。与统治阶级的妥协投降政策相反，下层官兵和广大的人民群众则坚决抗击帝国主义的侵略，终于给了帝国主义及其走狗以沉重的打击。这说明只要依靠人民，祖国的领土就不会被沾污。即便敌人暂时胜利，最终也要失败。
    这出戏揭露了帝国主义的侵略本质，六十六年前，日本帝国主义侵略中国时，英美帝国主义是帮凶，如今日本垮了，美帝国主义成了我国和全世界人民的头号敌人。帮凶也好，头号敌人也好，反正都是一样的，帝国主义还是帝国主义，敌人还是敌人，本质没有改变，也永远不会改变。任何幻想都要丢掉，只有坚决斗争到底才行。
