Promote Mineral Powder Sintering, Vigorously Develop Man-Made Rich Ore

The ore used in the ironmaking workshop of Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory has low grade, much mineral powder, and relatively high sulfur content. However, they are not afraid of difficulties, dare to innovate, and insist on implementing the method of mineral powder sintering. As a result, they not only transformed the original low-grade lean ore into high-grade, high-basicity, low-sulfur, and low-oxidation man-made rich ore, but also utilized all available mineral resources as much as possible, such as unused powder ore, tailings (i.e., iron ore powder deposited in the sludge during ore washing), and return ore (i.e., mineral powder that cannot be sintered in one go). Due to the increase in the iron content of the ore, the utilization coefficient and pig iron qualification rate of the small blast furnace have been greatly improved, and the coke ratio and cost have been greatly reduced. It has become a red flag for small ironmaking enterprises to vigorously increase production and practice economy, and to achieve high-quality, high-yield, and low-consumption pig iron production, providing a good experience. Universally and conscientiously implementing this experience is of great practical significance for completing and overfulfilling this year's steel production plan.

Just as the increase in steel production requires a sufficient quantity and excellent quality of pig iron, the increase in pig iron production requires a more sufficient quantity of high-grade ore raw materials. Ore is the raw material of raw materials. The more ore there is and the higher the quality, the more solid the material foundation for increasing pig iron production. How can ironmaking enterprises always maintain a sufficient supply of ore? There are two ways: one is to prioritize the development of the mining industry and continuously increase ore production; the other is to practice strict economy, utilize all existing ore resources, and fully utilize the role of every ton of ore. That is to say, in the utilization of ore, we must not only emphasize increasing production, but also emphasize conservation. At present, we still have great potential to tap in the utilization of ore resources, especially a considerable part of the powder ore produced in the process of mining and crushing ore has not been utilized as it should be. Taking the Zhangdian Iron Plant in Zibo City, Shandong Province, as an example, in July this year, they dug up 8,000 tons of powder ore in the plant in less than a month. Utilizing this powder ore is enough to supply them with ore raw materials for 25 days. This number is obviously not the largest for many ironmaking plants and mines across the country. According to a rough estimate, Hunan Province alone has hundreds of thousands of tons of powder ore available for utilization. It is conceivable how much pig iron production will increase if ironmaking plants and mines in all provinces across the country utilize these powder ore, tailings, return ore, etc., that have not been utilized in the past! Because this part of the resources is utilized, how many working hours can be saved for the country's mining industry, and how many railway car transport capacity can be saved!

Realizing mineral powder sintering and vigorously developing man-made rich ore can not only fully utilize existing ore resources and ensure the needs of pig iron production, but more importantly, after implementing mineral powder sintering, the quality of ore can be greatly improved. The current experience of many small ironmaking enterprises proves that: large blast, high temperature, and refined materials are the basic measures to achieve high-yield, high-quality, and low-consumption pig iron. Although these three are closely linked, interact with each other, and are indispensable, they must be based on refined materials. Only by truly achieving refined materials, letting the blast furnace eat "fine grains" and "cooked materials", and implementing large blast and high temperature on the basis of eating dry, clean, uniform, and small, can the quality and yield of pig iron be guaranteed. Especially at present, most of the small blast furnaces have been technically transformed, and the equipment for blowing, air supply, and hot blast has been greatly improved, and the smelting capacity has also been significantly improved. In this case, how to achieve refined materials has become even more important. What is the most effective way to achieve refined materials? It is mineral powder sintering. According to general circumstances, the desulfurization efficiency of using the ore roasting method is only around 50%, while the desulfurization efficiency of using the mineral powder sintering method can reach more than 80% to 90%. By using the mineral powder sintering method, the ore has to go through a series of processes such as crushing, washing, magnetic separation, and roasting, and the effect of improving the ore grade is much greater than that of ore roasting. The ironmaking workshop of Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory originally put the ore into the furnace for ironmaking after roasting it once. The iron content of the ore entering the furnace was generally 38% to 40%. After using mineral powder sintering, the iron content of the sintered ore entering the furnace was increased to 65%. At the same time, in the process of implementing mineral powder sintering, it is also possible to overcome other unfavorable factors in natural ore for smelting through various aspects of work, improve the basicity of the ore, reduce the content of iron oxide, and control the particle size of the sintered ore. This can create favorable conditions for pig iron smelting before entering the furnace, and make people more active in mastering small blast furnace ironmaking. Therefore, promoting mineral powder sintering is a good thing that kills two birds with one stone. It can not only fully utilize ore resources and save mining and transportation capacity, but also universally improve the quality of ore and achieve high-quality, high-yield, and low-consumption pig iron.

So, how can we do a good job in mineral powder sintering? The experience of the ironmaking workshop of Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory tells us that the key issue lies in putting politics in command and launching a mass movement, and that leaders should go deep into the front line, go to the site to study and discover problems with the masses, and solve specific problems one by one without fear of trouble and without reluctance to work hard. It is very obvious that originally ore was roasted and then put into the blast furnace for ironmaking, but now mineral powder must be sintered before ironmaking, which will increase a lot of trouble in the work and encounter some difficulties. This requires a spirit of daring to revolutionize and constantly revolutionize. We must see that although the implementation of mineral powder sintering increases some trouble, it reduces a lot of trouble in the smelting process of the blast furnace, and can achieve high-quality, high-yield, and low-consumption, and increase the production of more high-quality pig iron. Why not be happy to increase some of this trouble? As for the difficulties, they are inevitable in adopting any new technology or new experience. These difficulties, in the vast majority of cases, are not inherent in this new technology or new experience, but because we are not familiar with it and have not mastered its regularity. The solution is to continue to familiarize ourselves with it in practice and master its regularity. For example, when Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory began to implement mineral powder sintering, they encountered the difficulty of high iron oxide, but they were not afraid of difficulties, constantly experimented, and "dissected" and analyzed furnace after furnace. In this way, they gradually mastered the regularity of mineral powder sintering and found out the reason for the high iron oxide, and as a result, they conquered the difficulties and achieved victory.

To promote mineral powder sintering, the workload of ore processing will inevitably increase, requiring a large amount of labor. This requires mobilizing the masses, carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, using indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods to implement mechanized and semi-mechanized production, and reducing the proportion of manual operations in the ore processing process such as crushing, washing, and magnetic separation as much as possible, so as to increase production without increasing manpower.

The experience of the ironmaking workshop of Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory in promoting mineral powder sintering and vigorously developing man-made rich ore is a successful experience. In the current movement to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel, all small ironmaking enterprises should learn and promote this good experience that can promote high-quality and high-yield pig iron.

    推广矿粉烧结　大办人造富矿
    济南印染厂炼铁车间所用的矿石，品位低，矿粉多，含硫量也比较高；但是，他们不畏困难，敢于革新，坚持实行矿粉烧结的办法，结果，不但把原来品位低的贫矿，变成了高品位、高碱度、低硫分、低氧化的人造富矿，而且把原来没有利用的粉矿、尾矿（即淘洗矿粉时沉淀于淤泥中的铁矿粉）和返矿（即一次烧结不住的矿粉）等一切可以利用的矿石资源都尽可能地利用起来。由于矿石含铁率的提高，小高炉的利用系数和生铁合格率都有很大提高，焦比和成本都有很大降低，成为全国小高炉的一面红旗，为小型炼铁企业厉行增产节约，实现生铁生产的优质、高产、低消耗提供了一条好经验。普遍地认真推行这个经验，对完成和超额完成今年钢铁生产计划，有着重要的实际意义。
    如同钢的增产需要数量充足和质量优良的生铁一样，生铁的增产需要更加充足的、高品位的矿石原料。矿石是原料的原料，矿石的数量愈多，质量愈高，生铁的增产就愈有坚实的物质基础。怎样才能使炼铁企业经常保有充足的矿石？办法有两条：一条是优先发展采掘工业，不断地增产矿石；一条就是厉行节约，把现有的矿石资源都利用起来，充分发挥每一吨矿石的作用。这就是说，在矿石的利用上，我们不仅要强调增产，而且要强调节约。目前我们在矿石资源的利用上，还有很大的潜力可挖，特别在采掘和粉碎矿石的过程中所产生的相当大的一部分粉矿，还没有得到应有的利用。以山东淄博市张店铁厂这个小型的炼铁厂为例，他们在今年七月间，仅仅用了不到一个月的时间，就在厂内挖出了八千吨粉矿。把这些粉矿利用起来，就足供他们二十五天需要的矿石原料。这个数字，对全国许多炼铁厂和矿山说来，显然不是最大的数字。据粗略的估算，仅湖南一省，可供利用的粉矿就有数十万吨之多。这就可以想见，全国各省的炼铁厂和矿山如果都把过去没有利用的这些粉矿，以及尾矿、返矿等等都利用起来，将会增产多少生铁！由于这部分资源被利用，又可以为国家节省多少个采掘工时，节省多少个车皮的运输力！
    实现矿粉烧结，大办人造富矿，不仅可以充分利用现有矿石资源，保证生铁增产需要，更重要的是实行矿粉烧结以后，可以大大提高矿石质量。目前许多小型炼铁企业的经验证明：大风、高温、精料是实现生铁高产、优质、低耗的基本措施。这三者虽是紧密联系，互为作用，缺一不可的，但又必须以精料为基础。只有在切实做到精料，让高炉吃“细粮”、“熟料”，并且在吃得干、净、匀、小的基础上实行大风、高温，生铁优质高产才有保证。特别是当前多数的小高炉都已经实行了技术改造，鼓风、送风和暖风的设备都有很大的改善，冶炼能力也有了显著的提高，在这种情况下，如何做到精料，就变得更加重要了。什么是做到精料的最有效办法呢？是矿粉烧结。根据一般的情况来看，采用矿石焙烧的办法脱硫，脱硫效率只在50％上下，而采用矿粉烧结的办法，脱硫效率就可以达到80％至90％以上。采用矿粉烧结的办法，矿石要经过粉碎、淘洗、磁选和焙烧的一系列过程，在提高矿石品位方面，也比矿石焙烧的效果大得多。济南印染厂炼铁车间原来是把矿石焙烧一下就入炉，入炉矿石的含铁率一般是38％至40％，采用矿粉烧结以后，入炉烧结矿石的含铁率就提高到了65％。同时，在实行矿粉烧结的过程中，还可以通过各方面的工作，克服天然矿石中的其它不利于冶炼的因素，提高矿石的碱度，降低氧化铁成分，控制烧结矿的粒度等。这就可以在入炉以前，为生铁冶炼创造有利条件，使人在掌握小高炉炼铁时，处于更加主动的地位。因此，推行矿粉烧结，是一箭双雕的好事，既可以充分地利用矿石资源，节省采掘和运输的能力，又可以普遍提高矿石的质量，实现生铁优质、高产、低消耗。
    那末，怎样才能做好矿粉烧结的工作呢？济南印染厂炼铁车间的经验告诉我们：关键的问题在于政治挂帅和大搞群众运动，在于领导深入第一线，到现场去和群众一起研究和发现问题，不怕麻烦，不辞辛苦地解决一个个具体问题。十分明显，原来是矿石焙烧一下就投入高炉炼铁，现在是矿粉要烧结以后才炼铁，在工作上是会增加许多麻烦，会遇到一些困难的。这就要有敢于革命、不断革命的精神。要看到实行矿粉烧结虽然增加了一些麻烦，却使高炉在冶炼过程中，减少了许多麻烦，并且可以做到优质、高产、低耗，增产更多的优质生铁，增加一些这种麻烦又何乐而不为呢？至于困难，则是采用任何一项新技术、新经验都不免要遇到的。这些困难，在绝大多数情况下都不是这项新技术、新经验所固有的，而是由于我们对它还不熟悉，还没有掌握它的规律性。解决的办法是要继续在实践中熟悉它，掌握它的规律。比如，济南印染厂在开始实行矿粉烧结时，就遇到了氧化铁高的困难，但是他们不怕困难，不断地试验，一炉炉地“解剖”、分析，这样，就逐步掌握了矿粉烧结的规律，摸清了氧化铁高的原因，结果征服了困难，取得了胜利。
    要推行矿粉烧结，矿石加工的工作量必然增多，需要大量的劳动力。这就要发动群众，开展技术革新和技术革命，用土办法和土洋结合的办法，实行机械化、半机械化的生产，尽可能多地减少粉碎、洗选、磁选等矿石加工过程中的手工操作的比重，做到增产不增人。
    济南印染厂炼铁车间推行矿粉烧结，大办人造富矿的经验是一个成功的经验。在目前以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，所有的小型炼铁企业都应当学习、推广这项能够促进生铁优质高产的好经验。
