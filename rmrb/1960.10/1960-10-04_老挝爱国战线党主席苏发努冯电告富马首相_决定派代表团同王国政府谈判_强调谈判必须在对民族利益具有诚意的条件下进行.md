　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 2nd – Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, announced in a telegram to Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Royal Government of Laos, that he had decided to send a delegation to hold negotiations with the Royal Government.

　　This telegram was broadcast by the Radio of the Laotian Fighting Forces on the 1st. In the telegram, Souphanouvong informed the Prime Minister of the Royal Government that the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front had decided to send a delegation composed of Phoumi Vongvichit (head of the delegation), Nouhak Phoumsavan (deputy head of the delegation), and Singapo Chounramany (member of the delegation) to participate in the negotiations with the Royal side.

　　The telegram said, "I would like to emphasize to the Prime Minister that the consistent position and attitude of the Lao Patriotic Front is to unswervingly support the government in resolutely realizing this only correct line that conforms to the national interests and the people's aspirations."

　　The telegram reviewed the past situation in Laos, stating, "After suffering military defeats in many places and being increasingly resisted by the people's struggle movement, as well as being strongly condemned by world public opinion, the U.S. imperialists are now employing their traditional despicable tactics, putting pressure on the King and the government, forcing them to make concessions to the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak rebel group, allowing them to rejoin the leadership of the government and the army, so as to gather all reactionary forces to persecute the people once again and undermine the path of peace, neutrality, and national harmony."

　　The telegram said, "Past experience has shown that concessions do not solve problems. On the contrary, doing so will reduce the people's trust in the government and the King, and at the same time, will prompt the motherland to fall back into the dark state of fratricide."

　　The telegram reiterated the importance of negotiations between the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao Royal Government. The telegram emphasized that in order to ensure that the negotiations achieve results and that cooperation can be lasting, the necessary conditions are: that the negotiations must be conducted in a spirit of sincerity towards the interests of the nation, in compliance with the principles of freedom and sincerity, and under conditions of guarantee. These conditions have been clearly put forward by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front in its statement issued on September 30. As previously reported, the conditions put forward by the Lao Patriotic Front include: resolutely opposing the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak traitorous group, guaranteeing the people's democratic rights; forming a coalition government; immediately establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and all countries that respect Laotian sovereignty; and opposing the Southeast Asia military aggressive bloc and United Nations intervention.

　　The telegram then pointed out that if these guaranteed conditions are not met, then the agreements that have been and will be signed will be easily undermined. The painful lessons of 1958 have already illustrated this fact.

    老挝爱国战线党主席苏发努冯电告富马首相
    决定派代表团同王国政府谈判
    强调谈判必须在对民族利益具有诚意的条件下进行
    新华社河内2日电　老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王在给老挝王国政府首相梭发那·富马亲王的电报中宣布，决定派遣一个代表团同王国政府举行谈判。
    这份电报已经由寮国战斗部队电台在1日广播。苏发努冯在电报中通知王国政府首相，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会已决定派遣由富米·冯维希（团长）、努哈·富米沙万（副团长）、辛加波·宗拉马利（团员）组成的代表团，参加这次同王国方面举行的谈判。
    电报说，我谨着重告诉首相，老挝爱国战线党一贯的立场和态度是，始终不渝地支持政府坚决实现这个符合民族利益和人民的愿望的唯一正确的路线。
    电报回顾了老挝过去的局势后说，在许多地方遭到军事上的失败和越来越遭到人民的斗争运动的反抗以及世界舆论的强烈谴责之后，美帝国主义现在耍出了它们传统的卑鄙手法，向国王和政府施加压力，迫使它们向富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛乱集团作出让步，让他们重新参加政府和军队的领导工作，以便纠集一切反动力量再一次迫害人民，破坏和平中立和民族和睦路线。
    电报说，过去的经验表明，让步解决不了问题，相反地，这样做会削减人民对政府和国王的信赖，同时会促使祖国重新陷入兄弟相残的黑暗状态。
    电报重申老挝爱国战线党同老挝王国政府谈判的重要性。电报强调，为了保障谈判取得结果，合作能够持久，必要的条件是：谈判必需在对民族的利益具有诚意、遵守自由和真诚的原则、具有保障性质的条件下进行。这些条件，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会已在9月30日发表的声明中明确地提出。前已报道，老挝爱国战线党提出的条件包括：坚决反对富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛国集团，保证人民民主权利；成立联合政府；立即同苏联、中国和越南民主共和国和一切尊重老挝主权的国家建交；反对东南亚军事侵略集团和联合国干涉。
    电报接着指出，如果不具备这些具有保障性质的条件，那么，已经和将要签订的协议将会轻易地遭到破坏。1958年的沉痛教训已经说明了这个事实。
