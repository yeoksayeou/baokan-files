    Jin Fengshan

    Comrade Jin Fengshan, the leader of the rural survey and research group of Xiangyang Prefecture General Machinery Factory, a fitter, and a Communist Party member, is a bright red banner in Hubei Province's industrial support for agricultural technical transformation.
    Since entering the General Machinery Factory (formerly known as Xinguang Iron Factory) in the summer of 1954, Jin Fengshan has wholeheartedly supported agricultural technical transformation for six years. During these six years, he has been to rural areas in more than a dozen counties in the province, including Xiangyang, Zaoyang, Dangyang, Xiaogan, Xianning, and Macheng, as well as minority areas near Kunming, Yunnan Province, to create, improve, and repair agricultural tools and impart technology. He created and improved thirty-one new types of agricultural tools and personally taught many farmers how to use and repair them.
    He often said, "Agricultural affairs are industrial affairs, and supporting agriculture is the duty of workers." It is under the guidance of this thought that he demonstrated a lofty communist labor attitude in supporting agriculture.
    Jin Fengshan is a skilled hand at improving old agricultural tools and manufacturing new ones. In manufacturing agricultural tools, he paid special attention to quality and resolutely opposed the practice of only managing production without caring about usefulness. From the continuous increase in wheat production, the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered that the three-row automatic seed drill created by the Pangong Commune in Xiangfan City was a good tool, but it still had some problems that needed to be improved. In July of this year, the Prefectural Committee assigned this task to Jin Fengshan. Although the original Pangong-style three-row automatic seed drill could automatically drop seeds, the seed breakage rate was as high as 20%. After collective research by Jin Fengshan and six or seven carpenters, including Luo Xiaohua from the factory's woodworking shop, and five revisions, the seed breakage rate was reduced to three per thousand. At that time, some people said, "The seed breakage rate of ten-row seed drills is 15 to 20 per thousand, so three per thousand is the best." However, Jin Fengshan did not think so. He said, "Generally, one tael of wheat has more than 800 grains. If 20 jin are sown per mu, that's more than 250,000 grains. If three out of every thousand grains are broken, more than 800 grains will be wasted per mu, which is equivalent to one tael of wheat. If you calculate the whole area, how big a loss would that be! Furthermore, consider that one grain of wheat can produce a dozen to twenty sprouts, so one or two thousand spikes of wheat less will be produced per mu, which will have a great impact on wheat production!" So he continued to reform and finally eliminated the phenomenon of seed breakage, so that the integrity rate of the Pangong-style three-row automatic seed drill generally reached 100%.
    Jin Fengshan is also an "agricultural tool repair expert." He attaches great importance to repair work and always carries tools with him, repairing any broken agricultural tools he sees. Once, he and a worker from the factory went to Guanghua County to teach the technique of converting double-wheeled double-share plows. When they arrived at Zhangji, some farmers took out three broken powder sprayers and asked if they could repair them. Jin Fengshan said "Yes," and took them and began repairing. After repairing them, he left without even having a cup of tea. On the way, the worker said, "Old Jin, you take care of things you shouldn't. Those powder sprayers weren't made by our factory, and we didn't come down here to repair powder sprayers, so why did you help them repair them?" Jin Fengshan said, "What's the difference between things we should take care of and things we shouldn't? As long as it's a matter for the masses, we should take care of it. No matter which factory made them, how could I live with myself if I saw they were broken and didn't repair them!"
    Jin Fengshan is also like a seed drill, enthusiastically passing on his skills to the farmers. Every time he goes to a place, he always brings back a batch of apprentices. Once, he went to Zaoyang County to teach the technique of converting and using double-wheeled double-share plows. One day after lunch, he took more than thirty young people from Xinshi to a field next to the highway to try out the converted double-wheeled double-share plow. People passing by on the highway saw how well it plowed and said, "We want to learn too!" Before long, more than a dozen people gathered around, some carrying loads, some pulling carts, and some going to market. By this time, the sun was setting, and some of the young people from Xinshi said, "Master Jin, you've been tired all day, go back and rest!" However, Jin Fengshan enthusiastically disassembled the plow, explaining the name, conversion method, and specifications of each part to the passersby, then reassembled the disassembled plow, plowed for them to see, and held their hands to let them try plowing themselves. The passersby happily said as they left, "Coming out today was like getting a free lesson!"
    From his many years of experience, Jin Fengshan deeply realized that to support agriculture well, one must not only be proficient in one's own profession, but also have a good understanding of agriculture. Therefore, he always pays attention to learning agricultural production knowledge, understanding the performance of various agricultural tools, and learning from farmers with an open mind. When manufacturing and repairing agricultural tools, he often works with farmers to research and repeatedly experiment on site, instead of relying on subjective "closed-door car making." In 1956, Xiangyang Prefecture universally promoted close planting of wheat. The old-fashioned weeding hoes produced by the General Machinery Factory could no longer meet the needs. The factory asked Jin Fengshan to go to the countryside to find out what kind of weeding hoes were needed after close planting of wheat. Jin Fengshan came to Huopai Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangyang County. The members were working in the wheat fields, and he joined them. 社员高桂枝 Member Gao Guizhi said: "You've come at the right time, we're worried: this year's wheat is densely planted, the old weeding hoes are too wide, can your factory make some narrow weeding hoes?" Jin Fengshan asked, "How many inches wide is appropriate?" The members started discussing one after another. When they took a break, Jin Fengshan and the members measured the row spacing of the wheat seedlings together, the densest being four inches. Jin Fengshan asked again, "After the wheat grows, how wide should the row spacing be when weeding?" The members calculated together: "Three and a half or seven inches." Jin Fengshan said, "In that case, how about making them three and a third inches wide?" The members all said it was appropriate. Jin Fengshan returned to the factory and reported the farmers' opinions to the leaders, drew a sketch, and the forging workshop made two samples. After the samples were made, he took the samples to the Huopai Agricultural Cooperative to ask the members to evaluate them. The members took them to the fields for a test, and the width was very suitable, but the back of the hoe was flat. Jin Fengshan returned to the factory to make changes, and then took it to the Huopai Agricultural Cooperative for testing; later, he made another change based on the farmers' opinions, and then sent it to the suburban agricultural cooperative of Xiangfan City to ask the members to evaluate it, and they all said "Very good."
    Comrade Jin Fengshan's exemplary deeds of wholeheartedly supporting agricultural technical transformation for six years have been repeatedly praised by the Party and the people. Now, the staff and workers of the industrial and transportation departments of Xiangyang Prefecture have launched a wave of learning from Jin Fengshan.

    金凤山

    襄阳专区通用机械厂的农村调查研究组组长、钳工、共产党员金凤山同志，是湖北省工业支援农业技术改造的一面鲜艳的红旗。
    金凤山从1954年夏季进入通用机械厂（原名新光铁工厂）以来，六年如一日地全心全意支援农业技术改造。六年中，他为了创制、改良、修配农具和传授技术，到过省内襄阳、枣阳、当阳、孝感、咸宁、麻城等十几个县的农村，还到过云南省昆明市附近的少数民族地区。他创制和改良了三十一种新式农具，还亲手教会许多农民使用和修配新式农具。
    他经常这样说：“农业的事就是工业的事，支援农业是工人的本分。”正是在这种思想支配下，他在支援农业中表现了崇高的共产主义劳动态度。
    金凤山是一个改良旧农具和制造新式农具的能手。在制造农具中，他特别注意质量，对那种只管制不管用的作法坚决反对。中共襄阳地委从小麦连年增产中，发现襄樊市庞公公社创制的三行自动条播器是一种很好的条播工具，但还有一些毛病，需要改进。今年7月间，地委把这个任务交给了金凤山。原来庞公式三行自动条播器虽然能自动下籽，但破籽率高达20％。经过金凤山和厂里木工车间罗小华等六、七个木工一起集体研究，改了五次，破籽率降到了千分之三。当时，有的人就说：“十行播种机的破籽率都有千分之十五到二十，千分之三算最好了。”但是，金凤山却不这样想，他说：“一般的小麦一两有八百多粒，一亩田如果下二十斤，就是二十五万多粒，一千粒破三粒，一亩田就要浪费八百多粒，正合一两麦，全区算起来，该是多大损失！再算算一粒麦要发十几个到二十几个头，一亩田就要少出一、两千刁麦，这对小麦增产影响多大！”于是他又继续改革，终于消灭了破籽现象，使“庞公式”三行自动条播器的下籽完好率一般都达到百分之百。
    金凤山又是一个“农具修理专家”。他把修配工作看得很重要，随身总是带着工具，看到坏了的农具就修理。有一次，他和厂里的一个工人，到光化县传授改装双轮双铧犁的技术。走到张集，有的农民拿出三部坏喷粉器，问他两人能不能修。金凤山说了声“能修”，接过手就修起来。修理好后，茶也没喝一杯就走了。走在路上，那个工人说：“我说老金，不该管的事你也要管。那个喷粉器又不是我们厂出的，我们下来又不是修理喷粉器，为什么要帮他修呢？”金凤山说：“哪是该管的事，哪是不该管的事？只要是群众的事就该管。不管是哪个厂出的，看到坏了不修，心里怎么过的去！”
    金凤山又像一部播种机，把自己的技术热心地传授给农民，每到一个地方总要带会一批徒弟。有一次，他到枣阳县传授改装和使用双轮双铧犁的技术。一天吃过午饭，带着新市的三十多个青年在公路旁边的田里，试用改装了的双轮双铧犁。公路上过路的人看到犁得好，就说：“我们也来学一学！”不大一会，就围拢来十几个人，有挑担子的，有拉车的，有赶集的。这时太阳快落下去了，新市的一些青年就说：“金师傅，你累了一天，回去歇歇吧！”但是，金凤山却兴致勃勃地又把犁拆散，一件件地给那些过路的人讲解每个部件的名称、改装办法、规格，然后又把拆散的犁装起来，犁给他们看，还扶着手叫他们自己犁着试验。过路的人临走高兴地说：“今天出门，算住了一趟不要钱的学！”
    金凤山从自己多年的经验中，深刻地认识到要支援好农业，不光要精通本行的业务，还要十分了解农业。因此，他时刻注意学习农业生产知识，了解各种农具的性能，虚心向农民学习。他制造和修理农具，经常和农民一起研究，在现场反复试验，不凭主观“闭门造车”。1956年，襄阳专区普遍推广小麦密植。通用机械厂生产的旧式薅锄，已不能适应需要。厂里就叫金凤山下乡了解小麦密植后要用什么样的薅锄。金凤山来到襄阳县伙牌农业社。社员们正在麦田里做活，他也参加到里面一起干。社员高桂枝说：“你来得正好，我们正在发愁：今年小麦密植，老薅锄宽了，你们厂能不能打些窄薅锄？”金凤山就问：“几寸宽合适？”社员们你一言我一语地讨论开了。歇气的时候，金凤山和社员们一起量了麦苗的行距，最密的是四寸。金凤山又问：“麦子发蔸后，到锄草时还该有多宽的行子？”社员们一合计：“还有三寸六、七”。金凤山就说：“那样的话，打三寸三宽行不行？”社员们都说合适。金凤山回到厂里向领导汇报了农民的意见，画了个图样，由锻压车间打了两张样版。样版打好了，他又拿着样版到伙牌农业社请社员们鉴定。社员们拿到田里一试验，宽窄很合适，就是锄背打平了。金凤山回厂作了修改，又拿到伙牌农业社试验；后来又根据农民意见改了一次，再送到襄樊市郊区农业社请社员们鉴定，都说“好得很”。
    金凤山同志六年如一日地全心全意支援农业技术改造的模范事迹，得到党和人民的多次表扬。现在，襄阳专区工业交通部门的职工已经掀起了学习金凤山的热潮。
