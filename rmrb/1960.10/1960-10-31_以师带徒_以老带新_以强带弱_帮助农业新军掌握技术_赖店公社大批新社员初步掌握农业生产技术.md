According to the Fujian Daily, the Laidian Commune in Xianyou, Fujian Province, is actively helping new commune members who have come to the forefront to improve their agricultural production skills, enabling them to quickly master production techniques and exert their strength.

These new commune members who returned to the forefront of agriculture are eager to quickly familiarize themselves with agricultural knowledge and master agricultural technology. In response to this situation, the commune party committee decided to strengthen technical training for this new agricultural force. Specific approaches are:

I. Mentoring. The entire commune organized more than 600 experienced veteran farmers to serve as technical instructors, each taking in a group of commune members unfamiliar with agricultural technology as apprentices, enabling them to quickly learn the most urgently needed agricultural skills. The Laidian Brigade Party Branch organized 41 veteran farmers from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds to take in 74 young people who had just arrived at the forefront, ensuring comprehensive teaching and learning. Chen Chunsisi, an old farmer from the first production team of Jintian Brigade, has more than 30 years of rich experience in farming, is familiar with agricultural timing and various production techniques, and is a well-known production expert in the production team. This time, he is responsible for teaching nine apprentices, concentrating on training, practicing separately, checking daily, and conducting a general evaluation every ten days, so that these commune members who have just arrived at the forefront quickly learned the most basic agricultural techniques. In less than 20 days, four commune members could plow the fields, and seven learned to burn soil and other farm work.

II. Old Guiding New. In addition to veteran farmers providing mentorship, there is also widespread use of veterans helping novices, and those who have been sent down for a long time leading those newly sent down. For example, four staff members from Jintian Brigade were sent down to the forefront of agriculture two months ago. They became familiar with agricultural technology earlier and have undergone a period of practical training. So, they were invited to share their experiences and how they learned agricultural technology, leading the newly sent-down commune members through their example. Commune member Chen Liangyou was sent down to the forefront of agriculture in the previous stage and has learned agricultural techniques such as harrowing fields, carrying soil, burning fertilizer, and field management. He led the newly sent-down commune member Chen Guozhong, helping him quickly learn many agricultural skills.

III. Strong Leading Weak. That is, strong laborers lead weak laborers. Each production team is matched according to labor strength and technical level, so that they can drive and help each other in labor, ensuring that various farm tasks are completed on time, with quality, and in quantity.

In helping new farmers who have just arrived at the forefront of agriculture improve their agricultural skills, efforts are also made to ensure that those who teach do so patiently and those who learn do so with humility. The methods of imparting technology progress from easy to difficult, from coarse to fine, from key points to overall, and from basic to comprehensive, step by step, and improve step by step. After adopting these methods, the atmosphere of learning agricultural technology at the forefront of agricultural production in the entire commune is very strong. Diligent study and hard practice can be seen everywhere, whether on the mountains, in the fields, while walking, eating, before and after work, and during rest. Chen Zhongmen, an old commune member in his seventies, was greatly encouraged when he saw this situation. He said, "Seeing such a new atmosphere today, I can't sit idle either." Ignoring everyone's persuasion, he went to work to collect manure for three consecutive days, already collecting 90 catties. With the concerted efforts of new and old commune members, the commune completed the winter planting and fertilizer accumulation task 20 days ahead of schedule; autumn harvest preparations were also greatly accelerated, and the late-stage management of autumn fields was done very well.

    以师带徒  以老带新  以强带弱
    帮助农业新军掌握技术
    赖店公社大批新社员初步掌握农业生产技术
    据福建日报消息　福建省仙游赖店公社积极帮助到第一线的新社员提高农业生产技术，使他们迅速掌握生产技术，发挥力量。
    这次回到农业第一线的新社员，都迫切要求迅速熟悉农业知识，掌握农业技术。公社党委针对这一情况，决定加强对这支农业新军进行技术训练。具体作法是：
    一、以师带徒。全社组织六百多个富有经验的老农担任技术指导，每人都收一批不熟悉农业技术的社员为学徒，使他们迅速学会最迫切需要掌握的农业技术。赖店大队党支部组织了四十一个贫农、下中农出身的老农收带了七十四个刚到第一线的青年为徒弟，做到包教包学包到底。锦田大队第一生产队老农陈春思已有三十多年种田务农的丰富经验，对农时和各项生产技术都比较熟悉，是生产队有名的生产能手，这一次他负责包教学徒九人，集中培训，分头操练，一天一检查，十天一总评，使这些刚到第一线的社员很快学会了最基本的农业技术，不到二十天，已有四个社员会犁田，七个社员学会烧火土和其他农活。
    二、以老带新。除由老农包教外，还广泛运用老手帮新手，下放久的带新下放的。如锦田大队有四个职工是前两个月下放到农业第一线的，他们早一步熟悉了农业技术，并且经过了一段实际锻炼，于是就请他们介绍经验，介绍自己怎样学会农业技术的，通过他们带动新下放的社员。社员陈良油是前一阶段下放到农业第一线的，已经学会耙田、挑土、烧肥、田间管理等农业技术，他就带领新下放的社员陈国忠，帮助他很快学会了不少农业技术。
    三、以强带弱。就是由强劳力来带弱劳力，各个生产队都按劳力强弱、技术高低，互相搭配，由他们在劳动中互相带动，互相帮助，保证各项农活按时按质按量完成任务。
    在帮助刚到农业第一线的新农民提高农业技术中，还做到教的人耐心地教，学的人虚心地学。传授技术的方法从易到难，从粗到细，从重点到全面，从基础到整体，步步深入，步步提高。采用这些办法后，全社农业生产第一线学习农业技术的气氛十分浓厚。无论在山上、田里、走路、吃饭、收工前后以及休息的时候，勤学苦练的情景，到处可见。七十多岁的老社员陈忠门看到这种情景，大受鼓舞，他说：“看到今天这样新气象，我也闲不住了。”他不听大家劝说，一连三天出工拾粪，已拾到九十斤。在新老社员一致努力下，全社提前二十天完成了冬种积肥任务；秋收准备也大大加快，秋田后期管理搞得很好。（附图片）
