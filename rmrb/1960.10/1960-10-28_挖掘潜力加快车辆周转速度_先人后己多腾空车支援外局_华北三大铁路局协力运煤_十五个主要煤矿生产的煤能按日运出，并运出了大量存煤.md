Xinhua News Agency, October 27th. Beijing, Taiyuan, and Hohhot Railway Bureaus, focusing on increasing coal transportation to guarantee increased steel production, worked hand in hand, supported each other, and shipped the coal produced by the fifteen major coal mines in North China daily, while also shipping a large amount of stock coal.

The coal transportation volume of these three bureaus is close to one-third of the national railway coal transportation volume. Among them, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, which is responsible for the transportation tasks of the four major coal mines of Datong, Yangquan, Xishan, and Fenxi in Shanxi, faces a shortage of vehicles because the number of vehicles arriving for unloading is far less than the number of vehicles loaded and shipped out. Some raw coal is backlogged in the mines and cannot be shipped out. The entire staff of the Beijing and Hohhot Railway Bureaus actively undertook the task of supporting the Taiyuan Bureau with vehicles on a daily basis to jointly rush to transport coal from Shanxi.

The Beijing Railway Bureau resolutely implemented the principle of prioritizing others before oneself and prioritizing external needs before internal needs in vehicle deployment, prioritizing the transfer of more than 1,000 empty vehicles to the Taiyuan Bureau every day. They adopted five measures: First, specifically arrange empty vehicles to be sent to Taiyuan every day. When there are many empty vehicles, send them to Taiyuan first. When there are few empty vehicles, reduce the transportation volume of non-priority materials and prioritize the supply of empty vehicles to Taiyuan. Second, earnestly ensure the quality of empty vehicles so that they can be quickly sent to the mining areas to transport coal upon arrival. Third, focusing on organizing fast direct empty vehicles, vigorously innovate the organization of empty vehicle dispatch. Currently, the number of fixed direct empty vehicles from the Beijing Bureau to the coal mine production areas in Shanxi has greatly increased. This type of train runs on fixed points and lines at the fastest speed, without needing to stop for operations along the way. Fourth, various materials transported from the Beijing Railway Bureau to Shanxi Province should be transported as early as possible, so that the vehicles transporting these materials can participate in coal transportation after unloading in Shanxi. Fifth, increase large locomotives and improve transportation organization to vigorously improve the railway's transportation capacity.

The Hohhot Railway Bureau cooperated with some factories and enterprises to strengthen internal transportation within the factories, shortening the time vehicles stayed in factories waiting to be loaded and unloaded. This effectively improved vehicle turnover rate, basically ensuring that the Hohhot Bureau could free up 200 empty vehicles to be transferred to Shanxi for coal loading every day.

With the strong support of brother bureaus, the staff of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau tried every possible means to overcome difficulties and improve transportation efficiency. They regularly made preparations for receiving vehicles in terms of locomotives, lines, etc. As soon as the vehicles arrived, they immediately sent them to the mining area for coal loading at the fastest speed. At the same time, they vigorously promoted streamlined loading and unloading to improve loading and unloading efficiency. Since the beginning of this month, the average number of vehicles unloaded by this bureau every day has exceeded the state plan by more than 100, which is equivalent to increasing the number of operating vehicles by more than 100 every day.

In order to better organize communist cooperation and jointly complete the transportation tasks of coal and other key materials with guaranteed quality and quantity, these three bureaus recently established the North China Railway Transportation Command under the leadership of the Ministry of Railways, strengthened the education of a global perspective among employees, and unified the command of the daily transportation work of the three bureaus and the dispatch of vehicles of the three bureaus.

After the above series of efforts, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau currently has more operating vehicles than planned. In addition to ensuring the daily shipment of newly produced coal and the planned removal of stock coal, it has also begun to reserve a certain number of spare empty vehicles in some major mining areas. The coal transportation volume of this railway bureau increased by 130,000 tons in September compared to August, and the average daily transportation volume from October 1st to 20th increased by more than 3,100 tons compared to the daily average in September. At the same time, the coal transportation volume of the Beijing and Hohhot bureaus is also rising. Compared with September, the average daily total coal transportation volume of these three bureaus increased by 8% in the first and middle ten days of October, and the total freight volume increased by 5.4%.

    挖掘潜力加快车辆周转速度　先人后己多腾空车支援外局
    华北三大铁路局协力运煤
    十五个主要煤矿生产的煤能按日运出，并运出了大量存煤
    新华社27日讯　北京、太原、呼和浩特三个铁路局，以多装快运煤炭保证钢铁增产为中心，携手协作，互相支援，按日运出华北十五个主要煤矿出产的煤，同时还运出了大量存煤。
    这三个局的运煤量接近全国铁路运煤量的三分之一。其中担负山西大同、阳泉、西山、汾西四大煤矿运输任务的太原铁路局，由于到达卸车的车辆远远少于装车外运的车辆，车辆来源不足，部分原煤积压在矿山运不出来。北京和呼和浩特两铁路局的全体职工，就积极担当起按日向太原局支援车辆的任务，来共同抢运山西的煤。
    北京铁路局在车辆运用上坚决贯彻先人后己、先外后内的原则，每天优先把一千多辆空车调往太原局。他们采取了五条措施：一、每天具体安排送往太原的空车。空车多时，先送给太原，空车少时就压缩自己非重点物资的运输量，优先给太原供应空车。二、认真保证空车的质量，使空车到达后很快就可以送往矿区运煤。三、以组织快速直达空车为中心，大力革新空车排送组织工作，目前由北京局开往山西煤矿产地的固定直达空车，已大大增加。这种列车定点定线，以最快的速度运行，途中不需要停站作业。四、由北京铁路局运往山西省的各种物资，尽可能的先运输，使运送这些物资的车辆到达山西卸货以后，就可以参加运煤。五、增加大型机车、改进运输组织工作，大力提高铁路的运输能力。
    呼和浩特铁路局和一些工厂企业协作，加强厂内运输，压缩了车辆停留在工厂等装等卸的时间，这就有效地提高了车辆周转率，基本上保证呼和浩特局每天能腾出二百辆空车调到山西装煤。
    太原铁路局职工在兄弟局的大力支援下，千方百计克服困难，提高运输效率。他们在机车、线路等各方面，经常做好接车准备，车辆一到，立即用最快的速度送到矿区装煤。同时大搞装卸滑溜化，提高装卸效率。这个局从本月初以来，每天平均卸车数超过国家计划一百多辆，等于每天增加了一百多辆运用车。
    为了更好地组织共产主义大协作，共同保质保量地完成煤炭和其他重点物资运输任务，最近这三个局已在铁道部领导下成立了华北铁路运输指挥所，在职工中加强全局观点的教育，统一指挥三局的日常运输工作和调度三局的车辆。
    经过上述一系列努力，太原铁路局目前掌握的运用车辆已超过了计划，除了保证按日运出新产煤和有计划地拉出存煤以外，还在一些主要矿区开始储备了一定数量的备用空车。这个铁路局9月运煤量比8月增加了十三万吨，10月1日至20日平均每天又比9月每天多运三千一百多吨。与此同时，北京、呼和浩特两局的运煤量也在上升。和9月比较，10月上、中旬，这三局每日平均运煤总数增加了8％，货运总量增加了5.4％。（附图片）
