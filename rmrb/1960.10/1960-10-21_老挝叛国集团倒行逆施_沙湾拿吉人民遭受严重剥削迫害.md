Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th: The Lao Fighting Forces Radio broadcast on the 17th: Some employees and businessmen from Savannakhet to Vientiane said that people from all walks of life in Savannakhet are suffering from serious exploitation and persecution by the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Naciamphasak traitorous clique. They prohibit merchants from doing business anywhere, and all merchants are monitored and controlled by them. Some merchants have been imprisoned on false charges of being spies for Prince Souvanna Phouma and the coup committee. People from Savannakhet said that the rebel group's army and police have not received their salaries for two months. Students and staff are also forced to become soldiers and are forced to undergo military training every day.

They revealed that the Savannakhet traitorous clique also prohibits people from listening to Vientiane Radio and Lao Fighting Forces Radio broadcasts, prohibits gatherings of more than three people, and stipulates that one person from each household is responsible for inspection. If anyone violates the above prohibitions, that person will be held responsible. A businessman said that Savannakhet is currently like a prison.
