Small Data

    The "Dense Zones" of South Vietnam are a fascist measure proposed and implemented by the Ngo Dinh Diem group last year to oppose communism and the people. It forces the people of South Vietnam to live in designated areas. These areas are surrounded by barbed wire or deep ditches, and are connected to major cities by road networks or waterways. Within the "Dense Zones," there are sentry posts everywhere, and armed military police are on guard day and night. Residents must report to the military police when entering or leaving. In the "Dense Zones," each household is only allocated a small piece of land to make a living, so they live a life of semi-starvation, and are also subjected to all kinds of humiliation and abuse by the puppet military police.

    The Ngo Dinh Diem group, following the instructions of its American masters, established "Dense Zones" to intensify the persecution of former resistance personnel and strengthen the suppression of the people of South Vietnam, in order to continue to divide Vietnam and make South Vietnam a colony of the United States and a base for opposing China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This traitorous and reactionary policy has been strongly opposed by the people of South Vietnam.

    越南南方的“稠密区”
    越南南方的“稠密区”是吴庭艳集团在去年提出和实行的一项反共反人民的法西斯措施。它强迫越南南方人民集居到指定的地区。在这些地区四周围以铁丝网或深沟，同时用公路网或河道把这些“稠密区”和各大城市相连接。“稠密区”内岗哨林立，武装军警日夜警戒，居民进出都得向军警报告。在“稠密区”里，每户人家只分得一小块土地以为生，因此过的是半饥半饱的生活，而且还遭受到伪军警的百般凌辱摧残。
    吴庭艳集团秉承美国主子的意旨建立“稠密区”的目的，是为了加紧对前抗战人员的迫害，加强对越南南方人民的镇压，以便继续分裂越南，使越南南方成为美国的殖民地和反对中国和越南民主共和国的基地。这一卖国反动政策遭到越南南方人民的强烈反对。
