With the deepening of the mass movement to sell agricultural and sideline products across the country, the work of processing agricultural and sideline products has been placed on the agenda with increasing urgency.

The initial processing of agricultural and sideline products is a continuation of agricultural production and an important link in the comprehensive completion of the task of purchasing agricultural and sideline products. The procurement of agricultural and sideline products, from harvesting, processing, delivery, and sales to transportation, is a series of processes that are interlinked, influencing and promoting each other. After a large harvest of agricultural products, whether the processing work can keep up closely becomes a crucial key to whether the task of purchasing agricultural and sideline products can be completed comprehensively and promptly. A large amount of grain and oil crops must be initially processed to provide for consumption and storage. Many technical crops such as cotton, tobacco, and hemp need to be initially processed to reduce weight and volume for easy transportation to supply industrial sectors for production. Many wild plants cannot be used at all without initial processing. If all these agricultural and sideline products cannot be processed in time after harvest, they will accumulate in large quantities. This will not only directly affect the progress of procurement but also potentially cause various losses and waste due to difficulty in storage. Therefore, while harvesting in large quantities, making every effort to do a good job in processing agricultural and sideline products to accelerate the progress of agricultural and sideline product processing is of great significance for promoting the sustained development of the agricultural and sideline product procurement movement and for ensuring the needs of the people's livelihood and industrial raw materials for the current and coming year.

The processing of agricultural and sideline products, like the harvesting of agricultural products, is a heavy task that requires a lot of labor, but it is also different from harvesting work. In addition to requiring a certain amount of labor, the processing of agricultural and sideline products also requires considerable machinery and equipment and technology. In this respect, it is more complex and meticulous than harvesting work. If the processing of agricultural products relies solely on increasing labor, it can certainly speed up the processing progress, but the busiest season for processing agricultural and sideline products every year is also the very busy season for the "Three Autumns" production (autumn harvesting, sowing, and plowing). If processing occupies too much labor, it will inevitably affect the "Three Autumns" production. Since the beginning of this year, processing enterprises in various regions have carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements focusing on machine maintenance and equipment reform, and many processing plants with integrated processing lines have emerged, greatly improving the mechanization level of processing enterprises. However, the proportion of these larger processing plants with better technology and equipment in the entire processing industry is still not large, and a considerable number of large processing plants cannot be put into production in the short term or can only be partially put into production. Relying solely on these processing enterprises is far from sufficient to undertake the processing tasks of all agricultural and sideline products. To this end, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of "walking on two legs" and mobilize all aspects of processing power. It is necessary to implement a whole set of methods combining state processing with commune processing, combining on-site processing with appropriate centralized processing, and combining indigenous methods with foreign methods. At the same time, it is necessary to clearly stipulate the principles of focusing on on-site processing, focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises, and focusing on indigenous methods to strive to complete the processing tasks quickly and well.

Fully leveraging the effectiveness of small and medium-sized processing enterprises and indigenous processing tools is of particular importance for accelerating the processing progress of agricultural and sideline products. Because these enterprises and processing machinery are large in number, widely distributed, relatively simple in structure, and easy to promote, the labor-saving effect is also very significant. Yangxin County, Hubei Province, promoted 80,000 ramie stripping machines this year, of which only 80 were power-driven ramie stripping machines, and the rest were all indigenous stripping tools. Utilizing these machines, the county's 72,000 mu of ramie was all stripped in just ten days, shortening the time by more than half compared to previous years. Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, has extensively promoted indigenous processing machinery such as hand-cranked cotton stalk peeling machines and cotton boll peeling machines this year, increasing efficiency by more than ten times compared to manual operation. There are many places that have these simple to manufacture, easy to use, and capable of saving a lot of labor and improving processing efficiency indigenous machinery. As long as we attach importance to it ideologically and, on the basis of doing a good job in ideological work, strengthen organizational leadership, adhere to the principle of "getting started with indigenous methods," fully organize and utilize all available folk processing tools, and widely carry out mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements to continuously reform the original processing machinery, we can greatly improve processing efficiency and save more labor on the existing processing foundation.

Doing a good job in processing agricultural and sideline products is an important aspect of implementing the Party's policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. Party committees at all levels must effectively grasp this work. In accordance with the principle of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, necessary labor and technical forces should be allocated to the agricultural product processing front under the principle of not affecting the "Three Autumns" production. At the same time, according to the harvest situation of agricultural and sideline products, the order of importance and urgency, and the primary and secondary tasks should be distinguished, and the main forces should be concentrated to first complete the main processing procedures, so as to maximize the processing capacity of agricultural and sideline products and ensure that the processing of agricultural and sideline products is carried out in a planned and focused manner. Industrial and commercial departments in various regions should make every effort to provide strong support to the processing of agricultural and sideline products, do a thorough and meticulous job in a series of tasks such as manufacturing, repairing, promoting, innovating various agricultural and sideline product processing machinery, and training technical personnel, so as to strengthen the processing capacity of agricultural and sideline products and ensure that the processing of agricultural and sideline products can be carried out at the fastest speed, and promote the comprehensive victory of this year's agricultural and sideline product procurement work.

    大抓农副产品加工
    随着群众性的农副产品交售运动在全国范围内的深入开展，农副产品加工工作日益迫切地提到议事日程上来了。
    农副产品的初步加工，是农业生产的继续。也是全面完成农副产品收购任务的一个重要环节。农副产品收购工作从收获、加工、交售直到调运，这一系列的过程是一环扣一环，互相影响和互相促进的。在农产品大量收获以后，加工工作能否紧紧跟上来，就成为能否全面、及时地完成农副产品收购任务的一个重要关键了。大量的谷类和油料作物，必须经过初步加工才能提供消费和储存，许多技术作物如棉花、烟叶、麻类等也要经过初步加工减轻重量和缩小体积以后才便于调运出来供应工业部门生产；而许多野生植物如果不经过初步加工处理，就根本不能提供使用；所有这些农副产品在收获以后如果不能及时加工处理，就要大量积压下来，这不仅会直接影响收购进度，同时由于不易保管而可能造成各种损失和浪费。因此，在大量收获的同时，尽一切努力做好农副产品加工工作，以加快农副产品加工的进度，这对于推动农副产品收购运动的持续发展，对于保证当前和今后一年中人民生活和工业原料的需用，都有着十分重要的意义。
    农副产品加工和农产品收获一样，是一项需要付出大量劳动的繁重的工作，但是它又和收获工作有所不同。农副产品加工除了需要一定的劳动力外，还需要相当的机具设备和技术，在这一点上，它又比收获工作复杂、细致得多。农产品加工如果单纯依靠增加劳动力，固然也可以加快加工进度，但是，每年农副产品加工最繁忙的季节，同时也是三秋生产十分繁忙的季节，如果加工占用劳动力过多，就必然要影响三秋生产。今年以来，各地加工企业开展了以机器检修和设备改革为主要内容的技术革新和技术革命运动，出现了许多加工综合一条龙的加工厂，大大提高了加工企业的机械化程度。但是，这些技术、设备条件较好的较大的加工厂在整个加工业中所占的比重还不大，而且有相当一部分大型加工厂在短期内还不能投入生产，或者只能部分地投入生产。如果只靠这些加工企业就远远不足以担负起全部农副产品的加工任务。为此，必须坚决贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，调动各方面的加工力量。要实行国家加工与公社加工相结合；产地加工与适当集中加工相结合；土法加工与洋法加工相结合等一整套办法；同时，明确规定以产地加工为主、中小型为主、土法加工为主等原则，争取又快又好地完成加工任务。
    充分发挥中小型加工企业和土法加工工具的效能，对于加快农副产品加工进度具有特别重要的意义。因为这些企业和加工机具，数量既大，分布又广，构造比较简单，推广也比较容易，节约劳动力的成效也很大。湖北省阳新县今年推广的八万部剥麻机，其中动力剥麻机只八十台，其余全是土法剥制工具。利用这些机具，全县七万二千亩苎麻只花十天工夫即全部剥完，比往年缩短了一半以上的时间。四川简阳县今年大量推广了手摇剥棉秆皮机、剥棉桃机等土制加工机具，比手工操作提高效率十倍以上。像这些制造简单、使用轻便、能够大量节约劳动力和提高加工效率的土法制造的机具，许多地方都有。只要我们从思想上重视它并在做好思想工作的基础上，加强组织领导，坚持土法上马，把一切可以利用的民间加工工具都充分组织和利用起来，并且广泛开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，不断地改革原有的加工机具，我们就能在现有的加工基础上大大提高加工效率和节约更多的劳动力。
    做好农副产品加工工作，这是贯彻党提出的大办农业大办粮食方针的一个重要方面。各级党委必须切实抓好这一工作。本着统筹兼顾，全面安排的原则，在不影响三秋生产的原则下调配必要的劳动力和技术力量到农产品加工战线上来。同时，根据农副产品收获的情况，分别轻重缓急，主次先后，集中主要力量，首先完成主要的加工工序，以便最大限度地发挥农副产品加工能力，使农副产品加工有计划有重点地进行。各地工业和商业部门应当尽一切努力给农副产品加工以大力支援，深入细致地做好各种农副产品加工机具的制造、修理、推广、革新、培训技术人员等一系列的工作，以壮大农副产品加工能力，保证农副产品加工能够以最快的速度进行，促进今年农副产品收购工作的全面胜利。
