Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from New Delhi: Joshi, Secretary of the National Committee Secretariat of the Communist Party of India, published an article in the recent issue of the "New Age" weekly, listing the facts that China has recently reached agreements with Burma, Afghanistan, Nepal and Indonesia to illustrate China's good-neighborly and peaceful foreign policy, and severely refuted the attacks and slanders against China by US imperialism and pro-Western Indian reactionaries.

The article said, "In the Indian newspapers controlled by monopoly capital groups, systematic and consistent slandering of China has become fashionable today. When the myth of 'Chinese aggression' has become very smelly and has no factual basis, the campaign of slander and vilification has turned to ideological aspects, and the latest trick is to say that the Chinese no longer believe in the principle of peaceful coexistence."

The article pointed out, "The key to the problem lies in making a correct and upright judgment: who wants war? Who is working for peace?"

The article pointed out that Premier Zhou Enlai proposed that Asian and Pacific countries sign a treaty of mutual non-aggression and build the region into a nuclear-free zone. This initiative has aroused widespread repercussions among peace-loving people around the world, especially in Asian countries, but this proposal has been rejected by the US government.

After listing the war cries of Dulles, Eisenhower and others, the article said, "Life itself is the most vivid annotation of American policy statements. The illegal and sinful armed interference of the United States in Asia in the affairs of Laos, Vietnam and Korea; in Africa in the Congo; and in Latin America in Cuba is proof of this." On the other hand, "The Chinese government has shown its solidarity with and actually supported the people of Asian, African and Latin American countries who are fighting for their independence, thereby helping to change the past history of slavery and helping to create a new page in the liberation of colonial people and world peace."

The article further compared, "While the United States refuses to accept China's proposals, it is establishing missile bases in Japan, Okinawa and Taiwan. The fearless Chinese government is negotiating and concluding bilateral treaties of friendship and mutual non-aggression with its neighbors, thereby strengthening mutual trust and contributing to peace in Asia."

The article pointed out that although there is nothing in common between monarchical Afghanistan and the People's Republic of China in terms of social and political systems, they have a common desire to defend their national sovereignty and ensure a peaceful environment to develop their economies and people's lives according to their respective needs.

The article stated that Burma, like India, once had border disputes with China, but the Sino-Burmese border issue "is now a thing of the past because the leaders of the two countries have successfully resolved the issue."

The article pointed out, "It may take some time for the truth to shine, but even a series of lies cannot stifle the truth." The article said, "No matter how the Indian reactionaries and pro-Western monopoly capitalists' newspapers play their tricks, truth-seeking and peace-loving Indian citizens will ask themselves and everyone involved: Since Afghanistan, Nepal, Burma and Indonesia can solve their problems and disputes with China, then why shouldn't India, like our other common neighbors with China and all believers in the Five Principles, make repeated efforts until good-neighborly relations are restored?"

    印共书记处书记乔希著文
    赞扬中国的睦邻和平外交政策
    严厉驳斥美帝国主义和印度反动派对中国的诬蔑
    新华社7日讯　新德里消息：印度共产党全国委员会书记处书记乔希在最近一期的“新世纪”周报上发表文章，列举中国最近同缅甸、阿富汗、尼泊尔和印度尼西亚达成协议的事实说明中国的睦邻和平外交政策，严厉驳斥了美帝国主义和亲西方的印度反动派对中国的攻击和诬蔑。
    文章说，“在垄断资本集团控制的印度报刊上，有计划地、一贯地对中国进行诬蔑，已成了今天时髦的事情。当关于
  ‘中国侵略’的神话已经变得很臭，而又毫无事实根据可言时，诽谤诬蔑的宣传运动就转向思想意识方面，最近搞的一套就是胡说什么中国人不再相信和平共处原则。”
    文章指出，“问题的关键所在，是要正确地、正直地判断：谁要战争？谁在为和平而努力？”
    文章指出，周恩来总理建议亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约以及把这个地区建成为没有核武器地区。这个创议在世界各地、特别是亚洲各国热爱和平的人民中引起广泛的反响，但是这一建议却遭到了美国政府的拒绝。
    文章在列举赫脱、艾森豪威尔等人的好战叫嚣后说，“生活本身是对美国的政策声明最生动的注解。美国在亚洲对老挝、越南和朝鲜；在非洲对刚果；在拉丁美洲对古巴事务的非法的、罪恶的武装干涉就是明证。”另一方面，“中国政府表明它声援并在实际上支持为争取自己的独立而斗争的亚非和拉丁美洲各国人民，从而正在帮助改变过去的奴役史，正在帮助创造殖民地人民解放和世界和平的新的史页。”
    文章进一步对比说，“美国一方面拒不接受中国的建议，同时在日本、冲绳和台湾建立导弹基地。无所畏惧的中国政府则同它的各邻国谈判缔结友好和互不侵犯双边条约，从而加强相互信任，并有助于亚洲和平。”
    文章指出，尽管君主制的阿富汗和中华人民共和国之间，在社会与政治制度方面毫无共同之处，但是它们有着共同的愿望，即保卫自己的民族主权、确保和平环境来根据各自的需要发展自己的经济和人民生活。
    文章说到，缅甸同印度一样，也曾经和中国有过边界纠纷，然而中缅边界问题“现在已经成为过去的历史了，因为两国领导人已经成功地解决了这个问题”。
    文章指出，“真理发出光芒可能需要一些时间，但是即使是连篇的谎言也不能扼杀真理”。文章说，“无论印度反动派和亲西方的垄断资本家的报纸怎样施展伎俩，追求真理、爱好和平的印度公民将会问自己和一切有关的人：既然阿富汗、尼泊尔、缅甸和印度尼西亚能够解决它们同中国的问题和纠纷，那么印度为什么不应该像我们同中国的其它共同邻国以及五项原则的所有信奉者那样，一再努力，直到恢复睦邻关系为止呢？”
