Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Tokyo newspapers on the 13th carried articles exposing the increasingly rampant activities of Japanese fascist groups under the protection of the reactionary Japanese authorities.

According to the "Mainichi Shimbun," there are currently 350 fascist groups in Japan, with approximately 30,000 people involved in their activities. They are concentrated on undermining the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," disrupting workers' celebrations of International Labor Day, opposing the "performance rating" system, and hindering the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan.

Kinoshita Hanji, a professor at Tokyo University of Education, published an article in the "Tokyo Shimbun" pointing out that since the formation of the unified organization "New Japan Council" by fascist figures such as Takayama Iwao, Okazaki Eijo, and Yasuoka Masahiro in April of last year, the relationship between Japanese fascist groups and conservative parties has become closer, and their sabotage activities have become more overt.

Kinoshita revealed that Japanese monopoly capitalists and conservative parties provide large amounts of funds to these fascist groups, further fueling their rampant sabotage activities. It is reported that during the period when the Japanese people launched the struggle against the "Security Treaty," Japanese monopoly capitalists and conservative parties allocated around 500 million yen to instigate and assist fascist thugs in carrying out sabotage activities. He pointed out that fascist gangs have effectively become the henchmen of the Conservative Party.

Kinoshita pointed out that the assassination of Asanuma was a carefully planned event. This is because the perpetrator, Yamaguchi Niro, had left the "Greater Japan Patriotic Party" beforehand; also, they chose a seventeen-year-old to commit the crime in an attempt to exploit the law that makes it easier for minors to avoid the death penalty.

    在反动当局支持下
    日本法西斯团体活动猖獗
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：东京许多报纸13日都载文，揭露在日本反动当局卵翼下，日本法西斯团体的活动正日益猖獗。
    据“每日新闻”报道，日本全国目前有三百五十个法西斯团体，进行活动的约有三万人。他们集中地破坏日本人民反对美日“安全条约”的斗争，破坏工人庆祝国际劳动节、反对“勤务评定”制度的活动以及遣送旅日朝侨回国的工作。
    东京教育大学教授木下半治在“东京新闻”上发表文章指出，自从去年4月高山岩男、冈崎英城和安冈正笃等组成法西斯团体的统一组织“新日本协议会”以来，日本法西斯团体和保守政党的关系更加趋于密切，他们的破坏活动进一步表面化起来。
    木下揭露，日本垄断资本家和保守政党把大批资金供给这些法西斯团体，使它们的破坏活动进一步猖獗。有消息说，在日本人民展开反对“安全条约”斗争时期，日本垄断资本家和保守政党曾拿出五亿日元左右，来唆使和帮助法西斯暴徒进行破坏活动。他指出，法西斯暴力团实际上已经成为保守党的打手。
    木下指出，这次刺杀浅沼事件是经过事先周密计划的。因为凶犯山口二矢在事前脱离了“大日本爱国党”；同时他们选择十七岁少年行凶，是企图利用未成年者行凶容易避免被判处死刑的法律。
