Xinhua News Agency, October 16th. The national men's and women's cycling team of the German Democratic Republic held its first friendly competition in China with the Chinese men's and women's cycling team at the Beijing Velodrome today. In the five events held this morning, Chinese athletes participating in international velodrome cycling competitions for the first time won three championships in the women's group, while the visiting team won two first places in the men's group. Chinese athletes set national records in four events.

　　Young Chinese athletes dominated the women's group competition. Chen Guoshan, 24, won the women's 200-meter individual race (flying start), setting a national record of 13.5 seconds (this event has no national record, and the best national result this year was originally 14 seconds). The visiting team's famous athlete Ehrle and China's Xu Shuangcai both achieved 13.7 seconds, sharing second place.

　　The Chinese women's team, composed of Liu Lichun, Xu Shuangcai, Quan Mingshu, and Zhao Xiangfen, also won the women's 2-kilometer team race (standing start pursuit) with a time of 2 minutes and 51.8 seconds, breaking the national record of 3 minutes and 1.9 seconds. The visiting team's time was 2 minutes and 57.8 seconds. In this competition, athletes from both countries started simultaneously from different starting points on both sides of the velodrome, and the competition proceeded as if they were chasing each other. Both teams used the score of the third athlete to reach the finish line (the home team was Quan Mingshu, an 18-year-old Korean athlete, and the visiting team was Klehans, 25 years old) as the team score.

　　Only eight Chinese athletes participated in the women's 1-kilometer individual race (standing start), and the champion was Sai Zhie, with a time of 1 minute and 28.5 seconds.

　　The famous visiting men's athletes performed excellently in the competition. Peter, 21, a two-time All-German Velodrome Champion, won the men's 200-meter individual race (flying start) with a fast sprint, with a time of 11.9 seconds; Simon, a Meritorious Athlete, was second with a time of 12.1 seconds; Chinese athletes Liu Shaohua and Yu Shengtao both achieved 12.3 seconds, setting a national record (this event has no national record, and the original best national result was 12.4 seconds).

　　The visiting men's athletes also won the men's 4-kilometer team race (standing start pursuit) with a time of 5 minutes and 6 seconds; the Chinese team's time was 5 minutes and 19.1 seconds, breaking the national record of 5 minutes and 32.2 seconds.

The first friendly competition between the national men's and women's cycling team of the German Democratic Republic and the Chinese men's and women's cycling team held its last five events this afternoon. In the afternoon's competition, the visiting team athletes, with their skillful cycling techniques and fast "sprints," won all the victories. Chinese athletes again set five national records in the afternoon.

　　In the men's 1-kilometer individual race (standing start), the visiting team's 18-year-old Irmscher won the championship with a time of 1 minute and 14.4 seconds. Meritorious Athlete Gröning and China's 23-year-old athlete Liu Shaohua both achieved 1 minute and 15.2 seconds, sharing second place. Three other athletes from the home team—Sun Shihai, Wang Ping, and Hao Rudian—broke the national record of 1 minute and 18.2 seconds with times of 1 minute and 15.5 seconds, 1 minute and 17.7 seconds, and 1 minute and 18 seconds, respectively.

　　The first place in the men's 500-meter individual race (flying start) was won by Irmscher and Bahrlebe of the visiting team, with times of 31.9 seconds each. Xu Huigen of the Chinese team had the best result, setting a national record of 32.8 seconds in this event (this event has no national record).

　　Chen Guoshan, a 24-year-old female athlete from the Chinese team, also set a national record. She rode the entire course in 36.2 seconds in the women's 500-meter individual race (flying start), and won the second place in this event. The first place was Klehans of the visiting team, with a time of 35.9 seconds. This event is also newly developed in our country this year.

　　The other two events—the women's 3-kilometer and men's 4-kilometer individual races from a standing start—were held for the first time in our country. As a result, Ehrle of the visiting team (with a time of 4 minutes and 21.8 seconds) and Bahrlebe of the visiting team (with a time of 5 minutes and 19.3 seconds) won the championships, respectively. Among the athletes from the home team participating in these two events, Liu Lichun and Han Guangzhi had the best results, with times of 4 minutes and 30.2 seconds and 5 minutes and 24.9 seconds, respectively.
