    New Materials on the Tianjin Massacre

    Recently, I have read some historical records and literary works about the Tianjin Massacre of 1870, but none of them mentioned a major document reflecting the true situation of the case: "The Complete Account of the Tianjin Case in the Gengwu Year of the Tongzhi Reign (1870)."

    The author of "The Complete Account of the Tianjin Case," Zhang Guangzao, was the governor of Tianjin Prefecture at the time. After the massacre, the French consul Fontanier believed he was the instigator and demanded that the Governor-General of Zhili, Zeng Guofan, kill him as an apology. Due to the intense public anger, the Qing government dared not do so, and instead sentenced him to exile in Heilongjiang to "preserve harmony." Ten years later, he printed two volumes of "Northern Border Grass," which he wrote during his exile (including "One Hundred and Twenty Seven-Character Poems on Dragon River Events"), and also made public "The Complete Account of the Tianjin Case" and Woren's "Secret Memorial" (not included in "Collected Works"), attaching them to the end of the book. Presumably because the printed version was thin and not widely circulated, few people knew about it.

    This document describes some of the basic reasons for the Tianjin Massacre. Tracing back to the time after Tianjin became a treaty port, all goods were transported by foreign ships, which led to the decline of the original sea transport business, causing a large number of job losses and arousing hatred among the people. It also recalls that since the opening of the sea ban, imperialists and traitors had engaged in brutal and unreasonable acts. For example, when steamships entered the port and damaged civilian boats, the government dared not investigate. If civilian boats accidentally collided with steamships, the boatmen were immediately arrested, locked in dark cabins, and forced to pay for repairs. Traitors often relied on foreign power to seize women from ordinary people, and if they refused, they would falsely accuse their husbands of being bandits and frame them in every possible way. Local merchants, if they owed debts to foreigners, would be detained by officials and forced to repay them within three days. If foreign merchants owed local accounts, they could not be brought to justice, and the government could not pursue them. As for cases of foreigners riding horses at high speed and trampling on people's lives, they occurred frequently. The article also mentioned that "the Christians in the northeastern part of the city often relied on their power to bully people." All of these, as the author said, meant that "the people's grievances had been accumulating for a long time!"

    "The Account of the Tianjin Case" also describes the events before and after the 1870 Tianjin Massacre in more detail than other books. As long as we carefully distinguish the author's misrepresentation of the people and his protection of his colleagues, we can sort out the following outline: In the spring of that year, incidents of child abduction occurred frequently. In April, people saw more than once that foreigners were carrying small coffins and burying them in the public cemetery in Dongguan. Some were dug out by stray dogs, revealing that each coffin contained several corpses, so "the people of Tianjin were in an uproar." Later, they saw that the government arrested the kidnappers but did not punish them, which further fueled suspicion that these cases were related to the church, so "the county officials dared not investigate." "Public sentiment was surging, and they were about to burn the Catholic church to vent their anger." At this time, the government was also afraid of a major change, so they had no choice but to re-interrogate the kidnappers and execute them, "and public sentiment finally calmed down." However, the confessions of the criminals who were subsequently arrested still implicated people in the church. Therefore, "rumors on the streets were almost unbearable." Under these circumstances, the government deliberately escorted the kidnappers to the church on the morning of May 23 to verify their identities, "intending to use this to dispel public doubts and muddle through the matter."

    However, the search of the church yielded no results, and the crowd gathered outside the church refused to disperse, and the government did not dare to "drive them away." The French consul Fontanier was furious and, along with his servants, ran to the commercial office with knives and guns, broke through two doors, and entered the study, destroying furniture and utensils. Seeing the Minister of Trade Chongqi, he first fired shots to intimidate him, and then shouted and cursed, and the people in the office were afraid to approach him. The crowd that followed witnessed this situation and could no longer bear it, so they beat copper basins to gather people, and the people in various places responded by beating gongs. Later, Fontanier left the office and, as he passed the West Barracks Gate, saw County Magistrate Liu Jie and shot at him, but missed and killed his servant surnamed Gao. The anger of the crowd reached its peak at this time, "arousing public indignation, and everyone's eyes were splitting. They surged forward in a crowd, grabbed Fontanier, and beat him with fists and feet. In less than half an hour, they beat this imposing French consul to death on the roadside. They then took the opportunity to break into the church, set it on fire, and burned down the church, the Ren Ci Tang, and the foreign buildings at the San Cha River Estuary" ("Leisurely Tales," Chapter 47).

    The so-called "foreign buildings at the San Cha River Estuary" here is the famous "Wanghai Lou." According to Wu Dating's "Preface to Poems on Tianjin Events," the schools run by the church were also burned down at the same time. The Qing government could not use such strong popular sentiment. On the contrary, it was "determined to seek peace." Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, and Chonghou returned the captured criminals to the church. They sentenced twenty-five people to punishment without any reason, in accordance with the intentions of imperialism, of whom sixteen were sentenced to death. Prefect Zhang Guangzao and County Magistrate Liu Jie were both sentenced to exile. They also paid France 400,000 taels of silver for military expenses, sent Chonghou to France to apologize, and formulated "Regulations on Religious Affairs" to benefit churches of various countries in China, and so on.

    The tyrannical acts of imperialism and the development of various aspects revealed in "The Complete Account of the Tianjin Case" convincingly confirm the truth elucidated by Chairman Mao: "It was not the importation of Western thought that caused 'turmoil and unrest' but the aggression of imperialism that caused resistance" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume 4, page 1517).

    关于天津教案的新材料
    最近看了一些有关1870年天津教案的历史记载和文学作品，都没有提到反映此案真实情况的一个主要文献：《同治庚午（1870）年津案始末》。
    《津案始末》的作者张光藻，是当时天津府的知府。教案发生后，法国领事丰大业，认为他是指使者，要挟直隶总督曾国藩杀他谢罪。由于群情激愤，清廷不敢这样做，改判他流刑，充军到黑龙江，以“曲全和好”。十年后，他刻印在流放期间写的《北戍草》二卷
  （内收《龙江纪事七绝一百二十首》），也把《津案始末》和倭仁关于此案的“密疏”（《遗集》未收）公开了，附印在书末。大概由于印本薄，流传不广，就很少有人知道。
    这一文献叙述了天津教案所以发生的一些基本原因。回溯到天津从通商以后，百货都用外国轮船装载，原来的海船营业一蹶不振，造成了大批的失业，引起人民的仇恨。还回溯了自从海禁开后，帝国主义者及汉奸便有残暴无理行为，如轮船进口，碰伤民船，官府不敢查究，民船偶碰轮船，就立刻擒拿船户，关到黑舱里，还得赔偿修价。汉奸往往倚靠洋势，霸占平民妇女，不从，就诬指其夫为强盗，百计陷害。本地商人，如欠洋人债项，被拘到官，并限三日必还，洋商欠本处账目，被控也抗不到案，官府不能追究。至于洋人乘马疾驰，践踏人命一类的案件，更时常发生。文中还提到“城东北一带教民，尤多倚势欺人”。这些，都如作者所说：“民心积不能平久矣！”
    对于1870年天津教案发生的前后经过，《津案纪事》叙述得也比其他书详尽。只要把作者曲解人民及回护同官的部分加以斟别，可以疏理出这样一篇梗概。就是这一年春天，时时有小孩被拐骗事件发生。4月，有人不止一次看见洋人抬小棺，埋葬在东关义冢地内，有的被群犬刨出，竟是一棺数尸，于是“津民哗然”。嗣后，又见官厅捉到拐匪，并不惩处，就更怀疑这类案件和教会有关，所以“县官莫敢查究”。“群情汹汹，将烧天主堂以泄愤”。官厅这时也怕发生大变，不得已重行审问，并将拐匪正法，“群情乃始帖然”。那知继续捉到的匪徒，供词仍然牵连教会中人。于是，“街谈巷议，几有刻不能忍之势”。官厅在这样情况下，就故意在5月23日晨，押解拐匪到教堂内查对指认，“其意盖欲借此以释众疑，借以含糊了事”。
    那知查教堂并无结果，聚集在教堂外面的群众不肯散，官厅也不敢“驱逐”。法国领事丰大业大为震怒，和他的仆人各携刀枪，跑到通商衙门，砍破两道门，又进入书房，打毁什物器皿。见到通商大臣崇绮，先是放枪恐吓，接着又叫号怒骂，署中人畏不敢近。一路跟来的群众，目击这样情况，已忍无可忍，就击铜盆聚众，各处人民亦鸣锣相应。后丰大业出署，过西辕门，一眼看见知县刘杰，又对他打枪，没有击中，打死了他的仆人高姓。群众的愤怒，这时已达到了极点，“动了公愤，万眦齐裂，顿时潮涌纷集，一拥而上，把丰大业扯倒，拳脚交下，白挺如雨，不到半刻，竟将这声势赫奕的法领事殴毙道旁。又乘势闯入教堂，放火焚烧，一把火将教堂、仁慈堂、三岔河口洋楼全行烧毁”（《消闲演义》第四十七回）。
    这里所谓“三岔河口洋楼”，就是有名的“望海楼”。据吴大廷《津门纪事诗叙》，教会办的学校，也同时给烧掉了。民气这样的旺盛，清廷竟不能用，相反的，还是“坚意求和”，曾国藩、李鸿章、崇厚等把已捕获的凶犯复送还教会，这禀承帝国主义意旨，毫无理由的判处了二十五个人的罪，其中有十六名死刑，知府张光藻、知县刘杰都判了流刑，又赔偿了法国军费四十万，派崇厚赴法国道歉，制《教务章程》以利各国在华教会，等等。
    《津案始末》所叙述、所透露的这些帝国主义横行不法的残暴行为，以及各方面的情况及其发展，都非常有说服力的证实了毛主席所阐明的一个真理，就是中国革命之所以发生，“不是什么西方思想的输入引起了‘骚动和不安’，而是帝国主义的侵略引起了反抗”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷一五一七页）。
