Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th -- Seoul Dispatch: Today, more than ten thousand people in South Korea held demonstrations to oppose the Chang Myon clique's shielding of Syngman Rhee elements who slaughtered demonstrating masses in April.

At 11:00 a.m., the demonstrating masses surrounded the puppet National Assembly, including young people and students injured in the April demonstrations, families of the deceased, and students from Hanyang University and other schools.

The demonstrators condemned the Chang Myon clique's actions of sheltering Syngman Rhee elements who killed and injured over seven thousand peaceful demonstrators in April through methods of release and suspended sentences. They also demanded the dissolution of the puppet government and the puppet National Assembly.

According to the Tonghwa News Agency, at around 11:00 a.m., a group of demonstrators rushed into the gate of the puppet National Assembly, which was in session. They went up to the speaker's platform, pushed aside the puppet National Assembly Vice-Speaker who was presiding over the meeting, and demanded the dissolution of the National Assembly.

The demonstrators shouted: "What promises did you make during the election campaign?" "How shameless you are!" "Get out of the National Assembly hall!" "We will manage the country!"

Outside the puppet National Assembly building, thousands of people held a sit-in demonstration, condemning the Chang Myon puppet government and the puppet National Assembly for harboring the executioners who suppressed the April demonstrations.

Speaker of the House, Kwak Sang-hoon, was forced to meet with the demonstrating masses, attempting to calm them down. However, the masses stopped him from speaking and shouted: "All 'National Assembly members' get out!"

At the same time, the Chang Myon clique is attempting to suppress the peaceful demonstrators by force. According to the Daehan News Agency, Seoul declared a semi-emergency state today. "The Dongyang News Agency" reported that the puppet police have been ordered to suppress the demonstrators, even at the cost of using tear gas. According to a South Korean radio station, the puppet military police have been mobilized to deal with the demonstrators.

However, the angry masses have been persisting in their struggle. "The Dongyang News Agency" reported this afternoon that the number of demonstrators is continuing to increase.

    反对包庇屠杀学生的凶犯　要求解散傀儡政府和国会
    南朝鲜万人示威冲进傀儡国会
    新华社平壤11日电　汉城消息：今天，南朝鲜一万多人举行示威，反对张勉集团庇护屠杀4月示威群众的李承晚分子。
    上午十一时，示威群众包围了傀儡国会，他们当中有曾在4月示威中受伤的青年和学生、死难者家属以及汉阳大学等学校的学生等。
    示威者谴责张勉集团通过开释和宣判缓刑的办法庇护曾在今年4月打死、打伤七千多个和平示威者的李承晚分子的行动，同时要求解散傀儡政府和傀儡国会。
    据同和通讯社报道，上午十一时左右，一批示威者冲进了正在举行会议的傀儡国会的大门，他们走上了会议讲坛，把正在主持会议的傀儡国会副议长赶在一旁，并要求解散国会。
    示威者高呼：“你们在选举运动期间许下了什么诺言？”“你们多么厚颜无耻！”“滚出国会议事堂！”“我们来管理国家！”
    在傀儡国会议事堂外面，数千人举行了静坐示威，他们谴责张勉傀儡政府和傀儡国会包庇镇压4月示威的刽子手。
    众院议长郭尚勋被迫同示威群众见面，他妄图使群众平静下来。但是，群众制止他讲话，而且高呼：“所有的‘国会议员’滚出去！”
    与此同时，张勉集团正在企图用武力来镇压和平示威者。据大韩通讯社报道，今天汉城宣布处于半紧急状态。“东洋通讯社”报道说，傀儡警察已经奉命镇压示威者，为此甚至不惜使用催泪弹。据南朝鲜电台报道，傀儡宪兵已经被动员起来对付示威者。
    但是，愤怒的群众一直在坚持斗争。“东洋通讯社”今天下午报道，参加示威的群众继续在增加。
