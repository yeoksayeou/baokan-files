Our newspaper, Wuhan, 14th dispatch: The Red Flag Brigade of the Nanhu Branch of the Wuchang People's Commune in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, is a red flag unit in the city that first realized the garden-ization of vegetable plots and promoted a large increase in vegetable production. Entering the brigade's more than 1,200 mu vegetable base, one sees that the land is as flat as a mirror, the soil is as fine as flour, the ditches are like a net, and the crops are planted in continuous swathes, presenting a new scene of garden-ization. On the basis of realizing garden-ization, most of the brigade's vegetable plots have achieved multiple harvests a year and are evergreen in all seasons, with significant increases in both yield per unit area and total output compared to the past. At the same time, the amount of labor used in cultivation, watering, and transportation has also been reduced.

The Red Flag Brigade has 430 households with a population of more than 1,900 people and a cultivated area of 1,563 mu, including 1,268 mu of perennial vegetable land. In the past, these vegetable plots were scattered into more than a thousand small pieces, with many large and small mounds and pits in the middle of the vegetable plots. This not only caused difficulties in field operations and transportation, but also, especially because the area often has more rain in the spring and more drought in the autumn, the drainage and irrigation system was not established. When it rained heavily, there was flooding, and when there was no rain for a few days, there was drought. Whether growing vegetables or grain, it was all "relying on the heavens." In October of last year, when Hubei Province launched the three-governance movement of water management, mountain management, and soil management, the brigade's Party branch, based on the brigade's characteristics of focusing on vegetable production, led the commune members to vigorously carry out garden-ization, filling in dozens of pits and leveling the large and small mounds, turning more than a thousand fragmented vegetable plots into ninety-one plots, each plot ranging from a dozen mu for smaller plots to more than twenty mu for larger plots. Straight roads were built between the plots, and access roads were built in the fields. The brigade built five irrigation points, installed six water pumps, and built ten water diversion canals and twenty-seven drainage ditches along the field roads. The main, branch, and capillary canals are connected to each plot and densely cover the entire area. After the large-scale land leveling, continuous planting of crops, and smooth transportation, the brigade has initially formed a complete drainage and irrigation system, which can basically irrigate by gravity and is free from drought and flood.

Garden-ization has initially demonstrated its superiority in this year's vegetable production. The First Team, which had a lower vegetable yield in the past, has caught up with the high-yield Third Team this year because it did a good job in garden-ization. Many vegetable plots that could only be planted for one season in the past have been freed from the threat of drought and flood and can now be planted all year round and are evergreen in all seasons. The originally high-yield vegetable plots have further increased the multiple cropping index after realizing garden-ization, and the unit yield has also increased. The brigade's vegetable harvest in July this year increased by nearly one time compared to the vegetable yield of 600,000 jin in the same month last year. According to the brigade's experience, the benefits of vegetable plot garden-ization can be summarized as follows: First, implement gravity drainage and irrigation, so there is no fear of drought or flood, turning "relying on the heavens" into "stable and abundant harvests," and also saving a large amount of labor. Second, leveling the land facilitates mechanical cultivation and can greatly improve cultivation efficiency. Third, changing small roads to large roads, changing winding roads to straight roads, and filling pits and digging mounds have expanded the cultivated land by thirty-one mu. Fourth, it is convenient for continuous planting of crops, making sowing, pest control, irrigation, topdressing, weeding, and cultivating improved varieties more convenient, and it is also conducive to implementing specialized management and piece-rate labor systems. Fifth, with smooth roads in all directions, transporting vegetables and fertilizers can be changed from carrying on shoulders to transportation by carts. Sixth, it is convenient for production planning, which is not only conducive to production leadership and management, but also ensures a balanced market supply of vegetable varieties in different seasons. Seventh, it is convenient to increase the multiple cropping index and implement rotation and intercropping, improving land utilization. Eighth, with the above many benefits, the vegetable production increase movement is pushed to a new stage—multiple planting, high yield, and multiple harvests to meet the needs of the national market and people's lives. In addition, due to the labor saved in all aspects after the garden-ization, the brigade has also transferred labor to newly open more than 200 mu of wasteland this year in addition to cultivating the existing cultivated land well. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to launch a vegetable production increase movement centered on garden-ization throughout the suburban areas of the city, learning from and catching up with the Red Flag, so as to push urban and suburban vegetable production to a new stage.

### 红旗大队菜地实现园田化  一年多熟，四季常青，总产单产都有很大提高

    红旗大队菜地实现园田化
    一年多熟，四季常青，总产单产都有很大提高
    本报武汉14日电　湖北省武汉市武昌人民公社南湖分社红旗大队，是全市首先实现菜地园田化、促进蔬菜大增产的一面红旗。走进这个队的一千二百多亩蔬菜基地，看到这里地平如镜，土细如面，沟渠如网，作物连片，呈现出一片实现了园田化的崭新景象。在实现园田化的基础上，全队菜地大都做到了一年多熟、四季常青，单位面积产量和总产较原来都有很大提高；同时在耕作、浇水、运输等方面也节省了用工数量。
    红旗大队有四百三十户，一千九百多人口，耕地面积一千五百六十三亩；其中有常年菜地一千二百六十八亩。过去，这些菜地分散为一千多小块，许多大大小小的土堆和坑壋，横在菜地中间。这样，不仅造成了田间操作和运输上的困难，特别是因为这一带常是春多雨、秋多旱，排灌系统没有建立，一遇大雨就涝，几天无雨就旱，不论种菜和种粮，都是“望天收”。去年10月间，当湖北全省开展了治水、治山、治土的三治运动以后，这个队的党支部根据本队以蔬菜生产为主的特点，领导社员大搞园田化，填平了几十个坑壋，挖平了大小土堆，把一千多块零碎的菜地，平整成九十一个片，每片小的十几亩，大的二十多亩。片与片之间修起了笔直的大路，田间修起了作业道。全队建成五个灌溉点，安装六部抽水机，沿着田间道路修起了十条引水渠，二十七条排水沟；干、支、毛渠串连各片，密布全区。全队经过土地大平整，作物连片种植，运输四通八达，并初步形成一个完整的排灌系统，基本上可以自流灌溉，旱涝无忧。
    园田化在今年的蔬菜生产中，已经初步显示出它的优越性。过去蔬菜产量较低的一小队，由于园田化搞得好，今年的生产已经赶上了高产的三小队。许多过去只能种一季的菜地，摆脱了旱、涝的威胁，现在可以常年种植、四季常青。原来高产的菜地，实现园田化后进一步增加了复种指数，单位产量随之更高了。全队今年7月份蔬菜收获量比去年同月的蔬菜产量六十万斤增加将近一倍。根据这个队的经验，菜地园田化的好处归纳起来大致有以下几点：一、实行自流排灌，旱涝都不怕，由“望天收”变成“稳丰收”，还可节省大批劳动力。二、平整了土地，便于机械耕作，可以大量提高耕作效率。三、小路改大路、弯路改直路和填坑、挖堆，扩大了三十一亩耕地。四、便于作物连片种植，使播种、除虫、灌溉、追肥、除草和培育良种等都更为方便了，也有利于实行专业化管理和定额计件等劳动制度。五、道路四通八达，运菜运肥都可以由肩挑而改成车子运输。六、便于生产计划安排，既有利生产领导管理，又能做到按不同季节蔬菜品种上市均衡。七、便于增产复种指数和实行轮作、套种，提高了土地利用率。八、有上述许多好处，从而把蔬菜增产运动推向一个新阶段——多种高产多收，满足国家市场和人民生活需要。另外，由于搞园田化以后，从各方面都节省了劳动力，这个队除种好现有耕地外，今年又抽调劳动力新开了二百多亩荒地。中共武汉市委已决定在全市郊区掀起一个以学红旗、赶红旗，大搞以园田化为中心的蔬菜增产运动，以便把城郊蔬菜生产推向一个新的阶段。
