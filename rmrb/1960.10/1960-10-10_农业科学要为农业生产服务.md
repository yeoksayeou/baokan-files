Since 1958, under the new situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, China's agricultural science front has achieved extremely brilliant accomplishments. In order to adapt to the requirements of the Great Leap Forward, comprehensive and specialized agricultural scientific research institutions at all levels were rapidly established and improved, and a strong technical force was mobilized to form scientific work teams that went to the mountains and the countryside, closely integrating agricultural scientific research activities with the production struggles of 500 million farmers to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture and animal husbandry, which played a positive role in promoting the great leap forward in agriculture in 1958. After 1959, in order to further comprehensively and systematically create, summarize, and promote the experiences of large-area high yields and small-area high-yield, agricultural scientific research institutions at all levels sent more than one-third of their technical cadres to establish thousands of research base points in rural people's commune production teams, to eat, live, work, and research with farmers, exploring the laws of using the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" to achieve bumper harvests in different regions and on different crops, turning low yields into high yields, and high yields into even higher yields. At the same time, according to the critical period of growth and development of major crops, and the major problems that arose in the high-speed development of agriculture and animal husbandry, technical forces were organized to conduct comprehensive and specialized technical investigations, combining points and areas, to promptly discover problems, conduct on-site summary research, and promote on-site demonstrations. Practice has proven that the various research activities carried out by agricultural scientific research institutions with the current local agricultural production as the center have both promoted agricultural production and enriched and developed agricultural science.

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the guidance of the policy of combining popularization and improvement, current and long-term needs, and general and cutting-edge research, agricultural scientific research institutions have closely grasped the key issues arising from the high-speed development of agriculture and animal husbandry and actively carried out experimental research. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao summarized the excellent traditions of intensive cultivation of Chinese farmers for thousands of years and the new and rich experiences in the Great Leap Forward in agriculture in 1958, and put forward the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" for increasing agricultural production, which pointed out a clear direction and opened up infinitely broad prospects for China's agricultural production and agricultural science. Agricultural scientists have conducted a series of in-depth studies around the "Eight-Point Charter," initially clarifying the internal connections and specific application rules of the "Eight-Point Charter," and found the appropriate density and deep plowing range under the existing cultivation level for major crops in different regions and its theoretical basis, which has greatly guided this year's wheat harvest. In plant physiology, a new theory of population physiology was created. The science of field management has also been raised to a new level, mastering the dialectical law of the unity of opposites between active promotion and appropriate control, laying a scientific foundation for China's high-yield cultivation in theory and practice. The old views on sparse flowers and fruits and alternate bearing in fruit tree cultivation have been negated by the new practice of protecting flowers and fruits for continuous high yields. Rapid seedling cultivation, nursery emergence in the same year, and early fruiting research have also achieved excellent results, making beneficial contributions to the high-speed increase in fruit tree production in China. The mass soil survey and identification movement that began in 1958 has initially completed the survey and identification of 1.6 billion mu of cultivated land nationwide, laying a scientific foundation for the rational utilization of land, the development of large-scale farmland capital construction, and the cultivation of high-yield soils. Through a large number of experimental studies in various regions and the summary of advanced experiences of the masses, effective ways to improve various types of low-yield soils have been found. Breeding work, due to the adoption of the policy of combining professional institutions with mass selection and breeding, has been extremely fruitful. In 1959, a total of more than 1,270 excellent varieties of crops were selected and bred nationwide, more than four times the total number of breeding before liberation for more than 20 years, many of which have been applied in production, and the increase in production is very significant. The mass tool reform movement has created, improved, and promoted hundreds of millions of new-style agricultural tools, which have played a great role in improving labor productivity and operation quality, and are developing in the direction of complete sets. While vigorously grasping tool reform, agricultural machinery research departments, in order to realize the policy of agricultural mechanization proposed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao of "small solutions in four years, medium solutions in seven years, and large solutions in ten years," took the first step and created a variety of agricultural machinery that is suitable for China's intensive cultivation requirements and can significantly improve labor productivity. There have been gratifying creations in deep plowing machinery, seeding machinery, harvesting machinery, and agricultural product processing machinery. Among them, rice transplanters have been widely promoted, and for the first time in the world, the extremely heavy rice transplanting operation has been mechanized. The rope traction machine successfully researched in China in 1958 overcame the technical gap that foreign countries had been unable to overcome for a long time, making a good start for the agricultural mechanization of rice paddies and mountainous areas in China. The research on animal husbandry and veterinary medicine is carried out around the policy of taking pig raising as the lead and comprehensively developing animal husbandry. Feed is the material basis for the development of animal husbandry. In order to meet production requirements, animal husbandry research departments have researched methods of using coarse feed as the main component, using less refined feed, and improving the nutritional value of coarse feed, and expanding feed sources, solving the relevant technical problems of algae and bacterial feed production. In terms of livestock and poultry breeding, feeding, and management, a complete set of experiences and technologies for large-scale feeding, rapid fattening, full fatness, and multiple births have been summarized and studied, so that new high-yield records continue to appear in animal husbandry. The application and research of attenuated vaccines in veterinary medicine has developed rapidly in China, and a variety of highly effective biological drugs have been created, so that diseases such as rinderpest, bovine contagious pleuropneumonia, hog cholera, and swine erysipelas, which once seriously threatened the development of animal husbandry in China, have found methods that can basically be controlled. The research on the prevention and treatment methods of equine glanders, foot-and-mouth disease, brucellosis, and swine enzootic pneumonia has also made great progress. The scientific technology of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine has attracted widespread attention in various places. Research has proven that many folk remedies and acupuncture treatments have high curative effects for a variety of livestock and poultry diseases. In terms of plant protection, economical and effective prevention and treatment methods have been researched for wheat rust, rice blast, corn borer, and potato late blight, which are widely prevalent and cause serious yield reductions, and a variety of highly effective insecticides and fungicides have been trial-produced.

While solving the key problems of current production, the long-term development needs of agricultural production are also taken into account, and high attention is paid to basic theory and the application of the latest achievements of modern science in agriculture. In particular, using the viewpoints and methods of dialectical materialism, the advanced experiences and excellent results of scientific research in China for thousands of years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, have been summarized, and theoretical works of 5 million words such as the cultivation of wheat, rice, cotton, fruit trees, sericulture, and agricultural soil, fertilizers, plant protection, and infectious diseases of livestock have been compiled. These works fully reflect the characteristics of the great leap forward in agricultural production in China and are the concrete embodiment and product of the great leap forward in agricultural science and technology in China.

II

The achievements made by China's agricultural science in the past three years are not accidental. The fundamental reason is that China's agricultural science is developed under the correct leadership of the Party, holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and unswervingly implementing the policy of agricultural science serving agricultural production. However, on these fundamental issues, it has not been smooth sailing on the agricultural science front in the past three years. It was obtained through a serious struggle with bourgeois ideology.

Establishing the Party's absolute leadership and adhering to putting politics in command on the agricultural science front is the fundamental guarantee for the great leap forward in agricultural scientific work. In the field of agricultural science, whether the proletariat leads or the bourgeoisie leads is the most important issue that determines whether China's agricultural science takes the socialist road or the capitalist road. In recent years, the Party has led the vast number of agricultural scientists to oppose the bourgeois ideas of blindly believing in foreign countries, blindly believing in books, blindly believing in authority, clinging to the old and sticking to the old, and criticizing the bourgeois style of being divorced from practice, divorced from production, and divorced from the masses, so that agricultural scientists further realize that scientific research work must adhere to putting politics in command, serving socialist construction, being both red and expert, daring to think and act, closely connecting with reality, and connecting with the proletarian academic thoughts and work style of the masses, occupying a dominant position in the field of agricultural science. However, the struggle between the two roads in agricultural scientific work has not yet come to an end. In 1959, people with right-leaning ideas on the agricultural science front believed that agricultural science could only be done by a few scientists in a cold and quiet way, and mass movements could not be carried out on a large scale. The Party criticized this theory of less, slow, poor, and wasteful, which hindered the continuous leap forward of agricultural science, and launched a vigorous mass movement to study agricultural science, rapidly expanding the scientific team and overfulfilling the research tasks, thus ensuring that agricultural science could move forward at a faster speed and on a larger scale. Through this series of political movements, tremendous and profound changes have taken place in the political ideology of the agricultural science community, the socialist consciousness has been unprecedentedly improved, and a red and expert agricultural science team armed with Mao Zedong Thought has grown up. Practice has proved that the process of great development of agricultural science in the past few years is essentially a process of continuous struggle and continuous victory between the proletarian scientific road and the bourgeois scientific road. In the field of agricultural science, as in other political and economic fields, it is necessary to adhere to the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end. Otherwise, the smooth development of socialist agricultural science in China is fundamentally impossible.

Agricultural science serving agricultural production is the fundamental policy for developing agricultural science in China. This policy is the concretization of the Marxist-Leninist theory of linking theory with practice in agricultural science. On this issue, it has also been opposed by bourgeois scientists. They released all kinds of strange talks and absurd theories, saying that "solving the problems in agricultural production practice is a low-level promotion work and does not belong to the scope of scientific research," "serving agricultural production reduces the quality of research and hinders theoretical research," and so on. They despise practice, go to old literature to find research topics, formulate research plans based on personal interests, and take an indifferent attitude towards the scientific and technical problems existing in production. This tendency is essentially a reflection of the bourgeois intellectuals' thought of "science for science's sake" in agricultural scientific research. If we act according to the opinions of bourgeois experts and do not solve the technical and theoretical problems that arise in the high-speed development of agricultural production, agricultural science will have no purpose, it will stagnate, and it will lose its value. We resolutely criticized this extremely wrong point of view and practice, adhered to the policy of agricultural science serving agricultural production put forward by the Party, and adhered to the Marxist-Leninist principle of linking theory with practice, so that agricultural science has made its due contribution in the continuous leap forward of agricultural production, and has achieved brilliant achievements both in science and technology and in academic theory.

In order to implement this policy, when formulating research plans, we arrange research topics according to production needs, focusing on solving the urgent problems in current production, and improving the level of theoretical research on the basis of summarizing the rich production experience of the masses. For example, in order to quickly turn the high-yield level of small areas into a high-yield level of large areas, and turn the high-yield level of large areas into a social production level, agricultural scientific research institutions at all levels took the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" as the outline, summarized and promoted advanced experience in a timely manner, and carried out mass soil survey and identification movements and large-scale soil improvement work with cultivated land as the main focus in order to explore the law of formation and development of cultivated soil and formulate effective measures to accelerate the improvement of soil fertility. In order to promote the comprehensive development of animal husbandry, a large number of experiments were carried out on the feeding, breeding, and serious epidemics of livestock and poultry. While summarizing, researching, and promoting, it supported agricultural production in a timely manner, and also enriched agricultural science and produced many new theories. Such as breaking the theory of sparse planting and establishing the theory of dense planting; breaking the theory of shallow plowing and establishing the theory of deep plowing; breaking the theory of sparse flowers and fruits and establishing the theory of protecting flowers and fruits; developing the theory of crop population physiology, the theory of field management combining active promotion and appropriate control; and the theory of attenuated vaccine, etc. And in soil science, the active role of human factors in transforming soil was affirmed, and the viewpoint of promoting and controlling the directional development of soil fertility was established. These facts prove without exception that the summary of advanced experience in agricultural production and the solution of scientific and technical problems, after analysis and generalization, rise to theory, and in turn guide agricultural production, and are further improved in practice. Agricultural science in the past few years has been moving forward along this law.

In terms of working methods, we have implemented the combination of professional research and the scientific and technological activities of the broad masses. The production practice of 500 million farmers is the source of agricultural science development. The creation and development of agricultural science are completed with the direct or indirect participation of the peasant masses. Without relying on the initiative and creativity of the masses, only relying on a few experts in agricultural scientific research institutions will make agricultural science become water without a source and a tree without roots, lagging behind the development of the objective situation. Therefore, we emphasize mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, widely carrying out mass scientific and technological activities, universally establishing scientific research organizations in people's communes, creating a situation in which millions of people participate in scientific research. Under this new situation, it is more urgently required that professional research institutions summarize and improve the advanced experiences and inventions of the peasant masses, creatively apply the latest achievements of modern science in combination with the specific conditions of agricultural production in China, and open up broad and more effective ways to increase production for agricultural production. And to quickly popularize science and technology and research results to the masses, and through the test of production practice, make it more perfect, so as to promote the continuous improvement of mass scientific and technological activities. It is obvious that professional research and mass scientific and technological activities are two inseparable components of agricultural science in China. The organic combination of the two, mutual promotion, can make agricultural science in China improve on the basis of popularization, and popularize under the guidance of improvement. Those who only rely on experts and do not want the masses, regard scientific research work as mysterious and unpredictable, and advocate crawling on one leg instead of leaping forward on two legs have been thoroughly bankrupted in the face of facts.

We have also implemented the combination of experimental field research laboratories of research institutions and base points established in people's communes. The characteristic of the experimental research work at the base point is that it is closely related to field production. In the entire process of high-yield cultivation from planting to harvesting, observe, record, and analyze the advanced experiences of the masses, and obtain more complete first-hand scientific data. The experimental field research laboratory grasps a large amount of data from the base point, uses superior technical equipment, verifies, identifies, and improves it through more precise experiments, and raises it to theory. At the same time, under the current conditions, experimental fields and research laboratories should also consider the long-term development needs of agricultural production, conduct exploratory research on cutting-edge projects, and after achieving results, promote and apply them in production through the production tests and demonstrations of base points. Therefore, the combination of experimental field research laboratories and rural base points is also an important method to realize the combination of theory and practice, current and long-term, general and cutting-edge. However, in the past, many scientific workers were bound by the bourgeois academic thoughts of theory being divorced from practice, and could not understand the dialectical relationship between the two, unilaterally emphasizing the work of experimental fields and research laboratories, ignoring field production, and opposing going to the countryside to station at base points. As a result, the summary of advanced experience was generalized, superficial, and one-sided, and the things researched were difficult to promote because they were divorced from production practice, so that the experimental fields and research laboratories could not play the role they should. After years of repeated struggles, this method has been accepted by the majority of agricultural scientists, overcoming this tendency that is not conducive to the great leap forward in agricultural production and agricultural science.

In order to make experimental research produce results as soon as possible and support agricultural production, the one-sided view of avoiding repetition, which in the past ignored actual needs and possibilities and overemphasized avoiding repetition, was criticized in the agricultural science community, and bold innovations were made to break old conventions and create experimental research methods of setting up more base points, exploring in multiple ways, and advancing side by side. The greatest superiority of this method is that it not only gives full play to the scientific and technical strength of research institutions, but also mobilizes the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, achieving the practical results of more, faster, better, and more economical. On the one hand, the two major characteristics of agricultural production, regionality and seasonality, are used to replace time with space, and an experiment is carried out multiple times in different places, accelerating the research process. For example, in the selection and breeding of crop varieties, advantageous conditions such as greenhouses and tropical and subtropical regions and alpine regions are used, multiplying multiple generations a year, and setting up multiple base points to identify, conduct regional trials, and multiply at the same time, which greatly shortens the time for breeding new varieties; on the other hand, due to multiple explorations, more methods to break through the key can be found in a shorter period of time, improve the quality of research, and make the results rich and colorful. In the past two years, the reason why rapid seedling cultivation of fruit trees has been able to achieve great achievements and is widely used in fruit tree production is because five routes of attack, namely grafting, cutting, seed, layering, and dividing, are adopted, and in each route, a result of a hundred flowers blooming and a riot of color has been obtained. Taking cutting as an example, leaf cuttings, bud cuttings, and stem cuttings of citrus, branch cuttings of pomelo trees, single bud and double bud cuttings of grapes, and hardwood cuttings of apples have been created, etc. Adopting this method in agricultural machinery research can not only create various types of machinery, but also, after evaluation and identification, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, and concentrate the advantages of all parties to quickly research more perfect high-level products. The birth process of rice transplanters, ramie stripping machines, and tea picking machines is an extremely obvious example.

III

The brilliant achievements made by China's agricultural science in all aspects in the past three years are a great victory for the socialist construction general line and Mao Zedong Thought on the agricultural science front. Under the new situation of the whole Party and the whole people running agriculture in a big way and running grain in a big way, the tasks facing agricultural scientists in China are glorious and arduous. We must not be satisfied with the existing achievements, we should further study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong's writings, deeply understand Chairman Mao's thought that the development of the national economy must be based on agriculture, work diligently and conscientiously, continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of agricultural science serving agricultural production, go deep into the front line of production, and solve the scientific and technical problems existing in agricultural production more timely and more specifically, improve the level of research, and further strive for the continuous leap forward in agricultural production.

    农业科学要为农业生产服务
    中国农业科学院副院长　程照轩
    1958年以来在农业生产大跃进的新形势下，我国农业科学战线上取得了极其辉煌的成就。为了适应大跃进形势的要求，各级综合性的和专业性的农业科学研究机关迅速建立和健全起来，并且动员了一支雄厚的技术力量，组成科学工作队，上山下乡，将农业科学研究活动和五亿农民争取农牧业大丰收的生产斗争紧密结合起来，对1958年的农业大跃进起了积极的促进作用。1959年以后，为了进一步全面系统地创造、总结和推广大面积丰产和小面积高额丰产经验，各级农业科学研究机关派出了三分之一以上的技术干部，在农村人民公社生产队建立了数以千计的研究基点，与农民同吃、同住、同劳动、同研究，探讨在不同地区和不同作物上运用农业“八字宪法”夺取丰收的规律，使低产变高产，高产更高产。同时，根据各主要作物生长发育的关键时期，和农牧业高速度发展中出现的重大问题，组织技术力量，点面结合，进行综合性和专题性的技术考察，及时发现问题，现场汇综研究，就地示范推广，实践证明，农业科学研究机关以当前当地农业生产为中心开展的各项研究活动，既促进了农业生产，又丰富和发展了农业科学。
    一
    1958年大跃进以来，农业科学研究机关在普及与提高，当前与长远，一般与尖端相结合的方针指导之下，紧紧地抓住了农牧业高速度发展所产生的关键问题，积极开展试验研究。党中央和毛主席总结了我国农民几千年的精耕细作的优良传统和1958年农业大跃进中新的丰富经验，提出了农业增产的“八字宪法”，为我国农业生产和农业科学指出了明确的方向，开辟了无限广阔的前途。农业科学工作者围绕“八字宪法”深入地进行了一系列的研究，初步明确了“八字宪法”的内在联系与具体运用的规律，找到了不同地区主要作物在现有耕作栽培水平下适宜的密植幅度和深耕范围及其理论依据，对今年小麦丰收有很大的指导作用。在植物生理学中，创立了群体生理的新理论。田间管理科学也已提高到一个新的水平，掌握了积极促进和适当控制相结合的矛盾统一的辩证规律，为我国丰产栽培在理论和实践上奠定了科学基础。在果树栽培上的疏花疏果、大年小年的陈旧观点，已被新的保花保果连年丰产的实践所否定。快速育苗、当年出圃、提早结果等研究也都获得优异的成绩，为我国果树高速增产作出了有益的贡献。从1958年开始的群众性的土壤普查鉴定运动，已初步完成了全国十六亿亩耕地的普查鉴定工作，为合理利用土地、开展大规模农田基本建设以及培育高产土壤，奠定了科学基础。通过各地大量的试验研究和群众的先进经验的总结，找到了改良各种类型的低产土壤的有效途径。育种工作由于采取专业机关和群选群育相结合的方针，成果极为丰硕，1959年全国共选育出农作物优良品种一千二百七十余个，超过了解放前二十多年育种总数四倍还多，其中许多已在生产中应用，增产非常显著。群众性的工具改革运动，创造、改进和推广了数以亿计的新式农具，对提高劳动生产率和作业质量起到了很大作用，正向配套成龙的方向发展。农业机械研究部门在大抓工具改革的同时，为了实现党中央和毛主席提出的“四年小解决，七年中解决，十年大解决”的农业机械化的方针，先行一步，创造了多种多样既适合我国农业精耕细作的要求，又能显著提高劳动生产率的农业机械。在深耕机具、播种机具、收获机具、农产品加工机具等方面，都有可喜的创造。其中插秧机已大规模推广，在世界上第一次使极为繁重的水稻插秧作业实现了机械化。1958年我国研究成功的绳索牵引机，在技术上克服了国外长期无法逾越的鸿沟，为我国水田山区的农业机械化作了良好开端。畜牧兽医的研究是围绕以养猪为首、全面发展畜牧业的方针而进行的，饲料又是发展畜牧业的物质基础。畜牧研究部门为了满足生产要求，研究出了以粗饲料为主、少用精料和提高粗饲料营养价值的方法，并扩大饲料来源，解决了藻菌类饲料生产的有关技术问题。在畜禽繁殖、饲养和管理等方面，总结和研究了大群饲养、快速育肥、满膘满怀、多胎多产的成套经验和技术，使畜牧业中不断出现了高产的新纪录。兽医上弱毒苗的应用和研究在我国飞跃发展，创制出多种效率很高的生物药品，使曾经严重威胁我国畜牧业发展的牛瘟、牛肺疫、猪瘟、猪丹毒等疫病，找出了基本能加以控制的方法。马鼻疽、口蹄疫、布氏杆菌病以及猪喘气病的防治方法的研究，也获得很大进展。中兽医的科学技术已引起各地普遍重视，研究证明许多民间验方和针灸疗法对多种畜禽病害具有很高的疗效。植物保护方面，对于广泛流行造成严重减产的小麦锈病、稻瘟病、玉米螟、马铃薯晚疫病等都已经研究出经济有效的防治方法，并试制成功多种高效的杀虫杀菌药剂。
    在解决当前生产关键问题的同时，也兼顾了农业生产长远发展的需要，对基础理论和近代科学最新成就在农业中的应用，都予以高度的注意。特别是运用辩证唯物主义的观点和方法，总结了我国几千年来特别是大跃进以来的先进经验和科学研究的优秀成果，编写出小麦、水稻、棉花、果树、蚕桑栽培学及农业土壤、肥料、植物保护、家畜传染病等五百万字的理论著作，这些著作都充分反映了我国农业生产大跃进的特点，是我国农业科学技术大跃进的具体体现和产物。
    二
    三年来，我国农业科学取得这些成就并不是偶然的，根本原因在于我国的农业科学是在党的正确领导下，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗，坚定不移地贯彻执行农业科学为农业生产服务的方针而发展的。但是，在这些根本性质的问题上，三年来在农业科学战线上不是一帆风顺的，是和资产阶级思想进行了严肃的斗争所获得的。
    在农业科学战线上树立党的绝对领导，坚持政治挂帅，是农业科学工作大跃进的根本保证。在农业科学领域内，由无产阶级来领导，还是由资产阶级来领导，这是决定我国农业科学走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路的头等重要的问题。近几年来，党领导着广大的农业科学工作者反对了迷信外国、迷信书本、迷信权威、抱残守缺、墨守成规的资产阶级思想，批判了脱离实践、脱离生产和脱离群众的资产阶级的作风，使农业科学工作者进一步认识到科学研究工作必须坚持政治挂帅、为社会主义建设服务、又红又专、敢想敢干、密切联系实际、联系群众的无产阶级的学术思想和工作作风，在农业科学领域内居于主导地位。但是，农业科学工作中两条道路的斗争并没有最后结束，1959年，农业科学战线上具有右倾思想的人认为农业科学只能由少数科学家冷冷清清地办，不能大搞群众运动。党批判了这种阻碍农业科学持续跃进的少、慢、差、费的论调，开展了轰轰烈烈的研究农业科学的群众运动，迅速壮大了科学队伍，超额完成了研究任务，从而保证农业科学能以更快的速度更大的规模向前迈进。通过这一系列的政治运动，农业科学界的政治思想发生了巨大而深刻的变化，社会主义觉悟空前提高，一支以毛泽东思想武装起来的又红又专的农业科学队伍成长起来了。实践证明，几年来农业科学大发展的过程实质上是无产阶级的科学道路和资产阶级的科学道路不断进行斗争不断取得胜利的过程，在农业科学领域内，如同在其他政治和经济领域中一样，必须坚持党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，把社会主义革命进行到底，否则，我国社会主义的农业科学的顺利发展是根本不可能的。
    农业科学为农业生产服务是发展我国农业科学的根本方针，这条方针是马克思列宁主义理论联系实践在农业科学中的具体化。在这个问题上也遭到了资产阶级科学家的反对，他们放出各式各样的奇谈怪论，说什么“解决农业生产实践中的问题是低级的推广工作，不属于科学研究的范围”，“为农业生产服务降低研究质量，妨碍理论的研究”，等等。他们轻视实践，到旧文献中去找研究课题，从个人兴趣出发来制订研究计划，对生产中存在的科学技术问题采取了漠不关心的态度。这种倾向实质上是资产阶级知识分子“为科学而科学”的思想在农业科学研究中的反映。如果按照资产阶级专家的意见行事，不去解决农业生产高速度发展中出现的技术问题和理论问题，农业科学便会没有目的性，就会停滞不前，就会失去它存在的价值。我们坚决批判了这种极端错误的观点和作法，坚持了党所提出的农业科学为农业生产服务的方针，坚持了马克思列宁主义理论联系实际的原则，使农业科学在农业生产持续跃进中作出了应有的贡献，不论在科学技术上抑或是在学术理论上都获得了光辉的成就。
    为了贯彻执行这一方针，在制定研究计划时，我们针对生产需要安排研究课题，以解决当前生产中迫切问题为主，在总结群众丰产经验的基础上提高理论研究水平。例如，为了迅速把小面积高额丰产水平变成大面积丰产水平，把大面积丰产水平变成社会性的生产水平，各级农业科学研究机关以农业“八字宪法”为纲，及时总结和推广了先进经验，为了探索耕作土壤形成和发展的规律，制定加速提高土壤肥力的有效措施，开展了群众性的以耕地为主的土壤普查鉴定运动和大规模的土壤改良工作。为了促进畜牧业的全面发展，对家畜家禽的饲养、繁殖及其严重疫病等，进行了大量的试验。一面总结，一面研究，一面推广，及时地支援了农业生产，同时也丰富了农业科学，产生了许多新的理论。如破稀植论，立密植论；破浅耕论，立深耕论；破疏花疏果论，立保花保果论；发展了农作物群体生理学说，积极促进和适当控制相结合的田间管理学说；以及弱毒苗学说等等。并在土壤学中肯定了人为因素对改造土壤的能动作用，确立了促进和控制土壤肥力定向发展的观点。这些事实毫无例外地证明，农业生产中先进经验的总结和科学技术问题的解决，经过分析和概括，上升为理论，反过来又指导农业生产，并在实践中更进一步提高，几年来的农业科学便是依循着这条规律朝前迈进的。
    在工作方法上，我们实行了专业研究与广大群众的科学技术活动相结合。五亿农民的生产实践是农业科学发展的源泉，农业科学的创造和发展都是在农民群众直接或间接参与下完成的，不依靠群众的主动性和创造精神，仅仅仰赖于农业科学研究机关中的少数专家，必将使农业科学成为无源之水，无本之木，落后于客观形势的发展。因此，我们强调发动群众，依靠群众，广泛开展了群众性的科学技术活动，普遍建立了人民公社的科学研究组织，造成千百万人参加科学研究的局面。在这种新形势下，更迫切地要求专业研究机关把农民群众的先进经验和创造发明加以总结和提高，结合我国农业生产的具体情况，创造性地应用近代科学最新成就，为农业生产开辟广泛的更有效的增产途径。并把科学技术和研究成果迅速普及到群众中去，通过生产实践的考验，使之更趋完善，以促进群众性的科学技术活动不断提高。显而易见，专业研究和群众性的科学技术活动是我国农业科学不可分割的两个组成部分，两者有机的结合，相互促进，就能使我国的农业科学在普及的基础上提高，又在提高的指导下普及起来。那些只依靠专家不要群众，把科学研究工作看得神秘莫测，主张一条腿爬行而不要两条腿跃进的种种谰言，在事实的面前彻底地破了产。
    我们还实行了研究机关的试验场研究室和建立在人民公社的基点相结合。基点的试验研究工作的特点是密切联系大田生产，在从种到收的整个丰产栽培过程中，观察、记载和分析群众的先进经验，获得更完备的第一手科学资料。而试验场研究室掌握大量来自基点的资料，利用优越的技术装备，通过更精确的试验，加以验证、鉴别和提高，并使之上升到理论。同时，在目前条件下，试验场和研究室还应该多考虑农业生产长远发展的需要，进行探索性的尖端项目的研究，取得成果后，通过基点的生产考验和示范，再在生产中推广运用。因此，试验场研究室和农村基点相结合，也是实现理论联系实际，当前与长远、一般与尖端相结合的一个重要方法。但是，以前不少科学工作者由于受到理论脱离实际的资产阶级学术思想的束缚，不能理解两者之间的辩证关系，片面强调试验场和研究室的工作，忽视大田生产，反对下乡驻点，结果是先进经验的总结一般化，肤浅片面，而研究出来的东西，又因脱离生产实践，难以推广，以致不能发挥试验场和研究室应起的作用。经过多年来的反复斗争，这一方法才为广大农业科学工作者所接受，克服了这种不利于农业生产和农业科学大跃进的倾向。
    为了使试验研究尽快得出成果，支援农业生产，在农业科学界批判了过去不顾实际需要和可能，过分强调避免重复的片面观点，大胆革新，破除陈规旧套，创造了多设基点，多路探索，齐头并进的试验研究方法。这一方法最大的优越性在于它既充分发挥了研究机关的科学技术力量，又调动了广大群众的积极性和创造性，收到多、快、好、省的实效。一方面利用农业生产具有地域性和季节性的两大特点，以空间代时间，一项试验异地多次进行，加速了研究进程。如农作物的品种选育，采取了利用温室和热带亚热带以及高山地区等有利条件，一年多代繁殖，并多设基点，边鉴定、边作区域试验、边繁殖，使新品种育成的时间大大缩短；另一方面，由于多路探索，就可以在较短时间内找到更多的突破关键的方法，提高研究质量，使成果丰富多采。近两年来，果树快速育苗之所以能够取得很大成就，为果树生产上所广泛应用，就是因为采用接、插、实、压、分株五路进军，而在每一路中又获得了百花齐放、万紫千红的结果。以扦插而言，就创造出来了柑桔的叶插、芽插、条插、柚树枝插，葡萄的单芽双芽扦插和苹果的硬枝扦插，等等。在农业机械研究方面采用这一方法，不但能创造出各种类型的机具，而且经过评比鉴定，取长补短，集中各方面的优点，很快地研究出更为完善的高一级的产品。水稻插秧机、剥麻机和采茶机的诞生过程，就是极其明显的例证。

    三年来，我国农业科学在各个方面所取得的辉煌成就，是社会主义建设总路线和毛泽东思想在农业科学战线上的伟大胜利。在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的新形势下，我国农业科学工作者面临的任务是光荣而又艰巨的，决不能满足于已有的成就，应当进一步学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东著作，深刻体会毛主席关于发展国民经济必须以农业为基础的思想，勤勤恳恳，踏踏实实，继续发扬农业科学为农业生产服务的光荣传统，深入生产第一线，更及时更具体地解决农业生产中存在的科学技术问题，提高研究水平，进一步为农业生产持续跃进而奋斗。
