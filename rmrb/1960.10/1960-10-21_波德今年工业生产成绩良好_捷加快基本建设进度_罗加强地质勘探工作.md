Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 19th: According to reports in the press here, Poland's economic sectors have achieved good production results. Almost all industrial sectors have exceeded their third-quarter production plans. Compared with the same period last year, industrial output value in the first nine months of this year increased by 10.4%, and labor productivity increased by 13%. The fastest-growing sector is the chemical industry, whose output value increased by 19.6% compared with the same period last year. Heavy industry increased by 14.9%, coal mining increased by 5.1%, and steel production increased by 8.5%.

Currently, sugar factories across the country are working hard to produce. Experts estimate that Poland's sugar production this year will reach 1.3 million tons. This will greatly exceed the levels of 1958 and 1959.

Foreign trade turnover in the first three quarters of this year increased by 11% compared with the same period last year, and exports have also increased in recent months.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 18th: The German Democratic Republic's industry achieved good production results in the first eight months of this year, with total industrial output value increasing by 9.5% compared with the same period last year. This was announced in a "press communique" recently published by the Press Bureau of the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic.

In the centrally managed state-owned heavy industrial sectors, mining and foundry production increased by 6.1% compared with the first eight months of last year, heavy machinery manufacturing increased by 10.6%, electrical equipment increased by 18.2%, and the chemical industry increased by 9.6%.

In the first eight months of this year, the total output of steel in the German Democratic Republic reached 2,181,000 tons, an increase of 63,000 tons compared with the same period last year; the total output of pig iron was 1,309,000 tons, an increase of 60,000 tons compared with the same period last year; the total output of cement was 3,250,000 tons, an increase of 25% compared with the same period last year; and electricity increased by 2 billion kilowatt-hours compared with the same period last year.

During this period, woolen fabric production increased by 14.5% compared with the same period last year, and Dedelon silk increased by 21.3%. When analyzing the reasons for the rapid growth of production, the "press communique" said: The key lies in improving labor productivity. In socialist industry, from January 1st to August 31st, labor productivity increased by 8.9% compared with the same period last year.

In August this year, 87% of workers in socialist industrial sectors participated in socialist emulation within factories, and more than 125,000 collectives (with more than 1.6 million workers) participated in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th: Czechoslovakia will complete more than 150 key capital construction projects this year, and by the end of August, 66.5% of the annual capital construction plan had been completed.

This year, Czechoslovakia is constructing more than 800 key capital construction projects, of which more than 150 were started this year.

The total value of capital construction in Czechoslovakia this year has reached 50 billion crowns (Czech currency), an increase of 12.3% compared with last year. These capital construction projects are mainly concentrated on the continued development of fuel, power, metallurgy, and chemical industries, and many newly built projects have high production capacity. For example, in the Ostrava-Karvina coal district, four new mines with a daily output of 5,000 tons of high-quality coking coal are under construction.

"Improving the economic effect of investment and speeding up the progress" – this is the general guideline for capital construction in Czechoslovakia this year. Many projects scheduled to be completed this year have been completed ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest: Romania is strengthening geological prospecting work to establish a reliable raw material base for its rapidly developing industry. During the Six-Year Plan period (1960-1965), the amount of geological prospecting work will increase by 65%-70% compared with the previous six years, and the allocation of funds in this area will also increase by 50% compared with the previous six years.

In the coming years, the focus of Romania's geological prospecting work will be to identify deposits of iron, non-ferrous metals, crude oil, natural gas, coking coal, and power coal.

In order to adapt to the huge development of the steel industry, finding iron ore is the central task of future exploration work. Large-scale detailed exploration will be carried out in Dobruja and the Carpathian Mountains in the future.

In addition to continuing exploration in known and currently exploited oil areas, reconnaissance work will be carried out in the Craiova, Pitești, and Bucharest regions where oil and natural gas have exploration prospects. (Attached picture)

    波德今年工业生产成绩良好
    捷加快基本建设进度　罗加强地质勘探工作
    据新华社华沙19日电　据此间报刊报道，波兰的经济部门生产成绩良好。几乎所有的工业部门都超额完成了第三季度生产计划。与去年同期相比，今年头九个月的工业产值增长了10.4％，劳动生产率提高了13％。发展速度最快的是化学工业，其产值比去年同期增加了19.6％，重工业增加了14.9％，煤矿开采量增加了5.1％，钢材产量增加了8.5％。
    现在，全国的糖厂都在紧张地进行生产。据专家们估计，波兰今年的糖产量将达到一百三十万吨。这将大大超过1958和1959年的水平。
    今年头三个季度对外贸易额比去年同期增长了11％，在最近几个月中，出口额也有所增加。
    新华社柏林18日电　德意志民主共和国的工业在今年头八个月中获得了良好的生产成绩，工业总产值比去年同时期增加了9.5％。这是德意志民主共和国总理新闻局最近发表的“新闻公报”中宣布的。
    在中央管理的国营重工业部门中，采矿和铸造业生产比去年头八个月增长了6.1％，重型机械制造业增长10.6％，电气技术器材增长18.2％，化学工业增长9.6％。
    在今年头八个月中，德意志民主共和国钢的总产量达二百一十八万一千吨，比去年同时期增加了六万三千吨；生铁总产量是一百三十万零九千吨，比去年同时期增加了六万吨；水泥总产量为三百二十五万吨，比去年同时期增长25％；电力比去年同时期增长二十亿度。
    在这期间，毛织品产量比去年同期增长14.5％，德德隆丝——21.3％。“新闻公报”在分析生产迅速增长的原因时说：关键在于提高劳动生产率。在社会主义工业中，从1月1日到8月31日，劳动生产率比去年同期增长了8.9％。
    今年8月，社会主义工业部门的工人有87％参加了厂内的社会主义竞赛，十二万五千多个集体（共一百六十多万名工人）参加了争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛运动。
    据新华社布拉格18日电　捷克斯洛伐克今年将有一百五十多项重点基本建设项目完工，截至8月底为止，全年的基本建设计划已经完成了66.5％。
    今年捷克斯洛伐克施工的重点基本建设工程共有八百多个项目，其中一百五十多项是在今年动工兴建的。
    捷克斯洛伐克今年基本建设的总额达到了五百亿克朗（捷币），比去年增加12.3％。这些基本建设主要集中在继续发展燃料、动力、冶金和化学工业等方面，许多新建的项目都有很高的生产能力。例如，在俄斯特拉发—卡尔维那煤区，四个日产五千吨高质炼焦煤的新矿正在建设中。
    “提高投资的经济效果，加快进度”——这是捷克斯洛伐克今年基本建设的总方针。很多预定在今年竣工的项目都已经提前完成。
    新华社布加勒斯特讯　罗马尼亚正在加强地质勘查工作，为迅速发展的工业建立可靠的原料基地。在六年计划期间（1960—1965年），地质勘查工作量将比前六年增加65％—70％，这方面的拨款也将比前六年增加50％。
    在今后几年中，罗马尼亚地质勘查工作的重点是查明铁、有色金属、原油、天然气、焦煤和动力煤等的矿藏。
    为适应钢铁工业的巨大发展，寻找铁矿是今后勘查工作的中心任务。今后将在多布鲁查和卡尔帕特齐山区进行大规模的详细勘探。
    除了对已知的和正在开采的石油区继续进行勘探外，还将在石油和天然气有开采前途的克拉约发、彼特兹迪和布加勒斯特州进行普查工作。（附图片）
