Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 10th: The Czechoslovak News Agency broadcast today the joint statement issued in 196o by the governments of the German Democratic Republic, the Polish People's Republic, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    In view of the increasing militarist and revanchist activities in West Germany, due to serious concerns for future peace in Europe, and faced with the growing danger of German militarism and revanchism once again gaining ground in West Germany, the governments of the German Democratic Republic, the Polish People's Republic, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic issue the following statement to the peoples and governments of all nations:

    Recent facts provide evidence that the military preparations of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany have entered a dangerous new phase. The characteristics of the activities in this phase are: obtaining weapons of mass destruction at any cost, and deliberately maintaining a revanchist sentiment among the people of West Germany, in order to ideologically prepare for war adventures.

    The government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the command of the Bundeswehr have begun to demand revisions of the Paris Agreements, which impose certain restrictions on the Federal Republic of Germany. At the same time, due to secret agreements already reached with major NATO countries regarding the supply of various rockets to the Bundeswehr, they are now openly demanding, in the form of an ultimatum, to possess all kinds of modern weapons, mainly rockets equipped with nuclear warheads.

    The so-called generals' memorandum, fully endorsed by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany and Chancellor Adenauer himself, puts forward these malicious demands.

    Forcibly conscripting all physically fit people for military service, fully equipping the Bundeswehr with nuclear and rocket weapons and bombers without restriction, establishing a powerful navy without limiting the size and quantity of ships and military equipment, and deploying armed forces and military supply bases and other equipment within the borders of NATO member states far from the borders of the Federal Republic of Germany - this is the comprehensive plan for national militarization outlined in the memorandum of the former Hitlerite generals. In an attempt to implement this plan of the West German militarists, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany openly provokes peace-loving countries striving to reach an agreement on complete and thorough disarmament, which the United Nations has already adopted in principle.

    The Federal Government attempts to conceal its demands to possess weapons of mass destruction for the Bundeswehr by using the excuse of the "communist threat." However, European countries, based on their own experience, recognize the predatory ambitions of German imperialism and see through this argument and the consequences it may lead to.

    The government of the Federal Republic of Germany openly declares that forcibly annexing the German Democratic Republic and partitioning the territories of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union are its main political goals. It disseminates hostile and bellicose propaganda against these countries.

    The Adenauer government is doing everything possible and spending large sums of money to maintain revanchist sentiments among the people of West Germany. Newspapers, radio, television, and film—all propaganda tools—are used for this purpose. In schools, students are being indoctrinated with revanchist poison, and this continues in higher education institutions, universities, factories, and government departments. In West Germany, hundreds of various compatriots' associations, oversight committees, federations, and similar associations regularly hold congresses, mass rallies, and demonstrations under the slogan of restoring the "Greater German Reich" and annexing the territories of Eastern European countries. These organizations, usually led by former prominent Nazis and war criminals, receive active support and funding from the institutions of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany. Some West German ministers even very often personally participate in revanchist gatherings.

    Chancellor Adenauer's speeches, aimed at inciting revanchist sentiment and repeatedly demanding preparations for annexing foreign territories in the East, are well known. Recent talks by Vice-Chancellor Erhard, Minister Merkatz, and Minister Seebohm, making claims on Polish and Czechoslovak territories, have aroused widespread anger and concern. All this shows that Bonn has made revanchism a part of its official state policy.

    The Federal Government knows that world public opinion opposes its conspiracy against the territories of other countries, so it tries from time to time to disguise the aggressive nature of its policy with phrases about "peaceful revision" of German borders. However, this practice has not changed the aforementioned official policy in the slightest. Who can take such claims seriously? Who can they deceive? The government of the Federal Republic of Germany knows very well that the countries whose territories it claims will never agree to any changes in borders that would benefit German militarists, nor will they allow themselves to be drawn into bargaining on this issue. Despite this, it not only stubbornly insists on these demands but also tries to achieve them through accelerated armament. Only one conclusion can be drawn from all these developments: the ruling circles of the Federal Republic of Germany plan to achieve their aggressive goals through force, through armed conflict. As the Bundeswehr grows and strengthens, the activities of West German revanchists have become increasingly unbridled and dangerous. They are no longer satisfied with the "compressed territory of the Federal Republic of Germany" but seek to arbitrarily use West Berlin, located in the heart of the German Democratic Republic, to achieve their provocative goals. The demands shouted by the West German military clique are becoming increasingly provocative and increasingly arrogant. The characteristics of German policy on the eve of World War II are manifested in an increasingly blatant and undisguised manner in the political course followed by the ruling circles of the Federal Republic of Germany. The German rulers of that time also claimed to have "equal" rights in armaments, also shouted about the "communist danger," and similarly poisoned the minds of Germans with revanchist ideas and demanded new "living space." We all know what the outcome was.

    Armed to the teeth, fascist Germany finally dragged humanity into a terrible bloody war, bringing indescribable pain and disaster to the peoples of all countries, including the German people themselves.

    Today, the reason why the revanchists can openly make a comeback, and the reason why German militarism can once again gain ground and threaten the peaceful life of all nations, is due to the shortsighted and dangerous German policy pursued by the ruling circles of the Western Big Three, mainly the United States, in the post-war period. Because it is precisely they who openly violated their solemn obligation, undertaken together with the Soviet Union: they will take all necessary measures to prevent Germany from again becoming a threat to its neighbors or world peace. It is precisely they who eagerly opened the door to forming a military alliance with West German militarists, supporting them in building one of the strongest armies in Western Europe. It is precisely they who, immediately after the conclusion of the Paris Treaties, even began step by step to undermine the minor restrictions imposed on West German rearmament under the terms of these agreements; it was none other than the United States government that insisted in December 1957 on the decision to equip NATO forces, including the Bundeswehr, with modern weapons, thereby creating the foundation for equipping the Federal Republic of Germany with rockets and nuclear weapons. It is precisely the Pentagon that eagerly provides Hitler's generals with strategic rockets like the Polaris missile; these generals are already boasting that the Polaris missile will enable them to maintain very important centers in neighboring countries within the range of such missiles. According to recent announcements, NATO Commander Norstad supports the demand put forward by West German revanchists to allow them to build warships with tonnage sufficient to equip heavy rocket weapons and nuclear warheads.

    It is precisely the support given to the Federal Republic of Germany by Western countries that has created a situation in which the Bundeswehr is increasingly arrogantly demanding to become the main military force in NATO in Europe. The militarists in West Germany are no longer satisfied with the "compressed area of the Federal Republic of Germany" but plan to set up military facilities and troops of the Bundeswehr throughout Europe, tying European countries more firmly to their war machine and subordinating them to the military preparations of the Federal Republic of Germany. The result of this situation is that the current allies of the Federal Republic of Germany may, on the basis of military treaties, be dragged into war at any time against their will, to carry out the evil conspiracies of the West German revanchists.

    The governments of the United States, Britain, and France pretend not to see the scale that the activities of the revanchists have reached in West Germany, and they do not say a word about the shameless demands put forward in the "memorandum of the General Staff." If what is hidden behind all this is an attempt to continue to implement a policy of supporting West German militarism and revanchism, then the aforementioned countries must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences that this policy will inevitably lead to.

    The governments of the United States, Britain, and France, which have military obligations to the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as the governments of other European countries, should remember the fate of those countries that helped Hitler's Germany rearm before World War II, and they should remember the price that the people of those countries had to pay for the criminal Munich policy of their governments.

    It is obvious that the governments of the German Democratic Republic, Poland, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia are strongly raising the issue of the threat to peace posed by West German imperialism not out of fear of West Germany's mad plans. The countries of the socialist camp possess all the forces necessary to crush any aggressor; however, allowing the militarist forces of the Federal Republic of Germany to acquire rockets and nuclear weapons today will mean facing the direct danger that these weapons will be used to realize revanchist plots tomorrow. This will not only cause the destruction of West Germany but will also cause enormous disasters to the rest of the world.

    Today, more than ever, all peace-loving people need to take the most resolute measures to stop the West German revanchists' evil acts of playing with fire.

    To this end, an important step is to conclude peace treaties with the two Germanys. The governments of the German Democratic Republic, the Polish People's Republic ,the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic are ready to conclude such treaties, and they firmly believe that the issue of concluding peace with Germany, including the issue of West Berlin, can be resolved positively; the sooner this is done, the more beneficial it will be to the cause of peace in Europe and to the German people themselves.

    The Government of the German Democratic Republic, the Government of the Polish People's Republic, the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Government of the Czechoslovakia Socialist Republic call on the peoples and governments of all countries, especially the peoples and governments of countries that participated in the war against Hitler's Germany, to work together to prevent the threat to peace from German militarism and revanchism, to prevent the Bundeswehr from being equipped with rockets and nuclear weapons, and to make every effort to strive for the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, thereby ensuring peace and security for all countries in Europe on this basis.

### 德波苏捷政府发表联合声明  揭露西德军国主义在西方庇护下猖狂备战

    德波苏捷政府发表联合声明
    揭露西德军国主义在西方庇护下猖狂备战
    新华社布拉格10日电  捷克斯洛伐克通讯社今天广播了德意志民主共和国、波兰人民共和国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国政府1960年发表的联合声明，声明全文如下：
    鉴于西德军国主义和复仇主义活动的加剧，由于对今后的欧洲和平的严重不安，面对着在西德再一次得势的德国军国主义和复仇主义的日益增长的危险，德意志民主共和国、波兰人民共和国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国政府，向各国人民和政府发表声明如下：
    最近的事实所提供的证据证明，德意志联邦共和国政府的军事准备已进入一个危险的新阶段，这个阶段中的活动的特点是：不惜任何代价获得大规模毁灭性的武器和在西德的人们中间蓄意保持一种复仇主义情绪，为进行战争冒险作好思想准备。
    德意志联邦共和国政府和联邦国防军司令部已开始要求修改对德意志联邦共和国规定某种限制的巴黎协定，同时，由于已经就对联邦国防军供应各种火箭同北大西洋公约组织主要国家达成秘密协议，现在公然以最后通牒的形式要求拥有各种现代化武器，主要是配有原子弹头的火箭。
    德意志联邦共和国政府和阿登纳总理本人充分赞同的所谓的将军们的备忘录，就提出了这种种恶毒的要求。
    强行征募所有体格适于服军役的人，用核武器和火箭武器、轰炸机毫无限制地把联邦国防军全副武装起来，建立强大的海军而对舰只和军事装备的规模和数量不加限制，在距德意志联邦共和国国境很远的北大西洋公约组织成员国的国境内部署武装部队和军事供应基地和其他装备——这就是前希特勒的将领们的备忘录中所概述的国家军事化的全面计划。为了力图执行西德军国主义者的这次计划，德意志联邦共和国政府对努力争取就全面和彻底裁军问题达成协议的爱好和平的国家公然进行挑衅，而全面和彻底裁军是联合国已经在原则上予以通过的。
    联邦政府企图借口“共产主义威胁”来掩盖使联邦国防军拥有大规模毁灭性武器的要求。但是，欧洲国家根据它们自己的经验认清德国帝国主义的掠夺野心，识破这种论调以及它可能导致的后果。
    德意志联邦共和国政府公然声称，强行并吞德意志民主共和国，分割波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和苏联的领土，是它的主要政治目标。它针对这些国家散播敌对的和好战的宣传。
    阿登纳政府正在想尽办法、花大量的金钱在西德人民中间保持复仇主义情绪。报纸、电台、电视和电影——一切宣传工具都用于这个目的。在学校里，开始对学生灌输复仇主义毒素，在高等院校和大学以及工厂和机关里，也继续在这样做。在西德，数以百计的各种各样的同乡会、监察会、联合会和类似的协会，在恢复“大德意志帝国”和合并东欧国家领土的口号下经常举行代表大会、群众大会和示威。照例由以前的著名纳粹分子和战犯领导的这些组织，得到德意志联邦共和国政府机构的积极支持和资助。有些西德部长甚至十分经常地亲自参加复仇主义者的集会。
    阿登纳总理的旨在煽起复仇主义情绪并且一再要求准备并吞东方的外国领土的演说，是人所共知的。艾哈德副总理、麦卡茨部长和塞博姆部长最近发表的对波兰和捷克斯洛伐克领土提出要求的谈话，引起普遍的愤怒和关切。所有这一切表明，波恩已经把复仇主义作为国家的官方政策的一部分。
    联邦政府知道，世界舆论反对它对他国领土的阴谋，因此它不时企图用关于“和平修改”德国疆界问题的辞句来掩饰它的政策的侵略性质。但是，这种做法丝毫没有使上述官方政策有所改变。谁能认真对待这种说法呢？他们能够骗得过谁呢？德意志联邦共和国政府知道得很清楚，它对之提出领土要求的国家，决不答应对疆界作任何改变而有利于德国军国主义分子，也决不允许自己卷入对这个问题进行讨价还价，尽管这样，它不但顽固地坚持这些要求，而且极力企图通过加速武装来实现这些要求。从这一切事态中只能得出一个结论，即：德意志联邦共和国的统治集团图谋通过武力、通过武装冲突来实现他们的侵略目的。由于联邦国防军的成长和加强，西德复仇主义分子的活动已变得日益放肆和危险。他们不再满足于德意志联邦共和国的领土而设法肆意利用位于德意志民主共和国中心的西柏林来达到他们的挑衅目的。西德军事集团所叫嚷的要求，越来越具有挑衅性，越来越蛮横。第二次世界大战前夕德国政策的特征，在德意志联邦共和国统治集团所遵循的政治方针中表现得日益嚣张和露骨。当时的德国统治者也声称要在军备方面拥有“平等”权利，也叫嚷“共产主义危险”，并且同样以复仇主义的思想来毒化德国人的思想和要求新的“生存空间”。其结局如何，是我们大家所知道的。
    武装到牙齿的法西斯德国最后终于把人类卷入一场可怕的血腥战争，为包括德国人民本身在内的各国人民带来难以言状的痛苦和灾祸。
    今天，复仇主义者之所以能又公然卷土重来，德国军国主义之所以能再次得势并威胁各国人民的和平生活，这是由于西方三大国，主要是美国统治集团在战后时期所奉行的目光短浅和危险的对德政策。因为正是它们公然破坏了它们同苏联一道承担的庄严义务：它们将采取一切必要的措施来防止德国再次成为对它的邻邦或世界和平的威胁。正是它们迫不及待地敞开了和西德军国主义者缔结军事联盟的大门，支持西德军国主义者建立西欧最强大的军队之一。正是它们，在巴黎条约一缔结之后，甚至立即开始一步一步地破坏根据这些协定的条款对西德重新武装所加的次要的限制；不是别人而正是美国政府在1957年12月坚持用现代武器装备包括联邦国防军在内的北大西洋公约组织部队的决定，从而为以火箭和原子武器装备德意志联邦共和国创造了基础。正是五角大楼迫不及待地向希特勒的将领们提供像北极星式导弹这样的战略火箭；这些将领已经在吹嘘说，北极星式导弹将使他们能够在这种导弹射程内的邻国保持非常重要的中心。据最近宣布，北大西洋公约组织统帅诺斯塔德支持西德复仇主义者提出的、准许他们建造吨位足以装备重型火箭武器和原子弹头的军舰的要求。
    正是西方国家给予德意志联邦共和国的支持，造成了这样的一种局势：联邦国防军日益气焰逼人地要求在欧洲成为北大西洋公约组织中主要的军事力量。西德的军国主义分子已经不再满足于“德意志联邦共和国的被压缩了的地区”，而是图谋把联邦国防军的军事设施和军队设置在欧洲各地，把欧洲国家更加牢牢地缚在他们的战争机器上，使它们从属于德意志联邦共和国的军事准备。这种局势的结果是：德意志联邦共和国目前的各盟国可能在军事条约的基础上，违反它们的意志随时被拖入战争，来执行西德复仇主义分子的罪恶阴谋。
    美、英、法三国政府装作没有看见复仇主义分子的活动在西德所达到的规模，它们只字不提“总参谋部的备忘录”中所提出的无耻要求。如果隐藏在所有这一切后面的是企图继续执行支持西德军国主义和复仇主义的政策，那么上述各国必须对这种政策必然导致的严重后果承担全部责任。
    同德意志联邦共和国有军事义务联系的美英法三国政府以及其它欧洲国家政府，应该记取在第二次世界大战以前帮助希特勒德国重新武装的那些国家所曾遭遇的命运，应该记取那些国家的人民不得不为他们的政府的罪恶的慕尼黑政策付出的代价。
    显而易见，德意志民主共和国、波兰、苏联和捷克斯洛伐克政府所以强烈提出西德帝国主义威胁和平的问题，并不是由于害怕西德的疯狂计划。社会主义阵营各国拥有粉碎任何侵略者所必需的一切力量；但是，今天听任德意志联邦共和国的军国主义势力获得火箭和核武器，明天就将面临这些武器被用来实现复仇主义图谋的直接危险，这将不仅造成西德的毁灭，并将使世界其他国家蒙受巨大的灾祸。
    所有爱好和平的人民今天比以往任何时候更有必要采取最坚决的措施来制止西德复仇主义者玩火的罪恶勾当。
    为此，一个重要步骤是同两个德国缔结和约。德意志民主共和国、波兰人民共和国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国政府，准备缔结这样的和约，而它们坚信，同德国媾和问题，包括西柏林问题将能得到积极的解决；这件事进行得愈早，对欧洲的和平事业和对德国人民本身也就愈有利。
    德意志民主共和国政府、波兰人民共和国政府、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府和捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国政府呼吁一切国家的人民和政府，首先是曾参加反对希特勒德国的战争的国家的人民和政府，共同努力来防止德国军国主义和复仇主义对和平的威胁，不准联邦国防军配备火箭和核武器，并竭尽一切努力来争取早日缔结对德和约，从而在这个基础上保证欧洲各国的和平和安全。
