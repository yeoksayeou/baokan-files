    Beijing News: The Beixinqiao People's Commune Party Committee in Dongcheng District, Beijing, regards running public canteens well as the central link in arranging the economic life of the masses, grasping it to the end. While strengthening the political and ideological work of cooks and managers, they continuously improve the operation and management of the canteens, striving to make everyone who eats there satisfied.
    "Secretaries go to the canteen, cadres go to the kitchen" is an important measure taken by the commune party committee to strengthen leadership over public canteens. The commune party committee not only regularly discusses and studies canteen work, but also requires relevant commune cadres to go deep into the canteens to eat and work together, solving problems in a timely manner. Jie Xitian, deputy secretary of the party committee, often goes to various canteens to help with work, doing everything from stir-frying dishes to steaming rice, from business management to food hygiene. Once, when he went to the Chunshu Canteen to participate in labor, he found that the blast furnace stove did not have a windbreak, so he immediately found a piece of wrought iron plate from another canteen and installed it, and the stove immediately burned better. The cooks said happily, "The secretary goes to the canteen and takes care of everything, big and small, and really solves problems." The cadres of the commune's living service department not only manage the canteens by assigning areas of responsibility, but also insist on eating in the public canteens with the masses. Some cadres often carry meal tickets and money tickets from several canteens, both squatting at one point and moving around, eating in a relatively fixed canteen, and eating in whichever canteen they are working in, deeply understanding and solving problems. Li Fengqin, the party branch secretary of the commune's canteen system, squatted at the Jiudaowan Public Canteen, and every day when she entered the kitchen, she put on the cooks' work clothes and did everything from cutting vegetables to selling food. While she was working in the canteen, she found that the arrangement of work and rest for the catering service staff was not good enough, so she helped to reasonably adjust the working hours of the catering service staff, so that everyone had work and rest, and the enthusiasm of the masses was brought into play, and work efficiency rapidly improved. At the same time, the cadres went deep into the canteens, seized good experiences, and held on-site meetings in a timely manner to promote them. Since March of this year, the commune has held more than ten on-site meetings to promote advanced cooking techniques such as steaming rice cakes and the experience of running canteens diligently and thriftily.
    The commune party committee implemented the spirit of relying on the masses to run the canteens well, and attached great importance to strengthening the democratic management of the canteens and improving the operation and management system. Democratic management committees or groups have been generally established in more than 40 street canteens throughout the commune, absorbing street activists, representatives of diners, and representatives of nearby non-staple food stores and grain stores to participate. The management committee holds regular meetings to study and check the daily work of the canteen, and continuously improves cooking techniques and business management according to the opinions and requirements of the masses. In order to strengthen management, the commune party committee divided more than 40 street canteens in the entire commune into four areas, established central canteen management organizations according to the regions, strengthened unified management, gave full play to the superiority of the commune's "large scale and high degree of public ownership," and used the advanced to lead the backward, so that each canteen could develop in a balanced manner. After Li Wenying, a cook and accountant, was transferred from the No. 11 Canteen of Wangdafu Hutong to the Daxi Cang Canteen, she allocated staple and non-staple foods well and strengthened cost accounting. The price of food was cheap and delicious, and it was praised by the masses. The number of diners quickly increased from more than 70 to more than 120. Because the canteens are getting better and better, the diners eat well and cleanly, and they are more energetic in their work.
    The majority of those who participate in canteen work are housewives. Continuously improving their political and ideological level is the key to running public canteens well. The commune party committee noticed this problem early and, in view of the ideological situation of the canteen catering service personnel, generally conducted education on who they are working for. Yu Shuzhen, the mother of nine children, realized that her job as a cook was to "cook meals for thousands of families and burn smoke for tens of thousands of households," and felt that her responsibility was great and glorious. She was enthusiastic about running the canteen well and was supported by the masses. The party committee used her as a model and called on everyone to learn from her. Now, the cooks and managers of many canteens regard the canteen as their home and carefully plan and cook meals. Some canteens make full use of the scraps of rice and vegetables, paying attention to saving expenses everywhere.

    书记到食堂干部下伙房加强管理健全制度
    北京北新桥公社食堂越办越好
    本报讯　北京市东城区北新桥人民公社党委把办好公共食堂作为安排群众经济生活的中心环节，一抓到底，在加强对炊事和管理人员的政治思想工作的同时，不断改进食堂的经营管理，努力使入伙的人称心如意。
    “书记到食堂，干部下伙房”，是这个公社党委加强领导公共食堂的一项重要措施。公社党委会不仅定期讨论研究食堂工作，还要求公社有关干部深入食堂同吃同劳动，发现问题及时解决。党委副书记解锡田经常到各食堂帮助工作，从炒菜到蒸饭，从经营管理到饮食卫生的活，无所不干。有一次，他到椿树食堂参加劳动，发现吹风炉灶没有挡风板，马上到另一个食堂找来一块熟铁板给安上，炉灶立即好烧了。炊事员高兴地说：“书记下食堂，大小事一齐抓，真解决问题。”公社生活服务部的干部不仅分片包干管理食堂，还一律坚持到公共食堂同群众一起吃饭。有的干部经常带着几个食堂的饭票和钱票，既蹲点又转面，除在一个食堂比较固定入伙外，到那个食堂工作就在那个食堂吃饭，深入了解和解决问题。公社食堂系统的党支部书记李凤琴到九道湾公共食堂蹲点，每天一进伙房就穿上炊事人员的工作服，切菜、卖饭，什么都干。她在食堂劳动时，发现炊事服务人员劳逸安排不够好，就帮助合理调整了炊事服务人员的劳动时间，做到大家有劳有逸，发挥了群众的积极性，工作效率迅速提高。同时，干部深入食堂抓住好的经验，就及时召开现场会加以推广。从今年三月以来这个公社先后召开了十多次现场会，推广了蒸碗糕等先进炊事技术和精打细算勤俭办好食堂的经营管理经验。
    公社党委贯彻了依靠群众办好食堂的精神，很重视加强食堂的民主管理和健全经营管理制度。全公社的四十多个街道食堂普遍成立了民主管理委员会或小组，吸收街道积极分子、入伙人员代表、附近的副食品商店和粮店代表参加。管理委员会定期开会，研究和检查食堂日常工作，并根据群众的意见和要求，不断改进炊事技术和经营管理。公社党委为加强管理，把全公社四十多个街道食堂划分成四片，按地区成立中心食堂管理机构，加强统一管理，充分发挥公社“一大二公”的优越性，以先进带动后进，使各食堂得到平衡发展。大西仓食堂从王大夫胡同十一号食堂调去炊事员兼会计李文嬴以后，主副食调配得好，还加强成本核算，饭菜售价便宜，又好吃，受到群众的称赞，入伙人数由七十多人迅速增加到一百二十多人。由于食堂越办越好，入伙人员吃得好、吃得干净卫生，就更加精神饱满地投入生产中去。
    参加食堂工作的绝大多数是家庭妇女，不断提高她们的政治思想水平是办好公共食堂的关键。公社党委及早注意到这个问题，针对食堂炊事服务人员的思想情况，普遍进行了为谁劳动的教育。九个孩子的妈妈玉淑贞，认识到自己当炊事员是“煮千家饭，烧万户烟”，感到责任重大而光荣，热心办好食堂，得到群众拥护。党委就以她作标兵，号召大家向她学习。现在，许多食堂的炊事和管理人员都以食堂为家，精打细算做饭菜。有些食堂做到充分利用米菜的下脚料，处处注意节约开支。
