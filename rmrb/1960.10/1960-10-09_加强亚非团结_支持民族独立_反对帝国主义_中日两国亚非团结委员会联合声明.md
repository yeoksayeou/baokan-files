Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Joint Statement of the China Asian-African Solidarity Committee and the Japanese Asian-African Solidarity Committee Delegation visiting China on Strengthening Asian-African Solidarity, Supporting National Independence, and Opposing Imperialist Struggle.

The China Asian-African Solidarity Committee and the Japanese Asian-African Solidarity Committee Delegation visiting China held friendly talks in Beijing. Both sides unanimously believe that the current international situation is unprecedentedly favorable for promoting the struggle of the Asian and African people against imperialism and colonialism and for achieving and safeguarding national independence. Both sides are pleased to point out that in recent years, the national democratic movement of the Asian and African people has developed vigorously, and the friendly unity of the Asian and African people in the common struggle has been further strengthened. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the friendly cooperation and mutual support between the two countries' Asian-African Solidarity Committees in the Asian-African solidarity movement. The China Asian-African Solidarity Committee expressed its support for the direction of the struggle against imperialism and colonialism pointed out by the Fourth Congress of the Japan Asian-African Solidarity Committee. The Japan Asian-African Solidarity Committee expressed its gratitude for the support given by the China Asian-African Solidarity Committee. Both sides are determined to further strengthen cooperation in order to make greater contributions to promoting the friendly unity between the people of China and Japan, to the common struggle of the Asian and African people and the people of the world against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace.

The two sides reached the following consensus on strengthening the Asian-African solidarity movement, supporting national independence, and opposing the common struggle against imperialism:

(1) Both sides reaffirmed that US imperialism, which militarizes Japan, illegally occupies Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, occupies Chinese territory Taiwan by force, and creates a "two Chinas" conspiracy, is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan. US imperialism is engaged in aggression and interference everywhere in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and around the world, and is frantically expanding its armaments and preparing for war. Therefore, it is also the common enemy of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world.

(2) Both sides believe that the Japanese people's nationwide movement against the Japan-US Security Treaty is a great patriotic and just struggle. It has severely hit the US imperialist war conspiracy and aggression plan in Asia, and powerfully encouraged and supported the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other countries in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism, for national independence, democratic freedom, and in defense of world peace. At the same time, a series of anti-US imperialist struggles sweeping across Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other parts of the world have also greatly encouraged and supported the struggle of the Japanese people.

(3) Both sides strongly condemn the US imperialist policy of aggression and war. Both sides believe that driving the aggressive forces of US imperialism out of Asia and Africa, thoroughly eradicating colonialism, and achieving complete national independence are the fundamental tasks of the Asian-African solidarity movement. Only by realizing this fundamental task can the people of Asian and African countries obtain true peace and prosperity. Both sides believe that it is necessary to hold high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, and to make unremitting efforts to uphold and implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, and the declarations and resolutions of the Cairo and Conakry Asian-African People's Solidarity Conferences.

Both sides reiterated: We strongly support the just struggles of the people of Algeria, the people of the Congo, the people of Cuba, the people of Laos, the people of southern Korea, the people of southern Vietnam, and the people of other countries against the aggression and interference of imperialism headed by the United States. Both sides solemnly protested against the US imperialist aggression against the Congo under the banner of the United Nations, and resolutely exposed and opposed the US imperialist conspiracy to use and control the United Nations to promote neo-colonialism in Africa and other regions. Both sides firmly believe that as long as the people of all countries continue to strengthen their unity, heighten their vigilance, expand the united front against imperialism headed by the United States, and persist in the struggle to the end, they will surely be able to finally defeat the forces of imperialism and colonialism, so that the Asian and African people and all oppressed nations and people can achieve true independence and freedom, and that lasting world peace can be guaranteed.

(4) Both sides believe that it is necessary to strengthen the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries for universal disarmament, prohibition of nuclear weapons, elimination of foreign military bases, withdrawal of foreign troops, and easing of international tensions, and resolutely oppose the activities of US imperialism in stepping up nuclear armament, piecing together and expanding aggressive military blocs, and carrying out military provocations and war threats. Both sides unanimously support Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal that countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, including the United States, conclude a treaty of mutual non-aggression and peace, so that this region becomes a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and are determined to work together to promote the realization of this proposal.

(5) Both sides believe that further strengthening the friendly unity between the people of China and Japan is not only conducive to the common struggle of the two peoples, but also conducive to strengthening the unity of the people of Asian and African countries and maintaining peace in the Asian-African region and the world. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to continue to struggle against the forces that are hostile to China and obstruct the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. Both sides welcome mutual visits between people's organizations of China and Japan and cultural exchanges between the people of the two countries. Both sides believe that the three political principles and the three trade principles put forward by the Chinese government are the only way to open up Sino-Japanese relations. Both sides are determined to work together in accordance with these principles to develop economic exchanges between the people of the two countries and strive for the early restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

    新华社8日讯　中国亚非团结委员会和日本亚非团结委员会访华代表团关于加强亚非团结、支持民族独立、反对帝国主义斗争的联合声明
    中国亚非团结委员会和日本亚非团结委员会访华代表团，在北京举行了友好的会谈。双方一致认为，目前国际形势，对于推进亚非人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立的斗争，空前有利。双方高兴地指出，近几年来，亚非人民的民族民主运动，有了蓬勃的发展，亚非人民在共同斗争中的友好团结，有了进一步的加强。双方对两国亚非团结委员会，在亚非团结运动中的友好合作和互相支持，表示满意。中国亚非团结委员会对于日本亚非团结委员会第四次大会所指出的反对帝国主义、殖民主义的斗争方向，表示支持。日本亚非团结委员会对于中国亚非团结委员会给予的支持，表示感谢。双方决心进一步加强合作，以便对促进中日两国人民的友好团结，对亚非人民和全世界人民反对帝国主义的侵略和保卫世界和平的共同斗争，作出更大的贡献。
    双方就加强亚非团结运动、支持民族独立和反对帝国主义的共同斗争问题，取得如下一致意见：
    （一）双方再次确认，使日本军事基地化和非法占领冲绳、小笠原群岛，用武力占领中国领土台湾、制造“两个中国”阴谋的美帝国主义，是中日两国人民的共同敌人。美帝国主义在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲以及世界各地到处进行侵略和干涉，并且疯狂地扩军备战，因此，它也是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界人民的共同敌人。
    （二）双方认为，日本人民反对日美安全条约的全民性运动，是一个伟大的爱国正义斗争，它严重地打击了美帝国主义在亚洲的战争阴谋和侵略计划，有力地鼓舞和支持了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲及世界各国人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立、民主自由和保卫世界和平的斗争。同时，席卷亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界其他地区一系列反对美帝国主义的斗争怒潮，也大大鼓舞和支持了日本人民的斗争。
      （三）双方强烈谴责美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。双方认为，把美帝国主义的侵略势力从亚洲、非洲驱逐出去，彻底肃清殖民主义，取得完全的民族独立，是亚非人民团结运动的根本任务。只有实现这一根本任务，亚非各国人民才有可能得到真正的和平和繁荣。双方认为，必须高举反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的旗帜，为维护和贯彻和平共处五项原则、万隆会议十项原则和开罗、科纳克里两次亚非人民团结大会的宣言和各项决议，而进行坚持不懈的努力。
    双方重申：大力支持阿尔及利亚人民、刚果人民、古巴人民、老挝人民、朝鲜南部人民、越南南部人民和其他各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略和干涉的正义斗争。双方严正抗议美帝国主义在联合国的旗帜下对刚果的侵略行为，坚决揭露和反对美帝国主义企图利用和控制联合国在非洲和其他地区推行新殖民主义的阴谋。双方深信，只要各国人民不断地加强团结，提高警惕，扩大反对以美国为首的帝国主义的统一战线，并且坚持斗争到底，就一定能够最后战胜帝国主义、殖民主义势力，从而使亚非人民和一切被压迫的民族和人民，获得真正的独立和自由，使世界的持久和平得到保障。
    （四）双方认为，必须加强亚非各国人民要求普遍裁军、禁止核武器、取消外国军事基地、撤退外国驻军和缓和国际紧张局势的斗争，坚决反对美帝国主义加紧核武装、拼凑和扩大侵略性军事集团、进行军事挑衅和战争威胁的活动。双方一致拥护周恩来总理关于亚洲及太平洋沿岸地区国家包括美国在内，缔结一个互不侵犯的和平公约，使这个地区成为无核子武器地区的倡议，并且决心为促使这一倡议的实现而共同努力。
      （五）双方认为，进一步加强中日两国人民的友好团结，不仅有利于两国人民的共同斗争，而且有利于加强亚非各国人民的团结和维护亚非地区和世界的和平。为了实现这一目的，必须继续同敌视中国和阻挠中日关系正常化的势力进行斗争。双方欢迎中日两国人民团体之间的互相访问和两国人民间的文化交流。双方认为，中国政府所提出的政治三原则和贸易三原则是打开中日关系的唯一途径。双方决心根据这些原则为发展两国人民间的经济交流和争取早日恢复两国邦交而共同努力。
