    Accelerate the Training of New Workers Who are Both Red and Expert
    Yingcheng Coal Mine Strengthens Political and Technical Education for New Workers, Ensuring Sustained Growth in Coal Production

    (Our newspaper Changchun, 12th dispatch) In the midst of the increase production and practice economy movement, Yingcheng Coal Mine in Jilin Province has rapidly raised the ideological awareness and technical level of its new workers, resulting in a sustained and substantial increase in the mine's coal production. The output of raw coal in September increased by 11.5% compared with August, and the footage of tunneling increased by 13%. The average daily output in the first week of October increased by eighty-eight tons compared with the average daily output in September.

    Since 1958, with the rapid development of coal production, the number of new workers in this mine has increased year by year. At present, new workers account for more than 70% of the total number of workers in the mine. The vast majority of these new workers come from the countryside. They have been educated through the agricultural cooperation and people's commune movements, and their collectivist ideas have been continuously strengthened. However, compared with the old workers, their organization and discipline still need to be further strengthened and improved. At the same time, since coal mining is a multi-work type of technical operation, and with fewer old workers, it is also required that the vast number of new workers rapidly improve their technical level. Therefore, educating and improving new workers has become an urgent task for this mine to achieve a greater leap forward in coal production.

    After two years of education and training, the political and ideological awareness of these new workers has been continuously improved, and they have played a huge role in the continuous great leap forward in 1958 and 1959. In this increase production and practice economy movement, the mine's Party committee has further strengthened and rectified the work of labor discipline through mass self-education movements, making the vast number of new workers generally realize that only by conscientiously learning the high degree of organization and discipline of the old workers can they better complete the new tasks assigned by the Party. On the basis of the enhanced political and ideological awareness of the vast number of new workers, a heated emulation drive was launched. Zhang Guoxing (a new worker), the deputy leader of the 701 coal mining team, and Liu Shaogui, the team leader, mobilized all the new workers in the team to carry out interlocking competitions with task setting, location setting, and time setting between upper and lower work types and individuals. Since September, they have been over-producing every day. Under the leadership of this group, the production level of the other three groups has also been increasing day by day, enabling the entire coal mining team to over-produce 653 tons of raw coal in the first and middle ten days of September, an increase of 66% compared with the same period in August. Sun Fushou (a new worker) team of the 705 coal mining team, due to learning the interlocking competition experience of Zhang Guoxing team of the 701 team, also achieved over-production every day. During the movement, the sense of responsibility as masters of the new workers was greatly strengthened. When the team leader of the 302 coal mining team was on vacation, the new worker Zhang Xingyu took the initiative to lead all the new workers in the team to work, and as a result, the shift plan was overfulfilled by 34%.

    In order to play a greater role in the increase production and practice economy movement, the vast number of new workers also launched a new upsurge in learning technology. Zhang Changfu, a new worker from the No. 8 well youth tunneling team, with the spirit of learning if he doesn’t understand and learning until he understands, arrives at the wellhead early every day to learn coal mining techniques from the old workers. In less than three months, he learned coal mining techniques such as drilling holes and setting up sheds. These new workers not only humbly learn technology from the old workers, but also carry out mutual teaching and mutual learning. Pan Xingyuan, the team leader of the 501 coal mining team of the No. 5 well, who was promoted from a new worker, patiently taught Xu Guangshou, a new worker, the skills he had learned after he became a skilled carpenter. In the process of training and educating new workers, the role of the old workers is even more prominent. The tunneling section of the No. 1 well adopted the method of signing master-apprentice contracts. Each old worker is responsible for teaching two new workers. In less than eight months, more than 80 of the 100 new workers in the section have mastered tunneling techniques. Due to the patient teaching of the old workers and the modest learning of the new workers, and the mutual teaching and mutual learning between the new workers, more than 70% of the new workers in the mine have been able to work independently.

    加速培养又红又专的新工人
    营城煤矿加强新工人的政治技术教育，保证了煤炭产量持续增长
    本报长春12日电　吉林省营城煤矿在增产节约运动中，迅速提高新工人的思想觉悟和技术水平，使全矿煤炭产量持续大幅度上升。9月份原煤产量比8月份增长了11.5％，掘进延米提高13％。10月份第一周的平均日产量比9月份平均日产量提高了八十八吨。
    1958年以来，这个矿随着煤炭生产的飞跃发展，新工人逐年增加，目前新工人占全矿工人总数70％以上。这些新工人，绝大部分来自农村，他们经过农业合作化和人民公社化运动的教育，集体主义观念不断加强，但是同老工人相比，组织性和纪律性还需要进一步锻炼和提高，同时由于煤矿是多工种技术作业，在老工人少的情况下，也要求广大新工人迅速提高技术水平。因此教育和提高新工人就成为这个矿煤炭生产实现更大跃进的迫切任务。
    这些新工人经过两年的教育和锻炼，政治思想觉悟不断提高，在1958和1959年持续大跃进中，发挥了巨大作用。在这次增产节约运动中，矿党委又通过群众性的自我教育运动，进一步加强和整顿了劳动纪律工作，使广大新工人普遍认识到，只有认真学习老工人的高度组织性和纪律性，才能更好的完成党交给的新任务。在广大新工人政治思想觉悟提高的基础上，开展了热火朝天的对手赛。七○一采煤队副组长张国兴（新工人）和组长刘绍贵发动全组新工人开展上下工种和个人之间的定任务、定地点、定时间的衔接竞赛，9月以来天天超产。在这个小组带动下，其他三个小组的生产水平也日日上升，使整个采煤队在9月上中旬超产原煤六百五十三吨，比8月同时期增长了66％。七○五采煤队的孙福寿（新工人）小组由于学习了七○一队张国兴小组的衔接赛经验，也实现了天天超产。运动中新工人主人翁的责任感大大加强。三○二采煤队新工人张兴余在组长公休时，主动带领全组新工人进行作业，结果超额34％完成了班计划。
    广大新工人为了在增产节约运动中发挥更大作用，还掀起了学习技术的新高潮。八井青年掘进队新工人张长富，本着不懂就学、学通为止的精神，每天都早到井口向老工人学习采煤技术，不到三个月的时间，他就学会了打眼、棚棚子等采煤技术。这些新工人不仅虚心向老工人学习技术，还开展了互教互学。五井五○一采煤队由新工人提升的组长潘兴元，在自己成了熟练木匠以后，又把学来的本领耐心的传授给新工人徐广绶。在培养和教育新工人的过程中，老工人的作用更为突出。一井掘进段采取签订师徒合同的办法，每个老工人都包教两名新工人，不到八个月的时间，全段一百名新工人已有八十多名掌握了掘进技术。由于老工人耐心教新工人虚心学，和新工人之间开展互教互学，全矿70％以上的新工人已经能够独立进行工作。
