    The nationwide procurement of agricultural products is increasingly entering a busy phase. In most areas, autumn crops are being harvested intensively, and the climax of agricultural product procurement is arriving with the concentrated harvest of major crops. For the whole year, the distribution and procurement of agricultural products mainly takes place in autumn and early winter; arrangements for the people's livelihood, light industrial raw materials, and export goods of agricultural and sideline products for the year are mostly determined during this period. In this sense, it can be said that "the plan for the year lies in autumn and winter." And the agricultural product procurement work in autumn and winter is mainly determined in the next month or two. Therefore, now is the most important time for the procurement of agricultural products. At this time, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued instructions on vigorously promoting autumn agricultural product procurement, further raising the importance attached to procurement work by the whole Party and the people of the whole country, and further pointing out the current policies and measures. Party committees at all levels across the country, all personnel of rural people's communes, and all relevant departments and units should deeply understand the spirit of these instructions, immediately take action, organize and promote the high tide of the agricultural product procurement movement centered on grain, cotton, and oil, and strive for a complete victory in the procurement work.
    In our country, the procurement of agricultural products embodies the mutual support between workers and peasants and the close integration of industry and agriculture under the socialist system. Doing this work well has significant economic and political significance. Rural people's communes, production teams, and members sell agricultural products to the state, and the state then has the necessary material strength to arrange for the needs of the people nationwide for food and clothing, arrange for the market, develop industry, support agriculture, and carry out construction. At the same time, rural people's communes and production teams can exchange agricultural products for agricultural production materials, pay wages to members, and ensure that everyone receives the cash income they deserve. This is of great benefit to the state, the collective, and the individual. In addition, people in bumper harvest areas actively selling agricultural products also have the significance of supporting disaster areas. Many bumper harvest areas this year have also suffered from disasters in the past and received support from the people in the bumper harvest areas at that time. In the future, they may also need support from others due to disasters. It is very appropriate to promote the spirit of sharing weal and woe and helping disaster areas now. Although many people already know all these principles, we should still repeatedly publicize them so that every household knows them. So that every rural people's commune, every production team, and every farmer regards the sale of agricultural products as their glorious and unshirkable responsibility to support national construction, support industrial development, support the needs of other regions, and support the people in disaster areas.
    In the high tide of agricultural product procurement, it is necessary to properly arrange and organize the labor force needed for crop harvesting, delivery, processing, and transportation. This is an extremely important condition for completing the procurement task. The harvesting of agricultural products is several inseparable links in a chain with procurement, processing, and transportation, which must be completed in one go without interruption. Harvesting is also a prerequisite for procurement. Therefore, it is necessary to allocate the necessary number of laborers to ensure timely harvesting, careful harvesting and threshing, repeated harvesting and threshing, clean fields and threshing grounds, and grains stored in granaries. At the same time, labor required for procurement, processing, and transportation must be planned and used economically. Saving labor is saving material wealth. Many places have experience in organizing labor: it is necessary to combine the regular activities of professional teams with the necessary shock activities of the broad masses; it is necessary to combine in-depth political mobilization with reasonable work evaluation and material rewards. For example, some places have adopted the method of organizing a certain number of people into professional teams in the picking, transportation, processing, and storage of cotton, and implementing a "package deal to the end" for each link of agricultural crops from picking to storage. When necessary, mobilize the masses outside the professional team to participate in the shock picking. At the same time, they also reasonably stipulated the quotas for various labors, and evaluated and recorded points according to the completion of the quotas, and rewarded those who exceeded the quotas. Facts have proved that this is an effective way to save labor and improve work efficiency. All localities should carefully summarize and promote such methods.
    Agricultural product procurement work must have both centralized leadership and a unified management system, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and initiative of organizations at all levels and the broad masses. It is necessary to mobilize the masses and rely on the masses to do a good job in various business aspects of agricultural product procurement, so that business work closely follows the development of the movement. In this regard, various places have also created many good experiences recently. For example, in the procurement of grain, many places have implemented a close combination of production teams (basic accounting units) under the unified leadership of production teams, production brigades, and commune members. All collectively owned grain is weighed and put into storage after harvest to verify the yield; and the state procurement agencies and commune production teams are combined, relying on the strength of production brigades, production teams, and the broad masses of commune members to do a good job in various procurement business work in a timely and effective manner. These practices and experiences should be actively and universally promoted in the current procurement work.
    At present, the situation on the agricultural product procurement front is very good. Under the guidance of the general line, the broad masses of cadres and people across the country have unprecedentedly improved their ideological awareness; the strength of the people's communes has been increasingly consolidated and strengthened, and they have accumulated rich experience in procurement work; the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel has been winning victories one after another, and the movement to vigorously develop agriculture and grain is progressing step by step. All these are very favorable conditions for doing a good job in agricultural product procurement. The whole Party and the people of the whole country must resolutely implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Party committees and people's committees at all levels must be good at grasping production with one hand and life with the other, and must attach great importance to agricultural product procurement and the arrangement of people's lives. We should make full use of the current favorable conditions in all aspects, and we will surely be able to overcome some temporary difficulties existing in the current practical work, and achieve a complete victory in the procurement of agricultural products!

### 保证农产品收购工作全面胜利

    保证农产品收购工作全面胜利
    全国范围的农产品收购工作，越来越进入了繁忙的阶段。大多数地区的大秋作物正在紧张地收割，农产品收购的高潮，随着主要作物的集中收获，正在到来。从全年来说，农产品的分配和收购，主要是在秋季和冬初；一年人民生活的安排，轻工业原料的安排，农副产品出口物资的安排，大部分要在这个时期决定。在这个意义上，可以说“一年之计在于秋冬”。而秋冬的农产品收购工作，又主要决定于今后一个月到两个月。所以，目前正是农产品收购的最重要的时机。党中央和国务院在这个时候，发布关于大搞秋季农产品收购的指示，进一步提起全党和全国人民对收购工作的重视，进一步指出当前的方针和措施，全国各级党委、所有农村人民公社的人员，所有的有关部门和单位，都应该深切地体会这个指示的精神，立即行动起来，组织和推动以粮棉油为中心的农产品收购运动的高潮，争取收购工作的全面胜利。
    在我们国家里，农产品收购工作体现着社会主义制度下工人和农民的相互支援、工业和农业的密切结合。做好这个工作，具有重大的经济意义和政治意义。农村人民公社、生产队和社员把农产品交售给国家，国家才有必要的物资力量安排全国人民的吃和穿的需要，安排市场，发展工业，支援农业，进行建设。同时，农村人民公社和生产队出售了农产品就可以换回农业生产资料，发给社员工资，保证每个人应得的现金收入。对国家、对集体、对个人，都有很大好处。此外，丰收地区的人民踊跃交售农产品，还有支援灾区的意义。今年的许多丰收区，过去也曾经遭到过灾害，受到当时丰收地区人民的支援，将来也还可能因为受灾而需要别人支援，现在发扬同舟共济的精神，帮助灾区，是很应该的。所有这些道理，虽然是很多人已经知道了的，但是我们仍然应当反复地宣传，做到家喻户晓。使每一个农村人民公社，每一个生产队、每一个农民，把出售农产品这件事当作自己支援国家建设、支援工业发展、支援其他地区需要、支援灾区人民的光荣的义不容辞的责任。
    在农产品收购的高潮中，必须很好地安排和组织农作物收获、交售、加工和运送所需要的劳动力。这是完成收购任务的一个极为重要的条件。农产品的收获同收购、加工、运送，是一条链子的几个不可分离的环节，须要一气呵成，不能中断。收获又是收购的前提。因此，必须调配必要数量的劳动力，保证及时收获，精收细打，复收复打，地光场净，颗粒归仓。同时对收购、加工和运送所需要的劳力，要有计划地安排和节约地使用。节约劳力就是节约物质财富。许多地方组织劳动力的经验是：要把专业队的经常活动同广大群众的必要的突击活动结合起来；要把深入的政治动员同合理的评工记分和物质奖励结合起来。比如，有些地方在棉花的收摘、运输、加工、入库当中，采取了由一定数量的人员组织成专业队伍，对农作物从收摘到入库的各个环节，实行“一包到底”的办法，在必要的时候发动专业队以外的群众参加突击采摘。同时，又合理地规定了各种劳动的定额，按照完成定额的情况评工记分，超额奖励。事实证明：这是节约劳动力、提高工作效率的一项有效办法。诸如此类的办法，各地都应当很好地总结和推广。
    农产品收购工作，既要有集中领导和统一的管理制度，又要充分发挥各级组织和广大群众的积极性和主动性。要发动群众和依靠群众，做好农产品收购的各项业务工作，使业务工作紧紧跟上运动的发展。在这方面最近各地也创造了不少的好的经验。例如在粮食的收购方面，许多地方实行了在生产队（基本核算单位）的统一领导下，由生产队、生产小队和社员群众三方面密切结合，对集体所有的粮食，在收获下来以后，全部过秤入库，核实产量；并且把国家收购机构和公社生产队结合起来，依靠生产大队、生产小队和广大社员群众的力量，及时地有效地做好各项收购业务工作。这些做法和经验都应当在当前收购工作中积极地普遍地加以推广。
    目前农产品收购战线上的形势很好。广大干部和全国人民在总路线的指引下思想觉悟空前提高；人民公社的力量日益巩固和壮大，并在收购工作中积累了丰富的经验；以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动节节胜利，大办农业、大办粮食的运动正在步步前进。所有这些都是做好农产品收购工作的十分有利的条件。全党和全国人民要坚决执行党中央和国务院的指示，各级党委和人民委员会要善于一手抓生产，一手抓生活，要十分重视农产品收购和人民生活安排。我们应该把当前各方面的有利条件充分运用起来，就一定能够克服当前实际工作中存在的一些暂时困难，使农产品收购工作获得全面的胜利！
