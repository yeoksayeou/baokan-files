Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Ministry of Culture, the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, held a grand opening ceremony this afternoon in the Great Hall of the People for the Burmese Cultural Delegation's performance in China. On the double joyous occasion of celebrating the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the official signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, the performance of the Burmese Cultural Delegation added even more to the atmosphere of joy and friendship in the capital.

    Premier Zhou Enlai, Prime Minister U Nu, and General Ne Win attended today's opening ceremony. As they entered the venue, the Great Hall of the People was brightly lit, and the entire audience stood up, erupting in prolonged thunderous applause.

    Today, in the Beijing Hall of the Great Hall of the People, gifts presented by Prime Minister U Nu to Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling, Vice-Chairman Dong Biwu, Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other state leaders were exhibited. During the intermission, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling, Vice-Chairman Dong Biwu, Chairman Zhu De, and other state leaders, accepted these gifts presented by Prime Minister U Nu.

    Also attending today's opening ceremony were: Vice-Premiers of the State Council Chen Yi and Xi Zhongxun, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Cheng Qian, and Panchen Erdeni Chökyi Gyaltsen, Vice-Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong and Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, Vice-Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Geng Biao, Chinese Ambassador to Burma Li Yimang, Vice-Presidents of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association Jian Bozan and Zhao Puchu, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Chu Tunan, and Vice-Mayor of Beijing Wu Han, among others.

    The distinguished Burmese guests visiting our country, Burmese Ambassador to China Kyao Winn, and embassy officials also attended the opening ceremony.

    Diplomatic envoys and officials from various countries stationed in China were also invited to attend the opening ceremony.

    A total of 10,000 people attended the opening ceremony.

    At the beginning of the opening ceremony, Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, delivered a speech. On behalf of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, he extended a heartfelt and warm welcome to Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, the Burmese Cultural Delegation, and all the distinguished Burmese guests.

    Zhang Xiruo said that as the Chinese people celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, China and Burma have signed the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, which is not only a great joyous event for the people of both China and Burma, but also a major international event at present. This event eloquently demonstrates that as long as the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are followed, and an attitude of mutual understanding, mutual concession, and friendly consultation is adopted, even complex issues such as the border between the two countries can be reasonably resolved through peaceful negotiations. He said that the smooth resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue is a shining victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and it has made an important contribution to peace in Asia and the world.

    Zhang Xiruo said that the "Paukphaw" (kinship) like friendship between the people of China and Burma is developing day by day. At such a time, the Burmese Cultural Delegation, bringing rich and colorful Burmese national art and the deep feelings of the Burmese people, has come to our country for a visit and performance, adding luster to the completion of the Sino-Burmese friendship edifice and adding a festive atmosphere to our National Day. He said that the Chinese people warmly welcome the cultural and friendship envoys of the Burmese people and firmly believe that this performance by the Burmese Cultural Delegation, which is large in scale, rich in content, and includes artists from various ethnic groups in Burma, will win the welcome and admiration of the Chinese people. And he firmly believes that through this visit and performance, the friendship between China and Burma will blossom with more beautiful flowers and bear more fruitful results.

    Next, Colonel So Min, head of the Burmese Cultural Delegation, spoke. He said that the Burmese Cultural Delegation's visit to China, led by Prime Minister U Nu, is mainly to participate in the Chinese people's festival—National Day—and the signing ceremony of the epoch-making Burmese-Chinese Boundary Treaty. Therefore, it has special significance.

    He said that since ancient times, there have been cultural and artistic exchanges between Burma and China. However, during the more than one hundred years when Burma was under imperialist rule, Burmese culture and art did not achieve the development it deserved. With Burma's independence, Burmese culture and art have also developed.

    So Min said: According to the Five Principles jointly advocated by the leaders of our two countries, we have built a solid edifice of friendship. In order to make this edifice of friendship more solid, it is also necessary to continuously irrigate it with the water of cultural and artistic friendship.

    So Min wished that the cultural exchanges between China and Burma would flow endlessly like the waters of the Nujiang and Salween Rivers. He hoped that artists from the two countries would have closer exchanges and cooperation.

    The speeches by Zhang Xiruo and So Min aroused bursts of warm applause.

    In today's premiere, the artists of the Burmese Cultural Delegation performed ancient Burmese dances and modern folk dances of various ethnic groups such as the Jingpo and Karen, as well as the one-act dance drama "Shanda Kinna Yi" and "The Story of the Irrawaddy River", and sang programs such as "The Song of Sino-Burmese Friendship" and "The Song of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty". The artists' chorus "The Song of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty" praised the friendship and unity between China and Burma, congratulated the everlasting close friendship between the two countries, and hailed the victorious signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. The artists' wonderful performances and enthusiastic praise of Sino-Burmese friendship were met with warm applause from the audience.

    After the performance, Premier Zhou Enlai, Prime Minister U Nu, and General Ne Win went on stage and shook hands with the performers one by one to congratulate them on their successful performance. Literary and art workers from the capital presented flower baskets to the Burmese performers. At this time, the Great Hall of the People once again resounded with prolonged applause.

    缅甸文化代表团盛大演出
    周恩来总理、吴努总理、奈温将军和首都一万观众出席开幕式
    新华社3日讯　文化部、对外文化联络委员会和中缅友好协会，今天下午在人民大会堂为缅甸文化代表团访华演出，举行了隆重的首次演出开幕式。在举国同庆建国十一周年和中缅边界条约正式签订的双喜临门的日子里，缅甸文化代表团的演出，更加增添了首都欢乐和友谊的气氛。
    周恩来总理、吴努总理和奈温将军，出席了今天的演出开幕式。当他们走进会场时，人民大会堂华灯齐放，全场起立，响起了长时间雷鸣般的掌声。
    今天，在人民大会堂的北京馆，展出了吴努总理赠送给毛泽东主席、刘少奇主席、宋庆龄副主席、董必武副主席、朱德委员长、周恩来总理和其他国家领导人的礼物。演出休息的时候，周恩来总理代表毛泽东主席、刘少奇主席、宋庆龄副主席、董必武副主席、朱德委员长和其他国家领导人接受了吴努总理赠送的这些礼物。
    出席今天演出开幕式的还有：国务院副总理陈毅、习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若、程潜、班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞，国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞，文化部部长沈雁冰，外交部副部长章汉夫、耿飚，我国驻缅甸大使李一氓，中缅友好协会副会长翦伯赞、赵朴初，中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南和北京市副市长吴晗等。
    前来我国进行友好访问的缅甸贵宾们、缅甸驻中国大使叫温和使馆官员，都出席了演出开幕式。
    各国驻中国的使节和外交官员，也应邀出席了演出开幕式。
    参加演出开幕式的共有一万人。
    对外文化联络委员会主任张奚若在演出开幕式开始时首先讲话。他代表中华人民共和国文化部、对外文化联络委员会和中缅友好协会，向吴努总理，奈温将军，缅甸文化代表团以及全体缅甸贵宾们表示衷心的热烈的欢迎。
    张奚若说，在中国人民欢庆中华人民共和国建国十一周年的时候，中缅两国签订了中缅边界条约，这不仅是中缅两国人民的大喜事，而且是当前国际上的重大事件，这一事件雄辩地说明了，只要根据和平共处五项原则，采取互谅互让、友好协商的态度，那怕是像两国边界这样复杂的问题，也可以通过和平谈判求得合理地解决。他说，中缅边界问题的顺利解决，是和平共处五项原则的光辉胜利，它对亚洲和世界和平作出了重要的贡献。
    张奚若说，中缅两国人民的“胞波”般的友谊正在日益发展。在这样的时候，缅甸文化代表团带着丰富多彩的缅甸民族艺术和缅甸人民的深情厚意来我国访问演出，为中缅友好大厦的落成增加了光彩，为我国国庆增添了欢乐的气氛。他说，中国人民热烈欢迎缅甸人民文化和友好的使者，深信通过这次规模巨大、丰富多彩，包括缅甸各民族艺术家的缅甸文化代表团的演出，必将赢得中国人民的欢迎和赞赏。并且坚信，通过这次访问演出，将使中缅友谊开出更艳丽的花朵，结出更丰硕的果实。
    接着，由缅甸文化代表团团长苏敏上校讲话。他说，缅甸文化代表团这次访华是由吴努总理率领而来的，主要是为了参加中国人民的佳节——国庆节和载入史册的缅中边界条约的签字仪式。因此，它具有特殊的意义。
    他说，自古以来缅中两国就有过文化艺术的交流。但是，在缅甸受到帝国主义统治的一百多年中，缅甸的文化艺术没有获得应有的发展。随着缅甸的独立，缅甸的文化艺术也得到了发展。
    苏敏说：根据我们两国领导人所共同倡导的五项原则，我们已经建成了牢固的友好大厦。为了使这座友好大厦更加巩固，还需用文化艺术的友谊之水来不断地浇灌它。
    苏敏祝中缅两国的文化交往像怒江和萨尔温江之水长流不息，他希望两国艺术家们将有更密切的来往和合作。
    张奚若和苏敏的讲话，激起了一阵阵热烈的掌声。
    在今天的首次演出中，缅甸文化代表团的艺术家们表演了缅甸的古代舞蹈和景颇、吉仁等各民族的现代民间舞蹈，表演了独幕舞剧“珊达京娜意”、“伊洛瓦底江的故事”，演唱了“中缅友谊之歌”、“中缅边界条约之歌”等节目。艺术家们的大合唱“中缅边界条约之歌”，歌颂了中缅两国的友谊、团结，祝贺两国的亲密友谊万古长青，欢呼中缅边界条约的胜利签订。艺术家们的精采表演和对中缅友谊的热情歌颂，全场不断报以热烈的掌声。
    演出结束后，周恩来总理、吴努总理和奈温将军登台和演员们一一握手，祝贺他们演出成功。首都文艺工作者向缅甸演员们献赠花篮。这时，人民大会堂再一次响起了经久不息的掌声。
