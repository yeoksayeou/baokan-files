　　Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch from Nairobi: The Kenyan people, responding to the call of the Kenya African National Union, held "Kenyatta Day" activities on the 20th to protest British colonial rule in Kenya and demand the release of Kenyan national movement leader Jomo Kenyatta.
　　The Kenya African National Union had called on the Kenyan people on the 18th to designate October 20th as "Kenyatta Day," to launch protest and boycott activities on that day, including not using transportation, not smoking, and not drinking alcohol.
　　According to reports, on the 20th, in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, a group of Africans held a demonstration and marched towards the British colonial government building. The demonstrators wore armbands reading "Release Kenyatta" and sang songs praising Kenyatta and freedom. The demonstrators submitted a letter to the British colonial governor of Kenya, pointing out that Kenyatta must be released. The letter stated, regarding the actions of some colonial officials who threatened to "resign" to oppose Kenyatta's release, that it would be beneficial to Kenya if these people left on the next plane.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 20th: A mass rally organized for "Kenya Day" was held here tonight, supporting the Kenyan people's struggle and demanding the release of Kenyan national movement leader Jomo Kenyatta.
　　October 20th is the anniversary of the day eight years ago when the Kenyan people heroically opposed British colonialism and were brutally massacred by the colonial authorities, and also the day Jomo Kenyatta was unreasonably arrested. In order to support the just struggle of the Kenyan people, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization decided in February 1959 to designate this day as "Kenya Day."
　　A resolution was passed at today's mass rally, warmly supporting the just struggle of the Kenyan people to achieve genuine and complete independence. The resolution strongly condemned Britain's consistent use of violence and intimidation to deal with the rising tide of national movements striving for national freedom.
　　Youssef El-Sebai, Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, delivered a speech at the mass rally, condemning the heinous activities of US and British imperialism in establishing military bases in Kenya and other places to strengthen the suppression of the national independence movements in Kenya and other African countries.
　　Sebai said, "With the support of Afro-Asian countries and peace-loving and freedom-loving countries in the world, the Kenyan people will continue their struggle more resolutely than before until final victory. They will never abandon their guiding principles, and they will work to achieve their sacred goals." He said he was sure the Kenyan people would soon achieve independence.

    怯尼亚人民举行“肯雅塔日”
    内罗毕非洲人示威要求释放肯雅塔
    开罗群众集会支持怯尼亚人民斗争
    据新华社21日讯　内罗毕消息：怯尼亚人民响应怯尼亚非洲民族联盟的号召，20日举行“肯雅塔日”的活动，抗议英国在怯尼亚的殖民统治，要求释放怯尼亚民族运动领袖乔莫·肯雅塔。
    怯尼亚非洲民族联盟曾于18日号召怯尼亚人民把10月20日作为“肯雅塔日”，在这一天展开抗议和抵制活动，包括不使用交通工具，不吸烟和不喝酒。
    据报道，20日那天，在怯尼亚首府内罗毕，一群非洲人举行了示威游行，走向英国殖民政府大厦。示威者佩带着“释放肯雅塔”的臂章，并高唱赞美肯雅塔和自由的歌曲。示威者向怯尼亚英国殖民总督递交了一封信件，指出必须释放肯雅塔。信中在谈到一些殖民官员为反对释放肯雅塔而用“辞职”进行威胁的行为时说，如果这些人乘下一班飞机离开，那是对怯尼亚有利的。
    新华社开罗20日电　为“怯尼亚日”组织的群众大会今晚在这里举行，大会支持怯尼亚人民的斗争，要求释放怯尼亚民族运动领袖乔莫·肯雅塔。
    10月20日是八年前怯尼亚人民英勇反对英国殖民主义而惨遭殖民当局血腥屠杀的日子，也是乔莫·肯雅塔遭到无理逮捕的日子。为了支持怯尼亚人民的正义斗争，亚非人民团结组织于1959年2月决定把这一天定为“怯尼亚日”。
    在今天的群众大会上通过了一项决议，热烈支持怯尼亚人民争取获得真正的、完全的独立的正义斗争。决议猛烈谴责英国一贯用暴力和威吓来对付争取民族自由的民族运动的高涨。
    亚非人民团结组织总书记优素福·西巴伊在群众大会上发表了演说，他谴责美、英帝国主义为了加强对怯尼亚和其他非洲国家的民族独立运动的镇压，在怯尼亚和其他地方建立军事基地的罪恶活动。
    西巴伊说，“在亚非和世界爱好和平和自由的国家的支持之下，怯尼亚人民会比以前更坚决地继续进行斗争，直到取得最后胜利为止。他们决不会放弃他们的指导原则，他们将为实现他们的神圣目的而努力。”他说，他可以肯定，怯尼亚人民不久将会取得独立。
