Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, Burmese Defense Forces Chief of Staff General Ne Win, and other distinguished guests from the Burmese government have successively departed from Beijing. Prime Minister U Nu and some of the distinguished guests will return home via Kunming; General Ne Win and some of the distinguished guests will visit various parts of southern China. During this visit, Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, and other Burmese distinguished guests celebrated our country's National Day together with the Chinese people; Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the People's Republic of China met with the Burmese distinguished guests. Our Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister U Nu formally signed the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty of great historical significance; the Prime Ministers of China and Burma also exchanged views on issues of common concern in sincere and friendly talks; the governments of China and Burma also issued a joint communiqué on the talks yesterday. The friendly visit to our country by the Burmese government delegation headed by Prime Minister U Nu has undoubtedly achieved significant accomplishments, writing a splendid chapter in the history of Sino-Burmese relations.

The joint communiqué of the Chinese and Burmese governments solemnly announced that, with the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Boundary Treaty between the two countries, an edifice symbolizing Sino-Burmese friendship has been successfully built under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by the two countries and based on the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, through the joint efforts of the people of both countries. The cornerstone of this Sino-Burmese friendship edifice is very solid. China and Burma are not only close neighbors with a long tradition of friendship, but more importantly, our two peoples have historically suffered from the oppression and enslavement of imperialism and colonialism, and have thus forged a fighting friendship in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism. After the independence of China and Burma, our two governments jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The people of China and Burma have a thousand and one reasons to live in harmony and cooperate in a friendly manner, and not a single reason to be alienated from each other or even cause any disputes. Even the boundary issue left over from history and caused by the imperialist policy of aggression cannot harm the friendship between the people of China and Burma in the slightest. Imperialists and their followers have attempted to use the boundary issue to sow discord between the people of China and Burma, but the governments and peoples of China and Burma have overcome all obstacles and shattered the imperialist sabotage conspiracy. Now, our two peoples can proudly say that the complex issues related to the Sino-Burmese border have been resolved smoothly and comprehensively. This proves that China and Burma have the ability not to act according to the wishes of the imperialists, but to resolve border issues and develop friendly relations according to the wishes of our two peoples. As Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out, China and Burma "have done something that is beneficial to China, beneficial to Burma, and beneficial to the world." Prime Minister U Nu also pointed out that the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty "is in the best interests of Burma, in the best interests of Sino-Burmese friendship, and in the best interests of peace in Asia and the world."

China and Burma are both peace-loving countries, and the people of China and Burma are both peace-loving people. Like many countries in Asia and Africa, China and Burma have not been free from imperialist oppression for long, and are facing the serious tasks of safeguarding their national independence and building their own countries. The people of our two countries need a peaceful international environment. Therefore, the joint communiqué of the Chinese and Burmese governments pointed out to the world: "Sincerely adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the policy of friendly consultation will help ease international tensions and thus pave the way for achieving universal disarmament and striving for lasting peace." In the joint communiqué, the two Prime Ministers once again emphasized that the two governments will continue to work to expand the area of peace and friendship. The successful resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue has set a good example in this regard. This is a great victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and a major blow to the imperialist policy of aggression and war in Asia. Precisely because of this, all fair-minded public opinion in the world has warmly applauded the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, while only the imperialists and their followers are greatly displeased. However, let that small handful of people go off and sulk; the people of China and Burma, the people of Asia and Africa, are ultimately going to firmly follow their own path.

In their talks, the Prime Ministers of China and Burma frankly and amicably exchanged views on the international situation. They unanimously agreed that "the current development of the international situation is unprecedentedly favorable to the struggle against colonialism." The great rise of the Asian people's struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs, the surging of the African national independence movement, and the vigorous development of the national democratic movements of the Latin American countries, represented by Cuba, against US imperialist aggression and oppression, all prove the correctness of this conclusion. However, the imperialist forces of aggression and war, headed by the United States, are not reconciled to their defeat and are carrying out frenzied struggles and counterattacks everywhere. Therefore, the people of Asia and Africa and the people of all countries in the world need to further strengthen their unity and persevere in their struggle. In the joint communiqué, the Prime Ministers of China and Burma expressed sympathy and support for the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa for a new life of independence, dignity, progress, and prosperity, which embodies the Bandung spirit of Asian-African solidarity and is also an encouragement to the people of Asia and Africa who are struggling.

In recent days, from Beijing to Yangon, there has been an atmosphere of festive celebration; the "Pauk Phaw" (fraternal) feelings between the people of China and Burma, like warm sunshine, have bathed the lands of our two close neighbors. The capitals of China and Burma held grand celebration rallies for the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty; residents on the borders of the two countries held get-togethers and celebrations. The two governments have also announced that, following Prime Minister U Nu's visit to China, our Premier Zhou Enlai will be invited to pay a friendly visit to Burma in early January next year. During his visit to Burma, Premier Zhou Enlai will exchange instruments of ratification of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty with Prime Minister U Nu and participate in the celebrations of the 13th anniversary of the independence of the Union of Burma. Once the edifice of Sino-Burmese friendship and cooperation is completed, the economic and cultural ties between our two countries will also be further expanded. In the joint communiqué, the Prime Ministers of China and Burma reiterated the solemn determination of the two countries to maintain, consolidate, and expand this edifice of Sino-Burmese friendship and cooperation. This is the common will and sacred duty of the people of China and Burma. We firmly believe that, as time goes by, thanks to the concerted efforts of the people of China and Burma, this edifice will radiate even more brilliant light, shining on the vast land of Asia!

    让中缅友好大厦更加灿烂辉煌
    缅甸联邦总理吴努、缅甸国防军总参谋长奈温将军和缅甸政府代表团的其他贵宾们，已经先后离开了北京。吴努总理和一部分贵宾将取道昆明回国；奈温将军和一部分贵宾将去我国南方各地参观。在这次访问期间，吴努总理、奈温将军和其他缅甸的贵宾们同中国人民一道欢度了我国的国庆佳节；中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东、中华人民共和国主席刘少奇接见了缅甸的贵宾们。我国周恩来总理和吴努总理正式签订了具有重大历史意义的中缅边界条约；中缅两国总理还在诚挚和友好的会谈中就共同关心的问题交换了意见；中缅两国政府昨天还发表了会谈的联合公报。以吴努总理为首的缅甸政府代表团这次对我国的友好访问，无疑地已取得了重大的成就，在中缅两国的关系史上写下了灿烂辉煌的一章。
    中缅两国政府的联合公报庄严地宣布，由于友好和互不侵犯条约和两国边界条约的签订，象征中缅友好的大厦已经在两国共同倡导的和平共处五项原则指导下，根据互谅互让的精神，通过两国人民的共同努力成功地建立起来了。这座中缅友好大厦的基石，是非常坚固的。中缅两国不仅是有着悠久传统友谊的紧密的邻邦，而且更重要的是，我们两国人民在历史上共同遭受帝国主义和殖民主义的压迫和奴役，因而在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同斗争中结成了战斗的友谊。在中缅两国各自独立之后，我们两国政府又共同倡导了和平共处的五项原则。中缅两国人民有千条万条理由和睦相处和友好合作，而没有任何一条理由彼此疏远，甚至引起任何纷争。即使是历史上遗留下来的、由帝国主义侵略政策所造成的边界问题，也不能丝毫损害中缅两国人民之间的友谊。帝国主义及其追随者们曾企图利用边界问题在中缅两国人民之间进行挑拨离间，但是，中缅两国政府和人民排除了一切障碍，粉碎了帝国主义的破坏阴谋。现在我们两国人民可以骄傲地说，有关中缅边界的复杂问题，已经顺利地全面地解决了。这证明，中缅两国有本事不按照帝国主义的愿望办事，而按照两国人民自己的愿望来解决边界问题，发展友好关系。正如周恩来总理所指出的，中缅两国“做了一件有利于中国、有利于缅甸，也有利于世界的事情”。吴努总理也指出，中缅边界条约，“符合缅甸的最高利益，符合中缅友谊以及亚洲和世界和平的最高利益”。
    中缅两国都是爱好和平的国家，中缅两国人民都是热爱和平的人民。中缅两国和亚非许多国家一样，摆脱帝国主义的压迫都不算久，都面临着维护自己的民族独立和建设自己国家的严重任务。我们两国人民都需要一个和平的国际环境。因此，中缅两国政府的联合公报向全世界指出：“真诚地奉行和平共处五项原则和友好协商的政策，将有助于和缓国际紧张局势，从而为达成普遍裁军和争取持久和平铺平道路。”两国总理在联合公报中还再一次强调两国政府将继续努力来扩大和平友好的地区。中缅边界问题的圆满解决，已经在这方面作出了良好的榜样，这是和平共处五项原则的伟大胜利，是对帝国主义在亚洲的侵略和战争政策的重大打击。正是因为这样，全世界一切公正舆论都为中缅边界条约的签订而热烈欢呼，而只有帝国主义及其追随者们大为不高兴。但是，让那一小撮人去向隅而泣吧，中缅两国人民，亚非各国人民终是要坚定地走自己的道路的。
    中缅两国总理在会谈中，对于国际形势坦率而友好地交换了意见。他们一致认为，“目前国际形势的发展对反对殖民主义空前有利。”亚洲各国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴的伟大兴起、非洲民族独立运动的风起云涌和以古巴为代表的拉丁美洲各国人民反对美帝国主义侵略和压迫的民族民主运动的蓬勃发展，都证明了这个论断的正确性。但是，以美国为首的帝国主义侵略和战争势力并不甘心于自己的失败，正在到处进行着疯狂的挣扎和反扑，因此，亚非人民和全世界各国人民需要进一步加强团结，坚持斗争。中缅两国总理在联合公报中表示同情和支持亚非各国人民争取独立、尊严、进步和繁荣的新生活而斗争，这体现了亚非团结的万隆精神，也是对正在斗争中的亚非各国人民的鼓舞。
    这几天来，从北京到仰光，洋溢着喜庆节日的气氛；中缅两国人民之间的“胞波”感情像温暖的阳光一样，沐浴着我们这两个紧密邻邦的国土。中缅两国首都为中缅边界条约的签订举行了盛大的庆祝大会；两国边境的居民举行了联欢和庆祝会。两国政府并且宣布，继吴努总理访华之后，我国周恩来总理将应邀在明年1月初到缅甸进行友好访问。周恩来总理在访缅期间，将同吴努总理交换中缅边界条约的批准书，并参加缅甸联邦独立十三周年庆典。中缅友好合作的大厦一经落成，我们两国的经济和文化联系也将要进一步扩大。在联合公报中，中缅两国总理重申了两国庄严的决心，将维护、巩固和扩大这座中缅友好合作的大厦。这是中缅两国人民共同的意志和神圣的职责。我们深信，随着时间的推移，由于中缅两国人民的一致努力，这座大厦将放射出更加灿烂的光彩，辉耀在亚洲广阔的土地上！
