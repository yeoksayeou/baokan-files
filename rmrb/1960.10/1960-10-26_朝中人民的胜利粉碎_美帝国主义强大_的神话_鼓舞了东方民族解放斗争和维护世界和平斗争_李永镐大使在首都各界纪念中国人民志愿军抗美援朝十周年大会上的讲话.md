Xinhua News Agency, 25th - Speech by Li Yong-ho, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, at the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea by people from all walks of life in the capital. The full text is as follows:
    Respected Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai, Respected Comrade Vice Premier Chen Yi, Respected Comrade Guo Moruo, Dear former officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Dear citizens of Beijing and Comrades:
    Today, the people of Korea and China solemnly commemorate the tenth anniversary of the participation of the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean War, using their blood to aid the Korean people in their just fatherland liberation war against the armed aggression of the sixteen nations headed by the U.S. imperialism.
    Officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, shoulder to shoulder with the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, sharing joys and sorrows, fought bravely against the common enemy, the U.S. imperialist aggressors, and won victory.
    Therefore, the Korean people today commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, paying the highest honor and expressing the deepest gratitude to the fraternal Chinese people.
    U.S. imperialism attempted to conquer the Korean people, to burn the flames of war to the Chinese mainland, and to recover from the disastrous defeats it suffered under the fierce counterattacks of our People's Army. Therefore, it mobilized all its forces in the Pacific region and launched the most barbaric war of aggression. At this time of the most severe test for the Korean people, the Chinese people held high the banner of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, organized their finest sons and daughters into the Volunteers, and sent them to the Korean front.
    At that time, the People's Republic of China had just been founded, and there were numerous difficulties in internal and external affairs. Despite this, the Chinese people were unanimously mobilized and determined to share the fate of the Korean people and eliminate the common enemy.
    The participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean War infinitely inspired our people and our People's Army, fundamentally changing the situation of the Korean War in our favor.
    In the face of the united power of the Korean and Chinese peoples, U.S. imperialism suffered one disastrous defeat after another, and as a result, had to bow its knees to the Korean and Chinese peoples and sign the armistice agreement.
    The Korean and Chinese peoples won victory in the Korean War, the most intense war in history, thereby completely shattering the myth of "American imperialism's strength." This is not only a great victory for the Korean and Chinese peoples, but also a historic victory for the oppressed peoples and peace-loving people of the world.
    The victory won by the Korean and Chinese peoples in the Korean War shattered the U.S. imperialist aggressive plot to launch a new world war. This greatly inspired the national liberation struggle of the Eastern peoples and the struggle of the people of the world to safeguard peace.
    During the Korean War, the Korean and Chinese peoples demonstrated the indomitable fighting spirit and endless revolutionary strength of the awakened people of the socialist new East. At the same time, it showed that aggressors who infringe upon the people of the socialist camp are bound to end in tragic failure under the collective counterattack of the people of socialist countries.
    The Korean and Chinese peoples are close neighbors separated only by a river. The deep friendship and unity between the two peoples was especially strengthened through the struggle against Japanese imperialism; in the new stage when our country relied on the great Soviet army to be liberated from the shackles of Japanese imperialism and the Chinese revolution was liberated, it was comprehensively consolidated and developed.
    The friendship and unity of the Korean and Chinese peoples shines even more brightly in the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism.
    The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, led by the Chinese Communist Party and educated by its Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, guarded every high ground and village with blood alongside the Korean People's Army; in the struggle against the enemy, they demonstrated unparalleled heroism and a spirit of collective heroism.
    Huang Jiguang, a hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers, blocked the enemy's gun muzzle with his chest, ensuring the victory of the battle; Yang Gensi, a hero, sacrificed his only youth for the happiness of the Korean people; Luo Shengjiao, a martyr, saved a Korean child with his life.
    All the officers and soldiers of the Volunteers and the Volunteer warriors present today fought bravely with the spirit of heroes like Huang Jiguang, Yang Gensi, and Luo Shengjiao, gloriously fulfilling the oath they swore before the Chinese Communist Party and its leaders: "...Love every mountain, river, tree, and blade of grass in Korea, unite as one with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, and completely eliminate the U.S. imperialist aggressor army!"
    The blood shed by the warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea will shine forever along with the beautiful mountains and rivers of Korea; the example of internationalist spirit made by the warriors of the Volunteers will always be remembered in the hearts of the Korean people.
    The friendship and unity shown by the Korean and Chinese peoples in the common struggle against the U.S. imperialist aggressors has in fact become a brilliant example of proletarian internationalism.
    In the post-war period, the great Chinese people and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the people of the fraternal countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, sincerely aided the Korean people.
    After the war, in the difficult recovery period when everything was destroyed, the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers aided the Korean people materially and spiritually with the feeling of rebuilding their own homes.
    The great achievements made by the Volunteer warriors on the land of Korea and the beautiful stories left behind are spreading like legends in our cities and villages.
    Today, to commemorate this day, many Volunteer warriors who have made immortal contributions and their relatives have attended this grand meeting. In particular, Comrade Luo Diekai, the father of Luo Shengjiao from the distant Hunan Province, is also present. In front of all the comrades, I would like to once again express my heartfelt greetings and high respect to all the Volunteer warriors who participated in the Korean War, their relatives, and the Chinese people through you.
    Comrades!
    The power of the Korean and Chinese peoples, which caused the U.S. imperialist aggressors to suffer irreparable defeat in the more than three years of intense war, is growing stronger and stronger along with the strengthening of the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    The 650 million great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, have achieved tremendous achievements in the great leap forward of socialist construction.
    Today, the People's Republic of China is rapidly transforming into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and advanced science and culture.
    The Korean people have always learned from the achievements and experiences of the Chinese people and have been inspired by them.
    The Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, have made tremendous achievements in socialist construction, and continue to gallop forward on the Chollima in the struggle to build socialism.
    The successful construction of socialism in our two countries and the strengthening of the friendly unity between the two peoples are a huge force for finally driving the imperialist aggressive forces out of the East, establishing lasting peace, and guaranteeing the victory of socialism.
    Since the united power of the Korean and Chinese peoples is inseparable from the power of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, it is even more invincible.
    Comrades!
    For eight years, the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers shared life and death with the Korean people, brilliantly completing the sacred mission of "Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, Protecting Our Homes and Defending Our Country," and have all withdrawn from Korea in accordance with the proposal of the Korean and Chinese governments.
    The Chinese People's Volunteers' initiative to withdraw from Korea opened up a new situation for the peaceful reunification of our motherland and made a great contribution to the great cause of easing the tense situation in the Far East.
    However, U.S. imperialism has not accepted the lessons it deserved in the Korean War. Today, it still occupies the southern half of our country's land and is frantically carrying out new military provocations, plunging the southern half into an abyss of hunger and misery.
    At present, the South Korean people are continuing their heroic struggle, demanding freedom and the right to survive, and opposing U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.
    The only way to clean up the current situation in South Korea and thoroughly solve the Korean question, as Comrade Kim Il-sung re-emphasized at the rally celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of the August 15th liberation of the Korean people, is to: "Force the withdrawal of American troops and peacefully reunify the motherland."
    Now, the puppets in South Korea, unable to withstand the strong pressure of the people, are talking about "peaceful reunification" in words, but are also clamoring for "elections under UN supervision."
    This is an intolerable insult to the Korean people and an act of treason. The unification of Korea is a matter for the Koreans themselves, and must be resolved by the Koreans themselves through free general elections in the North and South on a democratic basis, free from any external interference. U.S. imperialism must get out of South Korea!
    Two years after the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from Korea, the U.S. imperialist aggressor army has no excuse to occupy South Korea. Any struggle by U.S. imperialism cannot stop the Korean people from advancing.
    U.S. imperialism, which makes a fortune from war, is not only in South Korea but also frantically intensifying the tense situation everywhere in the world. At the same time, U.S. imperialism continues to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and interfere in China's internal affairs.
    However, U.S. imperialist aggressors must recognize the great strength of the people of the socialist East. It is impossible not to remember the historical lessons of the tragic defeat suffered in the Korean War in the face of the united power of the Korean and Chinese peoples. The Korean people will always maintain a high degree of vigilance against the conspiracies of the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples and the most ferocious enemy of mankind, U.S. imperialism, and will continue to completely smash their acts of aggression!
    The Korean people, who are directly confronting and fighting the U.S. imperialist aggressors, will resolutely struggle in order to further strengthen the traditional friendship and unity with the fraternal Chinese people in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, to safeguard peace and the great cause of socialism, and to completely smash the aggressive plots of U.S. imperialism.
    Finally, I sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese people continued brilliant achievements in the great leap forward of socialist construction.
    Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity forged with blood by the Korean and Chinese peoples!
    Long live the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live world peace!
    Eternal glory belongs to the internationalist warriors educated and cultivated by the great Chinese Communist Party—the former officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers!

    朝中人民的胜利粉碎“美帝国主义强大”的神话  鼓舞了东方民族解放斗争和维护世界和平斗争
    李永镐大使在首都各界纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝十周年大会上的讲话
  新华社25日讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使李永镐在首都各界人民纪念志愿军抗美援朝出国作战十周年大会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的周恩来总理同志，尊敬的陈毅副总理同志，尊敬的郭沫若同志，亲爱的前志愿军官兵同志们，亲爱的北京市民和各位同志：
    今天，朝中两国人民，隆重纪念兄弟的中国人民志愿军参加朝鲜战争、用鲜血援助朝鲜人民为反对以美帝国主义为元凶的十六国武装侵略者而进行的正义祖国解放战争十周年。
    中国人民志愿军官兵，同朝鲜人民军官兵并肩，同甘共苦，英勇战斗，反对共同的敌人美帝国主义侵略者，获得了胜利。
    因此，朝鲜人民今天纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝参战十周年，向兄弟的中国人民致以最崇高的荣誉，表示最深切的感谢。
    美帝国主义妄图征服朝鲜人民，把战火烧向中国大陆，并为了挽回它在我们的人民军猛烈反击下遭到的惨败，因而出动了它在太平洋地区的全部力量，进行了最野蛮的侵略战争。在这个对于朝鲜人民来说是最严重的考验的时期，中国人民高举抗美援朝的旗帜，把自己的优秀儿女组成志愿军，派到朝鲜前线。
    当时，中华人民共和国刚刚成立，在内外工作方面存在着重重难关。尽管如此，中国人民却一致动员起来，决心同朝鲜人民共命运，消灭共同的敌人。
    中国人民志愿军参加朝鲜战争，无限鼓舞了我国人民和我们的人民军，使得朝鲜战争局势从根本上变得对我们有利。
    在朝中人民的团结威力面前，美帝国主义接二连三地遭到惨败，结果不得不向朝中人民屈膝，在停战协定上签字。
    朝中两国人民，在历史上最激烈的战争——朝鲜战争当中，获得了胜利，从而彻底粉碎了“美帝国主义强大”的神话。这不仅是朝中两国人民的伟大胜利，而且也是全世界被压迫人民和爱好和平人民历史性的胜利。
    朝中两国人民在朝鲜战争中获得的胜利，粉碎了美帝国主义企图发动新世界战争的侵略阴谋。这大大鼓舞了东方人民的民族解放斗争和全世界人民维护和平的斗争。
    在朝鲜战争当中，朝中两国人民显示出觉醒了的社会主义新东方人民不屈不挠的斗志，和无穷无尽的革命力量。同时也显示：侵犯社会主义阵营国家人民的侵略者，在社会主义国家人民集体反击之下，必定以悲惨的失败而告终。
    朝中两国人民是只有一江之隔的近邻，两国人民的深情厚谊和团结，通过反对日本帝国主义的斗争，特别得到了加强；在我国依靠伟大苏联军队从日本帝国主义枷锁下获得解放和中国革命获得解放的新阶段，又全面地巩固和发展起来。
    朝中两国人民的友谊和团结威力，在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，更加光芒万丈。
    中国共产党领导下的、并受其马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义思想教育的中国人民志愿军官兵们，同朝鲜人民军一道，用鲜血死守了每一个高地和村庄；在同敌人的斗争中，发挥了无比的英勇精神和集体英雄主义精神。
    中国人民志愿军英雄黄继光，用自己的胸膛堵住了敌人的枪口，保证了战斗的胜利，英雄杨根思，为了朝鲜人民的幸福，献出了自己只有一次的青春；烈士罗盛教，用自己的生命拯救了朝鲜孩子。
    志愿军全体官兵和今天在座的志愿军勇士们，都用黄继光、杨根思、罗盛教等英雄那样的精神，英勇地进行了战斗，光荣地履行了他们在中国共产党及其领袖面前所宣的誓：“……爱护朝鲜的一山一水、一草一木，同朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军团结一心，彻底消灭美帝国主义侵略军！”
    中国人民志愿军勇士们在朝鲜锦绣江山洒下的鲜血，将同朝鲜美丽的山河一道永放光彩；志愿军勇士们所作出的国际主义精神榜样，将永远铭记在朝鲜人民的心上。
    朝中人民在反对美帝国主义侵略者的共同斗争中所表现的友谊和团结，实际上已经成为无产阶级国际主义精神的光辉典范。
    战后时期，伟大的中国人民和英雄的中国人民志愿军，又同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各兄弟国家人民一道，诚心诚意地援助了朝鲜人民。
    战后，在我们一切都遭到破坏的艰苦的恢复时期，中国人民志愿军官兵，又怀着重建自己家园的心情，从物质上和精神上援助了朝鲜人民。
    志愿军勇士们在朝鲜土地上建立的丰功伟绩，留下的美丽故事，正像传说一样流传在我国的城市和乡村。
    今天，为了纪念这一天，许多建立不朽功绩的志愿军勇士和他们的亲人参加了这一盛会。特别是来自遥远的湖南省的罗盛教的父亲罗迭开同志也在座。在各位同志面前，我通过你们向全体参加过朝鲜战争的志愿军勇士们、他们的亲人和中国人民，再一次表示衷心的问候和崇高的敬意。
    同志们！
    在三年多的激烈战争中使得美帝国主义侵略者遭到不可挽回的失败的朝中两国人民的威力，同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营威力的加强一道，正在日益壮大和加强。
    六亿五千万伟大的中国人民，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在社会主义建设大跃进中，获得了巨大的成就。
    今天，中华人民共和国正在迅速转变成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和先进科学与文化的伟大的社会主义强国。
    朝鲜人民一向学习中国人民的成就和经验，并从中受到鼓舞。
    朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党领导下，在社会主义建设中获得了巨大的成就，并且在建设社会主义的斗争中，继续跨上千里马向前飞奔。
    在我们两国成功地建设社会主义和两国人民友好团结的加强，对于把帝国主义侵略势力最后赶出东方、建立持久和平，对于保障社会主义胜利，是一股巨大的力量。
    由于朝中两国人民的团结威力是同以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的威力分不开的，因此它更是不可战胜的。
    同志们！
    在八年当中，中国人民志愿军官兵同朝鲜人民同生死共患难，辉煌地完成了“抗美援朝保家卫国”的神圣使命，并且根据朝中两国政府的建议，已经全部撤出朝鲜。
    中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜，为我们祖国和平统一的前途打开了新的局面，对于缓和远东紧张局势这一伟大事业，作出了巨大贡献。
    然而，美帝国主义却没有接受它在朝鲜战争中应得的教训，今天仍然霸占着我国的南半部土地，疯狂地进行新的军事挑衅策动，从而使南半部陷入饥饿和涂炭的深渊。
    目前，南朝鲜人民正在继续进行英勇的斗争，要求自由和生存权利，反对美帝国主义及其走狗。
    收拾南朝鲜目前的局面、彻底解决朝鲜问题的唯一途径，正如金日成同志在庆祝朝鲜人民的全民节日八·一五解放十五周年大会上所再次阐明的，就是：“迫使美国军队撤出去，和平统一祖国。”
    现在，南朝鲜的傀儡们，经受不住人民强大的压力，虽然口头上也谈什么“和平统一”，但却又在叫嚣实行“联合国监督下的选举”。
    这是对朝鲜人民的不能容忍的侮辱，是卖国行为。朝鲜的统一，是朝鲜人自己的事，必须不受任何外部干涉，通过在民主基础上实行南北自由普选的方式，由朝鲜人自己解决。美帝国主义必须滚出南朝鲜！
    在中国人民志愿军已经撤出朝鲜两年的今天，美帝国主义侵略军队没有霸占南朝鲜的任何借口了。美帝国主义的任何挣扎，也阻止不住朝鲜人民前进。
    靠战争发财的美帝国主义，不仅在南朝鲜，而且在全世界到处疯狂地加剧紧张局势。同时，美帝国主义还继续霸占着中国的领土台湾，干涉中国的内政。
    然而，美帝国主义侵略者必须认清社会主义东方人民的伟大力量，不记住朝鲜战争中在朝中两国人民团结威力面前遭受惨败的历史教训是不行的。对于朝中两国人民共同的敌人、人类最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义的阴谋策动，朝鲜人民永远保持高度的警惕，并将继续彻底粉碎它们的侵略行为！
    直接同美帝国主义侵略者对峙并战斗的朝鲜人民，为了在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中进一步加强同兄弟的中国人民的传统友谊和团结，为了维护和平和社会主义伟大事业，为了彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，将坚决地斗争下去。
    最后，我衷心地祝愿兄弟的中国人民在社会主义建设大跃进中继续获得辉煌的成就。
    朝中两国人民用鲜血结成的牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结一致万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    辉耀万世的光荣属于伟大中国共产党教育和培养出来的国际主义战士们—前中国人民志愿军官兵们！
