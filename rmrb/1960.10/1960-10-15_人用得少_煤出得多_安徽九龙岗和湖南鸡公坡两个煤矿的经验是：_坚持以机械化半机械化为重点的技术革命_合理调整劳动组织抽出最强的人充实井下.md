Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Dispatch: The Jiulonggang Coal Mine in Huainan is doing everything possible to tap labor potential and replenish the coal extraction front line. In the first half of September, the mine's coal extraction workers increased from 66.5% of all employees in August to 69.2%; auxiliary workers decreased from 33.5% in August to 30.8%. The replenishment of manpower on the coal extraction front line has powerfully promoted production. The average daily output of raw coal in the first half of September increased by 5.4% compared with August, and the average daily footage of tunneling increased by 3% compared with August.
　　In July of this year, the Jiulonggang Coal Mine promoted the spirit of communist cooperation and transferred 104 production workers and 102 cadres to support the newly built Lizizui Coal Mine. In August, the mine's Party committee decided to build two more coal extraction teams to further improve the level of coal production. But where would the labor needed to build the teams come from? After the Party committee secretary and Party committee members conducted in-depth investigations and research at the grassroots level, they found that although the number of auxiliary workers in the mine had decreased compared with the past, there was still potential to be tapped. The mine's Party committee adopted four measures to adjust the labor organization: ① Actively mobilize the masses to reform production technology. For example, the transportation area shortened the distance of manual pushing by reforming the transportation track and extending the electric locomotive track, and under the condition of ensuring safe transportation, many marshalling yards were changed to sliding car delivery, which doubled the work efficiency. ② Merge some processes and businesses that can be merged. ③ Adopt the method of substituting the weak with the strong, and replace the "elite soldiers" in the auxiliary departments to the coal extraction front line. ④ Strengthen labor management and improve work efficiency. When rectifying the labor organization, all non-production units adopted the method of "fixing personnel, fixing quotas, and fixing tasks" to make reasonable arrangements for the labor force in their units. After taking these measures, at the beginning of September, the mine had transferred 211 people from the auxiliary production departments, and in addition to forming more than 120 of them into a coal mining training team and a tunneling training team, the rest were replenished to basic construction and other production units.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Dispatch: The Jigongpo Coal Mine in Xiangtan City, Hunan Province, has taken various measures to rationally arrange labor and save labor, ensuring a continuous leap forward in production. The average number of employees from January to August decreased by 215 compared with the same period last year, while the total output of raw coal increased by 87% compared with the same period last year. By the 26th of September, the mine had completed its monthly plan ahead of schedule.

The mine's production task this year increased by 67% compared with last year. If calculated according to the proportion of the increase in production tasks, more than 600 people would need to be added this year. In order to achieve the goal of increasing production without increasing personnel, the Party branch widely carried out education on taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and education on increasing production and practicing economy centered on grain and steel among the workers, so that the broad masses of workers further understood the great significance of saving labor; on this basis, they led the mine's workers in vigorously carrying out labor competitions and technical revolutions. The mine's workers offered suggestions and ideas focusing on the key to production, and they self-made indigenous winches and indigenous water pumps, and built new transportation lines, realizing the mechanization of drainage, lifting, and ventilation in the entire mine, saving 366 laborers.

Another method for this coal mine to save labor is to combine the 52 types of work, both underground and on the surface, in the entire mine into 27 types of work in a planned, led, and step-by-step manner through mass discussions. After the work types were combined, a total of 63 strong laborers were extracted and replenished to the main attack line. The combination of work types not only did not affect production, but also further mobilized the workers' enthusiasm for production. By merging and compressing surface labor and non-production personnel, the number of underground production workers rapidly increased from 56% of the mine's employees to 83%, greatly strengthening the coal extraction front line.

Because the Jigongpo Coal Mine took these measures and rationally arranged labor, the mine not only did not increase personnel according to the original plan this year, but also extracted people to set up factories for red bricks and cement to solve the problem of red brick and cement supply by themselves. At the same time, 292 strong laborers were extracted to support the neighboring coal mines.

### 人用得少　煤出得多  安徽九龙岗和湖南鸡公坡两个煤矿的经验是：  坚持以机械化半机械化为重点的技术革命  合理调整劳动组织抽出最强的人充实井下

    人用得少　煤出得多
    安徽九龙岗和湖南鸡公坡两个煤矿的经验是：
    坚持以机械化半机械化为重点的技术革命
    合理调整劳动组织抽出最强的人充实井下
    据新华社合肥电　淮南九龙岗煤矿千方百计挖掘劳动潜力，充实采掘第一线。9月上半月，全矿采掘工人已由8月份占全部职工的66.5％增加到69.2％；辅助工由8月份的占33.5％降低到30.8％。采掘第一线的人力充实以后，有力地推动了生产。9月上半月的原煤平均日产量比8月份提高5.4％，掘进平均日进尺比8月份提高3％。
  今年7月份，九龙岗煤矿发扬共产主义协作精神，曾抽调出一百零四名生产工人和一百零二名干部支援了新建的李咀孜煤矿。8月份，这个矿的党委决定再新建两个采掘队，进一步提高煤炭生产水平。但是建队所需要的劳动力从那里来呢？党委书记和党委委员深入基层进行调查研究后，发现全矿辅助工虽然比以前有所减少，但还有潜力可挖。矿党委采取了四项措施来调整劳动组织：①积极发动群众，改革生产技术，如运输区通过改革运输轨道和延长电机车轨道，缩短了人力推车距离，并且在保证安全运输的条件下，把许多车场改成了滑式送车，工效成倍提高。②合并一些可以合并的工序和业务。③采取以弱换强的办法，把辅助部门中的“精兵”替换到采掘第一线。④加强劳动管理，提高工效。各非生产单位在整顿劳动组织时，都采用了“定员、定额、定任务”的办法，对本单位的劳动力作了合理安排。采取这些措施后，全矿9月初已从辅助生产部门中抽调出二百十一人，除将其中的一百二十多人组成了一个培训采煤队和一个培训掘进队外，其余都充实到基本建设等生产单位。
    据新华社长沙电　湖南湘潭市鸡公坡煤矿采取各种措施，合理安排劳动力，节约使用劳动力，保证生产持续跃进。1至8月份平均职工人数比去年同期减少二百一十五个，而原煤总产量却比去年同期增长了87％。9月份到26日，全矿就提前完成了月计划。
    这个矿今年的生产任务比去年增长67％，如果按生产任务增长的比例计算，今年需要增加六百多人。为了实现增产不增人，党总支在职工中广泛进行国民经济以农业为基础的教育和以粮、钢为中心的增产节约教育，使广大职工进一步懂得了节约使用劳动力的重大意义；在这个基础上，领导全矿职工大搞劳动竞赛大闹技术革命。全矿职工针对生产关键献谋献计，自制土绞车，土水泵，新建运输线，实现了全矿排水、提升、通风机械化，节约劳动力三百六十六个。
    这个煤矿节约使用人力的另一办法，是有计划、有领导、有步骤地将全矿井下、地面两线五十二个工种，通过群众讨论，合并为二十七个工种，经过工种合并，共抽出精壮劳动力六十三个，充实了主攻战线。工种合并不仅没有影响生产，而且进一步调动了职工的生产极积性。通过合并、压缩地面劳力和非生产人员，使井下生产工人由占全矿职工56％迅速上升到83％，大大加强了采掘第一线。
    鸡公坡煤矿由于采取了这些措施，合理地安排了劳动力，今年全矿不但没有按原计划增人，而且还抽人办起了红砖、水泥等厂，自己解决红砖、水泥的供应问题。同时还抽出了二百九十二个精壮劳动力，分别支援了邻近的煤矿。
