Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 13th: According to the latest issue of the "Thought" weekly published in Bombay, India, in West Bengal, India, one out of every two urban families is directly affected by unemployment. Nearly half of the farmers have no land.

    The weekly, in a dispatch from Calcutta, stated, "Currently, there are 925,000 unemployed people in urban areas. Based on a standard of five people per family, this shocking fact indicates that one out of every two urban families is directly affected by unemployment."

    The weekly stated, "The government understands that this problem is dangerously worsening, but it feels helpless."

    The weekly continued, "There are already 260,000 people registered in West Bengal at employment agencies. This includes approximately 6,000 women." The weekly said, "More and more middle-class women are now seeking employment. One reason is that the cost of living has risen so high that middle-class families cannot maintain a balance between income and expenditure and maintain their living standards unless women also have income."

    The weekly stated that in rural West Bengal, more and more farmers are losing their land, and now nearly half of the farmers have no land. The situation of total and partial unemployment in rural areas is also extremely serious.

    印度孟买“思潮”周刊报道
    西孟加拉邦广大城市居民失业
    在农村中将近一半农民没有土地
    据新华社13日讯　新德里消息：据在孟买出版的最近一期的“思潮”周刊透露，在印度的西孟加拉邦，每两个城市家庭中就有一个家庭直接受到失业的影响。将近一半的农民没有土地。
    这家周刊在来自加尔各答的消息中说，“目前在城市地区有九十二万五千人失业。以每个家庭有五口人作为标准，那么这个令人吃惊的事实表明，每两个城市家庭中就有一个家庭直接受到失业的影响。”
    这家周刊说，“政府明白这个问题正在危险地恶化，但是它感到束手无策。”
    这家周刊继续说，“在西孟加拉邦在职业介绍所登记的人已有二十六万。其中包括大约六千名妇女。”这家周刊说，“越来越多的中产阶级的妇女现在正在寻找职业。原因之一是，生活费用已经上涨得这样高，因此除非妇女也有收入，否则中产阶级家庭就不可能维持收支平衡，维持他们的生活水平。”
    这家周刊说，在西孟加拉邦的农村，越来越多的农民失去土地，现在有将近一半的农民没有土地。农村的全失业和半失业的情况也是极为严重的。
