    Taking Pleasure in Agriculture, Endless Joy
    Wang Baojing, Fenghuo Commune, Qian County, Shaanxi

    In the countryside, there are some educated youth who believe that farming is not promising and has no future. In the past, I also had such foolish thoughts. Although I was a poor child born and raised in the countryside, I was unwilling to do agricultural work immediately after liberation under the leadership of the Party. Later, the Party branch secretary patiently educated and enlightened me. He said: Everyone has to eat and wear clothes every day. If all the farmers in the country abandon their land, where will the grain come from, and where will the cotton come from? These words of the branch secretary reminded me. Yes, developing agriculture is a glorious cause, and agricultural labor is glorious labor. How can one say that there is no promise or future in the countryside? From then on, I settled down, rooted myself, and vowed to work hard in the countryside for the rest of my life. For more than ten years, under the specific leadership of the Party and through the hard work of all commune members, our Fenghuo Commune has undergone earth-shaking changes. Due to the great development of production, the lives of the commune members have all caught up with the living standards of wealthy peasants. I myself, thanks to the Party's cultivation and my own subjective efforts, have achieved some success in agricultural experiments. The Party and the people have given me great honor and sent me to the Northwest Agricultural College for further studies. The facts further educated me that the cause of the Party and the people has infinite prospects. Listening to the Party and following Chairman Mao will lead to great achievements. Just as Chairman Mao pointed out: "The countryside is a vast world where there is much to be done."

    以农为乐，其乐无穷
    陕西乾县烽火公社　王保京
    在农村有这么一些知识青年，认为做庄稼活没出息，没前途。过去，我也曾有过这号瞎思想。虽说自己是在农村土生土长的穷孩子，解放初期在党的领导下刚翻了身，就不愿干农业活了。以后党支部书记对我进行了耐心的教导和启发，他说：人人每天都要吃饭穿衣，如果全国农民都丢下地不种，粮食从哪里来，棉花又从哪里来？支部书记这些话提醒了我。是啊，发展农业是光荣的事业，农业劳动是光荣的劳动，怎能说在农村没出息没前途呢？从那以后，我就安下心，扎下根，立志在农村大干一辈子。十年多来，在党的具体领导下，经过全体社员的辛勤努力，我们烽火公社已发生了翻天复地的变化。由于生产大发展，社员的生活已全部赶上了富裕农民的生活水平。我自己也由于党的培养和自己主观努力，在农业试验上搞出了一些成绩，党和人民给了我很大荣誉，并送我到西北农学院继续进行深造。事实进一步教育了我，党和人民的事业是前途无穷的，听党的话，跟着毛主席走，就会大有出息。正像毛主席所指出的：“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”
