Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 17th. The Ceylon Writers' Association held a tea party this evening to welcome Ding Xilin, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Yang Shuo, Director and Secretary-General of the Chinese Liaison Committee of the Asian-African Writers' Association, who are currently visiting Ceylon.

Prominent Ceylonese writers, poets, and artists attended the tea party. Zhang Canming, the Chinese Ambassador to Ceylon, also attended the tea party.

Martin Wickramasinghe, President of the Ceylon Writers' Association, praised the great enthusiasm and creativity shown by the Chinese people in the eleven years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. He said that Western countries "attempt to isolate China, but it is they themselves who are now being isolated."

In his reply, Ding Xilin said that cultural relations and friendly exchanges between Ceylon and China began more than two thousand years ago, and that these relations and exchanges have been further strengthened since the two countries gained national independence. He said that their visit to Ceylon was to learn from the culture of the Ceylonese people. He hoped that this cultural and friendly contact would further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries.

In the evening, Ding Xilin and Yang Shuo watched the Chinese opera "The White Haired Girl" performed by the Ceylon-China Friendship Association, with the entire opera performed in Sinhala.

    新华社科伦坡17日电　锡兰作家协会今晚举行茶会欢迎正在锡兰进行访问的中国人民对外文化协会副会长丁西林和理事、亚非作家协会中国联络委员会秘书长杨朔。
