Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 22nd:  Núñez Jiménez, director of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform of Cuba, revealed on the evening of the 21st that after the signs of failure in the economic aggression against Cuba adopted by U.S. imperialism, the United States is preparing to launch a military invasion of Cuba.

Jiménez made these remarks at the closing ceremony of the Third Conference of the International Trade Union Committee in Support of Algerian Workers and People, held here on behalf of the Cuban government.

Jiménez said that just minutes before, a large number of U.S. Marines arrived at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba, to strengthen the U.S. troops stationed there and to carry out shameless provocations against the Cuban Revolutionary Army and the people. Jiménez also said that U.S. military aircraft are being concentrated in Guatemala in order to invade Cuba from there, including eighteen aircraft that were transported to Guatemala from Puerto Rico the day before yesterday.

Jiménez emphasized that if U.S. troops invade Cuba, they will inevitably be defeated by the Revolutionary Army and the Revolutionary Militia. He said that every furrow will become a trench, every tractor will become a tank, every sugar mill will become a fortress, and every house will become a defensive fortification to defend sovereignty and drive out the invaders. Jiménez stressed that imperialism is a paper tiger.

Speaking of the support and assistance of all the Cuban people to the Algerian people who are bravely fighting for their independence, Jiménez said that despite the U.S. providing French colonialists with atomic bombs and U.S. aid, the Algerian patriotic struggle is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and it will persevere in the struggle and achieve victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 21st: The News Bureau of the Headquarters of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces announced today a communiqué regarding the arrest of an American, Major William Morgan, and another Cuban officer, Major Carrera, for participating in counter-revolutionary activities.

The communiqué stated, "The Revolutionary Government has learned that Major William Morgan and Major Jesús Carrera are connected to counter-revolutionaries serving foreign interests and attempting to establish armed groups in the Escambray Mountains, and are transporting weapons to this area."  The communiqué said that these two men also "concealed fleeing counter-revolutionaries and helped them evade the sanctions of the authorities, therefore investigators of the armed forces arrested them." The communiqué said that the Cuban Revolutionary Government believes that it has a responsibility to resolutely punish all acts of disloyalty and betrayal against it, has ordered a wide-ranging investigation into the actions of these two men, and will report the investigation to the Revolutionary Tribunal.

    希门尼斯揭露美国准备发动武装进攻
    古巴军民必将奋起击败侵略者
    古巴武装部队宣布逮捕参与反革命活动的一个美国少校
    新华社哈瓦那22日电　古巴土地改革全国委员会主任努?斯·希门尼斯21日晚上揭露说，在美帝国主义采取的反古巴的经济侵略出现失败的迹象以后，美国正在准备发动对古巴的军事侵略。
    希门尼斯是代表古巴政府在这里举行的国际工会支援阿尔及利亚工人及人民委员会第三次会议的闭幕会上讲这番话的。
    希门尼斯说，在几分钟前，大量的美国海军陆战队抵达古巴关塔那摩的美国海军基地，以便加强驻扎在那里的美国军队并且对古巴起义军和人民进行无耻的挑衅。希门尼斯还说，美国的军用飞机正在危地马拉集中，以便从那儿入侵古巴，其中有十八架飞机已经在前天从波多黎各运到了危地马拉。
    希门尼斯强调说，如果美国军队入侵古巴，它必将被起义军和革命民兵击败。他说，每一条田畦将变成战壕，每架拖拉机将变成坦克，每一个糖厂将变成要塞，每一幢房子将变成防御工事，以此来捍卫主权和驱逐侵略者。希门尼斯强调指出，帝国主义是一只纸老虎。
    希门尼斯在谈到全体古巴人民对为他们的独立而英勇地战斗着的阿尔及利亚人民的支持和援助时说，尽管美国给予法国殖民主义者以原子弹和美援，阿尔及利亚的爱国斗争正在深入人心，它将把斗争坚持下去和取得胜利。
    新华社哈瓦那21日电　古巴革命武装部队司令部新闻局今天公布了关于逮捕参加反革命活动一名美国人威廉·摩根少校和另一名古巴军官卡雷拉少校的公报。
    公报说，“革命政府得悉，威廉·摩根少校和赫苏斯·卡雷拉少校同为外国利益集团服务的、企图在埃斯坎布拉伊山区建立武装集团的反革命分子有联系，并向这个地区运送武器。”公报说，这两个人还“隐藏潜逃的反革命分子和帮助他们逃避当局的制裁，因此武装部队的调查人员逮捕了他们”。公报说，古巴革命政府认为，它有责任坚决制裁一切对它不忠和背叛的行为，已经下令广泛调查这两个人的行为，并把调查情况报告革命法庭。
