Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 16th - The 1960 National Weightlifting Championships opened in Jinan on the 15th. In the flyweight competition on the first day, three athletes reached the Master of Sports standard for the first time. The champion was Li Jiyuan from the People's Liberation Army, with a total score of 315 kilograms in the press, snatch, and clean and jerk.

    The rankings below the flyweight champion were: Chen Zaiming (Guangdong, 297.5 kg), Lai Shaoqi (Guangxi, 295 kg), Ye Haobo (Guangdong, 295 kg), Ning Lianting (Shandong, 292.5 kg), and Guo Yi (Fujian, 290 kg). Among them, newcomers Chen Zaiming, Ye Haobo, and veteran Guo Yi all reached the Master of Sports standard of 290 kg for the first time. Guo Yi won sixth place in the flyweight competition at the First National Games last year, but his total score at that time was only 280 kg.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 17th - The 1960 National Weightlifting Championships held the bantamweight competition on the 16th. The competition that day was very intense. The champion, You Jiadong from Inner Mongolia, had a total score of 325 kilograms, only 10 kilograms more than Cai Yanxin from the People's Liberation Army, who came in sixth.
    
    The second place in this category was Jiang Hongming from Shandong, with a total score of 320 kilograms; third place was Li Yilong from the People's Liberation Army, with a total score of 317.5 kilograms; fourth place Huang Ruiming from Guangdong and fifth place Chen Jiafu from Sichuan both achieved a total score of 315 kilograms. Among them, Jiang Hongming, Huang Ruiming, and Gu Zongxu from Anhui (total score of 312.5 kilograms, ranked seventh), who did not win a prize, all reached the Master of Sports standard of 310 kilograms in the bantamweight class for the first time.
    
    The total scores of the top six in this competition have generally improved compared with the total scores of the same rankings in the bantamweight class at the First National Games last year. The young You Jiadong also won the bantamweight championship at the National Games last year, but his total score at that time was only 317.5 kilograms. The total score of the sixth place this time is already equivalent to the level of the runner-up at the National Games. Jiang Hongming, the runner-up this time, has improved very quickly. When he participated in the National Weightlifting Individual Championship in June this year, his total score was only 287.5 kilograms. Thanks to his hard work and diligence, his total score increased by 32.5 kilograms after four months.

    全国举重锦标赛举行最轻量级和次轻量级比赛
    新华社济南16日电　1960年全国举重锦标赛15日在济南开幕。在第一天的最轻量级比赛中，有三名运动员第一次达到运动健将标准；获得冠军的是解放军选手黎纪元，他推举、抓举和挺举三项总成绩达到了三百一十五公斤。
    最轻量级冠军以下的名次是：广东陈载明（二九七·五公斤）、广西赖绍其（二九五公斤）、广东叶浩波（二九五公斤）、山东宁连廷（二九二·五公斤）、福建郭一（二九○公斤）。其中新手陈载明、叶浩波和老将郭一都是第一次达到二九○公斤的运动健将标准。郭一在去年第一届全国运动会最轻量级比赛中获得第六名，但那次他的总成绩只有二八○公斤。
    新华社济南17日电　1960年全国举重锦标赛在16日举行了次轻量级比赛。这天的比赛进行得十分紧张激烈，获得冠军的内蒙古选手尤家栋的总成绩是三百二十五公斤，只比第六名解放军选手蔡炎欣的总成绩多十公斤。
    获得这一等级第二名的是山东姜洪明，总成绩三百二十公斤；第三名解放军李奕龙，总成绩三百一十七点五公斤；第四名广东黄瑞明和第五名四川陈家富的总成绩也都达到了三百一十五公斤。其中姜洪明、黄瑞明和没有取上优胜名次的安徽顾宗旭（总成绩三百一十二点五公斤，列第七位）的总成绩，都是第一次达到次轻量级三百一十公斤的运动健将标准。
    这次前六名的总成绩同去年第一届全国运动会次轻量级同名次总成绩比较，有了普遍提高。年轻的尤家栋去年在全运会上也获得次轻量级冠军，但当时的总成绩只达到三百一十七点五公斤。这次第六名的总成绩，已相当于全运会亚军的水平。这次的亚军姜洪明的成绩提高非常快，他今年6月参加全国举重个人冠军赛时，总成绩只有二百八十七点五公斤，由于他勤学苦练，四个月后总成绩就提高了三十二点五公斤。
