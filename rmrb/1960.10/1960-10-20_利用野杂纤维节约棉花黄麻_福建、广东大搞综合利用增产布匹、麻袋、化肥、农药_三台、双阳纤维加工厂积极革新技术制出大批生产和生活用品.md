Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou – Fujian Province has achieved great success in the comprehensive utilization of wild fibers. From January to September this year, the province has used wild fibers to weave more than 360,000 meters of cloth, 980,000 sacks, and 2.82 million ropes. They have also successfully trial-produced fiberboard, pulp, and cardboard, strongly supporting industrial, agricultural, and fishery production while increasing commune income.

	The wild fiber processing plants, established by people's communes and commercial departments, actively mobilized the masses to offer suggestions and strategies, and vigorously promoted comprehensive utilization, turning the stems, leaves, branches, stalks, seeds, shells, kernels, and juices of various fiber plants into useful materials. The Minhou County Wild Plant Processing Plant utilized waste materials, waste gases, and waste liquids to produce more than 50 new products serving industrial and agricultural production. For example, after distilling oil and producing fiber from pine needles, they also produced various products such as phosphate and potash fertilizer, tannin extract, wood tar, and vinegar stone. At the same time, they also used wild fiber degumming water to produce a large amount of fertilizer. The Gongtian Commune Wild Fiber Processing Plant in Nan'an County discovered that many wild fiber plants contain oil or gum, and some even contain sugar or starch. During processing, they first extract oil, tannin, maltose, and starch, and then use the fiber to process various cloths, towels, and ropes. The leftover waste from the fiber is processed into various by-products according to its different properties, such as native paper, fiberboard, fertilizer, and pesticides. In the first nine months of this year, this commune increased its income by more than 120,000 yuan from the comprehensive utilization of wild fibers alone.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou – Guangdong Province has established 61 wild fiber processing plants (or workshops) using indigenous methods to comprehensively utilize wild fibers. From January to August this year, the province has used wild fibers to produce more than 1,500 pieces of substitute yarn and 1.7 million meters of substitute cloth, and 3.23 million sacks. From the waste materials and waste liquids of fiber processing, large amounts of tannin extract, fertilizers, pesticides, starch, and feed have been extracted. This not only supports industrial and agricultural production, but also increases the accumulation of communes and the income of commune members.

	These processing plants were all established based on the principle of "adapting to local conditions and starting with indigenous methods," manufacturing their own equipment. For example, the Tangkeng Weaving Factory and Tangxi Commune in Jieyang County used large oil drums converted into steam boilers for boiling and refining, and designed and manufactured fiber cutting machines, pressing machines, carding machines, and centrifuges, using water power to drive them, establishing a fiber degumming workshop.

	Various localities, following the principle of "if it can be fine, make it fine; if it can't be fine, make it coarse; if it can be worn, wear it; if it can't be worn, use it," vigorously promoted comprehensive utilization, so that various wild fibers could be fully utilized. For example, the Shantou Special District used wild fibers to spin 91 pieces of 6-10 count yarn, woven 130,000 meters of cloth, and made more than 100 sets of travel bags, small schoolbags, tablecloths, bed sheets, and work clothes, more than 180 fiber blankets, and more than 50,000 sacks.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu – Santai County in Sichuan Province has entered a new stage in the utilization of wild fiber plants, focusing on serving agriculture. They not only use wild fibers to make cotton fabrics, but also produce a variety of products such as fertilizers, pesticides, and feed.

	In recent months, Santai County has adopted the method of merging and consolidating, reorganizing the original hundreds of wild fiber factories and indigenous fertilizer factories into more than 100 comprehensive factories combining fertilizer production, cotton production, and paper production, comprehensively utilizing wild fiber plants to produce rayon, cloth, pulp, starch, feed, fertilizer, pesticides and other products, including more than 3 million catties of fertilizer alone, more than 1 million catties of rayon, and more than 140,000 meters of various cloths. After comprehensive utilization, the value of wild fiber plants has increased by more than tenfold, increasing the income of various communes by more than 1 million yuan.

	After the various communes established comprehensive wild fiber processing plants, equipment was concentrated, management was strengthened, labor was used rationally, and more than 300 people (accounting for about 25% of the original manpower) were saved and returned to the front line of agricultural production. The various communes, based on the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily and running enterprises diligently and thriftily, made do with whatever was available, combining indigenous and foreign methods to solve the equipment, raw materials, and technology problems of the processing plants. In establishing comprehensive processing plants, they did not add any special equipment, and only started production with ordinary pots, stoves, filter cloths, bamboo baskets, and wooden buckets. Many factories have adopted methods such as finding substitutes, recycling and reusing, and self-manufacturing and self-using to produce indigenous acids and indigenous alkalis in large quantities, using tung shell ash, grass ash, mirabilite, and lime to produce indigenous alkali, and using sulfur and copper sulfate to produce indigenous hydrochloric acid and indigenous sulfuric acid. Various factories have also carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements to improve product quality, save raw materials, and save labor. Most processing plants have achieved semi-mechanization in processes such as water use, beating, and carding.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun – Shuangyang County in Jilin Province has developed from making ropes to producing 12 kinds of products such as rayon, regenerated cotton, blended yarn, and blended cloth by processing and utilizing wild fibers.

	Since the beginning of this year, the county has used wild fibers to produce more than 3,000 dan of ropes, more than 500 chi of cloth, more than 100 dan of rayon and regenerated cotton, as well as a large number of pocket cloths, blankets, gloves, socks and other products. The ropes processed with wild fibers have strong tensile strength, are strong and durable, and have been supplied to Shixian Paper Mill for bundling, and to the county's agricultural production.

	Shuangyang County has very rich resources of wild fibers. According to preliminary surveys, there are more than 150 kinds that can be utilized. The annual output of only 13 kinds such as cattails, irises, and bindweed reaches about 40,000 dan. This year, the county, based on the principle of "minor tasks during busy farming seasons, major tasks during less busy seasons, suspension during extremely busy seasons, and a concentrated effort during slack farming seasons," appropriately arranged labor and adopted a combination of regular and concentrated methods to collect wild fibers. In order to achieve on-site processing, the commercial department piloted a wild fiber processing plant producing with indigenous methods, and trial-produced a large number of products with 72 kinds of wild fibers. The technical key to fully utilizing wild fibers is degumming. People's communes throughout the county generally use water immersion, lime boiling, alkali boiling, and sulfuric acid boiling to carry out rough degumming, and then transport them to the fiber processing plant for fine processing. The fiber processing plant created degumming machines, carding machines, and washing machines for mechanical degumming, which greatly improved work efficiency. (Attached picture)

	The staff of the commercial department of the Mutual Aid Tu Autonomous County in Qinghai Province has purchased more than 90,000 catties of wild plant fiber. This is the high-quality, high-tensile strength Langma bark fiber that has been processed.

    利用野杂纤维节约棉花黄麻
    福建、广东大搞综合利用增产布匹、麻袋、化肥、农药
    三台、双阳纤维加工厂积极革新技术制出大批生产和生活用品
    据新华社福州电　福建省各地综合利用野生纤维取得了很大成绩。今年1月至9月份，全省已利用野生纤维织布三十六万多米，麻袋九十八万多条，绳索二百八十二万多条，并且试制成功纤维板、纸浆、纸板等，有力地支援了工、农、渔业生产，同时增加了公社的收入。
    各地人民公社和商业部门兴办的野生纤维加工厂，积极发动群众献计献策，大搞综合利用，使各种纤维植物的茎、叶、枝、秆、籽、壳、仁、汁等都成为有用之物。闽侯县野生植物加工厂利用废料、废气、废液等，生产出五十来种为工农业生产服务的新产品。如他们用松针蒸油和制纤维后，还制出磷钾肥、栲胶、木焦油、醋石等多种产品；同时，还用野生纤维脱胶水制成了大批肥料。南安县公田公社野生纤维加工厂职工发现许多野生纤维植物含有油质或胶质，有的还含有糖分或淀粉，在加工时就先提炼出油、栲胶、饴糖、淀粉，然后利用它的纤维加工成各种布、毛巾、绳索；纤维的下脚废料也分别不同性质，加工成土纸、纤维板、肥料、农药等副产品。在今年的头9个月中，这个公社仅从综合利用野生纤维方面就增加了十二万多元的收入。
    据新华社广州电　广东省各地用土法建立了六十一个野杂纤维加工厂（或车间），综合利用野杂纤维。今年1至8月，全省已利用野杂纤维生产出代用纱一千五百多件，代用布一百七十万米，麻袋三百二十三万条；在加工纤维的废料、废液中，提取出大量的栲胶、化肥、农药、淀粉、饲料等。这不仅支援了工、农业生产，而且增加了公社的积累和社员的收入。
    这些加工厂都是根据“因地制宜、土法上马”的方针，自己制造设备建立起来的。如揭阳县汤坑织布厂和汤西公社，利用大油桶改制成煮炼用的蒸汽锅，自己设计、制造出切纤维机、压榨机、弹花机、离心机等，利用水力带动，建立起一个纤维脱胶车间。
    各地按照“能细则细，不能细则粗；能穿则穿，不能穿则用”的原则，大搞综合利用，使各种野杂纤维能得到充分利用。如汕头专区利用野杂纤维纺成六至十支纱九十一件，织成布十三万米，制成了旅行袋、小书包、枱布、床单布及工作服等一百多套，纤维毯一百八十多件，麻袋五万多条。
    据新华社成都电　四川省三台县对野生纤维植物的利用，进入了以服务农业为中心的新阶段。他们不仅利用野生纤维造棉织布，而且生产化肥、农药、饲料等多种产品。
    近几个月来，三台县采取合并、整顿的办法，把原有的几百个野生纤维厂和土化肥厂，改建成为一百多个造肥、造棉、造纸三结合的综合性工厂，综合利用野生纤维植物，生产了人造棉、布匹、纸浆、淀粉、饲料、肥料、农药等产品，其中仅肥料就有三百多万斤，人造棉一百多万斤，各种布十四万多米。野生纤维植物经过综合利用以后，其价值提高了十几倍，为各公社增加了一百多万元的收入。
  各公社大办综合性的野生纤维加工厂以后，设备集中，管理加强，劳力使用合理，节约出三百多人（占原有人力25％左右）回到农业生产第一线。各公社本着勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的精神，因陋就简，土洋并举，解决了加工厂的设备、原料、技术等各方面的问题。在建立综合加工厂时，都没有添置什么专门设备，仅用一般的锅灶、滤布、烧箕、木桶便开始了生产。许多工厂采取寻找代用品、回收重用、自制自用等办法，大造土酸、土碱，利用桐壳灰、草木灰、芒硝、石灰等制出了土碱，用硫磺，胆巴等制出了土盐酸、土硫酸。各工厂还开展技术革新和技术革命运动，以提高产品质量，节约原料，节约劳力。大部分加工厂已在用水、捶打、梳松等工序上实现了半机械化。
    据新华社长春电　吉林省双阳县加工利用野杂纤维，由制绳发展到生产人造棉、再生棉、混纺纱、混纺布等十二种产品。
    今年以来，全县已用野杂纤维生产绳索三千多担，布五百多尺，人造棉和再生棉一百多担，以及大量的口袋布、毯子、手套、袜子等产品。用野杂纤维加工的绳索拉力强，结实耐用，已供应一千五百多担给石岘造纸厂捆包用，供应九百五十多担给本县农业生产用。
    双阳县野杂纤维的资源十分丰富，据初步勘察，有一百五十多种可以利用。仅蒲草、马莲、拉拉秧等十三种，年产量即达四万担左右。今年，这个县本着“农事大忙小搞，小忙大搞，特忙暂停，农闲季节突击”的原则，适当安排劳力，采取经常与突击相结合的办法，采集野杂纤维。为了做到就地加工，商业部门试办了一个以土法生产的野杂纤维加工厂，用七十二种野杂纤维试制出大批产品。充分利用野杂纤维的技术关是脱胶。全县各人民公社普遍用水浸、石灰煮、碱煮、硫酸煮等办法进行粗脱胶，然后运到纤维加工厂精加工。纤维加工厂创造了脱胶机、梳打机、洗涤机，进行机械脱胶，大大提高了工效。（附图片）
    青海省互助土族自治县商业部门的职工已收购了野生植物纤维九万多斤。这是加工出来的质量高、拉力强的浪麻皮纤维
