Able to Write and Calculate with a Pen, Energetic and Vigorous in the Fields:
Qiao Jiguang Receives Praise After Two Months as a Farmer.
He says: The countryside is vast, like a huge swimming pool. If you have the ability, use all your strength to swim! Don't be afraid to create new records!

The Person Filling Out the Application to Join the Communist Youth League

We arrived just in time; Guo Guangmao, the Party Branch Secretary of the Shuixiu Management Area, and Guo Guanghou, the Communist Youth League Branch Secretary, were both at home. After we handed them the letter of introduction from Guo Zhenshan, the First Secretary of the Taigu County Committee in Shanxi Province, they both spoke almost simultaneously: "They're all good, more than thirty students in the entire management area have returned to their hometowns this year to participate in production, every single one of them. If you want to interview a typical example, talk to Qiao Jiguang!" As they spoke, they nodded toward a young man hunched over a table nearby. This young man had a purplish-red face, large eyes, and a sturdy build. He wore patched blue pants, a pair of cloth shoes with sturdy soles, and a black cloth jacket with the collar open. As a stranger, it would be impossible to imagine that just over two months ago, he was a third-year student at Taigu Middle School!

We walked up to him and looked at what he was doing. He was filling out an application to join the Communist Youth League. Name: Qiao Jiguang. Sex: Male. Family Background: Poor peasant. Current Education Level: Junior high school graduate. Native Place: Shuixiu Management Area, Hucun People's Commune, Taigu County, Shanxi Province. Current Occupation: Agricultural labor... In the "Personal Resume" section, he wrote "Graduated from elementary school in 1957, graduated from junior high school in 1960, returned to my hometown on August 17, 1960, to participate in agricultural production." The application also listed his achievements in receiving six awards during his three years of middle school. Guo Guangmao patted the young man's back and said, word by word: "A genuine farmer's son, he went away for three years and didn't forget his farm work. He works just like his father, without saying a word. He's made a name for himself in just over a month since he came back!" Guo Guanghou added: "That's right, all the young people in the Seventh Team say that Jiguang is a truly solid farmer!"

A few words made Qiao Jiguang's face turn completely red. Beads of sweat appeared on his nose. He said a little bashfully: "Secretary Guo, you're making too much of it. Actually, getting on this path took a lot of twists and turns."

The Missing College Application

What exactly were the twists and turns that Qiao Jiguang encountered in getting on this path? We only found out after talking to him for a whole afternoon. It all started with "the missing college application."

Back in July, the graduation exams for the graduating students of Taigu Middle School had already been held. The school gave each student a college application form and asked everyone to fill it out. The next day, the students handed in their forms. However, the teachers counted them and found that one was missing. Who had forgotten to hand it in? After careful investigation, it turned out to be Qiao Jiguang, a student in Class 41.

Qiao Jiguang didn't fill out the college application form, not because he forgot, but because he had decided after pondering it for a whole semester. Back at the beginning of the year, when school had just started, Qiao Jiguang was considering what to do after graduating from junior high school. He liked physics and chemistry and had thought about going to a chemical technology school; he also liked plants and had thought about going to an agricultural college. However, the Party's call to strengthen agricultural production and for young intellectuals to go to the front lines of production had stirred up new waves in his thinking. Later, whenever he thought about going to college, the Party's call, the production in his hometown, childhood friends..., kept crowding into his mind. One day, his class teacher asked him, and he told him his thoughts. The class teacher said at the time: "Your idea is good. However, you still have to think about it again. If you can't figure it out, you won't be able to do a good job even if you go back." These words opened up his thinking. He thought: "Yes! The reason I haven't been able to decide these days is that I'm afraid of this and afraid of that, thinking too much from a personal point of view!" In this way, he felt more at ease, and the idea of returning to the countryside gradually became firmer. When the college application form was handed out this time, he decided not to fill it out.

Life Began Like This

Since he had made up his mind to build the people's commune, the city could no longer keep him. On August 17, the graduation ceremony lasted until after eight o'clock in the evening. When he walked out of the auditorium, it was already so dark that he couldn't see the person in front of him. In order to return to his hometown as soon as possible, he said goodbye to his alma mater where he had lived for three years. He carried his luggage on his back and ran back in the dark.

The news of Qiao Jiguang returning to the countryside to settle down spread throughout the entire team early the next morning. At mealtime, production team leader Zhang Choumao ran into him in the canteen and said warmly: "Jiguang, you've had a great idea. Our team is good at everything, but there are too few educated people. With you back, production can be even better!" A group of young people also gathered around, asking all sorts of questions, vying for him to join their work group. Guo Kuizi, a close friend who had studied with him in elementary school, took his hand and said: "Jiguang, it's really great that you're back. If we work together, we're not afraid of turning the land upside down!" Some older people also discussed, saying: "Young people these days are different. They've studied for so many years and are still happy to come back to work!" Of course, some rural women couldn't understand and said some idle gossip, which affected Qiao Jiguang's mood. However, the Party's call, the principal's exhortation at the graduation ceremony, and the production team leader's words all flooded into his mind. It was as if someone was asking: "Are you wavering?" He suddenly raised his head and said to himself: "Listen to the Party's words and resolutely carry on, it's always right!"

On this day, he used all his strength. It was too hot, and when cutting grass in the sorghum field, he felt stuffy and sweaty, soaking his clothes. He took off his shirt, but the sorghum leaves scratched his arms with lines, so he put it back on. In this way, he cut from morning to noon, and from noon to sunset, cutting a full four carts, which he calculated to be more than eight hundred catties. As he pushed the last cart of grass back to the village, the evening glow was reddening the western sky. He looked at the bright evening glow, listened to the sounds of driving livestock on the village road, and couldn't help but mutter to himself: "Life began like this!"

Thirty Workdays in Thirty Days

Once he settled down, Qiao Jiguang buried himself in work. No matter what work the production team assigned him, he never said a word. Usually, he always got up earlier than others, went to bed later, and worked more. When cutting grass, a person usually cuts five or six hundred catties a day, but he can cut seven or eight hundred catties a day. Originally, the team called for making silage and wanted the commune members to carry out a carrying movement, taking a handful of grass when going to the field. In just over half a month, he cut more than two thousand catties. In early September, the production team wanted to use manure to fertilize the napa cabbage. In previous years, the cleaning and hauling of manure often couldn't keep up with the needs of the cabbage; this year, the team leader gave this task to Deputy Team Leader Yang Fushou, Qiao Jiguang, and Li Shengyi, one to clean, one to carry, and one to drive the cart. After accepting the task, Qiao Jiguang thought about it: Yang Fushou's arm had been injured in Korea, and Li Shengyi was old, so he took on the task of carrying the manure, letting Yang Fushou clean it and Li Shengyi drive the cart. Carrying manure is hard work. Not only must the manure be carried out of the toilet, but it must also be sent to the cart. Qiao Jiguang had never done it before. As soon as he started, he knocked the bottom of the manure bucket off, spilling manure all over himself. Old Man Li Shengyi said with a smile: "Young man, cleaning manure also needs to be learned!" Although Qiao Jiguang felt hot and spicy in his heart, he didn't say anything. He thought: The reason why the manure bucket hits the bottom when it's on the cart is mainly because the friction is too great. Wouldn't it be better if I sprinkled some water on the cart to make the board slippery? He tried it, and it worked, and the speed of loading the cart also increased. Old Man Li Shengyi was so happy that he kept praising, saying: "Studying wasn't for nothing!" In this way, he carried away all the manure that the deputy team leader cleaned out in a day and loaded it onto the cart. He did more than one workday a day by himself.

In mid-September, the team used two electric water pumps to water the fields. Jiguang also participated. Initially, each one was assigned three people. When Jiguang arrived in the fields, he felt that it wasn't necessary, so he said to Choumao: "Team leader, this watering is a job that requires patience, it's not heavy, two people are enough." The team leader listened to him and took one person from his group. Jiguang, on the other hand, always rested less and worked more. Twenty-four hours a day and night, the water pump only stopped for four hours. The electric water pump's belt was prone to slipping, so he improved the belt's device based on the principles of physics. Because of these reasons, although his electric water pump only had two people, it watered two more mu of land every day than the water pump with three people.

From August 18 to September 21, in the thirty-five days, Qiao Jiguang worked for thirty days, except for the time he spent moving his household registration from the county seat, transferring supplies, and other procedures. In these thirty days, he did forty workdays, and his labor efficiency was higher than that of all the young people in the Seventh Team. Now, some older people in the team always say this when educating their children: "Look at Qiao Jiguang, he can write and calculate with a pen, and he's energetic and vigorous in the fields."

In Qiao Jiguang's own words, if a person lives in the Mao Zedong era, you should be afraid of not having the ability, and not be afraid of not being able to use it. The countryside is vast, like a huge swimming pool. If you have the ability, use all your strength to swim! Don't be afraid to create new records!

    拿起笔能写会算　下了地生龙活虎
    乔继光当农民两个月受到称赞
    他说：农村的天地广大的很，像大游泳池，有本事就使尽力气游吧，还怕创造不出新纪录来！
    填写入团申请书的人
    来得正巧，水秀管理区的党支部书记郭光茂和团支部书记郭光厚都在家。我们把山西省太谷县委第一书记郭振山的介绍信，递给他们看了以后，两人几乎同时开了口：“行么，今年全管理区回乡参加生产的学生有三十多个，个个都行。要是想访问个典型，就和乔继光谈谈吧！”他们说着，向伏在旁边桌子上的一个小伙子点了点头。这个小伙子有一张紫膛色的脸皮，两只大眼，人长得挺结实，穿一条打补钉的蓝裤子，一双实纳帮的布鞋，黑布褂子敞开着领口。一个陌生人，怎么也想像不到：两个多月前他还是太谷中学的三年级学生哩！
    我们凑到他跟前看了看，他正在填写入团申请书。姓名：乔继光。性别：男。家庭出身：贫农。现有文化程度：初中毕业。籍贯：山西省太谷县胡村公社水秀管理区。现在职业：农业劳动……。在“本人简历”一栏中，他写着“1957年高小毕业，1960年初中毕业，1960年8月17日回乡参加农业生产。”申请书上还填写着他在三年中学生活中，连得六次奖励的事迹。郭光茂把一只手抚在这个年轻人的脊背上，一字一板地说：“地道的农家子弟，走了三年，没丢下农活。干起来像他老子，一声不吭。回来刚一个多月就叫响了！”郭光厚接上去说：“就是嘞，七队的年轻人谁不说继光是实打实的农民！”
    几句话，把乔继光说得满脸通红。鼻头上冒出了一层汗珠。他有点不大好意思地说：“郭支书看把我说成甚了？其实，走到这条道儿上来，还是费过好多周折哩。”
    找不到的升学志愿书
    乔继光走到这条道儿上，究竟费了些什么周折？和他整整谈了一下午，才弄清楚。这要从“找不到的升学志愿书”说起。
    还是在7月间，太谷中学应届毕业生的毕业考试已经举行完毕。学校给每个学生发了一份升学志愿书，要大家填写。第二天，学生们就把志愿书交了回来。可是老师们数来数去，却少一份。究竟谁忘了交？仔细一查，原来是四十一班的学生乔继光。
    乔继光没有填写升学志愿书，可不是忘了，是经过整整一个学期的琢磨才决定的。还在年初刚开学的时候，乔继光就考虑着初中毕业后干什么。他喜欢理化，想到过升化工技术学校；他也喜欢植物，也想到过升农业专科学校。可是，党的加强农业生产、青年知识分子到生产第一线的号召，在他的思想上引起了新的波澜。以后，每当他想到升学的时候，党的号召、家乡的生产、幼年时代的朋友……，就一个劲地往脑子里挤。一天，班主任问他，他才把自己的想法说出来。班主任当时就说：“你的想法好呵。不过，还要再想一想，想不通，回去也干不好。”这话打开了他的思路，心想：“是呀！这些天一直定不下来，就是怕这怕那，从个人考虑得多！”这么一来，心里也坦然了，回农村的想法也慢慢坚定下来。这次发下升学志愿书，他就决心不填了。
    生活就这样开始了
    既然立下了建设人民公社的志愿，城里就再也留不住他了。8月17日，毕业典礼一直开到下午八点多钟。他走出礼堂时，已经黑得对面看不见人，为了早日回到家乡，他还是告别了生活三年的母校。背上行李，摸黑跑回去了。
    乔继光回农村安家落户的事，第二天一早就传遍了全队。吃饭时，生产队长张丑卯在食堂碰上他，热乎乎地说：“继光，你可打了个好主意。咱这队，什么也好，就是有文化的人少，你回来，生产就能搞得更好啦！”一伙年轻人也围上来了，问长问短，争着要他参加他们的作业小组。在小学里一块念书的知心朋友郭奎子，拉着他的手说：“继光，你回来可真好，咱们一块干，怕不能把土地给它翻个个儿！”有些上了年岁的人，也议论说：“这会子的年轻人就不一样，念了那么多年书，还乐乐和和回来劳动！”当然，有些农村妇女想不通，也说了些闲话，影响到乔继光的情绪。但是，党的号召，校长在毕业典礼上的嘱咐，生产队长的话，都涌进了脑海。仿佛有人在问：“难道动摇了吗？”他陡地抬起头来，自己对自己说：“要听党的话，坚决地干下去，总没错！”
    这一天，他把全身的劲都用上了。天太热，在高粱地割草，闷得浑身淌汗，把衣服都湿透了。脱了上衣，高粱叶子又把胳膊划得一道一道的，于是又把它穿上了。就这么着，他从早晨割到晌午，从晌午割到太阳落山，整整割了四车，算了算，足有八百多斤。当他推着最后一车草走回村里的时候，晚霞正映红了西半天。他瞅着鲜艳的晚霞，听着村道上?喝牲口的声音，禁不住自言自语地说：“生活就这样开始了！”
    三十天做了四十个劳动日
    稳下心来，乔继光就埋头到劳动中去。生产队不论分配他什么活儿，他都没吭过声。平常，他总是比别人起得早，睡得晚，干得多。割草，一般一个人一天割五、六百斤，他一天能割七、八百斤。原来，队里号召打草储青，要社员们开展捎带运动，下地捎一把草。他半个多月，割了两千多斤。9月初，生产队要用粪肥奶白菜。往年，掏粪、拉粪的经常赶不上奶菜的用；今年，队长就把这个差事，交给了副队长杨福寿、乔继光和李生义，一个掏，一个担，一个赶车。接受任务后，乔继光一盘算：杨福寿的胳膊在朝鲜负过伤，李生义年龄大，就把担粪的任务包下来，让杨福寿掏，李生义赶车。担粪是个重活儿，不但要把粪从厕所担出来，还得送到大车上。乔继光没干过，一上手，就把粪桶底子给碰掉了，洒了一身大粪。李生义老汉笑着说：“年轻人，掏粪也得学哩！”乔继光心里虽然觉得热辣辣的，也没说什么。心想：粪桶上了车碰底子，主要是磨擦力太大，要是给车上洒点水，车板滑了，不就好些吗？他试了试，果然有效，装车速度也加快了。乐得李生义老汉不住地称赞说：“书是没有白念了！”就这样，副队长一天掏出来的粪，他都把它全部担走，装了车。一个人一天做了一个多劳动日。
    9月中旬，队里用两台电动水车浇地。继光也参加了。起初，一台配了三个人。继光到地里一看，觉得用不了，就和丑卯说：“队长，这浇地是个磨耐心的活儿，并不重，有两个人就行了。”队长听了他的话，就从他所在的那个组里抽走了一个人。继光呢，总是少休息，多工作。一昼夜二十四小时，水车只停四小时。电动水车的皮带容易滑脱，他就根据物理学的原理，改进了皮带的装置。因为这些缘故，他这台电动水车虽然只有两个人，但比三个人的那台水车，每天还多浇二亩来地。
    从8月18日到9月21日的三十五天中，乔继光除因为从县城迁户口、转供应和其他手续外，整整劳动了三十天。这三十天中，他就做了四十个劳动日，劳动效率比七队所有的年轻人都高。现在，队里一些老年人教育自己的子女时，总是这样说：“看人家乔继光，拿起笔来能写会算，下了地生龙活虎。”
    用乔继光自己的话说，一个人生活在毛泽东时代，就怕你没本事，还怕用不上？农村的天地广大的很，像大游泳池，有本事你就使尽力气游吧，还怕创造不出新纪录来！
