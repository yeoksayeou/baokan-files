    Grasp Forestry Tightly, Grasp Agriculture Ruthlessly
    ——The Experience of the Miao Autonomous County of Damaoshan in Guangxi in Achieving Grain Self-Sufficiency in Forest Areas
    By our reporter Gong Chenghua

Agriculture is the foundation of national economic development. Vigorously developing agriculture and grain production is the current task of the entire party and all the people. So, can forest areas vigorously develop agriculture and grain production? The facts from the Damaoshan forest area provide a good answer.

The Miao Autonomous County of Damaoshan in Guangxi, which is rich in Chinese fir, regards the development of forestry production and striving for grain self-sufficiency as two indispensable aspects of accelerating the development of the forest area economy. The result is increased timber production, and grain has changed from relying on external assistance to being self-sufficient with a surplus.

The Damaoshan Autonomous County has eighteen communes, of which eleven are mainly engaged in forestry, three are both grain and forestry, and only four communes are mainly engaged in grain. Before 1958, only four communes in the county could achieve grain self-sufficiency, and the rest were grain-deficient communes, so they had to rely on the state to transfer in about 20 million catties of grain every year. At that time, all of the county's more than 200 wooden boats had to be put into grain transportation in late winter and early spring. Because Damaoshan is located in a mountainous area with inconvenient transportation, in addition to boat transportation, more than 20,000 laborers had to be mobilized to carry grain. In the Gaohan Mountainous Gandong Commune, the labor force spent more than four months each year carrying grain. Because a large number of laborers were busy transporting grain to solve the problem of food, the labor force for forestry could not increase, which affected forest logging. The county party committee analyzed the above situation in the spring of 1958 and believed that simply transferring the labor force to the forestry front could temporarily increase timber production, but it would inevitably expand the non-agricultural population consuming grain. As a result, the number of people eating grain and transporting grain would increase, and the forestry labor force would still not increase. The solution to this problem is to vigorously develop grain production. Only by achieving grain self-sufficiency can labor be transferred to strengthen forestry production. At that time, the county party committee loudly proposed to the people of the county that the task for 1958 was: strive for grain self-sufficiency and achieve a double leap forward in timber and grain production.

Based on the investigation of the people's thinking, the CCP Damaoshan County Committee found that to achieve the above tasks, it was necessary to change some of the wrong perceptions of some cadres and the masses. For example, some people believed that wanting both trees and grain would inevitably lead to losing both; some believed that forest areas produce timber to support the country, and it is only natural for the country to transfer grain to forest areas; and so on. But to solve this problem, the masses must see the possibility that forest areas can both increase timber production and achieve grain self-sufficiency. Therefore, while proposing tasks, the responsible comrades of the county party committee went deep into the grassroots to summarize the experience of the double leap forward in grain and forestry, and educated the masses through vivid examples. During the investigation, the responsible comrades of the county party committee discovered that Jia Laofang, the Miao Party branch secretary of Rongtang Brigade of Xiangfen Commune, led the masses to adopt the method of combining agriculture and forestry and intercropping grain and forests. In 1957, the brigade changed from a historically grain-deficient team to a surplus grain team, and completed the annual timber production task half a month ahead of schedule, achieving a double harvest of grain and timber. As early as 1957, Jia Laofang saw the team going to pick up grain seventy miles away and calculated that it would take four workdays to carry one hundred catties of grain. He thought, "Why not use these laborers for grain production?" So, he divided the labor force into two groups, with two professional teams engaged in forestry and five production teams engaged in agriculture. When transplanting mid-season rice, he transferred all the people from the forestry team back to rush transplanting; at harvest time, he transferred the forestry team back to rush harvesting. Therefore, the entire team's 800 mu of mid-season rice fields kept up with the seasons from planting to harvesting, resulting in an increase of 10,000 catties of grain. This Party branch secretary, who came from a hired peasant background, based on his experience in helping landlords plant Chinese fir in the old society and planting miscellaneous grains in forest land to maintain his livelihood, led the masses to interplant 300 mu of sweet potatoes in the forest land in 1957, resulting in a harvest of 13,000 catties. Due to the adoption of the method of combining agriculture and forestry and intercropping grain and forests, the total land area of the team increased from 1,000 mu to 1,300 mu, and the grain yield increased by more than 28,000 catties compared to 1956, of which the grain obtained from grain-forest intercropping accounted for nearly half. After the autumn harvest ended and transitioned to the agricultural off-season, he drew 30% of the labor force from the agricultural team to invest in forestry production, and completed the annual timber production task in mid-December ahead of schedule, and cash income also increased.

The county party committee summarized the experience of this production team and launched a campaign to learn from, catch up with, and surpass Jia Laofang throughout the county, setting off a high tide of grasping forestry tightly and vigorously developing grain production. In 1958, more than 800 Jia Laofang-type cadres emerged throughout the county. Under the leadership of the county party committee, they worked hard and struggled, leading the masses to grasp both timber and grain, and tried every means to increase the yield of existing paddy fields, while also developing grain-forest intercropping in accordance with local conditions. In this year, the Damaoshan Autonomous County delivered a quarter more timber to the state than in 1957, achieved grain self-sufficiency for the first time, and also transferred more than 4.51 million catties of surplus grain.

Based on the mass movement of grasping both forestry and grain throughout the county, the county party committee, after continuous summarization, gradually gained the following leadership experience:

Combining agriculture and forestry is a correct measure to rationally use the labor force, adapting to the strong seasonality of forestry production. In Damaoshan, forestry production generally involves felling in autumn, pulling timber in winter, afforestation before the lunar new year, and rafting during the spring and summer river flooding season. Based on this characteristic, the county party committee has always fixed 15% of the total labor force in the county to focus on forestry, and the rest of the labor force is engaged in agriculture; when the forestry production season arrives, the labor force is transferred from the agricultural front to go up the mountains for a concentrated effort; during the busy agricultural season, the forestry team leaves a small number of people to maintain production, and the rest go down the mountain to support agriculture.

Grain-forest intercropping is a correct method of implementing high yield, multiple harvests, and multiple planting, based on the characteristics of forest areas. In the Damaoshan Autonomous County, the forest land area accounts for 46.17% of the total area of the county, the wasteland suitable for afforestation accounts for 20%, and the area of paddy fields accounts for about 4.7%. Therefore, to produce more grain, in addition to striving to increase the unit area yield of existing cultivated land, it is necessary to develop forest-grain intercropping and demand grain from forest land. They have also found a set of methods in this regard: 1. In the first year after timber is felled, the members of the forestry professional team combine clearing the forest area and plant grain on these lands in the coming spring. In this way, the members of the forestry professional team not only go down the mountain to support agriculture during the busy farming season, but also implement the policy of combining agriculture and forestry; 2. In the second spring, after going up the mountain to level the land and afforest, the members of the agricultural team plant cassava, sweet potatoes, taro, corn, etc. in the gaps between the young trees; 3. As the young trees gradually grow taller, in the third spring, the members of the agricultural team plant tall-stem crops such as cassava in the forest land, so that grain can be planted continuously for three years during the growing period of the young trees.

In the past two years, the Damaoshan Autonomous County has implemented the method of combining agriculture and forestry and intercropping grain and forests, and has achieved obvious results, realizing a double leap forward in forestry and grain.

    紧紧抓林业　狠狠抓农业
    ——广西大苗山苗族自治县实现林区粮食自给的经验
    本报记者　龚成华
    农业是国民经济发展的基础，大办农业、大办粮食，是当前全党全民的任务，那么林区能不能大办农业、大办粮食？大苗山林区的事实作了很好的回答。
    盛产杉木的广西大苗山苗族自治县，把发展林业生产和争取粮食自给作为加速发展林区经济不可缺少的两方面，结果是木材增产，粮食由依靠外援变成自给有余。
    大苗山自治县有十八个公社，其中以林业为主的有十一个，粮、林并重的有三个，以粮食为主的只有四个公社。1958年前，全县除了四个公社能够做到粮食自给，其余都是缺粮社，因此年年都要依靠国家调进两千万斤左右粮食。当时，全县二百多条木船，每当冬末春初就要全部投入运粮。由于大苗山内山峦起伏，交通不便，船运之外，还要出动两万多劳动力挑粮。在高寒山区的杆洞公社，劳动力用于挑粮的时间每年竟达四个多月。由于大批劳力忙于搬运粮食，解决吃饭问题，林业的劳动力也上不去，影响森林采伐。县委在1958年春天分析了上述情况，认为只是把劳动力调上林业战线，虽能一时增加木材产量，但是势必扩大非农业用粮的人口，其结果将造成吃粮、运粮的人增多，林业的劳动力还是上不去。解决这个问题的办法是大办粮食，只有实现粮食自给，才能抽调劳力加强林业生产。当时县委向全县群众响亮提出1958年的任务是：争取粮食自给，实现木材和粮食生产双跃进。
    中共大苗山县委会根据对群众思想的调查，发现要实现上述任务，必须改变部分干部和群众的一些错误认识，例如有的人认为要了树木还要粮食，到头一定是两头落空；有的认为林区生产木材支援国家，国家调粮食给林区是理所当然；等等。但是解决这个问题，必须让群众看到林区既能增产木材、又能粮食自给的可能性。因此，在提出任务的同时，县委负责同志就深入到基层总结粮、林双跃进的经验，通过生动的事例来教育群众。在调查中，县委负责同志发现香粉公社荣塘大队苗族党支书贾老芳，领导群众采取亦农亦林和粮林间作的办法，在1957年由历来缺粮队变成了余粮队，又提前半个月完成了全年木材生产任务，获得了粮食木材双丰收。早在1957年，贾老芳看到去七十里路以外挑粮的队伍，就计算起挑一百斤粮食要四个工。他想“为啥不把这些劳力用来搞粮食生产呢？”于是，他把劳力分成两摊子，两个专业队搞林业，五个生产队搞农业。在中稻插秧时，他把林业队的人马全部抽回，突击插秧；秋收时，照样把林业队抽回来搞抢收。因此，全队八百亩中稻田从种到收，都适时赶上了季节，结果增产了一万斤粮食。这个雇农出身的党支书，根据他在旧社会帮地主种杉木，在林地间种杂粮以维持生活的经验，在1957年又领导群众在林地里间种了三百亩?子，结果收获了一万三千斤。由于采取亦农亦林和粮林间作的办法，全队土地由一千亩增加到一千三百亩，粮食产量比1956年增产二万八千多斤，其中粮林间作拿到的粮食就接近一半。秋收结束转入农闲以后，他又从农业队抽出30％的劳动力投入林业生产，在12月中旬就提前完成了全年木材生产任务，现金收入也增加了。
    县委总结了这个生产队的经验，在全县开展了学、赶、超贾老芳运动，掀起了紧紧抓林业、狠狠办粮食的高潮。1958年，全县涌现出了八百多个贾老芳类型的干部，他们在县委领导下，发愤图强、艰苦奋斗，率领群众既抓木材又抓粮食，千方百计提高现有水稻田的产量，同时因时因地制宜大搞粮林间种。这一年，大苗山自治县交给国家的木材比1957年增加四分之一，第一次实现了粮食自给，同时还外调余粮四百五十一万多斤。
    在全县林、粮一齐抓，大闹群众运动的基础上，县委经过不断总结，逐渐摸索到以下几项领导经验：
    亦农亦林，是适应林业生产季节性较强而采取的合理使用劳动力的一项正确措施。大苗山的林业生产一般都是秋季砍伐，冬季拉材，旧历年前造林，春夏江河涨水放筏。县委根据这个特点，常年固定占全县总劳动力15％的劳动力以林业为主，其余的劳动力都搞农业；林业生产季节一到，就从农业战线抽调劳动力上山突击；农忙季节，林业队除留少数人坚持生产，其余的人下山支援农业。
    粮林间作，是根据林区特点贯彻高产多收与多种多收的一个正确方法。大苗山自治县林地面积占全县总面积46.17％，可造林的荒地占20％，水旱田面积约占4.7％。因此，要多产粮食，除了努力提高现有耕地的单位面积产量以外，必须发展林、粮间作，向林地要粮。他们在这方面也摸出了一套办法：一、木材砍后的头一年，林业专业队的社员结合清理林区，来年春就在这些地上种下粮食。这样就使林业专业队的社员不仅在农忙时下山支援农业，本身也贯彻了亦农亦林的方针；二、农业队的社员在第二年春天继前冬上山整地造林后，就在幼林间隙种上木薯、甘薯、芋头、玉米等；三、随着幼林逐渐长高，搞农业的社员在第三年春天就在林地间种高秆作物木薯，这样就能在幼林生长期连续三年种粮食。
    大苗山自治县两年来实行亦农亦林和粮林间作的办法，已收到了明显的效果，实现了林粮双跃进。
