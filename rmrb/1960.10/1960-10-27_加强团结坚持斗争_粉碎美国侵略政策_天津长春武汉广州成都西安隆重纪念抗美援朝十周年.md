Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 26th: More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Tianjin held a meeting on the 25th to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea.

Li Ziguang, Standing Committee Member of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wang Kangzhi, Standing Committee Member of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Meng Qingshan, Deputy Commander of the Hebei Military Region, and other responsible persons of the province and city's Party, government, military, CPPCC, democratic parties, people's organizations, and former Volunteer Army combat hero Wang Yougen, Yang Yu?, father of the former Volunteer Army hero and martyr Yang Lian, attended the meeting.

Gao Shuxun, Chairman of the Hebei Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke. He said that today, reviewing the historical experience of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea has very important practical significance. The great victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea proved that: US imperialism is a paper tiger, and the myth that US imperialism cannot be touched or defeated has been completely shattered. Gao Shuxun concluded by saying that when imperialism imposes war on the people, peace-loving people can only resolutely raise the banner of anti-aggression and defeat the aggressors to stop aggression and defend national independence and world peace.

After Gao Shuxun sternly condemned US imperialism for consistently undermining the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, obstructing the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and occupying China's territory of Taiwan, he said that the actions of US imperialism have confirmed that its aggressive nature will never change. We must continue to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, continue to strengthen the unity of the people of the world, and fight against imperialist aggression and for the defense of world peace. After the meeting, films such as "On the 38th Parallel" were shown.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 26th: More than 1,800 people from all walks of life in Jilin Province and Changchun City solemnly gathered on the evening of the 25th to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea.

Fu Zhensheng, Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and President of the Jilin Branch of the China-Korea Friendship Association, Zhou Guang, Vice Governor of Jilin Province, Luo Kunshan, Commander of the Jilin Military Region, Zhu Shihuan, Deputy Political Commissar, Song Zhenting, Wang Mingde, and Zhou Jiewen, Vice Presidents of the Jilin Branch of the China-Korea Friendship Association, and responsible persons of Changchun City, as well as responsible persons of the province and city's democratic parties and people's organizations, attended the commemoration.

Zheng Fenggui, Consul General of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Changchun, and personnel from the Consulate General were invited to attend the commemorative meeting.

Fu Zhensheng spoke at the meeting. He said: China and North Korea are brothers as close as lips and teeth. The incomparably profound combat friendship formed between the people of the two countries in the Anti-Japanese War and the great War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea is unbreakable. The Chinese people firmly believe that with the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people of all countries in the world, the heroic Korean people will surely achieve final victory, realize the desire for peaceful reunification of their motherland, and drive US imperialism out of South Korea.

Zheng Fenggui, Consul General of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Changchun, said at the meeting: The Chinese people's great movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea marks the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards the Korean people and has become a model of proletarian internationalism. He pointed out that US imperialism is doing everything possible to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, still lingers in the southern half of Korea, and is also entrenched in China's territory of Taiwan, frantically carrying out new military provocations, which is absolutely intolerable. US imperialism must get out of South Korea and get out of China's territory of Taiwan.

Zeng Dun strongly condemned US imperialism for continuing to linger in South Korea and carry out aggressive activities after the Korean Armistice. He pointed out: "US imperialism has not only not abandoned its evil policy of re-obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, but has also never given up its conspiracy to re-launch a war of aggression. US imperialism is not only the deadly enemy of peace in Korea, but also the source of tension in Asia and the vicious enemy of world peace." He said that the people of Hubei Province, like the people of the whole country, maintain a high degree of vigilance against the war conspiracies of US imperialism. Zeng Dun emphasized that the combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, forged with blood, is a great friendship built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. The people of China and North Korea will unite more closely in the future, strengthen the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and continue to wage a resolute struggle against the war policy and aggression policy of US imperialism.

Meng Futang, Vice Governor of Hubei Province, and other Party and government leaders of Hubei Province and Wuhan City, former Volunteer Army personnel, and people from all walks of life, totaling more than 1,300 people, also attended the commemoration.

Korean friend Kim Kwang-sun was invited to attend the meeting.

Vice Governor Lin Qiangyun spoke at the meeting. He said that the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people in resisting the US aggressors is not only a victory for the Chinese and Korean people in defending their homes and countries, but also a victory for the world's peace cause. It shows that the world's number one enemy—US imperialism—can be defeated. Lin Qiangyun said that we firmly believe that the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely achieve final victory. Korean friend Kim Kwang-sun spoke at the meeting. He said that the traditional friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples has been further strengthened and developed in the common struggle against US aggression. We will never forget the deep friendship and help of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers to the Korean people. After Kim Kwang-sun exposed the aggressive crimes of US imperialism, he said that we must force US imperialism to withdraw from Korea and withdraw from Taiwan.

Representatives of consulates and commercial agencies of socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland, and Vietnam in Guangzhou, as well as Korean interns in Guangzhou, were invited to attend the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 26th: People from all walks of life in Sichuan Province and Chengdu City solemnly gathered on the afternoon of the 25th to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea.

More than 1,000 people, including responsible persons from the province and city's governments, CPPCC, democratic parties, people's organizations, and PLA troops stationed in Chengdu, attended the meeting. Deng Fangzhi, mother of the former Volunteer Army Special-Class Hero Huang Jiguang, came from Zhongjiang County to attend the meeting.

Kang Naier, Vice Governor of Sichuan Province and Vice Chairman of the Sichuan Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting. After expounding the great significance of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war to defeat the US aggressors together with the Korean people, he said that in order to effectively defend socialism, safeguard national independence, and defend world peace, we must wage a tit-for-tat struggle against the aggressive acts and war crimes of US imperialism.

Kang Naier said: US imperialism has become the most vicious enemy of the people all over the world. At present, it is adhering to a policy of antagonism towards the people of the world and intensifying its aggressive activities around the world. We believe that as long as the Chinese and Korean people are with the people of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and with all peace-loving people in the world, strengthen unity, persist in struggle, Taiwan will surely be liberated, the peaceful reunification of Korea will surely be realized, and peace in the Far East and the world will surely be guaranteed.

Kang Naier concluded by saying: We will always unite closely with the Korean people, support each other, help each other, learn from each other, and strive to make greater contributions to strengthening the unity of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and developing our common cause.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 26th: People from all walks of life in Xi'an solemnly held a celebration meeting last night to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea.

Zhao Boping, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Shaanxi Province, Yang Jiarui, Commander of the Shaanxi Military Region, and other Party, government, military, democratic parties, and responsible persons of local organizations of people's organizations attended the meeting.

More than 1,800 people attended the meeting and listened to the speech of Chang Lifu, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman of the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace.

In his speech, Chang Lifu first pointed out that the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people in resisting the US aggressors completely shattered the US imperialist's evil plan to annex Korea and attack China. The historical experience of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea fully shows that when imperialism and all reactionaries impose war on the people, only by relying on the people to fight can aggression be stopped and peace be defended.

Chang Lifu said that as we commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, we are pleased to see that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong, the forces of peace are flourishing, and imperialism is full of internal contradictions and is at the end of its rope. We believe that as long as the people of the world unite and fight resolutely, they will surely be able to defeat the war policy and aggression policy of US imperialism.
