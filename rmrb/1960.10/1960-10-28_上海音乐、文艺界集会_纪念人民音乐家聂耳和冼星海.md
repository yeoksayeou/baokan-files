Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th - Shanghai people's activities to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the death of our great people's musician Nie Er and the 15th anniversary of the death of Xian Xinghai began on the 26th. This activity includes a memorial meeting, a concert, a symposium, and a photo exhibition, and will continue for six days.

　　At the memorial meeting held on the evening of the 26th, attended by more than 3,000 people from Shanghai's music, art, and amateur music lovers circles, Chen Qi-wu, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke. He pointed out that the direction pointed out by Nie Er and Xian Xinghai is the direction of China's new music, that is, the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the revolution proposed by the Party and Chairman Mao. The road they took is the road of an intellectual who, under the education of the Party and in the revolutionary struggle, constantly transforms himself into a proletarian revolutionary fighter, and the road of a revolutionary musician.

　　Meng Bo, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture, made a report at the meeting entitled "Inheriting and Carrying Forward the Revolutionary Music Tradition of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, and Creating New Music Worthy of the Great Era."

　　After the memorial meeting, a grand memorial concert was held with nearly 600 performers. The Shanghai Conservatory of Music, the National Orchestra, the Shanghai Putuo District Workers' Amateur Art Troupe, the Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace Red Children Art Troupe, and the Jiangnan Shipyard and other workers' amateur choirs jointly sang more than ten mass songs by Nie Er such as "March of the Volunteers," "Dock Workers," and "The Road Song." The Shanghai Chorus and the Broadcasting and Television Art Troupe, etc., performed Xian Xinghai's soul-stirring "Yellow River Cantata."

　　The photo exhibition in the memorial activities has nearly two hundred pictures, which vividly and systematically show people the life deeds of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai and the revolutionary roads they have experienced. The exhibition also introduced the brilliant achievements made by Shanghai music workers in the past eleven years since liberation, under the education of the Party and Chairman Mao, along the revolutionary music road of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai.

　　The Shanghai Experimental Opera House and the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra will respectively perform Nie Er's "Storm on the Yangtze River," China's first opera praising dock workers for carrying out a resolute struggle against imperialism under the leadership of the Party, and Xian Xinghai's "First Symphony," which reflects the national people's desire for national liberation on the eve of the Anti-Japanese War.
