Xinhua News Agency, New York, 6th - The United Nations General Assembly plenary session continued its general political debate on the 4th and 5th. The meeting also discussed the proposal put forward by Indonesia and four other countries requesting the leaders of the Soviet and American governments to make contact.

    The head of the Ukrainian delegation, Podgorny, speaking first at the General Assembly on the 4th, pointed out that Western countries have been using negotiations on disarmament as a smokescreen to cover up their policies, which are the opposite of disarmament. He said that the US government's policy is based on maintaining atomic and hydrogen weapons as weapons of aggression. Podgorny stressed that if the aggressors dare to launch a war of aggression, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries possess all the necessary means to crush any aggression in the aggressors' own lairs.
    The head of the Ukrainian delegation emphasized that the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic cannot tolerate the undermining of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.
    The head of the Moroccan delegation, Moulay Hassan, demanded that France stop its colonial war in Algeria. He expressed his belief that the Algerian people will eventually gain their independence.
    The Moroccan representative demanded that the General Assembly realistically discuss the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.
    In his speech, Dutch Foreign Minister Luns attacked Indonesia regarding President Sukarno's speech at the General Assembly. He described the Indonesian people's insistence on recovering West Irian, which was forcibly occupied by Dutch imperialism, as a "territorial claim." He clamored for the people of West Irian to exercise so-called "self-determination" to decide whether they were willing to establish an "independent state."
    At the plenary session on the 5th, Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio spoke and denounced Luns's imperialist clichés.
    He exposed Luns's conspiracy regarding "self-determination" for West Irian, pointing out that attempts to split a new country are always carried out under the guise of so-called "self-determination." He also condemned Dutch colonialists for creating divisions in Java and Sumatra in Indonesia and supporting the rebellion of the so-called "Republic of South Maluku."
    The Belarusian representative, Mazurov, condemned Western countries for sabotaging disarmament negotiations and demanded an end to the evil rule of colonialism.
    Australian Prime Minister Menzies and Philippine representative Delgado acted as lackeys of imperialism in their speeches, doing their utmost to defend the interests of imperialism. Menzies absurdly accused the Soviet Union of being responsible for the Cold War and slandered the People's Republic of China, saying that the direct threat in the Pacific region "comes from Communist China."
    The plenary session on the 5th also discussed the proposal put forward by Indonesia, India, the United Arab Republic, Ghana, and Yugoslavia requesting the leaders of the Soviet and American governments to make contact, and the amendment to this proposal put forward by Australia. The Australian amendment advocated changing the contact between the Soviet and American heads of government in the five-nation proposal to a summit meeting of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, and attempted to shift the responsibility for the failure of the Paris Conference onto the Soviet Union. The meeting rejected the Australian amendment by a vote of forty-five to five (Australia, the United States, Britain, France, Canada) with forty-four abstentions. Then the Argentine representative requested a separate vote on the words "(United States) President and (Soviet) Chairman of the Council of Ministers" in the five-nation proposal. US Secretary of State Herter spoke in support of the Argentine proposal, opposing the request for contact between the leaders of the Soviet and American governments. He argued that it would be best to use the names of the two governments rather than individuals in the resolution.
    Representatives from India, Afghanistan, and Nepal, among others, emphasized in their speeches that if the words "President" and "Chairman of the Council of Ministers" were deleted from the resolution, then the resolution would be meaningless. Moreover, it would be absurd to have the two governments make contact, because this would mean that contact between the two countries had stopped, while in reality, diplomatic relations were maintained between the two countries.
    Forty-one delegations (India, Indonesia, Afghanistan, UAR, Guinea, Ghana, Cuba, etc.) voted in favor of retaining the words "President" and "Chairman of the Council of Ministers" in the proposal, thirty-seven delegations (the United States, Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, etc.) voted in favor of deletion, and seventeen delegations (socialist countries, Austria, Tunisia, etc.) abstained.
    The Chairman of the General Assembly, disregarding procedural rules, arbitrarily announced that the words American President and Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers were deleted from the proposal, because the vote to retain them did not reach two-thirds.
    Then, Prime Minister Nehru, on behalf of the five proposing countries, announced that the emasculated proposal completely distorted its original meaning. He said that they could not support such a proposal and requested its withdrawal.
    The evening session of the General Assembly then adjourned.

    联大全体会议继续一般性辩论
    据新华社6日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议4日和5日继续进行一般性政治辩论。会议还讨论了印度尼西亚等五国提出的要求苏美两国政府首脑进行接触的提案。
    乌克兰代表团团长波德戈尔内在4日大会上首先发言，他指出，西方国家一直在利用谈判裁军作幌子掩饰它们同裁军相反的政策。他说，美国政府的政策是建立在保持原子武器和氢武器作为侵略武器的基础上的。波德戈尔内强调指出，如果侵略者敢于发动侵略战争，苏联和其他社会主义国家拥有一切必要的手段在侵略者自己的巢穴里粉碎任何侵略。
    乌克兰代表团团长着重指出，乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国决不能容忍破坏中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。
    摩洛哥代表团团长穆莱·哈桑要求法国停止在阿尔及利亚的殖民战争。他表示相信阿尔及利亚人民终将获得自己的独立。
    摩洛哥代表要求大会现实地讨论关于恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利的问题。
    荷兰外交大臣伦斯在发言中就印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在大会上的发言对印度尼西亚进行攻击。他把印度尼西亚人民坚持收复被荷兰帝国主义强占的西伊里安的权利说成是“领土要求”。他叫嚷要让西伊里安人民实行所谓“自决”，以便决定他们是否愿意建立一个“独立的国家”。
    在5日举行的全体会议上印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约发言痛斥伦斯的帝国主义滥调。
    他揭穿了伦斯的关于要西伊里安“自决”的阴谋，他指出，分裂一个新国家的企图总是在所谓“自决”的幌子掩盖下进行的。他还谴责荷兰殖民主义者在印度尼西亚的爪哇、苏门答腊制造分裂和支持所谓“南摩麓加共和国”的叛乱。
    白俄罗斯代表马祖罗夫谴责西方国家破坏裁军谈判，要求结束殖民主义的罪恶统治。
    澳大利亚总理孟席斯和菲律宾代表戴尔加多在发言时充当帝国主义的走卒，竭力维护帝国主义的利益。孟席斯荒唐地诬指苏联要对冷战负责，并且诬蔑中华人民共和国，说太平洋地区的直接威胁“来自共产党中国”。
    在5日的全体会议上还讨论了印度尼西亚、印度、阿拉伯联合共和国、加纳和南斯拉夫五国提出的要求苏美两国首脑进行接触的提案和澳大利亚对这项提案提出的修正案，澳大利亚的修正案主张把五国提案中苏美两国政府首脑接触改为苏、美、英、法四国举行首脑会议，并且企图把巴黎会议未开成的责任推到苏联身上。会议以四十五票对五票（澳、美、英、法、加拿大）、四十四票弃权否决了澳大利亚的修正案。接着阿根廷代表又要求对五国提案中的“（美国）总统和（苏联）部长会议主席”两词单独进行表决。美国国务卿赫脱发言支持阿根廷提案，反对要求苏美两国政府首脑进行接触。他主张在决议中最好是不用个人而用两国政府的名义。
    印度、阿富汗和尼泊尔等国代表在发言中着重指出，如果把“总统”和“部长会议主席”的字样从决议中删去，那么这个决议就没有意思了。而且要两国政府进行接触将是荒唐的，因为这意味着两国间的接触已经停止，而这两个国家之间实际上却保持着外交关系。
    四十一个（印度、印尼、阿富汗、阿联、几内亚、加纳、古巴等国）代表团投票赞成在提案中保留“总统”和“部长会议主席”的字样，赞成删除的有三十七个代表团（美、英、法、西班牙、葡萄牙、卢森堡等国），弃权的有十七个代表团（社会主义国家、奥地利、突尼斯等国）。
    大会主席不顾程序规章擅自宣布，把美国总统和苏联部长会议主席的字样从提案中删除去，因为投票保留的不到三分之二。
    接着尼赫鲁总理以五国提案提出国的名义宣布，被阉割的提案完全歪曲了它原来的意思。他说，他们不能支持这样的提案，并要求撤销它。
    联大晚上会议至此结束。
