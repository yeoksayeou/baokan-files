    Jiahe Ferry Crossing
    Zhang Xianglin
    Several comrades from our art troupe were heading towards Jiahe Ferry in the morning mist, ready to take the ferry to the Menlou Commune on the other side of the river.

    It was a beautiful morning, the air was very fresh. The wind blowing from the river carried the coolness of mid-autumn; according to the season, it was the good time for autumn sowing. The sounds of chanting and shouting came from the west bank, where people from the Chutang Commune were developing the slopes, rushing to sow early wheat.

    Ahead was Jiahe, flowing calmly like a wide jade belt. At this time, the mist on the river gradually dissipated, and the scenery on the opposite bank became clearer and clearer. Amidst the green, the rows of houses were our destination, a red flag fluttering in the wind, wasn't that Menlou Elementary School!

    The ferry boat didn't come, I was getting anxious. I looked around at the passengers waiting on the shore, students, workers, and government cadres. Sitting on the ground beside me was an old worker, nearly fifty years old. His face was ruddy, he was tall and strong, and his eyes were bright, giving people a feeling of determination. He seemed very anxious, rubbing his large hands together, and constantly looking back the way he came. Beside him was a hard-shell briefcase.

    I struck up a conversation with him. Sure enough, like us, he was also from the city to support agriculture. With the same purpose, we became very friendly, and our conversation flowed. The old man was talkative and cheerful.

    He told me that he was the leader of a large team at the city's machine repair factory. There were three people in his family: his wife, and a daughter who worked as a lathe operator at the farm tool factory. His daughter was very capable and received commendation certificates every month; he loved her very much. His daughter lived in the factory dormitory, living a collective life. Today was Sunday, and she must have gone home again. He believed that no one would complain about him, his daughter was sensible and knew that her father would be happy to support agriculture. I wished him well for having such a good daughter. He laughed heartily, and told me that their factory had been linked with the Chutang Commune since last year, and he was always involved in going to the countryside; helping farmers install steel grinders, repair water pumps, and repair portable steam engines... He said humorously, "These are relatives of our factory, if we don't come for a long time, they'll miss us." As he spoke, he laughed, his little mustache twitching. Then, after looking at me for a while, he asked with a smile, "Comrade Zhang, you're carrying a huqin to support agriculture, you must be from the opera troupe, right?"

    "We are an art troupe. We have people from the opera troupe, the art gallery, and the ballad troupe. We work in the fields with the commune members, and publicize on the spot during breaks, writing, acting, performing, and singing."

    "That's a good idea, the commune members will surely welcome it," the old man said with a smile, "When they are tired of working, listening to songs and watching plays, fatigue is swept away, and energy is boosted again. You really know how to leap forward!"

    The sun finally jumped out, it was red and round like a big fireball. The sky was flooded with rosy clouds, the river was receiving the sunlight, sparkling, golden and scaly, what a beautiful morning!

    The old man raised his head, using his hard-shell briefcase as a visor to look towards the opposite bank, and turned to me and said, "The ferryman probably forgot about us."

    "Maybe there are a lot of passengers over there too," I replied. For a moment, I thought: wasn't he supporting the Chutang Commune on the west bank? Why was he going to the east bank, and what was in the briefcase? So I asked him.

    "Going to learn a lesson!" he said, "Yesterday our Team Leader Yao from Chutang Commune visited the east bank and said that a female worker from a factory, supporting the Menlou Commune on the east bank, came up with a clever method that increased the efficiency of the water pump threefold. Last night I insisted on going to take a look. Team Leader Yao said that it was not safe to cross the river in the dark, and insisted on waiting until today. That's why I brought the briefcase to draw diagrams!"

    At this time, a person ran to the shore, shouting loudly: "Master Ren! Master Ren!"

    "Team Leader Yao is here," he said.

    The person ran up to him, his head covered in sweat, and after catching his breath he complained, "Ah, why didn't you call me when you left!" Team Leader Yao turned to me and said, "You see, as soon as he heard that the water pump in Menlou was efficient, he insisted that our Chutang catch up overnight. That's why he went to learn the lesson early in the morning before even swallowing a bite of food..."

    Without knowing when, the ferry boat was steadily rocking towards this side. The people on the shore looked towards the river in unison, the boat was getting closer and closer.

    Master Ren and Team Leader Yao stood side by side, staring at the ferry boat, as if they would jump up as soon as the boat docked.

    Everything on the boat could be seen clearly, a young girl was sitting at the bow of the boat, behind her was a middle-aged man in his forties, clusters of white waves were opening at the bow of the boat.

    Master Ren wiped his eyes, as if he had discovered something new, and suddenly opened his arms and shouted with a smile: "Shuying—".

    The girl on the boat also responded happily: "Dad, why are you here?"

    "Dad came to support agriculture, didn't you go home?"

    "We also came to support agriculture, we've been in Menlou for two days." The person on the boat jumped down, and the girl Shuying walked to her father like a swallow, leaning on him affectionately, a pair of black eyes sparkling: "Dad, are you crossing the river?..."

    "Are they father and daughter?" the middle-aged man asked.

    "Yes!" Team Leader Yao suddenly jumped up in realization and ran to Master Ren and said: "We don't need to go to learn the lesson, Menlou sent someone to our door, the inventor is your daughter! My good uncle, how interesting!"

    "Shuying, it's you?"

    "Dad!"

    "Dad is here to learn a lesson from you!" The old man said in a loud voice: "Did you bring all the blueprints? Let's go, don't cross the river, go back to Chutang!"

    Looking at the scene in front of them, those waiting to cross forgot to board the boat, and the ferryman forgot to row. This was a small thing in life, but it excited everyone at the ferry crossing.

    The ferry boat started moving, people on the shore and on the boat shouted "Goodbye!" The sun's golden rays shone on the beautiful mountains and rivers, the sky was bluer, the water was clearer, the mountains were higher, and the people were more beautiful...

    夹河渡口
    张相林
    我们文艺服务队的几个同志，在晨雾中，沿着田野小径，正向夹河渡口赶去，准备从那里搭上摆渡船，到河对岸的门楼公社。
    这是一个美好的早晨，空气很清新。河里吹来的风，夹带着仲秋的凉意；按节令，正是秋播的好时光。耳边传来的号子声、?喝声是河西岸楚塘公社的人马向坡地里开发，他们正抢播早茬麦。
    前面就是夹河，她平静地流着，像条宽宽的玉带。这时，河上的雾气渐渐消散，对岸的景物也由隐约变得清晰了。万绿丛中，房屋栉比处就是我们的目的地，一杆红旗迎风飘荡，那不是门楼小学吗！
    摆渡船不见来，心里好焦急。我环视岸上待渡的客人，看装束有学生，有工人，也有机关干部。在我身边席地而坐的，是一个年近五十的老工人。他脸膛红润，个子高大，目光炯炯，给人一种坚毅的感觉。看样子他很着急，两只大手相对搓着，不时回头向来路张望，他身边放着一个硬壳夹子。
    我和他搭讪起来。果然，他和我们一样，也是从市里来支援农业的。目的相同，彼此很亲热，话也稠起来。老人健谈，性格也满开朗。
    他告诉我：他是市里机器修配厂的大组长，家里三口人，老伴，还有一个在农具厂作车工的女儿。女儿很能干，月月都能得张奖状回来，他很爱她。女儿在厂里住宿舍，过集体生活。今天是星期日，她准又回家了。他相信不会有人埋怨他，女儿心眼儿清亮，知道爸爸来支援农业一定会高兴的。我祝福他有这样一个好闺女。他爽朗地笑起来，又告诉我：他们厂从去年开始和楚塘公社挂了钩，每次下乡总少不了他；帮助农民安钢磨，修水泵，修锅驼机……。他很有风趣地说：“这是俺厂的亲戚，日久不来，还怪想的哩。”说着他笑起来，笑得连小胡子都一抖一抖的。接着打量了我一会儿就笑嘻嘻地问：“张同志拿着胡琴来支援农业，是剧团的吧？”
    “我们是文艺服务队。有剧团的，有艺术馆的，还有曲艺队的。在田里和社员一起作活，休息时就地宣传，又编又写又演又唱。”
    “这主意好啊，社员们准欢迎”，老人眉开眼笑地说，“活干累了，听听歌，看看戏，疲劳一甩，劲头又鼓起来了，你们可真会跃进啊！”
    太阳终于跃出来，它红通通的像一个大火球。彩霞在天空泛滥，河水承受着阳光，斑斑闪灼，金波鳞鳞，多么美好的早晨呀！
    老人抬起头，用硬壳夹子搭成遮篷向对岸望去，回头对我说：“摆渡哥大概把咱给忘了。”
    “可能那边客人也多。”我回答。一时间，我想起：他不是支援河西岸楚塘公社吗？干嘛到东岸去，这夹子里面又放的什么东西？我于是便问他。
    “取经去！”他说，“昨天我们楚塘公社姚队长到河东参观，回来说不晓得哪家工厂的女工人，支援河东的门楼公社，想了个巧办法，使抽水机的功效一下提高了三倍。昨晚上我就执意要去瞧瞧，姚队长说摸黑瞎火过河不放心，非等今天不可。这不，还带着夹子好去画图哩！”
    这时，岸上跑来一个人，高声喊着：“任师傅！任师傅！”
    “姚队长来了。”他说。
    来人跑到他跟前，头上满是汗水，喘了一口大气才埋怨道：“啊呀，你走干嘛不叫我一声！”姚队长转脸对我说：“你看，一听说门楼的抽水机效率高，非叫咱楚塘一夜赶上不可。这不，一大早，饭没吞一口就去取经……”
    不知什么时候，摆渡船正稳稳地朝这边摇来。岸上的人，不约而同地向河里望去，船渐渐地近了。
    任师傅和姚队长并肩站着，注视着摆渡船，像是船一靠岸，他们就要纵身跃上去似的。
    船上的一切都看得很清楚，船头上坐着一个年青的姑娘，身后是一个四十几岁的中年人，白色的浪花一簇一簇地在船头开放。
    任师傅擦擦眼睛，好像发现什么新奇的东西似的，突然伸开两臂笑着喊起来：“淑英——”。
    船上那个姑娘也愉快地应着：“爸爸，你怎么在这呀？”
    “爸爸来支援农业，你没回家吗？”
    “我们也来支援农业，到门楼两天啦。”船上的人跳下来，淑英姑娘燕子似的走到爸爸跟前，亲热地依偎着，一对乌黑的眸子在闪动：“爸爸，你过河去吗？……”
    “他们是爷俩？”中年人问。
      “是呀！”姚队长这才恍然大悟地跳起来，奔到任师傅跟前说：“咱不用去取经啦，门楼派人给咱送上门来了，发明人就是你女儿呀！我的好大伯，多有意思！”
    “淑英，是你？”
    “爸爸！”
    “爸爸找你去取经啊！”老人放开洪亮的嗓门说：“把图纸都带来啦？走吧，不过河了，回楚塘去！”
    看着眼前的情景，待渡的忘了上船，摆渡工忘了摇浆。这是生活中的一件小事，可它激动了渡口上所有的人。
    渡船开动了，岸上的人，船上的人高呼“再会！”太阳的万道金光照耀着美丽的山河，天更蓝，水更清，山更高，人更美了……。
