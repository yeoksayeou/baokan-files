Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 29th: People's communes in Shandong are rushing to plant late-season wheat while, in the spirit of "early action and using early action to promote good results," they are strengthening the management of early-season wheat seedlings, working on both planting and management to lay a solid foundation for a good wheat harvest next year.

Due to the strengthening of leadership by Party committees at all levels in the sowing of winter wheat, early-season wheat throughout the province was planted ahead of schedule, and most of the wheat seedlings are growing well, with some beginning to tiller. However, because Shandong Province encountered a severe drought before planting this year, most of the early-season wheat was planted against the drought, the land is dry and hard, irrigation is uneven, and there are many clods in the wheat fields. In particular, due to abnormal weather, there are many plant diseases and insect pests, so some wheat fields have experienced missing seedlings, broken ridges, and pest damage. In order to change this situation as soon as possible and ensure that wheat generally achieves full and vigorous seedling growth, various localities have carried out large-scale wheat field inspections and strengthened winter wheat seedling management in advance, based on the principle of adapting to local conditions and supplementing what is lacking. Yantai, Heze, Changwei, Liaocheng and other regions have recently organized a certain force to conduct a general inspection of the emergence and growth of early-season wheat. In the inspection, Chenwu County, Heze Prefecture, organized more than 5,000 auxiliary laborers to engage in pest control and seedling inspection and replenishment activities. In just two days, they controlled pests on more than 27,000 mu and replenished seedlings on more than 9,000 mu as they inspected.

Some areas immediately shifted to wheat seedling management after the winter wheat sowing was basically completed. Laiyang County, Yantai Prefecture, after completing the wheat sowing plan on the 11th, is now actively expanding the planting of early-maturing crops such as barley and peas. At the same time, it is concentrating a large number of laborers to strengthen wheat field seedling management, and is carrying out a mass movement of early management, fast management, and good management throughout the county. Many production teams in Yandian Commune, Guan County, have recently mobilized commune members to formulate wheat field management plans and are starting to repair canals to irrigate wheat with "pandon water" and winter-sealing water. Potou Commune in Wudi County has recently arranged a certain amount of labor, livestock, and vehicles to form specialized fertilizer digging, transporting, and applying teams, and has begun to apply "pre-irrigation fertilizer" to wheat to ensure vigorous seedling growth.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: People's communes in Shanxi Province are implementing sowing and management simultaneously in the sowing of winter wheat, conducting timely seedling inspection and replenishment, repairing ridges and topdressing for wheat fields that have emerged one after another, striving for full seedlings on every mu and striving for increased wheat production next year.

Shanxi Province launched a wheat planting campaign centered on seizing time, speeding up, ensuring area, and ensuring quality around the time of White Dew. According to inspections in various places, this year's wheat sowing is not only fast, but also exceeds previous years in terms of sowing quality. The vast majority of wheat seedlings that have emerged are growing well. In order to make the wheat seedlings grow well, commune members in various places, in addition to actively doing a good job in preparing the land and preserving moisture for the wheat fields that are being sown to ensure good planting, they have also inspected the wheat fields that have been sown piece by piece and ridge by ridge. If they encounter soil that is too dry or has clods, they immediately harrow, break the soil, and preserve moisture to promote early emergence of wheat seedlings. Missing seedlings and broken ridges in wheat fields were also replenished in a timely manner. Under the slogan of "sowing, inspecting, and replenishing simultaneously," the people's communes in the Southeast Shanxi Prefecture have all replenished the 700,000 mu of wheat fields with missing seedlings. More than 2,000 commune members in Qingxu County completed the tasks of replenishing seedlings, replenishing fertilizer, and eliminating overwintering pests in more than 9,000 mu of wheat fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: The broad masses of commune members in people's communes in Shaanxi Province are grasping wheat sowing with one hand and seedling management with the other, realizing full and vigorous seedlings on every mu.

The sowing quality of regular-season wheat in Shaanxi Province this year is better than in any previous year. In order to strive to achieve increased wheat production next year, commune members in various places immediately carried out seedling inspection and replenishment, pest and disease prevention and control, and early topdressing as soon as the wheat emerged. Fengxiang County organized manpower to sow late-season wheat on the one hand and inspect and replenish seedlings on the other hand when regular-season wheat sowing was about to end. Now all 40,000 mu of wheat fields with missing seedlings and broken ridges in the county have been replanted. Under the slogan of "careful inspection and clever replenishment to ensure full seedlings," Xinmin Commune in Bin County organized 30 inspection teams and 36 specialized seedling replenishment teams to carry out a concentrated seedling inspection and replenishment campaign.

Various places began to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests as soon as the wheat emerged. As early as early September, the Provincial Department of Agriculture sent 15 cadres and technicians to eight communes in Weinan, Dali, Sanyuan and other counties, which have historically been severely affected by rust disease, to conduct investigations and organize commune members to prevent and control wheat rust. Fangli Commune in Sanyuan County has achieved rust disease forecasting groups in every team and rust disease forecasters in every small team. It has also established 86 specialized rust disease prevention and control groups with 272 participants, who are regularly responsible for inspecting and eliminating the harm of rust disease to wheat seedlings. In wheat field management, various places also carried out early topdressing, harrowing, and compaction on wheat fields to promote seedling squatting and prevent lodging.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi: In the vigorous winter wheat sowing campaign, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region seized the season, rushed for time, grasped multi-sowing with one hand and seedling inspection and replenishment with the other, strengthened field management, and ensured that every mu was fully planted with strong seedlings.

Various localities have concentrated about 80% of the labor force and the vast majority of draft animals and various sowing machines into autumn sowing. People's communes generally arrange the fields in order, according to the season, temperature differences, soil moisture, and the degree of tidiness, etc., to rush to sow in order, which greatly accelerated the sowing progress, sowing more, sowing better, and sowing more timely than in any previous year.

Various communes also organized professional seedling inspection, measurement and acceptance, and replanting personnel, combined with mass inspection and evaluation, to conduct field inspections and accept fields piece by piece. If they found plots with missing seedlings, broken ridges, lost edges, corners, or missed sowing, they immediately replanted or resowed. After inspection, Turpan, Shanshan and other counties found that there were missing seedlings and broken ridges in wheat fields due to missed sowing and water shortage, and immediately organized manpower and machinery to rush to irrigate and shallowly harrow, and then replanted to ensure that every mu was fully planted with strong seedlings in every plot.

At present, the early-sown winter wheat north and south of the Tianshan Mountains is a lush green, and in some areas the wheat seedlings have sealed the ridges. While rushing to sow and accept, the people's communes also generally arranged labor to carry out an early winter wheat field management campaign centered on irrigation and topdressing, so that no third-class seedlings would overwinter. While carrying out general irrigation, Aksu Prefecture also topdressed wheat fields, and sprayed pesticides on some wheat fields to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests.

    山东山西陕西新疆力争明年夏粮增产
    及早动手加强麦田管理
    干部群众积极查苗、补苗、浇水、追肥、防治病虫害
    本报济南29日电　山东各地人民公社在突击抢种晚茬麦的同时，本着“早字当头，以早促好”的精神，加强早茬麦幼苗管理，作到边种边管，为争取明年小麦丰收打下可靠的基础。
    由于各级党委加强冬小麦播种的领导，全省早茬小麦提前播种完毕，小麦幼芽大部生长良好，有的已开始倒股盘墩。但由于今年山东省在播种前夕遇到严重的干旱，早茬小麦大部是抗旱抢种，土地干硬，浇水不匀，麦田坷垃多；特别是由于气候失常，病虫害较多，因此部分麦田出现了缺苗断垅、病虫危害现象。为了及早改变这种状况，使小麦普遍达到苗全苗旺，各地本着因地制宜，缺啥补啥的原则，开展了麦田大检查和提前加强了冬小麦苗期管理工作。烟台、菏泽、昌潍、聊城等地区，最近组织一定力量对早茬小麦出土和生长情况普遍进行了大检查。菏泽专区成武县在检查中组织了五千多名辅助劳力，投入扑杀害虫和查苗补苗活动，仅两天时间就防治虫害二万七千多亩，随查随补九千多亩。
    一些地区在冬小麦播种基本结束后，立即转向小麦苗期管理。烟台地区莱阳县在11日完成小麦播种计划后，现在一面积极扩种大麦、豌豆等早熟作物；一面集中大批劳力加强麦田苗期管理，并在全县范围内开展了一个早管、快管、管好的群众性运动。冠县燕店公社许多生产队，最近发动社员制订了麦田管理计划，并着手整修渠道，以便给小麦浇盘墩水和封冻水。无棣泊头公社最近安排一定的劳力、畜力和车辆，组成挖肥、运肥、施肥专业队，开始对小麦补施“水前肥”，以保证幼苗茁壮旺盛。
    据新华社太原电　山西省各地人民公社在冬小麦播种中，实行边种、边管，对陆续出苗的麦田及时进行查苗补苗、整修畦田和追肥等工作，力争亩亩苗全满垅，争取明年小麦增产。
    山西省在白露前后，就开展了抢时间、赶速度、保面积、保质量为中心的种麦运动。据各地检查，今年的小麦播种不仅速度快，播种质量也超过了往年。已经出土的麦苗绝大部分生长良好。各地社员为了使块块麦苗生长得好，除积极对正在下种的麦田做好整地保墒工作，保证种好外，对已经下种的麦田都逐块逐垅地进行了检查，检查中遇到土壤过干或有土块，便立即进行耙地、碎土保墒，促使麦苗提早出土。对缺苗断垅的麦田也及时进行了补种。晋东南专区各人民公社在“边种、边查、边补”的口号下，对缺苗的七十万亩麦田已全部进行了补种。清徐县二千多名社员在九千多亩麦田里，分别完成了补种、补肥和消灭越冬虫害的任务。
    据新华社西安电　陕西省各地人民公社的广大社员，一手抓小麦播种，一手抓幼苗管理，实现了亩亩苗全苗旺。
    陕西省今年正茬小麦的播种质量，比以往任何一年都好。为了力争实现明年小麦增产，各地社员从小麦一出土，就立即进行查苗补苗、防治病虫害和提早追肥等工作。凤翔县在正茬小麦播种将要结束时，就组织人力，一面播种回茬麦，一面查苗补苗。现在全县缺苗断垅的四万亩麦田全部进行了补种。邠县新民公社在“细查巧补保全苗”的口号下，全社组织了三十个检查组和三十六个补苗专业组，开展了突击性的查苗补苗工作。
    各地从小麦一出土，就开始了防治病虫害的工作。省农业厅早在9月上旬就派了十五个干部和技术人员，分赴历年来锈病严重的渭南、大荔、三原等县的八个公社进行调查并组织社员防治小麦锈病。三原县方里公社已做到队队都有锈病测报组、小队都有锈病测报员。并成立了有二百七十二人参加的八十六个防治锈病的专业组，经常负责检查和消灭锈病对麦苗的危害。在麦田管理中，各地还及早对麦田进行追肥耙耱镇压，促使蹲苗，防止倒伏。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆维吾尔自治区在轰轰烈烈的冬麦播种运动中，抓季节，抢时间，一手抓多播，一手抓查苗补苗，加强田间管理，保证亩亩种足，苗全苗壮。
    各地都集中了80％左右的劳动力和绝大部分耕畜、各种播种机具投入秋播。各人民公社普遍做到田块排队，按照季节早迟、气温差别以及土地墒情、整理程度等，循序抢种，大大加快了播种进度，比已往任何一年都播得多，播得好，播得适时。
    各公社还组织专业的查苗、丈量验收、补种人员，和群众性的检查评比相结合，进行田头检查，逐块验收，发现有缺苗、断垅、丢边、遗角或漏播的地片，立即补播或重播。吐鲁番、鄯善等县经过检查以后，发现由于漏播、缺水而发生的缺苗、断垅麦田，都立即组织人力、机具突击浇水、浅耙，然后补种，使亩亩种足，块块苗全苗壮。
  目前，天山南北早播冬麦已一片嫩绿，有些地区麦苗已封垅。各人民公社在抢播、验收的同时，还普遍安排劳力，开展以浇水、追肥为中心的冬麦早期田间管理运动，不让三类苗越冬。阿克苏专区在普遍浇水的同时，还给麦田追肥，并在部分麦田喷洒农药，防治病虫害。
