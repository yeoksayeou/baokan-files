The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have called on us to mobilize the entire Party and all the people to vigorously develop agriculture, vigorously develop grain production, and launch an increase production and conservation movement centered on grain and steel. This is the most urgent, most important, and most glorious task for achieving a sustained leap forward in the national economy. In order to accomplish this task, the Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, according to the instructions of the Provincial Committee, calls on all cadres and people in the region to further inherit and carry forward the revolutionary spirit and fine traditions of the Yan'an era, further boost revolutionary vigor, work hard, rely on our own efforts, and build all undertakings through diligence and thrift, to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of grain, steel, and other production plans, and to achieve a sustained leap forward in the cause of socialist construction.

The work style of the Yan'an era is also the fine work style of our Party. The people of the Yan'an area still have vivid memories of this fine work style. During the difficult War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to defeat Japanese imperialism and overcome the encirclement and blockade of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the soldiers and civilians of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, under the personal leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, relied on revolutionary will and their own hands to vigorously engage in production and construction, overcame unimaginable material difficulties, achieved self-sufficiency in food and clothing, smashed the encirclement and blockade of the Kuomintang reactionaries, defeated Japanese imperialism, and then immediately won the victory of the national revolution.

Not long after the founding of the People's Republic of China—on October 26, 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong sent a telegram to the people of Yan'an, urging them to "always maintain the spirit of hard struggle that the staff in Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region had in the past ten years." Two years later, he called on the people of the old revolutionary base areas to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." The teachings of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong will always inspire the people of Yan'an to move forward. We relied on our own hands to rebuild our homes on the ruins destroyed by the Hu Zongnan bandit gang, develop production, and quickly heal the wounds of war. On the basis of completing the socialist transformation, and after fully entering the socialist economic construction, the Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly issued a combat call to the people of the region to "work hard, develop production, struggle arduously, and transform nature," guiding the people to hold high the red banner of continuous revolution, forge ahead courageously, and achieve one victory after another. Especially since 1958, under the brilliant light of the General Line, we have achieved continuous great leaps forward. In the industrial field, we have established and expanded iron smelting, coal, machinery, electricity, chemical industry, petroleum, timber, cement, building materials, matches, ceramics, paper making, and various processing industries. In the long-term struggle to transform nature and develop agricultural production, the natural landscape has been gradually changed, and the situation of low yields has begun to be reversed, achieving a surplus in grain production. At the same time, cultural, educational, health, and other undertakings have greatly developed, and the material and cultural lives of the broad masses have been further improved and enhanced. This is a victory for the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and it is also a victory for the people of the entire region in inheriting and carrying forward the work style of the Yan'an era.

The work style of the Yan'an era is our country's revolutionary "heirloom," a proletarian revolutionary work style based on a high degree of revolutionary determination. This work style demonstrates the proletarian spirit of continuous revolution, the revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism of proletarian revolutionary fighters. We inherited and carried forward this fine work style. During the period of national economic recovery, we waged a resolute struggle against the erroneous thinking of "the revolution has succeeded" and unwillingness to move forward among some cadres, and conducted education on the concept of continuous revolution among the people of the region, greatly stimulating the revolutionary spirit of the masses and promoting the rapid recovery of the national economy to pre-war levels. In socialist transformation and socialist construction, we waged irreconcilable struggles against various right-leaning conservative ideas, educating the people to understand that the proletariat originally fought the world empty-handed, and it is inconceivable to engage in revolution without difficulties, and it is equally inconceivable to engage in construction without difficulties, encouraging the people of the region to strive for progress, never bow their heads in the face of any difficulties, establish lofty ambitions, and change the backward situation. Under the encouragement of this spirit, people have generated endless power for socialist construction. Taking mountain and river management as an example, in order to transform the natural landscape and turn low yields into high yields, the people of the region, with the willpower of "cold weather can't cool enthusiasm, frozen ground can't freeze determination, heavy snow can't cover confidence, and cold wind can't blow down perseverance," braved wind and snow, and fired at the earth, and have achieved remarkable results. The struggle with nature in the past few years has made people fully believe that under the leadership of the Party, as long as they strive for progress, boost their vigor, and vigorously launch mass movements, it will not take long for the poor and backward old mountainous areas to be completely built into prosperous and happy new mountainous areas.

In the Yan'an era, Comrade Mao Zedong called on the soldiers and civilians of the liberated areas to "do it themselves" and "have ample food and clothing." He said: "We advocate self-reliance. We hope to have foreign aid, but we cannot rely on it. We rely on our own efforts and on the creativity of all soldiers and civilians."① These words spoken by Comrade Mao Zedong sixteen years ago still have great practical significance today. From their own experiences over the years, the people of Yan'an have realized that hard work and self-reliance are the fastest and most reliable ways to become rich and strong. However, a few people like to rely on the state and on higher authorities, acting as "hand-stretchers." We criticized this unpromising and unambitious "young master" style, and promoted the spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, which led to a great leap forward in the construction cause. Taking local industry as an example, this is how it has developed. Initially, a few comrades believed that there were no machines, no technology, no raw materials, and no personnel, and that this could not be done, and that was impossible. After the education of revolutionary traditions, we called on the people of the region to "make our own machines if we don't have them, learn our own technology if we don't have it, find our own raw materials if we don't have them, raise our own funds if we don't have them, and build our own houses if we don't have them," pushing the mass movement of vigorously developing industry to a new climax. In just two years, with the help of the state, we relied on our own hands, used local materials, used indigenous methods, combined indigenous and foreign methods, and overcame numerous difficulties, so that state-owned industries have developed rapidly, and commune-run enterprises have grown from nothing, from small to large, each people's commune has an average of more than ten factories and mines, operating in more than a hundred projects, and producing many products that did not exist in the past. For more than ten years, the vast number of cadres have always adhered to the fine tradition of diligence, thrift, and hard work, and many government offices, schools, factories, and mines have basically achieved self-sufficiency in meat and vegetables, and some units have also achieved partial self-sufficiency in grain. At present, an even broader movement for production and self-sufficiency is being carried out more deeply and extensively, and saving grain, saving cloth, saving money, saving materials, and saving labor have become a new fashion among the people of the region.

The work style of the Yan'an era is the work style of the most thorough mass line. Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and organizing the masses to achieve the revolutionary tasks of various periods are the core of the revolutionary spirit and fine work style of the Yan'an era. The practice of revolutionary struggle has repeatedly proved that inheriting and carrying forward the Party's fine work style will make us forever invincible. The vast majority of cadres in the Yan'an area have adhered to the Party's fine work style. The practice over the years, especially the mass movement to vigorously develop grain, vigorously develop industry, and manage mountains and rivers, has made us further realize that in socialist construction, the most important thing in implementing the mass line work style is that leading cadres at all levels must go deep into the front line of production, share weal and woe with the people, participate in production, lead production, often go deep into the actual struggle, see more, ask more, think more, do more, and be good at using the Marxist-Leninist leadership methods of "dissecting a sparrow" and "grasping the two ends and leading the middle" to promote work. Sitting in the office for a long time, relying on meetings and telephone calls to guide work, not going deep into reality to understand the situation, and not contacting the fresh things in the surging mass movement will make your mind go moldy and become a mediocre person with unclear direction and standing still. Going deep into reality, going deep into the grassroots, eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses has become a system that the vast number of cadres in the Yan'an area consciously abide by. For many years, we have always insisted that 80% of the cadres go deep into practical work, and each cadre has agricultural tools and works wherever they go. This year, we have also widely promoted the "three-seven system" among county and commune cadres, and the "one-nine system" leadership method among production team cadres. According to statistics from January to July this year alone, 65 leading cadres, including the secretary of the prefectural party committee, the commissioner, the secretary of the county party committee, and the county magistrate, worked at the grassroots level for an average of 95 days each, of which 53 were able to participate in labor, averaging more than 40 days each, thus solving many specific problems in practical work. In order to quickly change the backward situation of poor teams, the method of cadres staying in the teams for a long time to serve as deputy positions to strengthen leadership has been widely implemented in the region. In July this year, after comprehensively summarizing this experience, the prefectural party committee once again transferred 65 prefectural department and bureau chiefs, county party committee secretaries, county magistrates, and county section chiefs and ministerial-level cadres to further strengthen leadership in backward teams, and designated it as a system to be implemented for a long time. During the mountain and river management movement in the Yan'an area from last winter to this spring, more than 5,000 cadres at the four levels of the prefecture, county, commune, and management area stayed in the mountain and river management construction sites, always living and producing with the masses, observing the situation, finding solutions, cultivating typical examples, setting up pace-setters, and promoting the overall situation, so that the movement surged one wave after another, higher and higher, achieving the requirements of high speed and high standards of management. The Party's mass line is a guarantee for the victory of work, a magic key to overcome difficulties, solve problems, and promote work, and an important method for transforming, training, cultivating, and improving cadres. The problem that must be solved at present is how to seriously and steadily solve one practical problem after another after going deep into the front line of production, more powerfully promote work, and further promote and carry forward the mass line work style.

The Party's call to promote the revolutionary spirit and fine traditions of the Yan'an era among all cadres is of great significance, and it will surely further promote the high-speed advancement of socialist construction. Party organizations at all levels and the vast number of cadres in the Yan'an area warmly support and are implementing this call with practical actions. However, our work is still very insufficient. Among some comrades, there are still bureaucratic work styles that are divorced from the masses and phenomena of extravagance and waste, love of comfort, and unwillingness to do hard work, and even the erroneous argument that "the Yan'an work style is outdated." To inherit and carry forward the work style of the Yan'an era, we must constantly struggle against these erroneous views and work styles. Comrade Mao Zedong, in his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, pointed out: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, and the work is greater and more arduous... We must make our comrades continue to maintain a humble, prudent, non-arrogant, and non-impatient work style, and we must make our comrades continue to maintain a hard-working work style."② Therefore, we must strive to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, break down the old and establish the new on a large scale, promote the proletariat and eliminate capitalism, and further carry out the propaganda and education of carrying forward the revolutionary tradition among the people. At present, we have drawn 90% of the cadres from the prefectural, county, and commune levels to form two fronts, going deep into the front lines of industrial production and agricultural production, vowing to win a double harvest of grain and steel. We believe that under the brilliant light of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and under the encouragement of the revolutionary spirit of the Yan'an era, the cause of socialist construction in the Yan'an area will surely achieve greater victories!

    延安时代的革命精神永远鼓舞着我们前进
    中共延安地委第一书记　白志明
    党中央和毛泽东同志号召我们，全党动员，全民动手，大办农业，大办粮食，开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动。这是实现国民经济持续跃进的最迫切、最重要也是最光荣的任务。中共延安地委为了实现这一任务，根据省委指示，号召全区干部和人民进一步继承与发扬延安时代的革命精神和优良作风，更大地鼓足革命干劲，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，勤俭办一切事业，确保粮、钢和其它各项生产计划的完成和超额完成，实现社会主义建设事业的持续跃进。
    延安时代的作风也就是我们党的优良作风。延安地区人民至今对这种优良作风记忆犹新，在艰苦的抗日战争时期，为了战胜日本帝国主义，战胜国民党反动派的包围与封锁，陕甘宁边区的军民，在党中央和毛主席亲自领导下，依靠革命的意志和自己的双手，大搞生产建设，克服了难以想像的物质困难，达到了丰衣足食，粉碎了国民党反动派的包围与封锁，战胜了日本帝国主义，并且紧接着取得了全国革命的胜利。
    中华人民共和国成立不久——1949年10月26日，毛泽东同志电勉延安人民，要“永远保持过去十余年间在延安和陕甘宁边区的工作人员中所具有的艰苦奋斗的作风。”两年以后，他又号召老区人民：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”。党和毛泽东同志的教导，永远鼓舞着延安人民前进。我们依靠自己的双手，在胡宗南匪帮破坏的废墟上，重建家园，发展生产，迅速医治了战争创伤。在完成社会主义改造的基础上，全面进入了社会主义的经济建设以后，中共延安地委及时向全区人民发出“埋头苦干，发展生产，艰苦奋斗，改造自然”的战斗号召，引导人民高举不断革命的思想红旗，奋勇前进，取得了一个接一个的胜利。特别是从1958年以来，在总路线的光辉照耀下，实现了连续大跃进。在工业方面，建立和扩大了炼铁、煤炭、机械、电力、化工、石油、木材、水泥、建筑材料、火柴、陶瓷、造纸以及各种加工工业等。在改造自然和发展农业生产的长期斗争中，使自然面貌得到逐步改变，开始扭转了低产局面，达到粮食生产自给有余。与此同时，文化、教育、卫生等事业都有了很大的发展，广大群众的物质文化生活得到进一步改善和提高。这是总路线、大跃进和人民公社的胜利，也是全区人民继承和发扬延安时代作风的胜利。
    延安时代的作风是我国革命的“传家宝”，是建立在高度的革命坚定性基础上的无产阶级革命作风。这种作风表现了无产阶级的不断革命的精神，表现了无产阶级革命战士的革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义精神，我们继承和发扬这种优良作风，在国民经济恢复时期，曾经对部分干部中产生的“革命成功了”再不愿意前进的错误思想作了坚决的斗争，向全区人民进行不断革命思想的教育，大大激发了人民群众的革命精神，推动国民经济迅速恢复到战前水平。在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中，又向各种右倾保守思想进行不调和的斗争，教育人民懂得无产阶级本来就是赤手空拳打天下的，搞革命没有困难是不可设想的，搞建设没有困难同样是不可设想的，鼓舞全区人民发愤图强，在任何困难面前决不低头，树立雄心壮志，改变落后面貌，人们在这种精神鼓舞下，产生了进行社会主义建设的无穷的力量。以治山治水为例，为了改造自然面貌，变低产为高产，全区人民以“天冷冷不了热心，地冻冻不了决心，大雪盖不住信心，寒风吹不倒恒心”的毅力，冒风踏雪，向地球开火，已取得了显著的成绩。几年来与大自然的斗争，使人们充分地相信，在党的领导下，只要发愤图强，鼓足干劲，大搞群众运动，不要很长的时间，贫穷落后的旧山区完全可以建设成为繁荣幸福的新山区。
    延安时代，毛泽东同志曾号召解放区的军民“自己动手”，“丰衣足食”。他说：“我们是主张自力更生的。我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”①毛泽东同志在十六年前说的这些话，今天仍然有着巨大的现实意义。延安人民从多年来的切身经历中认识到，艰苦奋斗、自力更生是最迅速、最可靠的富强之道。但是，也有少数人却喜欢靠国家，靠上级，作“伸手派”。我们批判了这种没出息、没志气的“大少爷”作风，发扬了艰苦奋斗、自力更生的精神，使建设事业出现了大跃进的局面。以地方工业来说，正是这样发展起来的。最初，少数同志认为没机器，没技术，没原料，没人材，这也办不到，那也不可能。经过革命传统的教育，号召全区人民“没有机器自己造，没有技术自己学，没有原料自己找，没有资金自己凑，没有房子自己盖”，把全民性的大办工业运动推向新的高潮。仅仅两年，在国家扶助下，我们依靠自己的双手，就地取材，土法上马，土洋并举，克服了重重困难，使国营工业有了飞速发展，社办企业从无到有，从少到多，从小到大，每个人民公社平均已有十个以上厂矿，经营项目达百余种，生产了许多过去所没有的产品。十余年来，广大干部一直坚持了克勤克俭、艰苦朴素的优良传统，许多机关、学校、厂矿已基本做到肉食、蔬菜自给，一些单位还实现了粮食部分自给。目前一个更广泛的生产自给运动，正在更深入更广泛地开展着，节约用粮，节约用布，节约用钱，节约用料，节约用劳动力，已成为全区人民的一种新风尚。
    延安时代的作风是最彻底的群众路线的作风。相信群众，依靠群众，发动群众，组织群众实现各个时期的革命任务，是延安时代革命精神和优良作风的核心。革命斗争的实践反复证明，继承和发扬党的这种优良作风，就使我们永远立于不败之地。延安地区的绝大多数干部坚持了党的这种优良作风。多年来的实践，特别是全民大办粮食、大办工业和治山治水运动，使我们进一步认识到，在社会主义建设中，贯彻群众路线的工作作风，最重要的就是，各级领导干部必须深入生产第一线，与人民群众同甘苦，参加生产，领导生产，经常深入到实际斗争中，多看、多问、多想、多做，并善于运用“解剖麻雀”、“抓两头、带中间”的马克思列宁主义的领导方法推动工作。长期坐在办公室里，靠会议、靠电话指导工作，不深入实际了解情况，不接触汹涌澎湃的群众运动中的新鲜事物，脑子就会发霉，就会变成方向不明、固步自封的庸人。深入实际，深入基层，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，已成为延安地区广大干部自觉遵守的一种制度。多年来我们一直坚持80％的干部深入实际工作，每个干部都备有农具，走到哪里劳动到哪里。今年，我们又在县、社干部中普遍推行了“三七制”，在生产队干部中推行了“一九制”的领导方法，仅据今年1至7月份统计，地委书记、专员、县委书记、县长等六十五名领导干部，平均每人在基层工作九十五天，其中能参加劳动的五十三人，平均每人劳动到四十多天，这样就解决了实际工作中的很多具体问题。为了迅速改变穷队落后面貌，在全区普遍实行了干部长期住队担任副职加强领导的办法。今年7月，在全面总结这一经验之后，地委再次抽调了专区部、局长，县委书记、县长和县的科长、部长级干部六十五名，到落后队进一步加强领导，并定为一种制度长期贯彻执行。去冬今春延安地区治山治水运动中，专、县、社、管区四级五千多名干部，常驻治山治水工地，始终和群众生活、生产在一起，看情况，找办法，培养典型，树立标兵，推动全面，使运动一浪接一浪，一浪高一浪，实现了高速度、高标准治理的要求。党的群众路线，是工作取得胜利的保证，是克服困难、解决问题、推动工作妙用无穷的钥匙，是改造、锻炼、培养、提高干部的重要方法。当前必须解决的问题，就是在深入生产第一线后，如何认真地扎扎实实地解决一个一个的实际问题，更有力地推动工作，使群众路线的工作作风更深入地发扬光大。
    党号召在全体干部中发扬延安时代的革命精神和优良传统，具有十分重大的意义，它必将进一步促进社会主义建设高速度前进。延安地区各级党组织和广大干部热烈地拥护并正在以实际行动贯彻执行这一号召。但是，我们的工作还很不足，在一些同志中，还存在着脱离群众的官僚主义作风和铺张浪费、贪图安逸、不愿做艰苦工作的现象，甚至还有“延安作风过时了”的错误论调。要继承和发扬延安时代的作风，就必须和这些错误的观点与作风进行不断的斗争。毛泽东同志在党的七届二中全会的报告中指出：“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。……务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”②因此，我们要努力学习毛泽东同志的著作，以毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，大破大立，兴无灭资，在人民群众中，进一步开展发扬革命传统的宣传教育。目前我们已从专、县、社三级抽调90％的干部组成两条战线，深入工业生产和农业生产的第一线，誓夺粮、钢双丰收。我们相信，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，在延安时代革命精神的鼓舞下，延安地区的社会主义建设事业必将取得更大的胜利！
