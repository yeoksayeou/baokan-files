Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 18th - Romanian workers in all walks of life, in the socialist labor competition, practice thrift and have achieved remarkable results.

Saving raw materials, electricity, and fuel is one of the main contents of the labor competition that has been widely carried out this year. Factories, workshops, and even individuals have formulated specific savings plans. To ensure the realization of the plan, they have put forward many rationalization proposals and technical innovation measures.

Steelworkers have saved a lot of steel and coke. By mid-September, the rolling workers of the Resita Metallurgical Combine had saved 1,200 tons of steel by adopting the negative tolerance rolling method; the blast furnace workers had saved 5 million lei (Romanian currency) by using natural gas instead of coke.

The employees of the machinery manufacturing industry are fighting to save every millimeter of metal. Many factories have improved designs on the premise of ensuring product quality, and reduced the weight of the body when designing tractors, automobiles, etc. For example, the "Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej" Carriage Factory has saved more than 1,000 tons of metal this year. The "Red Flag" Automobile Factory in Stalin City has saved 1,500 tons of metal since the beginning of this year due to careful calculation. The metal saved by the Ernst Thälmann Tractor Factory can manufacture 240 tractors.

Refinery workers also actively participated in the savings campaign. Workers at the Ploiesti No. 2 Refinery put forward the slogan "Maximize the Use of Every Ton of Crude Oil." The employees of the Câmpina No. 4 Refinery have completed the guarantee of saving 1.6 million lei for the whole year four months ahead of schedule. Workers at the Vascov Oil Drilling Company in the Pitești region have reduced costs by nearly 2 million lei in the first eight months of this year by shortening non-production time. The young workers of the "May 1st" Petroleum Equipment Manufacturing Factory in Ploiesti adhere to their slogan of "Don't waste a leu, use every leu effectively." From the beginning of this year to the end of August, they have saved 10 million lei.

Basic construction and the construction industry attach great importance to saving investment and building materials. In some chemical enterprises, some machinery and equipment that can work in the open air will no longer build factory buildings, thus saving a lot of investment. Construction workers in Hunedoara have proposed an initiative to save enough materials for one house for every twenty-four houses built. This initiative has been widely echoed by construction workers.

The fuel-saving campaign carried out in departments such as transportation, state-owned farms, and machine tractor stations has also achieved outstanding results. Since the beginning of this year, the coal saved by the locomotive drivers of the Timisoara Railway Administration can supply all the locomotives of this administration for more than one month. The fuel saved by the tractor drivers of the Pitești State Machine and Tractor Station can supply more than 80 tractors for the entire summer, and at the same time, the cultivation cost has been reduced by 30% compared with last year. The workers of the Sighetu Marmației Logging Yard put forward the initiative of "cut down fewer trees, produce more timber." They decided to cut down 10% fewer trees than the original plan and comprehensively complete this year's production tasks. This initiative has been responded to by most logging yards across the country. (Attached picture)

### 罗马尼亚劳动者厉行节约

    罗马尼亚劳动者厉行节约
    节约原材料、电力和燃料是劳动竞赛的一个主要内容；工厂、车间和个人都订出了具体节约计划；机器制造业的职工为节约每一毫米的金属而斗争；炼油厂工人提出了“最大限度地利用每一吨原油”的口号；建筑工人重视节约投资和建筑材料；机车司机和拖拉机手开展节约燃料的运动；伐木工人提出了“少伐树，多出材”的倡议
    新华社布加勒斯特18日电　罗马尼亚各行各业的劳动人民，在社会主义劳动竞赛中，厉行节约，取得了显著成绩。
    在今年广泛开展的劳动竞赛运动中，节约原材料、电力和燃料是竞赛的主要目标之一。各工厂、各车间，甚至个人都订出了具体的节约计划。为了保证计划的实现，他们提出了许多合理化建议和技术革新措施。
    钢铁工人节约了大量的钢材和焦炭。到9月中旬为止，累希察冶炼联合企业的轧钢工人，由于采用负公差轧钢法，节约了一千二百吨钢材；高炉工人由于利用天然气代替焦炭，已节约了五百万列伊（罗币）。
    机器制造业的职工为节约每一毫米的金属而斗争。许多工厂都在保证产品质量的前提下，改进了设计，在设计拖拉机、汽车等时，减轻了机体的重量。例如“格奥尔基·季米特洛夫”车厢制造厂今年已节约了一千多吨金属。斯大林城的“红旗”汽车制造厂由于精打细算，今年以来已节约了一千五百吨金属。恩斯特·台尔曼拖拉机厂节约的金属可制造二百四十台拖拉机。
    炼油工人也积极参加了节约运动。普罗什蒂第二炼油厂工人提出了“最大限度地利用每一吨原油”的口号。契姆皮纳第四炼油厂职工已提前四个月完成了全年节约一百六十万列伊的保证。彼特兹迪州瓦斯科夫石油钻井公司的工人，由于缩短了非生产时间，在今年的前八个月中，就降低成本将近二百万列伊。普罗什蒂的“五一”石油设备制造厂的青年工人坚持他们提出的“不浪费一个列伊，有效地使用每个列伊”的口号，他们从今年年初到8月底已经节约了一千万列伊。
    基本建设和建筑业对节约投资和建筑材料很重视。在一些化学企业中，有些机器设备能在露天工作的就不再修建厂房，这样就省下了大笔投资。洪尼多阿拉的建筑工人提出了每建筑二十四套住宅节约出一套住宅材料的倡议。这个倡议都得到建筑工人的广泛响应。
    在交通运输和国营农场、机器拖拉机站等部门中开展的节约燃料的运动也取得了优异的成绩。今年以来，底密索拉州铁路管理局机车司机所节约的煤可供这个管理局所属全部机车行驶一个多月之用。彼特兹迪州机器拖拉机站的拖拉机手所节约的燃料，可供八十多台拖拉机整个夏季使用，同时，耕作成本比去年降低了30％。西盖特伐木场的工人提出了“少伐树，多出材”的倡议，他们决定比原定计划少伐10％的树木而全面完成今年的生产任务，这一倡议得到全国大多数伐木场的响应。（附图片）
