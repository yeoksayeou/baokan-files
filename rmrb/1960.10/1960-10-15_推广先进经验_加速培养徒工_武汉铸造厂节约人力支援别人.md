    Promoting Advanced Experiences, Accelerating Apprentice Training
    Wuhan Foundry Conserves Manpower to Support Others
    (Our dispatch) The Wuhan Foundry in Hubei has launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations", rapidly training new workers and rationally utilizing labor, saving a large amount of labor. From January of last year to the end of August this year, it successively transferred 414 technicians and cadres to support key units such as Wuhan Iron and Steel and the agricultural front. The current number of employees has decreased by one-third compared to the beginning of last year, while the output from January to September has increased by 45.7% compared to the same period last year.
    Wuhan Foundry is a large professional foundry production unit in Wuhan City. In addition to completing its own production tasks, it also undertakes the glorious task of training and transporting talents in the foundry profession. In response to this situation, the factory Party committee proposed a large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution to change the manual operation of foundry workers, liberate labor, and achieve the call of "increasing production and reducing manpower."
    Under the ideological guidance of "increasing production without increasing manpower, increasing production and reducing manpower" and "seeking high production and labor from technical innovation and technical revolution," the sixth workshop of the factory started with a major process revolution and promoted the national advanced casting technology—mud mold and metal mold casting, greatly saving molding workers and auxiliary workers. In the past, making a sand mold pump body required four people; now, one person can do it. The number of molding workers in the entire workshop has been reduced from 223 to 141.
    Actively cultivating and improving the technical level of new workers to ensure product quality is also an important measure for the factory to achieve increased production without increasing manpower. In the past, some new workers had high scrap rates for castings due to lack of technical proficiency. After the leaders went deep into the front line, they helped the new workers learn technology, enabling them to quickly master the skills of independent operation, ensuring the quality of the mold, and directly saving labor.
    Another approach of the factory to save labor is to combine the mass movement with strengthened scientific management, establish democratic management, and enable the five members of the group (propagandist, planner, tool manager, safety and health officer, and welfare officer) to fully play their role in ensuring production and promoting production, forming a fighting organization, thereby reducing the number of management personnel in the factory and workshops.

### 推广先进经验　加速培养徒工  武汉铸造厂节约人力支援别人

    推广先进经验　加速培养徒工
    武汉铸造厂节约人力支援别人
    本报讯　湖北武汉铸造厂开展以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，快速培养新工人、合理使用劳动力，节省了大批劳动力。从去年1月到今年8月底，先后抽调了四百一十四名技术工人和干部支援了武钢等重点单位和农业战线，现有职工人数比去年年初减少了三分之一，而1月至9月产量却比去年同期增长了45.7％。
    武汉铸造厂是武汉市较大的专业铸造生产单位，除完成本厂生产任务外，还担负着培养和输送铸造专业人材的光荣任务。针对这种情况，厂党委提出了大闹技术革新和技术革命，改变翻砂工人手工操作，解放劳动力，做到“增产又减人的号召”。
    在“增产不增人，增产又减人”和“向技术革新和技术革命要高产要劳力”的思想指导下，这个厂的第六车间，从大搞工艺革命入手，推广全国先进铸造技术——泥型、金属型铸造，大大地节省了造型工和辅助工。过去做砂型水泵体，四个人才能做一个，现在一个人就能做一个。全车间造型工人由二百二十三人减少到一百四十一人。
    积极培养提高新工人的技术水平，保证产品质量，也是这个厂实现增产不增人的一项重要措施。过去有些新工人由于技术不熟练，有时铸件废品率高。领导深入第一线后，帮助新工人学习技术，使他们很快学会独立操作的技能，保证了造型质量，也直接节约了劳动力。
    这个厂节约劳动力的另一个做法是大搞群众运动和加强科学管理相结合，建立民主管理，使小组五大员（宣传员、计划员、工具管理员、安全卫生员、生活福利员）充分发挥保证生产、促进生产的作用，形成战斗的组织，从而减少了厂部和车间管理人员。
