Xinhua News Agency, 12th - Lieutenant Colonel Szymanski, Deputy Military Attaché of the Polish People's Republic Embassy in China, held a reception tonight to celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the Polish People's Army.

General Wang Shusheng, Vice Minister of National Defense of our country, was invited to attend the reception. On behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, he extended warm and fraternal congratulations to the heroic Polish People's Army.

General Wang Shusheng said that the Polish People's Army, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, has now become a powerful armed force with modern military technology and equipment, and has made important contributions to safeguarding the socialist construction of the motherland and defending European and world peace. The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army are delighted and encouraged by the brilliant achievements of the Polish comrades-in-arms.

General Wang Shusheng said that the people of our two countries and the two fraternal armies support each other and cooperate closely, whether in building our own socialist motherlands or in the glorious cause of defending peace. The Polish people have consistently supported the Chinese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression, for the preservation of national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and for the liberation of Taiwan, Chinese territory. Similarly, the people of our country firmly support the just stand of the Polish People's Republic on the Polish-German border issue, and believe that the Oder-Neisse border is the final border. He said that the militant friendship and cooperative relations between our two peoples and armies, built on the ideology of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism, are eternal and unbreakable.

General Wang Shusheng emphasized that the people of our country are vigilantly watching the U.S. imperialism's activities of expanding armaments and preparing for war under the guise of "peace," and resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's support for old colonialists in suppressing the revolutionary movements of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries and plotting all aggressive conspiracies. He said that with the unity and resolute struggle of the socialist camp countries and the people of the world, any sinister conspiracy of U.S. imperialism will surely meet with shameful failure.

Lieutenant Colonel Szymanski spoke first at the reception. He said that the Polish People's Army has formed its own characteristics in the national liberation struggle against the German Hitlerite occupiers and in the struggle to consolidate the people's regime. Our army has solid ties with the people, and our army actively participates in the domestic socialist construction, sharing weal and woe with the people.

Lieutenant Colonel Szymanski said that our army, together with the allied armies, defends the peaceful construction of socialism. He said that particularly dangerous to peace are the aggressive plans of the West German militarists. The West German Ministry of Defense General Staff's recently published memorandum demanding comprehensive atomic weapons equipment, as well as the rallies and demonstrations by West German revanchists demanding the revision of the western border, fully expose the aggressive face of the West German militarists. All this is happening with the continuous support of the United States and other countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to the Federal Republic of Germany.

Lieutenant Colonel Szymanski said that we cherish the friendship with the great Chinese People's Liberation Army. The glorious tradition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is precious and close to our army. The Polish army wholeheartedly supports the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan from the U.S. occupation.

Jerzy Knothe, Ambassador of the Polish People's Republic to China, attended the reception.

Also invited to attend the reception were senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, including General Fu Zhong, General Li Jukui, General Chen Bojun, Lieutenant General Li Shouxuan, Vice Admiral Dun Xingyun, Lieutenant General Luo Yuanfa of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Tang Yanjie, Lieutenant General Yuan Ziqin, Major General Li Yimin, and officers from the army, navy, and air force units stationed in Beijing.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo was invited to attend the reception.

Heads of diplomatic missions, military attachés, and diplomatic officials from various countries to China were invited to attend the reception.

    庆祝波兰建军十七周年
    波兰驻华武官举行招待会
    新华社12日讯　波兰人民共和国驻中国大使馆副武官席曼斯基中校今晚举行招待会，庆祝波兰人民军建军十七周年。
    我国国防部副部长王树声大将应邀出席了招待会。他代表中国人民解放军全体指战员，向英勇的波兰人民军致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    王树声大将说，波兰人民军，在波兰统一工人党领导下，现在已经成为一支拥有现代军事技术装备的、强大的武装力量，并且在保卫祖国的社会主义建设，捍卫欧洲及世界和平的伟大事业中，作出了重要贡献。中国人民和人民解放军，对波兰战友们所取得的辉煌成就，感到欢欣鼓舞。
    王树声大将说，我们两国人民和两支兄弟军队，不论在建设自己社会主义的祖国或者是在保卫和平的光荣事业中，都是互相支援，密切合作的。波兰人民一贯支持中国人民为反对美帝国主义侵略、维护国家主权和领土完整以及解放中国领土台湾而进行的斗争。同样，我国人民也坚决支持波兰人民共和国在波、德边界问题上的严正立场，认为奥得—尼斯河边界为最后的边界。他说，我们两国人民和军队建立在马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义原则上的战斗友谊和合作关系，是永恒的，牢不可破的。
    王树声大将强调说，我国人民正警惕地注视着美帝国主义在“和平”外衣的掩盖下，所进行的扩军备战活动，并坚决反对美帝国主义支持旧殖民主义者镇压殖民地、半殖民地人民的革命运动和策划一切侵略的阴谋。他说，在社会主义阵营各国及全世界人民的团结一致和坚决的斗争下，美帝国主义的任何罪恶阴谋，必定遭到可耻的失败。
    席曼斯基中校在招待会上首先讲话。他说，波兰人民军在向德国希特勒占领者进行的民族解放斗争中，以及在巩固人民政权的斗争中，形成了自己的特点。我们的军队同人民有着巩固的联系，我们的军队主动地参加国内的社会主义建设，同人民共享甘苦。
    席曼斯基中校说，我们的军队同友军一起保卫社会主义的和平建设。他说，对和平来说特别危险的是西德军国主义分子的侵略计划。西德国防部总参谋部最近发表的要求全面原子武器装备的备忘录，以及西德复仇主义分子要求修改西部边界的集会和示威，充分地暴露出西德军国主义分子的侵略面目。这一切都是在美国和北大西洋公约组织的其他国家，不断地给予德意志联邦共和国支持的情况下发生的。
    席曼斯基中校说，我们珍视同伟大的中国人民军队的友谊。中国人民解放军的光荣传统，对我们的军队来说是宝贵的和亲切的。波兰军队全心全意地支持中国人民解放军把台湾从美国的占领下解放出来。
    波兰人民共和国驻中国大使耶日·克诺泰出席了招待会。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有傅钟上将、李聚奎上将、陈伯钧上将、李寿轩中将、顿星云海军中将、罗元发空军中将、唐延杰中将、袁子钦中将、李逸民少将等中国人民解放军高级将领和驻京陆、海、空军部队军官们。
    外交部副部长罗贵波应邀出席了招待会。
    各国驻华使节、大使馆武官和外交官员应邀出席了招待会。
