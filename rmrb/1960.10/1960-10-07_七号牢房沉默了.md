    Cell Number Seven Fell Silent
    [Algeria] Aihmed Akkache

    The cell had no windows. Just a small hole, scarcely bigger than a copper coin, and covered on the outside by an iron plate. I couldn't see my fellow prisoners, but I could hear their voices. From these voices, I slowly got to know them. They were serious, rough, cheerful, lively voices; the happy, jesting voices of Algerian street youths, precocious in the old alleys of the big city; voices singing in the low, melodious tunes of the Djenzin mountains. The voices of these young men indicated that the vast majority of these condemned prisoners were not yet over twenty or thirty years old.

    I had gotten used to listening to Mairchak and Mostafa, Arawa and Hamid, Muhammed, Qassem and Java talking in this way every night. Java's voice was especially clear, because his cell was right below mine. Sometimes in the evenings we could even exchange a few words if we both got close to that small air hole that let a sliver of light into his cell.

    He and Qassem both lived in the same district as me. They were both workers around twenty years old. Like the people of all colonial countries, they had grown up in disaster, come of age in unemployment, and finally been shaped by poverty. One night, they killed the district's police chief and were sentenced to the guillotine. Thus, the three of us met again in prison.

    When I was finally allowed out for a walk alone, the first thing I heard was the sound of chains in the yard next door. This sound came from the courtyard of the death row cells. At the same time, two faces appeared on the top of the wall. Qassem and Java leaned on the eaves of the washroom and smiled at me: "Look how thin you've gotten! ... Are you alright?"

    "Thank you—very good, very good!"

    "Any news?"

    "Be brave, it's all good news!"

    Java's round face glowed, and his cunning little eyes sparkled. He knew very well that I had been in solitary confinement for eight days and wouldn't have any new information now. But that didn't matter. Trust and optimism had become the norm here. If you felt annoyed by prison life and answered directly, "So-so, just getting by," then these condemned men would encourage you and tell you: "Cheer up, victory must belong to us! It will live on, whether we can see it or not!" "It" was the motherland—Algeria. Later he asked, "Do you need anything? Any tobacco left?"

    In an instant, a carton of blue-paper-wrapped prison-issue cigarettes flew over the top of the wall. I picked it up and threw it back.

    "Are you crazy? I have plenty myself, and everything else too!"

    To prove this, I tossed a large piece of chocolate over the wall. This chocolate had been stuffed into my pocket not long ago by the "isolation prisoners" as I walked past their window.

    The guards heard the voices and came over. We had to separate. But this was only a postponement, because as usual, tonight, with the huge, routine commotion after roll call, a leaflet full of camaraderie and hope would be passed from one cell to another.

    But tonight I was a little uneasy. Just now I climbed up to the air hole and quietly called out, "Java!"

    "Here!"

    "How are things?"

    "Pretty good, pretty good! Be brave!"

    I didn't want to tell him what I had just heard in the visiting room. I learned there that extreme colonialists were launching increasingly frantic provocations in Algiers. A few days ago, racists even marched all the way to the prison gates demanding blood.

    Their wish was fulfilled. Yesterday morning, four of our comrades sentenced to death were murdered. At that time, the entire prison roared with anger. All the fellow prisoners, including the criminals, more than two thousand people, held a twenty-four-hour hunger strike. This day in prison was spent in sorrow and solemnity.

    What reason did I have to be troubled by this unfortunate premonition tonight? They wouldn't dare to be ferocious for two days in a row. The guillotine had probably been returned to its gloomy place or was being transported to Constantine and Oran. There, the same bloody slaughter was waiting for it to complete. But, tonight… tonight… I couldn't fall asleep for a long time.

    The prison had been asleep for two or three hours. The surroundings were so quiet that even the deep breathing and dry coughs of the neighboring fellow prisoners could be heard. The lights in the corridors and exercise yards shone bleakly. People could hardly feel the mechanical footsteps of the watchmen on their rounds. A few meters away from me downstairs, fifty-nine fellow prisoners sentenced to death were sleeping. Although they knew that sacrifice was imminent, they remained very calm. But when they lay down on their straw mats at night, each of them said to himself, "Maybe tonight it's my turn…"

    I fell into a hazy sleep. But I didn't sleep soundly, and I was often awakened by nightmares. It must have been two in the morning. I vaguely heard a shout: "They're here again, brothers, they're here again!"

    I jumped up from the straw mat. All the lights were turned off. The cell was in complete darkness. Someone was quietly saying behind the door, "Cell Seven, Cell Seven…" A jumble of footsteps and the clanging of keys sounded below. Then came the loud cry of a man being dragged away: "Farewell, brothers, be brave, long live Algeria!"

    Suddenly, the entire prison cell was awakened. Grief and anger erupted: "Murderers! Murderers!"

    The cries grew louder and louder, magnificent and unstoppable. This cry roared like the roar of the avenger and stirred up thunderous echoes on the roof of the prison cell. Everyone shook the iron bars of the prison cell, roared out of the windows, pounded on the prison doors with their fists, and used shouts and songs to bid a final farewell to the dead.

    The lights came on again, bringing temporary calm. Rumors spread around: "They took five people. Among them were Mairchak, Muhammed…"

    In the darkness and chaos, everyone was unable to see clearly who the other people were. These five people were now waiting in front of death row for the final moment to arrive.

    From far, far away, beyond the prison walls, a clear, heroic, challenging cry came: "Long live Algeria! Long live independence!"

    A young fellow prisoner shouted before his execution, "Down with France!" But a comrade next to him immediately corrected him calmly and rationally: "Down with French colonialism! Long live Algeria!"

    Ivonton, Galardi, "Little Morocco" and all the other comrades also shouted the same slogans before their execution.

    At this time, the blade of the guillotine was shining brightly as it fell toward its steel slot. Perhaps a twenty-year-old young man had lost his head. But a burst of extremely strong and victorious cries rang out in the prison cell: "Long live Algeria! Long live Algeria!"

    Suddenly, everyone fell silent. From the women's prison came the final echoes of the united protest of the suffering sisters, as if from a distant, mournful prayer: "Long live Algeria! Long live Algeria!"

    The intermittent protests continued for another hour, and angry cries resounded in the most hidden corners. The entire prison cell became a huge chest, where countless hearts beat in unison.

    Now all of this has passed. The five comrades who were lost will live in the burning hearts of the entire nation. The fellow prisoners returned to their straw mats one after another.

    A voice broke the silence: "Brothers, everyone will avenge you…"

    That evening, the fellow prisoners held a get-together in the prison cell. At this meeting, five young and loud voices were missing. People could no longer hear the voices of Mairchak, Muhammed… I thought of the other patriots who had just lost their heads, of the Algerian young soldiers who had not yet been executed, and also of the last leaflet sent by a comrade in Cell Seven. How brave he was! Who was he? Java would tell me. I couldn't wait to grip the prison bars and shout, "Java!"

    There was no response. He probably didn't hear.

    "Java! – Java!"

    Still no answer.

    I felt a choke in my throat. I shouted downwards for the last time with all my strength. How I longed to hear again the passionate voice of this young man who loved work, loved life, and pursued joy! I felt that, like me, dozens of pairs of ears around me were waiting for his reply… but nothing was waiting. It was the ruthless silence of the dead. At this time, we all understood: Java, like Mairchak and Muhammed, could no longer answer us. Cell Seven was his.

    I collapsed weakly onto the bed. My eyes stared at the pale night. Java's cell was empty. He was my friend, comrade, and brother. In my dream… I saw again his innocent, grinning smile on the wall of the washroom. In my dream… I thought of our forerunners, of the children of France, Greece, and China, and of all those who shed their blood for the progressive cause of mankind. "If only I could start life again…"

    Outside, it was dawn. Swallows twittered. They were still a little timid and surprised by the suffocating silence after the storm. I smelled waves of refreshing fragrance—the fragrance of the winter jasmine blossoming on the martyrs' graves at dawn.

    七号牢房沉默了
    〔阿尔及利亚〕　阿迈德·阿卡歇
    牢房里没有窗子。只有一个小洞，比一枚铜钱大不了多少，外面还罩着一层铁板。我看不到在押的难友，但是我能听到他们的声音。根据这些声音，我慢慢地认识了他们。这是些严肃、粗犷、开朗、活泼的声音；是些在大城市古老的胡同里早熟了的阿尔及利亚街头青少年们的快乐、谐谑的声音；是些用津津拉山区低沉而悠扬的旋律歌唱着的声音。这些年轻人们的声音表明：这些已经定了死罪的难友绝大部分都还没有超过二三十岁。
    我已经习惯于每天晚上用这种方式来听迈尔查克和摩斯塔发，阿拉瓦和哈米德，穆罕默德，茄塞姆和加伐等人的谈话。加伐的声音听得特别清楚，因为他的牢房就在我的下面。有时在晚上我们甚至可以交谈几句，如果彼此都凑近那个微微漏进一线光明到他牢房中去的气孔的话。
    他同茄塞姆都和我住在一个区里。他们都是二十岁左右的工人。和所有殖民地国家的人民一样，他们都是在灾难中长大，在失业中成人，在贫困中最后定了型的。一天晚上，他们杀死了区里的警察长，被判决上断头台。因此我们三个人在狱中又碰在一起了。
    当我终于被允许一个人出来走走的时候，头一天我便听到隔壁院子里的链条声。这声音来自死囚牢的庭院。同时，墙头上出现了两张面孔。茄塞姆和加伐倚着盥洗室的屋檐向我微笑着：“看你变得多瘦啊！……身体还好吗？”
    “谢谢——很好，很好！”
    “有什么消息没有？”
    “勇敢些吧，尽是好消息！”
    加伐的圆脸上容光焕发，一双狡黠的小眼睛迸发着火花。他知道得很清楚，我单独囚禁了八天，现在是不会有什么新消息的。但这没有关系。在这儿信任和乐观已成了规律。如果你对牢狱生活感到烦躁，而直截了当地答道：“还好，马马虎虎。”那么，他们这些已经定了死罪的人就会向你打气，鼓励你说：“振作起来吧，胜利一定属于我们！她将生存下去，不管我们能否看到！”“她”是祖国——阿尔及利亚。后来他问：“你需要什么吗？烟草还有没有？”
    刹时间，一盒蓝纸包的监牢专用香烟从墙头上面飞了过来。我将它捡起，扔了回去。
    “你们疯了吗？我自己有的是，而且样样都有！”
    为了证实这句话，我将一大块巧克力隔墙抛了过去。这块巧克力是不久前当我散步经过“隔离犯”的窗口时，由他们塞到我的口袋里来的。
    看守们听到说话声，跟了过来。我们不得不分开了。但这不过是推迟一会儿罢了，因为和平常一样，今晚随着点名后那种巨大的、照例有的骚动，一张充满了手足之情和希望的传单又会从一个牢房传到另一个牢房里去的。
    可是今晚我有点不安。刚才我爬到气孔，悄悄地叫了一声“加伐！”
      “在这儿！”
    “怎么样？”
    “相当好，相当好！勇敢些吧！”
    我不想告诉他刚刚在探监间里听到的事。我在那儿获悉，极端殖民主义分子正在阿尔及尔发动一次越来越疯狂的挑衅。几天前种族主义者还将游行示威队伍一直开到了监狱的门前索取鲜血。
    他们的愿望得逞了。昨天早上，我们的四位判了死刑的同志遭到了杀害。当时整个监狱都怒吼了起来。全体难友，包括刑事犯在内，两千余人举行了二十四小时的绝食斗争，监狱里的这一天是在悲哀和肃穆中度过的。
    今天晚上我有什么理由要为这种不幸的预感所困扰呢？他们不至于连着两天逞凶吧。断头机说不定给放回了阴森森的地方，或是正在运往康士坦丁勒和奥兰的途中。在那儿，同样的血腥屠杀正有待它去完成。但是，今天晚上……今天晚上……我却久久不能成眠。
    监狱已沉睡了两三个钟头了。周围是如此地寂静，连邻近难友们深沉的呼吸声和干咳声都能听得到。走廊和放风间里的电灯凄凉地亮着。人们几乎感觉不到那时时轮换的守夜者的机械的脚步声。在离我几米远的楼下，睡着五十九名判处死刑的难友。他们虽然知道牺牲就在眼前，但是始终非常镇定。不过当晚上躺到草垫上去的时候，他们每个人都暗自说：“也许今天夜里轮到我……”
    我迷迷糊糊地睡着了。但睡得一点也不沉，经常为梦魇所惊醒。现在该是清晨两点了。我隐隐约约地好像听到一阵叫喊声：“他们又来了，弟兄们，他们又来了！”
    我一骨碌从草垫上跳了起来。灯光全部熄灭了。牢房里一片黑暗。门后有人在悄悄地说：“七号牢房，七号牢房……”下面响起了杂沓的脚步声和开锁的叮当声。接着传来一个被架走的人的响亮的呼喊声：“别了，弟兄们，勇敢些吧，阿尔及利亚万岁！”
    骤然间，整个牢房都苏醒了。沉痛和愤怒爆发了出来：“凶手！凶手！”
    呼声雄壮地、不可阻挡地越来越响。这一呼声像复仇者的怒吼一样在轰鸣，并在牢房的屋顶激起雷霆般的回响。大家摇撼牢房的铁栅，从窗口向外怒吼，用拳头捶打牢门，用叫喊和歌声来和死难者作最后的诀别。
    灯光又亮了，带来了暂时的平静。周围传说着：“他们带走了五个人。其中有迈尔查克，穆罕默德……”
    在黑暗和纷乱中大家没有能看清楚另外的几个人是谁。他们这五个人现在正在死囚牢前面等待着最后时刻的到来。
    从遥远遥远的地方，越过牢狱的围墙，清晰地传来了一阵豪迈的、挑战一般的叫喊：“阿尔及利亚万岁！独立万岁！”
    一个年轻的难友在就义前喊道：“打倒法国！”但是他旁边的一个同志立即镇定而理智地纠正道：“打倒法国殖民主义者！阿尔及利亚万岁！”
    伊凡通，盖拉迪，“小摩洛哥”以及所有其他的同志在临刑前也都喊着这同样的口号。
    这时断头机上的铡刀正亮闪闪地向它的钢槽落去。也许是一个二十岁的小伙子失去了他的头颅。可是牢房里响起了一片无比强烈的、胜利的呼声：“阿尔及利亚万岁！阿尔及利亚万岁！”
    突然间，大家沉默不响了。从女牢那儿传来了受难姊妹们的一致抗议的最后的回声，好像是来自远处的沉痛的祈愿：“阿尔及利亚万岁！阿尔及利亚万岁！”
    此起彼伏的抗议声又持续了一个小时，愤怒的呼声响彻了最隐蔽的角落。整个牢房成了一个巨大无比的胸膛，无数颗心在那儿一致地跳动。
    现在这一切过去了。失去的那五个同志将活在全民族炽热的心中。难友们重新一个接着一个地躺到草垫上去。
    有一个声音划破了沉寂：“弟兄们，大家会替你们报仇的……”
    这天傍晚，难友们在牢房里举行了联谊会。在这会上少掉了五个年轻响亮的嗓子。人们再也听不到迈尔查克，穆罕默德……的声音了。我想到其他几位刚刚失去头颅的爱国者，想到那些尚未就义的阿尔及利亚青年战士，同时我也想到七号牢房里的一个同志传来的最后一张传单。他是多么的勇敢呀！他是谁呢？加伐会告诉我的。我迫不及待地握紧牢栅叫道：“加伐！”
    没有应声。他大概没有听到。
    “加伐！——加伐！”
    还是没有回答。
    我喉咙里感到一阵哽噎。我竭尽全力地向楼下叫了最后一声。我是多么渴望再听一听他这个热爱工作、热爱生活和追求欢乐的小伙子的热情的嗓音啊！我感到和我一样，周围竖着几十对耳朵在等待着他的回答……但是什么也没有等着。这是死者无情的沉默。这时我们大家都懂得了：加伐和迈尔查克以及穆罕默德一样，再也不能回答我们了。七号牢房是他的。
    我无力地倒到床上。两眼凝视着苍白的夜色。加伐的牢房空了。他是我的朋友、同志和兄弟。在梦中……我再一次从盥洗室的墙头上看到他天真的、咧嘴的微笑。在梦中……我想到了我们的先行者，想到了法国、希腊以及中国的儿女们，也想到了所有为人类的进步事业而流血的人们。“要是可以再开始生活的话……”
    外面天亮了。燕子呢喃地叫了起来。它们对暴风雨后的窒人的静寂还有点胆怯和惊异。我嗅到了一阵阵沁人心脾的清香——那黎明时盛开在烈士墓上的迎春花的芳香。
