    A Beijinger
    Bai Nationality, Na Jialun
    I, a border person born and raised on the Yunnan Plateau, deeply admire Beijingers.
    For several years, I've carried a diary with me, inside of which is a photo clipped from a pictorial from a border哨所 (sentry post): a photo of a Beijing girl presenting flowers to Chairman Mao. In this same diary, there's also a finely printed oil painting of a female traffic police officer directing vehicles in front of Tiananmen. Both the girl and the female police officer have faces full of pride and happiness. The more deeply I miss the place where Chairman Mao lived, the more I admire Beijingers.
    Unexpectedly, through an unanticipated opportunity, I came to Beijing, a place I had longed for day and night. As soon as I arrived in Beijing, I realized that whether it's a service worker at the Beijing Railway Station, or a police officer on Chang'an Avenue, whether it's a Young Pioneer gazing at Tiananmen, or a mother taking her child to the zoo, they all have a sense of pride and happiness, and they all possess a fire-like enthusiasm.
    Although I left Beijing long ago, I still deeply remember one thing...
    Not long after arriving in Beijing, it was a tense time of meetings. Suddenly, I lost my delegate badge for attending the conference. How anxious I was! But my comrades all comforted me: "Don't worry, it won't be lost, this is Beijing!"
    That's right, this is Beijing, it will definitely be found. I confidently found a female police officer. When she learned that I was from a remote border area and had come to Beijing for the first time, she comforted me: "Comrade, don't worry, it will definitely be found. Please wait a moment, I'll be off duty soon!"
    "Off duty? You should rest after work, how can I trouble you!"
    "It's not trouble, this is our responsibility!" A simple sentence, but full of enthusiasm.
    After she got off work, she found two bicycles and led me to visit every place I had been. She asked about every place in great detail. In the hot weather, sweat soaked her white uniform, but she didn't even think about going back to rest, and kept pedaling the bicycle quickly. I tried hard to catch up with her, and looking at her face with beads of sweat, I really didn't know what to say.
    It wasn't until the sun set and the streetlights were all lit up that she finally listened to me: don't look anymore. She asked me to leave my address and phone number.
    I held her hot hand tightly and looked carefully at her face. I wanted to deeply remember her in my heart. Suddenly, I realized how much she resembled the female police officer in the oil painting, her rosy face revealed the same sense of pride and happiness.
    Although the badge hadn't been found yet, I firmly believed that it would be found.
    Sure enough, as soon as I returned to my dormitory, the phone rang urgently. It was the female police officer's pleasant Beijing accent. She excitedly told me: "Comrade, it's been found! A Young Pioneer found it. In order not to affect your meeting, she decided to deliver it to the entrance of the venue tomorrow morning. Tomorrow at seven thirty, please wait for her under the Monument to the People's Heroes in front of the Great Hall of the People. Goodbye!"
    Before I could say a word of thanks, the phone hung up. But her voice lingered in my heart for a long time. Moved by the enthusiasm of the Beijingers, I didn't sleep all night.
    The next day, I arrived at Tiananmen Square at just after six o'clock. Looking at the magnificent Tiananmen and the extending red walls, looking at the towering Monument to the People's Heroes and the gleaming white Huabiao columns, looking at the night shift workers who had just gotten off work, looking at the groups of children going to school, looking at the police seriously directing the speeding traffic, looking at every pedestrian, I really wanted to shout out loud: "Hello, Beijingers, how grateful I am to you!"
    Right at seven thirty, a girl walked up to my side. She opened her bright black eyes and looked at me for a long time. There was a photo on the badge, so it wasn't difficult for her to recognize me. She said happily: "Uncle, have you been waiting long!"
    She carefully took out the badge from her close-fitting pocket, handed it to me, saluted with a Young Pioneer salute, and then turned and ran away.
    I hurriedly chased after her and shouted: "Little friend, wait, what's your name?"
    She turned around and replied: "I have to go to school, uncle, goodbye!"
    In that moment of her turning around, I saw how much she resembled the Young Pioneer in the photo presenting flowers to Chairman Mao. They both had apple-like round faces, their faces were both brightly colored by the red scarf, and their faces were both full of pride and happiness. Ah, the Young Pioneer in the photo must be her. Such a child should enjoy the noble happiness of presenting flowers to the leader.
    The time had arrived. I excitedly took the badge and strode into the solemn and magnificent Great Hall of the People. Sitting in that spacious and bright conference hall, my heart surged like the rising tide. I was deeply, deeply moved by the Beijingers.

    北京人
    白族　那家伦
    我，一个生在云南高原，长在云南高原的边疆人，深深地羡慕着北京人。
    好几年了，我随身携带的日记本里，夹着一张从边防哨所的画报上剪下来的照片，一张北京的女孩子给毛主席献花的照片。就在这本日记里，还有一张印得十分精致的油画，一张天安门前女警察指挥车辆的油画。那女孩子和那女警察脸上都充满着自豪和幸福的表情。越是深切地怀念毛主席居住的地方，我就越是羡慕北京人。
    想不到，在一个意料不到的机会里，我来到日夜想念的北京。一到北京，我就发觉，不管是北京车站的服务员，或是长安街的警察，不管是凝望天安门的少先队员，或是带着孩子游动物园的母亲，他们都有着自豪和幸福的感情，他们都有着火一般的热情。
    虽然我离开北京很久了，我却仍然深深地记着一件事情……
    到北京不久，正是开会紧张的时候，我忽然把参加大会的证件丢了，这多急人啊！但同志们都安慰我：“别急，丢不了，这是北京！”
    对，这是北京，一定能找到。我自信地找到了一位女警察。当她知道我从遥远的边疆初次来北京时，就安慰我：“同志，您别急，一定能找到。你稍等一会，我马上就下班了！”
    “下班？下班您就该休息了，怎能麻烦您！”
    “不是麻烦，这是我们的责任！”一句普通的话，却充满了热情。
    她下了班，找了两辆自行车，领着我访遍了我到过的每一个地方。她每到一处，都询问得十分详细。大热天，汗水打湿了她洁白的上装，然而她根本没有回去歇息的念头，仍然把车轮蹬得飞快。我用好大劲才撵上她，望着她那汗珠滚动的面孔，我真不知道说什么才好。
    直到日落西山，街头灯火都通亮了，她才总算听了我的话：不要再找了。她让我留下地址和电话号码。
    我紧握着她那滚热的手，仔细端详着她的面孔，我要把她深深地记在心里。突然，我发觉她多么像那油画上的女警察，她那红润润的脸上流露出来的正是那种自豪和幸福的感情。
    虽然还没找到证件，但我坚信一定能找到的。
    果然，我刚回到寝室，电话铃就急促地响起来了，正是女警察那动听的北京话，她兴奋地告诉我：“同志，找到了！一个少先队员捡到的。为了不影响您开会，她决定明天早上送到会场门口给您。明天七点半，您到人大会堂前面的人民英雄纪念碑下等她。再见！”
    没等我说句感谢话，电话挂上了。她那声音却久久地回响在我心中。被北京人的热情所感动，我一夜没合眼。
    第二天，才六点多，我就来到了天安门广场。望着辉煌的天安门和伸展开去的红墙，望着高高矗立的人民英雄纪念碑和洁白闪光的华表，望着刚下班的夜班工人，望着一群群上学去的孩子，望着严肃认真地指挥车辆来往飞驰的警察，望着每一个行人，我真想放开嗓子说一声：“您们好呵，北京人，我多么感谢您们！”
    正七点半，一个女孩子走近我身边。她睁着一双黑亮亮的大眼睛，端详了我好一阵。证件上有照片，她不难认出我。她高兴地说：“叔叔，您等急了吧！”
    她小心地从贴心的衣袋里，取出证件，递到我手里，敬了个队礼，她就转身跑了。
    我急忙追上去，喊道：“小朋友，等等，你叫什么？”
    她回过身来，答道：“我还要去上学，叔叔，再见！”
    在她这回头的一瞬间，我才看到她多么像照片上给毛主席献花的那个红领巾。她们都长着苹果似的小圆脸，她们的脸都被红领巾映得艳红，她们的脸都充满着自豪和幸福的感情。呵，照片上的少先队员一定是她，这样的孩子，应该享受到给领袖献花的崇高幸福。
    时间到了，我十分激动地拿着证件，大步走进庄严宏伟的人民大会堂。坐在那宽大透亮的会场上，我的心像涨潮似的翻腾。我被北京人深深地、深深地感动了。
