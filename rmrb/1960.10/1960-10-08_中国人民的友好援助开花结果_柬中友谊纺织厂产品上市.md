Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 7th. The first batch of cotton yarn and various cotton fabrics produced by the Cambodia-China Friendship Textile Factory, constructed with Chinese assistance, has begun to be sold at the sales department of the State Enterprise Bureau of the Ministry of Planning here.

The person in charge of the sales department told reporters that these cotton yarns and cotton fabrics have been warmly welcomed by customers. On the first day alone, more than 800 pieces of 20-count yarn were sold. There are more than ten kinds of fabrics for sale, including printed cloth, twill, and linen. Other fabrics, including mosquito net cloth, will also be sold soon.

The Cambodia-China Friendship Textile Factory is one of the four factories China helped Cambodia build and held a completion ceremony during Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Cambodia in May of this year. Subsequently, Cambodian workers began trial production with the help of Chinese technicians.

The cotton yarn produced by this factory, spun from Cambodian cotton, is the first batch of products in Cambodian history. Previously, the cotton yarn consumed in Cambodia was always imported from abroad.

    中国人民的友好援助开花结果
    柬中友谊纺织厂产品上市
    新华社金边7日电　中国援助建设的柬中友谊纺织厂所生产的第一批棉纱和各种棉布已在这里的计划部国营企业局售卖部开始出售。
    售卖部的负责人对记者说，这些棉纱和棉布受到顾客的热烈欢迎。仅头一天就售出了二十支纱八百多件。出售的布匹有十多种，其中包括印花布、斜纹布和麻纱。包括蚊帐用布的另外一些布不久也将出售。
    柬中友谊纺织厂是中国援助柬埔寨建设的四座工厂之一，在今年5月间周恩来总理访问柬埔寨期间举行了落成典礼。随后在中国技术人员的帮助下由柬埔寨工人开始进行试验性生产。
    这个工厂生产的用柬埔寨棉花纺成的棉纱，是柬埔寨历史上的第一批产品。以前，柬埔寨消费的棉纱一直是从国外进口的。
