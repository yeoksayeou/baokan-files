In Our Commune

    Chairman Mao said: The countryside is a vast world where much can be accomplished.
    
    Feeling Happy and Honored From the Bottom of My Heart
    
    I used to work in the Communist Youth League in the district. Since the Party Central Committee issued the call to "vigorously develop agriculture and grain production," I applied to go to the countryside to participate in labor.

    In September, I came to the Beibalizhuang Production Team of the Shuangmiao Commune. The secretary of the production team's Youth League branch, Liu Jinting, said to me: "Jinsheng, join our alkali land experiment group!" Then he introduced me to the situation of the experiment group: this production team has more than 600 mu of alkali land, of which more than 50 mu are "dead alkali land" that never grows crops. This year, the twelve members of the production team put forward the slogan "Asking Grain From Alkali Land," using rainwater to wash away the alkali, plowing the land three or four times, and sowing grass seeds. In August, green grass grew on the "dead alkali land." Everyone also read in books that a kind of urea gypsum fertilizer is suitable for application to alkali land, so they sent people to the county fertilizer factory to learn the technology, and now they are producing this fertilizer. Hearing about their glorious deeds in fighting against nature, I was very happy to join this experiment group.

    It was time to plant wheat. Everyone crushed the gypsum and then fermented it with urine. Jinting and the girl Xiulan were not afraid of getting dirty at all, rolling up their trouser legs and working with great enthusiasm. I also worked with them. Later, I participated in plowing, fertilizing, sowing and other farm work. Now the wheat seedlings have emerged from the soil on the dead alkali land. I am really very happy, because there is also a share of my labor in it! I feel happy and honored from the bottom of my heart.

    毛主席说：农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。
    从心里感到高兴和光荣
    我原来在区的共青团工作，自从党中央提出“大办农业、大办粮食”的号召以后，就申请到农村参加劳动了。
    9月间，我来到了双庙公社北八里庄生产队，生产队的团支部书记刘金亭对我说：“金生，参加我们的碱地试验组吧！”接着就向我介绍了试验组的情况：这个生产队有六百多亩碱地，其中有五十多亩是从不长庄稼的“死碱地”。今年，生产队的十二个团员提出了“向碱地要粮”的口号，利用雨水洗碱，翻耕了三、四遍地，撒种了草籽，8月里“死碱地”长出了绿草。大家又从书上看到有一种尿素石膏化肥，适合碱地施用，就派人到县化肥厂学技术，现在正在生产这种化肥。听到他们向大自然作斗争的光荣事迹，我非常高兴地参加了这个试验组。
    要种麦了，大家把石膏轧碎，然后灌尿发酵。金亭和秀兰姑娘一点也不怕脏，挽着裤筒干的真起劲，我也和他们一起干了起来。后来我参加了犁地、施肥、下种等项农活，现在麦苗在死碱地上出土了。我真高兴极了，因为这里面也有我的一份劳动啊！我从心里感到高兴和光荣。
