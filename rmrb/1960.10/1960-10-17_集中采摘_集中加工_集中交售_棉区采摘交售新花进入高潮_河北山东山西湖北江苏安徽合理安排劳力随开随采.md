Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The mass cotton picking and selling campaign launched by people's communes in Hebei Province has entered a new climax. From October 1st to 5th, cotton picking volume increased by 82% compared to late September, and purchasing volume increased by 64%. Currently, the picking and purchasing volumes are increasing daily.

Party committees at all levels in Hebei Province attach great importance to cotton picking and purchasing work. In order to ensure that autumn harvesting, wheat planting, and cotton picking and selling are not delayed, all localities, in the spirit of "overall planning and comprehensive arrangement," have rationally arranged labor and transportation capacity. Zhangbao Production Team of Licun Commune in Qiaoxi District, Shijiazhuang City, adopted a long-term planning and short-term arrangement approach, seizing every opportunity to mobilize 145 women to form 16 cotton picking groups. They harvested in the morning and picked cotton in the afternoon. After the first flush of cotton was picked, they concentrated their efforts on autumn harvesting, fertilizer accumulation, and wheat planting. When the second flush of cotton opened, they launched a concentrated cotton picking campaign, ensuring that autumn harvesting, wheat planting, and cotton picking were not delayed. The team's 604 mu of cotton has been picked twice.

To facilitate the delivery and sale of cotton by production teams and accelerate the speed of new cotton picking and purchasing, commercial departments in various localities, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, have strengthened purchasing forces. At present, more than 1,000 purchasing stations and points have been set up throughout the province. As of now, the amount of seed cotton purchased in the province has reached 80% of the amount picked, basically achieving immediate picking, immediate delivery, and immediate purchasing.

Jinan, October 16th (Our Newspaper) - Shandong's major cotton-producing areas are implementing unified labor arrangements to concentrate on cotton picking and selling to the state. In the main cotton-producing areas of Liaocheng, Zibo, and Changwei, while ensuring good wheat planting, they are concentrating superior forces and using advanced cotton picking methods to focus on picking and selling cotton. By October 10th, the four special districts of Liaocheng, etc., had picked more than 160 million jin of new cotton and sold more than 96 million jin to the state.

On the basis of properly arranging labor, all cotton-producing areas in the province have focused on the following key links: First, adapting to local conditions and flexibly mobilizing labor. Cotton picking professional teams were fully invested in other farm work during the time when cotton could not be picked in the morning and evening; during the gap period when the early wheat planting was basically completed and the late wheat stubble had not been cleared, a large-scale cotton picking assault was launched. Second, rationally stipulating remuneration methods. Linqing, Guanxian, and other places have adopted methods of calculating points according to "flush," grading, awarding bonuses for exceeding quotas, and paying a portion of the money in advance, further encouraging the enthusiasm of commune members. Third, in order to improve the quality of cotton, the "three-two-one" (six people in a group, arranged in front and back in the order of three, two, and one for phased picking) cotton picking method has been widely promoted, cultivating cotton picking experts and carrying out cotton picking competitions.

In order to welcome the large-scale picking and selling of cotton, commercial departments in various localities have recently added stations, equipped personnel, and strengthened cotton purchasing work according to actual needs.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Cotton in Shanxi Province is massively opening, and commune members in the producing areas are joyfully engaged in a concentrated effort to pick new cotton.

This year, all parts of Shanxi have focused on the four key aspects of weeding, fertilizing, watering, and pest control in cotton fields, overcoming the threat of severe drought and ensuring a large number of seedlings, reduced boll shedding, and generally good cotton growth. In order to harvest more, harvest quickly, harvest well, and harvest completely, all localities have generally organized professional teams to pick new cotton. Wanrong County has drawn 30% of its labor force to pick cotton, and the recent daily picking volume has reached about 350,000 jin.

In cotton harvesting, all localities have generally achieved immediate collection, immediate drying, immediate ginning, and immediate sale. All counties in the Jinan Special District have properly arranged labor and animal power, organized specialized teams for picking, drying, processing, and transportation, and promoted the method of centralized picking, centralized processing, and centralized sale.

While picking new cotton, commune members in various localities have also paid great attention to seed selection, preparing for next year's cotton production.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Hubei's cotton-producing areas are taking various effective measures to carefully pick new cotton.

This year, Hubei Province's cotton has grown a large number of summer bolls, and is currently in the peak period of bursting. In order to achieve immediate picking as it bursts and ensure that every boll is gathered, all major cotton-producing areas have implemented the method of centralized leadership, centralized labor, and large-scale mass movement, striving for large-area balanced growth. Tianmen County, a major cotton-producing area, has concentrated more than 100,000 laborers to quickly and carefully harvest new cotton, and now an average of more than 40 jin of seed cotton has been harvested per mu.

In order to give play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members in quickly and carefully harvesting, harvesting well, and storing well, all localities have rationally formulated labor quotas and work point remuneration. Dengnan Commune in Hanyang County formulated different quotas based on the quality of cotton growth, the strength of labor, and the level of technology, and promptly gave rewards to those who exceeded the quota. Due to the good implementation of the policy of more work, more pay, in addition to fixed labor, many auxiliary laborers also participated in the picking work, making the whole commune's cotton picking fast and good.

In the picking of cotton, all localities have also adopted the practice of picking, drying, processing, and putting it into storage at the same time, and selling new cotton to the state in a timely manner. The production teams of Tianmen County have sold more than 19,000 dan of lint cotton.

Nanjing, October 16th (Our Newspaper) - People's communes in cotton-producing areas of Jiangsu Province are seizing the peak period of cotton opening to carry out a mass movement of rushing to pick, rushing to dry, rushing to transport, and rushing to sell new cotton. In the seventeen key cotton-producing counties such as Haimen, Changshu, Dongtai, Haian, and Danyang, 620,000 commune members have been invested in this movement. At present, the average daily collection volume in the province has increased by more than one time compared with the average daily collection volume from the 1st to the 7th of this month, and has increased sharply by 2.9 times compared with the daily collection volume in late September.

Under the requirement of careful harvesting and fine picking, and ensuring that every boll is returned to the barn, all localities have properly arranged labor to ensure that one boll is ripe, one boll is picked, one batch is dried, and one batch is sold. The cotton-producing areas of Xuzhou, Suzhou, and other places stipulate that the labor force ratio is uniformly arranged by the commune, appropriately dispatched by the brigade, and specifically implemented by the team.

In the competition to sell new cotton, all localities have actively sought ways to help solve the needs of communes and teams for seed retention. The main measures taken by various localities to solve this problem are: one is to concentrate rural small ginning machines for production, with the production brigade as the unit, uniformly process, seeds are returned to the team, and lint cotton is sold; the other is that the state's power ginning mill is responsible for processing on behalf, the purchasing station organizes good seeds to be transported to the factory, and labels are stacked and labelled, and distributed to each team for ginning.

Hefei, October 16th (Our Newspaper) - The broad masses of cadres and commune members in the cotton-producing areas of Anhui Province are striving to harvest more frost-resistant cotton. Since entering October, the average daily picking volume has increased by more than one time compared with last month.

In order to improve the efficiency of cotton picking, communes in cotton-producing areas have generally carried out competition movements. After the Huilong Brigade of Chenzhai Commune in Dangshan County launched the red flag competition for picking cotton with both hands, the amount picked by each person per day increased from the original 52 jin to 140 jin, and the quality was very good. All localities have also actively promoted the labor quota system, so that the field head can accept and weigh, and immediately record work points according to the jin, which greatly improves the enthusiasm of commune members in picking cotton.

While accelerating the picking of cotton, Anhui Province has also strengthened the field management of cotton, promoting small bolls to become large bolls, and striving to harvest more frost-resistant cotton. In the case where the white floss in the middle and lower parts of the cotton plants is bursting, and the autumn bolls in the upper part are bearing fruit, all localities have adopted methods of managing according to the field, according to the seedlings, and according to the bolls, and combined the picking of flowers with the removal of old leaves for the first and second types of seedlings, improving the shading of the cotton fields, which is conducive to ventilation and light transmission, and promoting the early maturity of the upper bolls.

    棉区采摘交售新花进入高潮
    河北山东山西湖北江苏安徽合理安排劳力随开随采
    据新华社讯　河北省各地人民公社掀起的群众性的棉花采摘、交售运动，已进入新高潮。10月1日至5日棉花采摘量比9月下旬上升82％，收购量上升64％。目前，采摘、收购量正在逐日增加。
    河北省各级党委对棉花的采摘和收购工作都很重视。为了作到收秋、种麦、摘售棉花三不误，各地都本着“统筹兼顾，全面安排”的精神，合理的安排了劳力和运力。石家庄市桥西区李村公社张堡生产队，采取长计划短安排，见缝扎针的工作方法，发动一百四十五名妇女，组成十六个摘棉小组，上午收秋，下午摘棉，头喷花摘过后，集中力量搞秋收，积肥、种麦，二喷花开了，大搞突击摘棉花，作到秋收、种麦、摘棉三不误，全队六百零四亩棉花，已普摘了两遍。
    为了便利生产队交售，加快新棉采摘收购速度，各地商业部门在党委的统一领导下，加强了采购力量。目前全省已设置采购站、点一千多个。截至目前，全省已收购的籽棉，达到摘量的80％，基本上作到了随摘、随送、随收购。
    本报济南16日电　山东棉花集中产区实行劳力统筹安排，突击采摘棉花，向国家交售。聊城、淄博、昌潍等主要产棉区，在确保种好小麦的同时，集中优势兵力，利用先进的拾棉方法，突击采摘交售棉花。到10月10日，聊城等四个专区已摘拾新棉一亿六千多万斤，交售给国家九千六百多万斤。
    全省各产棉区在妥善安排劳力的基础上，突出抓住以下几个环节：一、因地因时制宜，灵活调动劳力。摘棉专业队在早晚不能摘棉的时间，全部投入其他农活；在早茬麦播种基本结束，晚茬麦没有腾出茬来的空隙期间，大搞棉花采摘突击。二、合理规定报酬办法。临清、冠县等地采取按“喷”、分等记分、超额奖励、预付一部分现款的办法，进一步鼓舞了社员的干劲。三、为了提高棉花质量，各地还普遍推行了“三二一”（六人一组，按三、二、一前后排列分期摘）摘棉法，培养摘棉能手，开展摘棉竞赛。
    为了迎接棉花的大量采摘和交售，各地商业部门最近又根据实际需要增设站、配齐人员，加强棉花收购工作。
    据新华社讯　山西省棉花大批吐絮，产区的社员正以喜悦的心情投入突击采摘新棉。
    今年山西各地狠抓了棉田锄草、追肥、浇水、治虫四大环节，战胜了严重的旱灾威胁，保证了苗多，落铃少，棉花生长普遍良好。各地为了多收快收、收好收足，普遍组织专业队采摘新棉。万荣县抽出30％的劳力摘棉，最近日采量达到三十五万斤左右。
    各地在收棉中普遍作到了随收、随晒、随轧、随交售。晋南专区各县妥善安排了劳力、畜力，组织了采摘、晾晒、加工、运输专业队伍，推行了集中采摘、集中加工、集中交售的办法。
    各地社员在采摘新棉的同时，还十分注意了选种工作，为明年棉花生产作好准备。
    据新华社讯　湖北各产棉区采取各种有效措施，精细采摘新棉。
    今年，湖北省的棉花伏桃长得较多，目前正是炸花盛期。为了做到随炸随采，朵朵归仓。各主要产棉区都实行了集中领导、集中劳力，大搞群众运动的办法，力争大面积平衡增产。主要产棉区天门县，已集中了十多万劳力快收细收新棉，现在平均每亩已采回籽棉四十多斤。
    为了发挥广大社员快收细收，收好藏好的积极性，各地都合理制定了劳动定额和工分报酬。汉阳县邓南公社根据棉花生长好坏、劳力强弱和技术高低，制定不同定额，超过定额者及时给予奖励。由于多劳多得政策执行得好，全社除固定劳力以外，还有很多辅助劳动力也参加采摘工作，使全社棉花采摘得又快又好。
    在收摘棉花中，各地还采取边摘、边晒、边加工、边入库的作法，及时向国家出售新棉。天门县各生产队已出售皮棉一万九千多担。
    本报南京16日电　江苏产棉区各人民公社正抓紧棉花吐絮盛期，开展抢拾、抢晒、抢运、抢售新棉的群众运动。海门、常熟、东台、海安、丹阳等十七个重点产棉县，投入这一运动的社员达六十二万人。目前全省平均日收量较本月1日到7日平均日收量上升一倍多，比9月下旬日收量猛增两点九倍。
    各地在精收细摘、朵絮归仓的要求下，妥善安排劳动力，保证熟一朵、采一朵、晒一批、卖一批。徐州、苏州等地棉区规定劳动力比例由公社统一安排，大队适当调度，小队具体执行。
    在竞售新棉中，各地主动设法帮助解决社、队的留种需要。各地解决这个问题主要采取两种办法：一种是将农村小轧车集中生产，以生产大队为单位，统一加工，种子归队，出售皮棉；另一种是国家动力轧花厂负责代加工，采购站组织良种运厂，分堆挂注标签，逐队分轧。
    本报合肥16日电　安徽省棉产区广大干部和社员，力争多收霜前棉花。进入10月以来，平均日采量比上月提高一倍多。
    为了提高采棉的工效，棉区各公社普遍开展了竞赛运动。砀山县陈砦公社回龙大队开展双手摘棉红旗竞赛运动后，每人每天由原来拾棉五十二斤提高到一百四十斤，而且质量很好。各地还积极推行了劳动定额制，做到场头验收过秤，当场按斤记工分，使社员采棉积极性大大提高。
    安徽全省在加速采摘棉花的同时，还加强了棉花田间管理，促使小桃成大桃，力争多收霜前棉。在棉棵中下部白絮盛吐、上部秋桃累累的情况下，各地都采取了因田、因苗、因桃管理的办法，对一、二类苗结合拾花打去老叶，改进棉田阴蔽，有利通风透光，促使上部桃子提早成熟。（附图片）
