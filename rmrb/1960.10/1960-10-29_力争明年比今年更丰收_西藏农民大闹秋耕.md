Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 28th: After achieving a bumper agricultural harvest, farmers in the Tibet region have launched a high tide of autumn cultivation. At present, in the Lhasa area, where the autumn harvest started earlier, all land has been plowed for the first time. In the Changdu, Xigaze, Shannan, and Gyangze areas, the first plowing has been completed on approximately 50% to 80% of the land.

Before the suppression of the rebellion, Tibetan farmers rarely engaged in autumn cultivation. This year, more than a month ago, farmers were simultaneously harvesting and plowing the land. After the basic completion of the autumn harvest, they invested a large number of laborers in autumn cultivation. Various localities, using mutual aid teams and mutual aid joint teams as units, selected plowmen, trained draught animals, and organized specialized autumn cultivation teams, implementing a method of alternating rest for people and animals with uninterrupted work of tools, plowing day and night. Farmers in some counties in the Shannan area, when plowing distant land, erected tents in the fields to stay overnight, not only ensuring sufficient rest for people and animals but also saving a lot of time.

In this year's autumn cultivation, Tibetan farmers in various localities have widely promoted and used the new-style walking plows distributed to them free of charge by the state in recent years. Before this year's autumn cultivation, some regions continued to distribute a batch of new-style walking plows to farmers. From their own experiences, farmers in various localities generally believe that the walking plow plows deeply, loosens the soil, and can turn weeds under the soil to decompose into fertilizer, which is beneficial to crop growth. Farmers in the Zedang and Changzhu districts of Nedong County used new-style walking plows to plow little land last year. This year, all land is plowed with new-style walking plows, generally to a depth of more than six inches. Farmers in various localities have also improved their original Tibetan plows, adding iron plowshares to wooden plows, and widening and lengthening the moldboard of iron plowshares, thus increasing the speed and quality of plowing.

Developing large-scale collaboration is a new phenomenon in this year's autumn cultivation in the Tibet region. Some districts and townships with abundant labor and sufficient draught animals have taken the initiative to support those with less labor and insufficient draught animals, and those who plowed late have taken the initiative to support those who plowed early. Due to the large-scale collaboration carried out within Jiangbei Township in Lang County, autumn harvesting and threshing were completed in full in twenty-five days, and the first plowing was completed in ten days. During the autumn cultivation, agricultural implement processing plants and iron and woodworking production mutual aid teams went all out to rush to manufacture and repair autumn cultivation agricultural implements for farmers, and agricultural and commercial departments also vigorously supported farmers' autumn cultivation.

At present, autumn cultivation in the Tibet region has entered a high tide, and autumn cultivation red flag competitions are being enthusiastically carried out between districts and districts, townships and townships, and mutual aid teams and mutual aid teams. Cadres in various counties and districts have gone deep into the front lines in autumn cultivation, participating in autumn cultivation, and organizing evaluations and inspections.

### 力争明年比今年更丰收  西藏农民大闹秋耕

    力争明年比今年更丰收
    西藏农民大闹秋耕
    新华社拉萨28日电　西藏地区农民在获得农业丰收后，掀起了秋耕高潮。目前，秋收较早的拉萨地区，全部土地已耕完第一遍，昌都、日喀则、山南和江孜等专区第一遍秋耕也完成了50％到80％左右。
    在平叛以前，西藏农民很少进行秋耕。今年早在一个多月前，农民们就一面秋收，一面耕地，在秋收基本结束后，又把大批劳动力投入秋耕。各地都以互助组、互助联组为单位，选拔犁手，训练耕畜，组织秋耕专业队，实行人畜轮流休息工具不停的办法，日夜抢耕。山南专区部分县的农民，在耕较远的土地时，在地里架设帐篷住宿，不但人畜得到了充分休息，也节省了许多时间。
    在今年的秋耕中，各地藏族农民普遍推广和使用了国家近几年来无偿发放给他们的新式步犁。今年秋耕前，部分地区又继续给农民发放了一批新式步犁。各地农民从亲身体验中，都认为步犁耕得深，土松，能把杂草翻压到土下沤成肥料，有利于庄稼生长。乃东县泽当、昌珠两区农民去年使用新式步犁耕的地少，今年所有土地都采用新式步犁耕，一般深度在六寸以上。各地农民对原有的藏犁也作了改进，将木犁加上了铁制犁头，有铁制犁头的则加宽加长了犁铧，因而耕地的速度和质量都提高了。
    开展大协作，是今年西藏地区秋耕中的新气象。一些劳动力多、耕畜足的区、乡，主动支援劳动力少、耕畜不足的，晚耕的主动支援早耕的。朗县江北乡由于在乡内开展了大协作，二十五天内就全部结束了秋收、打场工作，又用十天时间完成了第一遍秋耕。在秋耕中，各地农具加工厂和铁木业生产互助组全力为农民赶制和修理秋耕农具，农业和商业部门也大力支援农民秋耕。
    目前，西藏地区的秋耕已进入高潮，秋耕红旗竞赛，正在区与区、乡与乡、互助组与互助组之间热烈开展。各县、区干部在秋耕中都深入到第一线，参加秋耕，组织评比和检查。
