    Conquering Difficulties to Lead the Masses in Harnessing Mountains and Rivers, Spreading Cultural Knowledge Among the Pula People
    Ma Zhengchang Sets an Example for Mountainous Area Construction
    Thousands of Mountains and Ravines Found a Water Source
    The Pula People End Their Nomadic Life
    In April, the Honghe River was clear and cloudless, without a trace of rain. In the Yuanjiang Dam area by the Honghe River in Yunnan Province, the air was very dry, and the rice seedlings were on the verge of dying from drought. Commune members of the Nansha Management Area of the Honghe People's Commune in Yuanjiang County fetched water from the Nansha River and wells every day to irrigate the fields, but they could not stop the drought from continuing.

    The Pula people (an ethnic group of Yi) living here often migrated before liberation due to drought, living wherever there was water and moving away when the water dried up. This severe drought was rare in the past, having lasted for more than two hundred days. Old man Yang You San lamented, "We are going to move again." The thoughts of many commune members were also somewhat turbulent.

    Ma Zhengchang, the Communist Party Branch Secretary of the Nansha Management Area and a Pula person, convened a meeting of Party members and Youth League members on the lawn in front of Natang Village. He said, "Right now, the rice seedlings are about to die from drought, and some people want to abandon the rice seedlings and move. What do you all think?" Everyone said they were unwilling to move. But, what could they do to get water?

    Ma Zhengchang encouraged them, saying, "We must rely on the Party and rely on the commune to find water and overcome the drought." The Party and League members' confidence was strengthened, and they all expressed their determination to lead the masses in fighting the drought.

    At that time, the most important issue was to find water to save the drought-stricken rice seedlings. Ma Zhengchang and several cadres from the Management Area went to find water sources separately. He carried a copper pot, took rice, a machete, and a musket, and roamed the thousands of mountains and ravines on the south bank of the Honghe River. When he was hungry, he started a fire in the wilderness, found a little spring water to cook a pot of rice, picked some wild vegetables, and hunted a few wild animals to eat. In this way, he walked from this mountain to that ridge and finally discovered a mountain spring gushing out of a dense forest. He jumped into the water, washing, drinking, and shouting happily. But this mountain spring was at least dozens of miles away from the paddy fields, and by the time a ditch was built, the rice would have already died from drought. It was necessary to choose a shortcut and bring the water to the fields as quickly as possible. He climbed to the top of the high Shigang Mountain and saw that not far away was the dried-up Nansha River. He thought, if the spring water could be diverted to the upper reaches of the Nansha River, allowing the water to flow downstream along the dried-up riverbed, then the rice would be saved. Ma Zhengchang stepped out a route for a water channel in the wild grass and rocks, which was only a little over ten miles long in total.

    The good news brought back by Ma Zhengchang encouraged the people of all ethnic groups. Under the leadership of the Party branch, everyone launched a four-day blitz, digging a channel on the edge of Shigang Mountain and diverting the spring water to the Nansha River. Water flowed through gate after gate, trickling into the cracked paddy fields, and the parched land made creaking sounds, and the sun-scorched rice leaves slowly unfolded.

    In June, the Pula people had a bumper harvest. Old man Yang You San looked at the golden rice with joy and said: I never thought that the rice that was about to die would have a bumper harvest. With water, we will settle down here.

        Setting an Example by Building Roads Around the Mountains
          Leading the Masses to Build Bullock Carts Themselves
    The Pula people lived on the mountain tops, but the fields they cultivated were at the foot of the mountains. It took more than ten miles to walk from the village to the fields along winding mountain paths. Transporting goods and delivering fertilizer was all done by carrying on their backs and heads, so little fertilizer was applied to the fields, resulting in lower yields.

    In January last year, the Honghe Commune Party Committee called for the resolute elimination of "white water fields" for rice paddies. Ma Zhengchang calculated that 4 million catties of fertilizer were needed for the 800 mu of rice fields in the entire Management Area. If half of the labor force in the area were used to carry it, it would take eight months to transport it all.

    Ma Zhengchang proposed the idea of using carts to transport fertilizer at a meeting of commune members. This was supported by most people, but some people opposed it, believing that it was difficult to build roads in the high mountains. Ma Zhengchang thought that he should first set an example, and people would believe it when they saw it. He first led some Party members and Youth League members to the fields, used bamboo poles and hemp ropes to measure out a route that spiraled down the mountain, and then asked Yi carpenter Yang Lao Ba to go down the mountain to learn how to build ox carts from Han carpenters. After three days of intensive work, a bullock cart road more than ten miles long was built. Ma Zhengchang personally pulled a cart of cow dung and sent it to the fields along the newly built road. The example he set encouraged the masses. As a result, people of all ethnic groups began to build roads, men and women became carpenters, and pine torches were lit at night to build bullock carts. In just four days, eleven roads were built and more than forty bullock carts were made in the entire Management Area, realizing cart transportation. In just half a month, the fertilizer accumulated in the village for decades was transported to the fields. The rice harvest that year was bountiful, with an average yield of more than 600 catties per mu.

      Two Private Schools Were Established in Puhua Village
        The Sound of Reading Echoed in the High Mountains
      "Quails don't climb trees, Pula people don't read." In the past, the Pula people here were illiterate and always used notched wood and knotted ropes to record events. When agricultural cooperatives were established, it was difficult to keep accounts, and the Yuanjiang County Committee often sent people to the mountains to help them keep accounts. After the commune was established, two Han cadres were sent to work as accountants and statisticians. After Ma Zhengchang arrived at the Management Area, he assigned Dai Li, a Pula youth from the Natang Production Team, to work with these two Han cadres and learn culture from them. Ma Zhengchang often told Dai Li about the suffering of the Pula people in the past without culture. He said to Dai Li: "You are our first reader, you must study hard!" Dai Li studied very hard and often lit pine torches at night to read. In just one year, with the help of Han comrades, Dai Li learned to record work points, write notices, and read small newspapers. Now, Dai Li has become the first Pula accountant in the Nansha Management Area. This ended the history of the Pula people using notched wood to record events.

    Last year, Ma Zhengchang also helped the two Han cadres establish two private schools in Puhua Village, where more than 30 Yi children went to school. The sound of reading echoed in the high mountains.

    Greatly Encouraged by Meeting Chairman Mao
      Determined to Accelerate the Construction of the Frontier Mountainous Area
    Ma Zhengchang is the militia instructor of the Management Area. Because of his outstanding achievements in harnessing mountains and rivers and spreading culture, he represented the militia of all ethnic groups in Yuanjiang County at the National Militia Representative Conference in April this year. From the first day he arrived in Beijing, he wanted to meet Chairman Mao. He thought: In the past, the Kuomintang said, "Eggs don't count as meat, Pula people don't count as people." We Pula people stood up only with Chairman Mao; only with Chairman Mao did our poor mountain ravine change its appearance, have the fragrance of rice, and have the sound of reading.... When he actually saw Chairman Mao in Beijing, his eyes were moist. He felt that this was the happiest moment of his life.

    Ma Zhengchang was the first Pula person to see Chairman Mao. After returning to his hometown, he told the commune members of all ethnic groups about Chairman Mao's teachings and his kind face and smile, again and again, and everyone listened with fascination. The commune members said: We must be worthy of Chairman Mao's people, we must do a good job in unity, do a good job in production, and accelerate the construction of the frontier mountainous areas.

    不畏困难带领群众治山治水  在仆拉人中间传播文化知识
    马正昌树立建设山区榜样
    万山千壑找到了水源
    仆拉人结束迁徙生活
    4月的红河，晴空万里无云，没有一丝雨意。云南省红河边的元江坝子里，空气十分干燥，眼看谷子快要旱死了。元江县红河人民公社南沙管理区的社员天天从南沙河里、井里提水浇田，但阻止不了旱情的继续发展。
    居住在这里的仆拉人（彝族，下同）由于干旱，解放前时常迁徙，哪里有水就住在哪里，水干了又搬走。这次大旱是过去少有的，已经延续了二百多天。老人杨有三感叹地说：“我们又要搬家了。”不少社员的思想也有些动荡。
    南沙管理区的中共支部书记、仆拉人马正昌，召集了党员和团员在那塘村前的草坪上开了会。他说：“眼下谷子要旱死了，有人想丢了谷子搬家。你们的意思怎么样？”大家都表示不愿意搬家。但是，想什么办法弄到水呢？
    马正昌鼓励他们说：“我们要依靠党、依靠公社，找出水来，战胜干旱。”党、团员们的信心坚定了，都表示要带领群众和干旱作斗争。
    当时，最重要的问题是要找到水，救活受旱的谷子。马正昌和管理区的几个干部分头去找水源。他背起铜锣锅，带着大米、砍刀、火药枪，在红河南岸的万山千壑里转。饿了，就在山野里烧起火，找到些许泉水煮一锅饭，拣一点野菜，打几只野味吃。就这样从这座山走到那条岭，终于发现了一处由密林里奔流出来的山泉。他跳进水里，一边洗、一边喝、一边高兴地喊。但这股山泉离稻田至少有几十里，等到修起一条沟来，稻子早已旱死了。必须选择一条捷径，用最快的速度把水引到田里去。他登上高高的石干山，看到不远处就是干涸了的南沙河。他想，如果能把泉水引到南沙河的上游，使水沿着干涸的河床顺流而下，那稻子就得救了。马正昌在荒草乱石中用脚踏勘出一条水渠的线路，一共只有十多里长。
    马正昌带回来的好消息，鼓舞了各族社员。大家在党支部的领导下，突击了四天，在石干山边挖出了一条渠道，把泉水引到了南沙河。水，流过一道道闸门，淌进了龟裂的稻田，久旱的土地发出吱吱的响声，晒卷了的禾叶慢慢地舒展开来了。
    6月，仆拉人丰收了。杨有三老人看着黄金般的稻谷高兴地说：真没想到，快死的稻子得到了丰收。有了水，我们就在这里扎下根了。
        盘山修路作出样板
          带领群众自造牛车
    仆拉人住在山头上，他们种的田却在山脚下，从村里到田间要走十多里长的羊肠小路，运东西、送肥料都是人背头顶，因而田里施肥很少，产量较低。
    去年1月，红河公社党委号召坚决消灭水稻白水田。马正昌算了一笔账，全管理区的八百亩稻田要施四百万斤肥料，如用全区一半的劳动力背运，要八个月才运完。
    马正昌在社员大会上提出了运肥车子化的主张，得到了多数人的拥护，但也有人反对，认为高山修路有困难。马正昌想，应该先作个样子出来，人们看到就相信了。他首先带领一部分党、团员到田里，用竹竿和麻绳测出一条盘旋下山的线路，又让彝族木匠杨老八下山向汉族木匠学习造牛车。经过三天的突击，修成一条十多里长的牛车路。马正昌亲自拉着一车牛粪，沿着新修的路送往田里。他作出的榜样鼓舞了群众，于是，各族社员都修起路来，男男女女都当木匠，晚上燃起松明造牛车。只四天工夫，全管理区就修了十一条路，制成四十多辆牛车，实现了车子化。只半个月时间，便把村子里积攒了几十年的肥料都运到了田里。这一年的水稻得到了大丰收，平均亩产六百多斤。
      普花寨办起了两所民校
        高山上有了读书的声音
      “鹌鹑不上树、仆拉不读书。”过去，这里的仆拉人没有识字的，一直沿用刻木和结绳记事的办法。办农业社时，算账有困难，元江县委经常派人上山帮助他们算账，公社化以后又派了两个汉族干部去当会计和统计员。马正昌到管理区以后，指定那塘生产队的仆拉青年戴立和这两个汉族干部一起工作，并向他们学文化。马正昌常给戴立讲过去仆拉人没有文化的苦处。他对戴立说：“你是我们的第一个读书人，要发愤用功才好！”戴立学习很努力，夜晚常常燃起松明读书。只一年工夫，戴立在汉族同志的帮助下，就学会了记工分、写通知、看小报。现在，戴立已经成为南沙管理区的第一名仆拉人会计。从此结束了仆拉人刻木记事的历史。
    去年，马正昌又帮助那两位汉族干部在普花小寨办了两所民校，有三十多个彝族少年到学校里学习。高山上有了读书的声音。
    见到毛主席受到极大鼓舞
      决心加速建设好边疆山区
    马正昌是管理区的民兵教导员。由于他在治山、治水和传播文化方面的卓越成就，今年4月，他代表元江县各族民兵出席了全国民兵代表会议。他从到北京的第一天起就想见毛主席。他想：以前国民党说“鸡蛋不算肉，仆拉不算人。”我们仆拉人有了毛主席，才站起来了；有了毛主席，我们那个穷山沟才变了样，才有了稻米香、有了读书声……。当他在北京真的见到毛主席时，他的眼睛湿润了。他感觉到这是他一生中最幸福的时刻。
    马正昌是第一个见到毛主席的仆拉人。他回到家乡后，把毛主席的教导和他老人家的音容笑貌，一遍又一遍地讲给各民族的社员听，人人都听得入了迷。社员们说：我们要不愧为毛主席的人民，要搞好团结，搞好生产，加速建设好边疆的山区。
