Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 29th -- General Xu Fengxue, Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, hosted a banquet at Okryu Hall in Pyongyang this evening to warmly welcome the Chinese People's Liberation Army Performing Arts Troupe, led by the PRC Military Friendship Delegation to Korea.

Attending the banquet were: Vice Minister of National Defense of Korea, General Shi Shishan, and other senior generals of the People's Army, Vice Chairman of the Korean Democratic People's Republic Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations Choi Sung-sook, Vice Minister of Education and Culture Zhao Lingchu, Director of the Third Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Xu Xixin, and famous Korean artists such as People's Artist Huang Che, Honored Artists An Shengji, An Jiyu, and Wen Yifeng.

Colonel Wang Yongnian, head of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Performing Arts Troupe, Colonel Li Gan, political commissar, Lieutenant Colonel Li Saizhong, deputy head, Lieutenant Colonel Wei Feng, deputy political commissar, and all members of the troupe attended the banquet. Cultural Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Korea Li Lin, Military Attaché Colonel Zhang Leting, and others were also invited to attend the banquet.

General Xu Fengxue delivered a speech at the banquet, first expressing his heartfelt welcome to all comrades of the art troupe. He pointed out that the people and armies of China and Korea are allies who have worked together in the long-term common struggle against imperialism, and are close brothers closely united on the basis of Marxist-Leninist thought and principles. He said that today, the battle friendship between the people and armies of China and Korea has been strengthened as never before, becoming an invincible force. This battle friendship and unity cannot be destroyed by any force and is eternal.

Xu Fengxue said that the performances of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Performing Arts Troupe have left a deep impression on the people of Pyongyang and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army. Through this performance, we deeply feel that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, China's culture and art are developing brilliantly and have achieved brilliant achievements. At the same time, we have also experienced the vivid and lively life of the Chinese people, who are continuing to make great leaps forward in socialist construction, and their strong defenders—the Chinese People's Liberation Army—as well as their friendship towards the Korean people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army. He emphasized that the song of friendship you sing will be warmly welcomed by the officers and soldiers of the People's Army everywhere and will greatly encourage the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army who are guarding the eastern outpost of the socialist camp together with the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Colonel Wang Yongnian then delivered a speech. He first expressed his gratitude for the warm hospitality of the hosts. He said that since stepping on your beautiful land, we have been warmly welcomed and kindly received everywhere. All this makes us deeply realize that the battle friendship between the Korean and Chinese people cemented in blood is truly higher than the mountains and deeper than the sea, and no force can destroy it. He then enthusiastically praised the achievements made by the Korean people and the People's Army in socialist construction.

Wang Yongnian said: Our two peoples are close brothers, and the armies of the two countries are close comrades-in-arms. Our two countries will always unite closely, support each other, learn from each other, and advance together in the cause of opposing US imperialist aggression and building socialism. We firmly believe that the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people will surely be further consolidated and developed as time goes on.

The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere.
