    "Embargo" Cannot Stop the Advance of the Cuban Revolution
    By People's Daily Commentator

    On October 19th, the U.S. government ordered a complete “embargo” against Cuba. At the same time, the United States also revised its export control regulations to prevent the indirect shipment of American goods and technical data to Cuba, and prohibited the sale, transfer, or lease of American-owned ships to Cuban enterprises. This is a new conspiracy by the U.S. imperialists, who insist on being hostile to the Cuban people, to strangle the Cuban revolution with an economic blockade.

    Recently, U.S. imperialism has stepped up its sinister activities to subvert the Cuban revolutionary regime. While organizing sabotage activities by spies and armed bandits, the upper echelons of the U.S. ruling clique and their propaganda machines have repeatedly clamored for further action to overthrow the Cuban revolutionary regime. On October 18, U.S. Vice President Nixon, at a rally in Miami, the center of opposition to the Cuban revolution, vigorously advocated that the United States should "take the toughest possible economic measures very quickly" to deal with Cuba. Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy also clamored at the same rally that the United States should intensify its policy of aggression against Cuba. Prior to this, on the 15th, Kennedy also put forward a "five-point plan" for aggression and subversion against Cuba, blatantly advocating that the United States should "restrict, isolate, and stifle" Cuba. The recent comprehensive “embargo” against Cuba once again shows that U.S. imperialism is not reconciled to its past failures, and is intensifying its efforts to adopt various means—military, economic, open, and secret—in an attempt to destroy revolutionary Cuba.

    The development of things always goes in the opposite direction to the wishes of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism believes that through a comprehensive “embargo,” it can create immense economic difficulties for Cuba, and even bring the Cuban people to their deaths. However, the Cuban people, who have already stood up, will never bow their knees under the pressure of U.S. imperialism. The “embargo” can hardly stop the continued advance of the Cuban revolution. Premier Castro, in a speech as early as February of this year, emphasized that the country's economic problems should be solved with its own resources. He also pointed out that the only way for the people of all countries to solve their "economic ills" is to fight against the foreign forces that exploit them and prevent their progress. The Cuban revolutionary government and the Cuban people have learned from their own experience that relying on self-reliance and resolutely advancing the revolution are the thorough and most reliable ways to deal with the economic pressure of U.S. imperialism, overcome economic difficulties, and develop the national economy.

    In the twenty-one months since the victory of the revolution, the Cuban people have bravely and firmly moved forward along this correct path of maintaining national independence and developing the national economy in the struggle to kick away the American aggressors and constantly crush American aggression and interference. Therefore, although U.S. imperialism has continuously wielded the "economic big stick" against Cuba since the first day of the Cuban revolution, from stopping "aid," destroying fuel production, restricting trade with Cuba, to reducing the quota of sugar imports from Cuba, it has tried everything possible to strangle the Cuban revolution from the economic front. However, the Cuban revolution has not only failed to stop its progress but has continued to develop. The Cuban economy has not stagnated or collapsed but has shown an unprecedentedly prosperous scene. The Cuban revolutionary government and the Cuban people have responded to every step of aggression, interference, and sabotage by U.S. imperialism with tit-for-tat struggles. Now, all the cultivated land in Cuba occupied by the United States has been taken over, and the major American enterprises in Cuba have been basically nationalized. The heroic spirit of the Cuban people in despising U.S. imperialism and daring to fight has won the admiration and support of the people of the world.

    Naturally, U.S. imperialism is not reconciled to its failure. The United States' implementation of a comprehensive “embargo” against Cuba is proof that, despite its repeated failures in its activities of interference and aggression against Cuba, it still wants to make trouble. In the past, Cuba suffered from long-term U.S. control and enslavement, resulting in a deformed economic structure and foreign trade that relied almost entirely on the United States. The United States attempts to use this situation to create difficulties for the Cuban economy through "blockade." But what does this count for compared to the difficulties of the Cuban people's armed struggle with bare hands? Moreover, the current situation and economic conditions in Cuba are very different from those at the beginning of the revolutionary victory. With the nationalization of large enterprises and private Cuban banks, the Cuban revolution is deepening further. Cuba has basically completed land reform, begun to establish its own national industry, and possesses the necessary resources and basic industries for the development of the national economy. At the same time, the Cuban revolutionary government has developed and established trade relations with countries around the world, especially socialist countries, and has begun to change the situation of completely relying on the American market in trade before the revolution. These internal and external conditions are conducive to Cuba's economic transformation and construction. We firmly believe that the Cuban people will smash the economic "blockade" of U.S. imperialism and enable the Cuban economy to develop more rapidly and healthily. And this act of aggression by U.S. imperialism can only further expose it as the enemy of the Cuban people and the enemy of the people of all countries.

    “禁运”阻挡不住古巴革命前进
    本报评论员
    10月19日，美国政府下令对古巴实行全面“禁运”。与此同时，美国还修改了它的出口管制条例，以阻止把美国商品和技术资料间接运入古巴，并且禁止把美国人拥有的船只出售、转让或出租给古巴企业。这是坚持与古巴人民为敌的美帝国主义妄图用经济封锁扼杀古巴革命的新阴谋。
    最近以来，美帝国主义加紧了颠覆古巴革命政权的罪恶活动。在组织间谍和武装匪徒的破坏活动的同时，美国统治集团的上层人物和他们的御用宣传机器，一再叫嚣进一步采取行动，以推翻古巴革命政权。美国副总统尼克松18日在美国反对古巴革命的中心迈阿密的一个集会上，大力鼓吹美国要“非常迅速地采取尽可能强硬的经济措施”来对付古巴。民主党总统候选人肯尼迪在同一个集会上也叫嚷美国要加紧采取侵略古巴的政策。在这以前，肯尼迪在15日还提出了一个侵略和颠覆古巴的“五点计划”，露骨地主张美国要使古巴“受到限制、孤立和就地夭折”。最近对古巴实行的全面“禁运”，又一次表明了美帝国主义并不甘心于过去的失败，它正变本加厉地采取各种手段——军事的、经济的，公开的、秘密的，妄图摧毁革命的古巴。
    事物的发展，总是走向美帝国主义愿望的反面。美帝国主义认为通过全面“禁运”，就可以在经济上给古巴制造无比的困难，甚至可以致古巴人民于死地。但是，已经站起来了的古巴人民，是决不会在美帝国主义的压力下屈膝的。“禁运”决难阻挡古巴革命的继续前进。卡斯特罗总理早在今年2月间的一次讲话中，就强调要用自己的资源解决国家的经济问题。他并且指出，各国人民解决他们“经济不良现象”的唯一道路，是与剥削他们和阻止他们进步的外国势力作斗争。古巴革命政府和古巴人民已经从亲身经历中体会到：依靠自力更生，坚决推进革命，是对付美帝国主义的经济压力、克服经济困难和发展国民经济的彻底办法，也是最可靠的办法。
    革命胜利后二十一个多月以来，古巴人民就是在一脚踢开美国侵略者和不断粉碎美国侵略干涉的斗争中，沿着这个维护民族独立、发展民族经济的正确道路勇敢而坚定地向前迈进的。因此，尽管美帝国主义从古巴革命胜利第一天起，就不断对古巴挥舞“经济大棒”，从停止“援助”、破坏燃料生产、限制对古巴的贸易、一直到削减从古巴进口的食糖定额，无所不用其极地妄图从经济战线上绞杀古巴革命，但是，古巴革命不但没有停止前进，反而不断向前发展。古巴经济不但没有停滞和破产，反而呈现一片前所未有的欣欣向荣的景象。古巴革命政府和古巴人民，用针锋相对的斗争，来回答美帝国主义的每一个侵略、干涉和破坏步骤。现在，美国霸占古巴的耕地已全部被接管，美国在古巴的大企业也基本上被收归国有。古巴人民这种藐视美帝国主义，敢于斗争的英雄气概，赢得了全世界人民的敬佩和支持。
    自然，美帝国主义是不甘心它的失败的。美国对古巴实行全面“禁运”，正是证明，尽管它在干涉和侵略古巴的活动中不断遭到失败，但是仍然要进行捣乱。过去古巴遭受美国长时期的控制和奴役而造成了畸形的经济结构，以及对外贸易几乎完全依靠美国。美国企图利用这种情况，以“封锁”来给古巴经济制造困难。但是，同古巴人民赤手空拳地武装斗争时期的困难比较起来，这又算什么呢？何况今天的古巴形势、经济情况同革命胜利初期大不相同了。由于把大企业和古巴的私营银行收归国有，古巴革命正在进一步深入。古巴已经基本上完成了土地改革，开始建立起自己的民族工业，并且拥有发展民族经济所必要的资源和基础工业。与此同时，古巴革命政府发展和建立了同世界各国特别是社会主义国家的贸易关系，开始改变了革命前那种在贸易上完全依靠美国市场的情况。这些内外条件，都有利于古巴的经济改造和建设。我们深信，古巴人民一定会粉碎美帝国主义的经济“封锁”，使古巴经济更加迅速和健康地发展。而美帝国主义这一侵略行为，只能进一步暴露它是古巴人民的敌人，是世界各国人民的敌人。
