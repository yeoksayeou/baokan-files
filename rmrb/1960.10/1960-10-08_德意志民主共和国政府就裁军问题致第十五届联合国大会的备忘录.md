Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th - The following is the full text of the memorandum from the Government of the German Democratic Republic to the 15th UN General Assembly on the question of disarmament, dated September 15.

    Solving the problem of disarmament is the most important task of the people and governments of all countries today. The solution of this problem will eliminate the possibility of new wars and guarantee peace forever.

    Germany was the source of two world wars. This obligates the German people and the two German governments to make the greatest efforts to consolidate peace and prevent war. The Potsdam Agreement concluded by the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and France stipulated the eradication of militarism and revanchism so that other countries would never again be threatened by Germany.

    The Government of the German Democratic Republic has always believed that the appropriate contribution of the two Germanies must be that they immediately begin comprehensive and complete disarmament in Germany.

    In view of West Germany's pursuit of complete militarization and atomic arms expansion, it is urgently necessary to rapidly implement disarmament measures in Germany. The West German Federal Government is grossly violating the principles established by the anti-fascist Allies at the end of World War II for the establishment of a demilitarized and peace-loving Germany. It refuses to recognize the outcome of World War II. It makes territorial claims against many countries in Europe and rejects a policy of peaceful coexistence.

    The Hitler generals who are once again in command in West Germany have put forward a program for West Germany's full remilitarization in a memorandum. Among other things, it calls for the forced conscription of all able-bodied male residents, the unlimited expansion of the Bundeswehr with nuclear weapons, rockets, and the most modern jet aircraft, the demand for a strong Bundesmarine with no tonnage or armament restrictions, and finally, the demand to move the Bundeswehr and its transportation links far beyond the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from the Federal Republic. The generals' memorandum, which was formulated and published with the full agreement of the West German government, proves that they are preparing for rocket and atomic warfare. Accompanied by this arms policy, the agitation and clamor of West German revanchist organizations are also increasing day by day. Moreover, ministers of the West German government are actually speakers at all important agitation meetings, thereby confirming that West German revanchism has been elevated to a national policy. Atomic armament and revanchism not only seriously violate the Potsdam Agreement and the United Nations Charter, but also violate the unconditional surrender treaty signed by the Supreme Command of the Hitler Wehrmacht. The generals of the current command headquarters of the West German Bundeswehr were also members of the Supreme Command of the Hitler Wehrmacht.

    The West German Federal Government's extensive arms expansion measures and increasing war incitement have made West Germany a potentially very dangerous source of war. This source of war threatens the peace of the German people, the peace of the peoples of Europe, and world peace.

    Therefore, disarmament measures in Germany must be taken most rapidly in order to maintain peace. It will contribute to the emergence of a neutral Germany, thereby preventing war in Europe. Comprehensive and complete disarmament will be very much in the national interest of the German people. The mere beginning of the implementation of the first effective disarmament measures would eliminate the main obstacles that currently prevent the two Germanies from reaching an understanding on reunification.

    The focus of the 15th UN General Assembly will be the Soviet government's proposal to discuss and adopt comprehensive and complete disarmament. Out of a desire to make a constructive contribution to comprehensive disarmament, and out of responsibility for peace and the national interests of the German people, the Government of the German Democratic Republic hereby submits the following proposals to the 15th UN General Assembly regarding the phased implementation of comprehensive and complete disarmament in the two Germanies:

    A. Comprehensive and complete disarmament of the two Germanies in three phases:

    First Phase (1960-1961)

    (1) The two Germanies shall renounce the use of force against each other and against third countries by means of declarations bound by international law. This declaration shall be kept by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

    (2) The two Germanies agree to cease armaments. They guarantee to maintain the original levels without seeking to continue to strengthen them after announcing their armed forces and armament levels.

    (3) The two Germanies shall renounce atomic armament. They guarantee that they will not produce nuclear weapons and missile weapons, will not participate in the production or acquisition and reception of such weapons by other countries, and will not participate in nuclear weapons tests by other countries.

    The storage of other foreign atomic weapons must be stopped immediately.

    (4) The two Germanies guarantee that they will not produce chemical and biological weapons, will not participate in the production of such weapons by other countries, or in the acquisition and reception of these weapons, and will not participate in the testing of these weapons by other countries.

    (5) The two Germanies shall stop all war propaganda and propaganda making territorial claims against other countries on their own territories.

    (6) Conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanies and transform West Berlin into a demilitarized free city.

    For this purpose, the anti-Hitler coalition countries shall convene a peace conference with representatives from the two Germanies.

    Second Phase (1962)

      (1) The two Germanies shall reduce their armed forces and armaments. Idle armaments and materials should be destroyed or used for peaceful purposes. Reduce military spending. Negotiate the location of the remaining armed forces.

      (2) The two Germanies shall abolish compulsory military service. Abolish the West German law on the establishment of universal compulsory military service.

      (3) On the basis of the peace treaty concluded during this period, the four countries of the Potsdam Agreement shall consult with the two Germanies on the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the abolition of all foreign bases and armories, thereby eliminating all remnants of World War II and creating the most important preconditions for the realization of the German people's right to self-determination.

      (4) Destroy the existing missile weapons of the German armed forces.

    Third Phase (1963-1964)

      (1) Finally disband the armed forces of the two Germanies, completely destroy all kinds of weapons, ammunition and military equipment, or use them for peaceful purposes.

      (2) The two Germanies shall retain police forces to maintain domestic order and agree on the number, equipment and location of the police.

      (3) End military production in the two Germanies and convert the corresponding factories to peaceful production.

      (4) Dissolve all military institutions in the two Germanies (various departments, command headquarters, military academies, conscription bureaus, etc.).

      (5) The two Germanies shall withdraw separately from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization, so that Germany is not bound by military blocs. The two Germanies declare neutrality. Their neutrality is guaranteed by the main countries of the anti-Hitler alliance or the United Nations.

    B. Use of funds released by comprehensive and complete disarmament

    The two Germanies will use the funds released by disarmament to build housing, expand social facilities, increase pensions, and for scientific and cultural purposes, as well as to help economically underdeveloped countries.

    C. Supervisory measures. A supervisory body shall be established to monitor the implementation of the proposed measures. This body shall be composed of representatives of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Parliament of West Germany, as well as representatives of trade unions and other democratic mass organizations (such as women's federations, youth federations), with equal representation from both sides.

    The supervisory body shall begin work once the two Germanies reach an agreement or the United Nations makes a corresponding decision. It has full authority to supervise the implementation of disarmament in the two Germanies in accordance with the measures stipulated in each stage.

    D. Comprehensive and complete disarmament

    The two Germanies guarantee to participate in the international agreement on comprehensive and complete disarmament after it is reached and to fulfill all obligations arising from the agreement.

    The vast majority of the German people will welcome the UN General Assembly's resolution on comprehensive and complete disarmament with special provisions for German disarmament, considering it to be a decision of great significance for safeguarding peace through peaceful coexistence, which will also help them open the doors to the democratic and peaceful reunification of Germany. The reunification of Germany is a matter for the Germans themselves and the two Germanies. But reunification is conditional on disarmament and the conclusion of a peace treaty with the two Germanies.

    The signing of a peace treaty and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Germany in accordance with the provisions of the second phase of disarmament will create the most important preconditions for the exercise of the right to self-determination by the entire German people.

    The Government of the German Democratic Republic is convinced that its initiative for comprehensive and complete disarmament in the two Germanies is in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter. The Government of the German Democratic Republic is convinced that the 15th UN General Assembly will once again emphasize its support for comprehensive and complete disarmament. It hopes that the UN General Assembly will examine in depth the proposals of the Government of the German Democratic Republic on comprehensive and complete disarmament in the two Germanies and take these proposals into account in the corresponding resolutions to be adopted at its upcoming session.

    The Government of the German Democratic Republic is convinced that the United Nations' support for this initiative is not only in the interests of the German people, but also in the most fundamental interests of the peoples of all countries, and will help make the outbreak of war in the heart of Europe forever impossible.

    德意志民主共和国政府就裁军问题致第十五届联合国大会的备忘录
    新华社柏林7日电　9月15日德意志民主共和国政府就裁军问题致第十五届联合国大会的备忘录。全文如下：
    解决裁军问题是当前各国人民和政府最重要的任务。这个问题的解决将杜绝发生新战争的可能和永远保障和平。
    德国是两次世界大战的策源地。这使德国人民和两个德国政府有义务以极大的努力巩固和平和防止战争。由苏联、美国、英国和法国缔结的波茨坦协定规定根除军国主义和复仇主义以使他国人民永不再受德国的威胁。
    德意志民主共和国政府始终认为两个德国适当的贡献必须在于它们立刻在德国开始全面彻底裁军。
    鉴于西德追求全面军国主义化和原子扩军备战，在德国迅速实现裁军措施证明是迫切必要的。西德联邦政府粗暴地破坏反法西斯同盟国在第二次世界大战结束时为建立一个非军事化和爱好和平的德国而制定的原则。它拒绝承认第二次世界大战的结局。它向欧洲的很多国家提出领土要求，并且拒绝和平共处政策。
    在西德重又发号施令的希特勒将领们在一份备忘录中提出了西德再度全面军国主义化的纲领。其中要求强迫征募能服军役的全部男性居民，用核武器、火箭武装以及用最现代的喷气式飞机无限地扩大联邦国防军的武装，要求有强大的、不受吨位和武装限制的联邦海军，最后还要求调动联邦国防军并将其交通联络推进到远离联邦共和国的北大西洋集团成员国中去。在西德政府的完全同意之下而制定和公布的将军们的备忘录证明了他们在准备火箭和原子战争。伴随着这个军备政策，西德复仇主义组织的煽动叫嚣也日渐增多。而且西德政府的部长们竟是所有重要的煽动集会上的发言人，从而确认西德的复仇主义已提高成了国策。原子军备和复仇主义不仅严重地违反波茨坦协定和联合国宪章，而且也违反希特勒国防军最高司令部所签署的无条件投降条约。而西德联邦国防军现时的指挥司令部的将领们也曾是属于希特勒国防军最高司令部的。
    西德联邦政府广泛的扩军措施和日益加强的战争煽动使西德成了一个可能是非常危险的战争策源地。这个战争策源地威胁着德国人民的和平，也威胁着欧洲各国人民的和平和世界和平。
    因此，为维持和平就必须最迅速地有德国的裁军措施。它将促成两个德国的中立的产生，从而防止在欧洲发生战争。全面和彻底裁军将非常符合德国人民的民族利益。只消开始实行最初的有效的裁军措施，就会取消目前使两个德国不能就重新统一达成谅解的主要障碍。
    第十五届联合国大会的中心将是苏联政府提出的建议：讨论和通过全面、彻底裁军。德意志民主共和国政府出于欲对全面裁军作出建设性贡献的愿望，和对和平以及德国人民的民族利益的责任，兹向第十五届联合国大会提出关于在两个德国分阶段实现全面和彻底裁军的下列建议：
    甲、两个德国分三阶段全面彻底裁军：
    第一阶段（1960—1961）
    （1）两个德国通过受国际公法约束的声明来放弃在相互之间和对第三国使用武力。此声明由联合国秘书长保存。
    （2）两个德国商定停止军备。它们保证在公布它们的武装力量和军备水平后维持原有水平而不图求继续加强。
    （3）两个德国放弃原子军备。它们保证自己不生产核武器和导弹武器，不参加他国的此种武器的生产或获取与接收这些武器以及不参加他国的核武器试验。
    立即停止存放外国的其他原子武器。
    （4）两个德国保证不生产化学武器和生物武器，不参加他国的此种武器的生产，或获取与接收这些武器以及不参加他国的这些武器的试验。
    （5）两个德国制止在自己的领土上作任何战争宣传和向别国提出领土要求的宣传。
    （6）与两个德国缔结和约和变西柏林为一个非军事化的自由城市。
    为此目的，反希特勒联盟国家召开一次有两个德国的代表参加的和会。
    第二阶段（1962）
      （1）两个德国裁减它们的武装力量和军备。空闲的军备物资应予销毁或用于和平用途。削减军费。协商遗留下的武装力量的驻扎地点。
      （2）两个德国取消义务兵役。废除西德关于设立普遍义务兵役制的法律。
      （3）在此期间已缔结和约的基础上，签订波茨坦协定的四国同两个德国协商撤退一切外国军队和取消一切外国基地和军火库，从而消灭第二次世界大战的一切残余，为实现德国人民的自决权创造最重要的前提。
      （4）销毁德国武装力量现有的导弹武器。
    第三阶段（1963—1964）
      （1）最后解散两个德国的武装力量，完全销毁各种武器、弹药和军事工具或将它们用于和平用途。
      （2）两个德国保留警察力量以维持国内秩序，并商定警察的人数、装备和驻扎地。
      （3）结束两个德国的军事生产，将相应的工厂转入和平生产。
      （4）在两个德国解散一切军事机构（各个主管部门、司令部、军事学院、征兵局等等）。
      （5）两个德国分别退出北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织，从而使德国不受军事集团的约束。两个德国宣布中立。它们的中立受反希特勒联盟的主要国家或联合国保证。
    乙、由于全面彻底裁军而腾出来的资金的使用
    两个德国将使用由于裁军而腾出来的资金来建筑住宅、扩大社会设施、提高养老金和用于科学文化目的以及用于帮助经济不发达国家。
    丙、监督措施　　为监督执行所建议的措施而建立一个监督机构。此机构由德意志民主共和国人民议院和西德联邦议院的代表以及工会及其他民主的群众组织（如妇女联合会、青年联合会）的代表组成，双方的代表相等。
    一旦两个德国达成协议或联合国方面作出相应的决定，监督机构即开始工作。它有一切全权，根据各个阶段规定的措施监督执行两个德国的裁军。
    丁、全面彻底裁军
    两个德国保证在达成关于全面彻底裁军的国际协定后参加这项协定并履行因协定而产生的一切义务。
    德国人民的绝大多数将会欢迎联合国大会作出附有德国裁军特别条款的全面彻底裁军的决议，认为它是对通过和平共处保障和平有重大意义的决定，这同时将会帮助他们打开实现德国的民主、和平的重新统一的大门。德国的重新统一是德国人民自己和两个德国的事情。但是重新统一是以裁军和与两个德国缔结和约为前提的。
    和约的签订和按照裁军第二阶段的规定从德国撤退一切外国军队，将会为全体德国人民行使自决权创造最重要的前提。
    德意志民主共和国政府确信，它倡议两个德国实行全面彻底裁军是符合联合国宪章的精神的。德意志民主共和国政府确信，第十五届联合国大会将再次强调赞成全面彻底裁军。它希望联合国大会深入考查德意志民主共和国政府关于两个德国实行全面彻底裁军的建议并在即将召开的会议所作出的相应决议中考虑这些建议。
    德意志民主共和国政府坚信，联合国支持这个倡议不仅符合德国人民的利益，同时并符合各国人民最根本的利益，并会有助于使欧洲心脏的战争爆发永远成为不可能。
