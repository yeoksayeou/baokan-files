Forty Years of Struggle for Peace, Democracy and Socialism
—Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of Australia
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Australia, Xia Qi
In the forty years since its founding, the Communist Party of Australia has stood at the forefront of the international struggle to defend peace and democracy.

The Communist Party of Australia has played a leading role in the struggle against the various wars waged by the imperialists during this period. Today, this noble struggle culminates in the fight to declare nuclear weapons illegal, to achieve disarmament and peaceful coexistence between the socialist and capitalist parts of the world, against colonial wars and against the conspiracies of aggressive militaristic organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Before the founding of the Communist Party of Australia, there already existed a tradition of opposition to war established by heroic socialist groups—the forerunners of the Communist Party—as well as outstanding members of various trade unions and the Australian Labor Party. This situation can be traced back to the South African War—a blatant example of an unjust imperialist war—and earlier colonial wars.

After this came the historic victories of the two anti-conscription movements and the great general strike of 1917 during the First World War. The reasons for the anti-conscription movement and the general strike were undoubtedly due to opposition to the appalling massacres and dissatisfaction with the protracted war that increasingly worsened the conditions of the working class.

The heroic socialist groups that later established the Communist Party played a heroic role in the aforementioned historic struggles.

The author began to take an interest in politics, attended anti-conscription rallies, distributed anti-conscription leaflets and documents, and supported the 1917 strikers in his hometown, the fiercely contested Orangi district.

Then came the greatest event of all historical events—the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia led by Lenin and the Bolshevik Party.

Soviet Russia was then under attack by the armies of fourteen imperialist countries headed by Britain, the United States, France, and Japan, which also used the troops of the German Emperor and Hindenburg, whom they had previously called "beasts" and "animals."

The response of Australian fighters and socialists was to form "Hands Off Russia" committees and to conduct a strong movement to defend the Soviet Union and oppose Churchill's intervention. The communist groups occupied a prominent place in the leadership. Later, these groups officially established the Communist Party of Australia on October 30, 1920. It continued this struggle until this intervention was repelled by the glorious Red Army of workers and peasants.

The Communists also strongly supported James Connolly's heroic uprising and the Sinn Fein anti-imperial revolution that ended with the establishment of the Irish Republic.

Our party was born in struggle, in protest against imperialist wars and imperialist intervention, in the 1917 general strike movement, in the defense of workers' rights, and in the struggle against conscription. (The struggle against conscription defended the basic democratic freedoms of the Australian masses, which would undoubtedly have been seriously threatened if the far-reaching conscription bill had been implemented.)

Another important democratic victory at the time was the victory of the twelve members of the Industrial Workers of the World organization. They were falsely accused and sentenced to up to fifteen years in prison in retaliation for their heroic anti-war activities.

After a long period of struggle and agitation, the Labor government of New South Wales established a Royal Commission, which released these twelve working-class fighters after they had served five years in prison.

The heroic example of the Russian working class and the writings and speeches of Lenin, which began to reach Australia, convinced the Australian working class that a Leninist party must be established in order for the Australian working class to fight for peace, democracy, higher living standards, and, most importantly, to achieve the victory of socialism in our country.

Our party expresses its internationalist views and principles not only in words but also in deeds. Therefore, from the very beginning, our party supported the great mass movement of the Chinese people against imperialism, which reached its peak after the end of the Great War and the victory of the Russian Revolution. The imperialists, for whom it was "natural," tried to crush the awakened Chinese people with brutal force.

We launched a movement to condemn the Shameen Massacre, in which British imperialists opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in Guangzhou, killing and wounding large numbers of patriots, workers, peasants, students and others who demanded that the imperialists get out of their motherland. We also launched movements to condemn the "Christian" robbers when they repeatedly bombed undefended Chinese cities in order to "teach" the "heathens" a "lesson."

Our party launched a movement to defend the Chinese revolution and successfully developed "Hands off China" committees on the basis of a broad united front. This committee supported the long struggle of the Chinese people to eradicate from their land the foreign imperialists of the United States, Britain, Japan, and virtually the entire pack of colonial wolves. These wolves divided China's territory, quarrelled with each other, and bribed Chinese warlords to fight for them.

I remember meeting a Chinese comrade in Moscow in 1930, who said that he very much enjoyed the speech I made on behalf of the Hands Off China Committee. I asked him how he had heard my speech, and he replied: "On that Sunday, I was in the Sydney area, attending the rally where you gave your speech." It turned out that he was a seaman on a ship that was docked in the port at the time. I thanked him on behalf of the committee and assured him that we would continue to support the just cause of the Chinese people in their struggle for national independence.

In 1925, the Party and militant workers had the opportunity to express their international solidarity. This was in support of the great strike of British sailors. At that time, the conference hall on Sussex Street and the offices of the party branches in major cities were used to accommodate the sailors, and we also prepared beds and food for them.

At that time, the Party, in its own newspapers and through various mass rallies, organized a strong propaganda movement to defend the striking British sailors with Australian sailors and other trade unionists.

This strike—not only here, but in ports around the world—lasted for several weeks, and the sailors achieved certain victories as a result.

In 1926, the reactionary Bruce government (now a member of the Upper House) enacted political and industrial amendments to the Federal Criminal Act, which were aimed at the Communist Party and the labor movement. The Attorney-General at the time, Sir Letham, a member of the so-called "Committee to Defend Cultural Freedom," later "strengthened" these amendments.

The Party immediately took action to launch a movement against the Criminal Act and the anti-labor amendments. Later, the Australian Council of Trade Unions resolutely demanded the abolition of the anti-working class clauses in this malicious legislation. The Federal Labor Party at the time also promised to abolish these amendments. Since then, there have been three Federal Labor governments—Scullin, Curtin, and Chifley—but these "amendments" have been left untouched.

In fact, twenty-three years after I participated in the first movement against the Criminal Act, I, like some others, became a victim of this act at the hands of the Chifley government. Despite the Labor Party's formal promise to abolish it over the past twenty years.

It was also in the early days of the Party's founding that we advocated the establishment of a pan-Australian trade union leadership organization. The right-wingers opposed this proposal. But after a long struggle within the labor movement, the Australian Council of Trade Unions was finally established.

All this shows the true nature of our Party—let the enemy slander us as they please. It shows our Party's principled attitude of opposing reactionary wars, imperialist colonialist violence, striving for national independence for all countries, defending Australian democracy as it did in the movement against the Criminal Act, strengthening our country's labor movement, and consistently adhering to internationalism based on the doctrines of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

The tactics of the Australian reactionaries, like those elsewhere, are to attack the people's democratic freedoms under the banner of anti-communism.

All reactionary forces, first and foremost monopoly capitalism—which, as Lenin pointed out, always strives to resort to reactionary tactics and violence—and its helpers, right-wingers, factionalists, the majority of pastors of all factions, traitors, and other assorted scoundrels, created the myth of the "red demon" and launched an attack on the Communist Party. But hidden behind this is an all-out attack on the freedom of the working people. Both domestically and internationally, they attempt to hide this behind a poisonous fog woven from lies, slander, and distortions of communism.

This was the case from the 1926 Criminal Act to the Petrov Commission.

In addition to engaging in the struggle against the Criminal Act amendments, an important movement launched by the Party in its early days was against the ban on the import of overseas printed matter. This movement lasted for a long period. The reactionaries attempted to prevent the Australian working class from learning about the achievements of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and the progress of the labor movement in other countries. But this reactionary ban, this thought control, was finally defeated.

With the rise of Fascism, especially after the establishment of the Hitler dictatorship in Germany by monopoly capitalists headed by Krupp, a new period of struggle to defend peace and democracy unfolded, which was of paramount importance to the Party and the Australian people.

The first major movement to alert workers to the trend towards a new world war and the fascist threat was sparked by the arrival in Australia in late 1934 of the representative to the Anti-War Congress, Egon Kisch. The reactionary government at the time did not allow him to land. The members of this reactionary government were so-called "liberals," who hung the banner of the "United Australia Party" headed by the Labor traitor Lyons.

Kisch jumped ashore from the ship, injuring his leg severely. During the legal proceedings, he "hid" for a period of time. Due to mass pressure and a resounding movement, he was finally allowed to stay together with a representative from New Zealand, Griffin. Those who remember the scenes of the warm welcome given to Kisch and Griffin by the masses, their appearances in the Sydney area, and Kisch's inspiring speeches—Kisch himself having suffered persecution by the Nazis, exposing and condemning the reign of terror in Germany and the ways in which Fascists, monopoly capitalists and militarists were trying to provoke a new world war—will forever cherish these memories.

Kisch strongly supported the Soviet government's policy, which called for non-fascist countries to establish a collective security system to block the path of fascism and war.

Kisch's visit was a memorable event. His visit paved the way for the Communist Party and all peace-loving people to launch a long and unwavering movement to defend peace, oppose fascism, and strive to uphold and expand democracy.

If the imperialist countries led by the United States and Britain had supported the collective security system, it would have been highly possible to avoid the outbreak of the Second World War and finally overthrow fascism. However, these countries rejected the collective security system, concluded the Munich Agreement, allowed Hitler to seize Czechoslovakia, swallow Austria, intervene in Spain and establish a fascist dictatorship there, thus making war inevitable. They would rather support Hitler, hoping that he would destroy the Soviet Union.

Our Party has consistently fought to uphold peace and collective security, to strive for an alliance with the Soviet people, and to support the heroic struggle of the Spanish democrats against fascism.

It is a fact that the right-wing leaders of the Labor Party also refused to support the collective security system against the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo axis. This short-sighted position contributed to the Fascists' provocation of war. They too were victims of anti-communism.

The Party was far from immune to attack as it engaged in anti-war propaganda, exposing the reactionaries and those who acted as accomplices of fascism. The reactionaries organized a fascist group called "New Guard," which did not hesitate to use force to attack Party rallies and beat up anti-fascists when they outnumbered them. The author was beaten and thrown into a creek, and many other workers across the country were also brutally beaten.

Workers' defense groups were formed and often inflicted blows on the Fascists that they did not expect.

The Fascists also began to attack Labor Party demonstrations in support of the policies of Lang, who was then the Premier of New South Wales. Workers' defense groups helped Labor Party workers deal with the so-called "New Guard"—imitators of Hitler and Mussolini—on these occasions.

The police were not idle either, and many militants were arrested and imprisoned during this period.

The Party was attacked by the federal government for its vigorous struggle for peace and against fascism. In 1932, legal proceedings were instituted against Harold Devanny, the publisher of the "Workers' Weekly." If this lawsuit had been successful, it would have outlawed the Communist Party. Once again, after a broad mass movement, the High Court finally ruled against the government.

In 1935, action was again taken to ban the Communist Party and the "Society of Friends of the Soviet Union." But under mass pressure, this action was abandoned. If the government had succeeded, the voices of the Party and non-Party peace fighters would have been stifled.

This, and many similar examples in our own history, illustrates the close relationship between war preparations and anti-communism, and the corresponding attacks by the reactionaries on democracy itself. This close relationship was equally clearly manifested in the "Communist Party Dissolution Act" and the "Petrov Commission." People realized this and rejected both.

When the war began as a result of the conspiracies of the imperialists and Fascists, Hitler, contrary to their hopes, did not "go east" but attacked the West.

For a long time, it was called the "phony war." The Communist Party, due to the imperialist nature of this war, opposed it in the early stages of the war. This time, the Menzies government succeeded in banning the Communist Party because the Party constantly fought for peace and exposed fascism and reactionaries at home and abroad. Despite this ban, the Communist Party was able to carry on its activities.

During this period, two Communists—Towers and Ratliff—were detained for distributing leaflets to the masses. The leaflet stated that those who refused to form an alliance with the Soviet Union were responsible for Hitler's aggression. The movement was successful and the two fighters were finally released.

The Nazi's aim was to rule the world. The Soviet Union was the main obstacle to achieving this goal. Hitler ordered an attack on the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union met blow with blow. For the first time, the Nazi war machine was stopped.

Now there was a worldwide alliance of anti-fascist forces. This alliance, which we had been striving for since 1933 and which had been undermined by the Western imperialist countries, changed the nature of the war.

The Soviet Union bore the brunt of the world struggle against fascism. The Party launched a movement to give the fullest support to the Red Army and the Soviet people. In particular, it fought vigorously to open a second front in order to bring the war to a swift end. A second front was not opened for the Soviet forces because the Churchill government and the United States hoped to exhaust the Soviet Union so that when peace was achieved, they would be able to impose their own terms.

When Japanese imperialism launched its offensive, the Party called on workers to support the struggle with all their might, to defeat Japanese imperialism.

When our Party was making strenuous efforts to defeat Hitler and the Japanese militarist fascists, about four thousand members of our Party were serving in the armed forces. At the same time, our Party gave its full support to the Soviet Union, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all other forces fighting the fascist Axis. Therefore, the Party fulfilled its duty. Because it believed that if fascism triumphed over the democratic alliance, it would be a return to the dark ages, a return to barbarism.

When the war ended and fascism was defeated, the Party and the working class once again demonstrated that they adhered to international solidarity and support for the peoples of all countries who were fighting to break free from inhumane colonialism. The Dutch imperialists sought to crush Indonesia's just struggle to break free from the shackles of imperialism. The Dutch colonialists sought to use Australia as a base against the Indonesian national revolution. We called for a boycott of the Dutch. Those outstanding fighters, sailors and dockworkers, once again stood at the forefront of the struggle.

In this memorable action, there were sometimes twelve or more sailors from different countries on strike in Australian ports, refusing to transport war materials for imperialism. Indonesian, Chinese and Indian sailors fought side by side with British and Australian sailors, as well as many sailors from Europe, including some Dutch sailors. This was a very memorable struggle and a very good manifestation of the international working-class solidarity. The struggle was victorious because the Dutch had to withdraw from Australia, and Indonesia finally regained its independence after three hundred years of imperialist rule.

Other memorable expressions of international solidarity by our country's working class include the pre-war struggle against the Menzies government's export of pig iron to Japan. Workers refused to load the "Dalfram" and were supported by British crew members. A large-scale movement was conducted around this issue. Our Party pointed out that the Japanese imperialists were part of the fascist axis threatening the world, and that Japanese militarists included Australia among their victims.

Undoubtedly, this exposure of the Menzies government's tolerant attitude towards fascism was one of the factors that prompted the Australian people to elect the Curtin government in place of the Menzies government to carry out the war effort.

Recently, while I was in Beijing, I visited the newly built Museum of Chinese Revolution History on Tiananmen Square. There were some articles selected from Chinese newspapers and other materials describing the Australian workers' boycott of Japan and their assistance to the Chinese people in the struggle they were already conducting against Japanese militarism. They were excited to meet people who had been in Kembla Port and participated in this struggle.

Some recent expressions of international solidarity are the support given to the Italian sailors and to the Indians last year, and this year to the British. This is proletarian international solidarity expressed in its highest form, that is, in action and common struggle.

Australian Communists and their supporters have consistently supported the great national revolutionary wars and struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America to break free from imperialist tyranny and plunder.

In the post-war years, our Party has consistently supported the working class in its struggle to improve living standards and the conditions of the working class. It has firmly supported the trade unions' struggle for a 40-hour working week for many years (a struggle that was finally won) and various struggles to raise wages. It has given its full support to the struggles of the Maritime Union, metalworkers and other workers.

As a reprisal, our Party's offices were frequently searched by federal police, as were the homes of Party members. Party documents and Marxist writings were confiscated. This offensive was particularly intense during the "state of emergency" declared by the Chifley government during the 1949 miners' strike.

While the leaders of the Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions opposed the miners, only the Communist Party loyally supported them. During these heroic struggles of the working class to improve their lives, many Communist trade union leaders, such as Healy, Roach, McPhillips, Williams, and several leaders of the Australian Labor Party, were imprisoned.

Our Party has always loyally supported the struggle of all trade union members, of all workers, against exploitation and for better treatment for our class.

When the Menzies government took over power from the Labor Party, it immediately stepped up its attacks on the Communist Party. This was an integral part of Menzies' slogan of the "Three-Year War". The Party waged an unrelenting struggle against the war preparations and imperialist plans led by the US ruling class for aggression against the socialist camp, which accounted for one-third of the world.

The Party steadfastly opposed the Korean War launched by US imperialism as a preparatory step for aggression against the newly established People's Republic of China.

The recent uprisings of the South Korean people and the exposure of the Rhee Syngman's brutal fascist regime imposed on the southern half of that country by US imperialism have shattered the propaganda that this was a war "for freedom" and against "Communist aggression". The exposure of the horrific atrocities committed by Rhee Syngman under the protection of the American occupation forces fully proves that the position taken by the Communist Party at that time was correct, namely, that this war was condemned as a colonialist war of aggression.

We fought for peace in Korea, helping the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers to defend democracy and independence, against expanding the war into Chinese territory. And the openly stated objective of General MacArthur and the militarists in North America was to expand this war into Chinese territory.

The Menzies government drafted a law banning the Communist Party. A broad movement against the so-called "Red Bill" was launched. The High Court ruled that, under the federal constitution, the federal government had no power to declare the Party illegal.

The Menzies government decided to hold a national referendum on September 22, 1951. The Labor movement, the Communist Party, and Australian Labor Party members, especially Dr. Evatt (then the Federal leader of the Australian Labor Party), launched a very outstanding movement, while the leaders of the industrial groups within the Australian Labor Party at the time tried to undermine this movement.

The democratic masses saw through the Menzies government, the monopoly capitalists and the press barons' tactics of propagating the horrors of communism. They rightly saw this as a threat to the democratic rights of the Australian people and voted against the anti-democratic proposals of the government of big business.

The failure of the "Communist Party Dissolution Act" and the victory achieved in the referendum on the conscription issue during the First World War emphatically demonstrate our people's loyalty to democracy and their attitude against tyranny and repressive measures. We have reason to be proud of the leading role our Party played in defeating this attack on fundamental democratic rights by the Menzies government and the firmness shown by our people in opposing repressive laws.

This was a remarkable and rare victory of democratic forces against the odds. There has never been such an example anywhere, that in a capitalist country, such a national vote defended civil liberties and the legal rights of the Communist Party, despite decades of slander, fearmongering and malicious distortion of the Communist Party's goals, both domestically and internationally, especially as this was happening during the "cold" war and the "hot" war in Korea.

Another major attack on the Communist Party, and also on the Labor Party, was the infamous Petrov Commission of 1954. At that time, the Menzies government used this traitor as a trump card to achieve victory in the forthcoming federal election. There is no need to elaborate on this incident, because it is still fresh in our minds - and still has a lingering stench. But praise must be given to all those who were bullied and slandered, and yet fought bravely to defeat this new attack on the entire labor movement.

Prior to this, a similar commission had been organized in Victoria over the statements of the Communist defector Sharpley, which also ended in a resounding defeat for the reactionaries.

In all these cases, the Communists stood in the forefront, fighting to defend the democratic rights won by the Australian people through struggle. This proves the slogan: "Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom".

Today, the main issues concerning the democratic front are the struggle against the Arbitration Act and the demand for the abolition of the "Penal Court". The Arbitration Act effectively denies workers' long-standing right to strike, and it also prevents trade unions from managing their own affairs through court-controlled voting and other means.

Another major issue is the question of the intelligence agency "Security Intelligence Organisation". It has again shown its power by seeking to ban the well-known anthropologist Professor Gluckman from staying in the New Guinea area.

The Security Intelligence Organisation now has the legal right to tap telephones, it interferes with the mail and conducts secret detective work on all working-class organizations without exception. This is a small secret police. There is no doubt that it is plotting new conspiracies to frame progressives. Further revisions to the criminal law, which will soon be made, will certainly not be directed against monopoly capitalists and reactionaries, but must be directed against the working-class movement.

All this requires us to be vigilant and launch a new broad movement to defend democracy, to fight for the right to strike, and against espionage activities such as preventing Professor Gluckman from staying in New Guinea.

In the years after the war, imperialism launched the "Cold War." For several years, the United States aggressors monopolized the atomic bomb, and they made frenzied preparations, militarily and ideologically, to use the atomic bomb against the Soviet Union and the socialist camp. However, Soviet science soon uncovered the secrets of the atomic bomb and detonated the hydrogen bomb before the United States, thereby ending the "monopoly" on these terrible weapons.

This ended Menzies' talk of "war in three years." And due to the Soviet Union's leading position in rocketry, this must certainly be a major factor in at least preventing the imperialist warmonger forces from plunging the world into an atomic war.

Our Party endorses the declaration drafted by the twelve Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries in Moscow in 1957, and it endorses the view expressed therein: that war is no longer inevitably inevitable; that today there are powerful forces, organized and militant forces in the struggle for peace, that can restrain and defeat the war-mongering forces of monopoly capital.

Our Party also fully agrees that as long as imperialism exists, there are still powerful forces and the danger of war remains. If this danger did not exist, there would be no point in waging the struggle for peace.

As part of the struggle for peace, the Party has condemned the continuous "small-scale" colonialist wars waged by imperialism in Malaya, Korea, Vietnam, Cyprus, Egypt, Algeria and Kenya during the period since the end of World War II. Today the Party supports the heroic struggles of Cuba and the Congo.

As part of the struggle for peace, the Party supports the demand that US imperialists get out of Taiwan (part of Chinese territory), Okinawa (Japanese territory) and other areas occupied by imperialists. It supports the struggle of the colonial peoples for national independence. It favors restoring the Chinese people's representation on all committees of the United Nations. This injustice greatly weakens the United Nations and discredits the United Nations in the eyes of all thinking people.

This blatant discrimination against the Chinese people is part of US imperialism's campaign to prepare for a war of aggression against the People's Republic of China. To defend world peace, this activity must be stopped.

Our Party supports the many peace initiatives put forward by the Soviet Union and the socialist countries. It has been at the forefront of the movement to demand that nuclear weapons be declared illegal and that existing nuclear weapons be destroyed, and in the movement to demand the phased disarmament proposed by the Soviet government, leading to complete disarmament.

The Party has participated in all domestic and international peace conferences. It is holding continuous movements and will continue to strengthen it to strive for peace.

Our Party believes that peace is the most important issue facing the world today. In our Party's forty years of life, the Party has been defending peace. It will continue to do so until war, like cannibalism and slavery, is forever eliminated from human society and becomes a vestige of a past barbaric era.

Our Party is full of confidence in the final victory of world socialism. Historically, no movement has advanced as rapidly as the international communist movement.

The first communist document in history, the "Communist Manifesto," was published by Marx and Engels in 1848. Engels later commented on this document, saying that "indeed, very few people were able to express their response." In 1957, the declaration of the twelve Communist and Workers' Parties drafted in Moscow emphasized that we live in "the era of transition from capitalism to socialism."

From the fact that there were seventy Communist Parties at the time this declaration was drafted, with a total of 33 million members, one can get an idea of the rapid development of communism. Recent figures show that in the three years since 1957, thirteen new Communist Parties have been established. There are now eighty-three Communist Parties, with membership increasing by three million, totaling 36 million. These are not just people holding party cards, but each is an active party member.

The total number of people living under the socialist system reaches one billion.

The Soviet Union will soon have the highest living standards and the shortest working week in the world. Within about ten years, the Soviet Union's average production per capita will exceed that of the United States. As eloquently demonstrated by spacecraft and artificial earth satellites, the Soviet Union is already leading in many scientific sectors. In many other respects, the Soviet Union also surpasses capitalism, such as no unemployed, no cyclical economic "recessions" and crises.

Other socialist countries are also advancing at high speed, surpassing capitalist countries. The output of socialist countries already accounts for one-third of world output, and by 1965, it will account for half of world output. This symbolizes the rapid development of communism in all aspects.

The Communist Party has led the greatest revolutions in history in Russia, China and various people's democratic countries. In capitalist countries such as France, Italy, India and Indonesia—to name only the major ones—the Communist Party has become a major party. At the same time, in all non-socialist countries, including our own, sound and growing communist parties are waging struggles.

What have the social democrats, revisionists, Trotskyists, etc., who oppose us, achieved? Social democratic parties have been in power in developed capitalist countries such as Britain, France, Germany, and the Scandinavian Peninsula, as well as in Australia, but there is no socialism in these countries.

In fact, they have not only abandoned socialism, but they do not even want nationalization under the capitalist system. They support imperialist military organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which aim to invade countries building socialism.

Revisionists and Trotskyists are incapable of building anything, and they are anti-Soviet and anti-communist, ranting madly behind the backs of the communist armies as they march towards victory.

The international working-class organizations, represented by trade unions, are also growing rapidly, both in number and in class consciousness, foreshadowing new victories for socialism.

Due to our Party's forty years of heroic struggle together with the masses, and because we are advancing with history, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of our Party's founding, we call on manual and intellectual workers to unite with us with confidence so that a socialist Australia may come soon.

    为争取和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的四十年
    ——纪念澳大利亚共产党成立四十周年
    澳大利亚共产党总书记　夏基
    澳大利亚共产党在成立以来的四十年中，一直站在保卫和平和民主的国际斗争的前列。
    澳大利亚共产党在反对帝国主义者在这一时期中进行的各种战争的斗争中，起了带头作用。今天这一崇高的斗争，在争取宣布核武器为非法、争取裁军和世界上社会主义部分和资本主义部分和平共处，反对殖民战争和反对侵略性的军国主义组织北大西洋公约组织和东南亚条约组织的阴谋的斗争中，达到了高潮。
    在澳大利亚共产党成立之前，就已经有由英勇的社会主义小组——共产党的先驱者——以及各工会和澳大利亚工党的优秀分子所树立的反对战争的传统。这种情况可以上溯到南非战争——非正义的帝国主义战争的赤裸裸的例子——和更早的殖民战争。
    在这以后，是第一次世界大战期间两次反征兵运动和1917年伟大的总罢工所取得的历史性胜利。造成反征兵运动和总罢工的原因，无疑是由于人们反对骇人的屠杀和不满旷日持久的战争使工人阶级的处境日益恶化。
    后来建立共产党的英勇的社会主义小组在上述具有历史意义的斗争中起了英勇的作用。
    作者就是在这些斗争中，开始关心政治，参加反对征兵的集会，散发反对征兵的传单和文件，并在他的故乡、斗争很激烈的奥兰基区支持1917年的罢工者。
    接着，发生了一切历史事件中最伟大的事件——列宁和布尔什维克党领导的俄国伟大的十月社会主义革命。
    苏俄当时受到以英、美、法、日等国为首的十四个帝国主义国家军队的进攻，这些国家还使用它们以前称之为“畜类”、“禽兽”的德国皇帝和兴登堡的军队。
    澳大利亚战士和社会主义者的反应，是成立“不准干涉俄国”委员会和进行保卫苏联和反对丘吉尔领导的干涉行动的强有力的运动。在领导方面占突出地位的是各共产主义小组。后来，这些小组在1920年10月30日正式成立了澳大利亚共产党。它继续进行这一斗争，直到这种干涉被光荣的工农红军击退为止。
    共产党人还强烈支持詹姆斯·康诺利的英勇起义和以建立爱尔兰共和国而告终的新芬党的反帝革命。
    我们的党是在斗争中诞生的，是在抗议帝国主义战争和帝国主义干涉中，在1917年大罢工运动中，保卫工人权利中，和在反对征兵的斗争中诞生的。（反对征兵的斗争，保卫了澳大利亚群众的基本民主自由，如果实施影响深远的征兵法案，澳大利亚群众的基本民主自由无疑将遭到严重的威胁。）
    当时另一个重要的民主胜利，是世界产业工人组织的十二个会员的胜利。为了对他们英勇的反战活动进行报复，他们被诬陷入罪，被判处最高达十五年的徒刑。
    在经过了长期的斗争和鼓动运动后，新南威尔士工党政府成立了一个皇家委员会，这个委员会在这十二个工人阶级战士服了五年徒刑后开释了他们。
    俄国工人阶级的英雄榜样和开始传到澳大利亚的列宁的著作和言论，使得澳大利亚工人阶级确信：澳大利亚工人阶级在争取和平，民主，争取提高生活水平，而最重要的是要取得社会主义在我国的胜利的斗争中，必须建立一个列宁主义式的党。
    我们党不仅用语言而且用行动来表现它的国际主义的观点和原则。因此我们党一开始就支持中国人民反对帝国主义的伟大群众运动，这一运动在大战结束和俄国革命胜利之后达到了高峰。帝国主义者，对他们说来是“很自然的”，力图用残暴的力量来粉碎觉醒中的中国人民。
    我们曾发动运动谴责沙面屠杀，在这次屠杀中，英帝国主义者向广州的和平示威开枪射击，杀死和杀伤要求帝国主义者滚出他们祖国的大批爱国者、工人、农民、学生以及其他的人。当“信奉基督教的”强盗们多次轰击不设防的中国城市，以便给“异教徒”以“教训”时，我们也发动了运动予以谴责。
    我们的党展开了一个保卫中国革命的运动，同时在一个广泛的统一战线的基础上成功地发展了“不干涉中国”委员会。这个委员会支持中国人民要从自己土地上铲除美、英、日等外国帝国主义者实际上是所有殖民主义狼群的长期斗争。这些狼群瓜分中国的领土，互相争吵，并贿赂中国的军阀们为它们打仗。
    我记得1930年在莫斯科见到一位中国同志，他说他很喜欢我代表不准干涉中国委员会发表的演说。我问他怎么会听到我的演说，他回答说：“在那个星期日，我在悉尼特区，参加了你发表演说的集会。”原来他当时是停在港口的一艘船上的海员。我代表委员会向他表示感谢，并保证我们继续支持中国人民争取祖国独立的正义事业。
    在1925年，党和具有战斗性的工人有机会表示他们的国际团结精神。这就是支持英国海员的大罢工。当时共产党在苏塞克斯街的会议厅以及在主要城市的党支部的办事处，都被用来安顿海员们，我们也为他们准备了床铺和食品。
    当时，党在自己的报刊上并通过各种群众集会，和澳大利亚海员们以及其他工会工作者，组织了强有力的宣传运动以保卫罢工的英国海员。
    这次罢工——不仅在这里，而且在世界各地的港口——持续了好几个星期，结果海员们取得了一定的胜利。
    1926年，反动的布鲁斯（现任上院议员）政府颁布了联邦刑事法案的政治和工业修正案，这些修正案的矛头是指向共产党和劳工运动的。当时的检察长累瑟姆爵士，所谓“保卫文化自由”委员会的成员，后来又“加强了”这些修正案。
    于是党就立即采取行动，发动了反对刑事法案、反劳工修正案的运动。后来，澳大利亚工会理事会坚决要求废除这个恶毒的立法中反对工人阶级的条款。联邦工党当时也答应废除这些修正案。从那时起，有过三届联邦工党政府——斯卡林、柯丁和齐佛莱——，但是这些“修正案”被原封不动地保留下来。
    事实上，我参加反对刑事法案的首次运动之后二十三年，我自己像其他一些人一样，在齐佛莱政府手中，成了这个法案的受害者。尽管在过去二十来年中，工党正式答应要把它废除。
    也是在党成立的初期，我们拥护建立一个全澳大利亚工会领导机构的建议。右翼分子反对这个建议。但是在劳工运动内经过长期斗争之后，终于成立了澳大利亚工会理事会。
    所有这一切，说明了我们党的真正性质——让敌人愿意怎么诬蔑我们就怎么诬蔑我们吧。说明我们党的原则态度是，反对反动的战争、帝国主义的殖民主义暴力、争取所有各国人民的民族独立、保卫澳大利亚的民主如在反对刑法的运动中所作的那样、加强我国的劳工运动、和一贯坚持以马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的学说为基础的国际主义。
    澳大利亚反动派的手法和别的地方一样，是在反共的旗帜下进攻人民的民主自由。
    一切反动力量，首先是垄断资本主义——如列宁所指出的，它总是竭力采取反动作法和暴力——及其助手，右翼分子，搞集团的分子，各派牧师中的大部分，叛徒和其他各色各样的败类，制造了“红色妖魔”的神话，并对共产党发动了进攻。但是隐藏在这后面的是向劳动人民的自由发动的全面进攻。不论在国内和国际上，他们都企图把这一点隐藏在谎言、诽谤和歪曲共产主义的谰言织成的毒雾的背后。
    从1926年的刑法到彼得罗夫委员会，情况都是这样。
    除了进行反对刑事法案修正案的斗争之外，党在早期发动的一个重要运动，是反对禁止海外印刷品的进口。这个运动持续了很长一个时期。反动派企图阻止澳大利亚工人阶级得悉苏联社会主义建设的成就和劳工运动在其他国家的进展。但是，这个反动禁令，这种思想统制，终于被击败了。
    随着法西斯主义的抬头，特别是由于以克虏伯为首的垄断资本家在德国建立希特勒独裁之后，就展开了为保卫和平与民主而斗争的新时期，这对于党和澳大利亚人民来说是有极其重大意义的。
    使工人警惕到走向新的世界大战的趋势和法西斯威胁的第一个大运动，是作为全面反战大会的代表基希于1934年年底到达澳大利亚时掀起的。当时的反动政府不准他上岸。这个反动政府的成员是所谓的“自由主义者”，他们挂的招牌是以工党叛徒莱昂斯为首的“统一澳大利亚党”。
    基希从船上跳上岸，因而腿受重伤。在法律程序进行期间，他“隐蔽”了一个时期。由于群众的压力、由于声势浩大的运动，他终于被准许同新西兰的一位代表格里芬一道留下来。那些记得广大群众热烈欢迎基希和格里芬的场面、记得他们在悉尼特区出现的情况以及基希发表的振奋人心的演说——基希自己身受纳粹的迫害，揭露和斥责在德国的恐怖统治以及法西斯分子、垄断资本家和军国主义者想尽办法挑起新的世界大战——的人们，将永远珍视这些回忆。
    基希强烈支持苏联政府的政策，这个政策要求非法西斯主义的国家建立集体安全制度以堵塞法西斯主义和战争的道路。
    基希的访问是值得记忆的事件。他的访问为共产党和所有热爱和平的人们为保卫和平、反对法西斯主义、争取维护和扩大民主展开长期的坚持不渝的运动开辟了道路。
    要是以美国和英国为首的帝国主义国家支持集体安全制度，本来极有可能避免第二次世界大战的爆发，并终于推翻法西斯主义的。可是这些国家拒绝集体安全制度，缔结了慕尼黑协定，听任希特勒攫取捷克斯洛伐克，鲸吞奥地利，干涉西班牙并在那里建立法西斯独裁，从而使战争成为不可避免。他们宁肯支持希特勒，希望他会把苏联搞垮。
    我们党一贯为维护和平与集体安全、为争取同苏联人民缔结联盟和支持西班牙民主主义者反对法西斯的英勇战斗而斗争。
    这是事实：工党的右翼领导人也拒绝支持反对柏林—罗马—东京轴心的集体安全制度，这种毫无远见的立场，有助于法西斯分子挑起战争。他们也是反共的受害者。
    党在从事反战宣传运动、揭露反动派和充当法西斯主义的帮凶的人们的时候，远不是没有受到打击的。反动派组织了一个法西斯团体“新警卫”，这个团体不惜使用武力，袭击党的集会，并在人数上占优势时殴打反法西斯主义者。作者被殴打，被投入小河中，全国各地有许多其他工人也受到残暴的殴击。
    工人保卫团组成了，并且多次使法西斯分子受到他们所没有意料到的打击。
    法西斯分子也开始攻击工党为支持兰格——当时是新南威尔士的总理——的政策而举行的示威。工人保卫团在这些场合帮助工党工人对付所谓的“新警卫”——希特勒和墨索里尼的模仿者。
    警察也不是静止不动的，在这个时期中，许多战斗分子被捕和监禁起来。
    党由于大力进行争取和平和反对法西斯主义的斗争而受到联邦政府的攻击。1932年，对“工人周报”发行人哈罗德迪万奈进行了诉讼。这个诉讼如果成功，本来会使共产党成为非法，由于再一次进行了广泛的群众运动，最后高等法院作出了不利于政府的判决。
    1935年，又采取了禁止共产党和“苏联之友社”的行动。但是在群众的压力下，这种行动放弃了。如果政府获得了成功，党和非党的和平战士的声音将遭到窒息。
    这一点和我们自己历史中的许多类似的例子，说明了备战活动同反共之间，备战活动同反动派对民主本身的相应的进攻之间的密切关系。这种密切关系也同样清楚地表现于“共产党解散法案”和“彼得罗夫委员会”之中。人们意识到这一点，并且拒绝这两者。
    在战争由于帝国主义者和法西斯分子的阴谋而开始的时候，同他们的希望相反，希特勒并没有“东进”而对西方进行攻击。
    在很长时期中，它被称为“假战争”。共产党在战争的初期，由于这场战争的帝国主义性质而反对它。这一次，孟席斯政府成功地对共产党实行了禁令，因为党不断地为争取和平和揭露国内外的法西斯主义和反动派而斗争。尽管有这个禁令，共产党还是能够进行它的活动。
    在这个时期中，两个共产党人——托乌斯和拉特里夫——由于散发告群众书而被拘禁。告群众书表明，拒绝同苏联缔结联盟的人要对希特勒的侵略负责。这个运动成功了，这两个战士最后获释。
    纳粹的目的是要统治世界。苏联是妨碍实现这个目的的主要障碍。希特勒下令对苏联进攻。苏联以打击对付打击。纳粹战争机器第一次被制止了。
    现在出现了反法西斯力量在世界范围的联合。这种联合是我们从1933年以来就争取的，并且是被西方帝国主义国家所破坏的。这个联合改变了战争的性质。
    苏联在反对法西斯主义的世界斗争中首当其冲。党发动了最充分地支持红军和苏联人民的运动。它特别为争取开辟第二战线，以便迅速结束战争而大力地进行了斗争。没有为苏联军队开辟第二战线，因为丘吉尔政府和美国希望使苏联精疲力尽，以便在获得和平时，它们能够强行规定它们自己的条件。
    当日本帝国主义发动进攻的时候，党号召工人用他们所有的一切力量来支持斗争，来击败日本帝国主义。
    当我们党为击败希特勒和日本军国主义法西斯分子而进行努力奋斗的时候，大约有四千名我党党员在军队中服役。同时，我们党给了苏联、中国人民解放军和所有其他同法西斯轴心作战的力量以全力的支持。因此，党尽到了它的职责。因为它认为，如果法西斯主义战胜民主联盟，就是回到黑暗时期，就是回到野蛮。
    在战争结束、法西斯主义被击败时，党和工人阶级再次证明，它们恪守对于为摆脱非人道的殖民主义而斗争的各国人民的国际团结和支持。荷兰帝国主义者力图粉碎印度尼西亚为摆脱帝国主义锁链而进行的正义斗争。荷兰殖民主义者力图利用澳大利亚作为反对印度尼西亚民族革命的一个基地。我们号召对荷兰进行抵制。那些卓越的战士，海员和码头工人，再一次站在斗争的最前列。
    在这个值得记忆的行动中，有时有十二个和十二个以上不同国家的海员在澳大利亚港口举行罢工，拒绝为帝国主义运输战争物资。印度尼西亚、中国和印度海员同英国、澳大利亚海员以及来自欧洲的许多海员，也包括一些荷兰海员，并肩战斗。这是一个很值得记忆的斗争和国际工人阶级团结的一个非常良好的表现。这个斗争获得了胜利，因为荷兰人不得不从澳大利亚撤退，而印度尼西亚在受到三百年的帝国主义统治以后终于重新获得它的独立。
    我国工人阶级其他的值得记忆的国际团结表现，包括战前反对孟席斯政府向日本出口生铁的斗争。工人们拒绝为“达尔弗拉姆号”装货，并且受到英国船员的支持。围绕这个问题进行了大规模运动。我们党指出，日本帝国主义者是威胁世界的法西斯轴心的一部分，日本军国主义者把澳大利亚列在他们的受害者之列。
    毫无疑问，对孟席斯政府对法西斯主义采取的宽容态度的这种揭露，是促使澳大利亚人民选举柯丁政府代替孟席斯政府来进行战争努力的因素之一。
    最近我在北京的时候，我参观了在天安门广场的新建的中国革命历史博物馆。有一些选自中国报纸的文章和其它材料，叙述澳大利亚工人对日本的抵制以及他们在中国人民已经对日本军国主义进行的斗争中给予中国人民的援助。他们对于遇见曾在开姆布拉港并且参与这一斗争的人感到兴奋。
    国际团结的最近一些表现，是去年对于意大利海员和对于印度人的支持以及今年对于英国人所表示的支持。这是以最高形式，即在行动中和共同斗争中表示的无产阶级国际团结。
    澳大利亚共产党人和他们的支持者一贯支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民争取摆脱帝国主义暴政和掠夺的伟大的民族革命战争和斗争。
    在战后年代里，我们的党一贯支持工人阶级争取改善生活水平和工人阶级的处境的斗争。它许多年来一直坚决支持工会进行的争取每周工作四十小时的斗争（这个斗争最后获得了胜利）和争取提高工资的各种斗争。它全力支持海运工会、五金工人和其他工人进行的斗争。
    作为一种报复，我们党的办事处经常受到联邦警察的搜查，党员的家里也同样受到搜查。党的文件和马克思主义著作被没收。齐弗莱政府在1949年矿工罢工时宣布的“紧急状态”期间，这种进攻特别厉害。
    在工党和澳大利亚工会理事会的领袖们反对矿工的时候，只有共产党忠实地支持他们。在工人阶级争取改善生活的这些英勇斗争期间，共产党的许多工会负责人，如希里、罗奇、麦克菲利普、威廉斯和澳大利亚工党的若干负责人都被关到监狱里去。
    我们的党始终忠实地支持反对剥削和为我们的阶级争取较好待遇的一切工会会员、一切工人的斗争。
    当孟席斯政府从工党手中接管了政权的时候，它立即加紧攻击共产党。这是孟席斯的“三年战争”的口号的一个组成部分。党进行着不屈不挠的斗争，来反对美国统治阶级所领导的、为了侵略占世界三分之一的社会主义阵营而进行的战争准备和帝国主义计划。
    党坚定不移地反对美帝国主义作为侵略新建立的中华人民共和国的准备步骤而发动的朝鲜战争。
    南朝鲜人民最近的暴动和对美帝国主义强加于这个国家南半部的李承晚残暴法西斯政权的揭露，粉碎了说什么这是“争取自由”和反对“共产党侵略”的战争的造谣宣传。对于李承晚在美国占领军庇护下的骇人听闻的暴行的揭露，充分地证明了共产党在当时所采取的立场是正确的，那就是谴责这种战争是殖民主义侵略战争。
    我们进行了斗争，争取朝鲜的和平，帮助朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军来保卫民主和独立，反对把这个战争扩大到中国国土上去。而麦克阿瑟将军和北美的军国主义者所公开宣布的目的就是要把这个战争扩大到中国国土上去。
    孟席斯政府起草了关于禁止共产党的法律。一个反对所谓“赤色法案”的广泛运动开展了。高等法院裁决：根据联邦宪法，联邦政府无权宣布党为非法。
    孟席斯政府决定在1951年9月22日举行全国公民投票。劳工运动、共产党和澳大利亚工党党员、特别是伊瓦特博士（当时是澳大利亚工党的联邦领袖）展开了非常出色的运动，而当时澳大利亚工党内部的工业集团的领袖却竭力来破坏这个运动。
    民主的群众看透了孟席斯政府、垄断资本家和报纸大王宣传共产党可怕的伎俩。他们正确地认为这是对澳大利亚人民民主权利的威胁，投票反对大企业的政府的反民主的建议。
    “共产党解散法案”的失败和第一次世界大战期间征兵问题公民投票所取得的胜利，着重地表明了我们的人民对民主的忠诚、反对暴政和镇压措施的态度。我们有理由感到骄傲的是，我们的党在击败孟席斯政府对基本民主权利的这次进攻中所起的领导作用和我们的人民在反对镇压性法律方面所表现出来的坚定态度。
    这是民主力量以寡胜众而取得的一次卓越的和罕有的胜利。在任何地方都没有过这样的例子，那就是在一个资本主义国家中，这样的全国投票保卫了公民自由和共产党的合法权利，尽管数十年来在国内和国际上对共产党的目的进行诬蔑、制造恐怖和恶意的歪曲，特别是由于这件事正发生在“冷”战和朝鲜的“热”战期间。
    对共产党，也是对工党的另一次大规模的进攻，是1954年的声名狼借的彼得罗夫委员会。当时孟席斯政府曾利用这个叛徒作为在未来的联邦选举中取得胜利的一件法宝。对于这次事件是没有必要详细说明的，因为在我们的脑海里，这件事记忆犹新——而且仍有余臭。但是必须赞扬所有那些人，他们受到欺凌和诬蔑，而却英勇地进行斗争，击败了对整个劳工运动的这种新的进攻。
    在这以前，曾经就共产党叛徒夏普利的声明而在维多利亚组织了一个类似的委员会，它也以反动派的惨败而告终。
    在所有这些情况下，共产党员都站在最前列，为保卫澳大利亚人民通过斗争而赢得的民主权利而斗争。这证明了这个口号：“永远保持警惕是自由的代价”。
    今天，关于民主阵线的主要问题是反对仲裁法和要求废除“刑罚法庭”的斗争。仲裁法实际上否认工人的久已存在的罢工权利，而且它还通过法庭控制的投票等手段不让工会管理工人自己的事务。
    另一个主要问题是关于特务机关“安全局”的问题。它设法禁止著名人类学家格拉克曼教授呆在新几内亚地区，从而再次显示了它的权力。
    安全局现在有偷听电话的合法权利，它干扰邮件和毫无例外地对一切工人阶级的组织进行秘密侦探。这是一个小型的秘密警察。毫无疑问，它在策划诬陷进步人士的新阴谋。不久将进行的对刑法的进一步修改，肯定不是对付垄断资本家和反动派，而一定是对付工人阶级运动的。
    所有这一切，要求我们警惕，发动保卫民主的新的广泛运动，争取罢工权利，反对不让格拉克曼教授呆在新几内亚之类的特务活动。
    在战后几年里，帝国主义发动了“冷战”。几年来，美国侵略势力垄断了原子弹，它们在军事上和思想上作了狂热的准备想对苏联和社会主义阵营使用原子弹。可是，苏联的科学很快揭开了原子弹的秘密，并且先于美国爆炸了氢弹，从而结束了对这些可怕的武器的“垄断”。
    这种情况就结束了孟席斯所谓“三年后发生战争”的说法。还由于苏联在火箭方面的领先地位，这肯定至少成为阻止帝国主义战争贩子势力把世界投入原子战争的一个主要因素。
    我们党赞同社会主义国家十二个共产党和工人党1957年在莫斯科起草的宣言，它赞同其中表示的这一观点：战争不再是注定不可避免的；今天存在着强大的力量，这种在争取和平的斗争中有组织的、富有战斗性的力量可以抑制和击败垄断资本的战争贩子的势力。
    我们党还完全同意，只要帝国主义还存在，还有强大的力量，战争危险就依然存在。如果这种危险不存在的话，那么进行争取和平的斗争就没有意义。
    作为争取和平斗争的一部分，党谴责帝国主义在第二次世界大战结束以来这段时期内连续不断地在马来亚、朝鲜、越南、塞浦路斯、埃及、阿尔及利亚和怯尼亚发动的“小规模”殖民主义战争。党今天支持古巴和刚果的英勇斗争。
    作为争取和平斗争的一部分，党支持这样的要求：美帝国主义者滚出台湾（中国领土的一部分），冲绳（日本的领土）和帝国主义者霸占的其它地区。它支持殖民地人民争取民族独立的斗争。它赞成恢复中国人民在联合国各委员会中的代表权。这种不公正的现象大大地使联合国软弱无能，并使联合国在一切有思想的人的眼中变得信誉扫地。
    这种对中国人民的明目张胆的歧视，是美帝国主义准备对中华人民共和国发动侵略战争的活动的一部分。为了保卫世界和平，这种活动必须制止。
    我们党支持苏联和社会主义国家所提出的许多和平创议。在要求宣布核武器为非法和销毁现存核武器的运动中，在要求实行苏联政府所建议的分阶段裁军、直到全面裁军的运动中，它一直站在最前列。
    党参加了国内和国际的所有的和平大会。它举行不停顿的运动，并将继续加强它来争取和平。
    我们党认为和平是全世界今天所面临的最重大的问题。在我党四十年的生活中，党一直在保卫和平。它将继续这样做，直到战争像吃人蛮俗和奴隶制度一样，从人类社会中永远消除掉而成为过去野蛮时代的陈迹为止。
    我们党对于世界社会主义的最后胜利充满了信心。历史上从没有任何运动像国际共产主义运动前进得这样迅速。
    历史上第一个共产主义文件“共产党宣言”是由马克思和恩格斯在1848年发表的。恩格斯后来在评论这个文件的时候说，“能够表示响应的人，的确是极少的。”1957年，在莫斯科起草的十二国共产党和工人党的宣言强调说，我们生活在“从资本主义向社会主义过渡的时代”中。
    在起草这个宣言的时候，有七十个共产党，共有党员三千三百万人，从这一事实中，可以对共产主义的迅速发展，得到一个概念。最近的数字表明，在1957年以来的三年内，有十三个新的共产党成立。现在有八十三个共产党，党员人数增加了三百万，总共达到三千六百万。这些不只是持有党证的人，而每一个都是积极的党员。
    生活在社会主义制度下的人民的总数达十亿。
    苏联不久将具有世界上最高的生活水平和最短的工作周。在十年左右之内，苏联按人口计算的平均生产量将超过美国。像宇宙飞船和人造地球卫星所雄辩地证明的那样，苏联已经在许多科学部门领先。在其他许多方面，苏联也超过了资本主义，例如没有失业者，没有周期性的经济“衰退”和危机。
    其他的社会主义国家也在以高速度前进，超过资本主义国家。社会主义国家的生产量已占世界生产量的三分之一，到1965年，将占世界总生产量的一半。这就象征着共产主义在一切方面的迅速发展。
    共产党在俄国、中国和各个人民民主国家领导了历史上最伟大的革命。在法国、意大利、印度和印度尼西亚——姑且只谈主要的——等资本主义国家中，共产党已成为大党。同时，在所有的非社会主义国家中，包括我们自己国家在内，健全和日益壮大的共产党正在进行斗争。
    同我们作对的社会民主党人、修正主义者和托洛茨基分子等等，他们搞出了什么名堂呢？社会民主派的政党在英国、法国、德国和斯堪的纳维亚半岛等发达的资本主义国家以及在澳大利亚都执过政，可是在这些国家中没有社会主义。
    事实上，他们不仅背弃社会主义，而且连资本主义制度下的国有化也不要了。他们支持旨在侵略建设社会主义的国家的北大西洋公约组织和东南亚条约组织等的帝国主义军事组织。
    修正主义者和托洛茨基分子没有能力建树什么，他们反苏反共，在共产主义大军走向胜利的时候在他们背后疯狂叫嚷。
    以工会为代表的国际工人阶级组织，不论在数量和阶级觉悟上，也都在迅速壮大，预示着社会主义未来的新胜利。
    由于我们党同群众一道进行了四十年的英勇斗争，由于我们随着历史前进，我们在我们建党四十周年的时候，满怀信心地呼吁体力劳动者和脑力劳动者同我们联合起来，以使社会主义的澳大利亚早日来临。
