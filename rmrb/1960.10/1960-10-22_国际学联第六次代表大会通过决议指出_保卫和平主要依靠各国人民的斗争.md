Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 19th: The Sixth Congress of the International Union of Students (IUS), after twelve days of meetings, closed here tonight.

The speeches of representatives from the vast majority of countries at the congress, as well as the resolutions passed, reflected the strong desire of students around the world to defend world peace, oppose imperialism and colonialism, strive for national independence, and fight for the democratization of education. The resolution on peace, unanimously adopted at the congress, emphasized that defending peace mainly relies on the struggle of people of all countries.

The resolution stated, "Today, the forces for peace are stronger than ever before. The forces striving for peace have united an even broader range of people with different political views and ideologies year by year. The achievements of the national liberation movements against colonialism and imperialism in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are a major contribution to the struggle to defend peace. An increasing number of peace-loving countries are taking an active stand in the struggle to ease international tensions and oppose preparations for a new world war. This strengthens the determination of students to make greater efforts to defend peace and ensure a happier future for mankind than the present."

The resolution continued, "At the same time, the Congress calls on all students to be aware that the danger of war continues to exist, and that the most serious and direct danger to peace is the existence of imperialism and colonialism – the root cause of oppression and exploitation wars that constitute a permanent threat to international security."

The resolution stated, "The Ten-Nation Disarmament Negotiations have failed to find a positive solution to the disarmament problem, French colonialists are violating the national sovereignty of Algeria, continuing the war in Algeria, and conducting atomic tests in the Sahara, Belgium and NATO member states are aggressing against the Republic of the Congo, the United States threatens to invade Cuba, the United States and Japan have concluded a military treaty, West German militarism is being revived and the Federal Republic of Germany is being rearmed, the continued aggression against Oman and southern Arabia, and the tensions that exist in other parts of the Middle East, the plan to conclude new military regional treaties that endanger the peace and security of this strategically important region of the world, and the continued existence of fascist dictatorships in Spain and Portugal, all of which show that the imperialists, headed by US imperialism, are trying to create tension in the world, thereby posing a new danger of war." The Congress reminded students that maintaining peace means waging a persistent struggle, a struggle that requires all peace-loving forces to remain vigilant and united forever.

The resolution expressed support for the struggle of students in various countries against imperialist aggression, support for the struggle of Chinese students to liberate Taiwan from the occupation of US imperialism, and demanded the restoration of the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

The Congress decided to further strengthen the efforts of students to strive for world peace, and called on student organizations to actively participate in the worldwide movement for peace.

The resolution on imperialism and colonialism, unanimously adopted at the congress, pointed out that in the past two years, the struggle of students of various countries, together with the people of their own countries, against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence and peace, has seen a tremendous upsurge. This struggle, which unites a wide range of students from Asian, African, and Latin American countries, is certainly one of the main features of the international student movement; in this struggle against imperialism and colonialism, students are making their most important contribution to the struggle to re-establish and maintain true peace. Since the last congress was held in Beijing, a number of countries have gained independence, which is a positive result of the struggle of people of all countries against imperialism and colonialism.

The resolution then reviewed the struggles of students in various countries. The resolution pointed out that in Africa, the national democratic liberation movement is continuing to develop. Students and people of African countries are resolutely engaged in the struggle to win true national independence or to consolidate the independence that has already been achieved.

In Asia, the struggles of students and people in Japan, South Korea, and Turkey overthrew the governments of Nobusuke Kishi, Syngman Rhee, and Menderes, and students in these countries are still fighting against US imperialism and its running dogs. All this is a brilliant victory for democratic forces against US imperialism.

When talking about the struggle of Latin American students, the resolution said that the congress is very satisfied to see the heroic work of Latin American students, which is not limited to activities in universities and organizations, but mainly to carry out common struggles with the people of their own countries to eliminate the phenomenon of man exploiting man, poverty and ignorance. These principles are the permanent goals of Latin American students, which are manifested in their long tradition of anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggles and are stipulated by the Latin American Student Congress.

The resolution emphasized that in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism, students have learned that they must unite and must closely support each other; and they realize that their own vital interests are inseparable from the struggle of the people of their own countries against imperialism and colonialism. Through the anti-imperialist struggle, students specifically realize that unity is strength.

The resolution stated that in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, a bright future is opening up before the students: the imperialist world system is increasingly declining and suffering serious setbacks every day; and students in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, thanks to their resolute struggle and the support they receive from peace-loving people, are constantly gaining victories in their struggle for national independence and the development of national culture. The resolution stated that the Congress fully supports the struggle of students in Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism.

The resolution finally called on students from all over the world to work together with the people of their own countries to wage a large-scale and resolute struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The resolution said that, in the final analysis, complete victory depends on the struggle of the people of all countries.

The Congress also unanimously adopted another series of resolutions. In resolutions on specific issues, the Congress condemned imperialism, headed by the United States, for its aggression against Cuba, the Congo, Korea, Algeria, and other countries, as well as the war policies of imperialism. These resolutions expressed the mutual support and solidarity of students around the world in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, for national independence, and to defend world peace.

These resolutions also included resolutions on the democratization of education, on the unity and cooperation of world students, on student cultural work, and on holding the Eighth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship.

The Congress elected a new Executive Committee comprising twenty-nine members, twenty-one of whom were representatives from Asian, African, and Latin American countries. The representative of Czechoslovakia was elected Chairman of the Executive Committee, and the representatives of the Soviet Union, Cuba, Japan, Sudan, Venezuela, and Black Africa were elected Vice-Chairmen. The Secretary-General was the representative of Iraq. The secretaries of the Secretariat were the representatives of China, India, Bulgaria, Poland, Ecuador, and Puerto Rico.

The conference closed in the singing of the International Student Union anthem and with prolonged applause.

    国际学联第六次代表大会通过决议指出
    保卫和平主要依靠各国人民的斗争
    国际局势表明：以美国为首的帝国主义正在世界上制造紧张，从而构成新的战争危险。一切爱好和平的力量应永远保持警惕和团结，并进行坚持不渝的斗争。学生的切身利益同本国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争分不开。通过斗争，学生认识到团结就是力量。
    据新华社巴格达19日电　国际学生联合会第六次代表大会经过十二天会议以后，今晚在这里闭幕。
    绝大多数国家的代表在大会的发言以及代表大会上通过的决议，反映了世界学生为保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取民族独立和争取教育民主化而斗争的强烈愿望。代表大会上一致通过的关于和平的决议强调说，保卫和平主要依靠各国人民的斗争。
    决议说，“今天，和平力量比过去任何时候都更为强大。争取和平的力量一年年地团结了更广泛的具有不同政治观点和意识形态的人。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国反对殖民主义和帝国主义的民族解放运动所获得的成就，是对保卫和平的斗争的重大贡献。数目越来越多的爱好和平的国家，在争取缓和国际紧张局势和反对准备新的世界大战的斗争中采取了积极的立场。这加强了学生们为保卫和平和保证人类有比现在幸福的未来作出更大的努力的决心。”
    决议继续说，“同时，代表大会要求所有学生注意战争的危险继续存在，对和平最严重和最直接的危险是帝国主义和殖民主义——构成对国际安全永久威胁的压迫和剥削战争的根源——的存在。”
    决议说，“十国裁军谈判未能找出解决裁军问题的积极办法，法国殖民主义者侵犯阿尔及利亚国家主权、在阿尔及利亚继续进行战争并在撒哈拉进行原子试验，比利时和北大西洋公约组织成员国对刚果共和国的侵略，美国侵略古巴的威胁，美国和日本缔结军事条约，西德军国主义的复活和德意志联邦共和国的重新武装，继续对阿曼和阿拉伯南部的侵略以及中东其他地方存在的紧张，缔结使世界上这个具有战略意义的地区的和平与安全受到危害的新的军事地区条约的计划，西班牙和葡萄牙继续存在法西斯独裁政权，所有这一切均表明，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者正在设法在世界上制造紧张，从而构成新的战争危险。”代表大会提醒学生们注意，维护和平意味着进行坚持不渝的斗争，这种斗争要求一切爱好和平的力量永远保持警惕和团结。
    决议表示支持各国学生反对帝国主义侵略的斗争，支持中国学生把台湾从美帝国主义占领下解放出来的斗争，并要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国组织的合法席位。
    代表大会决定进一步加强学生争取世界和平的努力，并号召学生的组织积极参加全世界争取和平的运动。
    代表大会上一致通过的关于帝国主义和殖民主义的决议指出，在过去的两年中，各国学生同他们本国人民一道进行的反对帝国主义和殖民主义，争取民族独立和和平的斗争，有了巨大的高涨。这个团结了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国广大学生的斗争，肯定是国际学生运动的主要特征之一；在这个反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中，学生正在对争取重新确立和保持真正和平的斗争，作出他们最重要的贡献。自从上次代表大会在北京举行以来，好些国家已经获得独立，这是各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的积极成果。
    决议接着回顾了各国学生的斗争。决议指出，在非洲，民族民主解放运动正在继续发展。非洲各国学生和人民正在坚决从事争取真正的民族独立或巩固已经获得的独立的斗争。
    在亚洲，日本、南朝鲜、土耳其学生和人民的斗争，推翻了岸信介、李承晚和曼德列斯的政府，这些国家的学生仍在进行反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。所有这一切，都是民主力量反对美帝国主义的光辉胜利。
    决议在谈到拉丁美洲学生的斗争时说，大会非常满意地看到拉丁美洲学生进行的英勇工作，这种工作并不局限于大学和组织方面的活动，而主要是同本国人民一道进行共同的斗争来消除人剥削人、贫困和愚昧的现象。这些原则是拉丁美洲学生的永久的目标，这表现于他们反帝国主义和反殖民主义斗争的悠久传统中，并为拉丁美洲学生大会所规定。
    决议强调指出，学生在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同斗争中，已经了解到必须团结，必须相互密切支援；并且认识到，他们的切身利益，同他们本国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争是分不开的。通过反帝斗争，学生具体地认识到，团结就是力量。
    决议说，在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中，学生的面前打开了光明的前景：帝国主义世界体系正在日益衰亡，每天遭到严重的挫折；而亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和欧洲学生，由于他们的坚决斗争和他们从爱好和平的人民那里得到的支持，在争取民族独立和发展民族文化方面，正在不断地获得胜利。决议说，代表大会全力支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲学生反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争。
    决议最后呼吁世界各国的学生同本国人民协力，进行反对帝国主义和殖民主义的大规模的坚决斗争。决议说，归根到底，彻底的胜利取决于各国人民的斗争。
    代表大会上还一致通过了另外一系列的决议。在有关各项具体问题决议中，代表大会谴责以美国为首的帝国主义对古巴、刚果、朝鲜、阿尔及利亚和其他国家的侵略以及帝国主义的战争政策。这些决议表示全世界学生在反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取民族独立和保卫世界和平的斗争中互相支持和声援。
    这些决议中还包括关于教育民主化、关于世界学生的团结和合作、关于学生文化工作以及关于举行第八届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的决议。
    代表大会选出了包括二十九个委员的新的执行委员会，其中二十一个委员是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的代表。捷克斯洛伐克代表当选为执行委员会主席，苏联、古巴、日本、苏丹、委内瑞拉和黑非洲代表为副主席。总书记为伊拉克代表。书记处书记为中国、印度、保加利亚、波兰、厄瓜多尔和波多黎各代表。
    大会在国际学生联合会的会歌声中和经久不息的掌声中闭幕。
