Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 25th: A report from Panmunjom: On the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers’ participation in the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the Korean Military Armistice Commission held its 129th meeting today at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side. At the meeting, Zhu Changjun, the chief member of the Korean-Chinese side, sternly condemned the US side's evil acts of expanding armaments and preparing for war and obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, demanded the immediate withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, and lodged a strong protest against the US side's recent conspiracy to plan a new war.

At the meeting, Zhu Changjun pointed out that the withdrawal of American troops and all foreign troops from South Korea is a prerequisite for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Therefore, the Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates that all foreign troops must withdraw from Korea. However, the US side has perfidiously violated the armistice agreement it signed, using bayonets to maintain the colonial system imposed on South Korea, plotting to permanently divide Korea, and at the same time, frantically preparing to launch a new war of aggression against the Korean people.

Zhu Changjun then listed the facts that the US side stubbornly refused a series of peaceful initiatives proposed by the Korean-Chinese side for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the relaxation of tensions in Korea, and condemned the US side's actions to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea.

Zhu Changjun emphasized that the Chinese People's Volunteers have voluntarily and completely withdrawn from Korea for two years now. However, the US side not only does not end its occupation of South Korea, but further increases the number of US troops stationed in South Korea, and even continues to transport various new weapons such as atomic weapons and missiles, openly advocating war. The Korean-Chinese side has lodged dozens of strong protests against the US side's arms expansion and war preparation activities and repeatedly demanded that the US side immediately transport all illegally imported military weapons out of Korea. However, the US side ignored the protests and demands of the Korean-Chinese side and instead intensified its war preparations. In early October of this year, the US side transported "F86-D" military fighter jets into South Korea, and recently clamored to transport T-28 high-performance jet trainers. On October 18, the US side carried out provocative acts, openly launching atomic cannon "Honest John" rockets and newly transported anti-tank missiles near the demilitarized zone.

Zhu Changjun lodged the strongest protest against the US side's conspiracy to plan a new war.

Zhu Changjun said that due to the US imperialism's frenzied implementation of a military colonial policy in South Korea, the Korean territory has been divided into two parts, and the Korean nation is in a state of division. Today's South Korea has been reduced to a killing field, where unprecedented bloody suppression and slaughter are being carried out everywhere, and there is a scene of poverty and hunger everywhere. South Korea has become an atomic war forward base and war base against the Korean people and the people of the Far East. All of this shows that only the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea can realize the peaceful reunification of Korea, maintain and consolidate peace and security in Korea, and rescue the people of South Korea from misfortune and suffering.

At today's meeting, the US side once again used the excuse that the withdrawal of troops is a "political issue" and that the Military Armistice Commission has no right to discuss it to unreasonably reject the demands of the Korean-Chinese side.

    朝鲜军事停战委员会举行会议
    朝中方面要求美军立即撤出朝鲜南部
    严厉谴责美方扩军备战和阻碍朝鲜统一的罪行
    新华社平壤25日电　板门店消息：在中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战十周年之际，根据朝中方面建议，朝鲜军事停战委员会今天举行第一百二十九次会议。朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将在会上严厉谴责美方扩军备战和阻碍朝鲜和平统一的罪恶行为，要求美军立即撤出朝鲜南部，并对美方最近策划新战争的阴谋活动提出强硬抗议。
    朱昌骏少将在会上指出，从朝鲜南部撤出美国军队等一切外国军队是和平解决朝鲜问题的先决条件，因此，朝鲜停战协定规定，一切外国军队必须从朝鲜撤出。但是，美方却背信弃义地破坏自己签字的停战协定，用刺刀来维持强加于朝鲜南部的殖民制度，策划永远分裂朝鲜，同时还疯狂地准备对朝鲜人民发动新的侵略战争。
    朱昌骏少将接着列举美方固执地拒绝朝中方面为和平解决朝鲜问题及缓和朝鲜的紧张局势而提出的一系列和平倡议的事实，谴责了美方阻挠朝鲜和平统一的行为。
    朱昌骏少将着重指出，中国人民志愿军主动地全部撤出朝鲜已经有两年了。但是，美方不但不结束对朝鲜南部的占领，反而进一步增加强占朝鲜南部的美军兵力，同时还甚至继续运入发射原子武器和导弹等各种新式武器，公然鼓吹战争。对美方这种扩军备战活动，朝中方面曾经提出过数十次强硬抗议并一再要求美方立即把非法运入的一切军事武器运出朝鲜。但美方不顾朝中方面的抗议和要求，反而变本加厉地进行备战活动。今年10月初，美方把“F86—D”型军事战斗机运入朝鲜南部，最近又叫嚣要运入T—28高效能喷气式训练机，10月18日美方进行挑衅行为，公然在非军事区附近发射原子大炮“诚实的约翰”火箭和新近运入的反坦克导弹。
    朱昌骏少将对美方的这种策划新战争的阴谋活动提出最强硬的抗议。
    朱昌骏少将说，由于美帝国主义疯狂地在朝鲜南部推行军事殖民政策，朝鲜国土被分割成两部分，朝鲜民族处于分裂状态，今天的朝鲜南部已经沦为杀人的屠场，到处都在进行史无前例的血腥镇压和屠杀，到处是一片贫穷和饥饿的景象。朝鲜南部已成了反对朝鲜人民和远东人民的原子战争前哨基地和战争策源地，这一切表明，只有从朝鲜南部撤出美军才能实现朝鲜的和平统一，维护和巩固朝鲜的和平和安全，把朝鲜南部人民从不幸和痛苦中解救出来。
    在今天的会议上，美方又以撤军是“政治问题”；军事停战委员会无权讨论为借口，无理拒绝朝中方面的要求。
