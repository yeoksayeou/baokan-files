Revolutionary Memoirs

    The Qinghuabian Ambush
    Zhang Peiran
    In March 1947, the sound of cannons echoed across the loess plateau of northern Shaanxi, and the clear sky rolled with gunpowder smoke like dark clouds. Chiang Kai-shek concentrated more than 200,000 troops to launch an attack on our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and the flames of civil war were burning in Yan'an. Yan'an, the focus of millions of peace-loving people, the revolutionary holy land of the Chinese people, suffered the ravages of war.
    During these days and nights of battle, our teaching brigade fought the enemy in the Nanshan area of Yan'an, covering the transfer of the Party Central Committee and Yan'an agencies to the rear. On the evening of March 18th, we had just repelled the enemy's last attack of the day. I was discussing the night's combat with instructor Qiu Deshan when Regiment Commander Luo Shaowei called, ordering my battalion to transfer to the Qinghuabian area overnight to prepare for new combat missions. Upon hearing the transfer, I couldn't help but exclaim "Ah!" Regiment Commander probably heard my voice and immediately continued, "Comrade, stay calm, the transfer is to strive for greater victory! We fought well this time, wiping out more than 5,000 enemies. More importantly, we resisted for seven days and nights, buying time and ensuring the safe transfer of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. This shattered the enemy's conspiracy to suddenly attack Yan'an, which is the greatest victory. You must tell the soldiers the significance of this victory." Then, he ordered me to temporarily act as the commander of the Third Battalion and lead the troops to complete this transfer mission.
    That night, we withdrew from the southeast Chuanli area of Yan'an. After marching for most of the night, we arrived at Baijiageda Village, east of Qinghuabian, at dawn. As soon as the troops arrived, they sealed off the news and assembled covertly.
    On the 21st, the cadres of our battalion went to the regimental headquarters for a meeting. As soon as the regiment commander saw us, he said excitedly, "Comrades, you must be itching for action, right? Now the mission is here, we are going to fight soon!" Hearing this, the cadres of each battalion were all radiant and asked in unison, "Really! What mission?"
    The regiment commander pointed to the map on the wall with his red and blue pencil and said, "After the Hu Zongnan bandit army occupied Yan'an, as we expected, they were very arrogant. The enemy sent its main force to find our army for a decisive battle, and also sent troops to protect the supply line. Since the enemy is determined to fight a decisive battle, we will cater to them. The day before yesterday, our Independent First Brigade sent a small force to retreat towards the northwest of Yan'an, luring the enemy's main force to the north to Anse. Our main force will find an opportunity to ambush in Qinghuabian. According to recent reconnaissance, after the enemy's 31st Brigade entered Guaimao Village, they inquired about the route to Qinghuabian from the masses and busied themselves preparing dry rations. It seems that the enemy wants to continue northward and occupy Qinghuabian, this important transportation hub. Therefore, our main force must gather south of Qinghuabian, set up a pocket, and wipe out the 31st Brigade."
    As soon as the regiment commander finished speaking, everyone asked, "Regiment Commander! Give us the main attack mission. The soldiers have been holding back a lot of energy and want to fight a good battle to vent their hatred."
    At this time, Political Commissar Wei Zhiming said, "Comrades, this is our first battle after withdrawing from Yan'an, we must fight it well and severely dampen the enemy's arrogance. Go back and tell the soldiers well, let everyone sharpen their bayonets brightly and give the enemy a taste of their power."
    As soon as the meeting ended, Regiment Commander Luo took the battalion-level cadres to reconnoiter the terrain, and then divided the area for each battalion and specifically explained the combat mission.
    Qinghuabian is in the northeast direction of Yan'an, and its south side is a thirty-mile long Chuan valley. Both sides of the Chuan valley are bare mountains. The highway from Xianyang via Yan'an to Yulin passes through this Chuan. This is truly a good terrain for an ambush. As long as the enemy enters, we attack from both sides, and not one of them will be able to escape.
    Before dawn on the 24th, the troops covertly entered the position. The First Column was ambushed in the West Mountain, and the Second Column and our Teaching Brigade were ambushed in the East Mountain. The two main forces were like a pair of iron pincers with open mouths, extending the pincer mouth to the south. After the enemy's rear troops passed, the troops ambushed in the south would launch a fierce attack from the east and west sides, cutting off the enemy's retreat and sealing the pincer mouth, and then attack north along the highway. The New Fourth Brigade would occupy the northeast high ground of Qinghuabian to block the enemy from the front. The troops lay in ambush for a whole day, but never waited for the enemy. The commanders observed with binoculars and did not even find a shadow of the enemy. Everyone secretly guessed: Could it be that our plan of action was seen through by the enemy? In the evening, the regiment commander came to our position. He said that the enemy had not advanced because of supplementing food. The cloud of doubt in our hearts dissipated.
    Regiment Commander Luo inspected our fortifications, communication trenches, and camouflage, then sat down and said, "As soon as the small force sent by our Independent First Brigade was exposed in the Anse area, the enemy followed up and regarded them as the main force, concentrating five brigades to pounce on Anse. Today, the enemy's advance troops have occupied Anse, but they came up empty and got nothing." Hearing this, I was so excited that I wanted to jump up, and I admired the wise command of the field army leaders from the bottom of my heart. The enemy's main force was attracted away, and we would reap some cheap benefits in Qinghuabian.
    Before dawn on the 25th, the troops went up the mountain again. After dawn, I climbed to the mountainside to observe the positions of each company, wanting to see if there were any exposed places. I held up my binoculars and observed for a long time. Except for a few guards in plain clothes and soldiers responsible for observing signals, I couldn't see anything else. I also observed the friendly neighboring positions, and couldn't see any movement at all. The Chuan valley was quiet, only birds that had just left their nests in the morning were chasing and chirping in the sky, and the valley seemed particularly peaceful.
    Before long, a buzzing sound suddenly came from the sky. Two enemy planes circled over our position twice and then flew east, without strafing or dropping bombs. It seemed that they had not discovered us. After a while, the regimental command post called and said that the enemy had already set off, asking us to hide well and pay attention to observing the situation.
    The soldiers lay in the fortifications, clutching their rifles and grenades, staring intently at the direction of the valley entrance. It wasn't until after nine o'clock that the enemy's advance troops entered our battalion's attack area. Walking in the front were twenty or thirty enemies in plain clothes, some walking and some riding bicycles. It was obvious that they were the enemy's advance reconnaissance detachment. The enemy shot along the way, trying to get some information with this method of power reconnaissance, and also to embolden themselves. I was about to notify the companies to strictly hide and monitor the enemy when the telephone to the regimental command post rang.
    "Have you seen the enemy on the highway?" I knew it was Regiment Commander Luo as soon as I heard the voice.
    "Report to the Regiment Commander, more than twenty enemies have passed on the section of the highway we observed. It looks like the enemy's plainclothes reconnaissance."
    "Right! Now you immediately prepare, do not allow any exposure before the start of the attack, be sure to get all the enemies into the 'pocket' before acting, and pay attention to the regiment's attack signal."
    I discussed the regiment commander's instructions with the instructor, and sent a messenger to notify the companies, while also asking Staff Officer Chang Xin to organize the observation of the regiment's signals. Then, I hid under a small clump of trees with the instructor, concentrating on observing the enemy.
    After the enemy's plainclothes team passed, followed by a leading company of vanguards, searching forward along the mountain areas on both sides of the highway. Immediately after, a large group of people appeared, the main force of the enemy's 31st Brigade came in a mighty manner. Suddenly, billowing smoke and dust rose on the highway. The enemy lined up in three columns, some slung their guns across their backs, some carried burdens, and swaggered along. Mountain guns, mortars, and heavy machine guns were all tied to the backs of livestock. The officers rode on horseback, humming obscene tunes in their mouths, swaying and shouting at the soldiers to advance. The "da da" sound of horses' hooves and the noise of the bandits disturbed this peaceful and beautiful valley.
    A large group of enemies passed in front of us. The soldiers were anxiously waiting for the signal to attack. The messenger had already loaded the signal flares into the gun, and his eyes were fixed on the direction of the regimental command post. The bugler had also prepared his posture and raised the mouthpiece to his lips. Looking at their nervous appearance, I couldn't help but smile and comfort them, "Stay calm! Don't worry." Before I finished speaking, the attack order from the regimental command post came over the phone. I excitedly shouted "Fight!" and the messenger sent out the signal. At this time, countless red signal flares rose into the sky above the opposite West Mountain and the mountains on the left and right sides, dancing in the sky like festive fireworks. The loud and inspiring charge bugle call rose and fell, echoing through the valley. Red flags, as auxiliary signals, were also fluttering in the wind on various mountain tops.
    "Charge! Charge!" The shouts rang from the mountains on all sides. The soldiers, like little tigers, jumped out of the concealed trenches, one class following another, climbing over the hillsides, bypassing the mountain tops, and rushing straight down the mountain. At this moment, our troops appeared on every mountain top. The commanders waved red flags, directing the soldiers to launch an attack on the enemy. Before long, dust was rolling at the foot of the mountain, almost blocking even the fiery red sun.
    As soon as the battle started, the brother troops cut off the enemy's rear, and the troops ambushed on both sides of the highway launched a series of charges. The enemy was immediately thrown into chaos, and frightened groups of them climbed up the mountain slopes, attempting to seize the position, but it was too late. Before the enemy could deploy their forces, our troops pressed down from both sides.
    Company Commander Cui Yongchen of the Seventh Company led all the soldiers of the company at the forefront. While running, he directed the entire company to charge towards the enemies climbing up. They successively captured several mountains. Just as they were about to continue charging forward, the enemy had deployed their firepower and fiercely swept towards them. The soldiers had to lie down and crawl forward. At this time, Staff Officer Chang Xin happened to arrive with the two heavy machine guns of the battalion. I immediately ordered the heavy machine gun platoon leader to occupy the position, suppress the enemy's firepower, and cover the Seventh Company's charge. The soldiers of the machine gun platoon took less than two minutes to deploy the heavy machine guns and began firing at the enemy, making them unable to lift their heads. Before two bags of bullets were finished, the enemies in front were scrambling like ants on a hot pot. Company Commander Cui Yongchen immediately waved his arm at the soldiers lying down, "Comrades, charge! The time to make meritorious service has arrived!" The soldiers threw a row of grenades at the enemy, raised their bayonets, and charged down through the rising smoke and dust.
    The Seventh Company broke through the resisting enemy, and I led the Eighth and Ninth Companies down the mountain following behind the Seventh Company. There was only a small path at the bottom of the valley, and there was enemy crossfire from the mountains on both sides, making it very difficult for the troops to move in the mountain valley. At this time, the enemies at the foot of the mountain also set up mortars and bombarded our charging formation. Under the firepower cover of the brother troops, we avoided the enemy's firepower, went down the mountain along the mountain gullies on the side, and rushed straight towards the enemy in the Dachuan valley. At this time, the laying of the wired telephone had not kept up with the connection with the regimental headquarters, and we could only rely on the messenger and the pre-arranged communication signals to report the situation to the regiment. We also used bugle calls to direct the companies. The bugler continuously blew the charge bugle, urging the companies to advance. As soon as the Eighth Company and the Ninth Company rushed out of the valley entrance, they were mixed with the enemy and launched a fierce bayonet fight. The Chuan valley was filled with dust, and it was simply difficult to distinguish who was the enemy and who was our own people. Only the sound of bayonets clashing and the shouts of capturing prisoners were heard.
    At this moment, our main force poured down from all directions, like waves in the sea, one row after another, one class following another, using thunderous actions to press all the enemies into this two- or three-mile-wide Chuan valley, dividing them into groups. The enemy's formation was disrupted, they lost command, and fled in a panic in all directions.
    Seeing that the battle was developing so rapidly, I ordered the battalion's reserve team, the Second Platoon of the Ninth Company, to also join the battle. I said to the Second Platoon Leader Liu Fuxiang, "You have to run fast, or you will miss out!" This young man, who usually loved to talk and laugh, had a very serious expression at this time. He said to me, "Battalion Commander, don't worry, we will resolutely complete the mission!" After speaking, he waved his hand and led the entire platoon to chase after a group of escaping enemies in the southwest direction.
    After two hours of fierce fighting, the sound of gunfire gradually subsided, and the battle was coming to an end. The valley was filled with the bloody bodies of enemy soldiers, dead horses, and bloodstains, blocking the highway. The soldiers were escorting groups of dejected prisoners. Everywhere were busy crowds, some carrying weapons and materials to the mountains, some counting prisoners, and some searching for scattered enemies in the small mountain gullies. Looking at this scene of victory before me, how delightful it was! This day was exactly the sixth day after our withdrawal from Yan'an. The Hu Zongnan bandit army, which had been arrogant for a while, suffered its first disastrous defeat here. Three thousand men of the 31st Brigade were all buried in Qinghuabian.
    After the battle, the companies returned one after another. The company commanders and platoon leaders ran to the battalion headquarters to report the results and the number of prisoners. When counting the numbers, Second Platoon Leader Liu Fuxiang was nowhere to be seen. I was a little worried and kept looking towards the Dachuan valley, but the Dachuan valley was crowded with prisoners, and I couldn't see anything clearly. I had to climb to the mountain top and search with binoculars. After a while, I saw a group of people coming from the southwest corner. The person walking at the back, of medium height, chubby, carrying several rifles on his back, and holding a pistol in his right hand, I recognized at a glance as Liu Fuxiang. He and several soldiers were escorting twenty or so prisoners towards this side. I hurried down the mountain. Liu Fuxiang ran over like flying and reported, "Report Battalion Commander, I'm back!" Saying that, he turned his head and pulled out an enemy officer from the prisoners, saying, "He is Li Jiyun, the brigade commander of the 31st Brigade." I looked, this famous Kuomintang Major General Brigade Commander, wearing an American-style military uniform, covered in dirt, his face full of sweat, drooping his head, his eyes staring blankly at the ground. Looking at this executioner who had killed so many of our comrades, a burst of anger surged in my heart, and I waved to the messenger and said, "Take him down!"
    As soon as the prisoners were sent away, the instructor hurriedly asked Liu Fuxiang, "How did you catch him?" At this time, Liu Fuxiang regained his joyful and lively energy and said with relish, "As soon as we came out of the valley entrance, we chased after this group of enemies, shouting while chasing. The enemies surrendered one by one, but this guy kept running. I saw that he was an officer and kept chasing him to the foot of the mountain. Just as I was about to catch up, he turned to the back of the mountain and disappeared again. I followed the hillside to find him, and suddenly heard someone panting heavily behind a large rock. I went around and looked, and this guy was taking out a pistol from his waist. I shouted 'Hands up!' and this guy was frightened and softened, and the pistol fell to the ground. I asked him who he was, and he said he was an adjutant. I knew he wasn't honest, so I raised my gun and threatened him, 'If you don't tell the truth, I'll shoot you right away!' This guy raised his hands and said tremblingly, 'I...am Brigade Commander...Li...Jiyun!'" Liu Fuxiang gestured to Li Jiyun's embarrassing appearance at the time, and made the comrades present laugh.

    青化砭伏击战
    张沛然
    1947年3月，陕北的黄土高原上，响起了隆隆的炮声，明朗的天空，滚动着乌云似的硝烟。蒋介石集中了二十几万兵力，向我陕甘宁边区发动了进攻，把内战的大火烧到了延安。延安，千百万爱好和平人民注目的延安，中国人民的革命圣地，蒙受着战争的摧残。
    在这战斗的日日夜夜里，我们教导旅在延安南山一带抗击敌人，掩护党中央和延安各机关向后方转移。三月十八日黄昏，我们刚刚击退敌人白天最后的一次进攻，我正跟教导员丘德山研究着夜间的战斗，团长罗少伟打来电话，命令我营连夜向青化砭地区转移，准备接受新的战斗任务。一听到转移，我不禁“啊”出了声。团长大概听出了我的声音，立即接着说：“同志，要冷静一点，转移是为了争取更大的胜利！这次我们打得很好，敲掉了五千多敌人，更重要的是我们抗击了七天七夜，争取了时间，掩护了党中央和毛主席的安全转移。这就粉碎了敌人突然袭击延安的阴谋，这是最大的胜利，你们要把这个胜利的意义告诉战士们。”接着，命令我暂代理三营营长的职务，带领部队完成这次转移任务。
    夜里，我们从延安东南川里撤下来，经过大半夜的行军，在黎明时分到了青化砭以东的白家疙瘩村。部队一到，就封锁了消息，隐蔽地集结起来。
    二十一日，我们营的干部到团部去开会，团长一见到我们，就兴冲冲地说：“同志们，你们憋不住劲了吧？现在任务来了，我们马上就要打仗！”各营的干部一听，都神采焕发，异口同声地问：“真哪！什么任务？”
    团长用手中的红蓝铅笔点了点墙上的地图说：“胡宗南匪军占领了延安以后，正如我们所意料到的，非常狂妄，敌人一面派主力部队寻找我军决战，一面又分兵保护补给线。敌人既然有心决战，我们就迎合他一下。前天，我们独一旅派了一小股部队向延安西北方向撤退，诱敌主力北上安塞；我们主力部队就在青化砭找机会打一次伏击。根据最近的侦察情况，敌三十一旅进到拐峁村后，四处向群众打听青化砭的路程，又忙着准备干粮，看样子敌人要继续北进，占领青化砭这个交通要点。因此，我们主力要集结在青化砭南面，摆开一条口袋，把三十一旅吃掉。”
    团长的话音刚落，大家就纷纷要求：“团长！把主攻任务交给我们吧。战士们早就憋着一股劲，要好好地打一仗解解仇恨。”
    这时，魏志明政委说：“同志们，这是我们撤出延安后的第一仗，一定要打好，要狠狠地挫一挫敌人的气焰。回去给战士们好好讲一讲，让大家把刺刀擦得亮亮的，给敌人点厉害尝尝。”
    会议一结束，罗团长就带着营级干部，到前面侦察地形，随后又给各营划分了地区，具体交代了战斗任务。
    青化砭在延安的东北方向，正南面是一条三十里长的大川道，川道两旁全是光秃秃的大山，从咸阳经延安到榆林的公路就从这条川里经过。这真是一处打伏击的好地形，只要敌人钻进来，我们从两面一夹攻，叫他一个也跑不掉。
    二十四日拂晓前，部队隐蔽地进入了阵地。第一纵队埋伏在西山，第二纵队和我们教导旅埋伏在东山，两路主力部队像一把张开口的铁钳，把钳口伸向南面，待敌人后尾部队通过后，由埋伏在南面的部队，从东西两面猛烈夹击，切断敌人退路，封住钳口，而后沿公路向北攻击，并以新四旅占领青化砭东北高地，从正面堵击敌人。部队整整埋伏了一天，却一直没有等着敌人。指挥员们拿着望远镜观察，连敌人的影子也没有发现，大家都暗暗地猜疑：难道我们的行动计划被敌人识破了？傍晚，团长到我们阵地上来了，他说敌人因补充粮食没有前进，我们心里的一团疑云消散了。
    罗团长对我们的工事、交通壕、伪装进行了检查，然后坐下来说：“我们独一旅派出的小部队在安塞地区一暴露，敌人就跟上去了，把他们当成了主力，一下集中了五个旅的兵力向安塞扑去。今天，敌人先头部队已经占领安塞，可是扑了个空，什么也没有捞到。”听到这情况，我兴奋得要跳起来，打心眼里赞佩野战军首长的英明指挥。敌人的主力被吸引过去了，我们就在青化砭捞它一把便宜。
    二十五日天还未亮，部队又上了山。天亮后，我爬到半山腰对各连的阵地进行观察，想看看有没有暴露的地方，我举起望远镜观察了很久，除能看到几个穿着便衣的警戒和负责观察信号的战士外，其他什么也看不到。我又向友邻阵地观察了一番，也一点动静都看不出来。大川里静悄悄的，只有早晨出巢的鸟雀在天空追逐着，啼鸣着，山谷里显得格外的宁静。
    不多时，天空中突然传来嗡嗡的声音，两架敌机在我们阵地上空绕了两圈，又向东飞去了，既没有俯冲扫射，也没有丢炸弹，看样子没有发现我们。过了一会，团指挥所来电话说敌人已经出发了，叫我们很好隐蔽，注意观察情况。
    战士们爬在工事里，紧握着步枪和手榴弹，目不转睛地注视着沟口的方向。直等到九点多钟，敌人的先头部队才进到我们营的冲击地区。走在最前面的是二三十个穿便衣的敌人，有的徒步，有的骑脚踏车，一看就知道是敌人的先头侦察分队，敌人一路边走边打枪，想用这种威力侦察的手段搞到些情况，也给自己壮胆。我正要通知各连要严格隐蔽，监视敌人，通往团指挥所的电话铃响了。
    “你们看到公路上的敌人吗？”我一听声音，就知道是罗团长。
    “报告团长，从我们观察的这一段公路上过去了二十多敌人，看样子是敌人的便衣侦察。”
    “对！现在你们立刻作好准备，在冲锋开始前不准有一点暴露，一定要把敌人全部装进
  ‘口袋’再动手，要注意团里的冲锋讯号。”
    我把团长的指示和教导员研究了一下，一面派通讯员通知各连，一面叫参谋常鑫同志组织观察团里的讯号，随后，便和教导员爬在一棵小树丛下隐着身子，全神贯注地观察敌人。
    敌人的便衣队过后，紧接着是一支先头尖兵连，沿着公路两侧的山地搜索前进。紧接着后面就出现了大队人马，敌三十一旅的主力浩浩荡荡的进来了。顿时，公路上扬起滚滚烟尘。敌人排成三路纵队，有的斜背着枪，有的挑着担子，大摇大摆地走着。山炮，迫击炮，重机枪都捆在牲口背上。当官的骑在马上，嘴里还哼着下流的小调，一摇一晃地吆喊着士兵前进。马蹄的“??”声，匪徒们的吵闹声，搅乱了这宁静而幽美的山谷。
    大队敌人从我们面前过去了。战士们都焦急地等待着冲锋的讯号。通讯员早把讯号弹装进枪内，眼睛直望着团指挥所的方向；司号员也打好了姿势，把喇叭嘴提到嘴唇上。看着他们这副紧张的样子，我不由得笑了，安慰他们说：“沉住气！别着急。”话声未落，电话上传来团指挥所的冲锋命令，我激动地喊了一声“打”，通讯员便把讯号发了出去。此时，对面西山上和左右两侧山头上空，升起了无数颗红色讯号弹，像节日的焰火一样，在天空飞舞。嘹亮激昂的冲锋号声此起彼落，响彻山谷。作为辅助讯号的红旗，也在各个山头上迎风飘舞起来。
    “冲啊！冲啊！”喊声从四面山头上响了起来，战士们个个像小老虎一般，从掩蔽沟里跳出来，一班跟着一班，爬过山坡，绕过山头，直向山下扑去。此刻，各个山头上都出现了我们的部队，指挥员们挥动着红旗，指挥着战士们向敌人发起冲锋。不一会儿，山脚下尘土滚滚，几乎连火红的太阳也遮住了。
    战斗一打响，兄弟部队就截断了敌人的后尾，埋伏在公路两侧的部队一阵冲杀，敌人当下就乱了套，吓得成群成群地往山坡上爬来，企图强占阵地，但是已经晚了。等不到敌人展开兵力，我们的部队就从两面压了下去。
    七连长崔永臣带着全连战士冲在最前面，他一边跑，一边指挥全连向爬上来的敌人冲去。他们连续攻下了几座山，正要向前面继续冲锋时，敌人已展开了火力，猛烈地向他们扫射。战士们不得不卧倒匍匐前进。这时，正好参谋常鑫带着营里的两挺重机枪赶上来了。我立刻命令重机枪排长占领阵地，压住敌人的火力，掩护七连冲锋，机枪排的战士没用两分钟，就把重机枪布置好，向敌人开始了射击，直打得敌人抬不起头。两袋子弹没打完，前面的敌人就像热锅上的蚂蚁一样乱钻。七连长崔永臣立刻向卧倒的战士们挥动了一下手臂：“同志们，冲啊！立功的时机到啦！”战士们向敌人甩出了一排手榴弹，端起刺刀，迎着炸起的烟雾和尘土冲了下去。
    七连冲垮了抵抗的敌人，我就带着八、九连随着七连后尾冲了下去。沟底只有一条小路，两边山上都有敌人的侧射火力，部队在山沟里运动十分困难。这时山下的敌人也架起了迫击炮，向我们冲击的队形轰击。我们在兄弟部队的火力掩护下，避开敌人的火力，顺着侧面的山沟下了山，一直向大川道里的敌人冲去。这时有线电话的架设已经跟不上和团部的联系，只有靠通讯员和事先规定的联络讯号向团里报告情况。我们对各连也是用号声来指挥，司号员接连不断的吹着冲锋号，督促各连前进。八连和九连一冲出沟口，就跟敌人混搅在一起，展开了激烈的白刃搏斗。川道里尘土漫天，简直很难分清那是敌人那是自己人了，只听到一阵阵刺刀的撞击声，和抓俘虏的喊声。
    正在这时，我们的大部队从四面八方涌下来，像大海里的波浪一样，一排接着一排，一班跟着一班，以迅雷般的动作，把敌人全部压到这二三里宽的川道里，一群一群的分割开来。敌人的建制被打乱了，失去了指挥，慌慌乱乱地向四处逃跑。
    我看到战斗发展如此迅速，便命令营的预备队九连二排也投入战斗。并对二排长刘福祥说：“你们可要快跑，慢了就落空啦！”这个平时爱说爱笑的青年人，这时脸色十分严肃的对我说：“营长，你放心，我们坚决完成任务！”说完一摆手就带着全排向西南方向一群逃跑的敌人追去。
    激战了两小时，枪声逐渐稀落下来，战斗已接近尾声。山谷里到处躺着血肉模糊的敌兵尸体，死马，血迹斑斑，堵塞了公路。战士们押着一群一群垂头搭脑的俘虏。到处都是忙忙碌碌的人群，有的往山上搬运武器物资，有的清点俘虏，有的去小山沟里搜索逃散的敌人。望着眼前这一片胜利景象，多么叫人高兴啊！这一天，正是我们撤出延安的第六天，狂妄一时的胡宗南匪军，在这里遭到了第一次惨败，三十一旅的三千人马全部葬送在青化砭。
    战斗结束后，各连都陆续回来了，连长、排长们纷纷跑到营部来报告战果和俘虏的数字，清点人数时，独不见二排长刘福祥。我有些担心，不住地向大川里张望，但大川里挤满了俘虏，一点也看不清。我不得不爬到山头上举起望远镜四下搜寻，不大一会，见从西南角走来一群人，走在最后边的那人，中等个子，胖胖的背着几支步枪，右手还提着一支手枪，我一眼就认出是刘福祥。他和几个战士押着二十来个俘虏向这边走来。我急忙赶下山去。刘福祥飞也似地跑来报告说：“报告营长，我回来啦！”说着回过头去，从俘虏里揪出个敌人军官，说：“他就是三十一旅旅长李纪云。”我一看，这个赫赫有名的国民党少将旅长，穿着一身美式军服，浑身是土，满脸流汗，搭拉着脑袋，两眼直呆呆地望着地皮。望着这个杀害过我们多少同志的刽子手，我心里顿时涌起一股怒火，便向通讯员一摆手说：“把他带下去！”
    俘虏一送走，教导员急忙问刘福祥：“你们是怎么捉住的？”这时刘福祥又恢复了他那喜笑活泼的劲儿，津津有味地说：“我们一出沟口，就向这伙敌人追去，一边追一边喊话，敌人一个个都投降了，只有这家伙还一个劲地跑，我一看是个当官的，就一直追到山根，眼看要追上了，一拐到后山角又不见了。我顺着山坡找去，忽然听到一块大石头背后，有人大口大口的喘粗气，我绕过去一看，这家伙正从腰里掏手枪，我喊了一声‘举起手来！’这家伙便吓软瘫了，手枪掉到地上。我问他是什么人，他说是副官。我知道他不老实，把枪一举，吓唬他说：‘你不说实话，我马上枪毙了你！’这家伙才把双手一举，哆哆嗦嗦地说：‘我……是旅长……李……纪云！’”刘福祥一边说一边比划着李纪云当时的狼狈相，把在场的同志们逗得哈哈大笑。（附图片）
