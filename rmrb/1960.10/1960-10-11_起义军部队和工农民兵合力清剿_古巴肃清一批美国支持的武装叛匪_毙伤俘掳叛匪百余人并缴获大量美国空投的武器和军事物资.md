Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 9th: The Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces Ministry announced today that the armed counter-revolutionary bandit gangs carrying out rebellions in the Escambray Mountains with direct American support have been wiped out. It was announced that after 29 days of clearing, out of this group of 150 counter-revolutionary bandits, three were killed, four were wounded, one hundred and two were captured, and the rest have scattered and are being captured one by one by the militia.

The communique pointed out that the United States equipped these counter-revolutionaries with a complete set of new weapons. The communique said that an American four-engine aircraft invaded Cuban airspace at 2:00 AM on September 29th and airdropped a large number of weapons and military supplies over the Escambray Mountains by parachute. These included a complete set of modern weapons, the latest communications equipment that can change radio frequencies every day of the year, detailed nylon maps of the area, codes, and a large number of other military supplies. The communique said that all these weapons were made in the United States and have clear brands and numbers. Obviously, the complete equipment could only be directly supplied by the American arms storage authorities and military institutions.

The communique pointed out, "The purpose of airdropping these weapons is to strengthen the forces of the counter-revolutionaries who are colluding with foreign interest groups that are hostile to our country. Supported by former Batista soldiers and privileged classes affected by the revolution, they are attempting to turn this mountainous area into a breeding ground for counter-revolution."

The communique said that in order to counter this conspiracy, the revolutionary government mobilized and trained thousands of peasant militia in Escambray, led by officers of the insurgent army, and supported by worker militias. After twenty-nine days of fighting, the entire group of traitors was annihilated.

The communique also announced the list of prisoners and the list of weapons seized. Those captured included Plinio Prieto, the highest person in charge of counter-revolutionary organizations active in Cuba under American protection, Sinnesio Walsh Rios, the head of the counter-revolutionaries active in the Escambray Mountains, and Porfirio Humberto Ramirez Ruiz, the second-in-command of the counter-revolution.

The communique said that these captured counter-revolutionaries will be tried by the revolutionary court in Santa Clara next Wednesday.

Speaking of the personnel who were sacrificed and injured in the battle, the communique said, "The blood of insurgent soldiers and workers and peasants has once again been shed in the common struggle to defend the revolution and defend the motherland, and to oppose the domestic and foreign sinister interest groups who stubbornly attempt to set obstacles on the road to liberation and attempt to enslave our people. The people, loyal to the slogan of 'Swear to defend the motherland to the death,' are waging all necessary battles until the enemy is convinced that the revolution is indestructible."

    起义军部队和工农民兵合力清剿
    古巴肃清一批美国支持的武装叛匪
    毙伤俘掳叛匪百余人并缴获大量美国空投的武器和军事物资
    新华社哈瓦那9日电　古巴革命武装部今天发表公报说，在美国直接支持下在埃斯坎布拉伊山进行叛乱活动的武装反革命匪帮已被肃清。据宣布，经过二十九天的清剿，这批为数一百五十人的反革命匪徒中，有三名被击毙，四名被打伤，一百零二人被俘获，其余的都已溃散，正在一个个地落入民兵手中。
    公报指出，美国以整套的新式武器装备这批反革命分子。公报说，一架四引擎的美国飞机9月29日清晨二时侵入古巴领空，在埃斯坎布拉伊山上空用降落伞投掷了大批武器和军事物资，其中包括整套的现代化武器、可以在全年中每天改变广播频率的最新式的通讯设备、尼龙制的这个地区的详细地图、密码和大量其他军事物资。公报说，所有这些武器都是美国制造的，上面有明显的牌号和号码。显然，完备的设备只能是由美国储存武器的当局和军事机构直接供给的。
    公报指出，“投掷这些武器的目的在于加强反革命分子的力量，这些反革命分子同与我国为敌的外国利益集团勾结在一起，在巴蒂斯塔前军人和受到革命影响的特权阶层的支持下，企图把这个山区变成反革命的温床。”
    公报说，为了反击这个阴谋，革命政府动员和训练了埃斯坎布拉伊的数以千计的农民民兵，他们由起义军军官领导，并取得工人民兵的支持。经过二十九天的战斗，全歼了这股叛徒。
    公报同时公布了俘虏的名单和缴获武器的清单。被俘人员包括美国庇护下的反革命组织在古巴活动的最高负责人普利尼奥·普烈托、在埃斯坎布拉伊山活动的反革命分子的首脑西内西奥·瓦耳奇·里奥斯和反革命第二头目波尔菲里奥·伦贝尔托·拉米雷斯·鲁易斯。
    公报说，这些被俘的反革命分子将在下星期三在圣克拉拉城受革命法庭的审判。
    公报谈到在战斗中牺牲和受伤的人员说，“起义军战士和工人、农民的鲜血又一次洒在保卫革命和保卫祖国、反对顽固地企图在解放的道路上设置障碍和企图奴役我国人民的国内外罪恶利益集团的共同斗争中。人民忠于‘誓死保卫祖国’的口号，正在进行着一切必要的战斗，直到使敌人确信，革命是不可摧毁的。”
