Introduction to the "Wind-Suction Stove"

I. Required Raw Materials: Mainly soil and adobe bricks, also a small amount of stone, brick, and wood. In areas where available, some lime or cement can also be used.

II. Construction: Composed of eight main parts: stove platform, fire door, ash pit, fire pit, combustion chamber, flue, chimney, and wind-gathering chamber.

	1. Stove Platform: Determined by the number of pots and their size. The standard design for accommodating two pots is: 3.3 *chi* (Chinese foot, hereinafter the same) wide and 7 *chi* long. For each additional pot, the width remains the same, and the length increases by 4 to 6 *chi*.
	2. Fire Door: Located at the upper part of the front edge of the stove platform, running vertically down to the fire bed (i.e., the upper part of the grate). The fire door has a diameter of 6 to 8 *cun* (Chinese inch), and is 6 to 7 *cun* away from the edge of the pot.
	3. Ash Pit: Located in front of the stove platform, dug about 2 *chi* below ground level and connected to the fire pit.
	4. Fire Pit: Located below the fire door and closely connected to the ash pit, 1.5 to 2 *chi* wide, and connected to the bottom of the first pot.
	5. Combustion Chamber: Modeled after the shape of the pot, the fire inlet should be smaller than the outlet, forming a horn shape.
	6. Flue: Runs from the fire pit to the smoke outlet of the last pot, with a slope of about 15 degrees, lower in the front and higher in the back.
	7. Chimney: Connected to the smoke outlet of the last pot, more than 9 *chi* high, with an outlet diameter of about 7 *cun* and a bottom diameter of about 3 *chi*, tapered upwards to form a horn shape.
	8. Wind-Gathering Chamber: Located below the chimney, dug 3.5 to 4 *chi* below ground level, with a diameter of about 3 *chi*.

III. Points to Note:

	1. For hygiene and safety, the chimney and stove opening should be located outside the kitchen.
	2. When cooking, seal off the connection between the ash pit and the fire pit, so that only one person needs to add firewood. (Attached image)

    “吸风灶”介绍
    一、所需原料：主要是土和土坯，还需要少量的石料、砖料和木料，有条件的地区还可用一部分石灰或洋灰。
    二、构造：有锅台、灶火门、掏灰坑、火坑、锅膛、火道、烟囱、藏风洞八大部分构成。1、锅台：根据盘锅多少和锅大小而定。安两口锅的，其标准设计是：锅台面积宽三点三尺（市尺，下同），长七尺。每增一锅，宽度不变，长度加四至六尺。2、灶火门：设在锅台最前沿的上部，直立前沿一直通往火底，（即炉条上部）火门直径六至八寸，距锅沿六至七寸。3、掏灰坑：设在锅台前面，从地平面下挖二尺左右，和火坑相连。4、火坑：位于进火口下部和掏灰坑紧连，宽一尺半至二尺，与第一锅底相通。5、锅膛：仿锅而定，其进火口要掌握进小出大，喇叭形。6、火道：从火坑一直通向末锅出火口，前低后高，坡度十五度左右。7、烟囱：和末锅出火口相通，高九尺以上，出烟口直径七寸左右，底直径三尺左右，下粗上细成喇叭形。8、藏风洞：在烟囱底下，从地面下挖三尺半至四尺，直径三尺左右。
    三、应注意的几个问题：
    1、为了卫生和安全，烟囱和灶口应设在厨房以外。2、在做饭时，把掏灰坑和火坑相通处塞死，只用一人添柴烧火即可。（附图片）

    说明：①锅与锅距离4—6寸　②锅台阶为2寸左右
     ③安锅的多少可根据需要，最好3—4个锅
