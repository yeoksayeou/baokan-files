Firmly Implement the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" System and Further Improve Autumn Harvest Work
Editor's Note: The Jicun Management District of Xingfu People's Commune in Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, promoted a mass movement of careful harvesting and detailed threshing to strive for exceeding production targets by publishing a trial calculation plan for the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system during the autumn harvest, achieving "no loss of grain ears during harvesting and transportation, and no loss of grain kernels during threshing and storage." This experience is very good and worthy of learning in various regions.

Earnest implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system plays an important role in mobilizing the enthusiasm of production teams and the broad masses of commune members, promoting production development, and improving management levels. However, whether the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system can be implemented well depends on the understanding of the significance of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system by the cadres of the commune and production teams. In order to better complete the tasks of the Three Autumns (autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing), it is hoped that all communes should attach importance to and resolutely implement the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system.

Taiyuan Dispatch from our newspaper on the 8th: The Jicun Management District of Xingfu People's Commune in Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, recently systematically summarized the experience of implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system during the summer harvest, and conducted a trial calculation of the implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" plan for autumn harvest crops. After the trial calculation results were announced to the masses, the autumn harvest generally achieved clean fields and clean threshing grounds, and the actual yield of most production teams increased.

The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the experience of the Jicun Management District in promoting careful harvesting and detailed threshing by publishing a trial calculation plan for the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, while careful harvesting and detailed threshing promoted the movement to exceed production targets, plays an important role in mobilizing the enthusiasm of production teams and the broad masses of commune members, promoting production development, and improving management levels. Therefore, it is required that all management districts seriously study the experience of the Jicun Management District and resolutely implement the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system.

Since the beginning of spring plowing, the Jicun Management District has implemented the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" plan for autumn harvest crops, greatly improving the production enthusiasm of commune members. Despite the successive occurrences of spring drought, summer drought, and autumn drought, all production teams rationally used labor and vigorously engaged in technical innovation, turning 512 mu of old dry land into irrigated land through South-to-North Water Diversion, water lifting irrigation, and other methods. For the 1,400 mu of autumn fields without water conservancy conditions, universal rolling after three plows and four harrowings also ensured full seedling emergence. During the heading and grain-filling period of the crops, various power sources were organized for round-the-clock irrigation and inter-tillage to conserve soil moisture, ensuring the normal growth of more than 3,400 mu of severely drought-affected crops. During the severe autumn drought, late-stage management was further strengthened, so the autumn crops in the management district generally grew well.

Over the past nine months, some new situations have emerged in the implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system in the Jicun Management District: Due to the impact of natural disasters, some production teams, in the struggle against disasters, increased their work efforts but achieved very good results; individual production teams relaxed their leadership and did not produce according to the original contracted work procedures, originally arranging for early autumn crops, but ended up planting late autumn crops, so the yield, labor, and investment needed to be adjusted. In addition, some small teams had their labor transferred, or vegetable plots were assigned to the canteens, etc. These problems brought some difficulties to the implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system. For example, the Second Production Team was rewarded for exceeding production by 225 yuan in the summer (calculated based on net income, same below), but upon seeing that the autumn harvest would be reduced, the captain, Li Shenggui, advocated that the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system not be implemented in the autumn. This proposal was immediately agreed to by some teams that had reduced production. However, this opinion immediately aroused opposition from the teams that increased production and the teams that had not reduced production much in the summer but would greatly increase production in the autumn. Ma Yongyi, the captain of the First Production Team, said: "Our team reduced production in the summer and spared no effort to strive for exceeding production in the autumn, all for the sake of fulfilling the Three Guarantees. Even if production is reduced again in the autumn, we must seriously find the reasons and educate the commune members to work hard in the future." The teams that exceeded production in the summer and will also exceed production in the autumn all agreed to implement the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system.

In order to ensure the implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, rationally handle the relationship between the production-increasing teams and the disaster-affected teams, and promote the smooth progress of the Three Autumns, the Party branch of the management district organized the masses to discuss the question of "whether or not the 'Three Guarantees and One Reward' system needs to be implemented this autumn." After debate, it was unanimously agreed that the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system must be earnestly implemented. Commune member Ma Tianyuan said that the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, like engaging in competitions, can encourage and promote each other. Commune member Zhang Huanhai said that the implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system can make people harvest more carefully and thresh better. After listening to everyone's discussions, Li Shenggui, the captain of the Second Team, who had previously advocated not implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, also felt that he was in the wrong and said: "Our team will try every means to reduce the reduction in production, not reduce production, and even exceed production in the autumn harvest."

When the management district conducted a trial calculation of the implementation plan for the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, the Party branch improved and strengthened the organizational leadership of the "Three Guarantees" committee and put forward some specific handling methods based on the opinions of the masses. For example, it was stipulated that if the seedlings were not complete due to disasters, and production was reduced because repeated measures still failed to ensure full seedlings, the contracted production targets would be adjusted according to the number of seedlings that emerged. However, those who suffered reduced production because they did not loosen the soil after rain would be compensated for production according to regulations. For those who had more labor transferred, the average yield and value that each laborer should produce would be deducted from the total contracted production of the team. If the contracted production targets were too high and the actual production did not reach the original contracted production targets, the average contracted production targets reached in the entire district could be used as the boundary for rewards and punishments; teams that were higher than the average level would be rewarded as over-production teams according to the original methods; teams that were lower than the average level would be compensated for production as appropriate. In order to overcome the deviations of attaching importance to output value and neglecting output, attaching importance to main products and neglecting by-products, and attaching importance to quantity and neglecting quality, it was also stipulated that the method of calculating over-production and reduced production only based on net income would be abolished, and economic crops such as cotton, oil crops, vegetables, and melons would be uniformly calculated for rewards and punishments based on output value, and grain crops would be calculated for rewards and punishments based on output.

Based on the specific methods proposed by the Party branch, the entire management district conducted a trial calculation based on the latest production situation on the basis of verifying the "Three Guarantees." The results of the trial calculation were: the average output value of the entire district completed 66% of the contracted production target, and the grain output completed 74% of the average contracted production target. Using this level as the boundary for rewards and punishments, the output value of the First Production Team exceeded production by 9%, and the grain output was reduced by 3%. According to regulations, no compensation is required for production reductions below 5%; 20% of the over-production part of the output value is returned to the team, 10% is awarded to model commune members, and 70% is distributed to commune members based on labor days. The output value of the Second Production Team was reduced by 1.2%, and no compensation is required according to regulations; the grain output of the team exceeded production by 15%, and 90% was purchased by the management district in cash, while 10% was awarded to commune members. The output value of the Third Production Team exceeded production by 14.8%, 20% is returned to the team, 10% is awarded to model commune members, and 70% is distributed to commune members based on labor days; the grain output of the team exceeded production by 5.3%, and 90% is purchased by the management district in cash, while 10% is awarded to commune members. The output value of the Fourth Production Team was reduced by 0.9%, and the grain output was reduced by 6.5%, and compensation should be given according to regulations. After the trial calculation results were announced to the masses, cadres and the masses unanimously believed that the trial calculation pointed out the direction of the struggle, and they must carefully harvest and thresh, returning every grain to the household. A trend of over-producing teams striving for even more over-production and reducing-production teams striving for less reduction and no reduction has been formed in the entire management district. The 220 mu of corn, more than 300 mu of millet, more than 460 mu of broomcorn millet, more than 500 mu of beans, and the cotton that has begun to be picked in the entire management district have all generally achieved no loss of grain ears during harvesting and transportation, and no loss of grain kernels during threshing and storage, and the fields and threshing grounds are all harvested and threshed cleanly. All production teams have generally been swept up in a heat wave of autumn harvest competitions in order to obtain more grain and increase more income this autumn.

    坚决贯彻三包一奖  进一步做好三秋工作
    执行三包一奖制　促进细收超包产
    冀村管理区公布三包一奖试算方案，细收细打成风气
    编者按：山西省汾阳县幸福人民公社冀村管理区在秋收当中通过公布“三包一奖”兑现试算方案，促进了细收细打争超产的群众运动的开展，做到了“收割拉运不丢穗，打场入仓不丢颗”。这个经验很好，值得各地学习。
    认真执行“三包一奖”制度，对于调动生产小队和广大社员的积极性，促进生产的发展和管理水平的提高，都有重要作用。但能否执行好“三包一奖”制度，关键在于公社和生产队的干部对“三包一奖”制度的意义的认识。为了更好地完成三秋工作的任务，希望各公社都应该重视并坚决贯彻执行“三包一奖”制度。
    本报太原8日电山西省汾阳县幸福人民公社冀村管理区，最近系统总结了夏季执行“三包一奖制”的经验，并对秋收作物的“三包一奖”方案的执行情况，进行了试算。试算结果在群众中公布后，秋收普遍作到地净、场光，大多数生产队的实产量都有了增加。
    中共山西省委认为：冀村管理区通过公布
  “三包一奖”试算方案，促进了细收细打，同时，细收细打又促进了超包产运动的经验，对于调动生产小队和广大社员的积极性，促进生产的发展和管理水平的提高，都有重要的作用。因此，要求各个管理区认真学习冀村管理区的经验，坚决执行“三包一奖”制度。
    春耕开始，冀村管理区就推行了秋收作物的
  “三包一奖”方案，大大提高了社员的生产积极性。尽管春旱、伏旱、秋旱相继发生，由于各生产队都合理使用劳动力，大搞技术革新，使五百一十二亩老旱地利用南水北调、提水浇地等办法，变成了水地；对于没有水利条件的一千四百亩秋田，经过耕三耙四普遍滚压，也保证了全苗出土。在禾苗吐穗、孕穗期间，又组织各种动力实行日夜轮浇，并进行中耕保墒，使三千四百多亩受旱严重的作物，保证了正常生长。在严重的秋旱期间，继续加强了后期管理，因而，管理区的秋季作物普遍生长良好。
    冀村管理区九个多月来，在执行“三包一奖制”中曾出现了一些新情况：由于自然灾害的影响，有的生产队在抗灾斗争中，因为措施得力，增加的工不多，效果却很好；也有个别生产队放松了领导，未按原包工工序生产，原来安排的是早秋作物，结果种成了晚秋作物，因而产量、用工和投资都需要调整。另外，也有些小队因为劳动力调走了，或菜地划归了食堂等等。这些问题给执行“三包一奖”制带来了一些困难。如第二生产队夏季超产二百二十五元（以纯收入计算，下同）受到奖励，但看到秋季将减产，队长李生贵便主张秋季不执行“三包一奖制”。这个主张，当时即有一些减产队表示同意。但是，这种意见立即引起增产队和夏季减产不多而秋季将是大大增产的队的反对。第一生产队队长马永义说：
  “我们队夏天减了产，费尽力气争取秋天超产，就是为了三包兑现。即使秋天再减产，也要认真找原因，教育社员往后好好干。”夏季超产而秋季亦将是超产的队都同意贯彻执行“三包一奖制”。
    管理区党支部为了确保“三包一奖制”的执行，合理处理增产队与受灾队的关系，促进三秋工作的顺利开展，便以“今秋是否需要执行‘三包一奖制’”为题，组织群众讨论。经过辩论，一致认为“三包一奖制”必须认真执行。社员马天元说，“三包一奖”和搞竞赛一样，能互相鼓励，互相促进。社员张焕孩说，执行了“三包一奖制”能使人收割的更细，收打的更好。听了大家这些议论，原先主张不执行“三包一奖制”的二队队长李生贵也觉自己理亏，并表示：“我们队要想尽办法，作到秋收少减产，不减产，甚至还要超产。”
    在管理区对“三包一奖”的兑现方案进行试算的时候，党支部健全和加强了“三包”委员会的组织领导，并根据群众意见提出了一些具体的处理办法。例如规定因灾出苗不全，经过一再采取措施仍无法保证全苗以致减产者，按捉苗成数调整包产指标。但因雨后没有进行疏土，而遭到减产者，照规定赔产。对多调了劳力的，由本队包产总数内减去每个劳力平均应生产的产量和产值。如果包产指标偏高，实产达不到原包产指标时，可按全区平均达到的包产指标作为奖惩界限，高于平均水平的为超产队，按原定办法受奖；低于平均水平的为减产队，酌情赔产。为了克服重视产值忽视产量，重视主产品忽视副产品，重视数量忽视质量等偏向，还规定了取消只按纯收入计算超产减产的办法，改为棉花、油料、蔬菜、瓜类等经济作物统一按产值计算奖惩，粮食作物按产量计算奖惩。
    全管理区根据党支部提出的具体办法，在核实“三包”的基础上，依据最近的生产情况进行了试算。试算的结果是：全区产值平均完成包产指标的66％，粮食产量完成平均包产的74％。以此水平作为奖惩界限，第一生产队产值超产9％，粮食产量减产3％。按规定减产在5％以下的不赔产；产值的超产部分以20％归队，以10％奖励模范社员，70％按劳动日分给社员。第二生产队产值减产1.2％，按规定不赔产；该队粮食产量超产15％，除90％由管理区用现金收买外，10％奖给社员。第三生产队产值超产14.8％，20％归队，10％奖励模范社员，70％按劳动日分给社员；该队粮食产量超产5.3％，除90％归管理区现金收买外，10％奖励给社员。第四生产队产值减产0.9％，粮食产量减产6.5％，按规定应予赔产。试算结果在群众中公布以后，干部和群众一致认为试算指出了奋斗方向，一定要细收细打，颗粒还家。超产队争取更超产，减产队力争少减产和不减产的风气已在全管理区形成。全管理区所收获的二百二十亩玉米，三百多亩谷子，四百六十多亩糜子，五百多亩豆类，以及已开始采摘的棉花，普遍做到了收割拉运不丢穗，打场入仓不丢颗，从田间到场面都是收打得干干净净。各生产队为今年秋季拿到更多的粮食和增加更多的收入，普遍卷入了秋收竞赛热潮。
