Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, October 29th. The head of the General Staff of the Algerian National Liberation Army, in an interview with Xinhua reporters today on the eve of the sixth anniversary of the Algerian National Independence War, said, "The Algerian people are prepared to wage a long-term armed struggle until Algeria achieves independence."

He said, "Imperialists cannot adapt to history or the trend of the times. They will not stop automatically. The only way out for us is to strike them hard as they did in Indochina."

Pointing to the shell of a 155mm American artillery shell on the table, the official said, "This is an American weapon that fell on Algerian territory. American imperialism is our common enemy and the head of imperialism. Without American support, French colonialism could not wage this war."

He said that on November 1, 1954, the Algerian people launched an armed struggle in 40 places across the country and established the first base area in the Aures Mountains. The Algerian National Liberation War has achieved great success in the past six years. The army has grown from an initial 3,000 to today's 130,000 regular troops. The Algerian National Liberation Army has fought 800,000 French colonial troops equipped with modern equipment, fighting throughout Algerian territory, mobilizing every Algerian. Now, except for some large cities, the Algerian National Liberation Army controls vast Algerian territory in six war zones. He said that a unified political and military democratic regime has been widely established in Algerian territory, which mobilizes and unites the masses of people throughout the country, paralyzing the colonial administrative apparatus. He emphasized that the leadership of the National Liberation Army has been strengthened, and the General Staff established at the beginning of this year has unified the leadership of the army nationwide.

He said that the situation of the Algerian National Liberation War has been developing day by day in the past six years. The Algerian army has gained rich experience in armed struggle after more than a dozen important battles such as Kabylie, Collo, and Awdni. He said that at this stage, Algeria's armed forces mainly adopt guerrilla warfare, establish many strongholds across the country to disperse the enemy's forces, and at the same time, concentrate superior forces to carry out mobile warfare and eliminate the enemy's effective strength when conditions permit. He said that the strategy and tactics of the Algerian National Liberation War are similar to China's past national liberation war, mainly adopting guerrilla warfare and gradually transforming from guerrilla warfare to mobile warfare. He said that the French colonial army used to adopt encirclement tactics, but now it is implementing large-scale "mopping-up operations" in an attempt to isolate the Algerian National Liberation Army and separate the National Liberation Army from the people, but French imperialism is destined to fail. He said that the Algerian people's army has a high degree of awareness and an invincible belief. At the same time, the current situation is becoming more and more favorable to the development of the Algerian revolutionary war.

He said that the reason for the victory of the Algerian National Liberation War is that this war is a just war. For 130 years, the Algerian people have never stopped fighting the invaders and have never succumbed to French imperialism. The Algerian army and people are united. The army comes from the people and receives the full support of the people. The Algerian war is a just war, so it has the support of people all over the world.

The military leader said that the purpose of the Algerian armed struggle is to overthrow colonial rule and establish a democratic republic. He said that the Algerian people and the National Liberation Army will wage unremitting struggle for this purpose.

    阿民族解放军总参谋部负责人对新华社记者发表谈话
    阿尔及利亚决心以武装斗争求民族独立
    帝国主义者不会自动停手，只有狠狠地给予打击才是出路
    阿尔及利亚民族解放军已在革命战争中发展壮大，他们有高度觉悟和必胜信念
    新华社突尼斯29日电　阿尔及利亚民族解放军总参谋部负责人今天在阿尔及利亚民族独立战争六周年前夕接见新华社记者时说，“阿尔及利亚人民准备进行长期的武装斗争，直到阿尔及利亚获得独立为止”。
    他说，“帝国主义者不可能适应历史、潮流，他们不会自动停手，只有像在印度支那那样狠狠地给予打击才是我们的出路。”
    这位负责人指着桌子上的一个直径一百五十五毫米的美国炮弹的弹壳说，“这是落在阿尔及利亚领土上的美国武器。美国帝国主义是我们的共同敌人，是帝国主义的头子。如果没有美国的支持，法国殖民主义就不可能进行这种战争。”
    他说，1954年11月1日，阿尔及利亚人民在全国四十个地方掀起了武装斗争，在奥雷斯山区建立了第一个根据地，六年来的阿尔及利亚民族解放战争取得了巨大的成就，这支军队已经由最初的三千人壮大成为今天的十三万正规军。阿尔及利亚民族解放军打击了八十万有着现代化装备的法国殖民军队，在整个阿尔及利亚领土作战，动员了每个阿尔及利亚人民，现在除了一些大城市外，阿尔及利亚民族解放军在六个战区控制了广大的阿尔及利亚领土。他说，在阿尔及利亚领土上已经广泛地建立起了政治、军事统一的民主政权，它动员和团结了全国的人民群众，使殖民主义者行政机构陷于瘫痪。他强调指出，民族解放军的领导已经加强了，今年年初成立的总参谋部在全国范围内统一了军队的领导。
    他说，六年来的阿尔及利亚民族解放战争的形势一天天向前发展，阿尔及利亚军队经过卡比利、科尔洛、奥德尼等十几个重要战役，已经取得丰富的武装斗争经验。他说，现阶段阿尔及利亚的武装力量主要采取游击战，在全国建立了许多据点，分散敌人兵力，同时，在条件许可时集中优势兵力进行运动战，消灭敌人有生力量。他说，阿尔及利亚民族解放战争的战略、战术同中国过去的民族解放战争相似，主要采取游击战，并逐渐由游击战转为运动战。他说，法国殖民军过去采取包围战术，现在又实行大规模的“扫荡战”，企图孤立阿尔及利亚民族解放军，把民族解放军和人民隔离开来，但是法帝国主义是注定要失败的。他说，阿尔及利亚的人民军队有着高度的觉悟，有着不可战胜的信念。同时，目前的形势越来越有利于阿尔及利亚革命战争的发展。
    他说，阿尔及利亚民族解放战争胜利的原因是由于这个战争是正义的战争，一百三十年来，阿尔及利亚人民从来没有停止过打击侵略者，从来没有向法帝国主义屈服，阿尔及利亚军民是一致的，军队来自人民，得到人民全力的支持。阿尔及利亚战争是正义的战争，所以它得到全世界人民的支持。
    这位军事负责人说，阿尔及利亚武装斗争的目的是推翻殖民主义的统治，建立一个民主的共和国。他说，阿尔及利亚人民和民族解放军为这一目的将进行不懈的斗争。
