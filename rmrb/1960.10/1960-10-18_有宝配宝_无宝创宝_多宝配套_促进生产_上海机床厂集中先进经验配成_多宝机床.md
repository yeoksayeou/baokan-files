Shanghai Machine Tool Plant Concentrates Advanced Experience to Assemble "Multiple Treasure Machine Tools"

(Our report) According to the "Liberation Daily", in recent months, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant has systematically organized and reviewed the technological revolution projects from the first half of the year, mobilizing the masses to vigorously promote the "Multiple Treasure Combination" movement. By integrating advanced experiences, they have significantly improved the level of "four modernizations" and production efficiency, driving the increase production and practice economy movement. The output in September increased by 35.9% compared to August.

In early July, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant Party Committee, following the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, reviewed the production and technological revolution situation in the first half of the year. They found that although several thousand technological revolution projects had been carried out, the actual utilization rate was not high, and the effectiveness had not been fully realized. To solve this problem and further promote the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, leading cadres quickly changed their style and went to workshops and teams to investigate the situation, identify problems, and find solutions. After delving into the Batch Two Group of the Second Workshop, they found that this group had a very good method for promoting advanced experience. They concentrated the advanced experiences of each member of the group and used them in combination. Each machine tool regularly used three to six advanced experiences and advanced cutting tools and fixtures, with some using as many as twenty-two. The workers happily called them "Multiple Treasure Machine Tools." Precisely because the "Multiple Treasure Combination" was well implemented, the production of this group has been outstanding since July. Leading cadres carefully summarized their experience, believing that this approach was both a natural result of the in-depth development of the technological revolution movement and a direction for further promoting the technological revolution movement. They decided to first promote their experience in the Second Workshop, calling on all workers in the workshop to carry out the "Multiple Treasure Machine Tool" movement, contributing and seeking treasures, and combining them into complete sets. While vigorously mobilizing the masses, they also exhibited all the successful innovation projects and advanced cutting tools and fixtures from the first half of the year, such as multi-piece processing, multi-tool processing, and mold making. They organized employees to comprehensively organize, review, and evaluate them using the "three-in-one" method, requiring everyone to "grasp the big ones and not miss the small ones," combining big treasures and small treasures to form complete sets and strings. Furthermore, they launched competitions between groups, machine tools, and individuals. Machine tools that simultaneously used "three treasures" or more were considered "Multiple Treasure Machine Tools" and were decorated with red silk to attract attention. By adopting this method of launching a large-scale mass movement, immediate results were achieved: within three days, the number of "Multiple Treasure Machine Tools" using three or more treasures in the entire Second Workshop rapidly increased from over ten in Batch Two Group to over fifty, and production efficiency immediately increased by more than 20%.

After gaining experience through key experiments in the Second Workshop, leading cadres immediately organized a major summary, exchange, and promotion throughout the factory. At the same time, they continued to vigorously promote individual and group competitions, launching a massive mass movement throughout the factory to contribute, seek, use, and send treasures, striving for complete sets of treasures. Not only were the "treasures" of oneself, one's group, one's workshop, and one's factory used in combination, but advanced experiences from other factories and regions were also actively absorbed. As a result, many "treasures" that were originally shelved were quickly matched into complete sets and exerted tremendous power in production. Some advanced experiences were promoted to all machine tools in the factory in just one week. Currently, in addition to 40% of ordinary machine tools in cold processing becoming "Multiple Treasure Machine Tools," "Multiple Treasure Cupolas," "Multiple Treasure Iron Melting Furnaces," and "Multiple Treasure Gas Furnaces" have also appeared on the hot processing lines. According to statistics, 76% of the furnaces have become "Multiple Treasure Furnaces." With the development of the "Multiple Treasure Combination" movement, labor productivity has greatly increased, the number of people achieving the output of several has increased by 50%, and production has increased substantially month after month.

    上海机床厂集中先进经验配成“多宝机床”
    本报讯　据解放日报消息　上海机床厂最近几个月来，有领导、有计划、有目的地整理、审查了今年上半年的技术革命项目，发动群众大搞“多宝配套”运动，将先进经验配套成龙，大大提高了“四化”程度和生产效率，推动了增产节约运动，9月份产量比8月份提高35.9％。
    今年7月初，上海机床厂党委根据市委指示，检查了上半年的生产和技术革命情况，发现今年上半年虽然搞了几千项技术革命项目，但实际使用率并不高，效用没有充分发挥。为了解决这个问题，进一步开展技术革新和技术革命运动，领导干部迅速改变作风，到车间、小组，摸情况，摸问题，摸办法。在深入第二车间成批二组以后，发现这个小组推广先进经验的办法很好。他们将全组每个人的先进经验集中起来配套使用每台机床都经常使用三种到六种先进经验和先进刀具夹具，最多的有二十二种，工人高兴地称之为“多宝机床”。正因为“多宝配套”搞得好，自7月份以来，这个小组的生产也非常出色。领导干部认真总结了他们的经验，认为这种做法既是技术革命运动深入发展的必然结果，又是进一步开展技术革命运动的方向，决定首先在二车间推广他们的经验，号召全车间工人开展“多宝机床”运动，献宝觅宝，配套成龙。在大力发动群众的同时，又将上半年试验成功的多件加工、多刀加工、造模等等革新项目和先进刀具夹具，全部展览出来，采用三结合的办法，组织职工全面加以整理、审查和鉴定，要求大家“抓住大的，不漏小的”，把大宝、小宝结合起来，使之成套成串。并且在组与组、机台与机台、人与人之间开展竞赛，凡是同时使用“三宝”以上的机床，就算“多宝机床”，在机身上披红结采，以引起注意。采取了这种大搞群众运动的办法，成效立见：三天之内，整个第二车间使用三宝以上的“多宝机床”，从成批二组的十多台迅速发展到五十多台，生产效率马上提高了20％以上。
    经过第二车间重点试验取得经验以后，领导干部立即在全厂组织大总结、大交流、大推广。同时继续大搞个人与个人，组与组之间的评比竞赛活动，在全厂掀起了一个声势浩大的献宝、觅宝、用宝、送宝，力求宝宝配套的群众运动。不仅将本人、本组、本车间、本厂的“宝”拿来配套，而且积极吸收别的厂、别的地区的先进经验。这样一来，很多原来搁置不用的“宝贝”，都迅速地搭配成套，在生产上发挥出巨大的威力；有些先进经验在短短一个星期的时间里，便被推广到全厂所有的机床上。现在，除了在冷加工方面有40％的普通机床已经成为“多宝机床”以外，在热加工线上也出现了“多宝冲天炉”“多宝化铁炉”“多宝煤气炉”，据统计，有76％的炉子成了“多宝炉”。随着“多宝配套”运动的发展，劳动生产率大大提高，实现一顶几的人数增加了50％，生产也连月大幅度增长。
