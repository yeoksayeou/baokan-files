Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 10th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," published an editorial today, calling on the Japanese people to be vigilant against the dangerous plan of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to strengthen Japan's nuclear armament based on the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

"Akahata" said that the Director General of Japan's "Defense Agency," Masumi Esaki, revealed on the 7th that he planned to put the army and navy "under the unified command of the U.S. military and to accelerate preparations for the nuclear armament of the Japanese military." Masumi Esaki also emphasized that Japan "will bring ‘Nike-Hercules’ nuclear missiles into Japan as soon as possible."

"Akahata" said that according to the new "Security Treaty," the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are establishing aggressive military institutions; at the same time, the Ikeda Cabinet is trying to divert public attention from military issues to so-called "economic prosperity." "Akahata" emphasized that the Ikeda Cabinet is expanding troops that violate the constitution.

"Akahata" pointed out that in order to crush this cunning conspiracy of the reactionary forces, the "Security Treaty" issue must be brought to a prominent position in the general election.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 10th: The Fukuoka Prefectural People's Joint Struggle Conference for the Abolition of the "Security Treaty" held an activist meeting on the 8th, deciding to fully launch a struggle to oppose the "Self-Defense Forces" moving to Ashiya Town in the prefecture.

Ashiya Town used to have a U.S. Air Force base, but due to residents' opposition, the U.S. military began moving to Okinawa this spring and plans to transfer the base to the Japanese military.

The activist meeting unanimously agreed that the struggle against the base is a core part of the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, and the struggle against the Ashiya base must continue to be emphasized in the future.

The meeting decided to hold a prefectural people's congress on the 15th as part of the 23rd National Unified Action against the "Security Treaty." The meeting also decided to launch a movement against the "Self-Defense Forces" and develop it into a struggle against the revival of Japanese militarism.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 10th: Under the resolute demands of farmers in Yamato City, the Japan Procurement Agency has been forced to agree to resettle farmers living near the U.S. Atsugi Air Force Base.

Due to the noise of U.S. military jets taking off and landing, 178 farming households in Yamato City, unable to live in peace, have long demanded that the Procurement Agency find land for them and provide compensation so that they can collectively relocate elsewhere. Their protest against the pain and insult given by the U.S. military base has been supported by workers and people from all walks of life. The Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly also passed a resolution in June this year, demanding that the Japanese government solve the noise problem at the Atsugi base.

In the face of the increasingly high tide of opposition to U.S. military bases in Japan among the Japanese people, in order to quell widespread anti-American sentiment, it is said that the Procurement Agency has decided to relocate 39 farming households by the end of this year, and all 178 farming households will be relocated within two or three years.

However, the Speaker of the Yamato City Council, Nagamasa Futami, believes that relocating farmers is not a fundamental solution to eliminate the noise of U.S. jets.

    日共“赤旗报”发表社论
    号召日本人民反对核武装
    福冈县共同斗争会议反对日本军队进驻县内
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日共机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日本人民警惕美日反动派根据新日美“安全条约”来加强日本核武装的危险计划。
    “赤旗报”说，日本“防卫厅”长官江崎真澄在7日透露，他计划把陆军和海军“置于美国军队的统一指挥之下，并加紧准备日本军队的核武装”。江崎真澄还强调说，日本“将尽快把‘奈克—赫尔克里士’式核导弹运入日本。”
    “赤旗报”说，根据新的“安全条约”，美日反动派正在建立侵略性的军事机构；同时，池田内阁正在努力使公众的注意力从军事问题上转移到所谓“经济繁荣”方面去。“赤旗报”强调指出，池田内阁正在扩充违背宪法的军队。
    “赤旗报”指出：要粉碎反动势力的这种狡猾的阴谋，必须在大选中把“安全条约”问题提到显著的地位。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本福冈县民争取废除“安全条约”共同斗争会议8日举行积极分子会议，决定全力展开斗争，反对“自卫队”迁到县内的芦屋町驻扎。
    芦屋町曾经设有美国空军基地，但由于居民的反对，美军从今年春季开始迁到冲绳岛，并计划把基地移交给日本军队。
    积极分子会议一致认为，反对基地的斗争是反对日美军事同盟斗争的核心部分，今后必须继续着重展开反对芦屋基地的斗争。
    会议决定，在15日将举行县民代表大会作为第二十三次反对“安全条约”全国统一行动的一部分。会议并且决定，将要展开反对“自卫队”的运动，并使它发展成为反对复活日本军国主义的斗争。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：在大和市农民的坚决要求下，日本调达厅已经被迫同意重新安顿居住在美国厚木空军基地附近的农民。
    由于美军喷气飞机的起飞和降落的骚音，无法安居的大和市一百七十八家农户，长期以来就要求调达厅替他们找土地和给予补偿，让他们集体迁移到别处去。他们对美国军事基地所给予的痛苦和侮辱的抗议得到工人和各界人民的支持。神奈川县议会在今年6月也通过了一项决议，要求日本政府解决厚木基地的骚音问题。
    在日本人民日益高涨的反对在日本的美国军事基地的情况下，为了平息广泛的反美情绪，据说调达厅已经决定在今年年内迁移三十九家农户，全部一百七十八家农户将在二三年内迁完。
    但是，大和市议会议长二见长昌认为迁移农户不是消除美国喷气式飞机骚音的根本办法。
