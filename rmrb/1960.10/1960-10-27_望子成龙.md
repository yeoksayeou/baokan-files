    "Hoping One's Son Will Become a Dragon"
    Liu Ming
    Legend has it that there once was a "child prodigy" who could write brilliant prose and was exceedingly clever. One year, his father carried him on his back to the capital to take the imperial examination. Seeing this scene, the examiner immediately used the phrase "riding father as a horse" to challenge him to create a matching couplet. Without hesitation, the "child prodigy" blurted out: "Hoping one's son will become a dragon."

    "Hoping one's son will become a dragon," if it refers to parents' deep love for their children, hoping they will become upright and cultured people, then it is, of course, beyond reproach. Which parent in the world doesn't love their children? Which one doesn't hope their children will become "dragons"? The problem lies in what kind of "dragon" they become. Different classes and different societies, with different worldviews, have different ideals and standards for "dragon."

    What this "child prodigy's" father earnestly hoped for his son was nothing more than success in the imperial examination, a high official position, and bringing honor to his ancestors. This was the feudal society's "dragon." All exploiting classes hope that their children will inherit their fathers' businesses, continue to ride on the backs of the people, act like tyrants, and exploit others. This is their ideal "dragon."

    Times have changed, and the "dragon" has also changed. Now, we hope that our next generation will become socialist "dragons." We want to cultivate our next generation to become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, to become true successors to the cause of communism.

    On October 12th, Xinhua News Agency dispatched a news item from Taiyuan, introducing the deeds of many veteran cadres in Baode County, Shanxi Province, who educated their children to settle down and engage in agricultural work. They are the role models for parents today. For example, Yang Fuguo, director of the supply and marketing cooperative of Jiajiamao Commune, his son Yang Bingzhi was once uneasy about agricultural labor, thinking that agricultural labor was hard and "the future was not bright." After Yang Fuguo discovered this, he repeatedly educated his son to correctly understand the issue of the future, pointing out that the needs of the Party and the people are our future; leaving the needs of the Party and the people, unwilling to engage in arduous labor, nothing will have a future. Yang Fuguo also told his son the story of the arduous struggle during the War of Resistance Against Japan, telling him, "You are truly unaware of how fortunate you are today." Under his father's earnest teachings, Yang Bingzhi overcame his wrong ideas, actively worked, and was elected as the production team leader. There is also Zhang HuaiShu, the son of Zhang Manxi, the Party Secretary of the Balougou Commune, who saw that his father ate, lived, worked, and consulted with the commune members and thought, "My father has participated in the revolution for more than 20 years, and he still loves agricultural labor so much, I should participate in agricultural production even better." Therefore, after graduating from middle school, he resolutely participated in agricultural production, and took the lead in labor everywhere.

    Under the guidance of their parents, one hundred and sixty children of cadres in Baode County have carried forward the fine tradition of hard struggle and made contributions on the agricultural front. This is truly "like father, like son."

    I suggest that everyone read this news (Editor's note: This news can be found on page 4 of the October 13th People's Daily), and parents should read it several times more, because these veteran cadres are their role models. Why? First, their goal of cultivating their children is correct, requiring their children to become socialist "dragons" that meet the needs of the Party and the people. Second, their method of educating their children is correct, not letting their children live in comfort, but putting them into labor, into struggle, and into difficult environments to temper them, so as to cultivate a strong revolutionary will and a communist spirit of not fearing hardship and never giving up. Third, they often conduct Party education, communist education, labor education, and revolutionary tradition education for their children, and educate and influence their children with their own revolutionary actions and revolutionary temperament.

    To educate one's children well, one of the important conditions is to lead by example. For example, if parents require their children to settle down in agricultural production, they must first have a full understanding of the significance of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and have concrete manifestations in their actions. Otherwise, they will not be able to carry out correct education for their children; even if they can talk about the principles of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, they will not be able to achieve the desired effect because of their inconsistent words and deeds. The reason why many veteran cadres in Baode County can have such a great influence on young people is because they have set a brilliant example for the next generation with their heroic behavior. The same is true for other aspects of education.

    To cultivate the next generation into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, we must usually conduct labor education for our children, encourage and urge them to participate in some industrial and agricultural production and social public welfare labor within their capacity, and participate in daily housework, so that they can develop a habit of loving labor and cultivate their sense of honor in labor. However, in daily life, we also see some parents who are afraid that their children will suffer a little "hardship" or "tiredness," do not want their children to participate in labor, and even take care of their children's daily trivial matters, letting their children open their mouths for food and stretch out their hands for clothes. Some even refuse to talk to their children about the darkness of the old society and the suffering of the working people, and do not talk about the past arduous struggles, saying that it is to avoid leaving "dark shadows" on their children. Although these parents have "good" intentions, they are actually misleading their children. This kind of education only allows them to enjoy the warmth of the sun, but not to withstand the wind and rain, making them weak-willed and averse to labor. Some parents also emphasize that they are busy with work and let their children's education go unchecked. They one-sidedly emphasize school education and social education, looking for excuses for their lack of concern for their children's education. Of course, school and social education are undoubtedly extremely important. With the deepening of the socialist revolution and the development of the socialist construction cause, this education is further playing its huge role. However, despite this, parents still have an important educational responsibility for their children and should regard educating their children as their regular task, because this is also a concrete manifestation of being responsible for the socialist construction cause.

    The current young people will take over the revolutionary torch from their fathers and brothers and become successors to the cause of communism. To cultivate these successors with the communist spirit and communist methods is a glorious political task, and everyone should cultivate their children into socialist giant "dragons."

### “望子成龙”

    “望子成龙”
    刘明
    相传从前有个“神童”，出口成章，聪敏过人。某年，其父驮他上京赶考，考官看到这般情景，即用“骑父作马”四字，令他对对子，这位“神童”不假思索，脱口而出曰：“望子成龙”。
    “望子成龙”，如果是指父母爱子心切，希望他成为一个正直的有教养的人，那当然未可厚非。天下做父母的那个不爱子女？那个不希望自己的子女成“龙”？问题在于成为怎样的“龙”。不同的阶级，不同的社会，有着不同世界观的人，对于“龙”却有不同的理想和标准。
    这位“神童”的父亲，殷切期望于儿子的，无非是金榜题名，高官厚禄，光宗耀祖，这是封建社会的“龙”。一切剥削阶级，都希望自己的子女继承父业，继续骑在人民头上，作威作福，剥削别人。这就是他们理想中的“龙”。
    时代变了，“龙”也变了。现在，我们希望自己的下一代成为社会主义的“龙”。我们要把下一代培养成为有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者，成为真正的共产主义接班人。
    10月12日新华通讯社自太原发出一条新闻，介绍了山西省保德县许多老干部教育子女安心务农的事迹，正是今天为人父母者的表率。例如贾家峁公社供销合作社主任杨富国，他的儿子杨秉智一度不安心农业劳动，认为农业劳动苦，“前途不大”。杨富国发现后，三番五次地教育他的儿子要正确认识前途问题，指出党和人民的需要，就是我们的前途；离开党和人民的需要，不愿意从事艰苦的劳动，干什么也不会有前途。杨富国还给儿子讲抗日战争时期艰苦斗争的故事，告诉他“你今天真是身在福中不知福”。杨秉智在父亲的谆谆教诲下，克服了错误思想，积极劳动，被选为生产队长。还有扒楼沟公社党委书记张满喜的儿子张怀树，看到自己的父亲和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，就想：“我父亲参加革命二十多年了，还那样热爱农业劳动，我更应该好好地参加农业生产。”因此他在中学毕业后，就毅然参加了农业生产，并且在劳动中处处带头。
    保德县一百六十名在乡干部子女，他们在父母的教导下，发扬了艰苦奋斗的优良传统，在农业战线上作出了贡献。这真是“老子英雄儿好汉”。
    我建议大家都来读一读这条新闻（编者注：这条新闻见10月13日人民日报第四版），做父母的更应该多读几遍，因为这些老干部正是自己的榜样。为什么呢？第一，他们培养子女的目标正确，要求子女成为符合党和人民需要的社会主义的“龙”。第二，他们教育子女的方法正确，不让子女养尊处优，而把他们放到劳动中去、放到斗争中去、放到艰苦的环境中去锻炼，如此才能培养出坚强的革命意志，不畏艰险、百折不回的共产主义品质。第三，他们经常对子女进行党的教育、共产主义教育、劳动教育和革命传统教育，并以自己的革命行动和革命气质去教育和影响自己的子女。
    做父母的要教育好自己的子女，其中重要的一个条件，就是要以身作则。譬如：家长要求子女安心农业生产，自己首先就要对大办农业大办粮食的意义有充分的认识，并在行动上有具体的表现。否则，就不能对子女进行正确的教育；即使能讲一些大办农业大办粮食的道理，也会因为自己的言行不一，而不能收到应有的效果。保德县的许多老干部能够在青年中起这样大的影响，就是由于他们以自己的英雄行为，给下一代树了光辉的榜样。其他方面的教育也莫不如此。
    我们要培养下一代成为有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者，平时就必须向子女进行劳动教育，鼓励并督促他们参加一些力所能及的工农业生产及社会公益劳动，参加日常的家务劳动，使他们养成爱劳动的习惯，培养他们的劳动光荣感。可是，在日常生活中，我们还看到另外一些做父母的，唯恐子女吃点“苦”受点“累”，不希望自己的子女参加劳动，连孩子的日常生活琐事，都要自己包办，让孩子衣来伸手，饭来张口。有的甚至不愿向孩子谈谈旧社会的黑暗和劳动人民所受的痛苦，不谈过去的艰苦斗争，说是为了不在孩子身上留下“阴暗的影子”。这些做父母的用心虽“好”，但实际上却贻误了孩子。这样的教育，使他们只能享受阳光的温暖，不能经受风吹雨打，意志薄弱，恶劳好逸。也有些父母强调工作忙，对于子女的教育放任自流。他们片面强调学校教育和社会教育，为自己不关心子女的教育找寻借口。当然，学校和社会的教育无疑是极为重要的，随着社会主义革命的深入和社会主义建设事业的发展，这种教育正在进一步发挥它的巨大作用。但是，尽管如此，做父母的对自己的子女仍负有重要的教育责任，应该把教育子女作为自己的经常任务，因为这也是对社会主义建设事业负责的一种具体表现。
    现在的青、少年，将从他们父兄的手里接过革命的火炬，成为共产主义的接班人。用共产主义的精神和共产主义的方法培养这些接班人，是一项光荣的政治任务，大家都应把自己的子女培养成为社会主义的巨“龙”。　〔原载《解放日报》〕
