    Qin Town Digs for Fertilizer Sources
    Wheat planting is about to begin in the Xibao Management District of the Hongshan Commune in Qin Town.
    Qin Zhenzhong, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, came to the management district and immediately inquired about how many fields had been plowed three times, how many had been plowed twice, and how much base fertilizer had been prepared. When he learned that only six dan of base fertilizer could be applied per mu, he explained the principle that wheat needs to be rich from the start, and that base fertilizer cannot be lacking. He decided to find sources of fertilizer from every corner.
    At that time, Qin Zhenzhong and the cadres of the management district personally took up shovels and ran to several livestock sheds and manure pits, watching and digging, while also visiting several old farmers to learn about past methods of fertilizer accumulation. As a result, they found seven methods of accumulating fertilizer, including cleaning livestock sheds, manure pits, collecting scattered fertilizers, and pressing fast-acting green manure. Immediately, they concentrated labor and animal power to launch a concentrated effort to accumulate and transport fertilizer. In two days, they accumulated a total of 13,050 dan of fertilizer, increasing the average application of base fertilizer per mu of wheat field from six dan to nine dan.

    秦镇中挖肥源
    洪善公社西堡管理区种麦就要开始了。
    公社党委第一书记秦镇中来到了管理区，进门来他就了解麦地耕了三犁的有多少？耕了二犁的有多少？底肥准备了多少？当他知道每亩地只能施六担底肥时，就向大家说明了麦子要胎里富，底肥不能少的道理，决定要从各个角落里找肥源。
    当时，秦镇中就和管理区的干部一起，拿起铁锹亲自跑了几个畜厩、粪坑，边看边挖，同时，访问了几名老农，了解过去积肥的办法，结果找到了清理畜厩、粪坑、搜集零星肥料、压速效绿肥等七项积肥的办法。随即集中劳力、畜力突击积肥、运肥，两天时间，共积肥一万三千零五十担，每亩麦田由平均施底肥六担增加到九担。
