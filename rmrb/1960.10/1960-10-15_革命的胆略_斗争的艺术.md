Revolutionary Courage, Art of Struggle
    Lin Xu

    "Plucking Teeth from the Tiger's Mouth" is a vivid revolutionary memoir. Here, it writes about the prelude to the Liaoshen Campaign in Northeast China during the Third Domestic Revolutionary War.

    Heroic achievements, historical witness, every chapter shines with the victorious glory of our great era, shining with the glory of Mao Zedong Thought that guides our era to victory. Reviewing these immortal poems, how profound an education we will receive from them, and what tremendous spiritual strength we will draw!

    Chairman Mao's "Operational Policy on the Liaoshen Campaign" (see Volume IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," page 1337) is an immortal Marxist-Leninist military document, a brilliant campaign plan. "Plucking Teeth from the Tiger's Mouth" records a vivid battle reality that embodies Chairman Mao's military thought. One is the intention of the operation, and the other is the result of the battle. The subjective and objective are so consistent, almost without any difference. Chairman Mao brilliantly pointed out: "Your central attention must be focused on the Jinzhou operation, striving to capture the city as quickly as possible. Even if all other goals are not achieved, as long as Jinzhou is captured, you will have the initiative and it will be a great victory." Facts fully confirmed this great scientific prediction of Chairman Mao. Taking Jinzhou cut off the enemy's retreat and created a situation of "closing the door to beat the dog" and "catching turtles in a jar," which could further eliminate the enemy completely in the Northeast region. Chairman Mao further pointed out: Attacking Jinzhou would inevitably cause the enemy in Shenyang to come to Jinzhou's aid, which would create a good opportunity for us to encircle and annihilate the enemy reinforcements. "If the Shenyang enemy reinforcements advance to the north of the Daling River area, precisely when you have already captured Jinzhou, making it possible for you to transfer forces to encircle and annihilate the enemy, then it is also possible to annihilate the Shenyang enemy reinforcements." Possibility ultimately became reality. The Liao Yaoxiang Corps of the Shenyang enemy reinforcements was completely annihilated under our encirclement. In the Liaoshen Campaign, our army annihilated 470,000 enemy troops and liberated the entire Northeast. The result of the Liaoshen Campaign brought about a fundamental change in the entire war situation. The People's Liberation Army not only surpassed the enemy in quality long ago, but also surpassed the enemy in quantity at this time; it was not only superior in tactics, but also superior in the entire strategy at this time. From the battle of "Plucking Teeth from the Tiger's Mouth," we saw the victory of the Liaoshen Campaign; from the victory of the Liaoshen Campaign, we saw the victory of the national liberation war. The cause of the people, the cause of revolution, is thus advancing from victory to victory under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    The reactionaries always underestimate the power of the revolution. They believed that Jinzhou had more than 100,000 armed forces stationed there; that the People's Liberation Army's attack on Jinzhou would create a too long battle line; and that if Jinzhou was attacked, the enemy in Changchun and Shenyang could come to reinforce it at any time. They believed that the People's Liberation Army would never dare to pluck teeth from the tiger's mouth, and even if they dared, they might not be able to do it. When the Jinzhou Campaign started, Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly flew to the Northeast to command personally. However, he made a wrong move and laid ambushes everywhere. Even if Chiang Kai-shek commanded personally, he could not save his own decline. Historical facts always educate us in this way: the newborn force will inevitably defeat the decadent force; the progressive force will inevitably defeat the reactionary force; the revolutionary force will inevitably defeat the counter-revolutionary force. Although the revolutionary force is relatively weak at the beginning and is temporarily in a disadvantageous position, it will eventually defeat the superficially powerful enemy that is temporarily in an advantageous position. This is the law of historical development, which cannot be shifted by anyone's will. Proletarian revolutionaries have always believed in this inevitable trend of historical development, and can master the laws of historical development, defeat any enemy, and strive for the victory of the revolution. As early as the initial stage of the Liberation War, Chairman Mao, based on the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint of class analysis, made the brilliant conclusion that "all reactionaries are paper tigers." Chairman Mao pointed out: "The superiority of Chiang Kai-shek's military strength is only a temporary phenomenon, only a temporarily functioning factor; the assistance of American imperialism is also only a temporarily functioning factor; the anti-popular nature of Chiang Kai-shek's war and the support of the people are constantly functioning factors; and in this regard, the People's Liberation Army has the advantage." (Volume IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," page 1246). These incisive analyses and brilliant conclusions of Chairman Mao armed the revolutionary people and the revolutionary army of our country ideologically, and inspired and strengthened the national people's confidence in defeating the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is precisely under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant revolutionary thought that the people's army has always possessed fearless revolutionary courage and is full of revolutionary confidence in victory. Facing a powerful enemy, dare to fight against it; facing a difficult environment, dare to strive for victory. Therefore, things that the enemy thinks cannot be done, we can do; things that the enemy thinks we dare not do, we dare to do. "Disregarding the two enemies in Changchun and Shenyang," going deep into the enemy's rear and inserting a steel knife into the enemy's heart, this kind of divine military action, this kind of fearless revolutionary courage and confidence in victory, from the perspective of the reactionaries' underestimation of the revolutionary forces, cannot be understood and can never be understood. The result can only be: our enemies are completely defeated!

    Under the command of Comrade Lin Biao, the Northeast People's Liberation Army perfectly embodied Chairman Mao's thought of despising the enemy strategically and valuing the enemy tactically. In the Liaoshen Campaign, the People's Liberation Army faced 44 divisions of the enemy army armed to the teeth, a force that could not be underestimated. However, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's military thought, the revolutionary army not only dared to fight the enemy and dared to bravely seize victory, but also was good at fighting and good at striving for victory. While despising the enemy on the whole and strategically, it also adopted a cautious attitude and paid attention to the art of struggle in every local campaign and in every specific combat action.

    There are two passages in this memoir that describe:
       "On the 24th, just before dawn, I was awakened by the 'report' of the Chief of the Secretarial Section, Qiao Zun.
  He handed me a telegram from the column headquarters. The leaders of the 9th Column conveyed in the telegram the battle order of Commander Lin. … At the end of the telegram, the leaders exhorted us: 'This
  action is related to whether Commander Lin's entire operational intention can be realized, and the task is very important and arduous. Commander Lin
  will directly command, and you should immediately communicate with the headquarters, and report the battle plan and battle
  situation to the leaders at any time.'"
      "We thoroughly studied the various problems that might be encountered in the battle and the solutions.
  Finally, it was decided that in order for the cadres to understand the situation in time and command the troops, cadres at all levels would command two to three levels ahead when
  penetrating forward. Regiment cadres to companies, battalion cadres to
  platoons … I personally took charge of the vanguard company to open a breakthrough for the entire division."

    You see, from the command of the Field Army Headquarters, to the command of the Column Headquarters, to the command of the Division Headquarters, along with courage and boldness, how meticulous, how specific, how in-depth it is!

    Comrade Lin Biao and the Northeast People's Liberation Army under his leadership also perfectly embodied Chairman Mao's military thought of "concentrating superior forces and annihilating the enemy one by one" in various battles, using two, three, four, or even five or six times the enemy's forces to surround the enemy in each battle, striving for complete annihilation and not allowing anyone to escape. In the Liaoshen Campaign, the Northeast People's Liberation Army concentrated twelve main columns and one artillery column, together with local armed forces, a total of fifty-three divisions, more than 700,000 people. Among them, six columns, one artillery column, and one tank battalion besieged Jinzhou. This is exactly what Chairman Mao told us: to fight annihilating battles. To fight annihilating battles, it is necessary to be good at using manpower and material resources, "using good steel on the blade," concentrating the main force to solve the main contradictions. For the enemy, it is better to injure one finger than to injure ten fingers, first break one finger and then break ten fingers; isolate the enemy and then gather and annihilate them. This art of struggle enables the people's army to transform tactical advantages into strategic advantages, transform local advantages into overall advantages, and ensure that the revolutionary war is in an active position and the people's forces are always invincible.

    Look at the Battle of Jinzhou, under the superior force and vigorous fighting spirit of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, even a tiger's mouth must have its teeth plucked, and they were indeed plucked.

    The enemy is aware of this method of operation of the People's Liberation Army. Not only aware, but also familiar with it. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the US imperialist military personnel in China had racked their brains to study these military methods of the People's Liberation Army and tried to find ways to deal with them. However, all dying struggles could not save their fate. Where is the mystery? The mystery lies in the fact that Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist military thought and strategy and tactics are based on people's war, and no anti-people army can use or deal with our strategy and tactics. "On the basis of people's war, on the basis of the unity of the army and the people, the unity of commanders and fighters, and the disintegration of the enemy army, the People's Liberation Army has established its powerful revolutionary political work, which is a major factor in our victory over the enemy." "In this way, the troops will be of one mind, everyone will think of ways, everyone will contribute their strength, not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome the difficulties of material conditions, and have the courage and wisdom to bravely kill the enemy. Such an army will be invincible in the world." (Volume IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," pages 1248 and 1292)

    The thought and art of struggle of strategically despising the enemy and tactically valuing the enemy are based on the dialectical materialism and historical materialism world view. Chairman Mao taught us: "The rule of imperialism in the world and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group in China has rotted and has no future. We have reason to despise them, and we have the assurance and confidence to defeat all enemies of the Chinese people at home and abroad." Since it is a reactionary, it always wants to eat people, and the closer the enemy gets to death, the more frantic, the more cruel, and the more it wants to eat people. Therefore, "in every local area, in every specific struggle problem (whether it is military, political, economic, or ideological struggle), we must not despise the enemy. On the contrary, we should value the enemy and concentrate our efforts to fight, so as to win victory." (Volume IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," page 1267)

    The same is true for dealing with difficulties. The difficulties encountered in the revolutionary cause are the difficulties in progress, the difficulties in development, and it inherently possesses the power to overcome the difficulties. Therefore, we have reason to despise difficulties from the overall and essential point of view. However, one difficulty after another does hinder our path forward. A bell will not ring if it is not struck, and dust will not go away by itself if it is not swept away. If difficulties are not solved one by one specifically, they will not be effective. Therefore, in specific struggles and specific work, we must value difficulties and solve problems effectively.

    Under the education of Mao Zedong Thought and through long-term revolutionary war training, the people of our country not only possess revolutionary courage, but also master the art of struggle. The people of our country are not only able to defeat all domestic and foreign reactionaries and win the victory of the people's revolutionary war, but also able to overcome any difficulties and achieve great victories in all socialist and communist construction undertakings.

    革命的胆略　斗争的艺术
    林旭
    《虎口拔牙》是一篇生动的革命回忆录。这里，写的是第三次国内革命战争时期东北辽沈战役的一个序幕。
    英雄的业绩，历史的见证，每一篇每一章都闪耀着我们这个伟大时代胜利的光辉，闪耀着引导我们时代胜利前进的毛泽东思想的光辉。重温这些不朽的诗篇，我们将从中受到多么深刻的教育，吸取到多么巨大的精神力量！
    毛主席的《关于辽沈战役的作战方针》（见《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一三三七页），是一篇不朽的马克思列宁主义的军事文献，是一个英明的战役计划。《虎口拔牙》记录了体现毛主席军事思想的一次生动的战斗实况。一个是作战的意图，一个是战斗的结果。主客观如此一致，几乎不差分毫。毛主席英明地指出：“你们的中心注意力必须放在锦州作战方面，求得尽可能迅速地攻克该城。即使一切其他目的都未达到，只要攻克了锦州，你们就有了主动权，就是一个伟大的胜利。”事实完全证实了毛主席这个伟大的科学预见。打下锦州，切断了敌人的退路，造成关门打狗、瓮中捉鳖之势，就能够进一步把敌人全部消灭在东北地区。毛主席进一步指出：攻打锦州，沈阳之敌必然出来援锦，这又造成我们围歼援敌之良机。“如果沈阳援敌进至大凌河以北地区，恰当你们业已攻克锦州、使你们有可能转移兵力将该敌加以包围的话，那就也可能歼灭沈阳援敌。”可能，又终于变成了现实。沈阳援敌廖耀湘兵团在我围歼之下，全军复没。辽沈战役这一仗，我军歼灭了敌人四十七万人，解放了东北全境。辽沈战役的结果，使得整个战争局势发生了根本的变化。人民解放军不仅在质量上早已超过了敌人，而且这时在数量上也超过了敌人；不仅在战术上处于优势，而且这时在整个战略上也处于优势了。从《虎口拔牙》的战斗，我们看到了辽沈战役的胜利；从辽沈战役的胜利，我们看到了全国解放战争的胜利。人民的事业，革命的事业，就是这样在毛泽东思想的指导下从胜利走向胜利。
    反动派对革命的力量，总是估计不足的。它们以为锦州有十余万武装力量驻守；人民解放军攻打锦州，战线太长了；而如果打锦州，长、沈之敌又可以随时出来增援。它们以为人民解放军决不敢虎口拔牙，即使拔也未必拔得动。及至锦州战役打响了，蒋介石慌忙飞到东北亲自指挥。然而，棋差一着，伏手伏脚。蒋介石亲自指挥也罢，已无法挽救自己的颓局。历史的事实总是这样教育我们的：新生的力量必然战胜腐朽的力量；进步的力量必然战胜反动的力量；革命的力量必然战胜反革命的力量。虽然革命的力量开始时比较弱小，暂时处于劣势地位，但它终究会战胜表面上强大的、暂时处于优势地位的敌人。这是历史的发展规律，是不以任何人的意志为转移的。无产阶级革命者从来都相信这种历史发展的必然趋势，并且能够掌握历史发展的规律，战胜任何敌人，争取革命的胜利。还在解放战争的初期毛主席根据马克思列宁主义的阶级分析观点，作出了“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断。毛主席指出：“蒋介石军事力量的优势，只是暂时的现象，只是临时起作用的因素；美国帝国主义的援助，也只是临时起作用的因素；蒋介石战争的反人民的性质、人心的向背，则是经常起作用的因素；而在这方面，人民解放军则占着优势。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一二四六页）。毛主席这些精辟的分析和英明的论断，从思想上武装了我国革命的人民和革命的军队，鼓舞和坚定了全国人民打垮国民党反动派的胜利信心。正是在毛主席这种英明的革命思想指导下，所以人民的军队在任何时候都具有无畏的革命胆略，充满必胜的革命信心。面对强大的敌人，敢于同它斗争；面对艰苦的环境，敢于去争取胜利。因此，敌人认为不能的事情，我们能；敌人认为不敢的事情，我们敢。“置长春、沈阳两敌于不顾”，深入敌人后方，把钢刀插在敌人心脏里，这种神威的军事行动，这种无畏的革命胆略和必胜的革命信心，从反动派低估革命力量的逻辑着眼，是不会理解的，也是永远无法理解的。其结果只能是：我们的敌人彻底地输了！
    东北人民解放军在林彪同志的指挥下，完善地体现了毛主席关于在战略上藐视敌人与在战术上重视敌人的思想。辽沈战役中，人民解放军面对着武装到牙齿的四十四个师的敌军，这个力量是不可小看的。但是，在毛主席军事思想的英明指导下，革命的军队不仅敢于和敌人斗争，敢于英勇地夺取胜利，而还善于进行斗争，善于争取胜利。在整体上、战略上轻视敌人，而且在每一个局部的战役上，在每一次具体作战行动上，都采取了谨慎的态度，讲究斗争的艺术。
    这篇回忆录中有这样两节描写：
       “24日天快破晓，我被机要科长乔遵一声‘报告’惊醒了。
  他交给我纵队司令部来的一份电报。九纵首长在电报上传达了林
  总的战斗命令。……在电报的末了，首长向我们叮嘱说：‘此次
  行动关系着林总整个作战意图能否实现，任务十分重大艰巨。林
  总将直接指挥，你们应立即与总部构通联络，把战斗计划和战斗
  情况随时向首长报告。’”
      “我们周密地研究了战斗中可能遇到的各种问题和解决的办
  法。最后决定为使干部能及时了解情况，指挥部队，各级干部在
  向前穿插时，提前两级到三级指挥。团的干部到连，营的干部到
  排……我亲自掌握前卫连，为全师打开突破口。”
    你看，从野战军司令部的指挥、到纵队司令部的指挥、到师的司令部的指挥，与勇敢大胆的同时，又是何等细致，何等具体，何等深入！
    林彪同志及其领导下的东北人民解放军，在各次战斗中还完善地体现了毛主席关于“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”的军事思想，在每一战斗中使用两倍、三倍、四倍，甚至是五倍、六倍于敌人的兵力包围敌人，力求全歼，不使漏网。辽沈战役中，东北人民解放军集中了主力十二个纵队和一个炮兵纵队，连同地方武装共五十三个师，七十余万人。其中有六个纵队、一个炮兵纵队和一个坦克营围攻锦州。这正是毛主席告诉我们的：打歼灭战。要打歼灭战，就要善于使用人力、物力，“把好钢用在刀刃上”，集中主要力量解决主要矛盾。对于敌人伤其十指不如断其一指，先断其一指，后断其十指；把敌人分散孤立起来，聚而歼之。这种斗争的艺术，就使得人民的军队能够把战术上的优势转化为战略上的优势，把局部的优势转化为整体的优势，能够保证革命的战争处于主动地位，人民的力量永远立于不败之地。
    请看锦州一战，在东北人民解放军优势兵力和旺盛的斗志之下，即使是虎口也要拔牙，而且果然拔掉了。
    人民解放军这种作战方法敌人是了解的。不仅了解，而且熟知。蒋介石匪帮和美帝国主义在华的军事人员曾经挖空心思地研究人民解放军的这些军事方法，并且企图寻找对付的办法。但是，所有的垂死挣扎都挽救不了他们的命运。奥妙在哪里？奥妙就在于：毛主席的这种马克思列宁主义的军事思想和战略战术建立在人民战争的基础上，任何反人民的军队都不能利用、不能对付我们的战略战术。“在人民战争的基础上，在军队和人民团结一致、指挥员和战斗员团结一致以及瓦解敌军等项原则的基础上，人民解放军建立了自己的强有力的革命的政治工作，这是我们战胜敌人的重大因素。”“这样就使部队万众一心，大家想办法，大家出力量，不怕牺牲，克服物质条件的困难，群威群胆，英勇杀敌。这样的军队将是无敌于天下的”。（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一二四八、一二九二页）
    关于在战略上藐视敌人和在战术上重视敌人的思想和斗争艺术，是建立在辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观的基础之上的。毛主席教导我们说：“全世界帝国主义和中国蒋介石反动集团的统治，已经腐烂，没有前途。我们有理由轻视它们，我们有把握、有信心战胜中国人民的一切内外敌人。”既然是反动派，它总是要吃人的，而且越是敌人接近死亡的时候，也就越疯狂，越残酷，越是要吃人，因此“在每一个局部上，在每一个具体斗争问题上（不论是军事的、政治的、经济的或思想的斗争），却又决不可轻视敌人，相反，应当重视敌人，集中全力作战，方能取得胜利。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一二六七页）
    对待困难也是一样。革命事业所遇到的困难，是前进中的困难、发展中的困难，它的本身就完全具备着克服困难的力量。因此，我们有理由从整体上、本质上藐视困难。然而，一个个困难又确实阻挠我们前进的去路。钟不敲不响，尘灰不扫不会自己走掉。一个个困难，不一个个加以具体解决，也就不能奏效。因此，在具体斗争上、具体工作中，又要重视困难，切实地解决问题。
    我国人民在毛泽东思想的教育下，经过长期革命战争的锻炼，不但具备了革命的胆略，而且掌握了斗争的艺术。我国人民不仅能够打败一切国内外反动派，取得人民革命战争的胜利，而且能够在社会主义、共产主义的一切建设事业中，战胜任何困难，取得巨大的胜利。
