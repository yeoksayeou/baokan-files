Morning in the Mountains
Tan Liping

Have you ever been to those lush green mountains? Have you ever been to those cloud-wreathed mountain peaks? Ah, friends! If you come to our place, you will surely exclaim from the bottom of your heart in surprise, the mountain area is beautiful, magnificent. However, when you can stand on the wind-swept mountaintop before dawn, overlooking the sunrise over the mountains, with thousands of rays of light shining through the light gauze-like clouds, its magnificent colors will make you feel as if you are in a mythical fairyland, marveling endlessly.

Mountains, how many people have expressed deep feelings for them, writing poems and essays for them. The ancients described: "Spring mountains are charming and smiling, summer mountains are verdant and dripping; autumn mountains are bright and clean, winter mountains are bleak and sleeping." However, we revolutionaries do not have such a leisurely mood to appreciate the myriad charms of the mountains. Those who have fought guerrilla warfare have another kind of lofty feeling for the mountains, regarding them as a symbol of strong will, an embodiment of revolution. The mountains are the birthplace of our revolution; the mountains are the forging ground where our revolutionary army has been tempered. In the pen of our leader Chairman Mao, the mountains that "pierce the blue sky with their unspent blades" become so majestic and magnificent, standing tall and upright like giants.

Today, as I climb the lush green mountains of Yong'an County, Fujian, and greet the sunrise, joyfully inhaling the cool and fragrant breeze, I cannot help but feel refreshed and happy. This is not only because I can see the sunrise in the morning and its fascinating and magnificent colors, but also because I can see a vivid picture of socialist construction in the mountains under the shining light of the sunrise.

Looking down at the foot of the mountain, the slopes and fields are covered with a layer of green carpet. This is the rice planted on the newly developed terraced fields since the establishment of the people's commune. The rice seedlings sway in the breeze, just like the green waves surging in an endless ocean. The streams in the rice fields, in contrast, become like scattered dots in the green waves, like golden fish jumping in the sunlight in this green sea. As I watched, I thought of the days when this remote and poor rural area ate sweet potatoes and wild vegetables, and I seemed to smell the fragrance of rice flowers.

The day's work has begun, and the early risers are already engaged in labor in different positions. The sound of cars, "Dudu," drew my attention to the winding road, which meandered for dozens of miles, climbing from the mountainside to the top of the mountain, and from the foot of the mountain to the peaks again. Sometimes, it is like a white ribbon wrapping around the mountains layer by layer; sometimes it is like a waterfall pouring down from the top of the mountain, carrying various ores, steel bars, cement and construction equipment, cars running back and forth on this mountainous road, where there are cliffs on one side and precipices on the other, full of dangers; sometimes it flies as lightly and freely as a swallow, gliding down the sloping gradient; sometimes, it is like a clumsy old ox, panting, slowly climbing the hillside. Although this road is so difficult to travel, the traffic is heavy and endless.

Yes, in this deep mountain and dense forest, a large-scale modern cement factory is being born. Of course, it seems like a miracle. You may ask, a few years ago, no, can we say just the year before last, wasn't this a place with sparse population and frequent wild animals? That's right! When we first came here in 1958, everyone held a sickle in one hand and a hunting gun in the other. The sickle was specially used to cut through thorns and weeds and open up a road for people to walk on. The hunting gun was specially used to deal with jackals, wolves and tigers. In just one or two years, the mountain area has changed. Under the light of the Party's General Line, a modern factory is being born, and the people's commune has changed the face of this place with a spring thunder. Since the Party called for vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, many cutting-edge science and technology, and the creation and invention of many mechanized and automated tools, are like flowers blooming in the spring breeze, blossoming and bearing fruit on the construction site. When you want to say to them: "Comrades, you have worked hard!" They will answer in unison: "Working for socialism!" Or someone will say: "Tired? We have never thought of this word!" Indeed, everyone does not know what tiredness is, everyone is attracted by a great belief, that is, the socialist today and the communist tomorrow. On the mountain, there is a martyr's tomb, which was left over from the Anti-Japanese War. The name of the martyr is not written here, but we know that their ideals are being realized in the hands of the people under the leadership of our Party. We don’t need to hide the hardship, in fact. Although the living conditions in the mountains are much better than in the past, they are still much worse than the life in big cities. However, we will never have half a complaint for this. On the contrary, we warmly cheer for the construction of the motherland. When we hear that the ten major projects in Beijing have been completed, everyone writes the most enthusiastic poems to praise them. Although we live in sheds that leak in the wind and rain, and although there is not even an ordinary bicycle on our mountain land, what does it matter, we will never wait for happiness, nor will we ask nature for gifts, we must demand from nature and build our homeland with labor. All the achievements of Beijing and the voices of the motherland vigorously encourage us to accelerate our progress.

The road is made by people. We are breaking through the waist-high weeds and stepping over the dirty mud on this road that no one has traveled before, opening up a new road, facing the rosy clouds and the sunrise. One day, we will build all the mountainous areas of the motherland as beautiful as paradise.

Indeed, the mountainous area is leaping forward. Under our continuous months of assault, we have finally led the rails into this cloud-filled mountainous area by opening mountains and building roads. The first train loaded with machine tool equipment and construction materials drove into our mountainous area.

This is a miracle! Someone shouted like this. Yes, this is indeed a miracle.

Facing the sunrise, standing on the high mountain, looking at this happy picture, I could not help but laugh heartily and full of infinite joy.

    山区的早晨
    谭立平
    你到过那翠绿的深山吗？你到过那云雾缠绕的山巅吗？啊，朋友！如果你来到我们这个地方，你一定会惊异地从内心呼出，山区是美丽的，绮艳的。然而当你能在破晓前站在晨风吹拂的山顶上，俯视山那边透过轻纱帐幕般的云雾，射出万道霞光的日出时，它色彩的瑰丽，使你犹如处身在神话般的仙境中，惊叹不绝。
    山，多少人对它流露过深厚的感情，为它吟诗作赋，古人形容：“春山艳冶而如笑，夏山苍翠而如滴；秋山明净而如洗，冬山惨淡而如睡。”不过对于我们革命者却没有这样悠闲的心情去欣赏山的千娇百态，打过游击战争的人，对山有着另一种崇高的感觉，把山当作坚强意志的象征，革命的化身。山，是我们革命的发源地；山，是我们革命军队千锤百炼的熔冶场。在我们领袖毛主席的笔下，“刺破青天锷未残”的群山，就变得如此雄伟壮观，顶天立地，像巨人一般。
    今日，当我登上福建永安县的郁郁苍苍的山峰，迎着日出愉快地饱吸着凉爽芬香的清风，使我不禁心旷神怡。这不仅因为能看到早晨的日出和它那迷人绮艳的色彩，而且是因为能在日出的光芒照耀下，看到了山区一幅鲜艳的社会主义建设的图画。
    俯首向山脚了望，满坡遍野，就像复上了一层绿油油的地毯，这就是自从成立了人民公社后，在新开发的梯田上种的水稻，稻苗在微风中摆动，正像一片茫茫无际的海洋所掀起的绿波在荡漾。稻田中的溪水，在绿波中反而变得点点滴滴，犹如这片绿海中闪着金光的鱼儿在阳光下跳跃。我望着望着，想起过去这片穷乡僻壤吃地瓜野菜的日子，仿佛现在闻到了稻花的香味。
    一天的工作开始了，早起的人们已经在不同的岗位上从事劳动。嘟，嘟的汽车声，将我的视线吸引到那条迤逦曲折的公路上，它蜿蜒数十里，从山腰爬到了山顶，从山脚又爬上了山峰。有时候，它就像一条白带将群山层层围住；有时候它又像一泻千里的瀑布，从山顶直泻下来，载着各种矿石、钢筋、水泥和建设器材的汽车，在这一边是悬崖、一边是绝壁，险象环生的山区公路上来回奔驰；有时候它像燕子一样轻松自如地飞翔，顺着倾斜的坡度一滑而下；有时候，它又像一只笨重的老牛，喘着气，慢慢地爬着山坡。这条公路虽然是这样难行，但是车水马龙，络绎不绝。
    是的，在我们这深山密林中，一座大型的现代化水泥厂正在诞生。当然，说起来仿佛是奇迹一般。你也许要问，几年以前，不，可以说就是前年吧，这里难道不是人烟稀少，野兽出没的地方吗？一点不错！1958年我们刚到这里来的时候，每个人手里拿着一把镰刀，一枝猎枪。镰刀是专门用来斩除荆棘荒草，开辟出一条人走的道路来的。猎枪是专门用来对付豺狼虎豹的。仅仅过了一两年，山区就变了样。在党的总路线照耀下，一座现代化的工厂正在诞生，人民公社一声春雷，使这里的面貌变了样。自从党号召大搞技术革新，大闹技术革命之后，多少尖端的科学技术，多少机械化自动化工具的创造和发明，都正像在春风中怒放的花朵一样，在工地上开花结果。当你要向他们说：“同志们，辛苦了！”他们会异口同声地回答：“为社会主义劳动！”或者有人说：“累？我们从来也没想到过这个字！”的确是这样，大家都不知道什么是累，大家都被一个伟大的信念所吸引了，那就是社会主义的今天，共产主义的明天。山上，有着一座烈士墓，这是抗日战争时留下的，这里并没有写下烈士的名字，但是我们知道，他们的理想，正在我们党领导下的人民手中实现。苦，其实我们也不必隐瞒，山区的生活条件，虽然比起过去是强了许多倍，但是比起大城市的生活来说，还是要差得多的，但是我们决不为这个而有半句怨言，相反，我们为祖国的建设热烈地欢呼，当我们听到北京十大工程竣工，我们每人都写出最热情的诗篇来赞颂。虽然我们住的是在狂风骤雨中会漏雨的工棚，虽然在我们的山地上连辆普通的自行车也没有，但是这又何妨，我们决不等待幸福，也决不向自然求取恩赐，我们要向自然索取，要用劳动把自己的家园兴建。北京的一切成就，祖国的一点声音，都有力地鼓舞我们更加快自己的前进步伐。
    路，是人走出来的。我们正在这条前人所没有走过的道路上，斩断齐腰的野草，踏过污秽的泥泞，开辟出一条崭新的，迎着霞光和日出的道路。总有一天，我们会将祖国的各个山区，建设得和天堂一样的美丽。
    真的，山区正在跃进。在我们连续几个月的突击下，开山筑路，终于将铁轨引进了这云雾弥漫的山区中，第一列载满机床设备和建设器材的火车开进了我们的山区。
    这是奇迹！有人这样高呼。是的，这的确是奇迹。
    我迎着日出，我站在高山上，我望着这一幅幸福的图景，我不自禁地爽朗地充满无限愉快地笑了。
