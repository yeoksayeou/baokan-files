"Waste Cotton" Disappears
Worker Xing Yun

Our metrology lab is a unit with high cotton consumption. Any day, various workshops send over many parts, and these parts need to be wiped with cotton soaked in alcohol before measurement, otherwise, quality cannot be guaranteed. The dozen or so instruments in the room are highly precise and also need to be wiped and oiled daily. Because of this, a large pile of waste cotton with iron filings accumulates under the windowsill on the west side every week. We never cared about this waste cotton; we just let it pile up, and when the time came, the cleaner would move it into the trash can.

However, for the past two weeks, the waste cotton under the windowsill has not been accumulating. It's not that we're not throwing it there, but it disappears as soon as we throw it. We always thought that the cleaning comrade was just working harder, so we asked the cleaner. But our guess was wrong. "I thought you weren't throwing it away anymore!" was the cleaner's reply.

What's going on? We all felt a little strange.

"Let's all pay attention and see who's picking it up," said team leader Jiang Lin.

So, we "paid attention." Sure enough, one morning, just as Little Wang was about to throw out the waste cotton, he saw a girl squatting there picking up cotton, her face not looking too good, as if she was angry with someone. At the time, Little Wang didn't say anything; he just threw out the waste cotton in his hand and that was that.

But that afternoon, something happened.

After lunch, when we came to work, a big-character poster appeared on the white-painted gate:

To the Responsible Comrade of the Central Metrology Lab:

Your wastefulness is terrible! As a worker, I strongly protest against this serious behavior of not cherishing state property!

Should cotton that is only stained with iron filings and oil be sentenced to "death"? Why are you squandering "white gold" like this? Have you considered how much labor it takes for this cotton to reach your hands? I found you throwing it away, so I picked it up. It's been more than half a month, but you're still throwing it away! Throwing! Throwing! Don't you feel any pain? Please don't forget: we are the working class!

That's all the opinion I have, it may be a little excessive, but I think it should be excessive. Please criticize any inaccuracies.

Outside Electrical Worker Zhao Chunmei

After reading this big-character poster, we all gasped! Wow! This girl is so fierce! But her opinion is right. After she raised this point, I also felt that our practice was too wrong. At this time, the team leader hurriedly called a group meeting and invited Secretary Xu from the Party branch. Just as we were about to sit down for the meeting, a girl wearing a work cap, with a screwdriver and wire cutters stuck in her waist, knocked on the door and came in. Her dark eyes were round and bright, and she was carrying a large package. As soon as she came in, she put the heavy package on the floor and said to us:

"Comrades, this cotton is yours, a total of ten catties. I have processed it and it can be used as usual. Now I'm giving it back to you. - Please don't throw it away again in the future!" After she said these words, she turned around and flew out. Team leader Jiang was about to go out and call her back, but Secretary Xu stopped him:

"Come back, don't call her back, it's working hours now!" Saying that, he untied the package, and a pile of fine, white cotton fluffed open. Secretary Xu then said gravely:

"Everyone sees how much we are wasting! But we didn't notice this problem in the past! If it weren't for Comrade Zhao Chunmei posting a big-character poster and using facts to prove that 'waste cotton' can be renewed, we don't know how long our waste would have continued! Comrades, remember this lesson, and in the future, we should always pay attention to eliminating all wasteful phenomena in our work!" After a pause, he added: "Remember what Comrade Zhao Chunmei said, 'Please don't forget: we are the working class'!"

Hearing this, we all took a deep breath, feeling that we were too wrong, and a guilty expression appeared on Team leader Jiang's face. He quickly went over and used tongs to pick up the "waste cotton" thrown under the windowsill before the meal and put it in an empty drawer.

### “废棉”不见了

    “废棉”不见了
    工人　星云
    我们计量室是个耗棉量很大的单位。随便哪一天，各个车间总要送来不少零件，这些零件，在测量之前，都需要用棉花蘸上酒精擦洗，不然就无法保证质量。室内的十几台仪器，精度极高，也要每天擦洗、敷油。由于这种情况，所以每每一周下来，靠西壁的窗台下，就积下了一大堆带有铁屑的废棉。对于这些废棉，我们是从来不去过问的，只是随它堆着，到时候便由清扫员把它搬进垃圾箱去了。
    可是，最近两周来，那窗台下的废棉积聚不起来了。倒不是我们不往那边扔，而是扔了就不见了。我们总以为是清扫员同志手脚变得更勤了呢，便去问了问清扫员。哪知我们的估计错了。“我还当你们不往外边扔了呢！”这是清扫员的回答。
    怎么回事呢？我们都感到有点奇怪。
    “咱大家用心注意一下，看到底是谁来捡去的。”组长蒋林说。
    于是，我们便“用心注意”了。果然，一天上午，小王刚要把废棉扔出去，就看见一个姑娘蹲在那里捡棉花，面色不大好看，像是跟谁生了气似的。当时小王也没吱声，只是把手里的废棉扔了出去也就算了。
    然而就在那天下午，事情发生了。
    吃过中饭，我们来上班时，白漆大门上出现了一张大字报：
    中心计量室负责同志：
    你们的浪费现象太可怕了！对于这种不爱惜国家财产的严重行为，我以一个工人的身份，向你们提出强硬抗议！
    仅仅沾上些铁屑和油污的棉花就该判决“死刑”了吗？你们为什么要如此挥霍“白金”呢？你们考虑过没有：这些棉花经过多少人的劳动才到了你们的手里？我发现你们往外扔，便把它们拣回去。半个多月下来了，可你们还是往外扔！扔！扔！难道你们就一点不心疼吗？请别忘记：咱们是工人阶级啊！
    意见就提这些，可能有些过火，但是我认为过火些还是应该的。不对的地方，请批评。
    外路电工　赵春梅
    看完这张大字报，我们都倒抽了一口气！好家伙！这姑娘多厉害哟！然而她的意见是对的。经她这一提，我也感到我们的做法太不应该了。这时组长急得立即召开小组会议，并把党支部许书记请了来。我们刚要坐下来开会，一位戴着工作帽、腰间插着螺丝刀和克丝钳的姑娘，敲门进来了。她的一双黑眼睛滴溜滚圆，手里提着个大包裹。她一进来，就把那沉甸甸的包裹放在地板上，然后冲着我们说：
    “同志，这些棉花是你们的，一共十斤，我已把它们处理过了，可照常使用。现在仍旧把它给你们。——以后请别再往外边扔了！”她说完这些话，便一扭身飞出去了。蒋组长刚要出去喊她回来，却被许书记叫住了：
    “回来吧，别去喊她了，现在是上班时间！”说着，他解开了包裹，一大堆又细又白的棉花松松地弹开来了。许书记接着沉重地说：
    “大家看，我们的浪费多大！可我们在过去就没有发现这个问题！要不是这位赵春梅同志贴出张大字报，又用事实来证明‘废棉’可以复新，我们的浪费还不知要延长到什么时候呢！同志们，记取这次教训，以后在工作中应随时注意杜绝一切浪费现象！”停了停又补充道：“记住赵春梅同志的话吧，‘请别忘记：咱们是工人阶级’！”
    我们听了，都深深地呼了口气，觉得自己错得太不应该了，蒋组长的脸上露出了负疚的表情，他连忙过去用夹子把饭前扔在窗台下的“废棉”捡了起来，放到一只空抽斗里。
