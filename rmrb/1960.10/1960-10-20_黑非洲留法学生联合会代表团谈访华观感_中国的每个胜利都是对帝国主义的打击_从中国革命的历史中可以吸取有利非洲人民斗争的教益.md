The delegation of the Federation of Black African Students in France published their impressions of their visit to China in the "China Youth Daily" on October 13th. The delegation stated that the friendship between the great Chinese people and the African people is long-standing, and this friendship is built on an unshakable foundation of opposing our common enemy—imperialism headed by the United States.

When discussing the experience of the Chinese revolution, the delegation said: "From the history of the Chinese revolution, we can draw many lessons that are beneficial to our struggle. First of all, the proletariat is the only thoroughly revolutionary class, but it is not enough to only understand this truth. The proletariat must also form an alliance with all active forces, especially the large number of peasants, on the condition that they accept the leadership of the proletariat, in order to make the revolution successful. This experience is particularly important for colonial and semi-colonial countries."

Another magic weapon of the Chinese revolution—armed struggle—is also of great significance. It enabled the establishment and development of strategic and tactical thinking in revolutionary war. It has transcended the scope of one place and country and has international significance. The encirclement of cities from the countryside, protracted war, strategically despising the enemy, and correctly estimating the enemy's strength in every link of the campaign, these experiences provide revolutionary knowledge for all people in the anti-imperialist struggle. When armed struggles are rising on the African continent, in Algeria, in Cameroon, and are brewing in many places, we cannot but give it the importance it deserves. The Chinese Long March and the Chinese people's war against American and Japanese imperialism and domestic reactionaries for more than 30 years have become our example and strengthened our confidence in the victory of the struggle.

When talking about the great achievements of China's socialist construction, the delegation said, "The more we look back on the history of the Chinese revolution with great admiration, the more surprised and excited we are by the achievements made since China's liberation."

The birth of the Chinese People's Commune and the brilliant achievements made in the Great Leap Forward shattered the slanderous rumors of the imperialists. Every victory of the Chinese people is a serious blow to imperialism and a great achievement for the entire socialist camp.

The delegation concluded by saying that African youth and the vast majority of African people warmly cheer for all the achievements China has made, and congratulate the Chinese people on their greater and greater achievements in the cause of socialist construction.

    黑非洲留法学生联合会代表团谈访华观感
    中国的每个胜利都是对帝国主义的打击
    从中国革命的历史中可以吸取有利非洲人民斗争的教益
    黑非洲留法学生联合会代表团在10月13日“中国青年报”发表了访华观感。代表团说，伟大的中国人民和非洲人民之间的友谊是悠久的，这种友谊是建筑在反对我们共同的敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义的不可动摇的基础上的。
    代表团在谈到中国革命的经验时说：“从中国革命的历史中，我们可以吸取许多有利于我们斗争的教益。首先，就是无产阶级是唯一彻底的革命阶级这一点，但是只了解这条真理还不够。无产阶级还必须和一切活动的力量，特别是人数众多的农民，在它们接受无产阶级领导的条件下结成联盟，才能使革命取得成功。这个经验对殖民地、半殖民地国家特别重要。”
    中国革命的另一件法宝——武装斗争也具有重大意义。它使革命战争的战略、战术思想得以树立和发挥。它已超越一个地方和国家的范围而具有国际意义了。农村包围城市，持久战，在战略上藐视敌人，在战役的每个环节又要正确估计敌人的力量，这些经验为一切在反帝斗争中的人民提供了革命知识。当武装斗争正在非洲大陆、在阿尔及利亚、在喀麦隆掀起，并在很多地方酝酿着的时候，我们不能不把它提到应有的重要地位。中国的长征以及三十多年来中国人民反对美、日帝国主义和国内反动派的战争，成为我们的榜样，坚定了我们斗争的胜利信心。
    代表团在谈到中国社会主义建设的伟大成就时说，“我们越是以极其钦佩的心情回顾中国革命的历史，中国解放以来所取得的成就就越使我们感到惊异和振奋。”
    中国人民公社的诞生和大跃进中所取得的辉煌成就粉碎了帝国主义者的诬蔑谰言。中国人民的每一个胜利，都是对帝国主义的一次严重的打击，都是整个社会主义阵营的一个巨大成就。
    代表团最后说，非洲青年和绝大多数的非洲人民热烈地为中国所取得的一切成就而欢呼，并祝贺中国人民在社会主义建设事业中取得越来越大的成就。
