    Be a Loyal Servant of the People
    Wei Shuqin
    In a socialist society, everyone has a certain social duty. As long as this duty is beneficial to the Party, to the cause of the proletariat, and to the people, then the work they do is serving the people. As for the different types of work, that is just a different division of labor in society. The quality of a salesperson's service depends on the quality of their labor viewpoint, which is whether or not they have a communist attitude towards labor, whether they are serving the interests of the broad masses of people, and whether they are considering the interests of the broad masses and the socialist cause in everything they do. Now, let's talk about these two issues separately.
    First, the issue of labor viewpoint in the service process. A salesperson standing behind a counter is different from a worker standing next to a machine. A salesperson standing behind a counter can receive hundreds of customers a day, or they can receive only a few dozen, or even just a few, and still finish their day's work, because the number of customers a salesperson serves cannot be set as a quota like it can for workers in a factory. Precisely because of this, to be a good salesperson, one must have a strong and conscious labor viewpoint, and see one's work as a noble and glorious responsibility.
    Second, labor should benefit the people. In the old society, shop assistants belonged to the capitalists; but today, the stores belong to us. Therefore, first and foremost, we must establish the idea of treating the store as our home. As the masters of the country, we must first establish the idea of doing everything for the country, treating the store's affairs as our own, and putting the interests of the Party above our personal interests, enduring hardship before enjoying comfort. We must be like what Chairman Mao told us: "Be a person who is noble, a person who is pure, a person who is moral, a person who is free from vulgar tastes, and a person who is beneficial to the people." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume II, page 654)

    做个忠实的人民勤务员
    魏淑琴
    在社会主义社会中，每一个人都有一定的社会职务，只要这个职务对党、对无产阶级事业、对人民有利，那他所从事的工作就是为人民服务的工作。至于工种不同，那是社会分工不同。售货员服务的好坏，决定于售货员劳动观点的好坏，那就是有没有共产主义的劳动态度问题，是不是为广大人民利益服务，处处都为广大人民打算，为社会主义事业打算的问题。现在就分别谈谈这两个问题。
    第一、在服务过程中的劳动观点问题。售货员站在柜台前，不同于工人站在机器旁边。售货员站在柜台前，一天可以接待几百名顾客，也可以接待几十名，甚至仅仅接待几名顾客也可结束这一天的工作，因为售货员接待的顾客多少并不能像工厂里的工人一样规定出定额。正因为这样，作一个好售货员，就必须要有坚强自觉的劳动观点，把自己的工作看成一种高尚的光荣的职责。
    第二、劳动要为人民造福。在旧社会，店员是为资本家所有；而今天，商店则是我们自己的，那首先就必须要树立起一个以商店为家的思想。作为国家主人翁，首先就必须树立起一切为国家，把商店的事看成是自己的事，把党的利益摆在个人利益之上，吃苦在前，享受在后。要像毛主席告诉我们那样“作一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”（《毛泽东选集》二卷六五四页）
