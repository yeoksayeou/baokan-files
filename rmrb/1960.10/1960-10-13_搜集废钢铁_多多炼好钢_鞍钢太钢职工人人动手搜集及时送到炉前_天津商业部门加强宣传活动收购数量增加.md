Collect Scrap Steel, Produce More Good Steel
Anshan Iron and Steel and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Workers Mobilize to Collect and Deliver in Time to the Furnace Front
Tianjin Commercial Departments Strengthen Publicity Campaigns, Increasing Acquisition Volume
    (Our Report) Anshan Iron and Steel Company's vast number of workers, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, have launched a mass campaign to collect scrap steel. According to statistics, the entire company recovered more than 62,940 tons of scrap steel from September 1st to 26th, powerfully supporting increased steel production.
    Under the slogans "Don't Let an Inch of Steel Go to Waste, Don't Discard an Inch of Iron, Pick Clean the Ground, Exhaust the Underground," workers in all factories and mines in the company set aside time to collect, clean up, and dig up scrap steel everywhere. Workers at the sintering plant used their spare time, adopting a "make every second count" approach, and recovered 1,620 tons of scrap steel from September 1st to 20th. The Seamless Steel Tube Plant formed seven amateur scrap steel recovery youth shock brigades. In the "digging for treasure" competition, they were full of energy and quickly collected more than 1,000 tons of scrap steel and iron. The director of the East Anshan Mine's mining workshop and more than 50 workers formed a mountain-searching team, and on September 19th held a major mountain search, recovering more than 120 tons of scrap steel in just one day. The Transportation Department's workers, without affecting normal transportation, set aside some train cars every day to transport scrap steel.
    In order to strengthen leadership over this work, the Party Committee secretaries or factory/mine directors of each factory and mine personally took command, went deep into the front lines, and fought alongside the workers. They also organized workers to carry out competitions between shifts and individuals, including scrap steel collection as part of the evaluation competition, promptly commending the advanced and establishing model workers, powerfully promoting the in-depth development of the movement. (Our Report) The vast number of workers at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company are enthusiastically carrying out a movement to collect scrap steel.
    In order to maximize the effectiveness of this movement, the company established a headquarters headed by the manager, and each factory and branch company established command groups. The vast number of workers actively joined the movement. They used methods such as digging,撈ing (retrieving things from water), and picking up to quickly concentrate a large amount of scrap steel and rapidly put it into production. In addition to collecting scattered scrap steel on the ground, the workers of the Installation Company went deep underground and into sewage pits to dig and撈. The planning section of the processing plant organized a shock brigade of more than 30 people, who dug out more than 70 tons of scrap steel from underground in just over a day. The workers of the Fourth Company also launched a "three mores" competition to see who could pick up more, transport more, and put more into the warehouse. Cart driver Li Zhenxi picked up more than two tons of scrap steel in two days. Each unit transported the scrap steel they picked up to the front of the open hearth furnace, blast furnace, converter, and electric furnace with gongs and drums, greatly boosting the morale of the furnace front workers and powerfully promoting the growth of steel production.
    (Our Report) Employees of various waste products management units in Tianjin are actively purchasing scrap steel to support the production of various steel mills. According to statistics, from January to the first ten days of September this year, the city's purchased scrap steel increased by more than 40% compared with the same period last year.
    The various scrap product purchasing units in Tianjin have always paid attention to purchasing scrap steel. Since the launch of the campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel, the employees of scrap product companies from the city to the various districts have taken even more active action, formulated concrete action plans for purchasing scrap steel, and widely carried out various publicity activities to explain to the masses the important significance of supporting steel production, inspiring the masses to sell more scrap steel. The Nankai District Scrap Product Company also specifically organized a publicity team of 80 people, which went deep into factories, government offices, schools, and street residents to publicize and purchase simultaneously, with very good results.
    In order to facilitate the sale of scrap steel by the masses, each district has added purchasing points, established civil-run purchasing stations, and developed voluntary liaison recyclers in factories, government offices, schools, and among residents, greatly promoting purchasing work.
    Each district also actively organized transportation forces to quickly deliver the purchased scrap steel to various steel mills. The Heping District Scrap Product Company delivered 89 tons of scrap steel to the Tianjin Steel Plant No. 1 in eight days in late August.

    搜集废钢铁　多多炼好钢
    鞍钢太钢职工人人动手搜集及时送到炉前
    天津商业部门加强宣传活动收购数量增加
    本报讯　鞍钢广大职工在增产节约运动中，掀起了一个群众性的搜集废钢铁运动。据统计，全公司从9月1日至26日就回收了六万二千九百四十多吨废钢铁，有力地支援了炼钢增产。
    这个公司各厂矿职工在“寸钢不让、寸铁不丢，拣光地上，挖尽地下”的口号下，抽出时间各处搜集、清理、挖掘废钢铁。烧结总厂职工利用工余时间，采取见缝插针的办法，从9月1日至20日就回收了一千六百二十吨废钢铁。无缝钢管厂组成了七个业余回收废钢铁青年突击队。在“挖宝”竞赛中，他们干劲冲天，很快就搜集了一千多吨废钢、废铁。东鞍山矿采矿车间主任和工人五十多人组成了一个搜山队，在9月19日举行了一次大搜山活动，仅一天就回收了一百二十余吨废钢铁。运输部的职工在不影响正常运输的情况下，每天都要抽出一部分火车皮运废钢铁。
    为了加强对这项工作的领导，各厂矿党委书记或厂矿长都亲自挂帅，深入第一线和工人一起奋战，并组织职工展开了班与班、人与人的竞赛，把搜集废钢铁列为评比竞赛内容之一，及时表扬先进，大树标兵，有力地推动了运动的深入开展。本报讯　太原钢铁公司广大职工热烈开展搜集废钢铁的运动。
    为了使这一运动收到最大的效果，公司以经理为首，成立了指挥部，各厂、各分公司都成立了指挥组，广大职工都积极投入了这一运动。他们通过挖、捞、拣等办法，使大量的废钢铁很快集中起来，迅速地投入了生产。安装公司职工除了将地面分散的废钢铁搜集起来以外，还深入到地下和污水坑中去挖、捞。加工厂计划科组织了一个三十多人的突击队，一天多的时间，就从地下挖出了废钢铁七十多吨。四公司职工还开展了看谁拣得多、运得多、入库多的“三多”竞赛，马车工李珍喜两天就拣了废钢铁两吨多。各单位都把自己拣到的废钢铁敲锣打鼓地送到了平炉、高炉、转炉和电炉炉前，极大地鼓舞了炉前工人的干劲，有力地促进了钢铁生产的增长。
    本报讯　天津市各废品经营单位的职工，积极收购废钢铁，支援各钢厂生产。据统计，从今年1月至9月上旬，全市收购的废钢铁比去年同期增长了40％以上。
    天津市各废品收购单位一向注意收购废钢铁，开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动以来，从市到各区的废品公司的职工更积极行动起来，制订了具体的收购废钢铁的行动计划，并且广泛开展各种宣传活动，向群众说明支援钢铁生产的重要意义，启发群众更多地出售废钢铁。南开区废品公司还专门组织了一支八十人的宣传队伍，深入到工厂、机关、学校和街道居民当中，边宣传，边收购，效果很好。
    为了便利群众出售废钢铁，各区都增设了收购点，建立了民办代购站，在工厂、机关、学校和居民中发展义务联络回收员，大大地促进了收购工作。
    各区还积极组织运输力量，把收购来的废钢铁迅速送到各钢厂。和平区废品公司在8月下旬的八天中就给天钢一厂送了八十九吨废钢铁。
