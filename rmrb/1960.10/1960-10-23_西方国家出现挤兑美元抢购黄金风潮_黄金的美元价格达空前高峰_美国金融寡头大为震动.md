Xinhua News Agency, October 21st: Due to deepening concerns that the U.S. fiscal and financial crisis will force a devaluation of the dollar, a wave of exchanging dollars and selling dollar stocks for gold has swept through almost the entire capitalist world's financial markets in recent days, driving the dollar price of gold to unprecedented highs in these markets.

This trend has been emerging in some Western European markets for several days and reached a climax on the London market yesterday. Yesterday, the price of gold on the London market rose to $40.6 per ounce, nearly $5 higher than the price at the start of the day. This is $5.6 higher than the official U.S. gold-dollar exchange rate ($35 per ounce).

Commenting on the situation, Associated Press economic commentator Dawson said, "The new wave of gold purchases in London and elsewhere involves the prestige of the dollar and doubts about the trend of the U.S. economy."

Prior to this, the rush to buy gold had been developing in financial markets in other capitalist countries in Western Europe. On October 19, the price of gold on the Paris financial market rose to 6,150 new francs per kilogram, the highest point since the franc's sharp devaluation in March 1952, an increase of more than 500 new francs per kilogram compared to previous prices. In Milan, Italy, the price of gold was 730 lira per centimeter on the morning of the 19th, but rose to 770 lira by noon, about 10% higher than the average gold price in recent years. In Frankfurt, West Germany, the price of gold per kilogram was 5,105 marks on the evening of the 18th, but rose to 5,500 marks on the 19th. In Switzerland, there had already been a large-scale gold rush a few days ago. In Canada, which is under the strictest U.S. economic control, a gold rush described by Western news agencies as "indescribable and unprecedented" also occurred in Toronto yesterday. Even in the United States, there was a gold rush. It is reported that the total amount of gold sold on the New York market yesterday reached more than $20 million. However, many people who wanted to get gold were not satisfied.

Associated Press economic commentator Dawson, referring to the rush to buy gold, pointed out that some Western European bankers hope to convert their dollar reserves into gold, and some believe that the dollar is no longer the strongest currency it once was. They insist that the U.S.'s balance of payments deficits and gold outflows over the past three years may force the dollar to depreciate.

This worldwide rush to buy gold has greatly shaken American financial giants. Major leaders of the New York banking community immediately met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson yesterday after receiving the news, demanding that the U.S. government take swift measures to stop the development of this trend. The U.S. Treasury Department then issued a statement yesterday in an attempt to stabilize sentiment, saying that maintaining the exchange rate of $35 per ounce of gold is "our unwavering position."

However, the Associated Press could not help but admit in a news report that "U.S. authorities are increasingly uneasy about the continued outflow of gold from the U.S. Treasury, a situation that makes the world unsure whether the dollar can maintain its value among world currencies." (See photo)

October 21, at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in the capital of the Union of South Africa, people are rushing to buy shares in gold companies. Brokers are pushing and shoving each other, shouting loudly in chaos.

### 西方国家出现挤兑美元抢购黄金风潮  黄金的美元价格达空前高峰  美国金融寡头大为震动

    西方国家出现挤兑美元抢购黄金风潮
    黄金的美元价格达空前高峰  美国金融寡头大为震动
    新华社21日讯　由于担心日益深刻化的美国财政金融危机将迫使美元贬值，最近几天里，一个挤兑美元、争相抛售美元股票和抢购黄金的浪潮，席卷了几乎整个资本主义世界金融市场，使得黄金的美元价格在这些市场上达到空前高峰。
    这一风潮几天来已经在西欧某些市场上出现，昨天在伦敦市场上发展到一个高潮。昨天，伦敦市场上每盎斯黄金的价格上涨到四十点六美元，比昨天开始时的价格上涨了将近五美元。这比美国官方规定的黄金与美元的比价（每盎斯三十五美元）高出了五点六美元。
    美联社经济评论员道逊在评论这种情况时说，“伦敦和其他地方抢购黄金的新风潮牵涉到美元的威信和对美国经济趋势的怀疑。”
    在这以前，这种抢购黄金的风潮在西欧其他资本主义国家金融市场上已经在发展。19日在巴黎金融市场上黄金价格上涨到每公斤六千一百五十新法郎，是1952年3月法郎比值暴跌以来的最高点，比这以前每公斤黄金价格上涨了五百新法郎以上。在意大利的米兰，19日上午每公分黄金价格还是七百三十里拉，到中午就涨到七百七十里拉，比几年来黄金平均价格上涨了10％左右。在西德的法兰克福，每公斤的黄金价格18日晚还是五千一百零五马克，到19日就涨到五千五百马克。在瑞士，几天前已经发生了大量抢购黄金的现象。在经济上受美国控制最严的加拿大，昨天在多伦多市也出现了被西方通讯社描写为“难以形容的和空前的”抢购黄金的热狂。甚至在美国国内，也发生抢购黄金狂。据报道，昨天在纽约市场上卖出的黄金总数达到二千万美元以上。但是，还有许多要求得到黄金的人未能得到满足。
    美联社经济评论员道逊谈到这种抢购黄金的风潮时指出，西欧有些银行家希望把美元储备转换成黄金，某些人认为美元现在已不是曾一度那样的最强硬的货币了。他们坚持认为，美国过去三年中的支付赤字和黄金外流可能迫使美元贬值。
    这次世界范围抢购黄金的风潮使得美国金融巨头们大为震动。纽约银行界的主要领袖昨天在得到消息后立即去会见美国财政部长安德逊，要求美国政府迅速采取措施制止这一风潮的发展。美国财政部昨天随即发表了一项企图稳定人心的声明说，继续维持每盎斯黄金三十五美元的比价是“我们坚定不移的立场”。
    但是，美联社在一条消息中不能不承认，“美国当局对美国国库的黄金继续外流越来越感到不安，这种黄金外流的情况使得全世界都不能肯定，美元是否能够保持它在世界货币中的价值”。（附图片）
