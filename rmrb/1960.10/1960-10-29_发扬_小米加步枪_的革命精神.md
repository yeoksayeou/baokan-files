    Promoting the Revolutionary Spirit of "Millet Plus Rifles"
    Fengtai Locomotive Depot Red Dragon Writing Group
    After reading Volume Four of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," we can see how, during the revolutionary war, our revolutionary army, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, relied on millet plus rifles to defeat the enemy with airplanes and tanks. In the early days of the War of Liberation, Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "What we rely on is only millet plus rifles, but history will ultimately prove that these millet plus rifles are stronger than Chiang Kai-shek's airplanes plus tanks." ("Conversation with American journalist Anna Louise Strong") History has fully proven Chairman Mao's brilliant conclusion. From this, we realize that in the face of the enemy, we must have the proletarian revolutionary spirit and great ambitions of daring to fight and daring to win; to defeat such a "powerful" enemy, we do not rely on heaven, earth, or the enemy's kindness, but on the working class's backbone and the spirit of long-term hard work and self-reliance.
    Revolution is like this, and so is construction. As early as 1949, in his report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, and the work is greater and more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now... We must ensure that comrades continue to maintain the work style of hard struggle." Today, as we carry out socialist construction, the objective conditions are much better than in the past. In the eleven years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have achieved tremendous achievements that have never been seen in history. However, our country is still "poor and blank," and the material conditions are still very poor. Therefore, in the advancing revolutionary cause, we will still encounter many difficulties. We cannot adopt a "denialism" attitude towards these difficulties. However, difficulties cannot stop us from moving forward. During the revolutionary war, we relied on millet plus rifles to overcome numerous difficulties and defeat the ferocious enemy. Today, as we build socialism, as long as we continue to promote the spirit of hard struggle of millet plus rifles, we will surely be able to overcome all temporary difficulties on the road ahead and move from victory to victory.
    In the face of difficulties, we should have the backbone of the working class and the ambition to overcome difficulties. As long as we correctly and fully exert subjective initiative, difficult conditions can be transformed into favorable conditions, let alone the objective conditions today are thousands of times better than during the revolutionary war. Small difficulties are small schools, and big difficulties are big schools. The greater the difficulty, the more it can temper people's revolutionary will. As the saying goes, poor people have great ambitions; and also, where there's a will, there's a way. Any difficulty can be overcome. Just imagine, if our revolutionary predecessors only emphasized that the enemy was "airplanes plus tanks" and they themselves were "millet plus rifles," and did not exert their subjective initiative, could they have defeated such a "powerful" enemy and achieved such a great victory?
    We can also think again, why could "millet plus rifles" defeat "airplanes plus tanks"? If we look purely from the material conditions themselves, "millet plus rifles" are indeed inferior to "airplanes plus tanks." However, the decisive factor is people. Millet plus rifles plus the People's Liberation Army are much stronger than airplanes plus tanks plus the Kuomintang army. Moreover, conditions can be changed. The PLA's millet plus rifles eventually became airplanes plus tanks, while the Kuomintang army's airplanes plus tanks were constantly captured by the PLA, and the iron tigers became paper tigers. Isn't this an obvious fact?
    In our vigorous socialist construction cause, countless advanced collectives and heroes who worked hard, relied on themselves, and overcame difficulties have emerged. For example, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, the national locomotive banner, has been the only old-type locomotive on the Beijing-Shanhaiguan line since the Great Leap Forward in 1958 (other groups have replaced it with domestically produced "Construction" type locomotives). Under the situation of continuously increasing traction tonnage and continuously increasing speed, from the perspective of the conditions of this locomotive, it is very difficult to complete the transportation task quickly, well, and economically. However, they have always been a red flag on the transportation front that has excellently completed its tasks. How was this "miracle" produced? The fundamental reason is that they promoted the spirit of hard struggle of "millet plus rifles," fully exerted their subjective initiative, mastered the laws of train operation, created a complete set of operating experience that conforms to the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, and transformed the locomotive's technical equipment in the high tide of the technical revolution, fundamentally changing the locomotive's backwardness.
    Believing that "millet plus rifles" are stronger than "airplanes plus tanks" is the revolutionary stand of the proletariat in despising the enemy. This spirit is based on the strategic thinking of despising difficulties strategically and paying attention to difficulties tactically. We have reason to despise difficulties as a whole. However, in specific struggles and specific work, we must pay attention to difficulties and carry out practical struggles against difficulties, solving specific problems one by one in a down-to-earth manner.
    The cause of socialism and communism is arduous and glorious, and complete victory can only be achieved through long-term hard struggle. The current overall situation is very good, and even if there are difficulties, they are only temporary and local. Let us promote the spirit of hard struggle of "millet plus rifles" in defeating powerful enemies and build our country into a great and powerful socialist country!

### 发扬“小米加步枪”的革命精神

    发扬“小米加步枪”的革命精神
    丰台机务段红龙写作组
    读了《毛泽东选集》第四卷，我们可以看到，在革命战争时期，我们的革命军队怎样在党和毛主席的英明领导下，依靠小米加步枪，战胜了飞机加坦克的敌人。在解放战争初期，毛主席曾经深刻地指出：“我们所依靠的不过是小米加步枪，但是历史最后将证明，这小米加步枪比蒋介石的飞机加坦克还要强些。”（《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》）历史完全证明了毛主席的英明论断。从这里我们体会到：在敌人面前我们必须具有敢于斗争、敢于胜利的无产阶级革命精神和雄心大志；战胜这样“强大”的敌人，不靠天，不靠地，不靠敌人发善心，而靠工人阶级的硬骨头和长期艰苦奋斗、自力更生的精神。
    干革命是这样，搞建设也是这样。毛主席早在1949年党的七届二中全会报告中就指出：“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白……务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”今天我们进行社会主义建设，客观条件已经比过去不知好多少倍。建国十一年来，我们已经取得了历史上从未有过的巨大成就。但是我们的国家还是“一穷二白”，物质条件还是很差的，因而在前进着的革命事业中，还会遇到许多困难。对待这些困难，我们不能采取“不承认主义”。但是，困难是不能阻挡我们前进的。在革命战争时期，我们依靠小米加步枪克服了重重困难，战胜了凶恶的敌人，在建设社会主义的今天，只要我们也继续发扬小米加步枪的艰苦奋斗的精神，就一定能够战胜一切前进道路上的暂时困难，从胜利走到胜利。
    在困难面前，我们应该有工人阶级的骨气，有战胜困难的雄心。只要正确地充分地发挥主观能动性，困难条件是可以转化为顺利条件的，更何况今天的客观条件比革命战争时期要好上千百倍呢。小困难是小学校，大困难是大学校，困难越大，越能锻炼人的革命意志。俗语说，人穷志气大；又说，有志者事竟成，任何困难都是可以克服的。试想，我们的革命前辈如果只强调敌人是“飞机加坦克”，自己是“小米加步枪”，不去发挥人的主观能动性，能够战胜那样“强大”的敌人，能够取得那样伟大的胜利吗？
    我们还可以再想想，“小米加步枪”为什么能够战胜“飞机加坦克”呢？如果纯粹从物质条件本身看，“小米加步枪”的确是不如“飞机加坦克”的。但是，起决定作用的是人，小米加步枪再加上解放军，那就比飞机加坦克再加国民党军队强得多。而且，条件是可以改变的。解放军方面的小米加步枪，在最后变成了飞机加坦克，而国民党军队方面的飞机加坦克，却不断为解放军缴获，铁老虎变成了纸老虎。这不是明显的事实吗？
    在我们轰轰烈烈的社会主义建设事业中，出现了无数艰苦奋斗、自力更生、战胜困难的先进集体和英雄。例如，全国机车旗帜“毛泽东号”机车，从1958年大跃进以来，是京山线仅有的一台老型机车了（其他小组都换了国产“建设”型机车）。在牵引吨数不断增加和速度不断提高的形势下，从这台机车的条件来看，要多快好省地完成运输任务，是有很大困难的，可是他们却一直是运输战线上出色完成任务的一面红旗。这个“奇迹”是怎样产生的呢？其根本原因是他们发扬了“小米加步枪”的艰苦奋斗精神，充分发挥了主观能动性，掌握了列车运行规律，创造了一整套符合多快好省原则的操纵经验，并在技术革命的高潮中改造了机车技术设备，从根本上改变了机车的落后面貌。
    相信“小米加步枪”比“飞机加坦克”还要强些，这就是藐视敌人的无产阶级的革命立场。这种精神是建筑在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难的战略思想基础上的。我们有理由从整体上藐视困难。但是，在具体斗争中，具体工作中，又要重视困难，向困难作切实的斗争，扎扎实实地一个一个地解决具体问题。
    社会主义和共产主义的事业是艰巨而光荣的，必须经过长期的艰苦奋斗，才能取得完全的胜利。当前总的形势非常好，即使有困难，也只是暂时的和局部的。让我们发扬“小米加步枪”战胜强大敌人的艰苦奋斗精神，把我国建设成为一个社会主义的伟大强国吧！
