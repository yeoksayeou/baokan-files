Lanzhou, October 20th (From our own correspondent) On the basis of vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, the Lanzhou Chemical Industry Company has widely mobilized the masses to tap labor potential. Since the beginning of this year, while completing a production task that is twice as large as last year, it has saved 2,585 laborers, achieving "increased production and tasks with reduced personnel."

This year, the company's production and machining tasks have both increased by more than double compared to last year, and the basic construction task has also increased significantly, thus the need for labor has also increased accordingly. When compiling the labor plan at the beginning of the year, although it was adjusted and compressed three times, it still required an increase of 2,000 laborers. In order to solve the need for increased labor, the company's Party Committee put forward the slogan of asking for labor from technical revolution. On the one hand, it carried out thorough and meticulous political and ideological education work, explained the situation, assigned tasks, and pointed out the direction to the masses, clarifying the great significance of saving labor. On the other hand, it widely mobilized the masses to find specific ways to save labor, and on this basis, adopted various effective organizational measures:

First, reduce the levels of organization and strengthen the front line of production. For example, the Construction Company originally had a four-level management structure of company, construction site, work section, and team. Now, the work section level has been abolished, and the construction site director directly leads the team, so that more than 150 cadres who were originally work section chiefs have returned to production posts, enriching the leadership and technical strength of the teams.

Second, change the labor organization to make it better adapt to the needs of the new situation and save labor. For example, the sand molding section of the machinery branch plant previously divided sand molding and cleaning into two teams. Although there were many sand molders, they did not take care of cleaning, so ordinary workers had to be used extensively because cleaning was often not completed in time. At its peak, the entire work section used more than 160 laborers. Now, sand molding and cleaning are merged into a mixed large class, which not only eliminates the need for ordinary workers, but also saves 50% of the labor in the entire work section.

Third, carry out all-rounder activities to achieve "one person with multiple skills, proficient in one and capable in several." At present, more than half of the workers in the company have achieved two skills, and many workers can do three, four, or even five types of work, creating extremely good conditions for fully exploiting labor potential.

Fourth, widely carry out technical performance competitions to generally improve workers' technical proficiency, improve labor productivity, and achieve the purpose of saving labor. For example, they originally had one person operating one compressor. Through technical performance competitions, they generally achieved one person watching two machines, and some people watched five machines, realizing one person doing the work of five, greatly saving labor.

Fifth, according to the nature of the work, replace men with women, replace the strong with the weak, and replace the young with the old, to reasonably use labor. The eighteen canteens in the factory alone have replaced more than 200 young and middle-aged workers, strengthening the front line of production.

Sixth, in accordance with the spirit of diligence and thrift in running enterprises, compress non-production personnel. Originally, the company had more than 880 service personnel. After strengthening political and ideological education and carrying out the "one person does the work of several" activity, work efficiency has greatly improved. Now, although there are only more than 640 people, the work is done even better.

Lanzhou, October 20th (From our own correspondent) The Lanzhou Municipal Engineering Company has adopted methods such as checking construction projects, checking planned arrangements, and checking construction measures to improve enterprise management, rationally adjust labor organization, and fully tap labor potential, greatly saving labor. As of October 14, it had saved 2,893 laborers, accounting for 53.6% of the total number of existing employees.

The Lanzhou Municipal Engineering Company's construction tasks this year are about half more than last year. The construction period for these projects is very tight, and the amount of earthwork and stonework is very large, requiring a large amount of labor. At the beginning of this year, the company's Party Committee required leading cadres at all levels to conduct detailed investigations and research on the use of labor on construction sites, and actively explore ways to save labor. Various construction sites carried out activities such as checking construction projects, checking planned arrangements, and checking construction measures, mobilizing the masses to focus on key production issues, organizing balanced construction, and ensuring the most rational use of labor. When arranging planned projects, each construction site first calculated the labor costs. Under the principle of concentrating forces to ensure key projects, production was arranged according to labor availability, completing one project before starting another, which not only saved labor but also accelerated the progress of key projects.

In order to better save and use labor, the company also reduced non-production personnel by adjusting the organizational structure of the construction site. They merged the original eight construction sites into four work areas and eliminated the company system, merging two companies into one work section, directly leading the teams, which reduced the levels and reduced non-production personnel to 6.1%. After saving 2,893 laborers, the company's production level still rose month by month, and by October 14, it had completed 93.78% of the annual construction plan. The saved labor has strengthened agriculture and the first line of production and construction.

    精打细算　合理安排　节约人力
    兰州化学工业市政工程两公司大挖劳动潜力生产增加人员减少
    本报兰州20日电　兰州化学工业公司在大搞技术革新和技术革命运动的基础上，广泛发动群众挖掘劳动潜力，今年以来，在完成比去年增大一倍生产任务的情况下，节约了二千五百八十五个劳动力，做到了“增产增事又减人”。
    今年，这个公司的生产和机械加工任务，都比去年增长一倍以上，基本建设任务也增长很大，因而对劳动力的需要也相应增加。在年初编制劳动计划时，虽然经过三次的调整压缩，但还是需要增加二千个劳动力。为了解决需要增加的劳动力，公司党委提出向技术革命要劳力的口号，一面深入细致地进行政治思想教育工作，向群众讲形势、交任务、指方向，说明节约劳动力的重大意义，另一方面广泛发动群众，寻找节约劳动力的具体途径，并在这个基础上，采取了各种有效的组织措施：
    第一、减少机构层次，加强生产第一线。如建设公司原来有公司、工地、工段、班组四级管理机构，现在撤销了工段这一级，工地主任直接领导班组，使原来担任工段长的一百五十多名脱产干部回到了生产岗位，充实了班组的领导和技术力量。
    第二、改变劳动组织，使劳动组织更好地适应新形势的需要，节约劳动力。如机械分厂的砂型工段，过去把砂型与清铲划为二个班组，砂型工虽多，但不管清铲，因此往往因为清铲来不及而不得不大量使用普通工，最高的时候整个工段使用了一百六十多个劳动力。现在，把砂型和清铲合并成一个混合大班，不但不再用普通工，整个工段还节约了50％的劳动力。
    第三、开展多面手活动，做到“一人多艺，精一兼数”。目前，全公司有一半以上的工人达到两面手，有许多工人能做三种、四种甚至五种工作，为充分发挥劳动潜力创造了极为良好的条件。
    第四、广泛地开展技术表演赛，普遍提高工人技术熟练程度，提高劳动生产率，达到节约劳动力的目的。如他们原来是一人作一台压缩机，通过技术表演赛，普遍地达到了一人看二台，有的人一人看了五台，实现了一人顶五人，大大节约了劳动力。
    第五、根据工作性质，以女换男、以弱换强、以老换壮，合理地使用劳动力。仅全厂十八个食堂就替换出来了二百多名青壮年工，加强了生产第一线。
    第六、根据勤俭办企业的精神，压缩非生产人员。原来这个公司的服务性人员有八百八十多人，在加强政治思想教育和开展“一人顶几人”的活动以后，工作效率大大提高，现在虽然只有六百四十多人，但是工作反而做得更好。
    本报兰州20日电　兰州市政工程公司采取查施工项目、查计划安排、查施工措施等办法，改进企业管理，合理调整劳动组织，充分挖掘劳动潜力，大大节约了劳动力。截至10月14日止，已节约出劳动力二千八百九十三人，占现有职工总数的53.6％。
    兰州市政工程公司今年担负的施工任务比去年增加了一半左右，这些工程工期都很紧迫，土方石方量非常大，需要大量劳动力。今年一开始，公司党委就要求各级领导干部深入工地对使用劳动力的情况进行细致的调查研究，积极摸索节约劳动力的途径。各工地开展查施工项目，查计划安排，查施工措施等活动，发动群众围攻生产关键，组织均衡施工，保证最合理的使用劳动力。在安排计划项目时，各工地都首先算劳动力账。在集中力量，保证重点的方针下，根据劳动力来安排生产，完成一项再开工一项，既节省了劳动力，又加速了重点工程的进度。
    为了更好地节约使用劳动力，这个公司还通过调整工地组织机构，减少了非生产人员。他们将原来的八个工地合并为四个工区，取消了中队建制，将两个中队合并为一个工段，直接领导小队，这样就减少了层次，使非生产人员下降到6.1％。这个公司节约出二千八百九十三个劳动力后，生产水平仍然月月上升，到10月14日已完成全年施工计划的93.78％。节约出的劳动力，加强了农业和生产建设第一线。
