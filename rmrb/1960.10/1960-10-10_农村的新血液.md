    New Blood in the Countryside
    Not long ago, many commune members in the rural areas of Ba County, Chongqing City, were spreading the news of skilled workers going to the countryside with beaming smiles. These workers were skilled workers from state-owned factories in Chongqing City who were freed up after the technological revolution to support the countryside. The county regarded them as new blood for building a socialist countryside, organized them into technical teams, and sent them to the fields, farm tool factories, pumping stations, power stations, and other places where they were most needed.
        Watering the Flowers of Technical Innovation
    Now, in the rural areas of Ba County, whether in the green paddy fields or in the golden sea of grain, whether by the green bamboo streams or beside the high rock waterfalls, you can see the flowers of technical innovation jointly nurtured by the workers sent to the countryside and the commune members – rice transplanters, threshing machines, motorized steel mills, ox-drawn waterwheels... As soon as the workers arrived in the countryside, they combined closely with agricultural production with their daring and proactive communist style, pushing the wave of agricultural technical transformation higher and higher.
    A story is circulating in the Baishi驿 People's Commune. When workers such as Shuai Zhiyun and Wen Liangkai arrived at the Baishi驿 People's Commune, they happened to meet commune members such as Gong Ruzhe who were researching a threshing machine, but the commune members were stumped by the power problem. Shuai Zhiyun suggested using a diesel engine supported by a large factory to drive the threshing machine and build a motorized threshing yard that could thresh both wheat and rice. This suggestion immediately aroused the interest of the commune members. More than a dozen commune members and workers sent to the countryside started working on it immediately, researching and designing overnight. They used an old threshing machine as a thresher, wooden sticks as transmission shafts, and stones as belt seats... However, during the test run, as soon as the belt was put on the wooden shaft, there was a "snap" and the iron nails at both ends of the rolling core broke. Some commune members were a little discouraged.
    At night, Shuai Zhiyun tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep. He thought a lot: "The national economy is based on agriculture, and we came to the countryside to make this foundation more solid. If we don't make a good start, future technological innovations will be..." Late at night, he suddenly turned over happily and got out of bed, running to Gong Ruzhe's bedside: "Old Gong, Old Gong! I have a solution! Using the principle of ball bearings, install sliding iron hoops on both ends of the wooden stick, and this will..." Before he could finish, Gong Ruzhe interrupted: "This will allow both ends of the wooden stick to be supported, right?" It turned out he had also been thinking about it for most of the night! Despite the late hour, Shuai Zhiyun and Gong Ruzhe immediately went to the farm tool factory workshop, woke up some masters, and worked together. Some were forging iron hoops, some were chopping wooden shafts... At dawn, a large group of people ran to a large dam to install the machinery. The diesel engine roared, and the threshing machine's drum spun rapidly. After failures and improvements, the threshing machine was finally successful. The work efficiency increased by 20 to 30 times, and women and children could also thresh grain, while ensuring that every grain was returned to the granary.
        Spreading New Technology
    In order to help farmers quickly master technology, the workers sent to the countryside always taught the farmers their technical knowledge with an eagerness and full enthusiasm. Wan Guorong's actions are one example.
    When he arrived at the Ba County Agricultural Machinery Factory, he found that the machines in the factory were not running at high speed because people were afraid of accidents if the speed was too fast. Wan Guorong thought: "I should find a way to break everyone's superstitious ideas." He first started by running at high speed. But some masters said that he used a knife brought from a large factory, so it was not surprising that he could run at high speed. Therefore, he tried to establish a model among the commune members. One day, he found that Wang Yongli had been turning a shaft for a whole shift but had not finished. He asked, "Why haven't you finished it yet?" Wang Yongli said, "Alas, the material is too hard to cut!" Wan Guorong carefully looked at the material and the angle of the tool, took off the tool, sharpened it, and then installed the tool, saying, "Run at 400 rpm!" "400 rpm?! It's only a few dozen rpm now!" "Don't be afraid, just run it!" There was a "click" and the tool cut into the workpiece, quickly turning up iron filings. Wang Yongli was turning it with fear and trembling, sweat constantly dripping from his forehead, and several masters watched with nervous expressions. However, the shaft was finished in less than an hour, without any accidents, and the product had a very good finish. Everyone felt that there was something to it. He took the opportunity to explain the principle of the lathe, the performance of the tool and the material, and advanced operating methods, which made everyone's mind clearer. Then, regardless of whether he was on or off duty, he would go to help others whenever he had time, teaching others how to sharpen tools by the grinder, and pointing out how to operate at high speed by the machine tool... In this way, a wave of enthusiasm for teaching and learning technology was set off in the entire workshop. All forty-two machinists mastered advanced technologies such as cutting with a large tool and running at high speed, and the work efficiency increased by three to four times. More than twenty apprentices who originally did not dare to use the machine tool quickly became skilled.
    Wan Guorong, together with other workers, also helped the factory establish technical lectures and run training courses, enabling more than eighty commune members to learn basic knowledge such as design, blueprint reading, and mechanical principles.

    农村的新血液
    不久以前，重庆市巴县农村的许多社员都奔走相告，笑逐颜开地传播着技术工人下乡的消息。这些下乡工人是重庆市国营工厂经过大闹技术革命腾出来支援农村的技术工人。县里把他们作为建设社会主义农村的新血液，将他们编成一支一支的技术队伍，输送到田间、农具厂、抽水机站、发电站等最急需的地方。
        浇灌革新花
    现在，在巴县农村里，不管是绿色稻田中，或者是金色谷海里，也无论是翠竹清溪边，或者高岩瀑布旁，你都可以见到下乡工人和社员群众共同浇灌出的技术革新的花朵——栽秧机、打谷机、机动钢磨、牛拉水车……。下乡工人一到农村，就以他们那种敢想敢干的共产主义风格，紧密结合农业生产，推动农业技术改造的浪潮一浪高过一浪。
    白市驿公社里流传着这样一个故事。帅治云、文良凯等下乡工人来到白市驿公社时，正碰上社员龚汝泽等人在研究一种脱粒的机器，社员们被动力问题难住了。帅治云建议用大厂支援的柴油机来带动打谷机，建立一个既可以打麦又可以打谷的机动脱粒场。这个建议一下就引起了社员们的兴趣。十多个社员和下乡工人说干就干，连夜研究设计。他们用旧打谷机作脱粒器，用木棒代传动轴，用石头作皮带座……。可是，试车时，刚把皮带搭上木轴一拖，“嚓”地一声，两头的铁钉滚心断了。一些社员有些灰心了。
    夜里，帅治云在床上翻来复去睡不着。他想得很多：“国民经济以农业为基础，我们下乡就是为了把这基础搞得更巩固，要是不把第一炮打响，今后的技术革新就……”深夜了，他忽然高兴地翻身起床，跑到龚汝泽床边：“老龚，老龚！有办法啦！用滚珠轴承的原理，把木棒两头装上滑动铁箍，这就……”还没等他说完，龚汝泽便一嘴接了过去：“这就可以使木棒两头能支持啦，对吗？”原来他也想了大半夜了！尽管夜很深了，帅治云和龚汝泽却即刻到农具厂车间，叫醒一些师傅，一起来干，他们有的打铁箍，有的砍木轴……。天一亮，一大群人就跑到一个大坝里把机具安装好。柴油机响动了，打谷机滚筒飞快地转动起来。后来又经过失败，改进，打谷机终于成功了。工效提高二、三十倍，而且妇女、小孩也可以打谷，同时做到了颗粒归仓。
        传播新技术
    下乡工人为了帮助农民迅速掌握技术，总是以迫不及待的心情，满腔热忱地把自己的技术知识教给农民。万国荣的行动就是其中一例。
    他到了巴县农械厂，发现厂里的机器都不开高速，人们怕车速快了要出事故。万国荣想：“我应该设法破除大家的迷信思想。”他便首先开高速。但有的师傅又说他是大厂带来的刀，开高速不奇怪。于是，他又设法在社员中树样板。一天，他发现王永礼车了一个班还没有把一个轴干车完。他问：“怎么还没有车完呢？”王永礼说：“咳，材料太硬，啃不动呀！”万国荣仔细地看了看材料和刀子的角度，把刀子取下磨了磨，然后安上刀子，说：“开四百转车速！”“四百转？！现在才几十转哟！”“不怕，开吧！”只听“吃”地一声，刀子吃进了工作物，飞快地翻起铁屑。王永礼胆战心惊地车着，额上不住地冒汗，几个师傅也以紧张的心情望着。可是，不到一小时就把轴干车好了，并没有出什么事故，而且产品光洁度很好。这下大家感到有名堂了。他便趁机讲了车床原理，刀具和材料的性能，以及先进的操作方法，大家心里更亮堂了。接着他又不分上班下班，一有空就去帮助别人，一会在砂轮旁教别人磨刀子，一会在机床旁指点学工开高速……。这样，全车间掀起了热心教技术、人人学技术的热潮，四十二个车工都掌握了吃大刀、开高速等先进技术，工效提高了三、四倍。原来不敢上机床的二十多个学工很快就成了熟手。
    万国荣还同其他工人一道，帮助厂里建立了技术讲座，办训练班，使八十多个社员学到了设计、识图、机械原理等基础知识。
