To Create Favorable Conditions for Burning Firewood and Grass in Rural Canteens
    Ping Shan County Promotes the "Suction Stove"
    The Suction Stove Saves Firewood and Grass, Serves Multiple Purposes with One Fire, Saving Labor, and is Simple in Structure with Convenient Materials

According to a report from the Hebei Daily, the Guda Production Team canteen of Jianping Commune in Pingshan County, Hebei Province, has created a "suction stove" that burns thatch, saves firewood, saves labor, concentrates firepower, and cooks multiple pots with one fire, opening up avenues for rural canteens to burn thatch.

    When you mention the "suction stove," commune members will enthusiastically tell you about it. It has eight major benefits: First, it can save manpower and enrich the front line of production. This stove has multiple pots per stove and multiple uses per fire, automatically drawing air, requiring only one person to add firewood and watch the fire. The canteen for the team's two hundred and fifty-seven members has freed up eight cooks to join agricultural production. Second, due to the automatic air intake, it overcomes the shortcomings of old stoves that couldn't ignite firewood, improving the utilization value of firewood and grass. In the past, it took five hundred pounds of firewood and grass to cook a meal, but now two hundred pounds is enough. Third, it saves coal and reduces costs. This stove can widely use thatch, rotten grass, and leaves to replace coal. Fourth, multiple pots per stove and multiple uses per fire create conditions for diversified meals. Fifth, it shortens cooking time and reduces the labor intensity of cooks. In the past, it took four hours to cook a meal, but now it only takes forty minutes. Sixth, using the suction stove eliminates flames and dust, making it hygienic and safe. Seventh, the canteen has become a potassium fertilizer plant, accumulating large amounts of plant ash and increasing fine fertilizer. Eighth, the suction stove is simple in structure, convenient to obtain materials, easy to manufacture, and easy to promote.

    The Pingshan County Party Committee attached great importance to the creation of the Guda Production Team and hailed this stove as the Guda-style "suction stove," promoting it throughout the county. Currently, 526 public canteens in the county have built "suction stoves," completely burning thatch, saving the state more than 870,000 jin of coal and saving production teams 26,500 yuan in expenses within eighteen days, while also freeing up 1,028 cooks to join the front line of agricultural production.

    In order to promote this advanced experience throughout the county, the Pingshan County Party Committee introduced the benefits of the "suction stove" in detail at a five-level cadre meeting. To solve the technical difficulties in building the stove, the County Party Committee held an on-site meeting at the Guda Production Team canteen, and each commune and production team had a secretary personally in charge of this work, launching a concentrated effort to build them.

    Currently, each commune and production team is seizing the current favorable season, combining it with the "Three Autumns" production, mobilizing commune members to collect firewood and grass to solve the fuel needs of the canteens.

    给农村食堂烧柴草创造有利条件
    平山县推广“吸风灶”
    吸风灶省柴草，一火多用节省劳力，构造简单取材方便
    据河北日报消息　河北平山县建屏公社古道生产队食堂创造一种烧茅柴、省柴、省工、火力集中、一火烧多锅的“吸风灶”，为农村办食堂烧茅柴打开了道路。
    提起“吸风灶”，社员都会热情地告诉你。它有八大好处：第一，可以节约人力，充实生产第一线。这种灶，一灶多锅，一火多用，自动吸风，只要一人添柴看火，全队二百五十七口人的食堂，已腾出八名炊事员投入了农业生产。第二，由于自动吸风，克服了旧灶烧柴不起火的缺点，提高了柴草的利用价值。过去需用五百斤柴草才能做熟饭，现在二百多斤就够了。第三，节约煤炭，降低成本。这种灶可以广泛地利用茅柴、烂草、树叶代替煤炭。第四，一灶多锅，一火多用，为饭菜多样化创造了条件。第五，缩短了做饭时间，减轻了炊事员劳动强度。过去一顿饭要做四个小时，现在四十分钟就行了。第六，使用吸风灶，没焰火、没灰尘，既卫生、又安全。第七，食堂变成了钾肥厂，大量积集了草木灰，增加了细肥。第八，吸风灶构造简单，取材方便，制造容易，便于大力推广。
    中共平山县委很重视古道生产队这一创造，并把这一炉灶誉为古道式“吸风灶”，在全县普遍推广。现在，全县已有五百二十六个公共食堂建成“吸风灶”，完全烧用茅柴，十八天内就为国家节省煤炭八十七万多斤，生产队节省开支二万六千五百元，还腾出一千零二十八名炊事员投入了农业生产第一线。
    平山县委为了在全县推广这一先进经验，在五级干部会议上详细介绍“吸风灶”的好处。为了解决建灶中的技术困难，县委在古道生产队食堂召开了现场会议，各公社、生产队都有一名书记亲自抓这一工作，突击修建。
    现在，各公社、生产队正抓紧当前有利季节，结合“三秋”生产。发动社员打柴拾草，解决食堂所需用的燃料。
