Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa: The world's highest city, the Pari area in the eastern Himalayas, located 4,500 meters above sea level, has successfully trialed crop planting this year and achieved a good harvest. Currently, over 400 *ke* (one *ke* roughly equals one *mu*) of highland barley and potatoes in the entire area have been harvested successively. The highland barley stalks are over two *chi* tall, with large, plump ears, each containing over a hundred grains. The already threshed highland barley generally yields around 150 *jin* per *ke*. Potatoes generally weigh more than half a *jin* each, with a yield of about 1,000 *jin* per *ke*. More than ten kinds of vegetables such as kohlrabi, radishes, and spinach are also abundant. One kohlrabi weighs up to eight *jin*, is juicy and sweet, and is called "Pari's Apple" by the Tibetan people. One radish weighs more than ten *jin*.

	Pari belongs to Yadong County in the Jiangzi Special District of Tibet and is an important town between Yadong and Lhasa. It is surrounded by mountains, and many peaks are covered with snow all year round. The highest temperature here throughout the year is around 16 degrees Celsius, and the lowest is more than minus 20 degrees Celsius, with a frost-free period of only about 70 days. It is often shrouded in clouds and fog, and sometimes it snows heavily even in June. In the past, people who had been to Pari believed that crops could not grow here. The hundreds of Tibetan households who have lived in Pari for generations do not farm; grain and vegetables have always been transported from other regions. People rely entirely on porterage, odd jobs, and petty trade for a living. In previous years, one could see patches of tender green highland barley seedlings here, but no field of highland barley ever yielded grain. The purpose of the Tibetan people planting these highland barley was to harvest grass to sell to passing merchants to feed livestock. Although the Tibetan people here lived in very difficult conditions and often could not afford to buy grain, no one was willing to grow crops at that time. Because, they had tried various ways to plant crops several decades ago, and some people had even succeeded in planting them, but when the highland barley was about to ripen, the local feudal ruling class forcibly ordered it to be cut down, saying, "If highland barley is harvested, people in Pari will die, and the entire Tibet will suffer."

	With the great victory of suppressing the rebellion and the democratic reform, the people of Pari became masters of their own destiny. The Party and the government led the local people to conduct trial plantings. The Yadong County Party Committee transferred 1,000 *jin* of highland barley seeds, which only required 60 days of growing time, from Gala, dozens of *li* away, and called on all *xiang* and mutual aid teams to conduct widespread trial plantings. The Pari working team then conducted specific research and arrangements, and, in light of Pari's characteristics, proposed measures to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture in accordance with local conditions. The Tibetan people generally deep-plowed the land two to three times, to a depth of about one *shi chi*, and applied at least 10,000 *jin* of fertilizer per *ke*, and planted seeds more than 30 days earlier, which greatly advanced the maturity period of the highland barley. In mid-September, light frost began to fall, and seeing that the highland barley, which was about to ripen, was about to suffer losses, the working team and the weather station led everyone to use the method of smoke to effectively overcome the attack of the frost. Throughout the entire trial planting process, the working team, cadres from various agencies in Pari, and officers and soldiers stationed there all participated in production together with the masses, and taught the Tibetan people sowing, weeding, fertilizing, irrigating, and other methods one by one, all the way until the harvest.

	The meticulous care of the Party and the government further boosted the enthusiasm of the Tibetan people, and they launched a patriotic production increase red flag competition from the time of sowing. In the red flag competition, which focused on accumulating and transporting fertilizer, 600,000 to 700,000 *jin* of fertilizer were accumulated and transported in a few days, averaging more than 1,000 *jin* per *ke*. Bianba Jibu, who was more than sixty years old, got up before dawn and groped to transport fertilizer. The members of the Ama Pubu mutual aid team dug fertilizer mud at night with lights on. They regarded each experimental plot as a treasure and worked meticulously. Each *xiang* and team had dedicated personnel to take turns guarding and managing.

	The leadership of the Party and the hard work of the people of Pari finally created a miracle, ending the history of this high-altitude and cold region not producing grain. The people of Pari were all deeply grateful to the Party and Chairman Mao for this, and they reported the good news to the Tibet Work Committee of the CPC and the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region with the best highland barley, etc.

    世界第一高城——西藏帕里地区
    第一次试种庄稼获丰收
    这里拔海四千五百米，无霜期七十天左右，粮菜历来依靠外地供应
    据新华社拉萨电　喜马拉雅山东部海拔四千五百米的世界第一高城——帕里地区，今年第一次试种庄稼成功并且获得了丰收。现在全区四百多克（一克地约等于一亩）青稞、洋芋都已陆续收割。青稞秆高两尺多，穗大粒肥，一穗多到百余粒，已经打场的青稞一般每克产一百五十斤左右。洋芋一般每个半斤多，每克产一千斤左右。圆根、萝卜、菠菜等十多种蔬菜也是丰收。圆根一个重到八斤，水多汁甜，藏胞叫它“帕里的苹果”。萝卜一个有十斤多重。
    帕里属西藏江孜专区亚东县，是亚东到拉萨间的重镇。它在群山环抱中，许多峰顶终年覆盖着白雪。这里的全年最高温度为摄氏十六度左右，最低在零下二十多度，无霜期只有七十天左右。它经常被云雾笼罩着，有时6月间还下大雪。过去，到过帕里的人们都认为这里不能生长庄稼。世代居住帕里的几百户藏胞，没有一户种地，粮食、蔬菜向来依靠外地运来，人们全靠背运、帮零工和作小买卖为生。往年在这里也能看到一片片嫩绿的青稞苗，但是没有一块地的青稞收过粮食。藏胞们种这些青稞的目的是收草，卖给来往客商喂牲口。尽管这里的藏胞生活很困难，经常买不上粮食吃，但那时谁也不愿意种庄稼。因为，他们在几十年以前曾经千方百计试种过，有的人还试种成功了，但在青稞快成熟时，当地封建统治阶级却硬叫割掉，还说什么“收了青稞帕里要死人，整个西藏也都要受灾。”
    随着平叛和民主改革的伟大胜利，帕里人民翻身当家作主后，党和政府领导当地人民进行试种。中共亚东县委从几十里外的嘎拉给调来一千斤生长期只要六十天的青稞种籽，号召各乡、各互助组普遍试种。帕里工作队接着作了具体研究和安排，针对帕里特点提出了因地制宜地贯彻农业“八字宪法”的措施。藏胞们普遍深翻地二至三次，深达一市尺左右，每克地最少施肥一万斤以上，并且提前三十多天下种，这样大大提前了青稞的成熟期。9月中旬开始下轻霜，眼看快要成熟的青稞就要受损失，工作队和气象站又领导大家用烟熏的办法，有效地战胜了寒霜的袭击。在整个试种过程中，工作队和帕里各机关干部、驻军官兵都和群众共同参加生产，把下种、锄草、施肥、灌水等方法一一传授给藏胞，一直到收割。
    党和政府无微不至地关怀，更加鼓起了藏胞们的干劲，他们从播种起就展开了爱国增产红旗竞赛。在以积、运肥为主的红旗竞赛中，几天就积、运肥六、七十万斤，平均每克地一千斤以上。六十多岁的边巴吉布，天不亮就起床摸着运肥。阿马普布互助组的组员们晚上点着灯挖肥泥。他们把每块试验地都视如珍宝，作到了精耕细作。各乡、组都有专人轮流看守和管理。
    党的领导和帕里人民的辛勤劳动，终于创造了奇迹，结束了这个高寒地区不产粮食的历史。帕里人民都因此衷心感激党和毛主席，他们用最好的青稞等向中共西藏工委和西藏自治区筹备委员会报喜。
