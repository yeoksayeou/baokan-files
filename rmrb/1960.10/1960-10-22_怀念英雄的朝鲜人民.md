In the heroic month of October, the banks of the Yalu River are filled with the scene of a bountiful harvest. Guo Changqi, a former volunteer soldier, stood before sunflowers laden with fruit, his fervent heart flying once more to the southern bank of the Yalu River. Two years ago, when he bid farewell to the heroic position of Shangganling, he divided a pot of large sunflowers he had personally cultivated into two halves, giving one half to his Korean People's Army comrade, Liu Zongmeng, and taking the other half back to his homeland. He clasped Liu Zongmeng's hand and said, "These are seeds we brought from the North China Plain of our motherland, grown on your heroic land. They represent the fruits of victory irrigated by the blood of the Chinese and Korean peoples. Now we must part, let them forever blossom and bear fruit on the lands of China and Korea, passing down through generations."

As the saying goes, "One thinks of relatives all the more on festive occasions." The tenth anniversary of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea has arrived. In every post in our motherland, how many former volunteer soldiers, like Guo Changqi, are immersed in memories of the heroic Korean people! They fought side by side with the Korean people and defeated the vicious American robbers; in the days of victory and peace, they filled in bomb craters and rebuilt the homes of the Korean people together.... When reporters interviewed these former volunteer soldiers, they were filled with excitement. Some opened small red cloth packages, took out a piece of shrapnel brought back from the Shangganling position, or a handful of soil brought back from the banks of the Imjin River, recalling and discussing the days of hardship shared with their Korean People's Army comrades; others took out military uniforms and socks mended by Korean "Amani" (mothers), telling of the profound friendship of the Korean people. General Dai Runsheng, a former volunteer with greying hair, looked at a silk-woven Korean landscape painting hanging on the wall of his bedroom and said with emotion, "This was given to us by Marshal Kim Il-sung when we returned home two years ago. In the past two years, every time we see it, we think of Korea's beautiful rivers and mountains, and its heroic people. Their brave and hardworking image and their lofty internationalist spirit of boundless love for the volunteer army forever stir our hearts."

Former volunteer soldiers who returned from Shangganling all remember the people of the Pyonggang area in Korea. There is the immortal internationalist fighter, the son of the great Korean people – Park Jae-geun, the respected "Volunteer Army Mama" Ham Jae-bok, and the tenacious girl, Seok Gil-ryeong. They regarded the volunteer army as family. In battle, they carried stretchers, delivered ammunition, and repaired roads, supporting the volunteer army's victorious operations regardless of personal safety; they opened ice cellars in wind, snow and severe cold to wash the bloodstained clothes of the wounded volunteer soldiers.... Chen Jinyuan, former deputy instructor of the Ninth Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, said, "Every victory we had in Korea was inseparable from the love and support of the Korean people. We lived in a great internationalist friendship, a friendship forged with life and blood."

At a forum on the eve of the "Double Ten" festival, Yang Ying, a former volunteer artillery company commander, deeply missed a Korean mother on the banks of the Imjin River. It was one night nine years ago when Yang Ying led the artillery team towards the 38th parallel. Suddenly, they were attacked by enemy aircraft, and some soldiers were injured. At this moment, this Korean woman appeared in the crowd of rescuers, braving the bombing and strafing of enemy aircraft, tearing off her white skirt to bandage the wounded soldiers. But in that instant, a thatched hut at the foot of the mountain next to the road was also set on fire by enemy aircraft, which was her home, and the cries of children came from inside. The soldiers immediately went to rescue them, bandaged the injured children, and carried them to their mother. However, the mother was already carrying a seriously wounded volunteer soldier on her back and running to the air-raid shelter in the mountain depression, shouting as she ran: "Volunteer Army comrades, give the wounded and the children to me, you go to the front line to fight the enemy!" Yang Ying and the soldiers immediately shouted "Avenge the Korean people!" and rushed to the front line that night to participate in the battle, using artillery to bombard the enemy fiercely. Now, nine years later, Yang Ying spoke while wiping his tearful eyes. He said: "I didn't cry at the time, my eyes were dried by anger. But now, I miss those heroic and respectable Korean mothers more and more."

What is Korea like now? How many factories and schools have been built from the ruins? How many fields have the "Friendship Reservoir" and the "Friendship Canal", built together, irrigated this year? When we said goodbye two years ago, we built a new house for the "Volunteer Army Mama" and planted chestnut trees at the door, will they bear fruit in the autumn? Also, the Masson pines we planted with the People's Army comrades on Shangganling, Dingzi Mountain, Songyue Mountain, and on the banks of the Imjin River, must be growing well! ... Two years is not a long time, but the outstanding Chinese sons and daughters who have shed blood and sweat there have kept all this in their hearts. They do not miss every news item and every photo about Korea in the newspaper. Whenever Korean songs are played on the radio or loudspeaker, they cannot help but sing along. When they heard in Beijing that tall buildings were standing tall in heroic Pyongyang, when they saw photos of the Songdo Dam, which had been completed in the heroic city of Kaesong, in the Tianshan pasture ... how encouraging and inspiring is the good news that the people of North Korea are riding the "Chollima"! Shen Juncang, a former volunteer soldier living on the north bank of the Yalu River, looked across the river and saw Sinuiju, the Korean land he first set foot on when he went abroad to fight ten years ago—at that time, this beautiful city was bombed into a scorched earth by American air bandits, but today, ten years later, it is already a modern city with forests of chimneys and tall buildings rising from the ground. With joy in his heart, Shen Juncang often tells his old comrade Li Feng about the achievements of the Korean people's construction that he has seen and heard. Li Feng is a former comrade of Wang Yongwei, a martyr of the Luo Shengjiao-style internationalist. Since returning to China, he has been missing the Korean people whose village was named "Wang Yongwei Village" by the Korean government. He said excitedly to Shen Juncang: "Truly, separated by a river, friendship is hard to part! When we were in Korea, we thought of our motherland, and when we returned to our motherland, we thought of Korea. The suffering of the Korean people is our pain, and the happiness of the Korean people is our joy."

Former volunteer soldiers deeply care about the people of southern Korea who are in dire straits. They warmly applaud the heroic struggle of the people there against American imperialism and its lackeys. They will never forget the towering crimes of the American robbers in Korea, the accusations of the people of Seoul against the "mass graves", and the warm welcome they gave to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army that year. Niu Zhenyuan, a former volunteer soldier who participated in the liberation of Seoul in January 1951, said that it was just in time for the Spring Festival, and the people of Seoul welcomed us with rice cakes and fine wine. They angrily accused the American beasts of their crimes of rape, adultery, arson, and murder, and resolutely demanded that we avenge them! Many "Abaji" (old grandfathers) voluntarily led the way for us in the heavy snow to pursue and annihilate the fleeing enemy. Chang Enju, a former volunteer artillery platoon leader, still misses a kind Korean mother on the north bank of the Han River. Chang Enju was honorably wounded in the Han River blocking battle and lived in the home of a fifty-year-old "Amani". She stayed by Chang Enju's side every day, feeding him water and food like a mother, and taking care of his bodily needs... When Chang Enju was healed and about to leave, the "Amani" had tears in her eyes, stuffed hot eggs and apples into his military uniform pocket, and repeatedly said: "Child, you must come back." Chang Enju said with emotion: "We will never forget the lovely Korean mothers." When we visited Li Zuo, a commander of a certain unit of the former Volunteer Army, he took out a Korean map that he had treasured for more than nine years from the cabinet and said: "This was given to me by an old Korean grandfather on the south bank of the Han River. Although he didn't say anything at the time, I knew his intention. In the days and nights of the Han River blocking battle, this map helped us. After returning to the motherland, I often flipped through it, reading news about the heroic struggle of the people in southern Korea. How much we miss them, how much we are encouraged! We will always be with the heroic Korean people, firmly believe that their struggle will surely be victorious, the American aggressors must get out of Korea, and the three thousand miles of beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea will surely be peacefully unified!"

Outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people - former volunteer soldiers, salute the heroic Korean people!

    怀念英雄的朝鲜人民
    新华社记者　姜庆肇　李健羽
    在英雄的10月里，鸭绿江畔一片丰收景象。前志愿军战士郭长祺站在果实累累的向日葵前，一颗火热的心又飞向了鸭绿江南岸。两年前，当他告别英雄阵地上甘岭的时候，曾经把自己亲手栽培的一盘大向日葵分成两半，一半送给朝鲜人民军战友柳宗孟，一半带回祖国他的家园。他紧握着柳宗孟的手说：“这是我们从祖国华北平原带来的种子，在你们英雄的土地上长大的。它代表中朝两国人民用鲜血灌溉的胜利果实。现在我们要分别了，让它永远在中朝两国土地上开花结果，代代相传。”
    人逢佳节倍思亲，抗美援朝十周年来到了。在我们祖国的各个岗位上，有着多少和郭长祺一样的前志愿军战士，都沉浸在对英雄朝鲜人民的怀念中啊！他们曾经和朝鲜人民一起打败了凶恶的美国强盗；在胜利与和平的日子里又一起填平了弹坑，重建朝鲜人民的家园……。当记者访问这些前志愿军战士的时候，他们满怀激动的心情，有的打开小红布包，拿出从上甘岭阵地上带回来的一块弹片，或者从临津江畔带回来的一撮泥土，回忆着，谈论着同朝鲜人民军战友并肩作战的那些艰难与共的日子；有的拿出了朝鲜“阿妈尼”（妈妈）给缝补过的军衣和鞋袜，诉说着朝鲜人民的深厚情谊。鬓发斑白的前志愿军戴润生将军，望着挂在他寝室墙壁上的一幅锦织朝鲜风景画，感情激动地说：“这是两年前我们回国时，金日成元帅送给我们的。两年来，我们每看到它，就想起了朝鲜的锦绣河山，英雄的人民。他们勇敢勤劳的光辉形象和对志愿军无限热爱的崇高国际主义精神，永远激动着我们的心。”
    从上甘岭归来的前志愿军战士们，都怀念着朝鲜平康地区的人民。那里有不朽的国际主义战士、伟大朝鲜人民的儿子——朴在根，有敬爱的“志愿军妈妈”咸在福和顽强的姑娘石吉荣。他（她）们把志愿军当作亲人。在战斗中抬担架、送弹药、修公路，不顾生命危险，支援志愿军胜利作战；她们在风雪严寒里打开冰窖，给志愿军伤员洗涤血衣……。原志愿军某部九连副指导员陈金元说：“我们在朝鲜的每一个胜利，都是和朝鲜人民的热爱和支援分不开的。我们生活在伟大的国际主义友谊中，这种友谊是用生命和鲜血结成的。”
    在“十·二五”前夕的一次座谈会上，前志愿军炮兵连长杨英深深地怀念着临津江畔一位朝鲜母亲。那是在九年前的一天夜晚，杨英率领着大炮队向“三八”线挺进。突然，遭受敌机袭击，有的战士负伤了。这时，这位朝鲜妇女出现在抢救的人群里，她冒着敌机的轰炸、扫射，扯下自己的白裙子给伤员包扎。可是就在这一瞬间，路旁山脚下一座茅屋也被敌机炸着火了，这是她的家，传来孩子的哭叫声。战士们立刻去抢救，把负了伤的孩子包扎好抱给母亲。可是，母亲却已经背着一位志愿军重伤员向山凹的防空洞跑去，她边跑边喊：“志愿军同志，把伤员和孩子都交给我，你们快上前线打敌人！”杨英和战士们当场高呼着“为朝鲜人民报仇！”连夜奔赴前线，参加战斗，用大炮狠狠地轰击了敌人。现在，事隔九年了，杨英边讲边擦着泪花湿润的眼睛。他说：“我当时并没有流泪，两眼被怒火烧干了。可是现在，却越来越想念那些英雄可敬的朝鲜母亲。”
    现在朝鲜怎么样？从废墟上又盖起了多少工厂和学校？一起修建的“友谊水库”和“友谊渠”，今年灌溉多少田地？两年前惜别时，给“志愿军妈妈”家盖起新房，在门口栽上了栗子树，秋天可结了果？还有，和人民军战友一起在上甘岭、丁字山、松岳山和临津江畔栽下的马尾松，长得该挺旺了吧！……两年的时间并不算长，可是曾经在那儿流过血汗的中国优秀儿女们，把这一切都放在心上。他们不放过报纸上有关朝鲜的每一条新闻，每一张照片。每当收音机或扩音器里传送出朝鲜歌曲时，他们就情不自禁地跟着唱起来。当他们在北京听说英雄平壤又矗立起一幢幢高大建筑物时，当他们在天山牧场看到了英雄城市开城已建成的松都大水库的照片时……，朝鲜北部人民骑上“千里马”的喜讯，多么鼓舞和振奋人心！住在鸭绿江北岸的前志愿军战士沈浚沧，隔江眺望，看到他们十年前出国作战时首先踏上的朝鲜国土新义州——那时候，这座美丽的城市被美国空中强盗炸成了一片焦土，而十年后的今天，她已经是一片烟囱林立、高楼平地起的现代化城市了。沈浚沧怀着欢悦的心情，经常把他看到和听到的朝鲜人民建设的成就告诉老战友李枫，李枫是罗盛教式的国际主义战士王永维烈士的生前战友，他从回国后就一直怀念着被朝鲜政府命名为“王永维村”的朝鲜人民。他对沈浚沧激动地说：“真是一江之隔，友情难分！我们在朝鲜的时候想祖国，回到祖国想朝鲜，朝鲜人民的灾难就是我们的痛苦，朝鲜人民的幸福就是我们的欢乐啊。”
    前志愿军战士们深切地关怀着处在水深火热中的朝鲜南部的人民。那里人民反抗美帝国主义及其走狗的英勇斗争，受到他们热情欢呼。他们永远忘不了美国强盗在朝鲜的滔天罪行，忘不了汉城人民对“万人坑”的控诉，和当年对中国人民志愿军的热情欢迎。曾经在1951年1月参加过解放汉城战斗的原志愿军战士牛镇元说，那时候正赶上过春节，汉城人民用米糕和美酒来欢迎我们。他们愤怒地控诉美国野兽奸淫烧杀的罪行，坚决要求我们为他们报仇！许多“阿巴基”（老大爷）在大风雪天自动给我们带路，去追歼逃窜的敌人。原志愿军炮兵排长常恩举至今还怀念着汉江北岸一位善良的朝鲜母亲。常恩举在汉江阻击战中光荣负伤，住在一位五十多岁的“阿妈尼”家里，她天天守护在常恩举身边，像母亲一样给他喂水喂饭，端屎端尿……。当常恩举伤愈要走的时候，“阿妈尼”眼泪汪汪，把热鸡蛋和苹果塞进他军衣口袋里，一再叨念着：“孩子，你们可要回来呀。”常恩举感动地说：“我们永远忘不了可爱的朝鲜母亲。”在我们访问前志愿军某部指挥员李佐的时候，他从橱柜里拿出一本珍藏九年多的朝鲜地图说：“这是汉江南岸一位朝鲜老爷爷送给我的。虽然他当时什么也没说，但是我知道他的心意。在汉江阻击战的日日夜夜里，这本地图帮过我们的忙。在回到祖国以后，我常常翻着它，看报纸上有关朝鲜南部人民英勇斗争的消息。我们多么怀念，多么受到鼓舞！我们永远和英雄的朝鲜人民在一起，坚信他们的斗争一定能胜利，美国侵略者必须从朝鲜滚出去，朝鲜三千里锦绣河山一定能和平统一！”
    中国人民的优秀儿女——前志愿军战士们，向英雄的朝鲜人民致敬！
