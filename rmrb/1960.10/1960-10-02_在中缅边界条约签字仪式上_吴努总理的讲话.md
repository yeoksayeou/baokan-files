Xinhua News Agency, October 1st. Premier U Nu's speech at the signing ceremony of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty is as follows:
    Your Excellency Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Your Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai, Chinese friends:
    October 1, 1960, will be recorded in history as a special day. It is not only the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which we are happy to celebrate, but also the day a new chapter begins in the relations between Burma and China. The treaty about to be concluded by our two governments will, for the first time in the history of our two countries, establish a completely demarcated and marked boundary, a boundary drawn by mutual agreement and therefore a boundary of peace and friendship.
    What I have just said in no way diminishes the traditional friendship that happily exists between our two countries. But in today's circumstances, when distances and obstacles are no longer insurmountable, even the best of neighbors, whose relations are firmly based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, should know exactly where one's territory ends and the other's begins, in order to faithfully implement the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, which is of utmost importance. Therefore, the work we are about to complete today is a natural and necessary development of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which our two countries helped to formulate. As such, it is a progress in the worldwide struggle for peace.
    As you know, the settlement of this boundary question has not been an easy task. Both sides needed to overcome many difficulties, some inherent in the issues themselves, and some left over by history. Therefore, progress would not have been possible without the desire on both sides to reach a settlement. The good result we have today is due to the high degree of friendship, understanding, and mutual concession shown by all sides. On behalf of the Government and people of the Union of Burma, let me take this opportunity, to express my respect to the Government and people of the People's Republic of China for the friendly and understanding attitude they have adopted on this issue. Special thanks are due to Premier Zhou Enlai, who was the chief architect on the Chinese side in creating this treaty. From the very beginning, Premier Zhou Enlai was involved with the work related to the treaty. Throughout the negotiations on this issue, he maintained a friendly, modest, patient, and understanding attitude. Even when difficulties seemed insurmountable, he never lost these qualities. In this regard, I would also like to mention Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and former Ambassador and current Head of the Chinese Delegation to the Joint Boundary Committee, Mr. Yao Zhongming, both of whom have also been closely involved in every stage of this issue. As Premier Zhou Enlai's direct assistants on this matter, they have made a great contribution to this pleasant achievement, and I would like to thank them both for pointing this out.
    Special praise should also be given to the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee for the outstanding work it has done in the past few months despite the most difficult hardships. Special mention should be made of the military and surveying personnel on both sides who worked in the field during the rainy season. The high degree of cooperation and understanding spirit which has been put into effect in the work of the Joint Committee at all levels, is a very good omen for the development of closer relations between our two countries.
    Let me take this opportunity to emphasize that the treaty we are about to sign is an agreement voluntarily reached by both parties to resolve the Sino-Burmese boundary issue. It would be ridiculous for anyone to say that this treaty was imposed by the Burmese side and that the Chinese side was unwilling. Moreover, the entire history of the boundary issue shows that the Chinese do not allow anything to be imposed on them. For many years, the British government tried to force the Chinese to accept the watershed between the Irrawaddy and Salween Rivers north of Hkyingan Shan as the boundary, but the Chinese refused. Therefore, when the British relinquished sovereignty over Burma, this section of the boundary remained undefined. However, it is worth noting that China, in negotiating with independent Burma, willingly agreed that this boundary should be demarcated along the watershed, except for a very small portion, about thirteen miles in the Hpimaw area. Similarly, the entire history of the Burmese people shows that the Burmese also do not allow anything to be imposed on them. Even when they lost their independence under the pressure of superior forces, they never lost their faith in their religion, culture, and basic way of life. Throughout the British occupation, their indestructible and strong confidence in these basic factors supported them, cultivated their will and determination to fight for freedom. Therefore, it would be equally ridiculous for anyone to say that this treaty was imposed on Burma by China. Today, we are signing the treaty voluntarily, based on the principle of absolute equality, and out of the belief that concluding this treaty is in the highest interests of Burma, in the highest interests of Sino-Burmese friendship, and in the highest interests of peace in Asia and the world.
    May this treaty that we are about to sign usher in a new era of closer friendship and deeper understanding between our two countries and peoples!

    在中缅边界条约签字仪式上
    吴努总理的讲话
    新华社1日讯　吴努总理在中缅边界条约签字仪式上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的刘少奇主席阁下，尊敬的周恩来总理阁下，中国朋友们：
    1960年10月1日将要作为一个特殊的日子载入史册。它不仅是我们愉快地参加庆祝的中华人民共和国成立纪念日，而且是缅甸和中国之间关系的新的一章开始的日子。我们两国政府就要缔结的条约，将使我们两国之间历史上第一次出现一条完全划定和标定的边界，这条边界是双方协议画出的，因此是一条和平和友谊的边界。
    我刚才所说的话一点也不意味着贬低我们两国之间幸运地存在着的传统友谊。但是在今天的情况下，当距离和障碍都不再是不能逾越的时候，即使是最好的邻邦，它们的关系已经牢固地建立在和平共处五项原则之上，也应该确切地知道一方的领土到哪里为止，另一方的领土从哪里开始，以便能够忠实地实行互相尊重主权和领土完整的原则，这一点是极端重要的。因此，我们今天即将完成的工作，正是我们两国帮助制定的和平共处五项原则的一项理所当然的和必要的发展。既然如此，它正是全世界争取和平的斗争的一个进展。
    你们知道，这次边界问题的解决不是一件容易的事。双方都需要克服许多困难，有些是问题本身带来的，有些是历史遗留下来的。因此，如果不是双方都具有达成解决的愿望，进展是不可能的。现在所以有了这样良好的结果，是由于双方都表现了高度的友好、谅解和互让的精神。让我代表缅甸联邦政府和人民，利用这个机会对中华人民共和国政府和人民在这个问题上所采取的友好和谅解的态度表示敬意。特别要对周恩来总理表示感激，他是中国方面缔造这个条约的主要的工程师。从最早的开始，周恩来总理就与问了和条约有关的工作。在这个问题的谈判过程中，他一直持着友好、谦和、耐心和谅解的态度。即使在困难看起来克服不了的时候，他也从没有失去这些品质。在这方面，我还愿意提到外交部章汉夫副部长，提到前任大使和现任边界联合委员会中国代表团团长姚仲明先生，他们两位也都同这个问题的每一阶段有过密切的关系。作为周恩来总理在这个问题上的直接助手，他们对现在这个令人愉快的成就作出了很大的贡献，我愿提出这点来感谢他们两位。
    还应该特别表扬中缅边界联合委员会在过去几个月中冒着最艰巨的困难而作出的卓越的工作。应该特别提到雨季中在野外工作的双方的军事人员和测量人员。联合委员会各级人员工作中所贯彻的高度的合作和谅解精神，对于我们两国间发展更加密切的关系是一个很好的预兆。
    让我借此机会强调指出，我们即将签字的这个条约，乃是双方为解决缅中边界问题而自愿达成的协议。如果任何人竟说这个条约是缅甸方面所强加，而中国方面是不愿意的，这将是可笑的。而且边界问题的整个历史表明，中国人是不容许把任何东西强加在他们身上的。英国政府曾经许多年试图迫使中国人接受尖高山以北以伊洛瓦底江和萨尔温江之间的分水岭为界，但是中国人不干，因此当英国人放弃对缅甸的主权时，这段边界仍然没有划定。但是，值得指出的是，中国在同独立了的缅甸谈判时，很愿意地同意了这段边界应该沿分水岭划定，只除了很小的一部分，即在片马地区的大约十三哩的地段。同样的，缅甸人民的整个历史表明，缅甸人也是不容许把任何东西强加在他们身上的。即使当他们在优势力量压迫下失去独立的时候，他们也从没有失去对自己的宗教、文化和基本生活方式的信仰。在整个英国占领时期，他们对于这些基本因素不可摧毁的坚强信心支持了他们，培育了他们争取自由的意志和决心。因此，如果任何人竟说这个条约是中国强加于缅甸的，那将是同样可笑的。今天我们在条约上签字，是自愿的，是基于绝对平等的原则，而且是出于这样的信念，即缔结这个条约符合缅甸的最高利益，符合中缅友谊以及亚洲和世界和平的最高利益。
    愿我们即将签字的这个条约在我们两国和两国人民之间开创一个友谊更密切、谅解更深刻的新纪元！
