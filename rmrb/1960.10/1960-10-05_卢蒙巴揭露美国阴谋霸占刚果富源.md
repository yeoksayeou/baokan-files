Lumumba Exposes American Conspiracy to Seize Congo's Rich Resources

Congo's Prime Minister Lumumba strongly condemned American imperialism for plotting to overthrow the legitimate government of Congo in order to seize Congo's uranium resources at a banquet held at the Guinean Embassy in Congo on the evening of the 1st, celebrating the second anniversary of Guinean independence. He said, "According to the American-Belgian privilege, 60 percent of Katanga's uranium is sold directly to the United States." Lumumba revealed that "American representatives tried to obtain privileges from me to exploit our resources." He accused them of "promising everything" and suggesting "giving us millions of dollars" in order to obtain his consent. However, he was "unwilling to sign a dishonest agreement without going through parliament." He also said that if he had "accepted dollars" from the United States, his government would not have been "dissolved."

According to UPI reports, Prime Minister Lumumba also said at the banquet that he still believed that he and Kasavubu could reach an understanding.

    卢蒙巴揭露美国阴谋霸占刚果富源
    刚果总理卢蒙巴一日晚在几内亚驻刚果大使馆为庆祝几内亚独立两周年举行的宴会上，强烈谴责美帝国主义为了霸占刚果的铀，阴谋推翻刚果合法政府。他说，“依据美（国）——比（利时）特权，加丹加的铀的百分之六十是直接卖给美国的”。卢蒙巴揭露说，“美国代表试图从我这里得到特权以开采我们的富源”。他指责说，为了得到他的同意，美国代表曾经向他“许诺了一切”，并且建议“给我们数以百万计的钱”。但是他“不愿意不通过议会而签订一项不正直的协议。”他还说，如果他从美国那里“接受美元”，他的政府就不会被人“解散”。
    据合众国际社报道，卢蒙巴总理在宴会上还说，他仍然相信他和卡萨武布可以达成谅解。
