Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang: Jiangxi: Comprehensively arrange labor, selling while harvesting, and transporting simultaneously, leading to a rapid increase in the purchase volume of cotton, hemp, tobacco, and tea.
Zhejiang: Carefully harvest, finely strip, and quickly sell yellow hemp. Gansu: Concentrated picking and centralized sale, with half of the new cotton entering the warehouse.
Guizhou: Vigorously promote tobacco processing, accelerating the progress of flue-cured tobacco purchasing. Ningxia: The annual procurement plan for livestock products is completed ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang: Since the early autumn crop harvest began in Jiangxi Province, Party committees at all levels, led by their secretaries, have established special procurement agencies at each level, assigning procurement and transfer tasks to communes and teams. Cadres at all levels have also been specifically assigned to ensure both production and procurement are handled well. Various localities have made comprehensive arrangements for labor, ensuring field management of late autumn crops while adopting a combination of professional teams and shock tactics to tap potential, squeeze time, seize opportunities, and launch a mass movement to harvest and sell agricultural and sideline products. In Yudu County, areas with heavy autumn field management tasks dispatched less labor, while areas with lighter tasks dispatched more. The main labor force was assigned to autumn field management, while auxiliary labor was assigned to harvest and sell agricultural and sideline products. During the day, they engaged in autumn field management, and at night, they sold agricultural products. From September 1st to 13th, the county mobilized more than 25,000 people in batches, overfulfilling the procurement plan for cotton, hemp, and other agricultural products by 1.1% ahead of schedule. Guangfeng, Leping, Wuyuan, and other counties categorized agricultural products such as cotton, hemp, tobacco, and tea, and made overall arrangements according to maturity time and quantity, closely integrating harvesting, processing, drying, and sales, conducting them in an interwoven manner. Professional teams were responsible during normal times, and large-scale shock tactics were organized during concentrated harvesting and sales, greatly accelerating the progress of harvesting, processing, and sales. While purchasing, various localities also organized short-distance transportation to ensure the timely delivery of various agricultural products to collection and distribution points.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou: People's communes in the hemp-producing areas of Zhejiang are actively harvesting, stripping, and selling new hemp. As of October 5th, Huangyan, Pingyang, Wenzhou, Ruian, and other counties had overfulfilled this year's procurement plan.

Zhejiang is a major jute-producing area in China. This year, leaders at all levels led the broad masses of commune members in the hemp-producing areas to overcome natural disasters such as typhoons, ensuring the good growth of jute. Since the start of the harvest and stripping, leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the front lines, grasping every link of stripping, soaking, washing, straightening, drying, and selling, properly arranging labor, and mobilizing commune members to carefully harvest, finely strip, and quickly sell. Various localities generally adopted the method of concentrating harvesting and stripping, concentrating fine washing, concentrating straightening and drying, unified grading and sorting by production teams, unified organization of sales, and unified settlement, accelerating the progress of harvesting, stripping, and sales. Many production teams in the hemp-producing area of ​​Haining County established professional teams, centralized use of drying yards, docks, and warehouses. As of the 5th, the county had harvested more than 150,000 dan of hemp, an increase of 56% compared with the same period last year. Six communes in Xiaoshan County mobilized commune members to launch a climax of harvesting, stripping, and selling, purchasing more than 80,000 dan of yellow hemp on September 30th, exceeding the highest monthly collection record in previous years.

Commercial departments in various hemp-producing areas actively improved procurement methods, dispatched a large number of personnel to the teams and fields to help production teams achieve timely harvesting and stripping, moderate fine washing, quick harvesting and quick selling, and good harvesting and good selling. At present, the province has also supplied and repaired more than 25,000 hemp stripping machines to speed up hemp processing and help rural areas save manpower.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou: Commercial departments in Gansu Province are seizing the current cotton harvest season to purchase new cotton. As of the end of September, the new cotton purchased and stored in the province accounted for more than half of the cotton picked. The quality of the purchased cotton is generally good.

This year, except for some cotton fields suffering severe drought, cotton in Gansu Province generally grew well. During the harvest season, various localities generally adopted the method of concentrated picking, centralized sales, and centralized processing. People's communes in various cotton-growing counties have organized a total of 791 cotton-picking professional teams, requiring fast picking, fast selling, and fast processing. In order to facilitate the sale of cotton by the people's communes, commercial departments increased the number of cotton purchasing stations from 190 to 226, and combined the purchasing stations with cotton processing plants, so that people's communes do not have to send cotton to the purchasing station and then to the processing plant when selling cotton.

Before cotton picking, commercial departments trained cotton grading technicians for communes and production teams. They guided commune members to implement separate picking, drying, and selling, so as not to confuse cotton of various grades, and carried out strict quality inspection of cotton, which not only ensured good cotton quality, but also facilitated commercial departments to implement the policy of pricing according to quality, taking into account the interests of the country, the collective, and commune members.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang: Tobacco-producing areas in Guizhou Province are vigorously promoting flue-cured tobacco processing, accelerating the speed of new tobacco purchasing. The province's flue-cured tobacco procurement volume increased by 42% in late September compared with early September.

This year, the tobacco fields planted in Guizhou's tobacco-producing areas are concentrated and contiguous, and the harvesting period is consistent. Therefore, timely processing of tobacco leaves such as baking and grading is the key to promoting the timely sale of flue-cured tobacco. Since the beginning of August, various flue-cured tobacco producing areas have generally promoted advanced baking experience based on the semi-drying and semi-baking rapid baking method, and the rapid double-handed grading and bundling method to shorten processing time and improve processing quality. Due to the promotion of semi-drying and semi-baking rapid baking technology, the baking time is generally shortened from the original three or four days to about one day; the baked tobacco leaves have more oil and better color, and can also save fuel and increase the utilization rate of baking rooms. Qianxi County originally planned to need 8,800 baking rooms, but after the widespread adoption of the semi-drying and semi-baking method, only 2,500 were needed.

Commercial departments in various localities organized a large number of purchasing personnel to go deep into production teams and baking rooms to teach processing technology and help solve problems in processing in a timely manner. The provincial commercial department has trained more than 10,000 skilled hands in double-handed grading and bundling for various tobacco-producing areas, increasing the efficiency of grading from more than 20 jin per person per day to more than 80 jin. Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan: The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has completed the annual procurement plan for livestock products ahead of schedule. As of October 7th, the annual procurement plans for livestock products such as cashmere, goat hair, goat skin, cowhide, black fox skin, domestic rabbit skin, Tan sheep skin, and grass rabbit skin have all been overfulfilled; the annual procurement plans for products such as sheepskin, sheep wool, goose and chicken down, camel hair, and miscellaneous skins are also nearing completion. The quality and specifications of the purchased livestock products have all met the national standards.

This year, Party committees and commercial departments at all levels in the autonomous region have paid more attention to the political and ideological education of commune members than usual, and have meticulously carried out organizational work related to procurement. Procurement personnel of commercial departments in Yanchi, Tongxin, Haiyuan, Lingwu, Pingluo and other places pushed small carts loaded with daily necessities while going to the countryside for procurement, selling and purchasing in rural areas, which not only facilitated commune members, but also ensured the timely completion of procurement tasks. The Autonomous Region Livestock Products Company often sends cadres and technicians to various places to provide technical guidance on livestock product processing. For example, when the spring cashmere season came, it sent more than 900 technicians to communes and production teams in Yanchi, Haiyuan, and other counties that are rich in Tan sheep, both guiding cashmere harvesting and purchasing cashmere, thus overfulfilling the cashmere procurement plan by more than 50,000 jin. At present, employees of commercial departments at all levels are continuing to vigorously carry out procurement work during the current peak season for agricultural and sideline product procurement.

The Xinsheng Production Team of Guali Commune in Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, adopted the method of stripping, washing, drying, and selling at the same time, and sorted out more than 60,000 jin of refined hemp in three days and sold it to the purchasing station to support the country's industrial construction.

    开展群众性的农副产品交售运动
    江西：全面安排劳动力边收边售边运，棉麻烟茶收购量迅速增加
    浙江：精收精剥快收快售黄麻　甘肃：集中采摘集中交售半数新棉入库
    贵州：大抓烟叶加工工作烤烟收购进度加快　宁夏：全年畜产品收购计划提前完成
    据新华社南昌电　江西省各地人民公社结合早秋作物收获，组织社员采摘和交售棉、麻、烟、茶及各种土特产品，交售量正在迅速增加。
    江西省从早秋作物收获开始，各级党委即由书记挂帅，层层成立了收购专管机构，将收购、上调任务落实到社、队；各级干部也具体分工，做到既搞好生产又搞好收购。各地对劳动力作了全面安排，在保证晚秋作物田间管理的前提下，采取专业队与突击相结合的办法，挖潜力、挤时间、抓空隙，大搞群众运动，采摘和交售农副产品。于都县采取秋田管理任务大的地区少出人力，秋田管理任务小的地区多出人力，主要劳力搞秋田管理，辅助劳力采摘和交售农副产品，白天搞秋田管理，晚上交售农副产品的办法，全县从9月1日到13日发动二万五千余人，分期分批送售，使棉麻等农产品的交售计划超额1.1％提前完成。广丰、乐平、婺源等县对棉、麻、烟、茶等农产品分类排队，按照成熟时间、数量多少，全面安排，使采制、晾晒、交售紧密结合，穿插进行，平时由专业队负责，集中采摘交售的时候组织大突击，大大加速了采制、交售进度。各地一边收购，一边调运，大搞短途运输，保证各种农产品及时运送到集运点。
    新华社杭州电　浙江麻区各人民公社积极收剥和出售新麻。到10月5日止，黄岩、平阳、温州、瑞安等县已超额完成今年收购计划。
    浙江是我国黄麻的主要产地。今年，各级党委领导麻区广大社员战胜了台风等自然灾害的侵袭，保证了黄麻生长良好。从开始收剥以来，各级领导干部深入第一线，抓住剥、浸、洗、整、晒、售各个环节，妥善安排劳力，发动社员精收细剥，快收快售。各地普遍以生产队为单位，集中收剥，集中精洗，集中整晒，由生产队统一分级整理，统一组织交售，统一进行结算，加快了收剥、交售进度。海宁县麻区许多个生产队建立了专业队、集中使用晒场、河埠、仓库，全县到5日止已收麻十五万多担，比去年同期增加56％。萧山县六个公社发动社员，掀起收剥交售高潮，9月30日一天收购黄麻八万多担，超过了历年的最高月收纪录。
    各麻区商业部门积极改进收购方法，抽调大批人员深入到队到田，帮助生产队做到适时收剥，适度精洗，快收快售，收好售好。目前，全省还供应和修配好了二万五千多台剥麻机，加快黄麻加工进度，并帮助农村节约人力。
    新华社兰州电　甘肃省商业部门抓紧在当前棉花收获季节收购新棉。到9月底止，全省收购入库的新棉占已摘棉花的一半以上。收购的棉花质量一般良好。
    甘肃省今年除部分棉田遭受严重旱灾以外，一般生长良好。在收获季节中，各地普遍采取了集中采摘、集中交售、集中加工的办法。各植棉县的人民公社共组织了七百九十一个采棉专业队，要求做到采摘快、交售快、加工快。为了便利人民公社交售棉花，商业部门将棉花收购站由一百九十个增加到二百二十六个，并且将收购站与棉花加工厂合在一起，使人民公社在交售棉花时，不必在送到收购站后再送加工厂。
    商业部门在棉花采摘以前，就为公社、生产队培养了棉花验级技术人材。他们指导社员实行分摘、分晒、分售，不使各种等级的棉花混淆，并对棉花进行严格的质量检查，既保证了棉花质量良好，也有利于商业部门贯彻按质论价的政策，兼顾国家、集体、社员三者的利益。
    据新华社贵阳电　贵州省各产烟区大抓烤烟加工工作，加快了新烟收购速度。全省烤烟收购量9月下旬比上旬增长42％。
    贵州各产烟区今年种植的烟田连片集中，收获期一致，因此，及时做好烟叶的烘烤、分级等加工工作，是促使烤烟适时交售的关键。各烤烟产区从8月初起，普遍推广了以半晾半烘快速烘烤法为主的烘烤先进经验，和双手快速分级扎把法，以缩短加工时间，提高加工质量。由于推广半晾半烘快速烘烤技术，烘烤时间一般从原来三、四天缩短为一天左右；烘出的烟叶油分多、色泽好，还能节约燃料，提高烘房利用率，黔西县原计划需要八千八百间烤房，在广泛采用半晾半烘法以后，只需要二千五百间就够了。
    各地商业部门组织大批采购人员，深入到生产小队和烘房，传授加工技术，帮助及时解决加工中的问题。省商业部门已为各产烟区训练了双手分级扎把能手一万余名，使分级的工效从原来每人每天二十多斤提高到八十多斤。新华社银川电　宁夏回族自治区已经提前完成今年全年的畜产品收购计划。截至10月7日止，羊绒、山羊毛、山羊板皮、牛皮、黑猾皮、家兔皮、滩羊皮、草兔皮等畜产品的全年收购计划都已超额完成；绵羊皮、绵羊毛、鹅鸡绒毛、驼毛、杂皮等产品的全年收购计划，也接近完成。收购的畜产品的质量、规格，都达到了国家规定的标准。
    今年自治区的各级党委和商业部门，都比往常更加注意对社员的政治思想教育，并且细致地进行了有关收购的组织工作。盐池、同心、海原、灵武、平罗等地商业部门的收购人员，在下乡收购时，推上小车，装上日用百货，在农村边销售、边收购，既便利了社员，又保证了收购任务的及时完成。自治区畜产公司经常派干部和技术工人，到各地进行畜产品加工技术指导工作。如在春季抓羊绒季节来到时，就派出九百多名技术工人，分别到盛产滩羊的盐池、海原等县的公社和生产队，一面指导抓羊绒，一面收购羊绒，因而使羊绒收购计划超额五万多斤完成。目前，各级商业部门职工仍在当前农副产品收购旺季中，继续大力进行收购工作。（附图片）
