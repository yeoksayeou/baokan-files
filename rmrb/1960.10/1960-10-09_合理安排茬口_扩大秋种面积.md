Rationally Arrange Crop Rotations to Expand Autumn Planting Area
Wei Zishen, Deputy Director of the Guizhou Provincial Department of Agriculture

Vigorously developing summer harvest crops and increasing the proportion of summer harvests has enormous potential in our province, and is of strategic significance for the high-speed development of agricultural production.

Expanding Autumn Planting Area
Must Solve the Two-Season Contradiction

Guizhou Province is a mountainous area with a mild climate and abundant rainfall. Most areas have no severe winters and a short frost period. These superior climatic conditions are very suitable for developing summer harvest crops. For example, wheat can be grown in most winter fields except for a few high-altitude, barren soils and waterlogged or muddy fields. Although the province's summer harvest area has expanded unprecedentedly this year, it is still less than half of the cultivated land, and the potential for expanding summer harvest crops is enormous.

Before liberation, Guizhou was basically a single-cropping system per year. Summer harvest crops only developed rapidly after liberation. From 1949 to this year, the summer harvest area has more than tripled, which is a huge achievement. However, the proportion of summer harvests in the total annual harvest is still not large, with summer grain accounting for only about 10% of the total annual grain output. Therefore, on this basis, it is required that the autumn planting area continue to be expanded this year to increase the area of land with two crops a year.

Transforming the cultivation system is a delicate and complex task. In the process of transformation, great efforts are needed to solve a series of specific problems. The urgent task is to earnestly implement the planting plan, and to do this well, it is necessary to rationally arrange crop rotations and properly resolve the contradiction between summer and autumn crops.

The contradiction between summer and autumn crops arises under certain environmental conditions, where the cultivation system and technical measures cannot fully meet the growth and development requirements of the two crops. Under the current circumstances, this contradiction is manifested in three aspects:

(1) Due to the different sowing and harvesting periods required by different crops, they often compete for the season during the planting handover period. This phenomenon is most obvious in high-altitude areas and between crops with long growth periods. (2) Due to the need for sufficient nutrients for both crops, they compete for soil fertility. (3) They compete for labor. Labor and animal power are strained during the busy harvest and planting seasons. However, these contradictions can be resolved. We have initially grasped the causes of their occurrence and their interrelationships. As long as we summarize and promote the experience of the vast number of farmers, and make full use of favorable conditions and overcome unfavorable factors, the difficulties can be completely overcome. The current favorable conditions are: the people's communes provide extremely favorable conditions for unified land use and rational crop rotation; Guizhou has many types of crops and varieties, which can fully meet the requirements of rational matching of the two crops; there are many mountains and lush grass here, and fertilizer sources are abundant, especially phosphorus fertilizer is sufficient. As long as green manure is vigorously accumulated and planted, the fertilizer requirements of the two crops can be better resolved. Many areas in Guizhou Province have already achieved a lot of successful experience. For example, Zunyi, Meitan and other places use water-saturated fields to grow wheat, rain-fed fields to grow early-maturing rapeseed, and seedling fields to grow broad beans and green manure, which can solve the contradiction between rice and summer harvest crops. It seems that whether the two-season contradiction can be solved depends not on how much is planted, but on whether people's subjective initiative is brought into play.

Scientifically Arrange Crop Rotations

How to solve the two-season contradiction? The key lies in scientifically and meticulously arranging crop rotations, organically linking summer harvest crops and autumn harvest crops, and rationally utilizing the land. According to the situation in Guizhou Province and the experience of the masses, arranging crop rotations should be based on the premise of guaranteeing the completion of the national plan, considering both the past and the future, making overall plans, adapting to local conditions, and ensuring a comprehensive and annual bumper harvest. In terms of specific arrangements, it is mainly based on the local climate conditions and soil conditions to rationally match crop types and varieties, and change cultivation methods to adapt to the requirements of two or three seasons in paddy fields and dry land.

Rationally Match Crop Types and Varieties

The climate of Guizhou Province can fully meet the growth time requirements of the two crops. At the same time, it is also possible to stagger the sowing and harvesting seasons to avoid excessive concentration of farm work, thereby ensuring timely sowing of various crops. Taking paddy fields as an example, they are generally more fertile than dry land. In order to ensure a bumper harvest of summer grain and oil, and not delay rice transplanting, major crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and broad beans, as well as green manure crops, should be planted in various situations. In high-altitude areas, crops have a longer growth period. In order to ensure timely rice transplanting, it is suitable to plant late-sown and early-maturing spring wheat and rapeseed. In subtropical areas, in order to achieve three crops a year, rapeseed or green manure with a shorter growth period can be planted after the late rice harvest. In flatland areas, which are often deficient in fertilizer, some green manure should also be planted in a planned way to ensure that rice has sufficient fertilizer. As for dry land, since there are many types of two-season crops planted and the sowing period is early or late, it is even more necessary to match them rationally and arrange them carefully to ensure a bumper harvest.

Rationally matching crop types and varieties should not only ensure multiple plantings, but also ensure high yields. Therefore, it is also necessary to pay attention to planting according to local conditions and crop rotation to fully exploit the land's potential for increased production. In the rational matching of crop types and varieties, a growth period schedule should also be implemented to stagger the sowing season. The experience here is: autumn sowing should be in the order of peas, broad beans, rapeseed, and wheat; the same crop should be sown first with varieties with a longer growth period, and then with varieties with a shorter growth period.

Adopt Corresponding Cultivation Methods

In order to ensure a bumper harvest in both seasons, the most widely used cultivation method in Guizhou Province is intercropping. Before autumn sowing, intercropping arrangements should be made according to the requirements of spring sowing. For example, wheat is sown in wide and narrow rows, and crops such as corn and cotton can be intercropped in the wide rows at the appropriate time in the coming spring. In such fields, peas, broad beans or green manure can be intercropped in the wide rows this winter, which can also increase some income. The second is rapeseed seedling transplanting. According to experiments, in relatively loose and fine soils, victory rapeseed seedling transplanting can obtain the same yield as direct sowing, and early transplanting significantly increases production compared to late direct sowing. Using this method can make full use of the land where autumn harvest crops are harvested later, and transplant rapeseed in a timely manner, so as not to reduce yield due to delayed direct sowing.

Timely harvesting and sowing also plays a big role in two-season crop rotation. In many areas of Guizhou Province, some crops are not harvested in time. Wheat is mostly harvested in the dry mature period, and after the harvest, plowing is often not done early due to improper arrangement of farm work, which delays the sowing of autumn harvest crops. If each season's crops are harvested in the yellow mature period, under the weak sunshine conditions in Guizhou Province, it can generally be advanced by six or seven days, which is not only conducive to early spring and autumn sowing, but also reduces dry scorching, grain dropping, and mold and rot losses due to rain.

Arranging crop rotations lies in being early and in specific implementation. Before the autumn harvest, the crop rotation should be arranged in conjunction with the formulation of the autumn planting plan and the three-guarantee plan. What will be planted in each plot of land this autumn? What will be planted next spring? When to sow? What cultivation methods and technical measures will be adopted? etc., must be determined as soon as possible, and all preparatory work should be done in light of specific arrangements.

    合理安排茬口　扩大秋种面积
    贵州省农业厅副厅长　卫自慎
    大力发展夏收作物，提高夏季收成比重，在我省潜力极大，这对于高速度发展农业生产，具有战略性的意义。
    扩大秋种面积
  必须解决两季矛盾
    贵州省是一个气候温和、雨量充沛的山区，大部分地区冬无严寒，霜期不长。这些优越的气候条件，非常适宜发展夏收作物。例如小麦，除少部分高山瘦土和囤水田、烂泥田外，绝大部分冬季田土都可以种植。全省今年夏收面积虽然空前扩大，尚不及耕地的一半，扩种夏收作物的潜力十分巨大。
    解放前贵州基本上是一年一熟制，夏收作物在解放后才有了迅速的发展。从1949年到今年，夏收面积扩大了两倍多，这是一项巨大的成绩。但是，夏季收成在全年收成中的比重仍旧不大，夏粮只占全年粮食总产量的10％左右。因此，在这个基础上，今年秋种面积要求继续扩大，增加一年二熟制的耕地面积。
    变革耕作制度，是一项细致复杂的工作，在变革过程中，需要经过巨大的努力，解决一系列的具体问题。当务之急是赶紧扎扎实实地落实种植计划，而要做好这项工作，又必须合理安排茬口，妥善解决夏秋两熟作物之间的矛盾。
    夏秋两季作物之间的矛盾，是在一定的环境条件下，耕作制度和技术措施不能完全适应两季作物生长发育的要求而产生的。在目前情况下，这个矛盾表现在三个方面：
  （1）由于不同作物要求不同的播种、收获期，往往在种植交接期间，互相争夺季节。这种现象在高寒地区以及生育期较长的作物之间最为明显。（2）由于两季作物都需要足够的养分，互相争夺地力。（3）互相争夺劳力。收种季节农活集中，劳力、畜力紧张。然而这些矛盾是可以解决的，我们已经初步掌握了它的产生原因及其相互关系，只要总结和推广广大农民的经验，充分运用有利条件，克服不利因素，困难完全能够克服。现在的有利条件是：人民公社给土地统一使用、合理轮作换茬提供了极有利的条件；贵州作物种类多，品种多，完全可以满足两季作物合理搭配的要求；这里山多草茂，肥源丰富，特别是磷肥充足，只要大力积制和增种绿肥，可以较好地解决两季作物对肥料的要求。贵州省不少地区已经取得了很多成功经验，如遵义、湄潭等地采用饱水田种小麦，望天水田种早熟油菜，秧田种胡豆、绿肥的办法，便可以解决水稻与夏收作物的矛盾。看来两季矛盾能不能解决，不在于种多种少，而在于是否发挥了人的主观能动作用。
      科　学　地　安　排　茬　口
    两季矛盾如何解决？关键在于科学地细致地安排好作物茬口，把夏收作物和秋收作物有机地衔接起来，合理地利用土地。根据贵州省情况和群众经验，安排茬口应在保证完成国家计划的前提下，瞻前顾后，通盘考虑，因地制宜，合理搭配，确保全面丰收，全年丰收。在具体安排上，主要是根据当地气候条件和田土情况，合理搭配作物种类、品种，改变栽培方式，以适应稻田和旱地两季或三季的要求。
    合理搭配作物种类和品种
    贵州省的气候，完全可以满足两季作物生育时间的要求。同时，也可以错开播种、收获季节，避免农活过分集中，从而保证各种作物适时播种。以稻田而论，一般比旱地肥沃，为了保证夏粮和油料丰收，又不耽误水稻栽秧，应分别情况多种小麦、油菜、胡豆等主要作物和绿肥作物。高寒地区作物生育期较长，为了保证水稻及时栽插，适宜种迟播早熟的春性小麦和油菜。亚热带地区，为了达到一年三熟，则可在晚稻收后种植生育期较短的油菜或绿肥。平坝地区，往往缺肥，为了保证水稻有足够的肥料，还应有计划地多种一些绿肥。至于旱地，由于种植的两季作物种类多，播种期有早有迟，更要搭配合理，安排周到，才能保证丰收。
    合理搭配作物种类和品种，不仅要保证多种，而且要保证丰产。因此还必须注意因地种植和轮作换茬，充分发挥土地增产潜力。在合理搭配作物种类、品种中，还应实行生育期排队，错开播种季节。这里各地的经验是：秋季应按照豌豆、胡豆、油菜、麦类的顺序播种；同一作物又应先播生育期较长的品种，后播生育期较短的品种。
      采用相适应的栽培方式
    为了保证两季丰收，在栽培方式上贵州省采用最广泛的是套种。秋种前就根据春播要求作好套种安排，如麦类实行宽窄行条播，明春即可在宽行中适时套种包谷、棉花等作物。在这样的地里，今年冬季在宽行中先间作豌豆、胡豆或绿肥，还可以增加一些收益。其次，是油菜育苗移栽。据试验，在土质比较松细的土壤上，胜利油菜育苗移栽可获得与直接播种相同的收成，而且早移栽的比晚直播的显著增产。采用这种方法，能够充分利用秋收作物收获较迟的土地，适时移栽油菜，不致因直播误期而降低产量。
    抢收抢种对两季换茬也有很大作用。贵州省许多地区部分作物收割不够及时，小麦多半在枯熟期才收，收后又往往因农活安排不当而不能及早翻犁，延误秋收作物播种。如果每季作物都在黄熟期抢收，在贵州省日照情况不强的情况下，一般即可提早六、七天，不仅有利于春秋两季早播，也能减少枯焦落粒及遇雨霉烂损失。
    安排茬口在于早，在于具体落实。秋收以前就应结合制定秋种计划和三包方案，把茬口安排好，哪块田土今秋种什么？明春种什么？何时播种？采用什么栽培方式和技术措施？等等，都须及早确定下来，并针对具体安排，做好一切准备工作。
