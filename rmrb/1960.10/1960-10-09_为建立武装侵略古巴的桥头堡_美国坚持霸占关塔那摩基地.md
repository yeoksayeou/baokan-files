    To Establish a Bridgehead for Armed Aggression Against Cuba
    U.S. Insists on Occupying Guantanamo Base
    Xinhua News Agency, 8th: According to a United States Information Service report from Washington on the 7th, the U.S. State Department, in a policy statement given to U.S. Representative Flood, reiterated the U.S. plot to continue occupying its Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba. The United States is currently using this base as a haven for Cuban counter-revolutionaries and a bridgehead in the event of a U.S. armed aggression against Cuba.
    In its statement, the U.S. State Department stubbornly declared that the United States would "maintain the Guantanamo naval facilities" based on an agreement it had imposed on Cuba decades ago, and that "the State Department has no intention of agreeing to abolish this agreement or abandoning this base."

    为建立武装侵略古巴的桥头堡
    美国坚持霸占关塔那摩基地
    据新华社8日讯　据美国新闻处7日自华盛顿报道，美国国务院在它交给美国众议员弗勒德的一项政策声明中，重申美国阴谋继续霸占它在古巴的关塔那摩海军基地的立场。美国目前正利用这个基地作为庇护古巴反革命分子的巢穴和一旦美国对古巴发动武装侵略时的桥头堡。
    美国国务院在它的声明中蛮横地宣称，美国要根据它在几十年前强加于古巴的协定“保持关塔那摩的海军设施”，“国务院无意同意废除这项协定或放弃这个基地”。
