The Key to Persisting in the Use of New Technologies

In March of this year, this newspaper published an editorial entitled "Inspirations from the Coal Loading Machine" regarding the process of creating the coal loading machine at the Fuxin Coal Mine. From the process of creating the coal loading machine, we gained many beneficial insights into correctly carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Over the past few months, the coal industry system across the country has been promoting and using coal loading machines, which has presented us with some new experiences, allowing us to understand more clearly: what key links should be grasped to make new technologies universally promoted, persistently used, and drive the high-speed development of the entire social production.

Using coal loading machines to load coal, whether from the perspective of improving labor productivity or reducing the labor intensity of coal loaders, its superiority is very obvious compared to manually loading coal with shovels. However, this superiority is not deeply felt by all mines. Some mines have consistently used coal loading machines and have good production conditions; some mines started enthusiastically, but relaxed leadership during the process of using them, and stopped halfway when they encountered a little setback. After the leaders discovered and gradually solved some problems arising in the process of use, they picked up the coal loading machines again; some coal mines encountered some difficulties in the process of using coal loading machines, and even stopped using them altogether. Therefore, seriously analyzing and summarizing the experience of promoting and using coal loading machines has universal practical significance for promoting the continuous advancement of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement and promoting the smooth development of the increase production and practice economy movement.

What does the process of promoting and using coal loading machines in the coal industry system illustrate? It vividly tells us that any new technology or new experience, even if it has such significant effects like the coal loading machine and is so simple and easy to manufacture and operate, is by no means "all is well" with just a call. On the contrary, to make these new technologies and new experiences persist in use after being universally promoted, to incorporate this new technology into the normal process flow, and to be familiar with, willing to use, and persevere to the end by the broad masses of workers and staff, we must do a lot of meticulous work and solve many new problems in a timely manner, including problems in ideological understanding, technology, and management. Otherwise, things that have already been universally promoted will inevitably take a "step back." The Xishan Mining Bureau in Shanxi had such an experience. When coal loading machines first appeared, the promotion work of this mining bureau progressed quickly. However, due to the workers' lack of proficiency in operating techniques, some problems appeared in the machines themselves, and aspects such as upper and lower processes, maintenance, and repairs did not keep up, the effectiveness of the machines was not fully utilized, but instead affected the normal progress of production, and as a result, the workers picked up their large shovels again. After the leadership discovered this problem and solved it in a timely manner, the coal loading machines persisted in use. The facts most clearly show that the widespread application of a new technology to production is often much more complex than creating a new technology; if we do not pay attention to solving the specific problems in the promotion and use, it will be difficult to promote it universally, and after promotion, it will be difficult to persist in it and use it to the end.

Any new creation inevitably has a development process from rough to refined, from imperfect to perfect. People's understanding is also the same. When a new technology or new experience is first created, it generally only meets scientific requirements in terms of basic principles and basic structure, and the production process is also relatively rough. Therefore, in the process of large-scale and widespread use, some problems and defects in design or manufacturing that are not precise enough, and structures that are not perfect enough will inevitably appear. And these problems are often not easy to discover, or even impossible to discover, in the creation process. Only after gaining re-understanding through practice and application can more problems be discovered, and then continuously improved and gradually perfected. What is worth mentioning here is that the promotion of new technologies must not be mechanically copied. Due to different specific conditions, when adopting foreign experiences, various regions must make corresponding improvements according to local conditions to adapt them to new environments and new conditions. For example, the coal loading machine created by the Fuxin Coal Mine is very good to use locally, but when used in other coal mines, due to the different geological conditions, coal seam hardness, mining methods, as well as manufacturing technology and equipment conditions of each coal mine, it may not be easy to use. Therefore, the process of using any new technology is also a process of continuous innovation and continuous improvement. Ignoring this point, new technologies and new experiences will be difficult to persist in use.

The emergence of any new technology or new experience is by no means isolated, but is interconnected with various links and aspects up, down, left, and right. The use of a single new technology or new experience is only part of the production process. If this part adopts new technologies and new experiences and improves production efficiency, the related parts must follow up accordingly. Otherwise, there will be a situation of uncoordination and maladaptation. For example, after the No. 3 well of Shandong Huafeng Coal Mine promoted the use of the combined coal loading and material transporting machine, it required the distance of the supports to be increased accordingly; the expanded distance of the supports then required the roof management to follow up. If these problems are not solved, the combined coal loading and material transporting machine cannot be used, and even if it is used, there will inevitably be roof fall and other accidents, affecting the safety of production. Therefore, after the widespread promotion of major technical innovation projects, it will inevitably cause a series of changes in the entire production process, process flow, technical management and production management, and labor organization. In this way, in the process of promoting and using new technologies and new experiences, we must not only solve a series of problems that arise from itself in a timely manner, but also solve the problems before and after it, and the problems of its neighbors on the left and right, so that the up, down, left, and right form a unified whole, coordinate with each other, and improve together.

Timely solving the technical personnel problems in operation and maintenance is also very important. Just as having a steed requires having a knight who is good at riding it, having new technology also requires having talents who master the new technology. As can be seen from the news in today's newspaper about the persistence in using coal loading machines in the No. 18 coal mining section of the No. 10 pit of the Fuxin Xinqiu Coal Mine, although the machines are very effective, the workers find it difficult to use them due to their lack of proficiency in operating techniques. This requires paying close attention to improving the workers' operating techniques so that they can quickly master the laws of using new technologies and new experiences. In fact, only in this way can the new technology and experience be transformed into something familiar to the masses, and a necessary set of operating technical procedures can be established to ensure that everyone follows the procedures.

Over the past few months, the promotion and use of coal loading machines has brought us very beneficial experiences. To summarize these experiences: the promotion of any new technology must not be satisfied with general calls, but must have specific guidance; it must be continuously improved and continuously improved in the process of promotion and use; in the process of promoting and using new technologies and new experiences, all links up, down, left, and right must be quickly adapted to follow up, and attention must be paid to training talents who master the new technology. Of course, whether these experiences can be accepted by enterprise leaders depends on whether they have the correct attitude and viewpoint towards new things. Only with the guidance of the correct viewpoint can they dare to innovate and achieve victory. The above are the keys to persisting in promoting and using new technologies; and what attitude the leaders take in using new technologies and new experiences is the key of the keys.

    坚持使用新技术的关键
    今年3月间，本报曾就阜新煤矿创造攉煤机的经过，发表过一篇题为“攉煤机给我们的启发”的社论。从攉煤机的创造过程中，使我们得到了许多关于正确开展技术革新和技术革命运动的有益启示。几个月来，全国煤炭工业系统推广、使用攉煤机的经过，又给我们提出了一些新经验，使我们可以更清楚地理解到：究竟应当抓住那些关键环节，才能使新技术普遍地推广开来，坚持使用下去，推动整个社会生产高速度发展。
    使用攉煤机攉煤，无论从提高劳动生产率来看，或是从减轻攉煤工人的劳动强度来看，比起用铁锹人力攉煤，它的优越性都是非常明显的。但是，这种优越性并不是所有矿井都能深切体会的。有些矿一直坚持使用攉煤机，生产情况很好；有些矿开始搞得轰轰烈烈，使用过程中却放松了领导，遇到一点挫折，就中途停顿下来，当领导上发现使用过程中产生的一些问题逐一加以解决以后，他们又重新拿起攉煤机来；也有一些煤矿在使用攉煤机过程中遇到一点困难，竟至根本不用了。因此，认真分析、总结推广使用攉煤机的经验，对于促进技术革新和技术革命运动的不断前进，促进增产节约运动顺利地开展，具有普遍的实际意义。
    煤炭工业系统推广使用攉煤机的经过，究竟说明了什么呢？它生动地告诉了我们：任何一项新技术、新经验，即使有如攉煤机这样效用显著，制造和操作技术这样简便易行的新技术，也决不是号召一下就“万事大吉”了。相反，要使这些新技术、新经验在普遍推广之后能够坚持使用，能够把这项新技术纳入正常的工艺流程中去，并且为广大职工群众所熟悉，乐于使用、坚持到底，就必须做许多细致的工作，及时解决许多新的问题，包括思想认识上的、技术上的和管理上的问题。否则，已经普遍推广了的东西，也不免要走“回头路”。山西西山矿务局就有过这样的经验。当攉煤机开始出现的时候，这个矿务局的推广工作进行很快。可是，由于工人们操作技术不够熟练，机器本身出现了一些问题，以及上下工序、维护、检修等方面没有跟上去，机器的效用不但没有得到充分发挥，反而影响生产正常进行，结果工人们又拿起了大铁锹。当领导方面发现了这个问题，及时解决以后，攉煤机就坚持使用下去了。事实最清楚地说明，一项新的技术广泛地应用到生产上去，比之创造一项新技术常常要复杂得多；如果不注意去解决推广使用中的具体问题，就很难普遍推广，推广以后，也难坚持下去，使用到底。
    任何一项新创造都必然有一个由粗到精，由不完善到完善的发展过程。人们的认识也是如此。一项新技术、新经验在它刚创造出来的时候，一般只是在基本原理和基本结构上合乎科学要求，制作过程也比较粗糙。因此，在大量广泛使用的过程中，就必然出现一些设计或制造上还不够精密，结构上还不够完善等等方面的问题和缺陷。而这些问题，往往又是在创造过程中不容易发现，甚至是不可能发现的。只能通过实践和应用获得再认识以后，才能发现更多的问题，才能加以不断改进，逐步完善。这里值得提出的是，新技术的推广，决不能机械搬用。由于具体条件不同，各地在采用外地经验的时候，必须按本地情况作相应的改进，使之适应新的环境和新的条件。比如，阜新煤矿创造的攉煤机在当地是很好使用的，用到其他煤矿去，由于各煤矿的地质情况、煤层硬度、采煤方法，以及制造技术和设备条件的不同，就不一定好使用了。因此，一切新技术的使用过程，也就是不断革新、不断提高的过程。忽视了这一点，新的技术、新的经验也就很难坚持使用下去。
    任何一项新技术、新经验的出现，决不是孤立存在的，而是同上下左右各个环节、各个方面相互连接在一起的，单项新技术、新经验的使用只是生产过程的一部分。这一个部分采用了新技术、新经验，提高了生产效率，与其相关的部分就必须相应地跟上去。否则，就会出现不协调、不适应的状况。比如，山东华丰煤矿三号井推广使用攉煤运料联合机以后，要求支柱的距离相应地加大；支柱距离扩大了，又要求顶板管理跟上去。这些问题不解决，攉煤运料联合机就不能使用，即使使用了，就必然出现冒顶等事故，影响生产的安全。所以，重大的技术革新项目普遍推广以后，必然会引起整个生产程序、工艺流程、技术管理和生产管理以及劳动组织等各个方面发生的一系列变化。这样，在新技术、新经验的推广使用过程中，不仅要及时解决它本身出现的一系列问题，还必须及时解决它身前身后，左邻右舍的问题，使上下左右构成一气，互相协调，共同提高。
    及时解决操作方面和保养维护方面的技术人材问题，也是十分重要的。正如有了千里马还必须有善于驾驭千里马的骑士一样，有了新技术还需要有掌握新技术的人材。从今天本报报道的阜新新丘煤矿十坑十八采煤段坚持使用攉煤机的新闻中就可以看到，由于操作技术不熟练，虽然机器效用很高，工人们使用起来却很费劲，这就要十分注意提高工人们的操作技术，使他们很快地掌握运用新技术、新经验的规律。事实上，也只有如此才能把新的技术和经验变成为群众所熟悉的东西，才能建立起一套必要的操作技术规程，保证大家都按规程办事。
    几个月来，攉煤机的推广和使用情况，给我们带来了十分有益的经验，这些经验概括起来是：任何新技术的推广，决不能满足于一般号召，一定要有具体指导；一定要在推广使用过程中不断改进，不断提高；在新技术、新经验的推广使用过程中，要迅速地使上下左右各个环节一定要相适应地跟上去，并且一定要注意培训掌握新技术的人材。当然，这些经验能不能为企业领导人员所接受，又在于有没有对待新事物的正确态度和观点，只有有了正确的观点作指导，才能敢于革新，取得胜利。上述这些，都是坚持推广使用新技术的关键；而领导人员采取什么样的态度使用新技术、新经验，则又是关键的关键。
