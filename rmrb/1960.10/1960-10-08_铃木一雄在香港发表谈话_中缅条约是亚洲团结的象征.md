Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th. Suzuki Kazuo, Permanent Director of the Japan-Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, told reporters on October 5th while passing through Hong Kong: The statement jointly issued by the twelve Japanese visiting delegations to China and eight Chinese people's organizations on October 3rd expressed the Japanese people's desire for friendship with China, and it will inevitably be supported by the Japanese people. Suzuki Kazuo just finished his visit to China. He said: "Only when the Japanese government implements the three political principles proposed by the Chinese side can the relationship between Japan and China be truly restored." He believes that the realization of economic and cultural exchanges between Japan and China is inseparable from the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle. As the Japanese people's struggle continues to move forward, the three principles can be gradually realized.

Suzuki Kazuo also pointed out that because the Ikeda government of Japan still pursues a policy of following the United States, it cannot lead Japan on a neutral path.

Speaking of the issue of solidarity among Asian and African countries, Suzuki Kazuo said: During the period around China's National Day, many delegations from Asian, African, and Latin American countries visited China, which is of great significance and impact on the solidarity of peace-loving people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. During this period, the signing of the China-Burma Border Treaty, the signing of the China-Guinea Friendship Treaty, the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement, and the Trade and Payment Agreement are symbols of Asian-African national solidarity.

    铃木一雄在香港发表谈话
    中缅条约是亚洲团结的象征
    新华社香港6日电　日本亚非团结委员会常务理事铃木一雄5日路过香港时对记者说：日本各界十二个访华代表团在10月3日与中国八个人民团体共同发表的声明表达了日本人民与中国友好的愿望，它必然受到日本人民的拥护和支持。铃木一雄刚结束了在中国的访问。他说：“只有日本政府贯彻中国方面所提出的政治三项原则，日中两国之间的关系才能真正恢复起来”。他认为，实现日中两国之间的经济和文化交流是与日本人民的反美爱国斗争分不开的，随着日本人民斗争的不断向前发展，三项原则才能得以逐步实现。
    铃木一雄还指出，由于日本池田政府到现在还执行着追随美国的政策，因此它不能把日本带向中立的道路。
    在谈到亚非国家之间的团结问题时，铃木一雄说：在中国国庆节前后期间，许多亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的代表团都到中国访问，这对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家爱好和平人民的团结来说是有很大的意义和影响的。在这期间，中国和缅甸边界条约的签订，中国和几内亚共和国友好条约、经济技术合作协定、贸易和支付协定的签订，是亚非民族团结的象征。
