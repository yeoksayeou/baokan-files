Xinhua News Agency, 3rd October: Burmese Prime Minister U Nu and his wife held a grand farewell banquet at the Great Hall of the People tonight.

At this emotional farewell banquet, Prime Minister U Nu and Premier Zhou Enlai spoke, both emphasizing the need to continue to consolidate and develop the "Pauk-Phaw"-like friendship between China and Burma. Prime Minister U Nu said that the friendship between China and Burma is lasting because it is built on solid rock. The edifice of Sino-Burmese friendship that we have jointly built will forever stand unpolluted and indestructible. Premier Zhou Enlai said that the friendship between the people of China and Burma can withstand the test of time, a conclusion drawn from the history of the past decade. Future practice will also prove this conclusion to be correct. These words of the two Prime Ministers were received with extremely warm applause from the more than one thousand people present at the reception.

The grand banquet began at 8:30 p.m. When Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Chairman Zhu De, and Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, and others, entered the banquet hall, the band played a welcoming song, and everyone stood up and applauded warmly for a long time.

Prime Minister U Nu spoke. He said: The people of Burma like to call the people of China "Pauk-Phaw," which means relatives. These two words represent the kinship of the Burmese people towards the Chinese people. Therefore, it is clear that this kinship between the people of Burma and China provides a solid foundation for their good-neighborly relations and fruitful cooperation in various areas of common concern.

Prime Minister U Nu pointed out that the traditional friendship between China and Burma has been strengthened by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, thus opening a new page in the relations between our two countries. This traditional friendship enabled us to resolve the long-standing border issue between our two countries to the satisfaction of both parties. The signing of the border treaty and the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression in January of this year have advanced our friendship by another stage. I think it can be said that the friendship and understanding between our two countries has now been firmly established.

Prime Minister U Nu said, I believe that the friendship between China and Burma is lasting because it is built on solid rock. Premier Zhou Enlai is the main architect in the construction of this friendship edifice. He will be long remembered in the hearts of our people. I believe and hope that the people of our two countries will continue to implement the policies we have implemented in the past few years in the future, and the edifice of Sino-Burmese friendship that we have jointly built will forever stand unpolluted and indestructible.

Premier Zhou then spoke. He said that the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty signed by the governments of China and Burma, which has attracted worldwide attention, has aroused widespread reactions in the world. The majority of people cheered for it, but a small handful of people were greatly disappointed. This shows that this treaty has produced and will continue to produce far-reaching effects. It is conducive to the cause of world peace and unfavorable to aggressors and expansionists. We have done something that is beneficial to China, beneficial to Burma, and beneficial to the world. This is the definitive judgment of fair world opinion, and it is something we should celebrate.

Premier Zhou said: The friendship between the people of China and Burma can withstand the test of time, a conclusion drawn from the history of the past decade. Future practice will also prove this conclusion to be correct.

Premier Zhou said that because General Ne Win signed the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression with our country during his visit to our country at the beginning of this year, and because Prime Minister U Nu concluded the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty during his visit to our country this time, the friendly relations between our two countries, which are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, will surely develop greatly with the passage of time in the future.

Premier Zhou praised Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win for their efforts to enhance Sino-Burmese friendship, and he asked Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win to convey the friendship of 650 million Chinese people to the kin-like Burmese people.

The speeches of Prime Minister U Nu and Premier Zhou Enlai were constantly interrupted by warm applause. After their speeches, the band played the national anthems of China and Burma respectively.

The grand banquet was filled with the "Pauk-Phaw"-like brotherly friendship between the people of China and Burma. During the banquet, the hosts and guests frequently raised their glasses to wish the Sino-Burmese friendship would last forever and to wish lasting peace in Asia and the world.

Also invited to attend tonight's banquet were Vice Premiers Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Luo Ruiqing, and Xi Zhongxun; Vice Chairmen Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Saifuddin, Cheng Qian, and Panchen Erdeni Choskyi Gyaltsen; President Xie Juezai; Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng; Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the CPPCC Li Siguang and Burhan; Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong and Fu Zuoyi; Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu; Chinese Ambassador to Burma Li Yimang; as well as responsible persons from various departments of state organs, various democratic parties, various people's organizations, and Beijing; senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; and well-known figures from all ethnic groups and all walks of life.

Members of the Burmese government delegation and other Burmese delegations, as well as Burmese Ambassador to China Kyao Winn, attended the banquet.

Envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries to China were also invited to attend the banquet. (Photo attached)

    吴努总理举行盛大告别宴会
    吴努总理说，中缅之间的友谊是持久的，因为它建立在牢固的磐石上
    周总理说，中缅人民友谊经得起考验，两国友好关系将大大发展起来
    新华社3日讯　缅甸联邦总理吴努和他的夫人今晚在人民大会堂举行盛大的告别宴会。
    吴努总理和周恩来总理在这个依依惜别的宴会上讲了话，一致强调要继续巩固和发展中缅两国“胞波”般的友谊。吴努总理说，中缅间的友谊是持久的，因为它建立在牢固的磐石上。我们共同建立起来的中缅友谊大厦将永远不受沾污和不可摧毁的屹立着。周恩来总理说，中缅两国人民的友谊，是经得起考验的，这是十年来历史所作的结论。今后的实践，也将证明这个结论是正确的。两国总理的这些话受到了出席招待会的一千多人极其热烈的欢迎。
    盛大的宴会在晚间八时三十分开始。当董必武副主席、朱德委员长和周恩来总理等，由吴努总理、奈温将军等陪同，步入宴会大厅的时候，乐队奏欢迎曲，全体起立，长时间地热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    吴努总理讲话。他说：缅甸人民喜欢称呼中国人民为“胞波”就是亲戚的意思。这两个字代表了缅甸人民对中国人民的亲戚情谊。因此，很明显，缅中两国人民彼此间的这种亲戚情谊给他们之间的睦邻关系和就共同关心的各个方面，进行卓有成效的合作提供了巩固的基础。
    吴努总理指出：传统的中缅友谊由于有了和平共处五项原则而得到了加强，因而在我们两国之间的关系上揭开了新的一页。这种传统的友谊使我们在双方满意的情况下，解决了我们两国之间长期存在的边界问题。边界条约的签订以及今年1月友好和互不侵犯条约的签订使我们的友谊向前推进了一个阶段。我想可以这样说，我们两国之间的友谊和谅解现在已经巩固地建立起来了。
    吴努总理说，我相信中缅间的友谊是持久的，因为它建立在牢固的磐石上。周恩来总理是这座友谊大厦建筑过程中的主要建筑师。他将长期记在我们人民的心中。我相信并期望我们两国人民在未来继续执行我们过去几年所执行的政策，我们共同建立起来的中缅友谊大厦将永远不受沾污和不可摧毁的屹立着。
    周总理接着讲话。他说，中缅两国政府签订的举世瞩目的中缅边界条约，在世界范围内引起了广泛的反应，多数人为之欢呼不已，但也有一小撮人大为扫兴。这说明，这个条约已经产生、而且还将继续产生深远的影响。它有利于世界和平事业，而不利于侵略扩张主义者。我们做了一件有利于中国、有利于缅甸、也有利于世界的事情。这是全世界公正舆论的定评，值得我们庆幸。
    周总理说：中缅两国人民的友谊，是经得起考验的，这是十年来历史所作的结论。今后的实践，也将证明这个结论是正确的。
    周总理说，由于奈温将军在今年年初访问我国时同我国签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约，由于吴努总理这次访问我国缔结了中缅边界条约，我们两国建立在和平共处五项原则基础上的友好关系，今后必将随着岁月的推移而大大地发展起来。
    周总理赞扬吴努总理阁下，奈温将军阁下对增进中缅友好所做的努力，他并且请吴努总理和奈温将军把六亿五千万中国人民的友谊，带给亲戚般的缅甸人民。
    吴努总理和周恩来总理的讲话都不断被热烈的掌声所打断，在他们讲话以后，乐队分别奏中国和缅甸两国的国歌。
    盛大的宴会充满了中缅两国人民“胞波”般的兄弟友情。席间，宾主频频举杯，祝中缅友谊万古长青，祝亚洲和世界的持久和平。
