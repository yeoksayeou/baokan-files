Golden Phoenix Mountain: A Pioneer Supporting Agriculture

Jin Fengshan, Deputy Director of the Xiangyang Prefectural Universal Machinery Factory in Hubei Province and a Communist Party member, has created and improved 31 types of new-style agricultural implements over the past six years. He has personally taught more than 7,000 farmers how to use and repair these new implements. He frequently goes to the countryside to impart technology, traveling to more than a dozen counties and cities in the Xiangyang and Jingzhou regions, and even trekking to rural areas in Yunnan Province.

This photo shows him explaining the structure and usage of the recently improved "Three-Row Automatic Wheat Drill" to agricultural implement operators from various communes at the Xiangyang New Agricultural Implement Craftsmen and Technicians Training Class.

    支援农业的尖兵金凤山
    湖北省襄阳专区通用机械厂副厂长、共产党员金凤山，六年来先后创制和改进了新式农具三十一种，亲自教会使用和修配新式农具的农民有七千多人。他经常下乡传授技术，足迹遍及襄阳、荆州等专区的十几个县、市，并曾远途跋涉到过云南省农村。
    这是他在襄阳新农具手和技术员训练班里，给各公社的农具手们讲解自己最近改进的“三行小麦自动条播器”的构造和使用方法。
