    Sichuan Fengjie Coal Mines and Iron Plants Use Coke Powder and Bituminous Coal to Produce High-Quality Coke
    Guangzhou Shijing Iron and Steel Plant Uses Recycled Coke to Supply Small Blast Furnaces with Good Results

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 6th: Coal mines and iron plants in Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, are making full use of coke powder and launching a mass movement to produce coke by mixing coke powder and bituminous coal, thereby increasing coke production. This year, the county has processed more than 2,000 tons of coke powder and produced more than 1,000 tons of coke. According to usage results, the quality of this coke is good, with high coking hardness and calorific value. The sulfur content is generally below 1.5%, and the ash content is generally around 26%, meeting the requirements for blast furnace ironmaking.

    Fengjie County is one of the key iron-producing areas in the Wanxian Special District of Sichuan Province. In the past two years, coal and iron plants throughout the county have accumulated a large amount of coke powder. A rough estimate from just ten coal mines and iron plants shows accumulated quantities of at least 5,000 tons. To meet the needs of steel production, the Fengjie County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a mixed coking experimental group, conducting experiments at the No. 3 and No. 4 Iron Plants respectively. The experimental group at the No. 3 Iron Plant first produced high-quality coke using 35% coke powder, 60% fine coal, and 5% lime. Subsequently, the County Committee convened a technical on-site meeting on mixed coking, summarizing a set of experiences in using coke powder to produce coke, and promoting the widespread blossoming of coke powder coking experience throughout the county. The Red Flag No. 2 coke oven in the Yanwan workshop of the No. 3 Iron Plant has now fully adopted mixed coking with bituminous coal and coke powder, saving eight to ten tons of fine coal per day.

    In the process of using coke powder and bituminous coal for coking, various factories and mines have been adapting to local conditions, based on transportation and existing production conditions, by building kilns next to the furnace and using the return trips of coke transport vehicles to bring the crushed coke powder back to the coking yard. Some factories have adopted the method of crushing coke at the coking yard, so that the coke powder does not leave the coking yard before being re-coked into coke lumps, reducing transportation volume and losses during transit. The No. 3 Iron Plant has built four "Pingxiang kilns" near the blast furnace for coking with coke powder, and a new transportation line has been built from the coke plant to the blast furnace, transporting coke powder and bituminous coal directly from the coke plant to the coke ovens beside the blast furnace, coking it on the spot, and supplying it for smelting.

    To further develop the mass movement of coke powder coking, the Fengjie County Committee of the Communist Party of China now stipulates the production task of coke powder coking at the same time as issuing the coke production plan to each factory every month.

    Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 6th: The workers of Guangzhou Shijing Iron and Steel Plant, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, use coke powder to refine recycled coke, opening up a new source of fuel for increasing steel production.

    The staff of Shijing Iron and Steel Plant started the experiment of refining recycled coke from coke powder in late August. With the specific help of factory leaders going deep into the front line of production, they adopted 35 formulas successively based on the principle of refining coke from white coal, and after repeated experiments, they finally achieved success. Now coke has been refined using nine formulas, and it has been proved by use that it can be used for iron smelting in small blast furnaces. Using this recycled coke for iron smelting is better than using coal balls, coke breeze and white coal. In particular, the recycled coke refined from Red Flag No. 2 coking furnace coke powder with fine and uniform particle size is of similar quality to the coke refined from Red Flag No. 2 coking furnace. A 4.66 cubic meter small blast furnace in this factory has been using this recycled coke to smelt iron since late August, production is generally normal, and the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace reaches 1.2 to 1.3. No additional equipment is required to produce this recycled coke, the operation is simple, and Red Flag No. 2 coking furnaces, Dongfeng furnaces or indigenous furnaces can be used for production. According to the estimation of Shijing Iron and Steel Plant, if all the existing coke powder is utilized, it can solve the fuel needs of a small blast furnace in this factory for about two months.

    利用焦粉　多炼焦炭　增产生铁
    四川奉节各煤矿铁厂用焦粉烟煤炼出高质量焦炭
    广州石井钢铁厂用再生焦供小高炉炼铁效果良好
    据新华社成都6日电　四川奉节县各煤矿和铁厂充分利用焦粉，大搞焦粉、烟煤混合炼焦的群众运动，增产焦炭。全县今年已处理焦粉两千多吨，共炼出焦炭一千多吨。根据使用结果，这种焦炭的质量良好，结焦硬度和发火力都较高，含硫量一般在1.5％以下，灰粉一般在26％左右，合乎高炉炼铁的要求。
    奉节县是四川省万县专区的重点产铁地区之一。全县各煤铁厂矿在近两年来都积存了大量的焦炭粉。仅十个煤矿、铁厂的概略统计，积存数量至少在五千吨以上。为了满足钢铁生产的需要，中共奉节县委组织了混合炼焦试验小组，分别在第三、第四铁厂进行试验。第三铁厂的试验小组用35％的焦粉，60％的精煤，5％的石灰，首先炼出了高质量的焦炭。接着，县委召开了混合炼焦的技术现场会议，总结出一套用焦粉炼焦炭的经验，促使焦粉炼焦经验在全县范围内普遍开花结果。第三铁厂岩湾车间的红旗二号焦窑，现在已经全部采用了烟煤、焦粉混合炼焦，每天节约精煤八吨到十吨。
    各厂矿在利用焦粉和烟煤炼焦过程中，都因地制宜地根据运输和现有生产条件，实行炉边建窑，利用运焦的回空车把碎焦粉运回焦场；有的厂采取在焦场碎焦的办法，使焦粉不出焦场再重炼成焦块，减少运量和在运途中的损失。第三铁厂在高炉附近建成了四个用焦粉炼焦的“萍乡窑”，新建了一条由焦厂到高炉的运输线，将焦粉和烟煤由焦厂直运到高炉边的焦窑，就地炼焦，就地供应冶炼。
    为了进一步开展焦粉炼焦的群众运动，中共奉节县委现在每月在给各厂下达焦炭生产计划的同时，都规定了焦粉炼焦的生产任务。
    本报广州6日电　广州市石井钢铁厂的职工，在增产节约运动中，利用焦炭粉炼成再生焦，为钢铁增产开辟了新的燃料来源。
    石井钢铁厂职工从8月下旬开始，就进行焦炭粉炼再生焦的试验。在厂领导干部深入生产第一线的具体帮助下，他们根据白煤炼成焦的原理，先后采用了三十五个配方，反复试验，终于获得了成功。现在已用九种配方炼成了焦炭，经使用证明，完全可供小高炉炼铁之用。用这种再生焦炭炼铁，比用煤球、焦碎和白煤丁效果更好。特别是用粒度细而均匀的红旗二号炼焦炉焦粉炼成的再生焦炭，其质量接近于红旗二号炼焦炉炼出的焦炭。这个厂的一座四点六六立方米小高炉，从8月下旬以来，就一直用这种再生焦炼铁，生产一般正常，高炉利用系数达到一点二至一点三。生产这种再生焦炭，不用增添什么设备，操作简易，红旗二号炼焦炉、东风炉或土炉，都可以生产。据石井钢铁厂的估计，如果把现存的焦粉全部利用起来，约可解决本厂一座小高炉两个月的燃料需要。
