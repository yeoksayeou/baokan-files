Prime Minister U Nu's Speech at the Farewell Banquet

Respected Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, Madame Premier, Friends:

Tonight, on the eve of our departure from the great and beautiful capital of the People's Republic of China, we feel extremely honored and exceptionally privileged to have the opportunity to host a banquet for our great friend, Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, and his esteemed colleagues. As we gather here for this farewell banquet, we feel both happy and sad. Happy because we are with our own relatives, whose warmth, care, and generous hospitality have deeply moved us. Sad because we know that we will soon be saying goodbye to our relatives.

The people of Burma like to call the people of China "Pauk-Phaw," which means relatives. The words "Pauk-Phaw" are not of recent origin, nor are they empty words. We inherited them from our ancestors. These two words represent the kinship of the Burmese people towards the Chinese people. Therefore, it is clear that this kinship between the people of Burma and China provides a solid foundation for good-neighborly relations and effective cooperation in various aspects of common concern between them.

Indeed, during the long years when the Burmese and Chinese people suffered under foreign rule, there was little effective contact between them, and therefore this kinship had few opportunities to develop and express itself. But it endured and stood the test of time. Once the Burmese and Chinese people regained full independence and were able to freely express their own will again, they quickly re-established close contact. In the initial years after our independence, both countries were preoccupied with domestic issues and were unable to make contact immediately. So, it was not until June 1954 that I had the honor of personally meeting Prime Minister Zhou Enlai. He visited Rangoon for two days at my invitation on his way back to Beijing from Geneva. We discussed issues related to promoting Sino-Burmese friendship and cooperation. We unanimously agreed that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should serve as the guiding principles for building the edifice of Sino-Burmese friendship and cooperation.

Traditional Sino-Burmese friendship was strengthened by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, thus opening a new page in the relationship between our two countries. This traditional friendship enabled us to resolve the long-standing boundary issue between our two countries to the satisfaction of both sides. Thus, what had not been accomplished throughout the history of our two countries has now been completed. Recently, the signing of the Boundary Treaty and the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression in January of this year have advanced our friendship to a new stage. I think it can be said that the friendship and understanding between our two countries have now been firmly established.

The visit of approximately three hundred Burmese people to Beijing this time is undoubtedly a large number, but compared to the number of people who wished to come but could not due to transportation difficulties, this number is still small. If transportation between Rangoon and Beijing were convenient, I believe that no less than three hundred thousand Burmese people would come here for this historically significant festival. We Burmese have a saying: "If the home is pleasant, it will attract guests." China's world-renowned hospitality and the traditional friendship between Burma and China are extremely attractive to our people.

As you know, the Burmese guests include politicians, businessmen, civil and military officials, actors and movie stars, journalists, athletes, and Burmese boxers. Indeed, they include people from all walks of life who have come here to participate in this festival at my suggestion, a suggestion that was gladly accepted by my friend Prime Minister Zhou Enlai. I brought them here to further consolidate and strengthen Sino-Burmese friendship. To establish genuine friendship between two countries, it is not enough to have an understanding only between the top leaders of the two countries; this understanding must have a broad base and must include people from all walks of life. That is why I brought so many people here. I apologize for any inconvenience that may have been caused to our hosts or for any shortcomings among our visitors.

The existence of friendship and harmony between two countries is taken for granted by many. But only when friendship is lost does one realize its value. It is like a room full of air; as long as everything is normal, people do not even notice that they are breathing, but once the air becomes polluted, one immediately feels the need for fresh air. What the world is suffering from today is a lack of friendship. Fear, suspicion, and hatred unfortunately fill the world. These are all destructive. Hatred causes destruction, while love and friendship create. I believe that the friendship between China and Burma is lasting because it is built on solid rock. Prime Minister Zhou Enlai is the chief architect in the construction of this edifice of friendship. He will be long remembered in the hearts of our people. I believe and expect that the people of our two countries will continue to implement the policies we have pursued in the past few years in the future, and that the edifice of Sino-Burmese friendship that we have jointly built will forever stand unblemished and indestructible.

Before I conclude this speech, I would like to express my deep gratitude for the warm, familial welcome and generous hospitality we have received during our stay in this beautiful city, which has deeply moved us. At the same time, I would also like to tell you that we eagerly look forward to reuniting on our National Day next year.

I ask everyone to join me in raising a glass

To the eternal friendship between the people of Burma and China,
To the prosperity of the People's Republic of China, and the happiness of its people,
To the great victory of the Five Principles of peaceful Coexistence,
For peace in Asia and the world,
To the health of Marshal Chen Yi and his wife, Marshal He Long and his wife, and other members of the Chinese government,
To the health of Prime Minister Zhou Enlai and Madame Deng Yingchao,
To the health of other Chinese distinguished guests,
To the health of the President of the People's Republic of China Liu Shaoqi,
To the health of Chairman Mao Zedong,
Cheers!

### 在吴努总理的告别宴会上  吴努总理的讲话

    在吴努总理的告别宴会上
    吴努总理的讲话尊敬的周恩来总理阁下，总理夫人，朋友们：
    今天晚上，在我们离开中华人民共和国伟大和美丽的首都的前夕，我们能够有机会做主人宴请我们伟大的朋友周恩来总理和他的尊贵的同事们，感到十分荣幸和格外地光荣。当我们相聚在这里参加告别宴会的时候，我们感到又是高兴又是难过。高兴的是我们和自己的亲戚在一起，他们的热情和关怀以及他们给予我们的慷慨殷勤的接待，真使我们感动万分。难过的是我们知道不久就将和我们的亲戚告别了。
    缅甸人民喜欢称呼中国人民为“胞波”就是亲戚的意思。“胞波”两字并不是最近才有的，也不是空话。这是我们从我们的祖先那里继承下来的。这两个字代表了缅甸人民对中国人民的亲戚情谊。因此，很明显，缅中两国人民彼此间的这种亲戚情谊给他们之间的睦邻关系和就共同关心的各个方面，进行卓有成效的合作提供了巩固的基础。
    确实，当缅甸人民和中国人民遭受外国统治漫长的日子里，他们之间很少有卓有成效的接触，因而这种亲戚情谊没有很多机会得到发展和表达。但是他们忍受了并且经受住了时间的考验。一当缅甸人民和中国人民重新获得完全独立，能够再次自由地表达他们自己的意志的时候，他们很快地重建了他们之间的紧密接触，在我们独立后的最初几年里两国都致力于国内问题，没有能够立即进行接触。所以，直到1954年6月我才荣幸地亲自和周恩来总理会面。他是应我的邀请，在从日内瓦回到北京的途中到仰光进行了两天的访问。我们讨论了有关促进中缅友好合作的问题。我们一致同意，和平共处五项原则应该作为建设中缅友好合作大厦的指导原则。
    传统的中缅友谊由于有了和平共处五项原则而得到了加强，因而在我们两国之间的关系上揭开了新的一页。这种传统的友谊使我们在双方满意的情况下，解决了我们两国之间长期存在的边界问题。这样，在我们两国的历史上一直没有完成的事情现在完成了。最近，边界条约的签订以及今年1月友好和互不侵犯条约的签订使我们的友谊向前推进了一个阶段。我想可以这样说，我们两国之间的友谊和谅解现在已经巩固地建立起来了。
    这次大约有三百位缅甸人访问北京，这个数字无疑是大的，但是和那些希望来而由于交通困难不能来的人数相比较，这个数字还是小的。如果仰光和北京之间的交通方便的话，我相信，不下三十万缅甸人会为这个具有历史意义的节日而来到这里。我们缅甸有这样一个说法：“如果家是令人愉快的，它就会吸引客人。”天下闻名的中国的好客和缅甸中国之间的传统友谊对我国人民具有极大的吸引力。
    你们都知道，缅甸的客人包括政治家、商人、文武官员、演员和电影明星、新闻工作者、运动员和缅甸的拳击家。的确，他们包括了各行各业的人士，他们来此参加这个节日原是我的建议，这项建议为我的朋友周恩来总理所欣然接受。我之所以让他们来是为了进一步巩固和加强中缅友谊。要建立两国间真正的友谊，只在两国最高领导人间达成谅解还是不够的，这种谅解必须有广泛的基础，必须包括各界的人士。这就是我带这么多的人来此的目的，对于可能给我们的主人带来了任何不方便的地方或者由于我们来人中有任何缺点，我在此表示歉意。
    两国之间存在着友好和睦，很多人以为是理所当然的。但是只有当失去了友谊的时候，才觉得友谊的可贵。它好比一间充满了空气的屋子，只要一切都是正常，人们甚至不会注意到自己在呼吸，但一旦空气变成污浊了，马上就会感到新鲜空气的需要。今天世界所遭受到的就是缺乏友谊。恐惧、猜疑和仇恨不幸地充塞人间。这些都是破坏性的。仇恨会造成破坏，而爱与友谊却在创造。我相信中缅间的友谊是持久的，因为它建立在牢固的磐石上。周恩来总理是这座友谊大厦建筑过程中的主要建筑师。他将长期记在我们人民的心中。我相信并期望我们两国人民在未来继续执行我们过去几年所执行的政策，我们共同建立起来的中缅友谊大厦将永远不受沾污和不可摧毁的屹立着。
    在我结束这个讲话之前，我要说我们在这个美丽的城市里逗留期间所受到的热烈的亲戚般的欢迎和慷慨而殷勤的接待使我们深为感动，对此，我要表示深切的感谢。同时我也要告诉你们，我们殷切地期待着明年一日我国国庆时我们再次团聚。
    我请大家和我一起举杯
    为缅中两国人民间的永恒的友谊，
    为中华人民共和国的繁荣和人民的幸福，
    为和平共处五项原则的伟大胜利，
    为亚洲和世界和平，
    为陈毅元帅和夫人，贺龙元帅和夫人以及中国政府的其他成员的健康，
    为周恩来总理阁下和邓颖超夫人的健康，
    为其他中国贵宾的健康，
    为中华人民共和国主席刘少奇阁下的健康，
    为毛泽东主席阁下的健康，
    干杯！
