Lujiang, October 30 (Reported by this newspaper) – Cadres at the county, commune, and brigade levels in Lujiang County, Anhui Province, who have been transferred to lower levels, are focusing on canteen work while participating in labor and leading production, making comprehensive and detailed arrangements for commune members' lives, and greatly promoting the current Three Autumn campaigns.

The Lujiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the consolidation and improvement of rural canteens. This spring, the County Committee summarized the experience of secretaries going down to the kitchen and running experimental canteen plots last year, and organized more than 1,500 cadres at the brigade level and above to work as managers or cooks in canteens in batches, which played a significant role in promoting the operation of canteens. Recently, in response to the new situation of a large number of cadres being transferred to the front lines of production, the County Committee decided to assign the task of improving canteen work to the transferred cadres, requiring cadres to eat in the canteen of the team where they work, and contract to run the canteen well. Currently, all 2,339 transferred cadres in the county have contracted canteens. At the same time, the office canteens of the eight communes and the 185 brigade canteens have all been abolished.

Because cadres at all levels who have been transferred to lower levels insist on eating at the same table as commune members, commune members can report situations and make suggestions to the cadres at any time, which is conducive to solving problems in a timely manner. Li Futang, Deputy Secretary of the County Discipline Inspection Committee, who was transferred to the Guiyuan Brigade of Leqiao Commune to serve as the General Branch Secretary, found that the canteen did not grow enough vegetables when he was eating at the Yagang Canteen. He personally led the cooks to the fields to fight drought and plant vegetables. Deng Yingshan, Finance and Trade Minister of Leqiao Commune, ate at the Xincun Canteen in Sanqiao Brigade. According to the requirements of the commune members, he implemented the "meal hanging card method," which effectively promoted planned and economical use of grain.

Cadres transferred to lower levels also help canteens develop their family business production. Jiang Xingfa, Deputy Secretary of the Ketan Commune Party Committee, actively helped the Datun Brigade Gonghe Canteen establish a non-staple food production base after contracting to be responsible for the canteen. He took the lead in working hard to grow vegetables and raise pigs, thus making the canteen's family fortune increasingly abundant. It has now planted 92 mu of vegetables, raised 22 pigs, raised 584 domestic fowl, and raised 22,000 fish. At present, all 1,981 rural canteens in the county have planted a total of 89,463 mu of vegetables and raised 27,300 pigs. More than 90% of the canteens have reached the "five-good" standards of "good planned use of grain, good family business production, good cleanliness and hygiene, good management, and good collective welfare undertakings centered on the canteen." The broad masses of commune members enthusiastically call the cadres "good housekeepers" and praise the canteens as "happiness halls" and "wish-fulfilling stoves."

Cadres transferred to lower levels also continuously strengthen political and ideological education for canteen managers and cooks. Zhang Xianxin, member of the Standing Committee of the County Committee and Deputy County Head, who was transferred to the Dasunzhuang Canteen of the Dongyue Brigade of Shengqiao Commune, helps the cooks to weigh rice, wash vegetables, serve meals, and plant vegetables every day, and conducts ideological education for canteen managers and cooks through conversations and making friends, which deeply moves the canteen staff. Now, the rural canteens in the county have a catering team of more than 20,000 people with red hearts and skillful hands.

The continuous improvement of canteen work has made all commune members satisfied. During the Three Autumn campaigns, the attendance rate has increased by an average of 20% compared with the original, and the work efficiency has increased by 35%. The management of late autumn crops and autumn planting work have all jumped to the first place in the county.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 29th – Songjiang County, Shanghai, has entered the busy season of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting. While focusing on the Three Autumn productions, the Chengbei People's Commune Party Committee has taken vigorous measures to further improve the canteens, ensure that the food is hot, the dishes are sufficient, and the boiled water is fully supplied, so that the commune members can eat well and rest well, and effectively support production.

In leading production, the Chengbei Commune Party Committee has always been concerned about the lives of commune members, and has regarded arranging the lives of commune members as an important aspect of mobilizing the labor enthusiasm of the masses, developing production, and promoting the construction of the commune. Before the start of the "Three Autumns," the Commune Party Committee and the Party branches of various production teams successively convened meetings of canteen cadres and symposiums for cooks to explain the great role of doing a good job in logistics for strengthening the front lines of agricultural production. In order to help canteen staff improve their professional level, the Commune helped the canteens establish a regular inspection and evaluation system, and held several on-site meetings to exchange advanced experience in running canteens and cooking. Through the above work, the ideological understanding and professional level of the canteen staff have been universally improved, and they are actively serving the Three Autumn campaigns.

On the eve of the "Three Autumns," cadres at all levels in the commune, under the leadership of the Party Committee, took the lead in going deep into the canteens, conscientiously implemented the measures of the Party Committee to focus on life, and earnestly solved specific problems one by one. Chen Guofan, Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, found that watering, fertilizing, and pest control were carried out in three times, which had the disadvantages of soil hardening, low fertilizer efficiency, and incomplete pest control in the process of grasping the field management of canteen vegetables and preparing vegetables for the "Three Autumns." He experimented with the cadres of the Fanrong Production Team to combine these three processes into one, which resulted in saving manpower and man-hours, and also made the vegetables grow faster and better. The green vegetables of this production team originally took thirty days to eat, but now they can be eaten in twenty-five days, and because the pest control is thorough, the taste of the green vegetables is also good. Leading cadres going deep into the canteens has also greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the cooks and encouraged the commune members to love the canteens even more.

    干部包干办食堂搞好生活推进生产
    庐江下放干部和社员同桌吃饭，带头建立家底，培养炊事队伍
    松江城北公社采取多种方法组织后勤人员积极支援三秋战线
    本报合肥30日电　安徽庐江县、社、大队三级下放干部，在参加劳动领导生产的同时，大抓食堂工作，全面细致地安排社员生活，大大地促进了当前的三秋工作。
    中共庐江县委十分重视农村食堂的巩固和提高工作。今春，县委总结了去年书记下厨房、大办食堂试验田的经验，组织大队以上各级干部一千五百多人，分批到食堂去当管理员或炊事员，对办好食堂曾起了很大的促进作用。最近，县委针对当前大批干部下放到生产第一线的新形势，决定把改进食堂工作的任务交给下放干部，要求干部在哪一个队劳动，就在哪个食堂吃饭，包干把食堂办好。现在全县下放干部二千三百三十九名，都各自包了食堂。与此同时，八个公社的机关食堂和一百八十五个大队食堂，也都全部撤消。
    由于各级下放干部坚持和社员同桌吃饭，社员都能随时向干部反映情况和提出意见，有利于及时解决问题。县监委副书记李福堂下放在乐桥公社桂元大队担任总支书记，他在牙岗食堂吃饭，发现食堂菜种得不多，就亲自带领炊事员下地抗旱种菜。乐桥公社财贸部长邓英善在三桥大队新村食堂吃饭，根据社员的要求，实行了“用饭挂牌法”，有效地促进了计划用粮节约用粮。
    各级下放干部还帮助食堂发展家底生产。柯坦公社党委副书记江兴法，包干负责大屯大队共和食堂以后，积极帮助食堂建立副食品生产基地，带头苦干，大搞种菜养猪，因而使食堂家底日益雄厚起来。现已种菜九十二亩，养猪二十二头，养家禽五百八十四只，养鱼两万二千尾。现在，全县一千九百八十一个农村食堂，共种蔬菜八万九千四百六十三亩，养猪二万七千三百头，90％以上的食堂达到了
  “计划用粮好，家底生产好，清洁卫生好，经营管理好，以食堂为中心的集体福利事业办得好”的“五好”标准。广大社员热情地叫干部为“好管家”，称赞食堂是“幸福堂”、“如意灶”。
    下放干部还不断加强对食堂管理员、炊事员的政治思想教育。下放在圣桥公社东岳大队大孙庄食堂的县委常委、副县长张先信，每天都帮助炊事员秤米、洗菜、打饭、种菜，并通过谈心、交朋友等方式，对食堂管理员和炊事员进行思想教育，使食堂工作人员深受感动。现在全县农村食堂有了一支两万多人的心红手巧的炊事队伍。
    食堂工作不断改进，使社员人人满意，三秋运动中，出勤率平均比原来提高20％，工效提高35％，晚秋作物管理和秋种工作都跃居全县第一位。
    据新华社上海29日电　上海市松江县秋收、秋耕、秋种已经进入大忙阶段。这个县城北人民公社党委在狠抓三秋生产的同时，采取有力措施，进一步办好食堂，保证饭热菜足、开水充分供应，使社员们吃好、休息好，有力地支援了生产。
    城北公社党委在领导生产中，一贯关心社员生活，把安排好社员生活作为调动群众劳动积极性，发展生产和推进公社建设的一个重要方面。“三秋”开始前，公社党委和各生产队党支部就先后召开了食堂干部会议和炊事员座谈会，讲解了做好后勤工作对于加强农业生产第一线的巨大作用；为了帮助食堂工作人员提高业务水平，公社帮助食堂建立了定期检查评比制度，数次举行现场会议，交流办好食堂和做饭、烧菜的先进经验。通过以上工作，食堂工作人员的思想认识和业务水平都有了普遍提高，积极为三秋战线服务。
    “三秋”前夕，全社各级干部都在党委领导下，带头深入食堂，认真贯彻党委抓好生活的措施，切切实实地解决一个个的具体问题。公社党委副书记陈国藩在抓食堂蔬菜田间管理，为“三秋”备菜过程中，发现浇水、施肥、除虫分三次进行有泥土硬结、肥效不高、除虫不彻底等缺点，就与繁荣生产队干部一起试验，把这三道工序合并为一道，结果节约了人力和工时，还使蔬菜长得又快又好。这个生产队的青菜本来要三十天才能吃，现在二十五天可吃，而且由于除虫彻底，青菜的味道也好。领导干部深入食堂，也大大激发了炊事员的干劲，鼓舞社员们更加热爱食堂。
