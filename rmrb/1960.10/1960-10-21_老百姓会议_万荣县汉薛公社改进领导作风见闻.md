    People's Meeting
    ——A Glimpse of Improved Leadership Style in Hanxue People's Commune, Wanrong County
    By Our Reporters Sha Yin, Shao Tang
    Just arriving at the Hanxue People's Commune in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, we heard people say that the commune's "People's Meeting" was going quite well. After careful investigation, it turned out to be like this: the Hanxue People's Commune held a total of eleven meetings for cadres above the production team leader level this year. These eleven three-level cadre conferences added up to less than forty hours. The longest meeting was no more than four hours, and the shortest only two hours. Moreover, not a single meeting was held sitting in a conference room. Because the meetings were held less frequently, held well, and took less time, the management district and production team cadres supported them very much. They gave the cadre conferences convened by the commune a lot of names: some called them "flying meetings," some called them "treasure-seeking meetings," some called them "duet performances." Later, gradually everyone agreed to call them "People's Meetings." The meaning is that these meetings do not have lengthy reports, just like the masses discussing something, getting straight to the point, saying what to do, learning what is lacking, giving what is needed, and handling everything solidly and efficiently.
    "Duet Performance"
    We didn't have time to carefully investigate when the "People's Meeting" of the Hanxue People's Commune started. However, it was only after the livestock breeding work "duet performance" at the beginning of spring that it was recognized by the cadres above and below.
    Here's what happened at the time: In March, spring plowing had already begun. Ma Debao, the first secretary of the commune's Party committee, went to various production teams to inspect the work. He ran to the Gaojiazhuang management district in the dark and happened to see the commune members driving the cattle back after plowing. He looked closely and saw that the large yellow cattle were all very thin. The next day, he ran to the Yangli management district and looked at the cattle in the field. The large yellow cattle were even thinner than those in Gaojiazhuang. This made Old Ma anxious. He thought: Spring plowing has just begun, and the livestock are already so thin, how will the work be done later? Unexpectedly, when he returned to the commune and discussed it with the Party committee members, some people didn't think it was a problem, saying "Our Hanxue has hard land and difficult roads, the livestock feed is as much as other communes, but it just can't hold up." The meaning was: Hanxue's livestock should be a little thinner than other communes. Old Ma felt very uncomfortable when he heard this, but he didn't say anything more. The next day, he got up and ran to the Xiecungou management district. The Xiecungou management district is on the eastern hillside. If you say the road is difficult to walk, it is one of the best in the commune; if you say the land is hard, it rains in the morning and dries up in the afternoon so that the plow cannot go down. However, the livestock in this management district were all well-fed and plump, nine mares gave birth to nine foals, and forty-some cows gave birth to forty-some calves. Having found this typical example, it was easier to talk. Obviously, hard roads are not the reason for not raising livestock well. The real reason for not raising livestock well must be found in the leadership's thinking and feeding management. So he ran back and discussed it with everyone again. The Party committee members didn't have anything to say, and decided to hold a livestock breeding work meeting to solve the problem.
    Because they wanted to solve the problem quickly and well, the meeting was held like this: The Xiecungou management district and the Yangli management district both brought their livestock to the Hanxue management district, and then called all the cadres and feeders of the entire commune to evaluate them. Everyone saw that Xiecungou managed well and Yangli's livestock was not well-raised, so they all wanted the cadres of the Xiecungou management district to introduce their feeding experience. The agricultural section chief of the Xiecungou management district briefly introduced their experience in implementing "cadre contracting for troughs" and improving feeding. Everyone understood as soon as they heard it. One said that they would raise the livestock as well as Xiecungou in two months; another said that they would not only raise them well, but also match them well. Even the secretary of the Yangli branch made a self-criticism and proposed ways to improve feeding management. Old Ma saw that everyone's thinking and emotions had changed, and said that since everyone was willing to raise the livestock like Xiecungou, the commune Party committee accepted everyone's opinion and called on all the cadres and feeders of the commune to immediately launch a competition to raise large livestock well in the spring plowing production campaign. The meeting ended like this, only lasting three hours, but everyone's impression was very deep, and Xiecungou's experience was immediately promoted throughout the commune. In a few months, the large livestock of the entire commune were well-fed, and the mating work was carried out well and quickly. Originally, the commune's livestock breeding was the famous "Old Seventh" in Wanrong County (there are a total of seven communes in this county), but now it has won the second place.
    "Treasure Seeking"
    After the wheat harvest, the twenty-two management districts of the Hanxue People's Commune immediately launched a mass movement to summarize the experience of increasing wheat production and strive for an even greater harvest next year. At this juncture, the county party committee proposed thirty-two measures to the commune party committees to strive for a large increase in agricultural production. The commune party committee studied it and felt that if these thirty-two articles were implemented all at once, nothing would be done well. After discussing it back and forth, there was only one way, which was to seize the key and make a big deal out of it. But what was the key? The Party committee charged Ma Debao to find it.
    Ma Debao accepted the task and ran to several management districts in a row, but couldn't figure it out. Later, he heard that Xiecungou had four mu of wheat, which yielded 400 jin per mu this year, so he went there. He held meetings, visited, and observed on the spot, and found one reason - soil and water conservation was done well. These four mu of land were well-renovated. The heavy rain in August last year didn't break the mouth, the soil wasn't washed away, and this year the fertilization, processing, and other land plots were the same, but the grain produced was two or three times more. However, land leveling requires labor. He calculated that replanting, tilling, cotton management, and the big and small autumn harvests would require at least 1,955,000 workdays, while the commune's entire frontline labor force could only do 1,660,000 workdays. What to do? After thinking about it, he decided to let the Xiecungou management district try it out. The cadres of the management district accepted this task and first concentrated their labor on autumn field management to fight an annihilation war; turning around to level the land, in four days, the entire district renovated more than 500 mu of land. It seemed that the labor problem was not difficult to solve. So, on August 2nd, all the cadres of the management districts and production teams of the entire commune went to the four mu of high-yielding land in Xiecungou to hold a meeting early in the morning. At that time, according to the notice, it was to implement the instructions of the county party committee, but unexpectedly, at the beginning of the meeting, Li Tailai, the captain of the fourth production team of the Xiecungou management district, first introduced the experience of producing 400 jin per mu on four mu of land; then, Guo Dianyou, the secretary of the Xiecungou management district branch, introduced how to concentrate superior forces to level the land. These two reports attracted everyone, and those who originally thought that leveling the land was useless and couldn't be taken care of due to lack of labor also became active. At this time, Old Ma asked everyone to discuss it and see if it would work? Was this the key to increasing wheat production? Everyone clamored and the problem became clearer: The Hanxue People's Commune is a hilly area, and the fields are almost all on the mountainsides. If the land can be leveled well, it can guarantee four things: water conservation, soil conservation, fertilizer conservation, and also kill insects and ensure a good harvest. This is naturally a great thing. Old Ma saw that everyone said it was okay, and said: "Then let's do it this way. The county party committee instructed us to take the most effective measures to ensure increased wheat production. We will implement the instructions of the county party committee and focus on soil and water conservation." Everyone understood that this was the case and said, "Good feeling, this meeting has both implemented the instructions of the county party committee and allowed everyone to seek treasure. Let's hold this 'treasure-seeking meeting' in the future." Sure enough, after the meeting was held on August 2nd, a large-scale land leveling was launched on August 3rd. More than 3,000 laborers were mobilized throughout the commune, and they worked for more than 20 days at a stretch, not only leveling the 57,000 mu of regular wheat fields, but also repairing more than 20,000 mu of wheat fields ready for replanting.
    "Opening Minds"
    This year, the weather was dry, and the late autumn crops emerged late. By the "End of Heat," the corn had not yet tasseled, and the mung beans had not yet grown well. Because of this, the commune members talked a lot, some said: There is no hope for the autumn harvest this year. Some said: This year's autumn lost the seeds and earned firewood. More people simply said: If the head doesn't show up at the End of Heat, it's better to cut it down and feed it to the cattle! That being said, although everyone didn't cut down the crops, the enthusiasm for processing became smaller and smaller, and some places simply hung up their hoes.
    The commune members felt uncomfortable, and the cadres also felt that the burden was quite heavy. The commune party committee required all party committee members to find some way to solve the problem. Seven secretaries divided into seven areas and went deep into the management districts and production teams.
    Zhai Yongfu, the party committee secretary and commune director, went straight to the Manyukou management district, worked with the commune members, and began to learn from the masters. One day, he worked with two old commune members, and when they talked about the autumn crop management this year, he asked Zhang Qingyuan, an old man: "Old Zhang, some people say that the autumn crops haven't tasseled at the End of Heat this year, and they want to cut them down. Do you think that's right?" Zhang Qingyuan thought for a while and said: "Director Zhai, it's not right to cut them down. There's an old saying: If the head shows up within ten days of the End of Heat, there will be at least an 80% harvest! One year, this area was so dry that we couldn't plant anything. Later, we planted it, but it didn't tassel. Zhang Chengwa plowed it, and didn't harvest anything. My five mu of corn and three mu of millet were not plowed, but hoeed and fertilized, and in the end, each mu yielded 120 jin." Words are the keys to opening hearts. After Zhang Lao Han finished speaking, Zhai Yongfu quickly went to find Zhang Chengwa. After understanding, there was indeed such a thing. He was very happy and gathered the cadres and commune members for a symposium in the evening, and asked the old man to talk about it. Once he spoke, everyone understood and decided to make a big fuss about late autumn processing. In a few days, more than 2,000 mu of autumn fields were universally hoeed once, fertilized once, and the corn was also earthed up. Old Zhai reported this situation to Ma Debao, and Ma Debao was very happy when he heard it, and said: "Good, let everyone see and open their minds!" So, on August 12th, the commune issued a notice to each management district and production team, asking the cadres to evaluate whether the crops in the Manyukou management district were growing well.
    Early in the morning on August 13th, the cadres of each management district rode their bicycles to Manyukou. Along the way, it was seen that the autumn crops in Manyukou were growing well, dark green and strong. The corn had tasseled, and the mung beans had pods. Everyone was surprised that the late autumn crops here were better than those in their own management districts, and they wanted to ask for the truth. Unexpectedly, Old Zhai said: "Don't worry, ask after you've seen it well." When everyone who came to the meeting was there, Old Zhai asked everyone, how was the evaluation? Everyone said it was good, but they didn't know how it was done. At this time, Zhai Yongfu introduced Zhang Qingyuan and Zhang Chengwa to everyone. These two old men told their experiences, and then the secretary of the Manyukou management district branch introduced the experience of organizing autumn field processing. In this way, everyone understood that processing can promote crop growth. There was a commotion at the meeting, this one said they had opened their eyes, and that one said they had opened their minds, and they were all anxious to go back and process the late autumn crops. At this time, Old Zhai stopped everyone again. He said: "Don't worry, everyone, there are still problems. The old saying goes, late autumn can't withstand the White Dew wind. Seeing that White Dew is coming, and with another round of work, the White Dew wind blows, the corn leaves dry, and the mung beans turn gray, what should we do?" Yes! Everyone was stunned. At this time, experienced cadres remembered: Crops can't withstand the White Dew wind because the seedlings are not strong. If the seedlings are strong, they will still live! "Right!", everyone agreed with this opinion. At this time, Old Zhai asked everyone if there were any other problems? Everyone said no. Old Zhai said on behalf of the commune party committee: "Good, all the autumn fields will be universally hoeed once, universally fertilized once, and all the corn will be earthed up. This is the decision of the commune party committee. The slogan is: At the beginning of Autumn, refuel more." One after another for more than two hours, everyone opened their minds and left with confidence.
    The day after the meeting, the late autumn processing movement was launched throughout the commune. There were all kinds of slogans, such as "hoe grass if there is grass, conserve moisture if there is no grass", "one hoe and one fertilizer, drive out big ears". In seven days, the topsoil of 40,000 mu of corn was turned over, and fertilizer was universally applied and the soil was earthed up. This was immediately effective, the seedlings were all changing for the better, and the ears were all popping out evenly. September 7th was "White Dew". Although there was a continuous four days of strong winds, which blew a layer of persimmons, the corn was still green and strong, like middle-aged people, growing sturdily.
    Evaluation
    More than nine months have passed this year. In these nine months, the Hanxue People's Commune Party Committee has held eleven commune-wide cadre meetings to arrange the work of livestock management, canteen management, summer harvest, land leveling, and autumn field management solidly. Not a single meeting was delayed by a day, and not a single meeting was just a formality. They excellently used the working method of coming from the masses and going to the masses to hold meetings, so that the cadres of the management districts and production teams had enough time to do their work down-to-earth. Because of this, when it comes to holding meetings, the cadres below always say: "This is our commune's new style. In the past, the secretaries worked hard to make reports for half a day, and we couldn't remember two sentences. We couldn't get the treasure, so how could we use it? Now it's different. We can see, touch, and pick up the instructions from above at the meeting. Of course, if there is treasure, we can bring it back."

    老百姓会议
    ——万荣县汉薛公社改进领导作风见闻
    本报记者　莎荫　邵棠
    刚到山西省万荣县汉薛公社，就听人说，这个公社的“老百姓会议”开得挺不错。后来仔细访问了一下，原来是这么回事：汉薛公社今年满共开过十一次生产小队长以上的干部会议。这十一次三级干部大会，加起来还没用四十个小时。每次会议最长不过四小时，最短的只开两小时。而且没有一次会议是坐在会议室开的。因为会议开得少，开得好，开得时间短，管理区、生产队的干部们很拥护，他们给公社召开的干部大会起了一大堆名字：有的说是“飞行会议”，有的说是“讨宝会议”，有的说是“对台戏”，后来，慢慢地大家的说法一致起来了，叫它是“老百姓会议”。意思是说，这种会议没有长篇大论的报告，就像群众商量什么事情，开门见山，做什说什，短什学什，要什给什，什事儿都办得扎扎实实，俐俐落落。
    “对台戏”
    汉薛公社的“老百姓会议”始于何年何月，我们没有来得及仔细考究。不过，开春的那场大牲畜饲养工作“对台戏”以后，才被上上下下的干部们承认了。
    当时是这么回事：3月间，春耕已经开始了，公社党委第一书记马德保到各生产队去检查工作，摸黑跑到高家庄管理区，正碰到犁地的社员赶着牛回来，他细细一看，大黄牛个个都瘦得很。第二天，又跑到杨李管理区，到地里看了看，大黄牛比高家庄的还瘦。这一下，老马急了，心想：现在春耕刚刚开始，牲口就瘦成这个样，以后的活儿咋搞？想不到回公社和党委委员们一商量，有的人还觉得不是个问题，说什么“咱汉薛地硬路难走，牲口的料和别的公社一样多，就顶不下来。”意思是说：汉薛的牲口就该比别的公社瘦一点。老马一听很不舒服，可也没有再说什么。第二天爬起来就跑到薛村沟管理区。薛村沟管理区在东山坡上，要说路难走，是公社数一数二的；要说地硬，早上落雨，后晌就干巴得下不了犁。可是，这个管理区的牲口个个吃得滚瓜流油，九匹母马，生了九个子，四十几个母牛生了四十几个牛犊。摸到这个典型，话就好说了。显然，硬路难走，不是养不好牲口的原因，养不好牲口的真正原因得从领导思想和饲养管理方面去找。于是他跑回来又和大家商量，党委委员们也没什么说的了，决定开一次牲畜饲养工作会议，把问题解决一下。
    因为想把问题解决得快些好些，会议是这么开的：薛村沟管理区和杨李管理区都把牲口牵到汉薛管理区，然后把全公社的干部、饲养员叫来给评比。大家一看，都说薛村沟管得好，杨李的牲口养得不好，就纷纷地要薛村沟管理区的干部介绍饲养经验。薛村沟管理区的农业股长就简单扼要地给大家介绍了他们实行“干部包槽”，改进饲养的经验。大家一听，心里亮了。这家说，两个月把牲口养得赶上薛村沟；那家说既要养好，还要配好种。连杨李的支部书记也作了检查，提出了改进饲养管理的办法。老马见大家的思想情绪转过来了，就说既然大家都愿意把牲口养得像薛村沟一样，公社党委接受大家的意见，号召全社干部、饲养员，在春耕生产运动中立即开展一个养好大牲口的竞赛运动。会议就这么结束了，满共不过开了三小时，可大家的印象十分深，薛村沟的经验一下就在全公社推广了。几个月工夫，全公社大牲畜就喂起来了，配种工作也进行得又好又快。原来，这个公社的牲畜饲养是万荣县有名的“老第七”（这个县一共有七个公社），现在夺得了亚军。
    “讨宝”
    麦收罢，汉薛公社二十二个管理区立即掀起一个总结小麦增产经验，力争来年更大丰收的群众运动。正在这个节骨眼上，县委向各个公社党委提出了力争农业大增产的三十二条措施。公社党委研究了一下，觉得：要把这三十二条一齐贯彻下去，就会样样搞不好。讨论来讨论去，只有一条办法，就是抓住关键大做文章。可是，什么是关键呢？党委责成马德保去找。
    马德保接受了任务，一连跑了好几个管理区，没弄出个头绪来。后来听说薛村沟有四亩小麦，今年亩产达到四百斤，他就跑去了。开会、访问、实地观察，找出了一条原因——水土保持搞得好。这四亩地整修得好，去年8月那场大雨没冲开口，土没冲走，今年施肥、加工和别的地块一样，打的粮食却多上两三倍。可是，要整地，得花劳力。他算了一笔账：复播、整茬、棉花管理、大小秋收，满打满算至少也要一百九十五万五千多个工，而当时公社所有第一线的劳力也不过做一百六十六万多个工。怎么办？想来想去，决定让薛村沟管理区试一试。管理区的干部们接受了这个任务后，先把劳力集中在秋田管理上，打个歼灭战；扭回头来整地，四天工夫，全区修出了五百多亩地。看来，劳力问题不难解决。于是，在8月2日这天，全公社的管理区、生产队的干部们一早就到薛村沟的四亩丰产地里开会。当时，照通知是贯彻执行县委的指示，不想会议一开始，先是薛村沟管理区第四生产队队长李太来介绍四亩地亩产四百斤的经验；接着，又是薛村沟管理区支部书记郭殿有介绍怎样集中优势兵力整地。这两个报告可把大家吸引住了，原来认为整地不顶事，没劳力顾不过来的人，也活动起来了。这时，老马就让大家讨论讨论，看到底行不行？这么办是不是抓住增产小麦的关键？大家七嘴八舌地一嚷嚷，问题也就更明白了：汉薛公社是丘陵山区，田地几乎都在山坡上，能把地整好，就能四保：保水、保土、保肥，还能灭虫保收，这自然是件大好事。老马见大家说行，就说：“那就这么办，县委指示我们要采取最有效的措施保证小麦增产。我们执行县委的指示，就要抓水土保持。”大家一听，原来是这么回事，就说开了：“敢情好，这会是又贯彻了县委的指示，又让大家取宝，以后就开这‘讨宝会’吧”果然，8月2日开了会，8月3日就来了个大整地，全公社上马的劳力就有三千多人，一气搞了二十多天，不光把五万七千亩正茬麦田整了出来，还修理了两万来亩准备回茬的麦田。
    “开脑筋”
    今年天旱，晚秋作物出土迟，到“处暑”了，玉茭还没冒穗，绿豆还没有长好荚。为这事，社员们议论纷纷，有的说：今年秋收没指望了。有的说：今年的秋，丢了种籽，赚了柴火。更多人干脆说：处暑不露头，不如割的喂了牛！说是说，大家虽没割倒庄稼，可是加工的劲头越来越小，有的地方干脆把锄头挂起来了。
    社员心里不好受，干部也觉得担子挺重。公社党委就要求全体党委委员，一定要找出点办法来。七个书记分了七片，深入到管理区、生产队去了。
    党委书记兼公社主任翟永福，一竿子扎到漫峪口管理区，一边和社员劳动，一边拜师学起艺来了。一天，他和两个老社员一起干活，说起今年秋禾管理的事来，他就问张庆元老汉：“老张，有人说今年秋禾处暑还没露头，要割哩。你说对不对？”张庆元一听，想了想，说：“翟主任，割了可不对啊，古人有句话：处暑十天露了头，最低还有八成收！有年，咱这一带也是旱得种不下，后来种下了，又不出穗。张成娃犁了，没收下东西。我的五亩玉茭、三亩谷都没犁，又锄又上粪，到底一亩还打了一百二十斤。”话是开心的钥匙，张老汉说完，翟永福就赶快去找张成娃，一了解，果然有这么回事。他可乐了，晚上，就召集干部、社员开了个座谈会，让这老人说了说。一说，大家心里亮堂了，决定大闹晚秋加工。几天工夫，就把两千多亩秋田，普遍锄了一次，追了一次肥，还给玉茭培了土。老翟把这一情况给马德保汇报了，马德保一听，很高兴，说：“好吆，让大家都看，开开脑筋！”于是，8月12日，公社给各管理区、生产队下了个通知，要干部们到漫峪口管理区评评庄稼长得好不好。
    8月13日一早，各管理区的干部骑着自行车就跑到了漫峪口。沿路看来，数漫峪口的秋禾长得好，黑绿、壮实，玉茭吐了绒，绿豆现了荚。都奇怪这里的晚秋比自己管理区的好，就想问个水落石出。不想老翟说：“别急，看好后再问。”等开会的人到齐了，老翟才问大家，评得怎么样？大家都说好，就是不知道怎么搞的。这时，翟永福就把张庆元、张成娃介绍给大家。这两位老汉就把自己的经历说了说，接着漫峪口管理区的支部书记又介绍了组织秋田加工的经验。这么一来，大家才明白了，原来加工可以促进作物生长。会上哗的一下乱了套，这个说开了眼，那个说开了脑筋，都急的要回去给晚秋加工。这时，老翟又把大家挡住了。他说：“大家别急，还有问题哩。古话说，晚秋扛不住白露风，眼看白露到了，加上一阵工，白露风一吹，玉茭干了叶，绿豆发了灰，怎办？”是呀！把大家怔住了。这时，有经验的干部才想起来：庄稼扛不过白露风，是因为苗不壮，苗壮了一样活！“对！”，这个意见大家都赞成。这时，老翟问大家还有什么问题没有？大家说没有。老翟就代表公社党委说：“好，全部秋田普遍锄一次，普追一次肥，玉茭全部培土，这就算公社党委的决定。口号是：立了秋，更加油。”先先后后两个多小时，大家开了脑筋，满怀信心地走了。
    开了会的第二天，全公社就开展了晚秋加工运动。口号各式各样，什么“有草锄草，没草保墒”啦，什么“一锄一肥，赶出大穗”啦。七天时间，四万亩玉茭的地皮翻了个个儿，普遍追了肥，培了土。这一家伙，立竿见影，苗苗光往好处变，穗穗齐水水地冒出了头。9月7日是“白露”，虽然一连刮了四天大风，把柿子吹得落了一层，可玉茭还是绿汪汪，像中年人一样，长得结结实实。
    评价
    今年过去了九个多月，这九个多月，汉薛公社党委就这样开了十一次全公社的干部会议，把牲畜管理、食堂管理、夏收、整地、秋田管理等各项工作，安排的扎扎实实。没有一次会议耽误过一天时间，也没有一次会议流于形式，出色地运用了从群众中来到群众中去的工作方法开会，使管理区、生产队的干部们有足够的时间去踏踏实实地做工作。就因为这个缘故，提起开会来，下边的干部们总是说：“这可是我们公社的新风气哩，过去呀，书记们辛辛苦苦做上半天报告，咱还记不上两句，宝就没取回来，咋能运用？现今可不一样，上级的指示，咱能在会上看得见，摸得着，拿得起，当然，有宝就能取回来。”
