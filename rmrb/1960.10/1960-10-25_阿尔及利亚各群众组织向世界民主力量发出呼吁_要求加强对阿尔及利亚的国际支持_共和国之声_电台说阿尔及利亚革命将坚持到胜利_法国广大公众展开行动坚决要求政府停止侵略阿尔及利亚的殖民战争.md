Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, October 23rd: Algerian national organizations of workers, students, youth and women today jointly issued an appeal to democratic forces around the world, calling for an International Day of Solidarity with the Algerian People to be held on November 1st.

    November 1, 1960, marks the sixth anniversary of the Algerian War.

    The appeal said, "On the eve of the United Nations' discussion of the Algerian question, we appeal to all workers, student, youth and women's organizations, and all democratic forces around the world, to condemn France's imperialist war in Algeria."

    The appeal concluded by emphasizing that the Algerian people's struggle for liberation is related to the people of the entire world and is a just struggle for the cause of freedom and peace.

    In addition, the General Staff of the Algerian National Liberation Army today issued an appeal to Africans in the French army in Algeria, calling on them to refuse to fight against the Algerian people and to leave the French army.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 22nd: The "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station tonight paid tribute to the Algerian patriotic heroes in French prisons on the fourth anniversary of the French imperialist authorities' kidnapping of five Algerian nationalist leaders. The radio station said, "Our people and the revolution will continue until we achieve independence, freedom, and complete sovereignty."

    The French colonial authorities in Algeria shamelessly kidnapped Ben Bella and four other leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front on October 22, 1956, and have kept them in French prisons ever since.

    The radio station said, "When France took international gangster actions, it believed it could stop the upsurge of our revolution and struggle. It ignored that our revolution is not a revolution of a few people, but a revolution of the entire people demanding the firm realization of their country's freedom and independence."

    The radio station said that the Algerian people have proven that their revolution is a people's revolution. French imperialism has not achieved any victory in opposing the Algerian people's struggle. During this period, the Algerian National Liberation Army has become stronger and stronger, and many countries have recognized the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic as the legitimate representative of the Algerian people.

    The radio station went on to say that it is strange that De Gaulle still believes that he can deceive us with his flowery words about peace. All these actions are nothing more than conspiracies carried out under pressure or world opinion.

    The radio station finally pointed out that De Gaulle should remember: "The only way to resolve the Algerian War is to fully recognize our legitimate rights to freedom, independence, and sovereignty."

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 22nd: Demonstrations against the colonial war in Algeria are growing stronger in France.

    The National Union of Students of France and four other groups, including the General Confederation of Labor of France, have called on the French people to participate in the "National Day of Action" against the colonial war in Algeria to be held on October 27th. This call has received widespread response. The National Federation of Railway Workers of France, which participates in the General Confederation of Labor of France, has printed 100,000 leaflets calling on railway workers to support the National Day of Action.

    Union representatives of various political beliefs in Lille issued a statement stating that they have decided to jointly participate in the "Day of Action."

    The Peace Committee of the Seine Province issued a statement demanding that all those who demand an end to the colonial war in Algeria participate in the Day of Action. The statement also strongly protested the French government's blatant ban on demonstrations in Paris on the 27th.

    Demonstrations against this unjust war continue to be held in cities across France. Seven thousand five hundred metalworkers in Saint-Etienne held a one-hour strike on the 21st to express their opposition to the continuation of the colonial war in Algeria. The French Women's Union hosted a meeting in Paris attended by mothers and wives of French soldiers fighting in Algeria.

    In Nancy, hundreds of demonstrators held a demonstration on the streets, regardless of the police's ban and brutal intervention. Thirty representatives of the city's residents simultaneously visited the municipal council and handed over to the municipal council the residents' resolution demanding an end to the colonial war in Algeria.

    The city of Vitry, a suburb of Paris, held a protest meeting at the city hall on the 21st, and the mayor of Vitry also delivered a speech at the meeting.

    Rallies against the Algerian War have been held in the Seine province, various towns in the suburbs of Paris, the Seine-et-Oise province, and the Moselle province.

    阿尔及利亚各群众组织向世界民主力量发出呼吁
    要求加强对阿尔及利亚的国际支持
    “共和国之声”电台说阿尔及利亚革命将坚持到胜利
    法国广大公众展开行动坚决要求政府停止侵略阿尔及利亚的殖民战争
    新华社突尼斯23日电　阿尔及利亚工人、学生、青年和妇女的全国性组织，今天联合向世界各民主力量发出呼吁，要求在11月1日举行声援阿尔及利亚人民的国际行动日。
    1960年11月1日是阿尔及利亚战争的六周年。
    呼吁书说，“在联合国就阿尔及利亚问题进行讨论的前夕，我们向世界一切工人、学生、青年和妇女组织以及一切民主力量发出呼吁，要求它们谴责法国在阿尔及利亚进行帝国主义战争。”
    呼吁书最后强调指出，阿尔及利亚人民解放斗争是和全世界人民有关的，这是为争取自由与和平事业的正义斗争。
    此外，阿尔及利亚民族解放军总参谋部今天向在阿尔及利亚的法国军队中的非洲人发出了呼吁，呼吁他们拒绝跟阿尔及利亚人民作战，离开法国军队。
    新华社开罗22日电　“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台今晚在纪念法帝国主义当局绑架五名阿尔及利亚民族主义领袖四周年的时候，向在法国监狱中的阿尔及利亚爱国英雄们致敬。电台说，“我们的人民和革命将继续下去，直到我们获得独立、自由和完全的主权时为止。”
    阿尔及利亚的法国殖民当局曾于1956年10月22日无耻地绑架了本·贝拉等五位阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的领袖，并一直把他们关在法国监狱里。
    电台说，“当法国采取国际强盗行动时，它认为它能够制止我们的革命和斗争的高涨。它忽略了，我们的革命不是少数人的革命，而是要求坚决实现自己国家的自由和独立的全体人民的革命。”
    电台说，阿尔及利亚人民证明，他们的革命是人民革命。法帝国主义在反对阿尔及利亚人民斗争方面并没有取得任何胜利。在这期间，阿尔及利亚民族解放军却愈来愈强大，许多国家承认阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府是阿尔及利亚人民的合法代表。
    电台接着说，奇怪的是，戴高乐仍然认为，他可以用他关于和平的花言巧语来欺骗我们。他们这一切做法只不过是在压力或世界舆论之下进行的阴谋而已。
    电台最后指出，戴高乐应该记住：“解决阿尔及利亚战争的唯一办法就是完全承认我们的自由、独立和主权的合法权利。”
    据新华社巴黎22日电　法国各地反对阿尔及利亚殖民战争的示威声势日益壮大。
    法国全国学生联合会和法国总工会等四个团体号召法国人民参加在10月27日举行的反对阿尔及利亚殖民战争的“全国行动日”，这个号召得到广泛的响应。参加法国总工会的法国全国铁路员工联合会，已经印刷了十万份传单，号召铁路工人支持全国行动日。
    里尔城的各种政治信仰的工会代表发表声明，表示它们决定共同参加“行动日”。
    塞纳省和平委员会发表声明，要求所有要求停止阿尔及利亚殖民战争的人都参加行动日。声明还强烈抗议法国政府悍然禁止27日在巴黎举行示威的决定。
    在法国全国各城市都继续举行了反对这个不正义战争的示威。圣太田的七千五百名五金工人21日举行了一小时罢工，表示反对继续阿尔及利亚殖民战争。法兰西妇女联盟在巴黎主持了在阿尔及利亚作战的法军士兵的母亲和妻子参加的大会。
    在南锡，成百示威者不顾警察的禁止和粗暴的干涉，在大街上举行了示威。这个城市的居民的三十位代表同时访问了市政委员会，把居民们要求停止阿尔及利亚殖民战争的决议交给市政委员会。
    巴黎郊区的维特里市21日在市政厅举行了抗议大会，维特里市的市长也在会上发表了演说。
    在塞纳省、巴黎郊区各市镇、塞纳—瓦兹省和摩泽尔省，都举行了反对阿尔及利亚战争的集会。
