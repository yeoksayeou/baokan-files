Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 7th: The U.S. government continues to intensify its arms expansion and war preparations.

It is reported that the U.S. government's military spending is currently increasing sharply. "Fortune" magazine recently reported: "Throughout the summer, defense contracts (for the U.S. government's orders of military supplies) have greatly exceeded the levels of one or two years ago, and will maintain a high level in the future." The magazine stated: "The Department of Defense is currently not only using the funds that were unused in 1960 (fiscal year), but also using the appropriations for 1961 (fiscal year) passed by Congress this year and released earlier than in previous years. The President recently decided to expand many procurement plans, such as the plans to purchase 'Polaris' missiles, 'Samos' satellites, and B-70 bombers. All of this guarantees an increase of two billion dollars in defense spending within a year."

"U.S. News & World Report" magazine also stated that in the 1961 fiscal year, the U.S. government's military spending, including atomic energy programs and foreign military "aid," will be $46.6 billion, an increase of $600 million compared to the 1960 fiscal year. The magazine also said that in the 1960 fiscal year, the U.S. military's orders for military supplies were approximately $19 billion, and in the 1961 fiscal year, they will increase to $21 billion. Of the increased $2 billion in military orders, $1.2 billion will be used to purchase weapons such as submarines and missiles, and $800 million will be used to expand research and testing programs, especially those related to missile development.

The U.S. Department of Defense announced on the 1st that, of the $169 million in additional military expenses provided by Congress this year, over $107 million is being used to accelerate the development of "Polaris" submarines, and over $25 million is being used to "modernize" the army.

    加紧扩充军备　准备侵略战争
    美国政府大量增加军事订货
    决定增加二十亿美元采购导弹和轰炸机等
  据新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府继续在加紧扩军备战。
    据报道，美国政府的军事开支目前正在急剧增加中。“幸福”杂志不久前报道说：“在整个夏季（美国政府订购军事物资的）国防合同一直大大超过一、两年前的水平，而且今后还将维持在一个高水平上。”杂志说：“国防部目前不但在使用在1960（财政年度）未动用的基金，而且还动用国会今年通过的、比往年早发放的1961（财政年度）的拨款。总统最近已经决定扩大许多种采购计划，例如购买‘北极星’式导弹、‘萨摩斯’式卫星和B—70式轰炸机的计划等。这一切保证了防御开支一年内增加二十亿美元。”
    “美国新闻与世界报道”杂志也说，在1961财政年度，美国政府包括原子能计划和对外军事“援助”等项目在内的军事开支将为四百六十六亿美元，比1960财政年度增加六亿美元。杂志还说，在1960财政年度，美国三军的军事订货约为一百九十亿美元，到1961财政年度将增加到二百一十亿美元。在增加的二十亿美元的军事订货中，十二亿美元是用来购买潜水艇和导弹等武器的，八亿美元是用来扩大研究和试验计划的，特别是用于同发展导弹有关的计划。
    美国国防部在1日已经宣布，在国会今年提供的一亿六千九百万美元的追加军事费用中，一亿零七百多万美元正用于加速发展“北极星”式潜艇，另外二千五百多万美元用来使陆军“现代化”。
