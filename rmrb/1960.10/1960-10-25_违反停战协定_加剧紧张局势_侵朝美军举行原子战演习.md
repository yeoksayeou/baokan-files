Violating the Armistice Agreement and Intensifying Tensions
US Troops Invading Korea Conduct Atomic Warfare Exercises

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, reported on the 19th, citing a report from the Tonghwa News Agency in South Korea, that earlier this month, the US imperialists once again illegally transported F-86D interceptor fighter jets into South Korea.

    The Korean Central News Agency stated that following the recent "firepower demonstration" by the US First Cavalry Division on the "front line" in South Korea, the US aggressors are preparing to conduct "large-scale autumn atomic war exercises" in the Chuncheon area for eight days starting on the 24th of this month. This is "the largest exercise since the establishment" of the South Korean puppet army.

    The Korean Central News Agency pointed out that these violations of the Korean Armistice Agreement occurred after the recent visit of senior US military officers to South Korea. This proves that the provocative clamor in South Korea was provoked under the deliberate planning of the Pentagon.

    违反停战协定　加剧紧张局势
    侵朝美军举行原子战演习
    据新华社平壤讯　据朝鲜中央通讯社19日援引朝鲜南方的同和通讯社消息说，本月早些时候，美帝国主义者再一次非法地把F—86D阻击战斗机运入朝鲜南方。
    朝鲜中央通讯社说，继美国第一骑兵师最近在朝鲜南方“前线”举行“火力表演”以后，美国侵略者正准备从本月24日起的八天中，在春川地区举行“大规模的秋季原子战争演习”，这是朝鲜南方伪军“建立以来最大的一次演习”。
    朝鲜中央通讯社指出，这种违反朝鲜停战协定的事情是在美国高级军官最近访问朝鲜南方以后发生的。这证明朝鲜南方的挑衅性叫嚣是在五角大楼蓄意策划下挑起来的。
