Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 15th: Agriculture in Tibet has achieved a bumper harvest this year. After the autumn harvest, hundreds of thousands of emancipated peasants comprehensively summarized their experiences in achieving high yields, creating favorable conditions for accelerating the development of agricultural production in Tibet and striving for a bumper harvest next year.

When summarizing their experiences in achieving high yields, Tibetan farmers in various regions believe that: Implementing democratic reform under the leadership of the Party is the prerequisite for achieving a bumper agricultural harvest this year. Due to the basic completion of the democratic reform, millions of serfs were emancipated, and farmers in agricultural areas with a population of 800,000 have been allocated land, greatly liberating the productive forces.

Farmers in various regions used their personal experiences to illustrate the superiority of organizing mutual aid and cooperation when summarizing their experiences in achieving high yields. The common belief among farmers is: To rapidly develop production, it is necessary to take the socialist road. In areas where democratic reform has been completed, more than 100,000 emancipated peasant households have formed more than 10,000 agricultural production mutual aid teams. This huge collective force expanded the sown area by 300,000 "ke" (one "ke" is approximately equal to one "mu"), applied more than 15 billion jin of fertilizer to the fields, built canals in arid areas, and reformed more than 300,000 pieces of agricultural tools, turning many previously barren and poor valleys into prosperous villages. Kading Village in Mozhugongka County, Lhasa, is located in a high and cold area with barren land. Before the democratic reform, the 11 impoverished serf households in the village lacked food and clothing and lived a very hard life. After the democratic reform, the farmers in this mountain village organized themselves and, relying on collective strength, converted all the dry land into irrigated land and implemented intensive cultivation. After this year's autumn harvest, this poor mountain gully quickly became a happy village.

Tibetan farmers deeply understand that: Implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture is the basic measure for greatly increasing agricultural production. In the Shannan Special Region, due to the implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, not only did the mild climate and fertile plains produce significantly more than in previous years, but also the barren and backward high-altitude mountainous areas achieved unprecedented bumper harvests of various crops. Farmers in Nimu County, Lhasa, used fertile soil to transform nearly 10,000 "ke" of gravelly soil on both sides of the Nimu River, diverted water from the mountains, and built water conservancy projects, making this remote river valley with many terraced fields a model county for agricultural production in the Lhasa area. Various regions also manufactured and reformed autumn harvesting tools on a large scale, and universally promoted stone rollers for threshing, which improved work efficiency several times compared to using yaks for threshing in the past, making this year's autumn harvest fast and good.

When summarizing their experiences in achieving high yields, farmers in various regions particularly emphasized that: The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for their achievement of this year's bumper harvest and for future development of production and building a happy life. Since the autumn of last year, Party organizations in various regions have actively led farmers in the struggle for democratic reform. Then, they led and helped emancipated peasants organize themselves, widely launched patriotic production labor emulation campaigns, and carried out preparatory work such as large-scale water, soil, fertilizer, seed, and agricultural tool reforms. After the beginning of spring, the Party called on farmers to break with conventions, eliminate superstition, sow early, cultivate intensively, improve farming methods, strengthen field management, and fight against various natural disasters. Leading cadres at all levels of the Party also went deep into the front line of production, eating, living, working, and discussing with farmers, leading them to continuously push production forward. Many Party members and cadres in districts and townships took the lead in enduring hardships and labor, forming close friendships with farmers, and making the Party's policies more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Tibetan farmers say that the leadership of the Party is more important than nectar and sunshine; without the leadership of the Party, crops cannot grow well.

Currently, farmers in various parts of Tibet have launched activities such as reclaiming wasteland, autumn plowing, seed selection, and fertilizer accumulation, applying this year's bumper harvest experience, starting early, and striving for an even greater harvest next year. (Attached pictures)

### 加强党的领导　实现民主改革　组织互助合作　贯彻八字宪法  西藏地区农业生产获得大丰收  翻身农民总结丰产经验，大搞秋季生产，力争明年更大丰收

    加强党的领导　实现民主改革　组织互助合作　贯彻八字宪法
    西藏地区农业生产获得大丰收
    翻身农民总结丰产经验，大搞秋季生产，力争明年更大丰收
    据新华社拉萨15日电　西藏地区的农业今年获得大丰收，几十万翻身农民在秋收后，全面总结了丰产经验，为加速发展西藏农业生产，争取明年丰收创造良好条件。
    各地藏族农民在总结丰产经验时都认为：在党的领导下，实行民主改革，是今年获得农业大丰收的前提。由于民主改革的基本完成，百万农奴翻了身，有八十万人口的农业区的农民已经分得了土地，使生产力获得大解放。
    各地农民在总结丰产经验中都用亲身经历，说明组织互助合作的优越性。农民们共同的信念是：要想迅速发展生产，必须走社会主义的道路。在完成了民主改革的地区，十万多翻身农户组成了一万多个农业生产互助组，这支巨大的集体力量把今年的播种面积扩大了三十万克（一克约等于一亩），把一百五十多亿斤肥料施入了田里，还在干旱地带修起了水渠，改革了三十多万件农具，使许多过去荒凉贫瘠的山谷逐渐变成了富裕的村庄。拉萨地区墨竹工卡县卡东村地势高寒，土地贫瘠，民主改革前，全村十一户贫苦农奴缺吃缺穿，生活十分贫苦。民主改革后，这个山村的农民组织起来，依靠集体力量，将旱地全部改为水浇地，实行精耕细作。今年秋收后，这个穷山沟迅速变成幸福村。
    西藏农民深深体会到：贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，是农业大增产的基本措施。在山南专区，由于贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，不仅使气候温和、土质肥沃的平川地带较往年大量增产，而且使地质瘠薄、生产落后的高寒山区，各种农作物也获得了空前丰收。拉萨地区尼木县农民把尼木河两岸近万克砂砾土用沃土作了改造，并劈山引水，兴修水利，使这个梯田重重的偏僻河谷一跃而为拉萨地区的农业生产红旗县。各地还大制大改秋收工具，普遍推行石磙打场，比过去用牦牛踩场提高工效好几倍，使今年的秋收进行得又快又好。
    在总结丰产经验的时候，各地农民都特别强调：党的领导是他们取得今年丰收和今后发展生产、建设幸福生活的根本保证。从去年秋季起，各地党组织就积极领导农民进行民主改革的斗争。接着，又领导和帮助翻身农民组织起来，广泛开展爱国丰产劳动竞赛运动，大搞水、土、肥、种和农具改革等备耕工作。开春后，党又号召农民打破常规，破除迷信，提前播种，精耕细作，改进耕作方法，加强田间管理，和各种自然灾害作斗争。党的各级领导干部还纷纷深入生产第一线，和农民同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，领导农民不断把生产推向前进。许多区、乡的党员干部吃苦在前，劳动带头，和农民结成了亲密的朋友，使党的政策更加深入人心。西藏农民说，党的领导比甘露和阳光还重要，没有党的领导，庄稼长不好。
    现在，西藏各地农民已经展开了开荒、秋耕、选种、积肥等活动，运用今年的丰产经验，及早动手，争取明年更大的丰收。（附图片）
