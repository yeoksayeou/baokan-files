    Sydney – Five thousand Australian dockworkers left all ships in the port of Sydney on the morning of the 29th to protest the Menzies government's intention to amend the Federal Criminal Law. According to the plan, all ports in Australia will hold a similar one-day strike. In Australia, a mass movement against the Menzies government's amendment to the Federal Criminal Law has already been launched. Participants in this movement include the Australian Communist Party, various trade unions, workers, intellectuals, students, journalists, and religious figures. The Central Political Bureau Committee of the Australian Communist Party has issued a statement calling on the people and Communist Party members to do everything possible to carry out the struggle against the amendment of the Federal Criminal Law.

    悉尼码头工人罢工抗议政府修改联邦刑法
    五千名澳大利亚码头工人二十九日上午离开了悉尼港口的所有船只，对孟席斯政府打算修改联邦刑法表示抗议。按照计划，澳大利亚全部港口将举行历时一天的同样的罢工。在澳大利亚，目前已经掀起了一个反对孟席斯政府修改联邦刑法的群众运动。参加这个运动的有澳大利亚共产党、各工会以及工人、知识分子、学生、新闻界和宗教界人士等。澳大利亚共产党中央政治局委员会曾发表声明，号召人民和共产党员竭尽一切努力来进行反对修改联邦刑法的斗争。
