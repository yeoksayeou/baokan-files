Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The China Political Science and Law Association today issued a protest against the Iranian authorities' atrocities in persecuting four patriots.

The protest stated that recently, the Iranian military court, disregarding the strong opposition of the Iranian people, again sentenced four patriots, Barouyan, Kaseiro, Yousef, and Chariatte, to death. This cruel persecution of the patriotic Iranian people by the Iranian authorities is a blatant violation of justice and the most basic humanitarian principles. The China Political Science and Law Association, representing all Chinese legal workers, expresses strong indignation and lodges a solemn protest.

The protest pointed out that the Iranian government's adoption of a fascist terror policy at home, continuously trampling on human rights and the people's democratic rights, is inseparable from its actively siding with U.S. imperialism, betraying national interests, and turning Iran into a military base and colony of U.S. imperialism. However, we solemnly warn the Iranian authorities that the Iranian people's strong will to demand independence and democracy is invincible, and any suppression by the reactionary ruling clique is doomed to failure.

The protest concludes by stating that all Chinese legal workers, together with international individuals who uphold justice, firmly support the Iranian people's patriotic and just struggle and demand the immediate revocation of this heinous verdict and the restoration of freedom to all Iranian patriots.

    中国政法学会抗议伊朗当局迫害爱国者
    新华社11日讯　中国政治法律学会今天发表抗议书，抗议伊朗当局迫害四位爱国者的暴行。
    抗议书说，最近伊朗军事法庭悍然不顾伊朗人民的强烈反对，又判处四位爱国者巴鲁扬、卡赛罗、优素福和查里雅特的死刑。伊朗当局对伊朗爱国人民所施行的这种残酷迫害，是对于正义和最起码的人道原则的粗暴的破坏。中国政治法律学会代表全中国法律工作者表示强烈的愤慨，并且提出严正的抗议。
    抗议书指出，伊朗政府对内采取法西斯恐怖政策，不断蹂躏人权和人民民主权利，这是同它积极投靠美帝国主义、出卖民族利益，使伊朗变为美帝国主义的军事基地和殖民地的卖国政策分不开的。但是，我们正告伊朗当局，伊朗人民要求独立和民主的坚强意志是不可战胜的，反动统治集团的任何镇压是注定要失败的。
    抗议书最后表示，中国全体法律工作者同主持正义的国际人士一道，坚决支持伊朗人民的爱国正义斗争，要求立即撤销这种罪恶的判决，恢复伊朗所有爱国者的自由。
