Deeply Into the Front Lines to Grasp Key Production Issues
Yipinglang Coal Mine Sees Significant Increase in Daily Output on One Working Face

(Our newspaper, Kunming, October 29th) The 2501 working face of the No. 2 Mine at the Yipinglang Coal Mine in Yunnan Province has seen a significant increase in production by using the "measurement and writing" working method to find key problems in production, based on the meticulous ideological work of cadres sent to the front lines. The average daily output in June was 521 tons; in August, it rose to 614 tons; and in late September, the average daily output was 808 tons, with a peak of 1,061 tons.

After the mine's leading cadres went deep into the front lines of production, they further mobilized the masses to solve key production problems. What constituted the key to production was a matter of differing opinions at the time. Some said the electric chute was not good; others said the electric locomotive derailed, there were not enough mine cars for circulation, and the main haulage was not keeping up; still others said coal mining could not keep up with transportation. Where exactly was the key? In order to solve this problem, the leaders of the No. 2 Mine and the 2501 working face specially organized a team of six people, led by the deputy mine director, to go down into the pit to conduct measurements and record facts for each process, from coal mining and electric chutes to electric locomotives. After several days of measurement and writing, it was proved that the main problems at that time were, first, that transportation could not meet the needs, and the main problems with transportation were that the electric locomotive could not operate normally and the scheduling and circulation of mine cars was not good; second, that roof management on the coal mining face was not good, there were many electric chute accidents, and coal mining and transportation could not be well connected. After finding these key problems, they further analyzed them, believing that the more prominent contradiction at that time was that transportation could not keep up with coal mining, so they mobilized the masses to come up with ideas and methods to first solve the problem of electric locomotives operating normally. The use of electric locomotives in the 2501 working face was a struggle between advanced and backward thinking. In the past, some cadres had believed that electric locomotives were not as good as handcarts because electric locomotives often derailed and were not efficient. After repeated discussions, the masses looked for reasons from various aspects and unanimously believed that the reason why electric locomotives could not operate normally was that the original design of the main haulage was based on manual carts, so the curves in some places were too small, the slopes were too steep, and the height and width were not enough, and the rails were not firmly installed. Therefore, it was easy to cause derailment and other accidents. After analyzing this series of problems, the leaders believed that the only way to solve these problems under the existing conditions was to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements. When the masses were mobilized and recognized the main direction of attack, they immediately cleaned up the main haulage, widened the curves, adjusted the slopes, reinforced the tracks, and added brakes and signal lights to the electric locomotives, and tried every means to make their own batteries and fuses, so that the problems were solved one by one.

After the transportation problem was initially solved, the contradiction became prominent again in coal mining. At that time, there were about two hours or more in each shift when coal could not be produced. To make coal mining keep up with transportation, it was necessary to solve the problems of roof management, electric chute accidents, and coal storage bins on the coal mining face. After discussion by the masses, it was decided to promote the advanced experience of double-row dense pillars in roof management to replace the existing single-row pillars, which would be convenient for operation and ensure safety. They summed up the operating experience of some advanced groups to greatly reduce electric chute accidents. In terms of coal storage equipment, they designed and built coal bins themselves through the workers, which could store more than 30 tons of coal. If there were no cars for a certain period of time, coal could still be produced on the working face, and if there was no coal production on the working face, there would still be coal for the cars to pull. This solved the connection between coal mining and transportation and greatly promoted production.

    深入现场掌握生产关键
    一平浪煤矿一个工作面日产量大幅度上升
    本报昆明29日电　云南省一平浪煤矿二矿2501工作面，在干部深入小组细致做思想工作的基础上，用“测定写实”的工作方法，寻找生产中的关键问题，推动生产大幅度增长。6月份平均日产量是五百二十一吨；8月份上升至六百一十四吨；9月下旬平均日产量为八百零八吨，最高达一千零六十一吨。
    这个矿的领导干部深入到生产第一线后，进一步发动群众解决生产上的关键问题。什么是生产关键，当时各说不一。有的说是电溜子不好；有的说是电机车跳道、车皮不够周转、大巷运输跟不上；有的说是采煤跟不上运输。到底关键在哪里？为了解决这个问题，二矿和2501工作面的领导上专门组织了六个人，由副矿长带队。到坑内从采煤、电溜子到电机车等各项工序进行测定写实。经过几天的测定写实，证明当时主要的问题，第一是运输不能适应需要，而运输的主要问题是电机车不能正常运转和车皮调度周转不好；第二是采煤工作面上顶板管理不好，电溜子事故多，采煤与运输不能很好地衔接。找到了这些关键问题以后，他们又进一步进行分析，认为当时比较突出的矛盾是运输跟不上采煤，因此他们就发动群众出主意、想办法，首先解决电机车正常运转问题。在2501工作面使用电机车是一场先进与落后思想的斗争，过去有些干部曾经认为电机车不如手推车，因为电机车经常跳道，效率不高。经过反复讨论，群众从多方面找原因，一致认为电机车不能正常运转是由于大巷原设计是以人工推车，所以部分地方的弯道过小，坡道过大，高度和宽度不够，铁轨的安设不够稳固。因此，容易造成跳道等事故。领导上分析了这一系列问题，认为在现有条件下解决这些问题，唯一办法就是开展技术革新和技术革命运动。当群众被发动起来，并且认识了主攻方向以后，立即清理了大巷，加宽了弯道，调整了坡道，加固了轨道，并在电机车上加上刹车板、信号灯，千方百计自制电瓶和保险丝，这样就使问题一一迎刃而解。
    运输问题初步得到解决后，矛盾又在采煤方面突出了。当时每班约有两小时以上不能出煤。要使采煤跟上运输，必须解决采煤工作面上的顶板管理、电溜子事故及储煤仓等问题。经群众讨论，决定在顶板管理上推广双排密集支柱的先进经验，用以代替现有的单排支柱，这样既方便操作，又能保证安全。他们总结了一些先进小组的操作经验，使电溜子的事故大为减少。在储煤设备方面，他们通过工人自己设计，修建了煤仓，能储煤三十多吨，一定时间内没有车子，工作面上也可以出煤，工作面上不出煤，车子也有煤可拉。这样就解决了采煤与运输的衔接问题，大大促进了生产。
