Party Committee Secretary's Notes

"Sweet Songs" on the Fuchun River
Zhang Yuntian, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Tonglu County Committee, Zhejiang

	Mountains within mountains, bays within bays,
	The Party's sun shines on the mountain bays,
	Granaries full, pigsties full,
	Stone mountains transformed into mountains of gold and silver.
	Flowers bloom in every season,
	The commune's flowers bloom for ten thousand years,
	Fragrant meals three times a day,
	Every household filled with joy.

The above two folk songs circulate along the banks of the Fuchun River. Farmers sing them with their mouths and feel them sweetly in their hearts, so they call such folk songs "sweet songs." The creation of these two "sweet songs" is the result of the great practice of the Fuchun River farmers, under the leadership of the Party, engaging in conquering nature. In recent years, the people on both sides of the Fuchun River have set high ambitions and great goals, marched towards the poor mountains and evil waters, and fought against the heavens to change the face of thin land and poor people. Last year, due to the bumper harvest of grain, not only did they provide the state with a large amount of commercial grain to support socialist construction, but also, after completing the state's requisition task and retaining enough rations, seeds, and feed, they retained a large amount of reserve grain. This year's spring flowers and early rice harvests are even better than last year, and the planting area of ​​late rice and other crops has also been expanded compared to last year; whether on the terraced fields in the mountains or the sandy fields along the riverbanks, there is a good harvest of rice everywhere, foreshadowing a great scene of late rice surpassing early rice. The rapid development of grain production, as well as the development of industry, animal husbandry, forestry, and other undertakings, has greatly improved people's lives. Therefore, men, women, old and young, sincerely use "sweet songs" to praise the Party and their happy lives.

People still remember vividly that before liberation, the lives of the farmers on the Fuchun River were very miserable. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionary government and feudal landlords cruelly oppressed the farmers, and natural and man-made disasters occurred year after year. The land was barren and infertile. About two-thirds of the county's arable land had crop failures in nine out of ten years. The level of agricultural production was very low. In a so-called "bumper year," one mu of land could only yield two hundred catties of grain. At that time, there were also two folk songs popular among the farmers of the Fuchun River:

	High mountains, low mountains,
	Stone mountains everywhere,
	Three meals a day rely on other people's fields,
	Wild vegetables and mao bamboo shoots as regular meals.
	Three drops of rain make a bubble,
	Farmers on the riverbank climb onto the stove,
	One day of sunshine,
	Half of the crops are scorched,
	Tears in their eyes,
	Bellies grumbling.

In order to change the disaster-ridden, thin-land-poor-people's face of their hometown and transform the grain-deficient area into a surplus-grain area, after liberation, especially since 1958, under the leadership of the Party, people have held high the three red banners, worked hard to become strong, struggled arduously, relied on the collective strength of the organized people, fully exerted their subjective initiative, mastered the laws of nature, set high ambitions, established great aspirations, and demanded grain from the limited land and time.

This is a mountainous area, and the banks along the Fuchun River are also a flood-prone and drought-prone area. Over the past two years, the people have relied on the superiority of the "large in size and collective in nature" commune to carry out a struggle to seize grain from the heavens. In the mountainous areas, they launched a mass movement of "moving stones to transform into gold mountains, filling mountains with ten thousand catties of sweet potatoes." In the harsh winter months, the broad masses of commune members braved the cold wind, rain, and snow, climbed the mountains to deeply plow the land, and marched towards the barren mountains day and night. The Shangguan Commune had a youth commando team known as the "Rocket Team," which, in the freezing cold days, dug out large stones weighing one or two thousand catties from the ground and pushed them into the mountain pits. After turning over the stones, they carried fertilizer up the mountain, spreading more than a hundred loads of green grass and soil ash per mu. When there was a drought, in order to protect the seedlings, the commune members proposed "if the sky doesn't rain, people will rain," and they carried water up the mountain. When the water in the mountain pits was exhausted, they dug spring water. Last year, sweet potatoes achieved a great bumper harvest.

The high mountain paddy fields in the mountainous area are high and cold, and in the past, only single-season rice was planted, with very low yields. In order to turn single-season rice into double-season rice, and low-yield fields into high-yield fields, the commune members proposed the slogan "transform high mountains into granaries" and marched towards the high mountain paddy fields. The commune members were of one mind and one heart, mowing a large amount of green grass, burning a large amount of scorched mud ash, and developing a large amount of pig manure. Every mu of paddy field was applied with hundreds of loads of green grass and animal manure as base fertilizer. Not only did the high mountain paddy fields realize the wish of planting double-season rice, but also won a bumper harvest, turning poor mountain gullies into rich mountain valleys.

After conquering the poor mountains, they marched towards the evil waters. We have successively built one hundred and eighty-seven small and medium-sized reservoirs in the mountain bays, freeing tens of thousands of mu of farmland from drought and flood disasters. The Chunjiang Brigade of the Taiping Commune, with only more than 3,000 peasant households, built a flood control dam more than 380 li long, with an average bottom width of 14 meters and a dam height of 4 meters, along both sides of the Fuchun River, surrounding the sandbars on both sides, basically eliminating the flood attacks on the 180,000 mu of flood-prone land. The "August 1st" production team of the Taiping Commune was originally a place prone to flooding and drought, with thin land and poor people. Starting in 1957, the Party branch led the commune members to carry out a struggle to seize grain from the heavens, overcoming the fatalistic idea that "floods cannot be prevented." The entire team mobilized, men and women both took to the battlefield, and continuously carried flood control dikes despite the rain and snow. At that time, the commune members had great difficulty eating grain, so the Party branch secretary, Wang Wenhai, took the lead in eating thin gruel and lent the grain saved to the commune members who had difficulty eating grain. Cadres and commune members united as one, and after a winter and spring of labor, a flood control dike three li long and more than ten feet high stood tall on the banks of the Fuchun River. In this way, many production teams along the river also built flood control dikes, converging into a large embankment with a radius of thirty li, blocking the floods, turning low-yield fields into high-yield fields, and transforming grain-deficient teams into surplus-grain teams.

"To make the river water listen to human command, and transform the sand beach into fertile fields!" After solving the flood problem, the commune members immediately put forward this heroic slogan. To realize this grand aspiration, the only way out is to change "wooden dragons" to "iron dragons" (water pumps) and realize mechanical irrigation. However, due to the thin family background, there were many difficulties. There were two paths in front of them, one was to wait for foreign aid and come slowly; the other was to rely on self-reliance and get started quickly. The commune members chose the latter method, proposing "if money is needed, the commune members will gather it together, if we don't understand the technology, we will learn it ourselves." Over the past few years, the commune members have worked hard to become strong, relying on self-reliance, purchasing more than two hundred water pumps, and learning the technology of using water pumps, making the river water listen to human command and fly to the sand beach. Therefore, the broad masses of commune members carried out large-scale sand removal and soil turning work, turning more than 40,000 mu of sandy land into fertile fields and planting double-cropping rice.

The Party is always concerned about the production and life of the commune members. Leading cadres at all levels of the Party eat, live, work, and discuss with the commune members. At the same time, the Party also sent the best workers and the best machines. All of this converged into a huge production army fighting against the heavens, changing the agricultural face of the banks of the Fuchun River. This also shows that under the leadership of the Party, under the brilliant light of the general line, as long as we establish lofty ambitions, work hard to become strong, and are not intimidated by difficulties, but instead face the difficulties and fight against the heavens and the earth, we will be able to create one miracle after another, be able to bid farewell to the backward face of being poor and blank, quickly realize the modernization of agriculture, and truly become the masters of this land. By that time, there will surely be more and more beautiful "sweet songs" singing day and night with the endless Fuchun River.

### 富春江上的“甜歌”

    富春江上的“甜歌”
    中共浙江桐庐县委员会书记处书记　张运钿
    山里山，湾里湾，
    党的太阳照山湾，
    谷满仓，猪满栏，
    石山变成金银山。
    四季花开季季香，
    公社花开万年长，
    一日三餐饭菜香，
    家家户户喜洋洋。
    上面这两首歌谣，流传在富春江两岸。农民们唱在嘴里，甜在心里，所以，他们把这样的歌谣叫做“甜歌”。这两首“甜歌”的产生，是富春江农民在党的领导下，从事征服大自然的伟大实践所创造的。这几年来，富春江两岸人民树雄心，立大志，向穷山恶水进军，与天斗争，改变了地薄人穷的面貌。去年，由于粮食丰收，不但提供给国家大量商品粮食，支援了社会主义建设，而且在完成国家征购任务、留足口粮、种子、饲料的同时，还留起了大量的储备粮。今年的春花和早稻，收成比去年更好，晚稻等作物的播种面积也比去年扩大；无论是山区梯田上、沿江两岸沙滩田上，都是一片好水稻，到处预示着晚稻超早稻的大好景象。粮食生产的飞速发展，以及工业、畜牧业、林业等各项事业的发展，使人民的生活有了很大的提高。因此，男女老少都衷心地用“甜歌”来歌颂党，来赞美自己的幸福生活。
    人们记忆犹新，解放前，富春江的农民生活是非常悲惨的。那时候，国民党反动政府和封建地主对农民进行残酷的压榨，天灾人祸连年不断，土地荒芜、贫瘠，全县可耕的土地中，约有三分之二左右十年九不收。农业生产水平很低，所谓“丰收年景”，一亩田也只能收到二百斤粮食。那时候，也有两首歌谣，流行在富春江农民中间：
    高高山，低低山，
    前前后后石头山，
    一日三餐靠外畈，
    野菜毛笋当正餐。
    三滴雨水一个泡，
    江岸农民爬上灶，
    太阳一日照，
    庄稼半枯焦，
    眼里泪汪汪，
    肚里咕咕叫。
    为了改变家乡的多灾多难、地薄人穷的面貌，变缺粮区为余粮区，解放后，特别是1958年以来，在党的领导下，人们高高举起三面红旗，发愤图强，艰苦奋斗，依靠组织起来的集体力量，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，掌握大自然的规律，树雄心，立大志，向有限的土地要粮，向时间要粮。
    这里是一个多山的地区，沿富春江两岸又是一个易涝易旱的地区。两年来，人民依靠公社“一大二公”的优越性，开展了与天争粮的斗争。在山区开展了“搬掉石头变金山，万斤番薯长满山”的群众运动。在朔风怒号的严冬腊月里，广大社员冒着寒风雨雪，上山深翻土地，夜以继日地向荒山进军。上官公社有一个号称“火箭队”的青年突击队，在天寒地冻的日子里，把一、二千斤重的大石头，从地下挖出来，又推到山坑里。翻掉石头，又挑肥上山，每亩铺上了百多担的青草和土灰。天旱了，为了保苗，社员们提出了“天不下雨人下雨”，他们挑水上山，山坑里的水挑光了，就挖泉水。去年，番薯获得了大丰收。
    山区的高山田，山高水冷，过去只种单季稻，产量很低。社员们为使单季稻变双季稻，变低产田为高产田，提出了“变高山为谷仓”的口号，向高山田进军。社员们一条心，一股劲，大刈青草，大烧焦泥灰，大搞猪肥，每亩山田都施上了百把担青草和畜肥作底肥。高山田里不但实现了种双季稻的愿望，而且夺得了丰收，使穷山沟变成了富山谷。
    征服穷山，又向恶水进军。我们先后在山湾里筑起了一百八十七个中小型水库，使数万亩田地免受旱涝灾害。只有三千多农户的太平公社春江大队，在富春江两岸筑起了三百八十多华里长、平均底宽十四米、坝高四米的防洪大堤，围抱着两岸沙洲，使易涝的十八万亩土地，基本上免除了洪水侵袭。太平公社的“八一”生产队，原是个易涝易旱、地薄人穷的地方。1957年开始，党支部领导社员开展与天争粮的斗争，克服了“洪水不可防”的听天由命思想。全队总动员，男女都上阵，雨雪不停地大挑防洪堤。当时社员们吃粮十分困难，支部书记汪文海就带头吃稀喝薄，把节约下来的粮借给吃粮困难的社员。干部、社员团结一致，经过一个冬春劳动，一条三华里长、一丈多高的防洪堤，就屹立在富春江畔。就这样，沿江的许多生产队也都修起了防洪堤，汇合成三十里方圆的大围堤，挡住了洪水，使低产田变为高产田，使缺粮队一跃为余粮队。
    “要叫江水听人使唤，变沙滩为良田！”解决了洪患问题，社员们又紧跟着提出了这个英雄的口号。要实现这个宏大的志愿，出路只有变“木龙”为“铁龙”（抽水机），实现机械灌溉。可是由于家底薄，困难很多。摆在面前有两条路，一是等待外援，慢慢地来；二是自力更生，迅速上马。社员们选择了后一种办法，提出了“要钱社员大家凑，技术不懂自己学。”几年来，社员们发愤图强，自力更生，购买了两百多台抽水机，并学会了使用抽水机的技术，使江水听人使唤，飞上沙滩。因此，广大社员进行了大规模的搬沙翻土工作，使四万多亩沙地变为良田，种上连作稻。
    党时刻关心着社员的生产和生活。各级党的领导干部，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。与此同时，党还派来了最出色的工人，送来了最好的机器。这一切汇合成一支巨大的与天斗争的生产大军，改变着富春江两岸的农业面貌。这也说明了，在党的领导之下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，只要树立雄心壮志，发愤图强，不被困难所吓倒，而是去迎战困难，与天斗争，与地斗争，一定能够创造出一个又一个的奇迹，一定能够和一穷二白的落后面貌告别，迅速实现农业的现代化，真正地成为这块土地上的主人。到那时候，一定有更多更美的“甜歌”，随着悠悠不尽的富春江水日夜歌唱。
