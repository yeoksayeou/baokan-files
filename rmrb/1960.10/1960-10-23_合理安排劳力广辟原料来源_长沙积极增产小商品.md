Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, October 22nd: Changsha City, Hunan Province, is making every effort to overcome the difficulties of insufficient labor and raw materials, and is actively increasing the production of daily-use small commodities. Since July, the city has produced more than 6,100 kinds of small commodities, and the quality has also been greatly improved.

In organizing the production of daily-use small commodities, the city first paid attention to rationally arranging labor and saving labor. Necessary labor was arranged for units responsible for supporting grain and steel tasks. All units also mobilized the masses to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, achieving reduced manpower and increased production. Workers in the bamboo ware industry in the handicraft system concentrated their efforts and achieved mechanization of the bamboo splitting and weaving processes within a few days, increasing efficiency by one to three times, so that products such as bamboo baskets, dustpans, and bamboo cart cages that supported grain and steel all overfulfilled their plans. The bicycle factory had heavy tasks and insufficient man-hours, so it fully utilized the superiority of the people's communes, organized elderly and semi-able-bodied women on nearby streets to set up "satellite" factories, and taught operating techniques by having masters train apprentices, which solved the problem of insufficient man-hours for assembling wheels. Thanks to the rational arrangement of labor and the tapping of labor potential, although more than 5,000 strong laborers were transferred from the city's light industry and handicraft systems to reinforce the steel and coal front starting in August, the output in September still increased significantly. At the same time, more than 150 kinds of market "shortage goods" were newly added. Employees of the clock and instrument factory broke superstitions, worked hard, and trial-produced the seventeen-jewel Dashanshan brand watch and the 120-type twin-lens camera.

They adopted methods such as local sourcing and comprehensive utilization to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials by every possible means and to increase income and reduce expenditure. On the one hand, large and small factories were organized to cooperate with each other to fully utilize the offcuts, scraps, and old waste materials of large factories. In more than two months, more than 400 tons of offcuts were collected from various factories and enterprises to supply the production of kerosene lamp holders, hoes, fire tongs, etc. Jianxiang Enamel Factory, Changsha Chemical Machinery Factory, Changsha Leather Factory and other large factories made full use of their own offcuts to add workshops, satellite factories and groups to produce more than 40 kinds of small hardware products such as door buckles, shoe polish boxes, and spoons, totaling hundreds of thousands of pieces. On the other hand, social waste products and waste materials were widely collected and utilized. Since July, more than 3,000 waste product collection stations (points) have been set up in stores, public canteens, people's commune management areas and institutions throughout the city, and more than 100 tons of metal materials such as scrap steel and scrap copper, and more than 300,000 kilograms of old paper, palm hemp, old cotton, waste rubber, and miscellaneous bones have been collected, which effectively solved the problem of insufficient materials for the production of small commodities. The hardware and machinery factory of Miaogaofeng Commune used oil drums to make more than 20 kinds of small hardware products such as small iron pots, soup ladles, leaking ladles, and oil pots. At the same time, many factories improved product design and saved raw materials around the issue of material conservation. The city's Bakelite Electrical Appliance Factory reformed the design of seven of its eight major products, and the consumption of copper alone was reduced from 24 tons per year to 10 tons; the clothing industry comprehensively promoted 60 advanced tailoring methods, which are expected to save 900,000 feet of cloth in half a year, which can make 75,000 Zhongshan suits.

In order to improve product quality, expand variety, and reduce production costs, the city implemented fixed-point professional production for all 200 kinds of major small commodities.

    合理安排劳力广辟原料来源
    长沙积极增产小商品
    据新华社长沙22日电　湖南省长沙市千方百计战胜劳力、原料材料不足的困难，积极增产日用小商品，7月份以来，全市生产的小商品达六千一百多种，质量也有了很大的提高。
    这个市在组织日用小商品生产中，首先注意了合理安排劳力和节约劳力。对担负支援粮、钢任务的单位，都安排了必要的劳动力。各单位并发动群众大闹技术革新和技术革命，实现了减人增产。手工业系统竹器行业的职工，集中力量，在几天内就实现了破篾、编织工序的机械化操作，提高工效一至三倍，使支援粮、钢的箩筐、箢箕、竹车笼等产品都超额完成了计划。自行车厂任务重，工时不足，就充分发挥人民公社的优越性，把附近街道上的老年、妇女半劳力组织起来，办“卫星”厂，并以师傅带徒弟的办法，传授操作技术，解决了装配车轮工时不足的困难。由于合理安排劳力、挖掘劳动潜力，全市轻工业、手工业系统从8月份起尽管调出五千多精壮劳力充实了钢铁煤战线，但9月份的产量仍然有了很大的增长。同时还新增加市场“缺门货”一百五十多种。钟表仪器厂职工破除迷信，发愤图强，试制成了十七钻大三针麓山牌手表和120型双镜头照相机。
    他们采取就地取材、综合利用等办法，千方百计，开源节流，克服原料材料不足的困难。一方面组织大小工厂对口协作，充分利用大工厂的边角料、下脚和旧废料，二个多月就从各个工厂企业搜集了四百多吨边角料，供应了生产煤油灯头、锄头、火钳等需要。建湘搪瓷厂、长沙化工机械厂、长沙制革厂等较大工厂，充分利用本厂的下脚边角料，增设了生产小商品的车间、卫星厂和小组，生产了门扣、皮鞋油盒、调羹等四十多种共几十万件小五金产品。另一方面广泛收集利用社会废品、废料，从7月份起，全市在商店、公共食堂、人民公社管理区和机关设立了三千多个废品收购站（点），已收购废钢铁废铜等金属材料一百多吨，旧纸、棕麻、旧棉、废橡胶、杂骨等三十万多公斤，有力地解决了生产小商品的材料不足的问题。妙高峰公社五金机械厂用油桶制成小铁锅、汤瓢、漏瓢、油壶等二十多种小五金产品。同时，许多工厂围绕节约材料改进产品设计，节约原料材料。市胶木电器厂八种主要产品改革七种产品设计，仅铜的消耗量就由全年需要二十四吨减少为十吨；服装行业全面推行了六十项先进剪裁法，预计半年可节约九十万尺布，可做七万五千套中山服。
    为了提高产品质量，扩大花色品种，降低生产成本，全市对二百多种主要小商品全部实行定点专业生产。
