    Practicing the "Four Together's" Creates Infinite Power
    ——Introducing the Experience of Luojiachuan Production Team Cadres in Implementing the "Four Together's"
    By Our Correspondents Yuan Guangqiang, Yu Bowen, Wu Guoxuan

    Rural cadres in Gansu Province all know that there is a model cadre in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture named Luo Youyuan. Luo Youyuan is the Party Branch Secretary of the Luojiachuan Production Team of the Liujiaxia Commune in Linxia City. For ten years, he has consistently adhered to eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses, leading them to change the backward conditions of the area, with production increasing year after year. In July of this year, the CPC Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture Committee issued a notice to all parts of the prefecture, calling on all cadres to learn from Luo Youyuan's work style. Following this, the *Gansu Daily* reported Luo Youyuan's deeds in detail and published an editorial titled with Luo Youyuan’s frequently used phrase: “A thousand difficulties, ten thousand difficulties, implementing the ‘Four Together’s’ makes it not difficult.” Now, a mass movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass Luo Youyuan is widely and deeply unfolding throughout the entire Linxia Autonomous Prefecture, and rural cadres in other parts of Gansu are also taking Luo Youyuan as an example, striving to improve their leadership methods and leadership style.

    Recently, we visited Luo Youyuan and the Luojiachuan Production Team he leads in Liujiaxia Commune. During our visit, we found that Luo Youyuan not only adheres to the "Four Together's" himself, but also takes the Party Branch as the core, adopting various methods to educate other cadres to also universally achieve the "Four Together's." According to their recent evaluation, among the forty-four cadres at or above the level of Deputy Team Leader, those who do the "Four Together's" relatively well account for 80%, while another 16% of the cadres have basically achieved the "Four Together's." Because cadres have universally achieved the "Four Together's," the masses sincerely love and support the cadres, and everyone is of one mind and one heart, ensuring that all production tasks are completed quickly and well.

    Cadres eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses is the Party's excellent work style and an effective method for implementing the mass line. The cadres of the Luojiachuan Production Team deeply experienced the benefits of implementing the "Four Together's" and have gained a relatively complete set of experiences in this regard.

    **Defining the Standards of the "Four Together's"**
    **Comprehensively Implementing the "Four Together's"**

    The primary step the Luojiachuan Production Team Party Branch took in leading cadres to launch the "Four Together's" movement was to educate everyone to learn from the advanced and clarify the goals of the "Four Together's."

    At the beginning of August this year, this production team, like other areas of the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, launched a movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass Luo Youyuan among all cadres. At the start of the movement, the Party Branch organized cadres to conscientiously study the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee on further improving leadership methods and leadership style. Based on the spirit of the instructions, they examined the problems existing in the work of cadres. During the examination, it was found that some cadres superficially achieved the "Four Together's" but did not actually do so. In light of the specific situation, the Branch led everyone to take Luo Youyuan as a living example to discuss and formulate specific standards for implementing the "Four Together's." These standards are:

    1.  Eating Together - Cadres and commune members must eat in the same canteen, genuinely achieving the same stove, the same table, eating the same food and the same dishes. By eating together, discover problems in the canteen, personally handle the canteen well, and arrange the lives of the commune members. At the same time, the canteen should also be used as a place to discuss issues and consult with commune members to solve problems in production and life.

    2.  Living Together - Cadres of the production team and production team must not be detached from production, and primarily should regularly visit the sick and ask about their difficulties, and care about the combination of work and rest of the masses. When farm work is urgent and it is necessary to camp in the fields, cadres should live with the commune members. Through these activities, understand the opinions and requirements of the commune members, promote the Party's policies and guidelines, and conduct political and ideological education for the commune members.

    3.  Working Together - When cadres participate in labor, they should go to difficult places, to places where the work is heavy, and to places where there are many problems; cadres participating in labor should be conscientious and record work points in the same way as commune members. Through working together, discover and solve problems in a timely manner, discover and promote new experiences, and ensure that key tasks are completed on time with quality and quantity.

    4.  Consulting Together - When eating, living, and working together, all cadres must consult with commune members at all times and on all matters. When cadres consult with commune members on issues, they should put down their airs and fully promote democracy. Correct opinions should be accepted with an open mind, and incorrect opinions should not be immediately rejected, but can be kept for reference and explained clearly.

    After having the above specific standards, a problem was encountered, that is, some cadres asked: which of the four aspects of eating, living, working, and consulting together is more important, and how to correctly grasp the relationship between them? Some people think that working together is important, and some people think that consulting together is important. After everyone discussed based on their own practice, they clearly realized that only by first achieving eating, living, and working together can cadres and commune members be of one mind, and then can consulting together be achieved; after consulting together is achieved, the enthusiasm of the commune members is fully mobilized, and cadres are not needed to frequently inspect and supervise in labor, which in turn can enable cadres to free up more time to participate in labor and promote cadres to adhere to eating, living, and working together with commune members. The "Four Together's" are an effective method for implementing the mass line, and are interrelated, cannot be separated, and should not be biased.

    They have many facts to prove this.

    The Second Production Team Leader, Luo Shidian, had shortcomings in the "Four Together's" in the past. Sometimes when he consulted with the masses, the masses did not tell him the truth. Later, with the help of the Party Branch, he corrected his shortcomings and first truly achieved eating, living, and working together with the commune members. When the masses saw that he had indeed changed, when he consulted with the masses again, the masses actively helped him with ideas. When thinning millet seedlings, some commune members suggested implementing the small contract work system. After he adopted it, the masses worked very hard and thinned more than forty mu in three days, increasing work efficiency by a factor of two.

    Luo Youyuan, the Party Branch Secretary of the Production Team, is a model for comprehensively implementing the "Four Together's." He has consistently led production by participating in production. Last year, he worked more than 130 labor days, and in the first eight months of this year, he worked another 75 labor days. He cares about the lives of the masses everywhere and consults with the masses on everything. The masses regard him as a confidant and are willing to tell him everything in their hearts and actively help him do his work. In February of this year, he was sick and lived in the commune hospital. Several commune members wrote to him to reflect on the problems in production and life in the team. Around him, there are many commune members who act as his "advisors" to help him consider problems. Therefore, all the work of the whole team is active. After the autumn harvest last year, the old farmer Luo Shichang and others proposed to Luo Youyuan that while the people are strong and the animals are strong, all the land for sowing autumn grain this year should be plowed and irrigated before the end of last year, to free up time for spring sowing this year. After Luo Youyuan accepted this suggestion, he organized labor to rush to plow the land and draw ice to irrigate, which made this year's spring sowing work very active. In February of this year, the old farmer Luo Shijie suggested to Luo Youyuan to seize the time and plant radishes first on the land prepared for planting corn to strive to harvest an extra crop of radishes. Luo Youyuan accepted this suggestion and mobilized the masses to plant 367 mu, resulting in a harvest of 150,000 jin, and without delaying the planting of corn.

    The Fifth Production Team's Luo Falian did a good job in the first "Three Together's" in the past, but was not good at consulting with the masses. Because he was not good at consulting with the masses, the masses did not have confidence in carrying out tasks, and their enthusiasm could not be fully exerted. In this way, Luo Falian had to spend some time inspecting and supervising, which took up some of his time participating in labor. Later, with the help of the Party Branch, he learned to consult with the masses and achieved everyone shouldering a thousand-jin burden, and the situation changed. He freed up more time to participate in labor. In the past, he averaged 23-24 labor days per month, and now he can do 28 labor days per month.

    The experience of the Luojiachuan Production Team cadres in implementing the "Four Together's" proves that in order to enable cadres to comprehensively achieve the "Four Together's," different requirements should be put forward based on the different situations of the cadres within a certain period of time. Generally speaking, because the cadres of the production team manage a wide range of issues and have many and complex tasks, it is relatively easy to relax eating with commune members and working with commune members, so they should be required to conscientiously achieve eating and working together with commune members. The cadres of the production team are relatively easy to achieve the first "Three Together's," but it is not easy to consult together, so they should be required to learn to consult with commune members. In this way, proceeding from reality, with different emphases, all cadres can truly achieve the "Four Together's."

    **How to Consult with the Masses**

    Consulting together occupies an important position in the "Four Together's." How do cadres consult with the masses? According to the experience of the cadres of the Luojiachuan Production Team, the following issues must be specifically resolved: (1) Who to consult with? (2) What methods to use to consult? (3) When to consult on what issues? (4) What to do after consulting?

    Who to consult with? This is a question of how to implement the class line. The cadres of the Luojiachuan Production Team regularly consult with two teams: one is 23 old farmers, and the other is 132 Party members, League members, and activists. These two teams form the "staff department" of the cadres, and the vast majority of them are poor and lower-middle peasants. They have high awareness and resolutely support the leadership of the Party and socialism. They also have different characteristics: the old farmers who participate in the technical advisory group have been farming for decades and have rich production experience. Party members, League members, and activists are mostly young people and women. They are energetic and quick to accept new things. By concentrating the opinions of these two groups of people and then consulting with the broad masses of commune members, it is possible to combine the opinions of the leadership with the opinions of the masses and resolutely implement the instructions of the higher authorities in accordance with local conditions. Before sowing spring wheat in February of this year, on the issue of how to reasonably and densely plant, the cadres first consulted with the old farmers and then consulted with the activists. Based on the opinions of the old farmers and the activists, they summarized the experience and lessons of dense planting in previous years and determined that this year, for fertile irrigated land, 28 to 30 jin of seeds should be sown per mu, for less fertile land, 24 to 25 jin of seeds should be sown per mu, and for dry land on the plateau, 12 to 15 jin of seeds should be sown per mu. After the plan was initially determined, the opinions of other commune members were widely solicited through the activists, and a meeting of commune members was held for discussion. In this way, the requirements of reasonable dense planting in the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture were guaranteed to be implemented in accordance with local conditions. Due to reasonable dense planting and the strengthening of field management in the mid-term, the average yield of spring wheat per mu this year increased by 50 to 60 jin compared to last year.

    What methods to use to consult? The methods used by the cadres of the Luojiachuan Production Team to consult with the masses are mainly two: one is to consult in an organized and planned manner; the other is for cadres and activists to contract to teams and households, and consult anytime and anywhere without being constrained by formality. When encountering major issues, such as this time implementing the instructions of the Party Central Committee to vigorously develop grain production, the Party Branch first convened a Party Branch Committee meeting to study, and then successively convened a series of meetings of Party members, League members, old farmers, and activists to consult with everyone in a planned manner. At ordinary times, the branch committee members and production team cadres contract to pieces of land, and the small team cadres and Party members and League members contract to households, and consult with commune members anytime and anywhere in the canteen, in the fields, or in the homes of commune members. Cadres pay special attention to giving play to the role of activists and rely on them to consult with the masses on issues. The 132 activists in the whole team are united around the cadres, and each activist is respectively connected with three to five commune members. These commune members account for 90% of the total number of commune members in the team. In this way, through layer-by-layer contact, when there is work, the cadres consult with the activists, and the activists consult with the commune members. At the first call, there are a hundred responses, and they act quickly. Recently, the commune proposed strengthening autumn field management and striving to produce more grain per mu. Through the activists, it was implemented in one night, and the labor force participating in field production the next day increased by more than one-fifth.

    When to consult on what issues? It is necessary to consult with the masses at all times and on all matters. That is, it is necessary to consult with the masses in the face of every major political task or key production period, and it is also necessary to consult with the masses on some small issues in ordinary production and life. In the "Anti-Drought Production" and "Vigorously Developing Agriculture and Vigorously Developing Grain Production" movements this year, and before spring sowing, summer harvest, autumn field management, and autumn harvest, this team convened meetings of old farmers and activists to study how to implement the Party's instructions, carry out movements, and grow, manage, and harvest well. After the summer harvest, in order to carefully budget and plan grain consumption, the Party Branch promptly consulted with the broad masses of commune members through the old farmers and activists on how to implement planned grain consumption and save grain consumption. When consulting with commune members, the Party's grain policy was publicized, and the bottom line of the canteen was explained. After consulting with the commune members, many ways to save grain were collected. After these methods were implemented, the commune members were guaranteed to eat their fill and eat well, and the nine canteens in the whole team saved more than 3,000 jin of flour within two months. In addition, 50 of the 300 households of commune members had surplus grain.

    What to do after consulting? Consulting with the masses aims to concentrate the wisdom of the masses, enrich leadership, and better implement the Party's policies. After consulting with the masses, the cadres of this production team ensure that every opinion put forward by the masses is implemented. All correct parts are accepted with an open mind and adopted in a timely manner; the reasons are clarified for incorrect parts, whether they are put forward due to a lack of understanding of the situation, or due to being influenced by capitalist ideas. For the former, the situation is explained to make the person who made the suggestion understand why it cannot be adopted, and for the latter, education is carried out. After the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee issued a call for anti-drought production this spring, when Luo Youyuan and others consulted with the old farmers, some people suggested reclaiming and planting scattered wastelands along the edges of canals and roads in irrigated land. The branch adopted this opinion and launched a "six edges" movement to reclaim the edges of roads, villages, land, rivers, canals, and ridges in the whole team. The whole team reclaimed more than 130 mu of wasteland and planted crops and vegetables. The person who made this suggestion also put forward a not-so-correct opinion, saying: "One mu of irrigated land is worth ten mu. Put more effort into irrigated land. No matter how much you work on dry land on the plateau, it won't be of great use." The branch did not adopt this opinion, and while attaching importance to irrigated land, it did not relax the work on dry land. As a result, the summer and autumn fields on the plateau yielded the same increase this year. They treated the opinions of the masses with analysis in this way.

    **How to Ensure that Cadres Truly Achieve the "Four Together's"**

    Luo Youyuan has adhered to implementing the "Four Together's" for ten years as if it were one day, and other cadres in the team have also universally achieved the "Four Together's." The fundamental guarantee is the strong leadership of the Party. In order to ensure that cadres maintain close ties with the masses and adhere to implementing the "Four Together's," the Party Branch has adopted the following measures:

    (1) Continuously strengthen ideological education for cadres and require cadres to put down their airs. This spring, Party Branch Secretary Luo Youyuan heard some commune members complaining about a small number of cadres. Once, when eating in the Fifth Small Team canteen, he came across the administrator losing his temper at a commune member. He immediately criticized the administrator and, afterwards, specially convened a branch committee meeting, deciding to use this incident to educate all cadres and launch a "put down the airs of cadres" movement in the whole team on a large scale. The main contents of this movement are: mobilizing commune members to put forward opinions to cadres, cadres visiting door-to-door to solicit opinions, administrators listening to commune members' feedback on the canteen at the dining table, respecting the old and cherishing the young, and taking old farmers as teachers. After launching this movement, three cadres whose work style and work methods had problems quickly changed. Some elderly people were respected by the cadres, and they said excitedly: "The Party's education is just right."

    (2) Through inspection and evaluation, commend good cadres and criticize and educate poor cadres. The evaluation method is to convene a meeting of all cadres, and self-report and public discussion are conducted based on the standards of the "Four Together's." In a recent evaluation, 35 cadres comprehensively achieved the "Four Together's" and were publicly commended. Seven cadres basically achieved the "Four Together's." On the one hand, their advantages were commended, and at the same time, their shortcomings were pointed out, and they were encouraged to learn from the advanced. For the two worst cadres, they were given more help to help them improve their understanding and correct their shortcomings. Yang Shuming, the deputy leader of the Eighth Small Team, originally had a simple and rigid work style and rarely consulted with the masses on matters. After the evaluation meeting and the help of the branch secretary, his work style changed. He consulted with everyone on matters and asked others for advice when he did not understand. An old commune member in his sixties smiled at him and said: "You have changed these past two days. This change is good." He also said to Branch Secretary Luo Youyuan: "Shuming has changed a lot these past few days. Only in this way can production be led well."

    (3) Mobilize the masses to supervise cadres. On the one hand, the Party Branch educates cadres to rely on the masses in everything, and on the other hand, it educates the masses to establish the attitude of being masters and supervise cadres. There are two ways for the masses to supervise cadres: one is to supervise anytime and anywhere at ordinary times, and put forward shortcomings to the cadres themselves or the Party Branch; the other is when individual cadres make serious mistakes in their work style, they must make a self-criticism in front of the masses. Luo Shihe, the leader of the Third Small Team, once made the mistake of issuing compulsory orders. The Party Branch criticized and educated him, and he made two self-criticisms at the mass meeting. The masses put forward many opinions. When the masses saw that he recognized his mistakes, they said: "It's good to take responsibility for the mistakes." Through the masses supervising anytime and anywhere and concentrating on putting forward opinions to a certain cadre, cadres with shortcomings in their thinking and work style are prompted to be vigilant at all times and constantly make progress.

    **A Thousand Difficulties, Ten Thousand Difficulties, Implementing the "Four Together's" Makes it Not Difficult**

    "A thousand difficulties, ten thousand difficulties, implementing the 'Four Together's' makes it not difficult." This is what Luo Youyuan often says when educating cadres. The meaning of this sentence is: as long as cadres achieve the "Four Together's" and mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, it can generate infinite power, and any difficulties will be overcome. Facts prove that this sentence is completely correct. As a result of the cadres of this production team universally implementing the "Four Together's," the broad masses of commune members love the Party, love socialism, and love the people's commune even more, and they also support the cadres cultivated by the Party. The masses call comrades like Luo Youyuan "trustworthy good cadres." Many commune members said: "The hearts of cadres and commune members are twisted together, and all kinds of work are grasped at the key points. Assigning work is like cutting the line according to the material. The more we work, the more energetic we are." In the movement to vigorously develop agriculture and vigorously develop grain production, commune member Dong Dehai said: "The cadres care about me, how can I not care about the fields?" He works very hard in labor, and he either puts forward criticisms at any time when he sees bad phenomena, or he reports them to the cadres in a timely manner. Luo Youyuan attended a meeting in the province in mid-August, and many commune members often asked: "When will Secretary Luo return?" After he returned from the meeting, male and female commune members rushed to ask about everything. Because the cadres and the masses are of one mind, one heart, and work together, all kinds of difficulties have been overcome by them, and all tasks have been completed quickly and well.

    As soon as the Party issues a call, the masses act immediately, fearing no difficulties. When spring sowing this year, the team lacked fertilizer. After discussion by the masses, each small team immediately organized a fertilizer accumulation commando team, and picked up a large amount of manure from construction sites several miles away, so that each mu of irrigated land was fertilized with an average of 2,700 jin. During the summer harvest, the land on the mountain was far away and inconvenient to transport. Some cadres and commune members moved to the mountain together, lived in the fields, ate in the fields, and returned victoriously after all the harvesting and threshing were completed. In this movement to vigorously develop grain production, more than 80% of the labor force in the whole team went to the first line of production, the attendance rate increased from 90% to 100%, and labor efficiency was also greatly improved. Six commune members of the Fifth Small Team applied 1,800 jin of topdressing fertilizer to eight mu of millet in one morning, while in the past, it would have taken at least one day to do so much work. Many elderly commune members are also equally active and responsible. When the autumn grain was about to ripen, 22 elderly people who could not participate in labor automatically organized to guard crops and vegetables, etc. Old commune member Liu Shengxiu said: "We eat collective food, and everyone should contribute to the society. I signed up to guard the crops and contribute to the vigorous development of grain production." Some also said: "We cannot labor, but we can guard the crops, and reducing waste is our contribution to increasing grain."

    Implementing the "Four Together's" has also improved the leadership level of cadres. Now the cadres of this team work more practically, meticulously, and have methods.

    实行“四同”，力量无穷
    ——介绍罗家川生产队干部实行“四同”的经验
    本报记者　袁光强　喻博文　吴国选
    甘肃省的农村干部，都知道临夏回族自治州有个模范干部叫罗有元。罗有元是临夏市刘家峡公社罗家川生产队的党支部书记，他十年如一日地坚持和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，领导群众改变了当地的落后面貌，生产连年增长。今年7月间，中共临夏回族自治州委员会曾向全州各地发出通知，号召全体干部学习罗有元的工作作风。接着《甘肃日报》详细报道了罗有元的事迹，并引用罗有元常说的一句话“千难万难，实行‘四同’就不难”为题发表了社论。现在，一个学、赶、超罗有元的群众运动正在全临夏自治州广泛深入地展开，甘肃其他各地的农村干部也都以罗有元为榜样，努力改进自己的领导方法和领导作风。
    最近，我们到刘家峡公社访问了罗有元和他领导的罗家川生产队。我们在访问中发现，罗有元不仅自己坚持“四同”，而且以党支部为核心，采取各种办法教育其他干部也普遍做到了“四同”。据他们最近的评比，在四十四名正副小队长以上干部中，“四同”做得较好的干部占80％，另有16％的干部基本上做到了“四同”。由于干部普遍做到了“四同”，群众都衷心爱戴干部，上下一条心，一股劲，保证了各项生产任务完成得又快又好。
    干部和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，这是党的优良作风，也是贯彻群众路线的有效方法。罗家川生产队的干部深切体验到实行“四同”的好处，并且在这方面取得了一套比较完整的经验。
    明确“四同”标准
    全面实现“四同”
    罗家川生产队党支部，领导干部展开“四同”运动的首要一个步骤，是教育大家学习先进，明确“四同”的目标。
    今年8月初，这个生产队和临夏回族自治州其他地区一样，在全体干部中开展了学、赶、超罗有元的运动。运动一开始，党支部就组织干部认真学习了省委、自治州委关于进一步改进领导方法和领导作风的指示，根据指示精神，检查了干部工作中存在的问题。检查时发现有些干部表面上做到了“四同”，实际上没有做到。针对具体情况，支部领导大家以罗有元为活生生的榜样，讨论和制定了实行“四同”的具体标准。这些标准是：
    一、同吃——干部同社员必须在一个食堂吃饭，切实做到同灶、同桌，吃同样的饭、同样的菜。通过同吃，发现食堂中的问题，亲自动手办好食堂，安排好社员生活。同时，还要把食堂当作商量问题的场所，同社员商量解决生产和生活方面的问题。
    二、同住——生产队和生产小队的干部不脱离生产，主要是平时要做到经常访疾问苦，并关心群众的劳逸结合问题。当农活紧需要到野外去安营扎寨时，干部要去和社员同住。通过这些活动，了解社员们的意见、要求，宣传党的方针政策，向社员进行政治思想教育。
    三、同劳动——干部在参加劳动时，要到艰苦的地方去，到活重的地方去，到问题多的地方去；干部参加劳动要认真，和社员一样评工记分。通过同劳动及时发现问题和解决问题，发现和推广新的经验，保证重点任务按时按质按量完成。
    四、同商量——在同吃、同住、同劳动的时候，所有干部必须做到时时和社员商量，事事和社员商量。干部在和社员商量问题时，要放下架子，充分发扬民主。对正确的意见虚心接受，对不正确的意见也不要马上顶回去，可留作参考，并解释清楚。
    有了以上的具体标准之后，接着碰到一个问题，就是有的干部问：同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量这四个方面，究竟那一个方面重要，如何正确掌握它们之间的关系呢。有人认为同劳动重要，有人认为同商量重要。经过大家根据自己的实践进行讨论，明确认识到只有先做到同吃、同住、同劳动，才能使干部和社员同心，才能够做到同商量；做到了同商量以后，社员们的积极性充分调动起来了，劳动中不需要干部经常检查督促了，这样反过来又能够使干部腾出更多的时间参加劳动，促进干部坚持和社员同吃、同住、同劳动。“四同”是贯彻群众路线的有效方法，相互有联系，不能割裂，也不应有所偏废。
    他们有许多事实证明这一点。
    第二生产小队长罗仕典，过去在“四同”上有缺点，有时找群众商量，群众也不向他讲真心话。后来，在党支部的帮助下，他改正了自己的缺点，首先真正做到和社员同吃、同住、同劳动。群众看到他确实有了转变，当他再和群众商量问题时，群众就积极帮他出主意。在给谷子间苗时，有的社员建议贯彻执行小包工制度，他采纳后，群众干劲很大，三天时间就间完了四十多亩，工效提高一倍。
    生产队党支部书记罗有元，是全面实行“四同”的模范。他一贯通过参加生产来领导生产，去年做了一百三十多个劳动日，今年前八个月中又做了七十五个劳动日。他处处关心群众生活，遇事和群众商量，群众都把他当成知心人，有什么心里话都愿意向他说，并且积极帮助他做好工作。今年2月间，他有病住在公社医院里，有几个社员就向他写信反映队里的生产、生活中的问题。在他的周围，有许多社员作他的“顾问”，帮助他考虑问题。因而全队工作样样主动。去年秋收后，老农罗仕昌等人向罗有元提出，趁当时人强畜壮，把今年播种秋粮的地全部提前到去年年底翻完、灌完，给今年春播腾出手脚。罗有元接受了这个建议后，组织劳动力突击翻地和打冰灌水，结果就使今年的春播工作非常主动。今年2月，老农罗仕杰又向罗有元建议，抓紧时间，茬准备种玉米的地里先种上萝卜，争取多收一槎萝卜。罗有元接受这个建议，发动群众种了三百六十七亩，结果收了十五万斤，而且没有耽误种玉米。
    第五生产小队罗发连过去前“三同”做得好，就是不善于和群众同商量。由于不善于和群众商量，群众执行任务心里没有底，积极性不能充分发挥，这样罗发连不得不花费一些时间检查督促，占去了他参加劳动的一些时间。后来，他在党支部的帮助下学会了和群众同商量，做到了千斤担子万人挑，情况就有了改变。他腾出更多的时间参加劳动，过去每月平均做二十三——二十四个劳动日，现在每月可以做二十八个劳动日。
    罗家川生产队干部实行“四同”的经验证明，要使干部全面做到“四同”，在一定时期内应当根据干部的不同情况提出不同的要求。一般说，生产队的干部因为管的面广，事情较多较杂，比较容易放松和社员同劳动，就应当着重要求他们认真做到和社员同劳动。生产小队的干部前“三同”比较容易做到，同商量不容易做到，就应当着重要求他们学会和社员同商量。这样从实际出发，各有侧重，就可以使所有干部真正做到“四同”。
    怎样和群众同商量
    同商量在“四同”中占有重要的地位。干部怎样和群众同商量？根据罗家川生产队干部们的经验，必须具体解决以下几个问题：（1）同什么人商量？（2）用什么方法商量？（3）什么时候商量什么问题？（4）商量了以后怎么办？
    同什么人商量呢？这是个如何贯彻阶级路线的问题。罗家川生产队的干部经常商量问题的有两支队伍：一支是二十三个老农，一支是一百三十二名党、团员和积极分子。这两支队伍形成了干部的“参谋部”，其中绝大部分人都是贫农和下中农。他们觉悟高，坚决拥护党的领导，拥护社会主义。他们又各有不同的特点：参加技术顾问小组的老农，都种了几十年庄稼，有着丰富的生产经验。党、团员和积极分子，绝大部分是青年和妇女，他们干劲大，接受新鲜事物快。把这两部分人的意见集中起来，再经过和广大社员商量，就能做到领导意见和群众意见相结合，因地制宜地坚决贯彻上级的指示。今年2月种春麦前，对如何合理密植问题，干部就先找老农商量，后又找积极分子商量。他们根据老农和积极分子的意见，总结了往年密植的经验和教训，确定今年水地肥力强的每亩下种二十八斤到三十斤，肥力差的每亩下种二十四斤到二十五斤，塬上旱地每亩下种十二斤到十五斤。方案初步确定以后，再通过积极分子广泛征求其他社员的意见，并召开社员大会讨论。这样，就保证因地制宜地贯彻了农业“八字宪法”中关于合理密植的要求。由于做到了合理密植以及中期加强了田间管理，今年春小麦平均每亩比去年增产五、六十斤。
    用什么方法商量呢？罗家川生产队干部和群众商量的方法主要有两种：一种是有组织、有计划地商量；另一种是干部和积极分子分队包片包干，不拘形式随时随地商量。遇到重大问题如这次贯彻党中央大办粮食的指示，就首先召开党支委会研究，然后先后召开党员、团员、老农、积极分子等一系列的会议，有计划地同大家商量。在平时，支委和生产队干部包片，小队干部和党、团员包户，在食堂、田头或社员家里，随时随地和社员商量。干部特别注意发挥积极分子的作用，依靠他们和群众商量问题。全队一百三十二名积极分子团结在干部的周围，每个积极分子又分别联系三至五名社员，这些社员占全队社员总数的90％。这样层层联系，有了工作时干部找积极分子商量，积极分子找社员商量，一呼百应，很快就行动起来。最近公社提出加强秋田管理，争取每亩多打一些粮食的要求，通过积极分子，一个晚上就贯彻下去，第二天参加田间生产的劳动力就增加了五分之一多。
    什么时候商量什么问题？要时时、事事都和群众商量。即在每一个重大的政治任务面前或生产关键时期要同群众商量，在平时生产、生活上的一些细小问题上也要同群众商量。在今年“抗旱生产”、“大办农业、大办粮食”等运动中和春播、夏收、秋田管理、秋收之前，这个队都召开了老农和积极分子会议，研究如何贯彻党的指示，开展运动和种好、管好、收好的问题。夏收以后，为了精打细算，计划用粮，党支部及时通过老农和积极分子，同广大社员商量如何贯彻执行计划用粮和节约用粮的问题。在同社员商量时，宣传了党的粮食政策，并交代了食堂的家底。经过和社员同商量，汇集了许多节约粮食的办法。这些办法实行以后，保证了社员吃饱吃好，两个月时间内全队九个食堂就节约了三千多斤面粉，另外三百户社员中有五十户节余了粮食。
    商量以后怎么办？和群众同商量，目的是集中群众的智慧，丰富领导，更好地贯彻党的政策。这个生产队干部和群众商量了以后，对群众提出的意见做到件件有着落，凡是正确的部分，都虚心接受，及时采用；不正确的部分分清原因，是由于不了解情况提出的，还是由于受了资本主义思想影响而提出的。对待前者说明情况，使提意见的人了解为什么不能采用，对待后者进行教育。今春中共甘肃省委发出抗旱生产的号召以后，罗有元等人同老农在一起商量时，有人提出把水地的渠边、路边零星荒地开垦种植。支部采纳了这个意见，在全队开展了开垦路边、庄边、地边、河边、渠边、埂边的“六边”运动。全队共开出荒地一百三十多亩，种上了庄稼和蔬菜。提出这个意见的人同时还提出了不大正确的意见，说：“水地一亩顶十亩，多在水地下工夫，塬上旱地再加工也顶不了大事。”支部没有采纳这种意见，既重视水地，又没有放松旱地的加工。结果，今年塬上的夏田、秋田同样的增了产。他们就是这样有分析地对待群众的意见。
    怎样保证干部真正做到“四同”
    罗有元十年如一日地坚持实行“四同”，队里其他干部也普遍做到“四同”，根本保证是党的坚强领导。党支部为了保证干部经常密切联系群众，坚持实行“四同”，采取了以下几项措施：
    （一）不断对干部加强思想教育，要求干部放下架子。今年春天，支部书记罗有元听到一些社员对少数干部有意见，有一次到第五小队食堂吃饭时，碰上管理员向一个社员发脾气。他即时向这个管理员提出了批评，并在事后专门召开了支委会，决定用这件事教育全体干部，在全队大张旗鼓地开展一个“放下干部架子”的运动。这个运动的主要内容是：发动社员给干部提意见，干部登门访问征求意见，管理员到饭桌上倾听社员对食堂的反映，尊老爱幼、拜老农为师。开展这个运动后，原来工作作风、工作方法有毛病的三个干部，很快地转变过来了。有些老年人受到干部的尊敬，他们激动地说：“党的教育就是顶事。”
    （二）通过检查评比，表扬好的干部，批评和教育差的干部。评比的方法是召开全体干部大会，根据“四同”的标准，自报公议。在最近的一次评比中，有三十五名干部全面做到“四同”，当众给予了表扬。有七名干部基本上做到了“四同”，一方面表扬他们的优点，同时指出他们不够的地方，鼓励他们向先进看齐。对两名最差的干部，则给他们更多的帮助，帮助他们提高认识，改正缺点。第八小队的副队长杨述明原来工作作风简单生硬，遇事很少同群众商量，经过评比会议和支部书记的帮助后，作风有了转变，遇事和大家一块商量，不懂的就向别人请教。六十多岁的老社员见了他笑着说：“你这两天变了，这变的好。”并对支部书记罗有元说：“述明这几天改变的有样子了，像这样才能把生产领导好。”
    （三）发动群众对干部实行监督。党支部一方面教育干部事事依靠群众，同时教育群众树立主人翁的态度，对干部实行监督。群众监督干部的方法有两种，一种是平时随时随地监督，看到缺点就向干部本人或党支部提出；另一种是当个别干部在作风上犯了严重错误的时候，要他在群众面前作检讨。第三小队队长罗仕和有一次犯了强迫命令的错误，党支部对他进行了批评教育，他在群众会上作了两次检查，群众提了很多意见。群众看到他认识了自己的错误，就说：“错了承当就好了。”通过群众随时随地监督和集中对某一个干部提意见，就促使思想作风有缺点的干部，时时警惕，不断得到进步。
    千难万难实行“四同”就不难
    “千难万难，实行‘四同’就不难。”这是罗有元教育干部时常说的一句话。这句话的意思是：只要干部做到“四同”，把群众的积极性调动起来，就能产生无穷的力量，任何困难都会被克服。事实证明这句话完全正确。这个生产队干部普遍实行“四同”的结果，广大社员更加热爱党、热爱社会主义，热爱人民公社，也拥护党培养出来的干部，群众称罗有元等同志为“信得过的好干部”。许多社员说：“干部和社员的心拧在一起了，样样活都抓在节骨眼上，派活是照材料下线，我们越干越有劲。”大办农业、大办粮食运动中，社员董得海说：“干部关心我，我不关心田间还行。”他在劳动中很努力，看到不良现象不是随时提出批评，就是及时向干部反映。罗有元8月中旬在省里开会，许多社员常问：“罗书记什么时候回来？”他开会回来后，男女社员纷纷跑来问长问短。由于干部同群众一条心，一股劲，同心协力，各种困难都被他们克服了，各项任务都完成得又快又好。
    党一发出号召，群众就立即行动，不怕任何困难。今年春播时，队里缺肥料，经过群众讨论后，各小队立即组织了积肥突击队，到几里路以外的工地，拾来了大量粪肥，使每亩水地平均施肥二千七百斤。夏收时，山上的地远，运送不方便，部分干部、社员就一起搬到山上，住在地头，吃在地头，到全部收碾完毕后胜利归来。在这次大办粮食运动中，全队80％以上的劳动力走上了生产第一线，出勤率由90％提高到百分之百，劳动效率也大大提高。第五小队六个社员，在一个上午给八亩谷子追肥一千八百斤，而在过去，干这样多的活，至少需要一天时间。许多老年社员也同样积极负责。秋粮快成熟时，有二十二个不能参加劳动的老人，自动组织起来看守庄稼和蔬菜等。老社员刘升秀说：“我们吃的是集体饭，大家都要为社出力。我报名看庄稼，为大办粮食出点力气。”有的还说：“我们不能劳动，可以看庄稼，少糟踏一些也就是我们为增加粮食出了力了。”
    实行“四同”也提高了干部的领导水平。现在这个队的干部工作更加踏实、细致、有办法。
