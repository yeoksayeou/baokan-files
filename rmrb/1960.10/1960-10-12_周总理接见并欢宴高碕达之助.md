Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Premier Zhou Enlai received Takasaki Tatsunosuke, the former chief Japanese delegate to the Bandung Conference, and his entourage this afternoon and held friendly talks.

Present at the reception were Zhang Xiruo, Zhang Hanfu, Lei Renmin, Xue Muqiao, Tong Xiaopeng, Zhao Anbo, and others.

The Japanese peace advocate in Beijing, Kinkazu Saionji, was also present.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Premier Zhou Enlai held a banquet at the Great Hall of the People tonight to welcome Takasaki Tatsunosuke, the former chief Japanese delegate to the Bandung Conference, and his entourage.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the banquet, first expressing his great pleasure in reuniting with Mr. Takasaki Tatsunosuke, a colleague and friend from the Bandung Conference, in Beijing today after a long separation. He also welcomed the Japanese economic figures accompanying Mr. Takasaki on their visit to China.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that, as Mr. Takasaki Tatsunosuke stated upon arriving in Beijing yesterday, Sino-Japanese relations have been in an unnatural state for the fifteen years since the war. However, this responsibility does not lie with the Chinese side.

He pointed out that the people of China and Japan are willing to be friendly with each other. What the Chinese people are concerned about is that a small number of Japanese rulers are relying on foreign forces, attempting to revive Japanese militarism, and endangering peace in the Far East. However, we believe that the Japanese people, with their tradition of national independence, sense of national self-respect, and desire for peace, are opposed to the revival of Japanese militarism and are willing to restore normal relations between China and Japan. These aspirations of the Japanese people are the same as those of the Chinese people.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that we are very pleased to see that the friendly relations between the people of China and Japan are expanding day by day, and friendly exchanges are increasing day by day, which will greatly contribute to peace in the Far East, Asia, and the world.

Premier Zhou Enlai emphasized that China is willing to restore normal relations between China and Japan and promote friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and Japan based upon the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference.

He then reiterated three basic conditions for improving Sino-Japanese relations. These conditions are: first, there should be no mutual hostility; China is not hostile to Japan, and Japan should not be hostile to China; second, China recognizes Japan, and Japan should not follow the United States and participate in the "two Chinas" plot; third, there should be no obstruction but rather promotion of the development of Sino-Japanese relations in the direction of normalization.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the people of China and Japan both have such aspirations, therefore, the authorities of both countries should improve Sino-Japanese relations based on these three basic conditions. He concluded by saying that he welcomed Mr. Takasaki to explore all possible ways to improve Sino-Japanese relations in his personal capacity on the basis of the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference.

Takasaki Tatsunosuke spoke at the banquet. He said that since the Bandung Conference five years ago, he had been looking forward to visiting China, and now this wish has finally been realized, which will be unforgettable for him.

He also said that he toured the city of Beijing this morning, and compared to what he saw twenty years ago, the Chinese people, under the leadership of their outstanding leaders, have done incredible things, which surprised him very much.

Takasaki Tatsunosuke said that from here, we can see that only with good leadership can a good country be built, which is something that we Japanese should consider.

He also said that Premier Zhou Enlai just mentioned that Sino-Japanese relations are in an abnormal state, which he felt sincerely regrettable. Especially since he participated in the signing of the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, he felt even greater responsibility.

He said that he completely agreed with Premier Zhou Enlai's statement that the responsibility for the abnormal state of Sino-Japanese relations does not lie with the Chinese side. He was willing to say on behalf of the Japanese people that this is also not the responsibility of the Japanese people. Where exactly does this responsibility lie? This is what he wanted to explore with Premier Zhou Enlai frankly and sincerely.

He said that all members of their delegation to China are willing to work to find ways to eliminate the clouds covering Sino-Japanese relations.

Takasaki Tatsunosuke concluded by saying that he was willing to devote the rest of his life to improving Sino-Japanese relations.

Those present at the banquet included Guo Moruo, Zhang Xiruo, Li Dequan, Cai Tingkai, Wang Zhen, Zhang Hanfu, Hu Yuzhi, Chu Tunan, Xu Guangping, Li Jiebo, Lian Guan, Tong Xiaopeng, Wu Defeng, Xue Muqiao, Ji Chaoding, Shen Zijiu, Yang Hansheng, Mei Lanfang, Ouyang Yuqian, Wu Maosun, Xie Nanguang, Zhao Anbo, Xie Bingxin, Yong Longgui, Yang Zheng, Ding Tuo, as well as people from all walks of life in the capital.

The Japanese peace advocate in Beijing, Kinkazu Saionji, and his wife were also invited to attend the banquet. (Attached Picture)

    新华社11日讯　周恩来总理今天下午接见了前出席万隆会议的日本首席代表高碕达之助和他的随行人员，并且进行了友好的谈话。
    接见时在座的，有张奚若、章汉夫、雷任民、薛暮桥、童小鹏、赵安博等。
    在京的日本和平人士西园寺公一也在座。
    新华社11日讯　周恩来总理今晚在人民大会堂举行宴会，欢迎前出席万隆会议的日本首席代表高碕达之助和他的随行人员。
    周恩来总理在宴会上讲话，他首先对作为万隆会议的同事和朋友的高碕达之助先生，久别重逢，今天能在北京欢聚，表示非常高兴。他同时还对随同高碕先生来的日本经济界人士到中国参观访问，表示欢迎。
    周恩来总理说，正如高碕达之助先生昨天到达北京时所说的，战后十五年来，中日两国关系处于不自然的状态中。但是，这个责任不在中国方面。
    他指出，中日两国人民是愿意彼此友好的。中国人民所担心的是日本少数统治者依靠外来力量，企图复活日本军国主义，危害远东和平。但是，我们相信，具有民族独立传统、民族自尊感和和平愿望的日本人民，是反对日本军国主义复活的，是愿意恢复中日两国正常关系的。日本人民这些愿望是同中国人民的愿望相同的。
    周恩来总理说，我们很高兴地看到中日两国人民之间的友好关系正在一天天扩大，友好来往正在一天天增加，这将大大有助于远东、亚洲和世界的和平。
    周恩来总理强调指出，中国方面愿意根据和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则，来恢复中日两国的正常关系，促进中日两国人民的友好合作。
    他接着重申了改善中日两国关系的起码条件。这些条件是：一、不应互相敌视，中国并不敌视日本，日本不应敌视中国；二、中国承认日本，日本不应追随美国，参预搞“两个中国”的阴谋；三、不应阻挠而应促进中日两国关系向着正常化的方向发展。
    周恩来总理说，中日两国人民都有这样的愿望，因此，两国当局应该根据这三个起码条件来改善中日两国的关系。他最后说，他欢迎高碕先生以个人身份在万隆会议十项原则的基础上，来探讨改善中日关系的一切可能办法。
    高碕达之助在宴会上讲话。他说，自从万隆会议后，五年来，他一直期望访问中国，现在这个愿望终于实现了，这将使他终生难忘。
    他还说，今天上午游览了北京的市容，这同他二十年前看到的北京比较，中国人民在他们卓越的领导人领导下作出了难以置信的事情，使我感到非常惊讶。
    高碕达之助说，从这里，我们可以看到只要有了好的领导，才能建设好的国家，这是我们日本应该考虑的。
    他还说，刚才周恩来总理说到，中日关系处于不正常的状态，使我感到衷心的遗憾。特别是我参加了签订万隆会议十项原则，更使我感到责任重大。
    他说，周恩来总理刚才说的中日两国处于不正常状态的责任不是在中国方面，我是完全同意的。我愿意代表日本人民说，这也不是日本人民的责任。这个责任究竟在什么地方，这是我要同周恩来总理推心置腹进行探讨的。
    他说，我们这次来中国访问的全体成员都愿意为寻找消除遮盖在中日关系上的乌云而努力。
    高碕达之助最后说，我愿意把今后余生用在改善中日关系上。
    出席宴会的有郭沫若、张奚若、李德全、蔡廷锴、王震、章汉夫、胡愈之、楚图南、许广平、李颉伯、连贯、童小鹏、吴德峰、薛暮桥、冀朝鼎、沈兹九、阳翰笙、梅兰芳、欧阳予倩、吴茂荪、谢南光、赵安博、谢冰心、勇龙桂、杨正、丁拓，以及首都各方面人士。
