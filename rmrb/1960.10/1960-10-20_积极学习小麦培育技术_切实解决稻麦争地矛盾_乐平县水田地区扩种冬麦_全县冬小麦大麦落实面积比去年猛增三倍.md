(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 19th dispatch) Can winter wheat be extensively cultivated and well-grown in the southern paddy field areas? The fact that Leping County, Jiangxi Province, has increased its wheat and barley planting area from 50,000 mu last year to 200,000 mu this year provides a strong answer to this question and provides experience for expanding grain crop production in the South during the winter planting season.

Leping County's approach to large-scale wheat cultivation is: First, enable the masses and cadres in the new wheat-growing areas to master wheat cultivation techniques; thoroughly resolve the conflicts between rice and wheat competing for time and between winter and summer crops competing for land; build residential points in remote Longshan Ao's large paddy fields to strengthen production management of wheat; establish a system of high-yield responsibility for field managers and plot managers in large fields; and ensure sufficient labor for wheat from sowing to management.

Before 1957, Leping County did not grow wheat. All overwintering crops were green manure and rapeseed. In the past two years, sporadic drylands in some areas began to sow 50,000 mu of wheat and barley due to insufficient water sources in autumn and winter or concerns about not catching up with the rice planting season. However, due to backward cultivation techniques and a lack of management experience, the average yield per mu was less than 100 jin. This year, in order to implement the spirit of vigorously developing grain production throughout the year, it was decided to increase the planting of wheat and barley by 200,000 mu in the 600,000 mu of various crops. However, the enthusiasm of the masses and cadres for vigorously developing grain production was high, and they overcame the many difficulties encountered one by one, ensuring that all wheat and barley sowing plans were implemented in the contracted units.

To solve the difficulty of insufficient wheat seeds, the entire county saved all the wheat harvested this year, without eating any wheat for four months, solving the problem of 1.2 million jin of wheat seeds. Subsequently, more than 30 wheat cultivation technology training classes were established, using both external learning and local training methods, enabling more than 3,000 cadres and commune members to initially master wheat cultivation techniques. At the same time, under the requirement of "making fertilizer ourselves when there is no fertilizer," a blitz of fertilizer accumulation was launched, not only preparing 50 dan of basal fertilizer such as grass ash for each mu of wheat and manufacturing a large amount of "man-made manure," but also preparing "man-made manure" and other topdressing for wheat management.

Can wheat be grown on a large scale in paddy field areas, and can high yields be achieved after planting? These were two questions raised by some of the masses regarding the large-scale wheat cultivation this year. These two questions were carefully discussed by the masses and cadres during the implementation of the wheat sowing plan, and a consensus was reached. That is: not only can we plant more, but we can also achieve high yields. However, many problems must be solved to achieve both more planting and high yields.

Using the wheat production experience of other provinces, other counties, and this local area to arm the cadres and masses of the new wheat-growing areas with wheat cultivation techniques is an important measure for expanding winter planting and striving for high yields in paddy field areas. Before the wheat sowing, Leping County, led by the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, organized a large number of cadres and experienced farmers to learn wheat cultivation methods and management systems in the key wheat-producing areas of Sichuan Province. At the same time, they went to Jinxian County, a famous wheat-producing area in this province, to learn the experience of cultivating wheat on red soil. After returning from learning, these advanced experiences were widely disseminated to commune and county-level related cadres, and multiple studies and research were carried out, enabling all cadres leading wheat production to initially master wheat cultivation techniques. Subsequently, more than 30 wheat cultivation technology training classes were established, enriching the wheat production knowledge of more than 2,000 farmers and turning all commune members in the wheat-growing areas into all-rounders in rice and wheat production. Now they have used the advanced experience they have learned to change the local method of dibbling wheat to row planting and wide-ditch row planting.

One of the fundamental reasons why wheat production in the paddy field areas and dryland areas of Leping County has not developed rapidly has been that the two major contradictions of rice and wheat competing for time and winter and summer crops competing for land have not been resolved. This year, the county adopted two measures to solve the contradiction of rice and wheat competing for time. These two measures are: transplanting early rice; and changing dry seedlings to water seedlings. Transplanting early rice means storing the early rice seedlings in the rows of early rice, and then transplanting them from the rows of early rice to the wheat fields for planting after the wheat is harvested. Changing dry seedlings to water seedlings means storing the early rice seedlings in the nursery fields and constantly promoting the growth of the seedlings in situ with sufficient water and fertilizer. In this way, the time that early rice is occupied by wheat can be compensated for by the method of storing seedlings. Thus, paddy fields can grow wheat in winter and rice in spring, harvesting an extra season of grain. This year, in areas with less land and more people, sufficient fertilizer, and good soil quality in Leping County, the wheat planting method in paddy fields has increased the wheat area by 50,000 mu. In addition, the solution to the contradiction of rice and wheat competing for time in areas with more land and fewer people and poor soil quality is to plant barley that matures early and does not affect the transplanting of early rice next spring. In order to expand the wheat planting area, the county, according to the suggestions of the masses, adopted the method of intercropping wheat in eight kinds of summer crops, solving the contradiction of winter and summer crops competing for land. The "eight intercropping" refers to intercropping wheat in the fields of eight crops such as green manure, cotton, and vegetables, and most of the intercropping has now been completed.

Whether in mountainous areas or plains, Leping County has a concentrated population and scattered land. Due to the scattered land and concentrated population, it brings a lot of inconvenience to the management of wheat fields, which is one of the reasons for the rough cultivation of wheat and the vulnerability of crops to trampling by beasts and birds, resulting in low yields. This year, the county also adjusted according to the distribution of wheat, and built more than 1,000 newly established residential points, including pig raising, cattle raising, and fertilizer making, in more than 500 large mountain valleys and large fields. In addition, Leping County, based on the characteristics of not having much experience in wheat planting, adopted a method of establishing a system of responsibility for plot managers and field managers in large plots and large fields to strengthen the leadership of wheat production.

In order to ensure sufficient labor for wheat sowing and management, the county also readjusted the manpower of commune-run industries and water conservancy projects to ensure sufficient labor during the winter wheat sowing period.

Due to the thorough resolution of the above problems, the planned wheat sowing area of the county increased by 150,000 mu, and more than 1.2 million jin of wheat seeds were sent to the production units two solar terms earlier, and 50 dan of fertilizer per mu had been carried to the fields, and sowing had begun.

    积极学习小麦培育技术　切实解决稻麦争地矛盾
    乐平县水田地区扩种冬麦
    全县冬小麦大麦落实面积比去年猛增三倍
    本报南昌19日电　南方水田地区能不能大种小麦、种好小麦？江西乐平县今年大、小麦播种面积由去年五万亩落实到二十万亩的事实，有力地回答了这个问题，而且为南方在冬种中扩大粮食作物生产提供了经验。
    乐平县大种小麦的作法是：首先让新麦区广大群众和干部掌握小麦栽培技术；彻底解决稻麦争时、和冬夏作物争田矛盾；在偏僻的龙山坳里大畈田中广建居住点，以加强对小麦的生产管理；在大畈大丘建立畈长、丘长高产责任制；保证小麦从播种到管理都有足够劳动力。
    乐平县在1957年以前是不种小麦的，全部越冬作物都是绿肥、油菜。近两年来部分地区的零星旱地，由于秋冬水源不足或担心赶不上种稻季节，才开始播种了五万亩大小麦，但因栽培技术落后和管理经验缺乏，每亩平均产量不到百斤。今年，为把大办粮食的精神贯彻全年，决定在六十万多亩各种作物中增种二十万亩大、小麦。由于从领导到群众都缺乏小麦栽培技术，因而播种准备工作遇到了不少困难。但是，广大群众和干部大办粮食的热情高涨，逐一地克服了遇到的许多困难，使全部大小麦播种计划都落实到包产单位。
    为解决麦种不足的困难，全县经过四个月不吃小麦，即把今年所收获的小麦全部节省下来，解决了一百二十万斤麦种的问题。接着，又以外地学、本地训的方法，办起了三十多个小麦栽培技术训练班，使三千多名干部和社员初步掌握了小麦栽培技术。同时又在“没有肥料自己造”的要求下，开展了突击积肥运动周，既为每亩小麦备齐了五十担草木灰等基肥，造制了大量“人造粪”，又为小麦管理准备了“人造粪”等追肥。
    水田地区能不能大种小麦，种了以后能不能高产？是部分群众对今年大种小麦提出的两个问题。这两个问题经广大群众和干部在落实小麦播种计划中认真讨论，得出了一致的认识。这就是：不但能多种，而且也能高产。但是实现多种和高产必须解决许多问题。
    运用外省、外县和本地的小麦丰产经验，武装新麦区干部群众的小麦栽培技术，是水田地区扩大冬种和争取高产的一项重要措施。乐平县在小麦播种以前，就以县委第一书记为首，组织了大批干部和老农到四川省各小麦重点产区，学习了小麦栽培方法和管理制度。同时又到本省小麦著名产区进贤县，学习在红土壤上栽培小麦的经验。取经回来后，即把这些先进经验向公社和县一级有关干部广泛传授，并开展了多次学习研究，使全部领导小麦生产的干部初步掌握了小麦栽培技术。接着又开办了三十多个小麦栽培技术训练班，从而丰富了两千多农民的小麦生产知识，使所有种麦区的社员成了稻麦生产多面手。现在他们已运用学习的先进经验，把本地点播小麦的方法改为条播和宽沟条 播。
    乐平县水田地区和旱田地区小麦生产，一直没有得到迅速发展的根本原因之一，就是稻麦争时，冬夏作物争田的两大矛盾没有解决。今年这个县采取两项措施，解决了稻麦争时的矛盾。这两项措施是：早稻移植；改旱秧为水秧。早稻移植，就是把早稻秧苗寄存在早稻行间，待小麦收割后，再从早稻行间移植到小麦田里栽插。改旱秧为水秧，即是把早稻秧苗寄在秧田里，并经常以充分的水肥促使秧苗就地生长。这样，早稻被小麦占去的时间，就可从寄秧的办法中得到弥补。从而使水田在冬季能够种麦，春季能够种稻，多收了一季粮。今年，乐平县在这种地少人多、肥料充足、土质又好的地区，实行水田种麦办法后，就使小麦面积增加了五万亩。此外，田多人少、土质较差的地区，解决稻麦争时的办法，是种成熟期早、不影响明春早稻插秧的大麦。这个县为了扩大种麦面积，根据广大群众的献计，采取了在八种夏季作物中套种小麦的方法，解决了冬夏作物争田的矛盾。“八套”即在绿肥、棉花、蔬菜等八种作物田里套种小麦，现已大部套种完毕。
    乐平县无论山区、平原，都是人口集中土地分散。由于土地分散、人口集中，给管理麦田带来很多不便，这是造成小麦耕作粗糙、庄稼容易遭受兽雀践踏，以致产量低的一个原因。今年，这个县又按小麦分布情况进行了调整，并在五百多个大山坳里、大田畈里新建了一千多个包括有养猪、养牛、造肥的新设置的居住点。此外，乐平县还根据种麦经验不多的特点，采取了一项在大丘、大畈中建立丘长畈长责任制的方法，以加强对小麦生产的领导。
    为了保证小麦播种、管理有足够劳动力，这个县又重新调整了社办工业、水利工程的人力，保证冬播小麦期间有足够劳动力。
    由于以上问题的彻底解决，就使全县计划小麦播种面积多增了十五万亩，而且提早两个节令把一百多万斤麦种送到了生产单位，每亩五十担肥料也都已挑上田头，并开始了播种。
