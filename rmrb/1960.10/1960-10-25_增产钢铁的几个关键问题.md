Several Key Issues in Increasing Steel Production
Li Renzhi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Since the beginning of this year, the situation on the entire industrial front in Anhui Province has been very good. Industrial production, transportation, and basic construction have continued to maintain a high rate of development and have achieved new and significant accomplishments. The grand-scale technical innovation and technical revolution movements are rich in content and have achieved remarkable results, and are developing more deeply. Many new developments and improvements have been made in various "small-scale modern groups" and "small-scale indigenous groups" enterprises. The broad masses of workers are in high spirits, full of vigor, and high in morale. All of these circumstances demonstrate that, under the illumination of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the industrial front of Anhui Province, like all other fronts, has consistently maintained a great situation of sustained leap forward, on the basis of the comprehensive leap forward of the national economy in the past two years.

Under the guidance of the principle of "taking steel as the key link and promoting overall leap forward," Anhui Province's steel industry has achieved leap after leap this year. One characteristic is the large magnitude of growth. From January to September this year, compared with the same period last year, steel production increased by 1.4 times, iron increased by 59.5%, steel materials increased by 13.9 times, and coal increased by 22%. Transportation volume also increased accordingly by 53.2%. The amount of pig iron transferred out increased by 14.8%. These figures vividly show that Anhui Province's steel industry and other industrial production are developing not only at a high speed of the Great Leap Forward, but also in a planned and proportional manner. Another characteristic is that various technical and economic indicators have been further improved. Not only has steel production increased significantly, but product quality has also been further improved, variety has further increased, utilization coefficient has further increased, and costs have been further reduced; basically meeting the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. Yet another characteristic is that technical reforms are more comprehensive and systematic. The technical transformation of "small-scale modern groups" in the steel industry has developed from sporadic single-item reforms to the reform of the entire production process, greatly improving the degree of "four-izations" (mechanization, automation, semi-automation, and using new technologies and materials). For example, the "small-scale modern groups" in iron smelting have universally carried out comprehensive transformations of the transportation, crushing, charging, air supply, and gas systems. Due to the large-scale technical transformation, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has been greatly improved, work efficiency has been increased, and labor has been saved. Many enterprises have not only achieved increased production without increasing manpower, but have also achieved increased production with reduced manpower.

Anhui Province's steel industry, which continues to develop at a high speed, has already achieved great achievements this year. However, we must not be complacent in the slightest. Although the achievements in steel production in the first three quarters of this year are indeed great, the production tasks in the fourth quarter are even more arduous than before. At the same time, we must see that there are still some shortcomings and difficulties in our work: some weak links in production still need to be further strengthened; the level of enterprise management still cannot adapt to the needs of production development. The task before us is to take advantage of the excellent situation, make persistent efforts, mobilize all available forces, utilize all available factors, and deeply carry out the increase production and practice economy movement centered on steel, promote the sustained and significant growth of steel production, and strive to complete this year's steel production increase task ahead of schedule.

This year's task of increasing steel production is arduous, but also glorious. We must complete this task, and we will certainly be able to complete this task. At present, there are many favorable conditions for completing the steel production task. First, the whole Party is determined. Since the Party Central Committee called for the development of the increase production and practice economy movement centered on grain and steel, leading comrades at all levels of the province have been determined and have universally and conscientiously strengthened the leadership of steel production; the vast majority of cadres have gone deep into the front line of production, enriching and strengthening the leadership at the grassroots level. Second, a new upsurge of increase production and practice economy has already formed. The broad masses of people have warmly responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and are working day and night to increase steel production this year, and the level of production is gradually improving. Third, the production level of raw materials and transportation capacity have been further improved. After a series of measures were taken by the coal mines, the production level has risen more and more significantly; after a series of technical transformations by the mines, ore production has greatly increased; the amount of coal and ore transported out has greatly increased. Fourth, a number of new construction projects have been put into production one after another, and production capacity has been further enhanced. As long as we make good use of these conditions, give full play to subjective initiative, and work hard and diligently, it is entirely possible to overfulfill this year's steel production task.

How should we overfulfill this year's steel production task? Strengthening political and ideological work and continuously improving the political consciousness of the broad masses of workers is the primary guarantee for overfulfilling this year's steel production task. The broad masses of workers in factories and mines throughout the province, for the current excellent political and economic situation, for the great significance of carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement centered on grain and steel, the understanding of the vast majority of people is clear. With soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, they have actively invested in this movement, determined to work hard, practically and skillfully, and resolutely overfulfill this year's steel production task. This is the ideological mainstream of the broad masses of workers at present. However, at present, there are also a few workers who do not fully understand the great significance of the current increase production and practice economy movement, and ideological education should be further strengthened.

Some people believe: "The increase production plan must be completed, but it does not matter much whether the economy plan is completed or not." They only value production and ignore economy. This view of opposing increase production and economy is incorrect. Of course, valuing production is entirely correct, but ignoring economy is incorrect. Increase production and economy are the basic principles for building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and are two aspects of one issue. Only by both increasing production and economizing can we achieve the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. Only focusing on production and not focusing on economy, arbitrarily wasting the fruits of production, will lose the role of increasing production and will not achieve the goal of more, faster, better, and more economical. Conversely, if the economy work is done well, reducing the waste of raw materials and labor, we can produce more things with the same material resources and manpower, achieve greater production increases, and promote faster development of production. At present, one of the key issues in increasing steel production is to ensure the supply of raw materials, and to solve this problem, on the one hand, we need to vigorously increase production, and on the other hand, we must rely on economy. If the coke ratio of iron smelting in the province can be reduced by 6%, more than 70,000 tons of pig iron can be smelted this year; if the steel consumption can be reduced by 10%, nearly 20,000 tons more steel can be smelted this year. From this, it can be seen that to fully and effectively implement the General Line, we must vigorously grasp economy while vigorously grasping production.

Some units felt that the time was short and the tasks were heavy because the production tasks in the previous period were not completed well enough, and thus some fear of difficulty arose. Other units had completed the production tasks well in the previous period and still had the potential to increase production, but did not want to increase production as much as possible. These two kinds of thinking are not in line with the spirit of exerting full effort and striving for upstream. It should be recognized that there are always difficulties in work. The so-called difficulty is the contradiction in the development of objective things. Without contradictions, things cannot develop. The key is not whether there are difficulties, but how to exert full effort to overcome difficulties. In Anhui Province's steel production, some enterprises have poor conditions, but production has exceeded enterprises with good conditions. Even in the same enterprise, the equipment and personnel have not changed, but under the conditions of exerting full effort and not exerting full effort, two completely different production situations have emerged. When full effort is exerted, production rises immediately, and when fear of difficulty and relaxation of effort occurs, production decreases immediately. This powerfully shows that the mental state of people plays a decisive role in the development of production. Moreover, our existing production conditions, whether in terms of equipment capacity, raw material supply, technical strength, or leadership experience, are much better than in the past, and it is entirely possible to achieve the increase production task. Therefore, any fear of difficulty is unfounded and must be overcome quickly. As for some units that have very good production conditions and great potential, but do not plan to increase production as much as possible, this is actually a manifestation of conservative thinking. Every revolutionary should strive for upstream in accordance with the requirements of continuous revolution, and those who have the conditions to increase production more must strive to increase production more. At the same time, it should be recognized that in the production process, the development of various enterprises is unbalanced. Some units have completed the plan better, and some units cannot complete the plan on time due to various reasons. This requires those enterprises with good production conditions to increase production as much as possible, so as to ensure the comprehensive realization of the increase production plan.

Some people also believe: "Running agriculture in a big way is the business of rural people's communes, and running steel in a big way is the business of steel plants. I neither engage in agriculture nor engage in steel, so running grain and steel in a big way has nothing to do with me." This idea is obviously wrong. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly taught us that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, grain is the foundation of the foundation, and steel is the "grain" of industry and the material foundation of agricultural mechanization and agricultural basic construction. With more grain and steel, everything will be easy to handle. The speed of grain and steel development is directly related to the development speed of the entire national economy. The reason why Anhui Province's various construction undertakings have been able to achieve high-speed development is precisely because of the implementation of the results of taking grain as the key link and steel as the key link. The development of grain and steel is so closely and significantly related to each department, how can it be said that "it has nothing to do with me"? The entire national economy is an organic whole, and the entire industrial production is also an organic whole. In carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement centered on grain and steel, all workers in industrial departments have something to do. The steel industry is closely related to all production departments. From the inside, it is a unified whole consisting of many departments including mining, ore dressing, refractories, coking, and steel rolling, with iron smelting and steelmaking as the center. From the external relationship, it is closely related to coal production, machinery manufacturing, transportation, power supply, geological exploration, basic construction, and even chemical industry and light industry. They are interlocked and mutually promoting. If one link cannot keep up, it will affect the overall situation. At present, in order to ensure the rapid rise in steel production, it is not only required that all departments within the steel industry cooperate closely and keep up closely, but also that other industrial departments actively serve steel production increase. All departments must establish the idea of serving steel and make contributions to completing this year's steel production increase task.

Vigorously increasing production and economizing coal and ore, and strengthening transportation work, are the central links to ensuring the completion of this year's steel production increase task. Coal and ore are the main "food" for steel production and the most important material foundation for the development of the steel industry. The rapid increase in coal and ore production is of decisive significance for completing the steel production increase task. Since 1958, although coal production in Anhui Province has increased several times, it still cannot meet the needs of the high-speed development of steel production. Most of the existing small and medium-sized mines are newly built, and technical transformation has not been fully completed, and the production level cannot fully meet the needs. These situations show that to ensure steel production increase, we must first focus on increasing coal and ore production. At the same time, we must transport coal and ore to the furnace in a timely manner so that the blast furnace can eat enough and have surplus grain.

How can we ensure the increase in coal and ore production and strengthen transportation work? In terms of coal, we must increase the number of coal mining working faces in existing mines, accelerate the construction of new mine railway special lines and power station projects to expand production capacity; accelerate the recovery progress of coal mining working faces to increase output per unit area; increase the recovery rate and extract as much coal as possible that can be mined; consolidate and improve the existing advanced coal mining methods, and continue to experiment with new coal mining methods to improve production efficiency. In terms of mines, we must firmly grasp technical transformation, especially to ensure that a number of key transformed small mines are completed as soon as possible, so that the production capacity reaches the design requirements; firmly grasp stripping work to ensure that each mine always has three to five months of recoverable ore; firmly grasp the promotion of small-scale mechanization, vigorously carry out tool reforms, and rapidly improve mining efficiency; firmly grasp mine transportation, vigorously build inclined automatic winching equipment, and build landslide-style ore storage warehouses, platform hoppers and other ore storage and loading equipment to ensure more ore is transported out; firmly grasp the crushing and washing of ore to improve ore grade and ensure that blast furnaces eat enough and eat well. In terms of transportation, we must speed up the construction of railways, bridges, stations, docks and other projects for transporting coal and ore, strengthen road maintenance, do a good job in vehicle and ship maintenance, strengthen transportation organization, improve loading and unloading methods, and do a good job in safe transportation to improve transportation efficiency and ensure that coal, ore and transferred pig iron are transported out in a timely manner.

To ensure the completion of this year's steel production increase task, we must both open up new sources and reduce expenditure. If we only pay attention to increasing production and do not pay attention to economy, the things increased in production will be wasted in vain. As a result, not only will the goal of increasing production not be achieved, but also the contradiction between fuel and raw material supply and demand will be expanded, affecting the completion of the steel production increase task. In practicing economy, we must first vigorously economize on coal consumption. At present, there are still many waste phenomena in coal use, and it is necessary to widely carry out education on economizing coal consumption, so that each production and living unit can understand the important significance of economizing coal consumption for ensuring the completion of this year's steel production increase task, and cherish coal as food, and do not waste even an ounce. In practicing economy, all walks of life should pay special attention to further economizing on labor, rationally adjusting the production layout, improving labor organization, implementing fixed quotas, and greatly streamlining non-production personnel, so that every worker can stand in the positions urgently needed for production and play a greater role in completing the steel production increase task.

While increasing production and economizing coal and ore, we must vigorously improve product quality. Improving product quality relatively reduces fuel and raw material consumption, increases output, and improves production efficiency. Conversely, if the quality is low, fuel and raw material consumption will be high, and there will be more waste and substandard products, and production efficiency will be reduced. If the ash content of coke is high and the sulfur content is high, the output of iron will be reduced, and coke consumption will also increase, and the quality of pig iron smelted will not be high. Low-quality pig iron, used for steelmaking, will increase iron consumption, reduce the pass rate of steel, and reduce steel output; used for casting, it will increase waste and affect product quality. Therefore, all departments must attach importance to and improve product quality. Coal departments must find ways to reduce the gangue content of coal, coal washing and coking departments must reduce the ash and sulfur content of coke, ore mining departments must improve the grade of ore, and steel production departments must also strengthen raw material management, improve operating technology, and smelt more and better steel.

Deeply mobilizing the masses and carrying out mass movements in a big way is the fundamental way to overfulfill this year's steel production task. The masses are the creators of all material wealth, and to achieve victory in the increase production and practice economy movement, we must deeply mobilize the masses and carry out mass movements in a big way. After the Party Central Committee issued the call for the whole Party and the whole people to increase grain and steel, all factories and mines in the province have taken action and set off a new upsurge of increase production and practice economy on an unprecedented scale. However, the depth and breadth of mobilizing the masses are not balanced among various enterprises. In the province as a whole, there are currently three situations. First, the Party committee attaches importance to it, the secretary takes action, grasps it early, grasps it tightly, and acts quickly. In these units, the momentum of the movement is great, the organizational work is done well, both vigorously and practically, the increase production indicators are implemented, the measures are concrete, the red flag competition and technical innovation are in full swing, and production is greatly increasing. Second, the mobilization of the masses in some units is not sufficient, the grasp is not tight, and the action is not fast. In these units, there is a lack of specific and meticulous organizational work, the increase production indicators have not been fully implemented, the measures are not concrete enough, the competition movement has not been well carried out, and although there is some improvement in production, the progress is not fast. Third, individual units have not seriously grasped it, leading cadres have not personally taken command, and the Central Committee's instructions on the increase production and practice economy movement have only been generally conveyed to the workers, and the workers have not been organized to conduct serious study and discussion; the movement has not yet formed, the leadership is lagging behind the masses, and production is in a passive state. The main reasons why the masses in these units have not been fully mobilized are: first, some leading cadres lack a strong mass viewpoint, and second, there is a lack of meticulous organizational work. In order to better promote the mass movement of increase production and practice economy and ensure the completion of the steel production increase task, leading cadres at all levels must first firmly establish the viewpoint of relying on the masses, fully trust the strength and wisdom of the masses, conscientiously mobilize the masses, and do a good job in production. When mobilizing the masses, we must repeatedly explain to them the current situation and tasks, and hand over the increase production and practice economy plan to the masses for discussion. After the masses are mobilized, they should be organized to conduct a major inspection of increase production and practice economy, conduct a big airing of views, put up big-character posters, expose the problems existing in production, and through the method of combining top-down exposure with bottom-up inspection, combining self-inspection with mutual inspection, and combining line-by-line inspection with block-by-block inspection, inspect the implementation of the production plan in the first three quarters, and check whether the plan for the fourth quarter has been implemented and whether the measures are concrete; further mobilize the masses to formulate specific indicators and specific measures for each month, each ten days, each day, and each shift; and implement the plans and measures to each workshop, work section, team, and even individual. Problems found in the inspection should be solved in a timely manner, and advanced experiences found should be summarized and promoted in a timely manner.

In order to mobilize the masses more effectively and further stimulate the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses, each region and each enterprise must make full use of various effective competition forms, such as opponent competitions, counterpart competitions, performance competitions, weekend martial arts meetings, treasure competitions, production sports meetings, technical innovation conferences, etc., to set off a production competition upsurge among enterprises, workshops, and teams. In the competition, we must compete not only in output, quality, cost, and safety, but also in self-reliance and mutual cooperation. Each unit should conduct regular inspections and evaluations, commend the advanced, promote the backward, and promptly promote advanced experience, so that the advanced production level can be quickly transformed into the production level of the whole society. In the competition, it is especially important to continue to greatly promote the communist style, the previous shift should create conditions for the next shift, and earnestly achieve the goal of giving convenience to others and leaving difficulties to oneself, helping each other, learning from each other, improving together, and leaping forward together. In the competition, technical innovation should be regarded as an important content. All factories and mines must adopt the method of combining leading cadres, technical personnel and workers, and conduct a serious sorting out, review and identification of the large number of innovation projects created successfully in the past, so as to systematize them; and rapidly promote those innovation projects that have a direct role in solving the key problems in current production, have the greatest effect, and have general significance. In short, in the vigorous mass movement, we must practically do detailed and concrete organizational work, so that the increase production and practice economy movement can develop more deeply and more healthily.

Whether the steel production task can be overfulfilled, the decisive key lies in the rapid improvement of the cadre style and the serious effort to go deep into the production front line. Since the beginning of this year, a large number of cadres on the industrial front of the province have been transferred to the production front line, which has played a great role in promoting production. However, some cadres have not yet solved the problems of what is meant by going deep into the production front line, what to do when going deep, and how to do it. Some people think that going from the agency to the factory and mine, and from the department to the workshop, is going deep into the production front line. This is obviously very insufficient. Real going deep is to drill into production. That is to say, each leading cadre must conscientiously go deep into the open pit and adit in the mine, go deep to the side of the blast furnace and converter, go deep into the mine of the coal mine, and go deep to the port, station, loading and unloading point and transfer station. In short, we must go deep into every work section and team, put our feet down, stretch our hands in, and use our hearts to familiarize ourselves with and deeply understand the various problems in production. This is the real going deep into the front line. Some people think that participating in production labor with the masses is going deep into the front line. This view is also not entirely correct. It must be recognized that cadres participating in production cannot only play the role of an ordinary worker, but more importantly, find key points, find tricks, and grasp measures with the masses in participating in production, and help grassroots cadres lead production well. All cadres must make it clear that going deep is to practically discover and solve problems, and going deep is to make output rise rapidly and give full play to the role of promoters. This is the purpose of our going deep into the production front line. To achieve this goal, we must grasp the problems deeply and thoroughly. Only by grasping them deeply can we find out the problems on the edge of the knife, prescribe the right medicine, and achieve twice the result with half the effort. We must grasp it practically, and cannot just hand over tasks without handing over methods, and only make arrangements without making inspections. We must grasp it tightly and firmly, act vigorously and resolutely, do it as soon as we say it, and grasp it to the end; prevent just talking without grasping, dragging on, or grasping without tightening, grasping without fierceness, grasping the beginning without grasping the end, grasping a little and releasing a little, and having no beginning and no end. Chairman Mao taught us: "Only by grasping something very tightly and never letting go can we grasp it. Grasping without tightening is equal to not grasping." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume IV, p. 1443) Cadres who go deep into the production front line must grasp ideology, production, and life in an all-round way; grasping ideology and grasping life are also for the purpose of grasping production. In grasping ideology, we must understand what the workers are thinking at any time, grasp the ideological trends, be the confidants and close friends of the masses, and help them solve ideological problems and practical difficulties in a timely manner, and constantly improve their political consciousness. In grasping life, we must pay attention to the combination of work and rest, and earnestly ensure that workers have eight hours of rest every day; we must do a good job in the canteen, give full play to the spirit of self-reliance, grow vegetables in a big way, and vigorously do a good job in the production of various non-staple foods to ensure that workers have work and rest, and eat their fill and eat well. When carrying out these tasks, we must adopt the method of combining leadership and the masses, leading cadres and the masses eat, live, work, and discuss together, share weal and woe with the masses, and rely closely on the masses. Workshop directors and branch secretaries should care for soldiers like company commanders and instructors in the People's Army, and care for them meticulously. If leading cadres can do this, then the masses can play an infinite amount of power in the battle. The broad masses of cadres must have the determination, work hard, strive to be strong, and truly be in the front line, be in the front line, be red in the front line, and be expert in the front line, and lead the broad masses to actively do a good job in production. In this way, we will certainly be able to victoriously complete the glorious task of increasing steel production this year.

    增产钢铁的几个关键问题
    中共安徽省委书记处书记　李任之
    今年以来，安徽省整个工业战线的形势很好。工业生产、交通运输和基本建设等方面继续保持着高速度的发展，取得了新的巨大的成就；规模壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动，内容丰富，成绩显著，并正在更深入地向前发展；各种“小洋群”和“小土群”企业又有许多新的发展和提高；广大职工群众精神振奋，意气风发，斗志昂扬。这一切情况表明，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的照耀下，在过去两年国民经济全面跃进的基础上，安徽省工业战线和其他各个战线一样，始终保持着持续跃进的大好局面。
    在“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针指导下，今年安徽省钢铁工业一跃再跃。一个特点是，增长的幅度大。今年1至9月份，钢、铁、煤的产量与去年同期相比，钢增长了一点四倍，铁增长了59.5％，钢材增长了十三点九倍，煤增长了22％。运输量也相应地增长了53.2％。外调生铁增长14.8％。这些数字生动地表明，安徽省钢铁工业和其他各项工业生产既是大跃进的高速度，又是有计划、按比例地发展。另一个特点是，各种技术经济指标有了进一步提高。不仅钢铁产量有大幅度增长，而且产品质量进一步提高，品种进一步增多，利用系数进一步提高，成本进一步降低；基本上达到了多快好省的要求。再一个特点是，技术改革更全面、更系统。钢铁“小洋群”的技术改造，由零星的单项改革，发展到整个生产过程的改革，大大地提高了“四化”程度。如炼铁“小洋群”，普遍地对运输、破碎系统、上料系统、供风系统、煤气系统进行了全面的改造。由于大搞技术改造，大大提高了机械化和半机械化程度，提高了工效，节约了劳力，很多企业不但做到了增产不增人，而且还做到了增产又减人。
    继续高速度发展中的安徽省钢铁工业，今年以来业已取得了巨大成绩。但是，我们丝毫也不能自满。今年前三个季度钢铁生产的成绩固然很大，但第四季度的生产任务比前更为繁重。同时要看到，在我们的工作中，还存在一些缺点和困难：生产中的一些薄弱环节尚待进一步加强；企业管理水平还不能适应生产发展的需要。摆在我们面前的任务，就是要乘着大好形势，再接再厉，动员一切可以动员的力量，利用一切可以利用的因素，深入开展以钢铁为中心的增产节约运动，促进钢铁生产持续地大幅度地增长，力争提前完成今年的钢铁增产任务。
    今年钢铁增产的任务是艰巨的，也是光荣的。我们一定要完成这个任务，也一定能完成这个任务。当前，完成钢铁生产任务的有利条件很多。第一，全党有决心。自党中央号召开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动后，全省各级党的领导同志都有决心，普遍认真地加强了钢铁生产的领导；绝大部分干部深入到了生产第一线，充实和加强了基层的领导力量。第二，新的增产节约高潮已经形成。广大群众热烈响应党中央的号召，正在千方百计地为今年钢铁增产而日夜奋战，生产水平正在逐步提高。第三，原材料的生产水平和运输能力更加提高。各煤矿经过采取一系列措施后，生产水平日益显著地上升；各矿山经过一系列的技术改造，矿石产量大大增加；煤炭和矿石的运出量大大增长。第四，一批新建工程陆续投入生产，生产能力进一步增强。只要我们很好运用这些条件，充分发挥主观能动作用，踏踏实实，埋头苦干，超额完成今年钢铁生产任务是完全可能的。
    应当怎样来超额完成今年的钢铁生产任务呢？加强政治思想工作，不断提高广大职工的政治觉悟，是超额完成今年钢铁生产任务的首要保证。全省厂矿企业的广大职工，对于当前政治经济的大好形势，对于开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的重大意义，绝大多数人的认识是明确的。他们以高涨的革命热情，积极地投入了这一运动，决心苦干实干巧干，坚决超额完成今年的钢铁生产任务。这是当前广大职工群众的思想主流。但是目前也有少数职工，对于当前增产节约运动的重大意义还认识不足，应当进一步加强思想教育。
    有人认为：“增产计划一定要完成，但节约计划完成不完成关系不大。”他们只重视生产，忽视节约。这种把增产和节约对立起来的看法是不正确的。当然，重视生产是完全对的，但是忽视节约则是不对的。增产节约是多快好省地建设社会主义的基本方针，是一个问题的两个方面，只有既增产又节约，才能实现多快好省的要求。只抓生产，不抓节约，对生产的成果任意浪费，这就失去了增产的作用，也就不能达到多快好省的目的。反之，如果节约工作搞得好，减少了原材料和人力的浪费，就能以同样的物力、人力生产出更多的东西，实现更大的增产，促进生产的更快发展。目前钢铁增产的关键问题之一，就是要保证原材料的供应，而要解决这个问题，一方面需要大力增产，另一方面必须依靠节约。全省炼铁的焦比，如能降低6％，今年内就能多炼出生铁七万多吨；炼钢铁耗量如能降低10％，今年内就能多炼钢近两万吨。由此可见，要全面地切实地实现总路线，就必须在大抓生产的同时，大抓节约。
    有的单位因前一个时期生产任务完成得不够好，目前感到时间短、任务重，便产生一些畏难情绪；另有的单位因前一个时期生产任务完成得较好，还有增产潜力，但不想尽量地多增产。这两种思想，与鼓足干劲、力争上游的精神都是不相符的。应当认识：在工作中，困难总是有的，所谓困难，就是客观事物发展中的矛盾，没有矛盾，事物就不能发展。关键不在于有没有困难，而在于如何鼓足干劲来克服困难。在安徽省钢铁生产中，有的企业条件虽差，但生产却超过了条件好的企业。就是同一个企业，设备、人员没有变化，但在鼓足干劲与没有鼓足干劲的情况下，却出现了两种截然不同的生产局面。鼓足干劲时生产立即上升，畏难松劲时产量立即下降。这就有力地说明，人们的精神状态如何，对于生产的发展起着决定性的作用。何况，我们现有的生产条件无论是设备能力，原材料供应，技术力量，或领导经验等等，与过去比较起来都要好得多了，实现增产任务是完全可能的。因此，任何畏难情绪是没有根据的，必须迅速加以克服。至于有的单位生产情况很好，潜力也较大，但却不打算尽量地增产，这实际上是保守思想的表现。每个革命者要本着不断革命的要求，力争上游，有条件多增产的，一定要力争多增产。同时要认识，在生产过程中，各个企业发展是不平衡的，有些单位计划完成得较好，有的单位由于各种原因不能按时完成计划，这就要求那些生产条件好的企业尽量地多增产，这样才能保证增产计划的全面实现。
    也有人认为：“大办粮食是农村人民公社的事，大办钢铁是钢铁厂的事，我既不搞农业，又不搞钢铁，大办粮、钢与己无关。”这种想法显然是错误的。党中央和毛主席一再教导我们：农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础，钢是工业的“粮食”，也是农业机械化和农业基本建设的物质基础。有了更多的粮食和钢铁，什么事情都好办了。粮、钢发展的快慢，直接关系到整个国民经济的发展速度。安徽省各项建设事业所以能够获得高速度的发展，正是由于贯彻了以粮为纲、以钢为纲的结果。粮食和钢铁的发展，对每个部门的关系如此密切，如此重大，岂能说“与己无关”。整个国民经济是一个有机整体，整个工业生产也是一个有机整体。在开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，所有工业部门的职工都是有事可做的。钢铁工业与所有的生产部门都有着密切联系。从内部来说，它是一个以炼铁、炼钢为中心的包括采矿、选矿、耐火、炼焦、轧钢等许多部门组成的统一体。从外部关系来说，它与煤炭生产、机械制造、交通运输、电力供应、地质勘探、基本建设以至化工、轻工等部门有着密切的联系，它们之间是环环相扣，互相促进的，如果一环跟不上，就要影响全局。目前，为了保证钢铁产量的迅速上升，不仅要求钢铁工业内部各部门密切配合，紧紧跟上，并且要求其他工业部门积极地为钢铁增产服务。各个部门必须树立为钢铁服务的思想，为完成今年的钢铁增产任务作出贡献。
    大力增产和节约煤炭、矿石，加强交通运输工作，是保证完成今年钢铁增产任务的中心环节。煤炭和矿石是钢铁生产的主要“粮食”，是钢铁工业赖以发展的最重要的物质基础。煤炭和矿石的迅速增产，对于完成钢铁增产任务具有决定性的意义。安徽省从1958年以来，煤炭生产虽然有了成倍的增长，但仍然不能满足钢铁生产高速度发展的需要。现有的中小型矿山，大部分是新建起来的，技术改造还没有全部完成，生产水平也还不能完全适应需要。这些情况说明，要保证钢铁增产，必先抓好煤炭和矿石的增产。同时，还要把煤炭和矿石及时地运到炉边，才能使高炉吃得饱，有余粮。
    怎样才能保证煤炭、矿石增产和加强交通运输工作呢？在煤炭方面，必须增加现有矿井的采煤工作面，加快新井铁路专用线和电站工程的建设，以扩大生产能力；加快采煤工作面的回采进度，以提高单位面积产量；提高回采率，把可以采出的煤炭尽可能全部开采出来；巩固提高现有的先进采煤方法，并继续试验新的采煤方法，以提高生产效率。在矿山方面，必须抓紧技术改造，特别是要确保一批重点改造的小型矿山尽速改造完毕，使生产能力达到设计要求；抓紧剥离工作，保证每个矿山经常有三至五个月的回采矿量；抓紧推广小型机械化，大搞工具改革，迅速提高采矿工效；抓紧矿山运输，大搞斜坡自动卷扬设备，大建滑坡式储矿仓、平台漏斗等储矿和装车设备，保证多运出矿石；抓紧矿石的破碎和洗选，提高矿石品位，保证高炉吃饱吃好。在交通运输方面，必须加快运煤、运矿的铁路、桥梁、车站、码头等工程的建设，加强道路养护，做好车船维修，加强运输组织，改进装卸方法，搞好安全运输，以提高运输效率，保证把煤炭、矿石和外调生铁及时运出。
    要保证完成今年的钢铁增产任务，一面要开源，一面要节流。如果只注意增产，不注意节约，增产的东西被白白地浪费掉，结果不仅达不到增产的目的，而且会扩大燃料、原料供需之间的矛盾，影响到钢铁增产任务的完成。在厉行节约中，首先要大力节约用煤。目前在煤炭使用上还存在着不少浪费现象，必须广泛开展节约用煤的教育，使每个生产、生活单位都能了解到节约用煤对于保证完成今年钢铁增产任务的重要意义，做到惜煤如粮，斤两不浪费。在厉行节约方面，各行各业特别要注意进一步节约劳动力，合理调整生产布局，改进劳动组合，实行定员定额，大量精简非生产人员，使每一个职工都能站到生产迫切需要的岗位上，为完成钢铁增产任务发挥出更大的作用。
    在增产和节约煤炭、矿石的同时，必须大力提高产品质量。产品质量提高了，就相对地降低了燃料、原料消耗，增加了产量，提高了生产效率。反之，质量低了，燃料、原料的消耗就高，生产出来的废品、次品也多，生产效率就要降低。焦炭灰分多，含硫量高，铁的产量就要降低，焦炭消耗也要增加，而且炼出的生铁质量也不高。质量低的生铁，用于炼钢，就会增加铁的消耗，降低钢的合格率，减少钢的产量；用于铸造，就会增加废品，并影响产品质量。因此，各个部门都要重视和提高产品质量，煤炭部门要设法降低煤炭的含矸率，洗煤和炼焦部门要降低焦炭的灰分和硫分，矿石开采部门要提高矿石的品位，钢铁生产部门也要加强原料管理，改进操作技术，炼出更多更好的钢铁。
    深入发动群众，大搞群众运动，是超额完成今年钢铁生产任务的根本办法。群众是一切物质财富的创造者，要取得增产节约运动的胜利，必须深入发动群众，大搞群众运动。党中央发出全党全民动手增产粮、钢的号召以后，全省各厂矿企业已经行动起来，掀起了一个规模空前的增产节约的新高潮。但是，各个企业之间发动群众的深度和广度还不够平衡。就全省来说，目前有三种情况。一是党委重视，书记动手，抓得早，抓得紧，行动快。在这类单位中，运动的声势大，组织工作搞得好，既轰轰烈烈，又踏踏实实，增产指标落实，措施具体，红旗竞赛和技术革新搞得热火朝天，生产大幅度地增长。二是有的单位群众发动得不够充分，抓得不紧，行动不快。在这类单位中，缺乏具体细致的组织工作，增产指标尚未完全落实，措施也不够具体，竞赛运动尚未很好地开展起来，生产虽有些起色，但是进展不快。三是个别单位还没有认真地抓，领导干部还没有亲自挂帅，对中央的增产节约运动指示只向职工群众作了一般传达，没有组织职工进行认真学习讨论；运动尚未形成，领导落后于群众，生产处于被动状态。这些单位的群众所以没有充分地发动起来，其主要原因：一是有些领导干部缺乏坚强的群众观点，二是缺乏细致的组织工作。为了把增产节约的群众运动更好地向前推进，保证钢铁增产任务的完成，各级领导干部首先要牢固地树立依靠群众的观点，充分信任群众的力量和智慧，认真发动群众，搞好生产。在发动群众时，必须反复地向他们讲清当前的形势、任务，并把增产节约计划交给群众讨论。群众发动起来后，就要组织他们进行增产节约的大检查，大鸣大放，贴大字报，揭发生产中存在的问题，并通过自下而上的揭发和自上而下的检查相结合、自查与互查相结合、条条检查与块块检查相结合的方法，检查前三个季度生产计划的执行情况，检查第四季度计划是否落实，措施是否具体；进一步发动群众订出每月、每旬、每天、每班的具体指标和具体措施；把计划和措施落实到每个车间、工段、小组以至个人。检查中发现的问题，要及时解决，发现的先进经验，要及时总结推广。
    为了更有成效地发动群众，进一步激发广大群众的劳动热情，各个地区、各个企业必须充分运用各种有效的竞赛形式，如对手赛，对口赛，表演赛，周末比武会，赛宝会，生产运动会，技术革新大会演等等，掀起企业与企业、车间与车间、小组与小组的生产竞赛热潮。在竞赛中，既要赛产量、赛质量、赛成本、赛安全，又要赛自力更生，赛相互协作。各个单位要经常进行检查评比，表扬先进，推动后进，及时推广先进经验，使先进的生产水平迅速变成全社会的生产水平。在竞赛中，特别要继续大大发扬共产主义风格，上一班要为下一班创造条件，切实做到把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己，互相帮助，互相学习，共同提高，共同跃进。在竞赛中，要把技术革新作为一个重要内容。各厂矿企业必须采取领导干部、技术人员和工人三结合的方法，对过去创造成功的大量革新项目，认真地进行一次整理、审查和鉴定工作，使之系统化；把那些对于解决当前生产关键问题有直接作用、收效最大、带有普遍意义的革新项目，迅速加以推广。总之，在轰轰烈烈的群众运动中，必须踏实地做好细致、具体的组织工作，才能使增产节约运动更深入、更健康地向前发展。
    钢铁生产任务能不能超额完成，决定的关键还在于干部作风的迅速改进，认真做到深入生产第一线。今年以来，全省工业战线上已有大批干部下放到生产第一线，对促进生产起了很大作用。但是，有些干部对于什么叫深入生产第一线？深入下去做什么？怎么做？这些问题还没有很好解决。有的人认为，从机关跑到厂矿，从科室跑到车间，就算是深入了生产第一线。这显然是很不够的。真正的深入，是要钻到生产中去。也就是说，每个领导干部要认真深入到矿山的塘口、坑口里去，深入到高炉、转炉旁边去，深入到煤矿的矿井里去，深入到港、站、装卸点和中转站去。总之，要深入到每一个工段和小组中去，脚定下来，手伸进去，用心去摸熟摸深摸透生产中的各种问题。这才算是真正地深入了第一线。有的人认为，与群众一起进行生产劳动，就是深入了第一线。这种看法也是不完全的。必须认识，干部参加生产，不能只起一个普通工人的作用，更重要的是在参加生产中同群众一道，找关键，找窍门，抓措施，帮助基层干部把生产领导好。所有的干部一定要明确，深入下去是为了踏踏实实地发现问题、解决问题，深入下去是为了使产量迅速上升，充分发挥促进派的作用，这就是我们深入生产第一线的目的。要达到这个目的，对问题一定要抓得深透，抓深透了才能摸清刀口上的问题，对症下药，事半功倍。要抓得踏实，不能只交任务，不交办法，只作布置，不作检查。要紧抓狠抓，雷厉风行，说干就干，一抓到底；防止只说不抓，拖拖拉拉，或者抓而不紧，抓而不狠，抓头不抓尾，抓一点放一点，有始无终。毛主席教导我们：“什么东西只有抓得很紧，毫不放松，才能抓住。抓而不紧，等于不抓。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷，第1443页）干部深入到生产第一线，必须把思想、生产、生活全面地抓好；抓好思想，抓好生活，也都是为了抓好生产。在抓思想方面，要随时了解工人在想什么，掌握思想动向，做群众的知心人、贴心人，及时地帮助他们解决思想问题和实际困难，不断地提高他们的政治觉悟。在抓生活方面，要注意劳逸结合，切实做到工人每日有八小时休息；要搞好食堂，充分发扬自力更生精神，大种蔬菜，大力搞好各种副食品生产，保证工人有劳有逸，吃饱吃好。进行这些工作的时候，都要采取领导和群众相结合的方法，领导干部和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，与群众同甘共苦，紧紧依靠群众。车间主任、支部书记要像人民军队中的连长、指导员那样地关心战士，无微不至地体贴战士。领导干部如果能够这样做了，那末群众就能够在战斗中发挥无穷无尽的力量。广大干部要抱定决心，艰苦奋斗，发愤图强，切切实实地做到身在第一线，心在第一线，红在第一线，专在第一线，领导广大群众积极搞好生产。这样，我们就一定能够胜利地完成今年钢铁增产的光荣任务。
