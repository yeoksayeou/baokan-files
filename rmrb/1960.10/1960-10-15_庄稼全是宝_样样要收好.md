The Fengqiao Production Team Comprehensively Arranges Labor, Requiring: Equal Treatment of Staple and Miscellaneous Grains, Timely and Careful Harvesting; No Discarding of Any Leaf of Economic Crops; No Rotting of Any Part of a By-product

According to the *Guizhou Daily* news, the Fengqiao Production Team of Panshui Commune in Puan County, Guizhou Province, under the specific assistance of Gao Qifang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Puan County Party Committee, thoroughly implemented policies, mobilized the masses, and formulated harvesting and distribution methods for various crops based on the Party's distribution policies. This has been well-received by the masses and has basically achieved the goal of harvesting staple grains, miscellaneous grains, economic crops, oil crops, and agricultural by-products as they ripen, and harvesting as much as possible.

The Party branch of this team, with the help of Gao Qifang, after analysis and research, believed that all kinds of crops are ripe and must be brought home completely, without losing sight of one while focusing on another. Therefore, the Party branch used various forms to educate the members on comprehensive harvesting, explaining to the masses the importance of harvesting grain crops, economic crops, staple grains, miscellaneous grains, main products, and by-products. Specific requirements were put forward: grain crops should be harvested carefully and meticulously, with both staple and miscellaneous grains being harvested; economic crops should be harvested in a timely manner, without discarding any leaves; by-products should be used completely, without rotting any part or discarding any leaves. In order to use facts to educate cadres and members, the Party branch specifically conducted a processing experiment on corn by-products, which resulted in the processing of a large amount of starch. Those who originally thought that corn stalks were not worth much also actively supported the harvesting of by-products. Through these efforts, the idea of "every crop is a treasure, and everything must be harvested well" was established among all members. The members said: Everything is useful, and nothing can be discarded.

In order to further stimulate the production enthusiasm of the broad masses, the Party branch, based on the Party's distribution policy, specifically stipulated the harvesting and distribution methods for various crops (especially by-products), and correctly handled the relationship between the production team, the production brigade, and the members. For example, it was stipulated that rice straw and corn stalks would be uniformly managed and used by the production team; and that enough rice straw would be distributed to members according to their needs in life; corn husks and corn cobs would be kept by the brigade, mainly for processing starch, with the production team only taking a portion as feed. For soybean leaves, a method of sharing between the production team and the brigade was adopted: 30% of the soybean leaves harvested by each brigade would belong to the production team, as feed for the team-run livestock farm; 70% would belong to the brigade, as feed for the cafeteria's pig raising. Livestock fodder, according to the prescribed standards, would be uniformly distributed by the production team in the form of rice straw or corn stalks. After mobilizing the masses to discuss in this way, everyone thought it was very reasonable, and the production team, the production brigade, and the members were all taken care of. Therefore, everyone harvested by-products as they harvested main products. Corn stalks were cut down as they were harvested, changing the past phenomenon of burning corn stalks. In the past, the team only harvested corn kernels but not husks, but now it has been changed to harvest all the husks, which not only yielded by-products but also reduced scattering. The members said: "Doing so has so many benefits, we guarantee to harvest all the main and by-products in the fields."

This team also properly arranged labor according to the requirements that all kinds of crops should be harvested well and according to their growth characteristics, adopting the method of strong laborers harvesting corn and rice, with auxiliary laborers harvesting minor grains and some by-products, implementing the method of "two combinations, one specialization" to contract for harvesting various crops. "Two combinations" means combining the harvesting of corn with the harvesting of sunflowers, and combining the cutting of corn stalks with the harvesting of small beans, golden beans, and other minor grains; "one specialization" means that flue-cured tobacco is harvested by a specialized team to ensure quality. For walnuts, chestnuts, etc., a certain amount of time is arranged to organize members to carry out a concentrated rush harvest.

Because this team established the idea of comprehensive and good harvesting among all members, correctly determined the harvesting methods, and comprehensively and reasonably organized and arranged labor, it achieved the goal of harvesting one piece of land as it ripens, and harvesting as much as possible. By the end of September, 80% of the ripe corn had been harvested, more than half of the rice had been harvested, and soybeans and other minor grains had basically been harvested. The harvest of other by-products and economic crops was also done without any omissions. Only bean leaves and corn husks amounted to more than 256,000 jin, and corn stalks were also piled up in piles. At the same time, chestnuts, walnuts, etc. have all been recovered, achieving the goal of harvesting everything that should be harvested. (Attached photo)

### 庄稼全是宝　样样要收好

    庄稼全是宝　样样要收好
    峰桥生产队全面安排劳力，要求做到：主杂粮一视同仁，适时精收细打；经济作物片叶不丢；副产物一株不烂
    据贵州日报消息　贵州普安县盘水公社峰桥生产队，在中共普安县委常委高启方的具体帮助下，深入贯彻政策，发动群众，并根据党的分配政策规定了各种作物的收割、分配办法，深受群众欢迎，基本做到了主粮、杂粮、经济作物、油料作物和农副产物随熟随收，有多少收多少。
    这个队的党支部在高启方的帮助下，经过分析研究，认为：各种作物都成熟了，要全部收进家来，不能顾此失彼，抓一头丢一头。因此，党支部利用各种形式对社员进行了全面收好的教育，向群众讲清粮食作物、经济作物、主粮、杂粮、主产品、副产物都要收好的道理。并提出了具体要求：粮食作物要精收细打，主、杂同收；经济作物要及时收割，片叶不丢；副产物要一株不烂，一叶不丢。为了用事实来教育干部和社员，党支部专门进行了包谷副产物的加工试验，结果加工出大批的淀粉。原来认为包谷秆“油水不大”的人也都积极拥护收好副产物了。通过这些工作，在全体社员中树立了“庄稼全是宝，样样都收好”的思想。社员们说：样样有用，一样也不能丢。
    党支部为了进一步发挥广大群众的生产积极性，根据党的分配政策，具体规定了各种作物（特别是副产物）的收割办法和分配办法，正确处理了生产队、生产小队和社员之间的关系。如规定：稻草、包谷秆由生产队统一保管，统一使用；并根据社员生活上的需要，按人发给足够的谷草；包谷壳和包谷心归小队保管，主要供加工淀粉用，生产队只提成一部分作为饲料。对黄豆叶，采取由生产队和小队分成的办法：各小队收的黄豆叶，30％归生产队，作为队办畜牧场的饲料；70％归小队，作为食堂养猪的饲料。牲畜草料，根据规定的标准，由生产队统一发稻草或包谷秆。这样发动群众讨论之后，大家都认为很合理，生产队、生产小队、社员都照顾到了。因此，大家都像收割主产品一样来收割副产物，包谷秆做到了随收随砍，改变了过去把包谷秆一火烧掉的现象。队里过去收包谷不收壳，现在改为全部收毛壳，不仅得到了副产物，而且减少了抛撒。社员们说：“这样做有这么大的好处，我们保证把地头的主、副产品全部收光。”
    这个队还根据各种作物都要收好的要求和生长的特点，妥善安排了劳力，采取强壮劳力收割包谷、水稻，附带劳力收小杂粮和一些副产物，实行“二结合、一专”的办法包收各种作物。“二结合”即收包谷结合收葵花，砍包谷秆结合收小豆、金豆等小杂粮；“一专”就是烤烟由专业队收，以保证质量。对核桃、板栗等，安排一定的时间，组织社员进行突击抢收。
    这个队由于在全体社员中树立了收全收好的思想，正确地确定了收割办法，全面合理地组织安排劳力，因此做到了黄一块收一块，熟一丘收一丘，有多少收多少。到9月下旬，成熟的包谷已收了80％，水稻收了一半多，大豆和其他小杂粮已基本收完，其他副产物和经济作物的收获亦做到一点不漏。仅豆叶和包谷壳，就收得二十五万六千多斤，包谷秆也已一堆一堆的堆放起来。同时，板栗、核桃等已全部收回，做到了应该收的都全部收了起来。（附图片）
