Xinhua News Agency, October 16th dispatch from Los Angeles: U.S. Vice President Nixon on the 14th advocated that the United States should mobilize all its forces to carry out the "Cold War" and prepare for a "Hot War."

During his campaign activities for the next presidential election in Los Angeles, he clamored in a speech that now is the time for the United States to "make new efforts and launch a full-scale offensive." He put forward a plan advocating "mobilizing" the strength of all aspects of the United States to engage in the struggle against the hostile socialist camp. He announced that if he is elected president, "in military terms," he will immediately convene a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and senior military commanders at home and abroad to "re-examine" the rapid development of Soviet policies and technologies, and will "re-estimate" American strategy based on these factors. In "non-military terms," if he is elected president, he will convene a meeting of American "representatives from all walks of life" in the first week of December to discuss how the U.S. government should take action to mobilize the "full resources" of the "free world." In "diplomatic terms," he advocated holding four "regional conferences" (conferences for Western Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia) with the participation of heads of government starting next spring. The purpose of these conferences is to study the issues of so-called "strengthening the United Nations" and "strengthening the free world in political, economic, social, and military aspects." In addition, he advocated exploring the possibility of expanding this group's meeting in the spring of next year into a top-level meeting of heads of government of NATO countries at the NATO Council meeting in December of this year.

Nixon also announced that Eisenhower has agreed to serve as his "advisor" if he is elected president.

In order to defend his plan to step up war preparations, Nixon once again unscrupulously slandered socialist countries. He particularly wantonly defamed the heads of government of socialist countries, saying that the "Communist leaders" took "rude and threatening actions" at the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, and even compared them to "Hitler and Mussolini." He vigorously advocated taking a tough attitude towards socialist countries.

Nixon admitted that the United States will "encounter difficulties" in pursuing its policies. He attempted to refute Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy's statement that America's "prestige" has "declined unprecedentedly," but he himself said helplessly, "I certainly would not say that America's prestige has not encountered difficulties in some parts of the world."

    鼓吹加剧“冷战”准备“热战”
    尼克松要美国“发动全面攻势”
    新华社16日讯　洛杉矶消息：美国副总统尼克松14日鼓吹美国要动员全部力量来进行“冷战”和准备“热战”。
    他在洛杉矶进行竞选下届总统的活动时，在一篇演说中叫嚷，现在已经是美国“进行新的努力和发动全面攻势的时候了”。他提出了一个计划，主张“动员”美国各个方面的力量来从事敌对社会主义阵营的斗争。他宣布，如果他当选总统，“在军事方面”，他将立即召开参谋长联席会议、国防部长、三军部长和国内外高级军事司令官的会议来“重新审查”苏联的政策和技术的迅速发展，并将根据这些因素来“重新估计”美国的战略。在“非军事方面”，如果他当选总统，他将在12月份的第一周召集美国“各界代表”来讨论美国政府如何采取行动来动员“自由世界”的“全部资源”的问题。在“外交方面”，他主张自明年春天起举行四次有政府首脑参加的“区域性会议”（西欧、拉丁美洲、非洲和亚洲会议），这些会议的目的是要研究所谓“加强联合国”和“在政治、经济、社会和军事方面加强自由世界”的问题。此外，他还主张在北大西洋公约集团理事会今年12月的会议上探讨把这个集团明年春季的会议扩大成为北大西洋公约组织国家各国政府首脑最高级会议的可能性。
    尼克松还宣布，艾森豪威尔已经同意担任他的“顾问”，如果他当选总统的话。
    为了替他这个加紧备战的计划辩护，尼克松又大肆诬蔑社会主义国家，他特别放肆地诽谤社会主义国家的政府首脑，说什么“共产党领袖”在联合国大会第十五届会议上采取“粗暴和富于威胁性的行动”，并竟然把他们比拟作“希特勒和墨索里尼”。他大力鼓吹要对社会主义国家采取强硬态度。
    尼克松承认，美国在推行它的政策时是将要“遇到困难的”。他企图反驳民主党总统候选人肯尼迪承认美国的“威信”已“空前低落”的说法，但是他自己也无可奈何地说，“我肯定不会说，美国的威信并没有在世界的某些地方遇到困难”。
