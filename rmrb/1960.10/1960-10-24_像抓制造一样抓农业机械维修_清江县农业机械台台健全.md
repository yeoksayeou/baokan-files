Like Grasping Manufacturing, Grasp Agricultural Machinery Repair
Qingjiang County's Agricultural Machinery is All in Good Order

(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 23rd) Qingjiang County, Jiangxi Province, is resolutely grasping the repair work of agricultural machinery to ensure that every piece of agricultural machinery can give full play to its role. More than 30,000 sets of water pumps, tractors, and a large number of semi-mechanized farm tools that should be repaired in the county have been repaired, all in complete sets with all the necessary parts, and are playing a huge role in the "Three Autumns" production.

This year, Qingjiang County vigorously manufactured and promoted a large number of mechanized and semi-mechanized farm tools, which played a significant role in spring plowing production and summer harvesting and planting. Before the arrival of autumn, the Qingjiang County Party Committee, while continuing to organize relevant units to manufacture and promote more than 17,000 sets of mechanical farm tools, decided, based on the need for maintenance and repair of some agricultural machinery after summer harvesting and planting, to vigorously grasp agricultural machinery repair work, just like grasping the manufacturing and promotion of agricultural machinery. The County Party Committee unified and organized the county, commune, and team-level agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing forces in the county, forming a strong agricultural machinery repair and distribution network, and determined that 60% of the people in the county's agricultural machinery manufacturing factories would engage in repair and distribution, and 40% would rush to manufacture a batch of new machinery. In the repair and distribution work, the three-level machinery repair and distribution forces cooperated and collaborated with each other. The county also extracted more than 1,000 iron, wood, and bamboo workers to form more than 430 mobile repair and distribution teams to go to various production teams to carry out the circulation repair and distribution of new and old farm tools.

Under the guidance of the idea of industrial support for agriculture, the staff of agricultural machinery factories (stations) at all levels actively joined the repair and distribution upsurge. While rushing to repair agricultural machinery, the County Agricultural Machinery Factory also rushed to manufacture ten six-foot lathes for the agricultural machinery factories of various communes, strengthening the commune repair and manufacturing forces. The employees of the Linjiang Commune Agricultural Machinery Factory, in response to the situation that carpenters could not keep up with ironworkers, vigorously promoted the mechanization of woodworking, and in a short period of time, manufactured and promoted innovation tools such as sawing boards, planing materials, drilling holes, and edge trimming, realizing semi-mechanized woodworking production. The carpentry workshop and the iron workshop advanced side by side, and completed the repair and distribution tasks of more than 800 rapid rice harvesters in half a month.

While vigorously grasping repair and distribution work, all localities have generally strengthened education on the care of agricultural machinery and established and improved agricultural machinery management systems. For example, the Jianghuang Management District of Linjiang Commune determined that mechanized farm tools (such as water pumps, etc.) should be regularly maintained by the personnel operating the machinery, and implemented "four fixings": fixing people, fixing machines, fixing maintenance costs, and fixing the service life; semi-mechanized farm tools should be implemented with dedicated personnel, dedicated use, and dedicated management, and be responsible for by cadres, activists, old peasants, and labor models. Therefore, all kinds of farm tools can be maintained, collected, washed, and dried at any time, and the damage rate has been significantly reduced. The County Party Committee has promptly summarized their experience and promoted it throughout the county.

    像抓制造一样抓农业机械维修
    清江县农业机械台台健全
    本报南昌23日电　江西省清江县狠抓农业机械的维修工作，保证每一部农业机械充分发挥作用。全县应修配的三万多部（台）抽水机、拖拉机和大量的半机械化农具，都已修理完毕，台台成套，零件齐备，正在“三秋”生产中发挥着巨大威力。
    清江县今年雷厉风行地制造和推广了大批机械化和半机械化农具，在春耕生产、夏收夏种中发挥了很大作用。秋季到来以前，中共清江县委一面继续组织有关单位制造和推广了一万七千多部（台）机械农具，一面根据部分农业机械经过夏收夏种需要维护修理的情况，决定像抓制造和推广农业机械一样，大抓农业机械维修工作。县委把全县县、社、队的农业机械修制力量统一组织起来，组成了强大的农业机械修配网，并确定全县的农业机械修造工厂以60％的人搞修配，40％的人赶制一批新机械。在修配工作中，三级机械修配力量互相分工协作。全县还抽出了一千多名铁、木、篾工人，组成四百三十多个流动修配小组，到各个生产小队巡回修配新旧农具。
    各级农业机械厂（站）的职工在工业支援农业的思想指导下，积极投入修配热潮。县农业机械厂在赶修农业机械的同时，还为各公社农机厂突击赶制了十台六尺车床，加强了公社修制力量。临江公社农机厂职工针对木工赶不上铁工的情况，大搞木工机械化，在短时间内，制造推广了锯板、刨料、打眼、清边等革新工具，实现了木工半机械化生产。木工车间和铁工车间并肩前进，在半个月内就完成了八百多部快速割禾器的修配任务。
    在大抓修配工作的同时，各地普遍加强了爱护农业机械的教育，建立和健全了农业机械管理制度。如临江公社姜璜管理区确定机械化农具（如抽水机等）由操纵机械的人员负责经常保养，并实行“四定”；定人、定机、定维护费用、定使用年限；半机械化农具实行专人、专用、专管，由干部、积极分子、老农民、劳动模范负责。因此，各种农具都做到了随时养护、收检、洗晒，损坏率显著下降。县委已及时总结了他们的经验，并在全县推广。
