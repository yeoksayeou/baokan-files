Xinhua News Agency, 15th: A new upsurge in the competition to "store grain and gather grass" for the steel industry and seize high coal production has rapidly formed in coal mines across the country, thus promoting the vigorous development of coal production. While coal production is rising steadily, mines have also seen a new situation of comprehensive leap forward in coal transportation, roadway tunneling, mechanical and electrical maintenance, and safe production.

This new upsurge in the competition to seize high coal production in the national coal mine sector has emerged on the basis of extensive discussions among the broad masses of workers and staff on the new situation of the leap forward in industry and agriculture this year and the summary of the achievements of the coal industry production. Therefore, from the beginning, it has the characteristics of being both vigorous and down-to-earth. Coal mining enterprises in various regions have not only formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy and specific guarantee measures at all levels, from the bureau to the mine, from the mine to the mining area, from the mining area to the work team, and from the work team to the individual, but also, on this basis, mines, mining areas, pit entrances, production teams, and work teams have launched a variety of large-scale competitions such as heated rivalries, exhibition matches, tackling key problem contests, collaboration competitions, one-stop races, and model worker selection contests. For example, in order to achieve the conditions proposed by the Hebi Coal Mine workers to coal mines nationwide, all of the mine's more than two thousand work teams were involved in "Thousand-Ton Face Competitions," "Thousand-Meter and Double Thousand-Meter Tunneling Competitions," "Hundred-Day Accident-Free Mechanical and Electrical Competitions," and "Five Major Indicators Competitions" (output, quality, efficiency, safety, cost), and all workers and teams had clear competition opponents and goals. After the launch of the "Set a Starting Point, Rise Step by Step" competition (taking the average advanced quota as the starting point for the competition, and then striving to improve step by step) by more than two thousand mining groups in the Huainan Coal Mine, more than eight hundred and eighty teams broke through the starting point in just six days from September 20th to 25th. In September, the mine overfulfilled the state plan, and the average daily output increased by more than 9% compared with August. Other coal mines, such as Datong, Fengfeng, Pingxiang, Xinwen, and Jingxing, also saw a large increase in production since September due to the widespread launch of large-scale competitions based on work teams. Especially during the high-yield ten-day period dedicated to National Day in late September, the average daily output of these mines increased by more than 10% to 30% compared with the first and middle ten days of the month.

In the competition, the broad masses of workers and staff learned from the advanced and helped the backward, further popularizing the achievements of technical innovation and technical revolution, and making advanced experience more complete. In order to rapidly improve production levels in the competition, the workers and staff of Huainan, Fushun, Fengfeng, Datong and other coal mines launched a wave of learning and promoting advanced experience, not only learning and promoting the advanced experience of their own units, but also learning and promoting the advanced experience created by their competitors. Some bureaus and mines also used methods of rummaging through boxes and cabinets, seeking teachers and visiting sages to gather all kinds of large and small, new and old experiences inside and outside the mine, and cultivated many "multi-treasure combined" coal mining teams, "multi-treasure combined" tunneling teams, "multi-treasure combined" electric shovels, and "multi-treasure combined" electric locomotives. In these competitions, various skilled craftsmen with expertise have been discovered in large numbers. Kailuan Coal Mine organized more than one hundred model workers to "pass on scriptures" and "send treasures" everywhere, circulating and promoting eleven sets of advanced experience in coal mining, support, pillar return, electric chute maintenance, and locomotive safety operation, solving more than two hundred key production problems in half a month. Now, many model workers in this mine have also carried forward the communist style, voluntarily signing up to take root in backward groups, helping backward teams quickly break through key production problems.

Leading cadres at all levels actively responded to the Party's call, going to the front line of production as both production workers and commanders, bringing great encouragement and strong support to the masses of workers and staff who were carrying out the competition. According to statistics from nine coal mines, including Datong, Huainan, Jingxi, Zibo, and Hegang, by the end of September, more than five thousand cadres and technicians from the mine affairs bureau and mine-level leadership organizations had been sent to coal mining areas, teams, and work teams. After arriving at the production site, they went down the well and came up the well at the same time as the workers, effectively exerting the power of eating, living, working, and consulting together, and promptly understanding and solving many production problems. While cadres were being sent down, many mines in Fuxin, Jixi, and other places also launched activities to "bring old generals back to the team." Many veteran technicians who had been detached from production for many years returned to their original posts, using their exemplary actions and skilled technology to lead the masses to increase coal production. In addition, mines generally established and improved the underground office system, the duty system for leading personnel, and the system for leading cadres at all levels to go to coal mining teams, production teams, and tunneling groups to cultivate experimental fields and work shifts. This not only further strengthened the relationship between leaders and the masses and strengthened leadership over the front line, but also vigorously improved enterprise management, enabling many problems that had been unsolvable for a long time to be quickly resolved. For example, since the leading cadres of Tai Xin, Xi'an, Fuguo, and Pinggang four mines of the Liaoyuan Mining Bureau divided the work at all levels to engage in experimental fields in early September, they have successively broken through two hundred key production problems, making the average daily output of the entire bureau in September increase by 153% compared with August.

At present, coal mining enterprises in various regions are continuing to vigorously grasp the work of the work team on the basis of enriching and strengthening the front line of production, in order to fully exert the combat role of grass-roots organizations. Many coal mines in Jingxi, Kailuan, Datong, and Fuxin have adjusted the leadership and technical forces of the work teams, and all work teams have established groups with the Party group leader as the core. This not only strengthened the political and ideological leadership of the work teams, but also strengthened organizational leadership, so that all work teams can do everything with someone to do it and everyone has something to manage. In order to make the current new upsurge in the competition develop in depth and persistently, all mines have also made proper arrangements for all links necessary to ensure continuous high production, such as production preparation and coal transportation, while organizing high-yield competitions. In addition to transferring a large number of laborers from auxiliary departments to enrich tunneling teams and repair teams, many mines have also accelerated the construction of coal bunkers and small railways. Many mines have also established a regular equipment maintenance and repair system, greatly reducing mechanical and electrical accidents. These have laid a reliable material foundation for all coal industry workers and staff to fight the fourth quarter and strive for a complete production success. (Attached picture)

    大干四季度争取满堂红
    全国煤炭职工全力夺高产
    各地煤矿狠抓班组工作，采煤、掘进、运输全面跃进
    新华社15日讯　一个为钢铁工业“屯粮聚草”、夺取煤炭高产的竞赛新高潮，已经在全国煤矿中迅速形成，因而促使煤炭生产蒸蒸日上。在煤炭产量节节上升的同时，各矿在煤炭运输、巷道掘进、机电检修、安全生产等方面，也都出现了全面跃进的新局面。
    全国煤矿部门这次夺取煤炭高产的竞赛新高潮，是在广大职工广泛讨论今年以来工农业跃进新形势和总结煤炭工业生产成就的基础上出现的，因而一开始就具备了既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实的特点。各地煤矿企业不但从局到矿，从矿到采区，从采区到班组，从班组到个人，层层制订了增产节约计划和具体保证措施，而且在这基础上，各矿和各采区、坑口、生产队、班组之间，都开展了热火朝天的对手赛、表演赛、攻关赛、协作赛、一条龙赛和标兵选拔赛等多种多样的大比大赛。如鹤壁煤矿职工为了实现他们向全国煤矿提出的倡议条件，全矿二千多个班组全部投入了“工作面千吨赛”、“掘进千米双千米赛”、“机电百日无事故赛”和“五大指标赛”（产量、质量、效率、安全、成本）等，而且做到所有工人和班组都有明确的竞赛对手和目标。淮南煤矿两千多个采掘小组在开展“定起点、步步高”（以平均先进定额为竞赛起点，然后争取步步提高）的竞赛后，仅9月20日到25日的六天内，就有八百八十多个班组突破了起点。9月份，这个矿超额完成了国家计划，平均日产量比8月份提高9％以上。其他如大同、峰峰、萍乡、新汶、井陉等煤矿，也由于广泛开展了以班组为基础的大比大赛，9月份以来生产幅度都有很大增长。特别是在9月下旬开展的向国庆献礼的高产旬中，这些矿的平均日产量都比上中旬分别提高了10％到30％以上。
    在竞赛中，广大职工见先进就学，见后进就帮，使技术革新和技术革命成果进一步普及，先进经验也更加配套成龙。淮南、抚顺、峰峰、大同等煤矿职工为了在竞赛中迅速地提高生产水平，掀起了学习与推广先进经验的热潮，不仅要学习与推广本单位的先进经验，也要学习与推广竞赛对手创造的先进经验。有些局矿还用翻箱倒箧、寻师访贤的办法，把矿内外各种大小新老经验汇集起来，培养出许多“多宝合一”的采煤班，“多宝合一”的掘进队，“多宝合一”的电铲和“多宝合一”的电机车等。在这些竞赛中，各种具有一技之长的能工巧匠，已被大量发掘出来。开滦煤矿组织了一百多个标兵到处“传经”、“送宝”，巡回推广采煤、支柱、回柱、电溜子维护、机车安全运转等十一套先进经验，半个月内就解决了二百多个生产关键。现在，这个矿的许多标兵还发扬了共产主义风格，自动报名到后进组去生根落户，帮助后进班组迅速攻破生产关键。
    各级领导干部积极响应党的号召，到生产第一线去既当生产员，又当指挥员，给正在开展竞赛的职工群众带来了极大的鼓舞和有力支持。据大同、淮南、京西、淄博、鹤岗等九个煤矿的统计，到9月底由矿务局、矿两级领导机构下放到采煤区、队、班组去的干部和技术人员就有五千多人。他们在到达生产现场之后，与工人同时下井，同时升井，有效地发挥了同吃同住同劳动同商量的威力，及时了解和解决了很多生产问题。在下放干部的同时，阜新、鸡西等许多矿还展开了“老将归队”的活动。很多脱产多年的老技工纷纷回到原来的工作岗位，用他们的模范行动和熟练的技术，带领群众增产煤炭。除此以外，各矿还普遍建立和健全了井下办公制、领导人员值班制，以及各级领导干部到采煤班、生产队、掘进组去种试验田和跟班劳动等制度，不但进一步密切了领导同群众的关系，加强了对第一线的领导，同时还有力地改进了企业管理，使许多过去长期无法解决的问题迅速得到解决。如辽源矿务局太信、西安、富国、平岗四矿领导干部自9月初层层分工大搞试验田后，已经先后突破了二百个生产关键，使全局9月份平均日产量比8月提高了153％。
    目前，各地煤矿企业正在充实和加强生产第一线的基础上继续狠抓班组工作，以便充分发挥基层组织的战斗作用。京西、开滦、大同、阜新等许多煤矿都调整了班组的领导和技术力量，各班组都建立了以党小组长为核心的小组。这样，既加强了班组的政治思想领导，又加强了组织领导，使所有班组都能做到事事有人干，人人有事管。为了使当前已经出现的竞赛新高潮深入持久地发展下去，各矿在组织高产竞赛的同时，对保证持续高产必须的生产准备和煤炭运输等各个环节，也都作了妥善的安排。许多矿除了从辅助部门抽调大批劳动力充实掘进队、检修队外，还加快了煤仓和小铁路的修建工作。许多矿还建立了经常的设备维护检修制度，使机电事故大大减少。这些，都为全体煤炭工业职工大战第四季度，争取生产满堂红，奠定了可靠的物质基础。（附图片）
