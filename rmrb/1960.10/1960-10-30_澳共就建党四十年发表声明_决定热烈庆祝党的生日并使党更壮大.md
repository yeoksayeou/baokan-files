Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, October 27th: The Communist Party of Australia will warmly celebrate the 40th anniversary of its founding on October 30th.

    The "Tribune" weekly published on the 26th a statement issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Australia, saying that this is a festival for the Australian workers' movement, because it marks the day when "the most advanced thinkers of the Australian workers' movement and socialist movement" pointed out a new path for the workers' movement. The statement pointed out that the world communist movement has achieved tremendous development since the founding of the Communist Party of Australia. The statement said that the Communist Party of Australia celebrates its 40th anniversary and also celebrates the achievements of communism worldwide, "achievements that make the ruling class tremble." The statement said that the government's amendment of the notorious criminal law is a symptom of this fear, but, the statement said, no matter what, communist ideas cannot be eliminated by law. The statement said that Menzies had tried to do this before, just as Hitler had done before him, but both of them failed.

    The statement said, "The Communist Party of Australia has overcome all kinds of attacks because it is based on the fine traditions of the Australian people."

    The statement called on the masses to make the party stronger to celebrate the party's birthday. On October 30th, the party will hold a series of mass rallies to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the party's founding and will hold other celebrations.

    澳共就建党四十年发表声明
    决定热烈庆祝党的生日并使党更壮大
    据新华社27日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚共产党将于10月30日热烈庆祝建党四十周年。
    “论坛”周报26日刊载的澳大利亚共产党中央委员会发表的一篇声明说，这是澳大利亚工人运动的节日，因为它标志着“澳大利亚工人运动和社会主义运动中最先进的思想家”为工人运动指出新道路的日子。声明指出，澳大利亚共产党成立以来世界共产主义运动获得了巨大发展。声明说，澳大利亚共产党庆祝自己成立四十周年，同时也庆祝共产主义在世界范围内的成就，“这些成就使统治阶级胆战心惊”。声明说，政府修改臭名昭彰的刑法是这种惧怕心理的症状，但是，声明说，无论怎样，共产主义思想是不能用法律来消灭的。声明说，以前孟席斯曾企图这样做，正如希特勒在他之前所做过的那样，但这两个人都失败了。
    声明说，“澳大利亚共产党战胜了种种进攻，因为它是以澳大利亚人民的优良传统为基础的。”
    声明呼吁群众使党更加壮大，以庆祝党的生日。10月30日党将举行一系列的群众大会来庆祝党成立四十周年，并将举行其它庆祝活动。
