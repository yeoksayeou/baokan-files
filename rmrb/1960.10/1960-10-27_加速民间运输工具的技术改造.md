    Accelerate Technical Transformation of Civilian Transportation Tools
    The mass movement for the autumn agricultural product procurement is in full swing. The transport of various agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, oil, and sugar, as well as various light industrial raw materials and industrial products, will gradually become busy. Strengthening short-distance transportation is becoming increasingly urgent. In order to do a good job in short-distance transportation, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council stated in the "Instructions on Launching a Mass Movement for Autumn Agricultural Product Procurement": "Do everything possible to improve transportation efficiency, complete transportation tasks, and save labor and transportation capacity." This is the guiding principle for carrying out the mass movement for short-distance transportation. The central requirement of this principle is that transportation tasks must be completed, transportation efficiency must be improved, we must not rely on increasing labor, and we must try as much as possible to save some labor from the transportation front to strengthen agricultural production.
    Can the efficiency of short-distance transportation be improved? Can we increase transportation capacity and save labor at the same time? The answer to this from many facts is affirmative. The news about short-distance transportation in Anhui Province published in this newspaper on October 20 is one of them. From January to September this year, the total freight volume of short-distance transportation completed in Anhui Province increased by 76.5% compared with the same period last year, while the labor force decreased by nearly half. The main method in Anhui Province is to actively reform civilian transportation tools. By the end of September, the province had reformed and manufactured more than 900,000 handcarts, flatbed carts, horse-drawn carts, ox carts, animal-powered trains, etc., and modified and built more than 5,000 motorized sailboats and wooden sailboats; at the same time, some highways, plank roads, and rural roads were repaired. This means that as long as the technical transformation of civilian transportation tools is accelerated, transportation efficiency can not only be improved, but also greatly improved; labor can not only be saved, but also greatly saved. The requirement to "complete transportation tasks and save labor and transportation capacity" can be fully realized.
    According to statistics, civilian transportation tools currently undertake local material transportation tasks, generally accounting for about 75% of the short-distance freight volume. This is a huge force. Unfortunately, some comrades still lack sufficient understanding of this force. They dislike the backwardness of civilian transportation tools. When it comes to improving the efficiency of short-distance transportation, they always want to replace them all at once with modern transportation tools such as cars, wheeled vehicles, and trains. This idea is unrealistic. In a large country like ours, the modernization of short-distance transportation cannot be achieved in a month or two, or a year or two. We must resolutely implement the policy of "walking on two legs," on the one hand, we must give full play to the role of modern transportation tools; on the other hand, we must give full play to the role of civilian transportation tools. At present, under the condition of limited modern transportation tools, fully utilizing the role of civilian transportation tools is the most realistic and economical method. Compared with modern transportation tools, civilian transportation tools are indeed much more backward. However, by doing everything possible and implementing technical transformation, the backward situation can also be changed. After some civilian transportation tools are transformed, their transportation efficiency can not only be increased by dozens of percent, but even doubled. According to incomplete statistics from sixteen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, after the original two-wheeled animal-powered vehicles were changed to three-wheeled or four-wheeled and horse-drawn four-wheeled trailers, the efficiency generally increased by about one time. Baotou City Second Transportation Company, on the basis of horse-drawn trailer transportation, first changed the two-wheeled main vehicle to a four-wheeled main vehicle, and then enlarged the trailer, so the load capacity increased five times compared with before. After that, they also vigorously promoted sailing based on the windy characteristics of the Baotou area, and each sailing vehicle increased the traction force by one horsepower compared with pure animal power. Now, this transportation company has nineteen horse-drawn carts that have reached the peak of producing 10,000 ton-kilometers per month. The ox cart steel protection team of the Qijiang County Transportation Company in Sichuan Province, due to the vigorous promotion of ox cart train formation, also achieved a monthly output of 10,000 ton-kilometers, which is three times higher than in the past. It is the same use of oxen, horses, donkeys, and mules to pull carts, why couldn't they pull more in the past, but now they can pull more? Is it because the strength of the livestock has become one time, two times, or three times greater? No, it is the vehicles that have changed. Old-fashioned vehicles were bulky, and the rolling resistance was high. In a two-wheeled cart, the livestock also had to bear the pressure; after the reform, the vehicles changed from bulky to light, two wheels became three wheels, four wheels, or six wheels, and the livestock no longer bore the pressure, only used pulling force. In addition, the vehicles were equipped with ball bearings, the friction force was small, and the inertia was large. With such a change, in the past, one or two livestock could only pull one cart, but now they can pull a train; in the past, they pulled less and walked slowly, but now they pull more and run faster. According to existing experience, after technical transformation, transportation efficiency can be quickly improved, not only for animal-powered vehicles such as ox carts and horse-drawn carts, but also for other handcarts, wooden sailboats, and all civilian transportation tools, as long as they are transformed according to the characteristics of the vehicle (boat), transportation efficiency can be greatly improved. For example, the 2,400-plus tons of wooden sailboats of the Changde County Transportation People's Commune in Hunan Province have fully realized "buoyancy," and the average load capacity of each boat is even more than the load capacity of two boats in the past. Reforming civilian transportation tools and improving transportation efficiency is by no means an expedient measure. When the realistic conditions do not yet allow the full use of modern transportation tools, accelerating the technical transformation of civilian transportation tools is not only necessary for completing the current short-distance transportation tasks quickly and economically, but also indispensable for relying on civilian transportation tools to complete short-distance transportation tasks for a considerable period in the future. Of course, while emphasizing the reform of vehicles and the pulling of more materials, we must strengthen the care of livestock and the maintenance of vehicles. If we ignore this point, we cannot achieve the effect of being faster, better, and more economical.
    Relying on the broad masses, using local materials, and adapting to local conditions are the fastest ways to transform civilian transportation tools. Anhui Province only used nine months to transform civilian transportation tools, the transportation volume increased by 76.5%, and the labor force was saved by nearly half; the staff of the Tong County Transportation Department in Beijing worked hard for seven months and modified and manufactured nearly 300 transportation tools (boats), which increased transportation efficiency by about 70%. Are the conditions in Anhui and Tong County particularly good? No. Taking Tong County as an example, they encountered difficulties such as no equipment, no technology, and no materials when reforming transportation tools. Their main experiences are two: first, fully mobilize the masses and launch a mass movement; second, adapt to local conditions and use local materials. Once the masses are truly mobilized, all difficulties are overcome one by one. The "trackless train" refitted by Tong County using old boiler locomotives is not only suitable for the local natural geography and the characteristics of transporting goods, but also does not require gasoline or diesel as fuel, and is equivalent to the transportation capacity of twenty ordinary horse-drawn carts. Experiences like those in Anhui and Beijing exist everywhere. We should seriously summarize and promote the existing experiences and bring transportation efficiency to a new level.
    Mobilizing the broad masses, doing everything possible to accelerate the technical transformation of civilian transportation tools, improving transportation efficiency, and saving labor are important tasks for the transportation sector at present.

### 加速民间运输工具的技术改造

    加速民间运输工具的技术改造
    秋季农产品收购的群众运动，正在全面开展。粮食、棉花、油料、糖料等各种农副产品，各种轻工业原料和各种工业产品的调运工作，将逐渐繁忙起来。加强短途运输是越来越迫切的了。为了做好短途运输，中共中央、国务院在“关于大搞秋季农产品收购运动的指示”里说：“千方百计地提高运输效率，既要完成运输任务，又要节约劳动力和运输力。”这是开展短途运输群众运动的方针。这一方针的中心要求，就是运输任务必须完成，运输效率必须提高，不能依靠增加劳动力，而且还要尽可能地从运输战线上节约出一些劳动力，来加强农业生产。
    短途运输的效率能不能提高呢？能不能做到既增加运输能力，又节约劳动力呢？许多事实的答复是肯定的。本报10月20日刊载的安徽省短途运输的消息就是其中的一个。安徽省今年1至9月份，全省完成的短途运输总货运量比去年同期增长76.5％，而劳动力却少了将近一半。安徽省的主要办法，就是积极改革民间运输工具。到9月底，全省改革和制造手推车、平板车、马车、牛车、畜力列车等九十多万辆，改装和新造机帆船、木帆船共五千多艘；同时修整了一些公路、板车道和乡村大道。这就是说，只要加速对民间运输工具的技术改造，运输效率不只是可以提高，而且是可以大大提高；劳动力不只是可以节约，而且是可以大大节约。“既要完成运输任务，又要节约劳动力和运输力”的要求，是完全能够实现的。
    据统计，目前民间运输工具担负的地方物资运输任务，一般占短途运输货运量的75％左右。这是一个巨大的力量。可惜有的同志对于这支力量还缺乏足够的认识。他们嫌民间运输工具落后，一讲到提高短途运输效率，总想一下子统统以汽车、轮车、火车等近代运输工具来代替。这种想法是不切实际的。在我们这样一个大国里，实现短途运输现代化，决不是一月两月、一年两年内所能办到的。必须坚决贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，一方面要发挥现代化运输工具的作用；一方面要发挥民间运输工具的作用。而在目前近代运输工具有限的条件下，充分发挥民间运输工具的作用则是最现实、最节约的办法。民间运输工具比起近代运输工具来，确实落后得多。但是，千方百计，实行技术改造，落后的状况也是可以改变的。有些民间运输工具经过改造，其运输效率不但可以提高百分之几十，甚至可以成倍地提高。根据全国十六个省、市、自治区不完全统计，原有二轮畜力车改为三轮或四轮和马拉四轮挂车后，效率一般提高一倍左右。包头市第二运输公司，在马车拖挂运输的基础上，先把两轮主车改为四轮主车，又把拖车改大，载重量就比以前提高了五倍。之后，他们又根据包头地区多风的特点，大搞风帆化，每台风帆车又比纯畜力增加一马力的牵引力。现在，这个运输公司已经有十九辆马车，攀上了车吨月产万吨公里的高峰。四川省綦江县运输公司牛车保钢队，由于大搞牛车列车化，月产也达到了万吨公里，比过去提高了三倍。同样是用牛、马、驴、骡拉车，为什么过去不能多拉，而现在却能多拉了呢？是牲畜的力气变大一倍、两倍、三倍了吗？不是，是车辆变了。旧式车辆笨重，流动阻力大，两个轱轳的架子车，牲畜还要承受压力；经过改革，车辆由笨重变为轻巧，两轮变为三轮、四轮或六轮，牲畜不承受压力，只使用拉力。加上车辆安上滚珠轴承，摩擦力小了，惯性大了。这么一变，过去一头或两头牲畜只拉一辆车，现在可以拉一列；过去拉得少、走得慢，现在就拉得多、跑得快了。根据已有经验，经过技术改造，很快就提高了运输效率的，不仅仅有牛车、马车等畜力车，其它手推车、木帆船以及一切民间运输工具只要因车（船）制宜地进行改造，运输效率都可能大大提高。例如：湖南省常德县运输人民公社的二千四百多吨木帆船，全面实现了“浮力化”，平均每只船的载重量比过去两只船的载重量还多。改革民间运输工具，提高运输效能，决不是权宜之计。当现实条件还不可能全部采用近代运输工具的时候，加速对民间运输工具的技术改造，不只是多快好省地完成当前的短途运输任务所必需，即使今后一个相当长时期内，依靠民间运输工具完成短途运输任务也是不可缺少的。当然，在强调改革车辆、多拉物资的同时，必须加强对牲畜的爱护和车辆的维修保养。如果忽视了这一点，也不能收到多快好省的效果。
    依靠广大群众，就地取材，因地制宜，是改造民间运输工具的最快的道路。安徽省只用九个月改造民间运输工具，运输量增长76.5％，劳动力节约近一半；北京市通县运输部门的职工，大干七个月，就改装和制造了运输工具近三百辆（艘），使运输效率提高了70％左右。是不是安徽和通县的条件特别好呢？不是。拿通县来讲，他们在改革运输工具的时候，就碰到了没有设备、没有技术、没有材料的困难。他们的主要经验有两条，一是充分发动群众，大搞群众运动；二是因地制宜，就地取材。群众真正发动起来了，一切困难就一个个被制服了。通县用旧的锅驼机改装的“无轨火车”，既适合本地自然地理和运送货物的特点，又不需要汽油或柴油作燃料，等于二十辆普通马车的运输能力。像安徽、北京等地的经验，各地都有。应该认真总结和推广已有的经验，把运输效率提到新的水平。
    发动广大群众，千方百计地加速对民间运输工具的技术改造，提高运输效率，节约劳动力，这就是当前运输部门的一项重要任务。
