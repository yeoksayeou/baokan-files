“France Federation News” Says China is Determined to Change its “Poor and Blank” Face; The Great Leap Forward Plays a Decisive Role in the Development of Socialist Construction
    Paris "France Federation News" published a long report on China on October 1.
    The report said: Under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party has taken deep root among the people through years of heroic struggle. It has taken on the major task of changing the economy of this "poor and blank" country and leading it onto the socialist road.
    Eleven years have passed, and in these years, with the enthusiastic support of the Chinese people (without whom nothing could be done) and with the assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the Communist Party has changed the face of the country.
    1958 was a landmark year in Chinese history. This was the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, and it was the year of the Great Leap Forward. According to the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical, the Great Leap Forward played a decisive role in the development of socialist construction in all aspects.
    In this year, more than 740,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives were merged and reorganized into 26,000 people's communes. By the end of this year, 120 million farm households, accounting for 99% of all farm households, had joined the people's communes. Due to this organizational form, agricultural output reached twice the amount increased during the First Five-Year Plan. In these communes, industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs were all integrated.
    The progress made in the past two years has obviously overturned the current Five-Year Plan, and its main indicators have been completed three years ahead of schedule. Therefore, a supplementary plan had to be formulated. In the coming years, the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture will continue to be implemented. Special attention will be paid to agricultural technology reform in order to strive for higher yields.
    In industry, emphasis is always placed on the simultaneous development of large and small enterprises. As for whether these enterprises use the latest methods or "indigenous" methods, it does not matter; what is important is to develop production.
    The report said that pioneering spirit is encouraged among the people. A magnificent movement of technological innovation and revolution has been formed, aimed at reducing heavy labor and seeking all raw materials.
    The new plan also emphasizes the development of light industry, cotton weaving, clothing, hat making, sugar making, edible oil, and so on.
    The report concluded: On the occasion of the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the summary made by the leaders of the People's Republic of China has been celebrated by the entire people, and their confidence has been further strengthened.

    “法兰西联邦新闻”说 
    中国立志改变“一穷二白”面貌
    大跃进对社会主义建设的发展起决定性作用
    巴黎“法兰西联邦新闻”10月1日发表了一篇关于中国的长篇报道。
    报道说：中国共产党在毛泽东领导下，在多年的英勇斗争中，已在人民中扎下了很深的根。它担负起了改变这个“一穷二白”的国家的经济和使这个国家走上社会主义道路的重大任务。
    十一年过去了，在这些年代中，共产党在中国人民（要是没有他们是什么也不能干的）的热情支持下，在苏联和其他社会主义国家的援助下，改变了国家的面貌。
    1958年是中国历史上的划时代之年。这是第二个五年计划的头一年，这是大跃进之年。根据多、快、好、省的原则，大跃进对于各方面的社会主义建设的发展起了决定性的作用。
    这一年，七十四万多个农业生产合作社，合并来改组为二万六千个人民公社。这年年底，一亿二千万个农户，占全体农户的99％，参加了人民公社。由于这种组织形式，农业产量达到了第一个五年计划期间所增加的数量的两倍。在这些公社中，工、农、商、学、兵都合一了。
    最近两年中取得的进展，显然已推翻了现行的五年计划，它的主要指标已提前三年完成。因此，不得不制订一个补充计划。在未来几年中，将继续执行工农业同时并举的政策。人们将特别注意农业技术改革，以便争取更高的产量。
    在工业方面，始终是强调大小企业同时发展。至于这些企业是使用最新式的方法，还是使用“土”办法，这倒不要紧，重要的是要发展生产。
    报道说，在人民中鼓励首倡精神。已经形成了目的在于减轻重劳动、寻求一切原料的壮阔的技术革新和革命运动。
    在新的计划中，也强调发展轻工业、棉织业、衣帽业、制糖、食油等等。
    报道最后说：值此建国十一周年之际，中华人民共和国领导人所作的总结，受到了全体人民的欢庆，他们的信心更加强了。
