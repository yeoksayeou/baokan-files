    Li Chunhua is the Confidant of Veteran Workers
    By our correspondent in Gansu
    Li Chunhua, the Party Secretary of Xinhe Coal Mine in Shandan County, Gansu Province, has long adhered to the "Four Togethernesses," making close friends with veteran workers and rooting himself among them. This has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses, promoted the continuous rise of production in the mine, and by October 15th, it had overfulfilled the annual production plan by 12.5%, becoming one of the advanced units in the county.
    
    He has a notebook in his pocket with the names of veteran workers written on it.
    
    Xinhe Coal Mine is a coal mine mainly using indigenous methods of extraction. The characteristics of this coal mine are: complex geological structure, large changes in coal seams, abundant underground water, but the quality of the coking coal produced is very good. In the autumn of 1958, during the Great Leap Forward in steel production, the Shandan County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party transferred Li Chunhua, who was then the Deputy Secretary of the Party General Branch in Weiqi Township, to Xinhe Coal Mine to serve as the Party Secretary. Li Chunhua came from a poor peasant background and only attended school for one year. Although he grew up in the fields and had no experience in industrial production, under the cultivation and education of the Party, he deeply realized that close ties with the masses, relying on the masses, and following the mass line are the great magic weapons for leading the cause of socialist construction. Therefore, this young Party Secretary confidently took on the new position. Since arriving at Xinhe Coal Mine in 1958, carrying his luggage, he has settled down among the masses according to the instructions of the Party. In the process of eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the broad masses of workers, he gradually became close friends with veteran workers Yang Shengchun, Liu Keqin, Gao Yiguo, Wang Kewen, and Wang Tingzhen. These veteran workers started climbing into small coal pits in their teens, spending half of their lives underground, so they had rich experience in underground production and loved the mine. After Li Chunhua became close friends with them, these veteran workers became his strong support for carrying out his work.
    
    Li Chunhua's approach to getting close to veteran workers is mainly to carry forward the fine style of revolutionary cadres going deep into the masses and eating, living, laboring, and consulting with them. After Li Chunhua came to Xinhe Coal Mine, he first recorded the names of all the veteran workers in the mine in his notebook. He remembered in detail where these veteran workers lived, which mining area they were distributed in, and which pit entrance they were at. Li Chunhua had only been at the mine for a few days when he found the home of veteran worker Yang Shengchun. When Yang Shengchun saw the Party Secretary, he hurriedly cleaned up a clean spot on the kang (brick bed). Li Chunhua was not polite and sat down on the kang. He said, "Old Yang, I'm here to work with coal, how can I mind the dirt? Don't bother cleaning." Then he started chatting with this veteran worker about coal mine production.
    
    Veteran workers are like a textbook on underground production; they answer whatever you ask.
    
    Yang Shengchun is in his forties this year and has been mining coal in this desolate mountain gully since he was a teenager, climbing in and out of the mine dozens of feet deep. Therefore, when underground production was mentioned, Yang Shengchun's floodgates opened. He explained the coal seams and roof to the Party Secretary, and after talking about coal mining, he discussed tunneling, but Li Chunhua couldn't make head or tail of it. When Yang Shengchun saw that the Party Secretary didn't understand the business, he was even more anxious than Li Chunhua. He immediately picked up his mine lamp and said, "Secretary! Let's go! I'll take you down the mine and point it out to you." In this way, veteran worker Yang Shengchun gave Party Secretary Li Chunhua his first lesson on coal mining production. After coming out of the mine, Li Chunhua asked Yang Shengchun to gather several veteran workers from the mine and hold a forum in front of the cave dwellings. At this first meeting with the veteran workers, Li Chunhua revealed his background, explaining that he came from the countryside and needed to learn how to lead coal mine production, and that he would learn from everyone. Then, he asked the veteran workers to share the heavy burden and divide the responsibility for underground mining. This frank and sincere conversation made the veteran workers feel that the Secretary had first confided in them, and that the Party Secretary not only understood them but also trusted them. From then on, veteran workers Yang Shengchun, Wang Kewen, Gao Yiguo, Wang Tingzhen, and Liu Keqin began to fix pit entrances, each responsible for one or two pits, leading the production team, and taking charge of underground production, turning a new page in the participation of Xinhe Coal Mine workers in underground production management.
    
    For the past two years, Li Chunhua has maintained close contact with the veteran workers. He labored together with these veteran workers, talked with them, and consulted them for solutions to difficult problems in production. Regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter, whichever pit entrance he climbed out of, he would eat with the workers in that mining area. Whichever worker's residence was nearby, he would sleep there. Sometimes, if he came out of the mine late at night, Li Chunhua would put on an old sheepskin coat and sleep with the workers by the fire pit at the entrance of the mine. Whenever the veteran workers went down the mine, Li Chunhua often followed behind. When the veteran workers were tapping the roof for safety, Li Chunhua also learned to do the same. The Party Secretary listened carefully to the veteran workers' explanations and stood on-site for practice, holding a hammer. At the working face, Li Chunhua often took the pickaxe from the veteran workers and learned to mine coal himself. At first, the pickaxe in his hand was uncontrollable, hitting east and west and not digging accurately. Under the guidance of the veteran workers, he gradually learned the skill of digging diagonally along the coal seam. The veteran workers were like a textbook on underground production; they could give satisfactory answers to all production problems. In this way, Li Chunhua, as an ordinary soldier in underground production, formed a close relationship with the five veteran workers. In front of these five veteran workers, he learned all the underground production knowledge such as coal mining, timbering, ventilation, preventing roof collapses, and dealing with water in old lanes. This valuable production knowledge became the important basis for the Party Secretary to direct the mining work of the entire mine.
    
    In 1959, the Dashanwan Well of Xinhe Coal Mine continued to experience roof collapses, affecting safety and production. In order to solve this key problem, Li Chunhua wanted to use stones instead of pit props for support, but he was not sure. When he told the veteran workers about this, they strongly supported it and immediately worked out a method of building arches with rough stones underground. This was in line with the Party's policy of running enterprises diligently and frugally, and it was supported by the masses. Veteran worker Liu Keqin took the lead, leading workers to carry stones up the mountain, Yang Shengchun went down the mine to remove slag with Li Chunhua, and a masonry team with veteran workers participating was formed, quickly completing the pilot work of masonry with rough stones in the Dashanwan Well. Subsequently, this experience was widely promoted throughout the mine, not only saving a lot of pit props and preventing roof collapse accidents but also further ensuring safe production.
    
    The Secretary's key unlocked the veteran workers'窍门 (knack)
    
    In the process of contacting the workers, Li Chunhua often mentioned the technical transformation of small coal pits, soliciting everyone's opinions. In this regard, the new workers were always eager to try, wishing they could start immediately, but some veteran workers were not very enthusiastic. Over time, after Li Chunhua became close friends with the veteran workers, some people revealed their thoughts to the Secretary. It turned out that some veteran workers felt that during the Great Leap Forward in steel production, there was an urgent need for coking coal. Small coal pit mining was fast, labor-saving, and could quickly reach the coal seam, ensuring quick coal production. They believed that technical transformation was too troublesome and would affect coal production. After learning about the veteran workers' feelings, Li Chunhua educated everyone, saying that production should not only focus on the present but also have great ambitions and see the development prospects of the coal mine. Xinhe Coal Mine has a certain amount of reserves and should plan for decades of mining. To increase production significantly, technical transformation of small coal pits is the best way. This was really a key to unlock a lock. The veteran workers' plan was to produce more coal, and technical transformation of small coal pits was precisely for greatly increasing production, which was in line with their intentions. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the veteran workers was greatly mobilized, and they rushed to participate in the construction of the shafts.
    
    Knowing the workers' strengths and weaknesses, the purpose is to better help them.
    
    Li Chunhua's deep friendship with the veteran workers is not only established in labor production but also in daily life. When veteran worker Yang Shengchun was sick and unable to walk, it was the young Secretary who carried him from the mining area to the clinic. When veteran worker Gao Yiguo had difficulties learning to read, it was the young Secretary who designated someone to teach the veteran worker how to read. He not only asked the cultural instructor to pay special attention to checking Gao Yiguo's learning progress but also often helped and supervised him himself. As a result, Gao Yiguo was able to shed his illiteracy in a very short period. At the same time, Li Chunhua was very familiar with the characteristics of these veteran workers, understood their strengths and weaknesses, and was able to help them continuously improve, so that their enthusiasm and creativity were fully发挥 (brought into play).
    
    Now, these veteran workers that Li Chunhua interacts with, some are already the mining area directors of Xinhe Coal Mine, and some are the production team leaders, all becoming the backbone of Xinhe Coal Mine. Among them, Wang Kewen and Liu Keqin have both joined the Chinese Communist Party this year. Wang Tingzhen, a veteran worker who was transferred to work in a farm in Shandan County, often returns to Xinhe Coal Mine to consult with his confidant Li Chunhua when he encounters problems at work.
    
    Li Chunhua not only became close friends with five veteran workers but also became familiar with more than sixty veteran workers in the mine through them. Li Chunhua had a good understanding of which veteran worker had a large family, which veteran worker had a set of experiences in mining small coal pits, who liked to drink, and who didn't like to talk. These veteran workers were also familiar with the Secretary and could talk to him. Anyone who had a knot in their heart was happy to talk to Li Chunhua, which greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of the veteran workers.

    李春华是老工人的知心朋友
    本报驻甘肃记者
    甘肃省山丹县新河煤矿党委书记李春华长期坚持“四同”，和老工人交知心朋友，把根子扎在老工人当中，从而大大发挥了群众的积极性，促进全矿生产持续上升，到10月15日，已超额12.5％完成了全年生产计划，成为全县的先进单位之一。
    他口袋里有个本子，上面记下了老工人的姓名
    新河煤矿是一个以土法开采为主的煤矿。这个煤矿的特点是：地质构造复杂，煤层变化大，地下水多，出产的焦煤质量却很好。在大炼钢铁的1958年秋天，中共山丹县委抽调当时在位奇乡担任党总支副书记的李春华到新河煤矿担任党委书记。李春华是贫农出身，只念过一年书。他虽然在庄稼地里长大，没有搞过工业生产，但是在党的培养教育下，他深刻地认识到密切联系群众，依靠群众，走群众路线，是领导社会主义建设事业的一大法宝。因而，这位年青的党委书记，满怀信心地走上了新的岗位。他从1958年背着行李来到新河煤矿以后，就按照党的指示，到群众中安家落户。在与广大职工同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量中，逐渐和老工人杨生春、刘克勤、高义国、王克文和王廷贞等五人交成知心朋友。这些老工人从十几岁就爬小煤窑，有一半岁月在井下度过，因而井下生产经验丰富，热爱矿山，李春华和他们交上知心朋友以后，这些老工人就成了他进行工作的有力靠山。
    李春华和老工人接近的方法，主要是发扬革命干部深入群众，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量的优良作风。李春华来到新河煤矿以后，首先在他的笔记本上记录了全矿老工人的姓名。这些老工人住在哪里，分布在哪个采区，哪个井口，他都记得很详细。李春华到矿没有几天，就找到老工人杨生春的家里，杨生春一见党委书记，慌忙收拾出炕上一块干净地方。李春华没有客气，上炕就坐下了。他说：“老杨，我是搞煤来了，怎么能嫌黑，你快别收拾。”接着就和这个老工人拉开了煤矿生产的家常话。
    老工人就像井下生产的一本教科书，问到哪答到哪
    杨生春今年四十多岁，从十几岁就在这荒凉的山窝里挖煤，在几十丈深的井下爬进爬出。因此，一提井下生产，杨生春的话匣子就打开了，他给党委书记讲完煤层讲顶板，说完采煤说掘进，但李春华却听不出个头绪来。杨生春一看党委书记不懂行，比李春华还着急，他立刻提起矿灯说：“书记！走！咱下井指点给你看。”就这样，老工人杨生春在井下给党委书记李春华上了采煤生产的第一课。出井以后，李春华就让杨生春邀集全矿的几个老工人，在窑洞前开了个座谈会。在跟老工人第一次见面的这个座谈会上，李春华就向老工人交了底，说明自己来自农村，要学习领导煤矿生产，一定向大家好好学习。然后，他要求老工人们，千斤担子大家担，分井包干，负责井下采掘。这一片开门见山、推心置腹的谈话，使老工人感觉到书记先向自己交了心，党委书记不但了解自己，而且信赖自己。打这儿起，老工人杨生春、王克文、高义国、王廷贞、刘克勤开始固定井口，每人包一两口井，领着生产队，负责井下生产，翻开了新河煤矿工人参加井下生产管理的第一页。
    两年来，李春华一直和老工人有着亲密的交往。他和这些老工人共同劳动，一起谈心，向他们请教解决生产中疑难问题的办法。不管春夏秋冬，他从哪个井口爬出来，就在哪个采区和工人一起吃饭。哪个工人的住所离得近，他就睡在哪里。有时候碰到深夜出井，李春华就披着老羊皮袄，和工人一起睡在井口的火窝子边。老工人每次下矿井时，李春华常常跟在后面，老工人在前边敲帮问顶的时候，李春华也学着来，这位党委书记一边用心听老工人讲，一边举着锤子站在现场实习。在掌子面上，李春华经常接过老工人手里的刨锤，自己学习采煤。开始时手里的刨锤不听使唤，指东打西挖不准，在老工人的指点下，他逐渐学会顺着煤层斜挖的本领。老工人就像井下生产的一本教科书，所有生产上的问题，他们都能给以满意的答复。就这样，李春华作为井下生产的普通一兵，和五位老工人结成了亲密的关系。他在这五位老工人面前，学会采煤，架柴、通风、防止冒顶和老巷水等一切井下生产知识，这些宝贵的生产知识，成了这位党委书记指挥全矿采掘工作的重要依据。
    1959年，新河煤矿的大山湾井不断发生冒顶现象，影响安全，影响生产。为了解决这个关键问题，李春华想用石头代替坑木支撑，但是他没有把握，这事向老工人一说，他们很支持，并且立即研究出用毛料石在井下砌碹的办法。这事合乎党的勤俭办企业的方针，受到群众的拥护。老工人刘克勤一马当先，带领工人上山背石头，杨生春下井跟着李春华动手扒渣，并且组成了有老工人参加的砌碹小组，很快就在大山湾井完成了毛料石砌碹的试点工作。接着，这一经验在全矿普遍推广，不仅节约了大量的坑木，防止了冒顶事故，而且进一步保证了安全生产。
    书记的钥匙打开了老工人的窍门
    李春华在和工人们接触过程中，经常提到小煤窑技术改造问题，征求大家的意见。对此，新工人总是跃跃欲试，恨不得立即动手，但有些老工人却劲头不大。天长日久，李春华和老工人交上知心朋友以后，有人才把心思掏给了书记。原来有些老工人觉得大炼钢铁，急需焦煤，小煤窑开采，打井快，省工，很快就能打到煤层，能保证快出煤，认为搞技术改造太费事，也影响出煤率。李春华了解到老工人这份心情以后，就教育大家，搞生产不能只顾眼前，还要有雄心大志，要看得见煤矿的发展前途。新河煤矿有一定的蕴藏量，要作几十年的开采打算，要想大幅度增产，进行小煤窑技术改造，是最好的办法。这可真是一把钥匙开一把锁，老工人的打算是多出煤，而进行小煤窑技术改造正是为了大幅度增产，正合他们的心意，因而大大调动了老工人的积极性，争前恐后地参加了井巷扩建工程。
    知道工人的长处，也知道他们的短处，目的是为了更好地帮助他们
    李春华和老工人的深情厚谊，不只建立在劳动生产中，也建立在日常生活中。老工人杨生春生病不能走路的时候，是这个年青的书记背着他从采区走向医务所。当老工人高义国学文化有困难的时候，是这位年青的书记，指定专人教这个老工人学习文化。他不但要求文化教员特别注意检查高义国的学习情况，自己也经常帮助和督促，因而使高义国在很短的时间里就摘掉了文盲帽子。同时，李春华非常熟悉这些老工人的特点，了解他们的长处和短处，能很好地帮助他们不断提高，使他们的积极性和创造性得到充分发挥。
    现在，李春华交往的这些老工人，有的已是新河煤矿的采区区长，有的是生产大队长，都成了新河煤矿的骨干力量。其中王克文和刘克勤都已在今年加入了中国共产党。调到山丹县一个农场去工作的老工人王廷贞，碰到工作上有什么问题的时候，还经常回到新河煤矿来找他的知心朋友李春华商量。
    李春华不仅和五个老工人交成知心朋友，还通过他们熟悉了全矿六十多个老工人。哪个老工人家里人口多，哪个老工人开采小煤窑有一套经验，谁爱喝酒，谁不爱说话，李春华心里都有个底。这些老工人也都和书记搞得熟，说得来。谁要是在心里有解不开扣的问题，也高兴去找李春华谈，这就大大调动了老工人的积极性。
