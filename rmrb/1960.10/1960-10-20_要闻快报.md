Jiangxi Launches High Tide of Manure Accumulation and Fertilizer Production

Jiangxi Province is launching a massive autumn manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaign to fully prepare sufficient base fertilizer for winter grain planting as early as possible.

Under the call of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, all localities have strengthened leadership, with Party committee secretaries at all levels taking personal command. They have mobilized the masses to implement manure accumulation in terms of quantity, quality, and timing according to the winter planting area, and have organized and transferred a total of approximately 1 million commune members to participate in the manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement.

While focusing on accumulating and producing farm manure, various localities have also arranged manpower and materials to vigorously produce chemical fertilizers. Now, many regions have achieved the goal of having factories in every commune and teams in every production brigade, stepping up the production of various types of local chemical fertilizers.

Jiangsu Universally Establishes Farm Tool Repair and Fitting Network

Jiangsu Province has established 162 semi-mechanized farm tool manufacturing and repair factories under counties and cities, 1,646 commune-level farm tool manufacturing and repair factories, and more than 16,000 production brigade-level farm tool repair factories. Many production teams are also equipped with farm tool repair personnel. At present, the number of farm tool manufacturing and repair factories/stations has nearly doubled compared to before communization, basically achieving the goal of having farm tool manufacturing and repair factories in every commune and repair stations in every production team, forming a well-connected farm tool repair network.

These repair factories have played a significant role in the repair and fitting of farm tools during this year's "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing), ensuring the timely repair and fitting of "Three Autumns" farm tools.

Plant Winter Sweet Potatoes on Uphill Terraces to Expand Planting Area

Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, has summarized the experience of planting miscellaneous grains on uphill terraces and is now widely promoting the planting of winter sweet potatoes on uphill terraces. Of the more than 100,000 mu of winter crops planted in the county, sweet potatoes planted on uphill terraces account for more than 80,000 mu.

Since the beginning of this year, various localities in Xinhui County have vigorously promoted the planting of miscellaneous grains on uphill terraces and have achieved success. This method of cultivation is simple, expands the planting area, and saves labor. Therefore, the county Party committee decided to plant 150,000 mu of winter sweet potatoes on uphill terraces, accounting for 30% of the winter planting plan.

"Plum Blossom" Stove Saves Firewood and Labor

The Lion King Commune in Santai County, Sichuan Province, mobilized the masses to vigorously innovate firewood burning techniques and universally promoted the "Plum Blossom" stove, which saves firewood, time, and labor, throughout the commune. Combining the use of the "Plum Blossom" stove, they also summarized a complete set of "three-good" experience for saving firewood, including building a good stove, managing fuel well, and mastering technology, reducing the commune's firewood consumption from the original 2.5 catties per person per day to 14 taels (old system). Cooking time per meal is shortened by more than half, fundamentally solving the problem of firewood shortage in winter in previous years. Currently, 70% of the commune canteens in Santai County have adopted this commune's advanced experience.

Busy Autumn Fishing Season on Qinghai Lake

Workers at various fishing grounds on Qinghai Lake are determined to fight hard during the autumn fishing season, turn the off-season into the peak season, and ensure the continued increase in fresh fish production. From June to the present, more than 4.3 million catties of naked carp have been caught. The current daily output continues to maintain a level of more than 50,000 catties.

To increase fish production, the workers are vigorously engaged in technological innovation. The newly successfully tested "light net fast towing" fishing method not only filters water quickly, increasing towing speed and doubling output, but also protects young fish and saves steel wire rope.

    要闻快报
    江西掀起积肥造肥高潮
    江西省掀起声势浩大的秋季积肥造肥运动，为冬季大办粮食及早备足基肥。
    在中共江西省委的号召下，各地都加强了领导，由各级党委书记亲自挂帅，发动群众按冬种面积落实了积肥数量、质量和时间，并组织和抽调了共约一百余万社员投入积肥造肥运动。
    各地在突击积造农家肥的同时，还安排人力、物力大造化肥。现在许多地区都达到了社社有厂、队队有厂，加紧生产各种土化肥。
    江苏普建农具修配网
    江苏全省已建立县、市所属的半机械化农具制造修配厂一百六十二个，公社农具制造修配厂一千六百四十六个，大队农具修配厂一万六千多个，不少生产队还配备了农具修配员。目前，农具制造修配厂“站”的数量比公社化前增加近一倍，基本做到社社有农具制造修配厂，队队有修配站，形成了一个四通八达的农具修配网。
    这些修配厂在今年“三秋”农具的修配工作中发挥了很大作用，保证了“三秋”农具的适时修配。
    上山打坎增种冬甘薯
    广东新会县总结了上山打坎种植杂粮的经验，今年普遍推广上山打坎种植冬番薯。全县已经种下的冬种杂粮十万多亩中，上山打坎种下的番薯占八万多亩。
    今年以来，新会县各地就大力推广上山打坎种植杂粮，获得成功。这种办法耕作简单，既扩大了面积，又能节约劳动力。因此，县委决定上山打坎种植冬薯十五万亩，占冬种计划百分之三十。
    梅花灶省柴草省劳力
    四川三台县狮王公社发动群众，大搞烧柴技术革新，在全社普遍推广了省柴、省时间、省劳力的“梅花灶”。结合使用梅花灶并且总结出一整套打好灶型、管好燃料，掌握好技术的“三好”一条龙的节约烧柴经验，使全社的烧柴量由原来每人每天二点五斤降至十四两（旧制）。每顿煮饭时间缩短一半多，从根本上解决了历年冬季缺烧柴的问题。现在三台县百分之七十的公社食堂已采用了这个公社的先进经验。
    青海湖上秋汛捕鱼忙
    青海湖上各渔场的职工，决心大战秋汛，把淡季变旺季，保证鲜鱼生产的持续上升。今年六月到现在，已捕获湟鱼四百三十多万斤。目前的日产量仍继续保持五万多斤的水平。
    为了提高鱼产量，职工们大闹技术革新，他们新近试验成功的“轻网快拖”捕鱼方法，不但滤水快，提高了引曳速度使产量提高了一倍，而且保护了幼鱼，节约了钢丝绳。
