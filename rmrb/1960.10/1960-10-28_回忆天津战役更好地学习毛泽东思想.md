Recalling the Tianjin Campaign to Better Learn Mao Zedong Thought
Liu Yalou

The Tianjin Campaign was an important siege warfare in the Chinese People's Liberation War, and it was the key to promoting the peaceful liberation of Beiping and the liberation of North China. The victory of the Tianjin Campaign was a victory for Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on people's war and strategic principles, a victory for the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army with the enthusiastic support of the people, and a victory for the close cooperation and joint struggle of our Party, government, army, and people.

This campaign was carried out after the Liberation War had gone through two and a half years, and it was carried out in the historical period when our army had turned from inferiority to superiority, and from defense to a national-scale offensive.

In the autumn of 1948, the Chinese People's Liberation Army had stopped the Kuomintang army's offensive and turned itself into a counter-offensive, launching large-scale autumn offensives on various battlefields simultaneously. In accordance with the wise strategic plan of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Northeast People's Liberation Army launched a full-line offensive on a front of more than 1,500 miles from Changchun in the north to Changli in the south. In just fifty-two days, it annihilated nearly 500,000 enemies and liberated fourteen cities remaining in the hands of the enemy. By November 2, 1948, when Shenyang was liberated, the entire Northeast was liberated. In less than three years, Chiang Kai-shek's one million troops on the Northeast battlefield, including several American-equipped corps of the "main force among the main forces," were completely wiped out. At that time, Chairman Mao pointed out regarding the new situation of the change in the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves after the Liaoshen Campaign: "The military situation in China has now entered a new turning point, that is, the balance of power between the two sides of the war has undergone a fundamental change. The People's Liberation Army not only has long held the advantage in quality, but now also has the advantage in quantity. This is a sign that the success of the Chinese revolution and the realization of peace in China are approaching." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, p. 1363)

In order to save their overall defeat, the US-Chiang clique carried out "peace" conspiracies on the one hand, "retired" Chiang Kai-shek, and brought Li Zongren to the fore, while on the other hand, they adjusted their deployments in an attempt to rebuild the defense line in the south of the Yangtze River. US imperialism also attempted to intervene in Qingdao and Shanghai in order to give the Kuomintang army a chance to breathe, preserve the remaining Kuomintang forces, and continue to be enemies of the Chinese people.

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao made a penetrating analysis of the situation at that time. They pointed out that the enemy's strategic front had completely disintegrated, the balance of class forces in our country had undergone new changes, and the revolutionary upsurge was stirring up all strata of society. The Kuomintang reactionary rule had been fundamentally shaken and had reached the point of disintegration and popular discontent. Such a situation posed a serious question to the Chinese people: Should the revolution be carried through to the end, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilating the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary armed forces and all reactionary forces, and striving for the complete victory of the Chinese people's revolution? Or should we give up halfway, stop in the face of US imperialism and the remaining Kuomintang military forces, allowing the enemy to win a breathing opportunity and then make a comeback? This was a major issue concerning the success or failure of our people's revolution. At this critical juncture, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao made the wise decision to carry the revolution through to the end.

Following the victories of the Suqi Campaign and the Jinan Campaign in the east and south, the famous Huaihai Campaign began. In the north, following the victory of the Liaoshen Campaign, the famous Pingjin Campaign was quickly organized; the Northwest battlefield also entered the counter-offensive; and guerrilla warfare was widely and deeply developed behind enemy lines. At the same time, in response to the US-Chiang "peace" conspiracy, Chairman Mao issued a statement on the current situation, proposing eight conditions for peace negotiations. The person in charge of the CCP Central Committee issued a comment saying, "In about another year, the Kuomintang reactionary government may be overthrown from its roots." The list of war criminals and the policy of punishing war criminals, as well as a series of policies for the newly liberated areas, were announced. It was precisely because of the wise decisions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, who firmly held the helm, that the Chinese revolution was able to proceed victoriously to the end along the correct path. The campaign to liberate North China was carried out under the guidance of such a strategic policy.

At that time, the Kuomintang still retained more than forty divisions of more than 500,000 troops in North China to continue to maintain the situation and cover the strategic deployment in the south of the Yangtze River. Isolated in North China, Fu Zuoyi was indecisive at this time: on the one hand, he shrank his forces and gathered them in the Ping, Jin, Zhang, and Tang lines, forming a one-character long snake formation, and negotiated with us to explore our army's intentions in order to protect himself; on the other hand, he communicated with Chiang Kai-shek's envoys, wanting to flee south to the south of the Yangtze River to join Chiang Kai-shek; and he also wanted to flee west to Suiyuan.

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao considered that if Fu Zuoyi's 500,000 troops fled south or west, it would have an adverse effect on the progress of the victory of the Liberation War. Therefore, it was decided that the main force of the Northeast Liberation Army - the Fourth Field Army - which had just ended the Liaoshen Campaign and was carrying out campaign rest, should quickly enter the pass and join the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army to jointly conduct the Pingjin Campaign, first cutting off Fu Zuoyi's retreat routes to the east and west, and then dividing and encircling them, "closing the door to beat the dog," in order to completely resolve the North China issue.

Under the command of Comrades Lin Biao and Luo Ronghuan, the Fourth Field Army resolutely implemented the instructions of the Central Committee, overcame various difficulties such as continuous operations without rest, and began to march into the pass on November 22, 1948, just twenty days after the end of the Liaoshen Campaign. At that time, the intention was: together with the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, first capture and annihilate Fu Zuoyi's main force on the Ping-Sui line, and drag the Chiang faction troops in the Pingjin area, seeking to annihilate all forty-four divisions of the defending enemies on the Ping, Jin, and Zhang lines in a short period of time. According to this intention, the 800,000 troops of the Fourth Field Army and the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army converged, divided into three routes, and marched side by side day and night to the North China battlefield, fully demonstrating our army's "style of courageous fighting, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous operations (that is, fighting several battles in a row without rest in a short period of time)." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, p. 1247).

The right-wing army attacked the Ping-Sui line from the south and the north. After nineteen consecutive days and nights of marching and chasing operations, they captured Miyun, occupied Huailai and Kangzhuang, and liberated Zhangjiakou. They annihilated 65,000 people, including the temporarily compiled Third and Fourth Army headquarters, seven divisions, and cavalry brigades of Fu Zuoyi's main force, and destroyed Fu Zuoyi's founding capital, and controlled the entire section of the Ping-Sui Road from Badaling to Zhangjiakou, cutting off Fu Zuoyi's westward escape route.

The main force of the Central Route Army attacked and advanced between Tianjin and Beiping. After eight days of marching and fighting, more than 5,000 enemies were annihilated. They approached the city of Beiping, seized the strategic material base of Fengtai and the Shijingshan Power Plant, and once attacked Deshengmen, completing the encirclement of the Beiping defenders. The connection between the Ping and Jin defenders was completely cut off.

At that time, "the only or main thing to fear was that the enemy would escape from the sea" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, p. 1370). After entering the customs, the main force of the Left Route Army advanced rapidly along the Beining Line. They successively captured Tangshan, Lutai, Hangu, Junliangcheng, Yangcun, Zhangguizhuang Airport, Jinghai, Yangliuqing and other key points. After twelve days and nights of marching and chasing operations, they surrounded Tianjin, cut off the connection between the 180,000 defenders of Tianjin and Tanggu, disrupted the enemy's defense system in the Tianjin-Tanggu defense zone in the water network area, and blocked the enemy's sea retreat route.

In just over ten days of marching and fighting, the Fourth Field Army crossed the Great Wall, entered the customs, and, together with the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, swept across the Beining and Ping-Sui lines and the hundreds of miles of front lines of Ping, Jin, Zhang, and Tang, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's strategic intention instructed at the beginning of the campaign: "The basic principle is to encircle but not attack (such as Zhangjiakou and Xinbaoan), and some are to isolate but not encircle (that is, only strategic encirclement, isolating the connection between the enemies, but not tactical encirclement, such as Ping, Jin, and Tongzhou), in order to annihilate the enemies individually after the deployment is completed." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, p. 1369). The size of our army's forces, the speed of its advance, the secrecy of its actions, and the strength of its combat effectiveness were completely beyond the enemy's expectations. After the end of the Liaoshen Campaign, Fu Zuoyi estimated that the main force of our Northeast Liberation Army would need at least three months to rest before entering the customs. Therefore, although he saw that the overall situation was unfavorable and North China was exposed, he still relied on his temporary advantage on the North China battlefield and sat and watched the situation. He did not expect that the main force of our Northeast Liberation Army would quickly enter the customs with lightning speed, and, together with the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, would attack from all directions at once, completely dividing and encircling his more than 500,000 troops into several sections. At this time, Fu Zuoyi's army completely became "turtles in a jar," shrinking into two isolated strongholds of Ping and Jin, falling into a completely passive position where they could not fight, could not defend, and had no way to escape. Our army could then calmly annihilate them one by one. This strategic situation laid the foundation for the victory of the Tianjin Campaign and the peaceful liberation of Beiping; it fully confirmed Chairman Mao's estimation of the enemy's situation at that time: "The enemy always underestimates the initiative of our army and overestimates its own strength, although they are also startled birds at the same time." "This kind of plan is beyond the enemy's expectations, and it is difficult for the enemy to detect it before you finally complete the deployment." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, p. 1370)

At that time, in addition to the enemy troops annihilated in the Ping-Sui and Ping-Jin peripheries, there were more than 200,000 people in Beiping, more than 130,000 people in Tianjin, and more than 50,000 people in Tanggu. Our army's strategic layout was originally to liberate Tanggu first. Because both Beiping and Tianjin are large cities with millions of people, in order to spare the ancient capital and millions of people from the destruction of war, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao began to prepare to first capture Tanggu, control the port, annihilate the small ones, isolate the big ones, make a model, and force the defenders of Ping and Jin to lay down their weapons. However, later, according to the reconnaissance of the terrain, the surrounding area of Tanggu was open, with many rivers and salt fields, and it did not freeze in winter, which was not conducive to building fortifications or deploying troops; at the same time, Tanggu's back was against the sea, and the defender Hou Jingru's headquarters was located on a warship. If Tanggu was attacked first, it would be difficult to annihilate all the defenders. At this time, the Ping and Jin defenders also expressed their unwillingness to accept the people's advice and attempted to resist stubbornly. If Tanggu was attacked first, it would prolong the time to liberate Ping and Jin and liberate the entire North China. Based on this situation, the Central Committee changed its original intention and decided to first attack and annihilate the enemy in Tianjin. This decision had a significant impact on the smooth development of the war situation later. This once again proved the flexibility of Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical guidance. Chairman Mao said in "Strategic Issues in China's Revolutionary War": "If the plan does not conform to the situation, or does not fully conform to the situation, it is necessary to form a new judgment and make a new determination according to the new understanding, and change the established plan to make it suitable for the new situation."

The Tianjin Campaign was a large-scale siege warfare in the water network area. Tianjin is surrounded by a vast coastal depression, a water network area that is easy to defend and difficult to attack, and there are many difficulties for large-scale multi-arms combat operations. The terrain in the urban area of Tianjin is complicated, and it is divided into many fragments by the Yongding River, Daqing River, Ziya River, Bai River, and Canal. Chen Changjie, the commander of the enemy army in Tianjin, vigorously expanded and repaired the city defense since the autumn of 1947. A moat 10 meters wide and 4-5 meters deep was dug around the city, and the water from the canal and the Haihe River was poured in, and the water depth was often maintained at about 3 meters. Inside the moat was connected to an earthen wall, with a height of 6-7 meters from the top of the wall to the bottom of the river. There was an electric network attached to the wall, and there was a bunker every 20-30 meters. Outside the moat, there were bunker groups, several barbed wire fences, electric networks, and deer villages, and tens of thousands of landmines were buried around it. The villages within five miles around the city were burned down to create a no-man's land. There were more than 380 large bunkers along the moat, and about 1,000 bunkers in the city and in depth. The deep bunker group went directly to the core fortification area. The bandit leader Chen Changjie boasted that it was "the fortress of Greater Tianjin." He believed that with such complicated terrain, solid fortifications, and more than 130,000 troops, he could completely defend it, so he still refused to surrender after being surrounded and continued to resist stubbornly.

Faced with such a military group with more than 100,000 people and solid defenses, it was indeed a major task to win the victory of the siege warfare. And the time to complete the task was very urgent, because Beiping had to be further liberated after Tianjin was captured. At that time, it was already early January 1949. If the time was delayed, the ice would melt, which would be unfavorable for the Beiping battle. Therefore, the preparation work for the Tianjin Campaign had to be completed within ten days.

At that time, our Fourth Field Army was in the process of continuous marching and fighting, and had not been in the customs for long. There were all kinds of difficulties in completing the task of attacking and annihilating the enemy in Tianjin in the shortest possible time. However, what we were carrying out was a people's war, a just war. We followed a series of policies and regulations for the people's war formulated by Chairman Mao. Our army had the correct strategic and tactical guidance and strong political work of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and received enthusiastic support from the broad masses of the people. The North China Party organization sent special personnel to the front-line headquarters to assist in the work. The people of North China were truly responsive to the People's Liberation Army's requests, and had everything that was needed. Therefore, no matter how great the difficulties were, they were overcome one by one.

First of all, in the operation of clearing the periphery, the people of North China and the local armed forces undertook the heavy tasks of helping to scout the terrain, restore traffic, send out guides, provide enemy information, and supply the troops. This ensured that our army smoothly eliminated the enemy in 18 outposts on the periphery from January 3 to 13 in just ten days, entered the attack preparation position, and completed the arduous task of preparing for the siege.

Chairman Mao told us: "Do not fight unprepared battles, do not fight uncertain battles." Therefore, to complete the task of capturing Tianjin, strengthening preparations was a major event.

In the preparations for the siege, the first difficulty encountered was how to break the enemy's water release plan. After our army surrounded Tianjin, the enemy connected the Nanyun River and the moat near Sanyuan Village, so that most of the water from the Nanyun River flowed into the moat. The waterways of the moat to the Haihe River were blocked near Zhaogezhuang and Chentangzhuang, so that the accumulated water could not flow into the Haihe River, but poured into the vast suburbs of southwest Tianjin, creating a flooded area. This greatly hindered our army's attack preparations. Our army mobilized the local people to come up with ideas and solutions, conducted investigations and studies on the river water, found the sluice gate of the Jianhe River near Duliu and Machang in the upper reaches of the Nanyun River, opened the sluice gate, and the water from the Nanyun River flowed into the Jianhe River, cutting off the water source of the Tianjin moat, and solving the problem of flooding in the attack on Tianjin.

After the large-scale flooding was lifted, how to break through the outer moat barrier was still an important difficulty in the breakthrough stage. The enemy attached great importance to the role of the moat, tried every means to increase the river water, and sent hundreds of people to break the ice on the river every day to prevent it from freezing. Our army mobilized the vast number of soldiers and the masses of the people to carry out military democracy, and everyone came up with ideas and methods to create a variety of river-crossing equipment suitable for the characteristics of this area, ensuring the victory of the breakthrough. For example, the reed bridge was one of the creations at that time. This kind of reed bridge was not only light and strong, but also had great buoyancy, and was not afraid of bullets. It was convenient to move under the enemy's fire, and it could be made from local materials. The local people sent more than 500 bundles of reeds in one night. This kind of reed bridge became the main equipment for overcoming the moat barrier at that time. In addition, double-ladder-style hinged bridges, turning ladders, boat bridges, cloud ladders, etc. were all made by the masses according to the specific fortification conditions at that time and in that place. These equipment played a great role in overcoming the difficulties of attacking Tianjin.

The North China Party organization, especially the comrades of the Tianjin underground party, provided detailed enemy information about Tianjin, and even the location, shape, and garrison strength of each bunker were specifically explained. This enabled our army to quickly grasp the situation, and thus the determination, the formulation of combat plans, and the deployment of troops all had a reliable and reliable basis.

In the Tianjin Campaign, our army made meticulous military deployments and siege preparations on the one hand, and carried out strong, lively, and active political work before, during, and after the war, giving play to a high degree of combat tenacity and vigorous attacking spirit, ensuring the victory of the operation. The soldiers' firm determination was further enhanced under the encouragement of the people of North China. The broad masses of the people showed unparalleled care and enthusiastic support for their army. Especially the people in the suburbs of Tianjin, due to the disasters of the Kuomintang bandit army's burning of villages and demolition of houses, had unparalleled hatred for the enemy army. In the pre-war mobilization, our army mobilized the masses to tell the soldiers about the suffering they had suffered, which greatly inspired the soldiers. "Capture Chen Changjie alive and avenge the Tianjin compatriots" became the soldiers' oath.

The North China Party organization also made full preparations for the work of taking over Tianjin. From the Tianjin Military Control Commission and party and government organs to the district and street organizational structure, personnel selection, and office locations, specific arrangements were made in advance. Before the end of the battle, places to live and food were prepared for 120,000 prisoners. Under the leadership of the Tianjin underground party, the workers and students of Tianjin carried out a resolute struggle to protect factories and schools, protecting various industrial and cultural equipment from enemy destruction.

All this ensured the smooth progress of the pre-war preparation, combat operations, and post-war work of the Tianjin Campaign. Without the help of the people of North China and the North China Party organization, it would have been impossible to quickly win the victory of the Tianjin Campaign. From this, we once again saw the greatness of the people's power, once again saw the victory of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war, the victory of the policy of encircling the cities from the countryside, the victory of our party's underground work in the cities, and the victory of our party's various urban policies.

In the preparation process of the Tianjin Campaign, the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army had issued a warning to the Tianjin defenders to lay down their weapons. When our army approached the city, the bandit leader Chen Changjie sent representatives of the Tianjin Council to negotiate out of the city twice in order to delay our army's actions and explore our army's intentions. The Tianjin Front Command, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Military Commission, proposed to the enemy that the Tianjin defenders should automatically lay down their weapons, and the People's Liberation Army guaranteed the safety of life and property of all officers and soldiers who automatically laid down their weapons. If they insisted on resisting, they would be severely punished on the day the city was broken, and the defenders were ordered to reply within 24 hours. However, the enemy had no sincerity in accepting the will of the people, and deliberately said that it would be difficult to lay down their weapons within 24 hours. This rejected our party's conditions for them to surrender. The enemy's delaying tactics were fully exposed, and our army immediately decided to annihilate the stubborn enemy and notified the defenders that our army would begin to attack the city at 10:00 a.m. the next day (14th). Before this, our army had also adopted this "courtesy first, then force" tactic in the Huailai and Kangzhuang battles, the Xinbaoan battle, and the Zhangjiakou battle.

Before launching the general offensive, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao instructed that the attacking troops should try their best to reduce the damage to factories and schools, and to various major buildings in Tianjin in the battle. This also fully demonstrated the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's concern for the life and property of the people. The commanders and fighters of the attacking troops resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions in the battle.

The enemy's defense deployment in Tianjin was as follows: the entire position was divided into three lines. The first line was the area north of Jintang Bridge, Jingang Bridge, and No. 21 Bridge, including Beiyang University; the second line was the area north of Haiguang Temple, Shengli Bridge, and Zhongzheng Bridge; and the third line was the area south of Shengli Bridge and Zhongzheng Bridge. The core fortification area was east of Haiguang Temple, north of the Xiangzi River, and south of Shengli Bridge. The Tianjin Defense Headquarters was in Haiguang Temple.

The shape of the urban area of Tianjin is 25 miles long from north to south and 10 miles wide from east to west. The enemy's strong troops, such as Chiang Kai-shek's direct line 62nd Army, were in the central and northern parts, and the weak troops were in the southern part. The tall buildings in Tianjin are in the southern part, the general bungalows are in the central part, the northern suburbs are open, and the southern part is mostly water network areas.

Our army's attack deployment on the urban area of Tianjin followed Chairman Mao's principle of "concentrating absolutely superior forces in each battle, encircling the enemy on all sides, striving to annihilate them completely, and not allowing any to escape." It was based on the characteristics of the enemy's defense and the terrain characteristics of the urban area of Tianjin, and the requirements to resolve the battle in the shortest possible time and minimize the damage to the city. Based on the above principles and requirements, the operational policy of advancing from east to west (the 38th and 39th Armies from west to east, the 44th and 45th Armies from east to west), cutting off the waist (meeting at Jintang Bridge or Jingang Bridge), first south and then north, first dividing and then encircling and annihilating, and eating meat first and then gnawing bones was determined. The main point of this policy was to first seek to connect east and west, in order to disrupt the enemy's defense system and cut off the waist. Because Tianjin is a city that is long from north to south and narrow from east to west, strengthening the attack forces on the east and west sides can quickly and reliably seek to connect. Cutting off the enemy's waist can disrupt the enemy's entire defense system and freely expand the troops to the two wings. This way, it will not feel that the front is narrow and the troops cannot be deployed, nor will it lead to the dispersion of troops. In addition to the four armies in the two main attack directions in the east and west, part of the troops assisted in the attack from south to north, and a small number of troops feigned an attack from north to south. In order to confuse the enemy, heavy artillery was used to test fire to the north of Tianjin, and the guard regiment of the Fourth Field Army headquarters was used to conduct a reconnaissance in force from the north, and the reconnaissance action was deliberately exposed to the enemy. In addition, the actions of our negotiators were used to deliberately create the illusion for the enemy that the siege headquarters was in the north. Based on the above situation, Chen Changjie mistakenly judged that the main attack direction of our army was in the north. Therefore, on the eve of our army's general attack, Chen Changjie transferred the strongest main force of the 151st Division, which was originally deployed in the city center, to the north. This greatly weakened the enemy's resistance ability in our main attack direction.

The general attack was launched on time at 10:00 a.m. on January 14, 1949. The troops used the tactical principles of "four fasts and one slow" and "one point, two sides, and three-three system" proposed by Comrade Lin Biao, and launched attacks simultaneously at eleven breakthrough points in the two main attack directions in the east and west and in the north and south auxiliary and feigned attack directions. Under the close coordination of artillery, armored soldiers, engineers, and other arms, only one hour of but extremely fierce fighting broke through the enemy's defense line in the two main attack directions in the east and west, among which the fighting in the Peace Gate breakthrough area in the west was the most intense. The other directions also successively broke through the enemy's defenses, forming multi-way interspersed divisions in the urban area. The enemy sent two planes to participate in the battle, but they were immediately shot down by our anti-aircraft artillery. After that, the enemy planes did not dare to approach the war zone again. Our army quickly overcame the obstacles of the moat. After breaking through the enemy's first line of defense, the enemy army in the city relied on solid fortifications to carry out stubborn resistance, and launched continuous counter-impacts on our army from all aspects in an attempt to stop our army from going deep. Our army gave play to a high degree of heroism and tenacity, and boldly and flexibly used the "four groups and one team" and the tactics of dividing and interspersing. When the vanguard troops encountered solid houses and strongholds, they only guarded them with small troops, and the main force bypassed them and continued to advance, interspersing through walls and over roofs, entering everywhere, fighting bravely alone, and advancing straight ahead. When the follow-up troops found that the troops in front were blocked by the enemy, they immediately opened up another road to advance. This quickly made the enemy's entire defense deployment a mess. This tactic of dividing and interspersing was commonly used in the Northeast. Fan Hanjie, the enemy's Northeast "Suppression General" deputy commander who was captured alive by our army in the Jinzhou Campaign, said: "We are most afraid of this tactic of dividing." In the Tianjin battle, our army once again exerted the power of this tactic. After sixteen hours of fierce fighting, at 2:00 a.m. on January 15, the main forces on the east and west sides met at Jintang Bridge, completing the main part of the combat plan. The enemy army then collapsed across the board. Our army boldly interspersed and pursued, and developed rapidly. At 8:00 a.m. on the 15th, they attacked into the core fortification area and occupied Haiguang Temple. At 10:00 a.m., the bandit leader Chen Changjie's defense headquarters raised a white flag, and the enemy completely collapsed. The enemy's main force, the 151st Division, which had been transferred to the north of the city by Chen Changjie due to a mistake, was completely surrounded and isolated, and later laid down its weapons without participating in the battle.

"The patriotic, just, and revolutionary nature of the People's Liberation Army's war is bound to win the support of the people of the whole country. This is the political foundation for defeating Chiang Kai-shek." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, p. 1246). The Tianjin Campaign not only fully demonstrated the characteristics of the people's war in the pre-war preparation work, but also showed everywhere the people's love for our army and a high degree of awareness and organization in the battle. After the battle began, the workers, students, and citizens of Tianjin, holding the banners and flags that had been prepared long ago to welcome the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, waited at home. After our army broke through the periphery, the workers and students of Tianjin poured out from all directions and courtyards to organize parades and demonstrations, and automatically acted as guides, searching for and arresting the enemy together with the soldiers. The troops fought in the front, and the citizens clapped and cheered in the back. Unable to suppress the hatred for the enemy, some people rushed in front of the troops bare-handed. Under the impact of this torrent of military and civilian cooperation, the defenders everywhere lost their souls and surrendered their weapons one after another. This enthusiastic scene of the military and the people closely combined together, fighting vigorously, and overwhelming the enemy, showed that the party's political propositions had grasped the broadest masses, and the masses had acted fearlessly to attack the enemy. This is the source of the invincible power of the people's army, and the manifestation of the victory of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war.

The people of Tianjin saw their own army for the first time, and they scrambled to have the soldiers live in their homes. In order to abide by the urban policies and mass discipline, the troops were willing to eat and sleep on the streets and under the eaves. The two sides pushed back and forth on this matter. Once the soldiers lived in the homes of the masses, the masses were even more enthusiastic to receive them. The soldiers could not even think of starting a fire to cook. The warm and harmonious atmosphere between the people and the people's army formed a new atmosphere that Tianjin had never had before.

In order to implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to protect the life and property of the people, our army conducted in-depth communication and education to the troops before the war, and put forward the slogan of "Comprehensive protection of the people's property, and all captured materials remain intact." In the course of the battle, our army paid attention to the protection of the city and the people's property everywhere, showing precise tactics and shooting skills. In the Nanshi District, the enemy stubbornly resisted relying on Yaohua Middle School. Our army managed to annihilate the enemy without destroying the school. There was an enemy artillery position in the courtyard of Nankai University, which fiercely blocked our attacking troops. Our artillery only counterattacked the enemy's artillery position and did not hit the buildings of Nankai University. The enemy's observation post was at the top of the Zhongyuan Company, the tallest building in Tianjin. Although it greatly hindered our actions, our army did not carry out destructive shooting. Due to the accuracy of our army's artillery fire and the infantry's skilled interspersing tactics, except for the damage to the China Textile Factory No. 3 due to the enemy's stubborn resistance, most of the remaining factories and schools remained intact under our army's planned combat plan. The soldiers did not violate the city's buildings and the people's property. All the materials captured from the enemy were left intact in their original places or were guarded by someone, or were labeled with the words "Captured by a certain regiment, a certain company." Some soldiers guarded the captured materials. Although they could not eat for several meals, they would rather starve themselves and not touch the cans, food, etc. they were guarding. Once the battle was over, no one fired a shot randomly, and order was immediately restored on the streets, demonstrating our army's spirit of strictly implementing the party's policies and observing mass discipline. With the assistance of workers, students, and citizens, the largest industrial and commercial city in North China was well protected. The workers of Tianjin not only effectively protected various industrial equipment from destruction, but also repaired various telecommunications and transportation equipment at the fastest speed. Within a few hours after the end of the battle, the radio station began broadcasting, telecommunications and transportation were smooth, and shops began to operate. The people were jubilant, and the Tianjin urban area presented a lively scene.

The Tianjin Campaign lasted only 29 hours from the start of the attack to the end of the battle. A total of 130,000 enemies were annihilated, and 1,163 artillery pieces, 3,553 light and heavy machine guns, 54,641 rifles, horses, and short guns, 879 vehicles, and various other ammunition materials were captured, and two enemy planes were shot down.

The victory of the Tianjin Campaign gave a strong warning and a clear direction to Fu Zuoyi, who attempted to defend Beiping, and other remaining Kuomintang troops in various places: all those who did not understand the general situation and were unwilling to obey the will of the people and attempted to resist stubbornly would only end up like the Tianjin Campaign. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army would have to solve them with the "Tianjin method." The "Tianjin method" was to use combat methods to completely solve the 130,000 Kuomintang troops defending the city. Chen Changjie, the commander of the Tianjin enemy defense and the commander of the garrison command, Lieutenant General Commander Chen Changjie, Lin Weichou, the Lieutenant General Commander of the 62nd Army and Deputy Commander of the Tianjin Defense, Liu Yunhan, the Lieutenant General Commander of the 86th Army, and Du Jianshi, the famous reactionary leader and puppet mayor of Tianjin, were all captured. They refused a peaceful settlement and insisted on resisting to the end, and received the punishment they deserved.

The "Tianjin method" taught Fu Zuoyi and other Kuomintang remnant forces a lesson. When the People's Liberation Army surrounded Pingjin and approached the city, Fu Zuoyi also sent representatives to negotiate with our army. However, at that time, he thought he still had strength and wanted to compete. However, after the Tianjin defenders were defeated and all 130,000 people were resolved within 29 hours, Chen Changjie, who was captured in Tianjin, met with the negotiating representatives sent by Beiping and relayed the taste of the Tianjin Campaign. Only then did General Fu Zuoyi truly realize the power of the people's army. The negotiations on the Beiping issue quickly reached an agreement, and more than 200,000 defenders accepted the peaceful conditions of leaving the city for reorganization, which resulted in the "Beiping method."

    回忆天津战役更好地学习毛泽东思想
    刘亚楼
    天津战役是中国人民解放战争中一次重要的攻坚战，是促使北平和平解放和解放全华北的关键。天津战役的胜利，是毛泽东同志人民战争思想和战略方针的胜利，是中国人民解放军在人民群众热烈支援下英勇作战的胜利，也是我党、政、军、民密切配合共同斗争的胜利。
    这一战役是在解放战争已经经历了两年半的时候进行的，是在我军已经由劣势转为优势，由防御转入全国规模进攻的历史时期进行的。
    1948年秋季，中国人民解放军已经停止了国民党军队的进攻，并使自己转入反攻，在各个战场上同时发动了大规模的秋季攻势。遵照党中央和毛主席英明的战略计划，东北人民解放军，在北起长春南到昌黎一千五百多里的战线上全线出击。只五十二天的时间，就歼敌近五十万人，解放了残留在敌手的十四座城市。到1948年11月2日解放沈阳为止，东北全境解放。不到三年的光景，蒋介石在东北战场上的一百万军队，包括“主力中之主力”的若干美械兵团在内，全军复没了。当时，毛主席对于辽沈战役结束后敌我力量变化的新形势曾经指出：“中国的军事形势现已进入一个新的转折点，即战争双方力量对比已经发生了根本的变化。人民解放军不但在质量上早已占有优势，而且在数量上现在也已经占有优势。这是中国革命的成功和中国和平的实现已经迫近的标志。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1363页）
    美蒋为挽救其全面败局，一面进行“和平”阴谋，“引退”蒋介石，抬出李宗仁，一面调整部署，企图重建江南防线。美帝国主义并且企图插足青岛、上海，以便使国民党军队取得喘息时间，保存国民党残余力量，继续与中国人民为敌。
    党中央和毛主席精辟地分析了当时的形势。指出敌人战略上的战线已经全部瓦解，我国阶级力量的对比已经发生了新的变化，革命怒潮正在激动着社会各个阶层。国民党反动统治已从根本上动摇，已到了分崩离析，人心尽弃的境地。这样的形势向中国人民提出了严重的问题：是要将革命进行到底，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地歼灭国民党反革命武装力量和一切反动势力，争取中国人民革命的彻底胜利呢？还是半途而废，在美帝国主义和国民党残余军事力量面前止步，使敌人赢得喘息机会，然后卷土重来？这是有关我国人民革命成败的重大问题。在这紧要关头，党中央和毛主席作出了将革命进行到底的英明决策。
    在东线和南线继睢杞战役、济南战役胜利之后，开始了有名的淮海战役。在北线紧接着辽沈战役的胜利，迅速组织了有名的平津战役；西北战场也进入反攻；敌后广泛深入地开展了游击战争。同时，针对美蒋“和平”阴谋，毛主席发表了关于时局的声明，提出八项和平谈判条件。中共中央负责人发表了“再有一年左右的时间，就可能将国民党反动政府从根本上打倒”的评论。公布了战犯名单和惩办战犯的政策，以及新解放区工作的一系列政策。正是由于党中央和毛主席的英明决策，坚定地掌稳了舵，才使中国革命沿着正确道路，胜利地进行到底。解放华北的战役就是在这样的战略方针指导下进行的。
    当时，国民党在华北还保留了四十多个师的五十余万军队，继续支撑局面，掩护江南的战略部署。被孤立于华北的傅作义，这时举棋不定：一面收缩兵力集结于平、津、张、塘一线，摆成一字长蛇阵，并且和我谈判，查探我军意图，以求自保；一面和蒋介石信使往还，想南逃江南靠拢蒋介石；又想西窜绥远。
    党中央和毛主席考虑到如果让傅作义的五十万军队南逃或西窜，都将对解放战争胜利的进程发生不利的影响。因此，决定刚刚结束辽沈战役、正在进行战役休整的东北解放军主力——第四野战军迅速进关，和人民解放军华北兵团会合，共同进行平津战役，首先将傅作义东西两面的退路切断，而后加以分割包围，“关起门来打狗”，以便彻底解决华北问题。
    在林彪、罗荣桓同志指挥下的第四野战军，坚决执行中央指示，克服了连续作战未及休整等各种困难，在辽沈战役刚结束二十天，即1948年11月22日，就开始了向关内进军。当时的意图是：和人民解放军华北兵团一起，首先抓住并消灭傅作义主力于平绥线，拖住蒋系部队于平津地区，求得在不长的时间内歼灭平、津、张一线全部守敌四十四个师。按照这个意图，第四野战军八十万大军和人民解放军华北兵团会合，分三路，齐头并进，日夜兼程开赴华北战场，充分表现了我军“勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1247页）。
    右路军从南从北夹击平绥线。连续十九昼夜的行军追击作战，攻克密云，占领怀来、康庄，解放了张家口。歼灭了傅作义主力暂编第三、第四两个军部、七个师和骑兵旅等六万五千人，打掉了傅作义起家的本钱，控制了由八达岭至张家口的平绥路全段，切断了傅作义西窜之路。
    中路军主力向天津、北平间攻击前进。八天的行军作战，歼敌五千余人。进逼北平城下，夺取了丰台战略物资基地和石景山发电厂，并一度攻入德胜门，完成了对北平守敌的包围。完全切断了平、津守敌的联系。
    当时的情况，“唯一的或主要的是怕敌人从海上逃跑”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1370页）。左路军入关后，主力沿北宁线急进。连克唐山、芦台、汉沽、军粮城、杨村、张贵庄机场、静海、杨柳青等要点。经十二昼夜的行军追歼作战，包围了天津，切断了天津、塘沽两地十八万守敌的联系，在水网地区打乱了敌人津、塘守备区防御体系，封闭了敌人的海上退路。
    第四野战军在短短十余天的行军作战中，跨过长城，入关后，和人民解放军华北兵团共同席卷了北宁、平绥两干线和平、津、张、塘几百里战线，坚决执行了毛主席所指示的在战役初期“基本原则是围而不打（例如对张家口、新保安），有些则是隔而不围（即只作战略包围，隔断诸敌联系，而不作战役包围，例如对平、津、通州），以待部署完成之后各个歼敌。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1369页）的战略意图。我军兵力之大，前进之快，行动之秘密，战斗力之强大，完全出于敌人的意料之外。在辽沈战役结束后，傅作义曾估计我东北解放军的主力至少要休整三个月才能进关。所以，虽然看到全局不利，华北暴露，但仍依靠其在华北战场的暂时优势，坐观时局。想不到我东北解放军主力以神速动作，迅即挥师入关，和人民解放军华北兵团一起，一下子就从四面八方打来，将他的五十多万军队完全分割包围，截成几段。傅作义的军队这时完全成了“瓮中之鳖”，蜷缩于平、津两个孤立据点之内，陷入欲战不得，欲守不能，欲逃无路，完全被动的地位。而我军则可以从容地将其逐一加以歼灭。这一战略形势为天津战役的胜利和北平的和平解放奠定了基础；完全证实了毛主席当时所作的敌情估计：“敌人对于我军的积极性总是估计不足的，对于自己力量总是估计过高，虽然他们同时又是惊弓之鸟。”“此种计划，出敌意外，在你们最后完成部署以前，敌人是很难觉察出来的。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1370页）
    当时，敌军除在平绥和平、津外围被歼的以外，在北平还有二十多万人，在天津有十三万多人，在塘沽有五万多人。我军的战略布局，原来是首先解放塘沽。因为北平、天津都是几百万人口的大城市，党中央和毛主席为了使古都名城和几百万人民免遭战争破坏，开始准备先打下塘沽，控制海口，歼灭小的，孤立大的，作出个样子，迫使平、津守敌放下武器。但是，后来根据对地形的侦察，塘沽附近四周开阔，河流、盐田很多，而且冬不结冰，既不便于构筑工事，又不便于展开兵力；同时塘沽背面靠海，守敌侯镜如的指挥部设在军舰上，如果首先攻击塘沽，难以把守敌全部歼灭。这时平、津守敌又表示不愿接受人民劝告，企图顽抗。如果首先攻击塘沽，就将拖长解放平、津和解放全华北的时间。根据这一情况，中央改变原来意图，决定首先攻歼天津之敌。这一决定，对于后来战局的顺利发展，有着重大的意义。再次证明了毛主席战略、战役指导的灵活性。毛主席在《中国革命战争的战略问题》中说：“如果计划和情况不符合，或者不完全符合，就必须依照新的认识，构成新的判断，定下新的决心，把已定计划加以改变，使之适合于新的情况。”
    天津战役是一个在水网地区大规模的攻坚战。天津周围是广阔绵垠的沿海洼地，是易守难攻的水网地带，对大兵团多兵种的战斗行动有不少困难。天津市区地形复杂，被永定河、大清河、子牙河、白河和运河切成许多片断。天津敌军防守司令陈长捷从1947年秋就大力增修城防。环绕全市挖了一道宽十米，深四、五米的护城河，并放进运河河水和海河潮水，水深经常保持三米左右。护城河内侧连接一道土墙，墙顶到河底高六、七米，墙上附有电网，每隔二十至三十米有一座碉堡。护城河外有碉堡群，有几道铁丝网、电网和鹿砦，周围有埋设数以万计的地雷，并且将城周围五里以内的村庄焚毁，造成一片无人区。沿着护城河有大型碉堡三百八十多个，连同市内和纵深的碉堡共约一千多个。纵深的地堡群直达核心工事区，匪首陈长捷自夸为“大天津堡垒化”。他以为凭借着这样的复杂地形、坚固工事和十三万多兵力，完全可以固守，所以被围以后仍然拒绝投降，继续顽抗。
    面对这样一个有着十几万人、坚固设防的军事集团，要取得攻坚战的胜利，确是一个重大的任务。而完成任务的时间又很急迫，因为天津攻克以后还要进一步解放北平。那时已经是1949年1月初，如果时间推迟，冰冻融解，就不利于北平的作战，因而天津战役的准备工作，必须在十天以内完成。
    当时我第四野战军正处在连续行军作战之后，进关不久，人地两生，要在最短时间内，完成攻歼天津守敌的任务，是有着种种困难的。但是，我们进行的是人民战争、正义战争。我们遵循毛主席所制定的人民战争的一系列的政策和规定。我军有着党中央和毛主席正确的战略战术指导和坚强的政治工作，获得了广大人民的热烈支援。华北党组织派了专人到前线司令部协助进行工作，华北人民对解放军真是有求必应，应有尽有。因而困难再大，也一一被克服了。
    首先是在扫清外围的作战中，华北人民和地方武装担负了帮助侦察地形、恢复交通、派出向导、供给敌情资料，以及部队供应等等繁重的工作。保证了我军从1月3日到13日短短的十天之内顺利地肃清了外围十八个据点的敌人，进入攻击准备位置，完成了艰巨的攻城准备工作。
    毛主席告诉我们：“不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗”。因此，要完成攻克天津的任务，加强准备是一件大事。
    攻城准备中，首先遭到的困难是如何打破敌人的放水计划。我军包围天津之后，敌人在三元村附近将南运河与护城河沟通，使南运河河水大部流入护城河。并在赵各庄、陈塘庄附近堵塞了护城河通海河的水道，使积水不能流入海河，而向天津西南部广大郊区倾泻，造成了一片水淹区。这就大大妨碍了我军的攻击准备。我军发动当地人民群众出主意想办法，对河水进行了调查研究，在南运河上游独流和马厂附近找到了碱河的水闸，把水闸提开，南运河河水流入碱河，切断了天津护城河的水源，解决了攻击天津的水患问题。
    大面积水患解除以后，如何突破外围护城河障碍，仍是突破阶段的重要困难。敌人非常重视护城河的作用，千方百计增加河水，并且每日以数百人在河上打冰以防结冻。我军发动广大战士和人民群众开展军事民主，大家出主意想办法，创造了多种适合这个地区特点的渡河器材，保证了突破的胜利。如苇子桥就是当时的创造之一。这种苇子桥不但轻便结实，浮力大，而且不怕枪弹，在敌人火力下运动方便，又可以就地取材。当地群众在一个晚上就送来芦苇五百多捆。这种苇子桥成为当时克服护城河障碍的主要器材。此外，像双梯式的活叶桥、翻梯、船桥、云梯等，都是群众根据当时当地的具体工事情况制作出来的。这些器材对克服攻击天津作战的困难有很大作用。
    华北党组织特别是天津市地下党的同志，供给了详尽的天津敌情资料，连每一座碉堡的位置、形状、守备兵力都有具体交代。这就使我军迅速掌握了情况，因而下决心、订作战计划、部署兵力，都有了确实可靠的基础。
    天津战役中，我军一方面作了周密的军事部署和攻坚准备，一方面在战前、战中和战后进行了强有力的、生动活跃的政治工作，发挥了高度的战斗顽强性和旺盛的攻击精神，保证了作战的胜利。战士们的坚强决心在华北人民的激励之下更加高涨。广大群众对自己军队表现了无比的关怀和热烈的支援。尤其天津近郊人民，由于遭受国民党匪军焚村拆房等等灾害，对敌军有着无比的愤恨。我军在战前动员中发动群众向战士诉说所受的苦痛，极大地激励了战士们。“活捉陈长捷，替天津同胞报仇除害”，成为战士们的誓言。
    对天津市的接收工作，华北党组织也进行了充分的准备。从天津市军管会和党政机关到区的、街道的一套组织机构、人选、办公地点，都预先作了具体安排。战斗结束前，就准备好了十二万俘虏住的地方和吃的东西。天津市的工人、学生，在天津市地下党的领导下进行了坚决的护厂、护校斗争，保护了各种工业、文化设备不受敌人破坏。
    这一切就保证了天津战役的战前准备、战斗行动和战后工作顺利进行。没有华北人民和华北党组织的帮助，天津战役的迅速取得胜利是不可能的。我们从这里再一次看到了人民力量的伟大，再一次看到了党中央和毛主席人民战争思想的胜利，乡村包围城市政策的胜利，我党在城市中地下工作的胜利和我党各项城市政策的胜利。
    在天津战役的准备过程中，人民解放军总部曾向天津守敌发出放下武器的劝告。当我军兵临城下时，匪首陈长捷为了迟滞我军的行动，并查探我军意图，曾两次派出当时的天津参议会的代表出城谈判。天津前线司令部遵照中央军委的指示，向敌人提出了天津守军应该自动放下武器，人民解放军保证一切自动放下武器的官兵生命财产的安全，如果坚持抵抗，城破之日将要加重惩罚等条件，并且限令守军在二十四小时以内答复。但是，敌人并无接受人民意志的诚意，故意说在二十四小时以内放下武器有困难。这就拒绝了我方令其投降的条件，敌人缓兵之计，已完全暴露，我军当即决定歼灭顽抗之敌，并且通知守军，我军将于第二天（14日）上午十时开始攻城。在这以前的怀来和康庄战斗、新保安战斗以及张家口战斗，我军也都采取过这种“先礼后兵”的战法。
    在发起总攻以前，党中央和毛主席曾指示，攻城部队在战斗中要尽量设法使工厂和学校，使天津市各种主要建筑，少受炮火和炸药的破坏。这也充分说明了党中央和毛主席对人民生命财产的关心。攻城部队指战员在战斗中坚决贯彻执行了毛主席的指示。
    敌人在天津的防御部署是这样的：整个阵地分为三线，第一线是金汤桥、金钢桥、二十一号桥以北地区，包括北洋大学；第二线是海光寺、胜利桥、中正桥以北地区；第三线是胜利桥、中正桥以南地区。核心工事区在海光寺以东，墙子河以北，胜利桥以南地区。天津防守司令部在海光寺。
    天津市区的形状是南北长二十五华里，东西宽十华里。敌人强的部队如蒋介石嫡系六十二军在中部和北部，弱的部队在南部。天津市高大建筑物在南部，一般平房在中部，市郊北部开阔，南部多为水网区。
    我军对天津市区的攻击部署，是遵照着毛主席“每战集中绝对优势兵力，四面包围敌人，力求全歼，不使漏网”的原则，根据敌人守备的特点和天津市区地形特点，根据力求在最短时间内解决战斗并尽量使城市少遭破坏的要求而制定的。根据以上原则和要求，确定了东西对进（三八、三九两军由西向东，四四、四五两军由东向西），拦腰斩断（在金汤桥或金钢桥会师），先南后北，先分割后围歼，先吃肉后啃骨头的作战方针。这个方针的要点是首先求得东西贯通，以打乱敌人的防御体系，拦腰斩断。由于天津是一个南北长，东西窄的城市，加强东西两面的攻击力量，就能迅速可靠地求得贯通。把敌人拦腰斩断，就能打乱敌人的整个防御体系，又能自由地将兵力向两翼扩展，这样既不感到正面狭窄，兵力摆不开，也不致形成兵力分散。除了东西两个主攻方向四个军以外，以部分兵力由南向北助攻和以小部兵力由北向南佯攻。为了迷惑敌人，曾使用重炮向天津北部进行试射，还利用第四野战军总部警卫团从北面进行威力侦察，并将侦察行动故意暴露给敌人。此外，还利用我方谈判人员的行动，有意给敌人制造了攻城指挥部在北面的错觉。陈长捷根据上述情况，错误地判断了我军主攻方向在北面。因此，在我军总攻前夜，陈长捷曾将其原来部署在市中心区的守城部队中最强的主力一五一师调到北面。这样大大减弱了我主攻方向上敌人的抵抗能力。
    总攻击是1949年1月14日十时准时开始的。各部队运用林彪同志提出的“四快一慢”，“一点两面三三制”（注）的战术原则，在东西两个主攻方向及南北各助攻、佯攻方向，共十一个突破口同时展开攻击。在炮兵、装甲兵、工兵等多兵种密切协同下，只以一个小时的但又是极为剧烈的战斗，东西两个主攻方向就都突破了敌人的防线，其中以西面和平门突破地区战斗最为激烈。其余方向也相继突破敌人的防御，对市区形成多路穿插分割。敌人曾派飞机两架参战，但当即被我高射炮兵击落。以后，敌机就没有再敢接近战区。我军迅速克服了护城河的障碍，突破了敌人第一道防线后，市内敌军依靠坚固工事进行顽强抵抗，从各个方面对我进行连续的反冲击，企图阻止我军深入。我军发扬了高度英勇顽强的战斗作风，大胆灵活地运用了“四组一队”、分割穿插战术。先头部队遇到坚固房屋和据点的时候，只拿小部队看管起来，主力绕过继续前进，分段穿墙越顶，无孔不入，孤胆作战，直插猛进。后续部队发现前边部队被敌阻住，立即另行打开道路前进。这样就很快把敌人整个防御部署搞得稀烂。这种分割穿插战术在东北曾普遍采用。锦州战役被我生俘的敌东北“剿总”上将副总司令范汉杰曾说：“我们最怕的就是这种分割战术”。天津战斗中我军再次发挥了这一战术的威力。经过十六小时的剧烈战斗，1月15日二时，东西两面主力在金汤桥会师，完成了作战计划的主要部分。敌军随之全线动摇瓦解。我军大胆穿插追扑，迅速发展。15日上午八时攻入核心工事区，占领海光寺。十时匪首陈长捷的防守司令部插上了白旗，敌人全部瓦解。因陈长捷发生错觉而调到城北部的敌军主力一五一师，被完全包围孤立，后来没有投入战斗就放下了武器。
    “人民解放军的战争所具有的爱国的正义的革命的性质，必然要获得全国人民的拥护。这就是战胜蒋介石的政治基础。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1246页）天津战役，不仅在战前的准备工作中充分表现了人民战争的特色，就是在战斗中也到处看出人民群众对我军的热爱以及高度的觉悟和组织程度。战斗开始以后，天津的工人、学生、市民手持早已准备好了的欢迎中国共产党和人民解放军的标语、旗帜，守候在家门。在我军突破外围以后，天津市工人和学生就从四面八方各个院落内拥出来组织游行示威，自动当向导，和战士一起搜捕敌人。部队在前面打仗，市民在后面拍掌欢呼。由于压制不住对敌人的愤恨心情，有的群众赤手空拳就跑在部队前面。就在这种军民协力汇成巨流的冲击下，各处守敌丧魂失魄，纷纷放下武器。这种军民紧密结合在一起，斗志昂扬，压倒敌人的热烈场面，说明党的政治主张已经掌握了最广大的群众，人民群众已经无所畏惧地行动起来向敌人冲击。这是人民军队不可战胜的力量的源泉，是毛主席人民战争思想胜利的表现。
    天津市人民第一次见到自己的军队，争先恐后地要战士们住到自己的家里去；部队为遵守城市政策和群众纪律，却情愿食宿在街头檐下，双方为此推让不已。一旦战士住到群众家中，群众更是热情接待，战士休想自己起火做饭。人民和人民军队之间热情和融洽的空气形成了天津从来没有过的新气象。
    我军为执行党中央和毛主席保护人民生命财产的指示，战前就向部队进行了深入的传达教育，提出“人民财产全面保护，缴获物资原封不动”的口号。在战斗过程中我军处处注意对城市和人民财产的保护，表现了精确战术和射击技巧。在南市区，敌军曾依靠耀华中学进行顽抗，我军作到了歼灭敌人而未破坏学校；南开大学院内有敌人的炮兵阵地，对我攻击部队实施猛烈阻击，我炮兵只还击敌人的炮兵阵地，不打南开大学的校舍；敌人的观察所在天津最高的建筑物中原公司的顶部，虽然对我行动妨害很大，但我军没有进行摧毁射击。由于我军炮火的准确和步兵熟练的穿插战术，在战斗中除了中纺三厂由于敌军顽抗有所损坏外，其余的工厂、学校大部都在我军预定的作战计划下保持了完整无损。战士们对城市建筑和人民财物秋毫无犯，所有缴获敌人的物资都原封不动地留在原地或者派人看守，或者贴上“某团、某连缴获”的字条。有的战士看守缴获物资，虽然几顿吃不上饭，但宁愿自己挨饿，对所看守的罐头、食品等也不动分毫。战斗一结束，没有人乱放一枪，街上立即恢复了秩序，表现了我军严格执行党的政策和遵守群众纪律的精神。在工人、学生和市民的协助下，很好地保护了这座华北最大的工商业城市。天津市的工人不仅有力地保护了各种工业设备免遭破坏，并且以最快的速度修复了各种电讯交通设备。战斗结束后几小时之内，广播电台就开始广播，电讯交通畅通，商店开始营业，人民欢欣鼓舞，天津市区呈现了一片热闹景象。
    天津战役从攻击开始到战斗结束历时只二十九小时。计歼敌十三万人，缴获各种炮一千一百六十三门，轻重机枪三千五百五十三挺，步马短枪五万四千六百四十一支，汽车八百七十九辆和其他各种弹药物资，并击落敌机两架。
    天津战役的胜利，给企图固守北平的傅作义以及其他各地残留的国民党军队提出了有力的警告和明显的去向：一切不明大义不愿服从人民意志，企图负隅顽抗的人们都只有天津战役的下场，中国人民和中国人民解放军对他们就只好用“天津方式”加以解决。“天津方式”就是用战斗的方法，将十三万国民党守城的军队全部解决。天津敌防守司令兼警备司令中将司令官陈长捷、六十二军中将军长兼天津防守副司令林伟俦、八十六军中将军长刘云瀚和著名的反动头子天津市伪市长杜建时等匪首一齐被俘。他们拒绝和平解决，坚持抵抗到底，受到了应得的惩罚。
    “天津方式”教训了傅作义，也教训了其他国民党残余力量。当着人民解放军包围了平、津，兵临城下的时候，傅作义也曾派出代表与我军进行谈判。但是，那时他认为自己还有力量，还想较量一下。可是，在天津守敌被打败，十三万人在二十九个小时之内全部被解决后，在天津被俘的陈长捷和由北平派出的谈判代表见了面，转告了天津战役的滋味之后，傅作义将军才真正认识到人民军队的力量，北平问题的谈判才很快达成协议，二十余万守军接受了出城改编的和平条件，从而又产生了“北平方式”。“这是在敌军主力被消灭以后必然地要出现的，是不可避免的”。“这种方法是一种斗争方式，是一种不流血的斗争方式，并不是不用斗争可以解决问题的”。（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1425、1426页）1月27日，国民党中央社发表伪南京政府国防部的文告称：“华北方面，为了缩短战争，获致和平，借以保全北平故都基础与文物古迹，傅总司令作义曾于22日发表文告，宣布自22日上午十时起休战。……共军已有小部开进市区。绥远、大同两地也将实施休战。”新华社当时对这个文告的评论是：“战败了，一切希望都没有了，比较好的一条出路，是军队离城改编，让人民解放军和人民政府和平地接收城防和市政，这是北平问题和平解决的基本原因。为什么天津不肯这样做呢？难道天津的工业商业‘基础与文物古迹’不应当保全吗？难道天津的‘国家元气’应当受损伤吗？为什么1月22日应当‘促成全国彻底和平之早日实现’，而在1月13日就不应当，而令天津的和平解决不能实现呢？基本的原因是天津打败了，……北平孤立了，毫无希望了，决心走第二条路，和平解决北平问题的可能性从此产生。”真正是：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。……扫帚到了，政治影响才能充分发生效力。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1131、1132页）
    淮海战役的胜利，平津的解放，华北问题的迅速解决，就使得第四野战军和华北野战军得以集中主力向南进军，协同全国各野战军促使全国革命早日胜利。中共中央对平津解放的贺电中说：“华北人民解放战争的伟大胜利，连同东北、华东、中原、西北人民解放战争的伟大胜利……已经奠定了人民解放斗争在全国胜利的巩固基础。国民党反动政府无论在军事上、政治上和经济上都已经陷于四分五裂动摇崩溃的绝境，除了彻底接受中国共产党所提出、而为全国人民所拥护的八项和平条件，按照人民的意志和北平的范例实现真正的民主的和平以外，它就将彻底地被歼灭。”
    天津战役的胜利是党、政、军、民合力斗争的胜利，是党中央和毛主席的正确领导和各项政策的胜利，是毛主席的人民战争思想的胜利。在我国社会主义建设已经获得伟大胜利的今天和《毛泽东选集》第四卷出版的时候，来回忆天津战役，使我们更加感到毛主席当时的作战指导方针的英明、正确和格外亲切，更加感到毛泽东思想的英明、伟大。我们必须更好地学习毛泽东同志的人民战争思想，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，埋头苦干，发愤图强，加速祖国的社会主义建设，把英勇的人民解放军建设成一支具有更高的政治觉悟和现代化作战能力的优良的革命军队。如果帝国主义胆敢将战争强加在中国人民头上，那么，我们一定会像过去摧毁国民党反动统治一样，以人民战争的思想武器，全民动员，彻底地消灭帝国主义侵略者，奠定世界的永久和平。
    注：“四快一慢”，“一点两面三三制”是林彪同志在解放战争中提出的战术原则。
    “四快一慢”是指每次作战必须力求准备充分，既要迅速抓住敌人积极行动，又不要莽撞从事。不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗。根据这一精神，具体规定了四快一慢的原则。
    “四快”是：1、向敌前进要快；
    2、攻击准备要快；
    3、突破扩张战果要快；
    4、追击要快。
    “一慢”是指确定总攻击发起的时机。就是说一定要在一切准备好了的情况下，才发起攻击，如果尚未准备就绪，则宁可慢一些，使部队有充裕时间作好充分准备。
    “一点两面”是指在向敌人进攻的时候，必须集中优势兵力，选择敌人弱点，从一点突破进去，在敌人内部
  “开花”，而不是分散兵力，到处突击；同时以一部分兵力从另外方向攻击，形成两面、三面或四面包围，以便促成主攻的突破，保证全歼敌人。
    “三三制”是步兵基层的战术组织形式。通常是一个班分三（或四）小组，每组三、四人。这样便于班长掌握和指挥，有利于部队进行小群的灵活动作和互相掩护，也有利于在敌火力下减少伤亡。
