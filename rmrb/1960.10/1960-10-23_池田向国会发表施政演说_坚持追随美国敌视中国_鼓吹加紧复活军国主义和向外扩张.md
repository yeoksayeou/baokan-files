Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda delivered his first policy speech since taking office at the extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet today. This policy speech demonstrates that the Japanese government intends to persist in implementing a traitorous policy of subservience to the United States, hostility towards China, and active execution of the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. It also indicated its intention to accelerate the development of militarist forces, implement predatory economic policies, strengthen fascist repression internally, and intensify economic expansion externally.

Ikeda Hayato said that his government "will adhere to the basic position of a free and democratic nation." He said that since his cabinet took office, it has "strived to improve Japan's relations with the United States," and will continue to "further consolidate" the "cooperative relationship" between the two countries, so as to make the "friendly" relations with the United States (i.e., Japan's dependence on the United States) "increasingly strengthened."

Ikeda stated that his government "firmly will not adopt a policy of neutralism," but will follow the United States' policies of aggression and war. He said that Japan's security "depends on the United Nations and the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty," and his government will "adhere to the existing security system." Ikeda also viciously slandered the legitimate demands of the Japanese people for a policy of neutrality as "an illusion."

In order to fulfill the obligations of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, Ikeda stated that he would further expand armaments and prepare for war. He said that "autonomously strengthening self-defense capabilities" is "something that should be determined to be done," therefore, Japan's militarist forces must be "gradually enhanced." He also indicated that he would amend the constitution that prohibits Japan from participating in war and maintaining combat forces when public opinion conditions "mature."

Ikeda also stated that he would "improve" Japan's relations with the South Korean puppet clique in order to create conditions for the establishment of an aggressive Northeast Asian bloc planned by the United States.

Regarding Japan's relations with socialist countries, Ikeda said: "Even towards communist countries, we want to make every effort to promote friendly relations as much as possible." Regarding Japan-China relations, the Ikeda government inherited the old policies of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, which were hostile to China and refused to recognize China. Although Ikeda also said that he "hopes" to "gradually improve" relations with "mainland China" and "welcomes" the "restoration of the atmosphere" in Japan-China trade that was "in a state of severance in the past," he made no mention of the three political principles and three trade principles for Japan-China relations put forward by the Chinese government.

Ikeda's policy speech shows that the Japanese ruling class will intensify its foreign expansion in the future. Ikeda said that "economic and technical assistance" to "underdeveloped" countries and regions "has become an extremely important issue." He stated that his government "will make even greater efforts in the future" to carry out economic expansion in these countries.

When talking about domestic issues, Ikeda, under the pretext of "eliminating violence," stated that he would strengthen the suppression of the patriotic and just struggles of the Japanese people. He said that "regardless of left or right, whether individual or collective 'violence,' it must be eliminated," and that he would "earnestly deal with" issues related to "maintaining social order."

In order to conceal his economic policies, which serve the monopoly capital more actively than previous cabinets, Ikeda also boasted about achieving a plan to "double national income within ten years" and make production "grow at an average rate of 9% per year." Ikeda stated that he would "take epoch-making measures" to plunder farmers' land in large quantities, so that the rural fishing population would "automatically" transfer to large monopoly capital enterprises and serve as cheap labor.

Ikeda also stated that he would "rectify" the education system to revive militarist education.

Based on the policy direction of Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda, Japanese Foreign Minister Zentaro Kosaka, Finance Minister Mikio Mizuta, and Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency Hisatsune Sakomizu delivered speeches on foreign affairs, finance, and economics respectively at today's Diet session.

Opposition party members will question Ikeda and others on their policy speeches.

    池田向国会发表施政演说
    坚持追随美国敌视中国
    鼓吹加紧复活军国主义和向外扩张
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本首相池田勇人今天在日本国会临时会议上发表他上台以后的第一次施政演说。这个施政演说表明，日本政府要坚持实行屈从美国、敌视中国、积极执行侵略性的日美军事同盟条约的卖国政策；并且表示要加速发展军国主义势力，实行掠夺性的经济政策，和对内加强法西斯镇压，对外加强经济扩张。
    池田勇人说：他的政府“将坚持作为一个自由民主国家的基本立场”。他说：他的内阁自从上台以来“努力地改善了日本同美国的关系”，今后还要“进一步巩固”两国的“合作关系”，以便使同美国的“友好”关系（即日本对美国的从属性）“愈益加强”。
    池田表示，他的政府“坚决不采取中立主义”政策，而要追随美国的侵略和战争政策。他说：日本的安全“要依赖联合国和日美安全条约”，他的政府要“坚持现行的安全体制”。池田并且恶毒地诬蔑日本人民要求实行中立政策的正当主张是“一种幻想”。
    为了履行日美军事同盟条约的义务，池田表示要进一步扩军备战。他说：“自主地充实自卫力量”是“应该下定决心去作的”，因此，要“逐渐增强”日本的军国主义势力。他并且表示，要在舆论条件“成熟”的时候修改禁止日本参战和保有作战力量的宪法。
    池田还表示要“改善”日本同南朝鲜傀儡集团的关系，以便为建立美国策划的东北亚侵略集团创造条件。
    关于日本同社会主义国家的关系，池田说：“即使对共产主义国家，也想尽可能努力增进友好关系”。关于日中关系，池田政府继承了岸信介内阁敌视中国、不承认中国的老政策。池田虽然也说什么“希望”同“中国大陆”的关系“逐渐加以改善”，“欢迎”过去“处于断绝状态的日中贸易呈现了恢复的气氛”；但是他对于中国政府方面提出的日中关系政治三原则和贸易三原则却只字未提。
    池田的施政演说显示，日本统治阶级今后将加紧进行对外扩张。池田说：对“不发达”国家和地区的“经济和技术援助已经成为极重要的问题了”。他表示，他的政府“今后还将作出更大的努力”来对这些国家进行经济扩张。
    谈到内政问题时，池田假借“排除暴力”的名义，表示要加强镇压日本人民的爱国正义斗争。他说什么“不问左右、不管是个人还是集体的‘暴力’，都必须加以排除”，要“认真地处理”有关“维持社会秩序”的问题。
    为了掩饰他比历届内阁都更积极地为垄断资本服务的经济政策，池田还吹嘘要实现“十年内国民收入增加一倍”和使生产“每年平均增长9％”的计划。池田表示要“采取划时代的措施”，大量掠夺农民的土地，以便使农村渔业人口“自动地”转移到垄断资本的大企业中，充作廉价劳动力。
    池田还表示要“整顿”教育制度，来复活军国主义教育。
    根据日本首相池田勇人的施政方针，日本外务相小坂善太郎、藏相水田三喜男，经济企划厅长官迫水久常在今天的国会会议上分别发表了外交、财政和经济演说。
    在野党议员将对池田等人的施政演说提出质询。
