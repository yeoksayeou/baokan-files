    Stripping Off the Mask of the U.S. Military
    Major General Zhong Xidong
    On the morning of October 1, 1945, five U.S. warships suddenly sailed into the Yantai sea. Their arrival was like a dark cloud obscuring the clear sky, and the people's joyful hearts due to liberation became tense.

    This so-called "ally" was never seen during the long War of Resistance against Japan. Now that the War of Resistance against Japan has been won and Yantai has been liberated, they have come. What are they here for?

    According to Rear Admiral Settel, the commander of this fleet, they were here to inspect the situation of Japan's surrender and the property of American nationals in Yantai. But when they learned that the Japanese puppet troops in Yantai had been wiped out and driven away by the Eighth Route Army a month ago, they should have sailed away immediately. However, under the guise of "liaising with our military and political authorities to establish friendly relations," they shamelessly refused to leave immediately. Moreover, while they were supposedly inspecting the property of American nationals, they repeatedly and shamelessly insisted on breaking into the military restricted area around our East Fort, and even attempted to force their way into our military barracks. They requested permission for their sailors to rest and play on Kongtong Island. With the approval of higher authorities, we agreed and sent some people to work as hosts to celebrate with the American sailors. Who knew they would never come again after that one time? It was later learned that they were afraid we would "redden" their sailors. After the American fleet visited, large formations of American air force and naval aircraft circled over our military restricted areas one after another. Our army made a solemn protest to Rear Admiral Settel about this. Settel said, "This is a celebration, celebrating your army's liberation of Yantai." And said, "If your army does not welcome it, I guarantee that there will be no similar actions in the future." Despite Rear Admiral Settel's guarantee, American planes continued to operate in our airspace. When we sternly warned that such behavior could not be tolerated and that he would be responsible for the consequences, he said, "We must especially cherish the friendship between our two countries."

    Their actions gave us reason to be wary of their ill intentions. Under these circumstances, according to the instructions of the Jiaodong District Party Committee and the Jiaodong Military Region, the Party, government, army, and people of Yantai formed a unified action committee to deal with sudden incidents. I was assigned as the secretary of this committee.

    I

    As expected, the mask of the U.S. military was quickly torn off by themselves. On October 4, the adjutant of the U.S. warship delivered an "ultimatum" demanding that our army withdraw from Yantai and hand over to them. We immediately lodged a serious protest. The adjutant stated that he would forward our protest to their superiors.

    On October 6, at dawn, a large number of U.S. warships sailed into Yantai Port and immediately dropped anchor. A small boat docked at the pier, and the person who came ashore asked Comrade Yu Guying (special envoy) to go to the U.S. warship for negotiations.

    Around nine o'clock, Comrade Yu Guying returned and briefly recounted his experience on the U.S. warship and introduced the situation of the U.S. military. This fleet was the Yellow Sea Fleet of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, carrying amphibious combat troops. The naval commander was Vice Admiral Barbey, and the amphibious operations commander was Major General Roc. They came here to transport amphibious combat troops to land in Yantai and asked our army to hand over, or at least jointly garrison with our army. According to them: at ten o'clock, their commander would come to our foreign affairs office to discuss the division of defense zones and the landing site and time with our garrison authorities. This is a blatant act of aggression! Everyone was very angry. We immediately analyzed the situation and decided on a countermeasure. After research, it was unanimously believed that this action by the U.S. military was a kind of blackmail and deception under the banner of "allies," attempting to intimidate us with superior military strength in order to achieve the goal of obtaining Yantai without a fight, establishing a base in the Yantai-Weihai line, holding the neck of Bohai Bay, and cutting off the maritime traffic between Shandong and the Northeast. The so-called joint garrison was only the first step, followed by bringing in a large number of Kuomintang troops and secret agents, and finally driving us away. Therefore, accepting their demand for a joint garrison was essentially equivalent to handing over Yantai to the U.S. military and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

    In order to cope with serious situations, we immediately reported to the military region, asking them to conduct emergency war preparations in the troops and prepare for contingencies. At the same time, the police force at the pier was instructed to maintain a serious attitude of defending the motherland's land towards the "guests" who were about to land, only allowing the U.S. military commander and a few entourages to go ashore, and the rest of the people to remain on the small boat, the small boat must leave the pier, and those who go ashore are not allowed to carry weapons, and our army reserves the right to inspect anyone.

    II

    At ten o'clock, they arrived at the Foreign Affairs Office, including Vice Admiral Barbey, Major General Roc, Rear Admiral Settel and several sea, land, and air officers, as well as several newspaper reporters. I negotiated with them as the political commissar of the garrison. After introductions and customary formalities, Vice Admiral Barbey spoke first: "Your soldiers are very spirited." Rear Admiral Settel immediately added, "They are more spirited than before." After speaking, he tilted his head. I thought to myself, probably our soldiers' serious actions on the pier had attracted their attention, and replied, "Our soldiers who have been tested in war are proud to defend their sacred homeland."

    Then, the struggle between the two sides quickly unfolded.

    Arrogant Major General Roc began to ask questions:
      "General Zhong, where and when do you intend to allow us to land? After landing, where will we be stationed?"
    Vice Admiral Barbey quickly interjected and said slowly:
      "I think, both sides should designate some staff members to study it clearly on the map, propose a plan, and submit it to both of us for approval."
    Listen to how beautifully they thought and how easily they spoke! It seemed that Yantai was already theirs, waiting for our army to hand over. Can we give them the land we liberated with battles for nothing?

    Hold on --
    "There is no hurry to talk about the landing plan. First, please explain why you want to land on the land that the Chinese people's army has already liberated?"
      "We are here to collect the weapons of the Japanese," Roc hurriedly replied.
      "The Japanese were wiped out and driven away by our army a month ago. Rear Admiral Settel is clear about this. He has already publicly stated this true situation to reporters. I think he wouldn't fail to introduce it to you, would he?"
    "I said it, and I also reported it to my superior, Vice Admiral Barbey," Settel said embarrassedly.

    However, the shameless Roc still quibbled:
    "We are here to clear the mines set up by the Japanese in Yantai Port."
    "We will handle this very well," I said.
    "Then, may I ask, do you agree to our joint garrison?"
    "I can repeat again that your army's landing on the land that our army has already liberated, as well as anything like a joint garrison, is incomprehensible. For the sake of the friendship of our allies, I will say it again, your army should not land here. ..."
      These words angered General Roc, he stood up abruptly, and said sternly:
      "In that case, I ask your army to withdraw from Yantai City immediately. We want to move in here."
    Probably he thought that this would scare us. Unfortunately, he miscalculated because they didn’t understand what kind of people the Chinese Communists and the soldiers of the Eighth Route Army were. His words were both ridiculous and hateful. We tried our best to suppress the anger in our hearts, but showed great composure and seriousness. Such composure and seriousness probably surprised them. Barbey quickly took over:
      "What General Roc said was a request for your army to withdraw, a request, not a demand..."
      "It is a request, and it is only a request to your army, not including the Yantai government and police," Settel added to Vice Admiral Barbey's words, pretending to be smiling.
    Probably they felt that Roc had said it too bluntly, and this addition could gain the sympathy of our government colleagues. Obviously, this was a trap, but it was played too stupidly and clumsily.

    I tried my best to restrain my anger, sat firmly on the sofa, and replied to their challenge in a normal tone:
      "Whether it is General Roc's demand or General Barbey's request, the essence is the same, nothing more than wanting our army to withdraw and let you in. There can only be one explanation for your request, and that is to openly aggress against the Chinese people! To forcibly occupy Yantai, which was liberated by our army. May I ask: can this be called the friendship of allies? No, this can only be called aggression!"
      The word "aggression" was something that the American generals at the time were very afraid to hear. They were afraid of being exposed. It looked like they were a little embarrassed, exchanged glances, and for a while, a tense look was already revealed. General Roc's face even looked a little swollen. Settel shrugged his shoulders, wanting to say something, but didn't say it. Roc became even more arrogant:
    "I am ordered by Admiral Kinkaid to come and garrison Yantai. For the sake of our friendship, in order to avoid unexpected incidents, please ask your army to withdraw to the suburbs. I am a soldier, and my duty is to obey orders."
    The situation has developed to an extremely tense point. Representing the interests of the Party and the Chinese people, I stood up and answered solemnly and resolutely:
      "I am also a soldier, and I fully understand how to fulfill my duties. I am ordered to garrison Yantai, and I know how to defend it from any enemy's invasion. In the long war, we have learned how to deal with aggressors. I want to warn General Roc that if you dare to invade Yantai, then all consequences must be borne by you."
    There was nothing more to say.
    Rear Admiral Settel panicked, fearing that he would not be able to get off the stage, and quickly said "Please sit down." General Roc sat down, and I also sat down. Barbey still came out to smooth things over:
    "We can negotiate slowly. I suggest that both sides consult with their respective superiors and make a decision."
    At this time, General Settel immediately echoed: "That's very good."
    The situation eased. General Settel exhausted his diplomatic skills, racking his brains to find some idle talk to ease the tense situation that had formed at that time. Roc, who was still sulking just now, acted as if nothing had happened and even talked to me in a relatively mild tone, and also showed courtesy to the secretary sitting next to Comrade Yu Guying and me from time to time. I thought to myself: they must be playing some tricks again. When the old wolf disguises himself as an old woman, we must be especially vigilant against it. Sure enough, after Roc went around in circles a few times, he suddenly asked me: "How many troops do you plan to use to defend the Yantai-Weihai line?" When he spoke, he pretended to be nonchalant, as if he was talking to me about everyday things. I also pretended to be nonchalant and said, "It all depends on the needs of the situation." This sentence shut General Roc's mouth, and he didn't speak for a long time. When I was waiting for their next move, General Barbey changed the topic:
    "The weather is very good today... I saw that the streets of Yantai are very clean..."
    "Thank you for your praise. We peace-loving and free people will arrange our lives well once we have gained independence and peace."

    Then, the "guests" said goodbye.
    However, the struggle had just finished its first act.

    III

    Our army was righteous and the U.S. military was at a loss for words. They lost the first round of the struggle. It stands to reason that since they have lost, they should give up the attempt to land. But the invaders will not give up easily. After hitting a snag, "asking for instructions from superiors" is just a "buffer" out of necessity. And the next step is likely to take more barbaric means, or even forcibly land. We must estimate from the worst, concentrate our efforts to consider further countermeasures.

    We carefully studied the relevant parts of Chairman Mao's "On the Coalition Government," consulted several short telegrams from the Central Committee regarding the attitude towards the U.S. military, and carefully understood the instructions of the District Party Committee and the Military Region. The thread of thought gradually became clear, focusing on two lines: one is that we give in, and the other is that we force them to give in. If we give in, that is to withdraw the troops and temporarily let the government organs and police persist in the city. However, it is certain that the government organs and police will not be able to persist for long, so Yantai will eventually be lost. Once Yantai is lost, it will be difficult to protect Weihai and the ports of Fushan and Penglai. If this is the case, the problem is serious. What about the sea communication with the Northeast? Cutting off this traffic line is clearly the direct purpose of the U.S. military at present. What about the future situation? It will be even more unfavorable to me, so we must never give in. If we don't give in, there is only one way to resolutely refuse the U.S. military to land. What will be the result of this? One possibility is: the U.S. military, under our righteous accusations, will abandon the attempt to land. Judging from the overall international situation at the time, it is possible. It is estimated that the United States does not dare to easily expose the face of their invaders. For the sake of a Yantai, abandoning the banner of "allies" and "friendship" may not be worthwhile for them, so our "hard" may also lead to the "soft" of the U.S. military. Another possibility is: the U.S. military will disregard everything, forcibly land, and then deny political responsibility after creating a fait accompli; if he forcibly invades, I will counter the invasion, block the invaders, and resolutely fight down the invaders' fierce flames.

    After repeated discussions, we decided: resolutely refuse the U.S. military to land.

    In order to cope with the serious situation that might occur, we ordered the troops to immediately strengthen fortifications on the coast that could be used as landing sites and conduct combat mobilization. It was also decided to hold a mass rally of citizens at four o'clock in the afternoon, followed by an anti-aggression demonstration parade to further mobilize the masses.

    IV

    At four o'clock in the afternoon, the large stadium was crowded with excited people. Yellow clouds were racing across the sky, and the sea breeze blowing from the north aggravated the gloom of the weather. People's moods were more turbulent and indignant than the flying clouds and sea breeze.

    At four o'clock, Comrade Yu Guying and I arrived at the stadium and squeezed into the crowd. People looked at us with expectant eyes, as if asking, "How did your negotiations with the Americans go?" Comrade Yu Guying and I both spoke at the mass rally, recounting the process of negotiations with the U.S. military generals and expressing our determination to resolutely defend Yantai and resolutely oppose the U.S. military's aggression. Our words encouraged the 40,000 to 50,000 citizens, and many people shed tears of excitement. They swore to resolutely defend their land. An old porter squeezed over, grabbed my hand, and said with great excitement: "Political Commissar, we can't let the Americans come! We can't drive away the wolf from the front door and let the tiger in through the back door. The workers have just turned over a new leaf after the Eighth Route Army came, and we can't turn back. Whatever you want us to do, we can do. Although I am old, it is enough to fight one of them..." His words represented the hearts of all the citizens of Yantai, and spoke out the indestructible will of the victorious Chinese people. In front of such heroic people, what we felt was strength, the strength to break through all difficulties and defeat all enemies.

    During the rally, U.S. naval reconnaissance planes flew low over the venue several times. In the past, people would probably rush to take air raid precautions, but today no one moved, and no one took it seriously. Each time it flew over, it deepened the hatred in the hearts of the people who were already angry and increased the strength of the fight.

    The conference was very successful. After the meeting, the procession started out in several directions. The shouts of "Oppose U.S. Military Aggression" and "Aggressors Get Out" drowned out the buzzing of the U.S. planes, passed over the city sky, and over the ocean...

    The marching crowd, like an unstoppable torrent, converged on the seaside road from all directions. Facing the American fleet, the angered people waved their fists and shouted loudly: "If the Americans dare to come up, we will beat them back!" The workers demanded one after another: it is not enough to establish a dock workers' inspection team, we must arm all the workers; the students also asked to be given weapons. The demonstrators gradually dispersed until it was completely dark, under the persuasion of the comrades from the government and the "All-Circles National Salvation Association."

    The armed forces did not participate in this demonstration parade. They were making tense war preparations. Our battle-tested commanders and fighters understood the preciousness of peace most, and therefore, when a new enemy dared to seize the fruits of victory from our hands, they were more easily angered and turned into fearless combat strength. ...

    Night fell. We returned to the office. Now it's time to carefully check the organizational work to deal with serious incidents.

    The staff comrades of the headquarters and the commanders and political commissars of the troops came, they reported on the deployment and the strengthening of fortifications, as well as the contact with the military sub-district headquarters, everything was very good.

    The city government came to report: important materials have been transported out, and non-essential staff are also preparing to withdraw to the mountains;
    The commander of the coastal defense called to report: the morale of the troops is high, the fighting spirit is strong, and the American ships are being closely guarded;
    The director of the Public Security Bureau came, he personally inspected the city, the order in the city was very good, the public security measures were very effective, and no accidents occurred. ...

    It was late at night. The three of us were constantly caring for each other: "Go to sleep for a while!" But no one wanted to go to sleep.

    Time has advanced from the 6th to the 7th. Just after one o'clock, Yu Dashen, the president of Yantai Daily, suddenly ran in, panting and sweating: "Good news—"
      "What good news? Tell me quickly!"
    "Chief of Staff Ye Jianying has issued a statement refusing the U.S. military to land in Yantai."
    "Great! The Central Committee has protested to the U.S. military!"
    "... Chief of Staff Ye Jianying of the Eighteenth Group Army, because the U.S. Marine Corps intends to land in Yantai and requires the Eighteenth Group Army and the Yantai Municipal Government to withdraw from Yantai City, specially sent a letter to Colonel Yeton of the U.S. Military Observer Group on the 6th, believing that the Japanese puppet troops in Yantai had been completely disarmed long ago, and the order in the urban area was stable, and the U.S. military's request to land there was completely unnecessary. Please forward it to the U.S. military headquarters and order the U.S. Marine Corps on the sea off Yantai not to land in Yantai. If they forcibly land there without consultation with our army and any serious incident occurs as a result, the U.S. side shall be fully responsible. The original letter is as follows: (omitted)" Comrade Yu Dashen quickly finished reading the full text.

    Just as Yu Dashen was reading the newspaper, we received a telegram from the District Party Committee and the Military Region, instructing us to follow Chief of Staff Ye's letter and resolutely refuse the U.S. military to land.

    We decided to translate Chief of Staff Ye's letter into English, print it out as a Chinese version, and forward it to Vice Admiral Barbey to refuse the U.S. military to land.

    V

    Morning of the 7th. The Yantai sentry reported that all the U.S. ships had lit their fires, but had not moved yet.

    At around 6:30, the Yantai Mountain flag station reported that the U.S. flagship sent a flag signal saying: "Landing at 7:15." At seven o'clock, the flag station reported again: two small boats had left the U.S. flagship and were heading towards our pier, and the entire fleet was still. At 7:15, the pier guard force reported that Barbey and other American generals had arrived at the pier, saying they were here to say goodbye and asked if they were allowed to land. Reply: Yes, take them to the foreign affairs office.

    In the foreign affairs office, Vice Admiral Barbey met me and said flatteringly: "Based on my strong suggestion, Admiral Kinkaid has approved that it is not necessary to land here, and I have come specifically to say goodbye. But General Settel and his detachment will remain here for liaison."
    Courtesy demands reciprocity. You came to say goodbye, and I will see you off. After they returned to the ship, Comrade Yu Guying and I boarded a small motorboat to go to the American ship to return the courtesy and see them off. Because the wind was too strong, the small boat could not leave the port, so we changed the flag signal from the "flag station": "...Going to the ship to see you off, the wind is too strong, I am very sorry." Answer: "Thank you very much."

    Soon they weighed anchor and left Yantai.
    In this tense struggle, victory belonged to us.
    However, the story did not end there.

    VI

    At dusk on October 16, General Settel's fleet suddenly all left, and the outside of the port appeared very empty.

    Why did they leave without saying goodbye? Did something major happen that they didn't even have time to say goodbye? No, no, they must be playing new tricks and plotting new conspiracies.

    As expected. On the morning of October 17, Kuomintang bandit gunboats and ships loaded with weapons sailed into the port and occupied Kongtong Island, where they intercepted passing ships. According to the reports of the fishermen who were robbed and escaped back, and the army's intelligence, it was confirmed that it was Zhang Liye, the puppet army originally stationed in the Yantai area, who today put on the Kuomintang army's flag. The looting behavior of this gang of bandits aroused the public outrage of the people, who demanded that our army be sent out to wipe them out. Our army naturally had to accept the people's demands and protect the people's interests. After repeatedly persuading the bandit unit to turn over a new leaf and failing, our army launched an attack in two directions at dawn on the 29th. After a short period of fierce fighting, the bandit army was completely wiped out. Bandit Battalion Commander Jia Feng was chased by our forces, ran out of the way, and drowned in the sea.

    Who knew that on the second day of the Kongtong naval battle, General Settel returned again and came ashore to visit our military and government authorities. When he saw us, the first thing he said was to congratulate our army on the victory of the naval battle, and stated that the U.S. military's temporary departure was to avoid participating in China's internal struggles.

    Look at how cleverly the United States cooperated with the Kuomintang bandits, and how naive and ridiculous the lies made up by the U.S. military generals were! But neither the direct aggression of the U.S. ships nor the harassment of the Kuomintang bandits under command succeeded. This struggle gave us a new training, learned some new things, and more clearly recognized the U.S. imperialism's set of tricks: intimidation and blackmail is the first step, if it doesn't work, then resort to deception, if it still doesn't work, then act like a rogue, and finally roll away.

    This is the experience of the U.S. warship invading Yantai in 1945 and being driven out by the people.

    剥去美军的画皮
    少将　仲曦东
    1945年10月1日清晨，烟台海面上突然驶来了五只美国兵舰。它们的来临，像一朵乌云遮住了晴朗的天空，人民因解放而欢乐的心，随着紧张起来了。
    这个所谓“盟军”，在长期的抗日战争中从没有见他来过，现在抗日战争胜利了，烟台解放了，他倒来了，他们来干什么呢？
    据这个舰队的司令赛特尔少将说，他们是来查看日本投降的情况和美侨在烟台的财产的，可是当他们知道烟台的日伪军已在一个月前被八路军消灭和驱逐了，就应当马上开走，可是他们却又在与我军政当局“接洽建立友好关系”的幌子下，厚着脸皮不肯立即驶去。而且就在他们所谓查看美侨的财产时，多次不知羞耻地硬要闯进我东炮台一带的军事禁区，甚至企图强进我军营房。他们要求准许他们的水兵在崆峒岛上休息游玩。我们经上级批准答应了他，并派了一些人去作招待工作，同美国水兵联欢。谁知他们来了一次再不来了。事后得悉，原来是怕我们把他们的水兵“赤化”了。在美国舰队来过之后，美国空军的大编队和海军飞机又先后在我军事禁区上空盘旋。对这件事，我军曾向赛特尔少将提出过严正抗议。赛特尔却说：“这是一种庆祝活动，庆祝贵军解放了烟台。”并说：“如果贵军不欢迎，今后保证不再有同样行动了。”尽管赛特尔将军作了这样的保证，可是美国的飞机仍然不断地在我领空活动。当我们严正地警告：决不能容忍这种行为，后果要他负责时，他又说：“要特别珍视贵我之间的友谊。”
    他们这种行动，使我们有理由警惕他们来意不善。在这种情况下，根据胶东区党委和胶东军区的指示，把烟台党、政、军、民组成统一的行动委员会，以便应付突然事变。我被指派为这个委员会的书记。
    一
    果然不出我们所料，美军的假面目很快就自行揭穿了。10月4日，美舰的副官送来了“通牒”，要我军撤离烟台，并向他们办移交。我们当即提出严重抗议。副官表示将我方的抗议转达他们的上级。
    10月6日，天刚破晓，大批美国兵舰驶进了烟台港，旋即抛下了锚。有一小艇靠了码头，来人到外事办公厅把于谷莺同志（特派员）请上美舰商谈去了。
    将近九点钟，于谷莺同志回来了，简要地叙述了他去美舰的经过，并介绍了美军的情况。这个舰队是美军太平洋舰队中的黄海舰队，载有两栖作战部队，海军司令是巴尔贝中将，两栖部队作战司令是罗克少将。他们到这里来，是运送两栖作战部队在烟台登陆，要我军向他们办理“移交”，最少也要和我军共同驻防。据他们说：十时，他们的司令官就要来我外事办公厅，同我驻军当局协商划分防区和登陆地点、时间等问题。这是赤裸裸的侵略行为！大家十分气愤。我们立即分析形势，决定对策。经过研究，一致认为美军这种行动是一种打着“盟邦”的旗号，进行讹诈撞骗，企图用优势的兵力把我们吓倒，以达到不战而取得烟台，在烟台威海一线建立基地，卡住渤海湾的脖子，截断山东同东北的海上交通。所谓共同驻防只是第一步，接着就会把大批国民党的军队和特务接进来，最后把我们赶走。因此，接受他们的共同驻防的要求，实质上等于把烟台让给美军，让给国民党反动派。
    为了应付万一的严重情况，我们立即报告了军区，请他们在部队里进行紧急的战备动员，作好应变的准备。同时指示码头上的警备部队，对即将登陆来访的“客人”，必须保持严肃的保卫祖国土地的负责态度，只准许美军的司令官和少数随员上岸，其余的人留在小艇上，小艇必须驶离码头，上岸的人不准携带武器，我军对于任何人都保留检查的权利。
    二
    十时，他们来到了外事办公厅，其中有巴尔贝海军中将、罗克少将、赛特尔海军少将和若干海、陆、空的校官以及几个新闻记者。我作为驻军的政治委员和他们谈判。经过介绍和例行的礼节之后，巴尔贝中将首先说话了：“你们的士兵很有精神。”赛特尔少将紧接着又补充了一句：“他们比往日更有精神。”说完歪了一下脑袋。我心里想，大概我们在码头上的战士对他们的严肃的行动，已引起他们的注意，便回答说：“我们久经战火考验的战士，以守卫自己神圣的国土而感到自豪。”
    接着，双方的斗争很快就展开了。
    骄横的罗克少将开始提出了问题：
      “请问仲将军，你打算让我们在什么地点、什么时间登陆？登陆之后，我们驻扎在什么地方？”
    巴尔贝中将赶快插了进来，慢条斯理地说：
      “我看，双方指定一些参谋人员，在地图上研究明白，提出计划，交我们双方批准好了。”
    听吧，他们想得多么美，说得多么轻松啊！好像烟台已经是他们的了，只等我军向他们办“移交”了似的。难道我们用战斗解放了的国土，能白白送给他们么？
    且慢——
    “现在不忙谈论登陆计划问题，首先请阁下说明：你们为什么要在中国人民的军队早已解放了的土地上登陆？”
      “我们是来收缴日本人的武器的。”罗克急忙回答道。
      “日本人早在一个月前就被我军消灭和驱逐了，这一点，赛特尔少将是清楚的，他已经对记者公开说过了这一真实的情况。我想，他不会不向阁下介绍吧？”
    “我说过，我也向我的上级巴尔贝中将报告过。”赛特尔难为情地说。
    可是，不知羞耻的罗克，却仍然狡辩：
    “我们是来清除日本人在烟台港口所设置的水雷的。”
    “这，我们会很好处理。”我说。
    “那么，请问，阁下是否同意我们共同驻防？”
    “我可以再重复一遍，贵军要在我军早已解放了的土地上登陆，以及什么共同驻防之类，是令人不可理解的。为了我们同盟邦的友谊，我再说一遍，贵军不宜在此登陆。……”
      这番话，可气坏了罗克将军，他霍地站了起来，声色俱厉地说：
      “既然这样，我请贵军立即撤出烟台市。我们要进驻这里。”
    大概他满以为这一下就可以把我们吓住了。可惜，他估计错了，因为他们根本不了解中国共产党人、八路军的战士是些什么样的人。他的话既可笑又可恨。我们竭力抑制内心的愤怒，却表现出非常的镇静和严肃。这样的镇静和严肃，大概很出乎他们的意外，巴尔贝于是赶快接过了话头：
      “罗克将军说的是请求贵军撤出去，是请求，不是要求……”
      “是请求，而且只是请求贵军，不包括烟台的政府和警察。”赛特尔装作笑咪咪的样子补充了巴尔贝中将的话。
    大概他们觉得罗克说得太露骨了，他们这一补充就可以取得我们政府工作同志的同情似的。显然，这是一个圈套，不过，玩得太愚蠢、太笨拙了。
    我竭力克制自己的怒火，稳坐在沙发上，用通常的声调，答复了他们的挑战：
      “无论罗克将军的要求也好，或者是巴尔贝将军的请求也好，实质都是一样的，无非要我军撤出去，让你们进来。对于你们这种要求，只能有一个解释，就是对中国人民进行公开的侵略！要强占我军解放了的烟台。试问：这能叫做盟邦的友谊么？不能，这只能叫侵略！”
      “侵略”二字，当时的美国将军们是很害怕听的，他们怕被揭露真面目。看样子他们有点窘了，互相交换了一下眼色，一时，紧张的神色已显露出来了，罗克将军的脸看来甚至都有些肿胀了。赛特尔耸了一下肩膀，想说什么，可是没有说出来。罗克则更加蛮横起来了：
    “我奉金盖德海军上将的命令，前来进驻烟台。为了我们的友谊，为了避免意外事件，还是请贵军撤到市郊去。我是军人，我的天职是服从命令。”
    情况已发展到极其紧张的地步。我代表着党和中国人民的利益，站起来庄严地、坚决地回答道：
      “我也是军人，我完全懂得怎样履行我的职务。我奉命警备烟台，我懂得该怎样保卫它不受任何敌人的侵犯。我们在长期的战争中，已经学会了怎样对付侵略者。我要正告罗克将军，如果你们胆敢侵略烟台的话，那么一切后果须由你们负全部的责任。”
    再没有什么可说的了。
    赛特尔少将慌张了，害怕下不了台，连忙说了一声“请坐”。罗克将军坐下了，我也坐了下来，还是巴尔贝将军出来圆场：
    “我们可以慢慢协商。我建议贵我双方都请示一下各自的上级，再作决定。”
    这时赛特尔将军立刻附和说：“这样很好。”
    形势和缓了。赛特尔将军用尽了他的外交伎俩，搜肠刮肚地找些闲话来缓和当时所形成的紧张局势。刚才还在呕气的罗克，好像什么事都没有发生过一样，竟也用了比较温和的腔调和我攀谈起来，而且装得兴趣很浓，还不时对坐在我和于谷莺同志旁边的秘书献殷勤。我心里想：他们准又要玩什么花样。当老狼把自己化装成老太婆的时候，是要特别对它警惕的。果然，罗克兜了几个圈子之后，突然问我：“阁下打算用多少兵力防守烟台威海卫一线？”说话的时候装出满不在乎的样儿，好像在同我谈家常。我也摆出不在乎的样儿说：“完全看情况需要而定。”这一句话，封住了罗克将军的嘴，他半天没有再说话。当我正等待他们下一着的时候，巴尔贝将军却转了话题：
    “今天的天气很好，……我看到烟台的街道很清洁。……”
    “谢谢阁下的赞誉。我们热爱和平和自由的人们，一旦获得了独立与和平，是会很好安排自己的生活的。”
    接着，“客人”们告辞了。
    不过，斗争刚演过了第一幕。
    三
    我军词严义正，美军理屈词穷，斗争的第一回合，他们输了。照理说，既然输了，就应该放弃登陆的企图。但侵略者是不会轻易死心的。在碰了钉子之后，来个“请示上级”，只是不得已的一个“缓冲”罢了。而下一步，很可能采取更蛮横的手段，甚至强行登陆。我们必须从最坏的方面来估计，集中精力考虑进一步的对策。
    我们细心钻研毛主席的《论联合政府》的有关部分，查阅中央关于对待美军的态度的几次简短的电文，仔细体会区党委与军区的指示，思想的线索逐渐清晰了，集中为两条线，一条是我们让步，一条是迫使他们让步。如果我们让步，那就是把军队撤出去，暂时让政府机关和警察在市内坚持，但是，可以肯定，政府机关和警察，是坚持不了多久的，这样烟台终究是要丢的，烟台一丢，威海和福山、蓬莱几个港口，也很难保得住；这样一来，问题就严重了，与东北的海上交通怎么办？而截断这条交通线显然是美军当前的直接目的。以后的形势呢？对于我将更加不利，所以绝对不能让步。我们不让步，就只有坚决拒绝美军登陆一条路了。这将会出现怎样的结局呢？一种可能是：美军在我正义的指责下，放弃登陆企图，就当时国际上总的形势来判断是有可能的，估计美国还不敢轻易暴露他们的侵略者的面目。为了一个烟台，而抛弃“盟邦”、“友谊”的旗号，对他们未必是合算的，所以我们的“硬”也可能导致美军的“软”。一种可能是：美军不顾一切，强行登陆，造成事实之后，再来抵赖政治责任；他若强行侵略，我就反侵略，兵来将挡，坚决地打下侵略者的凶焰。
    反复讨论之后，我们决定：坚决拒绝美军登陆。
    为了应付一旦发生的严重局面，我们命令部队立即在可能作为登陆场的海岸加强工事，并进行战斗动员。又决定下午四点钟召开市民大会，会后举行反侵略大示威游行，进一步发动群众。
    四
    下午四点钟，大体育场挤满了激动的人群，天空飞驰着黄色的云层，北面吹来的海风，加重了天气的阴沉。人们的心情比飞云海风更为奔腾和激愤。
    四点钟，我同于谷莺同志来到了体育场，挤进人群当中。人们用期待的眼光注视着我们，好像在问：“你们和美国人的交涉办得怎么样了？”于谷莺同志和我都在群众大会上讲了话，述说了同美军将领谈判的经过，表示了我们坚决保卫烟台，坚决反对美军侵略的决心。我们的话鼓舞了四、五万市民，很多人激动地流下了眼泪，他们宣誓：坚决保卫自己的土地。一个老搬运工人，挤过来抓住我的手，万分激动地说：“政委，可不能让美国人来呀！我们不能前门赶走狼，后门放进虎来。八路军来了，工人刚翻了身，不能再翻回去，你们要我们干什么，我们都能干。我虽老了，拼他一个也够本。……”他的话，代表了全烟台市民的心意，说出了胜利的中国人民的坚不可摧的意志，在这样英雄的人民面前，我们所感到的是力量，能冲破一切困难，战胜一切敌人的力量。
    大会进行中，美国海军的侦察飞机，几次低空掠过会场。在往日，人们大概要争先恐后地去防空了，可是，今天没有一个人动弹，根本不把它放在眼下。它每次飞过，都使人们已经激怒了的心更加深一分仇恨，更增加一分战斗的力量。
    大会开得十分成功。会后，游行队伍分路出发了。“反对美军侵略”、“侵略者滚出去”的口号声淹没了美机的嗡嗡声，越过市空，越过了海洋……
    游行的人群，像不可遏止的洪流，从四面八方汇集在海滨的马路上。面对着美国的舰队，被激怒了的人们，挥舞着拳头高声呼喊：“美国人敢上来，就把他揍回去！”工人们纷纷要求：光成立码头工人纠查队还不够，要武装全体工人；学生也要求发给他们武器。示威的人群，直到天完全黑了下来，才在政府和“各界救国会”的同志说服下逐渐散去。
    武装部队没有参加这次示威游行，他们在紧张地进行备战。我们的久经战火考验的指战员们，是最理解和平的可贵的，因而当新的敌人敢于夺取我们手里的胜利的果实时，就越易被激怒而化为无畏的战斗力量。……
    入夜了。我们回到了办公室。现在该仔细检查应付严重事变的组织工作了。
    司令部的参谋同志和部队的指挥员、政治委员来了，他们报告了部署和工事加强的情况，以及和军分区司令部联系的情况，一切很好。
    市政府来了报告：重要物资已经在外运，非必要的工作人员也准备撤到山前去；
    海岸防御的指挥员来电话报告：部队士气很高，斗志旺盛，对美舰在严密警戒着；
    公安局长来了，他亲自巡视了全市，市内秩序很好，治安措施很有成效，没有发生事故。……
    夜深了。我们三个人都不断互相关照着：“你去睡一会吧！”可是谁也不想去睡。
    时间已从6日进到7日了，一点钟刚打过，烟台日报社社长于大绅同志突然跑了进来，气呼呼的，头上冒着汗：“好消息——”
      “什么好消息？快说！”
    “叶剑英参谋长发表了声明，拒绝美军在烟台登陆。”
    “好啊！中央向美军提出抗议了！”
    “……十八集团军参谋长叶剑英，顷因美国海军陆战队拟在烟台登陆，并要求十八集团军及烟台市政府撤离烟台市，特于6日致函美军观察组叶顿上校，认为烟台日伪军队早已完全解除武装，市区秩序安定，美军要求在该处登陆，毫无必要。请其转达美军总部，命令烟台海面美海军陆战队，勿在烟台登陆，如未经与我军商妥，竟然在该地强行登陆，因而发生任何严重事件，应由美方负其全责。原函如下：（略）”于大绅同志很快读完了全文。
    就在于大绅读报的过程中，又接到区党委与军区的电报，指示我们遵照叶参谋长的信件，坚决拒绝美军登陆。
    我们决定把叶参谋长的信译成英文，作为中文的附本打印出来，转给巴尔贝中将，拒绝美军登陆。
    五
    7日晨。烟台警戒哨报告，美舰全都升了火，暂时还没有动。
    六时半左右，烟台山旗台报告，美旗舰打出了旗语，说：“七点一刻登陆”。七点，旗台又报告：有两艘小艇离开了美军的旗舰向我码头驶来，整个舰队无动静。七点一刻，码头警备部队报告，巴尔贝等美国将军驶抵码头，说是来辞行，请示是否准其登陆。答复：准，接他们到外事办公厅。
    在外事办公厅，巴尔贝中将见了我，讨好地说：“根据我的有力的建议，金盖德上将已批准不必在此登陆，特来告别。但赛特尔将军和他的分舰队仍然留此，以资联络。”
    礼尚往来，你来辞行，我就送行。他们回舰后，我同于谷莺同志登上小汽艇，去美舰答礼送行，因为风太大，小艇驶不出港口，改由“旗台”发出旗语：“……赴舰送行，风大未果，歉甚。”答：“十分感谢。”
    不久他们就启锚离开了烟台。
    这一场紧张的斗争，胜利属于了我们。
    不过，故事并没有就此结束。
    六
    10月16日黄昏，赛特尔将军的舰队，突然全部开走了，港外显得十分空阔。
    他们为什么不辞而别呢？难道发生了什么大事故，竟连辞行也来不及么？不，不会的，准是在耍新花样，搞新阴谋。
    果然不出所料。10月17日晨，国民党匪帮的炮艇和装有武器的船只，驶进了口子里，并占据了崆峒岛，在那里拦劫过往的船只。根据被劫后逃回来的渔民的报告和军队的情报，证实那是原来驻在烟台一带的伪军张立叶，今天又打上了国民党军的旗号。这支匪帮的劫掠行为，激起了人民的公愤，纷纷要求我军出动歼灭。我军自然要接受人民的要求，保卫人民的利益。经过再三劝说该匪部改邪归正无效之后，我军于29日拂晓分两路进击，经过短时间的激战，就将匪军全部歼灭。匪营长贾风被我追击，走头无路，坠海而死。
    谁知在崆峒海战第二天，赛特尔将军又回来了，并且上岸来拜会我军政当局。见了我们，第一句话就是祝贺我军海战的胜利，并声明，美军所以暂时离开，是为了避免参与中国内部的斗争。
    请看，美国与国民党匪帮的配合是多么巧妙，美军将领编的谎话多么幼稚可笑！可是不论美舰的直接侵略也好，或者是指挥国民党匪帮骚扰也好，都没有得逞。这次斗争，使我们受到一次新的锻炼，学到了一些新东西，也更清楚地认识了美帝国主义的一套把戏：恫吓讹诈是第一手，不成时则改用欺骗，再不成则耍无赖，最后滚蛋了事。
    这就是美舰在1945年侵入烟台和被人民撵出去的经过。
