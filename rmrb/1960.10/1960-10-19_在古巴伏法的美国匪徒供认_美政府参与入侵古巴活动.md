Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 17th: The trial of the last group of American mercenaries and Batista criminals who participated in the counter-revolutionary landing in Navas Bay and were arrested in Oriente Province has once again proven the direct involvement of the United States government in the aggression against Cuba.

American citizen Robert Fuller confessed during the trial that he was a former member of the United States Marine Corps, and said that the armed invaders departed from Miami. He admitted that the weapons used for the landing were American weapons, and the military uniforms they wore were those used by the US military in the last World War.

Fuller also confessed that he participated in this invasion aimed at undermining land reform, seizing land from Cuban peasants, and recovering his father's large estate in Cuba that had been confiscated.

Another captured person, Angel Maria Rivera Sanchez, confessed that there were camps in Miami for training mercenaries to invade Cuba, and that this training was carried out there under the protection of the American authorities.

These two men were members of a group of invaders recently arrested near the US naval base at Guantanamo. They went there to seek the protection of the American military authorities in order to escape the sanctions of the revolutionary court. Among this group of invaders was also the American Alan Thompson.

The prosecutor of the Santiago Revolutionary Court stated, based on the accumulated evidence: "On behalf of the Cuban people and on behalf of all freedom-loving people in the world, I accuse the United States government of the crime of arming mercenaries to invade the motherland of the Cuban people."

In order to fulfill the verdict of the Revolutionary Court, these Americans have been executed by firing squad.

    在古巴伏法的美国匪徒供认
    美政府参与入侵古巴活动
    据新华社哈瓦那17日电　对参加在纳瓦斯湾反革命登陆并且在奥连特省被逮捕的最后一批美国雇佣兵和巴蒂斯塔罪犯的审判再次证明美国政府直接参与了对古巴的侵略活动。
    美国公民罗伯特·富勒在审判中供认，他曾是美国海军陆战队成员，并说武装入侵者是由迈阿密动身的。他承认，登陆使用的武器是美国武器，他们所穿的军衣是美军在上次世界大战所使用的军衣。
    富勒还供认，他曾参加了这次目的在于破坏土地改革、夺取古巴农民土地和收回他父亲的在古巴已被征用的大庄园的侵略行动。
    另一个被俘者安赫耳·玛丽亚·里维拉·桑切斯供认在迈阿密设有训练侵略古巴的雇佣兵的营地，在美国当局的庇护下在那里进行这种训练。
    这两个人是最近在美国海军基地关塔那摩附近逮捕的一批入侵者中的成员，他们到那里去寻找美国军事当局的保护，以便逃脱革命法庭的制裁。在这一批入侵者中还有美国人阿兰·汤普森。
    圣地亚哥革命法庭检察官根据积累的证据表示说：“我代表古巴人民、代表世界上所有爱好自由的人们控告美国政府武装雇佣军来侵犯古巴人的祖国的罪行”。
    为了履行革命法庭的判决，上述这些美国人已经被枪决。
