Short commentary:

    The vast countryside of our country is a broad market for the consumption of various small commodities. Commercial departments must find ways to open up sources of goods from various aspects, and try their best to meet the needs of the broad masses of people for small commodities.
    One way: Rely on large cities and rely on allocations from higher levels to strive to realize allocation plans and organize the distribution of these small commodities to the countryside. Another way: Rely on our own efforts, organize forces locally, and produce locally to solve our own needs. Both methods are important, but the latter is of more practical significance than the former. The Wuqiang Central Store in Shen County, Hebei Province, is an example of relying on its own strength to actively solve the local supply of small commodities. This store first investigated the local commune and team industrial production equipment and technical capabilities according to the needs of its members; then, it adopted various methods to vigorously organize the production of small commodities: if the factory lacked cadres, it sent cadres to the factory to guide production; if there was a shortage of raw materials, it launched local purchases to solve it; if there was a lack of technology, it sent people to other places to study. Because they adopted the method of self-reliance and fully tapped the potential of local human and material resources, they successfully opened up more than 200 kinds of seasonal small commodities.
    Self-reliance, producing some small commodities, and actively doing a good job in the supply of small commodities, is not only conducive to the prosperity of the rural economy and the improvement of commune members' lives, but also conducive to further promoting the purchase of agricultural products. Rural commercial departments in various regions should, like the Wuqiang store, start from organizing commune-run industrial production and participating in production, and do everything possible to expand the source of small commodities.

    自己动手
    我国广大农村是各种小商品消费的广阔市场。商业部门必需从多方面想办法开辟货源，尽可能地满足广大人民对小商品的需要。
    办法之一：依靠大城市、依靠上级调拨，努力实现调拨计划，组织好这部分小商品下乡。办法之二：自己动手，就地组织力量，就地生产，解决自己的需要。两个办法都重要，后者比前者则更有现实意义。河北深县武强中心商店，依靠自己的力量，主动解决当地小商品的供应问题，就是一个例子。这个商店，首先根据社员需要，调查了当地社队工业生产设备和技术能力；紧接着采用各种办法大力组织小商品生产：工厂缺少干部，就派出干部驻厂指导生产；缺少原料，就就地开展收购来解决；缺少技术，就派人到外地去学习。由于他们采取了自己动手的方法，充分挖掘了当地人力物力的潜力，结果，顺利开辟了二百多种当令小商品的货源。
    自己动手，生产部分小商品，并且积极做好小商品供应工作，不仅有利于繁荣农村经济和改善社员生活，而且也有利于进一步推动农产品收购工作。各地农村商业部门都应当像武强商店那样，从组织社办工业生产和参与生产入手，千方百计地为扩大小商品货源而努力。
