Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 17th: The Japanese Diet convened its 36th extraordinary session today. Due to the strong pressure from the Japanese people, the Japanese government will be forced to announce the dissolution of the House of Representatives during this ten-day Diet session, in order to hold general elections in late November.

This session is the first Diet meeting held since the Ikeda government came to power, and also the prelude to the upcoming general election. Therefore, Japanese democratic forces will wage a fierce struggle against conservative forces during this Diet session. The assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, the largest opposition party in Japan, before the general election, will also be one of the important issues discussed at this meeting.

Today, the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives held plenary sessions separately, allocated seats, and agreed on the session schedule, but substantive activities have not yet begun. According to the Diet session schedule agreed upon today by the Diet Policy Committee Chairmen of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party, Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda, along with the Foreign Minister, Finance Minister, and Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency, will deliver policy speeches on the 21st, and questioning of these four speeches by various political parties must be completed by the 22nd.

Japanese news agencies and radio stations reported that the Japanese House of Representatives will announce its dissolution on the 24th or 25th after the Diet debate concludes.

Currently, the Japanese people have launched a powerful movement protesting the assassination of Asanuma and demanding the immediate resignation of the Ikeda Cabinet. Following the nationwide strike of four million workers on the 15th, the Japanese people will hold a massive 23rd nationwide unified action against the new "Security Treaty" on the 20th. Faced with this increasingly unfavorable situation, the Ikeda government is conspiring to put on a hypocritical facade during this extraordinary Diet session, playing deceptive tricks to evade responsibility for Asanuma's assassination, and vainly attempting to ease the people's resistance. Ikeda today particularly emphasized at the Liberal Democratic Party's general meeting of Diet members the need to cope with this Diet session with "patience and cultured spirit." However, the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party have long decided on a policy of resolute struggle against the Ikeda Cabinet, demanding the resignation of the Ikeda Cabinet. The Socialist Party also made a resolution on this at the National Extraordinary Convention held on the 13th.

### 日本国会召开临时会议  民主力量将同保守势力展开激烈斗争

    日本国会召开临时会议
    民主力量将同保守势力展开激烈斗争
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本国会今天召开第三十六次临时会议。由于日本人民的强大压力，日本政府将被迫在这次为期十天的国会会议上宣布解散众议院，以便在11月下旬举行大选。
    这次会议是池田政府上台以后举行的第一次国会会议，也是即将举行的大选的前哨战，因而日本民主力量同保守势力将在这次国会会议中展开激烈的斗争。日本最大在野党社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎在大选前遭到暗杀的事件，也将是这次会议讨论的重要问题之一。
    今天，参议院和众议院分别举行了全体会议，分配了席位，议定了会期，但尚未开始实质性活动。根据自由民主党、社会党和民主社会党三党国会对策委员长今天商定的国会会议日程，日本首相池田勇人和外务相、藏相、经济企划厅长官将于21日发表施政演说，而各政党对这四个演说的质询必须在22日结束。
    日本的通讯社和电台报道，日本众议院将在国会辩论结束后的24日或25日宣布解散。
    目前，日本人民已经掀起了抗议杀害浅沼、要求池田内阁立即总辞职的强大运动。继15日四百万工人全国大罢工之后，日本人民将在20日举行声势浩大的第二十三次反对新“安全条约”全国统一行动。面临这种越来越不利的形势，池田政府正在阴谋在这次国会临时会议上装出伪善的姿态，玩弄欺骗的伎俩，来逃避暗杀浅沼的责任，妄图缓和人民的反抗。池田今天在自由民主党国会议员全体会议上为此特别强调要以什么“忍耐和有涵养的精神”来应付这次国会会议。但是，日本共产党和社会党都早已决定了同池田内阁坚决斗争的方针，要求池田内阁辞职，社会党并且在13日举行的全国临时代表大会上就此作出了决议。
