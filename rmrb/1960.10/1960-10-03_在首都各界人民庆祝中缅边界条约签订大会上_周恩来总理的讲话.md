Comrades and Friends, Esteemed Prime Minister U Nu, Esteemed General Ne Win, Esteemed Burmese Guests:

    Today, people from all walks of life in Beijing, the capital of China, are holding a grand rally here, celebrating the signing of the boundary treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma. Let us warmly congratulate this great joyous event of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Year! We are particularly pleased to have with us at this celebration Prime Minister U Nu of the Union of Burma, General Ne Win, Chief of Staff of the Burmese Armed Forces, the delegation of the Government of the Union of Burma, Brigadier General Aung Gyi, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Burmese Armed Forces and head of the Burmese delegation to the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee, Brigadier General Maung Maung, Inspector General of Training of the Burmese Armed Forces and head of the Military Friendship Delegation, U Myat, a member of the Burmese Parliament and head of the Trade Delegation, Colonel So Min, head of the Burmese Cultural Delegation, Lieutenant Colonel Maung Win, head of the Burmese Sports Delegation, and U Khin, head of the Burmese News Delegation, more than 300 distinguished guests. These delegations include senior officials of the Burmese government, party representatives from the Union Party of Burma and the National United Front of Burma, leaders of the Kachin State and Shan State, as well as well-known figures from military, economic, cultural, artistic, sports, and news circles of Burma. This is the largest, most numerous, and broadest friendly activity in the history of Sino-Burmese friendship. At the same time, residents of both countries living on the Sino-Burmese border are also conducting extensive and enthusiastic friendly gatherings. It is particularly worth mentioning that on the very day of the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, the Burmese government, through officials designated by our government, presented 2,000 tons of rice and 1,000 tons of salt to approximately one million Chinese residents near the Sino-Burmese border. All of this reflects the deep friendship between the people of China and Burma and marks a new climax in the friendly relations between the two countries. On behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, I would like to express my deep gratitude here once again to Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, and all the distinguished Burmese guests, and through you, to the Burmese people and the Government of the Union of Burma!
    China and Burma are close neighbors, connected by mountains and rivers, with a common border of more than 2,000 kilometers. The border residents of the two countries have always been very friendly, and have formed a "pauk-phaw" relationship as close as siblings since ancient times. Some of them are of the same ethnicity, such as the Dai and Shan, the Jingpo and Kachin, and the Kawa and Wa. Others live in neighboring villages and are as close as family. Relatives and friends visit each other without distinction. The Sino-Burmese border issue is a problem left over by history and is also a product of imperialist aggression policies. Since our two countries freed themselves from imperialist oppression and gained independence, especially after the two Prime Ministers jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in 1954 and took them as the guiding principles of the relations between the two countries, favorable conditions have been created for solving this problem. Our two governments have always cherished the traditional friendship between the two countries and safeguarded the fundamental interests of the independence of the two countries and Asian peace. Therefore, when solving the border issue, they have considered both the historical background and the current practical situation and have determined the principle of mutual understanding, mutual accommodation, and friendly consultation. Although there have been some temporary differences during the negotiation process due to various complex reasons of history, geography, ethnicity, and economy, the common desire of our two countries to peacefully resolve the border issue has not wavered as a result. On the contrary, both sides have made great efforts to eliminate these differences and finally reached a final agreement and signed the boundary treaty. Here, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, I would like to express my gratitude and respect to the Government of the Union of Burma, to Prime Minister U Nu, to General Ne Win, and to all Burmese friends who have contributed to the resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue and the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty!
    The signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty comprehensively and thoroughly resolves the complex issue that the people of China and Burma have been longing to resolve for decades, making the Sino-Burmese border, which stretches for more than 2,000 kilometers, a border of peace and friendship. This will not only enable the residents of the Sino-Burmese border area to enjoy peace and happiness, but also benefit the peaceful construction and friendly cooperation of the people of China and Burma. The Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty is a milestone in the further development of Sino-Burmese friendly relations, a shining example of friendly coexistence among the peoples of Asian countries, and a good example of solving boundary issues and other disputes between Asian countries.
    Friends, Comrades! While we are all so happy and so enthusiastically celebrating the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, a great joyous event, the imperialists and their followers are very unhappy about the reasonable resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue and the development of Sino-Burmese friendly relations. There is a small group of ill-intentioned people who, in order to promote their policy of aggression and expansion, are trying every possible means to undermine the unity of the Chinese and Burmese peoples. They are trying to sow discord. However, the development of the situation is completely contrary to their wishes, and their vicious plot to undermine Sino-Burmese friendly relations by using the border issue has failed shamefully. Today, we are here to warmly celebrate the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, warmly celebrate the new development of Sino-Burmese friendly relations, and warmly celebrate the victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This is the most powerful answer to them and the heaviest blow to them.
    The signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty once again proves that the peaceful foreign policy pursued by the Chinese government is unwavering. The Chinese government not only hopes to live in friendship with its neighbors, but also hopes to coexist peacefully with all countries that have the same aspirations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese people will continue to fight together with the Burmese people and all peace-loving people against aggression and for the defense of peace. We believe that as long as the people of the world further unite, support each other, and persevere in the struggle, the imperialist policies of aggression and war will surely be defeated. The people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the whole world will surely win independence, win progress, win peace, and win victory.
    The people of China and Burma should not only support each other in the struggle against colonialism and for the safeguarding of national independence, and in the cause of safeguarding peace in Asia and the world, but also support each other in developing their respective independent national economies. The Chinese people are holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and are striving to build a prosperous and strong socialist country. At the same time, we are also willing to see the Burmese people continue to achieve new achievements in construction, and we sincerely congratulate the Union of Burma on its increasingly prosperous and strong development.
    Finally, let us cheer:
    Long live the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty!
    Long live Sino-Burmese peace and friendship!
    Long live the kinship-like friendship between the people of China and Burma!
    Long live the great unity of the people of Asia and the world!
    Long live world peace!

    在首都各界人民庆祝中缅边界条约签订大会上
    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的吴努总理阁下，尊敬的奈温将军阁下，尊敬的缅甸贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    今天，中国首都北京各界在这里举行盛大的集会，庆祝中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦边界条约的签订。让我们对今年、中缅友好年的大喜事热烈祝贺吧！我们特别高兴的是，同我们一起参加这个庆祝大会的，有缅甸联邦总理吴努阁下，缅甸国防军总参谋长奈温将军阁下，缅甸联邦政府代表团，缅甸国防军副总参谋长昂季准将为首的中缅边界联合委员会缅方代表，缅甸国防军训练总监貌貌准将为首的军事友好代表团，缅甸国会议员吴妙为首的贸易代表团，苏敏上校为首的缅甸文化代表团，貌温中校为首的缅甸体育代表团和吴钦为首的缅甸新闻代表团三百多位贵宾。这些代表团包括了缅甸政府的高级官员，缅甸联邦党和缅甸民族团结阵线的政党代表，克钦邦和掸邦的领袖，以及缅甸军事、经济、文化、艺术、体育、新闻各界的知名人士。这是中缅友好历史上规模最大、人数最多、范围最广的一次友好活动。与此同时，住在中缅边界上的两国居民也在进行广泛而热烈的友好联欢。特别值得提起的是，缅甸政府还在签订中缅边界条约的昨天，通过我国政府所指定的官员，向中缅边界附近约一百万中国居民，赠送两千吨大米和一千吨食盐。这些都反映了中缅两国人民的深厚友谊，标志着中缅两国的友好关系达到了新的高潮。我谨代表中国人民和中国政府，在这里再一次向吴努总理阁下，奈温将军阁下和全体缅甸贵宾，并且通过你们，向缅甸人民和缅甸联邦政府，表示深切的感谢！
    中缅两国是紧密的邻邦，山连山，水连水，有着两千多公里长的共同边界。两国边民历来是十分友好的，自古以来就结成了亲如手足的“胞波”关系。他们有的是同一民族，如傣族和掸族，景颇族和克钦族，佧佤族和瓦族。有的是生活在邻近村寨，亲如一家。亲友来往，不分彼此。中缅边界问题是历史上遗留下来的问题，同时，也是帝国主义侵略政策的产物。自从我们两国摆脱了帝国主义的压迫，获得独立以后，特别是1954年两国总理共同创导了和平共处五项原则，并且以此为两国关系的指导原则之后，就为解决这个问题创造了有利的条件。我们两国政府又一贯珍视两国的传统友谊和维护两国独立和亚洲和平的根本利益，因而在解决边界问题的时候，既考虑历史背景，又考虑当前实际情况，确定了互谅互让和友好协商的方针。尽管在谈判过程中，由于历史的、地理的、民族的和经济的种种复杂原因，双方也有过某些暂时的分歧，但是，我们两国和平解决边界问题的共同愿望，并没有因此而有所动摇；相反地，我们双方为消除这些分歧，都做了很大的努力，终于达成了最后协议，签订了边界条约。在这里，我代表中国人民和中国政府，向缅甸联邦政府，向吴努总理阁下，奈温将军阁下，向所有对中缅边界问题的解决和中缅边界条约的签订作出贡献的缅甸朋友们，表示感谢和敬意！
    中缅边界条约的签订，全面地彻底地解决了几十年来中缅两国人民一直渴望解决的复杂问题，使长达两千多公里的中缅边界，成为和平友好的边界。这不仅使中缅边境的居民能够得到安宁和幸福，而且有利于中缅两国人民的和平建设和友好合作。中缅边界条约是中缅两国友好关系进一步发展的里程碑，是亚洲各国人民友好相处的光辉榜样，是亚洲各国之间解决边界问题和其他争端的良好范例。
    朋友们，同志们！当我们大家如此高兴、如此热烈地庆祝签订中缅边界条约这件大喜事的时候，帝国主义及其追随者却对中缅边界问题的合理解决和中缅友好关系的发展，感到很不高兴。有那么一小撮不怀好意的人，为了推行他们的侵略扩张政策，总是千方百计地破坏中缅人民的团结。他们力图进行挑拨离间。可是，事实的发展完全同他们的愿望相反，他们利用边界问题破坏中缅友好关系的恶毒阴谋是可耻地破产了。今天我们在这里热烈祝贺中缅边界条约的签订，热烈祝贺中缅友好关系的新发展，热烈祝贺和平共处五项原则的胜利，就是给予他们最有力的答复，也是给予他们最沉重的打击。
    中缅边界条约的签订，再一次证明了中国政府所执行的和平外交政策是坚定不移的。中国政府不仅希望同自己的邻邦友好相处，并且希望在和平共处五项原则的基础上同所有具有同样愿望的国家实行和平共处。中国人民将继续同缅甸人民和一切爱好和平的人民一起，为反对侵略、维护和平而斗争。我们相信，只要世界各国人民进一步团结起来，互相支持，坚持斗争，帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策是一定可以击败的。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民和全世界人民必将赢得独立，赢得进步，赢得和平，赢得胜利。
    中缅两国人民不仅在反对殖民主义和维护民族独立的斗争中，在维护亚洲和世界和平的事业中，是应该相互支持的；而且在发展各自的独立的民族经济方面，也是应该相互支援的。中国人民正在高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，为建设一个繁荣富强的社会主义国家而奋斗。同时，我们也愿意看到缅甸人民在建设中不断取得新的成就，并且衷心祝贺缅甸联邦日益走向繁荣富强。
    最后，让我们欢呼：
    中缅边界条约万岁！
    中缅和平友好万岁！
    中缅两国人民亲戚般的友谊万岁！
    亚洲和世界人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
