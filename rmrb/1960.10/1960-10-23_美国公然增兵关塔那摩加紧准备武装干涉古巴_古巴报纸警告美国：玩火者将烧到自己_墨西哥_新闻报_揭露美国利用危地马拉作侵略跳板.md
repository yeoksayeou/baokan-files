Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 22nd: The Cuban newspaper "Calle" published a commentary on the United States' renewed increase of troops at the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba, stating that U.S. imperialism is impatiently attempting to implement its conspiracy to invade Cuba. However, the Cuban people will not let any aggression against our homeland go unpunished.

The newspaper pointed out that those who try to deduce non-existent internal struggles in Cuba from thin air are wasting their time. The newspaper emphasized that "the people of all countries know that the Cuban people are closely united around the revolutionary government, and they know that any violation of peaceful life can only come from foreign countries using American ships and planes."

The newspaper said, "The whole world knows that we will resist and repel aggression. Our people are invincible, and in the struggle for freedom, we will receive the support of all socialist and neutral countries, and all countries that advocate peace. Imperialism is playing with fire, but it will burn its own fingers."

Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Washington news: The United States is openly continuing to increase troops in Guantanamo, which is another signal that U.S. imperialism is stepping up its conspiracy to militarily intervene in Cuba.

Marine Corps Commandant Shoup announced in Norfolk, Virginia, on the evening of the 20th that the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo in Cuba "has been reinforced." On the same day, Chief of Naval Operations Burke also said at a press conference in Miami Beach that the United States had "sufficient strength" in Guantanamo "and will use that strength if necessary." Miami Beach is in the southernmost part of the United States, and the United States has always directed and deployed armed intrusions and subversion activities against Cuba from there.

The number of U.S. troops stationed in Guantanamo was originally only several thousand, but it suddenly increased to 30,000 last May.

In addition to the U.S.'s own military deployments, according to a report by a Costa Rican bourgeois newspaper on the 20th, in order to carry out the plan for armed aggression against Cuba, the United States is also using its puppet regime in Guatemala to transport large quantities of aircraft and weapons to Guatemala, preparing to invade Cuba from there. The Costa Rican newspaper pointed out that "an invasion of Cuba could happen at any time," and the personnel under U.S. command preparing to invade Cuba have "made preparations and set the time for action" in order to attack Cuba.

While actively preparing for an armed attack on Cuba, the United States has also taken a series of hostile measures against Cuba in the economic and other fields. Following the U.S. government's announcement of an "embargo" on Cuba, the "National Committee for American Import and Export Policy," a powerful U.S. foreign trade organization, on the 21st submitted a proposal to Secretary of State Herter, advocating that the United States take boycott measures against Cuban goods exported to the United States. Leading figures in the U.S. political circles have also been frantically clamoring to overthrow the Cuban revolutionary regime, repeatedly. The current Vice President and Republican presidential candidate Nixon has, in a series of speeches, advocated that the United States implement a so-called "cordon sanitaire" against Cuba, and that the Cuban people "get rid" of the Castro regime.

According to Xinhua News Agency, 22nd, dispatch from TASS, Mexico City: The Mexican newspaper "News" revealed in an article that U.S. imperialism is using Guatemala as a springboard for aggression against Cuba, and that preparations for an armed attack on Cuba are being intensified there. The newspaper pointed out that the Guatemalan government has established two airports and two military camps in Retalhuleu Province, from where it receives weapons and ammunition transported via the Camalita Airport.

    古巴报纸警告美国：玩火者将烧到自己
    墨西哥“新闻报”揭露美国利用危地马拉作侵略跳板
    新华社哈瓦那22日电　古巴“街道报”就美国再次增加在古巴的海军基地关塔那摩的驻军发表评论说，美帝国主义正在迫不及待地企图实行侵略古巴的阴谋。但是，古巴人民将不会不加惩罚地放过对我们祖国的侵略。
    报纸指出，那些想从空气里得出一些并不存在的关于古巴内部斗争的企图是徒劳的。报纸强调说，“世界各国人民知道古巴人民紧密地团结在革命政府的周围，他们知道对和平生活的任何侵犯只能是来自利用美国舰只和飞机的外国”。
    报纸说，“全世界都知道我们将要抵抗并击退侵略。我国人民是不可战胜的，在争取自由的斗争中，我们将得到所有社会主义和中立国家以及一切主张和平的国家的支持。帝国主义正在玩火，然而，它将烧到它自己的指头。”
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：美国公然继续增兵关塔那摩，这是美帝国主义加紧阴谋武装干涉古巴的又一信号。
    美国海军陆战队司令休普20日晚上在弗吉尼亚州诺福克城宣布，美国在古巴的关塔那摩的海军基地“兵力已经加强”。同一天，美国海军作战参谋长伯克也在迈阿密海滩举行的记者招待会上说，美国在关塔那摩“有足够的力量”，“并且将在必要时使用这种力量”。迈阿密海滩在美国最南端，美国一直是从那里指挥和部署对古巴的武装侵入和颠覆活动的。
    美国在关塔那摩的驻军原来只有数千人，但是在去年5月骤然增加到三万人。
    除了美国自己的军事部署外，据哥斯达黎加资产阶级报纸20日报道，为了执行武装侵略古巴的计划，美国还正在利用它在危地马拉的傀儡政权，大量向危地马拉运送飞机和武器，准备从那里进犯古巴。哥斯达黎加报纸指出，现在“随时都可能发生对古巴的进犯”，美国指挥下的准备进犯古巴的人员，已经“作好了准备，定好了行动的时间”，以便进攻古巴。
    在积极准备武装进攻古巴的同时，美国还接连在经济等方面采取了敌视古巴的一连串措施。继美国政府宣布对古巴“禁运”以后，美国有势力的对外贸易组织“美国出入口政策全国委员会”21日又向国务卿赫脱提出了一个建议，主张美国对古巴输往美国的商品采取抵制措施。美国政界的首脑人物最近也在三番五次疯狂地叫嚷要推翻古巴革命政权。现任副总统、共和党总统候选人尼克松在接连发表的演说中鼓吹美国要对古巴实行所谓“瘟疫隔离”，要古巴人民“摆脱”卡斯特罗政权。
    据新华社22日讯　据塔斯社墨西哥城讯：墨西哥“新闻报”在一篇文章中揭露美帝国主义利用危地马拉作为侵略古巴的跳板，在那里，武装进攻古巴的准备工作正在加紧进行。报纸指出：危地马拉政府在雷塔卢勒奥省建立了两个飞机场和两个军营，从那里得到经由卡梅里塔机场运来的武器和弹药。
