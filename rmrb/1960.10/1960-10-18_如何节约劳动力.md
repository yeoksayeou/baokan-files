How to Save Labor

Editor's Note: On September 21st, this newspaper published a letter on page two to the commune party secretary, requesting everyone to share their experiences in saving labor. Here, we have selected letters from several communes.

Ideological Work Must Come First

The main measures taken by our commune party committee to promote the enthusiasm of commune members for labor and improve labor efficiency are to strengthen ideological education for commune members. Currently, after the increase in labor in the forefront of agricultural production, some commune members said: "Now that there are more people, we can relax a bit." Therefore, they are not paying close attention to farm work. When Han Zhanqun, secretary of the commune party committee, inspected the use of labor in production teams such as Shishan and Chawu, he found that a few production team cadres also believed that there was plenty of labor and that completing the "Three Autumns" work was not a problem, and there was a sense of complacency and relaxation. In response to these situations, the commune party committee promptly assisted grassroots party organizations in widely and deeply publicizing the important significance of "vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain," criticized complacency, commended the Yidu River production team, which had good labor allocation and was ahead of everything in farm work, and introduced their experience. The Taixia Production Team's party branch raised the topic of "How to vigorously develop agriculture and vigorously develop grain" and organized commune members to discuss it. Through discussion, commune members recognized that vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain is a long-term and arduous task. Currently, it is a busy season for agricultural affairs, and steel must be used on the blade, so all members of the team strive to exceed their quotas.

Tool Reform Gets Twice the Results with Half the Effort

Vigorously engaging in tool reform is the best way to save labor. The Dajindian Production Team of the Dajindian Management Area of our commune has a total of 219 livestock, but processing flour alone takes up more than 60 of them. In addition, more than 60 people have to be assigned to watch the mill and sift the flour. Using so much manpower and animal power to process flour inevitably weakens the strength to participate in field production.

The commune party committee believes that this situation must be changed quickly and decided that Lin Jinzhan, secretary of the party general branch of the management area, and Chen Zhanqing, secretary of the production team party branch, should be responsible for building a water mill using the Ying River water. Lin Jinzhan and Chen Zhanqing, together with Li Shuzhang and others, the well-known "water conservancy experts" of the management area, first repaired the steel mill and waterwheel, using a wooden purlin as the central axis and old screws for the joints. They only added six jin of iron parts and a steel mill head, spending four yuan, forty-seven fen, to build a water mill that can grind 1,800 jin of flour per day, freeing up 43 laborers and more than 30 livestock to directly participate in agricultural production.

Allocate Labor According to Weather and Land Conditions

We believe that to make the best use of everyone's abilities and improve labor efficiency, we must carefully calculate all farm work and labor. As the saying goes, "Don't be afraid of thousands of items, just be afraid of improper arrangements." Those who lead production must have a "number" in their minds for all farm work throughout the year. For an item of farm work, sending two people is tighter, and sending three people is looser, so two people should be sent. This not only saves labor, but also gives everyone a place to exert their strength when working, and they can also actively think of ways to work cleverly. This year, when repairing the canal, we originally planned to send 190 people to complete it in five days. Later, we helped each production team to calculate the details item by item and person by person, and as a result, we reduced 32 people and still completed the canal repair task on time.

To lead production well and save labor, we must also consider the weather and land conditions. To consider the weather, we must understand the temper of "Old Man Heaven"; to consider the land, we must know the laws of crop growth. Every year in summer, weeding in the fields is a troublesome task. In the summer, there is continuous rain, and weeds grow as soon as they are weeded, which takes a lot of labor to get rid of the weeds. This year, we found the rule that weeds grow quickly in the rainy season and are not easy to remove completely. Before the rainy season came, we organized commune members to weed. At this time, the weeds were tender and the sun was strong, and the weeds that were weeded quickly dried up. The whole team spent only ten days weeding once, and the work efficiency increased by nearly one time. This not only saved labor but also ensured the normal growth of crops.

### 如何节约劳动力

    如何节约劳动力
    编者按　9月21日本报二版发表了一封给公社党委书记的信，要求大家介绍节约劳动力的经验。这里，我们选登几个公社的来信。
    思想工作要先行
    我们公社党委发挥社员劳动积极性，提高劳动效率的主要措施，是加强对社员的思想教育工作。目前，农业生产第一线的劳动力增加以后，有的社员就说：“这回人多了，咱可以轻松轻松了。”因此，对农活抓的不紧。公社党委书记韩展群到史山、茶坞等生产队检查劳动力使用情况时，发现少数生产队干部，也认为劳动力多了，完成“三秋”工作不成问题，存在着麻痹松劲的情绪。针对这些情况，公社党委及时协助基层党组织，广泛深入地宣传“大办农业、大办粮食”的重要意义，批判了麻痹思想，表扬了劳动力支配得好，样样农活都赶在前面的一渡河生产队，并介绍了他们的经验。台下生产队党支部提出了“怎样大办农业、大办粮食”的题目，组织社员讨论。通过讨论，社员认清了大办农业、大办粮食是一项长期的、艰巨的任务。当前，正是农事繁忙的季节，有钢要使在刀刃上，因此，全队社员人人争取超过定额。

    改革工具事半功倍
    大搞工具改革，是节约劳动力的最好办法。我们公社大金店管理区大金店生产队，共有牲畜二百一十九头，可是加工磨面就占用了六十多头，此外，还要抽调六十多人看磨，罗面。用这么多的人力和畜力加工面粉，就必然削弱了参加田间生产的力量。
    公社党委认为必须迅速改变这种情况，决定由管理区党总支书记林金沾和生产队党支部书记陈占卿负责，利用颖河水，建设水磨。林金沾和陈占卿与管理区有名的“水利专家”李树章等人，首先修理好了钢磨和水轮，用了一根木檩作中轴，安装接头用的是旧螺丝，只新添了六斤铁货和一个钢磨头，化了四元四角七分钱，就建成了一盘水磨，每天能磨面一千八百斤，腾出了四十三个劳动力，三十多头牲口，直接参加农业生产。

    看天看地用劳力
    我们认为，要做到人尽其力，提高劳动效率，必须把各项农活和劳力计算好。常言说：“不怕千项万项，就怕安排不当。”领导生产的人，全年的各项农活，心中都要有个“数”，一项农活，派两个人紧一点，派三个人松一点，就应当派两个人，这样不光节省劳力，大家干活时也有使劲的地方，也能积极想办法巧干。今年修水渠的时候，我们原计划派一百九十个人，五天完成。后来我们帮助各生产小队逐项逐人算细账，结果减下了三十二个人，也照样按时完成了修渠的任务。
    要领导好生产，节约劳动力，还要看天看地。看天，要摸准“老天爷”的脾气；看地，要知道作物生长的规律。每年夏季，大田锄草是件麻烦事，夏季阴雨连绵，随锄随长，要费很多劳动力，才能把草锄净。今年，我们找到了杂草在雨季长得快，不容易除净的规律。在雨季到来以前，就组织社员锄草，这时候，草芽嫩，阳光强，锄下的草很快就晒死了。全队只用十天时间，就锄完了一遍草，工效提高将近一倍。既节省了劳力，又保证了庄稼正常生长。　河北省新乐县安香公社　段洛恩（附图片）
