　　Xinjiang People Launch "Winter Wheat Oversowing Campaign," Striving for Oversowing Upon Oversowing
　　Anhui Vigorously Grasps Autumn Sowing Quality, Shaanxi Utilizes Vacant Land to Expand Winter Wheat Planting

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 26th -- After basically completing the winter wheat planting plan, people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are launching a winter wheat oversowing campaign with the spirit of continuous revolution, striving to plant more and more. As of the 20th, the entire autonomous region has planted over 14 million mu of winter wheat, expanding the winter wheat planting area by more than 40% compared to last year.

The winter wheat oversowing campaign in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is a mass movement launched by all the people under the deep-rooted policy of the whole Party and the whole people engaging in agriculture and grain production. It is based on the experience of the people's communes in completing their planting plans ahead of schedule. This year, Xinjiang's winter wheat planting plan greatly exceeded last year's, with each rural laborer responsible for planting more than ten mu of winter wheat. The task is large, and the labor force is small. Since the summer harvest, the people's communes, from top to bottom and from bottom to top, have conscientiously summarized this year's wheat bumper harvest experience, implemented planting plans, vigorously reclaimed wasteland, accumulated fertilizer, and built small and medium-sized water conservancy projects, making preparations in all aspects. Since the beginning of autumn sowing, Party committee secretaries at all levels and tens of thousands of cadres have gone deep into production teams to strengthen leadership. All communes have concentrated 80% to 90% of their labor force and all available animal power and machinery into the front line of autumn sowing, implementing block alignment and concentrating forces for a crash sowing. Many communes also organized shock teams to carry out a one-stop race on the autumn stubble land of reaping and sowing as soon as it's ripe, which improved the sowing progress. Therefore, as early as the end of September and the beginning of October, a large number of communes had overfulfilled the winter wheat planting plan. Tuoli County, a semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area, planted more than 80,000 mu of winter wheat on newly reclaimed wasteland at the end of September, overfulfilling the plan and expanding the planting area more than three times compared to last year. The main winter wheat producing areas, such as the Ili, Bayingoleng, Kizilsu, and Changji Autonomous Prefectures and the Kashgar, Hotan, and Hami Special Districts, completed their original winter wheat planting plans about half a month before the frost and launched the oversowing campaign with great fanfare.

In the winter wheat planting, Party committees at all levels have conducted in-depth education on the thought of continuous revolution to encourage the masses, making the oversowing campaign surge wave after wave, both vigorously and solidly. Under the slogan of "Plant more, grow more, oversow upon oversow," more than 200,000 farmers in Hotan Special District mobilized overnight on the same day they completed the original planting plan, going all out to carry out the oversowing campaign, and adding oversowing tasks twice in the last five days. In the "Team Exceeds 100 Mu, Brigade Exceeds 1,000 Mu, Commune Exceeds 10,000 Mu" red flag competition campaign launched in Kashgar Special District, the daily sowing progress in early October reached 170,000 mu, one and a half times higher than during the initial sowing. Many communes and teams were oversowing again and again, and red flag units emerged in batches, oversowing 250,000 mu in six days.

In the winter wheat oversowing campaign, all regions and people's communes concentrated their superior forces to carry out high-efficiency labor movements in every possible way. Ten counties and cities directly under the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture concentrated 8,400 foreign plows and 30,000 draft horses. Most of the sowing machines were equipped with two shifts of people, who took turns sowing and resting, ensuring that people and animals had sufficient rest time and fully utilizing the effectiveness of the machinery. Many foreign plows reached more than 70 mu per day, and sowing machines reached more than 100 mu per day.

The communist large-scale collaboration of advanced helping backward and giving convenience to others, which was widely carried out between counties, communes, and teams, enabled all regions and every people's commune to complete their plans evenly in the oversowing competition. After completing the autumn sowing plan, Bachu County in Kashgar Special District supported the neighboring water-deficient Maigaiti County with all the water in the county, enabling some water-deficient communes in Maigaiti County to complete the oversowing plan.

Xinhua News Agency reported that Anhui has conscientiously implemented autumn planting standards, comprehensively improving the quality of autumn planting and laying the foundation for a balanced increase in summer harvest next year. The province's autumn planting is now advancing at a rate of one million mu per day, with 4 million laborers put into autumn planting every day. 50% of the more than 10 million mu of wheat already planted have emerged, and the seedlings are growing very well.

In order to implement the policy of planting more for more yield and high yield for more yield, and to improve the quality of autumn planting this year, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued several relevant instructions and requested the implementation of the "Several Opinions on Autumn Sowing Technology This Year" proposed by the Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, Party committees at all levels have formulated autumn planting technical measures and standards in light of local conditions. In order to further specify these standards, leading cadres at all levels from the county to the commune to the team have personally engaged in "command fields" and "model fields," and then organized cadres and masses to visit and promote them.

All localities have focused on rational close planting in autumn sowing. In order to better implement the "density" character in the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," many communes have summarized the past close planting situation and put forward new requirements. According to last year's experience, Subu Commune in Liu'an County this year takes ensuring a basic seedling of 200,000 plants per mu as the standard, changes the amount of seeds used according to different varieties and different sowing periods, and carries out fine tillage. This effectively guarantees a germination rate of over 97% and a strong green seedling color.

The focus of all localities on grasping the quality of sowing is placed on low-yield areas such as distant fields and thin land. The "command fields" of many leading cadres are built in low-yield fields. All localities have made proper arrangements for crop layout, fertilizer construction, and labor investment in general low-yield fields. For some particularly poor thin and infertile lands, all localities have focused on carrying out a series of renovation works on soil, drainage systems, etc.

Xinhua News Agency reported that while striving to complete the original autumn planting plan, all parts of Shaanxi Province are actively looking for vacant land in river beaches, barren mountains, and "ten sides" to expand the autumn planting area. According to the preliminary statistics of the Yan'an and Shangluo Special Districts and 14 counties and cities including Sanyuan, Dali, Weinan, and Pucheng, more than 500,000 mu have been planted in vacant land.

The planned area for autumn planting in Shaanxi Province this year has been expanded compared to last year. As of October 18, the area already planted accounted for 56.9% of the planned area, of which wheat had completed 65% of the planting plan. At present, all localities are rushing to harvest autumn fields and sowing in time to ensure the overfulfillment of the autumn planting plan. At the same time, all localities are actively looking for vacant land to expand the autumn planting area. According to the survey, there are many arable river beach lands on both sides of the Weihe River, Luohe River, Jinghe River, Wuding River, Yanhe River and other large and small rivers. Only the arable river beach lands on both sides of the Weihe River are more than one million mu; the potential of scattered lands on the sides of fields, graves, roads, villages, houses, fields, canals, wells, ponds, and reservoirs is also very large. As long as each production team increases planting by three, five, or ten mu, the province can increase the autumn planting area by hundreds of thousands of mu or even more; as for the barren land in mountainous areas, there is even more.

At present, the mass movement of demanding grain from river beaches and demanding grain from barren mountains has been universally launched on both sides of all rivers and in mountainous areas. Cadres at all levels take the lead in going down to the beaches and up to the mountains to reclaim land and sow wheat and summer coarse grains. Under the premise of not affecting soil erosion in mountainous areas, the members of the communes in the vast mountainous areas are also actively reclaiming wasteland to expand the autumn planting area.

All localities pay great attention to the sowing quality of these lands. Most of the lands that have been sown have been deep-plowed, soil disinfected, and treated with seed dressing. Some have also been applied with base fertilizer.

    多种冬麦多收粮　明年夏收看今秋
    新疆人民开展“冬麦超播运动”力争超播再超播
    安徽狠抓秋播质量　陕西利用空闲地扩种冬麦
    本报乌鲁木齐26日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各族农民在基本上完成冬麦播种计划以后，以不断革命精神开展冬麦超播运动，力争多播再多播。到20日为止，全自治区已实播冬麦一千四百多万亩，比去年扩大冬麦播种面积40％以上。
    新疆维吾尔自治区的冬麦超播运动，是全党全民大办农业大办粮食政策深入人心，各人民公社在提前完成播种计划的基础上开展起来的群众运动。今年，新疆播种冬麦的计划大大超过去年，平均每个农村劳动力担负冬麦播种面积在十亩以上，任务大，劳动力少。各人民公社从夏收以来，就从上到下，自下而上认真总结了今年小麦丰产经验，落实了播种计划，大力开垦荒地、积肥和兴修中小型水利，从各方面作好准备。秋播开始以来，各级党委书记和十几万名干部深入生产队加强领导。各公社都集中了80％至90％的劳动力和一切可以集中的畜力、机具投入秋播第一线，实行地块排队，集中力量突击抢播。许多公社还组织突击队，在秋茬地上开展随熟随收、随收随播一条龙竞赛，提高了播种进度。因此，早在9月底、10月初，就有大批公社超额完成冬麦播种计划，半农半牧区的托里县9月底就在开垦出的生荒地上种冬麦八万多亩，超额完成了计划，比去年扩大播种面积三倍多。主要冬麦产区伊犁、巴音郭楞、克孜勒苏、昌吉等自治州和喀什、和田、哈密等专区，都在霜降以前半月左右完成了原订的冬麦播种计划，千军万马地开展起超播运动。
    各级党委在冬麦播种中，深入进行不断革命思想的教育，鼓舞群众，使超播运动一浪高过一浪，既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实。和田专区在“多种更多种、超播再超播”的口号下，二十多万农民在完成原订的播种计划的当天，连夜动员，全力以赴开展超播运动，在最近五天中又连续两次追加了超播任务。喀什专区开展的“队超百亩、大队超千亩、公社超万亩”红旗竞赛运动中，10月上旬日播进度达到十七万亩，比初播时提高了一倍半，许多社、队都是一超再超，红旗单位成批涌现，六天中就超计划播种了二十五万亩。
    在冬麦超播运动中，各地区、各人民公社都集中优势兵力千方百计开展高工效运动。伊犁哈萨克自治州直属十个县、市集中了八千四百张洋犁和三万头耕马，大部分播种机都配备了两班人马，轮换播种，轮换休息，既保证了人、畜有充足的休息时间，又充分发挥了机具的效用，许多洋犁达到日犁七十多亩，播种机达到日播一百多亩。
    县与县、公社与公社、队与队之间广泛开展的先进帮后进、把方便送给别人的共产主义大协作，使各个地区和每个人民公社在超播竞赛中，都能均衡地完成计划。喀什专区的巴楚县在完成秋播计划以后，就将全县全部用水支援缺水的邻县麦盖提县，使麦盖提县一些缺水的公社也能完成超播计划。
    据新华社讯　安徽各地认真执行秋种标准，使秋种质量全面提高，为明年夏收的均衡增产打下了基础。现在全省秋种正以每天一百万亩的速度前进，每天投入秋种的劳力达四百万人，已种的一千多万亩小麦已有50％出苗，苗势都很好。
    为了贯彻多种多收和高产多收的方针，使今年秋种质量提高，中共安徽省委曾几次发出有关指示，并要求推行由安徽省农业科学研究所提出的“对今年秋播技术的几项意见”。各级党委根据省委指示，都针对当地具体情况制订了秋种技术措施和标准。为了使这些标准进一步具体化，从县、社到队，各级领导干部都亲自动手大搞“指挥田”“样子田”，然后组织干部、群众参观推广。
    各地在秋种中着重抓了合理密植。不少公社为了更好地贯彻农业“八字宪法”中的“密”字，总结了过去密植情况，并提出了新的要求。六安县苏埠公社根据去年的经验，今年以保证每亩有基本苗二十万株为标准，根据品种不同、播种期不同来变更用种量，并进行了精细整地。这就有效地保证了97％以上的出芽率，并且苗色旺绿。
    各地抓播种质量的重点，是放在远田薄地等低产地区。很多领导干部的“指挥田”都是建立在低产田中的。各地对一般低产田在作物布局、肥料建设、劳力投放等方面，都作了妥善安排。对一些特别差的薄田瘦地，各地都有重点地进行土壤、排水系统等一系列的改造工作。
    据新华社讯　陕西省各地在努力完成原订秋播计划的同时，积极向河滩、荒山和“十边”寻找空闲地，扩大秋播面积。根据延安、商雒两个专区和三原、大荔、渭南、蒲城等十四个县、市的初步统计，已在空闲地里播种了五十万多亩。
    陕西省今年秋播计划面积比去年扩大，到10月18日，已播种的面积占计划面积56.9％，其中小麦已完成播种计划65％。目前各地正在抢收秋田，抢时播种，保证超额完成秋播计划。同时，各地又积极寻找空闲地，扩大秋播面积。据调查，在渭河、洛河、泾河、无定河、延河及其它大小河流两岸宜耕的河滩地很多，仅渭河两岸宜耕的河滩地就在百万亩以上；地边、坟边、路边、村边、房边、场边、渠边、井边、塘边、水库边零星土地的潜力也很大，只要每个生产小队增种三、五亩，十来亩，全省就可以增加几十万亩以至更多的秋播面积；至于山区的荒地，那就更多了。
    目前，向河滩要粮、向荒山要粮的群众运动，已经在各河流两岸和山区普遍展开。各级干部带头下滩、上山，开垦土地，播种小麦和夏杂粮。广大山区的社员，在不影响山区水土流失的前提下，也积极开荒扩大秋种面积。
    各地都十分注意这些土地的播种质量。目前已经下种的土地，绝大部分进行了深翻、土壤消毒和药剂拌种，有的还施了底肥。（附图片）
