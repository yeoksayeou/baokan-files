    Accusations Against American Imperialism in Cantonese Songs (Part 2)

    The eighth song of "Suffering in Wooden House Confinement" writes: "Poverty plagues us with firewood and rice, borrowing money to go to Gold Mountain. Customs officers interrogate, making escape difficult, sent to Angel Island as prisoners. Arriving here, lamenting in dark rooms. The nation is weak, suffering much humiliation, treated like animals, abused and trampled upon."

    Reaching this song, it is truly a sorrowful lament. The depth of the pain illustrates how cruel and inhumane American imperialism was, treating Chinese people like animals, insulting, humiliating, trampling, and crushing them. Even discussing it now, sixty years later, it is infuriating. A song in "Heroes Struggle at the American Border" says: "Seeking a meager profit, leaving the impoverished homeland. Taking risks to go to the United States, encountering customs officers who interrogate you. If you forget something, you are sent to a desolate island. Heroes are truly useless here, unable to step beyond the boundary." The content is similar.

    A weak nation is truly difficult, overseas Chinese go to foreign lands. Detained for questioning, trapped in mountain rooms, one discrepancy in the statement leads to being tied to death. Never released, compatriots cry injustice. Determined to strictly prohibit return to Hong Kong, pitiful homeland in tears."

    Detained pending trial, information is blocked. A hundred kinds of depression in the heart, water and rice difficult to swallow. What can be compared, when can one go to town. Confined in a dark room, gasping silently, lamenting that our compatriots are treated like horses and cattle."

    The previous verses mention being sent to a desolate island, which is one outcome of detention. Here, it speaks of being sent back to Hong Kong, which is another outcome. If there is a third outcome, it is "dark room confinement," or dying there. "A hundred kinds of depression in the heart," although it also contains some fatalistic notions, the more active yearning is the hope that the motherland will become strong and have the opportunity for revenge.

    Arriving in America, imprisoned for many years. Countless twists and turns, former life not cultivated enough. Truly hateful, repeatedly bullied. Wishing for a strong nation to avenge the hatred, raising troops like in the Russo-Japanese War."

    This echoes the sentiment of "Jointly wishing our four hundred million compatriots, the Central Plains will be revitalized with great rivers and mountains" ("Celebrating the New Year in the Homeland"). Overseas Chinese, especially laborers, have recognized the ferocity of American imperialism, no longer harbor any illusions, and hope to return to the motherland. They are "confined under the American flag, their bodies like carrying heavy shackles. Wanting to return to China at all times, regrettably the road is long and difficult." They "have come to the borderlands, suffering the oppression of foreign devils. Traveling to the United States, the scenery still evokes nostalgia" ("Traveler Missing Home"). Their imagined American dreamscape is completely shattered. Because the song contains the phrase "Russo-Japanese War" (1904-05), it can be inferred that it was written around the time of the anti-American Chinese Exclusion Act movement in 1905. The whole song ends:

    "The room's walls are like iron barrels, strict barriers allow no wind to pass. Countless harsh rules cannot be exhausted, constantly abused, a myriad of sorrows. Worrying, no peace for sleeping and eating. Although there are no shackles, the hidden punishments are severe, tears filling clothes, heart full of sadness."

    Looking at the whole song, it can be said to be an extremely painful indictment written by the person involved, filled with blood and tears, accusing the ferocious American imperialism of being barbaric, vicious, and inhumane. This is what American imperialism calls "civilization." There are some difficult-to-understand parts in the lyrics, possibly due to local dialect or errors in transcription or typesetting, and because there are no other versions, they cannot be corrected.

    As for the songs in "Gold Mountain Song Collection" that generally reflect overseas Chinese or Chinese workers, they are mostly words of mutual longing between those at home and abroad. For example, a woman at home misses her husband: "My husband travels to Cuba, causing my heart to constantly worry. Mountains and rivers remotely separate, ocean waves are like mountains, truly. Fearing for you, carrying worries is difficult to put down. Fame and fortune are not sought, wishing my husband to return home soon" ("Someone Missing a Traveler"). For example, a man abroad misses his family: "Often dreaming of the Tang scenery, waking with eyes open. Dreaming of returning to Xinning, dreaming of wife, children, and village wells. The dream is not clear, still dreaming of the beautiful scene. Each dream still accuses the heart of being sacred, when will I dream of the family" ("Traveler Missing Home"). The "Tang" mentioned here is China. The lyrics are also simple and sincere, in line with the situation at the time.

    控诉美帝国主义的粤歌（下）
    《木屋拘囚吃尽苦》第八首歌写道：家贫柴米患，贷本来金山。关员审问脱身难，拨往埃仑如监犯。到此间，暗室长嗟叹。国弱被人多辱慢，俨然畜类任摧残。
    发展到这一首，真是悲歌当哭了。沉痛的深度，说明了美帝国主义是怎样的残酷、惨无人道，视中国人如畜类，而侮之、辱之、践之、踏之。就是六十年后的现在重谈，也要令人发指。《英雄难过美国关》里有一首说：“欲觅蝇头利，穷乡没作置。乘范履险走花旗，遇着税员盘诘汝。稍忘记，拨禁荒岛里。好汉真无用武地，不能一步越雷池”。内容正相类。
    国弱真难讲，华侨到异邦。阻留候审困山房，供一不符案死绑。总唔放，同胞呼冤枉。志在严禁拨返港，可怜梓里泪汪汪。
    羁留名审候，信息不通透。百般抑郁在心头，水饭一些难入口。乜能较，几时得上埠。暗室监禁气莫哮，嗟我同胞作马牛。
    前面说拨往荒岛，是候审的一种结果，这里说拨返香港，又是另一种结果，如果还有第三种结果，那就是“暗室监禁”，或者死在那里了。“百般抑郁在心头”，虽说也有些宿命的观念，更积极的向往，却是希望祖国强盛，有机会报仇。
    来美经抵步，被困年有多。个中万折又千磨，前世唔修折太堕。真可恶，屡逢佢欺负。但愿国强仇报补，兴兵恰似日战俄。
    也是“共祝同胞四万万，中原振奋大江山”（《梓里贺新年》）的意思。华侨，特别是华工，已认识到美帝国主义的凶恶，不再存任何幻想，希望回归祖国了。他们“羁身花旗下，身如荷重枷。无时不欲返中华，可惜路遥难策马”。他们“自到边疆地，受尽番奴欺。天涯走马至花旗，触景依然怀故里”（《远客思乡》）他们意想中的美国的梦景完全破碎了。由于歌里有“日战俄”（1904—5）语，可推见写作的年代，是在1905年反美华工禁约运动发生的时候。最后结束全歌：
    室板如铁桶，严关不漏风。百般苛例讲唔穷，朝夕被凌悲万种。忧忡忡，寝膳遑安用。虽无枷锁阴刑重，泪满衣裳闷满胸。
    统观全歌，可以说是一篇极其沉痛的，出自当事人之手的，血泪满纸的控诉书，控诉凶恶的美帝国主义，是怎样的野蛮、恶毒以及惨无人道。这就是美帝国主义之所谓“文明”。歌词里有一些难以理解的地方，可能是土语的关系，也可能由于传钞或排版的舛误，因没有其他本子，无法订正。
    至《金山歌集》里一般反映华侨或华工的歌，大都是海内外互相怀念之词。如女的在国内怀念男的：“我郎游古巴，令妾心常挂。山川遥阻隔烟霞，海浪如山言非假。代君怕，担愁难放下。名利唔（不）求罢了罢，愿郎早日转回家”（《有人怀念天涯客》）。如男的在海外怀念家人：“常梦回唐景，梦完眼睛睁。梦返梦去到新宁，梦妻梦儿梦村井。梦未清，再梦仍美境。每梦尚诬心火圣，几时梦得到家庭”（《远客思乡》）。这里说的“唐”就是中国。歌词也很朴素真挚，符合当时情况。
