Grasp Vehicle Repair, Promote High Transportation Output
承德市 High Vehicle Integrity Rate, Continuous Increase in Freight Volume

　　(Reported from Tianjin on the 19th of this month) The automobile transportation department of Chengde City, Hebei Province, in the production increase and economy campaign, has been grasping both production and maintenance, keeping vehicles in good condition, and greatly improving transportation capacity. The total freight volume in late September increased by 16% compared with mid-September, among which the ore transportation volume was higher every ten-day period, increasing by 21% in mid-September compared with early September, and by another 25% in late September compared with mid-September.
　　In Chengde City, about half of the smelting materials rely on automobile transportation. In recent years, many new vehicles have been added. After some automobiles implemented double-shift transportation, many new drivers and new maintenance workers were added, whose driving operation and maintenance skills were not high. In addition, many automobiles transporting ore and coal travel on rugged mining area roads, making them prone to breakdowns. The Chengde Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to ensure a higher vehicle integrity rate and meet the needs of a substantial increase in steel production, called on the employees of the highway transportation system to carry out a production increase and economy campaign with the theme of loving vehicles, loving teams, and loving oil. The automobile transportation department mobilized employees to conduct discussions on the relationship between production and maintenance, and calculated task accounts, vehicle accounts, and vehicle integrity rate accounts, so that employees further realized that to improve production, it is necessary to strengthen automobile maintenance and promote production through maintenance. On this basis, the leading cadres of the Transportation Bureau Party Committee went deep into workshops, work sections, and driving teams, and summarized the advanced driving operations, rapid maintenance, and driving safety experiences created during the Great Leap Forward together with the employees, and promoted them comprehensively in sets. They also addressed the situation of some new drivers having a lot of book knowledge but little practical experience, and adopted the method of leading cadres being responsible for teams and groups, old workers being responsible for new workers, masters being responsible for apprentices, taking responsibility for teaching, learning, tasks, and vehicle integrity rates to improve the operating skills of new drivers.
　　The transportation department of this city also adopted a method of combining routine maintenance and professional maintenance. On the one hand, it increased professional maintenance teams in each automobile team to improve maintenance quality and shorten maintenance time. On the other hand, it strengthened the ideological education of drivers, changed the method of simply relying on maintenance plants to maintain vehicles, and implemented a routine maintenance system. Now, most drivers can do the "three checks" (check before driving, check after returning to the depot, and check midway), and conscientiously check screws and parts from the engine to the chassis, from the top to the bottom of the car, and repair them as soon as they break down, greatly improving the vehicle integrity rate. In the car loving campaign in the past two months or so, more than 210 car loving pacesetters and more than 20 advanced groups have emerged in the city. The workers said that they can't eat enough if the car isn't repaired, and they can't sleep well if the car is stopped for a day.
　　Increasing the production of spare parts, improving repair technology, shortening the vehicle's repair time in the factory, and turning broken vehicles into good vehicles as soon as possible are also important links in strengthening vehicle maintenance. The automobile repair departments of this city have carried out technical innovation and technical revolution on a large scale, changing manual car lifting to pneumatic crane car lifting, visual inspection to instrument inspection, and manual cleaning to automated cleaning, greatly accelerating the speed of disassembly, repair, and assembly. In order to ensure the timely supply of spare parts, the city has set up a parts manufacturing workshop in the repair plant, and also organized 23 factories to produce spare parts and repair vehicles for the automobile repair department. Now, many spare parts can be solved in time by themselves, shortening the repair time in the factory. In the past, it took 25 days for the city's automobile repair plant to overhaul an automobile, but now it has been shortened to one to two days, and the repair quality has also been greatly improved.

    抓车辆维修　促运输高产
    承德市汽车完好率高，运货量不断增加
    本报天津19日电　河北省承德市汽车运输部门在增产节约运动中，既抓生产，又抓维修保养，使车辆经常处于完好状态，大大提高了运输能力。9月下旬货运总量比中旬提高16％，其中矿石运量一旬比一旬高，中旬比上旬提高21％，下旬又比中旬提高25％。
    承德市占半数左右的冶炼物资靠汽车运输。近年来，新车增加很多；一部分汽车实行双班制运输以后，增加了很多新驾驶员和新保修工人，他们的驾驶操作和维修保养技术水平不高，而很多运矿石运煤的汽车，又行驶在崎岖的矿区道路上，很容易坏车。中共承德市委为保证有更高的完好车率，适应钢铁生产大幅度增长的需要，号召公路运输系统职工开展以爱车、爱队、爱油为内容的增产节约运动。汽车运输部门发动职工就生产和维修保养的关系问题进行了鸣放辩论，算了任务账、车辆账、汽车完好率账，使职工进一步认识到要提高生产必须加强汽车维修保养，以维修保养促进生产。在这个基础上，运输局党委的领导干部，深入车间、工段、行车小组，同职工一起总结在大跃进中创造的先进驾驶操作、快速保养、行车安全等方面的经验，并搭配成套，进行了全面推广。他们还针对一些新驾驶员书本知识多、实际操作经验少的情况，采取了领导干部包队包组、老工人包新工人、师傅包徒弟的包教、包学、包任务、包车辆完好率的办法，提高新驾驶员的操作技术。
    这个市的运输部门还采取例行保养和专业保养相结合的办法，一面在各汽车队增设专业保养组，提高保养质量，缩短保养时间，一面加强驾驶员的思想教育，改变单纯依靠保养厂保养车辆的办法，实行例行保养制度。现在大多数司机都能作到“三检”（开车前检查、回库后检查、中途检查），认真负责地从引擎到底盘，从车上到车下，逐个对螺丝、部件进行检查，随坏随修，大大提高了车辆完好率。全市在最近两个多月的爱车运动中，涌现出二百一十多名爱车标兵和二十多个先进小组。工人们说，车子没修好吃饭吃不饱，车要停一天睡觉也不安。
    增加配件生产，提高修配技术，缩短车辆在厂停修时间，尽快地把坏车变成好车，也是加强车辆维修保养的重要环节。这个市汽车修配部门，大搞技术革新和技术革命，把人力架车改为风动起重机架车，视力检验改为仪表检验，手工清洗改为自动化清洗，大大加快了拆卸、修理和装配速度。为保证配件的及时供应，这个市在修配厂内专设了制件车间，还组织了二十三个工厂为汽车修配部门生产配件和修理车辆。现在，很多配件自己都能及时解决，缩短了在厂停修时间。市汽车修配厂过去大修一台汽车需要二十五天，现在缩短到一到两天，修配质量也有很大提高。
