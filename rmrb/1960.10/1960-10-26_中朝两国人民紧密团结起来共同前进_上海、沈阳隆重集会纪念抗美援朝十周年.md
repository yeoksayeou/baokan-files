Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th: Over two thousand people from all walks of life in Shanghai held a grand rally this morning to solemnly commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

    Ke Qingshi, the Mayor of Shanghai; Cao Diqiu and Zhao Zukang, the Deputy Mayors; Liu Shuzhou, Liu Jingji, Shen Tilan, Chen Wangdao, and Hu Juewen, the Vice Chairmen of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Shi Ximin, Zhong Min, and Wu Yaozong, the Vice Chairmen of the Shanghai Federation; Wang Bicheng, Gao Zhirong, and Jiang Tengjiao, the leaders of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai; and the heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations, as well as former combat heroes of the Volunteers and family members of Volunteer martyrs, attended the rally.

    Li Kuanyong, the Consul General of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Shanghai, and the consular staff of other socialist countries in Shanghai were also invited to attend the commemorative rally.

    At 9:00 AM, Ke Qingshi and others ascended the rostrum amidst the music of "The Song of the Volunteers." Shi Ximin, the Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation, delivered a report. After discussing the great significance of the victory achieved by the Chinese and Korean armies in the Korean War, Shi Ximin said that the governments of China and North Korea have consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, consistently advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and consistently strived for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the peaceful settlement of international disputes; however, U.S. imperialism has consistently adhered to its policies of aggression and war. After listing the various criminal acts of aggression committed by U.S. imperialism since the Korean armistice, he said that we must continue to maintain a high degree of vigilance, unite the forces of the people of all countries, and deal a powerful blow to U.S. imperialism.

    Speaking of the unbreakable friendship forged in blood by the Chinese and Korean peoples, Shi Ximin said that the people of Shanghai, like the people of the whole country, will unite even more closely with the fraternal Korean people to develop our common cause, support each other, and advance together. Together with the people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and together with the peace-loving people of the world, we will fight to the end to completely smash the aggression and war policies of U.S. imperialism and to defend world peace.

    Li Kuanyong, the Consul General of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Shanghai, also spoke at the meeting.

    The speeches of Shi Ximin and Li Kuanyong were repeatedly interrupted by warm applause. After the meeting, the film "Witness to History" was shown.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th: Over two thousand people from all walks of life in Shenyang held a grand rally today at the Liaoning Provincial People's Assembly Hall to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

    Li Huang, the Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the President of the Liaoning Provincial Branch of the China-Korea Friendship Association; Qiu Youwen, the Vice Governor of Liaoning Province; Jiao Ruoyu, the First Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China; Zhu Weiren, the Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chairman of the Shenyang Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace; Zhang Xuexuan, the Vice Chairman of the Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Zhang Jizhong, the Vice Mayor of Shenyang; and the heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations in the province and city, attended today's rally.

    Also attending the rally were Lieutenant General Zeng Shaoshan, the leader of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shenyang; Major General He Qingji, the Commander of the Liaoning Military Region; and former heroes and meritorious individuals of the Volunteers.

    The conference began at 2:00 PM. Zhu Weiren, the Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chairman of the Shenyang Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, in his speech, paid tribute on behalf of the people of Shenyang to the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army, and to the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, the former commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers. He said that the great victory of the Chinese and Korean peoples in resisting U.S. imperialist aggression has set a glorious example for the people of all countries in dealing with imperialism. After listing the aggressive crimes of the U.S. invading army in South Korea, such as increasing its troop strength, illegally transporting a large number of new weapons and atomic weapons, and constantly conducting large-scale atomic warfare exercises and so-called "imaginary war" exercises near the ceasefire line, Zhu Weiren said, "All of this clearly tells us that the war-mongering U.S. imperialism is determined not to lay down its butcher knife. The provocative activities of the United States in Korea cannot but arouse the serious attention of the peoples of China and Korea."

    Zhu Weiren emphasized: "China and North Korea are as interdependent as lips and teeth, and as closely connected as flesh and blood. The friendship forged in blood by the peoples of China and North Korea in the common struggle against U.S. aggression will be further consolidated and developed. The Chinese people will always unite closely with the Korean people to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and make great contributions to the development of our common cause."

    Zhu Weiren's speech was met with warm applause. After the meeting, the movie "On the 38th Parallel" was shown.
