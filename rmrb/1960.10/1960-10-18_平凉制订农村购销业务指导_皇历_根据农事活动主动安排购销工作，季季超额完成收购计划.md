    From our Lanzhou dispatch on the 17th: The commercial departments of Pingliang City, Gansu Province, have compiled a rural commercial purchasing and marketing guidance "almanac" based on the characteristics of the many types, large output, uneven distribution, and strong seasonality of agricultural and sideline products. Carrying out rural purchasing and marketing activities according to this "almanac" makes the work proactive and flexible. In the first three quarters of this year, the procurement plans for agricultural and sideline products were completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the targets every season. During the same period, in conjunction with procurement, over 52,700 larger agricultural implements and over 440,000 smaller tools and utensils were supplied to agriculture, exceeding the plan by more than two times, along with over 380,000 kilograms of fertilizers and pesticides.
    The rural commercial purchasing and marketing guidance "almanac" arranges the main content of monthly production, procurement, supply, processing, and submission according to the lunar calendar's 24 solar terms and the production and market supply of various agricultural and sideline products. "Production" refers to organizing production and cultivating sources of goods; "Procurement" refers to purchasing personnel going to the countryside for procurement; "Supply" refers to bringing various production tools, fertilizers, pesticides, and daily necessities to the countryside for supply during procurement work; "Processing" refers to organizing communes, production teams, and relevant factories and workshops to process products locally; "Submission" refers to promptly submitting the purchased products to the state.
    In specific arrangements, for example, in January (lunar December), the solar terms are "Minor Cold" and "Major Cold." This period is the preparation period for spring sowing of various cash crops, and it is also a period when the processing and submission of various raw materials for light industry are relatively concentrated. Therefore, the guidance "almanac" stipulates: the main content of organizing production is: assisting communes and production teams to arrange the planting area of ​​spring vegetables, hemp, and flue-cured tobacco, preparing seeds and fertilizers, stocking up on raw materials such as bamboo and wood, and inspecting the processing progress of flax, flue-cured tobacco, fiber, and oil; in terms of procurement, focusing on hemp, flax, wild fiber, starch, oil, live pigs, fresh eggs, casings, waste products, and other small items; in terms of supply, focusing on supplying commune members with various daily necessities for the Spring Festival; in terms of processing, based on the requirements of the upcoming Spring Festival and spring plowing production, producing bamboo and wood agricultural implements, cages, harrows, and wood, lime, bricks, and tiles for construction, as well as vermicelli, meat, seasonings, candies, pastries, etc. for commune members to celebrate the Spring Festival; at the same time, submitting the key products acquired and processed to the state.
    This rural commercial purchasing and marketing guidance "almanac" was compiled by the Pingliang City commercial department by summarizing several years of practical work experience and printed into a booklet for distribution to various communes, production teams, shops, and purchasing personnel. After the implementation of this "almanac," the phenomenon of no focus in procurement in the past and sometimes the loss of products was changed. January is the season for hemp to go on the market. The city's rural commercial purchasing departments took hemp procurement as the center and organized 20,000 people to rush to purchase, recovering more than 160,000 catties of hemp in one day, and at the same time, dispatched special personnel to bundle, package, and submit them to the state. In this month, the commercial department also organized 35 commune- and team-run factories and production teams across the city to collect raw materials and manufacture small tools such as handles, cages, harrows, and carrying poles, making tool production ahead of spring plowing production. After the "Qingming" Festival, it is the season for harvesting the first cashmere and wool. According to the guidance "almanac," commercial purchasing personnel went deep into the production teams and worked with the breeders to grab cashmere and shear wool, recovering more than 55,000 catties of wool and cashmere in half a month, 1.2 times more than in the same period last year.
    The commercial department of Pingliang City also adopted the method of focusing on key areas, key products, and key periods in accordance with the spirit of this "almanac." In terms of regions, planning the live pigs and sheep of Jinghe and Anguo communes, the melons and vegetables of Kongtong commune, the hemp of Huating commune, the medicinal materials, walnuts, live sheep, and fresh eggs of Shenyu commune, and the honey of Caofeng and Dazhai communes as the focus of procurement; in terms of the seasonality of procurement, determining that regular procurement focuses on pigs, cattle, sheep, and animal products, and seasonal procurement focuses on daylilies, peppercorns, fennel, hemp, flax, walnuts, pears, fresh eggs, almonds, melon seeds, honey, etc. In this way, purchasing personnel are more aware of the situation.

    平凉制订农村购销业务指导“皇历”
    根据农事活动主动安排购销工作，季季超额完成收购计划
    本报兰州17日电　甘肃省平凉市商业部门根据农副土特产品生产的种类多、产量大、分布不均、季节性强的特点，编出农村商业购销指导“皇历”。根据这个“皇历”进行农村购销活动，工作主动灵活，今年前三个季度，每季都提前超额完成了农副土特产品的采购计划，同时期内，结合采购为农业供应了各种较大型农具五万二千七百多件，小型工具和用具四十四万多件，超过计划两倍多，化肥和农药三十八万多公斤。
    农村商业购销指导“皇历”，根据农历二十四个节气各种农副产品的生产和上市量，安排了每月产、购、供、加、缴的主要内容。“产”是组织生产，培植货源；“购”是采购人员下乡采购；“供”是在收购工作中，带着各种生产工具、化肥、农药和生活用品，下乡供应；“加”是组织公社、生产队和有关工厂、工场，就地加工产品；“缴”是把采购的产品及时上缴给国家。
    在具体安排上，例如1月份（农历十二月）的节气是“小寒”和“大寒”，这个时期正是各种经济作物春播准备时期，也是收购的各种轻工业原料加工、上缴比较集中的时期。因此，指导
  “皇历”中规定：组织生产的主要内容是：协助公社、生产队安排春菜、大麻、烤烟播种面积，准备籽种、肥料，储备竹、木等原材料，检查亚麻、烤烟、纤维和油料的加工进程；采购方面，着重抓大麻、亚麻、野生纤维、淀粉、油料、生猪、鲜蛋、肠衣、废品和其他小宗产品；供应方面，着重供应社员过春节用的各种生活用品；加工方面根据春节和春耕生产即将到来的要求，生产竹木农具、笼筐、耱和建筑用的木材、石灰、砖瓦，社员过春节用的粉条、肉类、调料、糖果、糕点等；同时把收购、加工的重点产品上缴给国家。
    这个农村商业购销指导“皇历”，是平凉市商业部门总结了几年来的实际工作经验编制出来的，并且编印成册，发给各公社、生产队以及商店和采购人员。这个“皇历”执行以后，改变了过去收购无重点，有时产品失收的现象。1月份是大麻上市时期，全市农村商业采购部门就以收购大麻为中心，组织了两万人突击收购，一天内即收回大麻十六万多斤，并在收购同时，抽出专人分点整扎、包装，上缴给国家。在这一个月，商业部门还根据农事不太繁忙的特点，组织全市三十五个社、队办工厂和生产队配合，采集原料，制造把杖、笼筐、耱、抬扛等小型工具，使工具生产走在了春耕生产的前面。“清明”节后是收获第一槎羊绒、羊毛的季节，商业采购人员根据指导“皇历”，深入生产队，和饲养员一起抓羊绒、剪羊毛，半个月内收回羊毛和羊绒五万五千多斤，比去年同期多收一点二倍。
    平凉市商业部门还根据这个“皇历”的精神，采取抓重点地区、抓重点产品、抓关键时期的办法。在地区方面，规划泾河、安国两个公社的生猪活羊，崆峒公社的瓜果蔬菜，华亭公社的大麻，神峪公社的药材、核桃、活羊、鲜蛋，草峰、大寨两个公社的蜂蜜等产品为收购的重点；在收购的季节性方面，确定经常性收购以猪、牛、羊、畜产品为主，季节性收购以黄花、花椒、小茴香、大麻、亚麻、核桃、梨、鲜蛋、杏仁、瓜子、蜂蜜等为主。这样，使采购人员更加心中有数。（附图片）
