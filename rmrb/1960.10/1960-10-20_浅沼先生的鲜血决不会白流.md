    Mr. Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, was unfortunately murdered by a fascist thug on the 12th of this month while delivering a campaign speech in Tokyo. Mr. Asanuma's murder is a great loss to Japan's patriotic and democratic forces. The Japan Socialist Party has decided to hold a funeral for Mr. Asanuma today. The "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," composed of more than 140 Japanese political parties and organizations, has also decided to hold its 23rd national unified action against the U.S.-Japan military alliance today in advance to protest the murder of Mr. Asanuma Inejiro by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. In this national unified action, the Japanese people, in addition to continuing to oppose the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan military alliance, also resolutely demand the total resignation of the Ikeda government, which is responsible for the murder of Asanuma Inejiro. The Chinese people express their deep condolences for the assassination of Mr. Asanuma, extend their sincere sympathy to Mr. Asanuma's family, and express their utmost indignation at the bloody atrocities of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries in murdering Mr. Asanuma. The Chinese people resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance and demanding severe punishment for the real murderers of Mr. Asanuma.
    Mr. Asanuma was an outstanding patriotic statesman of Japan. In the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, Mr. Asanuma was an active fighter and always stood at the forefront of the movement against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. He repeatedly pointed out that the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is an aggressive military alliance and that the Japanese people must fight for the abolition of this treaty. Until a few minutes before his murder, Mr. Asanuma was strongly condemning the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and demanding that Japan become a completely independent country. He told the audience with fervor: "The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty issue is the most important issue for Japan. Because the government forcibly revised the Security Treaty, Japan, which has suffered the hardship of stationing foreign troops for fifteen years, will have to allow the U.S. military to use its territory for another ten years. This is an unusual situation unprecedented in Japanese history." He emphasized that "in order to become a completely independent country, Japan should demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops and the return of all areas occupied by the United States to Japan. In order to get rid of the U.S. occupation, Japan should become a neutral country." Mr. Asanuma's voice before his death reflected the strong will of the broad masses of the Japanese people to defend national independence and safeguard national dignity.
    Mr. Asanuma was also a respected friend of the Chinese people. He consistently opposed the Japanese reactionary government's policy of following the United States, antagonizing China, creating "two Chinas," and obstructing the normalization of relations between China and Japan, and made unremitting efforts to promote friendship between the people of China and Japan and to strive for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. In 1957 and 1959, Mr. Asanuma led delegations from the Socialist Party to visit our country twice, leaving a deep impression on the Chinese people and making a significant contribution to strengthening the friendly cooperation between the people of China and Japan in their common struggle. Until the moment he was assassinated, Mr. Asanuma was still loudly advocating that "there is only one China, and Taiwan is a part of China. Japan must normalize its relations with China as soon as possible." Mr. Asanuma's remarks represented the strong desire of the Japanese people to be friendly with China, and the Chinese people will always cherish and respect this loyal friend.
    Mr. Asanuma not only devoted himself to the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship but also made positive contributions to the cause of defending Far Eastern and world peace and developing the unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa. Mr. Asanuma advocated establishing a Far Eastern collective security system based on the conclusion of non-aggression treaties between Japan, China, the Soviet Union, and the United States to replace Japan's military alliance with the United States, and fully supported Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal for Asian and Pacific countries to sign a non-aggression peace convention to build this region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Mr. Asanuma, regardless of the intimidation and threats of U.S. imperialism, repeatedly pointed out: "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Japan and China," and "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Asian people." He also believed that the basic issue in maintaining Far Eastern peace is, first and foremost, the withdrawal of U.S. troops from their bases in Okinawa and other parts of Japan, Taiwan of China, South Korea, and the Philippines. Although U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II had extremely arrogantly demanded that Mr. Asanuma retract his accusations against U.S. imperialism, Mr. Asanuma refused this unreasonable demand and adhered to a righteous stance.
    Mr. Asanuma was assassinated on the podium he used to expose and attack the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, precisely at the moment when he was loudly calling for Japan's independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. All this was not accidental. This is a serious signal that the U.S.-Japan reactionaries are launching a new offensive against the Japanese people, and it is part of the whole conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to attack the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and other patriotic and democratic forces in Japan on the eve of the Japanese general election.
    In the past year and a half, under the joint leadership of the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and other patriotic and democratic forces in Japan, the Japanese people have launched twenty-two consecutive national unified actions against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, heavily striking the war plans of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the steps to revive Japanese militarism. Therefore, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries have tried every means to launch an offensive against the Japanese patriotic and democratic forces and the Japanese people, attempting to undermine the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic movement. The Ikeda government, which succeeded the notorious Nobusuke Kishi, had already begun clamoring in September to "try" those who participated in the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle in mid-October; at the end of September, the Tokyo police authorities openly prosecuted Mr. Minoru Tanaka, the secretary-general of the Japanese "National Council to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" and a member of the Socialist Party's Diet, and two other cadres, attempting to attack the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. On the 11th of this month, the police department of the Ikeda government even convened a meeting of national police chiefs to deploy police in various places to intensify the suppression of democratic forces on the eve of the general election. The director-general of the Ikeda government's police department, Kashiwamura, openly clamored for "effective crackdowns" on democratic forces during the election campaign.
    At the same time, in order to implement the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries are making every effort to accelerate the policy of reviving Japanese militarism, making Japan an accomplice of U.S. imperialism in its aggression against Asia. In the short period of three months since the establishment of the Ikeda government, it has decided to increase Japan's direct military spending for the next year to more than 200 billion yen and is plotting to jointly establish a joint operations headquarters with the U.S. military after the Japanese general election, strengthen the Japanese army's nuclear war preparations, and accelerate the planning to revise the Japanese constitution and the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law," actively preparing to increase the number of police and modernize police equipment. For the same purpose, the Ikeda government, under the cover of beautiful rhetoric, has also begun to implement a series of reactionary measures, such as high prices and low wages, to launch an offensive against the living rights of the Japanese working people, shifting the huge burden of military spending onto the Japanese people, which cannot but further sharpen the contradictions between the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the Japanese people.
    Since the end of the war, there has been a struggle between two roads between the Japanese people and the U.S.-Japan reactionaries: whether Japan is independent or subordinate to the United States, whether it is peace or war, whether it is democracy or military dictatorship, whether it is neutral or becomes a member of the U.S. aggressive bloc and an accomplice of the United States in launching a new war. These are irreconcilable struggles between the broad masses of the Japanese people and U.S. imperialism and its agents, and they are struggles that determine the fate of Japan. Although Mr. Asanuma's patriotic and just struggle did not exceed the scope stipulated by the current Japanese constitution, because it reflected the Japanese people's desire for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, he became a thorn in the side of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. Therefore, immediately after Mr. Asanuma was assassinated, United Press International openly clamored that "Asanuma has long been a thorn in the side of the Japanese government." This is the most obvious self-exposure of the American reactionaries. Mr. Asanuma was the first Japanese patriotic politician to be killed by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' butcher knife after the war, but the targets the U.S.-Japan reactionaries want to kill are by no means limited to Mr. Asanuma alone. The murderer who killed Mr. Asanuma has confessed that, under the instructions of fascist leaders condoned by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, he had also prepared to assassinate Mr. Sanzo Nosaka, chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, and Mr. Takeshi Kobayashi, chairman of the Japan Teachers Union. This confession further exposed how frantically the U.S.-Japan reactionaries are plotting a bloody massacre of the Japanese people. This not only exposes the ferocity and cruelty of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries but also profoundly educates the Japanese people, making them more clearly aware that the contradiction between the Japanese people and U.S. imperialism and its agents will not stop until the day it is resolved, and the struggle between the two roads will not stop until the day it is resolved. The U.S.-Japan reactionaries' dagger that assassinated Mr. Asanuma is aimed not only at the Japan Socialist Party and the Japanese patriotic and democratic forces but also at all the Japanese people.
    Mr. Asanuma's blood will never be shed in vain. This despicable act of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries can only ignite the anger in the hearts of millions of Japanese people and awaken more masses. In recent days, people in various parts of Japan have held protests and demonstrations, and four million workers in Japan staged a massive strike in eight hundred locations on the 15th to protest the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' murder of Inejiro Asanuma, demanding the abolition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and demanding the Ikeda cabinet to immediately resign en masse. The Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries has re-emerged with a new upsurge shortly after Nobusuke Kishi stepped down. The great Japanese people, who have a tradition of national independence, national self-esteem, and a desire for peace, will surely crush all terrorist conspiracies and continue to hold high the banner of striving for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality and advance victoriously. As Premier Zhou Enlai of our country pointed out: "The Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and the promotion of the normalization of relations between China and Japan will surely achieve final victory; Mr. Asanuma's unfinished cause will surely be realized with the victory of the Japanese people's struggle." The Chinese people guarantee that they will always stand with the Japanese people, fight to the end against the aggressive policies and war policies of the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and defend peace in Asia and the world.

    浅沼先生的鲜血决不会白流
    日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎，本月12日在东京发表竞选演说时，不幸为法西斯暴徒杀害。浅沼先生的被害，是日本爱国民主力量的重大损失。日本社会党决定在今天为浅沼先生举行葬仪。日本一百四十多个政党和团体组成的“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”为了抗议美日反动派杀害浅沼先生，也决定提前在今天举行第二十三次反对日美军事同盟条约的全国统一行动。在这次全国统一行动中，日本人民除了继续反对日美“安全条约”、要求废除日美军事同盟而外，并且坚决要求对杀害浅沼稻次郎事件负责的池田政府实行总辞职。中国人民对浅沼先生遇刺逝世表示深切的哀悼，对浅沼先生的家属致以诚挚的慰问，对美日反动派谋杀浅沼先生的血腥暴行，表示极大的愤慨。中国人民坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟、要求严惩杀害浅沼先生的真正凶手的正义斗争。
    浅沼先生是日本卓越的爱国政治家。在日本人民反对美帝国主义侵略、争取独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争中，浅沼先生是一位积极的战士，并且一直站在反对日美军事同盟条约运动的前列。他曾经不断指出，日美“安全条约”是侵略性军事同盟，日本人民必须为废除这一条约而斗争。浅沼先生直到被杀害的几分钟前，还在强烈地谴责日美军事同盟条约，要求日本成为完全独立的国家。他慷慨激昂地向听众说：“美日安全条约问题是日本最重要的问题。由于政府强行修改安全条约，十五年来备尝驻扎外国军队之苦的日本，将不得不容许美军再使用它的领土十年。这是日本历史上未曾有过的不平常情况。”他强调“为了成为完全独立的国家，日本应当要求美军撤退，要求把美国占领的全部地区归还日本。为了摆脱美国的占领，日本应当成为中立的国家。”浅沼先生临终前的声音反映了广大日本人民保卫民族独立、维护民族尊严的坚强意志。
    浅沼先生也是中国人民尊敬的朋友。他一贯反对日本反动政府追随美国、敌视中国、制造“两个中国”和阻挠中日两国关系正常化的政策，为促进中日两国人民友好和争取建立两国邦交进行了不懈的努力。1957年和1959年，浅沼先生曾经两次率领社会党代表团访问我国，给中国人民留下了深刻的印象，对于加强中日两国人民在共同斗争中的友好合作做出了重大的贡献。直到浅沼先生被刺身死以前，他仍然大声疾呼地主张“中国只有一个，台湾是中国的一部分。日本必须尽早使中日邦交正常化。”浅沼先生的这些讲话，代表着日本人民要求同中国友好的强烈愿望，使中国人民对于这位忠实的朋友永远保持怀念和尊敬的心情。
    浅沼先生不仅致力于中日友好事业，而且对保卫远东和世界和平，发展亚非各国人民团结的事业，作出了积极的贡献。浅沼先生主张以缔结日、中、苏、美互不侵犯条约为基础建立远东集体安全体系来代替日本同美国的军事联盟，并且全面支持我国周恩来总理关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国签订互不侵犯的和平公约，把这一地区建成为无核子武器地区的建议。浅沼先生曾不顾美帝国主义的恐吓和威胁，一再指出：“美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人”，“美帝国主义是亚洲人民的共同敌人”。他还认为，维护远东和平的基本问题，首先就是要美国从它在冲绳和日本其他部分、中国的台湾、南朝鲜和菲律宾的基地撤退它的军队。尽管美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二曾经极端蛮横地要求浅沼先生收回他对美帝国主义的指责，但是，浅沼先生拒绝了这种无理要求，坚持了严正的立场。
    浅沼先生是正当他高声呼喊争取日本的独立、民主、和平、中立的时刻，被刺杀在他用以揭露和打击美日反动派的讲坛上的。这一切，决非出于偶然。这是美日反动派向日本人民发动新进攻的一个严重讯号，是美日反动派在日本大选前夕企图打击社会党、共产党和日本其他爱国民主力量的整个阴谋的一部分。
    最近一年半来，日本人民在社会党、共产党和日本其他爱国民主力量的共同领导下，接连发动了二十二次反对日美军事同盟条约的全国统一行动，沉重打击了美日反动派的战争计划和复活日本军国主义的步骤。因此，美日反动派千方百计地向日本爱国民主力量和日本人民发动进攻，企图破坏日本人民的反美爱国运动。继罪恶昭彰的岸信介上台的池田政府，早在9月间就已经开始叫嚷要在10月中旬“审判”参加反美爱国斗争的人；9月底，东京警察当局公然起诉日本“阻止修改日美安全条约国民会议”事务局长和社会党国会议员田中稔男等三位干部，企图打击日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的爱国正义斗争。池田政府的警察厅，本月11日更召开全国警察头目会议，布置各地警察在大选前夕加紧镇压民主力量。池田政府的警察厅长官柏村公开叫嚣要在竞选中对民主力量进行“有效的取缔”。
    与此同时，美日反动派为了实施日美军事同盟条约，正全力加紧推行复活日本军国主义的政策，使日本成为美帝国主义侵略亚洲的帮凶。池田政府成立以来，不过短短三个月的时间，就决定将日本明年度的直接军费增加到二千亿日元以上，并且阴谋在日本大选结束后同美军共同建立联合作战总部，加强日本军队的核战争准备，加紧策划修改日本宪法和“警察官职务执行法”，积极准备增加警察人数和使警察的装备现代化。为了同样的目的，池田政府还在漂亮言辞的掩盖下，开始实行高物价、低工资等一系列向日本劳动人民的生活权利发动进攻的反动措施，把庞大的军费负担转嫁到日本人民身上，这就不能不使得美日反动派和日本人民的矛盾进一步尖锐化起来。
    战后以来，在日本人民同美日反动派之间，一直存在着两条道路的斗争：日本是独立还是从属于美国，是和平还是战争，是民主还是军事独裁，是中立还是成为美国侵略集团的一员和美国发动新战争的帮凶。这两条道路，是广大日本人民同美帝国主义及其代理人之间不可调和的斗争，是决定日本命运的一场斗争。浅沼先生进行爱国正义斗争，虽然丝毫没有超出日本现行宪法规定的范围，但是，由于反映了日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的愿望，他就成为美日反动派的眼中钉，所以在浅沼先生被刺之后，美国合众国际社立即公开叫嚷“浅沼早就是日本政府的心腹之患”。这真是美国反动派最明显不过的自我暴露。浅沼先生是战后在美日反动派的屠刀下第一个受难的日本爱国政治家，但是，美日反动派所要杀害的对象绝不止于浅沼先生一人。杀害浅沼先生的凶手已经供认，他在美日反动派纵容的法西斯头目指使下，还曾经准备谋杀日本共产党主席野坂参三和日本教职员工会委员长小林武等人。这一供状，进一步暴露了美日反动派是何等疯狂地策划着对日本人民的血腥屠杀。这不仅暴露了美日反动派的凶暴残忍，并且深刻地教育了日本人民，使他们更清楚地认识到，日本人民同美帝国主义及其代理人之间的矛盾一天不解决，两条道路的斗争就一天不可能停止。美日反动派刺杀浅沼先生的匕首，不只是对着日本社会党和日本爱国民主力量，而且是对着全体日本人民的。
    浅沼先生的鲜血决不会白流。美日反动派的这种卑鄙行径只能燃起千百万日本公众心头的怒火，唤起更多群众的觉醒。连日以来，日本各地人民纷纷举行的抗议示威，日本四百万工人15日在八百个地方举行声势浩大的大罢工，抗议美日反动派杀害浅沼稻次郎，要求废除新日美“安全条约”，要求池田内阁立即引咎总辞职。日本人民反对美日反动派的斗争，在岸信介下台以后不久，重又出现了新的高涨。具有民族独立传统、民族自尊心和和平意愿的伟大的日本人民，必将粉碎一切恐怖阴谋，继续高举争取独立、民主、和平、中立的旗帜胜利前进。正如我国周恩来总理所指出的：“日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立和促进中日两国关系正常化的斗争，一定能够取得最后的胜利；浅沼先生未竟的事业，一定能够随着日本人民斗争的胜利而得到实现。”中国人民保证，一定永远同日本人民站在一起，为反对共同的敌人美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫亚洲和世界的和平而奋斗到底。
