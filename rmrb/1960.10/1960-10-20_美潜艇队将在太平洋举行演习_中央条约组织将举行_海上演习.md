Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 17th: The United States Navy has announced that the US will conduct large-scale submarine warfare exercises in the waters off Hawaii starting on October 31.

It is announced that the scale of this exercise is "unprecedented" and the exercise is to test the capabilities of the US Pacific Submarine Fleet.

In addition to the Pacific Submarine Fleet, several Air Force squadrons and twenty-one ships will participate in the exercise.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 18th: According to a communiqué issued by the Pakistan Naval Headquarters here last night, the CENTO (Central Treaty Organization) aggressive bloc is scheduled to hold a large-scale "maritime exercise" in the Arabian Sea off Karachi from October 25 to November 9.

The communiqué said that the forces participating in this "exercise" will be much larger in scale than the "exercises" held by this military aggressive bloc in 1958 and 1959.

The United States, Britain, Iran, and Pakistan, the participating countries, will provide troops, as well as aircraft carriers, supply ships, and maritime aircraft.

This "exercise" is yet another in a series of "exercises" conducted by this military aggressive bloc this year to expand its military strength, prepare for war, and create tensions. This bloc held air force "exercises" simultaneously in Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan from May 14 to 16 this year. In this air force "exercise", the US Air Force played a leading role.

    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：美国海军方面宣布，美国将从10月31日起在夏威夷海面举行大规模的潜艇战演习。
    据宣布，这次演习的规模“空前巨大”，演习是为了试验美国太平洋潜艇队的能力。
    除了太平洋潜艇队以外，还有几个空军中队和二十一艘舰只将参加这次演习。
    新华社卡拉奇18日电　据巴基斯坦海军总部昨晚在这里发出的公报说，中央条约侵略集团定于10月25日到11月9日在卡拉奇的阿拉伯海上举行大规模的“海上演习”。
    公报说，参加这次“演习”的部队在规模上将比这个军事侵略集团在1958年和1959年举行的“演习”大得多。
    这次“演习”将由参加国美国、英国、伊朗和巴基斯坦提供部队以及航空母舰、供应船只和海上飞机等。
    这次“演习”是这个军事侵略集团为扩军备战、制造紧张局势在今年举行的一系列“演习”中的又一次“演习”。这个集团在今年5月14日到16日曾在土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦同时举行空军“演习”。在这次空军“演习”中，美国空军起了主导的作用。
