Zhang Xiruo said that the Chinese people deeply admire the heroic struggle of the Albanian people, under the leadership of the glorious Albanian Labor Party, to build socialism and defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and are proud to have brothers and comrades like the Albanian people. He said that the Chinese people cherish the friendship with the Albanian people very much and regard the continuous development of this friendship as their sacred duty.

Chairman M. Treska said in his speech that the implementation plan of the cultural cooperation agreement between our two countries is an example of our concrete implementation of Marxist-Leninist principles in life. This plan, and the consistent help that China has given us, are concrete manifestations of the Chinese people and the Chinese Party in implementing Marxist-Leninist principles.

Chairman M. Treska said that the reason why we have traveled thousands of miles to China this time and received a warm reception is determined by the power of Marxism-Leninism and the strength of our two parties. He said that on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, Albania has established eternal friendship and cultural cooperation with the Chinese people; and it is also on this basis that the people of our two countries unite to fight for the purity of Marxism-Leninism and against modern revisionism, especially Yugoslav modern revisionism.
