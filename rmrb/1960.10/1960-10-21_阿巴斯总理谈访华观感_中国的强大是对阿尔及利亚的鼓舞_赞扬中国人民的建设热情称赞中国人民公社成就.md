Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, Abbas Ferhat, received Yu Liguang, head of the Chinese Exhibition Delegation to the Tunis International Fair, and Yue Daiheng, the deputy head, at his residence on the afternoon of the 18th. During the meeting, Abbas spoke about his impressions of his visit to China.

He said that this visit enabled him to understand China and the Chinese people. He expressed his gratitude to the Chinese leaders and the Chinese people for their warm welcome and reception to him and his delegation. He happily recalled the cordial talks with Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other Chinese leaders.

Prime Minister Abbas praised the enthusiasm of the Chinese people in the construction of their motherland. He said that all the work of the Chinese government is for the people, and the construction and facilities of the Beijing Railway Station are an example. He said that he had not seen such a station in any capitalist country. He also praised the achievements of the Chinese People's Communes.

Abbas Ferhat said that when he reviewed the Chinese militia, he believed that a country where even women take up guns is unconquerable.

Abbas said that China's strength is an encouragement to the Algerian people. He said that, as the Chinese leaders said, China's 650 million people steadfastly stand on the side of the Algerian people. Abbas pointed out, "When we seek a peaceful solution to the Algerian question, we will never give up armed struggle until we achieve final victory."

Prime Minister Abbas expressed his hope that after Algeria gains independence, the Chinese people will help it with construction. He said that in Algeria, there was no national economy before, and all aspects of the domestic economy were controlled by French imperialists. France made Algeria only a commodity market for it.

Yu Liguang, head of the Chinese Exhibition Delegation, congratulated Prime Minister Abbas on the success of his visit to China, and expressed his respect to him and the Algerian people for their struggle against imperialism. He reiterated that the Chinese people will support the Algerian people's struggle against imperialism.

    阿巴斯总理谈访华观感
    中国的强大是对阿尔及利亚的鼓舞
    赞扬中国人民的建设热情称赞中国人民公社成就
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯·费尔哈特18日下午在他的寓所接见突尼斯国际博览会的中国展览团团长于黎光、副团长岳岱衡，接见时阿巴斯谈到他访问中国的观感。
    他说，这次访问使他对中国和中国人民有了了解。他对中国领导人和中国人民对他和他的代表团的热烈欢迎和接待表示感谢。他愉快地回顾了同毛泽东主席、刘少奇主席、周恩来总理和其他中国领导人的亲切会谈。
    阿巴斯总理赞扬中国人民在祖国的各项建设工作中的热情。他说，中国政府的一切工作都是为了人民，北京车站的兴建和设施就是一个例子。他说，在任何资本主义国家中，他都没有见到过这样的车站。他还称赞中国人民公社的成就。
    阿巴斯·费尔哈特说，当他检阅中国民兵的时候，他相信，连妇女也拿起枪杆来的一个国家是不可征服的。
    阿巴斯说，中国的强大是对阿尔及利亚人民的鼓舞。他说，正如中国的领导人所说的那样，中国的六亿五千万人民坚持不渝地站在阿尔及利亚人民这一边。阿巴斯指出，“当我们谋求和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的时候，我们决不放弃武装斗争，直到取得最后胜利。”
    阿巴斯总理表示希望在阿尔及利亚获得独立以后，中国人民将帮助它进行建设。他说，在阿尔及利亚，以前没有民族经济，国内的经济的各个方面都受到法国帝国主义者的控制。法国使阿尔及利亚成为只是它的一个商品市场。
    中国展览团团长于黎光祝贺阿巴斯总理访华成功，并对他和阿尔及利亚人民为反对帝国主义而进行的斗争表示敬意。并再次表示，中国人民将支持阿尔及利亚人民反对帝国主义的斗争。
