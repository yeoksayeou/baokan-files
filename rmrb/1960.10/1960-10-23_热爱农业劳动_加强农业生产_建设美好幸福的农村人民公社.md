    (I)
    Under the guidance of the Party's ideology of taking agriculture as the foundation, a mass movement to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production has set off a new upsurge. More than 500 million farmers, particularly the young and middle-aged, closely united in more than 20,000 rural people's communes, are more spirited and determined to engage in the great struggle to conquer nature; tens of thousands of government workers, workers, graduates, and demobilized soldiers are going to the countryside, the factories and mines, the schools, the offices, and the troops, batch after batch, and going to the forefront of agricultural production. The strength of the agricultural front has been greatly strengthened, and the scale of support for agriculture has been unprecedentedly expanded.
    In the struggle to transform the social landscape and the natural landscape, Chinese youth have always been the strongest shock force. Under the leadership and teaching of the Party, millions of outstanding young people dare to fight, love labor, do not shy away from hardships, do not care about rewards, and walk in the forefront of the cause of revolution and construction. The vast number of rural youth all regard engaging in agricultural labor, developing agricultural production, and building rural people's communes as glorious and heroic undertakings, and consciously and actively dedicate their strength, wisdom, and youth to this cause. Many urban youth and school youth also regard going to the countryside as entering a furnace for tempering revolutionary will and a school for learning production knowledge, and regard rural people's communes as a vast world in which they can make great achievements, and want to fight on the agricultural front for life to build socialism and realize communism. They deeply understand the great significance of the Party's policy of developing agriculture, and have been implementing the Party's policy with practical and hard work for many years. Their thoughts and actions have been praised by the broad masses. Everyone praises the "Swallow Assault Team" and "Iron Girls Assault Team" in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, and their captains Xing Yanzi and Zhang Xiumin, who have worked hard to change the face of poor teams; praises the youth experimental field of Jinxi County, Jiangxi Province, which has transformed batches of low-yield fields into high-yield fields in the Liuli People's Commune, and their director Song Ximing; praises the seven good girls of the "Assault Team for Greatly Fighting Low-Yield Fields" in Ge Village Farm, Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province; praises the twenty-three good young men of the Youth Experimental Field in Yongle Commune, Zhaozhou County, Heilongjiang Province, who transformed saline-alkali land and the poor face of their hometown; praises the Youth Assault Team of Guzhou Commune, Rongjiang County, Guizhou Province, who transformed barren mountains and thin soil into economic forests and high-yield fields, and their captains Qin Bichao and Liu Yujin; praises the "Flying Tiger Assault Team" of the Genghis Khan People's Commune in Butha Banner, Inner Mongolia, who fought against insect pests and floods, and strived to win high yields, and their captain Huang Xuejun; praises the Communist Youth League Chemical Factory of the Duanjia People's Commune in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, which started with three iron pots and is now able to manufacture more than 100 kinds of chemical fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, pesticides, etc., and their factory director He Wenyi; praises the outstanding young commune members and young cadres in every province, city, and autonomous region, every county and banner, and every people's commune who have made contributions to vigorously developing agriculture, and praises the outstanding young workers, young cadres, and young students who have gone from large, medium, and small cities, large, medium, and small enterprises, and large, medium, and small schools to the countryside to dedicate their strength to vigorously developing agriculture. These young people have improved their political consciousness, strengthened their labor views, and enriched their production knowledge in rural life and production labor, and have also played an active role in promoting agricultural production, developing rural culture, and accelerating the construction of rural people's communes. For example, more than 11,400 high school, junior high school, and senior primary school graduates in Yanji County, Jilin Province, who have participated in agricultural labor in recent years, have made remarkable achievements and have been loved by the masses. In the past year or so, more than 300 people have joined the Party, more than 500 people have joined the League, more than 700 people have been elected as deputy captains of the people's commune production team (accounting for 40% of the total number of captains in the county), 300 people are working as feeders (also accounting for 40% of the total number of feeders in the county), and more than 8,000 people have participated in agricultural scientific research, and many people have become new types of agricultural scientific workers. The vast number of commune members are satisfied to call them "all-round talents of the rising stars."
    Under the education of the Party and the influence of advanced young people, a new generation of agricultural laborers with socialist consciousness and culture is booming and growing, and the ranks of youth shock workers fighting to build a more beautiful and happy rural people's commune are rapidly expanding. Especially after the Party further issued the call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, the ideology and actions of "taking agriculture as an honor and taking agriculture as a pleasure" are emerging everywhere. Taking only the suburbs of Tangshan City and the counties under its jurisdiction in Hebei Province as an example, after the movement to learn from Xing Yanzi was launched, more than 10,000 advanced shock teams of the "Yanzi Team" type appeared in a short period of time. In Henan Province, more than 1.6 million young people have recently gone to the forefront of agricultural production from all walks of life, making the youth at the forefront of agriculture in the province rise from about 40% of the total number of young people in the province to about 70%. These new phenomena further prove that the Party's ideology and the Party's policies, when grasped by the broad masses, will become a huge material force.
    (II)
    The Party's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation is a long-term and fundamental strategic policy. It has not only major economic significance, but also far-reaching political significance. It not only plays a major role in accelerating the construction of socialism, but will also play a major role in realizing communism in the future. Developing agriculture is an extremely important cause and an extremely glorious cause. Agricultural production is the first major thing that is most closely related to the eating, clothing, and daily life of the 650 million people in the country. With the further great development of agricultural production, with more grain, non-staple food, and industrial raw materials, it can open up the broadest market for heavy industrial products, absorb more light industrial products, and provide more labor and funds for industry; the things produced by each rural people's commune can supply the needs of more people, and the great development of the entire national economy will have a more solid foundation. By constantly strengthening this foundation and giving full play to the leading role of industry, especially heavy industry, we can build socialism faster and better, and our country can develop at a high speed into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern culture and science, and realize the great ideal of communism at an early date.
    One of the main conditions for realizing communism is to eliminate the three differences between industry and agriculture, cities and countryside, and manual labor and mental labor. In eliminating the three differences, strengthening agricultural production is a decisive key. In the eleven years since liberation, while carrying out socialist revolution, the Party has adopted the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, industry as the leading factor, and combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture. Especially in recent years, it has realized the Great Leap Forward and continued leap forward, developed and consolidated rural people's communes, and the face of our cities and countryside has undergone earth-shaking changes. The state of antagonism between industry and agriculture, cities and countryside, and manual labor and mental labor has disappeared, and the differences between them have begun to narrow. During the First Five-Year Plan, the growth rate of total industrial output value and total agricultural output value was four to one; in 1959, it had changed to 2.35 to one. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in agricultural production has been widely carried out, the improvement of agricultural tools has been widely promoted, and agricultural machinery has gradually increased. The newly added agricultural machinery power this year alone is equivalent to the power of nearly 20 million laborers. While developing agricultural production, the industry and scientific and cultural education undertakings of the vast rural people's communes have developed rapidly, and the material life and cultural level of the peasants have also been improved accordingly. However, our country has only emerged from the old China, which was a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, for eleven years. Generally speaking, the material and cultural living standards are still low, and compared with cities, the countryside is poorer and whiter, rural life is more difficult, and agricultural labor is more onerous. The Party and the state are mobilizing the broad masses of the people to strengthen the agricultural front precisely in order to vigorously change this situation. After less than ten years, our countryside will undergo more significant changes. By that time, the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967 will be realized, the agricultural mechanization plan of "solving the problem in a small way in four years, solving the problem in the middle in seven years, and solving the problem in a big way in ten years" will be realized, agriculture can be basically mechanized, more than half of the cultivated land can be irrigated and gardenized, and electrified to a certain extent; the output of grain may increase substantially; the industry and transportation industries run by the communes can develop faster; forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries can also be greatly developed, and all of them will achieve a certain degree of semi-mechanization and mechanization; ordinary floods, droughts, and the most serious insect pests, diseases, and animal pests that endanger crops can be basically eliminated; the most serious diseases that endanger the people and the "four pests" can be basically eliminated; the living conditions of commune members can be improved in stages and in batches; the commune's education, culture, and scientific research undertakings can be further popularized. In short, the collective production and collective life of rural people's communes will reach a higher level. After the realization of the National Agricultural Development Program, it will move further forward on the road of gradually eliminating the three differences. By that time, if we continue to struggle and create richer and more solid material and spiritual conditions, and after multi-faceted efforts and long-term struggle, the three differences can be eliminated, and people can live a richer and more beautiful material and spiritual life under the communist banner of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."
    Such a magnificent and beautiful picture will become a reality in front of the contemporary youth. How can this generation of youth not be excited and encouraged by this infinitely broad and infinitely beautiful future! Such a great ideal will be transformed into reality by the contemporary youth themselves. How can this generation of youth not be excited and proud of shouldering such an important and glorious historical task! At the same time, we must also see that the complete realization of the National Agricultural Development Program is not an easy task; it will require a long-term and arduous struggle to finally eliminate the three differences in the future. Only by loving agricultural labor more, strengthening agricultural production more, and working harder to build rural people's communes can we have richer agricultural products; with richer agricultural products, industry can develop more rapidly, and it can also carry out technical transformation of agriculture more rapidly, and accelerate the elimination of the differences between agriculture and industry. Only when agricultural productivity is greatly improved can the living conditions in the countryside be greatly improved. At the same time, since the current agricultural labor conditions are more difficult and the class struggle in the countryside is more complicated, intellectuals participating in agricultural labor can be trained faster and better. Since agricultural labor is the largest amount of physical labor in our country, and the difference between agricultural physical labor and mental labor is greater than the difference between industrial physical labor and mental labor, to gradually eliminate the difference between physical labor and mental labor, we need to invest more and more strength in agricultural labor. This is also more conducive to the elimination of the differences between workers and peasants and the differences between urban and rural areas. Therefore, for a considerable period of time, mobilizing more people to participate in agricultural labor, more people to strengthen the agricultural front, and more people to build rural people's communes can continuously improve agricultural labor conditions and rural living conditions faster and better, and get closer to industry and closer to cities, until they finally catch up with industry and catch up with cities.
    It is precisely because loving agricultural labor, strengthening agricultural production, and building rural people's communes are of such great significance that the Party has always placed the greatest expectations on youth in this regard. The National Agricultural Development Program "Forty Articles" specifically lists the following: "Educate rural youth to love the motherland, love the countryside, love labor, and love the commune as their home, and encourage them to actively learn culture and agricultural science and technology, and learn the production experience of elderly and middle-aged farmers. Rural youth should become the shock force in rural production construction and scientific and cultural undertakings. Young people who graduate from middle and primary schools in cities, in addition to being able to go to school and find employment in cities, should actively respond to the call of the state, go to the countryside and mountains to participate in agricultural production and participate in the great cause of socialist agricultural construction. Eighty-five percent of our country's population is in the countryside. If agriculture is not developed, industry cannot develop alone. It is very necessary and extremely glorious to go to work in the countryside." The youth in the countryside and cities should shoulder this extremely glorious cause, make every effort to strengthen this shock force, use the power of the collective, use their own hands, fight heroically, work diligently, further change the face of agriculture and the countryside, further improve their revolutionary will and ideological level, accelerate the speed of socialist construction, and create a bright future for communism.
    (III)
    The rural people's commune has a bright future and arduous tasks. We must work hard and diligently, and after a considerable period of arduous struggle, we can realize our great ideal.
    Our revolutionary predecessors, under the correct leadership of the Party, were not afraid of difficulties and hardships, and were not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice. They overthrew the three mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, so that we can live a life free from enslavement and exploitation today, and opened up the road to communism. We, the younger generation, should continue to work hard, learn from the example of our revolutionary predecessors, and under the leadership of the Party, not avoid dangers and not fear hardships, remove the two mountains of "poor" and "white," and open up the road to communism more broadly, so that we and our descendants can live in the happiest communist era, and can wage a struggle against nature on a more magnificent scale.
    Is it that we need to work hard in the democratic revolution period, but we no longer need to work hard in the socialist revolution and socialist construction period? We cannot imagine it this way. Now it is much happier than in the democratic revolution period; however, no matter what era, there are always more difficult places and more difficult jobs. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in 1957: "Many young people, due to lack of political experience and social life experience, are not good at comparing the old China with the new China, and it is not easy to deeply understand how the people of our country have gone through thousands of hardships to get rid of the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and what kind of long-term arduous labor it will take to build a beautiful socialist society." Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out that it is necessary to carry out practical and vivid political education on a regular basis, "to make all young people understand that our country is still a very poor country, and it is impossible to fundamentally change this state in a short period of time. It all depends on the youth and all the people uniting and fighting for decades to create a rich and strong country with their own hands. The establishment of the socialist system has opened up a path for us to reach the ideal state. The realization of the ideal state still depends on our hard work. Some young people think that everything should be good in a socialist society, and they can enjoy ready-made happy life without any effort. This is an unrealistic idea." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") We must keep Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions firmly in mind. We should recognize that sweeping away "poverty and blankness" and building socialism is by no means something that can be done by sitting quietly in the house or walking around like a walk. This requires us to concentrate all our energy and work hard and practically for many years. After removing the two mountains of "poverty and blankness," there is still a long way to go before we can fully realize the great ideal of communism. Although by that time, the various conditions will be much better than today, there will still be many hardships and difficulties that revolutionaries need to overcome and fight against. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "What is work? Work is struggle. There are difficulties and problems in those places that need us to solve. We work and fight to solve difficulties." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 4, p. 1160) Revolutionary work is overcoming difficulties. To constantly revolutionize, we must constantly fight against difficulties. Our current hardships are precisely for the happy tomorrow of communism. When the happy tomorrow comes, the most advanced people will still bravely go to the more difficult places and rush to take on the more difficult jobs, which is for a more happy future. In this way, we will continue to revolutionize, continue to struggle, and continue to move forward. Each generation will enjoy the results of the hard struggles of the previous generation, and each generation will continue to struggle hard for the next generation. Only in this way can people's happiness continue to grow and human society continue to move forward vigorously.
    How to treat hard work and how to treat physical labor is the watershed between revolution and non-revolution, true revolution and false revolution. Only the exploiting classes love ease and hate labor and despise physical labor; communists regard physical labor as the first need of life. Revolutionary youths with great ambitions not only do not despise physical labor, but also consciously and willingly undertake arduous and heavy physical labor. Some people think that people's physical labor will be eliminated in the future, and everyone will just sit on soft chairs and press buttons, as easy as a game. This is a vision for the very distant future. If, at present, this vision is used as an excuse to refuse to participate in arduous and heavy physical labor, it essentially reflects the bourgeois idea of despising physical labor. Sitting on a soft chair and pressing a button is still arduous and heavy in another sense. We can imagine that when a jet pilot sits in front of many instruments, many buttons, and many red and green lights, and must press the buttons exactly according to the instructions of the instruments and red and green lights, any slight error will bring huge losses. Can we regard this labor as easy? The modern production tools need to be manufactured, installed, and repaired. Is the process of manufacturing, installing, and repairing them easy? How much hard and diligent work is needed to learn to manufacture, install, repair, and use these modern production tools? Is this easy? Any creative labor is not easy. It requires painstaking efforts, hard work, and even the risk of bloodshed and sacrifice in many production labors. The struggle for production, like the class struggle, requires hard work, courage, and perseverance, and victory can be achieved only after thousands of disasters and difficulties. In the battle for steel, in the battle for grain, in the arduous labor in deep mountains and dense forests, in the depths of the earth, in high altitude, in the ocean, in the dangerous labor of high temperature, high pressure, low temperature, low pressure, and corrosiveness and radioactivity, in rescuing production accidents, and in the struggle to overcome drought, rainstorms, and floods, a high degree of tenacity and self-sacrifice is required. The heroes of the Makou Incident, Qiu Cai Kang of Shanghai, Xu Xuehui of Yunnan, Li Gaiyun of Henan, and many advanced collectives are all examples for us to learn from. At present, especially in the countryside, we have not yet realized mechanization and automation. For a considerable period of time and in a considerable area, we must still engage in relatively arduous and heavy labor under the existing equipment conditions, and inevitably carry out arduous and heavy physical labor in wind, rain, scorching sun, and severe cold. In the future, newer and more labor-saving machines will continue to be produced; however, when each new type of machine is first produced, it is impossible to replace all the existing machines at once, so relatively speaking, there is always more arduous labor. Even in a communist society, we want to implement unprecedented large-scale magnificent plans to move mountains and fill seas, transform deserts, and transform the climate. We still need to implement more magnificent plans to conquer the universe, and we still need to pay a lot of arduous and heavy physical labor, and even take great risks. We strive to achieve mechanization and automation in order to continuously reduce the arduousness of labor, but not to eliminate physical labor, nor is it possible to eliminate physical labor. All the social wealth of mankind is created through physical labor. A normal healthy person naturally needs to carry out a certain amount of physical labor. Physical labor, including relatively heavy physical labor, will not be eliminated for ten thousand years.
    In October 1945, when some comrades were about to go from Yan'an to work in the front, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The more difficult the place, the more you have to go. This is a good comrade. The work in those places is very arduous. Arduous work is like a burden. It is placed in front of us to see if we dare to take it on. The burden is light and heavy. Some people pick the easy ones and fear the heavy ones, pushing the heavy burdens to others and picking the light ones for themselves. This is not a good attitude. Some comrades are not like this. They give the convenience to others and pick the heavy burdens, endure hardships before others, and enjoy themselves after others. Such comrades are good comrades. We must all learn this communist spirit." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 4, p. 1160) Young people should fully develop the communist style of "giving convenience to others and leaving difficulties to themselves," and be brave to undertake the most difficult work. The more difficult it is, the more glorious it feels; the more difficult it is, the more high-spirited it is. We must be determined to build the poorest place into the richest place and transform the most backward place into the most advanced place. This kind of thorough revolutionary spirit is the heroic nature of our revolutionary youth. Recently, newspapers have reported many such deeds, such as the youth construction team in Tulong Mountain, Jianping County, Liaoning Province, which, after three years of hard struggle, finally transformed the barren and poor mountainous area into "Qingsong Ridge," so that more than 20,000 mu of fertile land at the foot of the mountain was not scoured and a large amount of grain was produced. The youth in Liugui Bay, Jingbian County, at the foot of the Great Wall in Shaanxi Province, transformed the desolate sandy wasteland into a sea of forests and fertile land, and developed animal husbandry, which greatly improved the lives of the masses. The Jizhuang Brigade of the Ge Village Farm in Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province, Zhai Sumei and other seven girls, let others take over the low-yield fields they had transformed, and then transferred to new low-yield fields to fight. They have been doing this for three years. They said: "To change the poor and blank face, we young people must have a spirit of rushing forward, specializing in finding difficulties to fight, and specializing in giving easy things to others." What an admirable noble style! This communist spirit is constantly being promoted in our country and has become a new moral standard recognized by people. The youth who are at the forefront of the times should have this style earlier and more fully. When they are good, they should help others to be good; when their commune is rich, they should help other communes to be rich; when their country's revolution is successful, they should help the people of other countries to also be successful in the revolution. Whether it is transforming society or transforming nature, there is no end. With this spirit and style, we can promote the society to move forward without stopping.
    Young people are in a period of growth. Experiencing more hardships and difficulties is only beneficial to the healthy growth of the body and mind, and to the growth of knowledge and ability in class struggle and production struggle. High-quality steel can only be refined in the fierce fire and high temperature, and cold-resistant pine and cypress cannot grow in the greenhouse. Only in difficult environments and in heroic struggles can we cultivate strong revolutionary ambition and perseverance, increase rich combat experience and outstanding talent, and make greater contributions to the revolution and the people. The bourgeoisie always corrupts people with love of ease and greed for enjoyment. For the sake of the interests of the revolution and the future of the youth, we must not ignore the corrupting effect of the bourgeois ideology of fearing hardships and seeking pleasure. Young people should be vigilant, resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology, and go to the mass movement to train themselves, constantly improve their socialist and communist consciousness, make themselves withstand the wind and waves and hardships and difficulties, and make themselves become strong fighters for socialism and communism.
    (IV)
    Taking agriculture as the foundation is a long-term strategic policy for the construction of our country; developing agricultural production is the cause of our people for thousands of generations. Today, the forefront of socialist construction is in the countryside. Rural youth, and youth who have transferred to the countryside from the industrial, commercial, cultural, and other fronts, must take the advanced figures on the agricultural front as their example, carry forward the revolutionary tradition, dare to undertake the most arduous and difficult tasks, set great goals, establish lofty ambitions, vow to make a revolution against the fate of "poverty and blankness," and build a beautiful and happy rural people's commune. Young workers, young commercial workers, young cultural workers, and young students who are still staying in their original positions should also learn from the advanced youth who are diligent, simple, and contribute all their strength to developing agricultural production in the most "poor" and "blank" places, and at the same time establish the ideology of loving agriculture, loving farmers, loving the countryside, and loving physical labor, so that their business and knowledge can better serve agricultural construction.
    In the mass movement of developing agriculture and grain production, the Communist Youth League organizations at all levels, all League cadres, and Communist Youth League members have particularly important responsibilities. Communist Youth League members must resolutely stand at the forefront of the movement, actively publicize the Party's policies, work heroically, and play a leading role. At any time, under any conditions, and in any task, we must fully develop the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and hard work, be an example for the youth, and go wherever the Party points. The League organizations must constantly carry out practical and vivid political work, further transform the Party's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation into the actual actions of the vast number of young people, make loving agricultural labor a common moral standard for contemporary Chinese youth, and mobilize a large number of young people to go to the forefront of agricultural production. We must promptly summarize and promote advanced experiences, insert red flags, establish pacesetters, and attract the vast number of young people to learn from the advanced youth who are diligent and contribute all their strength to building rural people's communes, and set off one after another upsurge of socialist competition in learning from, catching up with, comparing with, and helping each other in agricultural production and supporting agriculture. At the same time, we must also better lead the youth to learn culture, learn scientific knowledge, and learn production technology, comprehensively care about the lives of the youth, and pay attention to the combination of work and rest. League cadres at all levels must set an example, go deep into the front line of production, eat, live, work, and consult with the masses, work steadily and diligently, and use practical actions to influence and educate the youth, and further mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast number of youth in developing agriculture.
    In the vast urban and rural areas of our country, a new upsurge of the mass movement of developing agriculture and grain production with everyone participating has already risen. Such a movement will surely powerfully create a new situation for the continued leap forward of our national economy, and will surely powerfully promote the entire cause of socialist construction. Young people across the country, take action, resolutely respond to the call of the Party, hold high the three red flags of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and bravely advance to win a great victory on the agricultural front, to accelerate the construction of socialism, and to realize the great ideal of communism at an early date!

    热爱农业劳动　加强农业生产  建设美好幸福的农村人民公社
    （一）
    在党的以农业为基础的思想指导下，大办农业、大办粮食的群众运动掀起了新的高潮。紧密地团结在两万多个农村人民公社里的五亿多农民，特别是其中的青壮年，更加意气风发、斗志昂扬地投入征服自然的伟大斗争；成千成万的机关工作人员、工人、毕业学生、复员军人，一批一批地从城市、从厂矿、从学校、从办公室、从部队走向农村，走上农业生产第一线。农业战线的实力大大地加强了，支援农业的规模空前地扩大了。
    在变革社会面貌、变革自然面貌的斗争中，我国青年从来是一支最强大的突击力量。在党的领导和教导下，千百万优秀青年敢于斗争，热爱劳动，不避艰险，不计报酬，走在革命和建设事业的最前列。广大农村青年，都把从事农业劳动、发展农业生产、建设农村人民公社看作光荣的豪迈的事业，自觉地积极地为此献出自己的力量、智慧和青春。许多城市青年、学校青年，也把到农村去看作投入锻炼革命意志的熔炉和学习生产知识的学校，把农村人民公社看作可以大有作为的广阔的天地，要为建设社会主义、实现共产主义而在农业战线上终生战斗。他们深切了解党的发展农业的方针的重大意义，多年来一直用踏实苦干的行动执行着党的方针。他们的思想和行动，受到广大群众的赞扬。大家赞扬河北唐山市为改变穷队面貌而艰苦奋战的“燕子突击队”、“铁姑娘突击队”和她们的队长邢燕子、张秀敏；赞扬江西金溪县琉璃人民公社把一批又一批低产田改造成高产田的青年试验场和他们的场长宋喜明；赞扬江苏镇江市葛村农场“大战低产田的冲锋队”的七个好姑娘；赞扬黑龙江肇州县永乐公社改造盐碱地和家乡穷困面貌的青年试验场的二十三名好后生；赞扬贵州榕江县古州公社把荒山、瘦土改造成经济林、高产田的青年突击队和他们的队长秦必超、刘禹金；赞扬内蒙古布特哈旗成吉思汗人民公社与虫灾、洪水搏斗，奋力夺取高产的“飞虎突击队”和他们的队长黄学俊；赞扬陕西大荔县段家人民公社从三口铁锅起家到能够制造一百多种化肥、菌肥、农药等等的共青团化工厂和他们的厂长何文义；赞扬在每个省、市和自治区、每个县和旗、每个人民公社都有的为大办农业立下功劳的优秀的青年社员、青年干部，赞扬从大中小城市、大中小企业、大中小学校到农村去为大办农业献出力量的优秀的青年职工、青年干部和青年学生。这些青年，在农村生活和生产劳动中，提高了政治觉悟，增强了劳动观点，丰富了生产知识，同时也在推进农业生产、发展农村文化、加速农村人民公社的建设中起了积极作用。如吉林省延吉县几年来参加农业劳动的一万一千四百多名高中、初中、高小毕业的知识青年，绝大多数都做出了显著的成绩，受到了群众的喜爱。一年多来已经有三百多人入党、五百多人入团、七百多人当选为人民公社生产队正副队长（占全县队长总数的40％），三百人做着饲养员（也占全县饲养员的40％），八千多人参加了农业科学研究，许多人成为新型的农业科学工作者。广大社员满意地把他们称为“文武双全的后起之秀”。
    在党的教育和先进青年的影响下，有社会主义觉悟、有文化的新一代农业劳动者正在蓬勃成长，为建设更加美好幸福的农村人民公社而斗争的青年突击手的队伍正在迅速壮大。特别是在党进一步发出大办农业、大办粮食的号召之后，“以农为荣，以农为乐”的思想和行动处处风起云涌。只以河北唐山市郊区和市辖各县来说，在开展学习邢燕子运动以后不久，就出现了“燕子队”式的先进突击队一万多个。河南省最近期间从各行各业走向农业生产第一线的青年有一百六十多万人，使全省农业第一线的青年由原来占全省青年的40％左右上升到70％左右。这些新气象进一步证明，党的思想、党的方针掌握了广大群众，就会成为巨大的物质力量。
    （二）
    党提出的以农业为基础的方针，是一个长期的根本的战略方针。它不但有重大的经济意义，而且有深远的政治意义。它不但在加速建设社会主义中有重大作用，在将来实现共产主义中也将起重大作用。发展农业是极其重要的事业，也是极其光荣的事业。农业生产是同全国六亿五千万人口的吃饭、穿衣、日常生活有最密切关系的第一件大事情。农业生产进一步大发展了，有了更多的粮食、副食品和工业原料，能够为重工业产品开辟最广阔的市场，能够吸收更多的轻工业产品，能够为工业提供更多的劳动力和资金；每一个农村人民公社生产出来的东西能够供给更多人的需用，整个国民经济的大发展就有了更坚固的基础。不断地加强这个基础，充分地发挥工业、特别是重工业的主导作用，我们就可以更快更好地建设社会主义，我们的国家就能够高速度地发展成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代文化科学的富强的社会主义国家，提早实现共产主义的远大理想。
    实现共产主义的主要条件之一就是消灭工业和农业、城市和农村、体力劳动和脑力劳动这三个差别。在消灭三个差别中，加强农业生产是一个决定性的关键。解放后十一年来，党在进行社会主义革命的同时，采取了以农业为基础，以工业为主导，优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合的方针，特别是近几年来，实现了大跃进和持续跃进，发展和巩固了农村人民公社，我国城市和农村的面貌都发生了翻天复地的变化，工业和农业、城市和农村、体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的对立状态已经消失，它们之间的差别也已经开始缩小。第一个五年计划期间，工业总产值和农业总产值增长的速度是四比一；1959年，已经改变为二点三五比一。农业生产中的技术革新、技术革命运动广泛开展，改良农具普遍推广，农业机械逐渐增多。只是今年新增加的农业机械动力，就相当于将近两千万个劳动力的力量。在发展农业生产的同时，广大农村人民公社的工业和科学文化教育事业迅速发展，农民的物质生活和文化水平也相应地提高了。但是，我们的国家才从半封建半殖民地的旧中国脱胎出来十一个年头，就全国一般情况来说，物质文化生活水平还是低的，和城市比较起来，农村更穷更白，农村生活比较艰苦，农业劳动比较繁重。党和国家动员广大人民群众，加强农业战线，正是为了大力改变这种情况。再经过不到十年的时间，我们的农村就会发生更显著的变化。到了那个时候，实现了1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要，实现了“四年小解决、七年中解决、十年大解决”的农业机械化规划，农业就可以基本上实现机械化，半数以上的耕地实现水利化、园田化，并且在一定程度上实现电气化；粮食的产量就可能大幅度地增加；社办工业和交通运输业就可以更快地发展；林、牧、副、渔各业也都可以大大发展，并且都要实现一定程度的半机械化和机械化；普通的水灾、旱灾和危害农作物最严重的虫害、病害、兽害可以基本上消灭；危害人民最严重的疾病和“四害”可以基本上消灭；公社社员的居住条件可以分期分批地改善；公社的教育、文化和科学研究事业可以进一步普及。总之，农村人民公社的集体生产和集体生活，都将达到较高的水平。实现了全国农业发展纲要之后，就会在逐步消灭三个差别的道路上更前进一步。到那个时候，再继续奋斗下去，创造出来更丰富更坚实的物质条件和精神条件，经过多方面的努力和长时期的奋斗，三个差别就能够消灭，人们就能够在各尽所能、按需分配的共产主义旗帜下，过着越来越丰富、越来越美好的物质生活和精神生活。
    这样宏伟美丽的图景，就要在当代青年面前变成现实，这一代青年怎能不为这无限广阔、无限美好的前途欢欣鼓舞！这样的伟大理想，就要由当代青年亲手把它变成现实，这一代青年怎能不为担当着这样重大、光荣的历史任务而兴奋自豪！同时，我们又必须看到，全部实现全国农业发展纲要，并不是轻而易举的事情；要在将来最后消灭三个差别，更需要进行长期的艰苦奋斗。只有更加热爱农业劳动，更加加强农业生产，更加努力建设农村人民公社，才会有更丰富的农产品；有了更丰富的农产品，工业就可能更迅速发展，也就可能更加迅速地对农业进行技术改造，加速地消灭农业和工业的差别。只有农业生产力大大提高了，农村的生活条件才可能大大改善。同时，由于当前农业的劳动条件更艰苦些，农村的阶级斗争也比较复杂些，所以，知识分子参加农业劳动，能够更快更好地受到锻炼。由于农业劳动是我国最大量的体力劳动，而且农业体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的差别，比工业体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的差别更大，所以，要逐步消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别，就需要在农业劳动方面投入更大更多的力量。这也更有利于工农差别和城乡差别的消灭。因而，在相当长的时期内，动员更多的人来参加农业劳动，更多的人来加强农业战线，更多的人来建设农村人民公社，就可以更快更好地使农业劳动条件和农村生活条件不断改进，更接近工业，更接近城市，以至于最后赶上工业，赶上城市。
    正因为热爱农业劳动、加强农业生产、建设农村人民公社有这样重大的意义，所以党一向在这方面寄予青年以最大的期望。在全国农业发展纲要“四十条”中就专门列出了这样的一条：“教育农村青年热爱祖国、热爱农村、热爱劳动和爱社如家，鼓励他们积极地学习文化和农业科学技术，学习老年和壮年农民的生产经验。农村青年应当成为农村的生产建设和科学文化事业中的突击力量。城市的中、小学毕业的青年，除了能够在城市升学、就业的以外，应当积极响应国家的号召，下乡上山去参加农业生产，参加社会主义农业建设的伟大事业。我国人口百分之八十五在农村，农业如果不发展，工业不可能单独发展。到农村去工作是非常必要的和极其光荣的。”农村和城市的青年，应该把这个极其光荣的事业担起来，尽一切努力加强这个突击力量，用集体的威力，用自己的双手，英勇斗争，辛勤劳动，进一步改变农业和农村的面貌，进一步提高自己的革命意志和思想水平，加快社会主义建设的速度，开创共产主义的锦绣前程。
    （三）
    建设农村人民公社前程远大，任务艰巨。必须发愤图强、埋头苦干，经过相当长时期的艰苦奋斗，才能实现我们伟大的理想。
    我们的革命前辈，在党的正确领导下，不畏艰难困苦，不怕流血牺牲，把帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山推倒，使我们今天能过着不受奴役、不受剥削的生活，并且开辟了通往共产主义的道路。我们青年一代，应当继续努力，学习革命前辈的榜样，在党的领导下，不避艰险、不怕困苦，把“穷”和“白”这两座大山搬掉，把通往共产主义的道路开拓得更加广阔，使我们自己以及我们的后代能够生活在最幸福的共产主义时代，能够以更宏伟的规模向大自然展开斗争。
    是不是在民主革命时期要艰苦奋斗，到了社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期就不再需要艰苦奋斗了呢？不能这样设想。现在是比民主革命时期幸福得多了；可是，无论什么时代，总有比较艰苦的地方，总有比较艰苦的工作。毛泽东同志在1957年指出：“不少青年人由于缺少政治经验和社会生活经验，不善于把旧中国和新中国加以比较，不容易深切了解我国人民曾经怎样经历千辛万苦的斗争才摆脱了帝国主义和国民党反动派的压迫，而建立一个美好的社会主义社会要经过怎样的长时间的艰苦劳动。”因此，毛泽东同志又指出，需要经常进行切实的、生动的政治教育，“要使全体青年们懂得，我们的国家现在还是一个很穷的国家，并且不可能在短时间内根本改变这种状态，全靠青年和全体人民在几十年时间内，团结奋斗，用自己的双手创造出一个富强的国家。社会主义制度的建立给我们开辟了一条到达理想境界的道路。而理想境界的实现还要靠我们的辛勤劳动。有些青年人以为到了社会主义社会就应当什么都好了，就可以不费气力享受现成的幸福生活了，这是一种不实际的想法。”（《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》）我们必须紧紧记着毛泽东同志对我们的指示。应该认识，扫除“一穷二白”，建设社会主义，绝不是“斯斯文文，安安静静”地在屋子里坐着或者像散步一样地走着就可以做到的事情。这需要我们集中全副精力苦干实干好多年。在搬掉“一穷二白”这两座大山之后，距离全部实现共产主义的伟大理想也还有很长的路程。虽然到了那个时候，各种条件比今天更要好得多，可是，也仍然会有许多艰辛困苦需要革命者去克服、去斗争。毛泽东同志说过：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1160页）革命工作，就是克服困难。要不断革命，就要不断地同困难作斗争。我们今天的艰苦，正是为了共产主义的幸福的明天。到了幸福的明天，最先进的人们也还是要勇敢地到比较艰苦的地方去，争先恐后地去担当比较艰苦的工作，那又是为了更幸福的后天。如此不断革命，不断斗争，不断前进，每一代都享受到上一代艰苦斗争的结果，每一代都为下一代而继续艰苦斗争。只有这样，才能使人们的幸福不断增长，才能使人类社会永远蓬蓬勃勃地不断前进。
    怎样对待艰苦奋斗，怎样对待体力劳动，是革命和不革命、真革命和假革命的分水岭。只有剥削阶级才好逸恶劳，轻视体力劳动；共产主义者则把体力劳动看成生活的第一需要。有雄心壮志的革命青年，不但不轻视体力劳动，并且还自觉自愿地承担艰苦繁重的体力劳动。有人认为将来人们的体力劳动将要消灭，都会变成只是坐在软椅子上按按电钮，像游戏一样轻松。这是对很遥远的将来的一种设想，如果在目前，把这种设想当成拒绝参加艰苦繁重的体力劳动的口实，实质上是反映了资产阶级轻视体力劳动的思想。坐在软椅子上按电钮的劳动，在另一种意义上，仍然是艰苦繁重的。我们可以设想一下，当一个喷气式飞机的驾驶员坐在许多仪表、许多电钮、许多红绿灯前面，要一丝不差地照仪表和红绿灯的指示按电钮，任何一点差错都会带来巨大的损失，我们能把这种劳动看成是轻松的吗？现代化的生产工具，需要制造，需要安装，需要修理，它的制造、安装、修理的过程是轻松的吗？要学会这种制造、安装、修理和运用这些现代化生产工具，需要多么艰苦辛勤的劳动，难道这是轻松的吗？任何创造性的劳动都不是轻松的，都要煞费苦心，都要出力出汗，甚至在很多生产劳动中也要冒流血牺牲的危险。生产斗争和阶级斗争一样，需要艰苦奋斗、勇往直前、不畏艰险、不怕困难，经过千灾万难而后取得胜利。在夺钢大战中、在夺粮大战中，在深山密林、在地层深处、在高空、在海洋的艰苦劳动中，在高温、高压、低温、低压、在腐蚀性和辐射性等危险性的劳动中，在抢救生产事故中、在战胜干旱、暴风雨、洪水的搏斗中，都需要高度的顽强和自我牺牲的精神。马口事件中的众英雄、上海的丘财康、云南的徐学惠、河南的李改云和许许多多的先进集体，都是我们学习的榜样。目前，特别是在农村，我们还远没有实现机械化、自动化，在一个相当长的时期内，在一个相当大的地区里，我们还必须在现有的设备条件下从事比较艰苦繁重的劳动，而且不可避免地要在狂风、暴雨、烈日、严寒下进行艰苦繁重的体力劳动。将来，更新式更省力的机器会不断产生；但是，在每一种更新式的机器刚产生的时候，总不可能一下子把原有的机器全部换掉，因此，相对地说总是有比较繁重的劳动。就是到了共产主义社会，我们要实行空前规模的移山填海、改造沙漠、改造气候的宏伟计划，我们还要实行更宏伟的征服宇宙的计划，仍旧需要付出大量的艰苦繁重的体力劳动，甚至要冒很大的危险。我们力求实现机械化、自动化，是为了不断地减轻劳动的繁重程度，但是并不是为了消灭体力劳动，也不可能消灭体力劳动。人类的一切社会财富，都是经过体力劳动才创造出来的。一个正常的健康的人，天然地需要进行一定的体力劳动。体力劳动，包括比较繁重的体力劳动在内，是一万年也消灭不了的。
    1945年10月，在有些同志将要从延安到前方去工作的时候，毛泽东同志指出：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。那些地方的工作是很艰苦的。艰苦的工作就像担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。有的同志不是这样，享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。这种共产主义者的精神，我们都要学习。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1160页）青年人应当充分发扬“把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己”的共产主义风格，勇于承担那些最困难的工作。越是艰苦，就越感到光荣；越是困难，就越斗志昂扬。要立志把最穷的地方建设成最富的地方，把最落后的地方改造成最先进的地方。这样的彻底革命精神，才是我们革命青年的英雄本色。最近报纸上报道过许多这样的事迹，像辽宁省建平县秃龙山的青年建设队，经过了三年的艰苦奋斗，终于把荒凉贫瘠的山区改造成“青松岭”，使山下二万多亩良田不受冲刷，增产了大量粮食。陕西省长城脚下的靖边县柳桂湾的青年把杳无人烟的沙荒改造成了林海良田，发展了牧畜业，使群众生活得到了很大改善。江苏镇江市葛村农场纪庄大队，翟素梅等七个姑娘，把低产田改造好了就让给别人，再转到新的低产田去战斗。她们已经这样做了三年。她们说：“要改变又穷又白的面貌，我们年轻人就要有一股子冲劲，专门找困难打，专门把容易做的事让给别人。”这是多么令人敬佩的高尚风格！这种共产主义精神，在我国正不断地发扬光大，已经成为人们公认的新的道德标准。走在时代前列的青年，应该更早更充分地具备这样的风格。自己好了，还要帮助别人好起来；自己的公社富裕了，还要帮助别的公社富起来；自己的国家革命成功了，还要帮助别的国家的人民也革命成功。无论改造社会或改造自然都是无止境的。有了这种精神和风格，才能推动社会不停顿地前进。
    青年人正处在成长时期，多经受一些艰难困苦的磨炼，对于身体和思想的健康成长，对于阶级斗争和生产斗争的知识和能力的增长，都是只有好处没有坏处的。在烈火高温中才能炼出优质的钢铁，在温室里绝生长不成耐寒的松柏。只有在艰苦的环境中，在英勇的斗争中，才能培养起来坚强的革命志气和坚韧的毅力，才能增长起来丰富的斗争经验和出色的才干，才能为革命为人民作出更大的贡献。资产阶级总是以好逸恶劳和贪图享受来腐蚀人。为了革命的利益，为了青年的前途，我们决不能忽视资产阶级那种害怕艰苦、贪图享受的思想的腐蚀作用。青年们应当提高警惕，抵抗资产阶级思想的侵蚀，并且要到群众运动中去锻炼自己，不断提高自己的社会主义和共产主义觉悟，使自己经得起大风大浪和艰难困苦，使自己成为社会主义和共产主义的坚强战士。
    （四）
    以农业为基础，是我国建设的长期战略方针；发展农业生产，是我国人民千秋万代的事业。今天，社会主义建设的最前线，就在农村。农村青年，从工业、商业、文化等等战线上转到农村去的青年，都要以农业战线上的先进人物为榜样，发扬革命传统，勇于承担最艰苦最困难的任务，立大志、树雄心，誓革“一穷二白”的命，建设美好幸福的农村人民公社。仍旧留在原岗位上的青年工人、青年商业工作者、青年文化工作者、青年学生，也要向那些勤勤恳恳、艰苦朴素，在最“穷”最“白”的地方为发展农业生产而贡献一切力量的先进青年看齐，同时树立起热爱农业、热爱农民、热爱农村、热爱体力劳动的思想，使自己的业务和知识更好地为农业建设服务。
    在大办农业、大办粮食的全民运动中，共青团的各级组织，全体团的干部和共青团员，都负有特别重要的责任。共青团员要坚决站在运动的最前列，积极宣传党的政策，英勇劳动，发挥带头作用。在任何时候、任何条件下、任何任务中，都要充分发扬艰苦奋斗、埋头苦干的革命精神，做青年的榜样，党指向哪里就奔向哪里。团组织要不断进行切实的、生动的政治工作，把党的以农业为基础的方针更进一步变成广大青年的实际行动，使热爱农业劳动成为当代中国青年共同的道德标准，动员大批青年到农业生产第一线去。要及时总结和推广先进经验，大插红旗，大树标兵，吸引广大青年向那些勤勤恳恳为建设农村人民公社而贡献一切力量的先进青年看齐，在农业生产和支援农业方面掀起一个又一个的学、赶、比、帮的社会主义竞赛高潮。同时还要更好地领导青年学习文化、学习科学知识、学习生产技术，全面关心青年生活，注意劳逸结合。各级团的干部要以身作则，深入生产第一线，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，踏踏实实，埋头苦干，用实际行动影响和教育青年，进一步调动广大青年大办农业的积极性。
    在我国广大城乡，一个人人动手大办农业大办粮食的群众运动的新高潮已经起来了。这样一个运动，必将有力地开创我国国民经济继续跃进的新局面，必将有力地推进整个社会主义建设事业。全国青年们，行动起来，坚决响应党的号召，高举党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，为争取农业战线上的伟大胜利，为加速建设社会主义，为提早实现共产主义的远大理想，奋勇前进！
