Xinhua News Agency, 14th - Our country's winter wheat sowing work has fully begun. Currently, the sowing work in the main wheat-producing areas such as the Yellow River, Huai River plains, and North China has formed a high tide, and wheat sowing in the areas south of the Yangtze River has also begun one after another. In the northwest region, where the wheat sowing season is earlier, the sowing work is nearing completion. Since late September, many places in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, and other provinces have experienced rainfall. The people's communes in these areas are seizing the favorable opportunity after the rain to accelerate the sowing progress.

In the high tide of the whole party and all people engaging in agriculture and large-scale food production movement, the situation of this year's wheat sowing work is very good. The wheat sowing preparation work in various places is generally adequate. All localities have strengthened their leadership, concentrated more labor, and received strong support from industry, commerce, culture, and education. During the summer harvest this year, many areas' people's communes summarized the experience of increasing wheat production over the years. After the summer harvest, while strengthening the management of autumn-ripening crops, various places concentrated a certain amount of manpower and animal power to carry out fallow tillage and large-scale accumulation and production of fertilizer, rush to make and repair autumn sowing tools, select and test seeds, and train a group of sowing technicians. Once the autumn sowing season arrived at "White Dew," many wheat-producing areas' people's communes immediately put the concentrated superior labor force into the first line of wheat sowing while doing a good job in autumn harvesting. Leading cadres at all levels also went to the fields one after another, participating in sowing on the spot, commanding sowing, strengthening specific leadership of sowing work, and ensuring that various measures are quickly implemented. At present, each wheat region is carrying out large-scale inspections, appraisals, and competitions, promoting advanced experience, and grasping weak links to more comprehensively and better complete the wheat sowing task.

In the wheat sowing, all regions have further implemented the policy of both multiple planting and multiple harvesting and high yield and multiple harvesting. Hebei, Hunan, Xinjiang, Sichuan, and other provinces and regions are actively expanding the wheat sowing area. At the same time, all localities are trying every means to improve the sowing method, cultivate a large number of high-yield fields, and strive to lay a good foundation for high yield from the beginning of sowing. Some rice-producing areas in the south that previously planted less wheat have also expanded the wheat sowing area this year, striving for a double leap forward in wheat and rice. Many people's communes have made detailed plans for striving for high-yield and high-yield squares in the wheat sowing work, and have increased efforts in deep plowing, fertilization, and seed selection to strive for high yield. Hebei, Henan, Gansu, and other provinces are also focusing on low-yield fields in wheat sowing, striving for high yields in every field to achieve comprehensive and balanced production increase.

According to inspections in various places, the quality of wheat sowing this year is generally good. In the sowing, all localities have further implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture in accordance with local conditions. Most wheat fields have been finely cultivated and leveled before sowing, base fertilizer has also been increased, attention has been paid to moisture retention, the amount of seed sown is appropriate, and some seeds have been soaked and treated with pesticides.

Now that Cold Dew (October 8) has passed, the next solar term is Frost's Descent (October 23). This period is the busy season for wheat sowing in the main wheat-producing areas of our country. Therefore, all regions are racing against time and striving to complete the sowing task in a timely manner. At present, the main crop wheat in North China is about to be finished, and the rush to plant the replanted and late-planted wheat has begun. This year, due to the large area of autumn-ripening crops, there are more replanted and late-planted wheat than in previous years, so the arrangement of stubble must be quickly and properly resolved. In addition to using various methods to promote early maturity and early stubble of autumn-ripening crops, many people's communes also implement intercropping and interplanting of wheat on the premise of ensuring sowing quality, and sow replanted and late-planted wheat in advance to catch up with early-planted wheat.

Since late September, many places that were previously affected by drought have successively experienced rainfall, which has provided relatively good soil moisture conditions for wheat sowing, and various places have seized the favorable opportunity after the rain to accelerate the sowing progress. However, at present, some areas are still experiencing drought. The people's communes in these areas are continuing to sow with a tenacious fighting spirit. At the same time, all localities are generally paying attention to giving full play to the role of existing water conservancy projects, trying every means to increase water storage, and preparing more water sources for winter irrigation and spring irrigation.

Shandong

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 13th - Various places in Shandong Province are carrying out a blitz sowing of late-stubble wheat. According to statistics on October 10, the wheat sown in the province has accounted for 50% of the autumn planting plan. Yantai Prefecture, which has a faster progress, has completed more than 70% of the sowing plan.

In order to speed up the wheat sowing progress and sow the late-stubble wheat as early as possible, Party committees at all levels in Shandong continue to transfer a large number of cadres to go deep into the first line of production to help communes and teams specifically arrange labor and animal power. Under the specific help of Cui Zhenhua, Secretary of the Zibo Prefectural Committee of the CPC, the number of people participating in autumn planting in Zouping County increased from 110,000 to more than 130,000, and the animal power increased from 6,000 to 7,000, so that the daily sowing progress rapidly increased from more than 15,000 mu to 23,000 mu. The Party Committee of Pingyuan Commune in Licheng County deployed five secretaries and eight standing committee members to go deep into five brigades including Qiaotou and Gengjia to help each team arrange labor and animal power, so that the daily autumn sowing progress of the entire commune increased from 2,000 mu to more than 3,000 mu.

This year, there is less early-stubble and more late-stubble in autumn planting in Shandong Province, and it is also the season for harvesting late autumn. Harvesting and planting are squeezed together. In response to this situation, various places have unified arrangements for labor and animal power by summarizing experience, and adopted the method of close integration of harvesting and planting, as well as "assembly line operations" such as harvesting, transporting, plowing, and planting, to speed up the autumn planting speed. Shifuo Commune in Shouzhang County mobilized the masses to summarize the autumn planting experience, and implemented a series of three operations of plowing, harrowing, and sowing. The daily autumn planting progress increased from the original 700 mu to 1,200 mu. Fangzhai Commune in Guan County divided the labor force and animal power of the entire commune into five processes: harvesting, transporting, plowing, harrowing, and planting, and implemented assembly line operations. People did not travel empty-handed, and vehicles were not empty, which not only accelerated harvesting and transportation, but also increased the daily autumn planting progress from 700 mu to more than 1,500 mu.

Shaanxi

People's Daily, Xi'an, 13th - While expanding the autumn sowing area, people's communes in various places in Shaanxi Province are actively expanding the area of high-yield wheat fields.

Wheat sowing work in Shaanxi Province has entered the later stage. As of the 11th, more than 90% of the sowing has been completed in Yan'an and Yulin areas, 70% to 80% in counties and cities on the Weibei Plateau, and the sowing work in Guanzhong Plain and Southern Shaanxi, where the solar terms are later, has also been fully launched. The province sends out more than 2 million laborers every day to rush to sow wheat, and the daily progress has increased by two times compared with the first ten days of October and 60% compared with the same period last year.

This year, the area of high-yield wheat fields in Shaanxi Province is larger than in previous years, and the high-yield wheat fields established in the province account for about 40% of the total wheat field area. In the vigorous development of the high-yield wheat movement, various places are trying every means to improve the sowing quality of high-yield fields. HÃ¹ County has generally established model fields in each high-yield square. Zhang Shidi, the first secretary of the county party committee, personally went deep into the high-yield square of Chengguan Commune, and established a six-mu model field with cadres and technicians. This model field has a great influence on the surrounding 50,000 mu high-yield square. Every time a measure is implemented, many commune members in the surrounding areas come to visit and learn, and cultivate high-yield fields according to the standards of the model field, so that all the high-yield fields basically reach the standards of the model field. The high-yield wheat fields in Dali County account for 52% of the total wheat area, an expansion of 1.2 times compared with last year. The high-yield fields have all achieved one transformation (orchardization) and three sufficient (sufficient base fertilizer, sufficient fine seeds, sufficient row planters).

At present, there is widespread rainfall in Shaanxi. All localities are adjusting labor and animal power, seizing the opportunity, and rushing to sow wheat.

Anhui

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 13th - A vigorous autumn plowing and autumn sowing movement has been fully launched in Anhui Province. At present, nearly six million people in the province have invested in autumn plowing and autumn sowing and activities for sending fertilizer and accumulating fertilizer for autumn sowing; and more than 6.2 million mu of food crops such as wheat, barley, and peas, and 1.3 million mu of rapeseed have been sown.

This year, the province has mobilized more than 60,000 cadres to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, of which nearly 50% of the cadres went to poor teams and backward teams to help work. After these cadres went down, they greatly strengthened the weak links in agricultural production, so that autumn plowing and autumn sowing work were quickly launched and the sowing quality was improved. This year, there is relatively more base fertilizer applied for autumn sowing in various places in the province, and the fertilization method has also been greatly improved. In the areas north of the Huai River, in addition to applying base fertilizer, many areas also use soil fertilizer to mix seeds and sow with manure. In the areas south of the Huai River, methods such as covering seeds with ash fertilizer are generally adopted for fertilization. The wheat that has been sown throughout the province has all implemented reasonable close planting, and has generally adopted fine seeds such as "Nanda 2419" and "Dwarf Grain Multi". When sowing rapeseed in various places, the seedling height of early sowing is more than one inch due to the vigorous promotion of the square seedling method.

Jiangsu

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 13th - Various places in Jiangsu Province are seizing the agricultural time, concentrating superior labor, rushing to sow three wheats, and striving to complete the sowing in a timely manner. As of the 6th, 6.86 million mu of crops such as three wheats, broad beans, and peas have been sown throughout the province.

Due to the tight autumn sowing season, the large sowing area, and the high requirements for specifications and quality, various places have concentrated superior labor to invest in autumn sowing. Xuzhou Prefecture concentrated 80% of the labor force, 80% of the leading cadres, and 80% of the Party and League members to invest in autumn sowing. As of the 8th, 2.67 million mu have been sown, and the daily progress has increased from 150,000 mu to more than 300,000 mu. Xin'yi County adopted the method of three concentrations of labor force, animal power, and tools, so that the daily progress of cultivated land in the county increased from 15,000 mu in early September to more than 35,000 mu. Liutang Commune in Guannan County divided the more than 7,000 laborers in the entire commune who invested in autumn sowing into four lines: transporting fertilizer and spreading fertilizer, deep plowing and deep turning, managing ridges and digging ditches, and sowing. The reasonable use of labor made each process closely linked, and the sowing progress was greatly accelerated.

At the same time, various places have also carried out red flag appraisal competitions between teams, groups, and people. Through the competition, the autumn sowing movement has been continuously pushed to a new climax. (Attached picture)
