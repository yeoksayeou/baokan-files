Xinhua News Agency, 14th - Our country's winter wheat sowing work has fully begun. Currently, the sowing work in the main wheat-producing areas such as the Yellow River, Huai River plains, and North China has formed a high tide, and wheat sowing in the areas south of the Yangtze River has also begun one after another. In the northwest region, where the wheat sowing season is earlier, the sowing work is nearing completion. Since late September, many places in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, and other provinces have experienced rainfall. The people's communes in these areas are seizing the favorable opportunity after the rain to accelerate the sowing progress.

In the high tide of the whole party and all people engaging in agriculture and large-scale food production movement, the situation of this year's wheat sowing work is very good. The wheat sowing preparation work in various places is generally adequate. All localities have strengthened their leadership, concentrated more labor, and received strong support from industry, commerce, culture, and education. During the summer harvest this year, many areas' people's communes summarized the experience of increasing wheat production over the years. After the summer harvest, while strengthening the management of autumn-ripening crops, various places concentrated a certain amount of manpower and animal power to carry out fallow tillage and large-scale accumulation and production of fertilizer, rush to make and repair autumn sowing tools, select and test seeds, and train a group of sowing technicians. Once the autumn sowing season arrived at "White Dew," many wheat-producing areas' people's communes immediately put the concentrated superior labor force into the first line of wheat sowing while doing a good job in autumn harvesting. Leading cadres at all levels also went to the fields one after another, participating in sowing on the spot, commanding sowing, strengthening specific leadership of sowing work, and ensuring that various measures are quickly implemented. At present, each wheat region is carrying out large-scale inspections, appraisals, and competitions, promoting advanced experience, and grasping weak links to more comprehensively and better complete the wheat sowing task.

In the wheat sowing, all regions have further implemented the policy of both multiple planting and multiple harvesting and high yield and multiple harvesting. Hebei, Hunan, Xinjiang, Sichuan, and other provinces and regions are actively expanding the wheat sowing area. At the same time, all localities are trying every means to improve the sowing method, cultivate a large number of high-yield fields, and strive to lay a good foundation for high yield from the beginning of sowing. Some rice-producing areas in the south that previously planted less wheat have also expanded the wheat sowing area this year, striving for a double leap forward in wheat and rice. Many people's communes have made detailed plans for striving for high-yield and high-yield squares in the wheat sowing work, and have increased efforts in deep plowing, fertilization, and seed selection to strive for high yield. Hebei, Henan, Gansu, and other provinces are also focusing on low-yield fields in wheat sowing, striving for high yields in every field to achieve comprehensive and balanced production increase.

According to inspections in various places, the quality of wheat sowing this year is generally good. In the sowing, all localities have further implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture in accordance with local conditions. Most wheat fields have been finely cultivated and leveled before sowing, base fertilizer has also been increased, attention has been paid to moisture retention, the amount of seed sown is appropriate, and some seeds have been soaked and treated with pesticides.

Now that Cold Dew (October 8) has passed, the next solar term is Frost's Descent (October 23). This period is the busy season for wheat sowing in the main wheat-producing areas of our country. Therefore, all regions are racing against time and striving to complete the sowing task in a timely manner. At present, the main crop wheat in North China is about to be finished, and the rush to plant the replanted and late-planted wheat has begun. This year, due to the large area of autumn-ripening crops, there are more replanted and late-planted wheat than in previous years, so the arrangement of stubble must be quickly and properly resolved. In addition to using various methods to promote early maturity and early stubble of autumn-ripening crops, many people's communes also implement intercropping and interplanting of wheat on the premise of ensuring sowing quality, and sow replanted and late-planted wheat in advance to catch up with early-planted wheat.

Since late September, many places that were previously affected by drought have successively experienced rainfall, which has provided relatively good soil moisture conditions for wheat sowing, and various places have seized the favorable opportunity after the rain to accelerate the sowing progress. However, at present, some areas are still experiencing drought. The people's communes in these areas are continuing to sow with a tenacious fighting spirit. At the same time, all localities are generally paying attention to giving full play to the role of existing water conservancy projects, trying every means to increase water storage, and preparing more water sources for winter irrigation and spring irrigation.

Shandong

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 13th - Various places in Shandong Province are carrying out a blitz sowing of late-stubble wheat. According to statistics on October 10, the wheat sown in the province has accounted for 50% of the autumn planting plan. Yantai Prefecture, which has a faster progress, has completed more than 70% of the sowing plan.

In order to speed up the wheat sowing progress and sow the late-stubble wheat as early as possible, Party committees at all levels in Shandong continue to transfer a large number of cadres to go deep into the first line of production to help communes and teams specifically arrange labor and animal power. Under the specific help of Cui Zhenhua, Secretary of the Zibo Prefectural Committee of the CPC, the number of people participating in autumn planting in Zouping County increased from 110,000 to more than 130,000, and the animal power increased from 6,000 to 7,000, so that the daily sowing progress rapidly increased from more than 15,000 mu to 23,000 mu. The Party Committee of Pingyuan Commune in Licheng County deployed five secretaries and eight standing committee members to go deep into five brigades including Qiaotou and Gengjia to help each team arrange labor and animal power, so that the daily autumn sowing progress of the entire commune increased from 2,000 mu to more than 3,000 mu.

This year, there is less early-stubble and more late-stubble in autumn planting in Shandong Province, and it is also the season for harvesting late autumn. Harvesting and planting are squeezed together. In response to this situation, various places have unified arrangements for labor and animal power by summarizing experience, and adopted the method of close integration of harvesting and planting, as well as "assembly line operations" such as harvesting, transporting, plowing, and planting, to speed up the autumn planting speed. Shifuo Commune in Shouzhang County mobilized the masses to summarize the autumn planting experience, and implemented a series of three operations of plowing, harrowing, and sowing. The daily autumn planting progress increased from the original 700 mu to 1,200 mu. Fangzhai Commune in Guan County divided the labor force and animal power of the entire commune into five processes: harvesting, transporting, plowing, harrowing, and planting, and implemented assembly line operations. People did not travel empty-handed, and vehicles were not empty, which not only accelerated harvesting and transportation, but also increased the daily autumn planting progress from 700 mu to more than 1,500 mu.

Shaanxi

People's Daily, Xi'an, 13th - While expanding the autumn sowing area, people's communes in various places in Shaanxi Province are actively expanding the area of high-yield wheat fields.

Wheat sowing work in Shaanxi Province has entered the later stage. As of the 11th, more than 90% of the sowing has been completed in Yan'an and Yulin areas, 70% to 80% in counties and cities on the Weibei Plateau, and the sowing work in Guanzhong Plain and Southern Shaanxi, where the solar terms are later, has also been fully launched. The province sends out more than 2 million laborers every day to rush to sow wheat, and the daily progress has increased by two times compared with the first ten days of October and 60% compared with the same period last year.

This year, the area of high-yield wheat fields in Shaanxi Province is larger than in previous years, and the high-yield wheat fields established in the province account for about 40% of the total wheat field area. In the vigorous development of the high-yield wheat movement, various places are trying every means to improve the sowing quality of high-yield fields. Hù County has generally established model fields in each high-yield square. Zhang Shidi, the first secretary of the county party committee, personally went deep into the high-yield square of Chengguan Commune, and established a six-mu model field with cadres and technicians. This model field has a great influence on the surrounding 50,000 mu high-yield square. Every time a measure is implemented, many commune members in the surrounding areas come to visit and learn, and cultivate high-yield fields according to the standards of the model field, so that all the high-yield fields basically reach the standards of the model field. The high-yield wheat fields in Dali County account for 52% of the total wheat area, an expansion of 1.2 times compared with last year. The high-yield fields have all achieved one transformation (orchardization) and three sufficient (sufficient base fertilizer, sufficient fine seeds, sufficient row planters).

At present, there is widespread rainfall in Shaanxi. All localities are adjusting labor and animal power, seizing the opportunity, and rushing to sow wheat.

Anhui

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 13th - A vigorous autumn plowing and autumn sowing movement has been fully launched in Anhui Province. At present, nearly six million people in the province have invested in autumn plowing and autumn sowing and activities for sending fertilizer and accumulating fertilizer for autumn sowing; and more than 6.2 million mu of food crops such as wheat, barley, and peas, and 1.3 million mu of rapeseed have been sown.

This year, the province has mobilized more than 60,000 cadres to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, of which nearly 50% of the cadres went to poor teams and backward teams to help work. After these cadres went down, they greatly strengthened the weak links in agricultural production, so that autumn plowing and autumn sowing work were quickly launched and the sowing quality was improved. This year, there is relatively more base fertilizer applied for autumn sowing in various places in the province, and the fertilization method has also been greatly improved. In the areas north of the Huai River, in addition to applying base fertilizer, many areas also use soil fertilizer to mix seeds and sow with manure. In the areas south of the Huai River, methods such as covering seeds with ash fertilizer are generally adopted for fertilization. The wheat that has been sown throughout the province has all implemented reasonable close planting, and has generally adopted fine seeds such as "Nanda 2419" and "Dwarf Grain Multi". When sowing rapeseed in various places, the seedling height of early sowing is more than one inch due to the vigorous promotion of the square seedling method.

Jiangsu

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 13th - Various places in Jiangsu Province are seizing the agricultural time, concentrating superior labor, rushing to sow three wheats, and striving to complete the sowing in a timely manner. As of the 6th, 6.86 million mu of crops such as three wheats, broad beans, and peas have been sown throughout the province.

Due to the tight autumn sowing season, the large sowing area, and the high requirements for specifications and quality, various places have concentrated superior labor to invest in autumn sowing. Xuzhou Prefecture concentrated 80% of the labor force, 80% of the leading cadres, and 80% of the Party and League members to invest in autumn sowing. As of the 8th, 2.67 million mu have been sown, and the daily progress has increased from 150,000 mu to more than 300,000 mu. Xin'yi County adopted the method of three concentrations of labor force, animal power, and tools, so that the daily progress of cultivated land in the county increased from 15,000 mu in early September to more than 35,000 mu. Liutang Commune in Guannan County divided the more than 7,000 laborers in the entire commune who invested in autumn sowing into four lines: transporting fertilizer and spreading fertilizer, deep plowing and deep turning, managing ridges and digging ditches, and sowing. The reasonable use of labor made each process closely linked, and the sowing progress was greatly accelerated.

At the same time, various places have also carried out red flag appraisal competitions between teams, groups, and people. Through the competition, the autumn sowing movement has been continuously pushed to a new climax. (Attached picture)

    全国各地加强领导集中力量运用历年增产经验得到各方大力支援
    进度快　质量高　小麦播种形势好
    山东陕西安徽江苏抓紧时机夺取
    新华社14日讯　我国冬小麦播种工作已经全面展开。现在，黄河、淮河平原和华北等主要产麦区播种工作已经形成高潮，长江以南地区的小麦播种也陆续开始，种麦季节较早的西北地区，播种工作已接近完成。9月下旬以来，河北、山东、河南、山西等省许多地方先后降雨，这些地区的人民公社正抓住雨后的有利时机，加快播种进度。
    在全党全民大办农业，大办粮食运动的高潮中，今年小麦播种工作的形势很好。各地种麦准备工作一般作得比较充分，各地都加强了领导力量，集中了比较多的劳力，并且得到了工业、商业、文教等各方面的大力支援。今年夏收时，许多地区的人民公社总结了历年小麦增产的经验，夏收结束后，各地在加强秋熟作物管理的同时，就集中一定的人力、畜力，进行伏耕和大积大造肥料，抢制抢修秋播工具，挑选和试验种子，并且训练了一批播种技术人员。秋种季节“白露”一到，许多产麦区的人民公社在作好秋收工作的同时就立刻把集中的优势劳力投入种麦第一线。各级领导干部也纷纷下田，在现场参加种麦，指挥种麦，加强种麦工作的具体领导，保证了各项措施迅速落实。目前，各麦区正开展大检查，大评比，大竞赛，推广先进经验，狠抓薄弱环节，以便更全面地、更好地完成种麦任务。
    各地在种麦中，都进一步贯彻执行了多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针。河北、湖南、新疆、四川等省、区都积极扩大小麦播种面积，同时各地还千方百计地改进播种方法，大量培植丰产田，力争从播种开头这一关就为高产打好基础。南方一些过去种麦较少的水稻产区，今年也扩大了小麦播种面积，争取麦、稻双跃进。很多人民公社在种麦工作中对争取高产的丰产方，都作了详细规划，并且从深耕、施肥、选种等方面加工加码，争取高产。河北、河南、甘肃等省在种麦中还大抓低产田，力争块块丰产，以达到全面平衡增产。
    据各地检查，今年小麦播种质量一般良好。在播种中，各地都因地制宜地进一步贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，大部分麦田在播种以前进行了精细耕耙和平整土地，基肥也有了增加，注意了保墒，下种量适当，部分种子进行了浸种和药物拌种。
    现在，寒露（10月8日）已过，下个节令就是霜降（10月23日），这个期间正是我国主要产麦区种麦的大忙季节。因此，各地都在抢时间、争分秒，力争适时完成播种任务。现在，华北地区的正茬麦已快种完，开始抢种回茬、晚茬麦。今年由于秋熟作物面积大，回茬麦、晚茬麦比往年增加较多，所以必须迅速地、妥善地解决茬口安排问题。许多人民公社除用各种办法促使秋收作物早熟，早腾茬外，还在保证播种质量的前提下，实行间种套种小麦，把回茬麦、晚茬麦提前播种，争取回茬、晚茬麦赶上早茬麦。
    9月下旬以来，许多以前受旱的地方先后降雨，使种麦获得了比较良好的墒情，各地抓紧雨后的有利时机，加快了播种进度。但是，目前还有部分地区有旱情，这些地区的人民公社正继续以顽强的斗志，抗旱播种。同时，各地普遍注意充分发挥现有水利工程的作用，千方百计增加蓄水量，为冬灌和春灌准备更多的水源。
    山东
    据新华社济南13日电　山东省各地突击播种晚茬麦。到10月10日统计，全省播种的小麦已占秋种计划50％。进度较快的烟台专区已完成播种计划70％以上。
    为了加快种麦进度，及早种好晚茬麦，山东各地各级党委都继续抽调大批干部深入到生产第一线，帮助社、队具体安排劳力、畜力。邹平县在中共淄博地委书记崔振华的具体帮助下，全县参加秋种的劳力由十一万人增加到十三万多人，畜力由六千犋增加到七千犋，使播种日进度由一万五千多亩迅速增加到二万三千亩。历城县平原公社党委五名书记、八名常委，分别深入到桥头、耿家等五个大队，帮助各队安排劳力、畜力，使全社的秋种日进度由两千亩增加到三千多亩。
    今年山东省秋种早茬少，晚茬多，目前又正是收晚秋的时节，收和种挤在一起。各地针对这一情况，通过总结经验，统一安排劳力、畜力，采取了收种紧密结合，以及收、运、耕、种等“流水作业”的办法，以加快秋种的速度。寿张县石佛公社发动群众总结秋种经验，实行耕、耙、播一连三作，秋种日进度由原来的七百亩增加到一千二百亩。冠县房寨公社把全社劳动力和畜力分成收、运、耕、耙、种等五道工序，实行流水作业，人不空行，车不空载，不仅使收割、运输加快，而且秋种日进度由七百亩猛增到一千五百多亩。
    陕西
    本报西安13日电  陕西省各地人民公社在扩大秋播面积的同时，积极扩大小麦丰产田的面积。
    陕西省小麦播种工作已进入后期。截至11日止，延安、榆林地区已播种90％以上，渭北高原各县市，播种70％到80％；节令较晚的关中平川和陕南地区播种工作也全面展开。全省每天出动二百多万劳动力抢播小麦，日进度比10月上旬提高了二倍，比去年同时期提高了60％。
    今年，陕西省小麦丰产田比往年面积大，全省建立的小麦丰产田约占麦田总面积的40％。各地在大搞小麦丰产运动中，千方百计提高丰产田的播种质量。鄠县在各个丰产方内普遍建立了样板田。县委第一书记张士第亲自深入城关公社丰产方，和干部、技术人员建立了一块六亩大的样板田，这块样板田对周围五万亩丰产方的影响很大，每贯彻一项措施时，周围的许多社员都来参观学习，并按照样板田的标准进行培育丰产田，因而使全部丰产田基本达到样板田的标准。大荔县的小麦丰产田，占小麦总面积的52％，比去年扩大了一点二倍。丰产田都做到了一化（园田化）、三足（底肥足，良种足，条播机足）。
    目前，陕西各地普遍降雨。各地纷纷调整劳力和畜力，抓紧时机，突击抢种小麦。
    安徽
    据新华社合肥13日电　一个轰轰烈烈的秋耕秋种运动，已在安徽省全面展开。目前全省有近六百万人投入秋耕秋种和为秋种送肥、积肥活动；并已播种小麦、大麦、豌豆等粮食作物六百二十多万亩，油菜一百三十万亩。
    今年，全省先后动员了六万多名干部，加强农业生产的领导，其中有近50％的干部是到穷队和后进队帮助工作。这些干部下去以后，大大加强了农业生产的薄弱环节，使秋耕秋种工作迅速展开，播种质量提高。今年全省各地秋种施用的基肥比较多，施肥方法也有很大改进。淮河以北地区，除了施了基肥以外，不少地区还用土化肥拌种和带粪耩种。淮河以南地区一般都采取灰粪盖籽等办法施肥。全省已播的小麦，都实行了合理密植，并且普遍采用“南大二四一九”和“矮粒多”等良种。各地在播种油菜时，由于大力推广了方块育苗法，早播的苗高已有一寸多。
    江苏
    据新华社南京13日电　江苏省各地抓紧农时，集中优势劳力，抢种三麦，争取适时完成播种。截至6日为止，全省已播下三麦、蚕豆、豌豆等作物六百八十六万亩。
    由于秋播季节紧，播种面积大，规格质量要求高，各地都集中优势劳力投入秋播。徐州专区集中80％的劳力、80％的领导骨干、80％的党团员投入秋播，到8日为止，已播二百六十七万亩，日进度由十五万亩增加到三十多万亩。新沂县采取劳力、畜力、工具三集中的办法，使全县耕地的日进度由9月上旬的一万五千亩增加到三万五千多亩。灌南县六塘公社把全公社投入秋播的七千多个劳力划分为运肥布肥、深耕深翻、理墒挖沟、播种等四条线，合理使用劳力，使各道工序环环扣紧，播种进度大大加快。
    同时，各地还开展了队与队、组与组、人与人的红旗评比竞赛，通过竞赛，不断把秋播运动推向新高潮。（附图片）
