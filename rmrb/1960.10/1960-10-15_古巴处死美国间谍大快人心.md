    Cuba's Execution of American Spy Greatly Pleases the People
    Revolutionary Tribunal Simultaneously Sentences Two Groups of Armed Bandits Who Landed from the Sea and Rebelled in the Mountains
    A Few American Spies and Armed Bandits Remain at Large, Militia and Revolutionary Armed Forces are Tenaciously Pursuing Them
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 13th: The Revolutionary Tribunal of Santiago, Cuba, announced this morning that it had carried out the death penalty on seven Batista tyranny special agents and an American imperialist spy, American Anthony Zarba (formerly translated as Tony Salvadore). These eight people were members of a group of armed counter-revolutionary bandits who landed in Oriente Province on the 5th of this month from the United States.

    Thousands of people gathered in front of the court building shouted: Execute, execute, execute! during the sentencing process. They cheered long live the revolution, sang the national anthem and the march of the "July 26th Movement", and shouted in unison "Cuba yes, Yankees no!"
    The sentences were carried out after the Supreme Judge rejected the appeals filed by the criminals.
    In addition to the above eight invaders who were sentenced to death, fourteen were sentenced to thirty years in prison; another three criminals were sentenced to twenty years, ten years, and two years respectively. Two peasants who were deceived by the counter-revolutionaries were acquitted.
    American spy Anthony Zarba confessed during interrogation that the above-mentioned group of invaders came from Miami, USA. He also said that they were recruited in Miami by another American, Robert Fuller, the son of an American plantation owner who owned land in Cuba.
    Of the twenty-seven invaders who landed in Oriente Province, five are still at large, including three Americans: Alan Thompson, Paul Hughes, and Robert Fuller. Cuban peasant militia are cooperating with the Revolutionary Armed Forces to tenaciously pursue them. A militiaman, Henaro Fuentes, who is pursuing these invaders said, "One thing these invaders should realize is that they can enter our territory, but they can never escape. Let those special agents and mercenaries come, we are waiting for them here! We will drag them down from the mountains and execute them!"
    Another militiaman, Alto Songo, said: This battle is a practice for us to search for bandits, from which we have been further trained.
    Militiaman Julian Rivera said that the United States may even send the Seventh Fleet, but it will never get through. Were we given guns to play with? We believe that victory will belong to us.

    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 13th: The Revolutionary Tribunal of Santa Clara, Cuba, has given the counter-revolutionaries who carried out armed rebellion in the Escambray Mountains of Las Villas Province with American weapons the severe punishment they deserved. Five bandits were sentenced to death and executed by the militia last night.
    Among the five sentenced to death, three were bandit leaders: Plinio Prieto, Sinesio Valls, and Porfirio Humberto Ramirez Ruiz. The Supreme Revolutionary Tribunal rejected their appeals. The other two criminals sentenced to death were also guilty of bloody persecution of peasants and participating in the killing of a captain of the Revolutionary Armed Forces.
    Seventy rebels were sentenced to thirty years in prison, and other rebels were sentenced to twenty years and fifteen years respectively. A total of one hundred and eighty criminals were sentenced to prison terms.
    A juvenile who participated in the rebellion was sent to a reform camp. In addition, the court released four peasants who had been deceived into joining the rebellion.
    An American, Ricardo Picolaro, who participated in the rebellion was sentenced to twenty years in prison. Picolaro confessed that he was a member of the American police department and the American navy. When he was arrested, maps of the Escambray Mountains and a list of counter-revolutionary leaders were seized from him. He had come to Cuba three times this year. The first time he was arrested by the Cuban authorities for carrying out counter-revolutionary activities and was later released. The second time he sneaked into the Cuban interior, where he was arrested again. On the 1st of this month, he came to Cuba again, and even the "New York Times" correspondent in Havana admitted in a message that he had come to Cuba again to "join the anti-Castro rebels in the Escambray Mountains."
    The trial of the rebels proved that the United States directly participated in this counter-revolutionary armed rebellion. Major Manuel Fajardo, who was responsible for clearing out the counter-revolutionary bandits in the Escambray Mountains, testified during the trial that on September 29, a four-engine plane that took off from Miami, USA, dropped weapons in the Escambray Mountains.
    Yesterday, people from all walks of life in Santa Clara held demonstrations and mass rallies demanding the death penalty for the counter-revolutionaries. The United Federation of University Students of Oriente Province and Las Villas Province issued statements respectively, supporting the verdicts of the revolutionary tribunal, especially the verdict against Porfirio Humberto Ramirez Ruiz. He used to be the chairman of the United Federation of University Students of Las Villas Province. The students declared him a traitor to the motherland and to the university students.

    坚决砍断美帝国主义侵略者的魔爪
    古巴处死美国间谍大快人心
    革命法庭同时分别判处从海上登陆和在山区叛乱的两批武装匪徒
    还有少数美国间谍和武装匪徒在逃民兵和起义军正在顽强追击
    新华社哈瓦那13日电　古巴圣地亚哥的革命法庭今天清晨宣布：革命法庭已经对七个巴蒂斯塔暴政的特务以及一个美帝国主义的间谍、美国人安东尼·扎尔巴（前译托尼·萨尔瓦德）执行了死刑判决。这八个人是本月5日在奥连特省登陆的来自美国的一批武装反革命匪帮中的成员。
    聚集在法庭大厦前面的数以千计的人在宣判过程中高呼：枪毙、枪毙、枪毙！他们欢呼革命万岁，高唱国歌和“七月二十六日运动”的进行曲，并且同声高呼“要古巴，不要美国佬！”的口号。
    判决是在最高法官拒绝了罪犯们提出的上诉之后执行的。
    入侵者中除了上述八人被判处死刑外，还有十四名被判处三十年有期徒刑；另外三名罪犯分别被判处二十年、十年、两年等有期徒刑。受反革命分子欺骗的两个农民被免罪。
    美国间谍安东尼·扎尔巴在审问中供认：上述一批入侵者是来自美国的迈阿密。他还说，他们是在迈阿密被另一个美国人罗伯特·富勒——一个在古巴拥有土地的美国大庄园主的儿子召募的。
    在奥连特省登陆的二十七个入侵者中，现在还有五个在逃，其中有三个是美国人：阿兰·汤普森、保罗·休格斯和罗伯特·富勒。古巴农民民兵正配合起义军对他们进行顽强的追击。追击这些入侵者的一位民兵赫纳罗·富恩特斯说，“有一件事是这些侵略者应该认识到的：他们可以进入我国领土，但是他们休想再逃出去。让那些特务和雇佣兵来吧，我们在这里等着他们！我们要把他们从山上抓下来枪毙！”
    另一位民兵阿耳托·松戈说：这次战斗对我们说来是搜查匪徒的一次实习，从中我们进一步受到了锻炼。
    民兵胡列安·里维拉说，美国甚至可能派第七舰队来，但它也休想通过。难道给我们枪是为了玩的吗？我们相信胜利必属我们。
    新华社哈瓦那13日电　古巴圣克拉拉革命法庭已经对手执美国武器在拉斯维利亚斯省埃斯坎布拉伊山区进行武装叛乱的反革命分子给以应得的严厉惩处。五名匪徒被判死刑，已由民兵在昨晚执行枪决。
    被判处死刑的五人中，有三人是匪首，他们是：普利尼奥·普烈托，西内西奥·瓦耳斯和波尔菲里奥·伦贝尔托·拉米雷斯·鲁伊斯。最高革命法庭驳回了他们的上诉。其他两名被判处死刑的罪犯还犯有血腥迫害农民和参加杀害一名起义军上尉的罪行。
    有七十名叛乱分子被判处三十年徒刑，另外一些叛乱分子分别被判处二十年和十五年徒刑。总共有一百八十名罪犯被判徒刑。
    一名受审判的少年被送往改造营。另外，法庭释放了四个被骗参加叛乱的农民。
    一名参加叛乱的美国人里卡德·皮科拉罗被判二十年徒刑。皮科拉罗供认他是美国警察局和美国海军的成员。当他被捕时，从他身上缴获了埃斯坎布拉伊山区的地图和反革命头子的名单。今年他曾三次来古巴。第一次由于进行反革命活动被古巴当局逮捕，后被释放。第二次他潜入古巴内地，在那里他又被捕。本月1日，他又来到古巴，连“纽约时报”驻哈瓦那的记者在一条消息中也承认他再次来到古巴是为了“在埃斯坎布拉伊山区加入反卡斯特罗的叛军”。
    对叛乱分子的审讯证明美国直接参预了这起反革命武装叛乱。负责清剿埃斯坎布拉伊山区反革命匪帮工作的曼努埃尔·法哈多少校在审讯中作证说，9月29日，一架从美国迈阿密起飞的四引擎飞机在埃斯坎布拉伊山区投下了武器。
    昨天，圣克拉拉的各界居民举行了示威游行和群众大会，要求判处反革命分子死刑。奥连特省和拉斯维利亚斯省的大学生联合会分别发表声明，支持革命法庭的判决，特别是对波尔菲里奥·伦贝尔托·拉米雷斯·鲁伊斯的判决。他过去曾经是拉斯维利亚斯省大学生联合会主席。学生们宣布他是祖国和大学生中的叛徒。
