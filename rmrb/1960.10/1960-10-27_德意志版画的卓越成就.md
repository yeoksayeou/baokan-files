The Outstanding Achievements of German Prints
Hu Man

    To celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the "Six Hundred Years of German Prints Exhibition" and the "Modern Prints Exhibition of the German Democratic Republic" held in Beijing, exhibited many precious masterpieces, including hand-pulled prints and original works by many famous artists from ancient to modern times. This allows us to systematically understand the development of German print art and the great achievements of modern German print art.
    In the history of world art, printmaking originated relatively early in Germany. Various prints such as woodcuts, copperplate engravings, etchings, and lithographs were mostly created by laborers, pioneered by folk artists, metal engraving craftsmen, and printing workers. This is confirmed by concrete historical facts in the history of German printmaking art. Throughout history, Germany has produced great printmakers, starting with the great artist Dürer in the Renaissance and the 16th century, all the way to the great proletarian artist Käthe Kollwitz in the 20th century, all of whom are world-renowned. They created styles with distinctive national characteristics, reflected the lives and struggles of the people, and possessed profound ideological content and novel artistic expression. Because printmaking art is easy to "reach far and wide," German artists throughout history have made greater contributions to the working people of their motherland. German prints include various genres such as figure paintings, portraits, landscapes, still lifes, and animal paintings, with rich content and forms, and have contributed to the development of German art history and world art history. Starting with the great proletarian artist Käthe Kollwitz, they have made even greater contributions to the cause of socialism. In this exhibition, we can see the woodcut works of the famous German painter Dürer, his "Samson Slaying the Lion," which uses ancient German folk tales as its theme and praises heroic figures with concise and solid brushwork, inspiring the people's heroic fighting spirit. In the 19th century, the great realist artist Menzel emerged, faithfully depicting the life of his era with precise artistic skills. In 1956, the National Museum of the German Democratic Republic held an exhibition of Menzel's original drawings in Beijing, which was deeply loved and valued by the Chinese people. This time, his rare and extremely detailed woodcut illustrations on historical themes are exhibited, which have high value both as historical research and as a reference for creative methods.
    This exhibition also includes many etchings and lithographs by the painter Liebermann. This painter of the French Barbizon school strongly displayed the temperament and perseverance of the German working people in his creations. He described the atmosphere of the German countryside and wilderness with fresh plein air painting. Among the exhibited works are also Klinger's literary etching series "In an Extraordinary March" and "A Mother," which reflect the social problems of his era with highly realistic artistic techniques. As art that expresses the spirit of the times and ideology, it has greatly influenced later painters.
    The great proletarian artist Käthe Kollwitz, during her lifetime, had her works introduced by Mr. Lu Xun, which left a huge impact on Chinese revolutionary art. This exhibition includes her masterpieces such as the "Workers' Uprising" series and "Worker's Wife." The strong and powerful images of fighting German workers in the works, with profound themes and creative spirit, will forever remain in our hearts.
    The German Democratic Republic not only protects Germany's national heritage, but also modern artists inherit and develop the excellent traditions of their national art, creating works to reflect socialist construction and revolution. Modern art exhibitions held in our country in the past have been well received by the Chinese people. This rich and colorful modern print exhibition includes many new creations from the past one or two years, marking the new achievements of the artists of the German Democratic Republic. This modern print exhibition shows the diversification of various genres and styles. Many outstanding works depicting the lives and thoughts of productive laborers are deeply impressive. For example, Mohr's etching "Steelworkers" depicts a group of steelworkers intently watching the arrival of the steel tapping process. The composition is concise, and the character images are carefully depicted and vividly portrayed. Minschu's lithograph "Female Welder" portrays the solemn and strong image of a typical working woman with powerful lines. Nagel's lithograph "Armed Workers" depicts the scene of workers patrolling day and night with their daily armed defenses, expressing the theme of the working class's great power of political consciousness in defending the motherland, focusing on the portrayal of character images, and expressing the theme very clearly.
    This time, many excellent works were also exhibited depicting the scenery of socialist construction projects, such as Betz's etching "Power Plant," "Bridge Construction," Ducholsky's etching "Elbe Port," and David's "Excavator," Dehn's etching "Stones Supporting the Construction of Rostock Seaport," etc. Many artists use original printmaking art to express the great construction cause of socialism.
    In terms of color lithographs, Biruma's "May Tree" and "Streets with Banners" are full of the joy and enthusiastic atmosphere of revolutionary festivals. These are new genre paintings with rich German folk styles. Beganda depicts the happy life of socialist society with novel compositions and concise brushwork, such as "Youth," "Snow," and "Spinning Top," giving us a feeling of comfort.
    Among the modern works, there are also works created by artists from the German Democratic Republic who visited China and sketched during their travels. These works naturally reveal the deep friendship between the two peoples. For example, Shen Guo's color woodcut "Chinese Girl" depicts a young female student doing her homework at her desk, with Qi Baishi's painting hanging in the background. Baltcha's "Chinese College Student" depicts the face of a healthy new person who combines study and labor. Herlai's ink and light color sketch "PLA Soldier" depicts the heroic spirit of our ordinary soldier. Mintz's ink painting "Great Wall Edge" depicts the magnificent Badaling with freehand brushwork and a poetic sense full of stern realism. Bachi's woodcut, titled "Chinese Sailing Ship," depicts a ferry bridge connecting many ships across the river, with a very beautiful composition and a very lyrical conception.
    The new creation of German prints is developing extremely rapidly. Many works have their own unique features. These two exhibitions held at the same time concentrate and display the outstanding achievements of German print art. I wish the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and German peoples will last forever!

    德意志版画的卓越成就
    胡蛮
    为庆祝德意志民主共和国建国十一周年，在北京举行的《德意志六百年版画展览》和《德意志民主共和国现代版画展览》，展出了许多珍贵的杰作，其中包括从古代到现代的许多著名艺术家的手拓本和原作，使我们能够系统地了解到德国版画艺术发展的面貌和德国现代版画艺术的巨大成就。
    在世界艺术史当中，版画艺术在德国创造较早。各种版画如木刻、铜版、腐蚀版和石版画等，很多都出自劳动者之手，都是由民间艺人、金属雕刻工匠和印刷工人所首创，这是从德国版画艺术史上有确切史实足以证明的。德国历代伟大的版画家辈出，从文艺复兴时期、十六世纪伟大的艺术家丢勒开始，直到二十世纪无产阶级的伟大艺术家珂勒惠支，都是举世周知的。他们创造了富有民族特点的风格，反映了人民的生活和斗争，具有深刻的思想内容和新颖的艺术表现。由于版画艺术易于“行远及众”，所以德国历代艺术家对于他们祖国劳动人民的贡献也较大。德国版画包括人物画、肖像、风景、静物和动物画各种体裁，内容和形式都很丰富，在德国艺术发展史上和对世界艺术史上都是有贡献的。从无产阶级的伟大艺术家珂勒惠支开始，在社会主义事业上更有着伟大的贡献。在这次展出的版画中，我们可以看到德国著名画家丢勒的木刻作品，他的《萨姆逊战胜雄狮》，以古代德国盛传的民间故事为题材，用简练坚实的笔法歌颂英雄人物，启发人民的英勇斗志。到十九世纪，又产生了伟大的现实主义的艺术家门采尔，他以精确的艺术技巧，忠实地表现了他的那个时代的生活。1956年德意志民主共和国国家博物馆在北京举行过门采尔的素描原作展览会，深为我国人民热爱和重视。这次展出了罕见的他的极其细致的以历史为题材的木刻插图，无论是作为历史的研究或对创作方法的借鉴，都有很高的价值。
    在这次展览会当中，还展出了画家里勃曼的许多腐蚀版和石版画，这位法国巴比松派的画家，在创作上强烈地显示着德国劳动人民的气质和坚韧不拔的性格，他以新鲜的外光描写了德国的农村和原野的气氛。在展出作品中，还有克林格尔的富有文学性的腐蚀版组画《在不平凡的三月里》和《一个母亲》，以有高度的现实主义的艺术技巧，反映了他的那个时代的社会问题，作为表现时代性和思想性的艺术，给予后来的画家以很大的影响。
    伟大的无产阶级的艺术家珂勒惠支，当她在世的时候，她的作品经鲁迅先生的介绍，对中国革命美术留下了巨大的影响。这次展出的有她的《职工暴动》组画和《工人的妻子》等杰作。作品中坚强有力的战斗的德国工人形象，具有深刻主题思想和创造精神，永远留在我们的心头。
    德意志民主共和国不仅保护了德国的民族遗产，并且现代的艺术家还继承和发展了自己民族艺术的优良传统，为反映社会主义建设和革命而创作，历次在我国举办的现代美展，深受我国人民欢迎。在这次丰富多彩的现代版画展览中，包括近一两年间的许多新创作，标志着德意志民主共和国艺术家们的新成就。这次现代版画展，显现了各种体裁和风格的多样化。描写生产劳动者的生活和思想感情的许多杰出作品，给人以深刻印象。如莫尔的腐蚀版《炼钢工人》群像，描写一组炼钢工人正在凝神注视着出钢火候的到来，构图简洁，刻划人物形象谨严、神情活现。明许的石版画《女电焊工》肖像，以强有力的线条塑造了典型的劳动妇女庄严、坚强的形象。纳格尔的石版画《武装的工人们》，描写工人们日日夜夜以自己的日常的武装防御巡查的情景，表现了工人阶级为保卫祖国的政治觉悟的巨大力量的主题，从人物形象的刻画上着眼，把主题表现得非常明确。
    描写社会主义建设工程的风景题材，这次也展出了许多优秀作品，例如：柏茨的腐蚀版《发电厂》、《桥梁建设》，杜霍尔斯基的腐蚀版《易北河港》和大卫的《掘土机》，德恩的腐蚀版《支援建设罗斯托克海港的石头》等等，许多美术家以富有独创性的版画艺术表现出社会主义的伟大建设事业。
    在套色石版画方面，毕鲁沫的《五月树》和《旗帜飘扬的街道》，充满了革命节日的欢欣鼓舞和热烈的气氛。这是富有德意志民间风格的新的风俗画创作。贝干达以新颖的构图和简洁的笔法描绘了社会主义社会的幸福生活，如《青年》、《雪中》和《转陀螺》等等，给我们以心情舒畅的感觉。
    在现代作品当中，还展出了德意志民主共和国美术家们到我国访问旅行写生的作品。这些作品自然地流露着两国人民的深厚友谊。如：申果的套色木刻《中国女孩》，描写一个青年女学生在书桌前做作业，背景上还挂着齐白石的画。巴尔特查的《中国大学生》描写一个健康的学习与劳动相结合的新人的面貌。赫莱的水墨淡彩的速写《解放军战士》描写了我们的普通一兵的英雄气概。明茨的水墨画《长城边》以写意的笔法和富有严峻的现实感的诗意描写了雄伟的八达岭。巴契的木刻，题为《中国大帆船》，画面上是连结许多船只横贯江面的渡桥，构图非常优美，构思非常抒情。
    德国版画的新创作，发展极为迅速。许多作品都各有其独到之处。这两个同时举办的展览会更是集中地显示了德国版画艺术的卓越成就。祝中德两国人民牢不可破的友谊万古常青！
