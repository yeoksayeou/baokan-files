Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 29th – According to Antara News Agency's report from Cairo on the 28th, the Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, Abbas Ferhat, said when meeting with Antara News Agency reporters, "The Algerian people will continue to fight until they achieve independence."

Abbas said that the way de Gaulle seeks to solve the Algerian problem is a colonialist way. "De Gaulle wants to impose his conditions on us. He even wants us to hand over our weapons first." He said, "The Melun talks clearly proved that de Gaulle has no sincerity in resolving the Algerian problem."

He said that he believes the Algerian people's ideal of independence can be realized because the Algerian people are very strong and they have enough confidence. He pointed out that the anti-colonial and anti-imperialist front is growing stronger and stronger, and colonialism and imperialism will eventually be eliminated.

Abbas condemned the action of refusing to restore the legitimate representation in the United Nations of China, which has 650 million people. He pointed out that not admitting China into the United Nations "cannot force this country not to stand up, nor can it reduce this country's impact on the course of history."

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 27th – Ben Youssef Ben Khedda, head of the Algerian government delegation currently visiting Argentina, and deputy head Wazani met with the Speaker of the Argentine House of Representatives and introduced the Algerian people's demand for national independence. Argentine parliamentarians hosted a banquet for the delegation members.

The delegation recently held a press conference in Buenos Aires. In response to reporters' questions, Ben Khedda emphasized that without the aid of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, that is, the aid of the United States, France would not be able to continue the war in Algeria for a single day. He said, "For us (Algerians), the West represents the planes bombing our villages, the death, the injured children, the raped women, and more than two million people imprisoned in concentration camps (according to the material of the French Catholic Bishop Batten)." He emphasized the will of the Algerian people to fight for independence, saying, "Only independence can stop the war."

The Algerian government delegation was welcomed and received by the Arab diaspora communities in Argentina. The delegation also received letters from many Argentine student organizations expressing their support.

    新华社雅加达29日电　据安塔拉通讯社记者28日从开罗报道，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯·费尔哈特在接见安塔拉通讯社记者时说，“阿尔及利亚人民将继续斗争，直到获得独立为止。”
    阿巴斯说，戴高乐所要求的解决阿尔及利亚问题的方式是殖民主义的方式。“戴高乐想要把他的条件强加于人。他甚至于要我们首先交出武器。”他说，“默伦会谈清楚地证明，戴高乐没有解决阿尔及利亚问题的诚意。”
    他说，他相信阿尔及利亚人民的独立理想是能够实现的，因为阿尔及利亚人民很强大，他们有足够的信心。他指出，反殖民主义和反帝国主义战线越来越强大，殖民主义和帝国主义最后必将消灭。
    阿巴斯谴责拒绝恢复拥有六亿五千万人口的中国在联合国中的合法代表权的行动。他指出，不接纳中国入联合国，“不能迫使这个国家不站起来，也不能减少这个国家对历史进程的影响”。
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯27日电　正在阿根廷访问的阿尔及利亚政府代表团团长本·优素福·本赫达和副团长瓦札努会见了阿根廷众议院议长，并且介绍了阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的要求。阿根廷议员设宴招待了代表团人员。
    代表团最近在布宜诺斯艾利斯举行了记者招待会。本赫达在回答记者的问题时强调指出，如果没有北大西洋公约组织的援助，也就是说美国的援助，法国一天也不能在阿尔及利亚把战争继续下去。他说，“对于我们（阿尔及利亚人）来说，西方代表着轰炸我国村庄的飞机，代表死亡、被伤害的儿童、被奸污的妇女和二百多万人被关进集中营（根据法国天主教主教巴坦的材料）”。他强调表明了阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的意志，他说，“只有独立才能停止战争”。
    阿尔及利亚政府代表团受到在阿根廷的阿拉伯侨民团体的欢迎和接待。代表团还收到阿根廷许多学生组织表示支援的信件。
