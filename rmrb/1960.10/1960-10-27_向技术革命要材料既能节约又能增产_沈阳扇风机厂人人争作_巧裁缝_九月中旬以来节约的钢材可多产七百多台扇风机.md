Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th: Workers at the Shenyang Fan Factory, in the "Clever Tailor, One Serves as Many" technical performance competition, used "clever cutting" and "clever sewing" methods to conserve raw materials, achieving increased production through conservation, which powerfully guaranteed the fulfillment of the factory's increased production and conservation plan. From mid-September alone, the steel saved by the entire factory can produce over 700 additional high-quality fans.

The "Clever Tailor, One Serves as Many" technical performance competition experience was created by the riveter group of the Fifth Workshop. After the factory leadership summarized and promoted the group's experience in the increased production and conservation campaign, all factory workers immediately launched a mass technical performance competition movement of "Clever Tailor, One Serves as Many." All workers, technicians, and cadres in various trades, workshops, and departments actively participated in the competition, and the entire factory witnessed a boiling scene of everyone, everywhere, and in everything, vigorously engaging in "clever cutting" and "clever sewing" performances. Within two days, 40% of the factory's employees were named "Clever Tailors" for creating new production achievements. By the beginning of October, in the twenty-plus days since the competition began, the "Clever Tailors" emerging from various trades, workshops, and departments accounted for 70% of the factory's employees, and eleven "Clever Tailor" model groups and "Clever Tailor" work sections emerged.

Judging from the results already achieved by the Shenyang Fan Factory, the "Clever Tailor, One Serves as Many" technical performance competition is a good method for organizing the implementation of increased production and conservation plans. The workers of the Second Group of Turners in the Second Workshop, in vigorously engaging in "clever cutting" and "clever sewing" technical performances, applied five advanced experiences, reducing material consumption by one-third compared to the past while ensuring quality. The materials consumed in the past two days can now complete three days' worth of work, and the daily production level has increased by more than 20% compared to the past. Luo Youjun, a worker in the Third Workshop, adopted the "can top, don't jam" method in processing gears, and for each gear processed, he can use the saved chuck to make one more "thrust ring" component, increasing production efficiency by 30% compared to the past. Under the slogan "Everyone strives to be a clever tailor, everywhere vows to achieve one serves as many," the entire factory has saved 411 tons of various types of steel since mid-September, as well as a large amount of coke, wood, cotton yarn, welding rods, calcium carbide, and other raw materials. At the same time, the production efficiency of 60% of the factory's workers has also reached the level of one person doing the work of two to five people. In September, the factory's output increased by 22.9% compared to August, while material consumption decreased by 10.5% compared to August.

After the "Clever Tailor, One Serves as Many" technical performance competition was launched, it effectively promoted the development of technical innovation and technical revolution movements throughout the factory. In order to achieve "clever cutting" and "clever sewing" and to achieve the goal of "one serves as many," workers took the initiative to innovate operations and processes. In the twenty-plus days after the competition began, more than 1,400 technical innovations emerged throughout the factory, and 800 sets of experience were matched and incorporated into the process regulations. Currently, in this factory, workers in processing trades such as turning, boring, milling, and planing have generally promoted processing experiences such as "can nest, don't drill," "can cut, don't slice," "can top, don't jam," and "multiple knives, multiple blades"; in trades such as fitting and riveting, operation methods such as "can cold (bend), don't hot (bend)," "can press, don't hammer," "can weld, don't rivet," "can punch, don't shear," and "can grind, don't file" have been widely implemented; casting workers have also used magnesite to replace wood in the manufacture of models for 90% of the components, and the experience of "one mold, multiple castings" has been generally promoted in small castings.

The development of the "Clever Tailor, One Serves as Many" technical performance competition has also stimulated the enthusiasm and creativity of the office staff, further improving the level of enterprise management. In this movement, technical staff in various departments have generally launched competitions for clever design, clever technology, clever management, and clever business. In September alone, designers reformed eight old product designs and put forty reformed products into production. Based on the calculation of only two of the redesigned old products, the use of the direct connection method between the motor and the impeller, eliminating the gearbox and transmission parts, reduced materials and manufacturing man-hours by half, and by the end of the year, 100 tons of steel can be saved. Process personnel also went deep into the workshops and worked with the workers to test and promote the new technology of circular arc gears, which not only greatly reduced the size of the gears and saved materials, but also reduced processing man-hours by 30% to 40%. Under the organization and leadership of the factory's Party committee, many technical staff and veteran workers jointly formed a three-way combination of "Clever Tailor Identification and Promotion Teams" to perform on-the-spot identification of newly emerging "clever cutting" and "clever sewing" experiences and promptly incorporate them into the process regulations, so that advanced technical experience can be rapidly promoted, consolidated, and improved, and achieve immediate results.

### 向技术革命要材料既能节约又能增产  沈阳扇风机厂人人争作“巧裁缝”  九月中旬以来节约的钢材可多产七百多台扇风机

    向技术革命要材料既能节约又能增产
    沈阳扇风机厂人人争作“巧裁缝”
    九月中旬以来节约的钢材可多产七百多台扇风机
    据新华社沈阳26日电　沈阳扇风机厂职工在“巧裁缝、一顶多”技术表演赛中，用“巧裁”、“巧缝”的办法节约原料材料，做到从节约中求增产，使全厂实现增产节约计划得到了有力保证。仅从9月中旬以来，全厂节约下来的钢材就可以多产七百多台优质扇风机。
    “巧裁缝、一顶多”技术表演赛经验，是这个厂五车间铆工小组创造的。厂的领导在增产节约运动中，总结推广了这个小组的经验以后，全厂职工就立即展开了“巧裁缝、一顶多”的群众性技术表演竞赛运动。各工种、各车间和科室的所有工人、技术人员和干部都纷纷投入到竞赛中去，全厂出现了一个人人、处处、事事大闹“巧裁”、
  “巧缝”表演的沸腾景象，两天时间，全厂就有40％的职工由于创造了新的生产成绩而被命名为“巧裁缝”。到10月初，在竞赛开展的二十多天中，各个工种、车间、科室涌现出的“巧裁缝”已占全厂职工的70％，并且出现了十一个“巧裁缝”标兵组和“巧裁缝”工段。
    从沈阳扇风机厂已经取得的成果来看，“巧裁缝、一顶多”技术表演赛，是组织实现增产节约计划的好方法。二车间车工二组工人在大闹“巧裁”、“巧缝”技术表演中，运用了五种先进经验，在保证质量前提下，使材料消耗量比过去降低了三分之一，利用过去两天消耗的材料，现在可以完成三天的工作量，日产水平比过去提高了20％以上。三车间工人罗有君在加工齿轮中，采取“能顶不卡”的方法，每加工一个齿轮就可以利用节省下的卡头多做一个“推力环”部件，生产效率比过去提高了30％。全厂职工在“人人争当巧裁缝，处处誓达一顶多”的口号下，从9月中旬以来，已节约各种钢材达四百一十一吨，以及大量的焦炭、木材、棉纱、焊条、电石等原材料。与此同时，全厂60％的工人的生产效率也已达到一人顶两人到五人。9月份，这个厂产量比8月份增长了22.9％，而材料消耗却比8月份降低了10.5％。
    “巧裁缝、一顶多”技术表演赛展开以后，有效地促进了全厂技术革新和技术革命运动的发展。职工们为了实现“巧裁”、“巧缝”和达到一顶多的目的，人人动手革新操作，革新工艺。竞赛展开后的二十多天，全厂就出现了一千四百多项技术革新，并且配成了八百套经验，纳入工艺规程。目前，在这个工厂里，车、镗、铣、刨等加工工种的工人普遍推行了能套不钻、能切不片、能顶不卡和多刀多刃等加工经验；在钳工、铆工等工种中广泛实行了能冷（曲）不热（曲）、能压不锤、能焊不铆、能冲不剪、能磨不锉等操作方法；铸造工人也在90％的部件上采用菱苦土代替木材制造模型，在小 型铸件上普遍推行了一模多铸经验。
    开展“巧裁缝、一顶多”技术表演赛，也激发了科室人员的积极性和创造性，进一步提高了企业管理水平。各个科室的技职人员，在这一运动中都普遍开展了巧设计、巧工艺、巧管理、巧业务竞赛。设计人员在9月份一个月里就改革了八种老产品设计，并且使四十种改革后的产品投入了生产。仅据其中经过设计改革的两种老产品计算，由于采用电机与叶轮直联的方法，取消了变速箱和传动部分，就使材料和制造工时减少了一半，到年末可以节约钢材一百吨。工艺人员也深入车间和工人一起，试验推行了圆弧齿轮新技术，不仅大大缩减了齿轮的尺寸，节省了材料，而且使加工工时减少了30％到40％。在工厂党委组织领导下，很多技职人员还和老工人共同组织成三结合“巧裁缝鉴定、推广队”，对新出现的“巧裁”、“巧缝”经验，当场表演鉴定，及时纳入工艺规程，使先进技术经验得到迅速推广和巩固提高，立竿见影收到实效。
