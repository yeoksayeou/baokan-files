Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 27th -- Indonesian Party Secretary-General Asnawi Said published an article in the "Eastern Star" newspaper yesterday, warmly praising the brilliant achievements China has made in socialist construction under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. He returned after visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

Said said in the article, "A comprehensive and extensive revolution is taking place in the vast areas of China. The revolutionary movement has spread to all aspects of mass life. Large-scale socialist construction is underway throughout China. This is the case in industry, agriculture, education, culture, and the arts."

The article believes that Mao Zedong Thought, the product of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of China, "is the absolute truth that has enabled the Chinese people's revolution to achieve brilliant victory." It said, "The leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the support of the broad masses of the people have changed the face of China and enabled China to leap forward from an extremely backward state."

The article praised the people's communes in China's urban and rural areas. It said that because the communes have established public canteens and nurseries, women have been liberated from housework, and therefore the strength of Chinese women has become one of China's production factors.

The article went on to say that although the living standards of the Chinese people are not high at present, "During our stay in China, we did not see a person with idle hands, nor did we see an unemployed person holding a diploma and looking for a job everywhere. We also did not see women prostituting themselves for a living or half-naked people looking for food in garbage dumps. All of this is an irrefutable fact."

The article said, "China's leaders live a simple life. This gives the people a higher enthusiasm for labor. They believe that their labor is for all the people, not for a few to live a life of luxury. What they produce are the main things needed for construction. They do not focus on producing luxury goods first."

The article also said that China's "achievements in industry and the workers' work ethic are something we never imagined."

The article concluded by saying that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and based on the two-legged approach adopted in socialist construction, China's industrial productivity will be greatly developed.

    印度尼西亚党秘书长阿斯纳威·赛义德著文指出
    毛泽东思想是中国革命胜利的绝对真理
    新华社雅加达27日电　印度尼西亚党秘书长阿斯纳威·赛义德昨天在“东星报”上发表文章，热情赞扬中国在毛泽东思想指导下在社会主义建设中取得的辉煌成就。他是应中国人民外交学会的邀请到中国访问后归来的。
    赛义德在文章中说，“在整个中国的广大地区正在进行着全面而广泛的革命。革命运动扩展到群众生活的各个方面。中国各地正在进行大规模的社会主义建设。在工业、农业、教育、文化和艺术方面，情形都是如此。”
    文章认为，马克思列宁主义普遍真理和中国具体实践相结合的产物——毛泽东思想，“是使中国人民革命获得辉煌胜利的绝对真理”。它说，“中国共产党的领导和广大人民群众的支持使中国的面貌发生了变化，使中国从极端落后的状态向前跃进。”
    文章赞扬了中国的城乡人民公社。它说，由于公社建立了公共食堂和托儿所，妇女从家务中解放了出来，因此中国妇女的力量已经成为中国生产因素之一。
    文章接着说，虽然中国人民目前的生活水平还不高，但是“我们在中国逗留期间，没有看到一个双手闲着的人，也没有看到一个手里拿着毕业文凭到处去寻找职业的失业者。我们也没有看到为了生活而当妓女的妇女和在垃圾堆中寻找食物的半裸的人。这一切都是无可反驳的事实。”
    文章说，“中国的领导人生活朴素。这使人民具有更高的劳动热情。他们相信自己的劳动是为全体人民，而不是为少数人过奢侈生活。他们所生产的东西是建设所需的主要东西。他们不首先着重生产奢侈品。”
    文章还说，中国“在工业方面所取得的成就和工人们的劳动情绪是我们从来没有想到的。”
    文章最后说，在毛泽东思想的指导下，根据在社会主义建设中采取两条腿走路的方针，中国的工业生产力将会大大发展。
