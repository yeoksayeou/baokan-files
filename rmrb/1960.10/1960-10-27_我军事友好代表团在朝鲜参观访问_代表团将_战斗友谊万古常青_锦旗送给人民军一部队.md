Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 26th: The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation, led by Marshal He Long and General Luo Ruiqing, accompanied by Vice Premier of the Cabinet and Minister of National Defense of Korea, General Kim Kwang-hyup, visited and observed the Mangyongdae Academy near Pyongyang this morning. The delegation also visited a unit of the Korean People's Army.

The Mangyongdae Academy nurtures and educates more than 800 children of martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves in the revolutionary war and children of cadres who made contributions in the revolutionary war. Many of these students are not yet fifteen years old. When the delegation arrived at the school, these revolutionary children, growing up under the kind care and education of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, held up bouquets and cheered enthusiastically.

After the visit, Marshal He Long and General Luo Ruiqing personally presented banners, "August 1st Commemorative Medals," and other gifts to the academy. The academy also presented gifts to the delegation.

The delegation visited a unit of the Korean People's Army under the command of General Kim Dae-hong, and was warmly welcomed by the officers and soldiers lining the streets. Republic combat heroes in the unit, their chests covered with medals and awards, stood at the forefront of the welcoming crowd.

After the visit, Marshal He Long and General Luo Ruiqing personally presented this unit with a banner inscribed with "The Combat Friendship Forged in Blood Between the Armies of China and North Korea Will Last Forever," the emblem of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and "August 1st Commemorative Medals." The unit also presented gifts to the delegation.

Accompanying the delegation on the visit today were General Kim Chang-bong, Chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army, General Heo Bong-hak, Director of the General Political Bureau, and General Choe Yong-jin, Vice Minister of National Defense.

Qiao Xiaoguang, Chinese Ambassador to North Korea, and Senior Colonel Zhang Leting, Military Attaché, accompanied the delegation on the visit.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 26th: The Military Friendship Delegation of the People's Republic of China, accompanied by General Kim Chang-bong, Chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army, and others, visited the Korean Fatherland Liberation War Memorial Hall this afternoon.

After the visit, the delegation wrote the following inscription for the memorial hall: "The great achievements established by the heroic Korean people and the People's Army will shine brightly with the sun and moon forever. Long live the Korean people and the People's Army!"

The memorial hall has sixteen branches, including the Combat Hall, the Heroes Hall, and the Volunteer Army Hall. Each exhibit records the glorious victories of the Korean people in the war against American imperialist aggression.

The delegation visited the sand table model of the Taejon Campaign, in which the Korean People's Army annihilated the U.S. 24th Division in the early stages of the Korean War. In this campaign, the Korean People's Army captured alive the U.S. Major General Dean, commander of the division, and his helmet is now on display there. The delegation also visited the sand table and tunnel model of the famous Hill 1211 battle. During this fierce battle, which lasted sixty days, the U.S. military fired an average of 30,000 to 40,000 shells and bombs at this five or six-kilometer-long position held by the Korean People's Army every day, and launched up to twenty-seven assaults in a single day. However, the U.S. military failed to advance an inch here and lost 15,000 men. General Luo Ruiqing pointed to the sand table and said with a smile: The U.S. soldiers helplessly called this hill "Heartbreak Ridge." The delegation also visited a torpedo boat displayed in the memorial hall, which the Korean People's Army Navy used to sink a U.S. cruiser and several other ships in the waters of Chumonjin.

In the Volunteer Army Hall, the delegation visited the sand table models of the famous Battle of Shangganling and the Battle of Katchon, in which more than 15,000 enemies were annihilated. The members of the delegation stood for a long time in front of the statue of Volunteer Army hero Huang Jiguang. They were also interested in seeing the iron picks used by Volunteer Army soldiers to dig tunnels. One large pickaxe had been worn down to the size of a fist. The total length of the tunnels dug and repaired by the Volunteer Army on the Korean front was about 1,250 kilometers, which is equivalent to tunneling a tunnel from Beijing to Pyongyang. The tunnels dug and repaired by the Korean People's Army and the Volunteer Army on the Korean front constituted an underground Great Wall that the U.S. military could not break through.

Many exhibits in the memorial hall show the combat friendship forged in blood between the people and armies of China and North Korea. The delegation visited the oil paintings depicting the moving deeds of internationalist martyr Luo Shengjiao rescuing Korean boy Choi Young, and Volunteer Army Mama Liu Meiai caring for wounded Volunteer Army soldiers. Afterwards, everyone's eyes followed the guide's pointer to an old-fashioned watch, an ordinary watch with a moving story. This watch was given to Volunteer Army soldier Wang Chenggen by his father when he joined the Volunteer Army. His father told him that the watch was given to him by an anti-Japanese guerrilla fighter, who was operating in the area of Ning'an County, Jilin Province, the hometown of Wang Chenggen's father, as a thank you for the support given to them by the Chinese people. Later, Wang Chenggen was seriously injured on the Korean front, and the Korean people rescued him and nursed him back to health in the home of a young man named Park Chang-sik in Yangsari, Soheung County, North Hwanghae Province, where he received meticulous care from his family. When Park Chang-sik later wanted to join the People's Army, Wang Chenggen gave the watch to Park Chang-sik. After hearing this story, the comrades of the delegation were deeply moved by the traditional and profound friendship between the people of China and North Korea.

After the delegation visited the memorial hall, the person in charge of the memorial hall presented the delegation with photo albums and other gifts related to the memorial hall, and the delegation presented the memorial hall with a banner.

Accompanying the delegation on the visit to the memorial hall were: General Heo Bong-hak, Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, and General Choe Yong-jin, Vice Minister of National Defense. Senior Colonel Zhang Leting, Military Attaché of the Chinese Embassy in North Korea, also visited the memorial hall with the delegation today.

    我军事友好代表团在朝鲜参观访问
    代表团将“战斗友谊万古常青”锦旗送给人民军一部队
    新华社平壤26日电　由贺龙元帅、罗瑞卿大将率领的中国访朝军事友好代表团，在朝鲜内阁副首相兼民族保卫相金光侠大将陪同下，今天上午在平壤附近参观访问了万景台学院。代表团还访问了一支人民军部队。
    万景台学院哺育培养着朝鲜人民在革命战争中英勇牺牲的烈士的八百多名子弟，以及在革命战争中立下功劳的干部的子弟。其中不少学生还不到十五岁。当代表团到达校址时，这些在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅亲切关怀教养下成长着的革命子弟，高举花束，热烈欢呼。
    参观访问后，贺龙元帅、罗瑞卿大将亲自将锦旗、“八一纪念章”等礼品赠给了学院。学院也向代表团献了礼。
    代表团到朝鲜人民军上将金大弘属下的人民军部队参观访问，受到部队官兵们的夹道欢迎。部队内的共和国战斗英雄们胸前挂满勋章和奖章，站在欢迎队伍的最前列。
    参观访问后，贺龙元帅、罗瑞卿大将亲自将一面写着“中朝两国军队以鲜血结成的战斗友谊万古常青”的锦旗、中国人民解放军军徽和“八一纪念章”等礼品赠给了这支部队。这支部队也向代表团献了礼。
    今天陪同代表团参观访问的还有朝鲜人民军总参谋长金昌凤上将、总政治局长许凤学上将、民族保卫省副相崔勇进上将。
    中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光、武官张乐亭上校随同代表团进行了参观访问。
    新华社平壤26日电　中华人民共和国访朝军事友好代表团由朝鲜人民军总参谋长金昌凤上将等陪同，今天下午参观了朝鲜祖国解放战争纪念馆。
    代表团在参观后，为纪念馆写下了如下的题词：“英雄的朝鲜人民和人民军所建立起来的丰功伟绩将与日月同辉永放光芒，朝鲜人民和人民军万岁！”
    纪念馆共有战斗馆、英雄馆、志愿军馆等十六个分馆，其中每一件展品都纪录着朝鲜人民在反对美帝国主义侵略的战争中取得的光辉胜利。
    代表团参观了在朝鲜战争初期朝鲜人民军歼灭美军第二十四师的大田战役的沙盘模型。在这次战役中，朝鲜人民军活捉了美军少将师长迪安，他所戴的钢盔现在就摆在那里。代表团还参观了著名的一二一一高地战斗的沙盘和这个阵地上的坑道模型。在这次为时六十天的激烈战斗中，美军平均每天向这段朝鲜人民军据守的五、六公里长的阵地倾泻三、四万发炮弹和炸弹，最多时一天进行二十七次冲锋。但是，美军在这里没有能够前进一寸，白白损兵折将一万五千人。罗瑞卿大将指着这个沙盘笑着说：美军士兵就无可奈何地把这一高地叫做“伤心岭”。代表团还参观了纪念馆中陈列的一艘鱼雷艇，朝鲜人民军海军曾用这艘鱼雷艇在注文津海面上击沉了美军的巡洋舰和其他舰艇多艘。
    在志愿军馆里，代表团参观了著名的上甘岭战役和围歼敌人一万五千多人的价川战役的沙盘模型。代表团的成员们在志愿军英雄黄继光的塑像前伫立了好久，他们还有兴趣地看了志愿军战士挖修坑道用的铁镐，有一把大镐被磨得只剩下拳头大小。志愿军在朝鲜前线挖修的坑道共长约一千二百五十公里，这等于从山中凿了一条从北京到平壤这样长的隧道。朝鲜人民军和志愿军在朝鲜前线挖修的坑道，构成了一条美军攻不破的地下长城。
    纪念馆内的许多展品显示了朝中两国人民和军队间以鲜血结成的战斗友谊。代表团参观了描绘着国际主义烈士罗盛教舍身救出朝鲜少年崔?和志愿军妈妈柳梅爱护志愿军伤员的动人事迹的油画。随后，大家的目光随着解说员的指示棒转到一支老式的手表上，这只普通的手表有着一个动人的故事。这只表是志愿军战士王成根在参加志愿军时他的父亲给他的，他的父亲并告诉他，这只表是金日成抗日游击队在他们的家乡——吉林省宁安县一带活动时，一个抗日游击队员为感谢中国人民给他们的支援而送给他的。后来王成根在朝鲜前线负了重伤，朝鲜人民把他救护下来，在黄海北道瑞兴郡阳沙里朴昌植这个青年人的家中养伤，受到了他一家人的无微不至的照顾。朴昌植后来要参加人民军去，王成根就把表送给了朴昌植。代表团的同志们听了这个故事，都为中朝两国人民间的传统的深厚友谊而深深感动。
    在代表团参观纪念馆之后，纪念馆负责人向代表团赠送了有关纪念馆的照片集等礼品，代表团向纪念馆赠送了一面锦旗。
    陪同代表团参观纪念馆的还有：朝鲜人民军总政治局长许凤学上将、民族保卫省副相崔勇进上将。中国驻朝鲜大使馆武官张乐亭上校今天也同代表团参观了纪念馆。
