Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 13th: Shanghai's iron and steel workers are learning from and catching up with the city's model furnace—No. 1 blast furnace in the No. 2 Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3. This competition has achieved a large-scale harvest, and the advanced level of No. 1 furnace is becoming the universal level of iron furnaces in various steel plants. According to statistics from relevant departments, the average melting rate of large iron furnaces in the city has recently increased to 15.6 tons, of which three-quarters of the furnaces have approached or caught up with No. 1 furnace, reaching more than 18 tons. Because the iron furnaces in various plants supplied steelmaking furnaces with large quantities of high-quality molten iron, the city's steel production in September exceeded the monthly plan by 1.9%, and steel production in the first ten days of October continued to rise compared with the same period in September. A new upsurge in seizing a larger increase in steel production is taking shape.

To continue to focus on iron furnaces and supply steelmaking furnaces with large quantities of high-quality molten iron is the key to the current substantial increase in steel production in Shanghai. Since August, the Municipal Bureau of Metallurgy, the CPC Wusong District Committee, and the Party committees of various steel plants have firmly grasped the experience of No. 1 furnace in "putting politics in command at the furnace front" and vigorously organized its promotion. The "learn from, catch up with, and surpass" movement of No. 1 furnace, launched by iron furnace workers throughout the city, is unfolding in depth, persistently, and comprehensively. High-yield records have been continuously emerging in various plants and furnaces, and the city's steel production has been higher every ten days. Supply, marketing, transportation, and office departments have also fully learned and promoted the experience of No. 1 furnace. They proposed: "Heart at the furnace, body at the furnace, bring convenience to the furnace, and bring difficulties back." Steel workers throughout the city are determined to work hard in October and the fourth quarter to raise the daily output of steel to a higher level.

Earnest promotion of the experience of No. 1 furnace has created a situation in various steel plants and workshops in Shanghai where everyone is doing political and ideological work, and everyone is striving to be advanced. Backward workshops, work sections, and groups are determined to strengthen themselves and catch up quickly; advanced workshops and work sections are conscientious and forge ahead courageously. The competition is extremely heated. The iron furnace team No. 3 (formerly Team C) of the Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, which had previously lagged behind, comprehensively summarized and inspected its own production and work when promoting the experience of No. 1 furnace; various types of work and sections such as furnace tending, charging, transporting materials, and driving cranes, took the initiative in production, strengthened mutual cooperation; the workers studied assiduously, constantly explored and mastered the laws of production, and created several advanced operation methods, which made production rise rapidly. The melting rate of this team's iron furnace caught up with No. 1 furnace last month, with an average hourly melting rate of 18.67 tons for the entire month. The more fiercely the workshops throughout the city catch up, the faster No. 1 furnace of Steel Plant No. 3 runs. The eighteen partners on the furnace work together to bring production to a higher level. In a production cycle that ended in early October, their average melting rate reached 20.7 tons, continuing to lead among large iron furnaces in the city.

While learning from the experience of No. 1 furnace, the workers of various plants worked diligently and assiduously, determined to learn deeply, thoroughly, and well. They came to the front of the No. 1 blast furnace of Steel Plant No. 3 to learn advanced operating experience by following the shifts according to their jobs, and to deeply study the essence of the No. 1 furnace experience—everyone doing political and ideological work. When Cang Dingtai, a young worker from Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, went to the No. 1 furnace to study, he saw that a young furnace chief who had entered the steel plant with him in 1958 had made rapid progress in politics and technology due to putting politics in command. After returning, he immediately wrote his determination to overcome the ironmaking barrier on the furnace. Braving the high temperature, he insisted on experimenting with advanced slagging operations, and finally became the first to master this operation method, becoming a model of slagging operations. After his experience was promoted in the workshop, it quickly solved the key problem of easy accidents at the slag outlet of the iron furnace, promoting the increase in the output of the iron furnace.

    心到炉前　身到炉前　政治到炉前
    上海钢铁职工猛赶标兵炉
    全市大型化铁炉熔化率普遍提高钢产量不断上升
    据新华社上海13日电　上海钢铁战线职工学习和追赶全市标兵炉——上钢三厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉的竞赛，获得了大面积丰收，一号炉的先进水平正在成为各钢铁厂化铁炉的普遍水平。据有关部门统计，最近一个月来，全市大型化铁炉的平均熔化率已经提高到十五点六吨，其中四分之三的炉子熔化率已接近或赶上了一号炉，达到了十八吨以上。由于各厂化铁炉以量多质好的铁水供应了炼钢炉炼钢，全市9月份钢产量超额1.9％完成了月计划，10月上旬钢的产量比9月同期又继续上升。一个夺取钢产量更大幅度增长的新高潮正在形成。
    继续狠抓化铁炉，用量多质好的铁水供给炼钢炉炼钢，是当前上海钢产量大幅度增长的关键。8月份以来，市冶金局、中共吴淞区委以及各钢铁厂党委，就一直狠狠抓住一号炉“政治上炉前”的经验，大力组织推广。全市化铁炉职工掀起的“学、赶、超”一号炉运动，正在深入地、持久地全面展开。各厂、各炉座的高产纪录连续涌现，全市钢产量一旬高过一旬。供销、运输、科室等各部门也全面地学习和推广一号炉的经验。他们提出：“心到炉前，身到炉前，把方便送炉前，把困难带回来”。全市钢铁战线的职工，决心大干10月、大干四季度，将钢的日产量提到更高的水平。
    认真推广一号炉的经验，使上海各钢厂、各车间出现了人人做政治思想工作，个个力争先进的局面。后进的车间、工段、小组，发愤图强急起直追；先进的车间、工段，兢兢业业，奋勇前进。竞赛进行得极为热烈。过去落在后面的上钢一厂第二转炉车间化铁炉第三中队（原来的丙班），在推广一号炉经验时，全面总结、检查了自己的生产和工作；炉前、上料、运料、行车等各工种、各工段，在生产中环环主动，事事主动，加强了相互的协作；工人群众更刻苦钻研，不断摸索、掌握生产规律，创造出几种先进的操作方法，使生产扶摇直上。这个中队的化铁炉，上个月就赶上了一号炉，全月平均小时熔化率高达十八点六七吨。全市各车间追赶得越猛，三厂一号炉跑得也越快，炉上十八个伙伴齐心协力，使生产更上一层楼。他们在10月初结束的一个生产周期中，平均熔化率达到了二十点七吨，继续在全市大型化铁炉中领先。
    在学习一号炉经验时，各厂职工都勤学、苦学、决心学深、学透、学好。他们纷纷来到三厂一号化铁炉炉前，一面按工种对口跟班认真学习先进的操作经验，一面深入学习一号炉经验的精华——人人做政治思想工作。上钢一厂青年工人仓定泰，到一号炉前学习时，看到一个1958年同他一起进钢铁厂的青年炉长，由于政治挂帅，政治上、技术上都进步很快，回来以后，他立即把自己攻破化铁关的决心写在炉子上。他冒着高温坚持试验先进的流渣操作，终于第一个掌握了这项操作法，成为流渣操作的标兵。他的经验在车间推广后，很快解决了化铁炉出渣口易出事故的关键，促进了化铁炉产量的上升。
