    Not a Grain Lost
    He Wanxiang, only a month ago a worker in a cotton blanket factory, is now a very skilled commune member working in the fields.
    On her second day at the production team, it happened to be the autumn harvest. As she worked, she wondered: How can I, at the forefront of agricultural production, contribute the most to greatly developing agriculture and grain production? She thought: We must harvest carefully and meticulously during the autumn harvest, and that is practical action. With this in mind, she worked with great energy and meticulous care, not letting a single grain or a single blade of grass be wasted. Once, while she was picking millet ears with other commune members, she saw that some people were not picking carefully enough and were missing some ears. She picked them up and said, "Every grain of food is earned with everyone's sweat; we can't just throw it away!" He Wanxiang's exemplary actions set an example for the commune members, and everyone respects her.

    颗粒不丢
    何万香，一个月以前还是棉毯厂工人，现在已经是干庄稼活很熟练的公社社员了。
    她来到生产队的第二天，正赶上秋收，她一边干活一边想：到了农业生产第一线应该怎样为大办农业、大办粮食贡献最大的力量呢？她想：秋收时一定要精收细打，这就是实际行动。这样她生产时干劲大心又细，哪怕一粒粮、一棵草都不让抛撒。有一次，她同社员们一起掐谷穗，看见有人掐的不细致，有漏掐的穗，她就一边拣一边说：“每一穗粮食都是大家的汗水换来的，可不能白白丢掉啊！”何万香的模范行动，给社员们树立了榜样，大家都很尊敬她。
