    Bugler
    —To the Buglers of the Commune and Wishing a Happy 11th Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation
    Tian JianEvery time at dawn, the bugler sounds the bugle, he cheers for the mountains and forests, and the mountains and forests are inspired by him. He is like a morning star, rising with the rosy clouds, he grew up in the flames of war, with a red heart in his bosom.
  (As wide as the sea,
    As firm as the mountain.)On this high mountain rock, there will always be a bugler, always a Communist Party member, sending out bursts of bugle calls. The Golden Ox has already danced, and will never lie down again (Note 1), carrying the glorious mission on its huge iron back. The commune is light, and the leaping people are spring. Listen, the bugle call resounds through the sky, look, the swallows fly high into the clouds (Note 2) Carrying an axe to split the sky, holding the sun for the Long March!
    (Note 1) Legend has it that there is a golden ox lying in the Chuanxia Basin outside the Great Wall. Since the Great Leap Forward, people have said that the golden ox has stood up.
    (Note 2) The revolutionary deeds of Xing Yanzi are spreading everywhere.

    吹号人
    ——致公社的号手并祝建国十一周年
    田间每当黎明的时刻，号手吹响了号声，他为山林来欢呼，山林为他所振奋。他像一颗启明星，和朝霞一同上升，他在战火里长大，怀里有一颗红心。
  （像海一样宽广，
    像山一样坚定。）在这高高的山岩上，永远有个吹号人，永远有共产党员，传来一阵阵号声。金牛已经起舞了，再也不会卧倒，（注一）正以巨大的铁背，背负光荣的使命。公社就是光明，跃进的人就是春。听，号声响彻天空，看，燕子高飞入云（注二）身背一把开天斧，手托太阳去长征！
    （注一）传说在长城外川下盆地，有一条金牛在躺着，大跃进以来，人们又说，金牛站起来了。
    （注二）邢燕子的革命事迹，正在到处流传着。
