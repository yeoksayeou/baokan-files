    The Battle to Rescue Lives
    Li Xun
    On the night of August 3rd, a torrential rain poured down on the city of Benxi. The rain lashed the ground, creating a cloud of white mist, converging into countless rivers that cascaded downward, merging into even larger, more rapid torrents, surging towards the river.
    The water level of the Taizi River rose sharply. One meter, two meters... the floodwaters steadily devoured the elevation markings on the water level gauge, approaching the maximum warning line, exceeding the maximum warning line....
    A "Houhu River," flowing from the northern suburbs into the city, carried a massive mountain flood, meeting the flood peak of the Taizi River. The collision of the two peaks produced a deafening roar. Many streets in the city were flooded, and Dabu Street, near the riverbank, was surrounded by floodwaters.
    "The entire Party and all the people must mobilize urgently and fight the flood!" The Benxi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call to battle. Kong Weizhong, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, issued an urgent order to all public security officers, based on the instructions of the Municipal Committee: Mobilize immediately.
    A red fire truck sped towards Dabu Street, navigating the waves. The car struggled forward, the floodwaters submerging the wheels, covering the foot pedals, the vehicle jerking and sputtering, the engine dying.
    Secretary Zhao of the District Committee and District Head Li were the first to jump out of the car: "Comrades, get out of the car, advance on foot." A young man of twenty-seven or eight stepped forward and loudly requested: "District Head Li, let me go to the western end of Dabu Street!"
    The western end, the western end was the lowest-lying area of Dabu Street, and also the area with the most severe flooding. District Head Li knew that this was Comrade Chen Chungui, a Communist Party member and Deputy Chief of the Public Security Section of the District Public Security Bureau. He was familiar with Chen Chungui's voice and everything about Chen Chungui: like all children from poor peasant backgrounds, Chen Chungui's childhood had been spent in blood, tears, and hardship. After liberation, he joined the revolution and, nurtured by the Party, diligently progressed, becoming an outstanding state cadre. Since the Great Leap Forward, he had been honored as a district red banner bearer and an advanced worker in the municipal public security system for two consecutive years.
    "Can you swim?"
    "Yes!" Chen Chungui lied to his leader for the first time. His request was immediately approved.
    The western end of Dabu Street was a torrent of water. The river surged into the residential area from three sides, tightly surrounding the residential area of over a hundred households. Chen Chungui ran desperately, and the closer he got to his destination, the more critical the situation seemed. He had no time to choose a path, he plunged into the heart of the street, fighting against the strong "tributary." The water got deeper and deeper, the waves blocked by his body surging up and striking his chest. The sound of water, the sound of rain, and the faintly heard cries for help were intertwined. "Life!" Something flashing crossed his mind, "The lives of our class brothers!" He quickened his pace. The cries for help were getting closer, emanating from a high ground.
    The high ground was full of elderly people, women, and children. Because most of the able-bodied men in this area were working night shifts, the local police and commune cadres had moved them here when the flood was imminent. But they still had family members at home, so they shouted loudly, hoping that people would go and rescue them. As soon as Chen Chungui appeared, he was surrounded by people: "Uncle, save my grandfather!" "Comrade, save my father-in-law!" "Save my mother!" Before him were countless expectant eyes, and behind him were the rolling floodwaters. What to do? He immediately rushed towards the flood in the direction pointed out by those seeking help.
    In the residential area, the floodwaters collided and squeezed between the intricate walls. Chen Chungui fought in the chest-deep water. As he approached the house, his heart tightened. This was a house with a very low foundation, the floodwaters had submerged more than half of the house, and the tightly closed doors and windows were creaking ominously under the impact of the huge waves. Chen Chungui used all his strength to smash open the window, and the floodwaters behind him rushed in, simultaneously pushing him to the ground.
    "Grandpa Zhao! Grandpa Zhao!" He choked back some water with difficulty, got up and shouted. A pair of arms landed on his shoulders.
    He carried the old man on his back, used all his strength to push away the floodwaters pouring in from the window, and jumped out of the window. Chen Chungui rescued four elderly people in one, two, three bursts of energy. However, the most intense battle for life had only just begun.
    "Save people!" Across the rolling waves, from the depths of the residential area came the simultaneous cries for help from several women, interspersed with countless children's wails. Chen Chungui shuddered: "What's going on?" It turned out that the Guo family lived in the center of this residential area. During the evacuation, the housewife, trusting the high steps of her house, stayed behind with her four children. Some women with more children nearby also left the children they could not take with them temporarily, leaving three mothers and twelve children in the house. "My child!" Several women on the high ground burst into tears, calling out their children's nicknames and rushing towards the flood. "Don't move, I'll go!" Chen Chungui stretched out his arms to stop them. "No, no one can go!" An old man hurriedly stopped Chen Chungui, saying, "My granddaughter is there too, but look, how big the water is!"
    The rain had stopped at some point, but the water continued to rise. The cries for help could be heard faintly. Chen Chungui stared angrily at the rampaging flood, and a strong will to fight to the death swelled through every cell of his body. He charged into the flood again, plunging towards the Guo family. The flood swirled into the room, the Guo family's residence was in danger. The three women stood on the kang (a heated brick bed), water up to their waists.
    They held each other's arms, holding some of the children out of the water; the other larger children sat on the kang cabinet, their feet dangling in the water. The kang was in danger of collapsing at any moment.
    Chen Chungui appeared at the window. The children scrambled to climb onto his shoulders, but were pulled back down by the women, who handed him two other children. "What!" Chen Chungui blurted out his confusion.
    "Comrade, please don't misunderstand," one woman said frankly, "We just pulled down our own children."
    Chen Chungui's heart warmed. The children's desperate desire to escape and the mothers' noble behavior shocked his whole being. "Chen Chungui, ah, Chen Chungui," he suddenly called out his own name in his mind, "What kind of era do you live in?! What kind of people are these?!" He cast a contemptuous glance at the ocean before him, he thought, "Floodwater! The worst flood in two hundred years! But we have a system and a people that have not existed for thousands of years..." He felt an increase in infinite confidence and strength, carrying two children and walking firmly towards the high ground.
    Two more children were added to the high ground, then two more.... The flood continued to rise. Chen Chungui fought more and more bravely. He cleverly engaged in "street fighting" with the flood, using the ruins and walls to flexibly avoid the flood's onslaught. It was already the sixth time he had returned to the Guo residence. Half of the corner of the wall that had been broken through by the flood had collapsed. The water had submerged the women's chests, their hands held high, raising the children above their heads. Their hands were trembling weakly. Chen Chungui took the eleventh child, he wanted to reach out and take the last one, but was pushed away by the woman.
    "Ah? You don't trust me!"
    "No, this child is too small, holding him while wading will delay you, you are more important than him." Chen Chungui was silent for a moment. In the darkness of the night, none of them could see the tears glistening in the other's eyes. "Big sister, I will resolutely complete the task!" Chen Chungui stood before the woman like a soldier requesting a mission. Helplessly, she handed over the child.
    At this moment, the torrent on the road broke through several walls along the street and rolled towards the residential area, blocking Chen Chungui's return route. He frowned, raised the baby high, and detoured upstream of the breach. In order to choose stable water, he had to risk even greater danger by traversing the corridors of one dilapidated room after another. Suddenly, a flash of white light flashed across the sky, illuminating everything in a snow-white glow - the high-voltage line above the Heng River caught fire. In an instant, the white light disappeared, and the lights in the distance also disappeared, the world was plunged into darkness. Chen Chungui thought of the baby overhead, and dared not venture forward in the unfamiliar waterways. "Erbao!" Every time he carried a child on his back, he would ask for the child's name so that he could communicate on the road. Now he called to the boy on his back: "Open your eyes and see, where are we?!"
    "This is the backyard of Old Zhang's house, an ash pit." "An ash pit!" His head buzzed. "Is it very deep?"
    "Not up to my shoulders."
    Chen Chungui wanted to retreat and find another way out. With a "crash," the room he had just passed collapsed.
    Now he could only move forward. He let "Erbao" ride on his shoulders, held his breath, raised the four-month-old baby he had just rescued, and with a determined heart, stepped into the deep water that had submerged the top.
    After crossing the dangerous situation, he hurriedly checked the baby with a nervous heart, the baby's lower body was soaked in water, but he was still soundly asleep. At this moment, Chen Chungui suddenly heard someone calling his name. "Ah? Secretary Zhao!" His heart lit up, and he raised the child and walked towards the sound. "Good fellow, so glad we found you!" Secretary Zhao and District Head Li shouted at the same time, with infinite surprise. He handed the child to the secretary and district head respectively, turned around and walked back, eager to rescue the three women in the water.
    "Don't go, look!" The secretary stopped him, pointing to the figures flickering on the raft in the dawn.
    All the residents of Dabu Street had escaped danger. The sun emerged from the clouds in a hazy outline, illuminating this heroic city that had declared war on the flood, illuminating Chen Chungui's tired but happy smiling face.

    抢救生命的战斗
    李逊
    8月3日夜，本溪市区大雨如注。雨柱打在地上卷起一阵白烟，汇成无数道河流，向低处倾泻，在低处汇成更大更急湍的波涛，涌向河身。
    太子河水位猛涨。一米、两米……洪水节节吞噬着水位标高的刻度，接近最高警戒线，超过最高警戒线……。
    一条从北郊流进市区的“后湖河”，拥着巨大的山洪，与太子河的洪峰相会。两峰相撞，发出裂石般的巨响。全市很多街道进水了，靠近河岸的大卜街被洪水包围了。
    “全党全民紧急动员起来，与洪水搏斗！”中共本溪市委发出战斗号召。市公安局孔为中局长根据市委的指示向全市公安干警发出紧急命令：立即出动。
    一辆红色消防车，向大卜街凌波驶来。汽车越走越吃力，洪水淹没了车轮，淹没了脚踏板，车身挣扎着跳动两下，灭火了。
    区委赵书记和李区长首先跳下车：“同志们下车，跑步前进。”一个二十七、八岁的年青人，抢前一步，大声请求道：“李区长，让我到大卜街西头去！”
    西头，西头是大卜街最洼的地方，也是洪水最大的地方。李区长知道，这是共产党员、区公安分局治安科副科长陈春贵同志。他熟悉陈春贵的声音，也熟悉陈春贵的一切：像所有贫农出身的孩子一样，陈春贵的童年是在血泪和辛酸中度过的。解放后，他参加了革命，在党的培育下，孜孜上进，成为一个优秀的国家干部。大跃进以来，又连续两年获得区红旗手和市公安系统先进工作者的光荣称号。
    “你会水吗？”
    “会！”陈春贵第一次在领导面前说了谎话。他的请求立即得到了批准。
    大卜街西头水势汹涌。河水从三面向居民区涌来，紧紧包围了这百余户的居民点。陈春贵拼命地奔跑，越是接近目的地，越感到情况危急。他来不及选择路径，顶着那股强劲的“支流”，奋力向街心扑去。水，越走越深，被身体抵住的浪头窜起来，冲击着胸脯。水声、雨声、隐隐传来的呼救声，交织在一起。“生命！”一个闪光的东西从心头掠过，“阶级弟兄的生命！”他加快了速度。呼救的声音临近了，发自一块高地上。
    高地上全是些老人、妇女和儿童。因为这个地区的壮年男人大部分上了夜班，在洪水将临的时候，当地民警和公社干部把他们转移到这里。但是他们家中还有人，所以他们大声呼喊，希望人们去抢救。陈春贵一出现，便被人们包围了：“叔叔，救我爷爷！”“同志，救我公公！”“救我母亲！”眼前是无数双期待的目光，背后是波涛滚滚的洪水。怎么办呢？他立刻按照求救者指出的方向，向洪水猛扑过去。
    住宅区里，洪水在错综的墙壁间冲撞着、拥挤着。陈春贵在齐胸的深水里搏斗着。当他接近那间住宅，他的心缩紧了。这是一座地基很低的房子，洪水吞没了一大半房身，紧闭着的门窗，在巨浪的冲击中发出不祥的吱吱响动。陈春贵用全身力量撞开窗户，背后的洪水抢先而入，同时把他压倒在地上。
    “赵大爷！赵大爷！”他艰难地呛了一口水，爬起来叫道。一双手臂搭上他的肩膀。
    他背起老人，用平生力气冲开从窗户涌进来的洪水，跳出窗外。陈春贵一次、两次、三次，一股劲救出四名老人。然而抢夺生命的最激烈的战斗才刚刚开始。
    “救人哪！”越过滚滚的波涛，从住宅区的深处传来几个妇女同时呼救的声音，里边夹杂着无数孩子的号哭。陈春贵打个寒颤：“这是怎么回事？”原来在这个住宅区的中心住着郭家。转移的时候，主妇信任自己房子的高台阶，同四个孩子一起留下来。邻近有些孩子较多的妇女，也把一时带不了的孩子寄在这里，房子里留下了三个母亲和十二个孩子。“我的孩子啊！”高地上几个妇女哇地一下哭出声来，一面叫着自己孩子的乳名，一面向洪水扑去。“不要动，我去！”陈春贵伸开胳臂，拦住了她们。“不行，谁也去不得！”一个老人急忙拦住陈春贵说：“那里也有我的孙女，可是你看，水多大啦！”
    雨，不知什么时候停了，可是水，还不断上涨。呼救的声音隐隐可闻。陈春贵愤怒地凝视着逞强的洪水，一种强烈的奋死决战的意志胀痛了全身的细胞。他重新冲开了洪水的阵脚，扑向郭家。洪水打着漩涡冲进室内，郭家住宅在危难中。三个妇女站在炕上，水漫腰间。
    她们互相牵挽着手臂，把一部分孩子架出水面；另一部分较大一些的孩子坐在炕柜上，脚垂在水里。炕，随时都有坍塌的危险。
    陈春贵在窗前出现了。孩子们争夺着爬上他的肩头，但又都被妇女们拉了下去，把另外两个孩子递给他。“怎么！”陈春贵脱口吐出了疑惑的心情。
    “同志，请不要误会，”一个妇女坦然地说：“方才拉下来的是我们自己的孩子。”
    陈春贵心里热乎乎的。孩子们争夺肩头时那种逃生的渴望和母亲们高尚的行为使他整个身心震撼了。“陈春贵呀，陈春贵”，他忽然暗叫起自己的名字，“你生活在什么样的时代？！这是些什么样的人民哪？！”他向眼前的一片汪洋投过轻蔑的一瞥，他心想“洪——水！二百年来所没有的洪水！可是我们有几千年来所没有的制度和人民，……”他感到增加了无限的信心和力量，扛起两个孩子向高地坚定地走去。
    高地上增加了两个孩子，又两个孩子……。洪水继续上涨。陈春贵越战越猛。他巧妙地同洪水展开了“巷战”，利用残垣断壁，灵活地躲避着洪水的锋芒。他已经是第六次返回郭宅了。被洪水冲破的墙角塌落了半边。水吞没了妇女们的胸部，她们两手抬得高高的，把孩子举到头上。手已经无力地发抖了。陈春贵接过来第十一个孩子，他想伸手去接最后一个，但却被妇女推开了。
    “啊？你不信任我！”
    “不，这孩子太小，举着他涉水会耽误你，你比他更重要。”陈春贵沉默了片刻。在这样的黑夜里，他们谁也看不清对方眼里闪着晶莹的泪水。“大嫂，我坚决完成任务！”陈春贵像请求任务的战士那样挺立在妇女的面前。她无可奈何地递过了孩子。
    这时，马路上的急流冲开了几堵临街的屋墙，向住宅区卷过来，拦住了陈春贵的归路。他拧了一下眉头，高高地举起婴儿，向决堤处的上游绕去。为了挑选稳水，他必须冒着更大的危险穿越一座座摇摇欲坠的房间的过道。忽然，天空闪起一道白光，照得通天雪亮——横河上空的高压线着火了。霎时，白光消逝了，远近的灯光也一起消逝了，天地一片漆黑。陈春贵想到顶上的婴儿，不敢在生疏的水路里冒昧前进。“二宝！”他每次背起孩子出发时，都要问清孩子的名字，以便路上联系。现在他叫着背上的男孩：“你睁眼看看，咱们在什么地方？！”
    “这是老张家后院，一个炉灰坑。”“炉灰坑！”他脑袋嗡地一声。“很深吗？”
    “没我的肩膀。”
    陈春贵想退回来另寻出路。背后“哗啦”一声响，刚刚走过的房间塌下去了。
    现在只能前进。他让“二宝”骑上他的肩头，憋住一口气，双手把才出世四个月的婴儿竖举起来，一狠心，走进了复顶的深水里。
    渡过险境，他怀着一颗紧张的心，急忙检查婴儿，婴儿的下身浸水了，但仍安然地在酣睡着。这时，陈春贵忽然听到有人喊自己的名字。“啊？赵书记！”他心里一亮，举起孩子向声音走去。“好家伙，可把你找到了！”赵书记和李区长同时喊出，带着无限惊喜。他把孩子分别塞给书记和区长，转身又往回走，急着去救水里的三名妇女。
    “不要去了，你看！”书记拦住他，指着黎明中木排上闪动着的人影。
    大卜街的居民全部脱险了。太阳从云雾中露出茫茫的轮廓，照着这座向洪水宣战的英雄城市，照着陈春贵那疲乏的，但是幸福的笑脸。
