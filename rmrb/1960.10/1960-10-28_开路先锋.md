    Trailblazer
    Our correspondent in Shaanxi

    The Lian (huasi) Meng (yuan) section of the Longnan Railway from Xi'an to Tongguan reached the capacity of a main line in just two or three months after its completion. The trains running back and forth bear the heavy transportation task, day and night, transporting construction equipment from the Central Plains and coastal areas, and crude oil, grain, and cotton from the Northwest and Southwest. Usually, a new railway line takes a year and a half to gradually take on normal transportation tasks, and the locomotives that initially arrive on the new line can only gradually become familiar with it; not to mention traveling through the perilous line of "Tongguan Road between mountains and rivers"? But now, the dangerous road has become a thoroughfare. Who is the trailblazer? It is the advanced collective on the national transportation front, the model team of the Xi'an Railway Bureau—the 631 locomotive crew.
    The original Xi (an) Tong (guan) main line, which stretched across the Weihe Plain, was relocated to the foot of Mount Hua in late June to make way for the Sanmenxia Reservoir. The Xi'an Locomotive Depot immediately faced the problem of how to ensure safe and punctual driving on the new line. This line, from Lianhuasi Station to Mengyuan Station near Tongguan, continuously climbs upwards with a steep, winding path of thirty-six kilometers. At that time, several freight trains, after leaving Lianhuasi Station, were forced to stop en route after climbing only a few kilometers or even a few hundred meters, disrupting the normal operation order. Some trains, after "stopping on the slope," failed to climb up several times and returned to Lianhuasi Station. Preventing "slope stop" accidents became a major key issue for the East Line Freight Locomotive Team of the Xi'an Locomotive Depot at that time. The continuous rain in early July further increased the difficulty of climbing the slope.
    At this time, the 631 locomotive had just been transferred from the old Tongguan Locomotive Depot. Seeing the heavy transportation tasks in front of them, they were as anxious as everyone else. Everyone deeply felt that it was their responsibility to break through this situation. Li Shijun, the Party group leader and driver, and Zhang Zhongxiao, the chief driver, and Hou Fuhai, the driver, discussed it, and everyone agreed that roads are made by people, there are no insurmountable difficulties, and if we dare to think and dare to act, we will definitely be able to blaze a trail of more loading and faster running. However, some people said to them: "Don't take risks. You have run safely for more than 400,000 kilometers and passed nearly 2,000 stations on time, which is not easy. Even a small accident like a slope stop would mean starting again from kilometer one!" Li Shijun's answer was: "We cherish the honor given to us by the people and the Party, but that is not our way to maintain honor. To cherish honor, we must charge forward for the interests of the people. If we shrink back in the face of difficulties, even if we drive safely for a million kilometers, it is not an honor, but a disgrace." Although they had only been drivers for four years and were not considered veterans, and had never run on such a slope before and were not very confident, they, with a sense of responsibility to the Party and the country, requested the leadership to give them the task of exceeding the axle load, with chief driver Zhang Zhongxiao taking the lead.
    The leaders of the East Station Turnaround Section of the Xi'an Locomotive Depot and many drivers enthusiastically supported them. The Party branch secretary encouraged them, saying: "It doesn't matter if you are not sure, you will be sure after running a few trips. Isn't the task you requested to create experience!" The old driver Zhang Hongqian patted Zhang Zhongxiao on the shoulder and introduced him to the situation of this slope and his own experience. The duty room immediately contacted the Xi'an Railway Bureau's locomotive dispatch and the Xi'an West marshalling station, and a train with a load of 2,100 tons was arranged, which was 300 tons more than the traction quota of 1,800 tons on the new line at that time.
    Just the day before, the 906 locomotive had a slope stop accident with 1,600 tons. Today, the 631 locomotive is pulling so much, and it is also a rainy day. Can it climb the dangerous slope?
    The 631 locomotive entered Lianhuasi Station, which is the first station facing the climb. Zhang Zhongxiao carefully checked every rotating part and every screw of the locomotive, and the co-driver Zhou Jianzhong filled every oil hole, and the fire layer burned thick and strong. But as soon as it left the station, this locomotive, which had gone through thousands of battles, was not listening. The initial speed did not reach the expected 30 kilometers per hour. Only three or four hundred meters away from the station, the smooth track surface showed such a great resistance, and the locomotive head suddenly trembled, followed by a slip. He quickly applied sand, but it didn't work. Then came another slip. Zhang Zhongxiao leaned out of the observation window and saw that there was no white powder line on the rail surface as usually seen when sand was applied. He suddenly realized that it was because the curve was too sharp and the sand pipe was only a few tens of millimeters in front of the wheel, and the sand was sprinkled next to the track. The fireman Chen Qijia keenly understood the chief driver's meaning, picked up a tea cup, filled it with sand, and climbed to the front of the locomotive's obstacle clearer, and sprinkled sand on the rail surface by hand. The slip stopped immediately. But after a few slips, the speed suddenly dropped to only 15 kilometers per hour.
    At this time, Zhang Zhongxiao had a fierce ideological struggle. From here to the Xinliuzhi Station in front, there are two big curves and four small curves, and the slope is steeper and the road is more difficult. The 906 locomotive stopped at the third curve. Can he climb up with this speed now? However, the encouragement of the branch secretary when he said goodbye to him, the expectant eyes of his comrades when he got on the train, and especially the 2,100 tons of goods that were heavily dragging him down, all required him to move forward bravely. He made up his mind: "Even inch by inch, I will pull it up!" His hand tightened the steam valve handle, his eyes fixed on the road, and his whole body was feeling every movement of the locomotive. Although his locomotive was moving slowly, it was moving steadily. After turning two more curves, although the resistance of the curve caused the speed to continue to drop to eight kilometers, he finally persisted to Xinliuzhi Station. At this time, he used the hundreds of meters of flat road in the station to increase the speed to more than 30 kilometers per hour, and smoothly ran through another 29 kilometers of dangerous slopes along the waist of Mount Hua, and arrived at the terminal station—Mengyuan on time.
    The comrades at Mengyuan Station welcomed the 631 locomotive with gongs and drums, and congratulated the 631 locomotive, but Zhang Zhongxiao and his companions felt that they had not completed the task. "What kind of trailblazing is this? Although there was no slope stop accident, there was a slope stop crisis, and we barely made it through. Are we just providing everyone with such an experience on the edge of an accident?"
    Heroic drivers are not only brave in practice, but also good at thinking, according to the laws of things, to find the way forward. Zhang Zhongxiao, Li Shijun, and Hou Fuhai carefully analyzed this driving. They first affirmed that even if the road was slippery on rainy days, this slope was not impossible to climb, and the reason was that they did not reach the required speed when they started climbing the slope. Why couldn't they accelerate? Because they started climbing the slope as soon as they left the station, and there was no time to accelerate, but the station was always relatively flat, so if they stopped a little further back, wouldn't there be room for acceleration! Zhang Zhongxiao couldn't help but pat his head and said: "Some locomotives can climb up, and some locomotives stop on the hillside. This must be related to the parking position." After inquiring, it turned out that it was easier to climb the slope if the parking was further back and the train did not stop at Lianhuasi Station, and it was difficult to climb up if the parking was further forward. As for the wheel slip, it was obviously due to the sharp curve and great resistance, and the wheel speed exceeded the friction between the wheel and the track. Everyone agreed that, in this case, Zhang Zhongxiao's measures to apply sand and not forcibly accelerate to increase friction and traction were correct. The problem was that the curve was too sharp, and the sand from the sand pipe could not be sprinkled on the rail surface. As long as the 40 mm diameter sand pipe was flattened to 60 mm, the problem of increasing the sand application area would be solved. Then, they summarized three other aspects of experience.
    Based on these experiences, and after several more trips, they arrived safely and punctually at the terminal station. The driving speed between Lianhuasi and Xinliuzhi stations has been increased from the original average of 20 kilometers per hour to 30 kilometers per hour. Hou Fuhai also set a record of pulling 2,350 tons, exceeding the traction quota of the old line. It is fully confirmed that they have indeed mastered the characteristics of this new line. Now, their experience has been set as the climbing measures for the entire section. At the same time, the uplink traction quota has been increased from 1,800 tons to 2,000 tons. Since the entire station's freight locomotive second team implemented this measure, there have been no slope stop accidents or delays for more than 40 days.

    开路先锋
    本报驻陕西记者
    陇南铁路由西安到潼关的莲（花寺）孟（原）段新线，在建成后仅两三个月的时间，就达到了干线通过能力的水平，担负起繁重的运输任务，往返奔驰着的列车，日夜吞吐着来自中原、沿海的建设器材和西北、西南的原油、粮、棉。通常，一条新铁路线，要经过一年半载，才能逐渐正常地担负运输任务，初到新线上的机车也才能和它混熟；何况是穿行在“山河表里潼关路”上的天险一线呢？但是如今，险路已经变为通途。谁是开路先锋呢？是全国交通战线上的先进集体、西安铁路局的标兵——631机车包乘组。
    原来伸展在渭河平川上的西（安）潼（关）干线，于6月下旬为三门峡水库让路，移到华山脚下去安家之后，在西安机务段当即发生了一个在新线上如何确保安全正点行车的问题。这条线路自莲花寺站到潼关跟前的孟原站，连续三十六公里陡弯盘旋直上。当时，接连有几次货运列车，出莲花寺站，爬不上几公里甚至几百米，就被迫停在途中，打乱了正常的运行秩序。有的在“坡停”之后连闯几次上不去，又退回了莲花寺站。防止发生“坡停”事故成了当时西安机务段东线货运机车队的重大关键。7月初的连阴雨，更增加了爬坡的困难。
    这时，631机车刚从旧潼关机务段调来。他们看到摆在面前的繁重的运输任务，和大家一样焦心。每个人都深深感到打开这个局面是他们的责任。党小组长、司机李世俊和司机长张忠孝、司机侯福海等几个党员一商量，大家一致认为，路是人走出来的，没有克服不了的困难，敢想敢干，就一定能冲出一条多拉快跑的路。可是，有人对他们说：“不敢冒险，你们安全运行了四十多万公里，正点通过了近二千个车站，可不容易，那怕来个坡停这样的小事故，就得再开始从一公里算起啊！”李世俊的回答是：“我们爱护人民和党给我们的荣誉，但那不是我们保持荣誉的方法，爱护荣誉要为人民的利益冲锋陷阵，要是在困难面前畏缩退让，即使安全行驶一百万公里，那也不是荣誉，而是耻辱。”尽管他们担任司机不过四年，算不上老手，以前又没有跑过这样的坡道，把握不大，但是，有着对党、对国家的责任感，他们请求领导上交给他们超轴牵引的任务，由司机长张忠孝跑头一趟。
    西安机务段东站折返段的领导人以及许多司机热情地支持他们，党支部书记鼓励他们说：“没有把握，不要紧，跑上几趟就有把握了，你们要求的任务不就是创造经验吗！”老司机张宏乾拍着张忠孝的肩膀向他介绍这段坡道的情况和自己的经验。值班室马上向西安铁路局机务调度和编组站西安西站联系，一列载重二千一百吨的列车挂出来了，这比当时新线的牵引定吨一千八百吨还多三百吨。
    就在前一天，906机车拉一千六百吨还发生了坡停事故。今天，631机车拉了这么多，又赶上阴雨天，能不能爬上险坡呢？
    631机车开进莲花寺车站了，这是面临爬坡的第一站。张忠孝仔细地检查机车的每一个转动部分，每一个螺丝，副司机周建中注满了每一个油眼，火层烧得又厚又旺。可是一出站，这台经过千征百战的机车居然不听使唤了。初速达不到预想的每小时三十公里的速度，离站不过三、四百米，表面光滑的跑道竟然发出如此大的阻力，车头猛地颤抖起来，紧跟着就是一个空转转。他赶紧下沙，但不顶事。紧接着又是一个空转。张忠孝从了望窗探身一望，轨面上并没有往常撒沙所见到的白粉线，他猛然想到，是因为路弯太急，车轮前只有几十毫米的砂管，把砂撒在轨道旁边了。司炉陈齐家机警地领会了司机长的意思，拿起茶缸装上沙子，就爬到车头最前面的排障器上，用手往轨面撒砂子。空转马上停止了。可是经过几个空转之后，车速骤然下降到了每小时不过十五公里的速度。
    这时，张忠孝思想斗争很激烈。从这里到达前面的新柳枝车站，还有两个大弯和四个小弯，坡度更大，路更难走，906机车就是在第三个弯上停下的，他现在刚转过第一个弯，就凭这点车速能爬上去吗？可是支部书记和他握别时的鼓励，送他上车时同志们期望的眼光，特别是正在重重地拖住他的那二千一百吨货物、都要求他勇往直前。他下定了决心：“一寸一寸地也要把它拉上去！”他的手更加握紧了汽门把，双目注视着道路，全身都在体察着机车的每一点动静。他的机车虽然是缓慢地、但却是稳稳地在前进着，又转过两个弯以后，虽然由于弯道的阻力使车速继续下降到了八公里，但他终于坚持到了新柳枝站。这时，他利用站内几百米的平道，抢起了三十公里以上的时速，擦着华山山腰，顺利地跑过了又二十九公里的险坡，正点到达了终点站——孟原。
    孟原车站的同志敲锣打鼓地欢迎631机车，庆贺631机车，可是张忠孝和他的同伴们却觉得没有完成任务。“这算什么开路呢，虽然没有造成坡停事故，可是已经发生了坡停危机，只是勉强过来的。难道就为大家提供这样一个事故边缘上的经验吗？”
    英雄的司机不仅勇于实践，而且善于思索，根据事物的规律，找出前进的道路。张忠孝和李世俊、侯福海认真地分析了这次行车。他们首先肯定，即便是雨天道滑，这个坡也并不是无法爬上去的，原因是他们开始爬坡就没有达到所需要的速度。为什么没有能够加速呢？是因为出站就上坡，加速来不及，可是站内总是比较平坦的，假若靠后一些停车，不就有抢速的余地了吗！张忠孝不由地拍打起自己的脑袋，说：“有些机车能够爬上去，有的机车停在半坡，这一定与停车位置有关。”一打听，果然是停车靠后和在莲花寺站不停车的爬坡就容易，停车靠前的爬起来就难。至于车轮空转，很显然是由于弯急阻力大，轮子转速超过了车轮与轨道之间的摩擦力。大家一致认为，在这种情况下，张忠孝采取撒沙和不强行加速的措施以增大摩擦和牵引力是对的，问题是转弯急，沙管下沙撒不到轨面上，只要把直径四十毫米的沙管砸扁成六十毫米，加大撒沙面积问题就解决了。接着，他们又总结出了其他方面的三条经验。
    他们根据这些经验，又经过几次行车，都安全正点地到达了终点站。莲花寺、新柳枝两站之间的行车速度，已由原来的平均每小时二十公里，提高到了三十公里。侯福海还创纪录地拉了二千三百五十吨，超过了旧线的牵引定额。完全证实他们确实掌握了这条新线的性格。现在，他们的经验已被订作全段的爬坡措施。同时，上行牵引定额由一千八百吨提高到两千吨。整个车站货物机车二队执行这个措施以来，已经四十多天没有发生坡停事故或晚点。
