    Improving the Leadership Methods of Industrial Management Departments

    Many city industrial management departments are improving their leadership methods by referring to the spirit of the "two-five system" promoted in rural areas. For example, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has achieved good results by universally promoting the "one-three-two system" leadership method in industrial management departments.

    The "one-three-two system" leadership method first requires leaders at all levels to spend two days a week going deep into the front line of production, participating in production, and leading production, so that leaders at all levels are familiar with production, strengthen the connection between leaders and the masses, and facilitate the timely discovery of problems and guidance of production. Secondly, it requires leaders at all levels to spend three days a week conducting specific analysis and research on the information they have learned, collectively studying and solving problems according to the situation, solving problems on the spot or individually; at the same time, they should pay attention to summarizing good experiences with universal significance and promoting them universally through various methods. Thirdly, it allows each leader one day a week to study theory and policies, and in their studies, closely integrate theory with practice, and raise major issues that should be brought to the attention of enterprises, so that the research and summarization of work can be carried out on the basis of improving policy and theoretical levels, thereby gradually improving the leadership work level of cadres. The "one-three-two system" leadership method is a process from practice to theory, and from theory to practice; it is a process from the masses to the masses. The implementation of the "one-three-two system" leadership method has made it regular and systematic for leaders at all levels in industrial management departments to go deep into the front line, making administrative leadership and management work more accurate, detailed, and thorough, which is not only good for the continuous leap forward in production, but also a good measure for improving the leadership style of industrial management departments and raising the level of industrial management.

    To lead production well, continuously improve the level of industrial management, and enable our industrial production to develop continuously and stably, a fundamental issue is that industrial leaders must deeply understand production, must frequently discover problems, raise problems, and solve problems specifically; that is, to master the objective laws of production, so that our subjective understanding can conform to the objective reality of production. And this is even more important for comrades in industrial management departments, because the leaders of industrial management departments are one step further away from the reality of production than the leaders of enterprises, so going to the front line of production to participate in production and lead production is of more urgent significance.

    Industrial management department leaders participating in productive labor can, on the one hand, improve their work style and enhance their thinking through labor practice, and on the other hand, achieve practical results by gaining in-depth understanding, summarizing experiences, and guiding the overall situation. A typical example is the unity of individuality and commonality. It has both particularity and generality. This law also applies to industrial enterprises. Although the business and technology are different among various industrial enterprises and various types of work, many of them have commonalities in terms of leadership methods. Many experiences in leadership work are not only applicable to one enterprise, but also have guiding significance for many enterprises. The experience of Tianjin in promoting the "one-three-two system" leadership method fully proves this point. Some time ago, Tianjin launched a campaign to learn, catch up, surpass, and create advanced indicators, striving for five firsts (first in output, first in quality, first in variety, first in safety and hygiene, and first in cost reduction). In order to promote the advancement of the campaign, the Tianjin Light Industry Bureau adopted the "one-three-two system" leadership method. They first made a preliminary understanding of the overall situation, helped good factories and enterprises summarize their successful experiences, helped poor factories and enterprises study their lessons of failure, and quickly promoted the good experiences throughout the city, using points to guide the whole, so that the campaign could be carried out more deeply, healthily, and rapidly. Since Tianjin implemented the "one-three-two system" leadership method, the administrative leaders at all levels in the light industry sector alone have gone down to help create and summarize more than 20 leadership experiences that have been promoted throughout the industry or the city. This shows that after industrial department leaders have a fixed system for participating in production, their understanding of the reality of production has increased, and their familiarity with the laws of production has improved, so it is possible to quickly use individual and typical experiences to guide the general, promote the development of the increase production and practice economy movement, and further improve the level of enterprise management.

    The implementation of the "one-three-two system" leadership method can also bring a new look to the management work of industrial departments. Generally speaking, the business work of industrial management agencies is more complex and diverse, with many aspects such as planning and statistics, production technology, supply and sales finance, etc. Taking the supply and sales finance department alone, it is divided into procurement, allocation, warehousing, transportation, planning, accounting, statistics and so on. Due to the complexity of the business, people in the past thought that going to the front line of production was relatively difficult, so they were accustomed to sitting in the office listening to reports and waiting for numbers. Reports and numbers are certainly necessary, but it is obviously not enough to rely solely on these to lead production. The result is that more and more people come to the door, affairs become more and more busy, and going deep down becomes less and less. In the past, it was thought that this situation seemed difficult to change, but in fact it was not. After the Tianjin industrial administrative leadership organs implemented the "one-three-two system" leadership method, this situation changed. Leaders and business cadres at all levels of the business departments went down, and business work also went down. They implemented "ten-on-the-spot" which included the preparation of plans, production scheduling, technical guidance, material supply, product design, process design, inspection and analysis of output, quality and cost, labor protection, labor wages, living and welfare, etc. Professional cadres went down, combined with their own business, conducted investigations and research, and helped the lower levels solve specific problems. Obviously, this management method is much more proactive and effective than sitting in the office listening to reports and waiting for numbers. More importantly, this leadership method makes the staff of industrial leadership organs and grassroots enterprises more closely integrated, which greatly helps to improve the leadership style. Now, 85% of the leaders and business cadres of Tianjin's industrial administrative leadership organs can regularly go deep into the grassroots, making various business tasks very active and powerfully promoting the development of factories and enterprises.

    The "one-three-two system" leadership method is also a better way to adhere to and implement the mass line of working methods that are centralized, adhered to, and persisted in. After the cadres go deep into the grassroots, they have three days to discuss, study, and summarize work, and promote advanced experiences. This not only enables the problems discovered by the cadres during their deep-going production to be sorted out and improved through research, but also turns waiting for problems into actively looking for problems; from the bottom looking up to the top going deep down. As a result, there are fewer official documents, reports, and telephones, fewer general mobilization and deployment meetings, and timely exchanges of experiences and practical solutions to problems. When cadres go deep into production practice and participate in productive labor, they understand the production situation and the opinions of the masses, and increase their practical knowledge. These scattered, fragmented opinions and perceptual knowledge are collectively studied, concentrated, transformed into systematic work experience, and further elevated to policies and theories, and then promoted and implemented at a higher level. In this way, the work will inevitably become more practical, and the level of cadres will become higher and higher.

    The "one-three-two system" leadership method also guarantees cadres' time for studying theory and policies. This is extremely important. In this era of great leap forward, many new things and new contradictions are constantly emerging before us. To creatively embody the Party's guidelines and policies and continuously improve our work, we need to quickly improve the Marxist-Leninist theoretical level and policy level of cadres. After the implementation of the "one-three-two system" leadership method, cadres' one-day study time per week is guaranteed, and cadres' study can be regularized and institutionalized. Now, the vast majority of administrative leaders in Tianjin's industrial departments can persist in studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works and the Party's instructions, guidelines, and policies, and conduct research and discussions in connection with reality. Their learning is carried out on the basis of going deep into the grassroots and studying and summarizing work, which enriches the content of learning, allowing theory to be combined with practice, and learning better. Learning better, in turn, makes them more insightful and clear-headed during the process of going deep into work and summarizing work, and the work can be done better.

    In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, our industrial management work has been greatly improved, and many new creations and new experiences have been made in leadership methods and management methods, such as "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" and other management systems based on democratic centralism, which have played a great role in promoting the leap forward in production. Now, many cities are promoting the "one-three-two system" leadership method and other similar leadership methods in industrial management departments, which will inevitably have a good effect on promoting production. These tell us that in the process of socialist construction, the superstructure must constantly adapt to the needs of the economic base and constantly improve. The improvement of the level of industrial management is not just a simple technical business issue, but first and foremost an issue of leadership style and leadership methods. Every step forward in our leadership style and leadership methods means that we have taken a step forward in the ideological field, and our superstructure has been further improved. The new development of the superstructure will inevitably promote the further development of the economic base. Therefore, with the advancement of industrial production and construction, our leadership style and leadership methods must be constantly improved to meet the needs of continuous production development. At present, the increase production and practice economy movement centered on steel in industrial production is booming. The situation is infinitely good. Industrial management departments in various regions can refer to Tianjin's experience in promoting the "one-three-two system" leadership method to further improve leadership methods, better promote the in-depth development of the increase production and practice economy movement, better complete and over fulfill this year's national plan, and prepare for next year's production more fully and comprehensively.

    改进工业管理部门的领导方法
    许多城市工业管理部门参照农村推行“二五制”的精神，改进自己的领导方法。如中共天津市委，在工业管理部门中，普遍推行“一三二制”领导的方法，就取得了很好的效果。
    “一三二制”的领导方法首先要求各级领导干部每周有两天时间深入生产第一线，参加生产，领导生产，使各级领导干部熟悉生产，加强领导和群众的联系，以利于及时发现问题指导生产。其次，使各级领导干部每周有三天时间对所了解的情况进行具体分析、研究，分别情况集体研究解决，在现场解决或个别解决；同时注意总结出具有普遍意义的好经验，通过各种办法普遍推广。第三，使每个领导干部一周中有一天时间学习理论和学习政策，在学习中，密切结合实际，提出应当引起各企业注意的重大问题，使工作的研究、总结能在提高政策水平和理论水平的基础上进行，从而能逐步提高干部的领导工作水平。“一三二制”的领导方法是一个由实践到理论，又由理论到实践的过程，是一个由群众中来，到群众中去的过程。“一三二制”的领导方法的推行，把工业管理部门各级领导干部深入第一线经常化、制度化了，使行政领导工作、管理工作愈抓愈准，愈抓愈细，愈抓愈透，不仅对于生产的持续跃进有很好的作用，而且是改进工业管理部门的领导作风，提高工业管理水平的一个很好的措施。
    要领导好生产，不断地提高工业的管理水平，使我们的工业生产能持续地稳定地向前发展，一个根本的问题是工业的领导人员必须对生产深知深解，必须经常地发现问题，提出问题，并且具体地解决问题；也就是说要掌握生产的客观规律性，使我们的主观认识能符合生产的客观实际。而这一点，对于工业管理部门的同志来说，显得更加重要，因为工业管理部门的领导人员，比起企业的领导者，离生产实际又远了一层，因此到生产第一线去参加生产领导生产，就更有其迫切意义。
    工业管理部门的领导人员参加生产劳动，一方面能从劳动实践中，改进作风，提高思想，一方面又能取得深入一点、总结经验、指导全面的实效。典型，是个性和共性的统一，它既有特殊性，又有一般性，这个规律对于工业企业也是适用的。虽然在各个工业企业之间，各个工种之间，业务技术各不相同，但是从领导方法来看，许多是有共同性的。领导工作的许多经验，不仅对于一个企业适用，而对许多企业都有指导意义。天津市推行“一三二制”的领导方法的经验充分证明了这个道理。前些时，天津市开展学、赶、超、创先进指标，力争五个第一（产量第一、质量第一、品种第一、安全卫生第一、降低成本第一）运动，为了推动运动前进，天津市轻工业局即采用了“一三二制”的领导方法。他们首先对全面情况做了个初步了解，帮助好的工厂企业总结成功经验，帮助差的工厂企业研究失败教训，并迅速把好的经验在全市推广，以点指导面，使运动更深入、更健康、更迅速地开展起来。天津市自从推行“一三二制”的领导方法以来，仅轻工业部门各级行政领导干部深入下去帮助创造总结出来并在全行业或全市推广的领导经验就有二十多项。这说明：工业部门的领导人员，在有了固定参加生产的制度以后，对生产实际的了解增加了，对生产的规律性熟悉的程度提高了，因而有可能迅速地用个别的、典型的经验去指导一般，去促进增产节约运动的开展，并进一步提高企业的管理水平。
    “一三二制”的领导方法的推行，还能使工业部门的管理工作出现新的面貌。一般说来，工业管理机关业务工作比较复杂、多样，计划统计、生产技术、供销财务等等头绪很多，仅以供销财务一个部门来说，又分采购、调配、仓储、运输、计划、核算、统计等等方面。由于业务复杂，因而过去人们认为到生产第一线去是比较困难的，因而习惯于坐在机关里听汇报、等数字。汇报，数字，当然也是必要的，但光凭这些来领导生产显然是不行的，结果必然是找上门的越来越多，事务越办越忙，深入下去却越来越少。过去，认为这种状况似乎是很难改变的，其实不然，天津市工业行政领导机关推行“一三二制”的领导方法以后，就改变了这种状况。业务部门各级领导干部下去了，业务工作也下去了，他们实行了编制计划、生产调度、技术指导、材料供应、产品设计、工艺设计、产量质量和成本的检查分析、劳动保护、劳动工资、生活福利等等“十下现场”。专业干部下去，结合本身业务，进行调查研究，帮助下面解决具体问题。显然，这种管理方法比起坐在机关里听汇报、等数字要主动得多，也有效得多。更重要的是这种领导方法，使工业领导机关的工作人员和基层企业结合得更密切了，大大有助于领导作风的改进。现在，天津市工业行政领导机关，85％的领导干部和业务干部都能经常深入基层，使各项业务工作大为活跃，有力地推动了工厂、企业生产事业的发展。
    “一三二制”的领导方法，还是更好地坚持贯彻集中起来，坚持下去的群众路线的工作方法。干部在深入基层以后，有三天时间讨论、研究、总结工作，推广先进经验。这样就不仅使干部在深入生产期间所发现的问题，通过研究，得到整理和提高。而且由等问题变为主动找问题；由下边找上来，变为上面深下去。于是，公文、报表、电话少了，一般动员布置的会议少了，及时交流了经验，切实解决了问题。在干部深入生产实际和参加生产劳动的时候，了解了生产情况和群众的意见，增长了实践知识。这些分散的、零碎的意见和感性知识，经过集体研究，集中起来，化为系统的工作经验并进一步上升到政策、理论上来，然后再提高一步推广贯彻下去。这样，工作必然越做越切实，干部水平也越来越提高。
    “一三二制”的领导方法还保证了干部学习理论和学习政策的时间。这一点极为重要。在这大跃进的时代，许多新事物、新矛盾不断涌现到我们面前，要创造性地体现党的方针政策，不断地改进工作，就更加需要迅速提高干部的马克思列宁主义的理论水平和政策水平。推行“一三二制”的领导方法以后，干部每周一天学习时间有了保证，干部的学习能够经常化和制度化了。现在，天津市工业部门行政领导干部绝大多数人都能坚持学习毛泽东同志的著作和党的指示和方针、政策，并联系实际进行研究讨论。他们的学习是在深入基层和研究、总结工作的基础上进行的，这就使学习有了丰富的内容，可以理论结合实际，学得更好。学得更好，反过来在深入工作、总结工作期间，就心明眼亮，工作就能做得更好。
    几年以来，特别是大跃进以来，我们的工业管理工作已经有了很大的改进，在领导方法、管理方法上有了许多新的创造和新的经验，如“两参一改三结合”以及其它建立在民主集中制基础上的管理制度，对促进生产的跃进起了很大的作用。现在，许多城市在工业管理部门推行“一三二制”的领导方法和其他一些相类似的领导方法，也必然会发生促进生产的良好作用。这些，告诉我们：在社会主义建设的过程中，上层建筑必须要不断地适应经济基础的需要而不断改进。工业管理水平的提高，并不只是单纯的技术业务的问题，而首先是领导作风、领导方法的问题。我们的领导作风、领导方法，每改进一步，就意味着我们在意识形态领域内前进了一步，我们的上层建筑又有了新的改进。上层建筑有了新的发展，又必然反过来促进经济基础的进一步发展。所以随着工业生产和建设的前进，我们的领导作风和领导方法必须不断改进，才能适应生产不断发展的需要。现在，工业生产上以钢为中心的增产节约运动正在蓬勃展开。形势无限好，各地工业管理部门可以参照天津市推行“一三二制”领导方法的经验，进一步改进领导方法，更好地促进增产节约运动的深入开展，更好地完成和超额完成今年的国家计划，更充分更周密地作好明年生产的准备工作。
