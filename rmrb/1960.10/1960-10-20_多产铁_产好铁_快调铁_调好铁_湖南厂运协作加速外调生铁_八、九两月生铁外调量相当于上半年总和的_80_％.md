Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Electric Dispatch: The vast numbers of workers in Hunan Province's iron smelting and transportation departments are working closely together, striving to produce more iron, produce good iron, transfer iron quickly, and transfer iron well, to support the Daye Steel Plant and key steel plants in Shanghai and other places. The province exceeded its iron transfer plan by 8% in August and exceeded its iron transfer plan by 42.5% in September. The outward transfer volume of pig iron in these two months is equivalent to 80% of the total in the first half of the year.

The CPC Hunan Provincial Committee and Party committees at all levels attach great importance to the work of outward transfer of pig iron. The Provincial Committee has held many telephone conferences, educating cadres at all levels to resolutely implement the policy of "Central government first, local second, key projects first, general projects second," strengthen the overall perspective, and do a good job in iron transfer. The Provincial Committee also dispatched more than 100 cadres to form several working groups to go deep into key iron transfer areas to assist in the work.

Party committees at all levels are led by leading cadres, organizing command posts, and grasping iron transfer work on a ten-day and daily basis. Based on the spirit of advancing rather than lagging, all localities have fixed a large number of cars, ox carts, and wooden sailboats to undertake the short-distance collection and transportation of pig iron.

In the work of transferring pig iron to support key steel plants, the iron smelting departments closely cooperate. The workers of the iron smelting departments actively assist the workers of the transportation departments to speed up loading and unloading and improve transportation efficiency. All iron plants have established professional loading and unloading teams, weighing the pig iron to be transferred in advance, and stacking it according to the different load capacities of the vehicles to ensure that the vehicles are loaded as soon as they arrive. In the past, the average time for cars to stop at the factory for loading was more than one or two hours, but now it has been reduced to about 20 minutes. The transportation department takes the initiative to contact the iron plants, jointly arrange transportation plans, arrange transportation capacity in a timely manner, and seize the time for transportation. They also consulted with the iron plants to simplify transportation procedures. Transportation departments have also strengthened cooperation, closely coordinating, and breaking regional boundaries to support each other. For example, at the end of September, Yunshan Iron Plant in Wugang County had more than 300 tons of pig iron to be transferred to Daye Steel Plant. At that time, the Shaoyang Highway Bureau had a heavy transportation task and could not dispatch vehicles for a while. The Qianyang Highway Bureau took the initiative to dispatch ten vehicles to help rush for two days, and transported 300 tons of pig iron to the railway station for collection and transportation.

In order to supply the best pig iron to key iron and steel enterprises, the Provincial Metallurgical Department arranged for 25 iron plants, including Limin, Lianyuan, Shaodong, Lengshuijiang, and Renmin, which have good pig iron quality and convenient transportation, to undertake the production tasks of outward transfer of pig iron. While actively increasing output, many iron plants paid special attention to improving the quality of pig iron. Youxian Renmin Iron Plant insisted on carefully selecting ore and strictly following operating procedures to ensure that fine materials entered the furnace. The qualification rate of pig iron in September increased from 81.2% in August to 95.5%, and the output also increased significantly compared with August. (Attached picture)

Shandong Province, based on the spirit of "external first, internal second," is continuously increasing the transfer of pig iron to support key iron and steel enterprises in Shanghai and other places. This is the pig iron supported by Qingdao's iron and steel enterprises to Shanghai being loaded onto ships for outward transportation.

### 多产铁　产好铁　快调铁　调好铁  湖南厂运协作加速外调生铁  八、九两月生铁外调量相当于上半年总和的80％

    多产铁　产好铁　快调铁　调好铁
    湖南厂运协作加速外调生铁
    八、九两月生铁外调量相当于上半年总和的80％
    新华社长沙电　湖南省炼铁部门和运输部门的广大职工紧密协作，努力多产铁、产好铁，快调铁、调好铁，支援大冶钢厂和上海等地的重点钢厂。全省8月份超额8％完成调铁计划，9月份又超额42.5％完成了调铁计划，两个月的生铁外调量相当于上半年总和的80％。
    中共湖南省委和各级党委很重视外调生铁的工作。省委曾多次召开电话会议，教育各级干部坚决执行“先中央后地方，先重点后一般”的方针，加强全局观点，做好调铁工作。省委还抽调了一百多名干部组成若干工作组，深入重点调铁地区协助工作。
    各级党委都由领导干部挂帅，组织指挥部，按旬按日抓调铁工作。各地本着赶前不赶后的精神，固定了大批汽车、牛马车、木帆船，担负生铁短途集运任务。
    在外调生铁支援重点钢厂的工作中，炼铁部门紧密协作。炼铁部门的职工主动协助运输部门的职工加快装卸速度，提高运输效率。各铁厂都成立了专业装卸队，提前将要外调的生铁过好磅，按车辆的不同载重量，分堆堆码，保证车子随到随装。过去汽车停厂待装的时间平均在一、二小时以上，现在压缩到二十分钟左右。运输部门则派干部主动同各铁厂联系，共同安排调运计划，及时安排运力，抓紧运输。他们还同铁厂协商，简化了调运手续。运输部门之间也加强协作，紧密配合，并打破地区界限互相支援。如9月底，武冈县云山铁厂有三百多吨生铁要调往大冶钢厂，当时邵阳公路局运输任务较重，一时调不出汽车，黔阳公路局就主动抽出十部汽车帮助突击了两天，将三百吨生铁抢运到火车站集运地点。
    为了以最好的生铁供应重点钢铁企业，省冶金部门安排利民、涟源、邵东、冷水江、人民等二十五个生铁质量好、交通方便的铁厂担负外调生铁的生产任务。许多铁厂在积极增加产量的同时，特别注意提高生铁质量。攸县人民铁厂坚持精选矿石，严格操作规程，做到精料入炉，9月份的生铁合格率就由8月份的81.2％提高到95.5％，产量也比8月份有很大增长。（附图片）
    山东省本着“先外后内”的精神，源源不断地增调生铁支援上海等地重点钢铁企业。这是青岛市各钢铁企业支援上海的生铁正装船外运
