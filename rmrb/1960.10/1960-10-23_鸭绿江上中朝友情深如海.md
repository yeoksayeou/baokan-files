In autumn, the Yalu River is flanked by weeping willows and vibrant maple leaves. In the golden rice paddies, the working people of China and North Korea are busily harvesting. They look across the river at each other, greeting each other warmly, sometimes even singing together, praising Korea's Chollima and China's Great Leap Forward. Waves of joyful songs of friendship float on the Yalu River.

The people of China and North Korea get along well on both sides of the Yalu River, as close as brothers. During the years of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the Chinese people on the north bank witnessed the suffering of their Korean brothers and sisters on the south bank and could no longer bear it. Some joined the Volunteer Army and stretcher teams, crossing the river to defeat the vicious American bandits together with the Korean people. Today, the people on both sides support and encourage each other, diligently engaging in production and construction, linking happiness and joy together. They often visit each other, and warmly congratulate each other on every new experience and new achievement. More than 100 workers at the Andong Paper Mill once participated in the Volunteer Army. Now, in their production posts, they frequently exchange experiences with the Korean workers at the Sinuiju Paper Mill. Farmers on both sides also constantly exchange experiences to promote the continuous development of agricultural and sideline production. In September, a North Korean agricultural delegation from North Pyongan Province came to the north bank to introduce to the Wulongbei People's Commune in Andong City their experience in achieving a bumper rice harvest by adopting the "hotbed seedling cultivation method," and brought back the experience of the Chinese People's Commune in planting vegetables, raising pigs, and raising silkworms. They excitedly said that our visits not only exchanged many valuable experiences, but also made the combat friendship forged with blood by the people of China and North Korea blossom and bear fruit in today's construction undertakings.

At the mouth of the Yalu River, white sails dot the water and fishing songs are melodious, as fishermen from China and North Korea cast their nets side by side. When Chinese fishermen discover large schools of fish, they call out to their Korean fishing brothers; when the radios on Korean fishing boats hear weather forecasts, they quickly inform the Chinese fishermen. They haul in their nets together and return to port together. Sometimes, due to the changeable sea climate, sudden storms strike, and if fishing boats are in distress, the fishermen of China and North Korea will fight bravely to rescue each other, sharing life and death. Last winter, a Korean fishing boat was capsized by a strong wind. Seven or eight fishermen from the Langtou People's Commune in Andong City immediately jumped into the icy water to rescue the three Korean brothers in distress, carrying them to the heated kang in their homes, brewing ginger soup for them, giving them clothes to change into, starting a charcoal fire to keep them warm, and making the best food for them to eat. After two days, the three rescued Korean fishermen recovered their health. The Chinese fishermen also gave each of them new overcoats and new shoes and socks, and happily sent them back to their country. In April of this year, another Korean boat at the mouth of the Yalu River was blown by a strong wind of force six or seven and crashed into a stone reef. The boat was breached, leaked water and sank. The Langtou People's Commune immediately sent more than 50 fishermen to rescue them, allowing all six Korean crew members to escape danger. Chinese fishermen are also sincerely cared for by Korean fishermen. In September, the fishing boat captain Xue Shishan and others of the Langtou People's Commune’s fishing team encountered a storm in the sea at the mouth of the Yalu River. The raging waves hit the sides of the boat one after another, and the boat kept shaking. In this critical situation, a patrol boat from the Cholsan Dam Maritime Transport Enterprise in North Korea rushed to the scene and immediately rescued the Chinese fishing boat from the raging waves and invited them to their fishing port to take shelter from the wind. After the boat anchored and docked, the Korean fishermen greeted them like old friends, bringing vegetables and cigarettes and warmly entertaining them. When the wind subsided and the waves calmed and Xue Shishan and others were about to go out to sea, the Korean fishermen sent a large box of apples, holding the hands of the Chinese fishermen tightly and saying, "This is a small token of our appreciation, please take it back for your Chinese brothers to taste. Korea is riding the Chollima, and China is making a Great Leap Forward. We are brothers and comrades-in-arms, let us jointly achieve greater harvests in the ocean!"

In August of this year, the Yalu River swelled, and the Yalu River People's Commune on the north bank was surrounded by floods. Late at night, people in danger suddenly heard the sound of a motor from the south. It turned out to be a Korean motorboat coming to rescue their Chinese brothers. The motorboat stopped in front of a willow tree, and several Korean boatmen, rowing two small boats, broke through the waves and headed in the direction of the cries for help. Before long, more than 200 people were safely transferred to the motorboat. As the boat was about to leave, female commune member Li Zhongqin suddenly remembered that Commune Director Song Chuan was still at home, and she quickly wrote a few simple Chinese characters to the Korean boatmen. The Korean boatmen, who were about to set sail, saw that there was still an old man waiting to be rescued, and that he was a "patriotic old man" who had worked hard in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, donating airplanes and cannons, so they immediately rowed their small boats, broke through the flood again, and rescued Song Chuan. The seventy-year-old Song Chuan held the hand of the Korean boatman tightly, tears streaming down his face.

The people on both sides of the Yalu River also spread many beautiful stories, stirring the hearts of millions with friendship. In August, a Korean woman from North Pyongan Province, Li Fengshan, came to China for some business. Before she could return to North Korea, she was about to give birth, which was very difficult for her. However, the people of the Langtou People's Commune in Andong City, upon hearing the news, immediately decided to take good care of her. Cook squad leader Li Chunshan, a veteran of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, took the initiative to give up his house, moving into the kitchen himself, and sending his wife and young daughter to his father-in-law's house. Women's team leader Lü Xiuqin and a group of women also happily came to help. Li Chunshan comforted Li Fengshan like an older brother, saying, "This is your home, don't be a stranger." On a snowy night in the winter of 1951, Li Chunshan's team was marching and camping in the home of an "Amani" (mother) near Xuancheon in North Korea. They were afraid of disturbing the host and quietly went to sleep in the kitchen. Suddenly, the door creaked open, and when a gray-haired "Amani" saw that they were volunteers, she pulled them one by one to the warm kang, brought out quilts for everyone to cover, treating them like her own children. Now that a Korean sister has come to China, how could Li Chunshan ignore her? He not only gave up his house, but also ran home three times a day from the cafeteria to feel if the kang was warm, instructing Lü Xiuqin and the others to take good care of her.

At ten o'clock in the morning on August 7th, a fair-skinned and chubby Korean baby girl was born in the home of this former volunteer soldier in China. The good news spread throughout both sides of the Yalu River. Li Cijin (transliteration), vice chairman of the People's Committee of North Pyongan Province, North Korea, said: "We must give this child a name that symbolizes Sino-Korean friendship, so that our people will be loyal friends of the Chinese people for generations to come." Zhu Yongshun, an old Korean doctor who was in Andong City, named the girl Jin Zhongshan. He said: "The word 'Jin' represents the Korean people led by Marshal Kim Il-sung, and the word 'Zhong' represents the Chinese people. The meaning of Jin Zhongshan is that the people of China and North Korea will always be friendly." Li Fengshan was very happy to hear this. The women of the Langtou People's Commune also sent a gift to the child to express their congratulations.

The child is about to leave the country with her mother. The Korean comrades joked: "This is a small guest without an entry visa." The Chinese comrades said: "Her name is her visa."

    鸭绿江上中朝友情深如海
    新华社记者  姜庆肇  李健羽  安东日报记者  罗继姝
    秋天，鸭绿江两岸垂柳掩映，枫叶艳艳。在金黄色的稻田里，中朝两国的劳动人民都在忙碌着收割。他们隔江相望，亲切招呼，有时还对唱起来，歌唱朝鲜的千里马和中国大跃进。一阵阵欢乐友谊的歌声，飘荡在鸭绿江上。
    鸭绿江两岸的中朝人民友好相处，亲如兄弟。在抗美援朝战争的年代里，北岸的中国人民亲眼看到南岸朝鲜兄弟姊妹们身受的苦难，忍无可忍，有的参加志愿军和担架队，跨过江去，同朝鲜人民一起打败了凶恶的美国强盗。今天，两岸人民又互相支援，互相鼓舞，勤劳地从事着生产建设，把幸福欢乐联结在一起。他们经常往来，参观访问，每有一项新的经验和新的成就，就热烈祝贺。安东造纸厂的工人曾经有一百多名参加过志愿军，现在他们在生产岗位上和新义州市造纸厂的朝鲜工人经常交流经验。两岸的农民，也是不断交流经验，促进双方农副业生产不断发展。9月里，朝鲜平安北道农业考察团到江北岸来，一面向安东市五龙背人民公社介绍了他们采取“温床育苗法”取得水稻丰收的经验，一面把中国人民公社在种植蔬菜、养猪、养蚕等方面的经验带回去。他们兴奋地说，我们的参观访问，不仅交流了许多宝贵经验，而且使朝中两国人民当年用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊，在今天的建设事业中开花结果。
    鸭绿江口上，白帆点点，渔歌悠扬，中朝两国渔民们并肩撒网。中国渔民们发现了大鱼群，唤来朝鲜的渔家弟兄；朝鲜渔船上收音机听到气象预报，就赶紧通报中国渔民，他们一块儿收网，一块儿回港。有时候，由于海上气候多变，暴风突然袭来，有的渔船遇险了，中朝两国渔民就奋力抢救，同生死共患难。去年冬天，一只朝鲜渔船被大风打翻了，安东市浪头人民公社的七八个渔民立即跳下寒冷刺骨的水里抢救，把三个遇难的朝鲜兄弟打捞上来，并且把他们背到自己家里的热炕头上，烧了姜汤给他们喝，拿出衣服给他们换上，生起炭火给他们取暖，做最好的饭给他们吃。两天后，这三个被救的朝鲜渔民恢复了健康。中国渔民给他们每人又换上了新大衣，新鞋袜，欢送他们回国。今年4月，又一只朝鲜船在鸭绿江口被六七级大风刮得撞到石礁上，船破漏水下沉，浪头人民公社立即派出五十多名渔民前往抢救，使朝鲜六名船员全部脱险。中国渔民也得到朝鲜渔民的衷心爱护。9月，浪头人民公社渔业队船长薛世山等驾驶的一只渔船，在鸭绿江口的海面上遇到风暴，汹涌的浪涛一个接一个地打到船舷上，船不停地摇晃起来。正在危急当中，朝鲜铁山堤海运事业所巡逻船赶来，立即从惊涛骇浪中救出了这只中国渔船，并且请到他们的渔港去避风。船抛锚停泊后，朝鲜渔民像老朋友似地前来迎接，并且带来蔬菜和香烟，热情款待。当风平浪静，薛世山等要出海时，朝鲜渔民又送来了一大箱苹果，紧紧握着中国渔民的手说：“这是我们的一点小心意，请带回去给中国弟兄们尝尝。朝鲜跨上了千里马，中国正在大跃进。我们是弟兄又是战友，让我们共同在海洋上取得更大的丰收吧！”
    今年8月，鸭绿江江水暴涨，北岸鸭绿江人民公社被洪水围困。深夜，处在危险中的人们，忽然听到从南面传来了哒哒的马达声，原来是一只朝鲜汽船赶来营救中国弟兄们。汽船停在一棵柳树前，几位朝鲜船工划着两只小船冲破巨浪，分头向求救的方向驶去。不多时，二百多群众都妥善地送到汽船上。当船要开走时，女社员李忠琴突然想起公社主任宋传义还在家里，她连忙给朝鲜船工写了几个简单的汉字。正要开船的朝鲜船工们一看还有一位老人待救，而且他是抗美援朝运动中勤劳生产捐献飞机大炮的“爱国老人”，便立即划着小船，再一次冲破洪水急流，把宋传义救了出来。七十多岁的宋传义紧握着朝鲜船工的手，两眼流出了热泪。
    鸭绿江两岸的人民，还传颂着许多美丽的佳话，激动着千万颗友谊的心。8月里，平安北道一位朝鲜妇女李凤善有事到中国来，她还没有来得及回朝鲜就要分娩了，她十分为难。可是安东市浪头人民公社的人们闻讯后，便立即决定很好照顾她。炊事班长李春山是抗美援朝的老战士，他主动把房子让出来，自己搬到伙房里住，把妻子和小女儿送到岳父家。妇女队长吕秀琴和一群妇女们，也高高兴兴地来帮忙。李春山像亲哥哥似地安慰李凤善说：“这就是你的家，千万不要见外。”1951年冬天的一个大风雪夜里，李春山一班人行军宿营在朝鲜宣川附近的一位“阿妈尼”（妈妈）家里。他们怕打搅主人，悄悄地在厨房睡下。忽然房门吱嘎一声响，一位头发斑白的“阿妈尼”一见是志愿军，便一个一个地拉到暖烘烘的炕上，搬出被子给大家盖，真像对待自己的亲生儿女一样。如今朝鲜的姊妹来到中国，李春山哪能不管呢，他不但让出房子，还一天三次从食堂跑回家，摸摸炕头热不热，叮嘱吕秀琴她们要好好照应。
    8月7日上午十点钟，一个又白又胖的朝鲜小女孩，诞生在中国这位前志愿军战士家里了。喜讯传遍了鸭绿江两岸。朝鲜平安北道人民委员会副委员长李次进（译音）说：“一定给这个孩子取一个象征朝中友谊的名字，让我们的人民世世代代都作中国人民的忠实朋友。”正在安东市的朝鲜老汉医朱永顺给这个女孩起名叫金中善。他说：“‘金’字表示金日成元帅领导的朝鲜人民，‘中’字表示中国人民，金中善的寓意就是朝中两国人民永远友好。”李凤善听了非常喜欢。浪头人民公社的妇女们还给孩子送了一份礼品，表示祝贺。
    孩子随着母亲要离境回国了。朝鲜同志打趣地说：“这是个没有入境签证的小客人。”中国同志说：“她的名字，就是签证。”
