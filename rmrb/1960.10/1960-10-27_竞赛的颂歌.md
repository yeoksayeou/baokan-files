    Ode to Competition
    Wu Lü
    In our country, the content of competition is so rich and its significance so profound that perhaps not everyone can immediately grasp it. Today's news and reports in this newspaper about the competition between the No. 1 Steel Plant and the No. 3 Steel Plant's open-hearth furnace workshops, though merely a drop of water in the ocean of competition sweeping across urban and rural areas of the country, unfold before us a magnificent picture full of meaning, leaving us with lasting impressions and deep thoughts.
    The competition between these two workshops has been going on for several years. Now, the No. 1 Steel Plant has regained the national high-yield red flag for small open-hearth furnaces, which had been held by the No. 3 Steel Plant for two years. However, the competition is not over. Who will lead in the next national evaluation meeting for small open-hearth furnaces is still unknown. It is in this intense and heated competition that all four open-hearth furnaces of the two plants have entered the ranks of advanced national furnaces, and production is rising step by step.
    However, this is far from the entire result of this competition. Higher than the red arrows indicating production leaps on the charts is the continuously developing communist friendship between the workers of the two plants in this competition. Sending "reinforcements" in the middle of the night, delivering blueprints three times, jointly refining "friendship steel"—each section and each paragraph shines with the light of communist ideology. Here, there is no distinction between you and me. Your difficulty is my difficulty, and my experience is your experience. Those running ahead wholeheartedly help those running behind, wanting to help those behind catch up; those running behind offer their best experience to those running ahead, wanting to make the advanced even more advanced. They are two families with one heart. This is not the imagined demeanor of the "Gentleman's Country" in "Flowers in the Mirror," but the reality of the Chinese people's lives. This is the most sublime word in the human dictionary: communist competition!
    More than forty years ago, in his article "A Great Beginning," Lenin called communist subbotniks "the beginning of a revolution that is more difficult, more substantial, more profound, and more decisive than the overthrow of the bourgeoisie," "because it is a victory over one's own conservatism, disunity, and petty-bourgeois egoism, a victory over the habits that accursed capitalism has left to the workers and peasants." Isn't the competition between the No. 1 Steel Plant and the No. 3 Steel Plant's open-hearth furnace workshops, and the thousands upon thousands of similar competitions in urban and rural areas across the country, precisely such a "beginning of a revolution that is more difficult, more substantial, more profound, and more decisive than the overthrow of the bourgeoisie"? Moreover, this beginning did not start today, and this revolution has already produced profound results. All kinds of bourgeois ideological dross are being eliminated like garbage, and communist thought fills the hearts of millions of workers. This is an invincible material force.
    Labor transforms the world and also transforms the laborers themselves. Communist labor competition is a great communist furnace. It builds the foundation for the future communist edifice and also builds the new communist man. This huge furnace is burning with a raging fire, emitting glittering golden light, attracting more and more people to throw themselves into its embrace!

### 竞赛的颂歌

    竞赛的颂歌
    吴滤
    竞赛，在我们的国家里，它的内容有多么丰富，它的意义有多么深长，恐怕不是每一个人都能一下子就测定出来的。今天本报发表的上钢一厂和上钢三厂两个平炉车间竞赛的新闻和通讯，虽只是席卷全国城市和乡村的竞赛海洋中的一滴水珠，却在我们的面前展开了一幅意味无穷的瑰丽的图画，令人久久难忘，深思不已。
    这两个车间之间的竞赛已经进行了几年了。现在是上钢一厂把被上钢三厂夺去了有两年之久的全国小型平炉的高产红旗重新夺了回去。但是，竞赛并没有结束。下一次的全国小型平炉评比会议上谁家领先，还是一个未知数。就在这种紧张热烈的竞赛中，两个厂的四座平炉都跨进了全国先进平炉的行列，生产正在一步一步地上升。
    然而，这远不是这场竞赛的全部成果。比表格上生产跃进的红箭头冲得更高的，是在这场竞赛中两个厂的工人不断发展着的共产主义的情谊。半夜派“援兵”，三次送图纸，共炼“友谊钢”，一节节，一段段，都闪烁着共产主义思想的光辉。这里，不分你我。你的困难就是我的困难，我的经验就是你的经验。跑在前面的，满腔热情地帮助跑在后面的，要帮后面的赶上前来；跑在后面的，拣自己最好的经验送给跑在前面的，要让先进的更先进。是两家人，共一颗心。这不是“镜花缘”里幻想的“君子国”风度，这是中国人民生活的现实，这是人类辞典上最崇高的字眼：共产主义的竞赛！
    四十多年前，列宁在“伟大的创举”一文中，曾经把共产主义星期六义务劳动称做是“比推翻资产阶级更困难、更重大、更深刻、更有决定意义的变革的开端”，“因为这是战胜自身的保守、涣散和小资产阶级的利己主义，这是战胜万恶的资本主义遗留给工农的习惯”。上钢一厂和上钢三厂两个平炉车间之间的竞赛，以及全国许多城乡千千万万类似的竞赛，不也正是这样一种“比推翻资产阶级更困难、更重大、更深刻、更有决定意义的变革的开端”吗？而且，这个开端并不是从今天才开始的，这个变革已经产生了深刻的结果。形形色色资产阶级思想的渣滓，正像垃圾一样被排除出去，共产主义的思想填满了千千万万劳动者的心胸，这是不可战胜的物质的力量。
    劳动，改造着世界，也改造着劳动者自己。共产主义的劳动竞赛是一座共产主义的大熔炉。它为未来的共产主义大厦建设着基础，也建设着共产主义的新人。这座巨大的熔炉正燃着熊熊的烈火，放着闪闪的金光，吸引着越来越多的人投入它的胸怀！
