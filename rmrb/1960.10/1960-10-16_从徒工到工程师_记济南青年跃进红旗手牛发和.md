From Apprentice to Engineer
    ——Remembering Jinan Youth Leap Forward Red Banner Bearer Niu Fahe
    Su Aihua, Yu Peiyu
    Not long ago, the Jinan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League issued a notice calling on all young workers in the city to learn from Niu Fahe’s spirit of bold innovation. Many young workers are actively responding to this call.
    Niu Fahe is only twenty years old this year. He was originally a young auto repair worker at Jinan Iron and Steel Plant. Under the cultivation of the Party, he worked hard and diligently. In less than four years after joining the factory, he grew from an ordinary auto repair apprentice to a mechanical engineer, and was hired by Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant as a special designer.
    First Showing
    In June 1958, Niu Fahe was transferred to the basic construction site of Jinan Iron and Steel Plant. At that time, he was assigned to the power station responsible for repairing cars. This was a newly established department, and the equipment consisted of only a few old and incomplete repair machines. At that time, it was a tense construction period. Basic construction workers implemented rapid construction, and transportation workers were divided into three shifts, with machines working constantly, doing everything possible to accelerate transportation speed, but still unable to meet construction needs. However, cars in need of major repairs were sitting idle in the power station. It took several months to overhaul one, which made the transportation workers very anxious. What to do? The Party branch issued a call: declare war on manual operation, and seek high efficiency through mechanization and semi-mechanization!
    Manually loading and unloading automobile tire hoist heads was a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. Long ago, Niu Fahe had wanted to use machinery to replace manual labor. The Party's call prompted his long-dormant innovative seeds to "break ground" and be born. However, he also worried that his technical skills were poor and that he would not be able to succeed.
    Just as Xiao Niu was hesitating, the Party branch secretary announced Xiao Niu's innovation plan at the station's employee meeting, and encouraged him to stand tall and get to work. The experienced masters in the same group also extended warm hands: "Xiao Niu, you come up with ideas, and we'll help you."
    The beginning is always the hardest. Xiao Niu only had an elementary school education and had never systematically studied technical theoretical knowledge, and he couldn't even draw a machine sketch. Late at night, Niu Fahe couldn't sleep. He found some wire, weaving and dismantling, dismantling and weaving, and after several days of weaving, he finally created a machine model for loading and unloading automobile hoist heads. The enthusiastic Master Fang and Master Qiu helped him collect materials for building the machine everywhere after work. Some materials needed to be processed, which the power station couldn't handle, so Master Fang went to the basic construction site and processed them during people's shift changes.
    They conducted experiments time and time again over a period of more than a month, and the results were repeated failures. Niu Fahe's heart became anxious.
    At this critical juncture, the Party branch secretary found him again: "Xiao Niu, take a break, I'll tell you a little story. Have you heard of a member of the Communist Youth League in Tianjin, about your age, who experimented a total of 322 times in order to eliminate Salmonella in egg products before succeeding. Think about it, if he had lost confidence in the 321st experiment and didn't persevere, what would have happened?"
    "That's right, success comes from failure, and to make something happen, you have to see it through to the end." Encouraged by the Party and supported by his comrades, Xiao Niu persisted in his experiments, and finally, after experiencing twenty-one failures, he created a clever automobile tire loading and unloading device, which increased work efficiency by twenty-five times compared to manual operation and greatly reduced physical labor.
    Continuous Revolution
    On December 21, 1959, this excellent member of the Communist Youth League joined the Party. The lofty ideals of communism inspired him, and he was determined to continuously revolutionize and reduce the time spent repairing cars to the minimum.
    At that time, the time for overhauling cars was very long, and the fundamental key was the lack of equipment for milling and grinding engine cylinders. This kind of equipment was very precise, and only two auto repair shops in Jinan at that time had this kind of machine. Therefore, when the Jinan Iron and Steel Plant power station overhauled cars, they had to send the engine cylinders there for milling and grinding. Each time an engine cylinder was sent, it would take at least a month to be milled and ground, and sometimes it would take more than three months.
    The leadership attached great importance to this key issue and had already made a budget to purchase a modern milling and grinding cylinder equipment. However, they were unable to buy one for the time being. The repair workers, led by Niu Fahe, proposed: "If we can't buy a foreign one, let's make a native one."
    The battle began, and everyone enthusiastically supported Niu Fahe and other young men in their innovation efforts. They needed a small motor, so the workshop director removed it from the grinder and gave it to them; they needed various gears and parts, so the workers picked them out from the scrap pile. The native-made cylinder grinding machine was initially assembled, but due to the slightly bent vertical shaft, the cylinders ground out had large errors and could not be used. After the Party branch learned about this, it immediately helped them analyze the reasons for the failure and firmly pointed out: "It doesn't matter, let alone the fact that we have no experience, even large factories fail during their initial tests." They encouraged Xiao Niu and the others to "learn from their mistakes" and resolutely make the cylinder grinding machine a success.
    Under the leadership of the Party, Xiao Niu and his comrades learned from the lessons of the first failed experiment, corrected the bent part of the vertical shaft, and changed the oilstone to a long milling cutter, combining the milling and grinding processes into one. After collective research and improvement, they finally successfully trial-produced a native cylinder grinding machine, and the accuracy of the cylinders ground out was fully qualified.
    In the past two years, Niu Fahe and his comrades in the whole group have innovated more than one hundred machine tools, which has greatly improved the mechanization level of the whole group and greatly shortened the car repair time. The time for maintaining a car has been reduced from three days to one day, three hours, and even less than one hour.
    Diligent Study and Hard Practice
    As an auto repair worker, being familiar with the car's "temperament" should be like a doctor being familiar with the body's meridians! Niu Fahe is constantly moving towards this goal.
    Once, a car that was waiting to be repaired in the warehouse had a broken half-shaft screw. Xiao Niu knew that this was caused by exceeding the "torque" load, but because he didn't understand technical theory, he just couldn't calculate it. Another time, a car needed to replace a new crankshaft, and a technician calculated for a long time but couldn't find the right gear, and the car couldn't start. From these two incidents, Xiao Niu came to a conclusion: the working class cannot be slaves to technology, but must be masters of technology; to be a good working-class fighter, one must master scientific and technological theory. Since then, he has bought technical theory books such as "Automobile Repair Science" and borrowed "Automobile Mechanic's Reader" and other technical theory books for assiduous study.
    In his daily work, Xiao Niu humbly asked the masters for advice, and also achieved a combination of learning and application, and consistency between learning and application. Almost every vehicle he had repaired had a "medical record file." Where was the car's problem? Why did this problem occur? How was this problem solved? He carefully remembered everything in comparison with the book's introduction and practical experience. Through such accumulation and diligent study, Xiao Niu's technical level improved rapidly. In the past few years, the station has repaired vehicles from the Soviet Union such as "ZIS" and "GAZ", Czechoslovakia's "Tatra", Germany's "IFA", and so on. Xiao Niu not only understood the "temperament" of these cars and mastered the complete set of major, medium, and minor repair techniques, but also was able to foresee and eliminate hidden faults. For vehicles sent to the warehouse for maintenance, sometimes he could find out where the problem was just by listening carefully. Therefore, his partners often discussed and said: "Niu Fahe's ears are more sensitive than a stethoscope!"
    High Skill and Boldness
    As the saying goes, "High skill brings boldness." Niu Fahe's scientific and technological level is rapidly improving, and his ambition for innovation is even greater. A few years ago, he only dared to touch the hoist head for loading and unloading car tires, but now he dares to question the design of cars.
    This spring, just as the nationwide technical revolution movement was developing vigorously, Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant sent a letter soliciting suggestions for innovating the design of the "Liberation" brand car. After the news spread, people began to discuss:
    "What else can be changed about the newly produced 'Liberation' brand car!"
    Niu Fahe thought to himself: "It's only been a few years since liberation, and our working class has produced cars. Why can't we let it climb to the highest peak of the world's automobile manufacturing industry again?" At that time, the Party branch also encouraged everyone: "Practice is the standard for testing truth. We tinker with cars all day long, so think more, study more, and we can always come up with some ideas!" Since then, Niu Fahe, when repairing cars, thought about every screw he unscrewed and every part he installed: What is the function of this? Can it be improved? Can it be removed? Even parts that he had touched countless times, he would mark with a question mark and ponder for a long time.
    When disassembling the tire screws of the "Liberation" brand car, he found that one cap only managed a single tire, with sixteen large screw caps installed inside and outside, while the Czechoslovakian ten-ton truck "Tatra" had one cap managing double tires. He thought: "If the tires of the 'Liberation' brand car were also changed to one cap managing double tires, each wheel could save several screws, then how much steel could a factory that produces tens of thousands of cars a year save, and how much manpower and equipment could be saved!" Small accounts are afraid of large calculations. The more Xiao Niu calculated, the more he realized the feasibility, and immediately put forward this suggestion and solicited the opinions of his partners.
    At first, some people raised questions: "When they designed it this way in the beginning, whether there was one more screw or one less screw, there was a scientific basis, so we can't mess with it!"
    "That's right, we can't change it randomly without a basis." Xiao Niu agreed with this view, and at the same time raised another question: "Can we say that the 'Liberation' brand car is perfect and can never be improved?"
    When he asked this, everyone felt that it made sense. He also continued to persevere in his research. On the one hand, he repeatedly compared the "Liberation" brand with other brands of cars, and on the other hand, he asked technicians to help with scientific calculations. The calculation results proved that changing double-layer screws to single-layer screws could not only ensure quality, but also have spare load capacity. Then, he and his group members worked together to study, based on the requirements of saving labor, saving materials, and simplifying processes, and put forward more than ten innovative suggestions such as improving axle screws and eliminating shock absorbers.
    Soon, the design department of Changchun First Automobile Factory replied in a letter, deciding to adopt the innovative suggestions such as "one cap managing double tires" and improving the processing technology of half-shaft screws. According to calculations, the "one cap managing double tires" alone can save nearly a thousand tons of steel per year. Now, Changchun First Automobile Factory has officially hired him as a special designer.
    Niu Fahe and all his comrades in the group worked hard and came through a difficult journey. From January to August this year, the whole group completed the workload of three years and five months. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League awarded him certificates of merit and the honorary title of Youth Leap Forward Red Banner Bearer.

    从徒工到工程师
    ——记济南青年跃进红旗手牛发和
    苏爱华　于沛雨
    不久以前，共青团济南市委发出通知，号召全市青工学习牛发和的大胆革新精神。许多青工正在积极响应这一号召。
    牛发和今年才二十岁，原是济南钢铁厂青年汽车修理工。他发愤图强，埋头苦干，在党的培育下，入厂不到四年，就由一个普通的汽车修理徒工，成长为一个机械工程师，并被长春第一汽车制造厂聘为特约设计员。
    初试锋芒
    牛发和在1958年6月调到济南钢铁厂基本建设工地。当时，他被分配到负责维修汽车的动力站。这是个新成立的部门，设备就是几部陈旧不全的修理机具。那时候，正是紧张的施工关头。基本建设工人实行快速施工，运输工人分成三班，歇人不歇车，千方百计加速运输速度，但是仍然不能满足施工需要。而需要大修的汽车，却摆在动力站里。大修一辆，要几个月的时间，运输工人好不心焦。怎么办呢？党支部发出号召：向手工操作宣战，向机械化、半机械化要高工效！
    手工装卸汽车轮胎葫芦头，是个既费力又费工的活儿。很早以前，牛发和就想用机械代替手工。党的号召，促使他那潜伏已久的革新萌芽“破土”出生。可是，他也担心自己技术差，怕搞不成。
    正当小牛有些犹豫不决的时候，党支部书记在全站职工大会上宣布了小牛的革新打算，并且鼓励他要挺起腰来干。同组的老师傅们，也都伸出了热情的手：“小牛，你想点子吧，大伙帮你干。”
    万事开头难。小牛只有小学文化程度，过去也没有系统地学过技术理论知识，连个机器的草图也不会画。深夜，牛发和怎么也睡不着。找了些铁丝，编编拆拆，拆拆编编，编了好几天，总算编出了一个装卸汽车葫芦头的机器模型。热心的方师傅和丘师傅，下班以后，到处帮助他搜集造机器的材料。有些材料需要加工，动力站没法解决，方师傅就到基本建设工地，趁着人家换班的空隙加工。
    他们在一个多月的时间内一次又一次地进行试验，结果都一次接着一次地失败了。牛发和的心里急躁起来。
    就在这个节骨眼上，党支部书记又找到了他：“小牛，歇一回，给你讲个小故事。你听说过没有：天津有个共青团员，大概跟你的年龄差不多，他为了消灭蛋品中的沙门氏菌，一共试验了三百二十二次才成功。你想，要是他试验到第三百二十一次丧失了信心，不再坚持干下去，结果会怎样呢？”
    “对，成功是从失败中得到的，要干出个样子来，就得干到底。”在党的鼓舞和同志们的支持下，小牛坚持进行试验，终于在经历了二十一次失败后，制成了一台灵巧的汽车轮胎装卸器，比手工操作提高工作效率二十五倍，并且大大地减轻了体力劳动。
    不断革命
    1959年12月21日，这个优秀的共青团员入了党。共产主义的远大理想鼓舞着他，他决心不断革命，把修车的时间压缩到最低限度。
    当时，大修汽车的时间很长，其根本关键，就是由于缺乏铣、磨汽缸的设备，这种设备很精密，当时济南只有两家汽车修理厂有这种机器。所以，济南钢铁厂动力站大修汽车时，就只得把汽缸送到那里铣、磨。每次送去的汽缸，至少也得一个月才能铣好、磨好，有时要耽搁三个多月。
    对于这个关键，领导上很重视，早就作了预算，准备买一台现代化的铣、磨汽缸的设备。但是，一时没有买到。以牛发和为首的修理工们提出：“买不到洋的，咱就弄个土造的。”
    战斗开始了，大家都热烈地支持牛发和等青年小伙子们搞革新。他们需要小马达，工段长就从砂轮上拆下来，交给他们使用；需要各种齿轮和部件，工人们就到废料堆里挑选。土造磨缸机初步装成了，但是由于立轴有点弯，磨出来的汽缸误差很大，不能用。党支部知道后，立即帮助他们分析失败的原因，并且坚定地指出：“没有关系，别说是咱们没经验，初次试验，就是大工厂也有失败的时候。”鼓励小牛他们要“吃一堑，长一智”，坚决把磨缸机制造成功。
    在党的领导下，小牛他们接受了第一次试验失败的教训，矫正了立轴的弯曲部分，改油石为长铣刀，使铣、磨工序两者合一。这样经过集体研究改进，终于试制成功了一部土磨缸机，磨出来的汽缸，精密度完全合格。
    两年来，牛发和和全组同志革新的机器工具达百余项，使全组机械化程度大大提高，汽车的修理时间大大缩短。保养一台车的时间，由三天压缩到一天、三小时，直至一小时以内。
    勤学苦练
    作为一个汽车修理工，熟悉车子的“脾性”，应该像医生熟悉人的机体脉络一样！牛发和时刻都在朝着这个目标迈进。
    有一次，一部入库待修的汽车，半轴螺丝折断了。小牛明知道这是超过“扭力”负荷造成的，可是因为自己不懂技术理论，就是不会计算。还有一次，一部汽车要更换一根新曲轴，一位技术员算了半天，总是找不对齿，车子发动不起来。从这两件事当中，小牛得出一个结论：工人阶级不能作技术的奴隶，一定要作技术的主人；要当好一个工人阶级战士，必须掌握科学技术理论。从此，他买来了《汽车修理学》，借来了《汽车技工读本》等技术理论书籍，刻苦攻读。
    在日常工作中，小牛虚心向师傅请教，并且做到了学用结合，学用一致。凡是他经手修过的车辆，几乎每台都有“病历档案”。车子的毛病出在哪里？为什么出了这种毛病？这种毛病是怎样解决的？他都对照书本介绍，对照实践经验，记得仔仔细细。这样日积月累，刻苦钻研，小牛的技术水平提高得飞快。几年来，全站修过的车辆，有苏联的“吉斯”“嘎斯”，捷克斯洛伐克的“太脱拉”，德国的“依发”，等等。小牛不但摸透了这些车子的“脾性”，掌握了整套的大、中、小修技术，而且能够预见和排除隐形故障。对于入库保修的车辆，有时经他侧耳一听，就可以发现毛病出在哪里。因此，伙伴们常常议论说：“牛发和的耳朵比听诊器都灵！”
    艺高胆大
    俗话说：“艺高胆大”。牛发和的科学技术水平在迅速提高，闹革新的雄心也更大了。几年前，他只敢碰一碰装卸汽车轮胎的葫芦头，现在他敢于对汽车设计打打问号了。
    今年春天，正当全民性的技术革命运动蓬勃发展的时候，长春第一汽车制造厂发来了一封信，征求对革新“解放牌”汽车设计的建议。消息传出后，人们纷纷议论起来：
    “‘解放牌’这种新生产的汽车，还有啥可改的！”
    牛发和心里想：“解放才这么几年，咱们工人阶级就造出了汽车，为什么不能让它再攀上世界汽车制造业的最高峰呢？”当时，党支部也鼓励大家：“实践是检验真理的标准，咱们整天摆弄汽车，多想想，多钻钻，总可以想出点门道来！”从此，牛发和在修车时，每卸一个螺丝钉，装一个零件，都要动一番脑筋：这个有没有作用？能不能改进？能不能改掉？甚至摸过无数遍的零件，他也要打上个问号，琢磨一大阵子。
    他在拆卸“解放牌”汽车轮胎螺丝时，发现一帽只管单胎，里外装有十六个大螺丝帽，而捷克斯洛伐克十吨载重汽车“太脱拉”，却是一帽管双胎。他就想：“如果‘解放牌’的轮胎也改为一帽管双胎，每个轮子都能节省几个螺丝，那么一个年产十几万辆汽车的厂子，该能节约多少钢材，节省多少人力和设备啊！”小账就怕大算。小牛越算心里越落实，立时就把这个建议提了出来，征求伙伴们的意见。
    起初，有人提出疑问：“人家当初这样设计时，多一个螺丝，少一个螺丝，都有科学根据，这可不能乱动啊！”
    “对，不能没根据地乱改。”小牛同意这种看法，同时也提出了另一种疑问：“能不能说，‘解放牌’汽车就十全十美，永远不能改进了呢？”
    这一问，大家觉得有道理。他也继续坚持钻研下去。他一面拿“解放牌”与其他牌号的汽车反复比较，一面又请技术员帮助作科学计算。计算结果证明：改双层螺丝为单层螺丝，不仅可以确保质量，而且负荷还有余力呢。接着，他又和组员们一起研究，本着省工、省料、简化工艺等要求，提出了改进车轴螺丝和取消减震器等十多项革新建议。
    不久，长春第一汽车厂设计处复了信，决定采纳“一帽管双胎”和改进半轴螺丝加工工艺等革新建议。据计算，仅“一帽管双胎”一项，一年就可节约钢材近千吨。现在，长春第一汽车厂已正式聘请他为特约设计员了。
    牛发和同他全组的同志们发愤图强，从一段艰苦的历程中走过来了。全组今年1月到8月份，完成了三年零五个月的工作量。因此，共青团中央和共青团山东省委分别发给他奖状，并授予青年跃进红旗手的光荣称号。
