　　Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 19th -- According to Prensa Latina, Havana, industrial enterprises, shops, and banks recently nationalized by the Cuban revolutionary government are operating normally. The new managers or supreme inspectors of these enterprises have received enthusiastic support from workers and staff.

　　Almost all workers' organizations in these enterprises have made resolutions to increase production and make cooperation between enterprises more effective. Workers at a brewery in Santiago increased daily output by 24,000 bottles after learning that the factory had been nationalized. Cuban flags and slogans paying tribute to the nationalization measures and revolutionary slogans were hung in the windows of nationalized banks and shops. People flocked to the nationalized shops early in the morning, another demonstration of support for this revolutionary measure.

　　The National Land Reform Committee is responsible for managing 329 of the 382 large enterprises that have been nationalized.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 18th -- According to local newspapers, Cuba has decided to withdraw from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, according to an order issued by the President of Cuba.

　　The order pointed out that "the Republic of Cuba has no reason to remain in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development because the economic policies implemented by this institution are far from effectively promoting the development and expansion of the Cuban economy planned by the Cuban revolutionary government through its well-formulated plans."

    古巴工人热烈支持国有化政策
    古巴宣布退出国际复兴开发银行
    新华社19日讯　据拉丁美洲通讯社哈瓦那消息，最近被古巴革命政府收归国有的工业企业、商店和银行活动正常。这些企业的新的管理人或最高监察代表都受到了工人和职员们的热烈支持。
    在这些企业中差不多所有的工人组织都做出了增加生产和使各企业间的协作更加有效的决议。圣地亚哥一家啤酒厂的工人在知道了这家工厂被收归国有以后把日产量提高了二万四千瓶。在收归国有的银行和商店的橱窗上挂着古巴国旗以及向国有化措施致敬和写着革命口号的标语。人们从一清早就拥进了被收归国有的商店，这是支持这一革命措施的又一表现。
    土地改革全国委员会负责管理三百八十二家被收归国有的大企业中的三百二十九家企业。
    新华社哈瓦那18日电　据此间报纸报道，根据古巴总统颁布的命令，古巴决定退出国际复兴开发银行。
    命令指出，“现在古巴共和国没有理由留在国际复兴开发银行中，因为这个机构执行的经济政策远不能有效地促进古巴革命政府通过它完善地制定的计划所规划的古巴经济的发展和扩大。”
