Fenyang Promotes Jicun Management Area Experience
All Contracted Units Vigorously Grasp the "Three Autumns" Work, Striving for Over-Production and Over-Harvest

(Reported by our newspaper) The Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, is widely learning and promoting the "three guarantees and one reward" experience of the Jicun Management Area of the Xingfu (Happiness) Commune in promoting the autumn harvest, which has powerfully promoted the autumn harvest and autumn planting work.

As early as September 15th, Fenyang County sent a work team to delve into the Jicun Management Area of the Xingfu Commune to summarize the experience of implementing the "three guarantees and one reward." The county party committee promptly notified the entire county to study and discuss this experience.

In the discussions, various localities have improved their ideological understanding of implementing the "three guarantees and one reward" and have actively requested to implement it. For example, of the ten management areas of the Zhao Jiajie Commune, only two management areas originally implemented the "three guarantees and one reward," while the remaining management areas planned to temporarily not implement it. After study and discussion, the commune party committee extracted eight cadres to earnestly strengthen leadership. The "three guarantees and one reward" of the summer was concluded well, and the "three guarantees and one reward" for next year's wheat and the trial calculation and cash-out of the autumn "three guarantees and one reward" were formulated well. Therefore, the wheat sowing of the entire commune was completed on time with quality and quantity, ensuring full and vigorous seedlings. During the autumn harvest, 50% of the grain fields were finely harvested, finely gleaned, finely transported, and finely threshed, ensuring that every grain was returned to the granary.

After careful calculation of the "three guarantees and one reward" cash-out throughout the county, the wheat planting and autumn harvest work was powerfully promoted. As of October 4th, the county had sown more than 200,000 mu of wheat, accounting for 81% of the sowing plan. While planting wheat and harvesting the autumn crops, the county organized 10% of the labor force to carry out a "small autumn harvest" campaign to increase the income of commune members. The slogan of everyone is: Over-producing teams strive for more over-production and over-harvest, average-producing teams strive for over-production and over-harvest, and reduced-production teams strive for less reduced production and less reduced harvest, or no reduced production and no reduced harvest. The county is now universally carrying out inspection and trial calculation of the "three guarantees and one reward" cash-out work to prepare for the final accounting.

    汾阳推广冀村管理区经验
    各包产单位狠抓三秋工作力争超产超收
    本报讯　山西汾阳县普遍学习推广幸福公社冀村管理区“三包一奖”促秋收的经验，有力地推动了秋收秋种工作。
    汾阳县早在9月15日即派出工作组，深入幸福公社冀村管理区，总结贯彻“三包一奖”兑现的经验。县委将这一经验及时通报全县学习讨论。
    各地在讨论中，提高了对执行“三包一奖”的思想认识，都积极地要求执行“三包一奖”。如赵家街公社十个管理区，原来只有两个管理区执行“三包一奖”，其余几个管理区准备暂不实行。经过学习讨论，公社党委抽出了八个干部，认真加强领导。将夏季的“三包一奖”结束好，又制定好明年的小麦“三包一奖”，和秋天的“三包一奖”试算兑现。因此全社的小麦下种作到了按质按量按时完成，保证了苗全苗旺。秋收中，有50％的粮田，作到了细收、细拾、细运、细打，保证了颗粒归仓。
    全县经过细算三包一奖兑现，有力地推动了种麦秋收工作。截至10月4日，全县共种小麦二十多万亩，占播种计划的81％。在种麦秋收的同时，全县组织了10％的劳力，开展了“小秋收”运动，以便增加社员收入。大家的口号是：超产队争取更多地超产超收，平产队争取超产超收，减产队争取少减产少减收、不减产不减收。现在全县普遍开展检查试算三包一奖的兑现工作，为决算进行准备。
