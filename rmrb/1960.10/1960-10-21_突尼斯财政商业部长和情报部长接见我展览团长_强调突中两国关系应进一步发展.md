Yu Liguang, head of the Chinese exhibition delegation, said that the people of China and Tunisia have had common experiences in the past. Naturally, it is our common aspiration to develop relations between the two countries.

Masmoudi emphasized that Tunisia has suffered from colonialism. He said, "We must consolidate the independence of our country."

Yu Liguang, head of the Chinese exhibition delegation, said that imperialism in the past separated the Tunisian people from the Chinese people. However, there are friendly relations between Tunisia and China today, and imperialism can never prevent the further development of friendly relations between the two countries. Yu Liguang expressed his respect for the Tunisian people's struggle against imperialism and the achievements Tunisia has made since independence.

Accompanied personally by Minister of Information Masmoudi, the head and deputy head of the Chinese exhibition delegation visited the printing house of the Ministry of Information, where two printing presses were donated by the Chinese exhibition delegation that participated in the fair last year.

    强调突中两国关系应进一步发展
    新华社突尼斯18日电　突尼斯财政和商业部长艾哈迈德·迈斯提里今天说，突尼斯和中国的关系应该迅速地发展。迈斯提里是在接见参加突尼斯第八届国际博览会的中国展览团团长和副团长时讲这番话的。
    迈斯提里还说，发展两国之间的贸易和经济关系是必要的也是可能的。双方都可以在彼此的市场上找到感到兴趣的商品。这位部长希望中国展览馆获得完全的成功。中国展览团团长于黎光说，中国突尼斯两国人民在过去有过共同的遭遇，很自然，发展两国的关系也是我们的共同愿望。于黎光团长还对突尼斯政府对中国馆的帮助表示感谢。
    新华社突尼斯17日电　突尼斯政府情报部长穆罕默德·马斯穆迪今天接见了参加这里国际博览会的中国展览团团长于黎光和副团长岳岱衡。
    马斯穆迪着重指出，突尼斯受到殖民主义的折磨。他说，“我们必须巩固我们国家的独立。”他又说，“我们的愿望是建设我们的国家，而不是成为军事基地。”他确信，中国在建设国家和解决他们所面临的问题方面有丰富的经验。
    中国展览团团长于黎光说，帝国主义过去使突尼斯人民同中国人民隔离开来。但是，突尼斯和中国之间今天存在着友好的关系，帝国主义决不能阻止两国之间友好关系进一步的发展。于黎光对突尼斯人民反对帝国主义的斗争和突尼斯在独立以后所取得的成就表示敬意。
    在情报部长马斯穆迪的亲自陪同下，中国展览团团长和副团长参观了情报部的印刷所，那里有两架印刷机是去年参加博览会的中国展览团赠送的。当中国参观者走进印刷所的时候，工人们以热烈的掌声表示欢迎。
