This Newspaper Guangzhou Dispatch, October 23: In order to ensure that all existing tractors in the province fully play their role in the upcoming winter cultivation, Guangdong Province's mechanical industry departments, starting from the third quarter, designated some factories to concentrate their efforts on producing tractor parts. By the end of September, the main factories producing tractor parts in the province had all completed or nearly completed their annual parts production tasks ahead of schedule.

In recent years, Guangdong Province's agricultural machinery has increased significantly. There are now more than 3,800 standard tractors in the province's rural areas. They will cultivate ten million mu of land this winter and next spring. To ensure that all existing tractors are put into operation during winter cultivation, the mechanical industry departments need to greatly grasp the production of tractor parts. The Guangdong Tractor Factory has established a special line for the production of tractor parts, led by the deputy director. They also designated professional personnel, dedicated lathes, and dedicated materials. By the end of September, this factory had produced more than 270 tons of parts, totaling more than 53,000 pieces, exceeding the original annual production task by 30% three months ahead of schedule. Now, this factory has accepted a new task to produce more parts in the fourth quarter. The Guangzhou Lianguang Automobile Parts Manufacturing Factory has completed all the tractor parts it contracted to produce on time, in quantity, with quality, and in variety. By October 16, this factory had completed 50% of its parts production task for the fourth quarter. Many repair factories that did not originally undertake tractor parts production tasks took the initiative to share the parts production tasks. For example, after tapping its production potential, the Guangzhou Gangfeng Automobile Parts Manufacturing Factory took the initiative to contact the agricultural machinery and materials supply station and contracted to produce a batch of valves, push rods, oil pump shafts, and other products.

This Newspaper Wuhan Dispatch, October 23: The industrial departments of Xiangyang Special District, Hubei Province, have adopted the method of "four deliveries" (farm tools delivered to the door, parts delivered to the door, repairs delivered to the door, and technology imparted to the door) to support rural people's communes in repairing and replenishing farm tools, in order to do a good job in autumn planting and prepare for spring plowing production next year. More than 3,500 repair and assembly teams, composed of 18,000 technicians from the entire district, have already gone deep into the front line of autumn planting with their luggage, tools, and parts to carry out activities of repairing and improving old-fashioned farm tools and imparting the technology of using new-style farm tools.

After the end of the summer harvest, the vast number of workers in the Xiangyang area immediately responded to the call of the local party committee and began to repair and replenish "three autumns" tools. In August and September, the entire district repaired and assembled 900,000 pieces of various autumn sowing tools, manufactured and improved more than 200,000 pieces of various farm tools, and delivered these farm tools to the production teams in a timely manner before autumn sowing.

Currently, this area has entered the high tide of autumn planting. During the intense autumn planting campaign, some farm tools were damaged, some farm tools needed to be improved, and some farmers also needed to further improve their skills in using new-style farm tools. Based on this situation, a large number of workers went deep into the front line of autumn planting to repair and improve farm tools on the spot and impart technology. After a large number of workers from Zaoyang County arrived at the production teams and small teams, they promptly repaired more than 1,500 ten-row strip seeders (times), and repaired and assembled more than 24,600 pieces of various plows, harrows, flatbed trucks, etc., which powerfully promoted the autumn planting work. After the employees of the Guanghua County Farm Tool Factory arrived at the Tongsheng Production Team of the Bailian Commune, they not only helped the commune members repair a large number of farm tools, but also, within ten days, worked with the commune members to improve all 280 old-fashioned plows of the entire team, increasing work efficiency by 30%. Before autumn sowing, Yunxi County manufactured 1,600 "Pang-style" three-row automatic strip seeders, but because some farmers did not know how to use them, they did not fully play their role. The employees went to the production teams and trained more than 3,000 strip sowing operators on the spot, so that the three-row automatic strip seeders were all used very well.

    保证农业机具在秋种冬耕中充分发挥威力
    广东机械工业赶制拖拉机配件  襄阳工人下乡修农具传授技术
    本报广州23日电　广东省机械工业部门为了保证全省现有拖拉机在即将到来的冬耕中充分发挥作用，从第三季度开始，就指定一部分工厂集中力量生产拖拉机配件。到9月底止，全省生产拖拉机配件的主要工厂，全年的配件生产任务都已提前超额完成或接近完成。
    广东省的农业机械这几年增加很多，全省农村的拖拉机已有三千八百多标准台。它们将在今冬明春耕地一千万亩。为了保证现有的拖拉机在冬耕生产中全部上阵，机械工业部门需要大抓拖拉机配件的生产。广东拖拉机厂为此建立了拖拉机配件生产的专线，由副厂长负责领导。他们还指定了专业人员、专用的车床和专用材料。到9月底止，这个厂已生产配件二百七十多吨，共五万三千多件，提前三个月超额30％完成了原定的全年生产任务。现在，这个厂又接受了新的任务，要在第四季度生产更多的配件。广州联光汽车零件制造厂承制的拖拉机配件，全部做到按时、按量、按质、按品种完成任务。这个厂第四季度的配件生产任务，到10月16日止，已经完成50％。许多原来没有承担拖拉机配件生产任务的修配厂，主动要求分担配件生产任务。如广州钢烽汽车零件制造厂经过挖掘生产潜力，主动同农业机械物资供应站联系，承制了一批气门、推杆、油泵轴等产品。
    本报武汉23日电　湖北省襄阳专区工业部门采取“四上门”（农具送上门，配件送上门，修理送上门，技术传授送上门）的办法，支援农村人民公社修理和补充农具，以便搞好秋种，并为明年春耕生产作好准备。全区由一万八千个技术工人组成的三千五百多个修配组，已经带着行李、工具和配件深入秋种第一线，展开修理和改良旧式农具、传授新式农具使用技术的活动。
    襄阳地区广大职工在夏收结束以后，立即响应地委的号召，着手修理和补充“三秋”工具。8、9两月，全区共修好配好各种秋播工具九十万件，制造和改良了各种农具二十多万件，并且在秋播前把这些农具及时送到了生产队。
    目前，这个地区已进入秋种高潮。在紧张的秋种运动中，有些农具损坏了，有些农具需要改良，有些农民使用新式农具的技术也需要进一步提高。根据这一情况，大批工人又深入秋种第一线，就地修理和改良农具，传授技术。枣阳县的大批工人到生产队和小队以后，及时修好十行条播器一千五百多部（次），修好配好各种犁耙、板车等二万四千六百多件，有力地推动了秋种工作。光化县农具二厂职工到白莲公社同升生产队以后，不仅帮助社员修好大批农具，而且在十天内，同社员一道把全队二百八十部旧式犁都改良了，提高工效30％。郧西县在秋播前制造了一千六百部“庞公式”三行自动条播器，因为有些农民不会使用，没有充分发挥作用。职工们到生产队，在现场训练了三千多名条播手，使三行自动条播器都很好地使用起来。
