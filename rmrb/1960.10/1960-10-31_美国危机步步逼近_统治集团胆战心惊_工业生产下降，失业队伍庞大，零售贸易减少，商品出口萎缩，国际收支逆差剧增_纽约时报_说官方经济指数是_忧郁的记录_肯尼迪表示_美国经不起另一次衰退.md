Xinhua News Agency, New York, 30th - A new economic crisis storm is casting an increasingly deep shadow over the United States on the eve of the election.

Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy, in a campaign speech on the 27th, took the opportunity to attack the Republican government, saying that the United States is clearly entering "the third recession in six years (the Republican Party has been in power for eight consecutive years from 1952 to this year)". He said, "We cannot afford another recession."

"U.S. News & World Report," the mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capital, also believes in its latest issue that the trend of the U.S. economy is an important issue in the November election. More and more people are anxiously watching the prospect of economic deterioration, worrying that unemployment will increase further, income will decrease further, and their wallets will become more empty. This volatile situation has caused anxiety among the American ruling group. The Democratic and Republican parties are fiercely arguing in the presidential election campaign on how to deal with the continued development of the "economic recession."

The signs of a new crisis appearing in the U.S. economy, which began this summer, have seen significant developments since autumn. Production in various important industrial sectors has continued to decline, the unemployment ranks are large, private debt is high, domestic retail sales are declining, commodity exports are shrinking, and the international balance of payments deficit is increasing sharply.

The production of the three important pillars of the U.S. economy—steel, automobiles, and construction—has been declining continuously since the third quarter of this year. The operating rate of the steel industry has only maintained about 50% since the summer. In July and September of this year, the operating rate even fell below 50% several times. Throughout the third quarter, steel production declined month by month. U.S. monopoly capital had hoped that the automobile industry, which consumes a large amount of steel, would stimulate the steel industry by changing the production of 1961 models in the third quarter, but steel production in September fell by more than 400,000 tons compared to the sluggish August. Many automobile companies purchased large quantities of steel after the steel workers resumed work at the beginning of this year, so they not only do not need to purchase new steel, but also have a large amount of steel in stock. Since October, the operating rate of steel production has remained only slightly above 50%.

The production and sales of automobiles in the third quarter were also not good. It is estimated that automobile production in the third quarter decreased by 35% compared to the second quarter. Although production rebounded somewhat in September due to the change to the production of new 1961 models, this caused new problems. Since old models have not yet been sold and new models are being launched one after another, automobile inventories had increased to 800,000 vehicles by October 1, which is 200,000 more than the same period last year.

In the construction industry, although the U.S. government has used methods to reduce mortgage loan conditions to stimulate housing construction, the rate of housing construction has recently continued to decline. The annual rate of housing construction in September decreased by 29% compared to the same period last year, reaching the lowest point in twenty-one months. Now, newly built houses that cannot be sold are everywhere in the United States.

In addition to the above-mentioned important industrial sectors in the United States, the production of many other industrial sectors, such as machinery manufacturing, furniture, building materials, textiles, chemicals, paper making, and non-ferrous metals, has also been generally declining recently.

The U.S. industrial production index for September, which was recently announced by the U.S. government, has fallen to the lowest point this year—107 (with the 1957 average as 100), a decrease of four points from this year's peak. The annual rate of gross national product in the third quarter fell to $503 billion, a decrease of $2 billion from the second quarter. "The New York Times" wrote that the main economic indicators for September announced by the U.S. government "are a depressing record."

U.S. corporate investment this year will also decline compared to what was expected at the beginning of the year. According to a recent report in "The Wall Street Journal," U.S. corporate investment this year will be only $36 billion, instead of the $37 billion expected at the beginning of the year.

For a long time, the United States has maintained a large unemployment force. The current number of unemployed people is still close to four million. It is reported that the current unemployment rate in the United States accounts for 5.7% of the national labor force. This is a phenomenon that has not occurred since the end of the economic crisis of 1957-1958. "U.S. News & World Report" recently conducted a survey of unemployment in various regions of the country. The survey results pointed out that there is a large amount of unemployment in thirty-one of the fifty states in the United States, including one hundred and fifty-five constituencies. The most serious are the industrial and mining centers of steel, automobiles, and coal mines.

At the same time, prices in the United States are constantly rising. Since February of this year, the U.S. cost of living index has risen almost every month. According to the U.S. Department of Labor's announcement on October 26, the U.S. cost of living index for September has risen to an unprecedented peak of 126.8% of the 1947-1949 average, an increase of 1.3 points from a year ago. In September, almost all consumer goods except used cars rose in price. A Labor Department spokesperson admitted that the cost of living continued to rise in October.

The serious unemployment problem and rising prices have caused the actual income of ordinary American workers to decline continuously, and private debt to rise continuously. According to a recent survey conducted by "U.S. News & World Report," the actual income of workers in dozens of industrial sectors, such as steel, aircraft, ships, textiles, and furniture, has generally declined this year. The largest decline was for steel industry workers, a decrease of 12% compared to 1959. According to the survey, the amount of private debt that needs to be repaid every week in the United States currently reaches more than one billion U.S. dollars, which is equivalent to one-sixth of the national after-tax personal income. American newspapers pointed out that while the two major parties in the United States are loudly campaigning, people are more concerned about how to find a job and keep their "purses."

According to a report in "U.S. News & World Report" on October 17, U.S. retail sales have fallen by 4% since April, and durable consumer goods have fallen even more, reaching 8%.

The U.S. vigorously launched a campaign to increase foreign exports at the beginning of the year, but it has not brought about an export "boom." Since the summer of this year, commodity exports have been declining steadily, and the international balance of payments deficit has been growing rapidly again. According to an announcement by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board on the 27th, the annual rate of the U.S. international payments deficit in the third quarter has risen to a peak of four billion U.S. dollars, which is eleven billion U.S. dollars higher than the second quarter. The Associated Press pointed out in its report that the sharp increase in the international balance of payments deficit "certainly makes the U.S. financial authorities feel frustrated."

Not only in the United States, but the entire capitalist world market also strongly feels that a new U.S. economic crisis is approaching. Under this circumstance, waves of panic buying of gold and runs on the U.S. dollar have occurred continuously in the capitalist world market recently. Associated Press economic commentator Dawson pointed out that "the new wave of gold buying in London and elsewhere involves the credibility of the U.S. dollar and doubts about the U.S. economic trend." "The New York Times" said that this is "another dangerous signal" to the United States.

Faced with these ominous signs, even American bourgeois newspapers and economists are increasingly of the opinion that no matter what measures the U.S. government takes, it will not be able to escape a new "serious economic recession." Janeway, general manager of the New York Janeway Research Corporation, who is considered one of the important bourgeois economists in the United States, recently pointed out in New York that "today's economic decline will develop into tomorrow's crash." He said, "The next president—whether Republican or Democrat—will inherit a serious recession."

    美国危机步步逼近　统治集团胆战心惊
    工业生产下降，失业队伍庞大，零售贸易减少，商品出口萎缩，国际收支逆差剧增
    “纽约时报”说官方经济指数是“忧郁的记录”　肯尼迪表示“美国经不起另一次衰退”
    新华社30日讯　纽约消息：一次新的经济危机风暴的阴影正越来越深沉地笼罩着选举前夕的美国。
    民主党总统候选人肯尼迪27日在竞选中乘机攻击共和党政府的演讲里说，美国显然正在进入“六年来（从1952年起到今年共和党已连续执政八年）的第三次衰退”。他说，“我们是经不起另一次衰退的”。
    美国垄断资本的喉舌“美国新闻与世界报道”在最近一期中也认为，美国经济的趋势是11月选举中的一个重要问题。越来越多的公众焦虑地注视经济恶化的前景，他们担心失业会更增多，收入会更减少，他们的钱包会更加干瘪。这种动荡的局势引起美国统治集团的不安。民主党和共和党在总统竞选运动中正激烈争吵着如何应付“经济衰退”继续发展的问题。
    今年夏天开始出现的美国经济将走向一次新危机的迹象，入秋以来有了显著的发展。各重要工业部门的生产不断下降，失业队伍庞大，私人债台高筑，国内商品零售额下降，商品出口萎缩，国际收支逆差剧增。
    美国经济的三个重要支柱——钢铁、汽车和建筑工业，自从今年第三季度以来生产不断下降。钢铁工业的开工率从今年夏天以后，一直只保持50％左右。在今年7月和9月，开工率还数度下降到50％以下。在整个第三季度中，钢铁产量逐月下降。美国垄断资本曾经希望由于大量消耗钢铁的汽车工业在第三季度改换1961年型汽车的生产，而给钢铁工业带来刺激，但是9月份的钢铁生产却比不景气的8月份又下降了四十万吨多。许多汽车公司由于在今年年初钢铁工人复工后大量购进钢铁，不仅不需购进新钢，而且手中还有大量存钢。10月份以来，钢铁生产开工率仍然只有50％多一点。
    第三季度汽车生产和销售情况也不妙。据估计，第三季度汽车产量比第二季度减少了35％。虽然在9月份由于改换1961年型新汽车生产，产量有些回升，但是这却引起了新的问题，由于旧型汽车还没有销出去，而新型汽车又纷纷出厂，到10月1日为止汽车存货已增加到八十万辆，比去年同期多二十万辆。
    在建筑业方面，虽然美国政府用降低抵押贷款条件的办法来刺激房屋建筑，但房屋建筑率最近仍然不断下降。9月份的房屋建筑年率比去年同时期下降了29％，达到二十一个月以来的最低点。现在，美国全国已经到处都有卖不出去的新建成的房屋。
    除了上述这些美国重要工业部门之外，其他像机器制造、家具、建筑材料、纺织、化学、造纸、非铁金属等许多工业部门的生产，最近也在普遍地下降。
    不久前美国政府公布的9月份美国工业生产指数已下降到今年以来的最低点——一零七（以1957年平均数为一百），比今年的最高峰下降了四点。第三季度的国民生产总值年率下降到五千零三十亿美元，比第二季度减少了二十亿美元。“纽约时报”写道，美国政府公布的9月份的主要经济指数“是一个令人忧郁的记录”。
    美国今年的企业投资同年初预料的相比，也将有下降。据“华尔街日报”不久前报道，今年美国企业投资将只有三百六十亿美元，而不是年初预料的三百七十亿美元。
    长期来，美国一直保持着一支庞大的失业队伍。目前失业人数依然接近四百万。据报道，现在美国失业人口占全国劳动力的5.7％。这是1957—1958年的经济危机结束以来未曾有过的现象。“美国新闻与世界报道”最近对全国各地区的失业情况进行了一次调查，调查结果指出，现在在美国全国五十个州当中，有三十一个州，包括一百五十五个选区，存在着大量失业的现象，其中最严重的是钢铁、汽车、煤矿等工矿业中心。
    同时，美国物价不断上涨。从今年2月以来，美国的生活费用指数差不多是月月上涨。据美国劳工部10月26日宣布，9月份美国的生活费用指数已上涨到1947—1949年平均数的126.8％的空前高峰，比一年前上涨了一点三。在9月份里，除旧汽车以外，几乎所有的消费品都涨价了。劳工部发言人承认，10月份生活费用还在继续上涨。
    严重的失业问题和物价的上涨，造成美国普通劳动人民的实际收入不断下降，私人债务不断上升。据“美国新闻与世界报道”最近所进行的调查表明，钢铁、飞机、轮船、纺织、家具等数十个工业部门工人的实际收入今年都普遍下降，其中钢铁工业工人下降得最多，比1959年下降了12％。据调查，目前美国私人债务每周需要偿还的数额达到十亿多美元，相当于美国全国纳税后个人收入的六分之一。美国报刊指出，在美国两党大吹大擂进行竞选的时候，人民更关心的是如何能找到职业和保住自己的“钱袋”。
    据“美国新闻与世界报道”10月17日报道，目前美国商品零售额已经比4月下降了4％，而其中耐用消费品下降更多，达到8％。
    美国年初大力开展增加对外出口运动也没有能带来出口“繁荣”。从今年夏天以来，商品出口便节节下降，国际收支逆差重新急剧增长。据美国联邦储备委员会27日宣布，第三季度美国国际支付逆差年率又增高到四十亿美元的高峰，比第二季度高十一亿美元。美联社在报道中指出，国际收支逆差的急剧增加，“肯定使得美国财政当局感到沮丧”。
    不仅是美国国内，整个资本主义世界市场也强烈预感到美国新的经济危机正在逼近。在这种情况下，资本主义世界市场上最近连续发生了抢购黄金、挤兑美元的浪潮。美联社经济评论员道逊指出，“伦敦和其他地方抢购黄金的新风潮牵涉到美元的威信、对美国经济趋势的怀疑。”“纽约时报”说，这是对美国的又“一个危险的讯号”。
    面对着这种种险恶迹象，甚至美国资产阶级报刊和经济学家也愈来愈多地认为，不论美国政府采取什么措施都无法逃脱一场新的“严重的经济衰退”。被认为是美国重要资产阶级经济学家之一的纽约詹韦研究公司总经理詹韦，最近在纽约指出，“今天的经济下降会发展为明天的暴跌”。他说，“下届总统——不论共和党人或民主党人——都将继承一个严重的衰退。”
