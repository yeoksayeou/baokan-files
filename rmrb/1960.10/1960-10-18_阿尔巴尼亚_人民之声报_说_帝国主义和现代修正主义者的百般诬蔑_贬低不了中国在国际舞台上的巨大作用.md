Albania's "Voice of the People" Says
No Amount of Slander from Imperialists and Modern Revisionists Can Diminish China's Enormous Role on the International Stage

The Albanian newspaper "Voice of the People" published an editorial on October 1st entitled "To the Great and Talented Chinese People, Fraternal Greetings," stating that the founding of the People's Republic of China, from an international perspective, was the greatest event since the victory of the October Socialist Revolution. It dealt a devastating blow to imperialism and colonialism, shifting the balance of power further in favor of peace and socialism.

The editorial then pointed out: The victory of the great Chinese people's revolution was achieved by the Chinese people through a long and arduous struggle under the wise and far-sighted leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the beloved son of the people and a long-tested Marxist-Leninist.

After specifically introducing China's construction achievements, the editorial pointed out: "These victories vividly demonstrate that the Chinese Communist Party's line, based on the Leninist principles of socialist construction, is correct and is a Marxist-Leninist line. The policy of rapidly transforming China into a socialist power with modernized industry, modernized agriculture, and modernized science and culture is being successfully realized. These achievements are possible because of the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes."

The editorial said that China's great socialist transformation and its enormous contribution to the struggle for peace have enhanced its prestige as a great peace-loving socialist country in the world. The reality of life proves that China has been making and continues to make outstanding contributions to eliminating the danger of a new war and to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. Peace-loving countries especially value the People's Republic of China's enormous contribution to extinguishing the flames of war ignited by colonialists and imperialists in countries such as Korea. The People's Republic of China's peaceful initiative on the signing of a mutual non-aggression pact by Asian and Pacific coastal countries and making the region a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and the People's Republic of China's support for all initiatives conducive to easing international tensions—all these clearly demonstrate China's peaceful policy. The People's Republic of China resolutely implements the well-known Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and has established and maintained friendly relations with a series of countries with different social systems. The People's Republic of China is one of the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

The editorial said that the Albanian people have consistently demanded the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. The editorial sternly condemned the shameful act of US imperialism in excluding the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China while allowing the political corpse of Chiang Kai-shek to usurp the seat of the People's Republic of China.

The editorial pointed out that US imperialists, in their dirty activities against the Chinese people, have also used their agents, the Yugoslav Tito clique, who have tried every possible means to slander the People's Republic of China. However, no slander from imperialists and modern revisionists can diminish the People's Republic of China's enormous role on the international stage or hinder the enhancement and consolidation of its international prestige.

The editorial also said that the Albanian people have an eternal and unbreakable friendship with the great Chinese people. As members of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the people of our two countries are fighting to further consolidate the unity of the socialist camp, smashing all the conspiracies of imperialism and modern revisionism that attempt to split and undermine this unity.

### 阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”说  帝国主义和现代修正主义者的百般诬蔑  贬低不了中国在国际舞台上的巨大作用

    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”说
    帝国主义和现代修正主义者的百般诬蔑
    贬低不了中国在国际舞台上的巨大作用
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”10月1日以“向伟大的天才的中国人民致兄弟般的敬礼”为题发表社论说，中华人民共和国的成立从国际意义上来说，是十月社会主义革命胜利以后最伟大的事件。它给了帝国主义和殖民主义以毁灭性的打击，使力量对比更加有利于和平和社会主义。
    社论接着指出：中国伟大人民革命的胜利是中国人民在以人民亲爱的儿子、久经考验的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党英明和卓有远见的领导下，经过长期艰巨的斗争而取得的。
    社论在具体介绍了中国建设成就后指出：“这些胜利生动地证明了中国共产党以列宁主义的社会主义建设原则为基础的路线，是正确的，是马克思列宁主义的路线。关于使中国迅速变为具有现代化工业、现代化农业和现代化科学文化的社会主义大国的这样一个方针，正在成功地实现着。这些成就之所以可能，是由于有了党所制定的总路线、大跃进和人民公社。”
    社论说，中国的伟大社会主义变革及其对争取和平的斗争所作的巨大贡献，提高了它作为世界上伟大爱好和平的社会主义国家的威信。生活的实际证明，中国对消除新战争的危险、对维护和巩固亚洲和世界和平的斗争作出了、并继续作出卓越的贡献。爱好和平的各国人民尤其重视人民中国在扑灭由殖民者和帝国主义者在朝鲜等国所燃起的战火的斗争中所作出的巨大贡献。中华人民共和国关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国签订互不侵犯公约、并使这个地区成为无核子武器地区的和平倡议，中华人民共和国对一切有利于缓和国际紧张局势的倡议的支持——这些都清楚地证明了中国的和平政策。中华人民共和国坚决执行众所周知的和平共处原则，同一系列不同社会制度的国家建立了并保持着友好的关系。中华人民共和国是和平共处五项原则首创者之一。
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民一贯要求恢复人民中国在联合国的合法代表权。社论严词谴责了美帝国主义排斥中华人民共和国合法代表，而使蒋介石政治僵尸窃据人民中国席位的可耻勾当。
    社论指出，美帝国主义者在其反对中国人民的肮脏活动中还动用了他们的代理人南斯拉夫铁托集团，这个修正主义集团千方百计地诬蔑人民中国。但是，帝国主义和现代修正主义者的任何诬蔑都贬低不了人民中国在国际舞台上的巨大作用，阻挠不了它的国际威信的提高和巩固。
    社论又说，阿尔巴尼亚人民同伟大的中国人民有着永恒的、牢不可破的友谊。作为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的成员，我们两国人民正在为进一步巩固社会主义阵营的团结而斗争，粉碎着力图分裂和破坏这种团结的帝国主义和现代修正主义的一切阴谋。
