Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The full text of Premier Abbas Ferhat's farewell speech at the Capital Airport is as follows:

Your Excellency,

As our delegation leaves Chinese soil, I would like to express our gratitude for the warm and friendly reception and generous hospitality you have extended to us.

Throughout our visit, your government has continuously expressed its warm concern for the struggle of the Algerian people, despite your heavy workload. Premier himself, as well as outstanding members of your government, have spared valuable time to meet with us and study issues of common concern, particularly the Algerian question.

The delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria is deeply moved by the warm reception of your government and people. We will convey to the Algerian people the heartfelt wishes of the Chinese people for solidarity, and we will tell them that the Chinese people are determined to increasingly support their struggle for independence.

Your Excellency,

Please convey to Chairman Mao Zedong the Algerian people's respect. His 22-year struggle for the liberation of 650 million people is the most beneficial lesson for the colonial peoples.

Please accept here the sincere gratitude of the members of your government.

We return home with the conviction that the People's Republic of China stands firmly on the side of the Algerian people, against imperialism, and will continue to support the Algerian people materially and morally until independence is achieved.

I also express my gratitude to the Chinese people, especially the people of the Chinese capital. Their enthusiastic cheers demonstrate their warm friendship for the Algerian people who are fighting against colonial oppression.

We have seen the Chinese people at work, and we admire them. They are experimenting, they are transforming, they are building, and they have great ambitions.

The concept of a superior race, the concept of man exploiting man, the concept of racial domination – these concepts, which once served as the foundation for establishing colonialism, are false and deceptive. These concepts are merely used to cover up a selfish and profit-seeking policy. When all forms of colonialism are eliminated from the earth, peaceful cooperation will be established throughout the world.

Tomorrow, these kinds of concepts will disappear along with imperialism. People and individuals will live and work in peace and contentment on an equal footing.

At present, French imperialism, with the support of the United States and NATO countries, is imposing a cruel, unjust, and futile war on the Algerian people. In any case, Algeria is determined to fight, and with the support of Arab brother countries, African and Asian countries, and mainly China, it will surely gain freedom and take its place in the family of independent nations.

History will not go backwards; the era of colonialism is over.

We will tell the Algerian people everything the Chinese people have done for us and will do for us. We will tell them that 650 million Chinese people now support their struggle for liberation, and will support it more and more effectively in the future, until the dying French imperialism helplessly recognizes our right to manage our own affairs and our right to control our own destiny.

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the unity and friendship between the Chinese and Algerian peoples!

Long live peaceful cooperation between the people of all countries!

Long live peace!

    在北京机场上
    阿巴斯总理的讲话
    新华社6日讯　阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理在首都机场上的告别讲话，全文如下：阁下：
    当我们的代表团离开中国土地的时候，我谨对你们所给予我们的热情友好的接待和盛情的款待表示感谢。
    在我们整个访问期间，贵国政府不断向我们热情地表示它对阿尔及利亚人民所进行的斗争的关怀，尽管你们工作繁重，但是总理先生本人以及贵国政府杰出的成员都不惜花费宝贵的时间接见我们，同我们一起研究我们共同关心的问题，特别是阿尔及利亚问题。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团对贵国政府和贵国人民的热烈接待甚为感动。我们将向阿尔及利亚人民转达中国人民热情团结的心愿，我们将告诉他们，中国人民决心与日俱增地支持他们争取独立的斗争。阁下：
    请你们转达阿尔及利亚人民对毛泽东主席的崇敬。他为六亿五千万人民的解放而进行的二十二年的斗争乃是对殖民地人民的最有益的教导。
    请贵国政府的成员在这里接受我们的深切的谢意。
    我们带着这种信念回国，那就是：中华人民共和国坚定不移地站在阿尔及利亚人民方面，反对帝国主义，它将不断地在物质上和道义上支持阿尔及利亚人民直到取得独立为止。
    我也向中国人民、特别是中国首都的人民表示感谢。他们的热情欢呼表现了他们对正在为反对殖民压迫而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民的热烈的友谊。
    我们看到了中国人民在进行工作，我们对他们表示钦佩。他们在进行着试验，他们在变革，他们在建设，他们有着雄心壮志。
    优秀种族的观念，人剥削人的观念，种族统治的观念，这些曾经作为树立殖民主义的基础的观念是错误的，是骗人的。这些观念不过是用来掩盖一种自私自利和唯利是图的政策罢了。当一切形式的殖民制度从地球上被消灭以后，和平合作在全世界将会建立起来。
    明天，这类观念将同帝国主义一起消失。人民和个人将在平等地位上安居乐业。
    目前，法帝国主义在美国和北大西洋条约组织国家支持下，将一场残酷的、非正义的和徒劳的战争强加在阿尔及利亚人头上。无论如何，阿尔及利亚决心进行战斗，在阿拉伯兄弟国家，在非洲和亚洲国家主要是中国的支持下，它必将获得自由，并且在独立国家的大家庭中取得它的地位。
    历史不会倒退，殖民主义的时代已经结束了。
    我们要把中国人民为我们所做的一切以及将要为我们所做的一切告诉阿尔及利亚人民。我们要告诉他们，六亿五千万中国人民现在支持他们争取解放的斗争，今后将越来越有效地加以支持，直到垂死的法帝国主义无可奈何地承认我们自由管理自己事务的权利和我们掌握自己命运的权利为止。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民的团结友好万岁！
    各国人民之间的和平合作万岁！
    和平万岁！
