    The Tide of the Red River
    — Recording New Developments in the Agricultural Cooperativization Movement in Northern Vietnam
    Feng Jianwei
    From Lang Son in the north to the military demarcation line within Quang Tri province in the south, the rich and beautiful countryside of Northern Vietnam has experienced a historic change in the past two months. This is the vigorous development of the agricultural cooperativization movement on its past foundation. About 80% of the total farming households in the North have joined agricultural cooperatives, essentially realizing agricultural cooperativization in the North. From then on, the small-scale peasant economy that has lasted for thousands of years has been replaced by collective agricultural production, and the poor and backward life lived by generations of Northern Vietnamese farmers will disappear with the change of production organization.

    During the days when the agricultural cooperativization movement surged forward, this reporter visited the countryside of the Red River Delta, known as the granary of the North, and personally witnessed the joy and boiling life of Vietnamese farmers actively building cooperatives and engaging in collective labor.

    On the morning of October 7, our party of five set off from Hanoi, riding in a car towards Hai Duong province, facing the rising sun in the east. The jeep sped along the wide and flat asphalt road, flanked by interconnected rice fields as far as the eye could see. At this time, the early rice was being harvested, and the late rice was being irrigated and strengthened; the heavy rice ears swayed in the breeze, and a burst of fragrance floated in from the car window from time to time, refreshing the heart and lungs.

    In Hai Duong City, Comrade Shi Shan, the person in charge of the Rural Work Department of the Hai Duong Provincial Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, introduced to the reporter the development of agricultural cooperativization here. He said that the agricultural cooperatives in Hai Duong province, like other places in North Vietnam, have greatly developed in the past month or so. At present, more than 1,920 cooperatives have been built in the province, and the number of farmers joining the cooperatives accounts for more than 90% of the total number of farmers in the province. Because the vast majority of this development is the expansion of old cooperatives with new members, the average number of households per agricultural cooperative in the province has increased from 36 in the past to more than 90, with a maximum of more than 500. In areas with better conditions, large-scale advanced agricultural cooperatives with one township per cooperative or several townships per cooperative are also being piloted.

    When analyzing the reasons for this healthy development, Comrade Shi Shan said that this is mainly the result of the broad masses of farmers raising their socialist consciousness under the long-term education of the Party, and thus consciously and voluntarily establishing cooperatives. He told the reporter that in the past three years, the vast rural areas have conducted six relatively large-scale ideological education campaigns and two centralized ideological debates. Each education campaign was based on a large amount of facts that were seen by the farmers themselves, mobilizing everyone to compare the changes in rural production and living conditions after the revolution, and then launching ideological debates. In this way, not only did the broad masses of farmers recognize the superiority of agricultural cooperativization, but they could also associate and understand many profound truths. Comrade Shi Shan said that this kind of comparative debate is lively, vivid and exciting. Please think about it, before liberation, there were no literate people in the rural areas of Hai Duong province, no mosquito nets, and there was a famine every year during the season when the old crops were exhausted and the new crops were not yet ripe. It is unknown how many people were separated from their wives and children, and it is unknown how many people fled to other places; after the August Revolution, especially in recent years after the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, the same rural areas have become another appearance. Every village has culture, every household has mosquito nets, and everyone lives a warm and happy life; such a sharp comparison, when discussed at the debate, is truly heart-stirring! In many places, there were tears and laughter at the debate, and the farmers who were considered very backward in the past only became enlightened and determined to join the cooperatives after these debates.

    As the conversation was about to end, Comrade Shi Shan told the reporter that there is a "Patriotic Township" eight kilometers away from Hai Duong City, which can represent the general villages of Hai Duong province. He suggested that the reporter go there to see it.

    That afternoon, the reporter was invited to visit Patriotic Township. Patriotic Township began to pilot agricultural cooperatives in 1958, and has now built a total of nine elementary agricultural cooperatives, with 100% of the farming households in the township who should have joined the cooperatives having joined. Among them, two cooperatives with a good foundation are preparing to be transformed into advanced agricultural cooperatives. When the reporter arrived, a cadre meeting was being held there to study the problems in establishing cooperatives. Comrade Huang Wenshu, the secretary of the township Party branch, and Comrade Nguyen Van Truong, the director of the Wu Shang Village Agricultural Cooperative, came out of the meeting room to warmly receive us. Comrade Huang Wenshu told us that this development mainly solves the problem of middle peasants joining the cooperatives. In the past, they relied on strong people and horses and good land to insist on working individually, and even secretly competed with agricultural cooperatives; however, after the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, each fen (Vietnamese acre) yielded 13 kilograms more rice than in the past. Raising fish and pigs, which even middle peasants could not do in the past, was achieved after organizing, and the cooperative also engaged in various sideline productions. In addition, the cooperative also specially planted early-maturing rice to help members with insufficient food and solve the problem of famine during the season when the old crops were exhausted and the new crops were not yet ripe. All of this was originally unimaginable to the upper-middle peasants. Before this development, everyone deeply studied the Party's policies, launched ideological debates, gradually clarified their understanding, and began to ask to join the cooperatives, and some automatically participated in advanced cooperatives. When the reporter visited the home of Comrade Gen, an upper-middle peasant who had recently joined the cooperative, he was participating in collective labor with the members. When the reporter asked him to talk about his feelings after joining the cooperative, he said without hesitation, "Agricultural cooperatives have a future, can increase production and live a good life, why wouldn't I want to participate?" The visit to Patriotic Township lasted until sunset. Before leaving, the members and cadres invited the reporter to come again during the autumn harvest to see the results of the advanced cooperative. It seems that the broad masses of members and cadres are full of confidence in running agricultural cooperatives well.

    Returning from the countryside, the reporter read the relevant materials on agricultural cooperatives in various places. According to the materials, the development of agricultural cooperatives in Northern Vietnam is first of all due to the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government strengthening their leadership over agricultural cooperatives. Before the start of the movement, leading organs at all levels held special meetings to seriously study the movement's direction, steps and targets. During the movement, the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party convened representatives from various provinces to exchange experiences on the issue of training and improving leading cadres of agricultural cooperatives and formulated a training plan; according to the spirit of this meeting, various places held a large number of agricultural cooperative study classes, successively training more than 300,000 leading cadres of agricultural cooperatives, and launched a "Four Goods" (good unity, good production, good management, good implementation of policies) competition to strive for the rapid development of expansion and the construction of new cooperatives. Second, the widespread establishment of elementary cooperatives in the past has trained leading backbones, accumulated experience in running cooperatives, and educated the broad masses of farmers with concrete examples, creating favorable conditions for this rapid and healthy development. Also, because there is a foundation for widespread cooperative establishment, the development of various types of regions this time is relatively balanced. Even the mountainous areas, which have always been sparsely populated and developing slowly, have caught up this time, and many regions have caught up with the plains and midstream regions. Third, insist on in-depth and meticulous ideological education work, gradually improve the socialist ideological awareness of the broad masses of farmers, achieve voluntary cooperative membership, and the broad masses of members have good thoughts and high morale. Fourth, the establishment of cooperatives is combined with the expansion of production, so that members can orderly invest in collective production as soon as they join the cooperatives, everyone's mood is stable, and everyone feels hopeful and promising. During the period of cooperative establishment, all places completed the sowing plans for late rice, miscellaneous grains and cash crops in a timely manner, and generally expanded the planting area by expanding the replanting area and reclaiming wasteland, and advanced the accumulation of fertilizers, the selection of fine seeds, the improvement of agricultural tools and the construction of water conservancy projects, striving to greatly increase the yield per unit area next year. At the same time, sideline productions such as animal husbandry and fish farming have also seen new developments.

    The agricultural cooperativization movement in Northern Vietnam has a long historical foundation. As early as during the Anti-French War, the rural areas of the North, in order to adapt to the needs of the two major tasks of heavy production and supporting the front, universally launched simple and easy-to-implement production groups, labor combination groups, small peasant groups and labor exchange and mutual aid groups, relying on collective strength, maintained and restored agricultural production at that time in extremely difficult circumstances, and made great contributions to the cause of national liberation. In 1955, with the restoration and development of production, some mutual aid groups began to be transformed into agricultural cooperatives. By the summer of this year, more than 45% of the farmers in the entire Northern rural area had joined cooperatives. Whether in mountainous areas or plains, whether in agricultural areas or fishing areas, as soon as a cooperative is established, it immediately shows its unique superiority. It has overcome the serious natural and man-made disasters - the poverty and hunger caused by the burning, killing and looting of the French imperialists; later, from 1958 to 1960, there were varying degrees of drought, flood and cold waves every year. However, thousands of disasters and difficulties not only did not curb the development of agricultural cooperativization, on the contrary, agricultural cooperatives were born in difficult times, and grew stronger and stronger in overcoming difficulties, and the more they were tested by difficulties, the more they showed their superiority, and the more they were welcomed by the broad masses of farmers.

    Now, except for a few areas in Northern Vietnam that have not reached the original development targets and are still continuing to develop, they are generally turning to consolidation in conjunction with current production activities. At the same time, advanced agricultural cooperatives of a socialist nature are being piloted in rural areas with better conditions in order to accumulate experience and prepare for the universal transformation into advanced cooperatives in the future, and to guide the current agricultural cooperatives in a new direction. It can be foreseen that the agricultural cooperatives in Northern Vietnam, which have been strictly tested, have made contributions to the restoration and development of agricultural production in the past, and will certainly exert greater power and show greater superiority in the future socialist construction of the North.

    红河的浪潮
    ——记越南北方农业合作化运动的新发展
    冯建伟
    北起谅山，南到广治省境内的军事分界线，越南北方富饶美丽的农村，在最近两个月来经历了一次具有历史意义的变化，这就是农业合作化运动在过去的基础上有了蓬勃发展，约占北方总农户80％的农民加入了农业合作社，使北方基本实现农业合作化；从此，延续了千百年的小农经济，已被集体的农业生产所代替，北方农民世世代代过的贫困落后的生活将随着生产组织的改变而一去不复返。
    在农业合作化运动风起云涌般地发展的日子里，记者曾访问了向称北方粮仓——富饶的红河三角洲的农村，亲自看到越南农民积极建社和集体劳动的喜悦心情和沸腾的生活。
    10月7日早晨，我们一行五人从河内出发，迎着东升的旭日乘车到海阳省去。吉普车疾驰在宽敞平坦的柏油马路上，马路两旁是阡陌相连的稻田，一望无际。这时，早稻正在收割，晚稻正灌浆壮籽；沉甸甸的稻穗在微风中摇曳，不时从车窗飘来阵阵清香，沁人心肺。
    在海阳市，越南劳动党海阳省委农村工作部负责人石山同志，给记者介绍了这里的农业合作化的发展情况。他说，海阳省的农业合作社，和越北其他地方一样，在最近一个多月来有很大的发展，全省目前共建成一千九百二十多个社，入社农户占到全省总农户的90％以上。由于这次发展绝大部分是老社扩展新社员，因此，全省农业合作社由过去平均每社三十六户，发展到平均每社九十多户，最多达五百户以上，在条件较好的地区还试办一乡一社或数乡一社的大型高级农业合作社。
    石山同志在分析这次健康发展的原因时说，这主要是广大农民在党的长期教育下提高了社会主义觉悟，因而自觉自愿办社的结果。他对记者说，最近三年以来，广大农村曾进行了六次规模较大的思想教育和两次集中的思想辩论，每次教育都根据大量的而且都是农民亲眼看见的事实，发动大家作革命后农村生产和生活情况变化的对比，然后展开思想辩论。这样，不仅使广大农民认清农业合作化的优越性，而且可以联想体会出很多含义深刻的道理。石山同志说，这种对比辩论生动活泼而且激动人心。请想想看，解放前，海阳省的农村没有识字的人，没有蚊帐，每年都有青黄不接的饥荒，不知有多少人妻离子散，不知有多少人逃亡他乡；八月革命以后，特别是最近几年建立了农业合作社，同样的农村，却变为另一个样子，村村有文化，家家有蚊帐，人人过着温饱而幸福的生活；这样尖锐的对比，在辩论会上谈论起来，真是震人心弦！许多地方的辩论会，有眼泪，也有欢笑，而过去被认为很落后的农民，就是经过这些辩论，思想上才豁然开朗和坚定了入社决心的。
    谈话快结束的时候，石山同志对记者说，离海阳市八公里有一个爱国乡，可以代表海阳省的一般村庄。他建议记者去那里看看。
    这天下午，记者应邀访问了爱国乡。爱国乡从1958年开始试办农业合作社，到现在共建成九个初级农业合作社，全乡应该入社的农户百分之百的入了社。其中，有两个基础好的社，正酝酿转建为高级农业合作社。记者到达时，那里正举行干部会议，研究建社中的问题。乡党支部书记黄文书同志和武上村农业合作社主任阮文丈同志，从会议室出来热情地接待我们。黄文书同志告诉我们，这次发展主要是解决中农入社的问题。他们过去凭仗人强马壮土地好，坚持单干，甚至暗地和农业合作社比赛；但是，农业合作社成立后，每分田（越亩）比过去多收十三公斤稻谷。过去连中农也无法作到的养鱼、养猪，组织起来后作到了，社里还搞了多种副业生产。另外，社里还特地种植了早熟稻，接济食粮不足的社员，解决了青黄不接的饥荒问题，这一切都是上中农原来想像不到的。这次发展前，大家深入学习了党的政策，展开思想辩论，认识逐渐明确，开始要求入社，有些自动参加高级社。记者访问新入社的上中农根同志的家庭时，他正同社员一起参加集体劳动，记者请他谈谈入社后的感想，他不假思索地说，农业合作社有前途，能增产过好日子，我为什么不愿意参加呢？在爱国乡的访问直到夕阳西下。临别时，社员和干部们邀记者秋收时再来，看看高级社的成绩。看样子，广大社员和干部对办好农业合作社满怀信心。
    从乡村回来，记者翻阅了有关各地农业合作社的材料，根据材料表明，越南北方农业合作社的发展，首先是越南劳动党和政府加强了对农业合作社的领导。运动开始前，各级领导机关都举行了专门会议，认真研究了运动的方针、步骤和指标。运动中，越南劳动党中央农村工作部曾召集各省代表，就培养和提高农业合作社领导干部的问题交流经验，订出培养计划；根据这次会议精神，各地举办大量农业合作社学习班，先后训练农业合作社领导干部达三十多万人，并且开展了“四好”（团结好、生产好、管理好、执行政策好）的竞赛运动，以争取扩建和新建社迅速走上轨道。第二，由于过去普遍建立初级社，锻炼了领导骨干，积累了办社经验，并且以具体的榜样教育了广大农民，为这次迅速而健康发展创造有利条件。还由于有了普遍办社的基础，这次各类地区的发展比较平衡，连一向居住分散发展缓慢的山区，这次也急起直追，很多地区赶上了平原和中游地区。第三，坚持深入细致的思想教育工作，逐步提高广大农民的社会主义思想觉悟，作到入社自愿，广大社员思想好，情绪高。第四，建社结合扩大生产，使社员一入社就有秩序地投入集体生产，人人情绪安定，人人感觉有希望有奔头。各地建社期间，都及时完成晚稻、杂粮和经济作物播种计划，一般都以扩大复种面积和开垦荒地来扩展种植面积，并且提前增积肥料，精选良种、改良农具和兴修水利，争取明年大大提高单位面积的产量。同时，畜牧和养鱼等副业生产也有新的发展。
    越南北方的农业合作化运动有很久的历史基础。早在抗法战争期间，北方农村适应当时繁重的生产和支前两大任务的需要，普遍兴起简便易行的生产小组、合工组、小农团和变工互助组，依靠集体的力量，在极端困难的情况下，维持和恢复了当时的农业生产，对祖国解放事业作出巨大贡献。1955年，随着生产的恢复和发展，有些互助组开始转建为农业合作社。到今年夏季，整个北方农村已有45％多的农户入了社。不论山区和平原，不论农业区和渔业区，合作社一经成立，就立刻显示出特异的优越性。它曾经战胜了严重的天灾人祸——法帝国主义者烧杀掠夺而造成的贫困和饥饿；后来，从1958年到1960年，每年都有程度不等的旱、涝和寒潮的危害。但是，千灾万难，不仅没有遏止农业合作化的发展，相反的，农业合作社在困难的时日诞生，又在战胜困难中成长壮大起来，而且越是经过困难的考验，就越显示出它的优越性，就越受广大农民所欢迎。
    现在，越南北方农村除少数未达到原订发展指标的地区仍在继续发展外，正结合当前生产活动，普遍转向巩固。同时，在条件较好的农村开始试办社会主义性质的高级农业合作社，以便积累经验，为今后普遍转建高级社，为把现在的农业合作社引向新的方向作好准备。可以预见，经过严格考验的越南北方的农业合作社，在过去对恢复和发展农业生产作出贡献，在今后北方的社会主义建设中也一定会发挥更大的威力，显示更大的优越性。
