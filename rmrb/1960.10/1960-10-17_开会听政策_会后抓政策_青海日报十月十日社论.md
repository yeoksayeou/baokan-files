*Qinghai Daily* Editorial, October 10

"Listen to policies in meetings, the more you listen, the more motivated you become. Only when you understand the policies can things be done well." This is a saying from Zhang Bingwei, the Party Branch Secretary of Dujiazhuang Production Team in Zongzhai Commune, Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province. This saying is very good and has great significance for all our grassroots cadres.

Chairman Mao said: "Being good at turning the Party's policies into the actions of the masses, being good at making every movement and every struggle understood and mastered not only by the leading cadres but also by the broad masses, this is a Marxist-Leninist art of leadership." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, page 1318) A grassroots cadre is a commander, and if you want to command production struggles well, you must pay attention to the art of leadership. Zhang Bingwei's understanding of the importance of listening to policies in meetings shows that he truly understands the great power of policies. Therefore, he can work hard to study policies, publicize policies, and take the lead in implementing policies, which has led to great achievements in his work. This year, although Dujiazhuang Production Team suffered natural disasters of summer drought and autumn hail, the total output still exceeded last year, which is the best proof.

Why do the Party's policies have such great power? This is because our Party's policies are the correct conclusions drawn from a thorough investigation and study of the realities of the Chinese revolution and construction, using the theory and method of Marxism-Leninism. It is using the arrow of Marxism-Leninism to shoot the target of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, policy is the soul and lifeline of all work. Any work that deviates from the Party's policy will inevitably suffer setbacks and failures. Zhang Bingwei and the cadres of Dujiazhuang recognized this truth, so they listen to policies in meetings and grasp policies after meetings, and policies always come first in their work. When the masses understand the policies, they immediately take action, twist into a rope with the cadres, and carry out all work vigorously and solidly.

To master policies well, cadres must first study policies well. "Listening to policies in meetings" is an important aspect of studying policies well. In the past, some grassroots cadres attended meetings and listened more to numbers (plans arranged by higher levels) and less to policies. Listening to numbers is certainly correct, but if they listen less to policies, they lack a clear direction and准则 when they work, and the tasks are often not completed well. Now, when grassroots cadres attend meetings, they listen to tasks and also listen to policies, understand the spirit of the policies, and act according to the policies. The work has been carried out smoothly, and the tasks have been successfully completed. This is an improvement in the leadership level of our grassroots cadres and a fundamental guarantee for completing various tasks.

As for the leading organs, Chairman Mao pointed out long ago that their basic tasks lie in understanding the situation and grasping the two major issues of policy. When policies are handed down and mastered by the masses, and when situations are reported and mastered by the leaders, our work can be done deeply, meticulously, and practically. Therefore, when the leading organs arrange a task, they must explain the guiding principles and policies for completing the task. If the leading organs speak clearly, the grassroots cadres can listen clearly. The combination of "speaking policies" and "listening to policies" is true between the leading organs and the grassroots cadres, and the same is true between the grassroots cadres and the broad masses. Only when the Party's policies truly become the conscious actions of the broad masses can great material strength be generated.

### 开会听政策　会后抓政策  青海日报十月十日社论

    开会听政策　会后抓政策
    青海日报十月十日社论
    “开会听政策，越听越有劲，政策弄明白，事情才好办。”这是青海省湟中县总寨公社杜家庄生产队党支部书记张秉伟说的一句话。这句话说得很好，对我们所有的基层干部都很有意义。
    毛主席说：“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷一三一八页）一个基层干部，就是一个指挥员，要想指挥好生产斗争，领导艺术是不能不讲求的。张秉伟体会到开会听政策的重要，说明他真正懂得了政策的巨大威力，因而他能努力学习政策，宣传政策，带头执行政策，使工作取得了很大成绩。杜家庄生产队今年虽然遭受了夏旱秋雹的自然灾害，但是总产量仍然超过去年，这就是最好的证明。
    为什么党的政策有巨大的威力呢？这是因为我们党的政策，是应用马克思列宁主义的理论和方法，对中国革命和建设实际，作周密的调查研究之后，所得出的指导革命和建设的正确结论，是用马克思列宁主义之矢，射中国革命之的。所以政策是一切工作的灵魂和生命线。任何工作脱离了党的政策，必然遭到挫折和失败。张秉伟和杜家庄的干部认识了这个真理，所以会上听政策，会后抓政策，在工作中总是政策先行。当群众懂得了政策之后，就立即行动起来，与干部拧成一股绳，把各项工作都搞得轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实。
    干部要掌握好政策，首先必须学好政策。“开会听政策”，就是学好政策的一个重要方面。过去，有些基层干部参加会议，听数字（上级布置的计划）多，听政策少。听数字当然是对的，但政策听得少，工作起来就缺乏明确的方向和准则，任务也往往完成得不好；现在，基层干部参加会议，听任务，又听政策，领会了政策精神，按政策办事，工作顺利地开展了，任务也胜利地完成了。这就是我们基层干部领导水平的提高，也是完成各项任务的根本保证。
    至于领导机关，毛主席早就指出，它的基本任务在于了解情况和掌握政策两件大事。政策交下去，为群众所掌握；情况上来了，为领导所掌握，我们的工作才能作到深、细、实。所以，领导机关在布置一项任务的同时，必须交代完成这项任务的方针政策。领导机关讲得清清楚楚，基层干部才能听得明明白白。要把“讲政策”与“听政策”结合起来，领导机关与基层干部之间是如此，基层干部与广大群众之间，同样也是如此。要真正使党的政策成为广大群众的自觉行动，才能产生伟大的物质力量。
