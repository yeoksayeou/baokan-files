Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 21st: Hubei is planting summer harvest crops in paddy field areas, striving for an additional harvest of grain next year. To date, the province has sown over 20 million mu of summer harvest crops such as barley, wheat, and rapeseed, with sowing quality generally meeting requirements.

Hubei's rice-growing areas have traditionally planted very few summer harvest crops. Many paddy fields only yield one or two harvests of rice per year. This farming habit has changed somewhat in the past year, but the area of summer harvest crops still only accounts for 30% to 40% of the cultivated land. This year, to further change this habit and fully utilize the land's potential, various regions conducted debates by summarizing typical experiences before autumn planting, changing the perception that "paddy fields cannot grow wheat" and expanding the planting of summer harvest crops.

Hubei has a mild climate, fertile soil, and a short freezing period. According to past experience, there are fewer natural disasters during the growing season of summer harvest crops, and yields have been relatively stable. However, some rice-growing areas have many rivers and lakes, abundant spring rains, and high groundwater levels, which are detrimental to the normal growth of summer harvest crops. Therefore, these areas have paid special attention to taking measures to solve these practical problems during this year's autumn planting. Honghu, Mianyang, and other counties with many lakes and rivers have vigorously reformed the drainage systems of paddy fields planted with summer harvest crops this year. Some communes, after the drainage reform of paddy fields, can basically ensure that the fields are dry after the rain stops. Leading cadres in many counties of the Huanggang region went deep into the fields to survey together with commune members, taking measures such as opening canals, digging ditches, and applying more warm fertilizer to transform the rotten mud fields. Hongan County alone has transformed more than 40,000 mu of rotten mud fields, thus expanding the area of summer harvest crops.

This newspaper, Kunming, October 21st: Party committees at all levels in Yunnan Province are firmly grasping the current autumn harvest and autumn planting, ensuring the timely harvesting of major spring crops and returning the grains to the granary; and also sowing as they harvest, striving to plant more and plant well minor spring crops. At present, the province has harvested nearly 50% of the major spring crops, with the daily progress increasing by more than 70% compared to the end of last month; at the same time, more than 6 million mu of minor spring crops have been sown.

This year, in accordance with the principle of "combining multiple planting and multiple harvesting with high yield and multiple harvesting," the people of all ethnic groups in the province have planted major spring crops more abundantly and better, and the minor spring planting area arranged by various regions has been expanded compared to the same period last year. Therefore, this year's autumn harvest and autumn planting tasks are more arduous than in any previous year. In order to do a good job in autumn harvest and autumn planting, party secretaries at all levels have personally taken command, and the main leading cadres are responsible for specific areas and go deep into the front line of production; at the same time, a large number of cadres have been organized to go down to the grass-roots production units to directly serve as team leaders, so that the leading forces on the front line have been universally strengthened. Most of the party and government organs at the prefectural, county, and commune levels, except for a few people who stay to maintain daily work, have all gone to the countryside and fields to participate in the rush harvest and rush planting. Due to the strengthening of leadership, the daily progress of harvesting and planting in Baoshan, Changning, Tengchong and other counties in Dehong Autonomous Prefecture has increased from more than 30,000 mu to more than 60,000 mu.

While concentrating leading forces, party committees at all levels have also concentrated labor forces from all aspects to replenish the autumn harvest and autumn planting teams. According to statistics from Zhaotong and Yuxi prefectures and Honghe, Dali, Dehong and other autonomous prefectures, the labor force currently invested in autumn harvest and autumn planting in these areas accounts for about 80% of the existing labor force in rural areas. During the high tide of autumn harvest and autumn planting, all walks of life in the province have also drawn out all available manpower and material resources to support it.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 21st: Under the impetus of the idea of vigorously developing agriculture and grain, people's communes in various parts of Liaoning Province have completed the winter wheat sowing work more abundantly, quickly, and well. Not only has the Dalian area, which grows the most winter wheat, expanded its winter wheat area again this year compared with last year, but also the twelve counties along the Liao River, such as Liaozhong, Tai'an, Panshan, and Xinmin, which have rarely sown winter wheat, have sown more than 56,000 mu of winter wheat this year. In the Dalian area, which was the earliest to sow, the wheat seedlings are already four or five inches high and generally growing well.

This year, in response to the Party's call for multiple planting of winter wheat, various regions have universally strengthened the leadership of autumn planting work. In order to complete the winter wheat expansion plan more abundantly and better in a timely manner, Party organizations at all levels in the Dalian area took the lead by secretaries at all levels, and organized a 200,000-strong wheat planting team in early September, plowing and sowing earlier than in previous years, and victoriously completed the sowing work in about 20 days. The people's communes in the counties in the Liao River basin also universally combined autumn harvest and organized specialized wheat planting teams, seizing every minute and second to rush sow winter wheat.

Conscientiously implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and striving to plant every mu of winter wheat well is the outstanding feature of winter wheat sowing in various parts of Liaoning this year. The vast majority of people's communes in the Dalian area plant winter wheat on fertile land with water sources. Every piece of land has been deeply plowed and finely harrowed to ensure that the cultivated land is level and the fertilization is sufficient. Good seeds are selected, small ridges are promoted, and wide-row strip sowing is adopted to achieve rational close planting. The Dongjiagou People's Commune in Jin County, which has achieved large-scale high yields of winter wheat for many years, basically met the requirements of garden-style cultivation in the 7,500 mu of winter wheat sown this year. Every mu of terraced fields was sown, and self-flowing irrigation accounted for 80%.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, October 20th: The winter wheat sowing work in Qinghai Province has basically ended, and the sowing area has doubled compared to last year. According to statistics from the nine counties and cities, including Xining, Minhe, Ledu, Guide, and Jianzha, where winter wheat is sown more frequently, the sowing area of winter wheat this year has more than doubled compared to last year; Minhe County has expanded its planting by more than four times compared to last year, and Hualong Hui Autonomous County has expanded its planting by more than five times compared to last year.

Qinghai Province is one of China's major spring wheat producing areas. Since liberation, some areas have begun to grow winter wheat, and the sowing area has gradually expanded. Practice has proved that growing winter wheat here generally yields higher yields than spring wheat under the same conditions. Therefore, Qinghai has further expanded the sowing area of winter wheat this year, and the sowing quality is also better.

Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership of the winter wheat sowing work, and cadres at all levels have gone deep into the fields to carry manure, plow the land, and sow with the masses. Before sowing, various regions generally turned the stubble two or three times, basically meeting the requirements of deep, fine, and thorough; combined with turning the stubble, a lot of base fertilizer was applied; the seeds were all mixed with "666" powder; and the strip sowing method was adopted to achieve rational close planting, uniform seed placement, and appropriate depth. From the already emerged winter wheat leaves being oily green, the seedlings being uniform, and the seedlings being strong, it can be seen that winter wheat was sown timely and well this year.

    今年多秋播明年增夏粮
    湖北水田地区大种夏收作物　云南随收随种进度大大加快
    辽宁又多又快又好完成麦播　青海小麦播种面积成倍扩大
    据新华社武汉21日电　湖北各地在水田地区种植夏收作物，力争明年多收一季粮食。到目前为止，全省已播大麦、小麦、油菜等夏收作物两千多万亩，播种质量一般合乎要求。
    湖北水稻地区一向很少种植夏收作物。许多水田一年只收一季或两季水稻。最近一年来，这种耕作习惯有了改变，但夏收作物面积仍只占耕地面积的30％到40％。今年为了进一步改变这种耕作习惯，充分发挥土地潜力，各地早在秋种前就通过总结典型经验，开展辩论，改变了“水田不能种麦”的思想，扩大种植夏收作物。
    湖北气候温和，土质肥沃，封冻期短，根据历年经验，夏收作物生长期间自然灾害较少，产量一向比较稳定。但是部分水稻地区河流湖泊较多，春雨较多，地下水位较高，对夏收作物的正常生长不利。因此，这些地区今年秋种中特别注意采取措施解决这些实际问题。境内湖泊河流较多的洪湖、沔阳等县，今年对种植夏收作物的水田大力进行了沟厢改革。有的公社经过水田沟厢改革，基本上可以作到雨止田干。黄冈地区许多县的领导干部深入田间与社员一道勘察，采取开渠挖沟、多施暖肥等措施改造烂泥田。仅红安县改造的烂泥田就达四万多亩，因而扩大了夏收作物的面积。
    本报昆明21日电　云南省各级党委狠抓当前秋收、秋种，确保大春作物及时收割，颗粒归仓；并且随收随种，力争多种、种好小春作物。目前，全省已经收获大春作物近50％，日进度比上月底加快了70％以上；同时已播种小春作物六百多万亩。
    今年，全省各族人民根据“多种多收和高产多收相结合”的方针，大春作物种得又多又好，各地安排的小春播种面积都比去年同期扩大。因此，今年的秋收、秋种任务比过去任何一年更加繁重。为了做好秋收秋种工作，各级党委书记都亲自挂帅，主要领导干部分片包干，深入生产第一线；同时组织了大批干部下到基层生产单位，直接担任作业组长，使第一线上的领导力量普遍加强。许多地、县、公社三级党委机关除留下少数人坚持日常工作外，其余全部都下乡下田，投入抢收抢种。德宏自治州的保山、昌宁、腾冲等县由于加强了领导力量，收、种日进度由原来的三万多亩提高到六万多亩。
    在集中领导力量的同时，各级党委还从各方面集中劳动力充实秋收、秋种队伍。据昭通、玉溪专区和红河、大理、德宏等自治州统计，这些地区现已投入秋收、秋种的劳动力已占农村现有劳动力的80％左右。在秋收、秋种高潮中，全省各行各业还都抽调一切可以抽调的人力、物力加以支援。
    据新华社沈阳21日电　辽宁省各地人民公社在大办农业、大办粮食的思想推动下，又多又快又好地完成了冬麦播种工作。不仅种冬麦最多的旅大地区今年冬麦面积又比去年扩大，就是一向很少播种冬麦的辽河沿岸的辽中、台安、盘山、新民等十二个县，今年也播种了五万六千多亩冬麦。播种最早的旅大地区，麦苗已高四、五寸，普遍生长良好。
    今年各地响应党的多种冬麦的号召，普遍加强了秋种工作的领导。旅大地区各级党组织为了又多又好适时完成冬麦扩种计划，层层由书记挂帅，9月上旬便组织起二十万人的种麦队伍，比往年提早开犁播种，二十天左右就胜利完成了播种工作。辽河流域各县的人民公社也普遍结合秋收，组织种麦专业队伍，争分夺秒地抢种冬麦。
    认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”，力争冬麦亩亩种好，是今年辽宁各地播种冬麦中的突出特点。旅大地区各人民公社绝大部分都把冬麦种在有水源的肥沃土地上，块块土地都经过深耕细耙，做到耕地平、施肥足，选用良种，推行小垅，宽幅条播，达到合理密植，连年冬麦大面积高产的金县董家沟人民公社，今年播种的七千五百亩冬麦基本上达到了园田化的要求，亩亩畦田播种，自流灌溉占80％。
    据新华社西宁20日电　青海省冬小麦播种工作已经基本结束，播种面积比去年成倍扩大。据西宁、民和、乐都、贵德、尖扎等播种冬麦较多的九个县市的统计，今年冬小麦的播种面积比去年扩大一倍以上；民和县比去年扩种四倍多，化隆回族自治县比去年扩种五倍多。
    青海省是我国主要春小麦产区之一。解放以来，一些地区开始种植冬小麦，播种面积逐年扩大。实践证明，这里种植冬小麦，产量一般比在同样条件下的春小麦要高。因此，今年青海各地进一步扩大了冬小麦播种面积，播种质量也较好。
    各地党委都加强了对冬小麦播种工作的领导，各级干部深入田间，与群众一起背粪、翻地、播种。各地在播种前普遍翻茬两三遍，基本达到了深、细、透的要求；结合翻茬，施了许多基肥；子种全部用“六六六”药粉拌过；并且采用条播的方法，做到了合理密植，下子均匀、深度适宜。从已经出苗的冬麦叶色油绿、苗齐、苗壮等情况可以看出，今年冬小麦播得适时、播得好。（附图片）
