Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th - According to the Korean Central News Agency, the Korean Military Armistice Commission held its 128th meeting this morning at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side.

At the meeting, Major General Zhu Changjun, chief member of the Korean-Chinese side, strongly protested and condemned the U.S. side's failure to fulfill the demands made by the Korean-Chinese side at the 124th meeting of the Military Armistice Commission on August 3. These demands were made in response to the provocative hostile actions of U.S. vessels intruding into the coastal waters of the Korean-Chinese side on July 30, including severely punishing all U.S. personnel involved in this provocative incident and reporting the results to the Military Armistice Commission. Major General Zhu Changjun condemned the U.S. side's deliberate failure to fulfill its obligations under the Korean Armistice Agreement, and he once again made strong demands to the U.S. side, pointing out that the U.S. side must fulfill all the demands that the Korean-Chinese side has already made and take responsible measures to ensure that similar provocative actions do not occur again.
