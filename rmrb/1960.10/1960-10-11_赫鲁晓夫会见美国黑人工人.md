    Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 10th (TASS): American Black workers Clark and Curtis met with Khrushchev at the Soviet government leader's residence on the morning of the 8th.
    During the conversation, the American Black workers told Khrushchev about the miserable plight of Black people in the United States. They said that Black people in the southern United States had not been able to defend their human rights. They had lost their jobs, become beggars, and become people without rights. Black people in the southern United States are now fighting for the right to vote, and this struggle is being waged under unequal conditions.
    Khrushchev replied that this was a truly terrible situation. He also pointed out that in the United States, on the one hand, there was a surplus of food, but on the other hand, there were thousands of Americans starving. The Black workers added that thousands of working people in the United States were living in abject poverty. Khrushchev agreed with this statement, saying that in the United States, indeed many rich people lived very well, but the lives of the poor who did manual labor were very bad. The Black workers told Khrushchev angrily that in the United States, manual laborers and Black people were almost the same thing.
    They said that Black people in the southern United States were pleased with the fraternal support of Soviet workers.
    Khrushchev emphasized that workers uniting was a great cause. The Soviet working people will always help their class brothers.

    赫鲁晓夫会见美国黑人工人
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：美国黑人工人克拉克和柯迪斯8日上午在苏联政府领导人的寓所会见了赫鲁晓夫。
    在交谈中，美国黑人工人向赫鲁晓夫谈到美国黑人的悲惨处境。他们说，美国南部的黑人没有能够保卫住自己的人权。他们失去了工作，成了乞丐，成了无权的人。现在美国南部的黑人正为争取选举权而斗争，这一斗争是在不平等的情况下进行的。
    赫鲁晓夫回答说，这是一种真正可怕的情况。他还指出，在美国，一方面粮食过剩，但另一方面却有成千上万的美国人在挨饿。黑人工人补充说，美国成千上万的劳动人民成为赤贫。赫鲁晓夫同意这种说法，他说，美国的确有许多富人生活过得很好，但是干粗活的穷人的生活却非常差。黑人工人愤怒地告诉赫鲁晓夫，在美国，干粗活的工人和黑人几乎是同一个概念。
    他们说，美国南部的黑人对苏联工人兄弟般的支持表示高兴。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，工人团结一致，这是一个伟大的事业。苏联劳动人民永远援助自己的阶级兄弟。
