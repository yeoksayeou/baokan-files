Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian, 20th – The Dalian Port Authority mobilized its employees to summarize various management systems and operating methods for ensuring transportation quality, and formulated a complete set of transportation quality management regulations for loading and unloading, and warehouse management, greatly promoting the improvement of cargo transportation quality.

Since the Eastern Loading and Unloading Area of Dalian Port began implementing the transportation quality management regulations in August, it has adhered to the pre-ship (vehicle) meeting system, explaining the warehouse, cargo types, and ship and vehicle allocation to the stevedores. Loading and unloading machinery is prepared before ships and vehicles arrive at the port. As a result, the number of cargo damage and shortage accidents in this area in August and September was greatly reduced compared to the monthly average of the previous seven months, and the loss of important materials such as grain and soda ash was reduced to a minimum. In order to strengthen warehouse management and reduce cargo damage and shortages, the Western Loading and Unloading Area has formulated covenants such as: clean vehicles, clean holds, clean warehouses, clean roads; broken bags are not taken out of the hold, not stacked, not loaded onto ships (vehicles); unclear markings, unknown cargo types are not taken out of the warehouse, not loaded onto ships (vehicles), and so on. Each loading and unloading team also organizes workers to participate in tallying and marking. Each loading and unloading area has established a repair team, and the stevedores carry needles, thread, brooms, and small sieves with them, repairing broken bags at any time, and cleaning up scattered grain and other materials at any time. The cargo discrepancies in each warehouse have also been greatly reduced.

Currently, all loading and unloading areas, teams, and work groups in the port are taking the implementation of the system as an important measure to realize the production increase and economy practice plan and are carrying out a high-quality and efficient transportation competition. Since October, due to the conscientious implementation of the grain loading and unloading operating procedures, each loading and unloading team in the Western Loading and Unloading Area has witnessed a new atmosphere of not a single grain being dropped and no damage to the bags.

The port also frequently consults with shipping units and fraternal ports to solicit their opinions and requirements for transportation quality, understand cargo transportation conditions, and revise and supplement quality management regulations in a timely manner to improve transportation quality.

    加强管理　改进操作　避免差错　减少损耗
    大连港大力提高运输质量
    西部装卸区作到装卸粮食粒米不丢
    新华社旅大20日电　大连港务局发动职工总结各项保证运输质量的管理制度和操作方法，制定成装卸和库场管理等一整套运输质量管理规程，大大促进了货运质量的提高。
    大连港的东部装卸区从8月份开始贯彻运输质量管理规程以来，坚持执行了船（车）前会议制度，向装卸工人交代库场、货种以及船、车配载情况，在船、车到港以前，就准备好装卸机具，因此，这个区8、9两个月份发生的货损，货差事故比前七个月每月发生的事故大大减少，粮食、纯碱等重要物资的损耗量，降低到了最小限度。西部装卸区为了加强库场管理，减少货损、货差，制订了公约，如车上净、舱内净、库场净、道路净；破包不出舱、不码垛、不装船（车），标志不清、货种不明不出库、不装船（车）等等。各个装卸队还组织工人参加理货、打标记。各个装卸区成立了包修组，装卸工人随身携带针线、扫帚和小筛子，发现破包随时修补，随时清理散落的粮食和其它物资。各库的货差也大大减少。
    目前，全港各装卸区、队、工班，都把执行制度作为实现增产节约计划的重要措施，开展优质高效运输竞赛。西部装卸区各个装卸小组，10月份以来，由于认真执行了装卸粮食操作规程，全区出现了粒米不掉，袋上不损的新气象。
    这个港还经常到发货单位和兄弟港口，征求他们对运输质量的意见和要求，了解货运情况，及时修改和补充质量管理规程，来提高运输质量。
