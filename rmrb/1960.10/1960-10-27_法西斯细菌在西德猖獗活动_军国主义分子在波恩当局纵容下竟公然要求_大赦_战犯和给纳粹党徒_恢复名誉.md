Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, October 25th: Fascist militarist organizations and ringleaders of West Germany's ruling party have recently openly clamored for "amnesty" for West German war criminals, and demanded so-called "reasonable treatment" for former Hitler "SS" armed personnel stained with blood.

According to a report today in the West German "Frankfurter Rundschau," the West German militarist organization "Support Association of Former 'SS' Armed Soldiers" met in Rendsburg, West Germany, on the 23rd. Lasner, Secretary-General of the Christian Democratic Union parliamentary group of the West German ruling party, spoke at the meeting, openly clamoring for "fair and reasonable treatment" for former "SS" members.

Former "SS" General Kurt Meyer complained that the families of his soldiers had not received "material supplies." He also expressed dissatisfaction with films exposing the crimes of the Nazi "SS."

The West German militarist organizations "German Soldiers' Association," "German Air Force Group," and "Association of Expellees" recently jointly wrote to the various parliamentary groups of the West German Federal Assembly, demanding "amnesty" for war criminals. They demanded that war criminals "no longer be held accountable" for crimes committed during the war, and demanded that all trials of criminals being prosecuted or already convicted be stopped or exempted from execution. Because they believe that "now is the time to stop this kind of punishment."

The organ of the West German "Association of Victims of Nazi Rule," the weekly "Aktion," recently pointed out that the reason why these fascist militarists believe that "the time has come" and dare to clamor wildly for "rehabilitation" is that the West German government's judicial authorities are "increasingly declaring war criminals innocent," and have placed "the vast majority of the command power of the 'West German Armed Forces' in the hands of former Hitler generals." "Aktion" weekly said that this has "greatly encouraged" the fascist militarists.

    法西斯细菌在西德猖獗活动
    军国主义分子在波恩当局纵容下竟公然要求“大赦”战犯和给纳粹党徒“恢复名誉”
    据新华社波恩25日电　西德执政党头子和法西斯军国主义组织最近公然叫嚷要“大赦”西德的战争罪犯，并要求给予满手血腥的前希特勒“党卫军”武装人员以所谓“合理的待遇”。
    据西德“法兰克福评论报”今天报道，西德军国主义组织“前‘党卫军’武装军人支援联合会”23日在西德伦茨堡集会。西德执政党基督教民主联盟联邦议会党团秘书长拉斯纳在会上讲话，公开叫嚷要对前“党卫军”队员给予“公平合理的待遇”。
    前“党卫军”将军库尔特·麦耶抱怨他的士兵的家属没有得到“物质上的供应”。他还对揭露纳粹“党卫军”罪行的影片表示不满。
    西德的“德国军人联合会”、“德国空军集团”、“归乡者联合会”等军国主义组织最近联名写信给西德联邦议会各党团，要求对战争罪犯实行“大赦”。他们要求对战犯在战争时期所犯的罪行“一律不再追究”，并要求对正在起诉的或已经判决的罪犯一律停止审讯或免予执行。因为他们认为“现在该是停止进行这种惩罚的时候了”。
    西德“受纳粹统治之害者协会”机关报“行动”周报最近指出，这些法西斯军国主义分子所以认为“时机已经到来”并敢于猖狂叫嚣要“恢复名誉”，是由于西德政府司法当局“愈来愈多的宣布战争罪犯无罪”，并且把“绝大部分的‘西德国防军’的指挥权力交到前希特勒将军手里”。“行动”周报说，这样就使法西斯军国主义分子“得到了很大的鼓舞”。
