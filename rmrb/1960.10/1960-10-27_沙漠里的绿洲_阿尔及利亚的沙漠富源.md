    Oasis in the Desert
    ——Algeria's Desert Resources
    Zhuge Wen
    In the heroic land of Algeria, a large area is desert, part of the world's largest Sahara Desert. People should not misunderstand that the desert is entirely a barren land of sand and gravel. This desert is also a treasure trove for the Algerian people, because its surface is dotted with star-like oases, and its underground contains endless rivers of oil.
    The ancient mountains that traverse central Algeria have been eroded into low hills and shallow mounds by thousands of years of wind and frost. In these piles of broken stones, gurgling springs emerge from the ground, nourishing the land and growing plants. We call this kind of place an oasis. The hardworking and intelligent Algerian people widely cultivate date palm trees in the oases, making them the representative trees of the Sahara Desert. The date palm tree has a straight trunk, about fifteen to twenty meters high, with long, feather-like compound leaves extending from the top of the tree, and ten or so fruit clusters hanging between the leaf stems, each fruit cluster containing dozens of strings of date palm fruits. The verdant foliage is dotted on the boundless yellow sand, which is a unique scenery. The exceptionally bright sunlight in the desert shines on the fruit peel, making it even more vivid and lovely. Speaking of date palm fruits, they are not unfamiliar to us either. They are the fruit of the same plant as Iraqi honey dates, only from different producing areas. Date palm fruit is juicy and sweet, and is an important food for oasis residents, as well as the main food for Muslims during and after Eid al-Fitr. Each date palm tree can bear 30 to 200 kilograms of fruit per year. Algerian farmers harvest a lot of food from the trees every year, so they cherish these small oases and call them "gardens of Allah."
    The oil of the Sahara Desert has only been discovered in large quantities in the last ten years. Although the underground secrets have not been fully revealed, according to the existing data, the oil reserves in the Sahara Desert probably rank second in the capitalist world, second only to the Middle East and above the Americas, and Algeria's oil reserves are the most abundant in the Sahara region. Take Hassi Messaoud as an example. There are more than 50 oil wells here, producing 30,000 tons of oil per day, which greatly exceeds the amount of water in the rivers on the desert surface. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that there are oil rivers under Algeria. It is estimated that there are 500 million tons of oil reserves here. If 10 million tons are transported out through crude oil pipelines every year, it will take 50 years to transport them all. There are currently three areas where oil is being extracted. One cannot imagine how many abundant oil rivers are crisscrossing under the desert of Algeria!
    The clutches of foreign monopoly capital have long been extended into the Sahara Desert. From the acquisition of date palm fruits to the exploitation of oil, there are their companies everywhere plundering profits. In the oil field alone, there are currently about 20 companies engaged in exploration and exploitation. Among them, the most belong to French monopoly capital, and American imperialism is also trying its best to replace France's position. However, the heroic Algerian people have raised the sword of anti-imperialist independence and are carrying out a great struggle to cut off the claws. The treasure house of the Sahara will surely return to its true owner - the Algerian people.

    沙漠里的绿洲
    ——阿尔及利亚的沙漠富源
    诸葛文
    在英雄的阿尔及利亚境内，有很大面积是沙漠，它是世界最大的撒哈拉沙漠的一部分。人们且不要误会沙漠就完全是沙尘漫天或石砾遍地的荒野，这个沙漠还是阿尔及利亚人民的宝库呢，因为它的地面上点缀有繁星似的绿洲，地底下还蕴藏着流不尽的石油河。
    横亘在阿尔及利亚中部的古老山脉，经不起千万年的风霜摧残，已被蚀成为低岗浅丘。就在这些破石堆中，从地下冒出了潺潺的泉水，滋润着土地，长出了植物，我们称这呼种地方叫绿洲。勤劳智慧的阿尔及利亚人民在绿洲中广泛栽培着枣椰子树，使它成为撒哈拉沙漠中的代表树木。枣椰子树干笔直，高约十五到二十米，树顶上伸出长大的羽状复叶，叶梗之间悬挂着十来个果朿，每个果朿含有几十串枣椰子。青葱的叶簇点缀在漫无边际的黄沙上，真是别有风光。沙漠中格外明朗的阳光照到果皮上，更显得鲜艳可爱。说起枣椰子，其实对我们也并不生疏，它和伊拉克蜜枣是同一种植物的果实，仅产地不同而已。枣椰子汁多味甜，是绿洲居民重要的食粮，也是穆斯林们在开斋节前后的主要食品。枣椰子每株树一年可以结果三十到二百公斤，阿尔及利亚农民每年从树上收获到不少口粮，因此他们十分珍视这些小绿洲，称为“真主的花园”。
    撒哈拉沙漠的石油是最近十多年来才大量发现的，目前虽还没有完全揭露地下的秘密，但根据已有资料看，撒哈拉石油储量大概可以占资本主义世界的第二位，仅次于中东，在美洲之上，而阿尔及利亚的石油蕴藏又是撒哈拉地区最多的。仅以哈遂·迈索达一地来看吧，这里现有五十多口井出油，每天可出油三万吨，大大超过了沙漠地面河流的水量了，所以说阿尔及利亚的地下有石油河并非言过其实。这里石油储量估计有五亿吨，目前用粗油管一年向外输送一千万吨，也要输送五十年。目前已经采油的就有三个地区。真不能设想，在阿尔及利亚的沙漠下面究竟纵横着有多少条丰润的石油河呢！
    外国垄断资本的魔掌早已伸进了撒哈拉沙漠，从枣椰子的收购到石油的开采，到处都有它们的公司在搜括利润。仅石油方面，目前就有二十家左右的公司在进行勘探和开采。其中属于法国垄断资本的最多，美帝国主义也正极力取法国的地位而代之。不过，英雄的阿尔及利亚人民已经举起了反帝独立的利剑，正在进行砍断魔爪的伟大斗争。撒哈拉的宝库一定会回到它的真正主人——阿尔及利亚人民的手中。
