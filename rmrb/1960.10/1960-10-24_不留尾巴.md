    Leaving No Loose Ends
    The Lahao Production Team of the Pinghu Commune in Dushan County, Guizhou Province, has set an example for us in doing a good job of wrapping up the autumn harvest.
    This year, the team's autumn harvest was faster and better than in the past. However, they were not satisfied with their achievements, but advanced victoriously, and further carried out a movement throughout the team to ensure that the autumn harvest was fully collected and completely cleaned up to increase production and save resources. By harvesting scattered crops, re-threshing, and cleaning the threshing grounds, they increased their harvest by 11,632 catties of grain in just four days, accounting for 1.6% of the team's total autumn grain output; the recovered crop stalks were enough to feed 250 head of livestock for more than half a year.
    This year, all regions have further strengthened their leadership over autumn harvesting, concentrated more labor into the autumn harvest front, and paid more attention to careful harvesting and fine threshing. The quality of the autumn harvest is better than in any previous year. However, can we be even more perfect? How is the wrapping-up work being done? The facts from the Pinghu Commune tell us that there are still loopholes to be plugged in the autumn harvest wrapping-up work.
    The autumn harvest should not only collect the main grain crops well, but also collect miscellaneous grains and various economic crops well; it should not only collect crops on large plots of land well, but also collect crops on "five-edge" land and various scattered small plots of land well; it should not only ensure that the grain is stored in the granary, but also collect and store all by-products—stalks, vines, leaves, etc.
    In particular, it is even more important this year to collect the scattered crops on various small plots of land. This summer and autumn, various localities mobilized the masses to expand the planting of miscellaneous grains, oilseeds, melons, and vegetables on wasteland and various vacant lands with the spirit of "every inch of land must be fought for" and the method of "sowing wherever there is space." These crops mature at different times and are relatively scattered, with ditches and depressions, roadsides, and house sides everywhere. If you are not careful, you will miss or delay the harvest.
    Cadres of communes and production teams should tighten their grip on the wrapping-up work of the autumn harvest at all levels. They should go deep into the fields and threshing grounds, and carefully check the harvesting and threshing of all crops, without missing a single place. It is necessary to do a good job in political and ideological work, improve the masses' understanding, and formulate specific measures to ensure that the scattered crops in remote fields, dispersed land, and those that are labor-intensive to harvest are collected. Those crops that are additionally planted by production teams or individual commune members on scattered small plots of land should belong to the team and commune members. The Party's policy should be clarified to the commune members in a timely manner to facilitate the timely harvesting and threshing of these crops.
    The wrapping-up work of the autumn harvest is an important stage of the entire autumn harvest work. Leaders in various regions must conscientiously mobilize the masses in order to win a complete victory in the autumn harvest work.

    不留尾巴
    贵州独山县平湖公社拉高生产队在作好秋收扫尾工作中给我们树立了榜样。
    今年，这个队的秋收进行得比过去快，更比过去好。但是，他们没有满足已得的成就，而是乘胜前进，在全队进一步开展了秋收收全收净的增产节约运动。经过收割零星庄稼、复打二道、清扫晒场，仅四天功夫，就增收了一万一千六百三十二斤粮食，占全队秋粮总产量的1.6％；收回来的作物秸秆，足够二百五十头牲口吃多半年的饲料。
    今年各地都进一步加强了对秋收工作的领导，集中了更多的劳力投入秋收战线，更加注意了精收细打，秋收的质量比哪一年都好。但是，还能不能再精益求精呢？收尾工作做得怎样呢？平湖公社的事实告诉我们，秋收扫尾工作中还有漏洞可堵。
    秋收不仅要收好主粮，也要收好杂粮和各种经济作物，不仅要收好大块地上的作物，也要收好“五边”地和各种零星小片作物；不仅要使粮食颗粒归仓，还要把副产品——秸秆、藤叶等样样收好、藏好。
    特别是收好各种小片土地上的零星作物，在今年来说更加重要。今年夏秋之际，各地曾发动群众，以“寸土必争”的精神和“见缝插针”的办法，利用荒地和各种空隙土地，扩种了不少的杂粮、油料和瓜菜。这部分庄稼，成熟期先后不一，又比较零星分散，沟沟洼洼，路边、屋边到处都有，稍不注意，就会发生漏收、迟收。
    对秋收的扫尾工作，公社和生产队的干部应该层层抓紧，要深入到田间、场坝，对全部庄稼的收打情况，一处不漏，一丝不苟地进行认真地检查。要作好政治思想工作，提高群众认识，订出具体办法，保证把那些边远田、分散地、收割费工的零星庄稼收回来。那些由生产小队或社员个人利用零散小片土地增种的庄稼，应该归小队和社员所有，要及时向社员讲清党的这个政策，以利于这些庄稼的适时收打。
    秋收的扫尾工作是整个秋收工作的一个重要阶段，各地领导上必须认真地动员群众，才能获得秋收工作的全胜。
