    Make Every Effort to Plant Winter Wheat Well
    Replanting Success with New Farm Tools
    Our commune has fewer fields for regular-crop wheat and more for replanted wheat this year. For many replanted fields, the crops must be sown with wheat before they are even harvested. How can we deep plow, fertilize, and sow wheat in fields where crops are still growing? Song Gaolu, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, has pondered this question countless times.

    One day at noon, Secretary Song came to the tool reform factory in the Jibi Management Area after lunch and asked the factory workers to reform the plough and seed drill. He said, "Can we install a seed drill on the plough and a fertilizer applicator on the seed drill, so that the processes of plowing, sowing, and fertilizing can be completed in one operation?" The factory director convened all the workers and Secretary Song for a "Zhuge Liang meeting." Everyone researched and designed together, and once there was a draft, they all started working on it. After the new farm tool was made, it was tested in the field, but it couldn't be pulled. The reason was that the ploughshare and seed drill hoes were too close and the volume was too large. The clever girl Zheng Ying came up with a solution to remove the ploughshare ears, which solved the problem. Then it was discovered that the soil could not be covered after sowing, and the sowing width was too narrow to meet the requirements of close planting. After research, the seed drill legs were deepened, the distance between the ploughshare and the seed drill hoes was widened, and an iron piece was added under the seed eye. The problem of covering the soil and widening the sowing width was also solved. A farm tool that can plow, sow, and fertilize for planting wheat was finally successfully trial-produced. The commune members happily said: "Now we have a solution for intercropping replanted wheat!"

### 种回茬麦有新农具

    千方百计  种好冬麦
    种回茬麦有新农具
    我们公社今年的麦田正茬少，回茬多。很多回茬地的作物，等不到收割就得种上麦子。在生长作物的田里，怎样深耕施肥种麦呢？公社党委第一书记宋高禄为这个问题不知想过多少遍。
    一天中午，宋书记吃过午饭来到了吉比管理区的工具改革厂，向厂中职工提出改革犁耧的问题。他说：“能不能在犁上安耧，在耧上再安个施肥器，把耕地、播种、施肥几道工序一次完成？”厂长召集全体职工和宋书记一起开了个“诸葛亮会”。大家边研究，边设计，有了一个草图就一齐干起来了。新农具做成以后，到地里一试验，拉不动。原因是犁铧和耧铧距离近，体积过大。巧姑娘郑英想出了一个打掉铧耳朵的办法，解决了问题。接着又发现播种后不能盖土，播种的幅度窄，不合密植的规格。经过研究，加深了耧腿，放开了犁铧与耧铧的距离，在下籽的眼底下加上了一块铁片，盖土和加宽播种幅度的问题也得到了解决。一架能耕地，又能播种施肥的种麦的农具，终于试制成功了。社员们高兴地说：“这一下套种回茬小麦可有办法了。”
