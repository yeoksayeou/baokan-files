Xinhua News Agency, October 24th dispatch from Tokyo: The Japan National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations held an activists meeting in Tokyo on the 23rd. The meeting decided to fight for the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations and the crushing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

    The meeting unanimously agreed that the struggle to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations is inseparable from the struggle to crush the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and strive for Japan's independence and neutrality.

    The meeting believes that the movement to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations is an important part of the common struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism and to force U.S. imperialism into isolation.

    The meeting confirmed that the three political principles for Japan-China relations advocated by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai must become the basis for breaking the deadlock in Japan-China relations and that these three principles must be adhered to in order to advance the movement.

    Many participants emphasized in their speeches that in promoting the common struggle of the people of Japan and China, it is necessary to abide by the joint statement issued by the twelve Japanese visiting delegations to China and the eight Chinese people's organizations.

    The meeting decided that they would launch a struggle in the election campaign, calling on the Japanese people to support the three principles for Japan-China relations put forward by China, strive for the immediate restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, support China's restoration of its legitimate seat in the United Nations, and strive to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Asian region, and crush the anti-China New Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty".

    Participants in the meeting included activists from Tokyo and other places such as Osaka, Saga, and Chiba who are striving for the restoration of the Japan-China diplomatic relations movement.

    Xinhua News Agency, October 20th dispatch from Tokyo: Approximately 700 workers, students, women, and merchants in Osaka City, Japan, held a rally tonight demanding the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations and the development of trade between the two countries.

    The conference was jointly organized by the Japan National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, and the local organizations of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan in the Kansai region and Osaka City.

    The conference passed a resolution demanding that the Ikeda government change its anti-China policy, conclude a trade agreement with the Chinese government, and support the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

    Before passing the resolution, all participants observed a moment of silence to mourn Inejiro Asanuma, the chairman of the Socialist Party who was murdered by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.
