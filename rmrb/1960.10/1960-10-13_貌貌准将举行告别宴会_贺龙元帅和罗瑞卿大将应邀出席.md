Xinhua News Agency, 12th - Brigadier General Maung Maung, head of the Burmese Military Friendship Delegation, held a farewell banquet at the Beijing Hotel this evening. The Burmese Military Friendship Delegation is about to leave Beijing to visit various places in southern China.

Vice Premier of the State Council, Marshal He Long, and Vice Premier of the State Council and Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, General Luo Ruiqing, attended the banquet at invitation.

Brigadier General Maung Maung spoke at the beginning of the banquet. In his speech, he warmly praised the friendship between the people and the armies of Burma and China. He said that the Burmese Military Friendship Delegation has been visiting China for more than half a month. During this period, whether in major cities, large factories, or military units, we have heard people warmly praising Burmese-Chinese friendship, and we are particularly pleased about this.

When speaking about his impressions of his visit to China, Brigadier General Maung Maung highly praised the labor and efforts of the Chinese people, pointing out that China has made significant progress and great development in industry, agriculture, and other fields. He said they were encouraged and pleased by this.

Brigadier General Maung Maung said that during their visit, the Burmese Military Friendship Delegation received a warm welcome from all sectors of Chinese society, and especially received enthusiastic welcome and cordial reception from senior generals, officers, and soldiers of various units of the People's Liberation Army. Brigadier General Maung Maung called these Chinese hosts their "Pauk-Phaw" friends and expressed his heartfelt thanks to all Chinese friends. Brigadier General Maung Maung concluded by proposing a toast to the everlasting friendship between Burma and China.

General Luo Ruiqing spoke at the banquet. He said that the people of China and Burma are not only close neighbors but also intimate friends, and our two countries have a long history of friendly exchanges. Especially in our common struggle against imperialist aggression and oppression and for our respective national independence, and on the path of jointly upholding and promoting the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the close friendship between our two countries has been further enhanced.

General Luo Ruiqing said that the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty fully embodies the desire of our two peoples to maintain peace and enhance friendship. This not only conforms to the highest interests and good wishes of our two peoples, but also makes a significant contribution to consolidating peace in Asia and the world. He said that while our two peoples, and the peoples of all countries in the world, are rejoicing over the ever-growing friendship between our two countries, the imperialists and their followers are unhappy about this. They do not like our friendship and peaceful coexistence and have consistently engaged in provocations, attempting to create disputes between us. However, ironclad facts have shattered these vicious conspiracies and shameless tricks of the imperialists.

General Luo Ruiqing said that our Burmese friends are about to leave Beijing to visit other parts of our country, and we are fully confident that through your visit, new contributions will be made to further enhancing the friendship and understanding between the peoples and armies of China and Burma.
