Xinhua News Agency, October 18th -- Ben Amar Hassib, head of the Tunisian Neo-Destour Party delegation currently on a friendly visit to our country, held a reception tonight to warmly bid farewell to the people of our country.

At the reception, head of the delegation Ben Amar Hassib expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for the friendship of the Tunisian people. He said that the delegation he led had the opportunity to witness firsthand the tremendous efforts made by the Chinese people to build their own country, and to witness the great achievements of the Chinese people. These achievements were originally something that Western capitalist countries were unwilling to believe. He emphasized that the Chinese people, who are building a better future, have truly chosen their own correct path, and that the labor you are engaged in today is precisely for a better life tomorrow, and for living in peace. He pointed out that liberated people are able to control their own destiny.

Ben Amar Hassib said that the Tunisian people are today struggling to build their own new life. He said that their struggle has always relied on the friendship of the people of all countries in the world, and on the friendship given by the Chinese people. This friendship will certainly be further strengthened in the future. In conclusion, the head of the delegation stated that after their delegation returns home, they will tell the Tunisian people that the Chinese people are a great people, and a people moving forward on the road of progress, freedom, and peace. He proposed a toast to the ever-stronger and eternal friendship between the two peoples. Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, said at the reception that the friendly visit to China by the Tunisian Neo-Destour Party delegation will help further promote mutual understanding and the development of friendship between the Chinese and Tunisian peoples. Zhang Xiruo expressed his belief that the Chinese and Tunisian peoples will definitely unite further in the struggle against imperialism in the future. He hoped that the delegation would bring the sincere friendship of the Chinese people to the Tunisian people.

Invited to attend today's reception were Burhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Zhang Su, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Lian Guan, Deputy Secretary-General; Qu Wu and Xu Pingyu, Vice Presidents of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association; Huang Zhong, Deputy Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission; Xu Guangping, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation; Wang Zhaohua, Standing Committee member of the All-China Youth Federation; Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation; Zhao Pengfei, Deputy Mayor of Beijing; and other relevant figures.
