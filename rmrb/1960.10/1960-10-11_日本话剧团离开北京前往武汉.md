Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The artists of the Japanese Theatrical Troupe, having concluded their visit and performances in Beijing, departed Beijing by train this morning for Wuhan, carrying the profound friendship and best wishes of the capital's artists and people from all walks of life.

Yang Hansheng and Xia Yan, Vice Presidents of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries; Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association; Vice Chairmen Ouyang Yuqian, Mei Lanfang, and Cao Yu; prominent figures from the capital's literary and art circles Xu Guangping, Lü Ji, Li Bozhao, Chen Qitong, and Zhou Erfu, among others, as well as hundreds of people, representing the warm feelings of the capital's people, went to the Beijing Railway Station to see them off. Present at the station to see them off was also Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji, who is in Beijing.

Before boarding the train, the leader of the Japanese Theatrical Troupe, Tomoyoshi Murayama, the deputy leaders Koreya Senda, Osamu Takizawa, Yasue Yamamoto, Haruko Sugimura and all the artists, a deeply moving scene unfolded at the Beijing Railway Station. Amidst warm applause, the capital's artists presented bouquets of flowers to all the Japanese artists. The artists of both countries shook hands and embraced each other excitedly, exchanging souvenirs. Many Japanese artists repeatedly wiped away tears from their faces, bid farewell to their Chinese friends with deep emotion, and sang songs like "Tokyo - Beijing" and "Socialism is Good." The send-off crowd also sang "Unity is Strength." The songs of the artists of both countries intertwined, forming a moving chorus of unity and friendship.

After the train started, the Japanese artists leaned out of the train windows, some waving bouquets of flowers, some waving tightly clenched hands, and the hundreds of people seeing them off on the platform also waved to them. Both on the train and on the platform, people shouted: "Goodbye!" "Goodbye!"
