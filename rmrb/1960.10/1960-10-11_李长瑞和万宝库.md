    When you step into the gate of the Anshan Welded Pipe Products Factory, you can see neatly arranged iron boxes beside the machine repair workshop, filled with copper filings, tungsten filings, iron filings, and various scrap copper sleeves and washers… All these things were accumulated by tool storekeeper Li Changrui from all over the place.
    Not long ago, the copper worm nut of a rolling mill in the pipe-making workshop broke. Zhang Enzhi, a fitter from the repair team, went to the spare parts warehouse to get a copper worm nut, but the warehouse didn't have this spare part. He wanted to find material to process it on the spot, but he couldn't find a copper rod for a while. What to do? He suddenly thought of Li Changrui's "Ten-Thousand Treasure Trove" and hurried to find Li Changrui. Li Changrui immediately took out two copper rods from the box. Zhang Enzhi was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth.
    Li Changrui's "Ten-Thousand Treasure Trove" has solved urgent needs for the workers in this way. (Bian)

    李长瑞和万宝库
    当你一踏进鞍山焊管制品厂的大门，就可以看到在机修车间的一旁，整齐地排放着几个铁箱子，里面放的尽是铜沫子、钨金沫子、铁沫子和各种废铜套、垫圈……。这些东西都是工具库保管员李长瑞日积月累从各处捡回来的。
    不久前，造管车间轧钢机的一个铜蜗母丝断了，包修组钳工张恩志跑到备品库去领铜蜗母丝，偏偏库里没有这个备品了，他想找料现加工，但一时又找不到铜棒，怎么办呢？他忽然想起李长瑞“万宝库”，就急忙去找李长瑞，李长瑞立即从箱子里取出两根铜棒，张恩志一看乐得嘴都合不上了。
    李长瑞的“万宝库”就是这样为工人们解决了燃眉之急。（边）
