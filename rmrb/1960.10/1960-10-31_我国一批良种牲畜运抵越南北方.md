Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 29th. Recently, a batch of fine breed cattle, horses, sheep and pigs from China were transported thousands of miles to Northern Vietnam and "settled down" on some farms. Among them were Xinjiang sheep, Inner Mongolian cattle and horses, and Heilongjiang pigs.

These large livestock were transported in accordance with the agreement signed between the Chinese and Vietnamese governments in March this year on China's assistance to Vietnam in building eight modern farms.

According to the aforementioned agreement, China will also successively transport various agricultural machinery, equipment, and saplings. A group of Chinese experts responsible for helping to formulate plans for these farms have already arrived here.

    我国一批良种牲畜运抵越南北方
    新华社河内29日电　一批来自中国的良种牛、马、绵羊和猪，最近远程万里运到越南北方，在一些农场“安家落户”。其中，有新疆的绵羊，内蒙古的牛和马，黑龙江的猪。
    这些大家畜是根据中越两国政府今年3月间签订的关于由中国帮助越南建设八个现代化农场的议定书运来的。
    根据上述议定书，中国还将陆续运来各种农业机械、设备和树苗。负责帮助为这些农场制定规划的一批中国专家已经到达这里。
