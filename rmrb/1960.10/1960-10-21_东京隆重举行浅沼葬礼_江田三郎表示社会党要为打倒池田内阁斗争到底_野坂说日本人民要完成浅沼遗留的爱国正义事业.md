Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th - A grand funeral for Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, was held this afternoon at the Hibiya Public Hall in Tokyo—the site of Asanuma's assassination. The funeral was organized by the Socialist Party.

More than 2,600 people attended the funeral, including Asanuma's family and representatives from various political parties and organizations. In addition, more than 4,000 workers, students, women, and ordinary citizens braved the rain to gather at the Hibiya Park Open-Air Music Hall to mourn Asanuma.

At 1:00 PM, after the funeral began, all those attending sang the song "Comrade, You Are Not Dead!" together with grief and indignation. Then, they observed a minute of silence to mourn this anti-American patriotic activist and outstanding Japanese politician who was killed by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. At this time, workers and staff in many factories, mines, and offices across the country also held workplace meetings and observed a minute of silence to express their condolences and to show that they would turn their grief into strength and fight to the end for Japan's peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality!

Eda Saburo, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party and Chairman of the Funeral Committee, read a eulogy at the meeting. Eda pointed out that those who benefited from the assassination of Asanuma are the real murderers, and "our grief and indignation should be directed at them."

Eda stated that they would fight to the end to overthrow the Ikeda Cabinet, which condoned the fascist thugs who assassinated Asanuma.

Representatives from various sectors took the stage to deliver eulogies. Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, praised Asanuma's great contributions to the struggle against U.S. imperialism. He also pointed out that because Asanuma fearlessly exposed U.S. imperialism as the common enemy of the people of Japan and China and carried out activities along this line, the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries hated him and finally assassinated him.

Nosaka emphasized that this despicable act by the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries cannot weaken the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality; instead, the Japanese people have turned their grief into anger and strengthened their struggle. He said that the patriotic and just cause left behind by Asanuma will surely be completed.

Akira Iwai, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and Renzo Yanagisawa, a representative of the Federation of Independent Unions, unanimously stated that Japanese workers will stand tall and stride forward in the direction pointed out by Asanuma.

Hirozo Minakuchi, Secretary-General of the "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," Kiyoshi Aono, a representative of the cultural circles, Tsuko Matsuoka, a representative of women, and representatives of the All-Japan Farmers Association also delivered eulogies.

Kanju Kato, Advisor to the Socialist Party, read a pledge on behalf of all Socialist Party members. The pledge stated that Socialist Party members will inherit Asanuma's legacy, stand at the forefront of the people, and fight for the realization of independence, peace, and democracy.

Asanuma Kyoko, Asanuma's wife, delivered a reply at the funeral ceremony.

During the funeral ceremony, telegrams of condolence from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and heads of various Chinese people's organizations, as well as from the Communist Party, Workers' Party, and Socialist Parties of several countries, were read.

After singing the memorial song, those attending the funeral went to the altar where Asanuma's remains were placed to offer bouquets.

At the same time, a farewell ceremony was held today in the auditorium of the elementary school near Inejiro Asanuma's residence. Workers, housewives, and old women carrying children who lived nearby crowded the auditorium, going to the altar to burn incense and offer bouquets.

Local organizations of the Socialist Party in cities such as Osaka, Yokohama, Kobe, Otsu, Sapporo, Takamatsu, and Tokushima also held memorial services for Asanuma today. Approximately 7,000 representatives from all sectors of Osaka and ordinary citizens attended the memorial service. After the meeting, all participants demonstrated in the streets, protesting the reactionaries' assassination of Asanuma.

    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎的葬礼今天下午在东京日比谷公会堂—浅沼遇刺地点隆重举行。葬礼是由社会党主持的。
    浅沼遗属和各政党、各界团体代表两千六百多人参加了葬礼。另外，有四千多名工人、学生、妇女和一般市民冒雨汇集在日比谷公园露天音乐堂吊念浅沼。
    下午一点，葬礼开始后，全体参加葬礼的人们怀着悲愤的心情齐声合唱歌曲“同志，你没有死！”然后默哀一分钟，悼念这位被美日反动派杀害的反美爱国的积极战士、日本卓越的政治家。在这时，全国许许多多工厂、矿山和办公室的工人和职员们也同时举行工作场所大会和默哀一分钟，表示哀悼，并且表示要把悲痛变成力量，为争取日本的和平、独立、民主和中立而奋斗到底！
    社会党书记长、治丧委员会委员长江田三郎在会上宣读悼词。江田指出，从杀害浅沼取得利益者就是真正的凶手，“我们的悲愤应该指向它们”。
    江田表示，要为打倒纵容法西斯暴徒杀害浅沼的池田内阁而斗争到底。
    各界代表相继登台致悼词。日本共产党主席野坂参三赞扬浅沼在反对美帝国主义的斗争中所作出的巨大贡献。他并且指出，由于浅沼毫无畏惧地揭露美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人，并按照这条路线展开了活动。因此，日美反动派仇恨他，终于杀害了他。
    野坂强调指出，日美反动派这一卑鄙行为并不能削弱日本人民争取独立、和平、民主和中立的斗争；日本人民反而把悲伤转为愤怒，加强了斗争。他说，浅沼所遗留的爱国正义事业一定能够完成。
    日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章和中立工会联合会代表柳泽鍊造一致表示，日本工人将挺起胸膛，向浅沼所指出的方向阔步迈进。
    “阻止修改安全条约国民会议”事务局长水口宏三、文化界代表青野季吉、妇女代表松冈津子以及全日本农民协会联合会代表也致悼词。
    社会党顾问加藤勘十代表全体社会党员宣读了誓词。誓词表示，社会党员将继承浅沼的遗志，站在人民的前列，为实现独立、和平、民主而斗争。
    浅沼夫人浅沼享子在葬礼仪式上致了答词。
    在葬礼仪式上，宣读了中国总理周恩来和中国各人民团体负责人以及若干国家共产党、工人党和社会党的唁电。
    参加葬礼的人们合唱追悼歌以后，相继前往安置浅沼遗骨的祭坛献花束。
    在浅沼稻次郎住宅附近的小学礼堂，今天同时举行了辞灵仪式。住在附近的工人、家庭妇女和背着小孩的老太太们挤满礼堂，纷纷走到祭坛烧香和献花束。
    社会党在大阪、横滨、神户、大津、札幌、高松、德岛等城市的地方组织，今天也为浅沼举行了追悼会。大阪各界代表和一般市民共约七千人参加了追悼会。会后全体与会者到街上示威游行，抗议反动派杀害浅沼。
