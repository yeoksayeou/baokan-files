Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang - Liaoning Province, after overcoming the extraordinary flood disaster in early August, continued to achieve a great victory in the autumn harvest. During the busy autumn harvest season, people in urban and rural areas mobilized, with workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers all participating. From the mountains to the plains, everywhere was filled with joyous activity, creating an excellent situation of fast, clean, complete, and good autumn harvesting. At present, the province's major autumn crops have been basically harvested and are being re-harvested. Most of the labor force has been transferred to a campaign of rushing to transport, thresh, and autumn ploughing. While concentrating on the autumn harvest, the small autumn harvest campaign is also in full swing in various places, with the harvest of various wild plants and mountain goods more than doubling compared to the same period last year.

In early August this year, the eastern region of Liaoning suffered from an extraordinary flood. Thanks to the kind concern of the Party Central Committee and the strong support of fraternal provinces, cities, and urban people, the rural people's communes fully utilized their superiority. After the disaster, they quickly achieved major victories in draining water, replanting, and restoring production, greatly reducing the extent of the disaster. Since the beginning of the autumn harvest, the people in the disaster areas have taken practical actions of "every grain returned home, not a blade of grass left behind" to strive for victory in the autumn harvest, making autumn harvest production in full swing. By the 20th of this month, the people of Liaozhong, Xinmin, and other three counties in the disaster area had not only harvested more than 2.8 million mu of autumn grain crops, but also collected more than 15 million catties of wild forage grass seeds and 96.8 million catties of Leymus chinensis. Various sideline productions have also been further developed, with income reaching more than 3.88 million yuan. Under the slogan of "increasing production and ensuring harvest to support the disaster area," the people in the vast non-disaster areas are experiencing unprecedented activity in autumn harvest production. The people's communes in various counties under Fuxin City, which had a relatively good year, mobilized hundreds of thousands of people, worked hard for twenty days, and basically completed the harvest of grain crops and turned to hauling and threshing.

In order to make up for disaster losses and reduce the burden on the state, the entire party and people of Liaoning Province were determined from the beginning of the autumn harvest to go all out to obtain all the autumn harvest fruits. In mid-September, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee specially formed an autumn harvest headquarters to comprehensively deploy and deeply mobilize the province's autumn harvest work. The city, county, and people's communes also formed autumn harvest headquarters, led by secretaries at each level, with six levels of cadres meeting in the fields, carrying forward the style of "two brings" (bringing sickle, bringing luggage) and "four togethers" (eating together, living together, working together, discussing together), and working hard with the masses in the autumn harvest. Various places have dispatched a large number of cadres to enrich the leadership at the grassroots level. The five cities of Anshan, Fushun, Jinzhou, Chaoyang, and Fuxin alone dispatched more than 11,000 cadres to serve as deputy captains or deputy branch secretaries in production teams, strengthening the leadership of the autumn harvest.

In order to achieve timely harvesting, people's communes in various rural areas have taken various effective measures and organized more than 80% of the labor force to participate in the front line of the autumn harvest. During the busy season, a total of 4.5 million commune members participated in the rush harvest throughout the province. Various towns and cities also organized 3.2 million government cadres, workers, students, and PLA officers and soldiers to go to the countryside to support the harvest. At the same time, many areas, in response to the grain threshing work with the largest labor requirement during the autumn harvest, carried out tool reforms and manufactured and promoted tens of thousands of threshing machines for autumn harvesting.

In autumn harvest production, people's communes in various places have universally adopted various measures such as strengthening ideological education, formulating technical operating procedures, promoting small-group contracting, establishing inspection and acceptance systems, and organizing grain-picking professional teams, to firmly grasp the word "clean" from beginning to end and strive for every grain to return to the granary. In various places, the professional grain-picking teams mainly composed of old, weak laborers and primary school students alone numbered 700,000 people. Under the slogan of "gleaning the ground clean, digging the underground clean, plugging loopholes, not a grain left behind," they have devoted themselves to the grain-picking and re-harvesting campaign, and have already picked up more than 15 million catties of grain.

Various places have universally implemented the policy of taking grain as the key link and making comprehensive arrangements, adopting methods such as dividing battle lines, organizing professional teams, and launching phased assaults, not only harvesting major autumn grains and cash crops, but also harvesting wild plants, creating a vivid scene on the autumn harvest front of great autumn harvest being harvested fully and well, and small autumn harvest having all treasures entering the warehouse. According to statistics on October 20, various places have collected more than 2.5 billion catties of wild forage grass and feed, and collected more than 1.56 billion catties of wild plants that can be used to manufacture fiber, tannin extract, and oil.

    拣净地上  挖净地下  颗粒归仓  寸草不丢
    辽宁细收秋粮弥补特大洪灾损失
    专业队大采野生植物收获量比去年同期增加一倍多
    据新华社沈阳讯　辽宁省在战胜8月初特大洪水灾害之后，继续取得了秋收的巨大胜利。在抢收大忙时期，城乡人民总动员，工农商学兵齐上阵，从山野到平原，到处人欢马跃，热气腾腾，秋收战线出现了一片又快又净又全又好的大好形势。目前全省大秋作物已经基本收完，正在复收，大部分劳力已转入突击拉运、打场和秋翻地运动。在集中力量秋收的同时，各地小秋收运动也搞得热火朝天，各种野生植物和山货野果的收获量比去年同期增加了一倍以上。
    今年8月初辽宁东部地区遭受了特大洪水的袭击，由于党中央亲切关怀和兄弟省、市与城市人民大力支援，农村人民公社充分发挥了优越性，灾后迅速取得排涝抢种、恢复生产的重大胜利，大大缩小了灾害的程度。进入秋收以来，灾区人民纷纷以“颗粒还家，寸草不丢”的实际行动，争取秋收战线的胜利，秋收生产搞得热火朝天。灾区辽中、新民等三县人民，到本月20日，不但已收获秋粮作物二百八十多万亩，还采集野生饲料草籽一千五百多万斤，打羊草九千六百八十多万斤；各种副业生产也有了更大开展，收入达到三百八十八万多元。广大非灾区人民在“增产保收，支援灾区”的口号下，秋收生产空前活跃。今年年景较好的阜新市所属各县人民公社，出动几十万人，大干二十天，就基本收完了粮谷作物，转入拉地、打场。
    为了弥补受灾损失，减轻国家负担，辽宁省全党全民秋收一开始就下定决心，一定要全力以赴把一切秋收果实全部拿到手。中共辽宁省委在9月中旬专门组成了秋收指挥部，对全省秋收工作作了全面部署和深入动员。各市、县、人民公社也分别组成秋收指挥部，层层由书记挂帅，六级干部会师田间，发扬“两带”（带镰刀、带行李）、“四同”（同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量）的作风，与群众一道大闹秋收。各地都下派大批干部，充实基层领导力量。仅鞍山、抚顺、锦州、朝阳、阜新五个市，就下派了一万一千多名干部，到生产队担任副队长或副支部书记，加强了秋收的领导。
    为了做到收割适时，各地农村人民公社采取了各种有效措施，组织80％以上的劳动力投入了秋收第一线。在大忙时期，全省共有四百五十万社员参加抢收，各城镇还组织了三百二十万机关干部、职工、学生和解放军官兵下乡支援。同时，许多地区针对着秋收作业中用工量最多的脱谷工作，大搞工具改革，制造和推广了成千上万台脱谷机投入秋收作业。
    在秋收生产中，各地人民公社普遍采取了加强思想教育、制订技术操作规程、推行小组包工、建立检查验收制度和组织拣粮专业队等各种措施，自始至终狠抓“净”字，力争颗粒归仓。各地单是以老弱劳动力和小学生为主组织的拣粮专业队伍就有七十万人，他们在“拣净地上，挖净地下，堵塞漏洞，颗粒不丢”的口号下，投入拣粮复收运动，已拣回粮食一千五百多万斤。
    各地普遍贯彻以粮为纲、全面安排的方针，采取划分战线、组织专业队伍、分段突击等办法，既收大秋粮食和经济作物，又收野生植物，使秋收战线上出现了大秋收收全收好、小秋收万宝入库的生动局面。到10月20日统计，各地已采集野生饲草、饲料二十五亿多斤，采集可供制造纤维、栲胶、油料的野生植物十五亿六千多万斤。
