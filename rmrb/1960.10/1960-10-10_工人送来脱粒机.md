    Workers Send a Threshing Machine
    Gong Chang
    As the rice comes in, songs arise,
    Songs bring the threshing machine near,
    The threshing machine, draped in colorful silk,
    Workers, our brothers, have sent it here.
    The workers start the threshing machine,
    Commune members busily hand over bundles of rice,
    Only a rumbling sound is heard,
    Golden rain falls on the ground.
    The accountant brings over a large scale,
    Face beaming with a smile so wide:
    "The friendship between workers and peasants is heavier than mountains,
    My scale cannot weigh it!"

    工人送来脱粒机
    弓长稻谷登场歌声起，歌声拥来脱粒机，脱粒机呀披彩绸，工人大哥送咱的。工人开动脱粒机，社员忙将稻把递，只听隆隆一阵响，平地落下黄金雨。会计推来大磅秤，满脸红光笑嘻嘻：“工农情谊重如山，我这磅秤打不起！”
