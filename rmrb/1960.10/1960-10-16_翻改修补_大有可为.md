Refurbishing, altering, and repairing, practicing diligence and thrift in nation-building, are necessary means and fundamental principles for building socialism. Developing refurbishing and repairing services, and vigorously promoting the exchange of old for new, embodies the spirit of these principles. By doing so, the large amount of old clothing accumulated by residents will create infinite new value and save a large amount of materials for society.

In the upsurge of the production increase and economy drive centered on grain and steel, our city's finance and trade departments, in accordance with the Party's instruction of "grasping production with one hand and living standards with the other," launched a mass movement for saving resources and waste utilization, refurbishing, altering, and repairing throughout the city. Since the beginning of autumn, more than two thousand service stations, more than nine hundred sewing groups, more than seven thousand service personnel, and more than one thousand sewing machines have been organized, and the broad masses of the people have been mobilized to actively participate in this work. In early September alone, the sewing service organization of the Xinxing Branch of the Daowai People's Commune had already disassembled, washed, refurbished, altered, and repaired more than 180,000 pieces of clothing for the masses; through methods such as converting large sizes into small sizes and turning old items into new ones, more than 70,000 feet of cotton cloth were saved.

In this work, due to the close reliance of the finance and trade departments on the leadership of Party committees at all levels, and the adoption of a method combining the active establishment of refurbishing and repairing service undertakings by the finance and trade departments with the vigorous promotion of mass movements, the city has completed a large amount of cotton clothing refurbishing and repairing work. However, there are still some cotton clothes, shoes, hats, and knitwear, woolen goods, and fur clothing that need to be refurbished and repaired. We must further actively carry out this work.

To do this work well, we must first make the broad masses of the people recognize the significance of vigorously promoting resource conservation and waste utilization, refurbishing, and repairing, and understand the principle that small savings can add up to large amounts, and that many little things can make a big thing. We are a city with several million people. If our work on resource conservation and waste utilization is carried out well, and we achieve "making the best use of everything," then this is not a small matter, but a matter of great potential. It is of great significance for comprehensively organizing the people's economic life and for deeply developing the production increase and economy drive.

This work cannot be completed by any one department alone. Therefore, it is necessary to combine commune-run and factory-enterprise-run organizations, combine service stations with mobilizing the masses to do it themselves, combine large-scale refurbishing and repairing with large-scale waste product acquisition and comprehensive utilization, and combine large-scale resource conservation and waste utilization with launching mass patriotic health campaigns, so as to fully mobilize the forces of all parties. Only in this way can we better complete this huge social service work in a relatively short period of time. On the one hand, the Daowai People's Commune relies on the original 170 professional personnel of the commune-run laundry and dyeing factory and the sewing and alteration group to implement "position service." At the same time, it has also organized a group of elderly and physically weak housewives to engage in some sporadic repair work at home, which has played a great auxiliary role for state-owned outlets and service stations. The commune has also organized mobile service teams to provide door-to-door services to residents, making it more convenient for the masses.

In order to meet the diverse needs of the masses, the finance and trade departments must expand the scope of services from the original general washing, dyeing, and repairing to the renovation of old fur clothing, shoes, and hats, and the darning of woolen sweaters and trousers, autumn clothing and trousers, woolen socks, gloves, leather clothing coloring and oiling, and other services. At the same time, it is necessary to improve the quality of repairs, shorten repair time, and increase express repair departments and express cleaning departments to ensure that the quality and price match, so that the masses are satisfied. The vast majority of service personnel must serve the masses wholeheartedly, enthusiastically, in every possible way, and diligently and thoughtfully, in order to strive to better meet the needs of the masses for refurbishing and repairing all kinds of clothing, large and small.

Leading cadres at all levels of the finance and trade departments must go deep into the front line of service work, discover problems and solve them in a timely manner, summarize and exchange experiences, establish models, and carry out a grand competition of excellent service comparing quantity, quality, speed, and service attitude, so as to make greater achievements in resource conservation and waste utilization, refurbishing, and repairing work.

    翻改修补　大有可为
    中共哈尔滨市委财贸部副部长　王玄
    增产节约，勤俭建国，是建设社会主义的必要手段和根本原则。开展翻改修补业务，大搞以旧代新，体现了这一原则精神。这样做，居民中积存的大量的旧衣着必将创造出无穷的新的价值，为社会节约大量物资。
    在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动高潮中，我市财贸部门本着党的“一手抓生产、一手抓生活”的指示，在全市范围内掀起了一个节约利废、翻改修补的群众运动。入秋以来，已经组织起两千多个服务站，九百多个缝补小组，七千多名服务人员，一千多台缝纫机器，并动员起广大人民群众，积极地投入了这一工作。仅道外人民公社新兴分社的缝补服务组织在9月初就已为群众拆洗翻改修补衣物十八万多件；经过以大改小，以旧翻新等办法，节约棉布七万多尺。
    在这项工作中，由于财贸部门紧紧依靠了各级党委的领导，采取了财贸部门积极举办翻改修补服务事业与大搞群众运动相结合的方法，全市已完成了大量棉服翻改修补业务。但是，还有一些棉服和鞋帽以及针织、毛织、毛皮等衣物需要翻改修补。我们必须进一步积极开展这项工作。
    要做好这项工作，首先要使广大人民群众认清大搞节约利废、翻改修补的意义，理解积少可以成多、集腋可以成裘的道理。我们是几百万人口的城市，如果我们节约利废工作开展得好，作到“物尽其用”，那就不是什么小事，而是大有可为的事情。它对于全面组织人民经济生活，对于深入开展增产节约运动都有重要意义。
    这项工作不是哪一个部门单独可以完成的，因此必须实行公社办和工厂企业等团体办相结合，服务站做和发动群众自己动手做相结合，大搞翻改修补和大搞废品收购与综合利用相结合，大搞节约利废和开展群众性爱国卫生运动相结合，把各方面的力量充分地调动起来。这样才能在较短的时间内更好地完成这项巨大的社会服务工作。道外人民公社一方面依靠原有的社办洗染工厂和缝补修改小组的一百七十多名专业人员实行“阵地服务”，同时又组织了一部分年老体弱的家庭妇女，在家里从事一些零星修补工作，她们对国营网点及服务站起了很大的辅助作用。这个公社还组织了流动服务队，深入居民住户就地服务，更加方便了群众。
    为了适应群众的多种要求，财贸部门必须把服务范围从原有的一般洗染修补，发展到毛皮衣物鞋帽的整旧翻新和织补毛衣毛裤、秋衣秋裤、毛袜手套、皮衣刷色擦油等多项服务。同时要提高修补质量，缩短修理时间，增加快修部、快洗部，做到质价相称，使群众称心如意。要广大服务人员，必须全心全意、满腔热忱、千方百计、殷勤周到地为群众服务，以争取更多更好地满足群众翻改修补大大小小、各种各样衣着的需要。
    财贸部门各级领导干部要深入到服务工作第一线，及时发现问题解决问题，总结交流经验，树立典型，开展一个比数量、比质量、比速度、比服务态度的优良服务大竞赛，使节约利废、翻改修补工作做出更大的成绩。
