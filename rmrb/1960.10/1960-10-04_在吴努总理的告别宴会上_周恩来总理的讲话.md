At Prime Minister U Nu's Farewell Banquet
Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Your Excellency Prime Minister U Nu, Your Excellency General Ne Win, Esteemed Burmese Guests, Comrades, Friends:

This evening, I am honored to attend the banquet hosted by His Excellency Prime Minister U Nu and once again gather with Burmese guests. I am extremely pleased.

Prime Minister U Nu's visit to our country this time is an extraordinary one. During this visit, the governments of our two countries signed the world-renowned Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, which has aroused widespread reaction throughout the world. Most people cheered it, but a small handful were greatly disappointed. This shows that this treaty has had, and will continue to have, a profound impact. It is conducive to the cause of world peace and unfavorable to aggressors and expansionists. We have done something that is beneficial to China, beneficial to Burma, and beneficial to the world. This is the definitive assessment of fair-minded public opinion around the world, and it is something we should be proud of.

Prime Minister U Nu's visit has also brought us extraordinary friendship. Accompanying him was General Ne Win. They led more than three hundred Burmese friends, bringing us the kinship-like "Pauk-Phaw" affection, which made us feel especially close and greatly encouraged. We also held several friendly and sincere talks, exchanged views on further strengthening Sino-Burmese friendly relations and issues of common concern to both sides, and reached satisfactory consensus. The friendship between the people of China and Burma can withstand the test of time. This is the conclusion drawn by the history of the past ten years. Future practice will also prove that this conclusion is correct.

Dear Burmese friends! Because General Ne Win signed the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression with our country during his visit to our country at the beginning of this year, and because Prime Minister U Nu concluded the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty with our country during this visit, the friendly relations between our two countries, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, will surely develop greatly with the passage of time. Both of our countries are countries that have not long freed themselves from imperialist rule, and both face the solemn task of safeguarding their national independence and building their own countries. The people of both our countries need a peaceful international environment and need friendly cooperation in the economic and cultural fields to facilitate the building of our respective countries into economically prosperous, culturally flourishing, and fully independent nations.

Your Excellency Prime Minister U Nu, Your Excellency General Ne Win, you have always been concerned about the friendship between China and Burma, and it was precisely during your successive terms as Prime Minister of the Union of Burma that the border issue between our two countries was successfully resolved. Your efforts to enhance Sino-Burmese friendship should be written in a big way in the history of Sino-Burmese friendly relations. When you came to China, you brought the deep friendship of the Burmese people towards the Chinese people. Now, as you are about to return to Burma, please bring the friendship of the 650 million Chinese people to the kinsman-like Burmese people. Here, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude once again for your friendly visit.

Tomorrow, His Excellency Prime Minister U Nu and his wife and other Burmese guests will leave Beijing for home. With a feeling of reluctance to part, we wish you good health and happiness on your journey home.

Let us raise our glasses,

To the eternal friendship between China and Burma,
To peace in Asia and the world,
To the health of tonight's host, His Excellency Prime Minister U Nu and his wife,
To the health of His Excellency General Ne Win and his wife,
To the health of all Burmese guests,
To the health of His Excellency U Win Maung, President of the Union of Burma,
Cheers!

    在吴努总理的告别宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的吴努总理阁下，尊敬的奈温将军阁下，尊敬的缅甸贵宾们，同志们，朋友们：
    今天晚上，我荣幸地参加吴努总理阁下举行的宴会，再一次和缅甸贵宾们欢聚一堂，感到非常高兴。
    吴努总理这次来我国的访问，是一次不寻常的访问。在这次访问期间，两国政府签订了举世瞩目的中缅边界条约，在世界范围内引起了广泛的反应，多数人为之欢呼不已，但也有一小撮人大为扫兴。这说明，这个条约已经产生、而且还将继续产生深远的影响。它有利于世界和平事业，而不利于侵略和扩张主义者。我们做了一件有利于中国、有利于缅甸、也有利于世界的事情。这是全世界公正舆论的定评，值得我们庆幸。
    吴努总理这次访问还给我们带来了不寻常的友谊。与他同来访问的还有奈温将军。他们率领了三百多位缅甸朋友，给我们带来了亲戚般的“胞波”感情，使我们感到分外亲切，也得到了极大鼓舞。我们之间还进行了多次友好诚挚的会谈，就进一步加强中缅友好关系和双方共同关心的问题交换了看法，并且令人满意地取得了一致的意见。中缅两国人民的友谊，是经得起考验的，这是十年来历史所作的结论。今后的实践，也将证明这个结论是正确的。
    亲爱的缅甸朋友们！由于奈温将军在今年年初访问我国时同我国签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约，由于吴努总理这次访问同我国缔结了中缅边界条约，我们两国建立在和平共处五项原则基础上的友好关系，今后必将随着岁月的推移而大大地发展起来。我们两国都是摆脱帝国主义统治还不算久的国家，都面临着维护自己民族独立和建设自己国家的庄严任务。我们两国人民都需要一个和平的国际环境，都需要在经济上、文化上进行友好合作，以利于把我们各自的国家建设成为经济繁荣的、文化昌盛的、完全独立的国家。
    吴努总理阁下，奈温将军阁下，你们过去一直是关心中缅两国的友谊，并且正是在你们先后任缅甸联邦总理的期间顺利地解决了我们两国之间的边界问题。你们对增进中缅友好所做的努力，是应该在中缅友好关系史上大书一笔的。你们来到中国的时候，带来了缅甸人民对中国人民的深情厚谊，现在，你们要回到缅甸去的时候，请你们把六亿五千万中国人民的友谊，带给亲戚般的缅甸人民。在此，我谨代表中国人民和中国政府，对你们的友好访问再一次表示衷心的感谢。
    明天，吴努总理阁下和夫人及其他缅甸贵宾将要离开北京回国，我们怀着依依不舍的惜别心情，祝你们在归国途中身体健康，精神愉快。
    让我们举杯，
    为中缅友谊万古长青，
    为亚洲和世界的和平，
    为今天宴会的主人、吴努总理阁下和夫人的健康，
    为奈温将军阁下和夫人的健康，
    为全体缅甸贵宾的健康，
    为缅甸联邦总统吴温貌阁下的健康，
    干杯！
