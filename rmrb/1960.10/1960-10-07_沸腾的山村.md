    Boisterous Mountain Village
    By Our Correspondent Tián Liú
    After the Party Central Committee's call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production in August reached the Dayǒu People's Commune in Wǔxiāng County, Shānxī Province, the Fèngtaípíng Management Area became a scene of great activity.
      The Young People of Fèngtaípíng
    The morning after the Party's call was conveyed, Xiàozhōng was awakened by the sound of footsteps just as the windows began to lighten. "They won't listen to avoiding night work, but they rise before dawn," Xiàozhōng muttered. He quickly jumped out of bed, threw on his clothes, and ran toward the street, intending to stop them. But as he stepped out of the door, the crowd was already almost out of the village, and he only saw the backs of the last few people.
      "Who are they, and what are they doing so early?"
      "Don't shout, Xiàozhōng!" Someone ran back from the group—it was Wèi Gēngshēng, the deputy captain of the First Production Team. "It's almost dawn, hardly early." At this moment, there was also some movement and soft talking in the village. Gēngshēng said, "Listen, people are all getting up." With that, he turned around to chase after his team members. But he had only run a few steps before returning, whispering to Xiàozhōng, "Secretary of the Branch, you must keep it a secret."
    Xiàozhōng looked at this young man who had disappeared into the morning mist in an instant, and felt unspeakable joy in his heart: what a good young man, what a good captain...
      "Director," Xiàozhōng was lost in thought when someone called him from behind. Xiàozhōng was originally the director of the management area, and had only recently been appointed secretary of the branch, so people still often called him Director. Xiàozhōng turned around and saw that it was Dǒng Pūzi, the captain of the Second Production Team, also a valiant general.
      "Where did the First Team go?"
      "Sleeping, of course, who gets up as early as you?" Xiàozhōng said calmly, intending to stop him—Xiàozhōng already had an idea, wanting to turn this reckless and impetuous production team into a skillful team, and catch up with the First Team. Because of this, he had been assigned to supervise this team together with the cadres of the management area since last year. The management area's cadres being assigned to supervise production teams was an old and good experience of theirs, and had been the practice since the agricultural cooperative period. In the production team, they were both "advisors" and members, working together with all the commune members of the production team. In a management area, the busiest were the branch secretary, the management area director, and the accountant, all three of whom worked more than two hundred labor days last year.
    "Don't lie to me," Pūzi said, "If you can't stop the First Team, don't even think about stopping us. Let's go, catch up with them." Before he knew it, all the team members were standing around them. Pūzi said to a team member near him, "Go tell the canteen to deliver breakfast and lunch to the fields, we won't be back to eat."
    Xiàozhōng went home to get an iron shovel and set off with Pūzi and the others.
    A campaign for increased production and saving centered on autumn field management and wheat preparation work thus began. The four production teams in the entire management area launched a heated competition on the vast fields. Women, children, and elderly commune members fertilized and weeded the autumn crops and removed diseased plants. Young men plowed the wheat fields and built field ridges. When the Third Production Team saw that the First and Second Teams started work earlier than them, they became anxious and made a good division of labor for all the team members according to their specialties and physical strength: women weeded, men carried manure, and children applied fertilizer. The old commune member Wèi Yáoběi, who was good at storytelling and impromptu rhyming, was originally assigned to weed, but he refused, insisting on carrying manure like the young men. He said, "This old man is fifty-three, personally signed up to carry manure. Youngsters carry twelve loads, I want to carry twenty-three." Sure enough, he carried twenty-three loads that day, not one load less than the young people. On this day, the Second Team did the best in building field ridges, building two more *zhàng* than the First Team. A difference of two *zhàng* was originally not a significant difference, but in the eyes of this group of young people chasing each other, it was simply a huge deal—no wonder the members of the First Team were anxious. Their production team was famous not only in the Fèngtaípíng Management Area, not only in the Dayǒu People's Commune, but also in the entire province of Shānxī, and was known as the "Tàiháng Red Flag Production Team." This spring, the CPC Southeast Shānxī Prefectural Committee issued a call to the entire prefecture, calling on all commune members to learn from them. Now they were surpassed by the Second Team, how could they accept this! At dinner time, the team members asked Gēngshēng one after another:
    "What do we do, we're behind the Second Team?"
    "The Red Flag is moving."
    "Catch up with them tomorrow."
    "Tomorrow? Today they pulled us back two *zhàng*, why can't they pull us back another two *zhàng* tomorrow?"
    "So we admit defeat?"
    "Who said admit defeat? Think of a way!"
    The members of the Second Team were no calmer than the people of the First Team, and they were also discussing:
    "We can't let them catch up!"
      "While their captain is away at a conference in the prefecture, leave them far behind."
      "Tomorrow, we'll surpass them by ten *zhàng*."
      "Go, go, go, go to bed quickly after dinner," said Dǒng Pūzi, the captain of the Second Team, "Don't just put your energy into talking."
    The team members looked at Pūzi's face and said nothing—they could tell at a glance that the captain already had some "brilliant plan."
      "Strategist" and "Shepherd"
    Dǒng Pūzi was originally a reckless and impetuous go-getter. In the past two years, with the direct help of branch secretary Yáng Xiàozhōng, he had more and more working methods and became a resourceful person. He usually put a lot of thought into his work and often unexpectedly came up with clever ways to leave other teams behind. This spring, the Party called for expanding the cultivated area and planting more and harvesting more. After the meeting, the First Team set off to reclaim wasteland, but Pūzi told his team members to weed the fields, and he went silently to find the "shepherd" Wèi Mèngsōng to "chat idly." The team members were very anxious, and some even complained that he was "not implementing the Party's instructions," but by the evening people understood that their captain had gone to the "shepherd" to find out where there was wasteland that could be reclaimed. The "shepherd" led the sheep up the mountains and down the valleys all year round, and was most familiar with the land conditions around the village. Wèi Mèngsōng was an old "shepherd" who had grazed sheep for more than twenty years, and he knew the hills and gullies like the back of his hand. The next day, according to the information Dǒng Pūzi learned from the "shepherd," he led all the team members and reclaimed more than sixty *mǔ* of good wasteland in one day, and planted it all with black beans. The land they reclaimed in one day was more than the First Team reclaimed in two days. From then on, the team members gave their captain a nickname, calling him "Strategist." When other teams talked about Dǒng Pūzi, they also said that he was someone who "doesn't talk much, but has big plans in his heart."
    After dinner, the team members all went home to sleep, but Dǒng Pūzi stopped deputy captain Zhāng Jùnshēng: "Tonight, the sheep flock will fertilize our team's land, let's go watch the sheep together."
    Which production team's land the sheep flock fertilizes, that production team is responsible for watching the sheep at night, allowing the shepherd to go home to rest. This is a new system established during the agricultural cooperative era. In the past, shepherds were always with the sheep flock all year round. During the day, the sheep went up the high mountains and the people went up the high mountains, the sheep went down to the river beaches and the people went down to the river beaches. At night, the sheep were in the wilderness and the people were also in the wilderness. The sheep slept, but the people kept watch by their side. After the cooperative movement, the peasants were liberated from the shackles of private ownership, and the shepherds were also liberated. They were no longer the slaves of landlords and rich peasants, but became the masters of the agricultural cooperatives and people's communes, becoming the masters of managing their own property. The commune members were connected heart to heart. In addition to doing everything possible to graze the sheep flock well, the shepherding commune members also drove the sheep flock to the fields every night to fertilize the agricultural production. The commune members engaged in agricultural production were even more concerned about the "shepherds," and in order to allow them to recover from the fatigue of grazing the sheep flock up and down the mountains during the day, they replaced the "shepherds" every night, allowing them to go home and rest well and keep watch over the sheep flock for them. With everyone's joint efforts, the sheep flock in the Fèngtaípíng Management Area increased from more than 300 before collectivization to more than 580, and after selling 150, there were still more than 430.
    After the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward that agriculture is the foundation of national economic development, and the call for the whole Party and the whole people to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production reached the Dayǒu Commune, the shepherds responded even more enthusiastically. At the commune member meeting to discuss how to carry out the increased production and conservation campaign, the shepherd Wèi Sānzé and six others quietly held a small meeting, and then stood up and said:
    "We shepherds wholeheartedly support vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. In order to respond to the Party's call, we have decided to select three people to participate in agricultural production, and the remaining four people will graze these more than 400 sheep, and also ensure that the sheep are grazed even better..."
    All the commune members applauded enthusiastically, and many people praised "the shepherds have taken the lead." Sānzé then continued:
    "We also guarantee that the sheep flock will not damage a single crop, and guarantee to fertilize the wheat fields well."
    Wèi Sānzé was a man of his word. He honorably joined the Communist Party as early as 1938, and was elected as a branch committee member in 1945. In 1952, when the primary agricultural cooperative was first established, more than 180 of the cooperative's 300 sheep died due to the sabotage of the landlords. In order to reverse this situation, the Party branch sent him to graze and manage the sheep flock, and by 1955 the sheep flock had recovered to about 300. When Dǒng Pūzi and Zhāng Jùnshēng came to replace them and let them go home to rest, they unexpectedly saw Wèi Sānzé and another shepherd Zhāng Hǔjiāng building field ridges in the afterglow of the setting sun. This made Dǒng Pūzi and the two of them very happy. Jùnshēng smiled and said to Pūzi: "They thought of the same thing as us."
    That night, Xiàozhōng finished the branch meeting, and although it was late, he still didn't want to sleep. He wanted to check if anyone had violated the decision of the management committee and was secretly working at night. He had said so many times about this matter at large and small meetings, and had done so much individual persuasion work, but people always said to him: "The season waits for no one, you have to be busy when you should be busy"; and they also said: "In the old society, when we were long-term laborers for the landlords, which day didn't we work sixteen or seventeen hours, but now we're working for ourselves and we have to stop at eight o'clock, it's really incomprehensible." Whenever people said this to him, he couldn't bear to force them back - he himself was someone who had been a long-term laborer for the landlords since he was a child. Later, he had no choice but to stipulate that no one could violate the policy of combining work and rest, and that at least eight hours of sleep per day must be guaranteed. In order to implement the Party's decision, he walked almost every night to the high ridge north of the village to listen to whether anyone was secretly working in the surrounding fields. On this day, as soon as he climbed the ridge, he heard the sound of building field ridges from afar. Xiàozhōng quickly ran towards the sound.
    "You are violating the policy again," Xiàozhōng shouted loudly from afar before he could see who it was, "I've told you so many times, you never listen."
    "Xiàozhōng, you've wronged us this time, watching the sheep and building field ridges at night doesn't count as working overtime," said Zhāng Jùnshēng, who liked to joke: "There are endless superiorities to it! First, you don't get sleepy, second, it can ward off the cold, third, the sound of building field ridges scares away wolves from stealing sheep, and fourth, you can leave the First Team even further behind..."
      They Are Also Young People
    The next morning, the news that Dǒng Pūzi was watching sheep and building field ridges at night, and that the shepherds Wèi Sānzé and Zhāng Hǔjiāng were helping to build field ridges spread throughout the entire management area. Not only were the young men of the First Production Team jumping with anxiety, but it also alarmed the two "Chicken Official Masters" of the chicken and rabbit farm. These two, in terms of age, could match three young men, one named Ní Gēngquán, seventy-two years old; one named Yáng Cúnyǒu, sixty-nine years old. But neither of them admitted to being old—that is, they were not old, their hearts were not old, and they were also hale and hearty, except for doing farm work that required a lot of strength, they could do anything else. Last year, the seventy-two-year-old Ní Gēngquán also worked 190 labor days. After the commune conveyed the Party's call for increased production and conservation this time, the two
  "Chicken Official Masters" also proposed to return to the production team to work. Not only did Xiàozhōng disagree with their request, but even the commune members opposed it, and said to them: "If you propose to return to the production team to work again, we won't even let you manage the chicken farm anymore, just go to the nursing home and enjoy your life," only then was the problem solved.
    "Hey, always saying old, always saying old..." Old Man Yáng sighed as he walked back to the chicken farm after the meeting.
      "What are you humming about," Old Man Ní said, "If we can't say it directly, we can do it secretly!" Then, he told his plan: to reclaim the barren slope next to the chicken farm and plant vegetables, "If we can't add *jīn*, can't we add *liǎng*?"
    From that day on, in addition to feeding chickens and rabbits, the two old men started planting vegetable gardens whenever they had time. After hearing about the shepherds' deeds this day, the two old men secretly redoubled their efforts. They carefully swept up the chicken manure and rabbit manure and applied it to the land. You caught insects, I pulled weeds, and they really turned the barren slope next to the chicken and rabbit farm into a vegetable garden.
    On the third day, the First Production Team was the first to complete the task of late-stage processing of autumn crops: universally hoeing the grass again, and applying a second fertilization—20 *dàn* of fertilizer per *mǔ* in the high-yield square, and 30 *dàn* in the general fields... Other production teams, some in three days and one morning, some in three and a half days, and the latest in four days, also completed these tasks. And they started the winter wheat sowing work five days before the White Dew Festival. It only took eight days to complete—no, it should be said that they overfulfilled the winter wheat sowing plan. When the plan was made in the spring, they planned to plant 200 *mǔ* of winter wheat this year, but actually planted 250 *mǔ*. The warm autumn breeze of September turned the wheat fields green, and the tall corn and heavy ears of grain were painted golden yellow.
    The harvest season has begun.

    沸腾的山村
    本报记者　田流
    8月，党中央发出的大办农业、大办粮食的号召传到山西省武乡县大有人民公社以后，凤台坪管理区沸腾起来了。
      凤台坪的青年人
    传达了党的号召的第二天早晨，窗户刚刚发白，效忠就被嚓嚓的脚步声惊醒了。“不叫开夜车他们却起五更”，效忠叨念着。他赶紧跳下床来，一边穿衣服一边向街上跑去，准备把人们拦回来。可是当他走出门，人群已经快出村了，只看到了走在最后边的几个人的背影。
      “那是谁们，这样早干什么去。”
      “别嚷么，效忠！”队伍里跑回来一个人——原来是魏更生，第一生产队的副队长，“天都要亮了，还早什么。”这时，村里又有什在走动，在小声儿说话，更生说，“听，人们都起来了。”说罢，扭转身追他的队员们去了。可刚刚跑了不几步又返回来，小声向效忠说：“支部书记，可要保守秘密啊。”
    效忠看着这个转眼就消失在晨雾中的青年，心里说不出的高兴：多好的青年，多好的队长啊……
      “主任，”效忠正在出神，忽然背后有人叫他。效忠原来是管理区主任，不久前才担任支部书记的，所以人们还常叫他主任。效忠回头看时，原来是第二生产队队长董扑子，也是一员虎将。
      “一队哪里去了？”
      “睡觉哩嘛，谁像你起的这样早。”效忠平静地说，想把他拦回去——效忠早有主意，想把这个猛打猛冲的生产队变成巧干队，追上一队。就因为这，从去年开始，他就同管理区的干部们分工包了这个队。管理区的干部分工包干生产队，是他们的一个老经验，也是一个好经验，从农业社时期开始就一直这样作。他们在生产队既是“参谋”，又是队员，和生产队全体社员一块劳动。在一个管理区，最忙的要算支部书记、管理区主任和会计了，他们三人在去年都作了二百个以上的劳动日。
    “你别骗我，”扑子说，“拦不住一队，更别想拦住我们。走，赶他们去。”不知什么时候，全体队员已经站在他们周围，扑子对他近旁的一个队员说，“去告诉食堂，早饭午饭都送到地里去，不回来吃了。”
    效忠回家拿了一把铁锨，和扑子他们一同出发了。
    一个以秋田管理和种麦准备工作为中心的增产节约运动就这样开始了。全管理区四个生产队在广大的田野上展开了热烈的竞赛，妇女、儿童和老年社员给大秋作物追肥、锄草、拔除病株，年青小伙子们耕翻麦地、打地埂。第三生产队见一、二队比他们出工早，着了急，把全队的队员按照各人的特长和劳力强弱，作了很好的分工：妇女锄草，男人担粪，儿童追肥。好说快板、出口成章的老社员魏尧北本来被分配去锄草的，可是他不干，非要和年青小伙子一样去担粪不可，他说：“我老汉五十三，亲自报名把粪担，后生挑上十二担，我要担它二十三。”果然这一天担了二十三担，比青年人一担不少。这一天打地埂数二队成绩大，比第一队还多打了两丈。两丈之差，本来不是什么了不得的差别，可是在这群互相追赶着的青年人看来，简直是件天大的事情——也难怪一队的队员们着急，他们生产队不只在凤台坪管理区，也不只在大有人民公社，在山西全省也是有名的，被誉为“太行红旗生产队”，今年春天，中共晋东南地委向全专区发出了号召，号召全体公社社员向他们学习，如今竟被二队超过去了，这怎么得了呢！吃晚饭的时候，队员们纷纷问更生：
    “怎么办呢，拉在二队后面了？”
    “红旗要搬家了。”
    “明天赶他们。”
    “明天？今天叫人家拉下二丈，明天为啥不能再拉咱二丈？”
    “那就认输了？”
    “谁说认输了？想办法嘛！”
    二队的队员并不比一队的人们平静，他们也在纷纷议论：
    “可不能叫他们赶上！”
      “趁他们队长去专区开会的机会，把他们远远地拉在后面。”
      “明天要超他十丈。”
      “去去去，吃罢饭快睡觉去，”二队队长董扑子说，“把劲别光用在嘴上。”
    队员们看看扑子的脸，都不说话了——他们一看就知道，队长已经又有了什么“妙计”。
      “谋臣”和“羊倌”
    董扑子本来是个猛打猛冲的闯将，这两年在支部书记杨效忠的直接帮助下，工作办法越来越多了，成了个智勇双全的人，平常干工作很好动脑筋，常常出其不意地想出个妙法把别的队拉在后面。今年春天，党号召扩大耕地面积，多种多收。一队开罢会全队人马就出发开荒去了，扑子却叫他的队员们去田里除草，自己一声不吭地去找“羊倌”魏梦松“拉闲天”去了。队员们很着急，还有的埋怨他“不执行党的指示”，可是到晚上人们就明白了，原来他们的队长是向“羊倌”调查哪里有可开垦的荒地去了。“羊倌”成年领着羊群爬坡上山，对村庄远近的土地情形最熟悉，魏梦松又是放了二十多年羊的老“羊倌”，对坡坡沟沟更是了如指掌。第二天，董扑子根据向“羊倌”了解的情况，领着全体队员，一天就开了六十多亩好荒地，并全部种上了黑豆。他们一天开的地，比一队两天开的还多。从那以后，队员们给他们的队长起了一个外号，叫作“谋臣”，其他的队一谈起董扑子的时候，也说他是个“嘴里不说话，心里安排大”的人。
    吃过晚饭，队员们都回家睡觉去了，董扑子却叫住副队长张俊生：“今晚羊群给咱队卧地，咱俩一块看羊去吧。”
    给哪个生产队卧粪，哪个生产队晚上便替羊工看羊，让羊工回家休息，这是农业社时代建立起来的新制度。过去，羊工一年到头总是和羊群在一起，白天，羊上高山人上高山，羊下河滩人也下河滩；晚上，羊在荒野人也在荒野，羊群睡了觉人却在旁守夜。合作化以后，农民从私有制的束缚下解放了，羊工也解放了，他们再不是地主老财的奴隶，变成农业社、人民公社的主人了，成了管理自己财产的主人了。社员们是心连心的。牧羊的社员除了千方百计地把羊群牧放好以外，天天夜里还把羊群赶到地里，给农业生产卧粪；搞农业生产的社员更是对“羊倌”关心备至，为了让他们恢复白天上山下岭牧放羊群的疲劳，天天晚上把“羊倌”换回来，让他们回家好好休息，替他们守夜看羊群。在大家共同努力下，凤台坪管理区的羊群由公社化前的三百多只，增加到五百八十多只，卖出一百五十只以外，仍有四百三十多只。
    党中央和毛主席提出的农业是国民经济发展的基础，全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的号召到达大有公社以后，羊工们更是热烈响应，在讨论如何开展增产节约运动的社员大会上，羊工魏三则和其他六个人悄悄地开了个小会，然后站起来说：
    “我们羊工对大办农业、大办粮食双手拥护，为了响应党的号召，我们决定抽出三个人参加农业生产，剩下四个人放这四百多只羊，还保证把羊放得更好……”
    全体社员一阵热烈的鼓掌，好些人还称赞“羊工打了头炮”，三则又接着说：
    “我们还保证不让羊群糟踏一棵庄稼，保证给种麦地卧好粪。”
    魏三则是个说到做到的人。他远在1938年便光荣地参加了共产党，1945年又被选为支部委员。1952年刚成立初级农业社时，因为地主的破坏，社里三百来只羊倒死了一百八十多只，为了扭转这个情况，党支部派他放牧和管理羊群，到1955年羊群又恢复到了三百只左右。当董扑子和张俊生来换他们回家休息的时候，竟看到魏三则和另一个羊工张虎江在落日的余辉中打地埂，这下可把董扑子二人乐坏了，俊生笑着向扑子说：“他们跟咱想到一条道儿上来了。”
    这天夜里，效忠开完支部会议，虽然天气不早了，可仍不想睡觉，他要检查一下，看是不是有人违背管理委员会的决议，在夜里偷偷的干活。为这件事，他不知在大会小会上说过多少次，也不知作过多少次个别说服工作，可人们总是向他说：“季节不等人，该忙的时候就得忙些”；还说：“旧社会给地主扛长工时，哪天不干十六、七个钟头，如今给自己劳动倒要八点钟，真叫人想不通。”每逢人们这样向他说时，他就再也不能忍心把人们硬拉回来——他自己就是个从小就给地主作长工的人啊。后来，只好规定谁也不能违背劳逸结合政策，一天至少保证有八个钟头的睡眠。为了贯彻党的决定，差不多天天夜晚他都走上村北那架高圪梁，听听四野里有没有人在偷着干活。这天，他刚登上圪梁，就听见乒乒乓乓的打地埂的声音从远方传来。效忠赶紧朝着声音跑去。
    “你们又违背政策啦，”效忠还没有看清是谁，老远就大声嚷起来，“说了多少回，你们总是不听。”
    “效忠，这回你可错怪我们了，看羊守夜打打地埂可不算加班加点，”爱开玩笑的张俊生说：“还有说不完的优越性呢！第一不瞌睡，第二能驱寒，第三打地埂乒乓一响狼不前来偷羊吃，第四嘛，还能把第一队拉的更远些……”
      他们也是青年人
    第二天大清早，董扑子夜晚看羊打地埂，羊工魏三则、张虎江帮助打地埂的事便传遍了全管理区，不光是第一生产队的小伙子们急得乱蹦乱跳，还惊动了鸡兔场的两位“鸡倌大人”。这两位，论年纪，谁也能抵上三个年青小伙子，一位叫倪更全，七十二岁；一位叫杨存有，六十九岁。可是谁也不服老——也就是不老，心不老，人也硬朗，除了担担挑挑出大力气的农活以外，别的都能干。去年，七十二岁的倪更全老汉还作了一百九十个劳动日呢。这次，公社传达党的增产节约号召以后，两位
  “鸡倌大人”又提出了回生产队劳动的要求。对于他们的要求，不光效忠不同意，连社员们都反对，并且对他们说：“要再提回生产队劳动，连鸡场也不叫管了，干脆到敬老院享清福去”，这才算解决了问题。
    “唉，硬说老、硬说老……”杨老汉在散会后回鸡场的路上直叹气。
      “你哼哼啥呢，”倪老汉说，“明说不行，咱可以暗干嘛！”接着，他说出了自己的计划：把鸡场旁边那块荒坡开出来，种上菜，“咱添不了斤，还增不了两？”
    从那天起，两位老人除了喂鸡、喂兔以外，一有空就种起菜园来。这天听说羊工的事以后，两个老汉更暗中加了劲，他们细心地把鸡粪、兔粪扫起来，施到地里，你捉虫，我拔草，真个的把鸡兔场旁边的荒坡变成了菜园。
    第三天，第一生产队首先完成了大秋作物后期加工的任务：普遍又锄了一遍草，加施了一次追肥——丰产方每亩施追肥二十担，一般田施了三十担……。其他生产队有的三天零一早晨，有的三天半，最迟的四天，也完成了这些任务。并在白露节前五天开始了冬麦播种工作。只用了八天的时间，便完成——不，应该说是超额完成了冬麦播种计划，春天拟定计划时，今年准备种二百亩冬麦，实际上种了二百
  五十亩。9月的温暖的秋风，吹绿了麦田，而高大的玉茭和沉甸甸的谷穗都涂上了金黄色。
    秋收的季节开始了。
