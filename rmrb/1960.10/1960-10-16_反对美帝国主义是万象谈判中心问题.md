Opposing U.S. Imperialism Is the Central Issue of the Vientiane Negotiations

Vientiane Radio Refutes the Proposal to Have the Lao Government Negotiate with the Nosavan Group

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 14th: Lao Battle Forces Radio Station published a commentary today pointing out that the most central issue in the current negotiations between the Lao Patriotic Front delegation and the Royal Government delegation should be how to jointly oppose the main enemies of the Lao nation, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in Laos.

The commentary said: Our people clearly see that the Lao Patriotic Front has always stood on its firm and unwavering position. This is: to be loyal to the supreme interests of the nation, to care about the destiny of the country and the interests of the people, and to hope that Laos becomes a truly peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified and prosperous country.

The commentary pointed out that the current negotiations with the Royal Government have begun in a particularly cordial and mutually understanding atmosphere. The commentary said: This enthusiasm and sincerity on both sides in the negotiations is welcome. However, our people believe that in order for the negotiations to achieve good results, it is necessary to proceed from the current actual situation in our country to solve key issues. At present, the interference of U.S. imperialism and the treasonous activities of Phoumi Nosavan are the most serious threats to our country. They deliberately obstruct the realization of peace, neutrality and national harmony in Laos, they are doing everything possible to undermine the negotiations, and conspiring to force the government to make concessions to them. They have sent some commanders of the First and Second Military Regions to pretend to be loyal to the government, but they continue to conduct mopping-up operations and provoke the Lao Battle Forces, attempting to create misunderstandings between the government and the Lao Battle Forces.

The commentary said: Therefore, the current task of the Lao nation is: to concentrate all forces to smash the forces and activities of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism. This is the urgent task of the Lao nation, and it is also the key issue in the negotiations between the Royal Government and the Lao Battle Forces. Both parties who are responsible for the destiny of the nation must see this as their task. Our people believe that in order to accomplish the above tasks, both sides must unanimously recognize that the main enemies of the nation are U.S. imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan group, and the key issue is that their forces and conspiracies must be smashed.

The commentary said: To do this, the first step is to strive to unite all national forces and direct the spearhead at the main enemy.

The commentary concluded: The people are ready to support all efforts made by the Phouma government and the Lao Patriotic Front in the negotiations in the above-mentioned direction.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 15th: Vientiane Radio refuted the proposal for "negotiations" with the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group in a commentary published on the 14th.

The commentary mentioned that some people intend to suggest that the King convene a meeting of the heads of the three "factions," namely Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma, Lao Patriotic Front leader Prince Souphanouvong, and Prince Boun Oum Na Champassak (head of the so-called "Revolutionary Committee" established by the Phoumi Nosavan group), "to restore the harmony of the three factions."

The commentary said, "We believe that this kind of negotiation will not bring any results, and it is too late to conduct such negotiations now. Because the strengths of the three factions are too far apart. At the same time, we must pay attention to the wishes of the people, who are unwilling to negotiate with Savannakhet (where the Phoumi Nosavan group's headquarters are located). What does that so-called 'Revolutionary Committee' represent? It can never be compared to a legitimate government or a faction supported by millions of people, because it has not brought any benefits to the people, and has not been loved by the people. The 'Revolutionary Committee' of Savannakhet cannot represent anyone. If they put forward any demands for negotiations, the purpose is only to find a way out of the quagmire they have fallen into."

The commentary recalled that after Prince Souvanna Phouma gained the trust of the National Assembly and took control of the leadership of the country, he once called on the Phoumi Nosavan group to negotiate, but they did not respond, because they thought they were very strong and someone was supporting them.

The commentary pointed out, "What Phoumi Nosavan has done has only brought suffering to the people, so how can the people agree to let him serve as an important official in the government, and how can Prince Souphanouvong agree to sit with him? Because Phoumi Nosavan once betrayed the Vientiane Agreement, and he is responsible for the arrest and imprisonment of the Lao Patriotic Front's leaders."

The commentary said, "In the current situation, the Savannakhet group has only one way out, which is to announce the dissolution of the 'Revolutionary Committee' and return to being good citizens." The commentary believes that if this can be done, "the Lao people can still treat them with leniency."

### 反对美帝国主义是万象谈判中心问题

    寮国战斗部队电台发表评论
    反对美帝国主义是万象谈判中心问题
    万象电台驳斥要老挝政府同诺萨万集团谈判的主张
    据新华社河内14日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天发表评论指出，目前老挝爱国战线党代表团同王国政府代表团之间谈判的最中心问题，应当是如何共同反对老挝民族的主要敌人美帝国主义及其在老挝的走狗。
    评论说：我国人民清楚地看到，老挝爱国战线党一向站在它的坚定不移的立场上。这就是：忠于民族的最高利益，关心国家的命运和人民的利益，希望老挝成为真正和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的国家。
    评论指出，目前同王国政府的谈判是在特别亲切和互相谅解的气氛中开始进行的。评论说：双方在谈判中的这种热情和诚意是值得欢迎的。但是，我国人民认为，要使谈判获得良好成果的话，必须根据我国当前的实际情况出发，来解决带有关键性的问题。就目前来说，美帝国主义的干涉和富米·诺萨万的叛国活动，是对我国的最严重的威胁。它们蓄意阻挠实现老挝的和平、中立和民族的和睦，它们正在千方百计地破坏谈判，阴谋迫使政府向他们让步。他们派第一军区和第二军区的一些指挥官假装忠诚于政府，却继续进行扫荡，向寮国战斗部队挑衅，企图制造政府和寮国战斗部队之间的误会。
    评论说：因此，老挝民族当前的任务是：集中一切力量，来粉碎美帝国主义的走狗富米·诺萨万叛国集团的势力和活动。这是老挝民族的迫切任务，同时也是王国政府和寮国战斗部队的谈判的关键性问题。对民族的命运负有责任的双方必须看到这是自己的任务。我国人民认为，为了完成上述任务，双方必须一致承认，民族的主要敌人是美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万集团，关键问题是必须粉碎它们的势力和阴谋。
    评论说：要做到这样，首先就要努力设法团结一切民族力量，把锋芒指向主要的敌人。
    评论最后说：人民随时准备支持富马政府和老挝爱国战线党本着上述的方向进行的谈判的一切努力。
    新华社河内15日电　万象电台在14日发表的一篇评论中驳斥了那种同富米·诺萨万叛乱集团“谈判”的主张。
    评论提到，有的人打算建议国王召开三个“派系”的首脑的会议，就是政府首相梭发那·富马亲王、老挝爱国战线党领袖苏发努冯亲王和文翁·纳占巴塞亲王（富米·诺萨万集团建立的所谓“革命委员会”的首脑）之间的会议，“以恢复三个派系的和好”。
    评论说，“我们认为这种谈判不会带来什么结果，而现在进行这种谈判也太晚了。因为三个派系的力量相差得太远。同时，必须注意人民的愿望，人民不愿意同沙湾拿吉（富米·诺萨万集团总部所在地）谈判，那个所谓‘革命委员会’代表什么呢？它绝不能同合法的政府或者同一个得到成百万人支持的派系相比，因为它没有给人民带来任何利益，没有得到人民的爱戴。沙湾拿吉的‘革命委员会’不能代表任何人。如果它们提出什么谈判的要求，目的只不过是为了寻找摆脱它们已经陷入的泥坑的出路。”
    评论回顾说，梭发那·富马亲王在得到国会的信任、掌握了国家领导权之后，曾经呼吁富米·诺萨万集团进行谈判，但是它们没有答复，因为它们自以为很强大，而且有人支持它们。
    评论指出，“富米·诺萨万的所作所为，只给人民带来苦难，这样，人民怎能同意让他担任政府的重要官员，而且苏发努冯亲王怎能同意同他坐在一起呢？因为富米·诺萨万曾经背弃万象协议，他对逮捕和监禁老挝爱国战线党的负责人的行动负有责任。”
    评论说，“在当前形势下，沙湾拿吉集团只有一条出路，就是宣布解散‘革命委员会’，回头作个好公民。”评论认为，如果能够作到这点，“老挝人民尚可以用宽大政策对待它们”。
