    Old Heroes, New Achievements
    Chen Xiaofa (right), a famous steelmaking expert and deputy director of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, and Li Shaokui (left), deputy director of the open hearth furnace workshop, recently worked with workers to overcome the "furnace refining hurdle," creating a new set of operating methods. Adopting this new operating method can ensure high furnace refining efficiency, good quality, and long service life, enabling each open hearth furnace to increase steelmaking time by an average of more than ten hours per month.

    The Ma Wanshui team of the Hebei Longyan Iron and Steel Company's Tunneling Engineering Company, a national mining tunneling red banner and the holder of twelve national rapid tunneling records in the past ten years, has completed its annual plan 119 days ahead of schedule this year. Ma Wanshui (third from right), now the deputy manager of the Tunneling Engineering Company, often goes deep into this team for guidance and assistance. Here, Ma Wanshui is studying with team leader Guo Jincai (first from left) and others to improve the efficiency of the pneumatic drill and conduct deep-hole blasting in preparation for creating even higher records.

    Wang Fengen, an engineer from the Shenyang Transformer Factory who started as a worker, recently worked with workers in the insulation workshop to successfully develop a high-efficiency multi-knife cutting machine. Using it to cut insulation cardboard is fourteen times more efficient than in the past. He is adjusting the knives of the multi-knife cutting machine.

    Since the beginning of this year, the Qi Hezhi Youth Rapid Tunneling Team of the Chenjiazhuang Coal Mine in Hebi City, Henan Province, has successively created and promoted more than ten new machines and dozens of new technologies, realizing mechanized tunneling and continuously creating new national records of more than 2,000 meters of monthly tunneling progress. Here, Qi Hezhi is using a machine he made to saw pit props. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Bingwen.
    Huang Rongchang (left in the circular image), a nationally renowned model worker and deputy chief engineer of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company who started as a carpenter, designed and manufactured a Jiangbian scissor-type crane with workers and technicians in the battle to seize high steel production, greatly shortening the loading and unloading time of steel and other materials.
