Xinhua News Agency, October 10th dispatch from Salisbury: In Gwelo, an industrial city southwest of Salisbury, Africans launched a struggle against colonial rule on the 9th. This follows the struggle launched by Africans in Harare Township, a suburb of Salisbury, on the 8th against the colonialists. In this new incident, Africans attacked colonialist cars with stones and set fire to colonialist cars and some buildings.

It is reported that this incident was caused by colonial police disrupting a rally held by the Southern Rhodesia National Democratic Party in Gwelo on the same day and using tear gas to suppress the Africans who attended the rally. News said that the British colonial authorities have summoned their special police in Gwelo to prepare for further suppression of Africans.

On the same day, in another African township, Highfield, in the suburbs of Salisbury, when the colonialists refused an African to enter a bar, a group of Africans rose up against this racial discrimination and angrily smashed the bar. News said that the colonial police there also suppressed the Africans.

Xinhua News Agency, October 9th dispatch from Salisbury: Africans in Harare Township, a suburb of Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia, had a fierce struggle with the British colonial authorities last night.

It is reported that this struggle was caused by a white man's car killing an African cyclist.

The white man's barbaric behavior aroused great indignation among the Africans, who threw stones at the police and colonial authorities' vehicles that came to suppress them, and burned down the beer hall run by the colonial authorities and the shops around it. They also surrounded the fuel depot owned by the white man.

It is reported that the colonial police fired tear gas and opened fire on the Africans. It is reported that in this struggle, seven Africans were shot dead by the police, sixty to seventy were injured, and about one hundred were illegally arrested.

Xinhua News Agency, October 11th dispatch from Bulawayo: The struggle of the people of Southern Rhodesia against colonialism and for the right to survival is expanding. On the 10th, in Bulawayo, the industrial and commercial center of Southern Rhodesia, African workers held a large-scale strike demanding wage increases. As many as two thousand people participated.

On the morning of this day, all the African employees of the local bus company first launched a strike. Soon, the strike wave immediately spread to other industrial sectors. It is reported that all the African workers in at least nine factories have joined this strike.

News said that as early as the 8th, African workers at a local dairy factory held a strike demanding wage increases.

It is reported that the British colonial authorities have summoned a large number of police reserves to prepare to suppress the Africans.

In Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia, and Gwelo, an industrial city, the situation is still very tense. A large number of colonial police are constantly patrolling and suppressing. The British colonial authorities opened fire on demonstrators in Gwelo at midnight on the 9th, injuring three Africans and arresting four.

    反对英国殖民当局的残暴统治和镇压
    南罗得西亚人民奋起展开斗争
    布拉瓦约二千非洲工人罢工要求增加工资
    据新华社10日讯　索耳兹伯里消息：在索耳兹伯里西南的工业城市格韦洛9日爆发了非洲人反对殖民统治的斗争。这是继索耳兹伯里近郊哈拉尔镇的非洲人8日展开反对殖民者的斗争以后的又一次爆发。在这次新的事件中，非洲人用石块袭击殖民者的汽车，并放火烧毁了殖民者的汽车和一些建筑物。
    据报道，这次事件是由于殖民警察当天破坏了南罗得西亚民族民主党在格韦洛召开的一次集会，并且用催泪瓦斯镇压参加集会的非洲人而引起的。消息说，英国殖民当局已经召集了它在格韦洛的特别警察，准备进一步镇压非洲人。
    同一天，在索耳兹伯里近郊的另一个非洲人市镇海菲尔德，当殖民者不准一个非洲人进入一家酒吧间时，一群非洲人奋起反对这种种族歧视，并愤怒地捣毁了这家酒吧间。消息说，那里的殖民警察也对非洲人进行了镇压。
    据新华社9日讯　索耳兹伯里消息：南罗得西亚首府索耳兹伯里近郊哈拉尔镇的非洲人，昨晚和英国殖民当局发生了激烈的斗争。
    据报道，这次斗争是由于一个白种人的汽车撞死了一个骑自行车的非洲人引起的。
    白人的野蛮行为激起了非洲人的极大愤慨，他们向赶来镇压的警察和殖民当局的车辆投掷石块，并烧毁了殖民当局经营的啤酒馆和它周围的商店。他们还包围了白种人所有的燃料库。
    据报道，殖民警察向非洲人施放催泪瓦斯并开枪。据报道，在这次斗争中，有七名非洲人被警察开枪打死，六七十人受伤，约一百人被非法逮捕。
    新华社11日讯　布拉瓦约消息：南罗得西亚人民反对殖民主义和争取生存权利的斗争在扩大中。10日，在南罗得西亚工商业中心城市布拉瓦约，非洲工人举行了要求增加工资的大罢工。参加者达两千人。
    这天上午，那里的公共汽车公司的全体非洲职工首先展开了罢工斗争。不久，罢工浪潮立即扩大到其他工业部门。据报道，至少有九个工厂的全部非洲工人已经投入了这一罢工斗争。
    消息说，早在8日，那里的一家牛奶厂的非洲工人曾举行罢工要求增加工资。
    据报道，英国殖民当局召集了大批警察后备队准备对非洲人进行镇压。
    在南罗得西亚首府索耳兹伯里和工业城市格韦洛，局势仍然十分紧张。大批的殖民警察在不停地进行巡逻和镇压。英国殖民当局9日午夜曾在格韦洛向示威群众开枪，有三名非洲人被打伤，有四名被捕。
