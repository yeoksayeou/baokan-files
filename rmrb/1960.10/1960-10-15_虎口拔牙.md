    Snatching Teeth from the Tiger's Mouth
    Major General Zeng Yongya
    (I)
    In 1948, while the troops were still in the midst of summer training, Commander Lin was already planning a major campaign. The specific details of this plan were unknown to anyone at the time.
    On September 11th, our 25th Division was ordered to cross the Daling River with extreme secrecy and speed, and in coordination with the 4th Column, suddenly surrounded Yixian. We were then ordered to hand over the task of besieging the city to the 3rd Column, and the troops headed south to prepare to fight off reinforcements. Soon after, the troops turned southwest again, traveling day and night to gather near Da and Xiao Yejiatun, northwest of Jinzhou, awaiting orders. Along the way, we saw many troops moving east and west with frequent transfers, and artillery vehicles and mules coming and going in an endless stream. Several leading cadres of our division privately discussed that a major battle action had likely already begun.
    On the 24th, just before dawn, I was awakened by a "Report!" from the head of the Cipher Section, Qiao Zun. He handed me a telegram from the Column Headquarters. The leaders of the 9th Column conveyed Commander Lin's battle orders in the telegram. We were ordered to penetrate the enemy's thirty-mile-deep defense zone using infiltration tactics that night, and by dawn, to insert ourselves into the Yingpan, Bai Laohutun, and Wu Xingtun areas north of Jinzhou, cutting off the connection between the enemy's Provisional 22nd Division and Jinzhou, resisting enemy reinforcements from Jinzhou, and cooperating with the main force to encircle and annihilate the enemy in the Xuejiatun and Gewenbei areas. At the end of the telegram, the leaders instructed us: "This action is related to whether Commander Lin's entire operational intention can be realized, and the task is extremely important and arduous. Commander Lin will directly command, and you should immediately communicate and liaise with the headquarters, and report the battle plan and battle situation to the leaders at any time."
    It was truly exciting. I quickly woke up Political Commissar Xu Guanghua, Deputy Division Commander and Chief of Staff Wu Hua, and other relevant personnel. The head of the Operations Section brought the map, and we crowded around it to study.
    Unfolding the map, the enemy's deployment north of Jinzhou appeared before our eyes: Fan Hanjie extended a long tortoise head northward from Jinzhou along the Jinzhou-Chengde railway, pushing Jinzhou's defense all the way to Yixian. The enemy's Provisional 22nd Division, located between Jinzhou and Yixian, echoed the north and south. To the west, the enemy relied on the mountains such as Maoshan, Guanyin Cave, and Yueyashan, which stretched across the northwest of Jinzhou, to build solid fortifications as a barrier, forming an outer defense line covering a hundred miles, attempting to block our army's offensive, buy time, and await reinforcements from within the Pass to save their imminent doom. The place we were going to was between the enemy's Provisional 22nd Division's station at Xuejiatun and Gewenbei, and Jinzhou, close to the northern gate of Jinzhou city. While conveying the mission, I drew a large oval red circle along the northern urban area of Jinzhou with a red pencil, like a wedge driven into the middle of the enemy, cutting off the connection between the enemy's Provisional 22nd Division and Jinzhou. The deputy division commander tilted his head, staring at the red circle, pondering. Everyone's eyes were also fixed on this area. Looking, looking, the deputy division commander suddenly stood up, his face beaming, and shouted excitedly:
    "Commander Lin's command is truly brilliant!" He slammed his hand on the map. "Look, without attacking Yixian first, our insertion like this, eating up the Provisional 22nd Division, will immediately cause the collapse of the enemy's defense system north of Jinzhou. Yixian! Jinzhou!" His right fist slammed on the Yixian and Jinzhou areas, shaking the entire map, and then he drew his fist to his chest, as if grabbing someone by the collar and roaring: "Fan Hanjie, where are you going to escape!"
    "Yes!" The political commissar continued, "Who would have expected that Commander Lin would decide to strike Jinzhou first! Originally, Changchun, Shenyang, and Jinzhou were three knives. Now, three knives are combined into one!" He looked at everyone and said, "Comrades, the superiors have placed this piece of steel on the edge of the blade. This is the Party's trust in us. We must make a name for ourselves!"
    "This is truly in line with Chairman Mao's military thinking! First, gnawing off Jinzhou, trapping the enemy in the Northeast, creates a situation where we can shut the door and beat the dog!" I added excitedly.
    We spoke with joy, and the blood in our bodies was boiling. However, the task was very arduous. It would be difficult to penetrate the enemy's thirty-mile defense zone, where every mountain had bunkers and every village had fortifications. How to complete the task and realize Commander Lin's strategic intentions? This was the central problem we were considering.
    Outside the window, it was dark before dawn, and the autumn wind was blowing the fallen leaves, rustling. The sound of the watch ticking, tick, tick, like hitting a person's chest. We were all pondering and thinking silently. At that time, the term "infiltration warfare" was new to us. As the name suggests, I thought this "infiltration warfare" might be like the spring water in a deep mountain ravine, flowing wherever there is a crack, flowing wherever there is a fork, and sometimes even seeping deep into the ground, and then emerging elsewhere. The enemy would never have imagined that we would be so "bold," daring to send troops deep into Jinzhou North before Yixian was captured and the front-line positions such as Maoshan were occupied. Our army's actions were unexpected, giving us the initiative in the battle. As long as our command was firm and our actions were swift and brave, we could drill in. As long as we drilled in and seized the position, no matter how many or how fierce the enemy, they would not be able to gnaw us down.
    Political Commissar Xu summed up this tactic in one sentence: "Drill in, stand firm, and that is victory!" And said: "This is our mobilization slogan."
    "During the penetration, the troops are likely to be cut off, divided, and lose command." The deputy division commander raised a very important question for discussion. He said: "We must make sure that commanders at all levels, and even every soldier, understand their tasks and our tactics. So that everyone can operate flexibly and with initiative in case of loss of command. The troops must be completely lightly armed, and the organs must be streamlined. Everyone carries two or three days of dry rations. Everything that cannot be carried is managed by the division's second-echelon logistics team."
    We thoroughly studied the various problems that might be encountered in the battle and the solutions. Finally, it was decided that in order for cadres to understand the situation and command the troops in a timely manner, cadres at all levels would command two to three levels higher during the forward penetration. Regiment cadres to the company, battalion cadres to the platoon… I personally took charge of the vanguard company to open a breakthrough for the entire division.

    (II)
    After a series of emergency mobilizations and preparations, the troops set out at three o'clock in the afternoon.
    The political commissar and I rode horses to catch up with the vanguard company – the 73rd Regiment.
    On the dusty road, the soldiers were marching forward in three columns, tall and spirited. Some commanders and political cadres were talking to the soldiers as they walked, waving their fists and military caps excitedly. The soldiers also raised their hands and shouted loudly. As the political commissar and I rode past them on horseback, they greeted us excitedly with their eyes, and every eye sparkled with the light of victory, expressing their determination to complete the task. The soldiers' high morale infected us, filling us with strength.
    We found Regiment Commander Wang Yong and Political Commissar Zhang Duoshu in the ranks of the vanguard company. Instructor Han Ruijin of the 3rd Battalion was also here, saying that the battalion had divided tasks and he was in charge of the spearhead platoon. I asked Wang Yong, "Have the soldiers clearly understood our tactics?"
    Wang Yong nodded happily and said, "They have."
    I tentatively questioned the soldiers beside me:
    "What do you do if you encounter enemy obstruction on the road?"
    "Charge fiercely and defeat them!" The soldiers answered loudly.
    "What if you can't defeat them?" the political commissar asked.
    "We'll go around them."
    "What if you are cut off by the enemy or get separated from the team?"
    "We'll find our own way and insert ourselves into the designated location."
    I was very satisfied with the soldiers' answers.
    At dusk, the troops arrived at Dashengbao, not far from the enemy's forward positions. A dark mountain range blocked our way.
    The troops stopped to wait for orders, concealed in the valley. The political commissar and I went to the front to scout the terrain. On the map, there were two passes through the enemy's forward positions: one was the highway from Dashengbao to Maoshan; the other was a small valley two or three miles to the right of the highway - Tiger Valley. The highway terrain was open, which was convenient for troop movement, but the enemy's defense was relatively strong and the blockade was very tight. In particular, the enemy on Maoshan was in a high position, controlling the highway, making it difficult for the troops to pass. What about Tiger Valley? Although the enemy had fortifications to block the passes on both sides of the mountain, no enemy activity was found in the villages in the valley, indicating that the defense was relatively lax. However, the terrain was treacherous, with high mountains and narrow valleys, resembling the mouth of a tiger. If the enemy blocked the passes, we would be in danger of being trapped in the valley. Where to insert ourselves? Take the highway or take Tiger Valley? The division's original combat plan was to take Tiger Valley. At this time, a scout reported that the enemy situation in Tiger Valley had not changed. I asked the political commissar, who agreed to take Tiger Valley. After thinking for a while, he said, "Should we call the cadres of each regiment to study it again and listen to everyone's opinions?"
    At the cadre meeting, opinions were not completely consistent. Some advocated a surprise attack, sneaking through Tiger Valley; others thought it was too risky and it would be better to attack the highway head-on. The political commissar and I carefully listened to the comrades' opinions, sometimes exchanging glances.
    Gradually, more people advocated taking Tiger Valley. The political commissar nodded to me, indicating: "We can summarize!" Everyone also looked at me, wanting me to speak. I combined everyone's opinions and said: "The enemy on the highway is heavily guarded. Even if we can open a gap, it will take time, which will alarm the enemy in the depths, which is very unfavorable to us. Although the terrain of Tiger Valley is dangerous, the enemy's defense is weak. We are acting at night, so we can take them by surprise. At the same time, the enemy is timid and generally does not dare to leave the fortifications at night, and shooting is not easy to be accurate. This gives us full confidence to insert ourselves."
    The political commissar asked, "Are there any different opinions?" Everyone expressed agreement. He said, "If this battle is fought well and Commander Lin's campaign plan is realized, we may liberate Jinzhou and capture Fan Hanjie alive. We must win! Not to mention Tiger Valley, even if it's the tiger's mouth, we must drill in and pull out its teeth. Comrades, do you have confidence?"
    Everyone answered "Yes!" loudly and dispersed from the meeting with full confidence.
    It started to drizzle, and the night was pitch black. The political commissar and I were about to part ways. I was going to advance with the vanguard regiment, and the political commissar was going to stay behind with the deputy division commander to control the troops. He walked to my side, standing close to me, and said with deep feeling: "Old Zeng, the troops' mission is very arduous, you must take care of yourself!"
    "Okay! I'll be waiting for you in front." I shook the political commissar's hand forcefully, moved.

    (III)
    The troops were moving in Tiger Valley. The towering mountains on both sides were dark and looming, as if about to fall down. We were groping forward along the rugged mountain road, one foot deep and one foot shallow, as if walking in a dark tunnel. From the front of the team, orders were constantly being whispered: "Pay attention to silence!" "No weapons are allowed to clank!"
    The rain was getting heavier, the sky was getting darker, and our pace was getting faster and faster. Wherever there was a place to put our feet, someone would walk. The team surged straight into the enemy's defensive depths.
    Suddenly, a few shots rang out from the front, "Bang, bang, bang," bullets whizzing overhead. I hurriedly squeezed through the people beside me, wanting to go to the front to see what was going on. Just a few steps, I heard someone whisper my code name, "Number One!" "Number One!" The voice was that of instructor Han Ruijin. He ran over to report: "The enemy has been discovered in Tiger Valley Village!"
    Hearing that there were enemies in the village, my thoughts churned instantly. "Was our reconnaissance wrong? Or has the enemy situation changed?" Obviously both were possible. However, the troop's actions were highly secretive and rapid, and it was impossible for the enemy to have detected them in advance. What exactly was going on? Time did not allow me to think any more. One thing was certain about the current situation, and that was that there was no retreat; after passing through the village, we would break through Tiger Valley. I ordered Han Ruijin: "The spearhead company expands, concentrates firepower, charges fiercely, and defeats them!" Han Ruijin answered loudly: "Yes!" Turning around, he raised his pistol into the air and shouted: "Comrades, follow me!" The soldiers followed him closely and charged up. The impassioned bugle call for the charge resounded throughout the valley, and the sounds of light machine guns and 60mm mortars immediately rang out in a chorus. Soon, the soldiers charged into the village. In the flashes of exploding grenades, the enemy fled in all directions. The enemies on the mountains on both sides also cried out in panic and fired their guns and artillery wildly.
    After the breakthrough was opened, I ordered Regiment Political Commissar Zhang Duoshu, who was beside me, to send out two companies to monitor the enemies on the mountains on both sides, and to let the follow-up troops pass quickly, and to order the spearhead company to quickly reorganize its ranks and insert itself inside. After a while, Political Commissar Zhang caught up and reported: "The enemies are firing blindly on the mountains, and the troops are passing through quickly." Only then did I breathe a sigh of relief.
    The troops advanced very quickly. On the muddy road, there was only the sound of footsteps, splashes, the sound of falling, and the slight clanging of weapons. The night shrouded everything, and we quickly plunged into the depths of the enemy's lines north of Jinzhou. The gunshots and shouts of the enemies on Tiger Valley Mountain were increasingly left behind.
    After an hour, the troops advanced more than ten miles and arrived at Erlangdong. The 74th Regiment on the right had already crossed Guanyindong Mountain and arrived first. They had captured the enemy's sentry outside the village and quietly entered the village. Without firing a shot, a platoon of the enemy was captured while still asleep. When I arrived, Regiment Commander Li Meixi was interrogating them in a room. The prisoners were all wearing only shirts and underpants, huddled shrunken in the corner of the room.
    When Regiment Commander Li saw me, he excitedly reported: "Division Commander, we've all crossed over. It's raining heavily, and the enemies are all hiding in the mountain bunkers and the broken temple in Guanyindong, blocked by us and unable to come out. Listen, the enemies are still firing guns wildly in the temple..." The prisoners were stunned one by one when they heard Li Meixi call me "Division Commander." One prisoner whispered, "Did you hear that? Division Commander. They've all crossed over, so fast!" At this time, there was a sudden cry of alarm outside the door: "It's burning!" Regiment Commander Li and I hurried out to see that a red glow had appeared in the northwestern sky, and a burst of gunfire could be heard. Li Meixi clapped his hands happily and shouted: "Well done! Really well done!" It turned out that the company monitoring the enemies had set fire to the broken temple.
    At this time, the political commissar of the division sent a staff officer to report: "The 75th Regiment and the division headquarters have all passed through Tiger Valley."
    In Erlangdong, the troops dispersed. Regiments, battalions, and companies were like countless sharp knives, some heading east, some heading south, and some heading north, inserting themselves into their designated positions. In an area of more than twenty miles north of Jinzhou, there was the sound of artillery fire everywhere, the light was flashing, and fierce battles were unfolding. How the subsequent battle developed, and how each detachment inserted itself into the designated position, no one could say clearly. One battalion started out as one unit, fighting as they walked, but was suddenly cut off by the enemy, and the follow-up troops sought another path, but were soon cut off again; the troops were divided into countless units by the enemy, some even dividing one squad into three or four units. Every commander and fighter demonstrated the heroic, tenacious, flexible, and mobile fighting style of the People's Liberation Army, reaching their designated positions by detours and twists.
    According to plan, the division's headquarters should be set up in Daziying. According to the prisoners, there was an enemy battalion stationed here. When we arrived at Daziying, the 3rd Battalion of the 73rd Regiment was passing through. They originally wanted to bypass the north end of the village, but encountered enemy obstruction on the north mountain. Now they turned around and bypassed the south. The enemies in the village and on the mountain blocked the passage with fire, and red tracer bullets splattered everywhere.
    Amid the boiling gunshots all around, the division headquarters, set up in a dark, deep gully, began to work. Signalmen and scouts came and went, reporting the situation. The radio received a telegram from the 73rd Regiment, stating that the regiment had reached the Yingpan and Liangma Mountain line, and had annihilated an enemy company. The staff officer spread out the map in the dark, and the guard held a flashlight to illuminate it. I drafted the first battle report to Commander Lin:
    "All units of our division have reached their designated positions and are engaged in fierce battles with the enemy."
    The next day, before dawn, the battle situation was intricate and complex, with enemy and our positions intertwined, and gunshots and artillery fire were deafening. The enemies were like a hornet's nest that had been punctured, fighting with us in confusion everywhere. The division headquarters was moved to a gully north of Daziying Village. The troops were attacking the enemies on the surrounding mountains, squeezing out a piece of ground for the headquarters.
    The political commissar and the deputy division commander came up with the division headquarters. I introduced the situation to them and said, "There are enemies on the mountain next to the headquarters. We are now in the middle of the enemy's encirclement."
    "But from the perspective of the entire battlefield, the enemies are in our encirclement." The political commissar took over my words and said excitedly. He hugged his arms forward, making an encirclement gesture.
    Suddenly, a person ran down the mountain, rushing to the front of the headquarters and asking abruptly: "Is it still very quiet here?" Everyone was stunned by the question. It was impossible to see who it was at night. The guard asked him in return, "Who are you?"
    He said, "I'm from Maoshan, the officer asked me to inquire about the news." After speaking, he asked again, "Have the Eighth Route Army come here?"
    The soldiers, hearing that it was the enemy, grabbed him and twisted him. He didn't understand what was going on, and shouted loudly, "What are you doing?" When he understood that we were the Liberation Army, he immediately collapsed to the ground, like a punctured ball, muttering: "So confused! So confused!"
    After interrogation, it turned out that this was an enemy deputy platoon leader, who had mistaken us for his own people. Looking at the prisoner squatting on the ground, I thought: the enemies north of Jinzhou are now in complete chaos and have not yet come to their senses. However, the enemies will soon come to their senses, they will launch a frantic counterattack, and fierce battles will begin at dawn. I ordered each regiment to seize the time to build fortifications and prepare to defeat the enemy's counterattack. Through repeated contact, the order was finally conveyed to each regiment.
    "Number One! There's a telegram." As soon as I looked up, the deputy division commander handed me the telegram. The telegram said: "Telegram received, we are very pleased that your division has reached its designated position! We hope that you will quickly build fortifications, stand firm, and resolutely block the enemy from reinforcing from the north and escaping from the south." The telegram was sent from the Northeast Headquarters. The political commissar said: "This is an encouragement from the leaders of the headquarters. We must resolutely complete the task; and tell the troops about this telegram."
    As soon as dawn broke, the prelude to the enemy's attack began. A dozen enemy planes flew low over the headquarters, bombing and strafing the nearby mountains; the enemy's artillery from Jinzhou also poured down on our army's positions in waves. The explosions shook the sky, and the blasted soil was like black fountains, mixed with the yellow smoke columns that rose into the sky, dispersing the white mist of the morning.
    The headquarters immediately became tense. The telephone rang urgently, and the comrades from the Operations Section and the Reconnaissance Section were busy. Deputy Division Commander held the earphone in one hand and covered his left ear with the other, his face tense, speaking loudly. He turned to me and said: "The 74th Regiment has engaged with the enemy's reinforcements. The enemy is attacking Wu Xingtun with more than two regiments, and Bai Laohutun with more than one regiment."
    Ju Zhitian, the head of the Operations Section, delivered a telegram from the 73rd Regiment:
    "The enemy is attacking our Yingpan line with more than two regiments, and more than ten tanks and an armored train."
    At this time, the enemies remaining in our positions also began to counterattack. Far and near, villages and roadsides, smoke and dust were flying everywhere, and various gunshots, artillery fire, and grenade explosions were mixed together, and the noise directly vibrated the eardrums and the heartstrings. Fan Hanjie, the deputy commander of the Kuomintang "Northeast Suppression General Headquarters," had gone mad! I seemed to see Fan Hanjie in his reinforced concrete shelter, anxious like an ant on a hot pot, scratching his ears and cheeks, hugging his head and roaring: "The Communists are too ruthless!" I excitedly said to the deputy division commander: "Order each regiment to fight hard, and at any cost, block the enemy!" Then, carrying binoculars, I walked up the small hill next to the headquarters. The enemies appeared in my lens, countless small black dots, chaotic, crowded, flocking from Jinzhou. As soon as they approached our army's positions, they retreated like the receding tide. The political commissar and I lay down together, also holding binoculars and observing intently. He said to himself: "Ah! Fighting so bravely! … Collapsed! Good! Good! … Ah, they are surging up again!" My heart changed with the changing battle situation, sometimes excited and sometimes nervous.
    The first round of the enemy's attack was defeated. The breeze dispersed the smoke of gunpowder, and the sound of gunfire gradually subsided.
    The headquarters anxiously collected the battle situation and victories of each regiment. One heroic and tenacious fighting story after another was reported. The machine gunner of the 5th Company of the 73rd Regiment was buried seven times by the soil blasted up by artillery shells, but still did not stop shooting; the enemy repeatedly charged with a regiment, but the Jinyi Highway was still firmly held in the hands of our 5th Company; the 3rd Platoon of the 9th Company was like a sharp knife inserted on the Jincheng Railway, facing the enemy on three sides, defeating the enemy's attack of one battalion. They swore: "As long as the 3rd Platoon is here, the position is here, and as long as one person is alive, the enemy will not be able to pass!" The 2nd Company of the 74th Regiment, under the continuous bombing of three enemy planes, still repelled multiple attacks by an enemy battalion, and Wu Xingtun was as stable as Mount Tai, while surrounding the 2nd Company's position were layers of enemy corpses. …
    "There's just no report from Bai Laohutun!" The political commissar said worriedly.
    I called Li Meixi, the regiment commander of the 74th Regiment. He was also anxious. He told me: It was the 1st Company that was defending Bai Laohutun. They were surrounded by the enemy as soon as the battle began, and later retreated to the village. The enemy's planes and tanks were all dispatched, and the battle was very fierce. The situation in the village was unclear, and several people were sent to contact them, but they were sacrificed on the road. The 1st Company also did not send anyone out. Their situation was difficult, but the position was still in the hands of the 1st Company.
    Bai Laohutun was only four and a half miles from Jinzhou, located on the highway from Jinzhou to Xuejiatun and Gewenbei, and was the main direction for the enemy to reinforce the Provisional 22nd Division to the north. I ordered Li Meixi: "Be sure to find a way to find out the situation and provide reinforcements!" When I put down the phone with a heavy heart, the question "Can the 1st Company hold on?" pressed me.
    The political commissar said: "The cadres of the 1st Company are strong, and the troops have been tempered by many cruel battles. Summer training was also the best company in the division. Although the situation is difficult, they can still hold on." He seemed to be comforting me, and also comforting himself.
    The enemies began a frenzied offensive again, and it was even more violent than the previous one. Bombers, a few, a dozen, even twenty, flew in batches to drop bombs and strafe. Shells whizzed overhead, and the sky was like a six or seven grade wind. The telephone rang loudly, and several staff officers were lying on the telephone, shouting hoarsely: "Louder, louder, can't hear you!" The radio operators, each with headphones, sat motionless next to the machine, calmly searching for the calling signal. Bombings, shells, other people's shouts… seemed to have nothing to do with them. The political commissar and I stared at the map, listening to the storm-like gunfire on the positions.
    "Look, the enemies have launched a full-line attack again." I pointed to the ten-mile battle line close to the northern gate of Jinzhou and said, "Fan Hanjie has used all his strength."
    "Yes." The political commissar estimated, "The enemies are fighting so desperately, probably because our main forces have launched a general attack on the Provisional 22nd Division."
    Suddenly, a row of shells exploded not far from the headquarters, and the scorching air wave overturned the map. Then there was another row, even closer, and soil and rocks fell beside us. The deputy division commander spat the soil out of his mouth and said, "Division Commander, the enemies are taking care of us, let's move quickly!"
    We had just walked not far when a row of shells blew up the place where we had just been. Several little devils in the guard class stuck out their tongues and shouted a few times, "How dangerous!"
    At noon, the headquarters was set up again in a nearby valley. The radio received a report from the 75th Regiment: "A part of the enemy Provisional 22nd Division is breaking out towards Henan from Xuejiatun, and we are blocking them." The political commissar's estimation was confirmed, and the headquarters became active. The political commissar said: "Quickly tell the troops this news. The main forces of the 8th Column and the 26th Division of the 9th Column have launched a general attack, and the Provisional 22nd Division is about to be annihilated. As long as we hold on for the last few minutes, victory will be ours!" Through telephones and telegrams, the exciting news quickly spread to every position like an electric current, and in the heart of every soldier: "Hold the position, annihilate the enemy!" The soldiers shouted slogans, repelling the enemy's attacks again and again. When the bullets ran out, they threw stones. When the enemies approached, they stabbed with bayonets. The sounds of killing and shouting shook the sky, and the positions were filled with blood shadows and sword lights.
    At this time, it was difficult for me to restrain my emotions. I sometimes carried binoculars and climbed to the top of the hill, looking anxiously at the positions where the swords were flashing, and sometimes lay on the telephone and clenched the earphone to urge for information. I wished I could rush forward and have a face-to-face melee with the enemies.
    At 2 pm, the situation was extremely serious. The enemies occupied one end of the Wu Xingtun mountain, but the 2nd Company of the 74th Regiment was still at the other end, blocking the enemies. At this time, the enemies were very close to the division headquarters. The staff officers and service personnel all picked up their weapons and prepared to join the battle. I immediately ordered a part of the 3rd Battalion of the 74th Regiment to reinforce Wu Xingtun. Like tigers, they counterattacked and repeatedly fought the enemies four or five times, finally regaining the position.
    There was still no report from Bai Laohutun. I called Regiment Commander Li Meixi of the 74th Regiment again, and the answer was still that the situation was very serious. None of the people sent to contact them had returned; there were too many enemies outside the village, and the reinforcing troops could not enter. However, the gunshots in Bai Laohutun were fierce, so it could be judged that the 1st Company was still stubbornly resisting.
    At this time, from the perspective of the entire division, each regiment, each battalion, and each company was fighting, facing enemies several times their size, and could not spare any forces to reinforce Bai Laohutun. I was uneasy, and the political commissar and I called every now and then to ask about the situation, but the answer we received each time was "the situation is unclear."
    The fierce battle continued until dusk, and the enemies attacking from four directions suffered heavy casualties and retreated in defeat. A report of victory came, and the enemy Provisional 22nd Division in Xuejiatun and Gewenbei was annihilated by a part of the fraternal 8th Column and the 26th Division. At nightfall, the enemies remaining in our positions had been cleared. The various scattered troops gradually connected. At this time, we withdrew our troops to reinforce Bai Laohutun, opened the enemy's encirclement, and joined forces with the 1st Company, which had been fighting alone.
    The telephone rang crisply. I picked up the telephone, and it was the voice of Regiment Commander Li Meixi: "Division Commander, we have joined forces with the 1st Company. They fought really well..." He told me: An enemy regiment attacked Bai Laohutun for a whole day, and after repelling fifteen enemy assaults, the 1st Company was finally left with only thirty-seven people, stubbornly defending a lone courtyard. The enemies set fire to them, and they fought in the fire. Instructor Tian Guangwen, at the most critical time, still led the troops to sing "The Glorious Zhu De Grenadier" while throwing grenades; Company Commander Chen Xueliang threw grenades with the soldiers, and his arms were swollen, and his hands were blistered with blood from the red-hot guns and artillery. When their bullets ran out, they smashed their watches, burned their documents and banknotes, and prepared to fight the enemies to the end, and resolutely not be captured! … He told me excitedly on the phone: "Division Commander, we ask for the 1st Company to be awarded!" His voice was very loud, and even the political commissar sitting next to him heard it. The political commissar said repeatedly: "The proposal is right, they should be commended! They should be commended!"
    "Bai Laohutun, a fierce tiger really emerged today." I said as I put down the phone.
    The political commissar and I walked out of the headquarters. The wind blowing on our scalding faces felt especially cool. The mountains, villages, and forests that had been fiercely fought over during the day were still burning, showing an arc-shaped battle line. Behind the dancing firelight, the city walls of Jinzhou were revealed. At this time, the connection between Jinzhou and Yixian had been cut off by us, the main force of the enemy Provisional 22nd Division had been annihilated, the Jinzhou Airport had been controlled by our artillery fire, and our powerful corps was approaching the city of Jinzhou from all directions, and Fan Hanjie and his hundreds of thousands of bandit troops had become turtles in a jar.

    少将　曾雍雅
    （一）
    1948年，部队还在夏季大练兵的时候，林总就在计划着一个大的战役。这个计划的具体内容，那时谁也不知道。
    9月11日，我们二十五师奉命以极其秘密神速的行动，西渡大凌河，协同四纵突然包围了义县，接着又奉命将围城的任务交给三纵，部队南去准备打援。不久，部队又转向西南，日夜兼程来到锦州西北的大、小叶家屯一带集结待命。一路上只见许多部队东来西去调动频繁，炮车骡马络绎不绝。我们师的几个领导干部私下议论，可能一个大的战役行动已经开始了。
    24日天快破晓，我被机要科长乔遵一声“报告”惊醒了。他交给我纵队司令部来的一份电报。九纵首长在电报上传达了林总的战斗命令。命令我们当天夜里，以渗透战法穿透敌人三十里路的防御纵深，天明前插到锦州北面的营盘、白老虎屯、五姓屯一带去，切断敌暂二十二师与锦州的联系，抗击锦州敌人的增援，配合主力部队围歼薛家屯、葛文碑一带敌人。在电报的末了，首长向我们叮嘱说：“此次行动关系着林总整个作战意图能否实现，任务十分重大艰巨。林总将直接指挥，你们应立即与总部构通联络，把战斗计划和战斗情况随时向首长报告。”
    真是令人兴奋。我赶忙喊醒政委徐光华同志、副师长兼参谋长吴华同志和其他有关人员。作战科长找来地图，我们就挤着在图上研究起来。
    展开地图，锦北敌人的布置出现在我们眼前：范汉杰从锦州沿锦（州）承（德）铁路往北，伸出了一个长长的乌龟脑袋，把锦州的防御一直推到义县。在锦州和义县中间的敌暂二十二师，正好呼应南北。西面，敌人凭借着帽山、观音洞、月牙山等横亘锦州西北的大山，构筑起坚固的工事以为屏障，构成方圆达百里的外围战线，妄图阻挡我军的进攻，争取时间，等待关内的援兵，挽救即将灭亡的命运。我们要去的地方，是敌暂二十二师的驻地薛家屯、葛文碑和锦州之间，紧靠着锦北城关。我一面传达任务，一面用红铅笔沿着锦北城区画了个椭圆的大红圈，就像一把楔子楔在敌人中间，斩断了敌暂二十二师和锦州的联系。副师长偏着头注视着这个红圈，琢磨着。大家的眼睛也一齐盯着这块地方。看着，看着，副师长突然眉飞色舞地立起身来，兴奋地喊道：
    “林总的指挥真是妙透咯！”他把手猛劈在地图上。“你们看，先不攻义县，我们这样插进去，吃掉暂二十二师，锦北敌人的防御体系就立将土崩瓦解。义县！锦州！”他右拳猛捶在义县和锦州地域，使整个地图为之震动，随即抽拳举到胸前，好像抓着一个人的衣领吼道：“范汉杰，往那里逃！”
    “是呀！”政委接上来说：“谁能料到林总决定先从锦州开刀哟！本来嘛，长春、沈阳、锦州，这是三刀。现在三刀并作一刀切！”他望了望大伙，又说：“同志们，上级把我们这块钢放在刀刃上，这是党对我们的信任，我们一定要打出个名堂来！”
    “这才真正合乎毛主席军事思想啦！先把锦州啃掉，把敌人关在东北，就给我们造成关门打狗之势啦！”我又兴奋地补充了一句。
    我们喜悦地谈说着，全身的血液都沸腾起来。但是，任务是很艰巨的。要穿透敌人山山有碉堡、村村有工事的三十里防御纵深，困难一定很多。如何完成任务实现林总的战略意图呢？这是我们考虑的中心问题。
    窗外正是黎明前的黑暗，秋风吹着落叶，沙沙作响。手表宗宗声，一下，一下，像撞击着人的胸膛。我们都在沉思默想着。那时，“渗透战”这个名词，我们还是初次听说。顾名思义，我想这“渗透战”可能就像深山沟里的泉水似的，见缝便淌，有岔就流，有时甚至深深地渗到地里去，到另一处再冒出来。敌人万想不到我们会这样“胆大包天”，义县未克，帽山等前沿阵地未占领，竟敢派兵深入锦北。我军的行动是出敌不意的，这就掌握了战斗中的主动。只要我们指挥坚定，行动迅速勇猛，就能钻进去。只要钻进去，抓住了阵地，敌人再多再凶也啃不动我们了。
    徐政委把这种打法归纳成一句话：“钻进去，站稳脚，就是胜利！”并说：“这就是我们的动员口号。”
    “在穿插途中，部队很可能被敌人切断、分割，失掉指挥。”副师长提出一个很重要的问题来研究。他说：“我们必须使各级指挥员，甚至每个战士都明确自己的任务、我们的打法。使每个人在万一失掉指挥的情况下，都能够灵活、机动地作战。部队要彻底轻装，机关要精悍。每个人带两三天干粮。一切带不动的东西，由师后勤二梯队负责管理。”
    我们周密地研究了战斗中可能遇到的各种问题和解决的办法。最后决定为使干部能及时了解情况，指挥部队，各级干部在向前穿插时，提前两级到三级指挥。团的干部到连，营的干部到排……我亲自掌握前卫连，为全师打开突破口。
    （二）
    经过一系列的紧急动员和准备，下午三点，部队出发了。
    我和政委骑马去追赶前卫连——七三团。
    在飞扬着尘土的路上，战士们雄赳赳，气昂昂，成三路纵队，大步向前走着。有的指挥员、政治干部边走边向战士们讲话，激动地抡着拳头，挥舞着军帽。战士们也扬着手大声地呼喊着。当我和政委骑马从他们身旁跑过的时候，他们都兴奋地用眼睛向我们打招呼，每一双眼睛里都闪烁着胜利的光辉，他们是在表达完成任务的决心。战士们高涨的战斗热情感染着我们，使我们浑身充满了力量。
    我们在前卫连的队伍里找到团长王勇和政委张多澍。三营教导员韩瑞金也在这儿，他说营里分工，他掌握尖兵排。我问王勇：“我们的打法，战士们都明确了吗？”
    王勇高兴地点头，说：“都明确了。”
    我试探地考问身旁的战士：
    “你们说，路上碰到敌人阻挡，怎么办？”
    “猛冲猛打，打垮它！”战士们响亮地回答。
    “打不垮，怎么办呢？”政委问道。
    “我们就从旁边绕过去。”
    “你们万一被敌人切断，或者掉了队怎么办？”
    “我们自己找路，插到指定地点去。”
    我很满意战士们的回答。
    黄昏的时候，部队到达大胜堡，前面不远就是敌人的前沿阵地了。黑糊糊的一片大山，横挡着我们的去路。
    部队停止待命，隐蔽在山沟里。我和政委到前面看地形。在图上，通过敌人的前沿阵地有两个山口：一是从大胜堡到帽山的公路；再是公路右侧两三里地的一条小山沟——老虎沟。公路地形开阔，便于部队运动，但敌人防守的兵力比较雄厚，封锁很严密。特别是帽山的敌人居高临下，控制着公路，部队很难通过。老虎沟呢？敌人虽在两面山头上有封锁山口的工事，但沟内村子里没发现敌人动静，看来防守比较松懈。只是地形险恶，高山狭谷，貌似虎口，如果敌人堵住山口，我们就有被压在山沟里出不去的危险。从甚么地方插进去？走公路还是走老虎沟？师原定战斗方案是走老虎沟。这时侦察员来报告，老虎沟的敌情没有变化。我问政委，政委表示同意走老虎沟。他想了一会，又说：“是否把各团的干部找来再研究一下，听听大家的意见。”
    干部会上，意见不完全一致。有的主张出奇兵，偷渡老虎沟；有的认为这太冒险，不如从公路硬攻。我和政委细心地倾听着同志们的意见，有时交换一下眼色。
    渐渐地，主张走老虎沟的人多了。政委向我点点头，表示说：“可以总结了！”大家也都看着我，要我发言。我便综合大家的意见说：“公路上的敌人戒备很严，我们即算能打开缺口，也要费时间，这就会惊醒纵深的敌人，对我十分不利，老虎沟的地形虽然险恶，但是敌人防备薄弱，我们是夜间行动，可以出其不意。同时，敌人胆怯，夜间一般不敢出工事，射击也不容易准确。这就完全有把握插进去。”
    政委问：“还有不同意见吗？”大家都表示同意。他说：“这一仗打得好，实现了林总的战役计划，我们就可能解放锦州，活捉范汉杰。我们一定要胜利！别说是老虎沟，就是老虎嘴，我们也要钻进去拔掉它的牙。同志们，有信心吗？”
    大家响亮地答了一声“有！”信心百倍地散会了。
    天下起蒙蒙细雨来，夜漆黑漆黑。我和政委要分手了，我要随前卫团前进，政委要在后面和副师长掌握部队。他走到我身边，紧挨我站着，深情地说：“老曾，部队的任务很艰巨，你要注意保重！”
    “好！我在前面等着你们。”我感动地用力握着政委的手。
    （三）
    部队行进在老虎沟里。两面矗立的高山，黑压压的像要倒下来。我们沿着崎岖的山路，深一脚浅一脚地摸索着前进，像走在一条黑暗的甬道里。队伍前头不断低声地传来口令：“注意肃静！”“不许碰响武器！”
    雨下得更大了，天越来越黑，我们的脚步越来越快，只要是能下脚的地方，就有人走。队伍直向敌人阵地的纵深涌进。
    突然，前面砰，砰，砰响了几枪，子弹嗖嗖地从头顶飞过。我急忙挤开身旁的人，想到前边看个究竟。刚走几步，听见有人低声喊我：“一号！”“一号！”听声音是教导员韩瑞金。他跑过来报告说：“老虎沟村内发现了敌人！”
    听说村里有敌人，我的思想立时翻滚起来。“我们侦察情况错了？还是敌情有变化？”显然都有可能。但部队的行动机密神速，敌人不可能事先发觉。究竟是怎么一回事？时间不许我更多去考虑，当前的处境有一点是肯定的，就是有进无退；冲过村子，我们就突破了老虎沟。我命令韩瑞金：“尖兵连展开，集中火力，猛冲猛打，打垮它！”韩瑞金响亮地答了声：“是！”转身，把匣枪往空一举，喊道：“同志们，跟我来！”战士们紧跟着他冲了上去。激昂的冲锋号，响彻山谷，轻机枪声、六零炮立刻响成一团。很快，战士们就冲进了村子。在手榴弹爆炸的闪光里，敌人四散奔逃。两面山上的敌人也惊惶地乱喊乱叫，胡乱地打枪开炮。
    突破口打开后，我命令身旁的团政委张多澍派出两个连监视两面山上的敌人，让后续部队赶快通过，要尖兵连迅速整理好队伍向里插。一会，张政委赶上来，报告说：“敌人在山上盲目地打枪，部队正在迅速通过。”我这才松了一口气。
    部队前进得很快。泥泞的路上，只有扑哧扑哧的脚步声，摔跤声和武器轻微的碰撞声。夜幕笼罩着一切，我们迅速地向锦北敌人的纵深猛插。老虎沟山上敌人的枪声、喊声，越来越落在后面了。
    一个钟头，部队前进十多里，到达了二郎洞。右路七四团越过观音洞大山，已经先到了。他们在村外抓着了敌人的哨兵，悄悄进入村内，一枪未放，一个排的敌人还在睡梦里就当了俘虏。我去的时候，团长李梅溪正在一间屋里审问他们。俘虏都只穿着衬衣，裤衩，瑟缩地挤在屋角里。
    李团长见到我，就兴奋地报告说：“师长，我们全过来了，天下大雨，敌人全躲在山上碉堡里和观音洞的破庙里，被我们堵住出不来。你听，敌人还在庙里乱放枪……”俘虏们听见李梅溪称呼我“师长”，一个个都发了楞。一个俘虏悄声说：“听见没有？师长。他们全过来了，好快呀！”这时，忽然门外一阵惊叫：“烧起来了！”我和李团长忙出去看，只见西北方天空一抹通红，传来一阵枪声。李梅溪乐的拍手喊道：“干的漂亮！真漂亮！”原来是监视敌人的连队，把破庙点着火了。
    这时，师政委派参谋来报告说：“七五团和师直，已全部通过老虎沟。
    在二郎洞，部队分散开来。团、营、连像无数把尖刀，有的朝东，有的朝南，有的往北，向自己的指定位置插去。在锦北方圆二十余里的地区内，到处炮声隆隆，火光闪烁，展开了激烈的战斗。以后的战斗发展，各分队是怎样插到指定位置的，没有人能够说清。一个营开始是一路，边打边走，突然被敌人切断，后续部队另寻通路，不久又被切断；部队不知被敌人分割成多少路了，有的甚至一个班就分成了三四起。每个指战员都发挥了人民解放军英勇顽强机动灵活的战斗作风，迂回曲折地到达了指定位置。
    按计划，师的指挥所该设在达子营。据俘虏供称，这里有敌人一个营驻守。我们到达子营时，七三团三营正在通过。他们起初想从村北头绕过去，碰到北山上敌人阻挡，现在掉转头来从南面绕。村内和山头上的敌人用火力封锁着通路，红色曳光弹四处飞溅。
    在四周沸腾的枪声里，设在一条黑黝黝深沟里的师指挥所开始了工作。通信员、侦察员川流不息地来报告情况。电台收到了七三团的电报，该团已到达营盘、亮马山一线，并歼敌一个连。参谋摸着黑摊开地图，警卫员用手捂住电筒照着，我草拟了给林总的第一封战报：
    “我师各部已到达指定位置，正与敌激战中。”
    翌日，黎明之前，战斗情况错综复杂，敌我阵地犬牙交错，枪声炮声响成一片。敌人像被戳漏了的蜂窝，到处乱哄哄地和我混战。师指挥所移到了达子营村北山沟里。部队在攻击着周围山上的敌人，为指挥所挤出一块地盘来。
    政委和副师长带着师部上来了。我向他们介绍了情况，说：“指挥所旁边山上就有敌人，我们现在是在敌人的包围中间。”
    “但从整个战场来看，敌人却又在我们的包围中间。”政委接过我的话，兴奋地说。他两臂往前一抱，作了个包围的手势。
    忽然，山上跑下来一个人，一头闯到指挥所跟前，冒冒失失地问道：“你们这里还很安静？”问的大伙一楞。夜里看不清是甚么人，警卫员反问他：“你是谁？”
    他说：“我是帽山的，长官让我来打听消息。”说完，又问：“这里没来八路军吧？”
    战士们一听是敌人，上去一把将他扭住。他还不明白是怎么一回事，大吵大嚷：“你们要干啥？”等明白我们是解放军时，顿时瘫在地上，像一个跑了气的皮球，嘴里不住地咕噜：“真糊涂！真糊涂！”
    经过审讯，原来这是一个敌人的副排长，把我们当作了自己人。看着蹲在地上的俘虏，我想：锦北的敌人现在是乱成一团了，还没有清醒过来。不过敌人很快就会清醒过来的，它将要疯狂地反扑，激烈的战斗黎明就会开始。我命各团抓紧时间构筑工事，准备打垮敌人的反扑。通过多次联系，终于把命令传达到各团。
    “一号！有一份电报。”我刚一抬头，副师长将电报交给我。电报说：“电悉，你师已到达指定位置，甚慰！望赶筑工事，站稳脚，坚决堵住北援南逃之敌。”电报是东北总部发来的。政委说：“这是总部首长给我们的鼓励，我们要坚决完成任务；并把这个电报告诉部队。”
    天刚亮，敌人进攻的前奏就开始了。十几架敌机低低地掠过指挥所头顶，轰炸扫射附近的山峦；锦州敌人的排炮也一阵一阵地倾泻在我军阵地上。爆炸声震天动地，炸起的泥土像一股股黑色的喷泉，夹着冲天而起的黄色烟柱，驱散着白蒙蒙的晨雾。
    指挥所立刻紧张起来。电话铃急骤地响个不停，作战科和侦察科的同志们忙碌着。副师长一手握着耳机，一手捂住左耳，脸色紧张，大声地讲话。他转头向我说：“七四团和敌人增援部队接火了。敌人两个多团进攻五姓屯，一个多团围攻白老虎屯。”
    作战科长鞠之田送来七三团的电报：
    “敌两个多团，并有十多辆坦克、一列铁甲车，向我营盘一线阵地进攻。”
    这时，残存在我阵地内的敌人，也开始反扑了。远近四处，村落道边，到处浓烟、尘土飞腾，各种枪声、炮声、手榴弹声混成一片，噪声直震耳鼓，震人心弦。国民党“东北剿总”副司令范汉杰发疯了！我仿佛看见范汉杰在他钢筋水泥的掩蔽部里，急得像热锅上的蚂蚁，抓耳搔腮，抱头吼叫：“共军太狠毒了！”我激动地对副师长说：“命令各团，狠狠地打，不惜任何代价，阻住敌人！”然后，提着望远镜，走上指挥所旁的小山岗。敌人出现在我的镜子里，无数小黑点，纷纷乱乱，拥拥挤挤，从锦州蜂拥而来。刚接近我军阵地，又像退潮的海水，哗的溃退下去。政委和我一起卧着，也举着望远镜全神贯注地观察，他自言自语着：“啊！打得真勇敢！……垮下去了！好！好！……啊，又涌上来了！”我的心随着战斗情况的变化，一会兴奋，一会紧张。
    敌人进攻的第一个回合，被打垮了。微风吹散硝烟，枪炮声渐渐稀落下去。
    指挥所紧张地收集着各团的战斗情况，胜利战果。英勇顽强的战斗事迹，一个接着一个传来。七三团五连机枪射手被炮弹炸起的土埋了七次，仍未停止射击；敌人以一个团反复冲击，锦义公路仍牢牢地捏在我五连的手中；九连三班像一把尖刀插在锦承铁路上，三面临敌，打垮了敌人一个营的进攻，他们宣誓说：“三班在，阵地在，有一个人活着，敌人就过不去！”七四团二连在三架敌机轮番轰炸的情况下，仍然打退了敌人一个营的多次进攻，五姓屯始终稳如泰山，而包围二连阵地的是一层层的敌人尸首。……
    “就是没有白老虎屯的报告！”政委耽心地说。
    我打电话问七四团团长李梅溪。他也在着急。他告诉我：守白老虎屯的是一连。战斗开始就被敌人包围，后来退守屯内。敌人的飞机坦克都出动了，战斗很激烈。村内的情况摸不清，几次派人去联络，去的人都在路上牺牲了。一连也没派出人来。他们的处境很艰难，但阵地还在一连手里。
    白老虎屯离锦州只四里半地，座落在锦州通薛家屯、葛文碑的公路上，是敌人向北增援暂二十二师的主要方向。我命令李梅溪：“坚决想法查明情况，进行增援！”当我心情沉重地放下电话时，“一连能守住吗？”这个问题逼着我。
  政委说：“一连干部强，部队经过很多残酷战斗的锻炼，夏季练兵又是全师最好的连队，情况虽然困难，他们还是守得住的。”他像在安慰我，也像在安慰自己。
    敌人又开始了猖狂的进攻，而且比前一次更加猛烈。轰炸机，几架、十几架以至二十架，一批又一批地飞来投弹射击，炮弹呼呼地飞过头顶，天空中像刮着一阵阵六七级大风。电话铃当当当直响，几个参谋全身伏在电话机上声嘶力竭地喊着：“大声点，大声点，听不见！”报务员一个个带着耳机，一动不动地坐在机器旁，平心静气地搜索着呼唤的讯号，轰炸、炮弹、别人的呼喊……好像都与他们毫不相关。我和政委盯着地图，倾听着阵地上那像暴风骤雨似的枪声。
    “看，敌人又发动了全线进攻。”我指着紧靠锦北城关的十余里战线说：“范汉杰使出了他的全部力量。”
    “是的。”政委估计说：“敌人这样拼命，大概是我们主力部队向暂二十二师发起总攻了。”
    突然，一排炮弹在离指挥所不远的地方爆炸，炽热的气浪把地图掀翻过来。接着又是一排，离得更近，泥土、石块哗啦地掉在身旁。副师长啐着嘴里的土说：“师长，敌人照顾我们了，快转移吧！”
    我们刚走出不远，一排炮弹就把我们刚才呆的地方炸翻了。警卫班几个小鬼伸伸舌头喊了几声“好险！”
    中午，指挥所又在不远的山沟里安置下来。电台收到七五团一份报告：“敌暂二十二师一部由薛家屯向河南突围，我正在阻击。”政委的估计证实了，指挥所活跃起来。政委说：“赶快把这个消息告诉部队，八纵和九纵二十六师主力发起总攻了，暂二十二师就要被歼灭了，只要我们坚持住最后几分钟，胜利就是我们的！”通过电话、电报，令人兴奋的消息像电流一样迅速地传到各个阵地，每个战士的心里，“坚守阵地，消灭敌人！”战士们呼喊着口号，一次又一次地打退敌人的进攻。子弹打光了，用石头砸。敌人逼近了，用刺刀捅。杀声喊声惊天动地，阵地上一片血影刀光。
    这时，我很难克制自己的情感，一会提着望远镜登上山岗，关切地遥望那刀光闪烁的阵地，一会又伏在电话机上紧握耳机催问情况。恨不得冲上前去和敌人面对面地冲杀个痛快。
    下午二时，情况严重万分，敌人攻占了五姓屯山头的一端，但七四团二连仍在另一端，阻击着敌人。这时敌人离师指挥所很近了，参谋、勤杂人员，都拿起了武器，准备投入战斗。我立即命令七四团三营一部向五姓屯增援，他们像猛虎似地，反击出去与敌人反复冲杀四、五次，终于夺回了阵地。
    白老虎屯的情况还是没有报告。我再打电话问李梅溪团长，回答依然是情况很严重，派出联络的人没有一个转来；村外的敌人太多，增援的部队进不去。但白老虎屯枪声激烈，可以判断出一连仍在顽抗着。
    这时，从全师来看，各团、各营、各连都在战斗，都面对着几倍于自己的敌人，抽不出力量来增援白老虎屯。我心中忐忑不安，我和政委隔不久就打电话问一次，而每次得到的回答都是“情况不明”。
    激烈的战斗持续到黄昏，四路进攻的敌人伤亡惨重，败退了。捷报传来，薛家屯、葛文碑的敌暂二十二师，被兄弟部队八纵一部和二十六师消灭了。天黑时，我军阵地内残存的敌人已被肃清。各个分散的部队逐渐连结起来。这时，我们抽出部队向白老虎屯增援，打开了敌人的包围，和孤军奋战的一连会合在一起了。
    电话铃清脆地响着。我拿起电话，是团长李梅溪的声音：“师长，我们和一连会合了。他们打得真漂亮……”他告诉我：敌人一个多团向白老虎屯攻了整整一天，一连在打退敌人十五次冲锋后，最后只剩下三十七个人，坚守在一所孤院里。敌人放火烧他们，他们就在火里打。指导员田广文，在最危急的时候，还领着部队一边唱“光荣的朱德投弹手”，一边打手榴弹；连长陈学良和战士们一起甩手榴弹，把胳膊都甩肿了，枪炮打红了，手烫起了血泡。他们在子弹打光了的时候，砸碎了手表，烧毁了文件、钞票，准备和敌人拼到底，坚决不当俘虏！……他在电话里激动地对我说：“师长，我们给一连请功！”他说话的声音很大，连坐在旁边的政委都听到了。政委连声说：“提得对，应该立功！应该立功！”
    “白老虎屯，今天真正出了猛虎。”我一边说一边放下了电话机。
    我和政委从指挥所里走出来。风吹在发烫的脸上，觉得格外凉爽。白天激战过的山头、村庄、树林还在燃烧，显出一条弧形的战线。在跳动着的火光后面，闪露出锦州城垣。这时，锦州与义县的联系已被我切断，敌暂二十二师主力已被消灭，锦州飞机场已被我炮火控制，我强大兵团，正从四面八方直逼锦州城下，范汉杰和他手下十几万匪军已成瓮中之鳖了。
