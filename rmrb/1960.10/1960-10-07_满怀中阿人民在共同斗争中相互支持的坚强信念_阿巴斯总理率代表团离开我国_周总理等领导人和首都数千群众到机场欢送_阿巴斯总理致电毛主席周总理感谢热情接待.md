Xinhua News Agency, 6th. With the glorious envoy of the Algerian people, Premier Abbas Ferhat, and the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria led by him, concluded their friendly visit to China and left our country by plane from Beijing this morning. Premier Zhou Enlai and other leaders, along with thousands of people in the capital, went to the Capital Airport to see them off.

In his farewell speech at the airport, Premier Zhou Enlai asked the distinguished guests, who were about to return to their glorious fighting posts, to convey to the Algerian people that the Chinese people will always stand by the Algerian people.

Premier Zhou said that although China and Algeria are separated by thousands of miles, we share common goals in opposing imperialism and colonialism, safeguarding national independence, and defending world peace. We sympathize with and support each other. Premier Zhou pointed out that the joint communiqué issued by the two governments expresses the consistent views of the two governments on the current international situation, especially the situation in Algeria, and expresses the firm determination of the two peoples to support each other in the current common struggle. Premier Zhou sincerely congratulated the unity and victory of the Chinese and Algerian people and the Asian and African people.

Premier Zhou concluded by saying that as long as the Algerian people continue to strengthen their unity and persevere in their struggle, they will surely be able to finally and completely defeat imperialism and win their complete independence and freedom.

In his farewell speech, Premier Abbas said: We return home with this belief: the People's Republic of China firmly stands on the side of the Algerian people in opposing imperialism, and it will continue to support the Algerian people materially and morally until independence is achieved.

Premier Abbas said: At present, French imperialism, with the support of the United States and NATO countries, is imposing a cruel, unjust, and futile war on the Algerian people. In any case, Algeria is determined to fight, and with the support of Arab brothers, African and Asian countries, mainly China, it will surely gain freedom and gain its place in the family of independent countries. History will not go backward, and the era of colonialism is over.

Premier Abbas concluded by saying: We will tell the Algerian people everything that the Chinese people have done for us and will do for us. We will tell them that 650 million Chinese people now support their struggle for liberation and will support it more and more effectively in the future until the dying French imperialism helplessly recognizes our right to manage our own affairs freely and our right to control our own destiny.

At 8:30 a.m., after Premier Abbas and other distinguished guests arrived at the airport with Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and others, they cordially shook hands and said goodbye to our national leaders and responsible persons from all sides. Also present were Vice Premiers of the State Council Deng Zihui, Nie Rongzhen, and Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Cheng Qian, and Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Baorhan, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong and Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, and Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, and others.

The military band played the national anthems of the Republic of Algeria and the People's Republic of China. Premier Abbas, accompanied by Premier Zhou, reviewed the guard of honor. When Premier Abbas and other distinguished guests bid farewell to the well-wishers, people beat gongs and drums, shouted slogans, and waved bouquets. The neatly arranged male and female militia members, holding guns, stood in salute, paying high respect to the distinguished guests from Algeria.

Premier Zhou Enlai and other leaders accompanied the distinguished guests to the side of the plane and shook hands with them again to say goodbye. Young Pioneers from the capital presented flowers to Premier Abbas and other distinguished guests. After the plane took off, Premier Zhou Enlai and other leaders and well-wishers waved frequently, asking the distinguished guests to bring the greetings and friendship of the Chinese people to the Algerian people, wishing them a safe journey.

Also present at the airport today were Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Ji Pengfei, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association Liu Changsheng, responsible persons from other departments of our national government, various people's organizations, democratic parties, and Beijing Municipality, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in China and some African foreign guests in Beijing also went to the airport today to see them off.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Chairman Mao Zedong received a telegram from Abbas Ferhat, Premier of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, upon leaving China. In the telegram, Premier Abbas expressed his gratitude for the reception he and the delegation of the Algerian Provisional Government received during their visit to China.
