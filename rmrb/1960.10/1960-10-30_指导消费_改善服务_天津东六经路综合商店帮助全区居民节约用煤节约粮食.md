    Guiding Consumption, Improving Service
    Tianjin East Sixth Jing Road General Store Helps Residents of the District Save Coal and Grain
    (Our Tianjin dispatch, October 29) The sales staff of the East Sixth Jing Road General Store in Tianjin, in the increased production and economy movement centered on grain and steel, have adopted a method of contracted responsibility by district, going deep into the masses of residents, closely integrating the guidance of consumption, helping residents arrange their lives well, and promoting social conservation, achieving significant results. Since late August, the grain consumption in the whole district has generally been reduced by about 10%; the coal consumption of collective canteens has generally been reduced from an average of one to one and a half jin per person per day to six to nine liang, and the number of coal balls burned by each household per month has generally been reduced by about 40%, saving nearly one million jin of coal per month in the entire district; the popularization of new tailoring methods and the dismantling and renovation of old clothes, as well as the repair and reuse of various items, has saved a large number of daily necessities. Because residents' lives are well-arranged and expenses are planned, more than 95% of the residents have savings every month, and deposits are increasing month by month. In mid-September, the total amount of residents' savings increased by more than 4,000 yuan compared with mid-August, and on October 15, it increased by more than 30,000 yuan compared with mid-September.
    This store has six general stores and one hundred and six outlets in the grain, non-staple food, catering, department store, coal construction, and repair service industries, undertaking the supply of daily consumer goods for more than 13,000 households and more than 60,000 people in the entire commune. The store's Party organization, based on the requirements of the objective situation, decided to make promoting social conservation one of the store's central tasks, so it fixed the salespersons who were originally contracted to deliver vegetables to the door in the non-staple food industry to stay in the area for a long time, and together with the relevant personnel of the street residents' committee, formed a social conservation promotion team.
    After the salespersons were fixed by contracted responsibility, under the leadership of the commune Party committee, they often went deep into the homes of residents to publicize the current excellent political and economic situation, and introduced methods of saving coal and cloth in terms of eating, clothing, burning, and using, such as lighting the fire late and putting it out early, burning waste coal again, altering old clothes from large to small, and dismantling and renovating old clothes. In order to help residents solve various specific technical problems, the store also extracted technically better employees from the non-staple food, catering, grain, coal construction, and repair service industries to form six mobile service teams, which corresponded with the resident personnel to retrofit coal-saving stoves for residents and teach tailoring methods for saving cotton cloth, which powerfully promoted social conservation.
    The spirit of diligence and thrift is becoming more and more prevalent, and the masses are saving everywhere, which has brought new tasks to the commercial sector's repair and service. In addition to actively imparting technology, the store also adjusted and extended the business hours of the repair and service industry, added service items, and tapped labor potential, transferring eighty-eight technical personnel who knew how to sew and repair to add twenty-six service outlets, and also organized a repair service street with concentrated service outlets and complete repair items to facilitate the masses. In addition, it also combined with the commune-run repair service organizations to form a mobile service team, which regularly rotated to hold repair service "temple fairs" in residential areas such as East Sixth Jing Road, Chenjiagouzi, and Second Jing Road, collecting work when available and delivering items in a timely manner, which not only facilitated the masses but also promoted social conservation. Many residents, seeing that the repair service personnel could repair all kinds of damaged items, took out things they had originally planned to throw away for repair. An old lady in Shu'anli spent only six cents to repair six broken light bulbs, so she told everyone she met: "Repairing is really as good as new and saves money, and it's good." According to the statistics of the seven recent temple fairs and the service street, more than 15,000 pieces of various waste items were repaired for the masses.

    指导消费　改善服务
    天津东六经路综合商店帮助全区居民节约用煤节约粮食
    本报天津29日电　天津市东六经路地区综合商店，在以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动中，售货员采取分片包干的办法，深入居民群众，把指导消费、帮助居民安排好生活和推动社会节约紧密结合起来，获得显著成绩。从8月下旬以来，全地区粮食消费量一般都节约了10％左右；集体食堂的煤耗一般都由过去每人每天平均一斤至一斤半降低到六两到九两，居民每户每月烧的煤球数量一般降低40％左右，全地区每月节煤近百万斤；普遍推广新法剪裁和拆旧翻新、各种物品整修再用，节约了大批日用商品。由于居民生活安排得好，开支有计划，95％以上的居民月月有储蓄，存款逐月上升。9月中旬比8月中旬居民储蓄总额增加了四千多元，10月15日又比9月中旬增加了三万多元。
    这个商店设有粮食、副食、饮食、百货、煤建、修配服务等行业的六个综合商店和一百零六个门市部，担负着全公社一万三千多户居民、六万多人口的生活消费品的供应任务。商店党组织根据客观形势的要求，决定把推动社会节约作为商店的中心任务之一，于是将原来副食业分片包干送蔬菜上门的售货员固定下来，长期驻片，和街道居民委员会的有关人员一起，组成了社会节约推动组。
    售货员实行分片包干固定下来后，他们在公社党委的领导下，经常深入居民家中，宣传当前大好的政治经济形势，介绍有关吃、穿、烧、用等方面像晚升火、早落火，乏煤回烧，旧衣拆大改小，拆旧翻新等节煤、省布的方法。为了帮助居民解决技术上的各种具体问题，这个商店还从副食、饮食、粮食、煤建、修配服务等行业，抽出技术较好的职工，成立六个机动服务队，与驻片人员对口，给居民改装节煤炉子，传授节约棉布的剪裁方法等，有力地推动了社会节约。
    勤俭之风越兴越盛，群众处处节约，这就给商业部门的修配服务带来了新任务。这个商店除积极传授技术外，还调整和延长了修配服务行业的营业时间，增添服务项目，并且挖掘劳动潜力，抽调八十八名会缝补和修配的技术人员，增设了各种服务网点二十六处，还组织了一个服务网点集中、修配项目齐全的修配服务一条街，便利群众。此外，还和社办修配服务组织结合，组成流动服务大队，定期轮流在东六经路、陈家沟子、二经路等居民聚居的地方举办修配服务“庙会”，有活就收，交件及时，既便利群众，又推动社会节约。许多居民看到修配服务人员能修各种损坏的物件，纷纷把原来打算扔掉的东西都拿来修理。书安里有位老大娘只花六分钱就把六个断了丝的电灯泡给修复了，于是她逢人就讲：“修配真是整旧如新又省钱，又好。”仅据最近组织的七次庙会和服务一条街的统计，共为群众修理了各种废旧物品一万五千多件。
