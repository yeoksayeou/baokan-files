Albania, not long ago one of the most backward countries in Europe, was a semi-colonial country dominated by feudal relations of production. Its economy at that time was predominantly agricultural, with virtually no industry. The proportion of industry in the total national output of industry and agriculture was only 9.8% in 1938.

In the sixteen years since the establishment of the people's government, the face of our country has been fundamentally changed. In these sixteen years, the Albanian people have done tremendous work. Because our economy was very backward, because of the enormous losses caused by the war, and because of the sabotage activities of enemies at home and abroad, the work we have undertaken has been arduous. The working class, working peasants, and people's intellectuals, with their selfless labor, are changing the face of the motherland under the wise leadership of the Party. Life in Albania is becoming increasingly beautiful and happy.

The People's Republic of Albania is now firmly on the road of socialist construction. In the struggle to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, to strive for peace and democracy, and to oppose the vicious conspiracies of imperialism and revisionism, our country's international prestige is growing.

The Albanian Labor Party skillfully led the people in the national liberation war for freedom and democracy. After liberation, our Party did enormous work to restore and develop the national economy and culture and to promote its prosperity and progress. For our Party, this work was an objectively generated, essential, and pressing need. It was necessary to overcome the contradiction between the advanced political power established after the national liberation on November 29, 1944, and the backward economy.

The characteristics of our country in the early days of liberation were profound revolutionary changes in the economy. Foreign capital's concerns were nationalized, and industrial enterprises, banks, transportation, and foreign trade began to be monopolized by the state. As a result of the land reform, 70,000 peasant households were allocated 170,000 hectares of land, thus forever eliminating the material basis of large estate owners and big landlords. As a result of this and other measures, socialist ownership of the means of production was established.

Thus, the task before the Party was to establish the necessary prerequisites for the further victory of our revolution. To this end, the Party, at its First Congress in 1948, adopted a program of work for building socialism, the main contents of which were: socialist industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and cultural revolution. At the Second Congress held in 1950, the Party concretized this policy, that is, while carrying out socialist industrialization, it put forward the goal of transforming our country from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country. At the Third Congress held in 1956, the Party put forward the policy of accelerating socialist agricultural collectivization through the instructions of the Second Five-Year Plan.

This is the Marxist-Leninist program formulated by the Party for building socialism in our country, and this program has become the action of our Party and people in these years after liberation.

Now, on the eve of the sixteenth anniversary of our country's liberation and the imminent convening of the Party's Fourth Congress, the Party and all the Albanian people proudly see the results of this great work, see the victory of the invincible Marxist-Leninist ideology, see the results of our Party's correct, principled, and consistent struggle against the enemies within its ranks and those who violate the Party's correct line, against the mortal enemies of socialism and the cause of peace – imperialism and revisionism, and see the results of the internationalist assistance and fraternal cooperation between the countries of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

As a result of these efforts, our country has become an agricultural-industrial country, completed agricultural collectivization one year ahead of schedule, and the cooperative transformation of private handicrafts in cities has entered the final stage.

In 1959, the proportion of the socialist sector, including state-owned and cooperative sectors, accounted for 99% of the total industrial output value, 85% of the country's cultivated land area and 74.9% of the total agricultural output value, and 89% of retail commerce. In this year, the socialist sector of the national economy completed 84% of the national income.

In this way, in our country, socialism has triumphed over the capitalist system, and our country has established a socialist economic foundation. Now, with the implementation of the Third Five-Year Plan (the instructions of this plan will be adopted at the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party), our country is about to enter a new stage of development, a stage of building the material and technical foundation of socialism at a more rapid pace.

Compared with 1938, the total industrial output value of our country increased by 21.8 times in 1959. Currently, the output value of our country in two weeks is equivalent to the entire year of 1938. The development speed of some production departments is even faster. For example, chromium ore increased by 35 times, coal by 78 times, the chemical industry by 29 times, building materials by 25 times, glass and ceramics by 40 times, cotton textiles by 61 times, and so on. According to calculations, it would take the Zogu regime (note) eighteen years to complete the industrial output of 1958, sixteen years for electricity, and twenty years for light industry...

Similarly, we can now complete the amount of construction completed in the entire year of 1938 in just nine days, road transportation in twelve days, and sea transportation in two days. The degree of mechanization of our agriculture is more developed than that of some of our capitalist neighbors. Calculated on the average per thousand hectares of cultivated land, we have more tractors than Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey. Before liberation, our country had only thirty-five 15-horsepower tractors, and now we have four thousand 15-horsepower tractors.

Great achievements have also been made in culture and education. In our country, a universal compulsory education system for primary education was established for the first time. Every village has its own seven-year school. Now, our country trains an average of 350 cadres with higher education degrees every year. This number is the sum of the number of people with higher education trained during the entire reign of the Zogu regime. Today, compared with 1938, our schools have increased by 2.3 times, the number of students has increased by 3.2 times, and the number of teachers has increased by about 4 times. Today, one in every six people in our country is studying in formal schools (excluding various training courses). That is to say, there are 162 students per thousand residents in our country, while there are only 153 in Greece, 132 in Italy, 153 in Yugoslavia, and 85 in Turkey.

The above are some of the achievements we have made in the development of the national economy and culture. During this period, as our people say, we have always maintained combat readiness, strengthened revolutionary vigilance, and worked with a pick in one hand and a gun in the other. The Second Five-Year Plan played an important role in achieving these achievements, and this plan will be successfully completed and overfulfilled. The industrial output value at the end of 1960 stipulated by the Party's Third Congress has been overfulfilled one year ahead of schedule, that is, in 1959. The main characteristics of this period are: socialism continues to advance non-stop, ensuring the victory over capitalism; the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture continue. We have done tremendous work in developing industry, especially in developing the mining industry, which is the foundation of heavy industry under our country's conditions, and in utilizing existing production capacity.

The Party's Fourth Congress will be held this December. This will be an event of great historical significance, because the Congress will adopt instructions for further developing the socialist revolution.

The Party Central Committee's instructions on the Third Five-Year Plan are now being discussed among the working masses in urban and rural areas. According to this instruction, the total output value of industry and agriculture in 1965 will increase by more than 50% compared with 1960, with an average annual increase of 8.4%.

We will continue to further accelerate the country's socialist industrialization, establish new industrial sectors, such as the chemical industry producing phosphate and nitrogen fertilizers, establish a strong chemical and metallurgical complex, electrolyze copper and produce ferrochrome, and prepare for the establishment of a black smelting industry for ironmaking. A series of important enterprises will appear on the map of our country. This means that in the Third Five-Year Plan, we will lay a solid foundation for the future socialist material and technical foundation. Through the Third Five-Year Plan, our country will embark on the road of transition from an agricultural-industrial country to an industrial-agricultural country.

The Third Five-Year Plan will vigorously develop agriculture and the entire national economy and people's cultural undertakings.

Under the circumstances of the particularly backward technical economy left over from the old era, it is obviously impossible to realize the Party's grand program for the national socialist construction without huge investments and a large amount of construction. Our country's investment is first placed in the production sector (accounting for 80% of the investment), and industry always occupies a priority position. In the Second Five-Year Plan, investment in industry accounted for about 42% of the total investment. From the Third Party Congress to the present, eighty-five important projects have been built, of which seventy are industrial projects. This means that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, a new joint venture or factory in our country was put into production every month.

We will forever be grateful to the glorious Soviet Union, the great fraternal People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries for the generous and valuable assistance they have given us for our country's prosperity and progress.

The people of our country will remember for generations the great and selfless assistance given to our country by the fraternal Chinese people. This is a manifestation of high proletarian internationalism.

All the Albanian people are grateful to the Labor Party, because our Party has connected and forged such a close and fraternal friendship with the glorious Communist Party of China and the fraternal Chinese people. The friendship between the people of our two countries is long-standing and deep-rooted, and this friendship is built on the immortal foundation of Marxism-Leninism. We will protect this friendship like the most precious eyeball.

All the Albanian people are extremely delighted with the brilliant victories achieved by the fraternal People's Republic of China. They regard these victories as their own victories and as the victories of the entire socialist camp.

During our stay in China with the delegation of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association, we once again saw with our own eyes how the people, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, are holding high the three red banners. We saw the correctness of the Party's general line, and we saw the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward in the economy and the People's Communes. Everywhere, we saw the full labor enthusiasm, creativity, and fruitful results of the three-way combination of workers.

The Party's policy of walking on two legs has become the line of the entire working masses. Everywhere, we see the rapid progress of technology and the importance of using all existing equipment.

The Chinese people are outstanding, heroic, talented, peace-loving, and people with omnipotent hands.

It can be explained merely by such a fact that the People's Republic of China is changing the old and backward face of China in a very short period of time. The industrial output value in 1959 increased by 10.7 times compared with 1949, and the agricultural output value increased by 1.7 times. The Second Five-Year Plan was completed in two years. All of this shows the Great Leap Forward of the working class, working peasants, and people's intellectuals, and shows the bright prospects appearing before the great Chinese people.

The Albanian Labor Party is welcoming its Fourth Congress. Our Party, as the long-tested leader of the Albanian people, is more solid than ever, and is united in thought and action like steel. The people of our country are advancing with confidence on the road indicated by the Party.

In the nineteen years since the Party's birth, it has shown its loyalty to Marxism-Leninism to its people and the world. The Party has always waged a resolute, principled, and consistent struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, especially Yugoslav revisionism, and has always defended the purity of Marxist-Leninist ideology.

The socialist competition that has been launched throughout our country and the guarantees put forward by various labor units to complete the 1960 plan ahead of schedule are vivid manifestations of the love of the working masses in urban and rural areas for the Party and our beloved leader Comrade Hoxha. These demonstrate the determination of the people of our country to move forward bravely on the road to prosperity and progress.

    阿尔巴尼亚在社会主义建设的道路上
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员  普·穆拉
    阿尔巴尼亚在不久以前是欧洲最落后的国家之一，是一个封建生产关系占统治地位的半殖民地国家。我国当时的经济具有突出的农业性质，工业几乎一无所有。工业比重在1938年的全国工农业总产值中仅占9.8％。
    人民政权建立十六年来，已经根本改变了我国的面貌。十六年内，阿尔巴尼亚人民进行了十分巨大的工作。由于我国经济十分落后，由于战争造成的巨大的损失，由于内外敌人的破坏活动，所以我们担负的工作是沉重的。工人阶级、劳动农民和人民知识分子以其忘我的劳动，在党的英明领导下，正在改变着祖国的面貌。阿尔巴尼亚的生活，正变得日益美好和幸福。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国现在已坚决地走上了社会主义建设的道路。在维护马克思列宁主义纯洁性、争取和平和民主、反对帝国主义和修正主义恶毒阴谋的斗争中，我国的国际威望正在日益提高。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党曾经熟练地领导人民争取自由和民主的民族解放战争。解放后，我们党为恢复和发展国民经济和文化，为促使其繁荣和进步，进行了巨大的工作。对于我们党来说，这一工作是客观产生的必不可少的迫切需要。必须克服由于1944年11月29日全国解放后所建立的先进政权同落后经济之间的矛盾。
    我国解放初期的特点是：经济上深刻的革命变革。外国资本的康采恩收归国有了，工业企业、银行、运输、对外贸易开始由国家垄断。由于实行了土地改革，七万户农民分到了十七万公顷土地，从而永远消灭了大庄园主和大地主的物质基础。由于这一措施和其他措施的结果，建立了生产资料的社会主义所有制。
    这样，摆在党面前的任务是：为我国革命的进一步胜利建立必要的前提。为此，党在1948年的第一次代表大会上通过了建设社会主义的工作纲领，它的主要内容是：社会主义工业化、农业集体化和文化革命。在1950年召开的第二次代表大会上，党把这一政策具体化了，即在社会主义工业化的同时，提出这样一个目标：把我国从一个落后的农业国变成一个农业—工业国。在1956年召开的第三次代表大会上，通过了第二个五年计划的指示，党提出加快社会主义农业集体化的方针。
    这就是党所制订的我国建设社会主义的马克思列宁主义纲领，这一纲领变成了我们党和人民解放后这些年来的行动。
    现在，当我国解放十六周年前夕和党的第四次代表大会即将召开的时候，党和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民骄傲地看到这一伟大工作的成果，看到无往不胜的马克思列宁主义思想的胜利，看到我们党反对自己队伍中的敌人和违反党的正确路线的分子、反对社会主义和和平事业的死敌——帝国主义和修正主义所进行的正确的、坚持原则的和一贯的斗争的成果，看到以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营各国之间的国际主义援助和兄弟合作的成果。
    由于作了这些工作，我国已变成一个农业工业国，提前一年完成了农业集体化，城市私营手工业合作化已进入最后阶段。
    1959年，包括国营和合作社营的社会主义部门的比重已占工业总产值的99％，占全国耕地面积的85％和农业总产值的74.9％，占零售商业的89％。这一年，国民经济的社会主义部门完成了国民收入的84％。
    就这样，在我国，社会主义已经战胜了资本主义制度，我国已建立了社会主义经济基础。现在，随着第三个五年计划（这一计划的指示将在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第四次代表大会上通过）的实施，我国即将进入一个新的发展阶段，进入以更迅速的步伐建设社会主义的物质技术基础的阶段。
    1959年同1938年相比，我国工业总产值提高了二十一点八倍。目前，我国两个星期的产值就相当于1938年全年的产值。某些生产部门的发展速度显得更快。如铬矿增长了三十五倍，煤炭七十八倍，化学工业二十九倍，建筑材料二十五倍，玻璃和陶瓷四十倍，棉织品六十一倍等等。据计算，索古政权（注）时代要想完成1958年的工业产量需十八年，电力需十六年，轻工业需二十年……。
    同样，1938年全年完成的建筑量，我们现在只需九天即可完成，公路运输量十二天，海上运输量两天。我们的农业的机械化程度要比我国的某些资本主义邻国发达。按每千公顷耕地平均计算，我们的拖拉机数多于南斯拉夫、希腊和土耳其。解放前，我国仅有三十五台十五马力的拖拉机，现在我们已有四千台十五马力的拖拉机了。
    在文化教育方面也取得了很大的成就。在我们国家，第一次建立了初级教育的普遍义务教育制。每个乡村中都有自己的七年制学校。现在，我国每年平均培养出三百五十名具有高等教育程度的干部。这个数量也就是索古制度整个统治时期所培养的高等教育的人数的总和。今天同1938年比较，我们的学校增加了二点三倍，学生人数增加了三点二倍，教员人数增加了四倍左右。今天，我国每六个人中就有一人在正规学校中学习（不包括各种训练班）。这就是说，我国每一千居民中有一百六十二名学生，而希腊只有一百五十三人，意大利只有一百三十二人，南斯拉夫只有一百五十三人，土耳其只有八十五人。
    以上是我国在国民经济和文化的发展方面所取得的一些成绩。在这一期间，正如我国人民所说，我们时刻保持着战斗准备，加强着革命警惕性，一手拿镐、一手拿枪地进行工作。第二个五年计划对取得这些成绩起了重要的作用，这一计划将顺利完成和超额完成。党的第三次代表大会所规定的1960年底的工业产值，已经提前一年，即在1959年超额完成。这个时期的主要特点是：社会主义不停地继续前进，确保战胜资本主义；国家的社会主义工业化和农业社会主义改造继续进行。我们在发展工业，特别发展在我国条件下作为重工业基础的采矿业以及利用现有生产能力方面，作了巨大的工作。
    今年12月将要召开党的第四次代表大会。这将是一个具有重大历史意义的事件，因为大会将要通过进一步发展社会主义革命的指示。
    党中央关于第三个五年计划的指示，现在正在城乡劳动群众中进行讨论。根据这个指示，1965年的工农业总产值将比1960年增长50％以上，平均每年增长8.4％。
    我们将继续进一步加速国家社会主义工业化，将要建立新的工业部门，如生产磷肥和氮肥的化学工业，将要建立强大的化学冶金联合企业，将电解铜和生产铬铁，将要为建立炼铁的黑色冶炼工业做好准备工作。一连串的重要企业将要出现在我国的地图上。这就意味着，我们在第三个五年计划里，将为未来的社会主义物质技术基础建立一个巩固的基础。通过第三个五年计划，我国将走上从农业工业国过渡到工业农业国的道路。
    第三个五年计划将大力发展农业和整个国民经济及人民文化事业。
    在旧时代遗留下来的技术经济特别落后的情况下，如果没有巨额的投资和大量的建筑，要想实现党所提出的国家社会主义建设的宏伟纲领，显然是不可能的。我国的投资首先放在生产部门（占投资额的80％），而工业总是占据优先位置。在第二个五年计划中，用于工业的投资占整个投资的42％左右。从第三次党代表大会到现在，兴建了八十五个重要项目，其中七十个是工业项目。这就是说，我国在第二个五年计划期间，每月就有一个新的联合企业或工厂投入生产。
    我们永远感激光荣的苏联、伟大的兄弟的中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家，感激它们为了我国的繁荣和进步所给予我们的慷慨、宝贵的援助。
    我国人民世世代代将会记住兄弟的中国人民给予我国的巨大而无私的援助。这是一种高度的无产阶级国际主义的表现。
    全体阿尔巴尼亚人民都感激劳动党，因为我们党连接和铸炼了同光荣的中国共产党和兄弟的中国人民的如此亲密和兄弟的友谊。我们两国人民的友谊是悠久的和根深蒂固的，这种友谊是建立在不朽的马克思列宁主义基础上的。我们将像保护最宝贵的眼珠一样保护这种友谊。
    全体阿尔巴尼亚人民都为兄弟的中华人民共和国所取得的光辉胜利而感到无比欢欣。他们把这些胜利看成是自己的胜利，看成是整个社会主义阵营的胜利。
    我们在同阿中友协代表团在中国停留期间，再一次亲眼看到，在中国共产党的英明领导下，人民是怎样高举三面红旗的。我们看到了党的总路线的正确性，看到了经济上的大跃进和人民公社的巨大成绩。到处都可见到职工的十足的劳动干劲、创造性和三结合的丰硕成果。
    党的两条腿走路政策已经成了整个劳动群众的路线。到处都可见到技术的快速进展，见到重视利用一切现有的设备。
    中国人民是出色的、英勇的、天才的、爱好和平的和双手万能的人民。
    仅仅用这样的事实便可说明：中华人民共和国在一个十分短暂的时间内正在改变着旧的、落后的中国面貌。1959年工业产值比1949年增长了十点七倍，农业产值增长了一点七倍。第二个五年计划两年完成。所有这些，都说明了工人阶级、劳动农民和人民知识分子的大跃进，表明了出现在伟大的中国人民面前的光辉的远景。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党正在迎接自己的第四次代表大会，我们党作为阿尔巴尼亚人民久经考验的领袖，比任何时候都更加坚如磐石，在思想上和行动上都有钢铁般的团结一致，我国人民满怀信心地在党所指示的道路上前进。
    在党诞生后的十九年内，它向自己的人民和全世界表明了对马克思列宁主义的忠诚。党过去和现在都对帝国主义和现代修正主义特别是南斯拉夫修正主义进行坚决的、坚持原则的和一贯的斗争，始终保卫马克思列宁主义思想的纯洁性。
    我们全国所掀起的社会主义竞赛，各个劳动单位为提前完成1960年计划所提出的保证，是城乡劳动群众热爱党和我们亲爱的领袖霍查同志的鲜明表现。这些说明了我国人民向着富强、进步道路勇往直前的决心。
