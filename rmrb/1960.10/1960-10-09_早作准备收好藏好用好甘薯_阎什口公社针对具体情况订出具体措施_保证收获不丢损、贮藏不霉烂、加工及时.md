Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 9th October: The Yanshenkou Commune in Juancheng County, Shandong Province, while strengthening late-autumn management, has mobilized the masses to summarize experiences and adopt effective measures to prepare for the storage and processing of sweet potatoes.

This commune has planted a total of 59,082 mu of spring and summer sweet potatoes this year, accounting for 65.6% of the commune's grain area. Properly harvesting, storing, processing, and consuming sweet potatoes is of great significance to increasing commune income, improving the lives of its members, and supporting national construction. Therefore, when mobilizing the masses to do a good job in the "Three Autumns" work, the commune party committee carried out publicity on properly storing, processing, and consuming sweet potatoes, calling on the masses to contribute ideas and suggestions around harvesting, storing, processing, and consuming sweet potatoes effectively. At the same time, it also held symposiums with experienced farmers and technicians in different areas to summarize past experiences, pool wisdom, and put forward effective measures for the harvesting, storage, processing, and consumption of sweet potatoes.

In terms of harvesting, efforts are being made to ensure no loss or damage and to prevent rot, striving to complete the harvest before the frost. Based on the characteristics of this year's heavy sweet potato harvesting task, high labor demand, and tight time constraints, the task is contracted to work teams by area, ensuring that every piece of land is managed. In terms of harvesting time, two concentrated efforts will be made: spring sweet potatoes will be harvested five to seven days after the White Dew solar term; summer sweet potatoes will be harvested around the Cold Dew solar term. To ensure that sweet potatoes are not bumped, damaged, rotten, or wasted, the harvest should be done with gentle placement, gentle handling, and stable transportation, ensuring timely harvesting, timely transportation, and timely storage in cellars, carefully picking out bruised and diseased tubers. The past crude method of plowing with plows will be changed, and grab hooks or manure forks will be universally used for harvesting, and auxiliary labor will be organized for re-harvesting.

Based on this year's heavy rainfall, high groundwater levels, high moisture content in sweet potatoes, and difficulty in storage, in terms of digging sweet potato cellars, in addition to selecting high-lying, non-fertilized, wind-sheltered, and sunny locations, semi-yin and semi-yang multi-chamber improved shed cellars are commonly used. That is, digging four feet deep underground, connecting three feet high walls above ground, and then enclosing them with soil. In order to facilitate the management of sweet potato seeds and fresh potatoes for food and feed, separate cellars are used for storage. Seed potatoes are stored in special cellars by the production team, edible sweet potatoes are stored by the catering unit, and sweet potatoes for livestock feed are stored by the feeding group and sideline processing group. When sweet potatoes are put into cellars, four points must be strictly observed: 1. Spring and summer sweet potatoes are separated, different varieties are separated, and good and bad tubers are separated; 2. Gentle loading, unloading, and transportation are universally practiced; 3. Sweet potatoes that are scratched, forked, broken, diseased, insect-eaten, exposed to the sun, wet with mud, soaked in rain, or frosted are not put into cellars; 4. After sweet potatoes are put into cellars, sprinkle a layer of thin sand to keep the cellar dry. In addition, organize a professional sweet potato management team to manage the sweet potatoes from the time they enter the cellar to the end.

Vigorously carry out the slicing and drying of sweet potatoes, slicing and grinding into powder. Except for those selected for storage in cellars, the remaining portion should be sliced and dried. It is necessary to achieve immediate harvesting, slicing, and drying. At the same time, universally promote the experience of grinding fresh potatoes into powder to improve the powder yield.

In order to strengthen leadership and effectively do a good job in sweet potato collection, processing, and consumption, the commune established a guidance committee headed by Wang Yuying, the secretary in charge of agriculture. Each production team is headed by the branch secretary and forms a leading group, and each team also has a deputy team leader responsible for this work.

In order to summarize and promote the experience of this commune, the Heze Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting here with the participation of the agricultural secretaries of various county committees and the party committee secretaries of key communes.

    早作准备收好藏好用好甘薯
    阎什口公社针对具体情况订出具体措施
    保证收获不丢损、贮藏不霉烂、加工及时
    本报济南9日电　山东鄄城县阎什口公社，在加强晚秋后期管理的同时，发动群众总结经验，采取有效措施，展开了地瓜（即甘薯）收藏、加工的准备工作。
    这个公社今年共栽春、夏地瓜五万九千零八十二亩，占全社粮田面积的65.6％。收好、藏好、加工和食用好地瓜，对增加公社收入，改善社员生活，支援国家建设都有非常重要的意义。因此，公社党委在动员群众作好三秋工作时，开展了贮藏好、加工好、食用好地瓜的宣传，号召群众围绕收好、藏好、加工和食用好地瓜献计献策。同时又分片召开老农、技术员座谈会，总结了往年的经验，集思广益，提出了对地瓜的收、藏、加工和食用的有效措施。
    在收获方面，保证不丢损、不霉烂，力争霜降前收好。根据今年地瓜收刨任务重、用工多、时间紧迫的特点，以作业组为单位分片包干，逐块落实，使块块地瓜有人管。在收刨时间上，分两次突击：春地瓜于白露后五至七天收刨；夏地瓜在寒露左右收刨。为了使瓜块不碰伤、不霉烂、不损耗，在收刨中要作到轻放、轻拿、稳运，及时收、及时运、及时入窖，仔细挑出碰伤的薯块和病块。要改变过去用犁耕的粗收办法，普遍改用抓钩或粪杈收刨，并组织辅助劳力复收。
    根据今年雨水大，地下水位高、瓜块含水分多、不易贮藏的特点，在挖薯窖方面，除选择地势高、没积过肥和避风向阳的地方外，普遍采用半阴半阳的多室改良棚窖。即地下挖四尺深，地上接三尺高的墙，然后用土围上。为了便于看管瓜种、食用和饲料用的鲜薯，采取分窖贮藏。作种用的由生产队专窖保藏，食用地瓜归伙食单位保藏，家畜饲料用的地瓜归饲养组和副业加工组保藏。在地瓜入窖时，要严格掌握四点：一、春夏地瓜分开，不同品种分开，好坏瓜块分开；二、普遍作到轻装、轻卸、轻运；三、刨伤、杈伤、折断、病块、虫蚀、露头青、有湿泥的、水浸雨淋的、受霜冻的地瓜不入窖；四、地瓜入窖后，撒上一层薄沙土，保持窖内干燥。此外，组织地瓜保管专业队，从地瓜入窖开始，一管到底。
    大搞地瓜切片晒干，切丝打粉。除将选留入窖的以外，下余的部分切片晒干。要做到随收、随切、随晒。同时，普遍推广鲜薯打粉，提高出粉率的经验。
    为了加强领导，切实做好地瓜收藏、加工、食用工作，这个社以分管农业的书记王玉盈为首，建立了指导委员会。各生产队由支部书记挂帅，组成了领导小组，各小队也都有一名副小队长负责这一工作。
    为了总结推广这个社的经验，中共菏泽地委在这里召开了有各县委农业书记和重点公社党委书记参加的现场会议。（附图片）
