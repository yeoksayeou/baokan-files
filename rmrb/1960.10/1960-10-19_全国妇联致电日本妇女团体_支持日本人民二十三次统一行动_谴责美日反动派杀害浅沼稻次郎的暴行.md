Xinhua News Agency, October 18th: The All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) today sent a telegram to the Japanese Women's Groups Federation and forwarded it to the National Council to Prevent Revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," supporting the Japanese people and women in holding the 23rd unified action against the US-Japan military alliance treaty, and expressing the highest respect to the heroic Japanese people and women.

The telegram pointed out: "The Ikeda government not only disregards the just actions of the broad masses of the Japanese people who resolutely oppose the US-Japan military alliance treaty but also openly claims that the US-Japan military alliance treaty is the center of Japan's foreign policy. This policy of the Ikeda government, which follows the United States, is hostile to China, and revives Japanese militarism, violates the interests of the Japanese people and endangers peace in Asia and the world. Recently, the US-Japanese reactionaries even condoned fascist thugs in the despicable assassination of Japanese patriotic politician and Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Mr. Inejiro Asanuma, in an attempt to use bloody violence to intimidate the Japanese people who are striving for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. However, the heroic Japanese people and women cannot be intimidated. They are uniting more broadly and with greater determination and action to fight to the end to defeat US imperialism and its running dogs."

The telegram said: "Chinese women, along with the Chinese people, have always resolutely supported the just struggle of the Japanese people and women against the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people and the people of the world, US imperialism, and strongly condemn the shameless fascist atrocity of the US-Japanese reactionaries in assassinating Mr. Asanuma. Mr. Inejiro Asanuma, during his lifetime, together with the Japanese people, made important contributions to opposing US imperialism, opposing the revival of Japanese militarism, and promoting friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people. We express our deep condolences for Mr. Asanuma's death. We believe that the great strength and will of the Japanese people cannot be destroyed by any reactionaries, and the cause of the Japanese people and women against the US-Japan military alliance treaty and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will surely achieve final victory."

    全国妇联致电日本妇女团体
    支持日本人民二十三次统一行动
    谴责美日反动派杀害浅沼稻次郎的暴行
    新华社18日讯　全国妇女联合会今天致电日本妇女团体联合会并转阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，支持日本人民和妇女举行反对日美军事同盟条约的第二十三次统一行动，向英勇的日本人民和妇女致以最崇高的敬意。
    电报指出：“池田政府不仅无视日本广大人民坚决反对日美军事同盟条约的正义行动，而且公开声称日美军事同盟条约是日本对外政策的中心。池田政府这种追随美国、敌视中国、复活日本军国主义的政策，违反日本人民的利益，危害亚洲和世界的和平。最近，日美反动派竟纵容法西斯暴徒卑鄙地刺杀了日本爱国政治家、日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎先生，企图用血腥的暴力来威吓争取独立、民主、和平、中立的日本人民。但是，英勇的日本人民和妇女是吓不倒的，他们正更加广泛地团结起来，以更大的决心和行动为击败美帝国主义及其走狗而斗争到底。”
    电报说：“中国妇女和中国人民一道，始终不渝地坚决支持日本人民和妇女反对中日两国人民和世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义的正义斗争，严厉谴责日美反动派刺杀浅沼先生的无耻的法西斯暴行。浅沼稻次郎先生生前和日本人民一道为反对美帝国主义、反对日本军国主义的复活和促进中日两国人民友好作出了重要的贡献，对于浅沼先生的遇害，我们表示沉痛的哀悼。我们相信，日本人民的伟大力量和意志是任何反动派摧毁不了的，日本人民和妇女反对日美军事同盟条约和争取独立、民主、和平、中立的事业必将取得最后的胜利。”
