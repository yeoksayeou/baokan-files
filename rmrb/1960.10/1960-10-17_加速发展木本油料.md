Accelerate the Development of Woody Oil Crops

Increasing the production of vegetable oil crops can be achieved in two ways: one is to plant more herbaceous oil crops, and the other is to plant more woody oil crops. Because woody oil crops have many advantages, we should devote more effort to developing woody oil crops while continuing to plant more herbaceous oil crops.

Woody oil crops are more adaptable to the natural environment. They can be planted everywhere in mountainous or hilly areas, beside villages, roads, courtyards, or various scattered vacant lots. They have vast potential and do not compete with grain and cotton for land. Woody oil crops have deep roots and strong stems, strong resistance to disasters, and relatively stable production. Many kinds of woody oil crops can bear fruit for decades or even hundreds of years, while requiring very little labor each year. At present, most of the industrial oil used in the country comes from woody oil crops. In key producing areas (such as Jiangxi and Hunan provinces), woody edible oil, such as camellia oil, accounts for more than 50% of the local edible oil. Accelerating the development of woody oil crops is a good way to increase oil production quickly, efficiently, and economically, and will play a significant role in supporting national construction and improving people's lives.

China has a temperate climate, and mountains account for more than 70% of the country's total area. Many areas are suitable for planting woody oil crops. More than 50 kinds of woody oil crops with high economic value have been discovered throughout the country, including more than ten kinds with a relatively good production base, such as oil camellia, walnuts, tung oil trees, and Chinese tallow trees. For many years, mountain farmers have accumulated rich experience in cultivating woody oil crops. These are all favorable conditions for accelerating the development of woody oil crops. Some people may say that since woody oil crops have so many advantages and can be planted in large quantities in vast mountainous areas, why are they planted so little in many areas? This requires looking for reasons in the social and political aspects. Every farmer knows that planting woody oil crops is a "low-risk, high-return" endeavor. However, before liberation, it was impossible and unrealistic for poor farmers who barely had enough to eat to engage in this kind of production that would only yield benefits after several years and large-scale benefits after more than ten years. Even if each mu of camellia forest only cost a few workdays each year, they could not "afford" it before the benefits came. After liberation, the lives of the broad masses of farmers have been basically guaranteed. Under the vigorous advocacy and promotion of the Party and the government, the production of woody oil crops has begun to develop rapidly. Taking oil camellia as an example, the newly planted oil camellia area in the past ten years is about twice that of the early days of liberation. The output of camellia oil in 1959 increased about three times compared with 1950. Now, relying on the strength of the people's communes, we can rationally utilize land and labor, carry out unified planning and arrangements, and give full play to the superiority of collective ownership by communes and teams to solve the "underpinning" problem before woody oil crops gain benefits. As long as everyone attaches importance to this matter and grasps it tightly, the great development of woody oil crops can be expected within years.

To accelerate the development of woody oil crops, efforts should be made in two aspects: one is to expand the planting area, and the other is to strengthen management and improve total output and yield per unit area.

Expanding the planting area should be based on collective management, supplemented by individual management. All communes and production teams that can plant oil crops should make a comprehensive plan that includes land use, labor arrangements, forest species matching, annual progress, and other items, designate dedicated personnel for management, organize forces, and gradually realize it. At the same time, we should call on and organize the broad masses of commune members to plant woody oil crops on various vacant lots. Since 1957, the Shangluo Prefecture in Shaanxi Province has mobilized the masses to plant "one sheng of walnuts" per person. By 1959, more than 4,400 "walnut gullies" and more than 4,050 "walnut slopes" had been built, equivalent to more than 980,000 mu of walnut forest. Experience has proven that this is a good way to rapidly develop woody oil crops. All regions must quickly prepare seedlings so as to build a batch of oil forests in this winter-spring afforestation campaign.

At present, many regions have relatively extensive management of oil forests, and the output is quite low. This should and can be overcome. If we do not pay attention to management, each mu of oil camellia will only produce 40 to 50 jin of camellia seeds. If we invest five or six workdays to do a good job in loosening soil, weeding, fertilizing, and pest control, we can produce 200 jin of camellia seeds. It can be seen that all regions should make full use of the slack farming season this winter and next spring, organize a certain amount of labor, and do this matter well.

The harvesting season for woody oil is approaching. We should seize the season and harvest in a timely manner to avoid losses. In the past, the harvesting rate of woody oil in many regions was not high. The collection rate for oil camellia was generally only 80%, and for tung oil trees only 60%. If the harvesting rate of oil camellia and tung oil trees is increased by 10%, tens of thousands of tons of oil can be produced. We must harvest woody oil crops as carefully as we harvest grain, regardless of whether the trees are new or old, or whether the mountain fields are far or near, and strive to collect everything from the trees and pick up everything from the ground, leaving no tree behind and wasting no grain, to ensure a bumper harvest.

### 加速发展木本油料

    加速发展木本油料
    增产植物油料，有两个方法。一个是多种草本油料作物，一个是大种木本油料作物。由于木本油料作物有许多优点，我们在继续多种草木油料作物的同时，应该用更大的力量，发展木本油料作物。
    木本油料作物对自然环境的适应性较强，在山区或丘陵地区，在村旁、路边、庭院或各种零星隙地，到处都能种植；海阔天空，不与粮棉争地，木本油料作物根深杆壮，抗灾力强，生产比较稳定。许多种木本油料作物能结实几十年到百多年，每年用的工本却很少。目前全国工业用油的绝大部分来自木本油料作物；木本食用油，例如茶油，在重点产区（像江西、湖南等省），占当地食用油的50％以上。加速发展木本油料作物，是多快好省地增产油脂的好办法，对于支援国家建设，改善人民生活，都将发生重大的作用。
    我国气候温和，山地占国土总面积70％以上，很多地区都适宜种植木本油料作物；各地已发现的经济价值较高的木本油料作物已有五十多种，其中生产基础较好的油茶、核桃、油桐、乌桕等有十多种；多少年来，山区农民积累了丰富的培育木本油料作物的经验，这些都是加速发展木本油料的有利条件。有人也许会说，既然木本油料作物有这么许多优点，广大山区又能大量种植，为什么许多地区种的很少呢？这要从社会政治方面找原因。哪个农民都知道种植木本油料作物是“一本万利”的事情，可是，解放以前，对于吃了上顿没有下顿的贫苦农民来说，经营这种几年以后才有收益、十几年后才有大量收益的生产事业，是无能为力的，是不现实的，在还没有收益的时候，即使每亩油茶林每年只费几个工，他们也是“垫”不起的。解放以后，广大农民的生活有了基本的保障，在党和政府大力倡导、推动之下，木本油料的生产开始迅速发展起来。以油茶为例，十年来新造油茶面积相当解放初期的两倍左右；1959年茶油产量比1950年大约增加了三倍。现在，依靠人民公社的力量，可以合理地运用土地和劳力，可以进行统一的规划和安排，可以发挥社队集体所有的优越性，解决木本油料作物获得收益以前的“底垫”问题。只要大家重视这件事情，抓紧这件事情，木本油料作物的大发展，完全可以计年而待。
    加速发展木本油料作物，要从两个方面努力，一是扩大种植面积，一是加强经营管理，提高总产量和单位面积产量。
    扩大种植面积，以集体经营为主，个人经营为辅。凡是能够种植油料作物的公社和生产队，都应该作出一个包括土地的利用、劳力的安排、林种的搭配、每年的进度等等项目的全面规划，确定专人管理，组织力量，逐步实现。同时，应该号召和组织广大社员，利用各种隙地，大种木本油料作物。陕西省商雒专区从1957年开始，发动群众每人种“一升胡桃”；到1959年，已经营造了四千四百多条“胡桃沟”、四千零五十多个“胡桃坡”，折合胡桃林九十八万多亩。经验证明这是迅速发展木本油料的一个好办法。各个地区要赶紧把种苗准备妥当，以便在今冬明春的造林运动中，营造一批油料林。
    目前不少地区对油料林的经营管理比较粗放，产量相当低。这是应该而又可能克服的。如果不注意经营管理，每亩油茶只生产茶子四、五十斤；如果投入五、六个工，做好松土、除草、施肥、治虫等项工作，能生产茶子二百斤。可见各地应该充分利用今冬明春的农闲季节，组织一定的劳力，把这件事情作好。
    木本油料的采收季节已经到来，应该抓紧季节，及时采收，免得造成损失。过去，不少地区木本油料的采收率不算高，油茶一般只收到80％，油桐只收到60％。如果把油茶、油桐的采收率提高10％，就可以增产几万吨油脂。我们要像收获粮食一样细致地收获木本油料作物，林木不管新老，山场不分远近，力争树上采净，地上拣光，一株不漏，一粒不丢，保证做到丰产丰收。
