Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th - Radio of the Lao Fighting Forces broadcast on the 29th that Phoumi Vongvichit, head of the Lao Patriotic Front delegation negotiating with the Lao Kingdom government, delivered an important speech at the meeting of the two sides on October 19th. He elaborated on the Lao Patriotic Front's views on the current situation in Laos and put forward several suggestions for realizing the unity and cooperation of Lao patriotic forces.

Phoumi Vongvichit pointed out that the fate of Laos is on the verge of a very dangerous situation due to the interference and aggression of US imperialism and the activities of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique in opposing the line of peace, neutrality and national harmony. The urgent task of the Lao nation is to gather all forces to overcome the above crisis. This is precisely the task of this negotiation.

Phoumi Vongvichit said that, under the current circumstances, national harmony must be correctly implemented to conform to the interests of the motherland. The Kingdom government and the Lao Patriotic Front must unite all patriotic and peace-loving forces and direct the spearhead of struggle at the enemies of the Lao nation, US imperialism and the traitorous clique.

Phoumi Vongvichit said that in order to implement cooperation between patriotic and peace-loving forces, first of all cooperation between the Kingdom government and the Lao Patriotic Front, the Lao Patriotic Front delegation put forward the following six suggestions:

	One, in order to implement national unity, a coalition government must be established, including representatives of all nationalities, political parties, patriotic and peace-loving people - including representatives of the Lao Patriotic Front, the coup committee, the Peace and Neutrality Committee, etc.;

	Two, give the people genuine democratic and free rights;

	Three, ban all reactionary organizations established by the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique;

	Four, consolidate the Kingdom's army, unify all patriotic armed forces to safeguard national independence and neutrality;

	Five, according to the Geneva Agreement and the Vientiane Agreement and the Bandung Spirit, implement a genuine policy of peace and neutrality;

	Six, focus on developing the national economy and culture.

Phoumi Vongvichit also said that in order to facilitate mutual cooperation, the two sides must reach a consensus on the following specific issues: The Kingdom government must order the release of Lao Patriotic Front cadres and members and other patriots who were illegally arrested by the Phoumi Nosavan group in the past; the Kingdom government and the Lao Patriotic Front must closely cooperate in political and military aspects in the future in order to jointly resist the enemies of the nation; the Lao Patriotic Front declares that the local governments currently under its jurisdiction will accept the leadership of the supreme power of the Kingdom government; in addition to establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the Kingdom government must establish diplomatic relations as soon as possible with countries that are enthusiastic about Laos, such as neighboring countries such as the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Phoumi Vongvichit pointed out that the key to the current Lao problem lies in uniting all patriotic forces to resist the crisis threatening Laos. He emphasized that the problem between the Kingdom government and the Lao Patriotic Front is an internal problem, and as long as both sides are willing to fight to free the motherland from the threat of US imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, this internal problem can be properly resolved.

Phoumi Vongvichit finally expressed the hope that the Kingdom government will carefully study the opinions put forward by the Lao Patriotic Front, which are also the opinions of the Lao people. He hoped that the negotiations could continue in an atmosphere of closeness and mutual understanding and achieve good results.

    老挝爱国战线党代表团团长在万象谈判会议上说
    必须团结爱国力量抗击民族敌人
    指出当前的斗争锋芒应该指向美帝国主义和叛乱集团
    建议成立联合政府，统一爱国武装力量，实行和平中立
    新华社河内30日电　据寮国战斗部队电台29日广播，同老挝王国政府谈判的老挝爱国战线党代表团团长富米·冯维希在10月19日举行的双方谈判会议上发表重要讲话，阐述老挝爱国战线党对老挝当前局势的看法，并且提出了实现老挝爱国力量团结合作的若干建议。
    冯维希指出，老挝的命运，由于美帝国主义的干涉、侵略和富米·诺萨万叛国集团反对和平中立和民族和睦的路线的活动而濒于十分危险的局面。老挝民族的当急之务，是集合一切力量来战胜上述危机。这正是这次谈判的任务。
    冯维希说，在目前的情况下，必须正确地实行民族和睦以符合祖国的利益。王国政府和老挝爱国战线党必须团结一切爱国爱和平力量，把斗争的锋芒指向老挝民族的敌人美帝国主义和叛国集团。
    冯维希说，为了实行爱国爱和平力量之间的合作，首先是王国政府和老挝爱国战线党之间的合作，老挝爱国战线党代表团提出下列六项建议：
    一、为了实行全民团结，必须成立包括各民族、各政党、爱国爱和平人士的代表——其中包括老挝爱国战线党、政变委员会、和平中立委员会等的代表的联合政府；
    二、给予人民真正的民主自由权利；
    三、取缔由富米·诺萨万叛国集团成立的一切反动组织；
    四、巩固王国军队，把一切爱国武装力量统一起来，以保障民族的独立和中立；
    五、根据日内瓦协议和万象协议以及万隆精神，实行真正的和平中立政策；
    六、着重发展民族的经济和文化。
    冯维希又说，为了有利于互相间的合作，双方必须就下列具体问题取得一致的意见：王国政府必须下令释放过去被富米·诺萨万集团非法逮捕的老挝爱国战线党的干部和党员以及其他爱国人士；王国政府和老挝爱国战线党今后必须在政治和军事方面密切合作，以便共同抗击民族的敌人；老挝爱国战线党声明，目前仍然由它管辖的地方政权，将接受王国政府的最高权力的领导；除了同苏联建立外交关系之外，王国政府必须尽快地同对老挝具有热情的国家，如中华人民共和国、越南民主共和国等邻国建立外交关系。
    冯维希指出当前的老挝问题的关键所在，是团结一切爱国力量以抗击正在威胁老挝的危机。他强调说，王国政府和老挝爱国战线党之间的问题是内部问题，只要双方一致愿意为争取祖国摆脱美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万叛国集团的威胁而斗争，这个内部问题就能够妥善地加以解决。
    冯维希最后表示希望王国政府对老挝爱国战线党提出的意见，也即是老挝人民的意见，加以仔细研究。他希望谈判能够继续在亲密和互相谅解的气氛中进行，并取得良好结果。
