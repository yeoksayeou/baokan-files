Xinhua News Agency, 5th -- The Burmese sports delegation's football team played its second friendly match in China this afternoon at the Beijing Worker's Stadium, drawing 2-2 with the Chinese People's Liberation Army Beijing Unit football team. The score was 1-1 at halftime.

This was an unpredictable match. The Beijing Unit team was still trailing with only three minutes left in the ninety-minute game. However, in this crucial moment, they launched three consecutive attacks. The first two shots were caught by the guest team's goalkeeper, Ji Deng, but the final shot, a powerful strike near the penalty area by right winger Zhao Jingrong, finally broke through the opponent's goal, tying the score. At this point, only one minute remained in the game.

The Beijing Unit team, participating in an international competition for the first time, took the lead with a score of 1-0 just two minutes into the game. At that time, right inside forward Chang Yushan's shot was blocked by the guest team's goalkeeper, Ji Deng, but left inside forward Zhang Shixun followed up with a header, sending the ball over Ji Deng's head and into the goal. The audience erupted in applause.

After conceding the goal, the guest team launched a fierce counterattack, contesting every ball and playing very aggressively. Right midfielder Ding Ji, responsible for organizing the offense, passed accurately, frequently creating favorable attacking or shooting opportunities for the forwards. The two "dangerous" figures on the front line—right winger Ba Hadu and left inside forward Si Daer—were particularly active, often launching sudden attacks with their rapid running and skillful ball-handling techniques. After half an hour of play, Ba Hadu dribbled the ball quickly straight towards the home team's goal, scoring a goal and tying the score.

In the second half, the guest team often defended with six or seven players in the backfield while launching quick attacks whenever possible. After half an hour, Ba Hadu again gained possession in midfield. He dribbled the ball single-handedly towards the home team's goal, and with a running shot, defeated the home team's goalkeeper Huang Zhaowen again. Ba Hadu was not only fast but also had a strong ability to control the ball, often shaking off the defense of two or three home team players. His brilliant performance was frequently praised by the audience.

Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Fu Zhong, as well as Lieutenant General Liao Hansheng, Lieutenant General Li Zuopeng, Major General Li Xin, Vice Chairman of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission Cai Tingkai, Rong Gaotang, and others watched today's game and, after the game, went onto the field to shake hands and take photos with both teams.

### 缅甸足球队举行访华友谊赛

    缅甸足球队举行访华友谊赛
    新华社5日讯　缅甸体育代表团足球队今天下午在北京先农坛体育场举行访华第二场友谊比赛时，以二比二同中国人民解放军北京部队足球队踢成平局。上半场双方踢成一比一。
    这是一场变幻莫测的比赛，北京部队队直到全场九十分钟的比赛还剩最后三分钟时，比分还落后于对方，但就在这紧要关头，他们连续展开了三次猛攻，头两次射门都被客队守门员季登接在怀里，但最后一次由右边锋赵景荣在对方禁区附近的一脚劲射，终于攻进了对方球门，扳成了最后的平局。这时全场比赛只剩下最后一分钟。
    第一次参加国际比赛的北京部队队，今天在比赛才开始两分钟时，就攻入一球以一比零领先。当时，右内锋常玉山射出的球被客队守门员季登打出后，左内锋张世询赶上用头一顶，球从季登头上飞入球门，观众掌声四起。
    客队失球后展开猛烈反攻，每球必争，踢得十分积极。担任组织进攻任务的右前卫丁季传球准确，经常恰到好处地为前锋创造有利的进攻或射门机会。锋线上的两个“危险”人物——右边锋巴哈杜和左内锋斯达尔更是活跃，他们经常以快速的奔跑和熟练的带球技巧，展开突然的袭击。比赛进行了半个钟头时，巴哈杜就以快速的带球动作直奔主队球门，攻入一球扳成一平的。
    下半场客队一方面经常由六、七个人在后方防守，一方面一有机会就发动快攻。过了半个钟头，巴哈杜又在中场得球，他带球单枪匹马冲向主队球门，在跑动中抬脚猛射，又使主队守门员黄肇文失守。巴哈杜不仅跑得快，而且控制球的能力很强，经常能摆脱主队两三个人的防守。他的精采表演不时博得观众的称赞。
    国务院副总理李富春，中国人民解放军总政治部副主任傅钟上将，以及廖汉生中将、李作鹏中将、李信少将，国家体育运动委员会副主任蔡廷锴、荣高棠等，观看了今天的比赛，并且在比赛结束后，到运动场上与双方队员握手、合影。（附图片）
