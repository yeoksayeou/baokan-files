Presented to the Japanese Theatre Troupe

Since the Zhongyuan period two thousand years ago①,
The relations between the two countries are like strings and winds.
Even if dark clouds obscure the bright moon,
Eventually, the red sun will rise from the Abyss of Yu.
Jianzhen, blind, still sailed the seas②,
Abe's remains still lie in the fields③.
The Edo and Yellow Rivers flow into the same gully,
Together, we stir up the wind and clouds to build a new world.

Presented to the Head of the Japanese Theatre Troupe
    Murayama Tomoyoshi

Cultural exchange is constantly being refreshed,
Reuniting after three years, our affection has doubled.
Friendship combines teacher and friend, we sit together as one,
Speaking of children, tears fill our eyes.
Even if waves and disturbances cross the mountains and seas,
    We must use our voices to speak for the people.
    Let us wait and see the red flag rising in the wind,
    Sweeping away the dust of ten thousand zhang from heaven and earth.

Note: ① In the second year of Zhongyuan of Emperor Guangwu of the Han Dynasty (57 AD),
      Wa (Japan) sent envoys to the Han, which marked the beginning of formal communication between Japan and our
      country.
    ② The eminent monk Jianzhen of the Tang Dynasty crossed
      to Japan in the twelfth year of Tianbao (753 AD) after he went blind. His mummy
      is now preserved in Toshodaiji Temple in Nara, Japan.
    ③ The Japanese student studying in Tang Dynasty, Abe no Nakamaro,
      whose Chinese name was Chao Heng, rose to the position of Jiedushi. He stayed in
      China for more than fifty years and died in Chang'an in 770 AD.

      *Twilight Crane*

    The profound and subtle feeling is silent,
    The warm intention is harmonious.
    Snow presses down on the heavy feathered robe,
    Mouth blows on the red charcoal fire.
    Once the merchants come to the market,
    The whole room turns into a cage.
    Seek a new world elsewhere,
    Spread your wings and fly into the clouds.

      *Dead Sea*

    How did the Dead Sea die?
    It's all because of American imperialism's madness.
    Those who lead the wolf into the house,
    Are running dogs acting as ghosts.
    The fishermen stir up public anger,
    Flames of anger radiate light.
    The Dead Sea will become a living sea,
    The time is not far off.

      *A Woman's Life*

    Making a fortune in the war of aggression,
    The family fell apart due to the scourge of war.
    Those who play with fire are burned by fire,
    We only see them come to power but not step down.
    Repenting for disaster, we know the heroine Qin,
    Some people are still slaves while they are still intoxicated.
    Who expected that after Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
    They would turn to Wall Street for bombs?

      *Recitation Theatre Three Kinds*

    The people are the masters,
    Struggling and persisting without letting go.
    Rather die than let people sell the country,
    It's hard to hope for birds to return to their cages to survive.
    Workers, peasants, merchants, and students are newly united,
    Latin America, Africa, and Asia are good brothers.
    Raise the red flag on Mount Fuji,
    Soon you will see a sky full of red over Fusang (Japan).

    赠日本话剧团〔诗六首〕
    郭沫若
  赠日本话剧团
  中元以降二千年①，
  两国相交似管弦。
  纵有乌云遮皓月，
  终教红日出虞渊。
  鉴真盲目犹航海②，
  阿倍遗骸尚在田③。
  江户黄河归一壑，
  风云共卷建新天。赠日本话剧团团长
    村山知义
  文化交流与日新，
  三年重见倍相亲。
  谊兼师友身同席，
  话到儿童泪满巾。
  纵有波澜横海岳，
    要将喉舌替人民。
    伫看赤帜迎风起，
    一扫乾坤万丈尘。注：①汉光武中元二年（公元57年）
      倭国遣使入汉，此为日本与我
      国正式交通之始。
    ②唐代名僧鉴真和尚盲目后，以
      天宝十二年（公元753年）渡
      日。其肉身今存日本奈良唐招
      提寺。
    ③日本留唐学生阿倍仲麻吕，中
      国名晁衡，官至节度使。留中
      国五十余年，以公元770年死
      于长安。
      《夕　鹤》幽玄情默默，温暖意融融。雪压羽衣重，口吹炭火红。一朝来市侩，举室变牢笼。别寻新世界，振翮入云中。
      《死　海》死海何由死？乃因美帝狂。引狼入室者，走狗作鬼伥。渔民动公愤，怒火放光芒。死海成活海，为时已不长。《女人的一生》侵略战中发暴财，一家零落遘兵灾。由来玩火焚于火，只见上台没下台。悔祸能知钦女杰，沉酣未醒有奴才。谁期广岛长崎后，反向花旗要弹来？朗诵剧三种人民才是主人翁，争斗坚持没放松。宁死不教人卖国，求生难望鸟归笼。工农商学新团结，拉美亚非好弟兄。富士山头扬赤帜，扶桑行见满天红。
