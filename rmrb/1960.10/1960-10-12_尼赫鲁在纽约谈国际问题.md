Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from New York: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who is attending the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, gave a television talk in New York on the 8th on some current international issues.

    Regarding the issue of restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, he said that it is necessary for the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations as the representative of China. He couldn't see how issues such as disarmament, or any truly important issue, could be resolved without China's participation. When talking about India's attitude on this issue, Nehru believed that India did not take the lead this year but merely supported the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations, because it believed that "due to the border incident," the Indian government "did not need to be too involved" in this matter.

    When discussing the Western countries' colonial system, Nehru declared that the political stage of the empire was over, but its economic part still continued to exist in many ways, but it was clearly something that was declining. He believed that the Soviet Union's proposal on completely eliminating the colonial system and immediately declaring the independence of colonies was "vaguely worded." He said, "I will support the proposal that the right of any country to independence must be recognized." But at the same time, he emphasized that "preparatory" work must be carried out in this regard. He said, "How to implement this proposal remains to be resolved." Nehru expressed disagreement with the Western counter-accusation that the Soviet Union was pursuing "colonialism." He said: "It is wrong to use the word 'colonialism' against the Soviet Union." But then he said that "the Soviet Union is controlling, and even to some extent exploiting, a certain situation or a certain country for its own benefit."

    Nehru also said that, in his opinion, "Western countries are not enthusiastic about melting the ice (easing international tensions); they prefer the current situation." But he then said: "Perhaps Khrushchev is the same."

    When discussing the issue of disarmament, Nehru expressed his support for the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a special session of the United Nations General Assembly at the beginning of next year to discuss this issue. He said he "believes that Khrushchev wants disarmament; he does not want war." But at the same time, he concealed the Western countries' position of obstructing the resolution of the disarmament issue, saying that the West also "wants disarmament," but there are only "doubts and worries about disarmament."

    Regarding the situation in the Congo, Nehru, on the one hand, believed that the United Nations itself should not replace the Congolese parliament "temporarily act as the power holder, and become the trustee," nor should the United Nations deal with "third parties" other than the president and prime minister appointed by the parliament; on the other hand, he avoided the fact that the United States used the United Nations to invade the Congo, and advocated further UN intervention in the Congo. He said that the United Nations "must encourage the current (Congolese) parliament to hold meetings, and put pressure on its own leaders to force them to seek compromise or do something." He also said that the Indian government "hopes that new elections (in the Congo) can be held, and hopes that the parliament can replace its leaders."

    Nehru left New York on the 9th and returned home via London and Bonn. When he passed through London on the 10th, he said at a press conference held at the airport when answering a question about what he thought about the attendance of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Khrushchev at the United Nations General Assembly, "Unfortunately, it is obvious that the people there are angry with each other, and after Mr. Khrushchev arrived, if there is anything to say, the anger there has increased."

    尼赫鲁在纽约谈国际问题
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：出席联合国大会第十五届会议的印度总理尼赫鲁8日在纽约就当前的一些国际问题发表电视谈话。
    他谈到关于恢复中国在联合国中的合法权利的问题说，人民中国代表中国参加联合国是必要的。他看不出如果没有中国参加，像裁军之类的问题或任何确实重要的问题怎么能够解决。在谈到印度在这个问题上的态度时，尼赫鲁认为，印度今年并没有带头提出而仅仅是支持关于恢复中国在联合国中的席位，这是因为它认为“由于边境事件”，印度政府在这个问题上“没有必要管得太多”。
    尼赫鲁在谈到西方国家的殖民制度时宣称，帝国的政治阶段已经过去了，不过其经济部分仍然以许多方式继续存在，但是它显然是正在衰微的东西。他认为，苏联提出的关于彻底消除殖民制度、立即宣布殖民地独立的建议是“措辞含糊的”。他说，“我将支持这样的建议，就是必须承认任何国家独立的权利。”但是他同时又强调在这方面必须进行“准备”工作。他说，“怎样把这个建议付诸实施，那还有待解决。”尼赫鲁表示不同意西方反诬苏联推行“殖民主义”。他说：“针对苏联来使用‘殖民主义’这个字眼是错误的”。但是他又说什么“苏联正在为了自身的利益而控制着、甚至在某种程度上利用着某种局势或者某个国家”。
    尼赫鲁还说，在他看来，“西方国家对于使冰融解（缓和国际紧张局势）并不热心，他们比较喜欢目前的情况。”但是他接着说：“或许赫鲁晓夫也是这样”。
    在谈到裁军问题时，尼赫鲁表示支持苏联提出的关于在明年年初召开联合国大会特别会议来讨论这个问题的建议。他说他“相信赫鲁晓夫希望裁军，他不希望发生战争。”但是他同时又掩饰西方国家阻挠解决裁军问题的立场，说什么西方也“希望裁军”，只是“对裁军存在疑虑和担心”而已。
    谈到刚果局势时，尼赫鲁一方面认为不能由联合国本身来代替刚果议会“暂时充当掌权者，成为受托管理者”，也不能让联合国同议会任命的总统和总理以外的“第三者”打交道；另一方面又避开美国利用联合国侵略刚果的事实，而主张联合国进一步干涉刚果。他说，联合国“必须鼓励（刚果）目前的议会举行会议，并且对它自己的领袖们施压力，迫使他们求得妥协或者做某种事情”。他还说，印度政府“希望（在刚果）新选举能够举行，希望议会能更换它的领导人。”
    尼赫鲁已在9日离开纽约取道伦敦和波恩等地回国。他10日路过伦敦时在机场举行的记者招待会上在回答他对苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫出席联合国大会一事有什么想法的问题时说，“不幸明显的是，那里的人彼此发怒，在赫鲁晓夫先生抵达后，如果有什么可说的话，那里的怒气增加了。”
