Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 27th: The vast number of young people and masses in the Jiguang People's Commune in Zhongjiang County, Sichuan Province, the hometown of the special-class hero Huang Jiguang of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, are taking the heroic spirit of Huang Jiguang as an example, vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, striving to become stronger, and building the hero's hometown. In the mid-October ten-thousand-person assessment and inspection in Zhongjiang County, this commune was rated as a "Ten-Good" Red Flag Commune in the county with its excellent achievements in autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and autumn plowing, realizing their guarantee to present a gift to the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

Jiguang Commune was originally a barren hilly area. However, under the leadership of the Party and inspired by the heroic spirit of Huang Jiguang, the youth and masses of the entire commune worked diligently, struggled hard, and fully utilized the superiority of the people's commune, overcoming various difficulties and changing the face of the hero's hometown. The commune members said that as long as we have the fearless spirit of Huang Jiguang, no difficulty can stop us. This summer, Jiguang Commune suffered a severe drought. Li Fucheng, a demobilized soldier of the former Volunteer Army and a member of the Communist Party, said: Huang Jiguang used his chest to block the machine gun muzzle to ensure the victory of the battle. What is the drought we are encountering now? He organized twenty young and middle-aged commune members, using fourteen waterwheels connected into a long dragon, working in shifts day and night, drawing water up the mountain to rescue the seedlings. Some management areas even continuously fought the drought for more than ten days and nights, resulting in ensuring increased rice production. Precisely because of this tenacious spirit, Jiguang Commune and Jiguang Management Area have maintained the title of Red Flag Unit for several years.

    学习英雄的精神大办农业大办粮食
    继光公社青年艰苦奋斗建设家乡
    据新华社成都27日电　中国人民志愿军特级英雄黄继光烈士的故乡——四川中江县继光人民公社的广大青年和群众，以英雄黄继光的英勇精神作为榜样，大办农业，大办粮食，发愤图强，建设英雄的家乡。在10月中旬中江县的万人评比检查中，这个公社以秋收、秋种、秋耕等各方面生产和工作的优异成绩，被评为全县的“十好”红旗公社，实现了他们给中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战十周年献礼的保证。
    继光公社原来是一个贫瘠的丘陵地区。但是，全社青年和群众在党的领导下，在黄继光英雄精神的鼓舞下，埋头苦干，艰苦奋斗，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，战胜各种困难，改变了英雄故乡的面貌。社员们说，只要有黄继光那样的大无畏精神，没有什么困难能够阻挡我们。今年夏天，继光公社遭到严重干旱。前志愿军复员军人、共产党员李福成说：黄继光用自己胸膛顶住机关枪眼，保证了战斗的胜利。我们现在遇到的干旱算得了什么？他组织起二十个青、壮年社员，用十四架水车接成一道长龙，日夜分班，车水上山抢救禾苗。有的管理区还连续抗旱十几个昼夜，结果，保证了水稻增产。正是有着这样坚韧不拔的精神，几年来，继光公社和继光管理区一直保持着红旗单位的称号。
