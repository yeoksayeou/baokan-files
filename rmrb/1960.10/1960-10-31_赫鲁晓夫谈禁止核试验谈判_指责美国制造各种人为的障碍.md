Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 29th: TASS reported that on October 21st, the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, stated in a telegram to the leaders of the Executive Committee of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom that the United States' policy in the nuclear test ban negotiations has aroused the legitimate concern of all peace-loving people in the world.

This telegram was Khrushchev's response to a resolution on banning nuclear tests sent to him by the committee.

Khrushchev pointed out that recently, the United States has been clamoring more and more frequently to fundamentally cancel the Geneva negotiations and resume nuclear weapons testing. He wrote: The work of the Geneva Conference has stalled, and in recent months, it has not formulated any provisions. He said that the reason for this situation is that Western countries, primarily the United States, are creating various artificial obstacles on the road to a complete ban on all types of nuclear weapons testing.

The telegram stated that the United States is attempting to make people doubt the possibility of reaching a comprehensive agreement on banning nuclear tests and is trying every possible means to exclude partial nuclear explosions from the scope of the ban.

In this telegram, Khrushchev reiterated the Soviet Union's position that it remains ready to make every effort to conclude an agreement banning the testing of nuclear weapons as soon as possible, and then to completely ban and eliminate nuclear weapons.

    赫鲁晓夫谈禁止核试验谈判
    指责美国制造各种人为的障碍
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科29日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫10月21日在给国际妇女争取和平自由同盟执行委员会领导人的电报中指出，美国在禁止核试验谈判中的政策引起世界所有爱好和平的人民的合理的不安。
    这份电报是赫鲁晓夫对委员会寄给他的一份关于禁止核试验的决议的回答。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，近来，美国越来越经常地叫嚷要根本取消日内瓦谈判，并恢复核武器试验。他写道：日内瓦会议的工作停顿下来了，近几个月，它没有制订出任何条款。他说，产生这种情况的原因在于，西方国家、首先是美国，在通往完全禁止各种核武器试验的道路上制造各种人为的障碍。
    电报中说，美国企图使人们怀疑有就禁止核试验达成无所不包的协议的可能性，并千方百计地要想把核爆炸部分放在禁止范围之外。
    赫鲁晓夫在这封电报中重申了苏联仍然准备尽一切努力争取尽快地缔结禁止试验核武器的协议、然后根本禁止和取消核武器的立场。
