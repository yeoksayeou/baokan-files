    Xinhua News Agency, September 30th. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, and Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, held a banquet at noon today to warmly welcome the delegation of the Japanese National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty, led by delegation leader Takeo Tobe; the delegation of the Japanese Peace Committee, led by delegation leader Kenjiro Yanagida; and the delegation of the Japanese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, led by delegation leader Tokumatsu Sakamoto, who are visiting China and attending the National Day celebrations.

    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, spoke first at the banquet. He said that the visit of Japanese friends to China has brought us the profound friendship of the Japanese people towards the Chinese people, and the great victory of the Japanese people in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty has greatly encouraged us.

    Guo Moruo said that the Japanese people have achieved great success in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. The scale, scope, and duration of this movement are rarely seen in history. It has made great contributions to the cause of defending peace, to the unity of the Japanese people, to the unity of the Asian people, and to the struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

    Guo Moruo pointed out that the victory of the Japanese people is also the victory of the Chinese people, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and all peace-loving people in the world. He said: We sincerely hope that the Japanese people can unite further and achieve more complete victories.

    Guo Moruo concluded: The Chinese people will support the struggle of the Japanese people with all our strength. We will always stand on the side of the Japanese people's just struggle, and we are willing to join hands with the Japanese people, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and all peace-loving people in the world to fight to the end for our common cause.

    Takeo Tobe, head of the delegation of the Japanese National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty, spoke at the banquet, recounting the struggle of the Japanese National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty against the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and preventing the revision of the treaty. He also pointed out: "We have issued a declaration refusing to recognize this treaty and are continuing to resist it."

    Takeo Tobe said: "We, the Japanese people, express our determination that, as the sovereign power of the country, we will never allow the Japanese government to launch a war of aggression that brings disaster to other countries."

    Takeo Tobe said: We will mobilize all forces to actively work for the normalization of Japan-China relations, for the improvement of the lives of the Japanese people and the independence of Japan, and for world peace.

    Kenjiro Yanagida, head of the Japanese Peace Committee delegation, who is visiting China for the second time, pointed out in his speech that the forces of peace have achieved an unprecedented magnitude in the history of mankind throughout the world. The awareness of the people of the world has been raised, and they can prevent imperialism from launching wars.

    He said: Imperialism wants to provoke wars, while socialist countries are working for peace.

    He pointed out: "Socialist countries have achieved advantages in economic, military, cultural, and educational fields. No matter how imperialism struggles, it is impossible to defeat socialism again, and it can only be defeated." He said that the working people all over the world recognize that the enemy is imperialism and monopoly capital, and have strengthened international unity to fight against the capitalist world system.

    Tokumatsu Sakamoto, head of the Japanese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity delegation, emphasized in his speech that a country with foreign military bases, foreign troops stationed, and a military alliance treaty signed with imperialism cannot be considered completely independent. The Japanese people are united against the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty in order to achieve complete independence.

    He said that they express their respect for the efforts made by the Chinese people in the struggle for independence. The Japanese people have learned many good things not only from the great achievements of the Chinese revolution, but also from the long process of the Chinese revolution.

    Finally, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, delivered a speech at the banquet. He expressed his gratitude to the Japanese people for their strong support for China since the liberation of China, especially in the past two years. He said that in the past two years, when imperialism tried every means to launch attacks against us and attempt to provoke an anti-China movement, tens of millions of Japanese people held high the banner of China-Japan friendship in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.

    He pointed out that in the ten years since the founding of New China, U.S. imperialism has tried its best to divide the Chinese and Japanese people. U.S. imperialism's pursuit of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is to prevent the people of China and Japan from being friendly, but the fact is just the opposite. U.S. imperialism's pursuit of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty has strengthened the unity of the Chinese and Japanese people. As Chairman Mao said, it turned bad things into good things. In the future, we have greater determination, more experience and ability to turn more bad things into good things. He said that the unity of the Chinese and Japanese people is becoming increasingly consolidated, like the rising sun in the east, which is irresistible.

    The banquet was filled with a warm, friendly, and united atmosphere. In warm applause, Japanese friends presented the China Peace Committee with souvenirs such as bamboo water buckets, more than two feet long bamboo pipes, and headscarves worn by Japanese women in peace marches, which were used as weapons in the struggle by the Japanese people. Guo Moruo put the headscarf on his head, which aroused prolonged applause and laughter.

    Attending the banquet as companions were Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the China Peace Committee; Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity; Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries; and relevant figures from all walks of life Yang Hansheng, Xia Yan, Hu Yuzhi, Xu Guangping, Qu Tangliang, Zhao Puchu, Zhao Anbo, Wu Maosun, Chen Yu, Zheng Senyu, Xie Nanguang, Lao She, Yang Jin and others.

    Japanese peace activist in Beijing, Kinkazu Saionji, and Korean peace activist Hwang Bong-koo were also invited to attend today's banquet.

    中国人民永远站在日本人民正义斗争的一边
    郭沫若廖承志欢宴日本客人
    新华社30日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若和中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志今天中午举行宴会，热烈欢迎应邀来我国访问并参加国庆典礼的以团长户叶武为首的日本阻止修改安全条约国民会议代表团、以团长柳田谦十郎为首的日本和平委员会代表团和以团长坂本德松为首的日本亚非团结委员会代表团。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若首先在宴会上讲话。他说，日本朋友这次来我国访问，给我们带来日本人民对中国人民的深厚友情，日本人民在反对日美安全条约的斗争中的伟大胜利，使我们受到很大的鼓舞。
    郭沫若说，日本人民在反对日美安全条约的斗争中得到了伟大成就。这一运动的规模之大、范围之广和时间的持久，在历史上都是很少有的。它对保卫和平的事业、对日本人民的团结和对亚洲人民的团结以及对反对帝国主义、殖民主义的斗争，都有很大的贡献。
    郭沫若指出，日本人民的胜利也是中国人民，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民，和全世界爱好和平的人民的胜利。他说：我们衷心希望日本人民能够更进一步地团结起来，取得更彻底的胜利。
    郭沫若最后说：中国人民是要以全力支持日本人民的斗争的。我们永远站在日本人民正义斗争的一边，并且愿意与日本人民，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民和全世界爱好和平的人民携起手来，为我们的共同事业斗争到底。
    日本阻止修改安全条约国民会议代表团团长户叶武在宴会上讲话，他叙述了日本阻止修改安全条约国民会议为反对日美安全条约和阻止条约的修改所进行的斗争情况，他并且指出：“我们曾经发表了不承认这一条约的宣言，并继续进行着抵抗它的斗争”。
    户叶武说：“我们日本人民表示这样的决心：作为国家的主权者，我们决不让日本政府发动给别国带来灾难的侵略战争。”
    户叶武说：我们将动员一切力量，为日中邦交的正常化、为日本人民生活的改善和日本的独立，为世界和平作积极的努力。
    第二次来中国访问的日本和平委员会代表团团长柳田谦十郎在讲话中指出，和平力量已在全世界范围内取得了人类历史上从未有过的壮大。世界人民的觉悟提高了，就能阻止着帝国主义发动战争。
    他说：帝国主义要挑起战争，而社会主义国家在为和平而努力。
    他指出：“社会主义国家在经济、军事、文化、教育各方面都取得了优势。尽管帝国主义怎样挣扎，也不可能再战胜社会主义，只能遭到失败。”他说，全世界劳动人民都认识到敌人是帝国主义、垄断资本，并加强了国际上的团结来向资本主义世界体系作斗争。
    日本亚非团结委员会代表团团长坂本德松在讲话中强调说，一个有外国军事基地、驻有外国军队、和帝国主义签订了军事同盟条约的国家，就不能算是完全独立，日本人民为了获得完全独立，一致起来反对日美安全条约。
    他说，他们对中国人民在为争取独立的斗争中所作的努力，表示敬意，日本人民不仅在中国革命的伟大成就中，而且在中国革命漫长的过程中学到很多好东西。
    最后，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志在宴会上致词。他十分感谢日本人民自中国解放以来，特别是近两年来对中国的强有力的支持。他说，两年来，当帝国主义想尽一切办法，向我们发动进攻和企图挑起反华运动时，几千万日本人民在反对日美安全条约的斗争中，高高地举起了中日友好的旗帜。
    他指出，新中国成立十年来，美帝国主义处心积虑地分化中日人民，美帝国主义搞日美安全条约，就是不让中日两国人民友好，但事实恰恰相反，美帝国主义搞日美安全条约，反而加强了中日两国人民的团结，正如毛主席所讲，把坏事变成了好事，今后，我们有更大的决心，更多的经验和能力，把更多的坏事变成好事。他说，中日人民的团结日益巩固，如旭日东升，是不可抗拒的。
    宴会上充满了热情、友好、团结的气氛，日本朋友，在热烈的掌声中把日本人民在斗争中作为武器的竹水桶、二尺多长的竹烟斗和日本妇女在和平游行中戴的头巾等纪念品，赠送给中国人民保卫世界和平委员会。郭沫若把头巾戴在自己的头上，激起了经久不息的掌声和笑声。
    出席今天宴会作陪的，有中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席包尔汉，中国亚非团结委员会副主席李德全，中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南和有关各界人士阳翰笙、夏衍、胡愈之、许广平、区棠亮、赵扑初、赵安博、吴茂荪、陈宇、郑森禹、谢南光、老舍、杨进等。
    日本在京和平人士西园寺公一和朝鲜和平人士黄凤九也应邀出席了今天的宴会。
