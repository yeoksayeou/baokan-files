    Ren Yintang, Sweet Potato Storage Expert
    Ren Yintang, a member of the Jizhuang Management Area of the Dongfeng Commune in Xinding County, Shanxi Province, is an expert in storing sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes he is responsible for storing have not spoiled for three years.

    In the past, this management area lost many sweet potatoes each year to rot due to poor storage. Ren Yintang, a Communist Party member, sought advice from various experts and friends to learn sweet potato storage techniques, and carefully studied the changes in sweet potatoes during storage. He finally found a sweet potato storage cellar that maintained the proper temperature. Based on local climate and geological conditions, he created a "非" (fei - non-) shaped cellar. This type of cellar has an opening about three feet in diameter, widening as it goes down. It is dug down about twenty feet, and then side cellars are dug. Six or seven side cellars are dug in one cellar, arranged like the character "非". After the sweet potatoes are placed in the cellar, the opening is not sealed for up to half a month. Afterwards, the cellar opening is gradually reduced as the weather changes, until it is completely sealed. To prevent cold air from entering, grass curtains are hung over the side cellar openings. In spring, as the weather warms up, the cellar opening is gradually enlarged, so that the cellar always maintains a temperature of about twelve degrees Celsius.

    藏薯能手任银堂
    山西省忻定县东风公社季庄管理区社员任银堂，是保管甘薯的能手，他负责贮藏的甘薯三年没有坏过。
    这个管理区过去因为甘薯保存不好，每年都有很多霉烂。共产党员任银堂到处寻师访友，学习贮藏甘薯的经验，并且细心考查甘薯贮藏阶段的变化规律。他终于找到了保存甘薯需要适当气温的藏薯窖，他根据当地气候和地质条件，创造了“非”字形窖。这种窖窖口直径三尺左右，越往下越宽，下挖两丈左右，再打旁窖，一个窖内打六、七个旁窖，排列像个“非”字，甘薯入窖后半个月以内不封口，以后，随着天气的变化逐渐缩小窖口，直至完全封闭。为了防止冷空气入侵，在旁窖口要挂草帘。到春季，随着天气转暖，逐步放大窖口，使窖内始终保持摄氏十二度左右。
