Editor's Note:

	Breaking the Old and Establishing the New is a Never-Ending Process

	The Tonghua Dalizi Iron Mine has concentrated its originally dispersed manpower and equipment into several major mining areas and working faces to implement centralized operations. This approach more effectively utilizes manpower, equipment, time, and space, opening up a new path for the mine's production to achieve an all-round leap forward in greater, faster, better, and more economical ways.

	For many years, mining has generally been carried out in a decentralized manner. Now, changing to centralized operations is a major transformation in mine production organization. In the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement, mine production has undergone many changes. Aren't many mines now largely mechanized or semi-mechanized, even basically eliminating heavy manual labor? Haven't many mines created diverse mining methods tailored to local geological conditions? Haven't many mines created new types of supports such as cement to replace wooden supports? ... All of this shows that old habits and old production methods are constantly changing.

	After the mining method of promoting centralized operations is implemented, new problems and new contradictions will continue to arise. For example, as mining efficiency increases and output increases, ore extraction and transportation may appear relatively backward for a certain period; as production organization becomes more centralized, management work must also change accordingly. These all require continuous improvement and continuous transformation. As long as we liberate our minds, break down superstitions, and combine this with scientific analysis and a spirit of seeking truth from facts, a vast and boundless world will unfold before us. In the mines, continuously carrying out technical and management innovations will continuously improve the mine's production capacity, producing more ore to ensure the continuous leap forward of steel production.

    破旧立新永无止境
    通化大栗子铁矿把原来分散的人力、设备集中到几个主要采区、工作面上，实行集中作业。这一做法更有效地利用了人力、设备、时间、空间，为矿山生产实现多快好省全面跃进又打开了一条新途径。
    多年来，采矿一般都是分散作业，现在改为集中作业，这是矿山生产组织的一项重大变革。在全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动中，矿山生产经历了很多次的变革。现在不是有许多矿山大部实现了机械化半机械化，甚至基本上消灭了笨重体力劳动了吗？不是有许多矿山根据当地的地质条件，因地制宜地创造了多种多样的采矿方法吗？不是有许多矿山创造了水泥等新型支柱代替了木支柱吗？……所有这些，都说明旧的习惯旧的生产方法都不断在改变。
    推广集中作业的采矿方法以后，还会不断出现新问题、新矛盾。例如采矿效率提高了，产量增加了，出矿和运输就可能在一定时期中相对地显得落后；生产组织集中了，管理工作也必须随之改变。这些都需要不断的提高，不断地变革。只要解放思想，破除迷信，并且和科学分析，和实事求是的精神相结合，我们的面前就会展开广阔无限的天地。在矿山里，不断进行技术上、管理上的革新，就将不断提高矿山的生产能力，生产出更多的矿石来保证钢铁生产不断跃进。
