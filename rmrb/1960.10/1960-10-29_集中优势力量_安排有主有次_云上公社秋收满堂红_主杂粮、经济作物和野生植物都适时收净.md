    Concentrating Superior Forces, Arranging Priorities
    Yunshang Commune Achieves a Bumper Autumn Harvest
    Ensuring Timely Collection of Main Grains, Cash Crops, and Wild Plants
    (Our newspaper, Guiyang, 28th dispatch) The Yunshang Commune in Wangmo County, Guizhou Province, using over 90% of its labor force, vigorously grasped the final stages of grain harvesting and autumn plowing and planting, basically achieving timely collection of main grains, cash crops, and wild plant materials. The commune completed the harvest of grain crops twenty days earlier than last year. The collection of cotton, walnuts, chestnuts, *Quercus aliena* acorns, wild hemp, and other wild plants also increased by approximately 12% to 40% compared to the same period last year.
    This year, the Yunshang Commune expanded its corn planting area by two times compared to last year; wild starch, fiber, and other plants numbered in the dozens, were widely distributed, and matured at different times. In order to collect all kinds of wealth fully, well, and cleanly, the Commune Party Committee launched a comprehensive autumn and small autumn crop inventory and total collection campaign throughout the commune. Twice, with the production team as the unit, they organized surveys of the maturity status of crops in fields, mountains, and around houses, demanding that all naturally grown and wild crops be gathered into storage, achieving a "bumper harvest." During the survey, they comprehensively categorized various crops, varieties, and maturity periods, and each contracted team arranged harvesting periods one by one, assigned tasks to groups and individuals, and contracted to complete them. The teams first concentrated their efforts to harvest rice, corn, and miscellaneous grains that matured early, had large yields, and were time-sensitive in batches and phases. At the same time, they arranged for weaker members to harvest scattered cotton, walnuts, chestnuts, *Quercus aliena* acorns, and other products in a flexible manner, prioritizing major tasks while taking care of minor ones, ensuring that both strong and auxiliary labor forces had their uses. Commune-run industries also extracted labor and fully invested in the "Three Autumns" following the principle of being both workers and farmers, farming during the busy season, and working during the slack season. Schools were given agricultural leave, and picking teams and small autumn harvest groups were organized to actively support the large autumn harvest and small autumn harvest. With this arrangement, 85% of the commune's agricultural labor force was used to rush harvest grain and autumn plowing and planting, 10% of the labor force was invested in the small autumn harvest, and 5% of the weaker labor force picked cotton and gleaned ears of grain. It is planned that in late October, after most of the autumn plowing and planting tasks are completed, the commune's small autumn harvest labor force will be increased to 30%, and more labor will be organized for short-term comprehensive concentrated harvesting of large-scale wild products.
    During the harvest, each production team and production group in the commune formed shock teams, contracted out pieces of land, implemented small-section contracting, and set different quotas according to the difficulty of crop harvesting, technical skill required, and distance, assigning tasks to individuals, setting time, quality, quantity, and work point requirements, carrying out on-site inspections and evaluations, and small-scale competitions, so that harvesting efficiency continued to improve.
    In order to adapt to the doubled harvesting efficiency, the commune promptly mobilized more than five hundred packhorses and forty-odd rubber-wheeled carts, oxcarts, and handcarts to improve transportation efficiency. The entire commune relied mainly on vehicles and packhorse transportation, supplemented by manual carrying, and established a transportation network of collection points. Each team divided up the harvest area, selected sites in the area to place baskets, so that products harvested in small areas were first concentrated at the points, then transported to main roads and highways for centralized transfer, and transported by horses or oxen to designated locations for drying and storage. This not only greatly improved the volume of transportation and reduced manual carrying, but also saved a lot of labor. In the past, most areas of the commune mainly adopted the method of each household carrying grain home, and the daily grain harvesting progress was 500 *mu*. After changing to a method based on ox and horse transportation and small-scale centralized transshipment, 54 laborers were saved every day, and the harvesting progress reached more than 1,000 *mu*, with an average of more than 15,000 *jin* of grain transported each day.
    While doing a good job in autumn plowing and planting, the entire commune launched a small autumn harvest movement. The commune established a small autumn harvest office, and the management area and production team established small autumn harvest command posts (groups) to strengthen leadership. Local commercial departments cooperated with the small autumn harvest movement, increased purchasing points, went deep into the field for purchasing, provided processing technical guidance, actively publicized price policies, and organized the masses to pick, process, and transport at the same time, paying according to quality, with cash on the spot, effectively promoting the continuous development of the small autumn harvest movement.

    集中优势力量　安排有主有次
    云上公社秋收满堂红
    主杂粮、经济作物和野生植物都适时收净
    本报贵阳28日电　贵州省望谟县云上公社以90％以上劳力，狠抓粮食收获扫尾和秋耕秋种，基本作到了主杂粮、经济作物和野生植物原料适时收净。全社粮食作物比去年提前二十天收获结束，棉花、核桃、板栗、青杠子、野麻等野生植物，也分别比去年同期采摘量增加12％至40％左右。
    云上公社今年玉米种植面积比去年扩大两倍；野生淀粉、纤维等植物多达数十种，分布广，成熟期不一致。公社党委为了把各种财富收全、收好、收净，在全社范围内开展了大秋和小秋作物普查全收活动。先后两次以生产队为单位，组织了查田地、山上、五旁四坎作物成熟状况，要求家生野生，颗粒归仓，收个“满堂红”。在普查中，对各种作物、品种、成熟期进行全面分类站队，由包产小队逐一排定收割期，落实到组到人，包干完成。各小队首先集中力量分期分批突击收获成熟早、收成多、时间性强的水稻、玉米、杂粮；同时安排体力较弱的社员，机动收获零星分散的棉花、核桃、板栗、青杠子等产品，作到有主有次，主次兼顾，强劳力和辅助劳力都有用武之地。社办工业也根据亦工亦农，农忙务农，农闲做工的原则，抽出劳力全部投入“三秋”。学校放农忙假，组织拣粮队和小秋收组等，积极支援大秋收和小秋收。这样安排下来，全社的农业劳动力，有85％的抢收粮食和秋耕秋种，10％的劳力投入小秋收，5％的弱劳力拣棉、拾穗。计划10月下旬，在秋耕秋种任务大部完成后，全社小秋收劳力，将增加到30％，大宗野生产品还要组织更多劳力短期全面突击采摘。
    收获中，全公社各生产队和生产小队，组成突击组，分片包干，实行小段包工，按照作物收割难易、技术高低、距离远近，分别订出不同定额，把任务落实到人，定时定质定量定工分，开展现场检查评比，和小范围竞赛，使抢收效率不断提高。
    为了适应收割效率成倍增长，公社及时调动五百多匹驮马和四十多部胶轮车、牛车、手推车，提高运输工效。全社以车辆、驮马运输为主，人挑为辅，建点设站构成运输网。各小队划出收获片，片上选点安置箩兜，使小范围收割的产品先集中在点，然后运至大路和公路集中转运，用马驮或牛拉到指定地点，翻晒储存。这样不仅大大提高了运输量，减少了人挑背驮，还节省了很多劳力。过去，全社绝大部分地区主要采取回家个个挑粮的办法，日收割粮食的进度为五百亩，改为牛马运输为主和小片集中转运的办法后，每天节约五十四个劳力，收获进度达一千多亩，每天平均要多运一万五千多斤粮食。
    在搞好秋耕秋种同时，全社掀起了小秋收运动。公社成立了小秋收办公室，管理区、生产队成立了小秋收指挥所（组），加强领导。当地商业部门配合小秋收运动，增设收购点，深入现场收购，进行加工技术指导，积极宣传价格政策，组织群众边采摘、边加工、边运输，依质论价，现货现款收购，有效地促进了小秋收运动不断向前发展。（附图片）
