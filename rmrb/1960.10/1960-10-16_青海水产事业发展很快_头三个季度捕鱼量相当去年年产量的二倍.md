(Our report) The emerging aquatic industry in Qinghai Province is developing rapidly. In the first three quarters of this year, the more than 10,000 workers and fishermen on the aquatic front have caught over 26,000 tons of fresh fish, according to incomplete statistics, which is equivalent to twice the total catch of last year. This not only met the needs of the province but also transferred some to Beijing, Gansu, and other places.

During the summer fishing season, fishing teams and groups composed of cadres, employees of enterprises, and commune members marched vigorously to various fish-producing bases. Centered on Qinghai Lake, China's largest inland lake, from Zaling Lake and Eling Lake in the upper reaches of the Yellow River in the south to the rivers at the foot of the Qilian Mountains in the north, from the banks of the Huangshui River in the east to the lakes on the Tanggula Mountains in the west, people were casting nets and sailing boats. In addition to catching large quantities of Qinghai's specialty, the Huang fish, they also widely fished for carp, crucian carp, Ming fish, and grass shrimp.

Qinghai Province has over 20 million mu of water area. Many lakes have a high density of fish, such as Qinghai Lake and Zaling Lake, which are known as "living fish warehouses." Before liberation, due to the exploitation by reactionary rule and numerous fish taxes, aquatic products were rarely developed and utilized. In 1949, the province only produced 255 tons of fish. After liberation, Qinghai Province's fishery has developed rapidly. Now, small shipyards and net processing factories have been built in areas with abundant aquatic resources, and deep-sea fishing has been carried out, enabling production throughout the year. On Qinghai Lake, the largest fishing base, a ring road, meteorological station, and wharf have been built. New fishing villages have been built around the lake in Heima River, Jiangxi Gou, and Buha River.

The abundant fish harvest in Qinghai Province this year is mainly due to the Party's further strengthening of leadership in the aquatic industry. During the peak fishing season, the Qinghai Provincial Fishing Production Headquarters was established on the shore of Qinghai Lake, and Sun Junyi, member of the Standing Committee of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Governor, personally took charge and directed the operations. Leading cadres from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Commerce and Party organizations at all levels went deep into the front lines of production, mobilizing the masses to launch a great fish-catching battle. The broad masses of fishery workers and fishermen launched a "five comparisons" competition, comparing ideology, enthusiasm, net frequency, output, and task completion. They overcame the changeable climate and various difficulties, enabling the highest daily output to reach more than 500,000 jin. The Buha River and Heima River fishing grounds created a record of catching 40,000 jin of fish in a single net. The workers fighting in the newly opened Zaling Lake fishing ground caught up quickly, improved fishing techniques, and increased the number of nets cast, increasing the daily output to 150,000 jin and creating a high-yield record of catching 70,000 jin of fish in a single net several times. In order to continuously increase output, each fishing ground and fishing team also widely carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, focusing on the links that consume a lot of labor, such as pulling nets and loading vehicles. They used winches to replace manual net pulling and "cablewayization" for short-distance transportation, which greatly improved efficiency and output.

While catching large quantities, local fishing grounds and commercial, transportation, and other departments have actively carried out the transfer, processing, and storage of fresh fish, adhering to the spirit of "looking ahead and behind, taking care of the off-season during the peak season, and taking care of next year this year." The Xining Cold Storage has already refrigerated and pickled a large number of fresh fish. State-owned fishing grounds, prefectures, counties, and fishing teams from organs and organizations have adopted methods such as sun-drying and salt-curing to process and store locally. Several aquatic product processing plants are also being built on the shore of Qinghai Lake, and more than ten kinds of products have been made while building the factory, testing, and producing.

    青海水产事业发展很快
    头三个季度捕鱼量相当去年年产量的二倍
    本报讯　青海省新兴的水产事业发展很快。万余名水产战线上的职工和渔民，在今年头三个季度，据不完全统计已捕获鲜鱼二万六千多吨，相当于去年全年捕获量的二倍，不仅供应了本省的需要，还外调了一部分到北京、甘肃等地。
    夏季鱼汛时，由机关、企业的干部、职工和公社社员组成的一支支捕鱼队、捕鱼组，浩浩荡荡地开到各个鱼产基地。以我国最大的内陆湖——青海湖为中心，南起黄河上游的札陵湖、鄂陵湖，北至祁连山麓的河流，东到湟水滨，西至唐古拉山上的湖泊，都有人们在摇船撒网。他们除了大量捕获青海特产的湟鱼以外，还广泛捕捞鲤鱼、鲫鱼、明鱼、草虾等。
    青海省水域面积有二千多万亩，许多湖泊中鱼的密度很大，如青海湖、札陵湖就有“活鱼库”之称。解放前由于反动统治的压榨和鱼税繁多，水产很少被开发利用。1949年，全省仅产鱼二百五十五吨。解放后，青海省的渔业得到很快的发展。现在，水产资源较多的地方建起了小型造船厂、网具加工厂，开展了深水捕捞，一年四季都能生产。在最大的渔业基地青海湖上，已经修建了环湖公路、气象站、码头，在湖周围的黑马河、江西沟、布哈河等地建成了新的渔民村。
    青海省今年鱼产丰收，主要是由于党进一步加强了对水产事业的领导。在鱼汛旺季，青海湖畔成立了青海省捕鱼生产总指挥部，中共青海省委常委、副省长孙君一亲自挂帅，坐镇指挥。青海省商业厅负责干部以及各级党组织领导干部深入生产第一线，发动群众展开夺鱼大战。广大渔场职工和渔民掀起了比思想、比干劲、比网次、比产量、比完成任务的“五比”竞赛热潮。他们战胜了多变的气候，克服了重重困难，使最高日产达到五十余万斤，布哈河、黑马河渔场分别创造了一网捕鱼四万斤的丰产纪录。战斗在新辟的札陵湖渔场的职工，奋起直追，改进捕鱼技术，增加下网次数，使日产量提高到十五万斤，并几次创造一网捕鱼七万斤的高产纪录。为了不断提高产量，各渔场、捕鱼队还针对拉网、装车等占用劳力多的环节，广泛开展了技术革新、技术革命运动，采用绞盘代替人工拉网，和短途运输“索道化”，使工效和产量都大为提高。
    在大量捕捞的同时，各地渔场和商业、运输等部门都本着“瞻前顾后，旺季照顾淡季，今年照顾明年”的精神，积极开展了鲜鱼的调运、加工储存工作。西宁冷藏库已经冷藏和腌制了大批鲜鱼。国营渔场、各州、县和机关、团体的捕鱼队，都采取晒干、盐腌等办法，就地加工储存。青海湖畔还正在兴建几座水产加工厂，并且在边建厂、边试验、边生产中制成了十多种产品。（附图片）
