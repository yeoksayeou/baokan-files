    Objective Laws Are Not Mysterious
    Zhu Jindai, Worker of Shanghai State Cotton Mill No. 17

    The relationship between objective laws and subjective initiative is actually the relationship between the objective and the subjective. Objective laws exist independently of human will. However, through practical activities, people can give play to their subjective initiative, recognize objective laws, and utilize them to transform the objective world. Therefore, on the one hand, people must break superstition and not be "slaves" to objective laws; on the other hand, they must explore objective laws and, on the basis of understanding them, maximize their subjective initiative.

    Some people are intimidated by the four characters "objective laws." When objective laws are mentioned, they feel that they are mysterious, profound, and unattainable. They do not understand that since laws exist objectively, and people can gradually recognize and grasp them through practice, what is so mysterious about them? Since the emergence of mankind on Earth, humans have been fighting against nature, gradually recognizing and mastering the laws of nature and production. For example, we are able to grow grain and other crops in agriculture because we have gradually mastered the growth laws of various crops. We are able to manufacture various machines for production in industry because we have gradually mastered the laws of making machines. We often hear people say that something was done correctly, so it was successful; something was not done correctly, so it was not successful. In fact, "correctly" and "incorrectly" refer to whether something conforms to or does not conform to objective laws. In our textile factory, there are many experienced veteran workers who are very experienced in repairing broken machines. With just a glance, a touch, or a listen, they can find the problem and quickly fix it. If you ask them why, they will say: "I can't explain the principle, but years of experience tell me that it must be repaired this way." In fact, these veteran workers have gradually mastered the operating laws of the machines because they have thoroughly understood the performance of the machines in years of production practice. Therefore, they have a "clear understanding" of broken machines and can repair them "skillfully," but they have not yet summarized these experiences well and raised them to the level of theory.

    Marxist-Leninist philosophy tells us that laws are the essential and necessary connections between phenomena. Therefore, finding laws is also finding the internal connections of things. Wang Zhengling of Changzhou Dacheng No. 1 Factory created the new measure for accelerating looms—"fast, small, loose"—based on analyzing the internal connections between these three elements. When the machine is fast, the inertia is large, so the shuttle driving force can be reduced relatively. If the shuttle driving force is smaller, the shuttle braking force can be looser, thus opening up a new path for acceleration. It can be seen that finding objective laws and actively applying them can avoid detours or prevent mistakes in work, thus better carrying out creative labor.

    Things are constantly developing, so our understanding has no end. This means that if we want to develop production, we must constantly explore objective laws and search for new paths. When an objective process shifts and transforms from one stage to another, to keep our subjective understanding abreast, we must further explore and master the objective laws under the new conditions. For example, the current technical revolution movement is continuing to consolidate, promote, and improve, and is constantly moving forward, but some comrades feel it is difficult. What is the reason for this? One of the reasons is that we have not studied well, have not mastered, or have not fully mastered objective laws, especially objective laws under the new conditions. For example, we built an electric automatic weft selecting machine in our factory's loom workshop. This is a new project that has a great effect on reducing labor intensity and increasing labor productivity. In the beginning, because people used to turn the bobbin a few times with their hands to grab the yarn end and pull it up. Now, several iron rods are used instead, which are not as dexterous as human hands, so the bobbin could not wrap around the yarn end. After the failure, through research, according to the characteristic of light yarn ends, the "pneumatic" method was adopted to blow the yarn end upward and let it fly downwards, so that the roller wrapped around the yarn end. This is the result of people constantly recognizing and mastering the objective laws of things in practice.

    Of course, mastering objective laws is not easy. Without fully exerting subjective initiative and without painstaking research, there is no question of mastering objective laws. Therefore, on the one hand, we must break the superstition of the "mystery" of objective laws; on the other hand, we must redouble our efforts and conscientiously sum up experience from practice to constantly recognize and master objective laws, and promote production to leap forward again and again!

    客观规律并不神秘
    上海国棉十七厂工人　朱金大
    客观规律和主观能动性之间的关系，实际上就是客观同主观之间的关系。客观规律是不依赖于人的意志而独立存在的。但是人们通过实践活动，发挥了主观能动性，就可以认识客观规律，利用客观规律，从而改造客观世界。所以，人们一方面要打破迷信，不做客观规律的“奴隶”，另一方面也要探索客观规律，在认识客观规律的基础上，最大限度地发挥主观能动作用。
    有些人被客观规律四个字吓倒了，一提到客观规律，就觉得这是一种神秘莫测、深奥无比、高不可攀的东西。他们不了解，规律既然是客观存在的，人们通过实践又可以逐步认识和掌握它，那还有什么神秘呢？地球上自从有人类以来，就一直在和自然界作斗争，逐步认识和掌握自然界和生产的规律。例如我们在农业上所以能种出粮食和其他作物，就是因为我们逐步掌握了各种农作物的生长规律。工业上所以能造出各种机器为生产服务，就是因为我们逐步掌握了造机器的规律。我们平时听大家说，这一件事情做对头了，所以成功了；那一件事情做得不对头，所以未成功。实际上这个“对头”与“不对头”，就是指符合与不符合客观规律。在我们纺织厂中有许多老师傅，对修理坏车的经验很丰富，只要用眼一看、手一摸、耳一听，就能找出毛病，很快就修好了。你问他是什么道理，他会说：“道理我讲不出，但是多年的经验告诉我非这样修理不可。”实际上，这些老工人由于在多年的生产实践中摸透了机器的性能，也就逐步掌握了机器的运转规律，所以碰到坏车他才能“了如指掌”，修理起来也“得心应手”，只不过他们还没有很好地总结这些经验，把它提高到理论上罢了。
    马列主义哲学告诉我们：规律是现象之间的本质联系、必然联系。因此，寻找规律也就是找事物的内部联系。常州大成一厂王正铃创造的布机加速新措施——“快、小、松”，就是根据“快、小、松”这三者之间的内部联系来进行分析的。车子快了，惯性就大，相对的就可以减小投梭力。投梭力小一些，制梭力就可以松一些，从而为加速开辟了新的途径。可见找寻客观规律，能动地运用客观规律，在工作中就能少走或不走弯路，从而更好的进行创造性劳动。
    事物是在不断地向前发展的，因此我们的认识也就没有止境。这就是说：我们要发展生产，就必须不断地探求客观规律，摸索新的道路。当客观过程从某一个阶段向另一个阶段推移转变的时候，要使自己的主观认识跟上去，就必须进一步摸索和掌握新条件下的客观规律。例如当前的技术革命运动正在继续巩固、推广、提高，不断向前发展，有些同志觉得有困难。这是什么原因呢？原因之一是我们还没有很好地钻研，没有掌握或者还没有完全掌握客观规律，特别是新条件下的客观规律。例如我们厂布机间搞了一座电气自动拣纡机，这是一个新的项目，对减轻劳动强度和提高劳动生产率有很大作用。开始时，由于原来这是人用双手把筒管转几转，捉住纱头拉起来的。现在用几根铁棒代替，不及人手那样灵巧，因而筒管绕不住纱头。在失败以后，经过研究，按照纱头轻的特点，采用“风动”方法，吹起纱头向下飞飘，才使滚筒绕住了纱头。这就是人们在实践中不断认识和掌握事物的客观规律的结果。
    当然，掌握客观规律也不是轻而易举的，不充分发挥主观能动性，不经过刻苦的钻研，就谈不上掌握客观规律。因此，我们一方面要破除客观规律“神秘”的迷信，另一方面更必须大鼓干劲，踏踏实实地从实践中不断总结经验，才能不断地认识和掌握客观规律，促使生产跃进、再跃进！
