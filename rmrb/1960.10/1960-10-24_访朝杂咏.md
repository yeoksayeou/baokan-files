    Miscellaneous Poems on a Visit to Korea
    Xie Yun
    In August of this year, I accompanied the delegation of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association to Korea to participate in the grand celebration of the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea and to pay a visit. During this period, I wrote a few poems, which are now published to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.
    Friendship
    No deeper friendship than sharing weal and woe,
    The Chinese and Korean people, sharing life and death.
    Even if seas run dry and rocks crumble, and heaven and earth unite,
    Our battle friendship will last forever.
    Panmunjom
    Visiting Panmunjom by day,
    Spending the night at Laifeng Manor. (Note)
    The signs of defeat are everywhere,
    And the U.S. imperialists dare to be rampant!
    Note: Laifeng Manor is located in the suburbs of Kaesong. The initial Korean armistice talks were held there. Representatives of the American invading army once came here under a white flag.
    On the Pyongwon Road (Note)
    The road twists, the peaks are strange, the Pyongwon Road,
    The rivers and mountains in the rain are exceptionally charming.
    The trenches on the mountain peaks are still faintly visible,
    Pointing out the heroes of that year.
    Note: Pyongwon Road refers to the Pyongyang-Wonsan Highway. While in Korea, we drove from Pyongyang to Wonsan in the rain. The driver was a former soldier of the Korean People's Army, who told us heroic stories of the War for the Liberation of the Motherland.
    Meeting with the Widow of Martyr Park Jae-geun (Note)
    Coming thousands of miles to meet,
    A deep kinship of flesh and blood.
    The man is gone, but the green mountains remain,
    Forever remembering Park Jae-geun.
    Note: When the delegation was in Wonsan, the widow of internationalist martyr Park Jae-geun and Volunteer Army Mother Ju Fuli traveled a long distance to meet with the delegation.
    Meeting with Comrade Ju Fuli (Note)
    Mother remembers her sons and daughters, longing for reunion day after day.
    Seeing loved ones today, her heart is joyful, and tears well up.
    Ten thousand words cannot express it all, I send you my best wishes.
    Follow Chairman Mao closely, and make great contributions to national construction.
    Note: Comrade Ju Fuli is a well-known Volunteer Army Mother. When meeting with the delegation, she said many sincere and emotional words, and only a general idea can be recorded here.

    访朝杂咏
    谢云
    今年八月，曾随中朝友好协会代表团去朝鲜参加朝鲜解放十五周年庆祝盛典，并进行访问。在此期间，写了几首诗，现在发表，以纪念中国人民志愿军参加抗美援朝战争十周年。
    友谊
    深交莫过共患难，
    中朝人民同死生。
    海枯石烂天地合，
    战斗友谊万古存。
    板门店
    日访板门店，
    夜宿来凤庄。（注）
    败迹历历在，
    美帝敢猖狂！
    注：来凤庄，位于开城城郊。朝鲜停战谈判最初曾于该地举行。美国侵略军代表曾打白旗来此。
    平元道上（注）
    路曲峰奇平元道，
    雨里江山分外娇。
    山头壕堑依稀在，
    指点当年话英豪。
    注：平元道，指平壤至元山公路。在朝时曾冒雨驱车自平壤至元山。驾驶员同志乃当年朝鲜人民军战士，沿途为我们讲述当年抗美卫国战争中的英勇故事。
    会见朴在根烈士夫人（注）
    千里来相见，
    骨肉情谊深。
    人殁青山在，
    永记朴在根。
    注：代表团在元山时，国际主义烈士朴在根同志夫人与志愿军妈妈具富力同志曾远道赶来会见代表团。
    会见具富力同志（注）
    妈妈忆儿女，日日望重逢。
    今日见亲人，心欢眼泪涌。
    万言无从说，寄语多保重。
    紧跟毛主席，建国立大功。
    注：具富力同志是有名的志愿军妈妈。在会见代表团时，她曾说了许多充满诚挚感情的话，这里只能记录了一个大意。
