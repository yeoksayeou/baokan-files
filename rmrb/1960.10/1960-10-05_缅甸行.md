    Trip to Burma
    Lin Lin
    The peacock is a symbol of good fortune. Our peacock
  dances beside the Shwedagon Pagoda; your peacock
  dances before Tiananmen Square. Peacocks spread their tails again and again, mutually wishing good fortune to neighbors and relatives. Recalling the days of anti-imperialist war, we supported and sympathized with each other for independence and sovereignty, and paid with lives and blood. Now friendly treaties are signed,
    friendly agreements are signed, and cultural exchanges help the development of friendship. The common desire is to defend world peace. The Nu River and the Salween River are originally the same river. We drink the water from the river's head, and you drink the water from the river's tail. The water from the river's head and tail, ah, is equally clear and equally sweet. We are not only close neighbors but also close relatives.
  "Paukphaw" in the Burmese dictionary is exactly "compatriot brothers," no wonder we visit each other so frequently, sending each other off and welcoming each other in turn. We swam in Inle Lake, the scenery is like that of Jiangnan. It's really fast to paddle with your feet, and the floating islands are full of vegetable gardens and orchards. We climbed Dongchun Peak, the scenery is like that of Kunming. Flowers bloom all over the trees, dazzling red, with clear blue clouds and clear weather. The white wine is fragrant, the coconut milk is sweet, and the friendship in our memory is even more fragrant and sweet than them. You give us brocade bags, filled with golden and jade-like sentiments; you give us precious knives, showing brotherly trust. The peacock is a symbol of good fortune. Our peacock
  dances beside the Shwedagon Pagoda; your peacock
  dances before Tiananmen Square. Peacocks spread their tails again and again, mutually wishing good fortune to neighbors and relatives.

    缅甸行
    林林孔雀是吉祥的象征，我们的孔雀，
  舞到大金塔边；你们的孔雀
  舞到天安门前，孔雀开屏再开屏，互向亲邻祝贺吉祥。回忆在反帝战争的日子里，彼此为着独立和主权，我们互相支持和同情，并且付出生命和血汗。现在签订了友好的条约，
    签订了友好的协定，文化往来有助友情的发展，共同的愿望是保卫世界和平。怒江、萨尔温江，本是同一条江。我们喝江头的水，你们喝江尾的水，江头江尾的水呵，一样清呵一样甘。既是近邻，也是近亲，
  “胞波”在缅文辞典里，正是同胞弟兄呵，怪不得这么往来频频，一下子相送，一下子相迎。我们游过茵丽湖，风景像江南，用脚划桨真快速，浮岛满是菜园和果园。我们登上东春峰，风景像昆明，花开满树照眼红，蔚蓝云彩天气清。白酒香，椰浆甜，友谊在记忆中，比它们更香更甜。给我们赠送锦袋，满装金玉般的情意；给我们赠送宝刀，显示兄弟般的信义。孔雀是吉祥的象征，我们的孔雀
  舞到大金塔边；你们的孔雀
  舞到天安门前，孔雀开屏再开屏，互向亲邻祝贺吉祥。
