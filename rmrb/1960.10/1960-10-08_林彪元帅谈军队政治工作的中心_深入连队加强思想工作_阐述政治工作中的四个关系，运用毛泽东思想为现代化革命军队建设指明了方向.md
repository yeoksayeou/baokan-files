Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Marshal Lin Biao recently gave extremely important instructions on the issue of political work in the People's Liberation Army at a conference of senior cadres of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He pointed out four relationships and four principles in the field of political work, made good use of and developed Mao Zedong Thought, and charted the course for political work and the construction of the entire army in the new period of building a modernized revolutionary army.

Marshal Lin Biao said that our army's political work has a very good tradition, is guided by Chairman Mao's thought, has many instructions and examples from Chairman Mao, and has a good foundation. He pointed out that political work has progressed in recent years, but the shortcoming is that not enough attention has been paid to ideological issues. However, since May of this year, 120,000 cadres from the entire army have gone down to the companies and grassroots levels to carry out the "Three-Eight Working Style" campaign and vigorously engage in political and ideological work. The situation has quickly changed, and great achievements have been made, with a new atmosphere.

Marshal Lin Biao said that political work is very important work. Just as Chairman Mao said, political work is the lifeline of our army, the commander, the soul, and the guarantee of all work. To do a good job, we must rely on the leadership of the Party, on political work, on the mass line, and on the people's consciousness. He emphasized that we must now grasp ideology, shift the focus of our work to ideology, shift the working method from the organs to the companies, from the upper level to the lower level, and mobilize the masses to do the work. Political work is the Communist Party's mass work in the army, just like the work of mobilizing the masses in the localities. We are mobilizing the masses who are armed and wearing military uniforms. When the masses are mobilized, and ideology is combined with people, there will be strength. He said that we are required to grasp the thinking below and implement the thinking above. Ideological battles are very important battles. If we don't fight ideological battles well, we won't be able to fight other battles well.

Marshal Lin Biao pointed out that in the field of political work, there are four issues that are interrelated:

    First, the relationship between weapons and people. In war, both weapons and people are needed, but weapons are used by people. If people are not brave, weapons cannot be fully utilized. Therefore, the victory of war still depends on people. After atomic bombs and shells are fired, when approaching the enemy within tens of meters, we still have to rely on people's bravery, high awareness, and spirit of sacrifice. If you can go up and occupy the position during an attack, you can achieve victory; if you can withstand the attack during a defense, you can defeat the enemy. This is the key issue in determining victory. We must pay attention to both weapons and people, but we must pay more attention to the role of people. The spiritual atomic bomb, that is, people's ideological awareness and bravery, is much stronger and more useful than the material atomic bomb. Moreover, only we can do this, and our enemies cannot. Therefore, this is exclusive to us, and imperialism cannot compete with us in this regard.

    Second, the relationship between various tasks and political work. The army's work includes the work of the headquarters, logistics work, military training, cultural education, etc. But if political work is done well, and people's initiative and creativity are brought into play, all kinds of work can be done well. Starting from this link, everything will be connected. If political work is done well, ideology can manage people, politics can manage people, and people can manage people, and the troops can be well managed. Chairman Mao built the army by first engaging in political work and establishing the army on a political basis. When political work is done well, people's awareness, initiative, and creativity will be brought into full play.

    Third, the relationship between various tasks in political work and ideological work. Political work also has various kinds of work, some of which are administrative and administrative, and some are ideological. All kinds of work must be done, and we cannot only do one, but the focus must be on ideological work. The Communist Party wants to implement the Party's policies among the masses, which is to carry out education based on the needs of the masses and based on living issues, and cannot be abstract.

    Fourth, the relationship between bookish ideas and living ideas. Books are also needed, but the important thing is living ideas. Books must also be combined with reality. What problems does the army have, what policies does the central government have, and what is the international situation like? These are not in the books. We must take reality as the center and use the proletarian viewpoint and the principles of Marxism-Leninism to answer these questions. Ideological work must reflect reality and must be carried out according to the actual situation. This is materialism. Chairman Mao made thorough explanations in the reports "Reform Our Study," "Rectify the Three Styles," and "Oppose Party Eight-Legged Essays." The main thing is to grasp living ideas, understand the ideological dynamics below, arrange work according to the central government's thinking, and answer questions with the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint. Books are necessary, but when conducting book education, we must connect it with reality. Political work should enable the situation above to be transmitted to the lower levels and the situation below to be transmitted to the upper levels, and there should be no blockage. The main department of the political department is the propaganda department, which is the department that does ideological work.

Marshal Lin Biao called for concentrating forces and breaking through the gap, just like fighting a battle. Now, we must break through the gap of ideological work in the field of political work, so that political work can be improved and the work can be done better.

    林彪元帅谈军队政治工作的中心
    深入连队加强思想工作
    阐述政治工作中的四个关系，运用毛泽东思想为现代化革命军队建设指明了方向
    新华社7日讯　林彪元帅在最近一次中国人民解放军高级干部会议上，就人民解放军政治工作问题做了极为重要的指示，指出了政治工作领域中的四个关系，四个原则，对毛泽东思想作了很好地运用和发挥，为我军在建设现代化革命军队的新的时期中政治工作和整个军队建设指明了方向。
    林彪元帅说，我军政治工作有很好的传统，有毛主席的思想领导，有毛主席的很多指示和范例，有很好的基础。他指出，几年来的政治工作是前进了，缺点是对思想问题注意得不够。但从今年5月以来，全军有十二万干部下连队，下基层，开展培养三八作风运动，大搞政治思想工作，情况很快就转变过来了，有很大的成绩，有了新气象。
    林彪元帅说，政治工作是很重要的工作，正像毛主席说的，政治工作是我军生命线，是统帅，是灵魂，是一切工作的保证。做好工作要靠党的领导，靠政治工作，靠群众路线，靠人的觉悟。他强调指出，我们现在要抓思想，把工作重点转到思想上来，工作方法从机关转到连队，从上层转到下层，发动群众来做工作。政治工作就是共产党在军队中的群众工作，和地方上发动群众的工作一样，我们是发动拿武器、穿军衣的群众。把群众发动起来，思想和人结合起来，就有了力量。他说，我们要求抓下面的思想，贯彻上面的思想。思想仗是很重要的战斗，不打好思想仗，其他仗就打不好。
    林彪元帅指出，政治工作领域中，有四个问题是相互有关系的，这就是：
    一是武器和人的关系。打仗时武器也要，人也要，但武器是要人去使用的，人不勇敢，武器就不能充分发挥作用，所以战争的胜利还是靠人。当原子弹、炮弹打过以后，到接近敌人几十米时，还是要靠人的勇敢，靠人的高度觉悟和牺牲精神。进攻时你能上去占领阵地，才能取得胜利；防御时你能顶得住攻击，才能打垮敌人。这是决定胜利的关键问题。武器和人这两方面我们都要搞，但更要重视人的作用。精神的原子弹，即人的思想觉悟、人的勇敢，这比物质的原子弹强得多，有用得多，而且这只有我们办得到，我们的敌人是办不到的，因而这是我们专有的，是帝国主义无法同我们比赛的。
    二是各种工作和政治工作的关系。军队工作有司令部工作，后勤工作，军事训练，文化教育，等等，但政治工作作好了，人的积极性创造性发挥起来了，各种工作就都能做好。从这一环着手，一通百通。政治工作做好了，思想可以管人，政治可以管人，人也可以管人，部队就可以搞得好。毛主席建军，首先是搞政治工作，把军队建立在政治基础上，政治工作做好了，人的觉悟，人的积极性、创造性就会最充分的发挥出来。
    三是政治工作中的各种工作和思想工作的关系。政治工作也有各种各样的工作，有些是事务性、行政性的工作，有些是思想性的工作。各种工作都要做，不能只做哪一个，但是重点要摆在思想工作上。共产党要把党的政策贯彻到群众中去，就是要根据群众的需要，根据活的问题去进行教育，不能抽象化。
    四是书本思想和活的思想的关系。书本也要，但重要的是活的思想，书本也要与实际相结合。部队有什么问题，中央有什么政策，国际形势如何，这是书本上没有的。要以实际为中心，用无产阶级观点、马克思列宁主义的原理来回答这些问题。思想工作要反映实际，要按实际情况去进行工作，这是唯物主义。毛主席在“改造我们的学习”、“整顿三风”、“反对党八股”的报告中都作过透彻的说明。主要是抓活的思想，摸下面的思想动态，按照中央的思想来布置工作，用马克思列宁主义的观点来回答问题。书本是要的，但进行书本教育时要联系实际。政治工作就要使上情能够下达，下情能够上达，不要梗塞。政治部的主要部门是宣传部，这是做思想工作的部。
    林彪元帅号召要像打仗一样，集中兵力，突破口子，现在就是从政治工作领域内突破思想工作这个口子，使政治工作提高一步，把工作做得好上加好。
