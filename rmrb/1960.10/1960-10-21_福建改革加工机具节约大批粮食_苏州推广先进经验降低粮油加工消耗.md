    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 20th—Fujian Province's grain processing departments have made good achievements in increasing rice yield and using rice bran to extract oil. From January to August this year, by increasing the rice yield of paddy, a total of 30 million catties of finished grain was produced for the state; from January to September, 3 million catties of oil were extracted from rice bran, nearly three times the amount in the same period last year.
    Since the beginning of this year, grain processing plants in various parts of Fujian Province have continuously launched technical innovation and technical revolution movements centered on increasing rice yield, reforming processing machinery, and promoting advanced experiences, so that the rice yield of paddy has been rising steadily. The average rice yield in the first quarter was 72.68%, 0.48% higher than last year; in the second quarter, it increased to 73.24%. More than 95% of the rice processed by the processing plants affiliated to the Fuzhou Grain Bureau this year has reached the "four separations" standard (separation of grain, bran, sand, and barnyard grass), the completeness rate of finished products has reached more than 80%, and the rice yield has also increased accordingly. In seven months, nearly one million catties of finished grain were produced for the state. During the technical innovation movement, half of the rice mills in Songzheng County realized automated and semi-automated production. The county's average rice yield increased by 1.08% compared with last year, and the cost decreased by 22.47%. Rice mills in Quanzhou City actively promoted advanced experiences such as "light machinery and multiple milling." The average rice yield in the second quarter reached 74.75%, 1.45% higher than last year.
    Grain departments in various localities actively helped rural people's communes reform grain processing machinery and improve processing technology. In Jianyang County, located in the mountainous area of northern Fujian, more than 80% of the food grain had to be processed by old-fashioned water mills and manual labor in the past. This year, with the help of the grain department, more than 200 new and rebuilt grain processing plants were built, and the abundant water resources in the mountainous area were used to realize mechanized hydropower processing, which greatly improved the rice yield. For example, after the Xiyuan Brigade of Chengguan Commune realized mechanized hydropower grain processing, every 100 catties of paddy could produce six more catties of rice.
    In the large-scale rice bran oil extraction, the Fujian Provincial Grain Department allocated 500,000 yuan to help communes and brigades build oil extraction plants and add 3,000 oil presses. In Jinjiang County, most grain processing plants have added oil extraction workshops to process rice bran and extract oil on the spot. In half a year, more than 50,000 catties of rice bran oil have been produced. Due to continuous technical innovation in operation, various localities have accumulated and created many advanced experiences in rice bran oil extraction, which has continuously increased the oil yield. The province's oil yield has increased from more than eight catties of oil per 100 catties of rice bran last year to more than ten catties.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 20th—Employees of rice milling, flour milling, and oil pressing departments in Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province, are promoting the spirit of thrift, "contending for every two cents and not letting a single grain go to waste," and striving to reduce raw material consumption and increase the yield of rice, flour, and oil in the process of processing agricultural products.
    Zhang Qidao, Deputy Director of the Suzhou Grain Bureau, went to the Third Rice Mill and, together with Ling Zhiming, the deputy director of the factory, advanced producers Cheng Yonghua, Yang Yongxing, and others, organized a three-way combination team to compare and measure each rice machine to find ways to increase the rice yield. The comparative measurements of the No. 1 rice machine and the No. 2 rice machine showed that the hourly output of the No. 2 rice machine was 30% higher than that of the No. 1 rice machine, and the rice yield per 100 catties of paddy was more than half a catty higher. They also measured the operating skills of Class A and Class B and found that the hourly output of Class B was more than 2,000 catties higher than that of Class A, and the rice yield per 100 catties of paddy was also more than four taels higher. Based on the measured data and mass discussions, the factory summarized an experience of increasing yield, output, quality, and reducing costs, that is, in the process of paddy processing, mechanical direct processing should be reduced as much as possible, and natural milling should be increased as much as possible. The Municipal Grain Bureau promoted this experience in grain factories throughout the city, and the rice yield was significantly improved.
    At the same time, all the workers in the flour milling workshop of the Suzhou Flour Mill also tried every means to increase the wheat flour yield. Sun Xiaomao, the leader of Class B, took control of the first "gate" for raw materials entering the machine, promptly discovered changes in raw materials, firmly grasped the process of cleaning wheat into the warehouse and clean wheat grinding, tightened the links from raw material cleaning to flour milling, and strengthened the patrol inspection work of the department and the close connection between departments. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the entire class, the average net wheat flour yield in the first half of September reached 86.99%, an average increase of 0.53 catties compared with August, and more than 10,000 catties of flour were produced for the country. The Suzhou Grease Chemical Factory adopted the operation method of pre-pressing and leaching to extract the residual oil from the oil cake pressed by the screw oil press, reducing the loss of rapeseed oil. In the past two months, it has increased the production of rapeseed oil by 93,000 catties for the country.

    福建改革加工机具节约大批粮食
    苏州推广先进经验降低粮油加工消耗
    新华社福州20日电　福建省粮食加工部门在提高出米率和用米糠榨油方面，做出了良好的成绩。今年1月到8月，通过提高稻谷出米率，共为国家增产成品粮三千万斤；1月至9月，用米糠榨出油三百万斤，比去年同期增长近三倍。
    今年以来，福建省各地粮食加工厂不断开展以提高出米率为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，改革加工机具，推广先进经验，使稻谷出米率节节上升，第一季度的平均出米率为72.68％，比去年提高0.48％；第二季度又提高到73.24％。福州粮食局所属加工厂今年以来加工的大米，有95％以上达到了“四断”（断谷、断糠、断砂、断稗）的标准，成品完整率达到80％以上，出米率也随之提高，七个月就为国家增产成品粮近一百万斤。松政县各碾米厂在技术革新运动中，有一半的工厂实现了自动化、半自动化生产，全县平均出米率比去年提高了1.08％，成本降低了22.47％。泉州市各碾米厂积极推广“轻机多碾”等先进经验，第二季度平均出米率达到74.75％，比去年提高了1.45％。
    各地粮食部门积极帮助农村人民公社改革粮食加工机具，改进加工技术。地处闽北山区的建阳县，过去有80％以上的口粮要靠旧式水碓和人力加工，今年在粮食部门的帮助下，新建、改建了两百多个粮食加工厂，并利用山区水力资源丰富的条件，实现水力加工机械化，大大提高了出米率。如城关公社溪源大队实现粮食加工水力机械化后，每百斤稻谷可多出大米六斤。
    在大搞米糠榨油中，福建省粮食厅拨出五十万元，帮助各公社、大队兴建榨油厂，增添了油车三千架。晋江县大部分粮食加工厂在附设榨油车间就地加工米糠就地榨油后，半年中即增产米糠油五万多斤。由于不断进行操作技术革新，各地在米糠榨油中积累和创造了不少先进经验，使出油率不断提高，全省出油率已由去年每百斤米糠出油八斤多，提高到十斤以上。
    据新华社南京20日电　江苏省苏州市碾米、磨面、榨油部门职工在加工农产品的过程中，发扬“两钱必争、颗粒不让”的节约精神，努力降低原料消耗，提高米、面、油的出率。
    苏州市粮食局副局长张启道深入到第三碾米厂，与这个厂的副厂长凌志明、先进生产者程永华、杨永兴等人组织了三结合小组，对每台米机进行对比测定，寻找提高大米出率的办法。他们对一号米机和二号米机的对比测定表明，二号米机的小时产量比一号米机高30％，每百斤稻谷出米率高半斤多。他们还测定了甲班和乙班的操作技术，发现乙班小时产量比甲班高二千多斤，每百斤稻谷的出米率也多出了四两多。根据测定的数据和群众讨论，全厂总结出了一条提高出率、产量、质量和降低成本的经验，即在稻谷加工过程中，要尽可能减少机械直接加工，尽可能增加自然碾磨。市粮食局在全市粮食工厂中推广了这个经验，出米率显著提高。
    与此同时，苏州面粉厂制粉车间乙班全体工人也千方百计地提高小麦出粉率。乙班班长孙小毛把住了原料进机的第一“关”，及时发现原料变化，狠抓清麦入仓和净麦上磨环节，从原料的清理到制粉环环扣紧，同时加强了本部门的巡回检查工作和部门与部门之间的密切联系。由于全班同心协力，9月上半月的净麦出粉率平均达到86.99％，比8月份平均提高了零点五三斤，为国家增产面粉一万多斤。苏州市油脂化学厂采取预榨浸出的操作方法，把螺旋榨油机压榨过的油饼余油提出来，降低了菜油损失，两个月来已为国家增产菜子油九万三千斤。
