Shop assistants must pay attention to service methods in order to serve the working people well. Service attitude is a major manifestation of service methods. Based on my personal experience, a good service attitude for shop assistants should be reflected in the following points:

	I. Initiative: The so-called initiative means that when a customer walks near the counter and looks at certain goods, the shop assistant should welcome the customer and greet them proactively. When necessary, the shop assistant should also take out the goods for the customer to see, and proactively introduce the performance and characteristics of the goods to the customer.

	II. Enthusiasm: That is, to have a revolutionary optimistic spirit and warm, comradely feelings. Shop assistants should not be cold and indifferent to customers, but should receive customers with a happy mood, full of emotion, and with consideration, and answer questions raised by customers.

	III. Patience: The so-called patience means having the spirit of never being annoyed by repeated questions and never being tired of repeated fetching. Whether or not a shop assistant is patient in receiving customers should be regarded as a matter of whether or not they are responsible to the customer.

	IV. Sincerity: The so-called sincerity means being loyal and earnest to customers. When introducing and explaining goods, one should adopt a serious and responsible attitude, promote the goods realistically, talk about the advantages as well as explain the weaknesses of the goods.

	V. Politeness: The so-called politeness means respecting customers. It can be manifested in many aspects, such as language, voice, movements, and posture. The language should be concise, the voice should be gentle, the attitude should be clear, and different titles must be used for different customers.

    售货员的服务态度
    赵淑琴
    要把劳动人民侍候好，就得讲究侍候方法。服务态度，是侍候方法的一种主要表现。据我个人的体会，售货员服务态度好，应表现在下面几点：
    一、主动：所谓主动，也就是说，当顾客走到柜台附近注视着某些商品的时候，售货员应对顾客表示欢迎，主动地向顾客打招呼。在必要的时候，还应该把商品拿出来给顾客看，主动向顾客介绍商品的性能和特征。
    二、热情：即要有革命乐观主义精神和亲热的同志般的感情。对顾客不应该冷冷淡淡，而应该是心情舒畅地、感情充沛地、体贴地接待顾客，回答顾客提出的问题。
    三、耐心：所谓耐心，就是要有百问不烦，百拿不厌的精神。接待顾客是否耐心应该看作是否对顾客负责的问题。
    四、诚恳：所谓诚恳，就是对待顾客要忠诚，恳切，在介绍和解释商品的时候，应抱着一个认真负责的态度，实事求是地宣传商品，既谈优点同时也应讲清商品的弱点。
    五、礼貌：所谓有礼貌，就是对顾客要尊敬。它可以表现在许多方面，如语言、声音、动作、姿态等。语言要简练，声音要温和，态度要明朗，对不同的顾客必须用不同的称号。
