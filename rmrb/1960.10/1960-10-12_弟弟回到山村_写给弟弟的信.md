Younger Brother Returns to the Mountain Village
——A Letter to My Younger Brother

Li Xue'ao
Hearing that my younger brother had returned to the mountain village, I was so happy that I didn’t sleep a wink all night. My colorful thoughts, like festive fireworks, carried joy straight into the blue sky! What a wonderful hometown! What a wonderful mountain village! Every spring, every rock, every white cloud, every clod of earth, every simple peasant… everything in my hometown is etched so deeply in my heart! Ah, what a wonderful hometown! What a wonderful mountain village! How many people have gathered in the mountain village, how many people have set out from the mountain village, how many people have bid farewell in the mountain village, how many people have reunited in the mountain village, how many people have sworn an oath to join the Party in the mountain village, how many people have participated in the revolution in the mountain village, how many heroes have grown up in the mountain village, how many heroes have dedicated their youth to the mountain village! Ah, it has been fourteen or fifteen years since I left my hometown and the people of my hometown. On the dusty roads, in the smoke-filled trenches, in the boiling workshops, and in the joyous Tiananmen Square, I often think of the glorious history of the mountain village, and even more of my own glorious responsibility: "You, must go full steam ahead!" Younger brother, how fortunate you are to respond to the great call of the Party and Chairman Mao, and you have returned to the mountain village! Study there, labor there, create new history with your fathers, and create new merits for the mountain village – let every spring water irrigate the crops! Let every white cloud turn into a flock of sheep! Let every rock turn into steel! Let every clod of earth turn into gold! Chairman Mao has given us the mountain-opening axe, and the Three Mountains and Five Peaks are at our command! Younger brother, my dear younger brother, when I am manufacturing seeders in the workshop, when I am laboring in the fields of suburban Beijing, when I unfold my daily *People's Daily*, when I listen to rural news on the radio, when I interview new heroic figures, when I conceive a new poem under the lamp! … I am eagerly awaiting your triumphant reply.

    弟弟回到山村
    ——写给弟弟的信
    李学鳌听说弟弟回到山村，喜得我一夜没有阖眼。缤纷的思绪呀，如节日的焰火，带着欢乐，直上青空！那是多好的家乡！那是多好的山村！每股泉水，每块岩石，每片白云，每块泥土，每个淳朴的农民……家乡的一切啊，在我心里，都刻得那么深！啊，多好的家乡！多好的山村！曾有多少人在山村集合，多少人从山村出征，多少人在山村告别，多少人在山村重逢，多少人在山村宣誓入党，多少人在山村参加革命，多少英雄在山村成长，多少英雄为山村献出青春！啊，十四、五年了，我离开家乡和家乡的人。在黄尘滚滚的行车路上，在硝烟弥漫的战壕中，在沸腾的车间里，在欢乐的天安门，我常常想起山村的光荣历史，更想起自己的光荣责任：“你呀，要开足最大的马力前
  进！”弟弟呀，你是多么荣幸，响应党和毛主席的伟大号召，你又重返山村！在那里学习，在那里劳动，跟着父辈创造新历史，为山村创造新功勋——叫每股泉水都滋润庄稼！叫每片白云都化作羊群！叫每块岩石都变成钢铁！叫每块泥土都变成黄金！毛主席给了我们开山斧，三山五岳听调动！弟弟呀，亲爱的弟弟，当我在车间制造播种机，当我在京郊的田野上劳动，当我展开每天的《人民日
  报》，当我在收音机前听农村新闻，当我采访新的英雄人物，当我在灯下构思一篇新的诗
  文！……我急切地等着你胜利的回音。
