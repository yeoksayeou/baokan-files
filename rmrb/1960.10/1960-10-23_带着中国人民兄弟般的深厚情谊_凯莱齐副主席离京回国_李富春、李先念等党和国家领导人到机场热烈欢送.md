Xinhua News Agency, 22nd. The Albanian China Friendship Association delegation, led by Albanian Labor Party Central Committee Member, Council of Ministers Vice Chairman, and Albanian-China Friendship Association Chairman, Abdyl Kellezi, carrying the profound brotherly friendship of the Chinese people, left Beijing by plane this afternoon to return home.

Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premiers of the State Council, and Jiang Nanxiang, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee and President of the Chinese-Albanian Friendship Association, went to the airport to see off Comrade Kellezi and the distinguished guests of the Albanian-China Friendship Association delegation.

President Jiang Nanxiang spoke at the airport. He said, we are seeing off the friendly envoys of the Albanian people – the Albanian-China Friendship Association delegation headed by Comrade Kellezi – with infinite reluctance. We once again thank the delegation for bringing the profound friendship of the heroic Albanian people to the Chinese people. At the same time, please convey the most sincere friendship and respect of the Chinese people to the fraternal Albanian people.

Jiang Nanxiang said that the Chinese people hold boundless love and respect for the glorious Albanian Labor Party and the people of Albania, headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha. The friendly visit of the Albanian-China Friendship Association delegation has further developed the friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people and strengthened the unity of the two peoples. This profound friendship and solid unity demonstrates the invincible power of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. We are all honored and proud of this ever-growing and sublime friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people.

Jiang Nanxiang finally emphasized that the 650 million Chinese people will always be the loyal brothers of the Albanian people. In the cause of socialist construction, in the struggle against imperialism, in the struggle against modern revisionism represented by Yugoslavia, and in the struggle to defend world peace, the Chinese people will always stand with you and fight to the end for the final victory of our common cause.

Head of Delegation Kellezi said at the airport: "We are about to return to our country with the best impressions. We are filled with pride to have such strong friends as the brotherly Chinese people and the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the loyal son of the Chinese people."

Kellezi said: "During our stay in your country, no matter where we went or whom we met, we were received with extreme cordiality. We have once again experienced how strong the love of the Chinese people for the Albanian people is, and how deep the friendship between our two peoples is, forged by the Marxist-Leninist parties of our two countries. We will convey this deep affection and friendship to the Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party." "We regard the cordial and brotherly reception you have given us as an expression of the love of your 650 million Chinese people for the Albanian people, the Labor Party, and our dear leaders headed by Comrade Hoxha."

Kellezi said: "We have seen the tremendous achievements made by your people and Party in a short period of time, and we are greatly pleased by this. These tremendous achievements show that the line of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong has been and is correct. It is a Marxist-Leninist line creatively implemented by the Party. Your great achievements cannot be erased. These achievements shine on all of China, and they are the achievements of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the achievements of all progressive forces in the world."

Kellezi emphasized: "We regard your achievements as our own achievements, and we are proud that our Chinese comrades and the Chinese people are advancing at an astonishing speed. We are proud that the new China has a party like yours, which teaches the people to hate imperialism, to love all revolutionary movements and colonial liberation movements with internationalist feelings, and to hate the main danger in the communist and workers' movement – modern revisionism and Yugoslav revisionism. We are proud of the correct struggle waged by our two parties to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism."

Kellezi finally said: "At this moment when we are about to leave China and return home, we extend our best wishes to the heroic, hardworking, and talented brotherly Chinese people, and wish them even greater achievements. May the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples, based on the invincible Marxist-Leninist ideology, continue to be strengthened and bear fruit."

The speeches of Jiang Nanxiang and Kellezi were interrupted by bursts of warm applause from the audience. The well-wishers waved colored flags and flowers, and repeatedly shouted: "Long live the friendship between China and Albania!" "Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!"

Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, President Jiang Nanxiang and others went to the plane to bid farewell to Comrade Kellezi and the comrades of the delegation. The distinguished guests reluctantly embraced the well-wishers, shook hands cordially to say goodbye, and accepted flowers from the capital's young women.

Among those who came to the airport to see them off were Yang Xiufeng and Zeng Shan, members of the CPC Central Committee, Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Luo Guibo, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang Shusheng, Vice Minister of National Defense, responsible persons of various departments of the state government organs, people's organizations, and Beijing Municipality, as well as hundreds of people from all walks of life in the capital.

    带着中国人民兄弟般的深厚情谊
    凯莱齐副主席离京回国
    李富春、李先念等党和国家领导人到机场热烈欢送
    新华社22日讯　由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、部长会议副主席、阿中友好协会主席阿卜杜勒·凯莱齐率领的阿尔巴尼亚中国友好协会代表团，带着中国人民兄弟般的深厚情谊，今天下午乘飞机离北京回国。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李富春、李先念，中共中央候补委员、中国阿尔巴尼亚友好协会会长蒋南翔到机场欢送凯莱齐同志和阿中友协代表团的贵宾们。
    蒋南翔会长在机场上讲话。他说，我们怀着无限惜别的心情欢送阿尔巴尼亚人民的友好使者——以凯莱齐同志为首的阿中友协代表团。我们再一次感谢代表团给中国人民带来了英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的深厚友情。同时，也请你们把中国人民最诚挚的友情和敬意带给兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民。
    蒋南翔说，中国人民对于以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚的人民，怀着无比的热爱和尊敬。阿中友协代表团的友好访问，进一步发展了中阿两国人民之间的友谊，加强了两国人民的团结。这种深厚的友谊和坚固的团结，显示了马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的不可战胜的力量。我们都以中阿两国人民之间这种日益增长的崇高的友谊而感到光荣和自豪。
    蒋南翔最后强调说，六亿五千万中国人民永远是阿尔巴尼亚人民的忠实兄弟。在社会主义的建设事业中，在反对帝国主义的斗争中，在反对以南斯拉夫为代表的现代修正主义的斗争中，在保卫世界和平的斗争中，中国人民将永远和你们站在一起，为争取我们共同事业的最后胜利而奋斗到底。
    凯莱齐团长在机场上讲话说：“我们怀着最好的印象即将返回自己的祖国，我们为有着像兄弟的中国人民和以中国人民的忠实儿子毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党这样强大的朋友而充满自豪。”
    凯莱齐说：“我们在你们国家停留期间，不论我们到那里，不论会见什么人，我们都受到了极其亲切的接待。我们再一次地体会到：中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民的热爱是多么强烈，经我们两国马克思列宁主义的党铸炼成的我们两国人民的友谊是多么深厚。我们将把这种热爱和友好的深厚情谊，转达给阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党。”“我们把你们给予我们亲切的兄弟般的接待，看做是你们六亿五千万中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民、劳动党和我们以霍查同志为首的亲爱的领导人所表达的热爱。”
    凯莱齐说：“我们看到了你们的人民和党在一个短暂的时期内所取得的巨大成就，并为此而感到莫大的高兴。这些巨大的成就说明，以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的路线过去和现在都是正确的，它是一条马克思列宁主义的、由党创造性地贯彻着的路线。你们的巨大成就不容抹煞。这些成就照耀着全中国，它们是以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的成就，是世界全体进步力量的成就。”
    凯莱齐着重说：“我们把你们的成就看成是我们自己的成就，并为我们的中国同志、中国人民以惊人的速度在前进而感到自豪。我们自豪的是：新中国有一个像你们这样的党，它教导人民憎恨帝国主义，以国际主义感情热爱一切革命运动和殖民地解放运动，憎恨共产主义和工人运动中的主要危险——现代修正主义和南斯拉夫修正主义。我们为我们两党为捍卫马克思列宁主义纯洁性而进行的正确斗争引为骄傲。”
    凯莱齐最后说：“在这即将离开中国回国的时刻，我们向英勇、勤劳和天才的兄弟中国人民致以最良好的祝愿，祝他们取得更大的成就。祝阿中两国人民间的无往不胜的马克思列宁主义思想为基础的牢不可破的友谊不断加强和开花结果。”
    蒋南翔和凯莱齐的讲话被全场一阵又一阵的热烈掌声所打断。欢送的人群挥动着彩旗和鲜花，不断高呼：“中阿友谊万岁！”“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大团结万岁！”
  李富春、李先念副总理和蒋南翔会长等到飞机前送别凯莱齐同志和代表团的同志们。贵宾们依依不舍地同欢送的人们拥抱、亲切地握手告别，并接受了首都女青年的献花。
    到机场欢送的，还有中共中央委员杨秀峰、曾山，对外文化联络委员会主任张奚若，外交部副部长罗贵波，国防部副部长王树声，国家政府机关各部门、各人民团体和北京市负责人，以及首都各界群众数百人。
