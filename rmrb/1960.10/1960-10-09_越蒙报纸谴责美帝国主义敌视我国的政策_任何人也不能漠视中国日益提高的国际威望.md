Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Vietnamese newspaper "People's Daily" and Mongolian newspaper "Labor News" published editorials and commentaries respectively, criticizing U.S. imperialism and its lackeys for obstructing the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

    The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 4th, stating that the People's Republic of China has been established for eleven years. With its great achievements in building a prosperous and strong country, and its enormous contributions to safeguarding world peace and supporting the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the international prestige of the People's Republic of China is increasing day by day. However, due to the destructive activities of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, the great People's Republic of China has still not been able to restore its legitimate seat in the United Nations. This is extremely unreasonable.

    The editorial stated that, as emphasized by international progressive public opinion, the United Nations cannot fulfill its responsibilities without the participation of the peace-loving and powerful socialist country with the largest population in the world—the People's Republic of China.

    The editorial said that the imperialist bloc headed by U.S. imperialism blatantly and openly opposes the wishes of the people of all countries in the world who urgently demand the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, and stubbornly clings to the corpse of Chiang Kai-shek to prevent the People's Republic of China from participating in the United Nations. Their actions once again expose their reactionary conspiracy, which is to attempt to use the United Nations as a tool for the imperialist bloc's challenges and aggression.

    The editorial stated that the people of the world strongly oppose the U.S. and the imperialist bloc's continued obstruction of China's accession to the United Nations through conspiracies and actions. The struggle of the people of the world to support China's entry into the United Nations is rising in various places. At present, U.S. imperialism continues to exert pressure on the countries it controls, preventing the issue of China's entry into the United Nations from being resolved. However, U.S. imperialism cannot stop the wheel of history from moving forward, and it cannot erase the distinct fact that a great country—the People's Republic of China—exists on this earth.

    The editorial stated that the Vietnamese people, together with the people of the world, actively support the Soviet Union's proposal regarding the People's Republic of China's entry into the United Nations.

    The Mongolian "Labor News" published a commentary on the 5th, stating that the international relations of the People's Republic of China are being further consolidated, and trade and cultural relations have spread throughout the world. The Chinese people, who are working hard to build their economically backward motherland into an industrially developed socialist country, are waging unremitting struggles for peace and friendship.

    The commentary pointed out that the fundamental reason why this great country has not yet been admitted to the United Nations lies in the criminal activities of U.S. imperialism.

    The commentary said that the stubborn and barbaric U.S. ruling clique launched an armed aggression against China in 1950, occupied China's Taiwan, and turned it into its own military base. They expanded and added military bases directly targeting the People's Republic of China, and frequently carried out provocative and subversive activities. The commentary also said that the Mongolian working class and the public resolutely condemn the shameful behavior of the United States and its lackeys.

    The commentary concluded: "The United States is also obstructing the Mongolian People's Republic from joining the United Nations. The Mongolian people firmly believe that its policy of attempting to exclude all just countries, large and small, will soon end in bankruptcy."

### 越蒙报纸谴责美帝国主义敌视我国的政策  任何人也不能漠视中国日益提高的国际威望

    越蒙报纸谴责美帝国主义敌视我国的政策
    任何人也不能漠视中国日益提高的国际威望
    新华社8日讯　越南“人民报”和蒙古“劳动报”分别发表社论和评论，抨击美帝国主义及其仆从阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位。
    越南“人民报”4日发表社论说，中华人民共和国诞生已经十一周年了。以建设富强国家的伟大成就和保卫世界和平和支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲民族解放运动的巨大贡献，中华人民共和国的国际威望日益提高。但是，由于美帝国主义及其走狗的破坏活动，至今，伟大的中华人民共和国仍然没有能恢复在联合国的合法席位。这是极其无理的。
    社论说，正如国际进步舆论所强调指出的，如果没有爱好和平的、占世界人口最多的强大的社会主义国家——中华人民共和国的参加，联合国就不可能完成它的职责。
    社论说，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团明目张胆地公开反对迫切要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国合法席位的世界各国人民的愿望，死心塌地地抱着蒋介石这具僵尸来阻止中华人民共和国参加联合国。他们的这种行动再一次揭穿了自己的反动阴谋，这个阴谋就是企图利用联合国来作为帝国主义集团挑战和侵略的工具。
    社论说，全世界人民极力反对美国和帝国主义集团继续阻挠中国加入联合国的阴谋和行动。世界人民支持中国进入联合国的斗争在各地日益高涨。目前，美帝国主义依然对它所控制的各国施加压力，使中国进入联合国的问题不能得到解决。但是，美帝国主义阻挡不了历史的车轮前进，它抹杀不了在地球上存在的一个伟大国家——中华人民共和国——这个鲜明的事实。
    社论说，越南人民同世界人民一起，积极支持苏联关于中华人民共和国进入联合国的建议。
    蒙古“劳动报”5日发表评论说，中华人民共和国的国际关系正在进一步巩固，贸易和文化关系已经普及全世界。为把经济上落后的祖国建设成为工业发达的社会主义国家而努力的中国人民，在为争取和平与友谊进行着坚持不懈斗争。
    评论指出，现在还没有接纳这个伟大的国家进入联合国的根本原因在于美帝国主义的罪恶活动。
    评论说，顽固野蛮的美国统治集团1950年向中国发动武装侵略，侵占中国的台湾，把它变成自己的军事基地。它们扩大和增设直接针对中华人民共和国的军事基地，经常进行挑衅颠覆活动。评论又说，蒙古工人阶级和公众坚决斥责美国及其仆从的可耻行为。
    评论最后说：“美国也阻挠蒙古人民共和国加入联合国。蒙古人民坚信，不久它那种企图排斥一切大小正义国家的政策必将以破产告终”。
