Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou Electric Dispatch. The Mine Plant of Anyang Iron and Steel Company in Henan Province, carrying forward the spirit of continuous revolution, has innovated, coordinated, and re-innovated its production technology, thus pushing mine production to new levels with each wave higher than the last. Currently, this mine plant has eliminated heavy manual labor and achieved automatic and semi-automatic mine car round trips, chute-based loading platform, mechanized and semi-mechanized rock drilling, and large-scale blasting. The ore production in the first half of this year has increased by more than 42% compared to the entire year of last year.

This plant was born in the mass steelmaking movement of 1958. The workers initially used only some backward tools such as hammers, chisels, carrying poles, and baskets, resulting in high labor intensity and low production efficiency, which did not meet the needs of the company's continuously increasing blast furnaces and steadily increasing output. At that time, there were two opposing views in the factory: one advocated adhering to putting politics in command, vigorously carrying out mass movements for technical innovation and revolution to change the backward state of mine production; the other advocated waiting for equipment and increasing workers. To this end, the factory Party committee organized all employees to conduct a debate on the two roads of mine production; at the same time, it issued a call to the employees to "eliminate the phenomenon of shoulder carrying and manual lifting within seven days." After debate, the employees rejected the latter view and took active action, eliminating shoulder carrying and manual lifting in just three days. This fact greatly inspired and encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers, thus rapidly setting off a vigorous upsurge of technical innovation and revolution throughout the factory.

The technical innovation and revolution of Anyang Iron and Steel Company's Mine Plant were carried out around the four major aspects of rock drilling, blasting, transportation, and loading. They adopted the method of concentrating superior forces and organizing battles in batches, continuously breaking through the old production system, so that the four major aspects were re-coordinated on a new technical basis to form a new production system. After innovation - coordination - re-innovation, in less than two years, the main aspects of rock drilling, blasting, and transportation in this plant have developed from manual hammer drilling, small-scale blasting, and shoulder carrying to manual or foot-operated mechanical rock drilling, medium-sized blasting, and vehicle-based and rail-based transportation; subsequently, it has developed to electric mechanical rock drilling, a combination of large, medium, and small-scale blasting, and automatic and semi-automatic transportation.

In the process of innovation - coordination - re-innovation, Anyang Iron and Steel Company's Mine Plant adhered to the principle of active balance based on the spirit of continuous revolution. When rock drilling developed from manual hammer to semi-mechanization and blasting developed from small-scale blasting to medium-sized blasting, the method of transporting with small flat cars pushed by people was no longer suitable, and there was a phenomenon of ore waiting to be loaded and transported. In the face of this new imbalance, the factory Party committee and the masses of workers conscientiously implemented the principle of active balance. After a short period of struggle, they created iron and wooden mine cars and laid more than 5,000 meters of iron and wooden light rails, realizing rail-based transportation, so that transportation was re-coordinated with rock drilling and blasting, and a new balance relationship was established. After the establishment of the new balance, the factory Party committee once again directed the spearhead of technical revolution to rock drilling and blasting. Such cycles continued endlessly, enabling production to develop continuously.

The technical innovation and revolution movement of this factory has also consistently implemented the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and self-reliance. In the process of realizing rail-based transportation, the workers in the Dongye mining area collected a large amount of wood and scrap iron, and cast more than 300 meters of pig iron rails. After realizing rail-based transportation, the workers took advantage of the natural terrain to transform the rails into sloping shapes. A total of 49 automatic and semi-automatic sliding transportation lines were laid throughout the factory, and a climbing machine that allows mine cars to automatically climb to the top of the slope was also manufactured, enabling the main mining points to realize automatic round-trip car operation, greatly improving production efficiency.

Currently, a new high tide of technical innovation and revolution centered on the comprehensive coordination of stripping, mining, beneficiation, crushing, and transportation is vigorously unfolding in Anyang Iron and Steel Company's Mine Plant. All employees are full of confidence in further improving the level of production technology. (Attached picture)

    技术革新不断巩固不断提高
    安阳钢铁公司矿山厂消灭笨重体力劳动矿石产量大增
    新华社郑州电　河南省安阳钢铁公司矿山厂发扬不断革命的精神，在生产技术上革新——配套——再革新，从而一浪高过一浪地将矿山生产推向新的水平。目前，这个矿山厂已经消灭了笨重的体力劳动，实现了矿车往返自动化和半自动化，装车平台溜斗化，凿岩机械化和半机械化，爆破大炮化。今年上半年的矿石产量就已比去年全年的产量增加了42％以上。
    这个厂是1958年在全民大炼钢铁运动中诞生的。工人们最初使用的只是一些锤、钎、担、筐等落后工具，劳动强度大，生产效率低，不适应公司高炉陆续增加、产量不断跃进的形势。当时厂里有两种针锋相对的意见：一是主张坚持政治挂帅，大搞技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，改变矿山生产的落后状态；一是主张坐等设备，增加工人。为此，工厂党委组织全厂职工开展了矿山生产两条道路的鸣放辩论；同时，向职工们发出“七天内消灭肩担人抬现象”的号召。职工们经过鸣放辩论否定了后一种主张，而且积极行动起来，只用三天时间，便消灭了肩担、人抬。这一事实大大激发和鼓舞了工人群众的革命干劲，从而在全厂范围内迅速掀起了一个热气腾腾的技术革新和技术革命高潮。
    安阳钢铁公司矿山厂的技术革新和技术革命，是围绕凿岩、爆破、运输、装车四大环节进行的。他们采取集中优势兵力，分批组织战役的作法，不断突破旧有的生产体系，使四大环节在新的技术基础上重新配起套来，形成新的生产体系。经过革新——配套——再革新，在不足两年的时间里，这个厂的凿岩、爆破、运输等主要环节，就由人工抡锤凿岩、小型爆破、肩担人抬，发展到手摇或脚踏机械凿岩、中型爆破、运输车子化和轨道化；继而，又发展到电动机械凿岩、大中小爆破相结合、运输自动化半自动化。
    在革新——配套——再革新的过程中，安阳钢铁公司矿山厂根据不断革命的精神，坚持了积极平衡的方针。当凿岩由人工抡锤发展为半机械化、爆破由小型爆破发展为中型爆破以后，人推小平车的运输方法与此不相适应，出现了矿石待装待运的现象。在这种新的不平衡面前，厂党委和职工群众认真执行了积极平衡的方针，经过短时期奋斗，创造了铁、木质矿车，铺设了铁、木质轻便轨道五千余米，实现了运输轨道化，使得运输跟凿岩、爆破重新配起套来，建立了新的平衡关系。新的平衡建立以后，厂党委又将技术革命的矛头重新指向凿岩和爆破。如此循环不已，使生产持续向前发展。
    这个厂的技术革新和技术革命运动，还自始至终贯彻了土洋并举、自力更生的方针。在实现运输轨道化的过程中，东冶矿区的工人搜集了大量的木材和碎铁，铸成生铁轨道三百多米。实现轨道化以后，工人们又借自然地势，将轨道改造为斜坡形，全厂共铺设了四十九条自动化和半自动化的滑形运输线，还制成了可让矿车自动爬上坡顶的爬坡机，使主要矿点实现了往返自动跑车，大大提高了生产效率。
    目前，一个以剥、采、选、破、运全面配套为中心的技术革新和技术革命新高潮，又在安阳钢铁公司矿山厂蓬勃展开，全厂职工满怀信心地在进一步提高生产技术水平。（附图片）
