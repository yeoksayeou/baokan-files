Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 14th: Hubei province is actively carrying out a meticulous harvesting and threshing campaign during the autumn harvest. Currently, approximately two million laborers across the province have been concentrated on the autumn harvesting front. By the 6th, over 12 million mu of various autumn grain crops had been harvested.

This year, the area of autumn grain crops in Hubei province is larger than last year. Following the completion of the mid-season rice harvest, over 18 million mu of single-season late japonica rice, deep-water rice, double-cropping rice, *yangsun*, sweet potatoes, sorghum, beans, and other grain crops have successively ripened. The characteristics of these crops are: wide distribution, many varieties, and different ripening periods. Based on past experience, if the work is not tightly grasped, it is easy to have rough harvesting and threshing, and scattering and waste. If it is grasped well, each mu can yield several, or even dozens, of more *jin* of grain. Recently, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call, requiring all localities to grasp the autumn harvest to the end, and strive for more autumn grain. In accordance with this spirit, cadres and commune members in various localities have organized the summation of past experiences and lessons from the autumn harvest, criticized the idea of emphasizing rice and neglecting dry-land crops, grasping the large pieces of land and neglecting the corners, and emphasizing staple grains and neglecting miscellaneous grains. At the same time, forces have been organized to go deep into the fields to conduct a comprehensive survey and classification of the distribution and ripening periods of autumn harvest crops, distinguishing between early and late, and rationally arranging harvesting labor and time, so as to harvest as soon as crops are ripe, without losing a single piece.

During the autumn harvest, various localities have put forward precise requirements for the timing of harvesting and the processes of cutting, binding, transporting, stacking, threshing, and storing, according to the characteristics of different crops. For example, in the plains and lake areas, based on the characteristics of deep-water rice being prone to shattering and lodging, on the one hand, accurate mastery of the ripening period is required. On the other hand, the operating procedures of "three lights" (light cutting, light lifting, light placing), "two neats" (neat ears of grain, neat bundles), "three no drops" (no dropping ears, no dropping pods, no dropping grains), and "two changes" (changing shoulder carrying to vehicle and boat transportation, changing stacking to harvesting, transporting, and threshing as you go) have been put forward. After the Jingzhou Special District implemented the above measures, the more than one million mu of deep-water rice that is being harvested throughout the district basically meets the requirements of meticulous harvesting and threshing. In addition, harvesting times and methods have also been set for miscellaneous grains and bean crops according to different characteristics. For example, crops such as sorghum, soybeans, and corn are not easy to crack and shatter, so they are harvested during the day; broad beans and mung beans are easy to crack, so they are picked early in the morning when there is dew or after rain to avoid scattering. In order to meet the requirements of meticulous harvesting and threshing, various localities have organized labor into various specialized groups according to processes such as cutting, transporting, threshing, and storing, and implemented a responsibility system with fixed leaders, fixed labor, fixed area, fixed time, fixed work points, and fixed rewards and punishments, rationally formulating labor quotas and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses for meticulous harvesting and threshing.

Recently, the Hubei Provincial Committee has dispatched more than 7,000 cadres from provincial government departments to various parts of the province to carry out a major inspection of "Three Autumns" work, which is a great promotion for meticulous harvesting and threshing.

Xinhua News Agency News: Pastoral and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are harvesting crops on grain and feed bases, striving to ensure that every grain is brought into the granary and every blade of grass is stacked. Most of the crops in the grain and feed bases on the grasslands of Xilin Gol, Ulanqab, Ordos, Bayannur and other areas with earlier seasons have been basically harvested and transported to the fields.

Secretaries of league, banner, and commune party committees and a large number of cadres have taken up their sickles and gone into battle, participating in and leading the autumn harvest. All walks of life have also actively supported the effort with manpower and materials. Thousands of cadres, workers, students, and residents from Xilinhot City who went to West Ujimqin, East Ujimqin, and other pastoral areas to support the autumn harvest brought their own tents, pots, stoves, and tools, and shared weal and woe with the herdsmen. During the tense period of the autumn harvest, in order to solve the difficulties of insufficient labor and technology in pastoral areas, agricultural areas adjacent to pastoral areas have selected and sent a large number of experienced old farmers to assist pastoral areas in the rush harvest. The agricultural areas of Ushin, Otog, and Hanggin banners in the Ikh Ju League have a 4,500-member Han Chinese farmer shock brigade to assist the production teams of the pastoral people's communes in the rush harvest, greatly accelerating the harvesting progress.

This year, the pastoral and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of the Autonomous Region are, in the spirit of vigorously developing agriculture and grain, striving to gradually achieve self-sufficiency in the grain and feed needed by pastoral areas, and ensuring that livestock production develops more stably and at a high speed. The sown area of grain and feed bases throughout the region has expanded by nearly two times compared with last year. In addition to sowing a small amount of forage grass, two-thirds of the bases have been sown with various grains, concentrated feed crops, and vegetables. Cadres and commune members in pastoral areas have accumulated experience in managing grain and feed bases over the past few years, and continue to, with the help of Han Chinese farmers, gradually implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, changing extensive farming methods, so that the level of field management this year has been greatly improved, and various crops generally grow better than last year. The pastoral area of the Xilin Gol League has now been able to achieve self-sufficiency in the grain and feed it needs this year.

Xinhua News Agency News: While harvesting as soon as crops are ripe and meticulously harvesting and threshing, the broad masses of commune members in Shaanxi Province continue to adhere to the principle of "harvesting does not begin, processing does not stop" for late autumn crops, and vigorously grasp the late-stage management of late autumn crops, so that grain kernels gain weight, cotton grows well, and strive to harvest more in autumn.

At present, early autumn crops have been harvested in various parts of Shaanxi Province. Late corn and other autumn grain crops in Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi are still in the process of grouting; tubers are growing potato blocks, most of the autumn bolls of cotton in watered fields have not yet matured, and autumn vegetables are still in the seedling stage. In light of this situation, all localities have generally classified and ranked autumn fields according to their maturity period, and continue to strengthen late-stage management. Under the leadership of the commune party committee, each production team in the Tiaozhou Commune of Weinan County has generally ranked the autumn fields, and has taken specific processing measures according to the growth needs of various crops. In addition to harvesting the 200-plus mu of corn that had matured, the Baijiahe Production Team conducted another cultivation, weeding, and topping to promote early maturity for the 420 mu that could be harvested before the frost; for the 700 mu that could only be harvested after the frost, they added another topdressing while cultivating and weeding, to promote grain weight gain. The Fenglu Production Team of the Danfeng Commune of Shang County, seized the time when sweet potatoes were at the height of their growth, irrigated soup fertilizer from the cracks in the topsoil on the potato blocks. For those without cracks, they dug a 2-3 inch deep ring trench around the potato nest to apply fertilizer along the trench, or used wooden sticks to pierce holes around the potato nest to irrigate fertilizer. Because the potato blocks increased in size and the topsoil cracked, or because of rain erosion, the potato blocks were exposed, and the soil was immediately cultivated; those whose potato blocks were not exposed were shallowly hoed. Some low-lying areas have also dug ditches around the sweet potato fields to prevent flooding.

While vigorously grasping the late-stage management of late autumn crops, a method of picking flowers and managing the land simultaneously has been adopted for more than 2 million mu of cotton in watered fields throughout the province, with old leaves being removed, stalks being pushed and ridges being merged, to promote early boll opening and improve the quality of cotton. The Xiguan Production Team of the Chengguan Commune in Sanyuan County transferred 40% of the team's labor force, and in conjunction with picking flowers, in addition to picking old leaves from more than 200 mu of cotton that was tall and shaded, they pushed stalks and merged ridges for more than 1,000 mu of cotton, which achieved significant results. According to the results of an inspection conducted here on October 7th by personnel from the Provincial Cotton Science Research Institute, the percentage of bolls opened in cotton that had undergone stalk pushing and ridge merging was 31%, while the percentage of bolls opened in cotton that had not undergone stalk pushing and ridge merging was only 9%. At the same time, the quality of the cotton picked after stalk pushing and ridge merging was generally one or two grades higher than that of cotton that had not undergone stalk pushing and ridge merging.

Judging from the weather and the growth of late autumn crops in Shaanxi Province, strengthening the late-stage management of late autumn crops can greatly increase production. For example, the results of a comparative test conducted last year by the Goujia Village Production Team of the Chengguan Commune in Shang County on the same sweet potato field showed that each mu that received an additional application of human manure in the later stage of sweet potato growth produced 410 jin more sweet potatoes than those without topdressing.

    秋收狠抓到底　秋粮多多益善
    湖北集中劳力开展细收细打运动　内蒙古收获粮食饲料基地上的作物
    陕西坚持“收割不开始加工不停止”促秋早熟力争多收
    本报武汉14日电　湖北各地在秋收中，积极开展细收细打运动。目前，全省集中到抢收战线上的劳动力达二百万人左右，到6日止，已收回各种秋粮作物一千二百多万亩。
    今年湖北省秋粮作物面积比去年大。继中稻收割任务完成以后，全省一千八百多万亩一季晚粳、深水稻、二季稻、秧荪、红苕、高粱、豆类等粮食作物也相继成熟。这些作物的特点是：分布广，品种多，成熟期不一。根据以往经验，如果抓得不紧，很容易产生粗收粗打，抛撒浪费，如果抓得好，每亩就能多收几斤以至几十斤粮食。最近，中共湖北省委发出号召，要求各地把秋收抓到底，争取秋粮多多益善。根据这一精神，各地组织干部、社员通过总结以往秋收中的经验教训，批判了重水稻轻旱作物，抓住整片大块，忽视田头地角，重视主粮忽视杂粮的思想。同时，还组织力量深入田间，对秋收作物的分布和成熟期进行了全面摸底排队，分出先后，合理安排收割劳力和时间，作到随熟随收，一块不丢。
    在秋收中，各地根据不同作物的特性，对收割的火候和割、捆、运、堆、打、藏等工序都提出了精细的要求。如平原湖区根据深水稻易脱粒易倒伏的特点，一方面要求准确掌握成熟期，另一方面对收割的方法提出了“三轻”（轻割、轻提、轻放），“两齐”（谷穗撩齐、把子放齐）、“三不掉”（不掉穗、不掉兜、不掉粒）、“两改”（改肩挑为车船运输、改堆垛为随割随运随打）的操作规程。荆州专区推行上述措施后，全区正在收割的一百多万亩深水稻，基本上符合细收细打要求。此外，对杂粮和豆类作物也根据不同特点，订出了收割时间和收割方法。如高粱、黄豆、苞谷等作物，不易炸壳脱粒，就采取白天收割；饭豆、绿豆易炸壳，就利用早晨有露水或雨后抢摘，以避免抛撒。为了适应细收细打要求，各地按割、运、打、藏等工序，将劳动力组成各种专业组，实行定领导、定劳力、定面积、定时间、定工分、定奖惩的责任制，合理制定劳动定额，调动群众细收细打的积极性。
    最近湖北省委从省直机关抽出七千多名干部，分赴全省各地开展“三秋”工作大检查，对细收细打是一个很大的促进。
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区牧区和半农半牧区正在收获粮食、饲料基地上的作物，力争颗粒归仓，寸草入垛。季节较早的锡林郭勒、乌兰察布、鄂尔多斯、巴彦淖尔等草原上的大部分粮食、饲料基地的农作物，都已基本收割完毕，拉运上场。
    盟、族、公社的党委书记和大批干部都挥镰上阵，参加秋收、领导秋收。各行各业也纷纷以人力、物力大力支援。锡林浩特市去西乌珠穆沁、东乌珠穆沁等牧区支援秋收的几千名干部、工人、学生、居民都自带帐篷、锅灶、工具，和牧民们同甘共苦。在秋收紧张时，为了解决牧区劳力和技术不足的困难，邻近牧区的农业区都选派大批经验丰富的老农协助牧区抢收。伊克昭盟乌审、鄂托克、杭锦三个旗农业区有四千五百多汉族农民组成秋收突击队，到牧区人民公社协助各生产队抢收，大大加快了收割进度。
    自治区牧区和半农半牧区今年本着大办农业、大办粮食的精神，争取牧区需要的粮食和饲料逐步达到自给自足，保证畜牧业生产更加稳定地高速度地发展。全区粮食、饲料基地播种面积比去年扩大将近两倍，除播种少部分饲草外，三分之二的基地都播种了各种粮食、精饲料作物和蔬菜。牧区干部和社员们积累过去几年来经营管理粮食、饲料基地的经验，并继续在汉族农民的帮助下，逐步贯彻农业“八字宪法”，改变了粗放的耕作方法，使今年田间管理水平大大提高，各种作物一般都比去年长得好。锡林郭勒盟牧区今年所需要的粮食饲料已能达到自给自足。
    据新华社讯　陕西省广大社员在随熟随收、细收细打的同时，对晚秋作物继续坚持“收割不开始，加工不停止”，大抓晚秋作物的后期管理，使粮食颗粒增重，棉花长好，力争秋季多收。
    目前，陕西省各地的早秋作物已经收获。关中、陕南晚玉米等秋粮作物还在升浆；薯类正在长薯块，水地棉花的大部分秋桃尚未成熟，秋菜还在苗期。根据这种情况，各地普遍按照秋田的成熟期分类排队，继续加强后期管理。渭南县苕州公社各生产队在公社党委的领导下，普遍对秋田进行了排队，并按照各类作物的生长需要，采取了具体的加工措施。白家河生产队一千三百多亩玉米，除对已经成熟的二百多亩收割外，对霜降前可以收割的四百二十亩，又进行了一次中耕、锄草、削顶花，促使早熟；对霜降后才能收割的七百亩，在进行中耕、锄草的同时，还增施了一次追肥，促进籽粒增重。商县丹风公社风麓生产队，抓住红薯正处在生长旺盛的时候，从薯块上的表土裂缝灌汤肥，没有裂缝的在薯窝周围挖二至三寸深的环沟顺沟施肥，或用木棍在薯窝周围扎窟窿灌肥。因薯块增大，表土裂缝，或因雨水冲刷，使薯块外露的，立即进行培土，薯块未外露的进行浅锄。有些低洼地区，还在薯田周围挖了顺水沟，防止雨涝。
    在大抓晚秋作物后期管理的同时，对全省二百多万亩水地棉花，采取边拾花，边管理的办法，进行打老叶，推株并垅，促其早吐絮，提高棉花质量。三原县城关公社西关生产队，抽调全队40％的劳力，结合拾花，除对长得高大阴蔽较大的二百多亩棉花摘了老叶外，并对一千多亩棉花进行了推株并垅，收到了显著的效果。根据省棉花科学研究所10月7日派人在这里检查结果证明：经过推株并垅的棉花，吐絮的占到31％，而没有推株并垅的吐絮仅占9％。同时，在进行推株并垅后拾的棉花的质量，一般都比未进行推株并垅的提高一、二级。
    根据陕西省的天气和晚秋作物的生长情况看，加强晚秋作物的后期管理，对增加产量，大有可为。如商县城关公社苟家村生产队，去年在同一块红薯地内对比试验的结果，在红薯生长后期，每亩多施一次人粪尿，比未追肥的多产四百一十斤红薯。（附图片）
