Xinhua News Agency, October 18th, Washington Dispatch: U.S. State Department officials announced on the 17th that the U.S. government has ordered the resumption of military "aid" to Laos, including using this "aid" to pay the salaries of the Royal Lao Army.

When the Phouma government and the Lao Patriotic Front began negotiations, the U.S. government, in order to threaten the Royal Lao government to abandon its policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony, had stopped this "aid" for more than ten days. However, this pressure from the United States did not force the negotiations to stop. U.S. officials revealed that the U.S. government is currently changing its decision in an attempt to continue to exert influence and strive to ensure that "the Lao authorities make concerted efforts" to "oppose Communist pressure."

The U.S. currently provides Laos with approximately $46 million in military "aid" annually.

    企图继续对老挝内政施加压力
    美宣布恢复给老挝军事“援助”
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院官员17日宣布，美国政府已下令恢复给予老挝的军事“援助”，包括用这些“援助”来支付老挝王国军队的军饷。
    当富马政府和老挝爱国战线党开始谈判的时候，美国政府为了威胁老挝王国政府放弃和平中立和民族和睦的政策，曾经把这种“援助”停止了十多天。但是，美国的这种压力并没有能够迫使谈判停开。美国官员透露，美国政府目前所以改变决定，是企图继续施加影响，努力使“老挝当局作出一致的努力”，“反对共产党压力”。
    美国目前给予老挝的军事“援助”一年约为四千六百万美元。
