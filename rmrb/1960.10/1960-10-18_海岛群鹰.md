Island Eagles

Early morning, thick clouds filled the sky, and the sea crashed against the shore. The motorized junk we were on cast off its moorings and set sail. I couldn't help but stand on the high bow of the ship, turning back to gaze at the gradually receding Ant Island, not blinking, fearing it would suddenly disappear from view.

Having stayed for only three days, I didn't expect to feel so reluctant to leave. I couldn't help but ask myself: What on the island has captured my heart?

Perhaps it's the ruins of the Zhou family fishermen who discovered the island three hundred years ago, and those enchanting legends? Perhaps it's the beautiful scenery of the peaks and shallow depressions? The islanders' soaring spirit and the atmosphere of diligence, thrift, and community spirit truly inspire admiration. And when standing on the newly built sea wall, watching teams of fishing boats setting sail in the morning glow and returning fully loaded in the evening glow; or happening to encounter several large red motorized junks, just fitted with diesel engines and constantly setting out for the open sea, riding the wind and waves on the surging green sea, who wouldn't linger and be reluctant to leave! But for me, what is the main attraction?

I pondered the answer, staring even more intently at the island's scenery, trying my best to capture each one. At that moment, I suddenly saw a shirtless, short-trousered man climbing the mast of a large fishing boat docked by the island, agile and quick. In the blink of an eye, he reached the top of the mast, as if sitting in the clouds. A moment later, he swiftly flipped down to the deck and went off to do something else. I couldn't help but cheer inwardly, wondering who this was? The figure seemed familiar, could it be Captain (helmsman, captain) Wang Fuxiang, or Chief Engineer Lin Zaihe, or someone else? They all seemed similar, yet not quite. Who could it be? ... Ah, why do I have to guess who it is? Anyway, they are all the same – all intelligent, capable, strong, and brave young people.

Take Wang Fuxiang, for example. He's only twenty-three years old this year but has already been a captain for three years. Being a captain, navigating a ship, and taming the ocean is no simple task; a full boat of lives and the production task rest on one's shoulders, a heavy responsibility. No wonder that in the beginning, some old captains curled their lips in disbelief, saying, "You could fish all your life in the old society, accumulating decades of experience, and still not be able to become a captain." But this is the new society! The island's Party organization deliberately sought out and cultivated a group of young captains, and Wang Fuxiang is one of them. He has grown especially quickly in both political and professional skills, becoming the island's first "young captain" and "red and expert captain." He and a group of young fishermen, on the Youth motorized junk, used outstanding achievements (production has always been the best on the island, never had an accident, created some new operating methods, and invented and improved some new tools, etc.), shattered conservative ideas, and proved that the younger generation, under the leadership of the Party, is capable of anything, far surpassing any previous generation.

When we met him, he unfortunately had a fever. But he couldn't stay in bed. When he heard that the commune was holding a meeting to save grain, he got up and ran over the hill. He's not tall or strong, but he exudes energy. Even though he was ill, he didn't look sick, but rather energetic and full of life. He doesn't talk much, but he's constantly moving, now standing, now sitting, touching this, fiddling with that, just refusing to lie down. His companions laugh at him: "He's really a 'Jiangban,' never idle for a moment!" "Jiangban" is the local dialect for seagull, Wang Fuxiang's nickname.

Seagulls, how beautiful! We really got our fill of them during these few days on the island. This black and white bird, resembling a dove of peace, makes a tender, baby-like cry when it walks along the beach; it is graceful when soaring over the sea; and when it swoops down to eat the small fish swimming in the sea, it is so quick and accurate, even better than an eagle catching a chick, almost breathtaking. But the islanders gave Wang Fuxiang this nickname not only because of these images and movements, but also because of the similarity in character. Seagulls are industrious, never stopping. Wang Fuxiang is the same, no, far more than that. He never stops, not only because of his industrious nature, but also because of his will to constantly revolutionize and strive for improvement. After overcoming the many difficulties of being a captain, he was not satisfied. He also went to learn about machines and fishing nets, learning tirelessly, never stopping, and creating inventions one after another.

There are many such seagull-like young people on Ant Island. One evening, we were visiting a female apprentice's lathe in the island's self-made mechanical repair shop when a young man whirlwinded in, clamoring and requesting: "Please turn another screw for me, ah, another one broke!" Look at his hands covered in oil, his nose, hair, and trousers, all spotted with oil stains, but his childlike face revealed an excited look. His name is Lin Zaihe. Although not as well-known as Wang Fuxiang on the island, he has the same character as Wang Fuxiang. He is the chief engineer on a motorized junk, not a worker in the mechanical repair shop, but when the diesel engine on his boat was sent to the factory for repair, he enthusiastically followed along and threw himself into the repair work. It is said that he worked until after 1 a.m. that night before leaving the factory, but the next morning at 5 a.m., I saw him rushing to the factory again by the sea. Looking at his tense face covered in sweat, I said, "Why are you in such a hurry? You didn't get enough sleep." His eyes were bright, and he replied briskly, "How can I not be anxious? The sooner it's repaired, the sooner we can go to the open sea. The ribbonfish season is coming!" Seeing that I had nothing to say, he added, "I've had enough sleep, can't sleep any more." With that, he strode away quickly.

This morning, I also met Liu Yajuan, whom I had only met the day before. She is one of the island's two earliest female chief engineers. They overcame the difficulty of seasickness with indomitable spirit and finally learned the skills in a short period, pioneering the precedent that women can not only participate in fishing but also master machines and venture into the ocean. She was walking towards the wharf, going to the boat to rush to install the diesel engine, preparing for the voyage. The boat was two or three meters away from the wharf, and she jumped onto the boat with the agility of a swallow. She had experienced the attack of typhoons of magnitude 12 or above in the waters of Lusi, and she had truly been tempered. That was in April last year, her first official voyage as chief engineer, and she hadn't completely overcome seasickness, but she set sail with unwavering confidence. The storm came suddenly, without prior preparation. The motorized junk seemed like a small toy in the raging ocean. The storm howled, the waves roared, the small boat was swinging, tilting left and right, the cabin was full of water, and the machine had long been broken. People couldn't stand firm, let alone control the boat. At that time, people on the boat were panicked and didn't know what to do, and even the captain was so anxious that he shed tears. How could Liu Yajuan not be afraid, her head was so dizzy that she couldn't open her eyes, but she thought to herself that she was a probationary Party member and should fight! She struggled to get up, staggered out to bail water, signaling everyone to calm down and put in effort, and promising to repair the machine and try to break out of the storm. In this way, she repaired the machine and worked together with everyone on the boat to overcome the storm. From then on, no one on the island has ever said anything about women not being able to do it.

But Liu Yajuan is neither proud nor satisfied. She quietly told me that she has an ideal: to learn the skills of being a captain. She believes that a fisherman who can be both a chief engineer and a captain can play a greater role on the boat, at least to solve some of the contradictions between the captain and the chief engineer in their work, so that production can be improved faster. When she said these words, her eyes were shining, and her upright face showed a power that made people unable to disbelieve.

Almost all the young men and women I met on the island were of this type. Examples can be cited in large numbers, such as Wang Songdi, the shore-based chief engineer and deputy director of the power plant, nicknamed "Compressor," Zhu Zaihong, deputy director of the repair shop, and Ying Yonghua, a teacher at the maritime amateur middle school and chief engineer, each of whom has some ordinary and moving model deeds that are praised. Before liberation, they were like little beggars, but after liberation, under the Party's careful cultivation, they became various experts needed to build the island, and they were ambitious and never stopped moving forward, as if a group of eagles suddenly flew out of the sea, heading straight for the high sky. Comrade Chen Amao, secretary of the commune's Party committee, could not suppress his excitement and joy when talking about these young people, saying that these young people are extremely lovely, listen to the Party in everything, and the commune's future is limitless. Indeed, having such a force is invincible and invincible. In fact, the secretary himself is only in his early thirties, about the same age as these young people. We can learn so much from them!

The boat was small, the waves were big, and the boat body was bumping. I leaned tightly against the mast, stood against the wind, and let the spray splashed up by the waves hitting the ship's hull hit me. At this moment, my heart was like the tide, surging and undulating. Because I finally realized the answer: for me, the main attraction is this group of seagulls and eagles! These are ordinary young people, and they are also extraordinary young people. They are ordinary because there are so many of them on this island, and they are extraordinary because they are all contemporary heroes cultivated by the Party. Relying on this young generation that never stops, everyone firmly believes that Ant Island will leap forward faster.

When the ship reached its destination, Shenjiamen, looking back at this "ant" in the sea, it was already shrouded in the morning sun, shining with golden light, so dazzling that people could not open their eyes.

    海岛群鹰
    越人
    清早，浓云漫天，海涛拍岸，我们乘坐的机帆船解缆启航了。我忍不住站到船头高处，返身注视渐离渐远的蚂蚁岛，一眼不眨，深恐它会突然消失在视野里。
    仅仅三天逗留，不想在离别时竟也依依难舍，我不禁自问：是岛上的什么东西，牵住了我的心？
    也许是三百年前发现这岛的周姓渔民的遗址和那些迷人的传说？也许是山峰和浅坳的绮丽风光？眼前岛上人民的冲天干劲，全岛人民勤劳朴素、勤俭办社的风气，实在使人赞佩；而当站在岛上新建的海堤上，看队队渔船在朝霞中扬帆出海、在晚霞中满载而归的情景；或者碰巧遇见不断出航远洋的几条刚刚安装好柴油动力机的红色大机帆船，在汹涌的绿色海面上乘风破浪、疾驰而去的景象；这时候，怕是谁也会留连忘返的啊！但对我来说，什么是最主要的吸引力呢？
    我思索着答案，更加盯紧岛上景物，竭力想把它们一一牢牢捕捉住。这当口，忽见停靠在岛边的一条大渔船里，有个赤膊短袴的人在桅杆上爬着，身手矫健，一转眼就爬到了桅顶，去解开帆篷的绳结还是做什么。那桅杆高耸入云，那人骑在桅顶上就仿佛坐在云端里一般。不一会，一个鹞子翻身，迅疾滑下甲板，又干别的什么去了。我不禁暗暗喝采，猜想这是谁呢？身形似曾相识，莫非是老大（舵手、船长）王福祥，还是老轨（轮机员）林再和，还是别的什么人？都像都不像，到底是谁呢？……嗨，我何必定要猜出是谁，反正一样，他们全是些聪明能干、坚强勇敢的青年人。
    就说那王福祥吧，今年才二十三岁，已经当了三年老大了。当老大，驾驭船只，驯服海洋，可不简单；满船生命，生产任务，一肩挑起，责任重大。怪不得刚开始的时候，有个把老老大撇了撇嘴，很不信任：“旧社会打一辈子鱼，积几十年经验，也未必能当上老大。”可是现在是新社会呀！岛上党组织着意物色、培养了一批青年老大，王福祥就是其中一个。无论在政治上，还是业务上，他都成长得特别快，成了岛上第一个“青年老大”和“红专老大”。他和一批青年渔民，在青年号远洋机帆船上，用出色的成绩（产量一直走在全岛第一，从未出过事故，创造了一些新操作法，发明和改进了一些新工具，等等），击碎了保守思想，证明青年一代在党的领导下无所不能，远远超过以往任何一代。
    我们见到他时，不幸他正发着烧。可是他在床上躺不住，听说公社开节约粮食的大会，拔腿翻过山头就跑来了。他个儿不高，也不粗壮，却显出浑身是劲，虽在病中，却无病容，反倒精神抖擞、生气勃勃。他不大会讲话，也不大讲；可是不停地动弹，一忽儿站，一忽儿坐，摸摸这，弄弄那，就是不肯躺下。他的同伴笑他：“真是‘江板’，一刻也闲不住！”“江板”，是当地的土语，就是海鸥，是王福祥的绰号。
    海鸥，多美啊！我们在岛上的这几日，可真看够瘾了。这种黑白两色的形似和平鸽的漂亮海鸟，当它在海滩边走动的时候，它会发出婴儿般娇嫩的啼声来；当它在大海上翱翔的时候，英姿翩翩；当它俯冲啄食正在海里悠游的小鱼的时候，又快又准，赛过老鹰捕小鸡，简直有些惊心动魄。但海岛人们所以送给王福祥这个绰号，不仅在这些形象和动作上比拟，更因为性格的相似。海鸥是勤劳的，一刻也不停。王福祥也如此，不，远不止此。他一刻不停，不仅是由于勤劳的本性，而且是来自不断革命、发愤图强的意志。他克服了胜任老大工作的重重难关以后，并不满足，他又去摸机器，又去弄渔网，这样那样，好学不倦，永不停留，于是创造发明，接二连三。
    像这样海鸥式的青年，在蚂蚁岛上多的是。有一晚我们在岛上的白手起家的机械修配厂参观一个女徒工的车床时，一个小伙子一阵旋风似地跳了进来，嚷嚷着，请求着：“再给我车个螺丝吧，哎，又断了一个哩！”瞧他两手沾满机油，鼻尖上、头发上、袴子上，斑斑点点，都是油迹，可是孩子般的脸上露出兴奋的神色。他就叫林再和，在岛上虽还不如王福祥那样为大家熟知，但却和王福祥有相同的性格。他是机帆船上的老轨，不是机械修配厂的工人，但当他船上的柴油机被送进厂来修理时，他也就兴致勃勃地跟了过来，热情地投入修理工作。据说当晚他工作到午夜一点多才离厂，可是翌晨五点多钟，我在海边又见他匆匆赶往厂去。望着他汗流满脸的紧张样子，我说：“你何必那么着急，睡得太少了。”他两眼神采奕奕，爽朗地回答：“怎么不急，早些修好早些到远洋，带鱼汛快到了呢！”见我无话可说，他又补了一句：“也睡够了，多睡睡不着。”说着，迈开大步飞也似地走掉了。
    这早晨，我还遇见了才认识不过一天的刘亚娟。她是岛上两个最早的女青年老轨当中的一个，她们用百折不挠的精神战胜了晕船的难关，终于在短期内学成，开创了妇女不仅可以参加捕鱼，而且能够掌握机器、远征海洋的先例。她正往船埠走去，要到船上去赶装柴油机，作远航准备。船离埠有二、三米宽，她一跃便上了船，身轻如燕。她是经历过吕泗洋海面十二级以上的大风浪的袭击的，真锻炼出来了。那是去年4月，她第一次正式远航当老轨，晕船的毛病还没有完全克服，但她带着必胜的信心出海了。那次风暴来得突然，事先不及准备。这机帆船在奔腾咆哮的大海洋中好像一只小玩意一样了。风暴呼啸，浪涛咆哮，小船在荡秋千，一忽儿左斜，一忽儿右倾，满舱是水，机器早坏了。人没法站稳，更别说掌握船只了。当时船上人心惶惶，不知所措，连老大也急得掉泪。刘亚娟心里何尝不害怕，头晕得睁不开眼，可是她心想自己是预备党员，应该斗争！她挣扎起来，跌跌撞撞地往外掏水，示意大家镇静和出力，自己保证把机器修好试着冲出风暴去。就这样，她修好了机器，和全船人同心协力，战胜了风暴。从此，再也没听到岛上谁说过妇女不行之类的闲话了。
    但是刘亚娟既不骄傲，也不满足。她悄悄告诉我，她有一个理想：要学会当老大的本事。她相信一个既能当老轨又能当老大的渔民，在船上能发挥更大作用，至少可以解决老大老轨之间在工作上牵扯难断的某些矛盾，而使产量提高得更快。她说这些话时两眼灼灼发光，端正的脸上显示一种使人不能不信服的力量。
    我在岛上接触到的男女青年，几乎没一个不是这种类型的。例子还可以举出一大堆来，如岸上老轨、发电厂副厂长、绰号叫“压缩机”的王松弟，如修配厂副厂长朱再宏，如海上业余中学教师兼老轨应永华，等等，都各有一些被人传颂着的平凡而又动人的模范事迹。他们在解放前都像一个个小乞丐，解放后在党的精心培育下都成了建设海岛所需的各种各样的专家，而且壮志凌云，永不停息地前进着，仿佛突然从海上飞出一群群大鹰，直望高空冲去。公社党委书记陈阿毛同志谈到这班青年时，总压制不住兴奋喜悦的心情，说这些青年人可爱之至，事事听党的话，公社前途不可限量。确实，拥有这样的一批生力军，是无坚不摧无往不利的。其实书记本人也才三十出头，年纪也和这班青年差不多。从他们那里，我们可以学到多少东西啊！
    船小浪大，船身颠簸，我紧倚桅杆，迎风而立，一任那浪涛撞击船弦迸激起的水珠溅上身来，此刻心潮如同海潮，奔腾澎湃，起伏不已。因为我终于恍然大悟地找到了答案：对我来说，最主要的吸引力，正是这群海鸥、雄鹰啊！这是些普通的青年，又都是些不普通的青年。说普通，是因为他们在这个岛上为数众多，说不普通，是因为他们都是党培育出来的当代英雄。依靠这永不停步的年轻一代，谁都坚信蚂蚁岛将更快飞跃前进。
    船到达目的地沈家门时，回首遥望大海之中这一“蚂蚁”，却已笼罩在朝阳的霞辉里，金光四射，照得人睁不开眼来。
