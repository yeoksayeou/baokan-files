Xinhua News Agency, October 24th. The Chinese Dramatists Association held a reception tonight to see off the Japanese Zenshinza Observation Delegation headed by Kenzo Hirata upon their return to their country.

Tian Han, Cao Yu, Ma Shaobo, A Jia, Li Zhihua, Shi Ruoxu, Ma Lianliang and other famous figures from the Chinese drama circles warmly bid farewell to delegation leader Kenzo Hirata and other Japanese artists at the reception, and toasted to the continuous victories of the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and to the ever-increasing friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people.

Ma Shaobo, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Chinese Dramatists Association, spoke at the reception, praising the Zenshinza's contribution to the progressive Japanese drama cause and in the struggle to defend Japanese national culture and oppose American imperialism and Japanese reactionaries.

Ma Shaobo mentioned that the Zenshinza will soon stage the play "Driven to Join the Liangshan Rebels" in Japan. He said that the Zenshinza Observation Delegation came to our country this time to study "Water Margin" materials and observe Chinese dramatic art, and basically completed the adaptation of the "Driven to Join the Liangshan Rebels" script in just over ten days, mastering the artistic techniques related to performance, music, and fine arts. This drive and eagerness to learn are moving and admirable. He hoped that Chinese and Japanese artists will further learn from each other in the future, further strengthen the artistic exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese people, and enhance the close friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people.

Ma Shaobo condemned the crime of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries in assassinating Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party. He said that the Chinese people resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, and he believes that the Japanese people will never be overwhelmed by U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionaries, and that the Japanese people will continue to advance bravely and will surely achieve complete victory.

Kenzo Hirata then spoke at the reception. He thanked the Chinese drama community for the meticulous care and assistance given to the observation delegation. He also said that the delegation felt great anger upon hearing the news of Inejiro Asanuma's assassination during their visit to China. He stated that the Japanese people are absolutely unwilling to be slaves of American imperialism. The Japanese people will forever advance along the correct path.

During the reception, Chinese and Japanese artists performed wonderful programs.
