Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th—Guangdong Province Governor Chen Yu hosted a banquet tonight to bid farewell to General Ne Win, Chief of Staff of the Defense Forces of the Union of Burma, and his wife.

    Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi and his wife attended the banquet.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the banquet. He said that General Ne Win and his wife visited various parts of China and were warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life, and sowed the seeds of "Paukphaw" (kinship) friendship. During their visit, they gave high praise to the achievements China has made since the Great Leap Forward. He expressed his heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people.

    He said: "China and Burma are both peace-loving countries, advocating peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems on the basis of the Five Principles. However, some countries in the world still do not recognize the People's Republic of China, and are even afraid to recognize the People's Republic of China. They are even afraid of leaders of various countries meeting each other and making contact. The leaders of some countries, even if they have the opportunity to meet, find it difficult to conduct serious discussions on issues of mutual concern and achieve fruitful negotiations. This is because they themselves have neither the confidence nor the sincerity in adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and resolving international disputes through friendly consultations.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "On the contrary, the leaders of peace-loving Asian and African countries have made many mutual friendly visits and achieved many results. In particular, the national leaders of our two countries, China and Burma, have made frequent mutual friendly visits in recent years, with extremely fruitful results. These visits and personal contacts have not only increased mutual understanding, but also made great contributions to the development of Sino-Burmese friendship." He pointed out, "In the current stalemated world situation of the Cold War, Sino-Burmese friendship shines brightly, providing a new track for international friendly cooperation, which deserves our praise and jubilation."

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said: When we celebrate the great development of Sino-Burmese friendship, we cannot fail to mention the efforts and contributions made by His Excellency General Ne Win to enhance the friendship between China and Burma. However, when General Ne Win mentions Sino-Burmese friendship, he always first praises the efforts and contributions made by Prime Minister U Nu. We admire General Ne Win's spirit of unity and wish that this spirit of unity will continue to be promoted and that this spirit of unity will surely benefit the Burmese people.

    General Ne Win said in his speech: "The signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty has not only greatly promoted the friendship between the people of China and Burma, but has also set a good example."

    General Ne Win said that China and Burma have had traditional friendship since ancient times. Since the two countries were ruled by foreign countries, the traditional friendship between the two countries was once interrupted. However, after the two countries gained independence, the governments and people of China and Burma made great efforts to restore Sino-Burmese friendship. He said that Prime Minister U Nu and Premier Zhou Enlai made great contributions to the restoration of Sino-Burmese friendship. The efforts of the two of them not only promoted the friendship between China and Burma, but also led to the settlement of the border issue between the two countries.

    He said: "The Sino-Burmese friendship building has been completed. In order to ensure that the Sino-Burmese friendship building will never be damaged, both of our countries have the responsibility to maintain this building. I can guarantee that the Burmese side will do its best to maintain this building. At the same time, I believe that the Chinese side will also work hard to maintain this building."

    Governor Chen Yu proposed a toast at the banquet. He proposed a toast to the friendship between the people of China and Burma, to world peace, and to the health of General Ne Win and his wife.

    The banquet was filled with "Paukphaw"-like friendship. The hosts and guests toasted each other, congratulating the evergreen Sino-Burmese friendship. Among those attending the banquet were Zhao Ziyang, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Lin Qiangyun, Deputy Governor of Guangdong Province, Xue Yan, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Sun Leyi, Deputy Mayor of Guangzhou, Lieutenant General Wen Niansheng, commander of the Guangzhou Garrison, and responsible persons from relevant departments of the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal People's Committees, the Army, Navy, and Air Force units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou troops, the Guangdong Provincial Committee and Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and various people's organizations, local organizations of various democratic parties, and other aspects. Czechoslovak Consul in Guangzhou, Kobek, and Tran Van Thong, Deputy Consul of the Consulate General of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Guangzhou, were also invited to attend the banquet.

    广东省长盛宴欢送奈温将军
    陈毅副总理说当前冷战僵持的世界局势中中缅友谊大放光明
    奈温将军说一定要尽全力来维护中缅友好大厦永远不受损害
    新华社广州12日电　广东省省长陈郁今晚举行宴会，为缅甸联邦国防军总参谋长奈温将军和夫人饯行。
    国务院副总理陈毅和夫人出席了宴会。
    陈毅副总理在宴会上讲话。他说，奈温将军和夫人在我国各地参观访问，受到了各界人民的热烈欢迎，并且撒播了“胞波”情谊的种子。他们在访问中对我国在大跃进以来所取得的成就，给予很高的评价。他代表中国政府和中国人民表示衷心的感谢。
    他说：“中缅两国都是爱好和平的国家，主张不同社会制度的国家在五项原则的基础上和平共处。但是，世界上有些国家竟仍然不承认中华人民共和国，并且害怕承认中华人民共和国。他们甚至害怕各国领导人互相见面，进行接触。有些国家的领导人，即使有机会见了面，也难于就彼此关心的问题进行认真的商讨，使谈判获得成果。这是因为他们自己对奉行和平共处五项原则和通过友好协商解决国际争端，既没有信心，也没有诚意。
    陈毅副总理说：“与此相反，爱好和平的亚非国家的领导人都进行了多次相互的友好访问，取得了不少的成果。特别是我们中缅两国的国家领导人在最近几年中进行了频繁的相互友好访问，成果极为丰硕。这些访问和个人接触，不仅增进了相互的了解，并对发展中缅友好事业做出了巨大的贡献。”他指出，“在当前冷战僵持的世界局势中，中缅友谊却大放光明，为国际间友好合作提供了新轨道，值得我们称道和欢呼。”
    陈毅副总理说：在我们欢庆中缅友谊大发展的时候，我们不能不提到奈温将军阁下对增进中缅两国友谊所作的努力和贡献。但是奈温将军在提到中缅友谊的时候，总是首先推崇吴努总理所作的努力和贡献。我们钦佩奈温将军这种团结精神，并且祝愿这种团结精神继续发扬光大，这种团结精神定会造福于缅甸人民。
    奈温将军在讲话中说：“中缅友好互不侵犯条约和中缅边界条约的签订，不仅大大促进了中缅两国人民的友谊，同时也树立了良好的榜样。”
    奈温将军说，中缅两国自古以来就有了传统的友谊，自从两国被外国统治后，两国的传统友谊曾一度遭到中断。但是两国各自取得独立以后，中缅两国政府和两国人民为了恢复中缅友谊作了巨大的努力。他说，吴努总理和周恩来总理为恢复中缅两国友谊作出了巨大的贡献。他们两位的努力不仅促进了中缅两国的友谊，并且导致了两国边界问题的解决。
    他说：“中缅友好大厦已经落成。为了使中缅友好大厦永远不受损害，我们两国都有责任来维护这座大厦。我可以保证，缅甸方面一定要竭尽全力来维护这座大厦。同时我相信，中国方面也一定会努力来维护这座大厦。”
    陈郁省长在宴会上祝酒，他提议为中缅两国人民的友谊，为世界和平，为奈温将军和夫人健康干杯。
    宴会充满了“胞波”般的情谊，宾主互相敬酒，祝贺中缅友谊万古长青。出席宴会的，有中共广东省委书记赵紫阳，广东省副省长林锵云，中共广州市委书记薛焰，广州市副市长孙乐宜，广州驻军首长文年生中将，广东省和广州市人民委员会有关部门、中国人民解放军驻广州部队陆海空军部队、政协广东省、广州市委员会以及各人民团体、各民主党派地方组织等各方面的负责人。捷克斯洛伐克驻广州领事考贝克，越南民主共和国驻广州总领事馆副领事陈文通也应邀出席了宴会。
