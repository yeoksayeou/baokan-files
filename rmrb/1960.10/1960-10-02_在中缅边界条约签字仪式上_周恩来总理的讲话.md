Xinhua News Agency, October 1st: Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the signing ceremony of the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty. The full text is as follows:

Respectable Prime Minister U Nu, Respectable General Ne Win, Burmese representatives of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee and other distinguished Burmese guests, Comrades, Friends:

Today, on the grand festival when the Chinese people warmly celebrate the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the nation, our two governments signed the Boundary Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma in our capital. This is a great honor for the Chinese government and the Chinese people. The signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty has opened a new chapter in the history of Sino-Burmese friendly relations, set a good example for Asian countries to coexist peacefully on the basis of the Five Principles, and also set a brilliant example for countries around the world to peacefully resolve international disputes. The conclusion of this treaty not only conforms to the highest interests of China, but also, as Prime Minister U Nu just said, "conforms to the highest interests of Burma, conforms to the highest interests of Sino-Burmese friendship, and the highest interests of peace in Asia and the world." This is a great joyous event for the people of China and Burma, and the people of the world. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I extend the warmest and most sincere congratulations to Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, and the Burmese people who are as close as relatives!

The border issue between China and Burma was caused by the long-term policy of aggression by imperialism. Since China and Burma respectively broke free from the oppression of imperialism and became independent and mutually friendly countries, the nature of the Sino-Burmese border issue has undergone fundamental changes. In 1954, the prime ministers of the two countries jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the guideline for relations between the two countries, which created favorable conditions for resolving this issue. In the process of discussing and resolving the border issue, our two governments adopted an attitude of mutual understanding and mutual concession, and conducted friendly consultations. This enabled the complex border issue to be resolved quickly and reasonably to the satisfaction of both parties. Now, the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty is about to be signed, and the Sino-Burmese border will be fixed in legal form. This is a victory for friendly cooperation between China and Burma, a victory for the friendly unity of the Asian people, and a victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

I sincerely thank Prime Minister U Nu for the praise he just gave to me and my colleagues. I regard this praise as the sincere friendship of the Burmese people towards the Chinese people. At the time of the signing of the Boundary Treaty, I must mention the efforts and contributions of the Burmese side. As early as 1954, Prime Minister U Nu expressed his desire to resolve the Sino-Burmese border issue and has been making sincere efforts for this purpose. Later, the successive Burmese governments also made efforts to seek a solution to the border issue. In January of this year, General Ne Win signed the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression Between China and Burma and the Agreement on the Border Issue with our government in Beijing, paving the way for a quick and smooth resolution of the border issue. Now, Prime Minister U Nu has come to Beijing in person to sign this solemn and friendly Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty with me on behalf of the two governments, finally establishing the peaceful and friendly border that the people of China and Burma have longed for. It should also be specifically mentioned that in the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee, the Burmese representatives, headed by Brigadier Aung Gyi, always worked with our delegation in a friendly and cooperative manner. In addition, thousands of Burmese personnel engaged in surveying, mapping, military affairs, and logistics have been working diligently. Today, when our two governments sign the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, on behalf of the Chinese government and in my own name, I would like to express my lofty respect and heartfelt gratitude to the Burmese government, especially Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, Brigadier Aung Gyi, Ambassador Kyao Wunn, officials of the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other Burmese friends for their valuable contributions to the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty.

On this grand festival of the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, let me shout:

Long live the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty!

Long live the kinship-like friendship between the Chinese and Burmese people!

Long live the victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence!

Long live world peace!

    在中缅边界条约签字仪式上
    周恩来总理的讲话
  新华社1日讯　周恩来总理在中缅边界条约签字仪式上的讲话。全文如下：尊敬的吴努总理阁下，尊敬的奈温将军阁下，中缅边界联合委员会缅方代表及其他缅甸贵宾，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，在中国人民热烈庆祝建国十一周年的盛大节日，我们两国政府在我国首都签订中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦边界条约，这是中国政府和中国人民很大的光荣。中缅边界条约的签订，在中缅友好关系史上开始了新的一章，为亚洲国家在五项原则的基础上和平共处作出了良好的榜样，也为世界各国和平解决国际争端树立了光辉的范例。这个条约的缔结，不但符合中国的最高利益，正如刚才吴努总理阁下所说的也“符合缅甸的最高利益，符合中缅友谊以及亚洲和世界和平的最高利益。”这对中缅两国人民和世界人民来说，都是一件大喜事。我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，向吴努总理阁下，奈温将军阁下和亲如手足的缅甸人民，表示最热烈的、最诚挚的祝贺！
    中缅两国之间的边界问题，是帝国主义长期侵略政策所造成的。自从中国和缅甸分别摆脱了帝国主义的压迫，成为独立的和相互友好的国家以后，中缅边界问题的性质便发生了根本的变化；1954年两国总理共同倡导了和平共处五项原则作为指导两国关系的准则，更为解决这个问题创造了有利的条件。我们两国政府在商谈解决边界问题的过程中，采取了互谅互让的态度，进行友好的协商。这就使复杂的边界问题迅速地得到了双方满意的合理的解决。现在，中缅边界条约就要签订，中缅边界将用法律的形式固定下来。这是中缅两国友好合作的胜利，是亚洲人民友好团结的胜利，也是和平共处五项原则的胜利。
    我衷心感谢刚才吴努总理阁下对我本人和我的同事们所作的赞誉。我把这种赞誉看成是缅甸人民对中国人民的真诚友谊。在边界条约签订的时候，我不能不提到缅甸方面的努力和贡献。早在1954年，吴努总理阁下就表示了解决中缅边界问题的愿望，并且一直为此作了真诚的努力。后来继任的缅甸政府，也曾为寻求解决边界问题的方案作过努力。今年1月，奈温将军阁下在北京同我国政府签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和关于边界问题的协定，为迅速而顺利地解决边界问题铺平了道路。现在，吴努总理阁下又亲来北京和我代表两国政府签订这一庄严而友好的中缅边界条约，使中缅两国人民渴望已久的和平友好的边界终于建立起来了。还应该特别提到，在中缅边界联合委员会中，以昂季准将为首的缅方代表始终以友好合作的态度同我方代表团共同工作。此外，缅方还有几千位勘察、测绘、军事、后勤的人员在从事着辛勤的工作。今天在我们两国政府签订中缅边界条约的时候，我代表中国政府并且以我个人的名义向缅甸政府，特别是吴努总理阁下、奈温将军阁下、昂季准将阁下、叫温大使阁下、缅甸外交部的官员，以及为中缅边界条约的签订作出宝贵贡献的其他缅甸朋友们，表示崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。
    在这个签订中缅边界条约的盛大节日，让我高呼：
    中缅边界条约万岁！
    中缅两国人民亲戚般的友谊万岁！
    和平共处的五项原则的胜利万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（附图片）
