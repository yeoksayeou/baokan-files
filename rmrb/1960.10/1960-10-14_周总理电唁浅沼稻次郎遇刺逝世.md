Xinhua News Agency, 13th. Premier Zhou Enlai today sent a telegram to the headquarters of the Japanese Socialist Party, expressing condolences on the assassination of Mr. Inejiro Asanuma by a fascist thug. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To the Headquarters of the Japanese Socialist Party:

I was shocked to learn of the unfortunate assassination of Mr. Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, by a fascist thug. I hereby send a telegram of condolence and ask your party to convey my sincere condolences to the family of Mr. Inejiro Asanuma.

Mr. Asanuma was an outstanding patriotic politician of Japan and a respected friend of the Chinese people. Just as the Japanese people's just struggle against the United States and for patriotism has achieved great victories, and the Japanese general election is approaching, Mr. Asanuma's assassination is by no means an accidental event. It is a serious signal of a new offensive launched by the US-Japanese reactionaries against the Japanese people. However, this despicable act of the US-Japanese reactionaries will only make themselves more unpopular, will only arouse greater anger among the Japanese people, and will promote the Japanese people to unite in a wider range and carry out struggle.

We guarantee that the Chinese people will always stand with the Japanese people who oppose American imperialist aggression, strive for national independence, safeguard world peace, and promote Sino-Japanese friendship. We firmly believe that the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and the normalization of relations between China and Japan will surely achieve final victory; Mr. Asanuma's unfinished cause will surely be realized with the victory of the Japanese people's struggle.

Zhou Enlai, October 13, 1960

    周总理电唁浅沼稻次郎遇刺逝世
    新华社13日讯　周恩来总理今天致电日本社会党本部，吊唁浅沼稻次郎先生被法西斯暴徒杀害，唁电全文如下：日本社会党本部：
    惊悉日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎先生不幸被法西斯暴徒杀害，谨电吊唁，并且请贵党代向浅沼稻次郎先生家属致以诚挚的慰问。
    浅沼先生是日本卓越的爱国政治家，也是中国人民尊敬的朋友。正当日本人民反美爱国的正义斗争取得了巨大胜利、日本大选即将来临之际，浅沼先生的被刺绝不是一个偶然的事件，它是美日反动派向日本人民发动新的进攻的一个严重讯号，但是，美日反动派的这种卑鄙行径，只会使自己更加丧失人心，只会激起日本人民更大的愤怒，并且促使日本人民在更广泛的范围内团结起来，进行斗争。
    我们保证，中国人民一定永远同反对美帝侵略、争取民族独立、维护世界和平、促进中日友好的日本人民站在一起。我们坚信，日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立和促进中日两国关系正常化的斗争，一定能够取得最后的胜利；浅沼先生未竟的事业，一定能够随着日本人民斗争的胜利而得到实现。
                     周恩来　1960年10月13日
