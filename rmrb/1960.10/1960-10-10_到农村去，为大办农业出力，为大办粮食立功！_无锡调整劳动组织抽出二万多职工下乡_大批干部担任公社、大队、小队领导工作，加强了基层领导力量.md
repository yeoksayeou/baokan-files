Go to the Countryside, Contribute to the Vigorous Development of Agriculture, and Perform Meritorious Service for the Vigorous Development of Grain Production!
Wuxi Adjusts Labor Organization to Extract More Than 20,000 Employees to Go to the Countryside; A Large Number of Cadres Serve as Leaders of Communes, Brigades, and Teams, Strengthening Grassroots Leadership

Nanjing, October 9th (by our newspaper). The broad masses of workers and staff in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, actively respond to the Party's call for vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. While vigorously supporting agriculture with technology and materials, they actively sign up to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production. Now, factories, government offices, schools, shops, and other sectors have saved more than 28,000 cadres, management personnel, and workers through technological innovation, improved management, improved work, and adjusted organizations to strengthen the front line of agricultural production.

Since July of this year, Party organizations at all levels in Wuxi City have comprehensively summarized the previous period's work in support of agriculture. They have extensively carried out propaganda and education among the people of the city, focusing on agriculture as the foundation and vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, further enhancing the masses' awareness of supporting agriculture. The city's workers and staff have successively launched three upsurges of voluntarily signing up to go to the countryside to support agricultural production and increase production. Eighty percent of the city's workers and staff have written letters of determination and posted big-character posters, requesting the Party to approve their going to the countryside. Workers at the Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory all signed up in less than half an hour. Many workers were not approved the first time, so they applied again. Lu Guangzhi, a worker at the Chongan Commune Switch Factory, wrote fifteen letters of determination in a row. Many units saw touching scenes such as wives encouraging husbands, fathers encouraging sons, and brothers vying to sign up. Xu Zhaolou, a worker at the Red Flag Machine Tool Factory, wrote in his letter of determination: "Strong will and fiery heart, earnestly request approval to go to the countryside, to eat, live, and work together, to win a bumper harvest and spread good news; if by any chance I am not approved, I will stay in the factory and make innovations!" Xi Wenjuan, a Communist Party member, and Xi Xie, a member of the Communist Youth League, who were workers at the Zhengde Hosiery Factory, said happily after being approved to go to the countryside at the same time: This is the glory the Party has given us, and we will certainly live up to the expectations of the Party and our comrades!

Under the slogan of "Go to the countryside to work as vanguards, stay in the factory to work as several people combined, support agriculture to win a bumper harvest, and industry and agriculture leap forward together," the broad masses of workers and staff in various factories and enterprises actively sought labor from technological revolution. The workers and staff of the Wuxi Machine Tool Factory made great efforts in technological revolution, and the degree of mechanization was rapidly improved. Under the circumstances of production growth, 385 people were extracted to go to the countryside to support agricultural production. In the past, it took three to four minutes for the tool workshop of this factory to produce a gas washer by hand. The leading cadres and workers of the workshop jointly researched and created a die, which only took a few seconds to punch a gas washer; the work that originally required four people can now be done by one person, and the amount of work completed in one day is more than double that of four people. Therefore, this workshop saved twelve people to go to the countryside. The department cadres of Shenxin Textile Factory implemented the "two-two-four" system, working in the workshop with the workers every day, reducing meetings, simplifying reports, and helping the workers and administrators improve their management level, which significantly improved the efficiency of management work. Sixty-seven people have been extracted successively to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production. Street industries have saved a lot of labor to the countryside through technological innovation, organizational adjustment, etc. County and commune industries have replenished the first line of agricultural production with 11,000 laborers. Through the adjustment of labor organization, the city and county (district) organs have transferred 2,286 leading cadres such as ministers, bureau directors, factory directors, section chiefs and general cadres to the countryside to participate in grassroots work and agricultural production. In addition to extracting a group of people to settle down in the countryside, scientific, educational, cultural and other units also take the method of rotating for three months to one year to send people to the countryside to participate in labor and support agricultural production. Light industry factories and textile factories also regularly send people to the countryside to participate in agricultural production according to the production season.

After this contingent supporting agriculture went to the countryside, it became a vital force in vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. After a large number of cadres went to the countryside, in addition to actively participating in agricultural labor, many also served as deputy secretaries of the Party organizations of communes, brigades, and teams, and deputy captains of production teams, strengthening grassroots leadership. Most of the workers and staff of industrial, financial, and trade enterprises settled in production teams, strengthening the first line of agricultural production; some skilled workers were also sent to commune farm tool factories, farm tool repair stations, and electric machinery irrigation stations to serve as technical backbones. In addition to participating in agricultural labor, the people sent to the countryside from scientific, cultural, educational, and health units also used their spare time to engage in agricultural scientific research, mobile medical services, etc., or helped carry out amateur cultural education, cultural entertainment, and other activities.

As soon as the urban cadres and workers who went to the countryside arrived in the countryside, they worked and lived with the peasants and quickly played a good role in production. This year, "1240" high-efficiency pesticides were used for the first time in the farmland of Wuxi County. Because the commune members lacked experience, the pesticide effect could not be fully exerted. Two hundred and fifty workers from the Wuxi City Chemical Industry System who went to the countryside immediately formed a pest control professional team to be responsible for technical guidance and help break through the technical barrier of using new pesticides. The workers who worked in the Changqiao Brigade of the Taihu Commune, together with the original commune members, used nearby power sources to convert the foot-operated threshing machine into an electric threshing machine, which improved threshing efficiency and accelerated the autumn harvest progress. The employees who went to the countryside also participated in running public canteens well, such as developing non-staple food production and improving the management system, so that the lives of the commune members were further improved and the enthusiasm for production was even greater.

A large number of urban cadres and workers going to the countryside to participate in agricultural production has strengthened the power of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, which is a great encouragement to the peasants. At present, hundreds of thousands of mu of middle rice in Wuxi has been basically harvested. The broad masses of commune members are advancing victoriously, strengthening the field management of late autumn crops on the one hand, and carrying out a production increase campaign centered on autumn plowing and autumn planting on the other.

    到农村去，为大办农业出力，为大办粮食立功！
    无锡调整劳动组织抽出二万多职工下乡
    大批干部担任公社、大队、小队领导工作，加强了基层领导力量
    本报南京9日电　江苏省无锡市广大职工积极响应党的大办农业、大办粮食的号召，在从技术、物资等方面大力支援农业的同时，积极报名下乡参加农业生产。现在，工厂、机关、学校、商店等各行各业，通过革新技术，改进管理，改进工作和调整机构等，先后节约出二万八千多名干部、管理人员和工人，到农村去加强农业生产第一线。
    今年7月以来，无锡市各级党组织在全面总结前一时期支援农业工作的基础上，向全市人民广泛进行了以农业为基础和大办农业、大办粮食的宣传教育，进一步提高了广大群众支援农业的自觉性。全市职工先后掀起了三次自愿报名下乡支援农业增产的热潮。全市80％的职工都写了决心书，贴出大字报，请求党批准他们到农村去。无锡柴油机厂职工，不到半小时就全都报了名。许多职工都是一次没有批准，就再次提出申请。崇安公社开关厂工人陆广志就一连写了十五次决心书。许多单位出现了妻子鼓励丈夫、父亲勉励儿子、兄弟争先报名等动人情景。红旗机床厂工人徐兆楼在决心书上写道：“坚强的意志火热的心，恳求批准下农村，同吃同住同劳动，夺得丰收传佳音；如若万一不批准，安心留厂闹革新！”正德袜厂工人、共产党员奚文娟和共青团员奚爕两姊妹同时被批准下乡以后，高兴地说：这是党给我们的光荣，我们一定不辜负党和同志们的期望！
    各工厂企业的广大职工在“下乡劳动当尖兵，留厂工作一顶几，支援农业夺丰收，工业农业齐跃进”的口号下，积极向技术革命要劳力。无锡机床厂职工大闹技术革命，机械化程度迅速提高，在生产增长的情况下，抽出三百八十五人下乡支援农业生产。这个厂的工具车间，原来用手工生产一只瓦斯垫圈，需要三分钟到四分钟。车间领导干部和工人共同研究，创造了冲模，冲一只瓦斯垫圈仅花几秒钟；原来四个人的工作，现在一个人就能干，一天完成的工作量还比四个人时增加了一倍。因此，这个车间节约了十二个人到农村去。申新纺织厂的科室干部推行了“二二四”制度，每天在车间和工人一起劳动，减少了会议，简化了报表，并且帮助工人管理员提高了管理水平，使管理工作的效率显著提高，已先后抽出六十七人下乡参加农业生产。街道工业通过革新技术、调整机构等，节约出不少劳动力到农村。县社工业充实农业生产第一线的劳动力有一万一千人。全市市、县（区）机关通过调整劳动组织，已抽调部长、局长、厂长、科长等领导干部和一般干部二千二百八十六人下放到农村，参加基层工作和农业生产。科学教育文化等单位除抽出一部分人到农村落户外，还采取轮流下放三个月到一年的办法，派人到农村参加劳动，支援农业增产。轻工业工厂和纺织厂也根据生产季节，定期派人下乡参加农业生产。
    这支支援农业的队伍下乡以后，成为大办农业、大办粮食的生力军。大批干部到农村以后，除积极参加农业劳动外，不少人还分别担任了公社、大队、小队的党组织的副书记、生产队的副队长等职务，加强了基层领导力量。工业、财贸等企业的职工，大部分到生产队落户，加强了农业生产第一线；一部分技术工人还被派往公社农具厂、农具修配站、电力机械灌溉站等，充当了技术骨干。科学、文化、教育、卫生等单位的下乡人员，除参加农业劳动外，还利用业余时间，从事农业的科学研究、巡回医疗等工作，或者帮助开展业余文化教育、文化娱乐等活动。
    下乡的广大城市干部和工人一到农村，就和农民一起劳动，一起生活，迅速在生产中发挥了良好作用。今年无锡县农田第一次使用“1240”高效农药，由于社员缺乏经验，药效不能充分发挥；无锡市化学工业系统的二百五十名下乡工人，立即组成治虫专业队，负责技术指导，帮助突破了使用新农药的技术关。到太湖公社长桥大队劳动的工人，同原来的社员们一起，利用附近电源将脚踏脱粒机改成电动脱粒机，提高了脱粒效率，加快了秋收进度。下乡职工还参加办好公共食堂，如发展副食品生产，健全管理制度等，使社员生活进一步改善，生产劲头更足。
    大批城市干部和工人下乡参加农业生产，增强了大办农业、大办粮食的力量，对农民们鼓舞很大。现在，无锡几十万亩中稻已经基本收割完毕。广大社员正乘胜前进，一面加强晚秋作物田间管理，一面开展以秋耕、秋种为中心的增产运动。（附图片）
