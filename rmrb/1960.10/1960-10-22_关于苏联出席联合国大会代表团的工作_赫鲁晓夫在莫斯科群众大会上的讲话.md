Speech by Khrushchev at a Mass Meeting of Moscow Workers on the Work of the Soviet Delegation to the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly

Dear comrades of Moscow!

Dear comrades and friends listening to my speech in other cities and villages of our great motherland!

I would like to talk to you about our impressions of participating in the fifteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly and, as is customary, to report on the work done there.

If someone asks whether it was worth going to New York to participate in this session, then it can be said without reservation that not only was it worth it, but it was necessary to go. Now the whole world acknowledges that this session has special significance.

The Soviet government believes that this session must discuss the most urgent and vital issues of our time. We believe that statesmen bearing the highest responsibility should participate in the United Nations General Assembly. The U.S. government and its allies attempted to undermine this proposal, but, as everyone knows, they achieved nothing.

Our position was met with the most enthusiastic support from all socialist countries and received broad understanding and sympathy from the governments of many countries around the world. To avoid isolation, the President of the United States, the Prime Ministers of Britain, Canada, Australia, and some of their other allies were forced to change their minds halfway and rush to participate in the session.

As world public opinion has justly pointed out, the fifteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly is the most representative international conference in modern history. There were more than thirty heads of state, government leaders, and major political figures from various countries present.

Many extremely important international issues were submitted for discussion at this session. The Soviet delegation proposed discussing such urgent issues as complete and general disarmament, the elimination of colonialism and the granting of independence to all peoples and countries, the issue of American aggression against other countries, the need to change the structure of the executive bodies of the United Nations. Issues such as the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, the Algerian question, and many others were also included in the agenda.

The participation of delegations led by the leaders of socialist countries, as well as the heads of state and government leaders of many other member countries of the United Nations, brought about significant results.

In the assembly hall, everyone listened with great attention and interest to the speeches of many outstanding statesmen of our time. The speeches of the heads of the delegations of socialist countries made a deep impression. They were: Comrade Novotny, President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, Comrade Gomulka, head of the Polish delegation, Comrade Gheorghiu-Dej, head of the Romanian delegation, Comrade Kadar, head of the Hungarian delegation, Comrade Zhivkov, head of the Bulgarian delegation, Comrade Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania. Comrade Podgorny, head of the Ukrainian delegation, and Comrade Mazurov, head of the Byelorussian delegation, also spoke at the session.

The speeches of the heads of the delegations of socialist countries resounded throughout the world. This is the voice of a new, just world that brings happiness to the people and prosperity to the world. Their speeches were also a severe condemnation of the imperialist, colonialist world, which clings to everything outdated and rejected by history, posing a threat to peace and the security of the peoples of all countries.

The speeches of the President of Ghana, Nkrumah, the President of Guinea, Sekou Toure, the President of Indonesia, Sukarno, the Prime Minister of India, Nehru, the President of the United Arab Republic, Nasser, the head of state of Cambodia, Sihanouk, and other representatives of independent countries made an important contribution to the struggle for peace and the struggle to eliminate the colonialist system that is hated by the people. The vivid speech of the son of the Cuban people's hero, Cuban Prime Minister Castro, made a deep impression. Other statesmen also made many constructive suggestions in their speeches.

The representatives of imperialist forces, the defenders of colonialism, often tried to maintain and defend their positions openly, and more often in a disguised form. Therefore, as everyone already knows, fierce struggles often erupted at the session that had never occurred in this international organization.

From the point of view of the many meetings we held and the exchange of views with statesmen of different countries on a series of urgent international issues, our trip was beneficial. All this contributed to a better mutual understanding and the establishment of closer relations among the countries.

Over the years since the founding of the United Nations, many things have accumulated that need to be decisively changed to make them suitable for the current configuration of world forces. It can be said that the main line of the first stage of the work of the fifteenth session of the General Assembly was the struggle between new, progressive things and old, outdated things that hinder the development and growth of new things.

Dear comrades, now let me talk a bit more about the main points of the current international situation and the activities of our delegation at the fifteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly.

I. Changes in the world since the founding of the United Nations

Comrades! Many people consider the fifteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly to be a special session, and this is absolutely correct. The session made certain summaries of the work done by the United Nations since its founding.

The session correctly pointed out that over the past fifteen years, significant political and social changes have taken place in the world.

These changes are primarily that a powerful camp of socialist countries has emerged. Now more than a billion people live and work under the banner of socialism. The emergence of the world socialist system has decisive significance for the development of all mankind and for the fate of humanity.

After the Second World War, during the period of the creation of the United Nations, the capitalist system dominated the world, and the colonial system was still quite stable. In the fifteen years since the war, significant social transformations have taken place. A series of socialist countries have emerged in Europe and Asia. They not only emerged but also quickly consolidated themselves, defended their revolutionary achievements, and demonstrated their superiority over the capitalist system in the development of the economy and the improvement of the welfare of the people, in the development of science and culture.

In the speed of production development, in the exploration of space, and in the peaceful use of atomic energy, it is precisely the socialist countries that are in the lead.

Some people accuse us communists of being violent, saying that we are only good at organizing people to seize power, that we trample on individual freedom, but are not good at building, not good at organizing industry and agriculture. Our enemies say that we do not promote science and culture. They used to say that revolution is destructive, not constructive. Where have these voices gone, where have these poor prophets gone? They have tucked their tails and kept quiet! How can they keep quiet? Otherwise, how can they keep quiet?

Now the whole world knows very well that true freedom, high-speed development of the national economy, and cultural prosperity are where the people have won, where new factors in the organization of society prevail, that is, where socialism has won. Under the conditions of socialism, free people build a new life on the basis of the teachings created by the great thinkers of humanity, Marx, Engels, and Lenin. The fruits of this teaching are now visible to everyone, perhaps with the exception of political blind people.

The colonialist world has also undergone significant changes during this period. The colonialist empire is collapsing. It can be said that the colonialist empire has collapsed and is now crumbling into pieces. In Asia, countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon have freed themselves from colonial oppression. The liberation movement of the African peoples is flourishing. The long-suffering African peoples have finally gained human rights.

All these great changes in the world cannot be ignored. At the time of the founding of the United Nations after the Second World War, the political situation in the world was not as it is now, and it was the political situation at that time that determined the structure of this international organization.

In those years, the United States dominated the entire world. At that time, this country was the richest and strongest economically, and it seemed that it was precisely this that predetermined the United Nations and its headquarters to be located in the United States. This created great inconvenience geographically, not to mention that the order in the United States was not conducive to the establishment of such an international organization there. If we were to choose the location of the United Nations headquarters now, the African peoples, the black people, might not agree to place the United Nations headquarters in a country that does not consider black people as human beings, where black people suffer the most brutal discrimination, even to the point of being lynched.

All this and many other factors in international life indicate that it is now necessary to re-evaluate various values and to adopt a new attitude towards the solution of important world problems.

The United Nations was correctly established with the main purpose of ensuring peace and solving the problems that cause tension and could lead to the outbreak of a third world war. At that time, the main attention was focused on the establishment of an institution capable of dealing with international difficulties and conflicts. The purpose of establishing the Security Council was precisely this.

The Security Council was composed of eleven member states, including five permanent members, which was quite correct at that time. It was then decided that the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France would be the permanent members.

I would like to point out especially that it was precisely these five countries, which were then considered great powers, that became the permanent members of the Security Council. The political activists who were the organizers of the United Nations at that time were wise in that they recognized that each great power in the Security Council had equal rights, despite the fact that at that time socialist countries were in an absolute minority in the world. At that time, only the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic were socialist countries, but the Soviet Union, a socialist country, was recognized as having these rights equal to those of the other permanent members of the Security Council. The principle of unanimity of the great powers and the veto power, as stipulated in the United Nations Charter, is an expression of the recognition of this principle of equality. No one can adopt a decisive decision harmful to peace and harmful to one of the five great powers, even if it is four against one.

In short, at that time, capitalist countries dominated the world. However, the considerations of the founders of the United Nations were correct, as they believed that only in the case where the majority—this majority being capitalist and colonialist countries—does not abuse its position against the minority, can the United Nations fulfill the tasks entrusted to it. Only in this case can the United Nations exist, develop, and function, and it is precisely for this purpose that the United Nations was established.

What is the political situation in the world at the time of the convening of the fifteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly? I repeat, this situation is now quite different from what it was at the time of the founding of the United Nations.

I have already said that first of all, a world socialist system has emerged, and the countries of this system have more than one-third of the world's population. Socialist countries have enormous economic potential, and at present, their production already accounts for more than one-third of the world's total production, and in many extremely important areas of industrial and agricultural production, they account for almost half of the world's production.

Secondly, on the ruins of the colonialist system, many independent countries have emerged that pursue a policy of non-participation in military blocs. These are India, Indonesia, Burma, the United Arab Republic, the Republic of Ghana, the Republic of Guinea, the Republic of Nigeria, and others.

The situation of the former colonialist, imperialist great powers has also undergone significant changes. Now, according to what law can it be considered that Britain is a great power, while India is not a great power? Previously, those who held the big stick were considered great powers, and according to what law. At that time, the main colonialist power was precisely Britain. It subjected other countries to its rule with fire and sword and ruled with a big stick. It almost controlled half the world and established its power in this way. Now the situation has changed. After the end of the Second World War, Britain had to write off the things it had lost in the past. What it still retains and the way it brutally suppresses certain colonial countries with force, this shows that its power is declining, not rising. Its soldiers are still walking the path of the Victorian era, and some people in Britain do not want to understand that this is another era. Britain is no longer the first world factory, no longer the ruler of the seas.

France is also an imperialist colonialist country, and it became strong in the same way—by plundering and brutally enslaving the peoples of Africa and Asia. Now, this great power has been at war with Algeria for more than six years and has shown no sign of greatness in stopping its policy of robbery. Times have changed. Now, the peoples of various countries are waging a life-and-death struggle against their oppressors, their colonizers, for freedom, and are successfully fighting for the defense of their human rights.

Why is France considered a great power, while Indonesia is not? Why are the conditions of India and Indonesia in the United Nations different from those of Britain and France, for example, they are not permanent members of the Security Council?

Or take the United States. It is still the strongest capitalist country. However, if previously the United States was an attraction, considered a rising country of monopoly capital, and attracted by its bourgeois democratic constitution, then this point has now disappeared. Today, the United States is a reactionary country ruled by monopoly capital, a country pursuing an imperialist policy, associated with colonizers and becoming the leader of the colonizers.

In the United States, despite the existence of a democratic facade, everything is subject to and subservient to capital and militarism. Monopoly capital controls everything: the means of production and production tools, as well as powerful means of ideological influence such as newspapers, publishing houses, television, radio, and film. All these are used to suppress the will of the people and deceive the masses.

Previously, the United States stood out in the world in terms of its economic development and strength. It was separated from Europe and Asia by vast oceans, which was an insurmountable obstacle during the period of the rise of wars in Europe and Asia. War, hunger, destruction—all this the United States did not experience. Now, the ocean is no longer the only impregnable fortress of the United States. The United States and its special economic position are being lost.

The Soviet Union and all socialist countries have achieved great successes in economic development. In many scientific fields, in education, culture, and art, we have surpassed the United States, not to mention the superiority of the political and social system of the peoples of socialist countries.

The United States has lost the attraction it once had. On the contrary, now the forces that separate the peoples and countries of the world from the United States are at work. This is an important change. The Americans themselves have not yet fully realized this, and it can be said that many people in the world have not yet realized this, but they feel it, although they have not drawn conclusions from the already changed conditions. Therefore, the United States is no longer such a great power on the international stage as it was before, although it is the strongest in economic and military terms among capitalist countries.

At the time of the founding of the United Nations, China was divided and barely considered. If the monopoly capitalist countries included it in the Security Council, then obviously this was done to make China dependent on the capitalist world and to prevent it from being infected by socialist ideas, that is, Marxist-Leninist ideas. The imperialist countries wanted to preserve the Great Wall of China and make this wall serve monopoly capital, becoming a fortress that separates the socialist world from the capitalist world.

However, the Chinese people determined for themselves how they would live according to their own will. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people achieved great victories in the heroic struggle for liberation. The Chinese people successfully utilized the favorable situation that emerged after the Second World War, when the fascist forces in Europe were defeated and militarist Japan was defeated. This created a reliable rear for the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army defeated the Kuomintang army, which was then completely on the side of the United States, on the side of imperialism.

After China became a people's, truly Chinese country, and after its government truly reflected the will and aspirations of the people, the imperialist monopoly capitalist countries did not recognize it. The imperialists do not recognize the China of the Chinese people, but recognize the island of Taiwan, which is occupied by the Americans, as "China." They even do not allow People's China to enter the United Nations and occupy its lawful seat.

Why did this happen? Has China disappeared? No, China exists! Is China no longer a great power? No, China is now a truly great power, stronger in economic and political terms. They do not recognize China because China is a socialist country. The fear that arose due to the emergence of socialist China made the imperialists lose their sanity, and they deny the existence of the China of the Chinese people.

However, we know that there have been similar situations in history. For a long time, the most shameless imperialists considered the Soviet Union not a great power, but only a geographical concept. The United States did not recognize the Soviet Union for sixteen years. I repeat, we know of similar situations.

Indeed, recently even many bourgeois politicians have seen that the American policy towards China is unwise and condemn this policy. It is becoming more and more difficult for the United States to insist on a policy of non-recognition of People's China, and the mechanical majority has been thwarted at the sessions of the General Assembly, and the policy of mechanical majority towards China has been exposed. It seems that in the near future this policy will be completely shattered. If God does not punish the leaders of the United States and does not deprive them of their reason, then for them it would be best to advocate the restoration of China's rights in the United Nations and the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet. Will the leaders of the United States be able to use God's grace? We cannot predict, time will tell! But if they act unreasonably, then in the near future they will suffer the consequences of their policy towards People's China.

People's China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Burma, and other countries in Asia are playing an increasingly important role in international life and world politics.

In Africa, significant changes have also taken place in recent years. At the time of the founding of the United Nations, there were actually only three independent countries in Africa. The entire continent was divided among the colonialists, who oppressed the peoples of Africa for several decades. Now, Africa is completely different. Now, there are twenty-six independent countries on this continent with a population of more than 180 million. It is particularly noteworthy that the majority of these countries (sixteen out of twenty-six) declared independence this year, 1960.

The representatives of the young African countries attending the United Nations General Assembly said that 1960 is the year of Africa. The entire continent is ablaze with the fire of national liberation movements. However, today there are still more than twenty countries and trust territories on the African continent under colonial oppression. In these countries, more than 50 million people live. The peoples of the colonies and dependent countries are fighting against foreign oppression and will undoubtedly achieve independence.

These are some of the features of the world's social and political situation in the fifteen years since the founding of the United Nations.

The imperialist countries—monopoly capitalist countries that are members of the Western military blocs—attempt to consolidate their dominant position in the United Nations, which they occupied at the time of its founding, by force. They are willing to do anything to maintain this dominance, although in fact history has deprived them of this right, or rather, this possibility. The original economic advantage on which the imperialist countries relied to oppress many countries in the world is being lost. The military advantage on which the imperialist countries relied in pursuing their "position of strength" policy is also being lost.

However, the ruling circles of the imperialist countries always have such an illusion as if they still maintain their former dominance.

Therefore, it was natural and completely justified for the Soviet delegation to raise the issue of the obsolescence of the structure of the United Nations at the fifteenth session of the General Assembly. This structure, which was in accordance with the balance of power, influence, and significance of the countries at the time of the founding of the United Nations, that is, in 1945, is completely out of touch with the present times. It is necessary to change the structure of the United Nations according to the new balance of power relations among the three main types of countries—socialist countries, imperialist countries, and neutralist countries—on the international stage. The necessity for this has matured and has been supported and understood by many participants of this session.

We have not yet made specific proposals, but we have expressed our principled position on this issue.

We raised the issue of changing the structure of the executive bodies of the United Nations, not because we ourselves want some privileges in the United Nations. Our position (the position of socialist countries) is now well known, and no sane person can deny the leading role of socialist countries in the United Nations.

Without socialist countries, it cannot be considered a true United Nations. Why? Someone might say that socialist countries are now a minority. But whoever thinks that the role of one type of country or another in the United Nations depends on the number of countries of that type is a fool. If countries that have half the power of the world and one-third of the world's population have no representation in the United Nations, then the United Nations truly loses its meaning as a world organization.

The achievements of socialism are attractive even to those who do not recognize our system but cannot ignore its flourishing development. Only a blind man can ignore this. He says that the world does not exist, the sun does not exist, and what others say about the world and the sun is a myth.

We believe that the United Nations should be improved to become an international organization aimed at preventing a new world war. For this, first of all, it is necessary to return to the ideas and principles established at the time of the founding of the United Nations and the United Nations Security Council, that is, to recognize the principle of equality of all countries, especially those that decide whether a new world war will break out or not.

If at the time of the founding of the United Nations, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France were called the five great powers, then now the list of great powers must be greatly expanded. Of course, now it is impossible to include France and Britain in this list while excluding India and Indonesia, not to mention restoring the rights of People's China.

The imperialist colonial countries, acting in the interests of their own group, have undermined some of the foundations laid at the time of the founding of the United Nations. They began to evade the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that the Security Council should resolve the most important issues with the unanimous agreement of the five great powers—the permanent members of the Security Council. When the representatives of the Western countries cannot pass their decisions, they take a detour and bring these issues directly to the United Nations General Assembly.

In this way, the extremely important principle of unanimity of the Security Council, which was established to ensure peace, is being undermined by them. They evade this principle and want to resolve such issues in the United Nations General Assembly with a mechanical majority or a two-thirds majority, hoping that the voting machine will bring them luck. However, one should know that this is not the way out of the predicament. They can only open the valves of conflicts that will lead humanity to the abyss of a world war.

Such a situation will increase the danger that the United Nations itself may push the world to the brink of war or to the abyss of war. It is necessary to strictly adhere to the principle of unanimity of the great powers in the United Nations Charter in resolving the most complex international issues. However, this is only one aspect of the problem. It is also necessary to consider the changed conditions in the world and the new balance of power on the world stage. The representation of the five great powers as permanent members of the Security Council is now obviously insufficient.

Therefore, it is now necessary to establish the organizational structure of the United Nations in such a way that the three types of countries—socialist countries, imperialist countries, and neutral countries—have equal status in resolving international issues that largely determine war and peace.

Whoever clings to the old, does not recognize new things, does not understand that the old things will not help to strengthen peace. In these old things, there is a great danger of war. Whoever does not consider the interests of all three types of countries and wants to use international organizations to serve the interests of one type of country, that is, the imperialist monopoly capitalist countries, is not acting in the interests of strengthening peace.

Therefore, it is necessary to change the structure of the United Nations so that its executive bodies conform to the requirements of life and the principle of equal representation of all three types of countries. Otherwise, this will not be the United Nations but the United Nations of division.

Above, I talked about changing the structure of the Security Council. Of course, this fully applies to the executive bodies of the United Nations, including its Secretary-General. No matter how wide a person's forehead is, he cannot objectively reflect the interests of three types of countries at once.

Naturally, due to the current dominance of the United States, which pursues imperialist colonialist policies, as well as its allies Britain, France, and other monopoly capitalist countries, the United Nations leadership positions are filled by people proposed by them. Who proposed the current Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Hammarskjöld? Everyone knows very well that he is the candidate of the United States. Swedes say that he is the representative of Sweden. Indeed, he was born in Sweden, but in political views, he is a representative of American monopoly capital, and he serves them. Let the Swedes not complain about this. We also have our own Hammarskjöld in the United States, and that is Kerensky. He is a Russian, but whom does he serve? He serves American imperialist capital, and the Russian people have achieved great successes without him for many years.

Of course, each type of country wants to have its own candidate for Secretary-General. This is natural, but it is not realistic. Each type of country that wants to put forward its representative in the executive bodies of the United Nations wants to be dominant, therefore we advocate that no type of country should dominate in the executive bodies of the United Nations—the Secretariat.

Therefore, the most fundamental and fair way to solve the problems of the Secretariat of the United Nations and the Security Council is to implement the principles of equal rights, equal opportunities, and equal representation. The Secretariat of the United Nations should consist of three secretaries.

Someone might object, saying that how can problems be solved then, because then it will be very complicated. In the parliament of a country, especially in the parliament of a bourgeois country, solving problems is also complicated, because there are opposing classes there, each class has its party, its representatives. The ruling class implements its policy, that is, the policy of suppressing other classes. They rely on capital to do this, and capital is a great force. Capital does not participate in the vote, but it can buy, and therefore it expresses its opinion by buying the representatives of other classes. But this is still one country.

Transplanting this parliamentary system to an international organization is unreasonable. The United Nations includes about one hundred countries, and today the world is clearly divided into three country systems. If one starts to suppress this or that type of country, this means taking the path of using force, the path of preparing for war. But one should know that the United Nations was not established for war, but as a tool to ensure peace.

To ensure lasting peace, it is necessary that the interests of no type of country are violated, and that the resolution of international issues takes into account the interests of all three types of countries. Only under these conditions can peace be ensured.

If the United Nations, the Security Council, the General Assembly, and the executive bodies follow a one-sided policy and do not consider the interests of all three types of countries, then in this case, the United Nations itself and its resolutions will not be respected by all countries. In this case, no type of country can demand that other countries must execute the resolutions passed. Such a situation will bring international tension to a peak, to the point where a spark can ignite the flames of a world war.

Since the end of the Second World War, the German problem has not been solved. Large and small countries have joined the United Nations, but the German people have not. The United Nations has admitted Italy, Japan, which was once a militarist country, as well as the fascist countries of Spain and Portugal. Why does the United Nations not have a representative of the German people? Because the peace treaty with Germany has not been signed. The imperialist countries deliberately delay the signing of the treaty and want to use this method to deny the existence of the German Democratic Republic. But this is a foolish policy, because the German Democratic Republic has existed and developed for eleven years. It is necessary to end this phenomenon and sign the peace treaty with Germany. It is necessary to solve this problem and confirm the situation and changes that have occurred after the war, so that the German people can have their own representative in the United Nations on an equal footing.

I repeat, the signing of the peace treaty with Germany is of great significance for easing international tension. Maintaining a state of war with Germany has no other result than poisoning the atmosphere, because all the problems that need to be solved at the time of signing the treaty have been acknowledged in fact.

Obviously, now it is necessary to solve these problems according to objective reality, and it is only necessary to confirm the existing situation of the existence of two Germanies and the inviolability of the borders established after the Second World War.

No sane politician can imagine that the German Democratic Republic will yield or abandon its socialist achievements, or that West Germany today will abandon its political and social system. Therefore, it is necessary to acknowledge the situation that has already formed in fact and record these in the corresponding treaties.

On the issue of West Berlin, we have also repeatedly proposed reasonable solutions.

The German problem is now being used to achieve political purposes and is being utilized in election campaigns in some countries.

The United States is now holding presidential elections. The German problem inevitably appears in the election campaigns: the status of Germany will change or not change, that is, whether to sign a peace treaty with two Germanies or maintain the status quo—this is often a hotly debated topic in the elections. The aggressive groups advocating the preservation of the source of war are trying to use the German problem to promote their "position of strength" policy. And it is dangerous to compete in strength on such issues.

In West Germany, there are also people who use the issue of the peace treaty with Germany. Thus, a situation arises, for example, where people say that in 1960 it is not possible to raise the issue of solving the German problem, it is not possible to reach an agreement on this issue, because the U.S. presidential election hinders this. Someone hints to us that during the election, do not talk about the German problem, and after the election, it will be possible to create conditions for a more realistic attitude towards solving the German problem.

And so on, without end, the extremely important issue of signing the peace treaty with Germany is being delayed, while this issue is urgently needed to be solved, and the postponement of this issue harbors great military dangers.

This issue must be solved. It seems that it must be solved in 1961.

Healthy reason must prevail! It is necessary to sign the treaty, and then in Europe one can breathe in a completely different way.

The steps taken by West Germany against the German Democratic Republic (breaking trade agreements, etc.) are leading to a sharpening of relations, because the German Democratic Republic can also take corresponding steps. All this is not a harbinger of improving international relations.

Therefore, it is necessary, as we agreed with the Western countries after the United States sabotaged the Paris Conference, not to take steps that will sharpen relations. We propose to hold a summit meeting after the U.S. presidential election to make new efforts to resolve disputes, to discuss the issue of signing a peace treaty with two Germanies, and on this basis to solve the West Berlin problem, making it a free city.

We adhere to this position. However, if someone imposes another policy on us, then the Western imperialist countries will be responsible for it.

II. Comprehensive and thorough disarmament is the path to strengthening peace

Comrades! The Soviet Union has not once said that the issue of disarmament is the key to all major international issues of our time.

For decades, humanity has striven to free the world from destructive wars, to avoid arms races, and to stop the competition in improving weapons of mass destruction. In the past, these hopes were all in vain. When the exploiting classes dominated the world, when society was divided by the irreconcilable class contradictions exacerbated by imperialism to the limit, and when more than half of humanity suffered from colonial oppression, wars between countries for the division of the world became a constant companion of social life.

Before the emergence of the world socialist system, any attempt to escape from war was nothing more than a beautiful dream and a fantasy. Sometimes these beautiful dreams and fantasies became tools to deceive people. It is worth recalling, for example, that during the First World War, the bourgeoisie insisted that this war should be won by the Allies to prevent future wars. But we know that after the First World War, there were still many wars, and finally, with the connivance of the imperialists of the United States, Britain, and France, the fascists launched the even more destructive Second World War.

Now, when science has created weapons of unprecedented destructive power, any new world war will bring endless disasters and suffering to humanity. We are convinced that if a new war breaks out, humanity will not be destroyed, but humanity will definitely and resolutely get rid of the rotten capitalist system that produces wars. But the question is, is it necessary to pay such a terrible price to achieve the victory of the new system? Must the victory of the new system be achieved at the cost of the blood and lives of hundreds of millions of people? Is there no other way?

Every sensible person understands that it is necessary to create conditions to eliminate the possibility of some countries waging war to enrich themselves at the expense of others. Marxist-Leninists see this possibility.

We Marxist-Leninists are deeply aware of the entire complexity of the issue of war and peace. War arises with the division of society into classes. With the elimination of the phenomenon of dividing society into the rich and the poor, the owners and the non-owners, the exploiters and the exploited, with the establishment of a new social system (this system is not based on the bourgeois principle of "man is a wolf to man"), the danger of war and the soil for the outbreak of war will be completely and irrevocably eliminated.

Such a world will have nothing in common with the capitalist world, where the law of the jungle prevails. In the imperialist countries, whoever has capital has everything. And the ordinary working people who create all material and spiritual wealth but have no capital and are deprived of the means of production suffer exploitation and discrimination.

The ruling circles of the United States boast of the so-called "American way of life" as an example for the "free world." But what kind of freedom is this? This is the freedom of exploitation, the freedom of plunder, the freedom to starve to death in the midst of abundance, the freedom to be unemployed in the presence of unused productive capacity. The freedom of the United States is the freedom of monopoly capital to oppress the working people, the freedom to deceive people with a two-party system and impose its will on its military bloc partners. Such a society creates the soil for wars between countries, because the characteristic of monopoly capital and imperialism is to pursue reactionary policies at home and expansionist and aggressive policies abroad.

It is impossible to maintain peace under the absolute domination of imperialism. However, with the emergence of the new social system—socialism, which replaces the capitalist system, the situation has changed. The socialist system is the most advanced system, which has established new norms in the relations between people, new norms in the relations between nations and states. We are convinced that all of humanity will move towards socialism, communism—towards a harmonious society, which will have no opposing classes: it will be built on the most humane principle—the principle of brotherhood and friendship between people.

After the victory of the working class and the laboring peasants, in any country, there will no longer be any social, national, or other sources of war. When the socialist system, the communist system, dominates the entire world, this situation will arise. Then, all of humanity will become a truly big family of equal nations.

The founders of Marxism-Leninism have long expounded on this issue and scientifically proven it.

The elimination of the capitalist system is the fundamental issue of social development. However, only adventurers would think that the change of social systems can be achieved by provoking wars between countries. Social revolution cannot be exported. It cannot be transplanted by bayonets or rockets. Just as we do not allow anyone to impose another way of life on us that is incompatible with ours, we do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of others, because the way of life is the inalienable right of each country. The question of living under what social conditions is up to the peoples of each country themselves, depending on the internal development and maturity of conditions in that country. Whether this or that country should belong to the socialist or capitalist system is not an issue of international relations, nor is it an issue to be discussed in international forums such as the United Nations, which represents countries with different social systems. This issue should be resolved by the peoples of each country themselves.

It is necessary to consider the concrete realities, the current state of the world. In today's world, there are socialist countries, there are capitalist countries that are members of the American military bloc, and there are countries that do not join any military bloc and pursue a policy of neutrality. Therefore, it is necessary to seek to resolve the main international issues in such a way as to consider the conditions that have already formed, to consider the coexistence of opposing social systems in different countries, and to create conditions under these circumstances to eliminate the possibility of a new world war. A nuclear war will cause unprecedented destruction of cities and factories. It will bring death to hundreds of millions of people. It will destroy the wealth created by generations of labor, and it will harm all countries and all peoples. Its consequences will seriously affect the lives of future generations.

If we allow such a bad fate and do not try to prevent the threat of a world war, then we are committing a crime against this generation and future generations. This is unforgivable, because the defensive power and possibilities given to the working class and all working people by socialism are unimaginable before the appearance of socialist countries.

This is our position on the issue of war and peace.

If capitalist countries were stronger than socialist countries, it would be naive to think that capitalist countries would agree to disarmament. The current situation is that the world socialist system is at least not weaker than the countries gathered by the United States in such aggressive military blocs as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Socialist countries now have unprecedented means to influence capitalist countries, and if necessary, they can even force them to sign disarmament agreements.

If we consider the national liberation movements of many countries, the people's movements for disarmament and world peace, and the peaceful aspirations of a part of the bourgeoisie under current conditions, then in addition to our material strength, which can give a crushing blow to any aggression against socialist countries, there is also the support of the peoples of all countries for our struggle for peace and the cessation of the arms race.

Therefore, when the Soviet government proposed the idea of comprehensive and thorough disarmament, it was based on realistic political, economic, and moral factors. If the peoples of all countries persistently struggle for peace, for comprehensive and thorough disarmament, for the destruction of the means of war under the strictest international supervision, then a world war can be prevented.

Is all this possible? It is possible. No one denies that this is a difficult task, but if a war breaks out, it will be even more burdensome for the people. Therefore, the question is this: will we communists retreat in the face of these difficulties, that is, follow the imperialist forces that advocate continuing the arms race (the arms race, if continued, will lead to war), or will we spare no effort to build a dam to prevent the development of the situation? We are against fatalism, against a passive attitude on the issue of war and peace. One should not underestimate, especially not overestimate, the possibilities of the imperialist forces that advocate war preparations.

As long as imperialist countries exist, as long as monopoly capital, which is addicted to aggression and imperialist wars, dominates in these countries, there will always be the threat of a new war. However, it is precisely against these forces that we can and should oppose a stronger force, and this force is: the determination of the peoples of all countries to stop the war, the desire to decisively crush any imperialist aggression.

This force exists, and this is the socialist countries. In their policies, socialist countries pursue not only the interests of their own people but also the interests of the peoples of all countries, including the working people of capitalist countries. They rely not only on socialist humanitarianism but also on their socialist economy. They have powerful armed forces to defend the national interests of socialist countries.

Our strength lies in the fact that the interests of socialist countries are consistent with the interests of the working people of all countries, including capitalist countries. The working people of capitalist countries stand on the side of the struggle for peace and peaceful coexistence. In addition, it is necessary to add to this that more and more countries have freed themselves from colonial oppression and generally follow the path of non-alignment, that is, the path of peaceful policy, thereby undermining the original rear and reserves of imperialism. Although imperialist countries try to use the neutral line of many countries to achieve their own goals, and neutral countries sometimes sing along with them in this or that tune, this is a temporary phenomenon.

In the issue of war and peace, there can be no neutrality, because all peoples want peace, and therefore all peoples should struggle for peace and against the threat of a new war. The process of demarcating the forces of peace and the forces of war will accelerate and develop. This process will strengthen the forces advocating peace.

The peoples of neutral countries are faced with a historical choice. The imperialist camp tries to drag them into the arms race, making their manpower and resources serve war. Imperialism gives them nothing to eliminate the economic backwardness left by the colonial past. Imperialism has not stopped trying to interfere in their internal affairs to put new colonialist shackles on their heads.

The socialist countries offer them another path—not to participate in the arms race, to develop the economy and culture, and not to allow interference in internal affairs.

What choice will the people make? This does not need to be said. It can be said without doubt that they will choose the path of peace and freedom, not the path of war and new slavery. This choice will greatly strengthen the forces advocating peace.

Due to the growth of socialist and peaceful forces, an unfavorable balance of power for imperialism has formed on the international stage. Now, if we use the rigid formulas of parliament to determine the dividing line and balance of power between socialist and peaceful forces and imperialist forces, this would be a mistake. Ultimately, the balance of power is not determined by the number of countries standing on this side or that side—on the side of socialism or on the side of imperialism.

In determining the balance of power, many factors must be considered—economic potential and military potential, population, and other material and spiritual factors. Here, the use of simple arithmetic will lead to a big mistake.

Even in determining the balance of power within countries with opposing classes, the arithmetic scale cannot provide a clear concept. Because everyone knows that the actual balance of power of this or that party and class in a capitalist country is not determined by the number of seats in parliament.

The constitutions and electoral systems of bourgeois countries give the ruling exploiting class a large number of privileges, not the exploited class, the working people. This can be seen from the example of France, where the Communist Party received 3,888,204 votes and 10 seats in the recent parliamentary elections, while the right-wing bourgeois party, the Union for the Defense of the New Republic, received 3,608,958 votes and 188 seats. Therefore, I say that it is not appropriate to determine the balance of power within this or that bourgeois country to some extent correctly by parliamentary methods.

Then, how is the power maintained in bourgeois countries? Why do proletarian parties, which have the support of the masses, often not have the corresponding number of representatives in parliament? This is because the bourgeoisie uses various electoral tricks, relies on the support of the police, army, courts, and legislative bodies that serve monopoly capital, to suppress democratic and revolutionary progressive movements. This is the dictatorship of monopoly capital.

Therefore, the United Nations must be improved to become an international organization aimed at preventing a new world war. For this, first of all, it is necessary to return to the ideas and principles established at the time of the founding of the United Nations and the United Nations Security Council, that is, to recognize the principle of equality of all countries, especially those that decide whether a new world war will break out or not.

If at the time of the founding of the United Nations, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France were called the five great powers, then now the list of great powers must be greatly expanded. Of course, now it is impossible to include France and Britain in this list while excluding India and Indonesia, not to mention restoring the rights of People's China.

The imperialist colonial countries, acting in the interests of their own group, have undermined some of the foundations laid at the time of the founding of the United Nations. They began to evade the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that the Security Council should resolve the most important issues with the unanimous agreement of the five great powers—the permanent members of the Security Council. When the representatives of the Western countries cannot pass their decisions, they take a detour and bring these issues directly to the United Nations General Assembly.

In this way, the extremely important principle of unanimity of the Security Council, which was established to ensure peace, is being undermined by them. They evade this principle and want to resolve such issues in the United Nations General Assembly with a mechanical majority or a two-thirds majority, hoping that the voting machine will bring them luck. However, one should know that this is not the way out of the predicament. They can only open the valves of conflicts that will lead humanity to the abyss of a world war.

Such a situation will increase the danger that the United Nations itself may push the world to the brink of war or to the abyss of war. It is necessary to strictly adhere to the principle of unanimity of the great powers in the United Nations Charter in resolving the most complex international issues. However, this is only one aspect of the problem. It is also necessary to consider the changed conditions in the world and the new balance of power on the world stage. The representation of the five great powers as permanent members of the Security Council is now obviously insufficient.

Therefore, it is now necessary to establish the organizational structure of the United Nations in such a way that the three types of countries—socialist countries, imperialist countries, and neutral countries—have equal status in resolving international issues that largely determine war and peace.

Whoever clings to the old, does not recognize new things, does not understand that the old things will not help to strengthen peace. In these old things, there is a great danger of war. Whoever does not consider the interests of all three types of countries and wants to use international organizations to serve the interests of one type of country, that is, the imperialist monopoly capitalist countries, is not acting in the interests of strengthening peace.

Therefore, it is necessary to change the structure of the United Nations so that its executive bodies conform to the requirements of life and the principle of equal representation of all three types of countries. Otherwise, this will not be the United Nations but the United Nations of division.

Above, I talked about changing the structure of the Security Council. Of course, this fully applies to the executive bodies of the United Nations, including its Secretary-General. No matter how wide a person's forehead is, he cannot objectively reflect the interests of three types of countries at once.

Naturally, due to the current dominance of the United States, which pursues imperialist colonialist policies, as well as its allies Britain, France, and other monopoly capitalist countries, the United Nations leadership positions are filled by people proposed by them. Who proposed the current Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Hammarskjöld? Everyone knows very well that he is the candidate of the United States. Swedes say that he is the representative of Sweden. Indeed, he was born in Sweden, but in political views, he is a representative of American monopoly capital, and he serves them. Let the Swedes not complain about this. We also have our own Hammarskjöld in the United States, and that is Kerensky. He is a Russian, but whom does he serve? He serves American imperialist capital, and the Russian people have achieved great successes without him for many years.

Of course, each type of country wants to have its own candidate for Secretary-General. This is natural, but it is not realistic. Each type of country that wants to put forward its representative in the executive bodies of the United Nations wants to be dominant, therefore we advocate that no type of country should dominate in the executive bodies of the United Nations—the Secretariat.

Therefore, the most fundamental and fair way to solve the problems of the Secretariat of the United Nations and the Security Council is to implement the principles of equal rights, equal opportunities, and equal representation. The Secretariat of the United Nations should consist of three secretaries.

Someone might object, saying that how can problems be solved then, because then it will be very complicated. In the parliament of a country, especially in the parliament of a bourgeois country, solving problems is also complicated, because there are opposing classes there, each class has its party, its representatives. The ruling class implements its policy, that is, the policy of suppressing other classes. They rely on capital to do this, and capital is a great force. Capital does not participate in the vote, but it can buy, and therefore it expresses its opinion by buying the representatives of other classes. But this is still one country.

Transplanting this parliamentary system to an international organization is unreasonable. The United Nations includes about one hundred countries, and today the world is clearly divided into three country systems. If one starts to suppress this or that type of country, this means taking the path of using force, the path of preparing for war. But one should know that the United Nations was not established for war, but as a tool to ensure peace.

To ensure lasting peace, it is necessary that the interests of no type of country are violated, and that the resolution of international issues takes into account the interests of all three types of countries. Only under these conditions can peace be ensured.

If the United Nations, the Security Council, the General Assembly, and the executive bodies follow a one-sided policy and do not consider the interests of all three types of countries, then in this case, the United Nations itself and its resolutions will not be respected by all countries. In this case, no type of country can demand that other countries must execute the resolutions passed. Such a situation will bring international tension to a peak, to the point where a spark can ignite the flames of a world war.

Since the end of the Second World War, the German problem has not been solved. Large and small countries have joined the United Nations, but the German people have not. The United Nations has admitted Italy, Japan, which was once a militarist country, as well as the fascist countries of Spain and Portugal. Why does the United Nations not have a representative of the German people? Because the peace treaty with Germany has not been signed. The imperialist countries deliberately delay the signing of the treaty and want to use this method to deny the existence of the German Democratic Republic. But this is a foolish policy, because the German Democratic Republic has existed and developed for eleven years. It is necessary to end this phenomenon and sign the peace treaty with Germany. It is necessary to solve this problem and confirm the situation and changes that have occurred after the war, so that the German people can have their own representative in the United Nations on an equal footing.

I repeat, the signing of the peace treaty with Germany is of great significance for easing international tension. Maintaining a state of war with Germany has no other result than poisoning the atmosphere, because all the problems that need to be solved at the time of signing the treaty have been acknowledged in fact.

Obviously, now it is necessary to solve these problems according to objective reality, and it is only necessary to confirm the existing situation of the existence of two Germanies and the inviolability of the borders established after the Second World War.

Any sane politician cannot imagine that the German Democratic Republic will yield or abandon its socialist achievements, or that West Germany today will abandon its political and social system. Therefore, it is necessary to acknowledge the situation that has already formed in fact and record these in the corresponding treaties.

On the issue of West Berlin, we have also repeatedly proposed reasonable solutions.

The German problem is now being used to achieve political purposes and is being utilized in election campaigns in some countries.

The United States is now holding presidential elections. The German problem inevitably appears in the election campaigns: the status of Germany will change or not change, that is, whether to sign a peace treaty with two Germanies or maintain the status quo—this is often a hotly debated topic in the elections. The aggressive groups advocating the preservation of the source of war are trying to use the German problem to promote their "position of strength" policy. And it is dangerous to compete in strength on such issues.

In West Germany, there are also people who use the issue of the peace treaty with Germany. Thus, a situation arises, for example, where people say that in 1960 it is not possible to raise the issue of solving the German problem, it is not possible to reach an agreement on this issue, because the U.S. presidential election hinders this. Someone hints to us that during the election, do not talk about the German problem, and after the election, it will be possible to create conditions for a more realistic attitude towards solving the German problem.

And so on, without end, the extremely important issue of signing the peace treaty with Germany is being delayed, while this issue is urgently needed to be solved, and the postponement of this issue harbors great military dangers.

This issue must be solved. It seems that it must be solved in 1961.

Healthy reason must prevail! It is necessary to sign the treaty, and then in Europe one can breathe in a completely different way.

The steps taken by West Germany against the German Democratic Republic (breaking trade agreements, etc.) are leading to a sharpening of relations, because the German Democratic Republic can also take corresponding steps. All this is not a haringer of improving international relations.

Therefore, it is necessary, as we agreed with the Western countries after the United States sabotaged the Paris Conference, not to take steps that will sharpen relations. We propose to hold a summit meeting after the U.S. presidential election to make new efforts to resolve disputes, to discuss the issue of signing a peace treaty with two Germanies, and on this basis to solve the West Berlin problem, making it a free city.

We adhere to this position. However, if someone imposes another policy on us, then the Western imperialist countries will be responsible for it.

Title: On the Strength of the Socialist Camp and the Struggle for Peace

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 29th.

If the parliamentary method is used to determine the balance of power between socialist countries and imperialist countries, it is very easy to get bogged down in numbers and fail to see the true picture. Otherwise, it would be impossible to explain the following fact: the young socialist state born out of the October Revolution was then the only, weak, and not yet consolidated state in the world, yet it was able to maintain its right to exist. At that time, fourteen countries were against us. The armies of the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Japan, and other countries ravaged our land. The young Soviet state crushed these forces and drove them out.

We must always remember Lenin's teaching: politics is not arithmetic. The Soviet state at that time did not rely solely on its own internal forces, the working class, and the laboring peasants, but also on the international support of the working class and progressive social strata of capitalist countries. This was the situation forty-three years ago.

The situation today is completely different. The Soviet Union has grown into a mighty power. Our economy is continually prospering. We have a strong and well-equipped industry that can produce the necessary quantities of the most modern means of defense. We have a coordinated state apparatus. We have a large army of highly skilled engineering, technical, and scientific personnel who can accomplish any task. We have a first-class modern army equipped with rocket-nuclear weapons. The high level of scientific and technological development of the Soviet Union is world-renowned.

Moreover, we are no longer isolated. In Europe and Asia, there are countries that have embarked on the socialist path and are developing successfully along this path. These new socialist countries have already achieved great successes in state building—socialist construction—as well as in the building of their armed forces.

I have also said that more than a third of the countries have taken a neutral path, which was formerly the rear of imperialism, the supplier of manpower and raw materials. Imperialism has lost these resources and can no longer drag them back to the old path of colonialism.

In determining the balance of power, all these conditions must be considered, and then it will be clear that the forces advocating peace are not weaker but stronger than the forces advocating war. We must clearly realize this in order to realistically assess our strength and not underestimate our ability to maintain a policy of peace.

The Soviet Union was, is, and remains committed to the position of peaceful coexistence with countries of different social systems. However, we do not beg for this peaceful coexistence. We propose this policy on the basis of a sober assessment of the balance of power in the modern world.

All peoples are moving towards socialism and communism. This is the law of social development. Some people will say, since our strength is not less than, and even greater than, that of our enemies, why not use war to resolve disputes? Why not accelerate the development of history? But history is not a horse that can be whipped. Bourgeois politicians claim that the Soviet Union needs peaceful coexistence only as a temporary measure, that we communists are only waiting for the opportunity to wage war and use this war to change the political and social system of their countries. But we say: you are lying. Marxism-Leninism affirms that the class struggle in each country will resolve the balance of power in favor of this or that class. When the strength of the revolutionary proletariat increases, the proletariat will solve the problems of power and the existence of the social system according to its own will, that is, according to the interests of the revolutionary class, and the means of solving this problem will depend on the specific conditions that exist and the methods used by the old ruling class to deal with them.

If it is believed that the resolution of internal political and social problems through war between socialist countries and capitalist countries is a law, this will only benefit the enemies of socialism. The enemies of socialism will use this to oppose Marxist-Leninist doctrine and oppose socialist countries. Then they will say: look, this is what kind of progressive system, what kind of progressive doctrine, if it must be imposed on the peoples of various countries by force.

Socialism is strong because of its vitality, because it corresponds to the most vital interests of the masses of the people. The entire practice of socialist and communist construction has proven this. The dissemination of socialist ideas among the masses does not require violence; this is a truth known even to schoolchildren, but our opponents—the enemies of communism—always try to distort this truth.

What could be more attractive to sympathy for socialism than the example of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries? Everyone knows how backward Tsarist Russia was. Everyone also knows how advanced and strong our country has become in the years of socialist development. Our country has changed from a backward country to a strong, highly developed socialist country. Socialism has created conditions for economic development, cultural prosperity, and scientific advancement that are unimaginable under capitalist conditions. Even our enemies admit this.

The power of example is a great power. The better our cause, the higher the standard of living in socialist countries, the faster people's hearts will turn towards socialism. This is a power that cannot be calculated by arithmetic.

If we talk about the possibility of preventing a new war by socialist countries, then it should be said that this important issue does not depend on the number of countries advocating peace and joining the Western military bloc. Everyone knows that capitalist countries are currently much more numerous than socialist countries. If we start from the need to conduct arithmetic statistics, this will only cause political confusion.

Now, the balance of power allows us to propose and strive for the actual solution of the disarmament issue. The idea of complete and thorough disarmament has now become a powerful weapon for mobilizing the peoples of all countries to struggle for peace and to prevent a new war. For this reason, every person, every country's people, have the duty to defend this idea, to struggle for this idea, to struggle for peace.

The position of the Soviet government on disarmament has been clearly defined and has been explained to the United Nations. This proposal has also been submitted in writing to various countries. The purpose of this proposal, as I said in New York, is to prepare for the conclusion of a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament. We stipulate that in the first stage of disarmament, all means of delivering nuclear weapons to targets should be destroyed, and military bases on the territory of other countries should be withdrawn, military aircraft should be scrapped, etc. We also stipulate the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the cessation of their production and testing, the destruction of all nuclear weapon stocks. In short, we advocate genuine disarmament with international supervision.

British Prime Minister Macmillan said in New York something like this: disarmament talks can last five to ten years.

But you must know that the arms race has not stopped. Now there are three or even four countries that have nuclear weapons. And what will happen in five to ten years? Then many countries will have this weapon.

We are opposed to dragging out such an important issue as disarmament, and we do not agree to deceiving the people with endless negotiations. Although British Prime Minister Macmillan is a Scot, I do not want to use the word "delay" to attack him, because the pronunciation of this word, according to the English understanding, is a bagpipe, a national musical instrument, and what I mean by delay is the dragging out of important issues. Our proposal is completely realistic. We insist on negotiations that can produce beneficial results, and we are opposed to those that will only confuse people's minds and deceive the peoples of various countries.

Some people in the West say that the Soviet Union puts forward its own proposals at the conference for propaganda purposes. We are not afraid of such accusations: after all, we do not shout about war, we demand the creation of conditions for a lasting peace. Such propaganda we will continue. It will not bring harm to the peoples of various countries. But if the Western countries are afraid of propaganda beneficial to peace, then we will not speak.

We have a comprehensive disarmament proposal, let the Western countries put forward their proposals. We sit down and discuss each item in a practical and realistic manner, what can be accepted and what cannot be accepted.

I would like to add that the responsibility for ensuring peace, that is, the responsibility for reaching a disarmament agreement and destroying weapons, should not be placed solely on the countries that possess nuclear weapons. This is incorrect and dangerous.

There are no peoples who do not care about solving the disarmament issue. If these or those countries that do not have sufficiently strong armies and underdeveloped industries are excluded from promoting the solution of the disarmament issue, then they will not reduce but increase the threat of a catastrophic nuclear war that will bring military disaster to themselves, their own people, and the whole world.

All the peoples of the countries, whether large or small, all the countries, whether strong or weak, in the current struggle for the solution of the disarmament and destruction of weapons issue, should show the same concern and tenacity as they did in the struggle for freedom and independence.

Recently, British Prime Minister Macmillan spoke at the Conservative Party conference. He was satisfied with his attendance at the United Nations General Assembly, as he put it, this was an "outstanding meeting," with representatives from almost a hundred countries attending. In his speech, he acknowledged that humanity is faced with such a choice—whether to resolve disputes by the use of force or by negotiation. Macmillan advocated negotiating on disputes to ease tensions.

The Soviet government agrees with this position, and we have not once but many times proven that the policy of peaceful coexistence is not a tactical maneuver but the great line of Soviet foreign policy left to us by Lenin. We stood on this position in the past, and we will stand on this position in the future!

However, for Macmillan's hope to ease tensions not to remain just a noble wish, Western countries need to do concrete things. Macmillan acknowledged that in the disarmament issue, discussions "have not yet reached the stage of taking action." This is a meaningful admission. If the British government really, as Macmillan said, wants "disarmament and supervision to proceed simultaneously, so that each stage has disarmament and supervision," then we agree to do so.

The Soviet government has always and now advocates genuine disarmament, and has proven this with not one but many unilateral reductions in its own armed forces. If Britain and its allies—the United States, France, and other countries—can show this genuine desire for disarmament, then the main and most important obstacle to reaching an agreement on disarmament will be removed, and the road to disarmament will be smooth.

Macmillan, if all this is for the solution of the disarmament issue, then let us finally turn to concrete actions, and do not drag out the solution of this most urgent issue indefinitely.

If this is your opinion and the opinion of your allies, then please present your amendments to our proposal, or present your comprehensive proposal, if you do not like our proposal just because it is proposed by the Soviet Union. For us, who proposes it is not important, for us, reaching a disarmament agreement is meaningful, because this can free mankind from the threat of a tragic world war. For us, the main thing is disarmament, not who first proposes this or that proposal on this issue. Before leaving New York, I made a special speech on the disarmament issue at the fifteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Our proposal has been published in the newspapers and made public.

We also submitted a draft of the "Basic Provisions of the Treaty on Complete and Thorough Disarmament" to the United Nations, which also includes a system of clauses on strict and detailed international supervision and investigation of the implementation of the treaty provisions.

The West likes to say: show your cards. We are not gambling with disarmament, but if they like it that way, we have shown our cards.

Now it is the turn of the Western countries. Indeed, after we left New York, these countries submitted some new proposals for discussion at the conference. One of them is the proposal of the United States, Britain, and Italy, which, according to the drafters of the proposal, includes the principles for solving the disarmament issue. Another proposal is from Britain, which provides for the establishment of an expert committee to study—you guess what—supervision issues!

The speaker Macmillan advocated concreteness in discussing the disarmament issue. But this concreteness is actually not there. You have to understand these people. But life will teach them, life will also teach Macmillan and the likes of Macmillan. We are not in a hurry now. We tell them: if you, gentlemen, want to try the strength and endurance of socialist countries again, we will give you a taste of it as usual. Today we are strong, and tomorrow we will be even stronger, you, gentlemen, will not wait for the moment of weakness to laugh at us. We—the Soviet workers, peasants, our scientists—will make you sad day by day, year by year, because of the growth and strengthening of the power of socialism, the growth of the power of communism.

This is a bit off from the speech I prepared, but I think it will not be harmful to those who still do not want to listen to the voice of reason. The discussion on the disarmament issue (including supervision) has been going on for fifteen years, it seems that fifteen years is not enough.

The two proposals from Western countries show that they are still not ready to seriously address the solution of the disarmament issue, and they continue to use the disarmament talks, including the talks at this session of the General Assembly, to cover up the policy of the arms race. You can judge for yourselves, since the above-mentioned proposal on the principles of disarmament does not mention a single word about the withdrawal of military bases on the territory of other countries, nor a single word about when and over what period of time to carry out this or that disarmament measure, how can it be evaluated otherwise? In essence, this is the proposal advocated by President Eisenhower at the General Assembly, which provides for the supervision of armaments, rather than the supervised disarmament that the Soviet Union has insisted on for many years.

The above-mentioned proposals of Western countries are not a good omen for the future.

If Western countries do not want to move forward on the path of complete and thorough disarmament, then we have the right to conclude that they are not yet ready for disarmament, but they do not want to openly tell their own people this, because the peoples of Western countries—the peoples of the United States, Britain, the peoples of the world—all demand disarmament. The Soviet Union will continue to consistently and tenaciously fight for disarmament, for lasting peace, and for the security of the peoples of all countries.

I will say it again, we advocate genuine disarmament, and everyone who holds this position can find a common language with us.

The peoples of all countries have great expectations for the United Nations, hoping that the United Nations can solve the unresolved international problems and strive to achieve a situation where the peace of the whole world can be guaranteed.

But I must say, if the situation continues as it is now, then the United Nations will not achieve significant results. The United Nations' cart has already created very deep ruts, and it is moving along these ruts and will find it very difficult to get out of them.

If you look at the behavior of many representatives of countries at the General Assembly, you can conclude that the United Nations does not meet the expectations of the peoples of the countries.

The conference hall is often almost empty. In many country representatives' seats, there are "on-duty" representatives. They are not actually participating in the General Assembly, but are only there to vote if necessary. Such a representative of the national delegation is very similar to a machine operator and an automatic machine that controls actions according to procedures. He does not need to think, does not need to be tense, but only needs one thing—to vote "yes" or "no" on this or that issue. It is completely impossible to influence the psychology of such a person, he strictly follows the instructions given in advance.

This makes us even more convinced of the correctness of our appeal to the heads of governments of the member countries of the United Nations, this appeal is: to take the important international problems facing the world very seriously—the problem of eliminating the colonial system, the problem of restoring the legitimate rights of China, the problem of American aggression, and other problems, and mainly the most important international problem—the disarmament issue, the guarantee of world peace first of all depends on the solution of this issue.

Undoubtedly, it is impossible to solve all these problems through one session of the General Assembly. Therefore, if you really want to guarantee lasting peace, it is necessary for the heads of states or governments to participate in the actual work of the General Assembly.

I have already said in New York that it seems that the disarmament issue will not be solved at this session. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to convene a special session on this issue. We believe that such a session can be held in March or April next year. If the heads of states or governments participating in this session can solve the issue of complete and thorough disarmament in principle, under strict international supervision, then it seems that thereafter it will be necessary to work in a more limited circle. And the heads of states or governments can give instructions to the work of the fifteen-nation committee we propose to establish.

But I will say it again, without the participation of the heads of states or governments, the fundamental and basic issues of disarmament cannot be solved, because too much mistrust has formed between the countries, and the governments' disagreements on solving this issue are too great. It is necessary to show a healthy and brave attitude, to show the wisdom of the state, so that the United Nations' cart can move along the correct path. Who can do this? Only those who are fully trusted by their own people and their own government can do this.

Three, give freedom and independence to the colonial peoples!

Comrades! The Soviet Union at the fifteenth session of the General Assembly firmly proposed the issue of completely and immediately eliminating the savage and disgusting legacy of colonialism that has been left over from many centuries. The Soviet Union is faithful to the policy of supporting the struggle for national independence of the oppressed peoples, and calls on the United Nations to issue a call to defend the cause of the liberation of the colonies.

Many delegations in the United Nations welcome and support the declaration on granting independence to colonial countries and peoples, and this declaration has received the enthusiastic support of all freedom-loving peoples.

The colonialist countries and their aggressive military bloc allies do not hesitate to use any means to obstruct the struggle for independence and freedom of the colonial peoples. Therefore, the discussion on the issue of granting independence to colonial countries at the General Assembly meeting was conducted in sharp struggle.

The peoples who love freedom have achieved great success. The Assembly recognized that the issue of eliminating colonialism raised by the Soviet Union is an extremely important issue, and this issue was listed as an item for discussion at the plenary session of the Assembly. The recognition of the importance of this issue is a great spiritual satisfaction for the Soviet Union and a great victory for the forces fighting against colonialism.

A situation has arisen at the Assembly where even the imperialist, colonialist countries had to agree to discuss this issue at the plenary session. To be honest, before going to New York, when our government discussed the issues of the General Assembly, we had already considered the possibility that the United States would vote with the Soviet Union to discuss this issue at the plenary session of the Assembly.

When the agenda of the Assembly was discussed, the first to speak against the Soviet proposal was the British representative. He tried to prove that the colonialists are only concerned with promoting the progress and liberation of the colonies. The British representative almost raised his hand to heaven, asking God to witness, and this God had once blessed the "civilizing" mission of the colonialists. But who does not know that this activity is manifested as the enslavement of the people and the extermination of the natives.

When you talk about the "civilization" that colonialism brings to the colonies, the blood in your veins will freeze. In the half-century of Belgian rule, the population of the Congo has almost halved—many people died in the suppression, expeditions, hunger, and disease. The Congo is not the only exception. In the sixty years of French rule, the population of Madagascar has decreased by more than half. The infant mortality rate in the colonies has reached a horrifying scale. For example, in Nigeria, more than half of the children die before they reach the age of six. In the colonies, the working day is the longest, the wages are the lowest, the life span is the shortest, and the population mortality rate is the highest.

And this is happening in our time, in the time of progress and great scientific discoveries, in this time when people have split the atom, successfully conquered space, and rapidly expanded the control over the forces of nature. In this time, the representatives of the countries that aspire to the championship of cultural development boast of their "civilization," and talk about the "benefits" of colonialism. When you hear about these "benefits," you will think that they will soon ask the General Assembly to thank them for their "civilized," that is, colonialist, policy of enslavement.

But the representatives of the peoples who have broken free from colonialist slavery say something else. The representatives of India, Indonesia, Ghana, Guinea, Ceylon, Liberia, Morocco, Nigeria, and many other countries spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, and they unanimously demanded that this issue be discussed at the plenary session of the Assembly, insisting that the colonialist system must be eliminated.

The American representative sat there, silent, as if he were not present. But it is not possible to remain silent forever, they must either vote in favor of the Soviet proposal to discuss this issue at the plenary session of the Assembly, or support their allies—the colonialists. Of course, American imperialists are themselves actually colonialists, they impose slavery treaties on the peoples of many countries and exploit them. This policy is well known to the peoples of Latin America and other countries.

When the heated debate on this issue began and almost all the speakers expressed their support for the Soviet proposal, the American representative finally spoke. I regret that he did not end his speech. The American representative slandered the socialist countries, which provoked strong protests from the representatives of these countries. Romanian comrade Minscinski went to the podium to give the Americans the deserved rebuttal. He demanded that the chairman, Bolan, not allow insults. Then a very ridiculous scene occurred. The chairman was too zealous, he did not estimate that his main tool—the gavel—would not be obedient, he used it to hit the table too hard, and the gavel was broken into pieces. After the chairman lost the symbol of his power contained in the gavel, he hurriedly announced the adjournment of the meeting.

Unfortunately, the meeting ended. I think the American representative might have ended his speech by supporting the colonialist countries. But after a night, obviously a night spent in thought, the American concluded that it was necessary to choose the lesser evil. Obviously, directly, openly supporting the British, Spanish, Portuguese, and French colonialists would mean exposing themselves. So the Americans decided to be more clever, support the proposal of the Soviet and anti-colonialist countries. The British representative who spoke again also had to pretend that he welcomed the discussion of this issue at the plenary session.

A unanimous decision was made to discuss this issue at the plenary session of the General Assembly, which is a great victory for the forces fighting to eliminate the colonialist system.

But I want to remind you: if someone takes the votes of the imperialist countries for real, that would be too naive. It can be said that the unanimous vote was obtained from the colonialists under the pressure of the majority. The representatives of the imperialist countries decided to support the proposal to discuss this issue at the plenary session, but this is not a substantive solution. There has never been and will never be a substantive agreement with the colonialists on this issue.

We advocate the complete and immediate elimination of the shameful colonialist system, the condemnation of past and present colonialism, and the prevention of the colonialist system from appearing in any form in any place in the future.

The imperialists try to "beautify" their colonialist policy, they do not even object to talking about providing assistance to the countries that have broken free from colonial oppression. But what is this "assistance"? As the American president said in his speech at the General Assembly, there are no constructive proposals in this speech. The president said that the United States is willing to provide one hundred million dollars for the United Nations' plan as assistance to the newly independent African countries. But if this money is distributed according to the population of the newly independent African countries, then each person would get fifty-five cents. This money is not even enough for a leisurely stroll, and in the United States, you cannot even buy two packs of cigarettes with it.

The imperialists have plundered and will continue to plunder the African countries, and now they are giving out small favors. They take one dollar and give out one cent. They give small favors just like a rich peasant gives five kopecks to a hired laborer who has been exploited mercilessly by him for a whole year, or like a capitalist gives a barrel of vodka to the entire enterprise.

The imperialists may advocate the necessity of recognizing the liberation of the colonial peoples in words, but they are more willing to propose plans to delay the granting of freedom and independence to the colonial peoples. They use to cover up: the cadres have not been trained, the people have not been educated, there is no preparation for self-determination, and other theories of slave traders.

Listen, a young representative of an African country responded so well to the colonialists' speculation. He said:

Believe me, people will walk, break the chains on their bodies!

All the peoples who truly stand on the position of condemning colonialism and liberating the colonial peoples should resolutely strive for the immediate and complete cessation of colonialist slavery, and loudly condemn the colonialists, expose their plots, no matter how they are disguised.

Because the colonialists are against giving independence to the colonial peoples, it is natural that the oppressed peoples intensify their struggle for their own liberation. And they are gaining their freedom! There is no doubt that the peoples who love freedom will extend their helping hand to those who are fighting against the colonialists and the executioners of people's freedom. Nothing can prevent the collapse of the colonialist system, which is destined by history to perish. The death knell of colonialism has already sounded, and the colonial peoples will definitely gain their freedom!

Comrades! The Algerian issue is an important part of the issue of eliminating the colonialist system, but this issue will be discussed as a separate item on the agenda of the Assembly.

For more than six years, the Algerian people have been waging a heroic war to free themselves from foreign oppression. The French colonialists tried to suppress the Algerians' desire for freedom and independence with fire and sword. But they could not, and still cannot, destroy the will of the people who are fighting for their freedom. The noble struggle of the sons and daughters of Algeria has gained more and more international recognition and support. In France itself, the movement against the colonialist war in Algeria, led by true French patriots, is expanding.

The Algerian issue has been discussed many times at the Assembly, but each time the colonialists have made the discussion result in a resolution that is of little significance and of no practical help to the Algerian people. With the support of their allies, especially the United States and Britain, the French colonialists have appeared in the discussion of this issue almost as victors. This time, the struggle at the Assembly will be much sharper, and it will be more difficult for the colonialists to obtain another meaningless resolution.

What is the position of the Soviet Union on the Algerian issue? Our position is very clear. We have always advocated the self-determination of the peoples of all countries, the right of each country's people to determine their own social and political structure. This is also the case for Algeria.

We have not once but many times spoken to the French representative about our views on this issue. I remember the conversation with the former French Prime Minister Mollet and Foreign Minister Pineau when they visited the Soviet Union in May 1956. At that time, we told the French that if you do not consider the lessons learned in Vietnam, then you will undoubtedly not get out of the dead end in Algeria. The only way out for you is to recognize the right of self-determination of the Algerian people. Only on this basis can the Algerian issue be solved.

Mollet and Pineau said that France could not give up Algeria, they said that there are two million French people living there. Therefore, according to their logic, this alone is enough to believe that Algeria should be France's. We replied to the leaders of the then French government that you talk about two million French people in Algeria, but in fact, there are not so many, but you cannot ignore the nine million Algerians.

We tried to remind our interlocutors to correctly understand this issue. Mollet and Pineau insisted that losing Algeria would be detrimental to France's dignity. We proved to them that France's dignity is not manifested in colonialist plunder, not in the suppression of the peoples of other countries. But it seems that the defenders of colonialism do not want to consider reality, because they continue to pursue a policy that has long been bankrupt.

If the French colonialists in the future still do not give up their attempts to use force to make Algeria continue to be their colony, then they will lose it due to the inevitable military defeat.

Soon after General de Gaulle came to power through a military coup, he made a statement that France recognizes the right of self-determination of Algeria. But later, under the pressure of extreme reactionary colonialist forces, he retreated and began to talk about self-determination, but here it is such a "self-determination" that the outcome is predetermined: Algeria should remain within the borders of France. The most shameless French colonialists demand integration, that is, the complete annexation of Algeria, wanting to eliminate the Algerian Algeria of the Algerians and turn it into a province of France in North Africa.

The Soviet and socialist countries' peoples, in accordance with Lenin's teachings, resolutely adhere to the principle that every nation should have the right of self-determination and the right to organize the state according to its own will. Therefore, our sympathy and support are on the side of the Algerian people who are waging a just war for liberation from colonialist oppression.

There are various kinds of wars. We are against the plundering, imperialist war that the French colonialists are now waging in Algeria. But we recognize and support the just wars of the peoples of various countries for their own liberation. Since the colonialists themselves do not retreat from the colonies, the enslaved peoples of the countries rise up and fight to drive the colonialists out of their own countries. If necessary, they will not hesitate to take up arms to fight for their freedom and independence. The Algerian patriots are now waging such a struggle, and we wish them success.

We have already talked about the fact that the Soviet Union recognizes the Algerian Republic's provisional government in fact, and now we want to reiterate our words. This government has gained the recognition of the whole world, including France. The French government has not once but many times contacted and negotiated with the Algerian Republic's government. Now, everywhere, the Algerian Republic's government is regarded as the representative of the Algerian people and the leader of the Algerian people in their struggle for national freedom and independence.

The Assembly also passed a decision to discuss the issue of the Congo at the plenary session. The Soviet delegation, the delegations of other socialist countries, and many representatives of Asian and African countries in the Assembly correctly evaluated the situation that has arisen in the Congo and the shameful role played by the United Nations Secretary-General there.

The shame that the United Nations has suffered due to the policy of the United Nations Secretariat under the leadership of Secretary-General Hammarskjöld in the Congo is indelible. Due to the activities of Mr. Hammarskjöld and his representatives, the legitimate parliament elected by the Congolese people and the government established by the parliament according to the constitution, with Mr. Lumumba as its head, were dissolved and paralyzed. Who are the representatives that Mr. Hammarskjöld sent to the Congo? These are Mr. Cordier and Mr. Bunche. These two people are Americans. But this is not surprising, because Mr. Hammarskjöld himself is also a servant of American monopoly capital. Therefore, it is not accidental that Secretary of State Herter handed a check for five hundred million dollars to Mr. Hammarskjöld to use at will in the Congo to carry out dirty deals and, in a hidden form, restore the order that existed there during the time of Belgian colonialism.

The development of events is tragic for the Congolese people, but it has torn off the masks of the imperialist-colonialists and those who serve them, and it has torn off the mask of the United Nations Secretary-General. Now everyone can see that he is implementing the policy of reactionary colonialists, representing the interests of the imperialist countries led by the United States. The events in the Congo will promote the maturity of the colonial peoples and help them better understand who their friends and who their enemies are.

And the policy of the colonialists will suffer bankruptcy, this is undoubted. The day will come when the Congo Republic will stand firmly and guarantee its independence. The selfless struggle of the Congolese people that continues is a guarantee that they will carry on this struggle to victory. The socialist countries and all the peoples who love freedom stand on the side of the colonial peoples who are struggling, on the side of the Congolese people who are struggling.

Comrades! During the time our delegation traveled on the "Baltic Sea" to the American coast and during our entire stay in New York, we always felt the concern and support of the Soviet people, our great Soviet homeland.

We received thousands of letters and telegrams from all corners of the country, these are letters from enterprises, collective farms, scientific institutions, party organizations, Soviet institutions, trade unions, and the Komsomol, letters from many workers, Soviet peasants, and intellectuals. In these letters, there are the most sincere wishes for the success of the work of the Soviet delegation, and they express their belief that our delegation will do everything possible to strengthen the confidence of the peoples of all countries in the General Assembly, to make them believe that it is possible to ease international tensions and free mankind from the arms race and the shameful slavery of colonialism.

The Soviet people expressed their complete support for the position of the Soviet government, and showed deep concern for the solution of the most important international issues to benefit the peoples who yearn for peace, tranquility, and the happiness of themselves and their descendants.

All these sincere letters gave us greater confidence and inspired us to fight for the strengthening of world peace and the solution of the most urgent and important issues of the modern world.

Please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks on behalf of our Party Central Committee, on behalf of the Soviet government, and in my personal capacity to the labor collectives and all the Soviet people for their good wishes.

Our delegation also received thousands of letters and telegrams from abroad, wishing our work for peace to be successful. Many letters and telegrams were sent by Americans, who also expressed their hope that there would be better mutual understanding between our peoples and that world peace would be strengthened.

Please allow me to thank all our foreign friends for their warm wishes and for their support for the work of our delegation to the fifteenth session of the General Assembly.

I would also like to express my gratitude to the entire crew of the "Baltic Sea" turbine electric ship, led by Captain Mayorov, and to the entire crew of the "Tu-114" aircraft, including Captain Vitkovsky, for their excellent work and for carrying out their duties excellently. We traveled to New York on the "Baltic Sea" across the Atlantic, and the "Tu-114" aircraft brought us back to our dear Moscow in ten hours.

We traveled on the "Baltic Sea" for ten days and nights, while the "Tu-114" aircraft took us back to Moscow from New York in just ten hours, this is technology! Different levels, different possibilities!

How our delegation performed its task at the United Nations General Assembly will be judged by the Soviet people. We tried to honorably and worthily represent the interests of the Soviet Union. We did not waste our time, because we clearly knew that going to New York was not to visit one's mother-in-law to eat pancakes, but to work. Besides, the American government did not prepare to welcome us with bread and salt, as you know from the newspapers. But we were not embarrassed by this, we did our duty with the high sense of responsibility and conscience of communists—the defenders of world peace.

Comrades, I would like to talk about my impressions of New York City. This is a very large city. Gorky called it the city of the yellow devil. But more than fifty years have passed since Gorky was there, and since then, New York has become even more disgusting. It manifests the deformity and decadence of capitalism. The people living there are doomed to suffer forever, locked in a stone bag. Quite high buildings are often demolished, and new skyscrapers are built in their place. The city seems to be crawling upwards.

There are some streets below with trees. But these trees do not develop, they wither, and it seems that they are about to die. New trees are planted to replace them, but those trees will also die soon.

It is particularly pitiful to see children who have lost the joys of childhood, because they not only do not have the opportunity to run around in the fresh air that every living being must have, but they do not even have the opportunity to walk in the fresh air. The streets are almost filled with a large number of cars. And everyone knows that cars run on gasoline, so the entire air is polluted. In short, in this respect, New York is a terrible city.

The people responsible for the direction of the city's development are unable to stop the further deformity of the city, because neither the state nor the political activists can decide how the city should develop, this is the business of every private owner, they own their own land. If he wants to demolish a 15-20 story building and build a 40-60 story or even a 100-story building in a busy place, he can demolish the old buildings and build new ones.

In this city of the yellow devil, the main thing is not the person, but the dollar. Everyone wants to know how to get more income, more dollars. The center of attention there is not the life of the person, but profit and the pursuit of capital.

The capitalist direction of urban development pays little attention to the needs of people's lives. I cannot help but proudly compare this situation with ours, the socialist urban development. Here, the planning and construction of cities are subordinate to the person, subordinate to the care for the person and the creation of various conveniences.

Returning to the homeland, returning to Moscow, I am simply enjoying the fresh air that our people breathe. Our capital is a beautiful city, especially now, when it is being rebuilt and new districts are being built. Moscow is becoming an even more beautiful city, with well-equipped houses, wide streets, squares, tree-lined courtyards, playgrounds for children, pools, and countless trees. Comrades, I have already said that the current state of the United Nations is disappointing the expectations of the peoples of the countries for avoiding the threat of war and avoiding the arms race. But we believe that healthy thoughts will prevail, truth will prevail, and good seeds will grow into sturdy seedlings. The governments under the pressure of the people will understand the necessity of peaceful coexistence of all countries and the need to realize complete and thorough disarmament under strict international supervision, and such a moment will come, and it will not be far away. We will do everything possible on our part to reorganize the United Nations according to the requirements of the times, making it a truly universal and universal tool for peace.

It must be admitted that the international situation is still tense. The American aggression group has not given up its aggressive actions and has not given up its provocative flights of aircraft over the territory of other countries, first of all over the territory of the Soviet Union. You know, we have submitted the issue of American aggression against the Soviet Union to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. This issue has been included in the agenda.

Not long ago, there was news in the newspapers that the Pentagon decided to dispatch submarines equipped with rockets and nuclear weapons to patrol near the Soviet coast.

The land and sea military leaders of the United States cannot be unaware that our country also has submarines equipped with rocket atomic engines. If we also take this path, if our submarines also patrol near the American coast, what will happen?

This is the criminal "policy of the brink of war" announced by Dulles, and his followers are pursuing this policy. This is the path of "cold war," which can turn into a hot war.

Recently, our relations with the United States have deteriorated, and this is not due to our fault.

But no matter how cold our relations with the United States are now, we will continue to implement Lenin's policy of peaceful coexistence. We believe that the time will come when the relations between our two countries, our two peoples, our two governments will improve.

But to make this time come sooner, to break the Pentagon and the American aggression group's habit of provoking the Soviet Union, we must make our economy develop at high speed, make our science reach the required level, and make our army have the most modern weapons.

We must do everything possible to increase labor productivity, ensure the development of the economy, science, and culture, and improve the living standards of the people, so that in the practice of peaceful competition with capitalism, we can demonstrate the great superiority of socialism and the great power of Marxist-Leninist doctrine.

The Central Statistical Bureau recently published a report on the implementation of the national economic plan for the first nine months of this year, which convincingly shows how smoothly our domestic affairs are going. Such results bring joy to the hearts of the Soviet people—tireless builders of communism—and inspire our foreign friends.

The rapidly developing socialist industry year after year greatly overfulfills the plan tasks. This year, the increase in industrial products will exceed 1.4 billion rubles. It should be said that only a few years ago, before the reorganization of industrial management, the annual increase in industrial products was about 1 billion rubles.

Perhaps you still remember that in early 1946, when the Party formulated the post-war economic development plan of our country, it set the task of doubling industrial products, and the annual production of steel and oil to reach 60 million tons each. It was estimated that it would take fifteen years, or even more, to complete the planned plan.

How did the Soviet people complete this task? Fifteen years have passed, the production of industrial products in our country has not increased by two times, but by five times. Now, the Soviet Union produces 65 million tons of steel and 145 million tons of oil per year. Our agriculture is developing just as smoothly, and cultural construction is also proceeding smoothly.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government attach particular importance to the training of qualified cadres. The achievements of our country in the training of cadres have shocked the world. The enemies of socialism even go so far as to fabricate absurd myths. They say that the more engineers, scientists, doctors, and teachers there are in the Soviet Union, the more difficulties we will encounter in our progress. Well! Let us bravely face these "difficulties."

Allow me to list some very convincing materials: in 1926, when the work of restoring our economy to the pre-revolutionary level was completed, the Soviet Union had 168,000 students in institutions of higher learning and only 2.5 million intellectual workers. Last year, our country had about 2.2 million university students, an increase of twelve times, and the number of intellectual workers now exceeds 20 million, an increase of seven times. Among them, the number of engineers, technicians, and agronomists has increased by seventeen times, and the number of scientific workers has increased by twenty-two times.

Among the people engaged in physical labor, the number of those who have received secondary and higher education has greatly increased. Before the revolution, there were no people who had received secondary education among the workers and peasants, and there were no people who had received higher education, but now, according to the latest survey figures, among the Soviet citizens engaged in physical labor, 32% have received secondary and higher education, these people account for 39% among the workers and 21% among the collective farmers.

Thus, in the years of the Soviet government, our country has grown a team of more than 20 million intellectual workers—real people's intellectuals who are closely connected with the workers and peasants. It is particularly noteworthy that nearly one-third of the Soviet physical laborers, including two-fifths of the workers and more than one-fifth of the collective farm members, have secondary and even higher education.

All this convincingly shows that we have achieved very obvious results in gradually eliminating the fundamental differences between physical labor and mental labor.

There are many other such convincing examples that can be listed to prove the excellent achievements of our motherland, which is confidently moving towards the great goal of communism.

Dear comrades! In just over two weeks, I and you will celebrate the forty-third anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution—the greatest revolution in human history.

We are happy and joyful to see that the Soviet people—the great builders of the new world, that is, the communist world—under the leadership of their beloved Communist Party have achieved great achievements.

We are faithful to the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and move forward bravely. There is no force in the world that can stop the peoples of all countries from moving towards the goal of light.

Long live our Leninist Communist Party—the inspirer and organizer of communist construction!

Long live our socialist homeland—the glory and pride of all progressive humanity!

Long live the mighty camp of socialist countries!

Long live lasting world peace!

    关于苏联出席联合国大会代表团的工作
    赫鲁晓夫在莫斯科群众大会上的讲话
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科20日电：赫鲁晓夫1960年10月20日在莫斯科劳动人民群众大会上发表了关于苏联出席联合国大会代表团工作的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的莫斯科同志们！
    在我们伟大的祖国的其他城乡各地收听我的讲话广播的亲爱的同志和朋友们！
    我想同大家谈谈我们参加联合国大会第十五届会议的感想，并根据惯例汇报在那里所做的工作。
    如果有人问，到纽约去参加这次会议是否值得，那么可以毫无保留地说，不仅值得，而且是必须前去的。现在全世界都承认，本届大会具有特别重要的意义。
    苏联政府认为，这次大会必须讨论当代最迫切的、切身重要的问题。我们认为，负最高责任的国家活动家应当参加联合国大会会议。美国政府和它的盟国企图破坏这个主张，但是，大家知道，他们毫无所得。
    我们的立场在所有社会主义国家中受到最热烈的支持，得到世界许多国家政府的广泛响应和谅解。为了免于孤立，美国总统、英国、加拿大、澳大利亚的总理和他们的某些其他同盟者也被迫在半途改变主意，赶来参加会议。
    正如世界舆论公正地指出的那样，联合国大会第十五届会议是现代史上最有代表性的一次国际会议。有三十多个国家的国家首脑、政府首脑和主要的国务活动家在那里进行了会晤。
    提交这次会议讨论的有许多极重要的国际问题。苏联代表团提议讨论这样一些迫切问题：全面彻底裁军问题、消除殖民主义和给予所有人民和国家独立的问题、美国对其他国家的侵略活动问题、必须改变联合国执行机构的结构的问题。包括到会议议程中去的还有恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利问题、阿尔及利亚问题等许多问题。
    由国家领导人所率领的社会主义国家代表团的参加会议，以及许多其他联合国会员国国家的国家首脑和政府首脑的参加会议，带来了意义重大的结果。
    在大会厅中，大家以很大的注意和兴趣听取了当代许多卓越的国务活动家的发言。社会主义阵营国家代表团团长的发言给人留下了深刻的印象，他们是：捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国总统诺沃提尼同志、波兰代表团团长哥穆尔卡同志、罗马尼亚代表团团长乔治乌—德治同志、匈牙利代表团团长卡达尔同志、保加利亚代表团团长日夫科夫同志、阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡同志。乌克兰代表团团长波德戈尔内同志和白俄罗斯代表团团长马祖罗夫同志也在会上发了言。
    社会主义国家代表团团长的发言响彻了整个世界，这是给人民带来幸福、给世界带来繁荣的一个新的、正义的世界的声音。他们的发言同时也是对帝国主义、殖民主义世界的严厉谴责，因为这个世界死抱住一切过时的、被历史所摒弃的事物，给和平和各国人民的安全造成威胁。
    加纳总统恩克鲁玛、几内亚总统杜尔、印度尼西亚总统苏加诺、印度总理尼赫鲁、阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔、柬埔寨国家首脑西哈努克和其他独立国家代表的发言，是对争取和平、争取消除为人民所痛恨的殖民主义制度的斗争的重要贡献。古巴人民英雄的儿子、古巴总理卡斯特罗的鲜明的发言给人留下了深刻的印象。其他国务活动家在发言中也提出了不少建设性的建议。
    帝国主义势力的代表、殖民主义的保卫者经常以公开的形式，更经常的是用伪装的形式企图维持和保卫住自己的阵地。由于这样，正像大家已经知道的那样，会上常常掀起这个国际组织成立以来从来没有过的斗争。
    从我们进行了许多会晤、就一系列切身重要的国际问题同不同国家的国务活动家交换了意见这点来看，我们此行是有好处的。所有这一切促使各国达成更好的互相谅解并建立更紧密的关系。
    联合国成立多年以来，积累了许多需要坚决予以修改以便使其适应于目前这种世界力量配置状况的东西。可以说，联大第十五届会议第一阶段工作中的主要路线，是新的、进步的事物同旧的、过时的、阻挠新事物发展和成长的事物的斗争。
    亲爱的同志们，现在请让我比较详细地谈谈目前国际局势的主要之点和我们代表团在联合国大会第十五届会议上的活动。
    一、联合国成立后世界发生的变化
    同志们！许多人认为联合国大会第十五届会议是一次特别的会议，这是完全正确的。会上对联合国成立以来所做的工作作了某些总结。
    会上正确地指出，最近十五年来世界上发生了重大的政治和社会性质的变化。
    这些变化首先是：强大的社会主义国家阵营成长起来了。现在有十亿多人在社会主义的旗帜下生活和劳动着。世界社会主义体系的产生，对整个人类的发展、对人类的命运具有决定性的意义。
    第二次世界大战后，在联合国创建期间，资本主义制度在世界上占统治地位，殖民主义制度还很稳固。战后十五年来发生了重大的社会演变。欧洲和亚洲产生了一系列社会主义国家。它们不仅产生了，而且迅速地巩固起来了，捍卫住自己的革命成果，并且在发展经济和提高人民群众福利、在发展科学文化各方面显示出对资本主义制度的优越性。
    在发展生产的速度方面、在探索宇宙方面、在和平利用原子能方面走在前面的正是社会主义国家。
    有人指责我们共产党人是暴力者，说我们只善于组织人们去夺取政权，说我们蹂躏个性自由，但却不善于建设、不善于组织工业和农业。我们的敌人说，我们不向前推动科学和文化。他们曾经说，革命是破坏的，而不是建设的。现在这些声音到哪里去了，这些可怜的预言家到哪里去了？夹起尾巴默不作声了！不默不作声又怎么办呢！
    现在全世界都很清楚，真正的自由、国民经济的高速度发展和文化的高涨是在人民取得了胜利的地方，在组织社会方面的新因素占上风的地方，也就是在社会主义取得胜利的地方。在社会主义的条件下，自由的人民在人类伟大的思想家马克思、恩格斯、列宁创造的学说的基础上建设新的生活。这种学说的果实现在大家都看到了，也许，政治上的盲人除外。
    殖民主义世界在这段时期中也发生了重大的变化。殖民主义帝国正在崩溃。可以说，殖民主义帝国已经崩溃，现在正在裂成碎片。在亚洲，印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰等国已经摆脱了殖民压迫。非洲人民的解放事业正在蓬勃发展。受尽苦难的非洲人民终于在获得人的权利。
    世界上发生的所有这些伟大的变化是不能不加以考虑的。第二次世界大战后成立联合国时，世界的政局不是目前这样的，当时的政局决定了这个国际组织的结构。
    在那些年间，美国支配着整个世界。当时这个国家是经济上最富最强的国家，看来，正是这点事先决定了联合国和它的总部设立在美国。这在地理上造成很大的不方便，更不用说美国的秩序是不利于在那里设置这类国际组织的。如果现在来选择联合国总部的地点，那末，非洲人民、黑人未必会同意把联合国总部设置在不把黑人当人看待、黑人遭到最残酷的歧视、甚至受私刑之害的国家中。
    所有这一切和国际生活中的其他许多因素说明，现在需要对各种价值作重新估价，需要对重要的世界问题的解决采取新的态度。
    联合国成立时正确地规定了：它的主要宗旨是保障和平，解决造成紧张局势和会导致第三次世界大战爆发的那些问题。当时主要的注意力放在设立一个能够对付国际困难和冲突的机构。设立安全理事会的目的正在于此。
    安理会由十一个理事国组成，其中有五个常任理事国，这在当时是很正确的。当时确定，由美国、苏联、中国、英国和法国作为常任理事国。
    我想特别指出的一点是，正是这五个当时都被认为是大国的国家担任了安理会常任理事国。当时作为联合国的组织者的政治活动家的英明之处在于：他们承认安理会中的每个大国都有平等权利，尽管当时社会主义国家在世界上是占绝对少数。当时只有苏联和蒙古人民共和国是社会主义国家，但是，承认了苏联这个社会主义国家同安全理事会其他常任理事国一样有这些权利。联合国宪章规定的大国一致的原则和否决权就是承认这一平等原则的表现。谁也不能采取有害于和平、有害于五大国之中某一国的某种决定性的决定，即使是四国对一国也不行。
    总之，当时资本主义国家在世界上占优势。但是，联合国创始人的考虑是正确的，他们认为，只有在多数——而这种多数就是资本主义国家、殖民主义国家——不滥用自己的地位来反对少数的情况下，联合国才能担负起委托给它的任务。只有在这种情况下，联合国才能够存在、发展和起作用，而联合国正是为了起这种作用才成立的。
    联合国大会第十五届会议召开的世界政治局势是怎样的呢？我重说一遍，这种局势已与联合国成立时大不相同了。
    我已经说过，首先出现了世界社会主义体系，这个体系的国家拥有地球上三分之一以上的人口。社会主义国家拥有巨大的经济潜力，目前，它们的产量已占世界总产量的三分之一以上，而在许多极重要的工农业生产方面，几乎占世界产量的一半。
    其次，在殖民主义体系的废墟上出现了许多奉行不参加军事集团政策的独立国家。它们是印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、阿拉伯联合共和国、加纳共和国、几内亚共和国、尼日利亚共和国等。
    以前的殖民主义、帝国主义大国的情况也发生了重大的变化。现在，根据什么法律可以认为英国是大国，而印度不是大国？以前手持大棒的被认为是大国，又是根据什么法律。当时主要的殖民主义国家正是英国。它用火和剑使别国服从于它，并挥舞大棒来进行统治。它几乎控制了半个世界，并以此确立了它的威力。现在，情况变化了。在第二次世界大战结束后，英国对它过去失去的东西，只好算了。它现在还保持下来的东西和正在用武力残酷地镇压某些殖民地国家的行径，这说明它的力量在没落，而不是上升。它的士兵还在走着维多利亚女皇时代的道路，而且英国有些人不愿意了解，现在是另一个时代了。英国早已不再是第一个世界工厂了，早已不再是海上霸王了。
    法国也是帝国主义殖民主义国家，它以同样的方法使自己强大起来——掠夺和残酷地奴役非洲人民和亚洲人民。现在，这个大国已经同阿尔及利亚进行了六年多的战争，并且丝毫也未能在停止强盗政策方面表现出它的伟大。时代变了。现在，各国人民正在同他们的压迫者、殖民者进行着争取自由的你死我活的斗争，正在为捍卫自己的人的权利成功地进行斗争。
    为什么法国被认为是大国，而印度尼西亚就不是呢？为什么印度和印度尼西亚在联合国中所处的条件与英国和法国不同，例如，它们不是安理会常任理事国。
    或者，拿美国来说吧。它仍然是最强盛的资本主义国家。但是，如果以前美国是一个吸引力，被认为是新兴的垄断资本国家，并以其资产阶级民主宪法吸引人，那么现在这点已经消失。现今，美国是垄断资本统治的反动的国家，是奉行帝国主义政策、与殖民者有联系并成为殖民者头目的国家。
    在美国，尽管存在着民主的外表，但是一切受制于、服从于资本和军国主义。垄断资本霸占了一切：生产资料和生产工具、以及诸如报纸、出版社、电视、电台、电影等这些强大的思想宣传工具，这一切都被用来压制人们的意志、欺骗人民群众。
    以前，美国在其经济发展和实力方面在世界上显得特别突出。它与欧洲和亚洲远隔重洋，这是欧洲和亚洲战争兴起时期不可逾越的障碍。战争、饥饿、破坏，所有这一切美国都没有经受过。现在，大洋不再是美国外围的不可逾越的唯一堡垒。美国及其特殊的经济地位正在丧失。
    苏联、所有社会主义国家在经济发展方面已经取得了巨大的成就。在许多科学部门、在教育、文化、艺术方面，我们已经超过了美国，更不用说社会主义国家人民所获得的政治和社会制度的优越性。
    美国丧失了它以前所具有的那种吸引力。相反地，现在使各国人民和各国脱离美国的力量在起作用。这是重要的变化。美国人自己还没有完全意识到这点，可以说，世界上许多人还没有意识到这点，但是，他们感觉到这点，虽然没有从已经改变了的条件中作出结论。因此，美国在国际舞台上现在已经不是像它先前那样的大国，虽然在资本主义国家中它在经济和军事方面现在是最强盛的。
    在成立联合国的时候，中国是四分五裂的，它很少被考虑。如果说，垄断资本国家使它加入安理会，那么，显然这样做是为了使中国依附于资本主义世界，使中国不受社会主义思想，即马克思列宁主义思想的感染。帝国主义国家想保存中国万里长城，使这个城墙服务于垄断资本，成为使社会主义世界与资本主义世界隔绝的城堡。
    但是，中国人民根据自己的意志确定了他们怎样生活。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下在英勇的解放斗争中取得了伟大的胜利。中国人民成功地利用了第二次世界大战以后所形成的有利形势，当时欧洲法西斯势力被击溃，军国主义的日本被击溃。这就为中国人民解放军创造了可靠的后方。中国人民解放军击溃了当时完全站在美国方面、站在帝国主义方面的蒋介石军队。
    在中国成为人民的、真正中国的国家后，在它的政府真正反映人民的意志和愿望后，帝国主义垄断资本国家不承认它。帝国主义者不承认中国人的中国，而承认被美国人占领的台湾岛是“中国”。甚至不让人民中国进入联合国和占有自己的合法席位。
    为什么会发生这样情况呢？中国已经消失了吗？不，中国在！中国存在！它已经不是大国了吗？不，中国现在真正是大国、在经济和政治方面更为强大的国家。他们不承认中国，是因为中国是社会主义国家。由于社会主义中国的出现而产生的恐惧，使帝国主义者丧失健全的思考，他们否认中国人的中国的存在。
    然而，我们知道，历史上有着类似情况。要知道，极端无耻的帝国主义者曾在一个很长时期中认为苏联不是大国，而只是一个地理概念。美国曾在十六年中不承认苏联。我再说一遍，我们知道类似的情况。
    的确，最近就连许多资产阶级的政治家也看到美国对中国的政策是不明智的，并且谴责这种政策。美国要坚持不承认人民中国的政策一年比一年困难，在联大的历届会议上，机械的多数受到挫折，对中国采取机械多数的政策被揭露。看来，不久的将来这一政策将被彻底粉碎。如果，上帝没有惩罚美国国家负责人，没有剥夺他们的理智，那么，对他们来讲最好就是主张恢复中国在联合国的权利、驱逐蒋介石傀儡。美国国家负责人能否利用上帝的恩赐？我们不能预测，时间会证明！但是，如果他们行动不理智，那么在不久的将来，他们将会由于对人民中国所采取的政策而自食其恶果。
    人民中国、印度、印度尼西亚、日本、缅甸和亚洲其他国家在国际生活中、在世界政治中起着日益重大的作用。
    在非洲，近几年来也发生了巨大的变化。在联合国成立的时候，在非洲实际上共有三个独立的国家。这一大陆的整个领土被殖民主义者瓜分，殖民主义者压迫非洲人民好几十年。现今，非洲完全是另一个样子。现在，在这个大陆上出现了二十六个独立国家，其人口为一亿八千万以上。特别值得注意的是，这些国家绝大多数（二十六个中的十六个）是在今年1960年宣布独立的。
    出席联合国大会的年轻的非洲国家的代表说，1960年是非洲年。整个非洲燃起民族解放运动的烈火。但是，今天在非洲大陆上还有二十多个国家和托管地处于殖民主义压迫下。在这些国家中，居住着五千多万人。殖民地和附属国人民为反对外来压迫而斗争，它们无疑将会获得独立。
    这就是联合国成立后十五年来的世界社会和政治形势的一些特点。
    帝国主义国家——参加西方国家军事集团的垄断资本国家，打算依靠武力来巩固在联合国成立时它们在联合国中所占据的统治地位。它们不惜一切地想掌握住这种统治，虽然实际上历史已经剥夺了它们的这种权利，我是说主要是剥夺了它们的这种可能性。帝国主义国家过去赖以压迫世界上许多国家的那种原有的经济上的优势，正在丧失。帝国主义国家在它们奉行“实力地位”政策时原先所依靠的军事方面的优势，也丧失了。
    但是，帝国主义国家的统治集团总是有这样一种错觉，仿佛它们仍然保持着自己原来的统治。
    因此，苏联代表团在联大第十五届会议上提出关于联合国结构已经过时了的问题，这是必然的和完全合乎情理的。这个结构在联合国成立时，即1945年的时候，是符合各国力量对比、作用和意义的。但是，它完全不符合当前的时代。必须根据社会主义国家、帝国主义国家和中立主义国家这三类主要国家在国际舞台上的新的力量对比关系来改变联合国结构，这样的必要性已经成熟了。这样提出问题已经得到本届会议许多参加者的支持和理解。
    我们还没有提出具体的建议，但是，我们表示了对这一问题的原则性的立场。
    我们提出改变联合国执行机构的结构的问题，不是因为我们自己想在联合国中有某种特权。我们的立场（社会主义国家的立场）现在是众所周知的，任何头脑清醒的人们也不能否认社会主义国家在联合国中的主要作用。
    在联合国中，没有社会主义国家，就不能算是真正的联合国。为什么呢？人们可能说，社会主义国家现在是少数。但是，谁认为这一类或那一类国家在联合国中的作用是取决于该类国家的数目的话，谁就是愚蠢的人。如果拥有全世界威力的一半、占世界人口三分之一的国家在联合国中没有代表的话，那么，联合国就真正失去了它作为世界组织的意义。
    社会主义的成就甚至对这样一些人也是有吸引力的，这些人不承认我们的体系，但是，又无法把它抛开，不能轻视它的蓬勃发展。只有瞎子才能轻视这一点。他说，世界不存在了，太阳也没有了，别人所说的世界、太阳都是神话。
    我们认为，应该改善联合国，使之成为以防止新的世界大战为目的的国际机构。为此，首先要回到在成立联合国和联合国安全理事会时所确定的思想和原则上来，即承认一切国家、特别是那些决定新的世界大战是否爆发的国家一律平等的原则。
    如果在过去联合国成立的时候，美国、苏联、中国、英国和法国被称为五大国，那么，现在这个大国的名册当然要大大地扩充。当然，现在在这个名册里包括法国和英国，而不包括印度和印度尼西亚是不行的，更不消说恢复人民中国的权利了。
    本着自己集团自私利益办事的帝国主义殖民国家，破坏了在联合国成立时所奠定的某些基础，它们开始回避联合国宪章。宪章规定，安全理事会应该在五大国——安理会常任理事国的一致同意下解决最重要的问题。当西方国家代表无法通过自己的决定时，他们就绕路而行，把这些问题直接提到联合国大会。
    这样一来，为了保障和平而规定的安理会一致的这个极重要的原则就被他们破坏了。他们规避这个原则，想要在联合国大会上以机械的多数或三分之二的多数解决这种问题，指望表决机器给他们带来运气。然而要知道，这不是摆脱困境的出路。他们只能打开爆发把人类引向世界性战争浩劫的冲突的气门。
    这种局面会加剧这样一种危险性，即联合国本身可能把世界推向战争的边缘，或推向战争的深渊。必须严格遵守联合国宪章关于安理会在解决最复杂的国际问题时大国一致的原则。但是，这只是问题的一方面。还必须考虑到世界上已经发生变化的条件，考虑世界舞台上新的力量对比情况。由五大国的代表作为安全理事会的常任理事现在显然已经不够了。
    因此，现在必须这样来建立联合国的组织结构，即三类国家——社会主义国家、帝国主义国家和中立国家——在解决在很大程度上决定战争与和平的国际问题时拥有平等的地位。
    谁因循守旧，想保留旧的，不承认新事物，谁就不了解旧的东西不会有助于加强和平。在这些旧的东西里隐藏着发生战争的巨大危险。谁不考虑所有三类国家的利益，想要利用国际组织来为一类国家，即为帝国主义垄断资本国家谋利，谁就不是以加强和平的利益为方针。
    因此必须改变联合国的结构，使它的执行机构符合生活的要求，符合所有三类国家都有平等代表权的原则。否则，这就不是联合国而是分裂国。
    上面我谈的是改变安理会的结构。当然这完全适用于联合国的执行机构，适用于它的秘书长。一个人无论他的天灵盖有七吋宽，也不能一下子客观地反映三类国家的利益。
    很自然，由于奉行帝国主义殖民主义政策的美国以及它的盟国英国、法国和其他垄断资本主义国家目前在联合国中占统治地位，联合国领导职位的人选都是由他们提出的他们自己的人。联合国的现任秘书长哈马舍尔德先生是谁提的候选人呢？大家都很清楚，他是美国的候选人。瑞典人说，他是瑞典的代表。不错，他是在瑞典出生，可是他在政治观点上却是美国垄断资本的代表，他为它们服务。让瑞典人不要抱怨这一点吧。我们也有自己在美国的哈马舍尔德，这就是克伦斯基。他是俄国人，可是他为谁服务呢？他为美国帝国主义资本服务，而俄国人民多少年来没有他也照样很有成就。
    当然，每一类国家都希望有自己的秘书长候选人。这是很自然的，但是是不现实的。每个想要在联合国的执行机构里提出自己的代表的各类国家都想占统治地位，因此我们主张，使任何一类国家都不在联合国执行机构——秘书处里占有统治地位。
    所以，最根本和最公正地解决联合国秘书处和安全理事会问题的办法就是，实行权利平等、机会平等和代表权平等的原则。联合国秘书处应该由三个秘书组成。
    有人会反对说，那时怎样来解决各种问题呢，要知道那时将是非常复杂的。在一个国家的议会中，特别是在资产阶级国家议会中，解决问题也是复杂的，因为那里存在着对立的阶级，每个阶级有它的政党，有它的代表。统治阶级执行着自己的政策，即镇压其他阶级的政策。它们依靠资本这样来做，而资本是一种巨大的力量。资本似乎没有参加表决，但是，它可以收买，因此，它就通过收买其他阶级的代表来表达自己的意见。但是，这毕竟是一个国家。
    把这种议会制度移植到国际组织中，是毫无道理的。联合国包括有大约一百个国家，而现今世界明显地分为三个国家体系。如果开始压抑这类或那类国家，这就意味着走上使用武力的道路，走上备战的道路。但是，要知道联合国的成立不是为了进行战争，而是作为保障和平的工具。
    为了保证持久和平，必须使任何一类国家的利益都不受到侵犯，要使国际问题的解决考虑到所有三类国家的利益。只有在这种条件下才能保障和平。
    如果联合国、安全理事会、大会和执行机构只遵循单方面的政策，而不考虑所有三类国家的利益的话，那么，在这种情况下，联合国本身和它的决议就会得不到所有国家的尊重。在这种情况下，任何一类国家都不能要求其它国家必须执行所通过的决议。这种局面会使国际紧张局势达到顶点，以至于会由一个偶然的火花而燃起世界大战的火焰。
    第二次世界大战以后，至今还遗留下德国问题没有解决。大国和小国都参加了联合国，可是德国人民却没有参加。联合国接纳了意大利，接纳了过去曾经是军国主义国家的日本，也接纳了西班牙和葡萄牙这些法西斯国家。为什么联合国没有德国人民的代表呢？因为对德和约没有缔结。帝国主义国家人为地拖延缔结和约，它们想用这种办法不承认德意志民主共和国。但是这是愚蠢的政策，因为德意志民主共和国十一年来存在着和发展着。应当结束这种现象，并缔结对德和约。应当解决这个问题，应当把战后所形成的情况和所发生的变化肯定下来，以便使德国人民平等地在联合国有自己的代表。
    我重复一次，缔结对德和约对于缓和国际紧张局势具有重大的意义。保持同德国的战争状态，除了毒化气氛以外，没有别的结果，因为在缔结和约的时候，需要解决的所有问题事实上已经得到承认。
    显然，现在必须按照客观实际情况来解决这些问题，只需要把存在着两个德国、第二次世界大战后所确定的边界的不可动摇性这样的现存情况肯定下来。
    任何一个头脑清醒的政治家都不会设想，德意志民主共和国会有人让步或者放弃社会主义成果，也不会认为，西德今天会放弃自己的政治制度和社会制度。所以，应当在事实上承认目前已经形成的局面，并把这些在相应的条约中记录下来。
    在西柏林问题上，我们也曾多次提出合理的解决办法。
    德国问题现在已经被人们用来达到政治目的，在某些国家它被利用来进行竞选活动。
    美国现在正举行总统选举。德国问题必然出现在竞选活动中：德国的状态改变或不改变，也就是说是否要同两个德国缔结和约或者维持现状，——这往往是竞选中热烈争辩的题目。主张保存战争策源地的侵略集团企图利用德国问题来推行自己的“实力地位”政策。而在这样的问题上较量力量是危险的。
    在西德，也有人利用关于对德和约的问题。于是就造成这样一种情况，例如，人们说，在1960年不能提出关于解决德国问题的问题，不能达成关于这个问题的协议，因为美国的总统选举妨碍这一点。有人向我们暗示，说在选举的时候不要去谈论德国问题，等选举结束时将能够达成协议。
    但是在1961年西德将开始选举。那里也有侵略集团——垄断资本的代表，他们利用着这个问题。那里也有一些人士暗示，阿登纳总理不会放弃这个观点，因为，否则，勃兰德将在选举中获胜。因此，有人说什么忍耐一下吧，当选举结束时就可以创造条件，对德国问题的解决采取比较现实的态度了。
    就这样无止境地拖延关于缔结对德和约的极其重要的问题，而这个问题是急需解决的，这个问题的搁置包藏着很大的军事危险。
    这个问题应当解决。看来，1961年必须解决这个问题。
    健康的理智应当战胜！必须签订和约，到那时在欧洲就可以用完全不同的方式呼吸了。
    西德反对德意志民主共和国的步骤（破坏贸易协定等）正在导致尖锐化，因为德意志民主共和国同样可以采取相应的步骤，所有这一切不是改善国际关系的预兆。
    所以，必须像我们在美国破坏了巴黎会议之后同西方国家约定的那样，不采取会使关系尖锐化的步骤。我们建议在美国总统选举以后举行最高级会晤，以便作出新的努力来解决争端，磋商同两个德国缔结和约的事宜，并在这个基础上解决西柏林问题，使它成为自由城市。
    我们坚持这一立场。但是，如果有人把另外的政策强加于我们，那末，西方帝国主义国家要对此负责。二、全面彻底裁军是通向巩固和平的道路
    同志们！苏联已不止一次地说过，裁军问题是当代所有重大国际问题的关键。
    人类几十年来致力于使世界摆脱破坏性的战争、避免扩军备战以及停止在改进杀人武器方面的竞赛。在过去，这些希望都落空了。当剥削阶级在世界上占绝对统治地位时，当社会被帝国主义加剧到顶点的不可调和的阶级矛盾所分裂、有半数以上人类遭受殖民主义压迫时，国与国之间为瓜分世界而不断进行的战争就成了社会生活的经常伴侣。
    在出现世界社会主义体系之前，任何摆脱战争的企图都只不过是美梦和幻想而已。甚至有时候这些美梦和幻想成了欺骗人们的工具。不妨回忆一下，例如，在第一次世界大战期间，资产阶级硬说，这次战争应当由协约国取胜，以便不再发生战争。但是，我们知道，在第一次世界大战后，战争还是不少的，最后，法西斯分子在美、英、法三国帝国主义者的纵容下，发动了破坏性更大的第二次世界大战。
    现在，当科学创造了具有空前破坏力的武器的时候，任何新的世界大战都将会给人类带来无穷灾难和痛苦。我们深信，一旦爆发新战争，人类是不会毁灭的，人类只会彻底地、坚决地甩掉产生战争的腐朽的资本主义制度。但是，试问，需要不需要以这种可怕的代价来取得新制度的胜利？是否必须以亿万人流血牺牲的代价来求得在过去的废墟上确立新制度呢？有没有别的道路呢？
    每个明智的人都懂得，有必要创造这样的条件，就是：排除一些国家为了靠牺牲其他国家来发财致富而进行战争的可能性。马克思列宁主义者看到有这种可能性。
    我们马克思列宁主义者深知战争与和平问题的全部复杂性。战争是随着社会分裂为阶级而产生的。随着把社会划分为富人和穷人、有产者和无产者、剥削者和被剥削者现象的消灭，随着新社会制度（这种制度不是建立在人对人是豺狼这样一个资产阶级的兽性原则上）的建立，战争的危险和发生战争的土壤也将随着被彻底地、一去不复返地消灭。
    这样的世界同资本主义世界将毫无共同之处，在资本主义世界里，占统治地位的是强者掠夺和剥削弱者这样的法则。在帝国主义国家里，谁有资本，谁就有一切。而那些从事创造一切物质和精神财富的、但是没有资本、被剥夺了生产资料的普通劳动人民却遭受剥削和歧视。
    美国统治集团把所谓美国生活方式吹嘘为“自由世界”的榜样。然而，这是什么样的自由呢？这是剥削的自由，掠夺的自由，在物资过剩的情况下饿死的自由，在存在没被利用的生产能力的情况下遭到失业的自由。美国的自由，就是垄断资本压迫劳动人民的自由，就是用两党制愚弄人们并把自己的意志强加于它的军事集团伙伴的自由。这样的社会制造着国与国之间发生战争的土壤，因为，垄断资本和帝国主义的特点就是对内实行反动政策，对外实行扩张和侵略。
    在帝国主义占绝对统治的条件下维持和平是不可能的。但是，随着新的社会制度——替代资本主义制度的社会主义的出现，形势改变了。社会主义制度是最先进的制度，它建立了人与人之间关系上的新准则、各民族和国家之间关系上的新准则。我们确信，全人类将走向社会主义、共产主义——走向一个和谐的社会，这个社会将没有对立的阶级：它将建筑在最人道的原则——人对人是兄弟和朋友这一原则之上。
    在工人阶级和劳动农民取得胜利之后，在任何一个国家里，都将不再有爆发战争的社会的、民族的或任何其他的根源了。当社会主义制度共产主义制度在全世界占完全的统治地位时，将出现这种情况。那时，全人类将成为一个由平等民族组成的真正大家庭。
    关于这个问题，马克思列宁主义的奠基人早就阐述过，并且科学地证实它。
    资本主义制度的消灭是社会发展的根本问题。但是只有冒险分子才会认为，社会制度的改变可以用在国与国之间挑起战争的方法来实现。社会革命是不能输出的。它是不能用刺刀或火箭来移植的。正如我们不允许任何人把另一种同我们格格不入的生活方式强加于我们一样，同样，我们也不想干涉他国内政，因为生活方式是每个国家不可剥夺的权利。解决在何种社会条件下生活的问题，这取决于各国人民自己，取决于该国的内部发展和条件的成熟。这个国家或是那个国家应当属于哪种制度——社会主义还是资本主义，这不是国际关系问题，也不是在联合国这样国际场所讨论的问题，联合国是代表不同社会制度国家的。这个问题应由各国人民自己来解决。
    必须考虑具体的现实，考虑世界的现状。在现今的世界，有社会主义国家，有参加美国军事集团的资本主义国家，也有不参加任何军事集团并奉行中立政策的国家。因此，应该谋求这样来解决主要的国际问题，即考虑已经形成的条件，考虑在不同国家内同时存在着对立的社会制度，以便在这种情况下创造条件，排除新的世界大战的可能性。核战争将使城市和工厂遭到空前的破坏。它将给亿万人民带来死亡。它将毁灭掉世世代代用劳动创造的财富，它将使一切国家和一切人民遭到损害。它的后果将严重地影响到下一代的生活。
    如果我们容忍这种不好的命运，不设法防止世界大战的威胁，那么我们就是对这一代和下一代的人犯罪。这是不可原谅的，因为社会主义交给工人阶级和全体劳动人民的防御力量和可能性是我们在社会主义国家出现以前不能想像的。
    这就是我们对待战争与和平问题的立场。
    如果资本主义国家比社会主义强大，就认为资本主义国家会同意裁军，那是天真的想法。现在的局面是，世界社会主义体系至少不弱于被美国纠合在北大西洋公约组织、中央条约组织和东南亚条约组织这样一些侵略军事集团中的国家。社会主义国家现在拥有前所未有的影响资本主义国家的手段，如果愿意的话甚至可以迫使它们签订裁军协定。
    如果考虑到许多国家的民族解放运动、争取裁军和世界和平的人民运动的力量，以及在现今条件下资产阶级中的一部分人有和平愿望的话，那末，有利于裁军的不仅仅是我们的可以给对社会主义国家的任何进攻以毁灭性打击的物质力量，而且还有世界各国人民对我们争取和平和停止军备竞赛的斗争的支持。
    因此，当苏联政府提出全面彻底裁军建议的时候，它在这方面是以现实的政治、经济和道义因素为依据的。如果各国人民坚持不懈地为和平、为全面彻底裁军、为在最严格的国际监督下销毁进行战争的手段而斗争的话，世界大战是可以防止的。
    所有这一切都可能吗？可能。无论谁都不否认，这是件困难的事，但是，如果爆发了战争，那么这对人民就会更加沉重。因此，问题就这样摆着：我们共产党人在这些困难面前是退却，这也就是说，跟那些主张继续军备竞赛的帝国主义势力走（军备竞赛，如果继续下去，就会导致战争），还是不遗余力筑起一道堤坝，阻挡事态这样的发展。我们反对宿命论，反对在战争与和平问题上的消极态度。不应该低估，尤其不应该夸大那些主张备战的帝国主义势力的可能性。
    只要存在着帝国主义国家，只要热中于侵略、热中于帝国主义战争成性的垄断资本在这些国家占统治地位，那么，也就存在新战争的威胁。但是，正是对这种势力，我们能够，而且应当用更强大的一种力量来对抗，这种力量就是：各国人民制止战争的决心、坚决粉碎任何帝国主义侵略的愿望。
    同帝国主义对抗的这种力量是有的，这就是社会主义国家，社会主义国家在自己的政策中所遵循的不仅是本国人民的利益，而且还有各国人民、所有劳动人民的利益。它们依靠不仅仅是社会主义人道主义，而且依靠的是自己的社会主义经济，它们拥有捍卫社会主义各国的国家利益的强大的武装力量。
    我们的力量在于：社会主义国家的利益同包括资本主义国家在内的所有国家的劳动人民的利益是一致的。资本主义国家的劳动人民站在为和平及和平共处而斗争的立场上。此外，还必须同这加在一起的是：愈来愈多的国家摆脱了殖民主义压迫，一般是走上不结盟的道路，即走上和平政策的道路，从而破坏帝国主义原有的后方和后备。虽然帝国主义国家企图利用许多国家的中立路线来达到自己的目的，而中立国家有时也跟着它们合唱这种或那种调子，但是，这是暂时的现象。
    在战争与和平的问题上不可能有中立，因为所有的人民都希望和平，因而，所有的人民都应当为争取和平、反对新战争的威胁而斗争。和平力量和战争力量划清界限的过程将加速和发展。这个过程将壮大主张和平的力量。
    中立国家的人民面临着历史的抉择。帝国主义阵营企图把他们拖入军备竞赛，使这些国家的人力和物力为战争服务。帝国主义不给它们任何东西来消除殖民主义的过去所遗留下来的经济落后状态。帝国主义并没有停止企图干涉它们的内政，以便把新的殖民主义枷锁套在它们的头上。
    社会主义国家大家庭向年轻的国家提出了另一条道路——不参加军备竞赛，发展经济和文化，不容许干涉内政。
    人民将作出什么样的抉择，这还用得着说吗？可以不必怀疑，他们将选择和平和自由的道路，而不是战争和新的奴役的道路。这个选择会无比地壮大主张和平的力量。
    由于社会主义和和平力量的增长，国际舞台上形成了不利于帝国主义的力量对比。现在如果用议会的死板公式来确定社会主义与和平力量同帝国主义力量的分界线和力量对比，那将是错误的。归根到底决定力量对比的不是站在这一边或站在那一边——站在社会主义一边或站在帝国主义一边的国家的数目。
    在确定力量对比时必须考虑到很多因素——经济潜力和军事潜力、人口以及其他的物质的和精神的因素。在这里，应用简单的算术，会使人上大当。
    甚至在确定存在对抗阶级的国家内部的力量对比时，算术的尺度也不能提供清楚的概念。因为大家知道，决定这个或那个资本主义国家政党和阶级力量的实际对比的不是议会中席位的数目。
    资产阶级国家的宪法和选举制度赋予统治的剥削阶级以大量特权，而不是给被剥削阶级、劳动人民阶级以大量特权。这一点可以从法国的例子中看到，在那里，共产党在最近一次议会选举中获得三百八十八万八千二百零四票和十个议席，而像保卫新共和联盟这样的右翼资产阶级政党获得三百六十万八千九百五十八票和一百八十八个议席。因此我说，用议会的方法来或多或少正确地确定这些或那些资产阶级国家内部力量的对比，是不适宜的。
    那时，在资产阶级国家里的政权是用什么来维持呢？为什么得到群众巨大支持的无产阶级政党往往在议会中没有相应数目的代表呢？这是因为，资产阶级采取种种选举阴谋，依靠为垄断资本服务的警察、军队、法院和立法等镇压力量的支持，资产阶级政权也就是建筑在这上面的。它所依仗的是：统治阶级掌握有生产资料、思想影响的手段，镇压民主和革命进步运动的手段。这就是垄断资本的专政。
    如果用这种议会方法来测定社会主义国家和帝国主义国家力量的对比，那就很容易被数字纠缠住而看不到正确的情景。因为否则就无法解释下面的事实：十月革命所诞生的年轻的社会主义国家当时是世界上唯一的、软弱的、尚未巩固起来的国家，然而就能够保持住存在的权利。要知道，当时来反对我国的有十四个国家。美国、法国、英国、德国、日本等国家的军队蹂躏了我们的国土。年轻的苏维埃国家粉碎了这些力量，把他们赶了出去。
    应该随时记住列宁的教导：政治——这不是算术。苏维埃国家当时所依靠的不只是自己的内部力量，工人阶级和劳动农民，而且也依靠了资产阶级国家工人阶级和进步的社会阶层的国际支持。这还是四十三年以前的情况。
    现在的情况完全是另外一个样子。苏联已经成长为巨大的力量。我们的经济不断繁荣。我们有强大的、装备优良的工业，它能生产必要数量的最现代化的防御手段。我们有协调的国家机器。我们拥有高度熟练的工程技术和科学干部的大军，他们能完成任何任务。我们有用火箭—核武器装备起来的第一流的现代化军队。苏联科学技术发展的高度进步是世界闻名的。
    此外，现在我们不是孤立的。在欧洲和亚洲有的国家也走上了社会主义道路，并在这条道路上顺利地发展。这些新的社会主义国家无论在国家建设——社会主义建设方面，以及在自己的武装力量的建设方面都已经取得了巨大成就。
    我还曾经说过，有三分之一以上的国家走上了中立的道路，这是帝国主义过去的后方、人力和原料资源的供应者。帝国主义已丧失了这些资源，再也不能把它们拉回到殖民主义的老路了。
    在确定力量对比时，必须考虑到所有这些条件，那时就会明显地看到，现今主张和平的力量不比主张发动战争的力量更弱，而是更强。我们应该明确地意识到这点，才能现实地估计我们的力量，不低估我们自己维护和平政策的可能性。
    苏联过去是、现在仍然是站在同不同社会制度国家和平共处的立场上。但是，我们并不乞求这种和平共处。我们是在清醒地估计现代世界力量对比的基础上提出这种政策的。
    所有的人民都要走向社会主义、共产主义。这是社会发展的规律。有些人会说，既然我们的力量不小于，甚至大于我们敌人的力量，那又为什么不用战争手段来解决争端？为什么不加速历史的发展呢？但是，历史不是马，是不能用鞭子赶它的。资产阶级政治家声称，苏联需要和平共处，只是作为暂时的措施，说我们共产党人只是等待时机发动战争，并用这种战争来改变其国家的政治和社会制度。而我们说：你们是在撒谎。马克思列宁主义确认，每个国家的阶级斗争会解决力量对比问题，使之有利于这个或那个阶级。当革命的无产阶级的力量增强以后，无产阶级就按着自己的意志、也就是根据无产阶级的利益、革命阶级的利益去解决政权和社会制度存在的问题。而解决这个问题采取什么途径，要看存在着什么样具体的条件和旧的统治阶级用什么样的方法来对付他们。
    如果认为通过社会主义国家和资本主义国家之间的战争来解决内部政治和社会问题，是一种规律，那么这只有利于社会主义的敌人。社会主义的敌人就会利用这一点来反对马克思列宁主义学说，反对社会主义国家。那时他们就会说：你们看，这算是什么进步的制度，算是什么进步的学说，如果必须用武力来把它们强加给各国人民的话。
    社会主义之所以强大，是由于它的生命力，是由于它符合人民群众的最切身的利益。社会主义和共产主义建设的整个实践证明了这一点。在群众中传播社会主义思想，不需要暴力，这是连小学生都知道的真理，但是我们的反对者——共产主义的敌人每次都竭力歪曲这个真理。
    有什么能比苏联和其他社会主义国家的例子更能吸引人对社会主义的同情呢？人人知道，沙皇俄国是一个多么落后的国家。人人也知道，我国在社会主义发展的年代里变成了多么先进和强大的国家。我国由落后的国家变成了强大的、高度发展的社会主义国家。社会主义为经济发展、文化繁荣和科学发达创造了在资本主义条件下不可想像的条件。我们的敌人也承认这点。
    示范的力量是伟大的力量。我们的事业越好，社会主义国家的生活水平越高，人心就会越快地转向社会主义这方面。这是一种不能用算术来计算的力量。
    如果谈到社会主义国家拥有怎样的防止新战争的可能性这样一个问题，那么应当说，这个重要问题的解决不取决于主张和平的国家和加入西方国家军事集团的国家的数目。大家知道，资本主义国家目前比社会主义国家多得多。如果我们以必须进行算术统计为出发点，那么这只能在政治上造成混乱。
    现在，力量的对比使我们能够提出并争取裁军问题的实际解决。全面彻底裁军思想现在已成为动员各国人民为维护和平和制止新战争而斗争的强有力的武器。正因为如此，每一个人、每一国家的人民都有义务捍卫这个思想，为这个思想而斗争，为和平而斗争。
    苏联政府对裁军的立场已经详细地确定，并向联合国阐述过了。这个建议还以书面的形式提交给各国。这个建议的目的，我已在纽约讲过，是为了准备缔结全面彻底裁军条约。我们规定，在裁军的第一阶段就应该销毁运送核武器至目标的一切手段，并撤除在别国领土上的军事基地、取销军用飞机等等。我们还规定禁止核武器以及停止它的生产和试验，销毁所有的核武器储存。简单地说，我们主张有国际监督的真正裁军。
    英国首相麦克米伦先生在纽约大致是这样说的：裁军谈判可以进行五年到十年。
    但是，要知道，军备竞赛没有停止。现在是三个或者甚至是四个国家拥有核武器。而五年到十年后又会怎样呢？那时将会有许多国家拥有这种武器。
    我们反对在裁军这样重要的问题上拖延，我们不同意用无限期的谈判来欺骗人民。虽然英国首相麦克米伦先生是苏格兰人，但是，我丝毫不想用“拖延”的字眼来攻击他，因为这个字的发音，照英格兰人的理解是风笛的意思，这是一种民族乐器，而我所说的拖延是在讨论重要问题上的拖拉。我们的建议是完全现实的。我们坚持能够产生有益结果的谈判，我们反对那些只会使人头脑混乱、欺骗各国人民的谈判。
    西方有些人说，苏联在大会上提出自己的建议是为了宣传目的。我们不怕这种责难：要知道，我们没有叫嚷战争，我们要求为巩固的和平创造条件。这样的宣传我们将继续进行下去。它不会给各国人民带来损失。但是，如果西方国家害怕有益于和平的宣传，那我们不讲也行。
    我们有无所不包的裁军建议，让西方国家提出它们的建议吧。我们坐下来逐条地实事求是地讨论，什么可以接受，什么不能接受。
    我想补充一句，不能把保障和平的责任，也就是把达成裁军协定和销毁武器的责任只加在那些拥有核武器的国家身上。这是不正确的，也是危险的。
    不关心解决裁军问题的人民是没有的。如果这些或那些没有相当强大的军队、工业不发达的国家被排除在促使裁军问题的解决以外，那么，它们不会因此而减少使自己、使本国人民和全世界招致空前核战争的军事灾难的威胁，而是加强这种威胁。
    各国人民，无论是大国或小国人民，各个国家，无论是强国或弱国，在目前争取解决裁军和销毁武器问题的斗争中，都应该表现出他们在争取自由和独立的斗争中所表现的那种关心和顽强精神。
    最近，英国首相麦克米伦先生在保守党代表大会上讲了话。他对他出席了联合国大会表示满意，照他的话说，这是一次“出色的会议”，有几乎来自一百个国家的代表出席了这次会议。他在讲话中承认，人类正面临这样的抉择——在解决争执问题上，走使用武力的道路，还是走谈判的道路。麦克米伦先生主张就争执问题进行谈判以缓和紧张局势。
    苏联政府同意这种立场，而且我们已不止一次地证明，和平共处政策，这不是策略手腕，而是伟大的列宁遗留给我们的苏联外交的总路线。过去我们站在这个立场上，今后我们仍将站在这个立场上！
    但是，为了使麦克米伦先生希望缓和紧张局势的说法不致于仅仅是一种可贵的愿望，西方国家需要做具体的事情。麦克米伦先生承认，在裁军问题上，讨论“还没有达到采取行动的地步”。这是意味深长的承认。如果英国政府真的像麦克米伦先生所说的那样，希望“裁军和监督同时进行，以使各个阶段都有裁军和监督”的话，那末，我们同意这样做。
    苏联政府过去和现在都主张真正的裁军，而且用不止一次的单方面裁减自己武装部队的实际行动证明了这一点。如果英国及其盟国——美国、法国以及其他国家都能表现出这种真正的裁军愿望，那末，在就裁军问题达成协议的道路上的主要的和最重要的障碍将会消除，裁军的道路将是畅通无阻的。
    麦克米伦先生，如果您所谈的这一切都是为了解决裁军问题的话，那末，就让我们最后转到实际行动上来吧，而不要再无限期地拖延这个最迫切的问题的解决了。
    如果这是你们的意见和你们的盟国的意见，那么就请对我们的建议提出你们的修正，或者提出你们的无所不包的建议，如果你们不喜欢我们的建议只是因为它是苏联提出来的话。对于我们来说，由谁提出关系不大，对于我们来说，达成裁军协议才是有意义的，因为这能使人类摆脱悲惨的世界大战的威胁。对于我们来说，主要的是裁军，而不是谁第一个就此问题提出这种或那种建议。在离开纽约之前，我曾在联合国大会第十五届会议上就裁军问题作了一次专题发言。我们的建议已登在报纸上，公诸于世。
    我们在联合国还提出了“全面彻底裁军条约基本条款”草案，它也包括关于对保证执行条约条款情况实行严格的、详细的国际监督和调查的系统的条款。
    西方喜欢这样说：摊牌。我们不是拿裁军赌博，但是，如果他们喜欢这样，我们就把我们的牌摊出来了。
    现在轮到西方国家的了。不错，在我们离开纽约以后，这些国家把一些新建议提交大会讨论。其中一个是美国、英国和意大利的建议，依照建议起草人的想法，这个建议包括着解决裁军问题的原则。另一个建议是英国的，它规定成立一个专家委员会，来研究——你们猜是什么——监督问题！
    演说家麦克米伦提出在研究裁军问题时要具体。而这种具体性实际上是不存在的。你们要理解这些人。但是生活会教会他们，生活也会教会麦克米伦先生和麦克米伦之流的先生们。我们现在并不着急。我们对他说：如果你们，先生们，想再试试社会主义国家的威力和忍受力，我们会像通常说的那样，给你们点颜色看看。今天我们是强大的，明天将更为强大，你们，先生们，你们是不会等到由于我们的软弱而欢笑的时刻的。我们——苏联工人、农民、我们的科学家——将一天天、一年年地会使你们由于社会主义力量的成长和加强、由于共产主义力量的成长而悲伤。
    这稍微离开了我事先准备好的讲稿，但是我想，这对于那些现在还不想倾听理智的声音的人来说是不会有坏处的。讨论裁军问题（其中包括监督）已经十五年了，好像十五年还是不够。
    西方国家的两个建议表明，他们仍然没有准备认真对待裁军问题的解决，他们继续利用关于裁军问题的谈判，其中包括本届联大会议上的裁军谈判来掩盖军备竞赛的政策。你们自己可以判断，既然上述关于裁军原则的建议一个字也没有谈到撤除在别国领土上的军事基地，一个字也没有谈到什么时候、在多长期限内实行这种或那种裁军措施，那又怎么能对它有别的评价呢。实质上这是艾森豪威尔总统在联大所鼓吹的、规定对军备实行监督的建议，而不是苏联许多年来所坚持的有监督的裁军。
    西方国家的上述建议不是对未来的好的预兆。
    如果西方国家不愿沿着全面彻底裁军的道路前进，那么我们有权得出结论，即它们现在不准备裁军，但是它们不愿公开对本国人民说出这一点，因为西方国家的人民——美国、英国的人民，世界各国人民都要求裁军。苏联今后也将始终一贯地、顽强地进行争取裁军、争取持久和平和各国人民的安全的斗争。
    我再说一遍，我们主张真正的裁军，一切持有这种主张的人都能同我们找到共同语言。
    各国人民对联合国寄予巨大的希望，他们希望联合国能解决悬而未决的国际问题，并且能争取达到这样一种局面：全世界的和平能得到巩固的保证。
    但是我应该说，如果情况像现在这样下去，那么联合国不会得到重大的结果。联合国的大车已经压出了很深的车辙，它正在沿着这条车辙前进，并且很难得从其中爬出来。
    如果你们看一看联大许多国家的代表的言行，就可以得出结论，联合国不符合各国人民所寄予的希望。
    会议厅常常差不多是空的。在许多国家的代表席上坐着“值班”代表。他们事实上不是在参加联大会议，而只是为了投票，如果需要投票的话。这种代表本国代表团的“值班”人，很像按照程序控制行动的机器人和自动机床。他不需要思考，不需要紧张，而只需要一点——对这个问题或那个问题投票“赞成”或“不赞成”。要影响这种人的心理是完全不可能的，他严格地按照事先所取得的指示行事。
    这使我们更加深信我们向联合国各会员国政府首脑发出的呼吁的正确性，这个呼吁是：十分认真地对待世界所面临的切身重要的国际问题——关于消灭殖民主义制度的问题、关于恢复中国的合法权利的问题、关于美国侵略行为的问题以及其他的问题，而主要的是最重要的国际问题——裁军问题，保证世界和平首先就取决于这个问题的解决。
    毫无疑问，通过联大的一届会议不可能解决所有这些问题。因此，如果真正希望保证持久和平，需要国家首脑或政府首脑参加联大的实际工作。
    我已经在纽约说过，看来，裁军问题在本届会议上是得不到解决的。因此我们认为必须就这个问题专门召开一次特别会议。我们认为，这种会议可以在明年3、4月间召开。如果参加这次会议的国家或政府首脑，能够在原则上、在严格的国际监督下解决全面彻底裁军问题，那么看来，此后需要在人数更加有限的范围内再进行工作。而国家或政府的首脑是可以给我们提议成立的十五国委员会的工作以指示的。
    但是，我再说一遍，没有政府或国家首脑的参加，原则性的、基本的裁军问题是解决不了的，因为在各国之间形成了过多的不信任，各国政府对解决这个问题的分歧太大了。应该表现出健康和勇敢的态度，表现出国家的英明，以便使联合国的大车沿着正确的道路前进。谁能做到这一点呢？只有那些受到本国人民、本国政府充分信任的人才能做到。
    三、给殖民地人民以自由和独立！
    同志们！苏联在联大第15届会议上十分坚决地提出了关于完全和立即消灭过去许多世纪以来遗留下来的野蛮的、令人作呕的遗产——殖民主义的问题。苏联忠于支持被压迫人民争取民族独立斗争的政策，它呼吁联合国发出保卫殖民地解放事业的正义呼声。
    联合国中的很多代表团欢迎和赞同关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言，这个宣言得到了所有爱好自由的人民的热烈支持。
    殖民主义国家和它们的侵略性军事集团的盟国不择任何手段地阻挠殖民地人民争取独立和自由。因此，在联合国大会会议上关于给予殖民地国家独立的问题的讨论，是在尖锐的斗争中进行的。
    爱好自由的人民取得了很大的成功。大会承认苏联提出的消灭殖民主义的问题是极其重要的问题，这个问题被列为大会全体会议的讨论项目。对这个问题的重要性的承认，对苏联来说是很大的精神上的满足，是为反对殖民主义而斗争的力量的巨大胜利。
    在大会上形成了这样一种情况：甚至帝国主义、殖民主义国家也不得不同意在全体会议上讨论这个问题。老实说，在去纽约之前，当我们政府讨论联大会议问题时，我们就曾设想过这样一种可能性，就是美国将同苏联一道投票赞成在大会全体会议上讨论这个问题。
    在讨论大会议程时，第一个发言反对苏联建议的是英国代表。他企图证明殖民主义者所关心的只是促进殖民地的进步和解放。英国代表几乎举手朝天，祈求上帝作证，这个上帝曾经为殖民主义者在殖民地国家的“文明”使命祝福。但是，谁不知道，这种活动表现为奴役人民和消灭土著居民。
    当你谈到殖民主义给殖民地什么样的“文明”时，血管里的血都会凝结起来。在比利时统治的半个世纪以来，刚果的人几乎减少了一半——许多人死于讨伐、远征、饥饿和疾病。刚果不是唯一的例外。在法国统治的六十年来，马达加斯加的人口减少了一半以上。殖民地的婴儿死亡率达到了骇人的规模。例如，在尼日利亚有一半以上的儿童不到六岁就死亡了。在殖民地，工作日最长，工资最低，寿命最短，人口死亡率最高。
    而这是在我们的时代，在进步和伟大的科学发现的时代发生的，在这个时代里人们分裂了原子，成功地征服着宇宙，异常迅速地扩大着对自然力量的控制。在这个时代里，那些觊觎文化发展冠军的国家的代表以自己的“文明”自夸，大谈殖民主义者的什么“恩惠”。你听到这种“恩惠”就会想到，他们马上就要请联大对他们这种“文明的”、也就是殖民主义的奴役政策表示感谢。
    但是摆脱了殖民主义奴役的各国人民的代表说的却是另一样。印度、印度尼西亚、加纳、几内亚、锡兰、利比里亚、摩洛哥、尼日利亚和许多其他国家的代表都在联合国大会上发了言，他们一致要求在联大全体会议上讨论这个问题，坚持必须消灭殖民主义制度。
    美国代表坐在那里，一声不响，就好像他们不在场一样。但是不可能总是沉默，他们总得或者投票赞成苏联关于在联大全体会议上讨论这个问题的建议，或者是支持他们的盟友——殖民主义者。当然，美帝国主义者自己实际上就是殖民主义者，他们把奴役性的条约强加给许多国家的人民，并且剥削他们。这个政策是拉丁美洲各国人民以及其他国家的人民很熟悉的。
    在就这个问题展开热烈的辩论和差不多所有发言者都表示赞成苏联的建议时，美国代表终于发言了。我感到很遗憾的是他没有结束自己的发言。美国代表大肆诽谤社会主义国家，这引起了这些国家代表的强烈抗议。罗马尼亚代表米辛契斯库同志走上讲台对美国人进行了应有的驳斥。他要求大会主席博兰不允许进行侮辱。于是出现了一种十分可笑的场面。会议主席过于热心了，他没有估计到，他的主要工具——小锤子会不顺心，他用它敲桌子时用力过猛，以至小锤子被打成碎块了。在主席失去了包含在小锤子里面的权利的象征以后，他就急忙宣布休会了。
    可惜，会议收场了。我想，美国代表也许以支持殖民主义国家来结束他的讲话。但是，过了一个夜晚，显然，这个夜晚是在思索中渡过的，美国人思索之后作出结论，必须选择害处较小的办法。显然，直截了当地、公然地支持英国、西班牙、葡萄牙和法国殖民主义者，就意味着暴露了自己。所以美国人决定做得高明些，支持苏联和反对殖民主义制度的国家的建议。再次发言的英国代表也不得不装出样子，好像他欢迎这个问题在全体会议上进行讨论。
    关于把这个问题提交联合国大会全体会议进行讨论，做出了一致拥护的决定，这是为消灭殖民主义制度而斗争的力量的巨大胜利。
    但是，我要提醒一下：如果谁把帝国主义国家的投票信以为真，那就是太天真了。可以说，全体一致的表决是在绝大多数的压力下，从殖民主义者那里取得的。帝国主义国家的代表决定赞成把这个问题提交全体会议讨论，但是，这还不是实质的解决。在这个问题上同殖民主义者取得实质上的一致，过去没有过，将来也不会有。
    我们主张彻底地、毫不迟延地消灭可耻的殖民主义制度，主张谴责既往和现今的殖民主义，主张使殖民主义制度今后不在任何地方以任何形式出现。
    帝国主义者企图“美化”殖民主义政策，他们甚至不反对谈论给予摆脱了殖民压迫的国家以援助。但是，这是什么“援助”呢？以美国总统在联大会议上的演说来说，在这篇演说中，没有任何建设性的建议。总统说，美国愿意为联合国的计划提供一亿美元，作为对获得了独立的非洲国家的援助。但是，如果把这笔钱拿来按照获得独立的非洲国家人口来分摊，那么每人得到五角五分钱。这些钱还不够闲逛用的，在美国还买不到两盒纸烟。
    帝国主义者过去掠夺、今后还想掠夺非洲国家，而现在却拿出点小恩小惠。拿走的是一块钱，而拿出来的是一分钱。他们给些小恩小惠，正像富农在圣诞节给受他无情地剥削一整年的雇农五个戈比一样，或是像一个资本家给整个企业一桶伏特加酒一样。
    帝国主义者在口头上可能主张承认解放殖民地人民的必要性，但是，他们更愿提出旷日持久地拖延赋予殖民地国家人民自由和独立的计划。他们用以掩饰的是：干部没有培养好、人民没有受过教育、没有实行自决的准备，以及其他奴隶贩子的“理论”。
    你们听听，一个年轻的非洲国家的代表对殖民主义者这种臆测回答得多好。他说：
    请你们相信，人会走路的，粉碎套在他们身上的锁链吧！
    真正站在谴责殖民主义、解放殖民地人民立场上的各国人民，都应该坚决地争取立即彻底停止殖民主义奴役，必须大声疾呼反对殖民主义者，揭穿他们的阴谋，不管这种阴谋是怎样伪装起来的。
    因为殖民主义者反对给予殖民地人民独立，所以被压迫的人民加紧争取自己解放的斗争是很自然的。而且他们正在获得自己的自由！毫无疑问，热爱自由的各国人民将向那些在同殖民主义者和扼杀人民自由的刽子手进行斗争的人们伸出援助的手。任何东西都防止不了历史注定要灭亡的殖民主义制度的崩溃。殖民主义的丧钟已经响起来了，殖民地人民一定会得到自由！
    同志们！阿尔及利亚问题是消灭殖民主义制度问题的重要组成部分，但是，这个问题在大会上将作为议程上的单独问题加以讨论。
    六年多来，阿尔及利亚人民进行着争取摆脱外国压迫的英勇的战争。法国殖民主义者企图用火和剑来镇压阿尔及利亚人对自由和独立的愿望。但是，他们过去不能、现在也不能摧毁为自己自由而奋战的人民的意志。阿尔及利亚人民的儿女的崇高斗争，获得越来越多的国际上的承认和支持。在法国本土，真正的法国爱国人士积极反对在阿尔及利亚进行殖民主义战争的运动正在扩大。
    阿尔及利亚问题曾经在大会上多次讨论过，但是，每一次殖民主义者都使讨论得出对阿尔及利亚人民没有实际帮助的、意义不大的决议。法国殖民主义者在它的同盟国的支持下，首先是在美国和英国的支持下，在讨论这个问题时，简直以胜利者的姿态出现。这次，在大会上的斗争要尖锐得多，殖民主义者要想再获得一个毫无意义的决议，那是更加困难了。
    苏联在阿尔及利亚问题上抱什么态度呢？我们的态度是非常鲜明的。我们一贯主张各国人民的自决，主张每一国家的人民自己决定本国的社会和政治结构。对于阿尔及利亚也完全如此。
    我们不止一次地向法国代表谈过我们对这个问题的观点。我记起同前法国总理摩勒和外交部长比诺在他们1956年5月访问苏联时的交谈。当时我们向法国人士说，如果你们不考虑在越南所得到的教训，那末，就毫无疑问走不出在阿尔及利亚陷入的死胡同。对你们唯一的出路就是承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决权。只有在这样基础上才能解决阿尔及利亚问题。
    摩勒和比诺表示，法国不能放弃阿尔及利亚，他们说那里住着二百万法国人。因此，按照他们的逻辑，仅此一点就足以认为，阿尔及利亚应该是法国的。我们对当时的法国政府的领导人回答说，你们谈到在阿尔及利亚有两百万法国人，而实际上那里没有那样多，但是，不能无视九百万阿尔及利亚人。
    我们竭力提醒我们的交谈者正确地理解这个问题。摩勒和比诺硬说，丧失阿尔及利亚有损于法国的尊严。我们向他们证明，法国的尊严不是体现在殖民主义的掠夺上，不是体现在镇压其他国家人民方面。但是，看来，殖民主义维护者不愿意考虑现实，因为，他们在继续奉行早已破产的政策。
    如果法国殖民主义者今后还不放弃用武力使阿尔及利亚继续成为它的殖民地的企图，那末，他们就会由于不可避免要发生的军事失败而失掉它。
    在戴高乐将军由于军事政变而上台以后不久，他发表谈话说，法国承认阿尔及利亚有自决权。但是后来在极端反动的殖民主义势力的压力下，他后退了，并谈论起自决权，但是，这里谈的是这样一种“自决”，即事先决定阿尔及利亚应当留在法国的版图内。最无耻的法国殖民主义者要求一体化，即完全吞并阿尔及利亚，想要消灭阿尔及利亚人的阿尔及利亚，把它变成法国在北非的一个省。
    苏联和社会主义国家的人民，坚决遵循着列宁的遗训：即每个民族都应当有自决权和按照自己的愿望组织国家的权利。因此我们的同情、我们的支持是在正在为从殖民主义压迫下获得解放而进行正义战争的阿尔及利亚人民的一边。
    战争有各种各样的战争。我们反对类似法国殖民主义者现在在阿尔及利亚进行的那种掠夺性的帝国主义战争。但是，我们承认和支持各国人民争取自身解放的正义战争。既然，殖民主义者自己不退出殖民地，那末，被奴役国家的人民就起来斗争，来把殖民主义者从自己的国家抛出去。如果必要的话，他们将不惜拿起武器来争取自己的自由和独立。阿尔及利亚的爱国者现在进行的正是这种斗争，我们祝他们成功。
    我们已经谈到苏联在事实上承认阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府，现在我们愿意重申一下自己的话。这个政府赢得了包括法国在内的全世界的承认。法国政府不止一次地同阿尔及利亚共和国政府接触和谈判。现在到处都把阿尔及利亚共和国政府看作是阿尔及利亚人民的代表，看作是阿尔及利亚人民在为民族自由和独立而斗争中的领导者。
    大会还通过了在全体会议上讨论刚果问题的决定。苏联代表团、其他社会主义国家的代表团以及亚非国家的很多代表在大会上的发言中，对于刚果所形成的局势和联合国秘书长在那里扮演的不体面的角色，给予了正确的评价。
    联合国由于联合国秘书处在秘书长哈马舍尔德领导下在刚果实行的政策而蒙受的耻辱，是洗刷不掉的。由于哈马舍尔德先生和他的代表的活动，刚果人民选举的合法议会和议会根据宪法建立的以卢蒙巴先生为首的政府，被瓦解和处于瘫痪状态。哈马舍尔德先生派到刚果去的这些代表是什么人呢？这就是科迪埃先生和本奇先生。这两个人都是美国人。但是，这是毫不令人惊奇的，因为哈马舍尔德先生本人也就是美国垄断资本的仆从。因此，美国国务卿赫脱先生把一张五百万美元的支票交给哈马舍尔德先生，供他在刚果随意使用，来完成肮脏的勾当，以及在隐蔽的形式下恢复比利时殖民主义者时代在那里所存在过的秩序，这不是偶然的。
    事态的发展对刚果人民来说是悲惨的，但是这却撕下了帝国主义者—殖民主义者以及那些为他们服务的人的假面具，撕下了联合国秘书长的假面具。现在所有的人都看到，他实行着反动的殖民主义者的政策，代表着以美国为首的帝国主义国家集团的利益。刚果的事态将促进殖民地人民的成熟，帮助他们更好地了解到谁是他们的朋友，谁是他们的敌人。
    而殖民主义者的政策将遭到破产，这是没有疑问的。刚果共和国坚定地立定脚跟和巩固地保障自己独立的日子一定会到来。刚果人民继续进行的忘我斗争就是保证，他们将把这个斗争进行到胜利为止。社会主义国家、一切爱好自由的人民都站在正在进行斗争的殖民地人民一边，站在正在进行斗争的刚果人民这一边。同志们！在我们代表团乘坐“波罗的海号”前往美国海岸和我们在纽约的全部时间里，我们始终感到苏联人、我们伟大的苏维埃祖国的关怀和支持。
    我们收到全国各个角落寄来的数以千计的信件和电报，这些都是来自企业、集体农庄、科学机关、党组织、苏维埃机构、工会和共青团组织的信件，来自很多工人、苏联农民和脑力劳动者的信件。在这些信件中有着祝贺苏联代表团工作成功的最衷心的祝愿，并且表示相信，我们代表团将尽一切可能使联大会议加强各国人民的信心，使他们相信可以求得缓和国际紧张局势，可以使人类摆脱军备竞赛和可耻的殖民主义奴役。
    苏联人表示完全支持苏联政府的立场，对解决最重要的国际问题以造福渴望和平、安宁以及自己和后代幸福的各国人民，表示了深切的关心。
    所有这些诚意的信件给了我们更大的信心，鼓舞我们为加强世界和平、争取现代最迫切、最切身重要的问题得到解决而斗争。
    请允许我代表我们党中央委员会，代表苏联政府，并以我个人的名义向劳动人民集体、向全体苏联人表示热烈的感谢，感谢他们的善良愿望。
    我们代表团还接到数千封来自国外的信件和电报，祝我们有利于和平的工作得到成功。许多信件和电报是美国人寄来的，他们也表示希望我们人民之间能达到更好的相互谅解，希望能加强世界和平。
    请允许我感谢所有我们的外国朋友，感谢他们热烈的祝愿，感谢他们对我国参加联大第十五届会议的代表团的工作的支持。
    我想热烈感谢“波罗的海号”透平电动机船上以船长马伊奥罗夫为首的全体船员，感谢“图—114”飞机的全体乘务员和机长维特科夫斯基，感谢他们优良的工作和出色地执行了他们的职务。我们乘“波罗的海号”横渡大西洋抵达纽约，而“图—114”飞机在十小时内把我们带回到亲爱的莫斯科。
    我们乘“波罗的海号”在海洋上航行了十昼夜，而从纽约回莫斯科时乘“图—114”飞机总共只花了十小时，这就是技术！不同的水平，不同的可能性！
    苏联代表团在联合国大会上对自己的任务完成得怎样，这要由苏联人民来评定。我们力求光荣地、无愧地代表苏联的利益。我们没有白白地浪费了时间，因为我们清楚地知道，去纽约不是到岳母家去吃油饼，而是去工作。何况，美国政府不准备用面包和盐来欢迎我们，这一点你们从报纸上已经知道。但是，我们没有为此感到困窘，我们本着共产党人——世界和平保卫者的高度责任感和良心做了自己的事情。
    同志们，我想谈谈对纽约市的印象。这是一个很大的城市。高尔基称它为黄色魔鬼的城市。但是，自从高尔基到过那里以后已经过了五十多年，从那时起，纽约更加可厌了。它表现出资本主义的畸形和堕落。住在那里的人注定要永远受罪，闭锁在石头的袋子中。相当高的楼房常常拆掉，代之而起的是新的摩天楼。城市好像在往上爬。
    下面有些街道栽着树。但是，这些树得不到发展，它们枯萎，看样子就要死了。又栽了新的树代替它们，但是那些树也很快就要死了。
    看到那些失去童年欢乐的孩子特别可怜，因为他们不仅没有在每个生物都必须的新鲜空气中跑来跑去的机会，甚至在新鲜空气中散步的机会都没有。街道简直被大量的汽车塞满了。而大家知道，汽车是靠汽油开动的，因此整个空气都被搞坏了。总而言之，在这方面纽约是一个可怕的城市。
    对城市发展方向负责的人，没有能力制止城市的进一步畸形化，因为既不是国家、也不是政治活动家能决定城市应该怎样发展，这是每一个私有主的事，他们拥有自己的地盘。如果他愿意拆掉15—20层楼房，而在热闹地方建造40—60层楼房或甚至一百层楼房，他就可以拆掉旧的房子和建造新的房子。
    在这个黄色魔鬼的城市中，主要的不是人，而是美元。每个人都想怎么才能获得更多的收入、更多的美元。在那里注意的中心不是人的生活，而是利润和追求资本。
    城市建设的资本主义方向很少考虑到人们的生活需要。我不由得自豪地把这种情况同我们的、社会主义的城市建设发展相比较。在我们这里，城市的计划和建设是服从于人的，服从于对人的关怀和创造种种方便的。
    回到祖国，回到莫斯科以后，我简直就享受着我们的人所呼吸的新鲜空气。我们的首都是一个美好的城市，特别是现在，当它正在改建、正在建造新的街区的时候。莫斯科正在成为更加美丽的城市，它有着设备完善的房子，有宽阔的街道、广场、充满绿荫的街心花园，有供儿童游玩的场地，有水池和许许多多的树木。同志们，我已经说过，目前状态下的联合国是辜负了各国人民对于避免战争威胁和避免军备竞赛的期望的。但是，我们相信，健康的思想必将胜利，真理必将胜利，善良的种子将长出茁壮的幼芽。那些政府在人民的压力下将理解到各国和平共处的必要性和相信必须在严格的国际监督下实现全面彻底裁军，这样的时刻一定会到来，而且为期不远。我们这方面将尽一切努力使联合国根据时代的要求加以改组，使它成为一个真正的、普遍性的普遍和平的工具。
    应该承认，国际局势仍然是紧张的。美国侵略集团没有放弃他们的侵略行动，没有放弃它们的飞机在别国领土上空的挑衅性飞行，首先是在苏联上空的挑衅性飞行。你们知道，我们把关于美国对苏联的侵略行动的问题提交联合国大会讨论。这个问题列入了议程。
    不久前，报刊上有消息说，五角大楼决定派遣装备有火箭和核武器的潜水艇到苏联沿岸附近巡逻。
    美国的陆海军将领们不能不知道，我国也有装备着火箭的原子发动机的潜水艇。如果我们也走上这条道路，如果我们的潜水艇也在美国海岸巡游，那么将会发生什么事情呢？
    这是杜勒斯宣布的罪恶的“战争边缘政策”，他的追随者正在奉行着这种政策。这是“冷战”的道路，它可以变成热战。
    最近以来，我们同美国的关系恶化了，而这不是由于我们的过错。
    但是，无论现在我们同美国的关系多么冷淡，我们将继续执行列宁的和平共处政策。我们相信，我们两国之间、我们两国人民之间、我们两国政府之间的关系得到改善的时刻终会到来的。
    但是要使这个时间日益临近，要打掉五角大楼和美国侵略集团对苏联进行挑衅的嗜好，就必须使我们的经济高速度地发展，使我们的科学达到应有的水平，使我们的军队具有最现代化的武装。
    必须尽一切力量，一往直前地提高劳动生产率，保证经济、科学、文化的发展，提高人民生活水平，以便在同资本主义和平竞赛的实践中显示出社会主义的伟大优越性和马克思列宁主义学说的伟大力量。
    中央统计局不久前发表的关于今年头九个月国民经济计划执行情况的公报，非常令人信服地说明，我们国内事情进行得多么顺利。这种结果使苏联人——不倦的共产主义建设者心里感到喜悦，并且使我们的外国朋友感到鼓舞。
    高速发展着的社会主义工业年年都大大地超额完成计划任务。今年，工业产品增长额将超过一千四百亿卢布。应当说，仅在几年以前，在改组工业管理前，工业产品年增长额大约为一千亿卢布。
    也许，你们还记得，在1946年初，党在制定战后我国经济发展计划时曾经提出了使工业产品增加两倍的任务，使钢和石油的年产量达到各为六千万吨。据推测，要完成拟定的计划需要十五年，或者更多的时间。
    苏联人民是怎样地完成了这一任务呢？十五年过去了，我国工业产品的产量不是增加了两倍，而是五倍。现在，苏联年产六千五百万吨钢，一亿四千五百万吨以上的石油。我国的农业正在同样顺利地发展，文化建设也在顺利地进行。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府特别重视培养熟练的干部。我国在培养干部方面所取得的成就震惊全世界。社会主义的敌人甚至不惜臆造出荒谬的神话。说什么苏联的工程师、科学家、医生、教师越多，我们在前进中所遇到的困难就会越大。好吧！我们勇敢地迎接这些“困难”吧。
    请允许我列举一些极有说服力的材料：在1926年，当把我国经济恢复到革命前的水平的工作结束时，苏联共有十六万八千名高等学校学生和只有二百五十万多一点的脑力劳动者。在去年，我国约有二百二十万名大学生，即增加了十二倍，而脑力劳动者现在超过了两千万人，增加了七倍。其中，工程师、技术员和农学家的数量增加了十七倍，科学工作者增加了二十二倍。
    在从事体力劳动的人们中间，受过中等和高等教育的人数大大增加了。革命前，在工人和农民中间没有受过中等教育的人，更没有受过高等教育的人，而现在，根据最近的调查数字，在苏联从事体力劳动的公民中间，有32％的人受过中等教育乃至高等教育，这些人在工人中间占39％，在集体农民中间占21％。
    这样，在苏维埃政权的年代里，我国有一支拥有两千多万脑力劳动者——与工农血肉相连的、真正的人民知识分子的队伍成长起来了。尤其值得注意的是，将近三分之一的苏维埃体力劳动者，其中包括五分之二的工人和五分之一以上的集体农庄庄员，具有中等乃至高等文化程度。
    所有这一切令人信服地说明，我们在逐步消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的根本差别方面已取得极明显的成绩。
    还可以列举许多其他这样令人信服的例子，来证明满怀信心地朝着伟大目标——共产主义前进的我们祖国所取得的卓越成就。
    亲爱的同志们！再过两个多星期，我和你们就要庆祝十月社会主义革命——人类历史上最伟大的革命四十三周年了。
    我们愉快而喜悦地看到，苏联人民——新世界、即共产主义世界的伟大建设者在自己亲爱的共产党领导之下获得了巨大的成就。
    我们忠实于马克思列宁主义战无不胜的学说，勇往前进。世界上没有一种力量能阻挡各国人民走向光明的目标。
    我们列宁主义的共产党——共产主义建设的鼓舞者和组织者万岁！
    我们的社会主义祖国——整个进步人类的光荣和骄傲万岁！
    强大的社会主义国家阵营万岁！
    世界持久和平万岁！
