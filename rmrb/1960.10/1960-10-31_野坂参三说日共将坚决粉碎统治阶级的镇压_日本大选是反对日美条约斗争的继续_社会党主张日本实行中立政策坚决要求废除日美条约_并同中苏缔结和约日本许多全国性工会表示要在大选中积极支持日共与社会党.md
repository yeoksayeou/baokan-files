Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th - Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzō Nosaka said in a statement published in the "Akahata" newspaper today on the issue of the general election, that the Japanese Communist Party will take advantage of the favorable situation of doubling the party's strength to resolutely crush the ruling class's destructive conspiracies and suppression, and strive for victory in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the establishment of a democratic coalition government. Nosaka pointed out that this general election is a continuation and development of the struggle against the "Security Treaty." Therefore, the biggest focus of the general election must be the "Security Treaty" issue.
    Sanzō Nosaka also severely refuted various fallacies of the Liberal Democratic Party representative at a symposium of representatives of four parties convened by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation yesterday. He emphasized that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will strengthen Japan's militarism and fascist politics.
    He also pointed out that the terrorist act of assassinating Socialist Party Chairman Inejirō Asanuma is a manifestation of the militarist and fascist countercurrent, which cannot be separated from the "Security Treaty."
    At this symposium attended by representatives from the Liberal Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party, Shigeru Hori, representative of the Liberal Democratic Party, emphasized that the "Security Treaty" issue should not be debated in depth in the upcoming general election. He said that the treaty had already been reviewed in the Diet, and further in-depth debates in the general election would turn into an "endless dispute."
    Nosaka pointed out that the Japanese people still have questions about the content and impact of the treaty, but it was not carefully reviewed in the Diet at all. He said that the government and the ruling party are saying that the issue has been resolved in this general election. This is an unacceptable undemocratic practice.
    At the symposium, Nosaka also exposed the deceptive remarks of Liberal Democratic Party representative Shigeru Hori that they also advocated "independent foreign policy." Nosaka said that the Liberal Democratic Party and the current government have not adopted this policy. He pointed out, "Post-war Japan was under American occupation, and although the form has changed, there are still (American) military bases in Japan and American troops are still in Japan. Under these circumstances, can it be said that (Japan) is independent!"
    Regarding the issue of neutrality, Nosaka said that implementing a neutral policy is what the Japanese people demand. He said that socialist countries already have one billion people, accounting for one-third of the world's population. In addition, many colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia and Africa have also become independent and are pursuing a neutral policy. An international force capable of overwhelming imperialism has already been formed. He said, we believe that Japan's direction is to take the road of neutrality. In other words, it is to prevent Japan from participating in any military alliances and to establish friendly relations with all countries.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - Kiyoshi Katsumada, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party, reiterated at a policy debate with Foreign Minister Kosaka and others that the Socialist Party firmly advocates that Japan implement a neutral foreign policy and abolish the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.
    The director of the Socialist Party's Education and Propaganda Bureau expressed this position at a symposium on the policies of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party, hosted by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation on the 27th and 28th.
    Kiyoshi Katsumada said at the meeting that the Socialist Party advocates implementing neutral diplomacy. He said that the Socialist Party believes that "the unreasonable (Japan-U.S.) Security Treaty should be abolished as soon as possible through diplomatic channels, backed by national opinion."
    Katsumada also stated that the Socialist Party advocates concluding non-aggression pacts with relevant countries and establishing an Asian peace guarantee system including the United States, the Soviet Union, and China. He said that of course, active efforts should be made to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia and the Pacific.
    Regarding relations with China and the Soviet Union, he said: "The issue of concluding peace treaties with the Soviet Union and China and normalizing diplomatic relations cannot be ignored for a single day." He said that the Socialist Party's foreign policy towards China is to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations and conclude a peace treaty based on the following point of view, "that Taiwan is (China's) internal affair, there is only one China, and recognition and support for the People's Republic of China."
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - An increasing number of national trade unions in Japan have expressed their intention to support the Communist Party in the general election.
    According to a report in today's "Akahata" newspaper, the All Japan Metal Workers' Union, the Japan Federation of Pulp Industry Workers' Unions, the All Japan Federation of Printing and Publishing Industry Workers' Unions, the National Passenger Automobile Workers' Union, the Temporary Workers' Union, the National Tax Officials' Union, the All-Agriculture and Forestry Ministry Workers' Union, the National Customs Union, and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry Employees' Union have all decided to support the Communist Party and the Socialist Party in the general election. They all belong to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan. The Niigata, Hokuriku, Osaka, and Hiroshima branches of the National Railway Workers' Union have also decided to support the Communist Party and the Socialist Party.
    At yesterday's national convention, the All Japan Non-Life Insurance Workers' Union of the Federation of Independent Unions passed a resolution expressing its intention to support the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.
    According to the "Akahata" newspaper, the number of workers supporting the Communist Party is also increasing in the various unions belonging to the All Japan Trade Union Conference, which supports the Democratic Socialist Party.

    野坂参三说日共将坚决粉碎统治阶级的镇压
    日本大选是反对日美条约斗争的继续
    社会党主张日本实行中立政策坚决要求废除日美条约
    并同中苏缔结和约日本许多全国性工会表示要在大选中积极支持日共与社会党
    据新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本共产党主席野坂参三今天在
  “赤旗报”上就大选问题发表的谈话中说，日共将乘党的力量加强一倍的有利形势，坚决粉碎统治阶级的破坏阴谋和镇压，为争取反对日美“安全条约”斗争的胜利、争取建立民主联合政府而奋斗。野坂指出，这次大选是反对“安全条约”斗争的继续和发展。因此大选的最大焦点必须是“安全条约”问题。
    野坂参三昨天还在日本广播协会召集的四党代表座谈会上，严厉驳斥了自由民主党代表的各种谬论。他强调指出，新日美“安全条约”将加强日本的军国主义和法西斯政治。
    他并且指出，杀害社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎的恐怖行为就是军国主义和法西斯主义逆流的一种表现，这是不能同“安全条约”分开的。
    在这个有自由民主党、社会党、共产党、民主社会党代表参加的座谈会上，自由民主党代表保利茂强调在即将举行的大选中不要深入地辩论“安全条约”问题。他说什么在国会中已经审议了这个条约，如果再在大选中深入辩论就会变成“无休止的争论”。
    野坂指出，日本人民对这个条约的内容及其影响等还存在着疑问，但是在国会里根本没有慎重地进行审议。他说，政府和执政党在这次大选时却说这个问题已经解决。这是不能容忍的不民主的做法。
    野坂在座谈会上还揭露了自由民主党代表保利茂说他们也主张采取“自主独立的外交政策”的欺骗言论。野坂说，自由民主党和现在的政府并没有采取这种政策。他指出，“战后日本处在美国的占领之下，虽然形式上有变化，但目前（美国）在日本还有军事基地，美国的军队还在日本。在这种情况下，能说（日本）是独立的吗！”
    谈到中立问题时，野坂说，实行中立政策是日本人民所要求的。他说，社会主义的国家已经有十亿人口，即占全世界人口的三分之一了。另外，亚洲、非洲的许多殖民地、半殖民地国家也都已经独立，并正在推行中立政策。国际上已经形成了能够压倒帝国主义的力量。他说，我们认为日本的方向是走中立的道路。换言之，就是使日本不参加任何军事同盟，同一切国家建立友好关系。
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本社会党中央执行委员胜间田清一在同外务相小坂等举行的政策辩论会上重申社会党坚决主张日本实行中立外交政策，废除日美军事同盟条约。
    这位社会党教育宣传局长是在日本广播协会于27、8两日主持举行的一次自由民主党、社会党、民主社会党三党政策座谈会上表示这种立场的。
    胜间田清一在会上说，社会党主张实行中立外交。他说，社会党认为，“应该以国民舆论为背景，通过外交途径，及早废除无理的（日美）安全条约”。
    胜间田还表示社会党主张同有关国家缔结互不侵犯协定，建立包括美国、苏联、中国在内的亚洲和平保障体制。他说，对于在亚洲和太平洋建立无原子武器区，当然要积极地进行努力。
    关于同中苏的关系，他说：“同苏联、中国缔结和约和邦交正常化问题一天也不能加以忽视”。他说，社会党对中国的外交方针是，根据如下观点来恢复日中邦交和缔结和约，“即台湾是（中国）内政问题，中国只有一个，承认和支持中华人民共和国”。
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本越来越多的全国性工会表示要在大选中支持共产党。
    据“赤旗报”今天报道，已经作出决定要在大选中支持共产党和社会党的有全国金属工会、全国纸浆产业工会联合会、全国印刷出版产业工会总联合会、全国旅客汽车工会、临时工工会、全国税职员工会、全农林省工会、全国关税工会、通商产业省职员工会。它们全都是属于日本工会总评议会的。国营铁道工会新潟、北陆、大阪和广岛的分会，也都决定支持共产党和社会党。
    中立工会联合会中的全日本损害保险工会在昨天的全国代表大会上通过决议，表示要支持社会党和共产党两个政党。
    据“赤旗报”报道，在支持民主社会党的全日本工会会议所属各工会中，支持共产党的工人也在增加。
