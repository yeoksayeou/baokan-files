    The Party Branch Secretary's Sunday
    Li Houcheng, the Party branch secretary of our fourth workshop, has his home in the countryside, and he hasn't been home for one or two years. Recently, one Sunday, he planned to go home for a visit.

    As he passed through Chenzhuang Commune, he suddenly heard two young people talking: "Our flour mill hasn't been working for a whole day." "Probably something is wrong with the generator." Secretary Li heard this and interjected, "Do you have an electrician in your commune?" The young people replied: "Yes, but he went to another place to buy electrical materials." Secretary Li said, "I am an electrician. Let's see if I can help you fix it." The two young people immediately said in unison: "That's great, we welcome it."

    Secretary Li carefully inspected the generator and found that there was a problem with the brushes. However, the commune did not have these accessories at the time. In order not to affect the commune's flour processing task, Secretary Li decided to temporarily lend them the spare brushes from our factory.

    In the evening, when Secretary Li took the brushes from the factory to the commune, the commune cadres said with emotion: "We really don't know how to thank you for helping us like this!" Secretary Li replied with a smile: "We are all one family, no need to thank me!"

    支部书记的星期天
    我们四车间的党支部书记李厚成家在农村，他已一、二年没有回过家。最近一个星期天，他打算回家看看。
    当他路过陈庄公社的时候，忽然听到两个青年人在谈论：“我们的面粉加工厂已经整整一天没有开工了。”“可能是发电机有毛病。”李书记听了就插嘴说：“你们社里有没有电工？”青年人回答：
  “有，但是到外地买电气材料去了。”李书记说：“我就是电工，看能不能帮你们修一修。”两个青年听了马上异口同声地说：“这太好了，我们欢迎。”
    李书记伏在发电机上仔细一检查，发现是电刷子有毛病。但公社当时没有这种配件。为了不让公社的面粉加工任务受影响，李书记决定先将我们厂备用的电刷子暂时借给他们。
    傍晚时，李书记从工厂把电刷子拿到公社去的时候、公社的干部们感动地说：“您这样帮助我们，我们真不知如何感谢才好！”李书记笑着回答：“我们都是一家人，还谢干啥！”
