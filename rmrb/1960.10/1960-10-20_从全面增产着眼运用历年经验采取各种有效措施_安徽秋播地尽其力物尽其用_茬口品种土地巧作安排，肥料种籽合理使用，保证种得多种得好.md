(Our Hefei dispatch, October 19th) Anhui Province, in this year's autumn planting, is summarizing and applying the experiences of the past few years, implementing the policy of multiple high-yield and high-income crops. Targeting the characteristics of various crops, the province has cleverly arranged crop rotations and land use and is carefully planning fertilizer and seed use, so that land is used to its full potential, resources are used to the maximum, and no time is lost. These measures have allowed the province to take the initiative in the three-autumn work, ensuring that autumn-sown crops can be planted more extensively and well.

The broad masses of commune members in Anhui Province have accumulated considerable experience in the struggle for agricultural production since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward. Under the call of the Party Central Committee to "vigorously develop agriculture and grain production," all parts of Anhui have used the "three-way combination" method of leading cadres, scientific and technical personnel, and farmers to systematically summarize these experiences. And from the perspective of comprehensive increase in production, they have adopted various effective measures targeting the biological characteristics of crops.

First, planting is done according to soil type and variety, with rational layout. Experience in various places has proven that crops such as rapeseed and wheat are fertilizer-tolerant, while barley is relatively tolerant of poor soil. When planted on poor soil under the same conditions as wheat, barley yields much higher than wheat. Conversely, if planted on fertile soil, barley yields lower than wheat. Last year, the JinDian Brigade of the XiaTang Commune in Shou County planted 1.4 mu of barley and 2.3 mu of wheat on fertile land. Under the same management conditions, the barley yield was 185 jin per mu, while the wheat yield reached 287 jin per mu. Therefore, this year, many communes in Anhui, through soil surveys, have attached great importance to the rational layout of crops according to soil and variety. In this year's autumn planting, the LaoGuanChen Production Team of the NanPing Commune in QuanJiao County planted 340 mu of relatively fertile land with good drainage with "QuanJiao No. 1" wheat, which requires more fertilizer and has a longer growing period; the 170 mu of hardpan land was planted with barley, which is tolerant of poor soil and has a shorter growing period. In this year's autumn planting, the XiaTang Commune in Shou County, in order to plant according to the soil type, readjusted improperly arranged crops, totaling more than 48,000 mu. This single measure is expected to increase grain production by more than 2 million jin next summer.

Second, multiple varieties are matched, and crop rotations are rationally arranged. Autumn-sown crops have different suitable sowing periods; some are suitable for early sowing, and some are suitable for late sowing. Years of experience have proven that timely sowing is an important measure to strive for increased production. However, this year, under the circumstances of different crop rotations and tight labor, if a single variety or few varieties are adopted, it is easy to miss the agricultural season. This year, various parts of Anhui are using multiple early-maturing crops as the center, adopting the method of planting multiple varieties in staggered rows to lengthen the suitable period for sowing. This year, the ChaJian Commune in TianChang County summarized twelve varieties with different sowing periods, divided them into four categories, and planted them in different crop rotations. When the suitable sowing period for the first crop passed, they adopted the second crop; when the second crop's sowing period passed, they adopted the third crop. Therefore, this commune's early autumn crops were planted with winter-hardy early-maturing wheat such as "San Yue Huang" in mid-to-late September; the mid-autumn crops were planted with wheat such as "Ai Li Duo" and "He Shang Tou" in early October; the mid-to-late autumn crops that have just been vacated are currently being planted with good local varieties such as "Zi Gan Zi" and "Da Hong Mang"; as for the late autumn crops, arrangements have been made to plant spring-hardy wheat varieties such as "Nan Da Er Si Yi Jiu." In this way, the suitable sowing period for this autumn planting is half a month to twenty days longer than in previous years. Last year, due to the adoption of a single variety, late-stubble land could not be utilized, and the autumn planting area only accounted for 56% of the cultivated land. This year, as of the beginning of October, the autumn planting area in the commune has accounted for 69% of the cultivated land and is still continuing to be sown. This year, in order to plant more and better rapeseed, Anhui has adopted a revolutionary measure in rapeseed cultivation technology. The province has promoted the method of square-block seedling raising and transplanting of rapeseed, which greatly saves seeds, labor, pesticides, etc., and enables late-stubble rapeseed to be sown in a timely manner during the Autumn Equinox and Cold Dew periods. This year, ShuCheng County has widely promoted the method of square-block seedling raising of rapeseed, and has now completed more than 2,000 mu of seedling raising tasks.

Third, improve sowing quality and rational close planting. This year, the broad masses of cadres and commune members have a further understanding of the issue of close planting. Everyone understands that whether close planting is reasonable cannot be judged solely from the amount of sowing. The branching and tillering habits of various crops are different, so the degree of close planting must be determined according to their different habits. To ensure a certain number of basic seedlings and uniform and strong seedlings, the key is not in more seeds, but more importantly, under the condition of a certain amount of seeds, attention should be paid to planting methods and sowing quality. Based on past experience, this year Anhui, in implementing rational close planting, takes ensuring 200,000 basic wheat seedlings per mu as the standard, and adopted measures such as "scientific seed selection, timely early sowing, meticulous land preparation, seed dressing with pesticides, seed dressing with fertilizer, deep sowing and shallow covering, and even sowing" to control the amount of seeds used between 14 jin and 18 jin, so that the seedlings are complete and vigorous, saving seeds and achieving rational close planting requirements. The 1,900 mu of wheat that have been sown in the DongGuan Brigade of the SanBa Commune in Su County have been sown in accordance with the above standards. Together with the 400 mu to be sown, the total amount of seeds used is only more than 38,200 jin. In this way, the brigade planted 200 mu more than last year, but used 14,600 jin less seeds. According to experience, half of the sown wheat seedlings have emerged, and the number of basic seedlings generally reaches more than 210,000, and some reach 245,000.

Fourth, careful planning and economical fertilization. After summarizing and analyzing, various places know that the requirements of crops for fertilizer vary depending on the variety, time, and location. At the same time, because the supply of high-quality fertilizer in various places is not abundant, all places are doing economical fertilization according to the growth law and habits of crops, and using fertilizer wisely. For example, wheat is a crop that is "rich from the womb," so various places pay attention to applying sufficient base fertilizer; broad beans and pea crops have root nodules that can fix nitrogen, so as long as ash is used to cover the seeds to promote early root nodule growth, it can fix more nitrogen fertilizer to supply growth needs. In terms of fertilization timing, "water sprouts for wheat and flowers for vegetables," more water and manure should be applied to wheat seedlings; in terms of fertilization methods, "a large piece of manure is not as good as a line," concentrated fertilizer application is more conducive to crop root absorption. According to the characteristics of wheat being "rich from the womb," ShuCheng County has implemented the methods of "three fertilizers for sowing" (base fertilizer before sowing, watering fertilizer during sowing, and covering soil fertilizer after sowing) and "concentrated ditch application," which not only uses fertilizer economically, but also meets the growth needs of wheat seedlings. According to experiments, under the same conditions, only because of different fertilization methods, the use of "three fertilizers for sowing and concentrated ditch application" can increase production by nearly 30%. From the entire production process, labor and fertilizer are greatly saved. This year, ShuCheng County has widely adopted the method of "concentrated ditch application" in wheat sowing. Large-area high-yield fields adopt "three fertilizers for sowing," and general fields also do "two fertilizers for sowing," which greatly improves the quality of sowing. In addition, due to the mastery of the characteristics of various crops, Anhui Province has also promoted the method of mixed planting of peas and wheat on a large scale this year, using the nitrogen-fixing effect of legume root nodules to achieve the effect of saving fertilizer and increasing production.

By taking the above measures, various parts of Anhui Province have clearly seen its benefits in the autumn planting work: (1) It can not only sow in a timely manner, but also spend less labor; (2) It can not only plant fertile fields well, but also plant barren land well; (3) It can not only achieve rational close planting, but also save seeds; (4) It can not only strive for balanced increase in production, but also economize on fertilization. Because the autumn planting has mastered the crop rotation season, planting according to the local conditions and varieties, and implemented high-standard and high-specification planting, the autumn planting has met the requirements in terms of "planting well." At the same time, due to proper labor arrangements, and the savings in fertilizer and seeds, the needs of labor and materials after the expansion of the autumn planting area have been guaranteed, so that the autumn planting can be "planted more." As of mid-October, Anhui Province has planted 8 million mu of food crops, 1.47 million mu of rapeseed, and another 23,000 mu have been used for square-block seedling raising, and 1.2 million mu of green manure have also been planted.

    从全面增产着眼运用历年经验采取各种有效措施
    安徽秋播地尽其力物尽其用
    茬口品种土地巧作安排，肥料种籽合理使用，保证种得多种得好
    本报合肥19日电　安徽省在今年秋种中，总结和运用过去几年的经验，贯彻多种高产多收的方针，针对农作物特性，对茬口、土地巧作安排，对肥料、种子精打细算，使地尽其力，物尽其用，不失时机，在三秋工作中争得了主动，保证了秋种作物能多种、种好。
    安徽省广大公社社员，解放以来特别是大跃进以来，在农业生产的斗争中，积累了不少经验。在党中央“大办农业、大办粮食”的号召下，安徽各地都运用了领导干部、科学技术人员和农民“三结合”的方法，系统地总结了这些经验。并且从全面增产着眼，针对农作物的生物学特性，采取了各种有效措施。
    第一，因土质、因品种种植，合理布局。各地经验证明，油菜、小麦等作物是耐肥的作物，而大麦则是比较耐瘠的作物。在地力差的土地上，它和小麦在同样条件下种植，产量比小麦高得多，反过来，如同时种在肥力强的土地上，产量又比小麦低得多。寿县下塘公社金店大队，去年在肥力强的土地上种植一点四亩大麦和二点三亩小麦，在同样管理条件下，结果大麦亩产量一百八十五斤，小麦亩产量却达二百八十七斤。因之，今年安徽的许多公社，通过对土壤地块调查，都十分重视作物的因土、因种合理布局。全椒县南屏公社老观陈生产队，今年秋种中，就把三百四十亩土质较肥、排水较好的土地，种上了需肥多、生长期较长的“全椒一号”小麦；土质较差的一百七十亩板冲田，种上了耐瘠、生长期短的大麦。寿县下塘公社今年秋种中，为了做到因土种植，把原来安排不当的作物，重新进行调整，共调整四万八千多亩，仅此一项措施，预计明年夏季就可多收粮食二百万斤以上。
    第二，多品种搭配，合理安排茬口。秋种作物的适宜播种期各不相同，有的宜早，有的宜迟。历年经验证明，适时播种，是争取增产的一项重要措施。但是，今年各地在茬口不一、劳力紧张的情况下，如果采取单一品种或品种较少，就容易贻误农时。安徽各地今年以多种早熟作物为中心，采用多品种排开种植的办法，拉长了播种的适时期限。天长县汊涧公社今年总结了十二个播种期先后不同的品种，划分四类，在不同茬口搭配种植，第一种作物的播种适宜期过去了，就采用第二种，第二种播种期过去了，就采用第三种。因此，这个公社的早秋茬，已在9月中下旬种上了“三月黄”等冬性强的早熟麦；中秋茬，在10月初种上了“矮粒多”“和尚头”等小麦；刚刚腾出的中晚秋茬，当前正种“紫秆子”“大红芒”等农家良种；至于晚秋茬，现已安排好种“南大二四一九”等春性强的小麦品种。这样一来，这个秋种的适宜播种期，就比往年拉长了半个月到二十天。去年这个社由于采用单一化品种，晚茬地不能利用，秋种面积只占耕地56％，今年到10月上旬止，全社秋种面积已占耕地69％，并且还在继续播种中。安徽今年为了多种种好油菜，在油菜栽培技术上采取了一项革命性的措施，全省推广了油菜方块育苗移栽办法，大大节约了种籽，节约了劳力、农药等，并使晚茬田的油菜能在秋分寒露期间适时下种。舒城县今年普遍推广了油菜方块育苗办法，现在已完成二千多亩的育苗任务。
    第三，提高播种质量，合理密植。今年广大干部和公社社员，对密植问题有了更进一步的认识，人人都懂得了密植是否合理，不能完全从播种量来看。各种农作物的分枝、分蘖习性各有不同，所以必须根据它们的不同习性确定密植程度；要保证一定的基本苗数和苗匀苗壮，也不在种子多，更重要的是在一定种子量的条件下，讲究种植方法和播种的质量。根据过去的经验，安徽今年在贯彻合理密植上，以保证小麦基本苗二十万株为标准，采取了“科学选种，适时早播，精细整地，药剂拌种，拌肥下种，深播浅盖，下种均匀”等办法，控制用种量在十四斤到十八斤之间，使苗全苗旺，既节约了用种，又达到合理密植的要求。宿县三八公社东关大队已播的一千九百亩小麦，都按照以上标准播种，再加上待播的四百亩，合计不过用种三万八千二百多斤。这样，这个大队比去年多种二百亩，种子却少用一万四千六百斤。经验查，已播的小麦有一半苗已出土，基本苗数一般达到二十一万株以上，有的达到二十四万五千株。
    第四，精打细算，经济施肥。各地经过总结分析，知道农作物对肥料的要求，是因品种、因时、因地而不同的。同时，由于各地优质肥料还不充裕，所以各地都根据作物的生长规律和习性，做到经济施肥，把肥料用在刀口上。比如小麦是“胎里富”的庄稼，各地就注意施足基肥；蚕豆、豌豆作物生有根瘤，能起固氮作用，只要用灰盖种，促使早生根瘤，就能多固定氮肥供应生长需要。在施肥时机上，“麦浇芽子菜浇花”，小麦苗期多浇水粪；在施肥方法上，“上粪一大片，不如一条线”，肥料施得集中，更有利于作物根部吸收。舒城县根据小麦“胎里富”的特点，实行了“三肥下种”（种前垫底肥、种时浇水肥、种后盖土肥）、“集中沟施”的方法，既经济用肥，又能满足小麦苗期的生长需要。根据试验，在同样条件下，仅因施肥方法不同，采用“三肥下种、集中沟施”，就可增产近30％，从整个生产过程来算，劳力、肥料都有很大节省。今年舒城县在小麦播种中，普遍采用“集中沟施”的用肥方法，大面积丰产田采用“三肥下种”，一般田也做到“两肥下种”，大大提高了播种质量。此外，由于掌握了各种作物的特性，安徽省今年还大面积地推行了豌豆小麦混种的办法，利用豆类作物根瘤固氮的作用，以收到省肥增产的效果。
    安徽省各地采取以上各项措施，在秋种工作中，已明显地看到了它的好处：（1）既能播种适时，又花劳力较少；（2）既种好了肥田，又种好瘠地；（3）既合理密植，又节约了用种；（4）既争取平衡增产，又经济施肥。由于秋种掌握了茬口季节，因地、因品种播种，实行了高标准，高规格的种植，这样使秋种在“种得好”方面达到了要求。同时，由于劳力安排得当，肥料种籽有了节约，又保证了秋种面积扩大后劳力物力的需要，使秋种能够“种得多”。到10月中旬，安徽全省已种粮食作物八百万亩，油菜一百四十七万亩，另有两万三千亩进行了方块育苗，绿肥也种了一百二十万亩。
