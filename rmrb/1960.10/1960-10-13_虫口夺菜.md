In Our Commune:

	Saving Vegetables from Pests
	More than 2,000 mu of white radishes in our commune have been infested with pests. Miao Ji'an, the first secretary of the Party committee, personally went to the fields to inspect and worked with experienced old farmers to find ways to eliminate the radish weevil.
	They discovered that the weevil's activity pattern is: in the larval stage, it first harms the radish leaves; in the later stage, it burrows into the radish heart and eats the young buds. In mild cases, production will be reduced by 30-50%, and in severe cases, the radish heart is eaten away, resulting in no harvest. After finding out the pattern and recognizing the seriousness of harming vegetables, the Party committee immediately called on the secretaries of the production brigades and production teams to take the lead and mobilize the commune members to take action together. The measures they adopted to eliminate the weevil were: 1. For weevils that harm the leaves, spray tobacco mixture or 666 powder in the morning when there is dew, once every three days, until they are completely eliminated; 2. For pests that have burrowed into the radish heart, use bamboo sticks to pick them out and kill them, or spray water boiled from the bark of the Melia azedarach tree and Ma Shan vines.
	Under the leadership of Dong Deqing, deputy secretary of the Party committee, the Gaotang Production Team has cured 23 mu of radishes infested with pests. More than 2,000 mu of radishes in the entire commune have been sprayed with medicine three to five times respectively, and the pest infestation has been basically eliminated.

    虫口夺菜
    我们公社有二千多亩白萝卜发生了虫害。党委第一书记苗纪安亲自到田间检查，和有经验的老农一起寻找除治萝卜剜心虫的办法。
    他们发现剜心虫的活动规律是：在幼虫期，先危害萝卜叶；后期钻进萝卜心，吃掉幼芽。轻的要减产三、五成，严重的萝卜心被吃掉，一无收成。找出了规律，认识到了危害蔬菜的严重性以后，党委立即号召各生产大队、生产小队书记挂帅，发动社员一齐行动起来。他们采取除治剜心虫的办法是：一、对危害叶部的剜心虫，在早晨有露水时，喷洒烟草合剂或六六六粉，三天一次，直到消灭干净为止；二、对钻进萝卜心的害虫，用竹签挑出杀死，或用苦楝树皮、马山条等熬成水喷洒。
    高堂生产队在党委副书记董德庆的带领下，已治好二十三亩发生虫害的萝卜。全社二千多亩萝卜，已经分别喷洒了药水三到五遍，虫害已基本消灭。河南舞阳县保和公社党委通讯组
