Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 18th: Hunan Province's winter planting work has been rapidly launched throughout the province. As of the 14th, the province has sown 28 million mu of winter crops such as wheat, barley, rapeseed, winter vegetables, green manure, and feed. Changde Prefecture, which has the fastest progress, has overfulfilled the winter planting plan.

Under the encouragement of the policy of the whole party and the whole people engaging in agriculture and grain production on a large scale, Hunan Province is focusing on winter crops with the same energy used for rice production. The planned area for winter crops in the province is significantly larger than last year. In order to seize the season quickly and effectively and rush to plant winter crops, Changde, Xiangtan, and other prefectures have adopted the method of launching mass movements, organizing evaluations and competitions between teams, groups, and individuals. In the race against time to plant green manure in Lixian County, a "three comparisons" (comparing the expanded planting area, progress, and quality) and a high-efficiency, high-quality competition between rivals were widely carried out between teams, groups, and individuals, which greatly accelerated the planting progress and ensured the planting quality. After the launch of the competition in Liyang Commune, the daily progress of green manure planting rapidly increased from more than 2,000 mu in the previous period to more than 4,000 mu. After the Guanwang Brigade and the Fenghuang Brigade of Buxianqiao Commune in Yueyang County launched a competition to see who could plant more, plant faster, and plant better, a fast and good situation immediately emerged. The Guanwang Brigade sent 800 elite soldiers into battle, planting 400 mu and reclaiming 47 mu of wasteland in one day; the rival Fenghuang Brigade immediately added labor, added enthusiasm, and added tools, increasing the winter planting labor force from 346 to 1,014 people, planting 717 mu in one day. After evaluation and inspection, the planting quality of both brigades met the requirements.

In the enthusiastic and large-scale winter planting movement, all regions have been firmly grasping winter planting quality from the very beginning. Since the beginning of autumn, Hunan Province has experienced prolonged drought with little rain, and relatively serious concentrated or interspersed droughts have appeared in many areas. Therefore, fighting drought and rushing to plant, and firmly grasping winter planting quality, has become the key to planting. Shaoyang Prefecture, the most severely affected by drought, mobilized 550,000 laborers to draw water to fight the drought. In addition to ensuring the irrigation of 1.1 million mu of late rice in the entire prefecture, they also rushed to plant more than 2 million mu of winter crops such as barley, wheat, rapeseed, winter vegetables, green manure, and feed. In the winter planting evaluation and competition movement in Chadong Commune and Tuanjie Commune in Huayuan County, they not only tried every means to expand the winter planting area, but also paid special attention to winter planting quality. They adopted measures such as vigorously promoting tool reforms, which improved work efficiency and ensured planting quality.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 18th: The autumn planting work in various parts of Gansu Province is progressing rapidly and with high quality. As of October 10, autumn crops sown throughout the province have accounted for 84.5% of the plan, of which wheat sowing accounted for 79.8% of the plan, and rapeseed is close to completion.

All parts of Gansu have expanded the autumn planting area, and various preparatory tasks have been done relatively solidly and carefully. This year, the area of wheat replanted after wheat has increased compared with previous years. Based on the characteristic of winter wheat having a "rich womb," in addition to taking necessary measures to promote early maturity, early harvest, and early stubble clearing of autumn crops, all regions have also adopted methods such as early plowing, early fertilizer transportation, early fertilization, early sowing, and more basal fertilizer, appropriately increasing the seeding rate, fully irrigating the base moisture, finely preparing the land, and finely sowing to ensure good winter wheat planting and strive for replanting to catch up with regular planting. Some counties and people's communes have also formulated specific yield-increasing measures and sowing technical operating procedures in advance based on summarizing past experiences. Due to sufficient preparation, the sowing work progressed smoothly and rapidly. Pingliang Prefecture, the main producing area of winter wheat in the province, has overfulfilled the wheat sowing task by 11.2%, and has also planted 267,000 mu of rapeseed.

In order to ensure planting more and planting well, all regions in the province have universally grasped planting quality during the sowing process. Ningxian County organized "ten people, six livestock, four drills, and one harrow" sowing teams, making the sowing process complete and coherent, and the quality was significantly improved. Shandan County transferred more than 1,000 cadres from various departments to go deep into the fields to participate in sowing, lead sowing, and conduct inspection and acceptance. All regions in the province have also carried out a major inspection of autumn planting quality. According to the inspection results of more than 5.3 million mu of land, in general, deep plowing, sufficient moisture, sufficient fertilizer, careful cultivation, and timely sowing have been achieved.

Now the autumn planting in the province has entered the final stage. While seizing the time to do a good job in the final stage, all regions are also paying close attention to field management of the emerged seedlings, carrying out seedling inspection and replanting to achieve full and strong seedlings, preserve moisture and prevent drought, and ensure safe wintering.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The winter wheat sowing work in the suburbs of Beijing has basically ended. At present, some communes and teams are seizing the opportunity after the rain to continue to expand the planting area, and most communes and teams have shifted to seedling management work.

This year, the wheat planting work in the suburbs of Beijing has been fast and of good quality. Most of the winter wheat was planted before the Cold Dew solar term, about one-third of which was "White Dew wheat." After inspection, in general, the requirements such as plowing, leveling, fertilization, selection of improved varieties, and reasonable close planting have been met. At present, the seedling emergence is generally good, laying a foundation for increased summer production next year.

The fundamental reason for the fast progress and good quality of winter wheat sowing this year is that the masses were earnestly mobilized to deeply study the policy of "engaging in agriculture and grain production on a large scale," and based on this policy, wheat planting plans and specific measures were discussed and formulated. After discussion, all regions implemented the preparatory work for land, fertilizer, seeds, water sources, tools, etc. to the teams according to local conditions, and quickly set off a wheat planting upsurge.

Concentrating forces on the wheat planting front and properly arranging labor are important reasons for the fast and good winter wheat sowing this year. Caiyu Commune in Daxing County mobilized more than 5,000 commune members and nine tractors, ten seeders, and more than 600 sets of plows to carry out shock wheat planting. On one day in early October, they planted more than 5,000 mu of wheat. Panggezhuang Commune improved labor organization, clearing land, plowing land, and sowing at the same time, and the daily progress of wheat planting increased sharply from 1,000 mu to 3,000 mu. Factories, mines, government agencies, enterprises, schools, and urban people's communes in Beijing have also successively sent more than 40,000 people to the agricultural front in a timely manner to help communes with autumn harvesting and wheat planting.

While the "five implementations" of land plots, fertilizers, water conservancy, seeds, and tools were being prepared, most production teams set up methods of three guarantees and one reward for wheat, setting off a vigorous and solid wheat planting competition, which powerfully promoted wheat planting work. At the beginning of wheat planting, Tian'en Brigade of Hongxing Commune took the lead and proposed an initiative to brother brigades in the suburbs to launch a wheat yield increase competition. Many communes and teams competed with Tian'en Brigade in enthusiasm and measures, competing from sowing to harvest. Within many communes and brigades, rival competitions were also launched to exchange experiences and learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses in a timely manner.

At present, most of the early sown wheat seedlings in the suburbs have emerged from the soil, and the communes have shifted their main forces to the management of wheat fields during the seedling stage. (Attached picture)

    据新华社长沙18日电　湖南省冬播工作已在全省各地迅速展开。截至14日止，全省已播种小麦、大麦、油菜、冬菜、绿肥、饲料等冬种作物二千八百万亩。进度最快的常德专区已超额完成了冬种计划。
    湖南省在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的方针鼓舞下，用大抓稻谷的劲头，大抓冬播作物，全省计划冬播作物的面积比去年有较多的扩大。为了又快又好地抓住季节，抢种冬季作物，常德、湘潭等专区采取了大搞群众运动的方法，组织队与队、组与组、人与人之间的评比竞赛。澧县在争分抢秒大种绿肥中，普遍开展了队与队、组与组、人与人之间三比（比扩种面积、进度、质量）和高工效、高质量的对手赛，大大加快了播种进度，保证了播种质量。澧阳公社在开展竞赛后，绿肥播种日进度由前一时期的二千多亩迅速增加到四千多亩。岳阳县步仙桥公社的关王大队和凤凰大队在开展比种得多、种得快、种得好的对手赛后，立即出现了又快又好的局面。关王大队八百名精兵上阵，一天播四百亩，开荒四十七亩；竞赛对手凤凰大队立即添劳力、添干劲、添工具，冬播劳力由三百四十六人增加到一千零十四人，一天播种七百十七亩。经过评比检查，两个大队的播种质量都符合要求。
    在热火朝天、声势浩大的冬播运动中，各地一开始就狠抓冬播质量。湖南省入秋以来久旱不雨，许多地区出现了较严重的集中或插花的干旱。因此抗旱抢种，狠抓冬播质量，便成了播种的关键。受旱最严重的邵阳专区出动五十五万劳动大军车水抗旱，除了保证全区一百一十万亩晚稻的灌溉外，还抢种了大麦、小麦、油菜、冬菜、绿肥、饲料等冬季作物二百多万亩。花垣县茶洞公社、团结公社在冬种评比竞赛运动中，一方面千方百计扩大冬种面积，同时又特别重视冬种质量，他们采取了大搞工具改革等措施，既提高了工效，又保证了播种质量。
    新华社兰州18日电　甘肃省各地的秋播工作进展快、质量高。截至10月10日，全省播种的秋种作物已占计划的84.5％，其中小麦播种占计划的79.8％，油菜已接近完成。
    甘肃各地都扩大了秋播面积，各项准备工作都做的比较扎实、细致。今年回茬麦面积比往年增加，各地根据冬小麦“胎里富”的特点，除采取必要措施，促使秋作物早熟、早收、早腾茬以外，还采用早耕地、早运肥、早施肥、早播种和多施底肥、适当加多播种量、灌足底墒水、精细整地、精细播种等办法，保证种好冬麦，力争回茬赶正茬。部分县和人民公社还在总结历年经验的基础上，事先制订了具体增产措施和播种技术操作规程。由于准备充分，播种工作进展顺利迅速，全省冬小麦的主要产地——平凉专区已超额11.2％完成了小麦播种任务，并且种油菜二十六万七千亩。
    为保证多种、种好，全省各地在播种过程中，普遍狠抓了播种质量。宁县组织“十人、六畜、四耧、一耘”的播种组，使播种工序配套成龙，质量显著提高。山丹县从各部门抽调一千多名干部，深入田间参加播种，领导播种，并进行检查验收。全省各地还开展了秋播质量大检查，据对五百三十多万亩地的检查结果，一般都作到了深耕、墒饱、肥足，耕作细致、播种适时。
    现在全省秋播已进入扫尾阶段。各地在抓紧做好扫尾工作的同时，对已出苗的正抓紧田间管理，进行查苗补苗，以达到苗全苗壮、保墒防旱、安全过冬。
    据新华社18日讯　北京郊区冬小麦播种工作已经基本结束。目前一部分社队正在抓住雨后时机继续扩大播种面积，大部分社队转入苗期管理工作。
    今年北京郊区种麦工作进度快，质量好。大部分冬小麦都抢在寒露节前种完，其中有三分之一左右是“白露麦”。经过检查，一般都达到了翻耕、平地、施肥、选用良种以及合理密植等要求。目前出苗情况普遍良好，为明年的夏季增产打下了根基。
    今年冬小麦播种进度快、质量好的根本原因，是认真发动群众，深入地学习了“大办农业大办粮食”的方针，根据这个方针讨论和制订了种麦计划和具体措施。经过讨论，各地因地制宜地把地块、肥料、种子、水源、工具等准备工作落实到队，迅速掀起了种麦高潮。
    集中力量到种麦前线，妥善安排劳动力，是今年冬小麦播种又快又好的一个重要原因。大兴县采育公社出动五千多名社员和九台拖拉机、十台播种机、六百多套犋，突击种麦，10月初的一天就种麦五千多亩。庞各庄公社改进劳动组织，边腾地、边耕地、边播种，种麦日进度由一千亩猛增到三千亩。北京市的厂矿、机关、企业、学校和城市人民公社也相继派出四万多人，及时赶到农业战线，帮助公社秋收和种麦。
    各公社在种麦地块、肥料、水利、种子、工具等准备工作“五落实”的同时，绝大部分生产队定下了小麦三包一奖的办法，掀起了轰轰烈烈而又扎扎实实的种麦竞赛，有力地推动了种麦工作。种麦一开始，红星公社天恩大队一马当先，向郊区各兄弟大队提出了开展小麦增产竞赛的倡议。不少社、队同天恩大队比干劲、比措施，从种到收，一赛到底。在许多公社和大队内部，还展开了对手赛，及时交流经验，取长补短。
    目前，郊区大部分早播的麦苗已经出土，各公社已经把主要力量转向了麦田苗期管理。（附图片）
