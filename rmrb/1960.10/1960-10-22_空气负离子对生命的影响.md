Air Negative Ions and Their Impact on Life
    Leng Jie
    After a thunderstorm, the cool air feels particularly fresh and breathing becomes a pleasure. Travelers experience the same pleasant sensation when staying near rapids or waterfalls. However, in muggy weather or while walking on busy streets, one feels a sense of labored breathing; we often say: the air is polluted.
    Why is there a difference between fresh and polluted air? Besides the amount of dust, scientists have discovered that a type of negatively charged ion is produced in the air during thunderstorms or when water mist is sprayed. This negative ion is also the reason why the air feels fresh, and at the same time, it has significant medicinal effects on humans and other living organisms. In different regions, the content of dust and negative ions are inversely proportional: the less dust in the air, the more negative ions it contains. This tells us why sanatoriums are often located in mountainous or coastal areas, and why most of the long-lived people in the world are working people living in high-altitude areas; air negative ions have such a great impact on life!
    We know that air is composed of countless molecules. Originally, these molecules are neutral, neither charged nor conductive. However, due to the influence of cosmic rays, solar ultraviolet radiation, and radioactive substances in soil and groundwater in nature, some gas molecules lose one or more of their outer-layer negatively charged electrons, becoming positive ions themselves. These free electrons quickly combine with another gas molecule, forming negative ions, also called light ions. In clean air, negative ions can only be neutralized by colliding with positive ions, and generally have a lifespan of more than twenty minutes. In polluted air, such as near factory chimneys – where there are five million dust particles per cubic centimeter of air – a large number of dust and other particles take away most of the negative ions. As a result, the lifespan of negative ions is shortened, and the content is reduced to a dozen, several, or even none. How can such polluted air be compared with the fresh air of the mountains?
    As early as 1903, the Russian scientist Sokolov first revealed the secret of air negative ions and their ability to cure diseases. Later, a Soviet professor conducted experiments with animals, powerfully proving this point. He filtered the air through a layer of cotton before supplying it to the animals for breathing. The negative ions in the natural air were intercepted. After a few days, the animals began to get sick, and some even died. When a large number of negative ions were introduced into the air, the animals' various functions were normal, they lived well, and even gained weight.
    For humans, when the air contains 100,000 to 1 million negative ions per cubic centimeter, it can be used to prevent and treat many diseases. Negative ions can lower blood pressure, which is especially beneficial for patients with hypertension. They can also treat asthma, gastric ulcers, and arteriosclerosis, with good results. At the same time, air negative ions can also remove microorganisms and dust. When used in hospital operating rooms, wards, germ rooms, or mines, public places, etc., it can freshen the air and prevent epidemic infectious diseases.
    Air negative ions have such great medicinal effects, so of course we cannot let it go lightly. Scientists have long begun to study methods to extract "medicine" from the air – air negative ions. In the Soviet Union, two types of air ionizers have been developed, one electric and one water-based. The electric one looks like a "chandelier" without a light bulb. A copper mesh is welded with hundreds of pointed wires. Turning on the power causes the tips of the wires to discharge, ionizing the surrounding air, producing 100 million negative ions per cubic centimeter, making the air fresh like a mountain morning. The water ionizer is just like an artificial fountain. A stream of high-pressure water is ejected from the pipe, hitting a circular disk, forming a fine water mist, and simultaneously generating a large number of negative ions. These two types of air ionizers are installed in hospitals, factories, and mines in the Soviet Union to regulate the air, prevent and treat diseases, and have achieved very good results.

    空气负离子对生命的影响
    冷洁
    一阵暴雷雨过后，清凉的空气格外新鲜，呼吸起来舒畅极了。旅行者停留在急流或瀑布旁边时，也有相同的愉快感觉。而在闷热的天气里，或走在热闹的街道上，却有一种呼吸比较费力的感觉，我们常说：空气混浊了。
    空气为什么有新鲜和混浊之分呢？除了和灰尘的多少有关系外，科学家发现原来在雷雨或水雾喷出的时候，空气中产生了一种带负电的离子。这种负离子也是使空气新鲜的原因，同时，它对人和其它生物还有重大的药物疗效。在不同的地区里，灰尘和负离子含量成反比例：空气中的灰尘越少，所含的负离子越多。这种情况告诉我们，为什么疗养院常要设在山区或海滨附近，为什么世界上的长寿者多半是生活在高山地区的劳动人民；空气负离子对生命有着多大的影响呵！
    我们知道，空气是由无数分子组成的。本来，这些分子是中性的，既不带电，也不导电。但由于受到自然界里的宇宙线、太阳紫外线和土壤、地下水源中放射性物质辐射的影响，有些气体分子就失去了一个或一个以上的外层带负电的电子，本身变成正离子了。那跑掉的自由电子很快又和另一个气体分子结合，形成了负离子，也叫轻离子。在清洁的空气里，负离子只有和正离子碰撞而中和的可能，一般寿命有二十多分钟。在混浊的空气里，比如在工厂烟囱附近——每立方厘米空气里有五百万颗灰尘；大量的灰尘等微粒拉走了大部分负离子，于是，负离子的寿命缩短了，含量减少到十几个、几个，甚至一个也没有。这样混浊的空气怎能和新鲜的山区空气相比呢？
    早在1903年，俄国科学家索柯洛夫首次揭开了空气负离子和用它能治病的秘密。以后，苏联有一位教授曾用动物做试验，有力地证明了这一点。他让空气先通过一层棉花来过滤，再供给动物呼吸。天然空气中的负离子被截住了，几天后，动物开始生病，有的竟死了。当向空气里通入很多负离子时，动物的各部机能正常，生活得很好，甚至体重也有所增加。
    对于人，每立方厘米空气中含有10万—100万个负离子时，就能用来预防和治疗许多疾病。负离子能降低血压，对高血压病患者特别有益。还能治疗气喘病、胃溃疡和动脉硬化等疾病，疗效都很好。同时，空气负离子还能清除微生物和灰尘。用于医院手术室、病房、病菌室或矿井、公共场所等处，就能使空气新鲜和预防流行性传染病。
    空气负离子的医疗作用这么大，当然不能轻轻放过它。科学家们早就开始研究从空气中取“药”——空气负离子的方法。在苏联，已制成两种空气电离器，一种用电，一种用水。用电的像一盏没有灯泡的“吊灯”，一张铜网上焊着几百根尖头导线，扭开电门，导线尖头放电使周围的空气电离，每立方厘米能产生一亿个负离子，使空气新鲜，像山区的早晨一样。水电离器恰像一座人工喷泉。一股高压水自管内喷出，射在一个圆盘上，形成细小的水雾，同时产生了大量的负离子。这两种空气电离器在苏联被安装在医院、工厂和矿井里，用来调节空气、预防和治疗疾病，收到了极良好的效果。
