Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 11th. More than 2,000 people from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a grand rally at the Grand Theater on the afternoon of the 10th to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea.

　　At 5 p.m., Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and Premier of the Cabinet, and other party and government leaders ascended the rostrum. Many labor heroes and combat heroes presented them with flowers. At this moment, the audience stood up and enthusiastically cheered "Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung!" "Long live the Workers' Party of Korea!" and other slogans, with applause and cheers lasting for a long time.

　　Also on the rostrum were Choe Yong-kun, Kim Il, Hong Myung-hui, Park Jung-ae, Park Kum-chul, Kim Chang-man, Jung Il-ryong, Nam Il, Kim Kwang-hyup, Rim Hae, Lee Jong-ok, Ha Ang-cheon, Kim Ik-sun, Jung Joon-taek and other party and government leaders, as well as responsible persons from various democratic parties, social organizations, and representatives of the working people.

　　Diplomatic envoys from various countries to North Korea were invited to attend the conference.

　　The conference began with the band playing the Internationale. Park Kum-chul, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, delivered a lengthy report at the conference. Kang Ryang-wook, Chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Democratic Party, and Park Shin-duk, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party, delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting. Members of the Pyongyang City Young Pioneers marched into the venue in formation singing the Song of General Kim Il-sung to offer warm congratulations.

　　In his report, Park Kum-chul first stated: Over the past fifteen years, our Party, as the vanguard of the Korean working masses led by the working class, has shouldered the fate of the motherland and the people, overcome numerous difficulties, and consistently guided our people towards victory, establishing indelible historical feats before the motherland and the nation. In the arduous struggle against enemies at home and abroad, the Party has been tempered and tested, and it has developed into a powerful Marxist-Leninist party with one million members closely united.

　　Our Party has won the absolute support and trust of the entire people and has a flesh-and-blood connection with the masses due to its infinite loyalty to the motherland and the people and its correct leadership. The entire people are more closely united around the Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung than ever before, entrusting their fate to the Party and advancing towards a bright future with the spirit of Chollima along the path pointed out by the Party.

　　The course our Party has traversed is a glorious history of struggle and creation against the attacks of ferocious enemies, defending the freedom and independence of the motherland, and establishing a happy new society, and a history of the brilliant victory of Marxism-Leninism.

　　Park Kum-chul then reviewed the path of struggle taken by the Workers' Party over the past fifteen years. He pointed out that the establishment of the Workers' Party of Korea was an epoch-making event in the Korean people's struggle for freedom and happiness and in the history of the Korean communist movement.

　　Park Kum-chul said: The establishment of our Party is the brilliant result of the long and arduous struggle of Korean communists to establish a Marxist-Leninist party, and it is a great victory for the Korean working class and the working masses in their struggle for national and social liberation.

　　He said that the reason why our Party has been able to rapidly strengthen and develop into such an invincible Marxist-Leninist party is by no means accidental. This is because our Party has concretely embodied the glorious revolutionary traditions formed by communists during the long anti-Japanese armed struggle and made its revolutionary spirit the guiding ideology of the entire Party. The development process of the Party in the fifteen years since liberation is a direct continuation and completion of the struggle waged by Korean communists since 1930 to establish a true Marxist-Leninist party.

　　Park Kum-chul said that in the past fifteen years, our Party, holding high the ever-victorious banner of Marxism-Leninism, has brought about great revolutionary changes in our society and brought about a fundamental transformation in the history of our people. Our Party is carrying out the revolution in an extremely difficult condition, in a backward colonial and semi-feudal society, with the land divided and one half occupied by the head of world reaction, U.S. imperialism. However, our Party's Marxist-Leninist leadership has guided the people to achieve brilliant victories in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution in the northern half of the Republic in a very short historical period, and has prepared decisive forces for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

　　The entire development process of our revolution clearly demonstrates our Party's infinite loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and its well-tested and skilled leadership in creatively applying and developing Marxism-Leninism.

　　Our Party has led the people to firmly establish on this land the socialist society that our ancestors dreamed of and for which our revolutionary martyrs fought for a long time – a society without exploitation, and continues to develop it. Today, our people are living in a period of national prosperity and prosperity that has never existed in Korean history.

　　Park Kum-chul said that in the entire process of leading our people's revolutionary cause, our Party has consistently waged a tenacious struggle to defend the principled nature of Marxism-Leninism. In any complex and difficult environment, our Party has resolutely implemented policies and lines formulated on the basis of scientific analysis of our country's specific conditions and in accordance with the principles of Marxism-Leninism without wavering.

　　He said that the vitality and invincible strength of our Party's leadership lies in the fact that the Party has resolutely relied on the mass line in leading the revolution with a Leninist action perspective. Our Party has always believed in the endless creative power and high political and labor enthusiasm of the working masses, and relied on it to put forward and implement all tasks. Precisely because it believes in the creative power and enthusiasm of the working masses, our Party was able to propose a policy of decisively promoting socialist construction, and was able to effectively complete complex and difficult tasks at every stage of revolutionary development.

　　Precisely because it relied on the strength of the masses and organized and mobilized the masses well, our Party was able to simultaneously solve difficult and arduous tasks such as restoring the damaged people's economy in a short period of time after the war, establishing the foundation of socialist industrialization, and rapidly improving the people's lives; it was able to simultaneously develop industry and agriculture, heavy industry, and the light industry, central industry, and local industry, and simultaneously put forward and implement the technological revolution and the cultural revolution.

　　The Chollima Movement, which has greatly accelerated the pace of our revolution, is a victory for the mass line consistently adhered to by our Party in leading socialist construction, and is the most obvious example of the Party's unbreakable unity with the masses. The Chollima work team movement is a living communist school, which has become a great driving force for the advancement of our society. Today's Chollima work team movement is a huge mass movement with more than 227,000 people, and it is rapidly expanding, becoming a great movement in all sectors of socialist construction such as factories, enterprises, rural areas, schools, hospitals, and cultural and art institutions. The mass movement of communist pioneers launched under the noble slogans of "working, studying, and living in the spirit of communism" and "one for all, all for one" is only possible under the victorious socialist system, which is the brilliant fruit of the Party's revolutionary tradition education. All these show that our people are effectively carrying out ideological and spiritual preparations while making material and technical preparations for entering communism.

　　Park Kum-chul said that the great achievements and the tremendous political and economic strength achieved by our Party and people in building socialism in the northern half of the Republic have opened up a decisive and favorable situation for the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

　　Our Party has put forward a reasonable plan that can open up a new situation in the practice of peaceful reunification of the motherland. A series of proposals put forward by our Party, such as the proposal to implement a federal system between North and South Korea and to organize a North-South Korean Economic Committee, have been absolutely supported by the entire Korean people and have received tremendous reactions from world public opinion.

　　The brilliant achievements in socialist construction in the northern half of the Republic have made the people in South Korea clearly understand the reasons for their great suffering and disasters, and have infinitely inspired and promoted their revolutionary fighting spirit. The people of South Korea, who regard the democratic base in the north as the hope of tomorrow, continue to strengthen their struggle for freedom and the right to survival and for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. No amount of suppression and deception by the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs can extinguish the flames of struggle that have already been set off in South Korea, nor can they stop the raging prairie fire. All this illustrates the great historical victory of the Marxist-Leninist political line consistently adhered to by our Party.

　　Park Kum-chul said that today, our people are facing new historical tasks of further consolidating the socialist system that has already been victorious in the northern half of the Republic, promoting socialist construction to a higher stage, and opening up a new situation for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

　　Park Kum-chul said that in order to effectively accomplish the revolutionary tasks before us, it is very important to further strengthen the headquarters of the Korean revolution – the Party – organizationally and ideologically, further enhance the Party's leadership role and its combat effectiveness, and unite the masses of all strata more firmly around the Party.

　　Park Kum-chul continued to say that our people are building socialism in a tense environment where half of the motherland's land is still occupied by U.S. imperialism and directly confronted by armed enemies. U.S. imperialism, the ringleader of world reaction, is entrenched in South Korea and colludes with all reactionary forces to carry out crazy conspiracies in an attempt to undermine our socialist construction and seize our socialist fruits. This actual situation does not allow us to have the slightest slackness.

　　Although socialism has triumphed in the northern half of the Republic, our socialist construction is carried out in a sharp class struggle. Therefore, we must further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, continue to strengthen the struggle against counter-revolutionary elements with a high degree of vigilance; and arm all working people with the idea of ​​always protecting our socialist system and fruits like a copper wall and iron wall, preventing enemy invasion, and defending the great cause of socialist construction. All party members and working people must establish a firm class view of distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy in any difficult environment and waging an uncompromising struggle against class enemies. In particular, we must use steadfast struggle to oppose all hostile bourgeois ideological intrusions.

　　Park Kum-chul said that revisionism, which reflects bourgeois ideology, is the main danger of the international worker and communist movement at the present time.

　　At the present time, international revisionists, headed by the Yugoslav Tito clique, are carrying out crazy conspiracies in an attempt to deny the common laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction, reject the leadership of the party under socialism, and undermine the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp. They beautify imperialism and carry out crazy activities in order to paralyze people's vigilance against imperialist conspiracies. We must always be highly vigilant against revisionist tendencies that serve the imperialists, spread illusions about imperialism, paralyze the revolutionary consciousness of the working people, and attempt to weaken the functions of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the leadership of the party.

　　U.S. imperialism is the ringleader of international reaction, the most ferocious enemy of mankind, and the mortal enemy of the Korean people. We must continue to thoroughly expose the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism, smash its aggressive conspiracies, and arm the people with the idea of ​​enhancing vigilance against the enemy and class hatred for the enemy.

　　Our experience proves that under the conditions of direct confrontation with the imperialists, we will be constantly invaded by reactionary bourgeois ideology; because the revolution is arduous and long-term, right-leaning opportunist elements who surrender to the pressure of bourgeois ideology will repeatedly appear in our ranks.

　　The conspiracy of the sectarian elements in 1956-1957 to reject the leadership of the party, weaken the dictatorship of the proletariat, and undermine the proletarian internationalist unity between our party and the fraternal parties during the period when the international workers movement was tested proves this.

　　In order to effectively promote our revolution, it is very important to continue to struggle against dogmatism while opposing revisionism.

　　Dogmatists do not understand how to creatively apply revolutionary theory to concrete reality, only follow existing formulas and conclusions, lack firm confidence and opinions in their own positions, and blindly follow others.

　　As our historical experience has proven, people who are tainted with dogmatism are lifeless and unable to promote our revolution.

　　Park Kum-chul said that we must further strengthen the unity and connection with the international communist and workers' movement, and continue to adhere to the position of subordinating everything to promoting the victory of our revolution.

　　In order to ensure the effective implementation of our revolution, it is particularly important to continuously improve the Party's work methods and style in adapting to the new situation created at the present time.

　　Park Kum-chul finally said: The road our Party has traveled in the past fifteen years is indeed full of proud achievements and brilliant victories. We have gone through the most difficult stages in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and are confidently advancing towards higher heights from which we can see a bright future, based on the solid achievements we have already made.

　　The firm friendship and unity with the people of socialist countries headed by the great Soviet Union is an important guarantee of all the victories of our people. Strengthening the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp is an important guarantee for defeating the imperialist policy of aggression, safeguarding lasting peace in the world, and winning the victory of socialism, and gives greater encouragement to the national liberation struggles of the people of colonial and dependent countries. Therefore, today, the imperialists and their running dog revisionists are using various conspiracies in an attempt to undermine this unity and solidarity, especially to sow discord among fraternal communist parties and workers' parties. However, their conspiracy is in vain. The Workers' Party of Korea will be faithful to proletarian internationalism in the future, further strengthen the unity with the Communist Party of China headed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and all other fraternal parties, and protect the unity and solidarity of the international communist and workers' movement like protecting the eyeballs.

    平壤隆重集会庆祝劳动党建党十五周年
    金日成等党和政府领导人出席　朴金喆作长篇报告
    朴金喆指出：党的发展过程是为建立真正的马克思列宁主义的党而斗争的过程；千里马运动是党领导社会主义建设方面一贯坚持的群众路线的胜利；社会主义建设是在尖锐的阶级斗争中进行的，党员要树立分清敌我的牢固的阶级观点；反映了资产阶级思想的修正主义是目前国际共产主义运动的主要危险；美帝国主义是国际反动的元凶，是朝鲜人民不共戴天的敌人；进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，加强一切兄弟党的团结。
    新华社平壤11日电　平壤市各界二千多人10日下午在大剧场举行盛大集会，庆祝朝鲜劳动党建党十五周年。
    下午五时，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会委员长、内阁首相金日成等党和政府的领导人登上主席台，许多劳动英雄和战斗英雄向他们献了花。这时，全场起立热烈欢呼“金日成元帅万岁！”“朝鲜劳动党万岁！”等口号，掌声和欢呼声经久不息。
    登上主席台的还有崔庸健、金一、洪命熹、朴正爱、朴金喆、金昌满、郑一龙、南日、金光侠、林海、李钟玉、河仰天、金翊善、郑准泽等党和政府的领导人，以及各民主政党社会团体的负责人和劳动人民代表。
    各国驻朝鲜的外交使节应邀参加了大会。
    大会在乐队高奏国际歌后开始，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴金喆在大会上作了长篇报告。北朝鲜民主党中央委员会委员长康良煜和天道教青友党中央委员会委员长朴信德在会上致了祝词。平壤市的少年团团员们唱着金日成将军之歌列队到会场上来热烈祝贺。
    朴金喆在报告中首先说：十五年来，我们的党作为以工人阶级为首的朝鲜劳动群众的先锋队，肩负起祖国和人民的命运，克服了重重困难，一直引导我们人民走向胜利，在祖国和民族面前立下了不可磨灭的历史性的丰功伟绩。在同国内外敌人进行的艰苦斗争中，党受到了锻炼和考验，它已经发展成为一个有一百万党员紧密团结在一起的强大的马克思列宁主义政党。
    我们的党由于对祖国和人民无限忠诚和领导的正确，获得了全体人民的绝对支持和信赖，同群众有着血肉般的联系。全体人民比任何时候都更紧密地团结在以金日成同志为首的党的周围，他们把自己的命运托付给党，沿着党指出的道路，正在以千里马的气势向着光明的未来前进。
    我们党所走过的历程是一部反对凶恶敌人的进攻、保卫祖国的自由独立和建立人民幸福的新社会的光荣斗争和创造的历史，是一部马克思列宁主义取得光辉胜利的历史。
    朴金喆接着回顾了劳动党十五年来所走过的斗争道路。他指出，朝鲜劳动党的建立，这在朝鲜人民争取自由幸福的斗争中和朝鲜共产主义运动历史上是一个划时代的事件。
    朴金喆说：我们党的建立是朝鲜共产主义者为建立马克思列宁主义的党而进行长期艰苦斗争的光辉硕果，是我国工人阶级和劳动大众在争取民族和社会解放的斗争中取得的伟大胜利。
    他说，我们党所以能够迅速地加强和发展成为这样不可战胜的马克思列宁主义的党决不是偶然的。这是因为，我们党把共产主义者在长期的抗日武装斗争过程中所形成的光辉的革命传统具体地体现出来，并将其革命精神成为全党的主导思想的结果。解放后十五年来党的发展过程是朝鲜共产主义者们从1930年开始的为建立真正的马克思列宁主义的党而进行的斗争的直接继续和完成。
    朴金喆说，在过去十五年间，我们党高举百战百胜的马克思列宁主义的旗帜，给我国社会带来了伟大革命变革，使我国人民的历史发生了根本的转变。我们党是在落后的殖民地半封建的社会、在国土分裂并且它的一半被世界反动的头子美帝国主义强占的极其困难的条件下进行革命的。可是，我们党的马克思列宁主义的领导，引导人民在很短的历史时期内，在共和国北半部取得了民主革命和社会主义革命的光辉胜利，并为祖国的和平统一准备了决定性的力量。
    我国革命的整个发展过程清楚地证明了我们党对马克思列宁主义的无限忠诚和创造性地运用和发展马克思列宁主义的久经考验的纯熟的领导。
    我们党领导人民在这块土地上巩固地建立了我们的祖先所梦想过的、我们的革命先烈为之进行了流血的长期斗争的没有剥削的社会——社会主义社会，并且继续发展它。今天，我们人民生活在朝鲜历史上从来没有过的那种民族繁荣和昌盛的时期。
    朴金喆说，我们党在领导我们人民的革命事业的整个过程中，一贯为保卫马克思列宁主义的原则性而进行了顽强的斗争。我们党在任何复杂和困难的环境中也毫不动摇的坚决贯彻了根据对我国具体情况的科学的分析和遵循马克思列宁主义的原则所制订的政策和路线。
    他说，我们党的领导的生命力和不可战胜的力量在于：党在领导革命中坚决依靠列宁主义的行动观点贯彻了群众路线。我们党从来相信劳动群众的无穷无尽的创造力量和高度的政治、劳动热情，并且依靠它提出和执行了一切任务。正因为相信劳动群众的创造力量和热情，我们党才能够提出了关于决定性的促进社会主义建设的方针，才能够在革命发展的每个时期有效地完成了复杂而困难的任务。
    正因为依靠群众的力量，很好地组织和动员了群众，我们党才能够同时解决了战后在短时间内恢复被破坏的人民经济，建立社会主义工业化的基础，迅速提高人民生活等困难而艰巨的任务；才能够同时发展工业和农业，重工业和轻工业，中央工业和地方工业，同时提出和实行技术革命和文化革命。
    大大促进我国革命前进速度的千里马运动是我们党领导社会主义建设方面一贯坚持的群众路线的胜利，是党同群众的牢不可破的统一团结的最明显的实例。千里马作业班运动，是活生生的共产主义学校，它成为使我们社会前进的伟大的推动力。今天的千里马作业班运动，是拥有二十二万七千多名群众的巨大的群众运动，并正在迅速扩大着，它成了工厂、企业以及农村、学校、医院、文化艺术机关等社会主义建设一切部门的伟大运动。在“以共产主义的精神来工作、学习、生活”、“一人为大家，大家为一人”的高尚口号下掀起的共产主义先驱者的群众运动，只有在胜利的社会主义制度下才有可能，这是党的革命传统教育的光辉果实。所有这些都说明了我国人民为了进入共产主义在进行物质、技术准备的同时，也有效地进行了思想和精神的准备。
    朴金喆说，在共和国北半部建设社会主义的斗争中，我们党和人民所取得的伟大成就和具有的巨大的政治、经济的力量，为祖国的和平统一伟业开辟了决定性的有利的局面。
    我们党在和平统一祖国的实践中，提出了能够打开新局面的合理的方案。我们党提出的关于实施南北朝鲜的联邦制和组织南北朝鲜经济委员会的建议等一系列的方案，受到全体朝鲜人民的绝对的支持，得到了世界舆论的巨大的反应。
    共和国北半部的社会主义建设中所取得的辉煌成就，使南朝鲜人民清楚地了解到他们遭受极大的痛苦和灾祸究竟是什么原因，无限的鼓舞和推动了他们的革命的斗志。把北半部民主基地当作明天的希望的南朝鲜人民，要求自由和生存的权利，为祖国的和平统一继续加强着斗争。美帝国主义者和它的走狗，用任何镇压和欺骗也不能扑灭在南朝鲜已经掀起来的斗争的火焰，也挡不住熊熊的燎原之火。这一切说明了我们党一贯坚持的马克思列宁主义的政治路线的伟大的历史性的胜利。
    朴金喆说，今天，我们人民面临着进一步巩固已经在共和国北半部取得了胜利的社会主义制度，促进社会主义建设到一个更高的阶段，开辟祖国的和平统一的新局面的新的历史任务。
    朴金喆说，为了有成效地完成摆在我们面前的革命任务，我们要进一步从组织上思想上加强朝鲜革命的参谋部——党，进一步提高党的领导作用和它的战斗能力，把各阶层的群众更牢固地团结在党的周围，这是很重要的。
    朴金喆接着说，我们人民是在祖国的土地还有一半在美帝国主义的侵占下，同武装的敌人直接对峙的紧张的环境中建设社会主义的。世界反动的元凶——美帝国主义者盘踞在南朝鲜同一切反动势力相勾结，进行疯狂的阴谋活动，企图破坏我们的社会主义建设，夺取我们的社会主义的果实。这种实际情况不允许我们有丝毫的松懈。
    虽然，社会主义在共和国北半部胜利了，但我们的社会主义建设是在尖锐的阶级斗争中进行的。因此，我们要进一步加强无产阶级专政，以高度的警惕性继续加强同反革命分子的斗争；以经常铜墙铁壁般的保卫我们的社会主义制度和果实，防止敌人的侵犯，保卫社会主义建设的伟大事业的思想把全体劳动人民武装起来。所有的党员和劳动人民要树立在任何困难的环境下也要分清敌我、为反对阶级敌人进行不妥协的斗争的牢固的阶级观点。特别是必须以坚定性的斗争反对一切敌对资产阶级的思想的侵袭。
    朴金喆说，反映了资产阶级思想的修正主义是目前时期国际工人运动和共产主义运动的主要危险。
    目前时期，以南斯拉夫铁托集团为首的国际修正主义者进行着疯狂的阴谋活动，企图否认社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同规律，拒绝社会主义下的党的领导，破坏社会主义阵营的统一团结。他们美化帝国主义，为了麻痹人民对帝国主义阴谋活动的警惕性而进行疯狂的活动。我们必须对为帝国主义者服务、散布对帝国主义的幻想、麻痹劳动人民革命觉悟、企图削弱无产阶级专政和党的领导的机能的修正主义倾向经常提高警惕。
    美帝国主义是国际反动的元凶，是人类最凶恶的敌人，是朝鲜人民的不共戴天的敌人。我们必须继续彻底地揭露美帝国主义的侵略本性，粉碎其侵略阴谋，并以提高对敌人的警惕和对敌人的阶级仇恨的思想武装人民。
    我们的经验证明，在同帝国主义者直接对峙的条件下，将受到反动的资产阶级思想的不断的侵袭；因为革命带有艰苦性和长期性，在我们的队伍中也会一再出现向资产阶级思想的压力投降的右倾机会主义的因素。
    1956—1957年在国际工人运动经受考验的时期，企图拒绝党的领导、削弱无产阶级专政、破坏我们党和兄弟党之间的无产阶级国际主义团结的宗派分子的阴谋活动就说明了这一点。
    为了有成效地推行我们的革命，在反对修正主义的同时，继续为反对教条主义进行斗争是很重要的。
    教条主义者不懂得把革命的理论创造性地运用于具体的现实中，只会追随既有的公式和结论，对自己的立场缺乏牢固的信心和主见，麻木地跟着别人跑。
    如同我们的历史经验所证明的一样，沾染了教条主义的人们毫无生气，对推行我们的革命无能为力。
    朴金喆说，我们要进一步加强同国际共产主义和工人运动的团结和联系，继续坚持一切服从于促进我国革命的胜利的立场。
    为了保证我们革命的有成效地实行，适应目前时期造成的新的形势，不断改善党的工作方法和作风的问题是特别重要的。
    朴金喆最后说：我们党在过去十五年间走过的道路的确是充满了值得自豪的成就和光辉的胜利。我们在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中已经走过了最困难的阶段，以已经取得的巩固的成就为基础，向着能够望见辉煌的未来的更高的高地充满了信心地前进。
    同以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义各国人民的牢固的友谊团结是我们人民的一切胜利的重要保证。社会主义阵营的统一团结的加强，是使帝国主义的侵略政策破产、保卫世界持久和平、争取社会主义胜利的重要保证，并给予殖民地附属国人民的民族解放斗争以更大的鼓舞。因此，今天帝国主义者和它的走狗修正主义者用各种阴谋企图破坏这一统一团结，特别是在兄弟的共产党和工人党之间进行离间。但是，它们的这种阴谋是徒劳的。朝鲜劳动党今后将忠实于无产阶级国际主义，进一步加强同以苏联共产党为首的中国共产党和其他一切兄弟党的团结，像保护眼珠一样保卫国际共产主义和工人运动的统一团结。
