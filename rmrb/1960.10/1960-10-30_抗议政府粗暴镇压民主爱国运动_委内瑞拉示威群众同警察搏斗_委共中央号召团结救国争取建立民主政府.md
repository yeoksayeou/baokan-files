Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, 27th - Yesterday, clashes between demonstrators and police continued to occur in the Venezuelan capital, marking the eighth day of conflict since October 19th.

    The conflicts were particularly intense in "January 23rd," "El Prado de María," "Lomas de Urdaneta," and other urban areas. In the afternoon, as a procession carried the coffin of worker Acosta Rivas, who was killed by the police, from the university city, soldiers and police opened fire on the march, killing Alexis Muñoz, an engineering student.

    The day before, demonstrators in the capital also clashed with police and armed forces patrols. Gunfire could be heard in various urban areas throughout the night of the 25th. Citizens in some areas built barricades to resist armed police attempting to occupy these areas. Many people were injured and arrested in the clashes.

    The mass demonstrations are demanding the release of left-wing revolutionary movement leaders arrested on the 19th and protesting the brutal suppression of the democratic and patriotic movement.

    Xinhua News Agency report from Caracas: The development of the political situation in Venezuela has attracted close attention from Latin American public opinion. Recently, the differences and contradictions between the two major parties in the Venezuelan coalition government—Democratic Action and the Democratic Republican Union—on domestic and foreign policies have become increasingly acute. The Democratic Republican Union resigned its party's two ministerial positions in the government on the 23rd, triggering a cabinet crisis.

    The Democratic Republican Union is a party based on the petty bourgeoisie, advocating opposition to imperialism, implementation of land reform, and execution of an independent foreign policy, demanding the organization of a national unity government that changes the current government's policies and represents the feelings of the majority of the people.

    On the issue of Cuba, the Democratic Republican Union demands the implementation of a policy of resolutely supporting the Cuban revolution.

    In a resolution on the domestic situation adopted at the 25th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Venezuela, which closed on October 14, it called for unity to save the nation, "to ensure the independent economic development of the country, calling for striving to establish a democratic and patriotic government representing the vast majority of Venezuelans."

    据新华社加拉加斯27日电　昨天，委内瑞拉首都继续发生示威群众同警察发生武装冲突事件，这是10月19日以来发生冲突的第八天。
    在“1月23日”、“埃耳普拉多德玛丽亚”、“洛马斯德乌尔达内塔”以及其他市区，冲突更为激烈。下午，当游行队伍抬着被警察杀害的工人阿科斯塔·里瓦斯的棺材从大学城出发时，士兵和警察向游行队伍开枪，一个叫阿莱西斯·穆尼奥斯的工学院学生又被枪弹打死了。
    在前一天，首都的游行示威者也同警察及武装部队的巡逻队发生了冲突。25日的整个夜间，在各市区可以听到枪声。有些市区的市民筑起路障，抵抗企图占领这些市区的武装警察。在冲突中有许多人受伤和被捕。
    群众示威是为了要求释放在19日被捕的左派革命运动领导人，并抗议对民主爱国运动的粗暴镇压。
    据新华社讯　加拉加斯消息：委内瑞拉政局的发展，引起了拉丁美洲舆论的密切注意。最近以来，委内瑞拉联合政府中的两个大党——民主行动党和共和民主联盟在国内外政策上的分歧和矛盾日益尖锐。共和民主联盟23日提出辞去这个党在政府中的两个部长职务，因而引起了一次内阁危机。
    共和民主联盟是以小资产阶级为基础的政党，它主张反对帝国主义，实行土地改革，执行独立的外交政策，要求组织一个改变现政府政策和代表大多数人民感情的全国团结的政府。
    在对待古巴的问题上，共和民主联盟要求执行坚决支持古巴革命的政策。
    委内瑞拉共产党中央委员会在10月14日闭幕的第二十五次全体会议上通过的关于国内局势的决议中，号召团结救国，“以保证国家独立的经济发展，号召争取建立一个代表委内瑞拉绝大多数的民主爱国政府。”
