Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 23rd: Marshal He Long, head of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea, delivered the following speech at Pyongyang Railway Station today:

    Respected Comrade General Kim Kwang-hyup, dear comrades and friends:

    Our People's Republic of China Military Friendship Delegation to Korea and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Art Troupe have come to our close neighbor, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, for a friendly visit, and will participate with our dear Korean comrades in the commemorative activities for the 10th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering Korea to fight. Comrade General Luo Ruiqing, all the comrades of the delegation and the art troupe, and I feel very honored and happy. First of all, please allow me to convey the highest respect and most cordial greetings of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, and to convey the deep memories and familial greetings of all former volunteer officers and soldiers who participated in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea to their Korean comrades. At the same time, I and all the comrades of our delegation and art troupe would like to express our deep gratitude to you for such a warm and grand welcome today.

    Under the wise leadership of the Workers’ Party of Korea and the respected leader of the Korean people, Premier Kim Il-sung, the heroic Korean people have experienced an arduous and glorious journey of struggle. In the past fifteen years, the diligent and brave Korean people have carried out earth-shaking revolutionary changes, waged an admirable and commendable just war to defend the motherland, and carried out high-speed socialist construction. With vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm, the Korean people have launched a nationwide Chollima movement, and have achieved great successes on all fronts of socialist construction, completing the total industrial output value of the first five-year plan two and a half years ahead of schedule. With the development of the cause of socialist construction, the Korean People's Army has rapidly strengthened its combat power, and it has now become a strong force defending the motherland and the eastern outpost of the socialist camp. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have always felt sincere joy and pride in the brilliant achievements made by the fraternal Korean people and the Korean People's Army.

    China and Korea are fraternal neighbors as closely related as lips and teeth. In the common struggle against US imperialist aggression, our two peoples fought side by side and jointly defeated the American aggressors. This combat friendship and unity cemented with blood, this friendship and unity based on Marxism-Leninism and great proletarian internationalism, has been tested by serious struggle and is evergreen and unbreakable.

    The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the fraternal Korean people for peaceful unification of their motherland, and deeply sympathize with and support the struggle of the South Korean people against the American aggressors and their agents. We firmly believe that with the support of the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world, the Korean people's just struggle will surely achieve complete victory. The US imperialists' conspiracy to stubbornly remain in South Korea for a long time, obstructing and undermining the peaceful unification of Korea, will surely be thoroughly defeated in the face of the thirty million Korean people who have a tradition of revolutionary struggle.

    Dear comrades! The friendly visit of the military delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea headed by Comrade General Kim Kwang-hyup to our country last September and October made a valuable contribution to enhancing the fraternal friendship between the people and armies of China and Korea. We believe that this visit of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation will not only enable us to learn a lot of valuable experience, but will also further develop the lofty friendship between us. In the great struggle against our common enemy, US imperialism, and in defense of world peace, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army will always be the faithful friends of the Korean people!

    Long live the unbreakable combat friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Korea!

    Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    Long live world peace!

    贺龙元帅的讲话
    新华社平壤23日电　中国访朝军事友好代表团团长贺龙元帅今天在平壤车站的讲话，全文如下：敬爱的金光侠大将同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我们中华人民共和国访朝军事友好代表团和中国人民解放军文艺工作团，这次来到我们亲密的邻邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行友好访问，并将同亲爱的朝鲜战友们一起，参加为中国人民志愿军入朝作战十周年而进行的纪念活动，我和罗瑞卿大将及代表团、文工团的全体同志都感到十分荣幸和愉快。首先，请允许我转达中国人民和中国人民解放军对朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军的最崇高的敬意和最亲切的问候，转达所有参加过抗美援朝的前志愿军官兵对朝鲜战友们的深切怀念和亲人般的问候。同时，对于你们今天这样热情、隆重的欢迎，我和我们代表团及文工团的全体同志，也要向你们表示深深的感谢。
    英雄的朝鲜人民，在朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成首相的英明领导下，经历了艰苦而光荣的战斗路程。十五年来，勤劳勇敢的朝鲜人民进行了天翻地复的革命变革，进行了可歌可颂的保卫祖国的正义战争，进行了高速度的社会主义建设。朝鲜人民以旺盛的革命热情，掀起了全民的跨上千里马运动，在社会主义建设的各个战线上都获得了伟大的成就，使第一个五年计划的工业总产值提前两年半完成。随着社会主义建设事业的发展，朝鲜人民军迅速地加强了战斗威力，现在它已经成为保卫祖国、保卫社会主义阵营东方前哨的一支坚强力量。中国人民和中国人民解放军，一向为兄弟的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军所取得的光辉成就感到由衷的喜悦和骄傲。
    中朝两国是唇齿相依的兄弟邻邦，在反抗美帝国主义侵略的共同斗争中，我们两国人民并肩作战，共同打败了美国侵略者。这种用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊和团结，这种建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的、伟大的无产阶级国际主义的友谊和团结，是经过了严重斗争考验的，是万古长青、牢不可破的。
    中国人民坚决支持兄弟的朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一的正义斗争，深切同情和支持南朝鲜人民反对美国侵略者及其代理人的斗争。我们深信，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国和全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，朝鲜人民的正义斗争一定会获得完全的胜利。美帝国主义妄想长期赖在南朝鲜不走，阻挠和破坏朝鲜和平统一的阴谋，在三千万富有革命斗争传统的朝鲜人民面前，一定会遭到彻底的失败。
    亲爱的同志们！去年9、10月间，以金光侠大将为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国军事代表团在我国的友好访问，对增进中朝两国人民及其军队之间的兄弟友谊，作出了宝贵的贡献。我们相信，中国军事友好代表团的这次访问，不仅将使我们学习到很多的宝贵经验，并且将使我们之间的崇高友谊获得进一步的发展。在反对我们的共同敌人美帝国主义和保卫世界和平的伟大斗争中，中国人民和中国人民解放军，将永远是朝鲜人民的忠实朋友！
    中朝两国人民和两国军队之间的牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
