    The People's Armed Forces destroyed the bridge at Huai Ta Gue, liberating most of the people concentrated by the Phoumi Nosavan clique. At the same time, they intercepted a military vehicle of the rebel army and seized many weapons and ammunition that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique had supplied to the Phoumi Nosavan clique.

    The People's Armed Forces captured the soldiers escorting the military vehicle. According to a captured soldier named Tao Tha, he was responsible for transporting weapons supplied by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to the Phoumi Nosavan clique. He said that in September, dozens of vehicles a day transported weapons from the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to the Phoumi Nosavan clique.

    The captured soldier also said that Takong, which is directly under the Chepone sub-district, is the location where the Phoumi Nosavan clique receives weapons from the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and where the officers of the two cliques make contact.
