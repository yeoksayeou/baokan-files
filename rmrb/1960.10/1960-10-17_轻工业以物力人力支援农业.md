Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Since the beginning of this year, light industrial factories across the country, including those producing food, sugar, tobacco, paper, and salt, have made significant achievements in supporting agriculture. Factories in various regions have not only produced a large number of light industrial products suitable for rural needs but also used by-products and waste materials to manufacture a large quantity of pesticides, fertilizers, and feed for rural areas. Factories have also dispatched personnel to the countryside during the off-season to support agricultural production and technological transformation in terms of labor and technology.

The production of various light industrial products with relatively large demand in rural areas, such as sewing machines, shoe-sole sewing machines, thermos bottles, enamel basins, flashlights, rubber shoes, and fountain pens, has increased significantly in the first nine months of this year compared to the same period last year. Other products, such as ceramic pipes for water conservancy projects, carriage axles and rubber wheels for short-distance transportation, as well as a wide variety of small farm tools and small hardware products, have also increased significantly. A large number of small, new-style farm tools have been manufactured for rural areas this year, and the efficiency of these new farm tools is generally one to ten times higher than that of the old-style tools. Light industrial factories in various regions have also paid attention to studying the characteristics of agricultural production, improving the structure, specifications, and styles of some existing products, and trial-producing some new products. For example, the Shanghai light industry department produced a large number of wind and rain-proof gas lamps to meet the needs of rush harvesting and planting; the Hebei Province light industry department successfully trial-produced dry ice for artificial rainfall, which strongly supported the fight against drought; bicycle factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other cities have produced a type of heavy-duty bicycle suitable for short-distance transportation in rural areas, which can carry 200 kilograms at a time; paper mills have produced a type of seedling paper for rural areas, which can be placed on newborn plants to protect seedlings from wind and snow and absorb sunlight.

Using by-products, molasses, distillers' grains, and waste liquids to produce pig feed, fertilizer, and pesticides for rural areas has become a regular production item for light industrial factories across the country. Factories in all walks of life have built workshops for producing feed, chemical fertilizers, or pesticides based on the production characteristics of their factories. The Henan Xinzhong Cigarette Factory uses cigarette ash to manufacture insecticides. The Hunan Yueyang and Hebei Baoding Oil and Chemical Factories use furfural residue or glycerol residue to make fertilizer, and furfural waste liquid to treat skin diseases in livestock. Many food factories use waste liquid and residue to manufacture humic acid, alkali lignin, and various antibiotics as pesticides and fertilizers. Egg product factories also use eggshells to make calcium feed and agricultural fertilizer. Some sugar factories in Northeast China and Guangdong have established calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer factories. Many food factories have already used by-products to produce large quantities of pesticides, fertilizers, and pig feed. In addition to ordinary pig feed, pesticides, and fertilizers, factories in various regions have boldly created various high-efficiency feeds and pesticides in conjunction with scientific research. For example, the high-grade feed produced by distilleries in Hubei, Henan, and other places using distillers' grains is highly nutritious, can quickly promote the development of pigs and poultry, and reduce the incidence of disease. The pesticide manufactured by the Henan Xuchang Cigarette Factory by extracting nicotine from waste liquid has an insecticidal rate of over 95%.

In the mass movement to support agriculture, light industrial factories in various regions closely integrated with agricultural seasons, using the off-season of production in their factories to dispatch a portion of their personnel to the countryside to support agricultural production and technological transformation. For example, the sugar factory's pressing season is generally in winter and spring, and it is relatively free in summer and autumn. Therefore, major sugar factories dispatch workers to the countryside during the busy summer and autumn agricultural seasons, on the one hand to help people's communes strengthen field management and increase the unit area yield of sugarcane and sugar beets, and on the other hand to train technical personnel for the communes. In the past few months, the six major sugar factories in Heilongjiang Province dispatched workers to participate in field management in sugar beet planting areas, totaling 70,000 workdays; another 800 technicians went deep into the fields to impart new technologies and new experiences; recently, another 9,000 people were dispatched to the countryside to help harvest and transport sugar beets. The eleven major sugar factories in Guangdong Province trained more than 600 agricultural technicians and skilled workers for the people's communes in sugarcane planting areas. The light industry department in Sichuan Province trained more than 16,000 various technicians for economic crop areas. Many cigarette factories, sugar factories, and wineries in Sichuan, Henan, Heilongjiang, and other places, in addition to sending experienced technicians to the communes and production teams to help solve technical problems, also issued technical materials to impart experience in field management and pest and disease control of economic crops.

In addition, light industrial factories in various regions also used their manufacturing and repair capabilities to repair and manufacture a large number of agricultural tools for people's communes. Light industrial factories in Guangdong, Henan, and Heilongjiang provinces dispatched repair workers and equipment to set up farm tool repair shops, or went to the fields to repair farm tools. Some sugar factories in Guangdong and Heilongjiang manufactured sugarcane and sugar beet harvesters, peeling machines, and inter-row hoeing machines for farmers. Dairy factories in Inner Mongolia trial-produced milking machines for herdsmen.

    轻工业以物力人力支援农业
    食品、制糖、烟草、造纸、制盐等工厂生产了大量适应农业生产和农村生活的产品
    利用下脚废料生产出大量肥料、农药结合农时抽调人员下乡推动了农业技术改造
    据新华社16日讯　全国各地食品、制糖、烟草、造纸、制盐等轻工业工厂，今年以来在支援农业方面作出了很大成绩。各地工厂不仅生产了大量适合农村需要的轻工业品，并且利用下脚废料和废弃物资，为农村制造了大批农药、肥料、饲料。各厂还在生产淡季抽调一部分人员下乡，在劳动力和技术上支援农业。
    农村需要量比较大的各种轻工业品，如缝纫机、纳鞋底机、保温瓶、搪瓷面盆、手电筒、胶鞋、自来水笔等，今年前九个月的产量都比去年同期增长了许多。其他如修建水利工程用的陶瓷管道，短途运输用的马车轴承、橡胶车轮，以及种类繁多的小农具、小五金商品，也都有很大增长。今年为农村制造了大量小型新式农具，这些新式农具的效率一般比旧式农具提高一倍到十倍。各地轻工业工厂由于注意研究农业生产的特点，还改进了一些原有产品的结构、规格和式样，试制出一些新产品。如上海轻工业部门为了适应抢收抢种的需要，生产出大批能防风雨的汽灯；河北省轻工业部门试制成功人工降雨用的干冰，有力地支援了抗旱斗争；上海、天津、青岛等自行车厂都生产了一种适应农村短途运输用的载重自行车，一次可以载重二百公斤；造纸工厂为农村生产出一种育苗纸，把它盖在新生的植物上，能使幼苗不怕风雪侵袭，又能吸收阳光。
    利用下脚料、糖渣、酒糟、废液等为农村生产猪饲料、肥料、农药，已成为全国各地轻工业工厂的经常性的生产项目。各行各业的工厂大都已根据本工厂的生产特点，建起了生产饲料、化肥或农药的车间。河南新中卷烟厂利用烟灰制造杀虫剂。湖南岳阳和河北保定油脂化学工厂，利用糠醛废渣或甘油残渣制肥料，利用糠醛废液医治家畜的癞皮病。不少食品工厂利用废液废渣制造胡敏酸、碱木素和各种抗菌素等农药和肥料。蛋品工厂也利用蛋壳制出钙质饲料和农肥。东北和广东的一部分糖厂办了钙镁磷肥厂。许多食品工厂已经利用下脚料生产了大量农药、肥料和猪饲料。除了普通的猪饲料和农药、肥料以外，各地工厂还结合科学研究工作，大胆创造出各种各样的高效率饲料和农药。如湖北、河南等地酒厂利用酒糟生产的高级饲料，营养价值很高，能较快地促进猪和家禽的发育，降低发病率。河南许昌烟厂从废液中提炼尼古丁制造的农药，杀虫率达95％以上。
    在支援农业的群众运动中，各地轻工业工厂密切结合农时，利用本工厂的生产淡季，抽调一部分人员下乡，支援农业生产和技术改造。如糖厂的榨季一般在冬、春两季，夏天和秋天比较空闲，于是各大糖厂都在夏秋农忙季节抽调职工下乡，一面帮助人民公社加强田间管理，提高甘蔗和甜菜的单位面积产量，一面为公社培养技术力量。黑龙江省六大糖厂前几个月抽调职工参加甜菜种植区的田间管理，共做了七万个劳动日；还有八百个技术工人深入田间传授新技术新经验；最近又出动九千人到农村帮助收割和运输甜菜。广东省十一个大糖厂为甘蔗种植区的人民公社训练了六百多名农技师和技工。四川省轻工业部门为经济作物区培养各种技工一万六千多人。四川、河南、黑龙江等地的许多烟厂、糖厂、酒厂，除派遣有经验的技术工人到公社和生产队帮助解决技术问题以外，还印发技术资料，传授经济作物田间管理和防治病虫害的经验。
    此外，各地轻工业工厂还利用本企业的制造、修理力量，为人民公社修配和制造大量农具。广东、河南、黑龙江省的轻工业工厂抽调修配工人和设备设立修配农具门市部，或到田间修理农具。广东和黑龙江部分糖厂，为农民制造了甘蔗和甜菜的收割机、除皮机、中耕除草机。内蒙古的乳品厂为牧民试制出挤奶器。
