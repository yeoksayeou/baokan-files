The fourth quarter is an extremely important quarter for industrial production, transportation, and capital construction. In this quarter, we must make the greatest efforts to overfulfill and complete the annual national plan ahead of schedule, and at the same time, make many specific preparations for production in the first quarter of next year. Working for today and for tomorrow simultaneously, the task is very arduous. To successfully complete these tasks, all employees need to make persistent efforts and be full of energy; enterprise leaders also need to pay attention to working methods and be good at correctly arranging the production and work for these three months.

How to correctly arrange production for the last three months of this year? Should the quarterly tasks be equally divided into each month, or should more be allocated to the first two months and less to the last month? Or should less be done in October and November, and more in December? Adopting an egalitarian approach is certainly not a good method, and pushing the tasks back to the last month for a rush is even worse. The best approach is to strive to move forward as much as possible, and try to complete more in October and November, striving to complete the three months' tasks in two and a half months or even less, so as to squeeze out time and free up resources to prepare for production in the first quarter of next year.

Chairman Mao told us that we should despise the enemy strategically, but we must take the enemy seriously in battles and tactics to win every battle. Production is like fighting a war. From a global perspective, we must despise all difficulties and be full of confidence in overfulfilling the national plan. However, when making specific work arrangements, we must pay attention to every specific problem, not push the tasks back, or place our hopes on the last moment, but should strive to move forward as much as possible and complete the tasks ahead of schedule. We must be vigilant from beginning to end, and must never be lax in the beginning and tense at the end, especially in the fourth quarter. Because December is the last month of the year, on the one hand, we must complete the tasks of the current month, and on the other hand, and more importantly, we must prepare for production in the first quarter of next year. Discussions on plans, research on measures, equipment maintenance, preparation of tools, raw materials, etc., must all be properly arranged. If too many production tasks are placed in this month to complete, then cadres and workers will not be able to spare the time to do the preparation work for the next year, which will inevitably affect the progress of the production tasks for the next year. This is passive whether viewed from the perspective of completing this year's production tasks or from the perspective of production preparation for next year. Conversely, if we strive to move the production tasks forward as much as possible, and strive to complete more tasks in October and November, then in December, we can better overfulfill the national plan and free up more time and resources to prepare for the first quarter of next year. This is proactive whether viewed from the perspective of this year or next year. Therefore, placing the focus of completing the fourth quarter's production tasks on the months of October and November, and being vigilant and striving to make the daily production level exceed the average level of the entire quarter from the first ten days and the first day of the fourth quarter is a leadership method that wins every battle. Steel enterprises, coal, transportation, and other industrial and mining enterprises, and construction enterprises must all adopt this method.

The situation on the industrial production, transportation, and capital construction fronts is very good now. The average daily production level of major industrial products such as steel, iron, and coal continues to rise steadily. Leading comrades at all levels go deep into the front line of production, eat, live, work, and discuss with the workers, and have effectively solved many specific problems and strengthened the leadership of the work teams. The broad masses of employees have been mobilized, are high-spirited, and actively participate in the labor competition based on work teams, and are vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution. The material and technical outlook of enterprises and the spiritual outlook of people are changing. Our direction is correct, and the foundation of the increase production and practice economy movement is solid. As long as we continue to be full of energy, go deep into the front line of production, solve new problems in a timely manner, summarize and promote the advanced experience of advanced work teams in a timely manner, and summarize and promote those effective new experiences and technologies that have a direct impact on solving the current key to production, continue to produce more coal, transport more coal, produce more iron, transport more iron, continue to reduce the coke ratio, save coal, reduce the consumption of pig iron, and produce more good steel, then we can complete more production tasks in October and November, and better grasp the initiative to overfulfill and complete ahead of schedule the industrial production plan centered on steel, iron, and coal.

The fourth quarter has passed for more than ten days, and the effectiveness of time is entirely in our own hands. We must grasp it well and strive to move the completion of the fourth quarter's production tasks forward as much as possible.

    尽量往前赶
    第四季度对于工业生产、交通运输和基本建设来讲，是个极重要的季度。在这个季度里，我们要尽最大的努力超额和提前完成全年的国家计划，同时又要为明年第一季度的生产做好许多具体的准备工作。为今天又为明天，两套锣鼓一齐敲，任务是十分艰巨的。要顺利完成这些任务，需要全体职工再接再厉，鼓足干劲；也需要企业的领导同志讲究工作方法，善于正确地安排这三个月的生产和工作。
    怎样正确地安排今年最后三个月的生产呢？是把全季任务平均分摊在每个月，还是头两个月多分些，最后一个月少分些？或者是十、十一月少干些，十二月多干些？采用平均主义的办法，固然不是好办法，把任务往后推，推到最后一个月去突击，更不是上策。最好的办法是尽量往前赶，力争在十月十一月多完成些，争取三个月的任务在两个半月或者更短一些时间内完成，以便挤出时间、腾出力量，为明年第一季度生产做好准备。
    毛主席告诉我们，要在战略上藐视敌人，但在战役和战术上必须重视敌人，才能百战百胜。生产和打仗一样，从全局看，我们要藐视一切困难，对超额完成国家计划满怀信心，但在具体安排工作的时候，必须重视每一个具体问题，不能把任务往后推，把希望寄托在最后的时刻，而应当尽量往前赶，尽量提前完成任务。我们要自始至终抓紧，决不能前松后紧，在第四季度，尤其是这样。因为十二月份是一年的最后一个月份，一方面要完成当月的任务，另一方面，也是更重要的方面，要为明年第一季度的生产准备工作，如讨论计划、研究措施、检修设备、准备工具、原料材料等等，都要做好妥善的安排。如果把过多的生产任务放在这个月来完成，那么，干部和工人就都分不出手来做下一年的准备工作，那就不能不影响下一年的生产任务的进行。这无论从完成今年的生产任务看，或者从明年的生产准备工作看，都很被动。相反，如果把生产任务尽量往前赶，争取十月十一月完成更多的任务，那么到十二月，就可以更好地超额完成国家计划，而且可以腾出更多的时间和力量来做明年第一季的准备工作。这无论从今年看，或者从明年看，都很主动。所以，把完成第四季度生产任务的重点放在十月和十一月两个月上，从四季度的第一旬、第一天起，就抓紧，就争取日产水平超过全季的平均水平，这是一个百战百胜的领导方法。钢铁企业、煤炭、交通运输和其他工矿企业、建筑企业，都要采取这个方法。
    现在工业生产、交通运输、基本建设战线上的形势是非常好的。钢、铁、煤等主要工业产品的平均日产水平，继续稳定上升。各级领导同志深入生产第一线，和工人同吃同住同劳动同商量，切切实实解决了许多具体问题，加强了班组的领导。广大职工群众已经动员了起来，意气风发，积极参加了以班组为基础的劳动竞赛，大搞技术革新、技术革命。企业的物质技术面貌和人的精神面貌，正在起着变化。我们的方向是对头的，增产节约运动的基础是牢固的。只要我们继续鼓足干劲，深入生产第一线，及时地解决新出现的问题，及时地总结和推广先进班组的先进经验，及时地总结和推广那些行之有效的、对解决当前生产关键有直接作用的新经验、新技术，继续多产煤，多调煤，多产铁，多调铁，继续降低焦比，节约煤炭，降低生铁的消耗，多产好钢，那就可以在十月十一月完成更多的生产任务，更好地掌握住超额完成和提前完成以钢、铁、煤为中心的工业生产计划的主动权。
    第四季度已过了十几天，时间的效能完全在我们自己手里，要好好地掌握着，要把完成第四季度的生产任务尽量往前赶。
