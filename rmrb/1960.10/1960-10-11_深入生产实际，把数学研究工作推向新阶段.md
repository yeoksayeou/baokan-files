Going Deep into Production Practice to Push Mathematical Research to a New Stage
Fan Wanqing, Secretary of the General Party Branch of the Mathematics Department of Jilin Normal University

Can mathematical research be linked to production practice? Can the mass line be implemented? Can there be a Great Leap Forward in mathematics? These are questions that the mathematical community has not resolved for a long time.

In 1958, under the leadership of the Party Committee, our department launched a debate on "Can Mathematics be Linked to Production Practice," studying Chairman Mao's works while debating. In this way, the majority of people clearly recognized that the emergence and development of mathematics is not "theory - theory - theory," but "practice - theory - practice." Subsequently, according to the decision of the Party Committee, we organized the vast number of teachers and students to go deep into more than two hundred factories, mines, enterprises, people's communes and scientific research institutions in Changchun, Jilin, Harbin and other places, combined with production practice, carried out mass scientific research activities, solved a large number of mathematical problems in production practice, learned, summarized, and promoted some inventions and creations in the technical revolution movement, and even researched and solved some cutting-edge topics. On this basis, we carried out basic theoretical research in mathematics and actively explored new mathematical theories. This kind of research has further promoted teaching reform. Below are some of our specific experiences:

Going Deep into Reality, Improving Theory

Solving the question of whether mathematics should be linked to production and how to combine with production is a process of ideological struggle.

When we first went deep into production practice, due to the lack of necessary preparation by the production units, and we did not understand production knowledge, we could not raise mathematical problems from production practice, especially not higher mathematics problems. Some people believed that there were indeed no mathematical problems in production practice, at least no higher mathematics problems, and did not see that this was a reflection of mathematics being divorced from production practice for a long time. In fact, as long as we truly go deep, various mathematical problems, including higher mathematics problems, will appear in large numbers. For example, the operations research group contacted relevant units such as transportation for many times at the beginning, and did not get any topics for a long time. Later, they further contacted the provincial and municipal transportation companies and went deep into the actual transportation work to learn relevant business knowledge such as transportation scheduling methods. As a result, problems came in an endless stream, and they discovered the dragon network and many other mathematical topics worth studying that the transportation department had created in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. After active research, the research results of rational waterway transportation alone can save the country 400,000 yuan. At the same time, they also gained some practical knowledge in planning mathematics, which in turn promoted the in-depth development of research work.

Solving mathematical problems in production practice often requires relevant production knowledge. This raises the question of supplementing knowledge in front of us; it also raises the question of the qualifications of mathematical workers. If we do not change the state of mathematicians who only understand abstract theory, it is impossible to solve the mathematical problems raised in production practice. For example, the dam stress research group did not understand what a "dam" was when they first accepted the research task, and could not even understand the diagram of the "dam," let alone propose stress analysis. In this case, it is impossible to carry out research work without mastering production knowledge. Later, they gradually supplemented relevant production knowledge such as "dam" and elasticity theory, and quickly completed the research task.

There is also the question of how to divide research organizations. Should research organizations be divided mainly according to production categories? Or should research organizations be divided mainly according to disciplines combined with production practice? This question is also linked to the establishment of what kind of mathematical science system. The task of universities is to focus on theoretical knowledge education, so we must combine with production practice mainly according to disciplines. However, some of the old theoretical systems are not fully adapted to the new situation, and we cannot be excessively constrained by the old theoretical systems of the past. At present, our approach is: neither starting from the old three lines of algebra, geometry, and analysis, nor using production categories as the standard, but basing on the existing new disciplines, such as computational mathematics, statistical mathematics, differential equations, and other systems, to connect with production practice, and developing new theoretical sprouts of these disciplines in the process of connecting with production practice, in order to explore new theoretical systems.

There is also the question of the selection criteria for mathematical research topics. We believe that topic selection should not affect going deep into reality in any way. Any practice that affects going deep into reality will ultimately affect the improvement of theory. Therefore, we must grasp the mathematical problems that need to be solved urgently in production, especially in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and actively research and solve them. This is the test standard for whether it is thoroughly combining with reality or half-combining with reality, truly combining with reality or falsely combining with reality. At the same time, problems that urgently need to be solved have the conditions for solving problems that are maturing: the process of solving these problems can mobilize the positive factors of all aspects, so they can often achieve results quickly and open up the situation. We must not pursue mathematical cutting-edge issues by being divorced from production practice.

Many facts prove that going deep into production practice is an important condition for improving theory. This is also the principle that practice produces science. With the vigorous development of production and construction and the technical revolution movement, the field of mathematical research is constantly expanding, and data is constantly enriching. As long as we gather the gains from combining with production practice, classify and arrange them, and comprehensively refine them, we will discover new theories.

Widely Mobilizing the Masses, Developing Research Work at High Speed

In scientific research work, we must not only mobilize the masses of teachers, but also mobilize the masses of students. The mass line is the basic line for developing science. The achievements of our department in scientific research in the past two years fully prove this point. After scientific research goes deep into production practice, not only are there more topics, and many large topics have emerged, but also some topics are more comprehensive and involve a wider range of business, which cannot be completed by a few teachers, students, or a certain major. We must organize various disciplines and all teachers and students to cooperate with each other in order to carry out research work. Therefore, for some relatively major topics, we have adopted the method of organizing relevant disciplines to concentrate efforts to solve them. For example, the statistical mathematics teaching and research section used the linear extrapolation theory of stationary random functions to solve the problem of long-term numerical weather forecasting. They encountered an 18th-order algebraic equation. They only knew the elimination method, but the more they calculated with the elimination method, the more troublesome it became. Later, with the participation of comrades in computational mathematics, they quickly solved the problem using the Seidel method.

Some major research topics not only require the cooperation of all aspects, but also require a long time to complete. However, students are mobile. In the past, because we had no experience, some research projects were interrupted or the existing research results could not be effectively used because the students who participated in the research had left school. This requires strengthening the "relay" work in scientific research. At present, in our department, "relay" arrangements have been gradually made for research topics such as dam stress calculation, thin shell calculation, transportation, automobile industry, and weather forecasting: with teachers as the backbone, with senior students as the main force, and at the same time absorbing junior students to participate. In this way, on the one hand, senior students can drive junior students in scientific research, and on the other hand, junior students can take over the scientific research of senior students in the future, which ensures that the research of these topics will not be interrupted.

The mass scientific research movement is also a mass movement to improve teaching quality. Students participating in scientific research work can not only learn a lot of production knowledge, but also learn new mathematical knowledge. According to the survey of the typhoon forecasting group in the fourth grade alone, in the three months, combined with research, they not only reviewed the mathematical knowledge they had learned, such as harmonic functions, integral equations, calculation methods, and difference equations, but also learned Green's function, spherical functions, V-type multidimensional integral equations, methods of converting differential equations into integrals, and many more important and newer mathematical knowledge such as Euler's equations in dynamic meteorology; and further understood the internal connections of many or one course, so that they can organically connect them horizontally; learned to comprehensively use these knowledge, cultivated the ability to solve practical problems; and rapidly changed the situation in the past where they felt difficult even with simple exercises, and changed the situation in the past where they did not apply what they learned.

To Scale the Peaks of Science, We Must Scale the Peaks of Ideology

The mass scientific research work is of great benefit to overcoming the individualism of scientific workers and changing the research path and research methods that are divorced from reality and divorced from the masses. Of course, collective research cannot naturally overcome individualistic fame and gain thinking. Solving the relationship between the individual and the collective is still a process of struggle. Individualistic fame and gain thinking in collective research is sometimes manifested as competing for big topics and disliking small topics; sometimes it is manifested as being willing to do the main research work but unwilling to do auxiliary and cooperative research work; sometimes it is manifested as engaging in personal reading in the name of finding materials. These manifestations of individualistic thinking all play a negative role in scientific research. The high degree of collectivity in scientific research work requires scientific workers to have both grand ambitions and a spirit of dedication to be a good screw in specific work. This requires that in mass research work, we must give prominence to politics and use proletarian collectivist thinking to overcome bourgeois individualistic thinking. To scale the peaks of science, we must scale the peaks of ideology.

Therefore, in scientific research work, we must give prominence to politics. We grasp business with one hand and politics with the other; ideological mobilization comes first before scientific research begins; we strengthen ideological work in the research process; we seize the ideological summary after scientific research has reached a certain stage. In a certain period and within a certain range, we carry out scientific research rectification activities, affirm achievements, check problems, summarize experiences, and continue to leap forward.

Scientific research work is creative labor, and creative labor is always produced on the basis of a large amount of ordinary repetitive labor. A conclusive number sometimes even requires tens of thousands of calculations; sometimes a problem cannot be correctly concluded after several days of discussion; sometimes an error is suddenly discovered after a number has been calculated thousands of times, and it must be recalculated. It can be said that every success in scientific research is linked to failure. In the face of difficulties, we must do as Chairman Mao instructed, despise difficulties strategically and pay attention to difficulties tactically. For example, the research group on the stress distribution of rolling mill frames did not understand what a rolling mill was or what stress was when they first accepted the research task, and there was no way to conduct research. However, they first despised this difficulty and were not intimidated by the difficulty. Then, they paid attention to all the specific difficulties in this research, went deep into reality in a down-to-earth manner, conducted detailed investigations and research on the spot, summarized experiences, and overcame the difficulties one by one, and gradually accumulated experience. As a result, they not only solved the research task, but also theoretically changed "multiply connected" into "singly connected," breaking the framework that it must be mapped into a regular curve to compare. The liberation of thought promoted the research work, and in the process of research work, some unrealistic ideas were further overcome, which in turn guided people to greater ideological liberation.

In order to strengthen political leadership, we also studied Comrade Mao Zedong's works in the process of carrying out scientific research, and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide scientific research work. For example, the automobile cam curve research group failed more than 60 times in more than a month, and many problems could not be solved. Later, they collectively studied Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" and turned the mathematics discussion meeting into a philosophy discussion meeting. They delved into science and then came out to study Chairman Mao's works. After going in and out repeatedly, in the face of a large number of problems, they finally discovered that solving the "ordinary curve" problem was solving the main contradiction. As a result, after making the "ordinary curve," they quickly solved the lift curve of the cam, and made some theoretical development. This proves that although politics cannot replace science, politics can determine the development of science, and giving prominence to politics can produce science.

In the past two years, after practice, criticism, and reform, we have gradually carried out curriculum reform. In the process of reform, we studied "On Contradiction," "On Practice" and "Dialectics of Nature" and other works, and continuously improved our ideological understanding, and criticized the old scientific system. For example, disciplines such as differential equations, mathematical analysis, algebra, and geometry have been newly explored in terms of the guiding ideology, research objects, main contradictions, and logical structure of the discipline system, and the old system has been criticized and reformed, and the quality of teaching has been improved.

On the existing basis, we are determined to push mathematical scientific research to a new stage, that is, to unite scientific criticism, inheritance, and creation in a planned and step-by-step manner, move forward step by step, and explore new theories and new disciplines.

    深入生产实际，把数学研究工作推向新阶段
    中共吉林师范大学数学系总支书记　樊万清
    数学的研究工作能不能联系生产实际？能不能贯彻群众路线？能不能大跃进？这是数学界长时间没有解决的问题。
    1958年，我们系在党委领导下，展开了一场“数学能不能联系生产实际”的论战，一边辩论，一边学习毛主席著作。这样，多数人明确认识到数学的产生和发展不是“理论—理论—理论”，而是“实践—理论—实践”。接着，根据党委的决定，我们组织广大师生深入到长春、吉林、哈尔滨等地二百多个厂矿企业、人民公社和科学研究机关，结合生产实际，开展了群众性的科学研究活动，解决了生产实际当中大量的数学课题，学习、总结、推广了技术革命运动中的一些发明创造，甚至还研究解决了一些尖端课题。在这个基础上开展了数学的基本理论研究工作，积极地进行了数学新理论的探索工作。这种研究工作还进一步推动了教学改革。下面谈谈我们的一些具体的体会：
    深入实际，提高理论
    解决数学要不要联系生产的问题，以及如何结合生产的问题是一个思想斗争的过程。
    当我们刚深入生产实际的时候，由于生产单位缺乏必要的准备，我们又不懂生产知识，不能从生产实际中提出数学问题来，尤其提不出高等数学问题来，有些人就认为生产实际中的确没有数学问题，至少没有高等数学问题，而没有看到这正是数学长期脱离生产实际的反映。其实，只要真正深入下去，各种数学问题，包括高等数学问题就会大量出现。譬如，运筹学研究小组，开始时与交通运输等有关单位联系多次，很长时间没有得到题目，后来与省、市运输公司进一步取得联系，并深入到运输工作实际中去，学习了运输调度法等有关业务知识，结果问题源源而来，发现了运输部门在技术革新、技术革命运动中所创造的龙网化和其他许多值得研究的数学课题。经过积极研究以后，仅合理水运量的研究成果，就可为国家节约四十万元。同时还获得了规划数学方面的一些实际知识，反过来推动了研究工作的深入发展。
    解决生产实际中的数学课题，往往要求具备有关的生产知识。这就在我们面前提出了一个补习知识的问题；同时也提出了数学工作者的规格问题。如果不改变数学家只懂得抽象理论的状态，就不可能解决生产实际当中提出的数学课题。例如：水坝应力研究小组，他们在开始接受研究任务时，“坝”是什么不懂，“坝”的图也看不懂，至于提出应力分析则根本办不到。在这种情况下，不掌握生产知识就根本无法进行研究工作。后来他们逐步地补上了“坝”和弹性理论等有关生产知识，很快就完成了研究任务。
    这里还有一个问题，就是如何划分研究组织的问题，究竟是以生产门类为主划分研究组织呢？还是以学科划类为主结合生产实际划分研究组织呢？这个问题又与建立什么样的数学科学体系联系在一起。高等学校的任务是以理论知识教育为主，因而我们必须以学科划类为主去联系生产实际。可是旧的理论体系有些已经与新的情况不能完全适应，而我们又不能过分受过去旧的理论体系所约束。目前我们的做法是：既不从过去的代数、几何、分析三线出发，也不以生产门类为准，而是以已有的新的学科，如计算数学、统计数学、微分方程等体系为基础去联系生产实际，并在联系生产实际的过程中发展这些学科理论的新苗头，以便探索新的理论体系。
    还有数学研究的选题标准问题，我们认为选题无论如何不能影响深入实际，任何影响深入实际的做法，最终都要影响理论的提高。因此，我们必须抓住生产中特别是技术革新、技术革命运动中迫切需要解决的数学课题，积极地加以研究解决。这是彻底结合实际还是半结合实际，真结合实际还是假结合实际的检验标准。同时，迫切需要解决的问题，它本身就具有正在成熟着的解决问题的条件：这些问题的解决过程，最能调动各方面的积极因素，因而往往能够较快地获得成果，打开局面。千万不能脱离生产实际追求数学尖端。
    许多事实证明，深入生产实际是提高理论的重要条件，这也是实践出科学的道理。随着生产建设事业和技术革命运动的蓬勃发展，数学研究领域不断扩大，资料不断丰富，只要我们把结合生产实际所得到的收获，不断汇集起来，进行分类排队，综合提炼，就会发现新的理论。
    广泛发动群众，高速度地开展研究工作
    在科学研究工作中，既必须发动教师群众，也必须发动学生群众。群众路线是发展科学的基本路线。两年来，我们系的科学研究的成就，充分证明了这一点。当科学研究深入生产实际以后，不仅课题多起来了，出现了不少大的课题，而且有些课题综合性比较大，牵涉业务范围比较广，不是少数教师、学生或某个专业所能完成的，必须组织各个学科和全体师生互相配合，研究工作才能开展。因此我们对于一些比较重大的课题，采取了组织有关学科，集中力量解决的办法。如统计数学教研室利用平稳随机函数线性外推理论解决长期气象数值预报问题，遇到18阶代数方程，他们只懂消去法，但用消去法越算越麻烦，后来在计算数学的同志参加下，用赛德尔方法，很快就解决了问题。
    有些重大的研究课题不但需要各个方面配合，而且需要较长时间才能完成。可是学生具有流动性。过去由于我们没有经验，有的研究项目，因为参加研究的学生已经离校，造成研究工作中断或不能有效运用已有研究成果的现象。这就要求加强科学研究中的“接力”工作。目前在我们系，对于水坝应力计算、薄壳计算、交通运输、汽车工业、气象预报等方面的研究课题，都逐步做了“接力”的安排：以教师为基干，以高年级学生为主力，同时吸收低年级学生参加。这样，一方面高年级在科学研究方面可以带动低年级，另一方面，将来低年级又可以接替高年级的科学研究，这就保证了这些课题的研究不会中断。
    群众性的科学研究运动，也是一个群众性的提高教学质量的运动。学生参加科学研究工作，不仅可以学到大量的生产知识，而且可以学到新的数学知识。仅就四年级台风预报小组的调查，他们在三个月的时间里，结合研究，不仅复习了学过的调和函数、积分方程、计算方法、差分方程等数学知识，而且学习了格林函数、球函数、V型多维积分方程、微分方程化积分的方法，以及动力气象学中的欧拉方程等许多较重要较新的数学知识；并进一步了解了许多门或一门课的多方面的内在联系，从而从横的方面把它们有机地联系起来；学会综合利用这些知识，培养了解决实际问题的工作能力；迅速地改变着过去那种连简单习题都感到困难的情况，改变着过去那种学不致用的状况。
    要科学登高峰，必须思想登高峰
    群众性的科学研究工作，对克服科学工作者的个人主义思想，和改变那种脱离实际、脱离群众的研究道路和研究方法有很大好处的。当然，集体研究并不能自然地克服个人主义名利思想。解决个人和集体的关系问题，仍然还是一个斗争的过程。集体研究中的个人主义名利思想，有时表现为争大题厌小题；有时表现为愿做主要的研究工作而不愿做辅助配合的研究工作；有时表现为以找资料为名，搞个人读书之实。这些个人主义的思想表现，在科学研究中都起着抵消力量的坏作用。科学研究工作中的高度集体性，要求科学工作者既要有宏图大志，又要有在具体工作中做好螺丝钉的献身精神。这就要求我们在群众性的研究工作中，必须政治挂帅，用无产阶级集体主义思想，克服资产阶级个人主义思想。要科学登高峰，必须思想登高峰。
    因此，在科学研究工作中，必须政治挂帅。我们一手抓业务，一手抓政治；科学研究开始之前，思想动员先行；在研究过程中，加强思想工作；科学研究告一阶段，抓紧思想总结。在一定时期一定的范围内，开展科学研究整风活动，肯定成绩，检查问题，总结经验，继续跃进。
    科学研究工作是创造性的劳动，创造性的劳动总是在大量的平凡的重复性劳动的基础上产生的。一个结论性的数字，有时甚至需要上万次的计算；有时一个问题讨论几天得不到正确的结论；有时一个数字计算了几千次之后突然发现错误，又必须重新算起。可以说，科学研究的每个成功，又都是和失败联系在一起的。在困难面前，我们必须按照毛主席的指示去做，在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难。例如轧钢机机架应力分布研究小组，开始接受研究任务时，轧钢机是什么，什么叫应力都不懂，如何研究没有门路。但是他们首先藐视了这个困难，没有被困难所吓倒。接着又重视了这一研究中的一切具体困难，踏踏实实地深入实际，到现场做细致的调查研究，总结经验，一个个地克服了困难，一点点地积累起了经验，结果不仅解决了研究任务，而且在理论上把“复连通”变成“单连通”，打破了一定要映射成正规的曲线才能对比的框框。思想的解放，推动了研究工作，在研究工作的过程中进一步克服了一些不切实际的想法，又引导人们更大的思想解放。
    为了加强政治挂帅，我们在开展科学研究的过程中，还学习了毛泽东同志的著作，用毛泽东思想指导科学研究工作。如汽车凸轮曲线研究小组，在一个多月的时间里，他们失败了六十多次，许多问题解决不了。后来他们集体学习了毛主席的《矛盾论》，把数学讨论会变为哲学讨论会。他们钻进科学里，而后再出来学习毛主席著作，进去出来反复多次，在大量问题面前，终于发现了解决了“普通曲线”问题就是解决了主要矛盾。结果做出“普通曲线”以后，很快就解决了凸轮的升程曲线，而且在理论上有所发展。这就证明：政治虽然不能代替科学，但政治可以决定科学的发展，政治挂帅可以出科学。
    两年来，经过实践、批判、改革，我们逐步地进行了课程改革。在改革过程中，我们学习了《矛盾论》、《实践论》以及《自然辩证法》等著作，不断地提高思想认识，和批判旧的科学体系。如微分方程、数学分析、代数、几何等学科，从学科体系的指导思想、研究对象、主要矛盾、逻辑结构等方面都进行了新的探讨，批判、改革了旧的体系，提高了教学质量。
    在现有的基础上，我们决心把数学科学研究推向一个新的阶段，即有计划有步骤地把科学上的批判、继承和创造统一起来，步步向前推进，探索新的理论和新的学科的阶段。
