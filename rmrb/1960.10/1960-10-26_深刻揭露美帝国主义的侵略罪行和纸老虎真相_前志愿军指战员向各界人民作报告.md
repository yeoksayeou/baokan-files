Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: On the eve of "October 25th," many factories, schools, government offices, and military units across the country have invited former commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to give reports. These heroes, who once defeated the American aggressors alongside the Korean people, told hundreds of thousands of people: The Korean battlefield was the best classroom for us to deeply understand the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism, and a vivid place for the U.S. paper tiger to reveal its true form. The victory of the Korean War was achieved by the people of China and Korea, united and determined to fight against a common enemy, and with the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the people of all countries in the world.

At each meeting, the heroes used vivid facts from their personal experiences to profoundly expose the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism and the truth about the American "paper tiger." Pang Wenxue, former deputy instructor of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, who crossed the Yalu River on October 25th ten years ago, said at a gathering: At that time, the land in Korea occupied by the American bandits was full of fires, ruins, and the bodies of old people, women, and children killed by the American aggressors. We will never forget the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism. We went to kill the enemy with incomparable anger at that time. Former Volunteer Army soldier Zhang Zhenya said when exposing the enemy's crimes: The bestial acts of the American invading army aroused our deep hatred. I once shed tears in front of the body of a Korean child who was bombed to death by American planes, and silently vowed to avenge him.

The "tiger"-beating heroes all used a large number of facts to expose the truth about the American "paper tiger." Yan Chengen, a former Volunteer Army first-class hero and special-class meritorious person, said: In 1951, when our company was guarding Tiande Mountain, the American "ace army" – the 1st Cavalry Division – used dozens of artillery pieces, more than 20 tanks, and more than 10 aircraft to attack us continuously for three days. As a result, it gained nothing except for more than 800 casualties. Zhang Chenghai, a former Volunteer Army platoon leader, reported at a meeting about the situation of his company holding a mountain top, saying: Every time the American invading army attacked, they would first use planes to bomb, then artillery to shell, and then tanks to lead the way. But as soon as they approached the mountain top, our platoon’s grenades would beat them into howling ghosts, and they wouldn’t dare to attack again for a long time. We called it a "seemingly powerful straw bag" at the time. Su Wenlu, the instructor of the Eighth Company, which won the "Iron Company Defending Kaesong" banner in the Battle of Kaesong, said that in those years, they were stationed on a high ground next to Kaesong. In the early stage of the Panmunjom negotiations, the enemy was very arrogant, shouting about "air superiority" and "debating with bombs and artillery," and shamelessly demanded that we give up Kaesong. They attacked our position for eight days, but they did not advance a single step except for leaving behind a large number of corpses. Later, we launched a counterattack against the enemy, and advanced more than 20 li in a few days. Under the victory on the entire front, the enemy no longer called for "air superiority" and no longer asked us for Kaesong. He said: U.S. imperialism is such a "paper tiger."

At the report meeting, many former Volunteer Army personnel talked about the relationship between people and weapons in the war. Xu Henglu, a former Volunteer Army second-class hero and first-class meritorious person, said that when his unit drove the enemy from the Yalu River to the south bank of the Han River, 18 warriors of a vanguard platoon marched rapidly for two days and nights, took the lead in crossing the Qingchuan River, and intercepted more than 1,800 enemies who were trying to escape by car. The enemy was running on six wheels (cars), and we were chasing on two legs. As a result, we caught up ahead and wiped them all out. This shows that it is people who determine the outcome of the war. Guo Tingyou, deputy company commander of the Railway Corps "Yang Liandi" company, who is building roads on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, said: In order to destroy our railway lines, the enemy constantly sent planes to bomb and strafe, and also dropped a large number of time bombs and fragmentation bombs. But they bombed in front and we repaired behind. Although the enemy was extremely vicious, our transportation lines were always unimpeded. Li Yanwen, the deputy squad leader of the squad where hero Huang Jiguang was, also used the facts of the Battle of Shangganling to illustrate the truth that "the outcome of the war is determined by people." He said: Under the cover of a large number of planes, artillery, and tanks, the enemy used several divisions to attack our two hilltops. The stones on the top of the mountain were cut off by several feet, but our position stood firm. The reason is very simple, because those who defended the position were heroic fighters like Huang Jiguang.

At the report meeting, every commander and fighter of the former Volunteer Army also recalled with excitement the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people forged with blood. They said that during the days they fought side by side with the Korean people, they always received the enthusiastic support and cordial care of the Korean people. Chen Zaiben, a former Volunteer Army artillery squad leader, said: After a battle, I was left in the home of an old Korean woman because I was seriously ill. This old woman fed me, gave me water, and took care of my excrement and urine as if she loved her own children, which made me recover quickly.

These former Volunteer Army soldiers all said at every meeting that although we have been away from Korea for two years, our hearts are always with the Korean people.

    深刻揭露美帝国主义的侵略罪行和纸老虎真相
    前志愿军指战员向各界人民作报告
    新华社24日讯　“十·二五”前夕，全国各地许多工厂、学校、机关、部队，纷纷邀请前中国人民志愿军指战员作报告。这些曾经和朝鲜人民一起打败过美国侵略者的英雄们向成千上万的人们说：朝鲜战场是使我们深刻认识美帝国主义侵略本质的最好课堂，是美国纸老虎大显原形的生动场所。朝鲜战争的胜利，是朝中两国人民为反对共同敌人，团结一致，坚决斗争，并且在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和世界各国人民支持下所取得的。
    英雄们在每次会上，都用亲身经历的生动事实，深刻地揭露了美帝国主义的侵略罪行和美国“纸老虎”的真相。十年前10月25日跨过鸭绿江的前志愿军某部副指导员庞文学在一次集会上说：那时，朝鲜被美国强盗侵占的土地上到处是大火、废墟和被美国侵略者杀害的老人、妇女、小孩的尸体。美帝国主义的滔天罪行，我们永远不会忘记。我们当时是怀着无比的愤怒去杀敌的。前志愿军战士张振亚在揭露敌人罪行时说：美国侵略军的兽行，引起我们的切齿痛恨，我就曾经在一个被美国飞机炸死的朝鲜孩子的尸体跟前流过眼泪，并默默地宣誓要为他报仇雪恨。
    打“虎”英雄们都用了大量事实揭露美国“纸老虎”的真相。前志愿军一级英雄、特等功臣阎成恩说：1951年我们一个连守卫天德山的时候，美国的“王牌军”——骑一师用了几十门大炮，二十多辆坦克和十多架飞机向我们连续攻了三天，结果它除了死伤八百多人外一无所获。前志愿军某部排长张成海在一次报告会上报告他所在的连坚守一个山头的情形说：美国侵略军每次进攻都是先用飞机炸，再用大炮轰，然后由坦克开路，可是刚接近山头，我们一排手榴弹就把它打得鬼哭狼嚎，很久不敢再攻。我们当时叫它是“貌似强大的草包”。曾在开城保卫战中荣获“保卫开城钢铁连队”锦旗的八连指导员苏文禄说，当年，他们守在开城旁边的一个高地上，在板门店谈判初期，敌人非常嚣张，大叫什么“空中优势”，“用炸弹、大炮辩论”，并无耻地要我们让出开城，向我们阵地就攻了八天，结果它除了丢下大批尸体以外，没有前进一步。以后我们向敌人发起反击，几天就前进了二十多里。在全线的胜利下，敌人再不叫“空中优势”，也不向我们要开城了。他说：美帝国主义就是这样一个“纸老虎”。
    报告会上，许多前志愿军人员讲了战争中人与武器的关系。前志愿军二级英雄、一等功臣徐恒禄说，他所在部队从鸭绿江边一直把敌人赶到汉江南岸时，一个尖刀排的十八勇士，急行军两昼夜，抢先渡过了清川江，把一千八百多名企图乘汽车逃跑的敌人截住了。敌人坐的是六个轮子（汽车）跑，我们靠两条腿追，结果我们赶在前面，把它全部歼灭。这说明了决定战争胜负的是人。正在云贵高原修路的铁道兵“杨连第”连副连长郭廷友说：敌人为了破坏我们的铁路线，不断派飞机轰炸、扫射，还投下大批定时炸弹、杀伤弹，可是它前面炸我们后面修，敌人虽然穷凶极恶，可是我们的运输线却始终畅通无阻。英雄黄继光所在班的副班长李彦文还用上甘岭战役的事实说明
  “战争胜负决定于人”的真理。他说：敌人在大量飞机、大炮、坦克的掩护下，用几个师的兵力，攻我们两个山头，山顶上的石头被削去几尺，可是我们的阵地屹立未动，这个道理很简单，就是因为守卫阵地的都是像黄继光一样的英雄战士。
    在报告会上，前志愿军的每个指战员还都激动地回忆着中朝人民用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊。他们说，他们在与朝鲜人民并肩作战的日子里，时刻都得到朝鲜人民的热情支援和亲切关怀。前志愿军炮兵某部班长陈在本说：在一次战斗结束以后，我因为患重病被留在一位朝鲜老大娘家里，这位老人像爱护自己儿女一样给我喂饭、送水、端屎端尿，使我很快恢复了健康。
    这些前志愿军战士在每个会上都说，我们虽然离开朝鲜两年，但是我们的心永远和朝鲜人民在一起。
