Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th - The Lao Fighting Forces Radio broadcast today: Fifteen hundred people from all walks of life in Sam Neua City and nearby areas held a rally on October 3rd to celebrate Sam Neua's successful liberation from the rule of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique and to express their condolences to the heroic forces that liberated Sam Neua. At the rally, the heads of the Sam Neua Provincial Government met with the people and were warmly cheered and supported by the people.

The representative of the Sam Neua Provincial Government spoke at the meeting about the great significance of Sam Neua's liberation from the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique. People's representatives from Sam Neua City also spoke at the meeting, condemning the brutal crimes of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Naciampsasak traitorous clique's pawns, and pledging that people from all walks of life will unite closely to support the Phouma government and the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le's policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, and resolutely defend Sam Neua to protect it from further invasion by the traitorous clique.

After the meeting, a demonstration was held, with demonstrators chanting slogans such as "Celebrating the Victory of Sam Neua" and "Welcoming the troops who defeated the Phoumi-Boun Oum clique and their pawns."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 6th - According to a broadcast by Vientiane Radio today, Vientiane monks expressed support for the Phouma government's policy of peace and neutrality in a recent letter to monks nationwide, while condemning the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique.

The letter to monks nationwide stated that all the people and monks of Laos support the Phouma government in pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality in the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We reaffirm that this neutrality is fully in line with the principles and guidelines of Buddhist scriptures.

The letter to monks said, however, that some rogues and thieves have betrayed the motherland, religion, the king, and the constitution. These thieves are precisely the leaders of the "Revolutionary Committee" in Savannakhet. They are carrying out so-called "revolution" in Savannakhet to undermine the policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony.

The letter to monks exposed that the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique "dispatches some pawns to shave their heads, put on yellow robes, impersonate monks, and sneak into Vientiane in order to sabotage the capital Vientiane and assassinate people who love the country and peace." The letter to monks called on all troops and police to oppose the above conspiracy.

    新华社河内6日电　据万象电台今天广播，万象僧侣在最近发表的一篇告全国僧侣书表示支持富马政府奉行和平中立政策，同时谴责富米·诺萨万叛国集团。
    告全国僧侣书说，老挝全体人民和僧侣支持富马政府根据和平共处五项原则的精神，奉行和平中立政策。我们再次认定这种中立完全符合佛经的原则和路线。
    告僧侣书说，但是，一些流氓、盗贼背叛了祖国、宗教、国王和宪法。这些盗贼正是沙湾拿吉的“革命委员会”的头目们。他们正在沙湾拿吉干所谓“革命”，来破坏和平中立和民族和睦政策。
    告僧侣书揭露富米·诺萨万叛国集团“派遣一些爪牙把头发剃光，穿上黄色袈裟，冒充僧侣，潜入万象，以破坏首都万象和暗杀爱祖国、爱和平的人”。告僧侣书呼吁全体军队和警察反对上述阴谋。
