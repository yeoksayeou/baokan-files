    Congratulations on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between China and Mali
    On October 27th, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Mali jointly issued a joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations, and decided to send diplomatic representatives at the ambassadorial level to each other. The Chinese people are extremely happy to hear this news.
    The friendship between the Chinese and Malian people is profound. We have always sympathized with and supported the Malian people's persistent struggle for national independence. Similarly, the Malian people have always shown sincere friendship to the Chinese people. Especially after the establishment of the Republic of Mali, the friendly relations between the Malian and Chinese people have had full opportunities for development. We are pleased to see that at this session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Republic of Mali, despite the obstruction of the United States, resolutely advocated including the issue of restoring China's seat in the United Nations on the agenda of the General Assembly. Not long ago, Modibo Keita, Prime Minister of the Republic of Mali, sent a telegram to Premier Zhou Enlai of our country, announcing the recognition of the People's Republic of China as an independent and sovereign country, and then severed diplomatic relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Modibo Keita, President of the Republic of Mali, also recently received Ke Hua, our country's ambassador to Guinea, and had friendly talks with him. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mali is a natural result of the development of this friendly relationship. There is no doubt that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mali is entirely in line with the common interests of our two peoples. As President Modibo Keita recently pointed out in a letter to Ke Hua, our country's ambassador to Guinea, "I assure you that the ambassadorial-level diplomatic relations that will soon be established between our two countries will be further strengthened in accordance with the interests of the people of both countries, and will help to maintain world peace and security."
    The formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mali marks the further development of friendly relations between China and newly independent African countries. This is independent of the wishes of the imperialists. As everyone knows, in order to antagonize China, US imperialism has long spread slanderous rumors about China among African countries, and has viciously played the "two Chinas" conspiracy. However, the despicable conspiracy of imperialism has been seen through by more and more Africans. At this session of the United Nations General Assembly, despite the United States' efforts with the newly independent African countries, the voting results on the issue of restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations showed that none of the newly joined African member states supported the United States. Mali, Senegal, and Nigeria voted against the US proposal, and twelve other African countries abstained. The newly born Republic of Mali has now, after successful and friendly negotiations with the People's Republic of China, announced the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, which once again declares the bankruptcy of the US imperialist conspiracy to isolate China. Facts have proved that because the Chinese and African people share the common historical experience of being plundered and oppressed by imperialism for a long time, and have the common desire to rapidly build their own motherlands after independence, our friendship will surely develop more with the passage of time.
    The Chinese people are very excited to see that the newly born Republic of Mali has won a series of achievements in maintaining and consolidating national independence. We believe that with the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries, our two peoples will achieve further cooperation and mutual support in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace. The economic and cultural ties between our two countries will also increase day by day. We wish the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Mali a long-term development on the existing good foundation.

    祝贺中国马里建交
    10月27日，中华人民共和国和马里共和国共同发表了建立外交关系的联合公报，并且决定互派大使级的外交代表。消息传来，中国人民感到无比高兴。
    中国人民和马里人民的友情是深厚的。我们一贯同情和支持马里人民为争取民族独立而进行的坚韧不懈的斗争。同样的，马里人民一直对中国人民表现了诚挚的友情。特别是在马里共和国成立以后，马里人民和中国人民之间的友好关系，已有了充分发展的可能。我们高兴地看到，在这一届联合国大会上，马里共和国不顾美国的阻挠，毅然主张把恢复中国在联合国席位问题列入大会议程。不久以前，马里共和国总理莫迪博·凯塔致电我国周恩来总理，宣布承认中华人民共和国为独立自主的国家，接着又断绝了同蒋介石集团的外交关系。马里共和国总统莫迪博·凯塔最近还接见了我国驻几内亚大使柯华，并和他进行了友好的谈话。中国和马里建立外交关系，正是这种友好关系发展的必然结果。毫无疑问，中、马建交是完全符合我们两国人民的共同利益的。正如莫迪博·凯塔总统最近在写给我国驻几内亚大使柯华的信件中所指出，“我向你保证，我们两国间即将建立的大使级的外交关系将在符合于两国人民利益的基础上进一步加强，并且将有助于维护世界的和平和安全。”
    中国和马里两国间外交关系的正式建立，标志着中国和非洲新独立国家之间的友好关系正在进一步发展。这是不以帝国主义者的愿望为转移的。大家知道，美帝国主义为了敌视中国，长期以来在非洲国家间散播诬蔑中国的谰言，并且恶毒地玩弄着“两个中国”的阴谋。但是，帝国主义的卑鄙阴谋已经为非洲越来越多的人所识破。在这一届联合国大会上，尽管美国对新独立的非洲国家做了许多工作，但是，关于对恢复中国在联合国合法席位问题的投票结果表明，所有新加入联合国的非洲会员国都没有支持美国。马里共和国、塞内加尔和尼日利亚投票反对美国提案，其他十二个非洲国家弃权。而新生的马里共和国现在又和中华人民共和国经过顺利的友好谈判，宣告两国正式建立了外交关系，这就再一次宣告美帝国主义孤立中国的阴谋的破产。事实证明，由于中国人民和非洲人民有着遭受帝国主义长期掠夺和压迫的共同的历史遭遇，有着在独立以后迅速建设自己祖国的共同愿望，因而，我们的友谊必将随着岁月的转移而得到更大的发展。
    中国人民十分兴奋地看到，新生的马里共和国在维护和巩固民族独立方面赢得了一系列的成就。我们相信，随着我们两国间外交关系的正式建立，我们两国人民在反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的斗争中，将会取得进一步的合作和相互支持。我们两国之间的经济、文化联系，也将日益增进。祝中国和马里的友好合作关系，在已有的良好基础上，获得长足的进展。
