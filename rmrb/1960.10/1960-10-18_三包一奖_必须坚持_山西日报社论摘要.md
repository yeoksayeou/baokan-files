	"Three Guarantees and One Reward" Must Be Adhered To
	—Abstract of Shanxi Daily Editorial
	The core issue in implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system at present is the issue of fulfillment. The experience of the Jicun Management District is particularly noteworthy because they seized the opportune moment. At the beginning of the autumn harvest (rather than after the autumn harvest, let alone next spring), they systematically summarized the experience of implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system in the summer and announced the implementation plan for the autumn crop "Three Guarantees and One Reward". In this way, it dispelled people's doubts about whether the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system would be implemented, turned the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system into a vibrant system, greatly promoted production, and mobilized the enthusiasm of the commune members. Both the production team cadres and the commune members are actively striving to exceed the guaranteed output.
	Seizing the opportune moment means grasping the regularity of work, as we usually say. Because the Jicun Management District grasped the regularity of "Three Guarantees and One Reward" being contracted in the spring and implemented in the autumn (wheat is contracted in the autumn and implemented in the summer), they seized the best opportunity to ensure the fulfillment of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system. Therefore, they promoted the mass movement of careful harvesting and threshing to strive for overproduction, and ensured that no grain ears were lost during harvesting and transportation, and no grains were lost during threshing and storage. In the past, many areas often combined the experience of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system with the formulation of the next year's guaranteed output plan after the autumn harvest, which naturally benefited the production in the second year, but it was not closely linked to the production of the current year and did not play a significant role in promoting the production of the current year. The Jicun Management District announced the trial calculation plan for the fulfillment of "Three Guarantees and One Reward" during the autumn harvest, which made up for this deficiency. Therefore, it is hoped that all regions will, like Fenyang and Wenshui, conduct a trial calculation of the fulfillment of "Three Guarantees and One Reward" in conjunction with the implementation and problems of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system in their respective districts and communes, and announce it to all commune members. At the same time, formulate the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" plan for next year. In this way, if this year's "Three Guarantees and One Reward" can be fulfilled, the commune members will be reassured and will continue to make persistent efforts to strive for more overproduction in the autumn harvest; and the formulation of next year's "Three Guarantees and One Reward" plan will also further encourage the confidence of the commune members and actively complete the autumn sowing plan for more overproduction next year.
	The implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, like the implementation of other systems, usually has three situations: one is flexible implementation, one is rigid implementation, and one is non-implementation. The reason why the experience of the Jicun Management District is so valuable is that they have flexibly implemented the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system. We know that engaging in agricultural production is dealing with "Mother Nature". There are unpredictable winds and rains. Under our existing material and technical conditions, we can already predict some "winds and rains", but there are still many "winds and rains" that cannot be predicted. Therefore, in the production process, it is inevitable that there will be a discrepancy between the "actual output" and the "guaranteed output". Flexible implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system means that when encountering situations where "output" does not match "guarantees" and other specific problems, we must adopt a positive attitude and mobilize the masses to find solutions. The reason why the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system is well implemented in the Jicun Management District is not because it has not encountered difficult problems, but because it has tried to solve the specific difficulties one by one without fear of trouble after encountering difficult problems. As a result, the difficulties were overcome, the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" was adhered to, the enthusiasm of the commune members and production teams was improved, and the autumn harvest work was done better.

    “三包一奖”必须坚持
    ——山西日报社论摘要
    当前，贯彻执行“三包一奖”制度的核心问题是兑现问题。冀村管理区的经验特别值得重视的地方，就在于他们抓住火候，选择了在秋收开始（而不是在秋收以后，更不是来年春季），系统总结了夏季执行“三包一奖”制度的经验，同时公布了秋作物“三包一奖”兑现方案。这样，解除了人们对“三包一奖”制是否执行的疑虑，使“三包一奖”制变成一个富有生命力的活制度，大大地推动了生产，调动了社员的积极性，使生产队干部和社员都为超包产而积极努力。
    抓住了火候，就是我们通常所说的掌握了工作中的规律性。冀村管理区由于他们摸住了“三包一奖”春订秋落实（小麦是秋订夏落实）这个规律，便抓住了目前保证“三包一奖”制度兑现的最好时机，因而促进了细收细打争超产的群众运动，做到了收割拉运不丢穗，打场入仓不丢颗。过去，不少地区往往是在秋收以后，结合订来年包产计划，来总结“三包一奖”制度的经验，这对第二年的生产自然也有好处，但对当年生产结合不紧，促进当年生产作用不大。而冀村管理区在秋收当中公布“三包一奖”兑现试算方案，就补救了这一缺陷。因此，希望各地都像汾阳、文水一样，结合本区、本社“三包一奖”制度执行的情况和问题，普遍进行“三包一奖”兑现试算工作，并向全体社员公布。与此同时，制订明年的“三包一奖”方案。这样，今年“三包一奖”能兑现，社员就像吃了“定心丸”就会再接再厉，千方百计争取秋收更多超产；而明年“三包一奖”方案的制订，也就会更加鼓舞社员的信心，为明年更多超包产积极地完成秋种计划。
    贯彻执行“三包一奖”制度和贯彻执行其它制度一样，通常有三种情况：一种是活执行，一种是死执行，一种是不执行。冀村管理区的经验所以大有可取之处，就在于他们是活执行了“三包一奖”制。我们知道，搞农业生产是和“老天爷”打交道。天有不测风雨，在我们现有物质技术条件下，有些“风雨”我们已经可以预测到，但预测不到的“风雨”也还不少，因而在生产过程中，免不了会出现“实产”和“包产”不对头的情况。活执行“三包一奖”制，就是要遇到“产”不符“包”和其它具体问题的时候，要采取积极态度，发动群众想办法解决它。冀村管理区“三包一奖”制度执行得好，不是由于它没有发生困难问题，而是因为它在遇到困难问题后，不怕麻烦地设法解决遇到的一个一个的具体困难，结果，困难克服了，“三包一奖”坚持下去了，社员和生产队的积极性提高了，秋收工作搞得更好了。
