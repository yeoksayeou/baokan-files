　　Hefei, October 12th (By our newspaper) The Peidong Brigade of the Peidong Commune in Lu'an County, Anhui Province, has achieved large-scale, high-yield wheat harvests for consecutive years. Starting this autumn sowing season, the Lu'an Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Anhui Province, will universally promote the wheat planting experience of this brigade, striving to have the entire prefecture catch up with Peidong's wheat production level. This is a strategic measure to implement the policy of the entire party and all people engaging in agriculture and grain production on a large scale, ensuring even greater grain production next summer. Currently, throughout the prefecture, a vigorous and down-to-earth mass movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass Peidong, based on good wheat planting, is unfolding in full swing.

　　The basic experience of the Peidong Brigade in achieving continuous large-scale, high-yield wheat harvests is that, in accordance with the Party's instructions, cadres conduct experiments every year and launch mass movements for large-scale, high-yield wheat production. They have successively created a complete set of experiences centered on rational close planting, ensuring that large areas of wheat are planted and managed well. Especially in terms of sowing, they have created a "sparse inside, dense outside" wide-swath strip planting method, which solves the problem of wheat ventilation and light transmission, and can effectively prevent wheat lodging. They put in hard work and meticulous effort in every aspect of sowing. The land is generally deeply plowed to a depth of six to eight inches, and some even reach one foot or more. In terms of land preparation, they prepare the land according to the stubble, meticulously tilling and creating ridges, ensuring fine plowing and leveling, with loose soil on top and firm soil below. At the same time, according to different conditions such as soil structure and drainage, they appropriately handle the width and depth of the ridges and ditches, so as to both improve land utilization and facilitate ditch clearing and drainage. In terms of fertilization methods, they have successively created the experience of "three fertilizations at sowing" (spreading base fertilizer, applying ditch fertilizer, and covering seed fertilizer), which is a rational fertilization and economical fertilizer use, truly applying the fertilizer to the "cutting edge" and maximizing the fertilizer's role in increasing grain production.

　　The Lu'an Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to Peidong's wheat planting experience. Du Weiyou, the first secretary of the Prefectural Committee, and other responsible comrades frequently go deep into the Peidong fields to meticulously study and summarize experiences together with the commune members, and promptly promote them. Practice over the years has proven that many places have achieved substantial increases in wheat production by learning from Peidong. Therefore, the Lu'an Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regards the promotion of Peidong's high-yield wheat experience as a key measure to increase grain production, and grasps it firmly and meticulously.

　　In the process of learning from and promoting Peidong's experience, various localities have conducted extensive and in-depth publicity and mobilization. With the spirit of engaging in agriculture and grain production on a large scale, they have repeatedly explained the great significance of seriously promoting Peidong's wheat planting experience, and conducted seminars and discussions. The understanding of the broad masses of cadres and the people has been universally raised, their thinking unified, and their enthusiasm is soaring. Zhouji Commune in Huoqiu County, which accounts for one-fifth of the county's wheat planting area and has been learning from Peidong's experience for three or four consecutive years, has summarized its past experience in learning from Peidong. This year, the 280,000 mu of wheat sown will comprehensively learn from Peidong's experience. Among them, the continuous, large-scale, high-yield fields have been expanded from 20,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu this year, striving to surpass Peidong's level.

　　The Zhakou Production Team of Zhouji Commune in Huoqiu County, in accordance with Peidong's experience of three fertilizations at sowing, originally planned to apply 150 dan of base fertilizer, 500 jin of ditch fertilizer (human and animal manure), and 15 dan of seed covering fertilizer per mu. By mid-August, they had overfulfilled the task of accumulating fertilizer, reaching 230 dan per mu, and 80% of the fertilizer had been transported to the fields. In Sujiabu Commune, Lu'an County, the commune's industrial minister led five technicians to Peidong one and a half months ago to learn about and rush-produce new-style strip seeding machines. After returning, the entire commune organized more than 370 iron and wood technicians to rush-produce sowing tools, and has newly produced and modified more than 1,420 pieces of various new-style tools. The commune has also established more than 700 technical research groups, responsible for imparting and researching Peidong's sowing and management techniques.

    赶上先进水平、超过先进水平
    六安地委推广渒东种麦经验 
    主要经验是：采用“里稀外稠”宽幅条播，麦田耕得深整得细和“三肥下种”
    本报合肥12日电　安徽六安县渒东公社渒东大队，连年获得了小麦大面积高额丰产。中共安徽省六安地委从秋种开始，就把普遍推广这个大队的小麦播种经验，力争全专区赶上渒东的小麦生产水平，作为贯彻全党全民大办农业、大办粮食，确保明年夏季增产更多粮食的一个战略措施。当前，全专区一个轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实的以种好小麦为基础的学渒东、赶渒东、超渒东的群众运动，正在全面展开。
    渒东大队连续获得小麦大面积高额丰产的基本经验是，按照党的指示，干部年年搞试验，大搞小麦大面积高额丰产的群众运动，先后创造了以合理密植为中心的一整套经验，保证了大面积的小麦种得好，管得好。特别是在播种方面，他们创造了一种“里稀外稠”的宽幅条播法，解决了小麦的通风透光问题，能够有效地防止小麦倒伏。他们在播种的每一个环节上都狠下苦功，认真细作，土地一般都深耕六至八寸，有的达一尺以上。在整地方面，是看茬整地，细整作畦，做到耙细整平，土壤上松下实。同时根据土壤结构和排水条件等不同情况，适当处理畦与沟的宽度与深度，做到既提高土地利用率，又有利于清沟排水。在施肥方法上，先后创造了“三肥下种”（铺底肥、垫沟肥、盖种肥）的合理施肥、经济用肥的经验，把肥料真正用在“刀刃”上，发挥了肥料对粮食增产的最大作用。
    中共六安地委对渒东的小麦播种经验极为重视。地委第一书记杜维佑等负责同志，经常深入到渒东田间，和社员一道细致地研究、总结经验并及时推广。几年来的实践证明，许多地方因为学习渒东而获得了小麦大幅度增产。因此，中共六安地委把推广渒东小麦丰产经验，当作增产粮食的一个关键性措施，狠抓细抓。
    在学习和推广渒东的经验中，各地都进行了广泛深入的宣传动员，以大办农业、大办粮食的精神，反复说明了认真推广渒东种麦经验的重大意义，并进行了座谈讨论。广大干部和群众的认识普遍提高，思想统一，干劲冲天。占全县小麦播种面积五分之一，已连续三、四年学习渒东经验的霍丘县周集公社，在总结已往学习渒东经验的基础上，今年播种的二十八万亩小麦，要求全面学习渒东经验，其中连片的大面积高额丰产田，由去年的二万亩扩大到今年的三万亩，力争超过渒东的水平。
    霍丘县周集公社闸口生产队，按照渒东三肥下种的经验，原来准备每亩地施铺底肥一百五十担，垫沟肥（人、畜粪）五百斤，盖种肥十五担，在8月中旬就超额完成了积肥任务，每亩达到二百三十担，并有80％的肥料运到了田头。六安县苏家埠公社，在一个半月前，便由公社工业部长率领五名技术工人前往渒东学习和赶制新式条播器，回去后，全社组织了三百七十多名铁木技术工人赶制播种工具，已新制和改制各种新式工具一千四百二十多件。这个公社还成立了七百多个技术研究小组，负责传授和研究渒东播种和管理方面的技术。
