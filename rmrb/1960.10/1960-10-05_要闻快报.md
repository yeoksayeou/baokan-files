Various areas are strengthening the cleaning and drying of seeds on the one hand, and mutually adjusting them based on the principle of equivalent exchange on the other. Areas with earlier seasons have already begun sowing winter crops.

	Hubei Has Plowed Seventeen Million Mu of Land
	Hubei is preparing good soil for autumn sowing, and has plowed 17 million mu of autumn fields, of which 9.72 million mu have been deep-plowed.
	In the deep-plowing and land preparation movement, various areas have taken bringing newly reclaimed wasteland up to the level of cultivated land as an important link. Some areas have adopted methods such as early leveling, reforming ditches and ridges, and applying more base fertilizer to newly reclaimed wasteland, so that the quality is equivalent to cultivated land.

	Liaoning's Autumn Harvest Progress Exceeds Previous Years

As of recently, the province's main economic crop—flue-cured tobacco—has been picked and processed to yield more than 200,000 dan, and the harvesting of tea, hemp, cotton, oil tea seeds, and raw lacquer has also entered a busy season.

	Guangdong Hastens Preparation of Farm Tools for Autumn Harvest and Winter Planting

After years of large-scale land reclamation and expansion, the area of mature oil tea forests in Fujian Province that are flowering and bearing fruit this year has increased by more than double compared to last year.
