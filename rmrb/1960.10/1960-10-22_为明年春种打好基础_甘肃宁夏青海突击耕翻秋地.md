Xinhua News Agency Report:

    To lay a solid foundation for next year's spring planting, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai are intensifying autumn land preparation.
    While engaging in intensive autumn planting and harvesting, Party committees at all levels in Gansu Province are vigorously promoting autumn cultivation, determined to till the harvested fields well this winter to lay a solid foundation for next year's spring planting. As of now, the province has plowed 10.17 million mu of harvested fields once or twice. The Dingxi Special District and the Hexi Corridor are the main areas for autumn cultivation, and this year's autumn cultivation work is progressing particularly rapidly. The Dingxi Special District has already plowed 4.66 million mu, and the Hexi Corridor has plowed 2.49 million mu.
    In order to accelerate and ensure the quality of autumn plowing of harvested fields, Party committees at all levels have strengthened leadership at each level, assigned a leading cadre to be specifically responsible, and sent a large number of cadres deep into production teams and production brigades to strengthen specific leadership, educate the vast numbers of cadres and masses to further recognize the benefits of autumn plowing for eliminating stubble, summarize experience, propose methods, and actively invest in autumn cultivation.
    While arranging labor and animal power well, various localities have universally established temporary plowing professional teams based on production brigades, and promoted a small-section contract responsibility system.
    Xinhua News Agency Report: People's communes in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are vigorously carrying out an autumn cultivation campaign. As of the 12th, the region had plowed over 4.78 million mu of land, of which over 2.27 million mu of summer harvested fields had been plowed twice, some three to four times, and over 700,000 mu of autumn harvested fields had also been plowed.
    This year, the autumn planting area in Ningxia is relatively large, and all winter wheat and rapeseed fields must be plowed and sown in a timely manner. In addition, the larger area of autumn harvested fields must also be plowed in a timely manner. In order to complete the autumn cultivation task in a timely manner, various people's communes, while concentrating on threshing and seizing soil moisture for autumn planting, organized more than 56,000 laborers, more than 40,000 pairs of draft animals, and some tractors to take advantage of the rain and seize soil moisture for autumn cultivation. All communes have made specific arrangements for autumn cultivation work based on production needs and the situation of manpower, animal power, farm implements, and soil quality.
    Xinhua News Agency Report: All parts of Qinghai Province are seizing the current season of clear autumn weather to intensively plow autumn land. At present, the area of autumn harvested fields that has been plowed accounts for about half of the harvested area, and fields planted with late-maturing crops are also being plowed while being harvested. Many irrigated areas that were harvested earlier have already been plowed a second time.
    Since autumn plowing has a great effect on increasing agricultural production next year and is also an agricultural activity with a strong sense of timing, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee issued an "Instruction on Immediately Launching an Autumn and Winter Production Movement Centered on Autumn Plowing" in early October after the main grain crops in various localities had been basically harvested. It required the province to plow all types of cultivated land once in the month and a half from October to mid-November, and some irrigated land twice or three times. The Provincial Party Committee's call quickly turned into mass action. Leading cadres of various communes and brigades have gone deep into production teams to lead autumn plowing.
    In order to improve the attendance rate of tractors, the mechanical autumn plowing teams of various state-owned farms and agency farms have implemented a responsibility system of setting tasks, setting time, setting quality, and setting operation areas, and on this basis, launched a red flag competition to catch up with each other.

    为明年春种打好基础
    甘肃宁夏青海突击耕翻秋地
    据新华社讯　在紧张的秋种、秋收同时，甘肃省各级党委狠抓秋耕工作，决心把秋茬地在今冬耕好，为明年春种打好基础。截至目前，全省已经将一千零十七万亩秋茬地耕犁了一遍到两遍。定西专区和河西走廊是秋耕地的主要地区，今年秋耕工作进展特别迅速，定西专区已经犁地四百六十六万亩，河西走廊已经犁地二百四十九万亩。
    为了加快茬地秋翻、保质保量，各级党委层层加强领导，指定一名领导干部专门负责，派出大批干部深入生产队和生产小队，加强具体领导，教育广大干部和群众进一步认识秋翻地灭茬的好处，总结经验，提出办法，积极投入秋耕。
    各地在安排好劳、畜力的情况下，以生产小队为单位，普遍建立临时犁地专业队，推行小段包工责任制。
    据新华社讯　宁夏回族自治区各地人民公社正在大力开展秋耕运动。到12日止，全区已耕翻土地四百七十八万多亩，其中有二百二十七万多亩夏茬地耕翻了二遍，有的翻了三遍到四遍，秋茬地也已耕翻了七十多万亩。
    今年宁夏地区的秋播面积较大，所有的冬麦和油菜田都要及时犁翻下种；另外，面积较大的秋茬地也要赶时间翻完。为了适时完成秋耕任务，各地人民公社在突击打场、抢墒秋种的同时，组织了五万六千多劳力、四万多对耕畜和一部分拖拉机，趁雨抢墒秋耕。各公社都根据生产需要和人力、畜力、农具、土质的情况，对秋耕工作做了具体安排。
    据新华社讯　青海省各地抓紧当前秋高气爽的时节，突击耕翻秋地。目前，全省翻过秋茬的田地已占收割面积一半左右，种植晚熟作物的田也正在一边收割一边翻茬，许多收割较早的川水地区已经在翻第二遍。
    由于耕翻秋地对明年农业增产有很大作用，同时又是时间性很强的农活，因此中共青海省委在10月初各地主粮作物基本收完以后，就发出了“立即开展以秋翻为中心的秋冬季生产运动的指示”，要求全省在10月到11月中旬的一个半月中，把各类耕地都翻一遍，部分水地翻两遍或三遍。省委的号召，迅速变为群众的行动。各公社、大队的领导干部都深入到生产队领导翻耕秋地。
    各国营农牧场和机关农场的机械秋耕队为了提高拖拉机的出勤率，都推行了定任务、定时间、定质量、定作业区的责任制，在此基础上展开了你追我赶的红旗竞赛。
