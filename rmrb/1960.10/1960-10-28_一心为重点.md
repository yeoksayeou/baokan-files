Editor's Note:

    Focusing on the Key Task
    Coal is a key component of railway transportation. Whether or not coal transportation tasks can be completed on time and in sufficient quantities is one of the important conditions for ensuring a substantial increase in steel production. Therefore, the railway department must first ensure that coal is transported well.
    Coal is often transported from its place of origin to where it is needed through railways under the jurisdiction of several railway bureaus. In this way, it is difficult to do a good job by relying solely on the efforts of the railway bureau in the coal-producing area. For example, if the receiving bureau does not promptly return empty cars after receiving the coal, it will be difficult for the producing area to continue shipping coal out. Therefore, to transport more coal and transport it in a timely manner, the relevant railway bureaus must cooperate and create conditions for each other.
    Whether cooperation is good depends on whether there is a "focusing on the key task" mentality. With this mentality, one will act like the Beijing Railway Bureau, putting "others before oneself, external needs before internal needs." When there are few empty cars, they will reduce the amount of non-key materials they transport. When arranging empty cars to be sent out, they would rather extend their own working hours to provide convenience to others. This style of communist large-scale collaboration is worthy of great promotion.
    May the idea of "focusing on the key task" take root in the work of every department, every unit, and in the minds of everyone.

    一心为重点
    煤是铁路运输的重点。能否按时按量完成煤炭运输任务，是保证钢铁产量大幅度增长的重要条件之一。所以，铁道部门首先要保证把煤运好。
    煤炭从产地运到需要的地方，往往要经过几个铁路局所管的铁路。这样，仅靠煤炭产地的铁路局一方努力，就很难搞好。例如，对方局收到了煤，但是没有及时把空车送回来，产地要继续往外运煤就困难了。因此，煤要运得多，运得及时，就必须各个有关的铁路局配合作战，互相创造条件。
    能不能配合好，关键在于有没有“一心为重点”的思想，有了这种思想，就会像北京铁路局那样，“先人后己，先外后内”，当空车少时，就压缩自己非重点物资的运输量，在给排去的空车编组时，宁肯延长自己的作业时间，而给别人方便。这种共产主义大协作的风格，值得大大提倡。
    愿“一心为重点”的思想在每个部门、每个单位的工作中、在每个人的思想里扎下根。
