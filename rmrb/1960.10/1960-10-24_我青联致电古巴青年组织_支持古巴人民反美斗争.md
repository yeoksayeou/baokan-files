Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd. The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today sent telegrams to the Cuban Socialist Youth League, the Cuban "July 26th" Movement, the Cuban Revolutionary Guidance Committee, the Cuban Rebel Army Youth Association, and the Cuban University Students Federation, supporting the just struggle of Cuban youth against U.S. imperialist economic blockade and military threats.

The telegram stated: "We Chinese youth, with boundless anger, strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' announcement of a complete 'embargo' against Cuba and their stepped-up troop increases in Guantanamo, attempting to strangle the Cuban revolution through economic blockade and military threats. We will forever stand on the side of the Cuban people and youth, and fully support your just struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and in defense of national independence. The Cuban people and youth, who dare to despise imperialism, dare to advance revolutionary struggle, and resolutely defend the fruits of revolutionary victory, cannot be subdued by any force. No matter how ferocious and evil U.S. imperialism becomes, and no matter what despicable and barbaric means of aggression it adopts against Cuba, it cannot save itself from its destiny of failure and demise. We firmly believe that as long as the heroic Cuban people and youth continue to strengthen unity and persist in a tit-for-tat struggle against U.S. imperialism, they will surely be able to smash the enemy's aggressive conspiracies and achieve final victory."

    我青联致电古巴青年组织
    支持古巴人民反美斗争
    新华社23日讯　中华全国青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会今天致电古巴社会主义青年联盟、古巴“7月26日”运动、古巴革命指导委员会、古巴起义军青年协会和古巴大学生联合会，支持古巴青年反对美帝国主义经济封锁和武力威胁的正义斗争。
    电报说：“我们中国青年以无比愤怒的心情，强烈谴责美帝国主义宣布对古巴实行全面‘禁运’以及加紧在关塔那摩增兵，妄图用经济封锁和武力威胁扼杀古巴革命的侵略阴谋。我们将永远站在古巴人民和青年这一边，全力支持你们反对美帝国主义侵略和维护民族独立的正义斗争。“敢于藐视帝国主义、敢于推进革命斗争和坚决保卫革命胜利果实的古巴人民和青年，是任何力量也压服不了的。美帝国主义不管怎样穷凶极恶，对古巴采取各种卑鄙野蛮的侵略手段，但都无法挽救它走向失败和灭亡的命运。我们坚信，英雄的古巴人民和青年只要继续加强团结，坚持同美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争，就一定能够粉碎敌人的侵略阴谋，取得最后的胜利。”
