Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 5th October: Burmese Federal Premier Wu Nu and some members of the Burmese government delegation he led, left Kunming by special plane this morning to return home, fully laden with the profound "Pauk-Phaw" (brotherly) friendship of the Chinese people towards the Burmese people.

Yan Hongyan, First Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Yu Yichuan, Governor of Yunnan Province, Vice Governors Liu Minghui, Zhang Chong, and Guo Chao, Commander Chen Kang, Lieutenant General, and Lu Ruilin, Major General, leaders of the PLA units stationed in Kunming, Zhao Zengyi, First Secretary of the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Pan Shuoduan, Mayor of Kunming, and more than 3,000 people of all ethnic groups in Kunming went to the airport to see off the distinguished guests.

Also at the airport to see off the distinguished guests were Geng Biao, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Li Yimang, China's Ambassador to the Union of Burma, and Yu Peiwen, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who had specially accompanied Premier Wu Nu from Beijing to Kunming.

Governor Yu Yichuan said at the airport when bidding farewell to Premier Wu Nu: Our respected state guest and dear friend, Premier Wu Nu and Madame, and other distinguished Burmese guests, after celebrating our National Day together with the people of our country, and signing the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty with our Premier Zhou Enlai during this festival, are today returning to your motherland with the "Pauk-Phaw" friendship of the Chinese people for the Burmese people. We warmly cheer for the further development of Sino-Burmese friendly relations, and we are also reluctant to part with you. Governor Yu Yichuan said that Yunnan Province and the Union of Burma are connected by mountains and rivers and have very close relations. Not only is the friendly exchange in the border areas developing day by day, but also Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, has the honor of becoming a passage for friendly exchanges between the leaders and peoples of the two countries. Every visit by Your Excellency the Premier and Madame, and distinguished Burmese guests, adds a glorious brilliance of friendship to this city, which is like spring all year round. We sincerely hope that you will come here often to visit relatives and friends. My colleagues and I, and the people of all ethnic groups in Kunming, regard it as our pleasant task to have more opportunities to receive distinguished Burmese guests and promote mutual understanding and traditional friendship between China and Burma. Finally, Governor Yu Yichuan wished Premier Wu Nu and Madame and other distinguished Burmese guests a safe journey home.

In his farewell speech, Premier Wu Nu said: When we came to Kunming, I received a warm and friendly reception from the leaders of Yunnan Province and people from all walks of life. When we went to Beijing and any other place, we were also given a very warm and sincere reception and care by the leaders of the Chinese government and the people of the Chinese nation, just like our own brothers and sisters, which deeply moved us. Therefore, now that I am about to leave Kunming and return home, I believe that the warm and friendly reception you have given us will forever remain in our hearts.

Premier Wu Nu said that in 1954, the Chinese leader, Premier Zhou Enlai, and I jointly established the friendly relations between the two countries. From that time until now, it has been six years. During these six years, we have achieved many successes in the friendship between the two countries, so that on October 1st this year, we signed the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. The signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty has brilliantly established the Sino-Burmese Friendship Mansion that our two countries eagerly hope for. Of course, after the Sino-Burmese Friendship Mansion is built, I think it can be said that this mansion is like a very precious jewel. If a jewel is not well protected and regularly taken care of, it will also be contaminated with dust and lose its brilliance; similarly, the Sino-Burmese Friendship Mansion must also be regularly protected and guarded. Therefore, I think that although the Sino-Burmese Friendship Mansion has been built, we cannot think that we can relax. On the contrary, we should better maintain it so that it will not be contaminated with dust and lose its brilliance. Therefore, I would like to ask all the people of China and Burma to do everything in their power and wisdom to jointly maintain this glorious Sino-Burmese Friendship Mansion. In particular, I would like to point out that the young Chinese brothers and sisters here have a major responsibility in maintaining the Sino-Burmese Friendship Mansion.

Premier Wu Nu finally expressed that he would often come to Yunnan Province to visit, and also sincerely invited the leaders of Yunnan Province and people from all walks of life in Yunnan Province to have the opportunity to visit Burma. Premier Wu Nu also expressed his heartfelt thanks to the leaders of Yunnan Province and other people from all walks of life for the sincere, warm, and fraternal welcome and reception he and the members of the Burmese government delegation received during their stay in Kunming.

This morning, the national flags of China and Burma and large red banners written in both Chinese and Burmese were hung at Kunming Airport: "Farewell to Premier Wu Nu of the Union of Burma and the Burmese Government Delegation." At 7:30, when Premier Wu Nu and other distinguished guests arrived at the airport by car, the more than 3,000 people waiting at the airport to see them off applauded and cheered warmly. The band played the solemn national anthems of the Union of Burma and the People's Republic of China. Premier Wu Nu, accompanied by Yan Hongyan, First Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Governor Yu Yichuan, reviewed the army honor guard. Finally, Premier Wu Nu shook hands with the people who came to see him off one by one to say goodbye. Among them were the heads of various departments of the Provincial People's Committee, Liu Linyuan, Wang Shaoyan, and Hu Baotang, Standing Committee members of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, heads of local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations, Dao Jingban, Governor of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Vice Governors Lei Chunguo, Gong Shou, Si Lasha, Si Hongsheng, and Pai Qiren, Hu Zhonghua, Deputy Commissioner of the Lincang Special District, Pei Abe, Governor of the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Cha Guangzhou, Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Prefecture's CPPCC Committee, and Duan Chengjing, Deputy County Head of Lushui County, etc.

Premier Wu Nu, accompanied by Yan Hongyan, Yu Yichuan and others, walked towards the crowd who came to see him off. People waved the national flags of China and Burma, flowers and scarves to say goodbye to Premier Wu Nu. The sounds of gongs and drums, suonas, elephant-foot drums and cheers were intertwined, and many young people ran out of the crowd to offer flowers to Premier Wu Nu and Madame. Premier Wu Nu also constantly waved to the departing crowd. When the special plane took off, the people who came to see him off waved and cheered to the gradually receding special plane for a long time: "Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!" Today, Su Pi, Chairman of the Shan State Council of the Union of Burma, Wu Shan Niu, Chairman of the Kachin State Council of the Union of Burma, and the Shan State and Kachin State friendship delegation of the Union of Burma, who are also visiting Kunming, went to the airport to see off Premier Wu Nu. Also going to the airport to see him off were Wu Mao Mao Suo, Consul General of the Union of Burma in Kunming, and Wu Xin, Vice Consul of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Kunming.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Premier Zhou Enlai received a telegram from Premier Wu Nu of the Union of Burma when he flew over the border between China and Burma on his way back home. In the telegram, Premier Wu Nu expressed his gratitude for the reception he and the Burmese government delegation received during their visit to China.

Premier Wu Nu's telegram is as follows:

“Now, as I fly across the peaceful border between our two countries on my way back from your friendly capital, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for the courtesy, sincere and warm friendship and solicitous reception given to me and my delegation during our visit. We will do our best to reciprocate all of this when we hope to see you visit Yangon next January. My wife and I join me in extending our warm greetings and best wishes to you and your wife.” (Attached photo)

    吴努总理离昆明回国
    云南党政负责人和各族群众三千多人到机场欢送
    吴努总理致电周总理感谢在访问期间给予的热情接待
    新华社昆明5日电　缅甸联邦总理吴努和他率领的缅甸政府代表团部分团员，今天上午满载着中国人民对缅甸人民“胞波”一样的深厚情谊，乘专机离开昆明回国。
    中共云南省委第一书记阎红彦，云南省省长于一川，副省长刘明辉、张冲、郭超，驻昆明部队首长陈康中将、鲁瑞林少将，中共昆明市委第一书记赵增益，昆明市市长潘朔端，以及昆明市各族群众三千多人到机场欢送贵宾。
    到机场欢送贵宾的，还有从北京专程陪送吴努总理来到昆明的外交部副部长耿飚、我国驻缅甸联邦大使李一氓和外交部礼宾司司长俞沛文。
    于一川省长在机场上送别吴努总理时讲话说：我们尊敬的国宾和亲爱的朋友——吴努总理和夫人，以及其他缅甸贵宾们，在同我国人民一起欢度我国国庆节，并在这个节日里同我国周恩来总理签订了中缅边界条约之后，今天带着中国人民对于缅甸人民的“胞波”情谊返回祖国。我们既为中缅友好关系的进一步发展而热烈欢呼，又为即将分手而依依惜别。于一川省长说，云南省和缅甸联邦山水相连，关系十分密切，不仅边境地区的友好往来日益发展，而且云南省省会——昆明也荣幸地成为两国领导人和两国人民友好往来的通道。总理阁下和夫人以及缅甸贵宾们的每一次光临，都给这个四季如春的城市增添了友谊的光彩。我们衷心地期望你们经常来这里探亲访友，我和我的同事们以及昆明市各族人民都以能够有更多的机会接待缅甸贵宾们，促进中缅两国的相互了解和传统友谊，作为自己愉快的任务。最后，于一川省长祝吴努总理和夫人以及缅甸其他贵宾们在返国途中一路平安。
    吴努总理在告别讲话中说：当我们来到昆明的时候，我受到云南省的领导人和各界人民的热情友好的接待。当我们到北京和任何其他的地方，也同样受到中国政府领导人和中国国家的人民，就像我们的亲兄弟姐妹一样给予我们非常热情、非常诚恳的接待和照顾，使我们深为感动。因此，现在我快要离开昆明回国的时候，我相信你们给予我们的热情友好的接待将永远留在我们的心中。
    吴努总理说，1954年，中国的领导人——周恩来总理和我一起建立了两国的友好关系，从那时候开始到现在，已经六年了。在这六年期间，我们在两国的友好方面，获得了很多的成功，以致在今年10月1日我们就签订了中缅边界条约。中缅边界条约的签订，使我们两国所热切希望的中缅友好大厦光辉地建立起来了。当然，在中缅友好大厦建立之后，我想可以这样讲，这个大厦就像一颗很珍贵的宝石，一颗宝石如果不很好地加以保护，不经常地加以保管，它也会沾染上灰尘而丧失它的光辉；同样的，中缅友好大厦，也必须经常地加以保护和看管。因此我想，中缅友好大厦虽然已经建成了，但是我们不能认为，我们就可以松懈下来了，相反，我们就应该更好地维护它，不致使它沾染上灰尘，不致使它消失它的光辉。因此我愿意要求中国和缅甸所有人民，一起尽一切力量和智慧，共同来维护这座光辉的中缅友好大厦。特别我愿意指出，在这里的中国方面的年轻的兄弟姊妹们，在维护中缅友好大厦方面是有着重大责任的。
    吴努总理最后表示他时常要来云南省访问，同时也诚恳地邀请云南省的领导人和云南省各界人民，有机会也能到缅甸去进行访问。吴努总理还对他以及缅甸政府代表团团员们这次在昆明期间所受到的云南省领导人及其他各界人民的诚恳、热烈、像亲兄弟姐妹一般的欢迎和接待，表示衷心的感谢。
    今天上午，昆明机场上悬挂着中缅两国国旗和用中缅两国文字所写的大红标语：“欢送缅甸联邦总理吴努和缅甸政府代表团。”七时半，当吴努总理和其他贵宾们乘车来到机场的时候，等候在机场上欢送的三千多群众都热烈鼓掌欢呼。乐队奏起了庄严的缅甸联邦和中华人民共和国国歌。吴努总理在中共云南省委第一书记阎红彦和于一川省长的陪同下检阅了陆军仪仗队。最后，吴努总理和前来欢送的人们一一握手告别。他们当中，有省人民委员会各部门负责人，政协云南省委员会副主席刘林元、王少岩、常务委员胡宝堂，各民主党派、人民团体地方组织负责人，德宏傣族景颇族自治州州长刀京版，副州长雷春国、龚绶、司拉山、思鸿升、排启仁，临沧专区副专员胡忠华，怒江傈僳族自治州州长裴阿贝，自治州政协委员会副主席茶光周，泸水县副县长段承经等。
    吴努总理由阎红彦、于一川等人陪同走向欢送的群众。人们挥舞着中缅两国国旗，鲜花和纱巾向吴努总理告别。锣鼓声、唢呐声、象脚鼓声和欢呼声交织在一起，许多青年从队伍中跑出来向吴努总理和夫人献花。吴努总理也不断向送行的群众挥手告别。当专机起飞的时候，欢送的人们还向逐渐远去的专机长时间地挥手欢呼：“中缅友好万岁！”今天，正在昆明访问的缅甸联邦掸邦议会主席苏辟、克钦邦议会主席吴山纽以及缅甸联邦掸邦和克钦邦友好代表团也到机场为吴努总理送行。前往机场送行的，还有缅甸联邦驻昆明总领事吴茂茂梭，越南民主共和国驻昆明副领事吴新。
    新华社5日讯　周恩来总理收到了缅甸联邦吴努总理回国途中飞越中缅两国边界时发来的一份电报。吴努总理在电报中对他和缅甸联邦政府代表团在访问中国期间所受到的接待表示感谢。
    吴努总理的电报如下：
      “现在当我由贵国友好首都返国途中飞越两国和平边界时，我愿意衷心的感谢您在我们访问期间给予我和我的代表团的礼遇和诚恳热情的友谊以及殷勤的接待。对这一切我们将尽力在我们所盼望您明年1月访问仰光时给予回报。我的夫人和我一起向您和您的夫人表示亲切的问候和最好的祝愿。”（附图片）
