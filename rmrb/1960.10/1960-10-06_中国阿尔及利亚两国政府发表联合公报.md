At the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Premier Abbas Ferhat of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria led a delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria to visit China from September 29 to October 6, 1960, and participated in the celebrations of the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

During the visit, Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the People's Republic of China met with Premier Abbas Ferhat and other members of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria for a long time.

Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China and Premier Abbas Ferhat of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria held cordial and sincere talks. The Chinese side participating in the talks included Vice Premier He Long, Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Yi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Zhang Aiping, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Li Qiang, and Director of the West Asian and African Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs He Ying. The Algerian side participating in the talks included Minister of Interior Ben Tobbal Akhdar, Director of the Prime Minister's Office Ben Yahia Mohammed, Director of Political Affairs of the Propaganda Department Boumendjel Ahmed, and Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Interior Hane Lamine.

The talks involved the following issues: the situation of the struggle in Algeria and the further development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Algeria, the situation in the Asian and African region, and the current international situation. Both sides were satisfied with reaching unanimous opinions.

Both sides believe that all obstacles and threats to world peace are caused by the following reasons: the continued implementation of policies of aggression and war by imperialism, the continuous intensification of interference in the national independence movements of colonies and semi-colonies by imperialism, and the strengthening of bloody suppression and continued wars of aggression, as is being carried out in Algeria.

Therefore, both sides believe that the resolute struggle against the imperialist policies of aggression and war, and for freedom and peace, is the urgent and primary political task of the people of all countries in the world. This task requires them to unite. Both sides recognize that the national liberation movements in colonies and semi-colonies and the actions of people in all countries in the world to strive for democracy and social progress have made significant contributions to the above-mentioned struggle.

Both sides are pleased to see that the movement of people in all countries of the world against imperialism is developing more deeply and widely. Both sides firmly believe that as long as the people persist in their struggle and form a broad united front against imperialism, they will surely be able to defeat imperialism and colonialism, gain and safeguard national independence, and defend world peace.

Both sides are satisfied to see that the national liberation movement in the world is developing vigorously. In particular, the struggle of the people of the African continent to strive for and safeguard national independence and against imperialism and colonialism has formed an irresistible torrent. Both sides warmly congratulate many African countries on winning independence, warmly congratulate the friendship and solidarity of the people of Asia, Africa, and other countries in their common struggle are strengthening day by day, and wish the people of all countries still under colonial rule an early victory in their struggle for national independence. Both sides solemnly declare: resolutely support the just struggle of the people of Congo, the people of Cuba, and the people of colonies and semi-colonies and other countries to strive for and safeguard national independence. Both sides severely condemn the governments of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, mainly the United States government, for supporting the French government's colonial suppression and continued war of aggression against Algeria. Both sides appeal to the people of all countries in the world, especially the governments and people of Asian and African countries, hoping that they will take effective measures to resolutely support the just struggle of the people of these countries to safeguard and strive for national independence, and resolutely stop the crimes of interference and aggression.

In the talks, the Chinese side praised the heroic struggle of the Algerian people under the leadership of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria and the National Liberation Front for national independence, and severely opposed and condemned the French imperialist colonial war and acts of aggression against Algeria with the support of US imperialism. The Chinese government reiterates its unwavering and firm position of helping and supporting the just struggle of the Algerian people. The Chinese government supports the Algerian people who insist on and strengthen the armed struggle in the fight for national independence, and does not exclude negotiations on an equal basis, which helps to expose the other side's deception. The Chinese government firmly believes that the heroic Algerian people will defeat all aggressors, completely and thoroughly liberate their homeland, and achieve the final victory in the national liberation struggle with the support of the people of all countries in the world.

The Algerian side expressed admiration for the Chinese government and people's consistent efforts and contributions to safeguarding world peace, achieving universal disarmament, banning nuclear weapons, advocating and implementing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and strengthening the unity and cooperation of Asian and African countries, as well as for the firm and unwavering just stance taken in opposing the imperialist policies of war and aggression, supporting the struggle of the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries for national independence, and supporting the struggle of the people of all countries for peace, democracy, and social progress; and fully supports the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate their territory of Taiwan.

Both sides are pleased to point out that the friendly and cooperative relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Algeria based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are constantly strengthening. Both sides further studied various ways to enhance friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. The Government of the People's Republic of China welcomes the early establishment of a representative office of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria in the capital of the People's Republic of China. Both sides unanimously believe that the deep friendship between China and Algeria and the people of the two countries, which has grown up in the common struggle against imperialism, will be further consolidated and developed.

    会谈涉及以下问题：阿尔及利亚的斗争形势和进一步发展中阿两国友好合作关系，亚非地区形势和当前国际形势。双方满意地取得了一致的意见。
    双方认为，世界和平的一切障碍和威胁都是由于下列原因所引起的，这就是：帝国主义继续执行侵略政策和战争政策，帝国主义不断加紧对殖民地、半殖民地民族独立运动进行干涉，并且加强血腥镇压和继续进行侵略战争，如在阿尔及利亚所进行的一样。
    因此，双方认为，反对帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策，争取自由与和平的坚决斗争是世界各国人民的迫切的、首要的政治任务，这个任务要求他们团结起来。双方承认，殖民地、半殖民地的民族解放运动和世界各国人民争取民主和社会进步的行动，对上述这个斗争都作出了重大的贡献。
    双方高兴地看到，世界各国人民反对帝国主义的运动正在越来越深入和广泛地发展。双方坚信：只要人民坚持斗争，结成反对帝国主义广泛的统一战线，就一定能够击败帝国主义和殖民主义，获得和维护民族独立，保卫住世界和平。
    双方满意地看到，世界上的民族解放运动正在蓬勃地向前发展，特别是非洲大陆人民争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争已经形成了一股不可抗拒的洪流。双方热烈祝贺许多非洲国家赢得了独立，热烈祝贺亚洲、非洲和各国人民在共同斗争中的友谊和团结正在日益加强，并且预祝还在殖民主义统治下的各国人民争取民族独立的斗争早日胜利。双方庄严地宣布：坚决支持刚果人民、古巴人民和殖民地和半殖民地以及其他各国人民争取和维护民族独立的正义斗争。双方严厉地谴责北大西洋公约组织国家的政府，主要是美国政府，支持法国政府的殖民镇压和继续侵略阿尔及利亚的战争。双方向世界各国人民特别是亚非各国政府和人民呼吁，希望他们采取有效措施，坚决支持这些国家人民维护和争取民族独立的正义斗争，坚决制止干涉和侵略的罪行。
    在会谈中，中国方面对阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府和民族解放阵线领导下的阿尔及利亚人民为争取民族独立而进行的英勇斗争表示赞扬，并且严厉地反对和谴责法帝国主义在美帝国主义支持下对阿尔及利亚所进行的殖民战争和侵略罪行。中国政府重申其始终不渝地帮助和支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争的坚定立场。中国政府支持坚持和加强武装斗争的阿尔及利亚人民在争取民族独立的战斗中，不排除在平等基础上进行的谈判，这种谈判有助于揭露对方的欺骗。中国政府坚信，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民在世界各国人民支持下坚持斗争，一定能够战胜一切侵略者，全部彻底地解放自己的国土，取得民族解放斗争的最后胜利。
    阿尔及利亚方面对中国政府和人民始终不渝地为维护世界和平、实现普遍裁军、禁止核武器、倡导和贯彻和平共处的五项原则、增强亚非各国的团结合作，所作的一系列巨大努力和贡献，以及在反对帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，支持殖民地半殖民地国家人民争取民族独立的斗争、支持各国人民争取和平、民主和社会进步的斗争中，所采取的坚定不移的正义立场，表示钦佩；并且完全支持中国人民解放自己的领土台湾的正义斗争。
