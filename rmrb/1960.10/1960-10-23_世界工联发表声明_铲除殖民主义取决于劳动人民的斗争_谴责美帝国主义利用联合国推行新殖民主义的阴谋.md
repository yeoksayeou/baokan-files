    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 21st: The World Federation of Trade Unions today issued a statement here on trade unions combating colonialism. The statement said that the World Federation of Trade Unions is determined to carry out the most effective work to finally and completely eliminate colonialism, and believes that trade union organizations in all countries and regions, as well as international trade union organizations, can and should discuss and consult with each other on the issue of uniting to wage a vigorous joint struggle to eradicate colonialism.
    The statement emphasized that in the past fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have been liberated from the shackles of colonialism. However, millions of people are still under colonial oppression. The statement said, "Due to the victories and sacrifices of the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, due to the brilliant example and peaceful policies of the socialist camp, and due to the solidarity of workers and trade unions in various countries, it is now possible and necessary to stop colonial oppression."
    The statement went on to emphasize that the decisive factor in eradicating the hateful colonial system is the united struggle of the working people, especially the struggle of the people in countries still under oppression. The statement said that this is the way to thwart the conspiracy of the imperialists, who were forced to vote in favor of including the anti-colonialism issue on the agenda of the 15th United Nations General Assembly.
    The statement said, "Experience shows that US imperialism will do everything possible to use the United Nations to oppose the movement of the people of all countries to fight for national independence."
    The statement reminded workers and trade unions in all countries that they must also oppose neo-colonialism. US imperialists and their allies are using neo-colonialism in an attempt to expand and strengthen their influence in colonies and newly independent countries.

    世界工联发表声明
    铲除殖民主义取决于劳动人民的斗争
    谴责美帝国主义利用联合国推行新殖民主义的阴谋
    新华社布拉格21日电　世界工会联合会今天在这里发表了关于工会制止殖民主义的声明。声明说，世界工会联合会决心为最后和彻底制止殖民主义进行最有效的工作，并且认为，一切国家、地区的工会组织和国际工会组织能够而且应该就联合起来为铲除殖民主义进行强有力的联合斗争的问题进行讨论，并且彼此协商。
    声明着重指出，在过去十五年中，亿万人民已经从殖民主义的束缚下获得了解放。但是，现在仍然有千百万人处在殖民压迫之下。声明说，“由于非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲国家人民的胜利和牺牲，由于社会主义阵营的光辉的榜样和和平政策，由于各国工人和工会的团结，今天已经有可能而且有必要制止殖民主义压迫。”
    声明接着强调指出，铲除可恨的殖民体系的决定性因素是劳动人民的联合斗争，特别是仍然受压迫的各国人民的斗争。声明说，这是挫败被迫在第十五届联合国大会上投票同意把反殖民主义问题列入大会议程的帝国主义者的阴谋的办法。
    声明说，“经验表明，美帝国主义将会千方百计地利用联合国来反对各国人民争取民族独立的运动。”
    声明提醒各国工人和工会说，他们也必须反对新殖民主义。美帝国主义分子和他们的同盟者正在利用新殖民主义，企图扩大和加强他们在殖民地和新获得独立的国家的势力。
