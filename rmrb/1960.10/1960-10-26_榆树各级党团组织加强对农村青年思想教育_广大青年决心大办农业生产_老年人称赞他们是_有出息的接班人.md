Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Telegram – Party and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels in Yushu County, Jilin Province, attach importance to strengthening ideological education for young people, care for their studies and lives, and 70,000 young people across the county are settling down to farming, determined to be both Red and expert in the countryside. The older generation is satisfied and praises them as "promising successors."

The Yushu County Party Committee has always regarded educating the younger generation as an important part of its work in every movement, and has instructed the Communist Youth League committees at all levels to specifically carry out this work. In the "Vigorously Develop Agriculture, Vigorously Develop Grain Production" movement, the Communist Youth League committees at all levels, according to the instructions of the Yushu County Party Committee and in line with the characteristics of young people, further carried out "Five Loves" activities among the broad masses of young people: love of the countryside, love of labor, love of public property, love of the collective, and love of learning. The Youth League organized young people to study the deeds of Xing Yanzi and others, and also established Qiao Deshan as a model for young people in the county who love the countryside. Qiao Deshan returned to the Fuli Management District of the Wukeshu Commune to participate in production in early July 1957, after graduating from junior high school. For more than three years, he has worked hard, overcome many difficulties, learned what he did not understand, and taken veteran peasants as his teachers, becoming an "all-around expert in the fields." He was rated as a red banner bearer on the province's agricultural front. The Youth League organizations at all levels called on young people to learn from Xing Yanzi and Qiao Deshan, and also organized various activities, such as Youth League classes, Youth League member and youth get-togethers, etc., organized the broad masses of young people to study Chairman Mao's works, and established models through newspapers, radio, etc. Through extensive publicity, extensive discussions, and the development of a socialist emulation campaign to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the advanced, the broad masses of young people have further established the idea that "farming is glorious." Many young people said, "Stepping on yellow mud, whipping the old ox, without farmers, everyone would be worried." More than 43,000 young people in the county have subscribed to Red and Expert plans, determined to be both Red and expert in the countryside. Yu Guizhen, the women's captain of the third team of the Jinjia Management District of the Yushu Town Commune, not only settled down to agricultural production herself, but also wrote letters to encourage her fiancé, Gong Shenglin, to return to his hometown to participate in production. With Yu Guizhen's help, Gong Shenglin has now been rated as a "Five-Good" commune member.

While carrying out ideological education for the broad masses of young people, Party and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels also used various forms to publicize the truth that "young people have a lot to offer in the countryside" to parents, encouraging them to encourage their children to settle down to farming. More than 70 parents from Gongpengzi, Xinzhuang, Daling and other communes wrote letters to their children in other places after listening to the propaganda, mobilizing them to return to the agricultural production front. After the Gonghe Management District of the Gongpengzi Commune held a forum for parents and students, five parents mobilized their sons to return to their hometown to produce. Old commune member Xu Xin mobilized his two junior high school graduates to participate in production. His son, Xu Shuchang, has now become an expert in the fields.

Party and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels also vigorously develop spare-time education. The county has held various technical training classes, and the communes have established spare-time technical schools. Many young people have planted experimental fields, and through these methods, they have cultivated a large number of technical talents. At present, more than 500 young people in the county have learned to drive and repair tractors, more than 300 young people have learned to operate power machinery, more than 2,100 young people have learned to cultivate fine seeds, and more than 300 young people have learned plant grafting. On the animal husbandry front, more than 2,500 young people have learned artificial insemination and epidemic prevention. The communes also vigorously organized spare-time cultural learning. At present, more than 500 junior high school graduates have entered spare-time high school classes, more than 4,500 senior elementary school graduates have reached the junior high school level, and 2,100 illiterate people have reached the senior elementary school level.

Party and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels are also very concerned about the lives of young people, specifically helping them arrange their lives, and correctly dealing with marriage issues. At present, many young couples have been rated as model couples.

    中共榆树县委在历次运动中，都把教育青年一代作为一项重要的工作内容，责成各级团委具体做这项工作。在“大办农业，大办粮食”运动中，各级团委根据中共榆树县委的指示，结合青年的特点，在广大青年中进一步开展了热爱农村、热爱劳动、爱护公共财产、热爱集体、爱学习的“五爱”活动。组织青年学习了邢燕子等人的事迹，还树立了乔德山为本县青年热爱农村的标兵。乔德山从1957年7月初中毕业后，就回到五棵树公社福利管理区参加生产，三年多来发愤图强，克服了重重困难，不懂就学，拜老农为师，成为“庄稼地里的全把式”，被评为省农业战线上的红旗手。各级团组织号召青年们向邢燕子、乔德山学习，同时还组织各种活动，如团课、团员和青年联欢晚会等，组织广大青年学习毛主席著作，通过报纸、广播等大树标兵。通过大宣传、大讨论和开展学、赶、比先进的社会主义大竞赛，使广大青年进一步树立了“务农光荣”的思想，许多青年说：“脚踩黄泥土，鞭打老黄牛，没有庄稼人，人人都发愁。”全县有四万三千多名青年订了红专规划，决心红在农村、专在农村。榆树镇公社靳家管理区第三队妇女队长于桂珍，不但自己安心农业生产，还写信动员她的未婚夫巩盛林回乡参加生产，巩盛林在于桂珍的帮助下，现在已被评为“五好”社员。
    各级党、团组织在向广大青年进行思想教育的同时，还通过各种形式，向家长们宣传“青年在农村大有可为”的道理，让他们鼓励自己的子弟安心务农。弓棚子、新庄、大岭等公社的七十多名家长在听了宣传以后，写信给在外地的子弟，动员他们回到农业生产战线。弓棚子公社共和管理区召开家长和学生座谈会以后，有五名家长动员自己的儿子回乡生产。老社员徐信动员他家里的两名初中毕业生参加了生产，他的儿子徐树昌，现在已成为庄稼地里的一把好手。
    各级党、团组织还大办业余教育，县里举办了各种技术训练班，各公社建立了业余技术学校，许多青年种了试验田，通过这些办法培养了大批技术人材。现在，全县有五百多名青年学会了驾驶和修理拖拉机，三百多名青年学会了开动力机，二千一百多名青年学会了培育良种，三百多名青年学会了植物嫁接，在畜牧战线上，有二千五百多名青年学会了人工授精和防疫。各公社还大力组织业余文化学习，现在有五百多名初中毕业生进入业余高中班，四千五百多名高小毕业生达到初中水平，二千一百名文盲达到了高小程度。
