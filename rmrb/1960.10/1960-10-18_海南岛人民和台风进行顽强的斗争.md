Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 17th: The people in the areas of Hainan Island and the southern part of the Leizhou Peninsula, which were hit by the typhoon, are engaged in a tenacious struggle to restore production.

The center of this typhoon made landfall near Wenchang County in northeastern Hainan Island on the afternoon of the 11th, swept across northern Hainan Island, and entered the Beibu Gulf west of Hainan Island on the afternoon of the 12th.

After receiving the typhoon warning on the 9th, the Party committees at all levels in Hainan and Zhanjiang regions immediately mobilized urgently, making typhoon prevention the central task overriding everything else. They notified fishing boats at sea to return to port, mobilized the masses to inspect dikes and reservoirs, concentrated their efforts on harvesting various crops that were basically ripe, and made preparations for wind prevention, in order to minimize the losses caused by the typhoon. As soon as the typhoon hit, leading cadres at all levels went to the front lines to lead the masses in fighting the typhoon, floods, and sea tides. After stone slope protection of the Daishuiqiao Reservoir in Leinan County experienced slope collapse, Li Zhenxing, the first secretary of the county party committee, who was personally directing the rescue work there, immediately led the masses to jump into chest-deep water and, braving the gale, torrential waves, and rainstorms, rebuilt the stone slope protection. Under the selfless protection of cadres and the masses, all major reservoirs and seawalls in various places were safe. After the typhoon, all localities immediately shifted their focus to restoring production. The CPC Hainan District Committee transferred 180 cadres and medical personnel, led personally by responsible comrades such as the district party committee secretary and standing committee members, and went to the disaster-stricken counties on the 12th to assist the party committees at all levels in carrying out consolation and rescue work. Party committees at all levels also organized the masses to work around the clock to drain water and rescue the fallen rice crops. In order to help the people in the disaster areas hit by the typhoon to arrange their lives and quickly restore production, the government has successively allocated more than 800,000 yuan in disaster relief funds.

    海南岛人民和台风进行顽强的斗争
    据新华社广州17日电　广东省海南岛和雷州半岛南部受到台风侵袭地区的人民，正在为恢复生产进行顽强的斗争。
    这次台风中心于11日下午在海南岛东北部的文昌县附近登陆，掠过海南岛北部，于12日下午进入海南岛以西的北部湾海面。
    海南和湛江地区各级党委在9日接到台风警报以后，立即紧急动员起来，把防台风作为压倒一切的中心任务，通知出海的渔船回港，发动群众检查堤围、水库，集中力量抢收各种已经基本成熟的农作物和作好防风的准备，以最大限度地减少台风带来的损失。台风一到，各级领导干部都亲临前线，领导群众和台风、洪水、海潮搏斗。雷南县大水桥水库石护坡的石块发生塌坡的现象后，在那里亲自指挥抢险的县委第一书记李振兴立即带领群众跳进齐胸的水里，冒着狂风巨浪和暴雨的袭击，把护坡的石块重新砌好。在干部和群众奋不顾身的保护下，各地主要的水库和海堤全部安全。台风过后，各地立即把中心转入恢复生产，中共海南区党委抽调了一百八十名干部和医务工作者，由区党委书记、常委等负责同志亲自率领，于12日分赴受灾各县，协同各级党委进行慰问和抢救工作。各级党委也组织群众，连夜突击，排除积水，抢救倒伏的禾稻。为了帮助这次遭受台风袭击的灾区人民安排好生活和迅速恢复生产，政府已先后拨出救灾款八十多万元。
