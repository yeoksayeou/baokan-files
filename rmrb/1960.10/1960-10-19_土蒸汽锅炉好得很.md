The homemade steam boiler was developed by the Party branch secretary, Comrade Zhang Zhonggang, and several bricklayers and carpenters from our Hu Yue Production Team branch committee of the Dalu Village Commune in Ningjin County, after repeated research and experimentation during the great development of community dining halls. Its birth has played a significant role in consolidating and developing the community dining halls.

Simple Structure, Labor-Saving, and Material-Saving

The structure of the homemade steam boiler is extremely simple. It is made from a large wok, without using steel or cement. The method is as follows: first, build a stove with bricks, and place the wok on the stove. Then, build a half-foot high brick enclosure on the mouth of the wok, and cover it tightly with a one-foot high circular flat wooden lid. When in use, open a few air holes on one side of the wooden lid as needed (four to five are appropriate), and steam can be sent to the steamers through the air pipes to steam dry food. To maintain a certain amount of water in the wok, there is a water leak near the edge of the top lid for adding water. To know exactly how much water is in the wok, a "homemade water gauge" needs to be installed to measure the water level in the wok. The method for making a "homemade water gauge" is: weld a hollow ball out of tinplate, connect a thin iron wire to the ball, pass it from the center of the pot lid to the outside, the hollow ball floats on the water surface, and according to the up and down movement of the iron wire exposed outside, you can know how much water is in the pot.

Four Major Advantages

The homemade steam boiler has four major advantages:

\tI. This kind of homemade steam boiler has low cost and saves materials. The boiler is built with old bricks and old wood, without spending much money.
\tII. High efficiency, both fast and economical. A homemade steam boiler built with a "Three-Eight" wok can supply steam to five sets of steamers simultaneously (calculated with five sections per set of steamer). Generally, it takes about 25 minutes to steam six to seven hundred catties of dry food.
\tIII. Simple to operate, suitable for any size of dining hall and any number of diners.
\tIV. It can save labor and coal, and reduce expenses. Our team originally had 97 cooks and managers. After using homemade steam boilers and realizing semi-mechanization of cooking utensils, the number was reduced to 36, saving 61 people, and saving more than 20,000 catties of coal per month.

Not Bowing to Difficulties

The homemade steam boiler is a new thing. The emergence and growth of new things are never smooth sailing, and they will inevitably encounter many practical difficulties. According to our personal experience, first of all, the branch must have an unwavering determination, work hard to study, and rely on the masses. In early April, the commune party committee piloted community dining halls in our team, requiring the realization of steam cooking. At that time, we had neither boilers nor pot camel machines to replace them, and there was no steel to order them. What to do? There were two roads in front of us: one road was to wait for foreign boilers, and if we couldn't wait for foreign boilers, we wouldn't start community dining halls; the other road was to use indigenous methods and experiment with homemade boilers ourselves. After research and discussion, we believed that we could not bow to difficulties. If we didn't have "foreign" ones, we would do "homemade" ones. Indigenous methods can also be successful. After the branch made a resolution, the branch secretary, Comrade Zhang Zhonggang, held several discussions with kiln workers, bricklayers, and carpenters, and finally, based on the principles of foreign boilers, he figured out a way to use homemade steam. When Comrade Zhang Zhonggang reported his ideas to Zhao Rongshan, the first secretary of the commune party committee, he received strong support from Comrade Zhao Rongshan, who encouraged us and said: "Although homemade steam boilers are indigenous, they are of great significance. You must find a way to make them!"

This further encouraged our confidence and determination to make homemade steam boilers.

Where there is Confidence and Determination, there is a Way

Making homemade steam boilers is a new thing, and the masses have never seen or heard of it. After the news spread, most of the members actively supported it, but a few people doubted or even opposed it. They said: "Homemade steam boilers don't have pressure gauges. If the steam is too low, the food won't be cooked. If the steam is too high, the lid will fly to the sky. It's better to buy a foreign boiler, which is both good and safe." We took resolute measures, criticized the lazy thinking of those who only waited for foreign boilers, and started making homemade steam boilers.

To make new things, one must have a spirit of drive and perseverance. One must be prepared for success and also prepared for failure. If it fails, try again and again until it succeeds. On the first day of using the homemade steam boiler for cooking, because the lid was light and the steam was high, the lid was indeed about to fly to the sky. What to do? Easy! We pressed a large piece of wood on the lid to prevent it from "flying to the sky" again! The problem of the lid "flying to the sky" was solved, but other problems came up. The boiler initially did not have a "homemade water gauge," so it was impossible to measure the water level in the boiler. After steaming only a few cages, the boiler exploded. Some people started talking about it again. Some said "it won't work," some said "it's dangerous," and several cooks were also worried. After four days of research, we finally came up with the principle of "water rises, boat rises," and used a "water finger" to replace the water gauge. It was successful in one test, so the homemade steam boiler was resurrected. To prevent the boiler from exploding, we assigned a dedicated person to take turns watching the gauge and adding water, but as soon as water was added, the steam weakened, and the dry food was not cooked thoroughly, extending the steaming time for one cage of dry food to 40 minutes, sometimes more than an hour. How could this work? We continued to research and improve, looking for the reason why the steam weakened. Finally, everyone agreed that the weakening of steam might be because the water added was not hot. Later, it was decided to use a "connected stove" to prepare several pots of boiling water. After this improvement, the steam was indeed sufficient. Each time, five sets of steamers could be steamed, and the dry food could be steamed in about 25 minutes. This ensured that meals were served on time.

The homemade steam boiler is a new thing, and it must be continuously improved to make it more perfect. Currently, we are planning to improve and enhance it in three aspects: First, adding a blower to the stove can overcome the shortcomings of only being able to burn good coal and not being able to burn inferior coal, only being able to burn lumps and not being able to burn fines; Second, we plan to replace it with two homemade steam boilers or enlarge the boiler, which can further shorten the cooking time; Third, with the widespread promotion of homemade steam boilers, we are considering its comprehensive utilization, such as using it for rice and flour processing, water lifting, driving vegetable cutting machines, dough mixing machines, etc. In short, we must continue to research and improve it, so that it becomes increasingly perfect and its uses are more extensive.

    土蒸汽锅炉好得很
    中共宁晋县大陆村公社胡岳生产队支部委员会
    土蒸汽锅炉是我们在大办中心食堂中，由支部书记张中刚同志和几个瓦、木工人，经过多次研究、试验搞成的。它的诞生，对巩固、发展中心食堂起了很大作用。
    构造简单工省料少
    土蒸汽锅炉的构造极为简单，它是用一口大锅做成的，不用钢材，也不用水泥。做法是：首先用砖盘成锅灶，把锅放在锅灶上。然后在锅口上用砖砌起半尺高的围圈，上面用一个一尺高的圆形平顶木盖盖严。使用时根据需要在木盖的一边开几个出气孔（四至五个为宜），通过气管把蒸汽送到蒸笼内就可以蒸干粮。为了使锅里保持一定的水量，顶盖上面靠边处有个水漏子，在添水时用。为了知道锅里到底有多少水，需要安装一个“土水表”，用来测量锅里的水位。“土水表”的做法：用白铁片焊成一个空心球，球上接一根细铁丝，从锅盖的顶中央通到外边来，空心球飘浮在水面上，根据露在外边的铁丝的上下移动情况，就可以知道锅里有多少水。
    四大优点
    土蒸汽锅炉具有四大优点：
    一、这种土蒸汽锅炉成本低，用料节省。建锅炉用的是旧砖、旧木料，不用多花钱。
    二、功效大，既快又省。用三八大锅建造的土蒸汽锅炉，可以同时向五套蒸笼供汽（每套蒸笼安五节计算），一般用二十五分钟左右的时间，就可以蒸熟六、七百斤干粮。
    三、操作简单，不论食堂大小、吃饭人员多少都可以用。
    四、可以节省劳力和煤炭，减少开支。我队原有炊事员和管理员九十七名，使用土蒸汽锅炉和炊具实现半机械化后减少到三十六名，节省了六十一名，一个月还节省两万多斤煤。
    不向困难低头
    土蒸汽锅炉是一个新东西。新东西的出现和成长都不是一帆风顺的，必然会遇到许多实际困难。根据我们亲身的经历，首先支部必须有坚定不移的决心，苦心钻研，依靠群众。4月初，公社党委在我队试办中心食堂，要求实现蒸汽做饭。当时我们一没有锅炉，二没有锅驼机代替，定做又没有钢材，怎么办呢？摆在我们面前有两条道路：一条道路是等着洋锅炉，等不到洋锅炉就先别搞中心食堂；另一条道路是土法上马，自己动手试验土锅炉。经过研究讨论，认为不能向困难低头，没有“洋”的我们就干“土”的，土法也能上马。支部作出决议之后，支部书记张中刚同志就找烧窑工、瓦工、木工多次座谈研究，终于根据洋锅炉的道理，琢磨出了利用土蒸汽的办法。当张中刚同志把自己琢磨的意见向公社党委第一书记赵荣善同志汇报后，得到了赵荣善同志的大力支持，并鼓励我们说：“土蒸汽锅炉虽然土，但是意义很大，你们一定要想法子搞成！”
    这就更加鼓舞了我们搞土蒸汽锅炉的信心和决心。
    有信心有决心就有办法
    搞土蒸汽锅炉是新事，群众没有见过也没有听说过。这个消息传开后，多数社员积极拥护，但也有少数人怀疑，甚至反对。他们说：“土蒸汽锅炉没个有气压表，汽小了蒸不熟饭，汽大了锅盖得上了天，不如买个洋锅炉，既好又保险。”我们采取了坚决的措施，批判了那些只等洋锅炉的懒汉思想，搞起了土蒸气锅炉。
    要搞新东西，就必须有一股子干劲和顽强的精神，既要准备成功，又要准备失败，失败了再干，一直干到成功。就在利用土蒸汽锅炉做饭的第一天，由于锅盖轻，蒸汽大，果然锅盖要上天了。怎么办？好办！我们在锅盖上压了一根大木头，看你再“上天”！锅盖“上天”的问题解决了，别的问题又来了。锅炉起初没有“土水表”，无法测量锅炉内的水位，蒸了不多几笼，锅炉就烧炸了。有些人又七嘴八舌地谈论开了。有的说“不行”，有的说“危险”，几个炊事员也发了愁。我们经过四天的研究，终于想出了利用“水涨船高”的道理，用“水指子”来代替水表，一试验果然成功了，于是土蒸汽锅炉又复活了。为防止锅炉爆炸，我们固定专人轮流看表添水，但是一添水蒸汽就减弱，干粮蒸不熟，蒸一笼干粮延长到四十分钟，有时一个多钟头。这怎么能行呢？我们继续研究改进，寻找蒸汽减弱的道理。最后大家一致认为，蒸汽减弱可能是因为添的水不热，后来决定利用“连火灶”，准备几锅开水，这样改进后，蒸汽果然很足了，每次能蒸五套蒸笼，大约二十五分钟就可以把干粮蒸熟。这样，就保证了按时开饭。
    土蒸汽锅炉是新生事物，必须不断改进才能使它更加完善。目前我们正打算从三方面改进提高它：第一、在灶上加个鼓风机，可以克服只能烧好煤不能烧次煤，只能烧块不能烧末的缺点；第二、我们打算改用两个土蒸汽锅炉或把锅炉加大，这样做饭时间还能缩短；第三、随着土蒸汽锅炉的普遍推行，我们正考虑它的综合利用，如用它进行米面加工、提水，带动切菜机、合面机等。总之，要不断研究改进，使它日趋完善，用途更加广泛。
