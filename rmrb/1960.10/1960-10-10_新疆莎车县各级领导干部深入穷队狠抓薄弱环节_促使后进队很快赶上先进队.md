Kashgar, Xinjiang—Leaders at all levels in Shache County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, have gone deep into poor and backward teams to vigorously grasp weak links and adhere to participating in production to lead production. This has led to rapid changes in the faces of 114 poor and backward production brigades across the county, showing a new situation of substantial increases in production and continuous improvement in the enthusiasm of the masses.

Shache County is the largest agricultural county in Xinjiang, and the number of poor and backward teams accounts for more than 28% of the county's 396 production brigades. At the beginning of this year, under the guidance of the policy of accelerating the development of agricultural production, the Shache County Party Committee seriously examined the work style of leaders at all levels and found that leaders at the commune and management district levels generally preferred to go to rich and advanced teams and were unwilling to go to poor and backward teams. Based on these situations, the Shache County Party Committee first conducted ideological education among leaders at all levels and adopted the method of assigning areas of responsibility and taking responsibility to the end. Fifty-three responsible cadres at the commune and management district levels were sent to settle down in poor and backward teams, and ninety-seven leaders were assigned to stay in these production brigades for a long time to take full responsibility, fundamentally changing the past situation where leaders would grasp and then release poor and backward teams.

After leaders at all levels went down, they adhered to the work style of participating in production to lead production. Tu Xunhan, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of A'reli Commune, insisted on working with commune members from spring sowing to summer harvest after arriving at the first team of the fourth management district, overfulfilling production tasks every day. Under her leadership, all seventeen team cadres actively participated in labor. Tuo Hesheng Sila Mu, director of the Fourth Management District of Kamel Commune, served as deputy secretary of the branch in the most backward production brigade of the commune. He and the thirty-three cadres of the whole brigade adhered to the system of five days of labor and two days of work. Because cadres and commune members worked together and discussed matters together, the enthusiasm of commune members was doubled. The 435 commune members of the whole brigade worked an average of more than twenty-six days per month in the first half of the year, an increase of 42% over the same period last year, and all aspects of production strived to be among the best in several evaluations. Leaders at all levels also actively cultivated activists and expanded the ranks of the Party and the League based on the characteristics of the weak Party and League forces in poor and backward teams. The number of Party members in poor and backward teams across the county increased from 699 last year to 1,014, and the number of League members increased from more than 700 to more than 1,170.

In order to enable poor and backward teams to catch up with rich and advanced teams quickly in production, leaders at all levels implemented the policy of taking grain as the key link and diversifying operations in leading production, and led these production brigades to actively expand cultivated land area and increase yield per unit area. This year, the area of grain crops in 114 poor and backward production brigades across the county increased by more than 37,000 mu; cotton also expanded by 24.9% compared with last year; and the number of sideline production projects generally increased compared with last year.

After leaders at all levels went to poor and backward teams, they also focused on farmland capital construction and conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture in view of the poor natural conditions, insufficient labor and animal power, and extensive cultivation of these production brigades. This year, 710 large and small canals and 150 alkali drainage ditches were newly dug. The cadres sent by Kamel Commune to poor and backward teams adopted the method of mobilizing commune members to make detailed calculations and visiting advanced teams to learn from them, improving and creating various agricultural tools, greatly improving work efficiency, and solving the contradiction of insufficient labor force.

    新疆莎车县各级领导干部深入穷队狠抓薄弱环节
    促使后进队很快赶上先进队
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区莎车县各级领导干部深入到穷队和落后队狠抓薄弱环节，坚持参加生产领导生产，使全县一百一十四个贫穷落后的生产大队面貌迅速改变，出现了生产大幅度上升，群众干劲不断高涨的新局面。
    莎车县是新疆最大的农业县，穷队和落后队的数量占全县三百九十六个生产大队的28％以上。今年年初，中共莎车县委在加速发展农业生产的方针下，认真检查了各级领导作风，发现在公社和管理区级领导干部中，一般都愿意到富队和先进队去，不愿到穷队、落后队去。根据这些情况，中共莎车县委首先在各级领导干部中进行了思想教育，并且采取了分片包干、一包到底的办法，下放了五十三名公社和管理区一级的负责干部到穷队、落后队安家落户，并且指派了九十七名领导干部到这些生产大队长期蹲点固定包干，根本改变了过去领导上对穷队和落后队抓一抓，放一放的状况。
    各级领导干部下去后，坚持参加生产领导生产的工作作风，阿热力公社的党委副书记吐逊汗衣提到四管理区一大队后，从春播到夏收一直坚持和社员一起干活，日日超额完成生产任务，在她的带动下全队十七名大队干部，都积极参加劳动。卡米尔公社四管理区主任托合生司拉木到公社最落后的生产大队担任支部副书记，他和全大队的三十三名干部坚持五天劳动、两天工作的制度。由于干部和社员一起劳动，共同商量，社员干劲倍增，全大队四百三十五名社员，上半年出勤天数每人每月平均二十六天多，比去年同期提高了42％，各项生产在数次评比中都争得上游。各级领导干部还根据穷队和落后队党、团力量弱的特点，积极培养了积极分子，扩大了党团的队伍，全县穷队和落后队的党员由去年的六百九十九名增加到一千零一十四名，团员由七百多名发展到一千一百七十多名。
    为了使穷队和落后队在生产上很快赶上富队、先进队，各级领导干部在领导生产上都贯彻了以粮为纲、多种经营的方针，领导这些生产大队积极扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量。今年全县一百一十四个贫穷落后生产大队的粮食作物面积扩大了三万七千多亩；棉花也比去年扩大了24.9％；副业生产项目普遍比去年增加。
    各级领导干部到穷队和落后队后，还针对这些生产大队自然条件差、劳畜力不足、耕作粗放等情况，大抓农田基本建设，认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”，今年新挖大小渠道七百一十条、排碱沟一百五十条。卡米尔公社下放到穷队和落后队的干部，采取发动社员算细账、到先进队参观学习的办法，改进和创制了各种农具，大大提高了工效，解决了劳力不足的矛盾。（附图片）
