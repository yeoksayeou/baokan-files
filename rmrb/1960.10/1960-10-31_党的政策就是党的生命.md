    The Party's Policies are the Lifeblood of the Party
    We Must Act in Accordance with the Party's Policies
    Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Policy and tactics are the life of the Party." ("Circular on the Situation," Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. IV) He also said, "The basic task of the leading bodies of the Communist Party lies in knowing the situation and grasping policy, the former meaning knowing the world and the latter meaning transforming the world." ("Reform Our Study," Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. III) In all the work of the Party, the correct implementation of the Party's policies is of paramount importance.
    The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong regard policy as the life of the Party and grasping policy as a weapon for transforming the world because all the Party's policies serve one purpose: to establish the closest ties with the broadest masses of people and to rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and organize the masses to realize their own demands for liberation. The interests of the broadest masses of people are the highest standard of the Party's policies. The reason why our Party can gain the support and trust of the broad masses is that the Party's various policies are correct, directly and centrally embodying the fundamental interests of the proletariat and other working people; taking into account the needs of the state, the collective, and the individual; correctly combining long-term interests with immediate interests, overall interests with partial interests, and collective interests with individual interests; and being good at constantly adjusting relations in various aspects through the correct implementation of policies, correctly handling various contradictions, and maximizing the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses.
    The Party's policies are the guide for all cadres in carrying out their work. To arm the broad masses of cadres ideologically, we must arm them with Marxism-Leninism, with Mao Zedong Thought, and with the Party's policy thinking. The Party's policy thinking is a concrete manifestation of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the practice of revolution and construction in our country, and is a concrete manifestation of Mao Zedong Thought in the Party's various tasks. All the Party's work is inseparable from policy. The Party's policies are transmitted to the masses through the cadres and are realized by the cadres organizing the masses, and all the work of the Party's cadres is to correctly implement the Party's policies. Whether we do our work well depends on whether we understand the Party's policies correctly and implement them resolutely. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Any action by a revolutionary party is the implementation of policy. If it is not implementing a correct policy, it is implementing a wrong policy; if it is not implementing a policy consciously, it is implementing some policy blindly." ("On the Policy Concerning Industry and Commerce," Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. IV) Comrade Mao Zedong closely linked the practice of revolutionary parties and revolutionary masses with the Party's policies, and demanded that all our cadres be good at using policies, which profoundly illustrates this point.
    Today, the reason why we emphasize the great significance of the Party's policies is that some of our comrades still do not have a strong sense of policy, and do not understand the immeasurable significance of resolutely and correctly implementing the Party's policies in all their work for uniting the broad masses to carry out revolution and construction. Therefore, greatly strengthening the Party's policy concept among all Party cadres is a major matter for raising the communist consciousness of the broad masses of cadres, raising the level of Marxism-Leninism, and improving the style of leadership thinking. To firmly establish the Party's policy concept among the broad masses of cadres is to act in accordance with the Party's policies in all work. Some comrades do not sufficiently recognize the seriousness of this issue, do not understand that the Party's policy concept and the mass concept are consistent, and their failure to conscientiously implement the Party's policies is a manifestation of a weak mass concept. This is because the Party's policies concentrate the wisdom and experience of the broad masses, come from the masses, and are products of the mass line. The Party's policies are also the guide for the masses' struggle, and all the goals it puts forward must rely on the masses themselves to struggle and strive to achieve, and it also requires returning to the masses, which is the concrete application of the mass line. Without the Party's policy concept, without acting in accordance with the Party's policies in all work, there is no such thing as a mass concept.
    After the cadres have studied and understood the Party's policies, they must publicize and explain them to the masses, so that the Party's policies can meet with the masses, turn the Party's proposals into the masses' own proposals, and turn the Party's policies into the masses' conscious actions. Therefore, we are required to comprehensively and deeply publicize and explain the Party's policies. We must not only explain the general significance of the policies, but also explain the specific steps and methods for implementing the policies; not only explain the relationship between the policies and the current immediate interests of the masses, but also explain their relationship to long-term interests; not only explain to the advanced sections of the masses, but also explain to the backward sections whose level of consciousness has not yet been raised temporarily. We cannot only talk about one side and not the other, let alone replace policies with feelings. Only when the policies meet with the masses can the Party's policies be supervised by the masses and guaranteed to be realized. It is completely wrong to put the Party's policies in one's pocket, thinking that it is enough for oneself to know, without announcing them to the masses. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Being good at turning the Party's policies into the actions of the masses, being good at making every one of our movements and every one of our struggles understood and grasped not only by the leading cadres but also by the broad masses, is a Marxist-Leninist art of leadership. The boundary line of whether our work is making mistakes or not lies here." ("Talk to the Editorial Staff of the Jin-Sui Daily," Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. IV)
    To act in accordance with the Party's policies, we must clarify the view that tasks and policies are consistent, and that being responsible to the people and being responsible to the Party's leading organs are consistent; we must oppose the erroneous view that tasks and policies are opposed, and that only tasks are talked about but not policies. This is the fundamental guarantee for completing various tasks. All the tasks put forward by the Party are put forward based on the development of the objective situation and the urgent demands of the broad masses, and all major tasks must mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses to be completed. The fundamental key to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses lies in grasping the masses through policies and correctly implementing policies. The more vigorously the Party's policies are implemented, the better the tasks will be completed.
    To act in accordance with the Party's policies, it also requires the leading organs to timely and effectively check the implementation of policies. The responsibility of leadership is to give ideas and use cadres. The so-called giving ideas is to formulate correct policies based on the situation of revolution and construction and the demands of the masses; the so-called using cadres is to boldly use cadres who can correctly implement policies. Whether the ideas are given well and whether the cadres are used properly must be checked frequently and experience must be summarized. The checking of work mainly involves checking the implementation of policies; the summarizing of experience also mainly involves summarizing the experience of implementing policies. Without checking the implementation of policies, the leadership work cannot take root in practical work and among the masses. This matter cannot be taken lightly.
    To act in accordance with the Party's policies, in the final analysis, is a question of whether every Party member and every cadre has a strong sense of the Party and a sense of the masses. We Communist Party members are conscious vanguard fighters of the proletariat, and are concrete representatives of the conscious class interests and class will. Political struggle is one of the forms of class struggle, and the ideology and consciousness of the proletariat are most completely and concretely manifested in the position and attitude taken by the proletariat towards the political struggle at that time, and in the line and policy adopted towards the current political struggle. Correctly implementing the Party's policies is the position and attitude we take towards various basic and major issues in the current political struggle, which is to establish the closest ties with the broadest masses of people and to wholeheartedly serve the responsible spirit of the masses. This view of ours on the people is the view of the proletarian mass line that must be possessed in implementing the Party's policies, and this relationship between us and the masses and the method of contacting the masses is the method of the mass line for implementing policies. As long as we use the viewpoint and method of the mass line to resolutely and correctly implement the Party's policies in all our work, we will surely advance from victory to greater victory.
    (Excerpted from the commentary in the 20th issue of Shanghai's *Liberation*)

    Fully Unleash the Power of Policy

    We know that to do anything well, the decisive factor is people. Any undertaking is done by people. As long as the enthusiasm and creativity of the people are brought into play, everything will be easy. Chairman Mao taught us: "Of all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any human miracle can be created." (*Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Vol. IV) If we are to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, we must rely on the enthusiasm of the people, especially the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants. But how can the enthusiasm of the people be fully brought into play? This lies in ensuring that the masses can fully appreciate that the cause advocated by the Party is for their own vital interests, and that the masses will actively act according to the Party's guidelines. The Party's policy is the regularization of the Party's program, line, and principles. By earnestly implementing the various policies stipulated by the Party, the enthusiasm of the masses will be mobilized. The work we do every day is to implement policies. Chairman Mao said in his 1948 article "On the Policy Concerning Industry and Commerce," "Policy is the starting point of all practical actions of a revolutionary party, and is manifested in the process and outcome of actions. Any action of a revolutionary party is the implementation of policy. If it is not implementing a correct policy, it is implementing a wrong policy; if it is not implementing a policy consciously, it is implementing some policy blindly." He also said, "Only when all the Party's policies and tactics are on the right track will the Chinese revolution be possible to win." (*Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Vol. IV) All these illustrate the great power of the Party's policy. The Party's policy is the driving force for promoting the revolutionary cause and the lever for achieving the established goals of the revolution.
    To fully unleash the power of the Party's policy, we must implement the Party's policy well. To implement the Party's policy well, we must raise the awareness of cadres in implementing the Party's policy, and this awareness is built on a deep understanding of the Party's policy in each period. In each revolutionary stage, the Party has general policies and specific policies, which are formulated based on the level of social productive forces, the level of awareness and organization of the masses, the interests of the state and the masses, the long-term and current interests, and so on in a certain period. For each policy issued by the Party, we should carefully think, carefully study, and think about why such a policy should be adopted instead of other policies, what is the objective background of this policy? What is its basic starting point? For example, in the policy provisions of the People's Commune, determining that the team should be the foundation, and that the policies of distribution according to work and equivalent exchange should be implemented, are policies that must be implemented in the current period of socialist construction. Because only by implementing these policies can it suit today's social production level and the people's level of awareness, and only then will it be conducive to the development of production and create the necessary material basis for building socialism and transitioning to communism. Some comrades do not understand this point and often mistakenly use our long-term goals to conceive current policies, taking policies that can only be implemented tomorrow to implement today; or emphasizing that their own situation is special, they do not conscientiously implement the Party's policies, or they replace policies with their own feelings, and randomly come up with a set of ideas. As a result, it has caused great damage to the Party's cause. The Party's current policy can be compared to a ferry boat parked on the shore. If you want to cross the river, you must take this ferry boat to reach the other shore. Taking the ferry boat is an insurmountable step. Therefore, we must always pay attention to clearly demarcating the policy boundaries of each revolutionary stage and clarify the connection and difference between the Party's current policies and the Party's ultimate goals. Only in this way can we treat the Party's various policies with a correct attitude.
    To implement the Party's policies well, it is also necessary to make party organizations and cadres at all levels aware of the seriousness of the Party's policies. Resolutely oppose the unorganized and undisciplined behavior in the treatment of the Party's policies. Chairman Mao said: "Policy and tactics are the life of the Party, and leading comrades at all levels must pay full attention and must not be careless." (*Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Vol. IV) He also said: "It is necessary to resolutely overcome the certain state of indiscipline or anarchy that exists in many places, that is, to arbitrarily revise the policies and tactics of the Central Committee or the higher-level party committee, and to implement their own extremely harmful policies and tactics that violate unified will and unified discipline; under the pretext of busy work, to adopt the wrong attitude of not asking for instructions beforehand and not reporting afterwards, and to regard the places they manage as if they were an independent country. This state of affairs causes extremely great damage to the interests of the revolution." (*Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Vol. IV) Every revolutionary cadre of ours should always remember Chairman Mao's teachings on the importance of policy and the seriousness of the implementation of policy. Article 2 of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China stipulates that conscientiously implementing the Party's policies and resolutions is the obligation of a Communist Party member, and every revolutionary cadre should also be like this. Implementing the Party's policies should be regarded as a sacred duty and a serious political task.
    To implement the policies well, it is also necessary to highlight the link of mobilizing the masses. No matter how good the Party's policies are, if they are not handed over to the masses and allowed the masses to master them, the policies cannot be truly implemented. The enthusiasm of the masses will not be mobilized. Therefore, it is currently necessary to fully mobilize the masses and let the masses and cadres implement the policies together. Chairman Mao said, "Our policies should not only be known to the leaders and cadres, but also to the broad masses." "The basic principle of Marxism-Leninism is to make the masses aware of their own interests and unite to fight for their own interests." "In the leading organs of some of our places, some people think that the Party's policies only need to be known to the leaders and do not need to be known to the masses. This is one of the basic reasons why some of our work cannot be done well." (*Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Vol. IV) Only when the policies are handed over and accepted and mastered by the broad masses can they be turned into a huge material force.
    Who should hand over the policies to the masses? It is up to the cadres to hand them over. If the cadres want to truly "hand over" the policies well, they must first further study well, change their work style, go deep to the bottom, deep into the small teams, to the work groups, to the homes of the commune members, explain the policies to the masses item by item, let the masses speak freely and debate item by item, and the cadres and the masses together, meticulously and concretely solve practical problems one by one in accordance with the Party's policies, advocating publicizing one item, implementing one item, implementing one item, and fulfilling one item. Currently, to focus on implementing policies, we must first focus on the work style of cadres. Only when the work style of cadres is more in-depth can we rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and implement the policies to the end.

### 党的政策就是党的生命

专栏：报刊文摘

    党的政策就是党的生命
    一定要按照党的政策办事
    毛泽东同志说：“政策和策略是党的生命”。（《关于情况的通报》《毛泽东选集》第四卷）又说：“共产党领导机关的基本任务，就在于了解情况和掌握政策两件大事，前一件事就是所谓认识世界，后一件事就是所谓改造世界。”（《改造我们的学习》《毛泽东选集》第三卷）在党的一切工作中，正确地贯彻执行党的政策，有着头等重要的意义。
    党和毛泽东同志把政策看作是党的生命，把掌握政策看作是改造世界的武器，这是由于党的一切政策都服务于一个目的，就是和最广大的群众取得最密切的联系，并依靠群众、发动群众、组织群众，实现他们自己解放自己的要求。最广大的人民群众的利益，就是党的政策的最高标准。我们党之所以能够得到广大群众的拥护和信赖，就是由于党的各项政策是正确的，它最直接、最集中地体现了无产阶级及其他劳动人民的根本利益；照顾到国家、集体和个人三方面的需要，把长远利益和目前利益、整体利益和局部利益、集体利益和个人的利益正确地结合起来；善于通过政策的正确执行，不断调整各方面的关系，正确处理各种矛盾，最大限度地调动起广大群众的社会主义积极性。
    党的政策，是一切干部进行工作的指针。我们要在思想上武装广大干部，就是要用马克思列宁主义、用毛泽东思想来武装广大干部，就是要用党的政策思想来武装广大干部。党的政策思想是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和我国革命和建设实践相结合的具体表现，是毛泽东思想在党的各项工作中的具体表现。党的一切工作都离不开政策。党的政策通过干部传达到群众中去，又通过干部组织群众去实现，党的干部的一切工作，就是正确地贯彻执行党的政策。我们工作做得好不好，就要看我们对党的政策理解得是否正确，执行得是否坚决。毛泽东同志说：“一个革命政党的任何行动都是实行政策。不是实行正确的政策，就是实行错误的政策；不是自觉地，就是盲目地实行某种政策。”（《关于工商业政策》，《毛泽东选集》第四卷）毛泽东同志把革命政党和革命群众的实践，紧紧地与党的政策联系起来，并要求我们一切干部善于运用政策，正深刻地说明了这一点。
    今天，我们所以要强调党的政策的重大意义，是因为我们有些同志的政策观念还不强，还不懂得在一切工作中坚决地、正确地贯彻执行党的政策，对团结广大群众进行革命和建设，有着不可估量的意义。因此，在全党干部中，大大加强党的政策观念，是提高广大干部的共产主义觉悟，提高马克思列宁主义水平和改进领导思想作风的一件大事情。要在广大干部中牢固地树立起党的政策观念，就是为了在一切工作中，按照党的政策办事。有些同志对这个问题的严重性认识不足，不了解党的政策观念和群众观念两者是一致的，不认真执行党的政策，就是群众观念不强的表现。因为党的政策集中了广大群众的智慧和经验，是从群众中来的，是群众路线的产物。党的政策又是群众斗争的指针，它所提出的一切目标，要依靠群众自己去斗争，自己去争取才能实现，它又要求回到群众中去，是群众路线的具体运用。如果没有党的政策观念，不在一切工作中按照党的政策办事，也就无所谓群众观念。
    干部学习了、懂得了党的政策，还要向群众宣传解释，使党的政策和群众见面，把党的主张变为群众自己的主张，把党的政策变为群众自觉的行动。因此，就要求我们全面地，深入地宣传解释党的政策。不仅讲明政策的一般意义，而且讲明实行政策的具体步骤和方法；不仅讲明政策与当前群众的眼前利益的关系，更要讲明它对长远利益的关系；不仅向群众中先进部分讲，更要向觉悟程度暂时还没有提高的落后部分讲。不能只讲一面，而不讲另一面，更不能以感想来代替政策。政策和群众见面了，也才能使党的政策受到群众的监督，保证得到实现。把党的政策放在口袋里，以为自己知道就行了，而不向群众宣布，这是十分错误的。所以，毛泽东同志说：“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术。我们的工作犯不犯错误，其界限也在这里。”（《对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话》《毛泽东选集》第四卷）
    按照党的政策办事，必须明确任务和政策是一致的，向人民群众负责和向党的领导机关负责是一致的观点；反对那种把任务和政策对立起来，只讲任务、不讲政策的错误观点。这是完成各项任务的根本保证。党所提出的一切任务，都是根据客观形势的发展和广大群众的迫切要求提出的，一切重大任务，又都是要调动广大群众积极性才能完成。而调动广大群众积极性的根本关键，就在于通过政策去掌握群众，以正确地执行政策。党的政策愈贯彻得有力，任务也就完成得愈好。
    按照党的政策办事，还要求领导机关及时和切实地检查政策执行情况。领导的责任是出主意，用干部。所谓出主意，就是根据革命和建设的形势及群众的要求制定正确的政策；所谓用干部，就是大胆使用能正确执行政策的干部。主意出得好不好？干部用得得当不得当？就要经常地检查工作，总结经验。而检查工作，主要是检查政策执行的情况；总结经验，也主要是总结政策执行的经验。离开对政策的执行情况的检查，领导工作就在实际工作中和群众中扎不下根来。这件事是不能等闲视之的。
    一定要按照党的政策办事，归根到底，是每一个党员、每一个干部是否具有坚强的党的观念群众观念的问题。我们共产党员是觉悟的无产阶级的先锋战士，是自觉的阶级利益、阶级意志的具体代表者。政治斗争是阶级斗争的形式之一，无产阶级的思想意识，就最完全、最具体地表现在无产阶级对于当时政治斗争所采取的立场和态度上，表现在对于当前政治斗争所采取的路线、政策上。正确执行党的政策，就是我们对当前政治斗争中各种基本的重大问题所采取的立场和态度，就是和最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系，全心全意为群众服务的负责精神。我们对人民群众的这种观点，就是执行党的政策所必须具有的无产阶级群众路线的观点，我们与群众的这种关系和联系群众的方法，就是执行政策的群众路线的方法。只要我们用群众路线的观点和方法，在一切工作中坚决、正确地贯彻执行党的政策，我们就一定能够从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    （摘自上海《解放》二十期评论）
    充分发挥政策的威力
    我们知道，要办好任何事情，决定的因素是人，任何事业都是靠人做出来的，只要人的积极性和创造性发挥出来了，什么事情都好办了，毛主席教导我们说：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷）我们要大办农业，大办粮食，更是要依靠人的积极性，特别是广大农民的积极性才能办起来。但是，人的积极性怎样才能充分的发挥呢？这在于群众能够充分体会到党所提倡的事业，都是为他们自己的切身利益着想，群众才会按党的方针积极行动起来。党的政策，就是党的纲领、路线和方针的条例化。认真执行党所规定的各项政策，群众的积极性才会调动起来。我们每天做的工作，就是在执行政策。毛主席在1948年在《关于工商业政策》一文中说过，“政策是革命政党一切实际行动的出发点，并且表现于行动的过程和归宿。一个革命政党的任何行动都是实行政策。不是实行正确的政策，就是实行错误的政策；不是自觉地，就是盲目地实行某种政策。”他又说：“只有党的政策和策略全部走上正轨，中国革命才有胜利的可能。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷）所有这些都说明了党的政策的伟大威力。党的政策就是推动革命事业的动力，是实现革命既定目标的杠杆。
    要充分发挥党的政策的威力，就要贯彻执行好党的政策，要贯彻执行好党的政策，就必须提高干部贯彻执行党的政策的自觉性，而这种自觉性是建筑在对于党的每一个时期的政策的深刻理解。党在每一个革命阶段，都有总政策和具体政策，这些政策是根据一定时期社会生产力水平，群众的觉悟程度和组织程度，国家的和群众的、长远的和当前的利益等等制定出来的。我们对于党的每一项下达的政策，都应该认真地思考，仔细地研究，想一想为什么应当采取这样的政策，而不应当采取别样的政策，这个政策产生的客观背景是什么？它的基本出发点又是什么？比如在人民公社的政策规定中，确定要以队为基础，要执行按劳分配，等价交换等政策，是目前社会主义建设时期必须执行的政策。因为只有实行这些政策，才适合今天的社会生产水平和人民的觉悟程度，才有利于发展生产，为建设社会主义和向共产主义过渡创造必要的物质基础。有些同志却不了解这一点，往往错误地以我们的长远的奋斗目标，来设想当前的政策，把明天才可以执行的政策，拿来今天执行；或者强调自己的情况特殊，就不认真地执行党的政策，或者是自己以感想代替政策，乱出一套主张。结果给党的事业造成很大损害。党的现行政策，可以比作一只停在岸边的渡船，你要过河，就必须乘这只渡船到达彼岸。乘渡船是一个不可逾越的步骤。因此，我们必须经常注意明确划清每一个革命阶段的政策界限，弄清党的现行政策和党的最终目标的联系和区别。只有这样才能以正确的态度对待党的各项政策。
    要贯彻执行好党的政策，还要使各级党组织和干部认识党的政策的严肃性。坚决反对那种在对待党的政策上的无组织、无纪律行为。毛主席说过：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷）他又说：“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态，即擅自修改中央的或上级党委的政策和策略，执行他们自以为是的违背统一意志和统一纪律的极端有害的政策和策略；在工作繁忙的借口之下，采取事前不请示事后不报告的错误态度，将自己管理的地方，看成好像一个独立国，这种状态，给予革命利益的损害，极为巨大。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷）毛主席的有关政策的重要性，和执行政策上的严肃性的教导，我们每一个革命干部都应当时刻记取。在中国共产党党章第二条中把认真地执行党的政策和决议作为共产党员的义务来规定，每一个革命干部也应当是这样。应当把执行党的政策作为神圣的职责和严肃的政治任务。
    要贯彻执行好政策，还要突出地抓住发动群众这一环，党的政策再好，如果不把政策交给群众，让群众掌握，政策是不能真正贯彻执行的。群众的积极性是不会被调动起来的。所以当前要充分发动群众，让群众和干部一道来执行政策。毛主席说过，“我们的政策，不光要使领导者知道，干部知道，还要使广大的群众知道。”“马克思列宁主义的基本原则，就是要使群众认识自己的利益，并且团结起来，为自己的利益而奋斗。”“在我们一些地方的领导机关中，有的人认为，党的政策只要领导人知道就行，不需要让群众知道。这是我们的有些工作不能做好的基本原因之一。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷）只有把政策交给了并且为广大群众所接受、所掌握，才能变成巨大的物质力量。
    要向群众交政策，靠谁去交呢？靠干部去交，干部要真正把政策“交”好，首先必须自己进一步学好，转变自己的作风，深入到底，深入到小队，到作业组，到社员的家里，把政策逐项向群众讲解，让群众大放大鸣、逐项讨论，干部和群众一道，细致、具体地按照党的政策，解决一个一个的实际问题，提倡宣传一项，执行一项，贯彻一条，兑现一条。当前要抓贯彻执行政策，就必须首先抓干部作风。只有干部的作风更加深入了，才能够依靠群众，发动群众，把政策贯彻执行到底。
