Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 6th: Shijiazhuang area, Hebei Province, has implemented a management system of "planned supply, quota contracting" for coking coal and coke in various coking plants and iron smelting plants, which has further mobilized the enthusiasm of workers to increase production and conserve resources. The consumption of coking coal and coke in various factories has generally decreased, and the output and quality of coke and pig iron have been increasing steadily. From September 1st to 20th, the average coke consumption per ton of iron in various factories decreased by 178 kilograms; the coke coking rate increased from 77.41% in August to 80%. The amount of coking coal consumed per ton of coke decreased by 74 kilograms. The quality of coke and pig iron has greatly improved.

The specific methods of the "planned supply, quota contracting" management implemented by various coking plants and iron smelting plants in the Shijiazhuang area are: the city stipulates quota targets based on the amount of coal consumed per ton of coke and the amount of coke consumed per ton of iron by each coking and iron smelting enterprise. After mass discussions, each factory then implements the coal and coke consumption quotas and the output of pig iron and coke that should be produced with these coal and coke to the workshops and coke ovens and blast furnaces. In this way, a concrete production increase and conservation plan of using less coal to produce more coke and using less coke to produce more iron is formed from the city to the factory and to the furnace. In the implementation of this plan, the principle of "quota contracting, guaranteed supply, rewarding the advanced, and checking waste" is implemented. When the actual consumption of each factory in production is lower than the quota, the saved coking coal or coke is used by the unit to increase production; if coal and coke are wasted, responsibility must be investigated. This is a major reform in the coal and coke supply work in Shijiazhuang, and an effective measure to ensure increased steel production.

After the implementation of this management system in various coking plants and iron smelting plants in this area, the production enthusiasm of the workers has been further mobilized. Various factories have tried their best to increase the coking rate and reduce the pig iron coke ratio, so that they can use less coal to produce more coke and use less coke to produce more iron. In the process of promoting this system, iron factories and coking plants in Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant, Zhengding, and Yuanshi have extensively mobilized the masses and formulated consumption quotas and specific measures for all links, from raw coal entering the factory, coal washing, entering the furnace for coking, exiting the furnace, handling, crushing, and iron smelting. The workers in each link of the factory have clear goals to strive for. After the workers in the crushing process of the Yuanshi Iron Smelting Plant formulated the quota target of reducing the crushing loss rate to below 10%, they thoroughly investigated loopholes and tapped potential, changed the past operation methods of padding coke and smashing coke when crushing coke, resulting in much dross and large losses, and changed the flat hammer used for smashing coke into a small pointed hammer, and laid bricks during crushing. As a result, the coke loss rate generally dropped from 15% to below 10%, and the particle size was qualified. After Zhengding Coking Plant implemented "quota contracting" by person, the coke crushing finished product rate in the first half of September increased from 63.5% in August to 85%.

In order to ensure the smooth implementation of this method, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, a leading group for conserving coal and coke was established on the metallurgical front. From the factory to the workshop, each factory was led by the secretary or factory director to specifically lead this work. At the same time, the Municipal Party Committee and various factories also dispatched a large number of cadres to the blast furnaces and coke ovens to participate in labor, and to help grassroots cadres and workers investigate loopholes, tap potential, make detailed accounts, and formulate advanced consumption quotas and measures to reduce consumption quotas.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 6th: The Ji'an Iron and Steel Plant in Jiangxi has launched a collaborative competition among the coking, transportation, crushing, and smelting sections, with the content of reducing the coke ratio, and the coke ratio has been decreasing step by step. Recently, the coke consumption per ton of iron has dropped to 0.8 tons, a decrease of 0.84 tons compared to July.

In the collaborative competition, the four sections of coking, transportation, crushing, and smelting have formulated five measures respectively, doing their best in saving coke, closely cooperating, and reducing the coke ratio. In the past, the workers of the No. 6 blast furnace of the smelting section, in order to maintain the furnace temperature and increase production, would only load coke and not load ore when the furnace hearth temperature dropped. After launching the collaborative competition, the workers changed to using methods such as injecting marble into the slag outlet and lowering some pig iron at the top of the furnace to treat the problem of low furnace hearth temperature, and adopted the operating technology of large wind, high temperature, and fine materials to try their best to increase pig iron production and reduce the coke ratio. After adopting the above methods, the utilization coefficient of this blast furnace increased from 1.35 in August to 1.87, and the coke ratio decreased from 1.2 tons in August to 0.8 tons, becoming a blast furnace in the entire factory that has both high output and relatively low consumption. In the competition, the workers of the coking section insisted that raw coke, chemical coke, carbon heads, crushed coke, and coke exceeding the ash powder index should not leave the factory, providing good conditions for the transportation, crushing, and smelting sections. In order to closely cooperate with the coking and crushing sections, the transportation section gently handles, loads, unloads, transports, and unloads during transportation, and tries its best to reduce the phenomenon of coke being crushed and wasted during transportation. The coking section is 120 miles away from the smelting section. In the past, coke was often crushed when loading onto ships. Now, the workers in the transportation section have padded the ships with straw, and the coke falls on the soft straw and is no longer crushed, thus reducing 15% of waste.

    促进焦厂铁厂节约使用原煤焦炭
    石家庄实行煤焦定额管理
    吉安钢铁厂各工段开展协作竞赛焦比步步下降
    据新华社天津6日电　河北省石家庄地区各炼焦厂、炼铁厂实行焦煤、焦炭“计划供应、定额包干”的管理制度，进一步调动了各厂职工增产节约积极性。各厂焦煤、焦炭的消耗量普遍下降，焦炭和生铁的产量质量节节上升。9月1日至20日，各厂平均每吨铁耗焦量降低了一百七十八公斤；焦炭结焦率由8月份的77.41％提高到80％。每吨焦消耗的焦煤量降低了七十四公斤。焦炭、生铁质量都有很大提高。
    石家庄地区各炼焦厂、炼铁厂实行焦煤、焦炭“计划供应、定额包干”管理的具体作法是：根据各炼焦、炼铁企业每吨焦的耗煤量和每吨铁的耗焦量，由市规定定额指标。各厂经过群众讨论，再把煤、焦消耗定额和用这些煤、焦应产的生铁、焦炭产量落实到车间和焦炉、高炉。这样从市到厂、到炉，就形成了一个具体的少用煤多炼焦、少用焦多炼铁的增产节约计划。在执行这个计划中，贯彻“定额包干，保证供应，奖励先进，检查浪费”的原则。各工厂在生产中实际消耗低于定额时，节约的焦煤或焦炭归本单位用来增产；如果浪费了煤焦，就要检查责任。这是石家庄市煤焦供应工作的一项重大改革，是保证钢铁增产的一项有效措施。
    这个地区各炼焦厂、炼铁厂实行这一管理制度以后，进一步调动了职工群众的生产积极性。各厂千方百计地提高结焦率，降低生铁焦比，做到了少用煤多炼焦，少用焦多炼铁。石家庄市钢铁厂，正定、元氏的铁厂和焦厂在推行这一制度中，广泛发动群众，从原煤进厂、洗煤、入炉炼焦、出炉、搬运、粉碎以及炼铁等各个环节，都订出消耗定额和具体措施，全厂每一个环节上的职工都有明确的奋斗目标。元氏炼铁厂粉碎工序职工，在订出把粉碎耗损率降低到10％以下的定额指标后，大查漏洞挖潜力，改变了过去粉碎焦炭时垫焦砸焦出末多损耗大的操作方法，并把砸焦用的平锤改成小尖锤，粉碎时铺上砖，结果焦炭损耗率普遍由15％降到10％以下，并且作到了粒度合格。正定炼焦厂按人实行“定额包干”后，9月上半月焦炭粉碎成品率由8月的63.5％提高到85％。
    为了保证这一办法的顺利实行，在市委领导下，冶炼战线成立了节约煤焦领导小组。各厂从厂到车间也都由书记或厂长挂帅具体领导这一工作。同时市委和各厂还抽调了大批干部分别到各高炉、焦炉，一面参加劳动，一面帮助基层干部和职工查漏洞，挖潜力，算细账，制订先进的消耗定额和降低消耗定额的措施。
    新华社南昌6日电　江西吉安钢铁厂炼焦、运输、破碎、冶炼各个工段之间，以降低焦比为内容开展协作竞赛，焦比步步下降。最近每吨铁的耗焦量下降到零点八吨，比7月份降低了零点八四吨。
    在协作竞赛中，炼焦、运输、破碎、冶炼四个工段分别订出了五条措施，在节约焦炭中各尽所能，紧密协作，降低焦比。冶炼工段六号高炉的职工，过去为了保持炉温，提高产量，每逢炉缸温度降低时，便在装料时光下焦炭，不装矿石；开展协作竞赛后，职工们改用渣口注入云石、炉顶下些生铁的办法来治理炉缸低温的毛病，并采取大风、高温、精料的操作技术，尽力提高生铁产量，降低焦比。这座高炉采取上述办法后，利用系数由8月份的1.35上升到1.87，焦比由8月份的一点二吨下降到零点八吨，成了全厂既高产消耗又较低的一个高炉。炼焦工段的职工在竞赛中，坚持生焦、化焦、炭头、碎焦和超过灰粉指标的焦不出厂，为运输、破碎、冶炼工段提供了良好条件。运输工段为了和炼焦、破碎工段紧密协作，在运输中轻拿、轻装、轻放、轻运、轻卸，在运输中尽力减少碰碎浪费焦炭的现象。炼焦工段离冶炼工段有一百二十里，过去焦炭在装船时，经常被碰碎。现在运输工段的职工在船上垫上了稻草，焦炭落在柔软的稻草上，不再被碰碎了，因此就减少了15％的浪费。
