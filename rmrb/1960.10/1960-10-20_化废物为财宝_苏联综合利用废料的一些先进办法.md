Turning Waste into Treasure
Advanced Soviet Methods for Comprehensive Utilization of Waste Materials

    Artificial Fiber Plant Waste Products Replace Metal
    The Uritzky Factory in Engels, Saratov Oblast, successfully experimented with using waste from an artificial fiber plant to manufacture parts for trolleybuses, saving the country a large amount of non-ferrous metals and steel, simplifying production processes, and reducing costs.
    They are utilizing the waste materials from the neighboring Engels Artificial and Synthetic Fiber Plant. Currently, each "GiU-5" trolleybus produced by this factory contains thirty types of parts, totaling one hundred and fifty pieces, made from these waste materials. These Kapron parts, made from waste materials, previously had to be manufactured using aluminum, bronze, steel, or cast iron. Because these Kapron parts can be cast in a mold in one go, without the need for machining, the labor required for the production process is reduced by nine-tenths compared to before. The cost has also been reduced by approximately half.

    Petroleum Waste Made into Growth Stimulant
    Azerbaijani agricultural chemist Guseinov extracted a new stimulant promoting the growth of animals and plants from petroleum waste.
    Large-scale experiments at the Baku Poultry Farm showed that chickens fed this stimulant daily gained 20% more weight after two months than those not fed the stimulant, and the egg production rate also increased by nearly 20%. Large-scale experiments at silkworm farms resulted in a 12% to 17% increase in cocoon yield. Laboratory tests have shown that it can also promote the growth of rabbits, sheep, and cattle.
    Guseinov's preparation was initially used to stimulate plant growth. It has shown good results on cotton and some vegetable crops.
    This preparation is obtained by treating petroleum waste with caustic alkali solution. The production method is simple and the cost is low. In terms of its nature, it is very similar to active biological substances such as hormones and vitamins. Unlike penicillin, streptomycin, and other antibiotics, it does not reduce the body's antibacterial resistance.

    Extracting Edible Dyes from Grape Pomace
    A group of experts in Moldova has developed a method for extracting edible dyes from grape pomace after processing. This dye can be used in the food industry as a substitute for blue-light acidic red, and it can also give food a grape juice-like flavor.
    This dye is a paste-like extract containing organic acids, pectin, tannins, aromatics, and other valuable substances.
    Moldova will organize the industrial production of natural edible dyes from grape pomace in five factories this year.

    Alcohol Factory Waste Turns into Vitamin D
    The Lokhvitsa Alcohol Factory has used waste from the alcohol industry to produce feed-grade Vitamin D in the form of dried yeast. Its cost is only one-third of the currently used Vitamin D, while the vitamin content per unit is ten times higher than the latter.
    Scientists have pointed out that this yeast vitamin has high stability and will not be destroyed when mixed into feed. Even using a very small dose, such as adding fifty grams of yeast per ton of feed, is enough to prevent rickets in young livestock and poultry, and increase their average weight gain rate by 10%.

    Microorganisms Regenerate Used Film
    The Institute of Microbiology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences recently succeeded in using microorganisms to treat used movie film, enabling the reuse of old movie film that has already been screened and the negatives of waste film. A semi-industrialized facility for mass cultivation of these microorganisms has been put into production in Ukraine.
    Ordinary movie film can only go through one production cycle. The negatives of old films that are no longer screened after multiple screenings are usually discarded. And when filming, only a portion of the film taken during the entire filming process is actually shown on the screen, and the other discarded film cannot be reused. Scientists have experimented with using alkalis and acids to treat these waste films, removing the photosensitive emulsion on the film. However, alkalis can damage the negatives; acids can damage equipment, neither are suitable.
    Scientists at the Institute of Microbiology, when studying the use of enzymes made from Bacillus mesentericus to treat waste film, found that the already exposed emulsion on the film can be completely removed in just fifteen minutes, without damaging the structure of the negative.
    Bacillus mesentericus is a widely distributed bacterium. It is easy to culture this bacterium using waste products from many industrial productions and natural microbial culture media.
    Soviet scientists use a sealed device to culture Bacillus mesentericus, which enables the surface and interior of the culture medium to simultaneously produce a large amount of this bacterium, greatly accelerating the process of enzyme production.

    化废物为财宝
    苏联综合利用废料的一些先进办法
    人造纤维厂废料制品代替金属
    萨拉托夫州恩格斯城乌里次基工厂试验用人造纤维厂的下脚料制造一些无轨电车零件成功，为国家节约了大量有色金属和钢铁，简化了生产工序，降低了成本。
    他们利用的是邻近的恩格斯城人造和合成纤维厂的下脚料。现在这个厂出品的“吉乌—五”型无轨电车中每一辆上有三十种共一百五十件零件是用这些下脚料制成的。而这些用下脚料制成的卡普隆零件，过去都要用铝、青铜、钢或铸铁制造。由于这些卡普隆零件可以在压模中一次铸成，无须经过机械加工，制作过程所耗的劳动较前减少了十分之九。成本也差不多降低了一半左右。
    石油下脚料制成生长刺激素
    阿塞拜疆农业化学家古谢伊诺夫从石油下脚料中提取出一种促进动植物生长的新的刺激素。
    巴库饲禽场大规模试验表明，每天加喂这种刺激素的鸡两月以后体重增加额，比没有加喂的多20％，而产卵率也差不多增加了20％。在养蚕场大规模试验结果，可使出茧率增加12％到17％。实验室试验表明，它也可以促进兔、羊、牛的生长。
    古谢伊诺夫制剂起先是用来刺激植物生长的。它对棉花和一些菜蔬作物效果良好。
    这种制剂是用苛性碱溶液处理石油下脚料获得的。制作方法简便，成本低廉。就其性质看，很类似荷尔蒙和维生素一类活泼的生物质。与青霉素、生霉素和其它抗菌素不同，它不会降低机体的抗菌力。
    从葡萄渣中提取食用染料
    摩尔达维亚一批专家研究出了从葡萄加工后的渣滓中提取食用染料的方法。这种染料可以在食品工业中用作蓝光酸性红的代用品，而它同时又可以使食品具有葡萄汁一样的香味。
    这种染料是一种糊膏状提出物，它还含有有机酸、果胶、鞣酸、芳香物和其它珍贵物质。
    摩尔达维亚今年即将在五个工厂中组织从葡萄渣中提取天然食用染料的工业性生产。
    酒精厂下脚料变丁种维生素
    洛赫维次酒精工厂利用酒精工业下脚料制成了干酵母形式的饲用丁种维生素。它的成本仅为目前使用的丁种维生素的三分之一，而同一单位中的维生素含量却比后者多十倍。
    科学家们指出，这种酵母维生素具有高度的稳定性，在搅拌到饲料中去的时候不会遭到破坏。即使使用极小的剂量，例如每吨饲料中加入五十克酵母，就足以使幼畜和幼禽不得软骨病，使它们体重增长率平均提高10％。
    微生物使废旧胶卷再生
    苏联科学院微生物学研究所最近研究用微生物处理已用过的电影胶卷获得成功，使已放映过的旧电影胶卷和废胶卷的底片可以反复使用。一个大量培养这种微生物的半工业化设备已经在乌克兰投入生产。
    一般的电影胶卷只能经过一次生产周期。经过多次放映后不再放映的旧影片的底片通常弃置不用。而在拍摄影片时，真正在银幕上映出的只是在整个拍摄过程中摄取的胶卷的一部分，其他作废的胶卷也就不能再用。科学家曾经试验用碱和酸来处理这些废旧电影胶卷，去除胶片上的感光乳胶。但是碱会使底片受损；酸又会破坏器械设备，都不适用。
    微生物学研究所的科学家研究用马铃薯杆菌制成的酵素来处理废旧胶卷时，只要十五分钟就能把胶片上的已经感过光的乳胶完全去掉，而对底片的结构又没有损伤。
    马铃薯杆菌是一种散布很广的细菌。利用许多种工业生产的废品和自然的微生物培养基就能很容易培养这种细菌。
    苏联科学家用密封装置来培养马铃薯杆菌，能使培养基的表面和内部同时大量产生这种细菌，大大加速产生酵素的过程。
