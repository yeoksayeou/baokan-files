	Every Grain to the Granary, Not a Leaf or Twig to be Discarded
	Jilin Jiaohe County Xingfu Zhilu (Road to Happiness) People's Commune Communications Group

	Just after the Autumn Equinox, an early frost heralded the beginning of the autumn harvest. On the 5,700-plus hectares of land in the Xingfu Zhilu People's Commune in Jilin's Jiaohe County, commune members braved the autumn cold, wielding their sickles and engaging in a battle with the elements to secure the grain.

	The sun swept away the white frost, and the earth was bathed in gold. In the basin centered on Xin Zhan (New Station), over 1,300 hectares of rice paddies rippled; on the surrounding undulating slopes, over 2,000 hectares of corn forests stretched; and nestled between the rice paddies and millet forests were 1,200 hectares of "Full Granary Gold" soybeans… All the grains were ripe. These crops, accounting for 90% of the total cultivated area, awaited harvesting.

	In this region, with its vast land, sparse population, and single annual harvest, untimely harvests in previous years often resulted in "digging for grain in the snow and threshing on ice," leading to significant grain losses! This year, the commune expanded its cultivated land by over 900 hectares, and the density of crops also increased, resulting in a harvest greater than any previous year. However, the labor force was reduced by more than 300 people compared to last year, and heavy snow was expected before the end of October. To seize time was to seize grain; an early harvest meant a greater harvest. How could the entire crop be brought in before the heavy snow? This was a matter of great concern to everyone.

	Thousands of Troops Busy Harvesting

	The Party's policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production inspired the people's soaring enthusiasm for seizing grain and ensuring a good harvest. More than 3,800 able-bodied laborers rapidly surged to the front lines, engaging in fierce competitions between teams, groups, and individuals. Elderly people, even those over sixty, eagerly participated in the labor, contributing their strength to harvest a few more ears of corn. Those remaining in logistical support positions took on multiple roles, ensuring the autumn harvest army had no "worries behind them." More than 4,000 young people mobilized together, carrying baskets and carefully gleaning rice ears. More than 200 cadres dispatched by the commune and district levels, as well as employees of commune-run industries, had already arrived in the production teams. Thousands of troops from towns and cities arrived in succession to provide support. The autumn harvest wave surged thousands of feet high, rising daily. During the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays, red flags fluttered in the fields. The autumn harvest campaign, involving 40% of the commune's population, proceeded day and night in shifts.

	This was a meticulously organized battle. The Weitang Production Team offered a glimpse into the overall picture of the commune. This production team, consisting of 200 people, had a labor force of one-quarter of its population. Only 31 people were originally on the front lines of production, but they had to harvest 75 hectares of crops. Under these circumstances, as the commune members put it, they would "meet the heavy snow face to face." The Party branch decided to fully mobilize the masses, holding meetings for cadres, the masses, model workers, women, the elderly, cooks, and livestock keepers, one after another. The potential for the autumn harvest seemed to gush forth like a spring. Thirteen laborers were transferred from orchards, vegetable gardens, nurseries, sewing groups, and livestock farms. Eighteen older commune members and twenty-seven students participated in auxiliary autumn harvest labor. The manpower on the front line of the autumn harvest surged to 89 people, accounting for 44.5% of the team's population, and 88% of the total labor force.

	Now that the potential had been tapped, how could it be arranged to maximize efficiency? The team committee assigned different tasks based on the varying intensity of the work and the age, physical strength, and skills of the commune members. During the day, in the rice paddies far from the village, the "Wu Song Group," composed of young and strong laborers, was racing to harvest the cost-work rice. The "Huang Zhong Group" of elderly farmers was harvesting the difficult-to-harvest millet and soybeans on the hills. The women of the "Eight Diamond Aunts Group" and the "March 8th Red Banner Group" were either harvesting corn or husking corn cobs. In the fields near the village and next to the corn lofts, the "Evergreen Group" of elderly and infirm commune members chatted and laughed as they peeled the husks from the corn cobs. Children sang songs, skipping and hopping as they gleaned rice ears and potatoes. In the evening, only the rustling of sickles could be heard in the rice paddies. Young women gathered around the lights of the canteen, husking corn, while the elderly and children rested early. The busy autumn harvest work was arranged in an orderly manner, ensuring that everyone could use their talents, work with appropriate rest. From the start of the harvest on September 26th to October 10th, in half a month, all the crops in the team had been harvested and gleaned.

	During these days, on the fields of the commune's seventy-four production teams, one could see autumn harvest scenes as heated, intense, and practical as those in Weitang. The Xidagujiazi Production Team assigned autumn harvest tasks to the paddy field group, dry land group, and women's group based on plots of land, and each group set quotas for first, second, and third-class laborers for land to be harvested. On the day before National Day, despite the drizzling rain, more than 70 male and female commune members persisted in completing their daily quota for land to be harvested before stopping work. The "May Fourth" Youth Rocket Team launched a very thorough autumn harvest competition, with moving stories of husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, sisters-in-law competing to be the first. The young "quick-knife hands" chased each other, increasing the progress of each person's daily harvest of 1.2 or 1.3 mu of rice to 2.1 or 2.2 mu.

	Every Grain of Pearl is Secured

	In the heated atmosphere of rapid harvesting, a strong light gleamed: the slogan "meticulous harvesting, every grain to the granary" was spreading everywhere. A mass movement for meticulous harvesting and gleaning quickly expanded to every corner of the commune. On the day the Bao'an Production Team started harvesting, Han En, a national model worker who was competing in meticulous and rapid harvesting with a group of young rice harvesters, constantly squatted down and stood up. He was meticulously harvesting the fallen rice. In the field behind him, even in uneven places, no rice stubble higher than half an inch could be seen, and not a single rice ear could be found. Like him, his young opponents preferred to work a little harder themselves rather than lose a single rice ear, carefully using the tip of the sickle to hook up any rice stalks that had accidentally fallen on the ground. Zheng Ruizhen, a middle school student who was harvesting rice for the first time, was clumsy and anxious, and left an unharvested rice stalk. Han En immediately stopped and personally taught her how to grasp the rice stalks and how to hold the sickle. During the break, Han En spoke to the young people about the significance of meticulous harvesting: "We've worked hard for a spring and a summer, and we must cherish the fruits of our labor. In a bountiful region like ours, we must harvest even more carefully this year and harvest more grain to support our compatriots in the disaster areas." Han En's words expressed the sentiments of the vast majority of commune members. Under the leadership of the cadres, they were changing their past habits of rough harvesting and coming up with many new methods of meticulous harvesting and gleaning. Each production team established quality inspection groups. Yu Yongxing, the 62-year-old captain of the Dadianzi Production Team, first harvested a piece of "quality standard field" in front of the team members as a "model" for the team's quality acceptance. The commune members of the Qiangtongxin Production Team always dispersed and walked through the harvested fields when going to and leaving work, checking each other's quality while picking up any fallen rice ears.

	The actions of the support army in cherishing grain were praised by the commune members. More than 200 students, brought by the Party Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Workers and Peasants Cadre School, consulted with skilled rice harvesters as soon as they arrived in the fields and harvested diligently according to the production team's quality "model." The students of Henan Elementary School, a red banner in supporting agriculture, practiced harvesting in their school's 7.5 mu of rice fields before setting off to support the production team in harvesting rice.

	The commune-wide grain-gleaning movement was launched immediately afterward. The grain-gleaning team, composed of all the primary school students, worked hard to guard the last pass of the harvest, with more than 8,000 sharp eyes searching everywhere for dropped rice ears. Liu Ren, a primary school student in Yangyucun, picked up the rice grains that had been knocked to the ground by hail some days ago when he could not find any rice ears to glean.

	In order to eliminate the harm from sparrows, birds, beasts, and livestock, the big cart team members rushed to transport the crops that had been felled on the mountains, forest edges, roadsides, and village edges first. They used newly woven straw mats to line the bottom of the carts, and loaded and unloaded them gently to prevent the grain from being shaken off.

	Every Grass and Leaf is Collected

	In the past, during the autumn harvest, roaring fires were often lit in the fields and next to the threshing grounds. Farmers would thresh the grain while adding freshly threshed straw to the fire to keep warm. In people's eyes, grass seemed to be worthless. After liberation, the phenomenon of burning grass disappeared, but the rice stubble in the fields was still left high. When asked why, the answer was that the grass could fertilize the fields. Here, corn stalks were always underestimated, so that many corn stalks rotted in the fields every year.

	This year, "not a leaf or twig to be discarded" has become a resounding slogan. The task of collecting an extra 1,000 jin of grass per hectare and bringing back all the corn stalks was presented to the commune members. However, long-standing habits needed to be changed, starting with the mind. At the beginning of the autumn harvest, the slogan "collect every inch of grass" was raised. On the thousand-mu high-yield plot near Xinzhan, Zhang Longfeng, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, after demonstrating cutting close to the ground, posed a question to the commune members: "How much is an inch of grass worth?" He led the commune members to calculate: cutting one more inch could yield eight liang of grass per bundle of rice; if each person cut 130 bundles of rice per day, they could collect an extra 100 jin of grass. At two cents per jin of grass, each person could create an extra two yuan of wealth for the commune each day. One hectare of rice field could produce more than 1,400 bundles of grass, and cutting one more inch could yield more than 1,000 jin. The whole commune could collect an extra 1.3 million jin of rice straw this year, generating an extra income of 26,000 yuan. Zhang Longfeng concluded: "You see, one more inch and one less inch are very much related to our socialist life!" The calculation made everything clear to the commune members. They said: "As long as we put the sickle a little flatter, collecting an extra 1,000 jin of grass per hectare won't take much effort." The calculation was immediately transmitted from the telephone conference to all management areas and production teams.

	Next, Secretary Zhang successfully experimented with extracting starch from corn husks in the Sixth Production Team of Xinzhan. When the secretaries of each management area and the mess hall managers tasted the dry food made by mixing this starch with grain, a mass movement to collect corn husks formed throughout the commune. In the past, people would break off the corn cobs in the fields and throw away the husks at will; now they broke off both the cobs and the husks together and brought them back to the village, carefully bundling the husks in preparation for air-drying and centralized storage. All the production teams in the Beian Management Area also built large grass pens to store corn husks and rice straw.

	In this mountainous area of Northeast China, although the temperature is constantly decreasing, the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy, centered on the autumn harvest, is rising wave upon wave. As harvesting is just nearing its end, threshing and delivering public grain have already begun. The slogans of meticulous threshing, meticulous management, and meticulous use are spreading their wings, flying from one village to another.

    颗粒归仓　枝叶不丢
    吉林蛟河县幸福之路人民公社通讯组
    秋分刚过，一场早霜揭开了秋收的序幕。在吉林蛟河县幸福之路人民公社五千七百多公顷土地上，社员们冒着秋寒挥镰上阵，展开了与天争粮的战斗。
    太阳扫去了白霜，大地一片金色。在以新站为中心的盆地上，荡漾着一千三百多公顷稻浪；在四周起伏的岗坡上，蔓延着二千多公顷玉米林；在稻海黍林之间，还有一千二百公顷“满仓金”的大豆……，五谷都成熟了。这些占全部耕作面积90％的庄稼，都在等待人们收割。
    在这个地多人少、一年一熟的地区，往年由于收获不及时，常常是“雪里扒粮、冰上打场”，粮食耗损相当惊人！今年，全公社耕地扩大了九百多公顷，作物密植程度也增加了，收获量比哪一年都大；但是劳动力却比去年减少了三百多名，而且不出10月，大雪就要来临了。抢时间就是抢粮食，早收才能多收。如何抢在大雪之先，把全部庄稼收到手里？人们都在关心这件事。
    千军万马忙收秋
    党提出的大办农业、大办粮食的方针，鼓起了人们夺粮保收的冲天干劲。三千八百多名精壮劳动力迅速涌上第一线，展开了队队、组组、人人之间的对手赛；年逾花甲的老人们争着参加劳动，为多掰一两个玉米而贡献自己的力量；留在后勤岗位上的人，有的一身兼数“员”，全力保证秋收大军无“后顾之忧”；四千多名青少年一齐出动，提篮携筐细心拣拾稻穗；社、区两级下派干部和社办工业职工二百多人早就来到了生产队里；数以千计的城镇支援大军陆续赶来。秋收巨浪一涌千丈，日日高涨。国庆和中秋两个佳节，田间红旗招展，由全公社40％的人口参加的秋收大会战，夜以继日轮番地进行着。
    这是一场精心组织的战斗。从苇塘生产队可以看到全公社的缩影。这个由二百口人组成的生产队，劳动力占四分之一，原在生产第一线的只有三十一人，要收割的庄稼却有七十五公顷。在这种情况下，用社员的话说，“就会同大雪照面”。党支部决定充分动员群众，干部会、群众会、标兵会、妇女会、老年会、炊事员会、饲养员会一个接一个地开起来，秋收的潜力好像喷泉一样涌出来。十三个劳动力从果园、菜地、托儿所、缝纫组和饲养场中调换出来，十八位老社员和二十七名学生参加了秋收辅助劳动。秋收第一线的人力猛增到八十九人，占全队人口的44.5％，其中劳动力占总劳动力的88％。
    潜力挖掘出来了，如何安排好，能充分发挥最大的工效呢？队委会按各种活路的轻重以及社员的年龄、体力和技能，分配了不同的任务。白天，远离村子的稻田里，由青壮年组成的“武松组”，在抢收费工的水稻；“黄忠组”的老农们，在山岗上收割难收的谷子和大豆；“金刚八大娘组”和“三八红旗组”的妇女们，有些人在收割玉米，有些人在掰玉米棒。在村庄附近的地里和玉米楼子旁边，“不老松组”的老弱社员，一边谈笑，一边剥去玉米的包叶；儿童们唱着歌，跳跳蹦蹦地在拣稻穗和土豆。傍晚，只有稻田里还传出沙沙的镰刀声，食堂的灯光下还围坐着一群搓玉米的青年妇女，老年人和孩子们都早早安憩了。大忙的秋收工作被安排得井井有条，做到了人尽其才、有劳有逸。从9月26日开镰，到10月10日的半个月中，全队的庄稼就已割净拣净。
    这些日子，在全公社七十四个生产队的田野上，都可以看到像苇塘那样热烈紧张而又踏踏实实的秋收场面。西大姑家子生产队把秋收任务按地块分别落实到水田组、旱田组和妇女组，每一个组又为一、二、三等劳动力规定了割地定额。国庆前一天，虽然秋雨绵绵，七十多名男女社员一直坚持完成当天割地定额才收工。“五四”青年火箭队的秋收对手赛发动得非常深入，出现了夫妻、兄弟、姊妹、姑嫂互相争先的动人事迹，青年“快刀手”们你追我赶，把每人日割一亩二、三分水稻的进度提高到二亩一、二分。
    粒粒珍珠拿到手
    快收快割的热烈气氛中，闪动着一道强烈的光亮，那就是到处传播的“精打细收、颗粒归仓”的口号。一个细割细拣的群众运动，很快就扩展到了公社每个角落。保安生产队开镰那天，同一群青年割稻能手展开细收快收赛的全国劳动模范韩恩，不断地蹲下去又立起来。他正在细细收割倒伏的稻子。在他身后的地里，哪怕是凹凸不平的地方，看不到高过半寸的稻槎，拣不到一个稻穗。他的青年对手同他一样，都宁可自己多受一点累，也不让一个稻穗丢掉，细心地用镰尖把偶而丢在地上的稻棵勾起来。青年姑娘郑瑞珍，这个第一次割稻的中学生，手生心急，留下了一棵未割净的稻子。韩恩立即停下来，亲手教给她怎样抓稻把，怎样搂镰刀。歇气的时候，韩恩向青年们谈起细收细割的意义：“忙了一春、一夏，劳动果实一定要爱惜。像咱们这个丰收地区，今年更要收得细一些，好多收一些粮食支援灾区同胞。”韩恩的话道出了广大社员的心意。他们在干部的带动下，改变着过去粗收的习惯，想出了许多新的细割细拣的方法，各个生产队都成立了质量检查小组。大甸子生产队六十二岁的于永兴队长，先在队员们面前割出了一片“质量标准田”，作为全队质量验收的“样板”。前同心生产队的社员们，出工和收工的时候，总要分散开从收割过的地里走过，一面互相检查质量，一面顺手拣起遗落的稻穗。
    支援大军珍惜粮食的行动受到了社员们的赞扬。由吉林省工农干部学校党委书记亲自带来的二百多名学员，一到田间，就向割稻能手请教，并按照生产队的质量“样板”认真收割。支援农业的一面红旗——河南小学的学生们，先在自己学校的七亩半稻田里练习收割，然后再出发支援生产队割稻子。
    全公社的拣粮运动，紧接着开展了起来。由全体小学生组成的拣粮队伍，努力把守着收割的最后一关，八千多只锐利的眼睛到处寻觅着丢落的稻穗。养鱼屯的小学生刘仁，在拣不到稻穗的时候，就把前些日子被冰雹打落在地下的稻粒拾起来。
    为了免除雀、禽、兽、畜的危害，大车队员们，尽先把山上、林边、路边、屯边割倒的庄稼抢运回来。他们用新编的草帘铺垫在车底上，轻轻地装卸，防止震落粮食。
    一草一叶收回来
    以往秋收时，在田间的场园旁，常常燃起了熊熊的大火，农民们一边打场，一边把刚脱谷的稻草添在火堆中，烧火取暖。在人们眼中，草似乎是不值钱的东西。解放后，烧草的现象没有了，但田里的稻槎还留得高高的。问起原因来，回答是草可以肥田。在这里，对玉米秸，总不够重视，以致每年有不少玉米秸腐烂在地里。
    今年秋收，“枝叶不丢”已经成为响亮的口号。每公顷地多收一千斤草和把全部玉米秸收回家的任务提到了社员们的面前。可是，多年的老习惯需要首先从思想上来改变。秋收一开始，“多收一寸草”的口号就提了出来。在新站附近的千亩丰产方上，公社党委第一书记张隆峰作完了贴地皮下刀的示范，又向社员群众提出一个问题：“一寸草能值多少钱？”他领导社员算了一笔账：多割一寸，一捆稻子就可以多收八两草；每人一天割一百三十捆稻子，就可以多收一百斤草。每斤草值二分钱，一人一天就可以多为公社创造两块钱的财富。一公顷稻田可以产一千四百多捆草，多割一寸，就可以多得一千多斤。全公社今年可以多收一百三十万斤稻草，多收入二万六千多元。张隆峰最后归结说：“你们看，多一寸和少一寸，都和咱们过社会主义日子有很大的关系啊！”一笔账算得社员心都明白过来。他们说：“只要把镰刀稍微放平些，每公顷地多收一千斤草，是用不着费多大力气的。”这笔账立即从电话会议上传到了各个管理区、各个生产队。
    接着，张书记在新站第六生产队，又试验成功了从玉米包叶里提取淀粉。当各管理区的书记和伙食管理员尝到了用这种淀粉掺和粮食制成的干粮以后，全公社收集玉米包叶就形成了群众运动。过去，人们在地里掰下玉米棒，随手就扔掉了包叶；现在连棒连包叶一齐掰回村里，并细心地把包叶捆扎起来，准备风干集中保藏。北安管理区所有生产队还建起了大草栏，存放玉米包叶和稻草。
    在这东北的山区，气温虽在不断下降，以秋收为中心的群众性增产节约运动却在一浪高过一浪。收割刚刚接近尾声，打场脱粒和送缴公粮的活动又已展开，细打、细管、细用的口号，正展开翅膀，从这个村庄飞到另一个村庄。
