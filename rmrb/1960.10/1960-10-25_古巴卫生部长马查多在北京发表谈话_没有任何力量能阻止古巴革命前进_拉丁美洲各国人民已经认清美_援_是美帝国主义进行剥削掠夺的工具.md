Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: Cuban Minister of Health, José Ramón Machado Ventura, speaking to Xinhua reporters before leaving China, strongly condemned the economic blockade imposed on Cuba by U.S. imperialism. He emphasized, "The Cuban people know how to resist, and they will give U.S. imperialism a new and heavy blow. The Cuban revolution will advance, and no force can stop us."

Machado pointed out that this new act of aggression by U.S. imperialism is one of the vile means preceding its military intervention in Cuba. He vehemently criticized the activities carried out by U.S. imperialism against the Cuban people since the victory of the Cuban revolution. He particularly noted that U.S. imperialism shelters and supports Cuban war criminals who have fled Cuba, provides them with bases for carrying out counter-revolutionary activities, allowing them to send planes from the United States to bomb Cuban sugarcane fields and cities; in addition, it constantly supplies Cuban counter-revolutionaries with dollars and weapons. In short, the United States is trying to create a movement against Cuba through various means.

Machado said, "The purpose of U.S. imperialism is to strangle the Cuban revolution as soon as possible in order to eliminate the example of struggle set by the Cuban revolution for the peoples of Latin American countries." He said that the peoples of Latin American countries, who have been subjected to the cruel exploitation and oppression of U.S. imperialism in the past and present, hope to follow in Cuba's footsteps and strive for freedom and complete independence.

Professor José López Sánchez, a member of the Cuban health delegation who received the agency's reporters along with Minister Machado, said, "The economic blockade imposed on Cuba by U.S. imperialism not only fails to show its 'strength,' but also demonstrates its weakness. The United States has taken this measure also because the Organization of American States, which it uses as a tool to invade Latin American countries, is no longer very effective." He said, "The Latin American people see very clearly that the Havana Declaration is a correct measure to mobilize the Latin American people against U.S. imperialist aggression."

The Cuban guests talked about their understanding of U.S. imperialism based on their personal experiences. Minister Machado said, "The Cuban people have suffered direct aggression, humiliation, and deception by U.S. imperialism for more than fifty years, and we deeply feel that U.S. imperialism is despicable. Economically, it uses the banner of 'aiding underdeveloped countries' to plunder the natural and underground resources of various countries, transporting large quantities of raw materials to the United States. Morally, it tries its best to distort the psychology and characteristics of the people of various countries in order to undermine the patriotism and nationalism of the people of various countries."

Machado said, "The situation in Latin American countries can illustrate the nature of U.S. 'aid.' Although there has been U.S. economic and technical 'assistance' for many years, these countries have remained very backward in economic development, and the living standards of the people are very low. What U.S. imperialism gives is dollars, but what it takes back is the blood and sweat of the people of various countries."

    古巴卫生部长马查多在北京发表谈话
    没有任何力量能阻止古巴革命前进
    拉丁美洲各国人民已经认清美“援”是美帝国主义进行剥削掠夺的工具
    据新华社23日讯　古巴共和国卫生部部长何塞·罗曼·马查多·本图拉在离开我国前夕接见新华社记者时，严厉谴责美帝国主义对古巴进行的经济封锁，他强调地说：“古巴人民知道怎样进行反抗，他们要给美帝国主义以新的沉重的打击。古巴革命要向前发展，没有任何力量能够阻止我们前进。”
    马查多指出，美帝国主义这一新的侵略行为是它对古巴进行军事干涉前的种种卑鄙手段之一。他猛烈抨击美帝国主义自从古巴革命胜利以来所进行的反对古巴人民的活动。他特别指出，美帝国主义庇护和支持着从古巴逃出去的古巴战犯，并为他们提供进行反革命活动的基地，使他们得以从美国派飞机轰炸古巴的蔗田和城市；此外，还以美元和武器不断供给古巴反革命分子。总之，美国通过种种手段企图造成一个反对古巴的运动。
    马查多说：“美帝国主义的目的是要尽快扼杀古巴的革命，以消除古巴革命为拉丁美洲各国人民所树立的斗争榜样。”他说，过去和现在都受到美帝国主义残酷剥削和压迫的拉丁美洲各国人民都希望步古巴的后尘，争取自由和完全的独立。
    和马查多部长同时接见本社记者的古巴卫生代表团团员何塞·洛佩斯·桑却兹教授说：“美帝国主义对古巴进行经济封锁不仅不能表现出它的‘强大’，而且正是显示了它的虚弱。美国之所以采取这种措施，还因为它用来作为侵略拉丁美洲各国的工具的美洲国家组织现在已经不大顶事了。”他说：“拉丁美洲人民看得很清楚，哈瓦那宣言是正确地动员拉丁美洲人民反对美帝国主义侵略的措施。”
    古巴客人以他们亲身的经历谈到他们对美帝国主义的认识。马查多部长说：“古巴人民受美帝国主义直接侵略、欺侮和欺骗达五十多年，我们深深地体会到美帝国主义是卑鄙的。从经济上说，它打着‘援助落后国家’的招牌，大肆掠夺各国的自然资源、地下资源等，把原料大量运往美国。从道德上说，它尽量歪曲各国人民的心理和特色，以图打击各国人民的爱国主义和民族主义情绪。”
    马查多说：“拉丁美洲各国的情况可以说明美‘援’的性质。虽然多年来有着美国的经济和技术‘援助’，这些国家在经济发展上一直十分落后，人民生活水平很低。美帝国主义所给的是美元，但是收回的是各国人民的血汗。”
