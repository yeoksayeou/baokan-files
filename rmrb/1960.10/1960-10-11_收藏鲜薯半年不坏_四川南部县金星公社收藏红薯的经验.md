    Storing Fresh Sweet Potatoes for Half a Year Without Spoilage
    ——The Experience of the Jinxing People's Commune in Nanbu County, Sichuan in Storing Sweet Potatoes
    By our reporters Yu Jingqi and Wang Huandou
    In areas that are abundant in sweet potatoes (i.e., potatoes), there has long been a problem: in order to better arrange production and life, it is necessary to store fresh sweet potatoes for a long period, but generally, they can only be safely stored for about four months. Can this contradiction be overcome? Yes. Not long ago, when we visited the Jinxing People's Commune in Nanbu County, we ate deliciously sweet fresh sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes account for more than 75% of the total grain production of this commune. After the commune had a bumper harvest of sweet potatoes in 1959, it stored more than 5,400 cellars of sweet potatoes. These sweet potatoes withstood the test of severe winter and scorching heat, and the potato tubers remain bright in color and normal in quality and taste. In addition to some canteens eating fresh sweet potatoes until the summer grain harvest, five management areas had sweet potatoes until the autumn grain harvest. Because the problem of fresh sweet potato storage was solved, their rations are sufficient in all seasons. Moreover, they overfulfilled the grain purchase task. This year, the summer grain sold to the state alone accounted for more than 90% of the annual grain purchase task.
    Experience among the Masses
    Since the Great Leap Forward, the Jinxing People's Commune has taken large-scale sweet potato planting as an important measure to increase grain production, continuously expanding the area and trying every means to increase yield. Before last year's autumn harvest, facing the imminent sweet potato harvest, the commune members were both happy and afraid. They were happy because grain production had increased, and afraid of how to preserve so many sweet potatoes. All this made Cai Quanlin, the secretary of the commune party committee, realize that solving the sweet potato storage problem was not an ordinary technical problem. In order to solve this problem, he visited many commune members. Some commune members not only did not have long-term storage experience with sweet potatoes, but on the contrary, many people had experienced sweet potato rot accidents. But he was not discouraged and still insisted on finding solutions among the masses, looking at cellars whenever he saw them, and asking questions whenever he had the opportunity. Finally, he finally discovered that in the second management district there were several cellars of sweet potatoes that were put into the cellar in 1958, and the rare miracle that they had been preserved for more than six months without rotting.
    The commune member who kept these sweet potatoes was named Yang Baochun. His family has been managing sweet potatoes for three generations and has never experienced rot accidents. By the time of Yang Baochun's generation, the experience has become more and more abundant. Cai Quanlin found Yang Baochun, and immediately studied the technology of storing sweet potatoes with him, and personally summarized the experience. They also went to other places to learn the method of large cellar storage, combining the experience of small cellar and large cellar storage, and creatively concentrated the scattered small cellars into "small cellar groups." In this way, the two difficult problems of long-term fresh potato storage and large-scale storage were comprehensively broken through.
    Understanding Temperament and Prescribing the Right Medicine
    The most basic experience of the Jinxing People's Commune in storing sweet potatoes, in Cai Quanlin's words, is: sweet potatoes are living things, and whether planting or storing them, you must understand their temperament in order to come up with countermeasures. Because the skin of sweet potatoes is thin and tender, contains a lot of water, and is rich in starch and sugar, it is very susceptible to external temperature and humidity changes and infection with germs, causing sprouting or rotting. Therefore, the key to preserving sweet potatoes lies in controlling temperature and humidity, and reducing the possibility of germs entering and spreading. In their sweet potato storage, they grasped the following three measures based on this basic law:
    1. Observe the weather, the land, and diseases and pests, and pay attention to changes in these three aspects at all times. "Observing the weather" refers to observing the weather's temperature, whether it is sunny or cloudy; "Observing the land" refers to observing the terrain and soil of the sweet potato field and the sweet potato cellar; "Observing diseases and pests" refers to observing the environment and conditions for the breeding and growth of diseases and pests, and observing the disease and injury conditions on the sweet potato tubers. They deeply realized in practice that although there are many reasons for the development of temperature, humidity and diseases in the potato cellar, they basically come from these three aspects. "Three observations" can take timely measures based on changes in these factors, and choose or create the most favorable environment for preserving sweet potatoes.
    2. Starting from digging sweet potatoes, tightly grasp the preparation of harvesting, transporting, entering the cellar and management after entering the cellar, and carry it through to the end. The amount of water contained in sweet potatoes produced in cultivated land with different terrains and soils varies, and the amount of water affects the cellar storage temperature and disease conditions; the terrain height, drainage performance and soil dryness of the sweet potato cellar also have the same impact. Therefore, to do a good job in sweet potato storage, it should start before entering the cellar.
    3. In view of the changeable characteristics of the weather, land, and diseases and pests, establish a set of detailed working methods and systems in accordance with local conditions, grasp every detail, and do not let go of any specific problem.
    Adapting to Local Conditions and Applying Specifically
    Scientific, meticulous and proactive working methods are important reasons for the achievements of the Jinxing People's Commune in storing sweet potatoes.
    In terms of digging cellars and preparing to enter the cellar, cellar sites are generally selected in places that are not easily invaded by cold air, are well-ventilated and sunny, have good drainage performance, and have dry soil. Drainage ditches are dug in the cellar, ventilation pipes are set up, and sand and gravel are laid at the bottom of the cellar. Regardless of whether it is a new cellar or an old cellar, it must be cleaned and disinfected with fire before the sweet potatoes are put into the cellar.
    In terms of handling sweet potatoes and entering the cellar, timely digging of sweet potatoes and classified storage are implemented. Digging sweet potatoes requires choosing sunny days in seasons when the yield is not affected and the temperature is suitable, digging carefully and transporting lightly to reduce the water content and damage of the sweet potatoes. After digging, remove the sweet potato handles (leaving them slightly longer) and soil, classify good, bad, worm-eaten, and injured sweet potatoes and pile them separately, and store them long-term or short-term according to the degree of difficulty in storage, and number them by inserting cards into the cellar. Sweet potatoes produced in different terrains and soils and sweet potatoes of different ages and sizes are also stored separately. When storing, the sweet potatoes harvested on the same day should be put into the cellar on the same day, but the surface moisture must be dried; if the sweet potatoes cannot be put into the cellar on the same day, they should be piled in a place that is not easily exposed to wind and frost, and covered. When entering the cellar, load and pour lightly to prevent or reduce bumps and trampling injuries. The cellar storage should not be too full, and a certain space should be left for ventilation and temperature regulation. Moisture-absorbing straw bundles are laid on the surface of the sweet potatoes.
    In terms of storage management, they are managed in five stages. The first stage is after initial entry into the cellar: During this period, because the sweet potatoes contain a lot of water and are actively respiring, the cellar has a lot of water vapor and high humidity. The cellar should be opened every day for ventilation, opening early and closing late, and replacing the moisture-proof straw bundles; after twenty days, the temperature is higher and the humidity is greater, and the method of taking out the sweet potatoes in the center of the cellar can also be used for ventilation. The second stage is the winter stage: As the temperature decreases, the cellar opening should be closed to keep warm, the ventilation time should be shortened, and the ventilation should be changed to after sunrise and before sunset, and no ventilation should be done when the weather is bad. The third stage is the severe winter stage: Due to the severe cold, ventilation is changed to midday on sunny days, and the cellar opening is closed when the climate changes. The fourth stage is the beginning of spring stage: As the climate gradually warms, ventilation is done once every three to five days, and the cellar opening is left slightly open for ventilation. The fifth stage is the final stage: At this time, the temperature rises. In addition to opening the cellar every day, measures should also be taken to lower the temperature, and the storage volume should be gradually reduced. In order to effectively manage the sweet potatoes, the entire commune promoted a system of special personnel management and comparison and inspection in the storage area, implemented a storage responsibility system, and adopted measures of "two diligences" (diligent inspection and diligent covering of grass) and "three preventions" (preventing rot, preventing rats and sparrows, and preventing theft).
    A Group of Red Custodians is Needed
    To keep sweet potatoes well, it is not only necessary to have technology and methods, but more importantly, it is necessary to have a group of people like Yang Baochun who breathe together with sweet potatoes.
    The Jinxing People's Commune is exactly like this. They have cultivated a group of red custodians who have played a decisive role in storing sweet potatoes. The material conditions for storing sweet potatoes in this commune are not good, and the potato cellars are relatively simple, but they work diligently and earnestly with a loyal and enthusiastic heart. Take Yang Baochun, for example. In addition to participating in field production and rest every day, he spends the rest of his time turning around inside and outside the thirty-nine potato cellars he is responsible for.

    收藏鲜薯半年不坏
    ——四川南部县金星公社收藏红薯的经验
    本报记者　于竞祁　王焕斗
    在盛产红薯（即甘薯）的地区，长期以来存在着这样一个问题：为了更好地安排生产和生活，需要较长时期地贮存鲜薯，而一般却只能安全贮存四个来月。能不能克服这个矛盾呢？能。不久以前，我们就在南部县金星公社访问时，吃上了蜜甜的鲜薯。这个社的红薯在全年粮食总产中占75％以上。1959年全社红薯获得大丰收后，贮存了五千四百多窖红薯。这些红薯经受了严冬和酷暑的考验，至今薯块色泽鲜艳，质味正常。除了一部分食堂的鲜薯吃到夏粮登场外，有五个管理区的红薯一直吃到秋粮登场。由于解决了鲜薯贮存问题，他们四季口粮充足。而且超额完成了粮食征购任务。今年仅向国家交售的夏粮，就占到全年粮食征购任务的90％以上。
    经验在群众中
    大跃进以来，金星公社就把大种红薯做为增产粮食的一个重要措施，不断扩大面积，千方百计提高产量。在去年秋收前，面对即将来到的红薯丰收，社员们又是喜又是怕，喜的是粮食增产了，怕的是这样多的红薯怎样保存。这一切，使公社党委书记蔡全林意识到，解决红薯贮存问题不是一个普通的技术问题。为了解决这个问题，他访问过很多社员。一些社员不但没有长期贮存红薯的经验，相反，不少人都经过红薯霉烂的事故。但他并不灰心，仍然坚持在群众中找，见窖就看，有机会就问。最后，他终于发现了第二管区有几窖1958年入窖的红薯，保存了六个多月还没有霉烂的罕见奇迹。
    保管这些红薯的社员名叫杨保春。他家三辈人经管红薯从来没有发生过霉烂事故，到了杨保春这一辈，更是经验愈积累愈丰富。蔡全林找到了杨保春，立即和他一道研究贮藏红薯的技术，亲手进行总结，他们还到外地去学习大窖贮藏的办法，使小窖大窖贮藏经验结合起来，创造性地把分散的小窖集中成为“小窖群”。这样，就全面突破了鲜薯长贮和多贮两道难关。
    摸透脾气对症下药
    金星公社贮存红薯最基本的经验，用蔡全林的话来说是：红薯是有生命的东西，不论种植或保管，都要摸透它的脾气，才能想出对策。红薯由于表皮薄嫩，水分多，含有丰富淀粉和糖分，因而十分容易受外界温度、湿度变化的影响和感染病菌，引起生芽或腐烂。因此，保存红薯的关键，就在于控制温度和湿度，减少病菌侵入和蔓延的可能。他们在保管红薯中就根据这个基本规律，抓住了这样三条措施：
    一、看天、看地、看病害，时刻注意这三方面的变化。“看天”是指看天气冷暖、晴阴；“看地”是指看薯地和薯窖的地形、土壤；“看病害”是指看病害繁殖生长的环境和条件，看薯块上的病害和创伤情况。他们在实践中深深体会到，尽管引起薯窖内温度、湿度和病害发展的原因很多，但基本上是来自这三个方面。“三看”可以根据这些因素的变化，及时采取措施，从中选择或创造适于保存红薯的最有利的环境。
    二、从挖红薯开始，收、运、入窖准备和入窖后管理，环环抓紧一抓到底。不同地形、土壤的耕地生产出来的红薯所含的水分有多有少，水分多少又影响着窖藏温度和发病条件；薯窖地形高低、排水性能和土壤干湿程度，也具有同样的影响。因此做好红薯贮藏工作，应当从入窖以前开始。
    三、针对天、地、病害多变的特点，因地制宜地建立一套细致的工作方法和制度，把握每个细节，不放松任何一个具体问题。
    因地制宜，具体运用
    科学、细致、主动的工作方法，是金星公社贮藏红薯取得成就的重要原因。
    在打窖和入窖准备方面，窖址一般都选择不易受冷空气侵袭、通风向阳、排水性能好、土质干燥的地方。窖内挖有排水沟，设置通风筒，窖底铺垫沙石。无论新窖旧窖，在红薯入窖前都要打扫，烧火消毒。
    在处理红薯和入窖方面，实行适时挖薯，分类贮藏。挖红薯要选择产量不受影响、气温适宜的季节的晴朗日子，细挖轻运，以减少红薯含水量和伤损。挖起后还要去掉薯把（稍留长一些）和泥土，把好、坏、虫、伤各种红薯分类堆放，按保管难易程度分别做长期或短期贮藏，按窖插牌编号。对不同地形、土壤生产的红薯和老嫩、大小不同的红薯，也实行分类贮藏。在贮藏的时候，当天收的当天下窖，但必须晾干表面水份；不能当天下窖的应堆放在不易受风霜的地方，并加上复盖。入窖时要轻装轻倒，防止或减少碰伤、踩伤。窖藏装薯不能过满，应留一定的空间，以利通风和调节温度。薯面铺吸潮草把。
    在贮藏管理方面，他们分成五个阶段进行管理。一是初期入窖以后：这一时期由于红薯含水分多，呼吸旺盛，窖内水气大，湿度大，每天应开窖敞气，早开晚闭，并更换防潮草把；二十天后，温度更高，湿度更大，还可辅以取出窖中心红薯的办法通风透气。二是冬季阶段：随着气温降低，应封闭窖口保温，缩短敞气时间，敞气改为日出后和日落前，天气不好不敞气。三是数九寒天阶段：由于严寒，改为晴天中午敞气，在气候变化的时候封闭窖口。四是打春阶段：由于气候渐暖，每三五天敞气一次，窖口并稍留空隙透气。五是末期：这时气温上升，除天天敞窖外，还应采取措施降温，贮藏量应逐渐减少。为了切实管好红薯，全社在贮藏区推广了专人保管和评比检查制度，实行了保管责任制，采取了“两勤”（勤检查勤盖草）“三防”（防烂、防鼠雀、防偷盗）的措施。
    需要一批红色保管员
    保管好红薯，不仅要有技术和方法，更重要的是要有一批像杨保春这样与红薯共呼吸的人。
    金星公社正是如此。他们培养了一批对贮藏红薯起了决定作用的红色的保管员。这个公社保管红薯的物质条件并不好，薯窖也比较简陋，但他们却凭着一颗忠诚火热的心，勤勤恳恳地努力工作。以杨保春说吧，他每天除了参加田间生产和休息以外，其他时间，就在他负责的三十九个薯窖里里外外打转转。
