Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 16th. Zhejiang Province's single-season late rice has ripened successively, and a tense autumn harvest battle has begun from southern Zhejiang to northern Zhejiang, from mountainous areas to plains. As of the 14th, the province has harvested 557,000 mu of late rice.

In this year's autumn harvest work, Zhejiang Province has prepared early and acted quickly. After firmly establishing the concept that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and grain is the foundation of the foundation, the broad masses of commune members and cadres have tightly grasped the key to careful harvesting and threshing, striving for as much autumn harvest as possible and ensuring that every grain is stored. All localities have mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of careful harvesting and threshing over the years, and formulate operating procedures for careful harvesting and threshing of late rice, making full preparations ideologically, materially, and technically. For example, the "Mulan" group in Ruian County, the provincial model for careful harvesting and threshing, carefully checked every link in the harvest of late rice last year and early rice this year before harvesting, and found effective methods such as queuing up by plot, harvesting at the right time, gently grasping and quickly cutting, improving the technology of using large sickles, adopting the "T" shaped knife method, promoting the small handful fan-shaped frequent threshing method, and improving tools. They carried forward the past strengths, blocked all loopholes, and ensured careful and good harvesting.

Leading cadres in various localities have gone deep into the front line of production during the late rice harvest to strengthen leadership. After the Party Committee of Hedi Commune in Longquan County summarized the experience of Lingtou Brigade in good quality and high efficiency of late rice harvesting, it immediately organized more than 700 cadres in the commune to go deep into the teams and threshing grounds. Based on the strength of labor and the technical requirements of each process, they helped to reasonably arrange labor, and promoted new agricultural tools, thus greatly accelerating the progress of harvesting.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 16th. Mid-season rice, soybeans, peanuts and other crops in Guangxi are entering the busy season of harvest. As of the 10th, the entire autonomous region had harvested 1,999,900 mu of mid-season rice, accounting for 41% of the planted area; one-third of soybeans had been harvested; and nearly half of peanuts had been harvested. Other late corn, autumn sweet potatoes, autumn buckwheat, miscellaneous beans, and minor grains have also matured successively and begun to be harvested.

In order to free up land for winter planting as soon as possible, all localities generally organized commune members to conduct field surveys before the autumn harvest, and conducted land and crop inventories, harvesting each plot as it ripened. Based on the characteristics of the current autumn harvest crops having different maturity times and the urgency of the season, Huaiqun Commune in Luocheng County adopted a method of combining mass movements with specialized teams, harvesting extensively when ripe and minimally when less ripe. For sweet potatoes, rice beans, etc., which are planted in pieces and ripen relatively uniformly, the commune organized the entire community to carry out a concentrated assault for two days, harvesting more than 80,000 jin in total. For cat beans, taro, etc., which are not planted over large areas and mature at different times, specialized teams composed of auxiliary labor are organized to pick them up every day, harvesting each plot as it ripens, harvesting each string as it ripens.

In order to accelerate the progress of harvesting, all localities have vigorously promoted advanced harvesting tools and carried out a movement of pacesetters and skilled workers. For example, Yan Cha Commune in Longlin Autonomous County promoted more than 600 rapid harvesting devices, increasing work efficiency by more than double compared to last year. During the pacesetter movement in He Gui Brigade, Lianghe Commune, Quanzhou County, pacesetter Deng Yuexing emerged, who harvested 2.3 mu per day and threshed 1,090 jin, as well as 12 other pacesetters and skilled workers. Under their influence, the pace of rushing to harvest and plant has been greatly accelerated. Lingui County has planted more than 4,000 mu of sweet potatoes while basically completing the harvest of mid-season rice.

During the autumn harvest, all localities regard careful harvesting and threshing as an important part of running agriculture and grain production in a big way. Ideological education on careful harvesting and threshing and cherishing food has been widely carried out among commune members, and various systems have been established. Hu Jide, the Party Branch Secretary of Shang'an Brigade, Lianghe Commune, Quanzhou County, went deep into the production teams to check for possible loopholes in each link, and studied with commune members to formulate a series of measures for careful harvesting and threshing of each process such as cutting, threshing, transporting, drying, winnowing, and managing, striving to ensure that every grain is stored. At present, in addition to harvesting mid-season rice, a large number of various dryland grains and oil crops are also being harvested. Due to the extensive interplanting and intercropping, there are many types of crops and large areas, and the maturity times vary. If there is a slight negligence during harvesting, it is easy to cause waste. Therefore, all localities attach great importance to the work of re-harvesting and re-threshing. For example, in Beigeng Commune, Xincheng County, the entire commune organized 1,250 people to carry out a re-harvesting and re-threshing movement, and re-harvested more than 42,300 jin of miscellaneous beans in just three days.

During the rush harvest, all localities also paid great attention to the work of managing grain. Yan Gang Brigade, Yan Gang Commune, Debao County, established an acceptance system and organized an acceptance team to weigh and accept each plot of harvested grain, and strictly implemented warehousing procedures. In Yan'an Commune, Ziyuan County, the Xiumu Brigade did not have enough drying grounds, so commune members automatically took out 100 grain mats, so that the harvested grain could be dried in time and stored in time, ensuring that the grain would not be damaged by mold.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th. Jiangsu Province is seizing the time to thresh mid-season rice and prepare to harvest late rice. At present, except for a few places in the Xuzhou area that are finishing up, all other areas in the province have harvested and transported more than 17 million mu of mid-season rice to the threshing grounds, and more than 60% of it has been threshed, generally meeting the requirements of timely harvesting and careful harvesting and threshing.

This year, the progress of mid-season rice harvesting and threshing in various localities in Jiangsu has been faster than in previous years. Before the start of the autumn planting, all localities universally promoted the "one-stop" method of "cutting, transporting, threshing, drying, winnowing, weighing, storing, and managing" autumn harvest to speed up the progress of the autumn harvest; after the autumn planting began, they adopted the method of using planting to promote harvesting, using harvesting to promote planting, and harvesting and planting simultaneously to rationally arrange the labor, livestock power, and tools for autumn harvest and autumn planting, so as to ensure that both autumn harvest and autumn planting are not neglected. After uniformly arranging labor, Nantong Prefecture has threshed 70% of the 1.33 million mu of mid-season rice in the entire district, and the progress of autumn planting is also twice as fast as in the same period last year. In order to speed up the progress of threshing, improve threshing efficiency, and save manpower, all localities have universally used threshing machines to thresh mid-season rice.

While accelerating the progress of threshing mid-season rice, all localities paid great attention to the quality of harvesting and threshing, universally strengthened field management, and achieved clean and pure harvesting, with no grains lost. The field work team of the Fifth Production Team of Yanglou Brigade, Jinhu Commune, Jianhu County, grasped "threshing, drying, transporting, and managing" together. The entire work team established four groups: storage, threshing, inspection, and security. The storage group is responsible for registering the rice bundles on the field, recording accounts after threshing, storing them by variety, stamping each pile, paying with evidence, and managing by special personnel; the threshing group is responsible for threshing the rice bundles as soon as they arrive, threshing, winnowing, drying, and storing them at the same time, ensuring that they are thoroughly threshed, thoroughly winnowed, thoroughly picked up, and thoroughly swept; the inspection group is responsible for inspecting the grain storage in the field to ensure that the field is well managed and prevent mold and losses; the security group is responsible for the safety of the field and warehouse to prevent accidents. After the entire work team strengthened field management, the more than 190 mu of mid-season rice that had entered the field were harvested cleanly and purely, with every grain stored and no grass lost. In the process of harvesting and threshing mid-season rice, Dongtai County universally established field bookkeeping, acceptance systems, and field covenants. More than 10,000 county, commune, and production team cadres throughout the county went deep into the fields and worked, lived, and studied with commune members, studying measures for careful harvesting and threshing. Wang Xu, the First Secretary of the Party Committee of Qindong Commune, discovered that the threshing of more than 60 mu of mid-season rice in the Third Team of Luo'er Brigade was relatively rough, and immediately mobilized commune members to re-thresh it, harvesting more than 20 jin of rice per mu.

At present, all localities in the province are stepping up the threshing of mid-season rice while mobilizing cadres and commune members to summarize the experience of careful harvesting and threshing of mid-season rice and actively preparing to harvest late rice. Suzhou Prefecture, which has a large area of late rice, has completed the preparations for harvesting, and labor and tools have been fully equipped. (Attached picture)

    广树标兵大搞竞赛细收秋粮
    浙江发动群众总结经验，制订秋收操作规程，力争秋收多多益善
    广西广泛进行爱护粮食宣传教育，订出各种制度，实行复打复收
    江苏注意中稻收打质量，普遍加强场头管理，保证达到收清扬净
    本报杭州16日电　浙江省各地单季晚稻已经先后黄熟，一场紧张的秋收战斗序幕从浙南到浙北，从山区到平原已经揭开了。到14日为止，全省已收割晚稻五十五万七千亩。　　
    浙江省各地今年的秋收工作，准备早、行动快。广大社员和干部在坚固地树立了农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础的观念以后，紧紧把住细收细打这一关，力争秋收多多益善，颗粒归仓。各地都曾发动群众，总结历年细收细打经验，制订晚稻细收细打的操作规程，从思想上、物质上、技术上作好充分准备。如全省细收细打标兵——瑞安县“花木兰”小组，在收割前曾认真地检查了去年晚稻和今年早稻收获中的每个环节，找出了逐丘排队、适时收割，轻握快割，提高使用大镰刀的技术，采用“丁”字形上刀法，推广小把扇形勤翻脱粒法，改进工具等有效方法，发扬了过去的长处，堵塞一切漏洞，确保收得细收得好。
    各地领导干部在晚稻收割中，都深入生产第一线，加强领导。龙泉县荷地公社党委总结岭头大队晚稻收割质量好、工效高的经验后，立即组织全社七百多名干部，深入小组，深入打谷场，根据劳力强弱，和各道工序的技术要求，帮助合理安排劳力，并且推广新式农具，因而大大加快了收割进度。
    本报南宁16日电　广西中稻和黄豆、花生等作物进入收获大忙。到10日止，全自治区已收中稻一百九十九万九千亩，占种植面积的41％；黄豆已收三分之一；花生收获近一半。其他晚玉米、秋红薯、秋荞麦、杂豆、小杂粮等，也陆续成熟，开始收割。
    为了及早腾出冬种用地，各地在秋收前普遍组织社员临田勘查，进行土地、作物排队，黄一块、收一块。罗城县怀群公社根据当前秋收作物成熟时间不一，而季节急迫的特点，采取大搞群众运动与专业队相结合的办法，大熟大收，小熟小收。对于成片种植而又成熟较齐的红薯、饭豆等，组织全社力量突击两天，共收八万多斤。对面积不多，成熟迟早不一的猫豆、芋头等，则组织辅助劳动力编成专业队，天天拣收，黄一块收一块，黄一串收一串。
    为了加快收割进度，各地大力推广了先进收割工具和开展了标兵能手运动。如隆林各族自治县岩茶公社推广了快速收割器六百多把，工效比去年提高一倍多。全州县两河公社合桂大队在开展标兵运动中，出现日割二亩三分、打谷一千零九十斤的标兵邓跃兴，以及其他标兵能手十二人，在他们影响下，抢收抢种的进度大大加快。临桂县在基本收完中稻的同时，还种下了红薯四千多亩。
    在秋收中，各地把细收细打看作是大办农业，大办粮食的重要一环。在社员中普遍进行了细收细打、爱护粮食的思想教育，订出了各种制度。全州县两河公社上安大队党支部书记胡技德深入生产队，检查各个环节可能出现的漏洞，同社员研究制定了割、打、运、晒、风、管等一系列工序的精打细收的措施，力争颗粒归仓。目前，除了收割中稻，还大量收获各种旱地粮和油料作物，由于大搞间种套种，作物的种类多，面积大，而成熟时间不一，在收获时如少有疏忽，就容易造成抛撒浪费。因此，各地十分重视复收复打工作。如忻城县北更公社，全社组织一千二百五十人开展复收复打运动，仅三天就复收杂豆四万二千三百多斤。
    在抢收中，各地还十分注意管好粮食工作。德保县燕岗公社燕岗大队，建立验收制度，组织验收小组，收一块过秤验收一块，并严格执行入仓手续。资源县延安公社修睦大队晒场不够，社员自动拿出一百张谷垫，使收回来的粮食都能及时晒完，及时入库，保证粮食不受霉坏。
    本报南京16日电　江苏省各地抓紧时间脱粒中稻，准备收割晚稻。目前，全省一千七百多万亩中稻除徐州地区少数地方在扫尾外，其他地区已全部收割登场，并已脱粒60％以上，普遍达到及时收割、精收细打的要求。
    今年，江苏各地中稻收割脱粒进度都比往年快。在秋种开始前，各地普遍推广了“割、运、打、晒、扬、秤、藏、管”秋收“一条龙”的办法，加快秋收进度；秋种开始后，又采取以种带收、以收促种、边收边种的办法，合理安排秋收秋种的劳力、畜力和工具，做到秋收秋种两不误。南通专区在统一安排劳力后，全区一百三十三万亩中稻已脱粒70％，秋种的进度也比去年同期快了一倍。为了加快脱粒的进度，提高脱粒工效，节省人力，各地普遍使用了脱粒机脱粒中稻。
    各地在加快脱粒中稻进度的同时，十分注意收打质量，普遍加强了场头管理，达到收清扬净，颗粒不丢。建湖县近湖公社杨楼大队第五生产队场头作业组“打、晒、运、管”一齐抓，全作业组分别成立保管、打场、检查、保卫四个小组。保管组负责稻把上场登记、脱粒后记账、分品种囤存，囤囤盖印、支付有据、专人管理；打场组负责稻把到场就打，边打、边扬、边晒、边进仓，做到打净、扬净、拾净、扫净；检查组负责检查场头粮食保管情况，保证场头管理得好，防止霉烂损失；保卫组负责场头、仓库安全情况，防止发生意外损失。全作业组加强了场头管理后，已进场的一百九十多亩中稻，都做到收清扬净，粒粒归仓，寸草不丢。东台县在收割、脱粒中稻过程中，普遍建立场头记账、验收制度和场头公约。全县一万多名县、社和生产队干部深入场头和社员实行“四同”，研究精收细打的措施。溱东公社党委第一书记王诩在罗二大队第三小队发现有六十多亩中稻脱粒比较粗糙，随即发动社员复打一遍，每亩多收稻子二十多斤。
    目前，全省各地一面加紧脱粒中稻，一面发动干部社员总结中稻精收细打的经验，积极准备收割晚稻。晚稻面积较大的苏州专区，收割的准备工作已经就绪，劳力、工具都已配套成龙。（附图片）
