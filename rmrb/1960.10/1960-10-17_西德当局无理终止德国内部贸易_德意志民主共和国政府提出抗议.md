    West German Authorities Unreasonably Terminate Intra-German Trade
    Government of the German Democratic Republic Protests
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 14th: The government of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on the 14th, protesting the West German authorities and the West Berlin Senate's unreasonable termination of the agreement on intra-German trade.
    The statement said that the West German authorities, by severing the last ties between the two Germanys, are pursuing a policy of deepening the division of Germany. This anti-national policy can only benefit the forces in West Germany that are stepping up their atomic armament and preparing for a new war. The termination of this agreement is also aimed at attempting to hinder the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic. The Bonn government has repeatedly made such attempts in the past, but they have all failed. This new attack on the economic development of the German Democratic Republic will absolutely not stop its socialist development.

    西德当局无理终止德国内部贸易
    德意志民主共和国政府提出抗议
    新华社柏林14日电　德意志民主共和国政府14日发表声明，抗议西德当局和西柏林参议院毫无理由地终止关于德国内部贸易协议的行为。
    声明说，西德当局通过切断两个德国之间的最后联系，来推行加深德国分裂的政策，这个反民族的政策只能有利于西德加紧进行原子武装和准备新战争的势力。终止这个协议，其目的也在于企图阻挠德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设。波恩政府过去曾经一再作过这种尝试，但是都遭到了失败。对德意志民主共和国经济发展的这一新进攻，绝对阻止不了它的社会主义发展。
