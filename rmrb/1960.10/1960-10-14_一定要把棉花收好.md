    Be Sure to Harvest the Cotton Well
    Yudong
    After a year of hard work and a tenacious struggle against various natural disasters, the cotton harvest has reached its peak season. In the vast cotton fields, there are now countless silver blossoms, a field of white. Cotton is an important industrial raw material and the source of people's clothing. Every cotton boll is precious and hard-earned. We must harvest this year's cotton well and pick it clean!
    Cotton differs from other crops; the quality of the harvesting work greatly affects the yield and quality of the cotton. All regions must pay special attention to the cotton harvesting work.
    Cotton is different from other crops in that it does not mature all at once and is not harvested in a single go. The early summer bolls, summer bolls, and autumn bolls open successively and are harvested successively. The harvesting period is relatively long. If it is not harvested as it opens, a wind and rain will cause great losses. As the cotton is being harvested, it continues to grow. If the harvesting work is rough, causing broken branches and fallen bolls, it will affect the growth and opening of the cotton bolls. According to the requirements of industrial processing, production, and use, cotton must not only be harvested in a timely manner, but also harvested, stored, and processed by grade, so as not to reduce the grade and quality of the cotton, and to achieve high quality, good prices, and good use.
    Since cotton opens successively and is so "delicate," and poor harvesting will affect the yield and quality, in order to harvest more cotton and harvest it well, we must not be afraid of trouble or try to save effort by waiting for all the cotton to open before harvesting it all at once, or by putting the cotton harvesting work aside because we are busy with other tasks, causing unnecessary losses by not picking it in a timely manner. Instead, we must further strengthen the leadership of the harvesting work, properly arrange labor, and educate those who participate in picking cotton on the importance of cherishing cotton, explaining technical specifications and quality requirements, and truly achieving timely and careful harvesting, ensuring that the burs are clean, the fields are clean, the roadsides are clean, and the threshing grounds are clean, implementing "double-pocket" cotton picking, storing separately, and inspecting by grade, and truly harvesting the cotton well.
    Various regions have many advanced experiences on how to harvest cotton well, among which the most important is to establish a responsibility system, organize dedicated personnel, contract specific areas and acres, clarify responsibilities, ensure quality and quantity, and assign someone to be responsible for the harvesting of each cotton field until the end. These experiences are all very good and should be earnestly promoted.

    一定要把棉花收好
    豫东
    经过整年辛勤地劳动，和同各种自然灾害的顽强斗争，棉花已经到了收获的盛期。在广大的棉田里，现在已经是银花朵朵，一片雪白。棉花是重要的工业原料，也是人们的衣着之源，每一朵棉花都是宝贵的，每一朵棉花都来之不易，我们一定要把今年的棉花收好摘净！
    棉花同其他农作物不同，收摘工作的好坏，在很大程度上影响棉花的产量和质量，各地要特别注意棉花的收获工作。
    棉花和别的作物不同，它不是集中成熟、一次收获。伏前桃、伏桃、秋桃陆续开放，陆续收摘，收获的时期较长，如果不能作到随开随摘，一场风雨就会带来很大损失。棉花一边收摘，一边还在继续生长，如果收摘工作粗糙，造成断枝落桃，就会影响棉桃成长和开放。依照工业加工生产和使用的要求，棉花不仅要做到适时收摘，还要分等收摘、存放，分级加工，这样才不至降低棉花等级和质量，能达到优质、优价、优用。
    既然棉花是陆续开放又这样“娇嫩”，收摘不好就要影响产量和质量，为了多收花，收好花，我们就不能怕麻烦，图省事，等棉花都开了再去集中收摘，或者其他活路一忙，就把收棉工作挤在后边，不适时采摘，造成不应有的损失。而是要进一步加强对收摘工作的领导，妥善安排劳力，并对参加摘棉花的人进行珍惜棉花的思想教育，讲清技术规格和质量要求，真正做到适时细收细摘，达到壳里净、地里净、路边净、场里净，实行“双兜”摘棉，分类保管，分级验收，切切实实地把棉花收好。
    对于如何收好棉花，各地都有许多先进经验，其中最重要的，就是要建立责任制度，组织专人，包片包亩，明确责任，保质保量，对每一块棉花的收获，都有人包干负责到底。这些经验都很好，应该认真地加以推广。
