Promote the Mass Line in Work Style and Solidly Carry Out Autumn Planting
    Xin Sheng Production Team Signs Three-Guarantee Contracts and Eight Agreements
    Jingmen County Party Committee Decides to Promote the Production Team's Experience Throughout the County
    Editor's Note: How to do a good job in the "Three Guarantees" work? The experience of the Xin Sheng Production Team proves that as long as we act in accordance with the Party's policies and boldly mobilize the masses, we will definitely be able to do a good job in this work; once the masses accept the "Three Guarantees", they will inevitably be determined to achieve overproduction, which will promote production to rise steadily.

    (Dispatch from this newspaper) The Xin Sheng Production Team of Ziling Commune, Jingmen County, Hubei Province, promoted the mass line work style, resolutely implemented policies, and realistically carried out the "Three Guarantees" work for this year's autumn planting.
    This time, when the Xin Sheng Production Team carried out the "Three Guarantees" work, it first let the masses discuss freely. The team consulted with the commune members on how much area each small team should contract, and how much each crop should guarantee; then they consulted with the production team. The method of consultation was also to rely on mutual evaluation among the teams to achieve fairness and rationality. After all production, total work points, and total investment were assessed, they were recorded and written into the "Three Guarantees Contract". The secretary of the production team's Party branch, the captain, and the small team leader signed the contract to ensure that it would be implemented.
    On October 8th, when the production team and the Second Small Team formally signed the "Three Guarantees Contract", Comrade Wang Yanchun, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, and Comrade Mei Bai, First Secretary of the Jingmen County Party Committee, both attended. They accepted the invitation of the production team and also signed the "Three Guarantees Contract" as witnesses, responsible for supervising the implementation of the "Three Guarantees Contract". After the signing, Comrade Wang Yanchun addressed the people present.
    The "Three Guarantees Contract" between the Xin Sheng Production Team and the Second Small Team was formulated as follows: The members of the Second Small Team, in the spirit of adapting to local conditions, fully discussed the area that could be planted in the autumn this year, and with reference to the actual yield in normal years, contracted the total output of crops to the production team. The total grain planting area of the small team this autumn is 382 mu, contracting 35,215 jin of grain. The area of rapeseed and green manure is 245 mu, contracting 500 jin of rapeseed, 1,890 jin of hairy vetch, and 624,000 jin of green manure. According to the area and total output of the various crops contracted by the small team, the production team contracted 3,019 work points to the small team, and contracted 158 yuan of production investment to the small team according to the actual needs of production; the cash was issued to the small team on a monthly basis; no extra payments were made if the cost exceeded the amount, and any savings belonged to the small team.
    In order to ensure the implementation of the "Three Guarantees Contract" and promote the enthusiasm of the production team for overproduction, the production team and the team also signed eight agreements in the "Three Guarantees": First, the overproduction part of the team is divided into "30-70," with 30 percent going to the production team and 70 percent awarded to the team. Second, the income from expanding the autumn planting area after the guarantee is divided into "30-70," with 30 percent going to the production team and 70 percent belonging to the team. Third, the income from reclaimed wasteland this year is not guaranteed, and the income is divided into "30-70," with 30 percent going to the production team and 70 percent belonging to the team. Fourth, the income from small grains, vegetables, and rapeseed planted by the team in front of and behind houses, in the fields, and along the edges of the land belongs entirely to the team. Fifth, the income from the commune members' private plots, whether they grow grain, vegetables, or fodder, belongs entirely to the commune members' disposal. Sixth, the income from the team's sideline occupations outside of the guarantee belongs entirely to the team. Seventh, the income from the team's overproduction award, the income from reclaimed wasteland, and the income from expanding the area after the guarantee, the grain part of these three parts of income is paid to the team with 20% in kind, and the rest is paid in cash. Eighth, after the guarantee, the team has the right to plant according to local conditions, the right to arrange work, the right to allocate labor and cattle, the right to formulate technical measures suitable for the team, the right to spend funds belonging to the team, the right to operate a small amount of sideline production, and the right to reclaim scattered wasteland and vacant land, implementing multiple planting and multiple harvests.

    The Xin Sheng Production Team relies on the small team and the masses to do a good job in the "Three Guarantees" and earnestly sign the "Three Guarantees Contract." This method effectively prevents subjectivism and mobilizes the enthusiasm of the team and the commune members. The cadres are happy and the commune members are also happy. Then, they further formulated a plan for overproduction, specifically arranged the autumn planting work, and were determined to win the victory of autumn planting and fire the first shot for the Great Leap Forward next year. The Jingmen County Party Committee decided to promote the experience of this production team throughout the county. (Attached picture)

    大兴群众路线工作作风　扎扎实实搞好秋种
    新生生产队签订三包合同和八条协议
    中共荆门县委决定在全县推广这个生产队的经验
    编者按：如何搞好“三包”工作？新生生产队的经验证明：只要按照党的政策办事，放手发动群众，就一定能够搞好这项工作；一当群众接受了“三包”，必然有决心实现超产，这样就会促进生产节节上升。
    本报讯　湖北荆门县子陵公社新生生产队大兴群众路线的工作作风，坚决贯彻政策，实事求是地搞好今年秋种的“三包”工作。
    新生生产队这次搞“三包”工作，首先放手让群众讨论，每个小队有多少面积应当包产，各种作物应该包多少，都征求了社员的意见；然后和生产队协商，协商的办法，也是依靠各小队互相评议，达到公平合理。总产量、总工数、总投资全部评定以后，记下来，写入“三包合同”，生产队党支部书记、队长和小队长双方都在合同上签字，保证按合同执行。
    10月8日，生产队和第二小队正式签订“三包合同”的时候，省委书记处书记王延春同志、荆门县委第一书记梅白同志都参加了。他们接受了这个生产小队的邀请，也在“三包合同”上签了字，做了见证人，负责监督“三包合同”的贯彻执行。签字以后，王延春同志向到会的人讲了话。
    新生生产队和第二小队的“三包合同”是这样制定的：二小队社员本着因地制宜的精神充分讨论了今年可以秋种的面积，参照了正常年景的实际产量，按作物向生产队承包总产量。全小队今年秋种粮食面积三百八十二亩，承包粮食三万五千二百一十五斤。油菜和绿肥面积二百四十五亩，承包油菜五百斤，苕子一千八百九十斤，绿肥六十二万四千斤。生产队根据小队承包的各项作物面积和总产量，向小队包工三千零一十九个，根据生产的实际需要，向小队包生产投资一百五十八元；包现金，按月发给小队，超过不补，节约归小队。
    为了保证“三包合同”的贯彻执行和促进生产小队超产的积极性，生产队和小队还在“三包”中订了八条协议：第一，小队超产部分实行“三七开”，三成交生产队，七成奖给小队。第二，包产后扩大秋种面积的收入实行三七开，三成交生产队，七成归小队。第三，今年开荒面积不包产，收入实行“三七开”，三成交生产队，七成归小队。第四，小队房前屋后、田头地边见缝插针和套种间作的小杂粮、蔬菜、油菜等，收入全部归小队。第五，社员自留地的收入，不论种粮食、蔬菜、饲料，收入全部归社员支配。第六，包产以外的小队副业，收入全部归小队支配。第七，小队超产得奖部分、开荒所得部分和包产后扩大面积所得部分，这三个部分的收入，粮食部分付给小队20％的实物，其余付给现金。第八，包产以后，小队有权因地种植，有权安排活路，有权支配劳动力和耕牛，有权制定适合于本队的技术措施，有权开支小队所有部分的资金，有权经营少量的副业生产，有权开垦零星荒地和空隙地，实行多种多收。
    新生生产队依靠小队、依靠群众，搞好“三包”，认真签订“三包合同”的办法，有效地防止了主观主义，调动了小队和社员的积极性，干部高兴，社员也高兴。接着，他们就进一步制定了超产的计划。具体地安排秋种工作，决心夺取秋种的胜利，打响明年大跃进的第一炮。中共荆门县委决定在全县推广这个生产队的经验。（附图片）
