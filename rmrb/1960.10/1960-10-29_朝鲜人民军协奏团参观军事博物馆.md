Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The entire Korean People's Army Ensemble, led by Major General Zhang Ruihuan, visited the Chinese People's Revolution Military Museum this morning, accompanied by Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Senior Colonel Li Wei, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department.

The distinguished guests met Luo Diekai, the father of internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao, and Hu Xiudao, Sun Zhongguo, and Guo Enzhi, representatives of former Volunteer Army combat heroes and meritorious individuals, at the museum. The two sides were very excited upon meeting, applauding warmly. Major General Zhang Ruihuan said: "Today, we are very happy to see the former Volunteer Army heroes who left indelible achievements in Korea with incomparable bravery and the father of martyr Luo Shengjiao. I extend my heartfelt greetings to you on behalf of the Korean People's Army." Subsequently, Major General Zhang Ruihuan, on behalf of the Korean People's Army Ensemble, presented gifts to Luo Diekai, Hu Xiudao, and Sun Zhongguo, and handed over a letter that Cui ? had asked him to bring to "Chinese Father" to Luo Diekai. Major General Zhang Ruihuan also entrusted relevant departments to forward the valuable gifts from the Korean People's Army Ensemble to the families of Volunteer Army martyrs Huang Jiguang and Yang Gensi, as well as the letter from a certain outpost company of the Korean People's Army stationed on Shangganling to Huang Jiguang's mother, expressing their respect and greetings. When Major General Zhang Ruihuan presented the gifts, the guests and hosts repeatedly applauded warmly.

The former Volunteer Army heroes and their Korean comrades visited the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Hall together. The comrades held hands, very affectionately. Guo Enzhi, a former first-class hero and special-class meritorious individual of the Volunteer Army, was moved when he saw the wooden frame used by Kim Chan-do, a Korean farmer in his sixties, to carry grain for the Volunteer Army. He excitedly said to his Korean comrades: "I was wounded in a battle, and at that time, an old Korean man braved enemy fire, regardless of his own danger, and took me to the hospital on an ox. I often think of that old man. Our Volunteer Army in Korea achieved victory because we received the full support and meticulous care of the Korean people. At the same time, it was also because the Korean people bravely resisted the American aggressors that the Chinese people could carry out construction safely." The distinguished guests were also very moved when they saw the photos and relics of martyr Huang Jiguang. Ensemble member Park Sang-eun said: "Huang Jiguang is not only a hero of the Chinese people, but also a hero of the Korean people. I have met Huang's mother and even took a photo with her. We treat her like our own mother."

The Korean People's Army Ensemble also presented China-Korea Friendship Commemorative Medals to the staff of the Military Museum. Major General Jia Ruoyu, curator of the Chinese People's Revolution Military Museum, also presented Military Museum Commemorative Medals to Major General Zhang Ruihuan and all members of the Korean People's Army Ensemble.
