    Under the Chestnut Tree
    Qi Zhibang

    This year, October 25th, marks the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' departure to Korea to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Every time this great festival arrives, I naturally recall the combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean people's armies fighting side by side, and recall our deep friendship with the Korean people. One thing is unforgettable for me.

    In September 1957, late autumn came to Yongjeong-ri, Icheon County (where "gun" is equivalent to our county, and "ri" is equivalent to our township) on the 38th parallel in Korea. The mountains and fields began to shed their deep green summer clothes and put on dark red and coffee-colored autumn clothes. The 9th Company of a certain unit of our Volunteer Army lived in the same mountain valley as the people of Yongjeong-ri, only two li apart. Behind the 9th Company's barracks, there were several chestnut trees, and the abundant fruits, bigger than pigeon eggs, were truly lovely. As late autumn approached, the chestnuts ripened and fell to the ground one by one, covering the ground. The soldiers of the 9th Company went up the mountain for tactical exercises every day, and had to pass under the chestnut trees four times. Whenever they passed, their faces were naturally filled with smiles, and they kept praising, "What good chestnuts! This year is sure to be a bumper year!" However, no one thought of bending down and picking a chestnut to taste. Every soldier kept firmly in mind Chairman Mao's teaching of "cherishing every mountain, every river, every tree and blade of grass in Korea."

    As time went on, more and more chestnuts fell on the ground, but no one came to collect them, and everyone was worried that the chestnuts would rot and be lost. Someone came up with the idea of putting a large bamboo basket from the cookhouse under the tree, and pasting a red paper on the tree. Three neat lines were written on the paper: "Cherish every mountain, every river, every tree and blade of grass of the Korean people! Whoever passes by here, pick up the chestnuts and put them in the basket, don't forget." It was very eye-catching. All the comrades in the company said that this idea was good after reading the paper. Since then, whenever they passed under the chestnut tree on the way to and from the exercise, every soldier stopped, bent down, and picked up the chestnuts on the ground one by one into the basket. One day, just as the soldiers were picking chestnuts, an old Korean man in his sixties came to the chestnut tree with a cloth bag. He looked at the red paper pasted on the tree, looked and looked again, and recognized it over and over again, but he didn't understand what was written on the paper. A soldier saw it, turned around, and read the words on the paper to the old man one by one. The old man shook his head and said he didn't understand. The soldier pointed to the comrades who were picking chestnuts, and made a gesture of filling the basket with chestnuts, and then pointed to the direction of the Yongjeong-ri People's Committee, meaning that after the basket was full of chestnuts, they would be sent to the Yongjeong-ri People's Committee. After finding out who the chestnut tree belonged to, they would be sent to the owner's house. The old man listened and listened, and laughed heartily, nodding repeatedly and saying: "I understand, I understand." Then, he made a gesture, explaining that the chestnuts were from their family, and he was here today to pick chestnuts. The soldiers were overjoyed to know that the chestnuts belonged to the old man, and accelerated the speed of picking chestnuts. In a short while, the chestnuts filled the basket. The old man seemed very moved. He pulled the sleeve of one soldier, and then grabbed the arm of another soldier, asking the Volunteer Army soldiers to eat chestnuts. But no one ate them. The chestnuts filled the basket, and two soldiers carried them to the old man's house. The old man's mood became more and more excited, he raised his thumb, and said repeatedly: "Mao—Ze—Dong—Chinese People's Volunteers, good, good!"

    栗子树下
    戚治邦
    今年10月25日，是中国人民志愿军出国抗美援朝十周年纪念日。每逢这一伟大节日来临的时候，我就很自然而然地回忆起中朝两国人民军队并肩作战的战斗友谊，回忆起我们与朝鲜人民的深厚友谊。有一件事情使我终身难忘。
    1957年9月，深秋来到了朝鲜三八线上的伊川郡龙亭里（“郡”相当于我国的县，“里”相当于我国的乡）。山野开始脱下深绿色的夏装，披上了暗红色咖啡色的秋装。我志愿军某部九连与龙亭里人民住在同一条山沟里，相隔只二里来地。九连营房背后，有几棵栗子树，那累累丰硕的果实，比鸽子蛋还大，真令人喜爱。随着深秋的来临，栗子成熟了，一个个往地下掉，掉得满地皆是。九连的战士们每天上山进行战术作业，要往返四次经过栗子树下，每当经过的时候，大家的脸上都自然而然地堆满了笑容，不断地称赞说：“多好的栗子哇！今年准是个丰收年！”可是，谁也没想到弯下腰，捡一个栗子尝尝。每个战士的心坎里，都牢牢地记着毛主席“爱护朝鲜一山一水一草一木”的教导。
    日子一久，掉在地上的栗子越来越多，可不见人来收拾，大家都耽心栗子要腐烂损失了。不知是谁出的点子，把炊事房里的大箩筐放在树下，在树上贴了一张红纸，纸上写了三行端端正正的字：“爱护朝鲜人民一山一水一草一木！谁经这里，把栗子拾到箩筐里去，不要忘记。”十分引人注目。全连同志看了这张纸条，都说这主意好。自此以后，每当演习来回经过栗子树下的时候，每一个战士都停住脚步，弯下腰，把地上的栗子一个个捡到箩筐里。一天，正当战士们捡栗子的时候，一位六十多岁的朝鲜老大爷手拿布袋，来到了栗子树下。他看到树上贴的红纸条，瞧了又瞧，认了又认，不明白纸上写的什么。一个战士看见了，转过身来，一个字一个字念给老大爷听。老大爷还是摇摇头说不懂。那个战士用手指指正在拾栗子的同志，又做了个把栗子装满箩筐的手势，然后指着龙亭里人民委员会的方向，意思是说，等把栗子捡满了筐，就送到龙亭里人民委员会去。打听到栗树是谁家的，再送到主人家里去。老大爷听着听着，爽朗地笑了起来，连连点头说：“我的明白，我的明白。”接着，他打了个手势，说明栗子是他们家的，他今天就是来拾栗子的。战士们知道了栗子是老大爷家的，高兴极了，加快了拾栗子的速度。一会儿栗子就装满箩筐了。老大爷看来非常感动，他一会儿拉这个战士的衣袖，一会儿又攥那个战士的胳膊，要志愿军战士吃栗子。可是谁也没有吃。栗子装满了箩筐，两个战士抬着送到了老大爷的家里。老大爷的心情越来越激动，翘起大拇指，一连声地说：“毛—泽—东—中国人民志愿军，好，好！”
