Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: The Japanese people's struggle against military bases is developing in various forms throughout the country.

The Kanagawa Prefectural Federation of the Socialist Party of Japan decided yesterday to launch a broad mass movement to resolutely oppose the U.S. bringing nuclear-armed warships into Yokosuka Port in the prefecture.

U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Griffin declared yesterday that the U.S. military had decided to incorporate the nuclear missile-launching cruiser "Hornet" into the Seventh Fleet and planned to send it to the Yokosuka U.S. Naval Base.

The Kanagawa Prefectural Federation of the Socialist Party pointed out in its decision: "The U.S. military has already guaranteed not to bring nuclear weapons into Japan, but incorporating a missile cruiser into the Seventh Fleet is a serious problem. The Socialist Party resolutely opposes the entry of nuclear weapons." It also decided to lodge a serious protest with the government and U.S. military authorities. While opposing U.S. military bases, the Japanese people are also launching struggles against military bases of the Japanese army. According to reports, about 1,300 union members and representatives of mass organizations from Shimane and Tottori prefectures held a conference yesterday to oppose the Japanese Air Force's expansion of the local Miho base into a jet aircraft base and to mourn Inejiro Asanuma, who was murdered by reactionaries. The conference also decided to submit a letter of protest to the Japanese Prime Minister and the Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission.

Residents of Shijosuimachi in Kitakawachi County, Osaka Prefecture, opposed the town mayor because he supported the Japanese government's establishment of an atomic reactor for nuclear armament in the area. In the mayoral election held yesterday, the former mayor was defeated by the opposition candidate, Nobumoto Mimatsu, and was ousted.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: According to an announcement by a U.S. Navy spokesman in Yokosuka today, the U.S., disregarding the opposition of the Japanese people, had already brought the cruiser "Hornet," capable of launching nuclear weapons, into the Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan on the 15th.

Japanese Foreign Ministry officials claimed that the cruiser, which has been incorporated into the U.S. Seventh Fleet, did not need to undergo "prior consultation" with Japan under the provisions of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" because it "did not carry nuclear warheads."

Many mass organizations in the prefecture are launching movements to protest the entry of U.S. warships into Yokosuka Port.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The people of Yamato City, where the U.S. Atsugi Base is located, held a rally this afternoon to protest the damage caused by the noise of U.S. military aircraft. About 300 local students and young people participated in the rally.

The conference denounced the damage caused by the noise of U.S. jet aircraft. At the end of the conference, a resolution was passed demanding that the government and U.S. military authorities take immediate measures. After the meeting, participants held a demonstration march in Yamato City with placards. The conference also sent representatives to protest to the U.S. Atsugi Base authorities.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: Three representatives of residents of Yamato City visited the commander of the U.S. Air Force Base in Atsugi on the 16th and handed him a resolution demanding that immediate and effective measures be taken to reduce jet aircraft noise.

The noise from U.S. jet aircraft has made it impossible for nearby residents to live in peace, and recently has forced all 127 farming households in the Yamato City area to relocate.
