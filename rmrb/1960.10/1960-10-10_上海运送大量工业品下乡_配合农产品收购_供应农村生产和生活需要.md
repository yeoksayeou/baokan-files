Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, reported that Shanghai's commercial departments are closely coordinating with the current agricultural product procurement work, organizing the transport of large quantities of industrial products to the countryside to support the continued leap forward in agricultural production, and to meet the needs of farmers to further improve their lives after selling agricultural products. In the past two months or so, more than 250,000 tons of production materials and consumer goods have been transported to various places by rail and air.

Under the guidance of the idea of "taking agriculture as the foundation," Shanghai's commercial departments have greatly increased the supply of various agricultural production materials to various places this year. The total value of agricultural machinery, hardware tools, transportation and electrical equipment transferred out in the third quarter exceeded the highest supply quantity in the same period in previous years. More than 85% of the annual supply contract has been completed for motors, diesel engines, rubber hoses, flat rubber belts, tractors, and internal combustion engine parts needed for the "three autumns" production in the vast rural areas. In order to meet the needs of rural areas to engage in short-distance transportation, more than 500,000 sets of rickshaw inner tubes, outer tires, and more than 10 million yuan worth of rickshaw parts have been supplied during this period. Rice milling machines, rice hulling machines, cotton ginning machines, small steel mills, and other machinery for processing agricultural and sideline products are also being sent to the countryside in a steady stream. The quantity transferred out in the past two months or so is equivalent to 80% of the total quantity in the first three quarters of last year. This year, Shanghai has also supported the rural areas with a batch of samplers, rice thermometers, and cotton rapid moisture testers for storing grain and inspecting cotton quality.

In terms of daily necessities allocation and supply, the number of bicycles, iron-cased thermos bottles, flashlights, pens, rubber shoes, and thread gloves transferred out in the third quarter increased compared with the same period last year. In order to further meet the needs of farmers for daily-use small commodities, the relevant purchasing and supply stations recently held replenishment meetings and provided an additional 36 million yuan worth of general merchandise, cultural supplies, and medicines to the countryside, in addition to the originally scheduled third-quarter contract.

    上海运送大量工业品下乡
    配合农产品收购  供应农村生产和生活需要
    据新华社上海电　上海商业部门密切配合当前农产品收购工作，组织大量工业品下乡，支援农业生产继续跃进，满足农民出售农产品以后进一步改善生活的需要。最近两个多月来，通过铁路、航路运往各地的生产资料和生活用品已有二十五万多吨。
    上海商业部门在“以农业为基础”的思想指导下，今年供应各地的工业品中，各种农业生产资料大量增加。第三季度外调的农业机械、五金工具、交通电工器材的总值，超过历年同期的最高供应数量。广大农村“三秋”生产需要的电动机、柴油机、胶管、平胶带以及拖拉机、内燃机配件，已经完成全年供应合同的85％以上。为适应农村大搞短途运输需要，这一时期又供应了五十多万套力车内胎、外胎和价值一千多万元的力车零件。碾米机、砻谷机、轧花机、小钢磨等各种加工农副产品的机械也在源源下乡，近两个多月来调出的数量相当于去年头三个季度总量的八成。上海今年还支援了农村一批收藏粮食和检验棉花质量使用的分样器、米温计、棉花快速水份测定器等仪器。
    在日用品调拨供应方面，第三季度调出的自行车、铁壳热水瓶、电筒、钢笔、全胶鞋、线手套等，都比去年同期增加。为了进一步满足农民对日用小商品的需要，最近各有关采购供应站都召开了补货会议，在原订第三季度合同以外多拿出价值三千六百万元的日用百货、文化用品和医药用品，供应农村。
