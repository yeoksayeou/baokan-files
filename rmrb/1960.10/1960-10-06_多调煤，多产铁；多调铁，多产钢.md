Since the launch of the campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel, the situation on the industrial production, transportation, and capital construction fronts has been getting better and better, and the output of industrial products such as steel, iron, and coal has continued to rise steadily. In September, the output of steel, iron, and steel products in Anshan Iron and Steel, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places increased significantly compared with August. The quality of products has also improved, and the variety has increased. The consumption of pig iron and coke in many enterprises has also decreased significantly. These situations show that a new situation of substantial production increase has begun to take shape. In order to sustain this good situation on the steel production front, so as to better complete and overfulfill this year's steel production plan, all enterprises and regions undertaking the task of transferring coal must strive to increase the production of more and better coal and transfer more and better coal to support the substantial production increase of key iron production enterprises and regions. All enterprises and regions undertaking the task of transferring pig iron must strive to produce more and better pig iron and transfer more and better pig iron to support the substantial production increase of key steelmaking enterprises.

Coal is the raw material for ironmaking, and more coal can produce more iron. Iron is the raw material for steelmaking, and more iron can produce more steel. However, it is not enough to just produce more coal and more iron; it is also necessary to transfer more coal and more iron at the same time. The reason is easy to understand. Coal and iron are two different production systems. In one enterprise, it is still extremely rare to both mine coal and make iron. Even within the scope of a province, city, or autonomous region, the coal mining and ironmaking capabilities are also unbalanced. Many major coking coal mines often undertake the task of supplying the steel enterprises of several provinces. Therefore, coal must not only be transferred out of one's own enterprise, but also out of one's own region. The distribution of steelmaking and ironmaking capacities is also unbalanced. This imbalance exists within an enterprise and also within the scope of a province, city, or autonomous region. Of the 27.5 million tons of iron planned by the state this year, more than half are produced by thousands of small and medium-sized ironmaking plants distributed in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. Some key steelmaking enterprises rely on the support of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions for the pig iron they need. This shows how important it is to transfer coal and iron to key steel enterprises in a timely manner. The more and better coal and iron are transferred to key steel enterprises, the more and better iron and steel can be produced. All enterprises and regions undertaking the task of transferring coal and iron must focus on increasing transfer after grasping high yield. This is an important link that is related to completing and overfulfilling this year's steel production plan ahead of schedule, and it is also an important link to ensure the continued leap forward in industry and agriculture next year.

To transfer more coal and more iron, it is necessary to produce more; without producing more, it is impossible to transfer more. After increasing the production of iron and coal, it is also necessary to carry forward the communist style, first meeting the needs of outward transfer and first completing the planned tasks of outward transfer. Many enterprises and regions are doing this now, and this spirit of putting the overall situation first is worth greatly promoting. In socialist construction, every enterprise and every place, whether formulating production plans, determining construction projects, or formulating distribution plans, must put the needs of the overall situation first and the needs of the local area second, and proceed from the 650 million people everywhere. If the overall situation requires a substantial increase in the production of coal and iron, we will do everything possible to ensure a substantial increase, and strive to exceed and strive to advance the schedule. Increase production for the overall situation and save for the overall situation. With coal and iron, priority should be given to key areas before general areas, and priority should be given to external areas before internal areas, sacrificing oneself for the sake of the overall situation. This is taking care of the overall situation, and it is the principle of the whole country acting as a single chessboard.

The decisive fourth quarter has arrived. Let us promptly and fully implement concrete measures in accordance with the coal and iron outward transfer plan, transfer more coal and more iron, and ensure that we have a greater increase in steel production in the fourth quarter.

### 多调煤，多产铁；多调铁，多产钢

    多调煤，多产铁；多调铁，多产钢
    开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动以来，工业生产、交通运输和基本建设战线上的形势，越来越好，钢、铁、煤等工业产品产量，继续稳定上升。9月份，鞍钢、上海、天津、北京等地的钢、铁、钢材的产量，都比8月份有了大的增长，产品的质量也有所提高，品种也有增加；许多企业的生铁、焦炭的消耗量也有显著下降。这些情况说明，一个生产大幅度增长的新局面已经开始形成。为了把钢铁生产战线上的这个良好局面持续发展下去，以便更好地完成和超额完成今年的钢铁生产计划，所有担负外调煤炭任务的企业和地区，一定要争取增产更多更好的煤炭，调出更多更好的煤炭，支援重点产铁企业和地区的生产大幅度增长；所有担负外调生铁任务的企业和地区，一定要争取生产更多更好的生铁，调出更多更好的生铁，支援重点炼钢企业的生产大幅度增长。
    煤是炼铁的原料，多产煤才可以多产铁。铁是炼钢的原料，多产铁才可以多炼钢。但是，仅仅多产煤、多产铁还不行，必须同时多调煤，多调铁。道理是很容易明白的。煤和铁，是两个不同的生产系统。在一个企业里，又采煤，又炼铁的，至今还是极少的。就是在一个省、市或自治区范围内，采煤和炼铁能力，也是不平衡的。许多主要的生产焦煤的煤矿，往往担负着供应好几个省的钢铁企业的任务。所以，煤炭不只要调出自己企业，还要调出自己的地区。炼钢和炼铁能力的分布，也是不平衡的。这种不平衡，在一个企业内存在，在一个省、市、自治区范围内也存在。今年国家计划生产的二千七百五十万吨铁中，有一半以上是由分布在全国各省、市、自治区的成千个中小型炼铁厂生产的。一部分重点炼钢企业所需要的生铁是靠各个省、市、自治区的支援。这就说明及时地把煤和铁调给重点钢铁企业多么重要。给重点钢铁企业调的煤和铁越多、越好，就越能炼出更多更好的铁和钢来。所有担负外调煤、铁任务的企业和地区，在抓高产之后，必须抓多调。这是关系着提前完成和超额完成今年钢铁生产计划的一个重要环节，也是保证明年工农业继续跃进的重要一环。
    要多调煤、多调铁，必须多生产，不多生产就不可能多调。增产了铁，增产了煤，还要发扬共产主义风格，首先满足外调需要，首先完成外调计划任务。现在许多企业和地区都是这样做的，这种把全局放在第一位的精神，值得大大发扬。在社会主义建设中，每一个企业、每一个地方，无论是制订生产计划、确定建设项目，或者是制订分配计划，都要把全局需要放在第一位，把局部需要放在第二位，处处从六亿五千万人口出发。全局需要大幅度增产煤和铁，就千方百计地保证大幅度增产，而且争取超过，争取提前。为全局而增产，为全局而节约。有了煤，有了铁，先重点后一般，先外后内，克己为全局。这就是照顾全局观点，就是全国一盘棋原则。
    决定性的第四季度已经到来了，让我们及时地、充分地按照煤铁外调计划，切切实实采取具体措施，多调煤、多调铁，保证我们在第四季度的钢铁生产有一个更大幅度的增长。
