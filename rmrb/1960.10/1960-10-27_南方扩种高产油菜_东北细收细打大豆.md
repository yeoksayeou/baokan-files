Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Southern provinces and cities are seizing the season to sow rapeseed. The rapeseed seedling cultivation in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shanghai and other places has basically ended.

This autumn, southern provinces and cities, while ensuring the sowing area of ​​food crops and the production of the first season of next year, are actively expanding the rapeseed sowing area and increasing the planting of high-yield "Victory Rapeseed," striving to achieve multiple harvests and high-yield multiple harvests. Hunan Province mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of intercropping, interplanting, and planting rapeseed on mountains and in winter-flooded fields, making full use of the land and rationally arranging planting plans, solving the contradiction between grain and oil competing for land and the mutual influence of crops in the upper and lower seasons. The lakefront area of ​​this province also actively reclaims wasteland to plant a season of rapeseed. In order to plant more and better Victory Rapeseed, Anhui Province vigorously promoted the method of square-block seedling transplanting of rapeseed this year. According to experiments, the square-block seedling method saves land, seeds, labor, and fertilizer compared to direct sowing, and can be planted and mature earlier, which can solve the contradiction of grain and oil competing for land.

The rapeseed sowing work in various places this year was prepared earlier. Many people's communes, based on the experience of increased production from early planting over the years, began sowing and seedling cultivation around the "Autumn Equinox." Sichuan Province, one of the main producing areas, mobilized the masses to summarize rapeseed production experience after the summer harvest, preparing base fertilizer and selecting fine seeds for rapeseed, and the sowing time was generally advanced by a season compared to previous years. Songzi County, Hubei Province, started sowing in August and had sown 150,000 mu by the end of September. Many communes held training courses to train sowing technicians and organized inspection and acceptance teams to ensure the quality of sowing with inspection and acceptance.

Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The soybean harvesting work in the three northeastern provinces has ended, and they are stepping up threshing and warehousing.

Timely harvesting and meticulous harvesting are the common characteristics of soybean harvesting in these three provinces this year. The people's communes have adopted various measures to strive for every grain to be returned to the granary, in light of the characteristics of early soybean maturity, strong harvesting seasonality, and easy pod bursting and grain dropping. Heilongjiang Province, while harvesting field crops, made arrangements for meticulous soybean harvesting, so that the quality of soybean harvesting exceeded that of previous years. This province had more rain this year, and the maturity of soybeans varied. The soybeans grew with thick stalks and many grains, and the amount of labor for harvesting was large. Therefore, the people's communes and production teams were composed of members with good skills and strong physical strength to form specialized harvesting teams to ensure that the harvesting was fast and good. The production teams of the people's communes in Jilin Province arranged the harvesting time block by block according to the maturity of soybeans, achieving one block to be harvested when ripe. Many people's communes in Baicheng area also formulated operating procedures, leaving stubble no more than an inch when cutting beans; cutting on cloudy days and mornings, transporting on sunny days and afternoons; laying mats on transport vehicles and putting mouth covers on horses to avoid scattering. All parts of Liaoning Province have also changed the habit of harvesting grain fields first and then soybean fields in previous years, making reasonable arrangements, implementing grain and soybeans harvesting together, achieving timely harvesting, and fast and meticulous harvesting.

Various places have also organized auxiliary labor to participate in re-harvesting, and in the soybean fields that have been carefully harvested, they have picked pods and grains block by block. This year, soybean stalks and leaves were also cleaned up completely.

Since the beginning of harvesting, all localities have paid attention to removing impurities and improving the quality of soybeans. The people's communes in Changchun and Siping areas of Jilin Province have generally achieved good binding and drying, small piles covered on top, threshing and winnowing at the same time, fine selection and impurity removal, warehouse padding at the bottom, and leak-proof and moisture-proof. The soybeans sent to the state warehouses in Huaide County all meet the warehousing standards. (Attached picture)

This year, the Youting Commune in Dazu County, Sichuan, planted rapeseed more than a month earlier, and has now generally applied top dressing once. This is a member applying top dressing to rapeseed. Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Zhongjing photographed.

    南方扩种高产油菜  东北细收细打大豆
    新华社26日讯　南方各省、市正抓紧季节播种油菜。云南、贵州、四川、上海等地的油菜育苗工作已基本结束。
    今秋南方各省、市在保证粮食作物播种面积和明年头季生产的原则下，都积极扩大油菜播种面积，并且增种高产的“胜利油菜”，力争达到多种多收和高产多收。湖南省发动群众总结间种、套种和油菜上山、改冬浸田种油菜等经验，充分利用土地，合理安排种植计划，解决了粮油争地和上下季作物相互影响的矛盾。这个省的滨湖地区，还大垦湖荒来种一季油菜。为了多种和种好胜利油菜，安徽省今年大力推广了油菜方块育苗移栽的办法。据试验，方块育苗法比起点播来要省地、省种、省工、省肥，能早栽早熟，可以解决粮油争地的矛盾。
    各地今年的油菜播种工作准备得比较早。许多人民公社根据历年早种增产的经验，在“秋分”前后就开始了播种育苗工作。主要产区之一的四川省，夏收后就发动群众总结油菜生产经验，为油菜准备基肥、精选良种，播种时间一般比往年适当提早一个季节。湖北省松滋县在8月份开始播种，到9月末就播种了十五万亩。许多公社举办训练班，培训播种技术人员，组织检查验收小组，做到随播随检查，保证了播种质量。
    新华社26日讯　东北三省大豆收割工作已经结束，正抓紧脱粒入仓。
    适时收、细致收，是今年这三个省收获大豆的共同特点。各人民公社针对大豆成熟早、收获时间性强、容易爆荚落粒等特性，采取了各种措施来力争粒粒归仓。黑龙江省在收割大田作物的同时，就对精收细收大豆作了安排，使大豆收获质量超过往年。这个省今年雨多，大豆成熟期参差不齐，大豆长得秆粗多粒，收割用工量大，因此各人民公社、生产队都由技术好、体力壮的社员组成收割专业队，保证收割得又快又好。吉林省各人民公社的生产队按照大豆成熟期逐块安排了收割时间，做到了熟一块割一块，白城地区许多人民公社还制定了操作规程，割豆留茬不过寸；阴天和早晨割，晴天和下午运；拉运车铺席，打场马带兜嘴，以免抛撒。辽宁省各地也改变了历年先收粮田、后收豆田的习惯，合理安排，实行粮、豆一齐收，做到了收割适时，收快收细。
    各地还组织辅助劳力参加复收，在经过细收的豆田里，又逐块逐垅拾荚拣粒。今年豆秸、豆叶也收拾得干干净净。
    各地从收割开始，就注意清除杂质，提高大豆质量。吉林省长春、四平地区各人民公社普遍做到捆好晒干、小垛盖顶、随打随扬、精选除杂、仓库垫底、防漏防潮。怀德县已送入国家仓库的大豆全部合于入库标准。（附图片）
