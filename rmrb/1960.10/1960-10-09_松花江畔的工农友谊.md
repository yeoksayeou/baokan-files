    Worker-Peasant Friendship on the Banks of the Songhua River
    By our reporter Zhao Yuqing

    In mid-September, we traversed the Songliao Plain and arrived at the upper reaches of the Songhua River, where we witnessed the vigorous industrial support for agriculture movement.

    Jilin, the largest city in the upper reaches of the Songhua River, is known by local farmers as a "treasure gourd." In this city, ingenious chemists use the most common raw materials to create white granular ammonium nitrate fertilizer. In the fields, every jin (0.5 kg) of ammonium nitrate applied can increase rice production by five to six jin, cotton by three to four jin, and potatoes by thirty to thirty-five jin. Workers at the Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant use limestone to refine calcium carbide, and then use calcium carbide to produce calcium cyanamide, which can eliminate weeds in cotton fields; when the cotton bolls are ripening, scattering it in the cotton fields can cause the cotton leaves to fall off, facilitating machine harvesting. Jilin City also boasts a strong power industry and some mechanical industries. All of this makes this city the center of the industrial support for agriculture movement in the Songhua River basin.

    When we arrived in Jilin City, the city's support for agriculture movement had already entered its fourth upsurge. Whenever a busy farming season is about to arrive, Jilin City launches a high tide of support for agriculture. Last winter was the first upsurge, and this year's spring plowing and summer weeding were the second and third upsurges. Now the harvest season has arrived on both sides of the Songhua River, and another upsurge of support has begun. The ebb and flow of these movements allowed us to witness firsthand the close relationship between urban and rural people in this area.

    Most of the workers in Jilin City come from the countryside, and they have experienced firsthand that agriculture is the "root" of the national economy. After the Jilin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call for supporting agricultural technical transformation last November, every factory and every worker in the city regarded supporting agriculture as a top priority. Factories included agricultural support products as an important item in their production plans; workers also kept supporting agriculture in mind when arranging their lives. Several workers at the Jilin Paper Mill picked up scrap iron nails near the factory every day, accumulated them, packed them into several boxes, and sent them to the countryside. When the people of the city went to visit the communes, the nursery workers at the Jilin Paper Mill were very anxious. They could not leave the children to go to the communes. Several nursery workers held a meeting and came up with a solution: each of them collected some flower cloth scraps and small pieces of wood at home, and made dozens of cloth dolls and wooden toys to send to the commune nurseries. When the cooks in the cafeteria learned about this, they immediately took action and rushed to make a vegetable cutter overnight, which they loaded onto the visiting group's vehicle the next day to be taken to the commune cafeteria.

    A vigorous mass movement is like a fierce storm. In the industrial support for agriculture movement in the Jilin area, if the iron nails, manure, toys, and vegetable cutters are small waves, then the upsurge in production on the industrial front to produce more products for the countryside is a huge wave. In the huge factory area of the Jilin Chemical Industrial Zone, we witnessed a heart-stirring upsurge in fertilizer production.

    In order to produce more high-quality fertilizers for the peasant brothers, the Jilin Fertilizer Plant has launched thirteen major campaigns since the beginning of this year. Each campaign has increased the production of tens of thousands of tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, raising fertilizer production to a new level. During our visit to Jilin, the fertilizer plant launched its fourteenth major campaign. In order to create the highest production record in history, the entire factory sent more than 500 veterans and elite soldiers to the front line during this campaign. Workshop directors, section chiefs, and shift leaders took off their cadres' uniforms, put on their work clothes, and went to operate the tall, dark gas generators and the huge, complex air separation equipment. The huge factory area was like a magical world. The chemists manipulated various furnaces, towers, pumps, and tanks to separate oxygen and nitrogen from the air, burn solid coal into hot gas, and extract hydrogen from the water. Finally, snowy white and crystalline ammonium nitrate fertilizer, like dense snowflakes, drifted down from the towering granulation tower.

    The slogan resounding throughout the fertilizer plant is: "One jin of ammonium nitrate, five jin of grain"; "Time is ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate is grain." Inside the plant, no matter which workshop you walk into, you will see the corridors are filled with workers' letters of determination to support agriculture and poems praising worker-peasant friendship. One of the poems reads:

    Support agriculture with a great leap forward,
    A handful of ammonium nitrate, a handful of silver;
    Stir up a thousand layers of wheat sea,
    Float out ten thousand miles of rice fragrance.

    In Jilin, the manufacture of agricultural implements has a particularly moving scene. In the past, Jilin City had almost no fully-fledged agricultural machinery manufacturing plant. However, after the slogan of supporting agriculture became a household name, the entire city of Jilin became a huge agricultural machinery "manufacturing plant." You can travel all over the city and hardly find a factory that has not manufactured agricultural implements. The carpenters at the construction site of the Jilin Chemical Industrial Zone used the scrap wood left over from erecting beams and installing doors and windows to make seeders and rice threshers in their spare time. Qin Shiliang, a national model worker and engineer from the Jilin Paper Mill, led a group of stonemasons to manufacture corn threshers. During this year's spring plowing and the current harvest season, tens of thousands of rice transplanters, seeders, double-wheeled double-share plows, shovel cultivators, threshers, and winnowing machines have been produced from the workshops of the Jilin Chemical Industrial Zone with its crisscrossing pipes, from the machine repair shops under the blast furnaces of the Jiangnan Steel Plant, from the rice husk piles of the Jilin Grain Processing Plant, and from the small houses of the commune-run industries. Yao Yongtian, an old engineer from the Jilin Railway Bureau, is a 62-year-old man who retired last year. During the upsurge of manufacturing autumn harvest tools, he couldn't stay idle at home. He took out his tools and slide rule from the box, followed the technical service team to the Chengjiao People's Commune in Huadian County, found more than 20 young commune members as apprentices, and guided them in repairing and manufacturing agricultural implements. The Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant is far from the mountains and cannot find wood, so it manufactured many iron parts such as bearings, shafts, tile sleeves, and screws, and sent workers by steamer to the Tiannan People's Commune on the shore of Songhua Lake. The Tiannan Commune is a mountainous area with an inexhaustible supply of wood. The commune members made their own wooden parts, and assembled them with the iron parts made by the calcium carbide plant to make more than 100 rice threshers, grain threshers, weed cutters, water turbines, and winnowing machines. Commune member Qiu Jilin looked at a rice thresher, unable to contain his inner joy, and said excitedly: "The factory's ironwork and the commune's woodwork are the product of the worker-peasant alliance, it should be named 'Alliance Brand'."

    Jilin, a city full of deep affection and friendship between workers and peasants, is praised by farmers in the surrounding hundreds of miles. In June of this year, more than 500 mu of sorghum, corn, and rice fields in the Tiannan Commune were short of fertilizer, and the seedlings were short and small. After the workers of the Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant learned about this, they extracted 70,000 jin of ammonium sulfate fertilizer from the waste gas of coke production, and sent people by boat day and night to Tiannan, and scattered it in the fields. Seven days later, the seedlings improved. Now, the crops are tall, the ears are big and full, and they are about to be harvested. The commune members invited the workers of the calcium carbide plant to the fields, opened up the golden rice waves, and broke open the foot-long corn cobs, and analyzed the reasons for this year's bumper harvest, saying: The first reason for this year's bumper harvest should be attributed to the leadership of the Party, and the second reason should be attributed to the support of the worker elder brothers.

    Facing the colorful autumn fields, we walked out of the urban area of Jilin, crossed the Songhua River, Aolong River, and Yak River, crossed one mountain after another, and walked from one commune to another, and everywhere we saw many results of industrial support for agriculture. The beautiful fishing villages on the shore of Songhua Lake, with the help of the Fengman Power Station, have established hydropower stations and hydrodynamic stations. The remote Jiaohe mountainous area, with the help of Jilin Chemical Industrial Company, has established machinery factories, wood factories, chemical factories and fertilizer factories. Now, more than 80% of the people's communes in the Jilin area are equipped with "two beds" or "three beds" (lathe, planer, drill press) and "five tools" (taps, dies, vices, hacksaw, steel file, hand drill), and some communes are even equipped with nine lathes. A hundred and ten management districts in the region have achieved low-standard electrification and have begun to use electricity for threshing, hulling, and milling, and electric lights have been lit in the homes of commune members. The Chaludahe People's Commune, 120 miles away from Jilin City, used to have to drive into the city in the middle of the night to repair agricultural implements. Now, with a machine factory with five lathes, it can not only repair small agricultural implements, but also repair tractors, and manufacture seeders, universal harrows, new-style paddy field weeders, threshers, and power rice threshers. The five hundred miles of plains and mountainous areas in the upper reaches of the Songhua River are striding towards the modernization of agriculture. (Attached picture)

    The Xingfu Road People's Commune used the waste materials supported by the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company to produce a batch of electric rice threshers. This is being transported to the production team, ready for threshing.

    松花江畔的工农友谊
    本报记者　赵玉庆
    9月中旬，我们穿过松辽平原，来到松花江上游，看到了这里轰轰烈烈的工业支援农业运动。
    松花江上游最大的城市吉林，被当地农民称作“宝葫芦”。在这个城市里，巧妙的化工们用最常见的原料，造出白色颗粒状的肥料硝铵。在农田上，每施用一斤硝铵，可以增产水稻五斤至六斤，棉花三斤至四斤，马铃薯三十斤至三十五斤。吉林电石厂的工人们用石灰石炼制电石，又用电石制造氰氨化钙，氰氨化钙可以消除棉田的莠草；在棉桃成熟期间，撒到棉田里，可以使棉叶脱落，便于机器收获。吉林市还拥有强大的电力工业和一些机械工业。这一切，使这个城市成为松花江流域工业支援农业运动的中心。
    我们来到吉林市的时候，这个城市的支援农业运动已经进入第四个高潮了。每当一个农忙季节将要到来的时候，吉林市就掀起一个支援农业高潮。去年冬季是第一次高潮，今年春耕和夏锄是第二次和第三次高潮。现在收获季节来到了松花江两岸，又一次支援高潮开始了。浪潮起伏，使我们亲眼看到了这一带城乡人民的亲密关系。
    吉林市的大部分工人来自农村，他们从自己的亲身经历中体验到农业是国民经济的“根子”。去年11月，中共吉林市委发出了支援农业技术改造的号召以后，全市每一家工厂、每一个工人，都把支援农业当成头等要事。工厂制定生产计划时，把支援农业的产品列为重要一项；工人安排生活时，也念念不忘支援农业。吉林造纸厂有几名工人，每天在厂区附近拣废铁钉，积累起来，装成几箱，送到农村。在全市人民纷纷前往公社访问的时候，吉林造纸厂托儿所的保育员十分焦急，她们无法离开孩子到公社去，几个保育员开个会，想个办法，每人回家搜集一些花布边和碎木块，做了几十个布娃娃和木制玩具，送给公社托儿所。食堂炊事员知道这件事以后，也立刻行动起来，连夜赶制了一台切菜机，第二天装到访问团的车上，让访问团的同志带给公社食堂。
    一次轰轰烈烈的群众运动，如同一场猛烈的风暴。在吉林地区的工业支援农业运动中，如果说，铁钉、粪肥、玩具、切菜机的事情是微波细浪的话，那么，工业战线为了给农村生产更多的产品而掀起的增产热潮，就是巨波大浪了。我们在吉林化工区的巨大厂区里，就看到了一场震人心弦的增产肥料的热潮。
    为了给农民兄弟生产更多的优质化肥，吉林肥料厂今年以来开展了十三次大会战。每一次会战都增产出成千上万吨硝铵肥料，都把肥料生产提高到一个新的水平。在我们访问吉林期间，肥料厂又掀起了第十四次大会战。为了创造历史上最高的生产纪录，在这次会战中，全厂把五百多名老将和精兵派到第一线。车间主任、工段长、值班长们脱下干部服，穿上操作服，去操纵高大黝黑的造气炉和庞大复杂的空气分离装置。巨大的厂区，俨然如一个神奇的世界。化工们操纵着各种炉、塔、泵、罐，把空气中的氧和氮分离开来，把固体的煤炭燃成炽热的气体，把水中的氢取出来。最后，雪白晶莹的硝铵肥料，像浓密的雪花一样，永不停歇地从高耸入云的造粒塔顶飘然而下。
    响彻肥料厂的口号是：“一斤硝铵，五斤粮食”；“时间就是硝铵，硝铵就是粮食”。在厂内，随便走进哪个车间，都看到走廊上贴满工人们支援农业的决心书和歌颂工农友谊的诗歌。其中一首诗写道：
    支援农业大跃进，
    一把硝铵一把银；
    掀起麦海千层浪，
    飘出万里稻花香。
    在吉林，农具的制造别有一番动人的景象。过去，吉林市几乎没有一个成型的农业机械制造厂。但是，在支援农业的口号家喻户晓之后，吉林全城就变成了一个巨大的农业机械“制造厂”。你走遍全城，几乎找不到一个没有制造过农具的工厂。吉林化工区建筑工地的木匠们，在工作之余，用架设房梁和安装门窗剩下的废木料，制造了播种机和打稻机。全国著名的劳动模范、吉林造纸厂工人出身的工程师秦士亮领着一批石匠，制造了玉米脱粒机。在今年春耕期间和眼前的收获季节，从管道纵横的吉林化工区的车间里，从江南钢铁厂高炉下的机修间里，从吉林市粮谷加工厂的稻壳堆旁，从社办工业的矮小民房里，生产出数以万计的插秧机、播种机、双轮双铧犁、铲趟机、打谷机和扬场机。吉林铁路局工人出身的老工程师姚永田，是一位六十二岁的老人，去年已经退休了。在制造秋收工具的高潮中，他在家闲不住，从箱子里翻出刀具和计算尺，跟随技术服务队，来到桦甸县城郊人民公社，找了二十多名青年社员做徒弟，指导他们修造农具。吉林电石厂离山区远，找不到木材，就制造了许多轴承、轴杠、瓦套、螺丝等铁制部件，派工人坐汽船送到松花湖畔的天南人民公社。天南公社是山区，有取之不尽的木材，公社社员自己作木件，和电石厂作的铁件装配在一起，制成一百多部打稻机、脱谷机、乱草机、水轮机、扬场机。社员丘聚霖望着一台打稻机，抑制不住内心的喜悦，兴奋地说：“工厂的铁活，公社的木活，这是工农联盟的产物，应该起个名，叫‘联盟牌’”。
    吉林，这座工农之间满怀深情厚谊的城市，得到周围几百里农村农民的赞扬。今年6月，天南公社的五百多亩高粱、玉米和稻田，由于缺肥，秧苗矮小。吉林电石厂的工人们知道以后，从生产焦炭的废气中提炼出七万斤硫铵肥料，派人星夜乘船送到天南，撒到地里，七天以后，秧苗好转。现在，这片庄稼秧棵高大，穗大粒饱，就要开镰收割了。社员们把电石厂的工人请到地里，拨开金黄色的稻浪，掰开一尺来长的玉米棒，分析今年丰收的原因说：今年的丰收，第一条应该归功于党的领导，第二条应该归功于工人老大哥的支援。
    我们迎着五光十色的秋季原野，走出吉林市区，跨过松花江、鳌龙河、牦牛河，越过一个山峦又一个山峦，从一个公社走到另一个公社，到处都看到许多工业支援农业的工作成果。松花湖畔的美丽渔村，在丰满电站的帮助下，建立了水电站和水动力站。偏僻的蛟河山区，在吉林化学工业公司的帮助下，建立了机械厂、木器厂、化工厂和化肥厂。现在，吉林地区80％以上的人民公社，装备了“两床”或“三床”（车床、刨床、钻床）“五具”（丝锥板牙、老虎钳子、钢锯、钢锉、手摇钻），有的公社甚至装备了九台车床。全地区有一百一十个管理区实现了低标准电气化，开始用电力打场、脱谷、碾米，社员家里点上了电灯。离吉林市一百二十里的岔路河人民公社，过去修理农具，要半夜套车进城，现在，有了五台车床的机械厂，不仅可以修理小农具，还可以修理拖拉机，制造播种机、万能?耙、新式水田锄草机、脱谷机、动力打稻机。松花江上游的五百里平原和山区，正在朝着农业现代化的方向阔步前进。（附图片）
    幸福之路人民公社利用吉林化学工业公司支援的废料制出一批电动打稻机，这是正往生产队运送，准备打稻。
