    Grasp the key. This sentence is familiar to everyone. But to truly achieve this in our work is not an easy task. Therefore, we cannot regard it as a cliché, but must seriously value this leadership thought and leadership method. Today, this newspaper publishes two news items from the Anhui Provincial Party Committee's Steel Plant and the Yunnan Yipinglang Coal Mine, which illustrate the importance of grasping the key with the facts of production leaps forward.

    In our production, we constantly encounter many problems that need to be solved. If they are solved in a timely and thorough manner, production can leap forward; otherwise, the development of production will be hindered. But there are so many problems in front of us, how do we start? This depends on whether you can grasp the key issues and the main contradictions. Chairman Mao said in "On Contradiction": "In studying any process, if there is a complex process involving more than two contradictions, we must use all our efforts to find its principal contradiction. Once this principal contradiction is grasped, all problems will be readily solved."

    To grasp the key, we must grasp it accurately. To truly find the key issues, we must conduct thorough and serious investigation and research in reality. It is impossible to rely solely on temporary "inspiration." The news from the two factories mentioned above tells us that in order to achieve a production leap forward, everyone went to find the key. But you say this, he says that, where exactly is the key? We need to find it at the production site. But even if we go deep into the site, we cannot see the key at a glance. The main thing is to rely on the masses and mobilize everyone to find it in order to find the key. Zhou Aocheng and other workshop leaders were determined to conduct investigation and research to find the key. Nothing is difficult in this world for those who put their heart into it. The key was finally found by them.

    Once the key is grasped, it must be pursued to the end, and the problem must be solved quickly and thoroughly. It cannot be just a general arrangement. After Zhou Aocheng and other comrades grasped the key issue, they first studied the relevant technical data, further clarified the problem, made a scientific judgment, and proposed a preliminary solution to the problem; then, in order to gather ideas, they convened a meeting of representatives of the entire workshop to study this issue. Even then, it wasn't implemented. They first built a furnace to conduct experiments. As a result, production gave them a satisfactory answer. Facts prove that they grasped the key to production and solved the problem of developing production.

    On the other hand, from the same example, we can also see that simply solving problems and subjective and one-sided approaches will definitely be counterproductive, unable to promote production, but instead cause production losses. This is because, in order to extend the furnace life, the furnace lining was arbitrarily thickened, and in order to pursue output, more molten iron was loaded beyond the limit. Objective facts are relentless to people. Whoever conforms to its laws will succeed, and whoever violates the laws will fail. Therefore, what people learn from practice includes both successful experiences and lessons learned from failure.

    In short, to grasp the key, we must go deep into the forefront of production; to go deep into the forefront of production, the primary task must also be to grasp the key. There are only two months left this year. To ensure and over fulfill the national plan, we must firmly grasp the key to increased production and solve problems quickly and thoroughly, so that production can continue to leap forward.

    抓关键
    王瑞
    抓关键，这句话，大家听来并不生疏。可是在工作里要真能做到这点，却不是一件轻而易举的事。所以，不能把它看成是老生常谈，要严肃地重视这个领导思想和领导方法。今天本报发表安徽省委机关钢铁厂和云南一平浪煤矿的两条消息，就以生产跃进的事实，说明了抓关键的重要性。
    在我们生产中，不断遇到很多问题，要我们去解决。解决得及时、彻底，生产就能跃进，相反，生产的发展就要受到阻碍。可是摆在面前的问题这样多，怎么下手呢？这就要看你能不能抓住关键问题，抓住主要矛盾。毛主席在“矛盾论”里说：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”
    抓关键，就要抓得准，真能找到关键性的问题，就非深入实际认真作一番调查研究不可，单靠一时的“灵感”是办不到的。上述两个厂的消息中就讲到，为了生产跃进，大家都去找关键。可是你说这个，他说那个，究竟关键何在呢？要到生产现场里去找。但深入了现场，也不是一眼就能看到关键的。主要是要依靠群众，发动大家来找，才能找出关键来。周敖成和其他车间领导同志下决心进行调查研究，找关键。天下无难事，只怕有心人，关键终于被他们找出来了。
    抓住关键，就要一抓到底，迅速、彻底地解决问题，不能只是一般地安排安排就算了。周敖成等同志抓住关键问题后，先研究了有关的技术资料，把问题进一步弄清楚，作了科学的判断，提出解决问题的初步方案；又为了集思广益召集了全车间代表会议研究这个问题，做到这里，还没落实，他们又先搞起个炉子来进行试验。结果，生产给了他们圆满的回答，事实证明，他们是抓住了生产的关键，解决了发展生产的问题。
    另一方面，从这同一个事例里，我们还能看到，简单地解决问题和主观片面的作法，一定会事与愿违，不能促进生产，反而造成生产上的损失。这就是为延长炉龄，任意把炉衬加厚，和为追求产量就超过限度的多装铁水。客观事实对人是毫不客气的，谁符合它的规律就走得通，谁违反了规律，就会失败。所以，人们从实践中学来的，有成功的经验也有失败的教训。
    总之，要抓关键，就必须深入生产第一线；深入生产第一线，首要的任务也必须抓关键。今年只有两个月了，要保证和超额完成国家计划，就要狠抓增产的关键，迅速、彻底地解决问题，生产就一定能持续跃进。
