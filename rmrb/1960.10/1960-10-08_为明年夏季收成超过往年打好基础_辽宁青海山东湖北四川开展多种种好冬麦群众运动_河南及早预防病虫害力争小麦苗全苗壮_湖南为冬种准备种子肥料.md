    To lay a solid foundation for next year’s summer harvest to surpass previous years, Liaoning, Qinghai, Shandong, Hubei and Sichuan are carrying out various mass campaigns to plant winter wheat well. Henan is preventing plant diseases and pests early to strive for full and strong wheat seedlings. Hunan is preparing seeds and fertilizer for winter planting.

    Liaoning
    According to Xinhua News Agency, rural people's communes in Liaoning province are launching mass campaigns to plant more winter wheat and plant it well while carrying out the autumn harvest, striving to transform more land from one crop per year to two crops per year. According to recent statistics, the area sown with winter wheat in the province has more than doubled compared to the same period last year.
    Expanding the area sown with winter wheat is a major innovation in Liaoning's cultivation system. In the past, only a few areas in the province had the custom of planting winter wheat. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, cities and counties have continuously experimented with double cropping of wheat and rice or wheat and grain (including corn, millet, sorghum, sweet potatoes, etc.) in some land. As a result, they have not only made full use of the land's fertility but also avoided the flood season, resulting in relatively stable harvests and a general increase of about 50%. Based on the experience of the past two years, before "White Dew" this year, all cities and counties have organized forces, adopting the method of harvesting, preparing the land, transporting manure, and sowing at the same time to actively sow winter wheat. Before sowing, people's communes in the Dalian area made full preparations in terms of organization, materials, and technology, and implemented the plans and measures for sowing winter wheat at all levels. The sown area is about three times larger than last year. Jinzhou, Shenyang, and Anshan, which have later seasons and rarely grow wheat in the past, are also vigorously rushing to plant winter wheat.

    Qinghai
    According to Xinhua News Agency, agricultural areas in Qinghai Province are seizing the opportunity to expand the planting of winter wheat. The area already sown in counties under the jurisdiction of Xining City has quadrupled compared to last year; the sown area in other counties has also increased significantly compared to last year.
    Qinghai is one of China's main spring-sown crop areas, and most crops are concentrated in spring sowing. Therefore, expanding the area sown with winter wheat plays a significant role in resolving the contradiction of busy farm work and tight labor during the spring sowing season. In this way, it is possible to gain time and free up hands to complete the spring sowing tasks in a timely manner. At the same time, winter wheat matures earlier and can be harvested earlier, which is convenient for intercropping. In order to complete the wheat sowing task in a timely manner, people's communes in various places have transferred part of the manpower and animal power to carry out deep plowing, fertilization, and seed selection after the spring wheat harvest. Recently, with the basic completion of wheat harvesting and threshing, people's communes in various places have strengthened the autumn sowing force and strived to plant more and better winter wheat.

    Shandong
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Shandong is seizing the opportunity after the rain to vigorously rush to plant wheat. Since September 24, Shandong has generally experienced rainfall, with large amounts of rain in some areas. Although rainfall is less in some areas, it is generally above ten millimeters. In order to take advantage of soil moisture to sow wheat, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued an emergency notice on the 27th, requiring all localities to seize the opportunity to sow. Party committees at all levels immediately took action. Some areas suspended all work that could be temporarily suspended and concentrated more than 90% of the labor, animal power, plows, harrows, drills, sowing machines, and vehicles of all sizes to carry out manure delivery, plowing, and sowing at the same time. Leading cadres at all levels in Fanxian County have gone deep into the fields to participate in the rush planting. Guo Shenglu, Secretary of the County Party Committee Secretariat, went deep into the production teams to specifically help arrange labor, animal power, tools, and methods of rush planting; County Magistrate Pang Zhenjiang rushed to the Shibalipu Commune in the rain to help the commune hold an emergency meeting and specifically deploy rush planting measures.

    Hubei
    According to Xinhua News Agency, by the end of September, Hubei Province had sown more than 5 million mu of wheat, barley, rapeseed, and bean crops, exceeding the sown area of any year in history. Wuhan, Jingzhou, Huanggang, and other areas that have always had few autumn-sown crops have also significantly expanded the autumn-sown area this year, with many counties expanding it by about one time.
    In order to achieve higher yields and greater harvests, various localities are expanding the area and also starting early to deeply plow and prepare the land, accumulate and transport fertilizer, prepare seeds and sowing tools to ensure timely sowing and fast and good sowing. Xiangyang area seized the opportunity to deeply plow the soil while reclaiming wasteland to prepare fertilizer for autumn planting. Suixian County organized a large amount of labor and animal power during the harvest of mid-season rice to deeply plow and level the autumn planting land at the same time.
    Cadres at all levels have gone deep into the front line to participate in and lead production. All walks of life in the province have also supported autumn plowing and sowing from all aspects.

    Sichuan
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Sichuan has summed up the experience of planting early-maturing spring crops over the years and decided to seize the favorable opportunity before and after "Frost's Descent" to mobilize the masses to plant early-maturing spring crops in a big way. At present, the planting plan for early-maturing spring crops has been implemented to the teams and fields. The preparation of materials such as fertilizer, seeds, and tools needed for planting early-maturing spring crops is also actively underway.
    After summing up the benefits of planting spring crops, which can regulate labor, animal power, and tools, improve land utilization, help arrange the lives of the masses during the period of grain shortage in the spring and summer, and increase the green fodder for livestock with spring by-products, various localities have expanded the planned planting area of spring crops. Many people's communes in Nanchong, Neijiang, Wanxian, and Mianyang areas immediately launched a mass campaign to plant early-maturing spring crops after the mid-season rice was basically harvested and threshed at the end of September. After national discussions, Wanxian decided to increase the early-maturing spring crops by 170,000 mu, and mass sowing has now begun.

    Henan
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Henan is taking measures to prevent wheat diseases, induce and kill underground insects, and strive for full, uniform, and strong wheat seedlings next year.
    When formulating wheat sowing plans, party committees at all levels in Henan have regarded the prevention and control of wheat diseases and insect pests as an important measure to seize high yields and multiple harvests. The agricultural departments of Henan Province have organized people's communes in various regions to exchange disease-resistant and high-quality wheat varieties on the principle of equivalent exchange. Recently, counties in Nanyang area have supported more than 8 million jin of "Nanda 2419" varieties with strong rust resistance to Kaifeng, Xuchang, Luoyang, Xinxiang and other areas. Xinxiang area supported nearly 7 million jin of "Pingyuan 50" varieties to Kaifeng, Luoyang and other areas and Zhengzhou City. Including the varieties that counties and communes support each other, the area sown with disease-resistant varieties in the province this year will expand by about 1.5 million mu.
    In order to eliminate wheat rust and clear the parasitic weeds of rust, various localities have conducted a general survey of the field edges, road edges, and field headlands near the wheat fields, and designated special personnel to be responsible for removing them at any time. Various localities have also planned to open up "disease-free seed retention bases" during sowing to reserve sufficient high-quality seeds for wheat sowing next year. Scientific research departments at all levels have also fully supported the prevention and control of wheat diseases and insect pests in various localities. The provincial agricultural and commercial departments have allocated more than 4 million jin of pesticides to help people's communes in various localities prevent and control underground wheat pests.

    Hunan
    According to Xinhua News Agency, rural areas in Hunan Province are actively carrying out winter sowing preparations such as seed treatment, fertilizer delivery, and land preparation. Some places have begun to sow winter crops.
    The characteristics of winter sowing in Hunan Province this year are early preparation, early action, large area, and high requirements. This year, the province plans to expand the winter sowing area by about 20 million mu. As early as the beginning of August, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China arranged for autumn and winter production, requiring all localities to prepare for winter sowing as early as possible and expand the winter sowing area as much as possible. All localities have comprehensively planned according to the requirements put forward by the provincial party committee, and made reasonable arrangements for rapeseed, vegetables, green manure and other crops on the premise of ensuring the area of food crops such as wheat, broad beans and peas.
    According to the large increase in winter-sown crops, various localities are rationally arranging labor and preparing seeds and fertilizers as early as possible while grasping the management of autumn fields. At present, more than 1.6 million people in the province are rushing to accumulate fertilizer for winter-sown crops. Various localities are strengthening the cleaning and drying of seeds on the one hand, and adjusting each other according to the principle of equivalent exchange on the other.

    为明年夏季收成超过往年打好基础
    辽宁青海山东湖北四川开展多种种好冬麦群众运动
    河南及早预防病虫害力争小麦苗全苗壮　湖南为冬种准备种子肥料
    辽宁
    据新华社讯　辽宁省各地农村人民公社在秋收的同时，开展了多种冬麦、种好冬麦的群众运动，力争更多的土地变一年一收为一年两收。据最近统计，全省播种的冬麦面积已比去年同期扩大了一倍多。
    扩大冬麦播种面积，是辽宁耕作制度的一项重大革新。过去全省只有很少地区有种冬麦的习惯，1958年大跃进以来，各市、县在部分土地上连续试行了麦稻或麦粮（包括苞米、谷子、高粱、地瓜等）连作，结果既充分利用了地力，又避开了洪水季节，收成比较稳当，一般增产50％左右。根据两年来的经验，各市、县在今年“白露”以前，都纷纷组织力量，采取边秋收、边整地、边送粪、边播种的办法，积极播种冬麦。旅大市各县人民公社播种以前，即在组织上、物质上和技术上作了充分准备，并且将播种冬麦的计划和措施层层落实，播种面积约比去年增加三倍。季节较晚、历年很少种麦的锦州、沈阳、鞍山地区，也在大力抢种冬麦。
    青海
    据新华社讯　青海省农业地区，正在抓紧时机扩大种植冬小麦。西宁市所属各县已经播种的面积，比去年扩大四倍；其他各县的播种面积也比去年有很大增长。
    青海是我国主要的春播作物区之一，各类作物大都集中在春季播种。因此扩大冬小麦的播种面积，对解决春播期中农活繁忙、劳力紧张的矛盾有很大作用。这样，也就能够赢得时间，腾出手来及时完成春播任务。同时冬小麦成熟较早，能提前收获，便于进行复种。为了适时完成种麦任务，各地人民公社在春小麦收割前后，就抽调部分人力、畜力大搞深翻、施肥和选种等工作。最近，各地人民公社随着麦收、打碾基本完成，又增强了秋播力量，争取多种和种好冬小麦。
    山东
    据新华社讯　山东各地抓紧雨后时机，大力抢种小麦。自9月24日以来，山东各地普遍降雨，部分地区雨量较大，有些地区虽雨量较少，但一般也在十毫米以上。为了趁墒播种小麦，中共山东省委在27日发出紧急通知，要求各地抓紧时机播种。各级党委立即行动起来，有的地区停止了一切暂时可以停办的工作，集中90％以上的劳力、畜力、犁、耙、耧、播种机和大小车辆，实行边送粪、边耕、边种。范县各级领导干部都深入田间参加抢种。县委书记处书记郭盛禄，深入到社队具体帮助安排劳力、畜力、工具和抢种的方法；县长庞振江冒雨赶到十八里铺公社，帮助公社召开紧急会议，具体布置抢种措施。
    湖北
    据新华社讯　湖北省各地到9月底已播种小麦、大麦、油菜和豆类作物五百多万亩，播种面积超过了历史上任何一年。一向秋种作物较少的武汉、荆州、黄冈等地区，今年秋种面积也较往年显著扩大，有不少县将扩大一倍左右。
    为了实现多种高产多收，各地都在扩大面积的同时，及早动手深翻整地、积肥送肥、准备种子和播种工具，以保证适时播种，种快种好。襄阳地区在开荒的同时就抓紧了深翻炕土工作，为秋种地准备肥料。随县在收割中稻时，就组织了大量劳力和畜力，边深翻、边平整秋种地。
    各级干部纷纷深入第一线，参加生产领导生产。全省各行各业也都从各方面支援秋耕秋种。
    四川
    据新华社讯　四川各地通过总结历年种植小春早熟作物的经验，决定抓紧“霜降”前后有利时机，发动群众大种小春早熟作物。目前，小春早熟作物的种植计划已落实到队、到田。种植小春早熟作物需要的肥料、种子、工具等物资准备工作，也在积极进行。
    各地在总结了种植小春作物能调剂劳力、畜力、工具，提高土地利用率，有利于在春夏之交青黄不接的时候，安排群众生活，和小春副产物可以增加牲畜青饲料等好处后，纷纷扩大了小春作物计划播种面积。南充、内江、万县、绵阳等专区的许多人民公社，在9月底中稻基本收打完毕后，立即开展了大种小春早熟作物的群众运动。万县经过全民讨论，决定增加十七万亩小春早熟作物，现已开始大量播种。
    河南
    据新华社讯　河南各地采取措施预防小麦病害、诱杀地下虫，力争明年小麦苗全、苗齐、苗壮。
    河南各级党委在制订小麦播种方案时，都把防治小麦病虫害作为夺取高产多收的一项重要措施。河南省农业部门曾经组织各地区人民公社，在等价交换的原则下，互换小麦抗病良种。南阳专区各县最近已支援开封、许昌、洛阳、新乡等专区的抗锈病力强的“南大二四一九”品种八百多万斤。新乡专区支援开封、洛阳等专区和郑州市的“平原五零”品种近七百万斤。加上县与县、社与社互相支援的品种在内，今年全省播种的抗病品种将扩大一百五十万亩左右。
    为了消灭小麦锈病清除锈病的杂草寄生，各地对麦田附近的场边、路边、地头等地方进行了普查，并指定专人负责随时铲除。各地在播种时还有计划地开辟了“无病留种基地”为明年播种小麦留足良种。各级科学研究部门也全力支援各地防治小麦病虫害。省农业部门和商业部门已调拨了四百多万斤农药，帮助各地人民公社防治小麦地下虫害。
    湖南
    据新华社讯　湖南省各地农村积极进行种子处理、送肥、整地等冬播准备，有的地方已开始播种冬季作物。
    今年湖南省冬播的特点是准备早，动手早，面积大，要求高。今年全省计划扩大冬播面积二千万亩左右。早在8月上旬，中共湖南省委就安排了秋冬生产，要求各地及早进行冬播准备，尽量扩大冬播面积。各地都根据省委提出的要求，全面进行规划，在保证小麦、蚕豆、豌豆等粮食作物面积的前提下，对油菜、蔬菜、绿肥等作物也进行了合理安排。
    根据冬播作物大大增加的情况，各地都在大抓秋田管理的同时，合理安排劳力，及早准备种子、肥料。目前全省有一百六十多万人为冬播作物突击积肥。各地一面加强对种子的清理翻晒，一面根据等价交换的原则互相调剂。
