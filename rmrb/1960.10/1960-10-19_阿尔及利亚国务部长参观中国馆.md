Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, October 17th: Algerian Republic Provisional Government Minister of State, Saïd Mohamed, today visited the Chinese Pavilion at the Eighth International Fair being held here.

Mohamed carefully viewed the exhibits on display in the Chinese Pavilion. When he saw the "Red Flag" limousine, a product of China's Great Leap Forward, at the entrance of the Chinese Pavilion, he expressed his hope that the Algerian people would one day be able to manufacture such cars after independence.

Mohamed carefully read the explanations about the development of the Chinese People's Communes. After the visit, he said that everything was excellent. He also expressed his appreciation for the Chinese Pavilion's exhibits in the visitors' book. He wrote, "I am moved by the achievements made by the great people who live in a peaceful environment and seek peace. We hope that all oppressed people will follow the path opened up by the Chinese leaders in order to accelerate their own economic and social independence. Everyone should be inspired by the principles established by China to eradicate the remnants of colonialism and imperialism. Young China has achieved many miracles through its own efforts, selflessness, and spirit of sacrifice. This example is beneficial to all countries seeking peace and social progress. I would like to express my respect and admiration for the hard work, love of peace, and lofty concern for weak nations of the Chinese leaders and the Chinese people. I want to thank them for the unconditional support they have given to the Algerian people in their struggle for freedom and independence."

Minister Mohamed had a cordial conversation with Yu Liguang, head of the Chinese exhibition delegation, and other responsible persons. He once again expressed his gratitude for the support given by the Chinese people to the Algerian people. He said that he was convinced that the friendship and mutual support between the Algerian people and the Chinese people were eternal. He said that the Algerian people were fighting for the unity of all peoples in the world and against imperialism. He pointed out that imperialists produce atomic bombs, and they will suffer the consequences.

Yesterday, Bouzid Al-Aziki, representative of the Algerian Provisional Government's diplomatic mission in Tunis, visited the Chinese Pavilion. After the visit, he told the head of the Chinese exhibition delegation that the imperialists had claimed that China was a backward country and that the Chinese people would not achieve anything. However, the products displayed in the Chinese exhibition hall not only proved that China's economy had made great progress, but also proved that the Chinese people could do anything. This is a great encouragement to the Algerian people, the Tunisian people, and all African people.

    他指出：一切都是出色的；大家都应从中国树立的原则中得到启发来铲除殖民主义和帝国主义的残余；中国领导人、中国人民的辛勤劳动、热爱和平和对弱小民族的崇高的关怀值得钦佩。
    新华社突尼斯17日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府国务部长赛义德·穆罕默德今天参观了在这里举办的第八届国际博览会的中国馆。
    穆罕默德仔细观看了中国馆里展出的展品。当他在中国馆入口处看到了中国大跃进的产物“红旗牌”轿车时，他表示希望，阿尔及利亚人民将来独立以后有一天也能制造这种汽车。
    穆罕默德仔细阅读了关于中国人民公社发展的说明。他在参观以后说，一切都是出色的。他还在观众留言簿上表示他欣赏中国馆的展出，他写道，“我为生活在和平环境里的、谋求和平的伟大人民所获得的成就所感动。我们希望所有被压迫的人民都遵循中国领导人所开辟的道路，以便加速自己的经济和社会独立，大家都应从中国所树立的原则中得到启发来铲除殖民主义和帝国主义的残余。年青的中国凭着自己的努力、忘我精神和牺牲精神实现了许多奇迹。这个榜样对谋求和平和社会进步的各国人民都是有益的。我要对中国领导人、中国人民的辛勤劳动、热爱和平和对弱小民族的崇高的关怀表示我的敬意和钦佩。我要感谢他们对阿尔及利亚人民为争取自由和独立而进行的斗争所给予的无条件的支援。”
    穆罕默德部长同中国展览团团长于黎光等负责人进行了亲切的交谈。他对于中国人民给予阿尔及利亚人民的支持再次表示感谢。他说，他确信，阿尔及利亚人民和中国人民之间的友谊和相互支持是永恒的。他说，阿尔及利亚人民正在为争取全世界各国人民的团结和反对帝国主义而斗争。他指出，帝国主义者生产原子弹，他们将自食其果。
    昨天，阿尔及利亚临时政府驻突尼斯外交代表团代表布齐德·阿勒齐基参观了中国馆。他在参观以后对中国展览团团长说，帝国主义者曾声言中国是个落后的国家，中国人民不会有所成就。但是，在中国展览馆展出的产品不仅证明了中国的经济有了巨大的发展并且也证明了中国人民什么都能做到。对于阿尔及利亚人民、突尼斯人民和全体非洲人民来说，这是巨大的鼓舞。
