    What Does the British Labour Party Annual Conference Show?
    By Our Correspondent Wang Changyun
    How can the British Isles guarantee its peace, independence, and security? Is it to continue to follow the United States' nuclear arms race policy, letting the "Pentagon" decide Britain's fate? Or is it to abandon nuclear weapons, abolish American military bases, and break free from the shackles of the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization? This was the theme of the great debate on defense and foreign policy at the 59th annual conference of the British Labour Party, which closed on the 7th of this month.
    A Blow to the Right-Wing Leadership Group
    The Labour Party's right-wing leaders and their followers repeated the old tune of imperialist "position of strength," saying that only by relying on the United States' "atomic deterrence" can there be "peace" and "independence." They also threatened that if Britain abandoned nuclear weapons, it would lose the trust of the United States, thereby losing "international influence" and making it impossible for the Labour Party to come to power for several years.
    Most of the representatives in their speeches denounced these hypocritical arguments. They cited facts to show that following the United States' arms race policy and relying on American nuclear weapons and missile bases posed a great threat to Britain's security. One representative questioned the right-wing leaders, saying, if the American "Pentagon" can order the U.S. Air Force to conduct espionage flights from British bases without notifying the British Prime Minister, where is Britain's independence and security?
    Regardless of the right-wing leaders' political threats and behind-the-scenes lobbying, the Labour Party annual conference finally passed two proposals put forward by the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Transport and General Workers' Union, advocating that Britain unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons and abolish missile bases in Britain. The conference also rejected the right-wing leaders' "defense policy" based on reliance on American nuclear weapons and loyalty to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This clearly shows the strong desire of the British people and Labour Party grassroots members to strive for peace and oppose the United States' nuclear arms race policy, and it is a blow to the right-wing leadership.
    The Struggle Against Nuclear Arms Race Policy is Developing
    In the past year, the British public's movement against nuclear arms race policies and American bases has developed extensively. In April of this year, approximately 10,000 people participated in a march from the Aldermaston Atomic Weapons Research Establishment to London. British youth also held a "coast-to-coast" march against nuclear weapons and American military bases. After the United States sabotaged the Four-Power Summit, rallies and demonstrations were held in various parts of Britain, especially in areas where American air bases are located, protesting against the intrusion of American spy planes into Soviet airspace. Recently, a team with wide participation from various strata of society held a march from Edinburgh to London against hydrogen bombs and American bases.
    This sentiment of the British people has also had a profound development within the trade union movement, which has always been controlled by the right wing. The British Trades Union Congress, held in early September, passed a proposal from the Transport and General Workers' Union, demanding the abandonment of all policies based on atomic threats. The two largest trade unions in Britain, the Transport and General Workers' Union and the Amalgamated Engineering Union, with a total of more than two million members, decided to support Britain's unilateral abandonment of nuclear weapons and the abolition of nuclear bases, which determined the fate of the right-wing "defense" policy at this Labour Party annual conference.
    The Crisis of Social Reformism is Deepening
    This Labour Party annual conference also fully reflected the increasingly deepening crisis of the Labour Party and the entire Western social reformism.
    Recently, over the past year, the British economy has deteriorated, unemployment has become serious, urban rents have soared, and coal prices are about to rise again as winter approaches. These facts shattered the absurd theory of the Labour Party's right-wing leaders about "new prosperous capitalism."
    After last year's general election, Gaitskell and other right-wing leaders attempted to attribute the Labour Party's failure to an overemphasis on "nationalization," advocating the deletion of clauses related to "public ownership" from the Labour Party program. They even wanted to throw away the deceptive "nationalization" signboard that they had never seriously implemented. This proposal aroused strong indignation and protests from Labour Party grassroots members.
    All of this could not but make the Labour Party grassroots members' dissatisfaction with the right-wing leadership increasingly acute, and the Labour Party's crisis deepened further. According to the statistics in the Labour Party annual conference report, in 1959, when the Labour Party leadership absorbed a large number of members to participate in the election, the Labour Party's membership decreased by 105,000, and the number of people who left the party was the highest since 1941.
    Gunter, a member of the Labour Party National Executive Committee, admitted in his speech at this Labour Party annual conference that many people felt "a very worrying sentiment, that the world's largest social democratic party is in, if not a state of disintegration, at least in decline." He said that "a sentiment of disappointment and failure" was prevalent within the Labour Party.
    The Struggle Will Continue
    This struggle surrounding the Labour Party's policies is only a beginning. Although the right-wing leadership group suffered a defeat at the annual conference, they will never change their policies. Gaitskell and other right-wing leaders declared that the Labour Party parliamentary group was elected by the voters, and their activities inside and outside the parliament can only be accountable to the voters, and not subject to the constraints of the majority resolutions of the annual conference. Under the manipulation of the right-wing leadership, although the Labour Party annual conference passed a resolution reaffirming that the annual conference is the party's highest decision-making body, a condition was forcibly imposed on the resolution: "The annual conference has no right to control and order the parliamentary group."
    Gaitskell also openly threatened that he would "continue to fight" inside and outside the parliament in order to "change" the annual conference's resolution on Britain's unilateral abandonment of nuclear weapons and the abolition of rocket bases in the next twelve months. It is reported that he is preparing to carry out activities to divide the trade unions and revise the party constitution in order to regain the upper hand at next year's Trades Union Congress and the next Labour Party annual conference.
    The results of the Labour Party annual conference caused anxiety and unease in the British ruling group. Comments in the bourgeois newspapers had to admit that the movement against nuclear weapons has a deep mass base in Britain, and they worried that this new trend in the Labour Party, as the main opposition party in parliament, would damage US-British relations. The "Manchester Guardian" advised the United States not to regard this trend as "an accidental mistake," and the newspaper said: "The sentiment against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is real." On the other hand, they tried their best to downplay the significance and impact of the conference. The "Daily Telegraph," which has close ties with the Conservative Party, hurriedly published an editorial after the annual conference passed a resolution on Britain's unilateral abandonment of nuclear weapons to express its attitude to the United States and beg for trust. It said that the Labour Party annual conference's resolution would never affect the British government's fulfillment of its responsibilities in its alliance with the United States.

### 英国工党年会说明了什么？

    英国工党年会说明了什么？
    本报记者　王昌运
    英伦三岛怎样才能保障它的和平、独立和安全？是继续追随美国核备战政策，让“五角大楼”来决定英国的命运呢？还是放弃核武装，取消美国军事基地，摆脱美国和北大西洋集团的绞索呢？这是本月7日闭幕的英国工党第五十九届年会上国防外交政策大辩论的主题。
    对右翼领导集团的一个打击
    工党右翼领导及其追随者，重弹帝国主义“实力地位”的老调，说什么只有依靠美国的“原子威慑”才有“和平”和“独立”。他们还威胁说，英国放弃核武装就会失去美国的信任，从而丧失“国际影响”，并使工党在若干年中无法上台执政。
    大多数代表在发言中痛斥这些虚伪的论据。他们列举事实说明，追随美国备战政策，依靠美国核武装和导弹基地，给英国的安全带来了极大的威胁。一位代表质问右翼领导说，美国“五角大楼”可以不通知英国首相就下令美国空军从英国基地进行间谍飞行，英国的独立和安全在哪里呢？
    不顾右翼领导的政治威胁和幕后拉拢，工党年会终于通过了混合机械工业工会和运输与普通工人工会提出的两个提案，主张英国单方面放弃核子武器和取消在英国的导弹基地。年会还否决了右翼领导以依赖美国核武器和忠于北大西洋公约为基础的“国防政策”。这明确地显示了英国人民和工党基层党员争取和平、反对美国核备战政策的强烈愿望，并且是对右翼领导的一个打击。
    反对核备战政策的斗争在发展着
    在过去的一年中，英国公众反对核备战政策和美国基地的运动有了广泛的发展。今年4月，大约有一万人参加了从阿尔德马斯顿原子武器研究中心徒步到伦敦的游行示威。英国青年还曾举行了一次“从海岸到海岸”的反对核武器、反对美国军事基地的游行。美国破坏了四国首脑会议之后，英国各地，特别是美国空军基地所在地，纷纷举行游行示威，抗议美国间谍飞机侵入苏联领空。最近，一支有广泛阶层参加的队伍，又举行了从爱丁堡到伦敦的反氢弹、反美国基地的徒步示威游行。
    英国人民的这种情绪，在一向为右翼控制的工会运动内也有了深入的发展。9月初举行的英国职工大会，通过了运输与普通工人工会的提案，要求放弃一切以原子威胁为基础的政策。共拥有二百多万会员的英国两个最大工会，运输与普通工人工会和混合机械工业工会，分别决定支持英国单方面放弃核武装和取消核基地的政策，这就决定了右翼“国防”政策在这次工党年会上的命运。
    社会改良主义的危机日益深刻化
    这届工党年会也充分反映了工党和整个西方社会改良主义的危机的日益深刻化。
    最近，一年来，英国经济状况日益恶化，失业现象严重，城市房租飞涨，而最近冬季将临之际煤价又要上涨。这些事实，粉碎了工党右翼领导所谓“新的繁荣的资本主义”的荒谬理论。
    盖茨克尔及其他右翼领袖在去年大选以后，企图把工党的失败归咎于过多地强调了“国有化”，主张从工党党纲中删去有关“公有制”的条款。他们连从来没有认真执行过的骗人的“国有化”招牌都要抛掉了。这一主张引起了工党基层党员的强烈愤慨和抗议。
    所有这些都不能不使工党基层党员对右翼领导的不满越来越尖锐，工党的危机越来越加深。根据工党年会报告的统计，在工党领导为了参加竞选而大量吸收党员的1959年，工党党员却减少了十万五千人，退党人数之多是1941年以来的最高纪录。
    工党全国执行委员会委员根特在这次工党年会发言时承认，许多人都感觉到“一种令人十分忧虑的情绪，即世界上最大的社会民主党正处在，假如还不是分崩离析的状况中，至少是在衰退中”。他说，在工党内部正流行着“一种失望和失败的情绪”。
    斗争还将继续下去
    围绕着工党政策的这场斗争，还只是一个开始。右翼领导集团虽然在年会上遭到了失败，但是他们决不会改变政策。盖茨克尔及其他右翼领袖宣称，工党议会党团是选民选举产生的，他们在议会内外的活动只能对选民负责，而不接受年会多数决议的约束。在右翼领导操纵之下，工党年会虽然通过了一个重申年会为党的最高决策机构的决议，但是，决议上被强加了一个条件：“年会无权控制和命令议会党团”。
    盖茨克尔也公然威胁说，他要在议会内外“继续战斗”下去，以便在今后的十二个月中“改变”年会关于英国单方面放弃核武装和撤消火箭基地的决议。据报道，他正准备进行分化工会和修改党章的活动，以便在明年的职工大会和下届工党年会上重占上风。
    工党年会的结果在英国统治集团中引起了焦虑和不安。资产阶级报纸的评论不得不承认反对核武装的运动在英国有着深厚的群众基础，他们担心作为议会的主要反对党——工党出现了这一新的动向会对美英关系带来损害。“曼彻斯特卫报”就劝美国不要把这种趋势只看作“偶然的过失”，这家报纸说：“反对北大西洋公约的情绪是真实的”。另一方面，他们又尽力贬低会议的意义和影响。同保守党有密切关系的“每日电讯报”在年会通过英国单方面放弃核武装的决议后，赶忙发表社论向美国表明态度，乞求信任。它说，工党年会的决议决不会影响英国政府执行它同美国联盟中应尽的职责。
