		Determined to Rebuild Their Homes
		--Gaoyingqiang Brigade of Zhangtaizi Commune in Liaoyang Rapidly Resumes Production
		By Our Reporter Gao Fang, Liaoyang Daily Reporter Wang Guang
	In early September, we arrived at the Gaoyingqiang Brigade of Zhangtaizi Commune in Liaoyang City, on the east bank of the Taizi River, which had been flooded. The post-disaster production and construction here are in full swing, filled with inspiring scenes of determined efforts.

	At dawn, the clear bell sound awakens the villagers from their sound sleep, and they enthusiastically begin a day's work.
	In the fields, connected patches of thousands of mu of vegetable fields are green as lawns. The early-planted cabbages and radishes are already three or four inches high. In the hemp fields, the freshly cut green hemp, tied into bundles of ten or twenty, are arranged in rows like long snakes stretching into the distance. Several large carts travel back and forth on the village roads, constantly transporting the full loads of hemp bundles to the pools for retting. In the northeast corner of the village is an endless expanse of green rice paddies, where two tireless water pumps draw water from the river into the canals from morning till night, irrigating more than 400 mu of rice fields…
	In the evening, the courtyard of the brigade headquarters is filled with people, and the meeting of cadres above the level of small team leader begins. Yao Hongzhang, the Party branch secretary of the brigade, conveys the Party Central Committee’s call for the entire Party and all the people to take action, vigorously develop agriculture, and vigorously develop grain production, as well as the commune Party committee’s plan for doing a good job in the "three autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing). Then, the persons in charge of sanitation and construction report on the work situation. This is followed by a lively discussion and a resolution is made for future actions…
	It seems that production and life here are proceeding in an orderly and vibrant manner. Who would have known that an extraordinarily severe flood, unseen in a century, had occurred here not long ago? A month ago, the rushing and roaring waters of the Taizi River swallowed everything in the village. The crops were submerged in water more than ten feet deep, leaving only black rooftops and clumps of treetops exposed on the water’s surface. Thanks to the heroic rescue efforts of the cadres and commune members, most of the grain, vegetable seeds, livestock, and vehicles were rescued. More than a thousand commune members were squatting on rooftops and trees… At this time, the Party sent the People's Liberation Army to rescue them by boat, ensuring the safe evacuation of all commune members. However, 80% of the crops were destroyed, more than half of the houses were washed away or collapsed, agricultural tools and firewood were all swept away, and most of the commune members' clothing was lost.
	But, in less than a month, the heroic people have stood up from the ruins washed away by the flood, and the work of production relief and reconstruction has achieved great success.

	Indeed, the difficulties faced by the Gaoyingqiang Brigade after the disaster are serious. But they resolutely listen to the Party and overcome and are overcoming these difficulties one by one with a strong will that man can conquer nature.
	On August 8, the fourth day after the flood receded, the commune members who had been evacuated to other villages returned one after another. It was a great joy that people were able to return safely; but upon returning to the village, everyone felt heavy-hearted seeing the village and its surroundings in a chaotic state from the flood, the crops destroyed, and the houses collapsed. “How can a tiger start eating heaven?” People looked at the brigade Party branch secretary and the cadres stationed in the team.
	The cadres of the brigade Party branch and the municipal Party committee work group had been staying in the village during the flood. The second day after the flood began to recede, they held the first branch meeting after the disaster on the rooftops, which were still surrounded by a vast expanse of water. They analyzed the current situation and the ideological state of the commune members, and established confidence in overcoming difficulties and rebuilding their homes. The minds of the cadres were armed. The meeting also decided to immediately divide production, life, and salvage and construction into three fronts, and to take immediate action.
	The next day, the cadres of the municipal Party committee work group, brigade cadres, and Party members took the lead in going to the fields and sowing autumn vegetable seeds on the land where they could barely stand. Without agricultural tools, they used sticks to poke a hole, scattered the seeds, and planted 17.55 mu of cabbage in one day. On the third day, the seedlings emerged neatly, greatly boosting the morale of the rush planting. The canteen's house was washed down by the flood. The administrators and cooks repaired the collapsed house, pulled the pots and pans out of the silt, and ensured that the canteen opened on time.
	Then, the condolence groups from Anshan City and the People's Liberation Army arrived, and medical teams also arrived. The brigade Party branch, in conjunction with the condolence activities, conducted in-depth ideological education on production relief among the masses. At a symposium, poor peasant commune member Hu Shifan said: “There was also a big flood in 1929. On the day of the flood, the landlords gathered to make trouble, and grain immediately became expensive. Many families were begging in the streets; this year's flood is much bigger than that year. If it weren't for the Party sending life-saving boats, who knows how many people would have drowned!” If the lamp isn't adjusted, it won't shine; if the words aren't spoken, things won't be clear. This symposium untied the knots in the minds of the commune members, boosted their energy, and the attendance rate of the entire brigade reached more than 90%.

		“F O U R   L O S S E S   A N D   F O U R   F I N D S”
	In order to make up for the losses, the brigade branch put forward the battle cry of "find dry land in water fields, find vegetables in grain losses, find side occupations in agricultural losses, find next year for this year's losses." Through the methods of checking, looking, calculating, and comparing, they mobilized the masses to formulate plans and launched a high tide of production relief.
	An inspection team composed of cadres and experienced peasants was established. The entire team found that there were more than 450 mu of rice, more than 150 mu of corn, and more than 360 mu of green hemp that still had harvests. The brigade also decided to plant 1,500 mu of autumn vegetables and vigorously develop side occupations after the autumn. With this detailed calculation, although this year's income is not as good as a year of bumper harvest, it is not much different from an ordinary year. People knew what they had, felt they had a future, and became more energetic.
	Old man Lang Youlin saw that the team had about 2,000 jin of peas, which were getting a little hot in the barn, so he quietly and voluntarily winnowed them once, making them clean. During the rush planting of autumn vegetables, he always came early and left late, worked ahead of others, and constantly encouraged everyone, saying: "Let's work happily, plant one day earlier and it will grow one day earlier, and harvest more!" Now the entire brigade has sown more than 1,200 mu of autumn vegetables, and rushed to harvest more than 360 mu of green hemp and part of the corn.
	In this disaster relief struggle, people were deeply encouraged by the warmth of the commune family! As soon as the flood receded, the Party branch of the non-disaster area Jianshanzi Brigade sent a warm letter of condolence to the Party branch of Gaoyingqiang Brigade. The letter said: You have encountered serious difficulties, and your difficulties are our difficulties; in order to support you, we will provide people if you need people, materials if you need materials, and money if you need money! And they sent four carpenters to help repair houses, and lent 70 sickles, 5,000 jin of fodder, 300 pieces of clothing, and 20 pairs of shoes. The captain of Changshan Brigade personally sent some fresh vegetables to express condolences.
	The commune Party committee transferred two water pumps and sent technicians to help pump river water to irrigate the rice fields, and transferred more than 1,000 jin of vegetable seeds. The grain for the brigade's food and the bricks, tiles, and wood for repairing houses were also resolved as much as possible. With the active support of technicians sent by the state-owned construction company and fraternal communes, most of the houses that were destroyed have been repaired.

    发愤图强重建家园
    ——重灾区辽阳张台子公社高营墙大队迅速恢复生产
    本报记者　高方　辽阳日报记者　王光
    9月初秋，我们来到太子河东岸曾经被洪水淹没的辽阳市张台子公社高营墙大队，这里灾后的生产建设搞得热火朝天，到处充满着一片发愤图强的动人景象。
          站　立　起　来
    黎明，嘹亮的钟声把全村的人从酣睡中唤醒，人们兴致勃勃地开始了一天的劳动。
    田野上，片片相连的千亩菜田，绿色如茵，早种的白菜、萝卜已有三、四寸高；在麻地里，刚割完的青麻，一、二十捆架在一起，摆成一列列的长蛇阵伸向远方，几台大车在村道上来往不停地把满载的麻捆运到泡子里去沤制；村子的东北角，是一眼望不到边的绿油油的稻田，两台不知疲倦的抽水机，从早到晚把河水抽到渠道里，为四百多亩稻田灌溉浆水……。
    傍晚，在大队队部的院子里坐满了人，小队长以上的干部会议开始了。大队党支部书记姚鸿章，传达了党中央关于全党全民动手，大办农业、大办粮食的号召和公社党委关于做好“三秋”工作的部署。接着，卫生和修建工作的负责人，分别报告了工作情况。随后是热烈的讨论，作出今后行动的决议……。
    看起来，这里的生产和生活进行得井然有序，生气勃勃。谁能知道这里不久以前曾经发生过百年不遇的特大水灾？一个月前，奔腾咆哮的太子河水吞没了全村的一切，庄稼都被淹没在一丈多深的水里，只留有黑色的房顶和一丛丛的树梢露在水面上。由于干部和社员的英勇抢救，大部分粮食、菜籽、牲畜和车辆算是抢救出来了，一千多名社员蹲在房顶和树上……，这时党派来解放军驾船抢救，使全体社员安全脱险。但80％的庄稼被冲毁了，半数以上的房屋被冲走或倒塌，农具、柴草一荡而尽，社员的衣物损失了大半。
    但是，不到一个月的时间，英雄的人民在被洪水洗劫的废墟上站立起来了，生产救灾和重建家园的工作获得了巨大的成就。
          坚　定　信　心
    的确，高营墙大队灾后面临的困难是严重的。但是他们坚决听党的话，以人定胜天的坚强意志，一个一个地战胜了和正在战胜着这些困难。
    8月8日，洪水消退的第四天，转移到外村的社员陆续回来了。人能够安全的回来，是件大喜事；但是回村一看，村里村外被洪水冲得乱七八糟，庄稼毁了，房屋塌了，每个人的心情都很沉重。“老虎吃天从何下口”？人们两眼瞧着大队党支部书记和驻队的干部。
    大队党支部和市委工作组的干部，在洪水期间一直坚持留在村里。洪水开始消退的第二天，他们便在四周还是一片汪洋的房盖上召开了灾后第一次支部会议：分析了当前形势和社员的思想情况，确立了战胜困难、重建家园的信心。干部的思想武装起来了。会上还决定从大队到小队立即划分生产、生活和打捞修建三条战线，并立即行动起来。
    第二天，市委工作组、大队干部、党员便带头下地，在刚能站住脚的土地上播下了秋菜种。没有农具，他们用棍子捅一个坑，撒上种，一天就种了十七亩五分五厘白菜，第三天苗出得齐刷刷的，大大鼓舞了抢种的士气。食堂的房子被水冲倒了，管理员和炊事员们把倒塌的房子修起来，从淤泥里把锅碗瓢盆扒出来，保证了食堂按时开伙。
    接着，鞍山市和解放军的慰问团来了，医疗队也来了。大队党支部结合慰问活动，在群众中深入地开展了生产救灾的思想教育。在一次座谈会上，贫农社员胡士范说：“1929年也涨过一场大水，来水的当天，地主就集合起来捣鬼，粮食马上贵起来了，不少人家沿街乞讨；今年的水比那年大多了，如果不是党派来救命船，不知要淹死多少人！”灯不拨不亮，话不说不明，这次座谈会把社员思想上的疙瘩解开了，干劲鼓起来了，全大队劳动出勤率达到90％以上。
        “四　丢　四　找”
    为了弥补损失，大队支部提出了“旱田丢了水田找，粮食丢了蔬菜找，农业丢了副业找，今年丢了明年找”的战斗口号，通过查、看、算、比的方法，发动群众制订了规划，开展了生产救灾高潮。
    一个由干部、老农组成的检查组成立了。全队查出有四百五十多亩水稻、一百五十多亩玉米、三百六十多亩青麻，还有收成；大队又确定种一千五百亩秋菜，秋后大力开展副业生产。这样一算细账，虽然今年的收入比不上丰收的年景，但和平常年景也不相上下。人们心中有数了，也觉得有奔头了，干劲更足了。
    郎有林老大爷看见队里有两千来斤豌豆，在囤子里有些发热了，就不声不响地主动地把它扬了一遍，整得干干净净。在抢种秋菜当中，他总是早来晚走，干在前头，并且不断地鼓动大家说：“咱们欢干呀，早种一天就早长一天，多收一些！”现在全大队已播种秋菜一千二百多亩，抢收青麻三百六十多亩以及部分玉米。
    在这次抗灾斗争中，人们深为公社大家庭的温暖所鼓舞！洪水刚退去，非灾区的尖山子大队党支部，就给高营墙大队支部寄来了热情的慰问信。信里说：你们遇到了严重的困难，你们的困难就是我们的困难；为了支援你们，要人有人，要物有物，要钱有钱！并且派来了四名木工帮助修房子，借给七十把镰刀、五千斤饲草、三百件衣服、二十双鞋子。长山大队队长亲自送来一些鲜菜表示慰问。
    公社党委调来两台水泵和派来技术工人，帮助抽河水灌溉稻田，调给了一千多斤菜籽，大队吃粮和修盖房屋用的砖瓦、木料，也都尽可能帮助解决了。在国营建筑工程公司和兄弟公社派来的技术工人的积极支援下，被冲坏的房屋绝大部分已经修复。
