Xinhua News Agency, 11th, New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the evening of the 10th to continue discussing the agenda of the current session. After the United States manipulated the General Assembly on the 8th to decide not to discuss the issue of Chinese representation, it again manipulated the voting machine last night to include the so-called "Tibet Question" and "Hungarian Question," which interfere in the internal affairs of China and Hungary and poison the international atmosphere, on the agenda of the General Assembly once again.

The so-called "Tibet Question," which interferes in China's internal affairs, was put forward by Malaya and Thailand at the instigation of the United States and Britain. At the General Assembly last night, representatives from the Soviet Union, Romania, Indonesia, and other countries resolutely opposed including this provocative issue on the agenda.

Soviet representative Zorin said that the Soviet delegation firmly opposed the General Committee's recommendation to include the so-called "Tibet Question" on the agenda of the 15th session of the General Assembly because the Tibet issue is China's internal affair. He continued that, as in the past, the planners who put the "Tibet Question" on the agenda of the General Assembly wanted to divert the United Nations' attention from resolving international issues of great significance to the people of all countries. They also want to use this to slander the People's Republic of China and use the United Nations to undermine world peace and international security.

Zorin said that representatives from the United States and certain other countries want to push the United Nations onto the path of interfering in China's internal affairs while, at the same time, obstructing the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. This shows that the purpose pursued by provocatively raising the so-called "Tibet Question" is not to ease the international situation and improve relations between countries, but something else entirely. On behalf of the Soviet delegation, Zorin called on representatives of all countries to reject the General Committee's recommendation to include the "Tibet Question" on the agenda of the General Assembly.

Indonesian representative Subandrio said: "Tibet... is part of China, a fact that was universally recognized long before the establishment of the People's Republic of China." He pointed out that the United Nations has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign countries. Subandrio also expressed regret over the situation in which the government of the People's Republic of China was illegally deprived of its right to send representatives to the United Nations to express its position on this issue.

Representatives from New Zealand, Ireland, and El Salvador, following the tune of their American masters, unscrupulously slandered the People's Republic of China and supported the General Assembly's discussion of "issues" that interfere in our country's internal affairs.

Under the manipulation of the United States, the General Assembly passed the inclusion of the so-called "Tibet Question" on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly by a vote of forty-nine to thirteen, with thirty-five abstentions. The Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, Guinea, Indonesia, Mali, and Yugoslavia voted against it. Most Asian and African delegations abstained. The votes in favor were mainly from the United States, Britain, and their military allies, etc.

When speaking at the meeting, US representative Morse unscrupulously slandered the Soviet Union and the Hungarian People's Republic when requesting that the so-called "Hungarian Question" be included on the agenda of the General Assembly. He nonsensically claimed that not discussing this issue would "damage the United Nations' prestige and moral strength," and even openly clamored that the day will come when Hungary "under the rule of" the Soviet Union "gains freedom."

Hungarian representative Kadar spoke to refute this shameless fallacy. He pointed out that this so-called "Hungarian Question" was imposed on the United Nations by the United States. He said that raising this issue is illegal, violates the United Nations Charter, and is a result of the Cold War. He emphasized that the purpose of raising this issue is to divert the attention of representatives of all countries from discussing major international issues.

Twelve delegations voted against including the notorious so-called "Hungarian Question" on the agenda, thirty-one delegations abstained, and fifty-four delegations voted in favor under the pressure of the United States.

The General Assembly also passed the inclusion of disarmament issues, the Algerian issue, the Congo issue, the South African Union's racial discrimination issue, the issue of threats to universal peace caused by the United States' aggressive actions against the Soviet Union, and other issues on the agenda of the General Assembly.

The discussion of the General Assembly's agenda has thus ended. The General Assembly's afternoon session on the 11th will discuss the allocation of various agenda items to the various working committees of the United Nations General Assembly.

    美国操纵联大把“西藏问题”和“匈牙利问题”列入议程
    苏匈代表谴责美国粗暴干涉中匈内政
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会10日晚间举行全体会议继续讨论本届会议议程。美国继8日操纵大会决定不讨论中国代表权问题后，昨晚又操纵表决机器把干涉中国和匈牙利内政、毒化国际气氛的所谓“西藏问题”和“匈牙利问题”又一次列入大会议程。
    这个干涉中国内政的所谓“西藏问题”是美、英两国唆使马来亚和泰国出面提出的。在昨晚大会上，苏联、罗马尼亚和印度尼西亚等国代表坚决反对把这个挑衅性的问题列入议程。
    苏联代表佐林说，苏联代表团坚决反对总务委员会关于把所谓“西藏问题”列入联大第十五届会议议程的建议，因为西藏问题是中国的内政。他接着说，和过去一样，把“西藏问题”列入联大议程的策划者是想转移联合国对解决当前对世界各国人民具有重大意义的国际问题的注意力。他们还想以此诽谤中华人民共和国，并利用联合国破坏世界和平和国际安全。
    佐林说，美国和其他某些国家代表要把联合国推上干涉中国内政的道路，与此同时，却阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。这表明，挑衅性地提出所谓“西藏问题”所追求的目的不是要缓和国际局势和改善各国之间的关系，而完全是另一种目的。佐林以苏联代表团的名义呼吁各国代表否决总务委员会关于把“西藏问题”列入联大议程的建议。
    印度尼西亚代表苏班德里约说：“西藏……是中国的一部分，这是在中华人民共和国建立以前早已众所公认的事实。”他指出联合国无权干涉主权国家的内政。苏班德里约还对中华人民共和国政府被非法剥夺了派遣代表在联合国表明它对这个问题的立场的权利的这种状况表示遗憾。
    新西兰、爱尔兰、萨尔瓦多的代表遵照它们美国主子的腔调，对中华人民共和国大肆诬蔑，赞成大会讨论干涉我国内政的“问题”。
    在美国操纵下，大会以四十九票对十三票，三十五票弃权通过把所谓“西藏问题”列入联合国大会议程。苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚、乌克兰、几内亚、印度尼西亚、马里、南斯拉夫投票反对。大部分亚洲、非洲国家代表团弃权。投票赞成的主要是美国、英国和它们的军事盟国等。
    美国代表莫尔斯在会上发言要求把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入大会议程时大肆诬蔑苏联和匈牙利人民共和国。他胡说什么不讨论这个问题会“损害联合国的威信和道义力量”，甚至公然叫嚷什么在苏联“统治下的”匈牙利“获得自由的日子终将到来”。
    匈牙利代表卡达尔发言驳斥这种无耻的谬论。他指出这个所谓“匈牙利问题”是美国强加给联合国的。他说，提出这个问题是非法的，是违背联合国宪章的，是冷战的结果。他着重指出，提出这个问题的目的在于转移各国代表对讨论重大国际问题的注意力。
    投票反对把恶名昭彰的所谓“匈牙利问题”列入议程的有十二个代表团，弃权的有三十一个代表团，在美国压力下投票赞成的有五十四个代表团。
    大会还通过把裁军问题、阿尔及利亚问题、刚果问题、南非联邦种族歧视问题、由于美国对苏联的侵略行动所造成的对普遍和平的威胁的问题等列入大会议程。
    大会议程的讨论就此结束。大会11日下午会议将讨论把各项议程分配给联合国大会各个工作委员会。
