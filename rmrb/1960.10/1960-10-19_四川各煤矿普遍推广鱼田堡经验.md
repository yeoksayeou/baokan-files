Sichuan Coal Mines Universally Promote the Yutianbao Experience
Political and ideological work goes down the mines, into the workshops, and into the kitchens, grasping deeply, tightly, and steadily, which has become an important characteristic of the leadership style of many coal mines, and the province's coal production has maintained a continuous high-yield situation.

(Our newspaper Chengdu, October 18th) Sichuan Province's coal mines, in the process of learning and promoting the Yutianbao underground office experience, have further improved the work style and leadership methods of cadres, making "four togethers" regular and systematic. Currently, the seventeen large mines along the province's transportation lines and the vast number of small coal kilns in various counties have universally established an underground office system. Many mines have achieved political and ideological work going down the mines, into the workshops, and into the kitchens, grasping deeply, tightly, and steadily, which has become an important characteristic of the leadership style of many coal mines. Due to the changes in the work style and leadership methods of the vast number of coal mine cadres, conditions have been created for the sustained high production of coal mines. Since the third quarter, the province's coal production has maintained a continuous high-yield situation.

Since July this year, when Sichuan Province further emphasized "four togethers," the work style and work methods of leading cadres at all levels have generally greatly improved. In July, the Yutianbao Coal Mine in Chongqing City first summarized a set of underground office experience. Their approach makes the leadership work specific and detailed, and solves problems more timely and accurately; the work style of cadres eating, living, laboring, and discussing with workers has also become a system within the coal mine. After the Yutianbao experience was disseminated among the province's coal mines, various coal mines quickly promoted this experience in light of local conditions. The Zhongliangshan Coal Mine, according to the characteristics of multi-seam and multi-level mining, established command posts at different levels below the underground command headquarters to deal with problems within the scope of this level in a timely manner, and organized the various departments on the ground to establish a joint office at the wellhead, so that the underground and the ground could be closely linked to solve problems that could not be solved underground. In implementing the underground office system, the Zengjiashan Coal Mine formed a on-site key problem tackling working group composed of leading cadres, including the mine manager, technicians, well captains, and party branch secretaries, to effectively solve key problems, and through grasping key problems, helped cadres master the laws of coal production and improve the management level of cadres. After adopting this method, they solved more than 100 specific problems affecting production within 20 days, which promoted a substantial increase in the mine's production.

In the process of implementing the underground office system, in order to form a strong production front-line command center, coal mines in various places have generally ensured that cadres take turns in shifts and follow through to the end. Each shift has a "commander-in-chief," and the strength of the night shift has been particularly strengthened. This facilitates strengthening on-site political and ideological work and production organization work, timely solving problems, and seizing high yields in every shift. The No. 1 Well of Tianfu Coal Mine unified and organized the cadres of the entire well's Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League and the leading cadres of various departments such as tunneling, coal mining, machinery and electricity, ventilation, transportation, and supply, into three shifts to work with the team, lead production. Each shift has two to three well-level main responsible cadres responsible for the production command work of the entire shift, and each shift has a complete set of functional personnel. Therefore, the command and dispatch of the production site has been greatly strengthened, and problems are discovered and solved more timely than in the past. The raw coal output of the entire mine from October 1st to 5th increased by 21.5% compared with the last five days of September.

In learning from the Yutianbao experience, many coal mines have further summarized the "four togethers" approach of cadres and the masses as "five combinations," namely, combining participation in labor with solving problems and helping improve the ability of grassroots cadres; combining labor with carrying out on-site political and ideological work; combining labor with caring about the lives of the masses; combining labor with contracting to complete tasks; and combining staying at a point with turning the surface. The Party General Branch of Rongchang Coal Mine of Yongrong Mining Bureau divided the cadres on the front line into three coal mining teams, three tunneling working faces, and three transportation teams to contract for output, ideological work, life, cyclical operation, and deep-hole operation. The responsible cadres of the well also adopted the method of spending most of their time at a point and a small amount of time running the surface, so that the points and the surface could be better combined. After doing this, the entire mine saw a "three fast" situation of problems being discovered quickly, key problems being solved quickly, and experience being promoted quickly, and a "three high" phenomenon of high output, high work efficiency, and high enthusiasm of workers in production.

When learning and promoting the Yutianbao experience, coal mines in various places have paid special attention to learning from Yutianbao's experience in helping workers formulate team covenants. Coal mines in several special districts, such as Jiangjin, Mianyang, Wenjiang, and Fuling, universally formulated team covenants in a few days. After the coal mines in Yongchuan County implemented the team covenant, the average daily production level of raw coal increased by 18.32%. After learning from the Yutianbao experience and formulating team covenants, the Zengjiashan Coal Mine achieved preparations before the shift, production during the shift, and handover at the end of the shift, and production increased by 10%.

    四川各煤矿普遍推广鱼田堡经验
    政治思想工作下矿井、下工房、下厨房，抓得深、抓得紧、抓得稳，已成为许多煤矿领导作风的重要特征，全省煤炭产量一直保持持续高产的局面
    本报成都18日电　四川省各地煤矿在学习推广鱼田堡井下办公经验的过程中，进一步改进干部的工作作风和领导方法，使“四同”经常化、制度化。目前，全省交通沿线十七个大矿和各县的广大小煤窑群，都普遍建立了井下办公制度，许多矿井都作到了政治思想工作下矿井、下工房、下厨房。抓得深、抓得紧、抓得稳，已经成为当前许多煤矿领导作风的重要特征。由于广大煤矿干部领导作风、领导方法的改变，为煤矿的持续高产创造了条件。从第三季度以来，全省的煤炭产量一直保持了持续高产的局面。
    四川省各地煤矿从今年7月进一步强调“四同”以来，各级领导干部的工作作风和工作方法普遍有了很大的改进。7月份，重庆市鱼田堡煤矿首先总结出一套井下办公的经验。他们的作法使得领导工作做得具体、细致，解决问题更加及时、准确；干部与工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量的作风也因此在煤矿内成为制度。鱼田堡的经验在全省煤矿中传播以后，各地煤矿都因地制宜地迅速推广了这一经验。中梁山煤矿根据矿井多煤层、多水平开采的特点，在井下指挥部下面又分不同水平设立了指挥站，及时处理本水平范围内的问题，并把地面各科室组织起来，成立了井口联合办公室，使井下地面取得密切联系，及时解决井下不能解决的问题。曾家山煤矿在实行井下办公制度中，领导干部包括矿长、技术人员、井长、党总支书记等组成现场攻关工作组，切切实实解决关键问题，并且通过抓关键，帮助干部掌握煤炭生产规律，提高干部管理水平。他们采取这种方法后，在二十天内就解决了一百多个影响生产的具体问题，促进了全矿生产大幅度上升。
    各地煤矿在推行井下办公制度中，为了形成坚强的生产前线指挥中心，一般都作到了干部分班轮流，一跟到底。每班都有一个“主帅”，并且特别加强了夜班力量。这样便于加强现场政治思想工作和生产组织工作，及时解决问题，夺取班班高产。天府煤矿一井将全井党、政、工、团的干部和掘进、采煤、机电、通风、运输、供应等各个部门的领导干部统一组织起来分成三个班跟班劳动，领导生产，每个班都有二至三个井一级的主要负责干部负责全班的生产指挥工作，每个班都有成套的职能人员。因此大大加强了生产现场的指挥调度工作，发现问题和解决问题比过去更加及时。全矿10月1日至5日原煤产量，比9月最后五天增长21.5％。
    许多煤矿在学习鱼田堡的经验中，进一步将干部和群众“四同”的作法总结为“五结合”，即参加劳动和解决问题、帮助提高基层干部能力相结合；劳动和进行现场政治思想工作相结合；劳动和关心群众生活相结合；劳动和包干完成任务相结合；蹲点和转面相结合。永荣矿务局荣昌煤矿党总支把第一线的干部分别划到三个采煤班、三个掘进工作面和三个运输班去包产量、包思想、包生活、包循环作业、包深眼作业。井的负责干部也采取大半时间驻点小半时间跑面的办法，使点面更好结合。这样作后，使全矿出现了问题发现得快、关键解决得快、经验推广得快的“三快”情况，和生产上产量高、工效高、工人生产热情高的“三高”景象。
    各地煤矿在学习推广鱼田堡的经验时，都特别重视学习鱼田堡干部深入井下帮助工人订立小组公约的经验。江津、绵阳、温江、涪陵等几个专区的煤矿在几天内就普遍制订了小组公约。永川县各煤矿实行小组公约以后，原煤平均日产水平提高了18.32％。曾家山煤矿学习鱼田堡经验订出小组公约后，作到了班前准备、班中生产、班末交接，生产提高了10％。（附图片）
