    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to the Albanian Telegraph Agency, wheat sowing has begun in many regions of Albania. Thanks to the mobilization of all efforts by agricultural workers, the use of more agricultural machinery than in the past, and favorable weather conditions, the sowing work is progressing smoothly. Efforts are now being made to complete the sowing work in the shortest possible time.
    This autumn, the area sown using seeding machines from machinery and tractor stations will be double that of the same period last year. Among the various measures to strive for high yields, special attention is being paid to strengthening seed selection this year. The state has taken the necessary measures to ensure that the number of carefully selected wheat seeds this year is more than double that of last year. State farms and agricultural cooperatives have done well in this regard.
    Albanian farmers are also harvesting new cotton. Last year's cotton harvest increased by 50% compared to 1955, and this year's harvest is expected to be even greater.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 14th: Farmers in North Vietnam, under the slogan of "using late crops to supplement early crops," have exceeded the annual planting plan for coarse grains and economic crops, with planted areas significantly exceeding those of last year.
    To date, a total of more than 467,000 mu of corn, root crops, beans, peanuts, sesame, castor beans, and other crops have been planted in the North. Among them, root crops, sesame, soybeans, hemp, and castor beans have all exceeded their annual planting plans.

    越南超额完成杂粮和经济作物种植计划
    新华社讯　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社讯：阿尔巴尼亚的许多地区已经开始播种小麦。由于农业劳动者动员了全部力量，使用了比过去更多的农业机器，加上气候条件良好，播种工作进行得很顺利，现在正在争取在最短的时间内完成播种工作。
    今年秋天，使用机器拖拉机站的播种机进行播种的面积将比去年同期增加一倍。在各种争取高产的措施中，今年特别注意加强选种工作。国家已经采取必要措施，争取使今年精选出的麦种比去年多一倍。在这方面，国营农场和农业合作社的工作做得很好。
    阿尔巴尼亚农民还正在收获新棉。去年棉花收获量比1955年增加了50％，而今年的收成可望有更大的增加。
