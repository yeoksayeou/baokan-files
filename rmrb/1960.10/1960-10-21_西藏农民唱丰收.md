Tibetan Farmers Sing of the Harvest

The first harvest season after the democratic reforms has arrived on the Tibetan Plateau. In these days, the joyous songs of celebrating the harvest and praising the leadership of the Party resound everywhere.

(1)
　　The red sun rises in the East,
　　Golden light shines on both banks of the Nimu River,
　　The crops fill the threshing ground, and the granaries are full of grain,
　　The harvest is all thanks to the Communist Party.

(2)
　　No worries about food or clothing,
　　Granaries full of grain, mountains full of songs,
　　Mutual aid and cooperation are established,
　　Celebrating the prosperous year with joy.

(3)
　　The "Eight-Character Charter" shines brightly,
　　Every household has granaries full of grain,
　　Accumulating fertilizer, building canals, and engaging in large-scale production,
　　The emancipated serfs are overjoyed.
　　The people of the motherland created this treasure,
　　What a wonderful treasure,
　　Tibetan farmers hold it,
　　And barren stony mountains also blossom.

    西藏农民唱丰收
    民主改革后的第一个丰收季节来到了西藏高原。这些日子里，到处都响彻着喜庆丰收，歌颂党的领导的欢乐歌声。
    （一）
    东方升起了红太阳，
    尼木河两岸放金光，
    庄稼满场粮满仓，
    丰收全靠共产党。
    （二）
    不愁吃啊不愁穿，
    粮食满仓歌满山，
    互助合作办起来，
    欢欢喜喜庆丰年。
    （三）
    “八字宪法”放红光，
    家家户户粮满仓，
    积肥修渠大生产，
    翻身农奴喜洋洋。
    祖国人民创造了这一件宝贝，
    多好的宝贝呀，
    西藏农民拿着它，
    荒滩石山也开花。
