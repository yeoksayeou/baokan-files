Xinhua News Agency, October 13th, New York: The United Nations General Assembly continued its general political debate on the morning of the 12th. The first to speak was Mamadou Aw, head of the delegation of the young African nation, the Republic of Mali.

The head of the delegation of the Republic of Mali sternly refuted the Western countries' nonsense about the so-called "civilizing role" that imperialists played in the colonies. He emphasized that the independence of the colonial people was not due to the "magnanimity" of the colonialists, but the result of their persistent and arduous struggle.

Aw then pointed out that the Republic of Mali believes that certain events at this session of the United Nations cannot but surprise people. He said that the General Assembly had passed incorrect and harmful resolutions, obstructing the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

Aw severely condemned the imperialist conspiracy to interfere in the Congo. He pointed out that some people were trying to use the United Nations forces to overthrow the legitimate central government of the Congo and replace it with a puppet government that met the needs of the imperialists. He supported the Guinean President's request to allow a delegation representing the government of the Congo to participate in the current session of the General Assembly.

Aw pointed out that France should be held responsible for the split of the former Mali Federation. He emphasized that no provocation by France could cause Mali and its brotherly nation, Senegal, to engage in internal strife. He demanded that the United Nations should urge the immediate cessation of the colonialist war in Algeria and guarantee the free will of the Algerian people.

The representative of the Republic of Mali emphasized that the current session of the General Assembly should take effective measures to completely eliminate colonialism. He said that his delegation would vote in favor of all proposals that set a deadline for the elimination of colonialism in those places where colonial rule still exists.

The representative of the Republic of Mali said that his people are full of determination to build a new life, full of determination to establish their own economy based on a planned economy. It will make many efforts to get rid of the backwardness left by colonial rule.

Aw then pointed out that the Republic of Mali warmly supports all proposals aimed at ensuring complete and thorough disarmament. It will establish relations with other countries on the basis of respect for sovereignty, cooperation, and friendship.

In his speech, Swedish Foreign Minister Undén, referring to the situation in the Congo, expressed full support for the actions of the "United Nations forces" in the Congo, and insisted that the Secretary-General of the United Nations had resolutely and impartially implemented the tasks given to him by the Security Council. The Swedish Foreign Minister also expressed opposition to changing the structure of the United Nations.

In his speech, Ceylon representative Corea pointed out that the United Nations should take measures to ensure the unity and territorial integrity of the Congo. Corea admitted that Hammarskjöld had made "some mistakes" in the Congo, but he opposed reorganizing the structure of the United Nations Secretariat.

Corea said that his government supports the resolution on eliminating the colonial system and demands a halt to the arms race.

    马里共和国代表团团长阿乌在联大发言
    争取独立要依靠人民艰苦斗争
    殖民主义者决不会“宽宏大量”
    谴责帝国主义干涉刚果  要求保障阿尔及利亚人民自由意志
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议12日上午继续进行一般性政治辩论。第一个发言的是年青的非洲国家——马里共和国代表团团长马马杜·阿乌。
    马里共和国代表团团长严正驳斥了西方国家代表关于帝国主义者在殖民地起了所谓“文明作用”这样一种胡说。他着重指出，殖民地人民获得独立不是出于殖民主义者的“宽宏大量”，而是他们进行顽强艰苦斗争的结果。
    阿乌接着指出说，马里共和国认为本届联合国会议的某些事件不能不使人们感到惊讶。他说，大会通过了不正确的和有害的决议，阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。
    阿乌严厉谴责帝国主义干涉刚果的阴谋。他指出，有人企图利用联合国军队推翻合法的刚果中央政府，代之以一个符合帝国主义者需要的傀儡政府。他支持几内亚总统的要求，允许代表刚果政府的代表团参加大会本届会议。
    阿乌指出，法国应对前马里联邦的分裂负责。他强调说，法国的任何挑衅都不能使马里和它的兄弟之邦塞内加尔发生阋墙之争。他要求，联合国应促使立即停止阿尔及利亚的殖民主义战争，并且保障阿尔及利亚人民的自由意志。
    马里共和国代表强调说，联大本届会议应当采取有效的措施来彻底消灭殖民主义。他说，我国代表团将投票赞成确定在仍然存在殖民主义统治的那些地方消灭殖民主义的期限的一切提案。
    马里共和国代表说，我国人民充满着建设新生活的决心，充满着建立以计划经济为基础的自己经济的决心。它将作出许多的努力来摆脱殖民主义统治所遗留下来的落后状况。
    阿乌接着指出，马里共和国热情地支持一切旨在保证全面彻底裁军的建议。它将在尊重主权、合作和友谊的基础上同其他的国家建立关系。
    瑞典外交大臣恩顿在他的发言中提到刚果局势时表示完全赞同“联合国军”在刚果的行动，并硬说，联合国秘书长坚决地和公正地执行了安理会给他的任务。瑞典外交大臣还表示反对改变联合国的结构。
    锡兰代表科里亚在发言中指出，联合国应当采取措施，以确保刚果的统一和领土完整。科里亚承认，哈马舍尔德在刚果犯了“一些错误”，但是他反对改组联合国秘书处的结构。
    科里亚说，他的政府支持关于消灭殖民主义制度的决议并且要求停止军备竞赛。
