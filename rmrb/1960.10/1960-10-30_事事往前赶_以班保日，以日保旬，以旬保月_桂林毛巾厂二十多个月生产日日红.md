    Strive Ahead in Everything: Guarantee the Day with the Shift, the Decade with the Day, and the Month with the Decade
    Guilin Towel Factory Achieves Over Twenty Months of "Daily Red Production"
    Nanning, October 29th (Reporter from this newspaper) The Guilin Towel Factory in Guangxi has consistently adopted effective measures such as having machine maintenance teams guarantee shifts, shifts guarantee days, days guarantee decades, decades guarantee months, and months guarantee quarters. From January of last year to the present, they have continuously achieved excellent results in "daily red production."
    Vigorously grasping enterprise management and establishing a complete set of advanced enterprise management systems is an important guarantee for this factory to achieve "daily red production." Each production team in this factory strives to achieve a "red opening" every decade, with daily output higher than the average daily plan, and the output in the first decade of each month higher than the average decade plan, and the daily, decade, and monthly plans are implemented down to the team and to the individual. At the same time, they have also improved the methods of formulating plans and established new regulations for plan management. They stipulate that the 20th to 23rd of each month is the time for the factory to compile the plan for the next month, the 24th to 25th is the time for leaders at all levels and the masses to discuss the plan, and the 27th to 28th is the time for the factory leaders to review, approve, and officially issue the plan. This provides ample time to make the plan management work detailed and thorough.
    Secondly, in grasping the plan, they strive to be ahead rather than lagging behind, tightly grasping the beginning. They require that the first decade, the first day, and the first shift should all exceed the average planned figures for the decade, day, and shift. In this way, they have broken the old conventions of being loose in the beginning and tight at the end, and sometimes high and sometimes low, and established a new convention of balanced production with "high in the first decade, exceeding in the middle decade, and guaranteeing in the last decade."

    事事往前赶　以班保日，以日保旬，以旬保月
    桂林毛巾厂二十多个月生产日日红
    本报南宁29日电　广西桂林毛巾厂坚持采取机保班、班保日、日保旬，旬保月，月保季的有效措施，从去年1月到目前止，连续获得生产日日红的优异成绩。
    大抓企业管理，建立一整套先进的企业管理制度，是这个厂取得生产日日红的重要保证。这个厂的每个生产班组做到每旬开门红，每日产量高于平均日计划，每月头旬产量要高于平均旬计划，并把日、旬、月计划落实到组、到人。同时，还改进了编制计划的方法，订出了计划管理的新制度。他们规定，每月20日至23日为厂部编制下月计划的时间，24日至25日为各级领导干部和群众讨论计划的时间，27日至28日为厂领导审查批准和正式下达计划的时间。这样就有充裕的时间把计划管理工作作细作好。
    其次，在抓计划中，做到赶前不赶后，紧紧抓开头。要求头一旬、头一天、头一班都要超过旬、日、班的平均计划数字。这样，就打破了生产前松后紧和时高时低的老常规，建立了“上旬高、中旬超、下旬包”的均衡生产的新常规。
