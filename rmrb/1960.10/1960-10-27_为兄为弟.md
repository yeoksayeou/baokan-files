Like Brothers

By our reporters Zhang Jie and Zhou Yongkang

July, the scenery on both sides of the Yangtze River is picturesque. A ship cut through the calm river, sailing downstream. On the deck, Lu Jinggui from Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 3 was lost in thought, the beautiful scenery of Jiangnan obviously not attracting much of his interest.

"Old Lu, thinking about the Red Flag again?" Tang Zhougen from Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 walked over.

Old Lu looked at this old competitor in the competition and said half-jokingly, "Yes, you got the Red Flag this time, but be careful we take it back..."

One of these two men is the Deputy Secretary of the Party General Branch of the Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 3, and the other is the Deputy Secretary of the Party General Branch of the Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1. These two workshops have been competitors and close comrades-in-arms for several years. The two Deputy Secretaries of the Party General Branch had just finished attending the National Small Open Hearth Furnace Appraisal Conference in Chongqing and were now on their way back to Shanghai. During this appraisal, Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 regained the National Small Open Hearth Furnace High Yield Red Flag, which had been taken by Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 3 for two years. Along the way, this matter often became the focus of their conversation.

Hearing Old Lu mention the Red Flag again, Tang Zhougen said excitedly, "I hope you catch up quickly. At that time, we will go and plant the Red Flag on your No. 3 Plant's furnace."

"Whether the Red Flag is planted on your No. 1 Plant's furnace or on our No. 3 Plant's furnace, it's the glory of the Shanghai steelworkers anyway. We must work together to keep this Red Flag."

Tang Zhougen completely agreed with Old Lu's view: "Yes, everyone is for steel, not just for the Red Flag. In the future, if you have any difficulties in production, just give us a call, and we will be there whenever you need us."

"We also guarantee to strongly support you, so that you can hold the Red Flag higher and higher." ...

The ship sailed into the Huangpu River. The two Party General Branch Secretaries stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the east wind from the sea.

Sending "Reinforcements" in the Middle of the Night

A few nights after Tang Zhougen returned to the factory, the night shift workers were fighting hard in front of the open hearth furnace. In the Party General Branch office next to the workshop, a burst of rapid telephone ringing suddenly sounded. As soon as General Branch Secretary Zhou Fukun picked up the telephone, Lu Jinggui's voice from the open hearth furnace workshop of Plant No. 3 came over: "Old Zhou, we are about to sinter the furnace bottom and are having technical difficulties. Please send a technician to help us quickly."

Zhou Fukun hung up the phone and immediately told the broadcaster: "Quick, find Xu Miaorong!"

Xu Miaorong is a master of sintering furnace bottoms in Plant No. 1, with rich experience. The furnace bottom he sinters is of good quality and has a long life. Plant No. 3, however, has not solved this problem very well in the past. After Lu Jinggui returned from Chongqing, the workers of the No. 3 plant were even more eager to catch up with Plant No. 1. The first "roadblock" encountered in production was the poor quality of the sintered furnace bottom. Several times, at the critical moment when they were about to catch up with Plant No. 1, the furnace bottom failed, and it took several hours to repair, and they still fell behind Plant No. 1. Tonight, they are going to sinter the furnace bottom again, and Lu Jinggui decided to move "reinforcements" from Plant No. 1.

When Xu Miaorong heard his name being called from the loudspeaker, he immediately went to the General Branch office. The General Branch Secretary and the workshop director told him about supporting Plant No. 3, and repeatedly instructed him: "You must sinter the furnace bottom of Plant No. 3 even better than your own furnace." Xu Miaorong considered that he was not very familiar with the furnaces in Plant No. 3, and was afraid that he would not be able to do it alone, so he took the furnace tender Yang Shengxing and went to the bus station together.

The night was already very late. When the two arrived at Plant No. 3, Zhang Qiuyuan, an old furnace tender technician from Plant No. 3, rushed up to greet them: "Master Xu, the furnace tenders of the third shift are all in front of the furnace today, and they will all listen to your command." Xu Miaorong was about to decline politely when the bell for tapping the steel rang. He immediately ran to the front of the furnace and observed the surroundings. The workers of Plant No. 3 had already completed all the preparatory work. Xu Miaorong was like a commander and a combatant, working with the workers of Plant No. 3, pulling the pipe to blow compressed air for a while, and lifting the iron shovel to spread magnesia... The workers of Plant No. 3 followed him closely, acting as his assistants and learning from his experience.

More than four hours passed, and dawn appeared in the east. The battle to sinter the furnace bottom was declared over. The workers of Plant No. 3 also mastered Xu Miaorong's advanced experience. From then on, the service life of the furnace bottom of Plant No. 3 was extended from the original two or three days to about six days, creating more favorable conditions for rapid steelmaking.

Sending Blueprints Three Times

After Xu Miaorong left, the workers of Plant No. 3 held a meeting. Some expressed that they would learn from the noble style of Plant No. 1 workers who selflessly supported fraternal factories; others said: Although we lost the Red Flag, we must also send our good things to Plant No. 1, and have the "backward help the advanced."

Later, every time the workers of Plant No. 3 went to Plant No. 1 to learn, they paid close attention to what they could contribute to Plant No. 1. Once, when the workers of Plant No. 3 were in front of the furnace in Plant No. 1, they saw that they were still repairing the furnace manually, and thought of the furnace repair machine in their own workshop.

The furnace repair machine of Plant No. 3 was originally the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel. Workshop Deputy Director Han Xinliang and others learned it during a visit to the Northeast, and improved it according to the characteristics of small open hearth furnaces. Using this furnace repair machine to repair the furnace saves time and manpower, and can greatly improve the efficiency of furnace repair.

One day, Fan Fusheng, another Deputy Secretary of the Party General Branch of the open hearth furnace workshop of Plant No. 3, talked about this matter with Cai Xingsheng, the foreman of the repair section. Fan Fusheng said: "Plant No. 1 is also a small open hearth furnace, and our furnace repair machine may be useful to them. It is best to find someone to send our blueprints over."

"Then I'll go!" Cai Xingsheng volunteered. Cai Xingsheng had participated in the modification of a set of furnace repair machines in his own workshop, so he felt that it was more appropriate for him to go, and he could exchange experience on the spot.

Unfortunately, Cai Xingsheng had to repair another set of equipment that afternoon and could not spare time to go to Plant No. 1. He was also afraid of delaying time, so he handed over a general drawing of the furnace repair machine to the worker Ma Gensheng, asked him to send it immediately, and told him: "Tell the comrades of Plant No. 1 to take a look first. If there are any problems, I will come later and discuss with them together."

However, by the time he finished repairing the equipment, it was already past three o'clock in the morning. Early the next morning, he took a large stack of detailed drawings of the furnace repair machine and rushed to Plant No. 1.

When Cai Xingsheng came to the open hearth furnace workshop of Plant No. 1, the workers of Plant No. 1 were troubled by the furnace repair machine. It turned out that the furnace repair machine of Plant No. 3 was hung on a traveling crane, but there was no traveling crane in front of the furnace in Plant No. 1. "This is a difficult problem!" Cai Xingsheng brainstormed and came up with ideas with the workers of Plant No. 1 in front of the furnace. Later, he suggested: Use a mobile ground turntable to overcome the difficulty of not having a traveling crane.

A few days later, Han Xinliang, the Deputy Director of the workshop of Plant No. 3, personally sent another batch of drawings of the parts of the furnace repair machine.

Thus, the story of Plant No. 3 sending blueprints three times spread among the people. The people who sent the blueprints three times, from workers and foremen to workshop deputy directors, truly everyone attached importance to it; and the blueprints sent three times, from general drawings, detailed drawings to parts drawings, were truly more and more thorough. The workers of Plant No. 3 took the initiative to think about the open hearth furnace of Plant No. 1 in this way, and cared about the open hearth furnace of Plant No. 1 as if it were their own furnace.

Co-Refining "Friendship Steel"

On an afternoon in mid-September, a striking red bulletin was posted at the gate of the open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1, which read: "Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 and No. 3 Quick Refining Grand Performance", "Steel Name: Friendship Steel".

In front of the furnace, Zhong Daming, the youth class furnace leader of Plant No. 1, and Niu Zhongfa, the youth class furnace leader of Plant No. 3, stood side by side.

The molten steel was boiling in the open hearth furnace. It was time to add the ingredients. Zhong Daming waved his hand, and the heavy furnace door rose. The surging molten steel was tightly blocked in the furnace by a gray-white "threshold". Seeing this "threshold", Zhong Daming couldn't help but glance at his old comrade-in-arms Niu Zhongfa. It turned out that this method was learned by Plant No. 1 from Plant No. 3. It not only eliminated the "running steel" accidents in front of the furnace, but also increased the furnace output...

The battle in front of the furnace became more and more intense. The young steelworkers from the two factories formed a long line, throwing lime into the furnace one after another. After four steel samples were taken, the two young furnace leaders nodded in satisfaction.

The time for tapping the steel had arrived. In the "dang dang" bell sound, Niu Zhongfa followed closely behind Zhong Daming, with more concentration. Because he came to Plant No. 1 to make steel with the workers this time to learn once again the advanced operation method of "desulfurization outside the furnace" of Plant No. 1. And this operation method can only be seen in the instant of tapping the steel. Zhong Daming and his companions also knew Niu Zhongfa's intention. Although this operation only took a few seconds, he did it very carefully, with neat hands and feet, so that Niu Zhongfa could see it clearly...

A beam of red light shot into the sky, and the dazzling molten steel illuminated the entire workshop, rushing into the steel ladle at once. In this short moment, Niu Zhongfa once again clearly saw Zhong Daming's superb desulfurization technology.

Seeing it is seeing it, but when the workers of Plant No. 3 use it on their own furnaces, it is always unstable. This matter made the workers of the two workshops very anxious. The workers of Plant No. 1 were anxious because they also had the responsibility if this experience could not blossom and bear fruit in the furnaces of Plant No. 3; and the workers of Plant No. 3 were anxious because the desulfurization outside the furnace of Plant No. 1 was obviously a good experience, and the other party had taught it more than once, but they still did not learn it deeply or thoroughly and could not master it.

Soon after, the young class furnace leaders of the two open hearth furnace workshops met again at the open hearth furnace of Plant No. 3. They cooperated again to co-refine a furnace of "Friendship Steel". This time, the workers of Plant No. 3 were the main force, and the workers of Plant No. 1 assisted them in the operation while carefully observing the desulfurization method of the workers of Plant No. 3. The two sides diagnosed together and found the problem. The workers of Plant No. 3 finally mastered this advanced experience, and the smelting time of each furnace of steel was shortened by nearly 20 minutes.

The open hearth furnace workshops of these two factories are as close as brothers, sharing weal and woe. Every furnace of steel they refine contains the wisdom of the workers of the two workshops, shining with the light of communist cooperation. Now, the four open hearth furnaces of the two workshops have all entered the national advanced ranks, like four steel flowers, emitting dazzling light on both sides of the Huangpu River.

    为兄为弟
    本报记者　张杰　周永康
    7月，长江两岸景色如画。一艘轮船划破平静的江水，顺流而下。甲板上，上钢三厂的鲁金桂正在凝神沉思，那山明水秀的江南风光，显然没有引起他多大的兴趣。
    “老鲁，又在想红旗啦？”上钢一厂的唐周根走了过来。
    老鲁看了看这个竞赛的老对手，半开玩笑地说：“对，你们这次得了红旗，可要当心再被我们夺回来……。”
    这两个人，一个是上钢三厂平炉车间的党总支副书记，一个是上钢一厂平炉车间的党总支副书记。这两个车间几年来一直是竞赛的对手，又是亲密的战友。两个党总支副书记刚在重庆开完了全国小型平炉评比会议，这时正在返回上海的途中。在这次评比中，上钢一厂把被上钢三厂夺去了有两年之久的全国小型平炉高产红旗，重新夺了回来。一路上，这件事常常成为他们两个人谈话的中心。
    唐周根听老鲁又提起红旗的事，兴奋地说：“希望你们赶快追上来。那时候，我们就去把红旗插在你们三厂的炉子上。”
    “红旗插在你们一厂的炉子上，或者插在我们三厂的炉子上，反正一样，都是上海钢铁工人的光荣。我们一定要同心协力，保住这面红旗。”
    唐周根完全同意老鲁的看法：“对，大家都是为了钢，又不是光为了红旗。以后，你们生产中有啥困难，只要打个电话来，我们随叫随到。”
    我们也保证大力支持你们，让你们红旗越举越高。”……
    轮船驶进了黄浦江。两个党总支书记迎着海上送来的东风，肩并肩地站着。
    半夜派　“援兵”
    唐周根回厂几天以后的一个晚上，夜班工人正在平炉前面奋战。紧靠着车间的党总支办公室里，忽然响起了一阵急促的电话铃声。总支书记周富坤刚拿起电话筒，就传来了三厂平炉车间鲁金桂的声音：“老周，我们马上就要烧结炉底，技术上有困难，请你们赶快支援一个技师。”
    周富坤挂断了电话，马上告诉广播员：“快找徐妙荣！”
    徐妙荣是一厂平炉烧结炉底的能手，经验丰富。他烧结的炉底，质量好，寿命长。而三厂呢，这个问题过去还没有很好地解决。鲁金桂从重庆回来以后，三厂平炉工人追一厂的劲头更大更猛了。而生产中遇到的第一个“拦路虎”，就是烧结炉底质量不高。有几次，在快要赶上一厂的紧要关口，炉底不争气，停下来一修就是几个小时，结果还是落在一厂后面。今天晚上，又要烧结炉底了，鲁金桂决定向一厂搬“援兵”。
    徐妙荣听到扩音喇叭里传出叫他的声音，便立即赶到总支办公室。总支书记、车间主任把支援三厂的事告诉他，并且再三嘱咐：“你一定要把三厂的炉底烧结得比自己的炉子还要好。”徐妙荣考虑到三厂的炉子自己不太熟悉，一个人怕不行，便把护炉员杨盛兴找上，一块向汽车站奔去。
    夜已经很深了。两个人赶到三厂，等在门口的三厂老护炉技师张秋远一个箭步迎了上来：“徐师傅，今天三班的护炉员都在炉前，全听你指挥。”徐妙荣刚想谦让几句，出钢的钟声响了。他马上奔到炉前，四周观察了一番。准备工作，三厂工人已经全部做好。徐妙荣像个指挥员，又像个战斗员，和三厂工人一起，一会儿拉过管子吹压缩空气，一会儿提起铁锨铺镁砂……。三厂的工人紧紧地跟着他，一面做他的助手，一面学他的经验。
    四个多小时过去了，东方现出了曙光。烧结炉底的战斗宣告结束。三厂的工人也掌握了徐妙荣的先进经验。从这开始，三厂平炉炉底的使用寿命从原来的两、三天延长到六天左右，为快速炼钢创造了更有利的条件。
    三次送图纸
    徐妙荣走了以后，三厂工人们开了个会。有的人表示，要学习一厂工人无私地支援兄弟厂的崇高风格；有的说：我们虽然失掉了红旗，也要把自己的好东西送给一厂，来一个“后进帮先进”。
    以后，三厂工人每次到一厂学习的时候，都十分留意自己有什么东西可以贡献给一厂。有一次，三厂的工人在一厂炉前，看到他们还在用人工补炉，就想起了自己车间里的补炉机。
    三厂的补炉机，原来是鞍钢的经验。车间副主任韩忻亮等几个人在东北参观时学了回来，又根据小型平炉的特点作了改进。用这种补炉机补炉，既省时间，又省人力，可以大大提高补炉效率。
    一天，三厂平炉车间另一个党总支副书记范复胜和检修工段工长蔡杏生谈起了这件事。范复胜说：“一厂也是小平炉，我们这台补炉机对他们可能有用处。最好找个人把我们的图纸送过去。”
    “那我去！”蔡杏生自告奋勇地说。蔡杏生参加过自己车间里一套补炉机的改制工作，所以他感觉自己去比较合适，可以当场交流经验。
    不巧，当天下午蔡杏生要修另外一套设备，腾不出时间到一厂去。他又唯恐耽误时间，便把补炉机的一张总图交给工人马根生，叫他立即送去，并且告诉他：“你对一厂的同志说，让他们先看一看，有问题我随后就到，和他们一起商量。”
    可是，等他修好设备，已经是深夜三点多钟了。第二天一清早，他就带了一大叠补炉机的分图，赶到一厂。
    蔡杏生来到一厂平炉车间，一厂的工人正在为补炉机的事为难。原来，三厂的补炉机是吊在行车上用的，而一厂炉前没有行车。“这倒是个难题！”蔡杏生就在炉前和一厂工人一起动脑筋、想办法。后来，他提了个建议：采用活动的地上转盘，来克服没有行车的困难。
    过了几天，三厂车间副主任韩忻亮又把一批补炉机上零件的图纸，亲自送去。
    于是，三厂平炉三送图纸的故事，就在人们中间传开了。三次送图纸的人，从工人、工长到车间副主任，真是人人都重视；而三次送去的图纸，从总图、分图到零件图，真是越来越周到。三厂平炉工人就是这样处处主动为一厂平炉着想，关心一厂的平炉，就像对待自己的炉子一样。
    共炼“友谊钢”
    9月中旬的一个下午，上钢一厂平炉车间大门口，贴着一张醒目的红色快报，上面写着：“上钢一、三厂快炼大会演”、“钢名：友谊钢”。
    炉前，一厂青年班炉长钟大明和三厂青年班炉长牛仲发，并肩站在一起。
    钢水正在平炉里沸腾着。加料的时候到了。钟大明用手一挥，沉重的炉门升了起来。奔腾的钢水被一堵灰白色的“门槛”紧紧地挡在炉内。钟大明看到这个“门槛”，不禁向老战友牛仲发望了一眼。原来这种方法，是一厂从三厂学来的。它不仅消灭了炉前的“跑钢”事故，而且提高了炉产量……。
    炉前的战斗越来越紧张了，两个厂的青年炼钢工人，排成一字长蛇阵，一个接一个地往炉内投石灰。四次钢样取过，两个青年炉长满意地点点头。
    出钢的时间到了。在“当当”的钟声中，牛仲发紧跟在钟大明的后面，注意力更加集中。因为他这次来和一厂工人一起炼钢，就是为了再一次学习一厂“炉外脱硫”的先进操作方法。而这个操作方法只有在出钢时的一刹那才能看到。钟大明和他的同伴们也知道牛仲发的这个心思。尽管这一操作只有几秒钟的时间，但他做得非常认真，手脚干净利落，好让牛仲发看得一清二楚……。
    一道红光冲天，耀眼的钢水照亮了整个车间，一下子冲进了盛钢桶。就在这短短一瞬间，牛仲发又一次清楚地看到了钟大明精湛的脱硫技术。
    看是看到了，可是三厂的工人回到自己炉子上运用起来，老是不稳定。这件事使两个车间的工人都很着急。一厂工人着急的是：这个经验没能在三厂的炉子上开花结果，自己也有责任；而三厂工人着急的是：一厂的炉外脱硫，明明是个好经验，对方也曾经不止一次地传授过，而自己还是学得不深不透，掌握不了。
    不久以后，两个平炉车间的青年班炉长又在三厂的平炉上会师了。他们再度合作，共炼一炉“友谊钢”。这次以三厂工人为主，一厂工人一面协助他们操作，一面仔细观察三厂工人的脱硫方法。双方一起会诊，找到了问题所在。三厂工人终于掌握了这项先进经验，每炉钢的冶炼时间缩短了近二十分钟。
    这两个厂的平炉车间像兄弟一般的亲密，同呼吸，共欢乐。他们炼出的每一炉钢水里，都包含着两个车间工人的智慧，闪烁着共产主义大协作的光芒。现在，两个车间的四座平炉都跨入了全国先进的行列，像四朵钢花一样，在黄浦江两岸，发出耀眼的光辉。（附图片）
