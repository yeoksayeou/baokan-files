    Mount Tai Stands Tall
    Lin Xu
    Recently, I have been continuously reading several revolutionary memoirs describing the Battle of Yan'an: "A Million Soldiers in My Heart," "The Great Turning Point," "Wise Foresight," and today's published "The Qinghuabian Ambush." Then, I repeatedly read "Two Documents of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Temporarily Abandoning Yan'an and Defending the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region" (see "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, page 1217). After reading them, my thoughts were surging, and I could not calm down for a long time. When the Kuomintang reactionaries frantically invaded the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the Party Central Committee made the following decision:
      "1. It is imperative to defend and develop the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the Northwest Liberated Area with a firm fighting spirit, and this goal is entirely achievable.
      2. Our Party Central Committee and the Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army must continue to remain in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. This area has a strategically important terrain, good mass conditions, and a large maneuvering area, and safety is fully guaranteed.
      3. At the same time, for the convenience of work, a Central Working Committee should be organized with Comrade Liu Shaoqi as the secretary, to proceed to northwest Shanxi or other suitable locations to carry out the work entrusted by the Central Committee."
    Our beloved Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, in the difficult years of the revolutionary war, how firmly and wisely did they fight for the interests of the people of the whole country!
    I closed the book and pondered, facing a giant painting entitled "Battling North and South." This painting depicts Chairman Mao leading the People's Liberation Army and the people to fight north and south, firmly defending the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the interests of the Chinese people's revolution. The boundless mountains, the steep and rugged rocks, and the majestic sea of clouds constitute a magnificent landscape. Our great leader Chairman Mao stood on a giant rock, looking ahead with his head held high, gazing at victory. No matter how wonderful the painting, no matter how profound the artistic conception, it is difficult to perfectly reflect Chairman Mao's firm revolutionary spirit. However, "High mountains are admired, and noble conduct is followed." Recalling those severe days of defending the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, how can our hearts be calm?
    No matter what frantic steps the enemy took, the Party Central Committee still stood firm in northern Shaanxi, and Chairman Mao still stood firm in northern Shaanxi. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao continued to direct the People's Liberation War on all fronts of the country from northern Shaanxi, directly leading the Northwest People's Liberation Army and the people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and smashed the enemy's attacks. This firm revolutionary will and the revolutionary belief in victory will always be a very precious quality of our proletarian party. It is precisely by relying on this firm revolutionary spirit and this belief in inevitable victory that we have the determination and strength to overcome any enemy and any difficulty through unswerving struggle and carry the revolutionary cause through to the end.
    The firm revolutionary will and the revolutionary confidence in victory are not generated out of thin air, because we believe: "The patriotic, just, and revolutionary nature of the People's Liberation Army's war is bound to win the support of the people of the whole country. This is the political basis for defeating Chiang Kai-shek." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, page 1246). For a revolutionary, how to correctly understand the objective situation and how to properly estimate the enemy's and our own strength has always been a very important issue. When the Kuomintang reactionaries attacked the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, they concentrated more than 230,000 troops, while the Northwest People's Liberation Army at that time had only more than 20,000 troops in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. If we only look at the comparison of military strength, it is clear that the enemy had the advantage and the People's Liberation Army was at a disadvantage. Many of our friends and comrades, facing this dangerous situation, could not help but worry and sweat for Chairman Mao. However, Chairman Mao, with great wisdom and courage, remained as stable as Mount Tai. Chairman Mao said: "The Communist Party of China, based on the science of Marxism-Leninism, soberly assessed the international and domestic situation and knew that the attacks of all internal and external reactionaries must not only be defeated, but also could be defeated. When dark clouds appear in the sky, we point out: this is only a temporary phenomenon, the darkness is about to pass, and dawn is ahead." When we temporarily abandoned Yan'an, the enemy was truly jubilant and complacent. However, no matter how the reactionaries bared their teeth and claws and were temporarily rampant, they would eventually move towards extinction, and no force could save their dying fate. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The reason why the Kuomintang takes these steps is not at all to show the strength of the Kuomintang rule, but to show that the crisis of the Kuomintang rule has become unusually profound." "Chiang Kai-shek is at the end of his rope and wants to use the two methods of opening the 'National Congress' and attacking Yan'an to attack our Party and strengthen himself. In fact, it will backfire." "Chiang Kai-shek is walking his own path to ruin. By opening the 'National Congress' and attacking Yan'an, all his deceptions have been exposed, which is conducive to the development of the People's Liberation War." These brilliant predictions of Chairman Mao powerfully encouraged the fighting will of the people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the people of the whole country! It powerfully enhanced the people's confidence in victory. Under the encouragement of this great force, the People's Liberation Army and the masses of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, in the battle to defend the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, attracted ten times their own strength, eliminated about 100,000 enemy troops, and powerfully supported other battlefields. Chiang Kai-shek's frantic attack dug a grave for his own demise.
    Chairman Mao said: "This area has a strategically important terrain, good mass conditions, and a large maneuvering area, and safety is fully guaranteed." Chairman Mao said this, of course, not simply to reassure everyone. But especially to soberly see that the timing (the sky of the liberated area), the terrain (strategically important terrain), and the people (mass conditions) are all favorable to us and unfavorable to the enemy, and the revolutionary forces, through their own efforts, can completely be sure of victory. The victory or defeat of a war is not determined by the strength or weakness of the military forces of both sides, but by the nature of the war and the will of the people. A just war, a revolutionary war, will win; an unjust war, a war against the people, will be defeated. The Battle of Yan'an is a vivid historical teaching material.
    Revolutionary firmness and confidence in victory precisely stem from this Marxist-Leninist worldview and the viewpoint of scientifically analyzing objective laws.
    Victory will always belong to the most steadfast revolutionaries. Let us learn the revolutionary steadfast spirit of Mao Zedong Thought from the textbooks of thousands of pages of history, further strengthen the revolutionary will from the actual struggle of every moment, and stand as firm as Mount Tai at any time.

    泰山屹立
    林旭
    最近连续读了几篇描写延安保卫战的革命回忆录：《胸中自有雄兵百万》、《伟大的转折》、《英明的预见》以及今天发表的《青化砭伏击战》。接着，又反复地阅读了《中共中央关于暂时放弃延安和保卫陕甘宁边区的两个文件》（见《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一二一七页）。读后，浮想联翩，久久不能平静。在国民党反动派疯狂地进犯陕甘宁边区的时候，党中央作出了这样的决定：
      “一、必须用坚决战斗精神保卫和发展陕甘宁边区和
  西北解放区，而此项目的是完全能够实现的。
      二、我党中央和人民解放军总部必须继续留在陕甘宁
  边区。此区地形险要，群众条件好，回旋地区大，安全方
  面完全有保障。
      三、同时，为着工作上的便利，以刘少奇同志为书记，
  组织中央工作委员会，前往晋西北或其他适当地点进行中
  央委托之工作。”
    我们亲爱的党中央、毛主席，在艰苦的革命战争年代里，多么坚定、多么英明地为全国人民的利益进行着战斗！
    我合上书，面对着一幅题名为《转战南北》的巨画沉思起来。这幅画表现的正是毛主席领导人民解放军和人民群众南征北战，坚定不移地保卫着陕甘宁边区，保卫着中国人民革命的利益。一望无际的山峦，险峻嶙峋的岩石，大气磅礴的云海，构成了一幅巍峨壮丽的河山。我们伟大的领袖毛主席屹立在巨岩之上，昂首注视着前方，注视着胜利。无论多么精彩的绘画，多么深刻的意境，都是难以完美地反映毛主席坚定的革命精神的。然而“高山仰止，景行行止”，回忆起保卫陕甘宁边区的那些严峻的日子，我们的心情又怎能平静？
    任凭敌人采取怎样疯狂的步骤，但是党中央仍然屹立在陕北，毛主席仍然屹立在陕北。党中央和毛主席从陕北继续指挥了全国各个战线的人民解放战争，直接领导西北人民解放军和陕甘宁边区的人民群众，粉碎了敌人的进攻。这种坚定的革命意志，必胜的革命信念，永远是我们无产阶级政党的一种非常宝贵的品德。正是靠着这种坚决的革命精神，靠着这种必然胜利的信念，所以才有决心，有力量经过矢志不渝地斗争战胜任何敌人，克服任何困难，把革命事业进行到底。
    坚定的革命意志和必胜的革命信心，不是凭空产生的，因为我们相信：“人民解放军的战争所具有的爱国的正义的革命的性质，必然要获得全国人民的拥护。这就是战胜蒋介石的政治基础。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1246页）。对于一个革命者来说，如何正确地认识客观形势，如何恰当地估计敌我力量，从来都是一个十分重要的问题。国民党反动派进攻陕甘宁边区的时候，集中了二十三万多人的兵力，而当时西北人民解放军在陕甘宁边区的部队只不过两万多人。如果仅仅从兵力的对比上来看，显然敌人占着优势，人民解放军处于不利的地位。我们的朋友、我们的同志中不少人面对着这个险恶形势，也不免忧心忡忡，为毛主席挥一把冷汗。然而，大智大勇的毛主席稳如泰山。毛主席说：“中国共产党依据马克思列宁主义的科学，清醒地估计了国际和国内的形势，知道一切内外反动派的进攻，不但是必须打败的，而且是能够打败的。当着天空中出现乌云的时候，我们就指出：这不过是暂时的现象，黑暗即将过去，曙光即在前头。”当我们暂时放弃延安的时候，敌人真正兴高采烈，得意忘形了。然而，不管反动派怎样张牙舞爪、疯狂一时，终究会走向灭亡的，任何力量都挽救不了它们垂死的命运。毛主席指出：“国民党之所以采取这些步骤，丝毫不是表示国民党统治的强有力，而是表示国民党统治的危机业已异常深刻化。”“蒋介石日暮途穷，欲以开‘国大’、打延安两项办法，打击我党，加强自己。其实，将适得其反。”“蒋介石自走绝路，开‘国大’、打延安两着一做，他的一切欺骗全被揭破，这是有利于人民解放战争的发展的。”毛主席这些英明预见，有力地鼓舞了陕甘宁边区人民和全国人民的斗争意志！有力地增强了人民群众的胜利信心。在这个巨大的力量鼓舞下，人民解放军和陕甘宁边区的群众，在保卫陕甘宁边区的战斗中，吸引了十倍于己的兵力，消灭了敌军约十万人，并且有力地支援了其他战场。蒋介石的疯狂进攻，为自己的灭亡挖下了坟墓。
    毛主席说：“此区地形险要，群众条件好，回旋地区大，安全方面完全有保障。”毛主席讲这些当然不是单纯地为了安大家的心。而特别是清醒地看到：天时（解放区的天）、地利（地形险要）、人和（群众条件）都是有利于我，而不利于敌，革命力量经过自己的努力，完全能够稳操胜券。战争的胜负不决定于双方军事力量的强大与弱小，而决定于战争的性质和人心的向背。正义的战争、革命的战争必胜；不义的战争，反人民的战争必败。延安保卫战，是一个生动的历史教材。
    革命的坚定性和必胜的信心，正是从这种马克思列宁主义的世界观和对客观规律进行科学分析的观点出发的。
    胜利永远属于最坚定的革命者。让我们从千百页历史的教课书中学习毛泽东思想的革命坚定精神，从每时每刻的实际斗争中更加坚定革命的意志，在任何时候都像泰山一样，巍然屹立。
