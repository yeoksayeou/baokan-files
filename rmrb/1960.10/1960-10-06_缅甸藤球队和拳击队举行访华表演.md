Xinhua News Agency, 5th: The Chinlone and boxing teams of the Burmese Sports Delegation held their second performance in China at the Beijing Gymnasium competition hall tonight. The skilled techniques of the guest team's Chinlone players and the brave and tenacious style of the boxing athletes repeatedly won warm applause from the audience.

Chinlone is a folk sport in Burma. The ball is woven from rattan and is very light. It is mainly kicked with the feet, similar to the Chinese game of Jianzi. People of all ages can participate. Tonight, six famous Burmese athletes formed a circle and demonstrated various superior foot skills. Before the Chinlone ball touched the ground, they were able to continuously kick it up with their soles, heels, toes, the inside of their feet, the outside of their feet, or their knees, without letting it fall. They not only performed collective coordination techniques, but also demonstrated their own unique skills, earning the audience's repeated praise and bursts of applause.

The Burmese boxing athletes performed Burmese boxing, which differs from the internationally popular version. The athletes are barefoot and bare-fisted, without gloves, and are divided into three levels only according to the degree of technical skill, rather than by weight. During the performance, there was also accompaniment by a folk band, with the drums beating, sometimes tightly, sometimes loudly, enhancing the atmosphere of the competition.

Tonight, Li Da, Vice Chairman of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, and Lieutenant General Liao Hansheng, Lieutenant General Zhang Nansheng, Lieutenant General Li Zuopeng, Major General Xu Wenlie, and Major General Li Xin of the Chinese People's Liberation Army attended and watched the performance. After the performance, they went to the arena to shake hands with the Burmese athletes one by one and took photos together.

    缅甸藤球队和拳击队举行访华表演
    新华社5日讯　缅甸体育代表团藤球代表队和拳击代表队今晚在北京体育馆比赛馆举行访华第二次表演，客队藤球选手表演的熟练技巧和拳击选手的勇猛顽强作风，不时博得观众的热烈掌声。
    藤球是缅甸的一种民间体育活动，球是用藤条编成的，很轻，主要是用脚踢，方法类似我国的踢毽子，不论老少都可以参加。今晚缅甸的六名著名选手围成一圈，表演了各种上乘的脚上功夫，他们能在藤球还没落地以前，分别用脚掌、脚跟、脚尖、脚内侧、脚外侧或膝盖连续把球踢起，不使它落地。他们不仅表演了集体配合技术，而且还表演了各自的绝技，赢得观众连声称赞和阵阵的掌声。
    缅甸拳击选手表演的是缅甸拳击，与国际流行的不同，选手们赤脚空拳，不带拳套，并且只以技术程度的高低分为三个等级，而不是以体重的标准分级。表演时，还有民族乐队伴奏，鼓声咚咚，忽紧忽响，加强了竞赛的气氛。
    今晚，国家体委副主任李达和中国人民解放军廖汉生中将，张南生中将，李作鹏中将、徐文烈少将、李信少将等出席观看了表演，并且在表演结束后到运动场上同缅甸运动员一一握手，和在一起照了像。
