Xinhua News Agency, October 26th dispatch from Leopoldville: The United Nations authorities, manipulated by the United States, announced yesterday the establishment of so-called "demilitarized neutral zones" in Katanga Province of the Congo, to further interfere in the patriotic struggle of the Congolese people and expand the military occupation of the "UN forces," and to provide armed protection for the separatist activities of the Tshombe clique.

According to reports, a United Nations spokesman announced in Leopoldville on the 25th that the United Nations authorities had decided to establish two so-called "demilitarized neutral zones" controlled by "UN forces" in the northeast and central parts of Katanga Province. The first zone includes the cities of Kabalo, Nyunzu, and Manono, and the second zone includes the cities of Kongolo, Bukama, and Luena. These areas are the central areas of the patriotic struggle of the people of Katanga Province. The tribal people of Katanga Province, regardless of the suppression by the traitorous Tshombe clique and the interference of the "UN forces," have been steadfastly maintaining armed struggle to defend the independence and unity of the Congo.

The United Nations spokesman also said that within these "demilitarized neutral zones," only "UN forces" would be allowed to carry weapons. Colonel Byrne of Ireland will lead a thousand "UN forces" to "patrol" there.

Reports say that the United Nations authorities are also preparing to send reinforcements to Katanga Province. At the same time, in order to intimidate the Congolese people and strengthen military control over the Congo, the "UN forces" have recently airlifted a batch of heavy weapons to the Congo.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Leopoldville, an average of 500 Belgians are now returning to Leopoldville by plane from Brussels, the capital of Belgium, every week. In addition, some people are pouring back in large numbers from countries neighboring the Congo.

At the same time, Belgian officers are infiltrating the Congo to support rebel groups. According to UPI, five Belgian officers have joined the armored forces controlled by Mobutu in Thysville.

    企图进一步干涉刚果人民爱国斗争
    “联合国军”在加丹加省设“中立区”
    新华社26日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：美国操纵下的联合国当局昨天宣布在刚果加丹加省建立所谓“非武装中立区”，来进一步干涉刚果人民的爱国斗争和扩大“联合国军”的军事占领，武装庇护冲伯集团的分裂活动。
    据报道，联合国发言人25日在利奥波德维尔宣布，联合国当局决定在加丹加省东北部和中部建立两个由“联合国军”控制的所谓“非武装中立区”。第一个区包括卡巴洛、尼恩祖和马诺诺等城市，第二个区包括戈邦戈、布卡马和卢埃纳等城市。这些地区是加丹加省人民爱国斗争的中心地区。加丹加省的部族人民不顾冲伯卖国集团的镇压和“联合国军”的干涉，一直在那里坚持维护刚果独立统一的武装斗争。
    这个联合国发言人还说，在这些“非武装中立区”内，只有“联合国军”能携带武器。爱尔兰的伯恩上校将率领一千名“联合国军”在那里“巡逻”。
    有消息说，联合国当局还准备向加丹加省加派增援部队。同时，“联合国军”为了恫吓刚果人民和加强对刚果的军事控制，最近把一批重型武器空运到了刚果。苍蝇与痰盂　华君武
    据美联社利奥波德维尔消息透露，现在从比利时首都布鲁塞尔乘飞机回到利奥波德维尔的比利时人平均每周有五百人。另外有一些人从刚果邻近的国家大批地涌回来。
    同时，比利时军官渗入刚果，支持叛乱集团。据合众国际社透露，有五名比利时军官参加了在太斯维尔的由蒙博托控制的装甲部队。
