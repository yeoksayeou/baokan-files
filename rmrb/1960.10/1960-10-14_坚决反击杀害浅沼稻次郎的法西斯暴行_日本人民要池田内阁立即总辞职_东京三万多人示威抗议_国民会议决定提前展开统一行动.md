Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th Dispatch: Nearly 35,000 workers, ordinary citizens, and students gathered near the Diet Building and the Prime Minister's Official Residence tonight to hold a large-scale demonstration, protesting the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, and demanding the resignation of the Ikeda Cabinet. The area near the Diet was a sea of red flags and banners. Prior to the demonstration, people from all walks of life held a protest rally in Hibiya Park. The assembly unanimously passed a resolution demanding the resignation of the Ikeda Cabinet, which had opened the door to fascism, and the removal of all police officials responsible for the Asanuma assassination case.

Speaking at the rally were Hideo Yamahana, representative of the Socialist Party, Ichizo Suzuki, representative of the Communist Party, Tomitaro Kaneda, vice chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and Masahiko Sekiya, chairman of the Japan Christian Conference Against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." They unanimously expressed their indignation at the reactionaries' assassination of Asanuma.

Hideo Yamahana emphasized that the Ikeda Cabinet must not evade responsibility for this murder case merely by removing the head of the government's Public Safety Commission.

Ichizo Suzuki, in his speech, called for the establishment of anti-fascist committees in various regions and workplaces, and the strengthening of the people's united front centered on the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Pointing out that the murderer was a member of the "Asian Anti-Communist Youth League," he said that this proved that anti-communism meant hating the entire Japanese people.

Tomitaro Kaneda pointed out that the police authorities and fascist thugs are tools in the hands of the ruling class to suppress the people's movement for democracy and peace. He said that we must hold a powerful general strike to overthrow the Ikeda Cabinet.

The demonstrators shouted, "Ikeda, you cannot escape responsibility!" "Police chiefs resign!" As the demonstrators passed through the streets of downtown Tokyo, many passers-by joined the demonstration. The demonstration continued until late at night.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th Dispatch: The Japan Socialist Party held its 19th Extraordinary National Convention in Tokyo today. The convention decided to concentrate all its efforts on fighting the Ikeda Cabinet and striving to establish a peaceful and neutral government.

The convention was attended by 1,500 representatives from various regions and members of the Diet.

A huge portrait of Inejiro Asanuma, the chairman of the Socialist Party who was killed by the reactionaries, and the slogan "Let our chairman not die in vain, let us smash violence and fascism" were hung on the rostrum of the convention.

The convention began with a three-minute silence. Kato Kanju, advisor of the Socialist Party, read the eulogy. Asanuma's wife, Ryoko Asanuma, delivered a reply.

Saburo Eda, secretary-general of the Socialist Party, then read the general report drafted by Asanuma before his death. After approving the general report of Secretary-General Eda, the convention adopted the Socialist Party's policies for the extraordinary session of the Diet, the general election struggle guidelines, and a resolution to guarantee efforts to eradicate violence and fascism.

The general election struggle guidelines stipulate that the Socialist Party will fight for the establishment of a democratic and neutral government. The policies of this democratic and neutral government are to not recognize the "Security Treaty"; to uphold democracy and rebuild parliamentary politics; to democratize the economy and develop the social insurance system; to conclude peace treaties with the Soviet Union and China and establish friendly relations with all countries.

Many guests spoke at the convention. Kaoru Ota, chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), emphasized in his speech that yesterday's incident showed the ruling class's anxiety in the face of the great strength shown by the people in the movement against the revision of the "Security Treaty." He said that Asanuma's assassination exposed the true face of the Ikeda Cabinet, which has been trying to conceal its warmongering face.

Ota said that 3.7 million Sohyo workers will hold a nationwide strike on October 15 to protest against the Ikeda Cabinet. When Ota said this, the participants burst into huge cheers.

Kozo Minakuchi, secretary-general of the National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty, said, "Prime Minister Ikeda must resign immediately and take responsibility for the assassination of Asanuma and the hasty passage of the Security Treaty." He stressed that the struggle against the "Security Treaty" is not over.

Masako Yamashita, secretary-general of the Japan Mothers' Congress Liaison Committee, said: The ruling class's murder of Asanuma is a challenge to the Japanese people.

She said that the mothers of Japan will contribute to the victory of progressive forces in the upcoming general election, just as they did in the movement against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

Before the closing of the convention, all the participants shouted, "Asanuma will not die in vain!" "Ikeda must resign!"

After the convention, the participants paraded through the city carrying a portrait of the late chairman Asanuma.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th Dispatch: The "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty," composed of more than 140 political parties and mass organizations in Japan, decided today to advance the 23rd National Unified Action against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," originally scheduled for the 22nd, to the 20th, and resolutely demand the resignation of the Ikeda government, which is responsible for the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma. The 20th is the date scheduled by the Socialist Party for Asanuma's funeral.

On the Unified Action Day, Tokyo will hold a "National Congress against the 'Security Treaty' and Protesting the Murder of Asanuma."

The National Council decided that the slogans for the upcoming National Unified Action will include new slogans in addition to the originally decided "Oppose the Security Treaty, Crush the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance." The new slogans are: "We protest the murder of Asanuma and demand the immediate resignation of the Ikeda Cabinet."

The National Council has issued struggle instructions to more than 2,000 joint struggle organizations against the "Security Treaty" across the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th Dispatch: Akira Imamura, vice chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and 30 other cadres, representing Sohyo's 3.7 million members, demanded last night that the Ikeda government take responsibility for the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, chairman of the Socialist Party, and immediately implement a general resignation. The representatives also demanded the immediate dismissal of Ken Ogura, superintendent general of the Metropolitan Police Department, and other officials of the police authorities.

These solemn demands of "Sohyo" were made to Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Ohira after a meeting of leading cadres was held last night.

This most powerful trade union in Japan held a meeting of responsible persons from various industrial unions at its Tokyo headquarters today to discuss the Asanuma assassination incident, and decided on the following action policy for the current situation: Demand that the Ikeda Cabinet immediately step down and dismiss police officials such as the superintendent general of the Metropolitan Police Department; with the goal of uniting all democratic groups to fight together, hold protest rallies and parades in Tokyo and nationwide for two days today and tomorrow; during these days, each industrial union will hold a half-hour protest timed strike or workplace congress.

The National Federation of Student Self-Government Associations held an emergency meeting of the Representative Committee last night, deciding to hold continuous demonstrations and strikes nationwide starting today to express strong protest, and will hold a strike on the 15th with the participation of all members.

Five thousand students at Waseda University held a strike today, strongly protesting the fascist terrorist act of the reactionaries in killing Asanuma. Asanuma was a graduate of Waseda University, and forty years ago he was one of the student movement leaders at this university.

This morning, more than 3,000 students held a protest rally in the square in front of the auditorium, solemnly announcing that, to express protest, all students of Waseda University will hold an indefinite strike starting tomorrow. The representative of the All-Student Council of Waseda University said at the meeting: It was the Ikeda Cabinet's reactionary politics that killed Asanuma.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th Dispatch: Ikuo Yasui, director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, held a press conference today, announcing that the Council will immediately unite with relevant mass organizations to launch a nationwide movement to eradicate the breeding ground of violence that killed Inejiro Asanuma - Japanese militarism.

Yasui praised Asanuma for actively participating in the struggle for peace, and Asanuma attended the world conference for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and disarmament every time.

Yasui emphasized that no matter how the fascist forces carry out terrorist activities, the united strength of the people will eventually defeat them.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th Dispatch: Since yesterday afternoon, workers and people from all walks of life in Tokyo have spontaneously held large-scale gatherings and demonstrations, strongly protesting the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

As soon as the news of the assassination spread, batches of workers, students, and housewives continuously went to the Tokyo headquarters of the Socialist Party to express their condolences for Asanuma's death, and participated in mass demonstrations near the Diet Building. Fifty postal workers waved their fists and shouted, "We want revenge."

As soon as they received the news of Asanuma's death, the union members of the Morinaga Confectionery Company's general office immediately prepared leaflets and distributed them to pedestrians near the station. The leaflets said: "The serious incident of Asanuma's assassination is an atrocity against us workers, farmers, and all Japanese people. Let us go to Hibiya Park to participate in the demonstration and express our protest!" (Attached photo)

    坚决反击杀害浅沼稻次郎的法西斯暴行
    日本人民要池田内阁立即总辞职
    东京三万多人示威抗议　国民会议决定提前展开统一行动
    据新华社13日讯　东京消息：将近三万五千工人、普通市民和学生，今天晚间汇集在国会大厦和首相官邸附近举行大规模示威，抗议刺杀日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎，要求池田内阁总辞职。国会附近是一片红旗和标语牌的海洋。在示威以前，各界人民在日比谷公园举行了抗议大会。大会一致通过决议，要求为法西斯主义敞开大门的池田内阁辞职，并撤除应对刺杀浅沼案负责的所有警务官员的职务。
    在大会上讲话的有社会党代表山花秀雄、共产党代表铃木市藏、日本工会总评议会副议长兼田富太郎和日本基督教徒反对日美“安全条约”会议议长关屋正彦。他们对反动派暗杀浅沼一致表示愤慨。
    山花秀雄强调指出，池田内阁决不能仅仅以撤除政府公安委员会的负责人来规避为这件谋杀案而应担负的责任。
    铃木市藏在讲话中要求在各个地区和工作场所建立反法西斯委员会，并加强以社会党和共产党为核心的人民统一战线。他在指出谋杀犯是“亚洲反共青年联盟”的成员时说，这证明了反共就意味着仇视全体日本人民。
    兼田富太郎指出，警察当局和法西斯强盗们，都是掌握在统治阶级手里的、用来镇压争取民主和和平的人民运动的工具。他说，我们必须举行强有力的总罢工来推翻池田内阁。
    示威者在行进时高呼：“池田，你是逃脱不了责任的！”“警察头子辞职！”示威者路过东京闹市的各个大街时，许多过路人参加到示威游行队伍中来。示威游行一直继续到深夜。
    据新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天在东京举行第十九次临时全国代表大会。大会决定集中所有力量同池田内阁斗争，并为建立和平中立政府而奋斗。
    参加大会的有社会党各地代表和国会议员共一千五百名。
    大会主席台上挂着被反动派杀害的社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎的巨幅画像和标语：“让我们的委员长不致白死，让我们粉碎暴力和法西斯主义。”
    大会开始后首先默哀三分钟。社会党顾问加藤勘十宣读了悼词。浅沼的夫人浅沼亮子致了答词。
    社会党书记长江田三郎接着宣读了浅沼生前所起草的总报告。大会在批准书记长江田的总报告之后，通过了社会党对国会临时会议的政策、大选斗争方针和保证努力根除暴力和法西斯主义的决议。
    大选斗争方针规定社会党将为建立民主中立政府而斗争。这个民主中立政府的政策是不承认“安全条约”；拥护民主和重建议会政治；经济民主化和发展社会保险制度；同苏联和中国缔结和约并且同一切国家建立友好关系。
    许多来宾在大会上讲了话。日本工会总评议会议长太田熏在讲话中强调说，昨天的事件表现了统治阶级面对着人民在反对修改“安全条约”的运动中所显示的伟大力量的焦急心情。他说，浅沼的被刺暴露了池田内阁的本来面目，池田内阁一直在设法掩饰自己的好战面目。
    太田熏说，三百七十万总评工人10月15日将举行全国范围的大罢工，对池田内阁表示抗议。当太田熏讲到这里时，与会者发出巨大的欢呼声。
    阻止修改安全条约国民会议事务局长水口宏三说，“池田首相必须立即辞职，承担浅沼被刺和匆匆通过安全条约的责任。”他着重指出，反对“安全条约”的斗争并没有结束。
    日本母亲大会联络委员会事务局长山下正子说：统治阶级杀害浅沼是向日本人民的挑战。
    她表示日本的母亲们将像在反对修改“安全条约”的运动时那样，为进步力量在即将举行的大选中取得胜利而贡献力量。
    大会闭幕前，全体与会者高呼：“浅沼决不会白白死掉的！”“池田必须辞职！”
    代表大会结束后，与会者抬着已故委员长浅沼的遗像在市内举行了游行。
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本一百四十多个政党和群众团体组成的“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”今天决定把预定在22日举行的第二十三次反对美日“安全条约”全国统一行动提前到20日举行，坚决要求对杀害浅沼稻次郎事件负责的池田政府总辞职。20日是社会党预定为浅沼举行葬仪的日子。
    在统一行动日，东京将举行“反对‘安全条约’和抗议谋杀浅沼国民大会”。
    国民会议决定，即将举行的全国统一行动的口号除了原来已经决定的“反对安全条约、粉碎日美军事同盟”以外，还要增加新的口号。新的口号是：“我们抗议谋杀浅沼并要求池田内阁立即总辞职”。
    国民会议已经向全国各地二千多个反对“安全条约”共同斗争组织发出斗争指示。

    “总评”的这些严正的要求是在昨天晚间举行领导干部会议后，向内阁官房长官大平正芳提出的。
    这个日本全国最强大的工会今天在东京总部召开各产业工会的负责人会议，就浅沼被刺杀事件进行了讨论，并决定当前的行动方针如下：要求池田内阁立即下台和罢免警视总监等警务负责人；以联合所有民主团体共同斗争为目标，今天和明天的两天在东京及全国范围内举行抗议集会和游行；这几天中各产业工会举行半小时的抗议定时罢工或工作场所大会。

    早稻田大学的五千名学生今天举行罢课，强烈抗议反动派杀害浅沼的法西斯恐怖行为。浅沼是早稻田大学毕业生，四十年前他是这个大学的学生运动领袖之一。
    今天上午，三千多名学生在礼堂前面的广场上举行抗议大会，庄严宣布，为了表示抗议，早稻田大学全体学生将从明天起举行无限期罢课。早稻田大学全体学生协议会的代表在会上讲话时指出：是池田内阁的反动政治杀害了浅沼。
    据新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁今天举行记者招待会，宣布协议会将立即同有关群众团体联合起来展开全民性运动，以根绝杀害浅沼稻次郎的暴力的温床——日本军国主义。
