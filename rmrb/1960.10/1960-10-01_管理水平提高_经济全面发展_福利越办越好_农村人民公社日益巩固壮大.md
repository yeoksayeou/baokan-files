    Management Level Improved, Economy Comprehensively Developed, Welfare Getting Better and Better
    Rural People's Communes Increasingly Consolidated and Growing Stronger
    Over the past two years, most parts of the country have suffered continuous and severe natural disasters. People's communes, relying on the superiority of "large-scale and public ownership," have organized the vast number of commune members. Through arduous struggle, they have ensured the continued development of agricultural production and reduced losses. This is a great victory.
    (Xinhua News Agency, September 30th) The rural people's communes throughout the country are continuing to advance on the road of consolidation and sound development, increasingly showing their enormous superiority.
     In the past year, the economies of communes and teams (production brigades, the basic accounting unit, and production teams) in various regions have seen new development; the level of business management has continued to improve, and many new experiences in running communes have been gained; under the conditions of frequent natural disasters, the ability to resist natural disasters has been honed, ensuring the continued development of the agricultural economy centered on grain; and the magnificent undertaking of agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization has begun to accelerate.
    Under the guidance of the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, the economies of rural people's communes in various regions have seen new development this year. Qinghai, Xinjiang, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, and other provinces and regions, as well as a large number of communes in various provinces and regions, have expanded their cultivated land area through reclamation. A large number of communes have established enterprises that combine farming, forestry, and animal husbandry. With the support of cities and industrial, commercial, and other sectors across the country, the equipment and technology of commune-run industries have improved. With the support of cultural and educational departments, scientific research departments, and others, scientific and technological research organizations and activities in communes, mainly focused on implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," have seen wider development.
    In the economic development of communes and teams this year, rural communes in various regions have focused on developing the economy at the team (generally referred to as the production brigade or management area) level, which is the basic accounting unit, to strengthen the foundation of the commune. Party committees and commune leaders in various regions, in accordance with the policy of taking grain as the key and promoting comprehensive development, have strengthened the leadership of teams and enriched the ranks of team cadres during the rectification and management of communes in the winter of last year and the first half of this year; and they have developed diversified operations for teams on the basis of running team's agricultural production well. In order to develop team agricultural production, communes in various regions have taken measures to strengthen the labor force engaged in agricultural production in each team, ensuring that the agricultural front line of the team has a considerable labor force to expand planting and intensive cultivation, and strive to increase agricultural, especially grain, production. At the same time, communes in various regions have implemented the policy of serving agriculture as the main focus in the rectification of commune-run industries, and developed industries such as the manufacture, repair, and assembly of agricultural tools and machinery, and fertilizers and pesticides to serve team agricultural production. In the rectification of commune-run industries, communes in various regions have also handed over some of the smaller agricultural and sideline product processing industries and sideline businesses to the teams to operate. Now, the basic accounting unit of rural communes across the country—the team—all have their own industries. According to statistics from Lin County, Henan Province, in May of this year, most of the nearly a thousand industrial enterprises run by communes throughout the county were various types of smaller industrial units run by production brigades.
    This year, rural communes in various regions, with their superior conditions of being "large-scale and public ownership," have more comprehensively and systematically supported the economic development of poor teams. In addition to enriching cadres and strengthening production leadership for poor teams, they have also supported the basic farmland construction and agricultural production of poor teams with manpower, materials, and financial resources. The state's investment of 1.5 billion yuan in rural communes this year has played a significant role in this process. This spring, the Bayi Commune in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, under the slogan of "One team in difficulty, the whole commune supports," provided 50,000 yuan in production funds for five poor teams, and also helped one team repair and add more than 4,000 pieces of spring plowing agricultural tools, enabling the poor teams to expand planting area and develop agricultural production in this year's spring plowing. During the summer harvest this year, 83 poor teams in Nantong Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, had yields exceeding those of rich teams, and 320 poor teams basically caught up with the rich teams.
    This year, the level of rural communes across the country in managing production and managing the lives of commune members has improved. In terms of production, the planning work and systems for labor management and financial management are more sound and improved than before. During the summer harvest and summer planting, agricultural production plans were quickly implemented down to the contracted production units, and the "three guarantees and one reward" system was implemented. Now, the implementation of autumn sowing plans and the "three guarantees" work in various regions is also proceeding faster than last year. In terms of labor management, on the basis of vigorously strengthening agricultural field labor in various regions, the labor of most production teams, production groups, and various specialized organizations has been fixed; the implementation of the responsibility system for harvesting, planting, and field management is more widespread; and the experience in specialized and cooperative labor within communes and teams is richer. In terms of financial management, the accounting system of running communes diligently and thriftily and the system of contracted production expenses are also being vigorously promoted. Due to production development and increasingly sound financial systems, more communes and teams in various provinces and regions have achieved the monthly payment of wages to commune members this year. In terms of living, the people's communes have achieved even greater achievements this year. Public canteens, childcare organizations, homes for the elderly, health care, and other welfare undertakings have been run better and more experienced than in the past. The proper arrangement of the lives of 500 million farmers is one of the greatest superiorities of the people's communes and is also the one most supported by the vast number of farmers. This year, rural areas across the country have fully realized the communalization of public canteens on the basis of communization. Guizhou, Henan, and various provinces and regions have summarized a complete set of experiences in running canteens. Canteens in various regions have universally begun to establish their own non-staple food production bases. Because various regions have arranged the lives of commune members better and the canteens are run better this year, although some communes and teams suffered drought and reduced production last year and this summer, the communes and canteens overcame difficulties and guaranteed the lives of commune members. There are also batches of well-run red banner canteens in various regions that have improved the lives of commune members.
    Last year and this year, a large number of rural communes across the country have been severely tested by natural disasters. Last year, drought spread across 20 provinces and regions, but the people's communes still stubbornly ensured agricultural development. Among them, the communes that suffered particularly severe disasters and reduced production also tried every means to guarantee the lives of commune members this year. None of the 24,000 rural communes across the country failed to withstand such a test, fully demonstrating its tenacious growth vitality. This year's natural disasters are also frequent, with many areas in North China and Northwest China lacking rain until July; a considerable part of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Northeast China suffered relatively heavy typhoon and flood disasters. Although Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, and other regions were so dry that spring and summer sowing could not be carried out, the people's communes still tried every means to fight drought and basically completed spring and summer sowing. Two consecutive years of severe disasters, the communes stood firm, and guaranteed the lives of the vast number of farmers, and ensured the continuation of rural production. This powerfully illustrates that the people's communes have enabled our country's farmers to forever get rid of the historical fate of hundreds of millions, tens of of millions facing hunger, famine and death, which was inevitable whenever natural disasters occurred. People's communes have greatly reduced the harm of natural disasters to agricultural production, and greatly reduced losses. In the past two months, rural communes across the country have responded to the Party's call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, and have launched a production upsurge to expand planting of late autumn grain crops and autumn vegetables, strengthen autumn field management, and strive for more harvests in autumn.
    With the consolidation of the commune system, the cause of agricultural mechanization in our country has accelerated. In the past two years, the number of tractors, power irrigation and drainage machinery, cultivating machinery, small hydropower stations, and hydraulic stations used in rural areas across the country has increased significantly; since last winter, 27 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have established 110 pilot projects for agricultural machinery. Heilongjiang Province, the key area for agricultural mechanization, has seen its mechanized farming area account for more than 20% of the total cultivated land area this year. Thirty counties and some communes across the country have basically realized the mechanization or semi-mechanization of grain processing and cooking operations, and many communes have also basically realized the semi-mechanization of field operations. Under the vigorous nurturing of the Party, the rural people's communes in our country are continuing to consolidate and march forward with their heads held high.

    管理水平提高　经济全面发展　福利越办越好
    农村人民公社日益巩固壮大
    两年来，全国大部地区连续遭受严重自然灾害，人民公社依靠一大二公的优越性，组织广大社员，经过艰巨斗争，保证了农业生产的继续发展，减少了损失，这是一个很大的胜利
    据新华社30日讯　全国农村人民公社在巩固和健全发展的道路上继续前进，日益显出它的巨大的优越性。
     一年来，各地农村人民公社社和队的经济都有新的发展；经营管理水平续有提高，又取得了不少办社的新经验；在自然灾害频繁的情况下，锻炼了抗御自然灾害的本领，保证了以粮食为中心的农业经济的继续发展；并且开始加快了农业机械化和半机械化的宏伟事业。
    在以农业为基础的思想指导下，今年各地农村人民公社的经济都有新的发展。青海、新疆、福建、湖北、湖南等省区和各省区的大批公社开荒扩大了自己的耕地面积，大批公社办了一些农、林、畜牧结合经营的企业。在全国城市和工、商等方面的支援下，社办工业的设备和技术有了提高。在文教、科学研究等部门的支援下，公社中以贯彻农业八字宪法为主的科学技术研究组织和活动，有了更广泛的发展。
    今年社、队经济发展中，各地农村公社着重地发展了基本核算单位——队（一般称大队或管理区）一级的经济，以加强公社的基础。各地党委和公社领导根据以粮为纲全面发展的方针，在去年冬天和今年上半年的整社和办社工作中，都加强了队的领导，充实了队的干部；并在办好队的农业生产的基础上发展了队的多种经营。为了发展队的农业生产，各地公社都采取措施加强了各队经营农业生产的劳动力，保证队的农业第一线有相当的劳力来扩大种植和精耕细作，争取农业特别是粮食增产。同时，各地公社在整顿社办工业中贯彻执行了为农业服务为主的方针，发展了农具、农械制造修配和肥料、农药等工业来为队的农业生产服务。在整顿社办工业中，各地公社还把一些较小的农副产品加工业和副业交了一些给队经营。现在全国农村公社的基本核算单位——队都有了自己的工业。河南省林县今年5月统计，全县公社经营的近千个工业企业单位中，大部分就是大队一级经营的各类较小工业单位。
    今年，各地农村公社以其一大二公的优越条件，更全面、更有计划地扶持了穷队的经济发展。除了给穷队充实干部，加强对穷队的生产领导而外，还以人力、物力、财力支援了穷队的农田基本建设和农业生产。国家今年给农村公社的十五亿元的投资，在这中间起了很大的作用。今年春天，江西省南昌县八一公社在“一队困难全社支援”的口号下，就给五个穷队垫出了五万元的生产资金，另外还帮助一个队修理和添置了四千多件春耕农具，使穷队在今年春耕中扩大了种植面积，发展了农业生产。江苏省南通专区今年夏收时有八十三个穷队的产量超过了富队，有三百二十个穷队基本赶上了富队。
    今年，全国农村公社经营生产和管理社员生活的水平都有提高。生产方面，计划工作和劳力管理、财务管理等制度较前更加健全和完善。夏收和夏种中，农业生产计划迅速落实到包产单位，并贯彻执行三包奖励制度。现在各地的秋冬播种计划落实工作和三包工作也进行得比去年快。在劳力管理上，各地公社在大力加强农业田间劳力的基础上，大多数生产队、生产小队和各种专业组织的劳力都已固定；收、种、田间管理等责任制的推行更加普遍；社队以内专业和协作劳动的经验更加丰富。在财务管理上，勤俭办社的核算制和生产开支的包干制也正大力推行。由于生产发展和财务制度日渐健全，各省区今年实现按月给社员发工资的社、队更多了。生活方面，今年人民公社取得了更加伟大的成就。农村公共食堂、托儿组织、敬老院、卫生医疗等生活福利事业都办得比过去更好更有经验。对五亿农民生活的妥善安排是人民公社最大的优越性之一，也是广大农民最拥护的一条。今年全国农村在公社化的基础上又全面实现了公共食堂化。贵州、河南和各省区对办食堂的工作都已总结出成套的经验。各地食堂普遍开始建立自己的副食品生产家务。由于今年各地对社员生活安排得更好，食堂办得更好，虽然去年和今年夏季各地有一些社、队受旱减产，公社和食堂克服困难，保证了社员的生活。各地还有成批的办得好的红旗食堂改善了社员的生活。
    去年和今年全国各地都有大批农村公社受到自然灾害的严重考验。去年旱灾遍及二十个省区，但是人民公社仍然顽强地保证了农业发展。其中受灾特重减产了的公社，今年也千方百计地保证了社员的生活。全国二万四千个农村公社没有一个经受不住这样的考验，充分表现了它的顽强成长的生命力。今年的自然灾害又是频繁的，华北、西北不少地区7月以前一直缺雨；广东、江苏、山东和东北相当部分地区遭受台风涝灾也比较重。尽管河北、河南、山西、山东和其他有些地区旱得春播和夏播都无法播种，人民公社仍然千方百计地抗旱，基本上完成了春播和夏播。连续两年严重灾害，公社屹立不动，而且保证了广大农民的生活，保证了农村生产的继续进行。这就有力地说明了：人民公社已使我国农民永远摆脱了那种每遭自然灾害必然有成百万、成千万人饥饿、逃荒和死亡的历史命运。人民公社大大减低了自然灾害对农业生产的危害性，大大缩小了损失。最近两月以来，全国农村公社响应党的大办农业、大办粮食的号召，掀起了扩大种植晚秋粮食作物和秋菜，加强秋田管理，力争秋季多收的生产高潮。
    随着公社制度巩固，我国农业机械化的事业加快了。两年来，全国农村使用的拖拉机、排灌动力机械、耕作机械、小型水电站和水力站已有显著增加；去冬以来，二十七个省、市、自治区已经建立了一百一十个农业机械的试点。农业机械化的重点地区黑龙江省，今年的机耕面积已占总耕地面积的20％以上。全国已有三十个县和一些公社，基本上实现了粮食加工、炊事作业的机械化或半机械化，有不少公社的田间作业也基本上实现了半机械化。我国农村人民公社正在党的大力抚育下继续巩固，昂首前进。
