Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: Vice Premier Chen Yi hosted a banquet this evening to bid farewell to Takasaki Tatsunosuke, the former chief delegate of Japan to the Bandung Conference, and his entourage.

Premier Zhou Enlai attended the banquet.

Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the banquet. He said that he and Premier Zhou Enlai met Mr. Takasaki Tatsunosuke and cooperated with him during the Bandung Conference. He expressed great pleasure in meeting him again in Beijing. He also extended a warm welcome to Mr. Takasaki Tatsunosuke for his efforts to improve Sino-Japanese relations.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that millions of people from all walks of life in Japan had carried out more than 20 unified actions to oppose the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and demand Japanese independence, and the Chinese people fully sympathized with and supported this just struggle.

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the Chinese people believe that these actions and demands of the Japanese people to take an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral path are very good. However, the actions of the Japanese government are increasingly following the aggressive policies of the United States, which cannot but make us feel regret and make us worry about the future of the Japanese people and the peace of the Far East and the world.

He then expressed his respect for Mr. Takasaki Tatsunosuke, who at the age of seventy-five, is willing to devote the rest of his life to the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. He said that he believes that this effort is in line with the interests of the Japanese people, as well as the interests of the people of the Far East and the whole world. This is a just wish, a just action, and it will surely be successful.

In his speech, Mr. Takasaki Tatsunosuke expressed his heartfelt thanks to Vice Premier Chen Yi for his warm hospitality and to Premier Zhou Enlai for attending the farewell banquet. He said that the scenes of his time with Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi during the Bandung Conference five years ago are still vivid in his mind.

Takasaki Tatsunosuke said that after accepting Premier Zhou Enlai's gracious invitation to visit Northeast China, two things surprised us very much. First, China has achieved amazing achievements in an extremely short period. Now the output of Fushun Coal Mine is four times higher than it was fifteen years ago, and the output of Anshan Iron and Steel is five times higher than it was then. This is unimaginable to us. What can we rely on to achieve these achievements? It is worth pondering. Second, fifteen years ago, the expressions on the faces of Chinese children were melancholy, but now they have completely changed. I saw the happy smiling faces of children. I believe that children are the best mirror to express people's hearts, reflecting the happy life of the Chinese people.

Takasaki Tatsunosuke emphasized that I deeply feel that the reasons for these achievements and changes in people are: the correct leadership policies of outstanding leaders and the result of the united efforts of the entire Chinese people.

Takasaki Tatsunosuke said that today, Sino-Japanese relations are in an abnormal state, which is a sad fact. However, I guarantee that I will devote the rest of my life to restoring friendly relations between China and Japan.

Also attending the banquet were Guo Moruo, Zhang Xiruo, Cai Tingkai, Luo Guibo, Hu Yuzhi, Chu Tunan, Xu Guangping, Xu Zhizhen, Lian Guan, Tong Xiaopeng, Shen Bochun, Wu Defeng, Xue Muqiao, Ji Chaoding, Shen Zijiu, Yang Hansheng, Wei Zhenwu, Ouyang Yuqian, Wu Maosun, Xie Nanguang, Zhao Anbo, Xie Bingxin, Yong Longgui, Yang Zheng, Ding Tuo, as well as people from all walks of life in the capital.

Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji and his wife, who are in Beijing, were also invited to attend the banquet. (Attached picture)

    陈毅副总理设宴欢送高碕达之助
    周总理出席宴会，陈毅副总理和高碕达之助讲了话
    新华社23日讯　陈毅副总理今晚举行宴会，欢送前出席万隆会议的日本首席代表高碕达之助和他的随行人员。
    周恩来总理出席了宴会。
    陈毅副总理在宴会上讲话。他说，高碕达之助先生是周恩来总理和我本人在万隆会议期间认识的，并且进行了合作。这次又在北京见面感到非常高兴。他还对高碕达之助先生为中日两国关系的改善而努力表示热烈的欢迎。
    陈毅副总理说，日本各阶层数百万人民进行了二十多次的统一行动，为反对日美安全条约和要求日本独立而斗争，中国人民十分同情和支持这个正义斗争。
    陈毅副总理指出，中国人民认为日本人民的这些行动和要求走独立、民主、和平、中立的道路是很好的事。但是，日本政府的行动却愈来愈追随美国的侵略政策，这不得不使我们感到遗憾，使我们不得不为日本人民的前途以及远东和世界和平表示忧虑。
    他接着对七十五岁高龄的高碕达之助先生愿意把他的余生为中日两国邦交的正常化而努力，表示尊敬。他说，我相信这种努力是符合日本人民利益的、也是符合远东和全世界人民的利益的。这是正义的愿望，是正义的行动，是一定会获得成功的。
    高碕达之助先生在讲话中对陈毅副总理的盛情招待和周恩来总理出席这个欢送宴会表示衷心感谢。他说，五年前，我在万隆会议期间同周恩来总理、陈毅副总理相处的情景还历历在目。
    高碕达之助说，这次承周恩来总理的盛情邀请，去东北参观访问后有两件事使我们感到非常惊讶，第一、中国在极其短暂的时期获得惊人的成就。现在抚顺煤矿产量比十五年前提高四倍，鞍钢的产量比当时提高了五倍，这是我们难以想像的。依靠什么才能取得这些成就呢？值得我们深思。第二、十五年前我们看到中国小孩面部的表情是忧郁的，可是现在完全变了，我看到小孩愉快的笑脸。我认为，小孩是表现人民心灵最好的镜子，它反映了中国人民愉快的生活。
    高碕达之助着重地说，我深深感到这些成就的取得和人的变化的原因是：卓越的领导人的正确领导方针，和全中国人民团结一致努力工作的结果。
    高碕达之助说，今天，中日两国关系处在不正常的状态，这是可悲的事实。但是，我保证，我将把我的余生为恢复中日两国友好关系而努力。
    出席宴会的，还有郭沫若、张奚若、蔡廷锴、罗贵波、胡愈之、楚图南、许广平、许之桢、连贯、童小鹏、申伯纯、吴德峰、薛暮桥、冀朝鼎、沈兹九、阳翰笙、魏震五、欧阳予倩、吴茂荪、谢南光、赵安博、谢冰心、勇龙桂、杨正、丁拓，以及首都各方面人士。
