　　Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang Electric Dispatch: Commercial departments in Guizhou Province are vigorously supporting the rural people's communes' processing of agricultural and sideline products with equipment and technology.

　　Since the beginning of autumn, commercial departments have successively transferred tobacco, tea, cotton, hemp, mountain goods, and other agricultural and sideline product processing equipment to the countryside. By the end of September, they had transferred more than 6,000 units (pieces) of machines, including hemp stripping machines, power roller cotton gins, tea kneading machines, and flour mills, helping communes establish many small-scale agricultural and sideline product processing plants, which have already processed more than 30 million jin of finished products.

　　Commercial departments also actively promote advanced processing experiences and impart processing techniques through on-site meetings, mobile performances, and other forms. As early as April, the Provincial Department of Commerce summarized the advanced experience of quick hand grading and bundling of flue-cured tobacco in Meitan County, and concentrated skilled workers to form three groups to go to Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture and Anshun, Bijie and other regions that produce tobacco to give mobile performances. According to incomplete statistics, more than 10,000 skilled workers in quick hand grading and bundling have been trained throughout the province. The whole province has also widely promoted rapid baking methods such as semi-air-drying and semi-baking, and tobacco leaf shuttle line bundling, which greatly accelerated the processing progress of flue-cured tobacco. Commercial departments in tea-producing areas, in conjunction with agricultural departments, have helped communes train a large number of technicians who master tea kneading machines, and promoted more than 1,300 tea kneading machines, so that most of the key tea-producing areas in the province have realized semi-mechanized tea making. After the comprehensive processing plant of the Libo Commune store in Dushan County successfully experimented with the comprehensive utilization of corn by-products during the autumn harvest, it immediately convened an on-site technical instruction meeting with the support of the Commune Party Committee, so that the experience of comprehensive utilization of corn by-products quickly took root and blossomed throughout the commune.

    贵州商业部门支援公社加工农副产品
    新华社贵阳电　贵州省商业部门从设备、技术等方面，大力支援农村人民公社的农副产品加工工作。
    入秋以来，商业部门陆续调运烟、茶、棉、麻、山货等农副产品加工设备下乡，到9月底，已下调剥麻机、动力皮辊轧花机、揉茶机、磨粉机等机器共六千多台（件），帮助公社建立了许多小型农副产品加工厂，已加工出成品三千多万斤。
    商业部门还通过现场会、巡回表演等形式，积极推广先进加工经验，传授加工技术。早在4月份，省商业厅便总结了湄潭县烤烟双手快速分级扎把的先进经验，并集中能手组成三个组，分赴盛产烟叶的黔东南苗族侗族自治州和安顺、毕节等专区巡回表演。据不完全统计，全省已培养出双手快速分级扎把能手一万多人。全省还普遍推广了半晾半烤的快速烘烤法和烟叶梭线绑竿法等，大大加快了烤烟加工进度。产茶区的商业部门，协同农业部门帮助公社培养了大批掌握揉茶机的技术人员，推广揉茶机一千三百多部，使全省重点产茶区多数实现了制茶半机械化。独山县荔波公社商店的综合加工厂，在秋收中综合利用玉米副产物试验成功后，即在公社党委的支持下，召开技术传授现场会，使玉米副产物综合利用的经验，很快在全社开花结果。
