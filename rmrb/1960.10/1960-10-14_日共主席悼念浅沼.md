Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka visited the residence of the late Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma last night to express his condolences to Mrs. Asanuma for Asanuma's assassination, and paid silent tribute before Asanuma's body.

Nosaka told Mrs. Asanuma that the Japanese Communist Party believes that this incident is not only an attack on Asanuma, but also a fascist attack on all democratic forces engaged in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Nosaka stated that Asanuma's funeral should be held as a national funeral to express the anger and grief of all the people.

Nosaka then went to the Socialist Party headquarters to express his condolences.

    日共主席悼念浅沼
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本共产党主席野坂参三昨天晚间前往已故社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎的住宅，为浅沼被刺向浅沼夫人表示慰问，并到浅沼遗体前面默哀。
    野坂对浅沼夫人说，日本共产党认为，这次事件不仅是对浅沼一个人的攻击，而且是对于为反对日美“安全条约”而展开斗争的全体民主力量的法西斯攻击。野坂表示，浅沼的葬礼应该作为全体人民表示愤怒和悲痛的国民葬礼举行。
    野坂随后还到社会党总部，表示悼念。
