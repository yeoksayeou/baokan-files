Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: The Japanese Ikeda government's police agency openly issued a nationwide fascist order on the 19th, attempting to obstruct and interfere with the election activities of progressive forces.

Under the pretext of "cracking down on activities violating election laws," the police agency ordered police across the country to arrest candidates and their supporters who engage in so-called "intolerable" election activities, and to prohibit the hanging and posting of election slogans and advertisements.

The police agency ordered local police authorities to "pay close attention" to election speech meetings, whether jointly held or individually held, and to send plainclothes police to be responsible for "security." The police agency also ordered local police to "strengthen" the "protection work" of important political leaders, in order to monitor the activities of progressive people.

It is reported that progressive political parties and mass organizations in Japan have expressed strong opposition to this new fascist offensive by the Ikeda government before the general election.

    日本反动当局发布法西斯命令
    妄图阻挠进步力量参加竞选
    据新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本池田政府的警察厅在19日公然发出一项全国性的法西斯命令，企图阻挠和干涉进步力量的竞选活动。
    警察厅假借“取缔违反选举法活动”的名义，命令各地警察要逮捕进行所谓“不能容忍”的竞选活动的候选人和支持竞选的人们，并且禁止悬挂和张贴竞选标语、广告。
    警察厅命令各地警察当局“充分注意”不论是联合举行的还是个人举行的竞选演说会，并要他们派便衣警察负责“警备”。警察厅还命令各地警察要“加强”对重要政治领袖的“保护工作”，借以监视进步人士的活动。
    据报道，日本进步政党和群众团体都表示强烈反对池田政府在大选前的这种新的法西斯进攻。
