Xinhua News Agency, October 26th, New York dispatch: The discussion on disarmament at the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee, which began on the 19th, entered its second week yesterday without making any progress.

Due to the fact that Western countries, led by the United States, have no intention of disarming at all and continue to play their usual tricks of delaying and sabotaging negotiations, the Political Committee has only held three and a half days of meetings intermittently since the 20th. Aside from representatives of socialist countries, only representatives from Britain, Italy, and Yugoslavia spoke at these meetings. On the second day after the discussion began, the meeting was forced to adjourn after representatives from Poland and Czechoslovakia spoke because no one else registered to speak.

British Foreign Secretary Ormsby-Gore tried his best in his speech on the 24th to prettify the West's proposal of supervision without disarmament and brazenly rejected the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal. He said that the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw all military bases on foreign territories was unacceptable because it would "completely paralyze" the West's aggressive military blocs. He also attacked the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, saying that this proposal "will certainly not achieve disarmament within forty years."

Ormsby-Gore "welcomed" the Soviet Union's acceptance of the principle of establishing a United Nations police force, but firmly rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to reorganize the United Nations Secretariat. He also promoted that the Soviet Union had "taken a big step forward towards the Western position" on the issue of supervision, and pressed on, saying that this was still "not enough." He said that "promises alone are not enough," and the West "has the right" to "insist on requiring (the Soviet Union) to provide evidence."

In order to continue using the disarmament negotiations as a smokescreen to cover up the West's vigorous expansion of armaments and war preparations, Ormsby-Gore advocated that the Political Committee's "main task is to get the negotiations going again," and to "continue talking where" the Geneva Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference, which was sabotaged by the West in September, "left off."

Yugoslav representative Vidić, in his speech on the 24th, advocated "restarting (disarmament) negotiations under the guidance of the United Nations" controlled by the United States. In order to cover up the fact that the imperialist countries, led by the United States, are pursuing a policy of aggression and war, which has caused tension in the international situation, Vidić shamelessly compared the Warsaw Treaty Organization with the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He insisted that the tension in Europe was created "because the armed forces of the two military alliances are confronting each other there."

Soviet representative Zorin analyzed in detail the position of the Western countries and the proposals they put forward at the meeting on the 25th. He pointed out that the speeches of the Western countries' representatives at the meeting clearly showed that the real basis of the Western countries' proposals is the supervision of armaments, that is, the establishment of a legal international espionage system.

Zorin called on Western countries to seriously negotiate the basic principles of a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament. He warned that if the United States and its allies continue to ignore this appeal, if they continue to use the Political Committee's discussion on disarmament to cover up their arms race and brinkmanship policy, then the Soviet delegation will have no choice but to stop participating in the Political Committee's discussion on disarmament.

### 以美国为首的西方国家根本不想裁减军备  联大政委会讨论裁军毫无进展  佐林揭穿美国继续利用讨论掩盖备战的阴谋

    联大政委会讨论裁军毫无进展
    佐林揭穿美国继续利用讨论掩盖备战的阴谋
    新华社26日讯　纽约消息：19日开始的联合国大会政治委员会关于裁军问题的讨论，昨天在毫无进展的情况下进入第二周。
    由于以美国为首的西方国家根本不想裁军，继续玩弄拖延破坏谈判的惯技，从20日起，政治委员会断断续续的只开了三次半天的会议，在这些会议上除了社会主义国家代表外，只有英国、意大利、南斯拉夫三国代表发言。就在讨论开始后的第二天，会议在波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表发言后就由于无人登记发言而被迫宣告休会。
    英国外交大臣奥姆斯比—戈尔24日在发言中极力粉饰西方只要监督不要裁军的提案，并且悍然拒绝苏联的裁军建议。他说，苏联要求撤销一切在外国领土上的军事基地的建议是不能接受的，因为这会使西方侵略性的军事集团“完全陷于瘫痪”。他还攻击苏联的全面彻底裁军建议，说这个建议“肯定在四十年内不会实现裁军”。
    奥姆斯比—戈尔“欢迎”苏联接受西方提出建立联合国警察部队的原则，但坚决拒绝苏联关于改组联合国秘书处的建议。他还宣传苏联在监督问题上“已经向西方立场前进了很大一步”，并且步步进逼地说，这还是“不够的”。他说什么“仅仅是许诺是不够的”，西方“有权力”“坚持要求（苏联）提出证据”。
    为了继续利用裁军谈判作为掩饰西方大力扩军备战的烟幕，奥姆斯比—戈尔鼓吹政委会的“主要任务在于使谈判再次进行下去”，并且是在9月间被西方破坏的日内瓦十国裁军谈判“停下来的地方谈下去”。
    南斯拉夫代表维迪奇在24日发言中鼓吹在美国控制的“联合国指导下重新开始（裁军）谈判”。维迪奇为了掩盖以美国为首的帝国主义国家推行侵略和战争政策造成国际局势紧张的事实，无耻地把华沙条约组织和北大西洋公约侵略集团相提并论，他硬说欧洲的紧张局势的产生“是由于两个军事联盟的武装部队在那里对峙”。
    苏联代表佐林在25日会议上详细地分析了西方国家的立场和他们提出的提案。他指出，西方国家代表在会议上的发言，十分清楚地表明西方国家提案的真正的基础是对军备的监督，也就是建立合法的国际间谍制度。
    佐林呼吁西方国家认真协商全面彻底裁军条约的基本原则。他警告说，如果美国和它的盟国仍然无视这次呼吁，如果它们继续利用政委会关于裁军问题的讨论来掩盖它们的军备竞赛和战争边缘政策，那么苏联代表团将没有别的选择，只有停止参加政委会对裁军问题的讨论。
