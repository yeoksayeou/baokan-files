Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Electric Dispatch: The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee, centering on running canteens well, comprehensively cares for the lives of workers. The eighty-eight workers' canteens of all units under the company have generally achieved democratic management, planned use of grain, sufficient quantity and good quality of food, diverse varieties, and attention to hygiene, which have been praised by the workers. Other welfare facilities have also been greatly improved. The broad masses of workers are free from worries about their lives and are more energetically engaged in the production increase and thrift competition.

The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee regards running canteens well and comprehensively caring for the lives of workers as an important measure to ensure the completion of production plans. The Party Committee Secretary took the lead and formed a life command, and each factory and branch company also established a life welfare command group to lead this work. At the same time, a group of Party members, League members, and activists were transferred to serve as canteen managers and cooks. Now all canteens have established Party branches or groups. Due to strengthening the political and ideological work of the canteens, many poorly-run canteens have quickly caught up. The first workers' canteen of the Iron Smelting Plant was originally a relatively backward canteen. Since twelve Party members and League members were transferred to serve as managers and cooks, and Party and League branches were established to strengthen leadership, sound financial, custody, health, and learning systems were established. The cooks further established the viewpoint of serving production, and the quality of work was significantly improved. Li Xiaolin, the First Secretary of the Company Party Committee, immediately held an on-site meeting of all canteens in the company to promote their experience. After the meeting, a competition upsurge of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced was set off in various canteens. Canteens compared with canteens, individuals compared with individuals, comparing ideas, drive, food, service, thrift, and hygiene, greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the cooks, and advanced canteens emerged one after another.

While vigorously focusing on canteens, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee also organized the masses to raise pigs, grow vegetables, and carry out non-staple food production with great success. Since the beginning of summer, the company has sown 3,853 mu of autumn vegetables; pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks have also gone from nothing to something, from less to more. At present, there are 1,805 pigs in stock, 1,150 sheep, and 5,025 chickens and ducks, which has created good conditions for further improving the lives of workers.

    太钢党委大抓食堂
    广大职工精力充沛投入增产节约竞赛
    新华社太原电　中共太原钢铁公司委员会以办好食堂为中心，全面关心职工生活。全公司所属各单位的八十八个职工食堂一般都做到了管理民主化，用粮有计划，所做饭菜分量足、质量好、花样多、讲卫生，受到职工赞扬。其它生活福利设施也有很大改进。广大职工生活无牵无挂，精力更加充沛地投入增产节约竞赛。
    太原钢铁公司党委把办好食堂，全面关心职工生活当作保证完成生产计划的一项重要措施，由党委书记挂帅，组成生活指挥部；各厂和分公司也成立了生活福利指挥小组，领导这项工作。同时，还抽调了一批党员、团员和积极分子，担任食堂的管理员和炊事员。现在所有食堂都建立了党的支部或小组。由于加强食堂的政治思想工作，许多办得较差的食堂迅速赶了上来。炼铁厂第一职工食堂原来是一个比较落后的食堂，自从抽调了十二名党、团员担任管理员和炊事员，建立党、团支部，加强了领导以后，健全了财务、保管、卫生、学习等制度，炊事员进一步树立了为生产服务的观点，工作质量显著提高。公司党委第一书记李晓林立即召开全公司食堂现场会议，推广了他们的经验。会后，各个食堂便掀起学先进、赶先进的竞赛热潮。食堂与食堂，个人与个人，互相比思想、比干劲、比饭菜、比服务、比节约、比卫生，大大调动了炊事人员的积极性，先进食堂纷纷出现。
    太原钢铁公司党委在大抓食堂的同时，组织群众养猪、种菜、进行副食品生产也搞得有声有色。入夏以来，全公司播种秋菜三千八百五十三亩；猪、羊、鸡、鸭，也从无到有，从少到多。目前，圈存猪一千八百零五头，养羊一千一百五十只，养鸡鸭五千零二十五只，这对进一步改善职工生活，创造了良好条件。
