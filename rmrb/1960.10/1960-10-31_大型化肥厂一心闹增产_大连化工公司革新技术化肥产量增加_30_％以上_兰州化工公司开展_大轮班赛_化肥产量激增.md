Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, October 30th: To prepare "grain for grain," the Dalian Chemical Industrial Company has increased its output of ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, ammonia water, and other fertilizers by 30% to 100% since September.

This company has consistently sought to increase production through technological revolution. Before August of this year, after 102 reforms in production equipment and operating procedures, the average monthly output of chemical fertilizers increased by more than 80% compared to last year. After September, under the leadership of the Party committee, all employees of the company re-formulated a plan to increase the production of chemical fertilizers, requiring further increases on the original basis. To achieve this goal, the factory summarized more than 600 proven methods of increasing production and comprehensively promoted them in various production units, and checked and revised management regulations and operating methods. As a result, the output of chemical fertilizers quickly increased. The ammonium nitrate workshop could only produce more than 20 tons of ammonia water per day. Now, they have developed a method to increase the production of ammonia water, increasing production capacity by one and a half times. Under the slogan of vigorously increasing ammonia water production to ensure agricultural needs, workshops that did not originally produce ammonia water are now also producing ammonia water. When the synthesis workshop started producing ammonia water, they had no equipment, so the workers devised a way to use two idle liquid ammonia tanks instead, and now they can produce 40 tons of high-efficiency agricultural ammonia water per day.

According to statistics, the company's synthetic ammonia production has increased by more than 30% since September compared to the previous monthly average. Due to the increased production of synthetic ammonia, the output of ammonium sulfate has also increased significantly, increasing by 27% in September compared to August, and the output in the first 18 days of October is almost equal to the entire output of the previous month.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, October 30th: The Lanzhou Chemical Industrial Company organized a "large shift competition" based on production processes, which promoted the production of chemical fertilizers. The company's fertilizer production in August increased by 32% compared to July, and in September it increased by 23% compared to August.

The "large shift competition" involves organizing all production workers in the factory, from the first process to the last, in the same shift (i.e., the large shift) as a unit, and carrying out competitions between shifts based on the production process. This form of competition breaks down the boundaries of workshops, strengthens cooperation and coordination between front and rear processes, and better meets the needs of chemical production.

In the past, the various processes and workshops of the Lanzhou Chemical Industrial Company considered the production tasks of their own units more. The "large shift competition" uses the final production results of this shift to test the quality of the work, so the workers have completely broken the boundaries of their own teams, processes, and workshops in their thinking, and are concerned about the production of the entire factory system. For example, the workers in the water washing section of the compression workshop, as soon as they found that the final product yield was low, immediately contacted the production dispatch very concernedly to inquire whether it was because the quality of the gas they processed was not good and affected the yield. The workers in the conversion workshop changed the past method of operating with a fixed process index and took the initiative to contact the synthesis workshop to adjust the operation according to the requirements of the synthesis workshop.

### 大型化肥厂一心闹增产  大连化工公司革新技术化肥产量增加30％以上  兰州化工公司开展“大轮班赛”化肥产量激增

    大型化肥厂一心闹增产
    大连化工公司革新技术化肥产量增加30％以上
    兰州化工公司开展“大轮班赛”化肥产量激增
    新华社旅大30日电　为粮备“粮”，大连化学工业公司从9月份以来，硫铵、硝铵、氨水等的产量分别比过去增长30％到一倍。
    这个公司一直通过技术革命求得增产。今年8月份以前，经过在生产设备和操作过程方面的一百零二次改革以后，化学肥料每月平均产量比去年增长80％以上。9月份以后，全公司职工在党委领导下又重新制定了增产化学肥料的计划，要求在原来的基础上再增产。为实现这一目标，全厂总结出六百多条过去行之有效的增产经验，在各个生产单位进行了全面推广，并且检查和修订了管理规程和操作方法。这样一来，化学肥料产量很快有了增长。硝铵车间原先一天只能生产二十多吨氨水。现在，他们研究出了增产氨水的办法，生产能力一下子提高了一倍半。在大力增产氨水保证农时需要的口号下，原来不生产氨水的车间现在也都生产氨水。合成车间在开始生产氨水的时候没有设备，工人就想办法用两个闲置不用的液氨罐代替，现在一天也能生产出四十吨高效能的农用氨水。
    据统计，全公司合成氨的产量9月份以来比过去月平均产量增长30％多。由于合成氨的增产，硫铵的产量也显著上升，9月份比8月增长27％，而10月份头十八天的产量几乎等于上个月的全月产量。
    据新华社兰州30日电　兰州化学工业公司按生产工序组织了“大轮班竞赛”，促进了化肥的生产。全公司8月份的化肥产量比7月份增长了32％，9月份又比8月份增长了23％。
      “大轮班竞赛”，就是按生产过程，以全厂从第一道工序到最后一道工序在同班（即大轮班）生产的所有生产工人为单位，开展班与班之间的竞赛。这种竞赛形式打破了车间的界限，加强了前后工序之间的协作配合，更好地适应了化工生产的需要。
    兰州化学工业公司各个工序、车间原来考虑本单位的生产任务比较多。“大轮班竞赛”，由于是以这一个轮班的最后生产成果来检验工作的好坏，因此工人们在思想上完全打破了本班组、本工序、本车间的界限，而关心全厂系统的生产。例如压缩车间的水洗工段的工人，一发现最后产品产量低了，就非常关心地立即与生产调度联系，询问是不是因为他们加工的气体质量不好而影响的。变换车间的工人改变了过去固定一个工艺指标的操作方法，主动与合成车间联系，根据合成车间的要求来调节操作。（附图片）
