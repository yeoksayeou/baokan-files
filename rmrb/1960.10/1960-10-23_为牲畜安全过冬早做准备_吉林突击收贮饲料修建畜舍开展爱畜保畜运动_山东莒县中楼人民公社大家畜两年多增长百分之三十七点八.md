To Prepare Early for Livestock to Safely Overwinter

Jilin Intensifies Feed Storage, Builds Livestock Shelters, and Launches a Livestock Care Movement

Shandong Ju County Zhonglou People's Commune Sees a 37.8% Increase in Large Livestock in Just Over Two Years

(Our newspaper, Changchun, 22nd dispatch) Jilin is deeply engaged in a livestock care, protection, and increase movement centered on intensifying feed storage, gaining autumn膘 (autumn fatness), and building livestock shelters. During the movement, in order to eliminate the phenomenon of weak livestock, various counties in the Yanbian area, after a comprehensive inspection of the膘情 (fatness condition), took advantage of the favorable time of grazing horses and cattle, and universally adopted the method of centralized management of weak livestock by management area. They assigned dedicated personnel to drive the livestock to the mountains, set up camps for grazing, and promoted the rapid gain of膘 (fatness) for livestock. Da'an County adopted methods such as dividing large herds into smaller herds, selecting good grass for grazing, and increasing the time for grazing dew grass by going out early and returning late, which has enabled more than 70-80% of more than 3,500 livestock with third-class膘 (fatness) to reach sufficient膘 (fatness). At present, more than 80% of the livestock in the province have reached more than 70-80% of their膘情 (fatness condition). On this basis, various localities actively adopted the method of combining artificial insemination and natural mating to concentrate on breeding, which increased the number of pregnant female livestock in the province by 5% compared to last year.

In order to prepare livestock for overwintering and spring passage, various localities, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, organized more than 1.8 million people in early September to concentrate on collecting feed. A total of more than 2.2 million tons of green feed have now been stored, more than double the amount in the same period last year.

At the same time, people's communes in various localities have also drawn a group of laborers to build livestock shelters. According to statistics at the end of September, more than 31,000 new livestock sheds and more than 92,000 pig houses have been built in the province. In order to ensure the full survival of newborn livestock in severe winter, many livestock delivery rooms have also been built and expanded in various places. Now many communes and ranches have achieved the requirements of horse sheds and pig houses. Various localities also carried out a comprehensive immunization injection for livestock and poultry. According to statistics from Baicheng, Siping, Tonghua, and Yanbian, more than 900,000 pigs, more than 60,000 horses, and more than 240,000 cattle have been injected with various disease prevention vaccines, and more than 90,000 livestock sheds of various types have been padded and disinfected.

At present, Jilin is further grasping the work of storing feed in conjunction with the autumn harvest, and has implemented the plan for storing agricultural and sideline products to the production teams.

(Our newspaper, Jinan, 22nd dispatch) The number of large livestock in Zhonglou Commune, Ju County, Shandong Province, has increased from 1,651 at the beginning of communization to 2,276, an increase of 37.8% in just over two years.

Every autumn, the Zhonglou Commune mobilizes the masses to collect, dry, and store forage grass in large quantities to ensure that livestock have sufficient forage to overwinter and pass through the spring. At the end of the early autumn harvest this year, the commune launched a concentrated week of collecting wild forage grass. By the end of September, the commune had collected and stored 3.33 million jin of dry wild grass, plus 3.88 million jin of crop stalks such as corn, averaging 3,165 jin per livestock, enough for winter and spring.

The Zhonglou Commune currently has 870 mature female livestock, and 60% of them have been bred and are pregnant. The commune has established an artificial insemination station, and each team has raised breeding livestock. In order to do a good job in breeding, the commune has also established a set of reward and punishment systems. Now, 16% of the female livestock in the commune can breed one young livestock a year, and the rest breed two in three years.

In order to strengthen feeding management, the commune established a livestock management committee to regularly inspect the work. And in the teams to carry out three diligence (diligent inspection, diligent bedding, diligent out of the column), five clean (column clean, trough clean, hay storage room clean, livestock body clean, water clean) evaluation activities. From the commune to the brigade, regular appraisal meetings of cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses are held. This summer, at the commendation meeting, the commune commended and rewarded the Jishangou, Banlou, and Yaobu production teams with fat livestock and rapid development, and selected 84 model breeders.

    为牲畜安全过冬早做准备
    吉林突击收贮饲料修建畜舍开展爱畜保畜运动
    山东莒县中楼人民公社大家畜两年多增长百分之三十七点八
    本报长春22日电　吉林深入开展以突击收贮饲料、抓秋膘、建畜舍为中心的爱畜、保畜、增畜运动。在运动中，延边地区各县为了消灭牲畜瘦弱现象，通过全面的膘情大检查后，乘牧马放牛的有利时机，对瘦弱牲畜普遍采取以管理区为单位集中的方法，确定专人赶畜上山，扎寨放牧，促使牲畜迅速增膘。大安县采取大群化小群、选好草放牧和早出晚归增加放露水草的时间等办法，已使三千五百多匹三类膘的牲畜达到了七、八成膘。目前，全省已有80％多的牲畜达到了七、八成以上的膘情。在这个基础上，各地积极采取了人工授精与自然交配相结合的方法突击配种，使全省怀胎的母畜比去年增加了5％。
    为了做好牲畜过冬渡春的准备工作，各地根据省委的指示，在9月初组织了一百八十多万人，突击采集饲料。现已收贮青饲料共计二百二十多万吨，比去年同期增加一倍多。
    与此同时，各地人民公社又抽出一批劳力修建畜舍，到9月末统计，全省新建畜棚三万一千多间，猪舍九万二千多间；为了保证严冬新生仔畜全生全活，各地还修建和扩建了许多家畜接产室。现在许多公社和牧场都达到了马有棚、猪有舍的要求。各地还给畜禽作了一次全面的防疫注射。据白城、四平、通化、延边四个地区的统计，已有九十多万头猪、六万多匹马、二十四万多头牛注射了各种疫病预防针，并起垫、消毒各种畜舍九万多间。
    目前，吉林各地结合秋收，进一步大抓收贮饲料工作，已将收贮农副产物计划落实到了生产队。
    本报济南22日电　山东莒县中楼公社的大家畜，已从公社化初期的一千六百五十一头，发展到二千二百七十六头，两年多来增长37.8％。
    中楼公社每到秋季，便发动群众大采、大晒、大储饲草，保证牲畜有足够的饲草过冬渡春。今年早秋收获结束时，公社开展了一个采集野生饲草的突击周，到9月底，全社已采集储备干野草三百三十三万斤；加上玉米等作物秸棵三百八十八万斤，平均每头牲口合三千一百六十五斤，足够冬春两季之用。
    中楼公社现有适龄母畜八百七十头，已配种怀胎的占60％。公社建立了人工配种站，队队养了种畜。为了搞好配种工作，公社还建立了一套奖惩制度。现在，全社有16％的母畜达到一年繁殖一头幼畜，其余的三年繁殖两头。
    为加强饲养管理，公社建立了畜牧管理委员会定期检查工作。并在各队开展三勤（勤检查，勤垫栏，勤出栏），五净（栏净，槽净，存草屋净，畜体净，水净）评比运动。从公社到大队定期召开牛、驴、骡、马评比大会。今年夏季，公社在评比大会上，表扬奖励了大家畜膘肥体壮、发展快的鸡山沟、板楼、姚埠三个生产队，并选出八十四名模范饲养员。
