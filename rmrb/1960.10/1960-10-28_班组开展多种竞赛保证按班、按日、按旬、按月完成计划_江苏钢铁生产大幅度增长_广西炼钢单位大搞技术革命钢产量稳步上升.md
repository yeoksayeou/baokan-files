Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing. Over 3,600 class teams on the steel production front in Jiangsu Province are engaging in mutual competition, linking upper and lower levels, and competing for high yield, high quality, low consumption, and safety in the increasing production and practicing economy movement. A favorable situation has emerged with competitions forming a network, model workers becoming a forest, and cooperation becoming a common practice, leading to a thriving production. Since late September, steel production in the province has increased substantially. In mid-October, the average daily steel output increased by 8.6% compared to the first ten days of the month, iron increased by 16.4%, the utilization coefficient of converters in the province increased by 15%, and the production of more than one-third of the blast furnaces caught up with the production level of advanced blast furnaces. The quality of steel and iron has improved accordingly, and iron consumption and coal consumption have also decreased every ten days.

    Comprehensively fulfilling the state plan and comprehensively improving the level of production technology are the central content of the class team competitions on the steel front in the province. All class teams have launched various competitions around the requirements of completing plans on a shift, daily, ten-day, and monthly basis. There are cycle competitions between three shifts, A, B, and C, on one type of work, one furnace, and one work area; there are opponent competitions between class teams of the same type of work in different furnaces and different work areas; there are one-dragon cooperation competitions with small blast furnaces or converters as the center for each class team; and there are also technical demonstration competitions, tackling key problems competitions, and model worker competitions to solve key problems, promote advanced experience, and innovate technology. The steel refining workers on the three-ton converter at Changzhou Steel Plant, under the slogan of "Three shifts for one furnace, every furnace strives for high yield," after the three shifts enthusiastically launched the cycle competition, the previously lagging Feng Mao Da class team, in the competition, humbly learned the spirit of cooperation from the A class team and the operational experience from the B class team, and in a short period of a few days, it jumped to the first place among the three shifts. The A class team led by Chen Wen immediately adopted measures such as fast charging, fast feeding of molten iron, fast removing of materials, and fast tapping of steel, and achieved the competition target of fifteen heats per shift; the B class team led by Wen Yuquan absorbed the advanced experience of the above two shifts and created a plant-wide record of 49.3 tons per shift. Due to the launching of the class team competition, the output of this plant surpassed one shift after another and one furnace was higher than another, entering the ranks of advanced units in the city's steel refining production. In the one-dragon steel grabbing competition with the converter as the center in the steel refining workshop of Suzhou Xujiang Steel Plant, each class team on each process, focusing on extending furnace life and shortening blowing time, cooperated with each other and showed their skills. The iron smelting class team adopted methods of frequent ventilation and careful maintenance of the bridge to ensure the normal production of the iron smelting furnace and timely supply of molten iron for converter steel refining; the furnace repair class team promoted the rapid cross-operation furnace repair method, with several types of work progressing simultaneously, shortening the furnace repair time of the converter and ensuring the normal blowing of the converter; the logistics operation team also actively delivered various raw materials and materials to the front of the furnace in a timely manner; the furnace front blowing class team adjusted the labor organization and improved the operational technology of charging and discharging materials to shorten the blowing time. All the class teams in the entire workshop were of one mind, and all the processes were working together, and the average daily steel output in the first ten days of October increased sharply by 80% compared to the same period last month.

    In the competition, each class team conscientiously implemented various effective measures to ensure high yield, high quality, and low consumption. The class teams of each steel plant carried out technical innovation and technical revolution around the aspects of high wind, high temperature, prolonging the life of the iron smelting furnace, shortening the blowing time of each heat of steel, and ensuring the continuous production of the converter. Many iron smelting and steel refining units have also improved and strengthened the enterprise management of the class teams, implemented the advanced management methods of leading cadres and political work, technical work, material supply, and welfare benefits "five to the front of the furnace" to ensure the high yield of blast furnaces and converters. Now, all steel enterprises have achieved timely statistics, furnace-by-furnace analysis, three grasps in one shift, shift-by-shift comparison, and timely evaluation, so that the new achievements created by one class team quickly become the goal pursued by another class team; the new technologies and new experiences created by one class team immediately become the content learned by another class team.

    In order to strengthen the specific leadership of the class team competition, party committees at all levels have successively dispatched nearly 10,000 cadres to go deep into the front of the furnace and into the class teams to grasp ideology, grasp management, grasp scheduling, and follow the shifts to work. Therefore, many problems have been solved in a timely manner, effectively promoting the sustained development of the class team competition.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning. The staff and workers of more than ten steel refining units, such as Liuzhou Steel Plant in Guangxi, have widely launched class and furnace competitions since October, promoting the steady rise of steel output.

    In the competition, the staff and workers of each unit, aiming at the weak links in their own production, vigorously carried out innovation and solved many key problems. The Party Branch Secretary and Director of the converter steel refining workshop of Liuzhou Steel Plant went deep into the furnace side, led the staff and workers to launch a series of technical demonstration competitions, and summarized a relatively complete set of operating methods, which shortened the blowing time of each heat of steel from 40 minutes to 26 minutes: The furnace life also extended from an average of 18 heats in September to 20 heats in the first ten days of October, with a maximum of 32 heats. In the first half of October, the plant's steel output increased by 18.6% compared to the same period in September. The staff and workers of the electric furnace section of the foundry workshop of Liuzhou Air Compressor Factory strictly controlled the content of elements such as carbon, sulfur, and phosphorus during the smelting time, and continuously blew five heats of high-quality steel in the four days from October 7th to 10th.
