　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th October: Spurred by the call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, more than 4.5 million laborers in Liaoning Province are working tirelessly day and night on the autumn harvest. As of October 8th, the province has harvested over 3 million hectares, accounting for approximately 65% of the various autumn crops. The areas with faster progress, such as Lüda and Chaoyang, have completed the harvesting of all field crops. In the counties under the jurisdiction of Shenyang City, where the season is later, over 80% of the dryland crops have been cut, and some crops have been transported and threshed.
    This year, Liaoning Province's autumn harvest is not only progressing quickly, but the quality of work is also generally better than last year. In accordance with the requirements of careful harvesting and meticulous threshing to ensure that every grain is returned to the granary, all localities are focusing on "cleanliness." In Andong County, the communes have implemented a responsibility system, adopting methods such as pinching sorghum and laying out sacks, pulling crops and laying out mats, and threshing the fields multiple times, to ensure that the crops are harvested quickly and cleanly. Liaozhong County has implemented a system of "four fixeds" (fixed tasks, fixed quality, fixed time, fixed remuneration) and "five follow-ups" (following up with cutting, hauling, picking, threshing, and storing), ensuring that the quality of autumn harvest in each commune generally meets the requirements. In order to thoroughly ensure that every grain is returned to the granary and that no blade of grass is wasted, mass grain-picking campaigns have been widely launched in various localities. According to statistics from more than twenty counties including Chaoyang, Jianping, Xinjin, and Kaiyuan, over 2 million catties of grain have already been picked.
    In conjunction with the large-scale autumn harvest, the "small autumn harvest" campaign is also in full swing in various localities this year. In accordance with the spirit of the provincial Party committee's instructions, many regions have made unified arrangements for the large and small autumn harvests and established professional front lines. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 360,000 people throughout the province engaged in the rush to collect mountain goods and wild fruits, harvest small oilseeds, collect wild fibers, and store feed. More than 70 million catties of various wild plants and more than 1.5 billion catties of silage have been collected.
    The reason why Liaoning Province's autumn harvest is progressing so quickly and well this year is mainly due to the concentrated use of labor. As early as before the start of the autumn harvest, various localities had taken various measures to concentrate more than 80% of the rural labor force on the front lines of autumn harvest production. At the same time, cities and counties have also actively organized people from all walks of life in the cities to vigorously support rural autumn harvest production. According to incomplete statistics, the support force currently fighting on the front lines of the autumn harvest has reached more than 2.5 million people. Among them, Shenyang City alone has organized 1 million people. The joint efforts of urban and rural people have greatly accelerated the progress of the autumn harvest. In order to strengthen the leadership of the autumn harvest work, many counties have transferred a large number of cadres to production teams to concurrently serve as branch secretaries and production team leaders. At the same time, responsible comrades from cities and counties have also personally gone to the front lines to command the battle. After the start of the autumn harvest, Hou Guoying, the first secretary of the Chaoyang Municipal Party Committee, went to the Beisijiazi Commune in Chaoyang County twice. Through laboring together with the commune members, he helped the commune summarize a complete set of advanced experiences from cutting to hauling and from pinching to threshing. After this experience was promoted, it played a significant role in promoting autumn harvest production throughout the city.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, October 8th: Four and a half million rural people's commune members and urban residents in Heilongjiang Province who are participating in the autumn harvest are waving sickles to rush harvest and carefully gather autumn crops, striving to return every grain to the granary. At present, the province has harvested more than 30 million mu of crops such as millet, corn, sorghum, and soybeans.
    This year, Heilongjiang Province has fully implemented the policy of combining multiple planting for multiple harvests and high yields, and has promoted the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, as well as cultivation methods such as reduced ridges and increased rows, mixed planting, intercropping, and relay cropping. This year's autumn harvest requires more labor than in the past. Under these circumstances, in order to achieve timely harvesting, careful and quick harvesting, and complete and clean harvesting, the province's rural people's communes have concentrated more than 80% of the labor force on the front lines of the autumn harvest. In addition, the province has also organized more than 1.2 million people from the cities to go to the countryside to help the people's communes with the autumn harvest. Therefore, the number of people participating in the autumn harvest this year exceeds any previous year, and the autumn harvest has achieved fast progress and good quality from the beginning. The Songhua River area, which accounts for one-third of the province's grain output in previous years, has now harvested more than half of its autumn crops, and has combined cutting, hauling, threshing, and plowing. The hauling, threshing, and autumn plowing have been completed 20% to 25%. The autumn fields in Zhaozhou, Anda, and other counties in this area have been harvested by about 90%. Now they are concentrating superior forces to carry out hauling, threshing, and autumn plowing. Bin County in the Harbin area, each people's commune has adopted the method of arranging labor according to the person and the work, dividing the 100,000 people participating in the autumn harvest into more than 4,000 cutting teams, more than 2,000 hauling teams, more than 1,700 grain-picking teams, and many professional teams for threshing, seed selection, etc., establishing a responsibility system and focusing on key tasks, thereby ensuring the quality of the autumn harvest. The Shuiquan Commune in Shuangcheng County has formulated "Three Major Disciplines and Eight Points of Attention" for the autumn harvest work, and compiled them into an "Autumn Harvest Song" to help commune members remember the matters that should be paid attention to in the autumn harvest, which effectively promoted the improvement of autumn harvest quality. The Renyi Management Area of ​​this commune, due to paying attention to careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, harvested an additional forty catties of grain per hectare.
    During the autumn harvest, leading cadres at all levels throughout the province went deep into the front lines to participate in and lead the autumn harvest. In Hailun County, led by the first secretary of the county Party committee, more than 20,000 cadres were organized to meet in the fields. Cadres in the Juxin Management Area of ​​the Henan People's Commune in Kedong County established "model fields" for autumn harvest to guide the autumn harvest. When cutting millet, branch secretary Zou Hejun first cut a "model field," and then held an on-site meeting in this field, summarizing and promoting the experience of careful harvesting and meticulous threshing through on-site visits, which encouraged the commune members to strive to return every grain to the granary.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, October 8th: Recently, more than 2,000 county, commune, and management area cadres in Shuangyang County, Jilin Province, have gone deep into the fields to focus on the quality of the autumn harvest, making this year's autumn harvest careful, fast, and clean.
    From the first secretary of the county party committee to the management area party branch committee members, as soon as the autumn harvest began, cadres at all levels actively went deep into the masses and into the fields to meticulously check every small link in the autumn harvest work together with the masses, and summarized and promoted various advanced experiences. Shan Yonghe, the first secretary of the county party committee, went to the seventh production team of the Daying Management Area of ​​the Liujia Commune, and together with the commune members, he summarized the experience of harvesting quickly and well. For example, when harvesting millet, the knife should be placed flat, close to the soil, bend down, grab small handfuls, tie lightly and gently, tie small and tight bundles, and do not twist the bundles. When harvesting sorghum, the stalks should be cut, not pulled, and the ears should be placed first, followed by the roots. When harvesting soybeans, grab small handfuls close to the soil. When hauling, the cart should be lined with mats, loaded well and tightly, without overturning, and the stacks should not be too large or too small to prevent mold, etc. These experiences were promptly disseminated to the communes by telephone and radio, which played a great role in guiding the autumn harvest and ensuring quality. Zhu Fengxiang, the first secretary of the Changling Commune Party Committee, found that some production teams needed to build walls around the threshing grounds to prevent poultry and livestock from damaging the grain, but they lacked grass mats, so he tried to use sorghum stalks or dig anti-encroachment ditches instead. Now, the entire commune has established and dug 37 walls and ditches to prevent poultry and livestock from entering the threshing grounds and damaging the grain.
    Cadres at all levels not only carefully grasp every link of the autumn harvest to reduce grain loss, but also pay special attention to arranging and using labor, so as to make the best use of people's talents and achieve high labor efficiency. This year's labor force participating in the autumn harvest was transferred from various fronts, of which half were novices with insufficient harvesting skills. Many commune management areas promptly adopted technical demonstration meetings and methods of experienced farmers leading novices to enable novices to quickly master harvesting techniques. Two hundred and eight novices in the Tuanjie, Aiguo, and Jiusan management areas of the Tuling Commune were led by experienced farmers with higher technical skills. After field demonstrations, teaching, learning, and working at the same time, 164 novices have mastered harvesting techniques. Various communes also launched competitions between work teams to make the autumn harvest fast and good.

    辽宁黑龙江挥镰抢收细收大秋作物
    吉林省双阳县大批干部深入田间总结推广先进经验秋收又细又快又净
  　本报沈阳8日电　辽宁省四百五十多万劳动大军，在大办农业、大办粮食号召鼓舞下，正披星戴月地大闹秋收。截至10月8日统计，全省已经收完三百多万公顷，占各种秋收作物的65％左右。进度较快的旅大、朝阳等地区，大田作物已全部割完；季节较晚的沈阳市所属各县，旱田作物也割倒了80％以上，并且有部分庄稼拉打入仓。
    今年，辽宁省秋收不仅行动快，而且作业质量普遍比去年好。各地根据细收细打、颗粒还家的要求，都大抓“净”字。安东县各公社实行责任制，采取掐高粱铺麻袋、拉庄稼铺席子以及多打一遍场等办法，保证了庄稼收的既快又干净。辽中县实行“四定”（定任务、定质量、定时间、定报酬）、“五随”（随割、随拉、随拣、随打、随入仓）做法，各公社秋收质量普遍合乎要求。为了彻底做到颗粒还家，寸草不丢，各地还广泛开展了群众性的拣粮运动。仅据朝阳、建平、新金、开原等二十多个县统计，现在已经拣粮二百多万斤。
    结合大秋收，今年各地“小秋收”运动也搞得热火朝天。许多地区根据省委指示精神，都把大秋收和小秋收做了统一安排，建立了专业战线。据不完全统计，目前全省各地有三十六万多人突击采集山货野果、收获小油料、采集野生纤维和贮备饲料，现已采集各种野生植物七千多万斤，青贮饲草十五亿多斤。
    辽宁省今年秋收所以做得又快又好，主要是由于劳动力使用集中。早在秋收开始以前，各地就采取各种措施，把农村80％以上的劳动力集中到了秋收生产第一线。与此同时，各市、县还积极组织城市各行各业人民，大力支援农村秋收生产。据不完全统计，现在正奋战在秋收前线的支援大军，已达到二百五十多万人。其中，仅沈阳市就组织了一百万人。城乡人民并肩作战大大加快了秋收进度。为了加强秋收工作的领导，许多县抽调大批干部到生产队兼任支部书记和生产队长，同时，各市、县负责同志也都亲临前线，指挥战斗。中共朝阳市委第一书记侯国英在秋收开始以后，两次到朝阳县北四家子公社，通过和社员一起劳动，帮助这个社总结出了从割到拉，从掐到打一整套的先进经验。这个经验推广以后，对促进全市秋收生产起到了很大作用。
    新华社哈尔滨8日电　黑龙江省四百五十多万参加秋收的农村人民公社社员和城镇人民，正在挥镰抢收、细收大秋作物，力争颗粒归仓。目前全省已收割谷子、玉米、高粱、大豆等作物三千多万亩。
    黑龙江省今年由于全面贯彻了多种多收、高产多收相结合的方针和农业八字宪法，推行了缩垅增行和混种、间种、套种等耕作方法，今年秋收用工量比以往有了增加。在这种情况下，为了作到适时收割，细收快收，收全收净，全省农村人民公社把80％以上的劳动力集中到秋收前线，另外全省还从城市里组织了一百二十多万人下乡帮助人民公社秋收。因此，今年全省参加秋收的人数超过以往任何一年，秋收一开始就作到了进度快，质量好。历年粮食产量占全省三分之一的松花江地区，现在秋收作物已割完一半以上，并且作到了割、拉、打、翻相结合，拉地、脱谷和秋翻地已完成20％到25％。这个地区的肇州、安达等县的秋田已割完90％左右，现在正集中优势力量，进行拉地、脱谷和秋翻地。哈尔滨地区的宾县各人民公社采取因人、因活安排劳力的办法，把参加秋收的十万人，分别组成四千多个割地队、两千多个拉地队、一千七百多个拣粮队，以及很多打场、选种等专业队，建立责任制，分头突击，因而保证了秋收质量。双城县水泉公社订出了秋收工作的“三大纪律八项注意”，并编成“秋收歌”，帮助社员记住了秋收中应该注意的事项，有力地促进了秋收质量的提高。这个公社的仁义管理区，由于注意细收细打，每公顷地多收了四十斤粮食。
    在秋收中，全省各级领导干部深入第一线，参加秋收领导秋收。海伦县以中共县委第一书记为首，组织了两万多名干部会师田间。克东县河南人民公社巨心管理区的干部，建立了秋收“样子田”指导秋收，支部书记邹和君在割谷子时，先割一块“样子田”，随后就在这块地里召开现场会，通过实地参观，总结和推广了细收细打的经验，鼓舞了社员们争取颗粒归仓的干劲。
    新华社长春8日电　吉林省双阳县最近有二千多名县、公社、管理区干部深入田间，狠抓秋收质量，使今年秋收收得又细、又快、又净。
    秋收一开始，双阳县从县委第一书记到管理区党支部委员，各级干部就积极深入群众，深入田间，和群众一起细致地检查秋收工作的每个细小环节，总结和推广各种先进经验。县委第一书记单永和到刘家公社大营管理区第七生产队，同社员们一起总结了收割又快又好的经验。如收割谷子刀放平，贴土皮，弯下腰，抓小把，轻捆轻放，捆小捆紧，穿?不扭?。割高粱要削秆，不要拉秆，先放穗，后放根。割大豆要贴土皮，抓小把。拉地时大车要铺席子，装好捆紧，不翻车，垛不要大，也不要小，防止霉垛等。这些经验都及时用电话和广播向各公社传播，对指导秋收，保证质量起到了很大的推动作用。长岭公社党委第一书记祝凤祥，发现有的生产队场院要打围墙，防止家禽家畜糟损粮食，但缺乏草伐子，就想办法用秫秸或挖防围沟来代替。现在，全公社已建立和挖好三十七处围墙、围沟，防止了家禽、家畜进场糟损粮食。
    各级干部不仅细抓秋收的每个环节，减少粮食损失，同时特别注意安排和使用劳动力，做到人尽其才，劳动效率高。今年参加秋收的劳动力，是从各个战线上调出来的，其中新手占一半，收割技术不够熟练。许多公社管理区就及时采取技术表演会和老手带新手的办法，使新手迅速掌握了收割技术。屠岭公社的团结、爱国、九三等三个管理区的二百零八名新手，都由技术较高的老农带领，经过田间表演，边教、边学、边作，已经有一百六十四名新手掌握了收割技术。各公社还在作业小组之间展开了竞赛，使秋收收得又快又好。（附图片）
