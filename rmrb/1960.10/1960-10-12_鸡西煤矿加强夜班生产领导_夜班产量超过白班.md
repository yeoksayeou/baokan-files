Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 11th - In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the Jixi Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province has earnestly strengthened its leadership over night shift production, practically solving problems in night shift production, thus enabling night shift output to quickly catch up with and surpass day shifts. In early September, the daily output of the Xiaohingshan Coal Mine's day shift was about 1,800 tons, while the night shift could only reach about 1,400 tons. Now, the night shift output has risen to more than 1,800 tons. After the Chengzihe Mine strengthened its night shift work, the night shift output increased by about 30%. In some mines such as Erdaohaozi and Didao, the night shift output of some wells has already exceeded the day shift output.

In strengthening night shift production, each mine is led by a mine-level leader, drawing cadres from functional departments such as equipment maintenance, repair, and material supply, as well as engineering and technical personnel, to form a night-time duty team. They are divided into groups according to their business, contracted to specific areas, and directing production on the shift. After the night shift leadership was strengthened, problems encountered in production can be resolved at any time, thus effectively ensuring high output. For example, a coal mining team in the fourth well of the Xiaohingshan Mine had a problem with the track winch. In the past, it would have to wait until the cadres came to work the next day to deal with it. Now, with the leading cadres on duty at night, a solution was decided on the spot, and normal production had resumed by the time the day shift started the next day. Zhang Minghua, the deputy well leader of the second well of Erdaohaozi, and the section chief grasped the problems of untimely drilling and material delivery on the night shift. During the night shift, they worked with the workers to study solutions, increasing the night shift output from eighty carts to one hundred and twenty carts.

    鸡西煤矿加强夜班生产领导
    夜班产量超过白班
    新华社哈尔滨11日电　黑龙江省鸡西煤矿各矿井在增产节约运动中，认真加强对夜班生产的领导，踏踏实实地解决夜班生产中的问题，使夜班产量迅速赶上和超过了白班。小恒山煤矿9月初每天白班的产量是一千八百吨左右，而夜班只能达到一千四百吨左右，现在夜班产量已经上升到一千八百多吨。成子河矿加强夜班工作以后，夜班产量提高了30％左右。二道河子、滴道等矿有些井的夜班产量已经超过了白班。
    在加强夜班生产中，各矿都由一个矿级领导干部挂帅，抽调设备维护、检修和材料供应等职能部门的干部与工程技术人员，组成夜间值班小组，按业务分片包干，跟班指挥生产。夜班领导加强以后，生产中遇到的问题能够随时得到解决，因此有效地保证了高产。如小恒山矿四井有一个采煤队的道卷出了毛病，如果在过去需要等到第二天干部上班后才能处理，现在有了夜班值班的领导干部，当时就决定处理措施，第二天白班上班时已经恢复正常生产。二道河子二井副井长张明华和段长抓住了夜班打眼和送料不及时的问题，在夜间跟班劳动中和工人一起研究解决方法，使夜班产量由八十车增加到一百二十车。
