Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Dispatch: Sichuan is focusing on late-stage management of double-cropping late rice to promote early maturity and high yields, and to create conditions for early clearing of fields for planting winter crops.

This year, double-cropping late rice in Sichuan has generally grown well due to tight management in the early stages. Currently, the temperature is gradually decreasing, which poses a great threat to the normal growth of double-cropping late rice. Moreover, double-cropping late rice fields are generally used for planting winter crops after harvest. Therefore, how to promote early maturity and high yields of double-cropping late rice has become an important measure. Various regions have universally strengthened ideological education among the masses, summarized the experience of overcoming low temperatures to achieve bumper harvests of late rice in previous years, and greatly encouraged the confidence and drive of the masses and cadres to promote early maturity and high yields of double-cropping late rice. Bolun Commune in Tongliang County adopted the method of field consultations, adapting to local conditions and prescribing the right remedy, and universally introduced and evenly distributed water to sticky soil and fields with many leaks that easily lose water, maintaining ground temperature; for deep-ditch cold-soaked fields, in addition to closing deep water to raise ground temperature, they also heavily applied hot fertilizers. In addition to vigorously applying hot fertilizers such as cow dung and plant ash, Huaiyuan Commune in Gao County adopted the method of burning fire in the fields in the morning, noon, and evening to promote rapid growth of late rice.

In order to strengthen the leadership of late-stage management of double-cropping late rice, many regions dispatched a large number of cadres, led by the secretary, implementing the principles of assigning leaders, assigning labor, assigning fields, and assigning measures, resolutely overcoming low temperatures and not allowing a single plot of late rice to be lost.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Dispatch: Party committees in Hunan Province are deeply mobilizing the masses and strengthening late-stage field management of late rice, striving for full maturity and plump grains, high yields, and more harvests.

Under the guidance of the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward, Hunan Province has increased its double-cropping late rice by four million mu this year compared to last year. At present, most double-cropping late rice is growing well. As of early October, in addition to some that have already turned downwards, most are still heading and flowering, or are in the stage of booting and pregnancy. Therefore, seizing the current favorable opportunity to overcome the grain-filling stage is an important measure to achieve a bumper harvest of late rice and strive for late rice to catch up with and surpass early rice. However, a few cadres and the masses have developed a sense of determinism, believing that there is nothing more to be done. In order to overcome this thinking and strive for high yields and more harvests, from top to bottom, from cadres to the masses, all regions have adopted the method of recalling comparisons and summarizing the experience of bumper harvests in previous years, fully explaining the importance of strengthening late-stage cultivation and management of late rice to cadres and the masses, and put forward the fighting slogan of "Grain not in the barn, management does not stop." Through debate, the Guanwang Commune's Qilin Brigade in Anren County immediately dispatched more than 500 laborers and universally applied a grain-filling fertilizer to all double-cropping late rice fields within three days.

Since the beginning of autumn, most areas of Hunan Province have experienced relatively concentrated and interspersed autumn droughts, so all regions have carried out the struggle to fight drought and protect seedlings. Some places have also mobilized the masses, summarized their experience, and vigorously prevented and controlled rice borers to protect the growth of late rice.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning Dispatch: Grain not in the barn, the harvest is not certain. People's communes in rural Guangxi are focusing on late-stage field management of late rice, striving to harvest more grain per mu.

Late rice seedlings in various parts of Guangxi are generally booting and heading, and the current time is the final decisive moment for striving to increase the yield of late rice more. Therefore, in the spirit of managing to the end and finishing well, all regions are seizing the last opportunity to comprehensively adopt the "three attacks" and "five defenses" measures, namely attacking three types of seedlings, attacking booting fertilizer, attacking grain-filling fertilizer, and preventing drought, preventing cold dew wind, preventing lodging, preventing birds and beasts, and preventing diseases and insect pests. After comprehensively completing booting fertilization of late rice, Daxin People's Commune in Pingnan County once again organized cadres and commune members to identify seedlings in the fields plot by plot. According to the growth of seedlings in various fields, they further adopted new management measures: for seedlings that had just headed, they increased the application of grain-filling fertilizer and assigned special personnel to watch the water, earnestly doing a good job of shallow irrigation and moistening irrigation to prevent lodging; for seedlings that were in the booting and pregnancy stage, they used multiple applications of fertilizer to promote the rapid heading of seedlings.

Encouraged by the excellent situation of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain, members of people's communes in various regions have broken down thoughts such as the "determinism" of late rice and have made the late-stage management work of late rice sound and colorful and practical. Cadres at all levels in the Nanning area led the vast number of commune members to go to the fields to look at the seedlings, lined up plot by plot, and found three types of seedlings. They and the commune members jointly launched a fierce attack. 300,000 people in the entire area were stationed in the fields, and all three types of seedlings had already been applied one to three times, and most of them had risen to the first and second types of seedlings.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou Dispatch: While rushing to harvest single-cropping late rice, all parts of Fujian Province are rationally allocating labor and carrying out late-stage field management of double-cropping late rice and sweet potatoes, focusing on resisting low-temperature attacks, striving for increased production and more harvests.

At present, it is a critical period for double-cropping late rice to fully enter the heading, flowering, grain-filling and grain-setting stages, and for sweet potato tubers to expand and grow. At the same time, it is also the season when natural disasters such as cold waves, wind, drought, and rice stem borers are most likely to occur in Fujian. In order to protect the normal growth of late-maturing crops, since late September, all parts of Fujian Province have, based on weather forecasts, started early to carry out the processing and fertilization work centered on "five preventions" such as preventing cold, preventing wind, preventing drought, preventing diseases and insect pests, and preventing rats and animal disasters. Before the cold wave hit in early October, all communes in mountainous areas such as northern Fujian, eastern Fujian, and western Fujian universally conducted late-maturing crop inspection stations, determining double-cropping late rice that was heading, flowering, and grain-filling, as well as remote mountain fields and cold-water fields, as the focus of the struggle to prevent and resist cold, and at the same time did a good job in preventing and resisting cold for crops such as sweet potatoes and autumn soybeans. Due to the timely implementation of the struggle to prevent and resist cold, various crops can still grow normally after several cold waves.

While carrying out the prevention and resistance of cold, all regions also timely organized forces to prevent other natural disasters according to different situations, ensuring that the fruits of labor about to be obtained are not or are less damaged. Communes in Jinjiang, Nan'an, Hui'an, and other counties threatened by autumn drought used more than 20,000 wind, animal, and human-powered waterwheels to fight the drought, so that late rice and sweet potato fields that were affected by the drought were able to get timely irrigation. Fuan, Minhou, Longxi, and other regions all adopted methods such as applying more phosphorus and potassium fertilizer, appropriately baking the fields, and bundling rice plants to prevent wind and lodging. Communes in Longyan, Nanping, and other regions with more animal pests organized more than 25,000 hunters to exterminate a large number of field mice, and also hunted 122,200 wild animals such as mountain wolves and wild mountain goats, protecting the growth of various crops in mountainous areas.

    四川湖南广西福建万千群众抓紧最后时机夺高产
    晚稻后期田间管理踏实细致
    运用往年经验，巧施肥水，战胜灾害，促使穗穗成熟，粒粒饱满
    据新华社成都电　四川各地狠抓双季晚稻后期管理，力促双季晚稻早熟高产，并为及早腾田播种小春作物创造条件。
    今年，四川各地双季晚稻由于前期管理抓得紧，一般生长良好。目前气温日渐下降，对双季晚稻正常生长是个很大威胁，而且双季晚稻田一般收后要种小春作物。因此，如何促使双季晚稻早熟高产，就成为一项重要的措施。各地普遍加强了群众的思想教育，总结往年战胜低温获得晚稻丰收的经验，大大鼓舞了群众和干部力促双季晚稻早熟高产的信心和干劲。铜梁县波仑公社采取田间会诊、因地因苗制宜、对症下药的办法，对粘质土壤和漏孔较多、容易失水的田，普遍引水匀水，保持地温；对深沟冷浸田，除了关深水提高地温外，还重施热性肥料。高县怀远公社除猛施牛粪、草木灰等热性肥料外，采取早上、中午、夜晚在田间烧火熏烟的办法，促使晚稻迅速生长。
    为了加强双季晚稻后期管理工作的领导，许多地区派出大批干部，由书记挂帅，实行定领导、定劳力、定田块、定措施，坚决战胜低气温，不让一块晚稻受损失。
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省各地党委深入发动群众，加强晚稻后期田间管理，力争穗穗成熟，粒粒饱满，高产多收。
    湖南省在以粮为纲，全面跃进的方针指导下，今年的双季晚稻比去年增加四百万亩，目前大部分双季晚稻生长良好，到10月上旬止，除部分已经钩头散子以外，多数还在抽穗扬花，或正装苞孕穗。因此，抓住当前有利时机，攻好籽粒关，是夺取晚稻丰收，力争晚稻赶早稻超早稻的一项重要措施。但是有少数干部和群众产生了定局论思想，认为再没有什么搞头了。为了克服这种思想，力争高产多收，各地从上到下，从干部到群众，采取回忆对比和总结往年丰产经验，充分向干部群众说明加强晚稻后期培育管理的重要性，提出了“谷不进仓，管理不停”的战斗口号。安仁县关王公社?林大队通过辩论，立即出动了五百多个劳动力，在三天内，对全部双季晚稻田普遍施了一次壮粒肥。
    入秋以来，湖南省大部分地区出现了比较集中和插花性的秋旱，因此各地都进行了抗旱保苗的斗争。有些地方还发动群众，总结经验，大力防治螟虫，保护晚稻生长。
    新华社南宁电　谷不进仓，禾未定局，广西农村人民公社狠抓晚稻后期田间管理，力争每亩收到更多的粮食。
    广西各地晚稻禾苗普遍装胎抽穗，当前正是争取晚稻更多地增产的最后决定性时刻。因此，各地本着管到底和善始善终的精神，抓紧最后时机，全面采取“三攻”和“五防”措施，即攻三类禾、攻禾胎肥、攻穗粒肥和防旱、防寒露风、防倒伏、防鸟兽、防病虫害。平南县大新人民公社在全面完成晚稻攻胎施肥后，再次组织干部、社员到田头逐丘鉴定禾苗，根据各种田的禾苗生长情况，进一步采取了新的管理措施：对刚出穗的禾苗，增施攻粒肥，并且固定专人看水，切实做好浅灌、润灌，以防止倒伏；对正在装胎孕穗的禾苗，用多次施肥的办法，促使禾苗快抽穗。
    各地人民公社社员在大办农业，大办粮食的大好形势鼓舞下，破除晚稻“定局论”等思想，把晚稻后期管理工作作得有声有色，踏踏实实。南宁专区的各级干部带领广大社员下田看禾，逐丘排队，发现三类禾，就和社员一起发动猛攻，全专区有三十万人在田头安营扎寨，全部三类禾已经加施了一次到三次肥料，大部分上升为一、二类禾。
    据新华社福州电　福建省各地在抢收单季晚稻的同时，都合理安排劳动力，开展以抗击低温袭击为中心的双季晚稻和甘薯的后期田间管理工作，力争增产多收。
    目前正是双季晚稻全面进入抽穗扬花、灌浆结籽和甘薯薯块膨大生长的关键时期，同时又是福建寒潮、风、旱和三化螟等自然灾害最易发生的季节。为了保护晚熟作物正常成长，早从9月下旬以来，福建省各地就根据气象预报，及早动手开展以防寒、防风、防旱、防治病虫害和防鼠兽灾害等“五防”为中心的加工加肥工作。闽北、闽东、闽西等山区各公社在10月初旬寒潮来袭前，普遍进行了晚熟作物检查站队，确定正在抽穗扬花和灌浆的双季晚稻和边远山田、冷水田等为防寒抗寒斗争重点，同时作好甘薯、秋大豆等作物的防寒抗寒工作。由于及时开展防寒抗寒斗争，各种作物经过数次寒潮袭击之后仍能正常成长。
    在开展防寒抗寒的同时，各地还根据不同情况，及时组织力量预防其他自然灾害，保证即将到手的劳动果实不受或少受损失。遭受秋旱威胁的晋江、南安、惠安等县的公社，用两万多部风力、畜力、人力水车抗旱，使受旱的晚稻和甘薯田等都得到了适时的灌溉。福安、闽侯、龙溪等专区都采用加施磷钾肥料、适当烤田、捆稻丛等办法，防风防倒伏。兽害较重的龙岩、南平等专区各公社，组织了两万五千多名猎手，扑灭大量田鼠，还猎获山狼、野山羊等各种野兽十二万二千多头，保护了山区各种作物的成长。（附图片）
