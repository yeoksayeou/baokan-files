Donghu Farm's Three-Crop System Area Expanding Year by Year, Last Year Averaging 12,000 Jin of Grain Per Person
All Farm Workers Continue to Expand Autumn Planting Area to Strive for a Summer Harvest Next Year that Exceeds Previous Years
Nanhui County, Shanghai, Fully Promotes Three-Crop System Plan, with an Autumn Planting Area of 27,000 Mu

Hangzhou, 12th (reporter from this newspaper) – Donghu Farm in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, is actively promoting a three-crop-a-year system, continuously expanding the planting area of spring flowering crops (i.e., wheat, barley, and other overwintering crops). Last year, the 107 mu of three-crop land achieved an average yield of 2,017 jin per mu, with each farm worker producing an average of more than 12,000 jin of grain throughout the year, making it one of the units with the highest labor productivity in Zhejiang Province. This year, the three-crop area has increased from 107 mu to 265 mu. With the multiple expansion of the three-crop area, the total output of spring flowering crops this year has increased by two and a half times compared to last year, and the actual harvested amount of summer grains such as spring flowering crops and early rice has increased by 57% compared to last year. The three-crop late rice is currently growing well. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production have further inspired the enthusiasm of the Donghu Farm workers. They are determined to further expand the three-crop area of the entire farm and strive for a summer harvest next year that is better than any other year.

Donghu Farm's trial planting of the three-crop system began in 1956. At that time, the contradiction between the three-crop farming system and the seasons was in front of everyone. Spring flowering crops require 210 days, continuous early rice requires 90 days (in the main field), and continuous late rice requires 95 days (in the main field). Thus, the three crops require a total of 395 days of growing time, but there are only 365 days in a year. What to do? Under the leadership of the Party branch, Communist Party members took the lead in organizing a technical innovation group to conduct breeding experiments on more than ten different varieties of early rice in various different soil types, exploring the growth patterns of early rice. They found that high-yielding early rice varieties such as Luchai No. 1 and Weiguo generally do not begin to joint and head until around June 10th. According to the characteristics of rice, the root system grows vigorously during the growth period before jointing and heading. As long as the seedlings are well-nourished, have sufficient sunlight, and develop well individually, delaying the transplanting time will not have much impact on growth. Therefore, they hypothesized that the missing thirty days could perhaps be solved by advancing the sowing period of early rice. However, this hypothesis was incompatible with the technical specifications that "early rice seedling age should not exceed thirty days." Could this hypothesis be realized? Hu Xiangquan, the deputy farm manager, found in a small early rice seedling field that some border seedlings, which were already fifty days old, grew to a height of one chi seven or eight cun due to sufficient fertilizer and good sunlight, and developed very large plants, but none of them showed the abnormal phenomenon of early jointing and heading. This small piece of border seedlings provided him with a powerful example, encouraging him to challenge the old concepts.

Hu Xiangquan's opinion was supported by the Party branch, and an experimental group was immediately established to carry out two types of experiments to extend the seedling age of early rice: direct sowing and transplanting, and early sowing and sparse sowing. They started raising seedlings as early as April 2nd and transplanted them on May 25th, with a seedling age of up to 53 days. After spending more than 50 days of normal growth in the main field, they bore fruitful results. In this way, they gained time.

The contradiction of time was resolved. However, at that time, some people doubted whether the late planting of continuous early rice in wheat fields could achieve early maturity and high yields. Practice has proved that the late planting of continuous early rice in wheat fields can also achieve early maturity and high yields. In the past two years, the maturity period of continuous early rice in wheat fields at Donghu Farm has been one or two days earlier than that of early rice in green manure fields, and the yield per mu has been above 800 jin. Furthermore, they created the miracle of late rice in wheat fields exceeding early rice in yield every year.

The late planting season of early rice in wheat fields and the particularly short growth period of rice seedlings in the main field are unfavorable aspects; however, under certain conditions, they can also be transformed into favorable factors. The key lies in human effort. By changing the seedling raising techniques and implementing early sowing and sparse sowing, the seedlings have good nutrition and sunlight conditions in the seedling fields. As long as they are carefully cultivated in the main field, they will have more effective tillering, even heading, consistent maturity, large ears, and many grains, thus achieving high yields. In 1958, the second team had a three-crop experimental field that was previously planted with potatoes. The maturity period of potatoes is later than that of wheat, and early rice seedlings were not transplanted until May 28th. However, because they carried out a series of technical innovations based on the growth characteristics of rice, the yield of this early rice field reached 1,222 jin per mu, creating a new record for high yield of early rice in the entire farm. The main technical measures they took were: In terms of transplanting, they boldly negated the old rule of "tender leaves entering the field" and created a set of experiences for skillfully applying starting fertilizer, achieving "every seedling entering the field with new roots, tender roots but not tender leaves, light green color, and sword leaves upright." In terms of field management, they adopted a series of new measures such as applying sufficient quick-acting harrowing fertilizer and "applying good returning green fertilizer every other day, and plowing twice within seven days" to promote early seedling growth, so that the early rice in this experimental field reached the high standard requirements of management of "not losing momentum after planting, rooting new roots every other day, growing tender leaves in three days, and breaking the balance (closing the rows) in twenty days."

Correctly resolving the contradiction of labor force is the key to ensuring the rapid development of the three-crop system. Donghu Farm has a lot of land and a small labor force, with one laborer burdened with the task of cultivating 12.5 mu of land. In order to solve the problem of insufficient labor force after expanding the three-crop area, the Party branch mobilized the masses to work hard from two aspects: rational allocation of crop varieties and tool innovation.

Rational allocation of crop varieties to stagger the harvesting and planting time is an effective measure to rationally arrange the labor force. Because they rationally allocated the three-crop varieties according to the farm's situation, the harvesting and planting work of the more than 260 mu of spring flowering crop fields this year was divided into three sections, closely linked together. The entire farm completed the harvesting and planting tasks of the spring flowering crop fields on May 28th, and completed the first plowing two days ahead of last year. In terms of variety allocation, they adopted the principle of attaching equal importance to early-maturing varieties and medium- and late-maturing varieties. In the allocation of early rice and spring flowering crops before and after, they adopted the principle of matching early with early, medium with medium, and late with late. For the late rice varieties of the three-crop system, they boldly negated the old habit of "mainly using late-maturing varieties" and adopted the practice of "mainly using early-maturing varieties, with appropriate allocation of late-maturing varieties." In the allocation of late rice and early rice before and after, they adopted the principle of matching early with early, medium with medium, and late with late. All three crops used excellent varieties. At the same time, they innovated harvesting and planting tools in sets to improve labor efficiency. This greatly alleviated the contradiction between labor force and seasons, ensuring the rapid expansion of the three-crop area.

In recent years, the achievements of Donghu Farm in promoting the three-crop system have been very significant. Grain production has been the first in the county for many years. So, is it because the natural conditions of this farm are particularly good? No. The more than 500 mu of contiguous paddy fields here were originally bluish-purple soil with very heavy clay, and the groundwater level was high, making it unsuitable for planting spring flowering crops. However, they had a revolutionary ambition to change the unfavorable natural conditions and make the land yield more grain. They braved the severe cold and cut ice to open roads. On this piece of land that had accumulated water all year round, they dug four drainage, irrigation, and fertilizer transportation canals that were more than four chi deep and eight li long, lowering the groundwater level by one meter. After the water conservancy conditions were fundamentally improved, they launched a heat wave of improving the land, fertilizing the lean soil, and adding sand to the clay soil, turning the soil from bluish-purple to black, and from sticky and tough to loose. It has become a good field for expanding the planting of spring grains. With the multiple expansion of the three-crop area, the demand for fertilizer has become even greater. What to do? "Get fertilizer from pigs!" "Get fertilizer from water!" They raised more than 100 mu of revolutionary grass in the big river; at the same time, they vigorously established field livestock farms. Now there are more than 80 field pigsties, providing tens of thousands of dan of high-quality farmyard manure for grain fields every year; they also learned the advanced experience of intercropping beans and wheat from Guali Commune in Xiaoshan, using bean stalks as fertilizer, and promoted the experience of raising fish in rice fields to enhance the fertility of paddy fields. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the Donghu Farm workers have changed the unfavorable natural conditions in this way, creating superior conditions for high-yield and bumper harvests of crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th – The Hongxing Second Production Team of Yancang Commune in Nanhui County, Shanghai, has changed from planting two crops of grain a year to planting three crops a year (barley plus double-cropping rice). The three-crop land has continuously achieved high yields of more than 1,000 jin of grain per mu for three consecutive years. Nanhui County is located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, with an average frost-free period of about 220 days throughout the year. The safe growth period of double-cropping rice requires about 210 days. The Hongxing Second Production Team fully utilized the natural conditions, competed for time, seized the advantage of the land, and boldly experimented with the successful cultivation of three crops a year, creating an important experience for increasing production in areas with a not very long frost-free period. This experience is being promoted throughout the county. In this year's autumn planting, the area of three-crop land implemented in the county has reached 27,000 mu.

The Hongxing Second Production Team began trial planting of three-crop land in 1956. The first year, the 5.8 mu of three-crop land in this team averaged 1,167.5 jin per mu, exceeding the average annual grain output of the entire team by 40.4%. Later, the area of three-crop land in the team gradually expanded to 30 mu, and also achieved high yields every year. In 1958 and 1959, the yield per mu of three-crop land both exceeded 1,000 jin.

Tightly grasping the season and striving for timely planting is an important key to the high yield of three-crop land in the Hongxing Second Production Team. Their practice has proved that the seasonality of planting three crops a year is stronger. If one crop misses the time, late planting and late harvesting will affect the yield of the remaining two crops.

In order to ensure that planting is not delayed, the Hongxing Second Production Team properly arranges the labor force and selects excellent varieties suitable for planting in three-crop land. Before planting and harvesting on three-crop land every year, this team makes careful arrangements for the labor force, and organizes shock work at the time, harvesting, plowing, and planting as they go. They also selected Liangzhong Yuannai "Six Pillars" and "Awnless Single-Grain Indica" rice with short growth periods.

Increasing fertilizer application, rational fertilization, and strengthening field management are another important experience for the Hongxing Second Production Team to cultivate three-crop land well. (Picture attached)

    争天时　夺地利　实行一年三熟制
    东湖农场三熟制面积逐年扩大去年平均每人产粮一万二千斤
    全场职工继续扩大秋种面积争取明年夏季收成超往年
    上海市南汇县全面推行三熟制计划秋种面积二万七千亩
    本报杭州12日电　浙江省绍兴县东湖农场积极推行一年三熟制，不断扩大春花（即小麦元麦等越冬作物）种植面积。去年，全场一百零七亩三熟制田，平均亩产达二千零十七斤，每个农场工人全年平均生产粮食一万二千多斤，成为浙江省劳动生产率最高单位之一。今年三熟制面积又从一百零七亩增加到二百六十五亩。随着三熟制面积的成倍扩大，今年，全场春花总产量比去年猛增两倍半，春花、早稻等夏粮实收量比去年增加了57％。现在三熟制晚稻生长良好。党中央和毛主席关于大办农业、大办粮食的号召，进一步鼓舞了东湖农场职工的干劲，他们决心进一步把全场三熟制面积再扩大，争取明年有一个比任何一年都好的夏收。
    东湖农场试种三熟制，是从1956年开始的。当时摆在大家面前的是三熟耕作制和季节的矛盾。春花作物需要二百一十天，连作早稻需要九十天（本田），连作晚稻需要九十五天（本田）。这样，三熟一共需要三百九十五天的生育期，但是一年总共才有三百六十五天，怎么办？在党支部领导下，共产党员带头组织了技术革新小组，在各种不同土壤的早稻田里，对十多种不同品种的早稻进行培育试验，探求早稻的生长规律。他们发现陆财号、卫国等早稻高产品种，一般都要到6月10日左右才开始拔节孕穗。根据水稻的特性，在拔节孕穗前的生长期间，根系生长旺盛，只要秧苗营养好，光照充足，个体发育良好，推迟移植时间对生长不会有多大影响。于是，他们设想：这不足的三十天时间，也许可以从提早早稻播种期的办法来解决。但是，这个设想是和“早稻秧龄不能超过三十天”的技术规格格格不入的。能不能实现这个设想呢？副场长胡香泉在一小块早稻秧田里发现，一些已有五十天秧龄的边秧，由于肥分充足，光照好，长得有一尺七、八寸高，发了很大的棵，然而却没有一株发生提早拔节孕穗的反常现象。这一小块边秧，为他提供了有力的例证，鼓足了他向旧观念挑战的勇气。
    胡香泉的意见，得到党支部的支持，并且立即建立试验小组，着手进行直播移苗和早播、稀播等两种延长早稻秧龄期的试验。他们早在4月2日就开始育秧，到5月25日插秧，秧龄长达五十三天，在本田里正常地度过了五十多天生长期以后，结下了丰硕的果实。这样，他们就赢得了时间。
    时间的矛盾解决了。但是对小麦田的连作早稻迟种能否早熟高产，当时曾有人怀疑。实践结果证明，麦田的连作早稻迟种也能够早熟高产。两年来，东湖农场小麦田的连作早稻，成熟期都比绿肥田早稻早一、二天，单产都在八百斤以上，并且创造了小麦田连作晚稻年年超早稻的奇迹。
    小麦田的早稻插秧季节晚，稻秧在本田的生育期特别短，这是它不利的一面；但在一定的条件下，它也会转化为有利的因素，关键在于人的努力。在改变育秧技术，实行早播稀播的情况下，由于秧苗在秧田中营养和光照条件都好，在本田中只要精细培育，有效分蘖更多，抽穗齐整，成熟一致，穗大粒多，因而能够高产多收。1958年，第二队有一丘三熟制试验田，前作是马铃薯，马铃薯的成熟期比小麦还迟，到5月28日才插早稻秧。但是，由于他们根据水稻的生长特性，进行了一系列的技术革新；结果这丘早稻亩产一千二百二十二斤，创造了全场早稻高产新纪录。他们采取的主要技术措施是：在移栽方面，大胆地否定了“嫩叶下田”的旧规矩，创造了一套巧施起身肥的经验，做到“株株秧苗带新根下田，嫩根不嫩叶，颜色淡绿，剑叶笔笃”。在田间管理方面，他们采取施足速效性耙面肥和“隔天施好返青肥，七天之内耘两耘”等一系列新措施，促进秧苗早发，使这丘试验田的早稻达到了“种下不落劲，隔天扎新根，三天长嫩叶，二十天破平衡（封行）”的管理高标准要求。
    正确解决劳动力的矛盾，是保证三熟制迅速发展的关键。东湖农场土地多，劳力少，一个劳动力要负担十二亩半田的耕作任务。党支部为了解决扩大三熟制面积以后的劳力不足问题，发动群众，从合理搭配作物品种和工具革新两个方面努力。
    合理搭配作物品种，使收种时间错开，是合理安排劳力的一个有效措施。由于他们根据本场情况对三熟品种都进行了合理搭配，今年二百六十多亩春花田的收、种工作，分成三段，紧相衔接。全场在5月28日全部完成了春花田的收、种任务，而且比去年提前两天全面完成了第一遍耘田。品种搭配方面他们采取了早熟品种和中熟、迟熟品种并重的原则。在早稻和春花前后作的搭配上，采取了早配早、中配中、迟配迟原则。三熟制的晚稻品种，他们大胆地否定了“以迟熟品种为主”的老习惯，而采取“以早熟品种为主，适当搭配迟熟品种”的做法。在晚稻和早稻前后作搭配上，采取了早配早、中配中、迟配迟的原则。三熟全部采用优良品种。同时他们又成套地革新了收、种工具，提高了劳动效率。这样就大大缓和了劳力和季节的矛盾，保证了三熟制面积的迅速扩大。
    几年来，东湖农场推行三熟制的成绩是十分显著的。粮食生产连年都是全县第一。那么，是不是因为这个场的自然条件特别好呢？不是的。这里五百多亩连片的水田，原来都是粘性很重的青紫土，地下水位高，并不适于种春花。但是，他们有一颗革命的雄心，立志改变不利的自然条件，要土地献出更多的粮食来。他们冒着严寒，劈冰开道。在这一片终年积水的土地上，挖开了四条四尺多深、全长八华里的排水、灌水、运肥三用渠道，把地下水位降低了一米。在水利条件得到根本改观以后，他们又掀起了改良土地的热潮，为瘦土加肥，为粘土加沙，使土质由青紫变成乌黑，由粘韧变为疏松。成为扩种春粮的好田畈。随着三熟制面积的成倍扩大，肥料的需要量更大了。怎么办？“向猪要肥！”“向水要肥！”他们在大江里养活了一百多亩革命草；同时，大办田头畜牧场，现在已有八十多间田头猪舍，每年为粮田提供十几万担优质厩肥；他们还到萧山瓜沥公社学来了豆麦间作的先进经验，利用豆秆当肥料，推广了稻田养鱼以增强水田肥分的经验。东湖农场的职工在党支部的领导下，就是这样改变了不利的自然条件，为作物的高产丰收创造了优越的条件。
    本报上海12日电　上海市南汇县盐仓公社红星第二生产队改一年种两熟粮食作物为一年种三熟（元麦加双季稻），三熟田连续三年获得亩产千斤以上粮食的高产量。南汇县地处长江下游，全年无霜期平均约二百二十天，双季稻安全生长期需要二百一十天左右，红星第二生产队充分利用自然条件，争天时，夺地利，大胆试验一年三熟获得成功，为无霜期不很长的地区创造了一项重要的增产经验。这一经验正在全县推广，在今年秋种中，全县三熟田面积，落实的已达二万七千亩。
    红星第二生产队试种三熟田是1956年开始的。这个队第一年试种的五点八亩三熟田平均亩产一千一百六十七斤半，超过全队粮食平均年产量40.4％。以后，全队三熟田面积逐年扩大到三十亩，也年年获得高产。1958年和1959年三熟田亩产都超过千斤。
    紧紧抓住季节，争取适时种植，是红星第二生产队三熟田高产的重要关键。他们的实践证明，一年种三熟，季节性更强，如果有一熟失时，迟种晚收，就会影响其余两熟的产量。
    为了保证种植不误农时，红星第二生产队，妥善安排劳动力，选用适宜三熟田种植的优良品种。这个队每年在三熟田种、收前，就把劳动力作出周密部署，到时候组织突击，随收、随耕、随种。他们还选用了生长期短的良种元麦“六柱头”和“无芒一粒籼”水稻。
    增施肥料、合理施肥，加强田间管理，是红星第二生产队种好三熟田的另一个重要经验。（附图片）
