Master Weather Conditions to Harvest and Store Sweet Potatoes Well
Yu Yousen

Sweet potato is one of the important grains for people in vast areas of our country, and it is also an important industrial raw material and pig feed.

Harvesting and storing sweet potatoes well is an extremely important part of production. Timely harvesting is not only the key to obtaining a good harvest, but also the prerequisite for ensuring the safe storage of sweet potatoes. To achieve timely harvesting, we must first pay attention to mastering the appropriate weather conditions for harvesting. According to the experience of farmers in Shandong, Hebei, Henan and other places, it is generally advisable to harvest around "Frost's Descent," that is, when the daily average temperature is between 12 and 15 degrees Celsius; if the daily average temperature is lower than 10 to 12 degrees Celsius, and the minimum temperature is lower than 3 to 5 degrees Celsius, it will suffer from frost damage.

If sweet potatoes are not properly managed during storage, they are prone to rot. The rotting of sweet potatoes is closely related to the temperature and humidity of the potato cellar. Experienced farmers say that sweet potato storage has four fears: fear of cold, fear of heat, fear of humidity, and fear of dryness, which is very reasonable.

If the temperature inside the cellar is too low, the sweet potatoes are easily frozen. Frozen sweet potatoes are most susceptible to rot. According to observations in Shandong, Hebei and other places, the sweet potatoes begin to freeze when the cellar temperature is lower than 9 degrees Celsius, and severe frost damage and even rot can occur when it is lower than 4 to 5 degrees Celsius. If the cellar is too stuffy (the temperature is generally higher than 18 degrees Celsius) and the ventilation is poor, it is easy to cause sweet potatoes to germinate and rot due to disease. If the humidity is too high (relative humidity is greater than 95%), it is easy to cause moisture damage, which can also cause a large amount of rot.

The main diseases during storage are black spot disease and soft rot. When the humidity is too high, the temperature is too high, and the ventilation is poor, the bacteria brought into the potato cellar can multiply and spread in large quantities, and infect wounded and frozen potato tubers to cause harm. In order to prevent the occurrence of diseases, strict selection should be carried out before entering the cellar to prevent diseased and broken potatoes from being brought into the cellar.

Three Keys to Safe Sweet Potato Storage

Good storage management is the fundamental measure to ensure that sweet potatoes do not rot. Storage management is also a meticulous and complex task, and there should be dedicated personnel responsible for it, with each cellar assigned to a specific person, and necessary storage management systems should be established. According to the characteristics of sweet potato storage, ensure the safe passage through the following three keys.

    I. Cooling Down After Entering the Cellar: In the 20 to 30 days after entering the cellar, due to the warmer weather and higher temperature, the respiration of the potato tubers is vigorous, and there is generally a period of high temperature and high humidity. If the ventilation is poor, it is easy to cause sweet potatoes to germinate or rot due to disease. Therefore, during this period, it is necessary to do a good job in ventilation and exhaust, and dissipate heat and reduce humidity. Open the cellar entrance and enlarge the air vents (but pay attention to sealing the entrance when cold air arrives, and cover the cellar entrance to prevent rain when it rains). When the humidity is too high, you can put some dry grass to reduce the air humidity in the cellar, and observe and check frequently. After the cellar temperature gradually stabilizes, grasp the opening and closing time of the cellar according to the weather changes. Before the "Heavy Snow" season, before the severe cold comes, all the cellar entrances and air vents should be sealed.

    II. Winter Insulation: This key is generally from after "Minor Snow" and "Major Snow" to before "Beginning of Spring." This stage is in the severe winter, and the temperature is very low. If the management is not good, it is easy to cause frost damage. Therefore, the focus of management is to prevent cold and keep warm, and maintain a suitable temperature in the cellar (the safe storage temperature is 11 to 15 degrees Celsius). During this stage, soil should be piled on the top of the cellar, grass curtains should be covered on the potato pile, and windbreaks should be built on the north side of the potato cellar. At the same time, we must pay close attention to cold waves, low temperatures, strong winds and snowfall, and strengthen prevention according to weather forecasts.

    III. Warming Up After "Beginning of Spring": After "Beginning of Spring," the weather gradually warms up, the temperature in the cellar gradually rises, and the vitality of the potato tubers gradually increases. According to experience, after a winter of storage, potato tubers are most prone to rot at this time, so it is necessary to strictly control the temperature and humidity indicators, and carry out appropriate ventilation to prevent the sudden intrusion of cold air and the sharp increase in temperature. During this period, it is also necessary to observe and check frequently, and carry out necessary cellar turning. When frozen and diseased rotten potato tubers are found, they should be selected and disposed of in time.

Do a Good Job in Meteorological Services

Timely harvesting of sweet potatoes and good storage work are very closely related to the weather. In terms of meteorological services, the following basic links must be grasped: 1. Forecast of sweet potato harvest period and harvest conditions; 2. Forecast and prevention of frost; 3. Key weather forecasts during storage; 4. Meteorological observation and inspection services of potato cellars.

The forecast of the sweet potato harvest period and harvest conditions is the basic basis for timely harvesting. Meteorological service stations, outposts, and groups should, on the basis of investigating mass experience, make forecasts of suitable harvest periods and harvest conditions based on medium- and long-term weather forecasts and frost forecasts, combined with suitable temperature indicators for sweet potato harvesting and actual observations, and provide them to the production department for reference during harvesting.

Meteorological observation and inspection of potato cellars is the premise for good storage management. Only by grasping the temperature and humidity conditions in the cellar and the changes in the potato tubers can scientific and reasonable storage management be carried out based on the evidence. Meteorological observation of potato cellars mainly includes temperature and humidity observation, and inspection of potato cellars mainly includes checking whether the potato tubers in the cellar are diseased, frozen, and rotten. The number and time of observation and inspection: the number of times should be more frequent in the initial stage, generally two to three times a day, which is suitable for morning, noon, and evening. In the cold winter, the number of cellar observations should be reduced as much as possible. Cellar appearance observation can be carried out every three to five days, choosing a sunny and windless noon to understand the temperature and humidity changes in the cellar; if abnormal temperature and humidity are found in the cellar, observe the cellar again. The cellar observation should be carried out at a relatively warm and windless sunny noon, and the cellar entrance should be blocked immediately after the observation is completed. In the later stage, it is not only necessary to frequently observe the temperature and humidity in the cellar, but also to frequently go down to the cellar to check the actual situation of the potato tubers.

This year, some areas have suffered severe droughts, and sweet potatoes were cultivated later; some areas may have earlier first frosts. Therefore, according to weather changes, timely harvesting and good storage work are even more important.

    掌握气象情况收好贮好甘薯
    余优森
    甘薯是我国广大地区人民重要粮食之一，同时也是重要的工业原料和养猪饲料。
    收好、藏好甘薯是生产上一个极其重要的环节。适时收获，不仅是获得丰收的关键，而且也是保证甘薯安全贮藏的前提。要做到适时收获，首先必须注意掌握适宜收获的气象条件。根据山东、河北、河南等地农民的经验，一般以在“霜降”前后，即日平均气温在摄氏十二到十五度时收获为宜；如果在日平均气温低于摄氏十到十二度，最低气温低于摄氏三到五度时收获，就要遭受冻害。
    甘薯在贮藏过程中，如果管理不当，容易发生腐烂。甘薯的腐烂与薯窖的温、湿度有着密切的关系。有经验的农民说甘薯贮藏有四怕：怕冷、怕热、怕湿、怕干，是很有道理的。
    窖内温度过低，甘薯易受冻。受冻的甘薯最易腐烂。根据山东、河北等地观测结果，窖温如低于摄氏九度，即开始受冻，低于摄氏四到五度时，即可发生严重的冻害以致腐烂。如果窖内过于闷热（温度一般高于摄氏十八度），通风不良，则容易引起甘薯发芽和发病腐烂。如果湿度过大（相对湿度大于95％），容易引起湿害，也能造成大量的腐烂。
    贮藏过程中主要的病害是黑斑病和软腐病。当湿度过大、温度过高、通风不良的时候，带入薯窖的病菌就得以大量的繁殖与蔓延，并侵染到有伤口和受冻的薯块上为害。为了防止病害的发生，入窖前应进行严格的挑选，防止把病薯和有破伤的薯带入窖内。
    安全保管甘薯的三关
    贮藏管理得好，是保证甘薯不腐烂的根本措施。贮藏管理又是一项细致而复杂的工作，应该有专人负责，分窖包干，建立必要的贮藏管理制度，并根据甘薯贮藏的特性，保证安全地闯过以下三关。
    一、入窖散热关：在入窖后的二十到三十天，由于天气较暖，温度较高，薯块呼吸作用旺盛，一般都有一个高温、高湿时期，如通风不良，就容易引起甘薯发芽或发病腐烂。因此，在这个时期必须作好通风换气和散热降湿工作，将窖口敞开，放大气眼（但在冷空气到来时，要注意封口，遇有降雨时要盖好窖口防止雨淋）。湿度过大时可放一些干草，降低窖内空气湿度，并勤观测、勤检查。当窖温逐渐平稳下来以后，要根据天气变化的情况掌握开窖和闭窖的时间。到“大雪”前后，严寒来临以前，应将窖口和气眼全部都封好。
    二、越冬保温关：这一关一般是在“小雪”“大雪”以后至“立春”以前。这个阶段正处在严寒的冬季，温度很低，若管理不善，很容易引起冻害。因此，管理的中心是防寒保温，保持窖内适宜的温度（安全贮藏的窖温为摄氏十一到十五度）。这个阶段，应在窖顶上培土，在薯堆上覆盖草帘子，在薯窖北面搭防风障。同时必须密切注意寒潮、低温、大风和降雪等天气，根据天气预报加强预防。
    三、“立春”回暖关：“立春”以后，天气逐渐转暖，窖内温度逐渐回升，薯块的生活力渐渐增强。根据经验，薯块经过一冬的贮藏后，这时最易发生腐烂，因此必须严格的掌握好温、湿度指标，进行适当的通风换气，防止冷空气的突然侵入和温度剧增。在这个时期还要勤观测、勤检查和进行必要的翻窖。当发现有受冻和发病腐烂薯块时，应及时挑选出来予以处理。
    做好气象服务工作
    适时收获甘薯并作好贮藏工作，和气象的关系非常密切。在气象服务方面，必须抓住以下几个基本环节：1、甘薯收获期和收获条件的预报；2、霜冻的预报和预防；3、贮藏期间关键性的天气预报；4、薯窖的气象观测和检查服务。
    甘薯收获期和收获条件的预报，是适时收获的基本依据。气象服务站、哨、组应该在调查群众经验的基础上，根据中长期天气预报和霜冻预报，结合甘薯收获适宜的温度指标和实况观测，作出适宜的收获期和收获条件预报，提供生产部门在收获时参考。
    薯窖的气象观测和检查，是做好贮藏管理的前提，只有掌握了窖内的温湿度条件和薯块的变化情况，才能有依据地进行科学合理的贮藏管理。薯窖的气象观测主要是温度和湿度的观测，薯窖的检查主要是检查窖内薯块有无发病、受冻和腐烂等情况。观测、检查的次数和时间：在初期次数应该多一些，一般每天二到三次，分别在早、中、晚上进行为适宜。在寒冷的冬季，应尽量减少下窖观测，可每隔三至五天，选择晴朗无风的中午进行窖外观测，以了解窖内温湿度变化情况；如发现窖内温湿度不正常时，再下窖观测。下窖观测应选择在较暖和的无风晴朗的中午，观测完后应立即把窖口堵好。到了后期，不仅要勤观测窖内的温、湿度，而且还要勤下窖检查薯块的实况。
    今年部分地区因干旱严重，甘薯栽培得较晚；有些地区初霜将有提早出现的可能。因此，根据天气变化，适时收获并作好贮藏工作，就显得更为重要了。
