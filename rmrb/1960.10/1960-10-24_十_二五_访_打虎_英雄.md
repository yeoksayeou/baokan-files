    On the guestbook of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Hall of the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, there is an inscription from Cuban friends standing on the front line of the struggle against U.S. imperialism. They wrote: The failure of U.S. imperialism in Cuba is the same as its failure in Korea. The great achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers have set an example for the Cuban people, the Latin American people, and the people of the world in opposing U.S. imperialism.

    This is the glory of the Chinese People's Volunteers. In the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, and in the anti-imperialist struggle storm widely rising among the people of the world, the heroic image of the Chinese People's Volunteers is becoming increasingly brilliant.

    On the eve of "October 25th," we visited the former Volunteer Army heroes who had made immortal contributions to the motherland and peace with a feeling of reverence. They were the old Volunteer Army soldiers who entered Korea to fight in the first batch ten years ago, and the heroes who first represented the newly standing Chinese people in a contest with the world's number one imperialism. Recalling their heroic deeds is of profound significance. Zhao Zilin, the hero of the Yunshan battle, said: "At that time, the ferocious U.S. imperialism invaded Korea, occupied our Taiwan, expanded its war of aggression, and ran rampant for a while,妄想 trying to strangle the new China in its cradle. However, it was blind. The new China cannot be deceived! With boundless anger towards the aggressors, we bravely crossed the Yalu River and finally defeated the armed-to-the-teeth American robbers with inferior equipment..." This young hero was only twenty years old that year. He came from a newly liberated peasant family in the border area of Yunnan, joined the Volunteer Army, carried a rifle and a bag of fried noodles, crossed the Yalu River, and rushed to the war-torn Korean battlefield. He and his troops were head-on with the rampant northward invading U.S. "ace" army—the 1st Cavalry Division, which had more than 100 years of military history and had participated in two world wars. It was clamoring to cross the Yalu River. What a ferocious enemy! Our heroic fighters, regardless of their own safety, bravely attacked the invading army head-on. This was October 25, 1950—the day that shook the world. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers won their first victory on the Yunshan battlefield, and together with the Korean People's Army, wiped out more than 3,000 enemies in one fell swoop, bravely opening the great prelude to the Chinese people's "Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, Safeguarding the Home and Defending the Country." The young hero Zhao Zilin, on this day, raided Yunshan City at night with three comrades. He, with his wounded body, used demolition tubes and grenades to destroy the American robbers' tanks and cars, making the first contribution to the motherland and peace. Now, ten years have passed, Zhao Zilin said proudly when talking about the first battle to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea: "On this day, we pierced the painted skin of the American paper tiger in front of the people of the world!"

    We also visited the old Volunteer Army soldiers who had experienced the five battles—five victories in five battles. Sun Degong, a former battalion commander of the Volunteer Army's "Baiyun Mountain Regiment" who had fought from the Yalu River to the "38th Parallel" and won merits in the Han River blocking battle, said, take the sixty-day Han River blocking battle as an example. At that time, the enemy's strength was two or three times greater than ours, and their artillery fire was dozens of times greater than ours. The enemy's planes and artillery poured tons of steel onto our army's positions, bombing the white mountains into black mountains. How rampant the enemy was! But we were victorious. Our soldiers guarded the cold and frozen field fortifications, endured hunger and starvation, and fought hard, bravely attacking the enemy with rifles, machine guns, and grenades. Sometimes, when the bullets and grenades ran out, they swung stones and mattocks to fight the enemy. The immortal "Yang Gensi-style" hero Wang Ying, at the critical moment of the battle, picked up the last package of explosives on the position and rushed into the enemy group, perishing together with a platoon of enemies. The "Baiyun Mountain Regiment" defended its position for eleven days and nights, wiping out more than 1,100 enemies. Facts have proved that with our heroic tenacity, the enemy has no prestige!

    Sun Jinghua, the former flight squadron leader of the Volunteer Army Air Force, shot down five enemy planes in the Korean War and was awarded first-class merit. He told us that at that time, enemy planes were bombing and strafing the Korean people madly every day. These aerial bandits could even drop thousand-pound bombs on a Korean child without any weapons. But with the support of the motherland, we quickly grew wings, drove the "silver eagles," and flew to the front. Sun Jinghua told reporters: "At that time, although we were far inferior to the enemy in terms of technology and air combat experience, most of the American flying thieves were veteran pilots who had participated in World War II and had more than 1,000 hours of flight time; while we had just learned to fly and lacked air combat experience. But we firmly believe that people determine the victory or defeat of war, believe in our own justice and courage, and with the support of the heroic people, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome and no enemies that cannot be defeated."

    Two years ago, when these heroes returned home triumphantly, we stood under the triumphal arch on the banks of the Yalu River to welcome them. They returned smiling on the East wind. Today, when the heroes recall their glorious achievements, they all express their deep belief that the people's just struggle will surely be victorious. They warmly salute the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting against imperialism! Salutations to the heroic Korean people and the heroic Korean People's Army comrades who guard the outpost of socialism in the East!

    “十·二五”访“打虎”英雄
    新华社记者　姜庆肇　李健羽
    在中国人民革命军事博物馆抗美援朝战争馆留言簿上，有着站在反对美帝国主义斗争前哨古巴朋友的一段题词，他们写道：美帝国主义在古巴的失败，就和它在朝鲜的失败一样。中国人民志愿军的伟大功迹，已经为古巴人民、拉丁美洲人民和全世界人民树立了反对美帝国主义的榜样。
    这是中国人民志愿军的光荣。在东风压倒西风的形势下，在全世界人民广泛兴起的反帝斗争风暴中，中国人民志愿军的英雄形象越来越光辉。
    “十·二五”前夕，我们怀着崇敬的心情，访问了曾经为祖国为和平建树了不朽功勋的前志愿军英雄们。他们是十年前第一批入朝作战的志愿军老战士，是首先代表着刚刚站起来的中国人民同世界上头号帝国主义较量过的英雄们。回忆一下他们的英雄事迹，是有着深刻意义的。云山战役的英雄赵子林说：“那时候，凶恶的美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，霸占我国台湾，扩大侵略战争，横行一时，妄想用飞机大炮把新中国扼死在摇篮里。可是，它瞎了眼，新中国不可欺！我们怀着对侵略者无比愤怒的心情，勇往地跨过鸭绿江，以劣势装备，终于打败了武装到牙齿的美国强盗……。”这位年轻的英雄当年才二十岁，他从云南边疆刚翻身的农民家庭里走出来，参加了志愿军，扛着一支步枪和背着一袋炒面，跨过鸭绿江，奔赴战火纷飞的朝鲜战场。他和他所在的部队，迎头碰上的就是猖狂北犯的美国“王牌”军——有着一百多年建军历史，曾经参加过两次世界大战的骑兵第一师，它正叫嚣着要打过鸭绿江。好一个凶残的敌人！我们英雄的战士，奋不顾身，迎头痛击侵略军。这就是1950年10月25日——这个震撼世界的日子，英雄的中国人民志愿军首捷云山战场，和朝鲜人民军一起，一举歼敌三千多名，英勇地揭开了中国人民“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的伟大序幕。年轻的英雄赵子林，也就是在这一天和三个战友夜袭云山城的。他带着负伤的身子，用爆破筒和手榴弹炸毁了美国强盗的坦克和汽车，为祖国与和平立下第一功。现在，十年过去了，赵子林讲起抗美援朝第一仗时，自毫地说：“就在这一天，我们在全世界人民面前，把美国纸老虎的画皮戳穿了！”
    我们还访问了经历过五次战役——五战五捷的志愿军老战士们，曾经从鸭绿江边一直打过“三八”线，在汉江两岸阻击战中荣立战功的前志愿军“白云山团”的一位营长孙德功说，就拿六十天的汉江阻击战作例子吧，当时敌人的兵力比我们多两三倍，炮火比我们多几十倍，敌人的飞机大炮把成吨钢铁倾泻到我军阵地上，炸得白山变成黑山，敌人多猖狂啊，但是我们胜利了。我们的战士守卫在天寒地冻的野战工事里，忍饥挨饿艰苦奋战，用步枪、机关枪和手榴弹英勇地打击敌人，有时候子弹和手榴弹打光了，就抡起石头和洋镐同敌人拼。不朽的“杨根思式”的英雄王英，在战斗紧急关头，他抱起阵地上的最后一包炸药冲入敌群，和一个排的敌人同归于尽，“白云山团”坚守阵地十一昼夜，就消灭了一千一百多名敌人，事实证明，有我们的英勇顽强，就没有敌人的威风！
    前志愿军空军飞行大队长孙景华，在朝鲜战争中击落了敌机五架，荣立一等功，他告诉我们，当时敌人飞机天天疯狂轰炸和扫射朝鲜人民。这些空中强盗竟可以对一个手无寸铁的朝鲜孩子投下千磅炸弹。可是当我们在祖国支援下，很快长上了翅膀，驾起“银鹰”，飞向前线。孙景华向记者说：“那时候，虽然论技术论空战经验，我们都远不如敌人，美国飞贼大部分是参加过第二次世界大战的老牌飞行员，飞行时间在一千小时以上；而我们刚刚学会飞行，又缺乏空战经验。但是我们坚信决定战争胜负的是人，相信自己的正义和勇敢，又有着英雄人民的支援，就没有克服不了的困难，没有打不败的敌人。”
    两年前，当这些英雄们凯旋回国的时候，我们曾站在鸭绿江边的凯旋门下迎接过他们，他们笑乘东风而归。今天，英雄们在回忆自己光辉战绩时，都表示深信人民正义的斗争一定能胜利。他们热烈地向亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲反帝斗争中的人民致敬！向英雄的朝鲜人民，向守卫在社会主义东方前哨的英雄的朝鲜人民军战友致敬！
