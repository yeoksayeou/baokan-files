    Storing Sweet Potato Seeds for Low-lying Areas
    The western part of Qingyuan County, Hebei Province, is high-lying with a low water table, making it easy to preserve sweet potato seeds. The eastern low-lying area has a high water table, making it easy for the sweet potato seeds to rot. Every spring, sweet potato seedlings have to be transferred from communes in the higher-lying areas, often preventing planting plans from being completed on time. This year, the county party committee organized mutual support between communes and production teams, enabling one hundred and ninety-eight production teams in low-lying areas to sign contracts with production teams in high-lying areas for preserving sweet potato seeds. Currently, communes and production teams in the high-lying areas have already arranged land plots for preserving sweet potato seeds for their brother communes and teams.

    代低洼区保管薯种
    河北省清苑县西部高，东部低洼，高的地方水位低，薯种易于保存；低洼区水位高，保存薯种容易腐烂，每年春季都要从高岗地区的公社调薯秧，往往不能按时完成栽种计划。今年，县委组织各公社、生产队之间相互挂钩，使一百九十八个低洼地区的生产队和高岗地区的生产队订了保存薯种的合同。现在，高岗地区的公社和生产队，已经安排好给兄弟社队保存薯种的地块。
