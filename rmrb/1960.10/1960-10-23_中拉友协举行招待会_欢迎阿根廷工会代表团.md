Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: Chu Tunan, President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association, said to Argentine and Chilean friends today that the Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Argentine and Latin American peoples to safeguard national independence and oppose U.S. imperialism. He said that the Argentine workers, uniting and forming a broad united front against U.S. imperialism, will ultimately be able to defeat U.S. imperialism and the reactionary forces within Argentina.

This evening, Chu Tunan met with the Argentine Trade Union Delegation and representatives from the Argentine and Chilean film industries, and held a reception to welcome these Latin American friends.

At the reception, Chu Tunan said that although China, Argentina, and Chile are separated by vast oceans, and despite the various obstructions and sabotage by U.S. imperialism between us, the friendly exchanges between our Chinese people and the people of your two countries to promote mutual understanding and friendship have increasingly developed in recent years.

Present at the reception today were all members of the Argentine Trade Union Delegation, headed by Juan Iapichino, Secretary of the Unified Movement of the Argentine National Food Industry Workers, as well as Emile Natla, General Manager of the Argentine American Film Company, and Manager Xingema, and Aguirre, a Chilean film distributor.

Chu Tunan told the Latin American friends that the Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Latin American peoples, and the Chinese people admire the Argentine workers for their just struggle to demand democratic rights, oppose interference in trade unions, oppose U.S. imperialism, and safeguard national interests. He said that in the past year or so, the Argentine workers' heroic anti-imperialist struggle has achieved great success, uniting and strengthening their ranks. We firmly believe that the Argentine workers, united and forming a broad united front against U.S. imperialism, will continue to achieve even more brilliant successes in the future, and will ultimately be able to defeat U.S. imperialism and the reactionary forces within Argentina.

Chu Tunan pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Latin American peoples, and the number one enemy of our Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world. He said that U.S. imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan, and in the struggle against U.S. imperialism, we support each other. He emphasized that your struggle powerfully inspires and supports the Chinese people. Your victory is also the victory of our Chinese people. He expressed his firm belief that the friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of Argentina and Chile will be increasingly consolidated and developed as we struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Rubens Iscaro, a member of the Argentine Trade Union Delegation, spoke at the reception, saying that the Argentine and Chinese peoples are united in the struggle against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism. He emphasized that for the sake of our common struggle, we must further strengthen the unity and strength of the Chinese and Argentine peoples, strengthen mutual support among the peoples of Latin American countries, strengthen support for the Cuban Revolution, strengthen ties with Chinese trade unions, and learn from China's experience.

Rubens Iscaro also stated that in the struggle to restore China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, in the struggle to win lasting world peace, to forever end the colonial system, and to win democracy and freedom for the peoples of all countries, we will forever be united. He further pointed out that the people of the socialist camp are friends of the Argentine people. In the future, we must take practical actions to oppose imperialism, and in this struggle, strengthen our unity with the socialist camp and the peoples of all countries.

Also present at the reception were Xu Guangxiao, Vice Minister of Culture; Zhou Erfu, Vice President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association; Huang Minwei, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Water Conservancy and Electric Power Trade Union; and Shao Naifen, Deputy Director of the International Liaison Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and others.
