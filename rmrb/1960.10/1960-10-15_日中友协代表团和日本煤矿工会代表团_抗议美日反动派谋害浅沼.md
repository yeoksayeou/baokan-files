Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: The head of the China-Japan Friendship Association delegation, Shinichiro Omori, issued a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters regarding the assassination of Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma by a fascist thug, saying that the Japanese people must conduct a broader and deeper struggle. He said that the struggle against the US-Japan Security Treaty is related to the fate of the Japanese people, this struggle is just, and it will surely be victorious.

He pointed out that the murder of Inejiro Asanuma is a blatant and barbaric attack by US imperialism and its running dogs, the Japanese reactionary ruling group, on the struggle of the Japanese people. However, the Japanese people must fight and fight again.

Shinichiro Omori said that the Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan Security Treaty is a heavy blow to US imperialism. The US-Japan reactionaries are afraid of the development of a broad united front of the Japanese people, and therefore brutally attacked Chairman Asanuma, who stood at the forefront of the struggle. He said that when Asanuma visited China, he announced that he would overthrow the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people—US imperialism. The US ambassador to Japan once forced him to retract what he said, but Asanuma resolutely refused and resolutely fought for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and the overthrow of US imperialism. His heroic actions will forever live in the hearts of the Japanese people.

Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: The Japanese Coal Miners' Union delegation currently visiting China sent telegrams yesterday from Beijing to the headquarters of the Japan Socialist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the headquarters of the Japan Coal Miners' Union, expressing their condolences for the death of Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma. The telegrams all stated: "We respectfully pray for the repose of the soul of the warrior Chairman Asanuma, who died unexpectedly due to the heinous imperialist conspiracy, and at the same time hope to launch a resolute struggle to overthrow imperialism. We express our determination in China to fight alongside you." At the same time, the delegation also sent a telegram to Japanese Prime Minister Ikeda regarding the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, pointing out that the occurrence of this incident is his political responsibility, lodging a strong protest with him, and demanding that he resign immediately and dissolve the Diet.

    抗议美日反动派谋害浅沼
    新华社14日讯　日中友好协会访华代表团团长大森真一郎就日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎被法西斯暴徒杀害一事向新华社记者发表谈话说，日本人民一定要进行更广泛深入的斗争。他说，反对日美安全条约的斗争，关系到日本人民的命运，这个斗争是正义的，一定会取得胜利。
    他指出，浅沼稻次郎的被害，是美帝国主义及其走狗日本反动统治集团对日本人民斗争的露骨的、野蛮的攻击。但是，日本人民要斗争再斗争。
    大森真一郎说，日本人民反对日美安全条约的斗争是对美帝国主义的沉重打击。美日反动派害怕日本人民广泛统一战线的发展，因此对站在斗争前列的浅沼委员长下了毒手。他说，浅沼在访华时曾宣布要打倒中日人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义。美国驻日大使曾逼他收回他所讲的话，但是浅沼坚决拒绝并坚决为恢复日中邦交、打倒美帝国主义而斗争。他的英勇行动将永远活在日本人民的心里。
    新华社14日讯　正在我国访问的日本煤矿工会访华代表团，昨天从北京分别打电报给日本社会党本部、日本工会总评议会本部和日本煤矿工会本部，对日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎遇刺逝世表示哀悼。电报中都说：“谨向由于毒辣的帝国主义阴谋而不测逝世的战士浅沼委员长之灵祈祷瞑福，同时希望开始进行坚决打倒帝国主义的斗争。我们在中国表示决心，与你们共同奋斗。”同时，这个代表团还就杀害浅沼稻次郎事件打电报给日本内阁首相池田，指出这一事件的发生是他的政治责任，向他提出强烈抗议，并要求他引咎立即解散国会。
