    “Commodity Hospital”
    From morning till night, the Dongsi People's Market is bustling with people coming and going. Some are walking out carrying repaired items, while others are bringing old and broken items for repair. One customer, carrying two large bundles of old and broken items, approached the repair department and asked: "What kind of repairs do you do?" The service員 responded: "We repair whatever you need repaired." The customer handed over a pile of worn-out leather shoes, torn socks, old cotton-padded clothes, and broken woolen sweaters to the service員. A few days later, the customer came to pick up the items, and upon examination, found that everything had been repaired.
    This market offers as many as 335 types of repair services, handling over 700 items daily. Whether it's people's daily necessities or certain production machines, they accept everything that comes their way and undertake all repairs. In July and August alone, they repaired 1,280 tools, such as iron spades, hoes, and hand hoes, for the Heping Commune. Customers call this market the "Commodity Hospital."

    “商品医院”
    东四人民市场每天从早到晚熙熙攘攘的人川流不息，有的提着修好的物品往外走，有的拿着废旧物品送来修理。一位顾客抱着两大包袱废旧物品走到修理部问：都是修理什么？服务员回答说：你需要修理什么我们就修理什么。顾客把一堆破皮鞋、破袜子、旧棉衣、破绒衣交给了服务员。过了几天，这位顾客来取东西了，拿出来一看，都修理好了。
    这个市场的修理项目多达三百三十五种，每天接修七百余件。无论是人们的日常生活用品，还是某些生产机具，他们都是来者不拒，一概承修。仅7、8两月，他们就为和平公社修理了铁铣、镐头、手锄等工具一千二百八十件，顾客称这个商场是“商品医院”。
