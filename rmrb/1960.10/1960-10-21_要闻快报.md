	Hanyang Steel Rolling Mill Produces Multiple Varieties
	The Hanyang Steel Rolling Mill in Hubei Province persists in implementing the leadership methods of cadres participating in “four togethers” (eating, living, working and studying together with the workers) and cultivating “experimental plots”. They deeply mobilize the masses to innovate production equipment, striving to increase the production of steel products such as light steel rails, to support the needs of mines, forests, and transportation construction both inside and outside the province. Since the beginning of this year, among the fifteen types of steel produced by the factory, eight types of special-shaped steel have been successfully trial-produced this year. In addition, they have also produced various specifications and structures of steel wire ropes and steel strands. The factory's steel output has also been steadily increasing, and by the 15th of this month, it had completed about 98% of its annual production target.
	Experience of “Three Shifts for One Furnace” Develops
	The No. 1 Steelmaking Workshop of the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant in Shanxi creatively promoted the experience of the No. 7 converter of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company with "three shifts for one furnace". While improving the vertical cooperative relationship of "three shifts for one furnace" of the converter itself, it also used the method of "one shift guaranteeing three furnaces, furnaces competing with each other" to improve the horizontal cooperative relationship between converters, and between converters and other processes. In the competition between shifts, they organize competitions comparing good cooperation, high output, good quality, and low consumption. Between furnaces, they organize competitions comparing high ingot yield, fast blowing, low blowing loss, and low tuyere consumption. This resulted in a new situation of coordinated cooperation between shifts of one furnace, between furnaces of the same shift, and between different production links such as iron melting, transportation, smelting, and casting on the same production chain. This promoted the continuous increase in steel output and steel pass rate since late September, and the continuous decrease in pig iron consumption per ton of steel. The entire workshop of converter steelmaking completed and overfulfilled the production plan on a daily and ten-day basis.
	Anshan Iron and Steel Draws Leading Cadres to Strengthen the Front Line
	Anshan Iron and Steel recently transferred more than 1,400 leading cadres, including party committee secretaries, managers, functional department heads, and factory and mine directors, factory and mine party committee secretaries, and workshop directors, from company offices and various factories and mines, to lower levels, enriching the front line of production. Some of these leading cadres went to mining faces to serve as section chiefs, and some went to blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces as party branch secretaries and furnace foremen, specifically helping grassroots cadres to grasp ideology, management, and key points, which greatly strengthened grassroots leadership and powerfully promoted production. Chen Xiaofa, a national labor model and deputy director of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, and Li Shaokui, deputy director of the open hearth workshop, helped workers create a set of advanced operating methods after arriving at the relatively backward No. 5 open hearth furnace, making this relatively backward open hearth furnace one of the most advanced open hearth furnaces in the entire plant.
	Give Play to the Role of New Frontline Personnel
	After vigorously transferring ground personnel and non-production personnel to strengthen the frontline of mining in the Nan'an District of Chongqing, Sichuan, various coal mines took timely measures to quickly bring into play the role of the newly added frontline personnel. By carrying out on-site technical training on a large scale, launching mentor-apprentice contracts between veteran workers and new apprentices, and veteran workers' roving teaching, new workers quickly mastered production technology and properly arranged this new force, promoting a substantial increase in coal and coke production. Compared with July, the average daily output of raw coal in the district after personnel were transferred to strengthen the production frontline increased by 45.9 percent in August, and coke increased by 5.6 percent. As the technical level and labor efficiency of the new apprentices improved, the average daily output of raw coal in the district in September increased by 12.6 percent compared with August, and coke increased by 31 percent.
	Qingdao Handicraft Industry Achieves High Quality, High Output, and Multiple Varieties
	In the increase production and practice economy movement, handicraft workers in Qingdao launched a large-scale competition of high quality, high output, low consumption, and multiple varieties. Various units carried out technical innovation and technical revolution targeting key aspects of production, which powerfully promoted the improvement of output and quality. Employees of various units also worked diligently and thriftily, carefully calculating and comprehensively utilizing raw materials, effectively reducing costs and raw material consumption. In August and September, all major handicraft products in the city completed and overfulfilled the output plan, the cost of comparable products decreased by 20.94 percent, the quality of various products also improved significantly, and 248 new products and 6,152 new patterns were successfully trial-produced.

    要闻快报
    汉阳轧钢厂生产多品种
    湖北省汉阳轧钢厂坚持实行干部“四同”和种“试验田”的领导方法，深入地发动群众革新生产设备，努力增产轻型钢轨等钢材品种，支援省内外矿山、森林和交通运输建设的需要。今年以来，这个厂生产的十五种钢材品种中，有八种异型钢材是在今年先后试制成功的，另外还生产了各种规格和结构不同的钢丝绳和钢绞线，全厂钢材的产量也节节上升，本月十五日已完成全年生产任务的百分之九十八左右。
    “三班为一炉”的经验有发展
    山西长治钢铁厂第一炼钢车间创造性地推广太原钢铁公司第二炼钢厂七号转炉“三班为一炉”的经验，在搞好“三班为一炉”的转炉本身纵的协作关系的同时，又以“一班保三炉、炉炉互比武”的方法，搞好转炉与转炉，转炉与其他工序之间横的协作关系，在班与班之间组织比协作好、比产量高、比质量好、比消耗低和在炉与炉之间组织比成锭高、比吹炼快、比吹损少、比风眼消耗低的“四比”竞赛，从而使一个炉的班与班之间，同一个班的炉与炉之间、和同一根生产链条上的化铁、运输、冶炼、浇铸等不同生产环节之间出现了合纵连横的协作配合，和班班炉炉优质高产的新局面，促使九月下旬以来，钢产量和钢的合格率不断提高，每吨钢的生铁消耗不断下降，全车间转炉炼钢按日按旬地完成和超额完成了生产计划。
