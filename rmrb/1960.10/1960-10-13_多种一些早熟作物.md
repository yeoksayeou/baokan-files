Plant More Early-Maturing Crops

    According to Xinhua News Agency reports, Sichuan, upholding the spirit of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and based on summarizing past years' experiences in increasing production, has decided during this year's autumn planting to seize favorable opportunities and mobilize the masses to plant more early-maturing crops. The aim is to achieve early planting and early harvest, and to obtain more grain and vegetables next summer than in any previous year. This approach deserves attention in all regions. While ensuring the completion of wheat sowing plans during autumn planting, it is important to rationally arrange crop rotations, increase land utilization, and appropriately plant more early-maturing crops (barley, naked barley, rapeseed, peas, broad beans, and vegetables). This is an important measure to guarantee increased grain production.

    Planting more early-maturing crops in the autumn has many benefits. First, from the perspective of production layout, it can fully tap the potential of the land, increase land utilization, and transform single-cropping into double-cropping, or double-cropping into triple-cropping. For example, some communes in the Huaihe River rice-growing areas of Anhui and some communes in the Yangtze River double-cropping rice areas plant early-maturing summer-harvest crops in the winter-fallow fields before rice. After harvesting, they plant rice, and after the rice harvest, they plant autumn-harvest crops, thus achieving three harvests a year. Some areas have traditionally only grown one crop a year. If they change their farming habits and plant barley this year, then harvest it next year before planting the main autumn crop, they can change from single-cropping to double-cropping. Some early-maturing crops, such as peas, broad beans, rapeseed, and certain vegetables, can be intercropped or relay-cropped with wheat, or planted on field edges and corners. This increases the multiple cropping index within a certain space and increases the sown area. China's multiple cropping index is quite high, but the situation varies greatly from place to place. The south has a warm climate and a long frost-free period, and is densely populated, so the land's multiple cropping index is higher. However, the situation also differs between provinces in the south. Sichuan has the highest, with a multiple cropping index of 250%-300%; Yunnan, with similar natural conditions, only has a multiple cropping index of about 150%. Even in Sichuan, where the multiple cropping index is higher, the situation is not balanced across all areas. Some mountainous areas still have a relatively low multiple cropping index. If we can fully utilize the differences in height, growth time, and nutrient requirements between grain crops and vegetable crops, tall crops and short crops, and gramineous crops and leguminous crops, and fully leverage their interdependence and mutual promotion, implementing rational intercropping and relay-cropping, we can greatly increase land utilization and further increase crop yields. The Jia Zhuang Production Brigade of the Yangying Street Commune in Zhenping County, Henan, intercrops wheat and peas, generally increasing production by about 25% to 30% compared to monoculture wheat. Peas can protect wheat from lodging, and can also use the nitrogen fixation of rhizobia to supply nutrients to wheat. They can also provide shade and conserve moisture, reducing the evaporation and loss of fertilizer and water in the soil; wheat can also protect peas from wind damage. This production team's wheat-pea intercropping area reached about 40% of the autumn planting area this year. The Mazhuang Production Team of the Yangdang Commune in Zaoyang County, Hubei, plans to plant 2,700 mu this autumn, intending to intercrop peas in 500 mu of wheat and plant another 400 mu of barley, relay-cropping sorghum in the spring. Wheat develops slowly in winter, leaving large gaps in the ground. Utilizing this opportunity to sow a season of vegetables can yield several thousand catties of vegetables per mu. As long as attention is paid to management, it will not affect wheat growth and development.

    Appropriately planting more early-maturing crops also facilitates clearing the land for summer crops, advancing the sowing time of summer crops, and increasing the yield of summer crops. "One day in spring planting is like one hour in summer planting." According to a survey in Yiliang County, Yunnan, with the same soil and identical management conditions, if rice seedlings are transplanted in May, the rice yield per mu can reach 800 catties; delaying transplanting by half a month will reduce the yield by 100 to 200 catties.

    Appropriately planting more early-maturing crops also facilitates the rational arrangement of labor and farm work, and improves the quality of harvesting, management, and planting. Due to the seasonality of agricultural production and farming habits, farm work is most intense during several busy agricultural seasons. Summer is a very busy time, requiring both the harvesting of summer crops and the planting of summer crops. Often, in order to rush to harvest wheat, the summer planting time is delayed, affecting the quality of sowing. Planting more early-maturing crops allows crops to mature successively, making labor allocation more flexible, and improving the quality of harvesting, planting, and field management, thereby increasing the total crop yield. The Houying Production Team of the Shagou Commune in Huaiyuan County, Anhui, planted more early-maturing crops last autumn. This year, they finished harvesting and planting more than ten days before "Xiaoman" (Grain Full), completing the farm work originally concentrated within fifteen days in twenty-seven days. This greatly alleviated the labor shortage and greatly improved the quality of work.

    Early-maturing crops have a short growing period, maturing successively in March and April of the following year (vegetables have an even shorter growing period and can be harvested around the Spring Festival). Early planting, early harvest, and early connections to new crops help to better arrange the lives of the masses in the spring. In most parts of China, there are two harvests a year, namely the summer harvest in May and June and the autumn harvest in August, September, and October. The autumn harvest is the main harvest season for grain crops, but there are eight or nine months between the autumn harvest of this year and the summer harvest of the following year. Because the time is too long, the lives of the masses in the spring are often not easily arranged. Especially this year, many areas in China have suffered severe natural disasters. Planting more early-maturing crops this year, which will mature successively next spring, will facilitate adjusting the lives of the masses and making their lives better. At the same time, there is a shortage of green fodder in winter, and planting more early-maturing crops can also solve part of the feed problem and promote the development of animal husbandry.

    In the past, due to the limitations of the small-scale peasant economy, most farmers could only manage one or two crops a year. Although people knew that planting more early-maturing crops had many benefits, they still planted very few due to limitations in labor, livestock, and fertilizer. Field management was also relatively extensive. Therefore, the yields of some early-maturing crops, such as barley, naked barley, peas, and broad beans, were relatively low. Now, relying on the great strength of the people's communes, it is possible to plan crop rotations, rationally implement close planting, and implement rotation, intercropping, and relay-cropping systems, so that the yields of early-maturing crops gradually increase. Time is now very tight. People's communes in all regions must take immediate action, adapt to local conditions, make reasonable arrangements, appropriately plant more early-maturing crops, and strive for timely sowing and strengthen field management, firing the first shot for a bumper agricultural harvest next year!

    多种一些早熟作物
    据新华社消息，四川各地本着大办农业、大办粮食的精神，通过总结历年的增产经验，在今年秋种中，决定抓紧有利时机，发动群众多种一些早熟作物，力争早种早收，在明年夏季拿到比以往任何一年都多的粮食和蔬菜。这种作法值得引起各地注意。在秋种中保证完成小麦播种计划的前提下，合理安排茬口，提高土地利用率，适当多种一些早熟作物（大麦、元麦、油菜、豌豆、蚕豆和蔬菜），是保证更多增产粮食的一项重要措施。
    在秋季适当多种一些早熟作物，好处很多。首先，从生产布局来看，可以充分挖掘土地潜力，提高土地利用率，变一年一熟为一年二熟，或变一年二熟为一年三熟。例如，安徽淮北水稻地区的一部分公社和沿江双季稻地区的一部分公社，在水稻前茬的冬闲田里种上早熟夏收作物，收获以后再栽水稻，水稻后茬再种秋熟作物，这样一年可以收获三季。有些地区向来只种一季庄稼，如果改变耕作习惯，今年多种一季大麦，明年收了，再种大秋作物，就能变一年一熟为一年两熟。有些早熟作物，例如豌豆、蚕豆、油菜和某些蔬菜，可以和小麦间作、套种，或种在田边、地角，在一定空间以内提高复种指数，增加播种面积。我国的农田复种指数是相当高的，但各地的情况很不平衡。南方气候温暖，无霜期长，居民稠密，土地的复种指数较高。但南方各省情况也不一样。四川最高，复种指数达250％—300％；自然条件相差不多的云南，复种指数只有150％左右。在复种指数较高的四川，各地情况也不平衡，有些山区复种指数还相当低。我们如果能够充分利用粮食作物和蔬菜作物、高秆作物和低秆作物、禾本科作物和豆科作物的高矮不同、生长时间不同、所需养分不尽相同的特点，充分发挥它们互相依赖和互相促进的一面，实行合理的间作套种，完全可以大大提高土地的利用率，进一步提高作物的产量。河南镇平县杨营街公社贾庄生产大队以小麦和豌豆混作，一般比单种小麦增产25％到30％左右。豌豆可以保护小麦不使倒伏，又能利用根瘤菌的固氮作用，为小麦供应养分，还可以遮荫保墒，减少土壤中肥分和水分的蒸发流失；小麦也能保护豌豆减轻风害。这个生产队今年麦豆混作面积达到秋种面积的40％左右。湖北枣阳县杨挡公社马庄生产队今年秋播二千七百亩，打算在五百亩小麦内套种豌豆，另种四百亩大麦，明春套种高粱。小麦在冬季发育缓慢，地面空隙很大，利用这个机会，播种一季蔬菜，每亩可以多收几千斤蔬菜，只要注意经营管理，并不会影响小麦生长发育。
    适当多种一些早熟作物，还便于为夏茬作物腾地，提早夏播作物的播种时间，增加夏播作物的产量。“春种一日，夏种一时”，据云南宜良县调查，同样的土壤，并且管理条件相同，如果5月栽秧，水稻亩产可达八百斤；迟半个月栽秧，产量便将减少一、二百斤。
    适当多种一些早熟作物，还便于合理安排劳力和农活，提高收、管、种的工作质量。由于农业生产的季节性和耕作习惯的影响，一年的农活在几个农忙季节最为紧张。夏季是大忙时间，既要抢收夏收作物，又要抢种夏播作物。往往为了抢收小麦，推迟了夏播时间，影响了播种质量。多种一些早熟作物，庄稼陆续成熟，劳力调配更加从容，可以提高收、种和田间管理的质量，提高作物的总产量。安徽怀远县沙沟公社候营生产队，去年秋季多种了早熟作物，今年在“小满”前十多天收完种完，把原来集中在十五天内的农活，提前在二十七天内完成了，这就大大缓和了劳力紧张情况，并且大大提高了工作质量。
    早熟作物生长期短，来年3、4月间陆续成熟（蔬菜的生长期更短，春节前后即可采摘），早种早收早接新，有助于更好地安排春季群众的生活。我国多数地区一年收获两次，即5、6月间的夏收和8、9、10月间的秋收。秋收为粮食作物的主要收获季节，但从本年秋收到来年夏收，中间距离八、九个月。由于时间太长，春季的群众生活往往不易安排。特别是今年，我国不少地区遭受了严重的天灾，今年多种一些早熟作物，到明年春季先后成熟，便于调剂群众生活，把群众生活安排得更好。同时，冬季青饲料缺乏，多种一些早熟作物，也可以解决一部分饲料问题，促进畜牧业的发展。
    过去，由于小农经济的限制，多数农户一年只能经营一季或者两季庄稼；人们虽然知道多种早熟作物有很多好处，但是由于劳力、牲口、肥料等条件的限制，还是种得很少的，田间管理也是比较粗放的。因此，一部分早熟作物，如大麦、元麦、豌豆、蚕豆的产量都比较低。现在，依靠人民公社的伟大力量，可以有计划地安排茬口，有计划地实行合理密植和轮作、间作、套种制度，使早熟作物的产量日渐提高。现在时间已很紧迫，各地人民公社要立即行动起来，因地制宜，合理安排，适当多种一些早熟作物，并且力争适时播种，加强田间管理，给明年的农业丰收打响第一炮！
