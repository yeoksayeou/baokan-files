    The red flag waves, our People's Republic, heroically strides through the first year of its second decade. As the cannons roar and cheers thunder in Tiananmen Square, a giant red flag unfurls before our eyes—the red flag of the General Line. Its shimmering golden light guides us as we wield the giant axe of labor and the sword of wisdom to cut through thorns, carve mountains, and open rivers, propelling the historical chariot of socialist construction fearlessly forward.

    The red flag waves, the leaping steed of the Great Leap Forward continues its bold gallop on our avenue of construction. This year, the working class is determined to produce 18.4 million tons of steel, which means producing 5 million tons more than last year. This is no easy feat! Five million tons is nearly the entire steel production of 1957. But what we say, we must do. Now, nine months have passed, what is the situation? In the first eight months alone, steel production exceeded the entire steel production of 1958 by several million tons, almost equaling the steel production of the previous eleven months. Past achievements can never be a basis for complacency. Our steelworkers have made a new resolution: to strive to exceed "18.4 million tons." To exceed it means conquering more difficulties. But this is already a habit for us. From 158,000 tons of steel in 1949 to 13.35 million tons in 1959, how many difficulties have we conquered! What we have gained is the victory of high speed.

    How far have we advanced in these eleven years? You don't have to go to the giant steel bases of Anshan, Wuhan, or Baotou to find a clear sign of this. Just visit the small Keyi Hardware Factory in Shanghai. This small factory has a half-ton electric furnace, and on September 19th of this year, this small electric furnace produced 40 tons of steel. It doesn't seem like a miracle. Forty tons is an extremely small number in Shanghai's total daily steel production, accounting for less than one percent. However, when you look back at history, you will discover from this record of 40 tons per day from a small electric furnace that we have already climbed from the plains to the mountains. In 1948, Shanghai produced 6,964 tons of steel for the entire year, averaging 19 tons per day. Now, a half-ton electric furnace in the Keyi Hardware Factory produces 40 tons a day, equivalent to twice the entire daily steel production of Shanghai before liberation in 1948.

    We have already advanced very far, we have already climbed to the mountains, but the road ahead is still long, and the mountains we want to climb are still high. Red flag of the Great Leap Forward, wave in the wind, we will follow you bravely forward without stopping.

    The red flag waves, the red sun of the East—the People's Communes—unleashed its earth-shattering power in 1960. This year, nature, this ferocious enemy, launched an unprecedented attack on the People's Communes. In many places in Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, there was no thorough rain for two hundred days. The mighty Yellow River revealed its parched chest; in the vast reservoirs, fish could not find a place to hide. In the Liao River and Songhua River basins, extraordinary floods turned the plains into oceans overnight. In the southeast coastal areas, fierce typhoons swept across thousands of miles, howling in. However, nature, no matter how imposing, could no longer have its way in front of the powerful opponent of the People's Communes. The People's Communes fought tenaciously against the severe disasters. Hundreds of millions of people, in an organized and magnificent disaster relief movement, snatched food and cotton from the jaws of the tiger, allowing 650 million people to live and work in peace, and making the songs of construction continue to surge on the land of China. "Thousands of miles of red land, starving people everywhere, selling children, a scene of utter misery"—these true depictions of the great disasters of the old China have disappeared without a trace today. Compilers of the history of disasters in China will have to change to a new writing method from now on and add an extremely important new chapter: The People's Commune is the most powerful weapon to conquer disasters.

    The red flag of the People's Communes waves, its infinitely powerful vitality has been tested in the struggle against severe natural disasters. It will become more and more firmly rooted in the land of China, and more and more brilliantly radiate its golden light.

    From the day the People's Republic of China was founded, the imperialists have been chanting curses for many years: China must perish. After being disillusioned year after year, this year, a great hope has rekindled in their empty hearts. They enthusiastically discovered a secret in China's ancient almanac that China would "fail" this year. It turns out that this year is the Year of Gengzi, the Year of the Rat. Every sixty years, the feng shui changes in turn, and this year is when China is supposed to be unlucky. The imperialist philosophers and apologists have reached the end of their road. After all the rumors, slanders, and smears they are accustomed to using have completely failed, they have to resort to "feng shui" to help them escape their predicament.

    Things seemed to be a bit efficacious. This year, China's feng shui was indeed not very good, which made those hired writers fed by monopoly capitalists feel a little itchy in their hearts. The spring drought made them very happy for a while, and the summer floods and typhoons made them even happier for a while. Now there is nothing to be happy about, only waiting for the good news of "China's economic collapse." But God did not come to support them at this time. The good news never came. What was even stranger was that the Chinese people ate as usual, slept as usual, happily harvested crops with sickles as usual, enthusiastically smelted steel and iron as usual, sang as usual, and watched operas as usual. Moreover, more foreigners from all corners of the world celebrated the National Day on October 1st with the Chinese people. It seems that the "Year of the Rat" did not bring any unlucky omen to China. It was not the Chinese who were unlucky, but Eisenhower, who was given the cold shoulder by the Japanese people, Syngman Rhee, who was driven off the stage by the South Korean people, and Menderes, who was driven off the stage by the Turkish people. It is the imperialists who are rampant in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Like in previous years, disappointment once again visited the heads of these liars.

    The imperialists are only familiar with China's old "feng shui," and do not understand at all that this "feng shui" was thrown into the trash can by the people eleven years ago. They only remember the Year of Gengzi one hundred and twenty years ago, in 1840, when the imperialist gunboats bombarded open the gates of China, and from then on, the imperialists rode on the necks of the Chinese people. They also only remember the Year of Gengzi sixty years ago, in 1900, when the great alliance of imperialist robbers directly stormed into Beijing, causing us another catastrophe. The Chinese people have never yielded. The revolutionary will and majestic strength of the Chinese people were displayed from the struggles against the British pacification troops and the Boxer Rebellion. It seems that the imperialists have not learned any useful lessons from this. They are once again reliving their old dreams, pinning hopes that can never be realized on the "Year of the Rat" in 1960. However, history will never repeat itself. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, our revolutionary people have fundamentally reversed the history of our country's humiliation and weakness. The old feng shui is no longer effective, and the unlucky ones will always be the imperialists and all reactionaries.

    The red flag waves, we stride into the second year of the second decade of our great motherland amidst songs of triumph. The red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes guide us forward. No one can stop our pace. Truth and victory will always be on our side!

    红旗飘飘
    张沛
    红旗飘飘，我们的人民共和国，英雄地走过了它的第二个十年的第一年。当天安门众炮齐鸣欢声雷动的时候，在我们的眼前招展着一面巨大的红旗——总路线的红旗，是它的闪闪金光，引导着我们用劳动的巨斧，用智慧的宝剑，斩荆披棘，凿山开河，使社会主义建设的历史车轮，无畏地滚滚向前。
    红旗飘飘，跃进的骏马，继续在我们的建设大道上豪放地奔驰。工人阶级在今年决心要拿到一千八百四十万吨钢，这就是说，要比去年多五百万吨。这不是一件轻而易举的小事啊，五百万吨，也就是接近1957年全年的钢产量。可是，我们说到，就一定要做到。现在九个月过去了，情况怎样了？拿头八个月来说，钢产量比1958年全年的钢产量还多几百万吨，差不多等于去年十一个月的钢产量。已有的成就从来不能成为我们自满的根据，我们的钢铁工人已经下了新的决心：力争超过“一八四○”。超过去，这也就是说，要征服更多的困难。但这对于我们已经是习惯的事了，从1949年的十五万八千吨钢到1959年的一千三百三十五万吨钢，我们征服了多少困难啊，然而我们得到的是高速度的胜利。
    十一年来，我们究竟前进得多远呢？你不必到鞍钢、武钢、包钢这些巨大的钢铁基地去寻找这种鲜明的标志，你就访问上海一个小小的科仪五金厂吧。这个小厂有一个半吨的小电炉，今年9月19日这个小电炉生产了四十吨钢。看起来，这并不是什么奇迹。四十吨，这在上海全市钢的日产量中，是一个极其微小的数目，它还占不到百分之一的位置。可是，当你翻翻历史的时候，你就会从这个小电炉日产四十吨的纪录上，发现我们已经从平地登上了高山。1948年，上海全年生产了六千九百六十四吨钢，平均每天生产十九吨钢。而现在科仪五金厂的一个半吨小电炉一天生产了四十吨，等于解放前1948年整个上海钢的日产量的两倍。
    我们已经前进得很远了，我们已经登上了高山，可是我们要走的路还长，我们要登的山还高。大跃进的红旗呵，你迎风招展吧，我们不停顿地跟着你勇敢向前。
    红旗飘飘，东方的红日——人民公社，在1960年发出了它的雷霆万钧之力。自然界这个凶恶的敌人，今年向人民公社发动了一次规模空前的袭击。晋、冀、鲁、豫许多地方两百天未落透雨，滔滔的黄河，露出了它干涸的胸膛；烟波浩淼的水库，鱼儿找不到藏身的地方。而在辽河、松花江流域，特大的洪水，一个晚上又把平地变成了海洋。在东南沿海，一次又一次猛烈的台风，横扫千里，呼啸而至。可是，威风凛凛的自然界，在人民公社这个强大的对手面前，再也不能为所欲为了。人民公社和严重的灾荒作了顽强的斗争，几亿人有组织的宏伟的抗灾运动，从虎口里夺回了粮食、棉花，使六亿五千万人民照常安居乐业，使中国大地上照常沸腾着建设的歌声。“赤地千里，饿殍盈野，卖儿鬻女，惨绝人寰”，这些旧中国历次大灾荒的真实写照，今天，消失得无影无踪了。中国灾荒史的编纂者们，从此要改换一个新的写作方法，并且要加上极为重要的新的一章：人民公社是征服灾荒的最强大的武器。
    人民公社的红旗飘飘，它的无限强大的生命力，在和严重的自然灾害的搏斗中得到了考验，它将越来越牢固地植根于中国的土地上，越来越灿烂地放射出它的万丈金光。
    从中华人民共和国成立的那一天起，帝国主义者已经念咒念了好多年：中国一定要消亡。在他们一年又一年遭到了无情的幻灭以后，今年，在他们空虚的心灵中，又燃起了巨大的希望。他们兴致勃勃地从中国的古老的历书中，发现了一个中国将在今年“失败”的秘密。原来，今年是庚子年，也就是鼠年，六十年风水轮流转，今年该是中国倒霉的时候了。帝国主义的哲学家和辩护士们已经走到了穷途末路，在他们惯于使用的一切造谣、诽谤和污蔑统统失败以后，只好借助于“风水学”来帮助他们解脱窘境。
    事情好像有点灵验，今年中国的风水确是有些不怎么好，这使得那些靠垄断资本家喂养的雇佣文士们，有点心里发痒。春天的干旱，使得他们大大高兴了一阵，夏季的洪水和台风又使他们大大高兴了一阵。现在没有什么可高兴的了，只有等待“中国经济崩溃”的好消息一件事了。可是上帝在这个时候，不再来支援他们了。好消息一直没有来。更奇怪的是中国人照常吃饭，照常睡觉，照常高高兴兴地拿着镰刀收割庄稼，照常干劲冲天地炼钢炼铁，照常唱歌，照常看戏。而且有更多的来自世界各个角落的外国人，和中国人一起欢度10月1日的国庆佳节。看起来，“鼠年”并没有给中国带来什么倒霉的象征。倒霉的不是中国人，而是遭到日本人民闭门羹的艾森豪威尔，是被南朝鲜人民赶下台的李承晚，是被土耳其人民赶下台的曼德列斯。是在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲横行霸道的帝国主义者。像往年一样，失望又一次光临到这些谎言家的头上。
    帝国主义分子只熟悉中国老的“风水学”，而根本不懂得这个“风水学”早在十一年前就被人民扔到垃圾箱去了。他们只记得一百二十年前，即1840年那一个庚子年，帝国主义的炮舰轰开了中国的大门，从此，帝国主义者骑在中国人民的脖子上，他们也只记得六十年前即1900年那一个庚子年，帝国主义强盗的大联合，一直打进了北京城，又使我们遭受一次浩劫。中国人民从来是不屈服的，从平英团、义和团的对敌斗争中，就显示了中国人民的革命意志和雄伟力量。看来，帝国主义者并未从这中间得到什么有益的教训，他们又在重温旧梦，把永远无法兑现的希望寄托在1960年这个“鼠年”了。可是，历史决不会重演，我国的革命人民在共产党和毛泽东同志领导下，已经根本扭转了我们国家屈辱和孱弱的历史，旧的风水早已不灵了，倒霉的永远是帝国主义和一切反动派。
    红旗飘飘，我们在凯歌中跨进了我们伟大祖国第二个十年的第二年。总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗在前面引导着我们，谁也阻挡不住我们前进步伐，真理和胜利永远在我们这一边！
