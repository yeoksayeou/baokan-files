Xinhua News Agency, October 17th: Mexico City Dispatch: The Third National Congress of the Mexican People's Party, recently held in Mexico City, has concluded.

The Congress expressed enthusiastic support for the Havana Declaration and the broadest and most resolute solidarity with the Cuban revolutionary government. The Congress also advocated the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and expressed support for Algeria's patriotic struggle for national independence.

In its statement on the domestic political situation, the Congress advocated that Mexico completely free itself from the shackles of imperialism in economic and political terms. Participants also advocated that the working class and peasants form an alliance with the small national bourgeoisie, thereby establishing a national democratic and patriotic liberation front of the country.

The Congress adopted the report of the party's national leadership, proposed revisions to the party program and constitution, and elected new leadership. Lombardo Toledano was re-elected as the Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the party. The Congress also decided to rename the People's Party as the People's Socialist Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, October 15th: The Argentine Socialist Party held a warm mass rally last night to pay tribute to Cuba. The masses present continuously and enthusiastically shouted slogans such as "Cuba yes, Yankees no!".

Walter Valle, who attended the First Latin American Youth Congress held in Havana in August, spoke on behalf of the Socialist Youth Organization. He said: "In Latin America, nine thousand kilometers away from us, facing the United States, there is a Cuba, which proves that it is possible to achieve sovereignty, oppose US imperialism and turn itself into a truly free land of Latin America."

Alfredo Palacios, a leader of the Socialist Party, strongly condemned the United States at the meeting as the exploiter of the people of Latin American countries. He said that Cuba's actions show that the country has achieved sovereignty and independence. Those who try to see something else behind this are serving the interests of imperialism.

At the mass rally, some anonymous people threw a blasting tube. At this time, Mr. Valle, who was speaking, pointed out, "I would like to repeat what Fidel Castro said when a bomb exploded during his speech: Go and get a check from (American) Bank of Boston." Those present enthusiastically supported his speech and shouted patriotic slogans such as "Yankees get out of Latin America!" and "Shoot the traitors!"

Xinhua News Agency, October 18th: According to the Latin American News Agency: People in some Latin American countries continue to express support for the Havana Declaration and the Cuban Revolution.

The Costa Rican Association of Friends of the Cuban Revolution recently organized a mass rally and handed over a list of signatures expressing support for the Havana Declaration to the Cuban Ambassador to Costa Rica. It is reported that in Costa Rica, 20,000 signatures were collected in just one week.

In a recent statement, the Workers' Union of Esuai Province, Ecuador, expressed support for the Havana Declaration. The statement pointed out that the Havana Declaration reflects "the true ideals and just and lofty cause of the people of Latin American countries." At a mass rally in Kunka, the main city of the province, in support of the Cuban Revolution, workers also severely condemned the resolutions passed at the meeting of foreign ministers of the American countries held in San Jose, especially the "Declaration of San Jose" imposed on the meeting by the United States. Participants pointed out that the "Declaration of San Jose" is "contrary to the true interests of the Latin American people, especially the interests of the poor and working people." The congress declared that those who signed these resolutions "do not represent their own people."

Brazilian newspapers such as "Jornal do Brasil", "Ultima Hora", and "Diário do Brasil" have recently published commentaries expressing support for Cuba's measures to nationalize some enterprises and build houses for the people.

    据新华社17日讯　墨西哥城消息：墨西哥人民党最近在墨西哥城举行的第三次全国代表大会已经闭幕。
    代表大会表示热烈支持哈瓦那宣言和最广泛和坚决地声援古巴革命政府。代表大会还主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，并表示支持阿尔及利亚争取民族独立的爱国主义斗争。
    代表大会在国内政局的声明中主张墨西哥在经济和政治方面完全摆脱帝国主义的束缚。与会者还主张工人阶级和农民同小的民族资产阶级结成联盟，从而建立国家的民族民主爱国解放阵线。
    这次代表大会通过了这个党的全国领导机构的报告，对党纲和党章提出了修改，并选举了新的领导机构。伦巴托·托列达诺再次当选为这个党的中央委员会总书记。代表大会还决定把人民党改名为人民社会党。
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯15日电阿根廷社会党昨晚举行了向古巴致敬的热烈的群众大会，到会群众不断地热情高呼：“要古巴，不要美国佬”等口号。
    曾经出席了8月在哈瓦那召开的拉丁美洲青年第一次代表大会的华尔特·巴列代表社会党青年组织在会上讲了话。他说：“在拉丁美洲距离我们九千公里，面对美国的地方有一个古巴，它证明了有可能取得主权，反对美帝国主义和把自己变成拉丁美洲真正自由的国土。”
    社会党领导人阿尔弗雷多·帕拉西奥斯在会上强烈地谴责美国是拉丁美洲各国人民的剥削者。他说，古巴的行动表明，这个国家已取得了主权和独立。那些妄图在这后面看到另外的东西的人是为帝国主义的利益服务的。
    在群众大会上，一些匿名者投掷了一个爆破筒。这时正在讲话的巴列先生指出，“我想重复菲德尔·卡斯特罗当他在讲话过程中有炸弹爆破时所说的话：你们去拿（美国）波士顿银行的支票吧。”到会者热烈拥护他的发言，高呼“美国佬从拉丁美洲滚出去！”“枪毙卖国贼”等爱国口号。
    新华社18日讯　据拉丁美洲通讯社报道：一些拉丁美洲国家的人民继续表示支持哈瓦那宣言和古巴革命。
    哥斯达黎加古巴革命之友协会最近组织的一次群众集会把一份表示支持哈瓦那宣言的签名单交给古巴驻哥斯达黎加大使。据报道，仅在一周中，在哥斯达黎加就征集了二万人的签名。
    厄瓜多尔埃苏阿伊省工人联合会在最近发表的一项声明中，表示支持哈瓦那宣言。声明指出，哈瓦那宣言反映了“拉丁美洲各国人民的真正理想和正义而崇高的事业”。在这个省的主要城市库恩卡举行的声援古巴革命的群众大会上，劳动者们还严厉谴责了在圣约瑟举行的美洲国家外长会议通过的决议，特别是美国强加于会议的“圣约瑟宣言”。与会者指出，“圣约瑟宣言”是“违背拉丁美洲人民的真正利益，特别是穷苦阶层和劳动人民的利益的”。大会声明，那些签署这些决议的人“不代表本国人民”。
    巴西的“新闻日报”、“最后一点钟报”、“巴西日报”等报纸最近都发表评论，表示支持古巴把一些企业收归国有和为人民建造住宅的措施。
