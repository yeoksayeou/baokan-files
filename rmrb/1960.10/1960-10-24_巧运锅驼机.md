    Cleverly Transporting the Boiler-Traction Engine

    Not long ago, our automobile central station's transportation and dispatch section had to transport a large boiler-traction engine to Lingqiu County. This machine was large and heavy, and the road to Lingqiu was a mountain road, so it was quite difficult to transport such a large boiler-traction engine.

    Our Deputy Section Chief Liu Xiang called everyone together and held a "Zhuge Liang Meeting" (brainstorming session). Someone said: "Disassemble the boiler-traction engine for transport!" Everyone said it was a good idea. But no one knew how to disassemble it. Liu Xiang thought: Automobile repair workers must be able to disassemble it, but their car repair tasks are also very tight. After the meeting, he consulted with several night shift repair workers who were resting. As soon as they heard it was a matter of supporting agriculture, they quickly helped to disassemble the boiler-traction engine and carefully taught us how to install it.

    The boiler-traction engine was disassembled. Who should be sent to safely transport this big thing to its destination? Comrade Liu Xiang thought of the advanced driver Liu Cunqiang. After discussing it with him, he readily agreed. He carefully checked the car and found a sturdy trailer, and quickly loaded the machine onto the truck.

    Two days later, a phone call came from Lingqiu County, informing us that the boiler-traction engine had been successfully transported and put into agricultural production.

    巧运锅驼机
    不久以前，我们汽车中心站运调股要运一台大型锅驼机到灵丘县去。这台机器身大体重，去灵丘的路又是山路，要想拉运这样大的锅驼机实在有些困难。
    我们的副股长刘祥把大家召集起来，开了个“诸葛亮会”。有人说：“把锅驼机拆开来运！”大家都说这是个好办法。可是都不知道怎样拆。刘祥想：汽车修理工人一定能拆，可是他们的修车任务也很紧。会后，他去同几个正在休息的夜班修理工人商量，大家一听是支援农业的事，就赶紧帮助拆锅驼机，并且细心地教我们如何安装。
    锅驼机拆好了。派谁安全地把这个大玩艺运到目的地呢？刘祥同志想起了先进司机刘存强。跟他一商量，他很干脆地答应下来。他把汽车认真地检查了一遍，又找了一个结实的挂车，很快就把机器装上车去。
    两天后灵丘县来了电话，告诉我们，锅驼机已经顺利运到，并已投入了农业生产。
