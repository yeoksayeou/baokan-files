    Combining Top and Bottom, Emphasizing Both Repair and Manufacturing, Fully Utilizing the Potential of Industries at All Levels
    Jiahe County Rapidly Repairs, Manufactures, and Processes Machinery
    Lingwu County Produces a Three-Purpose Hemp Stripping Machine Using Animal Power, Electricity, and Water Power
    This newspaper Tianjin, 16th: The industrial departments of Jiahe County, Hebei Province, have adopted the method of "combining top and bottom, emphasizing both repair and manufacturing" to rush-produce agricultural and sideline product processing machinery, ensuring the processing needs after the autumn harvest. From the beginning of September to the beginning of October, in just over a month, they have produced more than 2,100 machines, including sweet potato slicers, sweet potato starch machines, cotton stalk peeling machines, power grinders, and shredders. The slicer has already completed its original production task.
    “Combining top and bottom, emphasizing both repair and manufacturing” can fully leverage the potential of county-run factories and commune-run factories and repair stations, enabling the agricultural and sideline product processing machinery production tasks to be completed quickly and well. The county's five county-run agricultural machinery factories are responsible for producing relatively precise and large-scale processing machinery, and are also responsible for researching and trial-producing simple processing machinery with high efficiency, setting up production models for commune-run factories. The 23 iron and wood factories in the communes mainly manufacture simple processing machinery and produce repair parts. The 96 agricultural implement repair stations in the management areas, with the help of more than 200 technicians drawn from the county-run agricultural machinery factory, formed 183 mobile repair teams, carrying tools deep into the production teams, responsible for repairing agricultural and sideline product processing machinery for the production teams, and producing small parts on the spot. In just over a month, all of the county's original more than 4,000 processing machines were repaired and put into production.
    The Jiahe County Party Committee grasped and arranged the production tasks of agricultural and sideline product processing machinery in late August. Party committees at all levels designated a secretary to be responsible for leading this work. Yin Shuying, deputy secretary of the Dianzi Commune Party Committee, went deep into the commune's iron and wood factory and, together with the workers, created a sweet potato starch machine driven by a power machine. This machine combines several processes such as slicing, crushing, sieving, and starch making, and can process 20,000 catties of fresh sweet potatoes per day.
    At present, the county's industrial departments produce a total of fifteen kinds of agricultural and sideline product processing machinery. The production efficiency of these machines is ten to forty times higher than manual labor, which can greatly save labor. For example, a cotton stalk peeling machine can peel 1,200 catties per day, while the highest daily output of manual peeling in the past was only 40 catties; a power grinder for rice milling and flour milling can process 2,000 catties of rice and flour per day, while the daily output of manual or animal-powered grinding in the past was only 100 catties. According to the statistics of more than 2,000 agricultural and sideline product processing machines that have been produced and put into production, by the end of the year, more than 4 million labor days can be saved for the communes.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan: Employees of the Agricultural and Sideline Products Purchasing Station of the Lingwu County Commercial Bureau in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, with the assistance of the Agricultural Implement Research Institute of the Autonomous Region Machinery Bureau and other units, after more than a year and more than 80 revisions, successfully created an animal power, electric power, and water power three-purpose hemp stripping machine, replacing manual hemp stripping.
    As soon as this innovation appeared, it was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of commune members. Agricultural implement factories in various counties and cities sent people to learn from it and actively manufacture and promote it. Up to now, more than 400 units have been manufactured and promoted throughout the autonomous region; the first mechanical hemp stripping factory has also been established in Chongxing Commune, Lingwu County.
    This hemp stripping machine has been proven locally to be able to strip hemp, flax, and various other wild hemp. Its efficiency is very high. In the past, one person could only strip five catties of hemp a day by hand; using the hemp stripping machine to strip hemp with electric power, two people can operate and strip 300 catties in ten hours of work, improving efficiency by 30 times. Using animal power to drive the hemp stripping, one person and one animal can strip 120 catties a day, improving efficiency by 11 times. The hemp stripped by the hemp stripping machine is white, soft, and has long fibers. The quality is high, and the hemp output rate is also 20% higher than manual stripping.
    Since the beginning of September, Chongxing Commune in Lingwu County has promoted electric hemp stripping machines, with an average daily output of 200 to 250 catties of net hemp per machine. The entire commune produced about 800,000 catties of hemp this year, which can be completely stripped in only 80 to 100 days; while the more than 800,000 catties of hemp produced last year were stripped by hand, and although more than 400 commune members were often concentrated, they had not been stripped by the time this year's new hemp was available. According to calculations, after using the hemp stripping machine, this commune can save more than 148,000 labor days a year. After this hemp stripping machine is widely promoted and used in the autonomous region in the future, according to last year's hemp output, 7,000 to 8,000 laborers can be freed from hemp processing work every year, saving more than 2.8 million labor days, and increasing fiber production by about 3 million catties.

    上下结合　修造并重　充分发挥各级工业潜力
    交河县修制加工机械速度快
    灵武县制成畜力电力水力三用剥麻机
    本报天津16日电　河北省交河县工业部门采取“上下结合，修造并重”的方法，突击赶制农副产品加工机械，保证农业秋收后的加工需要。从9月初到10月上旬，一个多月的时间，已经生产出甘薯切片机、甘薯淀粉机、棉秆剥皮机、动力磨、撕碎机等机械两千一百多台。切片机已经完成原订生产任务。
    “上下结合，修造并重”，可以充分发挥县营工厂和社办工厂、修配站的潜力，使农副产品加工机械的生产任务完成得又快又好。全县五个县营农业机械厂负责生产比较精密、大型的加工机械，同时负责研究试制工效高的简易加工机械，为社办工厂树立生产的样板。各公社的二十三个铁木工厂，主要是制造简易加工机械，并且生产修配零件。各管理区的九十六个农具修配站，在县营农业机械厂抽调出的二百多名技术工人的帮助下，组成一百八十三个流动修配组，携带工具深入生产队，负责为生产队修理农副产品加工机械，同时就地生产小零件。一个多月，全县原有的四千多台加工机械就全部修理完毕，投入生产。
    中共交河县委在8月下旬就抓紧安排了农副产品加工机械的生产任务。各级党委都指定一名书记，负责领导这一工作。店子公社党委副书记尹树莺深入公社铁木厂，和工人一起创造出一种用动力机械带动的甘薯淀粉机。这种机械把切丝、粉碎、过筛、制淀粉等几道工序连在一起，每天可加工鲜薯两万斤。
    目前，全县工业部门生产的农副产品加工机械共有十五种。这些机械的生产效率，比人工劳动提高十倍到四十倍以上，可以大大节省劳动力。像棉秆剥皮机，每天可以剥一千二百斤，而过去手工剥制，日产量最高只有四十斤；碾米磨面的动力磨，每天可以加工米面两千斤，而过去用人力推磨或畜力拉磨，日产量不过百斤。根据已生产出并投入生产的二千多台农副产品加工机械的统计，到年底，就可以为各公社节约四百多万个劳动日。
    新华社银川电　宁夏回族自治区灵武县商业局农副产品采购站的职工，在自治区机械局农具研究所等单位协助下，经过一年多的时间和八十多次修改，创制成功一种畜力、电力、水力三用剥麻机，代替了手工剥麻。
    这项革新一出现，立即受到广大社员的热烈欢迎。各县、市农具厂纷纷派人前去学习，积极制造推广。截至目前止，全自治区已制造推广四百多台；第一座机械剥麻厂，也在灵武县崇兴公社建立。
    这种剥麻机经过当地使用证明，能剥大麻、亚麻和其他各种野生麻。它的效率很高。过去手工剥大麻一人一天只能剥五斤；用剥麻机由电力带动剥麻，二人操作，一天工作十小时能剥三百多斤，提高工效三十倍，用畜力带动剥麻，一人一畜一天能剥一百二十斤，提高工效十一倍。用剥麻机剥出的麻，洁白柔软，纤维长，质量高，出麻率也比手工剥麻高20％。
    灵武县崇兴公社从9月初推广电力剥麻机以后，平均每台日产净麻二百至二百五十斤。全社今年共产大麻八十万斤左右，只要八十至一百天就能全部剥完；而去年生产的八十多万斤大麻，用手工剥，虽然经常集中四百多名社员，但是直到今年新麻上场还没有剥完。据计算，使用剥麻机后，这个公社一年可以节约十四万八千多个劳动日。这种剥麻机今后在自治区大量推广使用后，按照去年大麻产量计算，每年能从大麻加工工作中腾出七、八千个劳动力，节约二百八十多万个劳动日，并能增产纤维三百万斤左右。（附图片）
