Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 14th Dispatch: The Cuban Revolutionary Government announced this morning a law nationalizing 382 large enterprises and all private banks in Cuba. The law states that the purpose of this measure is to guarantee the comprehensive development of the national economy through state planning and control of the nation's basic industries.

The law's explanation emphasizes that, despite the expansion of the domestic market, many large enterprises are still undermining production, violating revolutionary laws, and even using ill-gotten gains to support counter-revolutionary groups openly allied with international financial imperialism. The explanation also points out that the existence of large import enterprises solely pursuing profit hinders the new foreign trade policy. This industry should be incentivized to serve economic development, and it is precisely for this purpose that the establishment of a foreign trade bank stipulates state control over imports.

The law also announces that the government will provide practical guarantees for small and medium-sized enterprises and facilitate their normal development. The law points out that the interests of these small and medium-sized enterprises are consistent with the national interest.

Another regulation nationalizing the banks states that, according to the needs of economic planning, issuing currency and distributing loans should be exclusively public functions of the state, and not the work of private enterprises, because they only operate under the stimulation of profit, considering only private interests and disregarding collective interests.

The lending practices of private banks have demonstrated a negative impact on national development: for example, in 1940, 88.7% of all loans were basically provided to sugar enterprises and import trade controlled by U.S. capital, while almost only 0.2% of loans were provided to promote the development of national industry.

These large enterprises and banks that have been announced for nationalization will be transferred to the Cuban state through compulsory confiscation, on the grounds of public interest and social and national interest.

The law supplements the total nationalization of the sugar industry. Prior to this, Cuba had already nationalized thirty-six U.S. sugar mills and is now nationalizing the remaining one hundred and five sugar mills. The law also supplements the nationalization of all banks in Cuba, with the exception of the Bank of Nova Scotia of Canada and the Royal Bank of Canada. American banks have already been nationalized.

The large enterprises announced for nationalization today include railways, metallurgy, power generation, shipping, chemicals, manufacturing, textiles, paper making, construction, film, and various sectors closely related to people's lives. Some of these large enterprises belong to U.S. capital.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 14th Dispatch: The Cuban people joyfully expressed their firm support for the revolutionary government's measure announced this morning to nationalize Cuba's private large enterprises and banks.

The Cuban Workers' Confederation, representing the working class, congratulated this measure and stated that the Cuban people, united around the revolutionary government, are determined never to retreat and move forward until we thoroughly achieve the profound social reforms that guarantee the future and happiness of our people.

The Cuban Workers' Confederation called on the militia to persistently guard the nationalized large enterprises and called for increased production in these enterprises.

The Chemical Industry Workers' Confederation pointed out that the nationalization measure is a "fatal blow to U.S. imperialism and all reactionary and treacherous entrepreneurs who attempt to obstruct the unstoppable advance of our revolution."

The National Workers' Confederation of Animal Husbandry, Slaughtering, and Other Related Industries solemnly vowed to do its utmost to maintain a high level of production in the industries that have already been nationalized.

At the same time, mass rallies were held throughout Havana tonight in a very enthusiastic atmosphere in support of the nationalization measures, with attendees chanting slogans such as "Cuba yes, Yankees no" and "We will win."

Newspaper editorial departments are constantly receiving hundreds of letters expressing support.

    保证国家经济的全面发展　打击美帝国主义和反动的大企业主
    古巴政府宣布大企业国有化法律
    工人决心增加生产　哈瓦那举行庆祝集会
    据新华社哈瓦那14日电　古巴革命政府今天清晨宣布了把三百八十二家大企业和全部在古巴的私营银行收归国有的法律，这项法律说明，采取这一措施的目的是为了通过国家对全国的基础工业的计划和控制，保证国家经济的全面发展。
    法律说明强调指出，尽管国内市场扩大了，但许多大企业仍破坏生产，违反革命法律，甚至用以恶劣方式取来的钱支持公然同国际金融帝国主义结成联盟的反革命集团。这项说明还指出，一味追求利润的大进口企业的存在阻碍着新的对外贸易政策，应该奖励这一行业为经济发展效力，正是为了这个目的，在建立对外贸易银行时，规定了国家控制进口。
    这项法律同时宣布，政府将为中小企业提供实际保证，并为它们正常的发展提供方便。法律指出，这些中小企业的利益同国家利益是一致的。
    另一项规定把银行收归国有的法律说，根据经济计划的需要，发行货币和分配贷款应该是专门属于国家的公共职能，不应该是那些私人企业的工作，因为它们只是在利润刺激下活动，它们只考虑私人利益，而不顾集体利益。
    私营银行发放贷款的情况表明了对国家发展的消极作用：如1940年全部贷款中的88.7％基本上提供给了由美资控制的糖业企业和进口贸易。而在促进民族工业的发展方面几乎只提供了0.2％的贷款。
    这些被宣布收归国有的大企业和银行将通过强力征收的手段转归古巴国家所有，收归国有的理由是为公共利益及社会和国家利益。
    这项法律补充规定把食糖工业全部国有化。在这以前，古巴已经把三十六家美国糖厂收归国有，现在正把一百零五家余下的糖厂收归国有。法律同样还补充规定把所有在古巴的银行收归国有，但有例外——加拿大诺瓦埃斯科蒂亚银行和加拿大皇家银行不收归国有。美国银行已经收归国有了。
    今天宣布被收归国有的包括了铁路、冶金、发电、海运、化学品、制造、纺织、造纸、建筑、电影以及与人民生活有密切关系的各部门的大企业。这些大企业中，有些是属于美国资本的。
    据新华社哈瓦那14日电　古巴人民兴高采烈地表示坚决支持革命政府今天清晨宣布的把古巴的私营大企业和银行收归国有的措施。
    古巴工人联合会代表工人阶级祝贺这一措施，并且表示，团结在革命政府周围的古巴全国人民决心永不后退，向前迈进，直到我们彻底实现保证我国人民的未来和幸福的深刻的社会改革为止。
    古巴工人联合会号召民兵坚持不懈地守卫被收归国有的大企业，并号召在这些企业里增加生产。
    化学工业工人联合会指出，国有化措施是“对美帝国主义和一切企图阻碍我国革命不可遏止地前进的反动和谋叛的企业主的致命打击”。
    畜牧业、屠宰业及其他有关工业的全国工人联合会庄严宣誓，将尽最大的力量在已经收归国有的工业中保持高额生产水平。
    与此同时，哈瓦那各地今天晚上在支持国有化措施的非常热烈的气氛中举行了群众集会，到会者高呼“要古巴，不要美国佬”、“我们必胜”的口号。
    各报编辑部不断收到表示支持的数以百计的信件。
