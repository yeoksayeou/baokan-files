Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 13th (TASS dispatch) The Soviet proposal on disarmament and the situation arising from the implementation of the United Nations General Assembly resolution on this issue adopted on November 20, 1959.

The General Assembly,

	Aware that the continuing arms race, under conditions where modern weapons possess unlimited destructive power and range, harbors enormous dangers for the peoples of all countries;

	Convinced that the problem of general and complete disarmament, in view of the danger of rocket-nuclear war, is the most important and pressing issue of our time;

	Reaffirming the United Nations General Assembly resolution of November 20, 1959, on general and complete disarmament;

	Regretting that the aforementioned resolution has not yet been implemented, and that necessary measures have not yet been taken to implement it,

	Specifically reiterates its call to the governments of all countries to exert every effort to strive for a constructive solution to the problem of general and complete disarmament, and recommends that a disarmament treaty be drafted and concluded as quickly as possible in line with the following principles:

	General and complete disarmament should include: disbanding all armed forces, destroying all armaments, ceasing military production, dismantling all foreign bases on the territories of other countries, prohibiting nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, bacteriological weapons, and rocket weapons, ceasing the production of such weapons and destroying stockpiles of such weapons and the means of delivering such weapons, abolishing all national institutions for military organization, prohibiting military training, and ceasing military expenditures;

	General and complete disarmament should be realized within a prescribed period, in stages, and in accordance with an agreed sequence;

	Disarmament measures with regard to nuclear weapons and conventional armaments should be balanced in such a way that no one state or group of states can obtain a military advantage and that the security of all states is equally guaranteed;

	The measures stipulated in the program for general and complete disarmament shall be implemented from start to finish under international supervision, the scope of supervision to be commensurate with the scope and nature of the disarmament measures implemented at each stage. In order to implement supervision and inspection of disarmament, an international supervisory organization shall be established within the framework of the United Nations, with the participation of all countries;

	After the realization of general and complete disarmament, necessary measures should be taken in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security, including the undertaking of obligations by states to place at the disposal of the Security Council contingents composed of police (militia) personnel remaining in the various countries to maintain internal order and protect the personal safety of citizens, as necessary;

	In order to build trust and eliminate the possibility of using international police forces to benefit this or that country, or a group of countries, in the rational use of international police forces, it is considered necessary to reorganize the structure of the United Nations Secretariat and the Security Council, so that all three groups of countries (socialist countries, countries joining the Western countries group, and neutral countries) have equal representation in these institutions.

The Soviet government's proposal on "Basic Provisions of General and Complete Disarmament" and other proposals on this issue are submitted together to the Disarmament Committee for discussion, in order to draft a treaty on general and complete disarmament, including an international supervision and inspection system to guarantee the strict implementation of the treaty.

    关于裁军和由于执行联大1959年11月20日决议而形成的局势
    苏联政府提交联大政委会的建议
    新华社14日讯　塔斯社纽约13日电　苏联关于裁军和由于执行1959年11月20日联合国大会就这个问题通过的决议而形成的局势的建议。
    大会，
    意识到，在现代化武器具有无限的破坏力和射程的条件下，继续进行军备竞赛对各国人民孕育着巨大的危险；
    确信，由于火箭—核战争的危险，全面彻底裁军的问题乃是迫待解决的当代最重要的问题；
    重申联合国大会第十四届会议1959年11月20日关于全面彻底裁军的决议；
    遗憾地指出，上述决议迄今没有执行，迄今还没有采取必要的措施来贯彻这项决议，
    特再次呼吁各国政府尽一切努力争取建设性地解决全面彻底裁军问题，并建议根据下列原则尽快地草拟和缔结这样的裁军条约：
    全面彻底裁军应当包括：解散一切武装部队、销毁一切军备、停止军事生产、撤除在别国领土上的一切外国基地、禁止核武器、化学武器、细菌武器和火箭武器，停止这种武器的生产并销毁贮存的这种武器以及这种武器的运载工具、撤消各国用于组织军事的各种机构、禁止军事训练、停止军费开支；
    全面彻底裁军应在规定的期限内、分阶段、根据商定的顺序实现；
    有关核武器和常规军备方面的裁军措施应该作这样的平衡，即任何一个国家或国家集团都不能取得军事优势，并使一切国家的安全得到同样程度的保障；
    全面彻底裁军纲领规定的措施自始至终在国际监督下执行，监督的范围应符合每个阶段执行的裁军措施的范围和性质。为实现对裁军的监督和视察，在联合国范围内成立一个有各国参加的国际监督组织；
    在全面彻底裁军实现后应根据联合国宪章采取必要的措施来维护国际和平和安全，其中包括各国承担义务：在必要时由各国留下来维持国内秩序和保护公民个人安全的警察（民警）人员组成部队交付安理会支配；
    为了在合理使用国际警察部队方面建立信任和排除把它们用来为这个或那个国家，或某个国家集团谋利益的可能性，认为有必要改组联合国秘书处和安全理事会的结构，从而使所有三个国家集团（社会主义国家、加入西方国家集团的国家和中立国家）在这些机构里都有均等的代表权。
    苏联政府关于“全面彻底裁军基本条款”的建议以及关于这个问题的其他建议一并提交裁军委员会讨论，以便草拟全面彻底裁军条约，其中包括保证严格执行条约的国际监督和视察制度。
