Xinhua News Agency, 26th -- Factories belonging to the urban people's communes in Beijing are extensively mobilizing the masses to improve product quality, strive to eliminate defective products, and launch an increase production and practice economy campaign.

The product quality of many factories in the urban people's communes of Beijing has improved to varying degrees compared to the early days of their establishment. According to a recent analysis by the Beijing Commercial Department of 161 kinds of products from urban people's communes, the quality of over 91% of them is stable or improved. The "July 1st" Hat Factory of the Fusui Jing People's Commune produced 220,000 hats this year, and none of them were returned for repairs. The trouser hooks produced by the Hardware Processing Factory of the Chaoyangmen People's Commune were rated as first-class products in the city, and the factory's trouser hooks account for half of the city's sales volume. The pen nibs processed by the Beixinqiao People's Commune for the Beijing Xinhua Rubber Factory, the wire rakes produced by the Jingshan People's Commune, and the plastering trowels produced by the Tiantan People's Commune for the construction sector, have all reached or approached the level of advanced products in the city.

Currently, all commune-run factories in the city are taking the improvement of product quality as an important part of carrying out the increase production and practice economy campaign. Chongwen District organized quality inspection teams and quality experience exchange meetings by industry, and under the leadership of leading cadres, they were divided into seven working groups to conduct in-depth inspections of various factories; relevant cadres in other districts also went to commune-run factories and worked with the masses to vigorously improve product quality. Many factories mobilized the masses to speak out freely and conduct debates on the political and economic significance of improving product quality, and held quality comparison exhibitions to publicize opinions solicited from commercial departments and large factories. In this way, the majority of production personnel realized the significance of improving product quality and carrying out the increase production and practice economy campaign. The Xiaowujin Factory of the Longtan People's Commune, which produces plastering trowels and other products, invited construction workers to report on the significance of the quality of plastering trowels for capital construction at the discussion meeting. Now, all of the factory's products are qualified. The factories of the Fengsheng People's Commune in Xicheng District posted 1,600 big-character posters to debate the issue of whether product quality can be further improved. The shoe factory of this commune has been rated as a first-class product by the Municipal Light Industry Bureau. After discussion, everyone believed that there are still many areas that need improvement compared with the same products of large factories.

Many commune-run factories are taking various measures to improve the technical level of production personnel based on the problems found in the product quality inspection. Some commune-run factories that have ties with large factories almost all have workers from large factories working in the factory as technical guidance. Chongwen District recently sent more than 300 workers and cadres to help commune factories improve their technical level. Many factories also organize experienced workers and technicians in the factory to give technical lessons to everyone. The Dashilan Motor Factory in Xuanwu District has adopted the learning method of apprentices learning from masters and cultivating key personnel to drive the general population, so that all production personnel in the factory are relatively proficient in mastering production technology.

Many commune-run factories have also strengthened the product quality management system. Chongwen District recently inspected 39 kinds of products from commune-run factories, of which 36 kinds of products have established a quality inspection system, and quality standards have been stipulated using articles and samples. In addition to having special personnel responsible for inspecting quality, many factories have established a three-level inspection system of production personnel, group leaders, and workshop inspectors to ensure that everyone is responsible and that there are checks at every level.

    提高产品质量力争消灭次品
    北京城市公社工厂不断提高技术水平
    新华社26日讯　北京各城市人民公社所属工厂正在广泛发动群众提高产品质量，力争消灭次品，开展增产节约运动。
    北京各城市人民公社许多工厂的产品质量，比办社初期已经有了不同程度的提高。据北京市商业部门最近对城市人民公社一百六十一种产品的分析，质量稳定或提高的占91％以上。福绥境人民公社“七一”制帽厂今年出厂的二十二万顶帽子，没有一顶返修。朝阳门人民公社五金加工厂生产的裤钩，被评为市的一级产品，这个厂生产的裤钩占全市销售量的一半。北新桥人民公社为北京新华橡胶厂加工的钢笔笔胆，景山人民公社生产的铁丝爪篱，天坛人民公社为建筑部门生产的泥灰抹子等产品，都达到或接近市内先进产品的水平。
    现在，全市各社办工厂都把提高产品质量作为开展增产节约运动的一项重要内容。崇文区按行业组织了质量检查团和质量经验交流会，并在领导干部的带领下，分成七个工作组深入各厂进行检查；其他各区的有关干部，也都分头到社办工厂和群众一起大抓产品质量。许多工厂发动群众大鸣大放，开展了关于提高产品质量的政治意义和经济意义的辩论，并且举办质量对比展览会，公布从商业部门和大工厂征求来的意见。这样，就使广大生产人员认识到提高产品质量和开展增产节约运动的意义。生产泥灰抹子等产品的龙潭人民公社小五金厂，在讨论会上请建筑工人报告泥灰抹子质量好坏对基本建设的意义后，这个厂的产品现已全部合格。西城区丰盛人民公社所属各厂贴出了一千六百张大字报，来辩论能否进一步提高产品质量的问题。这个公社制鞋厂的产品已被市轻工业局评为一级品，经过辩论，大家认为和大工厂的相同产品比较，还有许多地方需要改进。
    许多社办工厂根据检查产品质量中发现的问题，正在采取各种措施提高生产人员的技术水平。一些和大工厂有挂钩关系的社办工厂，几乎都有大工厂工人在厂里当技术指导。崇文区的大工厂最近就派了三百多名工人、干部，帮助公社工厂提高技术水平。许多工厂还组织厂内的老师傅和技术员给大家讲技术课。宣武区大栅栏电机厂采取师傅带徒弟、培养重点带动一般的学习办法，使全厂的生产人员都比较熟练地掌握了生产技术。
    许多社办工厂还加强了产品质量管理制度。崇文区最近检查了三十九种社办工厂的产品，其中三十六种产品已经建立了质量检验制度，并且用条文、样板规定了质量标准。许多工厂除了有专人负责检验质量外，并建立了生产人员、小组长、车间检验员的三级检查制度，做到处处有人负责，层层有人把关。（附图片）
