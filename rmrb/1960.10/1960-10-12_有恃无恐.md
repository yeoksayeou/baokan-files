    Fearless Because of Reliance
    Yu Yang
    The Cold Dew has already passed, and in another ten days, the Frost's Descent will closely follow. Nature, with the changing seasons, begins to move towards the silver winter.
    Winter is the last season of the year, and also the busiest and most decisive season for production. In this season, due to the drop in temperature, ice, frost, and snow often bring some difficulties to production. To ensure a greater increase in production in the fourth quarter and win an "all-around red" for the whole year, it is necessary to seize the time and make preparations for insulation and winterization as early as possible.
    "Do not rely on the enemy not coming, but rely on having the means to await them," this is an important experience for military victory. Chairman Mao often said: Do not fight unprepared battles, and do not have a侥倖(jiao xing) mentality about the victory of the battle. All of this refers to fully foreseeing all the problems that may occur and be encountered in the battle, making preparations in advance, and putting oneself in an active position. The same is true for production. If preparations are made early, well, and comprehensively, it will prevent adverse factors that may be encountered in production in advance, creating conditions for overall victory. Making early preparations for cold protection and winterization is an important measure to put winter production in an active position. If preparations are made early, we will not be afraid of sudden cold waves, and we can achieve safe production despite ice and snow. If the preparatory work is done early, manpower, materials, and time can be arranged more properly, which will not only affect normal production but also make the cold protection work more detailed and thorough. The weather is already getting cold, and the frontier regions have already had snow more than a foot deep. Industrial and transportation enterprises in the north should seize the opportunity to promptly allocate some manpower to carry out production preparations for cold protection and winterization.
    How to do a good job in cold protection and winterization preparation? Today's group of cold protection news published in this newspaper provides some useful experience. First of all, it is necessary to carry out winter cold protection production inspections, add insulation protection equipment to equipment that is prone to cold and freezing in advance, organize manpower, and step up the manufacture of various cold protection equipment and the implementation of cold protection projects, and be sure to complete them all before the cold wave arrives. Secondly, it is necessary to do a good job in the storage of raw materials and other materials for winter. At the same time, mobilizing the masses to carry out technical innovations and technical revolutions in cold and frost prevention is also a very important thing. The technical performance competition of encircling and suppressing the "cold protection and winterization barrier" launched by Anshan Iron and Steel Company has achieved very good results. Focusing only on winter transportation, the masses put forward more than 1,500 innovation proposals, made more than 30 kinds of thawing tools, and summed up advanced experiences such as "blasting and thawing" and "steam thawing." Obviously, with strict winter protection measures and equipment, and with these advanced experiences in winter operations, it will powerfully guarantee the continued leap forward in winter production this year.

    有恃无恐
    于羊
    寒露已经过去了，再过十天，霜降就紧跟着到来。大自然随着节令的更替，开始迈步向着银色的冬季走去。
    冬季是一年中最后的一季，也是生产上最繁忙和有决战意义的一季。在这个季节里，由于气温下降，冰冻和风雪往往要给生产带来一些困难。要保证第四季度实现更大幅度的增产，赢得全年“满堂红”，就必须及早地抓紧进行保温过冬的准备工作。
    “不恃敌之不来，恃吾有以待”，这是兵家致胜的重要经验。毛主席经常说：不要打无准备的仗，不要对战斗的胜利抱着侥幸的心理，都是指的要充分预见战斗中可能发生和遇见的一切问题，事先作好准备，使自己处于主动的地位。打仗如此，生产也是如此。准备工作做得早，做得好，做得全面，就事先防止了生产中可能遇到的不利因素，为全盘胜利创造了条件。提早做好防寒过冬的准备工作，是使冬季生产处于主动地位的重要措施。准备得早，就不怕寒流的突然袭击，做到任它冰封雪飘，我自安然生产。准备工作做得早，在人力、物力和时间上，也可以做到更妥善地安排，既不影响正常生产，又可以把防寒工作做得更加细致周到。现在天气已经冷起来了，塞外地区已经下过了盈尺的雪。北方的各个工业和交通运输企业都应当抓紧时机，及时抽出一部分人力进行防寒过冬的生产准备。
    怎样做好防寒过冬准备工作？今天本报发表的一组防寒新闻中提供了一些有益的经验。首先，要进行过冬防寒生产检查，把容易受寒受冻的设备提早加上保温防护设备，组织人力，加紧各种防寒设备的制造和防寒工程的进行，务必赶在寒潮到来以前全部完成。再就是要做好冬季原材料及其它物资的储备工作。与此同时，发动群众，大搞防寒防冻的技术革新和技术革命，也是一件很重要的事。鞍山钢铁公司展开的围攻“防寒过冬关”的技术表演赛就收到了很好的效果。仅仅围绕冬季运输，群众就提出了一千五百多项革新建议，制成了三十多种解冻工具，并且总结出了“爆破解冻”、“蒸汽解冻”等先进经验。显然，有严密的越冬防护措施和设备，又有了这些冬季作业的先进经验，必将有力地保证今年冬季生产的继续跃进。
