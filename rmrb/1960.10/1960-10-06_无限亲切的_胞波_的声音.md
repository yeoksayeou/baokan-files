Our Burmese friends say that this year is the "Sino-Burmese Friendship Year." The visit and performance of the Burmese Cultural Delegation to China can be said to be a grand event in the cultural activities of the "Sino-Burmese Friendship Year." The first performance of the Burmese Cultural Delegation at the Great Hall of the People in the capital expressed the deep friendship of the Burmese people towards the Chinese people, and also demonstrated the long-standing traditional national art of the Burmese people and the great development that this excellent traditional art has achieved in recent years.

The first performance of the Burmese Cultural Delegation was filled with a joyous and festive atmosphere. The performance began with the "Myanmar-China Friendship Song" composed by Burmese composers and the "Sino-Burmese Friendship Song" written by Chinese composers. We heard that beautiful, affectionate word: "Pauk-Phaw." The moving melody sang of this historical friendship and precious new friendship.

China and Burma have had commercial and cultural exchanges as early as 200 BC, so it is no wonder that when we hear Burmese music, we have an extraordinary sense of intimacy. We know that Burma still uses five-tone, six-tone, and seven-tone scales, which is so similar to our musical system! When we listen to the singing in modern pas de deux and small singing programs, we will find that the lyrics are based on either five-character or seven-character verses. When necessary developments are made, they become ten syllables per sentence, which is so similar to the ancient Chinese poetry form! Therefore, in these beautiful music and poems, we truly heard the voice of "Pauk-Phaw"—the voice of relatives.

We can see the kinship between our "suona" and the Burmese instrument called "na" in the Burmese instrumental music with its strong and unique national style. This instrument, which accompanies singing and plays the main melody in the band, reminds us of the scene in ancient northern China where "suona" and "guan" were used to accompany singing. Even today, when our Peking Opera performs programs such as "Havoc in Heaven," which were transferred from Kunqu Opera to Peking Opera, such as when Li Tianwang orders troops, he still uses "suona" to accompany the singing of "Dian Jiang Chun." I don't want to investigate the ins and outs of these historical cultural exchanges. I just want to say that all of this shows how close the people of China and Burma are in many aspects! When we hear the earth-shattering "Ba Ma" drums, when we hear the crisp and melodious "Mong Shain" (a set of copper gongs that can be knocked out of a scale - like a gong, surrounded by a circle and played by one person, which can be translated as circle gongs) and the rhythmically complex "San Win"—perhaps it can be translated as circle drums ("San" in Burmese means "circle", Win means drum, and Mong means gong), we think that these instruments were introduced into China as "Piao Music" as early as the Tang Dynasty. These instruments, with their unique timbre and varied rhythms, demonstrate a huge expressive power, not only providing a rhythmic basis for the dancers' movements, but also often interpreting the dancers' movements and emotions with their rich expressions.

Burmese dance is known for its unique movements of the feet, waist, head, and hands. Students from the Mandalay Art School performed the basic movements of this classical dance, while excellent young dancers Nai Nai San and Kyaw Win Tin performed modern pas de deux developed from classical dance. The meaning of the name of the dancer Nai Nai San is "willow in the wind," which is the best portrayal of the beautiful dance. What is more worthy of special mention is that the dance drama, based on the action principles of classical dance, not only expresses mythological traditional themes such as "Shanda Jingnaye," but also expresses modern themes such as "The Story of the Irrawaddy River." It is also worth learning from us to be able to obtain such a harmonious effect by using the action principles of classical dance to express such modern themes. The Burmese film artists' performance of "The Eagle and the Chick" and the Jingpo ethnic folk dance illustrate that only in countries that have gained national independence is it possible to value and develop their own folk art.

What particularly touched us was the Chinese dance and music program "Weaving Girl" and the solo of Chinese songs performed by our Burmese friends, which concretely demonstrated the Burmese people's love for our art. It is no wonder that these programs won thunderous applause. The soloist Wu Anji affectionately explained the content of our songs "The Sun Never Sets on the Grassland" and "Ode to the Motherland" and other songs, and he sang these songs with the sincere temperament and real emotions unique to a non-professional singer.

The final chorus was a moving scene. The Burmese friends' colorful costumes were like peacocks with their tails spread. The song "Song of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty," created by Burmese friends in Beijing, movingly praises the completion of the new magnificent building of friendship built by the people of China and Burma on the basis of traditional friendship!

    无限亲切的“胞波”的声音
    赵沨
    缅甸朋友们说今年是“中缅友好年”，缅甸文化代表团访华演出，可以说是“中缅友好年”的文化活动中的盛事。缅甸文化代表团在首都人民大会堂举行的首次演出，表达了缅甸人民对中国人民深厚友谊，也展示了缅甸人民具有悠久传统的民族艺术和这个优秀的传统艺术在近年来所获得的巨大的发展。
    缅甸文化代表团的首次演出，洋溢着一片喜气洋洋的节日气氛。演出是以缅甸作曲家创作的《缅中友好歌》和我国作曲家写作的《中缅友谊之歌》开始的，我们听到了那个美丽、亲切的字：“胞波”，动人的音调歌唱着这种历史的友谊和可贵的新的友情。
    中缅两国远在公元前二百年就有了商业和文化往来，无怪乎当我们听到缅甸音乐时，便有一种异常的亲切之感。我们知道，缅甸至今用着五声音阶、六声音阶和七声音阶，这和我国的乐制是何等的相似！当我们倾听现代双人舞和小演唱等节目中的歌唱时，我们会发现歌词中或以五言体或以七音体为基础，在作必要的发展时，又变成了十个音节一句，这和我国的古代诗歌形式又是何等的相近！所以，我们在这些美丽的音乐和诗歌中，真正地听到了“胞波”的声音——亲戚的声音。
    具有着强烈、独特的民族风格的缅甸器乐音乐，我们从叫做“呐”的乐器上，可以看到我国的“唢呐”和“呐”之间的亲戚关系。这个在乐队中伴奏歌唱、演奏主旋律的乐器，使我们想到古代北方中国用
  “唢呐”和“管”来伴唱的情景，至今，我国京剧演出《闹天宫》一类从昆曲转入京剧的节目时，如李天王点将时唱“点绛唇”还是用“唢呐”来伴唱的。我不想来考证这些历史上的文化来往的来龙去脉，我只想说所有这些都说明了中缅两国人民之间在许多方面都是何等的亲近！当我们听到声震四座的“巴玛”大鼓时，当我们听到清脆动听的“孟珊”（可以敲出音阶的一套铜?——像铜锣的乐器，围成一个圈子由一个人演奏，可以译作圈锣）和节奏繁复的“珊温”——也许可以译作圈鼓（“珊”在缅文是“圈”的意思，温是鼓，孟是锣），我们便想到这些乐器远在唐代被称为“骠国乐”传入中国的就是这种音乐。这些乐器以其独有音色，借着多变的节奏展示了巨大的表现力量，不仅为舞蹈家的动作提供了节奏基础，而且时常以其丰富的表情解释着舞蹈家的动作和感情。
    缅甸舞蹈以其特有的脚、腰、头和手的动作著称，曼德勒艺术学校的学生们表演了这种古典舞蹈的基本动作，而优秀的青年舞蹈家内内山和觉温丁等表演了根据古典舞发展出来的现代双人舞。舞蹈家内内山的名字的意思是“风中杨柳”，这正是这个舞蹈的美丽的舞姿的最好的写照。更值得特别提出的是，在基础于古典舞的动作原则之上的舞剧，不仅表现了神话传统的题材像《珊达京娜意》，也表现了现代题材的《伊洛瓦底江的故事》，用古典舞的动作原则来表现这样的现代题材，能获得如此谐和的效果也是值得我们借鉴的。缅甸电影艺术家们表演的《老鹰和小鸡》和景颇族民间舞，说明了只有在获得民族独立的国家才有可能重视和发展自己的民间艺术。
    令我们特别感动的是缅甸的朋友表演的中国舞蹈和音乐节目《织网姑娘》和中国歌曲的独唱，具体地表现了缅甸人民对我国艺术的热爱，无怪乎这些节目都博得雷动的欢呼。独唱者吴安基深情地解释了我国歌曲《草原上升起不落的太阳》和《歌唱祖国》等歌曲的内容，他以一种非职业的歌唱所特有的诚挚的气质和真实的感情演唱了这些歌曲。
    终场的大合唱是一个动人的场面，缅甸朋友的五色缤纷的服装真像是开了屏的孔雀。缅甸朋友们在北京创作的歌曲《中缅边界条约之歌》动人地歌颂了中缅两国人民在传统友谊的基础上建筑起来的新的辉煌的友好大厦的落成！
