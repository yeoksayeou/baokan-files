    The Ideals of the Martyrs Must Be Realized
    -- Reflections on Reading “The Life of Struggle of Fang Zhimin”
    Shen Shuangyu
    I love to read the true revolutionary stories written by revolutionary predecessors themselves and their relatives and friends. Like Comrade Wu Yunduo's "Everything Dedicated to the Party," Comrade Gao Yubao's "Gao Yubao," and so on. I have also read "Lovely China" and "Notes from Prison," so I have a deep impression of Martyr Fang Zhimin. Therefore, when I saw the book "The Life of Struggle of Fang Zhimin," I was truly overjoyed. After reading the postscript, I learned that the author, Miao Min, was Comrade Fang Zhimin's wife. Encouraged by Chairman Mao's inscription, she collected materials from Comrade Fang Zhimin's mother, elder sister, classmates, comrades-in-arms, and some of Fang Zhimin's own writings to write this book, which attracted me even more.
    This book is truly touching, not only because Comrade Miao Min writes sincerely and movingly, but more importantly, the deeds that demonstrate Comrade Fang Zhimin's great revolutionary spirit profoundly educate us.
    Comrade Fang Zhimin is one of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. In order to save the motherland and liberate the nation, he did not hesitate to sacrifice everything. Therefore, he possessed the fearless spirit of not being afraid of hardships and acting bravely for a just cause. For the sake of the revolution, he never cared about his position. If he was needed in the province, he would stay in the province; if he couldn't work in the province, he would go to the county; if the county didn't work, he would go to the village. Anyway, wherever he went, there was revolution. He was truly a person who was never arrogant in victory and never discouraged in defeat. When he was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Party, when he was elected as one of the chairmen of the Central Workers' and Peasants' Government, when the Central Committee awarded him the Red Star Medal and awarded his work unit – the Red Tenth Army – a banner, he did not feel that these were personal achievements at all, but only said: "The creation of this Soviet area is clearly due to the hard work of the workers and peasants of the entire province and all the Red Army soldiers, and the strong and correct leadership of the Communist Party, especially the strong leadership since the establishment of the Central Soviet Government in 1931." However, when he led the Red Army to fight a decisive battle with an enemy seven times our size, and our forces dwindled from two thousand to just over eighty people, he was not discouraged, but still thought: "...Because of this failure, should we be pessimistic and stop working? No, we must continue to work! If the team fails this time, we can still recover quickly with half a year or a year of hard work. What is there to fear! What is there to be pessimistic about! We must always keep in mind this bloody lesson, work hard, and work day and night! We are not afraid of not succeeding!" He was truly a man who could not be subdued by force! After the Kuomintang bandit army captured Comrade Fang Zhimin, it was like they had obtained a priceless treasure, and they thought of holding so-called "celebration meetings" everywhere to show their power. They did not expect that they were preparing a platform for Comrade Fang Zhimin everywhere, allowing Comrade Fang Zhimin to promote the war of resistance against Japan and save the country, and to promote communism. Not only were countless Kuomintang officials turned away when they tried to "persuade him to surrender," but even the old thief Chiang Kai-shek specially took his private secretary from Wuhan by plane to Nanchang to see him, but he still said: "Thank you, Mr. Chiang, my life is only thirty-six years old, you should quickly order the execution." He felt that his life and death were not for anything else, but for saving the country and for the great cause of communism. In one of his manuscripts, he wrote: "We are Communists, and of course we all hold a positive and struggling view of life, and we are by no means misanthropes... and we are willing to escape prison and work for the Party again. But we are by no means people who steal life and fear death. We live for the revolution and are willing to die for the revolution! Now that we have no way to live and can only die to thank the Party, we are all determined to die for the cause." The reason why he did this was precisely because he had a great ideal: to make China such a land: "...Everywhere is a lively creation, everywhere is a progress that changes with each passing day, joyful songs will replace sighs, smiling faces will replace bitter faces, prosperity will replace poverty, health will replace disease, wisdom will replace ignorance, friendship will replace hatred, and the joy of life will replace the sorrow of death, and a bright and beautiful garden will replace the desolate wasteland..." Because he firmly believed that "such a glorious day is definitely not in the distant future, but in the very near future."
    Comrade Fang Zhimin is one of the Party's most loyal and bravest fighters. Comrade Fang Zhimin is not dead, his lofty ideals and his fighting spirit will always live in our hearts! He could work for the Party and serve the nation regardless of life and death. In such difficult years, he could work hard for the complete liberation of mankind – the great cause of communism. Why can't we devote ourselves to the cause of socialism and communism in these wonderful days today? We can! We can! We certainly can! Otherwise, we would be letting down the martyrs! The ideals of the martyrs, we must fulfill! We must fulfill them! And we are fulfilling them!

    先烈们的理想一定要实现
    ——读《方志敏战斗的一生》有感
    申双鱼
    我很爱看革命前辈们自己和他们的亲友所写的真实的革命故事。像吴运铎同志写的《把一切献给党》，高玉宝同志写的《高玉宝》等等。我也看过《可爱的中国》和《狱中纪实》，因此，对方志敏烈士的印象也很深。所以一见《方志敏战斗的一生》这本书以后，真是如获至宝。看过后记，知道作者缪敏是方志敏同志的爱人。她是受了毛主席亲笔题词的鼓励，从方志敏同志的母亲、胞姐、同学、战友等方面以及方志敏同志自己写的一些文稿中搜集了材料写成的，这就更吸引了我。
    这本书实在使人感动，不只是缪敏同志写的真切动人，而更主要的是表现了方志敏同志的伟大革命精神的事迹是那样深刻地教育着我们。
    方志敏同志是中华民族优秀儿女行列中的一个。他为了拯救祖国，为了解放民族，不惜牺牲自己的一切。因此，他也就有了不怕艰险，见义勇为的大无畏精神。他为了革命，从不讲究职位，省里需要就在省里，省里不能活动到县里，县里不行到村里，反正是他到哪里革命在哪里。他真是个胜利不骄傲，失败不灰心的人。当他当选了党的中央委员，当选为中央工农政府主席之一的时候，当中央授给他红星勋章，授给他工作单位——红十军奖旗的时候，他都丝毫没有感到这是个人的成绩，而只是说：“这一苏区的创造，很显明的是由于全省工农群众与全体红色战士艰苦奋斗与共产党坚强正确的领导，尤其是自1931年中央苏维埃政府成立后有力的领导的结果”。然而，当他率领着红军和七倍于我的敌军决战，我军人员由两军人战斗到只剩下八十多人的时候，他并不灰心，仍是想：“……这次遭了失败，就悲观不干了吗？不，还是要干！这次队伍失败了，凭着我们半年一年的努力，仍是很快可以恢复起来的。怕什么！悲观什么！总要紧紧记着这次血的教训，努力地干，废寝忘餐地干！不怕不成功的！”他真是个威武不屈的人！国民党匪军捉到方志敏同志以后，真像得到了无价之宝，想到处开所谓“庆祝会”，以显示他们的威风。没想到却到处给方志敏同志准备了讲坛，让方志敏同志宣传了抗日救国，宣传了共产主义。不只是多少个国民党官吏去“劝降”都受了碰，就是蒋介石老贼专门带上私人秘书由武汉坐上飞机到南昌去见他，他仍是说：“谢谢蒋先生，我的生命只有三十六岁，你赶快下令执行吧。”他觉得自己的生和死，都不是为了别的，都是为了救国，为了伟大的共产主义事业。他在一篇文稿中写道：“我们是共产党员，当然都抱着积极的奋斗的人生观，绝不是厌世主义者……，而且愿意得脱牢狱，再为党工作。但是我们绝不是偷生怕死的人，我们为革命而生，愿为革命而死！到现在无法得生，只有一死谢党的时候，我们就都下决心就义。”他所以要这样做，正是因为他有伟大的理想：要让中国成为这样的一块土地：“……到处都是活跃跃的创造，到处都是日新月异的进步，欢歌将代替了悲叹，笑脸将代替了苦脸，富裕将代替了贫穷，康健将代替了疾苦，智慧将代替了愚昧，友爱将代替了仇杀，生之快乐将代替了死之悲哀，明媚的花园将代替了凄凉的荒地……”。因为他坚信“这么光荣的一天，决不在辽远的将来，而在很近的将来”。
    方志敏同志是党最忠实、最勇敢的战士之一。方志敏同志没有死，他的崇高理想、他的战斗精神，将永远活在我们的心里！他能够不顾生死地为党出力，为民族效劳，他在那样艰难的岁月里，能够为人类的彻底解放——伟大的共产主义事业艰苦奋斗，我们在今天这美好的日子里为什么不能为社会主义、共产主义事业鞠躬尽瘁呢？能！能！我们一定能！否则，就对不起烈士！先烈们的理想，我们要完成！我们一定要完成！而且正在完成！
