The Direction of the Japanese People's Hearts

On October 15th, 100,000 people in Tokyo held three demonstrations, protesting the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma by the American and Japanese reactionaries, demanding the pursuit of the mastermind, and demanding the Ikeda Cabinet step down. On the same day, fascists in Tokyo held a "grand" lecture at the Kyobashi Public Hall, supporting the assassination of Asanuma. However, in such a large venue, the audience, speakers, and reporters combined only amounted to a handful of people. This sharp contrast vividly illustrates the direction of the Japanese people's hearts! The upper picture shows the demonstration of transportation workers. The lower picture shows the desolate scene at the Kyobashi Public Hall.

    日本的人心向背
    十月十五日，东京十万群众举行三次示威，抗议美日反动派刺杀浅沼稻次郎的暴行，要求追究元凶，要求池田内阁下台。同一天，东京的法西斯分子在京桥公会堂举行“大”讲演会，支持对浅沼的行凶，然而偌大的一个会场，听众、讲演者和记者合在一起，只有寥寥数人。这个鲜明的对比，生动地说明了日本人民的人心向背！上图是交通工人的示威队伍。下图是京桥公会堂的冷清场面。
