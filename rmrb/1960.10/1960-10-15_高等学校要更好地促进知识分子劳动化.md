Institutions of higher education are one of the main fronts in our country for cultivating intellectuals. The requirement of our cultural revolution is the intellectualization of the worker-peasant masses and the laborization of intellectuals. Therefore, in the process of cultivating intellectuals, institutions of higher education should not only enable each student to possess advanced specialized knowledge, and promote them to lay a good foundation in intellectualization, but also promote each student to receive labor training, establish correct labor views and habits, so that they also lay a good foundation in laborization. Over the past two years, thanks to the implementation of the correct policy of combining education with productive labor, China's higher education has undergone extremely profound and gratifying changes, which has given the laborization of young intellectuals a good start. In institutions of higher education, we have initially formed a set of systems that combine education with productive labor, and created the necessary conditions for implementing this system. At the same time, due to the connection between theory and practice, and the combination of mental and physical labor, students' political consciousness has been greatly improved, and they have a deeper understanding of the party's line, principles and policies for the country's socialist revolution and socialist construction; their ideological feelings towards labor and the laboring people have undergone profound changes; they have a higher enthusiasm for socialist construction, thus loving the motherland, the Party, labor, and the laboring people more; their understanding of the knowledge they have learned is more profound than before, and they can use both their hands and brains, thus making many achievements in technical innovation and technical revolution, and making many valuable creations and inventions. These, in turn, have further promoted scientific research and teaching reform in institutions of higher education.

The combination of education and productive labor is needed for the socialist revolution, for socialist construction, for developing education with greater, faster, better and more economical results, and for building communism. Its purpose is to gradually eliminate the differences between urban and rural areas, workers and peasants, and mental and physical labor while eliminating all exploiting classes and all exploiting systems and their ideological influences, so as to laborize intellectuals and make labor the primary need of people's lives. From such a goal, then, although our existing achievements are huge, they are only the first step in a long march. We must recognize that the separation of education and productive labor originates from class society. This unreasonable separation has a history of thousands of years. Through the vigorous advocacy of the exploiting classes for thousands of years, and the use of high official positions and generous salaries to win over intellectuals, the exploited worker-peasant masses have also been deeply affected. Furthermore, our country's socialist revolution on the economic front, the political front, and especially the ideological front has not yet been thoroughly completed. The development level of our country's industrial and agricultural production is not high, and there is still a large difference in cultural level among the broad masses of our people. Therefore, for a considerable period of time, some remnants of bourgeois rights will still be retained, and certain unreasonable differences in material treatment between mental and physical labor will inevitably be retained. Therefore, to realize the combination of education and productive labor and achieve the goal of laborizing intellectuals, we must carry out a long and arduous struggle.

Over the past two years, institutions of higher education, through repeated education, extensive mass movements, and proof from practice, have made people accept that education must be combined with productive labor. However, some people still have some not entirely correct views on the purpose of the combination, how to combine, and to what extent to combine. For example, some people think that the intellectualization of the worker-peasant masses means that intellectuals should be "cutting-edge." Some people think that schools should not advocate cultivating cultured laborers, but only cultivate intellectuals who can labor. That is to say, they still want to be superior to the workers and peasants, do not want to eliminate the differences between intellectuals and workers and peasants, and think that intellectuals are superior to laborers, and mental labor is superior to physical labor. Some people are interested in labor that combines with their major and can learn technology, but not in labor that does not combine with their major and does not require special skills. Some people are willing to participate in physical labor for a short period, but not for a long period. That is to say, the purpose of their labor is still to gain more knowledge and skills through labor, and they have not yet thought of truly becoming an ordinary laborer. It is not surprising that this kind of thinking exists, because eliminating the ideological influence of the exploiting classes who have left behind the idea of belittling labor and the laboring people for thousands of years cannot be done without a long-term struggle and a fundamental and thorough transformation of this bourgeois worldview. Therefore, we should face this problem squarely, actively lead it, and many schools, in the process of practice, are further working to solve these problems with the spirit of continuous revolution. Some schools have already gained some good experience, which is worth learning from.

In order to enable students to receive better labor education, some schools have arranged both labor related to the major and labor unrelated to the major for students. This practice is very good. In the old society, after mental labor and physical labor were completely separated, there were also high and low distinctions in labor. This idea is still reflected today, such as looking down on manual labor and looking down on physical labor; looking up to productive labor and looking down on service labor; willing to participate in industrial labor in the city, but unwilling to participate in agricultural labor in the countryside, and so on. In particular, some students whose thinking has not been well transformed only agree to participate in labor in order to enrich their knowledge and skills. If we arrange students to participate in labor related to their major too much, or completely restrict them to participating in labor related to their major, this will not enable students to have a comprehensive contact with labor, and it will be difficult to eliminate the idea of dividing labor into high and low; at the same time, it will make students understand the significance of participating in labor purely from the perspective of improving their professional level. Improving students' academic level is one of the purposes of combining education and productive labor, but not the only purpose. Our requirement is, first of all, to enable students to cultivate the ideological feelings of the laboring people through labor. Appropriately arranging students to participate in various types of labor will make it easier for students to comprehensively understand the hard work of labor and the laboring people through various types of labor, so as to cultivate the ideological feelings of the laboring people.

Many schools have arranged both industrial labor and agricultural labor, which is a very good practice. In the old society, agricultural labor was looked down upon. In terms of urban and rural areas, the exploiting classes valued cities and belittled rural areas; in terms of industry and agriculture, they valued industry and belittled agriculture; in terms of mental labor and physical labor, agricultural labor was mostly heavy physical labor, so agricultural labor was particularly discriminated against. When students participate in agricultural labor, it is easier for us to conduct ideological education for students on gradually eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas, workers and peasants, and mental and physical labor. We should also recognize that the construction of our country is based on agriculture, and we must make every student deeply understand the important economic and political significance of agriculture as the foundation, so that they love agricultural labor and have the ambition to dedicate themselves to agriculture and build a new socialist countryside. At the same time, there are still activities of wealthy middle peasants and landlords and rich peasants in the countryside today. When students participate in agricultural labor and go deep into the countryside, it is also easier to conduct class education for them.

Many schools have arranged both on-campus labor and off-campus labor, which is also a very good practice. It is very necessary to establish industrial, agricultural or service labor bases in schools, which makes it easier for us to arrange labor time and labor progress, and ensure labor. However, it is necessary to arrange a certain amount of off-campus labor, because participating in a certain amount of off-campus labor can enable students to better learn from the struggle for production and recognize the correctness of the line, principles and policies of the national construction cause, and learn how to implement these principles and policies; learn the laboring people's organization, discipline, enthusiasm in production and construction, and the proletarian worldview, so as to better improve their political consciousness.

Many schools have arranged both short-term labor and relatively long-term labor, one year, half a year, or three months, under the established general education plan, which is also a very good practice. Short-term labor is convenient for combining with business, which is necessary. However, appropriately arranging longer periods of labor according to different schools can play a greater role in ideological education. The students in the 1959 graduating class of the Foundry Department of Tsinghua University were arranged to work for one year, and like workers, they were truly and realistically responsible for production. At the beginning, some students exposed the idea of ​​picking and choosing, starting from learning more technology; then, they exposed the idea of ​​being complacent after learning a little technology, wanting to change jobs and no longer humbly learning from experienced masters. These ideas all stem from individualism and technical viewpoints. They have not yet understood the importance of respecting labor and the laboring people, and have not yet understood the significance of combining education and productive labor. Their labor is to learn skills, and they regard the laboring people as only having more production skills than intellectuals. When the school handed over the responsibility of production to the students, and they took the production tasks seriously, they gradually realized the great responsibility and great contribution of the laboring people to the country's construction, and gradually realized the great fun in ordinary labor. They understood the important role of partial labor in the entire production, strengthened the overall concept; they understood that practice makes perfect, and through labor practice, they can have creations and inventions, and make a big technical revolution in labor; they must be responsible for production and responsible for the collective, so they demanded strict requirements on themselves and exercised their strong will; in this way, they could gradually learn further from the workers and peasants, and saw that the most valuable and most worthy of learning is the proletarian worldview, which is the noble quality of the laboring people.

There are many good experiences in combining education and productive labor. We should summarize them in a timely manner and learn from them carefully. The most important experience is: in the process of students participating in labor, we must always grasp ideological and political work and improve students' awareness of participating in labor and transforming their thinking. Some people think that labor itself has a transformative effect on people's thinking, so they only arrange labor and relax ideological and political work. This kind of thinking and practice is wrong. We must recognize that the important purpose of combining education and productive labor is to transform our learning, but also to transform our thinking and transform our outlook on life. The point where intellectuals are most deeply influenced by the exploiting classes in their thinking is the idea of ​​being detached from reality, detached from labor, and detached from the laboring people, starting from individualism. Therefore, in carrying out ideological and political work for students, we must first pay attention to the students' performance in actual labor, and constantly carry out ideological education. When a student can improve quickly in thinking, he can also improve in other aspects. Relaxing this aspect of work will not achieve the purpose of combining education and productive labor. Grasping ideological and political work and improving students' awareness of participating in labor and transforming their thinking, we can accelerate the improvement of students' political awareness, improve students' professional level, and achieve the goal of laborizing intellectuals.

The combination of education and productive labor is an indispensable path to improve the quality of education, improve political awareness, and laborize intellectuals. It has been proven by the practice of the past two years. However, this is only a beginning, and we must continue to work hard to create more and richer experience in this regard, so that our institutions of higher education can cultivate a large number of socialist laborers who are both red and expert, who can use their brains and hands, and who have a high degree of political consciousness.

### 高等学校要更好地促进知识分子劳动化

    高等学校要更好地促进知识分子劳动化
    高等学校是我国培养知识分子的主要阵地之一。我国文化革命的要求是工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化。因此，高等学校在培养知识分子的过程中，不仅应当使每一个学生具有高等的专门知识，促使他们在知识化方面打下较好的基础，而且同时应当促使每一个学生受到劳动锻炼，建立正确的劳动观点和习惯，使他们在劳动化的方面也打下较好的基础。两年来，由于贯彻了教育与生产劳动相结合的正确方针，我国高等教育事业有了极其深刻的、可喜的变化，使青年知识分子劳动化有了一个良好的开端。在高等学校里，我们已经初步形成了一套教育与生产劳动相结合的制度，创造了贯彻这一制度的必要条件。同时，由于理论与实际的联系，脑力劳动和体力劳动的结合，学生的政治觉悟有了很大的提高，他们对国家的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的路线方针，有了更深的领会；对劳动、对劳动人民在思想感情上有了深刻变化；对社会主义建设事业，有了更高的热情，从而更热爱祖国，更热爱党，更热爱劳动，更热爱劳动人民；对所学知识的领会较前深刻，能手脑并用，因而在技术革新、技术革命方面作出许多成绩，并有了不少很有价值的创造和发明。这些，又进一步推动了高等学校的科学研究和教学改革。
    教育与生产劳动相结合是社会主义革命所需要的，是社会主义建设所需要的，是多快好省地发展教育事业所需要的，是建设共产主义所需要的，它的目的是要在消灭一切剥削阶级和一切剥削制度及其思想影响的同时，逐步消灭城乡差别、工农差别和脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，使知识分子劳动化，使劳动成为人们生活的第一需要。从这样一个目标来看，那么，我们现有的成就虽然巨大，但还只是万里长征走了第一步。我们必须认识，教育与生产劳动的分离，起源于阶级社会。这种不合理的分离，已有几千年的历史。经过剥削阶级几千年来极力倡导，并利用高官厚禄收买知识分子，使被剥削阶级的工农群众也深受其影响。再者，我国在经济战线上、政治战线上、特别是思想战线上的社会主义革命还没有彻底完成，我国的工农业生产的发展水平还不高，在我国广大人民群众之间，文化水平还有很大差别，因而在相当长时期内还将保留着若干资产阶级法权的残余，脑力劳动和体力劳动在物质待遇上还不可免地保留着某些不合理的差别。因此，要实现教育与生产劳动相结合，达到知识分子劳动化的目的，必须进行长期艰巨的斗争。
    高等学校两年来，经过反复教育，经过广泛的群众运动，经过实践的证明，教育必须与生产劳动相结合已为人们所接受。但是有人对结合的目的，怎样结合，结合到什么程度，还存在一些不完全正确的看法。例如有人认为：工农群众知识化，知识分子就要“尖端化”。有人认为学校不应当提培养有文化的劳动者，只能提培养能劳动的知识分子。这就是说，他们仍想高出工农一头，不想消灭知识分子和工农两者之间的差别，认为知识分子比劳动者高一等，脑力劳动比体力劳动高一等。有人对结合专业的和能学到技术的劳动有兴趣，对不结合专业的和不需要特殊技能的劳动没兴趣。有人愿短期参加体力劳动，不愿长期参加体力劳动。这就是说，他们劳动的目的还是为了自己能通过劳动得到更多的知识技能，还没有想真正成为一个普通劳动者。存在这种思想是不奇怪的，因为消除几千年来剥削阶级遗留给人们的轻视劳动和轻视劳动人民的思想影响，不经过长期的斗争，不从根本上彻底改造这种资产阶级的世界观，是办不到的。因此我们应当正视这一问题，积极加以领导，许多学校在实践过程中，以不断革命的精神，正进一步着手解决这些问题。有的学校已经取得了一些好经验，这是值得我们学习的。
    为了使学生能接受更好的劳动教育，在安排学生的劳动中，有的学校既安排了同专业有关的劳动，又安排了同专业无关的劳动，这种作法很好。旧社会，把脑力劳动和体力劳动截然分开以后，又在劳动中分高低。这种思想在今天也还有反映，如看得起技术活，看不起体力活；看得起生产劳动，看不起服务劳动；愿意在城市参加工业劳动，不愿在农村参加农业劳动，等等。特别是有些思想没有很好改造的学生，他们专门为了丰富自己的知识和技能才赞成参加劳动。我们如果过多地安排学生参加与专业有关的劳动，或者完全限制在参加与专业有关的劳动，这就不能使学生全面地接触劳动，很难消除把劳动分高低的思想；同时会使学生单纯从提高自己专业水平的角度出发，来理解参加劳动的意义。提高学生学业水平，是教育与生产劳动相结合的目的之一，但不是唯一目的。我们的要求，首先是要使学生通过劳动，培养起劳动人民的思想感情。适当地安排学生参加多种劳动，这就比较容易使学生通过多种劳动，全面地了解劳动和劳动人民的辛勤，从而培养起劳动人民的思想感情。
    许多学校，既安排了工业劳动，又安排了农业劳动，这种作法很好。在旧社会是看不起农业劳动的，剥削阶级对城乡来说，重视城市轻视农村；就工农业来说，重视工业，轻视农业；就脑力劳动和体力劳动来说，农业劳动绝大部分还是比较繁重的体力劳动，因此，农业劳动特别受到歧视。学生参加农业劳动，就更便于我们对学生就逐渐消灭城乡差别、工农差别、脑力劳动体力劳动差别方面进行思想教育。更应该认识：我们国家建设是以农业为基础的，我们必须使每一个学生都深刻地认识以农业为基础的重要的经济意义和政治意义，使他们热爱农业劳动，具有献身农业，建设社会主义新农村的雄心壮志。同时，今天农村中还有富裕中农以及地主、富农的活动，学生参加农业劳动、深入农村时，也便于对他们进行阶级教育。　　　　　　　
    有不少学校既安排了校内劳动又安排了校外劳动，这种作法也是很好的。在学校里建立工业的、农业的或服务性的劳动基地，这是很必要的，这便于我们安排劳动时间和劳动进度，并使劳动有保证。但是必须安排一定的校外劳动，因为参加一定的校外劳动，才能使学生更好地从生产斗争中学习和认识国家建设事业的路线、方针和政策的正确性，并学习如何贯彻执行这些方针政策；学习劳动人民的组织性、纪律性、生产建设中的热情，和无产阶级的世界观，从而更好地提高政治觉悟。
    不少学校在既定的总的教育计划之下，既安排了短期劳动，又安排了较长期劳动，有一年的，有半年的，有三个月的，这种作法也是很好的。短期劳动便于结合业务，这是必要的。但是，根据不同的学校适当地安排较长时期的劳动，在思想教育上，能起更大的作用。清华大学铸造专业1959年毕业班的学生，安排了一年的劳动，同工人一样，真刀真枪地对生产负起责任来。开始，有些学生暴露了挑挑拣拣，从多学些技术出发的思想；继之，又暴露了学得一点技术就自满，想换工种和不再虚心向老师傅学习的思想。这些思想都是从个人主义、从技术观点出发的。他们还没有懂得尊重劳动和劳动人民的重要性，还没有懂得教育和生产劳动相结合的意义。他们劳动是为学技能，并把劳动人民看作仅仅比知识分子多一些生产技能。当学校把生产的责任交给学生，他们认真负责起生产任务来时，他们渐渐认识到，劳动人民对国家建设的重大责任和重大贡献，渐渐认识到平凡的劳动之中大有乐趣。他们懂得了部分劳动在整个生产中的重要作用，加强了整体观念；他们明白了熟能生巧，通过劳动实践，才能有创造发明，在劳动中大闹技术革命；他们要对生产负责，对集体负责，因此对自己要求严格起来，锻炼了自己的坚强意志；这样才使他们逐渐能在工人和农民身上进一步学习，看出了最可贵、最值得学习的是无产阶级的世界观，是劳动人民的高贵品质。
    教育与生产劳动相结合的好经验很多，我们应当及时总结，认真学习，其中最重要的一条经验是：在学生参加劳动的过程中，要自始至终抓紧思想政治工作，提高学生参加劳动和改造思想的自觉程度。有人认为劳动本身就对人们的思想起着改造的作用，因而只安排了劳动，而放松了思想政治工作。这种想法和作法是不对的。必须认识，教育与生产劳动相结合的重要目的是要改造我们的学习，也是要改造我们的思想，改造我们的人生观。知识分子在思想上受剥削阶级影响最深的一点，就是从个人主义出发的脱离实际、脱离劳动、脱离劳动人民的思想。所以对学生进行思想政治工作，首先要注意学生在实际劳动中的表现，不断地进行思想教育。当一个学生能在思想上较快地提高，在其他方面也就能随之而提高。放松这方面的工作就不能达到教育与生产劳动相结合所要达到的目的。抓紧进行思想政治工作，提高学生参加劳动、改造思想的自觉程度，我们才能加速提高学生的政治觉悟，提高学生业务水平，达到知识分子劳动化的目的。
    教育与生产劳动相结合是提高教育质量，提高政治觉悟，使知识分子劳动化的一条必经之路。它已经为两年来的实践所证明。但是，这还仅仅是一个开始，我们必须继续努力，在这方面创造更多更丰富的经验，从而使我们的高等学校能培养出大量的、又红又专的、能动脑又能动手的、有高度政治觉悟的社会主义的劳动者。
