Xiaoying Lane is an ordinary little lane in the city of Hangzhou. However, since January 1958, when our great leader Chairman Mao came here to inspect sanitation work, it has become a place familiar to people all over the country. The residents of Xiaoying Lane, bathed in the sunshine of the Party, use their hardworking hands to decorate this lane exceptionally clean and beautiful, and are extending its glory to every lane around it, and to every street under the Xiaoying Lane branch of the Shangcheng People's Commune.

Look, from the entrance of the lane to the end, it is still a narrow, quaint stone-paved path, but it is so straight and neat, without a single scrap of paper or garbage in sight. Along the high whitewashed walls of the rows of houses on both sides, there is a row of holly, pine, and cypress shrubs, and flowers of various colors. Every twenty or thirty steps in the lane, a park appears, including Xiaoying Park, March 8th Park, and some unnamed street parks and back gardens, all built on a piece of ruins, a pile of rubble, or a small vacant lot by the roadside, all small and exquisite. The largest is Xiaoying Park, with pavilions, rockeries, winding paths, ponds, streams, flowers, and trees, all arranged in a winding manner. Among them, several flowerbeds are filled with cherry blossoms, camellias, crape myrtle, wintersweet, chrysanthemums, roses... colorful and truly a riot of flowers. In front of and behind the houses throughout the lane, every inch of soil is utilized, planted with cabbage, rapeseed, and other vegetables, a patch of green.

In the autumn days of Jiangnan, the afternoon sun shines obliquely on the corners of the houses and treetops in Xiaoying Lane, making them even more vivid and moving. There are not many pedestrians in the lane. Several children who have finished school are tidying up the flowers and plants by the roadside. Occasionally, bursts of human voices come from the canteen and offices, where cadres of the commune and residents' committee are studying and holding meetings. Walking on the stone-paved path, smelling the intoxicating sweet fragrance of osmanthus flowers drifting from a street park in the lane, I can't help but have a strong wish: "How wonderful it would be if Chairman Mao could come and see it again!"

In fact, this wish is not only held by visitors, but also by every resident of Xiaoying Lane, and it is even stronger in their minds. They have turned it into a hundredfold or a thousandfold of effort, enthusiastically throwing themselves into the construction of the urban people's commune. Thousands of pairs of hardworking hands not only maintain the consistently advanced title of sanitation level, but also continuously improve and beautify it, reporting good news to Chairman Mao every year with outstanding achievements.

We walked into No. 56. This is a memorable tiled house, where Chairman Mao once inspected the water tank and vegetable garden in the courtyard. Here, we met Comrade Yang Peishan, the director of the Xiaoying Lane Residents' Committee, a thin, tall, simple, and sincere young man who excitedly told us: Xiaoying Lane branch is moving towards the goal of a "healthy residential area"! Their habit of maintaining sanitation anytime and anywhere makes everyone healthy. In the two years since Chairman Mao came, not a single resident in the entire lane has been to the hospital, and even colds are rare, and infectious diseases have disappeared (every resident has regular physical examinations and health records). As a result of their good health, they have reached the point where "everyone has something to do, and every family has no idle people." The commune has set up six factories, various collective welfare undertakings, and a spare-time health school. The spiritual outlook of the residents is thriving, and the communist style is increasingly taking shape. The residents of Xiaoying Lane also squeeze out time to help the surrounding lanes with sanitation and greening. As a result, many lanes follow suit and have reached advanced levels of sanitation work.

Comrade Yang Peishan very much regrets that he did not catch up with the time when Chairman Mao came here, as he was transferred here later. But he seems to have witnessed it with his own eyes, guiding us to visit the places Chairman Mao had walked, while describing Chairman Mao's words and deeds after entering the lane in a concrete and accurate manner. His face was devout, solemn, and excited, with an expression of infinite longing.

The residents of Xiaoying Lane, regardless of men, women, old or young, can almost describe all this in detail. The happy moment has passed two and a half years, but everyone feels as if it was just yesterday. They may have repeated the introduction to visitors more than a thousand times, but each time they cannot suppress their strong excitement. They regretted that they did not know in advance that Chairman Mao would come to this small lane to inspect sanitation, so that many people were stunned at the time. They clearly remember Chairman Mao's concern for people's health and praised them for their good sanitation work. At that time, the sanitation work in Xiaoying Lane was indeed already good. You should know that before liberation, this place was like the Dragon Beard Ditch in Beijing, known as the "world of ghosts." One measles epidemic would kill more than forty children. The entire lane was "filled with feces and urine, mountains of garbage, sewage everywhere, foul odors, rampant pests, and all kinds of diseases." But they said that when Chairman Mao came, they had only achieved a superficial cure. Since then, great strength has encouraged them, they have worked hard to seek fundamental cures, enhance the people's physique, and change the entire residential area's appearance, which has now been completely renovated.

For the sake of commemoration, people still cannot help but arrange and display the houses and objects that Chairman Mao visited and touched in their original state. The small pot and stove on the side of the aisle in No. 61, which Chairman Mao once opened and looked at, are no longer used for eating in the canteen, but the owner has wiped them clean and displayed them as they were. The main room of the old lady Ju Suwu's house at No. 42 is always bright and clean, spotless. The wintersweet flowers inserted in an empty wine bottle on the table at that time have long withered, but now they are replaced with lifelike paper flowers. In many places in the lane, there is a sentence posted: "Never forget that this is the place Chairman Mao visited!"

Reluctantly walking out of the end of the lane to say goodbye, the setting sun was already slanting to the west. The entire lane was shrouded in the afterglow of the setting sun, the houses, trees, flowers, stone-paved paths, and figures, interwoven into a magnificent picture.

    小营巷
    越人
    小营巷是杭州城里一条普普通通的小巷子。然而，自从1958年1月，我们伟大的领袖毛主席来到这里视察卫生工作以后，它成为全国人民熟悉的地方。小营巷居民沐浴在党的阳光里，用自己勤劳的双手，把这条巷子打扮得异常洁净秀美，并且正把她的光辉延伸到四周围的每一条巷子、伸到上城人民公社小营巷分社所属的每一条街道里去。
    你看，从巷口到巷尾，依旧是窄窄的古朴的石板小路，但却是那么笔直崭齐，没见一星半点的纸屑垃圾；两旁沿着一幢幢住屋的高高的白粉墙脚，一溜栽下冬青、松柏各式灌木和各色花朵。巷里每隔二、三十步就出现一个公园，有小营公园、三八公园，以及一些无名的街头小公园、后花园等，都是在一片废墟、一堆瓦砾或路边小块空地上筑成的，都小巧玲珑。最大的要算小营公园了，亭台楼阁、假山小径、池塘溪流、花草树木，也还曲折有致。其中几个花坛，樱花、茶花、紫荆花、腊梅花、菊花、蔷薇花……，五彩缤纷，真是花团锦簇。全巷屋前房后，见缝插针，一寸土也不让闲置，栽了白菜、油菜和其他蔬菜，一片葱绿。
    江南秋日，午后的阳光斜照着小营巷的屋角树梢，使得它们更加艳丽动人。巷里行人不多，几个放了学的孩子正在拾掇路边花草，间或从食堂和办公室里传出阵阵人声，那是公社和居民委员会干部们在学习和开会。走在石板小路上，闻着不知从巷里哪个街头公园飘送出来的一阵阵桂花的醉人甜香，我不禁产生一个强烈的愿望：“要是毛主席再来一次看看，该有多好啊！”
    其实这个愿望岂止参观的人才有，小营巷的居民人人都有，他们日思夜想，更加强烈。只是他们把它化作了百倍千倍的干劲，热情沸腾地投进城市人民公社的建设中去。几千双勤劳的手不仅保持住卫生水平一贯先进的称号，而且不断加以提高、美化，每年用优异的成绩向毛主席报喜。
    我们走进56号。这是一幢值得纪念的瓦屋，毛主席曾在这里检查过院子里的水缸和菜园。在这里，我们遇到小营巷居民委员会主任杨培山同志，这个瘦瘦高高、朴素诚恳的青年人兴奋地告诉我们：小营巷分社正向“健康居民地区”的目标迈进！他们随时随地保持卫生的习惯，使得他们人人身体健康。自从毛主席来过的两年多当中，全巷居民没一个进过医院，连患伤风感冒的都少见，传染病更是绝了迹（每个居民都常作体格检查，建立了健康档案）。而身体健康的结果，又使得他们达到“人人有事做，家家无闲人”的地步。公社办起了六个工厂，办起了各种集体福利事业，办起了一所业余卫生学校。居民的精神面貌蒸蒸日上，共产主义风格日益形成。小营巷居民还挤出时间去帮助四周围的巷子搞卫生，搞绿化。影响所及，许多巷子看样学样，达到了先进的卫生工作水平。
    杨培山同志非常遗憾他没有赶上毛主席来到这里的时间，他是后来调来的。但他像是亲眼目睹过的一般，一面引导我们沿着毛主席走过的地方去参观，一面具体而准确地叙述毛主席进巷以后的一言一语一举一动。他的脸容虔诚严肃而激动，带着无限向往的神情。
    小营巷的居民，无论男女老幼，几乎人人都能够细致入微地描绘出这一切来。幸福的时刻已经过去二年半了，但人人都觉得仿佛才是昨天的事。他们也许已经不止千百次地向参观的人们重复介绍过了，但每次都抑止不住强烈的激动、兴奋。他们惋惜着事先一点不知道毛主席竟会到这个小巷子来检查卫生，以至好多人当时都愕住了。他们清楚地记得毛主席关怀地问起人们的健康，称赞他们卫生工作搞得不错。当时小营巷的卫生工作确实已经搞得不错了，要知道解放前这里赛过北京的龙须沟，号称“鬼世界”，一次痳疹流行要死掉四十多个孩子，全巷“粪尿满街、垃圾成山、污水满地、臭气熏天、四害猖獗、百病俱全”。但是他们说，毛主席来的时候，他们还只做到治标程度。自那以后，巨大的力量鼓舞着他们，他们发愤图强，着手治本，增强人民的体质，改变整个居民区的面貌，如今已经大翻新了。
    为着纪念，人们至今情不自禁地把毛主席到过的屋子，接触过的东西按原样布置、摆设。61号里走道边上的小锅小灶，毛主席曾经揭开看过，如今吃食堂不再使用了，主人却把它们擦拭干净依样陈列着。42号居素吾老太太家的一间堂屋时时都窗明几净，一尘不染，当时桌上一只空酒瓶里插着的腊梅花早已谢了，现在用了做得栩栩如生的纸花代替着。巷里好多地方贴着这么一句话：“永远不要忘记这是毛主席到过的地方！”
    依依难舍地从巷尾走出告别时，夕阳已经西斜。整条巷子笼罩在落日的余辉里，房屋、树木、花卉、石板小路、人影，交织成一幅瑰丽的图画。
