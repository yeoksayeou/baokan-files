Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 18th: According to reports in local newspapers, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and handicrafts has been basically completed in the Viet Bac Autonomous Region and the second largest city, Haiphong, in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The socialist transformation of small vendors and agriculture has also been basically completed in the suburbs of the Autonomous Region and Haiphong City respectively.

Currently, all private industrial and commercial enterprises in the Viet Bac Autonomous Region have realized socialist transformation. Private industrial and commercial enterprises engaged in automobile transportation, printing, photography, medicine, cloth and other industries have implemented joint state-private operation or participated in other cooperative organizations. More than 3,600 handicraft producers in the entire autonomous region have joined cooperatives and production teams, accounting for 74.3% of the region's handicraft workers. The provinces of Thai Nguyen, Tuyen Quang, and Bac Kan under the jurisdiction of the autonomous region have basically completed handicraft cooperation. More than 4,000 small vendors in the entire autonomous region have formed many cooperative groups or switched to production. Bac Kan, Ha Giang, Thai Nguyen, Lang Son and other provinces have basically completed the cooperation of small vendors.

The transformation of private capitalist industry and commerce in Haiphong City was basically completed as early as June this year. The cooperation of handicrafts and agriculture in the suburbs of the city has also been basically completed. 80% of the city's handicraft workers and suburban farmers have joined primary cooperatives, and some primary cooperatives have been transformed into advanced cooperatives.

With the development of socialist transformation, new atmospheres have emerged in all walks of life. Now, the labor efficiency of handicraft cooperative members in the Viet Bac Autonomous Region has greatly improved compared with before cooperation. Many cooperatives have increased their capital accumulation and have purchased machines and other production tools to expand production. In the first nine months of this year, Haiphong City's industrial and handicraft production has completed 76.8% of the annual plan, an increase of 21% over the same period last year. Enterprises, institutions, and cooperatives have launched "Advanced Movement" and "Technical Innovation Movement" with great enthusiasm, creating favorable conditions for continuously increasing production and reducing costs.

    越北自治区和海防市私营工商业和手工业
    基本完成社会主义改造
    新华社河内18日电　据此间报纸报道：越南民主共和国越北自治区和第二大城市海防市已经基本完成资本主义工商业、手工业的社会主义改造。自治区和海防市郊区还分别基本上完成了对小商贩和农业的社会主义改造。
    目前，越北自治区的全部私营工商业户都已实现社会主义改造。各个经营汽车运输、印刷、摄影、医药、布匹等行业的私营工商业户已实行公私合营或参加其他合作组织。全自治区已有三千六百多个手工业生产者加入了合作社和生产组，占全区手工业者的74.3％。自治区所辖的太原、宣光、北?等省已基本完成手工业合作化。全自治区有四千多户小商贩已经组成许多合作组或转业参加生产。北?、河江、太原、谅山等省已基本完成小商贩的合作化。
    海防市私营资本主义工商业的改造工作，早在今年6月就已经基本完成。全市的手工业和郊区的农业合作化工作目前也已基本完成。全市80％的手工业者和郊区农户已经参加了初级合作社，有一部分初级社已经转为高级社。
    随着社会主义改造工作的展开，各行各业的工作也出现了新气象。现在，越北自治区的手工业合作社社员的劳动效率比合作化以前有了很大的提高，许多合作社由于资金积累日益增加，纷纷添购机器和其他生产工具来扩大生产。在今年头九个月，海防市的工业和手工业生产已完成了全年计划的76.8％，比去年同期增长了21％。各企业、机关、合作社轰轰烈烈地展开“先进运动”和“技术革新运动”，为不断增加生产和降低成本创造了良好的条件。此外，海防市还完成了全年水陆运输计划的73.1％，运输量比去年同时期增加了45.5％；港口的运输量已达到全年计划的74.7％，比去年同期增加22.8％。
