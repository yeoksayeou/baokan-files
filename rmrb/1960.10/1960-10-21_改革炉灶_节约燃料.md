The widespread development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movements has led to a continuous stream of innovations and creations in both urban and rural areas, ranging from production tools to living tools, from operating machines to power sources. Each innovation has brought great benefits to people. Some innovation projects are not technically complex and may seem like small things on the surface, but they have a significant impact on promoting production and improving life after being implemented. The earth steam stoves promoted by Ningjin County, Hebei Province, and the downdraft stoves promoted by Pingshan County, published on page two of this newspaper on the 19th, and the plum blossom stoves promoted by the Shiwang Commune in Santai County, Sichuan, published today, are examples of this.

In many places, after reforming the stoves and using steam for cooking, one boiler simultaneously supplies the steam needed for several steaming baskets. This not only saves fuel but also greatly shortens cooking time and improves cooking efficiency. If the nearby canteens are combined with an earth steam stove as the center to form a steam station, even more fuel and labor can be saved.

Reforming stoves and saving fuel is a very important task. Compared to the small individual stoves of the past, rural public canteens have demonstrated tremendous advantages in terms of planned grain consumption, ensuring adequate food, and liberating women's labor. However, some new problems have also arisen in certain aspects. For example, compared to the small individual stoves of the past, the fuel problem has been greatly reduced in terms of overall fuel consumption, but many changes have also occurred in terms of fuel use. When farmers cooked their own meals, various weeds, fallen leaves, and crop stalks could be used as fuel. After the canteen system was introduced, a single catering unit serves from a hundred to several hundred or even thousands of people. The stoves have changed, and some of the small and soft fuels used in the past are now largely unsuitable. The switch to firewood and coal has increased the consumption of wood and coal, and coal and wood are indispensable important materials in national economic construction and must be used sparingly. This is the contradiction. Reforming stoves and using earth steam stoves largely solves this contradiction. According to the experience of Ningjin and other places, fuel can generally be saved by about half after the stoves are reformed. According to the situation of the plum blossom stoves in the Shiwang Commune, more than half of the firewood is saved. This is a great contribution to the cause of socialist construction. Not to mention saving half, even if two or three tenths are saved, if the entire rural area implements it, two or thirty million tons of fuel can be saved in a year. Of course, these fuels will not all be coal, nor will they all be firewood. Even if coal, wood, and grass each account for one-third, nearly ten million tons of coal and the same amount of wood can be saved. This figure fully illustrates the enormous role of universally promoting earth steam stoves and plum blossom stoves in national construction.

There are many benefits to using earth steam stoves, and they are not difficult to promote. Many places have adhered to the principle of simplicity and convenience, adopting simple methods and using locally available materials to establish steam stations or central canteens using earth steam as thermal energy. The earth steam stove promoted in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, did not use any steel. The bricks, lime, pots, water tanks, chimneys, bamboo pipes, wooden plugs, and other materials used were either existing utensils or local products. A set of steam equipment only cost twenty-four yuan. Shantou Prefecture in Guangdong Province used pottery instead of steel to manufacture a set of boilers, which only cost more than 150 yuan, saving about 90% compared to using steel. The earth steam boilers trial-produced in Ningjin and Shen Counties in Hebei Province are also simple in structure, save materials, do not use steel, and do not use cement. With just some old bricks and old wood, it is possible to realize cooking with steam without spending money or spending very little money. Earth boilers made of substitute materials and steam stations established with simple equipment are very suitable for promotion in the vast rural areas.

It is difficult to burn large pots with thatch and fallen leaves. However, as long as we prescribe the right medicine and think of some ways, these soft fuels can still be used to burn large pots. Pingshan County, Hebei Province, recently changed the old stoves to "downdraft stoves," which solved this problem. This type of stove can automatically draw air, not only can it burn large pots with firewood, but it can also burn several pots at the same time. It not only replaces coal with firewood, but the amount of grass used is also more than half saved compared to the past. The 526 canteens in Pingshan County have universally established "downdraft stoves," and in eighteen days, more than 800,000 catties of coal have been saved. Using firewood and fallen leaves as fuel is completely in line with rural customs and has abundant sources. Now is the season when grass is yellowing and leaves are falling, and crops are maturing, making it the best time to collect firewood. "Bending over in autumn is better than turning around three times in winter." We should reform stoves on the one hand, and seize the opportunity to collect firewood on the other hand, and reserve enough winter fuel for the canteens. Because the amount of fuel to be reserved is very large, each commune and production team can organize some firewood cutting teams mainly composed of semi-laborers, and at the same time mobilize the masses to carry firewood and pick grass during their spare time to prepare the fuel needed for family heating in winter. The Jianguo First Production Team of Yangdian Commune in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, organized a professional firewood cutting team of more than 160 people to cut thatch and wild grass for a certain period of time, and in less than a month, they cut more than 380,000 catties of grass. This production team also mobilized its members to carry more than 200,000 catties of grass during their time off from work, greatly increasing the reserve of firewood.

We have already paid attention to arranging grain and vegetables for public canteens, and we should also pay attention to arranging fuel for public canteens. This is also an important link in running public canteens well. Reforming stoves can not only save a lot of fuel, but also greatly shorten the working hours of cooks and reduce the labor intensity of cooks, which also greatly saves manpower in the canteen. All localities should attach great importance to this matter, put in some effort seriously, and resolutely do it well.

### 改革炉灶　节约燃料

    改革炉灶　节约燃料
    技术革新和技术革命运动的普遍开展，使全国城乡从生产工具到生活工具、从操作机具到动力能源等等方面的革新创造层出不穷。每一种革新都给人们带来了很大的利益。有些革新项目，技术并不复杂，表面看来似乎是一些小事情，但推行以后，对于推动生产和改善生活的作用却很大，19日本报二版发表的河北宁晋县推广的土蒸汽炉和平山县推广的吸风灶，今天发表的四川三台县狮王公社推广的梅花灶，就是这样的例子。
    好些地方改造了锅灶，使用蒸汽做饭以后，一个锅炉同时供给几套蒸笼需要的蒸汽，不仅节约了燃料，还大大缩短了做饭时间，提高了做饭效率；如果以土蒸汽炉为中心，把附近的食堂联合起来，组成一个蒸汽站就能节省更多的燃料和劳力。
    改革炉灶、节约燃料是一项非常重要的工作。农村公共食堂比起过去一家一灶的小伙，在计划用粮、吃饱吃好和解放妇女劳动力等等方面，都显示了巨大的优越性。但是，在某些方面也带来了一些新问题，比如燃料问题跟一家一灶的小伙比，虽然在总的方面看大大减少了燃料的消耗量，但是从使用燃料的情况看来，也发生了许多变化。农民各自起伙做饭的时候，各种杂草、落叶和农作物的秸秆，都可用作燃料。食堂化以后，一个伙食单位，少的百十人，多的数百人甚至上千人，炉灶改变了，过去用的一些零星细软燃料，现在大都不适用了；改用木柴和煤炭，无形中增加了木材和煤炭的消耗量；而煤和木材都是国家经济建设中不可缺少的重要物资，必须节约使用。这就是矛盾。改革炉灶，使用土蒸汽炉，就在很大程度上解决了这一矛盾。根据宁晋和别的地方的经验，炉灶改造以后，一般可以节约一半左右的燃料，根据狮王公社的梅花灶的情况，节约烧柴一半以上，这都是对社会主义建设事业的一个伟大的贡献。不要说节约一半，就算节约二三成，全国农村如果全部推行起来，一年就可以节约两三千万吨燃料。当然，这些燃料不会全是煤炭，也不全是木柴，即以煤、木、草各占三分之一计算，也可以节约近千万吨煤和同样数量的木材。这个数字充分说明了普遍推广土蒸汽炉和梅花灶对国家建设有多么巨大的作用。
    使用土蒸汽炉有许多好处，也不难推行。很多地方都本着因陋就简的原则，采用简便办法，利用本地现有的材料，建立起蒸汽站或使用土蒸汽为热能的中心食堂。山西万荣县推广的土蒸汽炉，没有用一点钢材，所用的砖、石灰、锅、水缸、烟筒、竹管、木塞等物料，或者是原有的用具，或者是当地的产品，一套蒸汽设备只用了二十四元。广东汕头专区以陶代钢，制造一套锅炉，也只用了一百五十多元，比用钢铁节约90％左右。河北宁晋、深县等地试制的土蒸汽锅炉，也都是构造简单、用料节省，不用钢材，不用水泥，只要一些旧砖、旧木料，不花钱或者花很少的钱，就可以实现用蒸汽做饭。像这样用代用材料造的土锅炉，用简单设备建立的蒸汽站，非常适合在广大农村推广。
    用茅草落叶烧大锅，是有一定困难的。但是，只要对症下药，想些办法，这些细软燃料还是可以烧大锅的。河北平山县最近把旧式炉灶改为“吸风灶”，就解决了这个问题。这种灶能够自动吸风，不仅可以用柴草烧大锅，还能同时烧几个锅；不仅用柴草代替了煤炭，用草量也比过去节省一半以上。平山县五百二十六个食堂普遍建立了“吸风灶”，十八天时间，就节约煤炭八十多万斤。利用柴草落叶作燃料，完全符合农村的习惯，又有丰富的来源。目前正是草黄叶落、作物成熟的时期，是收集柴草最好的时期。“秋季弯弯腰，胜过冬季转三遭”。我们应当一面改革炉灶，一面抓紧时机，收集柴草，为食堂储备足够的过冬燃料。由于要储备的燃料数量很大，各个公社和生产队可以酌量组织一些以半劳力为主的打柴班子，同时普遍动员群众，利用工余时间，捎带打柴拣草，准备家庭冬季取暖所需的燃料。湖北孝感县杨店公社建国第一生产队，组织了一百六十多人的专业打柴班子，以一定时间砍茅草、打野草，不到一月时间，打草三十八万多斤。这个生产队还发动社员利用出工收工时间，捎带打草二十多万斤，大大增加了柴草的储备。
    我们已经注意了为公共食堂安排粮食、安排蔬菜，也要注意为公共食堂安排燃料。这也是办好公共食堂的一个重要环节。改革炉灶，不仅可以节约大量燃料，还能大大缩短炊事员的劳动时间，减轻炊事员的劳动强度，也就是大大节约食堂的人力。各地应该十分重视这件事情，认真下点工夫，坚决把它做好。
