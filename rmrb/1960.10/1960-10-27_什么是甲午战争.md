What is the Sino-Japanese War
Zhi Fei

The Sino-Japanese War, also known as the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, began in July 1894 when Japan launched a war of aggression in Korea, and lasted for ten months until April 1895, when the traitor Li Hongzhang went to Japan to sign the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Because 1894 was the year of Jiawu in the Chinese sexagenary cycle, it is called the "Jiawu War" in history books.

As far as the Sino-Japanese War is concerned, it was mainly the result of the conflict between British imperialism and Tsarist Russia in dividing spheres of influence in China. British imperialism (and American imperialism, whose power in China at that time was not strong enough) strongly supported Japan militarily and diplomatically in order to use Japan's aggressive forces to contain Tsarist Russia's expansion in Korea and Northeast China, and to profit from it. From the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War to its complete failure, with the aggravation of the serious situation, the Chinese people clearly recognized the true face of the imperialists, broke some confused ideas and illusions, and strengthened the Chinese people's determination to resist. In the course of the war, the Chinese people carried out a just struggle and displayed the heroic spirit of resisting aggression and defending the motherland.

Eighty years ago, in the late nineteenth century, China had been reduced to a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, while Japan was gradually becoming strong through the capitalist Meiji Restoration and was trying to carry out foreign aggression and expand its power. At that time, the main targets of aggression of Japan's aggressive "Continental Policy" were China and Korea.

In 1875, the first year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, a Japanese warship invaded Ganghwa Island in Korea. The fort fired a warning, and the Japanese warship took the opportunity to attack and destroy the fort, massacring soldiers and civilians. Using this as an excuse, it forced the Korean government to sign the Ganghwa Treaty. From then on, Japan cultivated pro-Japanese forces in Korea based on the Ganghwa Treaty. At that time, the political situation of the feudal rulers of Korea, like the Qing government, was plagued by internal corruption and foreign troubles. In March 1894, the Korean people responded to the Donghak Party uprising and opposed the government. The Korean government requested the Qing government to send troops. Li Hongzhang immediately sent Ye Zhichao to lead 2,500 infantry soldiers to Korea to suppress the people's uprising. Japan also took the opportunity to immediately send troops to Korea, occupying the most important military areas such as Seoul and Incheon. Japan's aggressive conspiracy had been completely exposed, but Li Hongzhang did not prepare for war, and only hoped that foreign countries would intervene.

At this time, the Chinese army was stationed in Asan (southwest of Seoul). In July 1894, the Japanese army broke into the Korean royal palace in Seoul, kidnapped the Korean king, and organized a government headed by Daewongun Yi Ha-eung, forcing it to abolish the treaties signed with China over the years. Pretending that the Korean government would ask the Japanese army to drive out the Qing army in Asan, the Sino-Japanese War began from then on. Ye Zhichao's army was isolated and helpless. At this time, Li Hongzhang still did not want to resist, and only mobilized reinforcements under public pressure, making superficial military arrangements.

When dispatching reinforcements across the sea, Li Hongzhang again used his foreign slave diplomacy, hiring the British merchant ships Kowshing, Irene, and Flying Whale at a high price to transport troops, and sending the warships Jiyuan, Weiyuan, and Guangyi to escort them, departing from Tianjin to Asan. When the ships arrived near Fengdao Island, the Japanese warship Yoshino and others carried out a piratical attack on the Chinese navy. The Jiyuan was an armored fast ship and the main force of the Chinese navy. It should have protected the Guangyi ship, but the captain Fang Boqian was afraid of death, abandoned the Guangyi, ordered to escape, hid in the thickest part of the armor, and even shamelessly raised a white flag. The Japanese warship Yoshino chased after it. Wang Guocheng, Li Shimao and other patriotic soldiers on the Jiyuan "disobeyed" Fang Boqian's order to escape and automatically fired the stern gun to bombard the Yoshino. The Yoshino was injured and dared not pursue it any further. Fang Boqian fled back to Weihaiwei, but concealed his crimes and was rewarded by the Qing court. The Guangyi ship was heavily damaged and had run out of ammunition. The officers and soldiers on the ship were unwilling to leave the warship to the Japanese invaders as prisoners, so they had to destroy the ship and go ashore. Since the escort warships had been destroyed and fled, the Japanese warships forced the Chinese soldiers on the fully loaded Kowshing to surrender. The Chinese soldiers sternly refused, showing the patriotic spirit of "preferring to die rather than surrender". The Japanese warships opened fire and bombarded them. The heroic Chinese soldiers fought back with rifles and were finally sunk by torpedoes. About 1,000 Chinese soldiers died heroically. Li Hongzhang was fully responsible for this failure to reinforce Asan, while the bravery and resourcefulness of the Chinese soldiers demonstrated the Chinese people's fearless patriotic spirit of resisting aggression.

After Li Hongzhang's maritime reinforcement failed, he sent Wei Rugui, Ma Yukun, Zuo Baogui, and Feng Sheng'a to lead about 15,000 troops from Liaodong to Korea in batches, stationed in Pyongyang, echoing the Asan garrison from the north and south.

Since the reinforcements crossing the sea had not fully arrived, Asan was completely surrounded by the Japanese invaders. While launching a sneak attack at sea, the Japanese invaders also dispatched infantry to attack Asan. Nie Shicheng was defeated, and Ye Zhichao led his army to flee to Pyongyang. Ye Zhichao was Li Hongzhang's confidant. This time, not only was he not held accountable for his defeat, but Li Hongzhang instead recommended him as the commander-in-chief of the various armies in Pyongyang, which determined the defeat of the Battle of Pyongyang.

The Japanese invaders were not satisfied with invading Korea. They wanted to further control the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea and invade the Chinese mainland, which led to the Sino-Japanese War at sea.

The most intense of the Sino-Japanese War at sea was the Battle of the Yellow Sea. In September 1894, Li Hongzhang sent five ships to transport twelve battalions of soldiers to reinforce Pyongyang, and Ding Ruchang led the entire naval fleet of thirteen warships to escort them. On the way, they were ambushed by Japanese warships flying the American flag. Ding Ruchang ordered to fight back, but the cowardly General Liu Buchan violated the agreed formation and ordered the fleet to line up horizontally with the main battleships in the middle, attempting to avoid artillery fire. Although Ding Ruchang was seriously injured on the flying bridge, he still sat on the deck to supervise the battle. The Japanese warships focused on attacking the small ships on the left and right wings, causing the formation to be chaotic. The Zhiyuan ship fought bravely, sinking a Japanese warship, but it was also injured and had run out of ammunition. At that time, Captain Deng Shichang said to the first mate Chen Jinkui: "The Japanese warships especially rely on the Yoshino. If this ship is sunk, it will be enough to seize their spirit and achieve success." He ordered the Zhiyuan ship to go full speed to ram the enemy ship. On the way to ram the Yoshino, it was sunk by a torpedo from an enemy ship. All 250 people on board died heroically. The Jingyuan ship was also injured due to its heroic fighting. Captain Lin Yongsheng also rammed the Japanese ship, but it was also hit by an enemy torpedo and sunk. All 270 people on board died at the same time. Their patriotic spirit of resolutely fighting and sacrificing heroically as a whole not only shines in history and is immortal, but also sets a glorious example for patriotic officers and soldiers who resisted aggression.

In this Battle of the Yellow Sea, because the Chinese soldiers bravely fought the enemy, both China and Japan suffered damage. The Japanese warships retreated south, and the Chinese fleet retreated back to Lushun. After repairs, it sailed back to Weihai.

Lushun and Dalian had strong forts and a large amount of military equipment stored there, guarded by six armies of infantry, totaling more than 30 battalions. Li Hongzhang ordered his fellow villager Gong Zhaoyu to lead and command them, but in reality, they did not belong to each other. Only Xu Bangdao's army fought a major battle with the Japanese army, suffering extremely heavy casualties. The other armies refused to provide assistance, so the Japanese invaders easily occupied Dalian and Lushun. Lushun and Dalian, known as the elite of the Beiyang fleet, were completely given to the Japanese aggressors. The traitor Li Hongzhang regarded the Beiyang Army and Navy as his personal property, so he advocated avoiding war and protecting himself militarily. When Lushun was in danger, Ding Ruchang once requested to lead the entire navy to assist and fight a decisive battle with Japan, but Li Hongzhang strictly ordered Ding Ruchang to guard the ships in Weihaiwei.

Weihai and the nearby Liugong Island had very dangerous terrain. There were forts on both the north and south shores, and naval mines were laid outside the harbor. It was extremely difficult for Japanese pirates to attack from the front. Japanese warships had probed twice and were both injured and fled. The Japanese invaders adopted the old method of attacking from the rear. In January 1895, the Japanese invaders used a part of their forces to feign an attack on Dengzhou, while using their main force to land at Chengshan, attacking Weihai from the rear. The garrison soldiers bravely resisted, killing and wounding many enemies, and sinking several enemy ships. The Chinese garrison successively sacrificed more than 2,000 people, and the north and south shores were lost one after another. The remaining Beiyang Fleet was trapped in the enemy's encirclement. Some generals colluded with foreign personnel and took the opportunity to persuade Ding Ruchang to "temporarily allow surrender to appease the public." Ruchang said: "I must die first, and I cannot bear to see this happen." He ordered the captains of each ship to sink their ships at the same time, but this group of cowards did not execute the order. Ruchang then ordered the remaining ten ships to ram through the encirclement, but the generals again resisted the order. Seeing that the situation was over, Ruchang committed suicide by poisoning himself. After Ding Ruchang's death, the American foreign national, Hower, colluded with a small group of treacherous captains and even falsely wrote a letter of surrender in Ding Ruchang's name, completely surrendering the eleven warships and military equipment in the port to the Japanese invaders.

Then, the Qing army was defeated again in Northeast China.

The corrupt Qing government, in a state of panic under the naval destruction and army defeat, sent the traitor Li Hongzhang across the sea to beg for surrender from the Japanese invaders, and signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki. In addition to recognizing Korea's independence, reparations and opening treaty ports, this treaty also ceded Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to Japan. Although the Qing government succumbed to the enemy, the people of Taiwan persisted in their anti-aggression and anti-treason struggle, severely hitting the Japanese aggressors and writing a praiseworthy and moving page in Chinese history.

    什么是甲午战争
    知非
    甲午战争又称中日战争，由1894年7月，日本在朝鲜发动侵略战争开始，至1895年4月，卖国贼李鸿章赴日签订马关条约为止，历时十个月，因1894年是甲午年，所以在历史书上称为“甲午之战”。
    就甲午战争来说，它主要是英帝国主义和帝俄在中国瓜分势力范围的冲突所导致的结果。英帝国主义（也有当时在中国势力还不够雄厚的美帝国主义）所以在军事上、外交上大力支持日本，就是为了借用日本的侵略势力遏止帝俄在朝鲜和中国东北的扩张，从中渔利。从甲午战争开始以至彻底失败，跟随着严重局面的加剧，使中国人民清楚地认识了帝国主义者的本来面目，打破了某些糊涂观念和幻想，坚定了中国人民的反抗斗志。在战争过程中，中国人民进行了正义的斗争，发扬了反抗侵略、保卫祖国的英勇正气。
    八十年前即十九世纪的后期，中国已沦为半封建半殖民地，日本则正经过资本主义化的明治维新逐渐强盛起来，力图对外侵略，扩张势力。当时日本所订的侵略性的“大陆政策”的主要侵略目标就是中国和朝鲜。
    1875年清光绪元年，日舰侵入朝鲜江华岛；炮台开炮示警，日舰就乘机攻毁炮台，屠杀军民，并以此为借口，强迫朝鲜政府订立江华条约。从此以后，日本根据江华条约，在朝鲜扶植亲日势力。当时朝鲜的封建统治者的政治和清政府一样，内政腐败，外患交迫，1894年3月，朝鲜人民响应东学党起兵反对政府，朝鲜政府请求清政府出兵，李鸿章即派叶志超率陆军二千五百人到朝鲜镇压人民起义。日本也借此立即派兵入朝，占据了汉城、仁川等最重要的军事地区。日本的侵略阴谋已完全暴露，而李鸿章却并不备战，专盼外国出面干涉。
    这时中国军队驻在牙山（在汉城西南）。1894年7月，日军在汉城闯入朝鲜王宫，掳朝鲜国王，另组织以大院君李昰应为首的政府，迫令其废除与中国历年所订的条约，并佯由朝鲜政府出面，请求日军驱逐牙山清军，中日战争从此开始。叶志超军孤立无援。这时李鸿章仍然不想反抗，只是迫于舆论才调动援军，作表面上的军事布置。
    当派遣援军渡海时，李鸿章又使用其洋奴外交的故智，用重价雇用英国商轮高升、爱仁、飞鲸三艘轮船运兵，另派济远、威远、广乙三支军舰护送，由天津出发开赴牙山。当舰只开到丰岛附近的时候，日舰吉野等对中国海军进行海盗式的袭击；济远是铁甲快舰，是中国海军的主力，它本来应该掩护广乙舰，但管带（舰长）方柏谦贪生怕死，丢弃广乙，下令逃跑，自己躲在铁甲最厚的地方，甚至无耻地挂起白旗。日舰吉野尾追不放，济远水手王国成、李仕茂等爱国士兵“违抗”方柏谦的逃跑命令，自动发尾炮轰击吉野。吉野受伤，不敢再追，方柏谦逃回威海卫，却隐瞒了自己的罪恶，得到清廷的奖赏。广乙舰受伤很重，弹尽援绝，舰上的官兵不肯把军舰留给日寇作俘虏，只好毁船登岸。护送的军舰既已毁坏逃跑，日舰就强迫满载军队和军火的高升轮上的中国士兵投降，中国士兵严词拒绝，表现了“甘死不愿降”的爱国主义精神；日舰开炮轰击，英勇的中国士兵用步枪还击，最后被鱼雷击沉，中国军队约一千人壮烈殉国。这一次没有完成增援牙山的任务，李鸿章要负全部责任，而中国士兵的英勇机智，表现了中国人民反侵略的大无畏的爱国主义精神。
    李鸿章海上增援失败，又由陆上派卫汝贵、马玉昆、左宝贵、丰升阿率领约一万五千人从辽东分批进入朝鲜，驻扎平壤，与牙山守军南北呼应。
    渡海援军没有完全达到，牙山已完全处于日寇的包围之中，日寇在海上偷袭的同时也出动陆军，进攻牙山。聂士成战败，叶志超率军逃到平壤。叶志超是李鸿章的亲信，这次战败，不但没有被追究责任，李鸿章反而保举他作平壤各军的总指挥，这就决定了平壤大战的溃败。
    日寇并不以侵略朝鲜为满足，它要进一步控制黄海渤海，侵略中国内地，这就爆发了甲午海战。
    甲午海战中最激烈的一次，是黄海大战。1894年9月，李鸿章派轮船五艘运兵十二营援平壤，丁汝昌率海军全队兵舰十三艘护送。中途遭到了悬挂美国旗的日寇军舰的偷袭，丁汝昌下令应战，而贪生怕死的总兵刘步蟾却违反议定阵势，命令舰队横列主力舰居中，企图躲避炮火。丁汝昌在飞桥上虽受重伤，仍坐甲板上督战，日舰专攻左右两翼小船，阵脚混乱。致远舰英勇作战，击沉了一艘日舰，自己也受了伤，而且弹药已尽。当时，管带邓世昌对大副陈金揆说：“倭舰专持吉野，苟沉此舰，足以夺其气而成事”，就命令致远舰开足马力撞击敌舰，在向吉野撞击途中，被敌舰鱼雷击沉，全船二百五十人壮烈牺牲。经远舰也由于英勇作战而受伤，管带林永升也鼓轮撞日舰，亦中敌鱼雷沉没，全船二百七十人同时殉难。他们坚决作战、全体英勇牺牲的爱国精神，不只照耀史册，永垂不朽，而且给反抗侵略的爱国官兵作出了光辉的榜样。
    这次黄海大战，因中国士兵奋勇杀敌，中日双方均有损伤，日舰向南退去，中国舰队退回旅顺。经修理后开回威海。
    旅顺、大连有坚固的炮台和大量的军械储藏，由陆军六个军驻守，共三十余营，李鸿章命令他的同乡龚照璵统率指挥，实际是各不相属。其中只徐邦道一军与日军大战，伤亡极重，各军不肯救援，日寇就此轻易地占领了大连和旅顺。号称北洋精华的旅大，全部送给了日本侵略者。卖国贼李鸿章是把北洋的陆海军看成是他个人的私物，所以在军事上主张避战自保。当旅顺危急时，丁汝昌曾经请求率全部海军往援，与日本决一死战，李鸿章却严令丁汝昌在威海卫守船。
    威海和附近的刘公岛形势非常险要，南北两岸都有炮台，口外布设水雷，日本海盗想从正面进攻是极端困难的，日舰曾经两度窥探，都被击伤逃去。日寇就采取了抄袭后路的老法。1895年1月，日寇用一部分兵力佯攻登州，而用主力在成山登陆，抄袭威海后路。驻守士兵英勇抗击，杀伤敌人很多，并击沉敌舰数艘。中国守军先后牺牲两千余人，南北两岸相继失守，残余的北洋舰队，陷入了敌人的包围之中；英勇的炮台守军伤亡殆尽，主力舰定远也受了伤，只好自行凿沉。日寇海陆军猛攻北洋舰队，有些将领勾结洋员乘机劝丁汝昌“姑许乞降以安众心”。汝昌说：“我必先死，断不能坐睹此事”。他就下令各舰管带同时沉船，可是，这群懦夫没有执行。汝昌又令余船十艘猛撞突围，各将领又反抗命令。汝昌见大势已去，服毒自杀。丁汝昌死后，美籍洋员浩威勾结一小部分卖国的管带，竟自冒名丁汝昌写了投降书，将港内十一艘军舰和军资器械完全缴给了日寇。
    接着，清朝陆军又在东北溃败。
    腐朽的清政府在海军复没、陆军溃败下，惊慌万状，派了卖国贼李鸿章渡海向日寇乞降，签订了马关条约。这个条约除了承认朝鲜独立，赔款和开商埠外，还割让了台湾和澎湖列岛给日本。清政府虽然对敌屈服，但台湾人民则坚持反侵略反卖国的斗争，沉重地打击了日本侵略者，为中国历史写下了可歌可泣的一页。
