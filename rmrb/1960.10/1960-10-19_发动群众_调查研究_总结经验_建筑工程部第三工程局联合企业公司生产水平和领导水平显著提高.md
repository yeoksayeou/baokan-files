    Launch the Masses, Investigate and Research, Summarize Experience
    The Third Engineering Bureau United Enterprise Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering Significantly Improves Production and Leadership Levels

    (Our report) The Third Engineering Bureau United Enterprise Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has adopted a method combining large-scale mass movements with dedicated personnel responsible for research, promptly summarizing and promoting advanced experiences in the increased production and conservation campaign, resulting in significant improvements in both production and leadership levels. As of September 27, they had completed 93.07% of the annual plan.

    With the deepening of the increased production and conservation and technical revolution movements, this company has seen a surge of innovations and creations. To adapt to this new situation, the company's Party committee adopted a method combining large-scale mass movements with dedicated personnel, closely focusing on the work of investigation, research, and summarizing experience. Throughout the company, they implemented a system combining investigation and research, writing articles, and guiding overall work. It was stipulated that leading cadres must spend two-thirds of their time squatting at selected "points" during their time深入 into the front lines, promptly discovering and cultivating new things at these "points," summarizing advanced experiences, analyzing and researching them, identifying the essence of the problems, figuring out the rules, making them systematic and organized, and then promoting and applying them to guide overall work. Since the implementation of this system, leading cadres at all levels have generally attached importance to the work of investigation, research, and summarizing experience. In July and August alone, leading cadres at all levels wrote more than twenty experience-based summaries. For example, Fu Chunling, deputy director of the Party Committee Office, in the process of going into the timber processing plant, summarized the leadership experience of the oil and wood workshop in achieving continuous production of "red every day" for 210 days, and based on their skillful use of the two-pronged approach to production management, proposed the leadership method of "doing one, preparing two, considering three," which was widely promoted throughout the company. Because the leadership grasped not only the production of the day, the ten-day period, and the month, but also the preparation for the next day, the next ten-day period, and the next month, while also considering the tasks for the whole ten-day period, the whole month, and the whole quarter, they gained great initiative in their work, and have exceeded the state plan every month since the beginning of this year.

    In order to better carry out the work of investigation, research, and summarizing experience, this company extensively mobilized the masses and universally established mass investigation and research groups in Party organizations at all levels throughout the company, led by the secretary and with the participation of workers, technicians, and management cadres. Currently, the twenty-seven investigation and research groups established throughout the company have one hundred and seventy-eight participants, forming a network of investigation and research distributed throughout the company. Since July, the summaries, experiences, reports, articles, etc., written by members of the investigation teams have reached more than two hundred, including thirty-one typical experience summaries, covering experiences in production technology, business management, leadership methods, as well as typical summaries of culture and education, pig raising and vegetable growing, and militia security. These experience summaries from the masses not only provided the leadership with information in all aspects and collected a large amount of data, but also powerfully guided various tasks. Now, this company has established a relatively systematic and complete set of data, and workshops and departments have universally developed a good habit of promptly summarizing their work.

    To coordinate with the mass mobilization to carry out large-scale investigation, research, and summarizing experience, this company also established a dedicated investigation and research office under the direct leadership of the Party committee. In their work, they mainly contact the broad masses of workers and staff through the publication of journals, promptly understanding and disseminating advanced experiences to guide the current central work and political movements. At the same time, based on the situations reflected by the masses, they give topics to the investigation and research groups and assign tasks to them, so that the investigation and research groups can summarize the situations reflected by the masses, improving what is imperfect and completing what is incomplete. This work has played a great role in summarizing experience, strengthening research, improving leadership level, and promoting production.

    发动群众　调查研究　总结经验
    建筑工程部第三工程局联合企业公司生产水平和领导水平显著提高
    本报讯　建筑工程部第三工程局联合企业公司，采用大搞群众运动和专人专职负责研究相结合的方法，及时总结和推广增产节约运动中的先进经验，使生产水平和领导水平都得到了显著的提高。截至9月27日止，已完成全年计划的93.07％。
    随着增产节约和技术革命运动的深入开展，这个公司涌现了大量的革新创造。为了适应这种新形势，公司党委采取大搞群众运动和专人专职相结合的方法，紧紧抓住了调查研究和总结经验的工作，在全公司范围内，实行调查研究、写文章、指导全面工作相结合的制度。规定领导干部在深入第一线的时间里，必须以三分之二的时间蹲“点”，在“点”里及时地发现培养新生事物，总结先进经验，经过分析研究，找出问题的本质，摸出规律，使之条理化，系统化，再加以推广和运用，指导全面的工作。实行这个制度以来，各级领导干部普遍重视了调查研究和总结经验的工作，7、8两个月，各级领导干部就写出了二十多篇经验性的总结。如党委办公室副主任傅春令在深入木材加工厂过程中，总结了油木车间连续二百一十天生产日日红的领导经验，并根据他们在生产管理中，善于运用两手抓的工作方法，提出了“做一备二考虑三”的领导方法，在全公司普遍推广。由于领导上既抓当日、当旬、当月的生产，又抓次日、次旬、次月的准备，同时考虑到全旬、全月、全季的任务，因而在工作上取得了很大的主动权，今年以来月月超额完成国家计划。
    为了更好地把调查研究和总结经验的工作开展起来，这个公司广泛地发动群众，在全公司各级党组织中普遍建立群众性的调查研究小组，由书记领导，吸收工人、技术人员、管理干部参加。现在全公司已经建立的二十七个调查研究小组，有一百七十八个人参加，构成了一个分布全公司的调查研究网。7月以来，由调查小组成员写出的总结、经验、报告、文章等达二百多篇，其中典型的经验总结即有三十一篇，既包括生产技术、经营管理、领导方法等方面的经验，又包括文化教育、养猪种菜、民兵治保等方面的典型总结。这些来自群众的经验总结，不仅为领导上提供了各个方面的情况，搜集了大量的资料，也有力地指导了各项工作。现在，这个公司已经建起了一套比较系统和完整的资料，各个车间、科室普遍养成了及时总结工作的良好风气。
    配合发动群众大搞调查研究和总结经验，这个公司还在党委直接领导下，成立了专人专职的调查研究室。在工作中，他们主要通过刊物的出版与广大职工群众联系，及时地了解和传播先进经验，以指导当前的中心工作和政治运动，同时又根据群众反映上来的情况，给调查研究小组出题目，布置任务，由调查研究小组将群众反映上来的情况加以总结，不完善的使之完善，不成套的使之成套。这一工作对总结经验、加强研究、提高领导水平、推动生产都起了很大作用。
