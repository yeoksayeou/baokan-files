Celebrating Our Great National Day

The great People's Republic of China is eleven years old. Eleven years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong said at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of our Party: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." The development of history has confirmed this great prediction by Comrade Mao Zedong. Over the past eleven years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have advanced by leaps and bounds on the road of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and have achieved very great achievements.

Today, when all the people are joyfully and enthusiastically celebrating the glorious festival of the motherland, our country, on the basis of the continuous great leap forward in the past two years and after completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) ahead of schedule, has achieved new and great victories in the continued leap forward. The people of all ethnic groups, united around the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, are vigorously launching a production increase and economy campaign centered on grain and steel, filled with vigorous labor enthusiasm everywhere, and full of confidence in the victory of our cause.

On the industrial front, since the beginning of this year, workers, technicians, and management personnel across the country have universally launched a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, greatly promoting the continued leap forward in industrial production. From January to August, the cumulative output of major industrial products such as steel, iron, steel products, iron ore, coke, electricity generation, crude oil, sulfuric acid, and cement all increased by about 40% compared with the same period last year. Taking steel production as an example, the steel output in the first eight months of this year is equal to seventy times the steel output of the entire year of 1949, several million tons more than the steel output of the entire year of 1958, and almost equal to the steel output of eleven months of 1959. This is an achievement of great significance. The high speed of industrial development has become possible because our Party has mobilized and organized the broad masses of workers and staff to implement the Party's general line for building socialism, and to implement the Party's policy of "walking on two legs," especially the policy of simultaneously developing large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises. As in last year, about half of this year's pig iron output is produced by the iron smelting enterprises of "small native furnace clusters."

On the agricultural front, under the leadership of the Party, the people's communes continue to exert their superiority and have undertaken many production and construction undertakings that were previously unimaginable in rural areas. The people's communes organized the broad masses of peasants to wage arduous and tenacious struggles against the major natural disasters that occurred this year and achieved great victories. In the Jin, Ji, Lu, and Yu areas, it did not rain in many places for more than two hundred days. Liaoning, Jilin, and other places were hit by extraordinarily large floods. Coastal areas were also hit by multiple strong typhoons. Generally speaking, the disaster-stricken area this year reached more than 900 million mu, accounting for about half of China's total sown area, making it the year with the most severe natural disasters since the founding of the country. However, as a result of the people's communes organizing the peasants to fight the disaster, the area affected by disasters only accounted for 300 million mu of the 900 million mu affected. Many areas with relatively light disasters still achieved good harvests, and the severity of the natural disasters was greatly reduced in severely affected areas. If such a large natural disaster had occurred before liberation, it would inevitably have resulted in barren land for thousands of miles; if there had been no socialist system, if there had been no people's communes, the losses would have been much more severe than they are now. The new socio-economic organization – the people's commune, which has only been established for two years – has become more consolidated in the struggle against severe natural disasters.

New achievements have also been continuously achieved this year in the basic construction front, in the transportation and commerce front, and in the cultural and educational front in all departments of the national economy. This year, a high tide of establishing urban people's communes has emerged across the country. More than 1,000 urban people's communes have been established across the country, organizing the broad masses of housewives into production and social welfare undertakings, creating new conditions for developing production and fundamentally transforming the face of the city.

The task before us is to further launch a production increase and economy campaign centered on grain and steel, and strive to achieve greater achievements on all fronts. In terms of industry, we must guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the industrial production plan approved by the National People's Congress, increase the production of more steel, iron, steel products, coal, and various industrial products, and make preparations for production and construction next year. In terms of agriculture, the current task is to implement the Party Central Committee's policy of the entire Party and the entire people engaging in agriculture and grain production in a big way. On the basis of achieving great victories in the fight against natural disasters, we must actively and conscientiously do a good job in the autumn harvest, and not let a single grain of grain, a single cotton boll, or other agricultural crop results be left on the ground. This requires truly grasping the harvest time, rationally organizing labor, and conducting inspection work. At the same time, we must also actively and conscientiously do a good job in autumn plowing and winter plowing, expand the sown area of autumn planting as much as possible according to various conditions, accumulate better quality and larger quantities of fertilizer, strive to improve the irrigation system, and strive to obtain a better summer harvest next year than in any previous year.

Our road forward is broad, and our construction prospects are infinitely bright. The great vitality of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes has become increasingly apparent. It is entirely possible for our people to strive to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in less than ten years, strive to realize the National Agricultural Development Program two or three years ahead of schedule, and strive to realize the Twelve-Year Science Development Plan ahead of schedule, so as to build our country into a great socialist country with a modern industry, a modern agriculture, and a modern science and culture more quickly. Of course, there will be difficulties on the road forward. Since our country was originally a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country under imperialist rule, and was very backward in terms of economy and science and technology, and there have only been eleven years of construction since the national liberation, it is inconceivable that there would be no difficulties. However, people know that the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party have never bowed their heads in the face of any difficulties, and are good at overcoming various difficulties. Our revolutionary and construction cause is precisely the achievement of constantly overcoming difficulties. As long as our people further strengthen unity, adhere to the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results and a whole set of policies of "walking on two legs," hold high the banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, fully develop our Party's fine revolutionary traditions of hard struggle, down-to-earth work, burying our heads in hard work, and striving for self-improvement, rely on our own hands, and rely on our own labor, we will definitely be able to overcome all unexpected difficulties, quickly achieve our great goals, and realize our beautiful ideals.

On this eleventh anniversary of the founding of the country, our people not only celebrate their own victories with joy and excitement, but also express the warmest sympathy and the highest respect to the people of all countries in the world for their struggle for their own bright future and happiness.

In the past year, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become more consolidated and stronger. The great Soviet people have achieved brilliant achievements in comprehensively carrying out communist construction, and have successfully launched space ships twice, leaving the United States further behind in the latest science and technology. The socialist construction cause of the brotherly countries in Asia and Europe is also thriving. The peaceful foreign policy of the socialist countries has won the widespread support of the people of all countries, and their international prestige and influence are constantly growing. The people of the socialist countries have the common great ideal of communism. In order to realize this ideal and to oppose the common enemy, the friendship between them is everlasting, and their unity can never be destroyed by any force.

In the past year, the people of all countries' struggle to win world peace, to win and maintain national independence, and to win democracy and social progress have seen unprecedentedly large-scale new upsurges.

U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit and intensification of the Cold War have made more and more people see through its conspiracy to talk about "peace" while stepping up arms expansion and war preparations. The people of the world see that U.S. imperialism is strengthening its aggressive military blocs and strengthening its overseas military bases, especially arming West Germany and Japan. Therefore, the movement to stop U.S. imperialism from instigating a world war and to defend world peace is attracting an increasingly wide range of people to participate.

The storm of the anti-imperialist national democratic movement is sweeping across the continents of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The heroic revolutionary struggle of the Cuban people against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs is inspiring the people of Latin America and all countries in the world that have been invaded by U.S. imperialism. The Japanese people's nationwide continuous struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance broke U.S. President Eisenhower's plan to "visit" Japan and pushed Nobusuke Kishi, one of the heads of the Japanese reactionaries, off the stage. Struggles against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs have also broken out in Laos, South Korea, South Vietnam, and Turkey.

The heroic Algerian people's sacred national liberation war against the French colonial rulers is inspiring the awakening of the entire oppressed nation of Africa. On this land once known as the "silent continent," a great anti-colonialist struggle is boiling. The Congolese people's struggle against the Belgian colonial rulers, especially against U.S. imperialism's aggression in the name of the United Nations, has won the widespread sympathy and support of the people of the world.

The old colonial system of imperialism has collapsed. The new colonialism pursued by U.S. imperialism is also being hit harder and harder.

The workers' movements in the United States and Western European countries have also developed further over the past year. Large-scale strike movements have occurred continuously, powerfully counterattacking the offensive of monopoly capital.

The economic situation of the capitalist world is continuing to deteriorate. The United States is facing a new economic crisis, its position in the world economy is weakening, while the monopoly capital of West Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, and other countries is trying its best to strengthen its own position. The struggle between U.S. imperialism and other imperialisms for redividing spheres of influence is unfolding tensely in Western Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and even Latin America. The internal difficulties of the imperialist countries and the contradictions between them are intensifying day by day. Although U.S. imperialism is struggling desperately to reverse its decline, its aggressive policies and war policies are opposed by the people of the world and are falling into an increasingly isolated position.

The development of the international situation over the past year shows that the socialist forces, the national liberation forces, and the forces of peace and democracy are further overwhelming the imperialist forces, the reactionary forces, and the forces of war, that is to say, the East Wind is further overwhelming the West Wind. This situation is very favorable to the world people's struggle for peace, democracy, national liberation, and the cause of socialism, and it is also very favorable to the Chinese people in striving for a peaceful international environment in order to further build our motherland.

The Chinese government and the Chinese people have consistently carried out unremitting struggles for the cause of peace. We support the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in their peaceful initiatives and efforts to strive for disarmament, a halt to nuclear weapons testing, a settlement of international disputes through negotiations, and a relaxation of international tensions. The Chinese people warmly support the struggle of the people of all countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to win and maintain national independence. We believe that these struggles are also a powerful support for our people. We have consistently worked to establish and develop peaceful coexistence relations with all countries, and to expand the peaceful area of Asia and Africa. Since this year, the friendly relations between our country and Asian and African countries have achieved new developments on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Our country has successively signed treaties of friendship and non-aggression or treaties of peace and friendship with Burma, Nepal, Afghanistan, and Guinea. The Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty to be signed today will make the Sino-Burmese border forever a border of peace and friendship, creating a brilliant example of peaceful coexistence between Asian countries. The friendly relations between our country and the people of Latin America have also greatly developed. Our country has formally established diplomatic relations with Cuba. From then on, the friendly cooperation and mutual support between China and Cuba will be further developed. Not long ago, Premier Zhou Enlai reiterated that our government advocates that all countries on the Asian and Pacific coasts, including the United States, sign a treaty of non-aggression and turn this region into a nuclear-free zone. This proposal has been widely welcomed by the people of Asian countries. The Chinese government and the Chinese people's firm stance in defending world peace has been supported by the broad masses of people all over the world. Our friends are all over the world. The number of foreign guests who came to China to attend the National Day celebrations this year exceeded any previous year.

Our people will not forget that U.S. imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan and is constantly carrying out military provocations and war threats against our country. Our people must liberate Taiwan and resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's policies of aggression and war. U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to isolate new China by various despicable means will never succeed. We are deeply convinced that as long as the people of the world make full use of the current excellent situation, strengthen the struggle of the people of all countries to win and safeguard world peace, national independence, social progress, and the cause of socialism, and form a broad united front against imperialism, they will surely be able to defeat the aggressive policies and war policies of the imperialist group headed by the United States and realize the great task of defending world peace.

Today, our people enter the twelfth year of the founding of the country with infinite joy. In the past short eleven years, earth-shaking changes have taken place in China, and even more favorable changes have taken place in the world situation for peace and socialism. We are getting better day by day, and the enemy is rotting day by day. Let us, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, hold high the banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and strive to build our country into a great socialist country as soon as possible, and work together with the people of the world to defeat the forces of aggression and war headed by U.S. imperialism and defend world peace!

### 庆祝我们伟大的国庆

专栏：社论

    庆祝我们伟大的国庆
    伟大的中华人民共和国诞生十一周年了。十一年前，毛泽东同志在我们党的七届二中全会上说：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”历史的发展，证实了毛泽东同志这个伟大的预言。十一年来，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的道路上大踏步地前进，已经取得非常伟大的成就。
    今天，当全体人民欢腾热烈庆祝祖国的光辉节日的时候，我们的国家在过去两年连续大跃进的基础上，在提前完成第二个五年计划（1958—1962）的主要指标之后，又取得了继续跃进的新的巨大胜利。各族人民群众团结在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央周围，正在大力展开一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动，到处洋溢着蓬蓬勃勃的劳动热情，对我们的事业充满着胜利的信心。
    在工业战线上，今年以来，全国工人、技术人员和管理人员普遍展开了技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，大大促进了工业生产的继续跃进。1月至8月累计，钢、铁、钢材、铁矿石、焦炭、发电量、原油、硫酸、水泥等主要工业产品的产量，都比去年同期增长40％左右。拿钢的生产来说，今年头八个月的钢产量，等于1949年全年钢产量的七十倍，比1958年全年的钢产量还多几百万吨，差不多等于1959年十一个月的钢产量。这是具有重大意义的成就。这种工业发展的高速度所以成为可能，是因为我们党动员和组织广大职工群众贯彻执行了党的建设社会主义的总路线，贯彻执行了党的“两条腿走路”的方针，特别是大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针。同去年一样，今年的生铁产量，有一半左右是依靠“小洋群”的炼铁企业生产的。
    在农业战线上，人民公社在党的领导下，继续发挥自己的优越性，兴办了许多过去在农村中难以设想的生产建设事业。人民公社组织广大农民群众，对今年发生的很大的自然灾害，进行了艰苦顽强的斗争，取得了很大的胜利。晋冀鲁豫一带，不少地方二百多天没有下雨。辽宁、吉林等地，受到了特大洪水的侵袭。沿海地区还受到多次强烈台风的袭击。大体看来，今年全国受灾面积达九亿亩之多，占我国全部播种面积的一半左右，是建国以来遭受到最大自然灾害的一年。但是，由于人民公社组织农民群众抗灾的结果，在九亿亩受灾面积中，成灾的面积只占三亿亩，在许多受灾较轻的地方仍然夺得了较好的收成，在受灾严重的地方也大大减轻了自然灾害为害的程度。这样大的自然灾害，假如发生在解放以前，必然是赤地千里；假如没有社会主义制度，假如没有人民公社，造成的损失也会比现在严重得多。成立只有两年时间的新的社会经济组织——人民公社，在同严重的自然灾害的斗争中更加巩固起来了。
    在国民经济各个部门的基本建设战线上，在交通运输和商业战线上，在文化教育战线上，今年也都继续取得了新的成就。今年全国出现了一个建立城市人民公社的高潮。全国已经建立了一千多个城市人民公社，把广大的家庭妇女组织到生产事业和社会福利事业中来，为发展生产和根本改造城市面貌创造了新的条件。
    摆在我们面前的任务，就是进一步展开以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动，争取在各个战线上取得更大的成就。就工业方面说，要保证完成和超额完成全国人民代表大会通过的工业生产计划，增产更多的钢、铁、钢材、煤炭和各种工业产品，并且为明年的生产建设作好准备。就农业方面说，当前的任务是贯彻实行党中央的关于全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的方针，要在对自然灾害的斗争取得巨大胜利的基础上，积极地、认真地做好秋收工作，不让一颗粮食、一个棉桃及其它农业作物的成果丢在地上。这就需要切实掌握收获时间，合理组织劳动，进行检查工作。同时，也要积极地、认真地做好秋耕冬耕工作，按照各种条件尽可能地扩大秋种的播种面积，积造质量更好数量更多的肥料，努力改善灌溉系统，力争明年获得一个比以往任何一年都更好的夏季丰收。
    我们前进的道路是宽广的，我们建设的前景是无限美好的。总路线、大跃进和人民公社的伟大生命力，已经越来越充分地显示出来。我国人民完全有可能争取在不到十年的时间内，在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国，争取提前两三年实现全国农业发展纲要，争取提前实现十二年科学发展规划，以便更快地把我们国家建设成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。在前进的道路上当然不会没有困难。由于我国原来是在帝国主义统治下的半殖民地半封建的国家，在经济上和科学技术上很落后，全国解放以来也只有十一年的建设时间，没有困难是不可设想的。但是，人们知道，中国人民和中国共产党从来没有在任何困难的面前低头，而且善于克服各种困难。我们的革命和建设事业，正是不断地克服困难而取得成就的。只要我国人民进一步加强团结，坚持鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的旗帜，充分发扬我们党的艰苦奋斗、脚踏实地、埋头苦干、发愤图强的优良的革命传统，依靠自己的双手，依靠自己的劳动，就一定能够战胜一切意外的困难，迅速地达到我们的伟大的目标，实现我们的美好的理想。
    在这建国十一周年的时候，我国人民不仅欢欣鼓舞地庆祝自己的胜利，并且对世界各国人民为自己的光明和幸福所进行的斗争，表示最热烈的同情和最崇高的敬意。
    在过去一年中，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加巩固和更加强大了。伟大的苏联人民在全面开展共产主义建设方面又取得了辉煌的成就，并且两次成功地发射了宇宙飞船，在最新科学技术方面把美国更远地抛在后面。亚洲和欧洲各兄弟国家的社会主义建设事业也蒸蒸日上。社会主义各国的和平外交政策，赢得了各国人民的广泛的支持，它们的国际威望和影响正在不断增长。社会主义各国人民有着共同的共产主义的伟大理想，为了实现这种理想，为了反对共同的敌人，他们之间的友谊是万古长青的，他们之间的团结决不是任何力量所能破坏的。
    在过去一年中，各国人民争取世界和平的斗争、争取和维护民族独立的斗争、争取民主和社会进步的斗争，出现了空前规模的新高涨。
    美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议和加剧冷战，使越来越多的人识破了它空谈“和平”、加紧扩军备战的阴谋。全世界人民看到，美帝国主义正在加强它的侵略性的军事集团，正在加强它的国外的军事基地，特别是武装西德和日本。因此，制止美帝国主义策动世界战争、保卫世界和平的运动，正在吸引着越来越广泛的人们参加。
    反帝国主义的民族民主运动的风暴，席卷亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲几个大陆。英勇的古巴人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的胜利的革命斗争，鼓舞着拉丁美洲和全世界一切受到美帝国主义侵略的国家的人民。日本人民反对美日军事同盟的全民性的持续斗争，打破了美国总统艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的计划，把日本反动派首脑之一岸信介推下了台。老挝、南朝鲜、越南南方、土耳其也爆发了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。
    英勇的阿尔及利亚人民坚持反对法国殖民统治者的神圣的民族解放战争，激发着整个非洲的被压迫民族的觉醒。在这个曾经被称为“沉寂大陆”的土地上，正沸腾着反殖民主义的伟大斗争。刚果人民反对比利时殖民统治者、特别是反对美帝国主义假借联合国名义进行侵略的斗争，赢得了全世界人民的广泛的同情和支持。
    帝国主义的老殖民体系已经土崩瓦解。美帝国主义推行的新殖民主义也正在受到越来越大的打击。
    美国和西欧各国的工人运动，一年来也在进一步地发展。大规模的罢工运动连续发生，有力地反击了垄断资本的进攻。
    资本主义世界的经济情况正在继续恶化。美国面临新的经济危机，它在世界经济中的地位正在削弱，而西德、英国、法国、日本等国的垄断资本正在竭力加强自己的地位，美帝国主义和其它帝国主义之间为重新划分势力范围的斗争，正在西欧、非洲、中近东、东南亚以至拉丁美洲等地紧张地展开着。帝国主义各国的内部困难和它们之间的矛盾，正在日益加剧。美帝国主义尽管拼命挣扎，力图挽回它的颓势，但是它的侵略政策和战争政策遭到全世界人民的反对，陷于日益孤立的地位。
    一年来国际形势的发展表明：社会主义力量、民族解放力量、和平民主力量进一步地压倒帝国主义力量、反动力量和战争力量，就是说，东风进一步地压倒西风。这种形势十分有利于世界人民为和平、民主、民族解放和社会主义的斗争，也十分有利于中国人民争取一个和平的国际环境，以便进一步地建设我们的祖国。
    中国政府和中国人民，一贯为和平事业进行着坚持不懈的斗争。我们支持苏联和其它社会主义国家争取裁军、停止核武器试验、通过谈判解决国际争端、和缓国际紧张局势的和平倡议和努力。中国人民热烈地支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争。我们认为，这些斗争也是对我国人民的有力的支持。我们一贯努力争取同各国建立和发展和平共处的关系，努力扩大亚非的和平地区。今年以来，我国同亚非国家之间的友好关系，在和平共处五项原则的基础上，获得了新的发展。我国先后同缅甸、尼泊尔、阿富汗、几内亚签订了友好和互不侵犯条约或者和平友好条约。今天将要签订的中缅边界条约，使中缅边界永远变成一条和平友好的边界，为亚洲国家之间的和平共处创立光辉的榜样。我国同拉丁美洲人民的友好关系，也有了巨大的发展。我国已经和古巴正式建交，从此，中古两国的友好合作、互相支持的关系，将进一步发展起来。不久以前，周恩来总理重申我国政府主张亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内，签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约，把这个地区建成为没有核武器的地区。这一主张，受到亚洲各国人民的普遍欢迎。中国政府和中国人民这种保卫世界和平的坚定的立场，得到全世界广大人民的支持。我们的朋友遍于全世界。今年来我国参加国庆观礼的外宾超过以往任何一年。
    我国人民不会忘记，美帝国主义仍然占领我国领土台湾，并且不断地对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。我国人民一定要解放台湾，坚决反对美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策。美帝国主义企图采用各种卑鄙的手法孤立新中国的阴谋，是永远达不到目的的。我们深信，只要全世界人民充分利用当前的大好形势，加强各国人民为争取和维护世界和平、民族独立、社会进步和社会主义事业的斗争，结成广泛的反对帝国主义的统一战线，就一定能够击败以美国为首的帝国主义集团的侵略政策和战争政策，实现保卫世界和平的伟大任务。
    今天，我国人民怀着无限的喜悦进入建国的第十二年。在过去的短短的十一年中，中国发生了翻天复地的变化，世界形势也发生了更有利于和平和社会主义的变化。我们一天天地好起来，敌人一天天地烂下去。让我们在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的旗帜，为尽快地把我国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家，并且同全世界人民一道，为击败以美帝国主义为首的侵略和战争势力，保卫世界和平而奋斗！
