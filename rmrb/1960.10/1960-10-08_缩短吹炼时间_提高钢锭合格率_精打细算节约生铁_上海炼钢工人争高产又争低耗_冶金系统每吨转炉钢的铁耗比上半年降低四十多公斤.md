Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th - Shanghai's iron and steel front workers are tightly grasping key measures to ensure high yield, high quality, and low consumption. In recent months, not only has steel production risen every ten days, and quality has generally improved, but also the consumption of pig iron per ton of steel has been further reduced. According to statistics from relevant departments, the iron consumption per ton of converter steel in the city's metallurgical system in August decreased by seven kilograms compared with the average of the first half of the year, and in the first two ten-day periods of September, it decreased by forty kilograms compared with August. In addition, a number of advanced units in saving pig iron, such as the No. 2 Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 and the Open Hearth Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, have emerged.

Reducing iron consumption plays an important role in fulfilling and overfulfilling this year's steel production plan. Calculated from the iron consumption level reached in September compared with the first half of the year, several thousand more tons of high-quality steel can be produced this month from the reduction of iron consumption alone. While mobilizing the masses to focus on steel production and quality, Shanghai's steel plants pay attention to regularly educating employees about saving pig iron. In order to achieve the goal of using less pig iron and producing more good steel, in addition to regularly collecting scraps and waste iron mixed in steel slag and iron slag and scattered on the workshop floor and sending them to the furnace to make steel, workers in each steelmaking workshop also further carry out various competitions to reduce iron consumption by carefully calculating accounts and finding key points. The employees of the No. 2 Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, which has always had relatively low iron consumption, carefully calculated that if the smelting time of each furnace of steel in the converter is shortened by one minute, the current iron consumption per ton of steel can be reduced by eight to ten kilograms, and at the same time, the production and quality of steel can also be improved. After finding the key to increasing production and saving, everyone was very motivated. At the production increase and savings conference held on September 19, the entire workshop further launched a competition between shifts and furnaces to see who had the shortest smelting time and the least iron water loss. The workers operated conscientiously, chasing each other, so that the average smelting time of each furnace of steel in the entire workshop was shortened from twenty to twenty-one minutes to nineteen to twenty minutes, and the fastest No. 1 converter had an average smelting time of about eighteen minutes per furnace of steel.

Improving the acceptance rate of steel is also an important key to striving for high yield, high quality, and low consumption. In order to further improve the acceptance rate, each steelmaking workshop has launched a "one hundred furnace zero waste steel" competition, and on this basis, organized a one-stop collaborative competition from the stockyard, iron smelting furnace, converter, pouring to finishing. Workers of all types of work cooperated sincerely, carefully guarded the checkpoints, and did not allow molten iron and molten steel to leak from their hands. In order to ensure that the converter furnaces produce good steel, workers on the iron smelting furnace used methods such as increasing the hot air temperature, frequently ventilating the tuyere, and "eating coarse grains finely" to increase the desulfurization efficiency of the iron smelting furnace from 60% to about 70%. In order to pour all the molten steel into ingots as much as possible, workers at the steel pouring plant of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 sent people to measure the height of molten steel and slag in the steel ladle from a high place non-stop when pouring each furnace of steel, and notified the steel pouring workers to control the operation. Therefore, the amount of residual molten steel has dropped from more than ten kilograms per ton of steel last year to several kilograms this year, and less than one kilogram in the most advanced group. With the cooperation of all parties, the acceptance rate of converter steel in the city's metallurgical system increased from 94.88% in July to 95.53% in August, and reached 97.92% in the first ten days of September.

In carrying out the mass competition to reduce iron consumption, many steelmaking workshops have strengthened the leadership of this work. Workshop leaders and workers conducted experiments and research together to improve desulfurization effect and shorten smelting time, and launched workers to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. With the support of leading cadres, workers in the open-hearth workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 used iron oxide scale sprayed out from the converter smelting instead of ore to make steel. Since the beginning of this year, more than 2,000 tons of iron oxide scale have been used and made into good steel in the open-hearth furnace. Some workshops also held anti-waste exhibitions, so that employees were educated and found ways to increase production and save at the exhibition.

    缩短吹炼时间　提高钢锭合格率　精打细算节约生铁
    上海炼钢工人争高产又争低耗
    冶金系统每吨转炉钢的铁耗比上半年降低四十多公斤
    新华社上海7日电　上海钢铁战线职工紧抓各项保证高产、优质、低耗的关键性措施，几个月来不仅钢产量旬旬上升，质量普遍提高，而且进一步降低了每吨钢的生铁耗用量，据有关部门统计，市冶金系统每吨转炉钢的铁耗，8月份比上半年平均降低七公斤，9月上中两旬又比8月份降低四十公斤，并且出现了上钢三厂第二转炉车间和上钢一厂平炉车间等一批节约生铁的先进单位。
    降低铁耗对完成和超额完成今年钢的生产计划，有重要作用。以9月份达到的铁耗水平同上半年比较计算，这个月中仅从降低铁耗方面，就可以多炼出好几千吨优质钢。上海各钢铁厂在发动群众大抓钢产量和质量的同时，注意经常对职工进行节约生铁的教育。为了实现少用生铁、多炼好钢这个目标，各炼钢车间的工人除经常注意把混在钢渣、铁渣里和散落在车间场地上的废钢、废铁一块块收集起来送到炉子里去炼钢以外，并且通过算细账、找关键，进一步开展降低铁耗的各项竞赛活动。铁耗一直比较低的上钢三厂第二转炉车间职工仔细地算了一笔细账，如果转炉每炉钢的吹炼时间缩短一分钟，目前每吨钢的铁耗可以降低八到十公斤，同时还可以提高钢的产量和质量。增产节约的关键找到以后，大家干劲很大，在9月19日召开的增产节约大会上，全车间进一步掀起了一个班与班、炉与炉之间比谁吹炼时间最短、铁水吹损最少的竞赛。工人们认真操作，你追我赶，使全车间每炉钢的平均吹炼时间由二十到二十一分钟缩短到十九到二十分钟，最快的一号转炉平均每炉钢的吹炼时间在十八分钟左右。
    提高钢的合格率，也是一个争取高产、优质、低耗的重要关键。为了进一步提高合格率，各炼钢车间纷纷开展了“百炉无废钢”竞赛，并且在这个基础上，组织了从料场、化铁炉、转炉、浇注到整理的一条龙协作竞赛。各工种工人齐心协力，认真守住关口，不让铁水、钢水从自己手里漏掉。为保证转炉炉炉炼出好钢，化铁炉上的工人用提高热风温度，勤通风眼和粗粮细吃等办法、使化铁炉脱硫效率从60％提高到70％左右。为了尽可能把所有钢水都浇注成锭，上钢三厂浇钢工场的工人，浇注每一炉钢的时候，都派人从高处一刻不停地用棒测量钢包里的钢水和渣子的高度，通知浇钢工控制操作。因此，浇余钢水的数量从去年每吨钢的十多公斤，下降到今年的几公斤，最先进的小组不到一公斤。在各方面协作配合下，市冶金系统转炉钢的合格率，从7月份的94.88％提高到8月份的95.53％，9月上旬更达到97.92％。
    在开展群众性的降低铁耗竞赛中，许多炼钢车间都加强了对这项工作的领导。车间领导干部同工人群众一起进行提高去硫效果、缩短吹炼时间等的试验研究工作，并发动工人群众大闹技术革新和技术革命。上钢一厂平炉车间在领导干部的支持下，工人们用转炉吹炼中喷出来的氧化铁屑代替矿石炼钢，今年以来，使用了二千多吨氧化铁屑，都在平炉里炼成了好钢。有些车间还举办反浪费展览会，使职工群众在展览会上受到教育和找到增产节约的办法。
