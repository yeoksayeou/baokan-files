    Your Excellency,
    I have the honor and pleasure to receive the telegram from the Government of the People's Republic of China, thanking the Government of Mali for recognizing the People's Republic of China, and in turn, recognizing the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of Mali.
    I am pleased to take this opportunity to express the congratulations and sincere gratitude of the people and government of the Republic of Mali to the heroic Chinese people and the Chinese government, who are steadfastly carrying out the socialist construction of their country.
    The Government of the Republic of Mali, faithful to its policy of cooperating with all peaceful countries on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, welcomes the decision of the Chinese People's Government on the establishing of diplomatic relations between our two countries. I am deeply convinced that the friendly relations that are about to be established between our two countries will be strengthened, and will guide our two peoples to achieve new successes in the struggle against imperialism, for the maintenance of peace, and for the development of economic and social progress. I respectfully request Your Excellency to accept my highest regards.
