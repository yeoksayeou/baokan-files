(Dispatch from Wuhan, October 20th) The Daye Steel Plant has widely applied new technologies and experiences for eliminating sulfur in the production increase and economy campaign, achieving an all-round leap forward in production. The average daily steel production level of the entire plant in September increased by 20.23% compared to August, and the first half of October increased by 28.85% compared to the same period in September; steel quality and the output rate according to variety have also greatly improved.

High sulfur content in pig iron has been a major key issue in Daye Steel Plant's production since the second quarter. Under the leadership of the plant's Party Committee, the plant's workers have created many new technologies and experiences for sulfur removal, which have played a significant role in improving desulfurization efficiency and achieving high-quality, high-yield, and multi-variety production. However, these new technologies and experiences were previously not systematic or complete enough, and were not widely adopted throughout the plant. After the launch of the production increase and economy campaign in August, the plant established a New Technology and New Experience Collation and Promotion Office, widely adopting the "three-way combination" method of cadres, workers, and technical personnel to summarize, evaluate, supplement, and integrate the effective new technologies and experiences for sulfur removal from the previous technical innovation and technical revolution movement, making them more complete and systematic, and vigorously promoting them throughout the plant. They summarized the thirteen new technologies adopted by the iron melting furnace workers, such as large slag volume, high alkalinity, and full wind pressure, and incorporated them into the production operating procedures, increasing the desulfurization efficiency from 30% in the past to about 70%. Open hearth furnace workers, based on summarizing previous experience, further revised and supplemented eleven key operating points such as high-temperature furnace repair, high-temperature charging, high-temperature melting, and high-temperature tapping, and vigorously promoted the new experience of large-scale slag making and early slag removal, which not only improved the desulfurization efficiency but also greatly shortened the smelting time. In September, the average smelting time per furnace of steel in the entire plant was greatly shortened compared to August, and the first ten days of October were more than fifty minutes shorter than September. After the converter workers promoted the advanced operating experience of their own plant and other plants, the output and quality of converter steel also improved. Pig iron consumption per ton of steel decreased by 101 kilograms. At the same time, the plant also carried out fundamental technical transformation of the equipment related to sulfur elimination. Focusing on the iron melting furnace, they organized various forces to install eight high-pressure blowers for the iron melting furnace in less than a month, universally changing all eight iron melting furnaces in the plant from acidic and neutral to alkaline, and improving the tuyeres of the iron melting furnace, greatly improving the desulfurization efficiency and melting rate of the iron melting furnace, creating favorable conditions for shortening the smelting time of open hearth furnaces and converters and achieving high-quality and high-yield.

In consolidating, promoting, and improving existing innovation achievements, leading cadres at all levels generally went deep into the front line, focusing on ideology and key points. The Party Branch Secretary of the First Steelmaking Department went deep into the iron melting furnace, had individual heart-to-heart talks with the workers, and found that some workers had various ideological concerns about changing the iron melting furnace from acidic to alkaline. Some were afraid that alkaline iron melting furnaces would have a short lifespan and low output, some were afraid that they would be difficult to operate, and the raw material and furnace building workers were afraid that the workload would be large and the supply of raw materials and furnace building materials would not keep up, and so on. In response to these ideological problems, the Party organization raised questions such as where should sulfur be eliminated, and how can the iron melting furnace more effectively eliminate sulfur, and organized everyone to debate, analyze, and compare. Through discussion, everyone realized that it takes two hours to remove 0.1% of sulfur in the open hearth furnace, while it only takes more than ten minutes in the iron melting furnace. Therefore, to shorten the smelting time of the open hearth furnace, the vast majority of the sulfur must be eliminated in the iron melting furnace, and to improve the desulfurization efficiency of the iron melting furnace, it is necessary to change the iron melting furnace from acidic to alkaline. They focused on Iron Melting Furnace No. 3 and changed this iron melting furnace from neutral to alkaline. As a result, the desulfurization efficiency of this iron melting furnace in the first cycle after the transformation increased from 30% in the past to 70%, reaching a maximum of 92%. The melting rate increased from eight tons per hour in the past to eleven tons, and the furnace age was also extended by nearly one time. This further dispelled people's various concerns about changing to an alkaline iron melting furnace, so all the iron melting furnaces in the plant were quickly changed from acidic to alkaline. After the leading cadres went deep into the production front line, they also practically solved many specific problems in production.

In order to continuously enrich and develop the achievements of technical innovation and technical revolution, the plant also launched a mass technical performance competition, closely combining the summary, consolidation, and improvement of technical innovation achievements with labor emulation.

(Dispatch from Kunming, October 20th) The Second Workshop of the Steelmaking Plant of Kunming Iron and Steel Company has taken various measures to vigorously improve the quality of converter steel, achieving an all-round victory of both increasing steel production and saving pig iron. The average qualification rate of steel in the entire workshop in the third quarter reached 97%. Due to the improvement of quality, not only has the output of qualified steel greatly increased, but the consumption of pig iron per ton of steel has also decreased by more than 200 kilograms compared to the second quarter.

The Second Steelmaking Workshop is a new workshop that was put into production last year. In the second quarter of this year, due to the increased sulfur content of the pig iron used for steelmaking, there was a period of high scrap rate and high pig iron consumption. In order to break through this key, the leading cadres of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee Working Group and Kunming Iron and Steel Company and the Steelmaking Plant went deep into the workshop, personally operating and observing in front of the furnace, while studying the causes of scrap with the workers. After a period of practice and investigation, they found that the main reason for the high scrap rate was "illness enters through the mouth." Originally, the use of acidic converters to make steel mainly relied on batching in the iron melting furnace, but the iron melting furnace in this workshop did not strictly implement the batching system, taking whatever was available, so the quality of the steel was good one moment and bad the next. After finding this weak link, they worked with the workers to study prevention methods. Based on the opinions of veteran workers and with reference to the experience of other places, they implemented a "three-stage desulfurization" method, that is, first adding limestone for desulfurization in the iron melting furnace, second adding soda for desulfurization in the molten iron ladle, and third adding limestone or soda for desulfurization in the steel ladle after the converter taps steel. The test results showed that this could desulfurize 30% to 40%, and qualified steel could be made even with pig iron containing as much as 0.2% sulfur.

After the factory leaders summarized this experience, they immediately helped the workshop's Party Branch and the major class branches to carry out in-depth and meticulous ideological work among the workers, inspiring the revolutionary ambition of all the workers. Everyone offered suggestions and determined to make good steel from bad iron. The major classes first seized the iron melting furnace as the key, with the branch secretary and duty director personally guarding the iron melting furnace to help the batching personnel strictly implement the batching system. Second, the three shifts of workers unified the operation and established a post responsibility system. In the past, everyone could rock the furnace, but now a dedicated person is fixed to rock the furnace, and production is uniformly directed by the furnace supervisor. Third, the handover system and the preparation work before production were further strengthened. Before starting work, the branch secretaries and duty directors of the major classes first went to the pig iron supply station to understand the quantity and quality of the pig iron, then went to the iron melting furnace to understand the desulfurization situation of the previous shift, and then went to the converter to understand the blowing situation of the previous shift. They deployed production based on these situations when starting work, and took timely measures; they also actively explained the situation to the incoming shift when leaving work, so that each shift knew the enemy and themselves, and had a clear understanding of the situation. Fourth, the analysis and research work on quality was strengthened. The converter work sections of the major classes established quality analysis and research groups. When problems were found in the operation, they immediately held furnace-side meetings to study and adopt countermeasures in a timely manner.

In the process of implementing these measures, the workshop's Party Branch organized the workers of the major classes to launch a "Double Hundred" competition (that is, 100 tons of steel per class, 100% qualification rate). This competition was first initiated by the Second Class. In July, due to the implementation of the above measures, this class achieved a 100% qualification rate for eight days, and as a result, completed the state plan four days ahead of schedule, with output increasing by 87% compared to June. The workshop's Party Branch promptly summarized the experience of the Second Class, and in August organized them to further propose "Double Hundred" conditions and launched a competition with the other two classes. Because the competition goals were clear, comparable, and based on the major classes, it quickly achieved significant results. In August, the qualification rate of steel in the entire workshop increased to 98%, and the output exceeded the state plan by 30%. With the deepening of the competition, the quality and output of steel continued to rise. As of October 14, the Third Class had continuously blown 1,227 furnaces without scrap, the First Class had also continuously blown 952 furnaces without scrap, and the Second Class had achieved a 100% qualification rate for eleven days in the first twelve days of October.

    平炉冶炼时间缩短，转炉铁耗下降，钢产量逐月上升，质量有很大提高
    昆明钢铁公司炼钢厂第二车间实行三次脱硫法，用高硫铁炼出合格钢
    本报武汉20日电　大冶钢厂在增产节约运动中，广泛应用消灭硫磺的新技术和新经验，生产实现全面跃进。全厂9月份钢的平均日产水平比8月份提高了20.23％，10月上半月又比9月同期提高了28.85％；钢的质量和按品种出钢率也都有很大提高。
    生铁含硫高是大冶钢厂第二季度以来生产上的一个重大关键。全厂职工在厂党委领导之下，也曾创造了许多灭硫的新技术和新经验，对提高脱硫效率、实现优质高产多品种起了很大作用。但是，这些新技术和新经验以前还不够系统不够完善，也没有在全厂范围内广泛地采用。8月份开展增产节约运动以后，全厂成立了新技术新经验整理、推广办公室，广泛地采取干部、工人、技术人员三结合的办法，将前段技术革新和技术革命运动中灭硫行之有效的新技术和新经验，进行总结、鉴定、补充和配套，使之更加完善和系统化，并在全厂大力推广。他们总结了化铁炉工人所采取的大渣量、高碱度、全风足压等十三条新技术，并纳入生产操作规程，使脱硫效率由过去的30％提高到70％左右。平炉工人在总结前段经验的基础上，进一步修订和补充了高温补炉、高温进料、高温熔化、高温出钢等十一条操作要点，大力推广了大量造渣、提前放渣的新经验，不仅提高了脱硫效率，而且大大地缩短了冶炼时间。9月份全厂平炉平均每炉钢的冶炼时间比8月份大大缩短，10月上旬又比9月份缩短了五十多分钟。转炉工人推广了本厂和外厂的先进操作经验以后，转炉钢的产量、质量也都有提高。每吨钢的生铁消耗降低了一百零一公斤。在这同时，这个厂还对有关消灭硫的设备进行了根本性的技术改造。他们以化铁炉为重点，组织各方面的力量，在不到一个月的时间内，为化铁炉安装了八台高压鼓风机，将全厂八座化铁炉，普遍由酸性、中性改成了碱性，改进了化铁炉风眼，大大地提高了化铁炉的脱硫效率和熔化率，为平炉、转炉缩短冶炼时间实现优质高产，创造了良好的条件。
    在巩固、推广和提高已有革新成果中，各级领导干部普遍深入第一线，抓思想，抓关键。第一炼钢部党总支书记深入化铁炉，和工人个别谈心，发现部分工人对化铁炉由酸性改为碱性有种种思想顾虑，有的怕碱性化铁炉寿命短、产量低，有的怕不好操作，原料和砌炉工人怕工作量大，原料和砌炉供应跟不上等等。针对这些思想问题，党组织提出应该把硫磺消灭在哪里，化铁炉怎样更有效地消灭硫磺等问题，组织大家辩论、分析、比较。通过讨论使大家认识到：在平炉内去掉0.1％的硫磺需要两个小时，而在化铁炉内只需十多分钟，因此，要缩短平炉的冶炼时间，必须把绝大部分的硫磺消灭在化铁炉内，而提高化铁炉的脱硫效率，又必须将化铁炉由酸性改为碱性的。他们又以三号化铁炉为重点，将这座化铁炉由中性改为碱性。结果，这座化铁炉在改造后的第一个周期中，脱硫效率就由过去的30％提高到70％，最高达到92％。熔化率由过去每小时八吨提高到十一吨，炉龄也比过去延长了将近一倍。这样，就进一步解除了人们怕改为碱性化铁炉的种种顾虑，从而全厂化铁炉很快都由酸性改成了碱性。领导干部深入生产第一线后，还踏踏实实地解决了不少生产中的具体问题。
    为了使技术革新和技术革命成果得到不断丰富和发展，这个厂还发动群众大搞技术表演赛，使技术革新成果的总结巩固、提高工作同劳动竞赛紧密地结合了起来。
    本报昆明20日电　昆明钢铁公司炼钢厂第二车间采取各种措施狠抓转炉钢质量，获得了既增产钢又节约生铁的全面胜利。全车间第三季度钢的平均合格率达97％。由于提高了质量，不仅大大增加了合格钢的产量，每吨钢的生铁消耗量也比第二季度减少了两百多公斤。
    第二炼钢车间是去年投入生产的新车间。今年第二季度由于炼钢所用生铁含硫量提高，一度出现废品率高、生铁消耗多的情况。为了突破这一关键，当时，中共云南省委工作团和昆明钢铁公司、炼钢厂的领导干部都深入到这个车间，一边在炉前亲自操作、观察，一边同工人研究产生废品的原因。经过一段时间的实践和调查研究，他们发现废品多的主要原因是“病从口入”。原来用酸性转炉炼钢主要依靠在化铁炉中配料，而这个车间的化铁炉执行配料制度并不严格，来啥吃啥，因此钢的质量忽而好忽而坏。找出这个薄弱环节以后，他们又同工人一起研究防止办法，根据老工人的意见和参照外地的经验，实行了“三次脱硫”的办法，即一次在化铁炉内加石灰石脱硫，二次在铁水包里加苏打脱硫，三次等转炉出钢后，在钢包中加石灰石或苏打脱硫。试验结果，这样可以脱硫30％到40％，用含硫高达0.2％的生铁也炼成了合格钢。
    工厂领导总结了这一经验以后，立即帮助车间党总支和各大班支部，在职工中进行了深入细致的思想工作，鼓起了全体职工的革命雄心壮志，大家出谋献策，决心要让坏铁炼出好钢。各大班首先抓住了化铁炉这个关键，由支部书记和值班主任亲自把守化铁炉，帮助配料人员严格执行配料制度。其次，三班工人都统一了操作，建立了岗位责任制。过去人人可以摇炉，现在固定了专人摇炉，生产由炉司统一指挥。第三，进一步加强了交接班制度和生产前的准备工作，各大班的支部书记和值班主任，在上班以前都先到生铁供应站去，了解生铁的数量和质量，再到化铁炉上了解上一班脱硫的情况，然后再到转炉上了解上班的吹炼情况。上班时就根据这些情况，部署生产，及时采取措施；下班时也主动把情况交代给接班的，使每个班都作到了知己知彼，心中有数。第四，加强对质量的分析研究工作，各大班的转炉工段都成立了质量分析研究小组，在操作中发现问题，立即举行炉旁会议，及时研究，采取对策。
    在贯彻执行这些措施的过程中，车间党总支组织各大班职工开展了“双百”竞赛（即班产百吨钢，合格率100％）。这个竞赛首先由第二大班发起。7月份这个大班由于贯彻了上述措施，有八天合格率达到100％，结果提前四天完成了国家计划，产量比6月份提高了87％。车间党总支及时总结了第二大班的经验，并在8月份里组织他们进一步提出“双百”条件，向其它两个大班开展竞赛。由于竞赛的目标明确，可比性强，又以大班作为基础，很快就收到了显著效果。8月份全车间钢的合格率提高到98％，产量超过国家计划30％。随着竞赛的深入发展，钢的质量与产量都不断上升，到10月14日止，第三大班已连续吹炼一千二百二十七炉无废品，第一大班也连续吹炼九百五十二炉无废品，第二大班在10月份的前十二天中，有十一天合格率达到100％。
