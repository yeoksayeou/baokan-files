    Correctly Understand Soil and Transform Soil
    Xiong Yi
    "Soil" is the foundation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. "All things grow from the soil." Only with soil can crops be planted. If the character "soil" is well implemented, the other seven characters will play a greater role.
    In their production practice, Chinese working farmers have long recognized that soil can be improved through human production labor, and soil fertility can be continuously improved. Sayings such as "If people are diligent, the land won't be lazy," and "People don't deceive the land, and the land doesn't deceive people" express the correct understanding of soil by Chinese farmers. However, bourgeois soil scientists under the reactionary rule in the past did not hold this view. They believed that soil was merely a naturally formed object, static and unchanging, thus concluding that humans were powerless to do anything about soil and could not change or improve soil fertility. They mistakenly divided soil science into theoretical soil science and applied soil science, separating theory from practice. The agricultural chemistry school regarded soil as a storage room for inorganic nutrients for plants, while the agricultural geology school regarded soil as a geological formation. They also used metaphysical viewpoints to create the anti-scientific "law of diminishing soil fertility" and promoted the reactionary Malthusian theory of population, arguing that after cultivation, soil fertility would decrease more and more. According to this absurd view, agricultural output would decrease more and more, and humanity would become increasingly impoverished. This argument sounds ridiculous now, but in the past, it constrained people's thinking and hindered the development of soil science.
    The viewpoint of soil genesis is the correct view of soil. This viewpoint holds that: soil is not static but dynamic and developing; soil is not isolated but closely related to the natural environment and human activities. Soil can develop in a good direction or a bad direction. What we usually call this soil or that soil is only a static moment in the unified movement process of soil. Soil science with a genetic perspective must understand the laws of soil movement, change, and development, so as to revolutionize and transform the soil, and closely integrate the understanding of soil with the transformation of soil. It is not correct genetics to only pay attention to the laws of soil development without paying attention to transformation; it is not complete genetics to only consider the laws of soil development caused by natural factors without studying the changes in soil caused by human labor.
    Soil is the loose layer on the surface of the land that can grow plants. It contains different components and quantities of solids, liquids, and gases, which are closely connected with each other to form a whole. The minerals in the soil solid include particles of different sizes and crystalline salts. Among them, the larger sand particles are mainly composed of quartz, which has no direct significance for plant nutrition, but is very important for the drainage and ventilation performance of the soil. The mineral composition of smaller silt and clay particles is very complex, containing various plant nutrient elements. These elements are mostly insoluble in water and difficult for plants to absorb directly. Only after they become soluble compounds can they be absorbed by plants. In addition to minerals, the solid in the soil also contains 1%-5% of organic matter. Although the content is not much, it has a great impact on the properties of the soil. Organic matter refers to the remains of animals and plants in the soil, which are formed by biochemical action, especially through the action of microorganisms, into humus. Soil clay particles and soil humus are closely combined to form a soil absorption complex. The surface of the complex adsorbs many nutrients that can be directly absorbed and utilized by plants, which is of great importance to soil fertility.
    The content and composition of liquids in the soil vary. When water enters the soil, it leaches soluble substances from the soil and transforms into soil solution. Some soil solutions are acidic, and some are alkaline. The soil solution contains nutrients to meet the needs of crop growth, but if the salt content is too high, it will also affect crop growth.
    The amount of gas in the soil depends on the soil porosity and water content. Deep plowing can promote the development of crop roots, because after deep plowing, the soil is loose and the pores increase. Generally, paddy fields have less air due to the high water content in the soil; the method of baking the field can increase the air in the soil. When the air in the soil increases and the oxidation effect is strengthened, it can promote the release of nutrients for crop absorption. If the soil is often soaked in water, not only will the air decrease, but also gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen will be produced. If these gases accumulate too much, they will be detrimental to crop growth and even cause poisoning.
    In the soil, whether it is between solid, liquid, and gas, between organic and inorganic matter, or between living and non-living matter, they are all interconnected and mutually constrained, and are affected by the external environment. The formation process of soil is the unified process of many contradictions within the soil. These contradictions are: the synthesis and decomposition of organic compounds, the synthesis and decomposition of minerals, the synthesis and separation of organic-inorganic complexes, the acquisition and loss of water and air, the absorption and dissipation of heat energy, and so on. Among them, the synthesis and decomposition of organic matter is the characteristic that distinguishes soil from weathered crust. These contradictions are the internal causes of soil movement and development. Due to the diversity of internal contradictions in the soil and the complexity of the external environment, the soils formed are also diverse, and their movement directions and speeds are also different. Various soils do not exist in isolation but are interconnected and mutually influential; their occurrence and movement are not carried out in isolation but are an inseparable chain from one soil to another. If people understand the contradictions in the soil and understand the laws of soil movement and development, they can guide the soil movement in a direction that is beneficial to people, that is, in the direction of increasing soil fertility.
    The factors affecting soil movement and development include natural conditions and human production labor. Natural conditions include climate, biology, topography, parent material, and hydrological conditions, etc., which comprehensively affect the movement and development of soil, with biological action being the main factor. Human production labor has essential differences from the impact of general natural conditions on soil, and the changes it causes in the soil are also greater. The role of human production labor on soil is different from general biological activities. Humans utilize and improve soil in a planned and purposeful way. After the soil is cultivated by humans, natural plants are replaced by crops, and new changes will occur. There are many examples of human labor transforming soil: reclamation of wasteland, irrigation of dry land, silt deposition in plains, ditching and drainage of low-lying and saline-alkali land, construction of terraces, planting of rice, fixation of sand dunes, and construction of protective forest belts, etc. The construction of terraces is a soil improvement method with Chinese characteristics, which not only prevents soil erosion but also turns uncultivable slopes into fertile fields and thin land into thick soil. Deep plowing, fertilization, and soil replacement are also inherent soil improvement methods in our country. Add some sand to clay that is too sticky, and knead some mud into sand that is too loose. Replacing part or all of the bad soil with good soil not only changes the composition of the soil but also changes the properties of the soil and accelerates soil maturation. Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, Guan Town Commune, used the soil replacement method to change sandy soil into yellow sandy soil, and the wheat yield per mu increased from seventy catties to two hundred and seventy catties. Xia Tun Brigade in Miyun, Beijing, used manure-rich soil to change sandy land into two-blend soil, and the wheat yield per mu increased from fifty catties to three or four hundred catties, with a maximum of seven hundred catties. Farmers in Suzhou, Jiangsu, used organic fertilizer to transform white soil into gray soil, and the cultivated soil layer increased from three inches to eight inches, so that the rice yield per mu increased from two hundred catties to seven hundred catties. Human production labor has greatly changed the external environment of the soil and the process of soil movement, so that the soil develops in a direction that is beneficial to people. The facts of high agricultural yields since the Great Leap Forward have pointed out to people that under the socialist system, mankind can transform the soil at high speed through labor and continuously improve soil fertility.
    Soil fertility is a comprehensive manifestation of various soil characteristics. Soil not only provides crops with the water, nutrients, and other living conditions needed for growth, but more importantly, it can regulate these living conditions to meet the different needs of crops at different growth stages, allowing crops to "eat their fill, drink their fill, and live comfortably." According to this view, fertile soil not only contains rich nutrients and water but also has the ability to regulate the living conditions required for plant growth. The emergence of these characteristics is closely related to the synthesis and decomposition of organic matter in the soil. This fully illustrates the importance of organic matter in soil fertility. Chinese farmers have a deep understanding of this, believing that "soil and fertilizer integration" is an important link in cultivating highly fertile soil. According to our preliminary summary, after soil and fertilizer are integrated, they can both store water and retain fertilizer, and be drought-resistant and flood-resistant. The content of organic matter and nitrogen increases, phosphorus fixation decreases, microbial activity is vigorous, and the molecules of humus increase, and the functional groups also increase. In dry land, oily soil is the most fertile soil, and its characteristics are expressed as "thick, soft, black, oily, and cohesive," that is, the soil layer is thick, the soil color is dark, it looks oily, it is soft and gentle to the touch, and the soil particles cluster around the roots of the crop when pulled out and do not disperse. This is the sign of fertile soil in dry land. Systematically summarizing the experience of farmers will not only promote the current agricultural production but also lead to a revolutionary development of soil science in our country.
    Labor-oriented soil transformation is to give full play to human subjective initiative and transform soil according to human needs. Directional soil transformation is not a blind action but a purposeful and planned work. To directionally transform soil, we must use the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, grasp the laws of soil movement and development, and specifically analyze the contradictions in the soil. Ignoring the analysis and research of soil contradictions will lead to subjective errors.
    Soil transformation is not for the sake of transformation but for the sake of improving agricultural production. Therefore, the scope of soil transformation should be expanded. In the past, our understanding of soil transformation was very small, limited to diseased, non-productive, or soils with extremely low productivity, such as saline-alkali land, sandy land, low-lying land, and red soil. This is not enough. We should not only cure diseased soils and improve their fertility, and change bad land into good fields, but also change general fields into high-yield fields, and even continuously improve high-yield fields to make them even more productive. Soil transformation is endless, and there are no fixed specifications. Soil is continuously transformed, and crop yields are continuously increased. This is our goal of transforming soil. Of course, soil transformation is subject to social and economic conditions and the level of science and technology, etc. Under different time and space conditions, the requirements for soil transformation are also limited. If the conditions change and the requirements are raised, the transformation of the soil will continue to develop.
    We want to transform soil directionally, but we do not want to transform all soils into the same kind of soil with one measure. Various soils have different characteristics, and the natural conditions in various regions are also different. The objective laws of soil development are also inconsistent. It is difficult, unreasonable, and unnecessary to transform different soils into one kind of soil. If we understand the climate and terrain, master the growth habits of crops, and control fertilizer and water measures according to the specific situation, different soils can also achieve high yields. Of course, doing so requires a higher level of agricultural cultivation technology and cannot be achieved under general cultivation conditions. To achieve large-scale high yields and stable harvests of crops, the most appropriate way is to cultivate fertile soil.
    Currently, under the call of the Party to vigorously develop agriculture and food production, the masses of farmers are enthusiastically engaged in high-yield squares and gardenization, and transforming soil. These are all favorable conditions for us to transform soil and develop soil science. We firmly believe that as long as we move forward following the teachings of the Party, we will surely continue to achieve new and greater achievements.

    正确地认识土壤和改造土壤
    熊毅
    “土”是农业“八字宪法”的基础。“万物土中生”，有了土壤，才能种植作物。“土”字贯彻得好，其他七个字发挥的作用就更大。
    我国劳动农民在生产实践中，早就认识到土壤可以通过人类的生产劳动得到改良，土壤肥力可以不断提高。“人勤地不懒”、“人不哄地，地不哄人”等等说法，就表现了我国农民对土壤的正确认识。但是，过去在反动统治下的资产阶级土壤学家却不是这样看法。他们认为土壤只是自然形成物，是静止不变的，因而得出人类对土壤无能为力，不可能改变土壤和提高土壤肥力的结论。他们错误地把土壤学分为理论土壤学和实用土壤学两类，使理论脱离实践。农业化学派把土壤看作植物无机营养物质的储藏室，农业地质学派则把土壤当作地质形成物。他们还以形而上学的观点，制造反科学的“土壤肥力递减律”，宣扬反动的马尔萨斯人口论，认为土壤经过种植，肥力会愈来愈低。按照这种荒谬的观点，农业产量将愈来愈低，人类将愈来愈贫困。这种论点现在听来十分可笑，可是它在过去一个时期内却约束着人们的思路，妨碍了土壤科学的发展。
    土壤发生学的观点，是对土壤的认识的正确观点。这一观点认为：土壤不是静止的，而是运动发展的；土壤不是孤立的，而是和自然环境、人为活动密切联系的。土壤可以向好的方向发展，也可以向坏的方向发展。我们平时所说的这种土壤或那种土壤，只是土壤统一运动过程中的静止瞬息。具有发生学观点的土壤学，要了解土壤的运动变化和发展规律，从而革命地改造土壤，把认识土壤和改造土壤紧密结合起来。只注意土壤发展规律而不注意改造，不是正确的发生学；只考虑自然因素引起的土壤发展规律，而不研究人类劳动所引起的土壤的变化，也不是完整的发生学。
    土壤是陆地表面能够生长植物的疏松层。它含有不同成份和数量的固体、液体和气体，三者彼此紧密联系，形成一个整体。土壤固体中的矿物质，包括不同大小的颗粒和结晶态盐类，其中颗粒较大的砂粒成分主要是石英，它对植物营养虽无直接意义，但对土壤的排水通气性能却十分重要。颗粒较小的粉砂粒和粘粒的矿物成分很复杂，含有各种植物营养元素，这些元素多不溶解于水，难以被植物直接吸收，只有变成溶解性的化合物后，才能被植物吸收。土壤中的固体，除矿物质外，还有1％—5％的有机质，含量虽然不多，但对土壤的性质影响很大。有机质就是指土壤中的动植物遗体，经过生物化学作用，尤其是经过微生物的作用所形成的腐殖质。土壤粘粒和土壤腐殖质紧密结合在一起，形成土壤吸收性复合体，复合体表面吸附着很多可以为植物直接吸收利用的营养物质，对于土壤肥力具有极重要的作用。
    土壤中液体的含量和成分不一。水分进入土壤，从土壤中浸出可溶性物质而转变为土壤溶液。土壤溶液有的呈酸性，有的呈碱性。土壤溶液中含有养分，可供作物生长的需要，但如盐分含量过多，也会影响作物的生长。
    土壤中气体含量多少，决定于土壤孔隙度和含水量多少。深耕可以促进作物根系的发育，就是由于深耕后，土壤疏松，空隙增多的缘故。一般水稻田由于土壤中水分多，空气就少；采用烤田的办法，可以增加土壤的空气。土壤中空气增加，氧化作用加强了，就能促进养分释放，供作物吸收。土壤经常泡水，不但空气减少，还会产生甲烷、硫化氢和氢等气体。这些气体积累过多，对作物生长不利，甚至发生毒害。
    在土壤中，无论是固体、液体和气体之间，有机物质和无机物质之间，有生命物质和无生命物质之间，都是互相联系、互相制约的，并且受着外界环境的影响。土壤的形成过程，就是土壤内部许多矛盾的统一过程。这些矛盾是：有机化合物的合成与分解，矿物质的合成与分解，有机无机复合体的合成与离散，水分和空气的获得与耗损，热能的吸收和消失等等。其中有机质的合成和分解，是土壤区别于风化壳的特点。这些矛盾是土壤运动发展的内因。由于土壤内部矛盾的多种多样，外界环境的错综复杂，因而形成的土壤也各种各样，它们的运动方向和速度也就各有不同。各种土壤也不是孤立存在的，而是彼此联系、互相影响的；它们的发生与运动也不是孤立进行的，而是由一种土壤过渡到另一种土壤的不可分割的锁链。人们如果认识土壤中的矛盾，了解土壤运动发展的规律，就可以把土壤运动引向有利于人的方向，即增加土壤肥力的方向发展。
    影响土壤运动发展的因素有自然条件和人类生产劳动两个方面。自然条件包括气候、生物、地形、母质和水文条件等等，它们综合地影响土壤的运动和发展，其中以生物作用为主。人类生产劳动对于土壤的影响和一般自然条件的影响有本质上的差异，引起土壤的变化也更大。人类生产劳动对于土壤的作用和一般生物活动不同，人类是有计划、有目的地利用和改良土壤。土壤经过人类耕垦，天然植物被农作物所代替，就会发生新的变化。人类劳动改造土壤的例证很多：荒地的垦殖，旱地的灌溉，平原的放淤，洼地及盐碱地的挖沟排水，梯田的修筑，水稻的种植，砂丘的固定和防护林带的营造等等都是。修筑梯田是具有我国特点的土壤改良法，不仅防止了水土流失，还把不能耕种的坡地改为良田，薄地变为厚土。又如深耕施肥和客土换土，也是我国固有的土壤改良法。粘土太粘掺点砂，砂土太散揉点泥，把部分或全部坏土换成好土，不仅改变土壤的组成，还可以改变土壤的性状，加速土壤熟化。河北省高阳县关镇公社用客土法把砂土换成黄沙土，小麦亩产由七十斤提高到二百七十斤；北京市密云下屯大队用垫圈客土把砂地改成两合土，小麦亩产由五十斤提高到三、四百斤，最高达七百斤。江苏苏州农民用有机肥料把白色土改造成灰色土，熟土层由三寸增加到八寸，使水稻亩产由二百斤增至七百斤。人的生产劳动大大改变了土壤的外界环境和土壤的运动进程，便使土壤向有利于人的方向发展。大跃进以来农业高产的事实已经向人们指出：在社会主义制度下，人类可以通过劳动高速度地改造土壤，不断提高土壤肥力。
    土壤肥力是各种土壤特性综合的表现。土壤不仅供给作物生长所需的水分、养分及其他生活条件，更重要的是能调节这些生活条件，满足作物在不同生长时期的不同需要，让作物“吃饱、喝足、住得舒服”。根据这个观点，肥沃土壤不仅是含有丰富的营养成分和水分，还具有调节植物生长所需的生活条件的能力。这些特性的产生，与土壤中有机物的合成和分解有密切的关系。这充分说明了有机物在土壤肥力中的重要意义。我国农民对此有深切体会，认为“土肥相融”是培育高度肥沃土壤的重要环节。根据我们的初步总结，土肥相融后，既蓄水保肥，又耐旱耐涝，有机质和氮素含量都增加，磷的固定降低，微生物活动旺盛，腐殖质的分子加大，功能团也增加。旱地中油土是最肥的土壤，其特性表现为“厚、柔、黑、油、抱”，即土层厚，土色发暗，看起来油亮，用手抓起来松软柔和，作物拔起土粒团聚根部不散。这就是旱地肥沃土壤的标志。系统地总结农民的经验，不仅将促进当前的农业生产，而且会使我国土壤科学得到一个革命性的发展。
    劳动定向改造土壤，就是充分发挥人的主观能动性，按人的需要来改造土壤。定向改造土壤不是盲目的行动，而是有目的有计划的工作。要定向改造土壤必须运用辩证唯物主义的观点，掌握土壤运动发展规律，具体分析土壤中的矛盾。忽视土壤矛盾的分析研究，就会犯主观主义的错误。
    改造土壤不是为改造而改造，而是为提高农业生产而改造。所以土壤改造的范围应该扩大。过去我们对于土壤改造的认识，范围很小，只限于有病的、不生产或生产力极低的土壤，如盐碱地、砂地、洼地和红壤等。这是不够的。我们不仅应该把有病的土壤治好，并使它提高肥力，把坏地改为良田，而且要把一般田改为丰产田，甚至于丰产田也要不断改良，使之丰产更丰产。土壤改造是无止境的，也没有固定的规格。土壤不断改造，农作物产量不断提高，这就是我们改造土壤的目标。当然，改造土壤要受到社会经济条件和科学技术水平等等的限制，在不同时间和空间条件下，土壤改造的要求也是有一定限度的。如果条件改变，要求提高，土壤的改造便又不断向前发展。
    我们要定向改造土壤，但并不是要把所有的土壤都用一种措施改成一模一样。各种土壤有不同的特性，各地区的自然条件也有差异，土壤发展的客观规律也不一致，要把不同的土壤改造成一种土壤，是很困难的，既不合理，更无必要。如果我们摸清天时地利，掌握作物生长习性，根据具体情况，控制肥水措施，不同土壤也可以同样获得高产。当然这样做，对农业耕作技术水平，要求较高，不是一般栽培条件所能办到的。要搞大面积丰产，要使农作物稳定丰收，最妥善的办法是培育肥沃的土壤。
    当前，在党的大办农业、大办粮食的号召下，农民群众大搞丰产方、园田化，改造土壤的热情很高，这些都是我们改造土壤、发展土壤科学的有利条件。我们深信，只要循着党的教导前进，我们一定可以不断取得新的更大的成就。
