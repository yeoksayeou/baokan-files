Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch: The most recent issue of the U.S. Department of Commerce's "Foreign Commerce Weekly" states that the U.S. government is encouraging further investment of U.S. private capital in India, and says "India is a market full of opportunities for enterprising American businessmen and investors."

The "Hindustan Standard" on the 18th, quoting a New Delhi 17th dispatch from the Near and Far East News Agency, explained that U.S. private capital is rapidly penetrating the Indian economy. The dispatch stated that recent estimates show that direct U.S. private investment in India is estimated at $165 million, of which approximately $15 million was invested at the end of 1959. The dispatch also said, "American companies may strive to operate here (in India), using India as a base for exporting products to West Asia and other markets." The dispatch further pointed out that the United States may encourage Japan and other subsidiaries to establish factories in India, thereby participating in more industrial activities in India.

The dispatch pointed out that the rapid penetration of U.S. capital into India is possible mainly for two reasons: first, under the Indo-U.S. agreement on avoidance of double taxation, U.S. investors can be tax-exempt for five years; second, the U.S.-India exchange guarantee agreement guarantees that U.S. investors can convert most of their profits earned in India into U.S. dollars and remit them back to the United States.

    美国资本迅速渗入印度
    美商务部刊物说印度是“充满着机会的市场”
    新华社23日讯　最近一期美国商务部“对外商务周刊”说，美国政府正在鼓励美国私人资本进一步在印度投资，并说“印度是有进取心的美国商人和投资者充满着机会的市场”。
    “印度斯坦旗报”18日引用近东远东通讯社新德里17日的消息说明，美国私人资本正在迅速地渗入印度经济。这则消息说，最近的估计表明，美国对印度的直接私人投资估计有一亿六千五百万美元，其中大约一千五百万美元是1959年年底的投资。这则消息还说，“美国公司可能竭力在这里（印度）进行活动，把印度作为向西亚和其他市场出口产品的基地。”消息还指出，美国可能鼓励日本和其他子公司在印度建立工厂，从而在印度参与更多的工业活动。　　消息指出，美国资本迅速渗入印度之所以可能，主要有两个原因：第一，根据印美避免双重征税协定，美国投资者可以免税五年；第二，美印兑换保证协定保证美国投资人可以把他们在印度获得的大部分利润兑换成美元汇回美国。
