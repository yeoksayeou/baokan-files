Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 11th. On the Tianjin steel front, in the unprecedented upsurge of the production increase and economy drive, political work reaches the furnaces, emulation is woven into a net, and the mass movement is magnificent, presenting an inspiring and excellent situation. The city's steel output in August increased by 18.3% compared to July, and September again set a record high for the city's steel output, rising in leaps and bounds every ten days, with a sharp increase of 28.68% compared to August. The acceptance rate of steel ingots increased from 94.55% in July to 98% in September. The consumption of pig iron per ton of steel in converters in September decreased by 14.78% compared to July, achieving an all-round leap forward of high output, high quality, and low consumption.

	Political work reaching the furnaces, continuously improving the ideological awareness of workers, and enabling everyone to be full of energy and work together to seize high output, is the first characteristic of the production increase and economy drive on the Tianjin steel front. As early as the end of July, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the Party's call to carry out the production increase and economy drive centered on grain and steel, launched publicity activities in all steel plants in the city, explaining the situation and assigning tasks to the broad masses of workers, and organizing discussions and debates to make the political and economic significance of completing this year's steelmaking tasks deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, further mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. In the process of organizing and leading the masses to realize the production increase and economy plans, various factories also listed good ideology and high style as competition conditions, as part of the evaluation. Many teams and groups combined production with "abstract" discussions in pre-shift, mid-shift, and post-shift meetings, commending advanced figures and spreading advanced ideas. Workers' ideology has been continuously improved, and their enthusiasm has become greater and greater. The ideas of striving for the first place and "taking steel as glory and the factory as home" have been further promoted, and the attendance rate of workers in various factories has generally increased.

	Inserting red flags everywhere, widely establishing pacesetters, and carrying out emulation drives are the second characteristic. Since August, the broad masses of workers on the steel front, according to the nature of production, have crossed workshops and factories to find opponents. Factories and factories, and workers of the same type, have signed various technical learning assistance contracts and learning-from-and-catching-up emulation contracts. Within the factories, learning-from-and-helping-each-other and collaboration emulation contracts have also been signed, and the following three forms of competition activities have been carried out relatively commonly: a one-dragon coordinated emulation drive centered on converters or open-hearth furnaces and focusing on pig iron melting furnaces; paired competitions and opponent competitions between groups and groups, furnaces and furnaces, and people and people; and key-problem solving performance competitions focusing on the key points of production in each period. Among them, the one-dragon coordinated competition is the main form. In the one-dragon coordinated competition, if there is a key problem in one place, the masses come together to tackle it. If one place has difficulties, warm hands are extended from all sides. Their common slogan is: "Hand over experience when handing over shifts, take over difficulties when taking over shifts." The Chen Ruiheng converter steelmaking group of the Third Steel Plant once had a low furnace life. The brother groups immediately sent their own top leaders to conduct "group medical consultations" through on-site operations, quickly found the problem, and broke through the production key. In the competition, heroic figures emerged in large numbers, and advanced deeds and advanced experiences emerged one after another. The Municipal Party Committee and various factories organized evaluations and established pacesetters in a timely manner, so that advanced experiences quickly blossomed and bore fruit. In the big evaluation in early September alone, various factories selected more than 480 advanced workshops, red flag groups, advanced groups, and advanced individuals.

	Organizing assault battles in an organized and prepared manner, high output - consolidation - and then high output, promoting the continuous leap forward of production, is the third characteristic. Under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Party committees of various factories adopted the method of launching high-yield ten-day periods. During a ten-day period, they generally spent three days preparing for the transfer of raw materials, equipment maintenance, and mobilizing the masses to set targets and measures. They spent seven days launching a high-yield assault week. During the high-yield week, all factories assigned tasks directly to the furnace platform, groups, and individuals, and widely organized technical performance competitions, key-problem solving competitions, and other activities around the key points of production. Leading cadres directed in shifts, grasping preparation before the shift, grasping inspection during the shift, and grasping summary after the shift. After the high-yield week, they immediately seized the time to mobilize the masses to summarize experience and formulate new measures to create conditions for the next high-yield week. This method of vigorously carrying out mass movements with assaults and rests can give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses, quickly overcome the weak links in production, and seize as much production results as possible without missing the opportunity. Since launching the high-yield week in September, all four steel plants in the city have broken through the highest daily output level since the establishment of the factories.

	Continuously improving the style of leadership and continuously improving the level of management, so that the vigorous and solid are combined, is the fourth characteristic. Since the production increase and economy drive entered a new upsurge, leading cadres of various factories have generally gone deep into the front line to discuss high output with the masses. Among the cadres, the working method of "grasping both hands" was also conscientiously implemented. That is: they can not only go deep down, but also sit down and study problems; they not only grasp the present, but also grasp the next step; they not only grasp the key points, but also take care of the overall situation; they not only grasp big problems, but also grasp small problems; they not only grasp production, but also grasp life; they not only have unified leadership, but also have division of labor and responsibility. Therefore, the initiative and foresight of the work have been greatly strengthened. In the movement, various factories generally adopted the method of arranging production plans on a daily, shift, and furnace basis, so that the daily plans can be implemented to the team, group, and individual. In arranging production, all factories, in the spirit of "taking three steps while taking one step," arranged the production tasks for the second day and the preparation work for the third day while grasping the production of the day, striving for the initiative in production.

	The raging tide of competition and the torrent of the city's people working together to support steelmaking merged together, and the "front" and "rear" echoed each other, which is the fifth characteristic. Since August, a collaboration network to support steel production has been formed in all walks of life in the city. More than 50 factories in the city's machinery, electrical machinery, and other seven industrial systems have taken the initiative to undertake the task of rushing to manufacture smelting equipment and various spare parts. The transportation department has set up on-site command posts in various steel plants to transport smelting materials at any time. The commercial departments have also sent leading cadres to lead workers to work in steel plants, taking the initiative to understand needs, deliver goods to the door, and provide services to the door. Medical personnel went deep into the furnaces to ensure the health of steelworkers. Theater actors took the initiative to organize consolation performances for steelworkers. Teachers and students of schools and residents of streets and neighborhoods also organized to go to steel plants to clean up, wash clothes for workers. This full-hearted support of the people of the city not only quickly and effectively helped various steel plants solve many practical problems, but also gave steelworkers great encouragement in spirit.

    政治工作到炉前人人干劲十足　劳动竞赛织成网英雄人物辈出
    天津钢铁战士同心协力夺高产
    九月份钢产量创最高纪录，钢锭合格率上升，铁耗降低
    新华社天津11日电　天津市钢铁战线在规模空前的增产节约运动中，政治工作到炉前，竞赛交织成网，群众运动波澜壮阔，出现一派振奋人心的大好形势。全市8月份钢产量比7月份增长18.3％，9月份又连创全市钢产量的历史最高纪录，逐旬跳跃式上升，比8月份再猛增28.68％；钢锭合格率由7月份的94.55％提高到9月份的98％；转炉每吨钢的生铁消耗9月份比7月份降低14.78％，实现了高产、优质、低耗全面跃进。
    政治工作到炉前，不断提高职工的思想觉悟，使人人鼓足干劲，同心协力夺高产，是天津市钢铁战线增产节约运动中的第一个特点。早在7月底，中共天津市委就根据党的开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的号召，发动全市各钢厂展开宣传活动，向广大职工讲形势、交任务，组织鸣放辩论，使完成今年炼钢任务的政治意义和经济意义深入人心，进一步调动起广大职工的生产积极性。各厂在组织领导群众实现增产节约计划的过程中，还把思想好、风格高列为竞赛条件，作为评比的一项内容。许多班组在班前、班中、班后会上都结合生产进行“务虚”，表扬先进人物，传播先进思想。职工们思想不断提高，干劲越来越大，争第一和“以钢为荣、以厂为家”的思想进一步发扬，各厂职工出勤率普遍提高。
    大插红旗，广树标兵，开展竞赛，是第二个特点。从8月份以来，钢铁战线广大职工，根据生产性质，跨车间，越工厂，寻找对手，厂与厂，同工种与同工种之间纷纷签订各种技术学帮合同和学赶超竞赛合同。在各厂内部，也都签订了学赶帮和协作竞赛合同，并且比较普遍开展了以下三种形式的竞赛活动：以转炉或平炉为中心，以化铁炉为重点的一条龙协作竞赛；组与组、炉与炉、人与人的对口赛、对手赛；围绕每个时期生产关键的攻关表演赛。其中尤以一条龙协作赛为主要形式。在一条龙协作赛中，一处有关键，群起来围攻；一处有困难，四面八方伸出热情之手。他们的共同口号是：“交班交经验，接班接困难”。第三钢厂陈瑞衡转炉炼钢小组一度炉龄不高，各兄弟小组马上派来了自己的第一把手，通过实地操作“群医会诊”，很快地找到了毛病，突破了生产关键。在竞赛中，英雄人物辈出，先进事迹和先进经验层出不穷。市委和各厂及时组织评比，树立标兵，使先进经验很快开花结果。单是9月初的大评比，各厂就选出了四百八十多个先进车间、红旗小组、先进小组和先进个人。
    有组织有准备地大搞突击战役，高产——巩固——再高产，推动生产不断跃进，是第三个特点。各厂党委在中共天津市委领导下，采取了大搞高产旬的办法，一旬当中，一般用三天的时间进行调运原料材料，维修设备，发动群众订指标和措施等准备工作，用七天的时间，大搞高产突击周。在高产周里，各厂都把任务一直下达到炉台、小组和个人，围绕生产关键，广泛组织技术表演赛、攻关赛等活动。领导干部分班指挥，班前抓准备、班中抓检查、班后抓总结。高产周过后，立即抓紧时间，发动群众总结经验，制订新的措施，为下一个高产周创造条件。这种有突击有休整的大搞群众运动的办法，能够充分发挥群众的积极性，迅速克服生产中的薄弱环节，不失时机地取得尽可能多的生产成果。从9月份大搞高产周以来，全市四个钢厂全部突破了建厂以来的最高日产水平。
    不断改进领导作风，不断提高管理水平，使轰轰烈烈与扎扎实实相结合，是第四个特点。增产节约运动进入新的高潮以来，各厂领导干部普遍深入第一线，与群众一起共谋高产。在干部当中，还认真地贯彻执行了“两手抓”的工作方法。就是：既能深入下去，又能坐下来研究问题；既抓当前，又抓下一步，既抓重点，又照顾全面；既抓大问题又抓小问题；既抓生产，又抓生活；既有统一领导，又有分工负责。因此，大大加强了工作的主动性和预见性。在运动中，各厂普遍采取了按日、按班、按炉台安排生产计划的办法，使每天的计划都能落实到班、组和个人。在安排生产当中，各厂都本着“走一步看三步”的精神，在抓当天生产的同时，布置第二天的生产任务和第三天的生产准备工作，争得了生产的主动。
    如火如荼的竞赛浪潮与全市人民同心协力支援炼钢的洪流汇合在一起，“前方”“后方”互相呼应，是第五个特点。从8月份起，全市各行各业就形成了一个支援钢铁生产的协作网。全市机械、电机等七个工业系统的五十多个工厂，主动承担了赶制冶炼设备及各种备件的任务。交通运输部门在各钢厂设立了现场指挥部，随时运输冶炼物资。商业部门也纷纷由领导干部率领职工驻钢厂办公，主动了解需要，送货上门，服务上门。医务人员深入炉前，保证炼钢工人们的身体健康；剧团演员主动为钢铁工人组织慰问演出；学校师生、街道居民，也纷纷组织起来，到钢厂为职工打扫卫生，拆洗衣服。全市人民这种满腔热情的支援，不仅迅速有效地帮助各钢厂解决了许多实际问题，而且从精神上给了钢铁工人以极大的鼓舞。
