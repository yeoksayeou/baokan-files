Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 12th: The entire staff of the Changshou County Committee of the Communist Party of China in the suburbs of Chongqing are cultivating organ experimental fields on a large scale, promoting a mass movement of cadres and masses throughout the county to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, and further improve leadership methods and styles.

The Changshou County Committee has a total of 118 staff members, and more than 70 cadres regularly take turns going to the countryside to lead agricultural production. In 1958, the County Committee began planting experimental fields. This year, the County Committee carefully summarized and studied the experiences and achievements of planting experimental fields over the years, and believed that this was the best method for guiding agricultural production. It was decided to greatly improve the leadership method of planting experimental fields, from a few leading cadres and resident commune cadres jointly planting with farmers, to all organ staff participating in planting experimental fields. Last year, the County Committee reclaimed 60 mu of organ experimental fields, which was expanded to 120 mu this year, with an average of more than one mu per person, and the experimental crops were also greatly increased. In order to comprehensively understand the growth patterns of major crops, especially grain crops, they adopted various improved varieties and tested various cultivation techniques. From the First Secretary of the County Committee to the general staff, everyone contributed ideas and thought of ways to work in the fields barefoot, participating in planting experimental fields, while insisting on completing daily work of the organs. When encountering difficulties in cultivation techniques, they sent people to the communes to "study" and learn from experienced farmers. In order not to increase additional expenses for the organs, in addition to the organs purchasing a small number of manure buckets and baskets, each staff member prepared their own hoes, sickles, raincoats, bamboo hats and other necessary production tools. The hard-working and simple style of all the cadres greatly encouraged the masses.

After the leading cadres of the County Committee participated in the planting of organ experimental fields, they had a point of reliance, and were able to systematically and comprehensively grasp the production laws of crops from planting to harvesting and storage, so that they could lead overall production more correctly and more timely. For example, this year, after they first discovered rice stem borers in their experimental fields, they immediately sent cadres to investigate the rice fields in the communes, and found that the rice had indeed begun to be infested with borers. The County Committee promptly launched a massive mass movement to eliminate borers throughout the county, and eliminated the borers within a few days. Sweet potatoes are the county's main grain and feed crop, but in the past, the cultivation was crude, the yield was not high, and problems such as poor storage and large losses had not been solved for a long time. In order to comprehensively grasp the whole set of experience in sweet potato cultivation, management, seed retention, and storage, the County Committee focused on sweet potato production as a key experimental project. Ji Junyi, the First Secretary of the County Committee, personally led the planting of sweet potato experimental fields, boldly innovated several cultivation techniques and preservation techniques, and immediately held on-site meetings to promote them throughout the county after gaining experience, which promoted the overall improvement of sweet potato production in the county.

The large-scale planting of experimental fields by the County Committee has given a new look to the entire organ and the mental outlook of the cadres. The hard-working and frugal style of all the staff has transformed the County Committee into both a grassroots production unit and a Party leadership organ. All the staff of the organ have taken a big step forward on the road of being both red and expert. The vast majority of people have learned two sets of skills, both knowing how to work and how to produce. Most of the seventeen members of the Communist Youth League working in the organs originally lacked knowledge of agricultural production; after labor training, they have now all learned the cultivation techniques of planting rice, vegetables, oil crops, and planting sweet potatoes. Because of frequent contact with production practice, all the staff are becoming more and more interested in rural work and agricultural production, and many people are vying to go to the countryside to settle down and build new rural areas. Of the 118 staff members in the entire organ, more than 70 are regularly stationed in the communes to lead production, and they have contracted more than 70 poor and backward teams. In the severe droughts of the past two years, the resident commune cadres have shared the same breath and destiny with the commune members and jointly overcome the drought. Now half of the poor and backward teams have changed their appearance.

The large-scale planting of experimental fields by the County Committee has set an example for the vast number of cadres and masses in the county, greatly promoting and promoting the movement of the people throughout the county to further develop agriculture and grain production. "Learn from the County Committee and be the same as the County Committee" has become the slogan of cadres and masses in organs, schools, factories, mines, and urban and rural people's communes throughout the county. This year alone, the organs at the county and commune levels have planted more than 2,300 mu of experimental fields for various crops. Each county-level organ, led by leading cadres, has organized more than 600 cadres to go to production teams to settle down. In addition, the cadres of all twelve people's communes and 127 management districts in the county have also established a system of participating in agricultural production and large-scale planting of high-yield command fields. The secretaries of the commune party committees have adhered to working four hours a day, and many have done so, holding meetings and working where they are working.

A great situation has emerged on the agricultural production front of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production throughout the county. This year, although Changshou County has suffered its second consecutive year of drought, grain production has still increased. The commune members are even more enthusiastic, and the autumn plowing and sowing season has been advanced compared with previous years. As of the end of September, the county has plowed more than 310,000 mu of land, completing the first stage of deep plowing ahead of schedule, and the quality also meets the standards.

The experimental fields planted by the County Committee have harvested more than 87,000 jin of vegetables, more than 5,000 jin of grain, and raised 114 pigs during this period. Now the organs have achieved a surplus of vegetables and meat, and will be able to achieve basic or mostly self-sufficiency in grain and office expenses within the year. In this way, it not only improves the lives of cadres, but also increases social wealth and reduces the burden on the state.

In leading the planting of experimental fields by the County Committee organs, the Changshou County Committee paid attention to carrying out meticulous ideological education and organizational work. In order to overcome the contradiction between work, labor, and study, the entire organ uniformly established a production committee to comprehensively and reasonably arrange labor time, and formed production groups with units with the same and similar business nature to contract a part of production. Various departments with similar business nature also organized joint offices to cooperate with each other to complete the daily work of the organs. Everyone took time to participate in planting experimental fields. The cadres stationed in the communes also participated in a part of the labor when they returned to the organs for meetings. Recently, in order to rush production, the 30 or so staff members left in the organs, in addition to leaving a few people to guard the organs, all packed their luggage and brought office supplies to stay near the experimental fields, producing and working at the same time.

### 既是基层生产单位　又是党的领导机关  长寿县大种机关试验田推动全县生产

    既是基层生产单位　又是党的领导机关
    长寿县大种机关试验田推动全县生产
    新华社重庆12日电　中共重庆市郊长寿县委机关全体工作人员，大种机关试验田，推动了全县干部和群众掀起大办农业，大办粮食的群众运动，并且进一步改进了领导方法和领导作风。
    中共长寿县委机关共有一百一十八名工作人员，有七十多名干部经常轮流下乡领导农业生产，1958年县委机关就开始了种试验田。今年县委认真总结和研究了历年种试验田的经验和成绩，认为这是指导农业生产的一项最好的方法，决定把种试验田的领导方法大大提高一步，由少数领导干部和驻社干部与农民合种，发展到机关工作人员人人都参加种试验田。去年，这个县委开荒种了六十亩机关试验田，今年扩大到一百二十亩，平均每人种一亩多地，试验的作物也大大增多。为了全面摸清主要农作物，特别是粮食作物的生长规律，他们采用了各种优良品种，试验了各种耕作技术。从县委第一书记到一般工作人员，人人出主意想办法，大家边脱鞋下田，参加种试验田，边坚持完成机关日常工作。在遇到耕作技术上的困难时，就派人到公社“留学”，向老农求教。为了不增加机关额外开支，除机关购置少数粪桶、箩筐外，每个工作人员都自备了锄头、镰刀、蓑衣、斗笠等必需的生产用具。全体干部这种艰苦朴素的作风，使群众受到了很大的鼓舞。
    县委领导干部参加机关种试验田后，有了点的依托，从种到收、到藏，能够较系统、较全面地掌握农作物的生产规律，这样就能更正确、更及时地领导全面生产。例如今年他们在自己的试验田里首先发现螟虫害后，立即派干部到公社的稻田调查，果然发现水稻开始有了螟害。县委及时在全县开展了一个声势浩大的灭螟群众运动，在几天内就消灭了螟害。红薯是全县主要粮食和饲料作物，但过去耕作粗放，产量不高，收藏不好损耗大等问题长期没有解决。县委为了全面掌握红薯的栽培、管理、留种、收藏等一整套经验，便把红薯生产作为重点试验项目。县委第一书记纪俊仪亲自领导了种红薯试验田，大胆革新了几项栽培技术和保藏技术，取得经验后立即召开现场会在全县推广，促进了全县红薯生产水平普遍提高。
    县委机关大种试验田，使整个机关面貌和干部精神面貌为之一新。全体工作人员克勤克俭，埋头苦干的作风把县委机关变成了既是一个基层生产单位，又是一个党的领导机关。全机关工作人员在又红又专的道路上迈进了一大步，绝大多数人已经学会了两套本领，既会工作，又会生产。在机关工作的十七名共青团员，原来多数人缺乏农业生产知识；经过劳动锻炼后，现在全部学会种植水稻、蔬菜、油料作物和栽插红薯等耕作技术。由于经常接触生产实际，全体工作人员越来越对农村工作和农业生产发生了浓厚的兴趣，许多人争着要下乡下社安家落户，建设新农村。全机关一百一十八名工作人员中经常有七十多名驻社领导生产，他们包干了七十多个穷队和落后队。在去年和今年连续两年大旱中，驻社干部与社员群众同呼吸，共命运，一道战胜了旱情。现在已有半数穷队和落后队改变了面貌。
    县委机关大种试验田，在全县广大干部和群众中作出了榜样，大大促进和推动了全县人民进一步开展大办农业，大办粮食的运动。“向县委看齐，和县委一个样”，成了全县各级机关、学校、厂矿、城乡人民公社的干部和群众的口号。今年仅县和公社两级的机关就种了各种作物的试验田二千三百多亩，各个县级机关由领导干部带队，组织了六百多名干部下生产队安家落户。另外，全县十二个人民公社和一百二十七个管理区的干部也都建立了参加农业生产和大种高产指挥田的制度。各个公社党委书记坚持了每天劳动四小时，许多人都做到在那里劳动，就在那里开会办公。
    大办农业，大办粮食，在全县农业生产战线上出现了一派大好形势。今年长寿县虽然又遭受到第二个旱年，但粮食仍然增产。广大社员干劲更足，秋耕秋种季节比往年提前了。截至9月下旬为止，全县已翻耕土地三十一万多亩，提前完成了第一阶段的深翻任务，质量也合乎规格。
    县委机关种的试验田，在这段时期内共收获蔬菜八万七千多斤、粮食五千多斤，养猪一百一十四头。现在机关已经做到蔬菜、肉食品自给有余，年内还能做到粮食和办公费用基本自给或大部分自给。这样，既改善了干部生活，又增加了社会财富，减轻了国家负担。
    中共长寿县委在领导县委机关种试验田中，注意进行细致的思想教育工作和组织工作。为了克服工作、劳动、学习的矛盾，全机关统一成立了生产委员会，全面地、合理地安排劳动时间，以业务性质相同和相近的单位组成生产小组，划片包干一部分生产，各个业务性质相近的部门还组织联合办公，相互协作完成机关日常工作，人人抽出时间参加种试验田，下乡驻社干部也在回机关开会时参加一部分劳动。最近为了突击生产，留机关的三十多名工作人员除留下少数人看守机关外，都背起行李、带上办公用具驻在试验田附近，一面生产，一面办公。
