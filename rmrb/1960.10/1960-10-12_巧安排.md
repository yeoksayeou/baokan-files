Clever Arrangements

Agricultural production has a strong seasonality, and agricultural activities have strict time requirements, which forms the characteristic of uneven busyness and leisure throughout the year.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the speed of agricultural production development has increased, the required standards have also increased, and the contradiction between tasks and labor has become increasingly obvious. How to use troops cleverly and arrange them cleverly to maximize the potential of labor has become a major issue in continuously improving agricultural production. The example of Duanliu Management Area of ​​Chengguan Rocket Commune in Qin County, Shanxi Province, reforming the farming system and adjusting the busy and slack seasons of agriculture provides us with a very good experience in solving the shortage of labor.

The comrades in this management area are good at conducting specific analysis of specific problems. Based on the agricultural production's "three tenses," "three relaxations," and "one idle" busy and slack agricultural seasons formed by local history, combined with local climatic conditions and crop adaptability, they start with the word "early" to disperse agricultural work during the busy farming season. By exploring the rules, investigating the reasons, summarizing experience, and combining experiments, the crops that can be sown early are sown early, and the crops that can be sown in batches are sown in batches. Batch planting also brings batch management and phased harvesting. This naturally regulates the early and late stages of agricultural work and the busy and slack seasons, and overcomes the phenomenon of labor shortage caused by excessive concentration of labor during the busy farming season.

Doing as much of the work during the busy farming season as possible during the slack season is another important measure they take to solve the shortage of labor during the busy farming season. In the past, the custom here was to start delivering fertilizer and preparing land after the beginning of spring, but now it is completed in winter. In this way, the slack season does the work of the busy season, and the "three relaxations" share the "three tenses" tasks. Labor arrangements are strengthened with planning and gain the initiative.

According to the laws of natural disasters that have occurred in the past, changing the sowing period and changing to planting crops with strong disaster resistance not only resisted disasters and ensured increased production, but also greatly avoided the labor tension caused by disaster-destroyed planting and replanting delays, maximizing the savings of living labor. These practices are undoubtedly very realistic.

The production arrangement and management system of the People's Commune is a scientific and meticulous organizational work. How to continuously understand and grasp various new situations and various laws in production and management, and master the initiative in the use of labor is certainly not an easy task. However, the facts of the Duanliu Management Area show us that as long as we carefully summarize experience, specifically analyze specific problems, and go deep into the masses to jointly study and work hard with veteran farmers, technicians, and scientific research departments, we can completely find a way to move forward rapidly.

    巧安排
    农业生产有强烈的季节性，农事活动有严格的时间要求，这就形成了一年四季忙闲不匀的特点。
    大跃进以来，农业生产发展的速度高了，要求的标准也高了，任务和劳力的矛盾越来越明显起来。如何巧用兵、巧安排，最大限度地发掘劳动潜力，就成了不断提高农业生产的大事。山西省沁县城关火箭公社段柳管理区改革耕作制度，调节农忙农闲的事例，给我们提供了一条解决劳力不足的很好的经验。
    这个管理区的同志们善于对具体问题进行具体分析，他们根据本地历史形成的农业生产上的“三紧”、“三松”、“一闲”的农忙农闲情况，结合当地气候条件和作物适应能力，从“早”字做起，来疏散农忙季节的农活。通过摸规律，查原因，总结经验，结合试验，把能够提前播种的作物提前播种，把可以分期分批播种的作物分期分批下种。分批种，也带来了分批管、分期收，这就很自然地调节了农活的迟早和忙闲，克服了农忙时劳力使用过于集中而造成的劳力不足的现象。
    尽可能把农忙时的活，提早在农闲季节去做，是他们解决农忙时劳力不足的又一个重要措施。历年来，这里的习惯是一开春才开始送肥、整地等备耕工作，现在提前到冬季完成，这样就农闲干了农忙活，“三松”分担了“三紧”事，劳力安排上加强了计划性，争得了主动权。
    根据历年来自然灾害发生的规律，改变播种期，改种抗灾力强的作物等措施，不仅抵御了灾害，保证了增产，也大大地避免了因灾毁种、补种误工而带来的劳动力紧张，最大限度地节省了活劳动。这些做法，无疑都是非常有现实意义的。
    人民公社的生产安排和经营管理制度，是一项科学的细致的组织工作，如何在不断地认识和掌握生产上、经营管理上的各种新的情况和各种规律，掌握好劳动力使用上的主动权，当然不是容易的事情。但是，段柳管理区的事实向我们表明，只要认真地总结经验，具体地分析具体问题，并深入群众，与老农、技术员和科学研究部门共同研究、共同努力，完全能够找到迅速前进的途径。
