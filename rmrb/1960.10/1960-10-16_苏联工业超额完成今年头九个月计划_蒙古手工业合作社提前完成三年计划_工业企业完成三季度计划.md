    所有加盟共和国都完成和超额完成了九个月的总产值计划和大多数重要工业品的产值计划。
    在今年头九个月中，苏联生铁产量为三千四百七十万吨，比去年同期增加二百九十万吨；钢——四千八百四十万吨（约增加四百万吨）；钢材——三千七百七十万吨（增加三百万吨）；煤——三亿八千七百万吨（增加六百七十万吨）；石油——一亿零九百万吨（增加一千三百万吨）；瓦斯——三百三十五亿立方米（增加七十三亿立方米）；电力——一千八百七十亿度（增加一百七十亿度）。

    公报指出，虽然大多数工业部门的工作日缩短了，但是，在这个时期内工业中的劳动生产率比去年同期仍然增加了6％。到今年10月1日为止，有四千多万职工按缩短了的工作日工作。
