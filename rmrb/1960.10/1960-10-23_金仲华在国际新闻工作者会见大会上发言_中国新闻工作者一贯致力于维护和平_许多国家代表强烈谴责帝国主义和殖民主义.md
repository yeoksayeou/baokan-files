Xinhua News Agency report: The Second International Meeting of Journalists continued its general debate.

Jin Zhonghua, head of the Chinese delegation, spoke at the meeting on the 20th. He pointed out that the scenes reflected in the speeches at the meeting, of journalists opposing imperialism and colonialism, striving for peace, and fighting for national independence, democratic freedom, and social progress, vividly reflect the unprecedented upsurge of the power of the people of the world and the vigorous development of the world's progressive journalism. He said that public opinion now outweighs the clamor of the imperialist propaganda machine.

Jin Zhonghua expressed his support for the representatives of many countries who denounced the reactionary forces' attacks on the people's journalism. He said that Chinese journalists have always been committed to maintaining peace, faithfully publicizing the Chinese government's consistent policy of peaceful coexistence with countries with different social systems, actively supporting universal disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and the easing of international tensions, exposing U.S. imperialism's arms expansion and war preparations, calling on the people to oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression and war schemes, and vigorously reporting on the struggles of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries.

Jin Zhonghua stated that Chinese journalists are willing to help the progressive journalism of newly independent and aspiring countries to break the shackles of imperialist news monopolies.

Finally, Jin Zhonghua talked about the development of China's journalism and the efforts of Chinese journalists to strengthen exchanges and cooperation among journalists from various countries, and hoped that this meeting would become a new milestone on the road of solidarity and progress for journalists around the world.

Jin Zhonghua's speech received warm applause from the representatives for a long time.

Mexican representative Renato Leduc spoke at the meeting, saying that the United States is conducting anti-communist propaganda in Latin America and attacking the Latin American News Agency because it fears that the people of other countries will follow the Cuban revolution.

Algerian representative Malik condemned the French colonialists for imprisoning and massacring patriotic journalists who fought for the liberation of their motherland. He suggested that the participants of the meeting observe a moment of silence for the colleagues in Africa, Asia, and Latin America who sacrificed themselves in the anti-colonialist battle. Then, the whole venue stood in silence for one minute.

French representative Estier spoke about how French democratic newspapers were suppressed and persecuted by the government for supporting the struggle of the Algerian people.

Czechoslovakian Vojtěch Dolejší pointed out in his speech at the meeting that journalists must fight against imperialism and colonialism, and journalists can only cooperate on the basis of such common principles.

Guinean representative Jean Diene emphasized in his speech that cooperation should be carried out with all those who oppose imperialism.

Bulgarian representative Lyuben Velev expressed opposition to Cold War propaganda, opposition to the publication of untrue news, and support for the adoption of a resolution against colonialism at the meeting.

Doudou Guèye, representative of the Republic of Mali, once again took the stage at the meeting on the 19th to condemn the exploitation and oppression of imperialism that has caused poverty and backwardness among the people of the colonies. He said that, therefore, the colonial people must first drive away the colonialists. And after the people have gained independence, they must also eliminate the remnants of colonialism in order to develop their own culture.

Sri Lanka's Kariyakaranawa advocated taking action to unite news organizations, and he also advocated the recent "Bandung Conference" of the Asian-African press.

Soviet representative Khalaminov pointed out in his speech at the meeting that seeking the liberation of the people of countries that are not yet independent, eliminating racial discrimination and oppression, and striving for a better future are the common goals of journalists from Asian, African, and Latin American countries and socialist countries. He said that for a better life, we must defend peace; without peace, there is no social creation, no progress. He condemned some Western newspapers controlled by monopoly groups for taking a negative attitude on the three important issues of peace, opposition to colonialism, and the realization of peaceful coexistence.

Khalaminov said that journalists should mobilize readers to fight for peace and complete and thorough disarmament, and should help underdeveloped countries develop their own news industries.

South Africa's Ainslie exposed that the reactionary newspapers controlled by white racists in South Africa are doing their best to slander the national independence movements of the masses and to block the actual situation of racial persecution in South Africa.

Korean representative Hyun Joon-geuk called on the representatives attending the meeting to support the just demand of the Korean people for the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea.

Cuban representative, the head of the Latin American News Agency, Masetti, fiercely criticized U.S. imperialism for attacking and suppressing the Latin American News Agency through the newspapers it controls and its tools in various Latin American countries, which report the true situation of the Cuban revolution and the struggles of the Latin American people.

Vietnamese representative Nguyen Thanh Le exposed the barbaric suppression of the people and journalists of South Vietnam by U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique; and used the experience of North Vietnam to illustrate that after the people of colonies and dependencies have gained independence, they must actively eliminate the remnants of colonialism.

Representatives from Venezuela, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Indonesia, Finland, Ecuador, Poland, Hungary, Romania, the German Democratic Republic, Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Dahomey, Greece, and Yugoslavia also spoke at the two-day meeting.

As of the 20th, a total of 270 journalists from 61 countries had arrived in Baden to participate in the Second Meeting.
