This newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on the 29th: The Fengtaiping Management District of the Dayou People's Commune in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, has consistently implemented the labor quota and work evaluation point system for six years, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses and promoting the development of production. During this year's autumn harvest production, due to reasonable quotas for various agricultural tasks and the conscientious adherence to the work evaluation point system, the autumn crops in the entire management district, originally planned to be harvested in seven days, were completed in just five days.

The Fengtaiping Management District has accumulated rich experience in adhering to the labor quota and work evaluation point system for six years. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has instructed all communes in the province to learn from them. Their main experiences are as follows:

    Establish Good Quota Standards

How to formulate labor quota standards? The method of this management district is: First, arrange all agricultural tasks in the order of the agricultural season, and then, item by item, based on the quantity and quality standards that a medium-strength laborer can achieve in one day of hard work, determine the labor quota standards for each agricultural task. The method for formulating remuneration standards is: based on factors such as the amount of effort and technical skill required for various agricultural tasks, rank them into ten levels: technically demanding heavy work, technically average heavy work, general work, general light work, and light work. Both the labor quota standards and the remuneration standards have been discussed and revised item by item by the commune members' congress. The commune members unanimously believe that they are fair and reasonable, and they are motivated to work.

Subsequently, methods for revising labor quotas were also stipulated. For example, whenever new labor quotas need to be established or revised due to tool reforms, technological improvements, etc., the commune (management district) is responsible; whenever local adjustments are needed due to different crop growth, weed size, soil hardness, and other conditions, making it difficult or easy to complete the quota, the production team is responsible for making adjustments within the scope of the team's total quota of work points.

    Improve Work Evaluation and Point Recording Methods

The main issue after formulating labor quotas and remuneration standards is how to conscientiously carry out work evaluation and point recording. At the beginning of work evaluation and point recording, there was either no sound or endless arguments. Some always recorded ten work points, while others recorded work points based on the basic labor force score; some evaluated work and recorded points on the same day, while others recorded work points once every three or four days. At this time, some commune members said: "Work evaluation and point recording is not fair, it's the same as having no quotas."

The Party branch believed that doing a good job in work evaluation and point recording was a key step in conscientiously implementing quota management, so it launched a discussion among the broad masses of commune members. Relying on everyone's discussion, a variety of work evaluation and point recording methods were developed: (1) On-site scoring. For agricultural tasks that are collectively operated in the field, check on the spot at the end of work, score on the spot, record points on the spot, and settle accounts periodically. (2) Small contracts. For tasks that can be collectively operated, contract them to work groups according to the quota, complete them on schedule, inspect the work and record points. (3) Directly record points according to the quota. For tasks that can be fixed to be operated by dedicated personnel, such as carrying manure, driving carts, cutting grass, etc., directly record the number of work points completed. (4) Record points by time. For example, watching the fields and watching sheep lying down are all recorded by time. At the same time, the Party branch further strengthened political and ideological work among commune members, and the commune members' labor consciousness was greatly improved. Because the broad masses of commune members have this kind of consciousness, each work evaluation and point recording only takes one or two minutes, and the work points are evaluated fairly and reasonably.

    Strict Acceptance System

In the process of implementing the work evaluation point system, there was a period when the work evaluation point recording work was not combined with the acceptance system, so some commune members only cared about speed and not quality when doing work. In response to these situations, the Party branch educated the masses with concrete facts and launched a mass movement to improve the quality of agricultural work. Over the past few years, the fundamental and effective way to improve the quality of agricultural work has been: on the basis of strengthening political and ideological work, strengthen the acceptance system. For example, the work group that does the next process checks the quality of the previous process; the production team accepts the work of the work group according to the contracted section; and regularly organizes competitions between commune members and commune members, work groups and work groups, and production teams and production teams.

    Oppose Waste of Labor

The work day is the basis for implementing distribution according to work. Opposing the waste of labor and reasonably sorting out the work days participating in the distribution is another important aspect of promoting commune members' concern for production and concern for work days. In the Fengtaiping Management District, for six years, the dividend per labor day has increased from two jiao to more than seven jiao per labor day, in addition to the part that is supplied. There is an extremely important experience here, which is to strictly control non-productive labor and reasonably sort out labor days. There was a period in this management district when the use of labor days was relatively chaotic. At that time, some commune members thought, "Labor days are worthless," and "It's useless to do more labor days." After the Party branch discovered this problem, it promptly conducted research and took emergency measures:

(1) Cadres actively participate in labor and lead production with production. In less than ten months this year, each person averaged more than two hundred labor days. Cadres who are delayed from work due to official duties implement a quota to subsidize labor days. The subsidy work points for the main cadres of the management district do not exceed one-fifth of the total labor days done by the same labor force throughout the year, and the cadre subsidies plus management fees do not exceed 2% of the total income. (2) The use of labor in basic construction should not be too much, and should generally be controlled to 5% to 10% of the total number of labor days throughout the year, and should mainly be applied to basic construction that benefits in the current year. (3) Temporary labor called upon by the county and commune should be paid to the management district according to the wages of urban odd jobs, and the cooperative work between management districts and management districts, production teams and production teams should be settled clearly according to the principle of equal value exchange. (4) National compulsory labor is apportioned according to the labor force. (5) Labor for entertainment, sanitation, etc., is all used during rest time and is not recorded as labor days. (6) The subsidy work for volunteer teachers is apportioned by the students; the labor for service personnel in collective welfare undertakings is subsidized by the public welfare fund, self-sufficient in part by their own production, and apportioned by the relevant personnel in part. After the implementation of these measures, it was supported by the broad masses of commune members.

    Guarantee Distribution Fulfillment

On the one hand, reasonably sort out labor days, and on the other hand, guarantee distribution fulfillment. This is the main guarantee for adhering to the labor quota work evaluation point system; at the same time, it is also a good result of implementing the labor quota work evaluation point system. Not only has the value of labor days in the Fengtaiping Management District increased year by year, but commune members have also received cash in a timely manner after the distribution. After doing this, the cadres are often relaxed and happy, production is well-organized every year, and the work is often proactive; at the same time, the commune members receive cash, their morale is high, and they are more motivated to work.

The main experience of this management district in being able to fulfill distribution every year is: (1) Cadres do not borrow money. Under their influence, commune members also rarely borrow money; (2) Save expenses and use special funds for special purposes. After the public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, management fee, production fee, etc., have formulated an expenditure plan, they are managed by a dedicated person and used under a contracted responsibility system. At the same time, they also pay attention to arranging the income of households with difficulties.

    凤台坪管理区六年坚持评工记分
    山西省委指示各公社学习他们的经验
    本报太原29日电　山西省武乡县大有人民公社凤台坪管理区六年来一贯坚持执行了劳动定额、评工记分制度，调动了群众积极性，促进了生产的发展。今年三秋生产中，由于各种农活都有合理的定额，认真坚持评工记分制度，全管理区的秋作物，原计划七天收完，结果只用了五天时间。
    凤台坪管理区坚持劳动定额和评工记分制度，六年来取得了丰富经验，中共山西省委已指示全省各公社向他们学习。他们的主要经验，有以下几点：
    订好定额标准
    怎样制定劳动定额的标准？这个管理区的办法是：首先把全部农活按农事季节顺序排列起来，然后逐项依据一个中常劳力努力劳动一天，做到的数量、质量标准，确定为各项农活的劳动定额标准。制订计酬标准的办法是：根据各种农活的出力大小、技术高低等条件，分别排出技术重活、技术一般重活，以及一般活、一般轻活、轻活等十级。劳动定额标准和计酬标准，都是经过社员大会逐项讨论、修订的。社员们一致认为公道合理，干起活来有劲头。
    随后，又规定了修订劳动定额的办法。如凡是由于工具改革，技术提高等，需要新订或修订劳动定额时，由社（管理区）负责；凡是局部性的，由于作物生长不同、草大草小、地硬地软等条件不同，完成定额有难有易，需要调整定额时，由生产队负责在本队总定额工数的范围内进行调整。
    改进评工记分办法
    制订了劳动定额和计酬标准后的主要问题，是如何认真进行评工记分。一开始进行评工记分时，不是不啃气，就是吵半夜。有的是老按十分记工分，也有的是按劳力底分记工分；有的是当天评工当天记分，还有的三天、四天以后记一次工分。这时，有的社员说：“评工记分不公道，有定额和没定额一样。”
    党支部认为搞好评工记分是认真执行定额管理的一道关，于是在广大社员中展开了讨论。依靠大家讨论出了多种多样的评工记分办法：（一）地头评分。田间集体操作的农活，收工时就地检查，就地评分，就地记分，定期结算。（二）小 包工。凡是可以集体操作的活计，依据定额，包给作业小组，按期完成，验工记分。（三）直接按定额记分。可以固定专人操作的活计，如担粪、赶车、切草等，完成多少定额，直接记多少工分。（四）按时记分。如看场、看羊卧地等，都以时间记分。与此同时，党支部进一步加强了社员中的政治思想工作，社员的劳动自觉性有了很大的提高。由于广大社员有了这种自觉，所以每次评工记分，只用一两分钟，工分就评得公道合理。
    严格验收制度
    在执行评工记分制度的过程中，有一个时期，因为评工记分工作没有和验收制度结合起来，以致一部分社员做起活来，只管快，不管好。党支部针对这些情况，以具体事实对群众进行了教育，并掀起了群众性的提高农活质量的运动。几年来，行之有效的提高农活质量的根本办法是：在加强政治思想工作的基础上，加强验收制度。如做后一道工序的作业小组，检查前一道工序的质量；生产队按包工段落验收作业组的活；定期组织社员与社员、作业组与作业组、生产队与生产队之间的评比竞赛。
    反对浪费劳动工
    劳动日是实行按劳分配的依据。反对浪费劳动工，合理清理参加分配的劳动日，是促进社员关心生产和关心劳动日的又一个重要方面。凤台坪管理区，六年来，由每个劳动日分红二角钱，提高到现在除供给部分外，每个劳动日分红七角多钱，这里有一条极为重要的经验，就是严格控制非生产用工，合理地清理劳动日。这个管理区曾经有一个时期，使用劳动日比较混乱，当时有的社员认为，“劳动日不值钱了”，“多做劳动日也是白搭”。党支部发觉这个问题后，及时作了研究，并采取了紧急措施：
    （一）干部积极参加劳动，以生产领导生产。今年不到十个月时间，每人平均做到了二百多个劳动日。干部因公误工实行定额补贴劳动日，管理区主要干部的补贴工分不超过同等劳动力全年所做劳动日的五分之一，干部补贴工加管理费不超过总收入的2％。（二）基本建设用工不宜过多，一般以控制到全年劳动日总数的5％到10％为宜，而且主要应用于当年得利的基本建设。（三）县、公社临时调用劳力，要按城镇杂工工资发给管理区，管理区与管理区、生产队与生产队之间的协作工，要按等价交换的原则结算清楚。（四）国家义务工，按服劳力分摊。（五）娱乐、卫生等用工，全部利用休息时间，不记劳动日。（六）义务教员补贴工，由学员分摊；集体福利事业的服务人员用工，由公益金补贴一部分，自己生产自给一部分，有关人员分摊一部分。执行这些办法后，受到广大社员的拥护。
    保证分配兑现
    一方面合理清理劳动日，一方面保证分配兑现，这是坚持劳动定额评工记分制度的主要保证；同时，也是贯彻执行劳动定额评工记分制度的良好结果。凤台坪管理区不仅劳动日工值逐年提高，而且分配结束后，社员及时分到了现金。这样做了以后，干部经常轻松愉快，每年生产有头尾，工作经常是主动的；同时社员分到了现金，情绪很高，越劳动越有劲。
    这个管理区年年分配能兑现的主要经验是：（一）干部不借支款。在他们的影响下社员借支也极少；（二）节约开支，专款专用。公积金、公益金、管理费、生产费等，在制订了开支计划以后，由专人掌握，包干使用。同时，他们还注意安排困难户的收入。
