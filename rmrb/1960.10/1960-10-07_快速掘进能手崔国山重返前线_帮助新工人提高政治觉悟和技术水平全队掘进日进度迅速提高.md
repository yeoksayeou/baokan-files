(Our newspaper, Harbin, 6th) Cui Guoshan, a nationally renowned quick tunneling expert and former captain of the Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team at the Jixi Hengshan Coal Mine in Heilongjiang, recently returned to the team from his leadership position in the mine's construction section. These days, the members of the Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team are like tigers with wings, working with even greater enthusiasm. In the half-month since Cui Guoshan's return, the team's daily tunneling progress has increased by another 50%.

Cui Guoshan is returning to the tunneling front lines for the second time. The first time was in March 1958, after studying for four years at the Workers and Peasants' Rapid Completion Middle School and the Ministry of Coal Industry Cadre School, he returned to the tunneling team, leading the team to complete the annual state plan two months and six months ahead of schedule in the continuous Great Leap Forward years of 1958 and this year, respectively. Afterwards, due to work needs, Cui Guoshan was transferred to the Hengshan Mine as the deputy section chief of the construction section. After the launch of the increased production and thrift movement in August this year, the Party called on leading cadres to go deep into the grassroots. He immediately applied to the mine's Party committee to return to the tunneling front lines. The mine's Party committee approved his request, and he returned to the tunneling team as captain on September 6th.

On his first day back with the tunneling team, Cui Guoshan went down the mine with the team members. He worked alongside them, while also understanding the problems and key issues within the tunneling team. In order to meet the needs of the high-speed development of coal production, a large number of the team's veteran members had been promoted to section chiefs and captains to support other mines. New members have increased by nearly 80%. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to strengthen the political and ideological education of the team members and improve their high-speed tunneling technology.

In order to help workers quickly improve their quick tunneling skills such as drilling and blasting, Cui Guoshan often goes deep into the work face, teaching on-site while operating. When he was working in the No. 2 well, he found that the workers did not know how to determine the position and angle of the boreholes by looking at the direction of the coal seam. Originally, the coal roadway tunneling should have been cut at the bottom, but the workers were scooping at the waist, resulting in having to pull the bottom and press the top, which required more drilling and wasted gunpowder. Cui Guoshan immediately used the work face as a classroom, telling the workers how to determine the position and angle of the boreholes according to the specific situation of the coal seam, so that each blast could exert its due power, saving time and speeding up progress.

Cui Guoshan also often educates team members to pay attention to improving the quality of tunneling projects. One day, Cui Guoshan found that six consecutive props near the work face were tilted backwards at the 13th Deviation of the Third Layer, which did not meet the engineering quality requirements. The workers told him that the original props were not tilted, because this was a rock roadway, and the blasting power was strong, and the props would be shaken askew with each blast. Cui Guoshan then told everyone about the team's experience in creating a record in two months when it built more than 200 meters of rock roadway in the Second Right Deviation of the Fourth Layer in the past, and the engineering quality reached the first place in the Jixi Mining Bureau. At the same time, he pointed out that if you find the right leg socket for the prop and pay attention to the forward inclination when erecting the prop, it will not be shaken askew. While he was talking, he personally helped the workers repair those props. It only took two and a half hours to repair the six skewed props neatly, giving the workers a profound education on paying attention to engineering quality.

The Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team has been established since October 1951, and it has been nine years now. In these nine years, under the leadership of the Party, they have overcome many hanging cliffs and faults with selfless labor, experienced countless water-drenched areas, and successfully completed the tunneling tasks year after year, maintaining excellent results in fast tunneling, and have become an invincible underground vanguard. Soon after the team was established in 1951, the Cui Guoshan Team took the lead in creating a high-speed tunneling record, and then broke the record year after year. In 1958 and 1959, they successively won the high-speed tunneling awards from the Ministry of Coal Industry and the red flag awards from the province, prefecture, city, bureau, and mine for many times. They gloriously attended the National "Heroes Conference" and were praised as the "Rocket" Tunneling Team. On May 15 this year, they completed the annual state plan six and a half months ahead of schedule. Now, Cui Guoshan is leading all the team members to advance victoriously, determined to provide more and better coal mining working faces for a substantial increase in coal production.

    快速掘进能手崔国山重返前线  
    帮助新工人提高政治觉悟和技术水平全队掘进日进度迅速提高
    本报哈尔滨6日电　名驰全国的快速掘进能手、黑龙江鸡西恒山煤矿崔国山掘进队的老队长崔国山，最近从这个矿建设科的领导岗位回到了这个掘进队。这些天，崔国山掘进队的队员们真好比猛虎添翼，愈干愈欢，在崔国山归队后的半个月时间，全队掘进日进度又提高了50％。
    崔国山是第二次重返掘进前线了。第一次是在1958年3月，他从工农速成中学和煤炭工业部干部学校学习四年后回到了掘进队，带领着全队在连续大跃进的1958年和今年分别提前两个月和半年完成了全年国家计划。之后，因工作需要，崔国山被调到恒山矿担任建设科副科长的职务。今年8月，开展增产节约运动以后，党号召领导干部深入基层，他立即向矿党委申请重返掘进前线，矿党委批准了他的要求，他就于9月6日又回到掘进队担任队长了。
    崔国山回到掘进队的第一天，就和队员们一起下矿井了。他一面跟班劳动，一面了解掘进队里存在的问题和关键。为了适应煤炭生产高速度发展的需要，这个队里的大批老队员已被提升为段长、队长支援其他矿井了。新队员增加了近80％。因此，对队员的政治思想教育和提高高速掘进技术等方面的工作都急需加强起来。
    为了帮助工人们迅速提高打眼、放炮等快速掘进技术，崔国山经常深入掌子面，边操作边进行现场教学。他在二号井劳动时，发现工人们不会看煤层的走向来确定打眼位置和角度，本来煤巷掘进应该打底槽，工人们却去掏腰槽，结果还得拉底、压顶，既多打眼，又浪费火药。崔国山当时就把掌子面当课堂，告诉工人们应该怎样根据煤层的具体情况来确定打眼位置和角度，使每一眼炮都能发挥应有的威力，既节省时间，又加快进度。
    崔国山还经常教育队员们注意提高掘进工程质量。有一天，崔国山在三号层十三偏，发现靠近掌子面的接连六个棚子都向后歪斜，不符合工程质量要求。工人们告诉他，原来的棚子是不歪的，因为这里是岩石巷道，炮的力量大，一放炮就要把棚子震斜。崔国山就向大家讲述这个队过去打四号层二右偏的二百多米岩石巷道时，如何用两个月时间创造纪录，工程质量达到鸡西全矿务局第一的经验。同时指出：如果找好棚子的腿窝，搭棚子时注意向前倾斜度，就不会震斜。他一面讲，一面亲自动手和工人一起重修那几个棚子，仅花了两个半钟头，就把六个歪斜的棚子都修得整整齐齐，使工人们受了一次深刻的注意工程质量的教育。
    崔国山掘进队从1951年10月建立到现在已经九年了。在这九年中，他们在党的领导下，用忘我的劳动战胜了很多悬岩断层，经历了无数淋水成渠的顶水区，年年出色地完成掘进任务，一直保持着快速掘进的优异成绩，成为一支攻无不克的常胜地下尖兵。1951年建队不久，崔国山队就首创高速掘进纪录，之后又年年刷新纪录，1958年和1959年连续荣获全国煤炭工业部的高速掘进奖励和省、地、市、局、矿多次红旗奖励，光荣地出席了全国“群英会”，被人们誉为“火箭”掘进队。今年5月15日，他们又提前六个半月完成了全年国家计划。现在，崔国山正带领着全体队员乘胜前进，决心为煤炭大幅度增产提供更多更好的采煤工作面。
