Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 24th: The Laotian Fighting Forces Radio broadcast today a letter from all commanders and fighters of the Second Battalion of the Laotian Fighting Forces to officers and soldiers of the Royal Army. The letter called on the officers and soldiers of the Royal Army to join the Laotian Fighting Forces in defending the motherland and the people, and to resolutely oppose the main enemies of the Laotian nation, US imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan clique.

The letter said, "The current struggle in Laos is a struggle between two forces: on one side are all the Lao people, and on the other side are the US imperialist aggressors and their running dog, the Phoumi Nosavan clique." The letter said that the Lao people, who are fighting heroically for the right to live and die, will never accept the continued oppression of US imperialism, and are determined to fight for democratic and free rights, to oppose the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique's expansion of the civil war, and to strive for the peaceful construction of the motherland.

The letter pointed out that many officers and soldiers who were coerced, deceived and seduced by the traitorous clique have risen up against the traitorous clique and expressed their loyalty to the Royal Government. In many places such as Luang Prabang, Xieng Khouang, Khammouane, Savannakhet and Lower Laos, the Royal Army has contacted the Laotian Fighting Forces, agreed to cease hostilities and conflicts, guaranteed the freedom rights of the people, and jointly supported the Phouma government to oppose the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique. The Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, the running dog of US imperialism, has been opposed and spurned by the people.

The letter pointed out that the Phoumi Nosavan clique is blatantly betraying the motherland, the legitimate government and the people of the whole country, is promoting the division of the motherland and the continuation of the civil war, and is turning Laos into a colony and military base of US imperialism. "They are doing everything possible to buy over and seduce some senior officers of the Royal Army, turning them into 'two-headed snakes', instructing them to pretend to be loyal to the government in order to serve the Phoumi Nosavan clique's traitorous plans."

The letter said, "Concrete evidence is that Colonel Kham Kong, as a government official, has arrested Major Da Nong, who was sent by the government to Sam Neua to command the Sam Neua army. Lieutenant Colonel Kham Hou and Major Van Bo, who had declared their loyalty to the government, also betrayed the government on October 9th. Some officers in the First Military Region are closely colluding with the Phoumi Nosavan-Kampan Banya traitorous clique, besieging and coercing the King, attacking the Laotian Fighting Forces, carrying out 'sweeps' in Phongsaly and Sayaboury, suppressing the people, and preparing for betrayal activities in Luang Prabang. On October 16th, the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Army, Van Rathikone, met with the traitorous clique to discuss plans to betray the motherland."

The letter appealed, "Dear officers and soldiers of the Royal Army, you are facing two roads: one is the road of following US imperialism and betraying the motherland and the people by the Phoumi Nosavan clique; the other is the road of national peace and neutrality and national harmony."

The letter said, "You must be concerned about the fate of the motherland. You must resolutely respond to the call of the motherland, turn back and support Prince Souvanna Phouma's government's line of national harmony, and support and demand that the Souvanna Phouma government implement a genuine policy of peace and neutrality."

The letter concluded, "We, the commanders and fighters of the Second Battalion of the Laotian Fighting Forces, are always ready to give you sincere and cordial cooperation on the above basis, and to work with you to carry out the noble task entrusted to us by the motherland, that is, to defend the motherland, defend the people, and resolutely oppose the main enemies of the Laotian nation, the US imperialist interventionists and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique."

    寮国战斗部队第二营指战员致函王国军队官兵
    号召行动起来坚决反对叛国集团
    据新华社河内24日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播了寮国战斗部队第二营全体指挥员、战斗员给王国军队官兵的一封信。信中号召王国军队官兵和寮国战斗部队一起保卫祖国和人民，坚决反对老挝民族的主要敌人美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万集团。
    这封信说，“老挝当前的斗争是两种力量之间的斗争：一边是全体老挝人民，另一边是美帝国主义侵略者和它的走狗富米·诺萨万集团。”信件说，为争取生死存亡的权利而英勇斗争的老挝人民绝不要美帝国主义的继续压迫，决心为争取民主自由权利而进行斗争，为反对富米·诺萨万卖国集团扩大内战，为了和平建设祖国而斗争。
    信件指出，许多受叛国集团强迫、欺骗和引诱的官兵们，已经起来反对叛国集团，并表示忠诚于王国政府。在琅勃拉邦、川圹、甘蒙、沙湾拿吉和下寮的许多地方，王国军队已同寮国战斗部队接触，同意停止敌对行动和冲突，保证人民的自由权利，共同支持富马政府，反对富米·诺萨万叛国集团。美帝国主义的走狗富米·诺萨万叛国集团遭到了人民的反对和唾弃。
    信中指出，富米·诺萨万集团明目张胆地背叛祖国，背叛合法政府和全国人民，正在促进分裂祖国继续内战，把老挝变成美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地。“它们正在千方百计地收买和引诱王国军队的一些高级军官，把它们变成‘两头蛇’，指使他们装做忠于政府的样子以便于为富米·诺萨万集团的叛国计划服务。”
    信中说，“具体的证据是，作为政府人员的坎功大校已经逮捕政府派到桑怒指挥桑怒军队的达农少校。曾经宣布忠于政府的坎户中校和万宝少校10月9日也背叛了政府。第一军区的一些军官密切地勾结富米·诺萨万—坎番·班雅叛国集团，包围和逼迫国王，向寮国战斗部队进攻，在丰沙里和沙耶布里进行‘扫荡’，镇压人民，在琅勃拉邦准备背叛活动。王国军队总司令万·拉迪功10月16日曾经同叛国集团会晤，讨论背叛祖国的计划。”
    信件呼吁说，“亲爱的王国军队官兵们，你们正面对两条道路：一条是富米·诺萨万集团跟从美帝国主义，背叛祖国和人民的道路；另一条是民族的和平中立和民族和睦的道路。”
    信中说，“你们要关心祖国的命运。你们要坚决响应祖国的召唤，回头来支持梭发那·富马亲王政府民族和睦的路线，支持和要求梭发那·富马政府实现真正的和平中立政策。”
  信件最后说，“我们寮国战斗部队第二营指战员随时准备在上述基础上，给你们以诚意的、亲切的合作，和你们一起执行祖国交给我们的高贵的任务，即保卫祖国，保卫人民，坚决反对老挝民族的主要敌人美帝国主义干涉者和富米·诺萨万叛国集团。”
