Xinhua News Agency, 11th — The All-China Students' Federation today sent a telegram to the First All-African Students' Conference, to be held in London on the 12th, warmly congratulating the conference's opening.

The All-China Students' Federation's telegram stated: "The African national independence movement is surging like a storm. The heroic struggle of the African people and African students against imperialism and colonialism has powerfully struck at imperialist colonial rule. Chinese students firmly support your just struggle.

"Imperialism is not reconciled to its defeat, and it is doing everything possible to maintain its colonial rule. U.S. imperialism is invading Africa. On the one hand, it intensifies its plunder and interference under the guise of 'aid' to underdeveloped countries; on the other hand, it incites Africans to fight Africans in order to disintegrate and suppress the African national democratic struggle and replace old colonialism. The recent criminal activities of U.S. imperialism in using the United Nations to invade and interfere in the Congo further prove that it is the most ferocious enemy of the African people and the people of the world. In the situation of broad unity and resolute struggle of the people of the world, it is in an unprecedentedly isolated position. We believe that as long as African students and people unite closely with the people of the world, persist in struggle, and heighten their vigilance, they will certainly be able to defeat the aggressive policies and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States, win and maintain national independence, and defend world peace.

"May the friendship between Chinese and African students develop daily in the common struggle against imperialism, colonialism, for national independence, and in defense of world peace."

    中国学生坚决支持非洲民族独立运动
    全国学联电贺第一次全非学生大会
    新华社11日讯　中华全国学生联合会今天打电报给12日将在伦敦举行的第一次全非学生大会，热烈祝贺大会的召开。
    全国学联的电报说：“非洲的民族独立运动有如风起云涌，非洲人民和非洲学生反对帝国主义、殖民主义的英勇斗争，有力地打击了帝国主义殖民统治，中国学生坚决支持你们的正义斗争。
    “帝国主义是不甘心于自己的失败的，他们正千方百计地维持它的殖民统治。美帝国主义正在侵入非洲，它一方面以‘援助’不发达国家为名，加紧掠夺和干涉，另一方面策动非洲人打非洲人，以便瓦解和镇压非洲的民族民主斗争，取代老殖民主义。最近美帝国主义利用联合国名义侵略和干涉刚果的罪恶活动，更进一步证明了它是非洲人民和全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。在全世界人民广泛团结、坚决斗争的形势下，它已经处于空前孤立的境地。我们相信，只要非洲学生和人民同全世界人民紧密团结，坚持斗争，提高警惕，就一定能击败以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，赢得和维护民族独立，保卫住世界和平。
    “祝中国和非洲学生之间的友谊在反对帝国主义、殖民主义、争取民族独立、保卫世界和平的共同斗争中日益发展。”
