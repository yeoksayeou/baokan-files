Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 24th. The Cuban newspaper "Revolución" published an editorial today, strongly condemning the United States' conspiracy to invade Cuba. Commenting on the invasion plans against Cuba put forward by US Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy and Republican presidential candidate Nixon during the election campaign, the editorial pointed out that the US government is carrying out invasion preparations against Cuba in Guatemala and the United States.

The editorial emphasized that Cuba is not isolated. Supporting Cuba are the people of all Latin American countries, all colonial and oppressed people around the world, the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, as well as Arab and African countries. The editorial also said that if imperialism foolishly launches a direct invasion of Cuba despite all this, it will bear all the consequences.

The editorial said that Cuba hopes for peace in order to carry out construction. However, whoever attempts to prevent Cuba from peaceful construction will be met with a head-on blow from a people as solid as a rock, united and determined to pay a high price for their ideals.

    古巴“革命报”谴责美国侵略
    指出一切进步力量都支持古巴
    新华社哈瓦那24日电　古巴“革命报”今天发表社论，强烈谴责美国侵略古巴的阴谋。社论在评论美国民主党总统候选人肯尼迪和共和党总统候选人尼克松在竞选中提出的侵略古巴的计划时指出，美国政府正在危地马拉和美国进行着对古巴的侵略准备。
    社论强调指出，但是，古巴并不孤立。支持古巴的有拉丁美洲的各国人民以及全世界一切殖民地和被压迫人民，有以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家，以及阿拉伯国家和非洲国家。社论又说，假如帝国主义竟不顾这一切愚蠢地发动对古巴的直接侵略，一切后果将由它来承担。
    社论说，古巴希望和平，以便进行建设。但是，谁要企图使古巴不能和平建设，他就要遭到坚如磐石般团结一致并决心为了自己的理想不惜付出高昂代价的人民的迎头痛击。
