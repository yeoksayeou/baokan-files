Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou Electric Dispatch: The Zhengzhou Heavy Machinery Plant has mobilized the masses to offer suggestions and ideas for product revolution, focusing on its main product – diesel engines – and has achieved remarkable results. The cost per diesel engine in the third quarter decreased by 23.3% compared to the first quarter, and 43.5% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The consumption of raw materials and man-hours also decreased by 31.8% to 53.3% respectively compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The efficiency of the diesel engines has also increased from the original 20 horsepower per unit to over 25 horsepower.

Over the past nine months, all factory workers have put forward more than 200 innovation proposals centered on modifying product structure, saving man-hours and materials, and improving product quality. More than 90 of these proposals have been implemented, further eliminating some ineffective parts in the products. Stamping has replaced metal cutting in over 50 parts, saving over 40% of processing time. While ensuring product quality, workers have also used fewer and more common materials to produce completely qualified new products.

All factory workers have also adopted the method of "three-way combination" inside and outside the factory to modify product design. Twelve "three-way combination" groups composed of leading cadres, workers, and technicians have been linked up with user departments, specialized colleges, and scientific research departments to conduct extensive experiments. This has made the design modification work proceed quickly and steadily, ensuring both high output and improved product quality.

    郑州重型机器厂狠抓产品革命
    新柴油机用料省效能高
    据新华社郑州电　郑州重型机器厂发动群众针对主要产品——柴油机，献计献策，进行产品革命，已经取得了显著成果。第三季度每台柴油机的成本，比第一季度下降23.3％，比去年第四季度下降43.5％；原料材料和工时消耗，也比去年第四季度分别减少了31.8％到53.3％；柴油机的效能也由原来每台二十马力提高到二十五马力以上。
    九个多月以来，全厂职工围绕着修改产品结构、节约工时、材料和提高产品质量这个中心，提出革新建议达二百多条，实现了九十多条，进一步去除了产品中的一些不起作用的部件，并在五十多个部件上实现了以冲压代替金属切削加工，节约加工工时达40％以上。职工们还在保证产品质量的前提下，用更少的和普通的材料，做出完全合格的新产品。
    全厂职工还采取厂内、厂外“三结合”的方法修改产品设计。由领导干部、工人、技术人员组成的十二个“三结合”小组，与使用部门、专科学院及科学研究部门，挂钩结合，大搞试验。这样就使修改设计的工作进行得既快又稳，既保证了高产又提高了产品质量。
