    Zeng Laoliu Braved the Rain to Save Vegetable Seedlings in the Middle of the Night
    This year, our commune planted a particularly large amount of autumn vegetables. The seedlings sprouted and grew tender and green. One night, a torrential rain suddenly fell, and some people worried that it would damage some of the vegetable fields. The next day, when everyone went to the vegetable fields, they saw that the drainage ditches of each vegetable plot had been opened, and there was no standing water in the vegetable fields. After the rain, the sky cleared, and the seedlings grew even fresher and more lovely than before the rain.
    Who braved the rain to get up in the middle of the night to drain the water from the vegetable plots? It turned out to be the old vegetable farmer Zeng Laoliu. Zeng Laoliu is fifty-eight years old this year and is a skilled vegetable grower. He knows that newly sprouted vegetable seedlings are like newborn babies, and they must be cared for doubly to grow well. Therefore, when he heard it raining outside, he hurriedly got up to drain the water.
    Zeng Laoliu often says: "Growing vegetables is like growing flowers, you must manage them at all times." In managing the vegetable fields, he insisted on diligent weeding, diligent watering, and diligent fertilizing, and achieved a bumper harvest of both spring and summer vegetables. Now, there are no weeds to be seen in the autumn vegetable fields he manages. His exemplary actions have motivated the vast number of commune members to carefully manage vegetables. In August, the total vegetable harvest of the entire commune exceeded the original plan by more than three times.

    曾老六半夜冒雨救菜苗
    我们公社今年种的秋菜特别多，菜苗出土了，长得又嫩又绿。一天夜里忽然下起了倾盆大雨，有人担心会损坏一些菜田。第二天，大家到菜田一看，每个菜畦的地沟都放开了，菜田里没有一点积水，雨过天晴，菜苗长得比雨前更鲜嫩可爱了。
    是谁冒雨在半夜里起来放了菜畦的积水呢？原来是老菜农曾老六。曾老六今年五十八岁，是个种菜能手，他深知刚出土的菜苗，就像刚出生的婴儿一样，要加倍爱护才能很好地成长起来，所以他听到外边下雨，就紧忙着起床去放水。
    曾老六常常说：“种菜如种花，要时时管理它”。他在管理菜田中，坚持勤锄草、勤浇水、勤施肥，不论春菜、夏菜都获得了丰收。现在，在他管的秋菜地里见不到杂草。他的模范行动，带动了广大社员都精心管理蔬菜，8月份全公社的蔬菜收获量超过原计划三倍多。
