    West Germany Intensifies Arms Expansion; Troop Strength Exceeds 270,000
    Bonn Authorities Clamor to Equip West German Navy with Nuclear Weapons
    (Reported by this newspaper) The West German government is stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations. According to an announcement by the West German Ministry of Defense in early October, the number of West German "Defense Forces" has now reached 276,000. This figure represents four-fifths of the original military construction plan of 350,000 personnel.
    In the first few days of October this year, 41,600 young West Germans enlisted for military service. Currently, the West German "Defense Forces" consist of 172,000 army personnel, 64,000 air force personnel, 24,000 navy personnel, and a total of 16,000 personnel in the "Territorial Defense Forces" and central military departments.
    Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, October 26th: The Munich "German Weekly" published today reveals that the West German government, under the guise of "training," is greatly increasing the tonnage and number of West German naval vessels.
    The Brussels Protocol stipulates that West German submarines should not exceed 350 tons, and warships should not exceed 3,000 tons. However, among the three submarines currently used by West Germany for "training," one, named "Wilhelm Bauer," weighs 1,817 tons. At the same time, among the "training ships" used by the West German Naval Academy, there is also a warship weighing as much as 6,000 tons, which will be launched in Rendsburg on November 5th this year. This warship is equipped with torpedoes, anti-submarine weapons, and ten cannons. The "German Weekly" pointed out that this is actually a cruiser.
    Since the United States planned to equip the armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with "Polaris" nuclear missiles, West Germany has been more actively preparing to equip its navy with nuclear weapons. The Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces, U.S. General Norstad, submitted a "proposal" to the London headquarters of the Western European Union of Seven in August, requesting that the tonnage of West German naval vessels be relaxed. Subsequently, the Bonn authorities have been constantly clamoring for the construction of high-tonnage ships in order to carry nuclear weapons.

### 西德加紧扩军　兵力已逾27万  波恩当局叫嚣要用核武器装备西德海军

    西德加紧扩军　兵力已逾27万
    波恩当局叫嚣要用核武器装备西德海军
    本报讯　西德政府正在加紧扩军备战。据西德国防部10月初公布，西德“国防军”的人数现在已经达到二十七万六千人。这个数字达到原定建军计划三十五万人的五分之四。
    在今年10月份的最初几天，就有四万一千六百名西德青年入伍服兵役。目前西德“国防军”中有陆军十七万二千人，空军六万四千人，海军二万四千人，“地方防御军”和中央军事部门的人员共一万六千人。
    据新华社波恩26日电　今天出版的慕尼黑“德意志周报”揭露说，西德政府以“教练”为名，在大大增加西德海军舰只的吨位和数量。
    布鲁塞尔议定书规定，西德的潜艇吨位不准超过三百五十吨，军舰不准超过三千吨。但是，现在西德“教练”用的三艘潜水艇中就有一艘名叫“威廉—鲍尔”号的重一千八百十七吨。同时，供西德海军军官学校使用的“教练舰”中，还有一艘重达六千吨的军舰将在今年11月5日在伦茨堡下水。这艘军舰上装有鱼雷、反潜艇武器和十门大炮。“德意志周报”指出，这实际上是一艘巡洋舰。
    自从美国计划以“北极星”式核导弹来装备北大西洋集团的武装部队以来，西德就更加积极地准备用核武器装备它的海军。北大西洋集团军队总司令、美国将军诺斯塔德8月间曾向七国西欧联盟伦敦总部提出一项“建议”，要求放宽西德建造海军舰只的吨位。接着，波恩当局就不断叫嚣要建造高吨位的舰艇以便携带核武器。
