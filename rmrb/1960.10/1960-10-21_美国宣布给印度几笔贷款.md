Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 20th: The U.S. government has recently announced a series of loans to the Indian government, intensifying its economic infiltration of India.

According to the "Hindustan Standard" on the 17th, after the Indian government stated that there was no difference in product prices between foreign private capital fertilizer plants and Indian public fertilizer plants, the United States announced on the 14th that it agreed to lend 30 million U.S. dollars to the Indian government for a fertilizer plant planned to be built in Trombay near Bombay. In addition, it will provide loans equivalent to 28 million U.S. dollars in U.S. government-owned rupees.

According to the "Times of India" in New Delhi on the 16th, four American companies have expressed their willingness to cooperate with Indian companies to build fertilizer plants.

The report also said that it has been recognized in principle that new private factories have the right to sell products on the open market, and prices are not subject to control.

According to the Press Trust of India, the U.S. government announced on the 19th that it agreed to provide another $25 million loan to the Indian government. This loan will be allocated by the U.S. Development Loan Fund to purchase equipment to increase the production capacity of small and medium-sized private industrial enterprises in metallurgical power equipment, machine tools, and chemicals.

The "Indian Express" also reported that the Indian government reached an agreement with the U.S. government in late September to sell 2.5 million tons of corn to India by the U.S. government. The newspaper also said that India will also receive 4,000 tons of soybean oil and 2 million pounds of tobacco from the United States.

Recently, the first "aid" from the United States to the Indian government as funding for India's Third Five-Year Plan is 250 million U.S. dollars.

    据新德里的“印度时报”16日报道，已经有四家美国公司表示愿意同印度公司合作兴建肥料厂。

    另据印度报业托辣斯报道，美国政府19日宣布同意向印度政府提供另一笔二千五百万美元的贷款。这笔贷款将由美国开发贷款基金会拨出，用来购买设备以增加中小型私营工业企业在冶金电力设备、工作母机和化学制品等方面的生产能力。
    “印度快报”还报道说，印度政府在9月下旬同美国政府达成了一项由美国政府售给印度两千五百万吨玉蜀黍的协议。这家报纸还说，印度还将从美国得到四千吨豆油和两百万磅烟草。
