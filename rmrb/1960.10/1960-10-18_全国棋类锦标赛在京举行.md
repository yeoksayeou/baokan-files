　　National Chess Championships Held in Beijing

　　Xinhua News Agency, October 17th. The 1960 National Chess Championships began on the 16th at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. Over 200 chess players from 25 provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and the People's Liberation Army are competing in Chinese Chess team matches, Go and International Chess individual matches, and junior and women's exhibition matches.

　　In the first round of the Chinese Chess team matches, the most notable event was the defeat of Heilongjiang player Wang Jialiang, who has won the national runner-up title three times, by Zhang Pinshan from Henan. Another main player of the Heilongjiang team, Zhu Guisen, was also defeated by Liu Wansheng from Henan after a hard-fought four hours. Therefore, the Heilongjiang team, which was considered to have a good chance of entering the top three, lost 1-5 in the first round.

　　A total of 50 chess players are participating in this national Go competition, which is one and a half times more than last year. In the first round of the 16th, the veterans mostly maintained their stability, but the strength of the new players was also amazing.

　　For example, Shao Futang from Hubei, who ranked eighth in the first National Games last year, lost to Jiang Zhongying, a newcomer from Hunan. Du Junliang from Sichuan, who is participating in the national competition for the first time, also won against Zhang Chengquan, a veteran from Shandong.

　　In the International Chess competition, with 49 chess players participating, the first round on the 16th also saw new players defeating veterans. Li Zhu from Jiangsu, who is eighteen years old, defeated Ji Xiangli from Jilin, who ranked seventh in last year's National Games. Xu Xiaoming from Beijing won against Xu Hongshun from Shanghai, the national runner-up in 1958.

    全国棋类锦标赛在京举行
    新华社17日讯　1960年全国棋类锦标赛16日开始在北京劳动人民文化宫举行。二十五个省、市、自治区和解放军代表队的二百多名棋手，分别在中国象棋团体赛、围棋和国际象棋个人赛、少年和女子表演赛中展开较量。
    在中国象棋团体赛的第一轮中，最引人注意的是曾经三次获得全国亚军的黑龙江棋手王嘉良，败于河南的张聘三。黑龙江队另一主力棋手朱桂森在苦斗了四个小时后，也被河南的刘万胜杀败。因此，被认为很有进入前三名可能的黑龙江队，在第一轮中就以一比五失利。
    参加这次全国围棋比赛的共有五十名棋手，这比去年增加了一倍半。在16日的第一轮比赛中，老将们的成绩大都保持稳定，但新手力量也很惊人。
    例如去年第一届全国运动会第八名的湖北邵福棠，败给了湖南新手姜仲英。初次参加全国性比赛的四川杜君梁，也赢了山东宿将张成铨。
    四十九名棋手参加的国际象棋比赛，16日在第一轮中也出现了新手战胜老将的情况。江苏十八岁的李铸，战胜了去年全运会第七名吉林纪祥礼。北京徐孝明，赢了1958年全国亚军上海许宏顺。
