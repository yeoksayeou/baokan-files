Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch: Japanese fascist thugs, under the protection of the Liberal Democratic Party, brazenly invaded the Diet and intimidated Socialist Party leaders.

On the afternoon of the 24th, five fascist thugs, including Takatsu Daitaro, belonging to the "Yamaguchi Niro (the assassin of Inejiro Asanuma) Relief Association," broke into the Diet and forcibly demanded to meet with Eda Saburo, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, and Narita Tomomi, Chairman of the Policy Deliberation Council, lodging a "protest" against the Socialist Party for exposing their criminal activities.

Upon investigation, they all possessed entry permits issued by the Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party.

At a joint meeting of the Legal Affairs and Local Administration Committees of the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet on the 24th, Socialist Party member Sakagami Yasutaro exposed this incident.

Sakagami strongly denounced at the meeting that while the Diet was deliberating on important issues related to public security, the Liberal Democratic Party actually allowed such individuals to run rampant inside the Diet building.

    日本法西斯暴徒胆大包天
    竟公然闯进国会恫吓社会党领导人
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本法西斯暴徒在自由民主党的包庇下公然闯进国会，恐吓社会党领导人。
    24日下午，高津大太郎等五名属于“山口二矢（刺杀浅沼稻次郎的凶手）救援会”的法西斯暴徒闯进国会，强迫要求会见社会党书记长江田三郎、政策审议会会长成田知已，对揭露了它们的罪恶活动的社会党提出了“抗议”。
    经过查问，他们都持有由自由民主党干事长发给的入门证。
    在24日举行的日本国会众议院法务、地方行政委员会联席会议上，社会党议员阪上安太郎揭露了这个事件。
    阪上在会上强烈指责，在国会正在审议有关治安的重大问题时，自由民主党竟容许这种人物在国会大厦里面横行。
