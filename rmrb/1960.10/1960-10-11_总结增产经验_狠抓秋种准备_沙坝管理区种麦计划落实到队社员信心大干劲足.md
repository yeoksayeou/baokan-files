Summarize Experiences in Increasing Production, Vigorously Grasp Autumn Planting Preparations
Shaba Management District's Wheat Planting Plan Implemented to Teams; Commune Members Confident and Energetic

Kunming, October 10th (reported by this newspaper) - The Shaba Management District of Banqiao Commune in Baoshan County, Yunnan Province, has mobilized the masses to summarize the experiences of previous years' early spring production, and arranged early spring planting according to local conditions, so that the early spring sowing plan was quickly implemented to the teams and groups, strengthening the confidence of cadres and the masses in striving for increased early spring production.

In recent years, the cadres and masses of this management district have accumulated a lot of experience and lessons in implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. Before the autumn planting, they carefully summarized past experiences, formulated measures according to local conditions, and put next year's early spring production on a reliable foundation. Commune members of the First Production Team introduced the following situation at a discussion meeting: Two plots of land in the team are connected by a ridge, and were originally the same soil color, but now one plot is blackish-yellow, and the other is blackish-oily; one plot is easy to plow, and the other is difficult to plow; the yield of one plot is high for both early and late spring, and the yield of the other plot is low. The reason is that one plot implements a bean-wheat rotation, and the other has been planted with wheat every year since 1953, and the soil is becoming increasingly compacted due to insufficient fertilizer application. In the summary, everyone also mentioned that some people in the past isolatedly emphasized the stability of wheat yield, without combining soil, climate and other natural conditions, and planted wheat in a type of "night tide soil," because the groundwater level of this type of field is high, and the wheat planted did not grow well. Through mass summary, the management district has found the following rules for early spring production:

1.  The success or failure of early spring planting is not only related to the yield of early spring, but also has a great relationship with the increase in production of late spring. In 1958, when the entire management district planted early spring crops, one-fourth of the cultivated land was deep-plowed, heavily fertilized, and rationally densely planted, which not only increased early spring production, but also reduced weeds and insects in the fields in the second year, and also achieved a bumper harvest in late spring.

2.  The variety of early spring crops should be arranged according to the nature of the soil. The local people's experience is "wheat is planted in bone, beans are planted in meat" - bone refers to dry and loose soil with low groundwater level, and meat refers to moist soil with high groundwater level. If beans are planted in dry fields, they will grow sparsely and thin, resulting in low yields; if wheat is planted in moist fields, the growing season will be prolonged, which will affect the plowing and soil drying of late spring.

Based on the above experience, the management district decided to arrange broad beans to be planted in rusty water fields, low-lying fields, and riverside fields, and wheat to be planted in dry, sunny fields. Arranging crops according to the soil can achieve adaptation to local conditions for each plot. The masses are very satisfied with this arrangement, believing that they are confident in planting early spring crops well.

After summarizing many years of experience in early spring production, autumn harvesting and planting work has been greatly promoted. Cadres and the masses have a clear understanding of the laws of early spring production, and therefore are grasping it firmly. The entire management district has prepared more than 90% of the required fertilizer, and some teams transport a load of fertilizer to the field after harvesting each plot. In order to seize the autumn planting season, the progress of autumn harvesting has also been greatly accelerated, and it is being done while harvesting and planting. In previous years, this time was the autumn harvest, but this year, several hundred acres of broad beans have already been planted. (Attached picture)

    总结增产经验　狠抓秋种准备
    沙坝管理区种麦计划落实到队社员信心大干劲足
    本报昆明10日电　云南省保山县板桥公社沙坝管理区，通过发动群众，总结历年的小春生产经验，因时因地制宜安排小春种植，使小春播种计划很快落实到队、到组，加强了干部和群众力争小春增产的信心。
    几年来，这个管理区的干部和群众对贯彻农业“八字宪法”积累了很多经验和教训。在秋种前，他们认真总结了已往的经验，因地制宜地制定措施，把明年小春增产放在可靠的基础上。第一生产队社员在座谈会上介绍了这样一个情况：本队有两丘田隔埂相连，原来是一样土色，而现在一丘是黑黄色，一丘是黑油色，一丘好犁，一丘难犁，一丘大、小春产量都高，一丘产量都低。原因就是一丘实行豆麦轮作，一丘自从1953年以来年年种麦子，再加上肥料施的不足，土壤越来越板结了。在总结中，大家还谈到，有的人过去孤立地强调小麦产量稳定，不结合土壤、气候等自然条件，就在一种“夜潮土”里种麦子，因这种田地下水位高，种的麦子就长不好。经过群众性的总结，管理区对小春生产摸出这样几条规律：
    一、小春种得好坏，不仅关系到小春的产量，对大春的增产也有很大关系。全管理区在1958年种小春时，有四分之一的耕地实行了深翻，多施肥，合理密植，不仅使小春增产，而且第二年田里草少了，虫也少了，大春也得到丰收。
    二、要根据土壤的性质来安排小春作物品种。当地群众的经验是“麦种骨头，豆点肉”——骨头指土壤干松、地下水位低的田，肉指土壤湿润地下水位高的田。豆若是点在干燥的田里，长得又稀又瘦，产量低；麦子种在湿润的田里，生长期延长，会影响大春的翻犁和晒垡。
    这个管理区根据上述经验，决定把锈水田、低洼田、河边田等安排种蚕豆，干燥的、向阳的田安排种麦子。根据土壤安排作物，就能做到丘丘因地制宜。群众对这样安排都很满意，认为这样就有把握把小春种好。
    经过总结多年的小春生产经验，大大促进了秋收秋种工作。干部和群众对小春生产规律看得准了，因而抓得也狠了。全管理区已准备好了占需要数90％以上的肥料，有的队是收一丘，就运一丘肥料到田里。为了抓住秋种季节，秋收进度也大大加快，并且做到边收、边种。往年此时正在秋收，今年此时，已种下了几百亩蚕豆。（附图片）
