Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd, New York: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee began discussing the disarmament issue on the 19th. At the meeting, US Representative Wadsworth once again resorted to empty talk about "disarmament" to cover up the US's true colors of arms expansion and war preparations. His speech was sternly condemned by Soviet Representative Zorin.

Zorin spoke first at the morning session. He said that despite the painful experience of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee and the highly unreliable speeches of the representatives of the United States and its allies in the General Assembly's general debate, the Soviet Union is still willing to make another attempt to reach an agreement with Western countries on the issue of disarmament.

Zorin then described in detail the content of each stage of the Soviet disarmament plan, and pointed out that in order to ensure that the forces composed of police provided by various countries under the disposal of the Security Council after the realization of complete and thorough disarmament can guarantee the security of various countries, the structure of the United Nations Secretariat and the Security Council must be changed.

Zorin emphasized that the Soviet Union has always done everything possible in the past and present to make the comprehensive and thorough disarmament negotiations a success. However, if Western countries evade drafting a comprehensive and thorough disarmament treaty again, and if they use disarmament negotiations to deceive the people of all countries as they have done repeatedly in the past, then the Soviet delegation will not participate in such a despicable act.

Zorin pointed out that there are already signs that Western countries are trying to mislead the negotiations. Immediately after the Soviet proposal was put forward, Western countries hurriedly put forward two proposals: the US-British-Italian proposal and the British proposal. These two proposals are aimed at diverting the negotiations from drafting a comprehensive and thorough disarmament treaty to endless and aimless debates on the technical details of arms supervision. The Western plan only calls for supervision measures for existing armaments—primarily rockets—and does not address the disbanding of all armed forces, the abolition of national military organizational machines, the cessation of arms production and military allocations, or the withdrawal of military bases on foreign territories.

Zorin pointed out that if the United States and its allies continue to adhere to their negative position, the work of the First Committee cannot be effective, and it goes without saying that the Soviet Union will not waste its time in vain.

In his speech, US Representative Wadsworth tried to conceal the US's consistent position of delaying and undermining disarmament negotiations for more than ten years, and spoke empty words about the US "intending... to go to the end along the road of real disarmament." In order to defend the US's active arms expansion and war preparations, which does not want disarmament at all, Wadsworth shamelessly fabricated the so-called "history of the Soviet Union," slandering the Soviet Union for always using its superior armed forces to "impose the Soviet system" on others, and falsely accused the Soviet Union of attempting to "use the military advantages arising from unbalanced disarmament plans to achieve its further expansionist goals." Wadsworth clamored that the United States "will never sign any agreement that leads to this result."

Wadsworth flatly rejected the disarmament proposal submitted by the Soviet Union to the Political Committee, and he also distorted the facts, saying that the Soviet Union's proposal for comprehensive and thorough disarmament meant the so-called "inability to take any action in the field of disarmament."

When talking about the US's "basic principles and considerations" on the disarmament issue, Wadsworth reiterated the US's attempt to use protracted disarmament negotiations to deceive the world and cover up the US's policy of vigorously expanding arms and preparing for war. He emphasized that disarmament is a "difficult problem" that contains "all kinds of extremely complex problems and technical problems" and "cannot be achieved by passing resolutions or reaching agreement on wording that conceals fundamental disputes." Wadsworth repeatedly emphasized that disarmament negotiations "will be a long and arduous process" and that "the only way is to return to the negotiating table" for "patient and possibly lengthy negotiations." Wadsworth also clamored that the United States would not be "intimidated" by the Soviet Union's statement that it would not continue to participate in negotiations that deceive the people when necessary.

Wadsworth once again played the usual trick of obstructing disarmament with so-called international supervision at the meeting. He clamored that the United States believes that one of the prerequisites for "any feasible disarmament plan must" be "adequate inspection and verification methods." Starting from the aggressive policy of US imperialism, he wantonly slandered socialist countries as so-called "closed societies," and under the pretext of "preventing surprise attacks," he wanted to establish a so-called "open world" in order to conduct espionage reconnaissance activities against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in the name of so-called international inspection and supervision. Wadsworth clamored that the United States cannot "abolish supervision or take shortcuts on the issue of supervision."

British Representative Ormsby-Gore defended the British proposal to establish a committee of experts on disarmament issues in his speech. The purpose of this British proposal is to delay the resolution of the disarmament issue and retrace the old path on the disarmament issue.

Canadian Foreign Minister Green spoke at the meeting, trying his best to defend the position of Western countries.

Pakistani Representative Bato, who spoke at the meeting, supported the "disarmament" proposal of Western countries. Bato also attacked the Soviet Union's solemn position of expressing that it would not participate in the Western countries' trick of deceiving the people through negotiations, and nonsensically claimed that the Soviet Union "has no right to make acceptance of its demands a condition for participating in the meeting."

Zorin spoke again before the end of the afternoon session. He emphasized that there are profound differences between socialist countries and Western countries on the issue of disarmament. He said that we advocate comprehensive and thorough disarmament under effective international supervision. The United States and its allies have once again proved in the speeches of their representatives today that they only want to supervise armaments. When Zorin talked about the Western suggestion to hand over the disarmament issue to technical experts for research, he pointed out that without the desire to conclude a disarmament agreement, no technical expert would be of any help. Zorin emphasized that the Soviet Union will, as in the past, make every effort to reach a disarmament agreement, but if the Soviet Union sees that the disarmament negotiations have no basis for reaching an agreement and will only help to deceive the people of all countries, the Soviet Union will not participate in the negotiations.

    联大政委会讨论裁军问题
    佐林谴责西方国家企图把裁军谈判引入歧途
    美代表竟把对苏进行侦察作为裁军计划前提
    据新华社22日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会19日开始讨论裁军问题。美国代表华兹沃斯在会上又一次玩弄“裁军”的空谈来掩饰美国扩军备战的真象，他的发言受到苏联代表佐林严正的谴责。
    佐林在上午会议上首先发言。他说，尽管有十国裁军委员会的沉痛经验，以及美国和它的盟国的代表在联大一般性辩论中十分不可信赖的发言，苏联仍然愿意再进行一次同西方国家就裁军问题达成协议的尝试。
    佐林接着详细地叙述了苏联裁军计划的每一阶段的内容，并且指出，为了保证在实现全面彻底裁军后由各国提供安全理事会支配的警察组成的部队能够保障各国安全，必须改变联合国秘书处和安全理事会的结构。
    佐林强调说，苏联过去和现在一直在尽一切努力，使全面彻底裁军谈判取得成功。但是，如果西方国家又要回避拟定全面彻底裁军条约，如果它们还像过去三番五次所做的那样利用裁军谈判欺骗各国人民，那么苏联代表团将不参加这种卑鄙的勾当。
    佐林指出，现在已经有迹象表明西方国家企图把谈判引向歧途。在苏联提案提出后，西方国家立即匆匆忙忙地提出了两个提案：美、英、意三国提案和英国提案。这两个提案，是要把谈判由起草全面彻底裁军条约引向对军备监督的技术细节进行无休止和无目的的争辩。西方方案所要的只是对现有军备——首先是火箭的监督措施，而根本没有谈到解散一切武装部队、取缔国家军事组织机器、停止军备生产和军事拨款、以及撤除在别国领土上的军事基地的问题。
    佐林指出，如果美国和它的盟国继续坚持它们的消极立场的话，第一委员会的工作是不可能有成效的，不言而喻，苏联将不去白白浪费时间。
    美国代表华兹沃斯在发言中力图掩饰美国十多年来一贯拖延和破坏裁军谈判的立场，空谈美国“打算……沿着真正裁军的道路走到底”。为了替美国积极扩军备战，根本不想裁军的行动辩护，华兹沃斯无耻地捏造所谓“苏联的历史”，诽谤苏联一直以优势的武装力量把
  “苏联制度强加”给他人，并且诬蔑苏联企图“利用由于不平衡的裁军计划而产生的军事优势以实现它的进一步扩张的目的”。华兹沃斯叫嚷说，美国“决不签订任何导致这种结果的协定”。
    华兹沃斯一口拒绝了苏联向政治委员会提出的裁军提案，他还歪曲事实说，苏联关于全面和彻底裁军的建议意味着所谓“不能在裁军方面采取任何行动”。
    华兹沃斯在谈到美国在裁军问题上的“基本原则和考虑”时，重申美国企图利用旷日持久的裁军谈判欺骗世界、掩饰美国大力扩军备战的政策。他强调裁军是一个“难题”，包含“种种极其复杂的问题和技术问题”，“不能靠通过决议或在掩饰基本争端的措词上取得协议来加以实现”。华兹沃斯反复强调裁军谈判“将是一个漫长和艰巨的过程”，“唯一方法是回到谈判桌旁”，进行“耐心的和可能是长时间的谈判”。华兹沃斯还扬言美国不会被苏联声明必要时将不继续参与欺骗人民的谈判的“威胁”所“吓倒”。
    华兹沃斯在会上再一次玩弄以所谓国际监督阻挠裁军的惯技。他叫嚷说，美国认为“任何切实可行的裁军计划必须”具有的一个前提是“有充分的视察和检验办法”。他从美帝国主义的侵略政策出发，大肆诬蔑社会主义国家是什么“封闭的社会”，借口“防止突袭”而要建立一个所谓“开放的世界”，以便在所谓国际视察和监督的名目下对苏联和其他社会主义国家进行间谍侦察活动。华兹沃斯叫嚷说，美国不能“废除监督或者在监督问题上走近路”。
    英国代表奥姆斯比—戈尔在发言中为英国提出的成立裁军问题专家委员会的提案辩护，英国这个提案的目的是要拖延解决裁军问题，在裁军问题上重走过去的老路。
    加拿大外交部长格林在会上发言极力为西方国家的立场辩护。
    在会上发言的巴基斯坦代表巴托支持西方国家的“裁军”提案。巴托还攻击苏联表示不参加西方国家以谈判欺骗人民的勾当的严正立场，胡说什么苏联“没有权利以接受它的要求作为参加会议的条件”。
    佐林在下午会议结束前再次发言。他强调指出，社会主义国家和西方国家在裁军方面的立场存在着深刻分歧。他说，我们主张在有效的国际监督下的全面彻底裁军。美国和它的盟国在今天它们代表的发言中再次证明，它们只是想对军备进行监督。佐林在谈到西方建议把裁军问题交给技术专家研究时指出，如果没有缔结裁军协议的愿望，那末，任何技术专家都是无济于事的。佐林强调指出，苏联仍像过去一样将对达成裁军协议作出全部的努力，但是，如果苏联看到，裁军谈判没有达成协议的基础、而只会有助于欺骗各国人民的话，苏联将不参加谈判。
