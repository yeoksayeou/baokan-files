Xinhua News Agency, October 14th, Leopoldville dispatch: Military and civilians in Leopoldville, the capital of the Congo, have expressed their support for Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and opposed the United Nations' interference in the Congo's internal affairs. On the 14th, more than 300 people held a demonstration in support of Lumumba near the "United Nations Headquarters."

The report stated that a team of police controlled by Mobutu, who launched the military coup, suppressed the demonstrators, and twelve demonstrators were injured. Since Lumumba delivered a speech to the masses in a public place on the 9th, Mobutu has sent armed military police to surround Lumumba's residence, threatening to arrest him. However, according to reports, a group of Congolese soldiers supporting Lumumba opposed this. On the 12th, they shouted in Lingala, an African language, in front of Lumumba's residence: "Why arrest Lumumba, who gave us our military ranks!" According to Agence France-Presse, these angry soldiers even went to the barracks to protest to Mobutu. At the same time, an army mobilized by Mobutu from Thysville disregarded Mobutu's orders and left the troops on the 13th.

The report stated that in the Congolese army, this dissatisfaction with Mobutu's rebellion is growing. Even Agence France-Presse had to admit on the 13th that Mobutu's "army has disintegrated so comprehensively and surprisingly that he cannot restore the prestige he once enjoyed. As M'Bolo said, what works in the Congo 'is the philosophy of Bandung, not Western logic.'"

At the same time, United Nations authorities in the Congo are plotting to deprive Lumumba of his legal rights through the Congolese parliament in order to "legitimize" Lumumba's arrest. According to United Press International, the Congolese parliament, which has been closed by Mobutu for a month, will meet next week. As early as the 11th, the United Nations authorities formally announced that Lumumba's parliamentary immunity must first be legally "revoked" before the United Nations troops "guarding" Lumumba's residence can be withdrawn and the "arrest warrant" issued by Mobutu can be executed.

It is also worth noting the conspiratorial activities of some imperialist countries' embassies in the Congo. According to reports, Bomboko, the head of the "Commissioner Committee" appointed by Mobutu, has held talks with the American, British, and French ambassadors to the Congo for days on the conspiracy to arrest Lumumba. According to the Indian Press Trust, the American ambassador did not conceal his attitude of interfering in the Congo's internal affairs and told Bomboko that he believed Mobutu's "arrest warrant" was "legal."

Xinhua News Agency, October 15th, Leopoldville dispatch: The Congolese people's patriotic struggle against imperialism and the Mobutu rebel group in Leopoldville, the capital of the Congo, has developed in recent days. On the 14th, a group of Congolese patriotic youths angrily beat Albert Ndele, the vice-chairman of the "Commissioner Committee" appointed by Mobutu, and others.

According to reports, Ndele and his assistants held a press conference at a large hotel in downtown Leopoldville that day, clamoring for an "unremitting battle" against communism and shamelessly touting Belgian-Congolese "cooperation." When he and his six assistants left the hotel, a group of Congolese youths waiting at the door could not contain their anger and immediately stepped forward to knock them down. At this moment, an American and some European colonists openly intervened to rescue the "vice-chairman." The report stated that Ndele escaped with the help of these colonists.

    刚果首都人民示威支持卢蒙巴
    联合国当局加紧策划使逮捕卢蒙巴“合法化”的阴谋
    据新华社14日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果首都利奥波德维尔军民纷纷表示支持刚果总理卢蒙巴，反对联合国对刚果内政的干涉。14日，有三百多人在“联合国总部”附近举行了支持卢蒙巴的示威。
    消息说，一队由发动军事政变的蒙博托所控制的警察对示威者进行了镇压，有十二名示威者被打伤。自9日卢蒙巴到公共场所向群众发表演说以来，蒙博托就派出武装军警包围了卢蒙巴的住所，威胁说要逮捕他。但是，据报道，有一批支持卢蒙巴的刚果士兵反对这样做，他们在12日曾以非洲林加拉语在卢蒙巴住所前高呼：“为什么要逮捕给予我们军衔的卢蒙巴！”据法新社报道，这些愤怒的士兵甚至要去军营找蒙博托抗议。同时，一支由蒙博托从太斯维尔调来的军队已不顾蒙博托的命令，在13日离开了部队。
    消息说：在刚果军队中，这种不满蒙博托叛乱行为的情绪正在增长。连法新社在13日也不得不承认：蒙博托“的军队已经如此全面和令人吃惊地瓦解了，以致他无法恢复他过去所享有的威信。正像姆博洛所说的，在刚果起作用的‘是万隆的哲学而不是西方逻辑’。”
    同时，在刚果的联合国当局正在策划通过刚果议会剥夺卢蒙巴的合法权利，以便使逮捕卢蒙巴“合法化”。据合众国际社透露，被蒙博托封闭达一月之久的刚果议会将于下星期开会。早在11日，联合国当局就曾正式宣布，要先合法地“取消”卢蒙巴的议员豁免权，联合国“守卫”卢蒙巴住所的军队才能够撤除，对蒙博托发出的“逮捕证”才能被允许执行。
    还值得注意的是一些帝国主义国家驻刚果使馆的阴谋活动。据报道，由蒙博托任命的“专员委员会”的头目邦博科，连日来同美国、英国、法国驻刚果大使就阴谋逮捕卢蒙巴一事举行了会谈。据印度报业托辣斯透露，美国大使毫不掩饰他干涉刚果内政的态度，曾对邦博科说，他认为蒙博托发出的“拘捕证”是“合法的”。
    据新华社15日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果首都利奥波德维尔人民反对帝国主义及蒙博托叛乱集团的爱国斗争连日来有所发展。14日，一群刚果爱国青年愤怒地痛打了由蒙博托任命的“专员委员会”副主席阿尔伯特·恩德勒等人。
    据报道，恩德勒和他的助手这天在利奥波德维尔市中心的一家大旅馆举行记者招待会，叫嚷要同共产主义进行“不懈的战斗”，并且无耻地鼓吹比利时—刚果“合作”。当他和他的六个助手走出旅馆时，等在门口的一群刚果青年怒不可遏立即上前把他们打倒。就在这时，一个美国人和一些欧洲殖民者竟公然出面干涉，为这个“副主席”解围。消息说，恩德勒在这些殖民者的帮助下逃跑了。
