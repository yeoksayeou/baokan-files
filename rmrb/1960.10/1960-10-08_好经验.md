Short Commentary

    To realize agricultural technical transformation, the most needed things are iron and oil. Making machines and farm tools cannot be done without iron. With tractors, water pumps, etc., there must also be various fuel oils to operate them. The rural areas of the country are so vast, and the construction of industry and other aspects require a large amount of steel and petroleum. Clearly, it is impossible to supply all or most of the steel and petroleum products needed for agricultural technical transformation by the state all at once. This has determined that our current task of technical transformation in rural areas, in addition to requiring some support from the state, should mainly take the road of self-reliance.
    The Daweijia People's Commune in Jin County, Luda City, provided a good experience of self-reliance. They, with the comprehensive utilization of coal as the center, set up a joint factory including tar, grain processing, mechanical processing and other industries, producing chemical fertilizers, pesticides, cement, pig iron, coke, diesel and other products, partially or even mostly solving the various materials needed for agricultural production and agricultural technical transformation. After the two coal dry distillation square furnaces for comprehensive utilization were put into production, within seven months, 945 tons of coke were produced, changing the past situation where iron could not be smelted due to the lack of coke when there was ore. More than 12 tons of pig iron was also produced, which was handed over to the mechanical workshop of the joint factory to make seeders, threshers and water pumps. The coal tar produced by the dry distillation square furnace was supplied to the tar processing workshop, which could refine 400 kilograms of diesel per day, fully meeting the needs of the commune's existing 28 diesel engines. The coal gas produced during the oil and coke production process can not only be used as fuel for each workshop, but also recovered some ammonium sulfate, which was applied to the fields. When the tar was refined into diesel, high-grade phenols were also extracted at the same time, and made into pesticides with high insecticidal efficacy.
    Such joint factories are worth promoting. If every people's commune with the conditions to do so set up such a factory, the speed of agricultural technical transformation would be greatly accelerated. With more new agricultural tools and agricultural machinery, and with fuel oil, the agricultural labor productivity can be greatly improved, thereby saving more labor to plant more crops and manage them more carefully.

    好经验
    实现农业技术改造，最需要的是铁和油。造机器、造农具少了铁就不行，有了拖拉机、抽水机等，还得有各种燃料油才能开动。全国农村这样广大，工业和其它各方面的建设又都需要大量的钢铁和石油。农业技术改造需要的全部或大部分钢铁和石油制品都要国家供给，显然是一下子办不到的。这样，就决定了我们当前农村的技术改造任务，除了需要国家给予部分支援外，主要应走自力更生的道路。
    旅大市金县大魏家人民公社提供了自力更生的好经验。他们以综合利用煤炭为中心，办起了一个包括焦油、粮食加工、机械加工等工业，生产化肥、农药、水泥、生铁、焦炭、柴油等多种产品的联合工厂，把农业生产和农业技术改造需要的各种物资，部分地、甚至大部分地解决了。两座综合利用煤炭的干馏方型炉投入生产后，七个月时间内，生产出了九百四十五吨焦炭，改变了过去有矿石没有焦炭不能炼铁的状况，并且生产出了十二吨多生铁，交给联合工厂的机械车间制出了播种机、脱谷机和水泵，干馏方型炉生产出的煤焦油，供给焦油加工车间，每天可以炼出四百公斤柴油，完全满足了公社现有二十八台柴油机的需要；在油、焦生产过程中同时产生的煤气，不仅可以供给每个车间作燃料用，而且回收了一些硫酸氨，施用到地里去了。在焦油提炼柴油的时候，又同时提取出了高级酚，制成了杀虫效力很高的农药。
    这样的联合工厂值得推广。如果每个有条件的人民公社都办起这样一座工厂，农业技术改造的速度就会大大加快。农村有了更多的新式农具和农业机械，有了燃料油，农业劳动生产率就可以大大提高，从而节省出更多的劳动力来，把庄稼种得更多，管得更细。
