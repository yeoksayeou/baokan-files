Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 24th -- According to a report from the Vietnam News Agency, the Liaison Delegation of the Supreme Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, in a letter to the International Commission on the 13th, revealed that in the two weeks prior to October 9th, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities established four more concentration camps in South Vietnam, hypocritically called "Agrovilles."

This brings the number of such concentration camps to as many as eighteen. According to the war preparation plans of the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem, hundreds more such concentration camps will be established in South Vietnam.

The letter stated that, like the "Agrovilles" established earlier, these areas were established after barbaric arrests, massacres, and destruction of people's property. Tens of thousands of families were forced at gunpoint to leave their homes and move to these areas.

The letter said that, contrary to Ngo Dinh Diem's deceptive propaganda, those driven there had to endure shortages of rice, clothing, and medicine, in addition to a system of massive overtime work. Earlier, a group of prominent figures in Saigon, including members of the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities, had written to Ngo Dinh Diem, warning him that if he continued to implement the policy of establishing "Agrovilles," the anger of the people in the abyss of suffering would "erupt and launch a struggle."

    吴庭艳集团又建立四个“稠密区”
    无数家庭离乡背井陷于水深火热之中
    新华社河内24日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南人民军最高司令部联络代表团13日在写给国际委员会的信中揭露，吴庭艳当局在10月9日以前的两个星期中，在越南南方又建立了四个被虚伪地称为“稠密区”的集中营。
    这一来，这类集中营的数目已达到十八个之多。根据美国和吴庭艳的备战计划，还将在越南南方建立几百个这样的集中营。
    信中说，像早些时候所建立的那些“稠密区”一样，这些地区是在野蛮的逮捕、屠杀和破坏人民财产之后建立起来的。成千上万的家庭在枪口的逼迫下，离开了自己的家乡，搬到这些地区去。
    信中说，同吴庭艳的欺骗宣传相反，除了大量超时工作的制度外，被赶到那里去的人不得不忍受大米、衣服和药品的缺乏。早些时候，西贡有一批知名人士，包括吴庭艳当局的成员曾写信给吴庭艳，警告他说，如果他继续执行建立“稠密区”的政策，在水深火热中的人民的愤怒将“爆发而展开斗争”。
