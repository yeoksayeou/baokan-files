	The Merits of the "Little Expert"
	The cabbage seedlings in our Taiping Production Team of Zhangshan Commune, which had been plagued by pests, turned green and strong on the third day after being sprayed with insecticide. People are saying that this is due to the newly arrived "little expert," Xing Wanshun.
	Xing Wanshun is an over-aged student at Taiping Elementary School in our commune. This year he is nineteen years old. He returned to the production team in response to the Party's call to strengthen the front line of agricultural production. When Xing Wanshun returned to the village, he saw a group of people gathered in the cabbage field discussing something, so he asked the commune members what was going on. When he learned that the cabbage had been affected by disease, he went home, opened his books, and found the causes and methods for preventing and controlling cabbage leaf curl. Now these diseased cabbages, after being sprayed with wettable "666" powder, are growing vigorously again.

    “小专家”的功劳
    我们张山公社太平生产队受虫害的白菜苗，在喷药后的第三天，就变青发壮了。人们都说，这是新来的“小专家”邢万顺的功劳。
    邢万顺是我们公社太平小学的超龄学生，今年十九岁，他是响应党提出加强农业生产第一线的号召后回到生产队来的。邢万顺回村时，看见一群人围在白菜地里议论着什么，于是就向社员打听怎么回事。当他知道是白菜受了病害以后，回家就翻开了书本，找到了防治菜叶卷曲病的原因和方法。现在这些受病的白菜用可湿性“六六六”药粉喷治后，又旺盛地生长起来了。
