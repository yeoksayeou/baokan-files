    Ant Island Folk Songs
    An old grandpa, a new sister-in-law, enthusiastically support the commune, quickly searching through cabinets and chests, competing to hand over tin bottles and candlesticks, sweeping the corners of the bed and walls, even old steel and scrap iron are needed. Decorate the fishing boats like wedding sedan chairs, sailing smoothly with the wind, full of the sea.
    
    Not buying woolen yarn, not buying broadcloth, not cooking meals, not giving gifts; patching old clothes, turning old clothes into new, using scraps to make shoe soles. Support production and great development, equipping each fishing boat with machines.
    
    Little Ant Island has great aspirations, commune members stir up the sea, casting large nets to suppress the waves, production enthusiasm surpasses the storm, boats full of songs, boats full of laughter, nets bring in gold and silver, moving them onto the island.

    蚂蚁岛民谣
    一老爷爷，新阿嫂，支援公社热情高，橱里柜中快快找，锡瓶烛台争着缴，床头壁角扫一扫，旧钢烂铁也需要。装扮渔船像花轿，顺风顺水满海跑。
    二不买绒线不买呢，不作羹饭不送礼；破衣补破被，旧衣翻新衣，零头角面做鞋底。支援生产大发展，每只渔船装机器。
    三小小蚂蚁志气高，公社社员把海闹，撒下大网压波涛，生产劲头盖风暴，满船歌，满船笑，网来金银搬上岛。
