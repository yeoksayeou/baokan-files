On the occasion of commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Hall of the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, with its large collection of cultural relics, tells the heroic deeds of the Volunteers to millions of viewers, and tells of the friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, forged with blood, a friendship higher than the mountains and deeper than the sea.

Among the cultural relics on display in the hall, there is a bed sheet with thirty-eight bullet holes. Crowds of viewers gathered in front of it. A team of young People's Liberation Army soldiers was listening to a former volunteer telling the story of this bed sheet. He said: "This is a souvenir given to the Volunteers by 'Volunteer Army Mother' - Korean mother Ham Jae-bok when the Volunteers returned home. This Korean mother rescued wounded Volunteers during the Battle of Shangganling at the risk of fierce artillery fire, and broke through ice holes in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius to wash bloody clothes for wounded Volunteers. Therefore, the Volunteer soldiers called this Korean mother 'Volunteer Army Mother'..." Li Baocheng, the commander of the "Steel Eighth Company," who commanded a heroic company in the Battle of Shangganling and held on to the Shangganling tunnels for fourteen days and nights, explained this story to the PLA soldiers. He pointed to a photo on display in the hall and said to the soldiers, "This is a photo taken when Mother Ham Jae-bok presented this bed sheet to the Volunteer Army troops guarding Shangganling when they returned home in 1958." He said that when Mother Ham Jae-bok rescued wounded Volunteers, one Volunteer soldier sacrificed by her side, and that soldier left this bed sheet, covered with blood. Mother Ham Jae-bok washed off the blood on it and preserved it for more than five years. When the Volunteer Army troops guarding Shangganling returned home, she saw them off again and again. At the time of parting, Mother Ham Jae-bok, with tears in her eyes, took out this bed sheet. She said that she kept this bed sheet as a souvenir. When she looked at the bullet holes on it, she felt anger towards the American aggressors; when she looked at the remaining blood stains on it, she thought of the sons and daughters of China. Now that the Volunteers have returned home, this souvenir should be given to the mothers of China, so that the mothers of China, after seeing it, will be proud of having given birth to such heroic sons and daughters. At that time, all the Volunteer soldiers were moved to tears. They surrounded this Korean mother and said, "Mother, your Chinese sons and daughters will never forget you even after returning home. The hard work you have put in for the Volunteer soldiers, the efforts you have made for your Chinese sons and daughters, will always remain in our hearts." The eyes of the PLA soldiers who heard the story of this bed sheet were all moist. The young soldiers said, "The 'Volunteer Army Mother' of Korea is also our mother. We can never forget the deep friendship of the Korean people towards the Chinese people and army."

The War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Hall displays a farewell letter from the Chinese People's Volunteers to the Korean fathers and elders, brothers and sisters, and aunts when they withdrew from Korea in 1958. The letter said when talking about the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, that this kind of friendship: "Rivers and streams should sing praises, and even wood and stone should be moved." A large number of cultural relics on display in the hall tell the audience about this kind of friendship. Here, a piece of broken tile, a water jar, or a broken pot all contain a touching story. In a glass case, there is displayed an axe and three pieces of water tank tile. Its origin is like this: In Gangdong County, Korea, there was an old lady named Li Shaotan. One day, the Volunteers marched past this place and asked the old lady for lodging. The old lady's house was very small, and there was a large tank on the floor. In order to let the Volunteer soldiers sleep on the warm floor, the old lady wanted to move the tank out, but the tank was too big and the door was too small to move it out. The old lady simply picked up an axe and smashed the ancestral tank that had been passed down for generations. Another Korean mother, Liu Mei, would quietly take off the shoes and socks of the Volunteer soldiers who had been arranged to sleep soundly in her home after they had trudged through the mud, wash them and dry them. In the winter of Korea, the wind is cold and the nights are cold. Mother Liu Mei covered the wounded Volunteer soldiers with the only quilt in the family. She was still afraid that the wounded soldiers would get cold, so she took off her cotton coat and covered the wounded soldiers' feet. Her family ate chaff and vegetables, but saved the rice to cook porridge or make rice for the wounded Volunteer soldiers. When the wounded soldiers could not eat by themselves, she held the bowl and fed them spoonful by spoonful to the wounded Volunteer soldiers; when the wounded soldiers could not get up to relieve themselves, she held the basin and jar to collect their stool and urine. Many wounded Volunteer soldiers resolutely stated after they recovered and returned to the front line to kill the enemy: The Korean mother gave me a second life, and my second life should also be dedicated to the Korean mother. Many former Volunteer personnel came to the Military Museum today, lingered and pondered in front of these cultural relics, recalled the love of the Korean fathers and elders, brothers and sisters, and silently recited the names of the Korean mothers, recalled the moments when they charged into battle to avenge the Korean mothers and children who were brutally murdered...

The pictures, oil paintings, and objects on display in the hall depict the scene of the Korean battlefield: in front are the heroic Korean People's Army and Volunteers fighting, and behind are the transportation teams, stretcher teams, tea stations, and mobilization stations composed of the Korean people, which lead directly from every village and road in Korea to every position on the front line. On the mountain peaks where the rocks were blasted into stone powder, and in places where the trees were uprooted, the Korean people, for the victory of the armies of China and Korea, braved bombing, artillery fire, and bullets to transport grain, deliver ammunition, and build roads for the troops. Here is displayed a road sign for Section 317. This section of the highway leads to Shangganling, and it is less than five kilometers long. However, the enemy dropped three thousand bombs on the road surface here, but did not blow it up. In those years, the artists in the Volunteer Army also painted such an oil painting: Korean grandfathers, Korean women with soil baskets on their heads, stubbornly build roads despite the bombing and strafing of enemy planes. If the enemy bombs a pit, they fill a pit; if the enemy destroys a bridge, they repair a bridge, ensuring that vehicles loaded with grain and ammunition speed along the steel transportation line. The Korean people not only stuffed steamed rice cakes and winter-stored apples into the pockets of the Volunteer soldiers passing by, but also sent grain and rice to the positions of the Volunteer Army. Here is a painting depicting the heroic support of the Korean people in the Battle of Feihushan: Grandfathers and grandmothers, leaning on crutches and carrying grain on their backs, women with wooden basins and earthen pots full of rice on their heads, climb over mountains and ridges and pass through enemy blockades to deliver to the front line positions. Here is also displayed a pair of carrying poles used by Korean old man Jin Chandao to deliver grain to Feihushan in those years. The old man sacrificed on the way to deliver grain, and his son carried this pair of carrying poles to deliver the grain to the Volunteer soldiers who had been fighting continuously for five days and nights.

The deeds of the heroic Korean people supporting the Volunteer Army's operations with blood and life have become rich teaching materials for the Chinese people to conduct internationalist education. Many viewers stopped in front of a hat and a pipe left by a Korean farmer. The narrator told the audience: This is the belongings of Shen Yongchun, the famous guide of the Volunteer Army troops - the old Korean man. From the day the Volunteer Army crossed the Yalu River, he led the Volunteers more than a hundred times without complaint. Once, a napalm bomb dropped by an enemy plane set his clothes on fire, he put out the fire and continued to lead the troops forward. Here is also displayed a shovel used by the Korean girl Shi Jirong to dig wild vegetables for the Volunteer Army. This girl had one leg blown off while digging wild vegetables. Three days after she was discharged from the hospital, she went to the tea station to serve with crutches. Hu Xiudao, a former Volunteer Army first-class combat hero who was awarded the title of Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, stood for a long time in front of the shovel used by the girl Shi Jirong when he visited the museum. He said: "On the eve of the Battle of Shangganling, I saw the girl Shi Jirong at the tea station. She came to me with one hand holding a crutch and the other hand holding tea, and asked me to drink that cup of hot tea before going to the battlefield."

Many former Volunteer Army officers and soldiers, when visiting the museum, talked about the infinite love of the Korean people for the Volunteer Army. Someone talked about An Ok-hee, a heroic Korean woman who took her seven-year-old child, went deep into the tiger's den, rescued captured Volunteer soldiers from the enemy's prison, blew up five American devils with a hand grenade, and died together with the enemy; someone talked about Park Jae-geun, a Korean People's Hero who gloriously sacrificed his life by shielding wounded Volunteer soldiers during the Battle of Shangganling; someone talked about Fang Xingyu, a heroic Korean father who gritted his teeth and endured the pain and took up his son's stretcher to safely send the wounded to the rear after his son sacrificed his life to rescue wounded Volunteer soldiers; and someone talked about Gu Fuli, a heroic Korean wife who buried her husband's body and carried the stretcher that her husband had been carrying to the front line. Many former Volunteer personnel who came to visit said that the flower of Sino-Korean friendship is irrigated with blood, and we must cherish it forever.

    中朝友谊万年长
    新华社记者  周长宗  王毓琛  宁焕明
    在纪念志愿军抗美援朝出国作战十周年之际，中国人民革命军事博物馆抗美援朝战争馆以它大量的文物展品，向千万观众讲述着志愿军的丰功伟绩，讲述着山也不能比其高、海也不能比其深的中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的友谊。
    馆内陈列的文物展品中，有一条上面有三十八个弹孔的被单。在它前边，聚集了成群的观众。一队年青的解放军战士，正在听一位前志愿军人员讲述这条被单的来历。他说：“这是‘志愿军妈妈’——朝鲜母亲咸在福在志愿军归国时，送给志愿军的纪念品。这位朝鲜母亲，在上甘岭战斗中，冒着猛烈的炮火救护志愿军伤员，并冒着零下三十度严寒天气，砸开冰窟窿为志愿军伤员洗血衣。因此，志愿军战士都称这位朝鲜母亲为‘志愿军妈妈’……。”向解放军战士们讲解这段故事的是在上甘岭战斗中指挥一个英雄连队，在上甘岭坑道里坚守了十四昼夜的“钢铁八连”的连长李保成。他指着馆里陈列的一张照片，对战士们说：“这是咸在福妈妈当守卫上甘岭的志愿军部队于1958年归国时，向志愿军赠送这条被单时拍下的照片。”他说，咸在福妈妈抢救志愿军伤员时，有一位志愿军的战士牺牲在她身边，那战士留下了这条被单，上边沾满了血迹。咸在福妈妈洗去了上边的血，把它保存了五年多。守卫上甘岭的志愿军部队归国时，她送了一程又一程，在分别的时候，咸在福妈妈流着热泪，拿出了这条被单，她说，她保留这条被单，本来是为了作为纪念品，她看看上边的弹孔，就燃起对美国侵略者的愤怒；看看上边残留的血迹，就想起中国的儿女。现在志愿军归国了，这件纪念品应当送给中国的母亲，让中国的母亲看了它，为自己生育了这样的英雄儿女而感到骄傲。当时，志愿军战士们个个感动得流下眼泪，他们围着这位朝鲜母亲说：“妈妈，你的中国的儿女，回国后也永远不会忘记你。你对志愿军战士付出的辛苦劳累，你为你的中国儿女耗费的心血，将永远留在我们的心上。”听了这条被单来历的解放军战士们，眼睛里都润湿了。年青的战士们说：“朝鲜的‘志愿军妈妈’，也是我们的妈妈。我们永远不能忘记朝鲜人民对中国人民和军队的深情厚谊。”
    抗美援朝战争馆中，陈列着中国人民志愿军1958年撤离朝鲜时向朝鲜父老兄弟、诸姑姐妹的告别信。这封信上谈到中朝人民的友谊时说，这种友谊：“河川也要歌颂，木石也要动心”。馆中的大量文物展品，都向观众讲述了这种友谊。这里陈列的一片碎瓦、一个水罐或一口破锅，都包含着一段动人的故事。在一个玻璃匣中，陈列着一把斧头，和三块水缸瓦片，它的来历是这样的：在朝鲜江东郡有位李少潭老妈妈，有一天，志愿军行军从这路过，向老妈妈借宿，老妈妈的屋子很小，地炕上还放了一口大缸。老妈妈为了让志愿军战士睡在热炕上，要把缸搬出去，可是缸大门小搬不出，老妈妈索性拿起一把斧头，把那口祖传几代的大缸砸碎了。另一位朝鲜妈妈柳梅，每当她把接到家里的志愿军战士安排睡熟了以后，她便悄悄把战士们跋涉泥泞湿透的鞋袜脱下来，洗净再烤干。朝鲜的冬季，风寒夜冷。柳梅妈妈将全家仅有的一床棉被，盖到志愿军伤员身上，她还唯恐伤员受寒，再把自己穿的棉袄脱下，盖在伤员的脚头。她一家人吃糠咽菜，却把大米省下来给志愿军伤员熬粥或作饭。伤员不能自己吃饭，她端着碗一勺勺地送到志愿军战士的嘴边；伤员不能起身解大小便，她便端着盆罐给接屎接尿。多少志愿军伤员痊愈后，重赴前线杀敌的时候都坚决表示：朝鲜母亲给了我第二次生命，我的这二次生命也要献给朝鲜母亲。许多前志愿军人员今天来到军事博物馆，在这些文物展品之前逗留深思，回忆着朝鲜父老兄弟诸姑姊妹的热爱默念着朝鲜妈妈的名字，回忆着为惨遭杀害的朝鲜母亲和儿童复仇而冲锋陷阵的时刻……。
    馆里陈列的图片、油画和实物，这样描绘了朝鲜战场的图景：前面是英勇作战的朝鲜人民军和志愿军，后边是朝鲜人民组成的运输队、担架队、茶水站和鼓动站，它们从朝鲜的每个村庄、每条道路，直通向前沿每个阵地。在岩石被炸成石粉的山头，在树木被连根拔起的地方，朝鲜人民为了朝中两国军队战斗的胜利，冒着轰炸、炮火和枪弹，为部队运粮、送弹和筑路。这里陈列着三一七地段的路标。这段公路通往上甘岭，它一共不到五公里长。可是敌人在这里的路面上投下了三千颗炸弹，而没有把它炸断。当年志愿军中的美术家还画了这样一幅油画：朝鲜的老爷爷们，头上顶着土筐的朝鲜妇女们，不顾敌机的轰炸扫射，在顽强地筑路。敌机炸一个坑，他们就补一个坑；敌人毁一座桥，他们就修一座桥，保证满载着粮食和弹药的车辆，在钢铁运输线上飞驰。朝鲜人民不仅把蒸好的米糕和冬藏的苹果塞到过路的志愿军战士的口袋里，还把粮米送到志愿军的阵地上。这里有一幅描画飞虎山战斗中，朝鲜人民英勇支前的油画：老爷爷和老妈妈们拄着拐杖、背着粮食，妇女们头上顶着装满米饭的木盆、瓦罐，爬山越岭，穿过敌人的封锁线，送往前沿阵地。这里还陈列着朝鲜金灿道老大爷当年往飞虎山送粮用的一付背架。老大爷在送粮途中牺牲了，他的儿子背起这付背架，将粮米送到连续进行了五昼夜战斗的志愿军战士手里。
    英雄的朝鲜人民用鲜血和生命支援志愿军作战的事迹，已成为中国人民进行国际主义教育的丰富教材。许多观众在一个朝鲜农民遗留的一顶帽子和一枝烟袋前边站住了。解说员向观众说：这是有名的志愿军部队的向导——朝鲜老大爷申永淳生前的用物。从志愿军跨过鸭绿江那天起，他不辞劳苦地为志愿军带路一百多次。有一次，敌机投下的燃烧弹烧着了他的衣服，他扑灭了火，继续带领部队前进。在这里，还陈列着朝鲜姑娘石吉荣给志愿军挖野菜用的铁铲。这个姑娘在挖野菜时，被炸断了一条腿，她出院后三天，就用手拄着拐杖，到茶水站服务。荣膺朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄称号的前志愿军一级战斗英雄胡修道来馆内参观时，在石吉荣姑娘用的铁铲前站了很久。他说：“在上甘岭战役前夜，我在茶水站看到了石吉荣姑娘。她一手拄着拐杖，一手端着茶水，来到我跟前，让我在上战场之前，喝下那杯热茶。”
    许多前志愿军官兵来馆内参观时，见物生情地谈到了朝鲜人民对志愿军的无限热爱。有人谈到带着七岁孩子、深入虎口，从敌人囚牢中救出被俘的志愿军战士，用手榴弹炸死五个美国鬼子，与敌人同归于尽的朝鲜英雄妇女安玉姬；有人谈到在上甘岭战斗中，用身体掩护志愿军伤员，光荣牺牲的朝鲜人民英雄朴在根；有人谈到当儿子抢救志愿军伤员牺牲后，自己咬牙忍疼、担起儿子的担架，把伤员安全送往后方的朝鲜英雄父亲方兴祐；还有人谈到埋掉丈夫的尸体，抬起丈夫抬的担架奔往火线的朝鲜英雄妻子具富力。许多前来参观的前志愿军人员都说，中朝友谊之花，是用鲜血灌溉起来的，我们永远要珍贵它。
