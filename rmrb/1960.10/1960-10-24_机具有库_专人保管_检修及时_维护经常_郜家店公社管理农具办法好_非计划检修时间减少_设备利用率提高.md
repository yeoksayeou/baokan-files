(From our correspondent in Shenyang, October 23rd) The Gaojiadian Commune in Xifeng County, Shenyang City, has vigorously strengthened the maintenance and management of machinery and equipment, achieving the goals of having warehouses for machines and tools, dedicated personnel for management, timely repairs, and frequent maintenance, effectively improving the utilization rate of machinery and equipment.

Over the past two years, the Gaojiadian Commune has launched a mass tool reform movement centered on achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization, resulting in a significant increase in machinery and equipment. The commune now possesses 1,025 pieces of various agricultural implements, 60 power equipment units, and more than 80 sets of farmland irrigation and drainage equipment, representing an increase of between 50% and 100% compared to last year. Since the beginning of this year, the commune has successively adopted several measures to maintain machinery and equipment. In July, a mass movement focused on establishing machine warehouses for maintenance was launched. Since then, the phenomenon of lost equipment parts and unscheduled repair time has been significantly reduced, and the utilization rate of machinery and equipment has been greatly improved. For example, the utilization rate of the main power equipment, diesel engines, averaged only 40%-50% before July, but increased to over 70% in August. The utilization rates of grain processing, feed crushing, and other machines have also significantly increased. In the past, a large amount of manpower had to be concentrated on repairing and rushing to make farm tools before the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing). This year, due to the good preservation of the "Three Autumns" tools, the number of people engaged in repairing and rushing to make old tools has been greatly reduced compared to previous years, and more manpower has been invested in the work of modifying new types of farm tools. Recently, more than a dozen new types of "Three Autumns" tools have been successfully reformed.

The improvement in the utilization rate of machinery and equipment and the continuous modification of a large number of new-style machines and tools have powerfully promoted the level of agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization. Before July, the majority of grain processing and feed crushing in the commune was done by manual labor, but now it has basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the "Three Autumns" production has also been greatly improved due to the modification of a large number of mechanically powered tools.

The Gaojiadian Commune has tightly grasped the three key links of warehouse management, repair and maintenance, and technological improvement in strengthening the maintenance and management of machinery and equipment.

Establishing machine warehouses so that all machinery and equipment can be sheltered from wind and rain is the primary link in maintaining machinery and equipment. Since July this year, the commune's fourteen brigades and more than ninety teams have universally built simple machine warehouses, established various management systems, and achieved "iron machines don't rust, wooden machines don't have loose rivets, use must be registered, and return to the machine warehouse after use."

After establishing machine warehouses, the production teams have further strengthened the maintenance and repair of machinery and equipment. In order to ensure the safe operation of various machines and reduce non-production time, in addition to designating the commune's machinery factory, carpentry factory, and farm implement repair factory as the commune's machinery and equipment repair bases, these three factories and the commune's mechanical and electrical management station have also assigned full-time personnel to form mobile repair teams, which regularly go to various brigades and teams to repair machinery and equipment. They have also established and improved the maintenance system for key machinery and equipment and strengthened daily maintenance work. This has gradually reduced the occurrence of machinery damage and increased the normal operating time. For example, the two diesel engines in the Pingyuan Production Brigade and the grain, feed, and other processing machinery driven by them have been operating normally in the past two months after establishing and improving the maintenance and repair system.

The commune party committee has also strengthened the technical education of workers in all aspects to improve their operating skills and avoid damaging machinery. This year, more than fifty people in the commune have undergone short-term rotational training, and more than twenty new technicians have been trained at the same time. When new machinery begins to be used, skilled craftsmen are dispatched from the commune's machinery, carpentry, and farm implement repair factories to go deep into the fields to spread usage techniques and help commune members become familiar with operating techniques. The phenomenon of damaged machinery has therefore been significantly reduced.

Because the commune party committee has always adhered to the principle of putting politics in command and the method of launching mass movements in strengthening the maintenance and management of machinery and equipment, the vast number of cadres, commune members, and machine operators are highly motivated to maintain and manage machinery and equipment. In a short period of time, more than one hundred machine warehouses have been built throughout the commune, and various machines and tools scattered in the open air have been concentrated in the machine warehouses. The Yongfeng Production Brigade not only ensures that all machines and tools, large and small, are put into the warehouse after use, but also, on rainy days, commune members often proactively cover the machines and tools with grass bags to protect them from the rain.

In order to maintain and manage machinery and equipment well, the Gaojiadian Commune has also taken some measures in terms of organizational leadership. In addition to having a leading cadre in charge of machinery management in both the commune and the brigade, the commune has also established a mechanical and electrical management station to uniformly manage and repair machinery and equipment; at the same time, the commune's farm implement repair factory, carpentry factory, and machinery factory are designated as bases for agricultural machinery repair; large brigades have also established machine repair points, specializing in machinery maintenance. The commune has now achieved the ability to carry out medium repairs within the commune, small repairs within the team, and can also partially carry out major repairs.

    非计划检修时间减少  设备利用率提高
    本报沈阳23日电　沈阳市西丰县郜家店公社大力加强机具设备维护管理工作，做到了机具有库、专人保管、检修及时、维护经常，有效提高了机具设备的利用率。
    郜家店公社最近两年来开展了以实现机械化和半机械化为中心的群众性工具改革运动，机具设备大量增加。全社现在拥有各种农业机具一千零二十五件，动力设备六十台，农田排灌设备八十多套，分别比去年增加了半倍到一倍以上。这个公社从今年年初以来，就陆续采取了若干维护机具设备的措施。7月份又开展了以建立机仓为中心的维护机具设备的群众运动。从此以后，丢失设备部件的现象和非计划检修时间显著减少，机具设备利用程度大大提高。例如：主要动力设备柴油机7月份以前的利用率平均只达到40％—50％，8月份已提高到70％以上；粮谷加工、饲料粉碎等机器的利用率，也都有显著提高。过去“三秋”前常常要集中很多人力检修和赶制农具，今年由于“三秋”工具保管的好，从事检修和赶制旧工具的人比往年大为减少，有更多的人力投入了改制新式农具的工作。最近就改革成功了十几种新式“三秋”工具。
    机具设备利用程度的提高和大批新式机具的不断改制出来，有力地促进了农业机械化和半机械化程度的提高。7月份以前，全社粮谷加工、饲料粉碎，大部分是手工劳动，现在已基本上实现了机械化和半机械化；“三秋”生产的机械化和半机械化程度，也因改制成大批用机械作动力的机具而大大提高。
    郜家店公社在加强机具设备维护管理工作中，紧紧抓住了建仓保管、检修维护、提高技术这三个环节。
    建立机仓，让所有的机具设备都能遮风雨，这是维护机具设备的首要环节。从今年7月份开始，全社十四个大队和九十多个小队普遍修建了简易机具仓房，建立了各种管理制度，实现了“铁机不生锈、木机不烂铆、使用要登记、用后归机仓”。
    各生产队在建立机库后，进一步加强了机具设备维护检修工作。为了使各种机具安全运转，减少非生产时间，除确定公社机械厂、木器厂、农具修配厂作为全社机具检修基地外，还由这三个厂和公社机电管理站抽出专人，组成流动检修队，经常到各大队和小队检修机具设备。他们还建立和健全了重点机具设备维护保养制度，加强了日常的保养工作。这样就使机具损坏现象逐渐减少，增加了正常运转的时间。如平原生产大队两台柴油机和由它们带动的粮谷、饲料等加工机具，经过建立和健全维护检修制度后，最近两个月来运转一直正常。
    公社党委还从各方面加强职工的技术教育，提高他们的操作技术水平，以免损坏机具。今年，全社已有五十多人经过短期轮训，同时新培养了二十多名技工。一些新机具开始使用时，都由公社机械、木器、农具修配三个厂派出能工巧匠，深入田间传播使用技术，帮助社员熟悉操作技术。损坏机具的现象因而显著减少。
    由于公社党委在加强机具设备维护管理工作中，始终坚持了政治挂帅的原则和大搞群众运动的方法，广大干部、社员和机械手维护管理机具设备的积极性很高。全社在短期内，就修建了一百多座机库，并把分散在露天地的各种机具集中到机仓里去。永丰生产大队不但做到了大小机具用完就入库，社员们在雨天还经常主动把机具用草袋子苫上，使机具不受雨淋。
    郜家店公社为了维护管理好机具设备，在组织领导方面也采取了一些措施。除了公社和大队都有一名领导干部负责机具管理工作以外，公社还设立了机电管理站，统一负责机具设备的管理和维修工作；同时确定公社农具修配厂、木器厂和机械厂作为农业机械检修的基地；各大队也建立了机修点，专门负责机具维修工作。全社目前已做到中修不出社，小修不出队，同时能部分进行大修。
