Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. "The most wonderful thing in the world is to be able to see the strength that serves justice and peace." After visiting the Chinese People's Revolution Military Museum today, Ferhat Abbas, Premier of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, wrote these enthusiastic words in the museum's guestbook.

　　This afternoon, Premier Abbas and other distinguished guests of the Provisional Government Delegation of the Republic of Algeria, accompanied by Vice Premier of the State Council Marshal Nie Rongzhen and Director of the West Asia and Africa Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs He Ying, arrived by car at the Chinese People's Revolution Military Museum, surrounded by green trees, and were warmly welcomed by General Yang Yong of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Major General Jia Ruoyu, the museum's curator.

　　Premier Abbas and other distinguished guests, accompanied by Marshal Nie Rongzhen and others, then visited the Comprehensive Hall, the Weapons Hall, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Hall in the museum. In front of two huge maps, the distinguished guests listened to detailed introductions of the Long March of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and the consolidation and development of the anti-Japanese base areas. The Weapons Hall displayed various American-made weapons, such as airplanes, artillery, and tanks, captured on the battlefield. When the distinguished guests arrived at this hall, Marshal Nie Rongzhen said to Premier Abbas with humor: "The imperialists used these weapons to fight us, but as you can see, the result is that it has become our arsenal!" Premier Abbas and others laughed happily after hearing this.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Premier Abbas and all the distinguished guests of the Provisional Government Delegation of the Republic of Algeria, accompanied by Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun and Vice Mayor of Beijing Wu Han, visited the Great Wall at Badaling and the Ming Tombs this morning.

　　The distinguished guests first went to Badaling, climbed the towering city wall, and viewed the scenery inside and outside the Great Wall. The weather was clear today, and the winding city walls and undulating mountains were bathed in the autumn sun, appearing particularly magnificent and beautiful. The distinguished guests lingered here, constantly praising the greatness of the project and the beauty of the scenery. They talked about the ancient wars of China and then about the guerrilla warfare in Algeria today. Premier Abbas pointed to a continuous range of mountains outside the city wall, and the newly planted trees on the mountains, and said with great interest: "This is a very good place for Algerian guerrillas." He asked Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun whether there used to be forests on these mountains. When Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun told him that there used to be many trees here, but they were all burned down by the Japanese invading army during the War of Resistance Against Japan in order to prevent the activities of the people's guerrillas, Premier Abbas continued, saying that the French colonialists were afraid of the Algerian guerrillas, and they were also desperately destroying the forests, but Algeria had many forests, and the French colonialists could not destroy them all.

　　At the Dingling Tomb Museum of the Ming Tombs, the distinguished guests visited the underground palace's architecture and cultural relics. Zhu Xintao, the person in charge of the museum, introduced the construction history and excavation of this underground palace to the distinguished guests and answered some of the questions raised by them. After lunch, the distinguished guests visited the Ming Tombs Reservoir. On the dam of the reservoir, the distinguished guests viewed the scenery of the reservoir and listened to the introduction of the reservoir project by Ling Yuqing, the person in charge of the reservoir. After the visit, Ling Yuqing presented several albums of the reservoir to the distinguished guests as souvenirs.

　　The distinguished guests were very satisfied with this visit, and Premier Abbas said to Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun: "Today was a very meaningful trip."

    今天下午，阿巴斯总理和阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团的其他贵宾，在国务院副总理聂荣臻元帅、外交部西亚非洲司司长何英陪同下，乘车来到绿树丛中的中国人民革命军事博物馆的时候，受到中国人民解放军杨勇上将和博物馆馆长贾若谕少将的热烈欢迎。
    阿巴斯总理等贵宾接着由聂荣臻元帅等人陪同，参观了博物馆中的综合馆、兵器馆和抗美援朝战争馆。在两幅巨大的地图前面，贵宾们听取了中国工农红军长征经过和抗日根据地巩固发展情况的详细介绍。兵器馆里陈列着许多在战场上缴获的美国制造的飞机、大炮、坦克等各种武器，贵宾们来到这个馆后，聂荣臻元帅很有风趣地向阿巴斯总理说：“帝国主义拿这些武器打我们，你看结果它变成我们的兵工厂了！”阿巴斯总理等听后都欢乐地笑了。
    新华社4日讯　阿巴斯总理和阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团全体贵宾，今天上午由习仲勋副总理和北京市副市长吴晗等陪同，参观游览了八达岭和十三陵。
