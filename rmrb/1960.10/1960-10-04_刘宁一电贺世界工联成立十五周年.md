Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, today sent a telegram to Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, congratulating the 15th anniversary of the founding of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
    Liu Ningyi's congratulatory telegram said: "On the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the founding of the World Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of the Chinese workers, I would like to extend the workers' warm and fraternal congratulations to the World Federation of Trade Unions and to you personally.
    "Fifteen years ago, the establishment of the World Federation of Trade Unions had great significance in the history of the international trade union movement. On the basis of the victory of the anti-fascist war, it united the vast majority of workers and trade unions around the world, defeated the sabotage and divisive conspiracies of imperialism and its running dogs, and achieved the broadest unity of international workers in history. The World Federation of Trade Unions has always adhered to the banner of international workers' progress and unity, and has won increasingly widespread support from workers in various countries.
    "Currently, the international workers' movement is facing an excellent situation. The struggles of the working classes in various countries have made great progress, the level of workers' consciousness, organization, and combat effectiveness have been unprecedentedly improved, and the unity of the working class has also been greatly strengthened.
    "Not long ago, the 11th session of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions, held in Beijing, seriously discussed the situation and tasks facing the international working class, and once again clearly pointed out that US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of peace and the peoples of all countries, calling on workers in all countries to remain vigilant at all times and strengthen the struggle against imperialism and for the defense of world peace. This meeting has played a major role in strengthening the international solidarity of the working class and further mobilizing workers in various countries to persist in the victorious struggle.
    "Chinese workers and Chinese trade unions have always actively participated in and supported the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, have always been concerned about and dedicated to the cause of international working-class unity, and have always stood at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and for the defense of world peace.
    "On the occasion of commemorating the 15th anniversary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, I wish the World Federation of Trade Unions greater achievements in the struggle against imperialism, for the defense of peace, for national independence, democratic freedom, and for the protection of the vital interests of workers."

    刘宁一电贺世界工联成立十五周年
    新华社3日讯　中华全国总工会主席刘宁一今天打电报给世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬，祝贺世界工联成立十五周年。
    刘宁一的贺电说：“欣逢世界工会联合会成立十五周年之际，谨代表中国工人向世界工联以及您本人致以工人阶级的、热烈的、兄弟般的祝贺。
    “十五年前，世界工联的成立在国际工会运动史上有着重大的意义，它在反法西斯战争的胜利的基础上，团结了全世界绝大多数工人群众和工会，击败了帝国主义及其走狗的破坏和分裂阴谋，实现了历史上最广泛的国际工人的统一团结。世界工联一直坚持国际工人进步和团结的旗帜，获得了各国工人群众日益广泛的支持。
    “目前国际工人运动正面临着一片大好形势。各国工人阶级的斗争取得了巨大的进展，工人觉悟的水平、组织性和战斗性空前提高，工人阶级的团结也有了极大的加强。
    “不久前，在北京举行的世界工联第十一届理事会会议认真地讨论了国际工人阶级面临的形势和任务，再一次明确指出美帝国主义是和平和各国人民的最凶恶的敌人，号召各国工人时刻保持警惕，加强反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的斗争。这次会议对于加强工人阶级的国际团结，进一步动员各国工人坚持胜利的斗争有着重大的作用。
    “中国工人和中国工会一贯积极参加和支持世界工联的活动，一贯关心和致力于国际工人阶级团结的事业，一贯站在反对以美国为首的帝国主义、保卫世界和平斗争的最前列。
    “在纪念世界工联十五周年的时候，谨祝世界工联在反对帝国主义、保卫和平、争取民族独立、民主自由、保卫工人切身利益的斗争中获得更大的成就。”
