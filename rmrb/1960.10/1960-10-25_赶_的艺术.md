    The Art of "Rushing"
    Yu Yang
    There are only two months and a few days left, and the first year of the 1960s will be over. The situation on the production and construction front this year is very good. The current task is to seize these last two months to strive to complete the national plan ahead of schedule and exceed the quota, and to prepare for continued leaps forward next year.
    How to achieve this task? The method is one word: "rush." Everything must be rushed forward, and every task must be completed ahead of schedule. Among these two months, the last few days of October and November are particularly important. By seizing these thirty-odd days to complete more tasks, December will be in a very active position, allowing us to strive to exceed the planned tasks even more and have more time to prepare for next year's production.
    There is an art to rushing. The Xuzhou Dongzhuang Coal Mine's campaign to complete the national plan ahead of schedule has "rushed" very effectively. In terms of time, their goal is to complete a shift's task two hours ahead of schedule; a day's task three hours ahead of schedule; a ten-day task one day ahead of schedule; and a month's task three days ahead of schedule. This kind of layer-by-layer competition provides a reliable guarantee for completing the annual plan ahead of schedule, and it can be done calmly.
    The various links in production are interconnected. If the previous process rushes ahead, but the next process cannot keep up, it will be difficult for the previous process to continue to advance. Therefore, it is also necessary to advance both before and after, and left and right. Only in this way will there be mutual promotion instead of mutual restraint. The Dongzhuang Coal Mine's "advance" competition, with shifts guaranteeing each other, coal mining ahead of the plan, tunneling ahead of coal extraction, and department management and other work closely following production, etc., weaves the entire production into a dynamic picture of crisscrossing, coordinated links, constantly increasing coal production. This is an art, the art of seizing October and November and striving to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule, the art of organizing sustained leaps forward in production and construction. Every enterprise should learn this art of "rushing" and make full use of the last two months of this year.

    “赶”的艺术
    于羊
    还有两个月零几天，六十年代的第一年就要过去了。今年生产建设战线的形势很好。当前的任务是要抓紧最后这两个多月，力争提前和超额完成今年的国家计划，为明年继续跃进做好准备。
    怎样实现这个任务呢？办法是一个“赶”字。要事事往前赶，件件工作提前。这两个多月当中，10月最后几天和11月份又至关紧要。抓紧这三十多天时间，更多地完成任务，12月份就处于十分主动的地位，可以力争更多地超额完成计划任务，又可以有更多的时间进行明年生产的准备。
    赶有赶的艺术。徐州董庄煤矿开展提前完成国家计划的竞赛，就“赶”得很得法。在时间上，他们的奋斗目标是一班任务提前两小时完成；一天任务提前三小时完成；一旬任务提前一天完成；一月任务提前三天完成。这样层层争先，提前完成全年计划就有了可靠的保证，而且可以做到从容不迫。
    生产上的各个环节是相互联系的。上一工序赶在前面去了，如果下一工序跟不上，上一工序要继续提前就有困难。因此，还必须前后左右都提前。只有如此，才不会是相互制约，而是相互促进。董庄煤矿的“提前”竞赛，班班相保，采煤走在计划前，掘进走在回采前，科室管理等工作紧紧赶在生产前等等，就把整个生产组成了一幅纵横交错，环环协调的跃进图，使煤炭产量不断上升。这是一种艺术，是抓紧10月和11月，力争提前完成全年计划的艺术，是组织生产建设持续跃进的艺术。每个企业都应当学会这种“赶”的艺术，充分利用今年最后的两个多月。
