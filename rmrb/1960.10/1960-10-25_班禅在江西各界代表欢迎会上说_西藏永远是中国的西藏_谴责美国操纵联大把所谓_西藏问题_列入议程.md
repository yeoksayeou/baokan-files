Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, October 24th: Panchen Erdeni, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Acting Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, who is currently inspecting Nanchang, said at a welcome reception by representatives from all circles in Jiangxi Province and Nanchang City that Tibet has forever ended its dark old era and entered a new era of bright happiness, prosperity, and development. However, the imperialists and foreign reactionaries are not reconciled to their shameful defeat. Under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, they have included the so-called "Tibet issue" on the agenda of the UN General Assembly, plotting to interfere in our internal affairs once again. We solemnly warn those aggressive imperialists here that all your conspiracies and activities can only end up lifting a rock to drop it on your own feet, and cannot move us a single hair. Tibet will always be the Tibet of the People's Republic of China. Any arrangements and measures taken by our country and government regarding Tibetan affairs are entirely our internal affairs and brook no interference or meddling from any foreign country. Panchen Erdeni's speech received warm applause from the entire audience.

Over two thousand five hundred representatives from all circles in Jiangxi Province and Nanchang City gathered on the evening of the 22nd to warmly welcome Vice Chairman Panchen Erdeni's inspection visit to Jiangxi. Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Liu Chun, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, Guo Xilan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the CPC, Shao Shiping, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the CPC and Governor of Jiangxi Province, and Guo Guangzhou, Alternate Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the CPC and First Secretary of the Nanchang Municipal Committee of the CPC, attended the meeting.

Peng Mengyu, Deputy Governor of Jiangxi Province, spoke at the meeting first. He extended a warm welcome on behalf of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the CPC, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee, and the people of the province to Panchen Erdeni's inspection visit to Jiangxi. Panchen Erdeni said in his speech that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the radiant light of the Party's ethnic policies, the people of all ethnic groups in our country have formed a new type of brotherly close unity characterized by mutual assistance, cooperation, common development, and common progress in the common cause of building a socialist motherland. At all times, we must safeguard the unity of the motherland and the solidarity between the people of all fraternal ethnic groups as we would protect our own lives.

Panchen Erdeni said that Tibet is an inseparable part of our country's territory. After the victory in the suppression of the rebellion, and at the urgent request of the broad masses of working people in Tibet, a earth-shaking democratic reform movement quickly and vigorously unfolded throughout the region. Now, the most brutal, savage, reactionary, and dark feudal serf system in Tibet has been eliminated, and millions of serfs have been liberated, distributed with land, houses, livestock, farm tools and other means of production, and are exercising their rights as masters of their own affairs. With the victory of the democratic reform, the class consciousness of the broad masses of working people has been greatly enhanced, and their enthusiasm for production has soared to unprecedented heights. After completing the land distribution work last year, a mass movement centered on production mutual aid and focused on large-scale agricultural production was quickly launched in the vast rural areas. More than 90% of the households joined agricultural production mutual aid teams, implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in Tibet this year. Panchen Erdeni said that these facts show that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, through democratic reform, and by resolutely taking the socialist road, can the Tibetan people completely get rid of poverty, backwardness, and suffering, and move towards a happy and prosperous new life.

After the meeting, cultural performances were staged. Also present at the meeting were Laming Yexi Chuchen, Standing Committee Member and Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Enjiu Losang Chuqi, Panchen Erdeni's tutor, as well as Panchen Erdeni's father and mother.

    班禅在江西各界代表欢迎会上说
    西藏永远是中国的西藏
    谴责美国操纵联大把所谓“西藏问题”列入议程
    新华社南昌24日电　正在南昌视察的全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼，在江西省和南昌市的各界代表的欢迎会上说，西藏永远结束了黑暗的旧时代，进入了光明幸福、繁荣发展的新时代。但是帝国主义和外国反动派却不甘心于他们的可耻失败，在美帝国主义的操纵下，竟把所谓“西藏问题”列入了联大议程，阴谋再次干涉我国内政。我们在这里严正地警告那些侵略成性的帝国主义者，你们的一切阴谋活动，只能是搬起石头打你们自己的脚，却动不了我们一根毫毛。西藏永远是中华人民共和国的西藏，我们的国家和政府对西藏工作的任何安排和措施完全是我国的内政，绝不容许任何外国干涉过问。班禅额尔德尼的讲话，受到了全场热烈的掌声。
    江西省和南昌市各界代表二千五百余人在22日晚上集会，热烈欢迎班禅额尔德尼副委员长来江西视察访问。中共中央统一战线工作部部长、全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李维汉，民族事务委员会副主任刘春，中共西藏工委副书记郭锡兰，中共江西省委书记、江西省省长邵式平，中共江西省委候补书记、中共南昌市委第一书记郭光洲等出席了大会。
    江西省副省长彭梦庾首先在大会上讲话，他代表中共江西省委、江西省人民委员会和全省人民，对班禅额尔德尼来江西视察访问表示热烈欢迎。班禅额尔德尼在会上讲话说：在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的民族政策光辉照耀下，我国各族人民在建设社会主义祖国的共同事业中，已经结成了互助合作、共同发展、共同进步的兄弟般亲密团结的崭新关系。在任何时候我们都必须像保护自己的生命一样，维护祖国的统一和各兄弟民族人民之间的团结。
    班禅额尔德尼说，西藏是我国领土不可分割的组成部分，在平叛斗争取得胜利以后，在西藏广大劳动人民的迫切要求下，一个翻天复地的民主改革运动很快的在全区轰轰烈烈地开展起来。现在，西藏最残酷、最野蛮、最反动、最黑暗的封建农奴制度已被消灭，百万农奴获得了解放，分得了土地、房屋、耕畜、农具等生产资料，行使着当家作主的权利。随着民主改革的胜利，广大劳动人民的阶级觉悟大大提高，生产积极性空前高涨。去年完成土地分配工作以后，广大农村中迅速掀起了一个以生产互助为中心的大搞农业生产的群众运动，90％以上的农户加入了农业生产互助组，贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”，今年取得了西藏历史上空前未有的大丰收。班禅额尔德尼说，这些事实说明，西藏人民只有在中国共产党的领导下，通过民主改革，坚决走社会主义的道路，才能彻底摆脱贫穷落后的苦难境地，走向幸福美满的新生活。
    会后，演出了文艺节目。出席这次大会的还有西藏自治区筹备委员会常务委员、副秘书长拉敏·益喜楚臣，班禅额尔德尼的经师恩久·洛桑曲企以及班禅额尔德尼的父亲和母亲等。
