Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 29th. The Pathet Lao Fighting Units radio station today broadcast a statement by Tao Ma, the Acting Governor and former Deputy Governor of Sang Neua Province, announcing that Sang Neua Province had overthrown the provincial regime controlled by the Phoumi Nosavan traitor group and restored the authority of the Royal Government.

The statement pointed out that after the formation of the Souvanna Phouma government, it ordered all Royal armed forces to cease hostilities, but the rebel army controlled by the Phoumi Nosavan group defied the government's orders and continued to carry out large-scale "sweeps," burning and killing people. The people of Sang Neua Province, in a state of unbearable suffering, rose up to overthrow the local traitorous regime.

The statement said that the current government of Sang Neua Province was reorganized in accordance with the provisions of the 1958 Vientiane Agreements, and it is a legitimate local political organization under the Royal Government's political system.

The statement announced the important policies to be implemented by the Sang Neua Provincial Government, including:

Unite all ethnic groups, oppose the aggression of American imperialism and the traitorous actions of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Naciampsack group, resolutely implement a policy of peace and neutrality, and achieve genuine national harmony; defend the motherland, religion, the King, and the Constitution; release all patriotic and peace-loving people illegally imprisoned by reactionary groups; liberate the people concentrated by reactionary groups for village consolidation and provide assistance to allow them to return to their homes; purge the lackeys of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Naciampsack group in political organizations at all levels, and dissolve all organizations of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Naciampsack group, such as the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" and the "Democratic Progressive Socialist Party"; guarantee the people's democratic freedoms, protect the people's property, and maintain peace and order; and guarantee equal rights among all ethnic groups.
