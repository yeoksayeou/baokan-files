This newspaper’s Chengdu dispatch of the 16th: Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, is comprehensively innovating cotton processing machinery. Currently, more than 1,200 cotton gins in large and small cotton processing plants throughout the county have undergone systematic reform, and cotton processing efficiency has generally increased by more than double.

This year, the county implemented a method of centralized cotton picking, centralized processing, and centralized sales. The cotton purchase time is concentrated, and the quantity has increased. In order to ensure the timely transfer of new cotton and the rapid pressing of cottonseed cakes to meet the needs of rural fertilizer, the relevant leading departments of the county decided early on to organize various cotton processing plants to vigorously reform tools and improve processing efficiency; at the same time, they grasped the three links of ginning, delinting, and oil extraction together. The county uniformly organized more than 3,700 people from iron, wood, and stone trades to reform and install cotton processing machinery in various communes and management districts. They adopted the method of reforming, test driving, staffing, and ginning at the same time, which accelerated the progress of tool reform and ensured the quality of the reformed tools. The modified roller cotton gins have the advantages of simple structure, easy use, low labor cost, and high efficiency. The more than 1,200 cotton gins that have been modified have all eliminated the heavy labor of manual foot-operated ginning, and have been converted to water, animal, or electric power, and are equipped with automatic flower feeders, seed blocking plates, and cotton receiving boxes. The daily output of these modified cotton gins has increased from 250 jin in the past to 600 jin, and can produce 30 jin of short lint; after the oil extraction equipment was reformed, the daily extraction of cottonseed increased from 600 jin to 2,000 jin. This achieves the requirements of fast ginning, more delinting, and early cake return. According to the cotton processing situation in previous years, at least three to four thousand laborers were required in Pingquan District to complete the task in half a year. Now, the labor force can be reduced by half, and the processing task can be completed in just four months. Using the reformed machines for processing, the flower feeding is even, and the quality of the cotton is also good.

With the goal of timely processing and timely transfer of new cotton, eleven state-owned ginning and processing plants, which account for 20% of the county's cotton processing capacity, have also carried out technical innovation and technical revolution in many ways. For example, the cotton ginning factory of the County Commercial Bureau, through vigorously carrying out technical innovation, has realized the linkage of all production processes such as the in and out of seed cotton and lint warehouses, transportation, flower picking, flower cleaning, and flower feeding, which has increased production efficiency by more than double and can save more than 16,000 yuan in expenses. Four state-owned cotton warehouses have realized automated packaging, and the lint is automatically conveyed upstairs, pressing the cover cloth, opening boxes, returning boxes, lifting bags, receiving bags, and weighing, which reduces the labor intensity of workers and speeds up the transfer of new cotton.

In order to make use of every boll and stalk of cotton, Jianyang County has also vigorously promoted manual cotton stalk peeling machines, autumn peach hulling machines and other processing machinery. Now, each production team has an average of one cotton stalk peeling machine, and each machine peels 100 jin of cotton stalk skin per day, which is ten times more efficient than manual operation. The cotton peach sheller created by the staff of the farm tool factory of the Pingquan District Supply and Marketing Cooperative can be operated by one person to peel 4,000 jin of cotton peaches per day, which is forty times more efficient than manual peeling, and the sheller quality is good, which does not damage the fiber or break the cottonseed, and the cotton and shell can be completely separated.

Jianyang County has also successively organized two county-wide inspections and evaluations of cotton processing tools. Through on-site visits, random sample production tests, going to every place, accepting each machine, and issuing certificates of conformity, the experience of tool reform was exchanged, and the reform of cotton processing tools was promoted.

    简阳全面革新棉花加工机具
    一千二百多台轧花机经过改革提高效率一倍多
    本报成都16日电　四川省简阳县全面革新棉花加工机具。现在，全县大小棉花加工厂的一千二百多台轧花机已经进行了系统的改革，棉花加工效率普遍提高一倍以上。
    这个县今年实行了棉花集中采摘、集中加工、集中出售的办法，棉花收购时间集中，数量增大。为了保证新棉及时外调和迅速榨制棉籽饼，供应农村用肥需要，这个县的有关领导部门早就决定组织各棉花加工厂大力改革工具，提高加工效率；同时把轧花、剥绒和榨油三个环节一齐抓起来。全县统一组织了铁、木、石等工种三千七百多人，分别到各公社和管理区改革和安装棉花加工机具。他们采取边改革、边试车、边配人、边轧花的办法，加快了工具改革的进度，保证了改革工具的质量。经过改装的皮辊轧花机，都具有构造简单、使用轻便、花费劳力少、效率高的优点。已经改装的一千二百多部轧花机，全部消灭了人力踩花的笨重劳动，改用水力、畜力或电力带动，而且都配有自动喂花器、挡籽板和接棉箱。这些经过改制的轧花机，每台日产量由过去的二百五十斤上升到六百斤，并能出短绒三十斤；榨油设备经过改革，由日榨棉籽六百斤，上升到二千斤。这样便达到了快轧花、多剥绒、早返饼的要求。平泉区按照往年棉花加工情况，全区至少要三、四千名劳动力，加工半年才能完成任务。现在，劳力可以减少一半，只要四个月加工任务就可以完成。用经过改革的机器加工，喂花均匀，棉花质量也好。
    以新棉及时加工和及时调运为目标，占全县棉花加工能力20％的十一个国营轧花加工厂，还多方面开展了技术革新和技术革命。如县商业局轧花厂通过大搞技术革新，籽棉皮棉进出仓、运输、拾花、清花、喂花等生产工序全部实现了联动化，生产效率提高一倍以上，可以节省费用一万六千多元。四个国营棉花仓库实现了打包自动化，皮棉上楼、压盖布、开箱、退箱、掀包、接包、过磅，全部自动传送，减轻了工人的劳动强度，加快了新棉调运速度。
    为了把棉花的一絮一秆都利用起来，简阳县还大量推广了手摇棉秆剥皮机、秋桃剥壳机等加工机具。现在，平均每个生产队都有一台棉秆剥皮机，每台日剥棉秆皮一百斤，比手工操作提高效率十倍以上。平泉区供销社农具厂职工创造的棉桃剥壳机，一人操作，可以日剥棉桃四千斤，比手工剥桃提高工效四十倍以上，而且剥壳质量好，既不损坏纤维，又不打破棉籽，棉花和壳能全部分离。
    简阳县还先后组织了两次全县性的棉花加工工具的检查评比，通过现场参观、抽查试产、处处走到、台台验收、合格发证等办法，交流了工具改革的经验，推动了棉花加工工具改革工作。
