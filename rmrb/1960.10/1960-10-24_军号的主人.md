The Owner of the Bugle

    In the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Hall of the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, there is a bugle on display. One day, the owner of this bugle, Comrade Zheng Qi, a combat hero of the Volunteer Army, came to visit the Military Museum. He saw the bugle he had held in his own hands ten years ago, and he was very excited, really wanting to touch this beloved bugle that he had been separated from for many years. Ten years ago, this bugle sounded in the valleys of Korea, inspiring the courage of heroes and scaring the wits out of the devils.

    When the audience learned that the person standing in front of this small copper bugle was the owner of the bugle, everyone enthusiastically gathered around, asking Comrade Zheng Qi to tell the story of this bugle. Comrade Zheng Qi's moving account brought us back to the battlefield of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea ten years ago...

    In November 1950, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army together forced the American bandits toward the vicinity of the 38th parallel. In order to allow the main force to advance smoothly, the Volunteer Army used a small number of troops to block a stubborn enemy of the American invading army in a Korean valley. During the fierce battle, the Volunteer Army commander was wounded. Comrade Zheng Qi was a bugler at the time, but in this emergency, he stepped forward, holding the bugle in one hand and a gun in the other, leading the comrades of the entire company to continue fighting stubbornly against the American devils. In the most difficult moments, Zheng Qi cleverly used the method of blowing the bugle to confuse the enemy. When the enemy launched an attack, Zheng Qi commanded his comrades to calmly respond to the battle. When the enemy was close at hand, a loud and majestic bugle call led to a flurry of hand grenades, severely repelling the enemy. In the smoke-filled area, Comrade Zheng Qi also maneuvered flexibly to redeploy his forces. When the enemy charged again, a burst of gunfire unexpectedly swept in from both sides of the enemy, following the loud bugle call, leaving the enemy disoriented, unable to figure out how many lines of defense the Volunteer Army had, or how many hidden forces there were. Finally, when the enemy charged again, the victory bugle sounded, and the American devils, who had been weakened by the sound of the Volunteer Army's bugle, retreated before the Volunteer Army even fired their guns. In this way, Comrade Zheng Qi and his comrades, relying on their wit and bravery, repelled four enemy attacks. The enemy did not dare to touch death again, and fled south in a panic with a group of defeated soldiers and generals.

    军号的主人
    在中国人民革命军事博物馆抗美援朝战争馆里，陈列着一只军号。一天，这只军号的主人，志愿军战斗英雄郑起同志来参观军事博物馆，他看到了十年前亲手握过的这只军号，心情非常激动，真想再抚摸一下这阔别多年的心爱的军号。十年前，这只军号吹响在朝鲜的山谷，鼓起了英雄的勇气，吓破了鬼子的狗胆。
    当观众们知道了站在这小铜号前面的正是军号的主人，大家都热情地围拢上来，要求郑起同志讲讲这只军号的故事。郑起同志动人心弦的讲述，把我们又引到了十年前的抗美援朝战场上……
    1950年11月，英雄的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一道，把美国强盗向三八线附近追逼。为了让主力军顺利前进，志愿军以少数兵力把美国侵略军一股顽敌阻拦在朝鲜山谷里。在激烈战斗中，志愿军指挥员受伤。郑起同志当时是个司号员，但在这紧急关头，他挺身而出，一手握号、一手拿枪，带领全连战友，继续和美国鬼子顽强作战。在最困难的时刻里，郑起机智地以吹军号的方法来迷惑敌人，当敌人发动冲锋时，郑起指挥战友们沉着应战，等敌人近在眼前时，一阵嘹亮雄壮的军号声引出急促的手榴弹来，狠狠地打退了敌人。在烟雾弥漫中，郑起同志又机动灵活地重新布好兵力，敌人再次冲来时，随着高吹的号音，一阵排子枪出其不意的从敌人两侧扫来，打得敌人晕头转向，摸不清志愿军有多少道防线，有多少埋伏着的兵力。最后，当敌人再次冲来时，又响起胜利的号角，被志愿军号声吓软了的美国鬼子，这一次没等志愿军放枪，就先行撤退了。就这样，郑起同志和战友们，凭着机智和勇敢，打退了敌人四次冲锋，敌人再也不敢来碰死了，在仓皇中和一伙败兵败将向南逃跑了。
