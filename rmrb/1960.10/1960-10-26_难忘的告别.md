    Unforgettable Farewell
    Former Volunteer Army Soldier Zhang Hua
    On the occasion of commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, as a former soldier of the Volunteer Army, I cannot help but recall the scenes of fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army on the Korean battlefield, and I cannot help but cherish the Korean people who established a deep friendship with the Volunteer Army in the battles.
    Speaking of friendship, I have to start with some stories from when our Volunteer Army withdrew from Korea. Those exciting scenes are unforgettable for me. In 1958, in order to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the Chinese People's Volunteers, in accordance with the withdrawal order issued by the Volunteer Army Headquarters, were about to return to the motherland in batches. This matter stirred the hearts of every Korean. Many people prepared the most precious gifts and trekked dozens or even hundreds of miles to the Volunteer Army's station to see us off. When each batch of our Volunteer Army was about to leave a certain position, a certain village, or a certain barracks, the Korean people always came to the Volunteer Army's station, young and old, with tears in their eyes, reluctant to part with each other. Words of friendship were repeated again and again; the crowds seeing us off accompanied us for one journey after another. When we boarded the train, and the train whistle was about to sound, the Korean people wished they could use their arms to hold back the long train. At the moment of farewell, the Korean people scrambled to stuff the gifts they had brought from afar into our hands. Here were family heirlooms passed down for generations, and gold rings and silver earrings used by Korean women when they got married. An old man named Song Mingxue from Yichuan County, Jiangwon Province, gave us a water ladle that his ancestors had used to fight the enemy during the Imjin Patriotic War two hundred years ago, and said meaningfully, "When you return to your country and pick up this water ladle to drink, never forget to fight against the enemy." Grandma Jiang Jinshun from Wondeok-ri, Hongwon County, Hamgyongnam-do, gave the Volunteer Army the gold ring she had saved for more than forty years for her wedding. To thank the Volunteer Army, I don't know how many people, I don't know how many gifts were used to express the Korean people's sentiments. What is most touching and most often recalled by us is the gift from Zhao Dongxu, a woman from Fenghuo-ri, Baechon County, Hwanghae Province. A few days before our withdrawal, Zhao Dongxu received a letter from her husband from the People's Army, which read: "I cannot personally see off the Volunteer Army, so I hope you will give the most precious gift to the Volunteer Army on my behalf..." After reading her husband's letter, she quickly sewed a red silk bag, exquisitely embroidered with two doves symbolizing peace and friendship, and then filled the bag with five kinds of flower seeds, including balsam, sunflower, zinnia, and wild chrysanthemum, and her husband's letter. At the same time, she also attached a letter, which read: "Dear friends, have a safe journey! After returning to your country, when you reunite with your loved ones, please scatter these flower seeds, which represent the sentiments of the Korean people, on your land. When these flowers bloom, I hope you will remember Korea, and I hope to let these flowers of friendship bloom all over China."
    The Korean people's affection and love for the Volunteer Army cannot be expressed in thousands of words, and this sincere friendship is also difficult to describe with pen and ink. Why is there such a precious friendship between our two peoples?
    In the days of the arduous struggle against the American aggressors, on the battlefields filled with war, the people's armies of China and Korea, in order to defend Korea's beautiful rivers and mountains, and in order to protect the peaceful and happy lives of the Chinese and Korean people, always stood shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, sharing life and death, and sharing weal and woe, whether on high mountains or plains, whether in the day or night. For the safety of comrades, they would rather sacrifice their own lives. In order for comrades to be warm and full, they would rather eat wind and sleep in the open. In order to capture a mountain or to hold a tunnel, they were willing to undertake the most arduous tasks themselves. In the most difficult situations, they always encouraged and supported each other. The Korean people always did their best to support us in order to ensure the smooth combat of the Volunteer Army. Regardless of wind, snow, or severe cold, regardless of enemy aircraft strafing, they rushed to rescue the wounded of the Chinese People's Volunteers, repaired roads and bridges, and transported ammunition and supplies, risking their lives. Wherever the Volunteer Army fought, they supported them. The Korean people's support and care for the Chinese People's Volunteers, as close as brothers and sisters, deeply moved us, making the Volunteer Army soldiers far away from their motherland feel as warm as living in their own homes. When every Volunteer Army soldier thought of these things, they felt an incomparably huge force in their bodies. Therefore, every comrade in Korea expressed: In order to extinguish the flames of war and free the Korean people from the ravages of the aggressors as soon as possible, we must dedicate everything, even our lives, to Korea. Here I am reminded of such a thing: On a night in early winter in 1951, we were living in a village near Deokcheon, when we suddenly heard the air defense sentry fire three shots in a row, warning that enemy planes were about to come and make trouble again. Our Volunteer Army vigilantly guarded our respective posts while urging the Korean villagers to quickly enter the air raid shelters. At this time, all the lights in the village had already been extinguished. The enemy sent eight planes in succession, circling over the village, first dropping a flare, followed by a deafening explosion, and the houses immediately caught fire, illuminating the mountains. In the firelight, we saw a pregnant woman hurrying towards the air raid shelter beside the mountain, walking with great difficulty because she was nine months pregnant. Just at that moment, a bomb landed next to her, and the loud noise of the bomb knocked her down. At this time, three soldiers from our company rushed to the woman's side, without even bothering to check where she was injured, and quickly carried her to our bomb shelter. They found that she was not seriously injured, only her right arm had been scratched by shrapnel. The medic in our company bandaged her wound and sent her to our field hospital the next day. A week later, her injury healed, and she gave birth to a fair-skinned baby boy in the hospital. When we went to see her, she said to us with great excitement and tears in her eyes: "My name is Park Sun-hee. A year ago, when the American aggressors first launched the war, my husband asked to join the People's Army, and he was happily approved in February this year. Soon after my husband joined the army, a five-year-old boy and a girl less than three years old were killed by the American bandits' planes. This debt of blood has not yet been settled, and now the aggressors have committed such a heinous crime, not only burning down my house, but almost killing me and the child in my womb. Fortunately, the Volunteer Army not only saved me, but also saved my little life. We, mother and son, will never forget this kindness." Finally, she told us that in order to thank the Volunteer Army, she named her child "Friendship."
    Almost nine years have passed, but when I recall those unforgettable days in Korea, my heart flies again to the other side of the Yalu River.

    难忘的告别
    原志愿军战士　张华
    在纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝十周年的时候，作为一个曾经是志愿军的战士，不能不使我回忆起在朝鲜战场上与朝鲜人民军并肩作战的情景，更不能不使我怀念起在战斗中同志愿军建立了深厚友谊的朝鲜人民。
    提起友谊，还得从我们志愿军撤离朝鲜时的一些故事说起，那些激动人心的场面使我永生难忘。1958年，中国人民志愿军为了促使朝鲜问题的和平解决，遵照志愿军总部颁布的撤军命令，就要分批返回祖国。这件事激动着每个朝鲜人的心。许许多多人准备了最贵重的礼物，跋涉几十里甚至几百里来到志愿军驻地送行。当我们每一批志愿军就要离开某一个阵地，某一个村庄或某一幢营房的时候，朝鲜人民总是扶老携幼来到志愿军驻地，彼此热泪盈眶，依依惜别，显得格外难舍难分。友谊的话说了一遍又一遍；送行的人群送了一程又一程。当我们乘上列车，火车的汽笛快要轰鸣的时候，朝鲜人民恨不得要用自己的手臂去拉住那长长的列车。在送别的时刻，朝鲜人民争着把远道带来的礼物塞到我们的手里，这里有他们祖传几代的传家宝，有朝鲜妇女在出嫁时用的金戒指、银耳环。江原道伊川郡有一位名叫宋明学的老人，把在二百年前壬辰祖国战争时期祖先们曾同敌人作战用的水瓢送给我们，并意味深长地说：“当你们回国后拿起这个水瓢饮水的时候，千万不要忘记同敌人作斗争。”咸镜南道洪元郡元德里老大娘姜今顺把自己保存了四十多年的出嫁时用的金戒指赠给志愿军。为了感谢志愿军，不知有多少人，不知用多少件礼品来表达朝鲜人民的心意。最使人感动的也最使我们经常回忆起的是黄海南道裴川郡逢火里妇女赵东旭的礼品。在我们撤军前几天，赵东旭收到了丈夫一封从人民军那里寄来的信，信上写道：“我不能亲自去欢送志愿军，因此希望你代替我把最贵重的礼物送给志愿军……。”她读完丈夫的信后，火速地缝了一个红绸布口袋，上面精致地绣了象征和平和友谊的两只和平鸽，然后在那口袋里装上凤仙花、葵松花、百日红、野菊花等五种花子和丈夫的信。同时她也附了一封信，信上写道：“爱亲的朋友，一路平安！回到祖国以后，在同你们亲人团聚的时候，请把这些代表朝鲜人民心意的花子撒在你们的土地上，当这些鲜花开放的时候，希望你们回想朝鲜，我希望让这些友谊的花朵开遍中国各地。”
    朝鲜人民对志愿军的情谊与爱戴是千言万语也说不完的，这种真挚的友谊也是难以用笔墨来形容的。为什么在我们两国人民之间会有这样可贵的友谊呢？
    在反抗美国侵略者的艰苦斗争的日子里，在战火弥漫的战场上，中朝两国人民军队为了保卫朝鲜的锦绣江山，为了保卫中朝人民能过安宁的幸福生活，不论在高山、平地，也不论在白天、黑夜，始终肩并肩，手携手，同生死，共患难。为了战友的安全，宁肯牺牲自己的生命。为了战友得到温饱，宁肯自己餐风宿露。为了攻占一个山头，或者为了守住一个坑道，都愿自己来承担最艰巨的任务。在最艰苦的情况下，总是互相鼓励，互相支援。朝鲜人民为了保证志愿军顺利战斗，总是竭尽全力支援我们。他们不顾风雪严寒，不顾敌机扫射，出生入死，抢救中国人民志愿军伤员，抢修公路桥梁，运送弹药物资。志愿军打到哪里，他们就支援到哪里。朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军亲如手足的支援与关怀，深深感动着我们，使远离祖国的志愿军战士感到犹如生活在自己家里那样温暖。当每个志愿军战士想到这些，身上就产生无比巨大的力量。因此，我们每个在朝鲜的同志都表示：为了扑灭战火，使朝鲜人民早日摆脱侵略者的蹂躏，要把自己的一切以至生命献给朝鲜。这里使我想起这样一件事情：在1951年一个初冬的夜晚，我们住在德川附近的一个村庄，忽然听到防空哨一连发出三声枪响，预告着敌机又要来捣乱了。我们志愿军一面各自警惕地守卫在自己的岗位上，一面要朝鲜老乡赶快进入防空洞躲避。这时村庄的灯火早已全部熄灭，敌人先后来了八架飞机，在村庄上空盘旋，先扔下了一颗照明弹，接着就是一阵震耳的爆炸声，房屋顿时起火，把山头都照亮了。在火光中，我们看见一个大着肚子的妇女，急忙向山旁防空洞奔跑，由于身上已怀了九个多月的孩子，走路十分艰难。就在这个时候，一颗炸弹落在她的身边，炸弹的巨响把她震倒了。这时，我们连的三个战士争先扑到那个妇女身边，顾不及察看她的伤处在那里，火速地把她抬到我们的避弹所，发现她并没有受重伤，只是右臂上被炸弹片擦破了一些皮。我们连里的卫生员把伤处包扎了一下，第二天就送到我们的战地医院。一个星期后，她的伤治好了，并在医院里生下了一个白胖胖的小男孩。当我们去看望她的时候，她怀着十分激动的心情，满眶热泪地对我们说：“我叫朴顺姬，一年前，当美国侵略者刚发动战争的时候，我的丈夫就要求参加人民军，今年2月高兴地被批准了。就在我丈夫参军后不久，一个五岁的男孩和一个不到三岁的小女孩都被美国强盗的飞机炸死了，这笔血债还未清算，这次侵略者又犯下了这样滔天的罪行，不但烧掉了我的房屋，差一点我和肚里的孩子都遭到他们杀害，幸亏志愿军，不但救了我，而且救了我的小生命。这个恩德是我们母子两个一辈子也忘不了的。”最后她告诉我们，为了感谢志愿军，她给孩子取了一个名字叫“友谊”。
    事情过去已快九年了，可是，当我回忆起在朝鲜的那些令人难忘的日子，我的心又飞向了鸭绿江彼岸。
