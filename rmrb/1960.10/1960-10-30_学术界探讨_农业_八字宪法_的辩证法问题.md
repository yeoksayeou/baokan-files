Academic Circles Discuss
    The Dialectical Problems of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for Agriculture
    The "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture proposed by Chairman Mao contains rich dialectical content, which has aroused widespread attention in China's philosophical circles. The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly held a symposium to discuss the dialectical problems of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture. Magazines such as "Dialectics of Nature Newsletter" have also published many articles. The speeches at the symposium and the articles that have been published are initially summarized as follows:

    I. The "Eight-Character Constitution" for Agriculture is the Only Method for People to Correctly Handle the Internal and External Contradictions of Crops at the Present Stage. The articles written by Gao Mingwei and the Agronomy Department of Northeast Agricultural College believe that crops are a complex totality of contradictions. There are three types of contradictions in the process of crop growth: The first is the internal contradiction of crops, that is, the mutual dependence, mutual exclusion, and mutual transformation of the assimilation and dissimilation of crops; the second is the contradiction between crops and external environmental conditions; and the third is the contradiction between humans and this organic natural world.

    The method to solve the above three contradictions is the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture. Gao Mingwei said: "The above-mentioned contradictions of different natures have corresponding qualitative solutions at the present stage, and these methods are the eight measures in the 'Eight-Character Constitution' for agriculture, namely, soil, fertilizer, water, seed, density, protection, management, and tools." In order to solve the internal contradiction of crops and strengthen its internal assimilation and dissimilation, it is necessary to transform the crops themselves, so it is necessary to create and cultivate fine varieties. On the other hand, because the process of assimilation and dissimilation of crops is inseparable from the outside world, it is necessary to transform and utilize external conditions. Reasonable close planting can make full use of light energy, heat energy, air, moisture and other inorganic nutrients. Implementing deep plowing, directional soil transformation, rational fertilization, development of water conservancy and rational water use, and strengthening plant protection and field management are to make full use of external conditions and defend against the harmful effects of unfavorable factors in external conditions on crops. As for the contradiction between humans and the natural organic world, the solution is "tools" (tool reform).

    II. The Measures of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for Agriculture are Mutually Promoting, Mutually Dependent, and Mutually Restricting. The articles by Lu Zhesheng and the students of the Agricultural Economics Department of Hubei University believe that the eight characters of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture are a unified whole that is mutually dependent, mutually promoting, and mutually restricting. Close planting is the center of the "Eight-Character Constitution," but close planting cannot be carried out in isolation, it must be linked to a large amount of increased fertilization and increased water. Fertilizer and water are also in mutual connection and mutual restriction. If there is too much fertilizer, water must also be increased, otherwise the crops will be burned to death. With the guarantee of fertilizer and water measures, it is also necessary to improve the soil and expand the cultivated layer, so that the soil has the space to accommodate a large amount of fertilizer and water to improve the storage capacity of fertilizer and water. Soil, fertilizer, water, and density are only the external causes for crops to achieve high yields. These conditions can only play a role through the internal contradictory movement of seeds, so it is necessary to create and cultivate fine varieties. To make the conditions for high agricultural yields such as soil, fertilizer, water, seed, and density give full play, it is also necessary to do a good job in field management and plant protection, otherwise, the goal of high yield will still not be achieved. At the same time, in the process of striving for high crop yields, various yield-increasing measures are strengthened; the cultivation system and cultivation technology are changed; this puts higher demands on production tools and labor. Therefore, only by carrying out tool reform can the shortage of labor be solved and the timely implementation of new agricultural technologies be guaranteed.

    III. The Measures of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for Agriculture are not Parallel, It is Necessary to Grasp the Main Contradiction. The articles by the Agronomy Department of Northeast Agricultural College and Gao Mingwei et al. believe that in many contradictions, there is a distinction between principal contradiction and secondary contradiction, and in a pair of contradictions, there is also a distinction between the principal aspect and the non-principal aspect. In the internal and external contradictions of crops, the main contradiction at the present stage is also the contradiction between crops and cosmic factors, which plays a leading and decisive role in all these contradictions. And it is believed that the method to solve this main contradiction is reasonable close planting. Therefore, close planting becomes the center of the "Eight-Character Constitution," and it is necessary to grasp this main contradiction.

    Lu Zhesheng and the article from Northeast Agricultural College also believe that the principal contradiction and secondary contradiction, the principal aspect and the non-principal aspect of the contradiction are not fixed and immutable, and they transform into each other under certain conditions. When autumn plowing and sowing wheat, the main task is deep plowing, carrying out agricultural activities such as accumulating fertilizer, applying fertilizer, irrigating, and selecting seeds. In March and April of the second year, the wheat enters the greening stage and jointing stage, and at the same time, it is necessary to actively prepare for spring plowing, so accumulating fertilizer and irrigating become the center of agricultural activities at that time.

    IV. The Implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for Agriculture Must Proceed from Reality, and Change with Time, Place, and Conditions. Hai Bo and others believe that when implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, it is necessary to fully base on the local situation: land, climate, manpower, and material resources to determine specific measures. That is to say, it must change with time, place, and conditions. And cannot mechanically apply other people's experience. For example, close planting, it is not the denser the better. In some places, the soil is good, the climate is warm, and there is a lot of manpower and material resources, it is appropriate to plant more densely, which is called reasonable close planting. Some other areas have different conditions and poorer conditions, and planting too densely will cause mistakes. The same is true for fertilization, which must be determined according to soil conditions.

### 学术界探讨  农业“八字宪法”的辩证法问题

    学术界探讨
    农业“八字宪法”的辩证法问题
    毛主席提出的农业“八字宪法”，有丰富的辩证法的内容，引起了我国哲学界的普遍重视。中国农业科学院和中国科学院哲学研究所曾联合召开了座谈会，专门讨论农业“八字宪法”的辩证法问题，《自然辩证法通讯》等杂志还发表了许多文章。座谈会发言和已经发表的文章初步归纳起来，提出了以下几个论点。
    一、农业“八字宪法”是现阶段人们用以正确处理农作物内外矛盾的唯一方法　高明尉和东北农学院农学系所写的文章中都认为，农作物是一个复杂的矛盾总体，它在生育过程中存在着三类矛盾：第一类是农作物的内部矛盾，即农作物的同化作用和异化作用的互相依存、互相排斥和互相转化；第二类是农作物和外界环境条件之间的矛盾；第三类是人同这个有机自然界的矛盾。
    解决以上三种矛盾的方法，就是农业“八字宪法”。高明尉说：“上述各种不同性质的矛盾在现阶段都有与之相适应的不同质的解决方法，这些方法就是农业‘八字宪法’中的八项措施，即土、肥、水、种、密、保、管、工。”为了解决农作物的内部矛盾，加强它内部的同化作用和异化作用，就必须改造作物本身，这样就要创造和培养出良种。另一方面，因为作物的同化、异化过程与外界是分不开的，因此必须改造和利用外界条件。而合理密植，则可以充分利用光能、热能、空气、水分和其他无机营养元素。实行深耕、定向改造土壤、合理施肥、发展水利和合理用水、加强植物保护和田间管理，是充分利用外界条件和防御外界条件中的不利因素对作物的危害。至于人同自然有机界的矛盾，解决的方法是“工”（工具改革）。
    二、农业“八字宪法”的各项措施，是互相促进、互相依存、互相制约着的卢哲生和湖北大学农业经济系同学的文章认为，农业“八字宪法”的八个字之间是一个互相依赖、互相促进、互相制约的统一整体。密植是“八字宪法”的中心，但密植不能孤立地进行，必须与大量的增肥和增水相联系。肥和水也是处于相互联系和相互制约之中的，肥多了水也要增加，否则作物就会烧死。肥、水的措施有了保证，还必须改良土壤和扩大耕作层，使土壤具有能够容纳大量肥、水的空间，以提高肥、水的储存能力。土、肥、水、密只是作物能够高产的外因，这些条件只有通过种子内部矛盾运动才能起作用，因此必须创造和培养良种。要使土、肥、水、种、密等农业高产条件充分发挥作用，还必须做好田间管理和植物保护工作，否则，仍然达不到高产的目的。同时在争取农作物高产的过程中，各项增产措施加强；栽培制度和栽培技术改变；这对生产工具和劳动力又提出更高的要求。因此，只有进行工具改革，才能解决劳动力的不足，保证农业新技术的及时实施。
    三、农业“八字宪法”的各项措施，不是平列的，必须抓住主要矛盾　东北农学院农学系和高明尉等人的文章认为，在许多矛盾中，有主要矛盾与次要矛盾之分，在一对矛盾中也有主要方面与非主要方面之分。在农作物的内外矛盾中，主要矛盾在现阶段也是农作物与宇宙因子间的矛盾，它在所有这些矛盾中起着主导的、决定的作用。并且认为解决这个主要矛盾的方法是合理的密植。因此，密植成为“八字宪法”的中心，必须抓住这个主要矛盾。
    卢哲生和东北农学院的文章还认为，主要矛盾与次要矛盾、矛盾的主要方面和非主要方面，不是固定的、一成不变的，在一定条件下是互相转化的。在秋耕播种小麦时，主要任务是深耕，进行积肥、施肥、灌水、选种等农事活动。第二年3、4月间，小麦返青关、拔节关，同时要积极准备春耕，因而积肥、灌水就成了当时的农业活动的中心。
    四、农业“八字宪法”的贯彻执行，要从实际出发，以时间、地点、条件为转移　海波等人认为，贯彻农业“八字宪法”时，必须充分根据本地的情况：土地、气候、人力、物力来决定具体措施。也就是说，必须以时间、地点、条件为转移。而不能死搬硬套别人的经验。例如密植，并不是越密越好，有的地方土质好，气候温暖，人力、物力多，种得密一些是合适的，叫做合理密植。另一些地区由于条件不同，条件差些，种得过密就会造成错误。施肥也是如此，必须根据土壤情况而定。
