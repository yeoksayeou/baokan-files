Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs Lincoln White declared in a speech on the 12th that "we (the United States) must work with our allies to keep our defenses (i.e., arms expansion and war preparations) strong" and "keep us ahead of the Soviets."
　　White made his warmongering clamor advocating "cold war" and preparing for hot war while speaking at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York. He said that the Soviet leader's so-called "peaceful coexistence" "is by no means peaceful," and the United States "must prepare for a long period, perhaps decades, of relentless competition around the world." In order to carry out his so-called "competition," White emphasized that the United States and the "free world" must currently "maintain sufficient military strength and unity." He emphasized that the United States "must be prepared for a major war" and to this end establish "an invulnerable nuclear deterrent." At the same time, he made it clear that U.S. imperialism will continue to provoke and create "limited wars" everywhere. He said that the United States "must have flexible military capabilities" to conduct "limited wars" because in his view "the possibility of such limited wars occurring is greater than that of a major war." He said: "Since the end of the last war, there have been twenty-two limited wars, from Korea to Lebanon. And there is no reason to believe that limited wars will not occur again."
　　White believes that another thing the United States and the "free world" must do is to step up efforts to win over underdeveloped countries and carry out political and economic expansion in underdeveloped countries. He said that the United States must "broadly demonstrate" that the people of underdeveloped countries can improve their economic status within the so-called "democratic system" of the United States. White emphasized that the United States cannot ignore the "free world" countries that are not allied with the United States. He expressed unease about the vigorous development of colonial and semi-colonial national independence movements and the anti-imperialist struggles of people in various countries, saying that one of the "difficult problems facing the United States is the scale and speed of change in the world." He lamented that "the United States cannot single-handedly guide the revolutionary forces of conflict in the world."
　　At the same time, White vigorously advocated that the United States should step up coercion of its military "allies" to expand armaments and prepare for war and continue to implement U.S. "foreign aid" programs aimed at controlling these countries.
　　White stated that while actively preparing to eliminate the socialist camp by war, the United States must also step up its "subversion" activities against socialist countries in the name of so-called "cultural exchanges." He said that the United States believes that "these exchanges are desirable," and the United States wants to use these "exchanges" to "blow some free atmosphere of American life and thought into the Soviet Union" so that the "evolution" that the United States hopes for can occur there. He said: "The direction of this evolution is more demand for consumer goods" and "more demand" for so-called "personal freedom." White vigorously advocated that the U.S. government should adhere to this vicious plan, saying, "It should not be hoped that this development will produce results overnight; it may take many years."
　　Speaking of the situation at the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, White said that some people say "Khrushchev has taken the initiative in the United Nations" and "the United States and the free world are on the defensive," and he felt "somewhat annoyed" by these statements. He attacked Khrushchev fiercely, saying that Khrushchev's speech at the General Assembly was "negative and aggressive." He also said that the Soviet Union's proposal to reorganize the United Nations administrative structure was to "weaken the United Nations administrative structure and leave only a podium for his propaganda activities." White made it clear that the United States will continue to strongly support UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, who serves the U.S. aggressive policy, and will "try to strengthen the United Nations" as a tool for the United States to pursue its aggressive policy.

    美助理国务卿伯丁发出好战叫嚣
    美国要加紧“冷战”准备热战
    鼓吹用军事手段和思想侵蚀颠覆社会主义国家
    表示将继续利用联合国作推行侵略政策的工具
    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：美国负责公共事务的助理国务卿伯丁12日在一篇演说中叫嚷说，“我们（美国）必须协同我们的盟国使我们的防务（即扩军备战）保持强大”，“使我们一直超过苏联人”。
    伯丁是在纽约伦色莱工艺学院发表演说时发出他的鼓吹“冷战”和准备热战的好战叫嚣的。他说，苏联领袖所说的“所谓的和平共处”“决不是和平的”，美国“必须准备在一个长时期里、也许是几十年的时期里在全球进行无情的竞赛”。为了进行他的所谓“竞赛”，伯丁强调美国和“自由世界”目前必须要“保持足够的军事力量和团结”。他强调说，美国“必须对大战有所准备”，为此而要建立“一支不易遭到攻击的核威慑力量”。他同时表明美帝国主义还要到处挑衅制造“有限战争”。他说，美国“必须拥有灵活的军事能力”来进行“有限战争”。因为在他看来“这种有限战争发生的可能性比大战为大。”他说：“自从上次大战结束以来，从朝鲜一直到黎巴嫩已经进行了二十二次有限战争。而且没有理由认为不会再发生有限战争。”
    伯丁认为美国和“自由世界”必须作的另一件事是要加紧拉拢不发达国家，向不发达国家进行政治经济等等方面的扩张。他说，美国必须“广泛地表明”，不发达国家的人民可以在美国的所谓“民主制度的范围内提高他们的经济地位”。伯丁强调美国不能忽视不同美国结盟的“自由世界”国家。他对殖民地和半殖民地民族独立运动和各国人民的反帝斗争的蓬勃发展表示不安说，美国“面临的困难问题之一是世界上发生的变化规模之大和速度之快”。他哀叹说，“美国靠自力不可能指导全世界冲突的革命的变革力量”。
    伯丁同时大力鼓吹美国要加紧胁迫它的军事“盟国”扩军备战，继续推行目的在于控制这些国家的美国“援外”计划。
    伯丁表示，美国在积极准备用战争手段消灭社会主义阵营的同时，还要加紧以所谓“文化交流”之名来对社会主义国家进行“颠覆”活动。他说，美国认为“这些交流是可取的”，美国要通过这些“交流”来“把美国生活和思想的某些自由气氛吹入苏联”，以便在那里能够发生美国希望的“演变”。他说：“这种演变的方向是更多地要求消费品”和“更多地要求”所谓“个人自由”。伯丁大力鼓吹美国政府要坚持这种恶毒计划，他说，“不应该希望这种发展能在一夜之间产生效果，它或许需要许多年”。
    谈到联合国大会第十五届会议的情况时，伯丁说，有人说“赫鲁晓夫在联合国掌握主动”而“美国和自由世界处于守势”，他对这些说法感到“有些恼火”。他大肆攻击赫鲁晓夫，说赫鲁晓夫在联大的演说是“否定的和攻击性”的。他并且说什么苏联关于改组联合国行政机构的建议是要“削弱联合国的行政机构，而仅仅留下一个讲台来进行他的宣传活动”。伯丁表明，美国今后仍将要继续大力支持为美国侵略政策服务的联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，并将“试图加强联合国”作为美国推行侵略政策的工具。
