    To vigorously develop scientific and technological research in agricultural machinery
    Agriculture is the foundation of the development of our national economy. After agriculture has achieved a basic victory in socialist transformation, the fundamental issue lies in implementing mechanization and improving agricultural labor productivity. To accelerate the progress of agricultural mechanization, vigorously developing scientific and technological research in agricultural machinery is an important task at present.
    In recent years, our country's research work on agricultural implements and agricultural machinery science and technology has made tremendous achievements. There are now more than 600 agricultural machinery research institutions across the country, and more than half of the special districts and counties have established agricultural implement research institutes, as well as dozens of agricultural machinery or mechanization colleges and departments, with thousands of scientific and technical personnel. A large number of skilled craftsmen have also been discovered among workers and peasants. By the end of 1959, more than 520 million improved agricultural implements and semi-mechanized agricultural implements had been researched and promoted nationwide. From 1956 to 1959, nearly half of the agricultural machinery research projects in the National Science and Technology Twelve-Year Plan were completed in four years. Especially in the rural areas after the people's communes in 1958, the most fertile soil for the development of science and technology in our country was formed, and under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the development of agricultural machinery science and technology research was further promoted. Since last winter, a technical innovation and technical revolution movement of agricultural implements and agricultural machinery on an unprecedentedly broad scale has been launched from cities to rural areas. In the movement, a large number of old products of agricultural machinery were reformed and new products were created, so that tractors have moved from imitation to modification and creation, combine harvesters have improved their design, and new agricultural machines have emerged one after another. At present, throughout the country, land cultivated by improved agricultural implements accounts for 80% of all cultivated land, land cultivated by semi-mechanized agricultural implements accounts for 15%, and land cultivated by mechanized agricultural implements accounts for 5%. All these achievements have effectively improved agricultural labor productivity and operation quality, creating conditions for ensuring the continued leap forward in agricultural production.
    According to the experience of various regions, the most central issue in carrying out agricultural machinery scientific and technological research quickly and well is to implement the mass line under the leadership of the Party, mobilize agricultural machinery scientific and technical personnel, agricultural machinery enterprise workers, and the broad masses of peasants to engage in inventions and creations, experiments, improvements, and promotion, and to launch a new upsurge of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement of agricultural implements and agricultural machinery. To implement agricultural mechanization, it is necessary to combine agricultural machinery scientific and technical personnel, agricultural machinery enterprise workers, and peasants, and carry out communist cooperation; to closely integrate people who research, manufacture, and use agricultural machinery, to combine theory and practice, and to combine the popularization and improvement of agricultural machinery science and technology. The key to doing a good job in the "three combinations" is to further strengthen the leadership of professional personnel, to repeatedly conduct political and ideological education for them, so that professional personnel actively and consciously go deep into the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement, learn from the masses, discover the creations of the masses, absorb the wisdom of the masses, help the masses summarize experience, and improve the level of research. The practice of separating from the broad masses of peasants is unworkable. In the Agricultural Machinery Research Institute of Jiaxing Special District, Zhejiang, an engineer "shut himself in his room" and created a rice transplanter weighing hundreds of kilograms in two months, which could not be dragged even when it was taken to the field. Later, under the instruction of the Prefectural Party Committee, he closely combined research work with mass scientific and technological activities, analyzed the advantages and characteristics of various rice transplanters on the basis of the originally created rice transplanter, and trial-produced a rice transplanter with low cost, simple structure, easy operation, and good performance. Facts have proved that good things can only be created by closely connecting with reality and being with the masses. Many other research units have invited skilled craftsmen from rural areas to the research institute to cooperate with scientific and technical personnel, which has also achieved tremendous results. Wang Wenren, a researcher and old blacksmith at the Agricultural Implement Research Institute in Xifeng County, Liaoning, managed to make the diesel engine grow legs, so that a diesel engine could be moved at any time and fully utilized. Another researcher, Wang Keren, an old carpenter, created a straw disintegrator, which thrashed the straw after the thresher had finished threshing it once, so as to return the grains to the field.
    In order to carry out agricultural machinery scientific research in an organized, planned, and focused manner, the leadership must formulate agricultural machinery scientific and technological research plans based on the actual conditions and needs of each region, and give priority to using improved agricultural implements or mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural implements for agricultural work that requires the most labor, the heaviest physical labor, and the strongest seasonality; at the same time, various agricultural machines should be gradually "coordinated into a dragon" in order to comprehensively improve labor efficiency. In order to make agricultural machinery scientific and technological research work achieve results faster, we must use both indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the main focus, adapt to local conditions, and make the best use of talents. Some people believe that improved agricultural implements are indigenous methods with low levels, so they have not given them enough attention, which is wrong. It should be known that indigenously made improved agricultural implements and semi-mechanized agricultural implements have local characteristics of our country. Some indigenous methods may not be able to catch up with foreign methods for a while, but indigenous methods are native and not only can they solve the current practical problems, but also after improvement, they will definitely be able to surpass existing foreign machines. It is necessary to combine "indigenous" products with local characteristics of our country with "foreign" machinery for research in order to produce agricultural implements and tools suitable for the unique conditions of various parts of our country. It should be seen that among the improved agricultural implements created by the broad masses, the embryos of high, sophisticated, and cutting-edge agricultural machinery science and technology in our country are gestating. Combining our country's actual situation, obeying the needs of agricultural production, and adopting the method of focusing on research on improved agricultural implements and tools, and combining research on improved agricultural implements and tools with research on high, sophisticated, and cutting-edge agricultural machinery science and technology, is a research method that is more, faster, better, and more economical. The rice transplanter with a novel structure that meets the requirements of close planting was produced on the basis of improved agricultural implements. It can be seen that the research on improved agricultural implements and the research on high, sophisticated, and cutting-edge technologies should be both emphasized and should not be neglected.
    Promoting research results and combining research work with promotion work is an important link in carrying out agricultural machinery scientific and technological research work. Only by promoting research results can the research results be better subjected to practical tests, continuously improved and improved, and more in line with local needs. The Nanjing Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute's motor-electric dual-purpose rope traction machine, peanut harvester, etc., were originally derived from the experience and creation of the masses. In the process of promotion, the masses were also mobilized to experiment, and everyone offered ideas and jointly solved key problems, so that it was continuously improved and improved in the process of promotion. The evaluation, selection, and finalization meetings of research results adopted by various regions in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement are a good form of promotion work with creative use of the "three combinations" method. These practices can effectively and rapidly improve the level of research and promote the already finalized agricultural machinery.
    At present, in order to meet the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing, agricultural implement and agricultural machinery research work must seize the opportunity, plan to promote the achievements that have been made, and accelerate the research work on those research projects that are close to the successful stage, and strive to achieve results as soon as possible for promotion, in order to strive for the victory of this year's autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing, and for the continued leap forward in agricultural production next year.

    大力开展农业机械科学技术的研究工作
    农业是我国国民经济发展的基础，农业在社会主义改造取得了基本胜利以后，根本问题在于实行机械化，提高农业劳动生产率。为了加速农业机械化的进展，大力开展农业机械科学技术的研究工作，是当前的一项重要任务。
    近年来，我国的农具和农业机械科学技术的研究工作，已取得了巨大成就。现在全国共有农业机械研究机构六百多个，有半数以上的专区和县建立了农具研究所，数十个农业机械或机械化学院、系，科学技术人员达数千人，在工农群众中还发现了大量的能工巧匠。到1959年底，全国已研究推广了各种改良农具和半机械化农具五亿二千多万件。从1956年到1959年四年中，完成了国家科学技术十二年规划中七年农业机械研究项目的近半数。特别是在1958年人民公社化以后的农村，成了发展我国科学技术最肥沃的土壤，在各级党委的领导下，更推动了农业机械科学技术研究工作的开展。去冬以来，各地从城市到农村，掀起了一个规模空前广泛的农具和农业机械技术革新和技术革命运动。在运动中，各地大量改革农业机械的老产品，创制新产品，使拖拉机由仿制走向改制和创造，联合收割机改进了设计，新的农业机具纷纷出现。现在，在全国范围内，依靠改良农具耕种的土地，已占全部耕地的80％，依靠半机械化农具耕种的占15％，依靠机械化农具耕种的占5％。所有这些成就的取得，有效地提高了农业劳动生产率和作业质量，为保证农业生产继续跃进创造了条件。
    根据各地的经验，要又快又好地开展农业机械科学技术的研究工作，最中心的问题，就是要在党的领导下贯彻群众路线，发动农业机械科学技术人员、农业机械企业职工和广大农民，大家动手来搞发明创造，来搞试验、改进和推广，掀起农具和农业机械的技术革新和技术革命运动的新高潮。实行农业机械化，必须使农业机械科学技术人员、农业机械企业职工和农民“三结合”，开展共产主义大协作；使研究、制造和使用农业机械的人很好地结合，使理论和实践结合，使农业机械科学技术的普及和提高结合。要搞好“三结合”，关键在于进一步加强对专业人员的领导，对他们反复地进行政治思想教育，使专业人员积极自觉地深入到群众的技术革新和技术革命运动中去，向群众学习，发现群众的创造，吸取群众的智慧，帮助群众总结经验，提高研究水平。脱离广大农民群众的作法是行不通的。在浙江嘉兴专区农业机械研究所，一位工程师“闭门造车”，两个月时间创制了一部几百公斤重的插秧机，拿到田里拖也拖不动。后来，在地委的指示下，他把研究工作和群众性的科学技术活动密切结合起来，在原来创造的插秧机的基础上，分析了各种插秧机的优点和特点，试制成了成本低、结构简单、操作容易、性能良好的插秧机。事实证明只有紧密联系实际，和群众在一起才能搞出好东西来。还有不少研究单位，把农村中的能工巧匠请到研究所来和科学技术人员一起合作，也收到了巨大的效果。辽宁西丰县的农具研究所研究员老铁匠王文仁就设法使柴油机长了腿，一台柴油机可以随时搬动，得以充分利用。另一个研究员老木工王克仁，就创造了一个打乱稻草机，把脱谷机打完以后的乱稻草再打一次，作到颗粒还家。
    为了有组织、有计划、有重点地进行农业机械科学研究，领导上必须根据各个地区的实际情况和需要，制定农业机械科学技术研究的规划，尽先让用劳力最多、体力劳动最重、季节性最强的农活，用上改良农具或机械化半机械化农具；同时要使各种农业机具，逐渐“配套成龙”，以便综合地提高劳动效率。为了使农业机械科学技术研究工作更快地取得成效，我们必须土洋并举，以土为主，因地制宜，人尽其才。有些人认为改良农具是土办法、水平低，因此没有予以足够的重视，这是不对的。要知道，土造的改良农具和半机械化农具，是具有我国地方特色的。一部分土办法，一时赶不上洋办法，但土办法是土生土长的，不但可以解决当前的实际问题，而且经过提高，也一定能够胜过现有的洋机械。必须把具有我国地方特色的“土”产品和“洋”机械结合起来研究，才能产生适合我国各地特有条件的农具和工具。应当看到在广大群众所创造的改良农具中，孕育着我国农业机械科学技术高、精、尖的胚胎。结合我国的实际情况，服从农业生产需要，采取以研究改良农具、工具为主，研究改良农具、工具和研究农业机械科学技术高、精、尖相结合的两条腿走路的方法，是多快好省的研究方法。结构新颖合乎密植要求的水稻插秧机，就是在改良农具的基础上产生的。可见，改良农具的研究和高、精、尖的研究既要有所侧重，又是不可偏废的。
    推广研究成果，把研究工作和推广工作结合起来，这是开展农业机械科学技术研究工作的一个重要环节。只有推广研究成果，才能使研究成果更好地经受实际的检验，不断地得到改进和提高，更加符合当地的需要。南京农业机械化研究所创制的电机两用绳索牵引机、花生收获机等，原来是取之于群众的经验和创造，在推广过程中，又发动群众试验，大家出主意，共同解决了关键问题，使它在推广过程中不断得到了改进和提高。各地在技术革新和技术革命运动中，所采取的对研究成果的评比、选型、定型等会议，就是一种富有创造性的、运用“三结合”的方法进行推广工作的好形式，这些做法能够有效地迅速地提高研究的水平和推广已经定型的农业机具。
    目前，为了迎接秋收秋耕秋种，农具和农业机械研究工作，必须抓紧时机，有计划地把已经取得的成果加以推广，对那些接近于成功阶段的研究项目，要加速进行研究工作，尽快地取得成果加以推广，为争取今年秋收秋耕秋种的胜利，和为明年农业生产的继续跃进而努力。
