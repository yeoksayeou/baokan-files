Report on the Political and Theoretical Study Work Conferenceof the National Committee of the Chinese People's PoliticalConsultative Conference
(Approved by the 11th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on September 26, 1960)

Chairman, Standing Committee:

Based on the work report made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong at the Second Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a work conference on political study and theoretical study was held in Beijing from July 1st to 17th. One hundred and eighty-one people attended the meeting. The meeting discussed the principles, tasks, and teaching methods of political and theoretical study, and exchanged experiences. The meeting was very successful. The main issues and opinions are now reported as follows for review.

(I)

The meeting clarified that the task of political and theoretical study in the future is to help members of democratic parties, non-party democrats, industrialists and businesspeople, and intellectuals to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, and gradually transform their worldviews.

Due to the continuous Great Leap Forward in socialist construction and the in-depth development of the socialist revolution, the entire social life is undergoing a drastic transformation of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology. Every step forward in society inevitably leads to contradictions with the politics and ideology of the bourgeoisie. Under such historical conditions, members of democratic parties, non-party democrats, industrialists and businesspeople, and intellectuals must study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works to raise their understanding and gradually transform their bourgeois worldviews (positions, viewpoints, and methods) in order to adapt to the rapidly developing objective situation.

Over the past decade, democratic parties, non-party democrats, industrialists and businesspeople, and intellectuals have made great progress under the leadership of the Party. This is manifested in: (1) The majority of people have politically turned to the left. A considerable number of them, more than in the past, have basically turned to the socialist position; a considerable number of people, possibly slightly more than the former, have turned to a semi-socialist position. Only a small number of people basically still hold a capitalist position. (2) The enthusiasm of the majority of people for serving socialism has significantly increased. (3) The majority of people have raised their awareness of self-transformation, and the number of people requesting to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works has gradually increased. These subjective and objective conditions are very beneficial for their further transformation. In the future, we should seize this favorable situation, greatly help them strengthen their political and theoretical study, raise their understanding, and carry out self-transformation.

Some people believe that proposing the transformation of worldviews means that the transformation of political positions has been completed or is no longer important. This is incorrect. The issue of political position is the primary and fundamental issue in one's worldview. According to the current political and ideological situation of members of democratic parties, non-party democrats, industrialists and businesspeople, and intellectuals, those holding a semi-socialist position still need to continue transforming their political positions; those who basically hold a capitalist position, of course, need to strengthen the transformation of their political positions; even those who have basically turned to the socialist position, some need to further consolidate their position, and some need to further undergo a thorough transformation. The transformation of worldviews requires great effort and a long time; therefore, we must oppose those who relax transformation and deny the need for transformation, and also oppose those unrealistic practices that demand excessive haste.

(II)

Mao Zedong Thought is a model of the integration of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution and construction. Chairman Mao fully carried forward the revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism and safeguarded and developed Marxism-Leninism under China's specific conditions. To study Marxism-Leninism, one must study Mao Zedong's works. Seriously studying Mao Zedong's works can help oneself understand the laws of natural and social development, master one's own destiny, distinguish right from wrong in the storms of class struggle at home and abroad, and stand firm; and make more contributions in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace, in socialist revolution and socialist construction. Therefore, we must promote and organize members of democratic parties, non-party democrats, industrialists and businesspeople, and intellectuals to earnestly study Mao Zedong's works and push the study to a new stage.

When studying Mao Zedong's works, we should focus on the following three aspects: First, dialectical materialism, with "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" as the main study documents. Second, historical materialism, with "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" as the main study documents, combined with the study of "On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship," "More On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship," and the three articles commemorating the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth. Focus on studying: classes and class struggle, proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, national liberation movements, two types of contradictions, revolutionary united front, and other issues. Third, the issue of socialist construction. Focus on studying the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. The content of study can be varied, increased or decreased, and the order can be prioritized depending on different objects, different work positions, and different needs, without rigidly demanding uniformity.

(III)

To study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, one must integrate theory with practice. Integrating theory with practice includes two aspects: one is to connect with objective reality, that is, how to correctly understand and transform the objective world; the other is to connect with subjective reality, that is, how to correctly understand and transform one's own subjective world. In the study, there is a liberal attitude of inconsistency between words and deeds, and there is also a dogmatic method of studying for the sake of theory, both of which are theory divorced from practice and cannot enable people to achieve the purpose of study. We advocate a consistent attitude and method of learning that integrates theory and practice, learns for practical purposes, seeks truth from facts, and opposes the liberal attitude of learning and the dogmatic method of learning. In the teaching work of political schools, there are also two tendencies: one is to one-sidedly emphasize the study of current affairs and policies, and ignore the study of the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism, which is of course wrong; the other is to adopt an "academic" teaching method, or to require everyone to read the classic works of Marxism-Leninism regardless of the target, which is also wrong. In political schools, the focus should be on studying the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism, and using the learned theories to analyze and study current affairs and policy issues and self-transformation issues. This will help overcome the bias in study and teaching work, and closely integrate theory with practice.

(IV)

To study politics and theory, we must adopt the principles of conscientiousness, voluntariness, independent thinking, and free debate. Without a conscious and voluntary foundation, and without adopting the method of independent thinking and free debate, it is impossible to learn well.

To study politics and theory, we must adopt the methods of gentle breeze and fine rain, and persuasive education. Problems in the ideological field "can only be solved by discussion, criticism, and persuasive education, and cannot be solved by coercive or oppressive methods." (Mao Zedong: "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") Many places have used the method of gentle breeze and fine rain in political and theoretical study, and have achieved experience and success. Since this year, the experience of "immortals' gatherings" has been developed in the transformation work of people from all walks of life. "Immortals' gatherings" are a mass self-education and self-transformation method under the correct direction and correct leadership. This method is more conducive to helping each other, enlightening each other, revealing contradictions, analyzing problems, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and therefore more conducive to earnestly, carefully, and deeply discussing and solving some ideological problems, and improving people's consciousness and enthusiasm. Speaking out freely, airing views fully, big-character posters, and great debates are important methods of the rectification movement. In ordinary political and theoretical study, it is appropriate not to adopt these methods, but to adopt the above-mentioned methods.

During the transition period in our country, the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie, in most cases, manifests as a contradiction among the people. The methods of gentle breeze and fine rain and "immortals' gatherings" are good methods for conducting class struggle and political and ideological education in our country under these circumstances. Gentle breeze and fine rain is not no wind and no rain, not canceling ideological struggle. It is wrong to use gentle breeze and fine rain as an excuse to evade criticism and self-criticism, and evade ideological transformation. Of course, there should be criticism and self-criticism in political and theoretical study, but there should also be encouragement, and even small progress should be welcomed. This will help promote people to continue self-transformation and achieve greater progress.

(V)

The political and theoretical study of members of democratic parties, non-party democrats, industrialists and businesspeople, and intellectuals is largely and frequently on-the-job spare-time study, which should be grasped practically and promoted earnestly. At the same time, various regular off-the-job studies should be vigorously organized, and efforts should be made to ensure that key members participate in off-the-job studies in rotation within the next three years in accordance with the principle of voluntariness. To carry out political and theoretical study, diverse forms of learning organizations should be adopted, combining spare-time study and off-the-job study, and blooming everywhere. Local CPPCCs should, under the leadership of the CCP committees, make specific plans and take active measures to solve the problems of study backbones, teaching materials, teachers, and necessary funds and equipment, so as to effectively carry out political and theoretical study work.

(VI)

Regarding two specific issues of political schools (socialist colleges):

1.  The labor training of members of democratic parties, non-party democrats, industrialists and businesspeople, and intellectuals should be appropriately arranged in their work positions, and no further labor training should be arranged in political schools, so that students can concentrate their energy and time to better study politics and theory.

2.  Political schools generally admit personnel under the age of 55 who are in good health. Those over 55 years old should participate in study organizations such as study seminars; however, if their health conditions permit and they voluntarily request to enroll, they may also be admitted with the school's consent.

    关于中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会政治、理论学习工作会议的报告
    （1960年9月26日中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会第十一次会议审查同意）主席、常务委员会：
    根据陈叔通副主席在中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第二次会议上所作的工作报告，于7月1日至17日在北京召开了政治学习和理论学习的工作会议。参加会议的有一百八十一人。会议讨论了政治、理论学习的方针、任务、教学方法等问题，交流了经验，会议开得很好。现在将主要问题和意见报告如下，请予审查。
    （一）
    会议明确了，今后政治、理论学习的任务是帮助民主党派成员、无党派民主人士、工商界和知识界学习马克思列宁主义、毛主席著作，兴无灭资，逐步改造世界观。
    由于社会主义建设的持续大跃进和社会主义革命的深入发展，整个社会生活处在兴无灭资的急剧变革当中，社会每前进一步，都不可避免地同资产阶级的政治、思想发生矛盾。民主党派成员、无党派民主人士、工商界和知识界处在这样的历史条件下，必须学习马克思列宁主义、毛主席著作，提高认识，逐步改造资产阶级的世界观（立场、观点、方法），才能适应飞速发展着的客观形势。
    十多年来，民主党派、无党派民主人士、工商界和知识界在党的领导下，有了很大的进步。这表现在：（1）大多数人在政治上向左转化。其中相当多的一部分人，即比以往较多的人，基本上转到社会主义立场；相当多的一部分人，可能是比前一部分多一点的人，转到半社会主义立场。只是一小部分人基本上还是资本主义立场。（2）大多数人为社会主义服务的积极性有了显著的提高。（3）多数人提高了自我改造的自觉性，要求学习马克思列宁主义、毛主席著作的人逐渐增多起来。这种主客观条件对于他们进一步改造是十分有利的，今后应当抓紧这一有利形势，大大帮助他们加强政治、理论学习，提高认识，进行自我改造。
    有人认为提出改造世界观就意味着政治立场的改造已经完成了，或者不重要了，这是不对的。政治立场问题是世界观中首要的和基本的问题。根据民主党派成员、无党派民主人士、工商界和知识界目前的政治、思想情况，半社会主义立场的人，仍须继续改造政治立场；基本上是资本主义立场的人，当然更需要加强政治立场的改造；就是那些已经基本上转到社会主义立场来的人，有的还需要进一步巩固，有的还需要进一步进行彻底的改造。世界观的改造需要很大的努力和很长的时间；因此，既要反对那些放松改造，否认还需要改造的思想，也要反对那些要求过急的不切实际的做法。
    （二）
    毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命和建设实践相结合的典范。毛主席充分地发扬了马克思列宁主义的革命精神，在我国的具体条件下，保卫了和发展了马克思列宁主义。学习马克思列宁主义，必须学习毛主席著作。认真学习毛主席著作，可以帮助自己认识自然和社会发展的规律，掌握自己的命运；在国内外阶级斗争的风浪中，辨别是非，站稳脚跟；在反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的斗争中，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，作出更多的贡献。因此，必须推动和组织民主党派成员、无党派民主人士、工商界和知识界认真学习毛主席著作，把学习推向一个新的阶段。
    学习毛主席著作，应当着重学习下列三个方面：一、辩证唯物主义，以“实践论”和“矛盾论”为主要学习文件。二、历史唯物主义，以“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“论人民民主专政”为主要学习文件，结合学习“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”、“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”和纪念列宁诞生九十周年的三篇文章。着重学习：阶级和阶级斗争，无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，民族解放运动，两类矛盾，革命统一战线等问题。三、社会主义建设问题。着重学习总路线、大跃进和人民公社等问题。对于不同对象、不同工作岗位、不同需要的人，学习的内容可以有所侧重，有所增减，次序可以有所先后，不必强求一律。
    （三）
    学习马克思列宁主义、毛主席著作，必须理论联系实际。理论联系实际包括两个方面：一是联系客观实际，即如何正确认识和改造客观世界的问题；一是联系主观实际，即如何正确认识和改造自己的主观世界的问题。在学习中，存在着言行不一致的自由主义态度，同时也存在着为理论而理论的教条主义的学习方法，这都是理论脱离实际，不能使人们达到学习的目的。我们提倡言行一致、学用一致、有的放矢、实事求是的学习态度和学习方法，反对自由主义的学习态度和教条主义的学习方法。在政治学校的教学工作中，也存在着两种倾向：一种是片面强调时事政策的学习，忽视马克思列宁主义基础理论的学习，这当然是不对的；另一种是采取“学院式”的教学方法，或者不问对象，一律要求读马克思列宁主义的经典著作，这也是不对的。在政治学校中，应当以学习马克思列宁主义基础理论为主，并运用学习到的理论去分析研究时事政策问题和自我改造方面的问题。这样，就会有利于克服学习中和教学工作中的偏向，使理论和实际密切结合起来。
    （四）
    学习政治、理论，必须采取自觉、自愿、独立思考、自由辩论的原则。没有自觉、自愿的基础，不采取独立思考、自由辩论的方法，是不可能学好的。
    学习政治、理论，必须采取和风细雨、说服教育的方法。思想领域的问题，“只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”（毛主席：“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）许多地方，在政治、理论学习中运用了和风细雨的方法，取得了经验和成绩。今年以来，在各界民主人士的改造工作中，发展了“神仙会”的经验。“神仙会”是在有正确方向和正确领导之下，一种群众性的自我教育和自我改造的方法。这种方法更有利于互相帮助，互相启发，更有利于揭露矛盾，分析问题，更有利于开展批评和自我批评，因此更有利于认真、细致、深入地讨论和解决一些思想问题，提高人们的自觉性和积极性。大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论是整风运动的重要方法。在寻常的政治、理论学习中，以不采用这种方法、而采取上述方法为宜。
    在我国过渡时期，工人阶级同民族资产阶级之间的矛盾，在大多数情况下，表现为人民内部的矛盾。和风细雨和“神仙会”的方法，就是我国在这种情况下进行阶级斗争和政治、思想教育的一种好的方法。和风细雨不是无风无雨，不是取消思想斗争。借口和风细雨，回避批评和自我批评，回避思想改造，是不对的。当然，在政治、理论学习中要有批评和自我批评，也要有鼓励，那怕是微小的进步，也要采取欢迎的态度。这样，就有利于推动人们继续进行自我改造，获得更大的进步。
    （五）
    民主党派成员、无党派民主人士、工商界和知识界的政治、理论学习，大量的、经常的是在职的业余学习，应当切实抓紧，认真推动。同时要大力举办各种定期的离职学习，争取在今后三年内按自愿原则使骨干分子大体上轮流参加一次离职学习。举办政治、理论学习，应当采用多种多样的学习组织形式，业余学习和离职学习并举，遍地开花。各地政协应当在中共党委的领导下，加以具体规划，并采取积极措施，解决学习骨干、教材、教员和必要的经费、设备等方面的问题，以利于把政治、理论学习工作切实地开展起来。
    （六）
    关于政治学校（社会主义学院）的两个具体问题：
    一、民主党派成员、无党派民主人士、工商界和知识界的劳动锻炼，应当在工作岗位上加以适当安排，在政治学校中不必再安排劳动锻炼，以便学员集中精力和时间更好地学习政治、理论。
    二、政治学校一般吸收五十五岁以下、健康相当的人员入学。年龄在五十五岁以上的，以参加学习座谈会等学习组织为宜；但是如果他们健康条件许可、而又自愿要求入学，经学校同意，也可吸收。
