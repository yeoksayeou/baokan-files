Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 9th: The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has organized production and life inspection groups to go deep into production teams and production brigades. By laboring and producing alongside commune members, they are helping production teams and production brigades arrange current production and life, and do a good job in autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing, laying the foundation for striving for a bumper autumn harvest and winning a bumper harvest in agricultural production next year.

This inspection group is composed of a large number of key personnel drawn from provincial-level directly affiliated organizations who are relatively familiar with rural work. More than 7,000 cadres at all levels are participating, making this an unprecedented large-scale inspection. Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, serves as the head of the general group. Zhang Tixue, Secretary of the Secretariat and Governor of the Province, and Secretaries Wang Yanchun, Liu Yangqiao, Zhao Xinchu, Xu Daoqi, and Wang Shucheng serve as deputy heads of the general group. In addition to the general group, the inspection group has also formed eight sub-groups based on regional characteristics and transportation, water conservancy, and other fronts. The inspection time is one month to one and a half months.

Prior to this, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China had transferred a large number of cadres to strengthen the front line of agricultural production. Recently, it transferred members of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee, the Secretary-General, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Committee, the Deputy Director of the Agricultural Office, and the Deputy Minister of the Organization Department to the Jingzhou area to serve as the First Secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee, Secretary of the Secretariat, and County Party Committee First Secretaries. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee also decided that Secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat and Vice Governors of the Provincial People's Committee would be responsible for assisting work in different regions.

The current rural situation in Hubei Province is very good. The harvesting of mid-season rice, which accounts for a large proportion of the annual grain output, has basically ended, and the harvesting of late autumn crops, including late rice, sweet potatoes, and miscellaneous grains, has also begun. While striving for a bumper autumn harvest, a large-scale production campaign centered on autumn plowing and sowing has been fully launched across the province. Sowing of early-season areas and some early-sown crops has already begun. To date, more than 9 million mu of wheat, barley, rapeseed, and bean crops have been sown throughout the province, and the sowing quality is generally better than in the past. Various regions are continuing to rush-plant, striving to expand the autumn planting area. The Provincial Party Committee believes that October is a crucial month for agricultural production. It not only relates to this year's grain harvest but also relates to the continued leap forward in agricultural production next year. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee has specially organized this large-scale inspection to promote further efforts in grasping the current production in various regions and to advance on the basis of the victories already achieved in the previous stage. The Provincial Party Committee requires comrades participating in the inspection group to earnestly participate in production in the production teams. By eating, living, working, and consulting with commune members, they should understand the demands of the masses, thoroughly implement policies, and strengthen the work of the production brigades. At the same time, they should humbly accept the opinions of the masses, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, down-to-earth work, burying oneself in hard work, and striving for strength, serve as advisors to the communes and production teams, and work with the broad masses to effectively carry out autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing.

    湖北省委检查三秋工作
    组织生产生活检查团，跟社员四同，帮助生产队安排秋收秋耕秋种工作
    新华社武汉9日电　中共湖北省委组织生产、生活检查团，深入到生产队和生产小队，通过和社员一道劳动生产，帮助生产队和生产小队安排好当前生产、生活，搞好秋收、秋耕、秋种，为争取秋收作物颗粒归仓和夺取明年农业生产丰收打下基础。
    这个检查团是由省级直属机关抽调大批比较熟悉农村工作的骨干组成的，参加的各级干部达七千多人，这是一次规模空前的大检查。省委第一书记王任重担任总团团长，书记处书记、省长张体学，书记王延春、刘仰峤、赵辛初、许道琦、王树成等担任副总团长。检查团除设总团外，还根据地区特点和交通、水利等战线组成了八个分团。检查时间一个月到一个半月。
    在这以前，中共湖北省委曾抽调大批干部充实农业生产第一线，最近，又抽调省委常委、秘书长、省委副秘书长，农业办公室副主任，组织部副部长等人，到荆州地区担任中共地委第一书记、书记处书记和县委第一书记工作。与此同时，省委还决定省委书记处书记、省人民委员会副省长按地区分片负责帮助工作。
    湖北省当前的农村形势很好。占全年粮食产量比重大的中稻收获工作已经基本结束，晚秋作物，包括晚稻、红苕、杂粮等的收获也已开始。各地在力争秋收多多益善的同时，以秋耕秋种为中心的大规模的生产运动已经全面展开。季节早的地区和部分早种作物的播种工作已经开始，到目前止，全省播下的小麦、大麦、油菜和豆类作物已达九百多万亩，播种质量一般比过去好。各地正在继续抢种，力争扩大秋种面积。省委认为，10月是农业生产的关键月，它不仅关系到今年的粮食收成，同时还关系到明年农业生产的继续跃进。因此省委特地组织了这次大检查，以便促进各地进一步抓好当前生产，在前段已经取得的胜利基础上乘胜前进。省委要求参加检查团的同志扎扎实实地深入生产队参加生产，通过和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，了解群众的要求，深入地贯彻政策，加强小队工作。同时，虚心接受群众意见，发扬艰苦奋斗、脚踏实地、埋头苦干、发愤图强的革命精神，做好公社、生产队的参谋，和广大群众一道，切实搞好秋收、秋耕、秋种。
