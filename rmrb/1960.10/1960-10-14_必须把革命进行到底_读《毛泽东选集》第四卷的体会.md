    We Must Carry the Revolution Through to the End
    ——Reflections on Reading Volume IV of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"
    Ouyang Qin
    (Continued from yesterday)
    (II) On the question of the united front. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The Chinese New Democratic Revolution cannot be victorious without the broadest united front including the overwhelming majority of the national population. Moreover, this united front must be under the firm leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Any revolutionary united front cannot be victorious without the firm leadership of the Chinese Communist Party." The essence of the united front, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, is to develop progressive forces, broadly win over allies, unite all who can be united, and isolate the enemy to the greatest extent possible, thereby achieving the victory of the revolution.

    Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the experience of the Chinese revolution, developed the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and formed a complete and correct set of policies regarding the revolutionary united front. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the Chinese proletariat, the peasant class, and other petty bourgeoisie are the basic driving forces of the revolution, the proletariat is the leading force of the revolution, and the peasants are the firm allies of the proletariat. Without the participation of the peasants, who constitute the vast majority of the population, in the revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the proletariat and its party, it is impossible for the revolution to achieve victory. Therefore, the foundation of the united front is the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the proletariat. The historical experience of the Chinese revolution and revolutions in other countries has proven that whenever leadership over the peasants is strengthened and the alliance between the proletariat and the peasants is consolidated, the revolution develops smoothly; conversely, it suffers setbacks. Feudalism is the ally of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism and the foundation of their rule, and it is the direct oppressor and exploiter of the peasants. Therefore, to consolidate its alliance with the peasants, the proletariat must lead the peasants and fully mobilize the masses to fight against the feudal class by their own efforts. During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to establish an anti-Japanese united front with the Kuomintang and unite those who could still oppose imperialism, our Party adopted the policy of reducing rent and interest, thereby alleviating the burden on the peasants. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, we led the peasants to implement a thorough reform of the land system, meeting the peasants' land demands. In this way, we won over the broad masses of peasants to resolutely participate in the revolutionary struggle, becoming the most solid allies of the proletariat, and creating the most basic conditions for defeating the Kuomintang reactionaries. It was precisely because the proletariat and its party strengthened their leadership over the peasants, and the worker-peasant alliance formed as a result, that not only was the revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capital victorious, but also the New Democratic Revolution smoothly transformed into the socialist revolution.

    The national bourgeoisie of China can become a force for the revolution to a certain extent and for a certain period. Therefore, it is essential to manage the united front between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie well. Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the Chinese Communist Party's united front policy towards the bourgeoisie as a policy of "unity and struggle." He said, "An important part of the Chinese Communist Party's political line is the political line of uniting with the bourgeoisie while struggling against it." The reason for the need for both unity and struggle is that the national bourgeoisie in this semi-colonial China has both revolutionary and wavering, compromising aspects. In the history of the Chinese revolution, both "left" and right tendencies have occurred in the united front policy. "Left" opportunists could not see the dual nature of the Chinese bourgeoisie, advocated "all struggle," and denied the possibility and necessity of unity; right opportunists also could not see the dual nature of the Chinese bourgeoisie, advocated "all unity," and denied the necessity of struggle. Comrade Mao Zedong's correct policy developed in the struggle between the two lines against right and "left" opportunism. The policy of unity and struggle in the united front has different contents in different periods of the revolution. For example, during the Anti-Japanese War, the united front also included the big bourgeoisie represented by Chiang Kai-shek. At this time, the Party's united front policy towards the Kuomintang big bourgeoisie was aimed at its dual policy of resisting Japan while preparing to surrender, and uniting with the Communists while opposing them, and the struggle was conducted in a reasonable, advantageous, and restrained manner under the premise of adhering to "independence and autonomy." After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the big bourgeoisie launched a full-scale civil war, and they completely became the enemy of the people, while the national bourgeoisie remained within the united front. At this time, the Party's policy of unity and struggle in the united front was manifested in the policy of unity towards the bourgeoisie's revolutionary possibilities, and the policy of criticism towards its wavering and compromising nature. The struggle with the national bourgeoisie was also different from the past struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries, because the national bourgeoisie was not the ruling power; but in general, it was also a policy of unity and struggle. This policy was to eliminate the political influence of the bourgeoisie among the people and promote the national bourgeoisie to oppose imperialism and domestic reactionaries, striving for the complete victory of the revolution. Our experience has proven that in the united front work, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of clearly distinguishing between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and to draw clear class boundaries in terms of program, policy, ideology, and practice, to ensure the leadership of the proletariat in the united front, and to ensure the political, ideological, and organizational purity of the Communist Party. Only in this way can the revolution be carried through to the end, otherwise it will be abandoned halfway. It was precisely because Comrade Mao Zedong adhered to the policy of unity and struggle in the united front, won over and strengthened the middle forces, and won over all classes except the feudal landlords and bureaucratic bourgeoisie to participate in the struggle against the US-Chiang reactionary forces, that US imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek were extremely isolated. During this period, the Party's united front developed into an unprecedentedly broad and unprecedentedly consolidated new stage. Without such a broad united front and without the Party's firm revolutionary policy, it would have been impossible to defeat the aggressive forces of US imperialism and the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek.

    Although the Party's policy of unity and struggle in the united front has different contents in different revolutionary periods, its fundamental purpose is to realize the strategic tasks of the revolution in various periods, and it serves the overall strategic goal of the revolution. The united front policy is a revolutionary policy, a special form of class struggle under China's specific conditions, and it has nothing in common with the arguments of class reconciliation and the cancellation of class struggle. In the united front, it is necessary to ensure the leadership of the proletariat and not to cede the leadership to any bourgeois political party. Only when the proletariat firmly grasps the leadership of the revolution through the Communist Party can it be guaranteed that the revolution will be carried through to the end. In the history of the Chinese revolution, right opportunists, such as Chen Duxiu, who advocated "all work to the Kuomintang" during the First Revolutionary Civil War, and Wang Ming, who advocated "everything through the united front, everything subordinate to the united front" during the Anti-Japanese War, were essentially opposed to the revolution and the leadership of the Party. The historical experience of the Chinese revolution proves that when the proletariat splits with the bourgeoisie, the Party must focus on opposing the "left" closing-door tendency; when the proletariat cooperates with the bourgeoisie, the Party must focus on opposing the right opportunist tendency.

    The historical experience of the Chinese revolution proves that in order to oppose imperialism and overthrow domestic reactionary forces, not only is a broad domestic united front needed, but also a broad international united front is needed. In May 1960, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in a conversation with friends from delegations of Iraq, Iran, Cyprus, and other countries: "In order to defeat the reactionary rule of imperialism, it is necessary to form a broad united front, to unite all forces that can be united, excluding the enemy, and to continue the arduous struggle." Today, imperialism, headed by the United States, is the common enemy of the people of the world. Imperialism not only exploits and oppresses its own people, but also enslaves and plunders the people in other countries. Therefore, in the struggle against imperialism and its running dogs, the people of the world need to unite and support each other. Only by combining the struggles of the people of socialist countries, the national liberation struggles of the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries, the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat in capitalist countries, and the struggles of the people of all countries for peace, and forming a powerful anti-imperialist front, can we defeat imperialism and its running dogs, achieve lasting world peace, and develop the cause of human progress.

    (III) On the question of Party building. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The united front and armed struggle are the two basic weapons for defeating the enemy. The united front is a united front for carrying out armed struggle. The Party organization is the valiant warrior who wields these two weapons to charge against the enemy. This is the interrelationship among the three." The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the Chinese revolution. Without the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it would have been impossible to achieve the victory of the Chinese proletarian revolution. The historical experience of the Chinese revolution proves that the more the Party's construction is strengthened, the more rapidly the revolution develops; and the more rapidly the revolution develops, the more necessary it is to strengthen the Party's construction. This has become a law.

    Comrade Mao Zedong has always attached importance to strengthening the Party's leading role and strengthening the work of Party building. As early as during the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Mao Zedong called the issue of Party building one of the three magic weapons of the revolution, proposing to build a "Bolshevized Chinese Communist Party that is nationally based, broad-mass-based, and fully consolidated ideologically, politically, and organizationally," and stipulated specific measures to strengthen Party building. The Party's rectification movement in 1942 was a large-scale Party building work of great historical significance. After this rectification, the Party's ideological level was unprecedentedly enhanced, and the Party's organization was unprecedentedly consolidated, preparing ideological, political, and organizational conditions for achieving national victory. Therefore, after the surrender of Japanese imperialism, the Party was able to lead the people to smash the counter-revolutionary war launched by US imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek in a relatively short period of time, and achieved the victory of the national revolution.

    On the eve of the national revolutionary victory, according to the development of the situation, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward new tasks on the issue of Party building. Especially in implementing the Party's principle of democratic centralism, Comrade Mao Zedong further made scientific provisions based on the principles of Leninism and the experience of the Party's long-term struggle. The instructions on the issue of Party building put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong in the "Instructions on Establishing a Reporting System" drafted by the Party Central Committee in January 1948, "Land Reform Work and Party Rectification Work in 1948," and the "Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the September Conference" were new developments in implementing democratic centralism under new conditions, and played a significant role in overcoming certain undisciplined, anarchic states and certain localist, guerrilla tendencies brought about by the long-term guerrilla warfare environment and rural environment at that time. Within our Party, a fine tradition has long been formed in which major issues are decided by the Party collectively rather than by individuals. The "Decision on Improving the Party Committee System" drafted by Comrade Mao Zedong for the Party Central Committee in September 1948 summarized the experience of the Party's collective leadership and expanded the scope of implementing collective leadership, playing a significant role in strengthening the Party's collective leadership. This decision has been universally implemented throughout the Party and remains a fundamental system of our Party to this day. The article "Methods of Work of Party Committees" written by Comrade Mao Zedong in 1949 further made scientific provisions on the work style and work methods of Party committees. These have added new content to the Leninist theory of Party building. In studying Lenin's theory of Party building and Comrade Mao Zedong's works, we deeply realize that the Party's leadership is absolute, holistic, comprehensive, indivisible, unshakable, and without exception. Any weakening of the Party's role is a weakening of the cause of revolution and construction.

    Comrade Mao Zedong has consistently adhered to the use of Marxist-Leninist theory to educate the entire Party and educate cadres, constantly improving the political and ideological theoretical level of the entire Party. The experience of the Chinese revolution proves that a political party that guides a great revolutionary movement cannot achieve victory without revolutionary theory. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, our Party has cultivated a large number of revolutionary backbones with Marxist-Leninist theoretical cultivation and practical struggle experience, greatly improving our Party's combat effectiveness and accelerating the victory of the revolution. Because our Party has consistently adhered to the principle of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and constantly opposed various forms of opportunism, opposed dogmatism and empiricism, it has safeguarded the purity of Marxism-Leninism, continuously strengthened the theoretical position of Marxism-Leninism, and closely combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and achieved creative development. The entire Party's serious principle spirit of pursuing truth, adhering to truth, and fighting for truth, and the lively and original flexible spirit of respecting practice, respecting mass creation, and respecting fresh things have been universally promoted.

    Our Party has always attached importance to criticism and self-criticism, which has become a fine traditional style of our Party. Because of adhering to criticism and self-criticism, our Party has been able to sum up beneficial experiences from successes and failures, and seek continuous progress. A Party with this style is an important guarantee for leading the Chinese revolution from victory to victory.

    Marxism has always held that history is created by the people. The more the people's awareness, enthusiasm, and creativity are enhanced, the more the revolutionary cause develops. The fact that the Chinese revolutionary cause has developed so rapidly is not only inextricably linked to the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's correct strategic and tactical thinking, but also inextricably linked to the fine style that has been established within our Party due to Comrade Mao Zedong's advocacy, especially the mass line style. During the Third Revolutionary Civil War, Comrade Mao Zedong personally wrote the "Instructions of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on Re-promulgating the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention," "The Democratic Movement Within the Army," "Comments on the Great Victory in Northwest China and Discussion on the New-Style Military Rectification Movement of the Liberation Army," "Talk to the Editorial Staff of the Jin-Sui Daily," and "Methods of Work of Party Committees," and once again made new contributions to the Party's mass line. It is precisely because the Party's mass line style has been continuously promoted that our Party has formed a flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses. Therefore, under any difficult and arduous conditions, we can rely on the strength of the masses to defeat the enemy and achieve the victory of the revolution.

    (III)

    In a large country like China, overthrowing the counter-revolutionary forces and seizing revolutionary power is an extremely great victory for the proletarian revolution. However, as Lenin said, for the proletariat, seizing revolutionary power is not the end of the revolution, but merely the beginning of the revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The entire Chinese revolutionary movement led by the Chinese Communist Party is a complete revolutionary movement that includes two stages: the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution; these are two revolutionary processes of different natures, and it is only possible to complete the latter revolutionary process after completing the former revolutionary process. The democratic revolution is a necessary preparation for the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the inevitable trend of the democratic revolution." It is precisely with this thought of combining the Marxist-Leninist theory of continuous revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development that Comrade Mao Zedong guided the Chinese revolution, so that the Chinese revolution continuously moved from one victory to another. On the eve of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong timely pointed out the new tasks after the proletariat seized power. In the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and in the work "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," he comprehensively and profoundly summarized the experience of the Chinese revolution, analyzed the domestic political and economic situation, and proposed various guidelines for promoting the rapid achievement of national victory and organizing this victory; he stipulated the basic policies that the Party should adopt in all aspects of politics, economy, and diplomacy after the national victory; and timely proposed the path for China to transform from an agricultural country to an industrial country and from a new democratic society to a socialist society. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that after the revolution achieved national victory and solved the land problem, there were still two basic contradictions in China, namely the contradiction between China's working class and China's bourgeoisie; and the contradiction between China and imperialist countries. Comrade Mao Zedong particularly focused on analyzing the status of various economic components in China at that time and the series of policies that the Party must adopt, pointing out the methods for China to realize socialist transformation, criticizing various "left" and right deviations on this issue; and affirming that China's economic development would have a relatively high speed. Comrade Mao Zedong estimated the new situation of domestic and international class struggles after the national revolutionary victory, timely pointed out that after the enemies with guns were eliminated, the enemies without guns still existed, and the remaining domestic enemies and the reactionary forces of imperialism must not be underestimated; pointed out that in the historical period when classes had not been eliminated domestically and the imperialist system existed in the world, the People's Liberation Army would always be a fighting team; and timely warned that the "sugar-coated bullets" of the bourgeoisie would become the main danger to the proletariat, and put forward important instructions to oppose the possible emergence of arrogance, complacency, stagnation, and the desire for enjoyment and unwillingness to live a hard life within the Party. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, and the work is greater and more arduous. ... It is imperative to ensure that comrades continue to maintain the style of being modest, prudent, not arrogant, and not impatient, and that comrades continue to maintain the style of hard struggle. ... We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." All Party comrades, in accordance with the direction of continuous revolution indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong, led the people of the whole country, under the guidance of the general line of the democratic revolution and the general line of the socialist revolution put forward by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and achieved a complete victory in the democratic revolution and a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the economic front and the political-ideological front. In socialist construction, after the economic recovery and development after liberation, and after the construction of the first five-year plan, especially under the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, a three-year continuous great leap forward was realized, and a brand-new face appeared in the country in terms of politics, economy, and people's thinking. At present, the entire Party and the people of the whole country are working hard to build a great socialist power with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. We firmly believe that this brilliant prospect will soon become a beautiful reality.

    The fact that the Chinese revolution and construction cause has achieved great achievements further confirms the correctness of Lenin's following principles: When Lenin spoke of the relationship between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, he pointed out: "The former revolution can be transformed into the latter revolution. The latter revolution can solve the problems of the former revolution by the way. The latter revolution can consolidate the cause of the former revolution. Only struggle, struggle, can determine to what extent the latter revolution can exceed the former revolution." China's experience shows that the more thorough and extensive the democratic revolution is, the more rapidly the socialist revolution will proceed; and the more thorough and rapid the socialist revolution proceeds, the more rapid and smooth socialist construction will proceed. At the same time, accelerating socialist construction is also preparing conditions for the transition to communism and promoting the early realization of communism. In the revolutionary process, the previous stage must prepare conditions for the next stage, and in the next stage, some revolutionary tasks that were not completed in the previous stage must continue to be completed. The two have both differences and connections. While carrying out the socialist revolution in terms of social system, it is also necessary to carry out the socialist revolution on the political-ideological front. The two are combined with each other and promote each other. After the proletariat seizes power, while carrying out the socialist revolution, it is necessary to carry out socialist construction; and in the process of socialist construction, it is necessary to continuously carry out the socialist revolution, and continuously solve the contradictions that arise in socialist construction between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base, in order to adapt to the development of productive forces. In short, it is wrong not to regard the various revolutionary stages as interconnected and continuously developing processes, and to stop at the existing stage. At the same time, it is also wrong to confuse the qualitative differences between the various revolutionary stages and to think that certain processes of historical development can be overstepped. Only by strictly following the dialectical unity of the Marxist-Leninist theory of continuous revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development can the revolution and construction continuously achieve victory.

    (IV)

    Comrade Mao Zedong's writings are filled from beginning to end with the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. This thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat is the essence of Comrade Mao Zedong's writings, and this spirit is precisely the soul of Marxism-Leninism. The fundamental characteristic of all right opportunists is to advocate class reconciliation and oppose revolution. As Lenin said, opportunists always castrate the revolutionary content of Marxist doctrine, "blunt its revolutionary edge, and vulgarize it." "They forget, obliterate, and distort the revolutionary aspect and revolutionary spirit of this doctrine, and put what the bourgeoisie can accept or seems to be able to accept in the first place and praise it." Whether or not to have a revolution, whether or not to have a thorough revolution, is the watershed between Marxism-Leninism and right opportunism.

    The reason why Comrade Mao Zedong became a great Leninist-style thorough proletarian revolutionary is linked to his firm dialectical materialist and historical materialist worldview. In Comrade Mao Zedong's writings, it is always connected by a thought, and this thought is the proletarian revolutionary worldview, which is the Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoint, and method. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "There are two kinds of worldviews and methodologies: the proletarian worldview and methodology and the bourgeois worldview and methodology." Some comrades "... often hold the bourgeois worldview and methodology in their hands; while the proletarian worldview and methodology are often left behind." It is precisely because Comrade Mao Zedong firmly used the proletarian worldview and methodology to observe the situation, study, and guide the Chinese revolutionary movement that he was always able to see the essence and development prospects of things. When the sky seemed to be full of dark clouds, he could see the red sun about to burst forth. In the long night, he could point out the road to dawn for the people. In the complex environment, he can point out the correct direction for the people, thus guiding the Chinese people to continuously move from victory to victory. In the history of our Party, all right and "left" opportunism, in the final analysis, are reflections of the bourgeois worldview and the petty-bourgeois worldview within the Party. The struggle between the correct line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong and various opportunist lines is essentially the struggle between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview. The victory of the Chinese revolution throughout the country is the victory of the Party's correct line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, and the victory of the Marxist-Leninist worldview. If we understand this point, we will be able to fundamentally understand why Comrade Mao Zedong has always stood higher, seen farther, and more deeply than others in our Party, and why Comrade Mao Zedong has always been able to maintain his firm and thorough revolutionary spirit. In studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, we should pay special attention to studying Comrade Mao Zedong's proletarian worldview, respecting materialism, and respecting dialectics, so as to be a conscious and thorough revolutionary fighter.

    Let us hold even higher the banner of invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely advance on the road to victory towards a more beautiful future.

    必须把革命进行到底
    ——读《毛泽东选集》第四卷的体会
    欧阳钦
    （续昨）
    （二）关于统一战线问题。毛泽东同志说：“中国新民主主义的革命要胜利，没有一个包括全民族绝大多数人口的最广泛的统一战线，是不可能的。不但如此，这个统一战线还必须是在中国共产党的坚强的领导之下。没有中国共产党的坚强的领导，任何革命统一战线也是不能胜利的。”?统一战线的实质，正像毛泽东同志所指出的：是为了发展进步势力，广泛地争取同盟军，团结一切可以团结的人，最大限度地孤立敌人，从而取得革命的胜利。
    毛泽东同志根据中国革命的经验，发展了马克思列宁主义的学说，形成了一整套关于革命统一战线的完整的正确的政策。毛泽东同志指出，中国的无产阶级、农民阶级与其它小资产阶级，是革命的基本动力，无产阶级是革命的领导力量，农民是无产阶级坚固的同盟军。没有在无产阶级及其政党领导下的占人口绝大多数的农民参加革命斗争，革命要取得胜利是不可能的。因此统一战线的基础是无产阶级领导下的工农联盟。中国革命和各国革命的历史经验都证明：凡是加强了对农民的领导，巩固了无产阶级和农民的联盟，革命就得到顺利的发展，反之就会遭到失败。封建主义是帝国主义和官僚资本主义的同盟者及其统治的基础，是农民的直接压迫者和剥削者，因此，无产阶级为巩固同农民的联盟必须领导农民，充分放手发动群众，由群众自己动手向封建阶级作斗争。在抗日战争时期，为了同国民党建立抗日统一战线和团结当时尚能反对帝国主义的人们，我们党采取了减租减息的政策，减轻了农民的负担；抗日战争结束以后，我们就领导农民实行了土地制度的彻底改革，满足了农民的土地要求。这样，我们就争取了广大的农民坚决参加到革命的斗争中来，成为无产阶级的最坚固的同盟军，为战胜国民党反动派创造了最基本的条件。正是由于无产阶级及其政党加强了对农民的领导，以及由此形成的工农联盟，因而不仅使反对帝国主义反对封建主义反对官僚资本的革命取得了胜利，又使新民主主义革命顺利地转变为社会主义革命。
    中国的民族资产阶级在一定时期中和一定程度上，可以成为革命的一种力量。因此，搞好无产阶级同资产阶级的统一战线是十分必要的。毛泽东同志把中国共产党同资产阶级的统一战线政策概括为“又联合又斗争”的政策。他说：“中国共产党的政治路线的重要一部分，就是同资产阶级联合又同它斗争的政治路线。”?其所以需要又联合又斗争，原因在于中国这个半殖民地的民族资产阶级有革命的和动摇妥协的两面性。在中国革命历史上，在统一战线政策上曾经发生过“左”的和右的两种倾向。“左”倾关门主义者看不见中国资产阶级的两面性，主张“一切斗争”，否认联合的可能性和必要性；右倾机会主义者也看不见中国资产阶级的两面性，主张“一切联合”，否认斗争的必要性。毛泽东同志的正确政策，就是在同右的和“左”的机会主义进行两条路线的斗争中发展起来的。统一战线的又联合又斗争的政策在革命的不同时期有不同的内容，如在抗日战争时期统一战线内也包括了蒋介石所代表的大资产阶级，这时党的统一战线政策对于国民党大资产阶级来说，就是针对着它又抗日又准备投降、又联共又反共的两面政策，在坚持“独立自主”的前提下进行有理、有利、有节的斗争。在抗日战争胜利以后，大资产阶级发动了全面内战，他们完全成了人民的敌人，而民族资产阶级则留在统一战线内部。这时党的又联合又斗争的统一战线政策表现在对资产阶级的革命可能性上，是联合政策；对于它的动摇性和妥协性上，是批评的政策。和民族资产阶级的斗争同过去对国民党反动派的斗争形式也有区别，因为民族资产阶级不是当权派；但总的说来，这也是一种又联合又斗争的政策。这个政策是要在人民群众中肃清资产阶级的政治影响和推动民族资产阶级反对帝国主义和国内反动派，争取革命彻底胜利。我们的经验证明：在统一战线工作中，必须坚持划清无产阶级和资产阶级之间的原则区别，在纲领、政策、思想、实践等各方面都要划清阶级界限，保证无产阶级在统一战线中的领导权，保证共产党在政治上、思想上和组织上的纯洁性。这样，才能把革命进行到底，否则就会半途而废。正是由于毛泽东同志坚持了统一战线的又联合又斗争的政策，争取和坚定了中间派，争取了除封建地主和官僚资产阶级以外的各个阶层都参加到反对美蒋反动势力的斗争中来，极大地孤立了美帝国主义和蒋介石。这个时期，党的统一战线发展到了一个空前广泛和空前巩固的新阶段，没有这样广泛的统一战线，没有党的坚定的革命方针，要打倒美帝国主义的侵略势力和蒋介石的反动统治是不可能的。
    党的统一战线的又联合又斗争的政策尽管在各个革命时期有不同的内容，但其根本目的都是为了实现各个时期革命的战略任务，都是为了革命的总的战略目的服务的。统一战线政策是革命的政策，是在我国具体条件下，阶级斗争的一种特殊形式，它同阶级调和、取消阶级斗争的论点毫无共同之处。在统一战线中必须保证无产阶级的领导权，而不能把领导权让给任何资产阶级的政党。只有无产阶级经过共产党紧紧掌握革命的领导权，才能保证把革命进行到底。中国革命历史上右倾机会主义者例如第一次国内革命战争时期的陈独秀所主张的“一切工作归国民党”，抗日战争时期王明所主张的“一切通过统一战线，一切服从统一战线”等，其实质都是不要革命，不要党的领导。中国革命的历史经验证明，当着无产阶级同资产阶级分裂的时候，党必须着重反对“左”倾关门主义的偏向；当着无产阶级同资产阶级合作的时候，党必须着重反对右倾机会主义的偏向。
    中国革命的历史经验证明，为了反对帝国主义，为了打倒国内的反动势力，不仅需要国内的广泛的统一战线，而且需要国际上的广泛的统一战线。1960年5月毛泽东同志在同伊拉克、伊朗、塞浦路斯等代表团的朋友们的谈话中指出：“为了战胜帝国主义的反动统治，必须结成广泛的统一战线，必须团结不包括敌人在内的一切可以团结的力量，继续进行艰巨的斗争。”在今天，以美国为首的帝国主义，是全世界人民的共同敌人。帝国主义不仅剥削、压迫本国人民，而且奴役和掠夺其它国家的人民。因此在反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中，全世界人民需要互相团结，互相支持，只有把社会主义各国人民的斗争、殖民地半殖民地人民的民族解放斗争、资本主义各国无产阶级的革命斗争、各国人民争取和平的斗争结合在一起，组成强大的反帝国主义的战线，才能击败帝国主义及其走狗，取得世界的持久和平，发展人类进步的事业。
    （三）关于党的建设问题。毛泽东同志说：“统一战线和武装斗争是战胜敌人的两个基本武器。统一战线，是实行武装斗争的统一战线。而党的组织，则是掌握统一战线和武装斗争这两个武器以实行对敌冲锋陷阵的英勇战士。这就是三者的相互关系。”?党的领导是中国革命胜利的根本保证，没有中国共产党的英明领导，是不可能取得中国无产阶级革命的胜利的。中国革命的历史经验证明：党的建设越加强，革命发展就越迅速，革命发展的越迅速，越要加强党的建设。这已经成了一条定律。
    毛泽东同志一向重视加强党的领导作用并加强党的建设工作。还在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志就把党的建设问题称为革命的三大法宝之一，提出要建设一个“全国范围的、广大群众性的、思想上政治上组织上完全巩固的布尔塞维克化的中国共产党”?，并规定了加强党的建设的具体措施。1942年党的整风运动，是一次具有伟大历史意义的大规模的党的建设工作。经过这次整风，党的思想水平空前提高，党的组织空前巩固，为取得全国的胜利准备了思想上、政治上、组织上的条件，因而在日本帝国主义投降以后，党能够领导人民在较短的时间内粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石所发动的反革命战争，取得了全国革命的胜利。
    在全国革命胜利的前夕，根据形势的发展，毛泽东同志在党的建设问题上又提出了新的任务，特别是在贯彻党的民主集中制原则上，毛泽东同志根据列宁主义原理和党的长期斗争的经验进一步作出了科学的规定。毛泽东同志在1948年1月为党中央起草的《关于建立报告制度》的指示和《1948年的土地改革工作和整党工作》以及《中共中央关于九月会议的通知》等文件中所提出的关于党的建设问题的指示，就是在新的条件下贯彻民主集中制的新的发展，对于克服当时由于长期处在被敌人分割的游击战争环境和农村环境而带来的某些无纪律、无政府状态和某些地方主义、游击主义倾向起了重大作用。在我们党内，长期以来，由党的集体而不是由个人决定重大问题已经形成一个优良的传统。毛泽东同志在1948年9月为党中央起草的《关于健全党委制》的决定总结了党的集体领导的经验，并且扩大了实行集体领导的范围，对于加强党的集体领导起了重大作用。这个决定在全党普遍实行了，并且一直到现在仍然是我们党的一个根本制度。毛泽东同志在1949年所写的《党委会的工作方法》一文，对党委会的工作作风、工作方法等进一步作了科学的规定。这些都为列宁主义的建党学说增添了新的内容。我们在学习列宁建党学说和毛泽东同志的著作中，使我们深切体会到：党的领导是绝对的、整体的、全面的、不可分割的、不能动摇的、没有例外的。对党的作用的任何削弱，都是对革命和建设事业的削弱。
    毛泽东同志一贯坚持用马克思列宁主义理论教育全党，教育干部，不断地提高全党的政治思想理论水平。中国革命经验证明：指导一个伟大的革命运动的政党，如果没有革命理论，要取得胜利是不可能的。在毛泽东思想的指导下，我们党培养出了大批的有马克思列宁主义理论修养并有实际斗争经验的革命骨干，大大地提高了我们党的战斗力，加速了革命的胜利。由于我们党一贯地坚持马克思列宁主义普遍真理和中国革命具体实践相结合的方针，不断地反对各种机会主义，反对教条主义和经验主义，因而保卫了马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，使马克思列宁主义的理论阵地得到了不断的加强，使马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命与建设的具体实践密切地结合了起来，并得到创造性的发展。全党追求真理、坚持真理、为真理奋斗的严肃的原则精神，同尊重实践、尊重群众创造、尊重新鲜事物的生动独创的灵活精神，得到了普遍的发扬。
    我们党一向重视批评与自我批评，这已经成为我们党的一个优良的传统作风。由于坚持了批评和自我批评，所以我们党能够在成功和失败中总结出有益的经验，求得不断的进步。具有这种作风的党乃是领导中国革命从胜利走向胜利的重要保证。
    马克思主义向来认为，历史是人民群众创造的。人民群众的觉悟、积极性、创造性愈提高，革命事业就愈发展。中国革命事业发展得如此迅速，不仅与毛泽东同志的正确的战略策略思想指导有密不可分的联系，而且与由于毛泽东同志的提倡在我们党内树立起来的优良作风，特别是群众路线的作风，有密不可分的联系。在第三次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志亲手写的《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》，《军队内部的民主运动》，《评西北大捷兼论解放军的新式整军运动》，《对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话》，以及《党委会的工作方法》等，又一次对党的群众路线作出了新的建树。正是由于党的群众路线的作风不断地得到发扬，我们党才与群众结成了血肉的联系，因而在任何艰难困苦的条件下，我们都能依靠群众的力量战胜敌人，取得革命的胜利。
    （三）
    在中国这样一个大的国家打倒了反革命势力，取得了革命政权，这是无产阶级革命的一个极其伟大的胜利。但是，正如列宁所说，对于无产阶级来说，取得革命政权并不是革命的终结，仅仅是革命的开始。毛泽东同志说：“中国共产党领导的整个中国革命运动，是包括民主主义革命和社会主义革命两个阶段在内的全部革命运动；这是两个性质不同的革命过程，只有完成了前一个革命过程才有可能去完成后一个革命过程。民主主义革命是社会主义革命的必要准备，社会主义革命是民主主义革命的必然趋势。”?毛泽东同志正是以这种马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的思想指导中国革命，因而使中国革命由一个胜利不间断地走上另一个胜利。在1949年中华人民共和国成立的前夕，毛泽东同志就及时地指出了无产阶级夺取政权后的新任务。他在党的七届二中全会上，和在《论人民民主专政》的著作中，全面深刻地总结了中国革命的经验，分析了国内的政治经济形势，提出了促进革命迅速取得全国胜利和组织这个胜利的各项方针；规定了党在全国胜利以后，在政治、经济、外交等各方面应当采取的基本政策；及时地提出了使中国由农业国转变为工业国、由新民主主义社会转变为社会主义社会的途径。毛泽东同志指出：革命在全国胜利和解决了土地问题以后，中国还存在两种基本的矛盾，即中国工人阶级和中国资产阶级的矛盾；中国和帝国主义国家的矛盾。毛泽东同志特别着重地分析了当时中国经济各种成分的状况和党必须采取的一系列政策，指出中国实现社会主义改造的方法，批判了在这个问题上的各种“左”的和右的偏向；并且确认中国的经济发展将有较高的速度。毛泽东同志估计了全国革命胜利后的国内外阶级斗争的新形势，及时指出，在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，决不可轻视国内残余敌人和帝国主义的反动势力；指出在国内没有消灭阶级和世界上存在着帝国主义制度的历史时期内，人民解放军永远是一个战斗队；及时警告资产阶级的“糖衣炮弹”将成为对无产阶级的主要危险，提出反对党内可能出现的骄傲情绪、功臣自居情绪、停顿起来不求进步的情绪、贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪等等重要的指示。毛泽东同志说：“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。……务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。……我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”?全党同志正是按照毛泽东同志所指示的不断革命的方向，领导全国人民，在党和毛泽东同志提出的民主革命总路线和社会主义革命总路线的指导下，在全国范围内取得了民主革命的彻底胜利和社会主义革命在经济战线、政治思想战线上的决定性的胜利。在社会主义建设上，经过解放后的经济恢复和发展，经过第一个五年计划的建设，特别是在党的社会主义建设总路线的指导下，实现了三年的连续大跃进，全国在政治上、经济上和人们的思想上都出现了崭新的面貌。现在，全党和全国人民正在为建设一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国而艰苦奋斗。我们深信，这个光辉的前景，用不了多久，就会变成美好的现实。
    中国革命和建设事业取得伟大成就的事实更加证实了列宁如下原理的正确性：列宁在说到民主革命与社会主义革命的关系时指出：“前一革命可以转变为后一革命。后一革命可以顺便解决前一革命的问题。后一革命可以巩固前一革命的事业。斗争，只有斗争，才能决定后一革命能够超过前一革命到什么程度。”?中国的经验表明：民主革命进行得越彻底、越广泛，则社会主义革命进行得越迅速；而社会主义革命进行得越彻底、越迅速，社会主义建设也就进行得越迅速、越顺利。同时，加速社会主义建设，也就是为过渡到共产主义准备条件，促进共产主义的早日实现。在革命进程中前一阶段就要为后一阶段准备条件，在后一阶段要继续完成前一阶段所未完成的某些革命任务。二者互有区别又互有联系。在进行社会制度方面的社会主义革命的同时还要进行政治思想战线上的社会主义革命。二者互相结合、又互相推动。在无产阶级取得政权以后，在进行社会主义革命的同时，就要进行社会主义建设；而在社会主义建设过程中又要不断地进行社会主义革命，不断地解决在社会主义建设中出现的生产关系同生产力之间的矛盾，上层建筑同经济基础之间的矛盾，以适应生产力的发展。总之，不把各个革命阶段看作是互有联系的、不断发展的过程，在现存的阶段上停顿不前，是错误的。同时，混淆各个革命阶段互有质的区别，认为可以逾越历史发展的一定过程，也是错误的。只有严格地遵循马克思列宁主义不断革命论和革命发展阶段论辩证统一的原理，才能使革命和建设不断地取得胜利。
    （四）
    在毛泽东同志的著作里，从始至终都充满着无产阶级的彻底革命精神。这种无产阶级的彻底革命精神，是毛泽东同志著作中的精华，这种精神正是马克思列宁主义的灵魂。一切右倾机会主义者的根本特点都是主张阶级调和，不要革命。正如列宁所说，机会主义者总是阉割马克思主义学说的革命内容，“磨灭它的革命锋芒，把它庸俗化。”“他们遗忘、抹杀和歪曲这个学说的革命方面和革命精神，把资产阶级可以接受或者似乎可以接受的东西放在第一位来加以颂扬。”?要不要革命，要不要彻底革命，乃是马克思列宁主义和右倾机会主义的分水岭。
    毛泽东同志所以成为伟大的列宁式的无产阶级的彻底革命家，是和他的坚定的辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的世界观联系在一起的。在毛泽东同志的著作中始终都是由一个思想贯串起来的，这个思想就是无产阶级的革命世界观，就是马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法。毛泽东同志说：“有两种世界观、方法论：无产阶级的世界观、方法论和资产阶级的世界观、方法论。”有些同志“……把资产阶级的世界观、方法论，经常拿在手里；无产阶级的世界观、方法论，却经常丢在脑后。”?毛泽东同志正是坚定地用无产阶级的世界观和方法论观察形势、研究和指导中国的革命运动的，因此他总是能看到事物的本质和发展前途，在天空似乎充满了乌云的时候，他能看出喷薄欲出的红日，在漫漫的长夜中，他能为人们指出走向黎明的道路，在扑朔迷离的复杂环境中，他能为人们指出正确的方向，因而引导了中国人民不断地从胜利走向胜利。在我们党的历史上，一切右的和“左”的机会主义，归根结底，都是资产阶级世界观和小资产阶级世界观在党内的反映。以毛泽东同志为代表的正确路线与各种机会主义路线之间的斗争，实质上是无产阶级世界观与资产阶级世界观之间的斗争。中国革命在全国的胜利，是以毛泽东同志为代表的党的正确路线的胜利，是马克思列宁主义世界观的胜利。我们懂得了这一点，我们就能够从根本上懂得为什么毛泽东同志历来在我们党内总是比别人站得更高，看得更远、更深，为什么毛泽东同志总是能够保持自己坚定的彻底的革命精神。我们学习毛泽东同志的著作，正是应当特别注意学习毛泽东同志的无产阶级的世界观，尊重唯物论，尊重辩证法，从而作一个自觉的彻底的革命战士。
    让我们更高地举起战无不胜的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的旗帜，在胜利的道路上，向更美好的前景奋勇前进。
