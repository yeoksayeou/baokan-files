Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th dispatch: As the Japanese public strongly demands that the Ikeda Cabinet resign to take responsibility for the fascist thugs' murder of Asanuma, and decides to launch a series of massive national protest movements, the Ikeda government is actually attempting to use the resignation of a minister to ease public anger and quell the Japanese people's struggle.

According to a report by Japan Broadcasting Corporation, the Ikeda government held a cabinet meeting today and decided that the Minister of Autonomy and Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission, Iwa Yamasaki, should resign to take responsibility for the Asanuma assassination incident in order to extricate the Ikeda Cabinet from the serious situation. Yamasaki will be replaced by Hideo Shuto, the former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the Yoshida Cabinet. He belongs to the Ikeda faction.

According to reports, the Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party are also attempting to postpone the dissolution of the Diet and the holding of general elections in order to avoid holding general elections when the situation is unfavorable to them.

    池田政府玩弄政治阴谋
    企图让自治相辞职以平息民愤
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：在日本公众强烈要求池田内阁就法西斯暴徒杀害浅沼的事件引咎辞职，并决定连续展开声势浩大的全民性抗议运动的时候，池田政府竟然企图用一个大臣辞职的办法来缓和人民的公愤，平息日本人民的斗争。
    据日本广播电台报道，池田政府今天召开内阁会议，决定自治相、国家公安委员长山崎岩就浅沼被杀害事件引咎辞职，以使池田内阁摆脱严重局面。接替山崎岩的是前吉田内阁的农林相周东英雄。他属于池田派。
    据报道，日本政府和自由民主党还企图推迟解散国会和举行大选的日期，以便避免在形势不利于它们的时候举行大选。
