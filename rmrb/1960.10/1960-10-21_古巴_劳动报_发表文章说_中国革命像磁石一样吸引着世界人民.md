The Cuban Labor Ministry's organ, "Labor News," recently published an article about the People's Republic of China. The article stated that China "is rapidly developing its economy, and China's industrialization is striding forward at an overwhelming speed. All those who visit China are deeply impressed when they return home by the work it is carrying out and the unbelievably remarkable achievements it has made. But what amazes them most is the great future that is being planned and built."

The article pointed out, "China is realizing a most profound and touching social revolution. This revolution attracts the poor people of the world like a magnet. Asia and Africa are watching China."

The article ridiculed the United States' policy of not recognizing the existence of the People's Republic of China, saying that none are so blind as those who will not see. The article pointed out that this impractical and blind attitude that attempts to ignore the existence of New China, its powerful strength, and its enormous appeal should be completely ended. The article said that Cuba set an example by deciding to recognize the People's Republic of China at the National Congress of the Cuban People.

The article said that the people of Latin America extend their hands to the great people of Sun Yat-sen and Mao Zedong. "The struggle against imperialism is the common struggle of the people of the world. In the face of a common enemy, we should all unite. Our unity will guarantee our victory."

    古巴“劳动报”发表文章说
    中国革命像磁石一样吸引着世界人民
    古巴劳工部机关刊“劳动报”不久前发表了一篇关于中华人民共和国的文章，文章说，中国“正在迅速地发展经济，中国的工业化正在以压倒一切的速度阔步前进。所有访问中国的人当他们回国时都非常敬佩它所进行的工作和所取得的令人难以相信的成就。但是，最使他们惊叹的是正在筹划和建造的伟大的未来。”
    文章指出，“中国正在实现着一次最深刻最感动人心的社会革命。这个革命像一块磁石一样吸引着全世界的贫苦的人民。亚洲和非洲看着中国。”
    文章讥讽美国不承认中华人民共和国存在的政策时说，没有比不愿意看的人更眼瞎的了。文章指出，应该彻底结束这种企图无视新中国的存在、它的强大的威力和巨大吸引力的不实际和盲目的态度。文章说，古巴由于古巴人民全国大会决定承认中华人民共和国，而做出了榜样。
    文章说，拉丁美洲人民向孙中山和毛泽东的伟大人民伸出了手。“反对帝国主义的斗争是全世界人民的共同斗争。面对着共同的敌人，我们大家应该团结起来。我们的团结将保证我们的胜利。”
