Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 8th: The United Nations General Assembly held plenary sessions on the 6th and 7th to continue the general political debate.

　　Iraqi Foreign Minister Jawad spoke first at the morning session on the 6th, condemning colonialism. He pointed out that it is the inevitable path for oppressed people to achieve political independence, and for all countries that have lost their national freedom to take. Colonialist countries attempt to maintain their rule over colonial dependencies by force, which is now and will remain an important cause of international conflict.

　　Jawad used the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Algeria and the Arabian Peninsula to prove that no matter how powerful the colonialist countries are, they cannot suppress the people who are fighting for a just cause—their own liberation.

　　Jawad firmly condemned Belgium's acts of aggression in the Congo.
　　Irish Foreign Minister Aiken defended the UN Secretary-General's actions in the Congo serving the colonialist countries in his speech, and he opposed reorganizing the UN's executive bodies.
　　Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange spoke last at the morning session on the 6th. When talking about disarmament, he insisted that the technical issues of supervision must first be studied "without fanfare or publicity."
　　At the morning session on the 7th, Yemen representative Zabala spoke, condemning France's cruel colonial war in Algeria.

　　Then, Cuban Foreign Minister Roa exercised his right of reply. He pointed out that the Guatemalan representative's statement on October 5, which insisted that Cuba was preparing to take "aggressive action" against Guatemala, was slander against Cuba. Roa said that this fabricated accusation was not conceived by the Guatemalan government itself, but was manufactured by the US State Department based on the will of the "United Fruit Company."

　　At the plenary session on the afternoon of the 7th, the United Nations General Assembly discussed and approved the admission of the Federation of Nigeria as a member of the United Nations based on the Security Council's recommendation. With the addition of Nigeria, the United Nations now has ninety-nine member states.

　　Guinean President Sékou Touré, who came to attend the United Nations General Assembly, expressed his delight that two-thirds of African countries have become members of the United Nations. Sékou Touré also pointed out that the issue of sovereignty remains an urgent issue in many newly independent African countries.

　　Sékou Touré also talked about the issue of the People's Republic of China's representation in the United Nations.
　　Nigerian Federal Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa delivered a reply at the end of the meeting. He stated that Nigeria does not want to join any bloc, and said that Nigeria hopes to "maintain friendly relations with all countries."

    联大全体会议继续一般性辩论
    据新华社8日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会6日和7日举行全体会议，继续进行一般性政治辩论。
    伊拉克外交部长贾瓦德在6日上午会议上首先发言，谴责殖民主义。他指出，被压迫人民要取得政治独立，这是一切失去民族自由的国家要走的必然道路。殖民主义国家企图用武力来保持它对殖民地附属国的统治，现在是、将来仍然是国际冲突的重要原因。
    贾瓦德以阿尔及利亚和阿拉伯半岛人民的反帝斗争证明，殖民主义国家无论怎么有力量，也镇压不了为正义事业——自己的解放而斗争的人民。
    贾瓦德坚决谴责比利时在刚果的侵略行动。
  爱尔兰外交部长埃肯在发言中为联合国秘书长在刚果为殖民主义国家效劳的行动辩护，他反对改组联合国的执行机构。
    挪威外交大臣兰格在6日上午会议上最后发言。他在谈到裁军问题时，硬说首先必须“不加标榜和宣传地”研究监督的技术问题。
    在7日上午会议上，也门代表扎巴拉发言谴责法国在阿尔及利亚进行残酷的殖民主义战争。
    接着，古巴外交部部长罗亚利用答辩权发言。他指出，危地马拉代表10月5日硬说古巴准备对危地马拉采取“侵略行动”的发言是对古巴的诽谤。罗亚说，这种无中生有的指责不是危地马拉政府自己想出来的，它是美国国务院根据“美国联合果品公司”的意旨而制造出来的。
    联合国大会在7日下午的全体会议上根据安理会的建议讨论并通过了接纳尼日利亚联邦为联合国会员国。由于尼日利亚的加入，联合国现在已有九十九个会员国。
    前来参加联合国大会会议的几内亚总统塞古·杜尔对三分之二的非洲国家成了联合国成员表示高兴。塞古·杜尔还指出，在刚刚获得独立的许多非洲国家里主权问题仍然是迫切的问题。
    塞古·杜尔还谈到了中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权问题。
    尼日利亚联邦总理阿布巴卡尔·塔法瓦·巴勒瓦在会议结束时致答词。他表示尼日利亚不想参加任何集团，并说，尼日利亚希望“同所有国家保持友好关系”。
