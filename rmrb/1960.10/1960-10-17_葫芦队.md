    Gourd Team
    Xiaobai
    These four gourds are covered with brownish-yellow river mud. They are tools invented by the militia heroes on the banks of the Yellow River during the years of the Liberation War to cross the Yellow River miraculously.
    In July 1946, the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the support of American imperialism, launched an all-out offensive against the liberated areas. The people of the liberated areas were all mobilized to actively cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to smash the enemy's frenzied offensive. The militia of Du Balian in Jiyuan County, Henan Province, who lived on the banks of the Yellow River, armed themselves with knives, spears, muskets, and stone mines. But the turbulent Yellow River blocked their advance to kill the enemy, and how urgently they needed water transportation! They said: "We are poor, we will think of poor ways, and the Milky Way cannot stop our progress." The militiamen brought into play the wisdom and creativity of the people and finally created an unprecedented river-crossing tool using local materials - the gourd team (four gourds tied together and tied to the chest can cross the Yellow River). Relying on gourds, they heroically, cleverly, and unpredictably moved along the Yellow River and attacked the enemy. The local people proudly called them the "Gourd Team".
    On September 29, 1946, three American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes became lost over Jiyuan County and anxiously looked for a place to land. They mistakenly identified the Yellow River as the Luo River. After landing, they were trapped by the silt of the Yellow River. This matter was discovered in time by the heroes of the Gourd Team. Before the enemy could call for reinforcements by radio, they immediately organized seven militiamen to ride gourds across the Yellow River and burned all three enemy planes with a fire.

    葫芦队
    晓白
    这四个葫芦上沾满着黄褐色的河泥，这是在解放战争岁月里，黄河边上的民兵英雄们发明创造的奇渡黄河的用具。
    1946年的7月，国民党反动派在美帝国主义支持下，向解放区发动了全面进攻。解放区人民全都动员起来，积极配合解放军粉碎敌人的猖狂进攻。住在黄河边上的河南济源县杜八联的民兵们用刀、矛、土枪和石雷武装起自己。但涛涛的黄河阻挡了他们杀敌的进路，他们是多么急需水上交通工具啊！他们说：“我们穷，想穷法子，天河也拦不住我们的前进。”民兵们发挥了人民的智慧和创造精神，终于就地取材，创造出自古以来从未有过的渡河工具——葫芦队（将四个葫芦扎在一起，绑在胸前就可以渡过黄河）。他们就依靠葫芦，英勇机智、神出鬼没地活动在黄河沿岸，打击敌人。当地人民骄傲地称他们为“葫芦队”。
    1946年9月29日，有三架美造蒋机，在济源县上空迷失了方向，焦急地寻找降落地方，误将黄河认做洛河，降落后，便被黄河的淤泥陷住了。这件事情被葫芦队的英雄们及时地发现了，他们不等敌人用无线电叫来援兵，就立即组织七个民兵骑着葫芦渡过黄河，一把烈火将三架敌机全部烧毁。
