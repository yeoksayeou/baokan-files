The Shanghai No. 1 and No. 3 Steel Plants Collaborate with High Style, Promoting Joint Production Leap Forward; The Two Plants' Four Open-Hearth Furnaces Jointly Enter the National Advanced Open-Hearth Furnace Ranks

(Our Shanghai dispatch, October 26) The two open-hearth furnace workshops of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant and the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, located on the east and west banks of the Huangpu River, are engaged in a heated competition of catching up with and surpassing each other. They are seriously learning from each other, selflessly helping each other, and conducting extensive collaboration like close brothers, resulting in a double leap forward in production. In September, the utilization coefficient of the two open-hearth furnaces of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant increased by 3.461 compared to the beginning of the year. Among them, No. 1 open-hearth furnace was recently rated as a "model furnace" in the city. In the first half of October, the utilization coefficient of the open-hearth furnaces of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant also approached the high-yield level of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant. Now, the four open-hearth furnaces of these two plants have jointly entered the national advanced open-hearth furnace ranks.

The competition and Great Leap Forward between these two open-hearth furnace workshops in Shanghai has never stopped. This year, after the open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant seized the national high-yield red flag for small open-hearth furnaces from the open-hearth furnace workshop of No. 3 Steel Plant, one focused on keeping the red flag, and the other on seizing the red flag, pushing the competition to a climax. Under the guidance of the idea of "everything for more steel production," the workers of the two workshops have become more enthusiastic, and the style of mutual assistance and cooperation has become higher and higher. They are both competitors and production assistants. Everyone regards the other's achievements as their own, and the other's difficulties as their own, encouraging and supporting each other in production. The workers said, "Whether the red flag is planted at the No. 1 Steel Plant's open-hearth furnace or the No. 3 Steel Plant's open-hearth furnace, it is the glory of Shanghai's steel workers. We must hold high the high-yield red flag of the national small open-hearth furnaces and ensure the victorious completion of this year's steelmaking tasks."

The open-hearth furnace workers of No. 1 Steel Plant enthusiastically hope that the open-hearth furnace workers of No. 3 Steel Plant will surpass themselves, and sincerely help the open-hearth furnace workers of No. 3 Steel Plant catch up with them. While learning from the advanced and vigorously catching up with the advanced, the open-hearth furnace workers of No. 3 Steel Plant also actively support the open-hearth furnace workers of No. 1 Steel Plant to become more advanced and "reach a new level." Since the beginning of this year, the employees of the two workshops have exchanged experiences with each other frequently. Workers from No. 1 Steel Plant have crossed the river twenty-five times to "deliver treasures" and "learn from experience" at No. 3 Steel Plant; more than 80% of the furnace operators of No. 3 Steel Plant's open-hearth furnace workshop have studied at No. 1 Steel Plant. The timely exchange of advanced experience has enabled the rapid solution of many key problems in the production of both sides. Not long ago, the open-hearth furnace workers of No. 1 Steel Plant concentrated their technological innovation achievements since this year and summarized them into five major advanced experiences. These experiences are of great benefit to increasing the charge and speeding up smelting in open-hearth furnaces. They immediately sent people, led by Deputy Director on Duty Zhong Daming, to perform operations in front of the furnace at No. 3 Steel Plant in batches to assist No. 3 Steel Plant in testing and promotion, which shortened the smelting time of No. 3 Steel Plant's open-hearth furnaces by about one hour and created a fast smelting record of four hours and fifty-two minutes for one furnace of steel, catching up with and surpassing No. 1 Steel Plant. Seeing that No. 3 Steel Plant had surpassed them, the workers of No. 1 Steel Plant spurred their horses and forged ahead, shortening the smelting time to four hours and thirty-five minutes on the third day, surpassing No. 3 Steel Plant again and continuing to lead. Although the open-hearth furnace of No. 3 Steel Plant temporarily lagged behind, they immediately introduced any new creations to No. 1 Steel Plant. Once, they successfully tested a new technology to increase furnace temperature, and immediately established a "treasure-seeking and treasure-sending team," led by Han Xinliang, a national advanced producer and deputy director of the workshop, to spread this experience to the furnace front of No. 1 Steel Plant, enabling the open-hearth furnace of No. 1 Steel Plant to create a higher record of fast smelting.

In the competition, the workers of the two workshops humbly and earnestly learned from each other's experiences. Although the open-hearth furnace workers of No. 1 Steel Plant won the national small open-hearth furnace red flag, they believed that there were still shortcomings in the production of their workshop, and they were able to humbly learn from No. 3 Steel Plant. In September, they crossed the river five times to work alongside workers at No. 3 Steel Plant, learning the advanced experience of rapid steelmaking such as batch charging, layered burnout, and mixed charging from No. 3 Steel Plant. As soon as the workers of No. 3 Steel Plant successfully tested the "high-temperature furnace patching" experience, they immediately invited the workers of No. 3 Steel Plant to their workshop to teach on site, reducing the furnace patching time from fifteen minutes to ten minutes. The open-hearth furnace workers of No. 3 Steel Plant learned from No. 1 Steel Plant even faster and more diligently. When the workers of No. 1 Steel Plant went to No. 3 Steel Plant to demonstrate desulfurization after the furnace, they adopted the method of "man-to-man marking" like in basketball, learning carefully and meticulously, leaving no detail unlearned, so that the desulfurization effect quickly reached the level of No. 1 Steel Plant.

When the open-hearth furnace workers of No. 1 and No. 3 Steel Plants heard that the other side was in trouble, they always tried their best to help solve the problem, showing a noble style of "urgently helping others." At the end of August, when the open-hearth furnace of No. 1 Steel Plant was about to undergo a medium repair, the employees of the open-hearth furnace workshop of No. 3 Steel Plant took the initiative to call and ask No. 1 Steel Plant for the furnace repair date, and sent six experienced mud workers with tools to No. 1 Steel Plant to provide support, ensuring the smooth completion of the medium repair of No. 1 Steel Plant.

This kind of extensive collaboration has led to a comprehensive leap forward in the production of both workshops. The steel output of the open-hearth furnace of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant in September increased by 10% compared with August, the qualified rate of steel ingots increased from 98.86% in the past to 99.38%, and the amount of pig iron used per ton of open-hearth furnace steel decreased by fifty-two kilograms compared with August. The two open-hearth furnaces of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant produced more than 1,000 tons of steel in the first half of October than in the same period in September, and also made new progress in improving quality and reducing iron consumption.

    先进经验我有你也有　生产关键你攻我来帮
    上钢一厂三厂协作风格高生产齐跃进
    两个厂的四座平炉携手跨入全国平炉先进行列
    本报上海26日电　黄浦江东西两岸的上海第一钢厂和上海第三钢厂的两个平炉车间，在你追我赶的竞赛热潮中，互相认真地学，无私地帮，彼此亲如手足地进行大协作，生产双双跃进。9月份，上钢一厂两座平炉的利用系数比年初时提高了3.461，其中一号平炉最近被评为全市的“标兵炉”。10月上半月，上钢三厂的平炉利用系数也接近了上钢一厂的高产水平。现在，这两个厂的四座平炉已携手跨入了全国平炉的先进行列。
    上海这两个平炉车间的竞赛大跃进以来从未间断。今年上钢一厂平炉车间从三厂平炉车间夺得全国小型平炉高产红旗以后，一个保红旗，一个夺红旗，竞赛更进入了高潮。在“一切为了多出钢”的思想指导下，两个车间的工人斗志更加昂扬，互助协作的风格也越来越高。他们既是竞赛的对手，又是生产的帮手。大家都把对方的成就看成自己的成就，把对方的困难看成自己的困难，在生产中互相鼓舞；互相支援。工人们都说：“红旗插在一厂平炉也好，插在三厂平炉也好，都是上海钢铁工人的光荣。我们一定要高高举起全国小型平炉的高产红旗，保证胜利完成今年的炼钢任务。”
    一厂平炉工人热情地希望三厂平炉超过自己，诚恳地帮助三厂平炉赶自己。三厂平炉工人在学习先进、猛赶先进的同时，也积极支持一厂平炉先进更先进，“更上一层楼”。今年以来，两个车间的职工互相交流经验，你来我往，川流不息。一厂工人曾二十五次摆渡过江，到三厂“送宝”“取经”；三厂平炉车间的炉前工人，80％以上到一厂学习过。先进经验的及时交流，使双方生产中的不少关键问题迅速解决。不久以前，一厂平炉工人把他们今年以来的各项技术革新成果集中起来，总结成五大先进经验。这些经验对平炉多装快炼有很大好处。他们立即派人由值班副主任钟大明带队，分批到三厂炉前操作表演，协助三厂试验推广，使三厂平炉冶炼时间也缩短了一小时左右，并创造了一炉钢用四小时五十二分钟的快炼纪录，赶上并超过了一厂。一厂工人看到三厂超过了自己，更扬鞭催马，奋勇前进，第三天就把冶炼时间缩短到四小时三十五分，又超过三厂，继续领先。三厂平炉虽然暂时落后，但他们只要有一点新的创造，也立即向一厂介绍。有一次，他们试验成功一种提高炉温的新技术，就马上成立了“取经送宝队”，由全国先进生产者、车间副主任韩忻亮带领一批人，到一厂炉前传播这一经验，使一厂平炉创造了快炼的更高纪录。
    两个车间的工人在竞赛中，都虚心、踏实地学习对方的点滴经验。一厂平炉工人虽然夺得了全国小型平炉红旗，但是他们认为自己车间的生产仍有不足之处，都能虚心向三厂学习。9月份，他们五次渡江，到三厂平炉跟班劳动，学习三厂分批加料、分层烧透、混合加料等快速炼钢的先进经验。三厂工人刚刚试验成功“高温补炉”的经验，他们就马上邀请三厂工人到自己车间在现场传授，使补炉时间从十五分钟压缩到十分钟。三厂平炉工人学习一厂，更是学得快，学得勤。一厂工人到三厂表演炉后脱硫时，他们采取打篮球“人盯人”的办法，认真仔细、点滴不漏地学习，使去硫效果很快达到了一厂的水平。
    一厂、三厂的平炉工人听到对方有困难，总是千方百计地帮助解决，表现了“急人之急”的高尚风格。8月底一厂平炉快要中修的时候，三厂平炉车间的职工主动打电话问一厂修炉日期，届时派出六名经验丰富的泥工，带着工具到一厂支援，保证一厂平炉顺利完成中修。
    这种大协作，使两个车间的生产都全面跃进。上钢一厂平炉9月份的钢产量比8月份提高10％，钢锭合格率从过去的98.86％提高到99.38％，每一吨平炉钢用的生铁比8月降低五十二公斤。上钢三厂的两座平炉，10月上半月比9月同期多炼了一千多吨钢，在提高质量、降低铁耗方面也有新的进展。（附图片）
