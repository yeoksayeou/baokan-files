(Our dispatch from Shenyang, October 5th) The Lighthouse People's Commune in Liaoyang City, in the face of the extraordinary flood of the Taizi River in early August, an event unseen in a century, organized tens of thousands of farmers to not only overcome the sudden attack of the flood but also achieve a great victory in rapidly restoring production and rebuilding their homes after the disaster.

The Lighthouse People's Commune is located in the northern part of Liaoyang City, with fertile soil and abundant production of grains and cotton, with a total of more than 80,000 commune members.

When eastern Liaoning was hit by an extraordinary flood unseen in a century in early August, the Lighthouse Commune was one of the most severely affected people's communes. Of the 57 production brigades in the commune, 34 brigades along the Taizi River suffered varying degrees of disaster. Thanks to the active rescue efforts of the commune organization, the disaster was minimized.

As the flood gradually subsided, the Lighthouse People's Commune more fully utilized the superiority of "large-scale and public ownership," vigorously organizing commune members to rapidly restore production and rebuild their homes. In order to make up for the disaster losses, the commune put forward the battle slogan of "Work hard for a month, turn severe disasters into light disasters, light disasters into no disasters, and increase grain production in non-disaster areas," launching a new high tide of increasing production and practicing economy centered on grain and vegetables. At the same time, the commune established a production and disaster relief committee to strengthen the specific leadership of the production and disaster relief work.

In the initial days of restoring production, several tasks such as draining water to save seedlings, rushing to harvest and plant, and building houses were squeezed together in the affected brigades, and there were widespread problems such as a shortage of labor, seeds, and agricultural implements. The commune mobilized more than 3,500 people from the non-disaster areas and allocated 120 large carts and 50,000 jin of vegetable seeds to support the disaster areas. The commune members in the disaster areas were greatly encouraged, and more than 90% of the labor force participated in the rush to harvest and plant. According to statistics, in the half month after the disaster, the affected teams drained more than 2,500 hectares of waterlogged farmland; rushed to harvest more than 560 hectares of green hemp and more than 300 hectares of corn; and rushed to plant 1,100 hectares of autumn vegetables, which was nearly doubled compared with last year. Now every public canteen can eat fresh vegetables every day.

The Tianhe Irrigation Area irrigates more than 800 hectares of paddy fields and is the commune's rice production base. A flood washed away all the canals and buildings in the irrigation area, and the rice that was flowering and filling was threatened by drought after the disaster. At this time, the seven beneficiary brigades in the irrigation area were busy rushing to harvest, plant, and build houses, and could not spare people to repair the canals. In order to rescue the rice, the commune transferred more than 700 laborers from non-disaster areas, plus the support from Liaoyang City, and organized a repair army of more than 1,900 people to work hard for ten days, repairing more than 3,000 meters of canals. The commune also transferred nine diesel pumps to the major brigades in the irrigation area, finally enabling more than 400 hectares of rice to be irrigated in time. At present, the rice is golden and about to mature.

While organizing forces to restore production, the Lighthouse Commune made proper arrangements for the lives of commune members. The commune allocated a large amount of grain and coal to supply the disaster areas, so that all 50-plus canteens in the disaster areas resumed work four or five days after the flood receded. With the assistance of the commune, more than 4,700 half-collapsed houses have been completely repaired, and 200 to 300 new houses have been built. All commune members in the disaster-stricken brigades have housing.

Commune-run industries, supply and marketing cooperatives, and schools actively participated in the production and disaster relief work, giving full play to the superiority of the five-in-one combination of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs. After the disaster, the commune's agricultural implement factory rushed to produce more than 5,000 sickles, more than 400 iron shovels, and more than 120 large carts to support production in the disaster areas; the commune's brick and tile factory burned more than 60,000 bricks to supply the disaster areas for building houses. Before the transportation lines were restored, the staff of the supply and marketing department carried and pushed 39 kinds of food, medicine, and daily necessities worth 87,000 yuan to support the disaster areas, and at the same time purchased more than 360 pigs and a large number of agricultural and sideline products in the disaster areas, increasing the income of the disaster areas by more than 24,000 yuan and enlivening the economy of the disaster areas. The commune organized more than 100 teachers and more than 2,000 students to actively participate in the rush to harvest and plant movement in the disaster areas.

The communist spirit of non-disaster-stricken brigades and disaster-stricken brigades helping each other in the same boat and sharing weal and woe has been greatly promoted, and a new atmosphere of unprecedented unity and intimacy has emerged between teams.

The non-disaster areas and the disaster areas took the method of fixed pairing to implement counterpart contract support. On the second day that the Dalu Production Brigade was paired with the disaster-stricken Heishantun Brigade, branch secretary Wang Delin and team leader Xia Hongde personally visited the Heishantun Brigade to understand the needs after the disaster. They immediately sent two carpenters and 30 laborers to help the Heishantun Brigade build houses and rush to plant autumn vegetables; transferred five large carts to the Lighthouse Station to transport more than three tons of coal for Heishantun, solving the difficulty of lacking fuel after the disaster; hearing that the Heishantun canteen lacked vegetables, they sent more than 3,000 jin of vegetables. The cadres and masses of the Heishantun Brigade unanimously reflected, "The Dalu Brigade is really helping us in our time of need."

Some large livestock in the disaster areas were lacking grass and weak. The commune party committee called on the large livestock to be transferred to the non-disaster areas for grazing. The Donghuangdi, Wulitai, Zhouguantun, Shanyuebao, and Jianshanzi brigades, which were rich in aquatic plants, contracted all the grazing tasks. After more than 50 livestock in the Gezhenpao Brigade were transferred to the Wulitai Brigade, the Wulitai Brigade's squad leader Jin Yuzhen personally led them to graze in the mountains where the aquatic plants were abundant, so that the livestock quickly became stronger. Recently, the production brigades in the non-disaster areas heard that 21 brigades in the disaster areas had difficulties in reserving seeds for crops, and they linked up with each other to contract all 750,000 jin of seeds needed by the disaster areas next year.

The Lighthouse People's Commune not only stood firm in the face of this extraordinary flood, but also became stronger and more consolidated after severe testing and training.

In this unprecedented struggle against floods and disasters, people have become more aware of the great power of the people's commune and regard it as their lifeline. In the commune's big family, everyone is full of strength and actively participates in the struggle to increase production and save food for the famine.

    统一安排　大搞协作　恢复生产　重建家园
    灯塔公社抗洪救灾力量巨大
    本报沈阳5日电　辽阳市灯塔人民公社，在8月初太子河发生百年不遇的特大洪水面前，组织数万农民不仅战胜了洪水的突然袭击，而且取得了灾后迅速恢复生产、重建家园的伟大胜利。
    灯塔人民公社在辽阳市北部，土质肥沃，盛产五谷和棉麻，共有社员八万多人。
    在8月初辽宁东部遭受百年不遇的特大洪水袭击的时候，灯塔公社是受灾最重的几个人民公社中的一个。全社五十七个生产大队中，沿太子河的三十四个大队都受了不同程度的灾。由于公社组织力量积极抢救，因而把灾害缩小到最小的限度。
    灯塔公社在洪水渐渐消退时，更充分发挥了一大二公的优越性，大力组织社员迅速恢复生产、重建家园。为了弥补灾害损失，公社提出了“大干一个月，重灾变轻灾，轻灾变无灾，无灾区多增产粮食”的战斗口号，掀起了以粮、菜为中心的增产节约新高潮。与此同时，公社成立了生产救灾委员会，加强了生产救灾工作的具体领导。
    在恢复生产的最初日子里，各受灾大队排水救苗、抢收抢种、修建房屋等几项活计挤到一起，普遍存在缺劳力、缺种籽、缺农具等问题。公社便从非灾区的大队里，动员了三千五百多人，调拨了一百二十台大车和五万斤菜籽，支援灾区。灾区社员受到很大鼓舞，90％以上的劳动力都参加了抢收抢种。据统计，灾后半个多月，受灾各队就排除农田积水二千五百多公顷；抢收青麻五百六十多公顷，玉米三百多公顷；抢种秋菜一千一百公顷，比去年扩大了将近一倍，现在各个公共食堂每天都可吃到新鲜的蔬菜。
    天河灌区共灌溉八百多公顷稻田，是全社的水稻生产基地。一场洪水把灌区的渠道和建筑物全部冲毁，正在扬花灌浆的水稻，灾后又遭到干旱的威胁。在这个时候灌区的七个受益大队，正忙着抢收抢种和修盖房屋，抽不出人来修整渠道。为了抢救水稻，公社从非灾区抽调了七百多名劳动力，加上辽阳市的支援，共组织了一千九百多人的抢修大军，大干十天，整修渠道三千多米。公社又调给灌区各大队九台柴油抽水机，终于使四百多公顷水稻及时灌上了水。目前水稻已一片金黄，即将成熟。
    灯塔公社在组织力量恢复生产的同时，对社员生活进行了妥善安排。公社调拨了大批粮食和煤炭供应灾区，使灾区五十多个食堂，在洪水退后四、五天便全部恢复工作。在公社的协助下，目前四千七百多间半倒塌的房屋已全部修复，又盖起二、三百间新房。所有受灾大队的社员都有了住房。
    社办工业、供销社、学校都积极投入生产救灾工作，发挥了工农商学兵五位一体的优越性。灾后，公社农具厂赶制出五千多把镰刀、四百多把铁锹和一百二十多台大车，支援灾区生产；公社砖瓦厂烧了六万多块砖，供应灾区修建房屋。交通线还未恢复，供销部门职工便人背车推把三十九种价值八万七千元的食品、医药、日用百货等支援了灾区，同时在灾区收购了三百六十多头猪和大量农副业产品，使灾区增加了二万四千多元的收入，活跃了灾区的经济。公社组织了一百多名教师和二千多名学生，积极参加了灾区抢收抢种运动。
    非灾区各大队与灾区各大队同舟共济、患难与共的共产主义精神大大发扬，队和队之间出现了空前团结亲密的新气象。
    非灾区和灾区的各生产大队采取固定挂钩的办法，实行了对口包干支援。大路生产大队和受灾的黑山屯大队挂钩的第二天，支部书记王德林和大队长夏洪德便亲自到黑山屯大队登门访问，了解了灾后需要，马上派去两名木匠和三十个劳动力，帮助黑山屯大队盖房子和抢种秋菜；调出五台大车到灯塔车站为黑山屯运了三吨多煤，解决了灾后缺燃料的困难；听说黑山屯食堂缺菜，他们又送去了三千多斤蔬菜。黑山屯大队的干部和群众一致反映说：“大路大队真是雪中送炭。”
    灾区有些大牲畜缺草瘦弱，公社党委号召把大牲畜转移到非灾区去放牧。水草丰茂的东荒地、伍里台、周官屯、山岳堡、尖山子等大队，便把放养任务全部包了下来。戈针泡大队的五十多头牲畜转移到伍里台大队后，伍里台大队的小队长金玉珍亲自领着到山里水草丰茂的地方去放牧，使牲畜迅速强壮起来。最近，非灾区的生产大队听说灾区有二十一个大队作物留种有困难，又各自互相挂了钩，把灾区明年需要的种子七十五万斤全部包下来。
    灯塔人民公社在这次百年不遇的特大洪水冲击中不但屹立不动，并且经过严重的考验和锻炼，显得更加坚强和巩固了。
    在这次史无前例的抗洪救灾斗争中，人们更加认清了人民公社的巨大力量，把它看成自己的命根子。在公社的大家庭里，人人显得浑身是力量，积极投入了增加生产和节约度荒的斗争。
