    Waste Recycling Workshop
    Next to the sand casting workshop of the Guangzhou Locomotive Depot, there is a small, inconspicuous wooden house, which is the waste recycling workshop of this depot. Although there are only a few hand hammers, steel brushes, and some simple local machines, many waste materials are turned into useful materials by them.
    Recently, they have produced a new product - high-quality welding rods. These are made from waste smoke pipes from locomotive boilers. Originally, every time the workers in the boiler group of the locomotive depot repaired the locomotive boilers, they had to cut off the burst smoke pipes inside the boiler. Each cut-off smoke pipe was seven or eight inches long. Before the waste recycling workshop was established, they were treated as waste materials. After the waste recycling workshop was established in April this year, the workers knew that these smoke pipes were made of high-quality steel, so they split them one by one, hammered them flat, and then chiseled them into welding rods. Tests have proved that the quality of this kind of welding rod is no less than that of imported high-quality welding rods.
    Some people think that waste recycling is a simple operation, but in fact, it also involves technology and requires a major technical revolution. For example, the large amount of metal scraps produced by the machine tool group every day are of various kinds, including copper, steel, and alloys, all mixed together, making it very difficult to separate them. Initially, the workers in this workshop used magnets to attract iron filings, which was not very efficient. Later, with the help of veteran workers from the electricity group, they made an electromagnetic separator, which increased efficiency by more than ten times. From then on, the large amount of metal scraps swept out of the machine tool group every day could be separated for different treatments. Now, the "waste" utilized by this workshop every month is worth more than 1,000 yuan.

    废料更生车间
    在广州机务段翻砂场旁边，有一间不大惹人注意的小木板房，这就是这个机务段的废料更生车间。这里虽然只有几把手锤、钢刷和一些土简机械，但是许多废料一经它们的手，就变成有用的材料了。
    最近这里又出产了一种新产品——优质电焊条。它就是用机车锅炉上的废烟管做的。原来机务段锅炉组的工人每次修理机车锅炉的时候，总是要把锅炉里面那些爆裂的烟管切掉，切除出来的烟管每条都有七、八吋长。在废料更生车间成立前，它是被当作废料处理的。今年四月，废料更生车间成立以后，工人们知道这些烟管都是优质钢材做的，就把它们一根根地剖开锤平，再凿成电焊条。试验证明，这种电焊条的质量不亚于进口的优质焊条。
    有人认为搞废料翻新，是一项简单的操作，其实这里也有技术，也需要大搞技术革命。譬如机床组每天加工中产生的大量金属碎屑，各种各样，有铜的，有钢的，也有合金的，都混杂在一起，把它们分开来很不容易。最初，这个车间的职工利用磁铁来吸铁屑，效率不高；后来他们在电力组的老师傅的帮助下，制成了一部电磁分离器，效率提高十多倍。从此每天机床组扫出来的大量金属碎屑，都能分开作不同处理了。现在，这个车间每月利用的“废物”，就值一千多元。
