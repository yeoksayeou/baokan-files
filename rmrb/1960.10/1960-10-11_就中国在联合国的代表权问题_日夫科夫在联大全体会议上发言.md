Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 10th October: The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reports that Zhivkov, head of the Bulgarian delegation to the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, delivered a speech on the question of China's representation in the United Nations at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly on October 3rd.

Zhivkov said: A few days ago, the United Nations organization admitted sixteen newly liberated countries as its member states. This is one of the important decisions of this session of the General Assembly. However, after welcoming these countries into the United Nations organization, we cannot remain silent on the unacceptable fact that the people with the longest tradition of struggle against colonialism and imperialism, the great Chinese people, are not represented in it. The largest country on our planet is not in the ranks of the United Nations. Due to the conspiracies of the United States and the unwise policies of its government, one in every four people in the world has not been represented in our international organization for eleven years since the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Zhivkov said: I say that the Chinese people are not represented, because everyone can clearly see that the political corpse in Taipei does not represent the Chinese people. There has never been, and there will never be, two Chinas. There is only one China and the island of Taiwan, a part of Chinese territory, which is temporarily occupied by the United States armed forces and turned into a US military base.

The question of China's representation in the United Nations organization has been before this organization for many years. Today, it is difficult for an honest political figure or politician to insist that the question of China's representation has not been clarified. It has been clarified from all angles: politically, legally, and procedurally, as well as from the point of view of the charter and principles of the United Nations organization. Whenever this issue is raised in order to obtain a just solution, the discussion of this issue is always rejected without any convincing reasons. Now someone is even suggesting refusing to discuss this issue, which is of such great significance to international affairs and the prestige of the United Nations organization, and we cannot but express deep surprise at this.

When talking about the "argument" that the United States and its representatives in the United Nations constantly repeat that the People's Republic of China is an "aggressor" and has aggressive intentions towards the United States, Zhivkov said that this accusation is not only strange, but also a shameless slander against the Chinese people and the Chinese government. In this regard, Zhivkov cited many facts, such as the use of American military bases to encircle socialist countries, including the People's Republic of China, the violation of China's airspace and territorial waters by American military aircraft and warships, and the suppression of the African people's struggle for freedom and independence. These facts all prove that it is not the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries that are taking aggressive actions, but the United States of America and its allies.

Zhivkov said: Just look at how shameless the American imperialists and their spokesmen in the United Nations organization can be: they declare China as an aggressor because it wants to recover the territory of the Chinese island of Taiwan, which is occupied by American troops. This is the fallacy of fallacies. Since ancient times, Taiwan and other coastal islands near China have been Chinese land. The island of Taiwan has always belonged to China and will continue to belong to China. It is the sacred duty and right of the Chinese people to liberate this piece of land belonging to them and return it to the motherland. The Chinese people have the full support of the entire socialist camp and all progressive mankind in their just struggle.

Zhivkov emphasized that the United States and its representatives in the United Nations' so-called "argument" about the "aggressiveness" of People's China—which they are now trying to use to block China's path to the United Nations organization—is untenable.

Zhivkov said: The arguments put forward by the representatives of the United States show that the American ruling clique does not respect the Chinese people, does not respect the United Nations organization, and does not respect the lofty platform of our international organization. It is quite obvious that the United States' accusations against the People's Republic of China are nothing more than an old trick of a thief crying "stop thief." The aggressor is not the People's Republic of China. The aggressor is the United States of America.

What is the implication of this argument of the United States? Its implication is: People's China, the regime and government of the People's Republic of China, are not qualified to have representatives in the United Nations. It is indeed a strange thing to take the efforts of a regime and government to improve the situation of a quarter of the world's population and its peaceful foreign policy as a serious reason to oppose its gaining its seat in the United Nations organization. To put forward such an "argument" means disregarding the facts and the most basic logic.

Zhivkov continued: Despite the many conspiracies and obstacles created by the United States, the People's Republic of China has now existed for more than eleven years. It is advancing and achieving undeniable achievements in all aspects of life. The People's Republic of China has established strong political, economic and cultural relations all over the world. The government of People's China has been recognized by dozens of countries in Europe, Asia and elsewhere. It pursues a peaceful policy, participates in important international conferences and takes a series of peaceful actions. Together with the governments of other Asian countries, it announced the "Panchsheel" policy and put forward specific proposals for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Pacific region with the participation of the United States.

Zhivkov emphasized: Obviously, the problem is not the non-existent Chinese aggression. In fact, the problem is to not restore the rights of the people's socialist China and to prevent a socialist country from gaining its seat in the United Nations organization. Therefore, the problem here involves a socialist country, various socialist countries, the influence of socialism on the world, and their infectious example to the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America and other regions of the world. It is precisely the infectious example of socialism and the great Marxist-Leninist doctrine that has conquered the thoughts and hearts of people in various countries and become a positive factor in the struggle for peace, democracy and socialism. The great appeal and revolutionary transforming power of communist ideas is not growing year by year, but month by month and day by day. This is what threatens and frightens the American imperialists.

Zhivkov said: You imperialists, no matter what you do, you cannot stop the relentless victorious advance of Marxist-Leninist ideas, you cannot dim the radiance of communist ideas, and you cannot avoid the enormous influence of socialism on the people of the world. But should all this prevent the United Nations organization from becoming a true and authoritative instrument for strengthening peace and cooperation among the people of all countries? Is it not clear today that without the participation of the People's Republic of China, without its participation in the United Nations organization, major world problems cannot be solved smoothly?

Zhivkov said: Instead of correctly considering the world situation, especially the situation in Asia, and considering the actual facts, the United States stubbornly supports the so-called government of Taiwan. But the puppets of Taiwan are nothing more than a group of traitors who call themselves representatives of the Chinese people and have been abandoned by their people. They exist and are still able to exist because they are under the protection of the US Navy and Air Force.

Zhivkov emphasized that this policy of the imperialists to establish subservient governments in many countries around the world is doomed to bankruptcy, because all anti-people dictatorial regimes that most obediently satisfy the wishes of the United States are disappearing and will continue to disappear. Neither imperialist orders, nor bribes and blackmail, nor empty promises of economic aid can stop this process.

If we separately adopt the suggestions of the General Affairs Committee or the United States regarding not discussing the issue of China's representation at this meeting again, we will not only be violating the rights granted to us by the Charter, but also violating our basic obligation to abide by the representativeness of our organization. In this way, we will undermine the prestige of the United Nations organization and weaken its authority at a time when the authority of the United Nations is more necessary than ever before. In view of the great significance of this issue, I would like to emphasize once again that this will affect the efficiency of the United Nations organization and hinder the resolution of the major problems it faces. Because it is extremely obvious that when our organization excludes a country representing a quarter of mankind, its actions will not be effective.

Despite slanders and attempts to sabotage, such as now forcing us to discuss the "Tibet" and "Hungary" issues at this meeting, the number of countries insisting on recognizing the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China is increasing year by year. Zhivkov emphasized that sooner or later, the People's Republic of China will gain its legitimate seat in the United Nations organization, regardless of whether this is in accordance with the wishes of the United States.

Zhivkov said: History is the relentless teacher of all countries. You American gentlemen still do not want to recognize the People's Republic of China. This shows that you have not yet learned the lessons you should have learned from your own history. Those politicians, statesmen, and governments who do not consider the lessons of history are moving forward in the dark and are causing irreparable damage to their own people. The facts of history are irresistible. Their existence has nothing to do with whether they are recognized or not. The entire history of mankind shows that they will inevitably be recognized, whether it is today or tomorrow. The sooner you abandon your position against the People's Republic of China, the better.

Sound reason urgently demands that the position and methods adopted by the United States against China be condemned as incompatible with the purposes, tasks and goals established by the United Nations organization and removed from the United Nations organization. The United Nations General Assembly must discuss the issue of China's representation. The People's Republic of China must finally obtain its seat in the United Nations, which will be a clear demonstration of the sense of justice in the United Nations organization and its maturity and wisdom.

Zhivkov concluded: The delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria supports the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation regarding the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations organization.

    就中国在联合国的代表权问题
    日夫科夫在联大全体会议上发言
    新华社索非亚10日电　据保加利亚通讯社报道，保加利亚出席联合国第十五届大会代表团团长日夫科夫10月3日在联合国大会全体会议上就中国在联合国的代表权问题发表了演说。
    日夫科夫说：几天以前，联合国组织接纳了十六个新解放的国家为它的会员国。这是本届联大会议的重要决定之一。但是，在欢迎这些国家进入联合国组织以后，我们不能对这样一种不能容许的事实默不作声：有着最长久的同殖民主义和帝国主义斗争的传统的人民，伟大的中国人民，在它里面还没有代表。我们星球上最大的国家不在联合国的队伍里。由于美国的阴谋和它的政府的不明智的政策，世界上每四个人中就有一个人在我们的国际组织中没有代表，这种情况从中华人民共和国成立到现在已经存在十一年了。
    日夫科夫说：我说中国人民没有代表，因为大家都能明显地看出，台北的政治僵尸并不代表中国人民。从来不曾有过、并且永远也不会有两个中国。只有一个中国和中国领土的一部分的台湾岛，这个岛暂时被美国武装部队所霸占，而变成美国的一个军事基地。
    中国在联合国组织中的代表权问题已经在这个组织的面前放了许多年。今天很难有一个正直的政界人物或政治家能够硬说中国代表权的问题还没有澄清。它从一切角度看都已经澄清了：在政治上、法律上和程序上，以及从联合国组织的章程和原则的观点来看都已经澄清了。每当这个问题被提出来以便获得正当的解决的时候，关于这个问题的讨论总是遭到拒绝，而没有提出任何令人信服的理由。现在竟然又有人建议，拒绝讨论这个对国际事务和联合国组织的威信具有如此重大意义的问题，我们对此不能不表示深为诧异。
    在谈到美国及其在联合国组织中的代表们不断重复地说中华人民共和国是“侵略者”并对美国怀有侵略意图的“论点”的时候，日夫科夫说，这种指责不但奇怪，而且也是对中国人民和中国政府的一种无耻的诽谤。在这方面，日夫科夫举出了许多事实，诸如用美国军事基地来包围包括中华人民共和国在内的社会主义国家，美国军用飞机和军舰侵犯中国领空和领海，镇压非洲人民的争取自由和独立的斗争等，这些事实都证明，采取侵略行为的不是中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家，而是美利坚合众国及其盟国。
    日夫科夫说：只要看一看，美帝国主义者和他们在联合国组织中的发言人能够无耻到什么地步：他们把中国宣布为侵略者，因为它要收回被美军占领的中国台湾岛的领土，这是谬论中的谬论。自从远古以来，台湾和中国附近的其他沿海岛屿就是中国的土地。台湾岛一直属于中国，并且仍将属于中国。解放这片属于他们的土地和使它回到祖国，是中国人民的神圣责任和权利。中国人民在他们的这一正义斗争中得到整个社会主义阵营和全体进步人类的充分支持。
    日夫科夫着重指出，美国及其在联合国组织中的代表关于人民中国的所谓“侵略性”的“论点”——他们现在正在试图用它来阻断中国到联合国组织的道路——是站不住脚的。
    日夫科夫说：美国的代表们所提出的这种论点说明美国统治集团不尊重中国人民，不尊重联合国组织和我们的国际组织的崇高的讲坛。十分明显，美国对中华人民共和国的指责无非是一种贼喊捉贼的陈旧手法而已。侵略者不是中华人民共和国。侵略者是美利坚合众国。
    美国的这种论点的含意是什么呢？它的含意是：人民中国，中华人民共和国的政权和政府，并不具有在联合国中派有代表的资格。把一个政权和政府改善地球上四分之一人口的境遇的努力和它的和平外交政策作为反对它在联合国组织中取得它的席位的认真理由，这实在是一件怪事。提出这样的“论点”，就意味着不顾事实和最起码的逻辑。
    日夫科夫接着说：尽管美国进行了许多阴谋活动和制造了许多障碍，但是中华人民共和国现在已经存在了十一年多。它在生活的各方面都正在前进和取得无可争辩的成绩。中华人民共和国在全世界建立了强有力的政治、经济和文化关系。人民中国的政府已经得到欧洲、亚洲和其他地方的几十个国家的承认。它奉行和平政策，参加重要的国际会议和采取一系列的和平行动。它同其他亚洲国家的政府在一起，宣布了“潘查希拉”政策，并且提出了关于在太平洋地区设立一个有美国参加的无核武器地区的具体建议。
    日夫科夫强调说：很明显，问题并不在于不存在的中国侵略。实际上，问题在于要不恢复人民的社会主义的中国的权利，阻止一个社会主义国家在联合国组织中取得它的席位。因此，这里的问题涉及一个社会主义国家，各个社会主义国家，社会主义对世界的影响，它们对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界上其他地区的人民的具有感染力的榜样。正是社会主义和伟大的马克思主义和列宁主义学说的具有感染力的榜样，征服了各国人民的思想和心灵，成为争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中的一个积极因素，共产主义思想的巨大吸引力和革命改造力不是在一年年地增长，而是在一月月和一天天地增长。这就是使美帝国主义者受到威胁和感到惊慌的东西。
    日夫科夫说：你们帝国主义者，不论你们做些什么，都阻止不了马克思主义和列宁主义思想的毫不容情的胜利前进，都无法使共产主义思想的光芒暗淡下去，无法避免社会主义对世界人民的巨大影响。但是，难道这一切应当妨碍联合国组织成为一个真正的和有权威的加强和平和世界各国人民之间的合作的工具吗？今天没有中华人民共和国的参加，没有它参加联合国组织，重大的世界问题就无法顺利解决，这难道还不清楚吗？
    日夫科夫说：美国不对世界现状、特别是亚洲现状加以正确的考虑，不考虑实际的事实，反而顽固地支持台湾的所谓政府。但是台湾的傀儡们只不过是一些自称代表中国人民、被他们的人民所抛弃的卖国贼罢了。他们所以存在、所以仍然能够存在，是由于他们是在美国海军和空军的保护之下。
    日夫科夫强调指出，帝国主义者的这种在世界上许多国家里设立俯首贴耳的政府的政策是注定要破产的，因为所有最顺从地满足美国的意愿的反人民独裁政权都在消失，并且将继续消失。不论是帝国主义的命令、还是贿赂和讹诈，或者是关于经济援助的空洞诺言，都无法阻止这个过程。
    如果我们分别采纳总务委员会或美国的关于在这次会议上又不讨论中国代表权问题的建议，我们将不但是破坏宪章所授予我们的权利，并且也是违反我们的遵守我们的组织的代表性的基本义务。这样我们就会破坏联合国组织的威信并且在联合国的权威比过去任何时候都更为必要的时刻削弱它的权威。鉴于这个问题的重大意义，我想再一次着重指出，这将影响到联合国组织的效率和阻碍它所面临的重大问题的解决。因为极为明显，当我们的组织把代表着人类四分之一的国家排除在外面的时候，它的行动就不会有效。
    尽管污蔑和企图进行破坏，例如现在在这个会议上强迫我们讨论“西藏”和“匈牙利”问题，坚持承认中华人民共和国的合法权利的国家的数目正在逐年增加。日夫科夫着重指出，中华人民共和国迟早将取得它在联合国组织中的合法席位，不管这是否符合美国的愿望。
    日夫科夫说：历史是各国人民的毫不容情的教员。你们美国先生们还不想承认中华人民共和国。这表明你们还没有从你们自己的历史中得出应有的教训。那些不考虑历史教训的政界人物、政治家们和政府是在黑暗中前进，并且在为他们本国人民造成无法弥补的损害。历史的事实是不可抗拒的。它们的存在跟它们是否被承认是没有关系的，人类的全部历史表明它们将必然得到承认，不管是在今天还是在明天。你们越早抛弃你们的反对中华人民共和国的立场越好。
    健全的理性迫切要求把美国采取的反对中国的立场和方法看作同联合国组织建立的宗旨、任务和目标不相容的东西加以谴责和从联合国组织中去掉。联合国大会必须讨论中国的代表权问题。中华人民共和国必须终于获得它在联合国中的席位，这将是联合国组织中的正义感以及它的成熟和智慧的明证。
    日夫科夫最后说：保加利亚人民共和国代表团支持苏联代表团所提出的关于恢复中华人民共和国在联合国组织中的合法权利的建议。
