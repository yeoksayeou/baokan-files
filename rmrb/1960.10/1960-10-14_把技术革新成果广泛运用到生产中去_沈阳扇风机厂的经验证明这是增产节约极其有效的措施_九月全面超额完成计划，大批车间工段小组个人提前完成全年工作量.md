    This newspaper's Shenyang dispatch on the 13th: In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the Shenyang Fan Factory continues to deeply develop technological innovation and technological revolution, promoting, consolidating, and improving existing innovation achievements, ensuring the rapid realization of the increase production and practice economy plan. In September, the entire factory fully overfulfilled the monthly production increase and economy plan, with output increasing by 22.9% compared to August. From October 1st to 6th, production efficiency increased by another 15% compared to the same period in September. By the end of September, five workshops, eighteen sections, forty-nine groups, and four hundred and fifty-six individuals in the factory had completed the planned target for completing the 1960 workload ahead of schedule, as proposed in the increase production and economy plan, a quarter ahead of schedule.

    At the beginning of the increase production and economy movement, the factory's Party committee regarded the continued development of technological innovation and technological revolution as the main measure to tap the potential of the enterprise and realize the increase production and economy plan. They first mobilized the masses to conduct a review, sorting, and evaluation of the more than 100 indigenous equipment and more than 200 major advanced experiences created in the factory's previous period of technological innovation and technological revolution movement. They found that the vast majority of innovation projects were consolidated, promoted, and improved. At the same time, some indigenous equipment and advanced experiences that had a direct effect on solving the current production key problems had not been solidly and widely applied to production. The reasons for this situation, in addition to the fact that a few cadres and workers had incorrect ideas such as the "innovation has reached the top" theory, were mainly some problems in the work style of the cadres. A small number of cadres did not have a solid enough work style, grasping it for a while during the innovation upsurge and then relaxing afterwards. The innovation successes were put into use, and those with some technical problems were put aside. The technical problems that remained to be solved in some major projects were often more complex, but the organizational leadership was still general, and there was no concentrated superior force to solve these key problems.

    In response to these problems, the Party organizations at all levels of the factory first mobilized the masses to adopt methods of explanation, debate, and detailed accounting, using successful examples and effects of specific innovation projects to effectively overcome some erroneous ideas about innovation and correct their understanding. Next, the members of the Party committee and leading cadres at all levels went to the grassroots groups to grasp the key points and solve the specific problems in the promotion of innovation in a down-to-earth manner. For example, in order to solve the key problem of insufficient equipment at the beginning of the year, the Third Workshop manufactured an indigenous boring machine. Some people disliked it as being "indigenous" and thought it was not as easy to use as foreign ones, and were unwilling to use it. After Deputy Party Secretary Tong Enjiang went to the workshop and discovered this problem, he educated the workers on the one hand, and on the other hand, he organized the equipment and power section and relevant personnel to conduct an "expert consultation" on the spot to improve parts such as the handwheel. This enabled the boring machine to be put back into production and solved the key problem of insufficient equipment. At the beginning of the second quarter of this year, the workers of the Fifth Workshop created an automatic flat plate line, but it had not been used well since its installation. After Trade Union Chairman Yan Zaijiang went to this workshop, he analyzed the reasons for not being able to persist in using it with the workers, identified twelve technical problems in automatic feeding, automatic hoisting, etc., and immediately organized forces from all sides to improve them. In less than two days, these key technical problems were overcome, enabling the automatic line to continue to be used, saving twelve labor forces and increasing production efficiency twelvefold.

    In order to grasp the innovation projects to the end, they also ranked the innovation projects that needed to be consolidated, promoted, and improved according to the urgency of production needs, and the factory, workshops, sections, and groups at each level implemented them, with division of labor and contracting. For projects that had a major effect on the factory's current production, they adopted forms such as the "three-way combination" of cadres, workers, and technicians, using the method of concentrating forces to fight an annihilation war to organize promotion. To this end, technicians from process, design, and other departments went to the workshops with key projects, worked together with the workshop cadres and workers to tackle key problems, make appraisals, and organize promotion. The First Workshop used the new technology of surface hardening of tools, but it could not be sustained because some technical problems were not organized and solved by all parties in a centralized manner. This time, a "three-way combination technical appraisal team" was formed to repeatedly conduct experiments by drawing out lathes, conduct collective research, and develop a relatively complete set of process specifications. Then, a general assembly of workers in the entire workshop was convened to conduct on-site demonstrations, which quickly spread throughout the workshop. In total, from August 20 to now, 156 indigenous equipment in the factory have passed the technical barrier and put back into production, and 258 new technologies have been consolidated, improved and promoted, playing a major role in realizing the production increase and economy plan.

### 把技术革新成果广泛运用到生产中去  沈阳扇风机厂的经验证明这是增产节约极其有效的措施  九月全面超额完成计划，大批车间工段小组个人提前完成全年工作量

    把技术革新成果广泛运用到生产中去
    沈阳扇风机厂的经验证明这是增产节约极其有效的措施
    九月全面超额完成计划，大批车间工段小组个人提前完成全年工作量
    本报沈阳13日电　沈阳扇风机厂在增产节约运动中，继续深入开展技术革新和技术革命，推广、巩固和提高已有的革新成果，保证增产节约规划迅速实现。9月份，全厂全面超额完成了月度的增产节约计划，产量比8月份提高了22.9％。10月份，1至6日的生产效率又比9月同期提高了15％。到9月末，全厂有五个车间、十八个工段、四十九个小组、四百五十六个人提前一个季度实现了增产节约规划中提出的提前完成1960年工作量的计划指标。
    增产节约运动一开始，这个工厂的党委就把继续开展技术革新和技术革命作为挖掘企业潜力，实现增产节约计划的主要措施。他们首先发动群众对全厂在前一个时期技术革新和技术革命运动中创造出来的一百多台土设备和二百多项重大的先进经验，逐台、逐项地进行了复查、整理和鉴定，发现绝大部分革新项目得到巩固、推广和提高，同时也有一部分对解决当前生产关键有直接作用的土设备和先进经验，还没有能巩固地广泛运用到生产中去。造成这种情况的原因，除了少数干部和职工存在着革新“到顶论”等不正确的思想外，主要是干部作风上还存在一些问题。少数干部作风不够扎实，革新高潮时抓了一阵，过后就放松了；革新成功的用上了，技术上还有一些问题的就搁下了。而一些重大项目剩下来尚待解决的技术问题，往往是比较复杂的，但在组织领导上仍是一般地抓，没有集中优势力量解决这些关键。
    针对这些问题，工厂各级党组织首先发动群众采取讲解、辩论、算细账的方法，用具体革新项目的成功事例和效果，有力地克服了对革新的一些错误思想，端正了认识。接着，党委委员和各级领导干部又分头深入小组抓关键，切切实实地解决革新推广中的具体问题。如三车间在年初为了解决设备不足的关键，制造了一台土镗床，有些人嫌它“土”，认为没有洋的好使唤，不愿使用。党委副书记佟恩江深入到车间发现这一问题后，一方面对职工进行了教育，另一方面组织设备动力科和有关人员到现场进行了“会诊”，改进了手轮等部件。使这台镗床又重新投入了生产，解决了设备不足的关键。五车间职工在今年二季度初，创造了一条平板自动线，但自安装以来就没有很好地使用。工会主席阎在江深入到这个车间后，同工人一起分析了不能坚持使用的原因，找出了自动上料、自动起重等方面的十二个技术问题，立即组织了各方面的力量进行改进，不到两天的时间就攻破了这些技术关键，使这条自动线坚持使用下去，节省了十二个劳动力，提高了生产效率十二倍。
    为了把革新项目一抓到底，他们还把需要巩固、推广和提高的革新项目，按生产需要的急缓排队，由厂、车间、工段和小组层层落实，分工包干。对于对全厂当前生产有重大作用的项目，采取了干部、工人和技术人员“三结合”等形式，用集中力量打歼灭战的办法组织推广。为此，工艺、设计等科室技术人员，都随关键项目分头下车间，同车间干部、工人一起突击关键，做出鉴定，组织推广。一车间运用刀具表面硬化的新技术，由于有一些技术问题没有组织各方面的力量集中研究解决，不能坚持。这次组成“三结合技术鉴定组”，抽出车床来反复进行试验，集体研究，制订出一套比较完整的工艺规范，然后召开全车间工人大会，进行现场表演，很快就在全车间推广开来。总计从8月20日到现在，全厂已经有一百五十六台土设备过了技术关，重新投入生产，有二百五十八项新技术得以巩固，提高和推广，对实现增产节约计划起了重大作用。
