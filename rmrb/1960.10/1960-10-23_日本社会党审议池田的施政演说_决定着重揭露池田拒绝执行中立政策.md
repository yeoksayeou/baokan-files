Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st -- The Japanese Socialist Party decided today, during the current Diet session, to focus on exposing Ikeda's refusal to implement a neutral policy. This decision was made after the Socialist Party's Central Executive Committee reviewed Ikeda's policy speech delivered in the Diet today.

The Socialist Party believes that Ikeda's opposition to a neutral policy clearly indicates that he is inheriting Nobusuke Kishi's foreign policy.

The Socialist Party also decided to emphasize the issue of a neutral policy in the election campaign, exposing Ikeda's attempt to reject a neutral policy, thereby making Japan more closely dependent on American policy.

The Socialist Party's decision, in discussing Ikeda's avoidance of the issue of constitutional revision in his policy speech, stated that there is no indication that Ikeda has completely abandoned his idea of arbitrarily revising the constitution. The decision stated that therefore the party should closely monitor Ikeda's conspiracy to emasculate constitutional provisions through a series of accomplished facts.

The Socialist Party stated that it would resolutely oppose Ikeda's practice in his speech of lumping together right-wing terrorist acts with the people's right to petition the Diet and the right to strike.

    日本社会党审议池田的施政演说
    决定着重揭露池田拒绝执行中立政策
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天决定在目前正在举行的国会会议上，着重揭露池田拒绝执行中立政策，这是在社会党中央执行委员会审议了池田今天在国会所作的施政演说之后决定的。
    社会党认为，池田对中立政策的反对，明确表示他继承了岸信介的外交政策。
    社会党还决定要在竞选运动中着重提出中立政策问题，揭露池田企图拒绝中立政策，从而使日本更紧密地依附美国的政策。
    社会党的决定在谈到池田在他的施政演说中避而不谈修改宪法问题时说，没有迹象表明池田已经完全放弃肆意修改宪法的主张。决定说，因此党应该密切注意池田通过一系列的既成事实来阉割宪法条款的阴谋。
    社会党表示要坚决反对池田在演说中把右翼恐怖行为和人民的向国会请愿权、罢工权混为一谈的做法。
