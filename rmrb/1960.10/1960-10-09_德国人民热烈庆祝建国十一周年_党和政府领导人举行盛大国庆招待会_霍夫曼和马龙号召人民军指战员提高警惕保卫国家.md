Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th October: Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the State Council, Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl, and Professor Correns, Chairman of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany, held a grand reception tonight to celebrate the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.
    Among those present at the reception were prominent figures from all walks of life in the German Democratic Republic, diplomatic envoys of various countries to the German Democratic Republic and foreign guests, as well as generals and officers of the Soviet army stationed in the German Democratic Republic.
    Ulbricht delivered a speech at the reception. He first expressed his gratitude to the working people and intellectuals who have contributed to the construction of the Republic.
    Ulbricht said that the American ruling clique is unwilling to admit the changes that have taken place in the world. They use foreign military bases and the United Nations machinery to deceive themselves, as if they can still hold back the wheels of history for a long time. Even in Germany, the balance of power between the German Democratic Republic and the peaceful forces in West Germany on the one hand, and the militarists ruling our western part on the other, has also changed.
    Ulbricht said that our program of complete disarmament, subjugation of German militarism, and peaceful understanding between the two Germanys is completely in line with the demands and wishes of the majority of people in West Germany.
    Ulbricht said that the people of the German Democratic Republic have made great historical contributions to the whole of Germany. They have proved with their great construction achievements and clearly defined peaceful and democratic national policies and actions that the German Democratic Republic is the legitimate German state. Ulbricht said that the question now boils down to subduing aggressive American imperialism and its lackeys, and subduing the aggressive West German militarists and neo-Nazis by eliminating the remnants of World War II, to concluding a peace treaty with Germany, carrying out complete and thorough disarmament in the two Germanys, and establishing a demilitarized free city of West Berlin. He said that our struggle for peace in Germany is part of the worldwide struggle for peace.
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th October: People across the German Democratic Republic warmly celebrated the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the Republic today.
    This morning, Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the State Council, Otto Grotewohl, Deputy Chairman of the State Council and Prime Minister of the Council of Ministers, Johannes Dieckmann, Deputy Chairman of the State Council and Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber, Professor Correns, Chairman of the National Council of the National Front, and other party and state leaders, diplomatic missions of various countries stationed in Germany, and thousands of working people in Berlin laid wreaths at the Socialist Memorial Cemetery and the Soviet Martyrs Cemetery. Party and government leaders across the country also laid wreaths at the martyrs' cemeteries in various places.
    Minister of National Defense Hoffmann and Minister of the Interior Matern issued orders today respectively, ordering the commanders and fighters of the People's Army to heighten their vigilance and defend the country.
    At 4 p.m. today, a grand celebration was held in Marx-Engels Square in the democratic district of Berlin. Many temporary stages were set up in the square, where thousands of Berlin residents enjoyed the performances of artists.
    Workers in some enterprises continued to celebrate their festival with production achievements today. Workers at the "Unity" brown coal plant in Bitterfeld are still carrying out track relocation work during the festival to ensure that a new mining area can be mined in December.

    新华社柏林7日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记、国务委员会主席乌布利希、总理格罗提渥和民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席柯伦斯教授今晚举行盛大招待会，庆祝德意志民主共和国成立十一周年。
    出席招待会的有德意志民主共和国各界著名人士、各国驻德意志民主共和国的外交使节和外国客人，以及驻在德意志民主共和国的苏联军队的将领和军官。
    乌布利希在招待会上发表了讲话。他首先表示感谢为建设共和国贡献力量的劳动人民和知识分子。
    乌布利希说，美国统治集团不愿承认世界上已经发生的变化。他们用国外军事基地和联合国机器来欺骗自己，好像他们还能长久地阻挡历史车轮的前进。就是在德国，以德意志民主共和国和西德和平力量为一方与以统治我国西部的军国主义者为另一方这二者之间力量的对比也起了变化。
    乌布利希说，我们的全面裁军、制服德国军国主义与两个德国之间和平谅解的纲领是与西德大多数人的要求和愿望完全一致的。
    乌布利希说，德意志民主共和国的人民已经为整个德国作出了伟大的历史性的贡献。他们用他们的伟大的建设成就和目标明确的和平民主的民族政策和行动证明了德意志民主共和国是合法的德意志国家。乌布利希说，现在问题归结于制服侵略成性的美帝国主义及其喽罗们，和通过消除第二次世界大战的残迹来制服侵略成性的西德军国主义分子和新纳粹分子，在于缔结对德和约，在两个德国进行全面彻底裁军和建立一个非军事化的自由城市的西柏林。他说，我们为德国和平而进行的斗争是全世界争取和平斗争的一部分。
    新华社柏林7日电　德意志民主共和国全国各地人民今天热烈庆祝共和国成立十一周年。
    今天早晨，德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记、国务委员会主席乌布利希，国务委员会副主席、部长会议总理格罗提渥，国务委员会副主席、人民议院主席团主席狄克曼，全国阵线全国委员会主席柯伦斯及党和国家的其他领导人，各国驻德外交使团以及柏林成千劳动人民都到社会主义者纪念公墓和苏联烈士墓献了花圈。全国各地党政负责人也纷纷向各地烈士墓献花。
    国防部长霍夫曼和内务部长马龙今天分别发表命令，命令人民军指战员们提高警惕，保卫国家。
    今天下午四时，在柏林民主区的马克思—恩格斯广场举行了大联欢。广场上搭起了许多临时舞台，成千上万的柏林居民在这里欣赏了艺术家们的表演。
    一些企业的职工们今天继续以生产成绩来庆祝自己的节日。比特菲尔德“统一”褐煤厂的职工们为了保证一个新矿区能够在12月开采，在节日里仍在进行移轨工作。
