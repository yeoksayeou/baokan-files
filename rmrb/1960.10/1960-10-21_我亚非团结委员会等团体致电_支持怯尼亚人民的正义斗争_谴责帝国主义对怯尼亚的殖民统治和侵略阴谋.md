Xinhua News Agency, 20th. The China-Africa Solidarity Committee sent a telegram on the 19th to Oginga Odinga, Vice President of the Kenya African National Union, and the people of Kenya, expressing enthusiastic response to the call to hold a "Support Kenya Day," and paying high tribute to the Kenyan people who are bravely struggling against imperialism and colonialism for national independence.

The telegram said that imperialism and colonialism have long carried out brutal suppression and exploitation of the Kenyan people, committing countless heinous crimes. They also unreasonably imprisoned Jomo Kenyatta, the famous leader of the Kenyan and African national independence movement. Recently, with the support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization aggression group headed by US imperialism, the British colonialists are attempting to turn Kenya into their military base in order to strengthen the suppression of the national independence movement in Kenya and East and Central Africa. Imperialism also continues to undermine the unity of the Kenyan people and divide the various ethnic groups in Kenya in order to continue to maintain its criminal colonial rule.

The telegram said that the Chinese people strongly condemn the imperialist colonial rule and aggression conspiracy against Kenya, condemn the colonialist persecution of Kenyan patriots, and demand the immediate and unconditional restoration of Jomo Kenyatta's freedom. The 650 million Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and resolutely supported the just struggle of the Kenyan people against imperialism and colonialism for national independence. The Chinese people are willing to strengthen unity with the Kenyan people in the common struggle against imperialism, support each other, and move forward hand in hand.

The telegram finally wished the Kenyan people an early independence.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th. The Chinese-African People's Friendship Association today sent a telegram to the Kenya African National Union on "Kenya Day" in support of the heroic struggle of the Kenyan people for national independence.

The telegram said that the 650 million Chinese people firmly support the Kenyan people's unyielding just struggle against imperialism and colonialism for national independence, and will always stand with the Kenyan people. The Chinese people strongly protest against the British imperialists' barbaric suppression of Kenyan patriotic people and the continued exile of Kenyan people's leader Jomo Kenyatta; resolutely demand the immediate release of Jomo Kenyatta, the immediate withdrawal of all imperialist armed forces in Kenya, the abolition of all imperialist military bases on Kenyan land, resolutely demand that the colonialists return all the land they have seized to the Kenyan people, and resolutely demand that all imperialist forces get out of Kenya. We firmly believe that the Kenyan people will strengthen unity and persist in the struggle, and will surely achieve final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The All-China Youth Federation today sent a telegram to the Kenya African National Union on "Kenya Day" on October 20, extending their respects on behalf of all Chinese youth to the Kenyan people and youth who are bravely carrying out the struggle against imperialism for national independence, and expressing their full support for their just struggle.

The telegram said: "Chinese youth will always stand together with the Kenyan people and youth, and fully support your just struggle against the brutal suppression by the British colonial authorities, demanding the immediate removal of all imperialist troops and military bases in Kenya, and demanding the immediate release of Kenyan national leader Jomo Kenyatta."

The telegram said: "Recently, US imperialism, using the name of the United Nations, has invaded and interfered in the Congo, and its sinister activities of conspiring to drive Africans to fight Africans have not only further exposed the hideous face of US imperialism, the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, but also once again exposed the sinister face of the United Nations, which, under the manipulation of US imperialism, has shielded colonial countries from interfering in the independence movements of colonial peoples. At present, the storm of the world's people's struggle against imperialism and its lackeys is constantly rising, and they are encouraging and supporting each other, forming an unstoppable torrent. We believe that as long as the Kenyan people and youth continue to strengthen unity and persist in struggle, they will surely win final victory in the struggle against imperialism for national independence."

    我亚非团结委员会等团体致电
    支持怯尼亚人民的正义斗争
    谴责帝国主义对怯尼亚的殖民统治和侵略阴谋
    新华社20日讯　中国亚非团结委员会19日致电怯尼亚非洲民族联盟副主席奥廷加并怯尼亚人民，表示热烈响应举行“支持怯尼亚日”的号召，并向为反对帝国主义、殖民主义，为争取民族独立而英勇斗争的怯尼亚人民致以崇高的致意。
    电报说，帝国主义、殖民主义长期以来对怯尼亚人民进行了野蛮的镇压和剥削，犯下了无数的滔天罪行。他们还无理地囚禁了怯尼亚和非洲民族独立运动的著名领袖乔莫·肯雅塔。最近，英国殖民主义者在以美帝国主义为首的北大西洋公约侵略集团的支持下，为了加强对怯尼亚和东非中非民族独立运动的镇压，正企图将怯尼亚变成它的军事基地。帝国主义还不断破坏怯尼亚人民之间的团结，分裂怯尼亚各族人民，以便继续维持它罪恶的殖民统治。
    电报说，中国人民强烈谴责帝国主义对怯尼亚的殖民统治和侵略阴谋，谴责殖民主义迫害怯尼亚爱国人士的罪行，要求立即无条件恢复乔莫·肯雅塔的自由。六亿五千万中国人民一向深切同情和坚决支持怯尼亚人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义和争取民族独立的正义斗争。中国人民愿意与怯尼亚人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中加强团结，相互支持，携手前进。
    电报最后祝怯尼亚人民早日获得独立。
    新华社20日讯　中国非洲人民友好协会今天就“怯尼亚日”致电怯尼亚非洲民族联盟，支持怯尼亚人民为争取民族独立而进行的英勇斗争。
    电报说，六亿五千万中国人民坚决支持怯尼亚人民不屈不挠地向帝国主义、殖民主义进行争取民族独立的正义斗争，永远和怯尼亚人民站在一边。中国人民强烈抗议英帝国主义野蛮镇压怯尼亚爱国人民和继续流放怯尼亚人民领袖乔莫·肯雅塔的罪行；坚决要求立即释放乔莫·肯雅塔，立即撤出在怯尼亚的帝国主义一切武装力量，取消帝国主义在怯尼亚土地上的一切军事基地，坚决要求殖民主义者把所抢夺的全部土地归还怯尼亚人民，坚决要求一切帝国主义势力从怯尼亚滚出去。我们坚信，怯尼亚人民加强团结，坚持斗争，一定会取得最后胜利。
    新华社19日讯　中华全国青年联合会今天就10月20日“怯尼亚日”致电怯尼亚非洲民族联盟，代表全中国青年向正在英勇地进行反对帝国主义、争取民族独立斗争的怯尼亚人民和青年致敬，并表示全力支持他们的正义斗争。
    电报说：“中国青年永远同怯尼亚人民和青年站在一起，并且全力支持你们反对英国殖民当局残暴镇压，要求立即撤除帝国主义在怯尼亚的一切军队和军事基地，要求立即释放怯尼亚民族领袖乔莫·肯雅塔的正义斗争。”
    电报说：“最近美帝国主义利用联合国名义侵略和干涉刚果，阴谋驱使非洲人打非洲人的罪恶活动，不仅进一步暴露了美帝国主义这个全世界人民最凶恶敌人的狰狞面目，而且又一次暴露了联合国在美帝国主义操纵下包庇殖民国家干涉殖民地人民独立运动的罪恶面目。目前全世界人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴不断兴起，并且互相鼓舞、互相支持，形成了一支不可阻挡的洪流。我们相信，怯尼亚人民和青年只要继续加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够在反对帝国主义、争取民族独立的斗争中获得最后胜利。”
