Xinhua News Agency, October 26th. Momanki-Dunassian Felix, the head of the Congolese African Solidarity Party delegation currently visiting China, strongly condemned the activities carried out by U.S. imperialism in the Congo under the guise of the United Nations when he met with Xinhua reporters on the 25th. He said, "The Congolese people will never succumb to any foreign country; the plot to use the United Nations to invade the Congo cannot be realized unless all Congolese are killed."

Leader Momanki said, "The Congolese people's struggle to defend national independence is a just struggle, and defending national independence and safeguarding world peace are the legitimate rights of the Congolese people."

He continued, "The Congolese people have never invaded any other country; rather, it is imperialism that has invaded the Congo and imposed colonial rule on the Congolese people. The Congolese people love peace and do not approve of war, but if imperialism does not change its attitude of aggression towards the Congo, the Congolese people will wage a struggle against imperialism by means of armed struggle."

Leader Momanki said, "Although the imperialist army has superior equipment to ours, we are not afraid. We believe that even with primitive weapons, we can defeat imperialism because weapons are not the main factor determining the outcome of a war."

He said that the Congo does not have two or three governments as imperialism says, but only one Lumumba government, which represents the will of the people. The Congolese people's struggle has the support of the broad masses of peace-loving people. He especially mentioned that China has given the Congolese people great encouragement.

Leader Momanki said, "The United States' imperialism launches attacks and aggression against peace-loving people, and the result can only be its own decline. Ten years ago, U.S. imperialism launched the Korean War in an attempt to conquer China, but the result was the opposite of what it wanted."

Leader Momanki said that the imperialists once said that the Chinese people could not do anything, but in the ten years after liberation, China has achieved remarkable achievements and development. "We believe that China's achievements and development are historically significant events of this century and a miracle of this century. The victorious Chinese people are a model for the struggle of colonial peoples."

The Congolese African Solidarity Party delegation has been visiting China for more than two months. They visited industrial centers such as Anshan and Dalian in the Northeast and major cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan in the South. The delegation also visited many urban and rural people's communes in various places.

Leader Momanki said, "During our visits and stays in various parts of China, we have all noticed that the great Chinese people, contrary to what the imperialists say, are peace-loving people. They do not want to launch wars against any country, but they are subjected to all kinds of threats from imperialism."

He said, "The imperialists are carrying out all kinds of slanders against China, attempting to isolate China from the peace-loving people of the world, but judging from the frequent friendly exchanges between the Chinese people and the people of all countries, the imperialists' plot to isolate China cannot succeed."

Leader Momanki praised the people's commune as the most complete organizational form for China's socialist construction. He said that the production of many people's communes he visited was well organized, and the members knew for whom and why they were working. The collective welfare undertakings of the communes were well-run. The nursery and kindergarten caregivers loved and cared for the children in the nurseries and kindergartens as if they were their own. He especially mentioned a home for the elderly he visited in Zhengzhou, praising it for providing good living conditions for homeless elderly people. He said, "In China, we did not see unemployed people, but everywhere we saw smiling laborers."

    刚果非洲团结党代表团团长莫芒基发表谈话
    刚果人民决不向帝国主义侵略者屈服
    他说：中国的成就是本世纪奇迹，中国人民是殖民地人民斗争的榜样
    新华社26日讯　正在中国访问的刚果非洲团结党代表团团长莫芒基·杜纳西安·菲力斯25日接见新华社记者时，强烈谴责美帝国主义在联合国的招牌下在刚果所进行的活动。他说：“刚果人民决不屈服于任何外国；企图利用联合国侵入刚果的阴谋是不能实现的，除非把刚果人全部杀光。”
    莫芒基团长说：“刚果人民为保卫民族独立的斗争是正义的斗争，保卫民族独立和维护世界和平是刚果人民的正当的权力。”
    他接着说：“刚果人民从未侵略过任何别的国家，而是帝国主义侵略刚果，并把殖民统治强加在刚果人民的头上。刚果人民热爱和平，不赞成战争，但是，假如帝国主义不改变侵略刚果的态度，刚果人民将以武装斗争方式与帝国主义展开斗争。”
    莫芒基团长说：“尽管帝国主义军队有比我们优越的装备，我们也不惧怕。我们相信，即便用原始的武器，我们也能够战胜帝国主义，因为武器并不是决定战争胜负的主要因素”。
    他说，刚果不是像帝国主义所说的有两个或三个政府，刚果只有一个卢蒙巴政府，它代表着人民的意愿。刚果人民的斗争有着广大的爱好和平的人民的支援。他特别提到中国给予了刚果人民以巨大的鼓舞。
    莫芒基团长说：“美帝国主义向爱好和平的人民发动进攻和侵略，其结果只能使自己日趋没落。十年前，美帝国主义发动侵朝战争，企图征服中国，结果是事与愿违。”
    莫芒基团长说，帝国主义者曾经说中国人民什么事情也做不了，但是，中国在解放后的十多年，却取得了不起的成就和发展。“我们认为中国的成就和发展是本世纪有历史意义的事情，是本世纪的奇迹。胜利了的中国人民是殖民地人民斗争的榜样。”
    刚果非洲团结党代表团已经在中国进行了两个多月的参观访问。他们访问了东北的鞍山、大连等工业中心和南方的上海、南京、武汉等大城市。代表团在各地还访问了许多城乡人民公社。
    莫芒基团长说：“我们在中国各地访问、逗留期间，都注意到伟大的中国人民，与帝国主义者所说的相反，是热爱和平的人民。他们不想对任何国家发动战争，但是却遭到帝国主义的各种各样的威胁。”
    他说：“帝国主义者对中国进行种种诬蔑，企图把中国从世界爱好和平的人民中孤立起来，但是，从中国人民与各国人民频繁的友好往来这一事实看，帝国主义企图孤立中国的阴谋是不能得逞的。”
    莫芒基团长赞扬人民公社是中国进行社会主义建设最完整的组织形式。他说，他所访问的各地的许多人民公社的生产都组织得很好，社员们知道他们为谁和为什么进行劳动。公社的集体福利事业办得很好，托儿所和幼儿园的保育员，像对待自己的孩子一样，爱护照顾托儿所和幼儿园的孩子们。他特别提到他在郑州访问的一个公社敬老院，赞扬这个敬老院为无依无靠的老人提供了很好的生活条件。他说：“在中国我们没有看到失业的人，看到的是到处是笑逐颜开的劳动者。”
