Saving labor is of great significance. In social production activities, there are two kinds of savings. One is the saving of material consumption, and the other is the saving of labor. Increasing production and practicing economy is a basic principle of socialist enterprise management. Only by consuming less and creating more material wealth can we accumulate construction funds for the country. The saving of material consumption is certainly very important, but the saving of labor is even more important. Because labor creates everything, wasting labor is wasting materials; rationally using labor and improving production efficiency can create more wealth. The significance of saving labor is not just about spending a few yuan less in wages, but about developing production. Therefore, we must regard saving labor as a central link in the increase production and practice economy movement, and boldly mobilize the masses to raise questions and offer ideas. The Jiulonggang and Jigongpo coal mines, and the Wuhan Foundry, and other enterprises have done this, and have indeed saved a lot of manpower, and sent them to new places to create new wealth.

Saving labor is a constant task. Whether labor is used economically or not, reasonably or not, depends on the specific conditions. Yesterday, using hammers, files, shoulder poles, and manual pulling, using one hundred people may have been reasonable and economical; today, the material and technical conditions have changed, machines have replaced hammers and files, and vehicles have replaced carrying loads on shoulders, and using one hundred people becomes unreasonable and wasteful. All enterprises, institutions, and government offices must constantly improve labor organization and revise personnel quotas in accordance with the changed circumstances; they must actively compare themselves with units with roughly the same conditions, and not only learn from, catch up with, and surpass advanced units in terms of product quantity, quality, and cost, but also learn from advanced units in terms of labor use, and strive to promote advanced experiences and technologies, and improve the technical and business proficiency of employees. We must never use more people than necessary, never use full labor when part-time labor will suffice, and never occupy personnel prematurely when personnel increases can be delayed. In this way, we can accomplish as many things as possible with as little labor as possible, and we can constantly save batches of labor from existing enterprises and institutions and use them in the most urgently needed positions—to support agricultural production and support newly built enterprises.

    节约劳动力意义重大
    王朴
    节约劳动力意义重大。在社会生产活动中，有两种节约。一种是物质消耗的节约，一种是劳动力的节约。增产节约是社会主义企业管理的一个基本原则。只有少消耗而多创造物质财富，才能为国家积累建设基金。物质消耗的节约固然是非常重要的，但是劳动力的节约更为重要。因为劳动创造一切，浪费劳力就是浪费物质；合理使用劳力，提高生产效率，就能创造更多的财富。节约劳动力的意义，决不是为了少支出几元工资，而是为发展生产。所以，我们要把节约劳动力当做增产节约运动的一个中心环节，放手发动群众提问题，出主意。九龙岗、鸡公坡两个煤矿和武汉铸造厂等企业这样做了，果然节约了大量的人力，把他们派到了新的地方，创造新的财富。
    节约劳动力是一个经常性的任务。劳动力使用得节约不节约，合理不合理，要看具体条件。昨天用鎯头敲，用锉子锉，用肩挑，用手拉，使用一百个人可能是合理的、节约的；今天物质技术条件改变了，机器代替鎯头、锉子，车子代替了肩挑背扛，再用一百个人就变成不合理、浪费了。一切企业、事业机关，都要不断按照变化了的情况，改进劳动组织，修定人员定额；要主动跟条件大致相同的单位比一比，不仅要在产品数量、质量和成本方面向先进单位学习，赶它们，超它们，而且在劳动力的使用上面，也要向先进单位看齐，努力推广先进经验和技术，提高职工的技术和业务熟练程度。凡是可以少用人的决不多用，可以用半劳动力的决不用整劳动力，可以晚一点增加人员的决不过早占用人员。这样，才可以用尽可能少的劳动力办尽可能多的事，才可以不断地从现有企业、事业单位节约出成批的劳动力来，用到最迫切需要的岗位上——去支援农业生产，支援新建企业。
