Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, October 25th: The Zhengding Iron Works in Hebei Province conscientiously promotes the "quota contract" management system for coal and coke, saving a large amount of coal and coke. After the factory implemented "quota contracts" in September, the average total coke ratio for each ton of iron produced in small blast furnaces quickly dropped from 1.56 tons in August to 1.34 tons; the coke input ratio dropped from 0.98 tons in August to 0.91 tons. In just one month, 1,781 tons of coke were saved, ensuring that the pig iron production plan for September was overfulfilled by more than 1,500 tons, the pig iron qualification rate reached 91.12%, and costs were significantly reduced. From October 1st to 18th, the pig iron production plan was again overfulfilled, and the coke input ratio has been reduced to 0.89 tons.

    Setting production based on the furnace, setting coke based on production, quota contracts, implemented down to the individual
    The "quota contract" management system is a major measure taken by the Zhengding Iron Works for coal and coke management. Its main content is that the entire factory sets production based on the furnace, and sets coke based on production, that is, according to the planned output of each blast furnace (or coking furnace), coke (or coking coal) is allocated according to the quota and used under contract. Each furnace then breaks down the production tasks and the coke (or coal) allocated according to the tasks to each shift (group) on a daily basis. The quality and quantity of crushing are also specified for each coke crushing worker, requiring that processing losses be reduced to below 10%. In this way, the "quota contract" management system is implemented from the furnace, shift (group), all the way down to each worker, with a broad mass base. In the process of implementation, the factory Party committee also closely grasped the principles of "quota contracts, guaranteed supply, rewarding the advanced, and checking waste," ensuring the implementation of this system.

    Special personnel are responsible, coke is delivered to the furnace, focusing on both production and material usage
    More than a month of practice at the Zhengding Iron Works has proven that the "quota contract" management system is a good way to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in ironmaking production, and it has driven the in-depth development of enterprise management and mass movements. First, the implementation of the "quota contract" has promoted the comprehensive improvement of enterprise management, making management work more thorough and meticulous. In order to adapt to the development of "quota contract" management, the Party committee of this factory abolished the blast furnace workshop, and the Party organization secretary and factory director directly took charge of the blast furnace; thirty-seven cadres were transferred and assigned to furnaces and shifts (groups) to take on leadership work; each blast furnace was also equipped with a deputy furnace director, specializing in "quota contracts" and managing raw materials, and the raw material workshop's management of coke was changed to direct management of coke by the blast furnace, integrating ironmaking production and the use of raw materials, reversing the past phenomenon of blast furnaces focusing more on production and less on material usage. There have also been significant improvements in raw materials, planning, technical management, and grassroots accounting. In terms of furnace operation, responsibility systems have also been established for clean material yards, clean raw materials without powder, graded charging, and uniform distribution, achieving layer-by-layer defense, barrier-by-barrier checks, everyone checking, and special personnel being responsible. At the same time, regulations such as coke transportation losses not exceeding 5% and crushing losses not exceeding 10% have also been established. According to September accounting, coke losses before entering the furnace have been reduced from 36.5% in August to about 15%, ensuring that the blast furnace has enough to eat, greatly reducing the overall coke ratio for ironmaking.

    Rewarding savings, checking waste, everyone taking initiative, promoting innovation
    Secondly, the "quota contract" management system requires blast furnaces (or coking furnaces) to be responsible for coke (or coal) to the end. Within the allocated fuel quota, advanced consumption indicators are achieved, savings are rewarded, and waste is checked. Therefore, from the very first few days of its implementation, it has powerfully promoted the development of the technical revolution movement. From the offices and workshops to the workers in each group, the entire factory has been carrying out innovation and creation, and promoting advanced experiences, focusing on reducing coke ratios, saving coke, and increasing pig iron production. The technical revolution movement has been very successful among ironmaking workers in reducing the coke input ratio. In early September, furnace operator Wang Muyao and technical cadre Liu Shou Zeng proposed appropriately extending the blowing time after tapping iron and shortening the tapping time, which lowered the furnace top temperature and increased the furnace hearth temperature, thoroughly solving key problems that had not been well resolved in the past. Due to the implementation of a large number of innovation projects, the coke input ratio of the entire factory has been significantly reduced.

    Daily accounting, regular evaluation, large-scale competition, saving even more
    Thirdly, because the quota is implemented to the furnace (group) and individual, each employee has a clear understanding of each indicator and a direction for their efforts, which fully mobilizes the enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees and promotes the in-depth development of the evaluation and competition movement. The factory has also stipulated a three-level accounting system for shifts (groups), daily accounting, shift-by-shift accounting, and insists on small evaluations every day, summaries every five days, large evaluations every ten days, and rewards every month, achieving furnace protection through shifts, factory protection through furnaces, day protection through ten-day periods, and month protection through ten-day periods. The evaluation and competition organization is more thorough and meticulous than in the past, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees is growing stronger and stronger. Since October, in the competitions and evaluations among furnaces, shifts, groups, and individuals, such as opponent competitions, counterpart competitions, and collaboration competitions, the coke ratio of 80% of the ironmaking groups has been reduced to about 0.85 tons, and more than 400 advanced workers have appeared on the savings honor roll. The evaluation and competition between the factory's model furnaces—No. 8 and No. 9—is even more heated. They compare furnace to furnace, compare at all times. When one furnace taps iron, the workers of the other furnace come to watch, looking at how much iron is tapped, the tapping time, how many batches of materials are charged, and how large the load is, learning advanced operating methods and striving to be the first. At the same time, the "quota contract" is a mass line for managing fuel. It not only effectively improves management work, but also enables each employee to better establish the idea of "cherishing coke like grain" through participating in management, and paying attention to every bit of saving has become the norm, and the sense of responsibility of employees has been greatly enhanced. Employees in all processes of the entire factory have changed their past extravagant style, ensuring that no coke or coal is lost on the road, that the carts do not crush coke, using spare time to screen small coke, and using inferior coal to make coke, and inferior coke to replace good coke. Therefore, since September, the coke utilization rate has increased by 10% compared to the past.

    正定铁厂推行煤焦定额包干管理制度
    调动各方积极性少用焦多炼铁
    小高炉全焦比入炉焦比逐月下降“爱焦如爱粮”点滴节约形成风气
    据新华社石家庄25日电　河北省正定炼铁厂认真推行煤、焦“定额包干”管理制度，节约了大量煤和焦炭。这个厂9月份实行“定额包干”以后，小高炉平均每炼一吨铁的全焦比很快由8月份的一点五六吨，下降到一点三四吨；入炉焦比由8月份的零点九八吨，下降到零点九一吨。短短一个月时间，就节约焦炭一千七百八十一吨，从而保证了9月份超额一千五百多吨完成了生铁生产计划，生铁合格率达到91.12％，成本也显著降低。10月份1至18日又超额完成了生铁生产计划，入炉焦比已经降到零点八九吨。
    以炉定产，以产定焦，定额包干，落实到人
    “定额包干”管理制度，是正定炼铁厂对煤、焦管理所采取的一项重大措施。它的主要内容是全厂以炉定产，以产定焦，即根据每座高炉（或炼焦炉）预定产量计划，按定额调拨焦炭（或炼焦煤），包干使用。每座炉子又逐日把生产任务和按任务分配的焦炭（或煤）落实到班（组）。对每个焦炭破碎工人，也规定了破碎的质量、数量，要求加工损耗降低到10％以下。这样，“定额包干”管理制度就从炉、班（组），一直落实到每个工人，有了广泛的群众基础。在推行中，工厂党委还紧紧掌握了“定额包干，保证供应，奖励先进，检查浪费”等原则，保证了这一制度的贯彻执行。
    专人负责，焦炭到炉，既抓生产，也抓用料
    正定炼铁厂一个多月的实践证明，“定额包干”管理制度是实现炼铁生产全面跃进的一项好办法，并且带动了企业管理工作和群众运动的深入开展。首先，实行“定额包干”以后，促进了企业管理工作的全面提高，管理工作做得更加深入细致。这个工厂的党委为适应“定额包干”管理工作的开展，撤销了高炉车间这一机构，党组织书记、厂长直接抓高炉；调出三十七名干部，分配到炉、班（组）担任领导工作；每座高炉还配备了一名副炉长，专门抓“定额包干”，管理原料，并且把原料车间管焦炭，改为高炉直接管焦炭，使炼铁生产和使用原料结成一体，扭转了过去高炉管生产多、抓用料少的现象。在原料、计划、技术管理和基层核算工作等方面也都有显著改进。炉前操作方面，也建立了料场清洁，原料干净不带粉末，分级入炉、布料匀均等责任制，做到层层设防，关关设卡，人人检查，专人负责。同时，还规定焦炭运输损耗不超过5％，破碎损耗不大于10％等制度。据9月份核算，全厂入炉前焦炭损耗已经由8月份的36.5％降低到15％左右，保证了高炉吃饱有余，使炼铁全焦比大大降低。
    奖励节约，检查浪费，人人主动，推动革新
    其次，“定额包干”管理制度，要求高炉（或炼焦炉）用焦（或煤）一包到底，在分配的燃料定额内，实现先进的消耗指标，节约了奖励，浪费了检查。因此，从它最初实行的几天起，就有力地推动了技术革命运动的开展。全厂从科室、车间到每个小组的工人，都以降低焦比、节约焦炭、增产生铁为中心，大搞革新、创造，推广先进经验。炼铁工人在降低入炉焦比方面，技术革命运动搞得很出色。9月上旬，炉前工王慕尧和技术干部刘寿增提出适当延长出铁水以后的喷吹时间和缩短出铁时间的建议，降低了炉顶温度，提高了炉缸温度，使得过去没有很好解决的关键问题得到彻底解决。由于大批革新项目的实现，全厂入炉焦比显著降低。
    天天核算，定期评比，大搞竞赛，省了再省
    第三，由于定额落实到炉（组）和人，每个职工对每项指标都心中有数和有努力方向，这就充分调动了广大职工的积极性，促进了评比竞赛运动的深入开展。这个厂还规定了班（组）三级核算制，天天核算、班班核算，并坚持一日一小评，五天一总结，十天大评比，一月一奖励，做到了以班保炉，以炉保厂，以日保旬，以旬保月，评比竞赛组织得比以往更加周密细致，广大职工劲头越来越足。10月份以来，这个厂在炉与炉、班与班、组与组、人与人的对手赛、对口赛、协作赛等竞赛评比中，有80％的炼铁小组焦比降到零点八五吨左右，有四百多名先进工人登上节约光荣榜。全厂标兵炉——八号炉和九号炉的评比竞赛搞得更加热火朝天。他们炉炉比、时时比、这个炉出铁那个炉工人就来看，看出铁多少，看出铁时间，看料批多少，负荷多大，学习先进的操作方法，力争第一。同时，“定额包干”是一条管理燃料的群众路线，它不仅有效地改进了管理工作，而且使每个职工从参加管理中更好地树立起“爱焦如粮”的思想，讲求点滴节约已经成为风气，职工的责任感大大增强。全厂各个工序职工都改变了过去大手大脚的作风，做到路上不丢焦、煤，车子不压焦，利用业余时间筛小焦炭，用次煤炼焦，次焦代好焦。因此，9月份以来焦炭利用率已经比过去提高10％。
