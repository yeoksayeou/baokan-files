    Chen Wantang - A Good Pioneer of the Steel Commander
    By Our Reporters Hu Mingjun and Yang Yaoxuan, Cadres of Chongqing Automobile Transportation Company
    Chen Wantang is a driver at the Chongqing Automobile Transportation Company. Since the Great Leap Forward, he has been responsible for transporting steel raw materials, traveling across the Kangzang Plateau, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, and the towering mountains of Sichuan. No matter how bad the weather, how high the mountains, or how rugged the roads, he always raced against time, overcame difficulties, and repeatedly achieved excellent results. In 1953, Chen Wantang raised the banner of high production among automobile workers in Sichuan Province with an achievement of three to four thousand ton-kilometers per month. Subsequently, he continued to leap forward year after year, quarter after quarter, raising the monthly ton-kilometer record to five thousand, ten thousand, twenty thousand, thirty thousand, and reaching fifty thousand ton-kilometers at the beginning of this year. Since the second quarter of this year, he has further improved transportation methods, significantly increased transportation efficiency, and created achievements dozens of times higher than the initial record.
  　Chen Wantang's indomitable will against all dangers and difficulties, his spirit of continuous revolution and innovation, and his noble communist style have become a model for transportation workers throughout Sichuan Province. From automobiles to trains, from ships to wooden boats, thousands upon thousands of transportation workers are launching a movement to learn from Chen Wantang.
    Here, we will tell a few stories about him.
              Not Afraid of Hardship
    One afternoon in July this year, the sky was covered with dark clouds, it was raining heavily, and lightning flashed.
    In a restaurant in a small town on the Sichuan-Chongqing Highway, a large group of car drivers were eating and complaining about the weather.
    "The heavens are really messing around. The task of transporting steel is so urgent, but the annoying rain is getting heavier and heavier."
    "The roadbeds and bridges are bound to be washed away. The Dragon King has trapped us!"
    "Even if they aren't washed away, it's hard to travel in such heavy thunderstorms."
    Among the crowd, a burly young man remained silent. After finishing his meal, he said to a few young men at the same table, "The Steel Commander is in urgent need of 'supplies'. Are the pioneers going or not?"
      "Team leader, every second counts, we have to go even if it hails!"
    The young man called the team leader was Chen Wantang. He nodded and smiled at his team members' responses, then got up, left the restaurant, and got into his car.
    Seeing that Chen Wantang's team, pulling a long line of trailers, had left, the hesitant drivers also mustered the courage to follow.
    This section of the mountainous branch road followed the mountains and rivers, with steep slopes and sharp turns. In heavy rain, the road was full of potholes and difficult to navigate. The convoy had only traveled about twenty miles when the leading car suddenly stopped. It turned out that a large area of ​​cliff rocks had collapsed, completely blocking the road.
    Chen Wantang jumped out of the car to check and resolutely said, "Pioneers must open roads through mountains and build bridges over water. Shall we all work together?"
    "Yes, let's all work together!" The drivers rushed forward and, in the pouring rain, overturned countless thousand-pound stones and rolled them into the river.
    An hour or so later, the cars roared and moved forward again.
    In the evening, they drove to a bridge and encountered another unexpected obstacle: the bridge had been washed away by the flood. A newly built temporary bridge stood next to it, but on a path leading to the temporary bridge, two cars were stuck in mud more than a foot deep, blocking the way. On both sides of the temporary bridge, dozens of cars transporting iron and grain were lined up in a long, dense queue.
    Seeing so many cars blocked here, Chen Wantang was very anxious. He immediately jumped into the mud with his partners, shoveled away the mud that had trapped the wheels, and used his own truck to pull with full power. The slope was steep and the mud was deep, and it took a great deal of effort to move it. Chen Wantang stopped and said to his partners, "It looks like we have to use the method of 'casting a long line to catch a big fish'." The partners understood and immediately brought a steel cable. Chen Wantang drove the car over the steep slope to a flat road, tied one end of the rope to the truck and the other end to the stuck car. Chen Wantang started again with full power, and the stuck car slowly moved.
    The road was clear, but Chen Wantang did not rush to leave. He and his partners went back and forth to help dozens of cars parked on both sides of the temporary bridge to cross the bridge one by one.
    Chen Wantang and his partners overcame the obstacles brought to driving by the heavy thunderstorms and drove the train loaded with pig iron to its destination.
    Cleverly Climbing High Mountains
    Once, Chen Wantang's driving team accepted a transportation task to Jiao Ding Mountain, which is more than 3,800 meters above sea level.
    No cargo trucks had ever been driven to the top of Jiao Ding Mountain before. They came to Jiao Ding Mountain to explore the road and couldn't help but be secretly surprised. The mountain peaks were steep and plunged into the clouds, the summit was covered with snow all year round, and it was often shrouded in thick fog. Before people climbed halfway up the mountain, the sea of clouds was already floating under their feet. A narrow 68-kilometer-long road was like a ten-thousand-zhang long snake, hugging the mountains and winding its way to the summit. Next to the road was an abyss with no bottom in sight.
    The first trial run was chosen on a clear, fog-free afternoon. Chen Wantang led the way in front, and everyone followed one after another. The thawing mud road was elastic like rubber, and the car moved with a jerky, limping motion. The trailer shook even more violently.
    The climate in the high mountains changed rapidly. Before they reached halfway up the mountain, the sky suddenly began to snow heavily, followed by a vast fog, making the convoy's progress even more difficult. In a place with sharp turns and steep slopes, the four wheels of Chen Wantang's car suddenly spun rapidly, the snow and mud on the ground flew straight up, and the car was slightly reversing, with a bottomless abyss below! Seeing the emergency, the team members behind immediately braked and jumped down to help Chen Wantang push forward, stabilizing the car.
    When encountering difficulties, Chen Wantang always consulted with everyone. After discussing with everyone, he decided to adopt the method of "casting a long line to catch a big fish," using a steel cable to drag the trailer up the steep and slippery slope.
    Not far from the top of the mountain, the mining captain arrived with a large team of people. They said with excitement: No cars have ever come to this mountaintop. We have to carry the ore down more than ten kilometers to load the trucks. It's great that you're here! As they spoke, the miners helped Chen Wantang and his team push the cars. It was already late at night when they reached the top of the mountain.
    Originally, Chen Wantang and his team could have stayed on the mountain overnight before going down. In order to save time, as soon as the car was loaded, they hurriedly started off in the dark. People who often walk mountain roads know that on slippery and dangerous roads, going downhill is much more difficult than going uphill. The more difficult it was, the more cautious and careful they were. When encountering sharp turns, someone would get out to direct, and the drivers would concentrate even more on operating. Every five or six kilometers, everyone would come down to exchange driving experience.
    In this way, they finally successfully completed this difficult driving task.
            Wholeheartedly for the Collective
    One clear morning, convoys of cars loaded with pig iron and grain were speeding through the mountains of the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway.
    Chen Wantang, who was responsible for rushing the pig iron, was driving towards Guizhou. Seeing a car parked next to the road in the distance, he thought: Could this car have a problem? In order to complete the busy task of transporting grain and steel, he should help him quickly repair his "weapon."
    When Chen Wantang drove his car close to the car, a driver was repairing the car, his head covered in sweat. After a careful look, it turned out to be Master Zhang from his company.
      "Is the car fixed? What's the problem?"
      "I've been checking for a long time, but I still can't fix it." Master Zhang said anxiously when he saw Chen Wantang, "I'm going to report to the company for help!"
    Although Chen Wantang knew that his task was very urgent, he still regarded other people's difficulties as his own, and hurriedly climbed into Master Zhang's car to help check. After a detailed inspection and finding the problem, he smiled and said to Master Zhang, "It's okay, I'll fix it. You drive my car away!"
    "No, if you give me your car, what will you do?"
    "Transporting iron is important, we must race against time." Chen Wantang explained, "If the two of us are stopped here to repair, wouldn't it be a waste of time for my car to be idle? You drive my car away, and I'll drive your car back to Chongqing as soon as I fix it. This way, we can all complete the task."
    "If you can't fix it, won't you be tired!" Master Zhang said embarrassedly.
    "Hurry up and go!" Chen Wantang made a decisive gesture.
    Master Zhang was deeply moved by Chen Wantang's communist style of selflessness and had to jump into Chen Wantang's car and drive away.
    After a lot of hard work, Chen Wantang finally drove the car loaded with pig iron smoothly back to Chongqing.

    陈万堂——钢帅的好先行
    本报记者　胡明俊　重庆市汽车运输公司干部　杨耀萱
    陈万堂是重庆市汽车运输公司的司机。大跃进以来，他一直担负着运送钢铁原料的任务，奔驰在康藏高原、云贵高原和四川的丛山峻岭中。不管天气怎么坏，山多么高，道路多么崎岖险阻，他总是争分夺秒，战胜困难挺身前进，并且一次又一次地创造了优异的成绩。1953年，陈万堂曾以月产三千、四千吨公里的成就，在四川省汽车工人中树起了高产的红旗。接着年年跃进，季季高升，把月产吨公里的纪录提高到五千、一万、两万、三万，今年年初便达到五万吨公里。今年第二季度以来，他更进一步改进运输方法，大幅度提高运输效率，创造了比最初的纪录高出几十倍的成绩。
  　陈万堂的不畏一切险阻艰难的顽强意志，不断革命，不断创造的精神和高尚的共产主义风格，已经成为四川全省交通运输职工的学习榜样。从汽车到火车，从轮船到木船，千千万万的运输工人，正在掀起一个学习陈万堂的运动。
    这里，我们讲几段关于他的故事。
              不畏艰险
    今年7月的一个下午，天空黑云滚滚，大雨如注，雷电交加。
    四川汉渝公路上一个小镇的饭店里，大群汽车驾驶员边吃饭，边七嘴八舌地抱怨天气。
    “老天爷真捣蛋，运铁任务这么急，讨厌的雨偏偏越下越起劲。”
    “路基、桥梁准冲垮了。龙王爷把我们困住了！”
    “就不冲垮，这样大雷雨天也难走嘛。”
    人群中，一个身材魁梧的青年人默不做声。吃完了饭，他才对同桌的几个小伙子说：“钢帅急着要‘粮草’，先行官们走不走？”
      “组长，分秒必争，下冰雹也得走！”
    这个被称作组长的年青人就是陈万堂。他听了组员们的回答，点头笑笑，便起身出了店门，上了车。
    看到拖着长列挂车的陈万堂小组都走了，那些迟疑不决的驾驶员们也鼓起勇气跟了上来。
    这段山区支路依山傍河，坡大弯急，在滂沱大雨天，路上坑坑洼洼，艰险难行。车队刚走二十来里，前面的车突然停了，原来是大片崖石倒坍下来，把路全堵死了。
    陈万堂跳下车来查看一阵，便毅然地说：“先行官要逢山开道，遇水搭桥。大伙一齐动手，好吗？”
    “对，大家动手！”驾驶员们一拥而上，在倾盆大雨中，把无数块千斤大石，连翻带滚地掀入江中。
    个把钟头以后，汽车又呜呜叫着向前开动了。
    傍晚，他们开到一座桥边，又碰到意外障碍：大桥被洪水冲垮了，旁边新修了一座便桥，通便桥的一条便道上，两辆汽车陷进一尺多深的泥沼里，挡住了去路。便桥两边，几十辆运铁、运粮的汽车，黑压压地摆了一长串。
    看到这么多车阻塞在这里，陈万堂十分着急。他立刻同伙伴们跳进泥坑，铲开陷住车轮的泥巴，用自己的大卡车开足马力拖。坡道大，泥沼深，费了九牛二虎之力也拖不动。陈万堂停了停，对伙伴们说：“看样子，非用放长线钓大鱼的办法不行。”伙伴们会意，即刻拿来钢丝绳，等陈万堂把车开到越过陡坡的平路，把绳的一端系在大卡车上，另一端系在被陷的车上。陈万堂再度开足马力，陷住的汽车便缓缓蠕动了。
    路通了，陈万堂却没有立即赶路。他和伙伴们又来来回回帮助停在便桥两边的几十辆汽车一辆一辆地开过桥去。
    陈万堂和他的伙伴们战胜了大雷雨天给行车带来的重重障碍，把满载生铁的列车开到了目的地。巧爬高山
    有一次，陈万堂行车小组接受了一项到拔海三千八百多米的轿顶山去的运输任务。
    轿顶山顶，过去没有开过运货卡车。他们来到轿顶山探看道路，不禁暗暗吃惊。山峰壁陡入云，山顶终年积雪，经常笼罩着茫茫大雾，人还没爬到半山腰，云海早已在脚下浮动。一条六十八公里长的狭窄公路像万丈长蛇，抱着山岭千回百折，直到峰顶。公路旁边是一眼望不到底的深渊。
    首次试行，选在一个晴朗无雾的下午。陈万堂在前领路，大家鱼贯而行。化雪以后的翻浆路像橡皮似地带着弹性，车子走起来一颠一跛的，拖车更摇晃得厉害。
    高山的气候瞬息万变。他们还没到半山，天空忽然飘起鹅毛大雪，接着撒下茫茫大雾，车队前进更艰难了。在一个弯急坡大的地方，陈万堂驾驶的车子四个车轮猛然哗哗打转，地上的雪和泥直往上飞，车子在微微倒退，下面便是千丈深渊！后边的队员们一见形势紧急，立刻刹住车，跳下来帮助陈万堂向前狠推，才把车稳住。
    遇到困难，陈万堂总是同大家商量。他同大伙研究以后，决定采取“放长线钓大鱼”的办法，用钢丝绳把拖车拖上陡滑的坡道。
    离山顶不远，采矿队长带了大队人马赶来。他们眉飞色舞地说：这山顶上从没来过汽车。我们要把矿石背下十多公里地去装车。你们一来可就好了！矿工们一边说，一边帮助陈万堂他们推车。到达山顶，已经是深夜了。
    本来，陈万堂他们可以在山上住一夜再下山。为了争取时间，车一装好，他们又急忙摸着黑路启程了。常走山路的人都知道，滑坡险道地方，下坡比上坡还艰难得多。越艰险，他们就越谨慎小心。碰到急转弯，都有人下来指挥，驾驶的人更聚精会神地操纵。每走五、六公里，大家便下来交流一次行车经验。
    就这样，他们终于顺利地完成了这种艰难的行车任务。
            一心为集体
    一个晴朗的上午，满载着生铁、粮食的车群，在川黔公路的丛山中奔驰着。
    担负着赶运生铁任务的陈万堂，正驾驶汽车向贵州进发。远远望见公路旁边停着一辆车子，他想：莫非这辆车子出了毛病？为了完成繁忙的粮、钢运输任务，应该帮助他赶快把“武器”修好。
    陈万堂把汽车开近这辆车子的时候，一个驾驶员冒着满头大汗，正在检修车子。仔细一看，原来是本公司的张师傅。
      “车子可修好了？毛病在哪儿？”
      “检查了半天，还是修不好。”张师傅一见陈万堂就急着说，“准备向公司报告求援哩！”
    陈万堂虽然知道自己的任务很急，但他还是把别人的困难当作自己的困难，急忙爬到张师傅的车上帮助检查。经过详细检查，发现毛病以后，他便笑着对张师傅说：“不要紧，我来修。你把我的车开走！”
    “不行，你把车给我开走了，你怎么办？”
    “运铁要紧，我们要争分夺秒。”陈万堂解释说，“如果我们两个都停在这里修，我那个车子闲着，岂不是浪费时间？你把我的车开走，我把你的车修好以后马上开回重庆。这样，我们大家都能完成任务。”
    “如果修不好，不累了你！”张师傅为难地说。
    “你快走吧！”陈万堂作了一个断然的手势。
    张师傅深深为陈万堂这种舍己为人的共产主义风格所感动，只好跳上陈万堂的车子开着走了。
    陈万堂经过一番苦心修理，终于把这辆满载生铁的汽车顺利地开回重庆。（附图片）
