    Carrying Forward the Glorious Tradition of Hard Struggle in Nanniwan
    Production Troops of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps' Mosuowan Reclamation Area Establish a New Grain and Cotton Base
    The production troops of the Mosuowan Reclamation Area of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, carrying forward the glorious tradition of Nanniwan, have worked hard and established a new grain and cotton base in the Junggar Basin.
    Mosuowan is located in the hinterland of the Junggar Basin and is a fertile wasteland full of thorns. For many years, the people of all ethnic groups in the Junggar Basin have been unable to realize their desire for development due to their inability to control drought. In 1958, the various military reclamation farms of the Manas Reclamation Area of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps organized a strong production force, led by many veteran soldiers who had participated in the development of Nanniwan and Jinpenwan, to enter the hinterland of the basin and launch the great undertaking of conquering Mosuowan.
    One severe winter, seven commanders and fighters of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps of the People's Liberation Army, carrying five gasoline barrels of water, a tent, a pot, a kitchen knife, and some flour, set off by car from the Shihezi Reclamation Area to the hinterland of the Junggar Basin. When they arrived in Mosuowan, they were greeted by an endless, snow-covered primitive Haloxylon forest. They set up their tent in the Haloxylon forest, lit a bonfire, and began to prepare for the construction of the first military reclamation farm – Mosuowan Second Farm. Leading this vanguard was Xiao Fengrui, the farm manager and political commissar, who had been wounded seven times in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation and had participated in the great production movement in Jinpenwan, northern Shaanxi. Xiao Fengrui and the soldiers got up in the morning, took dry rations, and surveyed the farm site in the thickets. When they returned in the evening, each person carried a bundle of Haloxylon firewood for warmth and cooking. After they completed the planning, more than a thousand lightly equipped military reclamation fighters were transferred in, and the battle to develop Mosuowan officially began. This was at the beginning of 1958, only two years and ten months ago. Recently, when we came here, there was no trace of desolation. Flat wilderness everywhere with crisscrossing channels, sparkling water, large pieces of farmland stretching to the distant horizon, tractors sowing winter wheat roaring in the fields, corn cobs being harvested were as long as half a foot, cotton fields were covered with white cotton bolls. Newly planted forest belts were already tree-lined avenues, and large pumpkins were lying densely in the forest belts, and two rows of sunflowers nodded in the wind. Through the gaps in the forest belt, there were melon fields with watermelons and cantaloupes hanging heavily, and vegetable gardens with branches full of tomatoes and peppers. Trucks carrying grain and vegetables were constantly driving out of here. In two and a half years, Mosuowan Second Farm has handed over 30 million catties of marketable grain and 8.89 million catties of cotton to the state.
    Mosuowan is a fertile and flat wasteland in the hinterland of the Junggar Basin, but it is rainless throughout the year except for some snow in winter. For many years, farmers of all ethnic groups on the edge of the basin wanted to develop it, but they all failed because they could not control the drought. When the military reclamation fighters of the People's Liberation Army came to Mosuowan, they could not find a drop of water. At first, they went to the Manas River, more than 40 kilometers away, to fetch ice and melt it into water. One car could only make one trip a day, and the cost of one car of ice was as high as 40 yuan, which not only could not completely solve the problem of drinking water, but also increased the construction cost of the farm. The soldiers then dug wells to find water. But in the dry wasteland, they could not see any wet soil even after digging more than ten meters. Sometimes a little water seeped out of the bottom of the well, but it was bitter water that could not be swallowed. Just then, Mosuowan had a snowfall, and the soldiers made scrapers overnight to collect all the snow on the ground. After that, they collected it every time it snowed. Each catering unit piled up many snow piles in the open air, and even thin ice like paper melted on the ground was collected cleanly. In order to store the snow for a long time, they tied Haloxylon firewood into walls in the southeast direction facing the sun, covered them with wheat straw, and blocked the sunlight. When the cooks cooked, they used buckets to scoop the snow into the pot and then melt it into water. In those days, from the farm manager to the soldiers, each person used a teacup of water a day to wash their face and brush their teeth, and the water used to wash their face in the morning was collected and used to wash their feet at night and wash their clothes. In this way, they maintained their lives by melting snow into water in this isolated area for four months, and insisted on building water conservancy projects and reclaiming wasteland.
    When the military reclamation fighters were building canals and reclaiming wasteland in the wilderness, it was the severe winter of minus forty degrees. During the day, there was wind and snow, and at night, the cold wind was biting. Because there was no forage grass in Mosuowan, the soldiers did not bring a horse when they came. Now, all transportation on the canal construction site had to be carried by people on their backs and shoulders. In the early spring when the ice and snow were melting, the mud and snow blocked the roads, and transportation was cut off, and the supply of vegetables and other non-staple foods was interrupted. At this difficult moment, the cadres shared the joys and sorrows with the soldiers like they did in the past on the battlefield, and took the lead in overcoming difficulties. In order to keep everyone from freezing at night, the old soldiers took their cotton quilts to make door curtains for the tents; many squad leaders stayed up all night to keep the fire burning in the tents for the soldiers to keep warm; although Farm Manager Xiao Fengrui had difficulty walking due to a leg injury, he dug canals and carried soil with the soldiers every day. When he received a cold wave warning at night, he walked to the various companies to tell the soldiers to wear more clothes when they went to work the next day. This valuable style of the old soldiers added to the courage of the soldiers to overcome difficulties. The soldiers' faces were cracked from the cold, and their hands were swollen from the cold, but no one complained. When there was no vegetables to eat, they took steamed buns and ate them with salt. When the steamed buns were sent to the construction site, they were frozen hard. They stuffed them into their arms to warm them before eating. The soldiers said: No matter how cold the weather is, it cannot freeze the hearts of the people's soldiers; no matter how cold the wind is, it cannot stop our construction. They fought hard in the ice and snow for more than three months and built a main canal and irrigation channels with a total length of 173 kilometers. When the canals were built, but there was no cement or wood for the drops and sluice gates, the soldiers used Haloxylon firewood and red willow roots instead. When the buildings on the canal were completed, the weathered dry soil in the wilderness was very loose, and there were ground burrows and rat holes everywhere. As soon as water flowed into the canal, the main canal breached everywhere. When the watering soldiers walked in the leveled fields, sometimes they suddenly fell into the ground burrows with their tools. In order to seize the opportunity for spring sowing, the soldiers stayed on the banks of the canals and in the fields day and night. In the early spring when it was still freezing in the morning and evening, wherever there was a breach, the soldiers jumped into the yellow, rolling ice water to fight, plugging wherever there was a breach. When some soldiers saw that the canal was punctured, they immediately took off their cotton-padded jackets and coats and stuffed them in, and then filled them with soil. In order to prevent falling into the ground burrows when watering, the soldiers came up with the idea of ​​tying wooden boards. When watering, each person carried a wooden board horizontally on their waist, so that they could get out by themselves if they fell down. In this way, the soldiers overcame one difficulty after another, and finally introduced the water from the Manas River into the fields, and in that year they sowed more than 13,000 mu of spring-sown crops such as grain, vegetables, oil crops, and cotton. After these crops were sown, they had vegetables to eat, livestock had fodder, and in the autumn, the grain not only reached self-sufficiency, but also had a surplus to hand over. More importantly, after they established a foothold in Mosuowan as a vanguard force, they created conditions for large-scale development of Mosuowan. In the second half of that year, six military reclamation farms were built here at once.
    After the soldiers of Mosuowan Second Farm built the farm, they tried every means to use their labor to expand the cultivated area and increase the production of grain and cotton every year. In the first year, they won the State Council's award for reclaiming wasteland, producing in the same year, and being profitable in the same year. Last year, they leaped to expand the sown area by nearly ten times to 120,000 mu. After deducting rations, seeds, and feed from grain production, 12 million catties of marketable grain were handed over to the state. This year, the soldiers expanded the sown area by 47% without increasing manpower and machinery. Each soldier managing wheat managed an average of more than 100 mu, and those managing cotton managed more than 50 mu. The soldiers not only managed well, but also achieved high yields in everything. During the spring plowing season this year, more than 80,000 mu of spring-sown crops had to be sown by seizing moisture, and 70,000 mu of winter wheat had to be harrowed at the same time to preserve moisture. According to the actual amount of machinery and manpower, it was impossible to take care of both. As a result, the cadres and soldiers went to the fields together to use human-drawn harrows and rakes, in conjunction with a small number of machines, and finished harrowing 70,000 mu of winter wheat in three days and three nights. Due to timely moisture preservation, disasters were avoided this year, and large-scale high yields were achieved. During the summer harvest, the management of autumn fields and more than 40,000 mu of cotton was intertwined with the wheat harvest, and the actual strength of the machinery could only harvest half of it at most. The soldiers launched a vigorous high-efficiency movement, and they created amazing high records in hard work and clever work. Many soldiers used sickles to cut more than 20 mu of wheat a day. Jiang Guifang, a female soldier who could work hard and cleverly in every farm work, helped many comrades improve their skills, and increased the efficiency of bundling wheat from several hundred bundles to three thousand bundles. After she developed the waist-pulling method of bundling wheat, her daily bundling record increased from five or six thousand bundles to 14,000 bundles. It was these hundreds and thousands of heroic soldiers who snatched 70,000 mu of high-yield winter wheat back from the annual wind disasters and returned it to their homes on time. This year, the average yield of wheat per mu was 320 catties. After one season of wheat harvest was enough to cover the whole year's self-sufficiency, another 18 million catties can be handed over to the state. Now is the busy time for autumn harvest and autumn sowing. According to their actual machinery and manpower, they currently need to increase 50,000 laborers to complete the task on time. But they did not ask the higher authorities for difficulties or manpower. Their solution is to tap the potential of machinery and carry out a high-efficiency movement of one machine and manpower equal to several.

    发扬南泥湾艰苦奋斗的光荣传统
    新疆建设兵团莫索湾垦区生产部队建立新的粮棉基地
    中国人民解放军新疆建设兵团莫索湾垦区生产部队，发扬南泥湾的光荣传统，艰苦奋斗，在准噶尔盆地建立了一个新的粮棉基地。
    莫索湾位于准噶尔盆地腹部，是一片满布荆棘的肥沃荒原。多少年来，准噶尔盆地各族人民由于无力制服干旱，一直未能实现开发愿望。1958年，新疆生产建设兵团玛纳斯垦区各军垦农场组织了一支坚强的生产部队，由许多参加过开发南泥湾、金盆湾的老战士率领进入盆地腹部，展开征服莫索湾的壮举。
    一个严寒的深冬，人民解放军新疆生产建设兵团的七个指战员，带了五汽油桶水、一顶帐篷、一口锅、一把菜刀和一些面粉，乘汽车从石河子垦区出发向准噶尔盆地腹部开去。他们到莫索湾的时候，眼前是一望无边、披着雪装的原始索索林。他们在索索林中撑起帐篷，燃起篝火，开始筹建第一个军垦农场——莫索湾二场。率领这支尖兵的是在抗日战争和解放战争中负伤七次、参加过陕北金盆湾大生产运动的场长兼政委萧凤瑞。萧凤瑞和战士们早晨起来带上干粮在荆棘丛中勘察场址。晚上回来时每人背一捆索索柴取暖煮饭。他们规划完毕后，调进一千多名轻装军垦战士，正式开发莫索湾的战斗开始了。 这是1958年初的事情，到今天只两年零十个月。最近我们来这里时，一点荒凉的影子也看不到了。平坦的原野到处渠道纵横，水光闪闪，一块连一块的大片条田伸展到远方的天际，播种冬麦的拖拉机在田间轰鸣，正在收割的玉米棒子足有半尺长，棉田里挂满了雪白棉朵。新栽的林带，已是林荫夹道，林带里躺着密密麻麻的大南瓜，两排向日葵迎风点头。透过林带缝隙望去，有西瓜、哈密瓜累累的瓜田，有枝头垂满蕃茄、辣椒的菜园。载着粮食和菜蔬的卡车不断从这里驶出去。两年半内，莫索湾二场给国家上缴商品粮已达三千多万斤，生产棉花八百八十九万斤。
    莫索湾是准噶尔盆地腹部一片肥沃平坦的荒原，但这里每年除冬季降点雪以外，终年无雨。多少年来，盆地边缘各族农民想开发它，由于没有制服干旱都失败了。人民解放军的军垦战士来莫索湾时，找不到一滴水。起初他们到四十多公里以外的玛纳斯河拉冰化水，一辆汽车一天只拉一趟，一车冰的成本高达四十多元，不但不能全部解决吃水问题，而且提高了农场建设成本。战士们又来打井找水。但干燥的荒地上打到十多米还看不到湿土，有时井底渗出点水，都是咽不下去的苦水。就在这时，莫索湾降了一场雪，战士们连夜制作刮板，把地上的积雪统统收起来。此后，下一次雪，他们就收一次。每个伙食单位都在露天堆了许多雪堆，就连化在地上像纸一样的薄冰，也收得干干净净。为了让雪能长久储存下去，他们在朝着太阳的东南方向用索索柴扎成墙，盖上麦草，遮住太阳光的照射。炊事员做饭时，用桶把雪盛进锅里再化水。在那些日子，从场长到战士每人一天用一茶缸水洗脸、刷牙，早晨洗过脸的水，还要收集起来夜里洗脚，洗衣服。他们就这样，在这个与世隔绝的地区用雪化水维持生活四个月，坚持兴修水利和开荒。
    军垦战士在荒原上修筑渠道和开荒造田的时候，正是零下四十度的寒冬。白天风雪交加，夜里寒风凛冽。因莫索湾没有一点饲草，战士们进来时没有带一匹马，现在渠道工地上一切运输都要人背肩挑。在冰雪初融时节，泥雪封路，运输断绝，蔬菜等副食品供应中断。在这艰苦和困难的时刻，干部像过去在战场上一样，同战士共甘苦，而且带头克服困难。老战士为了大家夜里不受冻，把自己棉被拿来作帐篷上的门帘；许多班长通宵守夜，给战士在帐篷里烧火取暖；场长萧凤瑞虽然因腿负伤走路很不方便，但每天同战士一起挖渠挑土。夜间他得到寒流警报时，步行到各连队告诉战士要在明天出工时多穿衣服。老战士这种可贵的作风，给广大战士增添了克服困难的勇气。战士们脸冻破了，手冻肿了，但没有人叫苦，没有菜吃，他们拿上馒头就盐吃，馒头送到工地时冻硬了，他们塞在怀里暖一暖再吃。战士们说：天再冷，冷不了人民战士的心，风再寒，挡不住我们的施工。他们在冰天雪地奋战了三个多月，修起长达一百七十三公里的引水大渠和灌溉渠道。渠道修通了，但没有水泥和木料作跌水和水闸，战士们就用索索柴和红柳根代替。渠道上的建筑物作好了，但荒原上风化了的干土非常松散，而且到处有地穴和鼠洞。水一流进渠道，干渠四处决口。浇水的战士走在平整过的田间，有时突然连人带工具掉进地穴里。战士们为了夺取春播时机，日日夜夜守在渠畔和田间。在早晚还结冰的初春，那里一冲垮，战士们就跳进黄滚滚的冰水里战斗，垮一处，堵一处。有的战士一见水渠穿洞，立即脱下棉袄、大衣塞进去，然后再用土填。为了防止浇水时掉进地穴里，战士们想出了绑木板的办法，浇水时每人腰里横背一块木板，掉下去也可自己出来。战士们就这样战胜了一个接一个的困难，终于把玛纳斯河水引进田间，当年播种粮食、蔬菜、油料、棉花等春播作物一万三千多亩。这些作物播上之后，他们有了菜吃，牲畜有了饲料，秋后粮食不但达到自给，而且还有剩余上缴。更重要的是他们作为一支前哨部队在莫索湾站稳了脚跟之后，为大规模开发莫索湾创造了条件，当年下半年这里一下就建起了六个军垦农场。
    莫索湾二场的战士建场之后，每年千方百计地把劳力用来扩大耕地面积，增产粮棉。第一年他们荣获国务院当年开荒、当年生产，当年有利的奖状。去年他们把播种面积一跃而扩大了近十倍达到十二万亩。粮食生产除去口粮、籽种、饲料外，上缴国家商品粮达一千二百万斤。今年，战士们在人力和机具没有增加的条件下，又扩大播种面积47％。每个管理小麦的战士平均管到一百多亩，管理棉花的达到五十多亩。战士们不仅管得了，而且管得样样丰产。今年春耕时节，八万多亩春播作物要抢墒播种，七万亩冬麦又要同时耙耱保墒，按实有机具和劳力计算，根本无法兼顾。结果，干部战士一同上地用人拉耙、拉耱，配合少数机具，三天三夜就把七万亩冬麦耙耱完毕。由于及时保墒，今年避免了灾害，获得了大面积高额丰产。夏收期间，秋田和四万多亩棉花管理又同麦收交错在一起，机具实有力量最多只能收割一半。战士们掀起一个轰轰烈烈的高工效运动，他们在苦干和巧干中创造了惊人的高纪录。许多战士用镰刀日割小麦二十多亩。在每项农活中既能苦干，又能巧干的女战士江桂芳，帮助许多同志提高技术，把捆麦工效从几百捆提高到三千捆。她自己钻研出抽腰捆麦法之后，日捆纪录从五、六千捆达到一万四千捆。就是这些成百上千的英雄战士，把七万亩丰产冬麦从每年都有的大风灾害中抢收回来，按时颗粒还家。今年每亩小麦平均单产三百二十斤，一季小麦收成自给全年后，还可上缴国家一千八百万斤。现在这里正是秋收秋种的大忙时刻，按他们实有机具和人力，目前需要增加五万名劳力才能按时完成任务。但他们没有向上级叫困难、要人力，他们解决的办法是挖掘机具潜力，开展机具、人力一顶几的高工效运动。
