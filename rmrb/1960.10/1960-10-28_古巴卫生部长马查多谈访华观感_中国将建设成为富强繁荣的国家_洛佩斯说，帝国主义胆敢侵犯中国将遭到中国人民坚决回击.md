Cuban Minister of Public Health Machado and Professor Lopez, before leaving our country, spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters about their impressions of their visit to China, refuting the imperialists' slanders against the new China. Minister Machado said: "We have personally seen the tremendous achievements made by the Chinese people in construction. All of this proves that some newspapers under the control of U.S. imperialism are nothing more than factories for manufacturing rumors and deception. We have seen that the Chinese people are brave, they have a strong will, and they will build China into a strong and prosperous country."

Minister Machado also said that the Cuban health delegation he led had seen the tremendous achievements made by China in medicine, health, and the Four Pests campaign. He said: "Everything we have seen shows that China has a high level of public health."

Professor Lopez said: "The Chinese people are peace-loving. Whether in Chinese factories or people's communes, we have seen them working enthusiastically, using various methods to improve tools and increase labor productivity. Facts prove that this can only be done in an atmosphere of complete freedom and peace." He also pointed out that the Chinese people also understand that, because imperialism still exists, there is still a danger of war in the world today. He expressed his firm belief that, just like the peace-loving Cuban people, if imperialism dares to invade the Chinese people, the Chinese people will resolutely fight back.

In emphasizing the growing friendly relations between the people of Cuba and China, Minister Machado said: "Our two countries have a common enemy—U.S. imperialism. In the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, the relations between our two peoples are becoming closer every moment."

Professor Lopez said: "The struggle of our two peoples to strive for world peace and end the exploitation of man by man has made our relationship even closer."

    古巴卫生部长马查多谈访华观感
    中国将建设成为富强繁荣的国家
    洛佩斯说，帝国主义胆敢侵犯中国将遭到中国人民坚决回击
    古巴共和国卫生部部长马查多和洛佩斯教授在离开我国前夕向新华社记者谈访华观感，驳斥了帝国主义者对新中国的造谣污蔑。马查多部长说：“我们在中国亲眼看到了中国人民在建设中所取得的巨大成就。这一切都证明在美帝国主义者控制下的一些报刊只不过是谣言和欺骗的制造厂。我们看到中国人民是勇敢的，他们有着坚强的意志，他们将把中国建设成为一个富强繁荣的国家。”
    马查多部长还说，他率领的古巴卫生代表团看到了中国医药卫生方面和除四害运动所取得的巨大成就。他说：“我们看到的一切表明中国的公共卫生水平很高。”
    洛佩斯教授说：“中国人民是爱好和平的。我们不论在中国的工厂和人民公社，都看到他们在热情洋溢地工作，用各种办法来改良工具以提高劳动生产率。事实证明，只有在完全自由与和平的气氛中才能做到这一点。”他还指出，中国人民也了解到，由于帝国主义还存在，今天世界上还存在战争的危险。他表示深信，正如同爱好和平的古巴人民一样，如果帝国主义胆敢侵犯中国人民，中国人民是会坚决回击的。
    在强调古巴和中国两国人民之间日益增长的友好关系时，马查多部长说：“我们两国有共同的敌人——美帝国主义。在反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的斗争中，我们两国人民之间的关系每时每刻都更加亲密起来。”
    洛佩斯教授说：“我们两国人民为争取世界和平、结束人剥削人的现象所作的斗争使得我们之间的关系更加亲密。”
