U.S. Military Chiefs and Arms Monopoly Organizations

American sociologist Wright Mills, in his book "The Causes of World War II," described the role of current U.S. military leaders and their impact on American economy, politics, and social life as follows: "...Senior military personnel currently occupy important positions in our ruling organs... Now, generals of the army and navy can be seen everywhere; they create and maintain a militaristic atmosphere... Military personnel have entered the political and diplomatic circles; they have infiltrated the upper echelons of various companies; they lead scientific and technological research; they influence universities; they control very large advertising and propaganda organizations." Mills also said, "Currently, large companies are making fortunes through war preparations... Upper-level figures in business and industry and senior military officers are jointly concerned with armaments and the continuous vigorous expansion of armaments."

Annual military expenditures exceeding 40 billion U.S. dollars are a reliable source of wealth for U.S. arms monopoly organizations. Arms production is a cash cow for American financial oligarchs. According to materials from the U.S. Department of Defense cited by "The Wall Street Journal," in the 1959 fiscal year, one hundred large American companies obtained 73.8% of the Department of Defense's major military orders. Among them, the eight largest companies (General Dynamics Corporation, Boeing Aircraft Company, North American Aviation, General Electric Company, Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, Douglas Aircraft Company, United Aircraft Corporation, and Martin Aircraft Company) received over 7.3 billion U.S. dollars in military orders in the 1959 fiscal year.

In order to ensure huge profits from arms production and compete for more military orders, American monopoly groups are increasingly tightening their control over government military departments. Various monopoly groups vigorously buy off senior military generals. Many generals, after retiring, are immediately given high-level positions in large companies by monopoly capitalists, using their past relationships with military departments to sign favorable order contracts for their companies.

General Dynamics Corporation, which has relationships with the Rockefeller, Lehman, and Morgan families, is currently the largest company in the United States producing missiles, military aircraft, and submarines. It has extremely close ties with the U.S. Department of Defense. The board of directors of General Dynamics Corporation has recruited a large number of retired senior military officers, including twenty-seven senior generals of the army and navy, and six former Undersecretaries of Defense or Secretaries of the Army. The general manager of General Dynamics Corporation, Frank Pace Jr., once served as Secretary of the Army and is a strong advocate for expanding armaments and preparing for war. Before 1957, General Dynamics Corporation ranked seventh among the ten companies in the United States receiving the most military orders. In 1957, it jumped to first place. In 1959, the net profit of General Dynamics Corporation reached 31.1 million U.S. dollars.

Boeing Aircraft Company is the main supplier of strategic bombers for the U.S. Air Force. Retired senior generals who hold positions in this company include Oldfield, Weeks, Crosthwaite, and Gaerig, among others.

General Electric Company is a component of the Morgan empire. The Morgan consortium has more than ten representatives on the board of directors of General Electric Company. Former Secretary of State Stettinius and former Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization, Charles Wilson, who presided over the allocation of military order contracts, have served as directors on the company's board. Currently, retired senior generals holding important positions in General Electric Company include Adair, Hansell, Langquist, Roper, Kinsella, and Watson, among others.

Lockheed Aircraft Corporation and Douglas Aircraft Company are two aircraft manufacturing companies controlled by the California consortium. The chairman of the board of directors of this company is oil tycoon Hoover Jr., and director William Burden served as a special assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force from 1950 to 1952. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation has twenty-four retired senior generals, including Lieutenant General Smith, Major General of the Army, and Rear Admirals such as Durlflinger and Emore, among others. Senior generals working in Douglas Aircraft Company include Lieutenant General Eck, Major General Eichmeyer, and De Flore, among others.

Martin Aircraft Company, controlled by the Rockefeller consortium, now specializes in manufacturing missiles. In order to win missile orders, Martin Aircraft Company often holds banquets for senior officers of the Department of Defense at the "Eleutheria Club" in the suburbs of the Bahamas and Florida. In the past three years, more than twenty senior generals have taken "pleasant trips" to the Bahamas at Martin Aircraft Company's expense, including Twining, the recently retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Currently, Sullivan, who served as Secretary of the Navy from 1947 to 1949, and many retired senior generals serve on the board of directors of Martin Aircraft Company.

In addition to the above eight large companies, dozens of other large American companies manufacturing aircraft and missiles are sparing no effort in buying off military personnel to win military orders. Many military leaders, because they have worked hard for monopoly capitalists during their tenure, receive rewards from capitalists after their retirement.

After retiring from the army, General Campbell was invited by Curtiss-Wright Aircraft Company to be a manager and also served as Vice President of International Harvester Company. This was because Campbell had signed a contract with International Harvester Company when he was the Chief of the Ordnance Technical Supply Department, bringing the company a profit of 750,000 U.S. dollars. Air Force Major General Edward Powel is now the Director of the Aviation Division of Curtiss-Wright Aircraft Company.

The notorious General MacArthur is now the Chairman of Sperry Rand Rocket Production Company. In 1958, this company obtained more than 370 million U.S. dollars in military orders. General McLarney and Admiral Richardson are vice presidents of Convair, a division of General Dynamics Company, which obtained more than 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in military orders in 1958. The general manager of Vought Aircraft Company is Admiral Salada, and the vice president of Hughes Aircraft Company is General Iker. Admiral Radford is now the manager of Figh Company, which produces electrical equipment and military orders worth 70 million U.S. dollars. General Bradley is the chairman of the Buffalo Research and Development Laboratory. Generals Haywood and Admiral Hatcher, who helped the company sign military order contracts with the Department of Defense worth 442 million U.S. dollars, hold important positions in the jet aircraft company that produces missiles and rockets.

Examples of the close collusion between U.S. military leaders and arms monopoly organizations are countless. U.S. Senator Douglas once pointed out that 92% of the military order contracts signed in 1957 were signed based on personal relationships. From the above materials, it can be seen that U.S. military leaders are completely obedient tools of monopoly capitalists. (Leshan)

    美国军事头目和军火垄断组织
    美国社会学家赖特·米尔斯在他所著的“第二次世界大战的起因”这本书中，对目前美国军事头目的作用和他们对美国经济、政治、社会生活的影响，作了这样的叙述：“……高级军人目前在我国统治机关中占据着重要的地位……现在到处都可以看到陆海军将领的踪影；他们创造和维持军国主义气氛……军人打入了政界和外交圈子；他们渗入各公司的上层；他们领导科学技术研究；他们影响高等学校；他们控制着非常庞大的广告、宣传机构。”米尔斯又说，“目前，大公司靠备战发财……工商界上层人物和高级军官共同关心着军备和不断大力扩充军备。”
    每年数达四百亿美元以上的军事开支，对美国军火垄断组织说来，是一个可靠的财源。军火生产是美国金融寡头的摇钱树。根据“华尔街日报”引用的美国国防部材料，在1959财政年度，一百家美国大公司获得了国防部主要军事订货的73.8％。而其中最大的八家公司（通用动力公司、波音飞机公司、北美航空公司、通用电气公司、洛克希德飞机公司、道格拉斯飞机公司、联合飞机公司和马丁飞机公司）在1959财政年度获取的军事订货高达七十三亿美元以上。
    美国垄断集团为了确保从军火生产中获得巨额利润，争夺更多的军事订货，日益加紧了对政府军事部门的控制。各个垄断集团大力收买高级军事将领，许多将领退役后立即被垄断资本家给予大公司的高级职位，利用他们过去同军事部门的关系，为自己的公司签订有利的订货合同。
    同洛克菲勒、利曼、摩根家族都有关系的通用动力公司，是美国目前的生产导弹、军用飞机、潜水艇的最大的公司。它与美国国防部有极其密切的联系。通用动力公司董事会搜罗了一大批退役的高级军官，其中有二十七名为陆海军高级将领，六名前国防部副部长或陆军部长。通用动力公司的总经理小佛朗克·佩司曾经担任过陆军部长的职务，是一个极力鼓吹扩军备战的人。通用动力公司在1957年以前，在美国接受军事订货最多的十家公司中，名列第七，1957年，跃居首位。1959年，通用动力公司的纯利润达三千一百一十万美元。
    波音飞机公司是美国空军战略轰炸机的主要供应者。在这家公司担任职务的退役高级将领有奥尔德菲尔德、威克斯、克罗斯韦特、加耳平等多人。
    通用电气公司是摩根帝国的组成部分。在通用电气公司董事会中，摩根财团的代表达十余人之多。在这个公司董事会中担任过董事职务的有前国务卿斯退丁纽斯，前民防国防动员署署长，曾主持过分配军事订货合同的查尔斯·威尔逊。现在在通用电气公司担任要职的退役高级将领有阿德尔、汉塞耳、朗奎斯特、罗珀、金塞拉、沃森等多人。
    洛克希德飞机公司和道格拉斯飞机公司是加利福尼亚财团控制下的两个飞机制造公司。这家公司董事会的主席是石油巨头小胡佛，董事威廉·伯登曾于1950—1952年担任空军部长特别助理。洛克希德飞机公司拥有二十四名退役高级将领，其中包括史密斯中将、陆军少将和海军少将如杜尔弗林格、埃摩尔等人。在道格拉斯飞机公司中任职的高级将领有陆军中将埃克、陆军少将艾克迈尔、德·弗洛尔等多人。
    由洛克菲勒财团操纵的马丁飞机公司，现在专门制造导弹。为了争取导弹订货，马丁飞机公司经常在巴哈马群岛和佛罗里达河畔的城郊“艾勒弗特里亚俱乐部”举行宴会，招待国防部的高级军官。三年以来，用马丁飞机公司的钱在巴哈马群岛作“愉快的旅行”的高级将领达二十余人，其中包括最近退职的参谋长联席会议主席特文宁。目前在马丁飞机公司董事会中任职的有1947—1949年担任海军部长的沙利文以及退役高级将领多名。
    除了上述八家大公司以外，美国其他数十家制造飞机和导弹的大公司在收买军人争取军事订货方面也不遗余力。许多军事头目由于在任期间竭力为垄断资本效劳，他们在退役后都获得资本家的奖赏。
    陆军将领坎贝尔退役以后，便被寇蒂斯·赖特飞机公司请去当经理，并兼国际收割机公司副总经理。因为坎贝尔在担任炮兵物资技术供应处处长时，曾同国际收割机公司签订过合同，给该公司带来七十五万美元的利润。空军少将爱德华·鲍威尔现在是寇蒂斯·赖特飞机公司航空处处长。
    臭名远扬的麦克阿瑟将军现在是斯伯里—伦德火箭生产公司董事长。1958年，这家公司取得了三亿七千多万美元的军事订货。麦克勒尼将军和理查逊海军上将是通用动力公司分部——康瓦尔公司的副总经理，这个公司在1958年取得的军事订货达十三亿美元以上。沃格特飞机公司的总经理是海军上将萨拉达，休斯飞机公司的副总经理是伊克尔将军。雷德福海军上将现在是生产电气设备、军事订货达七千万美元的飞歌公司的经理。布莱德雷将军任布法罗研究和开发实验室的董事长。在生产导弹、火箭的喷气飞机公司中担任要职的有海伏德将军和哈奇尔海军上将，他们曾经帮助这个公司同国防部签订数达四亿四千二百万美元的军事订货合同。
    美国军事头目同军火垄断组织紧密勾结的例证是不胜枚举的。美国参议员道格拉斯曾经指出，1957年所签订的军事订货合同，有92％是根据私人关系签订的。从以上材料可以看出，美国军事头目完全是垄断资本家的顺从工具。　（乐山）
