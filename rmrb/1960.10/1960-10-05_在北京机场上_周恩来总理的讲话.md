　　Today, our respected Premier U Nu and his wife, as well as part of the distinguished guests from the Burmese government delegation, are about to leave Beijing via Kunming to return home.

At this moment of parting, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, to once again express our heartfelt thanks for your friendly visit!

　　Respected Burmese friends, you came to China with profound friendship, and now you are returning to Burma with the victorious results of this visit. Thanks to your extraordinary visit and the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, Sino-Burmese friendly relations have reached a new peak. The Chinese people will cherish this ever-developing friendship and will make new contributions to further consolidate and develop this friendship.

　　Prime Minister, distinguished Burmese guests, in these short few days, you have already seen how deep the feelings of the Chinese people are towards the Burmese people. I look forward to bringing this friendship to Burma in January next year, in response to your great and friendly visit.

　　I wish Prime Minister U Nu and his wife, as well as the distinguished Burmese guests, good health and a safe journey!
