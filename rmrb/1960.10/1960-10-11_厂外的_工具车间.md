    The "Tool Workshop" Outside the Factory
    A burst of urgent knocking on the door awakened Wang Yaoming, a salesperson at the Shanghai Hardware Tool Rental Store. It was already two o'clock in the morning, so why was someone still coming to borrow something? He put on his clothes and opened the door.
    A middle-aged man rushed in and asked, "Comrade, do you have a 'pipe wrench'?" It turned out that he was a worker from the nearby Assorted File Factory. To realize iron-making gasification, the entire factory's workers were working hard to dig a biogas well. In the middle of the digging, they suddenly discovered that the screw thread at a joint of a steel pipe was rusted and needed to be re-threaded with a "pipe wrench" to continue digging. However, they didn't have this kind of tool themselves, so they came to the rental store. Unfortunately, all the "pipe wrenches" in the store had been rented out.
    Wang Yaoming was as anxious as the worker, thinking: We absolutely cannot let the project be stalled due to the lack of this tool. He hesitated for a moment, then opened the rental register and started calling the units that had borrowed "pipe wrenches" one by one. Finally, he found the Minsheng Bean Products Processing Plant. When they heard that the File Factory was in urgent need, they prioritized others before themselves and readily agreed.
    Similar things like this often happen in the rental store.
    This store is specifically set up for renting various tools. The store is equipped with various tools for drilling, cutting, grinding, splitting, and breaking, commonly used in factories' daily production, ranging from "jacks" that can lift twenty-five-ton heavy machinery to tiny drill bits as thin as matchsticks; from reamers with a precision of several threads to simple bricklaying trowels and wall-painting brushes, everything is available. Factories that need to rent tools can use them for an hour by paying only a few cents, a few fen, or even a few li. If necessary, they can also rent them for a day or several days. For example, renting a hacksaw frame costs only one li per hour, and only one fen for ten hours.
    Now, more than 500 factories and enterprises come to the rental store to borrow tools every day, which not only strongly supports production but also fully utilizes the potential of tool usage. In the process of realizing the electrification of cutting and sewing at the Shuguang Children's Clothing Factory, most of the tools needed were borrowed from the rental store. If they had bought the tools themselves, it would have cost five or six hundred yuan, but now they only spent more than fifty yuan in rental fees and accomplished a major task. Therefore, the workers affectionately call it the "tool workshop" outside the factory.

### 厂外的“工具车间”

    厂外的“工具车间”
    一阵急促的敲门声，惊醒了上海五金工具出租商店的营业员王耀明。此刻已经是午夜两点钟了，怎么还有人来借东西呢？他披上衣服开了门。
    一个中年人冲了进来，开口就问：“同志，有没有‘管子绞扳？’”原来他是附近什锦锉刀厂的工人，为了实现打铁沼气化，全厂工人大打沼气井。打到半途中，突然发现一根钢管接头处的螺丝纹锈坏了，要用“管子绞扳”重新绞过，才能继续打下去。但是，自己没有这种工具，这才来到出租商店。真不凑巧，店里所有的“管子绞扳”都借出去了。
    王耀明同工人一样焦急，心想：无论如何不能因为缺少这个工具使工程停顿。他踌躇了片刻，就翻开出租登记簿，按着借用“管子绞扳”的单位，一家家打起电话来。最后，找到民盛豆制品加工场，对方听说锉刀厂急需，就来个先人后己，一口答应了。
    类似这样的事情，在出租商店里经常都会碰到。
    这商店是专门为出租各种工具而设的。店里备有各种工厂日常生产上用的钻、切、磨、割、断的工具，从可以抬起二十五吨重型机器的“千斤顶”，到细得像火柴梗一样的打眼钻头；从精密度达到几丝的绞刀，到简单的砌砖泥刀、刷墙排笔等，应有尽有。需要租借工具的工厂，只要花几角、几分、甚至几厘钱，就能拿去使用一个小时。有必要的话，也可以租上一天或几天。比如租用軷锯架，一个小时只要一厘，十个小时也不过一分钱。
    现在每天到出租商店来借用工具的工厂、企业有五百多家，不但有力地支持了生产，而且充分发挥了工具使用的潜力。曙光童装厂实现裁剪、缝纫电动化的过程中，需要的工具大都是向出租商店借用的。如果自己买工具，就要花五、六百元，而现在只花了五十多元租费，就办成了大事。因此，工人们都亲热地称它为厂外的“工具车间”。
