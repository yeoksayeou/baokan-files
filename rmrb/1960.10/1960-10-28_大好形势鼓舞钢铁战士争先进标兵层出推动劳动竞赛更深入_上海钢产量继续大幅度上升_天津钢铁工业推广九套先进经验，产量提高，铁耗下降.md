Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 27th: Since entering the fourth quarter, the increase production and practice economy movement on Shanghai's steel front has been developing more extensively and deeply. Good news of all-round leaps forward in open hearth, electric furnace, and converter production has been pouring in. Following a rise in September, the city's steel production rose significantly again in October. In particular, the average daily output in the last five days of the middle ten days of October increased by 13% compared with the first five days. The qualified rate of converter steel has been raised to about 98%, and the consumption of pig iron per ton of steel has continued to decline.

    Upon entering October, workers in Shanghai's steel plants closely combined discussions of the fourth quarter production plan, spoke freely about the excellent domestic situation, and closely linked the production of their factories, workshops, work sections, and even a single furnace with this excellent situation. Through discussions and forums, workers further recognized the significance of producing one more ton of steel to change the country's "poor and blank" state and to support the technical transformation of agriculture. Therefore, everyone was determined to strive for advancement, and seizing a substantial increase in steel production became the workers' conscious action. Workers at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 calculated that if they could produce 1,000 more tons of steel, the country could increase production by several hundred tractors or more than twenty 10,000-kilowatt generators. Therefore, the workers tried every possible means to tap production potential, reduce iron consumption, and increase steel production. In the first and middle ten days of October, the average daily steel output of this plant increased by 7.06% compared with the same period in September.

    The large-scale planting of red flags, the establishment of model workers, and mass labor emulation on the city's steel front have further developed in October. Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3's No. 1 cupola, the city's model furnace, has reached a new level, with a melting rate of 20.7 tons in one cycle. The momentum of various factories catching up with this advanced model in October was even greater. The experience of this cupola of "politics to the furnace front" has fully blossomed and borne fruit: the average melting rate of large cupolas in various steel plants in the city has reached more than 15 tons, and the melting rate of many cupolas has approached or caught up with that of No. 1 furnace. Some furnaces have even exceeded the level of No. 1 furnace in one or several production cycles. The experience of No. 1 furnace is also being comprehensively promoted in electric furnaces, open hearth furnaces, and various furnaces, various types of work, and auxiliary departments, further promoting the deep development of labor emulation between them, forming a new upsurge in the competition for everyone to strive for the upstream, strive for advancement, and increase steel production, and more red flag furnaces, red flag work sections, red flag groups, and advanced model workers have emerged. In the middle ten days of October, after a city-wide large-scale evaluation, 117 advanced collectives were established. The competition among the city's five major converter workshops was particularly heated. In the first five days of October, the Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 produced more than 1,000 tons of steel less than another large converter workshop. In the second five days, the Second Converter Workshop of Plant No. 3 caught up quickly, narrowing the gap in the ten-day steel output between the two sides to only more than 60 tons. At this critical moment, the workers of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 changed the past method of inspection and evaluation after shifts to inspection and evaluation during four-hour shifts, so that problems found in the first four hours of production could be solved in a timely manner in the next four hours. In this way, with one effort, the output exceeded the other party by more than 1,000 tons in the third five days, ranking first in the city and continuing to lead among the five major converter workshops. At the same time, the small electric furnaces and small converters in the city's steel "small indigenous groups," after the first evaluation of the city's model furnaces at the beginning of the month, the competition to catch up with the advanced was also extremely fierce, and steel production generally increased, playing a considerable role in ensuring a substantial increase in the city's steel production.

    In order to adapt to the current excellent situation of continued growth in steel production, various factories have also organized close cooperation networks with the furnace front as the center, with various departments such as transportation, supply and marketing, testing, and maintenance, closely linked to create conditions for increasing production at the furnace front.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 27th: Tianjin's steel industry has summarized and matched nine sets of advanced experience and promoted them in various steel plants in the city, making the increase production and practice economy movement develop more deeply. From October 1st to 25th, the daily production level of steel increased compared with the same period in September. The average daily production level in the last five days of the middle ten days of October increased by 21.9% compared with the first five days, and the average daily production level in the first five days of the last ten days increased by 20.5% compared with the last five days of the middle ten days. The qualified rate of steel reached 98.34%, and the consumption of pig iron was further reduced, creating a favorable situation for working hard in the fourth quarter and striving for a complete victory this year.

    Recently, the workers and staff members of Tianjin's steel industry have universally carried out activities to summarize and promote advanced technical experience. The city quickly matched the experience of nine types of work, including cupolas, steelmaking furnaces, dolomite calcination, furnace building, casting, overhead cranes, in-plant transportation, electric furnaces, and machine repair and maintenance. After these nine sets of advanced experience appeared, "three-in-one" technical experience promotion teams and inspection teams composed of leading cadres, advanced model workers, and technical personnel went to various factories, workshops, and groups to make technical performances and promote them universally. The workers and staff members actively learned from each other and helped each other, striving to quickly master them. At the beginning of October, the workers of converters, cupolas, and dolomite calcination furnaces in various steel plants and refractory material factories signed learning and competition contracts in the promotion of advanced experience of the same type of work. The contract signed by the cupola workers of the city's four steel plants clearly stipulates the comprehensive promotion of advanced operating experience based on the experience of the cupola of the Fourth Steel Plant. The workers of various factories took the initiative to go to the Fourth Steel Plant to "learn from experience," and the Fourth Steel Plant also sent the best cupola foremen and veteran workers and technicians to various factories to "deliver treasures." After the secretary of the Party Committee of Tianjin Second Steel Plant led the cupola workers to study at the Fourth Steel Plant, he immediately established a Cupola Reform Committee, planted large "experimental fields," and earnestly promoted it. The Fourth Steel Plant also sent a foreman, a veteran worker, and a technician to be stationed in the Second Steel Plant to provide specific assistance. The three cupolas that have now been transformed by the Second Steel Plant have significantly improved their furnace age, desulfurization rate, and melting rate. In the promotion of complete sets of converter experience, the blowing time of Yang Ziqi's team of the Second Steel Plant was relatively long, and they were not sure about using "single-slag operation." Yang Desheng, the leader of the city's model worker Yang Desheng's team, personally went to Yang Ziqi's team to perform and help them master advanced experience. After the workers of Han Jiapeng's converter team of Tianjin Third Steel Plant went to the Second Steel Plant to study the experience of Yang Desheng's team, which created "zero waste products in a thousand furnaces," they carried out a competition for zero waste products in more than a thousand furnaces. Now they have achieved more than 500 consecutive furnaces without waste products, and the production plan has been completed very well, becoming the plant's advanced model.

    In addition to promoting complete sets of advanced technical experience, the workers and staff members of various factories have continuously carried out technical innovations around new production key points, and promptly summarized the newly emerging advanced experience and quickly disseminated it. The workers of the cupola work section of Tianjin Fourth Steel Plant improved operation and equipment with a spirit of continuous revolution, breaking through production key points, so that the furnace age jumped from more than 70 furnaces in the past to more than 430 furnaces, and the average desulfurization rate increased from 50% to about 80%. The melting rate has also increased by one-third, becoming a high-yield, high-quality, and long-life red flag for cupolas in the city.

    大好形势鼓舞钢铁战士争先进标兵层出推动劳动竞赛更深入
    上海钢产量继续大幅度上升
    天津钢铁工业推广九套先进经验，产量提高，铁耗下降
    据新华社上海27日电　上海钢铁战线进入第四季度以来，增产节约运动开展得更加广泛、深入。平炉、电炉、转炉生产全面跃进的捷报，纷至沓来。全市钢产量继9月份上升之后，10月份又有大幅度上升，特别是中旬后五天的平均日产量，比前五天增长13％。转炉钢的合格率已经提高到98％左右，每吨钢的生铁消耗也继续下降。
    一进入10月份，上海各钢铁厂职工紧紧结合讨论第四季度生产计划，畅谈了国内的大好形势，并把自己工厂、车间、工段甚至一座炉子的生产和这个大好形势紧密联系起来。通过座谈、讨论，工人们进一步认识到自己多炼一吨钢对改变国家“一穷二白”面貌的意义，对支援农业技术改造的作用。因此，人人发愤图强，夺取钢产量大幅度增长便成为工人群众自觉的行动。上钢一厂的工人算了一笔账：如果在自己的手里多生产一千吨钢，就可以使国家增产几百台拖拉机或者二十多台一万瓩的发电机。于是，工人们千方百计挖掘生产潜力，降低铁耗，增产钢铁。10月上、中旬，这个厂钢的平均日产量比9月同期增长了7.06％。
    全市钢铁战线大插红旗、大树标兵和群众性的劳动竞赛，10月份又有进一步的发展。全市标兵炉——上钢三厂一号化铁炉更上一层楼，有一个周期的熔化率达到二十点七吨。各厂10月份追赶这个先进标兵的声势更大。这个化铁炉的“政治上炉前”的经验，已经全面开花结果：全市各钢厂大型化铁炉的熔化率平均达到了十五吨以上，很多化铁炉的熔化率已经接近或赶上了一号炉，有的炉子在一个或几个生产周期中甚至超过了一号炉的水平。一号炉的经验，还在电炉、平炉以及焙烧炉等各种炉子、各个工种和辅助部门全面推广，进一步推动了它们之间的劳动竞赛深入开展，形成了人人争上游、争先进、增产钢的竞赛新高潮，涌现了更多的红旗炉、红旗工段、红旗小组和先进标兵。10月中旬，经过全市性的大评比，树立了一百一十七个先进集体。全市五大转炉车间的竞赛尤为热烈。在10月份头五天内，上钢三厂第二转炉车间比另一个大型转炉车间少炼了一千多吨钢；在第二个五天中，三厂第二转炉车间急起直追，把双方十天钢产量的差距缩小到只有六十多吨。在这紧要关头，上钢三厂工人又把过去班后检查评比的办法，改为四小时班中检查评比，使前四小时生产中发现的问题，及时在后四小时内加以解决。这样，一鼓作气，在第三个五天内，产量反而超过了对方一千多吨，跃居全市第一，继续在五大转炉车间中领先。与此同时，全市炼钢“小洋群”中的小电炉、小转炉，在月初第一次评出了全市标兵炉以后，追赶先进的竞赛也异常猛烈，钢产量普遍提高，对保证全市钢产量大幅度上升，起了相当作用。
    为了适应当前钢铁生产继续增长这一大好形势，各厂还以炉前为中心，运输、供销、化验、检修等各个部门，组织了紧密的协作网，一环紧扣一环，为炉前增产创造条件。
    据新华社天津27日电　天津市钢铁工业总结、配成九套先进经验，在全市各钢厂推广，使增产节约运动更加深入地发展。10月1日到25日，钢的日产水平又比9月同期有了提高，10月中旬的后五天平均日产水平比前五天增加21.9％，下旬前五天的平均日产水平又比中旬的后五天提高20.5％。钢的合格率达到98.34％，生铁消耗进一步降低，为大干第四季度，争取今年全胜，创造了有利形势。
    近来，天津市钢铁工业职工普遍地开展总结、推广先进技术经验的活动。全市迅速配成了化铁炉、炼钢炉、白云石锻烧、砌炉、浇铸、天车、厂内运输、电炉和机修保全等九个工种的经验。这九套先进经验出现以后，又由领导干部、先进标兵和技术人员组成“三结合”技术经验推广队和检查小组等，分赴各工厂、车间、小组巡回作技术表演，普遍推广。工人群众积极地互学互帮，力求迅速掌握。10月初，各个钢厂和耐火器材厂的转炉、化铁炉和白云石锻烧炉的工人们，在推广同工种的先进经验中，分别签订了学、赶竞赛合同。全市四个钢厂的化铁炉工人签订的合同中，明确规定全面推广以第四钢厂化铁炉经验为主的先进操作经验。各厂工人都主动到第四钢厂“取经”，第四钢厂也派出最好的化铁炉炉长和老工人、技术人员到各厂“送宝”。天津第二钢厂党委书记率领化铁炉工人到第四钢厂学习回来后，立即成立化铁炉改革委员会，大种“试验田”，认真推广。第四钢厂也派了一名炉长、一名老工人和一名技术人员，常驻第二钢厂具体帮助。现在第二钢厂已改造完的三座化铁炉，炉龄、脱硫率和熔化率都有显著提高。在转炉推广成套经验中，第二钢厂杨子琦小组炼钢的吹炼时间较长，对使用“单渣操作”没有把握，全市标兵杨德生小组的组长杨德生，就亲自到杨子琦小组表演，帮助他们掌握先进经验。天津第三钢厂转炉韩家朋小组工人，到第二钢厂实地学习了创“千炉无废品”的杨德生小组的经验后，开展了千炉以上无废品的竞赛，现在已经达到连续五百多炉无废品，生产计划也完成得很好，成为全厂的先进标兵。
    除了推广配套的先进技术经验以外，各厂职工都不断围绕新的生产关键，开展技术革新，并且及时总结新出现的先进经验，迅速传播。天津第四钢厂化铁炉工段的工人，以不断革命精神改进操作和设备，连破生产关键，使炉龄由过去七十多炉跃进到四百三十多炉，平均脱硫率由50％提高到80％左右。熔化率也提高了三分之一，成为全市化铁炉的一面高产、优质、长寿的红旗。
