Mathematical Workers Must Vigorously Serve Agriculture
Hua Luogeng, Director of the Institute of Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Agriculture is the foundation, industry is the leading factor, and simultaneous development of industry and agriculture is a fundamental policy put forward by Chairman Mao for developing China's national economy. In order to develop agriculture at a high speed, the Party Central Committee has repeatedly issued the call to "support agriculture" to the whole country. The people of the whole country—including of course mathematical workers across the country—are actively responding to this call, serving agriculture with full enthusiasm and in every possible way, or actively preparing to serve agriculture. This is a major event.

Recently, the whole country is in action, and in many aspects, there have already been great achievements. As we move towards further comprehensive action and more planned action, a "bird's-eye view" of how mathematical methods can play a role in supporting agriculture will be beneficial to our further "practical work."

1. Site Selection. For example, threshing grounds, rice fields, pig farms, manure pits, warehouses, machine wells, and substations used jointly by these machine wells, various construction sites, and public cement mixing areas (or lime pools), etc., all have location problems or relative location problems. Good location selection can reduce travel distance, save materials, and save a lot of labor. In particular, the more frequently used facilities need to be considered for optimal location, because a little bit each day adds up significantly. These problems can all be solved using mathematical methods. For example, for a rectangular vegetable field, it is best to place the manure pit at the midpoint of the long side. If the manure pit is inside the field, then the midpoint is best.

2. Labor Combination. The problem of labor combination has two aspects: First, due to the different types of labor, such as children, adults, women, etc., as well as the different physical conditions and past experiences of each type of labor, different jobs have different efficiencies. To ensure the completion of the task while maximizing labor efficiency, the method of efficiency ratio needs to be used to solve this problem. Although this method still requires effort to popularize in situations with many types and many jobs, in general, in rural areas, where types are only divided into strong, female, and old, and there are not too many types of work, it is not difficult to handle. Second, how to rationally divide and arrange labor is also a problem that must be carefully considered in scheduling. On a threshing ground, who unloads the carts, who threshes, who turns and dries, who winnows, etc., good coordination allows everyone to give full play to their abilities and achieve twice the result with half the effort. Poor coordination will result in a situation described by the saying: "As chaotic as a threshing ground," failing to realize everyone's potential.

3. Crop Layout. Different soils and different irrigation conditions are suitable for planting different crops. There are also objective requirements for the needs of various crops, which do not allow us to arbitrarily follow the principle of planting whatever is easy to grow. Considering the best possible solution within various contradictions is a typical problem of linear programming. Good consideration can increase yields. More complex: If we consider various factors such as multiple cropping, intercropping, and crop rotation, then it will be a mathematical problem with development in itself.

4. Commune Transportation. How to rationally organize and utilize the commune's various means of transportation, and rationally dispatch them to minimize travel distance and maximize the amount of goods transported, is an application and development of transportation problems in linear programming. This is exactly the problem we can start with first, because the method is almost ready-made and easy to popularize. Of course, in the direction of "larger and more public," if even the roads of the commune are re-planned, it will save even more transportation capacity.

5. Water. Calculating water accounts well is an important part of increasing agricultural production. If we use the water in the reservoir without limit in the summer, and there is no water in the autumn drought, will it not cause losses? If we keep the water without a plan, not using it when there is water, on the one hand, cannot maximize the benefits of the reservoir, and on the other hand, once there are continuous autumn rains, the reservoir overflows and loses control, it may cause disasters. Therefore, the inflow and outflow of reservoirs is an important matter. Only by doing a good job of "water use budgeting" can we achieve: water is large enough not to overflow the dam, and water is small enough for irrigation.

6. Strive for Maximum Harvest. If the estimated result is that there is not enough "water" (maybe not enough "fertilizer"), how can we strive for the maximum harvest under such conditions? Of course, if we knew earlier, we could rationally arrange drought-resistant crops to maximize the harvest. If we didn't know in advance, and the drought suddenly appeared, then we should consider the problem of minimum "sacrifice." And this is exactly the problem we can solve using "game theory" (formerly translated as "theory of games"). Some may say that this problem of "game theory" can be solved by ordinary linear programming. Good! No need to argue, this is a topic we can do our best on.

7. Estimate Agricultural Products. If we can know the output earlier and more accurately, it will not only help the people's commune arrange its own economy, but it will also be very helpful for the state to formulate the construction plan for the second year. And estimating output is exactly what our mathematical workers should do. And as long as mathematical workers make a little effort and cooperate with aerial surveying teams, using aerial photography for large-area output estimation is entirely possible.

8. The "eight-character constitution" for agriculture, "soil, fertilizer, water, seed, close planting, protection, management, and tools," each character has its appropriate limit, and the eight characters are a unified whole. Studying the limits of each character requires mathematics, and studying the intricate relationships between the eight characters also requires mathematics. Here, we can use the method of correlation analysis to see when and where, which factor plays the main role, etc. And the application of experimental design and statistical analysis methods in statistics is even more common, so I won't say much about it here.

9. Fishing. Raising fish in reservoirs, the more you catch, the greater the economic benefits. But in terms of reproduction, leaving too few will make it difficult to reproduce. How can we achieve just the right balance? Of course, fishery experts will set a saturation limit for fish farming in a reservoir based on objective conditions, but how to do "household registration" for fish, this is what mathematical workers can do best. And what kind of fish density can achieve the fastest growth potential is also a problem that mathematical workers can participate in solving.

Not only "fish" are like this, but also hunting in forestry is like this. Sable fur is precious, but excessive hunting will lead to a decrease or even extinction of sables. The harvesting of wild medicines (such as ginseng) also has the same problem.

The aspects mentioned above are certainly not complete, and are only limited to some more direct problems. In addition to these, such as the problem of plow surfaces and the problem of weather forecasting, it is clear that mathematical workers need to participate in the work. In short, with a red heart—a red heart for serving socialist agriculture—and a red banner—the banner of Mao Zedong Thought—brought to the countryside, combined with the ever-changing specific circumstances, mathematical workers will not worry about having no place to use their talents. If everyone can see the problem, and everyone can create new methods to solve the problem, then the content of commune mathematics will surely advance rapidly and be infinitely rich.

To do this work well, we must bear in mind the experience of Shandong (referring to Shandong's widespread application of operations research to tap production potential; for details, see the report in this newspaper on July 29, 1960)—handing over the methods to the broad masses. Of course, judging from the current situation, we cannot hand over all the mathematical knowledge mentioned above to the peasant masses, but we have the responsibility to simplify the complex and make the difficult easy, and try our best to hand over the most useful methods to the masses. For example, for the problem of threshing ground settings, based on the Shandong experience, Beijing proposed the formula "Grasp the ends, the smallest advances one station." This formula is both a theorem and an operating method. Its meaning is that if there are several wheat fields connected by roads, compare the output of each end point and count the smallest into the next station. This is done time after time, and the final location is the most transport-saving threshing ground. This method is easily mastered by the masses. Another example is the twenty-character formula for transportation deployment: "Flow direction draws the right side, counter-flow is not appropriate, inner circle and outer circle, neither is half a circle long," which can be taught to transportation workers in five minutes to check whether the transportation deployment plan is the best.

"Mathematics returns home," handing over mathematics to the workers and peasants is a set and unswerving direction. To do this work well, we must "simplify," we must "make it shallow," and we must create tools to make calculations convenient and simple. Therefore, the task of mathematical workers is twofold: they must drill into the heights and pave the low places. Drill into the heights, drill into the essence of things, understand the great principles, and seek their common points in many different forms of work, so that those who come later can "learn one thing and use it in many ways." And on the other hand, we must pave the low places, explain the most useful mathematics in the most plain language, so that everyone will use it. Of course, we do not exclude "knowing what it is, but not knowing why" in "knowing how to use." But as the level of culture gradually improves, "as the tide rises, so does the boat," the "unknowing" will become "knowing." Gradually higher, gradually deeper, gradually wider, and gradually broader, today's cutting edge will become tomorrow's common sense. These things that know what they are but do not know why are precisely good topics that are fascinating and encourage people to move forward.

Perhaps some people think that the various aspects mentioned above are "humble and without high theory," and the task cannot drive the discipline. This view is unsound. First, the above-mentioned are roughly certain and relatively ready-made. When everyone delves into finding problems, there will definitely be new and good topics appearing, and the vitality of new and good topics must be greater than these, and more truths can be seen. And even with the above, if we slightly look back at the situation in the past two or three years, we can already see the situation of "yesterday and today are very different."

Taking linear programming as an example, a few years ago, there were very few people who knew it, but today there are tens of thousands. The previous level of understanding was only a list of graphical operation methods, tabular operation methods, multiplier methods, and simplex methods, or circling around in each method, but today not only have the methods been developed, but also the methods have converged to their origins, knowing that they are connected by one thread and are consistent in principle. In particular, knowing that the graphical operation method is the tabular operation method, although each has its own strengths and weaknesses in application, they are completely equivalent in theory. Furthermore, a system of simultaneous equations deals with the problem of generally as many unknowns as equations, while linear programming deals with the problem of fewer equations than unknowns. As for the "multi-factor analysis" problem mentioned earlier, it involves the situation of contradictory equations with more equations than unknowns (this phenomenon also often occurs in experimental physics). Therefore, there is a possibility of the convergence of the three methods, and at the same time, there is a possibility of mutual borrowing and mutual inspiration, that is, the existing methods for one type of problem can be applied to another type of problem after appropriate modifications.

Another example is the reservoir problem. The large number of small reservoirs is a unique situation in our country. Starting from the research on the deployment of small reservoirs—that is, starting from "small" and "group"—creating "local" methods, it is very likely that a whole new set of reservoir deployment theories will emerge on the basis of summarization and improvement, far exceeding a certain planning method established by some bourgeois scholars from a few realities or not from reality. Small reservoirs only consider irrigation, and with this experience, the situation of medium-sized reservoirs taking into account both irrigation and power generation will be easier to handle; and further, the deployment of large reservoirs with complex factors such as irrigation, navigation, and power generation will be easier to handle. These considerations of small reservoirs not only create conditions for the research of large reservoirs and act as a pioneer, but also have extremely common and immediate economic effects. If we do this, the emergence of a new mathematical branch with Chinese characteristics on reservoir scheduling can be predicted.

Of course, it is difficult to talk clearly about the formation of future schools of thought today. But if we resolutely support agriculture under the leadership of the Party, we will not only make contributions to national economic construction, but also, as a matter of course, drive many disciplines from this task, and it is very likely that we will create new disciplines and new schools of thought.

While supporting agriculture, we will of course not relax the role of mathematics in other aspects, especially industry, cutting-edge science, transportation, geology and mining, meteorology and water conservancy, engineering and construction, etc. Mathematical workers in China who grew up in the era of Mao Zedong should take on all the mathematical problems that arise in the socialist construction of our country in this era, and work with other scientific workers to solve the mathematical problems in various tasks. Of course, the scope of support for agriculture is broad and there are many problems, so we must concentrate a certain superior force, but the comrades who are left behind must also work hard to meet the needs of other aspects, and at the same time correctly apply the mathematical spirit of rationally allocating manpower to our own team of mathematical workers.

In short, the situation is very good. Mathematics has become a discipline widely welcomed by the masses. The days when mathematics is hoisted high and settles in the commune have begun. In a commune in Jinan, we personally saw this new fact, which moved me to write the following crooked poem:

Once in the city, now on the edge of the earth.
The east wind diligently caresses, green fills thousands of acres.
Planning is used everywhere, mathematics enters the fields.
Whose strength is this transplantation, relying on the Party not on heaven.

    数学工作者要大力为农业服务
    中国科学院数学研究所所长　华罗庚
    农业是基础，工业是主导，工农业同时并举，这是毛主席提出的发展我国国民经济的一条根本方针。为了高速度地发展农业，党中央已经多次向全国发出“支援农业”的号召。全国人民——其中当然也包括全国数学工作者，都积极响应这一号召，抱着满腔热忱，千方百计地为农业服务，或者积极准备为农业服务。这是一件大事。
    近来，全国都在动，并且在许多方面，已经有了很大的成绩。在进一步全面行动，更有计划地行动的时候，“虚瞰”一下数学方法在支援农业中可以在哪些方面起作用，对我们进一步“实干”是会有好处的。
    1、场地选择。如打麦场、稻场、养猪场、粪坑、仓库、机井和这些机井共同使用的变电所，各个建筑工地和公用的水泥搅拌处（或石灰池）等等，都有位置问题或相对的位置问题。位置选得好，可以少跑路，省材料，节约大量劳动力。特别是：愈日常用的设施就愈需要考虑设在最优的位置，因为一日不多，日日许多。这些问题的处理都可以用数学方法来解决。例如：长方形菜地，边上设粪坑，以设在长边中点最好。地内设粪坑，则以中点最好。
    2、劳力组合。劳力组合的问题有两方面：首先由于劳力的不同类型，如少年、成年、妇女等等，以及各类型劳力的体力条件及过去的经验不同，干不同的活就有不同的效率。要保证完成任务而又能发挥最大的劳动效力，就需要用效率比的方法来加以解决。这方法虽然对类型多、工种多的情况还待努力才能普及，但是一般说来，在农村中，类型仅分壮、妇、老，工种也不太多的情况，并不难处理。第二方面，劳力怎样合理分工与安排，也是调度中必须精打细算的问题。一个打麦场上，哪些人卸车，哪些人打，哪些人翻晒，哪些人扬场等，配合得好，就各尽所能，事半功倍，配合得不好，就会如俗话所说的：“乱得跟打麦场一样”，不能发挥每个人的潜力。
    3、作物布局。不同的土壤，不同的灌溉条件，有些适宜于种这样作物，有些适宜种那样作物。对于各种作物的需要又有客观要求，并不准许我们任意地按什么易长就种什么的原则办事。在各种矛盾中考虑出可能范围内的最好方案，就是典型的线性规划的问题。考虑得好，就可以提高产量。更复杂些：如果把复种、间种、轮种种种因素都考虑在内，那本身就将是一个有发展的数学问题。
    4、公社运输。如何合理组织并运用公社的各种交通工具，合理调度，使走的路少，运的东西多，这是线性规划中运输问题的应用与发展。这正是我们可以最先入手的问题，最先入手是因为方法差不多现成，而且又容易普及。当然在“更大更公”的方向上，如果连公社的道路都来一个重新规划，那就更省运力了。
    5、水。算好水账是农业增产的一个重要环节。在夏天我们把水库中的水漫无限制地用了，秋旱无水，岂不要造成损失；如果无打算地把水留着这样有水不用，一方面不能发挥水库最大效益，而且一旦秋雨绵绵，水库溢水，失去控制，还可能造成灾害。因而，水库的量出量入，是一件重要的事。做好“用水预算”，才能做到：水大不过坝，水小够浇灌。
    6、争取最大收获量。如果估计的结果“水”不够了（也许“肥”不够了），在这样的条件下怎样争取最大的收成？当然如果早知道，我们可以合理地布置耐旱作物，使收获量最大。如果事先没有知道，而旱象出现得很突然，那我们就应当考虑最小“牺牲”的问题。而这正是我们可以运用“对策论”（前译“博奕论”）来解决的问题。有人可能说，这样“对策论”的问题可以用普通的线性规划来解决。好！不必争辩，这是一个我们可以尽力的题目。
    7、估计农产。如果能够较正确的早日知道产量，这不但有助于人民公社安排本身的经济，而且对国家制订第二年的建设计划也很有好处。而估计产量正好是我们数学工作者应该做的事。而且只要数学工作者稍加努力，与航空测量队合作，利用航空照相，大面积估产，是完全可以做到的事。
    8、“土、肥、水、种、密、保、管、工”农业“八字宪法”，每一个字都有它的恰当限度，而八个字又是统一的整体。研究每一个字的限度需要数学，而研究八个字之间的错综复杂的关系也需要数学。在这里，可以用相关分析的方法来看出何时何地，哪个因素起主要作用等。而统计学中的实验设计，统计分析等方法的运用更是常见的，就不在此多说了。
    9、渔。水库养鱼，打捞得愈多经济利益愈大。但就繁殖来说，留下来太少了就不易繁殖。怎样才能做到恰到好处？当然渔业专家会根据客观条件定出一个水库养鱼的饱和限度，但怎样来替鱼做“户口调查”，这就是数学工作者所能优为之的事了。而什么样的鱼密度能达到生长最快的可能性，也是一个数学工作者可以参加解决的问题。
    不但“鱼”如此，林业中的狩猎也如此。貂皮是珍贵的，但过分的猎取会导致貂的减少，甚至于绝种。野生的药物（如人参）的采挖也有同样的问题。
    以上所提的方面一定不会是完整的，并且仅仅限于较直接的一些问题。除此之外，如犁面的问题，天气预报问题等显然是需要数学工作者参加工作的。总之，一颗红心——为社会主义农业服务的红心，一面红旗——毛泽东思想的红旗，带往农村，结合千变万化的具体情况，数学工作者是不愁无用武之地的。如果人人能看到问题，人人能创造解决问题的新方法，则公社数学的内容一定会一日千里，无限丰富的。
    我们要搞好这一工作，就要牢记山东的经验（指山东广泛应用运筹学挖掘生产潜力，详细情况参看本报1960年7月29日报道）——把方法交给广大群众。当然就今天的现况来看，我们还不能把以上所提到的所用到的数学知识整个都交给农民群众，但我们有责任化繁为简，化难为易，想尽办法把最有用的方法交给群众。例如：麦场设置问题，在山东经验的基础上，北京提出了“抓各端，最小进一站”的口诀，这个口诀既是定理，又是操作方法。它的意义是，如果有几块麦地有道路相联，比较各端点的产量，把最小的算进下一站。这样一次一次进行，最后所在便是运力最省的麦场。这个方法就易为群众所掌握。又如运输调配中的二十字诀“流向画右傍，对流不应当，里圈与外圈，都无半圈长”，可以在五分钟之内教会搞运输工作的人，来检查运输调配方案是否最好。
    “数学还家”，把数学交给工农群众是一个既定不移的方向。要把这工作做得好，就必须要“简化”，要“浅化”，要创造工具使计算方便简单。因而，数学工作者的任务是双重的，既要向高里钻，又要向低处铺。高里钻，钻入事物的本质，了解其大道理，在许多形式不同的工作中，寻求其共同点，使后之来者可以“学一样，用多方”。而另一方面又要向低处铺，把最有用的数学，讲得最平易，使大家会用。当然，我们并不排斥“知其然，而不知其所以然”的“会用”。但在文化水平逐渐提高后，“水涨船高”，“不知者”就会变为“知者”。逐步高，逐步深，逐步广，逐步宽之后，今日之尖端就会成为他日之常识。这些知其然不知其所以然的事物，正是引人入胜，鼓励人前进的好课题。
    也许有人认为以上所提的各方面“卑之无甚高论”，任务带不动学科。这种看法是不健全的。一来，以上所举的，是大致有把握的，也是比较现成的。在大家深入找问题的时候一定还会有新的好的课题出现，而新的好的课题的生命力一定比这些还要大，一定可以看出更多的道理来。而且就是以上这些，如果我们稍稍回顾二三年来的情况，也就已经可以看出“昨日今朝大不同”的情况了。
    以线性规划而论，几年前知道的人是寥寥无几，而今天则成千上万。以往的理解水平也仅是图上作业法、表上作业法、乘子法、单纯形法的罗列，或各在各法中兜圈子，而今天不但各法有了发展，并且还诸法汇原，知道他们是一脉相联、一理相通的。特别是知道了图上作业法就是表上作业法，在运用上虽然各有短长，而理论上则完全等同。更进一步，一次联立方程是处理未知数与方程式一般多的问题，而线性规划，则是处理方程数少于未知数的问题，至于前所提到的“多因素分析”的问题中又涉及方程数多于未知数的矛盾方程情况（这一现象在实验物理中也常常出现）。因而，有了三法汇原的可能性，同时，也有互相假借、互相启发的可能性，也就是一类问题的现有方法经过适当修改后，可以用到另一类问题上去。
    又如水库问题，小水库为数众多是我国的特有的情况。从小水库的调运研究出发——即从“小”、“群”出发，创造“土”法，很可能在总结提高的基础上出现一整套新的水库调运理论，远远超过若干资产阶级学者从少数实际或不从实际出发而建立的某种规划方法。小水库仅仅考虑灌溉，有了这个经验，中型水库兼顾灌溉、发电的情况就好搞了；再进一步，灌溉、航运、发电等等因素十分复杂的大型水库的调运也就好搞了。这些小水库的考虑不但为大水库的研究创造条件，做了先行官，而且有极其普遍的立竿见影的经济效果。如果这样做，有我国特色的关于水库调度的新的数学分支的出现是可以预卜的。
    当然，对未来学派的形成今天就讲得一清二楚是一件难事。但是如果我们坚决在党的领导下，积极支援农业，则不但会对国民经济建设建立功勋，同时，也会瓜熟蒂落地从这一任务带动不少学科，而且很可能还会创造出新学科、新学派来的。
    在支援农业的同时，我们当然也不放松数学对其它方面的作用，特别是工业、尖端科学、交通运输、地质采矿、气象水利、工程建筑等。生长在毛泽东时代的我国的数学工作者，应当把这一个时代我国社会主义建设中出现的一切数学问题全部包下来，和其他科学工作者在一起去解决各项工作中的数学问题。当然支援农业方面宽，问题多，我们必须集中一定的优势兵力，但留下的工作同志也一定要发愤图强，满足其他各方面的需要，同时也要把合理分配人力的数学精神正确地用到数学工作者自己的队伍中来。
    总之，形势好得很。数学已经成为群众普遍欢迎的学科。高举红旗，使数学在公社落户的日子已经开始，在济南一个公社中我们亲眼看到了这一新生的事实，使我感动得写了下面的一首歪诗：
    向在城市里，今来大地边。
    东风勤拂拭，绿满万顷田。
    规划处处用，数学入田间。
    移植谁之力，靠党非靠天。
