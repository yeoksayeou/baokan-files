The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on October 1st celebrating the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The editorial stated: The revolutionary victory achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong decisively strengthened the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and dealt a heavy blow to the imperialists headed by US imperialism.

The editorial stated that the eleven years of history traversed by the Chinese people are filled with days of victory and glorious pride. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, fundamental changes have taken place in the country's political, economic, and cultural life, rapidly promoting the laying and consolidation of the socialist material and technical foundation.

All the tremendous achievements made by the Chinese people in a historically short period are entirely due to the correct policies and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the result of the enthusiastic and creative labor struggle of the 650 million Chinese people mobilized in response to the Party's call.

The editorial said that the increasingly prosperous and developing socialist power, the People's Republic of China, resolutely opposes the new war provocation schemes of the Western imperialists, headed by US imperialism, and has become a strong fortress for the consolidation of peace and security in the Far East and Asia.

The People's Republic of China has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, actively supported and voiced solidarity with the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national liberation and independence, and provided great assistance to the newly independent young countries in developing their national economies.

The Government of the People's Republic of China has recently once again put forward the proposal to conclude a treaty of mutual non-aggression among countries in the Asian and Pacific region and to turn the entire Asian and Pacific region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

This proposal has received the active support of peace-loving people.

However, the editorial continued, US imperialism, which fears the growing power and increasing international prestige of the People's Republic of China, is forcibly occupying Taiwan, a part of Chinese territory, and is carrying out even more vicious provocative schemes against the People's Republic of China. Due to the frantic obstructionist conspiracies of US imperialism, the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations continues to be hindered. However, no frantic conspiracy of US imperialism can stop the People's Republic of China from advancing, nor can it damage its prestige.

The editorial emphasized that the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the heroic Korean People's Army, dealt a heavy blow to the US imperialist aggressor army and made a great contribution to the victory of the Korean people in the Fatherland Liberation War. The unbreakable friendship and unity of the Korean and Chinese people, linked together by common goals and common ideals, is a powerful material force for striving for peace in the Far East and Asia.

The Korean people, in the big family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, will continue to advance forever together with the fraternal Chinese people. The Korean and Chinese people will unite to fight, smash all the aggressive conspiracies of the common enemy—US imperialism, and must drive US imperialism out of the southern part of our country and Taiwan, an inseparable part of China's territory.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”社论说
    中国人民走过的十一年来的历史
    充满着胜利和光荣的自豪的日子
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”10月1日发表庆祝中华人民共和国建国十一周年的社论。
    社论说：中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下所取得的革命的胜利，决定性地加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力，沉重地打击了以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者。
    社论说，中国人民走过的十一年来的历史，充满着胜利和光荣的自豪的日子。在中国共产党领导下，国家的政治、经济、文化生活上起了根本的变革，迅速地促进了社会主义的物质技术基础的奠定和巩固。
    中国人民在历史上很短期间内取得的这一切巨大成就，完全是由于中国共产党的正确的政策和英明的领导，以及响应党的号召而动员起来的六亿五千万中国人民进行热烈的创造性的劳动斗争的结果。
    社论说，日益繁荣发展的社会主义强国——中华人民共和国坚决反对今天以美帝国主义为首的西方帝国主义者的新战争挑衅阴谋，成为远东和亚洲的巩固的和平和安全的强大的堡垒。
    中华人民共和国始终一贯地实行爱好和平的对外政策，倡导了和平共处五项原则，积极支持和声援争取民族解放和独立的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的斗争，并对新独立的年轻的国家发展民族经济给予了巨大的帮助。
    中华人民共和国政府，最近又一次提出了关于缔结亚洲和太平洋地区各国间互不侵犯的和平公约、把整个亚洲和太平洋地区变为无核武器地区的建议。
    这个建议得到了爱好和平人民的积极的支持。
    但是，社论接着说，害怕中华人民共和国的威力增长和国际威信提高的美帝国主义者，强占着中国领土的一部分——台湾，更加恶毒地进行着反对中华人民共和国的挑衅阴谋。由于美帝国主义的疯狂的阻挠阴谋活动，中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的恢复继续受到阻碍。但是，美帝国主义的任何疯狂阴谋也阻挡不住中华人民共和国的前进，也损毁不了它的威信。
    社论强调说，英勇的中国人民志愿军同英雄的朝鲜人民军一道，沉重地打击了美帝国主义侵略军，为朝鲜人民在祖国解放战争中的胜利作出了巨大的贡献。以共同的目的和共同的思想联结在一起的朝中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊团结，是争取远东和亚洲和平的强有力的物质力量。
    朝鲜人民在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的大家庭中，今后也将永远同兄弟的中国人民一道前进。朝中两国人民将团结起来进行斗争，粉碎共同的敌人——美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋，一定要从我们祖国的南部和中国的不可分割的领土——台湾赶走美帝国主义。
