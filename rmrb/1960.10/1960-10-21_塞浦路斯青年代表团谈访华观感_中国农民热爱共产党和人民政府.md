The Cyprus monthly "New Era" published an article in its September issue on the impressions of the Cyprus Youth Delegation's visit to China. The article, when discussing agriculture, wrote: "The vast rural residents of China have seen their century-long dreams come true, and the products of the fertile land are now their own. They are now able to eat their fill, build houses, and abandon shacks and cellars. They love the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government that freed them from long-term slavery. They extremely hate domestic and foreign despotic rulers, and they most yearn for peace. They support all those who fight for freedom and support the people of our country."

The article also talked about the efforts of a large number of scientists and intellectuals to go to the countryside to develop rural culture. The article said: "We have seen writers, scientists, professors, and artists working with farmers in the countryside and discussing major issues with them, or teaching courses on science, art, etc. at meetings. Now it is not the farmers who go to the scientists and intellectuals, but they who go to the farmers." The article said that even in the most remote areas of China, we saw famous artists in the countryside.

    塞浦路斯青年代表团谈访华观感
    中国农民热爱共产党和人民政府
    塞浦路斯月刊“新时代”9月号刊登了一篇塞浦路斯青年代表团的访华观感的文章。文章在谈到农业时写道：“中国广大的农村居民已看到他们百年的梦想变成现实，肥沃土地上的产品已为他们所有。他们已能吃饱饭，盖起了住房，抛弃了棚屋和地窖，他们热爱使他们摆脱长期的奴隶状态的中国共产党和人民政府，他们极为憎恨国内外的专制统治者，他们最渴望的是和平，他们支持一切为争取自由而战的人们，支持我国人民。”
    文章还谈到大批的科学家和知识分子到农村发展农村文化的努力。文章说：“我们看到，作家、科学家、教授和艺术家在农村中与农民一起劳动并与他们讨论重大问题，或者在会议上讲授关于科学、艺术等等的课程。现在不是农民去找科学家和知识分子，而是他们到农民那儿去。”文章说，甚至在中国最边远的地区，我们也看到了著名的艺术家在农村。
