Xinhua News Agency, 8th October: The African Independence Party sent a telegram congratulating China on its National Day. The text of the telegram is as follows:

	On the occasion of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the African Independence Party congratulates the Chinese people on the great victories they have achieved in the past eleven years under the brilliant leadership of the Communist Party of China, and extends to the Chinese people, its party, and its leaders the warmest congratulations from the African working class and all patriots.

	The tremendous progress China has made in industry, agriculture, and culture demonstrates the inexhaustible strength of your people and sets a beneficial example for all countries engaged in the struggle against imperialism.

	China has only established people's power for eleven years, but in many respects, this country has caught up with France and is prepared to surpass England.

	The tremendous development of China during the Great Leap Forward has shown us what the fate of the working people is in a country where power is in the hands of workers and peasants, under the leadership of a Marxist-Leninist party.

	The African Independence Party fully supports the struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, which is occupied by US imperialism and entrenched by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary gang. The African Independence Party firmly opposes the puppets of Senegal recognizing the Chiang Kai-shek gang.

	The African Independence Party praises China's active assistance to the world liberation movement and China's heroic support for the people of Algeria and the Congo.

	The African Independence Party congratulates the signing of the Sino-Guinean Friendship Treaty, the Sino-Burmese Boundary Agreement, and the recognition of the People's Republic of China by Cuba and the recognition of Cuba by the People's Republic of China. This is a victory against imperialist forces.

	The African Independence Party believes that the United Nations can only have its true meaning after admitting the People's Republic of China and expelling the puppet gang of US imperialism.

	Long live the People's Republic of China!

	Long live the friendship between the Chinese and African peoples!

	Long live the solidarity of the international workers' movement!

	Long live peace!
