Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 10th. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's competition upsurge in increasing steel production is rising wave upon wave. In October, the iron and steel army is advancing victoriously, promoting a continued substantial increase in production. In the first week of October, the daily production level of steel, iron ore, coke, and other products exceeded the first ten-day target of the "100-Day Great Leap Forward."

The vast number of workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company have participated in the joint tackling of key technical problems and performance competitions since the first day (September 22nd) of the "100-Day Great Leap Forward." More than 1,400 leaders at all levels from Anshan Iron and Steel Company to various factories and mines, some went to the front line to "serve as soldiers," personally attacking key production problems, and some went to key work sections, teams, or weak links, concurrently serving as party branch secretaries or administrative leaders, specifically organizing workers to break through key problems. The workers in each production unit conquered a key problem, consolidated it, and then attacked another. The steelworkers who fought day and night on the main attack front pushed the steel production level to a new peak as soon as they entered October after the key production problems were conquered one after another. The contest between open hearth furnaces promoted the enthusiasm of both sides to become more and more energetic; the relay race between the four shifts promoted the competition upsurge to be higher than the previous wave; the benchmark selection competition of the same type of work not only selected advanced role models to catch up with, but also summarized a complete set of advanced experiences. Various forms of competition converged into a huge driving force to overcome key production problems and promote continuous leaps in production. At the beginning of the "100-Day Great Leap Forward," the workers of the No. 11 open hearth furnace in the Second Steelmaking Plant launched a fast steelmaking technical performance competition targeting the key problem of long steelmaking time. The new record of fast steelmaking was constantly being refreshed. Class C used 7 minutes and 20 seconds to make a furnace of steel, Class B used 6 minutes and 20 seconds to make a furnace, and Class C reduced the time to 6 minutes and 10 seconds. The achievements of No. 11 open hearth furnace inspired all the workers in the plant, and immediately set off a competition upsurge to learn from No. 11 and catch up with No. 11. After the open hearth furnaces in the entire plant launched a fast steelmaking competition, the average smelting time of each furnace of steel in the first week of October was shortened by 46 minutes compared with September, and the daily production level increased by 5.5%.

In order to overfulfill the steel production plan, the workers in each factory and mine created conditions for increasing steel production in the long-line cooperation competition. The workers of the Chemical Plant not only ensured the daily completion of the coke production plan, but also improved the strength of the coke by 2.1% compared with the plan, creating favorable conditions for the blast furnace to increase pig iron production.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 10th. The workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company have launched a performance competition to produce more steel and better steel, and steel production has increased substantially. From October 1st to 7th, the average daily steel production level greatly exceeded the same period in September. The output on the 6th exceeded 1.4 times the average daily output in September, setting a new record since the company began steelmaking.

The workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company started a vigorous high-yield week movement throughout the company at the end of September, and all parties cooperated to jointly promote a substantial increase in steel production. Han Ningfu, deputy secretary of the company's party committee, and leaders at all levels of the company went deep into the front lines of each production unit to specifically lead the tackling key problems competition. The workers of the steelmaking plant launched a "one-way main attack" (open hearth furnace), "four-way cooperation" (mechanical and electrical, raw materials, ingot casting, and operation) performance competition with one heart and one mind. The No. 3 open hearth furnace worked diligently to repair the furnace and check key points, ensuring that the slag outlet was smooth, and the steel slag did not fall to the ground. At the same time, it also expanded the charging volume, greatly shortened the smelting time, and greatly increased the steel output. Auxiliary workers also went all out in cooperating with the steelworkers in tackling and guarding key problems. Charging machine drivers Lu Dianrong and Li Chuwen competed with each other, overcame the charging problem, and improved work efficiency by two times compared with the past for each charging. Crane driver assistants Hu Liangbo and Gao Hongjin launched a head-to-head competition, creating a new record of completing three cans of molten iron in five minutes and thirty seconds.

During the high-yield and high-quality week from September 29th to October 5th, the daily steel output increased by 39% compared with September, and the output of pig iron, coke, and ore also increased substantially.

    钢铁战士抓紧每天每旬　竞赛热潮一浪高过一浪
    鞍山钢铁公司生产持续上升
    武钢职工紧密协作，多出好钢的攻关表演赛轰轰烈烈
    据新华社鞍山10日电　鞍山钢铁公司增产钢的竞赛热潮一浪高过一浪，各路钢铁大军在10月份乘胜前进，推动生产继续大幅度上升。10月第一周，钢铁和铁矿石、焦炭等产品的日产水平，都超过了“大干一百天”的头一旬指标。
    鞍钢广大职工从“大干一百天”的头一天（9月22日）开始，就几乎全部参加了联合攻关技术表演竞赛。从鞍钢公司到各厂矿，一千四百多名各级领导干部，有的到第一线“当兵”，亲自动手攻打生产关键，有的下到关键工段、班组或薄弱环节，兼任党支部书记或行政领导职务，具体组织职工突破关键。各生产单位的职工攻下一关，巩固一关，再攻一关。日夜奋战在主攻战线上的炼钢工人，在生产关键接连被攻克后，一进入10月便把炼钢生产水平推上了新高峰。平炉对平炉的对手赛，促进竞赛双方的干劲越鼓越足；四班之间的接力赛，推动竞赛的热潮一浪更比一浪高；同工种的标兵选拔赛，不仅各自选出追赶的先进榜样，而且总结了成套的先进经验。各种各样形式的竞赛，汇集成攻克生产关键、推动生产不断跃进的巨大动力。“大干一百天”一开始，第二炼钢厂十一号平炉职工，便针对炼钢时间长这一关键，展开了快速炼钢技术表演赛，快速炼钢的新纪录不断被刷新，丙班用七点二十分钟炼一炉钢，乙班就用六点二十分钟炼一炉，丙班又把炼一炉钢的时间缩短到六点零十分。十一号平炉的成就鼓舞了全厂职工，立刻掀起了学十一号、赶十一号的竞赛热潮。全厂平炉展开快速炼钢竞赛之后，10月第一周平均每炉钢的冶炼时间，比9月份缩短了四十六分钟，日产水平因而增长了5.5％。
    为了超额完成产钢计划，各厂矿职工在一条龙协作赛中，都为增产钢创造条件。化工总厂职工，不仅保证日日完成产焦计划，焦炭的强度也比计划提高了2.1％，为高炉增产生铁创造了有利条件。
    新华社武汉10日电　武汉钢铁公司职工掀起了多出钢、出好钢的攻关表演赛，钢产量大幅度上升。10月1日至7日，钢的平均日产水平大大超过了9月同期，其中6日的产量超过9月平均日产量的一点四倍，创造了全公司炼钢以来的最高纪录。
    武钢职工从9月末开始，就在全公司开展了轰轰烈烈的高产周运动，各方面协作共同促进钢的大幅度增产。公司党委副书记韩宁夫和全公司各级领导干部，深入各生产单位的第一线，具体领导攻关赛。炼钢厂职工开展了“一路主攻”（平炉）、“四路配合”（机电、原料、注锭、运转）一条心、一股劲的攻关表演赛。三号平炉做到勤补炉、勤检查关键，使出渣口畅通、钢渣不落地，同时也扩大了装入量，冶炼时间大大缩短，出钢量大大增加。辅助工人在配合炼钢工人攻关、守关中，也全力以赴。装料机司机路殿荣、李处文互相竞赛，攻下装料关，每装一次料比过去提高工效两倍。吊车司机助手胡良伯、高洪金开展对手竞赛，创造了五分三十秒兑完三罐铁水的新纪录。
    在9月29日到10月5日这一高产优质周中，钢的日产量比9月份增长了39％，生铁、焦炭、矿石的产量也大大上升。
