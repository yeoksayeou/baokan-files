Xinhua News Agency, 2nd October: A grand rally of 100,000 people from all walks of life in the capital was held today to warmly celebrate the signing of the historically significant Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, and to celebrate the great victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The grand occasion of today's meeting marks a new high tide in the friendship between the two peoples during this Sino-Burmese Friendship Year.

At the meeting, the two Premiers unanimously emphasized the great historical significance of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty is a milestone in the further development of friendly relations between China and Burma, a brilliant example of friendly coexistence among the people of Asian countries, and a good model for Asian countries to resolve boundary issues and other disputes. Premier U Nu said that the successful conclusion of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty is the result of the two countries' observance and implementation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said: It is precisely because the People's Republic of China adheres to these five principles that our two countries have been able to freely, voluntarily, and satisfactorily sign the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty.

These words of Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier U Nu were warmly welcomed by the 100,000 people.

The grand celebration began at 2:30 p.m. When Premier Zhou Enlai and others accompanied Premier U Nu and General Ne Win and other Burmese guests to the rostrum of the meeting, the band played a welcome song, and 100,000 people in the Beijing Workers' Stadium stood up, waving the national flags of China and Burma and flowers, warmly welcoming the Burmese guests with long and thunderous applause.

Seated on the rostrum were also Vice Premiers He Long, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, Luo Ruiqing, and Xi Zhongxun; Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Saifudin, Cheng Qian, Panchen Erdeni Chokyi Gyaltsen, and Lin Feng; Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Geng Biao; Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Liu Ren; Vice Mayor of Beijing Wan Li; Chinese Ambassador to Burma Li Yimang; Vice Governor of Yunnan Province Liu Minghui; and responsible persons of various government departments and Beijing Municipality.

All the distinguished guests of the Burmese government delegation, the Burmese delegation of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee headed by Brigadier General Aung Gyi, the Burmese military friendship delegation headed by Brigadier General Maung Maung, the Burmese cultural delegation headed by Colonel So Min, the Burmese sports delegation headed by Lieutenant Colonel Maung Win, the Burmese trade delegation headed by U Khin, the Burmese news delegation headed by U Khin, Burmese Ambassador to China Kyao Winn and embassy officials, and Burmese students in Beijing were all invited to attend the meeting. The Burmese guests were warmly welcomed at the meeting, and a group of children presented flowers to the guests.

Envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries to China were also invited to attend the meeting.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke amid thunderous applause. He said: Today, people from all walks of life in Beijing, the capital of China, are holding a grand meeting here to celebrate the signing of the Boundary Treaty between The People's Republic of China and The Union of Burma. Let us warmly congratulate this great happy event of this year, the Sino-Burmese Friendship Year.

Premier Zhou said that the Sino-Burmese boundary issue is a problem left over from history and also a product of imperialist aggression policies. However, because the two governments have always cherished the traditional friendship between the two countries and safeguarded the fundamental interests of the independence of the two countries and peace in Asia, they have taken into account both the historical background and the current actual situation when resolving the boundary issue, and have determined the principles of mutual understanding, mutual accommodation, and friendly consultation. After the joint efforts of both parties, a final agreement was finally reached and a boundary treaty was signed. He said that the signing of the boundary treaty between the two countries marks a new high tide in the friendly relations between China and Burma. Premier Zhou, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, expressed his gratitude and respect to the Government of the Union of Burma, to His Excellency Premier U Nu, to His Excellency General Ne Win, and to all Burmese friends who have contributed to the resolution of the Sino-Burmese boundary issue and the signing of the Sino-Burmese boundary treaty.

Premier Zhou emphasized: The signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty has comprehensively and thoroughly resolved the complex issue that the people of China and Burma have been eager to resolve for decades, making the Sino-Burmese border, which stretches for more than 2,000 kilometers, a border of peace and friendship. This will not only bring peace and happiness to the residents of the Sino-Burmese border area, but also benefit the peaceful construction and friendly cooperation of the people of China and Burma. The Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty is a milestone in the further development of friendly relations between China and Burma, a brilliant example of friendly coexistence among the people of Asian countries, and a good model for Asian countries to resolve boundary issues and other disputes.

Premier Zhou pointed out: Imperialists and their followers are very unhappy about the rational resolution of the Sino-Burmese boundary issue and the development of Sino-Burmese friendly relations. A small handful of ill-intentioned people, in order to promote their policies of aggression and expansion, are always trying their best to undermine the unity of the Chinese and Burmese people. They try to sow discord. However, the development of the facts is completely contrary to their wishes, and their vicious conspiracy to use the boundary issue to undermine Sino-Burmese friendly relations has been shamefully bankrupt. He said that our warm celebration here today of the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty is the most powerful answer to them and the heaviest blow to them.

Premier Zhou Enlai also said that the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty once again proves that the peaceful foreign policy pursued by the Chinese government is unwavering. The Chinese government not only hopes to live in friendship with its neighbors, but also hopes to practice peaceful coexistence with all countries with the same aspirations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said that the Chinese people will continue to fight together with the Burmese people and all peace-loving people against aggression and to safeguard peace. As long as the people of all countries in the world further unite, support each other, and persist in the struggle, the imperialist policies of aggression and war can certainly be defeated. The people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the whole world will surely win independence, win progress, win peace, and win victory.

Premier Zhou's speech was constantly interrupted by warm applause.

When Premier U Nu spoke at the meeting, the entire venue once again resounded with thunderous applause. He said that our two countries have finally resolved a long-standing issue that has existed between the two countries for more than a thousand years, and this resolution was reached by the two countries in a manner that was satisfactory, voluntary, friendly, and harmonious to both sides.

Premier U Nu said: I am convinced that one of the factors that made such a treaty possible was the undeniable fact that Sino-Burmese friendship has a solid and firm foundation laid down in history.

Premier U Nu said: We have a responsibility to accurately delineate the parts of our two countries' common border that have not yet been demarcated. This is not an easy task. This is a noble task that must be undertaken in good faith, based on the interests of our two countries and the interests of world peace.

Premier U Nu said that the foundation of the friendship between our two countries has always been solid and reliable. The boundary treaty we signed yesterday is a great and magnificent building of common friendship built on this solid foundation. Our task from now on is not to let the great and beautiful building of friendship that we have created deteriorate, but to do everything in our power to protect and maintain this building, so that it will always remain new, magnificent, brilliant, and glorious. Maintaining the original solidity and brilliance of the building of Sino-Burmese friendship is not only the task of this generation of the people of China and Burma, but also the task that future generations of the two countries must bear, so that this building of friendship can always remain brilliant and unblemished for generations.

Premier U Nu pointed out that the successful conclusion of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty is the result of the two countries' observance and implementation of these five principles. He said that in the future, if we adhere to these five principles in all our actions, the great building of friendship that our two countries have established yesterday will not only remain unshakable, but will also become more solemn and beautiful.

He reiterated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by the two Premiers. He said that if we carefully consider these five principles, we will understand that these are the principles that every country in the world should observe and implement in the current world situation.

He said: It is precisely because The People's Republic of China has implemented these five principles that the Sino-Burmese boundary issue, which had not been resolved for nearly a hundred years, has finally been completely resolved. It is precisely because The People's Republic of China adheres to these five principles that our two countries have been able to freely, voluntarily, and satisfactorily sign the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty.

Premier U Nu said: On our side, because we believe in the effectiveness and vitality of the five principles, we will also fully adhere to these principles in the future. In our relations with all other countries, we will sincerely and faithfully implement these principles and use them as a guide, just as a traveler uses a bright light as a guide in the dark night.

Premier U Nu finally said: We fully believe that you will also handle your relations with other countries in the same way, adhering to these principles and using them as a guiding light.

Premier U Nu finally shouted enthusiastically in Chinese: "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long live Chairman Liu Shaoqi!" "Long live Premier Zhou Enlai!" "Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!" At this time, the entire venue immediately resounded with thunderous and warm applause.

At the beginning of the meeting, the band of more than 500 people solemnly played the national anthems of Burma and China.

At the beginning of the meeting, Vice Mayor of Beijing Wan Li delivered the opening speech. On behalf of all the people of Beijing, he extended the warmest welcome and the most sincere thanks to His Excellency Premier U Nu and His Excellency General Ne Win and all the Burmese guests who attended our National Day celebrations yesterday and are here today to attend this celebration meeting. He said: The signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty is not only a historically significant milestone in the development of Sino-Burmese friendly relations, but also an outstanding contribution to maintaining peace in Asia and the world. We believe that the conclusion of this treaty will not only be warmly supported by the people of China and Burma, but will also be universally praised and warmly welcomed by all peace-loving countries and people in the world.

The formal signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty has added to the joy of the festive Beijing. Today, the meeting was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere. The magnificent Beijing Workers' Stadium was crowded with people and filled with joy. Under the warm and pleasant autumn sunshine, the masses attending the meeting dressed in festive costumes, holding bouquets of various colors, decorated the Workers' Stadium into a colorful garden. Festive vermilion ribbons were tied to the grandstand railings, and huge slogans were hung high around the venue: "Celebrate the Signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty!" "Celebrate the Great Victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence!" "Let the Sino-Burmese Border Always Be a Border of Peace and Friendship!" On top of the surrounding grandstands, red flags fluttered in the wind, and countless brilliant electric lights formed huge illuminated slogans in golden splendor: "Long live Sino-Burmese Friendship!" "Long live the Great Unity of the People of the World!"

After the celebration meeting, Premier Zhou Enlai, Premier U Nu, General Ne Win, and others, together with Chinese and foreign guests and people from all walks of life who attended the celebration meeting, watched the performances of the cane ball team and boxing team of the Burmese sports delegation visiting our country, and the friendly match between the Burmese sports delegation football team and our "August 1st" football team. At the end of the performance, Premier Zhou Enlai, Premier U Nu, General Ne Win, Vice Premier He Long, Vice Premier Luo Ruiqing, and Vice Mayor of Beijing Wan Li went to the sports field to shake hands with the athletes of the cane ball team, boxing team, and football team of the Burmese sports delegation and the athletes of our "August 1st" football team one by one, and took a group photo together.

    新华社2日讯　首都各界十万人今天举行盛大隆重的集会，热烈庆祝具有历史意义的中缅边界条约的签订，庆祝和平共处五项原则的伟大胜利。今天大会的盛况，标志着在这中缅友好年里，两国人民的友谊达到了一个新的高潮。
    两国总理在大会上一致强调了中缅边界条约的巨大历史意义。周恩来总理说，中缅边界条约是中缅两国友好关系进一步发展的里程碑，是亚洲各国人民友好相处的光辉榜样，是亚洲各国之间解决边界问题和其他争端的良好范例。吴努总理说，中缅边界条约的圆满缔结，正是两国遵守和执行和平共处五项原则的结果。他说：正由于中华人民共和国信守这五项原则，所以我们两国有可能自由、自愿和使双方满意地签订了中缅边界条约。
    周恩来总理和吴努总理的这些话受到了十万群众的热烈欢迎。
    盛大的庆祝会在下午二时三十分开始。当周恩来总理等陪同吴努总理和奈温将军等缅甸贵宾登上大会主席台的时候，乐队奏欢迎曲，北京工人体育场上十万群众全体起立，他们挥舞着中缅两国国旗和鲜花，以长时间的暴风雨般的掌声热烈欢迎缅甸贵宾。
    在主席台上就座的，还有贺龙、陈毅、聂荣臻、罗瑞卿、习仲勋副总理，沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通、赛福鼎、程潜、班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞、林枫副委员长，外交部副部长章汉夫、耿飚，中共北京市委第二书记刘仁，北京市副市长万里，中国驻缅甸大使李一氓，云南省副省长刘明辉，以及政府各部门和北京市的负责人。
    缅甸政府代表团的全体贵宾，以昂季准将为首的中缅边界联合委员会缅方代表团，以貌貌准将为首的缅甸军事友好代表团，以苏敏上校为首的缅甸文化代表团，以貌温中校为首的缅甸体育代表团，以吴妙为首的缅甸贸易代表团，以吴钦为首的缅甸新闻代表团，缅甸驻中国大使叫温和使馆官员，在京的缅甸留学生，都应邀参加了大会。缅甸贵宾们在大会上受到了热烈的欢迎，一群少年儿童向贵宾们献了鲜花。
    各国驻中国的使节和外交官员也应邀参加了大会。
    周恩来总理在暴风雨般的掌声中讲话，他说：今天，中国首都北京各界在这里举行盛大的集会，庆祝中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦边界条约的签订。让我们对今年、中缅友好年的大喜事热烈祝贺吧。
    周总理说，中缅边界问题是历史上遗留下来的问题，同时，也是帝国主义侵略政策的产物。但是由于两国政府一贯珍视两国的传统友谊和维护两国独立和亚洲和平的根本利益，在解决边界问题的时候，既考虑历史背景，又考虑当前实际情况，确定了互谅互让和友好协商的方针。经过双方的共同努力，终于达成了最后协议，签订了边界条约。他说，两国边界条约的签订，标志着中缅两国的友好关系达到了新的高潮。周总理代表中国人民和中国政府，向缅甸联邦政府，向吴努总理阁下，奈温将军阁下，向所有对中缅边界问题的解决和中缅边界条约的签订作出贡献的缅甸朋友们，表示感谢和敬意。
    周总理强调说：中缅边界条约的签订，全面地彻底地解决了几十年来中缅两国人民一直渴望解决的复杂问题，使长达两千多公里的中缅边界，成为和平友好的边界。这不仅使中缅边境的居民能够得到安宁和幸福，而且有利于中缅两国人民的和平建设和友好合作。中缅边界条约是中缅两国友好关系进一步发展的里程碑，是亚洲各国人民友好相处的光辉榜样，是亚洲各国之间解决边界问题和其他争端的良好范例。
    周总理指出：帝国主义及其追随者对中缅边界问题的合理解决和中缅友好关系的发展，感到很不高兴。有那么一小撮不怀好意的人，为了推行他们的侵略扩张政策，总是千方百计地破坏中缅人民的团结。他们力图进行挑拨离间。可是，事实的发展完全同他们的愿望相反，他们利用边界问题破坏中缅友好关系的恶毒阴谋是可耻地破产了。他说，今天我们在这里热烈祝贺中缅边界条约的签订，就是给予他们最有力的答复，也是给予他们最沉重的打击。
    周恩来总理还说，中缅边界条约的签订，再一次证明了中国政府所执行的和平外交政策是坚定不移的。中国政府不仅希望同自己的邻邦友好相处，并且希望在和平共处五项原则的基础上同所有具有同样愿望的国家实行和平共处。他说，中国人民将继续同缅甸人民和一切爱好和平的人民一起，为反对侵略、维护和平而斗争。只要世界各国人民进一步团结起来，互相支持，坚持斗争，帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策是一定可以击败的。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民和全世界人民必将赢得独立，赢得进步，赢得和平，赢得胜利。
    周总理的讲话，不断为热烈的掌声所打断。
    吴努总理在大会上讲话的时候，全场再一次响起了暴风雨般的掌声。他说，我们两国已经最后解决了两国间存在了一千多年的一个长期的问题，而且这个解决是两国在双方满意、自愿、友好、和谐的情况下达成的。
    吴努总理说：我确信，使得这样一个条约能够成功地缔结的因素之一，就是中缅友谊存在着历史上奠定下来的坚实牢固的基础，这样一个无可否认的事实。
    吴努总理说：我们有责任确切地划定我们两国共同边界中尚未标定的部分。这不是一件轻而易举的事。这是一个崇高的任务，必须从我们两国的利益出发，从世界和平的利益出发，抱着善意来从事这个任务。
    吴努总理说，我们两国的友谊的基础历来就是巩固和可靠的。昨天我们签订的边界条约就是一座建筑在这个坚固基础上的伟大和壮丽的共同友谊的大厦。我们今后的任务就是不让我们所创立的这座伟大和美丽的友谊大厦败坏，而要尽我们的一切力量保护和维持这座大厦，使它永远保持新颖、华丽、灿烂和光荣。保持中缅友谊大厦原来的坚固和光辉，不但是中缅两国人民这一代人的任务，也是两国后代子孙所必须负担的任务，以使这座友谊大厦能世世代代一直永保光彩而不受污损。
    吴努总理指出，中缅边界条约的圆满缔结，正是两国遵守和执行这五项原则的结果。他说，在将来，如果我们在一切行动中都信守这五项原则，我们两国昨天建立起来的伟大的友谊大厦不但将保持坚固不移，而且会变得更加庄严和美丽。
    他重申两国总理所共同创导的和平共处五项原则。他说，如果我们仔细思考这五项原则，我们就会懂得这是目前世界形势下世界上每一个国家都应当遵守和实行的原则。
    他说：正因为中华人民共和国实行了这五项原则，所以将近一百年没有解决的中缅边界问题最后有可能得到彻底的解决。正因为中华人民共和国信守这五项原则，所以我们两国有可能自由、自愿和使双方满意地签订了中缅边界条约。
    吴努总理说：在我们方面，由于我们相信五项原则的有效性和生命力，我们今后也将完全信守这些原则。在我国同所有其他国家的关系中，我们将真诚和忠实地实行这些原则，以它们为向导，正如一个旅行者在黑夜里以一个明亮的光为向导一样。
    吴努总理最后说：我们完全相信你们也会同样地处理你们同其他国家的关系，信守这些原则，并且以它们为指路的明灯。
    吴努总理最后用中国话热情地高呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！”“刘少奇主席万岁！”“周恩来总理万岁！”“中缅友好万岁！”这时，全场立即响起了暴风雨般的热烈的掌声。
    大会开始的时候，五百多人组成的乐队庄严地奏缅中两国国歌。
    大会开始时，北京市副市长万里致开会词。他以北京市全体人民的名义，向昨天参加我国国庆典礼、今天又来参加这个庆祝大会的吴努总理阁下和奈温将军阁下以及全体缅甸贵宾们，表示最热烈的欢迎和最诚挚的感谢。他说：中缅边界条约的签订，不但在中缅友好关系的发展中是一个具有历史意义的里程碑，而且对维护亚洲和世界和平也是一个卓越的贡献。我们相信，这个条约的缔结，不仅将得到中缅两国人民的热烈支持，也一定会得到全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的普遍赞扬和热烈欢迎。
    中缅边界条约的正式签订，使得节日的北京喜上加喜。今天，大会上充满了热烈友好的气氛。宏伟的北京工人体育场上人山人海，喜气洋洋。在和煦宜人的秋阳照耀下，穿着节日服装的到会群众，拿着各色花束，把工人体育场点缀成了一片五彩缤纷的大花园。看台栏杆上系结着喜庆的朱红色彩绸，场内四周高悬巨幅标语：“庆祝中缅边界条约的签订！”“庆祝和平共处五项原则的伟大胜利！”“让中缅边界永远成为和平友好的边界！”在周围的看台顶上，红旗迎风招展，无数灿烂的电灯，组成了金色闪烁的巨大的灯光标语：“中缅友好万岁！”“世界人民大团结万岁！”
    庆祝大会结束以后，周恩来总理、吴努总理、奈温将军等，同参加庆祝大会的中外来宾和各界群众一起，观看了前来我国访问的缅甸体育代表团藤球代表队、拳击代表队的表演和缅甸体育代表团足球队同我国“八一”足球队的友谊比赛。表演结束时，周恩来总理、吴努总理、奈温将军、贺龙副总理、罗瑞卿副总理和北京市副市长万里，到运动场上同缅甸体育代表团的藤球代表队、拳击代表队和足球队运动员以及我国“八一”足球队运动员一一握手，并在一起合影。（附图片）
