	Establishing a Home in the Deep Mountains and Old Forests
	——A Record of the Model Deeds of National Agricultural Labor Model Hou Tingren in Building the Mountainous Areas
	Our Newspaper Reporters Cao Baoming, Tian Zhuang, Li Jinkai
	In the past two years, Hou Tingren, the director of the State-owned Hubei Zhuxi Comprehensive Farm, has often been followed by young men and women from the plains who firmly demand to participate in labor in this mountainous farm. Old Hou says, "High mountains and plains are all for construction!" They say, "Mountain construction needs people even more." Old Hou says, "It's very hard in the high mountains." They say, "You, at your age, are not afraid, and we young people are even less afraid." In short, they won't give up until they achieve their goal.
	Indeed, how can these ideal-rich young people not run to the high mountains? Old Hou himself is someone who drills straight into the deep mountains and old forests as soon as he sees them. In just a few years, this farm has developed from Sanheba in the low-mountain area to Qishuping in the mid-mountain area, and further to Jue Longling and Yunwu Creek in the high mountains at an altitude of 2,200 meters. They have developed more than 200 mountains in an area of 360 li from north to south and 130 li from east to west. They grow grain, raise cattle and sheep, develop medicinal materials, and run factories on these high mountains where the sun is above and the white clouds are below. Without receiving a single penny from the state, they have now accumulated more than 2 million yuan of wealth for the state. Recently, in Yangjiapa – an old forest belonging to the Daba Mountains – they have used the mountain torrents as power to build thirteen small factories such as hydropower stations, machinery factories, and berberine factories, as well as more than seventy worker dormitories. It seems that this old Shuba, which originally had only two households and three people, is about to become an industrial town.

	With the Masses, There are Ways
	When the farm was founded in Sanheba, there was only Old Hou, two dilapidated houses, and fifty-four mu of white sandy land. There were no plowing cattle or farming tools at all. Old Hou came here and pondered for several days without knowing what to do. County Magistrate Duan Jingxiu discussed with him how to run the farm. Old Hou thought for a while and said, "Let's allocate some funds to buy plowing cattle and farming tools first!" The county magistrate smiled and said, "Farmers can support a large family by planting a few mu of land, and now you have fifty-four mu of land, and you still want funds? Old Hou, our country was made poor by the reactionaries. We have no money, but we must do things that require money!" Then, the county magistrate asked him, "Have you gone through land reform?" "Yes." "That's good. How was land reform done? We communists must rely on the masses in everything, and mobilize the masses." This brightened Old Hou's heart.
	Hou Tingren returned to Sanheba and decided to find a way to mobilize the masses. One day, he saw Tu Xueming, a poor peasant in his seventies, leading his young son in the field to thresh grain. The young man didn't know how to thresh, and scattered the grain everywhere. He stepped forward and said, "This way of threshing won't work!" As he spoke, he helped to do it. He took the grain stalks, winnowed them openly, bundled them heavily, and didn't spill a grain outside the bucket. He also tied the straw neatly and crisply, delighting Old Man Tu, who educated his son, "Boy, look how he's threshing! You must learn well. It takes ten years to become a *juren*, but you can't become a farming expert." Old Hou helped Old Man Tu thresh grain for a day, and the old man also invited him to eat together and asked him about his situation in detail. He explained the instructions of the county party committee, and the old man said, "Did the Party send you here to run the farm? That's good. I have three sons, and the cattle are readily available. If you have any difficulties, just tell me. We poor and lower-middle peasants will help you." In this way, Old Hou began to establish a close relationship of exchanging labor with the masses. He got up early and worked late, helping people during the day and borrowing farming tools to cultivate the farm at night. When it came time for the farm to plant wheat, several poor peasants came with their people and cattle, and twenty-four Party and League members from the township also carried loads of fertilizer to help Old Hou plant the wheat properly.

	Socialism is Built by People
	A year later, the farm used its own income to pay off its debts and added plowing cattle and farming tools. It also absorbed six workers. Old Hou deeply realized that "Socialism is built by people, not bought with money." We must build the country diligently and frugally, listen to the Party, firmly rely on the masses, and work hard.
	After the farm took root at the foot of the mountain, it further developed to the mountainside Luojiapo. Here, the sunshine and water sources were abundant, and there was also a dense patch of good pasture, suitable for both farming and grazing, but there were many wild boars. The first day they went up the mountain, a group of wild boars took the opportunity while they were out chopping firewood to drill into the thatched shed and overturn the stove. They persisted in planting grain and grazing cattle and sheep here, and built this place into a base for advancing to the high mountains.
	According to the instructions of the county party committee, the farm, according to the characteristics of the mountainous area, had to grow grain and also develop diversified operations and vigorously develop medicinal material production. Old Hou learned that there were many wild *Coptis chinensis* seedlings in Yunwu Creek in the high mountains near the Sichuan border, so he immediately took five workers, including Yin Xugang and Xiao Decai, to collect them in this deep mountain forest of about 100 or 200 li. Old Hou and the others first made big steamed buns weighing two *jin* each with thirty *jin* of flour in Fengxi Town and brought them along. They climbed over the Yanwangbian and Guimenguan, where there was a hundred-zhang abyss at their feet, before entering this forest. Inside, tall pine, fir, and birch trees grew densely, as well as various fruit trees such as chestnuts, walnuts, water pears, and star fruit, and various medicinal materials such as *Eucommia ulmoides* and *Angelica sinensis*. In the mountains and forests, clear spring water flowed gurglingly, and the black oily soil was several feet thick. However, this good place was not developed, allowing the leaves and wild fruits to ripen and fall, and pile up on the ground to a thickness of more than a foot. In this deep mountain and dense forest, they searched for *Coptis chinensis* seedlings during the day and lit a bonfire at night, sleeping back-to-back. They searched for five days in a row, but could not find any *Coptis chinensis* seedlings. On the day when their dry food was about to run out, they finally discovered that *Coptis chinensis* seedlings, resembling coriander, grew in the dense shade of the forest, one patch after another, extremely numerous. They pulled up 110,000 seedlings in one go, tightened their belts, and carried them out of the mountains.
	They used this batch of wild seedlings to start the first shed of *Coptis chinensis*, and later developed it into dozens of sheds and hundreds of sheds. They also cultivated dozens of wild medicinal materials into domestic medicinal materials. As production developed, Old Hou increasingly believed that those deep mountain and old forests rarely visited by people were gold mountains and silver dens, with endless treasures. When the farm was preparing for major development, he braved the wind and snow to survey the deep mountains for more than a month. He wanted to develop all the mountains that no one had developed; he wanted to manage all the old forests that no one had managed. He took a fancy to dozens of mountain forests at once.

	Decentralize and Develop Locally
	But how to develop to so many places? Old Hou calculated that after five years of operation, they only had four teams of forty-two people and 100,000 yuan in assets, which was not enough to allocate. County Party Secretary Yan Huaizhi gave him an idea: "The farm only had you alone at the beginning. This time, you should implement the method of 'three people in a small team and five people in a large team', send all the backbone out, and let them develop from small to large, locally." Old Hou conveyed this opinion at the Party and League member meeting, saying: "Starting a business is like picking soil with a needle, and ruining a family is like waves pushing sand. Although we are stronger than before, we must pay attention to diligence and frugality in everything, saving money and people." Party member Yin Xugang – a worker who had been forced into the mountains to chop firewood by the reactionaries since he was a child – immediately signed up to go to Fangjiaping. Before leaving, he went to the store to buy a load of new manure buckets, thinking as he walked, "Director Hou only brought an umbrella when he started the farm, and I only spent three yuan to buy this load of buckets." Who knew he would run into Old Hou, who smiled and said, "The farm has plenty of old buckets, find them and repair them, and they'll be as good as new, why buy new ones?" He thought, yes, I'm not frugal enough, and immediately returned the new buckets. He and three team members arrived at Fangjiaping, covered in snow, and it was already dark. This old forest, which had not been visited by anyone for a long time, didn't even have a dilapidated thatched shed, so they lay down under a protruding rock for the night. They got up early the next morning to take a closer look. Not only was the water good and the soil fertile, but the slope was gentle, which was perfect for planting medicinal materials. They immediately went to cut down trees to build thatched sheds and reclaim wasteland, and successively planted forty mu of *Scrophularia ningpoensis* and eighty mu of sugar beets. In the first year, the four of them had an income of more than 7,000 yuan.
	Yin Xugang and the others set an example of diligence and frugality in building the team, and the whole farm immediately launched a wave of "learning from Old Yin and catching up with Old Yin". Everyone only carried a load of buckets and a pot, and set off into the mountains with a few hoes and machetes. While planting medicinal materials, they also separately, according to the complex natural conditions of the mountainous area that "every ten feet higher is different, and the *yin* and *yang* slopes are very different", planted corn and oats in the mid-mountain area, planted string beans and potatoes in the high mountains, and planted climbing beans in the rock crevices, asking the high mountains for both grain and money. Their farm has also developed from the initial one person to the current forty-two teams and more than nine hundred people.
	The fastest growing is the Dayuan Production Team led by Wang Zhongshan, who is known as "Little Hou Tingren." Wang Zhongshan is only nineteen years old this year. Four years ago, when he came to the farm with a small bag, Old Hou saw that he was small and only assigned him to look after a sheep and a cow. Under the influence and leadership of this group of wasteland developers, Wang Zhongshan had been trained into an excellent herdsman in a few years. During the major development, he drove twenty cattle alone, walked a long way, and climbed a mountain ridge near Shaanxi. The ridge was flat, with tens of thousands of *mu* of land. Together with two young people of similar age that he recruited along the way, he set up a livestock farm on this mountain ridge called Dayuan. Now, his team has grown to ninety-six people, planted more than 1,800 *mu* of grain and 500 *mu* of sugar beets, and also established pig farms, medicinal material farms, wineries, etc., which has become a small comprehensive farm.

	Young People Compete to Go Up the Mountain
	After the deeds of Hou Tingren and the others in building a "grain abundant and wealth inexhaustible" gold and silver mountain in the high mountains spread, many young men and women responded to the county party committee's call to build the mountainous areas and marched towards the barren mountains.
	Guo Xiuhua, who is not yet seventeen years old this year, came to the farm in this way. After listening to the teacher's story about Hou Tingren's diligent and frugal construction of the mountainous areas at school, she expressed her determination to go to the mountains to her mother. Her mother was unwilling, thinking she was too young. The next day, before the roosters crowed for the second time, she left in the dark. This stubborn little girl thought, "Everyone is learning from Director Hou, how can we differentiate between adults and children?" When she came to the farm, she gathered three people and opened up five *fen* of land next to the rocky beach to conduct experiments on planting *Scrophularia ningpoensis* using spare time. Initially, the farm planted *Scrophularia ningpoensis* by the old method, with a plant spacing of one and a half *chi*, and could not plant much on one *mu* of land. Later, Hou Tingren and Wang Changzhen jointly tried to change to close planting, and then to row planting, and the yield per *mu* increased from more than one hundred *jin* to seven hundred *jin*. However, Guo Xiuhua felt that single-row planting was still sparse, and came up with the idea of changing to double-row planting. At that time, some young workers ridiculed her: "So dense, how will it ventilate when it grows? Guo Xiuhua, if you can harvest big *Scrophularia ningpoensis* this way, I will drink all the water in this ditch!" She was so angry that she flung her pigtails back and retorted: "If you really harvest big *Scrophularia ningpoensis*, would you have such a big belly?" When Old Hou heard about this, he went to her field to take a look and said, "Girl, you are ambitious, and a newborn calf is not afraid of tigers. That's how it should be." Not only did she engage in spare-time experimental land to plant medicinal materials, but when she saw wild medicinal materials and wild fibers during labor in the production team, she brought them back, and when she saw a few wild *Pinellia ternata* under the hoe, she put them in her pocket. After the autumn harvest, when it was time to sell the medicinal materials, the medicinal material purchasers were increasingly surprised and couldn't help but tell Old Hou, "This girl of yours is really good. She harvested more than seven hundred *jin* of dry *Scrophularia ningpoensis* and more than two thousand *jin* of *Scrophularia ningpoensis* buds from five *fen* of land, selling them for eight hundred yuan." The team's storekeeper also came to report: "Guo Xiuhua sold more than two hundred yuan for the wild medicinal materials she picked up from the ground." Since then, Guo Xiuhua has become the famous "Thousand Yuan Girl".
	Among the heroic sons and daughters who built the high mountains here, there are also the "Five Heroine Girls" (a combat group composed of five girls) who built ten *li* of *Coptis chinensis* sheds at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters, and the Hongxia Assault Team that persisted on the old camp... They work during the day and study at night in these high mountains. During rest, they casually pick up two bamboo hats and dance the Clam Dance, and put a quilt on top of their heads and play the Lion Lantern, which is very lively.
	It is they who have opened up a broad road for advancing to the high mountains. Now, Zhuxi County has begun to advance to the high mountains, and the population of the five communes in the mountains has quickly increased by a quarter. (Attached picture)

    深山老林创家业
    ——记全国农业劳动模范侯廷仁建设山区的模范事迹
    本报记者　曹葆铭　田庄　李金锴
    近两年来，国营湖北竹溪综合农场的场长侯廷仁总是经常被一些来自平川的青年男女相跟着，他们坚决要求参加到这个山区农场里来劳动。老侯说：“高山、平川都是建设?。”他们说：“高山建设更需要人。”老侯说：“高山里很苦。”他们说：“你这大年纪都不怕，我们青年人更不要紧。”总之，不达到目的不肯罢休。
    的确，怎么能叫这些富有理想的青年不往高山上跑呢？老侯他自己就是一个见深山老林便直往里钻的人。几年间，这个农场便由低山地区的三合坝发展到二高山的漆树坪，进一步发展到海拔二千二百米的大高山绝龙岭、云雾溪，在南北三百六十里，东西一百三十里的地区里开发了二百多座山。他们就在这头上是太阳、脚下是白云的高高山上，种粮食，放牛羊，兴药材，办工厂，没有领国家一文钱，而现在却为国家积累了两百多万元的财富。最近，他们又在羊家扒——这座属于大巴山系的老山林里，利用山间激流作动力，建起了水电站、机械厂、黄连素厂等十三个小工厂和七十多间工人宿舍。眼看这个原来只有两户三人的老树扒，就要成为一个工业小镇了。
    有群众就有办法
    这个农场在三合坝创办的时候，只有老侯一个人和两间破房、五十四亩白沙地，耕牛农具通通没有。老侯来到这里，思谋了好几天也不知怎办才好。县长段景修找他商议如何办农场，老侯寻思了一阵说：“先拨点经费置买耕牛农具吧！”县长笑了笑说：“农民一人种几亩地都能养活一大家人，你现在有五十四亩地，还要经费？老侯呀，咱们国家给反动派搞穷了。咱们没钱要办有钱的事！”接着，县长又问他：“你经过土改没有？”“经过呀。”“那好，土改是怎搞的？我们共产党啥事都要依靠群众，发动群众。”这下可拨亮了老侯的心。
    侯廷仁回到三合坝，就决定想办法发动群众。一天，他见七十多岁的贫农涂学明领着小儿子在田里打谷。那个青年不会打，把谷子撒的到处都是，他走上前去，说：“这样打，不行啊！”说着，他就动手帮助干。他接过谷把来，扬的开，拌的重，一粒谷子都不撒在桶外，草把也扎得整齐利索，喜得涂老汉教育他儿子说：“娃子，看人家是怎打的？要好好学。十年能熬个举人，熬不到个庄稼手。”老侯帮涂老汉打了一天谷子，老汉又叫他一起吃饭，详细询问他的情况。他将县委的指示一讲，老汉说：“是党派你来办农场的？那好，儿子我有三个，牛也是现成的，你有啥困难尽管讲，有我们贫雇农相帮。”老侯就这样开始同群众建立了亲密的换工关系。他起早贪黑，白天帮人家干活，夜晚借农具给农场耕地。临到农场要种麦时，几家贫农连人带牛都来了，乡里二十四个党、团员也每人挑了担肥料来，帮老侯把麦子妥妥实实地种下了。
    社会主义是人建设的
    一年后，农场用自己的收入还清了债，添置了耕牛农具。还吸收了六个工人。老侯深深体会到：“社会主义是人建设的，不是钱买的”。我们要勤俭建国，必须听党的话，坚决依靠群众，艰苦奋斗。
    农场在山脚扎下了根，就进一步向山上发展。老侯领着四个工人上到山腰罗家坡。这里阳光、水源充足，还有密密的一片好水草，能耕能牧，但就是野猪多。他们头天上山，一群野猪就趁他们出外砍柴的机会钻进茅棚里来，将锅灶拱翻。他们就坚持在这里种粮食，牧牛羊，把这里建成了向大高山进军的根据地。
    根据县委指示，农场按山区的特点，要种粮食，还要发展多种经营，大搞药材生产。老侯打听到邻近四川边界的大高山云雾溪里有很多野生黄连秧，便马上同尹绪刚、萧德才五个工人进入这座横直一二百里的深山老林去采集。老侯他们先在丰溪镇用三十斤面粉做成两斤一个的大馍带上，攀过脚边就是百丈深渊的阎王边、鬼门关，才进入这座森林。里面，密密生长着高大的松、杉和桦树，还有栗子、核桃、水梨、洋桃各种果木和杜仲、当归各色各样的药材。山林里，清清的泉水哗哗流，黑黑的油土几尺厚。但是，这好的地方却没人开发，任凭树叶、野果结了落，落了结，在地面铺上尺多厚。他们在这深山密林里，白天四出找黄连秧，夜里升起一堆篝火，几人背靠背睡觉。他们一连找了五天，就是找不到黄连秧。临到干粮吃尽那天，他们才发现密密的林荫间里长着香菜般的黄连秧，一片接连一片，多极了。他们一气扯了十一万棵秧子，就勒紧裤带，挑着往山外走。
    他们就用这批野秧兴起第一棚黄连，以后就发展到几十棚、几百棚。他们还将几十种野生药材培植成了家生药材。生产越发展，老侯越认为那些人迹罕到的深山老林是金山银窝，财宝无穷。在农场准备大发展时，他就冒着风雪到深山里去勘察了一个多月。凡是没人开发的大山，他都想开发；凡是没人经营的老林，他都想经营。他一次便看中了几十座山林。
    化整为零就地发展
    但是，怎么向这许多地方发展呢？老侯盘算了一下，他们经营了五年，总共才有四个队四十二人和十万元财资，怎么也支配不开。县委书记阎怀智给他出了个主意：“农场当初只有你一个人。你们这次就实行‘三人一小队，五人一大队’的办法，把骨干都撒出去，让他们从小到大，就地发展。”老侯在党、团员会上传达了这个意见，说：“兴业犹如针挑土，败家好似浪推沙。我们虽然比过去强些，但也要事事注意勤俭，省钱又省人。”党员尹绪刚——一个从小被反动派逼到山里砍柴为生的工人，当时就报名到方家坪。临行前，他去商店买了担新粪桶，边走边想：“侯场长办农场只带来一把雨伞，我也只花三块钱买这担桶。”谁知正碰上老侯，老侯笑着说了句：“场里有的是旧桶，找出来修补修补就顶上新的了，何必再买？”他一想，对呀，自己还不够勤俭啊，立即把新桶退回去了。他同三个队员踏着积雪到达方家坪时，天已黑了。这个长期没人来的老林，连个破茅棚也没有，他们便躺在一个突出的岩石下面过了一夜。第二天大早起身仔细观看，这里不仅水好土肥，而且坡势平缓，正好种植药材。他们马上分头砍树架茅棚，开垦荒地，先后种上了四十亩玄参、八十亩甜菜。他们四个人，头一年就有了七千多元的收入。
    尹绪刚他们做出了勤俭建队的榜样，全场立时掀起了“学老尹，赶老尹”的热潮。大家都只挑一担桶和一口锅，带上几把锄头、弯刀，向山里进发。在种药材的同时，他们还分别根据山区“高一丈，不一样，阴阳坡，差的多”的复杂的自然条件，在二高山上种苞谷、燕麦，在大高山上种四季豆、洋芋，在石缝里种上爬山豆，向高山要粮又要钱。他们的农场也就由最初的一个人，发展到现在的四十二个队，九百多人。
    发展最快的是被人称做“小侯廷仁”王仲山领导的大花园生产队。王仲山今年才十九岁。四年前，他背个小包袱来农场时，老侯见他人小，只分配他去看一只羊和一头牛。在这群荒山开发者的影响和领导下，王仲山几年间就锻炼成了一个出色的牧人。大发展时，他一人赶着二十头牛，走了很多路，翻上了邻近陕西的一个大山梁，梁上一趟平，有好几万亩地。他同途中招来的跟他年纪相仿的两个青年一起，就在这名叫大花园的山梁上办起农牧场。现在，他这个队已经发展到九十六人，种了一千八百多亩粮食和五百亩甜菜，还办起了养猪场、药材场、酿酒厂等等，已经成了一个小型的综合农场。
    青年们争先上山
    当侯廷仁他们在大高山建成“粮食丰足有余，财富开发不尽”的金银山的事迹传开之后，许许多多的青年男女都响应县委建设山区的号召，向荒山进军。
    今年还没有满十七岁的郭秀华，就是这样来到农场的。她在学校听了老师讲侯廷仁勤俭建设山区的故事，便向她妈妈提出了进山的决心。她妈妈不愿意，认为她太小。第二天鸡才叫二遍，她就摸黑走了。这个倔强的小姑娘心想：“学侯场长，大家都学嘛，怎么能分人大人小？”她来到农场，就约了三个人在乱石滩旁开出五分地来，利用工余时间进行种植玄参的试验。最初，场里按老办法点种玄参，株距一尺五，一亩地就种不上多少一点。后来，侯廷仁又和王昌珍一起设法改为点种密植，再改为条播，每亩地的产量就由一百多斤提高到七百来斤。但郭秀华嫌单行条播还稀，又想法改为双行条播。当时便有一些青年工人嘲笑她：“这么密，长起来怎通风？郭秀华，你这样要能收到大玄参，我就把这条沟里的水全喝了！”她气得小辫子往后一甩，顶了一句：“真要收了大玄参，你能有这大的肚子？”老侯听说这事，特地上她地里看了看，说：“女娃子，有志气，初生的牛犊不怕虎。就是要这样。”她不仅搞业余试验地种药材，在生产队劳动时，她见了野生药材、野生纤维就往回带，见了锄头底下有几粒野生半夏也往兜里揣。秋收之后，要出售药材了，药材采购人员越收越惊异，忍不住向老侯讲：“你们这个女娃真行，五分地就收了七百多斤干玄参和两千多斤玄参芽子，卖了我们八百元。”队上的保管员也来汇报：“郭秀华光从地里拾回的野生药材就卖了两百多元。”从此，郭秀华就成了著名的“千元姑娘”。
    在这里建设高山的英雄儿女当中，还有在海拔二千多米兴建十里黄连棚的“五英姑娘”（由五个姑娘组成的战斗组），有坚持在老营盘上的红霞突击队，……他们在这高高山上，白天劳动，晚上学习。休息的时候他们顺手拾两个斗笠就跳起了蚌蛤舞，顶上一床被窝便玩开了狮子灯，热闹得很。
    就是他们，为向高山进军开辟出了广阔的道路。现在，竹溪全县都开始进军高山了，山里五个公社很快便增加了四分之一的人口。（附图片）
