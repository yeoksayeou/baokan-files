    Give Full Play to the Role of Auxiliary Labor

    Tao Miao Commune Party Committee Correspondence Group, Jieshou County Party Committee, CCP

    Editor's Note: It is of great significance to fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of auxiliary labor. The investigation of the Qian Jiangyou Production Team proves that the number of auxiliary laborers is very large, especially since many of them have rich agricultural production technologies and experience; applying these technologies and experience has a positive effect on accelerating the development of agricultural production.

    The reason why the Qian Jiangyou Production Team can fully mobilize the role of auxiliary labor lies in their in-depth investigation and research, grasping the specific situation of each auxiliary laborer, and arranging appropriate farm work according to individual conditions; caring for them politically and in their lives, and educating them, are also very important tasks.

    The Qian Jiangyou Production Team of Tao Miao Commune, Jieshou County, Anhui Province, is very good at giving play to the role of auxiliary labor.

    Great Potential

    The Party branch of this production team divides full, semi, and auxiliary labor based on age, physical strength, attendance rate, and technical conditions. The whole team has 116 households and 520 people, with 117 full laborers, 47 semi-laborers, and 157 auxiliary laborers. Among these auxiliary laborers, there are 67 elderly people, 7 young and middle-aged people with physical defects, and 83 students around the age of 14. The Party branch flexibly arranges work based on the technical expertise and physical strength of each auxiliary laborer, as well as the constantly changing farm work. They divide auxiliary labor into three types:

    (1) Elderly commune members. There are 67 of them in the whole team. These auxiliary laborers have four situations: First, those who can only use their mouths but not their hands, the "farming experts." They have accumulated decades of rich experience in planting various crops. Because they are too old to participate in field production, the Party branch invites them to be technical advisors to the production team. Second, those who are physically strong and can still do some field work, especially those with various practical experiences. The Party branch assigns them to various specialized teams to participate in production and provide technical guidance. Third, those who do not have special technical skills in field production are assigned to do general odd jobs such as accumulating fertilizer, weeding, and pest control, depending on their physical strength. Fourth, there are 31 elderly women, 13 of whom have expertise in field management of certain crops, such as seed selection, sweet potato seedling cutting, and cotton pruning and topping; 18 elderly women lack agricultural production technology, and the production team arranges them in collective welfare departments such as nurseries, sewing groups, and laundry groups.

    (2) There are a total of 7 people in the whole team who have physical defects or chronic diseases. According to the specific situation of each person, they are assigned light work such as keeping farm tools and grain, making shoes, and helping the cafeteria pick vegetables.

    (3) There are 83 students around the age of 14 in the whole team. They are organized to pick up crops and pull weeds on Sundays and during busy farming holidays.

    These auxiliary laborers have a great effect when organized. Taking current field management as an example, in August alone, they pulled 150,000 catties of weeds, dried and stored more than 6,000 catties of green fodder, and accumulated 2,500 dan of fertilizer, which has all been transported to the late sweet potato fields; 7 elderly women made 173 pieces of clothing and 30 pairs of shoes for the team members, saving 210 labor days for young and middle-aged women, effectively strengthening field management work.

    Give Play to Technical Expertise

    Among the 157 auxiliary laborers in the whole team, a total of 39 have technical expertise. The Party branch makes full use of the technical expertise of each auxiliary laborer according to local conditions. Six people with various crop planting experiences are arranged to be technical advisors to the production team; 33 people with experience in planting single crops are assigned to various crop specialized teams to provide technical guidance. The production team and the specialized teams invite them to participate in meetings to study work or arrange farm work, so that key problems in production at various times can be solved. This year, the team planted 62 mu of spring sweet potatoes and planned to plant 450 mu of wheat stubble sweet potatoes. Each mu of spring sweet potatoes has to bear 7.2 mu of wheat stubble sweet potatoes. The contradiction between ensuring timely planting of wheat stubble sweet potatoes and the small area of spring sweet potatoes was very prominent at the time. Seeing this situation, the old farmer Li Ziyun offered the production team leader Cheng Delin a trick: "Water frequently and apply more fertilizer, and the sweet potato seedlings can grow six or seven inches in one day and one night." The production team accepted this suggestion and selected 14 people with sweet potato management skills from the team's auxiliary laborers to form a specialized team. After the spring sweet potatoes were firmly rooted, they quickly applied a dose of human urine fertilizer to each plant and watered them thoroughly. In conjunction with the second watering, 15 catties of ammonium sulfate were applied per mu. When planting wheat stubble sweet potatoes, in addition to ensuring the use of seedlings for 450 mu of wheat stubble sweet potatoes in the team, 1,200 catties were also supported to other teams. Recently, in order to expand the autumn planting area and prepare for the autumn planting in advance, the Party branch held two technical advisory meetings for old farmers to conduct specific research on this year's autumn planting. Due to the rational arrangement of labor and livestock power, it is possible to harvest well without affecting planting well, and the large area of late autumn crops does not affect the planting of more wheat. This year, the team's late-stubble wheat increased by 20% compared with last year. How to make the growth of late-stubble wheat catch up with early-stubble wheat before winter? During the discussion, the old farmer Wang Maogong introduced his past experience in obtaining a bumper harvest of late-stubble wheat. The Party branch carefully studied his experience and concentrated its efforts to accumulate more than 18,000 dan of fertilizer and apply it to the wheat stubble sweet potato fields.

    Fixing auxiliary laborers with technical expertise to specialized teams can help solve technical problems in a timely manner. For example, the 1.7 mu of Chinese cabbage planted by the Xitou production group last year generally rotted at the roots. Cheng Jinyu, who had been planting vegetables for more than 30 years, found out the reason for the rotting of the Chinese cabbage: the land was plowed shallowly, the soil was not broken up, and the roots of the cabbage could not take root; in response to these reasons, he also proposed that the vegetable base was too scattered, which was not easy to manage and wasted labor. According to his opinion, the Party branch concentrated the originally scattered vegetable fields into one piece and determined Cheng Jinyu as the technical guidance for the vegetable specialized team.

    In the past few years, these auxiliary laborers with technical expertise have also cultivated 36 technical talents for the production team in breeding, land preparation, sowing, planting melons and vegetables, and field management.

    Strengthen Education and Care for Life

    In order to give full play to the role of auxiliary labor, the Party branch of the Qian Jiangyou Production Team pays great attention to ideological education. They analyzed the five ideological situations of old farmers and adopted a "prescriptive" approach. The first type is old people with red hearts, who love the community like their own home and are wholeheartedly for the collective, and are advanced figures among the elderly commune members. The Party branch educates all team members through their exemplary deeds. The second type is old age, less participation in meetings, and insufficient concern for collective production. On the one hand, the Party branch often tells them the truth of "when the big river has water, the small river is full, and when the big river has no water, the small river is dry" through party members, citing the fact that auxiliary laborers in the team participate in production, offer suggestions, and increase grain production, and carry out collectivist ideological education of loving the community and loving the team; on the other hand, they are invited to participate in production meetings in the team and old farmers' heart-to-heart talks are often held to listen to their opinions and requirements. The third type is those who are old-fashioned, disagree with others, and do more when they are happy and less when they are not happy. For this kind of people, usually care for them more politically, strengthen education, cadres talk to them more often, and establish their prestige in production. The fourth type is those who have a strong desire to win and can only be praised but not criticized. On the one hand, their achievements are praised, and on the other hand, ideological education is carried out that "more people have more ideas, one person's strength is limited, and the wisdom of the masses is infinite." The fifth type is those who are ideologically conservative, unwilling to learn from advanced experiences in other places, and unwilling to impart their own experience to the outside world. The Party branch invites them to participate in the experimental fields for training cadres and technicians, and uses the actual achievements of the "experimental fields" for live education; at the same time, their technical expertise is used more in production, and young and middle-aged people are educated to respect them and learn from their production experience with humility.

    The ideological work of the Party branch has greatly improved the enthusiasm of auxiliary labor. Among the 39 auxiliary laborers with technical expertise in the whole team, 14 were rated as models.

    The production team's Party branch also gives the greatest care to the auxiliary laborers' clothing, food, housing, and other living problems.

    充分发挥辅助劳力的作用
    中共界首县委  陶庙公社党委通讯组
    编者按：把辅助劳力的生产积极性充分调动起来，是一项具有重大意义的事。前姜柚生产队的调查证明：辅助劳力的数量很大，特别是他们之中有许多人具有丰富的农业生产技术和经验；把这些技术和经验运用起来，对加速农业生产的发展有积极作用。
    前姜柚生产队能充分调动起辅助劳力的作用，就在于他们进行了深入的调查研究工作，掌握了每个辅助劳力的具体情况，因人制宜安排恰当的农活；从政治上、生活上关心他们，教育他们，也是十分重要的工作。
    安徽界首县陶庙公社前姜柚生产队，很善于发挥辅助劳力的作用。
    潜力很大
    这个生产队党支部，对整、半劳动力和辅助劳动力的划分，是根据年龄、体力、出勤率以及技术条件等确定的。全队一百一十六户，五百二十人，整劳动力一百一十七人，半劳动力四十七人，辅助劳动力有一百五十七人。这些辅助劳动力中，有老年六十七人，有生理缺陷的青壮年七人，十四岁左右的学生八十三人。党支部根据各个辅助劳动力的技术专长和体力，以及农活随时变化的情况灵活安排工作。他们把辅助劳力分为三种类型：
    （一）是年龄大的老社员，全队共有六十七人，这些辅助劳力，有四种情况：一种是能出嘴不能动手的“庄稼通”。他们都积累了几十年的种植各种作物的丰富经验，因为年龄过大，不能参加田间生产，党支部请他们当生产队的技术顾问。第二种是身体健壮，还能做些田间农活，特别是有各种实际经验，党支部把他们分到各种专业队，一面参加生产，一面作技术指导。第三种是对田间生产没有技术特长的，根据他们体力情况，分配做些积肥、除草、扑虫等一般杂活。第四种是三十一个老年妇女，其中有十三个对某种作物田间管理有特长，如选种、剪甘薯秧、棉花整枝打杈等；有十八个老年妇女缺乏农业生产技术，生产队把她们安排在托儿所、缝衣组、洗衣组等集体福利事业部门。
    （二）全队因生理缺陷或有慢性病的共七人，根据各人具体情况，分配他们保管农具、粮食、做鞋和帮助食堂摘菜等轻活。
    （三）全队有十四岁左右的学生八十三人，利用星期天、农忙假，组织他们拾庄稼、拔草。
    这些辅助劳力组织起来作用很大。以当前田间管理为例，仅8月份，他们拔草十五万斤，晒贮青饲料六千多斤，积肥二千五百担，并已全部运到晚甘薯地里；七个老年妇女为全队社员做衣裳一百七十三件，做鞋三十双，节省了青壮年妇女二百一十个劳动日，有效地加强了田间管理工作。
    发挥技术专长
    全队一百五十七个辅助劳力中，有技术专长的共三十九人，党支部因人制宜的充分发挥每个辅助劳力的技术专长。把有各种农作物种植经验的六人，安排在生产队作技术顾问；有种植单项作物经验的三十三人分到各种作物专业队，作技术指导。生产队和专业队在开会研究工作或安排农活时，都邀请他们参加，这样可以解决各个时期生产中的关键性问题。今年这个队种植春甘薯六十二亩，计划种麦茬甘薯四百五十亩，每亩春甘薯要负担七亩二分麦茬甘薯用秧。保证麦茬甘薯适时下种与春甘薯面积小的矛盾，在当时非常突出。老农李子运看到这种情况，向生产队长程德林献了一条计策：“勤浇水多上粪，甘薯秧子一天一夜能长六七寸。”生产队接受了这个意见，从全队辅助劳力中，挑选对管理甘薯有技术的十四人，组成专业队。他们在春甘薯活稳棵后，迅速逐棵追施一次人尿肥，并放大水浇了一遍。结合第二次浇水，每亩又追施硫酸铵十五斤，到栽麦茬甘薯时，一次剪秧除保证本队四百五十亩麦茬甘薯用秧外，还支援外队一千二百斤。最近党支部为了扩大秋种面积，提前做好各项秋种准备工作，生产队开过两次老农技术顾问会议，对今年秋种作了具体研究。由于合理安排了劳畜力，做到收好不影响种好，也不因为晚秋作物面积大而影响多种麦。今年，这个队晚茬麦比去年增加20％。如何使晚茬麦的生长在冬前就赶上早茬麦呢？在讨论的时候，老农王茂公介绍了自己过去种晚茬麦获得丰收的经验。党支部认真研究了他的经验，集中力量突击积肥一万八千多担，追施到麦茬甘薯地里。
    把有技术专长的辅助劳力，固定到专业队，可以及时帮助解决技术问题。例如西头生产组去年种的一亩七分大白菜，根部普遍坏烂，种了三十多年菜的程金玉，找出了大白菜坏烂原因：地犁的浅，土整的不碎，白菜根扎不下去；针对这些原因，他还提出蔬菜基地太分散，不易管理，浪费劳力等意见。党支部根据他的意见，将原来分散的菜地，集中为一块，并确定程金玉为蔬菜专业队的技术指导。
    这些有技术专长的辅助劳力，几年来还为生产队培养了饲养、整地、撒种、种植瓜菜、田间管理等技术人材三十六人。
    加强教育　关心生活
    前姜柚生产队党支部为了充分发挥辅助劳力的作用，十分注意思想教育工作。他们分析了老农有五种思想情况，采取了“对症下药”的办法。第一种，人老心红，爱社如家，一心为集体，是老年社员中的先进人物。党支部通过他们的模范事迹，教育全队社员。第二种，年纪大，参加会议少，对集体生产不够关心。党支部一方面通过党员经常给他们讲“大河有水小河满，大河无水小河干”的道理，举出本队辅助劳力参加生产，出谋献计，使粮食增加产量的事实，对他们进行爱社、爱队的集体主义思想教育；一方面队里开生产会议时，都邀请他们参加，并经常召开老农谈心会，听取他们的意见和要求。第三种，性情古板，认理别扭，高兴多干，不高兴不干。对这种人，平时从政治上多关心他们，加强教育，干部多和他们谈心，在生产中多树立他的威信。第四种，好胜心强，能表扬不能批评。对这些人一方面表扬他们的成绩，一方面还要进行“人多办法多，一人力量有限，群众智慧无穷”的思想教育。第五种，思想保守，不愿学习外地先进经验，自己的经验又不愿向外传授。党支部就请他们参加干部、技术员培养的试验田，以“试验田”的实际成绩进行活的教育；同时在生产中多发挥他们的技术专长，教育青壮年要尊重他们，虚心向他们学习生产经验。
    党支部的思想工作使辅助劳力的积极性大大提高。全队三十九个有技术专长的辅助劳力中，被评为模范的有十四人。
    生产队党支部对辅助劳力的衣、食、住、用等生活问题，也予以最大的关心。
