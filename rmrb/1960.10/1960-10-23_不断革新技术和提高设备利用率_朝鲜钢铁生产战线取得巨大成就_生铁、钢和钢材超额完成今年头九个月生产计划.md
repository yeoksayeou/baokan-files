Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 22nd: Thanks to the continuous innovation of technology and the improvement of equipment utilization, Korean steel workers have successively achieved great successes on the steel front. According to the person in charge of the Steel Industry Administration of the Korean Heavy Industry Commission, the steel industry sector in Korea overfulfilled the production plans for pig iron, steel, and steel products for the first nine months of this year. Compared with the same period last year, the output of these three products increased by 25.8%, 42%, and 49% respectively.

In addition, during this period, Korean steel plants also increased the variety of their products. The Seongjin Steel Plant, which mainly produces special steel, added more than 40 types of steel during this period, which is of great significance to the development of the Korean machinery industry.

These production increase achievements of the workers in various steel plants were achieved by innovating technology and improving equipment utilization rates, basically without increasing labor or equipment. The iron-smelting workers of the Kim Chaek Iron Works and the Hwanghae Iron Works increased the hot blast temperature of the blast furnace by an average of 100 degrees. The workers of the various iron mines also actively increased the grade of iron ore, supplying the iron-smelting plants with better concentrate, thereby increasing the production of pig iron.

In addition, the workers in the steel-making workshop of the Hwanghae Iron Works recently widely adopted the method of directly injecting molten iron into the furnace for steelmaking, which shortened the time for smelting a furnace of steel by one hour compared to the past. The workers of the Gangseon Steel Plant recently adopted advanced technology to extend the life of the furnace roof by one and a half to two times compared to the past. They also adopted oxygen-enriched blasting, which shortened the steelmaking time, so that the plant's steel output in the first nine months of this year increased by 45% compared to the same period last year.

The employees of the rolling mill departments of various steel plants have also innovated technology and improved the output of steel products. The workers in the medium-sized bar steel workshop of the Hwanghae Iron Works recently improved the rolls of the 750 cm rolling mill. In the past, it took thirteen passes to roll a steel billet into steel, but now it only takes eleven passes, which increased steel production by 60% to 70%. The workers of the Seongjin Steel Plant also simplified the process of rolling special steel, greatly increasing the output of special steel. (Attached picture)

During the war of aggression launched by American imperialism, the steel plants in northern Korea were severely damaged. But in just a few years, the indomitable Korean workers rebuilt steel industry bases on the ruins, restoring, expanding, and newly building many blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, converter workshops, and rolling mill workshops. The picture shows a large number of steel ingots produced by the Gangseon Steel Plant, which was severely damaged in Korea. Korean Central News Agency manuscript (Xinhua News Agency)

    不断革新技术和提高设备利用率
    朝鲜钢铁生产战线取得巨大成就
    生铁、钢和钢材超额完成今年头九个月生产计划
    新华社平壤22日电　朝鲜的钢铁工人由于不断革新技术，提高设备利用率，在钢铁战线上接连获得了巨大的成就。据朝鲜重工业委员会钢铁工业管理局负责人对本社记者说：朝鲜的钢铁工业部门超额完成了今年头九个月的生铁、钢和钢材的生产计划，同去年同期相比，这三种产品的产量分别增长了25.8％、42％、49％。
    此外，这一期间朝鲜各钢铁厂也增加了产品的品种，以生产特殊钢为主的城津炼钢厂这一期间就增加了四十多种钢的品种，这对朝鲜机械工业的发展有很大的意义。
    各钢铁厂的工人们的这些增产成就，是在基本上不增加劳动力和设备的情况下，通过革新技术、提高设备利用率的方法取得的。金策制铁所和黄海制铁所的炼铁工人把高炉的热风温度平均提高了一百度，各个铁矿的工人们也积极提高铁矿砂的品位，给炼铁厂供应了更好的精矿，使生铁得到增产。
    另外，黄海制铁所的炼钢车间的工人们最近广泛采用了直接把铁水注入炉中炼钢的方法，使炼一炉钢的时间比过去缩短了一小时。降仙炼钢厂的工人们最近采用先进技术使炉顶的寿命比过去延长一倍半到两倍，还采用了富氧鼓风法，缩短了炼钢时间，使这个厂今年头九个月的钢产量比去年同期增长了45％。
    各钢铁厂的轧钢部门的职工们也革新了技术、提高了钢材的产量。黄海制铁所的中型条钢车间的工人们最近把七百五十厘米的轧钢机的轧辊加以改进，过去把钢坯轧成钢材要轧十三次，现在只要十一次，使钢材产量提高了60％到70％。城津炼钢厂的工人们也简化了轧制特殊钢材的工序，大量增加了特殊钢材的产量。（附图片）
    在美帝国主义发动侵略战争期间，朝鲜北部各钢铁厂遭到了严重破坏。但是在短短的几年里，不屈的朝鲜工人，又在废墟上重建起了一座座的钢铁工业基地，恢复、扩建和新建了许多高炉、平炉、转炉车间及轧钢车间等。图为朝鲜遭受到巨大破坏的降仙炼钢厂生产的大批钢锭。　朝鲜中央通讯社稿（新华社发）
