    Tianjin Industrial Management Departments Promote "One-Three-Two System" Leadership Method
    Cadres Deeply Involved in the Production Front Line as a System
    Leadership Work Becomes More Accurate and Thorough, Timely Exchange of Experiences, Effectively Solve Problems, and Promote Continuous Progress in Production
    (Our newspaper Tianjin, October 23rd dispatch) The administrative leading organs of the Tianjin industrial departments have earnestly implemented the decision of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to promote the "One-Three-Two System" in all organs throughout the city. They have universally promoted the "One-Three-Two System" leadership method, making it a system for cadres to go deep into the production front line to participate in and lead production. The leadership style has become more in-depth and pragmatic, powerfully promoting the sustained leap forward in industrial production.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, leading cadres at all levels in Tianjin's industrial departments have adopted methods such as "following shifts," "generals becoming soldiers," and "cultivating experimental plots" to participate in and lead production, achieving certain results in strengthening leadership in basic-level work and promoting production development. However, this approach was not systematized, and sometimes, due to the large number of affairs at the higher levels, it could not be consistently implemented. Especially since the beginning of this year, with the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement on the industrial front, and the constant emergence of new things, many new experiences created by factories need to be summarized and promoted by the leading departments in a timely manner, and work tasks are becoming increasingly heavy. Under this new situation, there is an urgent need to establish a set of scientific leadership methods and working methods to further improve the working ability of leading cadres. In view of this situation, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the spirit of the "Two-Five System" and combined with the characteristics of urban and industrial production, formulated the "One-Three-Two System" leadership method. That is, within a week, one day for study, three days for handling daily work, and two days for going deep into the grassroots, focusing on production, grasping key points and key issues, and promoting the development of production.
    The implementation of the "One-Three-Two System" leadership method in Tianjin is a major improvement in leadership methods and leadership style, and also a major progress in the thinking of cadres. At the beginning of implementation, some cadres believed that "there are few people and the work is busy, going down will affect the work of the department" and were unwilling to go down. In response to this situation, leading organs such as industrial bureaus and professional companies organized cadres to study relevant documents, conducted education on the Party's mass line, and made specific arrangements for work, going down to factories, and learning; they formulated specific measures to improve the quality of meetings, strictly control meetings, and reduce documents and reports to ensure that cadres have enough time to go deep into the production front line. At the same time, a system of assigning cadres to specific areas was implemented. After the cadres of various departments went deep into the workshops and teams, they adopted the methods of "grabbing everything when going down, and dividing the work again when returning" and "four sides, three grasps, and one package to the end" (that is: participate in production, discover problems, solve problems, and direct production; grasp production, life, and thinking, truly achieving "one package to the end"). In order to timely concentrate the problems discovered by cadres when they went to factories, analyze and study them, and solve them, the various departments correspondingly established coordination meetings. In this way, the problem of closely combining departmental work and central work was solved. After taking these measures, the industrial bureaus and professional companies throughout the city universally implemented the "One-Three-Two System" leadership method. At present, more than 85% of leading cadres such as bureau chiefs and managers throughout the city earnestly adhere to the "One-Three-Two System" leadership method. In going deep into the production front line, they adopt a working method that combines "turning" and "squatting." "Turning" means that leading cadres such as bureau chiefs and managers lead relevant cadres to factories at the prescribed time, thereby discovering and solving ideological and specific problems. "Squatting" means that after discovering some major and directional problems in the middle of "turning," they adopt the method of cultivating "experimental plots" to go deep down, spend a longer time, summarize advanced experiences, and then promote them comprehensively, effectively promoting the development of production. The general cadres of the functional departments of the various organs also adopt the method of corresponding up and down, and go deep into advanced factories or backward factories with a purpose, to summarize experience or discover and solve problems. For example, the cadres of the finance departments (sections) of the various bureaus and companies go deep into backward factories to help with the work of small group economic accounting; the cadres of the planning departments (sections) focus on understanding the implementation of plans and problems in participating in labor.
    Since the industrial administrative leading organs of Tianjin City comprehensively implemented the "One-Three-Two System" leadership method in June of this year, they have achieved remarkable results in more than four months. In addition to cadres going deep into reality and adhering to theoretical study, thereby enriching production knowledge and leadership experience, and training and improving the work ability of cadres, the most prominent manifestation is the strengthening of leadership on the production front line, promoting the development of production. Leading cadres at all levels go deep into the production front line, work and discuss with the masses, and pragmatically help basic-level cadres solve specific problems in production, thus a new atmosphere of "three more, three less, and one fast" has emerged in work, that is, there are more leading cadres going deep into the front line, and less squatting in the office; there is more on-site investigation and research, and fewer reports and meetings in the organs; there are more problems solved, and less pointing fingers; and advanced experience is spread faster. In carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement with grain and steel as the center, the leading cadres of the city, district, and bureau-related units went deep into the various steel plants to grasp the current production on the one hand, and prepare for the next step on the other hand; they grasped both big problems and small problems; at the same time, with the converter as the center and the iron smelting furnace as the focus, they grasped the connection and collaboration, promoting the continuous rise in steel production. Since August, a new situation of leap forward increase and a higher level in each ten-day period has emerged in steel production. The steel production in August increased by 18.3% compared with July, and in September it surged by another 28.68% compared with August, setting a new historical record for steel production in the city. At the same time, the qualified rate of steel ingots in September also increased from 94.55% in July to 98%. (Attached picture)

### 天津工业管理部门推行“一三二制”领导方法  干部深入生产第一线形成制度  领导工作愈抓愈准愈抓愈透，及时交流经验，切实解决问题，推动生产不断前进

    天津工业管理部门推行“一三二制”领导方法
    干部深入生产第一线形成制度
    领导工作愈抓愈准愈抓愈透，及时交流经验，切实解决问题，推动生产不断前进
    本报天津23日电　天津市工业部门行政领导机关，认真贯彻中共天津市委在全市所有机关推行“一三二”制的决定，普遍推行了“一三二制”领导方法，使干部深入生产第一线参加生产领导生产形成制度，领导作风更加深入踏实，有力地促进了工业生产的持续跃进。
    大跃进以来，天津市工业部门的各级领导干部，分别采取“跟班劳动”、“将军当兵”、“种试验田”等参加生产、领导生产的方法，对加强基层工作的领导，推动生产的发展，收到一定的效果。但是，这种作法没有制度化，有时上面事务多，就不能经常贯彻执行；特别是今年以来，工业战线技术革新和技术革命运动蓬勃发展，新事物不断涌现，许多工厂创造的新经验需要领导部门及时总结、推广，工作任务日趋繁重。在这种新形势下，迫切要求建立一套科学的领导方法和工作方法，进一步提高领导干部的工作能力。针对这种情况，中共天津市委根据“二五制”的精神，结合城市和工业生产的特点，制定出“一三二制”的领导方法，就是在一周内，一天学习，三天处理日常工作，两天深入基层，以生产为中心，抓重点抓关键，推动生产的发展。
    天津推行“一三二制”领导方法，是领导方法和领导作风的重大改进，也是干部思想上的一大进步。开始实行时，有的干部认为
  “人少、业务忙，下去会影响部门工作”，不愿下去。针对这种情况，各工业局、专业公司等领导机关，分别组织干部学习有关文件，进行党的群众路线的教育，并对工作、下厂、学习作了具体安排；制定出提高会议质量，严格控制会议，减少文件表报等具体措施，保证干部有足够的时间深入生产第一线。同时，对干部实行分片包干的办法，各部门的干部深入车间、小组后，采取“下去一把抓，回来再分家”和“四边、三抓、一包到底”（就是：边参加生产、边发现问题、边解决问题、边指挥生产；抓生产、生活、思想，真正作到“一包到底”）的办法。为了及时把干部下厂发现的问题集中起来，分析研究，加以解决，各部门相应地建立了碰头会。这样，就解决了部门工作和中心工作紧密结合的问题。采取这些措施后，全市各工业局、专业公司普遍贯彻执行了“一三二制”领导方法。目前，全市85％以上的局长、经理等领导干部认真坚持实行“一三二制”领导方法，他们在深入生产第一线中，采取“转”和“蹲”相结合的工作方法。“转”就是局长、经理等领导干部率领有关干部按规定时间深入工厂，从而发现并解决思想问题和具体问题。“蹲”就是从“转”的中间发现一些重大而带有方向性的问题后，就采取种“试验田”的方法深入下去，以较长的时间，总结先进经验，然后以点带面，全面推广，有效地推动生产的发展。各机关职能科室的一般干部，也都采取上下对口的办法，有目的地深入到先进工厂或后进工厂，总结经验或发现解决问题。像各局、公司的财务处（科）的干部，深入后进工厂帮助搞小组经济核算工作；计划处（科）的干部在参加劳动中，着重了解计划执行的情况和问题。
    天津市工业行政领导机关从今年6月份全面贯彻“一三二制”领导方法以来，在四个多月中，已经取得了显著效果。除了干部深入实际和坚持了理论学习，因而丰富了生产知识和领导经验，锻炼和提高了干部的工作能力以外，最突出的表现是加强了对生产第一线的领导，促进了生产的发展。各级领导干部深入生产第一线，和群众同劳动、同商量，踏踏实实地帮助基层干部解决生产中的具体问题，因而在工作上出现了“三多、三少、一快”的新气象，即领导干部深入第一线多了，蹲在办公室少了；现场调查研究多了，机关汇报会议少了；解决问题多了，指手划脚少了；先进经验传播快了。在开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，市、区、局有关单位的领导干部，深入各钢厂一手抓当前生产，一手抓下步准备工作；他们既抓大问题，又抓小问题；同时以转炉为中心，以化铁炉为重点，抓衔接和协作，促进钢产量节节上升。8月份以来，钢产量出现逐旬跃进上升和一旬高过一旬的新局面。8月份钢产量比7月份增长18.3％，9月份比8月份又猛增28.68％，创全市钢产量的历史最高新纪录。同时，9月份钢锭合格率也由7月份的94.55％提高到98％。（附图片）
