    Cantonese Songs Accusing American Imperialism (Part 1)
    In "A Collection of Anti-American Chinese Labor Exclusion Act Literature," I selected some of the Cantonese songs popular in China at the time. Overseas Chinese works on this topic were not collected due to lack of information.
    Recently, I unexpectedly came across the "Golden Mountain Song Collection" published by Da Guang Bookstore in San Francisco in April 1911. The book contains four types of Cantonese songs, which, according to Liang Shoumin's preface, were all popular in the San Francisco area and were all works of overseas Chinese. Some of them reflect the persecution suffered by overseas Chinese under American imperialism and their feelings of grief and indignation.
    The twelve songs of "Confined in Wooden Houses, Enduring Hardships" are most representative:
    Hearing of entering the port, I packed my baggage. Who knew joy would turn to sorrow, confinement in the dark room even more leaky. How to compare, the cruel air is hard to roar. Lack of food unbearable, sternly restrained, even heroes droop their heads here.
    This is an overview. Describing "wandering tens of thousands of miles of water journey, risking my life to reach the Flower Flag" ("Thinking of Relatives as a Traveler"), it is said that when arriving in the United States, the Chinese passengers on the ship happily packed their bags, preparing to disembark. But the Americans deliberately made things difficult, confining them in "wooden houses" to await trial. The so-called "wooden houses" are "not like houses in their shortness, not as clean as prisons, crowded worse than pig pens. Autumn rain and mold, like being in water all night" ("Golden World"). Suffering from cold and hunger, not seeing the light of day.
    Immigration to America requires a certificate, foreigners extort more. I speak Southern, they speak Northern, wanting to complain but speechless. Silent, contemplating without a plan. Trapped in a cage, unable to fly, you say it's harsh, isn't it harsh.
    American regulations are harsher than tigers, people trapped on boards suffer much. Detained awaiting trial, subject to restraint, birds entering a cage, their spirit falls. Miserable, unable to complain, crying to heaven, no way out. Passing through the Golden Gate is so difficult, having tasted the experience, I regret rushing here.
    Speaking of arriving in America by boat, happy as if obtaining a treasure. How could I bear to be detained upon arrival, doctors and tax officials not approving the paper. Too much anger, hard to record with a pen. The wooden building confines people like Youli, infinite sadness in my heart.
    Why were they detained? What were they waiting for trial for? These three songs explain it clearly. First, the Americans used the excuse of checking the "certificate" to prevent Chinese passengers from landing. The "certificate" is a passport. Any missing items on the passport were used as a reason to arrest them and deny them entry. Even if every item was clearly and understandably noted, if the answer was wrong during the inquiry, they would still be labeled with the crime of "impersonation" and not allowed to disembark. Second, they used the excuse of checking the "regulations" to check whether Chinese passengers had violated their harsh and barbaric "regulations" or "cases." If the Americans considered it unsuitable, they would be sent back to China. Many people did not have return fare and had no way to borrow money, so they had to commit suicide by jumping into the sea. Third, they used the excuse of "paper" to force those who could not land. That is, the examining doctor did not provide proof that they were free from epidemics. As long as there was a little disease, such as an eye infection, the Americans would refuse to land on the grounds of "preventing infection." From "I speak Southern, they speak Northern, wanting to complain but speechless," "Too much anger, hard to record with a pen," and "having tasted the experience, I regret rushing here," one can imagine the extent of the extortion by American imperialism, its extreme cruelty, and the grief and indignation of the insulted and harmed overseas Chinese. Therefore, Zhou Xiatiao, in "Ocean Voyage," lamented, "Buried white bones in half-desolate mounds, few survive to profit from America" ("Collected Poems of Shanfang").

    Power seizes treaty rights, weak nations bear the brunt. Innocently trapped on the riverbank, the officials rampant, truly wicked. The door tightly closed, guards watching closely. No news allowed to pass, a hundred harsh conditions are difficult to bear.
    The special wooden building clearly a prison. Chinese entering the country suffer miserably, all kinds of tyranny are there. If one protests, trapped in an iron cage, even envoys find it hard to deal with, crying to heaven, frowning.
    Freedom is the country's rule, why imitate tyranny? Not relying on justice, American men, trapping me in a tightly guarded prison. Wolf and tiger guards, even more eager to devour. Punishing the innocent is truly wicked, when will I be released to open my heart.
    Here, the songs continue to reflect the suffering of overseas Chinese in "wooden houses," even "news" is "not allowed to pass." The song further points out that "power seizes treaty rights" (Japan at the time opposed the regulations restricting Japanese residents), and weak countries have no diplomacy (so it is said that "even envoys find it hard to deal with"). Chinese envoys even breathed through the same nostril as American imperialists, instead blaming overseas Chinese, especially Chinese laborers. At this time, Chinese residents and workers had already seen clearly that American imperialists were simply "wolves and tigers," "devouring" people, running rampant, not talking about justice, and tearing off their masks.

    控诉美帝国主义的粤歌（上）
    在《反美华工禁约文学集》里，我曾选录了一部分当时流行在国内的粤歌，海外华侨有关这一方面的作品，由于资料缺乏，没有搜集到。
    最近很意外的访求到1911年4月金山正埠大光书林刊的《金山歌集》。书里收有了四种粤歌，据梁寿民叙言，都是在金山一带流行的，也都是华侨的作品。其间一部分反映的，正是华侨遭受美帝国主义迫害的情况，以及他们的悲愤心情。
    《木屋拘囚吃尽苦》十二首最能代表：
    一闻入港口，打起个袱包。谁知欢喜反为愁，暗室受困更浊漏。有能较，残酷气难哮。缺食不堪严掣肘，英雄到此也垂头。
    这是总述。叙“飘泊水程数万里，精神冒险抵花旗”（《游子思亲》），就是到达美国的时候，船上中国旅客，都欢天喜地的打起包袱，准备登岸。美国佬却有意作难，把他们拘囚到“木屋”里候审。所谓“木屋”，“矮不类屋，秽不如牢，挨挤不及马棚猪棚。秋霖霉雨，终夜如在水中”（《黄金世界》）。受冻挨饿，暗不见天日。
    游美因有册，洋人多索勒。我讲南时佢讲北，欲诉冤情又语塞。口嘿嘿，思量无计策。被困牢笼飞不得，汝话苛刻唔苛刻。
    美例苛于虎，人困板壁多。所留候审受掣磨，鸟入樊笼折太堕。惨莫诉，呼天叹无路。关过金门难若此，饱尝况味悔奔波。
    一话船到美，欢同得宝珠。那堪抵埠受羁縻，医生税员未准纸。太受气，笔尖难以记。板楼困人如羑里，无限凄凉心里悲。
    为什么要被拘囚呢？候审些什么呢？这三首歌交代得很明白。第一、是美国佬借口“册”的检查，阻挠中国旅客上岸。“册”就是护照。凡护照上所列条款，只要漏注一条，就被抓作理由，不准入境。即使每一条款，都注得清楚明白，如果查诘时答对错了，照样被戴上一个“冒名顶替”的罪名，不得登岸。第二、是借口“例”的检查，检查中国旅客有无违反他们所订苛刻野蛮禁“例”或者“案”的地方，若是美国佬认为不合，就要被拨回中国。很多人没有回返船资，又无从借贷，只好投海而死。第三、是借口“纸”，来迫使不能登岸。就是检验大夫不给查清没有疫症的证明。只要有一点病，例如害了眼，美国佬就以“预防传染”为理由，拒绝登岸。从“我讲南时渠讲北，欲诉冤情又语塞”，“太受气，笔尖难以记”，以及“饱尝况味悔奔波”一些地方看，美帝国主义的敲诈勒索，极恶穷凶，和华侨被侮辱、残害，悲愤到怎样程度，可以想见。所以，周遐桃在《泛洋行》里，有“沈薶白骨半荒丘，出险几人赢美利”（《所记山房诗钞》）之叹。强权废约例，弱种受他掣。无辜困我隔江崖，关吏横行真?抵。门紧闭，狼差严密睇。音信不容驿使递，苛条百出确难捱。板楼特别起，明白系监羁。华人入境受凄其，种种专制由在彼。有争气，困埋铁笼里，虽有使臣难料理，呼天无路皱埋眉。自由为国例，何事学专制。不恃公理美人兮，困我监牢严密睇。狼虎差，横行更欲噬。罪及无辜真恶抵，几时出狱开心怀。
    这里，继续反映了华侨在“木屋”里的苦难生活，甚至连“音信”都“不容驿使递”，歌中更进一步的指出“强权废约例”（当时日本就把约束日侨的条例反对掉了），弱国无外交（所以说“虽有使臣难料理”）。中国的使臣，甚至和美帝国主义者一鼻孔出气，反而责备华侨、特别是华工。中国的侨民、工人，到这时，已经看清楚了美帝国主义者简直是“虎狼”，“噬”人，横行霸道，不讲公理，撕毁了他们的假面具。
