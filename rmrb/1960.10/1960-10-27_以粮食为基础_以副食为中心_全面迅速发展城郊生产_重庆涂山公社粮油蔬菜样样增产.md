Taking Grain as the Foundation, Focusing on Non-Staple Foods
Comprehensively and Rapidly Developing Suburban Production
Grain, Oil, and Vegetables All Increase Production in Chongqing's Tushan Commune

(Our newspaper, Chongqing, 26th) How can people's communes in the suburban rural areas of large cities, with less land, complex crop varieties, and competition among various crops for land, fertilizer, and labor, implement the policy of taking grain as the foundation and non-staple foods as the central link in suburban agricultural production, and rationally arrange various crops? The Tushan People's Commune in the suburbs of Chongqing has gained good experience in this regard.

In resolutely implementing the policy of suburban agricultural production, the commune fully utilized the growth laws and characteristics of crops, boldly reformed the farming system, and vigorously engaged in intercropping and interplanting of vegetables and grains, thereby improving land utilization. This enabled vegetables, grains, and various diversified crops to achieve continuous leap-forward development since 1959. Especially this year, after the widespread promotion of this farming system throughout the commune, the land utilization rate in the first half of the year reached 370%, an increase of 70% over the same period last year. The total output of spring grains increased by 21% compared to last year, and the total output of early rice, early corn, and other grains increased by 6.9% compared to last year. The soybeans and mung beans intercropped in orchards and woodlands also yielded good harvests. After adopting intercropping and interplanting for autumn sweet potatoes, the planting area expanded by more than 3,000 mu compared to last year; and the total vegetable production for the year is still expected to increase by about double compared to last year.

The Tushan People's Commune is a suburban commune primarily focused on vegetable production. With the development of urban industry and the increasing demand for non-staple foods, it is necessary not only to vigorously develop vegetable production and animal husbandry production, mainly pig raising, but also to maximize grain production. However, the contradiction between vegetables and grains has not been resolved for a long time. Since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the establishment of people's communes has created favorable conditions for further resolving this contradiction, and cadres and the masses have actively sought ways to achieve simultaneous leap-forward development of vegetables and grains. The leading cadres of the commune's Party committee led a work team to the Wenfeng Management Area (now the Wenfeng Cultivation Area of the Huangjueya Management Area) to study the local farmers' intercropping methods for vegetables and grains. After analysis by cadres and the masses, it was believed that this farming method was based on years of production experience, utilizing natural conditions and crop growth characteristics to improve land utilization and ensure increased production of both vegetables and grains. Therefore, they further analyzed the internal connections between crops, turned unfavorable factors into favorable ones, rationally combined them, and vigorously engaged in intercropping and interplanting of vegetables and grains. In 1959, the method of wide-row intercropping was adopted, and the intercropping and interplanting of vegetables and grains were trialed on 3,100 mu of land in this area. One method focused on grain with intercropped vegetables, and the other focused on vegetables with intercropped grain. After doing so, the multiple cropping index reached 550% due to the full utilization of land and space, and different crops also played a role in learning from each other's strengths and promoting mutual growth, resulting in an increase of 35.3% in the total grain output of the entire management area compared to 1958, and a doubling of vegetable production.

This year, after comprehensively summarizing the intercropping and interplanting experience of this management area, the commune widely trialed and promoted it throughout the commune. Based on further experience gained through repeated practice and research, the commune developed the forms of intercropping and interplanting from the original two or three types to six types: combining tall-stalk grains with creeping melons and vegetables; combining short-stem eggplants and fruits with leafy vegetables; combining deep-rooted crops with shallow-rooted crops; combining leguminous crops with gramineous crops; combining climbing crops with tall, upright crops; and combining crops with long growth periods with crops with short growth periods. Recently, the commune has also adopted this intercropping and interplanting method to arrange next year's agricultural production as early as possible. The result of the arrangement is that not only can the vegetable planting area of the entire commune continue to expand next year, but also the grain planting area can be increased, and the multiple cropping index will also be increased accordingly.

Currently, the commune has made specific arrangements based on next year's production plan and is vigorously grasping preparatory work. The main labor force of the entire commune has been put into deep plowing and fertilizer accumulation, and more than 4,000 mu of land for spring crops has been leveled.

    以粮食为基础  以副食为中心
    全面迅速发展城郊生产
    重庆涂山公社粮油蔬菜样样增产
    本报重庆26日电　大城市郊区农村人民公社在土地较少、作物品种复杂、多种作物互相争地、争肥料、争劳力的情况下，如何贯彻执行郊区农业生产以粮食为基础，以副食品为中心环节的方针，合理安排各项作物？重庆市郊区涂山人民公社在这方面取得了良好的经验。
    这个公社在坚决贯彻执行郊区农业生产的方针中，充分利用农作物的生长规律和特性，大胆改革耕作制度，大搞菜、粮间种、套种，提高了土地的利用率，使菜、粮和多种经营作物，从1959年以来，连续获得全面跃进。特别是今年，在全公社普遍推广这种耕作制度以后，上半年的土地利用率达到370％，比去年同期提高了70％。小春粮食总产量比去年增加21％，早稻、早玉米等粮食总产量比去年增加6.9％，利用花果林木地间种的黄豆、绿豆也得到了多收，大春红苕采用间种、套种后，栽种面积比去年扩大了三千多亩；而全年的蔬菜生产仍可比去年增加一倍左右。
    涂山人民公社是郊区一个以蔬菜生产为主的公社。随着城市工业的发展，对副食品需要的增多，不仅需要大力发展蔬菜生产和以养猪为主的畜牧业生产，而且粮食生产也要多多益善。但长期以来，菜、粮矛盾没有得到解决。1958年大跃进以来，随着人民公社的成立，为进一步解决这个矛盾创造了有利条件，干部和群众都积极寻求实现菜、粮同时跃进的途径。公社党委领导干部率领工作组到文峰管理区（现在是黄桷垭管理区的文峰耕作区）研究当地农民菜、粮间作的耕作办法，经过干部和群众的分析，认为这种耕作办法是根据多年的生产经验，利用了自然条件和作物的生长特性，提高土地利用率，保证菜、粮增产的一种科学的耕作办法。于是进一步分析了作物之间的内在联系，把不利的因素变为有利的因素，加以合理组合，大搞菜、粮间种、套种。1959年采取宽行间种的办法，在这个地区的三千一百亩土地上试行了菜、粮间种和套种。一种是以粮为主间种蔬菜；另一种是以菜为主间种粮食。这样做了以后，因为充分利用了土地和空间，使复种指数达到了550％，而不同作物也起到了取长补短、互相促进的作用，使全管理区的粮食总产量比1958年增加35.3％，蔬菜增产了一倍。
    今年，这个公社在全面总结了这个管区的套种、间种的经验后，在全社普遍试行推广。经过再次的实践和钻研，进一步取得经验的基础上，这个公社又将间种、套种制度的形式由原来的两、三种发展到了六种：即高秆粮食与匍匐瓜菜相结合；矮茎茄果与叶类蔬菜相结合；深根作物与浅根作物相结合；豆科作物与禾本科作物相结合；攀缘作物与高秆直立作物相结合；生长期长与生长期短的作物相结合。最近，这个公社又采取这种间种、套种的办法，及早安排了明年的农业生产。安排的结果，不仅明年全社蔬菜种植面积可以继续扩大，粮食种植面积也能增加，复种指数也将相应提高很多。
    目前，公社已根据明年生产计划进行具体安排，并狠抓准备工作。全社主要劳动力已投入了深翻土地和积肥等工作，全公社已平整小春地四千多亩。
