    Ammonia Water

    Nitrogen and hydrogen in the air, after undergoing chemical changes in special machinery and equipment, become ammonia gas, called synthetic ammonia. Ammonia gas can be combined with sulfuric acid to produce ammonium sulfate, with nitric acid to produce ammonium nitrate, and with hydrochloric acid to produce ammonium chloride. If ammonia gas is passed into water, it becomes ammonia water. Ammonia water is a nitrogenous chemical fertilizer.

    Ammonia water is a liquid with a strong, pungent odor, much like the smell of human excrement and urine. Ammonia water made from synthetic ammonia is a colorless liquid. Usually, every 100 jin of ammonia water contains about 16.5 jin of nitrogen fertilizer.

    氨水
    空气中的氮气和氢气经过特殊的机器设备，发生化学变化后，便变成氨气，叫做合成氨。氨气和硫酸化合能制成硫酸铵，和硝酸化合能制成硝酸铵，和盐酸化合能制成氯化铵。如果把氨气通入水中，就变成了氨水。氨水是一种氮素化学肥料。
    氨水是液体的，具有强烈的刺激性臭味，就像人粪尿臭味一样。用合成氨制成的氨水是无色的液体。通常每一百斤氨水约含有十六斤半氮肥。
