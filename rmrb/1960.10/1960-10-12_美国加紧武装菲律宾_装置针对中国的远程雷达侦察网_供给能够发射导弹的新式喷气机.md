Xinhua News Agency, Manila, 11th: U.S. imperialism and the reactionary rulers of the Philippines are stepping up their efforts to build the Philippines into a U.S. radar reconnaissance base against China.

According to a Reuters report, the Philippines is accelerating the installation of an extensive radar warning network. This radar warning network will be "jointly" managed by U.S. and Philippine officers. It is reported that the first batch of long-range radar equipment will begin operations in northern Luzon Island before the end of this year, with one radar station having a reconnaissance range of more than 250 miles. The report goes on to say that when all the new equipment is completed, it will form a huge radar network capable of exploring the Pacific region "far beyond the borders of the Philippines."

Reuters purposefully emphasized that the Philippines "is located in the Western Pacific, only a few hundred miles from the Chinese mainland."

The report also revealed that the United States will provide the Philippines with twenty F-86D jet fighters with missile launchers. Two of them have already been handed over to the Philippine Air Force in August for pilot training.

Reuters also reported that since May of this year, the United States has handed over anti-submarine port defense equipment and some patrol gunboats to the Philippines. Soon, the 2,130-ton high-speed escort destroyer "Bowers" will also be handed over to the Philippines.

After the Philippines was tied to the U.S. chariot, the result was a continuous increase in military spending. In the 1959-60 fiscal year, the armed forces budget was as high as 163.3 million pesos, while in 1949, when the Philippine reactionary authorities went all out to frantically suppress the people's armed forces, military spending was only 79 million pesos. (According to the exchange rate of two pesos to one U.S. dollar).

    供给能够发射导弹的新式喷气机
    新华社11日讯　马尼拉消息：美帝国主义和菲律宾反动统治者正在加紧把菲律宾建成为美国针对中国的雷达侦察基地。
    据路透社报道，菲律宾正在加速装置一个广泛的雷达警报网。这个雷达警报网将由美国和菲律宾军官“共同”管理。据报道，它的第一批远程雷达设备，将在今年底以前在吕宋岛北部开始使用，它的一个雷达站的侦察范围即达二百五十英里以上。报道接着说，当所有新设备建成后，将形成一个能探索“远远超出菲律宾国界以外”的太平洋地区的巨大雷达网。
    路透社不无用意地强调，菲律宾“是位于西太平洋离中国大陆只有几百英里”的国家。
    报道还透露，美国将给菲律宾二十架有导弹发射装置的F—86D型喷气战斗机。其中两架已在8月份交菲律宾空军用来训练驾驶员。
    路透社还报道，从今年5月以来，美国已经把反潜艇的港口防御设备和一些巡逻炮舰交给了菲律宾。不久还将把一艘二千一百三十吨的高速度的护航驱逐舰“鲍尔斯号”交给菲律宾。
    菲律宾被绑在美国战车上后，结果是，军费不断增加。在1959—60财政年度中，武装部队预算高达一亿六千三百三十多万比索，而在1949年当菲律宾反动当局全力疯狂镇压人民武装时，军费也不过七千九百多万比索。（按二比索等于一美元）
