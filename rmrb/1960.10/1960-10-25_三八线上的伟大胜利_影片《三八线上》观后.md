    The Great Victory on the 38th Parallel
    --After Watching the Film "On the 38th Parallel"
  　Zhao Teng
    On the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, our people are pleased to see another historical record reflecting the defeat of the allegedly powerful U.S. imperialism by the Chinese and Korean people's armies – "On the 38th Parallel." This film successfully reflects the tragic end of U.S. imperialism, from its initiation of aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea starting "On the 38th Parallel" to its being driven back south of the 38th parallel by the Chinese and Korean people's armies. The white band along the 38th parallel in the film records the defeats of the belligerent bloc headed by U.S. imperialism, and even more so, it records the victory of the Chinese and Korean people, marking the victory of the socialist camp and the just forces of peace-loving countries!
    Ten years ago today, when U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique frantically crossed the 38th parallel to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Chinese and Korean people, and peace-loving people all over the world, repeatedly issued serious warnings to the aggressors. However, war-loving U.S. imperialism regarded the calls for justice as a sign of weakness. It held the torch of aggression to the banks of the Yalu River, and arrogantly clamored: the Yalu River is not an insurmountable barrier. This once again nakedly exposed that this most ferocious enemy of the world's people—U.S. imperialism—was not reconciled to its defeat in China; nor did it want to learn a lesson from the ghosts of Hitler and Hideki Tojo. On the contrary, it attempted to inherit the mantle of past Japanese militarism, first occupying Korea and then invading China. At this critical moment, the great Chinese people, in order to join hands with the Korean people to crush the aggressors, to prevent the 650 million liberated Chinese people from becoming slaves of U.S. imperialism again, to safeguard the dignity of world peace, and to defend the eastern position of the socialist camp, declared the solemn position of the great People's Republic of China that it "cannot stand idly by" in the face of U.S. imperialism's aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; resolutely dispatched its outstanding sons and daughters—the Chinese People's Volunteers—who, valiantly and spiritedly crossing the Yalu River together with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, with the full sympathy and strong support of peace-loving countries and people, after nearly three years of heroic fighting, finally completely defeated the so-called powerful No. 1 enemy of the people of the world—the U.S. imperialist aggressor army. It was driven back to the position where it launched the war—the 38th parallel, making the seemingly powerful U.S. imperialism, this paper tiger, once again punctured by the Chinese and Korean people, revealing its true colors in front of peace-loving people all over the world; forcing it to obediently sign the "Korean Armistice Agreement."
    However, the aggressive nature of imperialism will not change. Although they signed the armistice agreement, they still tried every possible means to carry out aggressive activities. From the film "On the 38th Parallel," we can clearly see that even if U.S. imperialism is defeated, it will not willingly admit defeat. Look! When the spies it sent were captured by our people's police, with both human and material evidence, the rogue and rascal diplomatic methods of Colonel Davis, the spokesperson for U.S. imperialism, are undoubtedly the embodiment of the Eisenhower and other rulers of the United States. This is the sickening so-called "freedom" and "noble" moral standard of the hypocritical imperialists.
    The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement was not because U.S. imperialism showed kindness to the Korean people and laid down its butcher knife, but precisely because the iron fists of the Chinese and Korean people knocked down its butcher knife. As U.S. Army Colonel Davis in the film "On the 38th Parallel" confessed: "The armistice is our means, not our goal." This "negative teacher" spoke "well"! He revealed in one sentence that the defeated U.S. imperialism will still pick up the butcher knife at any time. The film also reveals that although U.S. imperialism put its seal on the world-renowned 38th parallel armistice agreement, it has never forgotten its despicable sabotage activities. In addition to seeing in the film that it repeatedly sent spies and spared no effort to use Japanese war criminals—Taro Yamamoto—to carry out sabotage, provocations in the air and at sea have never stopped. Since the armistice agreement came into effect, U.S. imperialism has not only shipped a large number of new weapons into South Korea and established nuclear weapons bases, but also frantically held large-scale nuclear war exercises near the 38th parallel. Although U.S. imperialism's various conspiracies to undermine the armistice agreement have been crushed and ruthlessly exposed by the Chinese and Korean people, as Chairman Mao said: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until their extinction—that is the logic of the imperialists and all reactionaries in the world. They will never go against this logic." The short history of the Korean War once again and eloquently proves this Marxist-Leninist law.
    From the film "On the 38th Parallel," we cannot help but recall: those heroic images of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people who shed their blood on Korean soil to defend the peace of the Far East and the world; recall the Chinese People's Volunteers' heroic spirit of proudly despising U.S. imperialism!
    The friendship forged with blood by the Chinese and Korean people in the battle against the common enemy has yielded fruitful results. From the meticulous care of "Amani" for the volunteer soldiers like a mother in the film, deeply expresses the heroic Korean people's internationalist class feelings towards the Chinese people! This profound feeling of the Korean people has greatly enhanced the Chinese people's internationalist thinking, and will surely educate our descendants to never forget it for generations to come.
    It has been more than two years since the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from North Korea. But the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops are still赖(reluctantly) in South Korea. This negative teacher of the people all over the world directly educated the people of South Korea, making them open their eyes and see clearly that their irreconcilable enemy is U.S. imperialism, which acts as a world "policeman". Look! Isn't the Syngman Rhee puppet it fostered has been swept by the anti-American storm of the South Korean people to the United States across the Atlantic to take shelter! The current "Heo Jeong" is already under the resolute attack of the South Korean people, and his future will certainly not be better than his "superior". History has proven countless times that all reactionaries who rely on bayonets to rule the people are paper tigers, and they will be overthrown by the people sooner or later.
    U.S. imperialism must understand, as "Amani" accused in the film "On the 38th Parallel": "Korea is the Korea of ​​the Korean people, not the Korea of ​​the Americans. U.S. imperialism must get out of Korea immediately!"

    三八线上的伟大胜利
    ——影片《三八线上》观后
  　赵腾
    在中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战十周年的日子里，我国人民高兴地看到又一部反映中、朝人民军队打败号称强大的美帝国主义的历史记实——《三八线上》。这部影片成功地反映了美帝国主义从《三八线上》发动侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国开始到中、朝人民军队把它打回到三八线以南的惨败的结局。影片上沿三八线那条白带写下了以美帝国主义为首的好战集团的败迹，更写下了中、朝人民的胜利，标志着社会主义阵营及爱好和平的正义的力量的胜利！
    十年前的今天，当着美帝国主义和李承晚反动集团越过三八线向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国猖狂进攻时，中、朝人民、全世界爱好和平的人民曾迭次地向侵略者提出了严重的警告。但是，好战成性的美帝国主义对正义的呼声视为软弱的表现。它举着侵略的火把烧到鸭绿江边，并狂妄地叫嚣：鸭绿江并不是不可逾越的鸿沟。这再一次地赤裸裸地暴露了这个世界人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义并不甘心它在中国的失败；它也不想从希特勒、东条英机的阴魂中吸取教训。恰恰相反，它企图承袭过去日本军国主义首先占领朝鲜进而侵略中国的衣钵。就在这千钧一发的时刻，伟大的中国人民为了同朝鲜人民并肩粉碎侵略者，为不使六亿五千万解放了的中国人民再做美帝国主义的奴隶，为了维护世界和平的尊严，为了保卫社会主义阵营东方的阵地，申明了伟大的中华人民共和国对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国“不能置之不理”的严正立场；毅然地派遣了自己的优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军，雄赳赳、气昂昂跨过鸭绿江与朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军一道在爱好和平的国家和人民的充分同情和大力支持下，经过了将近三年的英勇战斗，终于把号称强大的全世界人民的头号敌人——美帝国主义侵略军彻底的打败了。把它打退到它发动战争的位置上——三八线，使貌似强大的美帝国主义这只纸老虎又一次地被中、朝人民戳穿了，使它在全世界爱好和平的人民面前现了原形；迫使它不得不在“和平停战协定”上乖乖地签字。
    然而，帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的。他们虽然在停战协定上签了字，但仍然千方百计地进行侵略活动。从影片“三八线上”，我们清楚的看到，美帝国主义即使被打败了，它还是不会甘败下风的。请看！当它派遣的间谍被我方民警擒获，人证、物证俱在的情况下，作为美帝国主义代言人的台维斯上校那种流氓、无赖的外交手段，无疑就是美国统治集团艾森豪威尔之流的化身。这就是衣冠禽兽的帝国主义者令人作呕的所谓“自由”、“高尚”的道德标准。
    朝鲜停战协定的签字，并非美帝国主义对朝鲜人民发出善心才放下屠刀的，恰恰相反，这是中、朝人民钢铁般的拳头打落下它的屠刀的结果。正如影片《三八线上》美军上校台维斯自供的：“停战是我们的手段，不是我们的目的”。这个“反面教员”讲得“好”！他一言道破：被击败了的美帝国主义还要随时操起屠刀的。影片还揭示出：尽管美帝国主义在举世瞩目的三八线停战协定上画了押，但是它们一刻也没有忘记卑鄙的捣乱活动。我们除在影片上看到它三番五次地派遣间谍和不惜起用日寇战犯——山本太郎进行破坏外，就是在空中、海上的挑衅也一直没有停止过。停战协定生效至今，美帝国主义不但大量地把新式武器运进南朝鲜，建立原子武器基地，而且疯狂地在三八线附近举行大规模的原子战争演习。美帝国主义破坏停战协定的种种阴谋尽管遭到了中、朝人民的粉碎和无情的揭露，但是，正如毛主席说的：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑。”朝鲜战争短暂的历史再次地、雄辩地证明了这条马克思列宁主义的定律。
    从影片“三八线上”，不能不使我们想起：为了保卫远东和世界的和平事业，中国人民的优秀儿女把鲜血浇灌在朝鲜土地上的那些英雄的形象；想起中国人民志愿军那种豪迈的蔑视美帝国主义的英雄气概！
    中、朝人民在反击共同敌人的战斗中以鲜血凝成的友谊结出了丰硕的果实。从影片上“阿妈妮”对志愿军战士那种母亲般的无微不至的关怀，深刻地表达了英雄的朝鲜人民对待中国人民的国际主义的阶级的感情！朝鲜人民这种深厚的感情极大地提高了中国人民的国际主义思想，也必将教育着我们的子孙万代永世不忘。
    中国人民志愿军撤出北朝鲜已经两年多了。但是美帝国主义的侵略军队至今还赖在南朝鲜。这个全世界人民的反面教员，直接地教育了南朝鲜的人民，使他们擦亮了眼睛，看清了他们不共戴天的仇敌就是充当世界“宪兵”的美帝国主义。看！它一手豢养的李承晚傀儡不是已被南朝鲜人民的反美风暴卷到大西洋的美国窝藏起来了吗！现在的“许承晚”业已处在南朝鲜人民的坚决打击之下，其前途决不会比他的“顶头上司”更好些。历史无数次地证明了，凡是靠刺刀才能对人民实行统治的一切反动派都是纸老虎，它们迟早要被人民打翻的。
    美帝国主义必须明白，正如“三八线上”影片中“阿妈妮”所控诉的：“朝鲜是朝鲜人民的朝鲜，不是美国人的朝鲜。美帝国主义必须立刻滚出朝鲜去！”
