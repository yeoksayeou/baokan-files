Party Committee Secretary's Notes

    Grasp Production with One Hand, Grasp Life with the Other
    Li Rumei, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Hejian County Committee, Hebei

    Production and life are two mutually restrictive, mutually promoting, and inseparable aspects. Production is fundamental, the basis of life, but people carry out production, and to ensure the progress of production, people's lives must be well arranged. The fact that the Yue Zhuang Production Team of our county grasped production with one hand and life with the other, and that life was improved and production greatly increased, fully proves the truth pointed out in the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party: "The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party should care about the lives of the masses. The more the Party cares about the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be."
    The Yue Zhuang Production Team is a Class III team of the Wanquan Commune. Since this spring, the new Party branch has greatly grasped the people's lives while greatly grasping production. Appropriate arrangements have been made for the team members' clothing, food, housing, transportation, and all aspects of life such as the elderly, young, sick, and pregnant. The masses are satisfied, their morale is high, they are full of spirit, and their fighting spirit is high. In the words of the team members:
  “The more we work in production, the more energetic we become; the more we live, the more flavorful our lives become.” Therefore, this production team has changed its backward appearance in more than half a year and has achieved outstanding results in all aspects of production. Although this year is "four disasters combined (drought, flood, insects, and famine)", they still achieved a good harvest. The team members were all so happy that they couldn't close their mouths, praising in unison: "Old Xu is our good housekeeper."
    Xu Junshan, the Party branch secretary of the Yue Zhuang Production Team, is already fifty years old. Looking at his skinny body, he is always so energetic and spirited when he works. It is especially commendable that Old Xu always takes the worries of the masses as his own and the happiness of the masses as his own, and cares more about other people's affairs than his own. Team member Zhang Ruixiang's wife was sick, and his children were young, and he could not participate in production for a long time, so he had difficulty in life. Old Xu asked a doctor to prescribe medicine for Zhang Ruixiang's family, and arranged for the children to be placed in the nursery. During the day, the canteen cooks took turns to decoct the medicine and cook soup for the patients, so Zhang Ruixiang was able to free up his hands to participate in field production. Thanks to Old Xu's careful care and specific arrangements, the whole family was moved to tears, and Zhang Ruixiang repeatedly stated: "We must repay the Party's meticulous care with the best labor." Because Old Xu wholeheartedly serves the masses, gets up in the middle of the night and at five o'clock in the morning, does not avoid hardship, does not make special demands, eats, lives, labors, and consults with the masses, and always stands unremittingly on the front line of production and the front line of life, he enjoys a high prestige among the masses. All the men, women, old, and young in the team, no matter who sees him, always affectionately call him: "Old Xu,..."
    Old Xu, whose full name is Xu Junshan, is the new branch secretary who was elected this spring. As soon as Old Xu took on this work, he resolutely implemented the county party committee's instruction of "grasping production with one hand and life with the other." While comprehensively arranging the lives of the masses, he focused on the rectification, consolidation, and improvement of the public canteens. There are 192 households in this team, and the production team is divided into four small teams, one canteen for each small team. Nine branch committee members, except for one branch committee member in charge of water conservancy who lives at the wellhead, the remaining eight branch committee members, two branch committee members contract a small team and a canteen; each canteen has established a canteen management committee with the participation of team member representatives. In addition to mastering the overall situation, Old Xu regarded the third canteen as his "experimental field." During Old Xu's time as a cook in the canteen, in addition to resolutely fulfilling the systems of food grain management, daily financial clearing and monthly settlement, eating by ticket, and saving for oneself, he also solicited team members' reflections and requirements on the canteen through discussions with team members and door-to-door visits, and worked with the cooks and managers to study and improve the variety of meals. Under the leadership of Old Xu, the cooks and managers not only made the meals good and skillful, but also managed 262 mu of canteen household vegetables. The gourds, beans, Chinese cabbage, and carrots produced by the canteen ensured that each team member could eat two to three catties of vegetables a day. Now, all four canteens in the team have achieved having grain and vegetables, and having both porridge and dry food. The team members are particularly satisfied with the canteen, saying: "This is too good, it saves grain and we eat comfortably. Old Xu is too thoughtful for us."
    Old Xu deeply realized that the cooks and managers are the direct organizers of the lives of the masses, and the quality of life arrangements depends to a large extent on them. Therefore, he not only tried his best to improve the food for the team members, but also effectively grasped the ideological and political work of the cooks and managers, and used every opportunity to explain to the cooks and managers the truth that serving people is the most glorious in our new society. Therefore, a strong view of serving the people has been established among the cooks and managers.
    The team members were deeply moved by the meticulous care of the cooks and managers led by Old Xu. They love the canteen, care about the canteen, and respect the cooks. The new communist ethos has been greatly promoted. Every night, many team members help the canteen wash vegetables, mix noodles, fetch water, and carry firewood. Everyone feels satisfied to do something for the canteen.
    Because the Party branch of the Yue Zhuang Production Team grasped production with one hand and life with the other, the life was well arranged, and the team members were highly motivated, a lively and vigorous political situation was formed in the whole team. Everyone is selfless, does not talk about conditions, and labors and produces enthusiastically. The attendance rate has increased to more than 95%. In July, several consecutive rainstorms flooded the five hundred mu of crops in the southeast depression, which was prone to flooding every year. Under the leadership of Old Xu, more than a hundred team members, carrying shovels and hoes, automatically rushed to the scene, braved the heavy rain, and fought for a night, digging a drainage ditch one li long and one meter wide, protecting the five hundred mu of corn from loss.
    It can be seen that running collective life well can not only promote people's enthusiasm for production, but also change people's spiritual outlook and strengthen people's communist ideology of loving the collective.

    一手抓生产一手抓生活
    中共河北河间县委员会书记处书记　李汝梅
    生产和生活是相互制约相互促进不可分割的两个方面。生产是根本，是生活的基础，但是，进行生产的是人，要保证生产的进行，就必须安排好人的生活。我县岳庄生产队的党支部一手抓生产，一手抓生活，生活搞得好，生产大提高的事实，充分地证明了党的八届六中全会决议中所指明的：“群众的干劲越大，党越要关心群众生活。党越是关心群众生活，群众的干劲也会越大。”的真理。
    岳庄生产队，是万全公社的一个三类队。今春以来，新的党支部在大抓生产的同时，大抓了人民生活。对社员的衣食住行，老幼病孕等各项生活问题，都作了适当安排。群众满意，情绪高涨，意气风发，斗志昂扬，用社员的话来说：
  “生产越干越有劲，生活越过越有味。”因而，这个生产队，在半年多的时间内，改变了落后面貌，在各项生产上，都取得了出色的成绩。虽然今年是“四灾（旱、涝、虫、荒）并举”，但是，他们仍然获得了很好的收获。社员们个个乐得闭不上嘴，齐声称赞：“老徐是俺们好管家的。”
    岳庄生产队的党支部书记徐俊山已经是五十岁的人了，看身子骨瘦巴巴的，可是干起活来，做起工作来，总是那么带劲，那么有精神。特别值得称颂的是，老徐平日总是以群众之忧为己忧，以群众之乐为己乐，关心别人的事情，比关心自己的事情还上心。社员张瑞祥，老婆有病，孩子又小，长期不能参加生产，因而生活困难。老徐给张瑞祥家请医生抓药吃，又把小孩安置到托儿所里，白天由食堂炊事员轮班来给病人煎药熬汤，张瑞祥得以腾出手来参加田间生产。由于老徐的细心照顾，具体安排，全家都感动得流下眼泪，张瑞祥一再表示：“一定要以最好的劳动来报答党无微不至的关怀。”因为老徐全心实意为群众，睡半夜起五更，不辞辛苦不闹特殊，和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，始终不懈地站在生产第一线，生活第一线，在群众中享有很高的威信。全队男女老幼，无论谁见了他，总是要亲亲热热地称呼他一句：“老徐，……”
    老徐，全名叫徐俊山，是今年春天才被选上的新支部书记。老徐一担任这工作，就坚决贯彻执行了县委关于“一手抓生产，一手抓生活”的指示，在全面安排群众生活的同时，重点抓住了公共食堂的整顿巩固和提高工作。这个队共一百九十二户，生产队下分四个小队，一个小队一个食堂，九个支部委员，除一个管水利的支委住在机井口外，其余八个支委，两个支委包一个小队包一个食堂；每个食堂都成立了有社员代表参加的食堂管理委员会。老徐除掌握全面外，第三食堂是他的“试验田”。老徐在食堂当炊事员期间，除坚决兑现了粮食食用管理、财务日清月结、凭票吃饭，节约归己等制度外，还通过和社员座谈、登门访问，征求社员对食堂的反映和要求，和炊事员、管理员一起研究改进了饭菜花样。炊事员和管理员在老徐的带动下，不但把饭菜做得又好又巧，而且还管理了二百六十二亩食堂家底菜，食堂生产的北瓜、豆角、大白菜、葫萝卜，保证了每个社员一天能吃上二三斤菜。现在，全队四个食堂都做到了有粮有菜，有稀有干。社员们对食堂特别满意，说：“这样太好了，既节约了粮食，又吃得舒服。老徐为我们想得太周到了。”
    老徐深深地体会到，炊事员、管理员是群众生活的直接组织者，生活安排得好坏，在很大程度上取决于他们。所以，他不但千方百计地想方设法为社员们改善伙食，而且还切实地抓住了炊事员、管理员的思想政治工作，利用一切机会给炊事员、管理员讲解在我们新社会里，伺候人是最光荣的道理。因此在炊事员、管理员中树立起了坚强的为人民服务的观点。
    社员们在以老徐为首的炊事员、管理员的无微不至的关怀下，深受感动。他们热爱食堂，关心食堂，尊敬炊事员，共产主义的新风尚得到了大大的发扬。每天晚上都有不少的社员帮助食堂洗菜、合面、挑水、担柴，每一个人都觉得给食堂干点事才心满意足。
    由于岳庄生产队党支部一手抓生产，一手抓生活，生活安排得好，社员干劲高，在全队形成了一派生动活泼的大好政治局面。人人都是不计报酬，不讲条件，忘我地劳动，热情地生产。出勤率提高到95％以上。7月，连续几场暴雨，东南洼年年易涝的五百亩庄稼，被涝水所淹，社员们在老徐的带动下，一百多人携锨扛镐，自动地奔赴现场，冒着大雨，奋战一宿，挖了一条一里长、一米宽的排水渠，保住了五百亩大玉米免受损失。
    由此可见，办好集体生活，不仅可以促进人们的生产积极性，而且可以改变人们的精神面貌，加强人们热爱集体的共产主义思想。
