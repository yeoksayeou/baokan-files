Huang Zhongquan, Chairman of the meeting, pointed out in his speech that with the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, the boundary between China and Burma will become a boundary of peace and friendship. The edifice of Sino-Burmese friendship is not only the crystallization of the deep friendship between our two peoples, but also will have a great impact on peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among Asian countries.
