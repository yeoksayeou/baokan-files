Contributing to the Processing of Agricultural and Sideline Products

    While autumn crops are being harvested in large quantities, the preliminary processing of agricultural and sideline products is being placed on the agenda with increasing urgency. Processing agricultural and sideline products is an indispensable link in the process from harvesting to distribution and consumption: harvested cotton needs to be processed into lint cotton to supply the textile sector for production; tobacco leaves must be tied and baked before they can be used to make cigarettes; large quantities of rice, corn, and potatoes must be threshed and selected before they can be eaten and stored; and the extraction of fiber from hemp and cotton stalks requires preliminary processing... It is clear that processing the large variety and quantity of agricultural and sideline products in a timely manner to meet the needs of all aspects of the national economy is a task that requires a great deal of effort to complete.

    Processing agricultural and sideline products requires a certain amount of labor and machinery. In the current season of busy autumn plowing and planting, rural labor must first be guaranteed for agricultural production. It is unrealistic to expect to draw out a lot of labor for processing agricultural and sideline products. Moreover, relying solely on manual labor is time-consuming, laborious, and inefficient. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the technical force for processing, to demand labor from processing machinery, and to demand efficiency from the technological revolution. This is the main way to do a good job in processing agricultural and sideline products. In more than a month, the industrial departments of Jiahe County, Hebei Province, manufactured 2,100 processing machines such as sweet potato slicers and cotton stalk peelers for the county. Due to the widespread use of these machines, it is estimated that the county can save more than 4 million workdays by the end of the year. After comprehensively innovating cotton processing machinery this year, Pingquan District in Jianyang County, Sichuan, can not only save half the labor force compared to last year, but also complete the cotton processing task two months ahead of schedule. In fact, any link in the processing of agricultural and sideline products can use and create various machines to replace manual operation, or continuously improve the original machines to greatly improve labor efficiency.

    Striving to increase and improve processing machinery, replacing more manual operations, and saving agricultural labor requires support from all sides, especially strong support from industrial and commercial departments. The next three or four months will be a very busy and intense season for processing agricultural and sideline products. Under the unified leadership of the Party committees at all levels, industrial and commercial departments in various localities should conduct in-depth investigations and research, identify the key problems that urgently need to be solved in the process of processing agricultural and sideline products according to the specific local conditions, and meticulously do a series of tasks such as manufacturing, repairing, popularizing, innovating, and training technical personnel.

    为农副产品加工出力
    在秋收作物大量收获的同时，农副产品初步加工工作日益迫切地提到议事日程上来了。农副产品加工，这是从收获到分配、消费过程中一个必不可少的环节：收摘下来的棉花，需要加工成皮棉才能供应纺织部门生产；烟叶必须经过扎把、烘烤以后才能制造卷烟；大量的稻谷、玉米、薯类也要经过脱粒、摘选然后才能食用和储存；至于从麻类、棉秆皮等取得纤维，更是无一不需要初步加工……。由此可见，要把品种、数量很多的农副产品及时进行加工处理，以满足国民经济各方面的需要，是一项需要付出很大努力才能完成的任务。
    加工农副产品需要一定的劳动力和机具。在目前秋耕秋种十分繁忙的季节，农村劳动力要首先保证农业生产。指望抽出很多的劳动力搞农副产品加工，是不现实的。而且，单靠手工劳动，既费时费事，效率又低，也不合算。因此，必须加强加工的技术力量，向加工机具要劳力，向技术革命要效率。这是做好农副产品加工工作的主要途径。河北省交河县工业部门在一个多月的时间内为全县制造出两千一百台白薯切片机、棉秆剥皮机等加工机具，由于广泛利用这些机具，预计到年底全县可节约四百多万个劳动日。四川简阳县平泉区今年全面革新棉花加工机具以后，不仅可以比去年节省一半的劳动力，而且可以提前两个月完成棉花加工任务。事实上，农副产品加工的任何环节都可以使用和创造各种机具代替手工操作，或者不断改进原有的机具来大大提高劳动效率。
    力争增加和改良加工机具，代替更多的手工操作，节约农业劳动力，这件事情需要各方面的支援，特别需要工业和商业部门的大力支援。今后三四个月内是农副产品加工十分繁忙、紧张的季节，各地工业和商业部门都应当在各级党委统一领导下，深入调查研究，根据当地具体情况，找出农副产品加工过程中迫切需要解决的关键问题，细致地做好制造、修理、推广、革新、培训技术人员等一系列的工作。
