    Handshake of Mutual Appreciation
    Tian Ma (Poetry), Fang Cheng (Painting)
    News report: U.S. President Eisenhower actually awarded the so-called "Legion of Merit," one of the highest American medals, to former Hitler General Heusinger, Inspector General and Chief of Staff of the West German Federal Defense Forces, to reward him for his contribution to the revival of West German militarism under the support of the United States.

    One is the American President,
    One is the Nazi General,
    They used to meet on the battlefield,
    But now they are extraordinarily close:
    "Reviving militarism,
    General, you are truly capable,
    Giving you a medal,
    Shows clear reward and punishment!"
    The General hurriedly replied:
    "This humble one is deeply grateful,
    Whatever instructions the President has,
    I will surely serve and give my life."
    The President, face full of smiles,
    OK! OK! repeatedly says:
    "In the future, when launching a war,
    The General will be the vanguard!"
    The two ask and answer,
    Expressing deep feelings for each other:
    They didn't recognize each other when they fought,
    Turns out they were family all along!

    授受相亲
    天马　诗  方成　画
    报载：美国总统艾森豪威尔竟以美国的最高勋章之一所谓“功劳勋章”，授给西德联邦国防军总监兼总参谋长，前希特勒将军豪辛格，奖励他在美国扶植下复活西德军国主义的功劳。
    一是美国总统，
    一是纳粹将军，
    从前战场相见，
    而今分外相亲：
    “复活军国主义，
    将军真是能人，
    授给勋章一个，
    才见赏罚分明！”
    将军连忙回禀：
    “小人感恩不轻，
    总统有何吩咐，
    定当效劳卖命。”
    总统满脸堆笑，
    OK！OK连声：
    “将来发动大战，
    将军就作先行”！
    两人一问一答，
    互相诉说深情：
    当初相打不相识，
    原来早是一家人！
