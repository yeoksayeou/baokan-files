A competition of catching up with each other is underway between the Shanghai Bicycle Factory, which produces "Forever" brand bicycles, and the Tianjin Bicycle Factory, which produces "Flying Pigeon" brand bicycles. These two factories exchange economic and technical data every month; and annually compare quality, output, cost, and variety. The idea of striving for first place and striving to be the best has taken root in the hearts of the people in both factories, becoming a common practice. Although the two factories are no less than two thousand li apart, they are now tightly connected by the red line of increasing production and practicing economy.

Once, the workers in the electroplating workshop of the Tianjin Bicycle Factory saw from the exchanged data that the electroplating cost of the Shanghai Bicycle Factory was six jiao lower than their own factory. The workers thought: Six jiao is a large number in the total electroplating cost of just over two yuan, and it is not easy to reduce it while ensuring quality. However, the workers said: We can definitely do what others can do, and we are determined to surpass them. So, they analyzed and studied each electroplating task one by one, and found that strictly controlling the electroplating solution and precise proportioning were the keys to reducing costs. The alloy plating team immediately strengthened contact with the solution adding team, formulated a solution adding system, and improved the operation of the plated parts, so as not to add randomly or waste any solution. Later, they developed a set of experiences in reducing electroplating costs from these scattered saving measures. After repeated efforts, they finally reduced the electroplating cost to two yuan, surpassing "Forever."

Now, the competition between these two factories is rising higher and higher. This time, "Flying Pigeon" has planted the red flag. In the next round, will "Forever" "catch up later"? (Fan) (Attached picture)

    两千里路一线串
    在生产永久牌自行车的上海自行车厂和生产飞鸽牌自行车的天津自行车厂之间，正开展着一场你追我赶的竞赛。这两个工厂，月月都要交换经济、技术资料；年年都要互相评比质量、产量、成本和品种。力争第一，力争上游的思想，在两个厂已深入人心，蔚然成风。虽然两个工厂相距不下两千里，但是现在已经被增产节约的红线紧紧地串联在一起了。
    有一次，天津自行车厂电镀车间的工人们，从互换的资料中，看到上海自行车厂的电镀成本比自己厂低六角钱。工人们想：六角钱在总共才二元多钱的电镀成本里，是一个很大的数字，要降下来，而且保证质量，不是很容易的事。可是工人们表示：别人办得到的事，我们一定办得到，而且坚决超过。于是，他们把电镀活逐件逐件地分析研究，找到了严格控制电镀药液和精密配比是降低成本的关键。镀合金小组马上和加药小组加强联系，制订了加药制度，改进了镀件操作，做到不乱加、不浪费一点药液。以后，他们又从这些零星的节约措施中发展成一套降低电镀成本的经验，经过再三努力，终于把电镀成本降低到二元钱，超过了“永久”。
    现在，这两个厂的竞赛正一浪高一浪，这次“飞鸽”插上了红旗，下一个回合，“永久”是不是又要“后来居上”？。　（凡）（附图片）
