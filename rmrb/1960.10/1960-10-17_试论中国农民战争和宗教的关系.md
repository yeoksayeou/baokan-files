Editor's Note: The relationship between peasant wars and religion in China's feudal era is a topic currently under discussion in Chinese historical circles. This article presents some ideas for discussion on this issue. We are publishing it now for readers' reference.

I. How Should We Understand That Religion is "The Opium of the People"?

Religion is a form of social ideology, a reflection of the objective world in people's minds, but not a true and scientific reflection. Religion does not understand the world as it is, but rather reflects the objective world in a distorted and inverted manner. Therefore, it is said that religion is a "reversed worldview." According to religious views, the natural phenomena of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning, as well as human life, death, fortune, and misfortune, are all controlled by a mysterious and unpredictable supernatural force. Therefore, people are powerless in the face of the spontaneous forces of nature or society and can only obey the arbitrary manipulation of supernatural forces. Religion adopts a passive attitude towards natural disasters and social injustices, hindering people from correctly understanding the world and also hindering them from actively transforming the world. Because religion possesses this characteristic, it gains new vitality in class-antagonistic societies, is supported and utilized by reactionary ruling classes, and becomes a spiritual weapon to rule the people.

In class societies, all reactionary ruling classes need two social functions to maintain their rule: one is the function of the executioner, and the other is the function of the missionary. The former uses force to suppress the resistance of the oppressed classes, while the latter uses religion to numb the revolutionary will of the masses. Religion serving the exploiting classes, despite its various forms and changes, has a common characteristic, which is to promote class peace, defend the existing ruling order, and teach the people to be gentle and obedient to the oppressors and to endure their poverty and suffering silently. Almost all religions fabricate a "happy paradise" in the "afterlife" for the laborers, in order to make them endure exploitation and oppression in this life without complaint. Religion poisons the revolutionary consciousness of the masses and undermines their revolutionary enthusiasm through these propagandas, thereby causing them to abandon revolutionary struggles and allowing the exploiters and oppressors to rule peacefully. Therefore, religion is a kind of spiritual oppression and the opium that anesthetizes the people.

In Chinese history, there have been various religions, among which Taoism, Buddhism, and Christianity have had a greater impact.

Taoism is a religion native to China. Its first classic, the *Taiping Jing* (*Scripture of Great Peace*), served the exploiting classes. It portrays the hierarchical system of social classes as an immutable natural law, arranged by the gods, and cannot be changed by human power. It tries its best to defend the system of human exploitation, saying that the production of grains by farmers and the production of wealth by slaves are all arrangements of the heavens, and no one should violate them. In order to make the oppressed forever content with their poor and miserable fate, it also promotes the idea of ​​contentment with poverty and lowliness in large quantities. It says: "Contentment with poverty and lowliness can last a long time, seeking nobility in return hinders the way." It also says: "All people and slaves should be kind and not do evil, which is a sign of great joy in heaven and earth." These ideas in the *Taiping Jing* can be said to have basically laid the foundation of Taoist dogma. No matter how many dynastic changes it has undergone, its basic ideas have not undergone essential changes. Let's take a look at the *Yunji Qiqian* (*Seven Tablets in a Cloudy Satchel*), which was compiled eight or nine centuries later. Of course, the dogma has undergone many evolutions, but the toxins can be said to remain the same despite all changes. It says that poverty is determined by fate, "which cannot be escaped or complained about. Only wise men will be good at it, be happy with fate, and not feel the bitterness of poverty." It contains many precepts, such as "Do not be tired of poverty and lowliness, and seek wealth and nobility by force"; "Do not rebel against the monarch or plot against the country," and so on. There are also many admonitions. For example, when talking about so-called "respecting hundreds of medicines," there are "loving even when hating is a medicine," "not despising when encroached is a medicine," "not getting angry when insulted is a medicine," "being content with poverty and not complaining is a medicine," and so on. Without much analysis, the reactionary role of this kind of preaching is very obvious.

Interestingly, Christianity, which originated thousands of kilometers away, has a similar tone to Taoism. Although Christianity originated among the lower classes, after it was declared the state religion of the Roman Empire, it defended the exploitation system through various preachings, advocated the necessity of class existence, and praised timidity, inferiority, gentleness, submission, and obedience. Not only should one not resist enemies, but one should also love them, bless them, and pray for them. As Luke 6 says: "But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you." That's not enough, it further teaches people that if someone hits you on your right cheek, turn your left cheek to be hit; if someone wants to take your coat, let them take your inner garment. And all of this is declared to be God's will. It is obvious that if laborers acted according to God's will, there would be no mass resistance movements and no mass revolutionary wars.

However, the role of religion is, after all, limited. Although it tries its best to promote class harmony, class contradictions are irreconcilable. Although it teaches laborers to be obedient and patient, the oppressed are unwilling and unable to endure under cruel exploitation and oppression. They held thousands of large and small uprisings to resist this exploitation and oppression. It can be seen that although religion has poisoned the consciousness of the masses and affected their struggles, it ultimately cannot shake the revolutionary determination of the masses or extinguish the revolutionary flames of the masses.

II. What are the Characteristics of the Religion Utilized by Peasant Wars?

The broad masses of the laboring people not only broke through the shackles of religious thought and launched countless large-scale uprisings, but also sometimes utilized religion in the process of uprisings. This utilization is possible because, on the one hand, the peasants are not atheists, they believe in gods and worship supernatural powers; on the other hand, it is also because religious thought has certain elements that can be utilized. As everyone knows, religion poisons the consciousness of the masses by adopting a deceptive and foolish form, and therefore often wraps an attractive sugar coating on the outside of its toxins. In terms of this sugar coating, it is nothing more than advocating equality, advocating light, yearning for heavenly happiness, and so on. Needless to say, these ideas are easily combined with the revolutionary demands of the masses at that time. For example, religious propaganda says that everyone is equal in heaven, but the peasant class uses it to strive for equality in the world; religion hypocritically promotes advocating brightness and justice and opposing darkness and evil, but the peasant class uses it to expound revolutionary ideas of striving for happiness and opposing oppression and exploitation; religion uses "heaven" to comfort the oppressed, but the peasant class uses it to awaken yearning for a better future; religion defends the existing ruling order and promotes divine right of kings, but the peasant class also claims to be ordained by heaven in order to seize power. In Chinese history, some peasant wars have utilized religion. For example, the Yellow Turban Uprising at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty utilized Taoism, the Fang La Uprising at the end of the Northern Song Dynasty utilized Manichaeism, the uprising led by Han Shantong and Liu Futong at the end of the Yuan Dynasty utilized the White Lotus Sect, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in modern times utilized Christianity, and the Yihetuan also utilized the White Lotus Sect. Judging from Chinese history, the utilization of religion in peasant wars is nothing more than the following two situations. One is to reform the religion that serves the ruling class and circulates among the people, and create a new religion that meets their own needs and is different from the religion of the ruling class; the other is to utilize the religion that is strictly prohibited by the ruling class and secretly circulated among the people. These religions played a certain positive role in the peasant wars, becoming a tool for organizing and mobilizing the masses.

These religions played a positive role in the peasant wars because they differed from the religion of the ruling class and had many new characteristics as follows:

First, it has a strong fighting spirit, which is especially evident in the interpretation of the term "Taiping" ("Great Peace"). The religion of the ruling class often interprets the word "Taiping" as "the three stages are right, it is Taiping," "a lucky star appears, it is Taiping," or "the six unions are in the same style, all countries are in the same track, the emperor is wise and things are prosperous." Or, like the words of the *Taiping Jing* quoted by *Yunji Qiqian*: "Clearing up great chaos, great merit and proper virtue, so it is called Taiping." However, in the religious dogmas created by the peasant class, there are different interpretations of the word "Taiping." For example, in a Fūjī poem circulating among the people at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, there were two lines that said: "The unequal people kill the unequal, killing all the unequal is Taiping." Another example is the *Taiping Salvation Song* of the God Worshipping Society, which says: "Sweep away the demons, the world is peaceful." It also says: "Waiting to see the demons destroyed quickly, the world is pure, the country is unified, and the world is peaceful for all ages." This interpretation does not have the color of class harmony, but has a strong fighting atmosphere. In addition, such as the Ming religion dogma advocating the struggle between "light" and "darkness," it is believed that in the second stage of the struggle, light will defeat darkness. Another example is the God Worshipping Society. Although it was created by utilizing Christianity, it does not have the Christian dogma of loving enemies; on the contrary, it broadly refers to the oppressors and exploiters in the world as Yama demons, and points out that this Yama demon is "all our brothers and sisters in the world who should be jointly attacked and fear not to be quick."

Second, these religions do not defend the existing ruling order, but defend the revolutionary cause of the peasant class. For example, the Taiping religion at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty declared "The blue sky is dead, the yellow sky should stand, the year is Jiazi, the world is auspicious." The anti-Yuan uprising led by Liu Futong used "Maitreya Buddha is born, the Ming King is born" to prove that his actions were ordained by heaven. The God Worshipping Society preached that God had given Hong Xiuquan a heavenly book, a sword, and a seal, ordering him to kill all the demons and ghosts in the world. The Yihetuan's inscription has "God helps the fists, the Yihetuan, only because the ghosts are making trouble in the Central Plains ... God is angry, the immortals are annoyed, and they go down the mountain to preach." The oracle says "A sea of ​​suffering has no end in sight, and the little gods are busy walking in the world, and 80,000 or 100,000 soldiers and gods rise up to sweep away the foreigners and create a new world."

Third, because these religions have a strong fighting spirit and defend the revolutionary cause of the peasant class, they are not allowed by the ruling class at the time, and are slandered as "demon religions," "cults," "heresies," and "teaching bandits," and are subjected to cruel armed suppression. Therefore, almost all religions utilized by peasant wars adopt secret activities.

Fourth, these religions, on the one hand, preach that they should wage a resolute struggle against the enemy, and on the other hand, they advocate mutual assistance, unity, and friendship within. Such a situation existed in the Taiping religion at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the Ming religion in the Song Dynasty, the White Lotus Sect in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and the God Worshipping Society of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom.

Fifth, these religions generally have ascetic colors, such as thin burials, vegetarianism, abstinence from alcohol, and abstinence from sex. This demand to abandon all worldly pleasures has a positive effect on peasant wars. Regarding this point, Engels has given clear instructions in his book *The Peasant War in Germany*. If you look at the surface phenomenon, the religion of the ruling class also has the advocacy of vegetarianism, frugality, abstinence from alcohol, abstinence from lust, etc., but that is a trick to fool people, saying that the more bitter life is in this life, the more beautiful life will be in the next life. The social role of this religious thought is reactionary.

III. Are Peasant Wars Necessarily Combined with Religion?

Many people believe that religion is necessary for peasant wars. For example, Comrade Sun Zuomin said that because peasants in feudal society lacked their own mass organizations, "religious societies have become almost the only possible organizational form." He also believes that the reason why many peasant uprisings developed slowly and took a considerable amount of time is because they lacked 'religion' as an organizational condition. According to his calculations, it took three years for the formation of the Xinshi Pinglin Army, five years for the great uprising at the end of the Sui Dynasty, four years for the great uprising at the end of the Tang Dynasty, and nine years for the great uprising at the end of the Ming Dynasty. After making such calculations, he concluded: "If we examine these uprisings in connection with the Yellow Turban Uprising, it is not difficult to see that these uprisings lacked religion as an organizational condition, so they could not form a national scale in a short period of time with one order, but required a considerable long process of development and growth." (See *Exploration of the Question of Chinese Peasant Wars*, published by New Knowledge Press) In fact, Comrade Sun Zuomin's calculations are flawed, and therefore the conclusion becomes a problem. We once examined these uprisings in connection with the Yellow Turban Uprising according to his proposal. However, after our investigation, we found that the Yellow Turban Uprising, which had religion as an organizational condition, also took more than ten years to prepare before it could rise on the same day in thirty-six directions. Take the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom as an example, which has religion as an organizational condition, but it also took seven or eight years to carry out propaganda, mobilization, and organizational work. How can the speed of development of peasant uprisings be found in religion?

Recently, we also read an article by Comrade Yang Kuan, entitled *On the Role of Revolutionary Thought in Chinese Peasant Wars and Its Relationship with Religion*, some of the arguments in which we cannot agree with. For example, he said: "Under the historical conditions at that time, it was impossible to form any political groups in the countryside, and the existing organizations that could be used were only religious groups. Religion was the only organizational form familiar to peasants at that time, and only through the connection of religious organizations could isolated rural areas and scattered peasants be connected." (See *Academic Monthly*, Issue 7, 1960) We believe that this does not conform to historical facts. As everyone knows, many large-scale peasant uprisings in Chinese history did not utilize religion. For example, the uprising led by Chen Sheng and Wu Guang at the end of the Qin Dynasty, the great peasant uprising at the end of the Western Han Dynasty, the great peasant uprising at the end of the Sui Dynasty, the uprising led by Huang Chao and Wang Xianzhi at the end of the Tang Dynasty, the uprising led by Wang Xiaobo and Li Shun at the beginning of the Northern Song Dynasty, the great uprising of Liu Liu and Liu Qi in the middle of the Ming Dynasty, the uprising led by Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong at the end of the Ming Dynasty, the uprisings held by various secret societies in the south during the Qing Dynasty, and the Nian Army uprising, etc., these large-scale uprisings did not utilize religion. As for other smaller scales, it is impossible to list them one by one.

Many people also believe that combining with religion is a characteristic of Chinese peasant wars, some say it is one of the four characteristics, and some say it is one of the six characteristics. We think this is also worth discussing. The peasant uprisings listed above did not utilize religion. However, the scale was quite large, the organization was quite good, the duration was quite long, and some of the program slogans were quite clear, and they were not inferior to the peasant uprisings of the same era that utilized religion. What's more, some peasant uprisings utilized religion, but the religious color was not very strong, and some peasant uprisings abandoned the religious cloak after the power was gathered. How can we say that combining with religion is a characteristic of Chinese peasant wars? If someone made the opposite conclusion, saying that not combining with religion is a characteristic of Chinese peasant wars, wouldn't they be able to give more reasons and cite more examples? We believe that combining with religion does not constitute a characteristic of Chinese peasant wars. In China's feudal era (here mainly refers to the Han nationality), the spiritual weapon in the hands of the ruling class, the dominant one was Confucianism. No matter which religion, even if it played a very important role in the spiritual field, it never replaced Confucianism and occupied a dominant position. The emperor was the supreme ruler, and no powerful bishop could compete with him, and there was never a pope. Generally speaking, there was neither a so-called state religion, nor was there a situation of the unity of politics and religion. Religious organizations did not penetrate into every corner of society, and religious life did not occupy a considerable important position in the lives of the masses as it did in Europe. After considering this characteristic of Chinese history, it is easier for us to understand why most Chinese peasant wars were not combined with religion.

As everyone knows, the deepest root of peasant uprisings lies in the feudal exploitation system, in the cruel political oppression and economic exploitation of peasants by the landlord class, and is the result of the intensification of class contradictions. Whether a peasant uprising is possible depends entirely on the revolutionary situation at the time. Lenin pointed out three main characteristics of a revolutionary situation in *The Bankruptcy of the Second International*: First, the ruling class cannot maintain its rule unchanged; second, the poverty and disaster of the oppressed class are extraordinarily aggravated; third, due to the above reasons, the activism of the masses is greatly improved. We believe that when this revolutionary situation has arrived, even without the role of religion in organizing and mobilizing, the peasant masses will hold large-scale uprisings. The opposite is also true. If the class contradictions are not very sharp and the time for a peasant uprising is not fully ripe, even with the role of religion in organizing and mobilizing, a peasant uprising will not break out. Because the role of religion is, after all, limited, just as it cannot extinguish the revolutionary flame of the masses, it cannot set off the revolutionary wave of the masses.

IV. What Role Did Religion Play in Peasant Wars?

Religion is created by people, and dogmas are interpreted by people. Different classes create different religions, and different people have different interpretations of dogmas in different eras. In the history of Chinese peasant wars, the peasant class also created its own religion and also made its own interpretation of the religious dogmas of the ruling class. These religions cannot be considered to serve the ruling class, and they played a positive role in peasant wars.

First, it is a way for peasant uprisings to gather strength. For example, the uprising led by Zhang Jiao brothers at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty took advantage of the opportunity to spread the Taiping religion, "sending eight disciples to the four directions to educate the world with kindness," deceiving the eyes and ears of the enemy and uniting a large number of masses. Another example is Hong Xiuquan and Feng Yunshan, the leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, who also took advantage of the opportunity to spread the God Worshipping religion, actively engaged in revolutionary activities in the Zijing Mountain area of ​​Guangxi, established the God Worshipping Society, organized thousands of members, and recruited outstanding heroes such as Yang Xiuqing and Shi Dakai, gathering strength for the armed uprising. Of course, this is only one of the ways to gather strength, and its role is limited to before the outbreak of the uprising. After the armed uprising officially broke out, the masses in various places would respond to the news and come to join, and there was no need to gather these forces through religion. For example, after the Jintian Uprising of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, especially during the expansion of the army in southern Hunan, the Tiandihui masses in various places did not participate in the Taiping Army because they believed in the God Worshipping religion, and it can even be said that when they participated in the Taiping Army, they did not know what the God Worshipping religion was all about.

Second, it is an organizational form for launching armed uprisings. For example, the thirty-six directions of the Yellow Turbans were religious organizations in peacetime, and military organizations during the uprising, and the leader of the religion was also the leader of the uprising army. Other uprisings such as the one led by Fang La, the Jintian Uprising of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and the Yihetuan Movement have similar situations. However, after the outbreak of the armed uprising, especially when the team expands and advances rapidly, the use of religious organizational forms often cannot meet the requirements of this situation, and wise leaders will replace the original religious organizational forms with purely military organizational forms.

Third, religious language has been used as a tool for propaganda and mobilization. For example, putting forward some religious prophecies, declaring that the revolutionary cause is "rising in response to fate" and is blessed by God, to educate everyone to strengthen their fighting confidence. Another example is declaring that everyone worships God, has the same religious beliefs, are brothers and sisters, and should help and love each other, to educate everyone to strengthen internal unity. Another example is declaring that God can see everyone's words and deeds, and violating discipline will be punished by God, to educate everyone to abide by discipline. Sometimes religious language is also used to explain some political programs, such as the so-called "Covering the world is the one family of the Heavenly Father, the Supreme Lord, the Imperial God, everyone in the world is not selfish, everything belongs to the Supreme Lord, then the Lord has a place to use it, the world is equal everywhere, and everyone is full and warm. This is the Heavenly Father, the Supreme Lord, the Imperial God, especially the True Lord of Taiping to save the world."

However, while seeing these positive effects, we should not forget that even the religion utilized by peasant wars is still a superstitious and passive ideology. Its explanations and descriptions of reality are incorrect, and therefore its prophecies and claims cannot stand the test of reality. Those backward, superstitious, and passive factors will inevitably have an impact on peasant wars. Especially in the later period of peasant wars, victory has overwhelmed some people's minds, some weaknesses of the peasant class have begun to rise, and religious superstition will play a role opposite to the past with the occurrence and development of this situation. The positive effects that once occurred will gradually disappear, and the negative effects will grow day by day.

The most obvious example is the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Before the Jintian Uprising, Yang Xiuqing pretended to be the Heavenly Father descending to stabilize the once chaotic situation and strengthen internal unity. But after arriving in Nanjing, the situation was different. The so-called "Heavenly Father Descending" actually became Yang Xiuqing's tool for arbitrary decision-making. He appeared as the spokesperson of the Heavenly Father, angrily rebuking the Heavenly King Hong Xiuquan, and even wanted to beat him forty boards, and even coerced Hong Xiuquan to grant him the title of "Ten Thousand Years," and his arrogance had reached the extreme. From this, it can be seen that it is still the God Worshipping religion, it is still the Heavenly Father descending, the spokesperson is still Yang Xiuqing, but the roles played before and after are completely different. It used to play the role of strengthening unity, but later it played the role of promoting division. Another example is that before the Jintian Uprising, secretly cast weapons were thrown into the Rhinoceros Pond, and then taken out of the pond during the uprising, claiming that it was with the help of God, which played a role in encouraging fighting spirit at that time. Later, under the dangerous situation of the siege of Tianjing, Hong Xiuquan also claimed the help of God. When there was no food to eat, he ordered "the whole city to eat sweet dew, which can nourish life," and when there were no reinforcements, he said "My heavenly soldiers and generals are more than water," unreasonably rejecting Li Xiucheng's proposal of "letting the city go." Religious superstition has made him lose his mind, as Li Xiucheng said: "My Lord does not allow anyone to play, and believes in the spirit of heaven, saying that there is heaven but no people." Hong Xiuquan used to overcome difficulties indomitably, but now he pushes the difficulties to God to solve. From this, it can be seen that it is still the God Worshipping religion, and it is still claiming the help of God, but it used to play the role of encouraging fighting spirit, but later it demoralized people and missed the opportunity. In addition, religion also played some other negative roles in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. For example, the leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom blurred their understanding of foreign aggressors because they had the same religious form, and mistakenly regarded them as friends. Another example is superstition in fate, believing that life, death, wealth, and nobility are all arranged by God, saying that "In short, poverty and wealth are arranged by heaven," and "Small wealth is due to diligence and great wealth is due to fate," and so on. Some comrades said: The God Worshipping religion "has been playing a positive role in the revolution of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." We believe that this conclusion does not conform to historical facts.

V. What is the Relationship Between Peasant Revolutionary Thought and Religious Dogma?

In religious dogmas, we often see many moving words, such as "Taiping" ("Great Peace"), "equality," "heaven," "happy paradise," and so on. For religion, these words are nothing more than an attractive aroma of opium; but for the oppressed laboring people, they are some urgent issues that they long to solve. In order to lure people into fascination, religion raises these desirable issues, but at the same time asks people to strive for solutions in the afterlife through atonement, repentance, and prayer, in order to guide people away from the struggle in reality. However, since "Taiping," "equality," "heaven," and so on have been raised as issues, this will inevitably have an impact on the oppressed people and have some enlightening effects. Therefore, in some peasant wars, we see the situation of borrowing religious dogmas. For example, the Fang La Uprising and the peasant uprising at the end of the Yuan Dynasty borrowed the "two sects and three realms" of "Manichaeism," believing that light will surely defeat darkness, and put forward the prophecy of "Ming King will be born." Another example is the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, which borrowed the Christian dogma that all people are children of God and are equal, and put forward the idea of ​​equality of "The Heavenly Father God is common to all, and the world is one family from ancient times" and "All under heaven are brothers, and God sees them as infants." In this sense, there is some connection between religious dogmas and peasant revolutionary thought. But it cannot be concluded that the program slogans of peasant wars are derived from religious dogmas, or that religious dogmas aroused a storm-like peasant revolution. Everyone knows that religion does not have the ability to call wind and rain, and it is impossible to arouse a revolutionary storm out of thin air.

When talking about this issue, everyone usually likes to cite the example of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Indeed, when Hong Xiuquan founded the God Worshipping religion, he did obtain a missionary book called *Words to Admonish the World* in Guangzhou. This is a pamphlet written in clumsy style, which contains several chapters of the Bible and questions for studying the Bible, as well as several articles expounding the doctrine. Obviously, this pamphlet provides very little religious knowledge to Hong Xiuquan, and some of the content is simply incomprehensible. As for his reading of the Old and New Testaments and gaining more knowledge about Christianity, it was in 1847, which was a later matter. But before 1847, his revolutionary activities had already begun, and his revolutionary thought had basically matured. At this time, he had written three very important articles, namely *Ode to the Origin of the Way to Save the World*, *Instruction on the Origin of the Way to Awaken the World*, and *Teaching on the Origin of the Way to Awaken the World*. In these articles, he put forward the ideas of political equality and economic equality, demanded to change the "world of oppression and killing" into a "world of fairness and justice," and enthusiastically praised the communist society he yearned for. In these three articles, he expounded many important revolutionary ideas, and it can be said that these ideas initially laid the theoretical foundation for the revolutionary movement of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. It can be seen that Hong Xiuquan's revolutionary thought had basically matured when religious knowledge was still very poor. We can even go further and say that when he did not know what Christianity was, he already had lofty revolutionary aspirations. He read *Words to Admonish the World* in 1843, but before that, he had written several anti-poems, the first of which was: "The dragon lurking in the corner of the sea is afraid of shocking the sky, temporarily steal leisure to leap in the abyss; waiting for the wind and clouds to gather together, flying six harmonies will determine the world." Another poem began with two lines: "Holding the power of killing in the universe, cutting down evil and leaving righteousness to solve the people's suffering." There is also a poem entitled Ode to the Sword, which says: "Holding three feet to set the mountains and rivers, the world is one family to drink together, capturing all the demons and returning to the earth net, collecting the remnants and traitors to fall into the sky, the southeast and northwest Dun Huangji, the sun, moon and stars play the victory song, the tiger roars and the dragon chants light the world, how happy is the Taiping unification!" In this poem, the ideas of "the world is one family" and "Taiping unification" have been put forward. It can be affirmed that when Hong Xiuquan did not know what Christianity was, he already had a clearer revolutionary thought.

Comrade Yang Kuan said in his article *On the Taiping Jing* that due to the limitations of historical conditions, the "revolutionary theory of the peasants had to put on the cloak of religion." (See *Academic Weekly*, Issue 9, 1959) Recently, it was also said at a discussion in Shanghai: "The peasants in feudal society could not be atheists, and all revolutionary theories must be cloaked in religion on the basis of the peasants' own interests, and there is no other way." (See *Academic Monthly*, Issue 8, 1960) We do not deny that in feudal society, God is a very authoritative thing, and religious language is a magical language. Therefore, some peasant uprisings, in their programs and slogans, relied on the authority of God to strengthen its appeal, or used religious language to express their revolutionary thoughts. This situation is understandable. However, it must not be considered a universal situation, it cannot be considered that "all revolutionary theories" of the peasant class must be so, and it is not as Yang Kuan said, "there is no other way."

We still take the examples in Chinese history. When Wang Xiaobo launched the uprising, he put forward the slogan "I hate the inequality between the rich and the poor, and now I will equalize it for you," which is a purely political slogan and does not have any religious color. Another example is the slogans put forward by Li Zicheng during the uprising, such as "equal land distribution and tax exemption" and "equal buying and selling," and the slogan "three years of tax exemption" put forward by Zhang Xianzhong, all of which did not put on any religious cloak. Another example is the uprising led by Li Wenxue in the Ailao Mountain area of ​​Yunnan during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom period, which put forward the program slogans such as "eradicate the Manchu Qing corrupt officials and kill all the Han landlords" and "the land of the landlords originally cultivated by the common people shall belong to all the common people," and did not find any religious basis or put on any religious cloak. Even like the uprising led by Zhong Xiang and Yang Mo, although they had utilized religion, the slogan "equalize the nobility and equalize the poor and the rich" that they put forward was a purely political slogan and was not linked to any religious dogma. Although the Fang La Uprising had utilized religion, his eloquent speech full of appeal talked about revolutionary principles throughout the article and did not have a bit of religious atmosphere. Even like the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, which had a relatively strong religious color, its main program, such as the Heavenly Dynasty Land System, in addition to the words Heavenly Father, Supreme Lord, Imperial God, etc., there was not much based on religious dogma or put on a religious cloak. The reason is very simple, because no religious dogma has ever had the idea of ​​distributing the land of the world to the peasants. Therefore, Comrade Yang Kuan said: "Chinese peasant wars are developed by connecting peasant revolutionary thought with religion." (See *The Shanghai Historical Circle Discusses the Relationship Between Chinese Peasant Wars and Religion*, *People's Daily*, August 25, 1960) We express doubt about this conclusion.

The relationship between Chinese peasant wars and religion is a rather complicated issue that needs to be further explored. This article puts forward some preliminary views, please correct them.

    试论中国农民战争和宗教的关系
    戎笙　龙盛运　何龄修
    编者按：关于中国封建时代农民战争和宗教的关系，是目前我国史学界正在讨论的一个问题。这篇文章就这个问题提出了商讨的意见，现在把它发表出来供读者参考。
    一、如何理解宗教是“人民的鸦片”？
    宗教是一种社会意识形态，它是客观世界在人们头脑中的反映，不过不是真实的科学的反映。宗教不是按照世界本来的样子去认识世界，而是歪曲地颠倒地错误地反映客观世界。所以说：宗教是“颠倒了的世界观”。按照宗教的观点看来，自然的风雨雷电，人类的死生祸福，都是由一种神秘莫测的超自然的力量主宰着。因此，人们在自然界或社会的自发势力面前是无能为力的，只能听从超自然的力量任意摆布。宗教对自然的灾害和社会的不平，都采取一种消极的态度，它妨碍人们正确地认识世界，也妨碍人们积极地去改造世界。由于宗教具有这种特性，所以在阶级对抗的社会里，它获得了新的生命力，受到反动统治阶级的支持和利用，而成为统治人民的一种精神武器。
    在阶级社会里，所有一切反动的统治阶级，为了维护自己的统治，都需要两种社会职能：一种是刽子手的职能，一种是传教士的职能。前者用武力镇压被压迫阶级的反抗，后者则用宗教麻痹群众的革命斗志。为剥削阶级服务的宗教，尽管五花八门，千变万化，但都有个共同的特点，就是宣扬阶级和平，为现存的统治秩序作辩护，教导人民对待压迫者应该温柔恭顺，对待自己的贫困和苦难应该忍气吞声。差不多所有的宗教，都为劳动者的“来世”虚构了一个“幸福的乐园”，为的是叫他们毫无怨言地忍受今生的剥削和压迫。宗教就是通过这些宣传，来毒害群众的革命意识，败坏他们的革命热情，从而使他们放弃革命斗争，让剥削者和压迫者安然地进行统治。所以说，宗教是精神压迫的一种，是麻醉人民的鸦片。
    在中国历史上，也有过各种各样的宗教，其中影响较大的要算道教、佛教和基督教。
    道教是在中国土生土长的宗教。它的第一部经典——《太平经》，就是为剥削阶级服务的。它把人类社会的尊卑贵贱等级制度，说成是一种铁定不移的自然之道，是神的安排，不是人力所能改变的。它竭力为人剥削人的制度作辩护，说农民之生产五谷，奴婢之生产财货，都是皇天的安排，任何人不得违反。为了使被压迫者永远安于穷困悲惨的命运，它又大量宣传安贫乐贱的思想。它说：“安贫乐贱可长久，贱反求贵道相妨。”还说：“凡民奴婢皆顺善不为邪恶，是乃天地大喜之征也”。《太平经》中的这些思想，可以说基本上奠定了道教教义的基础。不管后来经历了多少次改朝换代，它的基本思想没有发生过本质的变化。我们再看看《云笈七签》，它是在八九个世纪以后编修的，教义当然有了很多演变，但其中的毒素却可以说万变未离其宗。它说贫穷是由命里注定了的，“既不可逃，又不可怨，唯有智者，因而善之，乐天知命，不觉贫之可苦”。其中载有许多戒律，如“戒勿厌贫贱，强求富贵”；“不得叛逆君王，谋害家国”等等。另外还有许多规劝，例如在讲到所谓“崇百药”的时候，有什么“虽憎犹爱是一药”，“逢侵不鄙是一药”，“受辱不怒是一药”，“安贫不怨是一药”等等。用不着多加分析，这种说教的反动作用是十分明显的。
    有趣的是，产生在几千公里之外的基督教，和道教的腔调竟有异曲同工之妙。基督教虽然产生于下层群众之中，但它被宣布成为罗马帝国的国教之后，便通过各种各样的说教为剥削制度作辩护，宣扬阶级存在的必要性，赞美怯懦、自卑、温柔、屈从、恭顺。对待敌人不仅不应该反抗，还应该爱他，为他祝福，为他祈祷。如路加福音第六章说：“只是我告诉你们这听道的人，你们的仇敌要爱他，恨你们的要待他好，咒诅你们的要为他祝福，凌辱你们的要为他祷告。”这还不够，它更进一步教导人们说：有人打你的右脸，连左脸也转过去由他打；有人想夺你的外衣，连内衣也让他拿去。并且所有这些，都被宣布为上帝的意旨。事情很明显，如果劳动者都按照上帝的意志办事的话，那就没有了群众的反抗运动，没有了群众的革命战争。
    不过宗教的作用，毕竟是有限的。尽管它极力宣扬阶级调和，但是阶级矛盾是不可调和的；尽管它教导劳动者要顺从和忍耐，但是被压迫者在残酷的剥削和压迫之下，是不肯顺从，也是无法忍耐的。他们举行了大小千百次的起义，以反抗这种剥削和压迫。可见，宗教虽然毒害过群众的意识，影响过群众的斗争，但终究动摇不了群众的革命决心，扑灭不了群众的革命火焰。
    二、农民战争所利用的宗教有何特点？
    广大劳动群众不仅突破宗教思想的束缚，举行过无数次大规模的起义，并且在起义过程中，有时还利用了宗教。这种利用之所以可能，一方面是由于农民并不是无神论者，他们信仰神、崇拜超自然的力量；另一方面也是由于宗教思想具有某些可以利用的因素。大家知道，宗教毒害群众的意识，是采取欺骗愚弄的形式，因而往往要在它的毒素外面，裹上一层诱人的糖衣。如果就这个糖衣来说，它不外是主张平等，崇尚光明，向往天堂幸福等等。不用说，这些思想是很容易和当时群众的革命要求结合起来的。比如，宗教宣传在天国一律平等，农民阶级却利用它来争取人世间的平等；宗教虚伪地宣扬崇尚光明正直反对黑暗邪恶，农民阶级却利用它来阐发争取幸福反对压迫和剥削的革命思想；宗教用“天国”来安慰被压迫者，农民阶级却利用它来唤起对于美好未来的憧憬；宗教维护现存统治秩序宣扬君权神授，农民阶级为了夺取政权也宣称自己受命于天。在中国历史上，一部分农民战争是利用过宗教的。如东汉末年的黄巾大起义曾利用过道教，北宋末方腊起义曾利用过摩尼教，元末韩山童、刘福通领导的起义曾利用过白莲教，近代的太平天国曾利用过基督教，义和团也曾利用过白莲教。就中国的历史来看，农民战争中利用宗教，不外乎下述两种情形。一种是把为统治阶级服务而在民间流传的宗教加以革新，创造出适合自己需要而和统治阶级的宗教有所不同的新教；另一种是利用为统治阶级严令禁止而在民间秘密流传的宗教。这些宗教在农民战争过程中，成为组织群众和动员群众的一种工具，起了一定的积极作用。
    这些宗教之所以在农民战争中起积极的作用，是因为它不同于统治阶级的宗教，具有如下许多新的特点。
    第一、它具有强烈的斗争性，这特别明显地表现在对“太平”一语的解释上。统治阶级的宗教往往把“太平”二字解释成“三阶正曰太平”，“景星现曰太平”，或者是“六合同风，万邦共轨，君明物庶”之类。再不就是像《云笈七签》所引《太平经》钞甲部的话：“澄清大乱，功高德正，故号太平。”可是在农民阶级所创造的宗教教义里，对“太平”二字便有不同的解释。如元末民间流传的一首扶箕诗，其中有两句说道：“不平人杀不平者，杀尽不平方太平。”再如拜上帝教的《太平救世歌》中说：“扫灭妖魔，天下太平。”又说：“伫见妖魔速灭，天下肃菁，江山一统，万古太平。”这种解释，就不带有阶级调和的色彩，而具有强烈的斗争气息。此外，如明教教义宣扬“明”与“暗”的斗争，认为在斗争的第二阶段，光明就会战胜黑暗。再如拜上帝教，它虽然是利用了基督教而创立的，但它没有基督教那种爱敌人的教义；恰恰相反，它把人间的压迫者剥削者概括地称之为阎罗妖，并指出这个阎罗妖是“天下凡间我们兄弟姊妹所当共击灭之惟恐不速者也”。
    第二、这些宗教不是为现存的统治秩序作辩护，而是为农民阶级的革命事业作辩护。例如，东汉末年的太平教就是宣称“苍天已死，黄天当立，岁在甲子，天下大吉”。刘福通领导的反元大起义，就用“弥勒佛降生，明王出世”来证明自己的行动受命于天。拜上帝教就宣传上帝曾赠给洪秀全一部天书，一口宝剑，一方大印，令他斩尽人间的妖魔鬼怪。义和团的碑文中则有“神助拳，义和团，只因鬼子闹中原……神爷怒，仙爷烦，伊等下山把道传。”乩语中有“一片苦海望无津，小神忙乱走风尘，八千十万兵神起，扫灭洋人世界新”。
    第三、由于这些宗教具有强烈的斗争性，为农民阶级的革命事业作辩护，所以它不为当时的统治阶级所允许，而被诬蔑为“妖教”、“邪教”、“旁门左道”、“教匪”，并受到残酷的武力镇压。因此，凡是为农民战争所利用的宗教，差不多都是采取秘密活动的方式。
    第四、这些宗教一方面宣传对敌人要进行坚决斗争，另一方面对内部却提倡互助团结友爱。如东汉末年的太平教，宋代的明教，明、清的白莲教，太平天国的拜上帝教，都有这种情形。
    第五、这些宗教一般都带有禁欲主义色彩，如薄葬、素食、不饮酒、不近女色等等。这种摈弃一切人生享乐的要求，对于农民战争是有积极作用的。关于这一点，恩格斯在《德国农民战争》一书中已有过明确的指示。如果就表面现象上看，统治阶级的宗教也有素食、节用、禁酒、戒色等等主张，不过那是愚弄人的一种把戏，说什么在今世生活愈苦，在来世就会有最美好的生活。这种宗教思想的社会作用是反动的。
    三、农民战争是否必须和宗教相结合？
    有不少人认为，宗教为农民战争所必需。比如，孙祚民同志说：由于封建社会里农民缺乏自己的群众性的组织，“宗教会门，便几乎成为唯一可能的组织形式了”。他还认为，许多次农民起义之所以发展缓慢，需要相当长的时间，是因为缺乏‘宗教’作为组织条件。按照他的计算，新市平林军的形成用了三年，隋末大起义用了五年，唐末大起义用了四年，明末大起义用了九年。他在作了这样的计算之后，便作出结论说：“如果把这些起义和黄巾大起义联系起来考察一下的话，不难看出，这些起义都是缺乏宗教作为组织条件，所以不能够一声令下，就在很短期间内形成全国性规模，而需要一段相当长的发展与壮大过程了。”（见《中国农民战争问题探索》，新知识出版社出版）其实，孙祚民同志的计算是有毛病的，因而结论便成了问题。我们曾按照他的提议，把这些起义和黄巾大起义联系起来考察。可是，我们在考察之后发现，有宗教作为组织条件的黄巾大起义，也费去了十余年的时间进行准备，才得以三十六方同日而起。就拿太平天国来说，它是有宗教作为组织条件的，但也费去了七八年的时间进行宣传动员和组织工作。农民起义发展速度的快慢，怎么能到宗教里去寻找根源呢？
    最近我们又读到了杨宽同志的一篇文章，题目叫做《论中国农民战争中革命思想的作用及其与宗教的关系》，其中有些论点是我们所不能同意的。比如他说：“在当时的历史条件下，在农村中不可能组成任何政治团体，可以利用的现存的组织只有宗教团体。宗教是当时农民唯一熟悉的组织形式，也只有通过宗教组织的联系，才可以使各个孤立的农村和分散的农民联结起来。”（见《学术月刊》，1960年第七期）我们认为这和历史事实不符。大家知道，在中国历史上，许多次大规模农民起义都没有利用宗教。如秦末陈胜、吴广领导的起义，西汉末年的农民大起义，隋末农民大起义，唐末黄巢、王仙芝领导的起义、北宋初王小波、李顺领导的起义，明朝中叶刘六、刘七大起义，明末李自成、张献忠领导的起义，清代南方各种秘密结社举行的起义，以及捻军起义等等，这些大规模的起义都没有利用过宗教。至于其他规模较小的，那就无法一一列举了。
    也有不少人认为，和宗教相结合是中国农民战争的特点，有的说是四个特点之一，有的说是六个特点之一。我们觉得这也是值得商榷的。像上面列举的那些农民起义，都没有利用过宗教。可是规模都相当的大，组织相当的好，持续时间相当的久，有些纲领口号也相当明确，和同时代的利用过宗教的农民起义相比并不逊色。何况有些农民起义虽然利用了宗教，但宗教色彩并不很浓，又有些农民起义在力量聚集起来之后，就摈弃了宗教外衣。怎么能够说和宗教相结合是中国农民战争的特点呢？假如有人作出相反的结论，说不和宗教相结合是中国农民战争的特点，岂不是还可以说出更多的理由，举出更多的例证吗？我们认为，和宗教相结合并不构成中国农民战争的特点。在中国的封建时代里（这里主要就汉族而言），统治阶级手中的精神武器，占支配地位的是儒家思想。无论是哪一种宗教，即使在精神领域中起过很重要的作用，但始终没有取代儒家思想而占支配地位。皇帝是至高无上的统治者，没有一个有权力的主教可以和他分庭抗礼，更不曾有过什么教皇。一般地说，既没有所谓国教，也不曾出现过政教合一的局面。宗教组织并没有深入到社会的各个角落，宗教生活也不像欧洲那样在群众生活中占着相当重要的地位。我们在考虑到中国历史的这个特点之后，就比较容易理解，为什么中国农民战争大部分都没有与宗教相结合。
    大家知道，农民起义的最深刻的根源，在于封建主义的剥削制度，在于地主阶级对于农民残酷的政治压迫和经济剥削，是阶级矛盾尖锐化的结果。农民起义是否可能爆发，完全取决于当时的革命形势。列宁在《第二国际的破产》中曾指出革命形势的三个主要特征：第一是统治阶级不可能照旧不变地维持自己的统治，第二是被压迫阶级的贫困和灾难超乎寻常的加剧，第三是由于上述的原因，群众的积极性大大提高。我们认为，当这种革命形势已经到来的情况下，即使没有宗教起组织和动员的作用，农民群众也会大规模地举行起义。反之也是一样。如果阶级矛盾还不是十分尖锐，农民起义的时机还没有完全成熟，即使有宗教起组织和动员的作用，农民起义也不会爆发。因为宗教的作用，毕竟是有限的，正如它扑灭不了群众的革命火焰一样，也掀起不了群众的革命浪潮。
    四、宗教在农民战争中起了什么作用？
    宗教是由人创造的，教义是由人去解释的。不同的阶级会创造出不同的宗教，不同的人在不同的时代对教义会有不同的解释。在中国农民战争史上，农民阶级也曾创立过自己的宗教，也曾对统治阶级的宗教教义作过自己的解释。这些宗教便不能认为是为统治阶级服务的，它在农民战争中起过积极的作用。
    第一、它是农民起义聚集力量的一种方式。如东汉末年张角兄弟领导的起义，就是利用传播太平教的机会，“遣弟子八人，使于四方，以善道教化天下”，骗过了敌人的耳目，团聚了大批群众。再如太平天国的领导者洪秀全、冯云山，也是利用传播拜上帝教的机会，在广西紫荆山地区积极从事革命活动，成立拜上帝会，组织了几千名会员，并物色了杨秀清、石达开等杰出的英雄人物，为武装起义聚集了力量。当然，这只是聚集力量的方式之一，而且它的作用只限于在起义爆发之前。当武装起义正式爆发之后，各地群众便会闻风响应，纷纷前来汇合，而不需要通过宗教把这些力量聚集起来。像太平天国在金田起义之后、特别是在湘南扩军的时候，各地天地会群众并不是因为信仰拜上帝教而来参加太平军的，甚至可以说当他们参加太平军的时候，他们还根本不知道拜上帝教是怎么一回事。
    第二、它是发动武装起义的一种组织形式。如黄巾的三十六方，平时是宗教性的组织，起义时就是军事性的组织，教主也就是起义军的领袖。其他如方腊领导的起义，太平天国金田起义，义和团运动等，都有类似的情形。不过，在武装起义爆发之后，特别是在队伍扩大、进军神速的情况下，利用宗教的组织形式，往往不能适应这种形势的要求，明智的领导者就会用纯粹军事性的组织去代替原先的宗教性的组织形式。
    第三、宗教语言曾被用作进行宣传鼓动的一种工具。比如提出某种宗教性的预言，宣称革命事业是“应运而兴”，得到神的庇佑，通过这来教育大家加强斗争信心。又如宣称大家同拜上帝，宗教信仰相同，都是兄弟姊妹，应该互助友爱，借此来教育大家加强内部团结。再如宣称上帝能洞察每一个人的言行，违背纪律会受到上帝惩罚，借此来教育大家要遵守纪律。有时也用宗教语言来解释部分政治纲领，如天朝田亩制度有所谓“盖天下皆是天父上主皇上帝一大家，天下人人不受私，物物归上主，则主有所运用，天下大家处处平匀，人人饱暖矣。此乃天父上主皇上帝特命太平真主救世旨意也”。
    但是，在看到这些积极作用的同时，也不应该忘记，即令是农民战争所利用的宗教，毕竟还是一种迷信的消极的意识形态。它对于现实的解释和说明是不正确的，因而它的预言和假托都经不起现实的考验。它那些落后的迷信的消极的因素，不会不在农民战争中发生影响。特别是在农民战争后期，胜利已冲昏了一部分人的头脑，农民阶级的某些弱点已开始抬头，宗教迷信就会随着这种情况的发生和发展，起着和过去相反的作用。原先曾经发生过的积极作用就会逐渐消失，消极的作用就会日益滋长。
    最明显的例子是太平天国。在金田起义之前，杨秀清曾假托天父下凡，把当时一度混乱的局面稳定下来，加强了内部的团结。可是到了南京之后，情况就不同了。所谓“天父下凡”，实际上成为杨秀清手中独断专行的工具。他以天父代言人的身分出现，怒责天王洪秀全，还要打他四十大板，甚至要挟洪秀全封他为“万岁”，跋扈已到了极点。从此可以看出，依然是拜上帝教，依然是天父下凡，代言人依然还是杨秀清，可是前后所起的作用就完全不同。从前起了加强团结的作用，后来却起了助长分裂的作用。再如金田起义之前，把秘密铸造的武器投入犀牛潭，起义时再从潭中取出，托言是得到神的帮助，这在当时起了鼓舞斗志的作用。后来在天京被围的危急情况之下，洪秀全也是托言神的帮助。在没有粮吃的时候，他下令“合城俱食甘露，可以养生”，在没有援兵的时候，他却说“朕之天兵天将多过于水”，无理地拒绝了李秀成提出的“让城别走”的建议。宗教迷信已使他丧失了理智，正如李秀成所说：“我主格外不由人奏，俱信天灵，诏言有天不有人也”。洪秀全从前碰到困难是百折不挠地去克服它，现在碰到困难却推给上帝去解决。从此可以看出，依然是拜上帝教，依然是托言神的帮助，可是从前曾起了鼓舞斗志的作用，后来却是涣散了人心，坐误了戎机。此外，宗教在太平天国中还起其他一些消极作用。比如，太平天国的领袖们曾因宗教形式相同而模糊了对外国侵略者的认识，误把他们看成是朋友。再如迷信天命，认为死生富贵，都是由上帝安排定的，说什么“总之贫富天排定”，“小富由勤大富命”等等。有的同志说：拜上帝教“在太平天国革命中是一直起着积极作用的”。我们认为这个论断是不合历史事实的。
    五、农民革命思想和宗教教义的关系如何？
    在宗教的教义里，常常看到许多动人的字眼，如“太平”、“平等”、“天国”、“幸福的乐园”等等。这些字眼对于宗教来说，不过是鸦片烟的一阵诱人的芳香；可是对于被压迫的劳动人民来说，却是一些渴望解决的迫切问题。宗教为了引人入迷提出了这些令人向往的问题，同时却叫人们用赎罪、忏悔、祈祷等方式，争取在来世获得解决，以引导人民脱离现实的斗争。不过，“太平”、“平等”、“天国”等等既然被当作问题提出来了，这就不会不在被压迫人民中产生影响，发生某些启示的作用。因此，我们在一部分农民战争中，便看到有借用宗教教义的情形。如方腊起义、元末农民起义就借用“摩尼教”的“二宗三际”之说，认为光明一定会战胜黑暗，提出“明王出世”的预言。再如太平天国，借用了基督教中关于世人皆上帝子女一律平等的教义，而提出了“天父上帝人人共，天下一家自古传”和“普天之下皆兄弟，上帝视之皆赤子”的平等思想。从这个意义上说，宗教教义和农民革命思想是有某种联系的。但不能由此得出结论说，农民战争的纲领口号是由宗教教义引申出来的，或者说宗教教义激起了暴风雨般的农民革命。谁都知道，宗教并没有那种呼风唤雨的本领，不可能凭空唤起一阵革命的暴风雨来。
    在谈到这个问题的时候，大家通常喜欢援引太平天国的例子。诚然，洪秀全在创立拜上帝教的时候，确实在广州得到过一部名叫《劝世良言》的传道书。这是一部用拙劣的文体写出来的小册子，其中刊载了几章圣经和研究圣经的题目以及发挥教理的论文若干篇。显然，这部小册子提供给洪秀全的宗教知识是十分贫乏的，何况有些内容还根本看不懂。至于他阅读新旧约全书，获得较多的关于基督教的知识，是在1847年，那还是后来的事。可是在1847年以前，他的革命活动早已开始，他的革命思想也已基本成熟。他在这时已写出了三篇很重要的文章，即《原道救世歌》、《原道醒世训》、《原道觉世训》。其中提出了政治上平等、经济上平等的思想，要求变“陵夺斗杀之世”为“公平正直之世”，并热情地歌颂了他所向往的大同社会。在这三篇文章里，他阐发了许多重要的革命思想，可以说这些思想初步奠定了太平天国革命运动的理论基础。可见洪秀全是在宗教知识还十分贫乏的时候，革命思想就已基本成熟。甚至我们还可以进一步说，当他还不知道基督教为何物的时候，他就已经有了远大的革命抱负。他阅读《劝世良言》是在1843年，可是在这之前他就题过几首反诗，最先一首是：“龙潜海角恐惊天，暂且偷闲跃在渊；等待风云齐聚会，飞腾六合定乾坤。”另一首劈头两句写道：“手握乾坤杀伐权，斩邪留正解民悬”。还有一首题名为咏宝剑，诗曰：“手持三尺定山河，四海为家共饮和，擒尽妖邪归地网，收残奸宄落天罗，东南西北敦皇极，日月星辰奏凯歌，虎啸龙吟光世界，太平一统乐如何！”在这首诗里，已提出了“四海为家”、“太平一统”的思想。由此可以肯定，在洪秀全还不知道基督教为何物的时候，他就已经有了比较明确的革命思想了。
    杨宽同志在《论太平经》一文中说，由于历史条件的限制，农民的“革命理论也不得不穿上宗教的外衣”。（见《学术周刊》，1959年第九期）最近在上海的一次讨论会上也说：“封建社会的农民不可能是无神论者，所有革命的理论，必然是在农民切身利益上披上宗教外衣的，不可能有其它办法。”（见《学术月刊》，1960年第八期）我们并不否认，在封建社会里，神是一种很有权威的东西，而宗教语言又是一种富有魔力的语言。因此，便有一部分农民起义，在他们的纲领和口号中，借重了神的权威以加强它的号召力，或者是运用了宗教语言来表述他们的革命思想。这种情况原是可以理解的。不过，绝不能认为这是一种普遍的情况，不能认为农民阶级的“所有的革命理论”都必然如此，更不是像杨宽所说的那样，“不可能有其它办法”。
    我们还是举中国历史上的例子来说。王小波起义时提出了“吾疾贫富不均，今为汝均之”的口号，这是一个纯粹政治性的口号，不带有任何宗教色彩。又如李自成起义时提出的“均田免赋”、“平买平卖”等口号，张献忠提出的“三年免征”等口号，也都没有披上任何宗教外衣。再如太平天国时期，云南哀牢山区李文学领导的起义，提出“铲尽满清赃官，杀绝汉家庄主”和“庶民原耕庄主之地，悉归庶民所有”等纲领口号，也没有找什么宗教根据，披什么宗教外衣。即使是像钟相、杨么领导的起义，虽然利用过宗教，但他们提出的“等贵贱、均贫富”的口号，却是个纯粹政治性的口号，并不和任何宗教教义相联结。方腊起义虽然利用过宗教，但他那篇富有号召力的演说，通篇讲的是革命道理，没有一点宗教气息。即使像太平天国，宗教色彩比较浓厚，但它的主要纲领如天朝田亩制度，除了天父上主皇上帝等字眼外，也没有多少是根据宗教教义或披上宗教外衣的。道理很简单，因为没有一个宗教的教义，有过把天下土地分给农民的思想。因此，杨宽同志说：“中国农民战争是农民革命思想与宗教相联结而发展起来的。”（见《上海历史学界讨论关于中国农民战争与宗教的关系问题》，人民日报1960年8月25日）这个结论我们表示怀疑。
    中国农民战争和宗教的关系，是一个相当复杂的问题，需要进一步地探讨。本文提出一些初步看法，请大家指正。
