    The portrayal of Deng Shichang in "The Sino-Japanese War at Sea 1894-1895" as a moving figure is a great victory and success.
    Chairman Mao wrote about Lu Xun:
    “Lu Xun's bones were the hardest; he had not a trace of slavishness or obsequiousness. This is the most precious characteristic of the people in colonies and semi-colonies. Lu Xun was a national hero, unprecedented in history, who represented the vast majority of the nation on the cultural front, charging forward against the enemy most correctly, bravely, resolutely, faithfully and enthusiastically.”
    Of course, Deng Shichang cannot be compared to Lu Xun. Deng Shichang was not a communist, nor was he a thorough democrat. However, in his courage to fight against national enemies and in his adherence to national integrity, he was a man of strong character.
    It should be said that shaping a fine image of a man of strong character has its tremendous practical and educational significance today.
    This is because we have two hundred million people in Africa, two hundred million people in Latin America, and eight hundred million people in Asia, a total of twelve hundred million people, who are engaged in national democratic revolutionary struggles against imperialism and its lackeys;
    This is because there are people, including the aforementioned twelve hundred million, who are engaged in people's revolutionary struggles;
    This is because revisionist thought still exists within the Communist Party and the working class.
    Imperialists habitually use two sets of tactics against revolution, against the people, and against oppressed nations: one is to suppress them with force, and the other is to deceive them with soft words. The former can lead to the emergence of soft-shelled turtles who yield to the pressure of the imperialists; the latter can lead to the emergence of slavish thoughts who are grateful for the petty favors of the imperialists.
    Thus, heroes who are courageous in struggle, never yield, uphold the truth, and uphold justice are particularly valuable and have a particularly moving power. Without such men of strong character, men of iron will, the nation will have no chance to turn over, and the people will have no chance to turn over!
    Deng Shichang was faced with two paths: to submit to the imperialists and to the surrender faction, and he could immediately obtain high office and great wealth; to fight against the imperialists and the surrender faction, and he risked losing his official hat and his head. What a Deng Shichang! In order to uphold justice and national integrity, he put personal gains and losses, life and death, out of his mind.
    In the fourth act, Deng Shichang's dialogues are indeed brilliant, and Deng Shichang's spiritual realm is portrayed exceptionally fully.
    "Fukushima (disguised as a U.S. consular staff member, Ropier): Yes! If the Beiyang Fleet makes any rash moves again, coming out to cause trouble, the Japanese will say that China is wantonly provoking them, and it will be difficult for us 'neutral countries' to speak!
    Deng Shichang: Nonsense! Is it a rash move for the Chinese to defend their own country? Is it causing trouble for the Beiyang Fleet to go out to sea to resist the aggression of the Japanese pirates? Is it that the Japanese devils' despicable sneak attack without a declaration of war is China wantonly provoking? Are we only allowed to be slaughtered and sit and wait for death, so that you can speak well? It's simply turning black and white upside down, utter nonsense!"
    Sharp words and quick retorts, delightful and incisive! Deng Shichang upheld justice, adhered to his position, spoke the words that millions wanted to say, and gave the aggressors a heavy blow!
    The problem is not just with Fukushima. The problem is that Deng Shichang's tit-for-tat struggle with Fukushima was in an environment where Li Hongzhang was engrossed in international mediation. This comprador bureaucrat was in close contact with the envoys of the powers. These words of Deng Shichang, when they reached Li Hongzhang's ears, were no small matter. If Deng Shichang had not a bit of backbone, a bit of courage, he would never have dared to say them.
    Fukushima said, "I don't mind, but now that Mr. Li Hongzhang is advocating international mediation, I think a naval officer should not use such激烈的言词 to破坏和谈的气氛." This was certainly a threat to Deng Shichang, but it was also the truth. The charge of "破坏和谈" being placed on Deng Shichang was entirely possible. And indeed, it was placed on him, and he was dismissed from his post. Only because of Ding Ruchang's guarantee was he reinstated.
    Deng Shichang harbored great resentment towards Li Hongzhang's traitorous behavior. He said to Ding Ruchang, "The Grand Secretary is harming the country and the people!" He was similarly "outspoken" to Empress Dowager Cixi: "Forgive my bluntness, your subject, but when the great enemy is at hand, the naval funds are not used to prepare military supplies and provisions, but are used to build the Longevity Mountain and the Summer Palace, adding pagodas, lake views, colorful pavilions, and opera stages, this is simply..." He pointed out Fang Renqi's ugly soul in one sentence: "You have no backbone in front of foreigners!"
    In this play, on one hand, Li Hongzhang, who does not appear, is conducting traitorous activities behind the scenes between glasses of wine; on the other hand, patriots and aggressors, the forces of justice and the forces of injustice, are engaged in a tit-for-tat struggle. Although the aggressors and traitors, when added together, seem to have the upper hand on the surface, Deng Shichang's shining patriotic thought shows a divine power of righteousness prevailing over evil!
    Deng Shichang exposed Fang Renqi's treason and betrayal of the enemy in front of Li Hongzhang. The one directly exposed was Fang Renqi, but at the same time, the British imperialists, the American imperialists, the Japanese imperialists, and Li Hongzhang, this whole group of ugly characters, were stripped of their masks one by one.
    Fukushima is a spy, Fang Renqi is a traitor, the evidence is clear, no need to say more. The Americans were forced to take off their "fair" mask and openly defend Fukushima. The British and Americans can argue over who to do business with, but when it comes to treating China as meat on the chopping block, they are united.
    Baden said: "...Mr. Ropier is suspected of a crime and should indeed be investigated. However, during the Sino-Japanese dispute, the Japanese residents in China have been entrusted to the American minister to manage. I think Mr. Ropier should be handed over to the American minister as a guilty Japanese resident." These are a few ordinary words, but they are well-portrayed and accurately reflect the nature of the old fox of British imperialism. It shelters the Japanese and Americans, and also builds a ladder for Li Hongzhang's resignation. The so-called should be investigated is nothing more than not investigating under the "extraterritoriality," and there is no way to investigate. Li Hongzhang received the face of "should be investigated" in front of many Chinese and foreigners, while the Japanese and Americans received the practical benefit of not being investigated. Chinese and foreign reactionaries are "all happy"!
    What exactly Fukushima and Fang Renqi are, Li Hongzhang naturally knows in his heart, but he cannot investigate further, nor does he dare to investigate further, because the investigation is likely to lead to his own head. So he had to turn big things into small things, and small things into nothing.
    Compared to Li Hongzhang's presence in front of Baden, Hantoln, Fukushima, and Fang Renqi, this group of demons and monsters, the black and white are clear, and Deng Shichang appears particularly tall.
    One wave is not yet settled, and another wave rises again. The seventh act reached the climax of the peak. Deng Shichang was so brave, resourceful, determined, and loyal, demonstrating from many aspects the spiritual realm of a patriot.
    Deng Shichang had the following dialogue with Qiu Shaolong:
    "Qiu: Captain, the Naval Commissioner is not on our ship, how can we raise the admiral's flag at will?
    Deng: The Naval Commissioner is not on our ship, but without the admiral's flag, there is no command. Haven't you seen that the fleet has already begun to be in chaos? Raise it!
    Qiu: Captain Deng, raising the admiral's flag without authorization is usurping the warship!
    Deng: What did you say!!
    Qiu: Captain, if we raise the admiral's flag, the Japanese warships will concentrate their fire on us!
    Deng: First Mate, we are going to divert the enemy's fire, so that the Naval Commissioner's ship can break through the encirclement, raise it quickly!..."
    One is considering personal safety, desires such as power and position; the other is considering: attracting danger to one's own head. At a critical moment, he will not give way, and for the benefit of the country and the nation, he will do everything possible to win the victory of the war.
    The more critical the moment, the more it can test the quality of a person. Who is a gentleman? Who is a villain? Who is pure gold? Who is a fake? As clear as black and white. Deng Shichang is a gentleman, Deng Shichang is pure gold!
    Finally, Deng Shichang heroically sacrificed himself in the process of speeding up to ram the enemy warship.
    The Zhiyuan sank, and Deng Shichang's body also sank. However, the spirit of patriotism, the revolutionary backbone of a Chinese, was thus reborn and became forever youthful!
    True, the ending is a tragedy. However, from this tragedy comes a positive force. We see now, and our children and grandchildren will always see: national heroes like Captain Deng and Captain Lin, who are righteous and awe-inspiring, are models for society, the backbone of the nation, and they will forever live in the hearts of the people!
    Before the Zhiyuan accelerated its speed to strike the enemy warship, the solemn and solemn ranks of sailors on the deck, Deng Shichang's gaze facing the statue in front, is a bugle call for our advance, an encouragement for battle!
    Where does Deng Shichang's courage come from?
    The tradition of patriotism and preliminary democratic thought is a force supporting him;
    He is relatively close to the masses, sympathizes with the suffering of the people, is relatively close to the lower-level soldiers, and knows deeply that "the hearts of the people cannot be deceived, and the will of the soldiers cannot be humiliated." He understands from the brave and heroic practical experience of Li Shimao, Wang Guocheng, and others that the invaders are not so terrible, that they must be defeated, and that they can be defeated. This is another force supporting him.
    Regarding Deng Shichang's life, the historical records are only a few words, and even these few words shine with immortal brilliance:
      "After the Zhiyuan warship had been fighting for a long time, it was injured and listing, and its ammunition was exhausted. Captain Deng Shichang, thinking that his ship could not be saved, should perish together with the enemy, so he drummed the wheels and rushed fiercely towards the Yoshino. Before reaching it, passing in front of the Dingyuan, it happened to hit the enemy's torpedo that was attacking the Dingyuan, the boiler burst, and the ship tilted to the left and sank in an instant. At the beginning of the Zhiyuan's forward rush, Shichang shouted: We have long since put life out of our minds in serving the country. Today, we can only die." ("A Study of the Battle Achievements of the Chinese Navy in the Sino-Japanese War")
    Rather be a shattered jade than an intact tile, the scene and the situation are vivid and lifelike.
    It is extremely commendable that the artists have created such a brilliant stage image based on the limited historical materials.
    Although Deng Shichang's stage image is largely based on the artists' imagination and fiction, it still reflects the reality of life. Under the conditions at the time, in colonial and semi-colonial countries, Deng Shichang's image was not only possible, but inevitable.
    Isn't that the objective reality? People suffer from the natural tyrant of great wind, great snow, great drought, and great flood, so there must be ambitious people who conquer the natural tyrant, and men of strong character who swear not to give up until they reach their goals, so there are legends and stories such as Kuafu chasing the sun, the Foolish Old Man moving mountains, and Yu the Great controlling the floods;
    Similarly, people suffer from national oppression and feudal oppression, so there must be ambitious people who oppose national oppression and feudal oppression, and men of strong character who are unyielding to the death. The vigorous and turbulent anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles of the Chinese working people have never stopped for a single day. Even within the exploiting classes, a part of people with national and democratic consciousness differentiated, and carried out heroic battles against national oppression and feudal oppression. Deng Shichang is a valuable example, but not the only one. Lin Yongsheng died at the same time as him, Guan Tianpei was in the Opium War fifty-four years before him, and Tan Sitong, who was loyal to his reform cause, was in the Hundred Days' Reform four years after him. ... It is truly heroic sacrifice, advancing wave upon wave.
    Deng Shichang was, after all, a naval officer of the Qing government, and the era he lived in was as far back as 1894. This, of course, also produced his class limitations and historical limitations. He did not want to fundamentally eliminate the feudal system, he did not want to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, and he did not want to deny Li Hongzhang's command of the North China Navy. However, he insisted on national integrity and promoted the spirit of patriotism, which is still worthy of praise. According to the viewpoint of historical materialism, reflecting it in art and on the stage will still play, and continue to play, an educational role.
    Deng Shichang's opposite, Fang Renqi, is also portrayed quite successfully.
    One is loyal, one is treacherous; one is the national integrity, one is the dregs of the nation; one is a revolutionary man of strong character, one is a reactionary soft-shelled turtle.
    Fang Renqi is the product of imperialist pressure and enticement. This product is also a reflection of the reality of life. Slaves who succumb to imperialist pressure and enticement have existed in history, and have not been extinct to this day in the vast colonial and semi-colonial countries.
    It is this Fang Renqi who, in the confrontation between the two armies, attempts to salute the enemy with cannon fire, who raises the white flag to surrender to the enemy, and who, when seeing friendly warships being surrounded and friendly ships sinking, sits idly by and turns away. His soul is no longer Chinese, and he has long surrendered to the enemy. Selling it to Fukushima from soul to body is just completing the final process.
    This stage image is a good negative teacher for the audience. In order to ensure victory in the struggle against the imperialists, we must always be on guard against such traitors and thieves. They will never lay down their butcher knives and become Buddhas on the spot. They are capable of anything.
    In this play, Li Hongzhang only appears in one act, but he profoundly portrays his昏庸腐朽.
    Li Hongzhang not only ceded power and humiliated the country to foreign countries, but also started his career by building the Huai Army and suppressing the Taiping Rebellion. His hands are stained with the blood of the people.
    Li Hongzhang is a comprador bureaucrat. The comprador bureaucrat class is the predecessor of China's big bourgeoisie, comprador bourgeoisie, and bureaucratic bourgeoisie. Many of the reactionary characteristics of Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, and others inherited the mantle of this class.
    Li Hongzhang's establishment of the navy, although he repeatedly said that it was to strengthen coastal defense and prevent foreign aggression, was in essence: one, as a weapon to suppress the people; two, as a tool for his own power struggle; and three, to open up markets for foreign arms merchants. His navy was to serve foreigners, and of course, there was no question of resisting foreign aggression.
    Li Hongzhang colluded with many imperialists at the same time, with varying degrees of intensity, and his relationship with Japan was also unclear.
    After the Yellow Sea battle, the Hanlin Academy jointly submitted a memorial to impeach Li Hongzhang, listing his crimes, including: "Japanese rice ships are released, Japanese transport of Kaiping coal is allowed, Japanese spies are caught, either openly released or privately released. ... The guns and artillery stored in the armory over the years have been mostly stolen and sold by the guards. And when the eastern affairs had already begun, he still checked out unusable muzzle-loading guns and sold them to Japan, receiving 140,000 taels of silver, which the bureau members divided among themselves, and Li Hongzhang provided them with a replenishment order. There are also rumors that Li Hongzhang has millions of taels of silver deposited in Japanese tea mountain and coal mining companies, and his sons have opened three foreign firms on various islands in Japan."
    Under these circumstances, it was impossible for Li Hongzhang to resolutely resist aggression.
    "The Sino-Japanese War at Sea 1894-1895" very cleverly reveals, through the scene of Li Hongzhang's inspection of Weihai, not only the corruption and昏庸 of the Qing government, but also that Li Hongzhang, who is famous for running foreign affairs, is in fact nothing more than a slave shared by many imperialists.
    Drawing the dragon and dotting the eyes, Li Hongzhang's words can be regarded as the highlight of the speech. He said: "Whether the country is preserved or not does not depend on foreign troubles. At most, cede Korea and pay some silver to the Japanese, and we can make peace. But to use heavy troops to deal with foreign troubles, if the soldiers are exhausted and the horses are exhausted, and the displaced people rise up in rebellion, causing internal chaos, that is a great disaster."
    Isn't it clear that he would rather submit to everything abroad in order to maintain his rule at home? Isn't Chiang Kai-shek's "pacifying internal affairs before resisting foreign aggression," with foreign being internal (originally one family with the imperialists), also finding a basis in Li Hongzhang's dictionary?
    Due to the corruption of the Qing government, and due to the treason of Li Hongzhang, Fang Renqi, and others, the Chinese side was completely defeated in the Sino-Japanese War. On the one hand, it further attracted imperialist aggression. On the other hand, it also saw hope from the Chinese people's and Chinese patriots' heroic resistance to the enemy: the Chinese nation will stand up sooner or later, and the Chinese people will overthrow the rule of imperialism and its lackeys sooner or later, and thus master their own destiny. "The Sino-Japanese War at Sea 1894-1895" vividly, vividly, and accurately reflects this historical trend!
    The entire performance is vigorous and exciting, a good teaching material for conducting patriotic education, and a song of praise for the men of strong character who insist on national integrity! (Attached pictures)

    爱国主义者的光辉形象
    马铁丁
    《甲午海战》中塑造了邓世昌这个动人的形象，是一个极大的胜利和成功。
    毛主席在谈到鲁迅的时候写道：
    “鲁迅的骨头是最硬的，他没有丝毫的奴颜和媚骨，这是殖民地半殖民地人民最可宝贵的性格。鲁迅是在文化战线上，代表全民族的大多数，向着敌人冲锋陷阵的最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的空前的民族英雄。”
    邓世昌当然不能与鲁迅相比，邓世昌不是共产主义者、也不是彻底的民主主义者，但是，他在勇于和民族敌人斗争这一点上，坚持民族气节这一点上，他是一个硬骨头。
    应该说，塑造一个优美的硬骨头形象，在今天有着它的巨大的现实意义和教育意义。
    这是因为我们有着两亿人口的非洲、两亿人口的拉丁美洲、八亿人口的亚洲，共十二亿人口正在进行着反帝国主义及其走狗的民族民主革命斗争；
    这是因为有着包括上述十二亿人口在内的人民，正进行着人民革命斗争；
    这是因为在共产党、工人阶级内部还存在着修正主义思潮。
    帝国主义者对革命、对人民、对被压迫民族惯用两套手法：一套是用硬的压，一套是软的骗。由于前者，就可能产生屈服于帝国主义者压力的软甲虫；由于后者就可能产生对帝国主义者的小恩小惠感恩戴德的奴才思想。
    就这样，勇于斗争，永不屈服，坚持真理，坚持正义的英雄，也就特别可贵，特别具有感人的力量。没有这样的硬骨头、铁打的硬汉，民族没有翻身的日子，人民没有翻身的日子！
    在邓世昌面前摆着这样两条路：向帝国主义者、向投降派屈服，可以立刻得到高官厚爵、锦衣玉帛；向帝国主义者、向投降派斗争，有抛掉乌纱帽、抛掉脑袋的危险。好个邓世昌！为坚持正义，为坚持民族气节，把个人的得失、生死置之度外。
    在第四场里，邓世昌的几段对话，确是精彩之作，邓世昌的精神境界，塑造得异常丰满。
    “福岛（即伪装为美国领事随员的罗皮尔）：是呵！北洋舰队要是再轻举妄动，开出来惹是生非，日本人就会说中国肆意挑衅，我们‘中立国’就难以说话！
    邓世昌：胡说八道！难道中国人保卫自己的江山是轻举妄动？难道北洋水师出海抗击日寇的侵略是惹是生非？难道日本鬼子卑鄙偷袭不宣而战反是中国在肆意挑衅？难道我们只有任人宰割坐以待毙，你们才好说话？简直是颠倒黑白，一派胡言！”
    舌剑唇枪，痛快淋漓，邓世昌伸张了正义，坚持了立场，讲出了千万人所想说、所要说的话，狠狠地给予侵略者一棒子！
    问题还不在福岛，问题在于，邓世昌与福岛针锋相对的斗争处在这样一个环境，其时李鸿章正热中于国际调停，这个买办官僚，正与列强们的使节打得火热，邓世昌这些话传到李鸿章的耳朵里，就不是一件小事。如果邓世昌没有一点骨气、一点胆量，那是万万不敢讲的。
    福岛说：“本人是不在意，不过如今李鸿章先生既然是主张国际调停，我想一个水师官员不应采用这样激烈的言词来破坏和谈的气氛。”这固然是对邓世昌的一种威胁，然而这又是实情，“破坏和谈”这个罪名加在邓世昌的身上，那是完全可能的。而且果然加到他的身上，他被革职了。由于丁汝昌的担保，他才起用。
    邓世昌对李鸿章的卖国行为怀着很大的愤懑，他对丁汝昌说：“中堂大人这是祸国殃民哪！”他对慈禧同样是“出言不逊”：“恕标下直言，大敌当前，水师军费不用于备置军火粮秣，而拿去修建万寿山颐和园，加添什么宝塔、湖景、彩亭、戏台，这简直是……”他对方仁启，一句话点出了他的丑恶的灵魂：“在外国人面前你没有了骨头！”
    在这场戏里，一方面是没有出场的李鸿章杯酒言欢之间在幕后进行卖国活动，另一方面是爱国者与侵略者，正义的力量与非正义的力量，进行了一场针锋相对的斗争。尽管侵略者与卖国贼加在一起，在表面上似乎占着优势，但是，邓世昌那种闪闪发光的爱国主义思想，显示出一种正必胜邪的神威！
    邓世昌在李鸿章面前揭发方仁启卖国投敌。被直接揭发的固然是方仁启，而同时，英帝国主义者、美帝国主义者、日帝国主义者、李鸿章这一大群丑类一个个被剥去了画皮。
    福岛是间谍，方仁启是奸细，人证物证俱在，不必去说了。美国人被迫脱下自己“公正”的外衣，公开袒护福岛。英国人与美国人之间可以在究竟和谁做生意这点上，发生争吵，可是把中国当作俎上之肉，则又是一致的。
    贝登说：“……罗皮尔先生既有犯罪嫌疑，的确应该追究。不过中日争端期间，在华日本侨民已委美国公使代管，我认为罗皮尔先生应作为有罪的日本侨民，交美国公使处置才是。”这是几句平常的话，却刻划得好，很确当地体现了英帝国主义者这个老狐狸的本色。既庇护了日本人、美国人，又替李鸿章的下台，搭了一个楼梯。所谓应该追究，不过是在《治外法权》下面的不予追究，也无法追究罢了。李鸿章在许多中国人、外国人面前得到了“应该追究”的面子，而日本人、美国人收到不加追究的实惠。中外反动派“皆大欢喜”！
    福岛、方仁启究竟是个什么东西，李鸿章自己自然心里明白，但是，他不好追究下去，也不敢追究下去，追下去很可能追到自己的头上。于是只好大事化小，小事化了。
    在李鸿章到贝登、到汉伦、到福岛、到方仁启这一群牛鬼蛇神面前，两相对照，黑白分明，邓世昌也就显得特别高大。
    一波未平，一波又起。第七场戏里达到了高潮的顶点。邓世昌是那么勇敢、机智、坚定、忠贞，从多方面展示了作为一个爱国者的精神境界。
    邓世昌与丘少龙有这末一段对话：
    “丘：管带，军门大人不在我们船上，我们怎么能随便升起帅旗？
    邓：军门是不在我们船上，但是没有帅旗就没有指挥，你没有看见船队已经开始混乱了吗？升起来！
    丘：邓管带，擅自升起帅旗，这是篡夺兵舰！
    邓：你说什么！！
    丘：管带，我们升起帅旗，日本兵舰就会集中炮火打我们呀！
    邓：大副，我们就是要分散敌人的炮火，让军门督舰突出重围，快升起来！……”
    一个考虑的是个人的安危，是权位之类的欲望；另一个考虑的是：把危险吸引到自己头上来，在一个危急的关头，当仁不让，为国家的利益、民族的利益，千方百计地去夺取战争的胜利。
    越是在危急的关头，就越是可以检验出一个人品质的优劣。谁是君子？谁是小人？谁是真金？谁是冒牌？判若泾渭，清清楚楚。邓世昌是君子，邓世昌是真金！
    最后，邓世昌在开高速撞敌舰的过程中英勇牺牲了。
    致远号沉没了，邓世昌的躯壳也沉没了。但是，爱国主义精神，作为一个中国人的革命骨气，却因此而新生，因此而青春永驻！
    不错，结局是一个悲剧。可是，从这悲剧中却产生了积极的力量。我们现在看到，我们的子子孙孙将永远看到：像邓管带、林管带那样大义凛然的民族英雄，他们是社会的榜样，民族的脊骨，他们永远活在人民的心里！
    在致远号加快航速撞击敌舰之前，那甲板上肃静庄严的水兵行列，那邓世昌眼神面对着前方的塑像，对我们是一个进军的号角，战斗的鼓舞！
    邓世昌的勇气从何而来？
    爱国主义的传统，初步的民主主义思想是支持他的一个力量；
    他比较接近群众，同情人民的疾苦，比较接近下层士兵，深知“民心不可欺，士志不可辱”，他从李仕茂、王国成他们那种勇敢、豪迈的实战经验中懂得：侵略者并不是那么可怕，必须打败，也是能够打败的。这又是支持他的另一个力量。
    关于邓世昌的生平，史书上的记载，只不过是只言片语，就是这只言片语，也从中闪耀着不灭的光辉：
      “致远舰接战既久，受伤欹侧，而子弹垂尽。管带邓世昌，念己舰即不能全，亦当与敌共碎，乃鼓轮向吉野猛冲。未至，过定远前，适撞敌方射攻定远之鱼雷，锅炉迸裂、舰左倾顷刻沉没。始致远前冲时，世昌大呼曰：我辈从公卫国早置生命于度外，今日有死而已”（《甲午中国海军战绩考》）
    宁为玉碎，勿为瓦全，其景其情，栩栩如生。
    艺术家们根据有限的史料，塑造出舞台上这样一个光辉的形象来，极其难能可贵。
    邓世昌这个舞台形象，虽然很大部分出于艺术家们的想像与虚构，然而，仍然是反映了生活的真实。邓世昌这个形象，在当时条件下，在殖民地、半殖民地的国家里，不仅是可能有的，而且必然会有的。
    客观的事实难道不正是这样吗？人们遭受大风大雪、大旱大涝的自然暴君的为害，也就一定产生征服自然暴君的志士、不达目的誓不休的硬骨头，因此有夸父追日、愚公移山、大禹治水等等传说和故事；
    同样的，人们遭受民族压迫、封建压迫，也就一定产生反民族压迫、反封建压迫的志士和至死不屈的硬骨头。中国劳动人民轰轰烈烈，风起云涌的反帝反封建斗争，就从没有一天停止过。就是剥削阶级内部，也分化出一部分有民族、民主意识的人，对民族压迫，封建压迫进行了英勇的战斗。邓世昌是其中可贵的一例，但并不是唯一的，与他同时牺牲的有林永升，在他前五十四年的鸦片战争中有过关天培，在他后四年的戊戌变法中，有过忠实于自己维新事业的谭嗣同。……真是英勇牺牲，前仆后继。
    邓世昌毕竟是清政府的海军军官，他所处的时代又远在1894年。这当然也就产生了他的阶级局限性、历史局限性。他并不想根本消灭封建制度，他并不想推翻清政府王朝，他也并不想否定李鸿章对华北海军的统率，然而，他坚持了民族气节，昂扬了爱国主义精神，仍然是可歌可泣的。根据历史唯物主义的观点，把它反映到艺术中来，舞台上来，仍然会起着、并继续不断地起着教育作用。
    邓世昌的对立面——方仁启也塑造得相当成功。
    一个是忠，一个是奸；一个是民族的正气，一个是国家的败类；一个是革命的硬骨头，一个是反动的软甲虫。
    方仁启是帝国主义的压力和诱骗下的产物。这个产物也同样是生活真实的反映。屈服于帝国主义压力和诱骗的奴才，历史上有过，在广大殖民地、半殖民地国家一直到现在，也还没有绝种。
    就是这个方仁启，在两军对垒中，企图向敌人鸣炮敬礼的是他，竖起白旗向敌人投降的是他，见友舰被围、友船沉没，坐视不救，掉头便走的也是他。他的灵魂早就不是中国人，早就向敌人投降了。从灵魂到肉体，一并在福岛手里拍卖，那不过是完成最后一道工序而已。
    这个舞台形象，对观众来说，是个良好的反面教员，为保证在与帝国主义者的斗争中取得胜利，必须时时刻刻谨防这类奸细蟊贼，他们决不会放下屠刀，立地成佛，他们是什么都会干得出来的。
    在这个戏里，李鸿章仅仅出来一场，然而，相当深刻地刻划了他的昏庸腐朽。
    李鸿章不仅对外丧权辱国，而且是搞淮军、镇压太平天国运动起家的，他的双手沾满人民的鲜血。
    李鸿章是个官僚买办。官僚买办这个阶层，是中国大资产阶级、买办资产阶级、官僚资产阶级的前身，蒋介石、汪精卫等等的许多反动特性，就是继承了这个阶层的衣钵。
    李鸿章的办海军，虽然口口声声说是为了加强海防，防备洋人侵犯。实质上，一则当作镇压人民的武器，二则当作自己争权夺利的工具，三则是为外国的军火商人开辟市场。他的海军就是替洋人服务的，当然谈不上抵御外侮。
    李鸿章轻重不等地同时与许多帝国主义勾搭，其中与日本的关系也是不清不楚的。
    黄海战后，翰林院联名奏参李鸿章，列举罪状，其中有：“倭米船则放之，倭运开平煤则听之，倭谍被获，非明纵则私放。……军械所历年所储枪炮，多被监守盗卖。及东事已起，犹检出不合用之前膛枪子，卖与日本，得银十四万两，局员朋分，而李鸿章为之补给领字。外间并有传闻，李鸿章有银数百万，寄存日本茶山煤矿公司，伊子又在日本各岛开设洋行三所。”
    在这种情况下，要李鸿章坚决抵抗侵略，乃是不可能的。
    “甲午海战”非常巧妙地通过李鸿章至威海检阅这场戏，不仅揭露了清政府的腐败昏庸，而且揭露了办洋务出名的李鸿章其实无非是许多帝国主义者所共有的奴才。
    画龙点睛，李鸿章这一段话可算是点睛之谈，他说：“社稷保不保，不在于外患，对日本人大不了让出朝鲜，赔点银子，就可以讲和的。而动用重兵去对付外患，倘日后兵穷马尽，流民起来造反，闹开了内乱，那才是大祸害。”
    宁可对外一切屈服，以维持其对内的统治，难道还不是明明白白吗？蒋介石的安内攘外，外即是内（与帝国主义者原是一家），难道不也是在李鸿章的字典里找到根据吗？
    由于清政府的腐朽，由于李鸿章、方仁启之流的卖国，甲午海战中，中国方面彻底失败了。一方面进一步地引来了帝国主义的侵略，另一方面，却也从中国人民、中国的爱国人士英勇抗敌中看到了希望：中华民族或迟或早会站起来的，中国人民或迟或早会推翻帝国主义及其走狗的统治，从而掌握自己的命运的。《甲午海战》形象地、生动地、准确地反映了这个历史发展趋势！
    整个戏的演出，气势蓬勃，激动人心，是进行爱国主义教育的良好教材，是对坚持民族气节的硬骨头的颂歌！（附图片）
