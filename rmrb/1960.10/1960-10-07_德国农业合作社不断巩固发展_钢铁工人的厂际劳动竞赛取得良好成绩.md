Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th. Our correspondent reports: Since the complete collectivization of agriculture in the German Democratic Republic in mid-April of this year, the vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives have been developed and consolidated, and cooperatives have shown great advantages in agricultural production.

After completing agricultural collectivization, the German Democratic Republic now has more than 19,300 agricultural cooperatives, including more than 13,000 type-one (primary) cooperatives and more than 6,000 type-three (advanced) cooperatives. Therefore, consolidating type-one cooperatives is of particular importance. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions have taken the study of cooperative charters by members as one of the measures to consolidate the cooperatives. By the end of August, 98.6% of type-one cooperatives had passed their charters, and 48.4% of cooperatives had formulated various internal rules and regulations based on their charters. The vast majority of newly established cooperatives have organized labor teams to carry out collective farming. Some advanced cooperatives have initially explored experiences in labor quotas, labor remuneration, and feed distribution based on their own practices.

Newly established cooperatives generally pay attention to promoting internal democracy, and convene members' meetings to discuss and make decisions on major issues. At present, many cooperatives have discussed collective autumn planting and crop rotation plans. Some cooperatives also pay attention to absorbing members to participate in various management tasks of the cooperatives, in order to cultivate members' collectivist ideology and strengthen their sense of responsibility towards the cooperatives.

The state's support for agriculture also helps to consolidate agricultural cooperatives. In addition to providing assistance to agricultural production cooperatives in terms of agricultural machinery, building materials, and chemical products, the state also provides manpower support. Under this year's unfavorable climatic conditions, more than 500,000 cadres from government agencies went to the countryside to help cooperatives with harvesting, thereby completing the summer harvest of grain ahead of schedule. In the current harvesting of corn and other crops, another 120,000 cadres from government agencies have gone to the countryside to participate in labor.

A thriving scene has emerged in agricultural production after collectivization. This year, the national summer harvest of grain, corn, potatoes, beets and other crops has increased compared to last year. Corn production increased by 45% compared to last year. The increase in agricultural production in the German Democratic Republic and the support for agriculture from various quarters stand in stark contrast to the tragic bankruptcy of small farmers in West Germany. These facts have greatly raised the awareness of farmers in the German Democratic Republic and demonstrated the superiority of the socialist system.

After collectivization, the livestock breeding industry in the German Democratic Republic has also developed. By June of this year, the number of cattle raised nationwide reached more than 4.68 million, and the number of pigs reached more than 7.61 million; both increased by 6% compared to the same period last year. At present, some type-one cooperatives have begun to raise livestock collectively.

In order to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives, all parts of the country also pay attention to organizing experience exchange work. In June and July this year, a large number of chairmen and members of type-one cooperatives were organized to visit and study the 8th Agricultural Exhibition held near Leipzig. In mid-September, a meeting was held in Jüterbog to exchange experiences of type-one cooperatives. In early December this year, the German Democratic Republic will also hold the Sixth National Farmers' Congress to summarize and exchange experiences, promote the development of agricultural production and further consolidate agricultural production cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 4th. The inter-factory labor competition among steel plants in the German Democratic Republic, which began in early September this year, has achieved good results. As of the end of September, seven major state-owned steel plants across the country had overproduced more than 9,000 tons of steel.

The central slogan of this labor competition is "Produce more steel for the Republic." After the competition was launched, factories put forward guarantees one after another, striving to produce 65,000 tons of steel more than originally planned by the end of this year.

In the competition, the four steel plants in Gröditz, Hennigsdorf, Freital, and Thale are in the lead. They have overfulfilled their September production plans. The Gröditz steel plant in the Dresden district overfulfilled its September production plan by 10.8%. The Hennigsdorf steel plant overfulfilled its plan by 4.7%. This plant produced 1,534 tons of steel on September 30 alone.

This steel production competition not only requires factories to well implement the most important national plan indicators, but also requires reducing costs and maximizing productivity. In the competition, factories handed over the plan to the workers for discussion. The workers gave full play to their enthusiasm and creativity, further developed socialist collective labor, and paid attention to technological innovation. In the Gröditz and Riesa steel plants, workers used various methods to improve the utilization rate of open-hearth furnaces. For example, workers at the Riesa steel plant shortened the overhaul work of each open-hearth furnace by 24 hours, which is equivalent to producing 300 tons of steel more during this period. By the end of September, the Hennigsdorf steel plant had saved 14 million marks for the country, which is equivalent to the total savings for the entire year last year.

Recently, the West German government unilaterally announced that it would abolish the trade agreement between the two Germanys at the end of the year, which has further stimulated the determination of steelworkers in the German Democratic Republic to increase production. The workers of the Hennigsdorf steel plant have put forward a combat plan to produce 21,500 tons of steel more by the end of this year in response to West Germany's provocations.

### 德国农业合作社不断巩固发展  钢铁工人的厂际劳动竞赛取得良好成绩

    德国农业合作社不断巩固发展
    钢铁工人的厂际劳动竞赛取得良好成绩
    新华社柏林6日电　本社记者报道：德意志民主共和国自今年4月中旬实现农业全部合作化以后，绝大部分农业生产合作社已经得到发展和巩固，合作社在农业生产中显示出很大优越性。
    在完成农业合作化之后，德意志民主共和国现在共有一万九千三百多个农业合作社，其中，一型（初级）社有一万三千多个，三型（高级）社有六千多个。因此，巩固一型社就具有特别重要的意义。各地农业合作社把通过和组织社员学习合作社章程作为巩固合作社的措施之一。到8月底为止，已有98.6％的一型社通过了社章，有48.4％的合作社根据社章制定了社内各种制度。绝大部分新成立的合作社组织了劳动队，进行集体耕作。一些先进的合作社已经根据自己的实践，初步摸索出有关劳动定额、劳动报酬、饲料分配等方面的经验。
    新成立的合作社一般都注意到发扬社内民主，遇有重大问题则召开社员大会来讨论作出决定。目前，许多合作社已经讨论了集体秋播和轮耕计划。有些合作社还注意吸收社员们参加合作社的各项管理工作，借以培养社员的集体主义思想和加强他们对合作社的责任感。
    国家所组织的对农业的支援也有助于农业合作社的巩固。国家除了在农业机械、建筑材料和化学产品等方面给农业生产合作社以帮助外，还给予了人力上的支援。在今年气候条件不好的情况下，全国先后有五十万以上的机关干部下乡，帮助合作社收割，从而提前完成了谷物的夏收工作。在当前的玉米等作物的收获工作中，又有十二万机关干部下乡参加劳动。
    合作化后的农业生产出现了一片欣欣向荣景象。今年全国夏收谷物、玉米、马铃薯、甜菜等作物的产量均较去年增加。玉米的产量较去年增加了45％。德意志民主共和国农业生产的增加以及各方面支援农业的情况，与西德小农破产的惨状形成鲜明的对照。这些事实大大提高了德意志民主共和国农民的觉悟，显示出社会主义制度的优越性。
    合作化后，德意志民主共和国的牲畜饲养业也有所发展。到今年6月份，全国牛的饲养头数达到四百六十八万头以上，猪达到七百六十一万多口；均比去年同期增加6％。目前，一些一型社已开始有了社养牲畜。
    为了巩固农业生产合作社，全国各地还注意组织经验交流的工作。今年6、7月间，各地曾组织大批一型社社长、社员前往在来比锡近郊举行的第八届农业展览会参观学习。9月中旬，在居特堡举行了一型社交流经验会议。今年12月初，德意志民主共和国还将召开第六次全国农民会议，总结和交流经验，促进农业生产的发展和进一步巩固农业生产合作社。
    新华社柏林4日电　今年9月初在德意志民主共和国展开的各钢铁厂之间的厂际劳动竞赛，已经取得了良好的成绩。截至9月底为止，全国七个主要国营钢铁厂已经超额生产了九千多吨钢。
    这个劳动竞赛的中心口号是“为共和国生产更多的钢”。竞赛开展后，各厂纷纷提出保证，争取到今年年底比原计划多生产六万五千吨钢。
    在竞赛中，格勒迪茨、赫宁斯多夫、弗赖塔耳、塔尔四个钢铁厂走在最前面。它们已超额完成9月份的生产计划。德累斯顿专区的格勒迪茨钢厂超额完成9月份生产计划的10.8％。赫宁斯多夫钢厂则超额4.7％完成计划，这个厂仅在9月30日这一天就生产了一千五百三十四吨钢。
    这次钢铁生产竞赛不但要求各厂很好地执行最重要的国家计划指标，而且要求降低成本、最大限度地提高生产率。在竞赛中，工厂把计划交给工人讨论，工人们发挥了劳动积极性和创造性，进一步开展了社会主义集体劳动，并注意技术革新。在格勒迪茨和里扎钢厂，工人们用各种办法提高了平炉的利用率。例如，里扎钢厂的工人把每一座平炉的检修工作缩短二十四小时，这等于在这期间多生产三百吨钢。赫宁斯多夫钢厂到9月底已为国家节约了一千四百万马克，相当于去年全年节约的数字。
    最近，西德政府片面宣布要在年底废除两个德国的贸易协定，这更激发了德意志民主共和国钢铁工人增加生产的决心。赫宁斯多夫钢厂的工人提出了到今年年底多生产二万一千五百吨钢材的战斗计划，以此来回答西德的挑衅。
