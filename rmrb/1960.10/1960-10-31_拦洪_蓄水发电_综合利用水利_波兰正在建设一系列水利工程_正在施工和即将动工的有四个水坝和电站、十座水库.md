Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 28th. Poland is currently undertaking a series of large-scale water conservancy construction projects, including dredging rivers, building dikes, and reservoirs, in order to eradicate floods and achieve the comprehensive utilization of water resources.

Currently under construction or about to begin construction are four dams and hydropower stations, ten reservoirs (with a total storage capacity of 950 million cubic meters), as well as a number of dredging riverbeds, repairing dikes and other projects.

The Vistula and Oder rivers are Poland's main rivers, and many water conservancy projects are concentrated on these two rivers. At present, large-scale reservoir repairs have begun in the mountainous tributary areas of the upper reaches of the Vistula River. Construction has begun on the Tresna Reservoir and two small reservoirs on the Sola River, with a reservoir storage capacity of 102 million cubic meters. The Dębe Reservoir on the Bug River, a tributary in the middle reaches of the Vistula River, which began construction in 1957, will soon be completed. This reservoir will not only play a role in flood storage, but the water it impounds can be used to irrigate large areas of farmland and drive 16,000 kilowatt generators to generate electricity. The large Włocławek dam and hydropower station on this river are also under intensive construction. In the Oron area of the San River, another tributary, the construction of another giant reservoir is about to begin. In addition, Poland is also preparing to build a large reservoir and several small reservoirs in Czorsztyn, on the Dunajec River, the most dangerous tributary of the Vistula River. The design work for these reservoirs has already begun. After the reservoirs are completed, they can store 450 million cubic meters of water, which can ultimately eliminate floods in the upper reaches of the Vistula River. A hydropower station with a power generation capacity of 400,000 kilowatts can also be built next to the reservoir.

A series of reservoirs and dikes are also planned to be built in the upper reaches of the Oder River, with a total reservoir capacity of 120 million cubic meters.

    拦洪　蓄水发电　综合利用水利
    波兰正在建设一系列水利工程
    正在施工和即将动工的有四个水坝和电站、十座水库
    新华社华沙28日电　目前波兰正在进行疏浚河流、兴修堤坝、水库等一系列大规模水利建设工程，以便根绝水患和达到综合利用水利的目的。
    现在正在施工和即将动工的水利建设项目有四个水坝和水电站、十座水库（总蓄水量达九亿五千万立方米），以及若干疏浚河床、维修堤防等工程项目。
    维斯杜拉河和奥得河是波兰的主要河流，很多水利工程项目都集中在这两条河流上。现在，在维斯杜拉河上游的高山支流地区，已经开始大修水库。已经动工兴修的有索列河上的特雷斯尼水库和两座小水库，水库蓄水量将达一亿二百万立方米。1957年动工的维斯杜拉河中游支流布格河上的登布水库，不久即可完工。这座水库不仅将可发挥蓄洪的作用，它所拦蓄的水可以用来灌溉大片农田，推动一万六千瓩的发电机发电。这条河流上的伏沃茨瓦维克大型水坝和水电站也在加紧施工。在它的另一支流桑河的奥隆地方，即将开始建设另一座巨型水库。此外，波兰还准备在维斯杜拉河最凶险的支流杜纳耶茨河上的乔尔什廷地方建设一座大水库和几座小水库。这些水库的设计工作已经开始，水库建成后可以蓄水四亿五千万立方米，可以最终消除维斯杜拉河上游水灾，水库旁还可以建设一座发电能力为四十万瓩的水电站。
    奥得河上游预计也要建设一系列水库和堤坝，水库的总蓄水量将达一亿二千万立方米。
