    Algerian "El Moudjahid" Newspaper Comments on the Great Significance of Premier Abbas's Visit to China
    Chinese People's Support for Algeria's Anti-Imperialist Struggle Will Accelerate the Algerian People's Advance Toward Victory
    Points Out That Only Armed Forces Can Eliminate Imperialist Armed Forces
    Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, October 12th: The Algerian National Liberation Front's newspaper "El Moudjahid" published an article on the 10th regarding the visit to China by the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, headed by Premier Abbas, stating, "The warm welcome our delegation received in People's China, and the important achievements made in the delegation's talks with Chinese leaders, all of these open up broad paths before the Algerian people to accelerate the realization of complete victory and the attainment of freedom and independence."
    The article, titled "Only Armed Forces Can Eliminate Imperialism's Armed Forces," provided a detailed report on the visit of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria to China.
    The article also pointed out, "Western imperialism is very afraid of the development of the Algerian question on an international scale and the increase in Algeria's supporters. The Algerian delegation's visit to China is a major cause of this fear."
    Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, October 14th: The Algerian "El Moudjahid" newspaper, published in Tunis today, published an article stating, "The welcome given by the Chinese people and Chinese leaders to the Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria and his delegation, the talks between the Prime Minister and Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, and the signing of a joint communique in Beijing on October 5th, all demonstrate the clear attitude of our Chinese friends, and demonstrate the unwavering support of the People's Republic of China for our struggle."
    The article further stated, "Premier Abbas and Premier Zhou Enlai, representing their respective governments, condemned the aggressive acts of imperialists in Africa and Asia, and reaffirmed the determination of the two governments to strongly oppose the aggressive acts of imperialists. They condemned the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, mainly the United States, for supporting France in continuing its colonial war in Algeria. The Chinese government reaffirmed its firm position to unswervingly aid and support the struggle of the Algerian people."
    The article stated, "When people say that the Algerian question has become an international question, this does not merely mean that it is a question of concern to the international community and governments of various countries, but it means that in this war between Algeria and France, France has its allies, and Algeria also has its own allies. From Rabat to Beijing, a continuous series of countries support the struggle of the Algerian people. Today, the importance attached to the Algerian question internationally demonstrates the victory of the Algerian revolution and the victory of the Bandung Group."
    In condemning the collusion of the North Atlantic Group with France in the Algerian war, the article emphasized, "Without this complicity of the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, France would have long been completely isolated internationally. Therefore, the United States not only helps France to conduct a colonialist war, but more seriously, it has encouraged France to continue this war in the past and continues to do so now. Obviously, the West agrees with France pursuing a colonial policy in Algeria within the scope of 'Western defense.' Therefore, the West itself has turned the Franco-Algerian war into a Western-Algerian war."
    The article finally emphasized, "The people of the 'Maghreb countries' (referring to the three North African countries of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia - editor's note) will be able to deal with this collusion of imperialism. They will do everything in their power to strive for the liberation of Algeria and the end of the colonial war that threatens their survival and security."

### 中国人民支持阿尔及利亚反帝斗争将加速阿尔及利亚人民向胜利前进

    阿“圣战者报”评阿巴斯总理访华重大意义
    中国人民支持阿尔及利亚反帝斗争将加速阿尔及利亚人民向胜利前进
    指出只有用武装力量才能消灭帝国主义武装力量
    新华社拉巴特12日电　阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线机关报“圣战者报”10日就以阿巴斯总理为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团访问中国发表文章说，“我们的代表团在人民中国受到的热情欢迎，代表团同中国领袖们会谈所取得的重要成就，所有这些在阿尔及利亚人民面前开辟了加速实现彻底的胜利、获得自由和独立的广阔的道路。”
    这篇题为“只有用武装力量才能消灭帝国主义的武装力量”的文章，详细报道了阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团在中国访问的情况。
    文章还指出，“西方帝国主义非常害怕阿尔及利亚问题在国际范围内的发展和阿尔及利亚支持者的增加。阿尔及利亚代表团在中国的访问是这种恐惧的主要原因。”
    新华社突尼斯14日电　今天在突尼斯出版的阿尔及利亚“圣战者报”发表文章说，“中国人民和中国领导人对阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理及其代表团的欢迎，总理同毛泽东主席、周恩来总理的会谈，10月5日在北京签订联合公报，这些都表明我们的中国朋友的明确态度，表明中华人民共和国坚定不移地支持我们的斗争”。
    文章又说，“阿巴斯总理和周恩来总理代表各自的政府谴责了帝国主义者在非洲和亚洲的侵略行为，重申两国政府决意强烈反对帝国主义者的侵略行为。他们谴责北大西洋公约组织各国，主要是美国支持法国在阿尔及利亚继续进行殖民战争。中国政府重申它的坚定立场，要坚持不渝地援助和支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争”。
    文章说，“当人们说阿尔及利亚问题已经成为国际问题，这并不仅仅是说，它是国际上和各国政府所关心的问题，而是意味着，在这场阿尔及利亚和法国之间的战争中，法国有它的盟国，阿尔及利亚也有自己的盟国。从拉巴特到北京，连绵不绝的一系列的国家支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。今天，阿尔及利亚问题在国际上受到的重视，表明了阿尔及利亚革命的胜利和万隆集团的胜利”。
    在谴责北大西洋集团在阿尔及利亚战争中同法国狼狈为奸时，文章强调指出，“如果没有美国和北大西洋公约组织的这种同谋，法国就会早已在国际上陷入完全的孤立了。因此，美国不仅帮助法国进行殖民主义战争，而且更严重的是，它过去和现在一直鼓励法国继续这场战争。显然，西方赞同法国在“西方防务”范围内在阿尔及利亚奉行殖民政策。因此，西方本身把法国—阿尔及利亚战争变成了西方—阿尔及利亚战争”。
    文章最后强调指出，“马格里布各国”（指阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥、突尼斯等北非三国——编者注）人民将能对付帝国主义的这种勾结。他们将竭尽所能不遗余力，来争取阿尔及利亚的解放和结束威胁他们的生存和安全的殖民战争。”
