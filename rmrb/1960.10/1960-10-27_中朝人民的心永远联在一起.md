　　October 25, 1950, the Chinese people sent their most outstanding sons and daughters – the Chinese People's Volunteers, marching across the Yalu River in high spirits. Now, ten years have passed. To defend peace in Asia and the world, and to oppose American imperialist aggression, the Volunteers raised the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, protecting our homes and defending our country, and fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army. After three years of heroic struggle, they finally forced American imperialism to sign the armistice agreement on July 27, 1953.

　　While celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering Korea to resist America and aid Korea, my thoughts returned to the days of fighting in Korea. During the war years, under the correct leadership of the Party, the people of China and Korea forged an unbreakable fraternal fighting friendship with blood in the war against imperialism and aggression and in defense of peace.

　　Park Jae-geun, the most outstanding soldier of the Korean people, spared no personal life, braved the hail of bullets, and shielded the wounded of the Chinese People's Volunteers resisting America and aiding Korea with his own body. His great internationalist spirit inspired every commander and fighter of the Volunteers. He was a vanguard fighter of the Korean people's anti-American and anti-aggression struggle, and a shining example of the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.

　　Luo Shengjiao, the most outstanding son of the Chinese people and a great internationalist fighter, heroically gave his precious life for the Korean people and the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. His great internationalist spirit will forever inspire the warm enthusiasm of the Chinese and Korean people to jointly oppose imperialist aggression. He was a good fighter taught by Chairman Mao, his spirit is immortal, and his name will shine forever.

　　Park Jae-geun and Luo Shengjiao, their blood was not shed in vain, it was exchanged for the victory of the war to resist America and aid Korea, making the long-standing friendship between China and Korea even more consolidated and developed.

　　After the armistice, the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people continued to develop further in the struggle against American imperialist aggression, maintaining the armistice agreement, realizing the reunification of the Korean nation, and building socialism in both countries. I remember that in 1956, when our troops were building barracks, our company lived in Gaechon-ri, Icheon County (gun). In order to occupy fewer houses of the villagers, a small shed was built in the middle of the village as a kitchen. In July, during the rainy season, at noon on the 14th, a typhoon suddenly blew up and heavy rain fell. The comrades were not at home and had no time to rescue the shed. The shed was blown down, the rice pot was broken, and the two big pots of rice and vegetables were washed into the mud pit, turning into thick mud. The two large vats filled with pickled vegetables were also smashed, and the cooking coal was washed into the river.

　　After the storm, the comrades returned, and they were not worried about not having lunch, but continued to prepare for labor in the afternoon. However, the villagers in the village were all very busy. Elder Grandpa Liu Deming hurriedly reported the situation that the troops had not eaten lunch to the production team leader. Before long, more than thirty villagers in the whole village each brought out the dry firewood they had saved to get through the rainy season, competing to send it to us to cook, and Ajimae (old grandma) gave us the best pickled sour cabbage, and vacated the pot to help us cook.

　　Three or four houses of the villagers were also collapsed. The house of Elder Grandpa Liu Wanhe, where our class lived, was also blown down by the typhoon. Grandpa Liu immediately vacated two of his three rooms for us to live in. We saw that his family of more than ten people was crammed into a small room, how could we bear it? The comrades just gestured to express their thanks, and refused to go in. Grandpa Liu was so kind, seeing that we refused to go in, he moved our luggage and utensils into the house. The comrades still wanted to take things away, so he told Ajimae to block the door on one side, and pushed everyone into the house one by one, and after arguing, it was decided to live in one room. The Korean people's care for the Volunteers as if they were their own children made us deeply feel the warmth of the socialist family.

　　In May 1957, it was the season for transplanting rice seedlings in Korea. Icheon County had not had a drop of rain for more than eighty days, the rice seedlings that had been transplanted were about to dry up, and more than fifty mu of paddy fields were short of water and could not be planted. It looked like it was going to become wasteland.

　　As the drought intensified, our mood became heavier and heavier. The comrades proposed to overcome the drought together with the Korean people, and drive away the drought like fighting the American devils together. Our Battalion Commander Yu Ping was a third-class disabled revolutionary soldier. With his own exemplary actions, he led the comrades of the entire battalion to overcome difficulties in every possible way, to harvest one more kilogram of grain for the Korean people, and launched a battle against the drought. What to do without water lifting tools? Vegetable basins, washbasins, rice buckets, and even the American devils' brains (helmets) were all used; what to do without water sources? Go to the Imjin River three or four miles away to transport it. The shoulders trained by carrying guns and cannons can carry, and the legs trained by chasing enemies can run. There are no difficulties that cannot be overcome in front of the Volunteers. The rice seedlings were rushed to be planted, and a bumper harvest was achieved in the summer. We celebrated the harvest with the Korean people as in previous years.

　　In the spring of 1958, the Volunteers were about to return to their country. Everyone suggested that, on the eve of leaving the Korean elders and close comrades-in-arms of the People's Army, we should do something beneficial as a souvenir. The battalion party committee decided, according to the comrades' proposal, to open up a paddy field on the wasteland next to the highway at the foot of the mountain. While we were busy preparing for work, on March 12, Premier Kim Il-sung, the most respected leader of the Korean people, came from afar to give us pre-departure instructions. I and more than ten comrades in the company were honored to meet the respected Premier Kim. Premier Kim's care for the Volunteers aroused my reluctant mood even more, and everyone was more motivated to open up the paddy field.

　　In March, the weather was still freezing, twenty degrees below zero, and the frozen soil layer of more than eighty centimeters, how could it be possible to rely on the pickaxes left with less than twenty centimeters after digging dozens of tunnels? The company commander said: There are bomb fragments left by the American devils by the Seongbuk-ri Bridge, take them to make tools ourselves. That night, the repair class carried the bomb fragments and hammered them into pickaxes. Everyone took out the energy of building the underground Great Wall (tunnel) and declared war on the frozen soil. The villagers all ran to participate in the war, the young men opened the land, the girls delivered water, and Ajimae also brought needles and cloth to sew blistered hands for us. There were only two days left before returning home, and everyone worked even harder, attacking at night with lanterns and torches. In order to commemorate the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, the agricultural production cooperative named this paddy field the "China-Korea Friendship Field." At the completion ceremony, a gala was held, and Chinese rice and Korean rice were mixed together to make a meal of "China-Korea Friendship Rice." We ate "China-Korea Friendship Rice" and danced "China-Korea Friendship Dance," and the hearts of the Chinese and Korean people were even closer.

　　Our Chinese People's Volunteers, in order to promote peace in Asia and the world, have, in accordance with the declarations of the Chinese and Korean governments, completely withdrawn to our motherland for two years. However, the heinous American imperialists, ignoring the strong condemnation of the Chinese and Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world, are still staying in South Korea, and are intensifying the arming of the South Korean puppet regime, antagonizing the Korean people, and hindering the peaceful reunification of Korea.

　　We firmly support the Korean people's just struggle to realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland. We warn the American warmongers to get out of Taiwan and South Korea immediately. If you dare to provoke a new war, we will definitely make you suffer a more miserable defeat than on the Korean battlefield.

    中朝人民的心永远联在一起
    黄治富
    1950年10月25日，中国人民派出了自己最优秀的儿女——中国人民志愿军，雄赳赳、气昂昂地跨过鸭绿江，到现在已经十年了。为了保卫亚洲和世界的和平，反对美帝国主义侵略，志愿军举起了抗美援朝、保家卫国的旗帜，同朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军一道并肩作战，经过三年的英勇斗争，终于在1953年7月27日，迫使美帝国主义在停战协定上签了字。
    在庆祝志愿军抗美援朝入朝参战十周年的时候，我的思想又回到了在朝鲜战斗的日子。在战争的年代里，中朝两国人民在党的正确领导下，在反帝反侵略、保卫和平的战争中，用鲜血凝成了牢不可破的兄弟的战斗友谊。
    朝鲜人民最优秀的战士朴在根，曾不惜个人的生命，冒着枪林弹雨，以自己的身体掩护了中国人民抗美援朝的志愿军伤员。他的伟大国际主义精神，鼓舞了志愿军的每一个指战员。他是朝鲜人民反美反侵略斗争的先锋战士，是中朝人民友谊的光辉范例。
    中国人民最优秀的儿子、伟大的国际主义战士罗盛教，为了朝鲜人民和中朝人民的友谊，英勇地献出了自己的宝贵生命。他这种伟大的国际主义精神，永远鼓舞着中朝两国人民共同反对帝国主义侵略的斗争热忱。他是毛主席教导的好战士，他的精神永垂不朽，他的名子永放光芒。
    朴在根、罗盛教，他们的血没有白流，换来了抗美援朝战争的胜利，使得有着悠久传统的中朝友谊更加巩固和发展了。
    停战后，中朝人民的友谊，又在继续反对美帝国主义的侵略，维护停战协定，实现朝鲜民族统一和两国社会主义建设的斗争中，得到了进一步的发展。我记得，1956年，我们部队修建营房的时候，我们连住在伊川郡（县）开川里。为了少占用老乡的房子，在村中间搭了个小草棚做了伙房。7月份，正是雨季，14日那天中午，突然刮起了台风，下起了暴雨。同志们不在家，来不及抢救。草棚被刮倒了，饭锅被打破了，满满的两大锅饭和菜冲到泥坑里去了，变成了浠泥浆子。腌满咸菜的两个大缸也被砸烂了，烧饭煤也冲进了大河。
    暴风雨过后，同志们回来，并没有因吃不上午饭着急，仍然准备着下午继续劳动。可是，村里的社员都忙坏了。柳得明老大爷赶忙把部队中午没吃饭的情况报告给生产队长。不大一会，全村三十多户社员，每家都抱出自己保存好准备过雨季的干柴火，争先恐后的送给我们做饭，阿妈妮（老大娘）把自己腌得最好的酸白菜给我们吃，又腾锅帮我们烧饭。
    社员的房子，也倒了三、四户。我们班借住的柳万和老大爷的房子，也被台风刮倒了。柳大爷马上把自己的三间房子腾出二间让我们住。我们看到他家十多口人挤在一间小房里，怎过意得去呢？同志们只是比划手势表示谢意，不肯进去。柳大爷太好啦，见我们不肯进去，他就往屋里搬我们的行李和用具。同志们仍要拿东西走，他就一面叫阿妈妮挡住门，一面把大家一个个的推到屋里去，争来拉去才确定住一间。朝鲜人民像对待自己儿女一样的关怀志愿军，使我们深深感到社会主义大家庭的温暖。
    1957年5月份，在朝鲜正是插秧的季节。伊川郡地区已有八十多天没下过一滴雨，已经插下的秧苗快干死了，还有缺水的五十多亩稻田不能栽了，眼看要变成荒地。
    随着旱象的加重，我们心情也越来越沉重。同志们纷纷提出和朝鲜人民一起战胜旱灾，像共同打美国鬼子一样的把旱灾赶跑。我们营长俞平同志，是个三等残废革命军人。他以自己的模范行动，带领着全营的同志，千方百计克服困难，为朝鲜人民多收一斤粮，向旱灾展开了战斗。没有提水工具怎么办？菜盆、洗脸盆，装饭桶，还有美国鬼子的脑袋瓜（钢盔），都用上了；没有水源怎样办？到三、四里外的临津江去运。扛枪炮练出来的肩能挑，追击敌人练出来的腿能跑，志愿军面前没有克服不了的困难。稻秧抢栽上了，夏天得到了丰收。我们和往年一样，同朝鲜人民共庆丰收。
    1958年春天，志愿军要归国了。大家都建议，在离别朝鲜父老和亲密战友人民军的前夕做一件有益的事情，作为留念。营党委决定，按照同志们的提议，在山脚下公路旁的荒地上，开一块水稻田。当我们正忙着准备工作的时候，3月12日那天，朝鲜人民最敬爱的领袖金日成首相，特远道赶来给我们作临别教导，我和连里十多名同志荣幸的见到了敬爱的金首相。金首相对志愿军的关怀更激起我恋恋不舍的心情，大家开水稻田的劲头更足了。
    3月份的天气，还是滴水成冰，零下二十多度，八十多公分的冻土层，光靠这挖过几十条坑道剩下不到二十公分的十字镐那能行呢？连长说：成北里大桥边有美国鬼子扔下的炸弹片，拿来自己造工具。当夜修理班把弹片抬来打成了洋镐。大家拿出了当年修地下长城（坑道）的劲头，向冰土开战了。社员们都纷纷跑来参战，小伙子开地，姑娘们送水，阿妈妮还带着针和布，给我们穿泡包手。离回国的日子只剩两天了，大家干的更猛了，黑夜打着灯笼火把突击。为了纪念中朝人民的友谊，农业生产合作社把这块稻田命名为“中朝友谊田”。在落成的时候，开了联欢会，还把中国大米和朝鲜大米掺到一起做了一顿“中朝友谊饭”。我们吃着“中朝友谊饭”，跳着“中朝友谊舞”，中朝人民的心贴的更紧了。
    我们中国人民志愿军为了促进亚洲和世界的和平，遵照中朝两国政府的声明，已全部撤回自己的祖国两年了。可是，万恶的美帝国主义，却无视中朝人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的强烈谴责，仍赖在南朝鲜，并变本加厉的武装南朝鲜傀儡政权，与朝鲜人民为敌，阻挠朝鲜的和平统一。
    我们坚决支持朝鲜人民为实现祖国和平统一的正义斗争，我们警告美国战争贩子们，赶快从台湾和南朝鲜滚出去。如果胆敢挑起新的战争，我们一定叫你遭到比在朝鲜战场上更加惨重的失败。
