    The Great Victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    — Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' Participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    Yang Yong
    October 25, 1950, marks the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers embarking on their mission to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, safeguarding our homeland.
    The war of aggression against Korea launched by U.S. imperialism was its largest-scale local war after World War II. The outcome of this war was crucial not only for the safety of Korea and China but also for the fate of peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, it was of utmost significance that the Korean and Chinese peoples defeated U.S. imperialism on the Korean battlefield. It not only halted the war and shattered the U.S. imperialist's sinister plan to annex Korea and attack China, thus saving peace, but also boosted the confidence of the Korean, Chinese, and world's people in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and in defense of world peace. It not only stripped U.S. imperialism of its disguise, revealing its wolfish nature to the world's people, but also powerfully demonstrated that awakened and united nations cannot be bullied and that the power of the people is invincible. U.S. imperialism, with its atomic bombs, is merely a "paper tiger." The myth that U.S. imperialism is untouchable and unbeatable has been completely shattered.
    (I)
    Even on the eve of the Chinese people's nationwide victory, our great leader Chairman Mao earnestly taught the people to never relax their vigilance against imperialism. He said, "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their defeat on this land of China. They will still collude with each other and use all possible means to oppose the Chinese people. … We must never relax our vigilance against the mad schemes of revenge of the imperialist elements and their running dogs because of victory. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will disarm himself politically and place himself in a passive position." Indeed, as expected, less than a year after the founding of the People's Republic of China, U.S. imperialism brazenly launched a war of aggression against Korea, while simultaneously occupying our territory of Taiwan by armed force. It also manipulated the United Nations to pass resolutions for aggression against Korea, gathered the armies of fifteen satellite countries under the banner of the "United Nations," and launched a large-scale offensive against the Korean people, attempting to annex Korea in one fell swoop and then invade China, in order to realize its ambition of dominating the world. U.S. imperialism mistakenly believed that the young Democratic People's Republic of Korea was vulnerable and that the Chinese people, who had just won victory after a long period of war, would not dare to confront the U.S.
    Contrary to the expectations of U.S. imperialism, the heroic Korean people, correctly led by the Korean Workers' Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung, rose up to resist the U.S. aggressors, dealt heavy blows to the U.S. bandits and their running dogs, and achieved significant victories. Unwilling to accept defeat, the U.S. aggressors hastily mobilized their superior forces and landed at Incheon in mid-September. Ignoring the warnings of the Korean and Chinese people and the opposition of the world's people, they ordered their invading forces to cross the 38th parallel on a large scale, advancing towards the Yalu and Tumen Rivers, directly threatening our border. At the same time, they sent their air force invading Korea to intrude into our northeastern airspace, bomb our cities and towns, and kill our compatriots. By this point, the U.S. imperialists' deliberate conspiracy to expand the war of aggression was completely exposed. The Chinese people were no strangers to this, as it was precisely the old path taken by the Japanese militarists in those years. The Chinese people could no longer tolerate this, and a vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea rapidly unfolded throughout the country.
    U.S. imperialists nakedly exposed their plundering and belligerent wolfish nature through their atrocities. Although they painstakingly stole the signboard of the "United Nations" to cover up their crimes of aggression, it was of no use at all. Who could believe that the U.S. sent its troops across thousands of miles to Korea to kill, set fires, and occupy China's territory of Taiwan out of the necessity for "U.S. security" and "world peace"? It was none other than U.S. imperialism itself that tore off its "peace" mask in front of the world's people and placed the labels of "deadly enemy of peace" and "warmonger" on its own head.
    The thorough exposure of U.S. imperialism's true imperialist colors on the Korean battlefield was very instructive for the Korean, Chinese, and world's people. It clearly told us that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Korean, Chinese, and world's people. Its nature will never change until its death. It is destined to disrupt the cause of the people, and it will never be reconciled to its defeat. This is a lesson that U.S. imperialism forced the Korean, Chinese, and world's people to accept over three years and one month, using a large number of aircraft, artillery, and more than 20 billion U.S. dollars. All peace-loving people will never forget this lesson.
    Today, revisiting the historical experience of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has very important practical significance. It can help us see through the conspiracies of imperialism and reactionaries and help us heighten our vigilance against imperialism. Would the executioners on the Korean battlefield yesterday suddenly lay down their butcher knives and embrace peace today? This is entirely within the realm of common sense. More than seven years have passed since the U.S. signed the Korean Armistice Agreement. It has also been two years since the Chinese People's Volunteers completely withdrew from Korea. However, the U.S. aggressor troops still refuse to leave South Korea to this day, still occupy our territory of Taiwan, and continue to cause trouble in other parts of the world. The actions of U.S. imperialism confirm the consistency of its aggressive nature. If there is any change, it is only that it has become more cunning.
    (II)
    The Chinese people love peace. The joint declaration issued by the democratic parties in our country for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and safeguarding our homeland fully expresses the peaceful will of the Chinese people. The declaration said, "The Chinese people ardently love peace. We have always wanted peace in the past, and we will always want peace in the future. We want peace for China, we want peace for Asia, and we want lasting peace for the whole world and all mankind." Our social system determines that we do not need, cannot, and will not allow ourselves to invade any other country. However, U.S. imperialism regarded our desire for peace as a sign of weakness and ignored the warnings of our government and people. Instead of stopping its aggression and withdrawing its invading forces, it further expanded the war of aggression against Korea and brought the flames of war to the border of Northeast China. The Chinese people, under the guidance of Chairman Mao, have never relaxed their due vigilance against imperialism, never disarmed themselves spiritually in the face of imperialist "peace" deception, and have never been afraid of imperialist war threats. They dared to use just war to extinguish the imperialist war of aggression. At this critical moment concerning the safety of Korea and China, at this critical moment concerning the fate of peace in Asia and the world, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, resolutely sent their outstanding sons and daughters to form the Volunteers, holding high the banner of justice of "Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, Safeguarding Our Homeland," crossing the Yalu River, and fighting alongside the heroic Korean people against the U.S. aggressors. History has proven that this was completely necessary and completely correct.
    Korea and China are separated only by a river, and we are as interdependent as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. The survival of Korea is closely related to the safety of China. The Korean people's heroic resistance against the U.S. aggressors not only defended the independence of their own country but also directly ensured the security of China. The Chinese People's Volunteers going abroad to fight was a proletarian internationalist duty and a just action to safeguard our homeland. Since the U.S. army occupied our Taiwan, invaded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and attacked our northeastern border, and the U.S. aggressors insisted on imposing war on us, we had no choice but to raise the banner of anti-aggression and fight alongside the Korean people against the U.S. aggressors.
    (III)
    The Korean and Chinese peoples soberly estimated that extinguishing the flames of aggression ignited by U.S. imperialism in Korea would be a serious struggle. However, in any case, the U.S. imperialist's offensive must be defeated, and it could be defeated. Because although our enemy had temporary military superiority, its foundation was weak, its front was too long, its rear was too far, its troop strength was insufficient, and the most important thing was that the war it was waging was unjust, extremely unpopular, politically isolated, and its morale was low. We were exactly the opposite. We were a just army, fighting for justice, and the people of the world sympathized with us and stood on our side. Things were exactly like this. The Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, fought side by side, cooperated closely, and with the support of the Korean and Chinese peoples, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the people of the world, overcame all kinds of difficulties. With an overwhelming heroic spirit and dauntless spirit, after three years of arduous struggle, we finally defeated the most ferocious enemy of the world's people—U.S. imperialism—and achieved a great victory.
    The seriousness of the struggle was not only reflected on the battlefield but also fully reflected at the negotiating table. During the war, the Korean and Chinese peoples adhered to a just stand and, with great determination and patience, conducted negotiations with U.S. imperialism for two years and one month, engaging in complex and sharp struggles at the negotiating table. In the armistice negotiations, U.S. imperialism was arrogant and unreasonable, obstructing and undermining the negotiations, and repeatedly absenting itself from meetings. First, under the pretext of so-called "compensation for naval and air superiority," it attempted to extort at the negotiating table what it could not obtain on the battlefield—12,000 square kilometers of land. Then, it clamored that it would "let bombs, cannons, and machine guns debate!" Then, it repeatedly sent aircraft and armed personnel to intrude into the neutral zone, dropping bombs and firing, shooting and killing our on-duty police, using all kinds of threats and intimidation. The rogue nature of imperialism was fully exposed.
    Chairman Mao said: "We want peace, but as long as U.S. imperialism does not abandon its arrogant and unreasonable demands and its conspiracy to expand aggression, the Chinese people are determined to fight alongside the Korean people until the end. This is not because we are bellicose, we are willing to stop the war immediately; the remaining issues will be resolved in the future. But U.S. imperialism is unwilling to do so, so be it, let's fight on. U.S. imperialism is willing to fight for how many years, and we are ready to fight with it for how many years, until U.S. imperialism is willing to give up, until the Korean and Chinese people achieve complete victory." When negotiating with U.S. imperialism, we acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings. On the one hand, we took the negotiations seriously and constantly exposed the U.S. imperialist's conspiracies to delay and undermine the negotiations, striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis. But on the other hand, we did not harbor any illusions about the negotiations, not only did we not relax our vigilance in the slightest, but also gave the enemy's new military offensives a doubled response. It was precisely because we hit the enemy hard and defeated it that it gave up and was finally forced to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement. Facts have proven that when imperialism imposes war on the people, if peace-loving people want to achieve peace, they must resolutely raise the banner of just war against aggression and defeat the aggressors. Only by resolutely resisting and truly hitting the enemy hard can it be possible to stop aggression and defend national independence and world peace.
    The great victory of the Korean and Chinese peoples in resisting U.S. imperialist aggression also proves that the victory or defeat of a war is ultimately not determined by the superiority of technology and equipment, but by the nature of the war and the support of the people. The power of the people is immeasurable, and a nation fighting for justice is invincible; while U.S. imperialism, which considers itself "extremely powerful" and "invincible in the world" and holds atomic bombs in its hands, can be completely defeated. The fact that U.S. imperialism exhausted its strength on the Korean battlefield, using its naval and air superiority and the superiority of its technology and equipment, adopting various cruel tactics, launching offensives of various kinds, and even inhumanly using bacteriological weapons, could not save it from its doomed fate is ironclad proof.
    (IV)
    In the great struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people, as well as our close comrades-in-arms—the Korean People's Army—shared joys and sorrows and fought side by side. The combat friendship and unity formed between the Korean and Chinese peoples in the long-term struggle against a common enemy have been further consolidated and developed. This friendship and unity are forged with blood and are based on the principles of proletarian internationalism and the foundation of Marxism-Leninism. It is unbreakable. This great friendship and unity has been and will always be an important guarantee for us to defeat our common enemies.
    As we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, we sincerely thank the Korean people for their deep and meticulous care for the Chinese Volunteers, as close as brothers. The Korean people, under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, paid a huge price and made a great contribution to resisting U.S. imperialist aggression and striving for victory in the war. They have made immortal contributions to defending world peace. The Korean people's arduous and tenacious fighting spirit and brave and hardworking style have played a huge role in inspiring and educating the vast number of commanders and fighters of the Volunteers. It has been two years since the Chinese People's Volunteers completely withdrew from Korea, but we will never forget the consistent love and care of the Korean Workers' Party, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Korean people for the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    Today, the U.S. aggressor troops still refuse to leave South Korea, continuing to obstruct and undermine the Korean people's peaceful reunification of their homeland, and still occupy our territory of Taiwan. This cannot but arouse the Chinese people's boundless indignation and serious vigilance. No matter what tricks U.S. imperialism may play in the future, as long as it adheres to its policy of aggression and war, insists on being the enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples, and the enemy of the world's people, it will inevitably continue to be resolutely opposed by the Korean and Chinese peoples, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the people of the world. If it dares to risk the condemnation of the world and launch a war, it will inevitably accelerate its own demise.

    抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利
    ——纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战十周年
    杨勇
    1950年10月25日，中国人民志愿军肩负着抗美援朝、保家卫国的伟大使命出国作战，到现在已经十周年了。
    美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争，是它在第二次世界大战后竭尽全力发动的一次规模最大的局部战争。这次战争的结局，不仅关系到朝鲜和中国的安危，而且关系到亚洲和世界和平的命运。因此，朝中人民在朝鲜战场上打败了美帝国主义，意义极其重大。不仅制止了战争，粉碎了美帝国主义并吞朝鲜、进攻中国的罪恶计划，拯救了和平，而且鼓舞了朝中两国和全世界人民反对美帝国主义保卫世界和平的斗争信心；不仅剥下了美帝国主义的画皮，在全世界人民面前露出了它的豺狼面目，而且有力地证明，觉醒了的团结起来了的民族是不可欺侮的，人民的力量是不可战胜的。手里拿着原子弹的美帝国主义不过是一只“纸老虎”，美帝国主义碰不得、打不败的神话，彻底破灭了。
    （一）
    还在中国人民取得全国胜利的前夜，我国人民的伟大领袖毛主席就谆谆教导全国人民务必不要松懈自己对于帝国主义的警惕性。他说：“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的。他们还会要互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法，反对中国人民。……我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动地位。”果然不出所料，中华人民共和国成立还不到一年的时间，美帝国主义就悍然发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，同时武装侵占我国领土台湾，并且操纵联合国通过侵略朝鲜的决议，纠集十五个仆从国家的军队打着“联合国”的旗号，向朝鲜人民大举进攻，妄图一举并吞朝鲜，进而侵略中国，以实现称霸世界的野心。美帝国主义错误地认为：年轻的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是不堪一击的，经过长期战争刚刚获得胜利的中国人民是不敢同美国较量的。
    出乎美帝国主义的意料之外，英雄的朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党和金日成同志的正确领导下，奋起抗击美国侵略者，沉重地打击了美国强盗及其走狗，取得了重大的胜利。美国侵略者不甘心失败，慌忙调集了优势的兵力于9月中旬在仁川登陆，并且不顾朝中人民的警告和世界人民的反对，命令其侵略军大举越过三八线，向鸭绿江和图们江边汹涌逼进，把战争矛头直接指向我国边境。与此同时，并派其侵朝空军侵入我国东北领空，炸我城乡，杀我同胞。至此，美帝国主义者蓄意扩大侵略战争的阴谋已暴露无遗。中国人民对此是毫不陌生的，这正是日本军国主义者当年走过的一条老路。中国人民忍无可忍，一个轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，在全国迅猛地展开起来了。
    美帝国主义者用自己的兽行赤裸裸地暴露了它的掠夺好战的豺狼本性。虽然它煞费苦心地盗用了“联合国”的招牌，为自己的侵略罪行遮羞；但是，这是一点用处也没有的。谁能相信美国派遣自己的军队横渡万里重洋，到朝鲜来杀人放火，侵占中国的领土台湾，是出于“美国安全”和“世界和平”的必要？不是别人，正是美帝国主义自己，在全世界人民面前，撕下了它的“和平”的假面具，在自己的头上插上了“和平死敌”和“战争贩子”的标签。
    美国在朝鲜战场上这样彻底地暴露自己帝国主义的本来面目，对于朝中人民和世界人民，是很有教益的。它明明白白地告诉我们：美帝国主义是朝中人民和世界人民最凶恶的敌人。它的本性是至死不变的。它对待人民的事业，是注定要捣乱的，它对自己的失败是决不甘心的。这是美帝国主义者以三年零一个月的时间，使用大量飞机、大炮和二百亿元以上的美元，强迫朝中两国和全世界人民接受的一课。这一课是所有爱好和平的人民决不会忘记的。
    今天，我们重温抗美援朝斗争的历史经验，有着十分重要的现实意义。它可以帮助我们识破帝国主义和反动派的阴谋，有利于提高我们对帝国主义的警惕。难道昨天朝鲜战场上的刽子手，今天竟会放下屠刀，爱起和平来？这完全是常识以内的事情。美国在朝鲜停战协定上签字到现在七年多了。中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜也两年了。但是，美国侵略军到今天为止，还赖在朝鲜南部不走，还霸占着我国领土台湾，并且在世界的其他地方继续捣乱，美帝国主义的所作所为，证实了它的侵略本质的一贯性，假如说它有什么改变的话，只不过是变得更加狡猾而已。
    （二）
    中国人民是热爱和平的。我国各民主党派为抗美援朝、保家卫国发表的联合宣言，充分表达了中国人民的和平意志。宣言说：“中国人民是酷爱和平的。我们以前一向要和平，我们今后永远要和平。我们要中国的和平，我们要亚洲的和平，我们要全世界全人类的持久和平”。我们的社会制度决定我们不需要、不可能、也不允许去侵犯任何别的国家。但是，美帝国主义把我们的和平愿望看成是软弱可欺的表现，对我国政府和人民的警告置若罔闻，非但不停止侵略，撤走其侵略军，反而进一步扩大侵朝战争，把战火烧到中国东北的边境。在毛主席教导下的中国人民，从来没有松懈对帝国主义应有的警惕，从来没有在帝国主义“和平”欺骗面前解除自己的精神武装，从来不害怕帝国主义的战争威胁，并且敢于用正义战争去扑灭帝国主义的侵略战争。在这关系到朝、中两国安危的紧急时刻里，在这关系到亚洲和世界和平命运的紧急时刻里，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，毅然决然地派遣自己的优秀儿女组成志愿军，高举“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的正义旗帜，跨过鸭绿江，和英雄的朝鲜人民并肩抗击美国侵略者。历史业已证明这是完全必要的，也是完全正确的。
    中朝两国只有一江之隔，我们是唇齿相依、休戚与共。朝鲜的存亡与中国的安危是密切关联的。朝鲜人民英勇抗击美国侵略者，不仅保卫了自己祖国的独立，也直接保障了中国的安全。中国人民志愿军出国作战是无产阶级的国际主义的义务，也是我们保家卫国的正义行动。既然美国军队占领了我国的台湾，侵略了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，打到了我国东北的边疆，美国侵略者硬要把战争强加到我们头上，我们就不能不举起反侵略的旗帜，和朝鲜人民一道，抗击美国侵略者。
    （三）
    朝中两国人民清醒地估计到：要扑灭美帝国主义在朝鲜点燃的侵略战火，是一场严重的斗争。但是，不管怎样，美帝国主义的进攻是必须打败的，而且是能够打败的。因为我们的敌人虽然有着暂时的军事优势，然而，它的基础是虚弱的，它的战线太长，后方太远，兵力不足，而最主要的则是它所进行的战争是非正义的、极端不得人心的，在政治上是孤立的，士气是不高的。我们则完全相反。我们是正义之师，为正义而战，全世界人民都同情我们，都站在我们方面。事情正是如此。中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民军一起，并肩作战，密切配合，在朝中两国人民和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国和世界人民的支援下，克服了种种困难，以压倒一切的英雄气概和大无畏的精神，经过三年艰苦卓绝的斗争，终于打败了全世界人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义，取得了伟大的胜利。
    斗争的严重性，不只表现在战场上，而且也充分表现在谈判桌上。在战争期间，朝中人民坚持正义立场，以极大的坚定性和忍耐精神，同美帝国主义进行了两年零一个月的谈判，在谈判桌上进行了复杂尖锐的斗争。在停战谈判中，美帝国主义蛮横无理，阻挠破坏，拒绝协商，一再逃会。先则以所谓“海空优势的补偿”为借口，妄图在谈判桌上勒索它在战场上得不到的东西——一万二千平方公里的土地；继则扬言要“让炸弹、大炮和机关枪去辩论！”再则多次派飞机和武装人员侵入中立区，投弹射击，枪杀我方值勤警察，百般威胁恫吓，无所不用其极。帝国主义的流氓本性，暴露无遗。
    毛主席说：“我们是要和平的，但是，只要美帝国主义一天不放弃它那种蛮横无理的要求和扩大侵略的阴谋，中国人民的决心就是只有同朝鲜人民一起，一直战斗下去。这不是因为我们好战，我们愿意立即停战；剩下的问题待将来去解决。但美帝国主义不愿意这样做，那么好吧，就打下去，美帝国主义愿意打多少年，我们也就准备跟它打多少年，一直打到美帝国主义愿意罢手的时候为止，一直打到中朝人民完全胜利的时候为止。”在同美帝国主义进行谈判时，我们正是根据毛主席的教导，一方面认真对待谈判，并不断揭露美帝国主义拖延和破坏谈判的阴谋诡计，竭力争取在公平合理的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题。但另一方面对谈判又不抱幻想，不但丝毫不放松自己的警惕，而且给予敌人新的军事进攻以加倍的回击。正由于我们把敌人打痛了，打败了，它这才罢手，并且终于被迫在朝鲜停战协定上签了字。事实证明：当帝国主义把战争强加在人民头上的时候，爱好和平的人民要想得到和平，就必须坚决地举起反侵略的正义战争的旗帜，打败侵略者。只有坚决抵抗，真正把敌人打痛，才有可能制止侵略，保卫民族独立和世界和平。
    朝中人民反抗美帝国主义侵略的伟大胜利还证明：战争的胜败归根到底不是由技术、装备的优劣来决定的，而是由战争的性质和人心向背来决定的。人民的力量是不可估量的，为正义而战的民族是不可战胜的；而自以为是“异常强大”、“举世无敌”，手里拿着原子弹的美帝国主义，则是完全能够打败的。美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上用尽了力气，它利用其海空优势和技术装备的优势，采取了各种残酷的战法，发动了各种名堂的攻势，甚至灭绝人性地使用了细菌武器，都不能挽救其失败的命运，就是铁证。
    （四）
    在伟大的反抗美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民以及我们的亲密战友——朝鲜人民军，同甘共苦，并肩作战。朝中两国人民在长期反对共同敌人的斗争中所形成的战斗友谊和团结，得到了进一步的巩固和发展。这种友谊和团结，是用鲜血凝成的，是建立在无产阶级国际主义的原则和马克思列宁主义思想基础之上的，是牢不可破的。这种伟大的友谊和团结，过去曾经是今后也永远是我们战胜共同敌人的重要保证。
    在纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战十周年的时候，我们衷心地感谢朝鲜人民对中国志愿军的亲如手足的深情的和无微不至的关怀。在朝鲜劳动党和金日成首相正确领导下的朝鲜人民，为反抗美帝国主义的侵略，争取战争的胜利，付出了巨大的代价，作出了伟大的贡献。他们为保卫世界和平，立下了不朽的功勋。朝鲜人民艰苦卓绝的战斗精神和勇敢勤劳的作风，曾经对志愿军的广大指战员起了巨大的鼓舞和教育作用。中国人民志愿军全部撤离朝鲜已经两年了，但是，我们永远忘不了朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军始终如一的爱护和关怀。
    今天，美国侵略军还赖在朝鲜南部不走，继续阻挠和破坏朝鲜人民和平统一自己的祖国，并且还霸占着我国的领土台湾。对此，不能不引起中国人民的无比愤慨和严重的警惕。不管美帝国主义今后还会耍什么花招，只要它坚持侵略和战争政策，坚持与朝中人民为敌，与世界人民为敌，它就必然要继续遭到朝中人民、以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界人民的坚决反对。如果它胆敢冒天下之大不韪，发动战争，就必将加速自己的灭亡。
