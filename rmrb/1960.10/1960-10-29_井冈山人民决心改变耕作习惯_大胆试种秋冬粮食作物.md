Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang Electric Dispatch. The people of Jinggangshan in Jiangxi Province are trial planting autumn and winter grain crops, opening up new avenues for developing agriculture and grain production on a large scale in mountainous areas.

Located more than 1,000 meters above sea level, Jinggangshan has high mountains, cold water, strong winds, heavy fog, and relatively low temperatures. Originally, there was no habit of planting autumn and winter grain crops. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the cadres and masses of Jinggangshan have dared to think and act, successfully trial planting and expanding the planting of double-cropping rice on the mountains, which broadened people's horizons and strengthened their confidence in transforming nature. This year, they decided to further trial plant and expand the planting of grain crops in autumn and winter sowing. The seven production teams of the Heqiao Brigade in the City Commune planted one or two mu of broad beans and peas last year, with a yield of about 80 jin per mu. This year, after summing up the experience of trial planting, they decided to expand the area of winter-sown broad beans and peas to 170 mu.

Cadres and the masses at all levels are planting large areas of experimental fields this year to test autumn and winter sown grain crops. The crops being tested include potatoes, barley, broad beans, peas, and wheat, which has never been grown on Jinggangshan before. The selected experimental fields are spread across mountain peaks, mountain slopes, foothills, terraced fields, paddy fields, ridge fields, cold water fields, deep mud fields, and rocky sandy fields. The trial planting methods include spot sowing, row sowing, and broadcasting, early sowing, late sowing, deep ploughing, and shallow ploughing, in order to obtain experience in various aspects.

At present, key brigades such as Nanshan and Longshi Communes, which are trial planting wheat, have sent special personnel to ditch and drain water in the fields. The "100-mu experimental section" of wheat in the Pai Tou Brigade has made thorough preparations for various sowing tasks, and technology, seeds, and fertilizers have all been implemented. Autumn sowing has already begun in places where work started early, and Longshi and Nanshan Communes have sown more than 1,000 mu of broad beans and peas.

    井冈山人民决心改变耕作习惯
    大胆试种秋冬粮食作物
    新华社南昌电　江西井冈山人民试种秋冬粮食作物，为山区大办农业、大办粮食开拓新的门路。
    拔海一千多米的井冈山上，山高、水冷、风大、雾多、气温较低，原来没有种植秋冬粮食作物的习惯。几年来，在党的领导下，井冈山的干部和群众敢想敢干，在山上试种扩种双季稻成功，给人们打开了眼界，坚定了改造自然的信心。今年，他们决定在秋播冬播中进一步试种扩种粮食作物。市公社河桥大队的七个生产小队，去年各种了一二亩蚕豆、豌豆，亩产达八十斤左右。今年，他们总结试种经验，决定把冬播蚕豆、豌豆的面积扩大到一百七十亩。
    各级干部和群众今年都大种试验田，试验秋播冬播粮食作物。试验的作物有马铃薯、大麦、蚕豆、豌豆，还有井冈山上从来没有种过的小麦。选好的试验田遍布在山峰、山腰、山下、梯田、冲田、垅田、冷水田、深泥田、岩沙田里，试种的方法有点播、条播、撒播，早播、晚播，深耕、浅耕，多种多样，以便取得多方面的经验。
    现在，拿山、砻市等公社试种小麦的重点大队，都派出专人在田间开沟排水。排头大队的小麦“百亩试验段”，各项播种准备工作做得妥妥贴贴，技术、种子、肥料都已落实。动手早的地方秋播已经开始，砻市、拿山公社已经播下蚕豆、豌豆一千多亩。
