    The Tremendous Development of Dance Art in the Past Eleven Years

    After the founding of the People’s Republic of China, with the victory of the democratic revolution, our country entered a new stage of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the development of revolutionary dance art also entered a new period. With the in-depth development of successive political movements and the struggle between the two roads, revolutionary dance has been rapidly disseminated and developed. This is mainly manifested in: the dance creations of many professional groups have more widely used various national folk dance art forms, boldly innovated and developed them, making them suitable for expressing the heroic figures of our new era, greatly promoting the glorious tradition of revolutionary dance art, and producing many excellent works that enthusiastically reflect and sing the revolutionary struggles of the Chinese people in various historical periods and other types of themes, such as: "Eighteen Warriors" reflecting the Long March of the Red Army, "Marching Dance" reflecting the victorious advance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, "Volunteer Army War Song" and "Blasting the Bunker" reflecting the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, "Bow and Arrow Dance" reflecting the Tibetan people's resistance to feudal serfdom, "Long Live the People's Victory," "Hada Dedicated to Chairman Mao," "Red Silk Dance," and "Army Waist Drum," which sing the praises of the Party, Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and express the joyous emotions of the people, "Celebrating the Steel Production of Wuhan Iron and Steel," "Ore Carriers," "Red Flag Group Dance," and "Little Zhang's Transformation," which express the heroic spirit of the working class in the Great Leap Forward, "People's Commune is Good" and "Wheat Harvest," which sing the praises of the people's communes and bumper harvests, "New Car and Old Car" and "On the Way to the People's School," which reflect technological innovation and cultural revolution, "Passenger's Home" and "Serving in the Fields," which reflect the new relationship between people, Mongolian dances reflecting the new life of various ethnic groups, "Ordos," "Herding Horses," and "Milkmaids," Tibetan dances "Tibetan Cavalry Dance," "Reba on the Grassland," "Night of Harvest," and "Friendship," Uygur dances "Melon Planting Dance," "Grape Picking," "Lach," and "Lazy Man," Korean dances "Farmers' Dance," "Fan Dance," and "Water Carrying Dance," Yi dances "Axi Jumping Moon," "Happy Nuosu," and "Liangshan Wine Dance," Miao dances "Happy Miao Family," Dai dances "Peacock Dance" and "G赶摆," Li dances "March 3rd," Ewenki dances "Solon Dance," Oroqen dances "Oroqen Dance," Yao dances "Yao Wedding Dance," as well as "Lotus Dance," "Tea Picking and Catching Butterflies," "Mr. Dongguo," "Pulling Radishes," "Running Donkey," "Spring Trip to Tea Mountain," "Hero Dance," "Sword Dance," "Walking in the Rain," "Flower Drum Dance," "Flowers and Youth," and many other relatively excellent programs, showing a prosperous and thriving situation in our dance creation.

    China is a multi-ethnic country, and the dances of each ethnic group have their own national style and characteristics. Under the guidance of the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," Chinese dance workers have constantly struggled against various bourgeois national nihilist ideas and conservative ideas in order to critically inherit and promote the excellent traditions of dance art of all ethnic groups in our country. Extensive work has been carried out in the excavation, collection, sorting, and innovation of national folk dance heritage, and a large-scale mass movement has been formed in a certain period, which has achieved great results and opened up a broad road for the nationalization and popularization of dance art in our country. Since the founding of the country, one or two thousand kinds of national and folk dances with different themes and different forms have been excavated and sorted out, and many of these dances have been processed and adapted and have become regular repertoire programs.

    In recent years, China's ballet art has developed rapidly. In addition to the general song and dance troupes engaging in ballet creation and performance, professional teams performing ballet works have gradually grown. And a batch of excellent repertoires have been accumulated, and more than 50 works have been created since the Great Leap Forward.

    China's ballet creation inherits the fighting tradition of China's revolutionary literature and art, and directly reflects revolutionary struggles and contemporary heroic figures in creation. Many large, medium, and small-scale excellent ballet such as "Riding the Wind and Waves to Liberate Hainan," "Luo Shengjiao," "Flag," "Mother is Calling," "Rather Die Than Submit," "Young Patriot," and "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" have emerged. The large-scale ballets "Five Red Clouds," "Butterfly Lovers," "Lola Girl," and the small ballet "Immortal Warrior" emerged in the Second Literary and Art Performance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in 1959, reaching a new level. These modern-themed ballet works express the revolutionary struggle directly under the leadership of the Party, express the most revolutionary and advanced ideological consciousness of the people in the new era, express the new people of communism, and have high ideological and educational significance. Some ballets, such as "Small Sword Society," reflect the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal armed struggle in 1853-1855, which is of educational significance to the Chinese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism today. Excellent ballet works adapted from folk stories and legends with anti-feudalism, such as "Baolian Lantern," "Fish Beauty," "Shi Yi Cuts Wood," and "Robbing the Bride," show the diversity of themes and forms of Chinese ballet creation.

    Recently, ballets that actively reflect socialist construction and sing the praises of heroic figures in construction are being produced in large quantities. The Pinglu Incident, the Makou Incident, and heroic figures with communist style such as Xiang Xiuli, Xu Xuehui, and Liu Wenxue have been expressed in ballets; and ballets reflecting the moving deeds of the heroes of Mount Everest have also been produced. Other moving events in the people's commune movement have also been widely adopted by ballets. Especially in the recent propaganda week against the U.S. imperialist aggression, resolutely liberating Taiwan, and defending world peace, ballets and song and dance skits against U.S. imperialism have appeared in large numbers, which shows that dance workers attach importance to expressing modern themes, which is very valuable.

    The above-mentioned ballet works reflecting the Chinese people's struggle life and ideological emotions are mostly created by seriously inheriting the excellent heritage of national dance, music, and opera, striving to learn from foreign ballet experience, and innovating. Certain achievements have been made in exploring the road of creating a new type of national ballet. Many ballet works have distinct national characteristics in style, profound expressiveness, can reflect relatively rich life content, and have become forms that the masses love to see and hear.

    In recent years, under the guidance and help of Soviet experts, outstanding achievements have been made in learning and introducing the experience of Soviet ballet art. The performance of ballet works such as "Swan Lake" and "Le Corsaire" has played a beneficial role in our national ballet creation activities. The young ballet dancers are growing up very quickly under the encouragement of the Party. The performance of several ballets has a high level, reflecting the soaring enthusiasm of our dance art workers under the leadership of the Party.

    Since the founding of the country, the amateur dance creation of workers, peasants and soldiers has developed greatly, and many excellent works with different themes and styles have emerged.

    Among the creations of the peasants, there are works such as "People's Commune Flowers Bloom" and "Corn Acceptance" which praise the people's commune and the bumper harvest of agriculture, and works such as "Hui Women Lock the Dragon" which express the liberation of women's labor force and show incomparable vitality. Among the creations of the soldiers, there are works such as "Morning of the East China Sea" and "Night of the Reservoir" which express the soldiers' defense of the motherland and participation in socialist construction, and works such as "Consolation on the Position" which express the combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. In the creation, the masses have created many new expression techniques and forms in order to fully express new content and new emotions.

    Especially valuable is that in the National Staff and Workers' Literary and Art Performance held in May this year, a prominent and clear characteristic appeared in the field of mass dance creation, that is, it reflected the spiritual outlook of the Chinese working class in the new era from different aspects and shaped a brand-new image of workers. Through these images, the features of our heroic era are vividly expressed, and the labor of the workers is enthusiastically praised. Programs such as "Iron and Steel Red Flag Class", "Hero Miner", "Clever Girl", "Lumberjack Dance", and "When Going to the Ridge" all express the labor enthusiasm of steel workers, coal miners, textile workers, and forestry workers through dance art. Their performances are so bold, strong, and powerful, with a simple and fresh breath, and at the same time so beautiful, so imaginative and full of poetry, making people feel the sublimity and greatness of labor. The proletarian aesthetic concept is fully expressed in these programs. Many excellent dance programs give the audience a huge inspiring power, stimulating people's revolutionary will to constantly struggle for a better tomorrow.

    The popularization, prosperity, and innovation of mass dance activities truly embodies the correct policy of combining popularization with improvement and combining professional with amateur. Mass dance activities have been improved and developed in quality and quantity. At the same time, on the basis of improvement, it has rapidly spread to the broad masses. National professional dance workers have played an active role in carrying out mass dance creation and activities. In the process of tutoring activities, they learn from the masses on the one hand, and absorb the new factors that constantly appear in mass creation to enrich their own artistic practice. At the same time, they also give the masses great help in professional knowledge and artistic experience. They cultivate artistic talents for the masses, guide their creation and performance, and help them enrich their artistic knowledge and improve their theoretical cultivation. This process of close combination, mutual promotion, and mutual improvement between professional and amateur has enabled mass and professional dance activities to achieve great achievements.

    Since the founding of the country, the professional dance team has grown unprecedentedly, which cannot be compared with before liberation. Before liberation, the number of truly professional dance workers and dance troupes was very few, but today there are about 200 professional song and dance performance groups and 5,000 to 6,000 professional dance workers nationwide. Under the guidance of the Party's wise national policy, professional dance teams of various ethnic minorities have grown up. Among the national professional song and dance groups, there are 82 professional ethnic song and dance troupes.

    The Great Leap Forward in dance also shows the development of dance art education. In 1954, there was only one dance school. Since the Great Leap Forward, due to the great development of socialist construction, almost every province has a dance major or dance school. After the teaching reform movement, the dance education career resolutely implemented the policy of serving proletarian politics with education and combining with labor production, and further implemented the Party's leadership over the dance education career. Under the Party's training and education, we have begun to establish a young teaching staff with a certain political level and teaching ability. They shoulder the glorious and arduous task of cultivating a group of all-round developed proletarian dance cadres who are both red and expert for the Party and the people.

    From the above achievements, we have gained two of the most profound experiences:

    First of all, we have realized that the fundamental reason why our dance career has achieved rapid development and dance work has achieved victory is: resolutely implement the leadership of the Party, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction, and resolutely implement the policy of dance art serving workers, peasants and soldiers, serving socialist cause and letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend, and weeding through the old to bring forth the new. Practice has proved that this is the only correct path. Our dance art workers must unite more closely under the banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and advance firmly and bravely!

    Secondly, the broad masses of dance workers adhere to putting politics in command, adhere to going deep into life, participating in labor, and combining with workers, peasants and soldiers, transforming their thinking, and establishing a proletarian world outlook, which is the ideological foundation and driving force for promoting the great development of dance work, the great prosperity of dance creation, and the great innovation of dance art. It is especially important to mention that the mass line is implemented in the dance work. On the one hand, a large-scale mass dance creation activity has been carried out nationwide, and the broad masses of workers, peasants and soldiers have participated in dance creation and performance activities. On the other hand, in the artistic practice of the professional team, the mass line is also resolutely implemented, so that the collective creation of professional choreographers and actors is combined, and personal creation is combined with mass wisdom. Inspired by this new ideology and new atmosphere, it has brought about a revolutionary spirit of breaking superstitions and daring to innovate and create in creation, and brought about the spirit of working hard and striving for improvement in artistic practice. Dance creation, performance, theory, research and other aspects have been greatly improved, making dance a great achievement.

    The Struggle on the Ideological Front of Dance Art

    Our socialist dance career has achieved great achievements in all aspects, but the road to development is not smooth sailing. Because literature and art are the outposts on the ideological front, they always most keenly reflect the situation of class struggle. The deeper the socialist revolution, the more clearly the struggle between the two roads is reflected in literature and art. In the dance career, we have been constantly fighting against various bourgeois erroneous viewpoints.

    First of all, in dance creation, we have fundamental differences with certain arguments in the dance world on the question of whether or not to express revolutionary history and the life of realistic struggle, and whether or not these themes can be expressed. We believe that the essence of this issue is whether dance art should serve the workers, peasants and soldiers and how to serve the workers, peasants and soldiers, which must be clarified.

    Practice has proved that dance art can fully express the revolutionary struggle of the workers, peasants and soldiers, and will surely exert its greater power in this regard in the future. Our proletarian revolutionary dance art not only dares to express major events in modern life, but also continuously improves its ideological level and artistic skills in practice, and has achieved great achievements. Looking back at our dance creation, we can list many works to illustrate the achievements of dance art in this regard. The revolutionary themes expressed in our dance art almost touch on all aspects of revolutionary history and modern life in the past century. For example, in the ballet "Small Sword Society," the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal armed struggle a hundred years ago is vividly reflected. As for the themes of revolutionary armed struggle carried out by all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, they appear more commonly in ballets, such as "Five Red Clouds," "Butterfly Lovers," and so on. The ballets "Immortal Warrior" and "Luo Shengjiao," and the dance "Blasting the Bunker" have shaped the heroic images of internationalist soldiers in the just struggle against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea. In addition, dances such as "General Becomes a Soldier" and "Commune Canteen" which reflect the new people and new things since the Great Leap Forward are even more common. Recently, the emergence of ballets reflecting the Pinglu Incident, the Makou Incident, and the moving deeds of the heroes of Mount Everest further shows how rich our dance art is in the atmosphere of the times.

    All this shows that revolutionary dance art, like other sister arts, has a clear sense of the times and revolution in content, and can actively reflect revolutionary history and the life of realistic struggle, so as to educate the people, inspire the people, and promote the progress of the times.

    However, not everyone agrees with this view. Some people, starting from the bourgeois theory of human nature and the concepts of aestheticism in dance and ballet, say that "dance is the expression of personal sorrow and happiness," "ballet is only suitable for expressing myths, fantasies and love themes," and "love is the eternal theme of ballet." Or abstractly say that "the characteristic of dance is beauty," fundamentally denying that dance art is a reflection of a certain social life and a weapon of class struggle. Starting from this bourgeois artistic point of view, they further believe that dance "is not suitable for expressing the content of revolutionary struggle and realistic themes." Some people even think that using dance to reflect the real revolutionary struggle, "the stage is either full of yellow military uniforms or blue uniforms, tattered, without color; they are either fighting or laboring, neither beautiful nor poetic." Others said: "The steelworkers in steelmaking clothes are as ugly as they can be on the stage!" Said "expressing the image of peasants is not beautiful." They believe that those dances that serve politics and express realistic themes are "temporary" and "short-lived." And only the so-called purely "beautiful" "lyrical dance" is "immortal." This argument is very harmful. It fundamentally negates the task of dance expressing the workers, peasants and soldiers and their great struggle life, and violates the correct road of revolutionary dance art serving proletarian politics and serving the workers, peasants and soldiers. And absurdly using a bourgeois hateful attitude to talk about workers, peasants and soldiers is intolerable.

    Our disagreement does not lie in abstractly discussing whether dance art should express "beauty" and "poetry," and whether it can express myths, fantasies, and love themes; but in how to recognize "beauty" and "poetry," express the "beauty" and "poetry" of what people, and use what point of view to express what kind of myths, fantasies, and love themes.

    People who hold this kind of bourgeois artistic thought will even openly declare: "Dance can only express emotions, not reason." What they mean by "can't" is actually "shouldn't." This idea seems to be a more absurd development of the idea that "ballet is only suitable for expressing myths, fantasies, and love." They not only oppose expressing the life of realistic struggle, but even when expressing myths, fantasies, and love, they also believe that they cannot express reason and oppose the decisive role of world outlook in dance creation. We cannot imagine that there will be an emotion in art that does not have reason and thought as its basis. In fact, people cannot exist apart from social life. People's emotions are the expression of certain social relations and ideological viewpoints. Therefore, people's emotions are not determined by people's "instinct," but by his social life practice. In class society, it is determined by social class relations. No matter what kind of emotion it is, in different eras and different classes, it has different social content, different ideological basis, and must be expressed through concrete social life. Therefore, the generation of any kind of emotion, whether consciously or unconsciously, is based on reason and thought and has clear class nature. Abstract emotions do not exist. The so-called "dance" of the crazy, erotic, and ugly such as "hula hoop dance" is precisely the reflection of the decadent bourgeois decadent emotions. The Chinese "Red Silk Dance" expresses the thoughts and feelings of the Chinese people who love the new life. The point of view that denies that dance can express reason is actually advocating an emotion that has no class nature. Because there is no reason, that is to say, there is no thought, and there can be no class analysis. In this way, emotions can only have the distinction of abstract "personal sorrow and happiness," without class distinctions; human beings can have a so-called "common human nature" and can have trans-class "emotions" or "love." This point of view of "human nature theory" that explains dance characteristics and various social phenomena with abstract "common human nature" and "human love" is a prominent manifestation of the reactionary revisionist point of view.

    On the question of what themes dance expresses, some people also inappropriately exaggerate the artistic characteristics of dance, one-sidedly emphasizing that the expressiveness of dance has limitations, and saying that many realistic struggles of workers, peasants and soldiers and revolutionary historical themes cannot be expressed. This "theory of theme limitation" is also a manifestation of not being enthusiastic about dance expressing the struggle life of workers, peasants and soldiers. In addition, there is an erroneous argument of "theory of no primary or secondary themes," which believes that "where there is life, there is dance," and all life phenomena can be turned into dance, actually equating life and dance completely.

    From the above-mentioned different opinions, it is not difficult to see that in the field of dance art, the question of whether dance should and can express the struggle life of workers, peasants and soldiers is the key issue in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Although the people who hold these erroneous viewpoints are a very small number, their influence cannot be ignored.

    Of course, we attach importance to major themes of revolutionary history and realistic struggle, but it does not mean that excellent works can be produced as long as major themes are selected. We believe that to produce great works, the selection of themes is of course very important, but more important is to use the correct standpoint and viewpoint, and the correct creative method to deal with these themes; we need to use a strong spirit of the times to correctly express the rich life, and strive to portray the vivid and lively images of workers, peasants and soldiers. Because major events in revolutionary history and realistic life are always linked to the fate of the people, and the common fate of the people is expressed through typical characters, therefore, if the image of heroic figures of an era cannot be better expressed in dance creation, the spiritual outlook of an era cannot be better expressed. In addition, in this regard, we must also pay special attention to the budding of new things. They may still be a minority today and may still be very naive, but they are like the rising sun, the dawn of life, and have a bright and splendid future. We must enthusiastically praise our era, praise the great achievements of the working people, praise the growth of new things, and strive to master the method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, so that the high degree of ideological and artistic nature of the works can be perfectly combined.

    Our era is an era full of revolutionary ideals and revolutionary optimism. In this unprecedented and rapid socialist construction, the people are in high spirits, fighting spirit, and full of soaring enthusiasm. Everywhere is full of the heroic spirit of bowing the mountains and letting the rivers pass. They have completed the arduous democratic revolution and socialist revolution with socialist ideals, and today they are carrying out the great socialist construction under the encouragement of higher communist ideals. Today's ideals are tomorrow's reality, and tomorrow there will be higher ideals to encourage us to move forward. This is our spirit of the times, this is our fighting style. Faced with this heroic era full of revolutionary spirit, literature and art must also find a creative method that can adapt to the spirit of this era, in order to produce excellent works with rich content and profound thought. The artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism is precisely the creative principle put forward by Chairman Mao to meet the needs of the times most, which is another major contribution of Chairman Mao to Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic theory. In order to better express our great era, and more concentratedly and typically portray the spiritual qualities of workers, peasants and soldiers, so that our dance can not only reflect today's reality, but also be full of revolutionary ideals, and not only can express today, but also can show the victorious tomorrow, we must strive to learn to master the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, and strive to improve our creative level and create excellent dance works worthy of our era.

    We emphasize that revolutionary dance should reflect revolutionary history and the life of realistic struggle, and at the same time emphasize that on the premise of the consistency of political direction, we advocate the diversity of styles, forms, genres and themes. In recent years, dance art creation has presented an unprecedented flourishing situation, which proves the correctness of the Party's literary and artistic policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend, and weeding through the old to bring forth the new.

    From the perspective of developing the expressive ability of dance art, our dance can not only vividly and profoundly express huge themes, warriors in revolutionary struggles, and heroes in production labor; at the same time, it is also good at expressing a certain artistic conception and a certain fantasy in people's upward life. We must expand the expressive ability of dance art, not narrow its expressive ability. It is precisely those who believe that "dance can only express love, fantasy, and myth" or "dance can only express personal sorrow and happiness," etc., are all viewpoints that limit the expressive ability of dance art to a very small range.

    The reason why revolutionary dance can be loved by the broad masses is not only because its content has a high degree of ideology, but also because it has a distinct mass style and national form that the people love to see and hear. Our dance art must be further nationalized and popularized. That is to say, in the new era and new situation, dance art must boldly innovate on the basis of inheriting and learning from Chinese and foreign dance art heritage, and create the newest and most beautiful dance with national characteristics of our proletariat to meet the growing needs of the people's cultural life, strive for a wider range of the masses, and climb the peak of world art. Nationalization and popularization are not only issues of dance form and technology, but also related to the principle of serving whom and how to serve, the mass viewpoint of revolutionary dance workers, and the attitude towards Chinese and foreign dance heritage.

    Our dance expresses the life, thoughts and feelings of the people. The living habits and ways of expressing thoughts and feelings of the people have national characteristics. Due to this characteristic and the influence of traditional culture and art life, the people have also formed a unique habit of appreciation for art. Of course, this habit of appreciation is not immutable, it is gradually changing with the development of social politics, economy and cultural life. Since our dance is to serve the people, we must always understand this situation, and create national styles in art according to the people's love and needs, so that the high ideological content can be highly combined with the perfect art forms that the masses love to see and hear.

    People who hold bourgeois artistic viewpoints have the opposite attitude to this question. They are accustomed to treating dance creation with an individualistic attitude, only emphasizing personal artistic taste, not paying attention to the people's appreciation habits, not considering whether the people love it or understand it, only caring to create some things that the people do not understand and do not like under the banner of "artistic personality," and also thinking that their things are good, and the people do not like it, but it is a matter of time. The so-called "the higher the artistic quality, the fewer the number of people who understand it, the more they don't understand it, the more they want to perform it. The audience is disgusted the first time they see it, suspicious the second time, and intoxicated the third time. This is the arduous road of the artist." It should be said that this point of view is completely wrong. According to this theory, artists do not have to contact the masses and learn from the masses. He can regard his personal artistic taste as higher than everything else, and can only let the masses accommodate himself, and cannot transform his art according to the masses' love and needs. This point of view is a typical bourgeois point of view of "transforming the masses" and is diametrically opposed to the requirements of nationalization and popularization, and is therefore very harmful.

    The fundamental spirit of the issue of nationalization and popularization of dance art lies in striving to achieve "the Chinese style and Chinese style that are fresh, lively, and loved by the Chinese people" as pointed out by Chairman Mao 18 years ago. Nationalization is the issue of critically inheriting the old traditions and creating new national forms, national styles, and national traditions; popularization is the issue of mass viewpoint and mass style, and the two are combined and linked to each other. To this end, to achieve nationalization and popularization, the key lies in strengthening the mass viewpoint of dance workers, going deep into the life of struggle, understanding the people, learning from the people, transforming their own thinking, and combining their own feelings with the feelings of the people, and also enthusiastically and actively expressing the wishes of the people. If you look down on the people and your feelings are incompatible with the people, then there is no way to talk about the nationalization and popularization of dance art.

    We have always attached importance to the traditions of national and folk dance art, and have always emphasized the work of excavation, collection, sorting, and processing of national and folk dances, and have continuously struggled against various erroneous ideas in the work process according to Chairman Mao's scientific analysis and wise instructions on traditional culture. Through ideological struggle, a climax of excavation, collection, sorting, and processing of songs and dances of all ethnic groups, folk songs and dances, and classical songs and dances has been set off across the country, achieving great achievements.

    We have been constantly fighting against the bourgeois nihilistic view of traditional art. They mistakenly regard national and folk dance art as feudal and backward things, and take a sweeping attitude. This attitude is also linked to the attitude of blindly worshiping the West, because since they believe that the traditional culture and art of their own nation are dross, they can only use Western things in an all-round way. This point of view is completely incompatible with the mental state of the Chinese people who have stood up.

    At the same time, we have also fought against some conservative ideas and retrogressive ideas, and encouraged the spirit of innovation and creation in art. In the process of inheriting and innovating national and folk dance art, we also encourage the sorting and research of ancient Chinese dance, and absorb its useful elements to serve the people today. However, since ancient dance has been submerged for a long time, and most of the legends and written materials have been tampered with by the feudal ruling class, and are attached with many feudal moral and ethical concepts, it is particularly necessary to maintain a keen proletarian sense of smell and carefully analyze them with the viewpoint of historical materialism. We cannot distinguish between essence and dross, let alone indulge in those theories full of feudal ethical concepts and be unable to extricate ourselves. In creation, on the one hand, we affirm the practice of using ancient music and dance materials to create new dances, which may also produce good dance works. At the same time, we resolutely oppose the use of ancient music and dance to spread the seclusive thoughts and feudal consciousness of the literati class.

    Learning, introducing, and performing foreign dances and ballets are mainly for enriching the cultural life of the Chinese people, exchanging experience, learning and absorbing their useful things, and enriching our own dance creation. In the past, we have introduced a large number of excellent foreign folk dances and some ballet works, and we have indeed learned a lot from them; we will continue to introduce and learn in the future. However, when learning from foreign dances and ballets, we should also be selective, and we should analyze and criticize in the introduction and learning.

    How to learn from the creative experience of foreign dances, learn to use the expressive forms of foreign dances, transform and develop them, and nationalize them so that they can better express the struggle life of the Chinese people is a major topic for our dance workers today. Of course, some achievements have also been made in this regard, and some experience has been gained, but more efforts need to be made, and more exploration and experiments need to be carried out in order to achieve greater achievements.

    New Tasks for Dance Workers

    The achievements of revolutionary dance art under the leadership of the Party and under the glorious illumination of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought are tremendous. We have accumulated rich experience, established a glorious fighting tradition, and embarked on the firm road of developing and prospering socialist and communist dance art.

    Looking forward to our bright future, and based on the needs of the current socialist revolution and construction cause and the broad masses of the people, we propose the following tasks:

    1. To prosper dance creation, and actively create and perform more and better works that are loved by the broad masses and combine a high degree of ideology with perfect art forms, is our primary task. Our dance creation must strive to master the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, resolutely implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new, create diverse themes, forms and styles of dance works, and complete the glorious task of improving the people's communist ideological awareness and moral qualities.

    It is necessary to further carry out theoretical research work, strengthen creative criticism, strengthen the summary of artistic experience, so as to better promote creation and encourage the spirit of artistic innovation.

    2. We must thoroughly launch a struggle against modern revisionism and all bourgeois literary and artistic thoughts in the field of dance art and among all our dance workers, resolutely criticize the bourgeois pacifism and hypocritical humanitarianism, and expose those who attempt to reconcile class contradictions, negate class struggle, thereby dispersing the people's vigilance and fighting will, and blurring the various fallacies of the understanding of the reactionary nature of imperialism and the bourgeoisie. We must resolutely defend Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line in our artistic development direction and concrete artistic practice.

    3. Continue to vigorously go deep into the excavation, sorting and innovation of our national folk traditional dance heritage. We cannot be satisfied with the existing achievements in this work, we should carry it out in a more planned and in-depth manner, and oppose the idea that the previous excavation and sorting work is almost done, and cannot see the richness of the national folk heritage and the new factors of continuous creation and development of the people. At the same time, we should also earnestly study and learn from the excellent dance art of foreign countries.

    4. Further vigorously carry out mass dance activities, guide and promote the creation and performance of mass dances, and push dance activities to a new climax. Professional dance workers should often go directly into the masses to guide mass dance activities, help them improve, cultivate talents in dance activities, and take the promotion of mass dance movement as their important task. At the same time, they should earnestly learn from the masses, attach importance to the important experience and revolutionary spirit of innovation of national and folk dance in reflecting new life and expressing new characters in the creation of the masses, and use it as the nourishment of their own creative practice. In this way, through the further development, popularization, innovation and improvement of mass activities, we will implement the policy of combining popularization with improvement, combining professional with amateur, and fully mobilize the two huge forces of professional and amateur, twist them into a rope, and push dance art creation and activities to a new climax.

    5. Strengthen the work of the Dance Association. The Dance Association must unite the dance workers of the whole country more closely under the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, help them go deep into the struggle life of the masses, participate in labor training, transform their thinking, work hard to study, and strengthen artistic practice.

    In order to better shoulder the above-mentioned tasks, first of all, we must diligently study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong's works, and establish a communist world outlook. Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought has incisively solved a series of principled issues in literature and art with the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism, and is a great development of Marxist-Leninist artistic theory. Our dance workers must often link with reality and repeatedly study, and strive to be able to grasp its spirit to guide our dance art practice and development.

    Dance art workers must actively participate in physical labor by going to the mountains, going to the countryside, and going to the factories, go to the life of struggle, and go to the masses. In actual exercise, closely combine with the masses, transform their world outlook and thoughts and feelings, and make themselves truly proletarian dance art workers who are truly laborized. Going deep into the life of workers, peasants and soldiers and participating in labor training are no exceptions for all dance art workers. We must oppose the erroneous idea of some people who overemphasize the technical nature of dance and belittle participation in labor. Of course, the way of labor training for dance actors should be properly arranged according to specific circumstances, and should not be generalized.

    With a correct world outlook and thoughts and feelings, and with rich life experience, we must also have rich artistic cultivation and artistic skills in order to better create works with a high degree of ideology and artistry. Our dance workers must improve our artistic cultivation, conscientiously study the professional knowledge of each department of art, and develop the habit of working hard to learn and constantly improve skills. We should also improve our literary and artistic level and enrich our historical knowledge. Dance workers should be artistic workers with a high level of culture. This aspect is especially important for many of our young comrades engaged in dance work.

    All the facts in the past 11 years have shown that our achievements have been fully achieved under the leadership of the Party. The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for the forward development and prosperity of our dance career. Therefore, we must resolutely implement the Party's leadership over the dance career. Every dance worker must become a proletarian literary and artistic fighter who listens to the Party.

    在毛泽东文艺思想的旗帜下，争取舞蹈艺术的更大繁荣！
    ——在中国舞蹈艺术研究会第二届会员代表大会上的报告摘要
    周巍峙
    十一年来舞蹈艺术事业的巨大发展
    中华人民共和国成立以后，随着民主革命的胜利，我国进入了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新阶段，革命舞蹈艺术的发展也进入了一个新的时期。随着历次政治运动和两条道路斗争的深入开展，革命舞蹈得到了迅速的传播与发展。主要表现在：在许多专业团体的舞蹈创作中，更广泛地运用了民族民间各种舞蹈艺术形式，大胆地加以革新和发展，使它适宜于表现我们新时代的英雄人物，大大发扬了革命舞蹈艺术的光荣传统，出现了许多热情地反映和歌颂中国人民在各个历史时期的革命斗争和其他各类题材的优秀作品，如：反映红军长征的《十八勇士》，反映中国人民胜利进军的《进军舞》，反映抗美援朝的《志愿军战歌》、《炸碉堡》，反映西藏人民反抗封建奴隶制度的《弓箭舞》，歌颂党、歌颂毛主席、歌颂中国人民解放军、表现人民欢乐情绪的《人民胜利万岁》、《披毡献给毛主席》、《红绸舞》、《陆军腰鼓》，表现大跃进中工人阶级英雄气概的《庆祝武钢出钢》、《背矿员》、《红旗组舞》、《小张的转变》，歌颂人民公社和农业大丰收的《人民公社好》、《小麦丰收》，反映技术革新和文化革命的《新车与旧车》、《去民校的路上》，反映人与人之间新的关系的《乘客之家》、《服务在田间》，反映各族人民新生活的蒙族舞蹈《鄂尔多斯》、《牧马》、《挤奶员》，藏族舞蹈《藏民骑兵舞》、《草原上的热巴》、《丰收之夜》、《友谊》，维吾尔族舞蹈《种瓜舞》、《摘葡萄》、《拉克》、《懒汉》，朝鲜族舞蹈《农乐舞》、《扇舞》、《顶水舞》，彝族舞蹈《阿细跳月》、《快乐的诺苏》、《凉山酒舞》，苗族舞蹈《欢乐的苗家》，傣族舞蹈《孔雀舞》、《赶摆》，黎族舞蹈《三月三》，鄂温克族的《索伦舞》，鄂伦春族的《鄂伦春舞》，瑶族舞蹈《瑶族婚礼舞》，以及《荷花舞》、《采茶扑蝶》、《东郭先生》、《拔萝卜》、《跑驴》、《春行茶山》、《英雄舞》、《剑舞》、《走雨》、《花鼓舞》、《花儿与少年》等等许多比较优秀的节目，显示了我们舞蹈创作的一片欣欣向荣的兴旺局面。
    我国是一个多民族的国家，各个民族的舞蹈都有着自己的民族风格与特色。我国舞蹈工作者在百花齐放、推陈出新的方针指导下，为了批判地继承与发扬我国各族人民的舞蹈艺术优秀传统，曾经不断地和各种资产阶级的民族虚无主义思想和保守思想进行斗争。在挖掘、收集、整理、革新民族民间舞蹈遗产方面进行了广泛的工作，在一定时期并且形成了一个大规模的群众运动，得到了巨大的成绩，为我国舞蹈艺术的民族化、群众化开辟了广阔的道路。建国以来，已经发掘、整理出一、二千种不同题材、不同形式的民族、民间舞蹈，其中许多舞蹈都已经过加工改编，成为经常演出的保留节目。
    我国的舞剧艺术，近年来得到了迅速的发展。除一般的歌舞团进行了舞剧创作和演出以外，演出舞剧作品的专业队伍也逐渐成长起来。并且积累了一批优秀的剧目，仅仅大跃进以来就创作了五十多部作品。
    我国的舞剧创作，继承了我国革命文艺的战斗传统，在创作上直接反映了革命斗争和当代的英雄人物。出现了像《乘风破浪解放海南》、《罗盛教》、《旗》、《母亲在召唤》、《宁死不屈》、《少年爱国者》、《王贵与李香香》等等许多大、中、小型的优秀舞剧。1959年第二届中国人民解放军文艺会演中涌现了大型舞剧《五朵红云》、《蝶恋花》、《篓拉姑娘》和小型舞剧《不朽的战士》等作品，达到了新的水平。在这些现代题材的舞剧作品里，表现了在党直接领导下的革命斗争，表现了新时代人民群众中最革命、最先进的思想意识，表现了共产主义的新人，具有着较高的思想性与教育意义。有些舞剧，如《小刀会》反映了我国人民在1853—1855年的反帝反封建的武装斗争，对于我国人民今天反对美帝国主义的斗争来说，是有着教育意义的。取材于具有反对封建的民间故事、传说而创作的优秀舞剧作品，有《宝莲灯》、《鱼美人》、《石义砍柴》、《抢亲》等，显示了我国舞剧创作题材和形式的多样性。
    最近，积极反映社会主义建设和歌颂建设中的英雄人物的舞剧正在大量产生，平陆事件、马口事件以及像向秀丽、徐学惠、刘文学等这些有共产主义风格的英雄人物已在舞剧中得到表现；反映珠穆朗玛峰登山英雄的动人事迹的舞剧也已产生。其他如人民公社化运动中的许多动人事件也广泛为舞剧所采用。特别在最近反对美帝国主义侵略，坚决解放台湾，保卫世界和平的宣传周中，反对美帝国主义的舞剧和歌舞活报大量出现，这都说明了舞蹈工作者对表现现代题材的重视，是十分可贵的。
    上述这些反映我国人民斗争生活和思想情感的舞剧作品，大都是认真地继承了民族舞蹈、音乐、戏曲的优秀遗产，努力向外国舞剧经验学习并进行了革新而创造出来的，在探索创造新型的民族舞剧的道路上，已取得一定的成绩。其中不少舞剧作品在风格上具有了鲜明的民族特点，深刻的表现力，能够反映比较丰富的生活内容，成了群众所喜闻乐见的形式。
    近年来，在苏联专家的指导和帮助下，在学习和介绍苏联舞剧艺术经验方面做出了出色的成绩，芭蕾舞剧《天鹅湖》、《海侠》等作品的上演，对我们民族舞剧创作活动起了有益的作用。年轻的芭蕾演员们在党的鼓舞下，成长得很快，几个舞剧的演出有着很高的水平，体现了我们舞蹈艺术工作者在党的领导下的冲天干劲。
    建国以来，工农兵群众的业余舞蹈创作大大发展，出现了许多不同题材不同风格的优秀作品。
    农民们的创作中，出现了歌颂人民公社和农业大丰收的《人民公社鲜花开》、《玉米验收》，表现妇女劳动力获得了解放并显示出无比生命力的《惠女锁蛟龙》等作品。战士们的创作中，出现了表现战士保卫祖国和参加社会主义建设的《东海的早晨》、《水库的夜晚》，表现中朝人民战斗友谊的《阵地上的慰问》等作品。群众在创作中为了充分表达新的内容、新的感情，创造了许多新的表现手法和形式。
    尤其可贵的是在今年5月间举行的全国职工文艺会演中，在群众舞蹈创作方面出现了一个突出而鲜明的特点，就是从不同的方面反映了新时代的中国工人阶级的精神面貌，塑造了崭新的工人形象。通过这些形象，生动地表现了我们英雄时代的风貌，热情地歌颂了工人的劳动。《钢铁红旗班》、《英雄矿工》、《巧姑娘》、《伐木工人舞》、《上楞的时候》等节目，都是通过舞蹈艺术表现了钢铁工人、煤矿工人、纺织工人、林业工人的劳动热情。他们的表演是那样豪迈、健壮、有力，具有纯朴、清新的气息，同时又是那样优美，那样富于想像和充满诗意，使人感到劳动的崇高和伟大。在这些节目中，充分表现了无产阶级的美学观。许多优秀的舞蹈节目，给观众以巨大的鼓舞力量，激发了人们为更美好的明天不断斗争的革命意志。
    群众舞蹈活动的普及、繁荣和革新，真正的体现了贯彻普及与提高相结合、专业与业余相结合的正确方针。群众舞蹈活动在质和量上都有了提高和发展，同时，又在提高的基础上迅速地向广大的群众进一步去普及。全国专业舞蹈工作者在开展群众的舞蹈创作和活动方面起了积极的作用，他们在辅导活动的过程中一方面向群众学习，吸收群众创作中不断出现的新因素来丰富自己的艺术实践，同时，也在专业知识和艺术经验上给群众很大帮助。他们为群众培养了艺术人材，辅导他们的创作和演出，帮助他们丰富艺术知识、提高理论修养。这种专业与业余密切结合、相互促进、相互提高的过程，使群众与专业的舞蹈活动都取得了巨大的成就。
    建国以来，专业舞蹈队伍空前壮大，这是解放前所不能相比的。解放前真正专业的舞蹈工作者和舞蹈团是屈指可数的，而今天全国专业歌舞表演团体已在二百个左右，专业舞蹈工作者已有五、六千人。在党的英明的民族政策指导下，各少数民族的专业舞蹈队伍都已成长起来，在全国专业歌舞团体中，就有八十二个是专业民族歌舞团。
    舞蹈事业的大跃进也表现在舞蹈艺术教育事业的发展上。1954年只有一所舞蹈学校，自从大跃进以来，由于社会主义建设事业大发展，目前，几乎每个省都有舞蹈专业，或舞蹈学校。在教学改革运动之后，舞蹈教育事业坚决地贯彻了教育为无产阶级政治服务、与劳动生产相结合的方针，进一步贯彻了党对舞蹈教育事业的领导。在党的培养教育下我们已开始建立了一支年轻的，具有一定政治水平和教学能力的师资队伍，他们担负起为党为人民培养出一批又红又专的全面发展的无产阶级的舞蹈干部的光荣而艰巨的任务。
    从上述的成绩中，我们得到了两点最深刻的体会：
    首先，我们体会到：使我们舞蹈事业获得飞速的发展，舞蹈工作获得胜利的根本原因是：坚决贯彻党的领导，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的文艺方向，坚决贯彻执行舞蹈艺术为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务和百花齐放、百家争鸣、推陈出新的方针。实践证明：这是一条唯一正确的道路。我们舞蹈艺术工作者必须更加紧密地团结在毛泽东文艺思想的旗帜下，坚定地勇敢地前进！
    其次，广大舞蹈工作者坚持政治挂帅，坚持深入生活，参加劳动，与工农兵相结合，改造思想，树立无产阶级的世界观，是推动舞蹈工作大发展，舞蹈创作大繁荣，舞蹈艺术大革新的思想基础和动力。特别要提到的是在舞蹈工作中间贯彻了群众路线。这一方面是在全国范围开展了一个规模很大的群众性的舞蹈创作活动，广大的工农兵群众参加了舞蹈创作和演出活动。另一方面，在专业队伍的艺术实践中，也坚决执行了群众路线，使专业编导与演员集体创作结合起来，个人创造与群众智慧结合起来。在这种新思想新风气的激发下，带来了在创作上破除迷信，勇于革新创造的革命精神，带来了在艺术实践中刻苦钻研，发愤提高的劲头。舞蹈创作、演出、理论、研究等方面都有很大提高，使舞蹈事业取得了巨大的成就。
    舞蹈艺术思想战线上的斗争
    我们的社会主义舞蹈事业从各方面都取得了巨大的成绩，但是在发展的道路上，也不是风平浪静的。因为文学艺术是思想战线上的前哨，总是最敏锐地反映着阶级斗争的形势。社会主义革命愈深入，两条道路的斗争便愈明显地在文学艺术上反映出来。在舞蹈事业上，我们就曾经和各种资产阶级的错误的观点进行过不断的斗争。
    首先，在舞蹈创作上，关于要不要表现革命历史和现实斗争生活，能不能表现这些题材的问题，我们和舞蹈界当中的某些论点，存在着根本的分歧。我们认为这个问题实质上是舞蹈艺术应不应该为工农兵服务和如何为工农兵服务的问题，是必须弄清楚的。
    实践证明了，舞蹈艺术完全可以表现工农兵群众的革命斗争，将来还一定会在这方面发挥它的更大的力量。我们的无产阶级的革命舞蹈艺术不仅勇于表现现代生活中的重大事件，而且还在不断的实践中提高了思想水平和艺术技巧，取得了很大的成就。回顾一下我们的舞蹈创作，我们可以列举出许多作品来说明舞蹈艺术在这方面的成绩。在我们的舞蹈艺术中所表现的革命题材，几乎接触到近百年来革命历史和现代生活的各个方面。如在舞剧《小刀会》中，中国人民在一百年前的反帝反封建武装斗争得到了生动的反映。至于各族人民在中国共产党领导下进行革命武装斗争的题材，在舞剧中出现得更为普遍，如《五朵红云》、《蝶恋花》等等。舞剧《不朽的战士》、《罗盛教》，舞蹈《炸碉堡》则塑造出了抗美援朝正义斗争中国际主义战士的英雄形象。此外，如《将军当兵》、《公社食堂》等等反映大跃进以来新人新事的舞蹈，更是十分普遍。最近，反映平陆事件、马口事件和表现珠穆朗玛峰登山英雄动人事迹的舞剧的出现，更加说明了我们的舞蹈艺术是何等地富于时代气息。
    所有这一切，都说明了革命的舞蹈艺术和其它姊妹艺术一样，在内容上具有鲜明的时代性、革命性，能够积极反映革命历史和现实斗争生活，达到教育人民，鼓舞人民，推动时代前进的目的。
    但是，并不是所有的人都同意这样的观点的。有些人从资产阶级人性论的观点和唯美主义的舞蹈、舞剧的概念出发，说什么：“舞蹈是个人愁苦和快乐的表现”，“舞剧只适宜于表现神话、幻想和爱情的题材”，“爱情是舞剧的永恒主题”。或者抽象地说“舞蹈的特征就是美”，根本否认舞蹈艺术是一定的社会生活的反映，是阶级斗争的武器。从这种资产阶级的艺术观点出发，他们更进一步认为舞蹈“不宜于表现革命斗争的内容和现实的题材”。甚至有人认为用舞蹈去反映现实革命斗争，“满台不是黄军装就是蓝制服，破破烂烂，没有色彩；他们不是战斗就是劳动，既不美，又没有诗意”。还有人说：“穿炼钢服的炼钢工人，在舞台上要多难看有多难看！”说“表现农民形象不美”。他们认为那些为政治服务的表现现实题材的舞蹈都是“临时性”的，“短命”的。而只有那种所谓的纯“美”的“抒情舞蹈”才是“不朽的”。这种论点是非常有害的。它从根本上否定了舞蹈表现工农兵劳动人民和他们的伟大斗争生活的任务，违背了革命舞蹈艺术为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务的正确道路。并且荒谬地用一种资产阶级的憎恶的态度来谈论工农兵，这是令人不能忍受的。
    我们的分歧并不在于抽象地谈论舞蹈艺术要不要表现“美”和“诗意”的问题，能不能表现神话、幻想和爱情题材的问题；而在于如何认识“美”和“诗意”，表现什么人的“美”和“诗意”的问题，用什么观点，表现什么样的神话、幻想和爱情题材的问题。
    持有这种资产阶级艺术思想的人，甚至还会公开宣称：“舞蹈只能表现情感，不能表现理智”。他们所说的“不能”，实质上是“不应该”的意思。这种思想看来是那种认为“舞剧只适宜于表现神话、幻想和爱情”的一种更为荒谬的发展。他们不仅反对表现现实斗争生活，甚至在表现神话、幻想和爱情的时候，也认为不能表现理智，反对世界观对舞蹈创作的决定作用。我们不能设想，在艺术上会有一种没有理智和思想作为依据的情感。事实上，人不能离开社会生活而存在，人的感情就是一定的社会关系和思想观点的表现，所以人的感情不是由人的“本能”所决定，而是由他的社会生活实践所决定，在阶级社会里，就是由社会的阶级关系所决定。无论那是一种什么样的感情，在不同的时代，不同的阶级，都有不同的社会内容，不同的思想基础，都要通过具体的社会生活而表现出来。所以，任何一种感情的产生，无论是自觉不自觉，都是以理智和思想作为基础，具有明确的阶级性。抽象的情感是没有的。像“呼拉圈舞”那一类疯狂的、色情的、丑恶的所谓“舞蹈”，正是那种反动透顶、腐朽不堪的资产阶级没落情感的反映。而中国的《红绸舞》却表现了中国人民热爱新生活的欢腾鼓舞的思想感情。那种否认舞蹈可以表现理智的观点，实际上是在宣扬一种没有阶级性的情感。因为没有理智，也就是说没有思想，也就不可能有什么阶级分析。这样，感情只能有抽象的“个人的愁苦和快乐”的区别，没有阶级的区别；人类可以有一种所谓“共同的人性”，可以有超阶级的“感情”或“爱情”。这种以抽象的“共同人性”、“人类之爱”来解释舞蹈特征和各种社会现象的“人性论”的观点，是反动的修正主义观点的突出的表现。
    在舞蹈表现什么题材的问题上，还有些人不适当地夸大舞蹈的艺术特性，片面强调舞蹈的表现力有局限性，说许多工农兵的现实斗争和革命历史题材是没法表现的。这种“题材局限论”实质也是对舞蹈表现工农兵斗争生活不热心的一种表现。另外还有一种“题材无主次论”的错误的论点，认为“有生活就有舞蹈”，所有生活现象都可以变成舞蹈，实际上是把生活和舞蹈完全等同起来了。
    从以上的各种各样的分歧意见中，不难看出，在舞蹈艺术领域内，关于舞蹈要不要和能不能表现工农兵的斗争生活问题，是无产阶级和资产阶级的两条道路斗争的关键问题。具有这些错误观点的人虽然是极少数，但它的影响却是不能忽视的。
    当然，我们重视革命历史和现实斗争的重大题材，但是也并不是说只要选择了重大题材，就能产生优秀作品。我们认为要产生伟大的作品，题材的选择固然十分重要，但更重要的是要用正确的立场观点，正确的创作方法来处理这些题材；需要我们以强烈的时代精神，正确地表现出丰富的生活，努力刻划出有血有肉的工农兵劳动人民的生动活泼的形象。因为革命历史和现实生活的重大事件永远是和人民群众的命运连系起来的，人民群众的共同命运又是通过典型的人物表现出来的，因此，在舞蹈创作中如果不能更好地表现出一个时代的英雄人物的形象，也就不能更好地表现一个时代的精神面貌。此外，在这方面，我们还要特别重视新生事物的萌芽，它们在今天可能还是少数，可能还很幼稚，但它们却像初升的太阳，是生活里的曙光，有着光明灿烂的远大前途。我们要热情地歌颂我们的时代，歌颂劳动人民的丰功伟绩，歌颂新生事物的成长，并努力掌握革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的方法，使作品的高度的思想性和艺术性得到完美的结合。
    我们的时代是一个富于革命理想和革命乐观主义的时代。人民群众在这个史无前例、一日千里的社会主义建设事业中，精神振奋，斗志昂扬，到处充满着冲天的干劲，到处洋溢着叫高山低头、河水让路的英雄气概。他们抱着社会主义的理想完成了艰巨的民主革命和社会主义革命，今天又在更高的共产主义理想的鼓舞下进行着伟大的社会主义建设。今天的理想，是明天的现实，而明天又会有更高的理想鼓舞着我们前进。这就是我们的时代精神，这就是我们的战斗风格。面对着这个英雄的、充满革命精神的时代，文学艺术也必须寻找一种能与这个时代精神相适应的创作方法，才能产生内容丰富思想深刻的优秀作品。革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法，正是毛主席针对着这样的需要而提出来的最能适应时代要求的创作原则，这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义文艺理论的又一重大贡献。我们的舞蹈艺术，为了要更好地表现我们伟大的时代，更集中、更典型地刻划出工农兵英雄人物的精神品质；为了使我们的舞蹈不仅能反映今天的现实，而且富有革命的理想，不仅能表现出今天，而且也能显示出胜利的明天，那就必须努力学习掌握革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，努力提高我们的创作水平，创作出无愧于我们时代的优秀的舞蹈作品。
    我们强调革命舞蹈要反映革命历史和现实斗争生活，同时强调在政治方向的一致性的前提下，提倡风格、形式、体裁与题材的多样性。几年来，舞蹈艺术创作呈现出空前未有的繁荣局面，正是证明了党的百花齐放、百家争鸣、推陈出新的文艺方针的正确。
    从发展舞蹈艺术表现能力的意义上来说，我们的舞蹈既能生动深刻地表现巨大的主题，革命斗争中的勇士，生产劳动中的英雄；同时，它也擅长表现人们向上的生活中的某一意境，某一幻想。我们要扩大舞蹈艺术的表现能力，而不是缩小其表现能力。恰好，那种认为“舞蹈只能表现爱情、幻想、神话”或“舞蹈只能表现个人的愁苦和快乐”等等，都是把舞蹈艺术的表现能力限制在非常狭小的范围内的观点。
    革命的舞蹈之所以能获得广大群众的喜爱，除了它的内容具有高度思想性之外，还在于它具有鲜明的群众风格、人民所喜闻乐见的民族形式。我们的舞蹈艺术必须进一步民族化、群众化。这就是说，在新时代、新形势下，舞蹈艺术必须在继承和借鉴中外舞蹈艺术遗产的基础上大胆革新，创造出我国无产阶级的富有民族特征的最新最美的舞蹈，以满足人民文化生活日益增长的需要，争取更广大的群众，攀登世界艺术的高峰。民族化、群众化不仅仅是舞蹈形式问题、技术问题，它关系着为谁服务和如何服务的原则问题，是革命的舞蹈工作者的群众观点问题，以及对待中外舞蹈遗产的态度问题。
    我们的舞蹈是表现人民的生活、思想感情的。而人民的生活习惯和表现思想感情的方式是具有民族特性的。人民由于这种特征以及传统文化艺术生活的影响，对艺术也形成了一种特有的欣赏习惯。当然，这种欣赏习惯也不是一成不变的，它正随着社会政治、经济、文化生活的发展逐步变化。我们的舞蹈既然要为人民服务，那就必须经常了解这种状况，根据人民的喜爱和需要，创造艺术上的民族风格，使高度的思想内容能与完美的为群众所喜闻乐见的艺术形式得到高度的结合。
    持有资产阶级艺术观点的人对待这个问题的态度恰好与我们相反。他们习惯于用个人主义的态度来对待舞蹈创作，只是强调个人的艺术趣味，不注意人民的欣赏习惯，不考虑人民爱不爱、懂不懂，只顾打着“艺术个性”的幌子，制造出一些为人民所不理解、不爱看的东西，并且还认为自己的东西是好的，人民不喜爱，不过是时间问题，所谓“艺术性越高，知音者越少，越是看不懂越要演，观众第一次看了反感，第二次怀疑，第三次陶醉，这才是艺术家的艰巨的道路”。应该说，这种观点是完全错误的。按照这种理论，艺术家可以不必去连系群众，向群众学习。他可以把个人的艺术趣味看得高于一切，只能让群众来迁就自己，不能按着群众的喜爱与需要来改造自己的艺术。这种观点是典型的资产阶级的“化大众”的观点，和民族化、群众化的要求是针锋相对的，因而也是十分有害的。
    舞蹈艺术的民族化、群众化问题，根本精神是在于要努力做到毛主席在十八年前所指出的“新鲜活泼的、为中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的中国作风和中国气派”。民族化就是批判地继承旧传统和创造新的民族形式、民族风格、民族传统问题；群众化就是群众观点、群众气派问题，这两者是互相结合互相连系的。为此，要做到民族化、群众化，关键是在于加强舞蹈工作者的群众观点，深入斗争生活，了解人民，向人民学习，改造自己的思想，使自己的感情和人民的感情结合起来，并且还要热情积极地去表现人民的意愿。如果看不起人民，自己的感情和人民格格不入，那就根本谈不到舞蹈艺术的民族化和群众化。
    我们一贯重视民族、民间舞蹈艺术传统，一贯强调民族、民间舞蹈的发掘、收集、整理和加工的工作，并且在工作过程中根据毛主席对传统文化的科学分析和英明指示，不断地和各种错误思想作斗争。通过了思想斗争，在全国范围内掀起了一个发掘、收集、整理、加工各民族、民间和古典歌舞的高潮，取得了很大成绩。
    我们一直和资产阶级对待传统艺术的虚无主义的观点进行不断的斗争。他们错误地把民族、民间舞蹈艺术都看成是封建的落后的东西，采取一笔抹煞的态度。这种态度又是和盲目崇拜西洋的观点相连系的，因为他们既然认为自己民族的传统文化艺术都是糟粕，那就只好全盘搬用西洋的东西。这种观点和已经站起来了的中国人民群众的精神状态是完全不相称的。
    与此同时，我们又和一些保守思想和复古思想进行了斗争，鼓舞了艺术上的革新创造精神。在继承与革新民族、民间舞蹈艺术的过程中，我们同时也鼓励对中国的古代舞蹈进行整理和研究，并且吸收其有用的因素来为今天的人民群众服务。但是，由于古代舞蹈淹没已久，在传说、文字材料中又多数经过封建统治阶级的篡改，粘附着许多封建道德伦理观念，因此，整理研究时特别需要保持敏锐的无产阶级嗅觉，用历史唯物主义的观点仔细分析，不能不分精华糟粕，更不能沉醉于那些充满着封建伦理观念的理论中去而不能自拔。在创造中，我们一方面肯定采用古代音乐、舞蹈素材来编创新舞蹈的做法，这里面也可能产生好的舞蹈作品。同时我们又坚决反对借用古代音乐、舞蹈传播士大夫阶级的遁世思想和封建意识。
    学习、介绍和演出外国舞蹈、舞剧，主要是为了丰富我国人民群众的文化生活，交流经验，学习和吸收其有用的东西，丰富我们自己的舞蹈创作。过去我们曾大量地介绍外国的优秀民间舞蹈和一些舞剧作品，从这里面确实学习到了不少东西；今后仍然要继续介绍和学习。但是，向外国舞蹈、舞剧学习，同样要有所选择，在介绍和学习当中应该有所分析和批判。
    如何借鉴外国舞蹈创作经验，学习运用外国舞蹈的表现形式，加以改造和发展，使之民族化，能够很好地表现中国人民的斗争生活，这更是我们舞蹈工作者当前的重大课题。这方面当然也获得了一些成绩，取得了一些经验，但还要作更大的努力，进行多方面的探索和实验，才能有更大的成就。
    舞蹈工作者的新任务
    革命的舞蹈艺术在党的领导下，在毛泽东文艺思想的光辉照耀下取得的成就是巨大的。我们积累了丰富的经验，确立了光荣的战斗传统，走上了发展和繁荣社会主义、共产主义舞蹈艺术的坚定的道路。
    展望我们光辉的未来，并根据当前社会主义革命和建设事业以及广大人民的需要，提出下列一些任务：
    一、繁荣舞蹈创作，积极创作和演出更多更好的、为广大群众所喜爱的、具有高度思想性与完美的艺术形式相结合的作品，这是我们首要的任务。我们的舞蹈创作，必须努力掌握革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法，坚决贯彻百花齐放，推陈出新的方针，创作多种多样的题材、形式和风格的舞蹈作品，去完成提高人民的共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质的光荣任务。
    要进一步开展理论研究工作，加强创作评论，加强艺术经验的总结，以更好地推动创作、鼓励艺术革新精神。
    二、必须在舞蹈艺术的领域内，在我们全体舞蹈工作者中，深入地展开对现代修正主义和一切资产阶级文艺思想的斗争，坚决地批判资产阶级的和平主义和虚伪的人道主义的思想，揭穿那些企图调和阶级矛盾，否定阶级斗争，从而涣散人民群众的警惕性和斗争意志，模糊对帝国主义和资产阶级反动本性的认识的各种谬论。我们必须在我们的艺术发展方向和具体的艺术实践上坚决地保卫毛主席的文艺路线。
    三、继续大力地深入发掘、整理和革新我国民族民间的传统舞蹈遗产。对这方面的工作，我们不能满足已有的成就，应该更有计划地深入进行，反对那种认为过去的发掘整理工作已经差不多了的思想，而看不见民族民间遗产的丰富和人民不断创造发展的新因素。同时，对于外国优秀的舞蹈艺术，我们也应该认真学习和借鉴。
    四、进一步大力开展群众舞蹈活动，辅导和推动群众的舞蹈创作和演出，把舞蹈活动推向新的高潮。专业舞蹈工作者应该经常直接深入到群众中去辅导群众舞蹈活动，帮助他们提高，培养舞蹈活动中的人才，把推动群众舞蹈运动，作为自己重要的任务。同时应该认真地向群众学习，重视群众创作中在反映新生活、表现新人物方面的重要经验和革新民族民间舞蹈的革命精神，作为自己创作实践的养料。这样，通过群众活动进一步的发展、普及、革新和提高，贯彻普及与提高相结合、专业与业余相结合的方针，把专业与业余两股巨大的力量都充分动员起来，拧成一股绳，把舞蹈艺术创作和活动推向新的高潮。
    五、加强舞蹈协会的工作。舞蹈协会必须在毛泽东文艺思想的红旗下更加紧密地团结全国的舞蹈工作者，帮助他们深入群众斗争生活，参加劳动锻炼，改造思想，努力学习，加强艺术实践。
    为了更好地担负起上述的任务，首先，我们必须勤奋地学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东著作，树立共产主义的世界观。毛主席的文艺思想，以马克思列宁主义的观点精辟地解决了文艺上一系列的原则问题，是马克思列宁主义艺术理论的伟大发展，我们舞蹈工作者必须经常联系实际反复学习，力求能掌握它的精神去指导我们舞蹈艺术的实践和发展。
    舞蹈艺术工作者必须通过上山、下乡、下厂积极参加体力劳动，到斗争生活中去，到群众中去。在实际锻炼中和群众密切结合，改造自己的世界观和思想感情，使自己成为真正劳动化的无产阶级的舞蹈艺术工作者。深入工农兵群众生活，参加劳动锻炼，对于一切舞蹈艺术工作者都是没有例外的，必须反对某些过分强调舞蹈的技术性而轻视参加劳动的错误思想，当然，舞蹈演员的劳动锻炼的方式则应当根据具体情况作恰当的安排，不要一般化。
    有了正确的世界观和思想感情，有了丰富的生活经验，还必须有丰富的艺术修养和艺术技巧，才能更好地创造具有高度思想性和艺术性的作品。我们舞蹈工作者必须为提高我们的艺术修养，认真钻研本部门艺术的各项专业知识，养成刻苦学习不断提高技巧的习惯。我们还应该提高文艺水平，丰富自己历史知识。舞蹈工作者，应该是具有高度的文化水平的艺术工作者。这一方面，对于我们许多年轻的从事舞蹈工作的同志们尤其是重要的事情。
    十一年来的一切事实说明了我们的成就完全是在党的领导下所取得的，党的领导是我们舞蹈事业向前发展繁荣的根本保证，因此我们必须坚决地贯彻党对舞蹈事业的领导，每一个舞蹈工作者都必须成为听党的话的无产阶级的文艺战士。
