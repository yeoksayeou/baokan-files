Remembering Nie Er and Xian Xinghai
Tian Han

I was surprised to receive the Chinese Musicians Association's message commemorating Nie Er and Xian Xinghai. It has been twenty-five years since Nie Er left us, and fifteen years since Xinghai passed away. Time really flies!

I met Nie Er when he arrived in Shanghai from Yunnan via Hunan and Guangdong. At that time, he was a violinist in the orchestra of the Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe (also known as the Five Flowers Song and Dance Troupe in the movies). At the same time, through the introduction of a fellow townsman named Zhang Jun, he participated in the work of the "Shang Fan" (Shanghai Anti-Imperialist League, a mass organization of the Party). He often went to the Huxi area to get close to the working people. Because he had his own ideas about music and art, and was dissatisfied with the musical work he was engaged in, and also because his anti-imperialist patriotic enthusiasm urgently demanded revolution and wanted to be close to the Party, I was invited to meet him at the Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe. We talked a lot, understood his ambition and determination, and also learned about his distress in work and study. Later, I introduced him to the music group of the Soviet Union Friendship Association. Here, he came into contact with several Party musicians, and with their help, improved his ideology and artistic skills. Later, he also joined the Party here. Nie Er transferred from the Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe to the Lianhua Film Company and organized a choir, with himself as the conductor. I still remember when "New Woman" was released, he enthusiastically conducted the choir members, all dressed in workers' clothing, to sing the theme song of "New Woman."

I collaborated with him on many songs, in films from "The Light of Motherhood" ("Mining Song"), "Song of Graduation" from "Plunder of Peach and Plum," to "March of the Volunteers" from "Children of the Storm." In plays, there were "Farewell to Nanyang" and "Mei Niang Song" from "Song of Rejuvenation." We also collaborated on the opera "Storm on the Yangtze River," which will soon be performed by the Central Experimental Opera House to commemorate this musical genius of the Party. (The play is directed by Liu Yumin, with music composed by Mao Yuan.)

"Storm on the Yangtze River" was performed in the spring of 1935 at the YMCA Auditorium on Ba Xianqiao Road in Shanghai, under the guise of celebrating the anniversary of McTyeire High School. The actors at that time included Zheng Junli, Wang Weiyi, and Lulu, all of whom were left-wing dramatists. Nie Er himself played the role of Old Wang, a dockworker in the play. When he rushed towards the enemy, shouting "We are not afraid of death, don't scare us with death," the dockworkers, pile drivers, and bricklayers also sang "We will not be slaves of a conquered nation, we will be masters of China. Let us form an iron Great Wall to drive out all the robbers..." and rushed forward together, arousing enthusiastic resonance among the patriotic masses at the time, and the whole audience roared along. The TASS reporter present also reported this exciting scene to Moscow.

Twenty-five years have passed, and the Chinese working people have become the masters of China. The domestic reactionaries who had to be overthrown at that time have been overthrown, the main aggressor, Japanese imperialism, has also surrendered, and the US imperialism that helped the Kuomintang reactionaries attack the Chinese people has also been driven out of the mainland. The Chinese people have finally achieved liberation, and under the leadership of the Party, are moving from new democracy to socialism. We are holding high the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune to build socialism, and after completing socialist construction, we will forge ahead towards the glorious prospects of communism. This is truly something we should tell Comrade Nie Er with comfort.

Having seen the rehearsals of "Storm on the Yangtze River" by the Central Experimental Opera House, everyone feels that Nie Er's melodies and soaring rhythms are so full of combativeness. At that time, China was suffering from increasingly serious aggression and oppression from Japanese imperialism, forcing every Chinese to answer the question of resistance or surrender. Nie Er answered the enemy and called on his compatriots through his songs full of revolutionary feelings. The "March Song" of "Storm on the Yangtze River" is actually the basis of the later "March of the Volunteers." This tune of "advancing through the enemy's fire" is indeed a bit fiery, and such a tune may not suit the taste of some pacifists. But is Nie Er's tune outdated? I don't think so at all!

Someone once said that the provisional national anthem is outdated. We are now vigorously carrying out the stage of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and will soon transition to a more beautiful communism. How can we still say "The Chinese nation is at its most dangerous time"? Of course, as construction progresses, the provisional national anthem will always be changed, but don't forget that there is still imperialism. Even though they are in their dying stages, they still want to make a final struggle. They are our enemies at every step and attack and sabotage us at all times, not allowing us to build socialism. Therefore, we are not without danger. We must always maintain a high degree of vigilance against the wolfish nature of imperialism, strengthen our unity and efforts, and give the enemies who dare to invade us a heavy blow so that our nation can be free from danger. Therefore, when we are striving to become stronger today, singing more of Nie Er's songs and raising our vigilance and fighting will against the enemy, I think is completely necessary.

I met Comrade Xian Xinghai through Zhang Shu. At that time, they were studying at the Shanghai Music College presided over by Xiao Youmei. Zhang Shu was a member of the Nanguo Society, so Xinghai also became related to the Nanguo Society.

I collaborated more with Xinghai after he returned from France. He really endured a lot of hardship studying music in France, working as a waiter and cleaner in restaurants and bathhouses, or playing the violin on the streets and alleys and in the countryside to make a living. Mr. Ma Sicong also helped him when he was in Paris. Several composers he admired recognized his talent and were moved by his strong will, so they tried their best to teach him theory and skills without charging tuition. His musical knowledge was learned through such hard work.

Xinghai deeply loved his mother. When Xinghai was studying hard in Paris, his mother was also working in Shanghai to make a living in order to support her son's studies. Xinghai only brought his mother back after returning to China. Xinghai's tunes such as "Ding Ying Shang" were presented to his mother.

In 1936, after I was released from prison, I invited Zhang Shu, Xinghai, Jin Shan, and others to meet in Suzhou. We visited Taihu Lake and Dongting Mountain together. In the scenery of mountains and rivers, we exchanged some opinions on drama and music. At that time, Zhang Shu and Xinghai both composed new songs using the lyrics I wrote. I still remember Zhang Shu singing "Yellow River Love" composed by Xinghai on the boat.

We took a photo on Dongting Mountain, which is my only memory with Xinghai.

In Shanghai, Xinghai wrote a national symphony. At first, he also hoped that someone would support the performance of this symphony. Later, he realized that "the meat eaters are mean," so he completely used his strength to promote the anti-Japanese war and promote democratic songs.

In Nanjing, I adapted Tolstoy's "Resurrection" into a play to commemorate the twenty-sixth anniversary of Tolstoy's death, hoping to play a certain role in the revolution through this play. Many songs were used in the play, some composed by Zhang Shu and some composed by Xinghai. "Don't Mention the Affairs of 1759" composed by Xinghai was later changed to "Don't Mention the Affairs of September 18th," which was widely sung during the Anti-Japanese War. The last song, "Vast Siberia," was also composed by Xinghai, with a desolate and melancholic tone but permeated with a majestic and strong mood. I really liked Xinghai's tune. I think he has a kind of spirit that is difficult for others to match. This also explains why he would write the later "Yellow River Cantata."

On August 13th, the all-out War of Resistance against Japan broke out. The Shanghai drama circles organized more than a dozen salvation drama troupes and set off for the interior to carry out anti-Japanese propaganda. Xinghai and Mr. Hong Shen participated in the second Salvation Drama Troupe and traveled to Wuhan via Nanjing and Xuzhou. Here, they joined forces with Zhang Shu, Lin Lu, Zhao Qihai, and others, and organized many amateur choirs to sing anti-Japanese songs. The number of people was as many as 5,000. Their loud and激越songs could be heard in the mountains and waters of Wuhan.

Before the withdrawal from Wuhan, in order to give theatrical workers some political education and consolidate their determination to continue to publicize the anti-Japanese war and strive for democracy, the Third Hall sponsored a training class for theatrical actors staying in Wuhan, and conducted short-term lectures for Beijing-Han Chu opera and acrobatics actors. Xinghai and Zhang Shu participated in this work and composed a class song for them, mainly to encourage the actors to carry forward the national integrity and not sing and dance for the enemy. This song played a great role. At that time, many artists left Wuhan and went to various parts of the southwest regardless of difficulties and hardships, and some paid the price of their lives. To this day, actors of various Han Chu operas in Wuhan can still sing this song.

Xinghai entered Yan'an from Wuhan. Under the direct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, Xinghai's progress was rapid. When I was in Guilin and Kunming, I heard a series of his composed choruses performed in the drama troupe, and later I heard the "Yellow River Cantata," which was such a huge and glorious work! Hearing that the Party sent him to the Soviet Union for further study, we all wished this outstanding musical fighter well, expecting him to create more and better works, but unfortunately, he, like Nie Er, became a non-returning guest.

A series of unfortunate events have occurred in the new music world. Of course, this is not because new music workers have a difficult fate, but an unavoidable phenomenon in the fierce national and class struggles. When I think of the glorious achievements and premature deaths of these Party music fighters, I always feel that the loss is too great. How to make up for these losses? That is to resolutely learn the revolutionary spirit of Nie Er and Xinghai, and launch a socialist national singing movement and opera movement, so that music can play its due role as a revolutionary drummer. Nie Er and Xinghai are great because they stood at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle, courageous and firm, without wavering; because they eagerly pursued the leadership of the Party, and used their hard-earned artistic skills to serve the Party's revolutionary cause. They have been away from us for more than ten or twenty years. "And follow the distant fields of former practitioners," follow in their footsteps and catch up. Our conditions are better than theirs at that time, our team is more than theirs at that time, the scale of our struggle is broader than theirs at that time, and our achievements should also be greater than theirs. I think only in this way can we make up for the loss due to losing them, and inherit and carry forward the revolutionary musical tradition they created.

    回忆聂耳、星海
    田汉
    接到中国音乐家协会纪念聂耳、星海的信使我很惊讶，原来聂耳离开我们竟已二十五年了，星海也逝世十五年了，日子过得真快呀！
    我认识聂耳是在他从云南经湖南、广东辗转到上海的时候，那时他在明月歌舞团（也就是电影里的五花歌舞团）的乐队任小提琴手，同时因他的同乡一位张君的介绍参加了“上反”（上海反帝大同盟，党的群众组织）的工作，他常到沪西一带跟劳动人民接近。由于他对音乐艺术有他自己的想法，又对他所从事的音乐工作有所不满，也由于他反帝国主义爱国的热情迫切地要求革命，要求靠近党，我曾应约到明月歌舞团跟他相见。我们谈得很多，了解了他的雄心壮志，也知道了他在工作学习上的苦闷。后来我介绍他加入了苏联之友社的音乐组，在这里他接触了几位党的音乐家，在他们的帮助下提高了他的思想和艺术技巧，后来他也在这里入了党。聂耳由明月歌舞团转入联华公司，组织了一个合唱团，他自己任指挥。我还记得《新女性》上映时，他热情洋溢地指挥着全部穿工人服装的合唱团员高唱《新女性》主题歌。
    我跟他合作过很多歌曲，电影方面从《母性之光》的《开矿歌》，《桃李劫》的《毕业歌》等，到《风云儿女》的《义勇军进行曲》。话剧方面有《回春之曲》的《告别南洋》、《梅娘曲》等，我们也合作了歌剧《扬子江暴风雨》，这戏最近将由中央实验歌剧院演出，来纪念这位党的音乐天才。（该剧由刘郁民导演，茅沅音乐构成。）
    《扬子江暴风雨》1935年春在上海八仙桥基督教青年会大会堂演出，用的是麦伦中学庆祝校庆的名义。当时演员有郑君里、王唯一、露露等，他们都是左翼戏剧家。聂耳自己扮演剧中的码头工人老王，当他向敌人冲去，吼着“我们不怕死，不要拿死来吓唬我们”，码头工人们，打桩、打砖的工人们也唱着“我们不做亡国奴，我们要做中国的主人。让我们结成一座铁的长城，把强盗们都赶尽……”的战歌跟着一道冲去时，引起了当时爱国群众的热烈共鸣，全场跟着吼起来了。在场的塔斯社记者也把这激动的场景向莫斯科报道了。
    事情隔了二十五年，中国劳动人民做了中国的主人了。当时要打倒的敌人国内反动派已经打倒了，当时主要的侵略者日本帝国主义也投降了，帮助国民党反动派进攻中国人民的美帝国主义也赶出大陆了。中国人民终于获得解放，而且在党的领导下，由新民主主义走向了社会主义，我们正高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗建设着社会主义，在完成社会主义建设后又将向共产主义的光辉远景兼程前进。这真是我们值得向聂耳同志告慰的事。
    看过中央实验歌剧院《扬子江暴风雨》的排练，大家感到聂耳的曲调和高昂的节奏就是那样富于战斗性。当时的中国受着日本帝国主义日益严重的侵凌压迫，逼着每一个中国人回答抗战还是屈服的问题。聂耳通过他那充满着革命感情的歌曲对敌人做了回答，对同胞做了号召。《扬子江暴风雨》的《前进歌》实际是后来《义勇军进行曲》的基础。这种“冒着敌人的炮火前进”的曲调的确是有些火药气的，这样的曲调可能不投合某些和平主义者的口胃了。但聂耳的调子是不是已经过时了呢？我看一点也不！
    曾经有人说代国歌过时了，我们现在是大力进行社会主义革命、社会主义建设阶段，不久将要过渡到更美好的共产主义，怎么还说“中华民族到了最危险的时候”呢？当然，随着建设的进展代国歌总是要换的，但别忘了现在还有帝国主义。尽管它们在垂死阶段，还是要作最后挣扎。它们步步与我们为敌，时时对我们进行攻击破坏，不让我们建成社会主义。因此我们还不是没有危险的，我们必须经常对帝国主义的豺狼本性保持高度警惕，加强自己的团结和努力，给胆敢侵略我们的敌人以狠狠的打击，才能使我们民族免于危险。因此，当我们发愤图强的今天，多唱唱聂耳的歌曲，提高对敌人的警惕和战斗意志，我看是完全必要的。
    我认识冼星海同志是张曙介绍的。那时他们在萧友梅主持的上海音乐专科学校读书。张曙是南国社社员，因此星海跟南国社也发生了关系。
    我跟星海合作较多却是在他从法国回来以后。他在法国学音乐真是辛苦备尝，在菜馆澡堂之类的地方替人家跑堂、扫地，或带着小提琴到街头巷尾村边演奏，以谋一饱。马思聪先生在巴黎的时候也曾帮助过他。他所崇仰的几位作曲大家，看出他的才能，也被他的坚强意志所感动，尽力教给他理论和技巧而不取学费。他的音乐知识就是这样苦学得来的。
    星海十分敬爱他的母亲。当星海在巴黎苦学的时候，他的母亲也在上海给人家做工度日，以成就她儿子的学业。星海回国后才把母亲接回来。星海的曲子像《顶硬上》等就是呈献给他母亲的。
    1936年我出狱以后曾约张曙、星海、金山诸位在苏州会面。我们同游了太湖洞庭山。在山光水色中我们交换了一些戏剧、音乐上的意见。那时张曙和星海都用我写的歌词新谱了一些歌曲，至今还记得张曙在船上唱了星海作曲的《黄河之恋》。
    我们在洞庭山拍过一张照，这是我跟星海的唯一的纪念。
    在上海，星海写了一个民族交响曲，起先他还希望有人支持这个交响曲的演奏。后来才知道“肉食者鄙”，他才把力量完全用在鼓吹抗战、鼓吹民主的歌曲上了。
    我在南京把托尔斯泰的《复活》话剧化，以纪念托尔斯泰逝世二十六周年，是想通过这个戏对革命起一定作用。戏中用了许多歌曲，有张曙作曲的，也有星海作曲的。星海作曲的《莫提起1759年的事》，后来改成了《莫提起九一八的事》，在抗战中传唱甚广。最后一支《茫茫的西伯利亚》也是星海作曲的，苍凉抑郁之中却贯串着一股雄浑坚强的情调。我非常欢喜星海这个曲子。我觉得他有一种别人难及的气魄。这也说明他何以会写出后来的《黄河大合唱》。
    “八·一三”全面抗战爆发，上海戏剧界组织十几队救亡演剧队，向内地出发，进行抗战宣传。星海和洪琛先生们参加了救亡演剧二队，经南京、徐州，转到武汉，在这里和张曙、林路、赵启海等汇合，组织了许多业余合唱队，歌唱抗战歌曲，人数多至五千人，武汉城乡山巅水涯都可以听到他们的高昂激越的歌声。
    当武汉退出以前，为了给戏曲工作者们一些政治教育，巩固他们继续宣传抗战、争取民主的决心，曾由三厅主办了一个留汉戏曲演员训练班，对京汉楚剧和杂技演员进行了短期的讲习。星海与张曙参加了这个工作，并且为他们谱一个班歌，主要是鼓励演员们发扬民族气节，不要为敌人歌舞。这个歌子是起了很大作用的，当时许多艺人都离开了武汉，不顾艰难困苦走向西南各地，有些是付出生命的代价的。至今武汉汉楚各剧演员还有能唱这个歌子的。
    星海是从武汉进入延安的。在党和毛主席的直接领导下，星海的进步一日千里。我在桂林、昆明的时候就听到一系列他所作曲的大合唱在演剧队内演出，后来又听到《黄河大合唱》，那是多么有巨大光彩的作品！听到党送他到苏联深造，我们都为这位卓越的音乐战士祝福，期待他会创作出更多更好的作品，但是很不幸，他也跟聂耳一样成为不归之客。
    新音乐界曾经出现过一连串的不幸事件，当然这不是什么新音乐工作者命途多舛，而是在民族斗争、阶级斗争剧烈进行中难于避免的现象。一想到这些党的音乐战士光辉的业绩和过早的死亡，总觉得损失太大了。怎样弥补这些损失呢？那就是坚决学习聂耳、星海的革命精神，掀起一个社会主义的民族的歌咏运动、歌剧运动，使音乐发挥应有的革命鼓手的作用。聂耳、星海之所以伟大，因为他们站在反帝国主义斗争的最前列，勇往坚定，毫不动摇；因为他们迫切追求党的领导，而用他们勤学苦练得来的艺术技巧为党的革命事业服务。他们离开我们十几年了、二十几年了，“及前修之禾远”，踏着他们的足迹追上去吧。我们的条件比他们那时候好，我们队伍比他们那时候多，我们斗争规模比他们那时候广阔，我们的成就也应该比他们的巨大。我想只有这样才能弥补由于失掉他们的损失，才能继承和发扬他们创造的革命音乐传统。
