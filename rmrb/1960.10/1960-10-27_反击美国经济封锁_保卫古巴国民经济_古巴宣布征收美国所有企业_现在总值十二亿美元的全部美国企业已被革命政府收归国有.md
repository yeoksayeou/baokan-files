Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 25th: The Cuban government announced today the expropriation of 167 U.S. enterprises in Cuba that had not yet been nationalized, in order to counter the economic blockade measures taken by the United States against Cuba and to defend Cuba's national economy. As a result of the Cuban government's decision, all U.S. enterprises in Cuba, with a total value of approximately 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, have been nationalized by Cuba.

The third decision, signed by President Dorticós and Prime Minister Fidel Castro based on the special powers granted to them by the cabinet meeting, was announced early this morning.

The third decision stipulates: through forceful expropriation for nationalization, the state has the right to fully control all assets and enterprises within Cuba belonging to U.S. natural persons or legal entities, or to operators of enterprises in which U.S. interests hold a dominant position, as well as rights and shares arising from the operation of these assets and enterprises.

This decision, in explaining the reasons for nationalizing U.S. enterprises through expropriation, states that the imperialist interest groups manipulating the U.S. government, attempting to use all means to prevent the consolidation of the Cuban revolution, have consistently and continuously carried out increasingly rampant criminal acts of aggression against the Cuban national economy.

The decision states that among the various measures taken by the U.S. government, the U.S. ban on exports to Cuba, attempting to strangle the Cuban economy, is particularly significant in its aggressive nature. The decision points out that this measure violates the basic norms of relations between countries and is a political act of coercion, vainly attempting to create difficulties in national supply and weaken the strength of the Cuban revolutionary people through such coercive pressure.

The Cuban government's third decision states, "Defending the national economy is the responsibility of the revolutionary government. Furthermore, eliminating U.S. industrial and commercial enterprises is also the foundation for liberating and developing our economy. These enterprises are currently the remnants of U.S. financial capital in our homeland."

Among the 167 U.S. enterprises that the Cuban government decided to nationalize this time, there are 17 chemical companies, 8 basic metallurgical companies, 3 paper mills, 6 food production companies, 16 mining and quarrying companies, 30 insurance companies, 15 agricultural machinery companies, 11 hotels, and textile factories, etc. These 167 enterprises are all the remaining U.S. enterprises in Cuba.

Prior to this, the Cuban government had already nationalized some U.S. enterprises that monopolized key sectors of the Cuban economy.

These included the electric power company, 36 sugar mills, all banks, Moa Bay Mining Company, Texaco Oil Company, Esso Mobil Oil Company, and the telephone company, etc.

    反击美国经济封锁　保卫古巴国民经济
    古巴宣布征收美国所有企业
    现在总值十二亿美元的全部美国企业已被革命政府收归国有
    新华社哈瓦那25日电　古巴政府今天宣布征收尚未收归国有的美国在古巴的一百六十七家企业，以反击美国对古巴采取的经济封锁措施，保卫古巴的国民经济。由于古巴政府的上述决定，美国在古巴总值约十二亿美元的全部企业已经为古巴收归国有。
    今天清晨公布了由多尔蒂科斯总统和菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理根据内阁会议授与他们的特别权力而签署的第三号决定。
    第三号决定规定：通过强力征收实行国有化，国家有权完全控制在古巴境内属于美国自然人或法人、或属于那些美国利益占优势地位的企业的经营者的一切资财和企业，以及由于经营这些资财和企业而产生的权利和股份。
    这一决定在阐述通过征收把美国企业收归国有的理由时说，操纵着美国政府的帝国主义利益集团，企图利用一切手段阻止古巴革命的巩固，一贯不断地进行反对古巴国民经济的越来越嚣张的罪恶侵略行动。
    决定说，在美国政府采取的各种措施中，美国禁止对古巴的出口企图借以扼杀古巴的经济，这一行动的侵略性质特别显著。决定指出，这一措施违反了各国相处的基本准则，是一种政治性的强制行为，徒劳无益地企图以这种强制压力造成国家供应的困难，削弱古巴革命人民的力量。
    古巴政府的第三号决定说，“保卫国家经济是革命政府的责任。此外，肃清美国的工商业企业也是解放和发展我国经济的基础，这些企业目前是美国在我们祖国的财政资本的残余。”
    在古巴政府这次决定收归国有的一百六十七家美国企业中，有十七家化学公司，八家基本冶金公司，三家造纸厂，六家食品生产公司，十六家采矿和采石公司，三十家保险公司，十五家农业机械公司，十一家饭店以及纺织厂等。这一百六十七家企业是美国在古巴剩下的全部企业。
    在这以前，古巴政府已经把垄断着古巴经济要害部门的一些美国企业收归国有。
    其中有电力公司，三十六家糖厂，全部银行，莫亚湾矿业公司，德士古石油公司，埃索美孚油公司和电话公司等。
