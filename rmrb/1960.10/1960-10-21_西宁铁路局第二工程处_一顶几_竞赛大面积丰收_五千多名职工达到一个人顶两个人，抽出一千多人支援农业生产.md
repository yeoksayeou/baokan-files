Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 20th – The Second Engineering Office of the Xining Railway Bureau closely integrated the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of technological innovation achievements, and extensively launched a mass competition of “One Top Several, Multiple Combined into One, Greatly Increase Multiples.” Among the 25 engineering teams in the office, 12 teams have reached the level of one team doing the work of two teams, 5 teams have reached the level of one team doing the work of three teams, over 5,000 employees have reached the level of one person doing the work of two, and an average of 9 types of machinery have reached the level of one machine doing the work of 3.66 machines. While comprehensively and balancedly completing the plans for the first three quarters, the entire office also selected over 1,000 employees to support agricultural production. “One Top Several” means one person does the work of several people, one factory does the work of several factories, and one machine does the work of several machines; “Multiple Combined into One” means comprehensively applying various new technologies and new experiences in one workshop, one group, or one process; “Greatly Increase Multiples” means making work efficiency and products increase multiple times.

Since the Party Committee of the Second Engineering Office of the Xining Railway Bureau put forward this movement in the second quarter of this year, Party organizations at all levels in the office have summarized, consolidated, and improved the achievements of technological innovation, enabling employees to further realize the importance and favorable conditions for achieving “One Top Several” in their thinking and actual work. Responsible cadres such as the secretary of the Party Committee of this office also went to various construction sites to help formulate plans for vigorously engaging in technological innovation and launching the “One Top Several” campaign. During construction, they found that the earth and stone transportation capacity could not meet the needs of construction, and the digging and loading capacity could not meet the needs of transportation. They then widely mobilized employees to launch a "One Top Several, Multiple Combined into One, Greatly Increase Multiples" competition targeting the four key aspects of digging, loading, transporting, and unloading. Employees have successively implemented more than 4,000 innovation proposals in this regard, greatly improving the mechanization and semi-mechanization of earth and stone works. Twenty-nine dragon-style automatic lines for earth and stone construction have emerged throughout the office, powerfully promoting the progress of construction. After summarizing the technological innovation experience of the electric traction frame car (originally pushed by people) transportation dragon-style by the employees of the 202 Engineering Section, each engineering section improved and enhanced the transmission, brake handle, and other aspects based on this experience. Twenty-one electric traction frame car dragon-style systems have been implemented and promoted throughout the office, making the efficiency of soil transportation 16 times higher than that of manual transportation.

    西宁铁路局第二工程处“一顶几”竞赛大面积丰收
    五千多名职工达到一个人顶两个人，抽出一千多人支援农业生产
    据新华社西宁20日电　西宁铁路局第二工程处密切结合技术革新成果的巩固、推广、提高工作，广泛开展“一顶几、多合一、大加番”的群众竞赛活动。全处二十五个工程队中已有十二个队达到了一个队顶两个队，有五个队达到了一个队顶三个队，有五千多名职工达到了一个人顶两个人，有九种机械平均达到一台顶三点六六台。全处在全面均衡地完成了前三个季度的计划同时，还抽调出一千多名职工支援了农业生产。“一顶几”就是一人顶几人、一厂顶几厂、一台机器顶几台机器；“多合一”就是把各种新技术、新经验综合应用在一个车间、一个小组或一个工序；“大加番”就是使工作效率、产品成倍的增加。
    自今年第二季度中共西宁铁路局第二工程处党委提出了这一运动后，全处各级党组织都总结、巩固、提高技术革新的成果，使职工从思想上和实际工作中进一步认识实现“一顶几”的重要性和有利条件。这个处的党委书记等负责干部还到各个工地帮助制订大闹技术革新开展“一顶几”活动的计划。他们在施工中发现土石方的运输能力满足不了施工的需要，挖、装能力又满足不了运输的需要，便广泛发动职工针对挖、装、运、卸这四个关键，开展了“一顶几、多合一、大加番”的竞赛。职工们先后在这方面实现了四千多项革新建议，使土石方工程的机械化半机械化程度大大提高。全处出现了土石方施工一条龙自动线二十九条，有力地促进了施工进度。二零二工程段职工在总结了电力牵引架子车（原来是人推的）运输一条龙的技术革新经验后，各工程段又根据这个经验在传动、闸把等方面加以改进和提高，全处实行推广的电力牵引架子车一条龙已达二十一条，使运土工效比人力运输提高了十六倍。
