Yinchuan, October 21st (report from this newspaper) - Based on their experience last year, the Minle Brigade of the Honghua Commune in Yinchuan City, Ningxia, is engaging in a mass movement, using indigenous methods to develop winter vegetable production. Commune members are growing potted vegetables in every household, combining greenhouse and sun-facing plots with indoor pot cultivation, striving to produce more vegetables this winter to supply the city. The Yinchuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is calling on the people of the city to learn and promote the experience of the Minle Brigade of the Honghua Commune in growing potted vegetables in every household. Recently, it issued instructions to Party committees at all levels under the city's jurisdiction, requiring everyone to take action and seize the current favorable opportunity to immediately launch a mass movement to grow potted vegetables, turning every home, every household, every workshop, every office, classroom, and dormitory into a "small greenhouse," to further increase winter vegetable production.

The Minle Brigade is one of the six vegetable production bases in Yinchuan City. The winter vegetable supply mainly relies on storing autumn vegetables in cellars. Although there are some greenhouses, the area is small and cannot meet the needs. In order to produce more fresh vegetables in winter, the brigade's Party branch held a series of meetings last year to mobilize the masses to offer ideas and find solutions. Based on the past habits of the local people of planting garlic sprouts and small onions in winter, in addition to growing greenhouse vegetables, they mobilized commune members to grow potted vegetables on a large scale. More than 80% of the brigade's members planted one to three pots of garlic sprouts, bok choy, and small onions. The entire brigade harvested more than 4,200 catties of potted vegetables, equivalent to the total output of green vegetables from more than 20 greenhouses.

Recently, the Minle Brigade Party Branch conscientiously summarized the experience of growing potted vegetables last winter, and believes that launching a mass campaign to grow potted vegetables in winter is a good method and solves the problem well. Based on last year's experience, the brigade's Party branch also made comprehensive arrangements for potted vegetable production earlier this year. From October 7th to 14th, in eight days, the entire brigade has planted more than ten varieties such as garlic sprouts, celery, chives, rape, spinach, and small onions, totaling 2,400 pots, and is still continuing to transplant.

### 把每个车间、办公室、教室、寝室都变成“小温室”  银川市推广室内栽培盆菜经验

    把每个车间、办公室、教室、寝室都变成“小温室”
    银川市推广室内栽培盆菜经验
    本报银川21日电　宁夏银川市红花公社民乐大队根据去年经验，大搞群众运动，用土办法发展冬季蔬菜生产，社员家家户户大种盆菜，使温室阳畦和室内盆栽相结合，力争今年冬季生产更多的蔬菜供应城市。中共银川市委号召全市人民，学习和推广红花公社民乐大队家家户户种盆菜的经验，最近向市属各级党委发出指示，要求人人动手，趁当前大好时机，立即掀起一个群众性的大种盆菜运动，把每家、每户、每个车间、每个办公室、教室、寝室都变成一座“小温室”，以进一步增加冬季蔬菜生产。
    民乐大队是银川市六个蔬菜生产基地之一，每年冬季的蔬菜供应，主要是依靠窖贮秋菜。虽然也有一部分温室，但是面积不大，满足不了需要。为了在冬季也能生产更多的鲜菜，去年大队党支部曾召开了一系列会议，发动群众出主意，想办法，根据过去这里的群众在冬季栽种蒜苗和小葱的习惯，除种温室蔬菜以外，发动社员大种盆菜，全大队80％以上的社员，都种了一盆到三盆蒜苗、小白菜和小葱，全大队共收获盆菜四千二百多斤，相当于二十多间温室青菜的总产量。
    最近民乐大队党支部认真总结了去冬种盆菜的经验，认为在冬季发动群众大种盆菜，是个好办法，很解决问题。大队党支部还根据去年经验，今年提早对盆菜生产进行了全面安排。从10月7日到14日的八天当中，全大队已栽种蒜苗、芹菜、韭菜、油菜、菠菜、小葱等十多种，共二千四百盆，现在仍在继续移栽。
