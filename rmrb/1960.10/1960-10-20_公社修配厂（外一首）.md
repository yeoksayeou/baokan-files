    Commune Repair Shop (and another poem)
    Zou Difan
    In the center of the crops, there is a repair shop. Ah, in the center of the crops, there is a repair shop. Ah, a new ship enters the green waves, a roc spreads its wings and travels ten thousand miles. The sounds of axes, saws, planes, and chisels harmonize, let us commune members be Lu Ban, windmills raise their arms to capture the wind, carts roll to serve as arms. Molten iron flows in the foundry, casting plowshares, casting plow ears, casting the poem of the earth, new plows enter the soil, ah, swans raise their heads and stir up fine waves... In the iron workshop, you forge sickles, forge horseshoes, I hear the ears of grain ripple in the wind, the ears of grain sing under the sickle; I see horseshoes busy flashing sparks, sparks like star flowers even more fragrant... New ball bearings leave the factory, yesterday they went to the commune to report the good news, rejoicing in having both native and foreign methods, rejoicing in self-reliance growing stronger day by day... Oh, the lathe is turning, oh, the electric welding is flashing, turning out a new world! Welding a golden bridge to paradise!

    Moonlight Over the Village
    The autumn night is good under the moonlight, shining on the village, like a movie, the film projection team is playing a movie at the village entrance. Moonlight shines on the village, the stream flows around the village, cadres sent to lower levels bid farewell to the commune tomorrow, writing poems on the white wall under the moonlight. Moonlight shines on the village, several chestnut horses, freely drinking water from the stream, flocks of sheep return from outside the village. Moonlight shines on the village, electric lights shine beside the cowshed, a calf is about to be born, the breeder is busy with happy events. Moonlight shines on the village, osmanthus fragrance fills the sky, the working people control culture, the sound of reading is loud in the village...

    公社修配厂（外一首）
    邹荻帆
    在庄稼的中央，有一座修配厂。啊，在庄稼的中央，有一座修配厂。啊，一只新船入绿波，大鹏展翅万里航。斧锯刨凿齐交响，鲁班且让我们社员当，风车举手擒风力，大车滚动当臂膀。翻砂间里熔铁浆，铸犁铧，铸犁耳，铸大地的诗行，新犁入土啊，天鹅昂首腾细
  浪。……在铁工间里，你们打镰刀，打马蹄铁，我听见禾穗在风中波响，禾穗在镰刀下歌唱；我看见马蹄奔忙闪星火，星火像星花花更香……滚珠轴承新出厂，昨天到公社去报喜，喜的是有土有洋，喜的是自力更生日日强……噢，旋床在转动，噢，电焊在闪光，旋出一个新世界！焊接金桥向天堂！
  月光照村庄秋夜好月光，照着村庄，像电影一样，电影队正在村头把电影放。月光照村庄，绕村流泉响，下放干部明天别公社，月下题诗白粉墙。月光照村庄，几匹栗色马，自在地饮水泉流上，村外回来一群群羊。月光照村庄，电灯照在牛栏旁，小牛犊就要出世，饲养员办喜事忙。月光照村庄，桂花飘天香，劳动人民掌文化，村庄读书声琅琅……
