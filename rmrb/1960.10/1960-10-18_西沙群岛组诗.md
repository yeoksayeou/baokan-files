    Xisha Islands Suite
    Ke Yuan
  The ship sails, the ship sails, heading towards the bright Big Dipper; the ship sails, the lights melt into the Milky Way's stream of light. Clouds and mist on the sea, please don't linger on the route, let us see off the departing ship, carrying the people of Xisha's greetings to the motherland. Please hand over the fertile guano to the farms to welcome a bumper harvest; sea breeze, blow over the fragrance of rice, it is so intoxicating, better than vintage wine. Please send the colorful sea willow to international friends who have come from afar, though we are separated by mountains and seas, we cannot meet, but we are still heart to heart, hand in hand. Please plant the bright red coral tree at the gate of the Great Hall of the People, it is like our hearts, blooming in all seasons, never withering. Please send the precious sea cucumber to Zhongnanhai, to our beloved leader, if Chairman Mao tastes it, we will be so happy that we will talk about it all night long. The ship sails, heading towards the bright Big Dipper; the ship sails, the lights melt into the Milky Way's stream of light. Motherland! Please turn all the stars of the Milky Way into the lights of thousands of ships! Watch us move the Crystal Palace from the South China Sea and build a new mansion on Chang'an Street!
    Xisha Homeland
  Through wind and rain, overcoming raging waves, the fishing fleet came to the desolate Xisha, and erected triangular tents. The young men are full of bulging muscles, the old fishermen are weathered, after fishing, they like to sit together and talk about their relatives and hometowns. Only the captain always sits beside them, silently puffing on his pipe. Then he softly says: "Fishermen cross rivers and seas, wherever they cast their nets, that is their hometown." No one paid attention to his words, and the captain still listened to everyone's talk with a smile. One day, the fleet came from the mainland, and the captain's wife stood at the bow of the ship, holding a baby. Ah! This child was just born, and the captain moved the whole family to the island, a simple backpack, a yellow bamboo basket, filled with the songs and flowers of his hometown. At night, everyone crowded into the captain's house, as lively as celebrating the New Year, the child was passed around in people's hands, and everyone smiled and sang to him happily. This is the first child to come to Xisha! White and chubby, growing so healthy. Hair as black as乌云, eyes like two stars falling into the ocean. This is the first child to come to Xisha! Look at his smile like spring flowers blooming, as if he is about to embrace the whole life, not taking the wind and waves of the South China Sea to heart at all. Someone gave him golden sea pine, red coral, and someone picked up a handful of shells, shining brightly. Among these many treasures, a new generation will grow up in Xisha. No one talked about missing their hometown anymore, but together they praised the treasures of Xisha to the captain's wife. The captain remained silent with a smile, and after smoking his pipe, he took everyone to repair the boat and mend the net by the moonlight. And the next time the fleet approached Xisha, a familiar face flashed under the white sails, ah! Here they come, the fishermen's relatives, like coconut trees, taking root and growing here... Look today, red brick houses are built on the island, chickens crow and pigs squeal, everywhere is joy and commotion, children are playing under the maple trees, women are drying colorful clothes in the yard. Everyone is singing under the eaves, and a lively village has grown up on Xisha Island. Our captain, you stand in front of the map, with a smile, what new plan are you thinking about?
      Postmark
  Seagulls fly up and down the eaves, several tall coral flowers at the door, da, da, da, da, who is gently knocking under the window? It is the young postal worker holding a postmark, stamping flowers on the envelope, the fragrance of ink rises in the flowers, and two dazzling words flash in the fragrance "Xisha". For many years, Xisha has never had a post office, the sea is wide and the clouds are deep, how can letters be sent, from the mainland, a passionate wild goose flew, he is not afraid of hardship, and settled down here. From then on, how many lines pass through the sky and the ocean, so that people in the distance no longer have to yearn for it; from then on, one by one nameless islands in Xisha, wear flowers and travel all over the world. How many things are printed on the small postmark, look! Beautiful seagulls, white coral flowers, the ambition of the people of Xisha like the ocean, the shining youth of the postal worker...
    Weather Sentinels
  There is a group of young girls at the weather station, they go to the beach to laugh and sing during their breaks, they also like to chase the tide barefoot, and pick up colorful shells to decorate their clothes. Whenever the long-distance fleet returns, they always go to help carry fish and dry nets, and people embroider words of praise into a red flag and hang it where they work. Every day, they always lift the fog and come to the beach, release sounding balloons to welcome the sun; late at night, they still stand in the wind outside the house, gazing at the moving clouds and twinkling stars. When a strong wind hits and sand and dust fill the sky, their white clothes still flutter on the beach; when heavy rain knocks on the windows of the small house, they still calmly tap the telegraph key. No matter how eccentric the South China Sea's temper is, the girls can figure out when it will stir up wind and waves. The fleet comes and goes in their exhortations, and each time it fills the cabin with harvest. The old director said they are a group of pigeons, spreading cheerful songs all over the island; the fishing captain said they are a group of seagulls, their hearts always fly with the fleet. The girls call themselves weather sentinels, proudly standing guard for the motherland in Xisha, painting the wind and clouds of the South China Sea in their hearts, and adorning the glory of the South China Sea on their clothes.
  Yongxing Island by Night
  When the night of the South China Sea falls, the color of the sea becomes darker and darker. Yongxing Island! Like a golden lotus flower floating from the water, the bright lights reflect each other, taking away the brilliance of the stars in the sky. In the light, who are those people, running back and forth on the beach; in the night mist, where is there singing lingering, letting the waves listen in fascination. Ah, this is the fishing boat returning from a long voyage ashore, the shoulder poles on the gangway are shaking slightly; workers loading guano into the ship while taking advantage of the night, the carts squeaking and forming a team. As soon as the cart is dumped, the silvery guano piles up into a mountain, as soon as the shoulder pole is put down, the golden fish and shrimps pile up into a pile, joyful songs rise from here, and closely accompany the footsteps of labor. The sleeping seabirds are awakened, carrying the lights and flying gently; the cool sea breeze is full of affection, carrying the songs and blowing slowly. Ah! The night is getting deeper, the night is getting deeper, the lights are brighter, the people's songs are higher, and the scenery of Yongxing Island is more beautiful.

    西沙群岛组诗
    柯原
  轮船驶去了轮船驶去了，朝着明亮的北斗；轮船驶去了，华灯溶入银河的光流。海上的云呵，雾呵，请不要在航线上逗留，让我们目送远行的轮船，带去西沙人对祖国的问候。请把那肥沃的鸟粪，交给农场去迎接丰收；海风呵，吹来那稻谷的清香吧，它是那么令人心醉，胜似陈年
  美酒。请把那色彩斑烂的海柳，送给远道而来的国际朋友，隔山隔海，我们见不到面，却依然心贴着心，手挽着手。请把那鲜红的珊瑚树，种植在人民大会堂门口，它就像我们的心呵，四季开花，永没有雕谢的时候。请把那名贵的梅花参，送到中南海，送给敬爱的领袖，假如毛主席尝一口呵，我们便会欢乐得彻夜谈论不
  休。轮船驶去了，朝着明亮的北斗；轮船驶去了，华灯溶入银河的光流。祖国呵！请把银河的繁星，都变作千万轮船的灯光吧！看我们从南海搬出水晶宫，在长安街头盖起一座新的大
  厦！
    西沙家园穿过狂风暴雨，战胜惊涛怒浪，捕鱼队来到荒凉的西沙，搭起一座座三角形的篷帐。小伙子浑身是凸起的肌肉，老渔民满面风霜，捕鱼归来，都爱坐在一起，谈论自己的亲人和家乡。只有队长总是坐在旁边，默默地把烟袋抽得吱吱响。然后轻轻地说：“捕鱼人穿江
  过海，哪里撒网，哪里就是家乡”。大家谁也没有注意他的话，队长也还是含笑听大家谈讲。有一天，船队从大陆来了，队长的妻子抱着婴孩站在船头
  上。呵！这个孩子刚出生不久，队长就把全家搬来岛上，简单的背包，黄竹的篮子，盛满了家乡的歌声和花香。夜晚，大家挤在队长家里，热闹得好像过年一样，小孩子在人们手中抱来抱去，大家高兴地对他又笑又唱。这是到西沙的第一个孩子呀！白白胖胖，长得多么健康。乌云一样黑黑的头发，眼睛像两颗星星落进海洋。这是到西沙的第一个孩子呀！看他笑得像春花怒放，仿佛马上要拥抱整个生活，全不把南海的风浪放在心上。有人送他金海松，红珊瑚，有人拣来一把贝壳，闪闪发光。在这许多珍宝中间，新的一代就要在西沙成长。没有人再谈论对家乡的怀念，却一起向队长妻子夸耀西沙的
  宝藏。队长依然含笑不语，抽罢烟，又趁着月光，领大家去修船补
  网。而当下一次船队靠近西沙，白帆下闪出一张张亲人的面
  庞，呵！来了，渔民的亲人们，像椰树一样来这里扎根生长……看今天，岛上盖起红色的砖房，鸡鸣猪叫，处处是欢腾喧嚷，孩子们在麻枫桐树下玩耍，妇女们在院里晾满了花衣裳。每个屋檐下都有人在歌唱，西沙岛上成长起热闹的村庄。我们的队长呵，你站在地图前，含着微笑，又把什么新的计划
  思量？
      邮　戳海鸥在屋檐飞上飞下，门口几株高大的珊瑚花，达，达，达，达，是谁在窗下轻轻敲打？是年青的邮务员手拿邮戳，在信封上打出朵朵鲜花，花丛里飘起油墨的香气，香气中又闪出耀眼的两个字
    “西沙”。多少年，西沙从来没有邮局，海阔云深，一封封书信怎寄达，从大陆呀，飞来了多情的鸿雁，他不怕艰苦，在这里安下了家。从此呀，多少根线穿过天空海
  洋，让远方的人们再不必渴望牵
  挂；从此呀，一个个西沙无名小岛，佩着鲜花走遍天下。小小的邮戳上印着多少东西，看吧！美丽的海鸥，洁白的珊
  瑚花，西沙人海洋般的壮志雄心，邮务员闪光的青春年华……
    气象哨兵气象站有一群年青姑娘，一休息就到海边又笑又唱，还喜欢光着脚追逐潮水，拣来彩色的贝壳缀在衣襟上。当每次远航船队归来，她们总要去帮忙抬鱼又晒网，人们把赞美的话绣成一面红
  旗，挂在她们工作的地方。天天总是掀开雾帐来到海边，放出探空气球去迎接太阳；夜深了还在屋外迎风伫立，凝望游动的云，闪烁的星光。当狂风袭来沙尘漫空，海滩上还飘动着她们白色的衣
  裳；暴雨狂敲小屋的玻璃窗，她们依然安详地把电键滴答敲
  响。那怕南海的脾气再古怪，姑娘们算得出它哪时兴风作
  浪。船队在她们的叮咛声中来来往
  往，次次都把丰收装满船舱。老主任说她们是一群鸽子，把快活的歌声洒遍岛上；捕鱼队长说她们是一群海鸥，颗颗心总跟着船队飞翔。姑娘们却把自己叫做气象哨
  兵，在西沙骄傲地为祖国站岗，把南海的风云，绘在自己的心
  间，把南海的光彩，缀在自己的衣
  襟上。
  永兴岛夜泊当南海夜幕低垂，海水的颜色越来越黑。永兴岛呵！像金色的莲花从水
  中浮起，明灯相映，夺去了满天星斗的
  光辉。灯影里，哪是些什么人，在沙滩上奔忙来回；夜雾里，何处有歌声缭绕，让波涛听得如痴如醉。呵，这是远航归来的渔船靠岸
  了，跳板上扁担挑得颤微微；趁夜深装船的鸟肥工人，小车子吱吱吜吜排成队。小车一倒，银色的鸟肥垒成
  山，扁担一放，金色的鱼虾堆成
  堆，欢乐的歌声就从这里飘起呀，又紧紧地把劳动的脚步伴随。沉睡的海鸟惊醒了，载着灯光轻轻地飞；凉爽的海风满含情意，载着歌声慢慢地吹。呵！夜更深了，夜更深了，灯光更亮，人们的歌声更高，永兴岛的风光更美。
