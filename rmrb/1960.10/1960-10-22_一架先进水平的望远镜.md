    An Advanced Telescope
    In the Shanghai Municipal Youth Science and Technology Activity Exhibition Hall, there stands a white telescope about four or five feet tall. This is an astronomical telescope capable of clearly photographing solar and lunar eclipses, taking pictures of the moon that reveal its craters, and capturing sunspots on the sun. Its creator, Zhang Jiaxuan, developed a great interest in the starry sky at the age of twelve. From then on, he and his friends began making various astronomical telescopes. In the process, he adhered to the belief of "never giving up until it's done well," searching everywhere for materials and learning techniques. When grinding the lens, he persisted in grinding it well even when his hands became red and swollen. When photographing sunspots, because he lacked a dark filter and a perfect shutter, the film was repeatedly burned by the sunlight. He never succumbed to these difficulties, big or small. At the age of fifteen, he created this astronomical telescope with a precision reaching the advanced domestic level. During the 1958 holidays, he was invited to participate in the production of China's first Maksutov telescope (one of the world's newest types of telescope). (Science)

    一架先进水平的望远镜
    在上海市少年科技活动展览馆里，有一架四、五尺高的白色的望远镜摆在那里。这是一架天文望远镜，能清晰地拍出日蚀、月蚀，替月球拍的照片能看出上面的环形山，还能拍下太阳上的黑子。它的制作者张家瓛，从十二岁时就开始对星空发生很大的兴趣，从那时起，他就和朋友们制作各种各样的天文望远镜。在制作中，他抱着“不做好决不罢休”的信念，到处找材料、学技术。磨镜头时，手磨得红肿了仍坚持把镜头磨好。拍摄太阳的黑子，因为没有黑镜片和完善的快门，胶卷一次又一次地被阳光烧坏，大大小小的困难都没有使他低过头。在他十五岁的时候，就制成了这架精确度达到国内先进水平的天文望远镜。1958年假期中，他应邀参加了中国第一架马克苏托夫式望远镜（世界最新望远镜的一种）的制作工作。　（科）
