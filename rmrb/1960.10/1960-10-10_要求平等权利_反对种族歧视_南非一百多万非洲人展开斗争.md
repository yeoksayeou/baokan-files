Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, October 5th: Large-scale struggles have recently erupted among people from all walks of life in South Africa, resisting the racial discrimination policies and brutal rule of the South African Union authorities.

According to South Africa's "Contact" newspaper, in the Dimbaza African "reserve" of Transkei in the eastern Cape Province of South Africa, 1.3 million Xhosa-speaking Africans have angrily launched a struggle, demanding equal rights in their own country and resolutely opposing the so-called "Bantu Autonomous Government" imposed on them by the South African Union Verwoerd government to implement racial segregation. The newspaper said that local Africans have burned down the hut of an assistant to a puppet chief because it contained so-called "investigation reports" prepared to persecute the people.

Other sources say that on the evening of October 2, in the African township of Cato Manor in the suburbs of Durban, a major South African port, a group of Africans launched a struggle against colonial police in order to rescue a compatriot who had been unreasonably arrested. The police opened fire on the Africans, and the heroic Africans fought back with stones.

Prior to this, according to Johannesburg's "Homeland" newspaper, the South African "Women's Anti-Pass Struggle Committee" distributed leaflets in Durban on September 29, calling on the people to hold demonstrations and mass rallies to protest the South African authorities' reactionary decision to require all South African African women aged sixteen and over to carry "passes" from the beginning of next year.

    要求平等权利　反对种族歧视
    南非一百多万非洲人展开斗争
    据新华社5日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非各地各界人民最近又纷纷掀起大规模斗争，反抗南非联邦当局的种族歧视政策和它的残暴统治。
    据南非“联系报”报道，在南非开普州东部特兰斯基的非洲人“保留地”登布兰德，一百三十万讲豪萨语的非洲部族人已经愤怒地展开斗争，要求在自己的国家里享有平等的权利，并且坚决反对南非联邦维沃尔德政府为实行种族隔离而强加在他们头上的所谓“班图自治政府”。这家报纸说，当地非洲人已经焚毁了一个傀儡酋长助手的小屋，因为那里存放着准备迫害人民的所谓“调查报告”。
    另有消息说，10月2日晚上，在南非大港德班郊区的非洲人市镇卡托马诺尔，一批非洲人为了营救一名被无理逮捕的同胞，同殖民警察展开了斗争。警察向非洲人开枪，英勇的非洲人用石块进行了反击。
    在这以前，据约翰内斯堡“祖国报”报道，南非“妇女反对通行证斗争委员会”9月29日曾在德班散发传单，号召人民举行示威游行和群众集会，抗议南非当局宣布年满十六岁的南非非洲妇女从明年初起必须携带“通行证”的反动决定。
