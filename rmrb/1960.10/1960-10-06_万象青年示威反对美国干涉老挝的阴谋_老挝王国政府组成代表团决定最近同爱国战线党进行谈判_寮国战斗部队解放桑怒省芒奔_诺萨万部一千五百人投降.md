Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 5th - Vientiane dispatch: Four thousand Vientiane youths gathered on the 4th to oppose the entry of the so-called "United Nations Forces" and Southeast Asia Treaty Organization forces, controlled by US imperialism, into Laos. They demanded that the Phouma government not compromise with the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, hold negotiations with the Lao Patriotic Front, implement a strict neutral policy, and establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Prince Phouma and Captain Kong Le both attended the rally.

It is reported that the demonstrating youths distributed leaflets demanding that the Lao issue be resolved through negotiations with the Lao Patriotic Front on the basis of the five conditions proposed by the Lao Patriotic Front.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th - The Voice of the Lao Fighting Forces radio station today published a commentary suggesting that the Royal Lao Government side should hold talks with the Lao Patriotic Front as soon as possible.

The commentary pointed out, "Currently, what is particularly noteworthy is that US imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique are colluding with some high-ranking military officers of the Royal Government in an attempt to force the King and the government to concede and restore the power of the Phoumi clique in the government and the army."

The commentary said, "All Lao people who care about the fate of their motherland believe that the government and the Lao Fighting Forces must hold talks immediately. These talks will strengthen national unity, smash the sinister schemes of US imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nac Champassak traitorous clique, and further consolidate the position of the Phouma government. Therefore, these talks will create favorable conditions for the realization of a peaceful and neutral policy and bring unity and national harmony to the country."

The commentary concluded: Following the great victories achieved by the Royal Government and the Lao people in North Xon and Xieng Khouang Province, if the talks between the Royal Government and the Lao Patriotic Front can be conducted in a timely and smooth manner, it will be a new and important victory, which will bring new and favorable conditions to the Lao people's struggle for genuine peace, neutrality, and national harmony.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 5th - According to a broadcast by Vientiane Radio today: The Royal Lao Government has formed a delegation to negotiate with the Lao Patriotic Front. The head of the delegation is Quinim Pholsena, Minister of Information and Strengthening Civil Servants' Positions, and the members are: Touby Lyfoung, Minister of Justice; Sisoumanh Vongkhamphou, Deputy Minister of Rural Consolidation; and Van Radikone, Deputy Minister of National Defense.

The broadcast said that the two delegations will hold negotiations in Vientiane soon.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 5th - Vietnam News Agency dispatch on the 5th: According to Vientiane Radio, the Royal Lao Government has studied the proposal made by Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk at the current United Nations General Assembly to establish a neutral zone in Indochina consisting of Cambodia and Laos, and has telegraphed its opinions to the Lao representative to the United Nations.

Vientiane Radio said that the Lao government has also decided to accept fifty tons of rice donated to Laos by Cambodia. The Royal Lao Government will be responsible for the transportation of this batch of rice.

According to the agreement between the Lao government and the Burmese government, the Lao government has also decided to send a plane to Burma to transport oil back to Vientiane.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 5th - According to the Vietnam News Agency, citing a Vientiane dispatch, Muong Phanh, about 30 kilometers southwest of the provincial capital of Xieng Khouang Province, has been liberated from the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nac Champassak rebel group by the Lao Fighting Forces and the Lao People's Armed Forces.

The report said that after the Phoumi Nosavan troops in the provincial capital of Xieng Khouang were defeated on September 28, they were pursued to Muong Phanh by the Lao Fighting Forces and the People's Armed Forces. There, these troops refused to obey the orders of the reactionary commanders to resist stubbornly or retreat again, and 1,500 people surrendered.

The report said that the captured soldiers were very happy to be free from the control of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nac Champassak rebel group.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th - According to a broadcast by the Voice of the Lao Fighting Forces radio station today: After Xieng Khouang Province was liberated from the rule of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nac Champassak group, more than 2,000 people from various villages in Xieng Khouang County held a rally to welcome the victory of the liberation of Xieng Khouang Province, and accused US imperialism of plotting to turn Xieng Khouang into its military base and the heinous crimes of the reactionary elements in Xieng Khouang.

According to incomplete materials revealed by local people at the meeting, from January to June of this year, the reactionary elements in Xieng Khouang County arrested and killed 67 civilians, burned down 128 houses, forced 400 residents to concentrate in Xieng Khouang City, and also burned down 13 granaries and robbed 114 cattle. In January of this year, the reactionary elements arrested a cadre of the Lao Fighting Forces, cruelly packed him in a sack and threw him from an airplane to the ground; on February 6, they killed three guerrillas in Muong Ngan County.

After Captain Kong Le launched the coup and the Phouma legitimate government was established, the henchmen of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique stubbornly "swept" and persecuted the people and continuously attacked the Lao Fighting Forces. Even after the armed forces of the Lao Fighting Forces ceased hostilities on September 20, they still carried out "sweeps" in many villages, causing serious losses to the people. The people of Xieng Khouang County were very angry about this and expressed their determination to resolutely fight against the Nosavan-Boun Oum rebel group.

    评论指出，“目前，特别值得注意的情况是，美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万叛国集团正在同王国政府的一些高级军官进行勾结，企图迫使国王和政府让步，恢复富米集团在政府和军队中的权力”。
    评论说，“所有关心到祖国命运的老挝人民都认为，政府和寮国战斗部队必须立即进行会谈。这次的会谈将加强民族的团结，粉碎美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛国集团的毒辣阴谋，更进一步巩固富马政府的地位。因此，这次的会谈将为实现和平中立政策创造顺利条件，为国家带来统一和民族和睦。”

    根据老挝政府和缅甸政府之间的协议，老挝政府还决定派遣一架飞机前往缅甸将石油运回万象。
    新华社河内5日电　据越南通讯社援引万象消息说，桑怒省会西南约三十公里的芒奔，已经被寮国战斗部队和老挝人民武装力量从富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛乱集团手中解放出来。
    消息说，桑怒省省会桑怒的富米·诺萨万军队在9月28日被击溃后，被寮国战斗部队和人民武装力量追赶到芒奔。这些军队在那里拒绝服从反动指挥官们发出的关于进行顽抗或者再度溃退的命令，有一千五百人投降。

    据当地人民在会上揭发的不完全材料，从今年1月到6月，桑怒县的反动分子逮捕和杀死了六十七个平民，烧毁一百二十八间房屋，强迫四百名居民集中到桑怒市，还烧毁了十三个谷仓，抢走一百一十四头牛。在今年1月间，反动分子曾逮捕了寮国战斗部队的一名干部，残酷地装在麻袋里从飞机上扔到地面；今年2月6日，他们又杀死了芒农县三名游击队员。
    在贡勒大尉发动政变和富马合法政府成立之后，富米·诺萨万叛国集团的爪牙还在当地顽固地“扫荡”、迫害人民和连续进攻寮国战斗部队。即使在9月20日寮国战斗部队的武装力量停止敌对行动之后，他们也仍然在许多乡村进行“扫荡”，使人民遭受严重损失。桑怒县人民对此非常愤恨，并表示要坚决为反对诺萨万—文翁叛乱集团而斗争。
