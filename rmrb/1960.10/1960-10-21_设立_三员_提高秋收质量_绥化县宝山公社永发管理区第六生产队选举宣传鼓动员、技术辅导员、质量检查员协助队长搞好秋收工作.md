    Establishing "Three Members" to Improve Autumn Harvest Quality
    Yongfa Management Area, Baoshan Commune, Suihua County, Sixth Production Team Elects Propaganda Mobilization Member, Technical Guidance Member, and Quality Inspection Member to Assist the Captain in Doing a Good Job of Autumn Harvest
    (Reported by our newspaper) The Sixth Production Team of Yongfa Management Area, Baoshan People's Commune, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, has established propaganda mobilization members, technical guidance members, and quality inspection members in the autumn harvest, strengthening the leadership of the autumn harvest and improving the quality of the autumn harvest.
    After the autumn harvest production began, in order to ensure a fast and meticulous autumn harvest this year, the cadres of the Sixth Production Team mobilized the commune members to elect commune members Wu Chang, Wu Fengqin, Guan Fu, Liu Yun, and Li Fa to work as propaganda mobilization member, technical guidance member, and quality inspection member respectively. The propaganda mobilization member is responsible for carrying out ideological education work related to doing a good job in the autumn harvest; the technical guidance member provides technical guidance on autumn harvest production to commune members; the quality inspection member inspects the quality of the autumn harvest, directly helps solve poor quality phenomena, or submits them to the production team for resolution. The commune members selected as the above "three members" are all progressive in political thought, have high technical skills, and are conscientious and responsible in their work. Under the leadership of the production team leader, they help the production team leaders to carry out their respective work separately.
    After the establishment of the "three members" in Yongfa Management Area, each member conscientiously carried out their work, bringing a new atmosphere to the autumn harvest. Propaganda mobilization members Wu Chang and Wu Fengqin read the newspaper to the commune members during labor breaks every day, explained the Party's guidelines and policies on vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and sometimes organized commune members to hold on-the-spot discussions. This greatly improved the commune members' ideological understanding and increased their enthusiasm and initiative in doing a good job in the autumn harvest. For example, propaganda mobilization member Wu Chang once read to the commune members the provincial party committee and provincial people's committee's instructions on carrying out autumn harvest work published in the newspaper. Zhou Deye, who was seventy-two years old, immediately proposed to the captain his opinions on guaranteeing a good autumn harvest, one of which was to suggest using auxiliary labor or semi-labor to replace the strong and technically skilled laborers in non-field operations to participate in field harvesting work. The captain adopted his suggestion, and his son became a harvesting expert under this circumstance, from being a feeder. Guan Fu and Liu Yun, the technical guidance members of this team, are two commune members recognized by the masses as having higher technical skills. Since taking on the job of technical guidance member, they have been participating in the autumn harvest and helping commune members improve their production technology. On October 4th, twenty students from Harbin Jiaotong University went to the field to harvest sorghum. Many people did not extend their knives correctly, leaving stubble of varying heights, and they did not know how to tie their waists after cutting the crops. Guan Fu immediately taught them three methods of harvesting sorghum, and then he also gave a demonstration for the students. With the help of Guan Fu, thirteen young commune members in the team with insufficient technical skills improved their skills, and most of the students also learned some technical work in the harvest, which effectively guaranteed the quality of the autumn harvest. Quality inspectors Li Fa and Wu Fengqin are even more conscientious and responsible in their work. Commune member Gan Cai left high stubble when cutting millet, and two or three ears could be pulled from one meter away. After quality inspector Li Fa checked out this problem during the break, he immediately told him to pick up the millet ears pulled on the ground. According to statistics on October 5, this team had harvested more than 1,600 mu of autumn crops, accounting for more than 65% of the total area of autumn crops, and had pulled out 750 mu, accounting for 31% of the area to be pulled. The quality of these harvested and pulled lands is very good. Now the commune members are full of energy and continue to carry out the battle for the autumn harvest.
    The work of the "three members" of the Sixth Production Team is carried out directly under the leadership of the team committee and the team leader. The team committee absorbs them to participate in each meeting. In addition to strengthening ideological education for them, it also conveys the instructions of the superior party, explains the current production tasks and requirements of the team, and helps them establish regular work systems and work methods.

    设立“三员”提高秋收质量
    绥化县宝山公社永发管理区第六生产队选举宣传鼓动员、技术辅导员、质量检查员协助队长搞好秋收工作
    本报讯　黑龙江绥化县宝山人民公社永发管理区第六生产队，在秋收中设立宣传鼓动员、技术辅导员、质量检查员，加强了秋收的领导，提高了秋收的质量。
    秋收生产开始以后，第六生产队的干部为了保证今年秋收又快又细，发动社员推选出社员吴长、吴凤琴、管福、柳云、李发分别做宣传鼓动员、技术辅导员、质量检查员工作。宣传鼓动员负责进行有关搞好秋收的思想教育工作；技术辅导员对社员进行秋收生产的技术指导；质量检查员检查秋收质量，发现质量差的现象直接帮助解决，或者提交给生产队解决。被选为上述“三员”的社员都是政治思想进步，干活技术水平高，工作认真负责。他们在生产队长的领导下，帮助生产队领导上分头进行自己所负责那一方面的工作。
    永发管理区建立起“三员”以后，每一员都兢兢业业的进行自己的工作，使秋收出现一片新气象。宣传鼓动员吴长和吴凤琴，每天劳动休息时都给社员读报，讲解党的关于大办农业大办粮食的方针政策，有时还组织社员随地座谈。这就大大提高了社员的思想认识，增加了搞好秋收的积极性和主动性。比如宣传鼓动员吴长，有一次给社员念在报上发表的省委、省人委关于开展秋收工作指示，七十二岁的周大爷当时就向队长提出了保证搞好秋收的意见，其中一条是建议用辅助劳动力或半劳动力，在非田间作业方面把身体强壮的和技术水平高的劳动力换下来，参加田间收割工作。队长采纳了他的意见，他的儿子也是在这种情况下，由饲养员变成了一个收割能手。这个队的技术辅导员管福和柳云，是群众公认的技术水平较高的两个社员，自从担任技术辅导员这个工作以来，自己一面参加秋收，一面帮助社员提高生产技术。10月4日哈尔滨交通学院二十名学生下地割高粱，许多人刀伸的不正，留槎高矮不一，割下庄稼来又不会捆腰。管福当场就教给他们三种割高粱的方法，接着，他还为同学们作了表演。在管福的帮助下，全队有十三名技术不熟练的青年社员提高了技术，大部分学生也学会了收获中的某些技术活，有力地保证了秋收质量。质量检查员李发和吴凤琴，工作更是兢兢业业，尽职尽责。社员甘财割谷子留槎高，一米远能拉二、三个穗，质量检查员李发在歇气时检查出这个问题之后，当时就告诉他把拉在地里的谷穗拣了起来。到10月5日统计，这个队已割大秋作物一千六百多亩，占大秋作物总面积的65％以上，已拉出七百五十亩，占应拉面积的31％。割出的拉出的这些地，质量都很好。现在社员们正鼓足干劲，继续开展夺秋大战。
    第六生产队的“三员”工作，是直接在队委会、队长的领导下进行的。队委会每次开会都吸收他们参加，除对他们加强思想教育以外，还向他们传达上级党的指示，说明本队当前的生产任务和要求，帮助他们建立经常的工作制度和工作方法。
