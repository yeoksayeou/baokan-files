    Catching Up with Zhang Xiaoquan

    The quality of scissors produced by the Wuxi Tool Factory, which manufactures small hardware products, has caught up with the famous brand.

    This factory regards Hangzhou Zhang Xiaoquan as the target to catch up with. They also assigned Deputy Director Huang Youguang to go deep into the scissors workshop to help workers with joint research. After Director Huang went to the workshop, he first worked with several veteran workers to dissect and analyze Zhang Xiaoquan's scissors and the factory's own scissors, identifying differences and finding key points. They discovered that 24 out of 26 processes were inferior to Zhang Xiaoquan's scissors. The main key problems were: loose seams, uneven tempering of the steel, inconsistent specifications, and poor designs. Then, a "three-way combination" team was formed, mainly with experienced master craftsmen. Based on the quality of Zhang Xiaoquan's scissors, they determined the standards for each process and made standard samples of each process from raw materials to finished products. These were distributed to each team for production according to the standards, and the quality gradually improved.

    However, after the first batch of products was completed, inspection revealed that some products still deviated from the standard samples. After analysis, it was found that this was mainly due to uneven technical skills and the fact that the technology was not yet proficient after the conversion from manual operation to mechanical production. To solve the technical differences, production team leaders were designated to personally serve as technical instructors. At the same time, experience exchange meetings were held to mobilize everyone to conduct joint research so that operations could meet the standard requirements. As a result, nickel-plated scissors reached the standard sample requirements in a very short time. After appraisal by municipal and district industrial and commercial departments and user units, it was unanimously agreed that the quality in major aspects such as the cutting edge, design, and specifications had caught up with the quality level of Zhang Xiaoquan scissors.

    赶上张小泉
    生产五金小商品的无锡工具厂，生产的剪刀的质量已经赶上了名牌。
    这个厂把杭州张小泉作为追赶对象。并确定副厂长黄有光深入剪刀车间，帮助工人共同研究。黄厂长下车间后，先和几个老工人将张小泉的剪刀和本厂的剪刀进行解剖分析，排差异、找关键，在二十六道工序中发现有二十四道不如张小泉剪刀。主要关键是：缝道不紧，钢火不匀，规格不齐，式样不好等。接着就以有经验的老师傅为主，组成“三结合”小组，根据张小泉剪刀的质量，确定了每道工序的标准，并试做出了从原料到成品加工过程中各道工序的标准样品，发给各个小组按标准进行生产，这样，质量逐步提高。
    但是，第一批产品完工后，经过检验，有一部分产品和标准样品还有一定距离，经过分析，发现主要是由于技术水平不齐和手工操作改机械生产后技术还不熟练的缘故。为了解决技术上的差异，就指定生产组长亲自担任技术指导，同时还召开经验交流会，发动大家共同研究，使操作达到标准要求。结果，在很短时间内镀镍剪刀达到标准样品的要求，经市、区工商部门和使用单位的鉴定，一致认为在锋口、式样、规格等主要方面，已赶上张小泉剪刀的质量水平。
