Xinhua News Agency, 2nd – Vice Premier Chen Yi said at a reception today to welcome friends from all walks of life in Japan: "Today, the Chinese and Japanese people need Sino-Japanese friendship, and the people of the world also need Sino-Japanese friendship. U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people. We must unite and overthrow our common enemy, U.S. imperialism."

Today's reception was held by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Li Jiebo, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, to warmly welcome the Japanese delegation from all walks of life visiting China to participate in the National Day celebrations.

Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the reception. In his speech, he warmly praised the heroic struggle of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism. He said: The entire Chinese people admire the Japanese people, who stand at the forefront of the global struggle against U.S. imperialism. Your struggle is arduous, but one day you will achieve final victory.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Second World War ended fifteen years ago, but the United States still occupies Japan, threatening Japan's independence. The United States also occupies China's territory of Taiwan and creates the "Two Chinas" plot. U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people. We must unite and overthrow our common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that Chinese and Japanese friends should pay close attention to the imperialist plot to sow discord between the friendship and unity of our two peoples. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government welcome more Japanese friends to visit China. We also welcome the American people to visit China, but we will never welcome U.S. imperialist elements to visit China.

He emphasized that if the United States does not abandon its imperialist policy towards China, it is absolutely impossible to change the relationship between China and the United States. He said that U.S. imperialism looks very strong on the surface, but it is actually very weak. Cuba can oppose it, Japanese friends can oppose it, and China also has the right to oppose it.

Vice Premier Chen Yi concluded by saying that we warmly welcome more than two hundred Japanese friends to China to participate in the celebration of the 11th anniversary of the founding of our country. He said, "I believe that the day will come when more than two hundred Chinese representatives will celebrate your festival with you in Tokyo."

Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech aroused thunderous applause from the audience.

The reception was filled with a happy atmosphere of unity and friendship. Chinese hosts and Japanese friends gathered together like brothers, fully recounting the militant friendship forged by the people of the two countries. Everyone intimately linked arms and sang loudly in unison, "Tokyo-Beijing," and constantly raised their glasses, toasting to the fighting friendship of the Chinese and Japanese people and to the continued great victory in the struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Guo Moruo spoke at the beginning of the reception. He said that this time, more than two hundred friends from Japan came to China to participate in the National Day celebrations, which brought great encouragement and support to the Chinese people. He expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Japanese friends.

When talking about the fact that foreign guests from more than 70 countries and regions around the world gathered in Beijing to participate in China's National Day celebrations, Guo Moruo said: The U.S. ruling class has exhausted all means to isolate China, but the result is that it has isolated itself.

Guo Moruo said that yesterday, the Chinese and Burmese governments signed the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, which resolved a problem that had not been resolved for more than a hundred years. He believed that Japanese friends would also be happy for us. China is one of the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China is willing to practice peaceful coexistence with all countries with different social systems, and is willing to coexist peacefully and friendly with Japan and any other country on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Guo Moruo warmly congratulated the Japanese people on their brilliant victories in the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle. He said that the victory of the Japanese people is our victory, and it is also the common victory of all peace-loving people in the world. The Chinese people will always stand with the Japanese people, with all peace-loving people in the world, and fight together for the opposition to imperialism and colonialism, for national independence, and for the maintenance of world peace, unyielding and fighting to the end.

Tobe Takeshi, head of the delegation of the National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty in Japan, spoke at the reception on behalf of the Japan Peace Committee, the Japan Asian-African Solidarity Committee, and various organizations participating in the National Council. He warmly praised the achievements made by the Chinese people. He said, "We have seen with our own eyes the great leap forward in China's socialist construction and are deeply moved."

After introducing the heroic struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" at the reception, Tobe Takeshi said: "The Japanese people, as the sovereign of the country, resolutely will not allow the Japanese government to launch a war of aggression that will bring great disasters to the Japanese people and the people of other countries." He stated that in the future, he would continue to work hard to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and continue to fight to completely crush any attempt by imperialism to launch a war of aggression.

He said, "The Chinese and Burmese governments signed the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty in a friendly atmosphere without any military pressure yesterday, which is an epoch-making event in the history of world diplomacy." He said that China and Japan should also further deepen mutual understanding based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, and forever maintain the friendly relations between the two peoples, and jointly advance hand in hand to bring happiness to all mankind.

Hosoi Soichi, Central Executive Committee Member of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union, spoke at the reception on behalf of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union Delegation, the 3rd Delegation of the Japan Private Railway Workers' Union Federation, the Japan Coal Miners' Union Delegation, and the Japan Port Workers' Delegation. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese workers and people for the great support given to the Japanese workers and people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital.

Hosoi Soichi said that through struggle, we have deeply realized that only the unity of the people of the world is the only force to defeat imperialism. He also said that in order to win the victory in the struggle for peace, democracy, independence, and improved living standards, we need the great support of the Chinese workers and people even more, and we need the unity of the Japanese and Chinese people even more.

Murayama Tomoyoshi, head of the Japan Theatre Troupe, spoke on behalf of the Japan-China Friendship Association Delegation, the Japan Journalists Delegation, and the Japan Theatre Troupe. He said that we were warmly received when we were invited to China to participate in the National Day celebrations, which shows that the Japanese people have stood with the peace-loving people of the world. We are treated as comrades-in-arms, and we are by no means isolated. In order for the Japanese people to take a glorious step in the future history of the world, it is even more important that we must deepen friendship with the Chinese people.

Murayama Tomoyoshi also talked about the unity of the Japanese people in the struggle in his speech. He said: The Japanese reactionary government attempted to divide us, and attacked us under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, but we have become more united under a common goal, and each group has contributed its strength in the struggle.

Maeda Minoru, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Japan Democratic Youth League, pointed out that Japanese youth, in the struggle against U.S. imperialism, have become comrades-in-arms with Chinese youth and world youth. He said that Japanese youth have strengthened their confidence in the struggle and are determined to make Japan's political direction move towards the path of peace, democracy, independence, and neutrality. We must continue to fight against U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital to the end.

Maeda Minoru said that we Japanese youth strongly demand the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, resolutely oppose the conspiracy to create "two Chinas", resolutely support the Chinese people in liberating Taiwan, and resolutely support the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism.

When talking about his impressions of his visit to China, Maeda Minoru pointed out that the Chinese people and youth, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, held high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune and advanced bravely, which deeply moved us. Maeda Minoru expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people and youth for their support to the Japanese people and youth in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

    陈毅副总理说，第二次世界大战已经结束十五年了，但美国仍然占领着日本，威胁着日本的独立；美国还霸占着中国的领土台湾，制造“两个中国”的阴谋，美帝国主义是中日两国人民共同的敌人，我们要团结起来，打倒我们共同的敌人美帝国主义。
    陈毅副总理着重说，中日两国朋友要密切注意帝国主义挑拨我们两国人民的友谊和团结的阴谋。中国共产党和中国政府欢迎更多的日本朋友到中国来访问。我们也欢迎美国人民到中国来访问，但我们绝不欢迎美帝国主义分子到中国来访问。

    郭沫若热烈祝贺日本人民在反美爱国斗争中取得了辉煌的胜利。他说，日本人民的胜利就是我们的胜利，也就是全世界爱好和平人民的共同胜利。中国人民永远同日本人民站在一起，同全世界爱好和平的人民站在一起，为反对帝国主义、殖民主义、争取民族独立、维护世界和平而共同斗争，不屈不挠，奋斗到底。

    细井宗一说，我们通过斗争，深切地认识到，只有全世界人民的团结，才是击败帝国主义的唯一的力量。他还说，为了取得和平、民主、独立和改善生活斗争的胜利，我们更需要中国工人和人民的巨大支援，我们更需要日中两国人民的团结。
    日本话剧团团长村山知义代表日中友好协会访华代表团、日本新闻工作者代表团和日本话剧团讲话。他说，我们这次应邀来中国参加国庆观礼，受到了热情的款待，这说明日本人民已经和全世界爱好和平的人民站在一起了。我们是被当作战友来看待的，我们决不是孤立的。为了使日本人民在今后的世界史上迈出光辉的一步，更重要的是，我们必须和中国人民加深友好。
