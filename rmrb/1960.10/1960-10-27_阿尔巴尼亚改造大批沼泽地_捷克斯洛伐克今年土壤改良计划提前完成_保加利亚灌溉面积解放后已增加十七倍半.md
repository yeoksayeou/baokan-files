Xinhua News Agency, Tirana. According to the Albanian Telegraph Agency, a large area of marshland between the Mati and Ishëm rivers in northern Albania has been transformed. In the past three years, 50 hectares of marshland have been drained, and by the end of this year, another 4,000 hectares of marshland will be turned into fertile land.

	Beets, corn, wheat, and other crops planted on this newly reclaimed land have yielded bumper harvests. Agricultural workers have also planted grapes here, and there are plans to expand the grape-growing area to 200 hectares in the future. Pastures have also seen significant development. So far, 200 dairy cows, over 3,700 pigs, and over 2,600 sheep have been raised here.

	Currently, 1,500 workers are employed on the farms here. A new city is beginning to emerge. The Vore-Milo railway, which is under construction, will pass through here, and a giant chemical-metallurgical complex will be built not far from here.

	For nearly a century, this plain between the Mati and Ishëm rivers had been flooded and turned into marshland due to river flooding. Three years ago, the people here enthusiastically responded to the call of the Albanian Labor Party and the government and began work to transform the marshland. So far, a 30-kilometer canal has been dug, a new riverbed has been straightened, a reservoir has been built, and two 22-kilometer flood-control dikes have been built on the banks of the Mati and Ishëm rivers. Except for a few technical projects that are not yet completed, the marshland transformation work has been basically completed.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague. Czechoslovakia has completed its annual soil improvement plan 17% ahead of schedule. By September 20, soil improvement work had been carried out on more than 37,000 hectares of land nationwide.

	Soil improvement activities have been widely carried out throughout Czechoslovakia. In addition to large-scale soil improvement projects invested in by the state, smaller irrigation and drainage projects are carried out by soil improvement cooperatives composed of unified agricultural cooperatives and state farms in various regions. They are engaged in improving soil on about half of the country's arable land. Employees of industrial enterprises in various regions, members of the Czechoslovak Youth League, and soldiers of the People's Army also enthusiastically support agricultural workers. By September 20, they had completed a total of 2,663,000 shifts of voluntary labor.

	Czechoslovak farmers have also achieved significant results in fertilizer accumulation, which is of great significance for soil improvement. As early as the beginning of July, the plan to accumulate 10 million cubic meters of compost throughout the year was completed ahead of schedule. By September 20, the annual plan had been overfulfilled by 16.6%.

	During the Third Five-Year Plan period (1961-1965), Czechoslovakia's soil improvement work will be further developed. The state's investment in this area will reach 4.5 billion crowns, 160% more than the investment during the Second Five-Year Plan period. Before 1965, stagnant water will be drained from approximately 200,000 hectares of land, and approximately 170,000 hectares of land will be irrigated; they account for 19% of the total cultivated land area.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia. At present, the irrigated area in Bulgaria is over 650,000 hectares, which is seventeen and a half times more than before 1944.

	Since the establishment of the people's regime sixteen years ago, Bulgaria has carried out tremendous work in water conservancy construction and soil improvement. Many irrigation systems, reservoirs, and soil improvement projects have been built in various regions. These projects are of great significance in expanding cultivated land area and increasing production. For example, thanks to the construction of a modern irrigation system, the waters of the Danube River can be used to irrigate more than 24,000 hectares of land during the dry season. In the northeastern region of Bulgaria, where crops were often damaged by drought in the past, agricultural workers can now use groundwater for irrigation due to the completion of irrigation canals, thereby guaranteeing harvests.

	In this regard, in addition to state investment, agricultural cooperatives have also invested in the construction of approximately 1,500 reservoirs of various sizes, irrigating an area of 300,000 hectares.

	It is estimated that by 1965, the irrigated area in Bulgaria will reach 2 million hectares, accounting for 43% of the total cultivated land.

	As a result of water conservancy construction and soil improvement, during the first and second five-year plan periods, wheat and corn alone increased production by approximately 220,000 tons.

### 阿尔巴尼亚改造大批沼泽地  捷克斯洛伐克今年土壤改良计划提前完成  保加利亚灌溉面积解放后已增加十七倍半

    阿尔巴尼亚改造大批沼泽地
    捷克斯洛伐克今年土壤改良计划提前完成
    保加利亚灌溉面积解放后已增加十七倍半
    新华社地拉那讯　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚北部麦蒂河和伊什米河之间的一大片沼泽地已经改变了原来的面貌。三年来，人们已经使五十公顷的沼泽地解除水患，到今年年底还将有四千公顷沼泽地变为良田。
    在这块新改造的土地上，种植的甜菜、玉米、小麦等，都获得了丰收。农业劳动者还在这里种了葡萄，今后计划把种植葡萄的面积扩展到二百公顷。牧场也有很大的发展。到目前为止，这里已经饲养了二百头奶牛、三千七百多头猪和二千六百多只绵羊。
    目前这里的农场已经有一千五百名工人在工作。一座新的城市开始在这里出现。已经开始动工的沃雷—米洛铁路将经过这里，离这里不远还将建立一座巨型的化学冶金联合企业。
    近百年来，麦蒂河和伊什米河之间的这块平原，由于河水泛滥而成了被水淹没的沼泽地。三年前这里的人民热烈响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府的号召，展开了改造沼泽地的工作。到现在为止，这里已经开凿了一条三十公里长的运河，修整了一条新河床，建立了一个蓄水库，并且在麦蒂河和伊什米河岸上修建了两条二十二公里长的防洪大堤。现在除了几件技术性的工程还未完工以外，沼泽的改造工作已经基本完成。
    据新华社布拉格讯　捷克斯洛伐克今年土壤改良的年度计划已经以超额17％提前完成。到9月20日为止，全国已经有三万七千多公顷的土地进行了土壤改良工作。
    捷克斯洛伐克全国各地广泛展开了改良土壤的活动。除了国家投资进行巨大的土壤改良工程外，规模较小的灌溉和排水工程则由各地的统一农业合作社和国营农场组成的土壤改良合作社来进行。它们在全国一半左右的可耕地上从事改良土壤的工作。各地工业企业的职工、捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟盟员和人民军战士等也热情地支援农业劳动者。到9月20日为止，他们一共进行了二百六十六万三千多个班的义务劳动。
    捷克斯洛伐克农民在积肥方面也获得了重大的成绩，这对土壤改良具有重大的意义。还在7月初，全年堆积一千万立方米堆肥的计划就提前实现了。到9月20日，年度计划已超额完成16.6％。
    在第三个五年计划期间（1961—1965年），捷克斯洛伐克的土壤改良工作将有进一步的发展。国家在这方面的投资将达四十五亿克朗，比在第二个五年计划期间的投资多160％。在1965年以前，将在二十万公顷左右土地上排干积水，十七万公顷左右的土地将得到灌溉；它们总共占全部农田面积的19％。
    据新华社索非亚讯　目前保加利亚的灌溉面积在六十五万公顷以上，即比1944年以前增加了十七倍半。
    保加利亚自人民政权建立十六年来，在兴修水利、改良土壤方面进行了巨大的工作。各地建成了许多灌溉系统、水库和土壤改良工程。这些工程在扩大耕地面积和增加生产方面具有很大意义。例如，由于建成了现代化灌溉系统，可以在干旱季节里利用多瑙河的河水灌溉两万四千多公顷的土地。在保加利亚东北部地区，过去由于干旱常常使庄稼受到损失，现在由于已修成了灌溉渠，农业劳动者可以利用地下水浇地，从而保证了收成。
    在这方面除了国家投资以外，农业合作社也投资兴建了约一千五百个大小水库，灌溉面积达三十万公顷。
    预计到1965年，保加利亚灌溉面积将达二百万公顷，占全部耕地的43％。
    由于兴修水利、改良土壤的结果，在第一个和第二个五年计划期间，仅小麦和玉蜀黍就增产了约二十二万吨。
