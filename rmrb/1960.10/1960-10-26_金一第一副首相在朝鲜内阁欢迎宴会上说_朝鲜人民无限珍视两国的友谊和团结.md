Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 25th: The full text of the speech by Kim Il, First Vice Premier of the North Korean Cabinet, at the banquet held by the North Korean Cabinet to welcome the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to North Korea, is as follows: Respected Comrade Vice Premier He Long! Respected Comrades of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation! Dear Comrades and Friends!

    Today, as we welcome the 10th anniversary of the entry of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers into Korea to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, our People's Army and all working people of our country commemorate this day as a festival of eternal friendship with the fraternal Chinese people.

    At this moment when our people are welcoming this deeply meaningful anniversary, we are infinitely excited to have our close Chinese comrades-in-arms, who have shared joys and sorrows and lived and died together in the long and arduous struggle against common enemies, visiting our country. First of all, in the name of the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, and the entire Korean people, I warmly welcome our closest friends—the comrades of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to North Korea headed by Marshal He Long, and through the comrades of the delegation, I extend warm congratulations and fraternal greetings to the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the entire Chinese people.

    Ten years ago, when our people were engaged in a difficult struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the fraternal Chinese people, holding high the banner of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, sent their outstanding sons and daughters to aid our people with their blood.

    The enemy was fierce, and the war was unprecedentedly intense, but no trials or difficulties could frustrate the firm will of the Korean and Chinese people, who are closely united in the socialist family and under the banner of proletarian internationalism.

    The Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army and the entire Korean people, displayed unparalleled heroism and continuously carried out heroic struggles against the aggressors until the day of glorious victory, establishing immortal great achievements. The brilliant victory achieved by the Korean and Chinese people in the Korean War is a great victory for proletarian internationalism and a manifestation of the vitality of the invincible militant friendship between the Korean and Chinese people.

    For eight years, the true internationalist fighters—the brave soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers—shared weal and woe with our people in the fierce flames of war and in the arduous post-war reconstruction struggle, dedicating all their strength to the freedom and happiness of the Korean people, and making great contributions to further strengthening the friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese people. Our people will never forget the great achievements left by the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea.

    From the time they suffered the insults and oppression of imperialism until today when they have become masters of their country, the Korean and Chinese people have always been old comrades-in-arms who have cooperated wholeheartedly in the common struggle against aggressors, and they are close brothers who are eternally united by the same ideals and the same goals.

    The friendship and solidarity between our two peoples continues to exert great vitality in our people's struggle for peace and socialism today, and it has been further consolidated and developed.

    In the post-war period, the Chinese people, together with the people of fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union, have given our people tremendous material assistance and actively supported our people's just struggle.

    Recently, the governments of North Korea and China signed an agreement on the Chinese government providing our country with huge long-term loans, supplying our country with complete sets of equipment, and providing technical assistance. This new and huge assistance given to us by the Chinese people will play a great role in our people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the construction of socialism.

    The deepening friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese people not only promotes the common prosperity of our two peoples, but also makes a great contribution to strengthening the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and safeguarding peace and security in Asia. The Korean people infinitely treasure the friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese people and will do everything possible to consolidate and develop friendship, solidarity, and close cooperation with the Chinese people.

    Dear Comrades and Friends!

    Today, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the great Chinese people, holding high the banner of the General Line, are continuing to launch a great leap forward movement in socialist construction, rapidly transforming the formerly backward China into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and advanced science and culture.

    China's prosperity and its growing power have made a great contribution to strengthening the socialist camp and peace-loving forces throughout the world, and greatly encouraged the liberation struggles of oppressed people and dependent nations around the world. The Korean people rejoice in every achievement made by the Chinese people as if it were their own.

    In the post-war period, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il Sung, the Korean people rapidly restored the people's economy, which had been severely damaged by the war, and achieved great successes in socialist construction. The struggle of the people in South Korea against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys continues to surge, and in South Korea, U.S. imperialism's colonial plunder policy has suffered further bankruptcy.

    Now, the ferocious U.S. imperialists, struggling to maintain their disintegrating colonial rule, continue to carry out aggressive conspiracies against peace and socialism. However, thanks to the struggle of our united peoples, any conspiracy of the imperialists will be bankrupted, and we will surely achieve final victory.

    The socialist camp and the world's peace-loving forces, closely united with the Soviet Union at the center, have been further strengthened and have overwhelmed the forces of war and imperialism. Our people will continue to hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, closely unite with the people of fraternal socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and China, resolutely carry out the struggle against the U.S. imperialist aggressors, and will be loyal to the common cause of peace and socialism.

    I propose a toast,

    To the eternal friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese people,

    To the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,

    To the boundless prosperity of the fraternal Chinese people,

    To the health of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong,

    To the health of the comrades of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to North Korea headed by Comrade He Long,

    To the health of all comrades and friends present here,

    Cheers!

    金一第一副首相在朝鲜内阁欢迎宴会上说
    朝鲜人民无限珍视两国的友谊和团结
    新华社平壤25日电　朝鲜内阁第一副首相金一在朝鲜内阁举行的欢迎中华人民共和国访朝军事友好代表团的宴会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的贺龙副总理同志！尊敬的中国军事友好代表团的同志们！亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    今天，我们迎接英雄的中国人民志愿军抗美援朝入朝参战十周年，我们的人民军队和我国全体劳动人民把这一天当作同兄弟般的中国人民的永恒友谊的节日来纪念。
    正当我国人民迎接这个具有深刻意义的纪念日的时候，在长期的反对共同敌人的艰苦斗争中同甘苦共生死的亲密的中国战友们来到我国进行访问，这使我们感到无限的兴奋。首先，我以朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民的名义热烈地欢迎我们最亲密的朋友——以贺龙元帅为团长的中国访朝军事友好代表团的同志们，并通过代表团的同志们向中国人民解放军官兵和全体中国人民致以热烈的祝贺和兄弟般的问候。
    十年前，在我国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗而进行艰苦斗争的时候，兄弟般的中国人民高举抗美援朝的旗帜，派遣自己的优秀儿女以鲜血援助了我国人民。
    敌人凶恶，战争空前激烈，但是任何考验和困难也没有能够挫折在社会主义大家庭中和在无产阶级国际主义旗帜下紧密地团结起来的朝中两国人民的坚强意志。
    中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民军和全体朝鲜人民一起发挥了无比的英雄主义，直至取得光荣的胜利那天为止，连续进行反对侵略者的英雄斗争，树立了不朽的伟大功勋。在朝鲜战争中，朝中两国人民取得的辉煌胜利，是无产阶级国际主义的伟大胜利，是不可战胜的朝中两国人民战斗友谊的生命力的表现。
    八年中，真正的国际主义战士——中国人民志愿军勇士们，在激烈的战争火焰中和在战后艰苦的恢复建设斗争中，和我国人民同甘共苦，为朝鲜人民的自由和幸福竭尽了自己的全部力量，为进一步加强朝中两国人民的友谊团结作出了巨大的贡献。我国人民将永不会忘记中国人民志愿军留在朝鲜的丰功伟绩。
    从遭受帝国主义的侮辱和压迫的时候起直到成为国家主人的今天，朝中两国人民一向是在反对侵略者的共同斗争中竭力合作的老战友，是以同一的思想和同一的目的永远结合起来的亲密兄弟。
    我们两国人民的友谊和团结，今天在我们人民为和平和社会主义的斗争中继续发挥巨大的生命力，并得到了进一步的巩固和发展。
    战后时期，中国人民同以苏联为首的兄弟国家人民一起，给予我国人民以巨大的物质援助，积极地支持我国人民的正义斗争。
    最近，朝中两国政府签订了关于中国政府给予我国巨大的长期贷款、供应我国成套设备和提供技术援助的协定。中国人民给予我们的这一新的巨大援助，在我国人民和平统一祖国和建设社会主义的斗争中，将起莫大的作用。
    朝中两国人民的日益加深的友谊和团结，不但促进我们两国人民的共同繁荣，而且对加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的大团结和保障亚洲的和平和安全，都作出了巨大的贡献。朝鲜人民无限珍视朝中两国人民的友谊团结，将尽一切力量来巩固和发展同中国人民的友谊团结和紧密合作。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    今天，伟大的中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英明领导下，高举总路线的旗帜，继续展开着社会主义建设的大跃进运动，使过去落后的中国正在迅速地转变为具有现代工业、现代农业和先进科学文化的社会主义强国。
    中国的繁荣及其威力的增长，为社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平力量的加强作出了巨大的贡献，并且大大地鼓舞全世界被压迫人民和附属国人民的解放斗争。朝鲜人民像对待自己的成就一样，为中国人民所取得的每一个成就而高兴。
    战后时期，朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的领导下，迅速地恢复了被战争严重破坏的人民经济，在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就。朝鲜南部人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争正在继续高涨，在朝鲜南部，美帝国主义的殖民地掠夺政策遭到进一步的破产。
    现在，凶恶的美帝国主义者，为了维持其分崩离析的殖民统治制度而挣扎，继续进行反对和平和社会主义的侵略阴谋。但是，由于团结起来的我们人民的斗争，帝国主义者的任何阴谋必将遭到破产，我们一定会取得最后胜利。
    以苏联为中心紧密地团结起来的社会主义阵营和世界爱好和平的力量，得到了进一步的壮大，并且压倒了战争和帝国主义的势力。我国人民将继续高举马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，同苏联、中国等兄弟的社会主义国家的人民紧密地团结在一起，坚决进行反对美帝国主义侵略者的斗争，并将忠实于和平和社会主义的共同事业。
    我提议，
    为朝中两国人民的永恒的友谊团结，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，
  为兄弟的中国人民的无限繁荣，
    为以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府领导人的健康，
    为以贺龙同志为首的中国访朝军事友好代表团成员同志们的健康，
    为在座的各位同志们和朋友们的健康，
    干杯！
