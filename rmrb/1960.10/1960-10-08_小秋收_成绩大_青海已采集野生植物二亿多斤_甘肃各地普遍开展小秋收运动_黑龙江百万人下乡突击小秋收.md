Xinhua News Agency Report: Qinghai Province has collected over 200 million jin of various wild plants in the "small autumn harvest" movement.

According to surveys, there are more than 540 kinds of wild plants in Qinghai Province that can be collected and utilized in large quantities. This year, many counties and people's communes have conducted further investigations and research on local wild plants. Based on the variety, yield, and maturity time of wild plants, they have effectively utilized slack farming time to organize labor for collection. After investigation and research, the CCP湟源 (Huangyuan) County Committee took advantage of the favorable time before the spring wheat harvest to organize the masses to rush to collect wild black oats, resulting in the collection of more than 500,000 jin of black oats in half a month.

While collecting in large quantities, various localities have also paid attention to the processing and purchasing of wild plants.

Xinhua News Agency Report: Various parts of Gansu Province are actively carrying out the "small autumn harvest" movement. Up to now, eighteen counties and cities in Tianshui, Dingxi, Zhangye, Linxia and other regions and autonomous prefectures have collected a total of more than 130,000 dan of various wild fibers, oilseeds, starch, tannin raw materials, etc.

In order to collect the various wild plants distributed in the agricultural, pastoral, and forest areas throughout the province in a timely manner, party organizations at all levels in Gansu established special agencies as early as August to arrange the "small autumn harvest" work. The "Develop Wanchaun Mountain" work team of the CCP Tianshui Prefectural Committee went deep into key areas for surveying, and relied on commune members who collect firewood and graze livestock to further clarify the wild plant resources distributed in the Longnan mountainous area. Based on the urgent need to carry out both the "three autumns" and the "small autumn harvest," it organized office cadres, students, herders, etc. and rural semi-labor forces to rush to collect, ensuring that both the "big autumn harvest" and the "small autumn harvest" were carried out without fail. Due to early preparations, Huicheng, Wudu, Longxi, Shandan and other counties recovered more than 18,400 dan of wild starch and oilseeds in a little over a month.

With the close cooperation of commercial, grain, and industrial departments, various localities have promptly processed the large amounts of wild raw materials collected.

Harbin Report, October 7th: 1,080,000 workers, cadres, and students from various cities in Heilongjiang Province have gone to the countryside to help with the autumn harvest and "small autumn harvest." Currently, this army of more than one million people who have gone to the countryside are working with farmers to carry out the "small autumn harvest" movement before the large-scale autumn harvest is fully underway in various places.

In order to give full play to the combat role of the autumn harvest army, all parts of Heilongjiang have organized the people participating in the autumn harvest into militia companies, militia battalions, militia regiments, and militia divisions according to the militia organization.

In organizing urban workers to participate in the autumn harvest movement, various places in Heilongjiang Province have also organized sugar factory workers to help farmers harvest sugar beets, winery workers to harvest wild grapes, and textile workers to harvest wild fibers, which has strengthened the connection between industrial and agricultural production and accelerated the harvesting of industrial raw materials.

These autumn harvest troops eat, live, work, and consult with the farmers in the countryside. In order not to increase the burden on the farmers, they bring their own grain rations and vegetable money. Thanks to the support of this autumn harvest army, the enthusiasm of the farmers has been greatly boosted. Since the support army was put into production, the harvest of many wild products in the Songhua River area has increased by more than double.

    小秋收　成绩大
    青海已采集野生植物二亿多斤
    甘肃各地普遍开展小秋收运动
    黑龙江百万人下乡突击小秋收
    据新华社讯　青海省在“小秋收”运动中，已采集各种野生植物两亿多斤。
    据调查，青海省可以大量采集和利用的野生植物有五百四十多种。今年，许多县和人民公社都对当地的野生植物作了进一步的调查研究，根据野生植物的品种、产量和成熟时间，有效地利用农闲时间组织劳力采集。中共湟源县委经过调查研究，利用春小麦收割尚未开始的有利时机组织群众突击采集野生黑燕麦，结果半个月收了黑燕麦五十多万斤。
    在大量采集的同时，各地还注意野生植物的加工和收购工作。
    据新华社讯　甘肃省各地积极开展“小秋收”运动。到目前为止，天水、定西、张掖、临夏等专区、自治州，有十八个县、市已采集各种野生纤维、油料、淀粉、栲胶原料等共十三万多担。
    为了把分布在全省各农区、牧区、林区的多种野生植物及时采集回来，甘肃各级党的组织早在8月间就层层成立专门机构，对“小秋收”工作作了安排。中共天水地委“开发万宝山”工作组深入重点地区勘察，依靠樵采、放牧的社员，进一步摸清了分布在陇南山区的野生植物资源。根据“三秋”和“小秋收”都急需开展的情况，组织机关干部、学生、放牧人员等和农村半劳动力突击采集，做到了“大秋收”、“小秋收”两不误。徽成、武都、陇西、山丹等县由于准备早，一个多月内收回野生淀粉、油料一万八千四百多担。
    各地在商业、粮食、工业等部门的密切配合下，对采集回来的大量野生原料及时进行了加工。
    本报哈尔滨7日电　黑龙江省各城市的一百零八万工人、干部、学生下乡，帮助农村秋收和“小秋收”。目前这一百多万下到农村的秋收大军，在各地尚未全面进行大秋收之前正和农民一道开展“小秋收”运动。
    黑龙江各地为了充分发挥秋收大军的战斗作用，都按民兵组织把参加秋收的人编成民兵连、民兵营、民兵团和民兵师。
    黑龙江省各地在组织城市工人参加秋收运动中，并且组织糖厂工人帮助农民收获甜菜，酒厂工人收获山葡萄，纺织工人收获野生纤维，密切了工农业生产的联系，加快了工业原料的收获进度。
    这些秋收大军在农村里跟农民同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。为了不增加农民的负担，他们都自带粮票、菜金。由于这批秋收大军的支援，大大鼓舞了农民的干劲。松花江地区自从支援大军投入生产以后，许多野生产品的收获量增加一倍以上。
