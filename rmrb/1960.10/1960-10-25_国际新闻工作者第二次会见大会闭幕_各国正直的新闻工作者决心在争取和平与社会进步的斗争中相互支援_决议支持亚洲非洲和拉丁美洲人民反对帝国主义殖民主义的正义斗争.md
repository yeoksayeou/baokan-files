Xinhua News Agency, Baden, October 23rd: The Second Meeting of International Journalists successfully concluded on the 22nd in Baden, Austria. The meeting, which began on the 18th, achieved great success in strengthening the unity of journalists from various countries on the basis of opposing imperialism and colonialism, striving for world peace, national independence, democratic freedom, and social progress.

After several days of frank and full exchange of views, 279 journalists from 64 countries, with different political views and religious beliefs, reached consensus on many important political issues and professional issues related to journalists. At the plenary session on the evening of the 22nd, they adopted a series of resolutions. These resolutions expressed the determination of honest journalists from various countries to dedicate themselves to the cause of peace and social progress and to support each other in the common struggle, reflecting the strong will of journalists from various countries, especially Asian, African, and Latin American countries, to oppose imperialism and colonialism.

The resolution passed by the conference "Concerning the Status of the Press and Broadcasting in Less Developed Countries" stated that all journalists participating in this meeting "unanimously condemn colonialism and imperialism, as well as racial discrimination. They declare that the complete elimination of colonialism—the shame of our time—is the sacred responsibility of every journalist (newspaper and radio worker). Only by strengthening the struggle of all peoples and completely eliminating imperialism and colonialism can we create the necessary conditions for the development of newspapers, radio stations, and television in countries that have recently shaken off colonialism and countries that are still fighting for their national liberation."

The resolution condemned "all military treaties aimed at achieving new conquests and enslavement of peoples of all countries," and called on world public opinion to beware of imperialism using any new methods of exploitation to obstruct the liberation struggle of oppressed peoples, and pointed out that special vigilance should be raised against neo-colonialism. The resolution expressed support for the just struggles of the people of Algeria, Cuba, and the Congo. It called on journalists around the world to contribute all their strength to defend the oppressed peoples and for their liberation.

The conference also suggested that the International Committee launch an "International Day of Solidarity of Journalists of All Countries with the Peoples of All Countries Still Suffering from Imperialist Exploitation and Barbaric Oppression."

The resolution adopted by the conference on the social mission of journalists pointed out that "journalists should work to oppose the Cold War, strive to ease international tensions, strive for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, strive for disarmament, strive for freedom and independence, strive for national unity, strive for the peaceful unification of divided countries, oppose colonialism, oppose the suppression of democratic rights, oppose racial discrimination, and oppose imperialism."

The conference adopted a resolution on striving for professional facilitation for journalists, expressing opposition to news monopolies, condemning the persecution of journalists, and calling for strengthening cooperation between journalists from various countries.

The conference also adopted a resolution on the Algerian issue, condemning the French government's cruel colonial war against the Algerian people, and paying tribute to the Algerian people who are fighting heroically for freedom and national independence.

The conference also adopted a resolution demanding the elimination of obstacles hindering mutual contact between journalists in North and South Korea and North and South Vietnam, as well as the free exchange between Japanese journalists and Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese journalists, and pointed out that these obstacles are caused by the policies of the South Korean, South Vietnamese and Japanese authorities, as well as the foreign troops stationed in South Korea.

The conference also decided to expand the International Cooperation Committee of Journalists in order to further promote international cooperation among journalists and prepare for the Third World Meeting of Journalists.

The conference also decided to send telegrams separately to support Spanish democratic journalists, demanding that the Franco authorities stop persecuting them; to support Latin American news agencies in their struggle to uphold their cause; to support South Vietnamese democratic journalists, condemning the South Vietnamese authorities for persecuting them; to express solidarity with Glezo, Aleg, and Herlu, demanding the immediate restoration of their freedom.

The representatives of African journalists participating in this meeting, after consultation during the meeting, have decided to establish a Journalists' Cooperation Committee. They and the representatives of Asian countries have jointly decided to prepare for the convening of a conference of Asian and African journalists as soon as possible. All this shows the desire of Asian and African journalists to further strengthen unity.

    据新华社巴登23日电　国际新闻工作者第二次会见大会22日在奥地利的巴登胜利闭幕。从18日开始举行的这次会见在加强各国新闻工作者在反对帝国主义、殖民主义，争取世界和平，争取民族独立、民主自由和社会进步的基础上的团结方面取得了巨大的成就。
    来自六十四个国家的二百七十九名具有不同政治见解和宗教信仰的新闻工作者，经过几天坦率和充分地交换意见，在许多重要政治问题和有关新闻工作者的职业问题上取得了一致。他们在22日晚上的全体大会上通过了一系列的决议。这些决议表达了各国正直的新闻工作者致力于争取和平和社会进步事业以及他们在共同斗争中互相支援的决心，反映了各国，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国新闻工作者反对帝国主义和殖民主义的强烈意志。
    大会通过的“关于不大发达国家的报刊和广播事业的地位的”决议说，参加这次会见的全体新闻工作者“一致谴责殖民主义和帝国主义以及种族歧视。他们宣布，彻底消除殖民主义——我们时代的耻辱——是每一个新闻工作者（报纸和电台工作者）的神圣责任。只有加强各国人民的斗争和彻底清除帝国主义和殖民主义，才能为最近摆脱殖民主义的国家以及仍为自己的民族解放而斗争的国家中的报纸、电台和电视的发展创造必要的条件”。
    决议谴责“旨在实现对各国人民进行新的征服和奴役的一切军事条约”，并且号召世界舆论提防帝国主义使用任何新的剥削方式来阻挠受压迫的各国人民的解放斗争，并指出特别要提高对新殖民主义的警惕。决议表示支持阿尔及利亚、古巴、刚果人民的正义斗争。号召全世界的新闻工作者为维护受压迫的各国人民，为他们的解放贡献全部力量。
    大会还建议由国际委员会发起举行“世界各国新闻工作者声援仍然遭受帝国主义者剥削和野蛮压迫的各国人民国际日”。
    大会通过的关于新闻工作者的社会使命的决议指出，“新闻工作者应当为反对冷战、争取和缓国际紧张局势，争取不同社会制度的国家之间的和平共处，争取裁军，争取自由和独立、争取民族团结、争取被分裂的国家的和平统一、反对殖民主义、反对镇压民主权利、反对种族歧视和帝国主义而工作。”
    大会通过了关于争取新闻工作者职业便利的决议，表示反对新闻垄断，谴责对新闻工作者的迫害，并号召加强各国新闻工作者之间的合作。
    大会还通过关于阿尔及利亚问题的决议，谴责法国政府对阿尔及利亚人民进行的残酷的殖民主义战争，并向为争取自由和民族独立而英勇斗争的阿尔及利亚人民致敬。
    大会还通过了决议，要求消除阻碍朝鲜南北部和越南南北方新闻工作者相互接触，以及日本新闻工作者和中国，朝鲜，越南新闻工作者自由交往的障碍，并指出这些障碍是南朝鲜、越南南方和日本当局，以及南朝鲜的外国驻军的政策所造成的。
    大会并决定扩大新闻工作者国际合作委员会，以便进一步促进新闻工作国际合作和筹备第三次世界新闻工作者的会见。
    大会并决定分别致电支援西班牙民主新闻工作者，要求佛朗哥当局停止对他们的迫害；支持拉丁美洲通讯社为坚持自己的事业而进行的斗争；支援越南南方民主新闻工作者，谴责越南南方当局对他们的迫害；声援格列索斯，阿勒格和赫卢，要求立即恢复他们的自由。
