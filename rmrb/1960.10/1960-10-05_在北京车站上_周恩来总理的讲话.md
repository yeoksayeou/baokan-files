Xinhua News Agency, October 4th. The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at Beijing Railway Station to bid farewell to General Ne Win is as follows:

Esteemed General Ne Win, esteemed Burmese guests, friends, comrades:

Now, General Ne Win and his wife, along with some distinguished members of the Burmese government delegation, are about to leave Beijing to pay friendly visits to various parts of our country. You will continue to sow the seeds of "Paukphaw" (fraternal) friendship in various parts of our country, which will allow Sino-Burmese friendship to continue to blossom with even more new flowers in other regions of our country. At this moment of parting, please allow me to express, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, our heartfelt gratitude once again for this friendly visit!

General, Burmese guests, during your visit, we warmly held the completion ceremony of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Building. As we celebrate this great event between our two countries, I cannot fail to mention the efforts and contributions of General Ne Win. In January of this year, General Ne Win signed the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Agreement on Border Issues with our government in Beijing, paving the way for a swift and smooth resolution of the border issue. The signing of the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty is a victory for the friendship and unity of the Chinese and Burmese people, a victory for the friendship and unity of the Asian people, and a victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The further development and consolidation of friendly relations between China and Burma cannot but be a heavy blow to the imperialist schemes of provocation. Today, as I bid farewell to General Ne Win for his friendly visits to various parts of our country, I, on behalf of the Chinese government and in my personal name, express my gratitude and respect to General Ne Win for his valuable contributions to the cause of Sino-Burmese friendship.

I wish General Ne Win and his wife, as well as the distinguished Burmese guests, good health and a safe journey. See you in Rangoon.

    在北京车站上
    周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社4日讯　周恩来总理在北京车站欢送奈温将军的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的奈温将军阁下，尊敬的缅甸贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    现在，奈温将军阁下和夫人以及缅甸政府代表团一部分贵宾，就要离开北京到我国各地进行友好访问。你们到我国各地继续撒播“胞波”情谊的种子，这将使中缅友谊在我国其他地方继续开放更多的新的花朵。在这临别的时候，请允许我代表中国人民和中国政府，对你们这次友好访问，再一次表示衷心的感谢！
    将军阁下，缅甸贵宾们，在你们这次访问的期间，我们热烈地举行了中缅两国友好大厦的落成典礼。在我们欢庆中缅两国之间的这件大喜事的时候，我不能不提到奈温将军阁下的努力和贡献。今年1月，奈温将军阁下在北京同我国政府签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和关于边界问题的协定，为迅速而顺利地解决边界问题铺平了道路。这次中缅边界条约的签订，是中缅两国人民友好团结的胜利，是亚洲人民友好团结的胜利，也是和平共处五项原则的胜利。中缅两国友好关系的进一步发展和巩固，不能不是对于帝国主义挑拨阴谋的一个沉重打击。今天，在欢送奈温将军阁下到我国各地进行友好访问的时候，我代表中国政府并且以我个人的名义，向奈温将军阁下对中缅友好事业所作的宝贵贡献，表示感谢和敬意。
    祝奈温将军阁下和夫人以及缅甸贵宾们的身体健康，旅途平安。仰光再见。
