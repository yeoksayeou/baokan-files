Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, October 2nd: The people of Guinea joyfully celebrated the second anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Guinea. On October 2nd, the Guinean capital, Conakry, was filled with a festive atmosphere. In every corner of the city, and on the streets, the red, yellow, and green flag of the Republic of Guinea flew everywhere.

That morning, a parade and military review were held in Conakry. After the parade, Guinean President Sékou Touré delivered a speech. In his speech, the President reviewed the achievements Guinea had made in the economic field and also spoke about the African situation.

President Sékou Touré said that in the past two years, imperialists and their servants in Africa have repeatedly attempted to divide Africa, some in order to maintain colonial privileges, and some in order to gain a foothold in Africa. However, it is certain that the revolutionary trade union movement has become an unstoppable trend, and conscious workers continue to organize united actions, fighting bravely, resolutely, and confidently to stop all policies of exploitation and oppression of the working masses.

Speaking about the situation in the Congo, he pointed out that it is necessary to quickly stop the attitude and activities of the United Nations representatives in the Congo who are acting against the independence and territorial integrity of this young African country.

Xinhua News Agency, October 2nd: Liu Changsheng, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, sent a telegram to Guinean President Sékou Touré on September 30th, congratulating the Republic of Guinea on its second anniversary.

The telegram said: "On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Guinea, I would like to express my warmest congratulations to you, and through you to the fraternal Guinean people, on behalf of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association!

"The Chinese people are very pleased to see that in the past two years, under your leadership and the leadership of the Government of the Republic of Guinea, the Guinean people have achieved a series of major achievements and victories in safeguarding national independence, developing national economy and cultural undertakings, and eliminating the legacy of colonialism, which have strongly supported and encouraged the national independence movement of the African people and the struggle of the people of the world against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace. What is particularly encouraging is that the profound friendship established between the Chinese and Guinean people in the common struggle against imperialism and in mutual cooperation in building their respective countries has entered a new historical period due to your visit to China. On the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the friendly relations between the Chinese and Guinean people will continue to develop!

"I wish the Republic of Guinea prosperity and its people happiness!"

"May the friendship between the Chinese and Guinean people last forever!"

    刘长胜电贺几内亚共和国国庆
    新华社科纳克里2日电　几内亚人民欢乐地庆祝几内亚共和国独立两周年。10月2日，几内亚首都科纳克里洋溢着一片节日景象。在这个城市的每一个角落，在大街上，红、黄、绿三色的几内亚共和国国旗到处飘扬。
    这一天上午，科纳克里举行了游行和阅兵。游行以后，几内亚总统塞古·杜尔发表了演说。总统在演说中回顾了几内亚在经济方面所取得的成就，并且谈到了非洲局势。
    塞古·杜尔总统说，在过去两年中，帝国主义者及其在非洲的仆从一再企图分裂非洲，其中有的是为了保持殖民特权，有的是为了在非洲插足。但是，肯定的是，革命的工会运动已经成为势不可当的潮流，觉悟的劳动者继续不断组织联合一致的行动，勇敢、坚决、满怀信心地进行斗争，争取制止一切剥削和压迫劳动群众的政策。
    他在谈到刚果局势时指出：必须迅速制止联合国代表在刚果所采取的反对这个年青非洲国家的独立和领土完整的态度和活动。
    新华社2日讯　中国非洲人民友好协会会长刘长胜在9月30日打电报给几内亚共和国塞古·杜尔总统，祝贺几内亚共和国建国两周年。
    电报说：“在几内亚共和国建国两周年之际，我谨代表中国非洲人民友好协会，向您，并通过您向兄弟般的几内亚人民，表示最热烈的祝贺！
    “中国人民非常高兴地看到，两年来，几内亚人民在您和几内亚共和国政府的领导下，在维护民族独立，发展民族经济和文化事业，清除殖民主义所遗留下的影响等方面，都取得一系列的重大成就和胜利，有力地支持和鼓舞了非洲人民的民族独立运动和全世界人民反对帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的斗争。特别令人欢欣鼓舞的是，中几两国人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中和建设各自祖国的互相合作中所建立起来的深厚友谊，由于您的访华而进入了一个新的历史时期。在和平共处五项原则的基础上，中几两国人民的友好关系必将不断得到新的发展！
    “祝几内亚共和国国家繁荣，人民幸福！”
    “祝中几人民的友谊万古长青！”
