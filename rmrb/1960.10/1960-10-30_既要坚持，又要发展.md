    Both Upholding and Developing

    Rapid production development, annual increases in income; cadres and commune members all feel happy, with ever-increasing enthusiasm – this is the production situation and the mental outlook of the people in the Fengtaiping Management District of the Dayou People's Commune in Wuxiang County, Shanxi.

    Why are they able to achieve this?

    There may be many reasons, but an important one is that they have conscientiously implemented the Party's policies and insisted on implementing the quota management and work-point recording system for six years.

    Chairman Mao taught us in the "Circular on the Situation": "Policy and tactics are the life of the Party." If implemented well, the revolution will succeed; if implemented poorly, the revolution will fail. This is true for conducting class struggle and carrying out people's revolution, and it is also true for conducting production struggle and developing production. The Fengtaiping Management District's adherence to quota management and work-point recording system also means adhering to and implementing the policy of developing production. Therefore, we must not think that because the people's commune has already implemented a distribution system combining wages and supply, there is no need to engage in quota management and work-point recording. If the management districts of people's communes in various regions all adhere to the implementation of policies and the work-point recording system like the Fengtaiping Management District, then the people's communes will surely be able to consolidate and develop rapidly, and agricultural production will be thriving.

    Policies and systems belong to the superstructure, and any superstructure serves the economic base. With a superstructure that adapts to the economic base, the economic base can be consolidated and developed. The Party's resolutions in the past pointed out that rural people's communes are still socialist in nature at this stage. Therefore, its distribution system must adhere to the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." Work-point recording is a good way to embody this principle.

    It is incomplete to regard work-point recording as merely a rational distribution of economic income for commune members; it also has vivid political content. The so-called "work evaluation" is also to evaluate the amount and quality of an individual's contribution to social labor within a certain period of time. In this sense, "work evaluation" is "merit evaluation," that is, evaluating the size of an individual's contribution to socialist construction. Therefore, adhering to the implementation of work-point recording has also become a good way for our farmers to conduct self-labor education and stimulate production enthusiasm.

    Fengtaiping has not only set a very good example in adhering to quota management and work-point recording system, but also has something to learn from in how to adhere to this system. Our advocacy of adhering to quota management and work-point recording system is not to require that it be preserved unchanged like a "family heirloom," but that it should be continuously developed according to the development of things, so that it adapts to the needs of production. This is what Fengtaiping has done. They have not only created various methods of work-point recording, making work evaluation more reasonable and point recording more appropriate, greatly improving the quality and quantity of labor, but also given full play to the role of the work-point recording system in various aspects, promoting labor management and financial management, and establishing a good atmosphere of love for labor, diligence in running the commune, and strict practice of increasing production and practicing economy among the masses and cadres. From this, it can be seen that adhering to quota management and adhering to the implementation of the work-point recording system can improve the commune's business management and better implement the Party's policy of developing production. Every commune should conscientiously implement the Party's various policies and systems like Fengtaiping.

### 既要坚持，又要发展

    既要坚持，又要发展
    生产迅速发展，收入年年增加；干部社员人人心情舒畅，干劲越来越高——这就是山西武乡县大有人民公社凤台坪管理区的生产状况和人们的精神面貌。
    他们为什么能够作到这样呢？
    原因可能很多，重要的一条是他们六年来认真贯彻党的政策，坚持执行了定额管理和评工记分制度。
    毛主席在《关于情况的通报》中教导我们说：“政策和策略是党的生命”。贯彻得好，革命就能胜利；贯彻得不好，革命就会失败。进行阶级斗争，搞人民革命是如此，进行生产斗争，搞发展生产也是如此。凤台坪管理区坚持执行定额管理和评工记分制度，也就坚持贯彻执行了发展生产的政策。所以，不能以为人民公社已经实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，就不必再搞定额管理和评工记分了。如果各地人民公社的各个管理区都像凤台坪管理区一样，坚持贯彻政策，坚持评工记分制度，那末，人民公社一定能够迅速巩固发展，而农业生产也就能够蒸蒸日上了。
    政策，制度都是属于上层建筑的东西，任何上层建筑都是为经济基础服务的。有了适应经济基础的上层建筑，就能使经济基础得到巩固发展。党的历次决议中指出，农村人民公社在现阶段还是社会主义性质的。因此，它的分配制度必须坚持“各尽所能，按劳分配”的原则。评工记分正是体现这一原则的好办法。
    把评工记分看成仅仅是对社员的经济收入进行合理分配是不全面的，它还有生动的政治内容。所谓“评工”，也就是评定一个人在一定时间内对社会劳动贡献的多少、好坏。在这个意义上，“评工”就是“评功”，就是评定一个人对社会主义建设的功劳的大小。因此，坚持执行评工记分，也就成为我国农民进行自我劳动教育和激发生产积极性的一种良好方式。
    凤台坪不只是在坚持定额管理和评工记分制度方面，树立了一个很好的榜样，在怎样坚持这个制度方面，也有值得学习之处。我们主张坚持定额管理和评工记分制度，并不是要求像对待“传家宝”那样，把它原封不动地保存下来，而是应该根据事物的发展，不断地发展它，使它适应生产的需要。凤台坪就是这样作的。他们不但创造了各种评工记分的办法，使工评得更合理，分记得更恰当，大大提高了劳动的质量和数量，并且从各方面发挥评工记分制度的作用，促进了劳动管理和财务管理工作，在群众和干部中树立了热爱劳动、勤俭办社和厉行增产节约的优良风气。由此可见，坚持定额管理，坚持执行评工记分制度，就能搞好公社的经营管理工作，就能更好地贯彻党的发展生产的政策。每个公社都应该像凤台坪一样，认真贯彻执行党的各项政策和制度。
