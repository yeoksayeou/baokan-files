Make Collective Dormitories Centers of Political and Cultural Activities
Rongchang Coal Mine Launches Red Flag Dormitory Movement
Workers Engage in “Seven Goods” Competition to Study Well, Live Well, and Produce Even Better

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to Sichuan Daily news: Rongchang Coal Mine in Sichuan Province is carrying out the "Red Flag Dormitory" movement, transforming collective dormitories into an important front for conducting communist education among workers and a central place for workers to engage in political and cultural activities.
    In adhering to and implementing the "Four Togethers" system, cadres of Rongchang Coal Mine, relying on and assisting the worker masses, have rationally adjusted the workers’ collective dormitories. The method is to adjust the collective dormitories by team and class, based on the wellhead, coking yard, and auxiliary departments. After the adjustment, it has basically been achieved that workers of different shifts do not affect each other’s rest, and cadres live with workers, and the offices of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League of each team are also located in the dormitories, strengthening ideological and political work for the workers and various activities such as group competitions. Then, with "Seven Goods" (firm stance and good ideology; safe production and good completion of tasks; good production and learning attendance; good observance of discipline and rules; good mutual assistance and unity; good technological innovation; good cultural, recreational, sports, and cleanliness) as conditions, the Red Flag Dormitory movement was launched, making the workers’ collective dormitories truly a central place for workers to engage in political and cultural activities and an important front for conducting communist education.
    The Red Flag Dormitory movement was enthusiastically welcomed by the broad masses of workers from the very beginning. All teams and classes actively responded to the call of the Party Committee, immediately carried out discussions under the specific leadership of the Party branches, formulated guarantee measures, and strived to quickly become Red Flag Dormitories. Competitions were also launched between teams and classes, so that the various activities carried out in the workers’ collective dormitories closely coordinated with the current central tasks, promoting production.
    In carrying out the Red Flag Dormitory movement, all teams mobilized the masses to establish study rooms in their spare time, revised the plans for studying Chairman Mao’s works, improved the study groups, and selected political study instructors; the worker masses actively participated in learning, further setting off a new upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works. Combining with the current central tasks, the workers successively studied articles such as "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" and the instructions of the Party Central Committee on launching the increased production and economizing movement centered on grain and steel, and in connection with their ideology and reality, observed things and solved current production problems according to Chairman Mao's teachings, improving their ideological understanding and political consciousness, and carried out work with a spirit of continuous revolution and an attitude of being masters of their own affairs. From September 1st to 20th, the entire mine launched a rationalization proposal activity centered on increasing production and economizing, and the proposals put forward in twenty days increased more than eleven times compared with the entire month of August; at the same time, extensive economizing activities were carried out, and a large amount of waste steel, waste pit wood, raw coal, and coke breeze were picked up and used.
    Because the members of each production team live in the same room or adjacent rooms, the members of the core group not only produce together with the comrades in the group, but also stay with the comrades in the group during rest time, so they are more aware of the ideological situation of the comrades in the group, which is convenient for publicizing the Party's guidelines and policies, leading the masses to implement the Party's instructions, and better helping the comrades in the group to improve their political consciousness. In order to do a good job in regular ideological and political work, each dormitory also cooperates with the mine, wellhead, and workshop amateur Party schools, Youth League schools, Red and Expert schools, clubs, and libraries to conduct propaganda in the form of reports, broadcasts, blackboards, slogans, and entertainment programs, organizing a political work network to deeply root the Party's policies in the hearts of the people.
    In the movement to vigorously develop Red Flag Dormitories, the mine Party committee also relied on the masses to strengthen enterprise management and organize socialist labor competitions. Each team established "three charts" in the dormitory (chart of production task completion, chart of attendance, and chart of economic accounting), and announced daily the production task completion of each group and individual, attendance, and economic accounting of the entire team; organized "three meetings" (production meeting, key meeting, and economic activity analysis meeting) to study production indicators, formulate measures to increase production and economize, comprehensively check and analyze the completion of production tasks, and find the reasons and add measures for the key production tasks to ensure the overfulfillment of production tasks. In late August, the fourth group of the fourth coal mining team of the No. 1 well saw from the economic accounting chart that the group's work efficiency indicators were not completed and the working hours were overspent by twenty-four working days. They immediately convened a production meeting to study and improve the operating methods of drilling and blasting. The group leader, Liang Shaokun, took the lead and fought hard, increasing the amount of coal falling per shot from less than one ton to more than 1.3 tons, overfulfilling the task every day, and saving four working days by the end of the month. Now, workers can often be seen in the workers' dormitories studying the mining methods of the working face and discussing how to exercise the power of enterprise management delegated to the well.
    After the Red Flag Dormitory movement was launched, it also vigorously promoted the patriotic health movement. In the "Seven Goods" competition based on dormitories as units, everyone in the entire mine took action to remove weeds, fill in sewage pits, and dredge open and closed ditches, and the environmental sanitation was greatly improved. The sanitation work in the dormitories has also been further strengthened and has become regular and systematic. Each dormitory also established and improved propagandists, life attendants, health inspectors, public security guards, political study instructors, and cultural teachers, and each room also selected a room leader. Under the leadership of the Party branch, taking advantage of the convenience of concentrated residence of various production units, cultural learning, recreational sports, and other activities were widely carried out, and public security work was strengthened. If there are patients in the dormitory, cadres, life attendants, and comrades in the same room will enthusiastically help; when family members of workers come to the mine to visit relatives, everyone will also help with reception and accommodation, and the workers are united, help each other, and their feelings are more intimate.

    使集体宿舍成为政治文化活动的中心场所
    荣昌煤矿开展红旗宿舍运动
    职工投入“七好”竞赛学习好、生活好、生产的更好
    本报讯　据四川日报消息：四川省荣昌煤矿开展“红旗宿舍”运动，把集体宿舍变成对职工进行共产主义教育的一个重要阵地，成为职工进行政治文化活动的中心场所。
    荣昌煤矿的干部在坚持贯彻“四同”制度中，依靠和帮助职工群众，对职工集体宿舍进行了合理调整。办法是以井口、焦场和辅助部门的队、班为单位，调整集体宿舍。调整后，基本上做到了各班次工人互不影响休息，并且干部与工人住在一起，各队党、政、工、团的办公室也设在宿舍，加强了对工人的思想政治工作和小组竞赛等各种活动。接着又以“七好”（立场坚定思想好，生产安全完成任务好，生产、学习出勤好，遵守纪律制度好，互助团结协作好，技术革新好，文娱体育、清洁卫生好）为条件，开展了红旗宿舍运动，使职工集体宿舍真正成为职工进行政治、文化活动的中心场所，成为进行共产主义教育的一个重要阵地。
    红旗宿舍运动一开始，就受到广大职工的热烈欢迎。各队、班都积极响应党委的号召，在党支部的具体领导下，立即进行讨论，制订出保证措施，争取迅速成为红旗宿舍。各队、班之间还开展了竞赛，使职工集体宿舍中开展的各项活动，密切配合当前中心工作，推动了生产。
    在开展红旗宿舍运动中，各队都发动群众，利用业余时间建立了学习室，并修订了学习毛主席著作的规划，健全了学习小组，选出了政治学习辅导员；职工群众都积极参加学习，进一步掀起了学习毛主席著作的热潮。职工们结合当前的中心工作，先后学习了“矛盾论”、“实践论”等文章和党中央关于开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的指示，并联系思想、联系实际，根据毛主席的教导来观察事物，解决当前生产中的问题，提高自己的思想认识和政治觉悟，以不断革命的精神和主人翁的劳动态度来进行工作。9月1日至20日，全矿职工开展了以增产节约为中心的提合理化建议活动，二十天提出的建议比8月全月增加了十一倍多；同时广泛开展节约活动，拣用了大量的废钢铁、废坑木、原煤和焦子。
    由于各生产小组的人员住在一个房间或紧邻的几个房间里，核心小组的成员除与组内同志一起生产外，休息时间也与组内同志在一起，因而更了解组内同志的思想情况，便于宣传党的方针、政策，带领群众贯彻党的指示，更好地帮助组内同志提高政治觉悟。为了作好经常的思想政治工作，各宿舍还配合矿、井口、车间的业余党校、团校、红专学校、俱乐部、图书室，利用报告、广播、黑板报、标语、文娱节目等形式进行宣传，组织了一个政治工作网，使党的政策深入人心。
    在大搞红旗宿舍的运动中，矿党委还依靠群众，加强企业管理和组织社会主义劳动竞赛。各队在宿舍建立了“三表”（生产任务完成情况表、出勤情况表和经济核算表），按日公布各组和个人的生产任务完成情况，出勤情况和全队的经济核算情况；组织“三会”（生产会、关键会和经济活动分析会），研究生产指标，制订增产节约措施，全面检查分析生产任务完成情况，并针对生产关键找原因、添措施，保证生产任务超额完成。8月下旬，一井采煤四队第四组从经济核算表中，看到本组工效指标未完成，工时超支二十四个工作日，马上召开了生产会，研究出改进打眼放炮的操作方法，组长梁绍昆带头奋战，使每炮落煤从不到一吨提高到一点三吨以上，天天超额完成任务，到月底还节余了四个工作日。现在，职工宿舍里经常可以看到工人们在研究工作面开采方法，商量如何行使好下放到井下的企业管理权力。
    红旗宿舍运动开展后，还有力地推动了爱国卫生运动。在以宿舍为单位的“七好”竞赛中，全矿人人动手清除杂草，填平污水坑，疏通阴沟、阳沟，环境卫生大大改观。宿舍里也进一步加强了卫生工作，并做到了经常化、制度化。各宿舍还建立和健全了宣传员、生活员、卫生检查员、治安保卫员、政治学习辅导员、文化教员，每间寝室还选出室长。在党支部的领导下，利用各生产单位集中居住的方便，广泛开展了文化学习、文娱体育等活动，并加强了治安保卫工作。宿舍中有了病号，干部、生活员和同寝室的同志都热情帮助；职工家属来矿探亲时，大家也帮助接待和办理食、宿，工人们团结互助，感情更加亲密。
