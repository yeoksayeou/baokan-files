Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. General Ne Win, Chief of Staff of the Burmese Armed Forces, accompanied by General Lo Jui-ching, Chief of Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, visited the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition this morning.

	General Ne Win spent more than an hour viewing the achievements of the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement by Chinese workers in the machinery, light industry, and textile industry pavilions. In the machinery pavilion, after seeing various light and improved farm tools, General Ne Win praised, saying that with these machines, a lot of manpower can be saved. When he saw the rice transplanter, he said to the people accompanying him, "This is very good. Burma is now also using this type of transplanter." General Ne Win was very interested in the development of small paper mills in various parts of China. He inquired in detail about the production process and machinery of the small paper mills and viewed the products of these factories. The guide told General Ne Win that these clean white sheets of paper were made from rice straw. General Ne Win said that Burma could also build small paper mills like this. Burma has a lot of rice straw, and when farmers harvest, they only cut the ears of rice, and the rice straw is not fully utilized. Subsequently, General Ne Win also viewed various brightly colored textiles.

	This morning, General Ne Win's wife, accompanied by Zhang Qian, wife of Vice Premier Chen Yi, toured the Palace Museum. The distinguished guests of the Burmese government delegation visited the Great Wall and the Underground Palace.

    奈温将军参观工业交通展览会
    新华社2日讯　缅甸国防军总参谋长奈温将军今天上午由中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿大将陪同参观了全国工业交通展览会。
    奈温将军用一个多小时的时间，先后在机械馆、轻工业馆和纺织工业馆观看了我国工人群众大闹技术革新和技术革命运动的成果。在机械馆，奈温将军看到各种轻巧的改良农具后，称赞说，有了这些机械可以节省很多人力。当他看到水稻插秧机的时候，对陪同的人们说，这个很好，缅甸现在也使用了这种插秧机。奈温将军对我国各地小型造纸工厂的发展十分有兴趣。他详细地询问了小型纸厂的生产过程和机械设备，并且观看了这些工厂的产品。讲解员告诉奈温将军，这些洁白的纸张是用稻草做原料制成的。奈温将军说，像这样的小纸厂，缅甸也可以建设。缅甸有很多稻草，农民收割的时候，只割了稻穗，稻草没有充分利用。随后，奈温将军又观看了各种花色鲜艳的纺织品。
    今天上午，奈温将军夫人由陈毅副总理夫人张茜陪同，游览了故宫。缅甸政府代表团的贵宾们游览了长城和地下宫殿。
