Guangxi Vigorously Grasps Late Rice Field Management
    In Guangxi, the late rice seedlings are generally in the gestation and heading stage, and now is the final and decisive moment to strive for greater late rice production. Therefore, all localities, in the spirit of managing to the end and finishing well, are seizing the last opportunity to comprehensively adopt the "three attacks" and "five preventions" measures, namely, attacking the three types of seedlings, attacking the gestation fertilizer, attacking the ear and grain fertilizer, and preventing drought, preventing cold dew and wind, preventing lodging, preventing birds and animals, and preventing diseases and insect pests. After fully completing the late rice gestation fertilization, the Dajin People's Commune in Pingnan County once again organized cadres and members to identify seedlings in the fields plot by plot, and further adopted new management measures according to the growth of seedlings in various fields: for the seedlings that have just emerged ears, additional grain fertilizer is applied, and special personnel are assigned to watch the water, and shallow irrigation and moist irrigation are done well to prevent lodging; for the seedlings that are in the gestation and pregnancy stage, multiple fertilizations are used to promote rapid heading of the seedlings.

Hebei Actively Plants Walnut Trees
    Various parts of Hebei are actively developing woody oil crops, and 10 million new walnut trees have been planted this year.
    Hebei Province is one of the main producing areas of woody oil in the country. Walnut trees are distributed throughout the province, from the Taihang Mountains in the south to the Yanshan Mountains in the north. After liberation, walnut production developed rapidly. According to statistics at the end of 1959, the number of walnut trees in the province had increased to 67.2 million, an increase of 8.5 times compared with before liberation. All localities have planned areas not suitable for agricultural development, such as mountains, valleys, foothills, and gentle slopes, as woody oil bases mainly for walnuts, with a total area of 8.5 million mu.

Hunan Actively Prepares for Oil-Tea Seed Harvesting
    As the oil-tea seed harvesting season approaches in Hunan, people's communes in various oil-tea producing areas throughout the province are actively carrying out various harvesting preparations. Qidong County, while ensuring that the three autumn tasks are done well, has organized 250,000 laborers and prepared a large number of bamboo baskets, back baskets, and more than 600 various vehicles. Hengshan, Yongxing, Taoyuan, Liuyang, Huaihua and other counties have also successively held special oil-tea meetings to make specific arrangements for oil-tea harvesting work.

Sichuan Cotton Farmers Peel Cotton Stalks
    Sichuan Province is actively organizing cotton farmers to peel cotton stalks to increase more raw materials for light industry.
    The masses in the cotton producing areas of Sichuan Province have the habit of peeling and utilizing cotton stalks. The broad masses widely use cotton stalk fiber (made after degumming cotton stalks) to process and manufacture packaging or industrial cloth, sacks, ropes and other products, which saves a lot of raw cotton and increases income for the communes. This year, various parts of Sichuan made preparations for the production of cotton stalk bark early, and proposed to "pull one, peel one, peel while pulling, and peel clean after pulling." At present, the province has uniformly arranged 5,000 high-efficiency peeling machines that can peel cotton stalks on 15 mu of land per day; various major cotton producing areas have also designed and manufactured various hand-cranked and foot-operated light peeling machines.

By the 12th, the autumn vegetables harvested accounted for 67 percent of the area that should be harvested.
    In the rush harvest of autumn vegetables, all communes ensure that no leaves are lost and that all vegetables are returned to the cellar. The Daoli People's Commune organized three teams for pulling vegetables, stacking, and picking vegetables, achieving pulling and picking at the same time. The communes adopted the method of harvesting vegetables on the one hand and transporting them on the other, and transported the harvested vegetables back in time.
