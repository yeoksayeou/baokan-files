Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from Elisabethville: The people of Katanga Province, Congo, have taken up arms to resist the rule of the imperialist running dog, the Tshombe traitorous clique. According to a spokesman for this clique's "Ministry of the Interior" on the 4th, the city of Niunzu, 120 kilometers west of Albertville in Katanga Province, was recently attacked by more than 300 armed people. The Tshombe reactionary authorities there have been forced to flee in panic to Albertville.

The spokesman also revealed that near Noanba, 90 kilometers from Albertville, patriotic people attacked the railway lines controlled by the Tshombe clique and detained a freight train. According to reports, under the blows of the people's armed forces, the followers of the Tshombe clique are scrambling to escape.

However, a UN spokesman in Katanga Province clamored that the "UN forces" stationed in Albertville are ready to fight against the patriotic struggle of the people of Katanga Province.

Other news says that in Elisabethville, the nest of the Tshombe clique, the heroic struggle of the local people against the traitors is also in progress. In a state of panic, the Tshombe clique declared an indefinite curfew there on the 4th. Paratrooper-uniformed gendarmes and helmeted reactionary police are constantly patrolling the streets.

For the past two months or more, the people of Katanga Province have launched a vigorous struggle throughout almost the entire province against the Tshombe traitorous clique fostered by imperialism, and to defend the independence and unity of the Congo. In Manono, Luena in the central part of the province, and Malamba-Nkula in the north, local people have organized their own armed forces and fought with the Tshombe reactionary military police, severely striking at the clique's reactionary rule in Katanga Province. With the support of the "UN forces" manipulated by the United States and massive military assistance from Belgian colonialists, the Tshombe clique has carried out a frenzied suppression of the patriotic people, massacring large numbers of them. According to Western news agencies, this traitorous clique massacred 70 insurgents in Manono on September 13 alone; and on September 15, it killed 68 patriots in Luena.

Reports say that despite the bloody suppression by the Tshombe clique, the patriotic struggle of the people of Katanga Province is flourishing, and the situation there is extremely tense.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 5th: The National Assembly of the United Arab Republic passed a resolution at yesterday's meeting supporting the UAR government's attitude on the Congo issue, condemning the imperialist conspiracy in the Congo, and demanding the establishment of an international neutral committee to investigate the mistakes made by the United Nations.

Deputy Foreign Minister Sabri said in a speech to the parliament that "Imperialism knew from the beginning that Lumumba's existence was a threat to their interests. But despite the various conspiracies of the imperialists, Lumumba still won a majority of votes in the elections and obtained more than 96% of the votes in some areas."

Referring to the UN's aggression against the Congo, Sabri said that the UAR troops "refused to be used as tools to commit such errors."

    冲伯集团在“联合国军”支持下屠杀爱国者
    阿联议会要求调查联合国在刚果所犯的错误
    新华社5日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：刚果加丹加省人民纷纷拿起武器反抗帝国主义走狗、冲伯卖国集团的统治。据这个集团的“内政部”发言人4日透露，加丹加省阿尔伯特维尔以西一百二十公里的尼恩祖市，最近遭到了三百多名武装人民的袭击。那里的冲伯反动当局已被迫慌张地逃到阿尔伯特维尔。
    这个发言人还透露，在距离阿尔伯特维尔九十公里的诺昂巴附近，爱国人民袭击了冲伯集团控制下的铁路交通线，并且扣留了一列货车。消息说，在人民武装力量的打击下，冲伯集团的追随者都争相逃命。
    但是，加丹加省的一个联合国发言人竟叫嚣说，驻在阿尔伯特维尔的“联合国军”已准备战斗来对付加丹加省人民的爱国斗争。
    另有消息说，在冲伯集团的巢穴伊利沙伯维尔，当地人民反对卖国贼的英勇斗争也在进展中。惊惶失措的冲伯集团4日已在那里宣布无限期戒严。穿着伞兵服装的宪兵和头带钢盔的反动警察不停地在街道上巡逻。
    最近两个多月来，加丹加省人民几乎在这个省的全境展开了轰轰烈烈的反对由帝国主义扶植的冲伯卖国集团、卫护刚果独立和统一的斗争。在这个省中部的马诺诺、卢埃纳和北部的马朗巴—恩库拉等地，当地人民组织了自己的武装力量，并同冲伯反动军警进行搏斗，狠狠地打击了这个集团在加丹加省的反动统治。在美国操纵的“联合国军”的支持和比利时殖民者的大量军事援助下，冲伯集团竟向爱国人民进行了疯狂的镇压，屠杀了大批爱国人民。仅据西方通讯社透露，这个卖国集团9月13日一天就在马诺诺屠杀了七十名起义人民；9月15日又在卢埃纳杀害了六十八名爱国者。
   消息说，尽管冲伯集团进行了血腥的镇压，但是加丹加省人民的爱国斗争正方兴未艾，那里的情况极为紧张。
    新华社开罗5日电　阿拉伯联合共和国国民议会在昨天举行的会议上通过决议，支持阿联政府对刚果问题的态度，谴责帝国主义在刚果所制造的阴谋，并要求成立国际中立委员会调查联合国所犯的错误。
    外交部副部长萨布里在议会上讲话时说，“帝国主义从一开始就知道，卢蒙巴的存在是对它们利益的威胁。可是尽管帝国主义者施展各种阴谋，卢蒙巴在选举中仍获得了多数票，并在一些地区获得96％以上的选票”。
    萨布里在谈到联合国对刚果的侵犯时说，阿联的部队“拒绝被人利用充当犯这类错误的工具”。
