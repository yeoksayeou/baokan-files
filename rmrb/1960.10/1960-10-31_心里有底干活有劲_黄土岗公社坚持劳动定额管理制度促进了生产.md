Having a Clear Understanding Boosts Enthusiasm
    ——Huangtugang Commune Persists in Implementing Labor Quota Management System to Promote Production
    Jin Lan Cheng Lin

The Pendong Production Team of the Huangtugang People's Commune in Fengtai District, Beijing, has implemented a quota management system, improved labor management, and ensured continuous growth in production and income. The commune's Party committee has used this team as a model, launching a "Learn from Pendong Team, Catch up with Pendong Team" production competition throughout the commune, which has powerfully promoted the development of production.

Since the establishment of the People's Commune, the Pendong Team has consistently implemented a quota management system, gradually achieving a state where every type of farm work has a quota, everyone works according to the quota, labor quotas are reasonable, and labor compensation is fair. This has fully motivated the commune members, enabling the entire team to maintain a labor enthusiasm characterized by "no need to look for people for work, no waiting around in the fields, no long breaks at the fields, and striving for the best." This has ensured the continuous leap forward in production. The team's total income in 1958 increased by 12.8% compared to 1957, and in 1959, despite suffering severe rain and flood disasters, income still increased by 33% compared to 1958. This year, although facing another severe drought, the harvested agricultural products have all exceeded planned targets. By the end of September, the team had already completed 68.4% of its annual contracted production tasks. Currently, the team's nine hundred and sixty mu of autumn vegetables have sufficient water and fertilizer, and the seedlings are strong.

Over the past few years, the main experiences of the Pendong Production Team in implementing the quota management system and strengthening labor management are:

    Formulate Quotas, Inspect Segment by Segment, Implement to the Groups

Comprehensive and reasonable formulation of labor quotas is a prerequisite for the smooth implementation of the quota management system. Every year before spring plowing, the Pendong Team examines the implementation of the previous year's labor quotas item by item, proposes specific plans for revising quotas, and submits them to commune members for full discussion and suggestions. The team committee then revises and finalizes the labor quotas for all agricultural tasks for the entire year at once, based on the opinions of the masses. These quotas are then printed into a labor quota manual and distributed to each production group. Without a notification from the team committee to modify the labor quotas, the groups are not allowed to change the quotas at will. When comprehensively revising the quotas, the team mainly focuses on two things: First, try to determine reasonable work points for each farm task according to the amount of labor required, the level of skill, and the difficulty of operation; second, strive to make the labor quotas for similar farm tasks before and after, and on the left and right, generally balanced. Due to the continuous adoption of methods that broadly mobilize the masses to formulate and revise labor quotas over the past few years, the team now has a complete set of labor quotas. All five hundred and twenty types of crops and four hundred-plus farm tasks have quotas, and these quotas are generally fair and reasonable, satisfying the commune members.

The natural conditions of agricultural production are changeable; therefore, labor quotas formulated according to general normal conditions often prove not entirely reasonable. When arranging the farm work for the next stage every seven or eight days, the Pendong Production Team reviews all the labor quotas and promptly revises them if there are significant changes in natural conditions, and implements the quotas to the groups. For example, the initial quota for peanut sowing was 10.3 work points per mu. This year, peanut sowing coincided with a drought and dry land, with seventy out of one hundred mu requiring drought resistance by carrying water for sowing. The team committee revised the labor quotas for carrying water for peanut sowing to 85, 90, 95, and 105 points per mu, respectively, based on conditions such as the distance of each plot from the water source.

The advantages of adopting this method of mobilizing the masses to set annual quotas at once and then reviewing and revising them segment by segment are: First, cadres master the quotas and work proactively; second, commune members have a clear understanding of the labor quotas for the entire year and each stage, boosting their enthusiasm; and third, it facilitates mutual support and adaptation to changes in natural conditions, making the quotas more reasonable.

    Fixed Plots, Flexible Task Assignment, Balanced Work Points

The Pendong Production Team divides its two hundred and several dozen laborers into six production groups according to their places of residence and labor strength, and correspondingly equips them with leadership cadres and technical personnel. Each group has fixed responsible plots, and the group leader is responsible for daily task assignment. The implementation of this responsibility system of fixing plots to the groups can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the group leaders, rationally use every laborer, avoid idling, facilitate the development of production competitions within the team, strengthen the collective sense of responsibility of the groups, and effectively ensure the quality of farm work. In July of this year, the fourteen and a half mu of Chinese cabbage of the Fifth Production Group had uneven seedling emergence due to rain after sowing and poor sowing quality. Many commune members advocated for replanting. After approval from the team, this plot was replanted with Chinese cabbage. Now the cabbage is growing uniformly and is the best plot of Chinese cabbage in the entire team.

Ensuring that the work points between groups are generally balanced is one of the important conditions for the smooth implementation of the quota management system and the rational distribution of commune members' income. Under the condition that the Pendong Production Team implements large-scale continuous planting of various crops, the types of farm work and production tasks of each group are still different. They have solved the problem of unbalanced labor work points between groups by adopting a method that combines fixed responsible plots with flexible allocation of farm work. On the one hand, when arranging each stage of farm work, the team must measure the production tasks of each group to try to make them generally equal; on the other hand, when the groups summarize and submit their labor report forms each month, the team must check item by item whether each group has conscientiously implemented the labor quotas and calculate whether the labor work points of each group are generally balanced according to the number of laborers in attendance. Once a significant disparity is discovered, measures are promptly taken to adjust farm work to solve it. For example, at the beginning of June this year, the First Production Group had to rush to plant twenty-five mu of summer vegetables and rush to harvest cabbage, making the tasks relatively large, while the production tasks of the Sixth Production Group were relatively small. When the team cadres balanced the production tasks and work points of each group, they promptly discovered this problem and immediately transferred the task of rushing to harvest and market ten mu of cabbage from the First Group to the Sixth Group, which ensured the timely completion of production tasks and balanced the labor work points between groups, achieving both goals with one move.

    Calculate Work Daily, Announce Monthly

Work points directly reflect the labor income of commune members. Therefore, commune members are very concerned about calculating work, registering labor manuals, and announcing work point accounts. Because the Pendong Team does this work in a timely manner, every commune member is clear about their labor, which promotes commune members' enthusiasm for attendance and active labor. In July of this year, female commune member Liu Jinrong of the Sixth Group took a break from work for four or five days due to personal matters. When the team announced the work point accounts at the end of the month, she saw that female commune member Su Xuezhen, who often competed with her, had not rested a single day and had earned more than thirty work points than her. She immediately said, "In August, I will definitely have full attendance and catch up with Su Xuezhen!" As a result, both Liu Jinrong and Su Xuezhen had full attendance in August. Such attendance competitions, in which people are named on the work point list to encourage each other, occur almost every month and in every group. For the past two years, the Pendong Production Team has consistently implemented a system of "calculating work daily according to completion, registering in manuals segment by segment, and announcing work points monthly." In order to avoid the trouble of assigning work to people daily by the groups, the team generally contracts work that can be completed in two or three days or three to five days to several people according to the quota, implementing collective contracting. This makes it inconvenient to clear work and record accounts daily. Therefore, the recorders have created a method of calculating completion daily and registering in manuals segment by segment—that is, the work contracted by several people is calculated as ten shares of work. The number of shares completed by each person each day is recorded, and after the entire contracted work is completed, the shares are converted into work points according to the quota table and recorded in each person's labor manual. At the beginning of each month, each group must report the labor report form of the commune members and the work points earned by each person to the production team, and the team registers work point accounts for each commune member and posts a public announcement.

Because the work recording is clear, the procedures are complete, and the announcements are timely, there have been no errors in the work point accounts this year.

    Strengthen Political Work, Ensure System Implementation

To persist in implementing the quota management system, it is necessary to put politics in command and let ideology lead the way. First, it is necessary to solve the ideological problems of team and group cadres. When the Pendong Team first implemented the quota management system, some groups failed to implement it because a few cadres found it troublesome. At that time, it was autumn, and the team's stipulated labor quota for weeding radishes was 9.5 work points per mu. Some commune members of the Third Group did not meet the quota after working for a day and complained that "the quota is too high!" The production group leader at the time echoed, "It's really troublesome to do this. If the quota is too high or too low, you can't find fairness. It's either you get too much or he gets too little, and you have to calculate the accounts for half the night after work. Let's just forget it." In this way, this group returned to the old path and continued to implement the "Maozi work" of calculating work by the day. After the Party branch discovered this problem, it organized a quota management committee to verify the labor quotas, and criticized the cadres' fear of trouble. This group then re-implemented the labor quota system.

After implementing quota management, the important issue is to educate a few commune members not to be picky and to value quality. The Pendong Team adopted the methods of giving positive reasoning and inserting red flags to solve this problem. At every commune member meeting where work is arranged and summarized, the production team commends model commune members who actively work, do not pick work, and do not compete for points, and conducts collective education on the collectivist ideology of diligent production and loving the commune like home. The practical actions of all Party members, Communist Youth League members, and cadres of the Pendong Team in "striving to do hard work and being models of quality" have also effectively influenced and motivated all commune members to work actively.

    心里有底干活有劲
    ——黄土岗公社坚持劳动定额管理制度促进了生产
    金岚　成林
    北京丰台区黄土岗人民公社盆东生产队，推行定额管理制度，搞好劳动管理，保证了生产、收入连年增长。公社党委以这个队作为标兵，在全公社开展了一个“学盆东队，赶盆东队”的生产竞赛运动，有力地促进了生产的发展。
    人民公社建立以来，盆东队一直坚持执行了定额管理制度，而且逐步做到了样样农活有定额，人人干活按定额，劳动定额合理，劳动报酬公平，因此充分发挥了社员的积极性，使全队社员始终保持着“出工不用找，下地不候齐，地头没大歇，干活争头份”的劳动热情，保证了生产的连年跃进。全队1958年总收入比1957年增加了12.8％，1959年在遭受严重雨涝灾害的情况下，收入仍然比1958年增加33％。今年虽然又遇到了严重的干旱，可是已经收获的农产品，样样超额完成计划，到9月底，全队已经完成全年包产任务的68.4％。目前，全队九百六十亩秋菜，水足肥丰秧棵壮。
    几年来，盆东生产队执行定额管理制度，加强劳动管理的主要经验是：
    制订定额　逐段检查　落实到组
    全面合理地制订劳动定额，是顺利推行定额管理制度的先决条件。每年春耕以前，盆东队根据上一年劳动定额的执行情况，逐项地检查和提出修订定额的具体方案，交社员充分讨论，提出意见；再由队委会根据群众的意见，把全年各项农活的劳动定额一次修订、定案，并油印成劳动定额手册，发给每个生产小组。没有队委会修改劳动定额的通知单，小组不得随意更改定额。在全面修订定额的时候，主要注意两件事：一是尽量使每项农活都按其所需要的劳动量大小、技术高低和操作难易确定合理的工分；一是力求使前后左右同类农活的劳动定额大体平衡。由于几年来不断地采取广泛发动群众制订、修订劳动定额的方法，现在这个队已经有了一整套劳动定额。全队五十二种农作物的四百多项活茬，样样有定额，并且做到了大体公平合理，社员满意。
    农业生产的自然条件是多变的，因此按照一般正常条件制订的劳动定额，常常会发生不尽合理的现象。盆东生产队在每隔七八天安排下一个阶段农活的时候，就将全部农活的劳动定额审查一遍，遇有较大的自然条件变化，就及时修改定额，并把定额落实到组。例如，年初制订的花生播种定额是每亩十点三个工分，今年花生播种时正赶上天旱地干，一百亩中有七十亩需要抗旱挑水播种，队委会就根据每块地离水源远近等条件，把挑水点种花生的劳动定额分别修订为八十五分、九十分、九十五分、一百零五分一亩。
    采取这种发动群众把全年定额一次定下来，然后逐段审查、修订的办法，有以下几点好处：一是干部掌握定额，工作主动；二是社员对全年和每一阶段的劳动定额心里有底，干活有劲；三是便于前后左右互相照应和适应自然条件的变化，把定额订得更合理些。
    固定地段　灵活派活　平衡工分
    盆东生产队把二百几十个劳动力，按照居住地点、劳力强弱，划分了六个生产小组，相应地配备了领导骨干和技术力量，每个组都有固定的责任地段，日常的派工派活都由组长负责。实行这种小组固定地段的责任制度，能够充分发挥小组长的积极性，合理地使用每一个劳动力，避免窝工，便于开展队内的生产竞赛；加强了小组的集体责任感，有效地保证了农活质量。今年7月份，第五生产组的十四亩半盖菜，因为播种以后遇上了雨和播种质量不太好，出苗不齐，许多社员主张改种，经过队里批准，把这块地改种了大白菜。现在白菜长得刷齐，是全队最好的一块大白菜地。
    保证组与组之间的工分大体平衡，是顺利推行定额管理制度，合理分配社员收入的重要条件之一。盆东生产队在各种作物实行大面积连片种植的条件下，各个小组的农活种类、生产任务仍然不同。他们采取固定责任地段与灵活调配农活相结合的办法，解决了各组之间劳动工分不平衡的问题。他们一方面在安排每一段农活时，队里都要衡量一下各个小组的生产任务，尽量做到大体相等；另一方面在每月小组汇总上报劳动报表单时，队里要逐项地检查各组是否认真执行了劳动定额，并且按出勤的劳动人数，计算一下各组的劳动工分是否大体平衡，一旦发现相差悬殊的现象，就及时采取调整农活的办法加以解决。例如今年6月初，第一生产组既要抢栽二十五亩夏菜，又要抢收洋白菜，任务较大，而第六生产组生产任务却比较小，队干部在平衡各组生产任务和工分的时候，及时发现了这个问题，立即把第一组十亩洋白菜的抢收上市任务拨给了第六组，既保证了按时完成生产任务，又平衡了组与组之间的劳动工分，做到了一举两得。
    天天计工　月月公布
    工分直接体现着社员的劳动收入。所以，社员们对计工、登记劳动手册、公布工分账都十分关心。盆东队由于这些工作做得及时，就使得每个社员对自己的劳动心中有数，促使社员踊跃出勤、积极劳动。今年7月，六组女社员刘近荣因事歇了四五天工。月底队里公布工分账的时候，她看见经常和自己比着劲儿干活的女社员苏学珍一天工没歇，比自己多得三十多个工分，当场就表示：“8月份我一定出全勤，赶上苏学珍！”结果，刘近荣和苏学珍两个人8月份都出了全勤。像这样在工分榜前提名道姓地开展你追我赶的出勤竞赛，几乎月月、组组都有。近两年来，盆东生产队一直坚持执行了“天天按成计工，逐段登记手册，月月公布工分”的制度。为了避免小组天天按人派工派活的麻烦，这个队一般是把两三天或三五天才能干完的活按定额包给几个人，实行集体包工。这样就不便于天天清工记账，于是记工员们就创造了一种按天计成、逐段登记手册的办法——就是把几个人包的活算作十成活，每天按每个人干活多少记下成数，整个包工活干完以后，再按照定额表把成数折算成工分数，登记在每个人的劳动手册上。每月月初，各组都要把上个月社员的劳动报告单和每人所得工分数报到生产队，队里一方面给每个社员登记工分账，一方面张榜公布。
    由于记工清楚，手续齐全，公布及时，今年以来没有差过工分账。
    加强政治工作　保证制度执行
    要坚持推行定额管理制度，必须政治挂帅，思想先行。首先，要解决队、组干部的思想问题。盆东队在刚开始实行定额管理制度的时候，曾经因为少数干部嫌麻烦，有的组就推行不开。当时正值秋天，队里规定的薅萝卜的劳动定额是每一亩九分半，三组的一些社员干了一天没有达到定额，就吵嚷“定额太高了！”当时的生产组长也随声附和地说：“搞这玩艺真麻烦，定额高了低了找不平，不是你多就是他少，干完活还得算半宿账，干脆算了。”就这样，这个组又走了回头路，继续实行了按天计工的“卯子工”。党支部发现这个问题之后，一方面组织了一个定额管理委员会来核定劳动定额，一方面批评了干部怕麻烦的思想，这个组又重新推行劳动定额制度。
    实行定额管理以后，重要问题是教育少数社员不要挑肥拣瘦，重视质量。盆东队采取了正面讲道理、插红旗的办法解决这个问题。生产队在每一次布置、总结工作的社员大会上，都要表扬积极劳动、不挑活、不争分的模范社员，向社员进行勤劳生产、爱社如家的集体主义思想教育。盆东队的全体党员、团员、干部“苦活争着干，质量当模范”的实际行动，也有效地影响和带动了全体社员积极劳动。
