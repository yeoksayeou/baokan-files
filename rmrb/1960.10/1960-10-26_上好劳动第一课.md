    Ace the First Lesson of Labor
    Tian Yong'an

    Young student Qiao Jiguang, after finishing his junior high school studies, went to the forefront of agricultural production and began his first lesson of labor.

    For every young person aspiring to engage in agricultural labor, the first lesson of labor is a compulsory course. If the first lesson is well-learned, it will lay a good foundation, gradually develop affection for agricultural production, and be determined to take root in the countryside and bear fruit.

    To ace the first lesson of labor, one must first have a relatively correct understanding of engaging in agricultural production, like Qiao Jiguang. The purpose of studying is to master cultural and scientific knowledge to better engage in socialist labor. Whether one graduates from elementary school, middle school, or university, one will eventually end school life and go to a post in the construction of the motherland. Our country is a large agricultural country, and the development of the national economy is based on agriculture. Therefore, after graduating from school, young students must serve agriculture directly or indirectly through their work, and most of them must engage in agricultural labor. Of course, taking a labor class is different from taking a class at school. Taking a labor class is not like studying in a classroom at school, where one sits in a classroom, sheltered from the wind and rain, and inevitably has to fight against natural disasters such as wind and rain. In the classroom of the people's commune, what you deal with regularly are no longer just books and pens, but hoes and plows. It is natural to feel unaccustomed to these changes in life at first. Moreover, engaging in agricultural labor is still relatively heavy physical labor, and at the beginning, there will always be some feelings of backache. As long as you have a relatively correct understanding of these difficulties in advance and have a certain ideological preparation, you will gradually get used to them, and in actual practice, you will enhance your courage to overcome difficulties and master nature. Qiao Jiguang's deeds as a farmer illustrate these principles. Isn't that right? You see, when Qiao Jiguang first returned to the countryside, he also felt unaccustomed to the new life; but he listened to the Party, was ambitious, and finally overcame various difficulties, and gradually became accustomed to rural life. In thirty days, he did forty workdays, and his ideological understanding also improved. Therefore, he was praised by the people: "Look at Qiao Jiguang, he can write and calculate when he picks up a pen, and he is full of energy when he goes to the ground!"

    To ace the first lesson of labor is not only a matter for the young students themselves, but also a matter for the "teachers." The Party advocates that school teachers, student parents, and others should act as "voluntary teachers," and the Party and Youth League grassroots organizations in rural areas should serve as "main lecturers." They can use individual talks, organized visits, and seminars to introduce students to the changes in their hometowns and the prospects for construction, so that they can love the countryside more and enhance their confidence in building their homes. Veteran commune members also need to give "technical lessons" to young intellectuals who are newly participating in agricultural production, helping them to quickly learn production skills and gradually develop affection for agricultural labor. In production and life, they should also be given some care as much as possible, such as arranging farm work from light to heavy, from simple to complex, and giving them a certain amount of time for learning. Qiao Jiguang's rushing to the countryside and happily starting his first lesson of labor is the result of the education of the Party and Youth League organizations.

    With the development of the situation, more young intellectuals will go to the forefront of agricultural production. They will, like Qiao Jiguang, have to undergo the training of the first lesson of labor. Every young intellectual who is determined to go to the countryside must be determined to ace the first lesson; the Party and Youth League grassroots organizations in rural areas must help them ace the first lesson. Qiao Jiguang said it well: "The countryside is a vast world, like a large swimming pool, if you have the ability, use all your strength to swim, and you are not afraid of not creating new records!" Then, let us, like Qiao Jiguang, in the rural "big swimming pool," have an "eight immortals crossing the sea, each showing their abilities!"

    上好劳动第一课
    田永安
    青年学生乔继光，在结束初中学业之后，走上了农业生产第一线，开始了劳动第一课。
    对于每一个有志从事农业劳动的青年来说，劳动第一课是必修的课程。第一课上好了，就会打下良好的基础，就会逐步对农业生产发生感情，立志在农村扎下根来，并开花结果。
    要上好劳动第一课，首先要像乔继光那样，对从事农业生产有一个比较正确的认识。读书的目的，在于掌握文化科学知识，更好地从事社会主义劳动。不管是小学毕业，中学毕业，或者是大学毕业，迟早总要结束学校生活，走上祖国建设岗位。我国是一个农业大国，国民经济的发展是以农业为基础的。因此，青年学生从学校毕业后，都要通过自己的工作，直接间接地为农业服务，其中多数还要从事农业劳动。当然，上劳动课和在学校上课不同。上劳动课不像在学校读书那样，坐在教室里，风吹不着，雨打不着，免不了要和风雨等自然灾害搏斗。在人民公社的课堂里，和你经常打交道的，不再仅仅是书本和钢笔，而是要和锄头犁耙之类作伴了。生活上的这些变化，开始感到不大习惯，是很自然的现象。而且从事农业劳动，还是较为笨重的体力劳动，开始的时候，总会有些腰酸背疼之类的感觉。这些困难，只要事先有个比较正确的认识，思想上有一定的准备，就会慢慢地习惯起来，而在实际锻炼中，增强战胜困难的勇气，驾驭自然，战胜自然。乔继光当农民的事迹，就说明了这些道理。可不是吗？你看，乔继光刚回农村时，对新的生活也感到不习惯；但是他听党的话，有志气，终于战胜了各种困难，对农村生活逐步习惯起来。三十天中，做了四十个劳动日，思想觉悟也有了提高。因此，受到了人们的称赞：“看人家乔继光，拿起笔来能写会算，下了地生龙活虎！”
    要上好劳动第一课，不仅是青年学生本身的事，还有“教员”的问题。党倡导学校教师、学生家长等都来作“义务教员”，而农村的党、团基层组织应该担任“主讲教师”。可以利用个别谈话、组织参观、座谈等形式，向学生们介绍家乡变化情况和建设远景，使他们更加热爱农村，增强建设家园的信心。老社员们还需要对新参加农业生产的知识青年上“技术课”，帮助他们尽速学会生产本领，逐步对农业劳动产生感情。在生产和生活上，也要尽可能地给他们一些照顾，例如在安排农活时，可以由轻到重，由简到繁，在学习上给予一定的时间等等。乔继光所以奔赴农村，并愉快地开始劳动第一课，就是由于党、团组织教育的结果。
    随着形势的发展，将有更多的知识青年走上农业生产第一线。他们将和乔继光一样，要经过劳动第一课的锻炼。每一个决心到农村去的知识青年，都要立志上好第一课；农村的党、团基层组织，要帮助他们上好第一课。乔继光说得好：“农村的天地广大得很，像大游泳池，有本事你就使尽力气游吧，还怕创造不出新纪录来！”那么，我们就向乔继光那样，在农村这个大游泳池里，来个“八仙过海，各显其能”吧！
