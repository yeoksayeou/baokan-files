Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly concluded the debate on the issue of including the question of China's representation on the agenda of the General Assembly on October 8. Under the pressure and manipulation of the United States, the General Assembly adopted a US proposal submitted to the General Assembly for discussion, which the US forced the General Committee of the General Assembly to pass. This proposal recommends that the General Assembly reject the Soviet Union's suggestion to include the issue of China's representation on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly, and requests that the issue of restoring the lawful seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and expelling the Chiang Kai-shek elements from the United Nations not be considered during this session of the General Assembly.

However, the debate and voting results on the issue of China's representation at this session of the General Assembly show that the United States' policy of hostility towards the Chinese people and obstructing the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations for ten years has become increasingly unpopular.

During the General Assembly's debate on the issue of China's representation, despite engaging in various behind-the-scenes activities inside and outside the meeting and crudely exerting pressure on representatives from many countries, the final voting result yesterday showed that only forty-two votes supported the US proposal, two fewer votes than the US had mustered last year, while the number of countries opposing the US proposal increased by five compared to last year, reaching thirty-four. In addition, a large number of countries, regardless of US pressure, expressed their unwillingness to follow the US policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, and they abstained from voting. A total of twenty-two delegations abstained.

The thirty-four delegations that voted against the US proposal were: Afghanistan, Albania, Bulgaria, Burma, Byelorussia, Cambodia, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Ethiopia, Finland, Ghana, Guinea, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Ireland, Mali, Morocco, Nepal, Nigeria, Norway , Poland , Romania , Senegal , Sudan , Sweden , Ukraine , the Soviet Union , the United Arab Republic , Yemen , Yugoslavia .

The following abstained: Gabon, Iceland, Israel, Côte d'Ivoire, Laos, Libya, Madagascar, Niger, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Togo, Tunisia, Upper Volta, Austria, Cameroon, Central African Federation, Chad, Congo (former French Congo), Cyprus, Dahomey, Malaya.

The following voted in favor of the US proposal: United States, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Iran, Jordan, Liberia, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Federation of South Africa, Peru, Philippines, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, Venezuela, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Uruguay, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, and the Chiang Kai-shek elements.

Last year, Laos and Malaya, which supported the United States when the UN General Assembly voted on the issue of China's representation, abstained this year. Cuba and Ethiopia, which abstained last year, voted against the US proposal and in favor of the UN General Assembly discussing the issue of China's representation in this vote. Also voting against the US proposal this year were three newly admitted African countries to the United Nations - Mali, Senegal, and Nigeria. The other twelve newly admitted African countries to the United Nations and Cyprus abstained during the vote. Another newly admitted African country, the Republic of the Congo, was unable to send a representative to the meeting due to the division and chaos created by the imperialist countries led by the United States within the country. Harrison, the Associated Press's chief correspondent at the United Nations, admitted in a commentary that this vote on the issue of China's representation was a failure for the United States. He pointed out that the United States had originally hoped to win over some of the newly admitted African countries to support the US proposal, but the result was a complete failure.

At yesterday's conference, the United States also relied on its controlled voting machine to reject two amendments to the US proposal submitted by the General Committee by the Nepalese and Guinean delegations.

The United States' stubbornly hostile policy towards the Chinese people continued to be severely condemned by representatives of many countries at yesterday's General Assembly meeting.

Cuban Foreign Minister Roa said in his speech at yesterday morning's meeting that the issue of the People's Republic of China's representation has been submitted to the UN General Assembly for discussion for ten years, and regrettably, no appropriate resolution has been made so far. He said that it is now time to take a clear look at things. Roa pointed out that every time the General Assembly discusses the issue of China's representation, it is imposing the so-called General Committee's recommendation on the General Assembly, and this recommendation is based on the views of the US imperialist government, which aims to allow the Chiang Kai-shek elements in Taiwan to usurp the legitimate seat of the Chinese people in the United Nations.

The Cuban representative emphasized that this situation cannot continue. He pointed out that Cuba has now overthrown the rule of the United States and its supported puppet regime, gained full sovereignty and freedom, become an independent country, and has established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. The Cuban Foreign Minister stressed that the General Committee's recommendation violates the principles of the United Nations Charter. He said that the People's Republic of China is built on a solid foundation of the people, while the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan exists under the protection of the United States.

Finnish Foreign Minister Taugren supported the Soviet Union's proposal to include the issue of China's representation in the United Nations on the agenda of the General Assembly. He said that our delegation cannot understand how refusing to discuss this issue can help enhance the prestige of the United Nations. He pointed out that many member states of the United Nations, including Finland, have recognized the People's Republic of China and maintain normal diplomatic relations with it. He said that for many years, Finland has advocated restoring the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

Nepalese representative Shah said in his speech that no delegation was able to provide a reason to support the General Assembly not discussing the issue of the People's Republic of China's representation during the debate. Shah pointed out that the US delegation's attempt to undermine the UN Charter was unfounded. He said, "I cannot understand how a regime that neither controls territory nor represents the Chinese population can fulfill the UN Charter." He emphasized that there are not two Chinas in the world or in the United Nations. The Nepalese representative said that the issue of China's representation is related to the essence of our organization and should not be delayed, as this will create a threat to peace and security.

Moroccan Foreign Minister Mohammed requested a discussion on the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. He expressed surprise that some Western countries continue to obstruct the discussion of this issue in the General Assembly. The head of the Moroccan delegation pointed out that his country, along with thirty-four other countries in the world, has established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. He said that countries that obstruct the entry of representatives of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations should consider this fact.

Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko said in his speech at yesterday afternoon's meeting that those who oppose the People's China have cited many stale reasons. The Soviet Foreign Minister said that they insisted that the People's Republic of China has not behaved well, saying that China has not proven for a long time that its behavior meets the requirements of becoming a member of the United Nations. He asked, where does this "bad" behavior of the People's Republic of China manifest itself? Did the People's Republic of China send its troops to the coast of the United States? Did People's China occupy American islands? Are Chinese planes flying over US territory?

Gromyko stressed that the facts prove just the opposite. American troops occupy the Chinese territory of Taiwan and many Chinese coastal islands. The Americans occupy South Korea, approaching China's doorstep, and the United States has consistently violated the airspace of the People's Republic of China. Gromyko went on to say that any argument that the People's Republic of China's behavior makes it impossible for it to occupy a legitimate seat in the United Nations is unfounded and absurd.

Representatives from Spain, the Philippines, Australia, and other countries spoke successively at the meeting, trying their best to defend the US proposal. US Representative Wadsworth also used his right of reply at yesterday morning's meeting to once again slander China as "aggressive and bellicose."

After the vote ended, the chairman announced the adjournment, and the next meeting will be held on the 10th.

    联大在美国压力下决定不讨论中国代表权问题
    许多国家代表严斥美国敌视中国政策
    反对美国提案的国家比去年增多，很多国家不愿追随美国而弃权
    新华社9日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会10月8日结束了关于把中国代表权问题列入大会议程问题的辩论。在美国的压力和操纵下，大会通过了提交给大会讨论的美国强使大会总务委员会通过的一项美国提案，这个提案建议大会拒绝苏联提出的关于把中国代表权问题列入本届大会议程的建议，并且要求在本届大会期间不考虑有关恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位和驱逐蒋介石分子出联合国的问题。
    但是，本届大会关于中国代表权问题的辩论和表决结果表明，十年来美国敌视中国人民、阻挠恢复中国在联合国合法权利的政策，已经愈来愈不得人心。
    美国代表在大会辩论中国代表权问题的过程中，尽管在会内会外进行了种种幕后活动、粗暴地对许多国家代表施加压力，但昨天最后表决的结果，支持美国提案的只有四十二票，比去年美国所拼凑的票数少了两票，而反对美国提案的却比去年增加了五票，达到三十四票，另外还有大批国家不顾美国的压力，表示不愿追随美国敌视中国人民的政策，它们在投票中弃权。投弃权票的代表团共有二十二个。
    投票反对美国提案的三十四个代表团是：阿富汗、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、缅甸、白俄罗斯、柬埔寨、锡兰、古巴、捷克斯洛伐克、丹麦、埃塞俄比亚、芬兰、加纳、几内亚、匈牙利、印度、印度尼西亚、伊拉克、爱尔兰、马里、摩洛哥、尼泊尔、尼日利亚、挪威、波兰、罗马尼亚、塞内加尔、苏丹、瑞典、乌克兰、苏联、阿拉伯联合共和国、也门、南斯拉夫。
    投弃权票的是：加蓬、冰岛、以色列、象牙海岸、老挝、利比亚、马尔加什、尼日尔、葡萄牙、沙特阿拉伯、索马里亚、多哥、突尼斯、上沃尔特、奥地利、喀麦隆、中非联邦、乍得、刚果（前法属刚果）、塞浦路斯、达荷美、马来亚。
    投票支持美国提案的是：美国、英国、法国、意大利、日本、希腊、危地马拉、海地、洪都拉斯、伊朗、约旦、利比里亚、黎巴嫩、卢森堡、墨西哥、荷兰、新西兰、尼加拉瓜、巴基斯坦、巴拿马、巴拉圭、南非联邦、秘鲁、菲律宾、西班牙、泰国、土耳其、委内瑞拉、阿根廷、澳大利亚、比利时、乌拉圭、玻利维亚、巴西、加拿大、智利、哥伦比亚、哥斯达黎加、多米尼加、厄瓜多尔、萨尔瓦多和蒋介石分子。
    去年在联大表决中国代表权问题时支持美国的老挝和马来亚在今年投了弃权票，去年弃权的古巴和埃塞俄比亚在这次表决中投票反对美国提案和支持联合国大会讨论中国代表权问题。今年投票反对美国提案的还有新加入联合国的三个非洲国家——马里、塞内加尔和尼日利亚。新加入联合国的其他十二个非洲国家和塞浦路斯在表决时弃权。新加入联合国的另一个非洲国家刚果共和国由于以美国为首的帝国主义国家在国内制造的分裂和混乱局面而未能派代表出席会议。美联社驻联合国首席记者哈里逊在评论中承认，这次关于中国代表权问题的表决是美国的一次失败。他指出，原来美国曾希望拉拢一部分新加入联合国的非洲国家支持美国的提案，但是结果遭到彻底失败。
    在昨天的大会上美国还依靠它所控制的表决机器否决了尼泊尔和几内亚代表团对总务委员会提出的美国提案的两项修正案。
    美国顽固敌视中国人民的政策在昨天的大会会议上继续受到许多国家代表的严正谴责。
    古巴外交部长罗亚在昨天上午会议上的发言中说，中华人民共和国代表权问题提交联合国大会讨论已经有十年了，遗憾的是，迄今没有作出适当的决议。他说，现在已经是清醒地看一看事物的时候了。罗亚指出，每次联大讨论中国代表权问题时都是把所谓总务委员会的建议强加给大会，而这个建议是出于美国帝国主义政府观点的，它的目的是为了让台湾蒋介石分子窃踞中国人民在联合国的合法席位。
    古巴代表强调说，这种情况不能再继续下去了。他指出，古巴现在已经推翻了美国和它所支持的傀儡政权的统治，取得了充分的主权和自由，成为独立的国家，它已经同中华人民共和国建立了外交关系。古巴外长着重指出，总务委员会的建议违反联合国宪章的原则。他说，中华人民共和国是建筑在巩固的人民基础上的，而台湾的蒋介石集团是在美国的保护下而存在的。
    芬兰外长陶格伦支持苏联的关于把中国在联合国代表权问题列入大会议程的建议，他说，我们的代表团不能明白，拒绝讨论这个问题怎能有助于提高联合国的威信。他指出，许多联合国会员国，包括芬兰在内，承认了中华人民共和国，并且同它保持着正常的外交关系。他说，许多年来，芬兰主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位。
    尼泊尔代表沙阿在发言中说，在辩论过程中没有一个代表团能提出理由支持大会不应当讨论中华人民共和国代表权的问题。沙阿指出了美国代表团企图破坏联合国宪章的诡计毫无根据。他说，我不能明白，既没有控制领土，又不代表中国居民的政权能履行联合国的宪章。他强调指出，无论在世界上，还是在联合国都没有两个中国。尼泊尔代表说，中国代表权问题关系到我们组织的实质，不应当拖延解决这个问题，因为这将对和平和安全制造威胁。
    摩洛哥外交大臣默罕默德要求讨论中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权问题。他对某些西方国家仍然继续阻挠在大会上讨论这个问题表示惊讶。摩洛哥代表团团长指出，他的国家同世界上其他三十四个国家都同中华人民共和国建立了外交关系，他说，阻挠中华人民共和国代表进入联合国的国家应当考虑这个事实。
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在昨天下午会议上发言，他指出，反对人民中国的人列举了许多陈腐的理由。苏联外长说，他们硬说，中华人民共和国的行为不好，说什么中国长期以来没有证明自己的行为是符合成为联合国会员国的要求的。他质问道，中华人民共和国这种“不好”的行为表现在何处呢？是中华人民共和国把自己的军队派到美国的海岸吗？是人民中国占领了美国岛屿吗？是中国飞机在美国领土上空飞行吗？
    葛罗米柯着重指出，事实证明恰恰相反。美国军队占领了中国领土台湾和许多中国沿海岛屿。美国人占领了南朝鲜，逼近了中国的大门，美国一贯侵犯中华人民共和国的领空。葛罗米柯接着说，硬说中华人民共和国的行为不可能让它在联合国占有合法席位的任何论调，是毫无根据和荒谬的。
    西班牙、菲律宾、澳大利亚等国家的代表在会上相继发言，竭力为美国提案辩护。美国代表华兹沃斯在昨天上午也利用答辩权再次发言诬蔑中国“侵略和好战”。
    在表决结束以后主席宣布休会，下次会议将在10日举行。
