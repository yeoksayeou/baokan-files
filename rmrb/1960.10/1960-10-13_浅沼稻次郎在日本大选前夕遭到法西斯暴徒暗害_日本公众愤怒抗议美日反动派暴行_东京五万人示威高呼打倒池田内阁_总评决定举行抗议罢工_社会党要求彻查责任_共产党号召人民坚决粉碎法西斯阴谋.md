Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th Dispatch: Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Asanuma Inejirō was assassinated by fascist thugs this afternoon. This is part of a despicable measure by U.S.-Japan reactionaries to strike at the Socialist Party and Japanese democratic forces on the eve of the Japanese election.

This afternoon, Asanuma Inejirō delivered a campaign speech at the Hibiya Public Hall in Tokyo. He was strongly condemning the ruling Liberal Democratic Party for forcibly revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" without consulting the people and plotting to revise the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" to an audience of one thousand. At this moment, Yamaguchi Otoya, a member of the notorious fascist group "Greater Japan Patriotic Party" and an ally of the "Asian Anti-Communist Youth League," jumped onto the stage and stabbed Asanuma in the left armpit with a short knife. Asanuma lost his balance and fell in the middle of the stage, his blood splattering on the platform he used to expose and strike at the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. Socialist Party members and the audience immediately took him to the nearby Hibiya Hospital, but he died at 3:10 p.m. today due to his severe injuries.

When Yamaguchi Otoya committed the assassination, there were many plainclothes policemen and security personnel from the Liberal Democratic Party at the scene, but none of them stepped forward to stop the murderer. The criminal Yamaguchi Otoya was caught on the spot by the masses and handed over to the police authorities. This fascist thug had previously participated in criminal activities to sabotage the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and for peace.

Asanuma Inejirō was a politician respected by the Japanese people, and he made important contributions to the cause of Japan's independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality. He led Socialist Party delegations to visit China twice and made active efforts to promote friendly relations between Japan and China. Regardless of the threats and intimidation from U.S. imperialism, Asanuma Inejirō openly pointed out that "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Japanese and Chinese people" and "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Asian people." This aroused the hatred of U.S. imperialism. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II once extremely rudely demanded that Asanuma retract his condemnation of U.S. imperialism, but Asanuma insisted on his solemn position. He also actively participated in and led the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and against Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th Dispatch: Fifty thousand angry workers, students, and people from all walks of life in Tokyo shouted slogans such as "The Ikeda Cabinet should be held responsible!" and "Down with the Ikeda Cabinet that killed Asanuma!" held a rally and a large demonstration around the Japanese Diet and the Prime Minister's official residence, resolutely protesting against the reactionaries' murder of Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Asanuma Inejirō.

Tonight, the streets from Kasumigaseki Avenue, where the Japanese government agencies are located, to the Diet Building were packed with demonstrators arm in arm. Red flags and banners stood tall, and songs and slogans resounded through the sky. Japanese radio said: "The Diet surroundings, which had been calm since the Diet demonstration incident in June, are once again facing off against helmeted police, shrouded in a tense atmosphere."

Before the large demonstration, the masses first held a protest rally in Hibiya Park. After a minute of silence at the rally, a resolution was passed demanding the immediate resignation of the Ikeda Cabinet and the dismissal of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department Superintendent-General and other police chiefs responsible for the incident.

Socialist Party representative Kiyona Katsumada, General Council of Trade Unions of Japan Chairman Kaoru Ota, and Communist Party representative Shigeo Kamiyama spoke at the rally, strongly condemning the Ikeda government's support for fascist terrorist activities.

Kiyona Katsumada emphasized that the attack on his party's chairman was also an attack on all Japanese people who love democracy and peace. He emphasized that the Ikeda Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party should be held responsible for this brutal incident.

Kaoru Ota said that terrorist means are the last resort organized by U.S. imperialists and Japanese monopoly capital, who have been driven to a dead end by the overwhelming struggle of the Japanese people. He went on to say: "If the peace-loving Japanese people unite as one, they will surely win and crush all terrorist conspiracies."

Kaoru Ota said that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan will hold a protest strike just as they did in the movement against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

Shigeo Kamiyama called on workers to hold a general strike to fight back against the vicious attack by U.S. imperialists and the Japanese monopoly capitalist group.

After the mass rally, the participants began to demonstrate. Socialists led the procession. The demonstrators carried thousands of red flags, all bearing symbols of mourning. Crowds filled the downtown streets of Tokyo, then marched to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, the Diet, and the Prime Minister's official residence, shouting: "Murderer Ikeda resign!" "Down with fascism!" "Let's hold a general strike!"

Demonstrators demonstrated in front of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, shouting: "Give us back Asanuma!" "The police chief resign!" The demonstration continued until late at night.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th Dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan held a special meeting this afternoon and decided to hold a nationwide general strike on the 15th to protest the murder of Socialist Party Chairman Asanuma Inejirō.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan also issued a statement tonight emphasizing that the Ikeda Cabinet should immediately resign en masse and be held responsible for its secret and open assistance to fascist thugs and the assassination of Asanuma. The statement pointed out, "The Ikeda Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party are the real murderers."

The statement said: "Whenever a strike or mass rally is held, the government always dispatches a large number of police officers. The police tacitly allow many professional thugs to carry weapons to important public gatherings attended by the leaders of the three political parties, which is effectively turning a blind eye to the assassination of the Socialist Party Chairman," the statement sharply criticized the collusion between the police authorities and fascist elements.

The statement said: "This incident is not accidental." "Under the guise of democracy, the government is determined to foster fascist forces in an attempt to use their violence to suppress trade unions and progressive groups."

The statement said that the workers will rise up unanimously and take strong protest actions against the Ikeda Cabinet.

The powerful union with 3.7 million members will also hold protest demonstrations and rallies tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th Dispatch: The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement this evening regarding the assassination of Chairman Asanuma. The statement pointed out: "Chairman Asanuma was stabbed to death by the pawns of monopoly capital and reactionaries while he was shouting in support of the Constitution today." "This is not only a terrorist act against the Socialist Party, but also an open provocation against the people of the whole country who defend peace and democracy."

The statement said: "We believe that the responsibility lies not only with the security authorities but also with the political power itself, which is the background to violence. We will thoroughly investigate this responsibility. At the same time, we will protest and fight for the defense of democratic politics."

The statement said, "Chairman Asanuma's spirit will forever guide our party forward." The statement also called on the people of the whole country to join the Socialist Party in fighting to completely eliminate fascist violence.

At the same time, the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party held an emergency meeting this afternoon and decided to hold a large-scale protest rally nationwide on the 15th to resolutely protest the reactionaries' murder of Socialist Party Chairman Asanuma Inejirō. The Socialist Party has issued instructions to the party organizations in each prefecture for this purpose.

At the emergency meeting, the Socialist Party also decided: not to agree to the extraordinary session of the Diet scheduled for October 17 unless the Ikeda Cabinet clearly expresses its responsibility for the assassination of Socialist Party Chairman Asanuma Inejirō.

The emergency meeting of the Central Executive Committee also decided to hold a funeral for Asanuma Inejirō, hosted by the Socialist Party and attended by people from all walks of life. The meeting also decided to add to the agenda of the Socialist Party's national congress to be held tomorrow the issue of discussing the Socialist Party's protest movement against Asanuma's assassination.

This afternoon, the Tokyo headquarters of the Socialist Party was crowded with angry party members and guests, expressing condolences for Asanuma's assassination.

Socialist Party member Kanjuro Kato said indignantly after hearing the news of Asanuma's death: "We know that the ruling class hates him." He said that the Socialist Party will use all its strength to eliminate this rampant atrocity of fascist elements.

He indignantly emphasized: "The murder of our chairman is enough to show the true nature of Ikeda's policy. This policy has once again been proven to be extremely anti-people and closely linked to violence."

Socialist Party Supreme Advisor Jotaro Kawakami told reporters today, demanding that the Ikeda government, which is responsible for this terrorist incident, immediately implement a full resignation.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th Dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement today on the assassination of Asanuma, calling on all Japanese people to rise up and take strong protest actions against the reactionary forces that planned this vicious murder.

The statement pointed out: "The dagger that stabbed Chairman Asanuma Inejirō to death is aimed at the workers, peasants, and all Japanese people. This murder is the result of the vicious instigation of reactionary forces, who have a deep hatred for the Japanese people's democratic movement for peace, independence, and neutrality."

The statement emphasized: "No matter who directly planned this murder, U.S. imperialists and the Japanese monopoly capitalist group should be held responsible for this murder."

The statement said: "The working class and the Japanese people must take strong protest actions to crush the Ikeda Cabinet's conspiracy to restore fascist rule in our country."

The statement emphasized: "Prime Minister Ikeda, who is responsible for this murder, should resign immediately. The Communist Party demands the immediate dissolution of all fascist organizations and the dismissal of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department Superintendent-General and the leaders of the police authorities who are responsible."

The statement concluded: "Let us launch strong protest actions, including strikes, demonstrations, and mass rallies, to concentrate our fire on the Ikeda Cabinet."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th Dispatch: The news of the assassination of Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Asanuma Inejirō has aroused unparalleled anger and strong protests from the Japanese public.

Five conferences being held in Tokyo against unemployment and poverty decided to launch immediate protest actions. Representatives from all over the country attending the meeting spoke one after another with indignation. Some pointed out that the assassination of Asanuma Inejirō is the result of the evil U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" system. Many said that protest actions must be taken immediately. Everyone also unanimously condemned the police for failing to prevent the assassination.

Vice Chairman of the All Japan Metal Workers' Union Minoru Takano told reporters: "The nature of the Ikeda Cabinet as a fascist government has been fully exposed."

Minoru Takano said: "In the face of this heinous incident, socialists, communists, and all other progressives should unite and begin to step up the anti-fascist struggle."

He emphasized: This is an urgent time. Therefore, all the people should do their utmost to overthrow the Ikeda Cabinet and replace it with a government of peace, democracy, and neutrality.

President of the Japan Women's Organizations Federation Michiyo Kushida emphasized to reporters: "All Japanese people feel deep grief and express strong anger. I think: a large-scale protest action like the anti-'Security Treaty' movement should be launched immediately."

The Japan-China Friendship Association issued a statement tonight saying, "We believe that the Ikeda Cabinet should be held responsible for the assassination of Socialist Party Chairman Asanuma Inejirō. We condemn with great anger those who support this bloody incident and those who try to benefit from this incident."

The statement said that the Japan-China Friendship Association will continue to complete the tasks left behind by the late Asanuma Inejirō and fight against U.S. imperialists and for friendship with China.

    东京五万人示威高呼打倒池田内阁　总评决定举行抗议罢工
    社会党要求彻查责任　共产党号召人民坚决粉碎法西斯阴谋
    据新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎今天下午被法西斯暴徒杀害。这是美日反动派在日本大选前夕企图打击社会党和日本民主力量的卑鄙措施的一部分。
    今天下午，浅沼稻次郎在东京日比谷公会堂发表竞选演说。他当时正在向一千名听众强烈地谴责执政的自由民主党不征询国民的意见，强行修改日美“安全条约”，并阴谋修改“警察官职务执行法”。这时，臭名远扬的法西斯团体“大日本爱国党”的成员和“亚洲反共青年联盟”盟员山口二矢跳上讲台，用短刀刺入浅沼的左腋。浅沼站立不住，跌倒在讲台中间，鲜血洒在他用以揭露和打击美日反动派的讲台上。社会党员和听众随即将他送到附近的日比谷医院，但因伤势过重，于今天下午三时十分去世。
    当山口二矢行刺时，现场有许多便衣警察，还有许多自由民主党的警卫人员，但是他们没有一个人上前阻止杀人犯。凶犯山口二矢是当场被群众抓住的，并交给了警察当局。这个法西斯暴徒过去曾经多次参与破坏日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约、争取和平的正义斗争的罪恶活动。
    浅沼稻次郎是受到日本人民尊敬的政治家，他为争取日本的独立、和平、民主、中立的事业作出了重要的贡献。他曾经率领社会党代表团两次访问中国，为促进日中两国的友好关系作了积极的努力。浅沼稻次郎不顾美帝国主义的恐吓威胁，公开指出：“美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人”，“美帝国主义是亚洲人民的共同敌人”。这引起了美帝国主义的仇恨。美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二曾经极端蛮横无理地要求浅沼收回他对美帝国主义的谴责，但是浅沼坚持了严正的立场。他并且积极参加和领导了日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约、反对艾森豪威尔访问日本的反美爱国斗争。
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：东京五万名愤怒的工人、学生和各界人民高呼“池田内阁应该负责！”
  “打倒杀害浅沼的池田内阁！”等口号，举行大会并在日本国会和首相官邸周围举行大示威，坚决抗议反动派杀害日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎。
    今天晚上，从日本政府机关所在的霞关大街到国会大厦的马路上挤满了手臂挽着手臂的示威游行的群众。红旗和标语牌林立，歌声和口号声接连不断，响彻天空。日本电台说：“从6月的国会示威事件以来很平静的国会周围，示威队伍同头戴钢盔的警察再次对峙，笼罩着紧张的气氛”。
    在大示威举行以前，群众首先在日比谷公园举行了抗议大会。大会默哀一分钟后，通过决议，要求池田内阁立即辞职，并把东京警视厅总监和其它应对这次事件负责的警察长官撤职。
    社会党代表胜间田清一和日本工会总评议会议长太田薰、共产党代表神山茂夫在大会上讲话，强烈谴责池田政府支持法西斯分子的恐怖行动。
    胜间田清一着重指出，对他的党的委员长的进攻也是对爱好民主与和平的全日本人民的进攻。他着重指出，池田内阁和自由民主党应对这个残暴事件负责。
    太田薰说，恐怖手段是被日本人民声势浩大的斗争弄得走投无路的美帝国主义者和日本垄断资本组织的最后一手。他接着说：“如果爱好和平的日本人民团结一致，他们必将获胜，粉碎一切恐怖阴谋”。
    太田薰说，“总评”工人正像他们在反对修改“安全条约”运动中一样，将举行抗议罢工。
    神山茂夫呼吁工人举行总罢工，来反击美帝国主义者和日本垄断资本集团的狠毒进攻。
    在群众大会之后，与会者开始举行示威。社会党人走在队伍的最前列。示威者拿着成千的红旗，旗上都有致哀的标志。成山成海的人群挤满了东京闹市的大街，他们然后列队走向东京都警视厅、国会和首相官邸，高呼：“杀人犯池田辞职！”“打倒法西斯主义！”“让我们来举行总罢工！”
    示威者在东京都警视厅面前举行示威，高呼：“把浅沼还给我们！”“警察头子辞职！”示威一直继续到深夜。
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天下午举行特别会议，决定在15日举行全国大罢工，抗议杀害社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎。
    “总评”并且在今晚发表声明强调指出，池田内阁应当立即总辞职，对它秘密地和公开地帮助法西斯暴徒和浅沼的被刺负责。声明指出，“池田内阁和自由民主党是真正的凶手。”
    声明说：“每当举行罢工或群众集会，政府总要出动大批警察，警察默许许多职业打手携带武器参加三位政党领袖出席的重要的公众大会，实际上是对暗杀社会党委员长采取视而不见的态度”，声明尖锐地指责警察当局和法西斯分子同谋。
    声明说：“这次事件不是偶然的。”“在民主的幌子下，政府一心要扶植法西斯势力，企图借他们的暴力来镇压工会和进步团体。”
    声明说，工人们将一致奋起，对池田内阁采取强硬的抗议行动。
    这个拥有三百七十万会员的强大工会还将在明天和后天举行抗议示威和集会。
    据新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天傍晚就浅沼委员长被刺死的事件发表声明。声明指出：“当浅沼委员长今天正在高呼拥护宪法时，被垄断资本和反动派的爪牙刺死。”“这不仅是恐怖主义对社会党而且也是对保卫和平和民主的全国人民的公开的挑衅。”
    声明说：“我们认为，这个责任不仅在于治安当局而且也在于成为暴力的背景的政治权力本身。我们要彻底追究这种责任。同时要进行抗议，为拥护民主政治而斗争。”
    声明说，“浅沼委员长的精神将永远引导我党前进。”声明并且呼吁全国人民为完全扫除法西斯暴力而同社会党共同斗争。
    同时，社会党中央执行委员会今天下午举行紧急会议，决定15日在全国举行大规模抗议集会，坚决抗议反动派杀害社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎。社会党并为此向各县党组织发出了指示。
    在紧急会议上，社会党还决定：不同意国会定于10月17日举行临时会议，除非池田内阁明确地表示对社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎的被刺负责。
    中央执行委员会紧急会议还决定为浅沼稻次郎举行由社会党主持和广大阶层人民参加的葬礼。会议还决定在明天召开的社会党全国代表大会的议程中增加关于讨论社会党对浅沼被刺的抗议运动的问题。
    今天下午，社会党的东京总部挤满了愤怒的党员和来宾，为浅沼被刺表示哀悼。
    社会党议员加藤勘十在听到浅沼逝世的消息后愤慨地说：“我们知道，统治阶级仇恨他。”他说，社会党将以它的全部力量来消灭法西斯分子这种猖狂的暴行。
    他愤慨地着重指出：“对我们委员长的谋害足以显示池田的政策的真正性质。这种政策再次被证明是极端反人民的，并同暴力紧紧联在一起。”
    社会党最高顾问河上丈太郎今天向记者发表谈话，要求对这次恐怖事件负责的池田政府迅速实行全体辞职。
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本共产党今天就浅沼被杀害事件发表声明，号召全体日本人民起来对策划这个狠毒的谋杀案的反动势力采取强有力的抗议行动。
    声明指出：“刺死浅沼稻次郎委员长的匕首是针对着工人、农民和全体日本人民的。这次谋杀是反动势力恶毒唆使的结果，这些反动势力对日本人民争取和平、独立和中立的民主运动，有着刻骨的仇恨。”
    声明强调指出：“不管直接策划这个谋杀案的人是谁，美帝国主义者和日本垄断资本集团应对这个谋杀案负责。”
    声明说：“工人阶级和日本人民必须采取强有力的抗议行动，来粉碎池田内阁企图在我国恢复法西斯统治的阴谋。”
    声明强调说：“对这个谋杀案负有责任的池田首相应该立即辞职。共产党要求立即解散各个法西斯组织，并将东京都警视厅总监和负有责任的警察当局领导人免职。”
    声明最后说：“让我们来发动强有力的抗议行动，包括举行罢工、示威和群众大会，集中火力打击池田内阁。”
    据新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎被暗杀的消息激起日本公众的无比愤怒和强烈抗议。
    正在东京举行的反对失业和贫困的五个会议决定立即展开抗议行动。出席会议的全国各地代表一个接一个义愤填膺地起来发言。有人指出，浅沼稻次郎的被暗杀是万恶的美日“安全条约”体系的结果。许多人说，必须立即采取抗议行动。大家还一致谴责警察没有能够阻止这次暗杀行动。
    全日本金属工会副主席高野实向新闻记者发表谈话说：“池田内阁作为法西斯政府的性质已经暴露无遗”。
    高野实说：“面对着这一凶恶事件，社会党人、共产党人和其他所有进步人士应该团结起来，并着手加紧进行反法西斯斗争”。
    他强调指出：这是紧急的时机。因此全体人民应竭尽全力来推翻池田内阁，并代之以和平、民主和中立的政府。
    日本妇女团体联合会会长櫛田蕗向新闻记者强调指出：“全体日本人民深感哀痛并表示强烈的愤怒。我认为：应该立即发动像反对‘安全条约’运动那样的大规模抗议行动”。
