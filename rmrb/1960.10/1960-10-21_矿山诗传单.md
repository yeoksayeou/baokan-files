    Mine Poetry Leaflet
    Yan Yi
    Written on the Rock Walls of the Mine
    Here is neither day nor night,
    Here is neither dawn nor dusk,
    Every day has one thousand four hundred and forty minutes,
    Each minute is a time for Great Leap Forward.
    The pneumatic drill, pickaxe, and drill rod,
    Are the clock's minute and second hands,
    The miner's habit of calculating time,
    Is how many tons of coal are mined each shift.
    Written on the Pneumatic Drill
    Pneumatic drill, my old partner,
    You once went with me to Korea,
    The tunnels under Shangganling,
    Forced the American imperialists to sit down and negotiate.
    Pneumatic drill, my old partner,
    You've come with me to the mine again,
    Do you know that your rotation speed,
    Is written into the national industrialization plan.
    Pneumatic drill, my old partner,
    Did you hear the call of the Party Central Committee,
    The motherland, ah, must advance at high speed,
    This is also our common aspiration.
    Pneumatic drill, my old partner,
    Turn faster, ah, even faster,
    Do you know that your sound,
    Makes the imperialists restless day and night.
    Written on the Working Face
    The coal mining working face,
    Is a high-yield field cultivated by miners,
    The pneumatic drill is the plow, the pickaxe is the sickle,
    What is harvested is shining coal.
    This year's harvest, ah, is also good;
    Look, the motherland's steel is about to increase again.
    Written on the Compressor
    If the pneumatic drill and pickaxe are machine guns,
    The compressed air is the bullet,
    We are the ammunition handlers,
    Supporting the charging soldiers.
    Pneumatic drill, dig quickly,
    Pickaxe, mine coal quickly,
    On the battle line of national industrialization,
    We are the same fighting corps.
    Written on the Steep Rock
    This is an underground steep rock,
    Specially designed to harm the careless,
    Whoever is careful and bold,
    It will become obedient.
    Comrades, remember safe production,
    This is the Party's concern for the miners.
    Health is the wealth for building the motherland,
    Good health will speed up our progress.

    矿山诗传单
    雁翼
    写在矿井岩壁
    这里没有白天，也没有黑夜，
    这里没有黎明，也没有黄昏，
    每天一千四百四十分钟呵，
    分分都是跃进的时辰。
    风钻风镐和钻孔机杆，
    就是钟表的分针和秒针，
    矿工计算时间的习惯呵，
    是每一班又采了煤炭多少吨。
    写在风钻上
    风钻呵，我的老伙伴，
    你曾和我到过朝鲜，
    那上甘岭下的坑道呵，
    曾迫使美帝坐下来和谈。
    风钻呵，我的老伙伴，
    你又跟我来到了矿山，
    你可知道，你的转动速度，
    写进了祖国工业化的方案。
    风钻呵，我的老伙伴，
    党中央的号召你可听见，
    祖国呵，要高速度前进，
    这也是咱俩共同的志愿。
    风钻呵，我的老伙伴，
    转快一点呀再快一点，
    你可知道，你的声响，
    使帝国主义日夜不安。
    写在掌子面
    采煤掌子面，
    矿工种的高产田，
    风钻是犁，风镐是镰，
    收割的是闪光的煤炭。
    今年的收成呵，又不错；
    看，祖国的钢铁又要加番。
    写在压缩机上
    假如风钻风镐是机枪，
    压缩的风呵就是子弹，
    我们就是弹药手，
    把冲锋的战士支援。
    风钻呀，快快掘进，
    风镐呀，快采煤炭，
    在祖国工业化的战线上，
    我们是同一个战斗兵团。
    写在陡岩上
    这是一座地下的陡岩，
    专把粗心大意的人陷害，
    谁要是细心而又大胆，
    它就会变得乖乖。
    同志们，要牢记安全生产，
    这是党对矿工的关怀。
    身体是建设祖国的财富，
    身体好，前进的速度才能加快。
