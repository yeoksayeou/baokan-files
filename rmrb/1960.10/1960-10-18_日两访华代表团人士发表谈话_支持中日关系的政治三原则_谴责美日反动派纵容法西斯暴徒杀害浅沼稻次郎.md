　　Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, October 17th: Takeo Toeba, Central Executive Committee member of the Japan Socialist Party and head of the Japanese National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty delegation, told Hong Kong journalists yesterday: The American and Japanese reactionaries' connivance with fascist thugs to murder Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma will never shake the Japanese people's determination to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance. The Japanese people will never allow the tragedy directed by Japanese militarism in the past to be repeated.

　　Toeba expressed extreme grief and indignation at the murder of Inejiro Asanuma, saying: After returning to Tokyo, I am determined to inherit Inejiro Asanuma's will and make the greatest effort to improve Sino-Japanese relations.

　　Toeba also expressed support for the three political principles for Sino-Japanese relations put forward by China, saying: Abiding by these three political principles is the minimum condition for improving Sino-Japanese relations. Not only do the Japanese people and the Japan Socialist Party support these three principles, but there are also enlightened people within the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party who support these three principles.

　　After ending his visit to China, Toeba arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou on the 15th and took a plane back to Japan on the 16th. He returned home first after hearing the news of Inejiro Asanuma's murder in China.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, October 17th: The second batch of Japanese Socialist Party agricultural delegation, a group of fourteen people, led by head Tatsu Shohara, arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou on the 16th.

　　The delegation's spokesperson, Osamu Tanabe, issued a statement while hosting Hong Kong newspaper reporters, condemning the American and Japanese reactionaries for conniving with fascist thugs to murder Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma. He pointed out: The assassination of Chairman Asanuma exposed the reactionary nature of the Japanese conservative parties and further proved that their touted "democracy" and "peace" are deceptive.

　　Regarding the current Sino-Japanese relations, Tanabe said: To restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and trade, it is necessary to base it on the three political principles put forward by the Chinese side.

    户叶武对浅沼稻次郎的被害表示十分悲愤，他说：我回东京后决意继承浅沼稻次郎的遗志，为日中两国关系的改善尽最大的努力。
    户叶武还表示支持中国提出的中日关系的政治三原则，他说：遵守这政治三原则是改善日中两国关系的起码条件，不单是日本人民和日本社会党支持这三项原则，而且在日本自由民主党有识之士中也有人支持这三项原则。
    户叶武结束了在中国的访问以后，15日从广州抵达香港，16日乘飞机转道回日本，他是在中国听到浅沼稻次郎被害消息后先行回国的。
