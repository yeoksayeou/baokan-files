Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 3rd. The editorial department of the Korean "Rodong Sinmun" stated today, when publishing the news of the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, that the Korean people warmly support and welcome the signing of this treaty.

The editorial department of "Rodong Sinmun" pointed out that the signing of this boundary treaty effectively resolved the Sino-Burmese boundary issue, a remnant of long-term imperialist aggression and colonial rule. The signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty is a victory for friendly cooperation between China and Burma and for the friendship and solidarity of the Asian people. It is an example of resolving outstanding issues through negotiation based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit. It clearly proves that there are no disputes that cannot be resolved through negotiation and consultation between friendly countries engaged in a common struggle against imperialism and for peace and security.

The editorial department of "Rodong Sinmun" said that the People's Republic of China, based on the essence of its social system, has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy and has made sincere efforts to unite the forces of the Asian people in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty has made a valuable contribution to further strengthening and developing the friendly relations between China and Burma, strengthening the forces of the Asian people against imperialism and colonialism, and safeguarding the cause of peace in Asia. At the same time, this is a huge blow to the US imperialists who attempt to sow discord among the Asian people in order to profit from it.

    “劳动新闻”编辑部指出，这一边界条约的签订，有成效地解决了帝国主义者长期侵略和殖民统治的遗物——中缅边界问题。中缅边界条约的签订，是中缅两国间的友好合作和亚洲人民的友好和团结的胜利，是基于和平共处五项原则和万隆精神、以谈判的方法解决悬而未决的问题的榜样。它清楚地证明，在为反对帝国主义、争取和平和安全而进行共同斗争的友好国家之间，没有以谈判和协商的方法解决不了的任何争端。
      “劳动新闻”编辑部说，中华人民共和国从它的社会制度的本质出发，始终一贯地奉行着爱好和平的对外政策，并在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中，为了团结亚洲人民的力量，作了真挚的努力。中缅边界条约的签订对进一步加强和发展中缅两国间的友好关系、加强亚洲人民的反对帝国主义和殖民主义的力量、维护亚洲和平的事业，作出了宝贵的贡献。同时，这对企图离间亚洲人民以便从中取利的美帝国主义者是一个巨大的打击。
