    Master-Apprentice Furnace

    Before the announcement of the ten-day evaluation results of the furnace group competition at the Second Steelmaking Plant of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, the atmosphere was as tense and moving as a thrilling sports meet reaching its final moment. The "Battle Bulletin" in front of the plant revealed that by 3:30 PM, Furnace No. 8 and Furnace No. 11 had equal cumulative steel production, while Furnace No. 7 lagged behind by twenty-five tons. Who would lead this ten-day period depended on the final eight hours of the decisive battle.

    At this time, the fire in Furnace No. 8 in the plant was blazing. The workers knew that the furnace would need to be repaired in two hours, so they were busy adding materials, clearing the site, and rushing to produce a few more heats of steel. Furnace No. 11 had just been repaired and was preparing to start production. The workers of Furnace No. 7 were climbing on the furnace body to rush repairs. According to the operational rules of the converter, although Furnace No. 8 had the same output as Furnace No. 11 and was currently blowing, it would soon need to be repaired; Furnaces No. 11 and No. 7 were not blowing, but were standing on the starting line, and as long as the molten iron arrived, they had the hope of surpassing Furnace No. 8 in the last eight hours.

    At exactly 4:00 PM, Furnace No. 7 was repaired. Whether Furnace No. 7 or Furnace No. 11 could overtake Furnace No. 8 depended entirely on who could blow faster after the molten iron arrived. The workers were all eager to try and ready for action. However, after a while, news came from the iron-smelting furnace: now, the molten iron could only supply one furnace for blowing. According to the usual practice, Furnace No. 11 was repaired first, and the molten iron should be given priority. Therefore, some people were eager to conclude this competition: "Furnace No. 11 is leading." At the critical moment, Master Worker Wang Fuguan, the furnace operator of Furnace No. 11, suddenly gestured and directed the crane operator to transfer a package of molten iron from the top of his furnace to Furnace No. 7. He then followed the molten iron package in stride to Furnace No. 7 and said to Guo Jiaxing, the furnace operator of Furnace No. 7: "Be steady when starting a new furnace." He also stared at the fire color and pointed out: "Rock the angle shallower, shallower..."

    Wang Fuguan gave up the right of their Furnace No. 11 to compete for the championship to Furnace No. 7 and personally helped Furnace No. 7 operate, which immediately aroused people's discussion. Some said that Wang Fuguan favored his apprentices; others said that Furnace No. 11 was full of veteran workers and did not compete with young people.

    Furnace No. 11 and Furnace No. 7 are "master-apprentice furnaces" and are arranged side by side at both ends of the plant. Now, the twenty-one people in the three shifts of Furnace No. 7 are all young men who were still apprentices in front of Furnace No. 11 a few months ago. The three furnace operators in charge, Guo Jiaxing, Yi Shengdian, and Ren Wanyin, had all been assistants to Wang Fuguan, Wang Hushan, and others, the furnace operators of Furnace No. 11. After the furnaces were separated in April this year, the young men of Furnace No. 7, like newly married daughters, would come back to ask for advice whenever they had difficulties in operation. The veteran workers of Furnace No. 11 were very concerned about Furnace No. 7. In addition to carefully helping them technically, they always gave priority to Furnace No. 7 whenever the two furnaces shared a crane to pour molten iron or cast ingots. Under the guidance of the veteran workers of Furnace No. 11, the young men of Furnace No. 7 quickly learned to repair and start furnaces independently. However, they did not stick to the existing technical level of the veteran workers. While learning the blowing technology of Furnace No. 11, they boldly created a complete set of experience of "three shifts for one furnace, grasping blowing and turnover together." Since May this year, Furnace No. 7 has been continuously rated as the red flag furnace of the whole company. In early September, all furnaces, shifts, and groups in the plant formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and set off a competition upsurge of "learning from Furnace No. 7, catching up with Furnace No. 7, and surpassing Furnace No. 7." Challenge letters, determination letters, and response letters flew to the Party Committee office like snowflakes.

    The veteran workers of Furnace No. 11, seeing everyone busily catching up with Furnace No. 7, were not willing to lag behind, but were embarrassed to issue a challenge letter to their apprentices. One day, Chen Xingwang, deputy secretary of the Party General Branch of the workshop, patted Wang Fuguan on the shoulder and said: "Old Wang, your apprentices are really remarkable, now they have left you behind, how are you going to deal with it?" This sentence reminded Wang Fuguan. After work, he held a joint meeting of the three shifts with Wang Hushan and Du Daorong, the other two shift furnace operators. Everyone analyzed the advantages of Furnace No. 7 and compared and checked their own shortcomings. Communist Party member Wang Hushan said: "In the past, we always felt that we had a set of blowing technology that young people could not easily learn, but these young men are 'grasping blowing with one hand and turnover with the other,' not only has their blowing technology improved rapidly, but the furnace repair time is also greatly shortened than ours. We have to speed up and catch up!" Wang Fuguan said excitedly: "Furnace No. 7 is three shifts for one furnace, creating conditions for each other. We sometimes only want to produce a few more heats of steel in our own shift. When it's time to hand over the shift, not only are the converter and iron-smelting furnace empty, but sometimes the slag is not cleaned up, which causes inconvenience to the next shift." The more they discussed, the higher the enthusiasm, and the veteran workers put down their master's airs and wanted to compete with Furnace No. 7. They decided on the spot on three steps to surpass Furnace No. 7: catch up in output in the first five days, surpass in the next five days, and then firmly plant the red flag of high yield and high quality on the top of their furnace in the next five days. This was not reassuring enough. Like playing basketball, they launched a one-on-one contest with Furnace No. 7 by furnace, shift, and person: Wang Hushan of Group A against Ren Wanyin, Wang Fuguan of Group B against Guo Jiaxing, and Du Daorong of Group C against Yi Shengdian. In the end, they all made guarantees: "We must not lag behind by one ton of steel in our own shift."

    When Furnace No. 11 was studying countermeasures to catch up with Furnace No. 7, Du Daorong's group of Group C was repairing the furnace. After the meeting, everyone said: Shortening the turnover time by one hour can produce six more tons of steel. We must learn from the method of the three shifts of Furnace No. 7 working together to rush to repair the furnace. They appropriately adjusted manpower, strengthened the furnace repair force, and improved the operation method. The planned furnace repair time was thirty hours, but it actually only took fifteen hours.

    The next day after the furnace was repaired, Furnace No. 11 and Furnace No. 7 happened to be blowing at the same time. Wang Fuguan and his apprentice Guo Jiaxing arrived at their respective furnaces on time. They did not challenge each other face to face, but they both had a burning ambition to win first place in their hearts. The equipment and raw material conditions of the two furnaces were the same, but the operating techniques were different. Wang Fuguan, known for his experience and calmness, aimed to win by increasing the output per unit area, loading one ton more pig iron than usual in each heat; Guo Jiaxing, known as the "fast-smelting vanguard," loaded less material than Wang Fuguan, but could produce a heat of steel in twenty minutes. While nervously rocking the furnace and adding materials, they also seized the spare time to go to the ingot casting platform to calculate their output and inquire about the other party's number of steel-producing furnaces. This shift of Furnace No. 7 produced two more heats of steel. After work, Wang Fuguan felt uncomfortable in his heart because he felt that his shift had lagged behind in output, and he was determined to catch up. He summed up the lessons of the day, and the next day he adopted the method of expanding the loading capacity and shortening the auxiliary time. As soon as he started work, he organized the entire shift of workers and the iron-smelting furnace and ingot crane workers to carry out a collaborative competition. In this shift, Wang Fuguan's shift achieved both more loading and faster smelting, and the output exceeded Guo Jiaxing's shift.

    Wang Fuguan led the workers of Furnace No. 11 and surpassed Furnace No. 7 for several consecutive days. Guo Jiaxing was a little anxious. On September 20, the two furnaces met again to blow at the same time. On this day, the molten iron had a high sulfur content. Wang Fuguan's steelmaking has always been based on changes in raw material conditions, and he changes the operating technology at any time. He knew that the molten iron had a high sulfur content, so he had to make more slag. Therefore, as soon as he started work, he organized everyone to add lime diligently. However, Guo Jiaxing still blew at full blast and quickly, producing more heats, but some of them were unqualified. In the same time, although Wang Fuguan's shift only smelted two heats, all of them were qualified. When calculating the output, it exceeded Guo Jiaxing's shift. At this time, Guo Jiaxing hurriedly ran to Furnace No. 11 and asked: "Master Wang, why are there so many defective products today?" Wang Fuguan hurried to Furnace No. 7 and told him: "If the molten iron has a high sulfur content today, you have to make slag diligently and appropriately extend the blowing time." In this shift, Wang Fuguan commanded the workers to operate in Furnace No. 11 for a while, and ran to Furnace No. 7 to guide the operation of Guo Jiaxing's shift for a while. He did not leave Furnace No. 7 until the defective products were completely eliminated.

    The ten-day furnace-to-furnace evaluation was approaching, and there were only eight hours left. When the "Battle Bulletin" revealed the results of their battle, Furnace No. 7 was repairing the furnace. Wang Fuguan could fully understand the tense mood of the workers in Furnace No. 7. When the molten iron could not supply the two furnaces for blowing at the same time, he immediately discussed with the entire shift of workers: "Furnace No. 7 is our factory's red flag and our pacesetter. In order to maintain our factory's red flag, how about we give them the molten iron?" At that time, individual workers said: "We have spent a lot of effort to catch up for more than ten days. If we give them the molten iron at the critical moment, it will be in vain." Wang Fuguan patiently but firmly said: "We are competing for steel, but not just for the red flag!" All the team members agreed with Master Wang's opinion.

    At midnight, the results of the furnace-to-furnace competition in the whole plant were announced. Furnaces No. 7 and No. 11 encouraged each other and helped each other, and the steel output increased by about 20% compared with the previous ten days. Everyone cheered for Furnace No. 7 to maintain the red flag, and at the same time praised the noble style of the workers of Furnace No. 11.

    师徒炉
    太钢第二炼钢厂炉群竞赛的旬评比揭晓前，像一场精彩的运动会到了决战时刻那样紧张、动人。厂房前的“战斗快报”上揭示着：到下午三点半，八号炉和十一号炉累计产钢量相等，七号炉拉下二十五吨。究竟这一旬谁来领先，要看最后八小时的决战。
    这时，厂房里八号炉的炉火正旺。工人们知道再过两个小时就要修炉了，都忙着加料、清场，抢着多出几炉钢。十一号炉刚修好，正在准备开炉。七号炉工人们正爬在炉身上抢修炉子。按照转炉运转规律，此刻八号炉虽然产量和十一号炉持平，并且正在吹炼，但它快要修炉了；十一号炉、七号炉没有吹炼，可是正站在起跑线上，只要铁水一来，在最后八小时都有超过八号炉的希望。
    下午四时整，七号炉抢修完毕。究竟是七号炉，还是十一号炉能赶过八号炉，全看铁水来了以后，谁家吹炼得快。工人们都在摩拳擦掌，严阵以待。可是，不一会，化铁炉上传来消息：现在，铁水只能供应一个炉吹炼。照例十一号炉先修好炉，铁水应该优先供应，于是有人急于为这一场竞赛下结论：“十一号炉领先了。”正在决定关头，忽然十一号炉司炉王富官老师傅摆开手势，指挥吊车工，把一包铁水从自己的炉顶上转倒进七号炉去了。他又跟着铁水包健步跑到七号炉前，向七号炉司炉郭家兴说：“新开炉可要稳些。”他又盯着火色指点说：“摇的角度浅些、再浅些……”
    王富官把他们十一号炉争夺冠军的权利让给七号炉，又亲自帮助七号炉操作，顿时引起人们的议论。有的说，这是王富官偏爱徒弟；有的说，人家十一号炉尽是些老师傅，不和青年人比高低。
    十一号炉和七号炉是“师徒炉”，并排在厂房的两端。现在七号炉三个班的二十一个人都是青年小伙子，几个月前还都在十一号炉前当徒工。领班的三个司炉郭家兴、义生典、任完印，都当过十一号炉司炉王富官、王虎山等的助手。今年4月间分炉以后，七号炉的小伙子们像刚出嫁的姑娘，操作上一有困难，都随时回来请教。十一号炉的老师傅们对七号炉十分关心，除了从技术上细心帮助外，凡是遇到两个炉子共用一个吊车倒铁水或铸锭时，总是尽先让给七号炉。在十一号炉老师傅们的指导下，七号炉这帮小伙子很快就能独立修炉、开炉了。但是，他们没有拘泥在老师傅的现有技术水平上，在学习十一号炉的吹炼技术的同时，又大胆创造出“三班为一炉，吹炼、周转一齐抓”的一整套经验。从今年5月份以来，七号炉连续被评为全公司的红旗炉。9月上旬，全厂各炉、班、小组都制订出增产节约计划，掀起了“学七炉、赶七炉、超七炉”的竞赛热潮，挑战书、决心书、应战书像雪片似地飞到党委办公室。
    十一号炉的老师傅们看着大家都在热火朝天地赶七号炉，也不甘落后，但又不好意思给徒弟们下战书。一天，车间党总支副书记陈兴旺拍着王富官的肩膀说：“老王，你们的徒弟真不得了，现在把你们抛在后面了，你们怎么应付呀？”这句话提醒了王富官。下班以后，他就同另两班的司炉王虎山、杜道荣召开了个三班联合会议。大家分析了七号炉的优点，对照、检查了自己的缺点。共产党员王虎山说：“过去我们老觉得自己吹炼技术有一套，青年人不容易一下学到，可是这帮小伙子们是‘一手抓吹炼、一手抓周转’，不只吹炼技术提高很快，修炉时间也比我们大大缩短了。咱们得快马加鞭赶上去！”王富官激动地说：“人家七号炉是三班为一炉，互相创造条件，我们有时只为本班多出几炉钢，到交班时转炉、化铁炉都空了不说，有时渣子也清理不完，给下班造成不方便。”越议论，热气越高，老师傅们都放下师傅架子，要和七号炉比高低。他们当场商定超七号炉的三个步骤：头五天产量上赶上，后五天超过，再过五天把高产、优质的红旗牢牢地插在自己炉顶上。这还不放心。他们像打篮球一样，按炉、按班、人盯人和七号炉展开对手赛：甲班王虎山对任完印，乙班王富官对郭家兴，丙班杜道荣对义生典。末了，又都提出保证：“决不能在自己班上拉一吨钢。”
    十一号炉研究赶七号炉的对策时，正当丙班杜道荣小组修炉。散会后，大伙说：周转时间缩短一小时，就能多出六吨钢。我们要学七号炉三班大联合作业的办法抢修炉子。他们适当调配了人力，加强了修炉力量，并且改进了操作方法，本来修炉时间计划用三十个小时，实际只用了十五个小时。
    炉子修好的第二天，正碰上十一号炉、七号炉同时吹炼。王富官和他的徒弟郭家兴准时来到各自的炉前。他们两人没有当面挑战，但内心里都蕴藏着争第一的炽热的雄心。两个炉的设备、原料条件一样，可是操作技术各不相同。素称老练、沉着的王富官以提高单位面积产量致胜，每一炉装的生铁比往常多了一吨；号称“快炼闯将”的郭家兴装的料虽然不如王富官多，但二十分钟就能出一炉钢。他们一方面紧张地摇炉、加料，一方面抓紧空闲时间到铸锭台前算计自己的产量，询问对方的出钢炉数。这一班七号炉多做了两炉钢。下班后，王富官觉得自己班上拉下了产量，心里怪不舒服，决心要把拉下的赶回来。他总结了这天的教训，第二天采取了扩大装入量和缩短辅助时间并举的方法，一上班就组织全班工人和化铁炉、铸锭吊车工开展了协作赛。这一班，王富官班做到了多装又快炼，产量超过了郭家兴班。
    王富官带领着十一号炉的工人，连续几天超过了七号炉。郭家兴有些着急。9月20日，两个炉又碰上同时吹炼。这天，铁水含硫较高。王富官炼钢一向是根据原料条件的变化，随时变更操作技术。他知道铁水含硫较多，就得多造渣，因此一上班就组织大伙勤加石灰。但是郭家兴仍是满风、快吹，炼的炉数多，但是有的不合格。在同一个时间里，王富官班虽然只炼了两炉，可是全部合格，一算产量，超过了郭家兴班。这时，郭家兴急忙跑到十一号炉前问：“王师傅，怎么今天的废品多？”王富官赶紧跑到七号炉前，告诉他：“像今天铁水含硫高，就得勤造渣，适当延长点吹炼时间。”这一班，王富官一会在十一号炉指挥工人们操作，一会跑到七号炉前指导郭家兴班操作。直到彻底杜绝了废品，他才离开七号炉。
    一旬一次的炉与炉评比迫近了，就剩下最后八小时了。当《战斗快报》揭示出他们之间的战果时，七号炉正在修炉。七号炉工人紧张的心情，王富官完全能理解。当铁水不能同时供应两个炉子吹炼时，他立刻同全班工人商量：“七号炉是我们全厂的红旗，是我们的标兵，为了保持我们全厂的红旗，我们把铁水让给他们怎么样？”当时个别工人说：“我们费了九牛二虎之力，赶了十几天，临到紧要关头，把铁水让给他们，不是白搭了。”王富官耐心地但坚定地说：“我们是争钢，可不是只为争红旗呀！”全体组员都同意了王师傅的意见。
  　子夜零点，全厂炉与炉竞赛评比结果揭晓了。七号、十一号两个炉互相激励，互相帮助，钢产量都比上旬提高20％左右。大家都为七号炉保持红旗而喝彩，同时为十一号炉工人们的高尚风格赞不绝口。
