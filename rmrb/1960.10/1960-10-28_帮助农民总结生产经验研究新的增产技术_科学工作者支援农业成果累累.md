Xinhua News Agency, 27th. Since the Party Central Committee issued the call for all sectors to support agriculture, the movement of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and its affiliated institutions to broadly support agriculture has reached a climax. The Academy has established an office to support agriculture; many disciplinary research units are conducting research related to agriculture; more than forty research units have newly added research topics related to agriculture; more than forty of the research results related to agriculture that have already been made can now be promoted and applied.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the vast number of farmers in our country have created rich production experience in their production practice. Helping farmers sort out, summarize, and improve these experiences, and on this basis research better and newer yield-increasing technologies, is a major task placed on the shoulders of scientific workers. Many research units have already made considerable achievements in this area. For example, the Institute of Soil Science has summarized several key measures in soil, fertilizer, and water aspects from the experience of high-yield wheat in the south; a series of technical measures to improve the soil have been taken on the "horse liver soil" (low-yield fields) in Jiangsu Province, so that the wheat yield per mu in the rice-wheat rotation has reached 500 jin. Applying an appropriate amount of lime to red soil land has increased rice production by 10% to 20%. Dipping rice seedlings roots in ammonium sulfate or superphosphate has also increased rice production by 10% to 20%. In order to solve the problem of easy volatilization and loss of ammonia fertilizer in rural areas south of the Yangtze River during storage and application, the Institute of Soil Science cooperated with Wuxi Agricultural School to conduct experiments on composting grass pond mud and ammonia. Preliminary results show that this method can prevent the volatilization loss of ammonia, accelerate the decomposition of grass pond mud, improve fertilizer efficiency, and overcome the shortcomings of crops being prone to lodging when ammonia is applied alone. In summarizing the deep plowing experience of the old farmer Ma Tongyi in Changge County, Henan, the Institute of Soil and Water Conservation theoretically studied the law of soil-fertilizer fusion. This research has important guiding significance for rational deep plowing and rational fertilization, thereby accelerating soil ripening and improving fertility. The Forest Soil Institute's research on the use of industrial wastewater (containing nitrogen fertilizer) to irrigate rice has recently achieved satisfactory results. Fushun farmers have been using industrial wastewater to irrigate rice for twenty years, but there are three drawbacks: easy occurrence of greedy growth, lodging, and rice blast. Now, this institute has found methods to overcome the three drawbacks and has researched methods to control the concentration of harmful substances in industrial wastewater. This year, it was promoted and tested in the Lishizhai Commune in Fushun, irrigating 8,500 mu of rice fields, and none of the above three problems occurred. A large-scale bumper harvest is expected. According to statistics, there is a lot of petroleum industrial wastewater and domestic sewage in Fushun throughout the year. In the past, only 10% was used to irrigate rice fields. If it can be fully utilized, it can irrigate 2.4 million mu. The Institute of Hydrobiology has been studying high-quality fertilizer nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae for many years. Experimental results have proved that it is a promising fertilizer source. The amount applied per mu is only about 5 jin, and the cost per jin is about 2 jiao 5 fen. It can be propagated to about 1,000 jin within a year, and the fixed nitrogen is equivalent to about 90 to 100 jin of ammonium sulfate or 3,000 to 4,000 jin of pig manure. The yield per mu is generally increased by about 10% compared with the control fields.

In terms of crop protection, scientific workers have also made contributions. The Institute of Entomology has trial-produced a new insecticide, which is very toxic to agricultural pests with chewing mouthparts, but has very little toxicity to humans and animals. Field trials have proved that this drug is very effective in controlling cotton bollworms, especially for old cotton bollworms, its effectiveness exceeds DDT and other existing drugs. Field trials have proved that it also has a good control effect on rice borers. The Institute of Geography has produced a frost predictor with a cost of only eight yuan, which can automatically emit a bell three hours in advance to predict the arrival of frost.

In order to improve labor efficiency and save labor, the Institute of Mechanics has studied the method of using explosives instead of manpower in projects such as well digging, dam construction, and land plowing. The Institute of Mathematics assisted Shandong Province in summarizing the experience of using linear programming (a method in operations research) in Shandong, and in the Beijing area, cooperated with more than ten units such as Peking University and Beijing Normal College to help rural people's communes rationally arrange the setting of threshing grounds, saving a lot of labor.

Our country is a country with very rich plants. The comprehensive utilization of wild plants is a very broad research field. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has already done a lot of investigation and research work in this area. For example, the Kunming Institute of Botany and the South China Botanical Garden have preliminary results in the research on the propagation of oil dregs fruit. Oil dregs fruit is a perennial wild oil plant in southern China. It grows rapidly, is easy to cultivate, and the seeds contain a lot of oil. The oil tastes very similar to lard, so it is very worthy of promotion and planting in the south. The Institute of Hydrobiology has researched a new harvesting method in the process of studying the cultivation of Chlorella and Scenedesmus, which can avoid the mixing of dust impurities and is simple and convenient. The Institute of Forest Soil, the Institute of Microbiology, and many other units have also made new achievements in the comprehensive utilization of wild plants and agricultural by-products.

Using scientific achievements to support agriculture is regarded as one of the most important and glorious tasks in many research institutions under the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In mid-September, the Department of Biology organized a team mainly composed of the Beijing Institute of Plant Physiology, with the participation of research and teaching institutions in soil, plants, mathematics, and atomic energy, to be stationed in the Zhongde Friendship People's Commune in Chaoyang District, Beijing, to carry out the summary and research work of high-yield wheat experience. The Institute of Mathematics has established research bases in Tong County and Jiulong Mountain near Beijing, and is studying the use of linear programming to solve problems for rural people's communes such as rational allocation of labor, transportation, earthwork transportation in water conservancy projects, agricultural statistics and agricultural estimation, crop layout and rotation. The Forest Soil Institute mobilized three-quarters of the institute's strength to go deep into production practice, closely integrate with the masses, and study ten agricultural-related issues such as fertilizers. The Institute of Soil Science organized a team of twenty-seven research and technical personnel, which set off in mid-September to participate in the investigation of autumn-ripe crops in Jiangsu, to help summarize the experience of Jiangsu Province in changing low-yield to high-yield and high-yield to higher-yield in crops such as rice, and to propose yield-increasing measures for next year.

The branches of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in various places have also actively organized local research forces to solve scientific and technological problems in agricultural production. The Shanghai Branch formulated more than 100 research topics including summarizing agricultural high-yield experience, fertilizers, pesticides, etc., and established six special groups such as pesticides and the application of microorganisms in agriculture; organized extensive cooperation and exchange of experience between various research institutes. The Jilin Branch and the Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Commission jointly organized a technical support agriculture team of more than 100 people, including fifteen professional groups such as machinery, chemical industry, hydropower, and civil engineering, and went to various rural people's communes in the province to help the communes solve more than 200 scientific and technological problems in production. The other branches in various places are also actively carrying out research work in various disciplines in supporting agriculture.

    帮助农民总结生产经验研究新的增产技术
    科学工作者支援农业成果累累
    新华社27日讯　在党中央提出了各行各业支援农业的号召以后，中国科学院及所属机构广泛支援农业的运动达到了高潮。院部已成立了支援农业办公室；很多学科的研究单位都进行着有关农业的研究工作；有四十多个研究单位新增加了有关农业的研究课题；已经作出的有关农业的研究成果中有四十多项现在就可以推广应用。
    大跃进以来，我国广大农民在生产实践中创造了丰富的生产经验。帮助农民整理、总结、提高这些经验，并且在这个基础上研究出更好更新的增产技术，是放在科学工作者肩上的重大任务。许多研究单位在这方面已经作出了不少成果。例如土壤研究所总结出了南方小麦丰产经验中土、肥、水方面的几个关键性的措施；在江苏省的“马肝土”（低产田）上采取了一系列改良土壤的技术措施，使稻麦轮作的小麦亩产量达到五百斤，在红壤地上每亩施用适量的石灰，使水稻增产了10％到20％，用硫酸铵或过磷酸钙沾秧根，也使水稻增产10％到20％。为了解决长江以南地区农村中氨水肥料在贮藏和施用时容易挥发损失的问题，土壤研究所同无锡农业学校合作，进行了草塘泥和氨水混合沤肥的试验，初步结果表明，采用这种方法可防止氨水挥发损失，并可加速草塘泥的腐烂分解，提高肥效，还可以克服单独施用氨水时作物容易倒伏等缺点。土壤与水土保持研究所在总结河南长葛县老农马同义的深翻经验中，从理论上研究了土肥相融的规律，这项研究对于合理深耕和合理施肥从而加速土壤熟化、提高肥力，具有重要的指导意义。林业土壤研究所对利用工业废水（含有氮肥）灌溉水稻的研究最近获得了满意的结果。抚顺农民利用工业废水灌溉水稻已有二十年历史，但存在着三个弊病：易发生贪青、倒伏和稻热病。现在这个研究所找出了克服三个弊病的方法，并且研究出了控制工业废水中有害物质浓度的方法，今年在抚顺李石寨公社推广试验，灌溉八千五百亩稻田，都没有发生上述三种毛病，可望获得大面积丰收。据统计，抚顺全年石油工业废水和生活污水很多，过去只利用了10％来灌溉稻田，如能全部利用，可灌溉二百四十万亩。水生生物研究所研究优良肥料固氮蓝藻已有多年，实验结果证明它是一种大有发展前途的肥源，每亩施用量只需五斤左右，每斤成本约二角五分，一年之内可以繁殖到一千斤左右，固定的氮素约相当于九十斤到一百斤硫酸铵或三千到四千斤猪粪。亩产量比对照田一般增加10％左右。
    在农作物保护方面，科学工作者也作出了贡献。昆虫研究所试制成了一种新的杀虫药剂，对咀嚼式口器的农业害虫毒性很大，而对于人畜的毒性则很小，经田间试验证明，这种药防治棉铃虫的效果很好，特别是对于老龄的棉铃虫，效力超过滴滴涕和其他已有的药剂；田间试验证明对螟虫的防治效果也很好。地理研究所制成了成本只有八元的霜冻预报器，可以在三小时以前自动发出铃声，预报霜冻来临。
    为了提高劳动效率、节约劳动力，力学研究所研究了在掘井、筑坝、翻地等工程中应用爆炸代替人力的方法。数学研究所协助山东省总结了山东运用线性规划（运筹学中的一种方法）的经验，并且在北京地区与北京大学、北京师范学院等十多个单位协作，帮助农村人民公社合理安排打麦场的设置，节省了大量劳动力。
    我国是一个植物非常丰富的国家。野生植物的综合利用是一个十分广阔的研究领域。中国科学院在这一方面已经作了大量的调查研究工作。如昆明植物研究所和华南植物研究所对于繁殖油渣果的研究已有初步结果。油渣果是我国南方的一种多年生的野生油料植物，生长迅速，培植容易，种子含油很多，油味酷似猪油，所以很值得在南方推广种植。水生生物研究所在研究培殖小球藻、栅藻的过程中，研究出了一种新的收获方法，可避免尘埃杂质混入，并且手续简单方便。林业土壤研究所、微生物研究所等许多单位在研究综合利用野生植物和农业副产品方面也都作出了新的成就。
    用科学成果支援农业在中国科学院所属的许多研究机构中都被当作最重要最光荣的任务之一。生物学部在9月中旬组织了以北京植物生理研究室为主，有土壤、植物、数学、原子能等方面的研究、教学机关参加的一支队伍，长驻在北京朝阳区中德友好人民公社开展小麦丰产经验的总结研究工作。数学研究所在北京近郊通县和九龙山建立了研究基地，正在研究用线性规划为农村人民公社解决劳动力合理安排、运输、水利工程中土方运送、农业统计和农业估产、作物布局和轮种等问题。林业土壤研究所动员了全所四分之三的力量，深入生产实际，与群众密切结合，研究肥料等方面的十个有关农业的问题。土壤研究所组织了一支由二十七个研究、技术人员组成的考察队，已在9月中旬出发参加江苏秋熟作物的考察工作，帮助总结江苏省水稻等作物低产变高产、高产更高产的经验，并且提出明年的增产措施。
    中国科学院各地分院也都积极组织当地研究力量解决农业生产中的科学技术问题。上海分院制订了包括总结农业丰产经验、肥料、农药等内容的一百多个研究课题，成立了农药、微生物在农业中的应用等六个专题小组；组织了各研究所之间的广泛协作和经验交流。吉林分院和吉林省科学技术委员会共同组织了一个一百多人的支援农业技术团，包括机械、化工、水电、土木建筑等十五个专业、小组，分赴全省各农村人民公社，帮助公社解决了大小二百多项生产中的科学技术问题。其他各地分院都同样在支援农业方面积极开展着各个学科的研究工作。
