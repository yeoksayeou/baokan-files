    My big brother came home from the province,
    Joined the production team that very day,
    Pushing a cart to deliver manure,
    Squeaking, squeaking, running so fast.
    My sister-in-law's face broke into a smile,
    Quickly chasing after him,
    Offering him a waistband,
    So big brother could wipe away sweat.
    The small team leader was filled with joy,
    Cadres come to the front line,
    Big brother has loved labor since he was little,
    Literate and martial, he can do everything.
    Dad nodded his head upon seeing this,
    He said big brother is doing the right thing,
    Agricultural labor is so glorious,
    Truly a good descendant of the peasants.

    我的大哥真光荣
    金近
    大哥从省里回家来，
    当天参加生产队，
    推着小车去送粪，
    吱呀吱呀跑得快。
    嫂嫂见了笑脸开，
    跟在后面赶快追，
    送上一条缚腰带，
    好让大哥擦汗水。
    小队长见了心欢喜，
    干部来到第一线，
    大哥从小爱劳动，
    文的武的样样会。
    爸爸见了点点头，
    他说大哥做得对，
    农业劳动多光荣，
    实在是农民的好后代。
