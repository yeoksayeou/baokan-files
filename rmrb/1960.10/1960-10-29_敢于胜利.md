    Daring to Win
    Zhou Ji
    On the Liancheng Peninsula, eight young women crossed ten miles of sea, conquered a barren island, and vigorously developed grain production. This is a magnificent picture, a paean to overcoming difficulties.
    There are many difficulties in conquering the wilderness across the sea. They had to cross the turbulent waves of the ten-mile sea, cut through thorns, resist storms, and endure the torment of hunger and thirst... Under the leadership and support of the Party, the eight heroines were not afraid of these difficulties, overcame these difficulties, and made the barren land where "sea birds flew over without landing" grow abundant grain. No one knows how many centuries have passed, but Dazhu Island has been lying there silently, with no one to develop it. Eight young women with sixteen hands drew a picture of "a grand plan arising ten miles overseas." Without arduous struggle, how can there be a bright future? It is precisely, "The sharp edge of a sword comes from sharpening, and the fragrance of plum blossoms comes from bitter cold."
    Not being afraid of difficulties, overcoming difficulties, being good at struggle, and daring to win. This is a firm and thorough spirit. The youth of our era must possess this spirit. To make revolution, one cannot be afraid of difficulties. Overcoming one difficulty is like climbing one step, and overcoming another difficulty is like climbing another step. If you want to climb high, you cannot be afraid of the difficulty of climbing mountains; if you want to achieve victory, you should not hesitate to put in effort. The plains are easy to walk, but there is no way to rise to a new height. Stepping on difficulties under your feet? Or letting them block your way? The question is sharp and allows no ambiguity. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "If you don't strike at reactionary things, they won't fall," "If the broom doesn't sweep, the dust will not run away by itself," "Don't lie in bed and think that a gust of wind will come and blow all the dust away. We Marxists are revolutionary realists and never engage in empty fantasies." These words of Chairman Mao were directed at the political struggle against the reactionaries, but today, when we apply them to the struggle to change nature, the principle is equally applicable. The deeds of the eight women crossing the sea to conquer the wilderness show that as long as there is a firm will, coupled with arduous and unremitting practice, not being afraid of difficulties, and bravely overcoming them, one will definitely be able to create heroic achievements. Their spirit is in the same vein and resonates with the fighting spirit of our revolutionary predecessors who struggled hard to win the victory of the revolution. Continuing the past and opening up the future, advancing without hesitation, young people must bravely take on this burden.
    Facing the picture of the eight women crossing the sea to conquer the wilderness, it will surely arouse reverie in young people. The heroic deeds of the eight women encourage them with great courage. Some people can't wait to spread their wings and fly to a similar island to vigorously develop agriculture, to paint moving pictures, and to write paeans to overcoming difficulties. This kind of spirit is naturally good. However, those who dare to win must dare to overcome difficulties in various places and positions, and must be good at finding ways to victory from difficulties. Therefore, one must stand firm and fight in one's own location, fight in the places where the Party and the country need them, and fight in one's own production team. Do not be a vague and缥渺 dreamer, but be a revolutionary realist who dares to think and act and is also down-to-earth. In these places, it may not seem so exciting now, but these places are also places where heroes can use their talents. Don't think it's too ordinary and you can't do a sensational career, so you don't deal with it seriously. Seemingly ordinary careers need to be carried on seriously, dealt with seriously, and sustained unremitting efforts made to turn them into extraordinary careers. Dazhu Island lay there for many centuries, and it was very ordinary. After the battle of the eight women, it became extraordinary and became a treasure island. If there had been no battle of the eight women, wouldn't Dazhu Island still be a barren island? Dazhu Island is like this, and why aren't all places like this; the eight women are like this, and why can't the youth of all places be like this! It depends on human effort, the heavens are opened by people, and the land is reclaimed by people. The reason why humans are the "spirit of all things" is that they should be the masters of nature, not slaves. Now a large number of young people are settling down in the countryside, determined to do agriculture for a lifetime. It seems very ordinary to go to ordinary rural areas, but in fact it is very extraordinary, because they are determined to deal with it seriously and have the confidence to dare to win and overcome difficulties. Today, we want to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. Of course, this is not the same as fighting on the battlefield during the war years, but the battlefield and the farm can compete, and guns and hoes can make contributions in the same way, and we must deal with them seriously. Today, many local youths are fighting on the front line of agricultural production, although not as much as the eight women crossing the sea to conquer the wilderness, but the spirit and energy of the eight women crossing the sea to conquer the wilderness can be used anywhere.

    敢于胜利
    周集
    莲城半岛上，八个青年妇女，跨过十里海面，征服荒岛，大办粮食。这是一幅色彩瑰丽的画面，一首战胜困难的赞歌。
    跨海征荒，困难很多，要渡过十里海面的汹涌波涛，要披荆斩棘，要抵御暴风雨的袭击，要忍受饥渴的折磨……八位女英雄在党的领导和支持下，不怕这些困难，战胜这些困难，使过去“海鸟飞过不落脚”的荒废之地，长出了丰盛的粮食。也不知多少世纪过去了，大竹岛默默地躺在那里，没有人去开发。八个青年妇女八双手，就描出了一幅“十里海外起壮图”的画面。不经艰苦奋战，锦绣前程何有？正是，“宝剑锋从磨砺出，梅花香自苦寒来。”
    不怕困难，战胜困难，善于斗争，敢于胜利。这就是坚定的和彻底的精神。我们时代的青年，都要具有这种精神。要革命，就不能怕困难。克服一个困难，便登上了一级石阶，再克服一个困难，便又登上了一级石阶。要想登得高，就不能害怕爬山的困难；要想取得胜利，就应当毫不吝惜地付出一番力气。平原倒是好走，然而无从升到新的高度。把困难踩在脚底下？还是让它挡在脚面前？问题尖锐，不容含糊。毛泽东同志说：“反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒”，“扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉”，“不要躺在床上，以为会来一阵什么大风，把灰尘统统刮掉。我们马克思主义者是革命的现实主义者，绝不作空想。”毛主席的这些话，当时是指对反动派的政治斗争的，而今天把它用在改变自然的斗争中，这个道理也同样适用。八女渡海征荒的事迹，说明只要有了坚定的意志，再加上艰苦卓绝的实践，不怕困难，勇敢地去战胜困难，就一定能创造出英雄的业绩。他们的精神同我国革命前辈艰苦奋斗赢得革命胜利的战斗精神是脉络相承，声息相通的。继往开来，所向无前，青年人要勇于挑起这副担子。
    面对着八女渡海征荒的画面，一定会引起青年人的遐思。八女的英雄事迹，鼓舞起他们极大的勇气。有些人恨不得奋起双翮，飞到同样一个岛上，大办农业，去描下动人的画面，写下战胜困难的赞歌。这样的精神自然是好的。但是，敢于胜利的人，一定要敢于在各种地方、各个岗位上战胜困难，要善于从困难中找出胜利的途径。所以，必须立足于自己所在的地方战斗，在党和国家需要自己去的地方战斗，在自己的生产小队中战斗。不要作一个虚无缥渺的空想家，而要作一个敢想敢干而又脚踏实地的革命的现实主义者。在这些地方，现在也许看起来不那么有声有色，但是，这些地方也是英雄用武之地，不要认为太平凡了，做不出轰轰烈烈的事业，因而就不去认真对付。看起来是平凡的事业，正需要认真干下去，认真对付，进行持久不懈的努力，把它变成不平凡的事业。大竹岛躺在那里多少世纪，也很平凡，经过八女的战斗，就不平凡，成了宝岛。如果没有八女的战斗，大竹岛还不是个荒岛？大竹岛如此，各地又何尝不如此；八女如此，各地青年又何尝不可以如此！事在人为，天在人开，地在人辟。人之所以成为“万物之灵”，就在于要作自然的主人，而不是作奴隶。现在大批青年到农村安家落户，决心干一辈子农业，看起来到普通的农村中去，好像很平凡，可是，实际上这就很不平凡，因为他们下决心去认真对付，有了敢于胜利和战胜困难的信心。我们今天要大办农业，大办粮食，这和过去战争时期在战场上打仗当然不是一回事，但是战场农场同可比武，枪杆锄头一样可以立功，都要认真对付。今天许多地方青年在农业生产第一线上战斗，虽然不尽如八女渡海征荒那样，但是，八女渡海征荒的那个精神，那个劲头，在任何地方都使用得上。
