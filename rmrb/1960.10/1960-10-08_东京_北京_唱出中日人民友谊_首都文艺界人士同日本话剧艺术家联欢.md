Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Our reporter Wang Boqing reports: Beijing is already deep in the night, but the exciting song of "Tokyo-Beijing" still echoes in the auditorium of the Xinqiao Hotel. Here, people from the capital's literary and art circles are holding a get-together with the friendship envoys of the Japanese people—the artists of the Japanese Drama Troupe—to celebrate the friendly ties and strong unity between Chinese and Japanese artists, and to congratulate the great success of the revolutionary Japanese Drama Troupe's performances in Beijing.

During their stay in Beijing, the Japanese Drama Troupe artists, with their rich and colorful performances full of life and fighting spirit, introduced the life of the Japanese people and their heroic struggle against the United States and for patriotism, and conveyed the deep friendship of the Japanese people towards the Chinese people, leaving a deep impression on our audience. The Japanese Drama Troupe artists are about to leave Beijing for visits and performances in other places, spreading the seeds of friendship of the Japanese people to other parts of our country.

The Xinqiao Hotel auditorium presented a joyous scene. Chandeliers hung with red tassels shone brightly in the auditorium, which was decorated with evergreen palm trees and blooming potted flowers. Hanging on the walls were five large red brocade banners, presented to the Japanese Drama Troupe and the Japanese Tokyo Art Troupe, Min'i Troupe, Haiyuza Troupe, Budokai Troupe, and Bungakuza Troupe that make up the drama troupe by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Chinese Dramatists Association. The banner presented to the Japanese Drama Troupe read: "Drama is a precious mirror reflecting the life and struggle of the people, and also a link to strengthen the unity and friendship of the people of all countries, acting as a rooster crowing at dawn to fight for the light for the world!" There were also Chinese color paintings and poems inscribed by Guo Moruo, all presented as gifts of friendship to the Japanese artists. Famous figures from China's literary, drama, dance, music, fine arts, and film circles attended the gathering. Among them were Guo Moruo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Vice Chairmen Lao She and Xu Guangping, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Vice Presidents Yang Hansheng, Xia Yan, and Zhang Zhixiang, Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, and Vice Chairmen Ouyang Yuqian and Mei Lanfang, and Lü Ji, Chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association. When the head of the Japanese Drama Troupe, Murayama Tomoyoshi, deputy heads Chida Koreya, Takizawa Osamu, Yamamoto Yasue, Sugimura Haruko, and the artists of the drama troupe, along with Japanese peace figure in Beijing, Saionji Kinkazu, entered the auditorium, the Chinese hosts applauded warmly, shook hands and greeted each other, thanking the Japanese artists for their performances, which brought encouragement and support to the Chinese people.

Yang Hansheng spoke at today's gathering, emphasizing that the friendship between Chinese and Japanese artists is a brotherly friendship and a fighting friendship. Yang Hansheng said that we have the common goal of opposing the aggression of U.S. imperialism and defending peace in Asia and the world, and the common desire to develop our respective national cultures and arts and to develop the friendship and cultural exchange between the people of China and Japan. We all understand that in order to achieve these goals and desires, we need to support and encourage each other, so the people and literary and art circles of our two countries are closely linked.

Yang Hansheng pointed out that the joint visit to China by the five Japanese drama troupes is a powerful rebuff to the provocative conspiracies of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and a glorious victory for the great unity of the Chinese and Japanese people. Yang Hansheng concluded enthusiastically, "Let us unite even more closely and move forward, forward, and forward again towards our great common goal."

Murayama Tomoyoshi, head of the Japanese Drama Troupe, thanked the Chinese hosts for their warm welcome in his speech, pointing out that Chinese and Japanese artists are close comrades-in-arms in the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

Murayama Tomoyoshi said that the Japanese people, as a member of the fight to drive U.S. imperialism out of Asia, have resolutely stood up, and the Japanese people are by no means cowards who will long endure the enslavement of U.S. imperialism.

Murayama Tomoyoshi said that imperialism will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history, and we still face complex tasks of struggle. He said that the most important task at present is to drive U.S. imperialism out of Asia and gradually thwart U.S. imperialism's plot to provoke a world war. He said that after returning to Japan, we will further and vigorously fight for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Yang Hansheng and Murayama Tomoyoshi's enthusiastic speeches aroused strong echoes, and Chinese and Japanese artists burst into enthusiastic applause.

Friendly feelings embraced the Chinese and Japanese artists tightly together, and everyone gathered around the table for a cordial chat, took photos together, signed autographs for each other, and the sounds of laughter and applause intertwined. During the gathering, Guo Moruo, Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Mei Lanfang, and Chida Koreya, deputy head of the Japanese Drama Troupe, all raised their glasses to toast for closer cooperation between the theatrical circles of China and Japan and for the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan. Everyone then raised their glasses and drank.

The party then began. Accompanied by gongs and drums, Chinese and Japanese artists sang and danced lightly, celebrating the unforgettable gathering of art comrades from the two countries. As the night grew late, people became even more excited, arm in arm, singing "Socialism is Good" and "Tokyo-Beijing" with great enthusiasm.
