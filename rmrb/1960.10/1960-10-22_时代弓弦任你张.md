    The Bowstring of the Era is Yours to Draw
    Wang Lao Jiu
    The bugle sounds in Beijing,
    "Go all out for agriculture" spreads in all directions,
    Young comrades take the lead,
    A million strong army toils for grain.
    Six hundred million of divine China's mountains and rivers are magnificent,
    The agricultural front is filled with joy,
    Wang Baojing runs everywhere,
    Billions of Zhang QiuXiang fly in.
    The rivers of Sichuan and Yanhe flow long,
    The pagodas on the mountains shine golden,
    The Yan'an spirit is mighty,
    Let you cleverly groom the Earth.
    Refine red people with red thoughts,
    As strong as Anshan's high-quality steel,
    Stand firm when the wind blows and the grass stirs,
    Capture dragons, subdue tigers, and sweep away jackals.
    Be a pace-setter, become a famous general,
    Hold the sparks of youth in your hands,
    Sweat unlocks the door to happiness,
    Embroider prosperity on white brocade.
    The sea is wide and the water deep, let you roam,
    The sky is vast, let you soar,
    Young and strong, arms sturdy,
    The bowstring of the era is yours to draw.

    时代弓弦任你张
    王老九
    北京城里号角响，
    “大办农业”传四方，
    青年同志打头阵，
    百万雄师为粮忙。
    六亿神州山河壮，
    农业战线喜洋洋，
    遍地奔走王保京，
    飞来亿万张秋香。
    川川延河流水长，
    山山宝塔闪金光，
    延安作风威力大，
    地球任你巧梳妆。
    炼就红人红思想，
    坚如鞍山优质钢，
    风吹草动立场稳，
    擒龙伏虎扫豺狼。
    当标兵，作名将，
    青春火花捧手上，
    汗水冲开幸福门，
    白锦缎上绣富强。
    海阔水深任你荡，
    长空万里任你翔，
    年轻力壮臂膀硬，
    时代弓弦任你张。
