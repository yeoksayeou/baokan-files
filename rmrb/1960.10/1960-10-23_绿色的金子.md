“Green Gold”
——Talking about Ghana's Cocoa Zhuge Wen
    In Ghana, cocoa is called "green gold."
    Cocoa is an evergreen small tree, native to tropical regions such as the Amazon River basin in South America. Its growth requires a lot of rainfall and high temperatures. An average annual temperature below 15 degrees Celsius is detrimental to cocoa. Cocoa can bear fruit four or five years after planting, and the main harvest season is from October to March of the following year. The fruits are picked, shelled to remove the beans, fermented, and then dried to become commercial cocoa. Cocoa beans contain starch, fat, protein, and caffeine, are rich in nutrients, have a fragrant taste, and have a stimulating effect. Therefore, it, tea, and coffee are the three major beverages of the modern world. Extracting the fat into cocoa butter can also be used for medicinal purposes. Using cocoa beans as raw materials, high-quality foods such as chocolate can be made.
    Eighty years ago, in 1879, Ghana successfully introduced cocoa cultivation. At that time, British colonists saw that there were huge profits to be made. In 1890, they established a special agency in Ghana, forcing local people to plant it in large quantities. More than 400 million cocoa trees were planted on 160,000 square kilometers of fertile land in the south, producing more than 200,000 to 250,000 tons of cocoa beans annually. The annual output accounts for about one-third of the world's total output, making Ghana the world's largest producer and exporter of cocoa beans. Cocoa exports have become Ghana's main source of foreign exchange, providing about three-fifths of the annual national income. About two-fifths of the country's population depends on cocoa cultivation to maintain their lives. It can be seen how important cocoa is to Ghana's national economy.
    However, "green gold" has not brought wealth and happiness to the people of Ghana, but is a "cash cow" for greedy foreign monopoly capitalists. The colonists, relying on their procurement companies, bought green seedlings at low prices, lent money at usurious rates, and monopolized the right of purchase, reducing the purchase price to the equivalent of 30% to 50% of the world price.
    Ghana's fertile land could have produced abundant grains, oilseeds, cotton, rubber, bananas, and tobacco. Vast natural grasslands could develop animal husbandry. However, the colonialists only allowed the development of a single economy. Every year, Ghana had to spend 30 to 40 million pounds in foreign exchange to import food, textiles, and daily necessities from the colonialists' commercial companies at prices five times higher than world prices, forming a typical colonial economy.
    The colonialists' bone-scraping exploitation could not but arouse the resistance of the Ghanaian people. The Ghanaian people had repeatedly launched struggles against the colonialists' monopoly prices and refusal to sell cocoa, writing a glorious page in the history of national liberation struggle. In March 1957, Ghana broke its colonial shackles and gained national independence. Soon after, it took back the sales rights of cocoa from foreign companies, determined to turn "green gold" into a source for creating a happy and prosperous life.

    “绿色的金子”
    ——谈加纳的可可　诸葛文
    在加纳，可可被称为“绿色的金子”。
    可可是一种常绿小乔木，原产于南美洲亚马孙河流域等热带地区，它的生长需要很多雨量和很高的气温，年平均温度低于摄氏十五度对可可就不利。可可栽植四五年后即可结实，每年十月到次年三月是主要收获季节。果实摘下，破壳取出豆子，使它发酵后再晒干，就成为商品可可，可可豆含有淀粉、脂肪、蛋白质和咖啡茵，养分丰富，味道芬香，而且有兴奋作用，所以它和茶叶、咖啡同是现代世界的三大饮料。将脂肪提炼成可可油，还可作药用，用可可豆作原料，可以制作出巧克力等品质优良的食品。
    八十年前，即1879年，加纳引种可可成功。当时英国殖民者看到有厚利可图，1890年便在加纳设立专门机构，强迫当地人民大量种植。在南部方圆十六万平方公里的肥沃土地上，种植了四亿多株可可树，每年可出产二十至二十五万吨以上的可可豆，年产量占世界总产量三分之一左右，加纳成为世界上出产和输出可可豆最多的国家。输出可可成为加纳外汇的主要来源，每年国民收入约有五分之三是靠输出可可来提供的，在全国约有五分之二人口靠种植可可维持生活，可见可可在加纳国民经济中占着多么重要的地位。
    但是，“绿色的金子”并没有给加纳人民带来富裕和幸福，而是贪婪的外国垄断资本家的“摇钱树”。殖民者依靠他的采购公司，用低价买青苗，放高利贷，垄断了收购权利，把收购价格压低到相当于世界价格的30％到50％。
    在加纳的肥沃土地上，本来就可以盛产粮食、油料、棉花、橡胶、香蕉和烟叶等农产品，广大的天然草地，可发展畜牧业，可是，殖民主义者只准许发展单一经济，每年加纳不得不花费三四千万镑外汇，用高于世界价格五倍的价钱向殖民者的商业公司进口食品、纺织品以及日用品，形成了典型的殖民地经济。
    殖民者敲骨吸髓的盘剥，不能不引起加纳人民的反抗，加纳人民曾经数度掀起反对殖民者垄断价格和拒绝出售可可的斗争，在民族解放斗争史上，写下光辉的一页。1957年3月，加纳挣断殖民枷锁，获得民族独立后不久，就从外国公司手里收回可可的销售权利，决心要把“绿色的金子”变成为创造幸福富裕生活的源泉。
