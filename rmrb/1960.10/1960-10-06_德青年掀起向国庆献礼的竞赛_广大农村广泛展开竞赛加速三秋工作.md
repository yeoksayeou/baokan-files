Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th: A "Compass" competition movement centered on active participation in socialist construction, launched among the broad masses of youth in the German Democratic Republic, has achieved remarkable results. Now, this movement has ended its fourth phase, which began on May 8th this year, the fifteenth anniversary of Germany's liberation. The various levels of the Free German Youth League are summarizing the gains of this movement, preparing them as gifts for the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic (October 7th).

The "Compass" competition began in 1958. The content of this movement is to coordinate with the central work of the Party and the government in various periods, mobilize the broad masses of youth to do their jobs well, actively participate in socialist construction, and do a good job in study, sports, and recreational activities. The young people participating in the competition must write guarantees or initiatives on a chart with a compass drawn on it, as their "compass." For more than two years, more than half of the country's young people have actively participated in this movement. As of September 1, more than 56,000 youth groups have put forward collective "compasses," and more than 739,000 young people have put forward individual "compasses."

The youth "Compass" competition movement has played a clear role in national socialist construction. According to the guarantees written on their "compasses," the young people actively participated in the competition to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team." At present, about 736,000 young people across the country are participating in this competition. Among the production teams participating in the competition, 12,867 teams are entirely composed of young workers. In the course of the competition, the young people continuously put forward rationalization proposals. In the four months from May 1 to September 1 alone, they increased the country's wealth by more than 9.4 million marks.

The "Compass" competition movement has inspired young people to actively participate in the construction of the Seven-Year Plan. By last year, more than 700 construction projects were completely undertaken by young people. These projects were declared "Youth Construction Projects," including some key construction projects of the Seven-Year Plan, airports, sports fields, and so on.

Under the call of the "Compass" competition movement, many young people have also made achievements on the agricultural front. In this year's summer and autumn harvests, more than 260,000 young people volunteered to go to the countryside every weekend to help with the harvest, and more than 45,000 young people guaranteed in their "compasses" to stay in the countryside to participate in agricultural labor in production cooperatives. At present, there are more than 4,600 livestock breeding teams across the country that are entirely composed of young people.

The young people have improved their political awareness in the competition movement. Many advanced people among them have been absorbed into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Free German Youth League. According to statistics, from May to September this year, 16,555 young people have joined the Socialist Unity Party, and 141,624 have joined the Free German Youth League.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: A socialist competition activity to accelerate the autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing is underway on the agricultural front of the German Democratic Republic.

This competition was initiated by the Halle District on September 22. In recent years, it has quickly been responded to by the districts of Cottbus, Leipzig, Schwerin, Rostock, and Suhl.

The challenge conditions put forward by the Halle District are: to complete the harvesting and storage of corn four days ahead of the original plan, to complete the harvest plan for potatoes and sugar beets by the beginning of October, and to complete the state purchase plan for potatoes before the end of October.

This year, the main autumn harvest crops in the German Democratic Republic, such as corn, potatoes, and sugar beets, have generally increased in production. The output of silage corn has increased by 45% compared with last year.

As of the 23rd, the harvest of silage corn nationwide had reached 62.3% of the planted area, and potatoes had reached 25.6%. The competition activities currently being carried out in various districts will enable the autumn harvest and autumn planting work to be completed ahead of schedule.

    德青年掀起向国庆献礼的竞赛
    广大农村广泛展开竞赛加速三秋工作
    新华社柏林5日电　在德意志民主共和国广大青年中开展的以积极参加社会主义建设为中心内容的“指南针”竞赛运动取得了显著成绩。现在，这个运动已经结束它的第四阶段，目前这一阶段的竞赛是从今年5月8日德国解放十五周年开始的。自由德国青年联盟的各级组织正在总结这一运动的收获，准备作为德意志民主共和国成立十一周年（10月7日）的献礼。
    “指南针”竞赛是1958年开始的。这个运动的内容是：配合党和政府在各个时期的中心工作，动员广大青年在自己岗位上做好工作，积极参加社会主义建设，搞好学习和体育文娱活动。参加竞赛的青年们要在一张绘有指南针的图表上写上保证或创议，作为自己的“指南针”。两年多来，占全国一半以上的青年积极地参加了这个运动。截至9月1日为止，已有五万六千多个青年小组提出了集体“指南针”，有七十三万九千多名青年提出了个人“指南针”。
    青年“指南针”竞赛运动在国家社会主义建设中起了明显作用。青年们根据自己在“指南针”上写的保证，积极参加了争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛。目前，全国约有七十三万六千多名青年参加了这个竞赛，在参加竞赛的生产队中，有一万二千八百六十七个队是完全由青年工人组成的。在竞赛过程中，青年们不断提出合理化建议，仅从今年5月1日到9月1日的四个月中，他们就给国家增加了九百四十万马克以上的财富。
    “指南针”竞赛运动鼓舞着青年们积极参加七年计划的建设工程。到去年，就有七百多个建设项目完全由青年负责建设，这些项目被宣布为“青年建设项目”，其中包括七年计划一些重点建设工程和飞机场、运动场等。
    许多青年在“指南针”竞赛运动的号召下，在农业战线上也做出了成绩。在今年夏收和秋收工作中，有二十六万多青年每个周末都志愿下乡帮助收获，还有四万五千多名青年在自己的“指南针”中，保证留在农村参加生产合作社的农业劳动。现在，全国已经有四千六百多个牲畜饲养队完全由青年组成。
    青年们在竞赛运动中提高了政治觉悟，他们中的许多先进人物被吸收加入了德国统一社会党和自由德国青年联盟。据统计，从今年5月到9月，已有一万六千五百五十五名青年参加了统一社会党，有十四万一千六百二十四人加入了自由德国青年联盟。
    新华社柏林电　德意志民主共和国农业战线上正展开一个加速秋收秋种和秋耕的社会主义竞赛活动。
    这个竞赛是哈雷专区在9月22日发起的。几年来，迅速得到科特布斯、来比锡、什未林、罗斯托克和苏尔等专区的响应。
    哈雷专区提出的挑战条件是：较原计划提前四天收完和储藏好玉米，10月上旬完成马铃薯和甜菜的收获计划，10月底以前完成马铃薯的国家收购计划。
    今年，德意志民主共和国的主要秋收作物玉米、马铃薯和甜菜等普遍增产。青贮玉米产量较去年增加了45％。
    截至23日，全国青贮玉米的收获已达到种植面积的62.3％，马铃薯达到25.6％。目前各专区展开的竞赛活动，将使秋收秋种工作提前完成。
