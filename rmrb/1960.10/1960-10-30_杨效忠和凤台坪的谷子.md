    Yang Xiaozhong and the Millet of Fengtaiping
    By Our Correspondent Feng Dongshu
    I had long heard that the millet of Fengtaiping in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, was good. This time, after coming to Fengtaiping and seeing it, it truly lived up to its reputation: there was a lot planted, it grew well, and the ears were heavy.
    According to people from the villages around Fengtaiping, the millet of Fengtaiping was not particularly outstanding in the past, but in recent years it has undergone a great transformation, exhibiting three major special characteristics: First, it has been continuously increasing production from 1950 to the present. In 1950, the yield was 139 jin per mu. Last year, it reached 552 jin per mu. If production increases again this year, it will be a decade of consecutive victories. Second, the millet of Fengtaiping seems to grow well in any land. Whether in the gullies or on the ridges, it grows well wherever it is planted! Third, the ears of millet in Fengtaiping are getting longer every year. Ten years ago, the ears of Dabai millet were six inches long, but now they average nine inches six. In the past, the longest ears were found on the Matuojiang millet, which were nine inches long, but now they average one foot five or six inches.
    Why has the millet of Fengtaiping undergone such a big change? When we discussed this issue with the commune members, they talked about Yang Xiaozhong. Yang Xiaozhong is the secretary of the Party branch here, and everyone calls him "Millet Expert."
    Engaged in experimentation for ten years as if it were a single day
    It turns out that Yang Xiaozhong, as early as ten years ago, established the first privately-run experimental small farm in Wuxiang County, and began his research activities on millet. Ten years ago, Yang Xiaozhong was only twenty-eight years old and was a mutual aid team leader. In July and August of 1949, Yang Xiaozhong led the seven members of his team to weed his millet field. After the weeding was finished, there were not many millet seedlings left. It turned out that the white blight disease was particularly severe in his field, and more than 4,000 diseased plants were pulled out from one mu. Yang Xiaozhong was both anxious and angry: How could this be allowed to continue! At that time, Wei Dan'er was the most experienced farmer in their team, but he couldn't explain the reason. Some of the others said, "Farming is about 'hitting the household,' relying on luck. This year, you're probably out of luck!" Some said: "Since ancient times, growing crops has meant planting on the land and harvesting from the heavens. What else can be done!" Although Yang Xiaozhong had not learned any new agricultural science knowledge at that time, he always felt that what they said didn't make sense. He asked everyone: "If you say it's bad luck, why doesn't the millet field next to this one have white blight? It's all my land! The only difference between these two fields is that one is Dabai millet and the other is Dahuan millet. There is no other difference. Is there a problem with the seeds?" When he mentioned this, everyone thought it made sense, and someone suggested: "Then let's plant some of each kind of millet and experiment, and won't that solve the problem?" Thus, the small farm was born.
    Since the establishment of this small farm, the millet of Fengtaiping has gradually begun to change. Yang Xiaozhong initially just wanted to find a good variety of millet that had high yield and fewer diseases, but one year he discovered that even the superior varieties that had been tested and confirmed had a difference of seventy or eighty jin in yield when planted on two different pieces of land. From this, he realized that it was not enough to just conduct variety trials, but that it was also necessary to "adapt to local conditions." So he divided the small farm into smaller units, setting up an experimental plot in each type of land, such as gully land, slope land, ridge land, sunny land, shady land, and sheltered land, planting all kinds of millet to see which kind of land was best for which kind of millet, and found out the rules for which kind of millet was suitable for which kind of land. After that, he conducted sowing date trials, fertilization trials, cultivation trials, close planting comparison trials, and so on. The number of experimental projects increased, the scope expanded, he became more and more familiar with the characteristics of millet, and more and more familiar with the characteristics of the soil, and the yield of millet increased accordingly.
    Learning science and paying respects to teachers everywhere
    Yang Xiaozhong's continuous experimentation and research brought the millet yield of Fengtaiping to a new level, but there were some problems that he couldn't figure out. For example, why did Dabai millet love to grow white blight the most? Xiaozhong had no way to deal with it.
    Any difficulty, as long as you are determined to overcome it, there is always a way. Yang Xiaozhong was not intimidated by this difficulty, but instead advanced in the face of difficulties, and he began to learn scientific and technical knowledge. At first, he bought some simple books, such as "How Plants Live" and "How to Fertilize," intending to try to see if he could learn them, but once he touched them, he became fascinated, and many old knots were slowly untied when he opened the book. The more problems he solved, the more motivated he became to learn, and people said that he was "simply fascinated by reading." It was really like that. Once, he was walking and reading, and he didn't pay attention and almost fell into a deep ditch.
    Yang Xiaozhong was the leader of the mutual aid team, the director of the agricultural cooperative, and after the establishment of the people's commune, he first served as the director of the management district, and now he is the secretary of the Party branch of the management district. As a leader, where does he have time to study? His method is to squeeze. Once, he went to Jincheng and Pingshun to visit, and in just a few days, before the visit was over, he squeezed out time to read a book of more than two hundred pages, "How to Select Seeds." In his studies, Chen Jinshu, a teacher at Fengtaiping Elementary School, and cadres from the county were all his volunteer teachers. According to Chen Jinshu, once it was already half past eleven at night, and he was already asleep, but Yang Xiaozhong took an article "How to Treat Millet White Blight" to him and studied it for three full hours before Yang Xiaozhong went home to sleep.
    The millet yield of Fengtaiping is increasing year by year, and Yang Xiaozhong has more and more opportunities to go out to exchange experiences, which have also become good opportunities for Yang Xiaozhong to learn. This February, they went to Henan to attend the breeding conference of fourteen northern provinces. At the meeting, they heard that a representative from Henan was very experienced in growing millet, so he took advantage of his rest time to visit him. The first time, they couldn't understand each other, so the second time, he found someone who could translate his words and went again, and they talked for two full hours. After the conversation, he also wanted to "hook up" with him, in case he had any questions to write to ask for advice. "Hooking up" is a good way for him to pay respects to teachers, and now he has fourteen or five "hook up" targets both inside and outside the province.
    Learning has given Yang Xiaozhong new weapons, and many problems that could not be solved in the past have been solved. Take white blight, for example. In the past, he didn't know what was going on, but now he knows that it is caused by germs, and he knows that these germs are very viable and can be transmitted through seeds, fertilizers, and soil. So he first put the Dabai millet, which is most susceptible to this disease, in "solitary confinement" far away, and then from seed treatment, fertilization, all the way to harvest, he took comprehensive control measures, and after three or four years of continuous treatment, the incidence of white blight in Fengtaiping millet dropped from about 30% in the past to the current 1.2%.
    Having technology also requires good leadership
    This is the fact that Yang Xiaozhong has painstakingly researched the growth patterns of millet for ten years. People will ask: Is the continuous bumper harvest of Fengtaiping millet only because Yang Xiaozhong researched technology? "Of course not," the commune members would answer, they said, "The more important reason is that Yang Xiaozhong's leadership is good." Good, first of all, Yang Xiaozhong handles things steadily and thoroughly. Since he started the small farm to study new technologies for growing millet, he has only done one thing that he was not sure about. In 1951, he promoted a part of Bailandesha millet without experimentation, and the result was very poor. Since then, Yang Xiaozhong has never easily promoted anything he is not familiar with, always experimenting first and promoting it after he is sure; and as long as it is an experience that has been confirmed by experimentation, he must promote it. At the beginning of this year, something like this happened: Just as the millet was about to be sown, a large number of black ladybugs were found in the bean field. The production team leaders were so anxious that they asked to postpone the sowing of millet and concentrate their efforts on eliminating the insects. Postponing the sowing of millet has been very common in history here, but according to years of experimentation, it is better to sow early at the right time: first, Fengtaiping is prone to spring drought, and it is not easy to catch the seedlings if it is sown late; second, the climate is cold, and the crops mature late, and it is easy to suffer from early frost. These, the production team leaders are not unaware of, but what to do? Whenever encountering this situation, Yang Xiaozhong always comes up with the safest way, never fighting a battle he is not sure of. He and the management committee members studied it and made a decision: The production team must sow millet on time, and the black ladybugs must also be eliminated at the same time. The method is that the production team will do its best to sow millet, and he and Wei Zengwang, the director of the management district, will be responsible for pest control. At first, people were a little worried, but after just one day, everyone said: "We have to hurry up and sow millet, otherwise we will be left behind by the pest controllers." It turned out that Xiaozhong mobilized everyone who could catch insects, including children and students, and squeezed out everyone who could be squeezed out temporarily, including feeders and cooks, to control the pests.
    Good, also because he is good at mobilizing the masses to overcome various difficulties in production. There are two reasons why he can do this: One is that Yang Xiaozhong has cultivated a group of "tiger generals" since the mutual aid team, they are: Zhang Haiming, Dong Puzi, Wei Gengsheng, Wei Erze, Wei Xiaosheng. These tiger generals are now the captains and deputy captains of the production teams, and they are all Party and Youth League members. Each tiger general has five or six active members whom they call "close-fitting backups." With such a large group of highly conscious and energetic people, what difficulties cannot be overcome, what work cannot be done well! Another reason is Yang Xiaozhong's consistent style of taking the lead in doing practical work. He always goes wherever there is a difficulty, and he can take the lead in doing whatever he says. This June, when the millet was just an inch high and needed to be hoeed for the first time, there was a shortage of labor, and it was clear that timely thinning of the millet was in trouble. After Yang Xiaozhong made the difficulties clear at the commune member meeting, he was the first to sign up to compete with the commune members, and one person had to complete the work of one and a half people. When everyone saw that the Party branch secretary had so much work to do every day and still had to do the work of one and a half people, what else could they say, do it! As a result, the work that was originally said to take seven days to complete was completed in five and a half days.
    In this way, the millet of Fengtaiping became famous and became a model for learning, catching up with, and surpassing in millet production in the entire Jin Southeast Prefecture. Yang Xiaozhong also became famous because of this, and became a special researcher at the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and became a "Millet Expert." However, Yang Xiaozhong never credited the continuous increase in millet production in Fengtaiping to himself. He said: "To be clear about the accounts, what am I? If it weren't for the Communist Party, wouldn't I still be a laborer for the landlords; if it weren't for the county party committee often sending people to help, if it weren't for everyone's support, if it weren't for the Party leading us to realize agricultural cooperation, especially the realization of communization, how could we get to today? Our Fengtaiping millet has today, there are dozens of reasons, the most fundamental one is that our Party's leadership is good." (Attached picture)

    杨效忠和凤台坪的谷子
    本报记者　冯东书
    老早就听说山西武乡县凤台坪的谷子好。这次来到凤台坪一看，果真名不虚传：种得多，长得好，那个穗儿也是沉甸甸的。
    听凤台坪周围各村的人说，凤台坪的谷子过去并不是很出色的，可是近几年却来了个鹞子大翻身，变出个三大特殊来：第一，从1950年起到现在连年增产。1950年每亩产量一百三十九斤，去年一亩就打成了五百五十二斤，今年要是再增产，那就是十年连捷了；第二，凤台坪的谷子好像种在什么地里也能长好。不论沟下还是梁上，种在哪里哪里长得好！第三，凤台坪的谷子，穗儿一年比一年长。大白谷十年前穗长六寸，现在就平均达到了九寸六；过去穗儿最长的马拖缰谷，穗长九寸，现在平均达到了一尺五、六寸。
    凤台坪的谷子为什么会发生这样大的变化呢？我们和社员扯起这个问题，他们就谈起杨效忠的事情来。杨效忠是这儿党支部的书记，大家管叫他“谷子专家”。
    搞试验十年如一日
    原来杨效忠早在十年前，就办起了全武乡县的第一座民办试验小农场，开始了他对谷子的研究活动。十年前，杨效忠才二十八岁，是个互助组组长。1949年的7、8月间，杨效忠领着全组的七个人给自己谷地除草，地锄完了，谷苗也剩下不多了。原来他那块地谷子白发病特别严重，一亩竟拔去了四千多株病株。杨效忠又急又气：这样下去怎么得了！当时他们组里数魏旦儿种地最有经验，但是，他也说不出个道理来。其他几个人有的说“庄稼是‘撞家’，闯的是运气，今年大概是该你倒运了！”有的说：“种庄稼，自古以来就是种在地收在天，还能有什么办法！”杨效忠那时候虽没学过什么新的农业科学知识，可总觉得他们说的这一套没个道理。他问大家：“你说是运气不好吧，为什么紧挨着这块地的那块谷地就没白发病呢？这全是自己的地呀！这两块地除了一个是大白谷，一个是大黄谷，其他条件就再没有什么不同，是不是种子有问题？”他这么一提，大家觉得也有道理，有人就提议说：“那咱们把各种谷子都种一些，试验一下不就解决了？”小农场就这样诞生了。
    自从有了这个小农场以后，凤台坪的谷子就渐渐地开始发生变化了。杨效忠开始不过是想找出一种产量高、病害少的好谷种，但是有一年他发现同样是经过试验肯定了的优种，种在不同的两块地上，产量竟差了七、八十斤。从这件事他体会到光搞品种试验不行，还得“因地制宜”。于是又把小农场化整为零，在沟地、坡地、圪梁地、向阳地、背阴地、背风地等各类土地上，都设上一块试验田，把各种谷子都给种上，看看到底哪块地种哪种谷最好，找出了哪种谷子适合哪种土地的规律。这以后，他又进行了播种期试验，施肥试验，中耕试验，密植对比试验等等。试验的项目越来越多，范围越来越广，对谷子的脾气越摸越熟，对土壤的脾气也越摸越熟，谷子的产量也就随着越来越高。
    学科学到处拜师傅
    杨效忠的不断试验研究，使凤台坪的谷子产量达到了新的水平，但有些问题他怎么也摸不透。就像白发病只有大白谷最爱长，这究竟是为什么呢？效忠就再没有办法了。
    任何困难，只要你决心克服它，总是有办法的。杨效忠没有被这个困难吓倒，而是知难而进，他开始学科学技术知识了。开始他买了些简单的书，像“植物怎样生活”、“怎样施肥”等等，打算试探试探能不能学下去，可是一沾上就入了迷了，多少老疙瘩，打开书一看都慢慢解开了。解决的问题越多，他学习也越上劲，人们说他“看书简直入了迷”。也真是这样，有一次他拿着书边走边看，没留心差点儿摔到大深沟里去。
    互助组时杨效忠是组长，农业社时是主任，人民公社成立以后，他先当管理区主任，现在是管理区党支部书记。担任领导工作，哪有时间学？他的办法是挤。有一回他到晋城、平顺去参观，不几天功夫，参观还没结束，他就挤空把一本二百多页的“怎样选种”看完了。在学习中，凤台坪小学的陈金书老师和县里来的干部都是他的义务教员。据陈金书说，有一次已经半夜十一点，他已经睡了，杨效忠却拿了篇“谷子白发病如何治疗”的文章来找他，整整学了三个钟头，杨效忠才回家睡觉。
    凤台坪谷子产量年年提高，杨效忠出外交流经验的机会越来越多，这也都成了杨效忠学习的好机会。今年2月他们到河南参加北方十四省育种会议，会上听说河南有位代表种谷子上很有经验，他就利用休息时间去拜访，第一次语言不通，第二次找了个能翻译他的话的人再去，整整谈了两个小时。谈完了，他还要把钩挂上，以备有问题去信请教。“挂钩”是他拜师傅的好办法，现在他的挂钩对象省内省外已有十四、五处了。
    学习，使杨效忠有了新的武器，不少过去没法解决的问题得到了解决。还拿白发病来说，过去他不知道怎么回事，现在他知道它是由病菌引起的，而且知道这种病菌生命力很强，能通过种子、肥料、土壤进行传染。于是他首先把最爱生这种病的大白谷种到远处去“关了禁闭”，然后从种子处理、施肥，一直到收获，采取综合治理的办法，进行了连续治疗，如此三、四年，凤台坪谷子白发病的发病率就由过去的30％左右下降到了现在的1.2％。
    有技术还要领导好
    这就是杨效忠十年来苦心钻研谷子生长规律的事实。人们要问：凤台坪的谷子只是因为杨效忠钻研技术才连年丰产的吗？“可不是，”社员们会这样回答，他们说，“更重要的原因是杨效忠的领导好。” 好，首先是杨效忠办事稳当彻底。自从他办小农场研究种植谷子的新技术以来，只作过一次没把握的事。1951年他没有经过试验，就推广了一部分白连沙谷，结果效果很不好。从那以后，杨效忠就再不轻易推广他不熟悉的东西了，总是先试验，有了把握再推广；而且只要是经过试验肯定了的经验，就非要把它推广开去不可。今年开春就发生过这么一件事情：谷子刚要下种，豆子地里却发现了大量黑瓢虫。急得生产队长们纷纷要求推迟种谷，集中力量除虫。迟种谷这里历史上倒是很普遍，但是根据几年来的试验证明，还是适时早种好：一来凤台坪这个地方好发生春旱，种晚了不易捉住苗；二来，气候较寒冷，庄稼成熟晚，容易遭受早霜打。这些，生产队长们也不是不知道，可是怎么办呢？每逢遇这种情况，杨效忠总是怎么保险怎么来，绝不打没把握的仗。他和管理委员们研究了一下，作出了一项决定：谷，生产队一定要按时种好，黑瓢虫也要同时消灭。办法是生产队全力种谷，他和管理区主任魏增旺负责治虫。最初，人们还有点不放心，可是刚过了一天，大家都说：“得赶快种谷，要不就要被治虫的拉在后面了。”原来效忠把一切能捉虫的人，包括小孩、学生都动员出来，把一切能暂时挤出来的人，包括饲养员、炊事员也都挤出来治虫了。
    好，还在于他善于发动群众去克服生产中的各种困难。能作到这一点原因有两个：一个是杨效忠从互助组起就培养了一批“虎将”，他们是：张海明、董朴子、魏更生、魏二则、魏效生。这批虎将现在都是生产队的队长、副队长，都是党、团员。每员虎将又都有那么五、六个他们叫“贴身靠”的积极分子，有了这么一大批觉悟高，干劲足的生龙活虎般的人物，有什么困难不能克服，有什么工作做不好呢！另一个原因是杨效忠带头实干的一贯作风，他总是哪里有困难就到哪里，说到哪里就能带头作到哪里。今年6月正在谷子寸把高要锄头遍的时候，劳力紧张，眼看着谷子适时间苗发生了困难，杨效忠在社员大会上把困难说清楚以后，第一个报名要同社员开展竞赛，一个人要完成一个半人的活。大家一看支部书记每天有那么多工作还要一个人干一个半人的活，那还有什么话说，干！结果原来说七天还完不成的活，五天半就完成了。
    就这样，凤台坪的谷子出了名，成了全晋东南专区在谷子生产上学、赶、超的标兵。杨效忠也因此出了名，成了省农业科学研究院的特约研究员，成了“谷子专家”。可是杨效忠却从不把凤台坪谷子连年增产的功劳记在自己账上，他说：“要把账算清楚，我算个甚，要不是共产党，我还不是个给老财扛活的；要不是县委常派人来帮助，要不是大家支持，要不是党领导咱们实现了农业合作化，特别是实现了公社化，咱那能到今天？咱凤台坪谷子有今天，原因有几十条，最根本的一条，还是咱们党领导的好。”（附图片）
