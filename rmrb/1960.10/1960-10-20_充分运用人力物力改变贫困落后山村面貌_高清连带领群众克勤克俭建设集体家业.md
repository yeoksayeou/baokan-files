Fully Utilize Human and Material Resources to Change the Face of Poor and Backward Mountain Villages
Gao Qinglian Leads the Masses in Diligently and Frugally Building a Collective Family Business

    (Our dispatch) Gao Qinglian, the Party General Branch Secretary of Hongqiangzi Village Brigade in Yixian County, Liaoning Province, has consistently regarded diligence and frugality as a "family heirloom" in leading production, and has finally transformed a poor and backward mountain village into a prosperous and advanced place.
    Gao Qinglian is a Communist Party member from a hired peasant background. When he first led the peasants in establishing cooperatives, Comrade A Yingga, the County Party Secretary, said to him, "Old Gao, the most important thing when cooperatives are first established is to pay attention to diligence and frugality. We should build our family business on these two words. This is our revolutionary heirloom!" Gao Qinglian felt this resonated deeply with him, and he quickly said, "Secretary A, don't worry, I understand this meaning. It won't go wrong!" From then on, Gao Qinglian paid even more attention to diligence and frugality. On the one hand, he led the members to find ways to increase production and find ways to increase the income of the cooperative. On the other hand, he tightened the "gates" and tried to reduce expenses as much as possible, so that all financial and material resources were used to expand reproduction. In this way, he gradually developed the cooperative's family business.
    After the communization, Gao Qinglian served as the Party General Branch Secretary of the brigade. This time the family business was even bigger, and the content of the business increased, with agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery all available. Gao Qinglian worked hard to manage this family business well. Based on the principle of running the commune diligently and frugally, he focused on labor management. He often said: "Improper allocation of labor is the greatest waste." Every time he went to the team to check the work, he had to find out about the attendance of the members, see how the canteen was run, and whether the members had enough rest time, and find ways to make the members eat and sleep well. When members were sick, he would visit them at home so that they could receive timely medical treatment. Some active laborers were often praised and encouraged by him. The attendance rate of the entire brigade has always remained above 90%. Last year alone, more than 100 good members emerged. In addition, he also paid attention to saving expenses. Every time he spent money, he had to carefully calculate to minimize spending and do more things. Once, the commune allocated him 30,000 yuan to buy fodder. Gao Qinglian considered that the livestock feed when running a small cooperative was mainly obtained by cutting green grass himself, and now he could do the same. He planned to save most of this money to expand production. At this time, some team cadres said, "Don't save on one thing to make up for another, why not give us all the money for buying grass?" Gao Qinglian felt that this idea was wrong. At an on-site meeting in the field, he asked the team cadres, "Tell me, is it better to eat an egg or keep it to hatch a chick?" The team cadres said, "Needless to say, eating an egg is gone in a few bites, it's better to hatch a chick!" Gao Qinglian said, "Yes, spending money should also be like this. We must plan for the long term and not spend it all at once!" Then, he told everyone his idea of ​​cutting green grass to feed livestock and save money, and everyone agreed. Later, the team used the saved money to buy three diesel engines.
    In his work, Gao Qinglian realized that: "If the leading cadres themselves are honest and selfless, then promoting diligence and frugality will have appeal." Therefore, he always set an example and set an example for the masses. He often went to the county and province for meetings, and rarely reimbursed other expenses besides travel expenses. His principle when he was away was: if he could stay in a small shop, he would not stay in a hotel, and if he could bring dry food, he would not go to a restaurant. Once, when he went to Jinzhou for a meeting, he saved one yuan of food subsidy and immediately gave it to the accountant when he came back. The accountant said, "This is the public subsidy for you, it's up to you whether you spend it or not." Gao Qinglian said, "No, I went on behalf of the commune, and the remaining money should be handed over to the commune." In life, Gao Qinglian was also very frugal. He didn't pay attention to dressing, and was in the fields all year round. He worked hard and went wherever there were difficulties. He always took the lead in hard work, but he never cared about rewards. Over the years, he has only earned the work points of an ordinary peasant (upper-middle labor force). Some members felt sorry for him and wanted to increase his remuneration several times, but he refused.
    Under Gao Qinglian's influence, the "family heirloom" of running the commune diligently and frugally has taken root in the hearts of the people. This spring, when canteens were set up on a large scale, many teams lacked tables, benches and furniture, and they were all solved by the members themselves, without using a penny of the commune's money. When the brigade established a hoof-trimming workshop, there was no house, so they used waste materials to build a "shed," which has been used until now. In order to save expenses, the brigade's "old car driver" used oil he boiled himself to water the car; when the whipstock was damaged, he used horsehair rope instead. Sometimes when they went to the city to pull things, they brought their own dry food and didn't ask for subsidies. In this way, the non-productive expenditures of the entire brigade have been greatly reduced. For example, the administrative expenses in recent years have not exceeded 0.25% of the total expenditures. However, the expenditure on production has continued to increase. In the past few years alone, various agricultural tools and machinery purchased with the public accumulation fund have been worth about 100,000 yuan.
    Because Gao Qinglian wholeheartedly led the masses to build a collective family business diligently and frugally, he was warmly supported and praised by the masses. In the past ten years, he has been elected as a county and city model worker, a provincial special-class agricultural model worker, and has attended the National Congress of Agricultural Model Workers. He was also elected as a representative of the Provincial People's Congress and a member of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference. In August this year, he was promoted to Secretary of the Secretariat of the Yixian County Party Committee and also served as the First Secretary of the Shijiabaozi Commune Party Committee. Recently, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision calling on rural cadres and party members throughout the province to learn from him. He has become an advanced banner for rural cadres in Liaoning Province. (Attached photo)

    充分运用人力物力改变贫困落后山村面貌
    高清连带领群众克勤克俭建设集体家业
    本报讯　辽宁省义县红墙子村大队党总支书记高清连，在领导生产中，一贯把勤俭当为“传家宝”，终于把一个贫困落后的山村，建设成为一个富裕先进的地方。
    高清连是一个雇农出身的共产党员，在他领导农民刚办起合作社时，县委书记阿英嘎同志曾对他说：“老高，合作社刚办起来，最要紧的是要注意勤俭，应该靠这两个字兴家立业，这可是咱们革命的传家宝啊！”高清连一听，正对自己的心眼，他忙说：“阿书记放心吧，我懂得这个意思，错不了！”从这以后，高清连对勤俭二字更加留心。他一方面领导社员找生产门路，想办法增加社的收入，另方面又紧把“关口”，尽力缩减开支，使一切财力物力都用到扩大再生产上。就这样，一步步地把合作社的家业发展起来了。
    公社化以后，高清连担任了大队的党总支书记。这回家业更大了，而且经营内容增多，农林牧副渔五业俱全。怎样管理好这个家业，高清连费尽了苦心。根据勤俭办社的原则，他着重抓住劳动管理。他常讲：“劳动力支配不当，是最大的浪费。”他下小队检查工作，每次都要了解社员的出勤情况，看看食堂办得怎样，社员的休息时间足不足，想办法让社员吃好睡好。社员有了病，他都到人家家里看望，使他们及时得到医疗。一些劳动积极的人，也常受到他的表扬和鼓励。全大队的出勤率，始终保持在90％以上。去年一年，就涌现一百多名好社员。另外，他还注意节省开支。每花一笔钱都要精打细算，尽量做到少花钱多办事。有一次，公社拨给他三万元买饲草，高清连考虑：办小社时的牲口饲料，主要是靠自己割青草，现在也可以这样做。他计划把这笔钱省下一大半，用来扩大生产。这时候，有的小队干部说：“打油钱就别打醋，买草钱为什么不都交给我们？”高清连觉得这种思想不对头，在一次田间现场会上，他问小队干部：“你们说，是吃一个鸡蛋好呢，还是留着孵一只小鸡好？”小队干部说：“那不用说，吃蛋几口就光了，还是孵小鸡合算呗！”高清连说：“是啊，花钱也应该这样，要往长远打算，不能一下子胡乱花掉！”接着，他把割青草喂牲畜节约资金的想法告诉大家，大家一致赞成。以后队里用省下的钱，买了三台柴油机。
    在工作中，高清连体会到：“领导干部本身廉洁无私，提倡勤俭才有号召力。”因此他处处以身作则，给群众树立榜样。他常到县和省里开会，除了车费，很少报销别的费用。他在外的原则是：能住小店就不住旅馆，能带干粮就不下饭馆。有一次，到锦州市开会，节省了一元伙食补助金，回来马上交给了会计。会计说：“这是公家补助你的，花不花都归你自己。”高清连说：“不，我是代表社去的，花剩下的钱应该交给社。”在生活上，高清连也十分俭朴。他不讲究穿戴，一年四季在田间生产。他做工作不辞辛劳，哪里困难到哪里去。劳动吃苦处处走在头里，可是对报酬却从来没有计较过。这些年，他一直只挣一个普通农民（上中等劳动力）的工分。有些社员过意不去，几次要给他增加报酬，都被他拒绝了。
    在高清连的影响下，勤俭办社的“传家宝”，已经深入人心。今年春天大办食堂，许多小队桌凳家具不足，都是依靠社员解决的，没有动用公社一文钱。大队成立装蹄作坊，没有房子，就利用废旧材料盖了个“偏厦”，一直对付到现在。大队的“车老把”为了节省开支，浇车用的油都是自己熬的；鞭梢使坏了，就用马尾绳代替。他们有时进城拉东西，来去自带干粮，不要补助费。这样，全大队的非生产开支便大大减少。如几年来的行政费的开支，都没有超过总支出的0.25％。但是，在生产上的开支，却不断增长。仅这几年用公积金置买的各种农具、机械，就价值十万元左右。
    由于高清连一心一意领导群众克勤克俭地建设集体家业，受到群众的热烈拥护和赞扬。十年来，他先后当选过县、市劳动模范，省农业特等劳动模范，并出席过全国农业劳动模范代表会议。他还被选为省人民代表大会代表、省政协委员。今年8月，他已被提为中共义县县委书记处书记，并兼任石家堡子公社党委第一书记。最近，中共辽宁省委做出决定，号召全省农村干部、党员向他学习。他成了辽宁省农村干部的一面先进旗帜。（附图片）
