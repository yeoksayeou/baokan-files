Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd: The Japan Teachers' Union, at its extraordinary central committee meeting held in Tokyo today, adopted a current struggle policy, launching a nationwide struggle to smash the Ikeda government's plot to revive militaristic education and undermine the teachers' union's educational and cultural policies.

The policy stipulates that the Japan Teachers' Union will strike on the 15th of this month starting at 11:00 AM, holding rallies in each area based on counties and cities. Before the 15th, each prefecture must hold lectures in at least one location, calling on the people of each prefecture to overcome the education crisis. During October and November, a signature campaign will be launched to oppose the malicious revision of the Basic Law of Education, demand the restoration of the public election system for education committee members, and impeach the Ikeda government's reactionary cultural and educational policies.
