Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Since the beginning of this year, finance and trade departments in various regions have dispatched a large number of cadres and workers to go deep into the front lines of agricultural production, supporting agricultural production, and serving the lives of commune members. This approach has not only more closely integrated circulation, distribution, and consumption with the needs of the countryside, strongly supporting agriculture, but also deeply rooted the work of grassroots finance and trade departments among the masses.

According to incomplete statistics, 150,000 commercial workers in Jiangxi Province have gone to the front lines of agricultural production. In Hebei Province, finance and trade departments have sent 80% of the total number of finance and trade workers in the province to the front lines of agricultural production. From drought resistance, summer harvesting and planting, to the "three autumns" production in Shaanxi Province, finance and trade departments launched five upsurges in support of agriculture, with 160,000 workers going deep into the front lines of production. After these finance and trade workers arrived at the front lines of agricultural production, they generally insisted on eating, living, working, and consulting with the commune members. The forms of activity have their own characteristics. The Fenghuo Commune Central Store in Qianxian County, Shaanxi Province, created a "three-three-four" work system, drawing 30% of its personnel to go down to the production teams to settle down, participate in labor, and combine it with the development of purchasing and sales business; 30% of the personnel deliver goods to the teams, and at the same time use their spare time to participate in labor; 40% of the personnel, in addition to helping nearby production teams with production, mainly do a good job in the purchasing and sales work of the store. According to the local commune members' habit of going to the market, the Chuancheng Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, implemented a "four-three-two-one" work system, that is, on the four days of the market days, the employees of the supply and marketing cooperative do business in the market town; three days going deep into the production teams to participate in production, understanding the production and living needs of the commune members; two days back to the supply and marketing cooperative to hold meetings to study business; and one day taking turns to rest. Many finance and trade departments in various regions have established long-term resident team members in the production teams, who understand the production situation through the resident team members and do a good job in support work. At present, there are more than 13,000 salespersons regularly stationed in teams in Liaoning Province; and more than 800 finance and trade cadres stationed in teams in Yongkang County, Zhejiang Province. Some of these resident team members also concurrently serve as deputy captains of production teams, deputy secretaries of party branches, or deputy captains of cash crop professional teams, and deputy directors of public canteens, according to work needs, which further strengthens the relationship between agriculture and commerce from the organization, strengthens the sense of responsibility of finance and trade workers to support agriculture, and also facilitates better overall arrangement of finance and trade business work. Other resident team members not only undertake tasks such as supply and marketing, and lending and receiving agricultural loans, but also conduct research and technical guidance, becoming the vanguards of finance and trade departments in supporting agriculture.

Combined with a large number of finance and trade workers going to the countryside, many regions have appropriately adjusted commercial outlets according to the needs of agricultural production. Some set up shops in the production teams, some set up field sales departments, and some set up service departments in public canteens. These grassroots comprehensive commercial institutions not only supply materials but also purchase products, and also assist the commune and team leaders in organizing the economic life of the commune members, directly serving agricultural production and the lives of the commune members. Nearly 10,000 commercial personnel in Shanghai have set up more than 1,500 comprehensive stores in suburban production teams. Shanghai, Chuansha, Pudong, Nanhui and other counties have basically achieved that every team has a store. Wuyang County in Henan Province has established 43 field sales departments and 48 work sheds, centered on Fangtian to divide and contract areas. Finance and trade departments in Longchang County, Sichuan Province, have universally established comprehensive service departments in more than 1,000 public canteens throughout the county. These institutions are welcomed by the majority of commune members.

In addition to adding a new force to the agricultural front, a large number of finance and trade cadres and workers going to the countryside, stationed in teams, or establishing stores in teams and fields, have achieved good results in doing a good job in the supply of agricultural production materials, strengthening the purchase of agricultural products, and organizing the economic life of commune members. Many commercial workers in various regions, because of implementing "four togethers" with the commune members, understand the needs of agricultural production more clearly than in the past, and the supply of production materials is done better. After a large number of commercial workers in the Baoding area of Hebei Province went to the countryside, through "three visits" (visiting commune and team cadres, experienced old farmers, and agricultural technicians) and "four calculations" (calculating the autumn harvest task, labor force, material needs, and inventory strength), they learned that there are many late autumn crops and many high-yield crops this year, and the demand for small agricultural tools is large, so they immediately organized commune-run industries to arrange production, and also cleared inventories and adjusted surpluses and shortages throughout the region. Therefore, the supply of small agricultural tools for the "three autumns" was large and timely, strongly supporting agricultural production. The resident cadres of the Fenghuo Commune Central Store in Qianxian County, Shaanxi Province, learned that there was more rain in August and September, and it was the right time to topdress autumn fields after the rain, so they told the store to purchase more than 300,000 jin of chemical fertilizer as early as possible and supply it to each team. After the recent few autumn rains, more than 20,000 mu of autumn fields in the entire commune have all been topdressed. Many store employees who went to the countryside helped the canteens of the production teams develop sideline production locally, made good use of and managed the grain, and established barbershops and bathhouses, arranging the lives of the commune members properly, which many commune members expressed satisfaction with.

    经常下乡常年驻队田头、食堂开设商店
    财贸职工扎根到队服务到田
    新华社9日讯　各地财贸部门今年以来派出大批干部和职工深入农业生产第一线，支援农业生产，为社员生活服务。这一作法既使流通、分配、消费等环节和农村需要更加紧密地结合起来，有力地支援了农业，又使基层财贸部门的工作在群众中深深扎下了根子。
    据不完全的统计，江西全省商业职工已有十五万人开赴农业生产第一线；河北省财贸部门深入农业生产第一线的职工，占全省财贸职工总数的80％；陕西省财贸部门从抗旱、夏收夏种到“三秋”生产，掀起了五次支援农业的高潮，深入生产第一线的职工达十六万人次。这些财贸职工到农业生产第一线以后，一般都坚持和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。活动的方式都各有特点。陕西省乾县烽火公社中心商店创造了“三、三、四”工作制度，抽出30％的人员下放到生产队蹲点落户，参加劳动，结合开展购销业务；30％的人员送货到队，同时利用空闲时间参加劳动；40％的人员除帮助附近生产队搞生产外，主要做好门市部的购销工作。江苏省泗阳县穿城供销部根据当地社员赶集的习惯，实行了“四、三、二、一”工作制，就是在逢集的四天，供销部的职工都在集镇上做买卖；三天深入生产队参加生产，了解社员生产和生活上的需要；两天回供销部开会研究业务；一天轮流休息。许多地区的财贸部门在生产队设立了长期的驻队员，通过驻队员了解生产情况，做好支援工作。目前，辽宁省经常驻队的营业员有一万三千多人；浙江省永康县驻队的财贸干部有八百多人。这些驻队员有的还根据工作需要兼任了生产队副队长、副支书，或经济作物专业队的副队长、公共食堂的副主任等职务，进一步从组织上密切了农商关系，加强了财贸职工支援农业的责任感，同时也便于更好地统筹安排财贸业务工作。其他驻队员既担负供销、收放农贷等任务，又作调查研究、技术指导等工作，成为财贸部门支援农业的尖兵。
    结合大批财贸职工下乡，许多地区根据农业生产需要，适当调整了商业网点。有的把商店设到生产队里，有的设立了田间门市部，有的在公共食堂设立了服务部。这些基层的综合性商业机构，既供应物资又收购产品，还协助社、队领导方面组织社员经济生活，直接为农业生产和社员生活服务。上海市有近万名商业人员到郊区生产队设立了一千五百多个综合商店，上海、川沙、浦东、南汇等县基本上做到了队队有商店。河南省舞阳县以方田为中心划片包干，设立了四十三个田间门市部、四十八个工棚。四川省隆昌县财贸部门在全县一千多个公共食堂普遍设立综合服务部。这些机构都受到广大社员的欢迎。
    大批财贸干部和职工下乡、驻队或深入队、田建立商店，除为农业战线增添了一批生力军外，在做好农业生产资料供应工作、加强农产品收购、组织社员经济生活等方面都收到了良好的效果。许多地区的商业职工由于和社员实行“四同”，对农业生产需要比过去了解得更加清楚，生产资料的供应工作做得更好。河北省保定地区大批商业职工下乡以后，通过“三访”（访问社队干部、有经验的老农和农业技术人员）“四算”（算秋收任务、劳力、物资需要和库存力量），了解到今年晚秋作物多，高产作物多，小型农具需要量大，立即组织社办工业安排生产，又在全区范围内清查库存调剂余缺，因此，供应“三秋”的小农具量多，及时，有力地支援了农业生产。陕西省乾县烽火公社中心商店驻队干部了解到8、9月份雨水较多，秋田雨后追肥正是时候，就告诉商店及早购回了三十多万斤化肥，分别供应给各队。最近几场秋雨过后，全社二万多亩秋田全部施上了追肥。许多商店下乡的职工就地帮助生产队的食堂发展副业生产，用好和管好粮食，建立理发室、澡堂，把社员生活安排得妥妥贴贴，许多社员表示满意。
