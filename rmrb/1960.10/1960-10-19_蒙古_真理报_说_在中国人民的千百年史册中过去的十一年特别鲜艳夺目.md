Mongolia's "Truth Daily" Says
    In the Thousands of Years of History of the Chinese People, the Past Eleven Years Have Been Particularly Bright and Dazzling
    Mongolia's "Truth Daily" wrote in an editorial on October 1, celebrating the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China: In the thousands of years of history of the great Chinese people, the past eleven years have been particularly bright and dazzling. This is a glorious page in the Chinese people's heroic struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong to transform a country that was economically backward by several centuries compared to other countries into a country with modern science and culture. The editorial, after narrating the increasingly astounding achievements made by the heroic Chinese people in socialist construction year after year, pointed out: These achievements of the great Chinese people have made the working people of newly independent Asian and African countries more confident in their future, demonstrating how amazing a cause people who control their own destiny can create.
    The editorial said that the People's Republic of China has waged a resolute struggle against colonialist and imperialist aggressors in order to strive for peace and friendship among all countries, and therefore the People's China has won the love of all progressive humanity around the world who cherish peace. Imperialism disregards the actual situation of the People's Republic of China and illegally cancels China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. However, the editorial pointed out, China is no longer the China of colonial times. No one can fail to recognize that the People's Republic of China is a powerful socialist country that loves peace and has influence in international affairs.
    The editorial concluded by saying that we are celebrating the eleventh anniversary of the Chinese people's historic victory at a time when the friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples in the big family of the socialist camp has entered a new stage of development. The Mongolian people wholeheartedly congratulate our neighboring and fraternal great Chinese people, who share the same goals and cause as us, on achieving even greater successes in socialist construction.

    蒙古“真理报”说
    在中国人民的千百年史册中过去的十一年特别鲜艳夺目
    蒙古“真理报”10月1日在一篇庆祝中华人民共和国成立十一周年的社论中写道：在伟大的中国人民的千百年史册中，过去的十一年特别鲜艳夺目。这是在以毛泽东同志为首的共产党的领导下，中国人民为把经济上比别的国家落后几个世纪的国家改变成为拥有现代化的科学文化的国家而进行英勇斗争的光辉的一页。社论在叙述了英勇的中国人民在社会主义建设中一年比一年取得更加惊人的成就后指出：伟大中国人民的这些成就使新取得独立的亚非国家的劳动人民对自己的未来更加充满信心，表明了掌握自己命运的人民能够创造多么惊人的事业。
    社论说，中华人民共和国为争取各国和平与友谊同殖民主义、帝国主义侵略者进行了坚决的斗争，因此人民中国博得了爱好和平的全世界进步人类的爱戴。帝国主义漠视中华人民共和国的实际情况，非法取消了中国在联合国的合法地位。但是，社论指出，现在中国早已不是殖民地时候的中国了。谁都不能不承认中华人民共和国是一个在国际事务中具有影响的爱好和平的强大的社会主义国家。
    社论最后说，我们是在社会主义阵营大家庭中的蒙中人民的友谊进入了新的发展阶段的时候来庆祝中国人民取得历史性胜利的十一周年的。蒙古人民衷心祝贺同我们具有共同的目标和事业的邻邦、兄弟般的伟大中国人民在社会主义建设中取得更大的成就。
