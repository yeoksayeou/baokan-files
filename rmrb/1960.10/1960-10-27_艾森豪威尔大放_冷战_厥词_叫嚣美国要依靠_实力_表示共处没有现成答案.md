Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch from Washington: U.S. President Eisenhower clamored on the 25th that there were no ready-made answers for how countries with different social systems could coexist, and he emphasized that the United States must "rely on our own strength."

He delivered a speech at Rice University in Houston, Texas, in which he uttered a series of "Cold War" absurdities, slandering the Soviet Union for "not using its great power to improve the world, but as a weapon for political and economic struggle and the enslavement of mankind." He clamored that "there are no ready-made answers to the fundamental question of how to coexist on the same planet with the communist bloc." He said with ulterior motives that "even if all parties in the world have the best intentions, peacefully resolving fundamental problems and differences will still be a complex process." He clamored that the United States must wage a "persistent struggle" in the coming years to realize its policy of aggression and war under the guise of "striving for peace, security, freedom, and justice," and he also advocated that Western countries should "unite effectively" to serve as pawns for American aggression in "newly developed regions."

Talking about the problems of underdeveloped countries, Eisenhower advocated that the United States should intensify its use of these countries' desire for genuine independence to control these countries with "aid." He said, "Underdeveloped countries all have a strong determination to maintain their national independence, and some of them also need to break the shackles of poverty that have plagued them for generations." He emphasized that these countries must "have hope" in the United States, "otherwise, the domestic pressure (in these countries) may become uncontrollable." In this regard, he particularly advocated that "foreign aid" should be used as the "most important" tool for American aggression in underdeveloped countries. He tried his best to prevent underdeveloped countries from taking the path of self-reliance, so as to put them in the shackles of American "aid." He said, "If they (underdeveloped countries) act alone, progress will be extremely slow, but with the help of us and other free countries, they will be able to achieve their goals." Eisenhower emphasized that in underdeveloped regions, "the free world cannot fail, it must win."

    艾森豪威尔大放“冷战”厥词
    叫嚣美国要依靠“实力”表示共处没有现成答案
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔25日叫嚷对于不同社会制度国家如何共处是没有现成答案的，他强调美国必须“依靠我们自己的实力”。
    他在得克萨斯州休斯顿的赖斯学院发表演说时大放“冷战”厥词，诬蔑苏联“不是把它的巨大力量用来改善世界，而是作为政治和经济斗争以及奴役人类的武器”。他叫嚷说，“对于怎样同共产党集团在同一个星球上共处这样一个根本性的问题，是没有现成答案的”。他别有用心地说，“即使世界各个方面都抱有最好的意愿，和平地解决基本的问题和分歧仍将是一个复杂的过程。”他叫嚷美国在今后的年月要为实现它的在“争取和平、安全、自由和正义”的外衣下的侵略和战争政策进行“坚持不懈的斗争”，他并且鼓吹西方国家要“有效地团结起来”，为美国侵略“新开发地区”充当走卒。
    谈到不发达国家的问题，艾森豪威尔鼓吹美国要加紧利用这些国家渴望获得真正独立的要求用“援助”来控制这些国家。他说，“不发达国家全都抱有强烈的决心要保持它们国家的独立，其中某些国家还需要打破世世代代折磨着它们的贫困的枷锁”。他强调必须使这些国家对美国“抱有希望”，“否则（这些国家）国内的压力就可能一发而不可收拾”。他在这方面特别主张要以“对外援助”作为美国侵略不发达国家的“最重要”的工具。他竭力阻挠不发达国家走自力更生的道路，以便把它们套上美“援”的枷锁。他说，“它们（不发达国家）如果单干的话，进步将是极其缓慢的，但是只要有了我们和其他自由国家的帮助它们就能够达到它们的目标”。艾森豪威尔强调说，在不发达地区，“自由世界不能失败，它必须胜利”。
