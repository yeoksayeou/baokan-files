Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The representative of the Togo Youth Action League, Sylvanus Gaba, who is currently visiting China, said here yesterday that they firmly oppose the imperialists using the guise of "aid" to underdeveloped countries and the United Nations to turn African countries that have already gained independence back into colonies. He cited the example of the Congo to expose this new imperialist conspiracy, saying that under the pressure of the vigorous development of the African national independence movement, imperialism had to recognize the independence of the Congo, but it still tried every means possible, through division, intimidation, and "aid," to make the independence of the Congolese people vanish.

Sylvanus Gaba made these remarks when he met with Xinhua News Agency reporters together with Christian Amuzou, an executive member of the Togolese Student Association in France. They pointed out that imperialists may delay national liberation movements, but such behavior will only make the people more clear-sighted. For example, the Belgians wanted to divide the Congo, but the actions of the United Nations in the Congo have made the Congolese people more united.

After describing the struggles of the African people and the Togolese people for national independence, Sylvanus Gaba said that the imperialists are currently engaged in secret conspiracies, attempting to regain control over the defense, diplomacy, and other aspects of some African countries that have already gained independence. "On the one hand, we must strengthen unity and consolidate our independence so that it becomes true independence; on the other hand, we must form a broad united front against imperialism."

In their conversation, Sylvanus Gaba and Christian Amuzou expressed their firm support for the national liberation struggle of the Algerian people. They said that the Algerian people's national liberation war is an important contribution to the cause of the liberation of the African people. Similarly, the victory of the African people's movement for national independence is also an important contribution to the Algerian people. They expressed their belief that the struggle of the Algerian people will surely achieve final victory.

Sylvanus Gaba warmly congratulated the Chinese people on the great achievements they have made in all fields. He said, "Our visit to China has given us the conviction that people liberated from colonial rule are fully capable of building their own country. China's experience is an education and an inspiration to us. China has set an example for the people of colonial countries in striving for national independence and complete liberation." He added that the Chinese people's friendship with the African people has powerfully supported the African people's just struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

Sylvanus Gaba also refuted the imperialists' slander against China's people's communes. He said, "The people's communes are a reliable factor in accelerating China's socialist construction. They have not only liberated the productive forces, but also solved a series of problems such as production, eliminating illiteracy, and liberating women's labor. We have never believed the imperialists' slander against China's people's communes, not even a single word."

    多哥青年行动联盟代表西凡诺斯·加巴发表谈话
    加强团结结成一条广泛的统一战线
    反对帝国主义奴役非洲独立国家阴谋
    新华社6日讯　正在中国访问的多哥青年行动联盟代表西凡诺斯·加巴昨天在这里说，他们坚决反对帝国主义者利用“援助”不发达国家和联合国的名义，来使非洲已经获得独立的国家重新变成殖民地。他援引刚果的例子揭露帝国主义者这一新的阴谋，他说，在非洲民族独立运动蓬勃发展的压力下，帝国主义不得不承认刚果独立，但它仍然想尽一切办法，企图通过分裂、恫吓和“援助”等手段，来使刚果人民的独立化为乌有。
    西凡诺斯·加巴是在和多哥留法学联执委克里斯提安·阿穆祖一起接见新华社记者时说这番话的。他们指出：帝国主义者可能会拖延民族解放运动，但这种行为只能使人民更加擦亮眼睛，例如比利时人想分裂刚果，而联合国在刚果的行为却使刚果人民更加团结起来。
    在叙述了非洲人民以及多哥人民争取民族独立的斗争情况以后，西凡诺斯·加巴说，目前帝国主义者正在暗中进行阴谋活动，企图重新取得它们对一些已经独立的非洲国家的国防、外交等方面的控制权。“我们一方面要加强团结，巩固我们的独立，使其成为真正的独立；另一方面要结成一条广泛的反对帝国主义的统一战线。”
    西凡诺斯·加巴和克里斯提安·阿穆祖在谈话中表示坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争，他们说，阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放战争对非洲人民的解放事业是一个重要的贡献，同样，非洲人民争取民族独立运动的胜利对阿尔及利亚人民也是一个重要贡献。他们表示相信，阿尔及利亚人民的斗争一定会取得最后胜利。
    西凡诺斯·加巴热情地祝贺中国人民在各方面所取得的伟大成就，他说：“在中国的访问使我们得到这样一个信念：从殖民统治下解放出来的人民完全能够建设他们自己的国家。中国的经验对我们是一个教育，也是一种鼓舞，中国为殖民地国家的人民争取民族独立和彻底解放树立了榜样。”他又说，中国人民对非洲人民的友谊有力地支持了非洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的正义斗争。
    西凡诺斯·加巴还驳斥了帝国主义者对中国的人民公社所进行的污蔑，他说：“人民公社是使中国加速社会主义建设的可靠因素，它不仅解放了生产力，而且解决了生产、扫除文盲以及解放妇女劳动力等一系列的问题。我们从来没有相信帝国主义者对中国人民公社的污蔑，一个字也没有相信过。”
