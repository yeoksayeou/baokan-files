Xinhua News Agency, New York, 8th: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the afternoon of the 6th to continue discussing the inclusion of the issue of Chinese representation on the agenda of the General Assembly.

    The head of the Belorussian delegation, Mazurov, spoke first. He supported the Soviet proposal to include the issue of granting the People's Republic of China its legitimate seat in the United Nations on the agenda. Mazurov said that almost every year new countries join the United Nations, but for the People's Republic of China, the United Nations is staging a farce. Mazurov said that those who oppose restoring China's rights in the United Nations have no reason to justify their position. They are resisting the entry of representatives of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations for political reasons. The United States does not recognize that the Chinese people have forever ended the rule of imperialism and feudalism and have forever embarked on the road of socialist development, which precisely illustrates the United States' aggressive and discriminatory policy towards China. The United States fears the voice of the People's China in the United Nations.

    Mazurov emphasized that the absurd policy pursued by the ruling groups of Western countries towards the People's Republic of China is condemned by all progressive mankind. Without the People's China, effective international cooperation cannot be guaranteed; without the People's China, lasting and solid world peace cannot be guaranteed. Without the participation of the People's China, the issue of complete and thorough disarmament cannot be effectively resolved.

    The representative of Ceylon, Corea, pointed out that his country has consistently advocated recognizing the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. He emphasized that it is absurd that some countries that have diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China also voted against restoring China's rights in the United Nations. Corea said that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole representative of the six hundred million Chinese people, and he condemned those who oppose restoring the seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations on the grounds of ideological differences. He also pointed out the necessity of the true Chinese representatives participating in the United Nations disarmament negotiations.

    The head of the Polish delegation, Gomułka, said that due to the obstruction of the United States, the issue of Chinese representation has existed in the United Nations for ten years, which is a shameful thing that undermines the prestige of the United Nations. This issue has paralyzed the United Nations and prevented the resolution of the most pressing international issues.

    Gomułka exposed the US government's intention to fabricate the so-called slander of aggression by the People's Republic of China. He said that the US government does not like China's existing system. This is the real reason why the United States takes a hostile attitude towards the issue of restoring China's representation in the United Nations. The United States does not want the People's China to enter the United Nations because the United States fears that China's entry into the United Nations will hinder the United States from using the United Nations as a tool of its "Cold War" policy.

    The head of the Polish delegation emphasized that the US position violates the UN Charter and prevents the UN from smoothly resolving extremely important international issues, first and foremost the issue of disarmament. Gomułka also condemned Western countries for obstructing the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic into the United Nations.

    Gomułka concluded by saying that the absurd and harmful situation regarding China's representation in the United Nations must be stopped. He said that effectively resolving this issue is of great significance to the United Nations and the cause of peace. Poland advocates immediately granting the People's Republic of China—the sole representative of the great Chinese people—its legitimate seat in the United Nations.

    The Iraqi Foreign Minister, Jawad, said that the issue of the People's Republic of China's representation in the United Nations must be resolved fairly. He said that the fact that the government of such a great country as China still has no representative in the United Nations cannot be considered justified in any way. Jawad emphasized that without the active participation of the People's Republic of China, it is impossible to resolve many important issues, such as the issue of disarmament. He stated that the Iraqi delegation supports the amendment proposed by Nepal to the General Committee's proposal.

    The head of the delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Podgorny, said that for many years the United Nations General Assembly has used a mechanical majority to reject the great People's Republic of China from occupying its legitimate seat in the United Nations. This is to please the United States, at the expense of the United Nations itself. Podgorny pointed out that the policy pursued by the United States towards the People's Republic of China is extremely absurd and foolish. He said that thirty-four countries have recognized China and established diplomatic relations with it, and most countries in the world trade with it. But the United States continues to use troops to support the puppet regime in Taiwan. Podgorny said that the United Nations cannot act effectively in resolving important international issues without the People's Republic of China occupying its legitimate seat in the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council. He hoped that the delegates of all countries in the General Assembly would reject the General Committee's recommendation, namely the US proposal, and support the amendment proposing that the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique be expelled from the United Nations and that the representatives of the government of the People's Republic of China be given seats.

    The head of the Romanian delegation, Gheorghiu-Dej, said that the issue of the representation of the legitimate government of China in the United Nations is a particularly important issue because it concerns the foundation of the United Nations. Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized that one cannot say that the United Nations has universality while denying the founding member and permanent member of the Security Council its representation in the United Nations. He pointed out that it is impossible to resolve international issues, especially the issue of disarmament, without regard to the opinions of the six hundred and fifty million Chinese people. Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that the proposal submitted by the General Committee to the General Assembly regarding the issue of the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is an instruction from the US State Department to some countries that have succumbed to the United States.

    Gheorghiu-Dej recounted the aggressive actions of the US armed forces on the Chinese coast, and he questioned the United States, saying: Since when has a country that defends its own territory become an aggressor, while those who send troops to foreign territories thousands of kilometers away from their own borders are "defending peace"? Gheorghiu-Dej continued, the position taken by the United States towards the People's Republic of China is a blow to the United Nations. The United Nations should expel the US puppets—the Chiang Kai-shek elements—and restore the legitimate rights of the Chinese people in the United Nations.

### 联大会议继续讨论议程问题  哥穆尔卡和乔治乌—德治等要求恢复中国的合法席位

    联大会议继续讨论议程问题
    哥穆尔卡和乔治乌—德治等要求恢复中国的合法席位
    新华社8日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会6日下午举行全体会议，继续讨论把中国代表权问题列入大会议程的问题。
    白俄罗斯代表团团长马祖罗夫首先发言。他支持苏联关于把给予中华人民共和国在联合国合法席位的问题列入议程的建议。马祖罗夫说，差不多每年都有新国家加入联合国，但是对中华人民共和国，联合国却演着一出丑剧。马祖罗夫说，反对恢复中国在联合国的权利的人没有丝毫理由为他们的立场辩解。他们由于政治上的原因而抵制中华人民共和国代表进入联合国。美国不承认中国人民永远结束了帝国主义和封建主义的统治，永远走上了社会主义发展的道路，这一点正好说明美国对中国的侵略和歧视政策。美国害怕人民中国在联合国的声音。
    马祖罗夫着重指出，西方国家的统治集团对中华人民共和国奉行的荒谬的政策，遭到全体进步人类的谴责。没有人民中国就不能保证国际间的有效合作，没有人民中国就不能保证世界的持久的和巩固的和平。没有人民中国的参加，就不能有效地解决全面彻底裁军问题。
    锡兰代表科里亚指出，他的国家一贯主张承认中华人民共和国在联合国的权利。他着重指出，某些同中华人民共和国有外交关系的国家也投票反对恢复中国在联合国的权利，这种作法是十分荒唐的。科里亚说，中华人民共和国政府是六亿中国人民的唯一代表，他谴责那些以意识形态的分歧为理由反对恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的席位的人。他还指出了真正的中国代表参加联合国裁军谈判的必要性。
    波兰代表团团长哥穆尔卡说，由于美国的阻挠，中国代表权问题在联合国中已经存在十年，这是破坏联合国威信的一件可耻的事。这个问题使联合国陷于瘫痪，使最迫切的国际问题得不到解决。
    哥穆尔卡揭露了美国政府捏造所谓中华人民共和国侵略的谰言的用意。他说，美国政府不喜欢中国现存的制度。这就是美国对恢复中国在联合国代表权问题采取敌视态度的真正理由。美国不愿意人民中国进入联合国，因为美国害怕中国进入联合国将妨碍美国把联合国用来作为它的“冷战”政策的工具。
    波兰代表团团长着重指出，美国的这种立场违背联合国宪章，妨碍着联合国顺利解决极重要的国际问题，首先是裁军问题。哥穆尔卡还谴责西方国家阻挠接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国。
    哥穆尔卡最后说，必须制止在中国在联合国代表权问题上的荒谬和有害的情况。他说，有效地解决这个问题，对联合国和和平事业有着巨大的意义。波兰主张立即给予中华人民共和国——伟大中国人民的唯一的代表在联合国的合法席位。
    伊拉克外交部长贾瓦德说，必须公正地解决中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权问题。他说，像中国这样一个伟大国家的政府在联合国里至今仍然没有代表，这个事实无论如何也不能认为是正当的。贾瓦德着重指出，没有中华人民共和国的积极参加，不可能解决许多重要的问题，例如裁军问题。他表示，伊拉克代表团支持尼泊尔对总务委员会的提案提出的修正案。
    乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国代表团团长波德戈尔内说，多年来联合国大会一直利用机械多数拒绝伟大的中华人民共和国在联合国占有合法的席位。这是为了向美国讨好，而损害联合国本身。波德戈尔内指出美国对中华人民共和国所奉行的政策是极为荒唐和愚蠢的。他说，三十四个国家承认了中国，并同它建立了外交关系，世界上大多数的国家同它进行贸易。而美国却继续用军队支持台湾的傀儡政权。波德戈尔内说，中华人民共和国在联合国大会和安全理事会中没有占有合法的席位，联合国就不能在解决重要的国际问题方面有效地行动。他希望，大会各国代表拒绝总务委员会的建议，即美国提案，而支持建议大会讨论关于把蒋介石集团的代表赶出联合国和给予中华人民共和国政府代表席位的修正案。
    罗马尼亚代表团团长乔治乌—德治说，中国合法政府在联合国的代表权问题是一个特别重要的问题，因为它关系着联合国的基础，乔治乌—德治强调指出，不能一方面说联合国具有普遍性，同时又否认这个组织的创始国和安理会的常任理事国在联合国的代表权。他指出，无视六亿五千万中国人民的意见而要想解决国际问题、特别是裁军问题是决不可能的。乔治乌—德治指出，总务委员会向大会提出的关于中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权问题的提案是美国国务院对屈服于美国的一些国家的指令。
    乔治乌—德治追述了美国武装部队在中国沿海的侵略行动，他质问美国说：从什么时候起保卫自己领土的国家成了侵略者，而把军队派遣到距离自己国境数千公里外的别国领土去的倒是“在保卫和平”？乔治乌—德治接着说，美国对中华人民共和国所持的立场是对联合国的一个打击。联合国应当驱逐美国的傀儡——蒋介石分子，恢复中国人民在联合国的合法权利。
