    “These Are Our College Students!”
    – A Record of Harbin Medical University Teachers and Students Going to the Countryside for Autumn Harvest
    By Our Correspondents Yu Zhenying and Chen Zhendong
    While a million people from various cities in Heilongjiang Province are going to the countryside to help with the autumn harvest, our reporters encountered a group of university teachers and students in the rural areas of Suihua County. They acted just like the People's Liberation Army, following the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention." During the day, they worked alongside the commune members to cut crops, harvest sugar beets, and glean grain. In the mornings and evenings, they helped the farmers carry water and sweep the courtyards. After cleaning the landlord's courtyard, they cleaned the streets. After filling the landlord's water tank, they filled the neighbor's water tank. These people were teachers and students from Harbin Medical University, here to participate in the autumn harvest labor. The farmers praised them, saying, "These are our college students!" Ordinary Laborers
    The call from the whole Party and all the people to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production is taking deeper root in the hearts of the people of Heilongjiang Province. Going to the countryside to contribute to the construction of a socialist countryside has become the urgent desire of all teachers and students of Harbin Medical University. On September 21, the school's "Militia Corps" for assisting rural autumn harvest, composed of more than 1,900 teachers and students, got off the train at Suihua Station. Among them were professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, as well as students and staff. However, these people came to the countryside as ordinary laborers, carrying their backpacks. As soon as they arrived in the village, they participated in various rural labor tasks. Pan Jufen, a female teacher from the Department of Microbiology, put down her backpack and saw commune members mixing mud to repair the public dining hall. She rolled up her sleeves and joined in the mud-mixing work. The commune members were very happy, and some farmers even wrote a poem for her, saying: "University teacher goes to the countryside, puts down luggage to mix mud, not afraid of cold water, not afraid of dirt, all for building a big dining hall."
    During their time in Suihua County, the teachers and students of the Medical University not only helped the countryside harvest crops, but more importantly, they brought the work style of the People's Liberation Army to the countryside, which moved the farmers and educated themselves even more. Recently, in all the people's communes in the county where medical university teachers and students were present, many vivid stories could be heard. In the Shuanghe Commune Fugui Management Area, a university student named Cui Bingzhi filled the landlord's water tank with water every morning before fetching water for his neighbors. Over time, the masses were afraid of tiring him out, and some hid their water buckets. Adults and children in this village all knew him. The elderly called him "Our Good Old Cui," and the children called him "Our Big Brother Cui." As soon as they saw Cui Bingzhi, people would rush to invite him to visit their homes. In the Xingfu Commune Hongqi Management Area, the following incident occurred: The landlord, an old woman, went to the fields to work, and her twelve or thirteen-year-old son was sick at home. The old woman told her son not to carry water to avoid aggravating his illness. But when the old woman returned from work, she saw the water tank full and blamed her son for being disobedient. Her son told her with a smile that the medical university student had carried the water. The old woman was very touched and said, "Just like our People's Liberation Army."
    In the past, who had ever seen so many university teachers and students willing to be servants of the masses? But today, in our society, it has become a common occurrence.
    With Farmers, as Close as Flesh and Blood “The Medical University came to our village, touching generations; the old folks smile through tears, the children welcome them at the door. To our village ah, came a group of loved ones!” The broad masses of commune members treated the teachers and students of the Medical University with such warm feelings.
    The broad masses of commune members cared for the teachers and students of the Medical University as if they were their own relatives. They vacated their warm *kang* (a heated brick bed) for the medical university teachers and students to live in; they went to the fields gently in the morning, afraid of waking them up; when the production team leader assigned work, they always tried to give them lighter tasks. In the morning, the old women got up early to boil water for washing faces and kept it warm in the pot; in the evening, they heated the *kang*, made the bed, and felt it with their hands, asking, "Is it cold? Is it hot?" Then they waited for them to return in front of the door. When student Liu Wencheng returned from work, he didn't know who had washed his socks so clean. Later, he found out that it was the landlord's old woman who had washed them. One night, the students living in the Shuanghe Commune Qinjia Management Area were holding a meeting in the cafeteria when it suddenly started raining. The landlord, Grandpa Liu Jiesan, was restless at home, afraid that the rain would soak them, so he took a raincoat and went to the cafeteria to pick them up. Another day, the weather suddenly turned cold, and the members of Team Three of the Xingfu Commune Jianshe Management Area, fearing that the medical university teachers and students would be cold, used their rest time to build a warm wall in their room first. Female student Wang Yuzhi fell ill and stayed at home, where she helped the landlord, Grandma Cui, with needlework. When she recovered and picked up her sickle to cut soybeans, she reached into her pocket and found that Grandma Cui had secretly put a pair of gloves in her pocket, fearing that she would prick her hands when cutting soybeans. This kind of feeling from the working people greatly educated the teachers and students of the Medical University and gave them the most vivid and profound class education lesson. Wang Yuzhi said with emotion, "The masses are too good!" and expressed that she must work hard and strive to work in response to the care of the masses.
    In this way, a deep friendship was established between the teachers and students of Harbin Medical University and the masses, and they took a big step forward on the road of intellectuals becoming working class.
    Better Than Reading for Ten Years
    In the countryside, the teachers and students of the Medical University not only learned a lot of knowledge from the farmers, but more importantly, they deeply realized the great significance of the Party's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link, and felt that the policy of combining education and productive labor was completely correct. Labor enabled them to learn great truths that could not be learned in the classroom. In the soybean fields, we met teaching assistant Tan Jinglan, who was cutting soybeans one stalk at a time. He said to us, "Living in big cities for a long time, away from production, you don't know where grain comes from. For example, if you want to eat sugar, you just go to the store to buy it. By harvesting sugar beets, you realize that even eating a piece of sugar is not that easy. Not to mention spring planting and summer hoeing, but just autumn harvest, you have to first use a plow to turn the sugar beets out of the ground, twist off the leaves, remove the soil, and cut off the fibrous roots before you can load them onto a truck and transport them away. And they have to undergo another process at the factory.”
    Through the autumn harvest, the teachers and students strengthened their love for labor, realized the noble qualities of the working people, gained a concrete understanding of the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, and deeply fell in love with the countryside. Many students said that after graduation, they would come to the countryside to contribute to the construction of a socialist countryside.

    “这才是咱们的大学生” 
    ——记哈尔滨医科大学师生下乡秋收
    本报记者  于振瀛  陈振东
    正在黑龙江省各个城市一百万人下乡帮助农村秋收的时候，记者在绥化县的农村里，遇到一批大学教师和学生。他们就像解放军那样，按照“三大纪律八项注意”行事。他们白天和社员一起割庄稼，收甜菜，拣粮食，早晨和晚上帮助农民挑水、扫院子。把房东家的院子扫干净了，又把大街扫干净，把房东家的水缸挑满了，又把邻家的水缸挑满。这些人是哈尔滨医科大学的教师和学生，到这里来参加秋收劳动的。农民赞扬他们说：“这才是咱们的大学生！”普通的劳动者
    全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的号召，在黑龙江省日益深入人心。到农村去，为建设社会主义农村贡献自己的力量，已成为哈尔滨医科大学全体师生的迫切要求。9月21日，这个学校的一千九百多名师生组成的帮助农村秋收远征“民兵团”，在绥化车站走下火车。他们中间有教授、讲师、助教，也有学生和工作人员，但是这些人是以一个普通劳动者的身份，背着背包来到农村的。一到村里，就参加了农村的各项劳动。微生物科女教师潘菊芬，刚放下背包，看到社员合泥，修缮公共食堂，她就挽起袖子，参加了合泥的工作。社员看了非常高兴，有的农民还为她写了一首诗说：“大学老师下了乡，放下行李合泥浆，不怕水凉不怕脏，为了修建大食堂。”
    医大师生在绥化县的日子里，不仅帮助农村收了庄稼，更重要的是他们把解放军的作风带到了农村，感动了农民，更教育了他们自己。近来，在这个县凡是有医大师生的人民公社里，都可以听到许多生动的故事。在双合公社富贵管理区劳动的大学生，有一个名叫崔炳志的，他每天早晨，先把房东家的水缸挑满了水，然后再给左邻右舍去挑。日子长了，群众怕累着他，有的就把水桶藏起来。这个村子里的大人、小孩都认识他，老年人管他叫：“我们的好老崔”，小孩子管他叫“我们的崔大哥”。只要一看到崔炳志，人们就争着叫他去串门。在兴福公社红旗管理区，还发生这样一件事：房东老大娘到田里劳动去了，她的十二、三岁小儿子正在家养病，老太太嘱咐他的儿子不要挑水，免得累犯了病。可是等老大娘收工回来，看见水缸满满的，她就埋怨儿子太不听话，她儿子笑着告诉她，是医大学生给挑的，老大娘非常感动，说：“真像我们的解放军”。
    在过去，有谁见过这样多的大学教师和学生愿当群众的勤务员？可是今天，在我们的社会里，已成为平常的事情。
    和农民情同骨肉“医大到咱村，感动几代人；老人笑出泪，小孩迎出门。咱们村里啊，来了一伙亲人！”这里的广大社员就是以这样热烈的心情对待医大的师生的。
    广大社员像爱护自己的亲人一样，关心医大师生。他们把自己睡的热炕腾出来，给医大的师生住；早晨轻轻下地，很怕把他们吵醒；生产队长分配活计时，总想要给他们一点轻活干。早晨，老大娘起早把洗脸水烧好，放在锅里暖着；晚上，把炕烧热，把被铺好，用手摸摸，冷不？热不？然后在门前守候他们回来。学生刘文成干活回来，不知是谁把他的袜子洗的干干净净，后来一打听，才知道是房东老大娘给洗的。有一天晚上，住在双河公社秦家管理区的同学正在食堂开会，忽然下起雨来，房东刘杰三老大爷在家里坐立不安，总怕雨淋着他们，便带着雨衣，到食堂去接他们。又有一天，天气一下子变冷，兴福公社建设管理区三队的社员，怕医大的师生们冻着，就利用休息时间，先给他们屋里修上一座暖墙。女同学王玉芝生病了，留在家里，她便帮助房东崔老大娘干针线活。等她病好，拿起镰刀下地割大豆时，一掏兜，才发现不知什么时候，崔老大娘做了一付手套，偷偷放在她兜里，原来崔老大娘怕她割大豆时扎手。老乡们这种劳动人民的感情，大大教育了医大师生，给他们上了一堂最生动、最深刻的阶级教育课。王玉芝感动地说：“群众太好了！”并且表示，一定要好好劳动，努力工作，来回答群众的关怀。
    就这样，哈尔滨医大的师生和群众之间，建立起了深厚的友谊，他们在知识分子劳动化的道路上前进了一大步。
    胜读十年书
    医大师生在农村里，不仅向农民学到了许多知识，更重要的是深深体会到党的以农业为基础，以粮为纲方针的重大意义，感到教育和生产劳动相结合方针的完全正确。劳动使他们学到了在课堂里学不到的大道理。在大豆地里，我们遇见了助教谭静澜，他正在一刀一刀地割大豆。他对我们说：“长期住在大城市里，脱离生产，不知道粮食是怎么来的。比如说想吃糖，就到商店里买来了。通过收获甜菜，才知道就是吃一块糖，也不那么容易。春种夏锄且不说，光是秋收，得先用犁把甜菜从地里翻出来，把缨子拧掉，去了泥土，削掉须根，才能装车运走。到工厂还要加一番工。”
    通过秋收，师生们加强了对劳动的热爱，认识到劳动人民的高贵品质，对人民公社的无比优越性有了具体认识，并深深爱上了农村。有很多学生表示，他们在毕业后要到农村来，为建设社会主义农村发热发光。
