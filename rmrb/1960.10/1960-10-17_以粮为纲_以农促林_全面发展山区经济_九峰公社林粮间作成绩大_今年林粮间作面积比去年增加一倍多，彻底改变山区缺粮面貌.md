Taking Grain as the Key Link, Promoting Forestry with Agriculture, and Comprehensively Developing the Mountainous Economy
    Remarkable Achievements in Forest-Grain Intercropping in the Jiufeng Commune
    This Year's Forest-Grain Intercropping Area More Than Doubled Compared to Last Year, Completely Changing the Grain-Deficient Situation in the Mountainous Area

    (Our dispatch from Guangzhou, 16th) The Jiufeng Commune in Lechang County, Guangdong Province, a well-known forest region, has implemented the policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, practicing agroforestry intercropping, and vigorously engaging in grain production, achieving tremendous success. This year, the commune cultivated and intercropped various coarse grain crops on over 40,000 mu of forest land, which is more than one and a half times the original cultivated land area. Currently, most coarse grain crops have matured.

    The Jiufeng Commune is located in the Wuling Mountains, a high-mountain area rich in timber. Here, there are many mountains and forests but little farmland. The total forest area of the commune is over 930,000 mu (of which over 80,000 mu are suitable for agroforestry intercropping), while cultivated land is only over 29,000 mu. Traditionally, farmers here relied mainly on forestry income, and farmland management was very crude, resulting in low yields. Coupled with only one harvest per year, most of the grain was imported from other areas. Before 1954, over 80,000 dan of grain were imported annually from other areas. In 1957, some paddy fields were converted from single-season to double-season cultivation, and agroforestry intercropping began, resulting in increased grain production, but still over 10,000 dan of grain were imported from other areas. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, thanks to the establishment of people's communes, the superiority of the communes has been fully utilized, and the policy of "taking grain as the key link, combining forestry and agriculture, vigorously developing agroforestry intercropping, adapting to local conditions, and comprehensively developing the mountainous economy" has been resolutely implemented. Not only has it been unnecessary for the state to import grain, but also over 10,000 dan of grain has been exported; in 1959, grain exports reached over 30,000 dan, completely changing the grain-deficient situation of previous years.

    This year, after further implementing the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation" and "vigorously developing agriculture and grain production," the Jiufeng Commune has further clarified the significance of grain production in forest areas. Since the spring plowing season, the commune has intercropped over 20 kinds of crops, such as dry rice, millet, sweet potatoes, corn, sorghum, beans, peanuts, and taro, on young forest land and some mature forest land, totaling 40,040 mu, more than double the largest agroforestry intercropping area in history in 1959. This year, the area of agroforestry intercropping on newly reclaimed land, calculated based on the commune's population of 20,417 people, averages about 2 mu per person.

    In order to do a good job in agroforestry intercropping, the commune party committee first led the masses in summarizing the benefits of practicing forest-agriculture intercropping in recent years: First, fully utilize forest land to rapidly increase grain production. Last year, the Jiufeng Commune intercropped over 26,000 mu of agroforestry land, harvesting 2.35 million jin of coarse grains such as dry rice, sweet potatoes, corn, and millet, increasing the average grain per person in the commune by 115 jin. Second, practicing forest-agriculture intercropping can improve the survival rate of young forests and promote the rapid growth of young forests. Young trees intercropped with agricultural crops generally reach a height of five or six Chinese feet in three years and mature in eight to twelve years; while young forests not intercropped with agricultural crops only grow one to two feet high in three years and take seventeen to twenty years to mature. Third, agroforestry intercropping requires less labor and yields greater harvests. The first year of clearing ridges and burning mountains and intercropping coarse grains generally only requires five or six workdays per mu and can harvest 70 to 80 jin of coarse grains. The second year (i.e., the first year of cultivation), carrying out full plowing and hoeing or semi-plowing and digging holes for planting generally only requires ten to fifteen workdays per mu and can harvest over 100 jin of corn, or over 40 jin of dry rice, or 1,500 to 2,000 jin of sweet potatoes. Through this summary, the masses were filled with confidence and enthusiasm, and launched three upsurges in forest land intercropping, resulting in exceeding the original planned tasks by more than double, reaching 2 mu of intercropped forest land per person.

    To intercrop a large amount of forest land, it is necessary to resolve the contradiction between paddy field production, forestry production, and forest-agriculture intercropping competing for seasons and labor. The Jiufeng Commune this year moved the work of forest land intercropping forward. For example, clearing ridges and burning mountains was completed as early as last winter for 70%-80% of the planned area. Also, the work of hoeing, which was previously carried out after the spring rains, was advanced by one month this year. In this way, the overfulfillment of this year's forest land intercropping task was ensured, while also ensuring the normal progress of other production. In addition to starting early, the Jiufeng Commune also fully utilized the superiority of the people's communes in the unified use of labor, adopting a combination of professional teams and mobilizing the entire population for shock work, to ensure the completion of the expansion task.

    Correctly handling mutual benefit issues is an important link in mobilizing the enthusiasm of production teams to vigorously engage in forest-agriculture intercropping. The Jiufeng Commune fully implemented the "three guarantees" for forest-agriculture intercropping: guarantee labor, guarantee output, and guarantee costs; and promoted quota management, implementing a system of rewards for exceeding production. There are two types of "three guarantees" for forest land intercropping: one is calculating work points based on output, and the other is calculating work points half based on area and half based on output; 60% of the over-production portion that completes the task is awarded to the production team.

### 以粮为纲　以农促林　全面发展山区经济  九峰公社林粮间作成绩大  今年林粮间作面积比去年增加一倍多，彻底改变山区缺粮面貌

    以粮为纲　以农促林　全面发展山区经济
    九峰公社林粮间作成绩大
    今年林粮间作面积比去年增加一倍多，彻底改变山区缺粮面貌
    本报广州16日电　广东省著名林区——乐昌县九峰公社，贯彻大办农业大办粮食的方针，实行农林间种，大搞粮食生产，获得巨大成绩。今年全社在林地开荒间种各种杂粮作物共达四万多亩，比原来耕地面积多一倍半。目前，大部分杂粮作物都已成熟。
    九峰公社位于五岭山脉，是个盛产林木的高山地区，这里山多林多田少，全社林地面积有九十三万多亩（其中适宜农林间种的林地有八万多亩），而耕地却只有二万九千多亩。向来，这里的农民都是以林业收入为主，对农田管理十分粗糙，产量很低，加上一年只有一造，因此大部分粮食靠外地调入。1954年以前，每年从外地调进粮食八万多担。1957年，部分水田进行单造改双造，并且开始实行农林间种，粮食获得增产，但仍然从外地调进粮食一万多担。自从1958年大跃进以来，由于建立了人民公社，充分发挥了公社的优越性，和坚决执行“以粮为纲，林农并举，大搞农林间种，因地制宜，全面发展山区经济”的方针，不仅不需要国家调入粮食，而且还外调了一万多担粮食；1959年，外调粮食达到三万多担，彻底改变了历年来的缺粮面貌。
    今年，九峰公社进一步贯彻“以农业为基础”和“大办农业大办粮食”的方针以后，更加明确了在林区生产粮食的意义。春耕以来，全社在幼林地和部分成林地间种了旱禾、粟类、红薯、玉米、高粱、豆类、花生、芋头等二十多种作物，共四万零四十亩，比历史上农林间种面积最多的1959年，还增加一倍多。今年开荒垦山农林间种的面积，按全社二万零四百一十七人计算，平均每人达到二亩左右。
    为了搞好农林间作，公社党委首先领导群众总结了几年来实行林农间种的好处：第一，充分利用林地迅速增产粮食。去年九峰公社农林间种二万六千多亩，收获了旱禾、红薯、玉米、粟类等杂粮二百三十五万斤，全社平均每人增加了粮食一百一十五斤。第二，实行林农间种，可以提高幼林的成活率和促使幼林快速生长。间种了农作物的幼林树木，一般三年即高达五、六市尺，八年至十二年成材；而没有间种农作物的幼林，三年只长有一至二尺高，要十七年至二十年才能成材。第三，农林间种花工少、收获大。头一年劈岭烧山兼种杂粮，每亩地一般只需五、六个工，可收获杂粮七十斤至八十斤。第二年（即头耕地），进行全垦锄地或者半垦打穴点种，每亩一般也只要十至十五个工，可以收获一百多斤玉米，或四十多斤旱禾谷，或一千五百斤至二千斤的红薯。通过这个总结，群众信心百倍，劲头十足，掀起了三次林地间种的生产高潮，结果超额一倍完成了原订计划任务，达到每人间种林地二亩。
    要大量间种林地，就要解决稻田生产、林业生产与林农间种争季节、争劳力的矛盾。九峰公社今年把林地间种的工作提早来做。例如劈岭烧山，早在去年冬季就完成了计划的70％—80％。又如锄地的工作，过去都是落春雨以后才进行的，而今年锄地工作，就比过去提早了一个月。这样，便保证了今年林地间种任务超额完成，同时还保证其他生产的正常进行。进行大规模的农林间种，除了及早动手之外，九峰公社还充分发挥了人民公社统一使用劳动力的优越性，采取专业队伍与发动全民突击相结合的办法，保证扩种任务的完成。
    正确处理互利问题，是调动包产队大搞农林间种积极性的重要一环。九峰公社对林农间种全面贯彻了“三包”：包工、包产、包成本；推行了定额管理，实行了超产奖励制度。林地间种的“三包”有两种：一种是按产计工分，一种是一半按面积计工分，一半按产量计工分；完成任务的超产部分60％奖给包产队。　　　　　（李超基）（附图片）
