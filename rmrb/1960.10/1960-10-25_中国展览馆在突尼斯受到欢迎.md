Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, October 22nd: Since the opening of the 8th Tunisian International Fair here on the 14th, the Chinese Pavilion has been one of the most popular pavilions at the fair. Thousands of people flock to the Chinese Pavilion every day to visit.

In addition to Tunisians and Algerians, visitors also include guests from far away such as the Republic of Mali, Senegal, Guinea, Dahomey, and the Central African Republic.

Visitors are most interested in, and most impressed by, the great achievements made by the Chinese people in all aspects of the economy during the Great Leap Forward. They are extremely interested in many new products of the Great Leap Forward, such as the "Red Flag" sedan, complete sets of textile factory equipment, and rice transplanters. Many viewers carefully watched the "Red Flag" sedan and praised it highly. They expressed their desire to learn more about the details of the "Red Flag" sedan.

The pictures reflecting the development of the Chinese People's Commune and the agricultural products exhibited in the Chinese Pavilion attracted a large number of viewers. Many people asked how the People's Commune was developed and organized. Visitors who had visited China were particularly interested in this part of the exhibition.

All viewers also praised every Chinese traditional handicraft product on display, such as felt, ivory carvings, and silk fabrics.

In front of the book stall in the Chinese Pavilion, people come every day to request to buy Chairman Mao Zedong's works. One visitor specifically wanted to buy Chairman Mao's "On Protracted War." He said that he had read some of Chairman Mao's works and hoped to read more. A visitor from Dahomey said that Chairman Mao is today's great Marxist and a true Leninist. After visiting the Chinese Pavilion, a family also took a photo in front of Chairman Mao's portrait.

The words written by visitors in the guestbook fully reflect their friendship with the Chinese people and their strong desire to strengthen the friendly relations between Tunisia and China. One viewer said: "After visiting your exhibition hall, I was amazed. I did not expect that the industrialization of New China has reached such a high level. I hope that the economic and political relations between Tunisia and China will develop. I wish the fraternal Chinese people prosperity." Another viewer wrote that the Chinese Pavilion gave the Tunisian people a correct understanding and a satisfactory impression of the great achievements of China's socialist construction. He said, "Let us open our eyes and see our truly peace-loving friends." An Algerian named Muhammad wrote, "You will surely drive the United States out of Taiwan. The United States is talking about 'defending freedom' while supporting colonialism. Its position on the Algerian war proves this. We thank you for supporting the struggle of the Algerian people."

It is estimated that more than 150,000 people have visited the Tunisian International Fair since it opened.

    中国展览馆在突尼斯受到欢迎
    参观的人印象最深的是中国人民在大跃进中取得的伟大成就。中国人民公社发展的图片和农产品吸引了大批观众。在中国馆的书摊前，每天都有人要求购买毛泽东主席的著作。一位达荷美的参观者说：毛主席是真正的马克思主义者。一位突尼斯观众留言：没有料到新中国的工业化已达到这样高的水平。一位阿尔及利亚人写道：我们感谢你们支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。
    新华社突尼斯22日电　自从第八届突尼斯国际博览会14日在这里开幕以来，中国馆一直是博览会中最受人欢迎的展览馆之一。每天成千上万的人都拥到中国馆去参观。
    观众中除了突尼斯、阿尔及利亚人以外还有来自马里共和国、塞内加尔、几内亚、达荷美和中非共和国等远地的客人。
    参观的人对中国馆最感兴趣并且印象最深的，是中国人民在大跃进中所取得的经济各方面的伟大成就。他们对“红旗牌”轿车、纺织厂成套设备和水稻插秧机等许多大跃进的新产品感到极大的兴趣。许多观众仔细观看了“红旗牌”轿车，并且备加赞扬。他们表示希望多了解一些关于“红旗牌”轿车的详细情况。
    反映中国人民公社发展的图片和中国馆中展出的农产品吸引了大批观众。许多人询问了人民公社是怎样发展和组织起来的。曾访问过中国的观众对于这部分展品更是特别感到兴趣。
    所有观众也都赞美展出的每一件中国传统手工艺产品，如毛毡、象牙雕刻、丝织品等。
    在中国馆的书摊前面，每天都有人前往要求购买毛泽东主席的著作。有一位参观者特别要买毛主席的“论持久战”。他说，他已经读过毛主席的一些著作，并希望再读一些。一位达荷美的参观者说，毛主席是今天的伟大的马克思主义者，是真正的列宁主义者。有一家人在参观了中国馆后，还特别在毛主席肖像前面拍了照。
    参观者写在留言簿上的出自他们心里的话充分反映了他们对中国人民的友谊以及加强突尼斯和中国友好关系的强烈愿望。有一位观众说：“参观了你们的展览馆，我为之赞叹不已。我没有料想到新中国的工业化已经达到这样高的水平。我希望突尼斯和中国之间的经济和政治关系得到发展。我祝兄弟的中国人民繁荣昌盛”。另一位观众写道，中国馆使突尼斯人对中国社会主义建设的巨大成就有了正确的了解，得到了令人满意的印象。他说，“让我们睁开我们的眼睛看看我们的真正爱好和平的朋友”。一位名叫穆罕默德的阿尔及利亚人写道，“你们一定会把美国从台湾赶出去。美国一面在谈论什么要‘保卫自由’，同时却在支持殖民主义。它对阿尔及利亚战争的立场就证明了这一点。我们感谢你们支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。”
    据估计，突尼斯国际博览会开幕以来，已有十五万多人参观了博览会。
