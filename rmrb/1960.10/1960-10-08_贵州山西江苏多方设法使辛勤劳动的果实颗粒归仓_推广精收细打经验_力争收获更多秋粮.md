Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 7th: Guizhou Province is comprehensively promoting meticulous harvesting and threshing measures in rice harvesting, such as adding side screens, top covers, and grain collection buckets to threshing drums, striving to bring every grain into the barn.

The threshing drum is the main threshing tool in Guizhou Province. In the past, when threshing rice, farmers were accustomed to using an open threshing drum with four people, resulting in more grain being scattered, and rice straw was rarely re-threshed. Since the rice harvest began this year, leaders at all levels in Guizhou Province have gone deep into the fields, concentrated their efforts on autumn harvesting, and organized cadres, experienced farmers, and youth activists to study various meticulous harvesting and threshing methods. In the Chejiang High-Yield Dam of the Guzhou Commune in Rongjiang County, which was originally considered to be harvested relatively cleanly, an average of six more catties of rice per mu were threshed from the rice straw after re-threshing. These facts made the commune members realize the principle of "every drop makes a river, every grain makes a basket." At the end of September, when the province's rice harvest began to enter a tense stage, the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference to summarize and promote the experience of meticulous harvesting and threshing in various places, and the province immediately launched a meticulous harvesting and threshing campaign. Commune members in many communes have repaired side screens, installed top covers, hung grain collection bags on the front of the threshing drums, and practiced threshing techniques with covers and bags. 70% of the threshing drums in Jinping, Chishui, and other counties have been fitted with side screens. Many communes are re-threshing in conjunction with collecting rice straw, striving to ensure that no grains are scattered, no grain is lost from the drum, and no grain is left in the straw.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th: Commune members in various parts of Shanxi Province are fighting against wind, frost, hail, and other hazards to crops during the autumn harvest, striving to avoid losses of grain. At present, the labor force engaged in rush harvesting throughout the province has increased to more than 1.3 million, and according to recent statistics, more than 15 million mu of various crops have been harvested and brought to the threshing floor.

The climate varies greatly between the north and south of Shanxi Province. During the autumn harvest, some areas are prone to strong winds, early frost, and hail. At the same time, the autumn field area is large, the varieties are complex, and the maturity periods are inconsistent. In order to facilitate quick and good harvesting, communes in various places have ranked the crops according to their type, maturity period, and distance from the plots, and determined the order of harvesting. The autumn harvesting tools, sites, and field paths have also been repaired in a timely manner, and operating procedures and inspection and acceptance systems have been established for harvesting and threshing. Many production teams have assigned special personnel to listen to weather forecasts and have adopted cooperative methods to first harvest low-lying areas and crops that are easily moldy and not resistant to freezing, and then harvest crops that are resistant to freezing in the plains, ensuring that mature crops can be harvested in time before strong winds, frost, and hail arrive.

In the autumn harvest, communes in various places have taken many measures to avoid natural disasters. In the autumn harvest, Shilu County has adopted the method of harvesting tall-stalk crops such as corn and sorghum twice, first harvesting the ears and then digging the stalks. For short-stalk crops such as millet, millet, and buckwheat, the method of harvesting as soon as they are ripe, cutting lightly and placing them lightly, has effectively avoided losses caused by strong winds. After hearing the weather forecast that there would be strong winds on September 19, the secretary of the branch of the Chengguan People's Commune in Lingchuan led the commune members to rush harvest, and harvested more than 20 mu of ripe millet in just three hours, avoiding the invasion of strong winds.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture recently invited commune cadres from different types of regions and major producing areas of different crops, as well as agricultural bureau chiefs and agricultural science institute directors from individual counties, to discuss how to do a good job in the autumn harvest and strive to harvest more grain.

In terms of harvest timing, the representative of Dagang Commune in Yancheng County introduced their experience in rush-harvesting rice: "Harvest the standing rice first when it's windy, rush to harvest the rice that has fallen to the ground in the rain, and finally harvest the bent stalks." This avoids losses from grain falling and sprouting due to wind and rain. Sweet potatoes should be harvested before the frost. The representative from Lianshui County said: Harvesting before the frost has many benefits, it is easy to slice and dry, and only needs two or three sunny days to dry; after the frost, it will not dry even after four or five days of drying. Early harvesting avoids frost damage, and storage is also easy. Beans should especially emphasize harvesting at nine or ten percent maturity. The representative from Guanyun County said: Beans are prone to pod bursting, it is better to burst on the threshing floor than in the field. The representative of Bawang Commune in Suqian County introduced the experience of harvesting sweet potatoes and digging peanuts.

The rice threshing link has the greatest potential. In this regard, the threshing tools used in various places are different, and the experiences introduced are also different. The representative from Yancheng County introduced the method of threshing with a stone roller: Transport the rice bundles to the field, spread them out, flatten them, roll frequently, turn frequently, turn thoroughly, and roll thoroughly. The rice straw should be beaten like hemp silk to achieve the requirement that the rice does not stick to the straw and the straw does not leave rice. The representative from Changshu County introduced the experience of threshing with a thresher: the rice bundles should be small and neat, grasp tightly and spread out, clear section by section from top to tip, and the core rice bundles should be turned over and re-threshed. Representatives from Guanyun and Lianshui counties also introduced the threshing experience of beans and corn.

From harvesting to warehousing management, many representatives in the discussion emphasized that inspections should be strengthened at any time, whether there are any omissions in the fields or on the roads; the field should not be left unattended, and designated personnel should be responsible for ensuring that it is thoroughly cleaned, piled up well, and preventing poultry and livestock from ruining it; pay close attention to weather forecasts, make preparations for wind and rain, and check at any time to discover problems and study solutions at any time.

    贵州山西江苏多方设法使辛勤劳动的果实颗粒归仓
    推广精收细打经验　力争收获更多秋粮
    新华社贵阳7日电　贵州省在水稻收获中，全面推广挞斗加围席、加顶篷、接谷桶加兜的精收细打措施，力争粮食颗粒归仓。
    挞斗是贵州省目前主要的脱粒工具。以往打谷子时，农民习惯四个人使用一个敞开的挞斗，谷粒抛撒较多，复打稻草过去就更少了。今年水稻开镰以来，贵州省各级领导深入田间，集中力量抓秋收，组织干部、老农、青年积极分子，研究各种精收细打方法。榕江县古州公社车江丰产坝，原被认为收得比较干净的，但稻草经过复打后，平均每亩还打出谷子六斤。这些事实使社员们认识到“滴水成河、颗米成箩”的道理。9月底，在全省水稻收获开始进入紧张阶段时，中共贵州省委召开了电话会议，总结并推广各地精收细打的经验，全省立即展开精收细打运动。许多公社的社员们纷纷修补围席、安装顶篷、在挞斗正面挂上接谷兜、练习挞斗加篷加兜的脱粒技术。锦屏、赤水等县70％的挞斗都装上了围席。许多公社结合收藏稻草，进行复打，力争做到打不撒粒、斗不掉粮、草不见谷。
    新华社太原7日电　山西省各地人民公社社员在秋收中和危害庄稼的风、霜、雹等作斗争，力争粮食避免损失。目前，全省投入抢收的劳力增加到一百三十多万，据最近统计，已收割登场的各种庄稼达一千五百多万亩。
    山西省南北气候差异很大。秋收期间有些地区往往容易出现大风、早霜和降冰雹，同时，秋田面积大，品种复杂，成熟期不一致。为了便于快收收好，各地人民公社都根据作物的种类，成熟期和地块的远近，进行了排队，确定了收割次序。对秋收工具、场地和田间小道也及时进行整修，并制定了收割、打场的操作规程和检查验收制度。许多生产队都设有专人收听气象预报，并采取互相协作的办法，先收低洼地和容易霉烂和不耐冻的作物，后收平川地和抗冻作物，保证成熟的庄稼都能及时地在大风、霜冻、冰雹未来之前割完。
    在秋收中，各地人民公社采取许多措施避免自然灾害。石楼县在秋收中对玉茭、高粱等高秆作物采取了收两遍，先收穗后刨秆的办法，对谷子、糜子、莜荞麦等低秆作物采取了随熟随割，轻割轻放，有效地避免了因大风造成的损失。陵川城关人民公社从气象预报中听到9月19日有大风的消息后，支部书记带领社员突击抢收，仅三个小时就收割了二十多亩黄熟的谷子，避免了大风的侵袭。
    据新华社南京讯　江苏省农业厅最近邀请不同类型地区和不同作物主要产区的公社干部和个别县的农业局长、农业科学研究所所长，就搞好秋收、力争多收一些粮食的问题进行了座谈。
    在收获时机方面，盐城县大冈公社代表介绍了他们抢收水稻的经验：“刮风先收站稻，下雨抢收着地倒，最后收好弯弓腰”，这样就避免了刮风下雨掉粒出芽的损失。红薯要在霜降前收。涟水县来的代表说：霜降前收好处多，切片容易晒干，只需晒两三个晴天；霜降后收四、五天也晒不透。早收不受冻害，窖藏也容易。豆子要特别强调九成熟、十成收。灌云县代表说：豆子容易炸荚，宁在场上炸不在田里炸。宿迁县霸王公社代表介绍了收红薯和刨花生的经验。
    水稻脱粒这一环潜力最大。在这方面，各地所使用的脱粒工具不同，介绍的经验也各有特点。盐城县来的代表介绍了用磙子脱粒的办法：稻把运到场，撒开、铺平、勤磙、勤翻、翻透、磙透。稻草要打得像麻丝，才能达到稻不粘草、草不留稻的要求。常熟县代表介绍脱粒机脱粒的经验是：稻把要小、要齐、抓紧摊开，由顶到梢段段清，夹心稻把要翻开复脱。灌云和涟水两县代表还介绍了豆子、玉米的脱粒经验。
    从收割到入仓的管理，座谈中许多代表都强调要随时加强检查，田里、路上有无遗漏；场头不离人，指定专人负责，做到打净、堆好，防止禽畜糟蹋；严密注意天气预报，做好防风防雨的准备，随时检查发现问题，随时研究解决。
