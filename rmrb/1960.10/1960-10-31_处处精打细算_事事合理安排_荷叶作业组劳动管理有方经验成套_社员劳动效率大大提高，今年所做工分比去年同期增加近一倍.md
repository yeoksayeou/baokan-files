(Our dispatch from Changsha, October 30th) The Heye Production Team of the Heye Brigade of the Qingcao Commune in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, has greatly increased the labor work points earned by its members this year, nearly doubling those of the same period last year, thanks to its excellent labor allocation.

The Heye Production Team has twenty-two able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers, equivalent to 12.2 full-time labor units. It cultivates 148 mu of land (including 8 mu of dry land), averaging 12.1 mu per full-time labor unit. Facing the situation of having more land and fewer laborers, this production team, in addition to strengthening political and ideological work, paid special attention to using labor, calculating carefully in every aspect and arranging everything rationally, thereby greatly improving labor utilization.

This production team has relatively mature experience in labor usage and management, mainly in the following aspects:

First, assigning people according to tasks and assigning tasks according to people. Matching the type of farm work with the required skills, and matching the type of labor with the suitable work, deploying them appropriately. This has a very significant effect on giving play to each member's strengths and improving work efficiency and quality. For example, member Hu Chunxian has good production skills but is not physically strong. Last year, he was not assigned work according to his strengths, and only earned more than 1,300 work points in a year. This year, he was assigned to specialize in plowing, harrowing, sowing seeds, and transplanting seedlings, all technically demanding tasks. He often earned more than fourteen or fifteen work points a day. So far, he has earned more than 3,000 work points, more than double that of last year. Another example is member Zhang Tingfa, who is young and strong but lacks production skills. Last year, he was assigned to do more manual work, and only earned 2,200 work points for the whole year. This year, he was assigned to do more physically demanding work, and he can earn more than twenty work points a day, equivalent to two full-time laborers. So far, he has earned more than 3,900 work points, exceeding 80% of his total work points for last year. There are ten laborers in the team with particularly strong skills or physical strength, and it is estimated that they can earn more than 12,000 additional work points this year.

Second, when arranging farm work, implement fixed quotas for the labor required for each task. When assigning work, first calculate the labor required to complete each task, and then assign appropriate labor to do it, which can avoid idling and waste. For example, after the "Double Rush" (summer harvest and planting), the whole team had to wash more than 100 pieces of large and small farm tools. Last year, it took four people four days. This year, with the same number of tools, two people were assigned, and it was completed in three days.

Third, give full play to the role of auxiliary labor. In the past, the team had seven elderly people and eight primary school students who rarely participated in production. Through reasonable arrangements, primary school students were allowed to accumulate fertilizer and watch cattle in the morning and evening, and the elderly were allowed to do some transplanting, harvesting, drying grain, sorting rice, or some chores within their capabilities in life and welfare. Since the beginning of this year, these auxiliary laborers have earned about 14,000 work points in total, equivalent to seven laborers.

Fourth, reform unreasonable operating systems. Some farm work that could have been completed in one procedure in the past was divided into several procedures. Now, combining them can greatly save labor. For example, weeding in the fields, which was usually done by specially assigned labor in the past, twice a year, cost three to four work points per mu of land. This year, weeding and intertillage are combined, saving more than 420 work points. In addition, make full use of labor time and the time spent going to and from work, and arrange farm work that can be done along the way. For example, when plowing the fields, the cattle have to rest three to four times a day, and the team members who use the cattle take advantage of this gap to dig field corners and build harrows, earning at least two more work points a day. There are many things to carry in and out of agricultural production, which takes a lot of labor. This year, they proposed the method of "carrying a load of manure out and a load of grass in," and just the household manure sent to the fields amounted to more than 4,000 loads, and more than 5,000 loads of turf were brought back. During the "Double Rush," more than 500 loads of rice and straw were brought back. Counting these major items alone saved more than 500 workdays. They also make full use of rainy days to combine agricultural and sideline production. For example, sideline production such as loosening field ropes and hoeing field ridges in spring, intertillage and weeding in summer, reclaiming wasteland and digging rice stubble in autumn, and repairing farm tools in winter are arranged to be done on rainy days, making full use of the rainy days.

Fifth, do the work at the crucial points, which can not only improve work efficiency but also improve quality. Agricultural production is closely related to natural conditions, and the amount of labor spent on many tasks varies significantly depending on whether they are done early or late due to the influence of natural conditions. For example, for rice intertillage, last year they generally did the first intertillage half a month after transplanting, and the second and third intertillage were spaced ten days apart. As a result, the mud was hard and there were many weeds, and each mu of rice field averaged two workdays of intertillage. This year, the first intertillage was done seven days after transplanting, and the second and third intertillage were spaced only seven or eight days apart. As a result, the work efficiency was high and the quality was good, and each mu of rice field only cost about one and a half workdays. Weeding and vine turning for sweet potatoes should be done on sunny days, and one mu of sweet potatoes only requires ten work points; if it is done after rain, the sweet potato vines are covered with small roots on the ground, and the same area requires two to three workdays or more.

Although some tasks are not severely affected by natural conditions, they have a strong seasonality, and whether they are done in a timely manner or not seriously affects labor efficiency and quality.

Finally, this production team has conscientiously implemented the Party's instruction on combining work and rest, and the members' enthusiasm is getting higher and higher. They mobilized the masses to discuss and formulate a practical system of combining work and rest.

    处处精打细算　事事合理安排
    荷叶作业组劳动管理有方经验成套
    社员劳动效率大大提高，今年所做工分比去年同期增加近一倍
    本报长沙30日电　湖南浏阳县城郊公社青草大队荷叶生产队荷叶作业组，由于劳力安排得好，今年社员做的劳动工分比去年同期增加近一倍。
    荷叶作业组男女全、半劳力二十二个，折合十分底分劳动力为十二点二个。耕地面积一百四十八亩
  （其中旱土八亩），每十分底分平均负担十二点一亩。在田多劳力少的情况下，这个作业组除了加强政治思想工作外，特别注意在使用劳力上，处处精打细算，事事合理安排，因而大大地提高了劳动利用率。
    这个作业组在劳力的使用和管理上，有了比较成熟的经验。主要有以下几点：
    第一，看事派人和看人派事。什么样的农活，需要什么样的技术；什么样的劳力适合做什么工夫，恰如其分地调配使用。这对发挥每个社员的特长和提高工效与质量，效果都很显著。如社员胡春先，生产技术好，但体力不强，去年没注意按特长派工夫，一年只作了一千三百多个工分。今年安排他专门搞扶犁掌耙、撒子育秧及插秧扯秧等技术性较强的工夫，经常一天作到十四、五分以上，到目前止，他已作工分三千多分，超过去年的一倍。又如社员张听法，年轻力壮，但缺少生产技术，去年安排他作手头工夫多，全年只作了二千二百工分。今年安排他多做体力强的工夫，一天可做二十多个工分，顶得上两个全劳力，目前已作了三千九百多分，超过去年全年工分数的80％。全组像这样有技术或体力特别强的劳力共十个，预计今年可多做工分一万二千多分。
    第二，在安排农活时，对每项农活需要的劳动量实行定员定额。在排工中，要先算出完成每项农活所需的劳动量，再分派适当劳力去作，这样可以避免窝工浪费现象。如“双抢”后全组油洗大小农具一百多件，去年安排四个人，搞了四天，今年同样多的农具，安排二个人，三天就完成了。
    第三，充分发挥辅助劳力的作用。过去，全组有七个老人和八个小学生很少参加生产，通过合理安排，让小学生利用早晚积肥看牛，老年人作些扯秧、割禾、晒谷、整米或生活福利上一些力所能及的事情，今年以来，这些辅助劳力共作工分一万四千分左右，相当七个劳动力。
    第四，改革不合理的操作制度。有些农活本来一道工序就可以完成的，过去分成了几道工序，现在合起来就可大大节约劳力。如田间除稗，过去通常是专门安排劳力除稗，一年除两次，每亩田花工三至四分，今年把除稗与中耕合并进行，即节省了四百二十多个工分。另外，充分利用劳动时间和出工收工走路的时间，安排可以稍带作完的农活。如耕田，一天之中牛要歇三至四次，用牛的社员便利用这个空隙挖田角、搭耙头，一天至少可多作工分二分左右。农业生产上挑进挑出的东西很多，花工不少，他们今年提出“出门一担粪，进门一担草”的办法，光出工收工送到田间的家粪便有四千多担，带回的草皮五千多担，“双抢”中带回稻谷、稻草五百多担，算这几大项即省工五百多个。他们还充分利用雨天，把农副业生产结合起来。如春季放田索、铲田塍、夏季中耕除稗、秋季开荒、挖禾兜，冬季整修农具等副业生产，安排在雨天做，把雨天利用起来了。
    第五，把工夫做在骨节眼上，既能提高工效，又能提高质量。农业生产与自然条件密切相关，许多工夫由于自然条件的影响，早做迟做所花费的劳动量有显著的差别。如水稻中耕，去年他们一般在插秧后半个月才?头道，二、三道中耕时间相隔十天，结果泥巴硬，草多，每亩水稻平均花?田工二个。今年插秧七天后?头道，二、三道之间也只隔七、八天，结果工效高，质量好，每亩田只花工一个半左右。红薯锄草翻藤，抢晴天作，一亩薯只需工十来分；如雨后去作，薯藤在地面上布满了小根，同样一亩面积，要花工两至三个以上。
    有些工夫虽然不受自然条件的严重影响，但有着强烈的季节性，做得及时与不及时，严重影响劳动工效与质量。
    最后，这个作业组认真贯彻了党的劳逸结合的指示，社员干劲越干越足。他们发动群众讨论，制订了切实可行的劳逸结合的制度。
