    Welcome Algerian Guests of Honor, Heroes
    Welcome, welcome our beloved fighting brothers!
    Welcome, welcome heroic Algerian guests!
    You bring fiery friendship from fiery lands.
    We warmly welcome you – with burning hearts!
    The waves of the western Mediterranean surge and swell.
    The blood of the people on the south shore has long been boiling.
    For six years you have persisted in your righteous armed struggle,
    Six hundred million Chinese admire you and support you.
    We must not harbor any illusions about the imperialist jackals:
    This is our own painful experience of more than a hundred years.
    We must meet the colonialist robbers with blade to blade, gun to gun,
    Not fearing their intimidation, nor being deceived by them!
    Only the land conquered by the people themselves can be firmly and well seated.
    You are undergoing trials of fire and baptisms of blood.
    The doomsday fate of the colonialists cannot be saved,
    Even if they suppress and slaughter, using medieval beheading machines.
    Crush the so-called "natural barrier" of the "Morice Line"!
    Heroic National Liberation Army, forward! forward! forward!
    Strive to seize more and greater initiative on the battlefield!
    Plant the flag of victory all over Algeria!
    You have brought the ardent goodwill of the fiery land,
    Please take back the burning affection of 650 million people!
    Although geographically we are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers,
    Spiritually we are forever, forever, heart to heart!

    欢迎英雄的阿尔及利亚贵宾
    萧三欢迎，欢迎我们敬爱的战斗的兄弟！欢迎，欢迎英雄的阿尔及利亚贵宾！你们从火热的土地带来了火热的友谊。我们热烈地欢迎——怀着火热的心情！地中海西部的波涛澎湃汹涌。海南岸人民的热血早已沸腾。六个年头你们坚持正义的武装斗争，六亿多中国人敬佩你们，支持你们。对帝国主义豺狼不能存任何幻想：这是我们一百多年来的切身经验。对殖民主义强盗必须刀对刀、枪对枪，不怕他们的威吓，不受他们的欺骗！人民自己打下的江山才能坐稳、坐好。你们在经受着火的锻炼，血的洗礼。殖民主义者末日的命运挽救不了，尽管他镇压、屠杀，用中世纪的断头机器。冲垮“莫里斯防线”的什么“天险”！英雄的民族解放军，前进！前进！前进！努力掌握战场上更多更大的主动权！把胜利的旗帜插遍阿尔及利亚全境！你们带来了火热土地火热的盛意，请带回去六亿五千万人火热的深情！地理上我们虽然相隔千山万水，精神上我们永远、永远心连着心！欢迎，欢迎我们敬爱的战斗的兄弟！欢迎，欢迎英雄的阿尔及利亚贵宾！你们从火热的土地带来了火热的友谊。我们热烈地欢迎——怀着火热的心情！地中海西部的波涛澎湃汹涌。海南岸人民的热血早已沸腾。六个年头你们坚持正义的武装斗争，六亿多中国人敬佩你们，支持你们。对帝国主义豺狼不能存任何幻想：这是我们一百多年来的切身经验。对殖民主义强盗必须刀对刀、枪对枪，不怕他们的威吓，不受他们的欺骗！人民自己打下的江山才能坐稳、坐好。你们在经受着火的锻炼，血的洗礼。殖民主义者末日的命运挽救不了，尽管他镇压、屠杀，用中世纪的断头机器。冲垮“莫里斯防线”的什么“天险”！英雄的民族解放军，前进！前进！前进！努力掌握战场上更多更大的主动权！把胜利的旗帜插遍阿尔及利亚全境！你们带来了火热土地火热的盛意，请带回去六亿五千万人火热的深情！地理上我们虽然相隔千山万水，精神上我们永远、永远心连着心！
