Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th -- A grand report meeting was held in Pyongyang tonight with more than two thousand people from all walks of life to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into Korea to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

On the center of the rostrum were the national flags of Korea and China and huge portraits of Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong.

Premier Kim Il-sung of the Korean Cabinet attended the meeting. Also participating were Choi Yong-kun, Kim Il, Hong Myung-hui, Park Jung-ae, Park Kum-chul, Kim Chang-man, Jung Il-ryong, Nam Il, Lim Hae, Ha Ang-cheon, Kim Ik-sun, Jung Joon-taek, Lee Joo-yeon and other Korean party and government leaders. Also attending were cabinet ministers, chairmen of the Presidium of the Fatherland Front, leading cadres of various social organizations, and senior generals of the Korean People's Army.

The Military Friendship Delegation of the People's Republic of China, led by Marshal He Long, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council and Vice Premier of the State Council, and General Luo Ruiqing, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as Qiao Xiaoguang, Chinese Ambassador to Korea, and all diplomatic officials of the embassy, were invited to attend the meeting. Diplomatic envoys, diplomats, and military attachés from various countries to Korea also participated.

When Premier Kim Il-sung, Chairman Choi Yong-kun, and other Korean party and government leaders, along with the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation, ascended the rostrum, the entire venue erupted in warm cheers and applause lasting more than ten minutes.

After Jung Il-ryong, Vice Premier of the Korean Cabinet and Chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee, delivered the opening speech, General Kim Kwang-hyup, Vice Premier of the Korean Cabinet and Minister of National Defence, delivered a lengthy report.

In his report, Kim Kwang-hyup first, on behalf of the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, and the entire Korean people, extended the highest respect and honor to the heroic sons and daughters of the Chinese people who sacrificed themselves in the righteous common struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, and expressed heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the entire Chinese people, and the officers and soldiers of the former Chinese People's Volunteers who aided the Korean people with their blood. He also expressed a warm welcome on behalf of the entire Korean people and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army to the distinguished guests from the most intimate neighboring country – the Military Friendship Delegation of the People's Republic of China headed by Comrade He Long and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Art Troupe.

Kim Kwang-hyup said that ten years ago, in our most difficult period of opposing the armed aggression of U.S. imperialism and its puppet states, the Chinese people's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers infinitely inspired our people and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army who were blocking the enemy's frantic attacks and effectively preparing for a renewed counter-offensive. Although U.S. imperialism threw enormous forces and modern weapons into the Korean front and exhausted all barbaric means, it repeatedly suffered shameful and disastrous defeats in the face of the heroic struggle and united power of the people's armies of Korea and China, and finally had to sign the armistice agreement.

He said that in the Korean War, the unity and friendship between the people and armies of Korea and China became a living example of proletarian internationalism, which will be forever recorded in the annals of progressive mankind.

Kim Kwang-hyup said that the people and armies of Korea and China, with the support and solidarity of the people of fraternal countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world, defeated the U.S. imperialist aggressors, thereby thwarting the U.S. imperialist's sinister aggressive conspiracy to seize all of Korea and expand the flames of war against the socialist camp, and made a great contribution to the great cause of peace in the Far East and the world. The historic victory achieved by the people and armies of Korea and China in the Korean War demonstrated the indestructible power of the awakened Eastern peoples who had been liberated from the shackles of imperialism and had embarked on the socialist road, and clearly proved that no military technological advantage and barbaric war means of imperialism can conquer the people and armies of socialist countries educated by the Marxist-Leninist party with an indomitable revolutionary spirit.

Kim Kwang-hyup said that the Korean people will never forget the great achievements of the heroic officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers on our country's soil, and will pass them down to future generations with deep gratitude.

Kim Kwang-hyup said that the friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China have a long history and tradition. The traditional internationalist friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese people and armies has been further consolidated into an invincible force through the righteous common struggle against the U.S. imperialist aggressors. In socialist construction, the relations of mutual assistance and cooperation between the Korean and Chinese peoples are constantly expanding and developing. The visit to our country by the Military Friendship Delegation of the People's Republic of China headed by Comrade He Long is another clear manifestation of the unbreakable friendship and unity between our two peoples and armies.

Kim Kwang-hyup said that it has been two years since the Chinese People's Volunteers voluntarily withdrew completely from Korea in order to promote a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. However, the U.S. imperialists still occupy southern Korea as colonial rulers.

Kim Kwang-hyup said that the only way to save the people of southern Korea from unprecedented misfortune and suffering is to end the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops' occupation of South Korea and achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland on a democratic basis, as consistently advocated by our party and supported by unanimous world opinion.

Recently, our party and government put forward the most realistic and rational plan to open up a new situation for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. However, the U.S. imperialists are maliciously obstructing the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

The U.S. imperialists still do not want to withdraw from South Korea, but are turning the southern half of our country into a criminal atomic war base. At the same time, they are occupying Taiwan, an inseparable territory of the People's Republic of China. They are constantly carrying out provocative hostile actions against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait, and are also intensifying their aggressive activities against the Vietnamese people in South Vietnam.

Kim Kwang-hyup then condemned the U.S. imperialists for colluding with the reactionary ruling group of Japan to create the U.S.-Japan military treaty, and also for attempting to create a "Northeast Asia Military Alliance," interfering barbarously in the internal affairs of Laos, and openly carrying out aggressive activities against Laos. He said that the U.S. imperialists are carrying out aggressive activities not only in the Asian region, but also in Cuba and the Congo, and all over the world, and are frantically pursuing a "cold war" and a foolish policy of war preparations.

He said that U.S. imperialism is the gendarme of international reactionaries and the most vicious enemy of peace and mankind. We Korean people, who are directly confronting U.S. imperialism, cannot relax our vigilance for a moment and must be prepared to repel the enemy's aggression at any time.

Kim Kwang-hyup said that the peaceful reunification of our motherland can only be achieved if the entire Korean people strengthen our revolutionary forces in every possible way and wage a tenacious struggle to drive out the U.S. imperialist aggressors from South Korea. Today, under the wise leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung, the great achievements and the growth of political and economic power that our people have made in the struggle to build socialism have opened up a decisive and favorable situation for the great cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Kim Kwang-hyup said that no conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys can stop the unanimous aspiration of the entire Korean people to peacefully reunify the motherland. Today's situation is fundamentally different from when the U.S. imperialist aggressors launched the war of aggression in Korea ten years ago. The political, economic, and military power of the socialist camp is growing into an invincible force, which decisively overwhelms the imperialist forces of war. The growth of Soviet power has given the people all over the world who are fighting for peace and socialism great confidence and encouraged them to continue towards victory. Socialism has also achieved decisive victory on the vast land of China, and the People's Republic of China is rapidly transforming into a great socialist power.

He said that the fraternal Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, holding high the banner of the general line, are continuing the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction and have made great achievements in industry, agriculture, and all fronts of the people's economy. The People's Republic of China, together with the socialist fraternal countries, firmly adheres to a peaceful foreign policy and makes great contributions to strengthening the socialist forces of the world and to maintaining lasting peace in the East and the world.

Kim Kwang-hyup said that we once again solemnly warn the U.S. imperialist aggressors to stop their military provocations in South Korea and withdraw immediately. We fully support the proposal of the Government of the People's Republic of China that countries in Asia, including the United States, sign a treaty of mutual non-aggression and turn this region into a nuclear-free zone, and strongly demand that the U.S. imperialists immediately get out of Taiwan, the territory of China, and take away nuclear weapons and get out of all regions of Asia immediately.

Kim Kwang-hyup said that the Korean people and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army, holding high the banner of proletarian internationalism, in the great family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, will advance forever together with the fraternal Chinese people, and will resolutely fight to the end against the common enemy – U.S. imperialism.

Then, Marshal He Long stepped onto the podium amidst warm applause to speak.

Marshal He Long first, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, expressed sincere gratitude and the highest respect to the participants of the meeting, the entire heroic Korean people, and the Korean People's Army.

When talking about the people and armies of China and Korea fighting side by side to defeat the U.S. aggressors, Marshal He Long said that the paper tiger was punctured, and the myth of the invincibility of U.S. imperialism was shattered. The heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army, with their valiant struggle, not only extinguished the flames of war in Korea ignited by U.S. imperialism, safeguarded the security of the socialist camp, and saved world peace, but also greatly encouraged the firm confidence of the people all over the world in opposing U.S. imperialist aggression, striving for national independence and democratic freedom, and defending world peace.

He Long said that after the Korean armistice, the Korean people have continued their unremitting struggle to seek a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The Chinese government and people have always fully supported the peaceful initiatives of the Korean government and have repeatedly made contributions in their own practical actions to easing tensions in the Far East and promoting a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Two years ago, the Chinese People's Volunteers responded to the peaceful initiatives of the governments of China and Korea and completely withdrew from Korea. However, the U.S. aggressors, who stubbornly insisted on being enemies of the people of China and Korea, have never ceased their criminal activities of undermining the armistice agreement, deliberately obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, and escalating tensions in the Far East. Facts have proved that the nature of U.S. imperialism will not change. Marshal He Long said that our two countries are neighbors as closely related as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. In the struggle against imperialist aggression and oppression, the people of the two countries have always been in the same boat, sharing the same fate.

After praising the long-term flesh-and-blood relationship between the people of China and Korea, Marshal He Long pointed out that Marxism-Leninism teaches us that mutual support and mutual assistance are the basic principles of proletarian internationalism. The revolutionary cause of the proletariat-led in any country is inseparable from the international obligations of the proletariat. The friendship and unity between the people of our two countries, the friendship and unity between the people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, are important guarantees for our victory. The people of China and Korea and the people of all socialist countries know how to maintain this friendship and unity. The daydream of imperialism and modern revisionists to undermine this friendship and unity will never come true.

Marshal He Long then said that we are particularly pleased to see that our close comrades-in-arms – the heroic Korean people, under the strong leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, have been galloping forward on the socialist construction road on the Chollima, constantly making brilliant achievements in the short years since the armistice. Just as the Korean people have mounted the Chollima and accelerated towards socialism, the Chinese people, holding high the three red banners of the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, have achieved new achievements in socialist construction this year after the two consecutive Great Leap Forwards in 1958 and 1959; the upsurge in striving for continuous and comprehensive leap forwards in national economic development in the future is sweeping the country. Imperialism, reactionaries, and modern revisionists have deep-seated hatred for our country's construction achievements. However, no matter how viciously they attack our country, they cannot stop us from advancing victoriously towards our great goals.

He Long said that our government has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy; has always strived to ease international tensions and achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems; and this year, our government has signed treaties of friendship and non-aggression or peace and friendship with many countries in Asia and Africa. Our government has repeatedly proposed that countries in Asia and the Pacific Rim, including the United States, sign a treaty of mutual non-aggression and make this region a nuclear-free zone. However, U.S. imperialism stubbornly persists in its policy of hostility towards the socialist camp and refuses peaceful coexistence.

He Long said that no matter how rampant imperialism is, it cannot stop the leaping forward of the wheel of history. As long as we maintain due vigilance against imperialism, resolutely rely on the peace-loving people of the world, form the broadest united front, and wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism, then the U.S. imperialist policies of aggression and war can be completely crushed. The U.S. aggressors will sooner or later get out of southern Korea, out of Taiwan, the territory of our country, and out of the territory of other countries they occupy.

After Marshal He Long's speech, the meeting ended with the orchestra playing the Internationale.

After the meeting, Korean art troupes gave wonderful performances. (Attached pictures)

    平壤盛会纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝入朝参战十周年
    朝中人民战斗友谊是国际主义的典范
    金日成首相等党政领导人出席了大会，我军事友好代表团应邀参加金光侠大将作了长篇报告，贺龙元帅代表中国人民向朝鲜军民致敬
    新华社平壤24日电　平壤市各界二千多人今天晚上举行盛大的报告大会，纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝入朝参战十周年。
    会场主席台正中高悬着朝中两国国旗和金日成首相、毛泽东主席的巨幅画像。
    朝鲜内阁首相金日成出席了大会，参加大会的有崔庸健、金一、洪命熹、朴正爱、朴金喆、金昌满、郑一龙、南日、林海、河仰天、金翊善、郑准泽、李周渊等朝鲜党政领导人。参加大会的还有内阁各相，祖国战线议长团的议长们，各社会团体负责干部，朝鲜人民军高级将领等。
    由中国国防委员会副主席、国务院副总理贺龙元帅和国务院副总理、中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿大将率领的中华人民共和国访朝军事友好代表团，以及中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光和使馆全体外交官员应邀参加了大会。各国驻朝外交使节、外交官和武官也参加了大会。
    当金日成首相、崔庸健委员长等朝鲜党政领导人和中国军事友好代表团登上主席台时，全场响起热烈的欢呼声和掌声，长达十多分钟。
    朝鲜内阁副首相、平壤市人民委员会委员长郑一龙致开幕词后，朝鲜内阁副首相兼民族保卫相金光侠大将作了长篇报告。
    金光侠在报告中首先以朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府以及全体朝鲜人民的名义，谨向在反对美帝国主义侵略的正义的共同斗争中壮烈牺牲的中国人民的英勇儿女们致以崇高的敬意和荣誉，向以鲜血援助了朝鲜人民的、以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和全体中国人民以及前中国人民志愿军官兵们表示衷心的感谢。他还以全体朝鲜人民和人民军官兵的名义，向最亲密的邻邦的贵宾——以贺龙同志为团长的中华人民共和国访朝军事友好代表团和中国人民解放军文艺工作团表示热烈的欢迎。
    金光侠说，十年前在我们反对美帝国主义及其仆从国家武装侵略者的最艰苦的时期，中国人民的抗美援朝运动和中国人民志愿军的参战，无限地鼓舞了正在阻击着敌人的疯狂进攻并有效地准备着重新反攻的我国人民和人民军官兵们。美帝国主义尽管向朝鲜前线投入了莫大的兵力和现代武器，并用尽了一切野蛮手段，但是，在朝中两国人民军队的英雄的斗争和团结的威力面前，连续遭到了可耻的惨败，最后不得不签订了停战协定。
    他说，在朝鲜战争中，朝中两国人民和军队之间的团结和友谊成了无产阶级国际主义的活生生的典范，它将永远被记载在进步人类的史册上。
    金光侠说，朝中两国人民和军队，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各兄弟国家人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支持和声援下，战胜了美帝国主义侵略者，因而粉碎了美帝国主义企图强占全朝鲜、为反对社会主义阵营而扩大战火的凶恶侵略阴谋，为远东和世界和平的伟大事业作出了巨大的贡献。朝中两国人民和军队在朝鲜战争中取得的历史性胜利，显示了从帝国主义的羁绊下获得解放并已踏上了社会主义道路的觉醒了的东方人民所具有的牢不可破的威力，并清楚地证明了帝国主义的任何军事技术优势和野蛮的战争手段，都不能征服马克思列宁主义的党以不屈不挠的革命精神教育出来的社会主义国家人民和军队。
    金光侠说，朝鲜人民将永远不会忘记英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵们在我们祖国土地上所立下的伟大功勋，并以深深感谢的心情流传给子孙万代。
    金光侠说，朝中两国人民之间的友谊团结是有悠久历史和传统的。朝中人民和军队之间的传统性的国际主义友谊团结，通过反对美帝国主义侵略者的正义的共同斗争进一步巩固成了战无不胜的力量。在社会主义建设中，朝中两国人民之间的互助合作关系正在不断地扩大和发展。这次以贺龙同志为团长的中华人民共和国军事友好代表团的访问我国，是我们两国人民和军队之间的牢不可破的友谊团结的又一个明确表现。
    金光侠说，中国人民志愿军为了促进朝鲜问题的和平解决而主动的全部撤出朝鲜已经有两年了。但是，美帝国主义者却直到现在仍然强占着朝鲜南部，作为殖民地的统治者。
    金光侠说，从空前未闻的不幸和痛苦中拯救朝鲜南部人民的唯一途径，是我们党所一贯主张、并受到全世界舆论一致支持的结束美帝国主义侵略军对南朝鲜的强占、在民主的基础上实现祖国的和平统一。
    最近我们党和政府提出了为实现祖国的和平统一能够打开新局面的最现实和最合理的方案。但是，美帝国主义者恶毒地阻挠着朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    美帝国主义者，仍然不想从朝鲜南部撤出去，而是把我们祖国的南半部转变为罪恶的原子战争基地。它们同时强占着中华人民共和国不可分割的领土——台湾。它们在台湾海峡不断地进行着反对中国人民的挑衅性敌对行动，在越南南方也在加强着反对越南人民的侵略活动。
    金光侠接着谴责美帝国主义者勾结日本反动统治集团所制造的日美军事条约，还企图制造“东北亚军事同盟”，横暴地干涉老挝的内政，公然地进行着对老挝的侵略活动。他说，美帝国主义不仅在亚洲地区，而且在古巴和刚果以及在世界各处进行着侵略活动，疯狂地奉行着“冷战”和愚蠢的备战政策。
    他说，美帝国主义是国际反动派的宪兵，是和平和人类最凶恶的敌人。同美帝国主义直接地对峙着的我们朝鲜人民一刻也不能松懈警惕性，准备好随时反击敌人的侵略。
    金光侠说，我们祖国的和平统一，只有全体朝鲜人民百般加强我们的革命力量，为了从朝鲜南部赶走美帝国主义侵略者进行顽强的斗争，才能得到实现。今天，在朝鲜劳动党和金日成同志的英明领导下，我国人民在建设社会主义的斗争中所取得的巨大成就和政治经济威力的壮大，为和平统一祖国的伟大事业开辟了决定性的有利局面。
    金光侠说，美帝国主义及其走狗的任何阴谋诡计都不能阻止全体朝鲜人民要求和平统一祖国的一致志向。今天的形势已经根本不同于十年前美帝国主义侵略者在朝鲜发动侵略战争的时候了。社会主义阵营的政治、经济、军事的威力正在壮大成为战无不胜的力量，它决定性地压倒了帝国主义战争势力。苏联威力的壮大，给予了为和平和社会主义而斗争的全世界人民以巨大的信心，鼓舞着他们继续走向胜利。社会主义在广阔的中国大地上也取得了决定性胜利，中华人民共和国迅速地转变成了伟大的社会主义强国。
    他说，兄弟般的中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英明领导下高举总路线的旗帜，在社会主义建设中继续着大跃进，在工业、农业以及人民经济的各个战线取得巨大的成就。中华人民共和国同社会主义各兄弟国家一起，坚定不移地奉行着和平的对外政策，在增强世界的社会主义力量，在维护东方和世界的持久和平上作出巨大的贡献。
    金光侠说，我们再一次严肃地警告美帝国主义侵略者在朝鲜南部停止军事挑衅行动，立即撤出去。我们完全支持中华人民共和国政府关于在亚洲包括美国在内的太平洋沿岸各国签订互不侵犯的和平条约，并把这一地区变为无核武器的地区的建议，并且强硬要求美帝国主义者从中国领土台湾立即滚出去，从亚洲的一切地区收起核武器立即滚出去。
    金光侠说，朝鲜人民和人民军官兵们高举无产阶级国际主义旗帜，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭中，将和兄弟般的中国人民永远一道前进，将为反对共同敌人——美帝国主义而坚决地斗争到底。
    接着，贺龙元帅在热烈的掌声中登上讲台讲话。
    贺龙元帅首先代表中国人民和中国人民解放军，向大会参加者、全体英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，表示诚挚的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    贺龙元帅在谈到中朝两国人民和军队并肩战胜美国侵略者的时候说，纸老虎被戳穿了，美帝国主义不可战胜的神话破灭了。英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军以自己英勇的战斗，不仅扑灭了美帝国主义燃起的侵朝战火，保卫了社会主义阵营的安全，拯救了世界和平，而且大大鼓舞了全世界人民反对美帝国主义侵略、争取民族独立和民主自由，保卫世界和平的坚强信心。
    贺龙说，朝鲜停战以后，朝鲜人民为了谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，继续进行了坚持不懈的斗争。中国政府和人民，一贯全力支持朝鲜政府的和平倡议，并且一再以自己的实际行动，对和缓远东紧张局势和促进朝鲜问题的和平解决作出贡献。两年前，中国人民志愿军响应朝中两国政府的和平倡议，全部撤离了朝鲜。但是，顽固地坚持与朝中人民为敌的美国侵略者，却从未间断过其破坏停战协定、蓄意阻挠朝鲜和平统一、加剧远东紧张局势的罪恶活动。事实证明，美帝国主义的本性是不会改变的。贺龙元帅说，我们两国是唇齿相依、休戚与共的邻邦。两国人民在反对帝国主义的侵略和压迫的斗争中，从来是风雨同舟、祸福与共的。
    贺龙元帅在赞扬了中朝两国人民的长期血肉关系以后指出，马克思列宁主义教导我们，相互支持和相互援助，是无产阶级国际主义的基本原则。任何一个国家无产阶级领导的革命事业，同无产阶级的国际义务是不可分离的。我们两国人民的友谊和团结，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民的友谊和团结，是我们取得胜利的重要保证。中朝两国人民、社会主义各国人民是懂得怎样来维护这种友谊和团结的。帝国主义和现代修正主义者要破坏这种友谊和团结的痴心妄想，是永远不会实现的。
    贺龙元帅接着说，我们特别高兴地看到，我们的亲密战友——英雄的朝鲜人民，在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的坚强领导下，在停战后的短短几年中，跨着千里马，沿着社会主义建设大道不断飞驰前进，取得了辉煌的成就。同朝鲜人民跨上千里马加速向社会主义飞奔一样，中国人民高举党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，继1958年和1959年两年的连续大跃进之后，今年又在社会主义建设方面取得了新的成就；争取今后在国民经济发展中实现持续的、全面的跃进的热潮，正在席卷全国。帝国主义、反动派和现代修正主义者对我国的建设成就，有着刻骨的嫉恨。但是，不管他们怎样对我国进行恶毒的攻击，都不能够阻挡我们朝着自己的伟大目标胜利前进。
    贺龙说，我国政府一贯奉行和平外交政策；一贯努力争取缓和国际紧张局势，实现不同社会制度国家和平共处；今年以来，我国政府先后同亚非许多国家签订了友好和互不侵犯条约或和平友好条约。我国政府一再倡议亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内，签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约，使这个地区成为无核武器地区。但是，美帝国主义却顽固地坚持敌视社会主义阵营的政策，拒绝和平共处。
    贺龙说，任凭帝国主义穷凶极恶，它也无法阻挡历史车轮的飞跃前进。只要对帝国主义保持应有的警惕，坚决依靠全世界爱好和平的人民，结成最广泛的统一战线，同美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，那末，美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策是完全可以被粉碎的。美国侵略者迟早要从朝鲜南部，从我国领土台湾，从它所占领的其他国家的领土上滚开的。
    贺龙元帅讲话后，大会在乐队高奏国际歌的乐声中结束。
    大会后，朝鲜的艺术团体作了精彩演出。（附图片）
