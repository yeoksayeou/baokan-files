    On-Site Cellaring Reduces Damage
    On-site cellaring is a good method for storing sweet potatoes. The Machang Brigade of the Macun Commune in Qingfeng County, Henan Province, has used this method to store sweet potatoes since 1957, and they have not spoiled for three consecutive years. The storage method is to choose a high, leeward, and sunny location in the sweet potato field to dig cellars that are five or six feet wide and seven or eight feet deep in a north-south direction. The length of the cellar can be determined according to the amount of sweet potatoes to be stored. Before the sweet potatoes enter the cellar, a layer of four or five inches of straw is laid on the bottom of the cellar. The sweet potatoes entering the cellar should have stems attached, and two or three feet of space should be left at the cellar opening to allow air to circulate inside the cellar. The sweet potatoes should be covered with a layer of corn stalks and stubble to prevent water droplets that evaporate to the top of the cellar from falling on the potatoes.
    On-site cellaring is suitable for areas with large-scale sweet potato cultivation. Its advantage is that it reduces the transportation process and avoids bruising and bumping of the potato tubers.

    就地窖藏减少损伤
    就地窖藏是贮存甘薯的一种好办法。河南省清丰县马村公社马厂大队从1957年开始用这个办法贮存甘薯，一连三年没有坏过。贮存的办法是在甘薯地里选择地势高、背风向阳的地方，南北向挖五、六尺宽，七、八尺深的窖，窖的长短可根据所贮甘薯的多少而定。甘薯入窖以前，在窖底铺上四、五寸厚的秸秆，入窖的甘薯要带薯梗，窖口要留二、三尺的空间，使窖内空气流通。甘薯的上面要盖上一层玉米秸和谷茬，防止蒸发到窖顶盖的水珠落在薯上。
    就地窖藏适合于大面积种植甘薯的地区。它的好处是减少运输过程，避免碰伤和撞伤薯块。
