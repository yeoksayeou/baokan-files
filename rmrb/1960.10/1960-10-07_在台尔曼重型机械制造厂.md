    At the Thälmann Heavy Machinery Factory
    By our correspondent Zhang Xinmin

    Across from the central train station in Magdeburg, on a tall building, is the mark of “Hammer and Anvil.” This is the state-owned Ernst Thälmann Heavy Machinery Factory. Fifteen years ago, this factory was the property of the German monopoly capital Krupp concern, specializing in manufacturing tanks for Hitler. After the victory of the anti-fascist war, it was confiscated. In 1954, the Soviet government returned it to the German Democratic Republic. Since then, it has become the property of the people of the German Democratic Republic, named after the founder of the German Communist Party, Ernst Thälmann. The villa of the monopoly capitalist Krupp here has also become a hospital for workers.

    Today, the Ernst Thälmann Heavy Machinery Factory is the largest heavy machinery factory in the German Democratic Republic. Its thirty-four workshops and more than 10,000 employees produce complete sets of equipment for manufacturing cement, mining and metallurgical equipment, heavy cranes, and atomic power generation equipment, with an annual value of approximately 240 million marks. Its products not only directly serve the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic, but also, to a greater extent, are exported to support and assist the construction of various socialist countries and Asian and African countries striving for national independence. Its export production accounts for 80% of its total output value. In this way, the workers of the Ernst Thälmann Heavy Machinery Factory have established friendships with the working people of various countries through their labor achievements. In the center of the dining hall of the factory's eleventh workshop hangs a banner presented to the factory by the Daye Steel Plant in our country. Here, when workers meet Chinese guests, they always like to inquire about the production and life of Chinese workers, both past and present.

    On the eve of the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, we visited this factory. At this time, the factory was implementing the resolution of the Ninth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee on improving the machinery manufacturing industry: systematically carrying out the socialist reconstruction of the factory and studying how to obtain greater economic benefits. The Thälmann Heavy Machinery Factory is an old factory. This June marks the 105th anniversary of its founding. In some workshops, you can still see seventy-year-old machine tools driven by belts. The factory's products are varied in accordance with order arrangements. Under these circumstances, it is quite difficult to promote socialist reconstruction. But people still came up with a solution: first, to mechanize operations using small tools, and reduce the variety of products from 2,000 to 300 in order to promote standardization, and gradually update machines that are too old. In this way, the factory plans to increase labor productivity by 29% and reduce production costs by 20% by 1965, the last year of the seven-year plan, without increasing the labor force. The factory held about 300 meetings, and the workers put forward 1,150 suggestions to promote the realization of the reconstruction plan.

    In May of this year, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party issued a call to save raw materials. Saving raw materials is of particular importance to the industry of the German Democratic Republic, which is not rich in resources. In the current situation where West Germany unreasonably decided to sever trade relations with the German Democratic Republic, this struggle is even more urgent. The workers of the Thälmann Heavy Machinery Factory actively responded to this call, and the factory formulated a plan to save one million marks by the end of this year. By the end of September, the factory had already saved 900,000 marks and was preparing to overfulfill the plan.

    In mid-September, eighteen socialist labor teams from various machinery manufacturing factories in Magdeburg jointly issued a challenge to the city's 113,000 machinery manufacturing workers, calling on the city's machinery workers to further adopt new technologies and save raw materials. Two socialist labor teams in the Thälmann Heavy Machinery Factory were also the initiators of this challenge. This challenge was quickly responded to by the factory's advanced production teams. The factory's saving vanguard—the Fanse production team—responded first. The Fanse production team ranks among the top in the 275 production teams in the factory participating in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team." In the heavy crane manufacturing workshop of the Thälmann Heavy Machinery Factory, this production team is a main force. Last year, they produced sixteen cranes for the country, and this year they plan to produce eighteen. The captain, Fanse, only seventeen years old twenty years ago, entered this arsenal of the Krupp concern to work and serve the big monopoly capitalists. Now that this factory has become the property of the worker-peasant state, Fanse has become the production team leader. We visited the heavy crane manufacturing workshop where the Fanse production team is located. They are manufacturing a heavy crane capable of lifting 270 tons. In the past, it would take thirty months to complete such a machine, but now, thanks to their efforts, the project has been shortened to seventeen months. The production team is not satisfied and is trying to further shorten the manufacturing time. Originally, the team had set a savings plan to save 9,000 marks for the country this year, but now they have already overfulfilled the plan and saved 14,000 marks. After receiving the challenge from the eighteen socialist labor teams in the city, the entire team stepped up their efforts and put forward their conditions for responding to the challenge: to save another 4,000 marks for the country by the end of the year, to double the completion of the savings plan, and to maintain a record of no defective products. To achieve superior quality in the production of the next crane and further shorten the production time.

    On the day of celebrating the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the Fanse production team will be one of the three production teams in the factory to be awarded the title of "Socialist Labor Team." The history of the Fanse production team's participation in this competition is only ten months ago. Before participating in the competition, although the number of people in the team was the same as now, which was twelve, everyone's hearts were not united. Some people said: "What is the point of engaging in a 'Socialist Labor Team'? Isn't it all the same work!" After three months of persuasion by the captain and the trade union group leader, everyone agreed to participate in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team." Over the past ten months, the production team has made significant progress. Now, all twelve members of the team, from the fifty-five-year-old Georg to the twenty-one-year-old Hasan, are united as one, fulfilling their competition conditions, and often studying together. Their wives and fiancées have also become friends. The Fanse production team also launched writing activities. Originally, in the trade union of the Thälmann Heavy Machinery Factory, there was a writer specially responsible for guiding workers in writing. This writer is Kuburger. He was originally a worker in a tram factory. Not long ago, he graduated from the Leipzig Writers' Academy and officially changed his career to do this work. When Kuburger talked to us about his background, he said excitedly that he never thought that a worker who had only received elementary education could enter the Writers' Academy to study and realize his writing wish that he had liked since he was a child. He said that he felt happy in his heart when he thought of these things. It is also for this reason that Kuburger, although he is already gray-haired, is full of energy. He serves as a writing instructor in several factories, and every day he either studies writing with the workers or discusses works with them.

    We walked through several workshops of the Thälmann Heavy Machinery Factory, and at the entrance of the workshops, we saw propaganda posters with slogans like this: "Today's hard work is for tomorrow's happy life." The young man Markman in the Fanse production team said it well, how can the beautiful ideals of the future be realized? It depends on our own labor. Indeed, among the more than 10,000 employees of the Ernst Thälmann Heavy Machinery Factory, 8,000 have now participated in labor competitions, and more than 4,000 have participated in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team." The workers are making greater contributions to socialist construction with active labor. (Attached picture)

    在台尔曼重型机械制造厂
    本报记者　张辛民
    在马格德堡市中心火车站对面的高楼上，有“锤子和铁砧”的标记。这就是国营恩斯特·台尔曼重型机械制造厂。十五年前，这个工厂还是德国大垄断资本克虏伯康采恩的财产，专给希特勒制造坦克。反法西斯战争胜利结束后被没收。1954年，苏联政府把它归还给德意志民主共和国，从此，它成为德意志民主共和国人民的财产，冠上了德国共产党创建人恩斯特·台尔曼的名字。垄断资本家克虏伯在这里的一座别墅，也成了工人的医院。
    今天，恩斯特·台尔曼重型机械制造厂是德意志民主共和国最大的重型机械制造厂。它的三十四个车间，一万多名职工，每年生产着大约价值二亿四千万马克的制造水泥的成套设备、矿山冶金设备、重型起重机以及原子能发电设备等等。它的产品不只是直接为德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设服务，更多的还是出口，支援和帮助各个社会主义国家和亚非民族独立国家的建设。它的出口生产占全部产值的80％。这样，恩斯特·台尔曼重型机械制造厂的工人就通过自己的劳动成绩和各国劳动人民建立了友谊。在工厂第十一车间的饭厅正中墙上，挂着我国大冶钢厂送给这个工厂的一面锦旗。在这里，工人们见到中国客人时，也总喜欢打听中国工人的生产和生活，过去和今天的情况。
    在德意志民主共和国建国十一周年节日前夕，我们访问了这个工厂。这时，厂里正在贯彻党的九中全会关于改进机械制造工业的决议：有计划地进行工厂的社会主义改建和研究如何获得更大的经济利益。台尔曼重型机械制造厂是个老厂。到今年6月正好是它建厂一百零五周年纪念。有的车间里，还可以看到靠皮带带动的七十年前的机床。厂子的产品根据订货安排，品种繁杂。在这种情况下，推行社会主义改建有相当多的困难。但是人们还是想出了办法：首先是将使用小工具的操作都实现机械化，把产品品种从二千种减到三百种，以便推行标准化，对于年代过久的机器则开始逐步更新。这样，全厂计划到七年计划最后一年的1965年，在不增加劳动力的前提下，要使劳动生产率比1958年提高29％，生产成本降低20％。工厂举行了三百来次会议，职工们提出了一千一百五十条建议，来促进改建计划的实现。
    今年5月，统一社会党中央发出节约原材料的号召。节约原材料，对资源不够丰富的德意志民主共和国工业，有着特别重要的意义。在当前西德无理决定同德意志民主共和国断绝贸易关系的情况下，这个斗争就更加迫切。台尔曼重型机械制造厂的工人积极响应这一号召，全厂制订了到今年年底节约一百万马克的计划。到9月底，全厂已经节约了九十万马克，正准备超计划完成。
    9月中旬，马格德堡市各机械制造厂的十八个社会主义劳动队又联名向全市十一万三千名机械制造工人下了战书，号召全市机械工人进一步采用新技术，节约原材料。台尔曼重型机械制造厂中的两个社会主义劳动队也是这个挑战的发起人。这个挑战迅速得到了厂里先进生产队的响应。全厂的节约先锋——樊塞生产队首先响应。樊塞生产队在全厂参加争取“社会主义劳动队”称号竞赛的二百七十五个生产队中，数得上头几名，在台尔曼重型机械制造厂的重型起重机制造车间中，这个生产队是一支主力军，去年他们为国家生产了十六台起重机，今年准备生产十八台。队长樊塞二十年前才十七岁时，就进了克虏伯康采恩的这个兵工厂做工，为大垄断资本家做马牛。现在这个工厂成了工农国家的财产，樊塞当了生产队长。我们参观了樊塞生产队所在的重型起重机制造车间，他们这个生产队正制造一台能起二百七十吨的重型起重机。这种机器，过去要用三十个月才能完工，现在经过他们的努力，工程已经缩短到十七个月。生产队还不满足，正在想办法进一步缩短制造时间。原来队里订了节约计划，准备今年为国家节约九千马克，现在他们早已超额完成计划，节约了一万四千马克。在接到全市十八个社会主义劳动队的挑战后，全队又加了把劲，提出了自己的应战条件：到年底再为国家节约四千马克，加倍完成节约计划，保持不出废品的记录。在生产下一个起重机时达到优级质量，进一步缩短制作时间。
    当庆祝德意志民主共和国成立十一周年的这一天，樊塞生产队将是这个厂被授予“社会主义劳动队”称号的三个生产队之一。提起樊塞生产队参加这个竞赛的历史，那不过是十个月以前的事。在参加竞赛前，队里的人数虽然和现在一样是十二个人，但是大家心不齐。有的人说：“搞什么‘社会主义劳动队’啊，还不都是一样劳动！”经过队长和工会小组长三个月的说服工作，大家才都同意参加争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛。十个月来，生产队的进步显著。现在，全队十二个人，从五十五岁的格奥尔到二十一岁的哈藏，大家团结成一个人一样，履行自己的竞赛条件，还经常在一起学习，他们的妻子、未婚妻也都成了朋友。樊塞生产队还展开了写作活动。原来在台尔曼重型机械制造厂的工会里，专门有一位作家负责指导工人们写作。这位作家是库布尔格尔。他本是电车厂的工人，不久以前，才在莱比锡作家学院毕业，正式改行来做这个工作。库布尔格尔向我们谈起自己的身世时兴奋地说，他从来没有想到一个只受过初级国民教育的工人，能够进作家学院学习，实现从小就喜欢的写作愿望。他说，想起这些他就从心里高兴。也正是因此，库布尔格尔虽然已白发苍苍，但是精神焕发，他身兼几个工厂的写作指导，每天不是同工人研究写作，就是带着他们讨论作品。
    我们走过台尔曼重型机械制造厂的几个车间，在车间的进口处都看见写着这样标语的宣传画：“今天的紧张劳动，是为了明天的幸福生活”。樊塞生产队中的年青小伙子马克曼说得好，未来的美好的理想怎么实现呢？要靠我们自己的劳动啊。的确，在恩斯特·台尔曼重型机械制造厂的一万多名职工中，现在已有八千名参加了劳动竞赛，其中又有四千多名参加了争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛。工人们正以积极的劳动为社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。（附图片）
