Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 18th: Vietnam News Agency reported today that the Liaison Delegation of the Supreme Command of the Vietnam People's Army recently wrote to the International Commission in Vietnam, requesting an on-the-spot investigation into the continuous acts of retaliation by the South Vietnamese authorities against former resistance personnel in Binh Dinh province in central and southern Vietnam.

In a letter to the International Commission dated October 17, the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army stated that former resistance personnel in Binh Dinh province and their families were divided into two categories, namely "illegal" citizens and "semi-legal" citizens. Almost all those classified as Category A were former resistance personnel whose relatives had regrouped in the North in accordance with the Geneva Accords. They were held in prisons and concentration camps. The Qui Nhon prison alone held more than 2,000 people. The other category included former resistance personnel who did not have relatives in the North. They were forced to live in special zones surrounded by barbed wire and were subject to close surveillance.

The land and property distributed to them by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam during the Anti-French Resistance War, as well as the hundreds of hectares of land they had reclaimed since the restoration of peace, were confiscated by the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities. They also had to pay back rent and taxes that had been exempted during the Anti-French Resistance War, and contribute to the so-called "Fund for Reporting Communists" and the "Security Fund."

The Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army also pointed out to the International Commission that in recent years, thousands of patriots in South Vietnam have been imprisoned, tortured, or killed in successive "Report Communists" campaigns. More than 100 former resistance personnel in Phu My post were massacred, and their bodies were thrown into caves. In order to force women whose husbands had regrouped in the North to sign statements requesting divorce, they were subjected to inhuman torture.

    越南人民军联络代表团致函国际委员会
    强烈抗议吴庭艳集团迫害前抗战人员
    据新华社河内18日电　据越南通讯社今天报道，越南人民军最高司令部联络代表团最近写信给越南国际委员会，要求实地调查越南南方当局对越南中南部平定省前抗战人员的连续不断的报复行为。
    越南人民军联络代表团于10月17日致国际委员会的信中说，平定省前抗战人员和他们的家属被分为甲、乙两类，即分为“不合法”公民和“半合法”公民。几乎所有被列为甲类的人都是根据日内瓦协议的规定有亲属在北方重新集结的前抗战人员。他们被关在监狱和集中营里。仅仅归仁监狱就关了两千多人。另一类人包括没有亲属在北方的前抗战人员。他们被赶到四周有铁丝网的特别区居住，并受到严密的监视。
    抗战时期由越南民主共和国分给他们的土地和财产以及他们在恢复和平以后开垦的几百公顷土地都被吴庭艳当局没收了。他们还不得不补缴在抗战时期免交的地租和捐税，并为所谓“告发共产党人基金”和“安全基金”捐款。
    越南人民军联络代表团还向国际委员会指出，近年来，越南南方的数以千计的爱国者在历次“告发共产党人”运动中遭到监禁、拷打或杀害。富美驿有一百多名前抗战人员被屠杀，尸体被投入岩洞里。为了强迫那些丈夫在北方重新集结的妇女在要求离婚的声明书上签名，对她们进行了惨无人道的拷打。
