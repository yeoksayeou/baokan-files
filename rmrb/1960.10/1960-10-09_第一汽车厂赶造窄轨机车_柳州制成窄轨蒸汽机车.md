Xinhua News Agency, Changchun. The First Automobile Works recently produced 1,000 narrow-gauge locomotives. These were specially manufactured by the automobile factory workers to support the current steel and coal production in various regions.

This type of narrow-gauge locomotive has a simple structure and is very suitable for use on light mine railways and earthen railways. Each vehicle can carry 100 tons of cargo, replacing 200 miners pushing carts manually, with a speed of 25 to 40 kilometers per hour.

The narrow-gauge locomotive is a new product. In the spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economical," the First Automobile Works adopted the method of largely utilizing general parts from the "Liberation" brand automobile and adding some new parts, and successfully trial-produced it in only one month. After road tests and inspection and appraisal by relevant departments, it was put into mass production in August. By mid-September, the factory had overfulfilled the first batch production task.

This newspaper reports: Workers at the Liuzhou Railway Factory in Guangxi recently manufactured a "E'shan" (Goose Mountain) No. 040 narrow-gauge steam locomotive. After test runs, the quality fully met the design requirements.

The "E'shan" locomotive is specially designed for small railways. It can pull over 360 tons of cargo, traveling at 25 kilometers per hour. Its characteristics are: lightweight body; a dedicated coal and water tender, capable of continuous operation for over 100 kilometers without adding coal or water, facilitating long-distance transportation; and a highly sensitive braking device – an air brake – ensuring safe operation under heavy loads and high speeds.

The "E'shan" locomotive has more than 13,000 parts, large and small. All of these parts were designed and manufactured by the workers of the Liuzhou Railway Factory themselves.

    第一汽车厂赶造窄轨机车
    柳州制成窄轨蒸汽机车
    据新华社长春电　第一汽车制造厂最近生产了一千辆窄轨机车。这是汽车厂职工专为支援当前各地钢铁煤炭生产而赶制的。
    这种窄轨机车结构简单，很适于在矿山轻便铁轨和土铁路上使用。每车载重一百吨，可代替二百个矿工用人力推车运输，时速为二十五至四十公里。
    窄轨机车是新产品。第一汽车制造厂本着多快好省的精神，采取大部分利用“解放牌”汽车通用零件和增添部分新零件的办法，只用一个月时间就试制成功。经过行车考验和有关部门检查、鉴定，于8月份开始大批投入生产。到9月中旬止，全厂就超额完成了第一批生产任务。
  　本报讯　广西柳州铁路工厂职工最近制成一台鹅山号040型窄轨蒸汽机车。经过试车，质量完全符合设计要求。
    鹅山号机车是专供小铁路用的，它可以牵引三百六十多吨重的货物，每小时行驶二十五公里。它的特点是：车身轻；有专门储存煤水的煤水车，能连续行驶一百多公里不需要加煤加水，便于长途运输；有高度灵敏的刹车装置——汽闸，在载重多，速度高的条件下，能够保证安全运行。
    鹅山号机车的配件，大小有一万三千多件。这些配件全部是由柳州铁路工厂职工自己设计制造出来的。
