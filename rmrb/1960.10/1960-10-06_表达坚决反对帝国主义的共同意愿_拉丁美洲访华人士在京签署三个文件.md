Xinhua News Agency, October 5th: Latin American delegations and individuals from fifteen countries who are visiting China jointly signed three documents in the Great Hall of the People this evening, expressing their common will. These documents expressed support for the Cuban revolution and emphasized strengthening the unity and friendship between the people of Latin American countries and the Chinese people, unanimously supporting the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and China, and supporting the Cuban revolutionary movement.

The three documents are: "A Letter to the Chinese People," "Statement on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations Between Cuba and the People's Republic of China and on Supporting the Cuban Revolution," and "Statement on Friendship Associations Between Latin American Countries and China."

The Latin American guests nominated Jean Latortue, head of the Haitian Cultural Friendship Delegation, to preside over the signing ceremony. Before signing, he thanked the Chinese friends on behalf of the Latin American guests visiting China. He said, "We are very happy to have such a good opportunity to gather with Chinese friends and Latin American friends. Since the independence of Latin American countries, imperialism has always divided us. Today, Chinese friends give us such a good opportunity to visit their great country and give us such a good opportunity to have a friendly and united gathering. Such an opportunity is impossible in Latin America today except in Cuba."

He said, "Imperialism divides us, but friendship with the Chinese people unites us." His words aroused warm applause from the Chinese and foreign guests present.

After Jean Latortue spoke, he invited Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, to speak. Guo Moruo said, "Latin America is far away from China, but the Chinese and Latin American people are of one heart. The people of Latin America and the Chinese people have a common enemy, which is U.S. imperialism, which threatens world peace."

Guo Moruo said, "The people of Latin American countries stand on the front line of opposing imperialism and defending world peace. Your cause, your victory, is our cause, is our victory. The Chinese people are willing to unite with the people of Latin America forever to strive for the common victory of the common cause." Guo Moruo finally wished the two hundred million people of more than twenty Latin American countries to unite as one to fight against U.S. imperialism, to strive for the prosperity and happiness of the people of Latin American countries, and to defend world peace.

Guo Moruo's warm and friendly wishes won prolonged and enthusiastic applause from the audience.

One hundred and four foreign guests from fifteen Latin American countries signed the documents tonight. These countries are: Venezuela, Uruguay, Peru, Panama, Mexico, Haiti, Honduras, Dominican Republic, Chile, Cuba, Colombia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Bolivia, and Argentina. They belong to various aspects of cultural, press, political and legal, health, trade, peace organizations, and youth visiting delegations and individuals.

After the signing, according to the decision of the Latin American delegations, the three documents were sent separately to the China-Latin America Friendship Association and the Cuban Cultural Delegation to be handed over to the Cuban Revolutionary Government.

Chu Tunan, President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association, expressed his gratitude to the foreign guests from Latin American countries, and congratulated the people of Latin American countries on their victory in the national democratic struggle, their victory in the struggle against the war policy and aggression policy of U.S. imperialism, and wished the friendship between the Chinese and Latin American people would last forever.

Visentina Antuña Davio, head of the Cuban Cultural Delegation, also made a brief speech after the signing. She said that our main task is to oppose imperialism. She expressed her gratitude to the people of Latin American countries and the Chinese people for their support for the Cuban revolution and their support for the Havana Declaration.

Chinese figures from all walks of life who were invited to attend the signing ceremony also included: Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace; Hu Yuzhi, Ji Chaoding, Dong Chuncai, and Zhou Erfu, Vice Presidents of the China-Latin America Friendship Association, as well as other leaders of various people's organizations: Zhang Zhiran, Zhang Zhixiang, Li Zaiwen, Zhang Chao, Liu Qingyang, Nan Hanchen, Lao She, Mei Lanfang, Lü Ji, Wu Zuoren, etc.

After the signing ended, foreign guests from Latin American countries and Chinese people from all walks of life enthusiastically raised their glasses to congratulate. Chinese artists finally performed wonderful programs for the foreign guests.

A Letter to the Chinese People
Xinhua News Agency, October 5th: Latin American delegations and individuals visiting China who were invited to participate in the celebration of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China jointly issued a letter to the Chinese people today. The full text is as follows:

A Letter to the Chinese People
Although the enemy of friendship between people—imperialism—has built walls, under the radiant sun of New China, at the moment of commemorating the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, in the joyful atmosphere full of all the Chinese people and all the invited guests, many Latin American delegations and individuals gather in Beijing. We are willing to express our love to the oldest people in the world who are moving along the bright and eternally youthful road.

As representatives from countries that have been severely exploited and invaded by imperialism, we express our congratulations with excitement to the people of this country for the great achievements they have made so far, the people of this country who were unfortunately oppressed by 20th-century imperialism and colonialism yesterday.

The great achievements made by the Chinese people in industry, agriculture, society, and culture are our achievements.

The day will come when the flags of all nations will converge after a comprehensive victory in the struggle against imperialism, and all nations will live in peace and friendship.

The people of Latin American countries will always be friends of the Chinese people.

Statement on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations Between Cuba and the People's Republic of China and on Supporting the Cuban Revolution
Xinhua News Agency, October 5th: Latin American delegations and individuals visiting China who are participating in the celebration of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China issued a statement today on the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the People's Republic of China and on supporting the Cuban Revolution. The full text is as follows:

Statement on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations Between Cuba and the People's Republic of China and on Supporting the Cuban Revolution
The Latin American representatives participating in the celebration of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China believe that it is necessary to express to the people of this country that, although our personal opinions and ideologies are different, we unanimously support the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the People's Republic of China and unanimously support the Havana Declaration. We believe that the Havana Declaration is a just counterattack against the so-called "San José Declaration of Costa Rica"—which is essentially just a new program for interfering in the internal affairs of Latin American countries. We believe that this declaration also means the prospect of progress and welfare in Latin America, and also means the strengthening of world peace.

Recognizing the great significance of the Havana Declaration, the delegations and individuals who signed below will always make the greatest efforts to strengthen and connect the movement in our countries to support the Cuban revolution, making this movement a pillar of our people's struggle for complete and thorough liberation.

Statement on Friendship Associations Between Latin American Countries and China
Xinhua News Agency, October 5th: Latin American delegations and individuals visiting China who are participating in the celebration of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China issued a statement today on friendship associations between Latin American countries and China. The full text is as follows:

Statement on Friendship Associations Between Latin American Countries and China
We, the Latin American people who are participating in the celebration of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, gathered in Beijing and decided to issue the following statement:

1. Our various delegations represent different political tendencies, professions, and human activities; however, we are in complete agreement that the experience of fighting against imperialism and feudal backwardness and building a new China is of special significance to the entire Latin America.

2. After we return to our respective countries, we must publicize our understanding of China, but we know that each of us has his own different views on what he sees, therefore, we know that after we return to our respective countries, it will be very interesting to exchange reports and publicity work with each other.

3. In addition to exchanging individual reports among ourselves, we believe that the effort to increasingly strengthen the organizations of China Friendship Associations in Latin American countries and to increase their mutual connections is the most important. We are willing to sow the seeds in this way for the establishment of a Latin American China Friendship Association in Latin America, so as to become a coordinating organization for the existing Friendship Associations in Latin American countries. We believe that although imperialism has always attempted to alienate our countries, friendship with China helps the unity of these countries.

4. We believe that the address of this new association should be located in "America's Land of Freedom"—Cuba.

We suggest that the heads of each delegation take practical measures to achieve these lofty goals.

    新华社5日讯　拉丁美洲十五个国家的访华代表团和访华人士，今天晚间在人民大会堂共同签署了表达他们共同意愿的三个文件，这些文件表示支持古巴革命，并且强调加强拉丁美洲各国人民与中国人民的团结和促进友谊的发展。
    这三个文件是：“致中国人民的一封信”、“关于古巴和中华人民共和国之间建立外交关系和关于支持古巴革命的声明”、“关于拉丁美洲各国与中国之间的友好协会的声明”。
    拉丁美洲的外宾推举海地文化友好代表团团长让·拉脱主持签字仪式。在签字以前，他代表拉丁美洲各国访华的外宾，向中国朋友们表示感谢。他说，我们很高兴今天有这样一个好机会同中国朋友及拉丁美洲各国朋友们聚会在一起，自从拉丁美洲各国独立以来，帝国主义总是把我们分裂开来。今天中国朋友们给我们这样好的机会来访问他们伟大的国家，并且给我们这样好的机会来作一次友谊、团结的聚会。像这样的机会在今天的拉丁美洲除古巴以外是不可能有的。
    他说，帝国主义分裂我们，但是同中国人民的友谊把我们团结起来了。他的话激起了全场中外来宾热烈的掌声。
    让·拉脱讲话以后，他邀请中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若讲话。郭沫若说，拉丁美洲隔中国很远，但是中国和拉丁美洲人民是一条心，拉丁美洲的人民同中国人民有共同的敌人，这就是威胁世界和平的美帝国主义。
    郭沫若说，拉丁美洲各国人民站在反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的最前线，你们的事业，你们的胜利，就是我们的事业，就是我们的胜利。中国人民愿意永远同拉丁美洲人民团结在一起，来争取共同事业的共同胜利。郭沫若最后祝拉丁美洲二十多个国家的两亿人民团结得像一个人一样，为反对美帝国主义，为争取拉丁美洲各国人民的繁荣和幸福，为保卫世界和平而斗争。
    郭沫若的这些热情友好的祝愿，博得了全场长时间的热烈的掌声。
    今天晚上在文件上签字的有十五个拉丁美洲国家的一百零四位外宾。这些国家是：委内瑞拉、乌拉圭、秘鲁、巴拿马、墨西哥、海地、洪都拉斯、多米尼加、智利、古巴、哥伦比亚、巴西、哥斯达黎加、玻利维亚和阿根廷。他们属于文化、新闻、政法、卫生、贸易、和平组织、青年等各方面的访华代表团和访华人士。
    签字以后，根据拉丁美洲各国代表团的决定，把三个文件分送给中国拉丁美洲友好协会和古巴文化代表团转交古巴革命政府。
    中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南向拉丁美洲各国外宾表示感谢，并且祝贺拉丁美洲各国人民在民族民主的斗争中取得胜利，在反对美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策的斗争中取得胜利，祝贺中国拉丁美洲人民的友谊万古长青。
    古巴文化代表团团长维森蒂娜·安图尼亚·达维奥也在签字以后作了简单的致词，她说，我们的主要任务是反对帝国主义。她表示感谢拉丁美洲各国人民和中国人民对古巴革命的支持，对哈瓦那宣言的支持。
    应邀参加签字仪式的中国方面的各界人士还有：中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席包尔汉，中国拉丁美洲友好协会副会长胡愈之、冀朝鼎、董纯才、周而复，以及其他各人民团体的负责人：张志让、张致祥、栗再温、张超、刘清扬、南汉宸、老舍、梅兰芳、吕骥、吴作人等。

    致中国人民的一封信
    新华社5日讯　应邀来我国参加建国十一周年庆祝典礼的拉丁美洲访华代表团和访华人士，今天联合发表了致中国人民的一封信，全文如下：
    致中国人民的一封信
    虽然人们之间的友谊的敌人——帝国主义——筑下了城墙，但在新中国的光芒四射的阳光下，在中华人民共和国成立十一周年纪念的时刻，在全中国人民和所有应邀访问的来宾充满着欢乐的气氛中，许多拉丁美洲代表团和人士聚会在北京。我们愿向这个正沿着光明和永远青春道路前进的世界上最古老的人民表示我们的热爱。
    作为来自受到帝国主义严重剥削和侵略的国家的代表，以激动的心情向这个国家的人民到目前为止所取得的巨大成就表示祝贺，这个国家的人民在昨天还不幸地受着二十世纪的帝国主义和殖民主义的压迫。
    中国人民在工业、农业、社会、文化各方面所取得的巨大成就，就是我们的成就。
    在反对帝国主义的斗争取得全面胜利之后，各国人民的旗帜将汇合在一起，各个民族都将生活在和平和友谊之中，这样的一天就要到来。
    拉丁美洲各国人民永远是中国人民的朋友。

    关于古巴和中华人民共和国之间建立
    外交关系和关于支持古巴革命的声明
    新华社5日讯　在我国参加建国十一周年庆祝典礼的拉丁美洲访华代表团和访华人士，今天发表了关于古巴和中华人民共和国之间建立外交关系和关于支持古巴革命的声明，全文如下：
    关于古巴和中华人民共和国之间建立外交关系和关于支持古巴革命的声明
    在中国参加庆祝建国十一周年的拉丁美洲代表们，认为有必要向这个国家的人民表示，虽然我们各人的见解和思想意识不同，但是我们一致支持古巴和中华人民共和国之间建立外交关系以及一致支持哈瓦那宣言。我们认为哈瓦那宣言是针对着所谓“哥斯达黎加圣约瑟宣言”——这个实质上只不过是一个干涉拉丁美洲国家内政的新纲领——的一个正义的反击。我们认为这个宣言也意味着拉丁美洲的进步和福利的远景，也意味着对世界和平的加强。
    由于认定哈瓦那宣言具有重大的意义，我们在下面签字的代表团和人士们将永远以最大的努力来使我们国家的支援古巴革命的运动得以加强并互相联系，使这个运动成为我们的人民争取完全和彻底解放的斗争的支柱。　　　　　　　　　　1960年10月5日于北京
          关于拉丁美洲各国与中国之间的友好协会的声明
    新华社5日讯　在我国参加建国十一周年庆祝典礼的拉丁美洲访华代表团和访华人士，今天发表了关于拉丁美洲各国与中国之间的友好协会的声明，全文如下：
    关于拉丁美洲各国与中国之间的友好协会的声明
    我们这些参加中华人民共和国建国十一周年庆祝的拉丁美洲人士在北京聚会，并决定发表如下声明：
    1、我们各个代表团是代表不同政治倾向、职业和人类活动的；然而我们完全一致地认为，目前向帝国主义和封建落后作斗争和建设一个新中国的经验，对整个拉丁美洲具有特殊的意义。
    2、在我们回到各自的国家后，我们一定要宣传我们对中国的认识，但是我们知道，我们每个人对他所看到的事物都有各自不同的看法，因此，我们知道，待我们回到我们的各个国家之后，互相交流彼此要作的报告和宣传工作，将是十分令人感兴趣的事。
    3、除了在我们之间交流各人的报告以外，我们认为，为日益加强拉丁美洲各国对中国友好协会组织和增加它们彼此的联系的努力是最重要的。我们愿意以这样的形式播下在拉丁美洲成立一个拉丁美洲中国友好协会的种子，以便成为目前拉丁美洲各国已有的友好协会的协调组织。我们认为，帝国主义虽然一贯企图离间我们各国，然而对中国的友谊却有助于我们这些国家的团结。
    4、我们认为这个新的协会的会址应该设于“美洲自由的土地”—古巴。
    我们建议各代表团的团长们采取实际措施以便实现这些崇高的目的。　　　　1960年10月5日于北京
