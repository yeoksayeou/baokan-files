Anhui vigorously promotes rape square-block seedling cultivation.
Rape square-block seedling cultivation can cultivate strong seedlings, implement early planting, and achieve balanced yield increase; it can resolve the contradiction between early rape planting and late autumn crop stubble removal; and it can save labor, land, seeds, and fertilizer.
　　
Our newspaper Hefei, 8th dispatch: A rape square-block seedling cultivation method, which increases oil crop production in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, is being comprehensively promoted throughout Anhui Province. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that square-block seedling cultivation is an extremely important measure for implementing the policy of "planting more to harvest more" and "high yield to harvest more." Experience has proven that the square-block seedling cultivation method has ten major advantages over direct sowing: (1) It enables earlier planting. The Shengli (Victory) rape variety, which is widely used in Anhui Province this year, is better planted early rather than late, but this year many places have planted more late-autumn crops, so it is late to plant rape after the stubble is cleared. Implementing square-block seedling cultivation can resolve the contradiction between early rape sowing and late stubble clearing. (2) It saves seeds. In the past, spot sowing of rape required a catty or so of seeds per mu, while transplanting from square-block seedlings requires less than one or two liang per mu. If all planned rape planting in the province could implement square-block seedling cultivation, more than three million catties of seeds could be saved. (3) It saves labor. One mu of seedling cultivation can be transplanted to one hundred mu. Managing the seedlings for one hundred mu of rape by concentrating it on one mu of land saves a lot of labor. According to calculations, each mu of direct-sown rape requires twenty-six workdays from planting to harvest, while square-block seedling cultivated rape requires about sixteen and a half workdays from planting to harvest. (4) It can cultivate strong seedlings. Spot-sown rape seedlings are crowded and easily form "tall-leg seedlings"; square-block seedling cultivation with equidistant sowing can achieve strong seedlings for each plant. (5) It can guarantee full stands. Spot-sown rape is prone to missing seedlings; square-block seedling cultivation with soil transplanting, if done well, can ensure that every transplanted seedling lives, guaranteeing full stands. (6) It can adjust farm work. The rape sowing period coincides with the busy season of autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and late-autumn management. Changing rape direct sowing to square-block seedling cultivation, cultivating seedlings during busy times and transplanting during idle times, and cultivating seedlings on sunny days and transplanting on cloudy days, can stagger farm work and make work more proactive. (7) It saves fertilizer. With square-block seedling cultivation, fertilizer is used intensively, and its effectiveness is greater, and there is no scattering, which can save a lot of fertilizer compared to direct sowing. (8) It saves pesticides. Pest control during the seedling stage treats one mu as if it were one hundred mu, enabling timely treatment, and the problem of pesticides and machinery is easier to solve. (9) It saves land. Cultivating one mu of seedlings can free up ninety-nine mu of farmland for more than a month to grow other crops. (10) It can achieve balanced yield increases. Square-block seedling cultivation facilitates management and the elimination of three types of seedlings and late rape, increasing the yield of every plot of rape.

The method of rape square-block seedling cultivation is also relatively simple and easy to implement. Just select a place close to a water source with good drainage, compact the subsoil, lay fine sand, then lay one and a half inches of prepared nutrient soil, prepare the seedbed, divide it into squares, and then sow evenly. In square-block seedling cultivation, pay attention to matching the seedlings to the field to reduce transplanting labor. Sow the seeds as soon as the seedbed is ready, otherwise the ridge surface is easy to dry out, affecting rooting and establishment. The square-block seedling sowing device created in Anhui sows seeds evenly, two seeds per square, ensuring quality and high efficiency. Two people can sow one mu of seedbed in one and a half hours. It is being comprehensively promoted throughout the region.

In order to seize the opportunity and comprehensively promote the rape square-block seedling cultivation method, the Provincial Party Committee's Agricultural Work Department convened an on-site meeting in mid-September. Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made an important speech at the meeting, calling on all regions to vigorously promote the rape square-block seedling cultivation method. Subsequently, responsible comrades from various regions and counties personally made arrangements and immediately took action. Jiang Ke, First Secretary of the Feidong County Party Committee, and Zhang Jian, Secretary of the Secretariat, personally led technicians to the production teams to create "model fields," and convened an on-site meeting of more than 180 people, including the Party Committee secretaries and technicians of all communes in the county, to promote it. The county trained more than 2,000 technicians through the form of creating model fields and holding on-site meetings at all levels, and carried out square-block seedling cultivation work throughout the county.

### 安徽大力推广油菜方块育苗

    安徽大力推广油菜方块育苗
    油菜方块育苗，可以培育壮苗，实行早种，达到均衡增产；可以解决油菜早种和秋作物腾茬晚的矛盾；又可以节约劳力、土地、种子和肥料
    本报合肥8日电　一项多、快、好、省地增产油料作物的油菜方块育苗法，正在安徽省各地全面推广。中共安徽省委认为方块育苗是贯彻多种多收和高产多收方针的一项极为重要的措施。经验证明，方块育苗法比直播有十大好处：（1）能早栽。安徽省今年普遍采用的胜利油菜良种，播种宜早不宜迟，而今年各地晚秋作物种得多，等腾出茬口种油菜就晚了。实行方块育苗，油菜早播和茬口腾出过晚的矛盾就可以解决。（2）省种子。以往油菜点播，每亩要用斤把种，方块育苗移栽，每亩还合不到一两种。全省计划种植的油菜，如能全部实行方块育苗，就可节省出种子三百多万斤。（3）省劳力。育苗一亩，可栽一百亩。百亩油菜苗将苗期管理集中在一亩田里做，就很省工。据计算，从种到收，每亩直播油菜需要二十六个工，方块育苗的油菜从种到收约用十六个半工。（4）能培育壮苗。点播油菜，菜苗拥挤，容易形成“高脚苗”；方块育苗等距下子，能达到棵棵健壮。（5）能保证全苗。点播油菜容易缺苗；方块育苗，带土移栽，作得好能栽一棵活一棵，可以保证全苗。（6）能调剂农活。油菜播种期间，正值秋收秋种和晚秋管理的大忙季节，变油菜直播为方块育苗，忙时育苗闲时栽，晴天育苗阴天栽，就能把农活错开，工作比较主动。（7）省肥料。方块育苗，肥料集中使用，效力大，又一点不抛撒，比直播可以节省很多肥料。（8）省农药。苗期治虫，治一亩抵一百亩，能及时治，药械问题也好解决。（9）节约用地。育一亩苗，可以腾出九十九亩大田有一个多月的时间长其他庄稼。（10）能均衡增产。方块育苗便于管理，便于消灭三类苗和晚油菜，使块块油菜都增产。
    油菜方块育苗的办法也比较简单易行，只要选好靠水源近、排水好的地方打实底土、铺上细沙，再铺一寸半厚配制好的营养土，做好苗床，划成方格，然后均匀下种就行了。在方块育苗时，注意以苗就田，减少移栽人工，苗床做好后要随时播种，否则畦面容易晒干，影响扎根立苗。安徽创制的方块育苗播种器，下子均匀，每块二粒，保证质量，工效又高，两人使用，一小时半就可播种一亩苗床，各地正在全面推广。
    为了抓紧时机，全面推广油菜方块育苗办法，省委农工部在9月中旬曾召开了现场会议，省委第一书记曾希圣同志在会上作了重要指示，号召各地大力推广油菜方块育苗办法。接着，各地、县委负责同志都亲自布置，立即行动起来。中共肥东县委第一书记姜克、书记处书记张健，亲自带领技术员到生产队里去做了“样子田”，召开了全县各公社党委书记和技术员等一百八十多人的现场会议，进行推广。全县通过层层做样子田、开现场会的形式，培训了两千多个技术人员，在全县范围内开展了方块育苗工作。
