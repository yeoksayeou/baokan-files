Xinhua News Agency, Washington: The United States government is colluding with the West German government to jointly research "new methods" for manufacturing the main raw materials for nuclear weapons.

    State Department spokesman Tally confirmed on the 11th that since July of this year, the US government has been discussing with the West German government cooperation in "manufacturing and controlling" the centrifugal separator method, which West Germany is vigorously researching and is said to be able to produce enriched uranium cheaply. Tally said that the United States' work in this area is "confidential." He indicated that the United States is now asking the West German government to also take "security measures" so that the United States and West Germany can monopolize this method of manufacturing "materials for the production of atomic weapons" that is currently under research.

    A West German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the West German government agrees with the United States' opinion and has instructed the West German Patent Office to take the necessary measures. The spokesman also pointed out that West Germany has already sold a relevant device to the United States.

    美国西德勾结研究生产核武器原料
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府正在同西德政府勾结一道，共同研究制造核武器的主要原料的“新方法”。
    美国国务院发言人塔利11日证实，自从今年7月以来，美国政府一直同西德政府讨论合作“制造和控制”西德正在大力研究的据说可以用来廉价生产浓缩铀的离心分离机的方法。塔利说，美国在这方面的工作是“保密”的。他表明，美国现在正要求西德政府也采取“安全措施”，以便美国和西德能够垄断这种正在研究中的制造“生产原子武器的物质”的方法。
    西德外交部发言人说，西德政府同意美国的意见，并且已经责成西德专利局采取必要的措施。这个发言人还指出，西德已经把一个有关的装置卖给了美国。
