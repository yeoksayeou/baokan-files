    The Party Group of Section 301 of Fushun Paper Mill Fully Plays Its Core Role
    The group's five Communist Party members take the lead in everything, make friends with the masses, and care for them in every aspect from thought to life; they fully utilize the organizational roles of administration, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League to closely unite all 130 workers in the section around the Party group, ensuring a comprehensive and sustained leap forward in production.
    (Our report) According to the Liaoning Daily, the Party group of Section 301 of Workshop 603 of Fushun Paper Mill has fully played the core role of the Party organization among the masses, effectively promoting production. From January to September, the total output exceeded the plan by more than double, the quality reached the national advanced level, the cost was reduced by 35.1% compared with the plan, and the labor productivity increased by more than two times compared with the plan, achieving a comprehensive and sustained leap forward in production, becoming a red flag for grassroots Party groups in Fushun's industrial and mining enterprises.
    Section 301 has one hundred and thirty-two workers, of whom only five are Party members. However, these five Communist Party members, under the leadership of the workshop branch, have made extraordinary achievements. They united all the workers in the section like one person, forming an invincible and powerful force. Wherever the Party points, they rush. Many difficulties that people thought were insurmountable were overcome by them one after another.
    Under the leadership of the workshop branch, the Party group of Section 301 has consistently and conscientiously implemented the instructions and resolutions of the higher-level Party committee, actively mobilizing the masses to respond to all calls of the Party. Through the active activities of Party members, they implement the Party's resolutions, instructions, and calls among the masses, turning them into conscious actions of the masses. In order to solve the problem of insufficient raw materials, the factory Party committee called on all factory workers to vigorously engage in comprehensive utilization and use variegated cloth to produce high-grade paper. The Party group of Section 301 immediately responded. First, it convened a meeting of five Party members to unify their understanding and proposed five measures for trying to use variegated cloth. The next day, the Party group convened a meeting of advanced producers, activists, veteran workers, and team leaders to talk about the situation, assign tasks, and present the Party group's opinions and measures for everyone to discuss. After in-depth discussion, everyone reached a consensus and put forward many specific measures, supplementing the five methods proposed by the Party group. All the workers in the section said they would do it and immediately started experimenting, and the experiment was quickly successful.
    In order to extensively and deeply mobilize the masses and unite all the more than one hundred workers in the section around the Party, the Party group decided that each Party member should do political and ideological work and widely carry out "one lead" (that is, each Party member should set an example and play a leading role), "more friendship" (each Party member should make more close friends with employees through mutual heart-to-heart talks and mutual connections), and "four help" (each Party member should divide up the responsibilities and help workers improve their ideological awareness, arrange their lives well, study diligently, and work hard) activities. The five Party members were divided up according to the five production processes of material selection, cooking, washing and bleaching, pulping, and papermaking. They set an example in everything, consulted with the masses in case of trouble, took the lead in enduring hardship, and cared for the masses in every aspect from thought to life. The exemplary actions of Party members motivated and inspired the masses. Through individual connections and mutual heart-to-heart talks, each Party member made a large number of close friends. In addition, they gave full play to the roles of nineteen Communist Youth League members and more than forty activists, linking one to ten, ten to hundreds, and united all the workers in the section around the Party group. In addition, the Party group also mobilized Party members to conduct family visits. In July and August alone, five Party members, along with trade union group leaders and Communist Youth League branch secretaries, went to the dormitories of seventy-three employees' families and helped workers solve many life problems. Worker Chen Menghe and others were deeply moved and told everyone they met: "The Communist Party is even closer than our parents! Life problems are solved, we are happy, full of energy. From now on, I will definitely listen to the Party and work hard to thank the Party for its care!"
    In order to excellently complete the tasks assigned to the section by the Party branch, the Party group of this section paid special attention to the role of administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in its daily work. In addition to solving major problems in a timely and special manner, the Party group also insisted on holding a meeting of the Party group leader, administrative group leader, trade union group leader, and Communist Youth League group leader every day to promptly study and implement the Party branch's resolutions, unify steps, divide responsibilities, and solve problems in production. For example, in April, the successful trial production of high-grade paper using broken cottonseed was achieved, but because workers did not universally master the new technology, it could not be put into mass production quickly. The Party group convened a "four leaders" meeting to analyze the situation and deploy work. The administrative group immediately solved the two key issues of washing and bleaching equipment and operating methods; the trade union organized all the workers in the section to launch individual matching competitions and process collaboration competitions, raising red flags and establishing models widely, setting off a competition upsurge of learning, comparing, catching up, helping, and surpassing; the Communist Youth League group established youth supervision posts in various processes, calling on young workers to "learn from the advanced, help the backward, eliminate backwardness around the advanced, and make everyone a hero." The group also held meetings of veteran workers, young workers, and others according to the suggestions of the Party group to further explain the situation, assign tasks, and provide methods, so that the entire section cooperated wholeheartedly and worked hard for three days. Without steel and other materials, they made mechanical equipment, comprehensively promoted new operating methods, and solved a series of production technical problems, and soon produced high-grade paper from broken cottonseed.
    Because the Party group did the above series of political and ideological work, it greatly encouraged and united the masses, making the more than one hundred workers in the section united as one; the Party group enjoys extremely high prestige among the masses and is loved by all the workers in the section. The workers often say: "Our Party group has no difficulties that cannot be overcome!"

    抚顺造纸厂三零一工段党小组充分发挥核心作用
    小组五名共产党员，处处带头，和群众交知心朋友，从思想到生活处处关心群众；充分发挥行政、工会、共青团的组织作用，把全段一百三十多个工人都紧密团结在党小组周围。保证了生产全面持续跃进
    本报讯　据辽宁日报消息抚顺造纸厂六○三车间三○一工段党小组，充分发挥党组织在群众中的核心作用，有力地促进了生产。1月到9月，总产量超过计划一倍以上，质量达到全国先进水平，成本比计划降低35.1％，劳动生产率比计划提高两倍以上，实现了生产全面持续跃进，成为抚顺市工矿企业基层党小组的一面红旗。
    三○一工段有一百三十二名工人，其中只有五名党员，然而，就是这五名共产党员，在车间支部的领导下，作出了极不平凡的事迹。他们把全工段的工人团结得像一个人一样，结成了不可战胜的强大力量，党指向哪里就奔向哪里，很多被人们认为难以克服的困难，却被他们一个又一个的战胜了。
    在车间支部领导下，三○一工段党小组，一贯认真执行上级党的指示和决议，积极带动群众响应党的一切号召，并通过党员的积极活动，把党的决议、指示和号召贯彻到群众中去，变成群众的自觉行动。为了解决原料不足的问题，工厂党委号召全厂职工大搞综合利用，用杂色布生产高级纸。三○一工段党小组立即响应，首先召集五名党员开会，统一认识，提出了五项试用杂色布的措施。第二天党小组又召集先进生产者、积极分子、老工人、班组长开会，讲形势、交任务，把党小组的意见和措施交给大家讨论。经过深入讨论，大家认识一致了，提出了许多具体措施，补充了党小组提出的五项办法，全段工人说干就干，立刻试验，很快就试验成功了。
    为了普遍深入地发动群众，把全段百余名工人都团结到党的周围，党小组决定每个党员都做政治思想工作，广泛开展一带（即每个党员都以身作则、起模范带头作用）、多交（每个党员都通过互相谈心、互相串连，多和职工交知心朋友）、四帮（每个党员都分片包干，帮助工人提高思想觉悟、安排好生活、认真学习、努力生产）活动。五个党员按选料、蒸煮、洗漂、打浆、抄纸五个生产工序分片包干，他们事事起模范带头作用，遇事和群众商量，吃苦在前，从思想到生活处处关心群众。党员的模范行动带动和鼓舞了群众。通过个别串连、互相谈心，每个党员都交了大批知心朋友，再加上充分发挥了十九名共青团员和四十多名积极分子的作用，一连十、十连百，把全段工人都团结到党小组周围。此外，党小组还发动党员做家庭访问，仅7、8两月，五名党员和工会小组长、团支部书记等就深入到七十三户职工家属宿舍，帮助工人解决了许多生活问题，工人陈孟和等深受感动，见人就说：“共产党真是比父母还亲！生活问题解决了，心里高兴，满身是劲，今后我一定听党的话，好好干，感谢党的关怀！”
    为了出色地完成党支部交给工段的任务，这个工段的党小组在日常工作中特别注意发挥行政、工会、共青团组织的作用。除了重大问题及时专门解决外，党小组还每天坚持召开一次党小组长、行政小组长、工会小组长、团小组长的碰头会议，及时研究贯彻执行党支部的决议，统一步调，分工负责，解决生产中的问题。例如，4月里，试用破籽棉造高级纸成功、但由于工人没有普遍掌握新技术，不能迅速大批投入生产。党小组就召开“四长会议，分析了情况，部署了工作。行政小组立即解决了洗漂设备、操作方法两大关键；工会组织全段工人展开个人对口赛、工序协作赛，大插红旗，广树标兵，掀起学比赶帮超的竞赛潮热；共青团小组在各个工序建立了青年监督岗，号召青工们“一人先进大家学，一人落后大家帮，先进周围无落后，英雄左右皆好汉”。这个小组还根据党小组的建议分别召开老工人、青年工人等会议，进一步讲形势、交任务、交办法，使全段同心协力，大干三天，在无钢铁等材料的情况下，制成了机械设备，全面推广了新操作方法，解决了一系列的生产技术问题，很快就用破籽棉生产出了高级纸。
    由于党小组做了上述一系列的政治思想工作，极大地鼓舞和团结了群众，使全段一百多名工人团结得一条心、一股劲；党小组在群众中享有极高的威信，受到全段工人的爱戴、工人们常说：我们党小组没有克服不了的困难！”
