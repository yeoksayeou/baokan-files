Meritorious Shoes (Clapper Talk)
Nanchong City, Sichuan Central Petroleum Mining Bureau, Li Shaobai

	Bamboo shadows sway, water bends and turns,
	Along the river, drilling towers prop up the blue sky.
	A great man walks out of the mountain bend,
	Born with thick arms and a round waist,
	Thick eyebrows and big eyes, a square face,
	He is the oil extraction driver, Zhang Jinchuan.
	Wearing an aluminum helmet, shining silver,
	Dressed in an old army shirt,
	His leather shoes are torn with several holes,
	Looks like he's worn them for at least six or seven years.
	People say: "You should change these shoes."
	He laughs: "I can't bear to part with them, they're sentimental to me.
	In Korea, climbing ice and lying in snow, they kept me warm,
	After demobilization, they followed me searching for oil, treading thousands of mountains.
	My footprints leave so many memories,
	How can I throw them away now!
	Every time I take them to the shoe repair shop,
	Fix them up and wear them for another year."
	Today, after getting off the night shift at nine o'clock,
	He's the only one left in the team.
	Hurrying to the canteen for breakfast,
	He runs into the communication clerk,
	Who calls out to Old Zhang from afar:
	"Oh dear! I've been looking for you for half the day.
	Your wife has arrived at the station,
	Cowherd, hurry and meet the Weaver Girl!"
	Zhang Jinchuan's heart leaps upon hearing this,
	He wishes he could fly to the station immediately,
	He and his wife haven't seen each other in three years,
	This time she took leave specifically to see Jinchuan.
	Zhang Jinchuan strides towards the station,
	The communication clerk tugs at his sleeve and says:
	"Look at your body covered in crude oil, black and smeared,
	Your wife won't like it."
	Zhang Jinchuan turns his head and says, "Don't talk nonsense,
	Old husband and wife will understand."
	Turning around, he heads for the bus station,
	Dashing as swiftly as an arrow leaving the string.
	Climbing slopes, crossing streams, taking the straight path,
	He arrives at the great plain before him.
	Hey! Red flags wave in the wind all over the fields,
	Autumn plowing songs fill the air;
	Huh? Why is someone shouting by the river,
	Calling out "Technician" over and over again.
	A young man, his brow furrowed and face bitter,
	What's the urgent matter that's troubling him?
	Zhang Jinchuan passes by and takes a look:
	Oh! The water pump is lying lazily by the river,
	Screws and parts all disassembled,
	A pile of tools laid out.
	The young man sighs:
	"Alas, when it's needed, we can't find our commune
	Technician,
	If we can't pump water, we'll be very worried,
	And we don't know what the problem is!"
	Hearing this is like a steel rope entangling a swiftly flying arrow,
	Zhang Jinchuan forgets his wife on the station side.
	Next year's spring planting must increase production,
	Relying entirely on timely autumn sowing,
	If the water pump is paralyzed,
	How will the commune members plow the fields?
	The Party calls on everyone to support the agricultural front,
	How can I stand by and watch without helping?
	Zhang Jinchuan says, "Let me give it a try."
	He squats down and gets to work immediately.
	Rolling up his trouser legs, he checks the suction pipe in the river,
	Rolling up his sleeves, he wrenches on the cylinder screws,
	Sweat pours down like rain,
	Finally finding the problem is with the piston.
	The small piston is of poor quality and the leather is too soft,
	Plus it's cut unevenly,
	Pumping is intermittent,
	Water leaks badly, unable to seal properly.
	Zhang Jinchuan quickly calls out to the young man:
	"Hurry and find some good leather rings."
	The young man says: "It's not easy,
	The rubber at the farm tool factory has all been used up."
	How to solve this crucial issue?
	Zhang Jinchuan suddenly becomes worried.
	He scratches his head, looking for a solution,
	Suddenly an idea comes to mind.
	He sits down on the riverbank,
	Picks up a screwdriver and pries off his shoe heel,
	Click, click, click, prying off three or four pieces of leather,
	Chop, chop, chop, cutting them into nine small leather rings.
	The young farmer is stunned,
	Realizing it, trying to stop him is futile,
	He can't help but admiringly exclaim:
	"You truly are a good example of selflessness and serving the collective!"
	Zhang Jinchuan seems not to hear,
	Focusing all his attention on installing the piston,
	Then he presses the switch,
	The water pump sputters and smokes,
	A torrent of clear spring water flies ashore,
	Laughing and rushing into the good fields.
	Zhang Jinchuan stretches and wipes away a handful of sweat –
	Suddenly remembering his wife waiting for him, her eyes piercing him,
	Seeing that it's almost twelve o'clock,
	Now he can't delay any longer,
	Waving his hand, he says to the young man, "Goodbye, goodbye!"
	Hurrying away like a wisp of smoke.
	The young farmer chases after him, inviting him to lunch,
	He keeps saying, "No need to bother."
	With one shoe high and one low, he hurries down the road,
	In a flash, he arrives at the station.
	...

    功劳鞋（金钱板）
    南充市川中石油矿务局　李绍白竹影摇摇水弯弯，沿江钻塔撑蓝天，山弯里走出一大汉，生得膀粗腰又圆，浓眉大眼方方脸，他就是采油司机张锦川。头戴铝盔银光闪，身穿一件旧军衫，皮鞋烂了好几个眼，看样子起码穿了六七年。人家说：“你这鞋子也该换一
  换。”他笑道：“我跟它难舍难丢有
  情缘，在朝鲜爬冰卧雪它保暖，转业后又随我寻找石油踏千
  山。脚印里留下我多少纪念，到如今怎能把它扔一边！每次拿到补鞋店，修修补补又穿一年。”今日里下了夜班已九点，全班就剩他一人在后边，急忙忙赶往食堂吃早饭，迎面碰上了通讯员，隔好远就把老张喊：“哎呀呀！害得我找你大半
  天。你的爱人到车站，牛郎呃，快快去接织女仙！”张锦川一听心如箭，恨不得立刻飞到车站前，他夫妻已经三年未见面，这次请假特来看锦川。张锦川迈步就往车站赶，通讯员拽着袖子开了言：“看你这满身原油黑花脸，爱人看了不喜欢。”张锦川回头说声“莫扯蛋，老夫老妻会包涵。”扭身就奔汽车站，飕飕地跑得就像箭离弦。爬坡跨涧走直线，眼前来到大平原。嘿！遍野红旗迎风展，秋耕歌声闹翻天；咦？怎么江边有人喊，声声呼叫“技术员”。一青年愁眉又苦脸，有啥子急事他为了难？张锦川路过跟前用眼看：呀！抽水机懒洋洋地躺在河边，螺丝零件都拆散，工具摆了一大摊。这青年唉声把气叹：“嗨，到时候偏偏找不着咱社
  技术员，抽不上水来真把心急烂，又不知毛病到底在哪端！”听此言就像钢绳缠住急飞箭，张锦川早把爱人忘到脑后边，明年大春要增产，全靠秋种及时完，抽水机如果成瘫痪，社员们咋个犁坂田？党号召大家都要支援农业战
  线，我怎能见急不救袖手旁观。张锦川说声：“我来试试看。”顺势蹲下就干得欢。卷裤筒下河检查吸水管，挽袖子又把气缸螺丝扳，只累得汗珠簌簌如雨点，才找到毛病出在活塞间。小活塞质量不好皮太软，再加上剪得又不圆，抽起来上气不接下气常中断，哗哗漏水堵不严。张锦川忙把青年喊：“你快去找几个好皮圈。”这青年连说：“不好办，农具厂里的胶皮早用完。”咋个解决这一关键？顿时急坏了张锦川，他抓耳搔腮寻主见，猛然一计上心间。一屁股坐到河岸畔，拿起螺丝刀就把鞋跟掀，咔咔咔，撬下牛皮三四片，嚓嚓嚓，剪成九个小皮圈。青年农民一旁怔了眼，明白后再去阻止也枉然，他不禁感动得连声赞叹：“你真是舍己为群的好标杆！”张锦川好像没听见，全神贯注在把活塞安，紧接着就把开关按，抽水机突突突突冒了烟，大股清泉飞上岸，哗哗笑着进良田。张锦川伸腰吁气揩了一把汗——猛想起爱人等他眼望穿，看时间快到十二点，如今再也莫迟延，扬着手对青年说声“再见，再
  见！”急匆匆跑得就像一溜烟。青年农民撵着留他吃午饭，他连说“不必添麻烦。”两只鞋一高一低把路赶，霎时便到车站前。……
