All Sectors Vigorously Support the Agricultural Front
Jilin City Strengthens Technical Forces for Large-Scale Agriculture

    (Our report) The mass movement of industry and all sectors in Jilin City to support agriculture has further strengthened the forces for agricultural technical transformation.
    With the support of industry and all sectors, Jilin City's rural areas have initially established an agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing network. The machinery factories in various counties have been further improved in terms of technology and equipment; more than 80% of the communes have established agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing factories with two to nine machine tools and various tools, based on the original iron and wood farm tool factories; nearly 70% of the management districts have established iron and wood farm tool factories with various tools. This has made rural machinery industry complete in terms of technology, equipment, power, and other aspects. In the past six months, Jilin City's rural areas have newly built seventy small-scale power stations, erected nearly two hundred kilometers of power lines, and achieved low-standard electrification in more than one hundred and ten management districts. More than three thousand rural machinery and electrical workers have been trained for the communes, further strengthening the rural technical force.
    The mass movement of industry and all sectors in Jilin City to support agriculture began last winter. Adapting to the agricultural production season, it has experienced three climaxes; currently, a fourth, larger-scale climax centered on supporting the autumn harvest has been launched. In March of this year, the Jilin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the experience of the first climax and organized 108 industrial and mining enterprises in the city to establish "pairing" relationships with 72 people's communes in the suburbs and five counties under the jurisdiction of Jilin City. It was also determined to start from solving the current shortage of rural labor and promoting agricultural production, combining "treating the urgent" and "treating the root cause," and focusing on supporting agricultural technical transformation, so that the goal of the industrial support agriculture movement was clear and could be carried out comprehensively and persistently. According to preliminary statistics, in the first seven months of this year, in addition to allocating a large amount of agricultural production materials to the rural areas in accordance with the state plan, the city also rushed to produce more than 17,000 various agricultural machinery and more than 1,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, more than 90 tons of pesticides, and mobilized more than 1.7 million workdays, powerfully supporting agricultural production. At the same time, the city also actively helped rural areas establish county and commune machinery industries, especially comprehensively helping communes arm themselves with "three machine tools" (lathe, drilling machine, planer) and "five tools" (taps and dies, pliers, hacksaw, steel file, hand drill).
    Jilin City originally had a weak foundation in the machinery industry, and the conditions for supporting rural areas in arming the machinery industry were not superior. However, under the unified leadership of the Jilin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, various factories and mines organized the weak and scattered forces, realizing the slogan of "every factory provides support, every shift makes a contribution, and everyone puts in their strength." The machinery industry departments re-paired and re-equipped old machinery and equipment, and tapped potential to rush to produce simple machinery and equipment to vigorously support agriculture. Non-machinery industry departments, such as Jilin Chemical Industry Company, also used their own machine repair personnel as the backbone, organized forces from all aspects, and tried every means to support agriculture. The company has supported rural areas with more than 140 machine tools and equipment. Jiaohe County originally had only one commune machinery factory equipped with "three machine tools and five tools," but soon after, twelve communes quickly established "three machine tools and five tools" with the comprehensive help of various factories of Jilin Chemical Industry Company. In the process of supporting agriculture, "find materials yourself if you don't have them, make tools yourself if you don't have them, and work on it in your spare time if you don't have time" and "do what you can and respond to every request" have become the action slogans of the city's vast number of employees. With the support of industry-led sectors, the people's communes in Jilin City reformed and manufactured more than 240 types and 97,100 pieces of new field production tools from spring plowing to summer weeding, adding many medium and small-sized new agricultural machines for sowing, transplanting, hoeing and logistics. These new tools not only increased unprecedentedly in variety and quantity, but also had higher efficiency due to their full integration with local farming characteristics. The city's rural areas saved approximately 50,000 laborers through tool reform.
    Currently, the city's rural people's communes are vigorously developing water-powered stations and building threshing tools on a large scale. They are making full use of the favorable conditions of urban support for rural areas, working hard to strive to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of threshing in this year's autumn harvest. A large number of water turbines, universal threshing machines, power rice threshers, corn threshers, winnowing machines, and straw chopping machines that have already been manufactured have increased efficiency by more than ten times. The power stations distributed in various production teams are matched into complete sets, which greatly shortens the time and improves the quality of threshing operations. Because the communes have enhanced their ability to manufacture and maintain agricultural machinery, a large number of laborers have been saved, better implementing the agricultural production policy of taking grain as the key link and developing in an all-round way. Chaluhe Commune in Yongji County, through the 320,000 workdays saved by tool reform during spring sowing and summer weeding, expanded grain crops by more than 12,500 mu, and newly built more than 160 pig farms, 143 chicken farms, and more than 7,500 mu of orchards.
    With the machinery industry in the communes, it is more convenient to develop other industries serving agricultural production. Since the beginning of this year, the development of commune-run factories producing chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and processing agricultural and sideline products in Jilin City's rural areas has been even faster. Some commune repair and manufacturing factories in Panshi, Yongji, and other counties have also made their own lathes and planers for management districts to arm mechanical repair stations. The formation of the rural machinery repair and manufacturing network and its role in agricultural construction has promoted the more consolidated and sound development of rural people's communes, enabling farmers to see the prospects of modern agriculture more concretely, and enhancing their determination and strength to vigorously develop agriculture, vigorously develop grain, and support national construction.

    各行各业大力支援农业战线
    吉林市增强大办农业的技术力量
    本报讯　吉林市工业和各行各业支援农业的群众运动，进一步增强了农业技术改造的力量。
    在工业和各行各业的支援下，吉林市农村已初步建成农业机械修造网。各县机械厂，在技术、设备上进一步得到完善；占80％以上的公社，在原有铁木农具厂的基础上，建立了具备二台到九台机床和各种工具的农业机械修造厂；将近70％的管理区建立了具备各种工具的铁木农具厂。使农村机械工业从技术、设备、动力等各方面搭配成套。半年多来，吉林市农村共新建小型电站七十处，架设线路近二百公里，一百一十多个管理区实现了低标准电气化。为公社培养出来的农村机械、电气工人共达三千多名，进一步壮大了农村技术队伍。
    吉林市的工业和各行各业支援农业的群众运动，从去年冬季开始，适应农业生产季节，已经历了三个高潮；目前又掀起了一个规模更大的以支援秋收为中心的第四次高潮。今年3月，中共吉林市委总结了第一次高潮中的经验，组织全市一百零八个工矿企业，分别和吉林市所属郊区和五个县的七十二个人民公社建立了“挂钩”关系。并确定从解决当前农村劳力不足和促进农业生产出发、“治急”和“治本”紧密相结合，以支援农业技术改造为重点的方针，使工业支援农业的运动目标明确，全面持久地开展起来。据初步统计，全市在今年头七个月里，除了按照国家计划下拨农村大量农业生产资料外，又赶制出一万七千多台各种农业机械和一千多吨化肥，九十多吨农药，动员一百七十多万个工日，有力地支援了农业生产。与此同时，全市还积极帮助农村建立了县、社机械工业，特别是全面帮助公社武装了“三床”（车、钻、刨床）“五具”（丝锥板牙、老虎钳子、钢锯、钢锉、手摇钻）。
    吉林市原有机械工业基础较薄弱，支援农村武装机械工业的条件并不优越。但是，各厂矿在中共吉林市委的统一领导下，将薄弱和分散的力量组织起来，实现了“厂厂有支援，班班有贡献，人人出力量”的口号。机械工业部门将废旧的机械设备重新修配起来，并大挖潜力，特地赶制简易机械设备，大力支援农业。非机械工业部门，如吉林化学工业公司等单位，也以本部门的机修人员为骨干，组织各方面的力量，千方百计地支援农业。该公司已经支援农村的机床、设备共达一百四十多台。蛟河县原来只有一个公社机械厂具备“三床五具”，但不久以后，即有十二个公社在吉林化学工业公司各工厂的全面帮助下，迅速建立了“三床五具”。在支援农业的过程中，“没有材料自己找，没有工具自己造，没有时间工余搞”和“力所能及，有求必应”，已成为全市广大职工的行动口号。在以工业为主的各行各业的支援下，吉林市农村人民公社从春耕到夏锄期间，共改革制造了二百四十多种、九万七千一百多件田间生产新工具，增添了许多播种、插秧、铲趟和后勤等中、小型新式农业机具。这些新工具，不仅在种类和数量上空前增多，而且由于充分结合当地耕作特点，使用效率较高。全市农村通过工具改革，约节省了五万个劳动力。
    目前，全市农村人民公社正在大办水动力站和大造脱谷工具。他们充分利用城市支援农村的有利条件，发愤图强，决心争取今年秋收中实现脱谷机械化和半机械化。现在，已经制成的大批水轮机、万能脱谷机、动力打稻机、玉米脱粒机、扬场机、乱草机等，效率提高十几倍。使分布在各个生产队的动力站配合成套，使脱谷作业，大大缩短时间，提高了质量。由于各公社增强了农业机械的制造和维修能力，因此节省出大批劳动力，更好地贯彻以粮为纲全面发展的农业生产方针。永吉县岔路河公社，在春播和夏锄期间，通过工具改革所节省的三十二万多个劳动日，除扩大粮食作物一万二千五百多亩外，还新建养猪场一百六十多个，养鸡场一百四十三个，果木园七千五百多亩。
    公社有了机械工业后，发展其他为农业生产服务的工业也更方便。今年以来，吉林市农村生产化肥、农药和加工农副产品的社办工厂发展更快。磐石、永吉等县有些公社修造厂，还自制车床和刨床，供管理区武装机械修配站。农村机械修造网的形成和它在农业建设中所发挥的作用，促进了农村人民公社更加巩固健全地向前发展，使农民更具体地看到现代化农业的前途，增强了大办农业，大办粮食，支援国家建设的决心和力量。（附图片）
