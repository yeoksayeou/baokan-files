Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The People's Liberation Army (PLA) across the country is widely carrying out activities to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, learning from the Volunteer Army's heroic and tenacious spirit, hard work, and patriotism and internationalism.

In the past two days, PLA units in various regions have held report meetings, with unit leaders or former Volunteer Army heroes giving reports. In every company, there is an atmosphere of joy and learning from the Volunteer Army. Soldiers held discussion meetings and story-telling evenings about the Volunteer Army; some also held photo exhibitions and published special editions of wall newspapers and blackboards to commemorate the tenth anniversary of "October 25th." The broad masses of commanders and fighters are determined to take the Volunteer Army as their model and always be the most beloved people in the cause of defending socialism and building the motherland.

In the past two days, the former Volunteer Army heroes from various PLA units have taken out the medals and awards given by the Korean government and hung them on their chests, shining brightly. Many company soldiers invited these heroes to visit the platoons and squads to talk about the glorious traditions and fine style of the Volunteer Army. The former commander of the Shangganling Hero Regiment of the Volunteer Army reported to the officers and soldiers of the PLA General Headquarters on the heroic deeds in the Battle of Shangganling. Senior Colonel Su Kezhi, commander of the Huangcaoling battle of the former Volunteer Army, Senior Colonel Wei Huajie, former commander of the Volunteer Army regiment who led his troops to break through the 38th parallel, and many combat heroes and special-class meritorious personnel, told the officers and soldiers about their personal combat experiences.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army's arduous and victorious deeds in overcoming difficulties, like the history of hard struggle of the old Red Army and old Eighth Route Army, have become the most vivid and practical teaching material for educating the troops. The soldiers of the famous railway corps "Yang Lian Di Company," who are building railways on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, held a discussion meeting at the construction site. Everyone talked about the situation of the former Volunteer Army railway corps repairing railways on the battlefield: enemy planes bombed in front, and they repaired behind, often risking heavy smoke and fire, filling bomb craters to build roadbeds, and repairing bridge piers to erect large bridges. Sometimes, they risked their lives to remove time bombs dropped by enemy planes. The soldiers of the "Yang Lian Di Company" said: We must use the heroic spirit of the Volunteer Army in repairing railways on the Korean battlefield to build railways for the motherland. Yu Keliang, captain of a naval vessel in Lushun-Dalian, and the sailors braved the strong cold wind at sea and discussed the spirit of hard struggle of the Volunteer Army on the warship. They talked about: the Volunteer Army marched and fought in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius. If they had no houses to live in, they slept in the snow; if they had no water to drink, they quenched their thirst with snow. Sailor Liu Dianwen said that we sailors must also be trained into good iron men in the wind, waves and severe cold to defend the sacred sea frontier of our motherland.

During the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of "October 25th," many commanders and fighters of the troops also wrote articles for military newspapers and wrote letters to the Korean People's Army, expressing their desire to learn from the Korean People's Army and to join hands with the Korean People's Army, just like the Volunteer Army who went abroad to fight in those years, to defend peace in Asia and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 26th: The army and people on the Fujian front have launched various activities in recent days to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

Since the 24th, the heroic city of Xiamen on the coastal defense front has been decorated with red flags. Many troops, government offices, schools, and public places have displayed huge banners such as "Respect to the heroic Korean people," "Learn from the heroic fighting spirit of the Volunteer Army, oppose U.S. imperialist aggression, and defend world peace," and "Long live the militant friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples forged in blood." Many former Volunteer Army heroes have been invited to report to the PLA officers and soldiers, militiamen, and people from all walks of life in Xiamen, who are vigilantly guarding the coastal defense day and night. They used their personal experiences to vividly expose the essentially weak nature of U.S. imperialism as a paper tiger. Jian Haijin, a former second-class hero of the Volunteer Army and recipient of the second-class warrior honor medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, reported to more than 1,300 teachers, students, and staff of Xiamen No. 1 Middle School about the heroic deeds of him and his two comrades who fought on a certain highland in Korea, continuously defeated four frantic enemy attacks, and firmly held the position. The audience frequently excitedly shouted the slogan "Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army." After the meeting, the students expressed their determination to learn from the Volunteer Army's heroic and tenacious spirit. On the 25th, faculty and student representatives from Xiamen University and more than ten former Volunteer Army soldiers studying at the school sat together and held a discussion. The student representatives present unanimously expressed their intention to learn from the Volunteer Army's patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism, and contribute their efforts to the socialist construction of the motherland and world peace.

    这两天来，解放军各部队的前志愿军英雄们，都拿出朝鲜政府授予的勋章和奖章，金光闪闪地挂在胸前。许多连队战士，都请这些英雄们到排和班里作客，讲志愿军的光荣传统和优良作风。前志愿军上甘岭英雄团团长向解放军总部直属队机关的官兵报告了上甘岭战役中的英雄事迹。前志愿军黄草岭战斗的指挥员苏克之大校、曾率领部队突破三八线的前志愿军团长魏化杰上校以及许多战斗英雄、特等功臣，都向部队官兵讲述了亲身的战斗经历。
    中国人民志愿军的艰苦卓绝、战胜困难的胜利事迹，像过去老红军、老八路的艰苦奋斗史一样，成了教育部队的最生动、最实际的教材。正在云贵高原修筑铁路的著名的铁道兵“杨连第连”的战士们，在工地上开了座谈会。大家谈到了前志愿军铁道兵部队在战场上抢修铁路的情形：敌机在前边轰炸，他们在后边抢修，时常冒着浓烟烈火，填平弹坑筑路基，修复桥桩架大桥。有时候，他们冒着生命危险，搬走敌机丢下的定时炸弹。“杨连第连”的战士们表示：要以志愿军在朝鲜战场上抢修铁路的英雄气概，为祖国修建铁路。旅大海军某舰舰长喻克良和水兵们，冒着海上的强劲冷风，在军舰上座谈了志愿军的艰苦奋斗精神。他们谈到：志愿军在零下三十度严寒天气行军作战，没有房子住，就睡在雪地里；没有水喝，就饮雪止渴。水兵刘殿文说，我们水兵也要在风浪和严寒中锻炼成铁打的好汉，保卫我们祖国的神圣海疆。
    许多部队的指战员还在纪念“十·二五”十周年中，给军队报纸写文章，给朝鲜人民军写信，要向朝鲜人民军学习，并表示要和当年出国作战的志愿军一样，与朝鲜人民军并肩携手，捍卫亚洲与世界和平。
