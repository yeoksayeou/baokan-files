Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 6th: According to a communiqué issued by the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, a counter-revolutionary armed group of twenty-seven men, carrying the American flag, landed at Navas Bay, between Moa Bay and Baracoa in Oriente Province, on the morning of the 5th. Three of these bandits who came to invade from the United States were Americans.

The communiqué stated that after receiving a report from farmers, the Rebel Army immediately cooperated with the farmer militia to wipe out the invaders, killing the bandit leader Amentino Feria, capturing two people, and the others "will not escape the suppression by the Rebel Army and the farmer militia in this area." The killed Feria used to be the head of the "Masferrer" Tiger Squad, a terrorist organization specializing in assassinations during the Batista dictatorship, and was notorious for committing many crimes in Oriente Province. Arturo Alvarez, a former soldier of the dictatorship who was captured, is a counter-revolutionary fugitive with three murder cases. The two prisoners are being interrogated by the Rebel Army.

The communiqué stated that in addition to seizing the American flag carried by the counter-revolutionaries, they also seized three donkeys carrying seven M-1 carbines, US Army regulations, and other documents.

The communiqué also stated that after landing, the bandits kidnapped nearly fifty farmers, who provided information to the Rebel Army after escaping.

The communiqué issued by the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces pointed out: "The revolutionary government is paying close attention to the blatant activities that imperialism has been continuously carrying out in recent weeks, the purpose of which is to instigate counter-revolutionary riots, terrorist activities, assassinations, and other conspiracies of all kinds at all costs, in order to curb the development of the Cuban revolution. These activities have become even more rampant after the Cuban Prime Minister made a condemnation at the United Nations." The communiqué finally warned that "the Rebel Army, the revolutionary militia, and the people will use all their strength to fight against the traitors of the motherland, and the criminals who serve the enemies of the country will be severely punished by law, and those American mercenaries who dare to invade our territory with weapons will be given even more severe sanctions."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 6th: The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" revealed today that US imperialists are carrying out various conspiracies in Guatemala to launch an armed attack on Cuba.

The newspaper reported that in Puerto Barrios, Guatemala, ships of all sizes, ready to be used to attack Cuba, have been concentrated. At the same time, at several airports in Guatemala, thirty-six "Globemaster" transport planes sent by the United States, as well as a large number of bombers and reconnaissance planes, have been prepared to participate in military operations to attack Cuba.

Referring to the recent incident of Guatemalan planes attacking the so-called "Cuban speedboat," the newspaper pointed out that the purpose of creating this incident was to create an excuse for the preparations for aggression against Cuba being carried out in Guatemala. The Guatemalan authorities spread lies, insisting that the speedboat was trying to transport weapons into Guatemala.

The Cuban "July 26th Movement" today condemned the US State Department for treating Cuban war criminals like honored guests. These counter-revolutionaries under American protection are increasingly attacking Cuban patriots residing in the United States. The "July 26th Movement" condemned that in Miami, USA, Cuban counter-revolutionaries, under the protection of the US authorities, attacked the "Paula" restaurant owned by a Cuban patriot because he hung a portrait of Prime Minister Castro on the wall of the restaurant. "Revolución" published photos of the restaurant windows being shot by these counter-revolutionaries. The newspaper pointed out that similar atrocities have also occurred in New York and Tampa, Florida. (Attached picture)

    古巴军民合力清剿侵犯者  歼灭一股来自美国的匪徒
    “今日报”揭露美国在危地马拉策划武装进攻古巴
    据新华社哈瓦那6日电　据古巴革命武装部发表的公报说，一股由二十七人组成的反革命武装5日清晨打着美国国旗，在奥连特省莫亚湾和巴拉科阿之间的纳瓦斯湾登陆。这股从美国前来进犯的匪徒中有三个美国人。
    公报说，起义军在接获农民的报告后，立即协同农民民兵前往清剿，击毙匪首阿门蒂诺·费里亚，俘虏两人，其他的人“也逃脱不了这个地区的起义军和农民民兵的镇压”。被击毙的费里亚过去是巴蒂斯塔独裁统治时期的专门从事暗杀的恐怖组织“马斯费雷尔”老虎队的头目，曾在奥连特省犯有许多罪行而恶名昭彰。被俘的前独裁政权的士兵阿图罗·阿耳瓦雷斯，是有三条人命案的反革命逃犯。这两名俘虏正在由起义军审问中。
    公报说，除了缴获了反革命分子打着的美国国旗外，还缴获了载运七支M—1型卡宾枪、美国陆军条例和其他文件的三头毛驴。
    公报还说，匪徒在登陆后，曾绑架了近五十名农民，这些农民在脱逃后向起义军部队提供了情报。
    古巴革命武装部发表的公报指出：“革命政府非常注意帝国主义在最近几个星期不断进行的明目张胆的活动，这些活动的目的是要不惜一切代价策动反革命暴乱、恐怖活动、谋杀以及其他形形色色的阴谋，以遏制古巴革命发展的进程。这些活动在古巴总理在联合国提出谴责以后是更加猖獗了。”公报最后警告说，“起义军、革命民兵和人民将用一切力量对祖国的叛徒作战，为国家的敌人效劳的罪犯将受到法律的严厉制裁，对那些胆敢拿着武器侵犯我国领土的美国雇佣兵则将给予更加严厉的制裁。”
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　古巴
  “今日报”今天揭露，美帝国主义者正在危地马拉进行各种阴谋活动，准备对古巴发动武装进攻。
    这家报纸报道，在危地马拉的巴里奥斯港，已经集中了准备用来进攻古巴的大小船只。同时，在危地马拉的几个飞机场上，三十六架美国派去的“全球霸王式”运输机以及大批轰炸机和侦察机已经作好参加进攻古巴的军事行动的准备。
    这家报纸在谈到最近发生的危地马拉飞机攻击所谓“古巴快艇”的事件时指出，制造这次事件的目的，是为在危地马拉进行的侵略古巴的准备活动制造借口。危地马拉当局曾经散布谎言，硬说这只快艇企图把武器运进危地马拉。
    古巴“七月二十六日运动”今天谴责美国国务院待古巴战犯如同上宾，这些在美国庇护下的反革命分子正在日益猖獗地攻击侨居美国的古巴爱国者。“七月二十六日运动”谴责说，在美国的迈阿密，古巴反革命分子在美国当局庇护下，攻击了一位古巴爱国者所拥有的“鲍拉”饭店，因为他在饭店的墙上悬挂着卡斯特罗总理像。“革命报”刊登了饭店窗户遭到这些反革命分子枪击的照片。报纸指出，这类暴行还曾经在纽约和佛罗里达州的坦巴发生。（附图片）
