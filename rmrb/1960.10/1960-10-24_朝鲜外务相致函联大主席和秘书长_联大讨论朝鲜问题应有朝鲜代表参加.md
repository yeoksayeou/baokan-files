Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 23rd: DPRK Foreign Minister Pak Sung Chul wrote to UN General Assembly President Boland and UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 22nd, regarding the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Korean question. He pointed out that the DPRK government representatives, as parties concerned in the Korean question, must participate in the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Korean question. This is the due right and legitimate demand of the DPRK.

The letter stated that for the past thirteen years, under the coercive demands of the United States, the United Nations has illegally included the Korean question, which should be resolved by the Korean people themselves, on the agenda. It has also unilaterally conducted discussions without the participation of the DPRK representatives, who are parties concerned in the Korean question, and mechanically adopted illegal "resolutions" that have no practical significance. All of this has been in vain.

Pak Sung Chul hopes that this letter will be immediately distributed to the representatives of all member states of the United Nations and that he will be informed of the result.

    朝鲜外务相致函联大主席和秘书长
    联大讨论朝鲜问题应有朝鲜代表参加
    新华社平壤23日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴成哲22日就联合国大会讨论朝鲜问题写信给本届联大主席博兰和联大秘书长哈马舍尔德指出，本届联合国大会讨论朝鲜问题，必须有作为朝鲜问题的当事人朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表参加，这是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的应有的权利和正当的要求。
    这封信说，联合国在过去十三年间根据美国的强制要求，一直把应由朝鲜人民自己来解决的朝鲜问题非法地列入了议程，并在没有朝鲜问题的当事人——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表的参加下，片面地进行了讨论，机械地通过了没有任何实践意义的非法的“决议”，这都是徒劳的。
    朴成哲希望把这封信立即分发给联合国成员国的各国代表并把结果告诉他。
