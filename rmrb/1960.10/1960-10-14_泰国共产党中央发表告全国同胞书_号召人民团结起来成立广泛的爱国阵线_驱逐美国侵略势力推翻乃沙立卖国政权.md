Xinhua News Agency, October 13th, Bangkok: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand recently issued a letter to all Thai compatriots, calling on people from all walks of life in Thailand to establish a broad patriotic front, unite, expel the aggressive forces of American imperialism, overthrow the Thanom Kittikachorn traitorous and dictatorial regime, and establish a government that implements a truly independent, neutral, peaceful, and democratic policy.

The letter to compatriots announced that in order to overthrow Thanom Kittikachorn's traitorous and dictatorial rule and expel the aggressive forces of American imperialism from Thailand, the Communist Party of Thailand welcomes cooperation with all patriotic and democratic individuals, people from all walks of life, and all parties.

The letter to compatriots said: In order to establish a broad patriotic front, the Communist Party of Thailand puts forward four policy proposals as the foundation for national unity and cooperation. These policies are: 1. Overthrow the Thanom Kittikachorn traitorous and dictatorial rule, expel the aggressive forces of American imperialism, and establish a government that implements a truly independent, neutral, peaceful, and democratic policy. 2. Abolish the policy of following American imperialism, withdraw from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, abolish all treaties that bind and undermine national sovereignty, stop interfering in neighboring countries, implement a policy of friendship with all countries, not participate in any military blocs, establish friendly and trade relations with all countries on the principle of equality, and accept foreign aid without any restrictive conditions. 3. Abolish martial law, abolish the current constitution, dissolve the Constitutional Assembly that serves as Thanom Kittikachorn's puppet, establish a Constitutional Assembly composed of representatives from all walks of life and all parties, abolish the "Anti-Communist Act" and other laws that infringe on the people's freedoms and rights, and unconditionally release all political prisoners. 4. Improve the people's livelihood, develop the national economy through self-reliance, distribute land to farmers, and solve the unemployment problem.

In the letter to compatriots, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand first listed the Thanom Kittikachorn group's pursuit of the aggressive and war policies of the United States since seizing power in October 1958, and its adoption of various reactionary measures to frantically suppress and plunder the people. It also pointed out that "all the facts clearly show that Thanom Kittikachorn and his regime are a group of traitorous and extremely corrupt dictators, a government that is unprecedentedly leading the country to destruction."

The letter to compatriots said that the Thanom Kittikachorn traitorous government has increasingly and heavily shackled Thailand with the chains of American imperialism. According to the war plans of American imperialism, the Thanom Kittikachorn regime has used most of the national fiscal budget for military purposes, building and renovating several airports and strategic highways, and preparing to establish missile and atomic weapons bases in Thailand. In order to create tension, it has also allowed the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to hold regular military exercises in Thailand and has adopted a hostile attitude towards its neighbors and socialist camp countries.

The letter to compatriots severely criticized the Thanom Kittikachorn government for shamefully acting as a tool for American imperialism to threaten and interfere in neighboring countries. For example, supporting and instigating reactionary groups in Cambodia to conspire to overthrow the Cambodian government that implements an independent, neutral, and peaceful policy; assisting British imperialism in suppressing the independence struggle of the Malayan people; interfering in Lao's internal affairs and aiding the Lao fascist reactionary groups in provoking civil war, especially after Captain Kong Le launched a coup and the Lao people rose up to overthrow the Lao fascist military regime, the Thanom Kittikachorn group intensified its interference in Laos. The letter to compatriots then exposed the various crimes of the Thanom Kittikachorn group's serious interference in Lao's internal affairs and emphasized that Thanom Kittikachorn's above-mentioned actions not only violated Lao's sovereignty but also exacerbated the tension in the Southeast Asian region. The letter to compatriots said that we firmly oppose this behavior and at the same time call on all compatriots to immediately rise up and wage a resolute struggle to oppose and stop Thanom Kittikachorn's above-mentioned actions.

The letter to compatriots also pointed out that the lives of people from all walks of life in Thailand are deteriorating under the heavy exploitation of the Thanom Kittikachorn government: "The already declining economic situation is now even more depressed. The Thanom Kittikachorn's policy of following American imperialism in expanding armaments and preparing for war has made it impossible for the vast majority of the national fiscal budget to be used to develop production or improve the people's living conditions. All funds are being spent on the military and police."

After strongly condemning the Thanom Kittikachorn government for implementing a dictatorial rule and traitorous policies and insisting on being an enemy of the people, the letter to compatriots called for the overthrow of the Thanom Kittikachorn regime.

    泰国共产党中央发表告全国同胞书
    号召人民团结起来成立广泛的爱国阵线
    驱逐美国侵略势力推翻乃沙立卖国政权
    新华社13日讯　曼谷消息：泰国共产党中央委员会最近发表告全国同胞书，号召泰国各阶层人民成立广泛的爱国阵线，团结起来，把美帝国主义侵略势力驱逐出去，推翻乃沙立卖国独裁政权，建立一个实行真正独立、中立、和平和民主政策的政府。
    告同胞书宣布，为了推翻乃沙立的卖国独裁统治，把美帝国主义侵略势力从泰国驱逐出去，泰国共产党欢迎同所有爱国、爱民主的人士、各阶层和各党派合作。
    告同胞书说：为了成立广泛的爱国阵线，泰国共产党提出四项政策主张，作为全国人民团结合作的基础。这些政策是：一、推翻乃沙立卖国独裁统治，驱逐美帝国主义侵略势力，成立实行真正独立、中立、和平和民主政策的政府。二、废除追随美帝国主义的政策，退出东南亚条约组织，废除各项束缚和破坏国家主权的条约，停止干涉邻国，实行同各国友好的政策，不参加任何军事集团，在平等的原则下同各国建立友好及贸易关系，接受不附任何约束性条件的外国援助。三、废除军事戒严令，废除现行宪法，解散作为乃沙立傀儡的制宪议会，成立由各阶层人民、各党派代表组成的制宪议会，废除“防共条例”和其他侵犯人民自由权利的法律，无条件释放所有政治犯。四、改善人民生活，自力更生地发展国家经济，分配土地给农民以及解决失业问题等。
    泰国共产党中央委员会在告同胞书中首先列举了乃沙立集团自1958年10月政执以来追随美国的侵略政策和战争政策、采取各种疯狂的镇压和掠夺人民的反动措施。并且指出，“种种事实清楚地表明，乃沙立及其政权是一群卖国和腐败透顶的独裁者，这是一个前所未有的把国家引向毁灭的政府”。
    告同胞书说，乃沙立卖国政府已使泰国日益沉重地套上美帝国主义的枷锁。乃沙立政权按照美帝国主义的战争计划，把国家财政预算的大部分用于军事方面，修建和整顿好几处飞机场和战略公路，准备在泰国建立导弹和原子武器基地。它为了制造紧张局势，还允许东南亚条约组织在泰国举行经常性的军事演习，对它的邻国及社会主义阵营国家采取敌对态度。
    告同胞书严厉地抨击了乃沙立政府可耻地充当美帝国主义威胁和干预邻国的工具。例如，扶植和唆使柬埔寨反动集团阴谋推翻执行独立、中立和和平政策的柬埔寨政府；协助英帝国主义镇压马来亚人民的独立斗争；干预老挝内政，援助老挝法西斯反动集团挑起内战，特别是在贡勒大尉发动政变，老挝人民起来推翻老挝的法西斯军人政权以后，乃沙立集团更加紧了对老挝的干涉。告同胞书接着揭露了乃沙立集团严重干涉老挝内政的各种罪行，并强调指出，乃沙立的上述行径不仅侵犯了老挝的主权，而且使东南亚地区的局势趋向紧张。告同胞书说，我们坚决地反对这种行径，同时呼吁全国同胞也立即起来，为反对并制止乃沙立的上述行径进行坚决的斗争。
    告同胞书还指出，泰国各阶层人民在乃沙立政府的重重盘剥下生活正日益恶化：“原来已经衰退的经济情况，现在更加萧条了。乃沙立实行的追随美帝国主义扩军备战的政策，使得绝大部分的国家财政预算无法用来发展生产或改善人民的生活状况，所有款项都被耗费在军事和警察方面。”
    告同胞书在强烈指责乃沙立政府实行独裁统治和卖国政策、坚持与人民为敌后，号召推翻乃沙立政权。
