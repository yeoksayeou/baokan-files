    On the Front Lines of Autumn Planting
    By our correspondent in Xinjiang

    Like every autumn, the magnificent main peak of the Tianshan Mountains remains covered in snow, sparkling and white. However, the winter wheat sowing work in the Xinghuo Commune of Shawan County at the foot of the mountains is very different from previous years. The Xinghuo Commune is known for having a lot of land and few laborers, with each laborer being responsible for an average of more than sixty mu of cultivated land. Under such conditions, is it possible to plant more and plant better? The commune members gave an affirmative answer. This answer is not just a promise, but action, selfless hard work.

    Expand Planting Again and Again

    The Xinghuo Commune plans to expand the winter wheat planting area by more than 11,000 mu this year, with each laborer planting an average of five more mu. Where will the land come from? In addition to rationally arranging crop rotations and planting all the fallow land, there is only reclamation.

    Among the six production brigades of the commune, the Wulawusu Brigade was a poor team before communization. In the past three years, due to the expansion of the planting area by more than 3,800 mu, more grain has been harvested, and this team has "turned over." This year, this brigade is expanding the planting of winter wheat by 2,200 mu. When the more than 5,000 mu of wheat stubble land was about to be plowed, a group of people set off for the reclamation front. The wasteland is next to Weihu Lake in the north. In summer, the snowmelt from the Tianshan Mountains seeps into the ground and overflows onto the surface, turning the soil into a swampy beach of thin mud, which single riders on horseback dare not cross. How can plows be used to plant crops?

    As early as spring, the members of the Xinghuo Commune dug drainage canals as deep as two or three meters here. In just one summer, the accumulated water on more than 5,000 mu of land was drained. This is a fertile land, black and shiny, with half a foot of humus. Because of the dense weeds, the plowing cattle cannot plow it. When the comrades from the Karamay Mining Bureau heard the news, they immediately allocated a Stalin 80 large tractor to support them. The members of the Wulawusu Brigade warmly received the tractor drivers, sending watermelons and cantaloupes three times a day, and clearing wasteland and repairing canals day and night in front of the tractor.

    When the cadres and members of this brigade saw us, they could not restrain their inner joy. They expressed one after another: the planting plan of 7,200 mu must be exceeded.

    Watering Late at Night

    The commune members who had fought for a day were already sound asleep. At this time, the reporter came to the south barrier of the first production team of the Wulawusu Brigade and saw the irrigator Ma Chengji building dams to water the land, preparing moist soil for winter wheat sowing. Facing the cold wind blowing from the snow-capped mountains, he stood in the icy water, opened the water inlet, and heard the canal water rushing into the branch canals and flowing into the fields. With the faint reflection of the water surface, he checked whether the water flow was even. This year, the winter wheat area has been expanded a lot. Every drop of water is like a drop of oil. Thinking of this, he swung the iron shovel even more diligently.

    Suddenly, a long call came from a distance: "Ma—Cheng—ji!" This was the voice of another irrigator, Ma Cai. "I—am—here!" In this quiet night, he was not the only one working hard. In the fields of the entire Wulawusu Brigade and the entire Xinghuo Commune, there were dozens of irrigators like him, fighting sleeplessly at their posts, increasing the area of ​​watering per day and night from more than 600 mu to more than 1,300 mu.

    Branch Secretary in the Field

    The day after the county held a telephone conference, Ma Guifang (a Hui nationality), the branch secretary of the third team of the Lugong Brigade, came to the sowing operation site in the field with her luggage. She threw her bedding under a big tree and hurried to the field. When the commune members saw that the branch secretary had also moved here, their enthusiasm for production increased even more.

    Ma Guifang, in her thirties, is already the mother of four children. She takes the lead in labor throughout the year, was once elected as a women's representative, and became the branch secretary in May this year. Ma Guifang does everything. Wherever she is needed, she goes; she grasps both production and life, and also specifically solves the ideological problems of the commune members. Harrowing is the weak link in the production team's rush to plant winter wheat, so she went to harrow the land with them. This is a large strip field of more than 100 mu, and seven double-wheeled double-share plows and three single-share plows can plow a 5-meter-wide strip of land in one pass. With such a wide distance, two iron harrows need to go back and forth twice to complete the harrowing. Harrowing is far behind the plowing work. "Why can't harrowing keep up?" After Ma Guifang understood the situation, she found that iron harrows and plowing horses were still available, but there were few people and they could not be matched. Can the efficiency of harrowing be improved without increasing manpower? She couldn't find the answer in her heart for a while.

    During the break, she held a meeting with several harrowers. Finally, she came up with a solution: line up five horses in a row, connect five harrows together, and one person can lead the horses, and one pass can harrow a 5-meter-wide wheat field. At first, the five horses were of different speeds and bumped their legs against each other. Ma Guifang carefully observed and found that the horse leaders did not have experience in driving horses, so she transferred Ma Jincai, an old hand who had been driving carts for many years, to lead the horses for harrowing. This time it was completely different, advancing, turning, acting freely, keeping up with the progress of plowing every time, and also saving four laborers. Five days later, the plowing, harrowing, sowing and other processes of this sowing operation team were all brought into line, and the work efficiency was more than doubled.

    After Receiving Emergency Instructions

    The commune members at the field production site of the third team of the Sigong Brigade had just finished dinner when the Party branch secretary came to hold a meeting of the sowing professional team and conveyed the emergency instructions from the higher-level Party committee: there are only ten days left in the sowing period, but the daily sowing progress is only between 400 and 500 mu. We must seize the opportunity to increase the daily sowing progress of the brigade's eight sowing machines to 625 mu to ensure that the 11,000 mu of winter wheat is sown in a timely manner.

    Hearing these instructions, people's fatigue from the day suddenly disappeared. They spoke one after another, checking loopholes and coming up with ideas to discuss ways to speed up the sowing progress. The sowing machine operators decided to change people and horses but not machines, working around the clock in three shifts, sowing non-stop.

    A new battle began. The moon quietly rose from the east, and the first shift of twelve plowmen and four harrowers got up in the dark, hitched up their plows and went into the fields to work. Five horses pulled a ten-row sowing machine lightly and quickly, sowing more than five mu of land in one round. One side was plowing fast, and the other side was sowing a lot, but the old uncle Chen Jingli, who was pulling and transporting wheat seeds, was busy. He drove four horse-drawn carts, traveling back and forth on the road of more than ten miles between the wheat field and the winter wheat field, loading and transporting seeds.

    At night, dark clouds surged in the north, with lightning and thunder. Communist Youth League members Xiao Shengyuan, Zheng Shengyuan and another girl named Li Yinzhen pulled five horses to take over the sowing shift. Although it was so dark that they couldn't see their fingers, the sowing machine was still working non-stop. Twenty-four hours passed, and three shifts of people used one sowing machine to sow 165 mu, which was almost three times faster than the average daily progress.

    在秋播第一线
    本报驻新疆记者
    瑰丽的天山主峰和往年秋天一样，依然积雪皑皑，晶莹洁白。可是山脚下的沙湾县星火公社的冬麦播种工作却和往年大不相同。星火公社是以地多劳动力少出名的，平均每个劳动力担负的耕地面积有六十多亩。在这样的条件下，还能不能够再多种一些？种好一些？公社的社员们作了肯定的回答。这回答不光是诺言，而是行动，是忘我的辛勤劳动。
    扩种再扩种
    星火公社今年冬麦播种面积要扩大一万一千多亩，平均每个劳动力要多种五亩。土地从哪里来？除了合理安排茬口、轮歇地全部种上，就只有开荒。
    公社六个大队中，乌拉乌苏大队在公社化前本是个穷队，近三年来由于播种面积扩大了三千八百多亩，多打了粮食，这个队才算“翻过身”来。今年，这个大队扩种二千二百亩冬麦。当五千多亩麦茬地快要犁完的时候，一班人马就开往垦荒战线了。荒地在北面苇湖旁边。夏日，天山融雪雪水渗入地层，又溢出地表，土壤变成稀泥的沼泽滩，单人轻骑不敢过往，怎么能套犁种庄稼呢？
    远在春天，星火公社社员在这里挖了深达两、三米的排水干渠，只一个夏天，五千多亩地的积水便排除了。这是一块肥沃的土地，乌油油、亮晶晶，腐植质有半尺厚。因为杂草丛生，耕牛犁不动。克拉玛依矿务局的同志们听到这个消息，马上拨给一台斯大林八十号大型拖拉机前往支援，乌拉乌苏大队的社员热情地接待了拖拉机手，一天三番五次地送西瓜、哈密瓜，没明没黑地在拖拉机前面打荒开路，修渠引水。
  这个大队的干部和社员看见我们，抑制不住内心的高兴。他们纷纷表示：七千二百亩的种麦计划要突破。
    深夜浇水
    奋战了一天的社员已经沉沉入睡。这时记者来到乌拉乌苏大队第一生产小队的南障，看到浇水员马成绩正在打坝浇水，为冬麦播种准备湿润的土地。迎着雪山上吹来的寒风，他站在冰冷的水中，铲开水口，只听得渠水哗哗地涌进毛渠，流进一块块畦田里去。借着水面微弱的反光，他察看流水是否浇得均匀。今年冬麦面积扩大很多，一滴水，就是一滴油，想到这里，他手里的铁锨舞得更勤了。
    忽然，远远的地方传来了一声长长的呼唤：“马——成——绩！”这是另一个浇水员马才的声音。“我——在——这——里！”，在这静静的深夜里，不只是他一个人在辛勤劳动。整个乌拉乌苏大队，整个星火公社的田野上，有几十名和他一样的浇水队员，彻夜不眠地战斗在自己的岗位上，把一昼夜浇水的面积由六百多亩提高到一千三百多亩。
    支部书记在田间
    县里开过电话会议的第二天，陆宫大队三小队支部书记马桂芳（回族）背着行李来到了田间的播种作业点，她把铺盖扔在一棵大树下，便匆匆地向地里走去。社员看见支部书记也搬来了，生产热情更加高涨起来。
    马桂芳，三十来岁，已经是四个孩子的妈妈了。她一年四季带头劳动，曾经被选为妇女代表，今年5月担任支部书记。马桂芳什么活都干。哪里需要，她就到哪里；既抓生产，又抓生活，还具体地解决社员思想上的问题。耙地是这个生产队抢种冬麦的薄弱环节，她就跟着去耙地。这是一块一百多亩的大条田，七架双轮双铧犁和三架单铧犁一趟能犁五米宽的土地。这样宽的距离，两张铁耙需要往返两趟才能耙完。耙地远远跟不上翻耕工作了。“耙地为什么赶不上去？”马桂芳经过了解，铁耙和耕马都还有，就是人手少，套不过来。能不能不增加人手而提高耙地工效呢？她心里一时还找不出答案。
    休息的时候，她和几个耙地手开了个会。终于想出办法：把五匹马排成横排，五张耙横连一起，一人牵马，一次过去，就可以耙完五米宽的麦地。开始，五匹马快慢不一，相互碰腿。马桂芳仔细观察，发现牵马人没有赶马经验，于是把赶车多年的老把式马金才调来牵马耙地。这回完全不同了，前进、转弯，行动自如，趟趟赶上了犁地的进度，还节约四个劳动力。五天以后，这个播种作业组的犁地、耙地、播种等工序全都纳入正轨，工效分别提高了一倍多。
    接到紧急指示后
    肆宫大队三小队田间生产点的社员们刚吃过晚饭，党支部书记赶来召开播种专业组会议，传达了上级党委的紧急指示：播种期只有十多天了，播种日进度却只在四百到五百亩之间，必须抓紧时机，把全大队八架播种机日播进度提高到六百二十五亩，才能保证适时播完一万一千亩冬麦。
    听到这个指示，人们一天的疲劳顿时消失，你一言，我一语，查漏洞，出点子，讨论加快播种进度的办法。播种机手决定换人换马不换机器，日夜三班，不停地播种。
    一场新的战斗开始了。月亮悄悄从东方升了上来，第一班十二个扶犁手和四个耙磨地的社员摸黑起床，套犁进地干起来了。五匹马拉着一架十行播种机轻快如飞，来回一趟就播下了五亩多地。一边是犁的快，一边是播的多，只是忙坏了拉运麦种的老大伯陈景礼。他赶着四套马车，来往在麦场和冬麦地之间十多里地的路上，装运种籽。
    晚上，北方黑云涌起，电闪雷鸣。共青团员萧生元、郑生员和另外一个名叫李印珍的姑娘拉来五匹马，接班播种。虽然伸手不见五指，播种机还是工作不停。二十四小时过去了，三班人马用一架播种机播了一百六十五亩，比平均日进度快了近三倍。
