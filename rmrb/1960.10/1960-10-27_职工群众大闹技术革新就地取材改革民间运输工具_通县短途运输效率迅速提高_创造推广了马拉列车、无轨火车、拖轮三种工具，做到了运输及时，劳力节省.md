    Staff and Masses Engage in Technical Innovation, Using Local Materials to Reform Civilian Transportation Tools
    Tong County's Short-Distance Transportation Efficiency Rapidly Increases
    Creating and Promoting Three Types of Tools: Horse-Drawn Trains, Trackless Trains, and Tugboats, Achieving Timely Transportation and Labor Savings
    (Our Dispatch) Tong County, Beijing, transportation department employees have created and promoted three types of short-distance transportation tools: horse-drawn trains, trackless trains, and tugboats, increasing transportation efficiency by about 70%, fundamentally solving the problem of this year's transportation tasks doubling compared to last year, while facing a shortage of labor and transportation tools.
    Currently, the production materials needed by various people's communes in Tong County, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and new agricultural tools, as well as the main agricultural and sideline products produced, can be delivered and transported out in a timely manner. The raw materials needed for iron smelting in the county, such as ore and coke, are now transported as soon as they arrive, without delaying production. Due to the improvement in transportation efficiency, recently, the county-level specialized transportation departments have also extracted one hundred horse-drawn carts to go to the people's communes to support the "Three Autumns" work.
    Tong County is located in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, and the main transportation tool is horse-drawn carts. This summer, in order to more effectively support agricultural production, the transportation department of the county transferred most of the professional horse-drawn carts under the Transportation Management Station to the production teams of various people's communes, to undertake field transportation tasks. During this period, with the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the county's social transportation tasks surged by about one time. Therefore, many materials were frequently backlogged at loading and unloading points, unable to be transported in time. Based on this situation, the Tong County Party Committee decided to widely mobilize the masses, adopt simple and crude methods, rely on their own efforts to manufacture and reform short-distance transportation tools, and do everything possible to tap the potential of existing equipment to meet the needs of production development.
    Under the unified leadership of the County Party Committee, a vigorous mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution in short-distance transportation was launched in various transportation departments. The cart workers, regardless of their low cultural level and poor technical knowledge, all contributed ideas and suggestions. Without lathes, they used knives, pliers, axes, and saws; without factory buildings, they built kilns in open spaces; without steel plates, they used bamboo boards instead; without electric welders, they borrowed them from nearby factories during nighttime breaks. They experienced many twists and turns, overcame technical, material, and equipment barriers, and finally manufactured nearly three hundred (vessels) short-distance transportation tools with low cost, material saving, high efficiency, and easy operation within seven months. With these new tools participating in transportation, a situation of both water and land transportation developed throughout the county, and transportation efficiency rapidly improved. The daily transportation volume has increased from more than 3,500 tons before the technical revolution to more than 5,700 tons now.
    There are three types of short-distance transportation tools created and promoted in Tong County. The first type is the new type of horse-drawn trailer. This trailer has four wheels and an automatic braking device. The tires are one-half narrower than the wheels of the old horse-drawn carts. When driving, due to the narrow wheels, the friction on the ground is small, making it easier to pull. The four cart bows on the vehicle are made of eleven layers of thick bamboo boards instead of steel plates. Its firmness has been tested by pressure and fully meets the use requirements. Each trailer weighs only half a ton, two-thirds lighter than the old horse-drawn carts. With this new type of trailer, four horses can pull eight sections, with a cargo weight of eight tons and a vehicle body weight of four tons, totaling twelve tons, with each horse carrying an average of three tons. After testing with a dynamometer, a strong horse or mule can carry 2.5 to 3 tons on a flat road. Therefore, it does not exceed the prescribed load. In the past, when transporting goods with old horse-drawn carts, because it only had two wheels, the front part needed to be carried on the horse's back. One horse pulling a trailer loaded with one ton of goods also had a total load of 2.5 tons for pulling and carrying. Therefore, now the same horse can pull twice as much cargo.
    The second type is the trackless train. It is modified from an old boiler locomotive and is shaped like a steam locomotive, suitable for driving on highways. It uses coal to burn water into steam for power, which can greatly save gasoline or diesel compared to internal combustion engines. This train can tow seven rubber-tired trailers, each trailer carrying three tons of cargo, at a speed of about ten kilometers per hour, which is equivalent to the transportation capacity of twenty ordinary horse-drawn carts. When it is busy with farming, it can be fitted with a belt and still be used to power irrigation of farmland.
    The third type is tugboats and barges. The shape of the tugboat is sharp at the head and square at the tail. The engine inside the boat is modified from an old automobile engine, and the fuel is coal. It can carry about one hundred tons of cargo and travel on the river at a speed of eight kilometers per hour.
    The Transportation Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Transportation Command attach great importance to the county's experience in vigorously reforming short-distance transportation tools. Recently, they held an on-site meeting in Tong County, calling on the staff of the transportation departments of various districts (counties) in the city to learn from the county's spirit of self-reliance in manufacturing and reforming short-distance transportation tools, and continue to launch a high tide of technical revolution in short-distance transportation.

    职工群众大闹技术革新就地取材改革民间运输工具
    通县短途运输效率迅速提高
    创造推广了马拉列车、无轨火车、拖轮三种工具，做到了运输及时，劳力节省
    本报讯　北京市通县运输部门职工创造和推广了马拉列车、无轨火车、拖轮三种短途运输工具，使运输效率提高70％左右，基本上解决了今年运输任务比去年增加一倍、劳力和运输工具不足的问题。
    现在，通县各人民公社所需的化肥、农药和新式农具等生产资料，以及生产出来的主要农副产品，都能及时送到和运出。本县炼铁所需的矿石、焦炭等原料，已经做到随到随运，不误生产。由于运输效率的提高，最近县级各专业运输部门又抽出一百辆马车，奔赴各人民公社支援“三秋”工作。
    通县位在北京的东郊，主要的运输工具是马车。今年夏天，这个县的运输部门为了更有效地支援农业生产，把交通运输管理站所属的大部分专业马车，下放到各人民公社生产队，担负田间运输任务。在此期间，随着工农业生产的继续跃进，这个县的社会运输任务又激增一倍左右。因此，经常发生许多物资积压在装卸地点，不能及时运送的情况。中共通县县委根据这个情况，决定广泛发动群众，采取因陋就简，自力更生的办法，自己动手制造和改革短途运输工具，千方百计地挖掘现有设备的潜力，来满足生产发展的需要。
    在县委统一领导下，各个运输部门蓬勃地展开了一个大搞短途运输技术革新和技术革命运动。马车工人们不顾文化水平低、技术知识差等困难，人人献计献策，没有车床，就用刀钳斧锯；没有厂房，就在空地上搭起烘炉；没有钢板，就用竹板代替；没有电焊机，就乘附近工厂夜间休息时去借用。他们经历了许多次波折，攻克了技术、材料和设备关，在七个月内，终于制造出近三百辆（艘）花钱少、用料省、效率高、操作容易的短途运输工具。随着这些新工具参加运输，全县出现了水陆运输并举，运输效率迅速提高的局面，日运量已从技术革命前的三千五百多吨增加到现在的五千七百多吨。
    通县创造和推广的短途运输工具有三种。第一种是新型的马拉拖车。这种拖车有四个车轮，有自动刹车装置。轮胎比旧马车的车轮窄二分之一。行驶时，由于车轮窄，在地面的摩擦力小，容易拉动。车辆上的四个车弓，是用十一层厚的竹板代替钢板绑扎成的。它的牢固程度，经过压力试验，完全符合使用。每节拖车只有半吨重，比旧马车轻三分之二。采用这种新型拖车，四匹马可以拉八节，其中货物重八吨，车身重四吨，共达十二吨，每匹马平均负重三吨。经过用拉力表测验结果，一匹强壮的马或骡，在平坦的道路上，都能负重二吨半到三吨。因此，没有超过规定负重。过去，用旧马车运货，因为它只有两个车轮，前面部分需要驼在马背上，一匹马拖拉装载一吨货物的拖车，拉力和驼力的总负重也是两吨半。所以，现在同样的一匹马就能多拉一倍的货物。
    第二种是无轨火车。它是用旧的锅驼机改装的，形状和蒸汽火车头差不多，适合在公路上行驶。它是用煤把水烧成蒸汽后作动力的，比内燃机发动，能大大节省汽油或柴油。这种火车，能拖挂七个胶轮拖车，每个拖车载重三吨货，时速十公里左右，等于二十辆普通马车的运输能力。当农忙时，它装上一条皮带，仍能作动力灌溉农田。
    第三种是拖轮和拖船。拖轮的形状是头部尖尾部方。船内的发动机是用汽车的旧机器改装的，燃料用煤。它能载一百吨左右的货物，以每小时八公里的航速行驶在河面上。
    中共北京市委交通工作部和市运输指挥部，十分重视这个县大力改革短途运输工具的经验，最近在通县召开了现场会议，号召全市各区（县）运输部门的职工学习这个县自己动手制造和改革短途运输工具的精神，继续掀起一个大搞短途运输技术革命的高潮。（附图片）
