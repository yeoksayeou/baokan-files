Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch (TASS, New York, 11th dispatch): The following is the full text of Khrushchev's speech on the procedure for discussing the disarmament issue at the UN General Assembly plenary meeting on October 11, 1960:

    Mr. President! Distinguished Delegates!

    We are deciding on issues that need to be discussed at the UN General Assembly plenary meeting. The disarmament issue - this is the issue of issues. This is how the Soviet people and the people of the socialist camp view it. This is also how the people of all countries who sincerely desire to ensure lasting peace in the world view it.

    Therefore, we believe that the disarmament issue must be discussed at the UN General Assembly plenary meeting so that this issue, which troubles the people of all countries, can occupy a major position in the work of this session of the UN General Assembly.

    The UN General Assembly is the highest body of the United Nations, established not only to handle some disputes that often arise between countries, but primarily to solve the important issue of ensuring peace.

    Under the present conditions, the disarmament issue is the most fundamental issue, and whether lasting peace can be ensured depends on its resolution. No issue, no matter how important, can be compared to this issue, because whether a new world war breaks out depends on this issue. Eliminating war is only possible under the condition that countries reach an agreement on disarmament, and that disarmament is carried out under extremely strict international supervision, so that no country can secretly rearm and threaten other countries again.

    The Soviet delegation has submitted this issue as a top priority and urgent issue for discussion at the UN General Assembly plenary meeting. Today, we call on all delegates to understand the full seriousness and urgency of this issue.

    Mr. Lodge said that because the UN General Assembly's agenda has seventy-nine issues, the disarmament issue cannot be given due attention. Of course, if one treats the disarmament issue with such an attitude, if one treats the work of the United Nations with such an attitude and understands the main mission of the United Nations in this way, then frankly speaking, this means dooming the United Nations to bankruptcy. In this case, this organization cannot shoulder the main task entrusted to it.

    The primary responsibility of the United Nations is to ensure peace. In the cause of ensuring peace, the main issue among the main issues is to reach an agreement on disarmament and the destruction of armaments under strict international supervision.

    Delegates, we should all understand this well, because it concerns the fate of peace and the fate of the people of all countries.

    The path recommended by the General Committee has been explored for many years. How many years have various committees discussed the disarmament issue, but have these committees done much in practically resolving this issue? Not much, very little, one could say nothing at all. Therefore, the Soviet government hopes that all countries will finally realize their responsibility, realize the full importance of the disarmament issue, and discuss it in the General Assembly plenary meeting.

    If the disarmament issue continues to be delayed, just as the issue has been delayed to date, then there is a danger of events developing in the same direction as in the era of the League of Nations before the Second World War. Indian Prime Minister Nehru spoke very convincingly about this point in his speech at this session. That is, there is this danger: the United Nations will follow the old ox cart road of the League of Nations on the disarmament issue.

    Therefore, we must make special efforts to pull the wheels out of the deep ruts and put them on a road that can guarantee a disarmament agreement.

    I would like to tell the delegates that a very complex situation has now formed. Now, secondary and trivial issues are being discussed. Not a day goes by without more and more weapons being accumulated, and not a day goes by without new provocations, which do not promote the resolution of the disarmament issue, but hinder it, deepen the tension, intensify the Cold War, and expand the arms race.

    It is difficult to convince those who desire peace, that is, those who desire to solve all issues that guarantee peace, that the United Nations has no time to discuss the extremely important issue of complete and thorough disarmament. Everyone remembers how much time was spent discussing whether it was worth keeping the Chiang Kai-shek puppet in the United Nations, although everyone with a sound mind understands that the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China should have been restored long ago, because the government of the People's Republic of China represents all the Chinese people. This issue has been discussed for many years in a row, and this issue has taken up a lot of time in each session of the General Assembly. The primary responsibility for the fact that China's legitimate rights in the United Nations have not yet been restored lies with the United States and its allies in the military bloc.

    The representatives of Western countries do not have time to discuss the disarmament issue, but they do not spare time to maintain international tension and prevent the normalization of relations between countries. Through their activities, they have created a situation that makes it impossible to reach a disarmament agreement in the future. The US government is still pursuing Dulles' "brink of war" policy. Everyone knows that it is easy to fall off any edge, and then a world war may break out, bringing endless disasters to mankind.

    Please look at other similar "issues," which the United Nations has also discussed for many years, but have yielded nothing except stench and poisoning of the international atmosphere. I am referring here to the so-called Hungarian issue, the Tibetan issue, and other similar issues that the skillful provocateurs of the United States are looking for everywhere. They are doing everything they can to focus the attention of the United Nations on these issues, diverting the United Nations' attention from issues that are truly important and urgent for the international community. But everyone understands that such issues cannot lead to the easing of international tensions; on the contrary, they contain the seeds of disputes and hostility and artificially create international tensions. Some groups are trying to continue the "Cold War" in this way.

    The time has come for everyone to understand the seriousness of the current situation.

    The fact that most of the heads of state and heads of government attending the UN General Assembly have returned to their countries, and others are preparing to leave, shows that they apparently distrust this session of the UN General Assembly and do not have hope that such an urgent issue as complete and thorough disarmament can be effectively discussed.

    However, this situation can be changed, because current means of transportation provide the possibility of flying away quickly and returning quickly. I believe that if the disarmament issue is seriously raised in the UN General Assembly plenary meeting and given special urgent significance, then the heads of government and state who have already left may return to the General Assembly. Even the heads of state and government who did not participate in this session at the beginning may come.

    This issue can also be resolved in another way. I have already talked about this with British Prime Minister Macmillan, with other national leaders, and at a press conference with the UN Correspondents Association. Perhaps it would be appropriate to discuss the issue of complete and thorough disarmament at an emergency session of the General Assembly.

    Now, the United States is in a situation where the US government seems unwilling to undertake any new important obligations due to preparations for the presidential election. And without the constructive participation of the United States, a disarmament agreement cannot be reached at the UN General Assembly.

    An emergency session of the General Assembly may be convened in March or April next year, and it is recommended that the heads of state or heads of government of various countries serve as the heads of delegations attending this meeting.

    Efforts must be made to reach a disarmament agreement at the emergency session of the General Assembly, so that each country can make a significant contribution to the common cause of reaching a disarmament agreement and ensuring world peace.

    I think that all those who are committed to peace and friendship among the people of all countries will welcome this decision on convening an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly.

    I would also like to repeat that it is best to hold this meeting in Europe, for example, in Geneva, because most of the countries that have joined the United Nations are geographically close to Europe. This meeting could be held in Moscow or Leningrad. If so, we will do everything we can to create the necessary conditions for the normal work of the UN General Assembly meeting and for all the delegates attending this meeting.

    In short, the Soviet delegation insists that the issue of complete and thorough disarmament must be discussed at the UN General Assembly plenary meeting with the participation of heads of government. If, for this or that reason, it is not possible to fully discuss the disarmament issue at this meeting and reach an agreement at least on the main principles, then the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to submit one issue—the issue of complete and thorough disarmament—for discussion at the meeting.

    I call on you, delegates, to realize the full responsibility of the United Nations in resolving such an important issue as disarmament. The people of the world expect the United Nations to finally pave the way to solving such an urgent and important task as complete and thorough disarmament.

    Rebuttal Speech on the Disarmament Issue

    Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch (TASS, New York, 11th dispatch): Khrushchev exercised his right of reply at the UN General Assembly meeting on October 11 and made a speech on the disarmament issue. The full text is as follows: Mr. President! Distinguished Delegates!

    I have listened carefully to the speeches here. The representatives of Western countries are mainly opposed to our proposal to discuss the disarmament issue at the General Assembly plenary meeting. These people are very experienced in debate. They say that the Soviet Union raised the disarmament issue for discussion at the UN General Assembly plenary meeting for propaganda purposes. However, they themselves are such propagandists, and as the saying goes, propaganda of their own views is their forte. (Laughter in the hall)

    Now, someone is "stuffing" a question to the delegates in order to cause controversy. This question is: which UN body is better to discuss the disarmament issue: the General Assembly plenary meeting or the First Committee? This is a useless debate! For us, there is no dispute on this issue; we hope to discuss this issue wherever a solution to this urgent issue can be found as soon as possible, and the solution is truly beneficial to the people of all countries.

    In this way, you may ask me: why do we have to insist on discussing this issue at the General Assembly plenary meeting and not agree to go to the committee? The reason is very simple. We have also discussed it in the committee. We already know, please forgive my rude metaphor, this is like a stable, we know its smell, and we will not get any results in the committee.

    You know, we were once in a five-nation committee with the participation of Britain, the United States, Canada, France, and the Soviet Union. We held meetings in this committee for many years, and even agreed at the beginning that the debate in this committee would not be published in the press and would not be allowed to be brought out of this committee. We considered and sincerely believed that the people participating in the work of this committee, the representatives of the above-mentioned countries, would really pay attention not to cause acrimony in the discussion of the disarmament issue, but to create better conditions for the rapid achievement of an agreement.

    But what was the result?

    The United States had the best representative in the Five-Nation Committee - Mr. Stassen. However, he finally left the committee, or more precisely, was "fired," because he disagreed with the practice of imposing on him the views of the former US Secretary of State, the late Dulles.

    We see that the only serious thing this committee did was drink tea and coffee. (Laughter in the hall) Meetings, meetings, one person speaks, another listens, and the third asks to move the meeting to the next day. And so on, without end. Meetings were held there for several years, I don't know exactly, but we didn't stick to it. There is such a perhaps not very polite saying - let us ignore this organization and withdraw from it, because this is not an organization to solve the disarmament issue, but a guise to deceive public opinion, deceive the people, the working class, the working peasants, the intellectuals, and deceive all those who truly hope for disarmament. And we don't want to participate in this deception. (Applause)

    I see Jules Moch sitting here, he is a socialist, and he spent a lot of effort on the Ten-Nation Committee, what was the result? Nothing at all. (Cheering, applause in the hall)

    After my meeting with French President de Gaulle, we expressed a common understanding on certain issues. In order to reach a disarmament agreement, it is necessary to start with the destruction of nuclear weapons delivery vehicles to implement this agreement. I still support this view of French President de Gaulle.

    Mr. Jules Moch then reiterated Mr. de Gaulle's words at a press conference or somewhere else, I don't remember the exact location, he knows better. We are very happy because France announced this to everyone through its president and then through its representative on the Disarmament Committee. This means that we once thought that a partner participating in the Atlantic military bloc showed mutual understanding. But our hopes were dashed. When Jules Moch came to the committee, he said something completely different. This is another Jules Moch, not the one who speaks in public, but another one, this Jules Moch has been sitting in the committee for many years and is trying to undermine disarmament negotiations.

    Gentlemen! We still have some endurance, there is still a final hope that the General Assembly can help reach a disarmament agreement at its plenary meeting, so as to finally save mankind from the scourge of war. Gentlemen, I repeat, if war breaks out, it will spread around the world. Many people can't imagine what the future war will be like. I specifically envision such a war. The Soviet Union is not afraid of war! If someone imposes war on us, we will fight for our country. No matter how much sacrifice we pay, we will win! (Applause)

    But we must not forget that the losses in this war will be inestimable, and many of us sitting here will be responsible for this. Indeed, what can be obtained from some of those present. History will not forgive them for this! I want to emphasize: We believe that the disarmament issue must be discussed at the United Nations General Assembly, at its plenary meeting.

    Mr. Green, the representative of Canada, and the representative of the United States, whose name is difficult to pronounce, therefore I don't want to say it, so as not to break my tongue. (Active in the hall) I don't think anyone will guess wrong who I'm talking about. So they want to say that Khrushchev also intends to leave. Yes, I intend to return to Moscow on Thursday, October 13. But if you really hope for disarmament, then I will not only postpone my return to Moscow, but also stay here until a disarmament agreement is reached. (Applause)

    The situation in our country is very good. I, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, have been away from the country for a month, and things are going very well in the country, so I can stay here as long as it takes to reach a disarmament agreement. In our country, things are getting better year by year and day by day. (Applause)

    We believe that the struggle for disarmament is not propaganda. And you raised the issues of Hungary and Tibet, as Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki questioned, to sow the seeds of peace and mutual understanding? No, you brought up these issues to cause disputes between countries. Please raise them, we are not afraid of such issues. We are not bulls that can be teased with a red cloth, whoever teases it will pounce on them. We are Communists, our minds are sound; we have been tested by struggle. We fought the White bandits for four years, we defeated and crushed the enemies of the working class, and you want to scare us with debates! But, gentlemen, you know, in this regard, if I may say so, your waists are too thin. (Cheering, applause)

    Why do you want to raise the Tibetan issue? But, I repeat, please raise them if this is needed by you. When I toured New York, I saw Americans chewing gum with their mouths moving non-stop - this is their habit. And now you want to stuff a piece of cotton in the mouths of the delegates to the General Assembly instead of chewing gum, so that they can sit there and chew cotton. (Laughter in the hall) Whoever is interested, please come, whoever is willing, please try, and we will not do this.

    Gentlemen! We must wake up those who are drowsy here; we must wake up those present - the people sent them to the General Assembly to attend meetings so that they can discuss the disarmament issue, but God knows they are wandering around New York, and the people are paying them.

    Gentlemen, I say, the time will come when you understand the necessity of disarmament. The people will reject those who create obstacles on the road to peace and mutual understanding and do not create conditions for a disarmament agreement.

    We, the people of the socialist world, will not be frightened by you! Our economy is prosperous, our technology is constantly developing, and our people are united. You want to impose an arms race on us, we don't want to, but we are not afraid. We will defeat you! We are producing rockets in batches. Not long ago, I saw in a factory where rockets are produced like automatic machines making sausages, rockets are sent out one after another from our factory's production line.

    Some people want to test how we stand on the earth, and after you have tested us, you will be crushed by us. I am referring to the imperialists of the United States, France, Britain, Germany, and Japan who waged war on us in the early years of the October Revolution. We crushed their armies and swept them away from our sacred land like sweeping garbage. If the imperialists now carry out this aggression again, then we will once again crush the aggressors, and crush them even more severely.

    Some gentlemen are now beginning to prattle that Khrushchev is threatening others. No, Khrushchev is not threatening people, but realistically predicting the future to you. If you do not understand the real situation and do not create conditions to reach an agreement on the disarmament issue, things will be more complicated, because if there is no disarmament, it means there will be an arms race, and all arms races will ultimately lead to war. If war breaks out, then many of those present here will be gone.

    Sober up, if you have difficulty suppressing drowsiness, then pinch the sore spot. Many people here are used to flattering words, I am unwilling to indulge these people, unwilling to cater to these people when the world is on the brink of disaster. If someone is unhappy with what I said, that is, I have achieved my goal - that is what I hope for!

    What can be added?

    The people of Asia and Africa who were liberated from imperialist oppression not long ago have not yet fully realized their strength and are still following their executioners of yesterday - the colonialists. But today it is like this, and tomorrow it will not be like this. At that time, it will not be like this, the people will raise their heads and straighten their chests and become the true masters of the situation. Gentlemen, please note, this will be the case in the near future.

    It is up to you to vote in favor of discussing this issue in the First Committee. We have no objection to the First Committee, no objection at all, I don't even know where is better and where is worse: is it better in the First Committee, or is it better in the General Assembly. We are just saying that the First Committee has been tried. There were no results there. Therefore, in order to seek happiness for the people once again, we hope to submit this issue for discussion at the General Assembly plenary meeting. If you drive us into this committee again, we have the right to participate in the work of this committee or not. If we see that this committee has been turned into a guise to deceive the people, only talking about disarmament, and actually doing nothing as in the past, we will withdraw from this committee. We do not do guises, we do not deceive the working people of the world. (Applause)

    The representatives of Canada, the United States, and Britain have spoken here, and they have portrayed themselves as upright people. These are colonialists, they are rich, and the colonies are poor, because the colonialists plundered these colonies. They portray themselves here as "good-hearted Bodhisattvas." However, upright people see through the true colors of these people.

    Yes, we withdrew from the Five-Nation Committee. Why did we withdraw? Because you, gentlemen, turned this committee into a stable. You made it stink there, so that a sincere person had no way to breathe, so we withdrew. Fresh air attracts us, attracts us honest people, the loyal sons of the working people. We withdrew and will no longer go there.

    Gentlemen, if the disarmament issue will be discussed in the First Committee, then we will participate in the initial stage, we will see how the discussion is going there.

    Perhaps, it is necessary to pass a resolution to expand the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee. By the way, we once proposed that this committee be composed of representatives from fifteen countries. We agreed to participate in this committee, provided that there should be representatives of neutral countries participating there, as we suggested.

    If the General Assembly passes a resolution requiring all countries in the world to undertake the obligation to achieve disarmament and destroy weapons under international supervision, this committee will be able to work smoothly.

    What kind of international supervision is needed? I repeat, if the decision on complete and thorough disarmament and destruction of weapons is passed, we will agree to any supervision. Even if you pick out some fanatics who hate communism and socialism, we also trust them and let them formulate a supervision plan. The more in-depth and extensive the international supervision of disarmament is, the more it can guarantee the hope of the people of all countries, so that no country can secretly manufacture weapons and cannot threaten any neighbors with new wars.

    We are not afraid of supervision, but it is supervision of disarmament, it is supervision after the decision on disarmament is passed. Therefore, disarmament must be carried out under supervision.

    What proposal did Mr. Macmillan make on this podium? He also said this to me when he was talking to me: Mr. Khrushchev, you are too anxious, such a thing cannot be resolved quickly. He said, it must be like this: let us gather together and establish a political committee; let us establish a scientific committee. This scientific committee will decide how to kill fleas best, whether to tear off its legs or pinch off its head? (The whole place is active). This is of course a "scientific problem," gentlemen, but it is only suitable for those who do not want to disarm. Therefore, I said to Mr. Macmillan: You want to drag us into a maze that has neither light nor air, but only bats that are afraid of light. You want us to go there to participate in the scientific research on how to achieve disarmament. And this is said to take five to ten years.

    Gentlemen, if we wait for five or ten years, then we can be sure that we cannot reach a disarmament agreement. If now there are actually only three countries with atomic weapons, and the fourth country has begun to conduct atomic tests, then I believe that in five to ten years there will be dozens of such countries. Then it will be more difficult to reach an agreement.

    Now rockets and missiles can reach any point on the earth, and we can send our spacecraft to any corner. And what about five to ten years later? Gentlemen, you should think about this realistically. Therefore, if you truly hope for peace, not everyone here hopes for peace, but perhaps most people hope for peace, then I want to say to this majority: send out your call for disarmament, mankind will thank you. If you follow the imperialist monopoly capitalists (their representatives have spoken here) and follow the North Atlantic military bloc, people will curse you, because they entrusted the most sacred thing - peace - to you, but you have failed the hopes of the people, have not reached a disarmament agreement, and have led mankind to war.

    Gentlemen, it is one or the other. Please decide!

    I thank you for your kindness. (Applause)

    在联合国大会全体会议上
    赫鲁晓夫关于裁军问题的发言
    关于讨论裁军问题程序的发言
    新华社12日讯　塔斯社纽约11日讯：赫鲁晓夫1960年10月11日在联合国大会全体会议上关于讨论裁军问题的程序的发言，全文如下：主席先生！各位代表先生！
    我们正在决定一些需要在联合国大会全体会议上讨论的问题。裁军问题——这是问题的问题。苏联人民和社会主义阵营各国人民都是这样认为的。真诚地渴望保障世界巩固和平的各国人民也是这样想的。
    所以我们认为裁军问题必须在联合国大会全体会议上讨论，以便这个使各国人民感到不安的问题能在联合国大会本届会议的工作中占有主要地位。
    联合国大会是联合国的最高机构，它的成立不仅为了处理各国之间经常会发生的一些争端，而首先是为了解决保障和平的重要问题。
    在现在的条件下，裁军问题是最根本的问题，巩固和平能否得到保障取决于它的解决。任何问题，不管有多么重要，都不能同这个问题相比拟，因为新的世界大战是否爆发取决于这个问题。排除战争只能在这样的情况下才有可能：如果各国之间就裁军达成协议，如果裁军将在极严格的国际监督之下进行，使任何一个国家都不能暗中重新武装和再次威胁其他国家。
    苏联代表团已经把这个问题作为头等重要和刻不容缓的问题提交联合国大会全体会议讨论。我们今天呼吁所有代表了解这个问题的全部严肃性和刻不容缓性。
    洛奇先生曾说，由于联合国大会的议程上有七十九个问题，所以对裁军问题不能给予重视。当然，如果以这样态度对待裁军问题，如果以这样态度对待联合国的工作和这样来了解联合国的主要使命，那么老实说，这就意味着使联合国注定破产。在这种情况下，这个组织就不能担负起寄托于它的主要任务。
    联合国的主要职责就是保证和平。在保证和平的事业中，主要问题中的主要问题是达成关于在严格国际监督下裁军和销毁军备的协议。
    代表先生们，我们应该很好地理解所有这一切，因为这关乎和平的命运，关乎各国人民的命运。
    总务委员会建议的那条道路已经试探过多年了。各式各样的委员会讨论裁军问题有多少年了，但是这些委员会在实际解决这个问题上作了许多事情吗？不多、很少、可以说什么也没有作。因此，苏联政府希望，所有国家终于会意识到它们的责任，意识到裁军问题的全部重要性，并在大会全体会议上予以讨论。
    如果将继续拖延裁军问题，正如问题拖延到目前那样，那就有使事件朝着在第二次世界大战前国际联盟时代的那种方向发展的危险。印度总理尼赫鲁先生在本届会议上的发言中非常令人信服地谈到了这点。也就是存在着这种危险：联合国在裁军问题上将会沿着国际联盟的老牛破车走过的道路走去。
    因此我们必须特别努力，把车轮子从深陷的轨道中拉出来，并把它放在能保证达成裁军协议的道路上。
    我想告诉代表先生们，现在形成了非常复杂的局面。现在正讨论的是一些次要的、枝节的问题。没有一天不再聚集着越来越多的武器，没有一天不产生新的挑衅，这种种挑衅不是促进裁军问题的解决，而是妨碍裁军问题的解决，加深紧张程度，加剧冷战，扩大军备竞赛。
    很难使那些渴望和平、也就是渴望解决保障和平的一切问题的人们相信，联合国没有时间讨论全面彻底裁军这样极其重要的问题。大家都记得，曾经花费了多少时间去讨论是否值得把蒋介石傀儡保留在联合国的问题，虽然一切思想健全的人都明白，早就应该恢复人民中国的合法权利了，因为人民中国的政府代表着全中国人民。曾经连续多年讨论这个问题，在每届联大这个问题都占去不少的时间。中国在联合国的合法权利迄今没有恢复，其主要责任要美国及其军事集团的盟国来负。
    西方国家的代表没有时间讨论裁军问题，但是为了保持国际紧张局势，不让各国之间的关系正常化，它们却不吝惜时间。他们通过自己的活动造成了一种使将来无法达成裁军协定的局面。美国政府仍然奉行着杜勒斯的“战争边缘”政策。大家知道，在任何边缘上都容易跌下去的，到那时可能爆发世界大战，给人类带来无穷的灾难。
    请看看其他类似的“问题”，这些问题也是联合国多年所讨论的，但是除了臭气熏天，除了毒化国际气氛以外，没有得到任何结果。我这里所指的是所谓匈牙利问题、西藏问题和美国挑衅活动的能手正在东寻西找的其他类似问题。他们竭尽全力使联合国的注意力集中到这些问题上，转移联合国对国际真正重要的和刻不容缓的问题的注意。但是大家明白，这类问题不能导致国际紧张局势的缓和，相反，它却包含着纠纷和敌对的种子和人为地制造国际紧张局势。某些集团企图用这种办法继续“冷战”。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    现在是大家该了解当前局势的严重性的时候了。
    出席联合国大会的大多数国家首脑和政府首脑已经返回本国，其他的人也准备动身，这种情况表明，他们显然对联合国大会本届会议不信任，对全面彻底裁军问题这样一个迫切的问题能否进行有效地讨论不怀希望。
    但是，这种情况是可以改变的，因为现在的交通工具既提供了迅速飞去的可能，也提供了迅速返回的可能。我相信，如果在联大全体会议上认真提出裁军问题，并给予这个问题以特殊的紧急意义，那末，已经离开这里的政府和国家首脑可能回到大会上来。甚至在开始时没有参加本届会议的国家和政府首脑也可能前来。
    这个问题也可以用另外的方式解决。关于这点，我同英国首相麦克米伦先生，同其他国家领导人，以及在联合国记者协会的记者招待会上都已经谈过了。也许，在联大紧急会议上讨论全面彻底裁军问题是合宜的。
    现在，美国由于准备总统选举而产生了这样一种局面：美国政府看来不愿承担什么新的重要义务。而如果没有美国的建设性的参加，联合国大会上就不能达成裁军协议。
    联大紧急会议不妨在明年3、4月间召开，建议各国的国家首脑或政府首脑担任出席这次会议的代表团的团长。
    必须力争在联大紧急会议上达成裁军协议，使每个国家能对达成裁军协议和保障世界和平的共同事业作出重大的贡献。
    我想，所有致力于和平和各国人民友谊的人，都会欢迎关于召开联合国大会紧急会议的这个决定。
    我还想重复一点，最好在欧洲，譬如在日内瓦召开这次会议，因为大多数加入联合国的国家，在地理上是接近欧洲的。可以在莫斯科或列宁格勒举行这次会议。如果这样，我们方面将尽一切力量来为联大会议的正常工作，为所有参加这次会议的代表创造应有的条件。
    总之，苏联代表团坚主必须在有政府首脑参加的联大全体会议上讨论全面彻底裁军问题。如果由于这种或那种原因未能在这次会议上全面讨论裁军问题并至少在主要原则上达成协议，那末，苏联政府认为有必要召开联合国大会紧急会议来把一个问题——全面彻底裁军问题提交会议讨论。
    我呼吁你们，代表先生们，意识到联合国在解决像裁军这样一个极重要的问题方面的全部责任。世界各国人民期待联合国终于能铺平通向解决全面彻底裁军这样一项迫切的重要任务的道路。
    关于裁军问题的答辩发言
    新华社12日讯　塔斯社纽约11日讯：赫鲁晓夫10月11日在联合国大会会议上行使答辩权利，就裁军问题发言，全文如下：主席先生！各位代表先生！
    我注意地听取了这里的发言。西方国家的代表主要是反对我们关于在大会全体会议上讨论裁军问题的建议。这些人在辩论方面是很老练的。他们说，苏联把裁军问题提到联大全体会议上讨论是为了宣传目的。但是，他们自己就是这样一些宣传家，他们像俗话所说的，宣传自己的观点是他们的拿手好戏。（场内笑声）
    现在，有人“塞给”代表们一个问题，以便引起争论，这个问题是，在联合国的哪一个机构中讨论裁军问题更好：在联大全体会议上还是在第一委员会？这是一种无益的争论！对于我们，在这个问题上没有争论；我们希望哪里能够尽快地找到解决这个迫切问题的办法，并且这个问题的解决真正有利于各国人民，就在哪里讨论这个问题。
    这样，你们可能向我提出问题：为什么我们非要坚持在联大全体会议上讨论这个问题，而不同意到委员会去？原因很简单。我们也曾在委员会讨论过。我们已经知道，请原谅我粗鲁地比喻，这好比一个马厩，我们知道它的味道，在委员会我们得不到任何结果。
    你们知道，我们曾经在有英、美、加拿大、法、苏联参加的一个五国委员会里呆过。我们在这个委员会里开过多年的会，甚至在最初就商定，有关在这个委员会进行的辩论情况不向报界发表，不准带出这个委员会的范围。我们经过考虑，并且真诚地认为，参加这个委员会工作的人，上述国家的代表将真的会注意在讨论裁军问题时不引起尖锐化，而是为迅速达成协议创造更好的条件。
    可是结果怎样呢？
    美国在五国委员会中有最好的代表——史塔生先生。但是，他终于离开了这个委员会，更正确地说，是“把他撤职了”，因为他不同意强加给他的坚持前美国国务卿已故杜勒斯的观点的做法。
    我们看到，这个委员会唯一认真做的一件事是喝茶，喝咖啡。（场内笑声）开会，开会，一个人讲，另一个人听，第三个人要求把会议移到第二天。就这样，没个完。那里开了几年会，我知道得不准确，但是我们没有坚持下去。有这样一种也许是不大客气的说法——让我们不理睬这个机构，并从那里退出来，因为这不是一个解决裁军问题的机构，而是欺骗舆论、欺骗人民、工人阶级、劳动农民、知识分子，欺骗一切真正希望裁军的人的幌子。而我们不希望参与这种骗局。（掌声）
    我看到这里坐着儒勒·莫克，他是社会党人，他在十国委员会上费了许多口舌，结果怎样呢？一无所得。（场内欢跃、掌声）
    我和法兰西共和国总统戴高乐先生会见后，我们对某些问题表明了共同的了解。为了达成裁军协议，必须从销毁核武器运载工具开始实现这一协议。我现在仍然支持法国总统戴高乐先生的这种主张。
    儒勒·莫克先生此后在记者招待会上或者是还在什么地方，确切的地点我已经不记得，他自己知道得更清楚，又重申过戴高乐先生的话。我们很高兴，因为法国通过自己的总统，后来又通过它在裁军委员会上的代表把这宣布给大家。这就是说，我们曾经认为，有一个参加大西洋军事集团的伙伴表现了相互谅解。但是我们的希望破灭了。儒勒·莫克来到委员会后，所说的却完全是另一番话。这是另一个儒勒·莫克，不是当众讲话的那个，而是另一个，这个儒勒·莫克多年来坐在委员会里，并在设法破坏裁军谈判。
    诸位先生！我们还有一点耐力，还有最后的希望使联大能够在它的全体会议上帮助达成裁军协议，以便最后使人类免遭战争的浩劫。诸位先生，我再重复一遍，如果爆发战争，那这种战争将蔓延全球。许多人想像不到未来的战争是怎样的。我在具体地设想这种战争。苏联是不怕战争的！如果有人把战争强加给我们，我们就为自己的国家而战。无论我们付出多大的牺牲，我们也要取得胜利！（掌声）
    但是不能忘记，在这种战争中损失将是不可估计的，我们坐在这里的人也将要对此负责。的确，从在座的某些人身上能得到些什么。历史是不会宽恕他们这一点的！我要强调指出：我们认为必须在联合国大会上，在它的全体会议上讨论裁军问题。
    在这里发过言的有加拿大代表格林先生，还有美国代表，他的名字发音很难，因此我不想讲出来，以免把舌头弄破。（场内活跃）我想任何人也不会猜错，我讲的是谁。那么他们要说，赫鲁晓夫也打算走啊。是的，我打算在星期四，10月13日回莫斯科。但是，如果你们真正希望裁军，那么我不仅延期回莫斯科，而且要在这里开到达成裁军协议为止。（掌声）
    我们国内的形势很好。我这个部长会议主席已经不在国内一个月了，而国内的事情进行得好极了，因此需要我在这里逗留多久，我就可以逗留多久，以便达成裁军协议。在我们国家，事情一年比一年，一天比一天地好。（掌声）
    我们认为，争取裁军的斗争不是宣传。而你们提出匈牙利和西藏问题，正如波兰外交部长腊帕茨基所质问的，是为了播种和平和相互谅解的种子吗？不是的，你们搬出这些问题是想引起各国的纠纷。请提吧，我们不怕这样的问题。我们不是用红布就可以戏弄的牡牛，谁逗它就向谁扑来。我们是共产党人，我们的头脑是健全的；我们经受过斗争的考验。我们同白匪打过四年仗，我们打倒和粉碎了工人阶级的敌人，而你们却想用辩论会来吓唬我们！可是，诸位先生，你们知道，你们在这方面，如果可以这样比喻的话，腰太细了。（欢跃，掌声）
    你们为什么要提出西藏问题？不过，我再说一遍，请提吧，如果这对你们需要的话。我在纽约游览时看到美国人嘴里一动一动地嚼着口香糖，——这是他们的习惯。而现在你们却想给大会代表的嘴里塞上一块棉花来代替口香糖，以便让他们坐在那里嚼棉花。（场内笑声）谁有兴趣谁就来吧，谁愿意，谁就试试吧，而我们是不会干这种事的。
    诸位先生！我们必须唤醒那些在这里昏昏欲睡的人；必须唤醒在座的人——人民派他们到联大来开会是让他们来讨论裁军问题，可是天晓得他们却在纽约闲逛，而由人民给他们出钱。
    诸位先生，我说，你们了解裁军的必要性的时候就要到来。人民将摒弃那些在通向和平和相互谅解的道路上制造障碍和不为裁军协议创造条件的人。
    我们，社会主义世界的人们是不会被你们吓倒的！我们的经济是繁荣的，我们的技术是不断发展的，我们的人民是团结的。你们想把军备竞赛强加于我们，我们不愿意，但是，我们也不怕。我们定会打败你们！我们已在成批地生产火箭。不久前我在一个工厂里看到，那里生产火箭就像自动机器制造香肠一样，火箭一个挨着一个从我们工厂的作业线上送出来。
    有人想试试我们在地球上站得怎么样，你们试过我们之后就会被我们粉碎。我指的是，粉碎了那些在十月革命最初年代里对我们进行战争的美国、法国、英国、德国、日本的帝国主义者。我们粉碎了它们的军队，并且像扫垃圾一样把他们从我们神圣的土地上扫了出去。如果帝国主义者现在再进行这种侵略，那么，我们就再一次粉碎侵略者，而且粉碎得更厉害。
    有些先生们现在开始喋喋不休地说，赫鲁晓夫在威胁别人。不，赫鲁晓夫不是威胁人，而是现实地向你们预言未来。如果你们不了解现实局势，不创造条件就裁军问题达成协议，事情就会更加复杂，因为，如果不裁军，就意味着将进行军备竞赛，而一切军备竞赛归根结蒂将导致战争。如果战争爆发，那时，这里在座的很多人将不见了。
    清醒一下吧，如果你们难以抑制瞌睡，那就捏一下易痛处。这里很多人听惯了谄媚的话，我不愿意姑息这些人，不愿意在世界处于灾祸边缘的时候来迎合这些人。如果有人对我讲的话不高兴，这就是说，我达到了我的目的——我就是这样希望的！
    有什么可以补充的呢？
    不久以前从帝国主义的压迫下解放出来的亚洲人民和非洲人民现在还不是全都意识到了自己的力量，还在跟着他们昨天的绞刑吏——殖民主义者走。但是，今天这样，明天就不会这样了。那时，不是这样了，人民会昂起头来，挺起胸膛，要成为局势的真正主人。先生们，请注意，不远的将来就会这样。
    投票赞成在第一委员会中讨论这个问题，这是你们的事。我们丝毫不反对第一委员会，毫不反对，我甚至不知道哪里好些，哪里差些：在第一委员会里好，还是在大会上好。我们只是说，第一委员会已经尝试过了。那里没有任何结果。因此，为了再一次替人民谋幸福，我们希望把这个问题提交大会全体会议讨论。如果你们又把我们赶进这个委员会，我们有权利参加这个委员会的工作或者不参加。如果我们看到，这个委员会被变成欺骗人民的幌子，只是空谈裁军，而实际上同过去一样什么也不干，我们就退出这个委员会。我们不做幌子，不欺骗全世界劳动人民。（掌声）
    加拿大、美国、英国的代表都在这里发了言，他们竟把自己描绘成正直人。这是些殖民主义者，他们很富，而殖民地很穷，因为殖民主义者掠夺了这些殖民地。他们在这里却把自己描绘成“好心肠的菩萨”。然而，正直的人看出了这些人的本来面目。
    是的，我们退出了五国委员会。为什么退出呢？因为你们，先生们，把这个委员会变成了马厩。你们在那里搞得臭气熏天，使一个真诚的人没有办法呼吸，所以我们退出了。新鲜空气吸引着我们，吸引着我们这些诚实的人们，劳动人民的忠诚的儿子。我们退出来了，不再到那里去了。
    先生们，如果在第一委员会中将讨论裁军问题，那末我们将在最初阶段参加，我们要看一看那里的讨论如何进行。
    可能，有必要通过决议，扩大十国裁军委员会。顺便说说，我们曾经建议由十五个国家的代表组成这个委员会。我们同意参加这个委员会，条件是：那里应有中立国家的代表参加，像我们建议的那样。
    如果大会通过决议，要世界各国承担在国际监督下实现裁军和销毁武器的义务的话，这个委员会就能够顺利地工作。
    需要什么样的国际监督呢？我再说一遍，如果通过了全面彻底裁军和销毁武器的决定，我们就同意任何监督。你们就是挑出一些仇恨共产主义和社会主义的狂徒来，我们也相信他们，让他们来拟定监督方案。对裁军的国际监督越深入越广泛，就越能保证各国人民的希望，使任何一个国家都不能秘密制造武器，不能用新战争威胁任何邻居。
    我们不害怕监督，然而是对裁军的监督，是通过了裁军决定以后的监督。因此，裁军必须在监督下进行。
    麦克米伦先生在这个讲坛上提出了什么建议呢？他在同我谈话时也这样说：赫鲁晓夫先生，您太着急了，这样的事情不能很快就解决。他说，必须这样：让我们聚集在一起，建立政治委员会；让我们建立科学委员会。这个科学委员会就来决定，怎样弄死跳蚤最好，是扯断它的脚呢，还是掐掉它的头呢？（全场活跃）。这当然是个“科学问题”，先生们，可是，这只对那些不愿裁军的人才合适。因此，我对麦克米伦先生说：您想把我们拖到既没有光线又没有空气，只有害怕光线的蝙蝠居住的迷宫里去。你想要我们到那里参加研究如何走到裁军的科学问题。而这据说需要五年到十年。
    先生们，如果等待五年或十年，那时可以肯定说，我们不能达成裁军协议。如果现在实际上只有三个国家有原子武器，而第四个国家已经开始进行原子试验，那末我相信，过五年到十年后将会有数十个这样的国家。那时要达成协议就更困难了。
    现在火箭、导弹可以达到地球的任何点，而且我们可以把自己的宇宙飞船送上任何一个角落。而五年到十年以后怎样呢？先生们，你们应该切合实际地想想这点。因此，你们如果真正希望和平，这里不是所有的人都希望和平，但是也许大多数人都希望和平，那么我要对这大多数人说：发出你们争取裁军的呼声，人类会感谢你们的。如果你们跟随帝国主义垄断资本家（他们的代表在这里发过言）和跟着北大西洋军事集团走的话，人们就会咒骂你们，因为，他们把最神圣的东西——和平重托给你们，而你们却辜负了人民的希望，没有达成裁军协议，并把人类引向战争。
    先生们，这就要二者择其一。请决定吧！
    我感谢你们的盛意。（掌声）
