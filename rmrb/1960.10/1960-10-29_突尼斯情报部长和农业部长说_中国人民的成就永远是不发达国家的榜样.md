It was Kennani's third visit to the Chinese Pavilion.

Masmoudi greatly appreciated the "Red Flag" sedan produced during China's Great Leap Forward. Kennani watched the pictures about the People's Communes for a long time, and inquired in detail about the organization and development of the People's Communes; the exhibits of agricultural products and the models of water conservancy projects also greatly interested the Minister of Agriculture.

Both ministers wrote down their impressions in the visitor's book after the visit. Masmoudi wrote: "Every year I come to visit the Chinese Pavilion, and every year I see the great progress of the great People's Republic of China. The friends in charge of the Chinese Pavilion are the best messengers of the Chinese people's friendship and hospitality. The printing press (given by China to the Tunisian Ministry of Information) is a permanent symbol of the Chinese people's friendship and affection left in our Ministry of Information. We find that Chinese equipment is very strong and very suitable for countries like ours to use. May the friendship between our two countries further develop and consolidate, which is in the best interests of both our countries. Once again, I cheer for your Great Leap Forward." Kennani wrote: "I admire the great efforts made by China. These efforts are increasingly contributing to the people, to the elimination of colonialism, and to the defense of world peace. The achievements of the Chinese people will always be an example for all underdeveloped countries."

    突尼斯情报部长和农业部长说
    中国人民的成就永远是不发达国家的榜样
    新华社讯　突尼斯情报部长穆罕默德·马斯穆迪和农业部长阿卜德萨拉姆·肯纳尼，21日在参加突尼斯国际博览会的中国代表团团长于黎光的陪同下，参观了中国馆。肯纳尼参观中国馆已经是第三次了。
    马斯穆迪非常欣赏中国大跃进的产品“红旗牌”轿车。肯纳尼长久地观看关于人民公社的图片，详细地询问关于人民公社的组织和发展情况；展览馆展出的农产品实物和水利工程的模型也使这位农业部长很感兴趣。
    这两位部长参观后都在留言簿上写下了他们的观感。马斯穆迪写道：“每年我都来中国馆参观，每年我都看到伟大的中华人民共和国的巨大进步。负责中国馆的朋友们都是中国人民友谊和好客情意的最好的使者。中国（赠给突尼斯情报部的）印刷机是在我们情报部留下的中国人民的友谊和情意的永久标志。我们发现中国的器材很牢固，非常适合像我们这样的国家使用。愿我们两国间的友谊进一步发展和巩固，那是符合我们两国最大的利益的。我再一次为你们的大跃进欢呼。”肯纳尼写道：“我钦佩中国所作出的巨大努力。这些努力日益为人民、为消灭殖民主义、为保卫世界和平作出贡献。中国人民所取得的成就永远是各个不发达国家的榜样。”
    新华社突尼斯22日电　突尼斯外交事务国务秘书萨多克·莫卡德姆，今天在这里接见了参加突尼斯第八届国际博览会的中国展览团团长于黎光和副团长岳岱衡，并且同他们进行了亲切友好的谈话。
    莫卡德姆向中国展览团祝贺中国展览馆的成功。他说，突尼斯和中国有着悠久的历史关系。他强调指出，两国的这种关系在今天应该得到恢复和进一步发展。他说，两国人员的相互访问将有助于增进相互了解和加强现有的友好关系。他又说，中国馆的这次展出，将有助于加强这种关系。
    莫卡德姆对中国政府和人民支持兄弟的阿尔及利亚和以阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府，表示感谢。莫卡德姆还说，中国已经取得的和正在取得的建设成果和经验对于一个新近独立的年轻国家是非常有益的。
