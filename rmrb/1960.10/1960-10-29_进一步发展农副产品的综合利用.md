    Further Develop Comprehensive Utilization of Agricultural and Sideline Products

    During the summer harvest this year, this newspaper published editorials and commentator articles entitled "Vigorously Promote Comprehensive Utilization of Agricultural and Sideline Products" and "Comprehensive Utilization Has Unlimited Potential," explaining the possibility and necessity of comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products. Over the past few months, thanks to the attention of Party committees at all levels, and the efforts of various people's communes and relevant departments, this work has achieved remarkable results. Many grain processing factories have established comprehensive utilization workshops, and most rural communes have established small comprehensive utilization factories. These workshops and factories use agricultural and sideline products such as rice bran, rice husks, wheat straw, rapeseed pods, and corn husks to produce large quantities of non-staple foods such as oil, wine, sugar, sauce, and vinegar, as well as a large amount of feed, and some pharmaceuticals and chemical raw materials. The work of the past few months has not only comprehensively utilized various agricultural and sideline products, increasing social wealth, but also broadened people's horizons, creating many good experiences for further developing this work. Now is the final stage of the autumn harvest, which is the peak season for comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products. We plan to further discuss some ideological issues related to comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products, to help people carry out this work better.

    Some people doubt the possibility of vigorously promoting comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products. This is because they have not fully seen the new and changed social conditions. For many years, people have mostly focused on using the main parts of various crops, such as cotton mainly for cotton wadding, rice and wheat mainly for grains, and other parts generally used as fuel and fodder, or simply discarded. Some people also know that comprehensive utilization has many benefits, but they either lack equipment, lack technical knowledge, or lack organization, making it either impossible to carry out or only carrying out a little bit in a piecemeal fashion, with little effect. Now, relying on the powerful strength of the people's communes, it is possible to solve technical and equipment problems, and to carry out unified planning and rational division of labor, fully utilizing the natural resources that could not be utilized in the old society, and expanding the single and simple utilization of crops to comprehensive and integrated utilization. Since the summer harvest this year, Shanghai has vigorously promoted comprehensive utilization of crop stalks, producing many important industrial raw materials, including alcohol, and has also obtained more than 46 million catties of distiller's grains, plus some other feed, providing enough feed for 120,000 pigs. They plan to more widely utilize agricultural and sideline products this autumn and winter to solve the feed needs of 300,000 pigs.

    Some people feel that after comprehensive utilization, things that were useless have become useful, and things that were of little use have become of great use, which feels somewhat mysterious. This is because they lack the necessary scientific knowledge. Many things that were originally only used as fuel or fodder, such as sesame, rapeseed, and rice and wheat stalks, become good feed once processed; many things that were originally only used as feed, such as rice bran and rice husks, produce oil, wine, and other products after processing, and the remaining residue is still good feed. According to comparative experiments by the Fujian Agricultural Science Department, pigs fed with rice bran gain an average of 10.66 taels per head per day, while pigs fed with bran cake after oil extraction gain an average of 11.3 taels per head per day. What is the reason for this? Originally, the various components contained in general feed, including grains, cannot be fully absorbed by livestock. The nutrients needed by livestock are often not fully available in a single type of feed, so people always combine several types of feed when feeding livestock, which both meets the needs of livestock and rationally utilizes materials. Taking rice bran as an example, judging from its main components, it should be said to be good feed; however, the fat content of rice bran is about 18% to 20%, which pigs cannot absorb. The oil yield of rice bran is about 10%, and the fat remaining in the bran cake can fully meet the needs of pigs. Moreover, after crop stalks and husks are used for brewing wine, the fiber softens, making it easier for pigs to digest, and the distiller's grains contain a large amount of yeast, which is rich in nutrients, so pigs gain weight more easily when eating distiller's grains. This is the reason.

    Some people believe that the "profit" from comprehensive utilization is not large, and the product quality will not be very high, therefore they doubt whether it is worth vigorously promoting. This is because they do not understand the actual situation. Many facts prove that the "profit" from comprehensive utilization is quite significant. Guangdong has extracted more than 17 million catties of rice bran oil from the second half of last year to now, refining more than 14 million catties of edible oil, which is equivalent to the oil production of more than 100,000 mu of rapeseed. The estimated cotton production in Shaanxi Province this year is 2 million dan. If wild and miscellaneous fibers are fully utilized, 1 million dan can be obtained, which is equivalent to half of the cotton production. Can it be said that this number is small? As for the quality, it is not absolute. At the beginning, due to lack of experience and unfamiliarity with technology, the quality of certain products may be lower; as long as we rely on the masses and continuously improve, the quality will gradually improve. It should also be seen that society's needs for products are diverse, some requiring more refinement, some requiring more coarseness; some needing high-grade products, some not needing high-grade products. For example, the cotton stalk bark from comprehensive utilization, the good parts can be used to weave fine cloth, the second-best parts can be made into packaging cloth, and the worst parts can be used as hemp knives or made into fiber felt. In short, anything that society needs should be fully utilized to serve socialist construction.

    Comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products has so many benefits, but can we use anything we see? No, we shouldn't. For the material resources of each region, we should plan comprehensively and arrange overall: Which things should be used as feed? Which should be used as fuel? Which should be comprehensively utilized, with the processed products used as feed? All of these should be investigated and calculated clearly, taking care of the needs of all aspects, and there should be no bias. This year, the disaster situation in some areas is severe, and livestock feed must be guaranteed and cannot be processed for other purposes. Comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products should mobilize the broad masses to participate, and make full use of the existing equipment (stoves, threshing sheds, mills, etc.) of rural canteens to achieve the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results.

### 进一步发展农副产品的综合利用

    进一步发展农副产品的综合利用
    今年夏收期间，本报发表了“大搞农副产品的综合利用”、“综合利用潜力无穷”的社论和评论员文章，说明综合利用农副产品的可能性和必要性。几个月来，由于各级党委的重视，由于各个人民公社和有关部门的努力，这项工作已经取得显著成绩。很多粮食加工厂设立了综合利用车间，多数农村公社建立了小型综合利用工厂。这些车间和工厂，利用米糠、稻壳、麦秸、油菜荚、玉米皮等农副产品，生产了大量的油、酒、糖、酱、醋等副食品，生产了大量饲料，还生产了部分医药、化工原料。几个月的工作，一方面综合利用了各种农副产品，增加了社会财富；一方面开扩了人们的眼界，为进一步开展这项工作创造了不少好经验。现在是秋收最后阶段，正是进行农副产品综合利用的旺季，我们打算进一步谈谈有关农副产品综合利用的一些思想问题，帮助人们把这件事情更好地开展起来。
    有些人怀疑大搞农副产品综合利用的可能性。这是由于他们没有充分看到新的变化了的社会条件。多少年来，人们对于各种农作物，大都注意利用它们的主要部分，如棉花主要利用棉絮，稻麦主要利用籽粒，其他部分一般用作燃料和饲草，或者干脆丢掉了。有些人也知道综合利用有许多好处，可是，一缺乏设备，二不懂技术，三没有组织，或者根本搞不起来，或者零敲碎打地搞一点，效果不大。现在，依靠人民公社的强大力量，可以解决技术、设备问题，可以进行统一计划和合理分工，把旧社会无法利用的自然资源充分利用起来，把农作物的单一利用和简单利用扩大到全面利用和综合利用。今年夏收以来，上海市大搞农作物秸秆的综合利用，生产了包括酒精在内的不少重要工业原料，还取得了四千六百多万斤酒糟，加上一部分别的饲料，使十二万头猪有了足够的饲料。他们准备在今年秋冬更广泛地利用农副产品，解决三十万头猪需要的饲料。
    有些人看到综合利用以后，没用的东西有用了，用处小的东西用处大了，感到有些玄妙。这是由于他们缺乏必要的科学知识。很多原来只是用作燃料或饲草的东西，如芝麻、油菜、稻麦的秸秆，一经加工，就变成了很好的饲料；很多原来只是用作饲料的米糠稻壳等等，经过加工，出产了油、酒等产品，剩下的渣滓仍然是很好的饲料。据福建农业科学部门的对比试验，用米糠喂猪，每头每天平均增膘十两六钱六，而用榨油后的糠饼喂猪，每头每天平均增膘十一两三。这是怎么回事呢？原来，一般饲料，包括粮食在内，它们含有的各种成分，并不能为牲畜全部吸收。牲畜需要的营养，常常又不是某一种饲料完全具备的，所以人们喂牲畜的时候，总要把几种饲料配合使用，既能适合牲畜的需要，又合理地利用了物资。拿米糠来说，从它的主要成分看来，应该说是好饲料；但是，米糠的脂肪含量约为18％到20％，这是猪吸收不了的。米糠的出油率约为10％左右，糠饼中剩下的脂肪，完全可以满足猪的需要。而且作物秸秆糠壳酿酒以后，纤维软化，猪吃了还容易消化，酒糟中含有大量酵母，酵母富有营养，猪吃糠糟格外增膘，道理就在这里。
    有些人认为综合利用“油水”不大，产品质量不会很高，因此怀疑是否值得大搞。这是由于他们不了解实际情况。许多事实证明，综合利用的“油水”是很不小的。广东从去年下半年到现在，共榨米糠油一千七百多万斤，炼成食用油一千四百多万斤，相当十几万亩油菜的产油量。陕西省今年的棉花产量估计为二百万担，如果把野杂纤维加以充分利用，可得一百万担，相当棉花产量的一半，能说这个数字很小么？至于质量高低，并不是绝对的。开始由于经验不足，技术不熟，某些产品质量可能低些；只要依靠群众，不断改进，质量就会逐步提高。还要看到，社会对产品的需要是多种多样的，有的要求精一些，有的要求粗一些；有的需要高级的，有的并不需要高级的。比如，综合利用的棉秆皮，好的部分可以纺织细布，次的部分可以制成包装布，再次的可以用做麻刀或制成纤维毡。总之，只要是社会需要的东西，都应当充分利用起来，使其为社会主义建设服务。
    综合利用农副产品有这许多好处，是不是可以看见什么就利用什么呢？也不是。对于各个地区的物质资源，应该通盘筹划，全面安排：哪些东西用作饲料？哪些用作燃料？哪些应当综合利用，而以处理后的产品作饲料？都应该调查计算清楚，照顾各个方面的需要，不应有所偏废。今年部分地区灾情严重，牲畜饲料必须保证，不能为别的用途处理掉了。综合利用农副产品应当发动广大群众参加，尽量利用农村食堂的旧有设备（锅灶、碾棚、磨坊等），达到多快好省的要求。
