Xinhua News Agency, Moscow - Soviet industrial departments have recently manufactured many new machines with a high degree of automation and mechanization.

    In the metallurgical industry, a roughing mill controlled by a program calculation device is about to be manufactured at the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant. The entire process of this machine, from ingot loading to material output, is automated, and its production capacity is twice as high as that of existing roughing mills.

    Soviet experts have for the first time adopted an automated system for electric arc furnace steelmaking. This system consists of a series of electronic instruments that can change the electrical, thermal, physical, and chemical parameters in the electric arc furnace. Preliminary statistics show that it can increase the furnace's productivity by 30% and reduce power consumption by 15%.

    Since the stability of the temperature in the heating furnace affects the quality of the rolled material, a new device has been developed that can automatically control the furnace temperature. It can calculate the heat of the billet in the heating furnace at each stage and ensure that it reaches the required temperature when it is discharged from the furnace.

    In the mining industry, a group of experts in Moscow has designed an automatic combined machine for coal mines. As long as one person performs remote control on the ground, this machine can grind coal into powder like a "mill," and then use a strong compressed air flow to transport the coal powder through pipelines for use by thermal power stations.

    In Shiyagou City, an automated machine has been manufactured that can arbitrarily change the direction of the wellbore during the drilling process. With it, many branch wells can be drawn from a main well in all directions. A mine in Uzbekistan tested an automatic machine tool. As long as kerosene and oxygen are poured into it, high temperature is generated after combustion, and this high temperature is used to destroy the most solid rock formations. The drilling speed can reach four meters per hour, which is several times higher than the efficiency of mechanical drilling.

    A newly manufactured artesian well drilling rig can drill thirty to forty meters of artesian wells in twenty hours (it used to take at least thirty days to drill such deep wells). The main feature of this machine is that, in addition to using the previous drilling methods, it also uses the oscillation method, which can reduce the drilling cost by nine-tenths.

    A group of engineers in Baku manufactured a small device for exploiting self-spraying oil and gas wells. Its weight is about half of the currently used equipment, and its size is one-third of the existing equipment, but its strength is not reduced at all. It withstood 400 atmospheres during the test. These types of small devices are also popular in the world market.

    In the machinery manufacturing industry, the Karaganda Scientific Research Institute has manufactured a remote control instrument for measuring the load undertaken by machine parts. The sensor of this instrument changes its shape according to the load size, so that a curve appears on the indicating meter. Its characteristic is that it can quickly point out the changes that occur in easily worn parts during movement and work. (Attached picture)

    The automated workshop of the Krasnodar "Agricultural Machinery Chain" Factory in the Soviet Union has installed seven automatic production lines, which only require six workers to operate. The picture shows the production of bushing chains using an automatic combined machine.

    把现有的生产能力再提高一步
    苏工业部门制成多种自动化新机器
    据新华社莫斯科讯　苏联各工业部门近来制造出许多自动化、机械化程度很高的新机器。
    在冶金工业中，一台用程序计算装置操纵的初轧机即将在乌拉尔重型机器制造厂中制造出来。这台机器从装锭到出材全部过程都是自动化的，它的生产能力比现有的初轧机要高一倍。
    苏联专家们首次采用了电弧炉炼钢自动化的系统，这种系统是由一系列电子仪器组成的，它能改变电弧炉中的电、热、物理和化学的参数，据初步统计，它可使炉子的生产率提高30％，电力消耗减少15％。
    由于加热炉中温度稳定与否影响到轧材的质量，现在已经研究出了一种能自动控制加热炉炉温的新装置，它能算出加热炉中的毛坯在各个阶段的热量，并使它在出炉时达到所需要的温度。
    在采掘工业方面，莫斯科的一批专家设计了一种煤矿中用的自动联合机，只要一个人在地面进行远距离操纵，这台机器就能像“磨坊”一样把煤磨成粉末，然后用强力的压缩气流把煤粉通过管道运出，供火电站使用。
    在石山口市，制成了一种在钻井过程中能使井筒任意改变方向的自动化机器，用它可从一个主井朝各个方向引出许多支井。乌兹别克的一个矿井试验了一台自动机床，只要往里面灌进煤油和氧气，燃烧后就产生高温，利用这种高温来破坏最坚固的岩层，钻进速度可达每小时四米，比机械钻进的效率高数倍。
    新制成的一种自流井钻机能在二十小时内钻进三十到四十米的自流井（过去钻这样深的井至少要三十天）。这种机器的主要特点在于：它除了运用过去的钻井法以外，还采用了震荡法，它能使钻井成本降低十分之九。
    巴库的一批工程师制造了一种开采自喷石油井和瓦斯井用的小型装置，它的重量约为现在采用的设备的一半，大小为现有设备的三分之一，但坚固的程度一点也不减小，它在试验时经受住了四百个大气压。这类小型装置在世界市场上也很受欢迎。
    在机器制造业中，卡拉干达科学研究所制成了一种为测量机器部件所承担的负荷使用的远距离操纵仪器，这种仪器的传感器会根据负荷大小改变形状，从而使指示表上出现曲线。它的特点是能够较快地指出易磨损的部件在运动和工作过程中发生的变化。（附图片）
    苏联克拉斯诺达尔“农业机械链条”厂的自动化车间安装了七条自动作业线，只需要六个工人操纵。图是使用自动联合机生产轴衬链。
