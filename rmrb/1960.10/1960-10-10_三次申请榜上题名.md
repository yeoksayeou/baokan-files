　　On September 15th, Yan Airong picked up her pen to write her application to return to her hometown to support agriculture. This was her third application. The application was filled with enthusiasm: “Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. I am determined to return to the front line of agriculture, please approve my request. I guarantee to listen to the Party. If the Party approves my request, I will gladly go to my new labor post; if the Party needs me to stay, I will also work with peace of mind!”

　　Yan Airong is a twenty-year-old girl and a member of the Communist Youth League. In the past, she was able to do everything in the countryside, from plowing to transplanting rice seedlings. She even won second place in the rice transplanting competition in her commune. This year, in February, due to the needs of industrial construction, she was transferred to Nanning City to work as an assistant worker in the Fourth Work Section of the First Engineering Division of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Construction and Installation Engineering Company. Yan Airong realized that since the Party called on her to engage in industry, she should contribute as much as she could. She was not afraid of difficulties or tiredness, and worked like a little tiger. Due to her active labor, she was rated as an advanced producer in the second quarter of this year.

　　The Party put forward the call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. Through listening to reports and studying articles in the newspapers, Yan Airong clearly recognized the great significance of industry supporting agriculture. Before liberation, her mother and brother worked for the landlord, and her younger brother herded cattle for the landlord. When she was seven years old, her mother, to prevent the family from starving to death, painfully sold her to the landlord as a servant girl. The evil landlady forced this little girl to do heavy work and beat and kicked her all day long, making her life worse than that of a beast of burden. If it were not for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could this enslaved girl have the happy life she has today? Now, her brother works in a forest farm, her younger brother works in the railway, her hometown has established a people's commune, and her family does not have to worry about food and clothing, and their life is very good. She yearns for the beautiful prospects of communism, thinking: "To realize this wish as soon as possible, we must listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, vigorously develop agriculture and grain production." At the discussion meeting of the entire work section, she was the first to speak: "In order to accelerate the construction of socialism, the Party has put forward the call for the whole Party and the whole people to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. We young people must vigorously support agriculture! I request the leadership to approve me to go to the forefront of agricultural production. After I return to the countryside, I guarantee to take the lead in doing a good job in production and strive for a bumper grain harvest! I will also strive to become a pace-setter in agricultural production!" As soon as she finished speaking, warm applause broke out in the meeting place. Many people followed her and stood up to express their determination to go to the countryside.

　　Yan Airong wrote three applications to the Party branch of the work section. At study meetings, informal discussions, and Communist Youth League meetings, she spoke most actively and most positively, resolutely requesting to go to the countryside to support agricultural production increase. Just over an hour before the list was announced, the Party branch secretary consulted her: "Are you willing to stay, or be transferred to the countryside?" She firmly replied: "I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and I should take the lead in supporting agriculture!" The Party organization finally approved her request.

　　Seeing her name on the honor roll, Yan Airong was overjoyed. That night, the employees who were being transferred to the countryside held a forum. She and the girls and young men sang songs, held hands, and walked into the venue in groups. At the meeting, she once again expressed her determination to the Party: "We must settle down in the countryside, take root, and build a new socialist countryside!"

　　Now, she has gone to the front line of agricultural production, fulfilling her promise with her own practical actions. (Correspondent Group)

    三次申请榜上题名
    9月15日，言爱荣提起笔来写要求回乡支援农业的申请书，这已是写第三次啦。申请书上热情洋溢地写着：“农业是国民经济的基础。我决心回到农业第一线去，请党批准。我保证听党的话。党批准我去，我一定愉快地走上新的劳动岗位；要是党需要我留下来，我也一定安心工作！”
    言爱荣是个二十岁的姑娘，共青团员。过去她在农村里犁田、插秧，样样能干，曾经获得她所在公社的插秧能手比赛的第二名。今年2月，由于工业建设的需要，她被调到南宁市，在广西僮族自治区建筑安装工程公司一处四工段做副工。言爱荣认识到党叫她搞工业，她应该有一分热就发一分光。她不怕困难、不怕累，干起活来就像一只小老虎。由于劳动积极，今年第二季度她被评为先进生产者。
    党提出了大办农业、大办粮食的号召。言爱荣通过听报告，学习报纸上的文章，明确认识了工业支援农业的重大意义。解放前，她母亲和哥哥给地主做工，弟弟给地主放牛。她七岁那年，母亲为了不至于一家饿死，忍痛把她卖给地主做丫头。万恶的地主婆逼着这个小姑娘干沉重的活，还整天对她棒打脚踢，过着牛马不如的生活。要是没有共产党和毛主席，她这被奴役的女孩子哪会有今天的幸福生活？现在，她哥哥在林场劳动，弟弟在铁路工作，家乡成立了人民公社，她一家人不愁吃不愁穿，生活很好。她憧憬着共产主义的美好前景，心想：“要早日实现这个愿望，就得听党和毛主席的话，大办农业，大办粮食。”在全工段的讨论会上，她首先发言：“党为了加速建设社会主义，提出了全党全民大办农业大办粮食的号召。我们青年人要大力支援农业！我要求领导批准我到农业生产第一线去。我回到农村后，保证带头把生产搞好，争取粮食大丰收！还争取当上农业生产的标兵！”她的话音刚落，会场上立刻响起了热烈的掌声。许多人都跟着站起来表示决心要到农村去。
    言爱荣向工段党支部一连写了三次申请书。在学习会、漫谈会和共青团的会议上，她发言最活跃、最积极，坚决要求下乡去支援农业增产。在临公布名单的一个多小时前，党支部书记还征求她的意见：“你愿意留下，还是下放农村？”她坚定地回答说：“我是共青团员，应该带头去支援农业！”党组织终于批准了她的要求。
    看见光荣榜上有自己的名字，言爱荣心花怒放。当天晚上，下放农村的职工举行了座谈会。她和姑娘们、小伙子们唱着歌，手拉着手，成群结队地走进会场。在会上，她再一次向党表示决心：“要在农村安下心，扎下根，建设好社会主义的新农村！”
    现在，她已经走上了农业生产第一线，用自己的实际行动履行自己的诺言。　　（通组）
