    The Algerian People's Heroic Epic
    ——After Watching the Performance of the Algerian Art Troupe
    Lú Sù
    Algeria is a shining name in the hearts of our Chinese people: it is a heroic nation, our fighting brother in the struggle against imperialism. Although I have not been to Algeria, the common struggle against imperialism has long connected our hearts with the hearts of the Algerian people. Recently, Prime Minister Abbas visited our country again, and our government and the Algerian government issued a joint statement, the fighting friendship between our people and the Algerian people is developing and consolidating, and our ties are strengthening. But as we further strengthen our ties with the Algerian people, we feel that we should have a deeper understanding of the Algerian people, we always want to know more about the life of the Algerian people, we always want to understand more about the heroic struggles of the Algerian people, as well as Algerian culture and art, etc. It is with this feeling that we welcomed the distinguished guests of the Algerian Art Troupe, the cultural envoys of the Algerian people.
    I know very little about Algerian culture and art, but whenever I think of Algeria, I cannot help but think of the rumored "Arabian Night." Comrades, what is the Algerian "Arabian Night"? Everyone knows that Algeria's geographical location is in Africa, just as France is clearly in Europe. The Algerian people should be the masters of Algeria, which is as clear as France being the France of the French. However, because French imperialism invaded Algeria, in Algiers, the capital of Algeria, theaters and cinemas show French or European programs six days a week, and only one day is allowed to show Algerian programs. This day is called "Arabian Night!" It is said that during "Arabian Night," the secret agents of the French imperialist police are particularly busy, lurking in the dark places near the theater and cinema doors, secretly noting down the people who participate in "Arabian Night." That's the way it is! The Algerian people are oppressed and invaded by French imperialism equipped with American weapons, and the Algerian people's culture is of course also oppressed and invaded by imperialism. The Algerian people must rise up to resist imperialist aggression, and Algerian culture and art will naturally become the people's weapon of struggle. I must say that since I learned about the story of "Arabian Night," I have become even more strongly fond of the culture and art of the Algerian people. I think that art that is so hated by imperialism and so loved by the people must be good art.
    It was with this feeling that I watched the performance of the Algerian Art Troupe in Beijing.
    The performance of the Algerian Art Troupe is the greatest satisfaction for those who are eager to understand the struggle life of the Algerian people. This performance is an epitome of the Algerian people's struggle life and Algerian folk music and dance.
    The whole evening is divided into two parts: the first part is a one-act song and dance drama "Towards the Light," which contains rich Algerian folk songs and ethnic dances from various regions. The second part of the evening is a three-act drama "The Immortal Man," which mainly depicts the heroic struggle of the Algerian National Liberation Army. Their performance is in Arabic; we do not understand the Arabic language, but the authentic and profound performance of the Algerian artists broke the language barrier and gave us an extremely deep impression.
    The song and dance drama "Towards the Light" is a passionate and beautiful patriotic poem. The author portrays a heroic and unyielding Algerian youth who was unfortunately arrested for the Algerian national liberation struggle. The paratroopers of French imperialism tortured him, trying to make this fighting Algerian youth surrender to the executioners; even if he uttered a cry of pain. But "torture is ineffective on this kind of person," this Algerian youth did not cry out in pain, let alone beg for mercy. He despised the enemy's intimidation, and proudly thought of the motherland for which he shed blood and fought. The scene is constantly changing. With the tune of the Arabic flute, with the rapid drumbeats, it brings out many beautiful, strong, and lyrical folk songs and folk dances. The white robes of the musicians appear and disappear in the imagination of this Algerian youth. He thought of his own growth, of the classical dance his sister had danced, of how beautiful the days were without imperialist oppression; people could hold wedding ceremonies according to national customs, and the congratulators would sing until late at night; people danced to celebrate the harvest. The fighting Algerian does not care about the physical pain he suffers. The youth's heart is flying on the wings of music over the land of Algeria. For him, the Sahara is not a desolate desert. He thought that the people's labor would turn the desert into an oasis. He also thought of the joyful "Spring Dance." He thought: we should not only have pain, we should also have joy, but joy cannot be given by others, joy must be won by fighting, and the first thing to do is to drive away all invaders! The changing picture allows us and the protagonist of the play to see the majestic Kabylia Mountains. These mountainous areas not only have fascinating songs and dances, but also have excellent battles to strike the enemy. With the folk songs of the Aurès Mountains, we saw the steep cliffs of the Aurès Mountains. The folk songs of the Aurès are the national pride of Algeria, and the Aurès Mountains are the natural fighting fortress of the Algerians. The people there fight the most heroically...
    The Algerian people love singing and dancing and are good at singing and dancing. Look, how many beautiful and charming songs and dances have appeared in this song and dance drama. No wonder people often say that the people of Africa often sing and dance until late at night. But at the end of the entire song and dance drama, all the songs and dances stopped, and the plot changed drastically. The tortured youth became a soldier fighting with a gun. The poet (author) solemnly announced to us: today, people no longer dance, our children are doing their best to fight! The song and dance drama ends in the march of battle. Yes! Towards the light! Only by rising up to fight and persisting in fighting can we break through the darkness and move towards the light!
    A one-act song and dance drama has given me such a rich and profound impression.
    For the singing, playing, and dancing performances of the Algerian artists, I have only one word of praise: good! And I think there are many places worth learning from us.
    The second part of the evening is a multi-act drama "The Immortal Man." In this work, the author focuses on depicting the hero Kadour of the National Liberation Army. Kadour is a typical Algerian. He fights the enemy tirelessly, he bravely faces the enemy's attacks, and turns the sacrifices and pain of his family and the masses into the determination and strength to kill the enemy. "Our revolution is like this, from one ambush to another, from one battle to another; one person sacrifices, and another takes over, until the final victory..." Kadour is fighting like this. After Kadour heroically sacrificed, more people joined the battle in the place where he sacrificed. The play makes a very vivid description of the close relationship between the National Liberation Army and the people, and the unanimous fight of the masses. When watching this play, we clearly felt that the revolutionary struggle of the Algerian people is not only brave and resolute, but also full of strength and confidence in victory. The Algerian revolution will surely be victorious.
    This is a very rich drama. I think "The Immortal Man" faithfully reflects the current struggle of the Algerian people both in writing and in performance, which is its greatest success. As an audience, I firmly believe in what is happening on the stage, and I firmly believe that the artist himself is also a loyal fighter for national liberation. Watching "The Immortal Man" made me feel very kind; the life of the guerrillas, the training activities in the forest clearing, the enthusiastic discussions after a battle, the scene of the people's army being like fish in water with the help of the masses, and the image of the female soldiers with two braids and rolled up army sleeves, all show that we have had common experiences and common struggles. The fighting friendship between the Chinese people and the Algerian people is naturally existing, and this friendship is extremely strong and extremely profound; the Algerian artists have repeatedly strengthened this fraternal friendship with their noble labor.
    Through the entire performance of the art troupe, the excellent art of the Algerian people has left a very good impression on the Chinese audience. I feel that the road taken by the Algerian Art Troupe is correct: their efforts to "create the image of the Algerian people's destiny," to "create a real Algerian drama that reflects the feelings and desires of the Algerian people," to "strive to create scripts that reflect the Algerian people's armed struggle and revolutionary reality," and to perform for the people and for the soldiers of the Liberation Army, are undoubtedly correct. The Algerian artists humbly claim that their art troupe is very young, but they have already achieved very gratifying achievements, and they will certainly achieve greater achievements.
    The Algerian Art Troupe's introduction to folk art and the development of national art are also extremely gratifying. Protecting national culture and art, and developing national culture and art are an integral part of the entire national liberation cause. Imperialists either slander that the African people have no national culture and art, trying to use this to打击打击 the African people's fighting confidence; or they distort the African people's national culture and art to serve the delay of the demise of capitalism. Therefore, protecting national culture and art, and promoting national culture and art is itself a kind of battle. Please see, the Algerian people have such excellent culture and art! A nation with such excellent culture and art should not be oppressed by imperialism forever! People with such beautiful art cannot have only one night a week called "Arabian Night." All the nights and all the days in Algeria should belong to the Algerian people!
    Finally, I would like to end my article by quoting a few lines from the play "Towards the Light": "The bell of liberation has already sounded on the African continent. Due to the strong will of the Algerian people and the strong support of friendly countries all over the world, today's bell is louder than yesterday!"
    The fighting Algerian people will surely win!
    The fighting friendship between the Chinese people and the Algerian people will last forever!

    阿尔及利亚人民的英雄诗篇
    ——阿尔及利亚艺术团演出观后
    卢肃
    阿尔及利亚在我们中国人民的心目中是一个光辉的名字：它是一个英勇的民族，是我们反对帝国主义斗争中的战斗弟兄。我虽然没有到过阿尔及利亚，但是反对帝国主义的共同斗争早已把我们的心和阿尔及利亚人民的心联系在一起了。最近阿巴斯总理又访问了我们的国家，我国政府与阿尔及利亚政府又发表了共同声明，我国人民与阿尔及利亚人民的战斗友谊日益发展巩固了，我们的联系加强了。但是随着我们对阿尔及利亚人民更进一步的加强联系，我们就更感到应当对阿尔及利亚人民有进一步的了解，我们总想更多知道一些阿尔及利亚人民的生活，总想更多了解一些阿尔及利亚人民英勇斗争的情况，以及阿尔及利亚的文化艺术等等。我们正是怀着这样的心情迎接了阿尔及利亚人民的文化使者阿尔及利亚艺术团的贵宾们。
    我对阿尔及利亚的文化艺术知道得很少，但是每当我想起阿尔及利亚时就不免想到听闻中的“阿拉伯之夜”。同志们，什么叫阿尔及利亚的“阿拉伯之夜”呢？大家都知道阿尔及利亚的地理位置是在非洲，这正像法国是在欧洲一样地明白的事情。阿尔及利亚人民应当是阿尔及利亚的主人，这也是像法兰西是法兰西人的法兰西一样地清楚。但是，由于法帝国主义侵略了阿尔及利亚，因此，在阿尔及利亚的京城阿尔及尔，剧院里影院中一星期有六天是上演法国或欧洲的节目，只有一天准许演阿尔及利亚的节目，这一天被叫做“阿拉伯之夜！”据说在“阿拉伯之夜”，法帝国主义的警察密探还特别忙，他们在剧院里影院门旁的暗处盯梢，偷偷地记下去参加“阿拉伯之夜”的人们。就是这么回事！阿尔及利亚人民受到美式装备的法帝国主义的压迫侵略，阿尔及利亚人民的文化当然也受到帝国主义的压迫与侵略。阿尔及利亚人民要起来反抗帝国主义的侵略，阿尔及利亚的文化艺术当然也就成了人民的斗争武器。应当说我自从知道关于“阿拉伯之夜”的故事以后，就更强烈地喜爱阿尔及利亚人民的文化艺术了。我想，被帝国主义这样憎恨的艺术，被人民这样喜爱的艺术，一定是好的艺术。
    我就是怀着这样的心情，观看了阿尔及利亚艺术团在北京的演出。
    阿尔及利亚艺术团的演出，对于热望了解阿尔及利亚人民斗争生活的人是一次最大的满足。这次演出是阿尔及利亚人民斗争生活和阿尔及利亚民间音乐舞蹈的一个缩影。
    整个晚会分做两部分：第一部分是一个独幕歌舞剧《向光明》，这个歌舞剧包含着丰富的阿尔及利亚各地区的民间歌曲、民族舞蹈。晚会的第二部分是一个三幕话剧《不朽的人》，主要是描写阿尔及利亚民族解放军的英勇斗争。他们的演出是用阿拉伯语；我们不懂得阿拉伯语言，但是阿尔及利亚的艺术家们真实、深刻的表演打破了语言的隔阂，给了我们极其深刻的印象。
    歌舞剧《向光明》是一部热情的、美丽的爱国主义的诗篇。作者刻划了一个英勇不屈的阿尔及利亚青年，他为阿尔及利亚的民族解放斗争不幸被捕了，法帝国主义的伞兵拷打他，想叫这个战斗的阿尔及利亚青年向刽子手屈服；哪怕他发出一点痛苦的呼声也好。但是“严刑拷打在这种人身上是不起作用的”，这个阿尔及利亚青年没有呼痛更没有求饶，他蔑视敌人的威吓，他骄傲地想起了他为之流血战斗的祖国。场景在不断地变幻着，随着阿拉伯竖笛的声调，随着急密的鼓声，引出了许多优美的、强烈的以及抒情的民间歌曲民间舞蹈。乐师的白色长袍在这个阿尔及利亚青年的想像中，时隐时现。他想起了自己的成长，想起他姐姐曾跳过的古典的舞蹈，想起没有帝国主义压迫的日子是多么美好；人们可以按照民族的风俗举行婚礼的仪式，贺喜的人一直唱到深夜；人们跳舞来庆祝丰收。战斗的阿尔及利亚人并不在意自己肉体所受的痛苦，这个青年的心，乘着音乐的翅膀在阿尔及利亚的土地上飞翔。撒哈拉对于他来说并不是荒凉的沙漠，他想到人民的劳动会使沙漠变成绿洲，他还想起欢乐的《迎春舞》，他想：我们不应当只有痛苦，我们也应当有欢乐，但是欢乐是不能由别人赐予的，欢乐是要用战斗去争取的，首先就是要赶走一切侵略者！变幻的画幕使我们和剧中的主人公一起看到了雄壮的卡比利亚的高山，这些山区不但有令人神往的歌曲和舞蹈，这些山区更有着打击敌人的出色的战斗。随着奥雷斯山区的民歌声，我们看到了崖壁陡峭的奥雷斯山峦，奥雷斯的民歌是阿尔及利亚的民族骄傲，奥雷斯山峦是阿尔及利亚人天然的战斗堡垒，那里的人民战斗得最英勇……
    阿尔及利亚的人民是喜爱歌舞又能歌善舞的。你看，在这个歌舞剧中接连出现了多少动听迷人的歌舞啊。无怪人们常说非洲的人民常常是唱歌舞蹈一直到深夜。但是在整个歌舞剧快要结束时一切歌舞都停止了，情节发生了急剧的变化，被折磨的青年成了持枪战斗的士兵，诗人（作者）向我们严肃地宣告：今天，人们不再跳舞了，我们的孩子们正在尽力斗争！歌舞剧是在战斗的行进曲中结束的。对！走向光明！只有起来战斗，坚持战斗，才能冲破黑暗走向光明！
    一个独幕的歌舞剧给我的印象却是这样地丰富、深刻。
    对于阿尔及利亚艺术家们的歌唱、演奏和舞蹈表演，我只有一个字的赞语：好！而且我觉得有很多地方值得我们学习。
    晚会的第二部分是一个多幕话剧《不朽的人》。在这部作品中，作者集中地描写了民族解放军的英雄卡杜尔。卡杜尔是一个典型的阿尔及利亚人，他向敌人不息地战斗，他勇敢地面对着敌人的打击，把亲人和群众的牺牲痛苦化为杀敌的决心和力量。“我们的革命就是这样从一个伏击到另一个伏击，从一次战斗到另一次战斗；一个人牺牲，另一个又接上来，直到最后胜利……”卡杜尔就是这样地在战斗着。卡杜尔英勇牺牲以后，在他牺牲的地方有更多的人投入了战斗。剧中对民族解放军与人民群众的亲密关系，对群众的全民一致的战斗作了非常生动的描写。看这个戏的时候，我们清楚地感觉到阿尔及利亚人民的革命斗争不但是勇敢坚决的，而且是充满力量、充满胜利信心的。阿尔及利亚的革命必定胜利。
    这是一部内容十分丰富的戏剧。我觉得《不朽的人》不论写作不论表演都很忠实地反映了阿尔及利亚人民的当前斗争，这便是它的最大的成功之处。作为一个观众，我深信舞台上所发生的事情，而且我深信艺术家本人也是民族解放的忠诚战士。看了《不朽的人》使我感到很亲切；游击队的生活，林中空地上的练兵活动，一次战斗之后的热烈议论，人民军队在群众帮助下如鱼得水的情景，以及梳着两条辫子、卷起军衣袖子的女战士形象，样样都说明我们有过共同的经历，共同的斗争。中国人民与阿尔及利亚人民的战斗友谊是天然存在的，这种友谊是极为强烈、极为深刻的；阿尔及利亚的艺术家们又用自己的崇高劳动一再加强了这种兄弟的友谊。
    通过艺术团的整个演出，阿尔及利亚人民的优秀艺术给中国观众留下了极好的印象。我感到阿尔及利亚艺术团所走的道路是正确的：他们“要创造阿尔及利亚人民命运的形象”，要“创造一种反映阿尔及利亚人民的感情和愿望的真正的阿尔及利亚的戏剧”的努力，要“努力创作反映阿尔及利亚人民武装斗争和革命现实的剧本”以及经常为人民群众、为解放军战士演出，这些都无疑地是正确的。阿尔及利亚的艺术家们谦虚地自称他们的艺术团很年轻，但是他们已经获得了极可喜的成就，他们一定还会获得更大的成就。
    阿尔及利亚艺术团对于民间艺术的介绍，对民族艺术的发展也是极令人欣喜的。保卫民族文化艺术，发展民族文化艺术是整个民族解放事业的一个组成部分，帝国主义者要么诬蔑非洲人民没有民族文化艺术，想以此来打击非洲人民的战斗信心；要么就把非洲人民的民族文化艺术加以歪曲来为延缓资本主义的复灭服务，因此，保卫民族的文化艺术，发扬民族的文化艺术这本身也就是一种战斗。请看，阿尔及利亚人民有着多么优良的文化艺术！有着如此优良的文化艺术的民族是不应当永远受帝国主义的欺压的！有这样美好的艺术的人民不能在一个星期中只有一个夜晚叫“阿拉伯之夜”，阿尔及利亚的所有的夜晚和所有的白天都应当是属于阿尔及利亚人民的！
    最后我愿引用《向光明》一剧中的几句诗来结束我的文章：“非洲大陆已经响起了解放的钟声，由于阿尔及利亚人民表现了坚强意志和全世界友好国家的大力支援，今天的钟声比昨天更嘹亮！”
    战斗的阿尔及利亚人民一定胜利！
    中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民的战斗友谊万古长青！
