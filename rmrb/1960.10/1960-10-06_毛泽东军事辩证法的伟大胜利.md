The fourth volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" consists of Comrade Mao Zedong's major works during the Third Domestic Revolutionary War. These works are the pointer for achieving the great victory of the Third Domestic Revolutionary War and the battle horn inspiring the Chinese people to advance from victory to victory.

The publication of the fourth volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" will further strengthen the Marxist-Leninist ideological armament of the people of the whole country, so that we will not lose our way in the complicated revolutionary struggle and can withstand the tests in the face of serious political risks. Like Comrade Mao Zedong's other works, this volume summarizes rich experiences in revolutionary struggle. It is an outstanding example of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and a major development of Marxism-Leninism. It is not only a magic weapon for defeating imperialism and all reactionaries, but also the sharpest weapon for defending Marxism-Leninism and opposing modern revisionism.

Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time and a master of materialist dialectics. His works are a treasure house of dialectics. Comrade Mao Zedong not only creatively applied dialectics to solve a series of major issues in our country's revolution and construction, as well as a series of major issues concerning revolutionary warfare, but also, with his genius and originality, enriched and developed dialectics and established a systematic and complete Marxist-Leninist military dialectics system. The victory of the Chinese revolutionary war is a great victory of Comrade Mao Zedong's correct political and military lines, and also a great victory of Mao Zedong's military dialectics. Comrade Mao Zedong's military dialectics is a monument in Marxist-Leninist military science and a vast ocean. This article can only select a few important issues—war and peace; strategically despising the enemy and tactically valuing the enemy; the purpose of war is to preserve oneself and eliminate the enemy; the relationship between the overall situation and the part in war guidance; the human factor and the material factor in war, etc.—to talk about some of my experiences in studying Mao Zedong's military dialectics.

	On the Question of War and Peace

What is war? Comrade Mao Zedong said: "War—a highest form of struggle to resolve contradictions between classes and classes, nations and nations, countries and countries, political groups and political groups at a certain stage of development, which has begun since the emergence of private property and classes." ① And he pointed out: "Politics is war without bloodshed, while war is politics with bloodshed." ② The contradictory parties constitute a unity, and the bloody struggle and the non-bloody struggle constitute the politics of class society. Only by basing oneself on politics and using the method of class analysis to understand war can one correctly understand war; leaving politics, one cannot understand the essence of war.

War and peace are both political phenomena of class society and forms of class struggle. Imperialists and reactionaries have always relied on two tactics in dealing with the people: one is war, that is, the method of violence, and the other is "peace," that is, the method of deception and appeasement. The two tactics are either used simultaneously or alternately. We should also rely on two tactics in dealing with the enemy: one is to expose the enemy's "peace" deception and strive for a genuine peace that is beneficial to the people, and the other is to oppose counter-revolutionary war with revolutionary war, that is, to deal with the counter-revolutionary two tactics with the revolutionary two tactics. Comrade Mao Zedong precisely solved the problem of war and peace dialectically in this way. As far as the Third Domestic Revolutionary War is concerned, as early as before Japan's surrender, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the Kuomintang's traitorous and dictatorial reactionary policy, foresaw the danger of civil war and called on the people to be vigilant and stop the civil war. After Japan's surrender, the Kuomintang, with the direct support of U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, played peace conspiracies, and on the other hand, prepared for a full-scale civil war. The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong led the people of the whole country to unswervingly strive for peace and oppose civil war. For this purpose, Comrade Mao Zedong personally went to Chongqing to conduct peace negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek, made great efforts, and reached the "Double Tenth Agreement." On the other hand, he taught us never to rely on negotiations, never to hope that the Kuomintang would show kindness, but to resolutely rely on the people and be prepared to oppose counter-revolutionary war with revolutionary war at any time. It is precisely because we have two tactics instead of only one that we have not only thwarted the enemy's peace conspiracies, but also crushed the enemy's military offensive. The revolutionary two tactics and the counter-revolutionary two tactics are diametrically opposed. This is the objective law of class confrontation. Complying with this law can guide the revolution to victory, and violating this law will cause the revolution to suffer failure. There has never been a war without political nature in history, nor is there any peace that transcends classes. Anyone who departs from politics and isolates and absolutizes war and peace cannot fundamentally understand the problem of war and peace.

There are two kinds of wars in history, just wars and unjust wars. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "All progressive wars are just, and all wars that impede progress are unjust. We Communists oppose all unjust wars that impede progress, but we do not oppose progressive, just wars. For the latter kind of war, we Communists not only do not oppose it, but also actively participate in it." ③ Obviously, it is wrong to generally raise the question of opposing or not opposing war, approving or not approving war. All just wars are not some kind of "crime" at all. On the contrary, they are great good deeds to stop unjust wars, thereby educating the people, mobilizing the people, overthrowing the reactionary rule, and liberating the people. Marxists believe that just revolutionary wars are antitoxins, midwives of new societies, and bridges to new worlds. The unjust counter-revolutionary wars always try their best to hinder the development of social history, cruelly massacre the people, and bring great disasters to the people. Therefore, we advocate opposing unjust wars with just wars, and opposing counter-revolutionary wars with revolutionary wars. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We are supporters of the elimination of war, we do not want war; but war can only be eliminated through war, and gun barrels must be picked up if gun barrels are not wanted." ④ The rich experience of the Chinese revolution fully proves this truth.

There are two kinds of wars, and there are also two kinds of peace. One is false peace, which is the "peace" that imperialism and reactionaries use to enslave, exploit, and plunder the proletariat and the working people, and to stifle the people's resistance to cruel rule, allowing them to be at their disposal. It is the "peace" to cover up their war policies and aggressive policies, and the "peace" to gain a breather in order to continue unjust wars. The "peace" played by Chiang Kai-shek under the support of the United States during the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, and the "peace" in the mouth of U.S. imperialism, are such false peace. One is genuine peace, which is the peace for the proletariat and the working people to build socialism and communism after they have been freed from enslavement and oppression, the peace that realizes the lofty ideal of the complete liberation of mankind, and the peace that is beneficial to the people because the counter-revolutionary war plan has been stopped or postponed. What our party strived for during the Third Domestic Revolutionary War and what socialist countries and the people of the world are striving for now is such genuine peace. If this issue is not analyzed and treated in a general way, it is also wrong. As a result, one will lose one's way and even fall into the trap of imperialism and reactionaries. We have always adhered to genuine peace and thoroughly exposed false peace. Peace cannot be begged for, but must be achieved by relying on resolute struggle, strengthening the revolutionary forces of the people, and exposing the enemy's conspiracies. Begging imperialism and reactionaries for peace will inevitably increase the enemy's ferocity, paralyze the people's fighting spirit, and will not be able to avoid war or achieve peace.

War and peace are mutually opposed, and under certain conditions, they can also be transformed into each other. War can be transformed into peace, and peace can be transformed into war. For example, the first Kuomintang-Communist cooperation was transformed into the Second Domestic Revolutionary War in 1927 due to the betrayal of the bourgeoisie and the intensification of class contradictions. Later, due to the Japanese invasion of China, the national contradiction exceeded the class contradiction, and the civil war was transformed into domestic peace, resulting in the second Kuomintang-Communist cooperation to carry out the war of resistance against Japan. The war of resistance against Japan ended with Japan's complete defeat, and was transformed into post-war peace. Soon, Chiang Kai-shek launched a counter-revolutionary civil war, and peace was transformed into the Third Domestic Revolutionary War. The Chinese people defeated Chiang Kai-shek, and domestic peace appeared again. The reason why war and peace can be transformed into each other is that they have identity under certain conditions. War is a continuation of peacetime policy, and peace is a continuation of wartime policy. The reason why peace is transformed into war is that class contradictions are intensified and developed to the point where it is impossible not to adopt external confrontation. War is transformed into peace because one side has defeated the other, or although the victory or defeat is undecided, the contradictory position that caused the war has changed. In the struggle against imperialism and its lackeys, the decisive conditions for transforming the situation in a direction favorable to the people are the strength of the people and the struggle of the people.

In class society, war is inevitable. As for specific wars, when to fight, where to fight, who fights with whom, whether to fight a big war or a small war, are all somewhat accidental. Necessity is expressed through accident. Since the end of World War II, has local war ever stopped on this planet for even one day in the past fifteen years? Speaking of world wars, in the current situation, because the East wind prevails over the West wind, and because of the people's active struggle, it is possible to postpone or prevent them. This is one possibility. But because the aggressive nature of imperialism has not and cannot be changed, a major war is not absolutely impossible. This is another possibility. It is one-sided and wrong to think that there is only the former possibility and not the latter, that there is only one possibility and not two. War is a historical phenomenon of class society. "Water has its source, and trees have their roots." As long as classes exist, there will be armies, there will be weapons, and there will be wars. The Moscow Declaration pointed out: "As long as imperialism exists, there will be soil for aggressive wars." In class society, although war can be temporarily transformed into peace, such peace cannot be permanent. To think that war can be permanently avoided before mankind eliminates classes is merely a naive fantasy. From the history of the development of human society, the occurrence, development, and elimination of war are consistent with the occurrence, development, and elimination of classes. Classes go from nothing to something, and then from something to elimination on a new basis; human war also follows classes from nothing to something, and then from something to elimination on a new basis. That is the era when capitalism is eliminated all over the world and socialism and communism achieve complete victory. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Human society will progress to the elimination of classes and the elimination of the state. At that time, there will be no more wars, no more counter-revolutionary wars, no more revolutionary wars, no more unjust wars, and no more just wars. This is the era of permanent peace for mankind. Our study of the laws of revolutionary war proceeds from our desire to eliminate all wars. This is the boundary line between us Communists and all exploiting classes." ⑤

	On Strategically Despising the Enemy and Tactically
				Valuing the Enemy

When we face a ferocious enemy, especially when we are about to engage in a life-and-death military struggle with him, how should we understand and treat the enemy? In August 1946, precisely when the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, supported by U.S. imperialism, launched a large-scale offensive against the people's liberated areas, and was arrogant and invincible, Comrade Mao Zedong made the famous statement: "All reactionaries are paper tigers." "Chiang Kai-shek and his supporter, the U.S. reactionaries, are also paper tigers." ⑥ Later, Comrade Mao Zedong extended this statement and said: "In order to fight against the enemy, we have formed a concept over a long period of time, that is, strategically we must despise all enemies, and tactically we must value all enemies." ⑦ These brilliant ideas of Comrade Mao Zedong correctly solved the problem of understanding and treating the enemy, and guided the Chinese revolutionary war to victory.

Imperialism and all reactionaries have a dual nature. On the one hand, in essence, in the long run, and strategically, they are paper tigers; on the other hand, they are also real tigers. Paper tigers and real tigers coexist in a unity. Isn't this the case with Chiang Kai-shek and his supporter, the U.S. reactionaries, during the Third Domestic Revolutionary War? 4.3 million troops, with great momentum; occupying areas with a population of more than 300 million, controlling all major cities and most of the railway lines in the country; U.S. military training, U.S. weapons and equipment, plus all the equipment received from the surrender of one million Japanese invading troops in China; U.S. imperialists, holding atomic bombs, used airplanes and warships to transport troops and deploy forces for Chiang Kai-shek, and also sent 90,000 marines to occupy important cities such as Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, and Qinhuangdao, and built and protected roads for the Kuomintang army in North China, clearing the way. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique believed that the People's Liberation Army was vulnerable, and brazenly tore up the "Truce Agreement" and the "Political Consultative Conference Resolution," launching a full-scale civil war. Then, they attacked the Central Plains, occupied Huaiyin, seized Andong, took Chengde, forcibly occupied Zhangjiakou, and boasted: "Defeat the CCP army within five months," "Military solution can be completed in three months, at most five months"; wherever the Kuomintang army went, they killed, set fires, and committed all kinds of evil. Is this not a man-eating real tiger? However, this is only one side of it. There is also another side, the side of the paper tiger. It is traitorous and dictatorial, divorced from the people, full of contradictions, and divided; its foundation is weak, and there are insurmountable economic and political crises. Under its reactionary rule, people are living in misery, and the people are full of resentment, and popular uprisings are frequent. Its troops are scattered, the rear is empty, the command is incompetent, the morale is low, and it is getting weaker and smaller in the war, until it is deserted by its followers and collapses. Is this not a paper tiger that looks strong but is actually weak? According to the laws of social development, through the practice of revolutionary struggle, we realize that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers; because they are reactionary, decadent, dying, and can be defeated, we have reason to despise them strategically. However, when it still has power for the time being, is still very ferocious, and still wants to eat people, in this sense, it is a real tiger, and we must value it tactically. Regarding the enemy, we must understand it from its essence. It is precisely because of this that even when the enemy is still very powerful, we dare to struggle, dare to make revolution, dare to win, and have the revolutionary spirit and heroism to overwhelm everything; otherwise, we will commit opportunist errors. Even if the enemy is already crumbling and dying, we must still be conscientious, maintain a high degree of vigilance and a heroic and tenacious fighting style, and have the determination to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely wipe out the enemy; otherwise, we will paralyze ourselves and give the enemy a chance to take advantage of. To despise the enemy strategically and value it tactically is the correct reflection of subjective thought on objective things, and it is also the unity of knowledge and practice. Bian Zhuangzi, who assassinated the tiger, and Wu Song, who fought the tiger, had a better understanding of tigers; because they had stabbed and fought them, and had gone through the practice of struggle. The revolutionary people who have engaged in long-term and complex struggles with imperialism and reactionaries have profoundly understood this truth from their own practice. The unity of opposites between paper tigers and real tigers is the most insightful analysis and the most vivid portrayal of imperialism and all reactionaries.

The transformation from a real tiger to a paper tiger is a transformation process, and it is also the process from reaction to death for imperialism and all reactionaries. Its transformation is first determined by its essence and its internal factors. When the enemy launched a full-scale offensive against the liberated areas with murderous intent and great momentum, Comrade Mao Zedong asserted that "Chiang's army will surely be defeated." When Chiang Kai-shek took Zhangjiakou and was blinded by victory, and convened a pseudo-National Assembly alone, our Party Central Committee pointed out: "The day this meeting opens is the time when the Chiang Kai-shek clique begins to bring about its own destruction." ⑧ This is the inevitable trend of war and revolutionary development, and no one can stop it. However, Chiang's army will inevitably be defeated does not mean that Chiang's army will be defeated by itself; the Chiang Kai-shek clique will bring about its own destruction does not mean that the Chiang Kai-shek clique will destroy itself. The enemy will not fall if they are not attacked, and no reactionary force will automatically withdraw from the stage of history. The fact that objective things have the possibility of transformation does not mean that they have become a reality. The transformation of possibility into reality is a development process full of struggle. In this process, the most important thing is to master and use objective laws, give full play to subjective initiative, and carry out resolute revolutionary struggles to promote the death of decadent things and the growth of new things. On this issue, we are thorough revolutionaries, and we have nothing in common with cowardly, crawling, vulgar evolutionism.

From the perspective of revolutionary development, new forces will surely defeat decadent forces. However, only struggle can lead to victory; without struggle, there can be no self-victory. Struggle is the work of transformation, is subjective effort, and is revolutionary practice. Defeating the enemy is by no means easy. Battles must be fought one by one, enemies must be eliminated part by part, fortresses must be captured one by one, and positions must be occupied piece by piece. There is no smooth and unobstructed road to defeating the enemy. We have finally achieved victory only after going through unparalleled heroic struggles, overcoming unimaginable difficulties, and traversing a long and tortuous road. We fought with enemies at home and abroad for more than twenty years, and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War alone lasted for more than three years, before we finally overthrew the three great mountains that were weighing on the Chinese people and stood up in the East of the world. Therefore, we have learned that to defeat the enemy, we must not only despise the enemy strategically, but also value the enemy tactically, and not fight unprepared battles or battles we are not sure of winning, and we must "use ten against one" and accumulate small victories into big victories. Otherwise, we will not be able to defeat the enemy.

The process of defeating the enemy is also a process from quantitative change to qualitative change, and from partial qualitative change to complete qualitative change. After the start of the Liberation War, after eight months of fighting and annihilating more than 710,000 enemies, the enemy's full-scale offensive was stopped. After one year of fighting and annihilating 1.12 million enemies, the disparity between the enemy's strength and our weakness at the beginning of the war was changed. As a result, our army turned to strategic offensive, and the enemy was forced to turn to strategic defense. The Liaoshen Campaign ⑨ annihilated 472,000 enemies, the entire Northeast was liberated, and the national enemy-us situation underwent a fundamental change. Our army not only had an advantage in quality, but also turned into an advantage in quantity, which determined the accelerated victory of the Liberation War. After the Huaihai and Pingjin Campaigns ⑩, the enemy's elite troops were completely lost. At this point, we had achieved a basic military victory. When a million-strong army crossed the Yangtze River, our army entered the stage of strategic pursuit, and the blue sky and white sun flag on the pseudo-presidential palace in Nanjing suddenly fell, and the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty, which had ruled China for more than twenty years, was overthrown. From the accumulation of quantity to the leap of quality, this is the process of the new forces defeating the decadent forces, the process of the People's Liberation Army turning from strategic defense to strategic offensive, and the process of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique transforming from a partial real tiger to a complete paper tiger. The decisive link in the transformation is the armed struggle of the Chinese people.

Communists are doing the work of transformation. In the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, we have already reversed the wheel of counter-revolution and made it go to destruction; promoted the wheel of revolution and made it go to victory. We have transformed the dark old China into the bright new China. Now, we are continuing to struggle, constantly making revolution, and transforming the "poor and blank" China into a great socialist China that is prosperous, strong, civilized, and flourishing. This is the work of turning the world upside down and reversing the universe. Transforming the world is the lofty ideal and heroic undertaking of communists; struggle and more struggle is our revolutionary philosophy. However, when we are engaged in a life-and-death struggle with a ferocious enemy, we must follow this military dialectic of Comrade Mao Zedong: "Strategically, we must despise all enemies, and tactically, we must value all enemies."

	On the Question of Preserving Oneself and Eliminating the Enemy

Preserving oneself and eliminating the enemy is the basic principle of war, the essence of war, and the basis of all war actions. It runs through the entire process of war. The purpose of preserving oneself is to eliminate the enemy. If one only aims to preserve oneself, one will not only fail to achieve the goal of eliminating the enemy, but also fail to preserve oneself. If one does not preserve oneself, one will not be able to eliminate the enemy well, and may even be eliminated by the enemy. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "In the purpose of war, eliminating the enemy is the main one, and preserving oneself is the second one, because only by eliminating the enemy in large numbers can one effectively preserve oneself." ?

The two basic means of preserving oneself and eliminating the enemy are: offense and defense. Pursuit is only a continuation of offense; retreat is a continuation of defense. Marxists-Leninists believe that offense and pursuit are directly for the purpose of eliminating the enemy, and at the same time for the purpose of preserving oneself. Defense and retreat are directly for the purpose of preserving oneself, and at the same time for the purpose of assisting the offense or preparing to turn to the offense, thereby eliminating the enemy. Judging from the practical experience of revolutionary war, there are two completely opposed viewpoints on the issue of offense and defense: one is the dialectical viewpoint represented by Mao Zedong's military thought, and the other is the metaphysical viewpoint. The dialectical viewpoint holds that offense and defense are mutually dependent and mutually penetrating. There is defense in offense and offense in defense; offense can be turned into defense, and defense can also be turned into offense. In the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, Comrade Mao Zedong started from this viewpoint. Based on the comparison of enemy and us forces, in the war guidance, he admitted positive defense and opposed passive defense; implemented "the enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue." ? "Inducing the enemy to go deep" and "concentrating superior forces, selecting the enemy's weaknesses, and annihilating a part or most of the enemy reliably in mobile warfare to defeat the enemy one by one" ? and other strategic and tactical principles. As a result, the enemy was annihilated and we developed ourselves. At that time, those who held metaphysical viewpoints could not see the dialectical relationship between offense and defense, did not correctly estimate the enemy and us forces. In military guidance, they advocated "full-line attack" and "defending the enemy outside the country," and competed with the powerful enemy in attrition. In the process of the war, they manifested adventurism in offense, conservatism in defense, and escapeism in retreat. As a result, they could neither preserve themselves well nor effectively eliminate the enemy, but caused the revolutionary war to suffer major setbacks.

In revolutionary war, in order to preserve oneself and eliminate the enemy, one must be good at mastering the dialectical law of offense and defense, and flexibly and mobilely use the two means of offense and defense. In strategic defense, we must adopt offensive in campaigns and battles; without offensive in campaigns and battles, it is impossible to turn strategic defense into strategic offense. After turning to strategic offense, there cannot be no defense in campaigns and battles; if this aspect is ignored, losses may be suffered locally, and may even affect the overall situation. Offense and defense move and transform each other. In revolutionary war, we must be good at offense, strive for offense, and try our best to turn defense into offense, so that we can preserve ourselves and eliminate the enemy. The question is, when a powerful enemy is implementing strategic offensive against us, and we are in a strategic defensive position and forced to carry out protracted internal warfare, how should we implement offense against the enemy? Comrade Mao Zedong once put forward the correct operational policy for campaigns and battles, which is to implement "offensive warfare of quick decisions on the external lines." That is to say, in campaigns and battles, we must concentrate absolutely superior forces in each battle, and attack one of the enemy's lines from the external lines of the battlefield, and launch a surprise attack against the enemy in motion with the tactics of attacking them unprepared, and implement quick decisions. By annihilating the enemy part by part in this way, we can make them change from strong to weak, and constantly develop ourselves, and make us change from weak to strong; the comparison of enemy and us forces also changes constantly with the continuous rise and fall: from the enemy's superiority and our inferiority to the balance of enemy and us forces, and then from the balance of enemy and us forces to our superiority and the enemy's inferiority, we can turn from strategic defense to strategic offensive, and achieve the ultimate goal of eliminating the enemy and preserving ourselves. This is the dialectical relationship between preserving oneself and eliminating the enemy, and between the change of offense and defense strategically and tactically. The historical facts of previous revolutionary wars have repeatedly proved that Comrade Mao Zedong's guiding principle is always victorious.

Resolutely fighting annihilation battles is the most effective tactic for preserving oneself and eliminating the enemy. The ten major military principles formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong in the Third Domestic Revolutionary War? concentratedly and prominently expressed Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of annihilation battles.

The primary issue in fighting annihilation battles is to concentrate forces. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Concentrate absolutely superior forces in each battle (two, three, four times, and sometimes even five or six times the enemy's forces), surround the enemy on all sides, and strive to annihilate them completely without letting any escape." ? This is the operational principle of "using one against ten" strategically and "using ten against one" tactically. In the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, we annihilated the enemy in large numbers precisely by following this principle. Historical facts show that in the offensive battles of campaigns and battles, only by concentrating superior forces can we effectively annihilate the enemy one by one. Comrade Mao Zedong also taught us: "Take the annihilation of the enemy's living forces as the main goal, and not taking the preservation and seizure of territory as the main goal." "However, places that can be preserved or seized in terms of the comparison of enemy and us forces and places that are of strategic and tactical significance must be preserved or seized, otherwise it is a mistake." ? In the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, we implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's correct instructions. In the first four months after the start of the war, our army voluntarily abandoned 105 cities and some areas, but in exchange for the victory of annihilating more than 300,000 enemies; in the second four months, our army abandoned 87 cities, and at the same time recovered and liberated 87 cities, with roughly equal gains and losses, but I annihilated more than 410,000 enemies; by the third four months, our army gained 58 more cities compared to the losses, and at the same time annihilated more than 400,000 enemies. In the entire Liberation War, from annihilating hundreds of thousands of enemies to annihilating eight million enemies; from abandoning cities and land, to preserving and seizing cities and land, and finally liberating the entire mainland; these great historical facts vividly show the dialectical relationship between the annihilation of the enemy and the gains and losses of cities and land under the conditions at that time, and fully prove that Comrade Mao Zedong's guiding principle is completely in line with objective laws.

In the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, as in previous revolutionary wars, in order to preserve oneself and eliminate the enemy, we adopted both defensive and offensive means; there was defense in offense and offense in defense; in strategic internal protracted defensive warfare, we adopted tactical external swift offensive warfare; "using one against ten" strategically and "using ten against one" in campaigns and tactics; abandoning or preserving or seizing some cities and land, annihilating the enemy's living forces, and gaining more cities and land. It is in this contradictory movement of unity of opposites, under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's military dialectics, that we first achieved the fundamental goal of war: to preserve ourselves and eliminate the enemy. Finally, we achieved the political goal of the war: to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and establish a new China.

    毛泽东军事辩证法的伟大胜利
    傅钟
    《毛泽东选集》第四卷，是毛泽东同志在第三次国内革命战争时期的主要著作。这些著作，是取得第三次国内革命战争伟大胜利的指针，是鼓舞中国人民不断从胜利走向胜利的战斗号角。
    《毛泽东选集》第四卷的出版，将进一步加强全国人民的马克思列宁主义的思想武装，使我们在复杂的革命斗争中，不致迷失方向；在严重的政治风险面前，能经得起考验。像毛泽东同志的其他著作一样，在这一卷中，毛泽东同志总结了丰富的革命斗争经验，这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合的杰出典范，是对马克思列宁主义的重大发展。它不仅是战胜帝国主义和一切反动派的法宝，而且是保卫马克思列宁主义、反对现代修正主义的最锋利的武器。
    毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是唯物辩证法的大师，他的著作就是辩证法的宝库。毛泽东同志不仅创造性地运用辩证法，解决了我国革命和建设的一系列的重大问题，解决了关于革命战争一系列的重大问题，而且以其天才的独创精神，丰富和发展了辩证法，建立了系统而完整的马克思列宁主义的军事辩证法体系。中国革命战争的胜利，是毛泽东同志正确的政治路线和军事路线的伟大胜利，也是毛泽东军事辩证法的伟大胜利。毛泽东同志的军事辩证法，是马克思列宁主义军事科学的丰碑，是浩瀚的海洋。本文只能选取其中几个重要问题——战争与和平；战略上藐视敌人和战术上重视敌人；战争的目的是保存自己消灭敌人；战争指导上全局和局部的关系；战争中人的因素和物的因素等，谈谈自己学习毛泽东军事辩证法的一些体会。
          关于战争与和平的问题
    战争是什么呢？毛泽东同志说：“战争——从有私有财产和有阶级以来就开始了的、用以解决阶级和阶级、民族和民族、国家和国家、政治集团和政治集团之间、在一定发展阶段上的矛盾的一种最高的斗争形式。”①并且指出：“政治是不流血的战争，战争是流血的政治。”②矛盾着的双方构成一个统一体，流血的斗争和不流血的斗争构成了阶级社会的政治。只有立足于政治，运用阶级分析的方法来认识战争，才能正确地了解战争；离开了政治，就不能认清战争的本质。
    战争与和平，都是阶级社会的政治现象，都是阶级斗争的形式。帝国主义和反动派对付人民历来依靠两手，一手是战争即暴力的方法，一手是“和平”即欺骗怀柔的方法；两手或者同时并举，或者交替运用。我们对付敌人，也应当依靠两手，一手是揭露敌人的“和平”欺骗，争取真正有利于人民的和平，一手是以革命战争反对反革命战争，即以革命的两手对付反革命的两手。毛泽东同志正是这样辩证地解决了战争与和平的问题。就第三次国内革命战争来说，早在日本投降以前，毛泽东同志就根据国民党卖国独裁的反动政策，预见到内战的危险，号召国人提高警惕，制止内战。日本投降以后，国民党在美帝国主义的直接支持下，一方面玩弄和平阴谋，一方面准备全面内战。党和毛泽东同志领导全国人民一面坚持不懈地争取和平，反对内战，为了这个目的，毛泽东同志还亲自去重庆同蒋介石进行和平谈判，作了重大的努力，达成了“双十协定”；一面又教导我们绝对不要依靠谈判，绝对不要希望国民党发善心，而要坚决依靠人民，随时准备用革命战争反对反革命战争。正由于我们有两手而不是只有一手，所以我们既挫败了敌人的和平阴谋，又粉碎了敌人的军事进攻。革命的两手与反革命两手，针锋相对，这是阶级对抗的客观规律。符合这个规律就能指导革命走向胜利，违背这个规律就将使革命遭受失败。历史上从来没有不带政治性的战争，也不存在超阶级的和平。谁要是脱离政治，把战争与和平孤立起来，绝对化起来，就不能从本质上认识战争与和平的问题。
    历史上有两种性质的战争，正义的战争和非正义的战争。毛泽东同志说：“一切进步的战争都是正义的，一切阻碍进步的战争都是非正义的。我们共产党人反对一切阻碍进步的非正义的战争，但是不反对进步的正义的战争。对于后一类战争，我们共产党人不但不反对，而且积极地参加。”③显然，如果笼统地提反对不反对战争、赞成不赞成战争，是错误的。一切正义战争，不但不是什么“罪恶”，相反地，倒是制止非正义战争，从而教育人民，动员人民，推翻反动统治，解放人民的大好事。马克思主义者认为，正义的革命战争是抗毒素，是新社会的产婆，是通向新世界的桥梁。而非正义的反革命战争总是极力阻碍社会历史的发展，残酷地屠杀人民，给人民带来巨大的灾难。所以我们主张用正义战争反对非正义战争，用革命战争反对反革命战争。毛泽东同志说：“我们是战争消灭论者，我们是不要战争的；但是只能经过战争去消灭战争，不要枪杆子必须拿起枪杆子。”④中国革命的丰富经验，充分地证明了这个真理。
    有两种性质的战争，也有两种性质的和平。一种是假和平，这是帝国主义和反动派为了奴役、剥削和掠夺无产阶级和劳动人民，并且窒息人民对于残酷统治的反抗而任其摆布的
  “和平”，是为了掩盖其战争政策和侵略政策的“和平”，是为了获得喘息，以便继续进行非正义战争的“和平”。美国支持下的蒋介石在第三次国内革命战争时期玩弄过的“和平”，美帝国主义口里的“和平”，便是这样的假和平。一种是真和平，这是无产阶级和劳动人民摆脱了奴役和压迫之后为了建设社会主义和共产主义的和平，是实现了人类彻底解放的崇高理想的和平，是由于制止或推迟了反革命战争计划而得到的有利于人民的和平。我党在第三次国内革命战争时期努力争取的和现在社会主义国家以及全世界人民努力争取的便是这样的真和平。如果在这个问题上不加分析，笼统对待，也是错误的。其结果就会迷失方向，以至会上了帝国主义和反动派的圈套。我们一贯坚持真和平，彻底揭露假和平。和平不能乞求，而必须依靠坚决的斗争，壮大人民的革命力量，戳穿敌人的阴谋，才能取得。向帝国主义和反动派乞求和平，必然助长敌人的凶焰，麻痹人民的斗志，并不能避免战争，取得和平。
    战争与和平是互相对立的，在一定条件下，又可以互相转化，战争转化为和平，和平转化为战争。例如第一次国共合作，由于资产阶级的叛变，阶级矛盾激化了，1927年转化为第二次国内革命战争；以后由于日本侵略中国，民族矛盾超过了阶级矛盾，内战转化为国内和平，出现了第二次国共合作进行抗日战争的局面；抗日战争以日本的彻底失败而告终，转化为战后和平；不久，蒋介石发动反革命内战，和平又转化为第三次国内革命战争；中国人民打垮了蒋介石，再次出现了国内和平。战争与和平之所以能够互相转化，是因为它们在一定条件下，具备着同一性。战争是平时政策的继续，和平是战时政策的继续。和平所以转化为战争，是因为阶级矛盾激化，发展到了非采取外部对抗形式不可的缘故。战争转化为和平，则是由于一方战胜了另一方，或者虽然胜负未分，但由于造成战争的矛盾地位起了变化。在同帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中，要使形势向着有利于人民的方面转化，决定的条件是人民的力量，人民的斗争。
    在阶级社会中，战争具有必然性，至于具体的战争，什么时候打，在哪里打，谁跟谁打，大打还是小打，却具有一定的偶然性。必然性是通过偶然性来表现的。第二次世界大战结束到现在，十五年来，局部战争在地球上哪一天断过？说到世界大战，在目前形势下，由于东风压倒西风，由于人民的积极斗争，是有可能推迟或者防止的，这是一种可能；但因为帝国主义的侵略本性没有、也不可能改变，大战不是绝对不可能发生，这是又一种可能。认为只有前一种可能，没有后一种可能，只有一种可能，没有两种可能，是片面的，错误的。战争是阶级社会的历史现象。“水有源，树有根”，只要阶级存在，就会有军队，就会有武器，就会有战争。《莫斯科宣言》指出：“只要帝国主义还存在，就有发生侵略战争的土壤。”在阶级社会里，战争虽然能够暂时转化为和平，但是这样的和平不可能是永久的。认为在人类消灭阶级以前就可以永远避免战争，这仅仅是一种天真的幻想。从人类社会发展的历史来看，战争的发生、发展和消灭，是同阶级的发生、发展和消灭相一致的。阶级是从无到有，再从有到在新的基础上的消灭；人类的战争也是随着阶级从无到有，再从有到在新的基础上的消灭。那便是在全世界消灭了资本主义，社会主义和共产主义获得完全胜利的时代。毛泽东同志说：“人类社会进步到消灭了阶级，消灭了国家，到了那时，什么战争也没有了，反革命战争没有了，革命战争也没有了，非正义战争没有了，正义战争也没有了，这就是人类的永久和平的时代。我们研究革命战争的规律，出发于我们要求消灭一切战争的志愿，这是区别我们共产党人和一切剥削阶级的界线。”⑤
      关于战略上藐视敌人和战术上
                重视敌人的问题
    当我们面对着凶恶的敌人，特别是要和他进行你死我活的军事斗争的时候，我们应该怎样认识敌人和对待敌人呢？1946年8月，正是蒋介石反动集团在美帝国主义支持下大举进攻人民解放区，趾高气扬、不可一世的时候，毛泽东同志发表了著名的论断：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。”“蒋介石和他的支持者美国反动派也都是纸老虎。”⑥以后，毛泽东同志又引伸了这个论断说：“为了同敌人作斗争，我们在一个长时间内形成了一个概念，就是说，在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人。”⑦毛泽东同志的这些光辉的思想，正确地解决了认识敌人和对待敌人的问题，引导中国革命战争走向胜利。
    帝国主义和一切反动派都具有两重性。一方面，从本质上看，从长期上看，从战略上看，它们是纸老虎；另一方面，它们又是真老虎。纸老虎和真老虎共存于一个统一体中。第三次国内革命战争时期的蒋介石及其支持者美国反动派，不正是如此吗？四百三十万军队，声势汹汹；占据着三亿以上人口的地区，控制着全国所有大城市及绝大部分的铁路交通线；美国的军事训练，美国的武器装备，还加上接收日本侵华军队一百万人投降的全部装备；手里拿着原子弹的美帝国主义者用飞机和军舰为蒋介石运输军队、部署兵力，还派海军陆战队九万人占驻上海、青岛、天津、北平、秦皇岛等重要城市，并在华北地区为国民党军队筑路、护路，鸣锣开道。蒋介石反动集团认为人民解放军不堪一击，悍然撕毁“停战协定”和“政协决议”，发动全面内战，于是打中原，占淮阴，抢安东，拿承德，强占张家口，大吹大擂，宣称：“五个月之内打垮中共军”，“三个月，至多五个月可以完成以军事解决问题”；国民党军队所到之处，杀人放火，无恶不作；如此等等。难道这还不是吃人的真老虎吗？然而，这只是它的一面，还有另一面，纸老虎的一面。它卖国独裁，脱离人民，矛盾重重，四分五裂；它基础虚弱，存在着不可克服的经济危机和政治危机，在它的反动统治之下，民不聊生，民怨沸腾，民变蜂起；它兵力分散，后方空虚，指挥无能，士气不振，愈战愈弱，愈战愈小，终而至于众叛亲离，土崩瓦解。难道这还不是外强中干的纸老虎吗？根据社会发展的规律，通过革命斗争的实践，我们认识到：帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎；因为它是反动的，腐朽的，走向死亡的，可以战胜的，所以我们有理由在战略上藐视它。但是，当它暂时还有力量，还很凶恶，还要吃人的时候，就这一点来说，它又是真老虎，我们又必须在战术上重视它。对于敌人，我们一定要从本质上来认识它。正是因为如此，所以即使敌人还很强大的时候，我们也敢于斗争，敢于革命，敢于胜利，具有压倒一切的革命精神和英雄气概；否则，就要犯机会主义错误。即使敌人已经摇摇欲坠、气息奄奄了，我们仍须兢兢业业，保持高度的警惕性和英勇顽强的战斗作风，要有坚决、彻底、干净、全部歼灭敌人的决心；否则，就会麻痹自己，给敌人以可乘之隙。对敌人，既在战略上藐视它，又在战术上重视它，这才是主观思想对客观事物的正确反映，这也是认识和实践的统一。刺虎的卞庄子和打虎的武松，对老虎是比较有认识的；因为他们刺过，打过，经过斗争的实践。同帝国主义和反动派进行过长期复杂斗争的革命人民，就是从自己的实践中深刻地认识了这一真理的。纸老虎和真老虎的对立统一，这是对帝国主义和一切反动派最入骨的分析和最生动的写照。
    由真老虎变成纸老虎，这是一个转化过程，也是帝国主义和一切反动派由反动到死亡的过程。它的转化首先是由它的本质、它的内在因素决定的。当敌人杀气腾腾，声势浩大，向解放区发动全面进攻的时候，毛泽东同志就曾经断言“蒋军必败”。当蒋介石打下张家口，胜利冲昏头脑，单独召开伪国民大会的时候，我们的党中央就指出：“此会开幕之日，即蒋介石集团开始自取灭亡之时。”⑧这是战争与革命发展的必然趋势，任何人也无法阻挡。但是，蒋军必败，却不等于蒋军自败；蒋介石集团自取灭亡，也不等于蒋介石集团自行灭亡。敌人不打不倒，任何反动势力都不会自动退出历史舞台。客观事物具有转化的可能性，并不等于已经变成现实性。可能性变成现实性，是一个充满斗争的发展过程，在这一过程中，最重要的是必须掌握和运用客观规律，充分发挥主观能动性，进行坚决的革命斗争，促使腐朽事物的死亡和新生事物的成长。在这个问题上，我们是彻底的革命论者，我们和怯懦的爬行的庸俗进化论没有任何共同之点。
    用革命的发展观点来看，新生力量一定战胜腐朽力量。但是，只有斗争，才能胜利；不斗争，是不能自胜的。斗争，就是转化工作，就是主观努力，就是革命的实践。战胜敌人，绝不是轻而易举的。打仗要一仗一仗地打，敌人要一部分一部分地消灭，堡垒要一个一个地夺取，阵地要一块一块地占领。战胜敌人，更没有平坦无阻的大道。我们是经过举世无匹的英勇斗争，克服了难以想像的艰难困苦，走过了漫长曲折的道路，才最后取得胜利的。我们同国内外敌人前前后后打了二十多年，单是第三次国内革命战争也就打了三年多，才最后推倒了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，在世界的东方站立起来。因此，我们体会到：要战胜敌人，不但首先要在战略上藐视敌人，而且一定要在战术上重视敌人，要不打无把握的仗，不打无准备的仗，要“以十当一”，积小胜为大胜。不如此，就不能够战胜敌人。
    战胜敌人的过程，又是由量变到质变，由部分质变到全部质变的过程。解放战争开始后，经过八个月的作战，歼敌七十一万余人，便停止了敌人的全面进攻。作战一年，歼敌一百一十二万人，改变了战争开始时敌强我弱的悬殊情况。于是，我军便转入了战略进攻，敌人便被迫转入了战略防御。辽沈战役⑨，歼敌四十七万二千人，东北全境解放，全国敌我形势起了根本变化，我军不仅在质量上占优势，而且在数量上也转为优势，这就决定了解放战争的加速胜利。再经过淮海和平津两大战役⑩，敌人的精锐部队，丧失净尽，至此，我们便取得了军事上的基本胜利。等到百万雄师下江南，我军进入战略追击阶段，南京伪总统府上的青天白日旗猝然下落，统治中国二十余年的蒋介石王朝便从此覆灭了。从量的积累到质的飞跃，这是新生力量战胜腐朽力量的过程，是人民解放军由战略防御转为战略进攻的过程，也是蒋介石反动集团由局部真老虎转化为全部纸老虎的过程。转化的决定环节，是中国人民的武装斗争。
    共产党人是做转化工作的。在第三次国内革命战争中，我们已经扭转了反革命的车轮，使之走向覆灭；推进革命的车轮，使之走向胜利。我们已经将黑暗的旧中国转化为光明的新中国。现在，我们正在继续斗争，不断革命，要把“一穷二白”的中国转化成为繁荣、富强、文明、昌盛的伟大社会主义的中国。这是翻天覆地、旋转乾坤的工作。改造世界，是共产主义者的崇高理想和豪迈事业；斗争再斗争，是我们的革命哲学。但是，在同凶恶的敌人进行生死格斗的时候，我们必须遵循毛泽东同志的这条军事辩证法：“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人。”
      关于保存自己和消灭敌人的问题
    保存自己消灭敌人是战争的基本原则，是战争的本质，是一切战争行动的根据，它贯彻于战争过程的始终。保存自己的目的，在于消灭敌人。如果只是为了保存自己，既达不到消灭敌人的目的，也保存不住自己。不保存自己，也不能很好地消灭敌人，甚至会被敌人消灭。毛泽东同志指出：“战争目的中，消灭敌人是主要的，保存自己是第二位的，因为只有大量地消灭敌人，才能有效地保存自己。”?
    保存自己、消灭敌人的两种基本手段是：进攻和防御。追击，只是进攻的继续；退却，乃是防御的继续。马克思列宁主义者认为：进攻和追击，是直接为了消灭敌人的，同时也是为了保存自己。防御和退却，是直接为了保存自己的，同时也是为了辅助进攻或准备转入进攻，从而消灭敌人。从革命战争的实践经验来看，在进攻与防御问题上，存在着两种完全对立的观点，一种是以毛泽东军事思想为代表的辩证法观点，另一种是形而上学的观点。辩证法的观点认为：进攻和防御是互相依存、互相渗透的，攻中有防，防中有攻；攻可以转而为防，防也可以转而为攻。在第二次国内革命战争中，毛泽东同志就是从这种观点出发，根据敌我力量的对比，在战争指导上，承认积极防御，反对消极防御；实行“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”?，“诱敌深入”和“集中优势兵力，选择敌人的弱点，在运动战中有把握地消灭敌人的一部或大部，以各个击破敌人”?等战略战术原则。这样做的结果，既歼灭了敌人，又发展了自己。而当时那些抱形而上学的观点的人则看不见进攻与防御的辩证关系，不去正确地估计敌我力量，在军事指导上，他们主张“全线出击”，“御敌于国门之外”，同强大的敌人拚消耗；在战争的过程中表现为进攻中的冒险主义，防御中的保守主义，退却时的逃跑主义。其结果，既不能很好地保存自己，又不能有效地消灭敌人，而是使革命战争遭受重大的挫折。
    在革命战争中，为了保存自己消灭敌人，要善于掌握进攻和防御的辩证规律，要灵活机动地运用进攻和防御两种手段。在战略防御中，我们必须采取战役战斗的进攻；如果没有战役战斗的进攻，就不可能把战略防御转为战略进攻。在转入战略进攻之后，又不能没有战役战斗的防御；如果忽略了这一面，就有可能在局部上遭受损失，甚至可能影响到全局。进攻和防御，互相推移，又互相转化。在革命战争中，我们必须善于进攻，力争进攻，千方百计地把防御转为进攻，这样才能够保存自己消灭敌人。问题在于，当强大的敌人对我们实行战略进攻，而我们处在战略防御地位、被迫进行内线持久作战的时候，我们应该怎样对敌人实行进攻呢？毛泽东同志曾经提出了关于战役战斗的正确的作战方针，这就是实行“外线的速决的进攻战”。这就是，在战役战斗中，我们要每战集中绝对优势兵力，从战场的外线进攻敌人的一路，以出其不意，攻其无备的战法，突然向运动中的敌人发动进攻，实行速战速决。这样一部分一部分地消灭敌人，使之由强变弱，又不断发展自己，使之由弱变强；敌我力量对比也随着不断消长变化：由敌优我劣走向敌我平衡，再由敌我平衡转为我优敌劣，我便可以由战略防御转为战略进攻，达到最后消灭敌人保存自己的目的。这便是保存自己消灭敌人之间，和战略战术上攻防变化之间的辩证关系。历次革命战争的历史事实一再证明，毛泽东同志的这一指导方针是无往而不胜利的。
    坚决打歼灭战，是保存自己消灭敌人的最有效的战法。毛泽东同志在第三次国内革命战争中所制定的十大军事原则?，集中突出地表现了毛泽东同志的歼灭战思想。
    打歼灭战，首要的问题是集中兵力。毛泽东同志说：“每战集中绝对优势兵力（两倍、三倍、四倍，有时甚至是五倍或六倍于敌之兵力），四面包围敌人，力求全歼，不使漏网。”?这便是战略上“以一当十”、战术上“以十当一”的作战原则。在第三次国内革命战争中，我们正是遵循着这个原则，大量地歼灭了敌人的。历史事实表明：在战役战斗的进攻战中，只有善于集中优势兵力，才能有效地各个歼灭敌人。毛泽东同志还教导我们：“以歼灭敌人有生力量为主要目标，不以保守和夺取地方为主要目标。”“但是，凡在敌我力量对比上能够保守或夺取的地方和在战役上战术上有意义的地方，则必须保守或夺取之，否则就是犯错误。”?第三次国内革命战争中我们执行了毛泽东同志的正确指示，战争开始后的头四个月，我军主动放弃一百零五座城市和一部分地区，却换取了歼敌三十余万人的胜利；第二个四个月，我军放弃八十七座城市，同时又收复和解放了八十七座城市，得失相当，但我却歼敌四十一万余人；到第三个四个月，得失相较，我军多得城市五十八座，同时又歼敌四十余万人。在整个解放战争中，从歼敌数十万到歼敌八百万；从放弃城市和土地，又保守和夺取城市和土地直到解放全国大陆；这些伟大的历史事实，生动地显示了在当时条件下歼灭敌人和城地得失的辩证关系，也充分证明了毛泽东同志的这一指导原则是完全符合客观规律的。
    在第三次国内革命战争中，如同在历次革命战争中一样，为了保存自己消灭敌人，我们既采取防御手段，又采取进攻手段；攻中有防，防中有攻；在战略上内线的持久的防御战中，采取战役战斗外线的速决的进攻战；战略上“以一当十”，战役战术上“以十当一”；放弃或保守或夺取一部分城和地，歼灭了敌人的有生力量，又取得更多的城和地。我们就是在这种对立统一的矛盾运动中，在毛泽东同志的军事辩证法指导下，首先，达到了战争的根本目的：保存自己消灭敌人。最后，达到了战争的政治目的：打倒蒋介石，建立新中国。
