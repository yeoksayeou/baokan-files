Xinhua News Agency, October 30th: San José - Amidst the escalating US imperialist plot to launch a military aggression against Cuba, various Costa Rican people's organizations have strongly expressed their determination to defend the rights of the Cuban people and resist the invasion by US imperialism.

The General Confederation of Workers of Costa Rica announced that it is prepared to implement the mutual support agreement signed with the Cuban Workers' Federation on May 13th of this year. This agreement stipulates that in the event of an imperialist aggression against Cuba, the General Confederation of Workers of Costa Rica will mobilize all its workers and agricultural laborer members to rise up and defend the fraternal Cuban people.

The Cuba Revolution Friendship Association issued a statement at its congress on the evening of the 28th, condemning the arrival of the US Marines at Guantanamo Bay as an open provocation and "the first step in the aggression against the fraternal people of Cuba."

Xinhua News Agency, October 30th: Montevideo - The Executive Committee and General Assembly of the United Workers' Confederation of Uruguay passed a resolution calling on the Uruguayan people to take immediate action to stop the threat of US imperialist armed aggression against Cuba.

After analyzing the serious situation in Cuba, which is facing the threat of aggression, the Executive Committee and the General Assembly of the Confederation decided to take the following actions: First, to suggest that all democratic forces in Uruguay immediately organize a grand demonstration to firmly express protest against the heinous measures against Cuba. Second, to suggest that all organizations, in the event of an invasion, immediately paralyze all activities and to suggest holding a mass meeting in University Square to decide on the activities to be launched. Third, to call on all trade unions, student organizations, and people's groups to take measures to support Cuba and to stop the activities of aggressive forces.

The National Liaison Committee of the Uruguayan Federation for Support of the Cuban Revolution, representing various worker and student organizations, professional groups, intellectuals, and people's organizations, issued a statement on the Cuban situation, warning the people that military aggression against Cuba is imminent; and "reiterates its determination to take all measures, morally and materially, to defend this fraternal country should an invasion be launched."

Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: Rio de Janeiro - Brazilian Labor Party Member of Parliament Lorival Fontes strongly supported the policies adopted by the Cuban government in the Senate on the 27th. He said that Cuban nationalism means loving the people and defending their interests, and implementing land reform.

Fontes pointed out that because Cuba implemented land reform, those who are unwilling to distribute land according to revolutionary principles retaliated and launched an economic war. However, the MP pointed out, "The policy of trusts, driven by selfishness, aimed at infiltration, and solely dedicated to plunder and theft, is unjustifiable, doomed to failure, and will never destroy a people united under the same banner and the same symbol."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 30th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today, strongly condemning the landing of US Marines at the Guantanamo military base in Cuba. The commentary pointed out, "This is a prelude to the US carrying out armed aggression against Cuba."

The commentary, entitled "World People Firmly Oppose the Dangerous Conspiracy of the United States Against Cuba," said that the US Marines are a force used by US imperialism to carry out aggression against weak countries. When US adventurers attempted to launch a war of aggression in Lebanon, the US Marines invaded the region.

The commentary condemned US imperialism's plot to strangle Cuba in order to prevent the national liberation movement throughout Latin America. The commentary emphasized that the Cuban people are ready to fight at any moment. Seven million Cuban people are united and determined to fight to the end to defend their motherland and defend the revolution. The Vietnamese people have consistently supported the just struggle of the Cuban people. The people of the world, especially the people of Latin America, are ready at all times to rise up and defend the Cuban Revolution.

    越“人民报”说美国增兵关塔那摩基地是武装侵略古巴的先声
    据新华社30日讯　圣约瑟消息：在美帝国主义加紧策划对古巴发动军事侵略的情况下，哥斯达黎加各人民团体强烈表示要保卫古巴人民的权利和抗击美帝国主义的进犯。
    哥斯达黎加总工会宣布，它准备实行今年5月13日同古巴工人联合会签订的互相支援的协议。这项协议规定，一旦帝国主义者对古巴发动侵略，哥斯达黎加总工会将动员全体工人和农业劳动者会员，起来保卫兄弟般的古巴人民。
    古巴革命之友协会28日晚上在代表大会上发表声明，谴责美国海军陆战队到达关塔那摩基地是公开的挑衅和“侵略古巴的兄弟人民的第一步”。
    据新华社30日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭工人统一工会执行委员会和工会全体大会通过决议，号召乌拉圭人民立即行动起来，制止美帝国主义武装侵略古巴的威胁。
    执行委员会和工会全体大会在分析了遭受侵略威胁的古巴的严重形势后，决定采取下列行动：第一，建议乌拉圭一切民主力量立即组织一次盛大的示威游行，坚决表示抗议反对古巴的罪恶措施。第二，建议各组织，如果一旦发生侵略，立即使一切活动陷于瘫痪，并建议在大学广场举行群众大会，以决定将要展开的活动。第三，号召一切工会组织、学生组织和人民团体采取有利于支援古巴的措施和制止侵略势力的活动。
    代表各工人和学生组织、职业团体、知识分子和人民团体的乌拉圭支援古巴革命联合会全国联络委员会在一项关于古巴局势的声明中，向人民提出了关于对古巴的军事侵略迫在眉睫的警告；并“重申假如竟然发动侵略，将采取一切措施在道义上和物质上保卫这个兄弟国家的决心。”
    据新华社29日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西工党议员洛里瓦耳·丰特斯27日在参议院强烈支持古巴政府所采取的政策。他说，古巴的民族主义意味着热爱人民和捍卫人民的利益，实行土地改革。
    丰特斯指出，因为古巴实行了土地改革，那些不愿意依据革命原则分配土地的人们就大肆报复并发动经济战争。但是，这位议员指出，“出于自私自利、旨在进行渗透、一味进行掠夺和盗窃的托辣斯政策，师出无名，注定要失败，决计毁灭不了在同一个旗帜同一个标志之下团结起来的人民。”
    新华社河内30日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论，强烈谴责美国海军陆战队在古巴的关塔那摩军事基地登陆的行为。评论指出，“这是美国实行武装侵略古巴的先声”。
    这篇题为“世界人民坚决反对美国对古巴的危险阴谋”的评论说，美国海军陆战队是美帝国主义用来向弱小国家进行侵略的部队。美国冒险家们企图在黎巴嫩发动侵略战争时，美国海军陆战队曾经进犯了这个地区。
    评论谴责美帝国主义阴谋扼杀古巴，以阻止整个拉丁美洲的民族解放运动。评论强调说：古巴人民正在时刻准备战斗。七百万古巴人民团结一致，誓为保卫祖国、保卫革命战斗到底。越南人民一贯支持古巴人民的正义斗争。世界人民，首先是拉丁美洲人民，在时刻准备起来保卫古巴革命。
