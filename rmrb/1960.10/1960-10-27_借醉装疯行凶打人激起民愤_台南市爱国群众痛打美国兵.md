Xinhua News Agency, October 25th dispatch: Taipei News: Recently in Taiwan there occurred an incident opposing American aggressors. A group of Tainan City rickshaw pullers and citizens on the 11th surrounded and fiercely beat eight American soldiers who, using drunkenness as a pretext, ran wild and assaulted people. Five of the American soldiers were beaten until their heads bled.

According to Taiwan's "Credit News Daily" reports, at 11:30 pm on the 11th, eight American soldiers stationed in Tainan City emerged from the "American Soldiers' Club" on Jiankang Road after drinking and causing a disturbance. Two of them, James Prince and Knisen, forcibly seized a rickshaw on the road and rode it recklessly. The owner of the rickshaw, Ye Guozhou, desperately tried to catch up, but the two American soldiers grabbed Ye Guozhou and beat him with fists and feet, causing him injury and bleeding. At that time, Ye Guozhou fought back with his fists. The other six American soldiers ran forward to surround and beat Ye Guozhou. This incident was quickly discovered by nearby rickshaw pullers, residents, pedestrians, and others, who picked up sticks, stones, wooden clogs, and other objects and angrily beat these eight American soldiers who were running amok and committing evil deeds. As a result, the American soldiers James Prince, Knisen, Pein, and two others were beaten with head lacerations. Patriotic citizens Ye Guozhou and two others were also injured by the American soldiers' assault.

Taiwanese newspapers reported that after receiving the news, the American military authorities stationed in Tainan dispatched a large number of American military police in collusion with a large number of police officers from the Chiang Kai-shek Group's Tainan City Police Department and so-called "foreign affairs military police" to rush to the scene of the incident to implement armed suppression of the patriotic masses. Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po" reported that the American aggressors' brutality and the Chiang Kai-shek Group's unreasonable measures of condoning the American military criminals while arresting patriotic citizens have aroused extreme indignation among the people of Tainan.

    借醉装疯行凶打人激起民愤
    台南市爱国群众痛打美国兵
    据新华社25日讯　台北消息：台湾最近发生一次反对美国侵略者事件，一群台南市三轮车工人和市民在11日把八名借醉装疯、行凶打人的美国兵包围痛打，其中五名美国兵被打得头破血流。
    据台湾“征信新闻报”消息，11日深夜十一时半，有侵占台南市的美军士兵八人从健康路“美军俱乐部”酗酒胡闹后涌出，其中詹姆斯·普林兹和克尼森两名美国兵在马路上强抢三轮车一辆，乱踏狂奔。车主叶国舟拼命赶上，这两个美国兵竟扭住叶国舟，拳脚交加，把他打伤出血。当时，叶国舟挥拳还击。另外六名美国兵就跑上前去围殴叶国舟。事情很快被附近的三轮车工人、居民、行人等发现，纷纷拿起棍棒、石头、木屐等，愤怒地痛打这八名行凶作恶的美国兵。结果把美国兵詹姆斯·普林兹、克尼森、皮恩等五人打得头部裂伤。爱国群众叶国舟等三人也被美军行凶打伤。
    台湾报纸说，侵驻台南美军当局接到消息后，竟派出大队美国宪兵勾同蒋介石集团台南市警察局的大批警察人员和所谓“外事宪兵”，赶往出事地点对爱国群众实行武装镇压。香港“文汇报”报道，美国侵略军的暴行和蒋介石集团纵容美军凶犯反而拘捕爱国群众的无理措施，已引起台南群众极度愤慨。
