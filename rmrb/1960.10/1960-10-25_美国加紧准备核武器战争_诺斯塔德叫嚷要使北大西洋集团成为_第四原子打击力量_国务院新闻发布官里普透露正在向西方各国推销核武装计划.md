U.S. Imperialism Rampantly Expands Armaments and Prepares for War, Aggravating the International Situation
    U.S. Intensifies Preparations for Nuclear Weapons War
    Norstad Clamors to Make the North Atlantic Group the "Fourth Atomic Strike Force"
    State Department Press Officer Lipp Reveals Nuclear Armament Plan Being Sold to Western Countries
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, October 24th: The U.S. government is stepping up efforts to peddle its so-called "Fourth Atomic Strike Force" plan, aiming to tie its "North Atlantic allies" to the U.S. nuclear war chariot.

    State Department Press Officer Lipp, in answering questions from reporters on the 21st, revealed that the U.S. government is currently studying the issue of nuclear armament for the North Atlantic Group, and some aspects involved have been discussed with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. According to United Press International on the 22nd, quoting senior U.S. government officials, "The Eisenhower government intends to formulate a concrete plan to grant nuclear armament to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as soon as possible, so that it can be submitted to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting scheduled for December in Paris in a timely manner... This plan is being formulated by the State Department, the Department of Defense, and the Atomic Energy Commission."

    Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group forces, U.S. General Norstad, openly advocated in a speech in Coventry, England, that the U.S. should make this aggressive military group the "Fourth Atomic Strike Force." Norstad also held talks with Adenauer on this issue. Subsequently, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Douglas and North Atlantic Group Secretary-General Spaak held talks with British Defense Minister Watkinson, while U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Whitney met with British Prime Minister Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Home on the evening of the 20th, selling them the U.S. plan. According to U.S. and British newspapers, the content of the U.S. plan is: The U.S. government will provide the North Atlantic Treaty Group countries with approximately 300 "Polaris" missiles, which will be installed on submarines, railway vehicles, or trucks, as the group's so-called "mobile strike force." These missiles will nominally be managed by four or five representatives from the North Atlantic Group member states, but in reality, they will be controlled by U.S. General Norstad himself. The British "Tribune" weekly, in discussing the U.S. war plan, pointed out: "Norstad's finger will be the only finger on the launch button (of these missiles)."

    The "New York Herald Tribune" revealed the U.S.'s intention to force the North Atlantic Group member states to accept the U.S. plan in an editorial on the 22nd. This Republican newspaper, reflecting the views of the U.S. government, clamored that in preparation for "nuclear war," the U.S. must "make every effort" to enhance the "strength" of this aggressive military group. At the same time, the editorial openly stated that the U.S. intends to use this plan to conveniently accelerate the nuclear armament of West Germany with nuclear weapons, to contain France to prevent it from seeking independence from the U.S., to make Britain more dependent on the U.S., and to entice other Western European countries to allow the U.S. to establish a network of nuclear missile bases on their territories. It said that the U.S. hopes that "the argument for independent North Atlantic Treaty Organization control of nuclear weapons may make it easier for some North Atlantic Treaty Organization members to agree to provide nuclear weapons to West Germany," so that France will be "less eager to pursue a go-it-alone nuclear policy," and "it can also alleviate some British concerns about U.S. bases, and the same effect on some smaller North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries."

    The U.S. war plan received a strong response from West Germany. According to West German newspapers, West German Chancellor Adenauer had already made the decision to support the U.S. plan during his recent meeting with Norstad in Italy. West German Defense Minister Strauss also said impatiently that West Germany supports "creating an atomic force for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

    国务院新闻发布官里普透露正在向西方各国推销核武装计划
    据新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府正在加紧兜售把它的“北大西洋盟国”绑在美国核战车上的所谓“第四原子打击力量”计划。
    国务院新闻发布官里普21日在回答记者提出的问题时透露，美国政府目前正在研究北大西洋集团的核武装问题，其中涉及的一些方面已同北大西洋公约组织进行了讨论。据合众国际社22日引用美国高级政府官员的话说：“艾森豪威尔政府打算早日拟好一项给予北大西洋公约组织核武装的具体计划，以便及时提交给预定12月份在巴黎举行的北大西洋公约组织会议……这个计划正由国务院、国防部和原子能委员会制订中。”
    北大西洋集团军队总司令、美国将军诺斯塔德最近在英国考文垂发表演说时，已公开鼓吹美国要使这个侵略性军事集团成为“第四原子打击力量”。诺斯塔德还就这个问题同阿登纳举行了会谈。接着美国国防部副部长道格拉斯和北大西洋集团秘书长斯巴克又分别同英国国防大臣沃金森会谈，而美国驻英国大使惠特尼也在20日晚上会见了英国首相麦克米伦和外交大臣霍姆，向他们推销美国这个计划。据美英报刊报道，美国计划的内容是：美国政府将向北大西洋公约集团各国提供约三百枚“北极星”式导弹，这些导弹将装置在潜水艇、铁路车辆或卡车上，作为这个集团的所谓“机动打击力量”。这些导弹名义上由北大西洋集团成员国的四、五个代表管理，但实际上将由美国将军诺斯塔德本人掌握。英国“论坛”周报在谈到美国这个战争计划时指出：“诺斯塔德的手指头将是按在（这些导弹）发射电钮上的唯一的手指头。”
    “纽约先驱论坛报”22日在一篇社论里透露了美国硬要北大西洋集团成员国接受美国这个计划的目的。反映美国政府意见的这家共和党报纸叫嚷，为了准备“核战争”，美国要“以一切努力”来增强这个侵略性军事集团的“实力”。同时，社论又露骨地表示，美国打算通过这个计划来方便地用核武器加速武装西德，以拑制法国使之不得向美国闹独立，使英国更加依附美国，并且诱骗其他西欧盟国让美国在它们的领土上建立核导弹基地网。它说，美国希望“关于北大西洋公约组织独立控制核武器的主张将可能使得某些北大西洋公约组织成员更易于同意向西德提供核武器”，使法国“不那么急于奉行一个单干的核政策”，还“可以和缓某些英国人士对美国基地的担心，而对某些较小的北大西洋公约组织国家也有同样的效果”。
    美国这个战争计划得到西德的有力响应。据西德报纸透露，西德总理阿登纳不久前在意大利同诺斯塔德举行会谈时，就已经作出了支持美国计划的决定。西德国防部长施特劳斯也急不及待地说，西德赞成“创建一支北大西洋公约组织的原子力量”。
