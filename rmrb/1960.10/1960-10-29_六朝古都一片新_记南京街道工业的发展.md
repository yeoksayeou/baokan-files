    A New Look for the Ancient Capital
    ——Development of Nanjing's Street Industry
    中共南京市委通讯组

    Nanjing is a famous ancient capital, once known for its decadence, and for more than twenty years before liberation, it was the center of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Nanjing have thoroughly eradicated the toxins of the old society through their hard work and built Nanjing into a new, productive, cultural, and socialist city.
    The changes in Nanjing are multifaceted. The comprehensive organization and involvement of the vast number of street residents, especially housewives, in production is one of the important symbols of this tremendous change. The city has more than 3,000 street production units, spread throughout the streets and alleys, with 100,000 street residents fighting hard on the production front, becoming more and more enthusiastic. The value of their output and processing fees last year was equivalent to five times the city's total industrial output value in the early days of liberation; the value of their output and processing fees in the first half of this year increased by another 100% compared with the same period last year.

    Producing What the Masses Need
    Older people still clearly remember that before liberation, Nanjing was flooded with foreign goods, all kinds of things from the East and the West. In the first few years after liberation, these so-called foreign goods gradually disappeared, but most of the daily necessities here were still produced and supplied by Shanghai and other fraternal cities. But now, it is very different. The myriad of daily industrial products needed for the people's economic life, from shoes, hats, and clothing to tables, chairs, and furniture, from vegetable baskets and rice bins to pots, bowls, ladles, and spoons, from sweets and pastries to children's toys, from sports equipment to stationery and paper, for wearing, using, eating, and playing, can mostly be produced by street industries. The small commodities and hardware produced by street industries total more than 2,000 varieties, accounting for more than 60% of the market supply. The files produced by the Xingguang Hardware Tool Factory in Baixia District have hundreds of specifications and models. The black and white iron cooperative of Jianye Commune produces dozens of specifications of white iron buckets, small-eared pots, economical stoves, kettles, fire tongs, dustpans, pot shovels, and iron spoons. The people praised the street industry well: Street factories, all kinds; big and small, filling streets and alleys; hardware machinery, chemical light industry; people's lives, properly arranged; the Party's wise leadership, the brilliance of the General Line.

    In order to better serve the people's lives, many street factories not only vigorously engage in production but also widely carry out repair services. At present, all people's communes in the city have repair service streets and repair service points. Shanxi Road in Gulou Commune has fifty-two shops mainly and concurrently engaged in repair business, operating 261 items, basically achieving whatever can be repaired. Jianye Commune recently established forty-three fixed service points, adopting the method of decentralized acceptance, centralized repair, and mobile service, undertaking the repair of umbrellas, bamboo and rattan ware, steel pots, and rubber shoes, a total of twenty-one repair items. In the past year, the repair industry of this commune has repaired 71,395 times for collective units, repaired 209,915 times for residents, and repaired 498,965 various tools and utensils, which not only facilitated the masses but also saved wealth for society. The masses are deeply satisfied with the repair business, calling the repair street the "omnipotent street" and saying that the repair shop is a "hospital" for treating utensils and appliances.

    The daily necessities produced by street factories not only attract customers in Nanjing but also some are famous in domestic and foreign markets. The popular Panda brand radio is one of them. When people mention Panda brand radios, they all think they are produced by large state-owned factories. Yes, it was indeed produced by large factories at first, but what about now? People would not think that more than 80% of its components are produced by street factories.

    The radio industry is like this, and so are other industries. At present, the city's telecommunications instruments, electromechanical, hardware, chemical, and other industrial departments have formed dozens of distinctive enterprise groups combining large, medium, and small state-owned factories as the center. These enterprise groups, like grape bunches, are organically combined, mutually conditional, and mutually promoting, to better serve socialist construction and the people's material and cultural life.

    The Story of Women Creating a Porcelain Factory
    In the mass movement of vigorously developing street industries, family members of workers and street women have always been the main force. Among the more than 100,000 workers in street factories throughout the city, more than 80% are women, and many factories are almost entirely women. They have demonstrated tremendous talent and wisdom in running factories, production, and making technical revolutions. The Taiping Porcelain Factory created by the "Women's Army" is one of many moving stories.

    In June 1958, in the upsurge of the whole people running industry, several housewives living on Zhujiang Road in Xuanwu People's Commune, with the help of street cadres, found a way to process services for large factories. At first, they didn't understand the technology, so they learned from master workers in large factories; without equipment, they asked for support from large factories; without factory buildings, they used the aisles of their own houses as workshops; without workbenches, they used stools and tables from home to replace them, and that's how they started the Taiping Porcelain Factory.

    "What men can do, I can do; men are heroes, and I am a heroine." They were not satisfied with processing simple tasks and were determined to do big tasks. Shortly after the factory was founded, they asked the large factory to undertake the "biscuit firing" task of high-frequency porcelain parts. Some master workers told them how complicated the biscuit firing technology was and how high the requirements were, saying with suspicion and concern: "I have never seen women fire kilns before. The kiln temperature is very high. Can you do it?" Some people also asserted that they "couldn't do it." However, they were not daunted or intimidated. They said: "Difficulties are afraid of people with ambition, and we are determined to be kiln burners." Jiang Fuzhen, the mother of six children, was the first to sign up, and together with sisters such as Sun Xiuying, formed a commando team for building and firing kilns, transporting bricks from several miles away, digging sand and mud from the pond, knocking on adobe, and mixing mud. Except for the main engineering of building the kiln, which was done by bricklayers, the rest was done by their voluntary labor. On March 8 last year, the coal kiln was completed and named "March 8th" kiln and put into production. Since there was no factory building, the coal kiln was built on an open space, so in the summer, kiln firing had to be done under the scorching sun, and in the winter, kiln firing had to be done in the wind and snow. At this time, Peng Chong, the First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, came to this factory and encouraged them. Jiang Fuzhen, Sun Xiuying, and others were even more motivated. They persevered and gradually honed a good technique. In just two months, they improved the structure of the coal kiln and innovated the operating technology several times. The output increased from seven or eight kilns per month to fifteen kilns, and the product qualification rate increased from 46% at the beginning of production to more than 95%.

    After more than a year of hard work, this factory has developed from the original seven people to 178 people. Except for the master workers sent by the large factory to help guide, all of them are women. From the original aisle to dozens of factory buildings, from no equipment to dozens of machines and instruments, from simple processing to the ability to produce more than 200 varieties of zigzag ceramic variable capacitors, radio high-frequency porcelain parts, and ultra-small variable capacitors. The Women's Army is growing rapidly, and the entire Taiping Porcelain Factory is also leaping forward at a high speed.

    The Road Traveled by the Dongfeng Machinery Factory
    On the north side of a small alley called Shiziqiao, south of Hunan Road, there is a small two-bay shop with a sign hanging at the door that says "Dongfeng Machinery Factory." Anyone passing by here is attracted by the sound of the machine motors coming from the house, and some curious people also poke their heads in to take a look. They see rows of lathes, drilling machines, milling machines, and planers neatly and orderly arranged in the house, and male and female workers are skillfully operating them. People who don't understand the "Dongfeng" family history would simply think that this is a local state-owned factory with a good technical and equipment foundation! Who would have thought that it was a street factory newly established by the Dingjiaqiao branch of the Gulou People's Commune?

    When this factory was first established in May 1958, all its assets were only three pairs of pliers and four files, wiping oil stains and filing large corner plates for large factories, and doing some piecemeal and simple processing. When they asked the large factory to give them some larger processing tasks, no one was willing. Once, they accepted a wire-tightening pliers processing task from the Electric Power Bureau. One part, a live wheel, could not be processed because there was no lathe, and the task was not completed. These things greatly stimulated the workers in this factory. They deeply felt that to keep the factory running, it was necessary to improve technology and get some equipment. So they made a vow to "throw away the red-tasseled spears and pick up the machine guns" and get a lathe to arm themselves. Soon, they bought a scrapped lathe from the Gulou Electric Motor Factory, wanting to transform it and use it. But this so-called "lathe" had nothing but a riddled frame. The workers at the Electric Motor Factory laughed at them and said, "What do you want this waste for? It's too high to be a stool. Melt it down, but you don't have an iron furnace." But the comrades in this factory did not waver in their revolutionary determination to get a lathe. They said: "There are no difficulties in front of heroes, and heroes emerge in the midst of difficulties." After racking their brains day and night, they finally came up with a local method to transform this broken lathe: fill the holes with melted lead, and if there is no drilling machine to drill holes, use a hand drill to drill a small hole first, and then slowly file it bigger with a file. But the difficulty was still ahead. It was not easy to level the uneven bed surface. At first, they used a file to nibble at it section by section, but after nibbling for four days and four nights, many blisters appeared on their hands, but it was still a waste. The method was forced out. They occasionally discovered the small thing that the iron plate would shine when ground on the cement floor. After discussing it, they decided to turn the bed surface upside down and drag it on the cement floor. After dragging it for more than three months, they finally leveled the bed surface and made a local lathe. This story quickly spread throughout the city. People sang: Three pairs of pliers and four files, the bed surface is not flat, file it with a file, if the file doesn't work, drag it on the road, riding the east wind to inspire great ambitions, the phoenix comes from the small chicken coop.

    Once one barrier is broken through, all barriers are broken through. With this lathe as a foundation, they were even more motivated and had even more confidence. Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of large factories, they have successively manufactured more than 50 sets of local equipment. In addition to purchasing and adding, there are now more than 130 sets of equipment. Not only that, in this year's technical revolution, they have also vigorously carried out process reforms and product reforms, reducing the more than 30 processes of steel wire pliers production to 25, and the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the entire factory has increased to more than 60%. Among the 421 workers, they already have their own lathe operators, milling operators, fitters, planers, and blacksmiths.

    The path of technical revolution taken by the Dongfeng Machinery Factory is actually the path taken by street factories throughout the city. At present, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of street factories in the city generally reaches 50% to 60%, and some factories have already achieved automation and semi-automation. It is truly: yesterday it was still manual, today it has become automatic, a change every day, small factories make great achievements.

    六朝古都一片新
    ——记南京街道工业的发展
    中共南京市委通讯组
    南京是著名的六朝金粉地，解放前的二十多年，它又是国民党反动统治的中心。解放以来，南京人民在党的领导下，经过自己的辛勤劳动，已经彻底铲除了旧社会的污毒，把南京建设成了一个生产的、文化的、社会主义的新城市。
    南京的变化是多方面的。广大街道居民，特别是家庭妇女全面组织起来，投入生产，就是这种巨大变化的重要标志之一。全市有三千多个街道生产单位，遍布大街小巷，十万街道居民奋战在生产岗位上，越干越有劲。他们去年创造出来的产值和加工费，相当于解放初期全市全年工业总产值的五倍；今年上半年的产值和加工费，比去年同期又增加一倍。
    群众需要什么就生产什么
    年纪稍长的人都还清楚地记得，解放前，南京是洋货充斥，什么东洋货啦，西洋货啦，五花八门。解放以后的头几年，这些所谓洋货已经逐渐绝迹了，但这里的各种日用品，大部仍然是上海和其他兄弟城市生产供应的。可是现在，大不相同了。人民经济生活所需要的名目繁多的日用工业品，从鞋、帽、服装到桌、椅、家具，从菜篮、米箩到锅、碗、瓢、勺，从糖果、糕点到儿童玩具，从运动器具到文具纸张，穿的、用的、吃的、玩的，街道工业大部都能生产。街道工业所生产的小百货、小五金，共有两千多个品种，占市场供应量的60％以上。白下区星光五金工具厂所生产的锉刀，有成百种规格型号。建邺公社黑白铁社生产的白铁桶、小耳锅、经济炉、水壶、火钳、畚箕、锅铲、铁勺等，各种规格也不下几十种。人民群众歌颂街道工业说得好：街道工厂，各式各样；大大小小，塞满街巷；五金机械、化工轻纺；人民生活，安排停当；党的英明领导，总路线的光芒。
    为了更好地为人民生活服务，许许多多的街道工厂，不仅大搞生产，而且广泛地开展修旧业务。目前，全市各人民公社，都有修旧服务街和修旧服务点。鼓楼公社的山西路，就有五十二家主营和兼营修旧业务的店铺，经营的项目达二百六十一项，基本上做到了有什么修什么。建邺公社最近设立了四十三个固定服务点，采取分散承接、集中修理、流动服务的方法，承接居民修补雨伞、竹藤器、钢精锅和胶鞋等二十一个项目的修旧业务。过去一年来，这个公社的修旧行业，给集体单位修理了七万一千三百九十五次，替居民修理了二十万九千九百一十五次，修理了各种工具、用器等四十九万八千九百六十五件，既方便了群众，又为社会节约了财富。群众对修旧业务深感满意，称修旧街是“万能街”，说修旧铺是治疗用具、器皿的“医院”。
    街道工厂生产的日用品，不仅吸引着南京市的顾客，而且有一部分还驰名国内外市场。人们所喜爱的熊猫牌收音机，就是其中之一。提起熊猫牌收音机，人们都认为它是国营大厂生产的。是的，起先它确是大厂生产的，可是现在呢？人们不会想到，它的80％以上的元件，都是由街道工厂生产了。
    无线电工业如此，其他工业也莫不如此。目前全市电讯仪表、机电、五金、化工等工业部门，已经形成了几十个以国营厂为中心的大、中、小相结合的各有特点的企业群。这些企业群像葡萄串一样，有机地结合在一起，互为条件，互相促进，更多更好地为社会主义建设和人民物质文化生活服务。
    妇女创建瓷件厂的故事
    在大办街道工业的群众运动中，职工家属和街道妇女一直是主力军。在全市街道工厂的十多万职工中，80％以上是妇女，不少工厂几乎都是妇女。她们不论在办厂、生产和大闹技术革命中，都显示了巨大的才能和智慧。“娘子军”创建的太平瓷件厂，就是许许多多动人故事中的一个故事。
    1958年6月，在全民办工业的热潮中，住在玄武人民公社珠江路的万冬、胡金英、冯子娥等几名家庭妇女在街道干部的帮助下，找到了为大工厂加工服务的门路。开始不懂技术，就向大厂老师傅学习；没有设备，就请求大厂支援；没有厂房，就把自己住房的走道隔起来使用；没有工作台，就从家里拿凳子、桌子来代替，就这样办起了太平瓷件厂。
    “男子能干我能干，男子英雄我好汉。”她们不满足于加工简单的活计，立志要干大活。在工厂创办后不久，她们向大厂要求承担高频瓷件的“素烧”任务。有的老师傅告诉她们，素烧技术如何的复杂，要求如何的高，既怀疑又关注地说：“从来未见妇女烧过窑，烧窑温度非常高，你们能行吗？”也有人断言她们“不行”。但是，她们并没有被难住、吓倒，她们说：“困难就怕有志人，决心做个烧窑人。”六个孩子的妈妈蒋福珍，第一个报了名，和孙秀英等姐妹组成了建窑、烧窑突击队，到几里路外去搬运砖头，到水塘里去挖沙泥，敲三合土，拌和泥浆。除砌窑主要工程是请瓦工干的外，其余都是她们义务劳动搞成的。去年3月8日煤窑建成，被命名为“三八”窑，投入了生产。由于没有厂房，煤窑是建在空地上的，因此，夏天烧窑要顶着烈日，冬天烧窑要迎着风雪。正在这个时候，市委第一书记彭冲同志来到这个厂，鼓励了她们一番，蒋福珍、孙秀英等的情绪更高了。她们坚持下来了，并且逐渐磨练出一手好技术。在短短两个月内，几次改进了煤窑结构和革新了操作工艺，产量由每月烧七、八窑提高到烧十五窑，产品合格率由初生产时的46％，提高到95％以上。
    经过一年多的艰苦奋战，这个厂已由原来的七个人，发展到一百七十八人，除大厂派来帮助指导的老师傅外，全部是妇女。由原来的一间走道发展到十数间厂房，由没有设备发展到数十台机械和仪表设备，由简单加工发展到能生产折线式陶瓷微调电容器、无线电高频瓷件、超小型微调电容器等二百多个品种。娘子军在迅速成长，整个太平瓷件厂也在高速跃进。
    东风机械厂走过的道路
    湖南路南边一条名叫狮子桥的小巷北首，有一家两开间的小铺房，门口挂着一块“东风机械厂”的牌子。凡是经过这里的人们，被房屋里传出来的机器马达声所吸引，有些好奇的人，还伸进头去看看。只见那一台台的车床、钻床、铣床、刨床，整整齐齐、有条有理地排列在房子里，男女工人们在熟练地操作着。不了解“东风”家世的人，简直会以为这是一家技术、设备基础很不错的地方国营厂哩！那儿会想到它是鼓楼人民公社丁家桥分社新办不久的一个街道工厂呢？
    1958年5月，这个厂刚办的时候，全部家当只有三把钳子四把锉，给大厂擦擦油丝、锉锉大角钣，搞一些零碎的简单的加工。当他们向大厂要求给一些较大的加工任务时，谁都不愿意。一次，他们接受电业局的一项紧线钳加工任务，有一个零件活轮，因为没有车床，加工不起来，没有完成任务。这些事，给这个厂的工人刺激很大，他们深深感到，要把厂办下去，不提高技术，不搞一些设备是不行的。于是就立下志愿，决心“丢掉红缨枪，拿起机关炮”，要搞部车床武装自己。不久，他们向鼓楼电机厂买到一台报废的车床，想把它改造改造用起来。可是这台所谓“车床”，除了一个百孔千疮的烂架子外，什么东西都没有。电机厂工人笑话他们说：“你们要这废物干吗？做板凳嫌高，回炉吧，你们又没得炼铁炉。”但是这个厂的工人同志，丝毫也没有动摇搞车床的革命决心，他们说：“英雄面前无困难，困难当中出英雄。”经过夜以继日地穷思苦钻，他们终于想到了改造这台破车床的土办法：洞孔用熔化了的铅来补，打眼没有钻床，就用手摇钻先钻个小眼，再用锉刀慢慢地锉大。但是困难还在后头，要把高低不平的床面磨平，是不易过的一道关。开始他们用锉刀一段段地啃，可是啃了四天四夜，手上起了许多血泡，却还是一个废料。办法是逼出来的。他们偶而发现铁板在水泥地上一磨就亮的小事，一商议就决定把床面翻倒在水泥地面上拖磨，拖磨了三个多月，终于把床面磨平了，制成了一台土车床。这个故事迅速在全市传开，人们歌唱说：三把钳子四把锉，床面不平锉刀锉，锉刀不行马路拖，乘着东风鼓大志，凤凰出自小鸡窝。
    一关通，百关通。他们有了这部车床作底子，干劲更足，信心更高。在党的领导和大厂支援下，先后又制造了五十几台土设备，加上购买增添，现已有一百三十多台设备。不仅如此，在今年的技术革命大风暴中，他们又大搞工艺改革和产品改革，把钢丝钳生产的三十几道工序改为二十五道，全厂机械化半机械化程度提高到60％以上。在四百二十一个职工中，已经有了自己的车工、铣工、钳工、刨工、锻工。
    东风机械厂所走的这条技术革命的路子，实际上也是全市街道工厂所走的路子。目前全市街道工厂机械化半机械化程度一般都达50％至60％，有的厂并已实现了自动化半自动化。正是：昨天还是手工，今天已成自动，一天一个变化，小厂大奏奇功。
