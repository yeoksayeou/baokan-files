Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 7th – The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an editorial on the 5th, strongly condemning U.S. imperialism for continuing to obstruct the discussion of the issue of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations at the fifteenth session of the General Assembly. The editorial stated that the U.S. ruling clique and their tools, at this session of the General Assembly, are still pursuing an abominable and hateful policy of discrimination, the most despicable slander and provocation against the People's China, thereby creating a completely abnormal and intolerable situation.

The editorial pointed out that restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations is not only related to the undeniable rights of the great 650 million people, but also to the interests of maintaining world peace.

The editorial continued: The practice of life itself proves that the People's China has made and is making outstanding contributions in the struggle to defend peace. She is one of the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, she has greatly promoted the extinguishing of the flames of war ignited by the imperialists in Korea, Indochina and other places, she proactively proposed turning the Pacific region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone, proposed that countries in this region, including the United States, conclude a non-aggression pact, and supported every initiative of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries that is conducive to the peace and security of all peoples. She has established normal relations with thirty-four countries, and her trade and cultural ties with other countries are spread all over the world. The recent signing of the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty in Beijing is another new example of China's peaceful policy. All these are facts that cannot be obscured by the slanders of the imperialists and their agents, the Belgrade revisionists. Whether the imperialists and their servants like it or not, the People's China is advancing rapidly on the road of socialism, and her important influence as a major peace-loving country in the world is growing and is increasingly making people see that without her participation, no major international issue can be thoroughly and effectively resolved.

The editorial said: "At the United Nations General Assembly, the U.S. delegation painstakingly plotted, fabricated rumors, and slandered, obstructing the discussion of the issue of China's legitimate rights at the General Assembly. They attempted to include the non-existent 'Tibet issue' on the agenda, while ignoring the discussion of issues of genuine concern to mankind that are related to defending world peace. How shameless and hateful this is. The attempt of U.S. imperialism is only to poison the international atmosphere, undermine the work of the United Nations, and attempt to cover up its continuous provocations and aggressive actions against the People's China, and to continue to support the compliant tool, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which represents nothing and should have been thrown into the garbage heap of history long ago. The U.S. imperialism’s slander that China is an aggressor cannot cover up the true face of U.S. imperialism as the real aggressor. It is the United States that forcibly occupies China's island of Taiwan, it is the United States that is brutally violating China's borders every day, and it is the U.S. generals who are openly making threatening statements against the People's China. However, China has given the aggressors across the ocean the due rebuff, exposing the true face of U.S. imperialism as the source of war and aggression and a serious threat to peace. China is advancing and will always advance on the road of peace and socialism, and does not need to obtain a pass from the U.S. State Department in this regard."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th – "Democratic Korea" recently published an editorial stating that the mechanical majority of the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, under the pressure of U.S. imperialism, passed a shameful "decision" at this session of the General Assembly not to discuss the issue of restoring the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, which has aroused great anger among people from all walks of life around the world who demand the immediate restoration of the legitimate rights of the great People's Republic of China in the United Nations. The Korean people resolutely condemn and oppose this "decision" of the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which has become a ferocious challenge to the principles of national self-determination proclaimed by U.S. imperialism to the fundamental principles of the United Nations.

The newspaper said that today, without the participation of the great People's Republic of China, important international issues concerning world peace and security cannot be resolved. No one can ignore the great development of the People's China in the socialist road, which has shocked the people of the world in the continuous Great Leap Forward, and its increasingly solid international prestige. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, the great Chinese people, holding high the banner of the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, have completed the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule in two years. Regardless of U.S. imperialism's military aggression and crazy blockade policy, the People's Republic of China has ascended to the status of a veritable world power.

The commentary continued, reality proves that the time has long come for the United Nations to grant the legitimate seat to the People's Republic of China, which represents the 650 million Chinese people, and to drive out the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has become a political zombie. U.S. imperialism does not face up to this obvious fact, and frantically thwarts the will of the people of the world to resolve this mature international issue. However, U.S. imperialism's sophistry and slander cannot deceive the conscience of the world. The mastermind who has tarnished and trampled on the Charter of the United Nations is the center of world reaction, the fierce enemy of peace and national independence – U.S. imperialism.

The commentary went on to condemn U.S. imperialism for rudely trampling on the Charter of the United Nations, forcibly occupying Taiwan, and creating the criminal conspiracy of "two Chinas."

The commentary emphasized that since ancient times, there has been only one China. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. At the same time, the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a sacred and inviolable right belonging to China's internal affairs. Precisely because of this, the 650 million Chinese people have clearly explained to the world their strong determination not to allow U.S. imperialism to create the conspiracy of "two Chinas," and are continuing their sacred struggle.

The commentary said that the contribution and achievements made by the People's China for consolidating world peace and the security of the people are enormous. The firm peace-loving stance of the People's China has heavily hit and is hitting the imperialists' aggression and war policies headed by U.S. imperialism.

The editorial concluded that today, the People's Republic of China, loyal to the cause of peace, socialism and national independence, is effectively crushing the resistance of the imperialists headed by U.S. imperialism, and is growing stronger and developing, and its influence on the international stage is further expanding.

    阿朝两国报纸痛斥美国对中国的造谣诬蔑
    中国为巩固世界和平作出巨大贡献
    据新华社地拉那7日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”5日发表社论，强烈谴责美帝国主义在联大第十五届会议上继续阻挠对中华人民共和国在联合国的合法代表权问题的讨论。社论说，美国统治集团和他们的工具在本届大会上，仍然对人民中国奉行着可恶又可憎的歧视政策、最卑鄙的造谣诬蔑和挑衅的政策，从而造成完全不正常和不可容忍的局面。
    社论指出，恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，不仅关系着伟大的六亿五千万人民的无可争辩的权利问题，而且关系着维护世界和平的利益。
    社论接着说：生活实践本身证明了人民中国在保卫和平的斗争中作出了、并正在作出卓越的贡献。她是和平共处五项原则的创始者之一，她大大地促进了帝国主义者所燃起的在朝鲜、印度支那等地战火的扑灭，主动创议把太平洋地区变为无核武器地区，创议这个地区各国间、包括美国在内缔结互不侵犯的公约，并支持了苏联和其他社会主义国家的每一个有利于各国人民和平和安全的倡议。她同三十四个国家建立正常关系，同别国的贸易、文化联系则遍布全球。最近在北京签订的中缅边界条约是中国的和平政策的又一新范例。这一切都是事实，是帝国主义者及其代理人贝尔格莱德修正主义者的诬蔑所蒙蔽不了的。不管帝国主义者及其奴仆喜欢不喜欢，人民中国正在社会主义的道路上迈着快速的步伐前进，她作为世界一个爱好和平的大国的重要的影响正在日益增长，也日益清楚地在使人们看到，没有她的参加，任何重大国际问题都不可能彻底和有效地解决。
    社论说：“在联合国大会上美国代表团千方百计地蓄谋、造谣、诬蔑，阻挠在联大对中国的合法权利问题的讨论。他们企图把不存在的‘西藏问题’列入议程，而对人类真正关注的关系着保卫世界和平的问题的讨论却置之度外，这是何等的无耻何等的可恶。美帝国主义的这种企图只是在于毒化国际气氛，破坏联合国的工作，力图掩盖对人民中国的不断的挑衅和侵略行动，仍旧扶植不代表任何东西的、早就应当扔到历史的垃圾堆里去的顺从工具蒋介石集团。美帝国主义说什么中国是侵略者的这种诬蔑，掩盖不了美帝国主义者的真正侵略者的面目。武力侵占中国岛屿台湾的是美国，天天在粗暴侵犯中国边界的是美国，对人民中国公开地发表威胁性声明的是美国的将军们。但是，中国对大洋彼岸的侵略者给予了应有的回击，揭露了美帝国主义作为战争和侵略的根源、对和平的严重威胁的本来面目。中国正在、并将永远在和平和社会主义道路上向前迈进，而不需要取得美国国务院的这方面的通行证。”
    据新华社平壤7日电　“民主朝鲜报”最近发表编辑部评论说，联大总务委员会的机械多数在美帝国主义的压力下通过了在本届联大不讨论恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权问题的可耻的“决定”，这引起了要求立即恢复伟大的中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的全世界各界人民的极大愤怒。朝鲜人民坚决谴责和反对成为美帝国主义对联合国根本原则所宣布的人民自主权的凶恶的挑战的联大总务委员会的这个“决定”。
    这家报纸说，今天，没有伟大的中华人民共和国的参加，就不能解决有关世界和平和安全的重要的国际问题。任何人也不能无视人民中国在社会主义大道上使世界人民为之震惊的持续大跃进的巨大的发展面貌和日益提高的稳固的国际威信。伟大的中国人民在中国共产党的英明领导下，高举着社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的旗帜，在二年的时间内提前三年完成了第二个五年计划。中华人民共和国不顾美帝国主义的军事侵略和疯狂的封锁政策，已经登上了名副其实的世界大国的地位。
    评论接着说，现实证明，联合国向代表六亿五千万中国人民的中华人民共和国提供合法席位、赶走已经成为政治僵尸的蒋介石集团的时候早已到来了。美帝国主义不正视这一俨然的事实，疯狂地挫折世界人民要求解决这一成熟的国际问题的意志。但是，美帝国主义的诡辩和中伤也欺骗不了世界的良心。沾污和蹂躏了联合国宪章的主谋者就是世界反动的中心、和平和民族独立的凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义。
    评论接着谴责美帝国主义粗暴地蹂躏联合国宪章、武装强占了台湾、并制造“两个中国”的犯罪阴谋。
    评论强调说，亘古以来，只有一个中国。台湾是中国的不可分割的一部分。同时，中国人民解放台湾的斗争是属于中国内政的神圣不可侵犯的权利。正因为如此，六亿五千万中国人民向全世界清楚地阐明了决不容许美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋的坚强的决心，并继续着自己的神圣的斗争。
    评论说，人民中国为巩固世界和平和人民的安全作出的贡献、建立的功绩是巨大的。人民中国的坚决的爱好和平的立场，沉重地打击了和正在打击着以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者侵略和战争政策。
    社论最后说，今天，忠于和平、社会主义和民族独立事业的中华人民共和国，正在有成效地粉碎着美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者的反抗，正在壮大和发展着，它在国际舞台上的影响进一步地扩大着。
