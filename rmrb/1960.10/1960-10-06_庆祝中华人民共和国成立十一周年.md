    Telegram of Greetings from the Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran
    Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party received a telegram from Radmanesh, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran, and Secretary Kambakhsh, congratulating our country on its National Day. The full text is as follows:
    To the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Beijing
    Dear Comrades:
    On this glorious holiday in the history of national liberation movements of all countries, the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran, on behalf of all party members and the entire Iranian people, extends our congratulations to you!
    The great Chinese people, liberated from the oppression of imperialism and having established a truly people's democratic system in their own country, are constantly moving from victory to victory under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.
    Our people, struggling under conditions of oppression and terror, watch the achievements of our Chinese brothers with hope and admiration. At the same time, the achievements of the Chinese people have aroused the anger of the enemies of socialism—all sorts of imperialists, especially US imperialism. However, all attempts by the imperialists will be shattered by the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The rock-solid unity of the socialist camp is the best guarantee for the victory of our common cause.
    Dear Comrades! We wish you even greater achievements in your great cause!
    The day is not far off when our people will cast off the shackles of oppression and embark on the path to true human happiness!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the inspirer of the Chinese people's victory!
    May the unity of the socialist camp—the guarantee for the speedy victory of our common cause—be further consolidated!
      Radmanesh, First Secretary, Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran
                                Secretary Kambakhsh
