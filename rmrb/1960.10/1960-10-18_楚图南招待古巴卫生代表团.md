Xinhua News Agency, October 17th: Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association, held a reception this evening to warmly welcome the Cuban health delegation headed by Cuban Minister of Health, José Román Machado Ventura.

Chu Tunan spoke at the reception. He extended a warm welcome to the Cuban friends who came from the forefront of the struggle against U.S. imperialism. He said that the Chinese people have always expressed sincere admiration for the Cuban people's heroic struggle against U.S. imperialism. Recently, we were even more pleased to see the great victory of the Cuban people in suppressing counter-revolutionary activities in the Escambray Mountains and the sentencing of American spies to death. The Chinese people firmly believe that the Cuban people's struggle to defend national sovereignty and safeguard the fruits of the revolution will further deliver a heavier blow to U.S. imperialist intervention and aggression plots.

Chu Tunan said that the Chinese people were very excited to hear Cuban Prime Minister Castro solemnly announce the "Havana Declaration" in Civic Square. This declaration powerfully expressed the heroic spirit of the Cuban people and the deep desire of the people of Latin American countries to oppose U.S. imperialist intervention and aggression and to safeguard national independence. The Chinese people resolutely support the "Havana Declaration" and will fight to the end for our common cause - opposing U.S. imperialism and defending world peace.

Head of the delegation, Machado Ventura, spoke amidst warm applause. He praised the great achievements made by the Chinese people. He said that the Chinese revolution is an example for the people of all countries in the world, and the development of China and other socialist countries in politics, economy, culture, and society fully demonstrates that the tide of socialist thought is advancing so powerfully that no force in the world can stop it.

Machado Ventura said that the Chinese revolution drove out all imperialist, colonialist, and reactionary forces in China. The road of the Chinese People's Revolution is a road of heroic struggle, the liberation of the Chinese people is a true and profound liberation, and the victory of the Chinese revolution shows the people of the world that the Chinese people are a heroic people.

After introducing the heroic struggle of the Cuban people against U.S. imperialism, Machado Ventura said that the Cuban people will do their best to complete the tasks put forward in the "Havana Declaration" announced by Prime Minister Castro. The Cuban people hope that the people of all Latin American countries will gain freedom in politics, economy, culture, and society.

Machado Ventura emphasized that, due to the support of socialist countries for Cuba, Cuba's revolution - against U.S. imperialist aggression and interference - can continue to advance. Cuba has lost a false friend, but has gained many true friends.

He finally said that we firmly believe that with the support of these friends, and relying on their own strength, the Cuban people will surely be able to achieve equal rights and freedom, and the Cuban revolution will surely achieve final victory.

The speeches of Chu Tunan and Machado Ventura aroused warm and continuous applause from the audience.

Li Dequan and Cui Yitian, Ministers of the Ministry of Health, Zhou Erfu, Vice President of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association, Luo Jun, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Lu Xuzhang, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, Shen Jian, Director of the American and Australian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Huang Jiasi, Hu Chuankui, Wu Jieping, and Li Ting, people from the medical and health circles in the capital, attended the reception.
