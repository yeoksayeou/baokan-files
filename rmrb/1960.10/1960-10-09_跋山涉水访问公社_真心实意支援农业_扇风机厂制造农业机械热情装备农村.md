    Trekking to Visit Communes, Sincerely Supporting Agriculture
    Fan Factory Enthusiastically Equipping Rural Areas with Agricultural Machinery
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Jilin City Fan Factory workers, in the movement to support agriculture, trekked to visit the Da Boji Commune, nearly 300 li away, making every effort to support the commune with over a hundred kinds of agricultural machinery equipment and tools, and helped the commune establish an agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing plant, becoming a red banner in Jilin City's support for agriculture.
    The Jilin City Fan Factory was originally a tin handicraft production cooperative, which developed into a local state-owned factory in 1958. Currently, it has fewer than 300 workers, most of whom come from rural areas and have deep feelings for the peasants. When the Party issued the call to support agriculture, it quickly received enthusiastic response from the employees. In order to better support agriculture, the factory's Party branch, on the one hand, organized all employees to study documents and establish the idea of "taking agriculture as the foundation." On the other hand, it sent cadres and workers to form a visiting group to visit the Da Boji Commune, located in a mountain gully nearly 300 li away from the city. The workers personally witnessed the peasant brothers' soaring enthusiasm in fighting nature to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture, and the clumsy and backward labor tools that were incompatible with it, and further realized the great significance of accelerating agricultural technical transformation for the development of the national economy. After the visiting group returned to the factory and reported to all the employees, everyone unanimously expressed their willingness to contribute to helping rural technical transformation, and decided on the spot to immediately transfer a lathe to arm the countryside with machinery. At that time, the factory had a total of seven lathes, two of which were new "sealed can" gear lathes, and five were old-fashioned belt lathes. Which one would be better to support? Belt lathes are more troublesome to operate, and they may not be able to be used immediately when taken to the countryside; although "sealed can" lathes are good, there are only two in the factory. The Party branch believes that this is not just a question of which lathe to support, but a test of whether the workers' support for agriculture is conscious, voluntary, and sincere. Therefore, it specifically organized workers to launch a major debate, and as a result, the idea of sincerely and wholeheartedly serving agriculture won. Miao Runqiang, the leader of the lathe team, not only happily took out the "sealed can" lathe he used, but also personally went to the commune to help with installation. Then, the workers transformed all five belt lathes in the factory into "sealed can" lathes. One visit and one debate made the idea of serving agriculture wholeheartedly take root firmly in the minds of the employees.
    For more than half a year, the factory has organized workers to go to the commune "to visit relatives" seven times, proactively understanding needs and meeting needs. Because of frequent "visits to relatives," the factory's affection for the Da Boji Commune has become deeper and deeper. Although they feel that their own manpower and material resources are insufficient, they try their best to solve the demands put forward by the countryside. In the past six months, it has supported the Da Boji Commune with 15 mechanical equipment such as lathes, large radial drills, threading lathes, and sawing machines, and more than 100 kinds of tools, which is equivalent to more than a quarter of the factory's original equipment. In addition, it has also trained three young technicians for the commune. Recently, the factory sent a versatile technician to settle down in the commune and help the rural construction for a long time.
    Thanks to the selfless assistance of the Jilin City Fan Factory, the Da Boji Commune in the mountain gully has established an agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing plant with a full set of mechanical equipment for turning, fitting, riveting, and welding. This year, the plows, sickles, power rice threshers, etc. used for the commune's autumn harvest have all been manufactured by themselves. The employees of the fan factory have also improved their understanding through supporting agriculture, and are full of energy and enthusiasm, and production is booming. They have carried out in-depth technical revolution and technical innovation, manufactured equipment, and after taking out some equipment to support the countryside, the factory's equipment has not only not decreased but has increased by 31.1％, and production has comprehensively exceeded the state plan every month.

    跋山涉水访问公社　真心实意支援农业
    扇风机厂制造农业机械热情装备农村
    本报讯　在支援农业运动中，吉林市扇风机厂的工人们跋山涉水，访问相隔近三百华里的大勃吉公社，千方百计支援该社农业机械设备和工具百种以上，并帮助该社建立了一个农业机械修造厂，成为吉林市支援农业的一面红旗。
    吉林市扇风机厂原来是一个洋铁手工业生产合作社，从1958年起发展成为地方国营工厂。目前工人不到三百人，绝大部分工人来自农村，和农民有着深厚的感情，当党提出支援农业的号召后，很快得到了职工的热烈响应。为了更好地支援农业，这个厂的党支部一面组织全体职工学习文件，树立“以农业为基础”的思想。一面派干部和工人组成访问组，跋山涉水，到远离城市近三百华里、地处大山沟中的大勃吉公社参观访问。工人们亲眼看到农民兄弟为争取农业大丰收与自然搏斗的冲天干劲，和与此不相适应的笨重而落后的劳动工具，进一步认识到加速农业技术改造对发展国民经济的重大意义。访问组回厂向全体职工汇报后，大家一致表示要为帮助农村技术改造出力，并当场决定要马上抽调一台车床，用机械来武装农村。当时全厂共有七台车床，两台是新型“闷罐”式的齿轮车床，五台是旧式的皮带车床。支援哪一台为好呢？皮带车床操纵比较麻烦，拿到农村不一定马上就能使用；“闷罐”式车床虽好，全厂只有两台。党支部认为：这不仅是支援哪一台床子的问题，而是考验工人们支援农业是否自觉自愿真心实意的问题。于是专门组织工人展开了一场大辩论，结果真心实意支援农业的思想得胜。车工组长苗润强不仅高兴地把自己使用的“闷罐”式车床拿出来，还亲自到公社帮助安装。接着，工人们又把厂内五台皮带车床都改造成“闷罐”式车床。一次访问，一场辩论，使全心全意为农业服务的思想在职工中扎下坚实的根子。
    半年多来，全厂曾经七次组织工人到公社“走亲戚”，主动了解需要，满足需要。由于经常“走亲戚”，这个工厂对大勃吉公社感情越来越深。虽然自己的人力、物力都感到不足，但他们对农村提出的要求，却是千方百计予以解决。半年多来，共支援大勃吉公社车床、大摇臂钻、套丝床、锯床等十五台机械设备和上百种工具，等于工厂原有设备的四分之一还多。另外，还为公社培训了三名青年技术员。最近工厂又派出一名多面手技工到公社安家落户，长期帮助农村建设。
    由于吉林市扇风机厂的无私援助，大山沟里的大勃吉公社已经建立了一个具有车、钳、铆、焊全套机械设备的农业机械修造厂。今年这个公社秋收所用的犁、镰刀、动力打稻机等已全部由自己制造。扇风机厂的职工们也通过支援农业，提高了认识，意气风发，干劲十足，生产蒸蒸日上。他们深入开展技术革命和技术革新，制造设备，拿出一部分设备支援农村后，本厂的设备不仅没有减少反而增长了31.1％，生产月月全面超额完成了国家计划。　（蒋光宜）
