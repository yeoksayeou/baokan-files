Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Telegram: Sichuan Province's light industry departments are actively implementing the "five self-reliance" movement proposed by the Provincial Party Committee, namely self-reliance in raw materials, fuels, transportation, power, and machine repair, and are vigorously developing diversified operations centered on coal, achieving significant results.

To date, the province's light industry departments have established 424 factories and mines producing major raw materials, fuels, and materials such as coal, iron, steel, caustic soda, sulfur, timber, cement, rubber, and sulfuric acid, with 105 already in production. Due to the development of diversified operations, many light industrial factories have achieved partial or basic self-sufficiency in major fuels, raw materials, and materials, not only ensuring the completion of their own production tasks but also promoting the overall development of industrial production.

In the "five self-reliance" movement in Sichuan Province's light industry departments, leading cadres at all levels went deep into the front lines of production, educating cadres and workers to recognize that vigorously developing diversified operations and comprehensive utilization is an important measure for tapping enterprise potential and implementing increased production and thrift, which can both ensure key tasks and promote the sustained leap forward in the enterprise's production. Various localities first focused on self-operated coal mines to establish fuel bases. For example, the light industry department of Luzhou Prefecture first restored production in more than 20 old coal kilns that had been shut down in the past.

The light industry system adopted various forms in running factories and mines for diversified operations, depending on the circumstances: one was self-operated by the factory, with labor and funds solved by the enterprise itself, and the products belonged to the enterprise, which was the main form. Another was uniformly organized by the light industry bureaus of various counties (cities), with labor and funds planned uniformly by the benefiting factories and mines; the distribution of products, in addition to giving priority to the benefiting factories, was uniformly adjusted by the counties (cities). Still another was jointly operated by factories and communes, using the existing labor and equipment of the commune's factories and mines for production, and, where possible, supplementing labor or assisting the commune in assembling power equipment to expand production capacity and increase output; most or all of the profits accumulated by these factories and mines were obtained by the commune, and the products were distributed by both parties in agreed-upon proportions.

Regarding the labor and technical strength needed for diversified operations, various factories also resolved this by vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, and improving labor efficiency. After the Tongliang County paper industry promoted the automatic operation method for paper production in technical innovation, a total of 895 people were saved, solving the need for vigorously developing diversified operations. The Luzhou City light industry system changed some manual operations to semi-mechanized and mechanized production, saving more than 1,000 workers, who were put into fuel, raw material production, and transportation work. In addition, various places also adopted methods such as "sending out, inviting in, and one teacher leading many apprentices" to train technical workers in production. In many places, the industrial bureaus of various counties (cities) also organized technical personnel to provide technical guidance to the raw material, material, and fuel factories and mines they ran.

This newspaper reports: The Wuqiang Central Store in Shen County, Hebei Province, actively organizes and assists industrial departments in the production of winter small commodities. Currently, more than 200 kinds of winter small commodities such as cotton hats, cotton gloves, felt shoes, stoves, and kettles have been produced.

In order to better support the vigorous development of agriculture and further meet the needs of commune members' lives, under the leadership of the commune party committee, this store, in coordination with the industrial department, quickly switched to winter small commodity production after completing the production of "three autumns" tools. In order to ensure that the variety, quantity, specifications, and quality of winter small commodities meet the requirements of the commune members, they first sent nine experienced cadres to conduct a systematic investigation of the technical strength and equipment capacity of the commune and brigade factories, and at the same time, they went deep into the canteens and square fields of the production teams, understood the needs of the commune members for winter small commodities by working with the commune members and chatting during breaks, and then sent nine cadres to live in the factories (groups) to help formulate production plans and solve raw material supply problems. The store sent 64 resident team workers, under the leadership of the local party committee, to engage in production during the day and procurement at night. In September, they purchased more than 14,000 jin of small steel, more than 30,000 jin of pig iron, and a batch of old felt pieces, miscellaneous hair, and bamboo strips, which were supplied to the factories in a timely manner. At the same time, a deputy manager led four technical personnel from the factory to Shandong and neighboring counties to learn some small commodity production techniques. They also helped the factory manufacture shoe eyelet machines, bamboo splitting machines, and other machines, which improved production efficiency.

    四川轻工业部门自办原料、材料、燃料厂矿四百多个
    开展多种经营　增产轻工业品
    深县武强中心商店就地取材及早准备冬季小商品
    据新华社成都电　四川省轻工业部门积极贯彻省委提出的自办原料、燃料、运输、动力、机修的“五自办”运动，大搞以煤炭为中心的多种经营，获得了显著效果。
    到目前为止，全省轻工业部门办起了生产煤、铁、钢、烧碱、硫磺、木材、水泥、橡胶、硫酸等主要原料、燃料、材料的厂矿四百二十四个，已投入生产的有一百零五个。由于开展多种经营，许多轻工业工厂所用的主要燃料、原料、材料，已做到部分自给或基本自给，不但保证了本厂生产任务的完成，而且促进了整个工业生产的全面发展。
    四川省轻工业部门在开展“五自办”运动中，各级领导干部都深入生产第一线，教育干部和职工群众，使大家认识到，大搞多种经营、综合利用，是发挥企业潜力、贯彻增产节约的重要措施，既能保证重点，又能促使本企业的生产持续跃进。各地首先以自办煤矿为主，建立燃料基地。如泸州专区轻工业部门首先就是把过去停产的二十来个旧煤窑恢复了生产。
    轻工业系统在自办多种经营的厂矿时，根据不同情况，采取了多种不同的形式：一种是由本厂自办，劳动力、资金由本企业自行解决，产品归本企业所有，这是主要形式。另一种由各县（市）轻工业局统一筹办，劳动力、资金由受益厂矿统一筹划；产品的分配，除优先照顾受益厂以外，由各县（市）统一调剂。还有一种是由工厂与公社合办，利用公社现有厂矿的劳力和设备进行生产，在可能条件下，适当补充劳力或者协助公社装配动力设备，扩大生产能力，提高产量；这些厂矿积累的利润大部分或全部为公社所得，产品由双方协商按适当比例分配。
    对于多种经营需要的劳力和技术力量；各厂还通过大搞技术革新和技术革命，提高劳动效率后调剂解决。铜梁县造纸工业在技术革新中推广造纸生产自动作业法后，共节约了八百九十五人，解决了大办多种经营的需要。泸州市轻工业系统改部分手工操作为半机械化、机械化生产，节约了一千多个工人，投入燃料、原料生产和运输工作。此外，各地还采用“派出去，请进来，一师带多徒”等办法，在生产中培养技术工人。许多地方还由各县（市）工业局组织技术人员，到各自办的原料、材料、燃料厂矿巡回辅导技术。
    本报讯　河北省深县武强中心商店积极组织和协助工业部门生产冬季小商品，目前已生产出棉帽、棉手套、毡鞋、火炉、水壶等冬季小商品二百多种。
    这个商店为了更好地支援大办农业，进一步满足社员生活上的需要，在公社党委的领导下，协同工业部门，在完成“三秋”工具生产以后，迅速转入了冬季小商品生产。为了使冬季小商品的品种、数量、规格、质量适合社员群众的要求，他们首先派出九名有经验的干部，对社队工厂的技术力量和设备能力进行了系统的调查，同时深入生产队的食堂、方田，通过和社员共同劳动，利用干活休息时叙家常，了解了社员对冬季小商品的需要，然后又派出九名干部分别住在各工厂（组）帮助制定生产计划，解决原材料供应等问题。商店派出了六十四名驻队职工，在当地党委的领导下，白天搞生产，晚上搞收购，在9月份就收购起小钢材一万四千多斤，生铁三万多斤，并收购了一批旧毡片、杂毛、竹篾等，适时供应了工厂的需要。同时，由一名副经理带领工厂四个技术人员到山东和邻县，学习了一些小商品的生产技术。他们还帮助工厂制造了鞋眼机、破篾机等机具，提高了生产效率。
