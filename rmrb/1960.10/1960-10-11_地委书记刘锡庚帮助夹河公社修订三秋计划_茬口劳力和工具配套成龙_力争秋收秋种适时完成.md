This newspaper reports from Nanjing on the 10th: The Jiahe People's Commune in Tongshan County, Jiangsu Province, has formulated a plan of "Autumn Harvest and Planting, Coordinated into a Complete System, Rational Use of Forces, and Phased Operations" to ensure the timely completion of the autumn planting task before "Frost's Descent".

This plan was formulated by the working group led by Liu Xigeng, First Secretary of the Xuzhou Prefectural Party Committee, and Jiang Gui, First Secretary of the Tongshan County Party Committee, after repeated studies with the commune party committee secretary, brigade branch secretaries, and cultivation personnel.

The prominent contradiction in the autumn harvest and planting of the Jiahe Commune is that the autumn sowing area is large, the requirements are high, the stubble is late, and the time is tight. Harvesting, plowing, and planting are squeezed together, and if not arranged properly, one thing will be neglected for another, and the agricultural season will be missed. The autumn sowing area of the entire commune is 57,000 mu, an increase of 3,960 mu over last year, of which 54,000 mu is for the three wheats, all of which are required to be planted with small plows and manure application, increasing the amount of labor by two times compared to the past. Among the three wheats, only 17,900 mu are early stubble. Due to the impact of autumn rains, the early stubble land was not plowed early after early harvesting. The cultivated fallow land, after being rained on, has hardened soil and needs to be plowed again. The remaining 36,100 mu are soybean, mung bean, and sweet potato stubble, which have not yet been cleared. Therefore, autumn plowing is delayed by about half a month compared to last year. According to the season, the most suitable time for wheat sowing here is around "Cold Dew". In this short period of time, it is a very arduous task to harvest 46,000 mu of late autumn crops, plant 57,000 mu of the three wheats and rapeseed, and manage 8,000 mu of autumn vegetables and carrots.

Faced with these contradictions, what should we do? Through sorting and accounting, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to find favorable factors to overcome these contradictions. Each specific problem in the autumn harvest and planting was effectively solved, making it entirely possible to sow the seeds for next year's summer harvest five days before "Frost's Descent". Their specific methods are:

First, arrange four teams so that stubble, labor, tools, and collaboration are coordinated into a complete system, giving full play to their roles.

First, arrange the stubble. Try to clear the stubble as early as possible to ensure timely sowing. After sorting, among the late stubble of the entire commune, there are 17,200 mu of soybean and mung bean stubble and 18,900 mu of spring and summer sweet potato stubble. The bean stubble can be cleared by the end of the month, but early harvesting of sweet potatoes affects yield, and late harvesting affects wheat planting. This is the current prominent contradiction. After detailed analysis and comparison of advantages and disadvantages, everyone believes that this year's sweet potatoes were generally planted earlier than in previous years, and it is reasonable to appropriately advance the early harvest: first, early harvesting and early wheat planting will result in a larger increase in wheat yield than a few more days of sweet potato growth; second, it is convenient for cutting and drying sweet potatoes, increasing the dry rate, and can buy time to avoid autumn rains and reduce drying losses; third, it is convenient to collect and dry-store sweet potato leaves and vines. It was also decided to distinguish between sweet potato planting time and growth conditions, first harvesting spring sweet potatoes, then harvesting early-planted summer sweet potatoes, and then harvesting late sweet potato fields that need to be planted with wheat, completing the harvest before October 15th. This way, harvesting and planting are carried out simultaneously, basically without affecting wheat planting.

Second, arrange labor. Concentrate all available labor into the autumn harvest and planting, fighting a decisive battle. With a lot of late stubble and tight time, harvesting, plowing, and planting are squeezed together. If most of the stubble is cleared but plowing and stubble removal and moisture conservation cannot be done in time, it may not be possible to plant the autumn crops. This requires concentrating superior forces, attacking one item at a time, eating one piece at a time, conducting assembly line operations, and tightly linking each link, achieving one piece harvested, one piece plowed, and one piece planted. Although the entire commune currently has 13,652 laborers, it still cannot meet the needs of the busy season. To meet the needs, it is planned to transfer another 780 people from various units of the commune, and agricultural middle schools, rural junior middle schools, and higher primary schools will be given busy leave, which can add another 2,000 people to support the three autumns. In addition, 80 head of livestock will be organized, with people and cattle working together, so that the needs can be basically met.

Third, arrange tools. Equip all arms of the autumn harvest and planting with weapons, fully improving labor efficiency. The plows, harrows, drills, and harnesses were generally inspected and repaired in the previous period and are basically sufficient. Due to the large increase in labor, the tools are insufficient again. In order to solve this new contradiction, the commune has organized iron and woodworking craftsmen to actively rush production. Currently, 7,100 new hooks and 4,200 iron shovels have been made. There is still a shortage of 2,500 to 3,000 iron shovels, and it is planned to adopt the method of tools not resting while people rest to improve the utilization rate of tools.

Fourth, arrange differences and carry out collaborative support. Among the fifteen production brigades in the entire commune, five production brigades have sufficient labor and livestock; ten brigades need support. The five brigades, including Yi'an, have early stubble and insufficient labor and livestock, and the early stubble cannot be planted early; the five brigades, including Zhoupeng, have strong labor and livestock, but late stubble, resulting in slack at the beginning and tight at the end. These ten brigades adopt the method of exchanging labor for labor at equal value, supporting each other, which can ensure timely sowing of early stubble and early sowing of late stubble.

Second, seize the time, use the troops skillfully, carry out phased assaults, and complete the task in one go.

In terms of time arrangement, be tight in the front and not tight in the back, as early as possible, link each stage tightly, and leave room for maneuver. Arrange eight days of work for ten days. In this way, the plan for the next stage will not be affected in case of rainy weather or leaving a tail. In terms of labor arrangement, conduct specific arrangements, without counting empty accounts, and make full use of it while adapting to people's needs. In terms of labor quotas, revise according to the average quota, so that everyone can exceed the quota. In terms of farm work arrangement, make two plans for sunny and rainy days, and determine the key points according to the climate, soil, and crop varieties. On sunny days, prioritize sandy (land) over silty (land) and low-lying areas over high-lying areas; on rainy days, prioritize silty over sandy and high-lying areas over low-lying areas. The sowing sequence: first sow pure wheat, then sow pea wheat, and finally sow dayuan wheat. Based on these principles, it was decided to fight in three stages to ensure that the harvesting and sowing tasks are completed in one go.

Third, strengthen the leadership of the Party to ensure the success of the autumn harvest and planting from beginning to end.

The following five points are specifically grasped to strengthen leadership:

(1) Implement the policy of both planting more and harvesting more and achieving high yields and harvesting more. The entire commune should use its main strength to effectively manage the large fields, and at the same time spend a certain amount of effort to manage the high-yielding fields and basic fields, using the high-yielding fields and basic fields to guide and drive the large fields. For the more than 10,000 mu of wheat fields with later stubble, adopt the method of mixing chemical fertilizer with seeds (three to five jin per mu) to promote seedling emergence, so that late seedlings can catch up with early seedlings.

(2) Cadres are assigned to fixed points to lead and assign to fixed groups for production. The entire commune extracts five secretaries, five presidents, and five assistants, fixed to fifteen brigades, to be responsible for contracting and sticking to the end. Cadres insist on working in the fields, assigning to fixed groups for production, and receiving equal pay for equal work with commune members, while conducting regular inspections and evaluations.

(3) Implement the three guarantees, adhere to fulfilling promises, and mobilize the production enthusiasm of commune members. Discuss the crop layout for next year and the three guarantees plan among the masses as early as possible. Over-production rewards, adhere to fulfilling promises, and over-production rewards for summer crops will be pre-distributed and pre-rewarded during the summer pre-distribution.

(4) Specific leadership and measures to the field. During the autumn harvest and planting period, the commune and teams will use charts to direct and inspect in stages. Production teams will establish field production signs to promptly announce small-stage plans, indicating when a field will be harvested, when it will be planted, how much labor will be arranged, and who will be responsible for it, all on signs inserted in the field, specific to the person.

(5) Take care of life, with work and rest. During the busy season, ensuring that commune members eat their fill, eat well, and eat in a timely manner is a major issue. It is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the canteens, and at the same time, adhere to the rural work and rest system stipulated by the provincial party committee to ensure that commune members have sufficient rest time.

    地委书记刘锡庚帮助夹河公社修订三秋计划
    茬口劳力和工具配套成龙
    力争秋收秋种适时完成
    本报南京10日电　江苏铜山县夹河人民公社制订“秋收秋种，配套成龙，合理用兵，分段作战”的计划，保证在“霜降”前适时完成秋种任务。
    这个计划是徐州地委第一书记刘锡庚和铜山县委第一书记蒋桂同所领导的工作组，与公社党委书记、大队支部书记、耕作员等反复研究后制订的。
    夹河公社秋收秋种中突出的矛盾就是秋播面积大、要求高、茬口晚、时间紧，收、耕、种挤在一起，安排不好，就会顾此失彼，违误农时。全社秋播面积五万七千亩，比去年扩大三千九百六十亩，其中三麦五万四千亩，要求全部搞小扶?和耩粪，用工量比过去增加两倍。在三麦中，早茬只有一万七千九百亩，这些早茬地，由于秋雨影响，早收没有能够早耕，已耕的部分晒垡地，经过雨淋，土壤板结，也需要再耕一下。其余三万六千一百亩都是大豆、绿豆、山芋（即甘薯）茬，现在还没有腾出来。因此，秋耕比去年推迟半月左右。根据季节，这里三麦播种是“寒露”前后最适宜。在这短短的时间内，要把四万六千亩晚秋收好，把五万七千亩三麦和油菜种好，还要把八千亩秋菜和胡萝卜管好，任务十分艰巨。
    面对这些矛盾，怎么办呢？通过排队算账，全面分析，找到了克服这些矛盾的有利因素，切切实实地解决了秋收秋种中的每一个具体问题，完全有可能在“霜降”前五天播下明年夏季丰收的种子。他们的具体办法是：
    首先，排四个队，使茬口、劳力、工具、协作，配套成龙，充分发挥作用。
    第一，排茬口。尽量争取早腾茬，保证适时播种。经排队，全社晚茬中，大豆、绿豆茬有一万七千二百亩，春夏山芋茬有一万八千九百亩，豆茬月底前可以腾出，但山芋早收影响产量，晚收影响种麦，这是当前突出的矛盾。经过详细分析，对比利害，大家认为，今年山芋一般栽插比往年早，适当提前早收是合理的：一是早收早种麦，麦子早种的增产幅度比山芋多生长几天大；二是便于山芋切晒，提高出干率，而且可以争取时间，避免秋雨，减少晒干损失；三是便于收集和干贮山芋叶藤。并且决定，分别山芋种植时间和生长情况，先收春山芋，后收早栽的夏山芋，再收需要种麦的晚山芋田，10月15日前收完。这样边收边种，基本上不影响种麦。
    第二，排劳力。集中一切可以集中的劳力投入秋收秋种，打歼灭战。在晚茬多、时间紧的情况下，收、耕、种挤在一起，如果大部分茬口腾出后，不能及时抢耕灭茬、保墒，秋种就有种不下去的可能。这就必须集中优势兵力，一项项的攻，一块块的吃，流水作业，环环扣紧，做到收一块、耕一块、种一块，全社目前虽有劳力一万三千六百五十二人，但仍不能适应大忙的需要。为了适应需要，准备再从公社各单位抽调七百八十人，农业中学、农村普中和高小放忙假，还可以增加二千人，支援三秋；另组织牲畜八十犋，人牛一齐上，这样就可以基本上满足需要。
    第三，排工具。使秋收、秋种各兵种人人有武器，充分提高劳动效率。犁、耙、耩、套，前一时期已普遍进行了检查修理，基本上够用。由于劳力大增加，工具又不足了。为了解决这个新的矛盾，公社已组织铁、木工匠积极赶制，现已新制抓钩七千一百把，铁锨四千二百把，还差铁锨二千五百把到三千把，拟采取歇人不歇工具的办法，提高工具利用率。
    第四，排差异，开展协作支援。全社十五个生产大队，有五个生产大队的劳畜力可以自足；有十个大队需要支援。义安等五个大队，茬子早，劳畜力不足，早茬不能早种；周棚等五个大队，劳畜力强，茬子晚，前松后紧。这十个大队采取以工换工，等价交换的办法，互相支援，就能保证早茬适时播种，晚茬提前播种。
    其次，抢时间，巧用兵，分段突击，一气呵成。
    在时间安排上，紧前不紧后，尽早不尽晚，段段扣紧，留有余地。八天活作十天安排。这样，遇有阴雨或留有尾巴不影响下段计划。在劳力安排上，具体排队，不算空账，既充分利用，又因人制宜。在劳动定额上，按照平均定额修订，使大家都能超定额。在农活安排上，晴雨两套打算，根据气候、土壤和作物品种确定重点，晴天先沙（地）后淤（地），先洼后岗；阴天先淤后沙，先岗后洼。播种顺序：先种净小麦，再种豌豆麦，后种大元麦。根据这些原则，决定分三段作战，保证收种任务一气完成。
    第三，加强党的领导，保证秋收秋种善始善终。
    在加强领导上具体抓这样五条：
    （1）贯彻执行多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针。全社以主要力量切实搞好大田，同时花一定的力量搞好丰产田和基本田，以丰产田和基本田指导和带动大田。对一万多亩茬口较晚的麦田，采取用化肥拌种的办法（每亩三至五斤）攻苗提苗，使晚苗赶上早苗。
    （2）干部定点领导，定组生产。全社抽五个书记、五个社长、五个助理员，固定到十五个大队，包干负责，一竿扎到底。干部坚持田头办公，定组生产，与社员同工同酬，同时定期检查评比。
    （3）三包落实，坚持兑现，调动社员的生产积极性。及早在群众中讨论明年作物布局和三包方案。超产奖励，坚持兑现，夏熟作物超产奖励，在夏季预分时预奖。
    （4）领导具体，措施到田。秋收秋种期间，社队挂图指挥，按段检查。生产队建立田头生产牌，及时公布小段计划，对那块田什么时候收，什么时间种，安排多少劳力，由谁负责，都在田头插牌，具体到人。
    （5）搞好生活，有劳有逸。大忙期间，保证社员吃得饱、吃得好、吃得及时是一件大事。必须加强对食堂的领导，同时，坚持执行省委规定的农村作息制度，保证社员有足够的休息时间。
