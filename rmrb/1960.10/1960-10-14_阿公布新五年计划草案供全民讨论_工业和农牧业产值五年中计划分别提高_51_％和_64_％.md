Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, October 12th: Newspapers here published on the 11th the draft directives of the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party (to be held in December) regarding the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) for the development of Albania's economy and culture. The draft stipulates that in the next five years, the output value of industry and agriculture-pastoral activities will increase by 51% and 64% respectively.

    By 1965, the proportion of industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value will reach 53.4%. In this way, Albania will move more rapidly on the road from an agricultural-industrial country to an industrial-agricultural country.

    This draft was formulated by the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and was discussed and approved at the plenary session of the Party Central Committee held from October 7th to 8th. The meeting decided to submit this draft to the working people of the country for discussion.

    The draft states that the Third Five-Year Plan will be an important step forward in establishing a socialist material and technical foundation.

    The draft points out that the Albanian Labor Party believes that further developing the country's socialist industrialization, especially the development of heavy industry, particularly the mining industry, is an important task and the main link in developing other sectors of the national economy. During the Third Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to concentrate all efforts to ensure that the production of grain, edible oils, dairy products, vegetables and potatoes, meat, and other products can be self-sufficient; ensuring the supply of industrial raw materials must become a special task of agricultural organs, governments, and party organs at all levels.

    The draft also points out that it is necessary to strengthen agricultural cooperatives organizationally and economically and improve the material living standards of the working people.

    The draft stipulates that in the new Five-Year Plan, industrial production will increase by an average of 8.6% per year. In the next five years, the production of means of production will increase by 55% (accounting for 49.6% of total production), and the production of consumer goods will increase by at least 48%.

    Taking 1960 as 100, the growth of major industrial products by 1965 is as follows: crude oil - 157, gasoline - 111, coal - 147, chromium - 113, nickel - 192, copper - 237, electricity - 187, cement - 255, wool fabrics - 209, leather shoes - 195, tobacco - 170.

    During the Third Five-Year Plan, geological exploration work will be expanded, and a number of factories will be built and put into operation.

    The draft says that the main task of agriculture during the Third Five-Year Plan is to increase the production of grain, industrial raw materials, vegetables, potatoes, and export products at a faster rate. These tasks must be accomplished by continuing to expand and fully utilize cultivated land, increasing yields per unit area, increasing livestock numbers, and improving productivity. During the five years, the material and technical foundation will be strengthened by further consolidating agricultural cooperatives and state-owned agricultural enterprises economically and organizationally.

    The draft stipulates that compared with 1960, the percentage increase in major agricultural and pastoral products by 1965 is as follows: tobacco - 197, sugar beet - 153, milk - 153, fruits - 172, olives - 282, oranges - 195.

    The draft stipulates that during the five years, the cultivated land area will reach 523,000 hectares, an increase of 14% compared with 1960; 70,000 hectares of land will be reclaimed. Due to water conservancy construction, irrigation capacity will reach 200,100 hectares, an increase of 49% compared with 1960. By 1965, the number of tractors will increase by 119% compared with 1960, and mechanized cultivation will increase by 105%.

    The draft stipulates that the planting of fruit trees will be expanded, and it is estimated that by 1965, the production of various fruits will increase by 72% compared with 1960.

    By 1965, the number of cattle will increase by 24% compared with 1960, sheep - 18%, sows - 43%, and poultry - 67%.

    By 1965, the transportation volume of automobiles, maritime transport, and railways will increase by 39%, 116%, and 95% respectively compared with 1960.

    During the Third Five-Year Plan, Albania will build 400 projects, with a total investment of 70.5 billion lek, an increase of 47% compared with the Second Five-Year Plan.

    The draft says that due to the development of production, the number of employees will increase by 26%. The real wages and income of workers and peasants will increase by 30% and 35% respectively. During the five years, the number of students at all levels will increase by 33%. By 1965, the number of students nationwide will reach 400,000.

    The draft says that during the Third Five-Year Plan, the political and ideological, and cultural education level of the people will be further improved. Marxist-Leninist theory will be widely disseminated, the schools and various cultural and educational institutions will be expanded and strengthened, and the education system will be reorganized to closely link schools with life. On the basis of further developing the productive forces, the alliance between the working class and the working peasants, as well as the economic, political, and organizational foundation of the people's regime, will be further strengthened. The ties between the Party and the masses will be strengthened, the Party, state, and economic organs' methods of economic leadership will be improved, and the technical and professional level of cadres will be improved to adapt to the tasks assigned.
