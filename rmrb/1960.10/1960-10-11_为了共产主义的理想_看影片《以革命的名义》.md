For the Ideal of Communism
——Watching the Film "In the Name of the Revolution"
Sun Wei

	In the years of the great victory of the October Revolution, in the midst of the stormy class struggle, a new generation of revolutionary fighters emerged, the young generation and the youth of the working people, the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. What are the characteristics of this generation, what impact did the revolution have on them, how should they be helped to choose the path forward, and how should they demand of themselves? These are not only issues closely related to this generation itself, but also issues related to the future development of the revolution. The recently completed Chinese film "In the Name of the Revolution" (i.e., the play "Lenin and the Second Generation") gives a very clear answer to these questions.
	The story of "In the Name of the Revolution" takes place in 1918. This was the time when the victorious proletariat was continuing to suppress all counter-revolutionaries and at the same time beginning to establish a new socialist life; but it was also the time when the defeated reactionary forces were unwilling to perish and attempted to sabotage the Soviet regime and the new society by various means, even infiltrating the anti-espionage organs, planning to counterattack from within. The film's depiction of this aspect uses vivid examples to illustrate to us that we must not harbor any illusions about the counter-revolutionaries; the reactionary class will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history.
	In their desperate struggle after defeat, the forces of counter-revolution often also pay attention to the younger generation. They are eager to exploit the youth's yearning for truth and justice, their tendency to sometimes see individual phenomena as the entirety of the problem, their lack of skill in summarizing problems and drawing correct conclusions, etc. In short, they exploit the weaknesses of their lack of social experience to win the youth over to their side and turn them into reactionary tools. After the October Revolution, the reactionaries adopted this kind of insidious means against the youth. Sometimes they use the children's enthusiasm for the revolution to deceive them. The young Vasha really thought they were going to build a "People's Library" and transported books for them several times, but the books were secretly hidden with detonators for explosions. Sometimes they pretend to sympathize with the youth, but in their bones they want to provoke the youth's dissatisfaction with the revolution. When they know that the reactionary forces have become the object of hatred of thousands of people, and that thousands of people, especially the younger generation, have infinite trust and enthusiasm for the revolution, they use clever disguises to cover up their true faces, using double-dealing tactics, on the one hand, full of "freedom," "equality," and "fraternity"; on the other hand, secretly firing cold shots, creating riots and hunger, and even poisoning hundreds of children in nurseries, attempting to use these to stop the progress of the new life. The film gives us great enlightenment in this regard, making us realize that not only must we destroy the counter-revolutionary regime, but also, after the success of the revolution, we must not only be vigilant against the enemy's counter-revolutionary criminal activities such as assassination, poisoning, arson, and creating hunger, but we must also be vigilant against the ideological influence spread by class enemies at all times and prevent their corrosive effect on the younger generation.
	The revolutionary Communists will never allow these plans of the counter-revolutionary forces to be realized. The Bolsheviks believed that it was necessary to immediately launch the work of winning and protecting the younger generation of working people, believing that this new generation was the successor to the great socialist revolutionary cause. As early as 1913, Lenin said: "We have already laid the foundation for the new building, and our children will build it." He hoped that every child of the working people would become a conscious communist, to continue to complete the great revolutionary cause. But this process of growth can only be realized by making the youth invest themselves in the struggle of real life. We should promote the youth's active spirit in the revolutionary struggle and at the same time improve their class consciousness, so that they can gradually acquire the proletarian worldview. Only in this way can they overcome numerous difficulties and continue to move forward in the long-term revolutionary struggle.
	In that fiery era of 1918, the task of protecting, educating, and guiding the younger generation pointed out by Lenin was the task of the entire Party. How to faithfully implement this task is perfectly reflected in Dzerzhinsky, Lenin's comrade-in-arms and student. Dzerzhinsky was an excellent Bolshevik, who had gone through the path of struggle, prison, hard labor, and exile, and was a tenacious and indomitable revolutionary fighter. In 1918, he was leading the work of the All-Russian Anti-Espionage Commission, and the Anti-Espionage Commission was also responsible for settling children. Therefore, in this film, Lenin said: "The proletariat's sword of punishing counter-revolutionaries has played the role of protecting children,... this is the logic of our lives!" Here we see the vivid and glorious spiritual outlook of Dzerzhinsky, the Party's faithful son. His body combines infinite hatred for counter-revolutionaries and infinite love for the younger generation of working people. We also saw his strong will. All of this is as Stalin said in his eulogy after his death: "Now standing before the coffin, recalling the entire journey experienced by Comrade Dzerzhinsky... I would like to use two words to describe his boiling life: burning... Without rest, without fear of hardship, bravely fighting against difficulties, overcoming difficulties, and dedicating all his strength and all his energy to the cause entrusted to him by the Party - for the interests of the proletariat, for the victory of communism, he burned out in his work."
	The younger generation of working people did not fail the expectations of the revolutionary mentors of the previous generation. In them, the passion of youth is combined with the characteristics of the class. They bravely participate in the proletarian revolutionary struggle, strive to stand at the forefront of this struggle, and grow and become stronger quickly in the struggle. They demand each other with extremely strict attitudes to obey the interests of the revolution. They demand that they become people with a high degree of communist ideological awareness. They are willing to sacrifice for the revolution. The poem written by Yashka in the film and dedicated to Lenin expresses their common noble feelings: "He has joined the war, with fearless eyes. His comrade's rifle is tightly held in his heart. He is tenacious and unyielding, does not complain, does not resent, and fulfills his sacred duty very piously." And it was the great example of Lenin, the revolutionary leader of the working people, who directly encouraged and educated them.
	After watching this film "In the Name of the Revolution," which has a high educational significance, looking back at the touching past of forty years ago, and looking back at the struggle carried out by the pioneers to create a new society, we feel that we should, as Lenin said in the film: often demand ourselves in the name of the revolution to think about the past, think about how the happiness and achievements of today's socialist society came about, remember those revolutionaries who once created a new history for mankind, remember the revolutionary successors who grew up in hunger and war and threw themselves into the struggle, remember their spirit of bravely advancing and self-sacrifice. Forgetting these, being satisfied with the status quo, and losing the spirit of revolutionary struggle is a betrayal of the revolutionary cause. At the same time, we should, as Dzerzhinsky said, demand that our children "grasp something more valuable, something that is greater and more powerful than their feelings for their parents and relatives. Our children must have the ideal of communism, which can give them strength and illuminate their lives. Only when a person lives for the ideal of communism can he feel true happiness."
	Thinking about the past in the name of the revolution is not for anything else, mainly to: illuminate our future with the ideal of communism, and use unparalleled revolutionary determination and a high degree of Marxist-Leninist thought to guide the current struggle and to meet the grand future!

    为了共产主义的理想
    ——看影片《以革命的名义》
    孙玮
    在伟大的十月革命胜利的年代里，在狂风暴雨般的阶级斗争中，出现了革命战士的新的一代，劳动人民的青年和少年一代，无产阶级革命事业的接班人。这一代人有什么特点，革命给了他们什么影响，应当怎样帮助他们选择前进的道路，他们自己应当怎样要求自己，这不但是与这一代人本身有密切关系的问题，而且也是关系到革命的发展前途的问题。我国最近摄制完成的影片《以革命的名义》（即话剧《列宁与第二代》），对这些问题给了很明确的回答。
    《以革命的名义》的故事发生在1918年。这正是胜利了的无产阶级一面继续镇压一切反革命分子，一面着手建立新的社会主义生活的时候；但也是被打倒的反动势力不甘心灭亡，企图用种种方法破坏苏维埃政权，破坏新社会，甚至钻进肃反机关，打算从内部进行反攻的时候。影片中关于这方面的描写，用鲜明的例子向我们说明，对反革命不能抱任何幻想，反动的阶级不会自动地退出历史舞台。
    反革命的势力在失败后的疯狂的挣扎中，常常也注意到青年一代，他们很想利用青年们对真理与正义的向往，利用他们有时把个别现象看成问题的全部，利用青年们不善于归纳问题作出正确的结论等等倾向，总之，利用他们缺乏社会经验的弱点把青年们争夺到自己手里，变成反动派的反动工具。十月革命后，反动派对青年们采取的就是这一类阴险手段。有时他们利用孩子们对革命的热情进行欺骗，少年瓦夏就真以为他们要建立什么“人民图书馆”，为他们运了几次书，而书中却暗藏着爆炸用的雷管。他们有时又伪装出同情青年的模样，骨子里却是想挑起青年们对革命的不满。当他们知道反动势力已成为千万人民憎恨的对象，知道千万人民，特别是青年一代，对革命怀着无限的信任与热情的时候，他们就用巧妙的装扮遮掩起自己的真面目，使用两面派的手法，一面满口“自由”呀，“平等”呀，“博爱”呀；一面却暗放冷枪，制造暴乱与饥饿，甚至毒死保育院的成百的孩子，企图用这些阻止新生活的前进。影片在这方面给了我们很大的启发，使我们认识到不但要摧毁反革命的政权，而且在革命成功后，不仅要警惕敌人暗杀、放毒、放火、制造饥饿等等反革命罪恶活动，还必须随时警惕阶级敌人散布的思想影响，防止他们对青年一代的腐蚀作用。
    革命的共产党人决不允许反革命势力的这些计划得以实现。布尔什维克认为必须立即展开争取和保护劳动人民的青年一代的工作，认为这新的一代是伟大的社会主义革命事业的接班人。列宁早在1913年就说过：“我们已经为新的大厦奠定了基础，我们的子女将要把它建成。”他希望劳动人民的每一个孩子都成为自觉的共产主义者，去继续完成伟大的革命事业。但是这种成长的过程只有使青年们投入现实生活的斗争中才能实现。应当在革命斗争中一面发扬青年们的积极精神，一面提高他们的阶级觉悟，使他们逐渐获得无产阶级世界观。只有这样，他们才能在长期的革命斗争中克服重重困难，不断前进。
    在1918年那个火热的年代里，列宁所指出的这项保护、教育和引导年轻一代的任务，是全党的任务。如何忠实地贯彻这个任务，很完美地在列宁的战友和学生捷尔任斯基身上体现出来。捷尔任斯基是一个优秀的布尔什维克，他曾经过了斗争、牢狱、苦役、流放的道路，是一个艰苦卓绝、不屈不挠的革命战士。1918年他正在领导全俄肃反委员会的工作，而肃反委员会同时也负起了安顿儿童的任务。因此，在这部影片中，列宁才说：“无产阶级惩治反革命的宝剑起了保护孩子的作用，……这就是我们生活的逻辑！”我们在这里看到了党的忠实的儿子捷尔任斯基的生动而光辉的精神面貌。他的身上结合着对反革命分子的无限憎恨与对劳动人民的年轻一代的无限热爱。我们也看见了他那种坚强的意志。这一切正如斯大林在他去世后的悼词里说的那样：“现在伫立灵前，回忆捷尔任斯基同志所经历的全部路程……就想用两个字来形容他这沸腾的一生：燃烧。……不知休息，不辞劳苦，勇敢地和困难作斗争，克服困难，把全部气力、全部精力献给党所托付给他的事业——为了无产阶级的利益，为了共产主义的胜利，他在工作中燃烧尽了。”
    劳动人民的年轻一代也没有辜负前一代革命导师的期望。在他们身上，青春的热情是同阶级的特性结合在一起的，他们勇敢地参加无产阶级的革命斗争，争取在这个斗争中站在前列，而且在斗争中很快地成长与壮大起来了。他们彼此以极严格的态度要求服从革命的利益，他们要求自己成为具有共产主义的高度思想觉悟的人，他们甘愿为革命牺牲。影片中的亚什卡最后写的那首献给列宁的诗，表达了他们的共同的高尚感情：“他已投入战争，带着无畏的眼神。战友的步枪紧握在他的手心。他坚韧顽强，不诉苦，不怨恨，十分虔诚地完成他那神圣的天职。”而直接鼓舞和教育了他们的，正是劳动人民的革命领袖列宁这个伟大的榜样。
    看完了《以革命的名义》这部有很高的教育意义的影片，回顾四十年前动人的往事，回顾先驱者为缔造新社会而进行的斗争，使我们感到，我们应当像影片中的列宁所说的那样：时常以革命的名义要求自己想想过去，想想今天的社会主义社会的幸福与成就是怎样得来的，记着那些曾经创造了人类的新历史的革命者，记着那在饥饿与战争中成长起来，奋不顾身地投入斗争的革命接班人，记着他们的勇往直前和自我牺牲的精神。忘记了这些，满足于现状，丧失革命斗争精神，那就是对革命事业的背叛。同时也应当像捷尔任斯基说的那样，要求我们的孩子们“掌握另一种更加宝贵的东西，这种东西要比他们对父母、对亲友的情感更伟大，更有力量，我们的孩子们一定要有共产主义的理想，这才能够给他们力量，照亮他们的一生。一个人只有当他为共产主义的理想而活着，他才可能感到真正的幸福。”
    以革命的名义想想过去，不是为了别的，主要的在于：以共产主义的理想去照亮我们的前程，用无比的革命坚定性，高度的马克思列宁主义的思想，去指导当前的斗争，去迎接远大的未来！
