Xinhua News Agency, October 28th, Washington Dispatch: The US presidential election campaign has entered its most intense stage. Kennedy, the Democratic presidential candidate, and Nixon, the Republican presidential candidate, who were selected by the US monopoly capital groups to play the farce of American bourgeois "democracy", have been busily campaigning across the United States recently in order to compete for the position of US president. They travel hundreds of kilometers every day by plane, train, and car, shaking hands with people, and giving dozens of campaign speeches with all their might, engaging in fierce mutual attacks and clamoring over the failures and dead ends of US domestic and foreign policies.

Kennedy visited nearly twenty places in one day on the 25th, delivering as many as ten campaign speeches. Nixon braved the rain on the 26th in Ohio to deliver multiple campaign speeches to voters and prepared to campaign in New York with Eisenhower. American bourgeois newspapers publish a large number of sensational and vivid reports every day, using this to promote American bourgeois "democracy" and deceive the broad masses of American voters.

This year's election campaign between the Democratic and Republican parties is being conducted under circumstances in which the domestic and international situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable to the US ruling groups. Since the last US presidential election four years ago, the situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind has become increasingly prominent internationally. The aggressive foreign policy of the United States has repeatedly failed. The "sham peace" conspiracy recently played by the US government has also been further exposed and bankrupted in its frantic arms expansion and war preparations. Domestically, the United States is facing a new economic crisis this year, not long after barely surviving the economic crisis of 1957-1958. Therefore, it is even more difficult for the Republican Party to use the deceptive slogans of "peace and prosperity" for the campaign this year as it did in the past. However, a series of statements by the two parties' candidates show that they not only have absolutely no intention of changing the failed US foreign aggression and expansion policy of so-called "strength," but also want to pursue this policy even more frantically. "The Wall Street Journal" pointed out in a commentary on the 21st that now American voters "eight out of ten believe that the issue of war and peace is the most important issue in the election," but "they cannot see any actual 'dispute' between the two candidates on this issue" because "both candidates are firmly anti-communist, guaranteeing to be tough on the Soviet Union... and have never put forward any dramatic ways to break the Cold War stalemate."

Kennedy, taking advantage of his position as an opposition party candidate, constantly attacked the Republican Party in the campaign for causing "America's prestige to decline unprecedentedly." He repeatedly accused the Eisenhower administration of making the United States' strength in "military, political, psychological, scientific, and industrial" aspects "continuously deteriorate" compared with the Soviet Union during its eight years in power. He said that he "looked up into the sky and saw the Soviet flag planted on the moon." Kennedy also attacked the failure of the US policy toward China on several occasions, citing the fact that this session of the United Nations General Assembly had an "unprecedentedly large" number of countries supporting the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. He said with trepidation that the China issue is a "problem that most directly affects the strength, prestige, and influence of the United States." He indicated that the United States should step up its policy of hostility toward China and create "two Chinas." Kennedy clamored to "reverse" the situation unfavorable to the United States. He emphasized that "the main issue for us is to oppose communism." To this end, he proposed a plan for the United States to step up arms expansion and war preparations, stipulating that the United States should strengthen its "nuclear strike force," "accelerate the implementation of special programs to enable the United States to obtain the latest weapons to overcome the lag in missiles," and "modernize and mobilize conventional forces." He emphasized that a "strong America" is a "goal above all else."

While advocating active preparation for military strength, Kennedy also advocated engaging in subversive activities against socialist countries. He attacked the Republican Party's bankrupt "liberation" policy as "disappointing empty promises" and said that the United States should "pursue a policy of patiently encouraging freedom" and "expect evolution" through "cultural exchange."

Nixon denied that American prestige had been swept away, and he boasted that the current American prestige is "unprecedentedly high rather than unprecedentedly low." But he also emphasized that the United States must strengthen its "strength." He said that "no matter the cost," it must be guaranteed that the United States is "the strongest country" militarily. The overriding consideration for the United States is to "expand freedom to the whole world." He advocated that the United States should "make new efforts and launch an all-out offensive" in promoting aggression and war policies, and put forward a corresponding program to step up arms expansion and war preparations.

Nixon and Kennedy also expressed deep-seated hatred for the vigorously rising national independence movement. During the "television debate" with Nixon, Kennedy advocated that the United States should take further measures to threaten Cuba. He clamored that the US "trade embargo" against Cuba was still "not enough," that the United States should strive for "other countries in the Western Hemisphere and European allies to support the US embargo against Cuba," that the United States should confiscate Cuban assets in the United States, and "strengthen" the Cuban counter-revolutionary forces that "hope to overthrow the Castro regime." Nixon bluntly said that the US government was pursuing the method of "overthrowing former Guatemalan President Arbenz" against Cuba. The United States should "overthrow the Castro regime" by "cutting off trade and diplomatic relations" and other means. Kennedy and Nixon also echoed each other in advocating the use of the United Nations as a "central tool" and using "aid" as a bait to step up expansion and aggression in vast areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

On domestic issues, Kennedy fiercely attacked the Republican government on the issue of the US economic crisis. He pointed out that in the first nine months of this year, the US economy declined, and "declined more than any (Western) power." He estimated that at least "seventeen million people in the United States are going to bed hungry" at present. Kennedy advocated that the United States should greatly increase government spending, especially military spending, to stimulate the economy. Nixon also agreed to take measures such as increasing government spending, and he and Kennedy jointly stated that in order to cope with the increase in government spending caused by further arms expansion and war preparations and the adoption of "anti-crisis measures," they advocated further "tax increases." On the issue of racial discrimination, Kennedy attacked the Eisenhower administration for "failing to lead the implementation" of the Supreme Court's 1954 ruling on abolishing racial segregation in schools. Nixon retorted. He said that Kennedy's personally selected Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Senate Democratic leader Johnson, is precisely a person who has consistently opposed the passage of "civil rights legislation."

According to reports, because neither party's candidates have put forward any programs that truly reflect the will of the people, American voters are very indifferent to the election. In some so-called "opinion polls," many voters refused to express their opinions on the question of "who do you like." An Associated Press report on the 25th said that American voters "greatly lack enthusiasm for either candidate." The US government recently estimated that by the time of the formal vote on November 8, the number of people participating in the vote will only account for about 60% of eligible citizens.

    美国竞选丑态多　两套班子一路货
    尼克松肯尼迪相互攻击一致鼓吹加强“实力”推行侵略政策
    美联社说美国选民对任何一个候选人都“大大缺乏热心”
    新华社28日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统竞选运动已经进入最紧张的阶段。被美国垄断资本集团挑选出来扮演美国资产阶级假“民主”丑剧的民主党总统候选人肯尼迪和共和党总统候选人尼克松，为了角逐美国总统的职位，最近一直忙碌地在美国各地进行竞选旅行。他们每天乘坐飞机、火车、汽车走上数百公里，同人们握手言欢，声嘶力竭地发表成十篇的竞选演说，就美国内政外交政策的失败和走投无路展开激烈的相互攻讦和吵嚷。
    肯尼迪在25日一天就到了差不多二十个地方，发表了多达十篇的竞选演说，尼克松在26日也冒雨在俄亥俄州对选民发表多次竞选谈话，并且准备和艾森豪威尔一道到纽约拉票。美国资产阶级报刊天天都发表大量耸人听闻、绘形绘色的报道，借此宣扬美国资产阶级“民主”，欺骗美国广大选民。
    民主党和共和党今年的竞选运动是在国内外形势对美国统治集团越来越不利的情况下进行的。自从四年前上一次美国总统选举以来，国际上东风压倒西风的形势越来越显著。美国的侵略性外交政策不断遭到失败。美国政府最近玩弄的“假和平”阴谋也在它疯狂的扩军备战活动中进一步暴露和破产。在国内方面，美国在勉强挨过了1957年—1958年的经济危机以后不久，今年又面临新的经济危机。因此共和党今年要像过去那样，再利用“和平与繁荣”的欺骗性口号进行竞选已更加困难。但是，两党候选人的一连串言论表明，他们不仅绝对无意改变美国失败了的所谓从“实力地位出发”的对外侵略和扩张政策，而且要更加疯狂地奉行这种政策。“华尔街日报”21日在一篇评论中就指出，现在美国的选民“十个有八个认为战争与和平的问题是选举中的最重要的问题”，但是“他们在两个候选人中看不出他们在这个问题上实际上有什么‘争论’”，因为“两个候选人都坚决反共，保证要对苏联强硬，……并且从没有提出任何打破冷战僵局的戏剧性办法”。
    肯尼迪利用他在野党候选人的有利地位，在竞选中不断攻击共和党使“美国的威信空前低落”。他一再指责艾森豪威尔政府执政八年使美国在“军事、政治、心理、科学和工业”等方面的力量同苏联相比“一直恶化”。他说，他“抬头往上空看，就望见苏联的国旗插在月球上”。肯尼迪还以本届联合国大会有“空前多”的国家支持恢复中国在联合国的合法席位一事，多次攻击美国对华政策的失败。他惶恐地说，中国问题是一个“最直接地影响美国的力量、威信和影响的问题”。他表示美国要加紧推行敌视中国、制造“两个中国”的政策。肯尼迪叫嚷要“扭转”不利于美国的形势。他强调说，“对我们来说，主要的问题是反对共产主义”。为此他提出一个美国加紧扩军备战的计划，规定要加强美国的“核攻击力量”，“加速推行特殊计划使美国得到最新的武器来克服在导弹方面的落后”以及“使常规部队现代化和具有机动性”。他强调说，一个“强大的美国”是“超乎一切之上的目标”。
    在鼓吹积极准备军事力量的同时，肯尼迪还主张要对社会主义国家搞颠复活动。他攻击共和党人破了产的“解放”政策是“令人沮丧的空洞诺言”，并且说美国要“奉行一种耐心地鼓励自由”和通过“文化交流”来“期望演变”的政策。
    尼克松否认美国威信扫地，他吹嘘目前美国的威信是“空前高而不是空前低”。但是他同样强调，美国必须加强它的“实力”。他说，“不论代价如何”，必须保证美国在军事上是“最强大的国家”。美国驾凌一切的考虑是“把自由扩大到全世界”。他鼓吹美国在推行侵略和战争政策方面要“进行新的努力和发动全面攻势”，并且提出了相应的加紧扩军备战纲领。
    尼克松和肯尼迪对于蓬勃高涨的民族独立运动也同样表示刻骨的仇视。肯尼迪在同尼克松进行“电视辩论”时鼓吹美国要进一步采取措施来威胁古巴。他叫嚷，美国对古巴实行“贸易禁运”还是“不够”的，美国要争取“西半球的其他国家和欧洲盟国支持美国对古巴的禁运”，美国要没收古巴在美国的资产，并且“加强”所谓“有希望推翻卡斯特罗政权”的古巴反革命势力。尼克松则露骨地说，美国政府对古巴正在推行“推翻前危地马拉总统阿本斯”的手法。美国要“通过切断贸易和外交关系”等办法来“推翻卡斯特罗政权”。肯尼迪和尼克松还异口同声地主张要以联合国作为“中心工具”，以“援助”为诱饵加紧向亚非和拉丁美洲的广大地区进行扩张和侵略。
    在国内问题上，肯尼迪就美国经济危机问题猛烈攻击共和党政府。他指出，今年头九个月，美国经济下降了，而且“比任何（西方）大国都下降得多”。他估计美国目前至少有“一千七百万人是饿着肚皮上床睡觉的”。肯尼迪鼓吹美国要大量增加政府开支、特别是军事开支来刺激经济。尼克松也同意采取增加政府开支等办法，他并且和肯尼迪一起声言，为了应付由于进一步扩军备战和采取“反危机措施”而引起的政府开支的增加，他们主张进一步“增税”。在种族歧视的问题上，肯尼迪攻击艾森豪威尔政府“没有领导执行”最高法院在1954年作出的关于取消学校中的种族隔离制度的规定。尼克松则反唇相讥。他说，肯尼迪亲自挑选的民主党副总统候选人、参议院民主党领袖约翰逊正是一个一贯反对通过“民权立法”的人。
    据报道，由于两党的候选人都没有提出任何真正反映人民意愿的纲领，美国选民对选举很冷淡。在一些所谓“民意调查”中，许多选民都拒绝对“你欢喜谁”这个问题表示意见。美联社25日消息说，美国选民“对任何一个候选人都大大缺乏热心”。美国政府最近估计，到11月8日正式投票时，参加投票的人大约将只占适龄公民的60％。
