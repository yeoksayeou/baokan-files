    Mad Anti-Marxists and Lackeys of Warmongers
    --A Brief Discussion of Kardelj's "Socialism and War"
    Albania  Yusuf Alibali Alfred Uchi
    The Yugoslav propaganda machine is clamoring about Kardelj's new book "Socialism and War." Western reactionary groups and reformist groups are shouting that this book is a new contribution against communism and progressive forces. The title itself, the structure of the chapters, and especially the content of the whole book all show that Kardelj, who is considered one of the main theorists of modern revisionism, representing and under the orders of the Belgrade Tito group, has set very specific and malicious predetermined goals for himself.

    It is no coincidence that Kardelj's "work" appears precisely at this moment. Aggressive U.S. imperialist warmongers are further poisoning the international situation, paralyzing the peace-loving forces of the world, and splitting the unity of the international communist movement and socialist countries. Kardelj's approach is an inseparable part of these new movements launched by U.S. imperialism. This is the real purpose of Kardelj's "work," and the debate with the Chinese Communists is merely a pretext to conceal this purpose. In fact, attacking the Chinese Communists is attacking Marxism-Leninism. Because the Chinese Communist Party has always stood on the correct ideological position in the past and present, and has always unswervingly defended Marxism-Leninism.

    Yugoslav revisionists want to use this new "work" to attack, distort, and subvert the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism in order to maintain the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism. This is a last-ditch attempt to distort and infiltrate Marxist terminology from the standpoint of bourgeois ideology, to talk about the main problems of the current international situation, the Leninist policy of peaceful coexistence, socialist construction, and the relations between socialist camp countries, thereby vigorously beautifying imperialism. Thus, Yugoslav revisionists, under the guise of being "admirers and protectors" of Marxism-Leninism, are dressing themselves up as people who oppose dogmatism and sectarianism. But in reality, they are still apologists for aggressive U.S. imperialism, doing their utmost to fire their poisonous arrows at the invincible ideology of Marxism-Leninism, at socialism and communism, at the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and at peace and understanding between nations.
    I

    The tricks used by the revisionist Kardelj in his article are typical, and are commonly used by enemies of Marxism-Leninism, traitors to the communist and workers' movement, and apologists for the bourgeoisie and imperialism. The author makes extensive use of political deception and sophistry, wantonly distorting the ideas of the Marxist-Leninist classic writers and the Chinese Communists, or fabricating non-existent arguments and views, which are then overturned or used to benefit his own position depending on the circumstances.

    For the U.S. leadership group, the biggest "bad thing" at present is the unity of the socialist countries and the resolute struggle of the people of all countries for peace and against the aggressive policies of the U.S. imperialists. They hope to "remedy" this "bad thing," and are also throwing the Yugoslav revisionists into the offensive. Kardelj's recent "work" proves this.

    Kardelj forges the basic principles of the most important questions of Marxist science, and he attacks the famous Marxist-Leninist thesis that the root of war is the nature and essence of the exploitation system. Kardelj writes: "The inevitability of war has never been absolute, destined. It has always depended on the balance of power." This argument by Kardelj fundamentally revises the Marxist-Leninist view of the origin and essence of war, and denies that war has ever been inevitable for all exploiting societies.

    Marxism-Leninism teaches that war as a historical category has class content, is a product of antagonistic exploitation systems, is a product of antagonistic contradictions between classes and countries in these societies, and is a continuation of their policies by other means, precisely by violent means. The revisionist Kardelj tries his best to portray the Marxist-Leninist classic writers as bourgeois pacifists, adding vague ideas, saying that "war is an obstacle to the development of internal revolutionary movements and internal processes of society."

    Communists have always emphasized the principled distinction between them and bourgeois pacifists. Communists divide wars into just and unjust wars. The Marxist-Leninist classic writers concluded from this distinction that the revolutionary movement must be seen as positive, that only just wars are progressive, and that unjust wars of imperialist plunder and aggression are reactionary. Lenin wrote: Unlike bourgeois pacifists, "we understand the inevitable connection between wars and the internal class struggle, we understand that wars cannot be eliminated without eliminating classes and establishing socialism, and we fully recognize the rationality, progressiveness, and inevitability of civil war, that is, the war of the oppressed classes against the oppressing classes..." (Complete Works of Lenin, Chinese Edition, Vol. 21, p. 279) Kardelj, the fabricator, insists that the founders of Marxism-Leninism "never" linked the avoidability of war "with any specific date in history, but only with the maturity of a series of material and ideological factors that will determine people's actions in social development." In fact, Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin have always linked the elimination of war with "a fixed day in history," precisely with the "day" of overthrowing capitalism worldwide and building socialism. But they did not believe that various wars could be avoided under the rule of capitalism, and all the changes that occurred in the era of Marx, Engels, and Lenin occurred within the capitalist system, and were changes in the balance of power among capitalist countries. As Lenin said, these changes can only lead to one result, that is, to the division of the world into hostile groups of imperialist countries, and the antagonistic contradictions of these groups create imperialist wars of plunder. Therefore, Lenin emphasized: Under such circumstances, it is impossible to bury bayonets in the ground and end the war by relying on the rhetoric of pacifist passionate dreams, but must oppose the imperialist bourgeoisie through civil war, through the revolutionary war of the workers.

    For Kardelj, avoiding war is the result of a change in the nature of imperialism. According to him, imperialism has not changed since Lenin's time, only one aspect, only the appearance, or as he himself said, the moral or ethical aspect, but he believes that the nature of imperialism has undergone a fundamental change. Now, for Kardelj, imperialism is no longer aggressive and is unable to wage wars of enslavement and aggression.

    Is it necessary to cite a fact to prove how much the aggressive nature of imperialism has changed? The imperialists are the creators of the intensification of the international situation after World War II, they are the creators of the "Cold War" and the "position of strength" policy, and they have established aggressive military blocs such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Central Treaty Organization. They launched wars of aggression in Korea, Vietnam, Egypt, Algeria, and other places. They threatened Syria and Iraq with war, and their troops landed in Lebanon and occupied Taiwan. They continue the arms race and oppose the ban on atomic weapons and complete disarmament. They sabotaged summit meetings, sent spy planes to violate the sovereignty of the Soviet Union, and carried out provocations against socialist countries.

    The imperialists' aggressive activities and actions are endless, and only the Yugoslav revisionists are trying their best to reduce and mitigate them.

    Kardelj's argument cannot but remind people of Kautsky's notorious theory of "ultra-imperialism." When the contradictions of imperialist countries were at their peak during World War I, Kautsky declared that a "new" era, an era of "peaceful imperialism," had begun. Lenin's position on this theory is well known. Lenin believed that this theory was a means of covering up the social chauvinism of the heads of the opportunist Second International and a means of spreading bourgeois pacifist illusions among the masses. The Yugoslav revisionists are reviving this theory by putting on the current fashionable clothes for Kautsky's theory. It is no coincidence that the "Combat Daily" of December 4, 1959, described Eisenhower, one of the main representatives of U.S. imperialism, as "the founder of the cause of eliminating the Cold War, consolidating lasting peace, and peaceful competition between different political systems." While emphasizing Tito's "mildness" regarding the argument that "modernized technology has made the struggle for peace a reality," Kardelj supports the monopoly trust's arms race policy and repeats the appalling and neurotic "theory" of the Pentagon and the generals of the Federal Defence Force, saying that atomic and hydrogen bombs in the hands of imperialists seem to be a "deterrent force" in defending peace. This is why Kardelj's book is a genuine praise of aggressive imperialism, the arms race, and militarism. This is how Kardelj vilely slanders the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, distorts their position on major issues, and praises imperialism. Kardelj plays with Marxism-Leninism, widely attacks the Chinese Communist Party, and openly promotes his own revisionist and anti-Marxist views.

    To conceal the aggressive nature of contemporary imperialism, to protect the real persons responsible for wars of aggression, to paralyze the peace-loving forces, and to attack and distort the invincible ideology of Marxism-Leninism -- this is the purpose of Kardelj's "clumsy theory." Therefore, his article has received the cheers and understanding of all the current reactionary forces headed by the U.S. leadership group.
    II

    Socialism and capitalism are two completely opposite social systems, and the essential difference between socialism and capitalism is also manifested in the issue of war and peace. It is a fundamental truth that socialism, as a social system, can never be reconciled with wars of plunder, that socialism advocates peace, while capitalism advocates aggressive wars. But the revisionists' duty as lackeys of imperialism makes them deny even this fundamental truth. When talking about the socialist camp, Kardelj always deliberately portrays it as a "military unit," a "man-made military organization," a "military group" similar to imperialist aggressive military blocs. This revisionist fabrication has its own "logic." Making this fabrication is intended, on the one hand, to portray the imperialist countries as "defending against aggression," and on the other hand, to shift the responsibility for intensifying the international situation, the arms race, the "Cold War," and "hot war" to the socialist camp.

    For Kardelj, the socialist camp and socialist countries are not only not positive and decisive factors in defending peace, but on the contrary, in his view, "the socialist camp and socialist countries are negative factors in this regard." Kardelj shamelessly declares that the danger of war comes from socialism, that aggressive and unjust wars are not incompatible with socialism as a socio-economic system. The rulers in Washington enthusiastically applaud this statement and pay millions of dollars for it. Kardelj fabricates that "the Marxist classic writers did not exclude the possibility of a socialist country also waging unjust wars."

    Marx, as a revolutionary and true scientist, proved that capitalism and socialism are also two opposite social types on the issue of war and peace, emphasizing that capitalism is linked to war, to "political dislocation," while socialism is linked to peace. Marx wrote: "...In contrast to that old society with its economic poverty and political darkness, a new society is being born, and the international principle of this new society will be peace, because every nation will be equally ruled by labor!" (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Two-Volume Edition, Volume 1, p. 469) Lenin's writings never failed to mention that only socialism can guarantee peace to mankind. However, Kardelj openly violates historical reality and desperately "theorizes" that aggressive wars do not seem to be incompatible with socialism. He writes: "No socialist country will automatically acquire immunity from aggressive activities simply because it is socialist." In reality, precisely because our countries are socialist, even any tendency towards aggression is incompatible with us.

    Socialism does not need war. In socialist society, there are no forces keen on the arms race, keen on militarization, and keen on wars of aggression. The people and parties of our countries are fighting to build a communist society in which there will be universal welfare, national prosperity, and lasting peace among all nations. Socialist countries need lasting peace in order to build such a society. Therefore, socialist countries follow a consistent policy of peace and oppose the aggressive policies of imperialism.

    However, Kardelj's "theoretical" exercise is nothing more than a repetition of the bourgeois propaganda concerning "communist danger" and "export of revolution" in the guise of "socialist" phrases. Who else today is trying to shout "communist danger," shouting that someone is "exporting" revolution to Cuba, the Congo, and the world, besides bourgeois thinkers, imperialist propagandists -- all kinds of Nixons, Herto, Harrimans, Kennedys, Rockefellers, and the like -- besides the known and unknown enemies of communism? Besides the imperialist hawkers, who else is so crazy as to accuse the Soviet Union and People's China of aggression and occupation? The Tito revisionist group, which also includes "socialist" Kardelj, the active defender of the failed cause of capitalism, has in the past and present shouted itself hoarse, precisely participating in this cowardly and short-sighted chorus of capitalists. In reality, this is an imagined "danger," because the idea of "exporting revolution" is incompatible with Marxism-Leninism and with countries of the socialist type.

    The starting point of all communist parties is Lenin's point: "Revolution cannot be carried out according to order forms and agreements. Revolution will only break out when millions upon millions of people believe that they can no longer live like this." (Complete Works of Lenin, Chinese Edition, Vol. 27, p. 449) Communists are convinced that socialism will inevitably triumph throughout the world. The Yugoslav revisionists are forced to admit that war can be avoided and that lasting peace can be established, but they try every means to cover up the true path to achieving peace and avoiding war. Their spokesman Kardelj does not admit that the "change in the balance of power" that he sings about is primarily and directly related to the formation of the world socialist system. The communists talk about the possibility of avoiding a world war not from the argument promoted by the Yugoslav revisionists that imperialism is no longer aggressive, but from the new balance of international forces in favor of socialism and peace. Today, a devastating world war can be avoided because there is a powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union -- an indestructible fortress of peace, the main obstacle to imperialism's realization of its aggressive conspiracies. The socialist camp possesses the economic power and modern weapons that can restrain the aggressors. Once they launch an aggressive world war, they will be completely eliminated, and the cause of peace is also defended by all those countries that make up the so-called peace zone . The collapse of the imperialist colonial system, the expansion and consolidation of the international communist and workers' movements, the growth of the peace movement in the capitalist world, imperialism's isolation among the people, various anti-imperialist movements, and many other factors have changed the balance of power in favor of socialism, making it possible to avoid a world war. But as long as imperialism still exists, there is another possibility -- the possibility of the imperialists launching a war. The realization of this or that possibility does not happen as naturally as the revisionists say, but depends on the struggle between the forces of peace and the forces for war. Therefore, the existence of the world socialist system, the unity of the socialist countries, and the maximum mobilization of the world's peace-loving forces have become the decisive factors in protecting mankind from the danger of a devastating war. The international imperialist forces headed by the United States are frantically launching an offensive against these factors, and are using the Pentagon and Allen Dulles's agencies, United Nations personnel and colonialist forces, Bonn militarists and Belgrade revisionists to achieve their sinister intentions. In this respect, Lenin's teachings are still of great practical significance today. He wrote decades ago: "Whoever thinks that peace can be easily achieved, whoever thinks that as long as we mention peace, the bourgeoisie will bring peace to us on a plate, is a very naive person." (Complete Works of Lenin, Chinese Edition, Vol. 26, p. 323) The historical Moscow Declaration also announced Lenin's idea that it is necessary to unite the people of all countries to carry out a long-term, unremitting, and unwavering struggle, to strive for peace, and to oppose imperialist aggressors. The declaration said: "The union of these powerful forces can prevent the outbreak of war. If the imperialist warmongers insist on launching a war at all costs, then imperialism is doomed to perish. Because the people will never continue to tolerate the system that brings them such heavy suffering and sacrifice."
    III

    As everyone knows, the Leninist policy of peaceful coexistence is the general line of the foreign policy of socialist countries. This policy is embodied in historical documents such as the Moscow Declaration of November 1957, and is embodied in the daily practice of every socialist country. This policy means that international relations between countries with different social and political systems are developed and expanded on the basis of strict respect for sovereignty, national independence, mutually beneficial policies in economic relations, complete equality, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. The current foreign policy of the countries of the socialist camp follows these basic principles, and there are countless examples of this. For example, the Soviet Union and People's China, in their relations with countries that not only have different social and political structures, but also have different economic conditions and international positions, such as Finland and Austria, India and the United Arab Republic, Guinea and Cuba, Nepal and Afghanistan, Cambodia and Indonesia, follow the Leninist policy of peaceful coexistence.

    All honest and peace-loving people in the world have now recognized that the implementation of this Leninist policy is a valuable and very important contribution of the countries of the socialist camp to consolidating world peace and promoting friendship among the people of all countries.

    But the U.S. imperialists and the Yugoslav revisionists are unwilling to admit this historical fact. According to Nixon, the Leninist policy of peaceful coexistence is "a dangerous communist trap." Tito and Kardelj are also birds of a feather. They not only distort the essence and basic content of the Leninist policy of peaceful coexistence, but also try their best to spread doubts among the people of the world about the true nature of the goals of the foreign policy of socialist countries and its correctness.

    Sometimes, some rulers and thinkers of aggressive U.S. imperialism, seeing the qualitative changes in the balance of international forces, are forced to admit the possibility of "peaceful coexistence." But what the imperialists care about is to interpret "coexistence" in accordance with their class interests, in accordance with the political situation and internal specific socio-economic conditions of the international capitalist system. For example, everyone knows that they demand that under the conditions of peaceful coexistence, a certain "social peace" must be achieved, that the national liberation wars of the enslaved people must be stopped, that the revolutionary activities of Marxist-Leninist parties and the working class and other organizations of the laboring masses in capitalist countries must be stopped, that any critical attacks on the political system of these countries must be stopped, and that the working class and the laboring masses should not make any social and economic demands on the bourgeoisie who rule them. The "social peace" that the capitalists dream of also includes a complete ideological and political truce.

    The Yugoslav revisionists, repeating these demands of the imperialist reactionary group and sugarcoating them with Marxist phrases, deliberately and painstakingly extend the meaning of peaceful coexistence to the ideological and political spheres in order to be able to do whatever they want in playing the role of a "Trojan horse."

    Kardelj, while repeating the reformist views that have been refuted by the historical development of society, writes: The current situation promotes "the ruling forces of capitalist society to compromise with the working class and make concessions to the working class. At the same time, this strengthens the position of the working class and makes it easier for it to successfully use parliamentary means of struggle and bourgeois democratic forms to strengthen its political influence in society as soon as possible and realize its socialist demands and goals." Need further comment? This treasure was unearthed from the "socialist" mind of Kardelj. In more plain language, Kardelj is telling the working class of capitalist countries: Don't waste your time organizing to fight for your rights. The bourgeoisie of your own country ("the economic forces of capitalist society") will reach out to embrace you, hand over its skyscrapers and factories to you, and hand over its political power to you so that you can coexist peacefully with it. Kardelj goes on to say that the process of socialist victory is the result of the interweaving of revolution and evolution, that is, "the interweaving of the peaceful political struggle and gradual acquisition of political status of socialist forces and other progressive forces and the material evolution in the social foundation." Do these inferences and other arguments written in the theoretical books that have been "carefully pieced together" not clearly show an attempt to spread the notorious reformist theory of "peaceful growing of capitalism into socialism" internationally? This theory was even called despicable by Kautsky, the predecessor of modern revisionism, in 1909.

    Of course, bourgeois democracy is a hundred times easier and more conducive to the realization of the political and social demands of the working class than fascism, but to overestimate bourgeois democracy and worship it under current conditions is not only a harmful illusion, but also a betrayal of the interests of the working class. De Gaulle's "democracy" limits the parliamentary power of the Communist Party, which was and is the most powerful party in France, to the minimum, and Adenauer's "democracy" outlawed the German Communist Party, while the Social Democratic Party there coexists peacefully with militarist and revanchist forces. In this case, what can the working class in Western Europe do? Abandon the illusion of reformism, determine their share and role in society, and continue to carry out a resolute and organized struggle? Or take the path of revisionism, which Kardelj promotes, as the savior and victory? Marxists-Leninists, as materialists and dialecticians, have a clear concept of peaceful coexistence as a historical category, and in no case abandon its due class content and its necessary political weight. It will never and should never, as the Yugoslav revisionists dream of, disarm the working class and reconcile with antagonistic classes, put out the class struggle, suppress national liberation struggles and anti-colonialist struggles, and put out the world's progressive movement. On the contrary, it should help to avoid a devastating world war by uniting and further mobilizing the people of all countries against the conspiracies of aggressive U.S. imperialism and other reactionary forces.

    Kardelj, in citing Marxism-Leninism, says that ideas and thoughts have material roots and foundations in certain socio-economic relations. The ideas and thoughts of Kardelj and the Yugoslav revisionist group clearly show that their material roots and material foundations lie in the close relationship that has been established between Belgrade and Washington, between "socialist" Yugoslavia and imperialist America. This can not only explain the political views, thoughts, and theoretical views of the Yugoslav revisionists, but also explain their specific and daily positions on the main issues in international relations. Uncle Sam spent tens of billions of dollars not to build "socialism" in Yugoslavia, but to overthrow socialism and support the anti-socialist forces headed by the Tito group.

    Kardelj and his companions try their best to clamor that "socialist" Yugoslavia advocates "active coexistence" with all countries. However, the reality and the facts are just the opposite. The Yugoslav revisionists, proceeding from their own interests, understand "active coexistence" as their right to actively interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, to destroy the minimum standards of international law, and to instigate sabotage and murder in neighboring countries. The example of Hungary should not be forgotten.

    This "work" by Kardelj is not a manifestation of "straddling two boats," nor is it a reflection of the so-called "supra-group" stance of the Yugoslav revisionists. On the contrary, with the purpose it proposes and the means it uses, it irrefutably proves that the Belgrade Tito group is sitting in Washington's chair, that it has long obeyed the orders of the imperialist group, serves imperialism, is hired by American monopoly capitalists, and is the mortal enemy of Marxism-Leninism, socialism, and peace.
            ×　　　　×　　　　×
    For all these reasons, the persistent, consistent, principled, and continuous struggle against the enemies of Marxism-Leninism, the enemies of peace and socialism, the aggressive imperialism, and the Yugoslav revisionism is the sacred, urgent, and constant task of all communist and workers' parties, of all the countries of our powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. It is the important task of all true Marxists-Leninists and internationalists, and of those who cherish the glorious cause of socialism and peace.

    Therefore, the opposition to revisionism, especially the opposition to the Yugoslav revisionists, is inseparable from the struggle against imperialism, for peace and socialism, for understanding among the people of all countries, for peaceful coexistence, and for guaranteeing the most beautiful and tranquil future for mankind.

    疯狂的反马克思主义者和战争贩子的走狗
    ——略论卡德尔的“社会主义与战争”一书
    阿尔巴尼亚  优素福·阿利巴利  艾尔弗雷德·乌契
    南斯拉夫的宣传机器就卡德尔新著的“社会主义与战争”一书大肆喧嚷。西方反动集团和改良主义集团叫喊说，这本书是反对共产主义和进步势力的新贡献。题目本身，章节的构造，特别是全书的内容都说明，被认为现代修正主义主要理论家之一的卡德尔，代表并受命于贝尔格莱德铁托集团，为自己提出了十分具体而恶毒的既定的目的。
    卡德尔的“作品”恰恰在目前出现，丝毫不是偶然的。富有侵略性的美帝国主义战争贩子正在进一步毒化国际局势，麻痹世界爱好和平的力量，分裂国际共产主义运动和社会主义各国的团结。卡德尔的这种作法是美帝国主义所发动的这些新的运动的不可分割的部分，这就是卡德尔“作品”的真正目的，而同中国共产党人的论辩，只不过是掩饰这一目的的遁辞。实际上，攻击中国共产党人，也就是攻击马克思列宁主义。因为中国共产党过去和现在都一直站在正确的思想立场上，始终不渝地维护马克思列宁主义。
    南斯拉夫修正主义者想用这个新的“作品”来攻击、歪曲和推翻马克思列宁主义的基本原则，以便维护美帝国主义的侵略政策。这是一种最后挣扎的企图，妄想歪曲和从资产阶级意识形态的立场渗杂上马克思主义的辞句，来谈论目前国际局势的主要问题、列宁主义的和平共处政策、社会主义建设和社会主义阵营各国间的关系，从而卖力地美化帝国主义。可见，南斯拉夫修正主义者就是这样在马克思列宁主义“承认者和保护者”的假面具的掩饰下，把自己装扮成反对教条主义和宗派主义的人。但实际上，他们仍然是富有侵略性的美帝国主义的辩护士，竭力向无往不胜的马克思列宁主义思想、向社会主义和共产主义、向以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结、向和平和各国人民间的谅解，放射他们的毒箭。
    一
    修正主义者卡德尔在他的文章中所使用的伎俩是典型的，是马克思列宁主义的敌人、共产主义和工人运动的叛徒和资产阶级及帝国主义的辩护士所惯用的。作者广泛使用政治欺骗和诡辩，肆无忌惮地歪曲马克思列宁主义经典作家和中国共产党人的思想，或凭空制造莫须有的论点和看法，而其后根据情况予以推翻或用来利于自己的立场。
    对美国领导集团说来，当前最大的“坏事”就是社会主义各国的团结，就是各国人民争取和平和反对美帝国主义者的侵略政策的坚决斗争。他们希望“补救”这个“坏事”，而将南斯拉夫修正主义者也投入攻势。卡德尔最近的“作品”正证明了这一点。
    卡德尔伪造马克思科学最主要问题的基本原则，他攻击马克思列宁主义关于战争的根源是剥削制度的本性和实质的这一著名论点。卡德尔写道：“战争的不可避免性从来都不是绝对的，注定的。它一直取决于力量的对比。”卡德尔的这一论点从根本上修正了马克思列宁主义关于战争的起源和实质的观点，以否认战争对一切剥削社会曾是不可避免的。
    马克思列宁主义教导说，战争作为历史范畴是有阶级内容的，是敌对的剥削制度的产物，是这些社会的各阶级间和各国间敌对矛盾的产物，是它们的政策以其他手段和正是以暴力手段的继续。修正主义者卡德尔竭力把马克思列宁主义的经典作家说成是资产阶级和平主义者，加之以模糊不清的思想，说什么“战争是内部革命运动和社会内部进程的发展的障碍。”
    共产党人一贯强调他们同资产阶级和平主义者之间要有原则性的区别，共产党人把战争区分为正义的和非正义的。马克思列宁主义的经典作家从这种区分得出结论：革命运动必须看成是积极的，只有正义的战争才是进步的，并谴责帝国主义的掠夺和侵略的非正义战争是反动的。列宁曾经写道：我们跟资产阶级和平主义者不同，“我们懂得战争和国内阶级斗争有必然的联系，懂得不消灭阶级和建立社会主义就不能消灭战争，完全承认国内战争即被压迫阶级反对压迫阶级……的战争的合理性、进步性和必然性。”（列宁全集中文版第21卷第279页）卡德尔这位捏造者硬说马克思列宁主义的奠基人“未曾将”战争可以避免“同历史上的任何具体日期联系起来，而只同那些将决定人们的行动的社会发展的一系列物质的以及思想的因素的成熟联系起来。”实际上，马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林始终是将战争的消灭同“历史上的一个固定的日子”联在一起的，正是同在全世界推翻资本主义的“日子”、同建成社会主义联在一起的。但是他们不曾相信在资本主义统治的条件下，各种各样的战争能够避免，在马克思、恩格斯和列宁的时代所发生的一切变化都是在资本主义制度内所发生的，是资本主义各国在力量对比上的变化。正如列宁所说的，这些变化只会导致一个结果，只会导致世界分为帝国主义国家的敌对集团，而这些集团的对抗性矛盾即造成帝国主义的掠夺战争。因此，列宁强调说：在这样情况下，不可能把刺刀埋在地下，依靠和平主义的激昂梦想的辞藻来结束战争，而必须通过内战、通过劳动者的革命战争来反对帝国主义资产阶级。
    对卡德尔来说，避免战争是帝国主义本性改变的结果。按照他的说法，帝国主义从列宁的时代不曾改变只是一面，只是外貌，或如他自己所说的是道德或伦理面貌的一面，但是他认为帝国主义的本性实质已有了根本的改变。现在对卡德尔来说，帝国主义已不再是富有侵略性的了，已无能为力进行奴役和侵略战争了。
    是否有必要举出某一事实来证明帝国主义侵略本性已改变了多少吗？帝国主义者成了第二次世界大战后国际局势尖锐化的制造者，他们是“冷战”“实力地位”政策的创造者，他们建立了侵略性军事集团，如北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织、中央条约组织等。他们在朝鲜、越南、埃及、阿尔及利亚等地发动了侵略战争，他们曾用战争威胁叙利亚和伊拉克，他们的军队曾在黎巴嫩登陆，侵占台湾。他们继续进行军备竞赛，反对禁止原子武器和彻底裁军。他们破坏了高级会议，派间谍飞机侵犯了苏联的主权，对社会主义各国进行挑衅。
    帝国主义者的侵略活动和行为是无止境的，只有南斯拉夫修正主义者在竭力为之缩小、减轻。
    卡德尔的论点不能不使人想起考茨基的臭名远扬的“超帝国主义”的理论。考茨基在第一次世界大战当帝国主义各国的矛盾尖锐到顶点的时候，宣称“新”的时代、“和平的帝国主义”时代开始了。列宁对这种理论的立场是大家所知道的，列宁认为这种理论是掩盖机会主义第二国际头子的社会沙文主义的手段，是在群众中散布资产阶级和平主义的幻想的手段。南斯拉夫修正主义给考茨基的这种理论披上当前时髦的外衣，正在复活这种理论。他们预告着“温和的反侵略的帝国主义的新时代”。1959年12月4日的“战斗报”把美帝国主义的主要代表之一艾森豪威尔说成是“消灭冷战事业、巩固持久和平和不同的政治制度之间和平竞赛的奠基人”，不是偶然的。卡德尔在强调铁托关于什么“现代化技术使得争取和平的斗争现实了”的论点的“温和性”的同时，拥护垄断托辣斯的军备竞赛政策，重复五角大楼和联邦国防军的将军们的骇人听闻的神经质的“理论”，说什么似乎原子弹和氢弹在帝国主义者手中做为“制止力量”在保卫着和平等，这就是为什么卡德尔的书是对富有侵略性的帝国主义、军备竞赛、军国主义的真正赞扬。卡德尔就是这样卑鄙地诬蔑中国人民和中国共产党人，歪曲他们在主要问题上的立场，赞扬帝国主义的。卡德尔玩弄马克思列宁主义，广泛攻击中国共产党人，公然宣传自己的修正主义的反马克思主义的观点。
    掩藏当前的帝国主义的侵略本性，保护侵略战争的真正负责人，麻痹爱好和平的力量，攻击和歪曲无往不胜的马克思列宁主义思想，这就是卡德尔的“拙劣的理论”的目的。因此，他的文章得到了以美国领导集团为首的当前一切反动势力的喝彩和谅解。

    社会主义和资本主义是性质完全相反的两种社会制度，社会主义和资本主义的本质区别也表现在战争与和平的问题上。社会主义这种社会制度是决不同掠夺战争调和的，社会主义是主张和平的，而资本主义是主张侵略战争的，这是一个根本性的真理。但是修正主义者作为帝国主义的走狗的职责，使得他们甚至否认这个根本性的真理。卡德尔在谈到社会主义阵营时，始终故意说成是一个“军事单位”、
  “人为的军事组织”，说成是一个和帝国主义侵略性的军事集团同样的“军事集团”。这种修正主义的虚构有其本身的“逻辑”。进行这种捏造，一方面是为了把帝国主义国家说成是“防御侵略”，一方面是为了把国际局势尖锐化、军备竞赛、“冷战”和“热战”的责任推卸给社会主义阵营。
    对卡德尔来说，社会主义阵营、社会主义国家不仅不是保卫和平的积极的决定性的因素，相反，在他看来，“社会主义阵营和社会主义国家是这方面的消极因素”。卡德尔无耻地宣称战争危险来自社会主义，侵略的、非正义的战争，对作为一种社会经济制度的社会主义来说，并不是不相容的。华盛顿的统治者们对于这种说法热烈喝彩，并为此付给了千百万美元。卡德尔捏造说，“马克思主义经典作家并不排除某一社会主义国家也进行非正义战争的可能性”。
    马克思作为革命者和真正的科学家，证明了资本主义和社会主义在战争与和平的问题上也是两种相反的社会类型，强调指出资本主义是同战争、同“政治上错乱”相联系的，而社会主义是同和平相联系的。马克思曾写道：“……与那个经济贫困和政治昏瞆的旧社会相对立，正在诞生一个新社会，而这个新社会的国际原则将是和平，因为每一个民族都将是同样由劳动统治的！”（马克思恩格斯文选两卷集第一卷469页）列宁的著作中从来没有不提出只有社会主义才能给人类保证和平。然而卡德尔公然违背历史现实，拼命“从理论上论证”似乎侵略战争不是同社会主义不相容的。他写道：“任何一个社会主义国家都不会仅仅因为是社会主义的而自动取得侵略活动倾向的免疫性。”实际上，正是因为我们各国是社会主义的，因此，对我们这些国家说来，即使任何侵略倾向也是不相容的。
    社会主义不需要战争。在社会主义社会中没有热心于军备竞赛、热心于军国主义化、热心于侵略战争的力量。我们各国人民和党为建设共产主义社会而斗争，在共产主义社会中将得到普遍的福利、全民的繁荣和各民族间的永久和平，社会主义各国需要持久和平，以便建设这样一个社会。因此，社会主义国家遵循始终不渝的和平政策，反对帝国主义的侵略政策。
    但是，卡德尔的“理论”演习只不过是资产阶级宣传有关“共产主义危险”、有关“革命输出”的滥调，在“社会主义”的辞句伪装下的重复而已。除了资产阶级思想家、帝国主义的宣传家——形形色色的尼克松、赫脱、哈里曼、肯尼迪、洛克菲勒之流，除了共产主义的知名和不知名的敌人以外，还有谁今天竭力叫喊“共产主义危险”、叫喊有人在向古巴、刚果和全世界“输出”革命呢？除了帝国主义的叫卖人以外，还有谁疯狂到以至于控诉苏联和人民中国进行侵略和占领？铁托修正主义集团还包括资本主义已失败的事业的积极辩护士——“社会主义者”卡德尔在内，过去和现在都喊破了喉咙，正是参加这个资本家的胆小和目光短浅的合唱。实际上这是想像出来的“危险”，因为“革命输出”的思想是同马克思列宁主义、同社会主义类型的国家不相容的。
    所有共产党的出发点是列宁的论点：“革命是不能按照定货单和协议进行的，只有当千千万万的人认为不能再这样生活下去的时候，革命才会爆发。”（列宁全集中文版第27卷449页）共产党人深信社会主义必然在全世界取得胜利。南斯拉夫修正主义者被迫承认战争是可以避免的并能建立持久和平，但千方百计地掩盖取得和平与避免战争的真正道路。他们的代言人卡德尔不承认他所高唱的“力量对比的变化”，首先是同世界社会主义体系的形成直接相关连的。共产党人谈避免世界大战的可能性并不是从南斯拉夫修正主义者所宣扬的关于帝国主义已不再富有侵略性的论调出发，而是从国际力量有利于社会主义和和平的新的对比关系出发的。今天毁灭性的世界大战能够避免，因为存在着以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营——坚不可摧的和平堡垒，是帝国主义实现侵略阴谋的主要障碍。社会主义阵营拥有能够制约侵略者的经济力量和现代化武器，一旦他们发动侵略性的世界战争，将彻底消灭他们，保卫着和平事业的还有所有那些组成所谓和平地区的国家。帝国主义殖民体系的瓦解，国际共产主义和工人运动的扩大和巩固，资本主义世界和平运动的壮大，帝国主义在人民中的孤立，各种反帝运动以及许多其它因素，已使力量对比发生了有利于社会主义的变化，使世界大战有可能避免。但是只要帝国主义还存在，就存在着另一种可能——帝国主义者发动战争的可能。实现这一个或那一个可能，并不像修正主义者所说的那样自然地实现，而取决于和平力量和战争力量之间的斗争。所以，世界社会主义体系的存在，社会主义阵营的团结，和最大限度地动员世界爱好和平的力量就成为保卫人类免于毁灭性战争危险的决定性因素。以美国为首的国际帝国主义力量疯狂地发动攻势，反对这些因素，并使用五角大楼和艾伦·杜勒斯的机构、联合国人员和殖民主义力量、波恩军国主义者和贝尔格莱德修正主义者来实现他们的罪恶企图。在这一方面，列宁的教诲在今天也还是具有很大现实意义的。他在几十年以前就曾写道：“谁以为和平可以轻易获致，谁以为只要一提和平，资产阶级就会用盘子把和平给我们端过来，谁就是一个十分天真的人。”（列宁全集中文版26卷323页）历史性的莫斯科宣言也宣布了列宁关于必须联合各国人民进行长期的始终不懈和坚定不移的斗争、争取和平、反对帝国主义侵略者的思想。宣言说：“这些强大力量的联合可以阻止战争的爆发。如果帝国主义的战争狂人硬要不顾一切发动战争，那么帝国主义就注定灭亡。因为人民绝不会再继续容忍那个给他们带来如此惨重的痛苦和牺牲的制度。”
    三
    人所共知，列宁主义的和平共处政策是社会主义各国外交政策的总路线，这个政策体现在如1957年11月莫斯科宣言这一历史性文件中，体现在每个社会主义国家的日常实践中。这个政策意味着不同社会和政治制度国家之间的国际关系在严格尊重主权、民族独立、经济关系中的互利政策、完全平等和互不干涉内政的基础上获得发展和扩大。社会主义阵营各国的当前对外政策是遵循这些基本原则的，这方面的例子是不胜枚举的。例如苏联和人民中国在同那些不但社会政治结构不同、并且经济条件和它们的国际地位也不同的国家，如芬兰和奥地利、印度和阿联、几内亚和古巴、尼泊尔和阿富汗、柬埔寨和印度尼西亚的关系中，正是依据着列宁主义的和平共处政策。
    世界一切正直的和爱好和平的人士现在都已经公认：执行这一列宁主义的政策是社会主义阵营各国对巩固世界和平与增进各国人民之间的友谊的一个宝贵和非常重要的贡献。
    可是美帝国主义者和南斯拉夫修正主义者不愿承认这一历史事实。按照尼克松的说法，列宁主义的和平共处政策是“一个危险的共产主义陷沟”。铁托和卡德尔也同他是一丘之貉，他们不但歪曲列宁主义的和平共处政策的实质和基本内容，并且还竭力在世界各国人民中散布对社会主义各国外交政策的目的的真正的性质和它的正确性的怀疑。
    有时候，侵略成性的美帝国主义的某些统治者和思想家由于看到了国际力量对比的质的变化，被迫承认“和平共处”的可能性。但是帝国主义者所关心的是把“共处”解释得符合他们的阶级利益，符合国际资本主义体系政治局面和内部具体社会经济条件。例如，大家都知道，他们要求在和平共处的条件下，某种“社会和平”必须取得胜利，停止被奴役人民的民族解放战争，停止资本主义国家内马克思列宁主义政党和工人阶级以及劳动群众的其它组织的革命活动，停止对这些国家的政治制度的任何批评性攻击，工人阶级和劳动群众不要向统治着他们的资产阶级提出任何社会和经济要求，资本家们所梦想的“这种社会和平”也包括意识形态和政治上的完全停火。
    南斯拉夫修正主义重复着帝国主义反动集团的这些要求，用马克思主义的词句给它们涂脂抹粉，他们处心积虑地为了使自己在扮演“特洛伊木马”的角色中畅所欲为，把和平共处的含意也伸延到意识形态和政治领域。
    卡德尔在重弹已被社会的历史发展所驳斥的改良主义观点时写道：目前形势促使“资本主义社会的统治力量和工人阶级进行妥协，向工人阶级让步，同时这加强了工人阶级的阵地，使它更易于尽早地成功地利用议会斗争手段和资产阶级民主形式，来加强它在社会中的政治影响，实现它的社会主义要求和目的。”还需要加以评论吗？这个珍宝是从卡德尔“社会主义”的脑中发掘出来的，用更浅近易懂的话说，卡德尔在告诉资本主义国家的工人阶级：你们别枉费心机地组织起来去争取你们的权利，本国资产阶级（“资本主义社会的经济势力”）自己会向你们伸出手来拥抱你们，把它的高楼大厦和工厂交给你们，把它的政权交给你们，以便使你们和它和平地共处。卡德尔接着说，社会主义胜利的过程是革命和演变交织的结果，即“同社会主义力量和其它进步势力的和平政治斗争和逐步获得政治地位的进程以及同社会基础中的物质演变”交织的结果。从这些推理和“努力拼凑成”的理论书上所写的其他论调，不正清楚地表明了在国际上传播臭名远扬的“资本主义和平长入社会主义”的改良主义理论的企图吗？这一理论甚至现代修正主义的先辈考茨基也在1909年称它为卑鄙的。
    当然资产阶级民主是比法西斯主义百倍地容易被接受和有利于实现工人阶级的政治和社会要求，但是在当前条件下过高地估价资产阶级民主和崇拜这种民主，这不仅是有害的幻想，而且是背叛工人阶级的利益。戴高乐的“民主”把过去和现在都是法国最强大的政党共产党的议会力量限制在最低限度，阿登纳的“民主”取缔了德国共产党，而那里的社会民主党却同军国主义和复仇主义势力和平共处。在这种情况下，西欧的工人阶级还能怎么办呢？抛弃改良主义的幻想，确定自己在社会中的分量和作用，继续进行坚决的和有组织的斗争呢？还是走卡德尔所宣扬的修正主义就是救星和胜利的道路呢？马克思列宁主义者作为唯物论者和辩证论者，对作为历史范畴的和平共处有着明确的概念，在任何情况下都不抛开它应有的阶级内容和它的必需的政治分量，它决不也不应该如南斯拉夫修正主义者所梦寐以求的那样为解除工人阶级的武装同对抗性的阶级作社会调和，扑灭阶级斗争，镇压民族解放斗争和反殖民主义斗争，扑灭世界进步运动。相反，它应该有助于通过团结和进一步动员世界各国人民反对侵略成性的美帝国主义及其他反动力量的阴谋，以避免毁灭性的世界大战。
    卡德尔在援引马克思列宁主义时说：观念和思想在一定的社会经济关系中是具有物质根源和基础的。对卡德尔和南斯拉夫修正主义集团的观念和思想清楚地说明：它们的物质根源和物质基础是在于已经建立了的贝尔格莱德和华盛顿之间、在“社会主义”的南斯拉夫和帝国主义的美国之间的紧密关系，这不仅能用来说明了南斯拉夫修正主义者的政治观点、思想和理论观点，而且也能说明他们对国际关系中主要问题的具体的和日常的立场。山姆大叔花费几十亿美元并不是为了在南斯拉夫建设“社会主义”，而是为了推翻社会主义，扶植以铁托集团为首的反社会主义的力量。
    卡德尔及其同伴竭力叫嚣“社会主义”南斯拉夫主张同所有国家“积极共处”。虽然如此，现实情况和事实却适得其反。南斯拉夫修正主义者从他们的利益出发，把“积极共处”理解为他们积极干涉别国内政，破坏国际法的起码准则，在邻国策动阴谋破坏和杀害的权利。不应忘记匈牙利的例子。
    卡德尔的这个“作品”可以不是“脚踏两只船”的表现，也不是南斯拉夫修正主义者所谓“超集团”立场的反映。相反，它用它自己提出的目的和使用的手段，无可争辩地证明了贝尔格莱德铁托集团的屁股是坐在华盛顿的椅子上，证明它早就听从帝国主义集团的命令，为帝国主义效劳，是美国垄断资本家的雇佣，是马克思列宁主义、社会主义和和平的死敌。
            ×　　　　×　　　　×
    由于所有这些原因，同马克思列宁主义的敌人、和平和社会主义的敌人、侵略成性的帝国主义和南斯拉夫修正主义进行坚持一贯的原则的和不断的斗争，是所有共产党和工人党、是以苏联为首的我们强大的社会主义阵营各国的神圣的迫切的和经常的任务，是一切真正的马克思列宁主义者和国际主义者以及珍视光荣的社会主义和和平事业的人士的重要任务。
    因此，反对修正主义，特别是反对南斯拉夫修正主义者，同反对帝国主义、争取和平和社会主义、争取各国人民之间的谅解、争取和平共处和保障人类最美好的安静的未来的斗争，是不可分割的。
