Reform the Cultivation System, Regulate the Busy and Slack Seasons, Strive for Initiative in Everything
Duanliu Management Area's Autumn Harvest and Planting Proceed Smoothly, Quickly and Well
The number of agricultural labor days invested increased by 32% compared with the same period last year. The wheat planting task was completed in three days, and the sowing period was shortened by half compared with previous years.
(Our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on the 11th) The Duanliu Management Area of the Rocket People's Commune in Qin County, Shanxi Province, reformed the cultivation system and regulated agricultural work during busy and slack seasons, resulting in a new situation of initiative in everything and leadership in all aspects. The "Three Autumns" work is being done quickly and well.
This year, the Duanliu Management Area's reform of the cultivation system in its first year has achieved great results. Because all tasks are advanced, the current autumn harvest and planting work is orderly: winter planting and early spring planting of millet, potatoes, etc. have been harvested, twenty days earlier than ordinary millet; spring planting of millet and potatoes are beginning to be harvested; recently, concentrated labor completed the wheat planting task for the entire management area in three days, shortening the sowing period by more than half compared with previous years. Due to sufficient labor and ample time, the quality of various agricultural tasks has greatly improved. For example, the average base fertilizer for wheat fields reached 220 loads per mu, an increase of 46% compared to last year's fertilizer application. This year, autumn field crops were generally hoed four times and topdressed twice. At the same time, the past habit of not topdressing millet and potatoes due to insufficient labor was changed. Because the cultivation system was fundamentally reformed, a large amount of labor was saved this year, greatly improving labor efficiency. According to the management area's statistics, as of now, the entire management area has invested more than 70,000 labor days in agriculture, an increase of 32% compared with the same period last year. This year, the average labor input per mu of autumn fields is seventeen days, an increase of four days compared with the same period last year, and the labor input level is about 50% higher than that of nearby management areas. Therefore, the growth of autumn fields this year is very good. At the same time, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have also developed greatly.
The Duanliu Management Area is located in the Taihang Mountains, with complex terrain of crisscrossing mountains, rivers, gullies, and beaches. Cultivation has always been extensive. In recent years, with the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, the construction of commune industries, and the development of agricultural capital construction, labor has become increasingly tight. Due to insufficient labor, it is difficult to ensure that all cultivated land is sown in a timely manner in the spring, field processing is difficult to manage in the summer, and the autumn harvest is protracted, sometimes resulting in accidental losses. When formulating the 1960 production plan, the management area's Party branch, in response to the problem of insufficient labor, organized cadres, old peasants, commune members, and scientific and technical personnel to conduct specific analysis and research. Through repeated discussions, it was found that there is a phenomenon of "three tight, three loose, and one idle" in agricultural production throughout the year. The local area mainly grows autumn crops. During the Guyu (Grain Rain), Lixia (Start of Summer), and Xiaoman (Grain Full) seasons, the task of sowing all autumn crops must be completed. This time is concentrated for agricultural work, and the amount of work required accounts for more than one-third of the annual production labor; from Xiaoshu (Minor Heat) to Dashu (Major Heat), the three major agricultural tasks of summer harvest, summer planting, and field processing are intertwined and carried out, which is highly time-sensitive, accounting for about 15% of the annual labor input; the third busy period is the autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing, and the amount of work required accounts for about one-quarter of the annual labor input. These three periods are about one hundred and twenty days, and the amount of labor invested accounts for 75% to 80% of the annual total. "Three loose" periods are: Jingzhe (Awakening of Insects) to Qingming (Pure Brightness), Xiaoman (Grain Full) to Xiazhi (Summer Solstice), and Liqiu (Start of Autumn) to Chushu (End of Heat), when there is less agricultural work. "One idle" period is: two or three months in winter after the autumn harvest. During the spring sowing period, the entire management area requires nearly 19,000 labor days, while the total labor force can only invest 7,800 labor days. Even if labor efficiency is doubled, it is difficult to complete the task. On the contrary, there is not much agricultural work to do in winter. Thus, the root cause of the uneven distribution of busy and slack seasons was found, mainly because agricultural work is excessively concentrated. Everyone calculated that if agricultural work is distributed, the problem of insufficient labor can be basically solved.
When the Duanliu Management Area started to solve the labor problem by reforming cultivation habits, on the one hand, it summarized the achievements of various experimental fields in the management area related to improving the sowing period, and absorbed and studied local farmers' experiences from various aspects; on the other hand, it learned and promoted various experiences from other places, and put forward methods to regulate agricultural activities on the premise of ensuring increased production. First, according to local climatic conditions and the adaptability of crops, spring-sown crops are divided into three periods for sowing: winter, early spring, and spring. For example, learning from the experience of Shanxi Agricultural College for planting millet, combined with the experimental achievements of local experimental fields, spring sowing was changed to winter sowing, frost-resistant sowing, and spring sowing. Other crops that can be sown earlier are sown in advance separately. Potatoes and hemp are sown two seasons earlier, and black beans, melons, and vegetables are sown one season earlier. This disperses the tasks during the spring planting period and avoids the phenomenon of various crops being squeezed together and sown at the same time, which uses labor excessively concentrated. Second, rearrange agricultural work and change the old habits that have been followed for many years, and carry out agricultural work during busy seasons as early as possible in the slack seasons. For example, actively accumulate and create fertilizer in winter, cut wasteland grass to smoke fertilizer, turn and dig livestock pens and pig and sheep pens, etc., to prepare fertilizer for spring sowing; combine water conservancy construction to renovate cultivated land, and all cultivated land is harrowed and ground. As soon as spring begins, send fertilizer, cultivate land, and dry seeds as much as possible, and carry out the work before sowing as early as possible. Third, natural disasters have a great impact on production and labor. Sudden attacks often create unexpected labor tension. Spring drought cannot catch seedlings, and summer is hit by hail. Once replanting is destroyed, the amount of labor is greatly increased and the entire labor layout is disrupted. The Duanliu Management Area has learned from the lessons in this area and explored the laws of various disasters. By reforming the cultivation system, a prevention method was found. One of the local characteristics is spring drought. In order to prevent and control spring drought, combine autumn plowing with harrowing, harrow the land against the frost before thawing, seize the moisture in early spring and sow seeds early, promote the use of moisture-retaining tools, and take comprehensive measures to ensure full seedlings. Due to the mountainous terrain of the Duanliu Management Area, hailstorms often occur in some areas around Xiaoshu (Minor Heat) and Dashu (Major Heat). In the past, millet and sorghum were mostly planted in this part of the cultivated land. Once hailstorms occur, production will be reduced. This year, the management area rearranged the production in this area, changing the planting to potatoes and sweet potatoes, and corn was planted in the nearby area. The tubers of root crops are formed underground, and hailstorms cannot damage them in the later stage. Corn has strong disaster resistance, which can avoid and reduce the impact of hailstorms on increasing production. (Attached picture)

    改革耕作制度　调节农活忙闲　事事争取主动
    段柳管理区秋收秋种有条不紊既快又好
    农业投工数比去年同期增加32％，三天完成种麦任务，播种期比往年缩短一半
    本报太原11日电　山西省沁县火箭人民公社段柳管理区改革耕作制度，调节农忙农闲季节的农活，出现了事事主动样样领先的新局面，三秋工作做得既快又好。
    段柳管理区今年改革耕作制度的第一年就收到了很大成效。由于各项工作样样赶前，目前秋收秋种工作秩序有条不乱：冬种和早春种谷、马铃薯等已经收割完毕，比一般谷子早收获了二十天，春种谷和马铃薯正在开始收获；最近，集中劳力三天就完成了全管理区种麦任务，播种期比往年缩短了一半多。由于有足够的劳力和充足的时间，各项农活的质量有了极大的提高。如麦田底肥每亩平均达到了二百二十担，比去年的施肥量增加了46％。今年秋田作物普遍锄四次、追肥两次，同时改变了过去由于劳力顾不过来，谷子、马铃薯不追肥的习惯。由于从根本上改革耕作制度，今年节省了大批劳力，大大提高了劳动效率。据管理区统计，截至目前为止，全管理区农业投工已达七万多个，比去年同时期投工数增加32％。今年秋田平均每亩投工十七个，比去年同期增加了四个，比附近一般管理区投工水平超过了50％左右。因此今年秋田生长情况很好。与此同时，林、牧、副、渔业也都大有发展。
    段柳管理区地处太行山区，山川沟滩纵横交错地形复杂，历来耕作粗放。近几年来随着农、林、牧、副、渔业全面发展，兴建公社工业和开展农业基本建设，劳动力越来越显得紧张。由于劳力不足，春季难以保证全部耕地适时下种，夏季田间加工顾不过来，秋收拉的时间过长，有时形成意外损失。在制订1960年生产规划时，管理区党支部针对劳力不足的问题，组织干部、老农、社员和科学技术人员具体地作了分析研究。通过反复探讨，发现农业生产一年之间有“三紧、三松、一闲”现象。当地以种植秋作物为主，谷雨、立夏、小满三个节令要完成全部秋作物播种任务，这个时间农活集中，需工量就占到了全年生产用工的三分之一以上；小暑到大暑，夏收、夏种、田间加工三项主要农活交织在一起进行，时间性较强，约占全年投工15％；第三个紧张时期是秋收、秋种、秋耕，需工量约占全年投工四分之一以上。这三个时期大约一百二十多天，投工量达全年总数75％到80％。“三松”是：惊蛰到清明，小满到夏至，立秋到处暑，农活都较少。一闲是：秋收后冬季两、三个月。全管理区春播期间就需工近一万九千多个，而全部劳力仅能投工七千八百多个，就是提高劳动效率一倍，完成任务也有困难。相反冬季却没有更多的农活可作。从而也找到忙闲不均的根源，主要是农活过分集中而形成。大家算了一笔账，如果把农活分散开，劳力不足的问题就可以基本上得到解决。
    段柳管理区从改革耕作习惯着手解决劳力问题时，一方面总结了管理区有关改进播种期各色各样的试验田的成就，又从多方面吸收研究了当地农家经验；一方面学习推广外地的各种经验，在确保增产的前提下，提出了调节农事活动的办法。第一、根据当地气候条件和作物的适应能力，把春播作物分为冬季、早春、春季三个时期播种。如种谷子学习山西农学院经验，结合当地试验田的试验成就，由春播改变为冬种、顶凌种、春种三个时期播种，其它可以提早播种的作物都分别提前播种，马铃薯、大麻提前两个节令，黑豆、瓜菜提早一个节令播种。这样分散了春种期间的任务，避免了各种作物挤在一起同时播种，用劳力过于集中的现象。第二、重新安排农活，改变沿袭了多少年的老习惯，把农忙时期的农活，尽可能提前到农闲季节来作。譬如在冬季积极积肥造肥、割荒草熏肥、翻挖畜圈猪羊圈等，就为春播准备好肥料；结合水利建设整修耕地，把所有耕地进行了耙磨。一开春就送肥、整地、翻晒种子，尽量把播种以前的工作提前进行。第三、自然灾害对生产劳动影响很大，突然的袭击往往形成意外的劳力紧张。春旱捉不住苗，夏季遭雹灾，一经毁种就大大增加了劳动量，打乱了整个劳力布局。段柳管理区从总结这方面的教训中摸索到各种灾害发生的规律，通过改革耕作制度找到防止办法。当地特点之一是春旱，为了防治春旱，秋耕时结合耙耢，解冻前顶凌耙地，春季及早抢墒下种，推广使用保墒工具，采取综合性的措施来保证全苗。段柳管理区由于山势地形的关系，有一部分地区每到小暑、大暑前后，常发生雹雨。过去这一部分耕地种植谷子、高粱较多，一经雹雨即形成减产，今年管理区重新安排了这个地区的生产，改种马铃薯和甘薯，附近地区种植玉米。薯类块茎结在地下，到后期冰雹损害不了，玉米抗灾能力强，这样就可避免和减轻雹灾对增产的影响。（附图片）
