Xinhua News Agency, October 26th, Washington dispatch: The U.S. Department of Defense on the 24th allocated an additional $181.1 million to accelerate the development of "Polaris" missiles launched from submarines. To date, the United States has spent nearly $3 billion on research and production of "Polaris" missiles.

    It is reported that Lockheed Aircraft Corporation of the United States signed a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense yesterday, responsible for using this new appropriation to research and develop "Polaris" missiles, trying to make its range reach 1,500 miles to 2,500 miles. According to existing plans, "Polaris" missiles with a range of 1,200 miles will not be able to equip nuclear submarines until the end of this year.

    According to U.S. Navy personnel, while accelerating missile development, the United States is building new "Lafayette"-class nuclear submarines with a displacement of 7,000 tons to prepare to carry the "Polaris" missiles with a range of 2,500 miles that are still under research. It is revealed that the first "Lafayette"-class nuclear submarine is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1963 to the beginning of 1964.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, October 25th: The Central Treaty Organization's aggressive clique, controlled by the United States, began large-scale naval "exercises" today on the sea outside this port.

    中央条约组织举行军事“演习”加剧紧张局势
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部24日增拨一亿八千一百万美元加速发展由潜水艇发射的“北极星”式导弹。至此，美国为研究和生产“北极星”导弹支出的费用已接近三十亿美元。
    据报道，美国洛克希德飞机公司昨天同美国国防部签订了一份合同，负责用这笔新的拨款研究和发展“北极星”导弹，设法使其射程达到一千五百英里至二千五百英里。而按照现有的计划，射程一千二百英里的“北极星”导弹也要到今年年底才能用来装备核潜艇。
    据美国海军人士透露，美国在加速发展导弹的同时正在建造排水量为七千吨的新型的“拉裴德”级核潜艇来准备携带还在研究中的射程二千五百英里的“北极星”导弹。据透露，头一艘“拉裴德”级的核潜艇计划在1963年底至1964年初建成。
    新华社卡拉奇25日电　美国控制下的中央条约组织侵略集团今天在这里港外的海面上开始举行大规模的海军“演习”。这是这个军事集团连年来为了制造国际紧张局势、准备侵略战争而举行的一系列“军事演习”中的一次。
