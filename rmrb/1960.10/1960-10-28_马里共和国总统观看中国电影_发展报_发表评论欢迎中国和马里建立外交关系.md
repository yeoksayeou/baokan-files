Xinhua News Agency, Bamako, October 25th: To strengthen the friendship between the people of the Republic of Mali and the people of the Soviet Union and China, the Mali Peace Movement held a film screening of Malian, Soviet, and Chinese films last night in Bamako.

    President of the Republic of Mali, Modibo Keita, government ministers, and all members of the Political Bureau of the ruling Sudanese Union attended the film screening. They were warmly welcomed by the audience as they entered the hall.

    Ke Hua, the Chinese Ambassador to Guinea currently visiting here, the head of the Soviet trade delegation, and the Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Czechoslovakian Embassy in Bamako also attended the film screening.

    The program included Malian newsreels, the Soviet film "Moscow Youth Festival," and the Chinese color film "Celebrating Ten Years."

Xinhua News Agency, Bamako, October 26th: The "Development," the organ of the Sudanese Union Party, the ruling party of the Republic of Mali, published an article today commenting on the mutual recognition between China and Mali and the visit of Chinese Ambassador to Guinea, Ke Hua, to Mali. It stated, "The relationship between People's China and the Republic of Mali has entered a stage of active cooperation. This is the normal state of friendly relations that naturally establishes itself between nations gradually shaking off the clutches of imperialism."

    Referring to the Republic of Mali's position in favor of restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, the article said, "A country with over six hundred million people, whose democratic government is making it one of the most powerful countries in the world, has no representation in the United Nations," while the Chiang Kai-shek clique, "kept by foreign trusts and driven out of mainland China by the Chinese people," "votes in the United Nations and occupies the permanent seat in the Security Council. This, in our view, is the most serious injustice of our time."

    马里共和国总统观看中国电影
    “发展报”发表评论欢迎中国和马里建立外交关系
    据新华社巴马科25日电　马里和平运动为了加强马里共和国人民同苏联和中国人民之间的友谊，昨晚在巴马科举行了马里、苏联和中国的电影放映会。
    马里共和国总统莫迪博·凯塔、政府各部部长、执政党苏丹联盟政治局全体委员都出席了电影放映会。当他们步入大厅时，受到了观众热烈的欢迎。
    目前在这里访问的中国驻几内亚大使柯华、苏联贸易代表团团长和捷克斯洛伐克驻巴马科大使馆临时代办也出席了电影放映会。
    会上放映了马里的新闻片、苏联影片“莫斯科青年联欢节”和中国彩色影片“欢庆十年”。
    据新华社巴马科26日电　马里共和国执政党苏丹联盟党机关报“发展报”今天在一篇评论中国和马里互相承认以及中国驻几内亚大使柯华访问马里的文章中说：“人民中国和马里共和国之间的关系进入了积极合作的阶段，这是符合逐渐摆脱帝国主义的魔爪的国家之间自然建立起来的友好关系的正常状态的。”
    谈到马里共和国赞成恢复中国在联合国的合法席位的立场时，文章说，“一个拥有六亿多人口的、其民主政府正在使之成为世界上最强大国家之一的国家在联合国没有代表”，而一个由外国托辣斯所豢养的、已被中国人民赶出中国大陆的蒋介石集团“却在联合国投票，并且在安全理事会中窃据常任理事国的席位，这在我们看来是我们时代最严重的非正义事态”。
