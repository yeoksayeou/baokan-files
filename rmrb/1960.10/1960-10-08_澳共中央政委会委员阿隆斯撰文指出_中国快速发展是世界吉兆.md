Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, 6th: Aarons, a member of the Central Political Committee of the Australian Communist Party, said in an article celebrating the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China that the development of the Chinese revolution "proves that Comrade Mao Zedong's conclusions on China's future are correct."

The article, published in today's "Communist Review" of Australia, stated that the founding of the People's Republic of China was "the result of one of the greatest revolutions in history." The Chinese people have established great heroic achievements in an "epic struggle."

The article said that the Chinese Communist Party, over twenty-eight years (referring to 1921-1949), was engaged in applying Marxism-Leninism to solve the complex problems of the Chinese revolution, and led the Chinese people to boldly develop Marxism-Leninism under vast territorial conditions, thereby solving various problems in the Chinese revolution.

The article ridiculed the imperialists' "predictions" eleven years ago that the Chinese people "will never be able to solve their own problems." It pointed out that in the past eleven years, China has solved the food problem, and industry has developed at an astonishing and increasingly rapid pace. At the same time, it has also carried out a "great cultural revolution." The article said that in eleven years, China has changed from being a pawn in world affairs to a major power, and its opinions must now be heeded. Progressives around the world regard this change in China "as a good omen for the whole world."

The article then refuted the vicious slanders spread by the enemies of China and socialism against the Chinese People's Communes, as well as the accusations that "China wants war and opposes peaceful coexistence" and that "China threatens peace." It pointed out that China and India were the first to advocate the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Just a few weeks ago, China once again advocated that Asian and Pacific Rim countries, including the United States, sign a treaty of non-aggression.

The article praised the People's Republic of China for firmly safeguarding world peace and vigorously engaging in socialist construction, and condemned the U.S. policy of hostility towards China as a threat to world peace.

The article concluded by saying that the Australian Communist Party has consistently supported the struggle of the Chinese people. Today, it holds high the banner of proletarian internationalism, strives for friendship with China, supports the restoration of its legitimate seat in the United Nations, and opposes the imperialist movement of hostility towards China.

    澳共中央政委会委员阿隆斯撰文指出
    中国快速发展是世界吉兆
    新华社6日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚共产党中央政治委员会委员阿隆斯在一篇庆祝中华人民共和国成立十一周年的文章里说，中国革命的发展“证明了毛泽东同志对中国前途的论断是正确的。”
    这篇刊登在今天出版的澳大利亚“共产主义评论”上的文章说，中华人民共和国的成立是“历史上最伟大的革命之一的结果”。中国人民在“史诗般的斗争”中树立了伟大的英雄业绩。
    文章说，中国共产党在二十八年中（指1921—1949）从事于把马克思列宁主义运用于解决中国革命的复杂问题，并领导中国人民在国土辽阔的条件下大胆地发展了马克思列宁主义，从而解决了中国革命中的各种问题。
    文章嘲笑了帝国主义者十一年前关于中国人民“永远解决不了自己的问题”的“预言”。它指出，十一年来，中国解决了粮食问题，工业以令人吃惊的越来越快的速度发展着。与此同时，它还进行了“伟大的文化革命”。文章说，在十一年中，中国已经从原来在世界事务中充当一名小卒的地位变成了大国，它的意见现在必须受到注意。世界各地进步人士把中国的这种变化“看作是全世界的吉兆”。
    文章接着驳斥了中国和社会主义的敌人所散播的诬蔑中国人民公社、以及什么“中国要战争、反对和平共处”、“中国威胁和平”等对中国的恶毒诽谤。它指出，正是中国和印度一起首先倡导了和平共处五项原则。仅仅在几个星期以前，中国还再次主张亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约。
    文章赞扬中华人民共和国坚定地维护世界和平、大力从事社会主义建设，并谴责美国敌视中国的政策是对世界和平的威胁。
    文章最后说，澳大利亚共产党一贯支持中国人民的斗争。今天它高举无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，努力争取同中国友好，支持恢复它在联合国的合法席位，并反对帝国主义敌视中国的运动。
