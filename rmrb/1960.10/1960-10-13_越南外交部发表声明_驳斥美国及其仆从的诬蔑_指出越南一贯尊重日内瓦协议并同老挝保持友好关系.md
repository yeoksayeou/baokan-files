　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th - The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today sternly refuted the rumors recently spread by the propaganda organs of US imperialism and its puppet states, alleging that troops of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are conducting activities in Laos.

　　The statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, published here, pointed out that the news spread by the news agencies and radio stations of the United States, Thailand, and the South Vietnamese authorities that troops of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are operating in Lao territory is completely unfounded. Prince Souvanna Phouma, the Prime Minister of Laos, and Vientiane Radio have also repeatedly denied this.

　　The spokesperson emphasized that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly opposes US imperialism and its puppet states fabricating baseless news to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in order to cover up their notorious conspiracy to interfere in Laos.

　　The spokesperson said that the consistent policy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards the Kingdom of Laos is: non-interference in Laos' internal affairs, respect for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Geneva Agreements on Laos, and the maintenance of friendly relations with the Kingdom of Laos.

    越南外交部发表声明
    驳斥美国及其仆从的诬蔑
    指出越南一贯尊重日内瓦协议并同老挝保持友好关系
    新华社河内11日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人今天严厉驳斥美帝国主义及其仆从国家的宣传机关最近散布的所谓越南民主共和国的军队在老挝进行活动的谣言。
    此间公布的越南民主共和国外交部发言人的声明指出，美国、泰国和越南南方当局的通讯社和广播电台散布的所谓越南民主共和国的军队正在老挝领土活动的消息是完全没有根据的。老挝首相梭发那·富马亲王和万象电台也曾经多次对此予以否认。
    发言人强调指出，越南民主共和国政府强烈反对美帝国主义及其仆从国家捏造毫无根据的消息来诬蔑越南民主共和国，以掩盖它们罪恶昭彰的干涉老挝的阴谋。
    发言人说，越南民主共和国对老挝王国始终不渝的政策是：不干涉老挝的内部事务，尊重和平共处五项原则和关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，维护同老挝王国的友好关系。
