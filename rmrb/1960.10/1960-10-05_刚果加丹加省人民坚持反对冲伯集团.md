    The people of Katanga Province, Congo, Persist in Resisting the Tshombe Clique

    According to a United Nations spokesman in Elisabethville, fierce popular struggles erupted again in Manono and Mitwaba, Katanga Province, on September 30th, opposing the traitorous acts of the Tshombe clique. In Mitwaba, the people who took up arms launched a fierce offensive and clashed with the Tshombe clique's "police force." Telegraphic communication between Mitwaba and Elisabethville has been severed. The situation in Manono is currently "tense." It is reported that reinforcement troops of the "UN forces" have arrived in these two areas in order to intervene in the people's patriotic struggles.
