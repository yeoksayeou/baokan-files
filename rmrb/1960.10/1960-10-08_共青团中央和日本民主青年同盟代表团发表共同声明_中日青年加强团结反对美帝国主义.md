Xinhua News Agency, 7th - Joint Statement of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China and the Delegation of the Japan Democratic Youth League

At the invitation of the All-China Youth Federation, the delegation of the Japan Democratic Youth League visited China in September 1960, participated in the celebrations of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and visited various parts of China.

During its visit to China, the delegation of the Japan Democratic Youth League held talks with the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China in a brotherly and friendly atmosphere and issued the following statement:

At present, the construction undertakings of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries are developing at a high speed. The struggles of Asian, African, and Latin American peoples against imperialism and colonialism, for national independence and democratic freedom are surging unprecedentedly. The struggles of the people and youth of all countries in the world to defend world peace and strive for democracy and social progress have also made great progress. Today's international situation is precisely one in which the East wind prevails over the West wind.

The peaceful policies of socialist countries and their efforts to oppose imperialism and defend world peace have received warm support and welcome from the people and youth of the world. The struggles of the people and youth of the whole world to achieve peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems on the basis of the Five Principles, to strive for universal disarmament, to strive for the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and to strive for the relaxation of international tensions are increasingly closely linked with the struggles against imperialist aggression, for national independence and democratic freedom, and for social progress.

Contrary to the wishes of the people of the world to strive for world peace, national independence, democratic freedom, and social progress, U.S. imperialism is still frantically carrying out arms expansion and war preparations, strengthening aggressive military blocs, expanding military bases, plotting to interfere in and invade Cuba, actively carrying out activities to swallow up the Congo under the banner of the United Nations, and still occupying Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands of Japan, and occupying China's territory of Taiwan. These once again prove that the nature of imperialism will not change. U.S. imperialism is the common and most ferocious enemy of the people and youth of China and Japan, the people and youth of Asia, and the people and youth of the whole world. Without resolutely opposing U.S. imperialism, the oppressed nations cannot be liberated, nor can world peace be defended victoriously.

U.S. imperialism and the Japanese monopoly capital group, which is subordinate to U.S. imperialism, have revised the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," stepped up the revival of Japanese militarism, and strengthened the aggressive system hostile to socialist countries and the peoples of Asian countries. The struggle of the Japanese people and youth against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has achieved a glorious victory. The victorious struggle of the Japanese people has dealt a heavy blow to the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism, forced the Kishi cabinet to step down, prevented Eisenhower from visiting Japan, created conditions for abolishing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and opened the way for Japan to move towards peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality. This is a victory for the broad masses of the Japanese people centered on the Japanese working class, and it is also a common victory for the people and youth of the world in defending world peace and opposing imperialism. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China expresses its heartfelt congratulations on the victory of the just struggle of the Japanese people and youth, and believes that the anti-imperialist patriotic united front of the Japanese people will surely be further expanded and consolidated, and the struggle of the Japanese people will surely achieve complete victory. Both sides stated that the youth of the two countries will continue to oppose the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism, support the proposal put forward by Premier Zhou Enlai that all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions conclude a peace pact of non-aggression and make this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and further strengthen actions for its realization. Resolutely support the just struggle of the peoples of Asian, African, and Latin American countries against aggression by imperialism headed by the United States and for national independence, and resolutely support the struggle of the people and youth of all countries in the world for peace, democracy, and social progress.

Both sides stated: Support the recent struggle of the Korean youth, who have fraternal relations with the youth of China and Japan, against U.S. imperialism in South Korea, and fully support the struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. It is the natural right of Koreans residing in Japan to demand to return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the youth of the two countries resolutely oppose the obstruction of imperialists and any reactionary forces.

The delegation of the Japan Democratic Youth League believes that the current Ikeda Cabinet is actually continuing the policies of the Kishi Cabinet, on the one hand strengthening the suppression and exploitation of the Japanese people, and on the other hand adopting deceptive methods to deceive the people. It is a faithful agent of U.S. imperialism and the Japanese monopoly capital group. Therefore, it is emphasized that it is necessary to continue to strengthen the struggle to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," to strive for the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Japan and the abolition of U.S. military bases, to realize the return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan, to oppose the introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan, and to strive for the establishment of a democratic coalition government for the realization of a peaceful, independent, democratic, and neutral Japan; it is emphasized that it is necessary to resolutely smash the activities of right-wing splittists and Trotskyites who attempt to undermine the united struggle of the Japanese people. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China stated that the Chinese youth resolutely support the just struggle of the Japanese people and youth. Under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, the Japan Democratic Youth League has united the broad masses of Japanese youth and made important contributions in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Members of the Chinese Communist Youth League and Chinese youth express their respect for the heroic members of the Japan Democratic Youth League and Japanese youth.

Both sides stated: Warmly support the three political principles put forward by Premier Zhou Enlai for resolving Sino-Japanese relations. Resolutely oppose any conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and fight to achieve the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and smash policies hostile to China. To this end, it is necessary to continue to promote exchanges between the youth of China and Japan and oppose the reactionary forces that hinder exchanges between the youth of the two countries.

The delegation of the Japan Democratic Youth League stated that it firmly supports the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. It expresses its respect for the great achievements made by the Chinese people and youth under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, holding high the three red flags of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes in socialist construction.

Both sides stated: Determined to strengthen unity, support each other, encourage each other in the struggle to defend world peace and oppose imperialism, and, together with the peace-loving and progressive youth of the world, adhere to the slogan of struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and a bright future for youth put forward by the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Both sides unanimously emphasized that it is necessary to educate the younger generation with Marxist-Leninist ideology under the leadership of the Communist Parties of their respective countries, resolutely oppose modern revisionism represented by Yugoslavia, and advance bravely holding high the revolutionary banner of the Moscow Declaration. Both sides confirmed that the visit of the delegation of the Japan Democratic Youth League to China plays an important role in further strengthening the friendship and unity of the youth of the two countries, and agreed to continue to carry out specific cooperation in the future.

    新华社7日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会和日本民主青年同盟代表团的共同声明
    日本民主青年同盟代表团应中华全国青年联合会邀请，于1960年9月来中国访问，参加了中华人民共和国成立十一周年庆祝典礼，并访问了中国各地。
    日本民主青年同盟代表团在中国访问期间，同中国共产主义青年团中央委员会在兄弟般的充满着友好的气氛中举行了会谈，并发表声明如下：
    现在，苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家的建设事业都在高速度地发展。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲反对帝国主义、殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立、民主自由的斗争空前高涨。世界各国人民和青年保卫世界和平和争取民主、社会进步的斗争也有了很大的进展。今天的国际形势正是东风压倒西风。
    社会主义各国的和平政策和为反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平所做的努力，受到了世界人民和青年的热烈支持和欢迎。全世界人民和青年争取在五项原则基础上实现不同社会制度国家之间的和平共处，争取普遍裁军，争取禁止核武器，争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争正在同反对帝国主义侵略，争取和维护民族独立、民主自由和要求社会进步的斗争，日益密切地结合起来。
    同世界人民争取世界和平、民族独立、民主自由和社会进步的愿望相反，美帝国主义仍然在疯狂地进行扩军备战，加强侵略性军事集团，扩建军事基地，阴谋干涉和侵略古巴，打着联合国旗号积极进行鲸吞刚果的活动，并且仍然侵占着日本的冲绳岛、小笠原群岛，侵占着中国领土台湾。这些再次证明，帝国主义的本性是不会改变的。美帝国主义是中日两国人民和青年、是亚洲人民和青年以及全世界人民和青年的共同的最凶恶的敌人。不坚决反对美帝国主义，被压迫的民族就不能解放，同时也就不能胜利地保卫世界和平。
    美帝国主义和从属于美帝国主义的日本垄断资本集团，修改了日美“安全条约”，加紧复活日本军国主义，加强敌视社会主义各国和亚洲各国人民的侵略体系。日本人民和青年进行的反对日美“安全条约”的斗争，取得了光辉的胜利。日本人民的胜利斗争，给美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策以沉重的打击，迫使岸内阁下台，阻止了艾森豪威尔访日，创造了废除日美军事同盟条约的条件，为日本走向和平、独立、民主、中立开辟了道路。这是以日本工人阶级为中心的广大日本人民的胜利，也是全世界人民和青年保卫世界和平和反对帝国主义的斗争的共同胜利。中国共产主义青年团中央委员会表示，衷心祝贺日本人民和青年的正义斗争的胜利，并且相信日本人民的反帝爱国统一战线必将更加扩大和巩固，日本人民的斗争一定会取得完全的胜利。双方表示：两国青年将继续反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，支持周恩来总理提出的亚洲和太平洋地区的一切国家缔结一个互不侵犯的和平公约，并且使这个地区成为无核子武器区的建议，并为其实现而进一步加强行动。坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义侵略、争取和维护民族独立的正义斗争，坚决支持世界各国人民和青年争取和平、民主和社会进步的斗争。
    双方表示：支持同中日两国青年有着兄弟关系的朝鲜青年最近在南朝鲜反对美帝国主义的斗争，全面支持朝鲜人民争取和平统一祖国的斗争。旅居日本的朝鲜人要求回到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，是这些朝鲜人的当然权利，两国青年坚决反对帝国主义者和任何反动势力的阻挠。
    日本民主青年同盟代表团认为，现在池田内阁实际上是在继承岸内阁政策，一方面加强对日本人民的镇压和剥削，另一方面又采取欺骗人民的手法，它是美帝国主义和日本垄断资本集团的忠实代理人。因此，强调有必要继续加强争取废除日美“安全条约”，争取从日本撤出所有的美国军队和撤消美国军事基地，实现把冲绳、小笠原群岛归还日本的斗争，反对把核武器运进日本，为实现和平、独立、民主、中立的日本，争取当前建立一个民主联合政府而斗争；强调有必要坚决粉碎企图破坏日本人民统一斗争的右翼分裂主义者和托洛茨基分子的活动。中国共产主义青年团中央委员会表示，中国青年坚决支持日本人民和青年的正义斗争。日本民主青年同盟在日本共产党领导下，团结广大日本青年，在反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争中作出了重要贡献，中国共产主义青年团团员和中国青年对英勇的日本民主青年同盟盟员和日本青年表示敬意。
    双方表示：热烈拥护周恩来总理提出的解决中日关系的政治三原则。坚决反对任何制造“两个中国”的阴谋，为争取实现恢复中日邦交，粉碎敌视中国的政策而斗争。为此，必须继续促进中日两国青年的交流，反对阻碍两国青年交流的反动势力。
    日本民主青年同盟代表团表示，坚决支持中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争。对于中国人民和青年在中国共产党的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的三面红旗，在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大的成就表示敬意。
    双方表示：决心在保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义的斗争中，加强团结，互相支持，互相鼓舞，同全世界爱好和平和进步的青年一道，坚持世界民主青年联盟所提出的争取和平、民主、民族独立和青年美好将来的斗争口号。双方一致强调，要在本国共产党的领导下，用马克思列宁主义的思想教育青年一代，坚决反对以南斯拉夫为代表的现代修正主义，高举莫斯科宣言的革命旗帜奋勇前进。双方确认，日本民主青年同盟代表团访问中国对进一步加强两国青年的友好和团结起着重要的作用，约定今后继续进行具体的合作。
