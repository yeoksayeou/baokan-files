Republic of Mali

The governments of our two countries have decided to recognize each other.

The Republic of Mali (formerly French Sudan) is located in the heart of former French West Africa. It possesses a vast territory in the western Sahara Desert, with an area of 1,204,000 square kilometers, more than twice the size of France. It has a population of 3.7 million.

"Mali" is the name of a powerful empire in West Africa six hundred years ago. ("Mali" means hippopotamus, which in West Africa is a symbol of strength.) In the early fourteenth century, the Malian Empire stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the middle reaches of the Niger River; and the current Republic of Mali region was the center of several powerful empires in West African history. France launched a large-scale invasion of the Sudanese interior in the 1850s, and occupied all of Sudan in 1895. In 1904, Sudan was incorporated into French West Africa. For a long time, the people of Mali, together with the people of West Africa, waged heroic and unyielding struggles against colonial rule and for national independence. In order to alleviate the national independence movement of the colonial peoples, the French colonialists forcibly imposed the "French Community," a disguised form of French colonial rule, on the peoples of twelve colonies, including French West Africa and Equatorial Africa, and Madagascar, in 1959. In reality, France still controlled these countries' defense, diplomacy, and financial and economic power. Precisely for this reason, Sudan and Senegal first formed a federation after the establishment of the "Community," demanding to gradually break away from the colonial rule of the "Community," and announced their independence on June 20 this year. However, in September, Senegal suddenly announced its withdrawal from the Mali Federation. Therefore, the Sudanese Legislative Assembly unanimously passed a resolution on September 22, declaring the Republic of Mali (renamed from the Sudanese Republic) an independent and sovereign state. Earlier that day, the ruling Sudanese Union Party had passed a resolution stating that the Republic of Mali was not bound by any political ties with France.

Due to the long-term rule of the French colonialists, the people of Mali live in extreme poverty. In 1914 alone, 250,000 to 300,000 people died of starvation. The economy of the Republic of Mali is mainly based on agriculture and animal husbandry. The Senegal and Niger River basins and the oases in the desert are agricultural production areas. The main agricultural products are rice, peanuts, cotton, sisal hemp, karite (a tropical oil plant), and gum arabic. Mali's livestock accounts for a large proportion of the former French West Africa, mainly sheep, cattle, horses, and camels. (Hong) (Attached picture)

    马里共和国
    我国政府同马里共和国政府已经决定相互承认。
    马里共和国（旧称法属苏丹），位于前法属西非洲的中心。它拥有撒哈拉沙漠西部的广大地域，面积一百二十万四千平方公里，比法国大一倍多。人口三百七十万。
    “马里”是六百年前西非的一个强大帝国的名称。（“马里”是河马的意思，在西非，它是力量的象征。）在十四世纪初期，马里帝国的版图从大西洋一直延伸到尼日尔河的中游；而目前的马里共和国地区则是历史上西非几个强盛帝国的中心。法国在十九世纪五十年代大举侵入苏丹内地，1895年占领全部苏丹。1904年苏丹并入法属西非洲。长期以来，马里人民同西非人民一道为反抗殖民统治、争取民族独立，进行了英勇不屈的斗争。为了缓和殖民地人民的民族独立运动，法国殖民者在1959年把“法兰西共同体”这一法国殖民统治的变相形式强加在法属西非和赤道非洲以及马尔加什等十二个殖民地人民的身上。实际上，法国仍然控制着这些国家的国防、外交和财政经济大权。正因如此，苏丹和塞内加尔在“共同体”建立以后首先结成联邦，要求逐步摆脱“共同体”的殖民统治，并于今年6月20日宣布独立。但9月间，塞内加尔突然宣布退出马里联邦。因此，苏丹立法议会在9月22日一致通过决议，宣布（由苏丹共和国改名的）马里共和国为一个独立和主权的国家。而在当天早些时候，执政的苏丹联盟党曾通过决议说，马里共和国不受它同法国任何政治联系的约束。
    由于法国殖民者的长期统治，马里人民生活极端困苦。只1914年，就有二十五万到三十万人民死于饥饿。马里共和国的经济以农牧业为主。塞内加尔河和尼日尔河流域以及沙漠中的绿洲是农业生产地带。农产品主要有大米、花生、棉花、西沙尔麻、卡里特（一种热带油脂植物）和阿拉伯树胶等。马里的牲畜在前法属西非占的比重很大，主要有羊、牛、马和骆驼。　（洪）（附图片）
