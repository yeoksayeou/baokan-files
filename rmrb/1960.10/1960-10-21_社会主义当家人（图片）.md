At the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant's final assembly workshop, there is an old worker named Wang Jincheng who consistently loves state property, is frugal and thrifty in everything he does, and regards every blade of grass and tree as a treasure. In his spare time, people often see him rummaging around the factory, picking up waste cotton, small parts, small iron pieces, coal lumps, etc. He notices everything, and he even sifts through the garbage swept out of the workshop to pick out metal filings from the soil. He also tries every possible means to turn these useless things into useful ones. Because he cares for the state's property, no matter how small, day after day, the workers call him a socialist "old miser" and he has been repeatedly named an advanced producer at the factory level. Now he has become a pacesetter in the increased production and economy campaign.

    (1) Wang Jincheng is sifting through the garbage swept out of the workshop to pick out metal filings mixed in the soil.
    (2) Wang Jincheng (left) puts the "waste" he has picked up into his "small warehouse" after sorting it. Young workers She Yaozong (right) and Zhang Hui (center) were doing technical innovation and were short of parts, so they found them in Teacher Wang's "treasure bowl".
    (3) For more than a year, Wang Jincheng (right) has not only not received a single piece of new cotton waste, but has also washed many pieces of waste cotton waste that he picked up for the workshop to use.
    (4) Wang Jincheng's noble style of being thrifty everywhere and loving the factory as his home has motivated the workers in the entire workshop. The young workers in the chassis group manufactured an oil cotton waste cleaning machine to clean and process used waste cotton waste, saving expenses for the country.

    社会主义当家人
    在北京汽车制造厂总装配车间里，有一个一贯热爱国家财产、处处勤俭节约、把一草一木视作珍宝的老工人王金城。业余时间，人们常常看到他在厂里到处翻翻拣拣，废棉丝、小零件、小铁块、煤块等什么东西他都看在眼里，连车间里清扫出来的垃圾他也要清筛一遍，拣出土里的金属屑。他还千方百计地把这些东西变无用为有用。由于他常年如一日地爱护国家点滴财物，工人们把他叫作社会主义“老财迷”，曾多次被评为厂级先进生产者。现在他又成为增产节约运动中的一名标兵。
    （一）王金城正在从车间里清扫出来的垃圾中筛拣混在土里的金属屑。
    （二）王金城（左）把拣来的“废物”分类放到“小仓库”里。青年工人佘耀宗（右）和张慧（中）搞技术革新，缺少零件，结果在王老师傅的“聚宝盆”里找到了。
    （三）一年多来，王金城（右）不但没领过一块新棉丝，还清洗了许多拣来的废棉丝，供车间使用。
    （四）王金城处处节约、爱厂如家的高尚风格，带动了全车间的工人。底盘小组的青年工人制造一台油棉丝清洗机，用来清洗和处理用过的废棉丝，为国家节省开支。
