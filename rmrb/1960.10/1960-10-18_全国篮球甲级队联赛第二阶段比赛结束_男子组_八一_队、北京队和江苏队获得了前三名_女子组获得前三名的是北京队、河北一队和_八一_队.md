Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th. The second stage of the 1960 National Basketball League A Division Shenyang competition zone (finals) concluded entirely on the 16th. The "August 1st" team, Beijing team, and Jiangsu team won the top three spots in the men's division. The Beijing team, Hebei First team, and "August 1st" team won the top three spots in the women's division.

    In the final day of competition, each team was full of fighting spirit and went all out, resulting in exciting and intense battles. In seven of the twelve matches, the scores differed by less than ten points, and in five of those, the difference was less than five points. The "August 1st" men's team, which defeated the Beijing team by four points on the 15th to win the men's division championship, lost to the Sichuan men's team by four points (88-92) in their final match on the 16th. While this loss did not affect the "August 1st" team's championship status, it broke their undefeated record since the beginning of the league, meaning that none of the twenty-four men's and women's teams participating in the second stage of the Shenyang competition zone maintained a perfect record. In this match, the two sides fought fiercely for forty minutes, tying at seventy-nine, and only after five minutes of overtime was the victory decided.

    The Sichuan men's team, the champion of the first National Games last year, lost three matches at the beginning of this final stage, but they performed better in the last few matches, finally becoming the only team to defeat the strong "August 1st" team this time. However, because they lost three matches in the first stage preliminary round, they only achieved seventh place in this league.

    The Beijing team, runner-up in the men's division this time, won a hard-fought victory of seventy-seven to seventy-six against the Liaoning men's team, which was sixth in the first National Games last year, in their final match on the 16th.

    The last six matches in the women's division were also very intense. The champion Beijing team only won by ten points against the Liaoning women's team, which did not qualify for the National Games basketball finals last year (65-55). The difference in scores between the third-place "August 1st" women's team and the Sichuan women's team, which was fifth in the National Games last year, was even closer, at fifty-seven to fifty-three. The newly emerging Anhui team won again on the 16th, defeating its last opponent, the Yunnan women's team, which was eighth in the first National Games, by fifty-seven to fifty-three. Before this, the Anhui women's team had also defeated the Guangdong team, which was sixth in the first National Games, and the Shanghai First team, which was seventh.

    This year's National Basketball League A Division is being held in two stages. The first stage of the divisional preliminary round was held in Changchun, Harbin, and Shenyang in September, with a total of forty-six teams (twenty-three men's teams and twenty-three women's teams) participating. The twenty-four men's and women's teams that achieved the top four positions in the three competition zones began participating in the second stage finals held in Shenyang from October 6th, competing for the top twelve places for men and women. The twenty-two men's and women's teams that achieved fourth place or lower are currently participating in the second stage finals in Changchun, competing for places from thirteenth onwards.

    The results of the Shenyang competition zone finals show that the technical level of each team has improved generally. In the ninety-six matches, the scores differed by no more than ten points in fifty-four matches. Among these, there were thirty-two matches where the difference was no more than five points, and six matches with seven overtime periods. The scores for the sixth-place Shanghai First Team, the seventh-place Sichuan Team, and the eighth-place Liaoning Team in the men's division were all sixteen points; the scores for the fifth-place Guangdong Team, the sixth-place Shanghai First Team, and the seventh-place Jiangsu Team in the women's division were also equal (seventeen points). In this situation of evenly matched opponents, the final rankings could only be determined by the net score of each team in the matches.

    全国篮球甲级队联赛第二阶段比赛结束
    男子组“八一”队、北京队和江苏队获得了前三名
    女子组获得前三名的是北京队、河北一队和“八一”队
    新华社沈阳17日电　1960年全国篮球甲级队联赛第二阶段沈阳竞赛区的比赛（决赛），16日全部结束。男子组“八一”队、北京队和江苏队获得了前三名。女子组获得前三名的是北京队、河北一队和“八一”队。
    在最后一天的比赛中，各队斗志昂扬、全力以赴，使比赛中又出现了精采、紧张的争夺场面。十二场比赛有七场双方得分相差不到十分，其中五场相差不到五分。在15日以四分的优势战胜北京队获得男子组冠军的“八一”男子队，16日在最后一场中却以四分之差（八十八比九十二）败给了四川男子队。这一败虽然不影响“八一”队的冠军地位，但却打破了他们从联赛开始以来一直保持的不败纪录，使参加第二阶段沈阳竞赛区比赛的二十四个男、女队中，没有一个队保持全胜。在这场比赛中，双方经过四十分钟激战竟打成七十九平，延长五分钟再战，才分出胜负。
    去年第一届全国运动会冠军四川男子队，在这次决赛之初曾败了三场，但他们在最后几场比赛中打得比较出色，终于成为这次唯一击败实力坚强的“八一”队的一个队。可是由于他们在第一阶段预赛中输了三场，因而在这次联赛中只获得第七名。
    这次联赛男子组亚军北京队，16日最后一场经过艰苦奋战，才以七十七比七十六战胜去年第一届全运会第六名辽宁男子队。
    女子组的最后六场比赛也很紧张。冠军北京队只赢了去年没有获得全运会篮球决赛权的辽宁女子队十分（六十五比五十五）。第三名“八一”女子队赢去年全运会第五名四川女子队的比数更接近，是五十七比五十三。新军安徽队16日再次告捷，以五十七比五十三击败了最后一个对手——第一届全运会第八名云南女子队。在这以前，安徽女子队还分别挫败了第一届全运会第六名广东队、第七名上海一队。
    今年的全国篮球甲级队联赛是分两个阶段进行的。第一阶段分区预赛9月间分别在长春、哈尔滨和沈阳三个竞赛区举行，共有四十六个队（男女各二十三队）参加。三个竞赛区获得前四名的二十四个男女队，从10月6日开始参加在沈阳举行的第二阶段决赛，争夺男女前十二名的名次。获得第四名以下名次的二十二个男女队，目前正在长春参加第二阶段争夺第十三名以下名次的决赛。
    沈阳竞赛区决赛的结果表明，各队的技术水平又有了普遍提高。九十六场比赛中，双方得分相差不超过十分的就占五十四场。其中有三十二场相差不超过五分，有六场七次延长决胜期。男子组第六名上海一队、第七名四川队、第八名辽宁队的积分都是十六分；女子组第五名广东队、第六名上海一队、第七名江苏队的积分也是相等的（十七分）。在这种棋逢对手、将遇良才的情况下，最后只有从各队在比赛中净胜分数的多少来决定他们的名次。
