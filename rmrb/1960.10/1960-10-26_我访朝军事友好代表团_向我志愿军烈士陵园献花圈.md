Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 25th -- The Military Friendship Delegation of the People's Republic of China, led by He Long, Vice-Chairman of the National Defense Council and Vice-Premier of the State Council, and Luo Ruiqing, Vice-Premier of the State Council and Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, accompanied by senior generals of the Korean People's Army, made a special trip from Pyongyang today to lay wreaths at the Cemetery of the Chinese People's Volunteers near the former headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

The weather was clear and sunny today. The delegation was constantly welcomed by the Korean people along the way. Upon arriving at the former headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the delegation was greeted by local party and government leaders, more than 5,000 people, and officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army lining the streets. Along the approximately three-li road, the welcoming crowd waved the national flags of China and North Korea and bouquets, warmly cheering the delegates. The welcoming crowd also repeatedly shouted: "Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long live the friendship between the people of North Korea and China!" In the welcoming ranks were Korean elders in their sixties and seventies and "Amahni" carrying children on their backs. When they saw their Chinese relatives, they were so excited that their eyes were filled with tears, and they cheered enthusiastically.

After the band played the national anthems of China and North Korea, the delegation placed wreaths in front of the cemetery of martyrs amid mournful music, and then stood in silent tribute for a long time. In front of the cemetery, wreaths offered to the martyrs of the Chinese People's Volunteers by the Korean people and local party and government leading organs had already been placed.

After laying the wreaths, the delegation walked around the cemetery of martyrs and paid their respects. The cemetery was clean and beautiful, surrounded by red leaves. Inside the cemetery, the Korean people had already offered bouquets of flowers on the tombs of the martyrs between the verdant pines and cypresses.

The delegation also visited the former headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The items and wooden beds used by the Volunteers' headquarters were still in their original places. Delegation members, General Yang Yong, former commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and General Wang Ping, political commissar, were particularly excited and felt a sense of kinship when they saw the offices and living quarters they had once lived in. General Yang Yong walked to a lilac tree he had personally planted and said, "It's grown so big now."

The delegation and local party, government, and military leaders had lunch together in the conference hall of the former Volunteers' headquarters. During the meal, General Luo Ruiqing, General Yang Yong, and General Wang Ping specially proposed a toast to Comrade Jin Dinghao, who guards the Cemetery of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

After lunch, the delegation presented the local troops of the Korean People's Army with a silk banner inscribed with "The militant friendship between the Chinese and North Korean armies cemented with blood will last forever," and presented gifts to local party and government leaders, the head of the local garrison of the People's Army, and Comrade Jin Dinghao, the cemetery guard.

The delegation returned to Pyongyang at 5:30 p.m.

    我访朝军事友好代表团
    向我志愿军烈士陵园献花圈
    新华社平壤25日电　由中国国防委员会副主席、国务院副总理贺龙元帅和国务院副总理、中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿大将率领的中华人民共和国访朝军事友好代表团，在朝鲜人民军高级将领陪同下，今天从平壤专程到前中国人民志愿军总部驻地附近的中国人民志愿军烈士陵园献花圈。
    今天天气晴朗，风和日丽。代表团沿路不断受到朝鲜人民的欢迎。代表团在到达前中国人民志愿军总部驻地时，受到当地党政领导人、五千多名群众和朝鲜人民军官兵的夹道欢迎。在长约三华里的道路上，欢迎群众高举着中朝两国国旗和花束，向代表们热烈欢呼。欢迎群众还不断高呼：“金日成元帅万岁！”“毛泽东主席万岁！”“朝中两国人民的友谊万岁！”在欢迎行列里有六、七十岁的朝鲜父老和背着孩子的阿妈妮。他们见到中国亲人时，激动得眼里含着泪花，热烈欢呼。
    乐队高奏中朝两国国歌后，代表团在哀乐声中把花圈安放在烈士陵园前，然后，久久默哀致敬。陵园前，已经安放着朝鲜人民和当地党政领导机关敬献给中国人民志愿军烈士的花圈。
    代表团献花圈后，绕行陵园一周，瞻仰了烈士陵园。陵园整洁清秀，四周红叶彤彤。陵园内，在苍松翠柏之间的各位烈士墓座上，朝鲜人民早已献上一束束鲜花。
    代表团还参观访问了前中国人民志愿军总部驻地。志愿军总部所使用过的物品和木床还在原来地方安放着。代表团团员、前中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将、政治委员王平上将见到自己曾经居住过的办公室和住室，格外感到兴奋和亲切。杨勇上将走到他亲手栽植的一株丁香花树旁，他说：“现在长这么大了。”
    代表团和当地党、政、军领导人在前志愿军总部的会议厅里共进了午餐。席间，罗瑞卿大将、杨勇上将、王平上将特意向守护志愿军烈士陵园的金定镐同志祝酒。
    午餐后，代表团赠送给朝鲜人民军当地驻军官兵一幅写有“中朝两国军队以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊万古长青”的锦旗，并向当地党政领导人、人民军当地驻军首长和守陵的金定镐同志赠送了礼品。
    下午五时半，代表团返回平壤。
