Build a Small Joint Factory for Comprehensive Utilization of Coal
    Let Coal Contribute a Hundred Treasures to Agricultural Technological Transformation
    Daweijia Commune Produces Important Materials Such as Diesel, Fertilizer, Coke, and Pig Iron Itself
    (Our Newspaper News) The Daweijia People's Commune in Jin County, Lushun-Dalian City, Liaoning Province, has built a joint factory centered on the comprehensive utilization of coal. This small joint factory, with only twenty-odd small factory buildings and more than one hundred and twenty employees, can produce many kinds of products. It uses a coal dry distillation square furnace as its core and has established tar processing, iron smelting, fertilizer, machinery processing, cement, plastics, grain processing, power generation, and other workshops. Since it was put into production in October last year, it has produced more than twenty kinds of products using coal as raw material. Most of these products are urgently needed materials for agricultural technological transformation, such as coke, diesel, gasoline, fertilizer, gas, and so on. They also use coke and gas to smelt iron and make iron, and send the gas to the staff canteens and the canteen of a production team one kilometer away, so that the canteens have achieved gasification. In addition, they have trial-produced several pesticides and are preparing to use gas to generate electricity. Many people who have seen this joint factory say: Regions with suitable conditions, as long as they set up such a small joint factory for comprehensive utilization of coal, can obtain a large number of important materials needed for agricultural technological transformation.
    The central equipment of this joint factory is two coal comprehensive utilization square furnaces. It can produce coke, tar, and gas. It is a brick structure five meters high, with a furnace volume of more than six tons. A square furnace can process eight to fifteen tons of coal per day. It can use lump coal, or it can use inferior coal, crushed coal, etc. for dry distillation. The temperature in the furnace can reach about 900 degrees Celsius, so that better coke and more gas can be obtained, and the oil extraction efficiency of tar is also higher, reaching 80%—90% or more. It is relatively easy to build this kind of square furnace. It can be built with red bricks, refractory bricks, cement, asbestos ash (which can be replaced by furnace ash) and a small amount of steel, as well as ordinary exhaust fans and blowers. The construction is also very simple. The operating technology is easy to master, and it can be learned in a week. A class of four people can operate it.
    The small square furnace is like a vigorously vital heart in the joint factory. Its pipelines are like blood vessels, leading to various workshops. It constantly flows tar to the tar processing workshop, extracts ammonia from the gas to supply the fertilizer workshop, and the gas it generates is transported to each workshop as fuel through pipelines. The small blast furnace, more than one hundred meters away from the square furnace, also has a ceramic pipe with a diameter of five inches connected to the square furnace, and the gas produced by the square furnace can be directly sent to the small blast furnace to smelt iron.
    Although the Daweijia Commune had a lot of iron ore in the past, it could not smelt iron due to lack of fuel. With the square furnace, the Daweijia Commune can produce coke and gas by itself, and the fuel supply problem of the small blast furnace is solved. When the square furnace is in normal production, it can produce 2,500 tons of coke annually, which is enough for the commune's blast furnace to use as fuel. Seven months after the Daweijia Commune's square furnace was put into production, it produced 945 tons of coke. In addition to supplying the needs of the commune's small blast furnace and machinery processing workshop, it also supported some coke to the Thirty Mile Fort and Twenty Mile Fort Communes in Jin County. Since the establishment of the Daweijia Commune Joint Factory, it has produced twelve tons of pig iron. Using these pig iron and scrap iron supported by the city, the machinery workshop of the joint factory has manufactured more than 30 sets of machines such as seeders, threshers, and water pumps. This factory has also manufactured a complete set of pulleys, winches, and soil rails for the commune's two small reservoir projects, which greatly accelerated the progress of the project.
    The Daweijia Commune Joint Factory has produced a considerable amount of gasoline, diesel, pesticides, fertilizers, and other products. The diesel produced by this factory has been identified by the Dalian Diesel Engine Factory as being of good quality. Now, this joint factory produces 400 kilograms of diesel per day, which can meet the needs of the commune's existing 28 diesel engines with surplus. The ammonia contained in the gas produced by the square furnace can be recovered with waste sulfuric acid to produce ammonium sulfate. This fertilizer has already played a role in the commune's agricultural production. The higher phenols extracted from tar can be made into "6033" and "0416" pesticides. They are very effective in killing cotton pests such as red spider mites, and are also very effective in treating livestock scabies.
    The Daweijia Commune Coal Comprehensive Utilization Joint Factory is a product of the Great Leap Forward and the crystallization of vigorous support for agriculture from scientific research departments and industrial departments. During the Great Leap Forward in Steel in 1958, four small blast furnaces were built here, with a surplus of ore but a shortage of coke. The commune had thirteen diesel engines and two tractors, which also needed a lot of diesel. After the autumn of that year, Party Secretary Zhu Yongfu and the Party Branch Secretary of the iron smelting plant went to Jinzhou Town to visit a small square furnace of the Dalian Gas Company. They saw that the small square furnace produced both good coke and tar, which greatly inspired them. After several discussions, the commune Party committee decided to set up a joint factory centered on the square furnace. The Coal Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Petroleum Research Institute, the Lushun-Dalian City Heavy Industry Bureau, the Dalian Cement Factory, and other units immediately gave strong support. After the factory was put into production, scientific researchers from the Coal Research Institute and the Petroleum Research Institute also continuously carried out technological innovation and technological revolution together with the commune members. Now, this small joint factory combining indigenous and foreign methods has gradually moved towards mechanized and semi-mechanized production. (Contributed by Lushun-Dalian Daily)

    建个综合利用煤炭的小联合厂
    让煤炭为农业技术改造献百宝
    大魏家公社自己生产柴油、化肥、焦炭、生铁等重要物资
    本报讯　辽宁省旅大市金县大魏家人民公社建成了一座以煤炭综合利用为中心的联合工厂。这个只有二十多间小厂房、一百二十多名职工的小联合工厂，能生产许多种产品。它以煤炭干馏方型炉为核心，建立了焦油加工、炼铁、化肥、机械加工、水泥、塑料、粮食加工、发电等车间。从去年10月投入生产以来，它已经以煤炭为原料，生产了二十多种产品。这些产品大部分都是农业技术改造中所迫切需要的物资，如焦炭、柴油、汽油、化肥、煤气等等。他们还利用焦炭和煤气来炼铁和化铁，并将煤气送到职工食堂和一公里外的一个生产小队的食堂，使食堂实现了煤气化。此外，他们试制了几种农药，还准备利用煤气发电。许多看过这个联合工厂的人都说：有条件的地区，只要设立这样一个煤炭综合利用的小联合厂，就能得到农业技术改造所需要的大量重要物资。
    这个联合厂的中心设备是两座煤炭综合利用方型炉。它可以生产焦炭、焦油、煤气。它是一个高五米的砖砌体，炉内容量六吨多。一座方型炉每日可以处理八吨到十五吨煤炭。它可以用块煤，也可以用劣质煤、碎煤等进行干馏。炉内温度可以达到九百度左右，这样就可以得到较好的焦炭和较多的煤气，同时焦油的采油效率也较高，能达80％—90％以上。建造这种方型炉比较容易，用红砖、耐火砖、水泥、石棉灰（可以用炉灰代替）和少量钢材，以及普通的排送机、鼓风机各一台，就可以建成。施工也很简单。操作技术容易掌握，一周即可学会，一班有四个人就可以操纵。
    小小的方型炉像联合厂中的生命力旺盛的心脏。它的管道像血管，通向各个车间。它不断地流出焦油供给焦油加工车间，从煤气中提出氨供给化肥车间，它产生的煤气通过管道输送到每个车间当燃料。距离方型炉一百多米的小高炉，也有一条直径五寸的陶瓷管道和方型炉连接，方型炉产生的煤气能直接送到小高炉内炼铁。
    大魏家公社过去虽有很多铁矿石，但因没有燃料不能炼铁。有了方型炉，大魏家公社自己能产焦、产煤气，小高炉的燃料供应问题就解决了。方型炉正常生产时，每年可产焦炭二千五百吨，供一个公社的高炉做燃料，可以自给有余。大魏家公社的方型炉投入生产后七个月，就生产了九百四十五吨焦炭，除供应本社小高炉和机械加工车间的需要外，还支援了金县三十里堡和二十里堡两个公社一部分焦炭。大魏家公社联合厂建立以来，已经生产了十二吨生铁。利用这些生铁和城市支援的废铁，联合厂的机械车间已经造出了播种机、脱谷机和水泵等三十多套机械。这个厂还为公社两座小型水库工程制造了全套滑车、卷扬机和土铁轨，使工程进度大大加快。
    大魏家公社联合厂已经生产数量可观的汽油、柴油和农药、化肥等产品。这个厂生产的柴油经过大连柴油机厂鉴定，质量良好。现在，这个联合厂日产柴油四百公斤，可以满足公社现有二十八台柴油机的需要还有余。方型炉产生的煤气中所含的氨，可以用废硫酸洗涤回收硫酸氨。这种肥料已经在公社农业生产中发挥了作用。从焦油中提取的高级酚，可以制成“六○三三”和“○四一六”农药。它们对棉花害虫红蜘蛛的杀伤力很强，治牲畜癞病效果也很好。
    大魏家公社煤炭综合利用联合厂是大跃进的产物，是科学研究部门、工业部门大力支援农业的结晶。1958年大办钢铁时，这里建起了四座小高炉，矿石有余，焦炭不足；公社有十三台柴油机、两台拖拉机，也需要大量柴油。这年秋后，党委书记朱永富和炼铁厂支部书记、工人一起到金州镇参观了大连煤气公司的一座小方型炉，看到小方型炉既出好焦炭，又能出焦油，对他们启发很大。公社党委经过数次讨论，决定兴办以方型炉为中心的联合厂。中国科学院煤炭研究室、石油研究所、旅大市重工业局、大连水泥厂等单位，立即大力给予支援。工厂投入生产以后，煤炭研究室和石油研究所的科学研究人员还同公社社员一起不断进行技术革新和技术革命。现在，这个土洋结合的小型联合厂，已经逐步走向机械化和半机械化生产了。（旅大日报供稿）
