    **Qingdao Hastens Production of Winter Small Commodities**

    The Qingdao Native Produce and Waste Products Company is diligently arranging the supply of daily-use industrial products and small commodities for winter. After promptly understanding the demand for daily-use industrial products related to winter heating, cooking, and hygiene, they have contacted more than 60 production units, including processing plants under the Handicraft Industry Bureau and factories and groups in various communes, to ensure the full implementation of the production of 44 types of daily-use industrial products and 15 types of small commodities planned. They also actively assist industrial departments in resolving raw material issues. In early October, they allocated timber, bamboo, nails, and other raw materials to processing plants. To better meet the public's demand for winter small commodities, they also actively cleared warehouses and made every effort to explore sources of goods from all aspects.

    **Technological Innovation Increases Gasoline Production**

    Workers at the various refineries under the Chongqing Chemical Industry Company in Sichuan Province are actively taking measures to improve equipment and expand production capacity in order to produce more gasoline and diesel to support the transportation sector in transporting more steel and other materials. Li Dexin, a stoker at the Jiangbei Refinery, created an advanced operating method to increase furnace temperature, shortening the oil extraction time from the original 12 hours to 4 hours, thereby increasing the oil extraction rate. After this experience was promoted throughout the plant, the average daily crude oil production in the first 10 days of October increased by more than double compared to September. Workers at the Chongqing Coking Plant worked hard for 13 days to achieve a comprehensive innovation in petroleum processing, shortening the production cycle from the original 120 hours to 30 hours, increasing the crude oil recovery rate by more than 10%, and increasing the refinery output by about five times.

    **Vigorously Carry Out Product Revolution to Achieve High-Quality, High-Yield, and Multi-Variety Production**

    Workers at the Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory in Sichuan Province are vigorously carrying out product revolutions, focusing on improving product quality and saving raw materials. From January to September, 80% of the factory's main products have been reformed in terms of design and processing technology, reducing the scrap rate from 1.11% to 0.94%. The variety of main products has increased fourfold compared to last year, and costs have decreased by 16.8% compared to last year. In August and September alone, the factory saved more than 180 tons of steel through product revolution.

    **Jian'ou Coal Mine Reduces Manpower and Increases Production**

    The Jian'ou Coal Mine in Fujian Province has reasonably organized its labor force, giving full play to the role of each laborer, and has vigorously engaged in technological revolution, innovating coal mining technology, and accelerating the progress of the coal mining cycle, achieving manpower reduction and increased production. In August, with a reduction of more than 400 laborers, the production plan was overfulfilled by 4.29%. In September, coal production increased by 16% compared to August.

    **Zhao Gezhuang Mine's Thousand Model Workers Vigorously Help the Backward**

    In order to win a large-scale, high-yield harvest of coal, the Party Committee of the Zhao Gezhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine in Hebei Province organized more than 1,200 model workers to "settle down" in backward teams, working with the workers of these teams to tackle the key production issues. In a short period of time, 60% of the mine's backward teams caught up with the production level of the advanced teams. The average daily output of the entire mine from October 1st to 16th increased by 4.43% compared to September.

    **Harbin Steel Rolling Plant Achieves Leaps in Output and Quality**

    In order to seize high quality and high output, workers at the Harbin Steel Rolling Plant in Heilongjiang Province extensively launched a steel rolling production competition to master the production progress on time and calculate the output of steel per second, pushing production to a new peak. Through the competition in the first 10 days of October, the plant achieved a total of 55 technological innovation projects. The various types of steel rolled increased by 62.5% compared to the same period in September, and the rework rate of steel was reduced to 2%.
