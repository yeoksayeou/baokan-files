Xinhua News Agency, 7th: According to TASS, New York: Khrushchev delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly on October 1, 1960, regarding the issue of restoring China's representation in the United Nations. The full text is as follows:

Mr. President! Distinguished Representatives!

The Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to submit the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations for discussion by the General Assembly.

Undoubtedly, the artificial prevention of the People's Republic of China from participating in the activities of the United Nations has brought significant losses to our organization, greatly reduced the scope of the United Nations' activities, hindered the discussion of international issues that require the collective efforts of all countries to resolve, and, in fact, made it impossible to effectively discuss extremely important issues.

I would like to particularly emphasize that we are talking about restoring the rights of a major country which, according to the UN Charter, is a founding member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council. However, it has not yet been able to occupy the seat that rightfully belongs to it, participate in the work of UN agencies, and make its contribution to the activities of the United Nations. It is highly abnormal for the great Chinese people, who make up a quarter of the world's population, not to have their representatives in this organization (whose mission is to be the broadest international forum and whose foundation is the principle of universal representation of all countries in the world).

Countries with different social systems and forms of government are represented in the United Nations. It should reflect the true face of the modern world like a mirror. However, in the current situation, here, in the United Nations, without the representation of China, the true picture of the modern world is not reflected, and it is distorted. Every sane person knows that the People's Republic of China is a great country united by all the Chinese people, and the government of the People's Republic of China exercises all state power over the entire territory of China, except for a few islands where the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, defeated by the Chinese people, are temporarily entrenched under the cover of American warships.

The People's Republic of China has gained widespread international recognition and has established normal diplomatic relations with thirty-four countries. The international connections of the People's China are rapidly expanding. The People's China's trade and cultural ties now encompass almost the entire world.

The Chinese people are engaged in great labor to transform a formerly economically backward country into an advanced socialist industrial power. Therefore, it is deeply concerned about peace and advocates peaceful international economic and cultural cooperation.

China was one of the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in 1954. The government of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly put forward proposals aimed at easing international tensions in the Far East and around the world. The People's Republic of China has made significant contributions to the cause of peaceful resolution of the situations in Indochina, Korea, and other regions of the Asian continent. The Chinese government actively advocates the establishment of a peace zone in Asia and a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Pacific region. It suggests that countries along the Asian and Pacific coasts, including the United States, conclude a treaty of mutual non-aggression and peace.

Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China emphasized again in a speech in Beijing on August 1 this year that the government of the People's Republic of China follows the policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. He said, "We are willing to achieve peaceful coexistence not only with Asian countries and Arab countries, but also with European countries and countries in other regions of the world." He continued, "We advocate that countries along the Asian and Pacific coasts, including the United States, sign a treaty of mutual non-aggression and peace, and build this entire region into a region without nuclear weapons."

The policies of the Chinese government convincingly demonstrate that it firmly stands on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and supports the basic purposes and principles of the United Nations with concrete actions, making significant efforts to expand international cooperation and strengthen peace and friendship between peoples.

Why has the United Nations not yet resolved such an important and extremely clear issue as the representation of People's China in the United Nations? The main reason is that the United States is unwilling to do so. It is doing everything possible to prevent the People's Republic of China from occupying its legitimate seat in the United Nations.

At this session of the United Nations General Assembly, many heads of state and government have stated very clearly that the situation created by the absence of representatives of the great Chinese people in the United Nations is absolutely intolerable. The U.S. government pursues a policy of hostility and aggression towards People's China. As early as 1950, the United States carried out aggression against China, forcibly occupied Taiwan Island, and continues to use Taiwan Island as a base for military provocations against the People's Republic of China, continuing to increase the so-called "deterrent force" in the Far East, and spending billions of dollars to assist the Chiang Kai-shek elements in preparing new military provocations.

The United States has established many military bases along China's borders. In the past year and a half, the United States has conducted more than forty large-scale military exercises in the Far East, almost half of which were conducted in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, and American generals do not conceal that these exercises are directed against the People's Republic of China.

At the same time, senior American political figures talk nonsense about the "aggressiveness" of the People's Republic of China. They often mention the illegal resolution on declaring China an "aggressor" that the United States forced on the United Nations General Assembly in the past. By the way, it is appropriate to ask such a question about the above-mentioned resolution: Whose troops are still stationed in Korea now? If the State Department is forgetful, then it can be reminded that there have long been no Chinese People's Volunteers there, while American troops continue to occupy South Korea.

The United States government's attempt to revive such a political corpse as Chiang Kai-shek and his corrupt regime, which was overthrown by the Chinese people, only poisons the international situation in the Far East.

Distinguished representatives! The United Nations has been discussing the issue of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations for more than ten years. Every time representatives of various countries ascend this podium, they talk about their government's attitude towards this important issue. In discussing this issue, countries are basically divided into two factions each time. Some countries follow the logic of actual events, defend the legitimate rights of the great Chinese people, and state straightforwardly and resolutely: it is time to eliminate this extremely unreasonable phenomenon in history, and suggest that the government of the People's Republic of China send its delegation to join us in the United Nations and participate in all activities of the United Nations.

Representatives of other countries, through various excuses, evade making a just decision, follow the U.S. government in one way or another, and obstruct the United Nations from passing a resolution on restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

The arguments used by the U.S. government against People's China are only believed by those who follow American politicians. As early as eleven years ago, American politicians suffered a defeat in China due to the collapse of the traitorous Kuomintang regime and the victory of the People's China's revolution.

Everyone knows very well that the American ruling circles did not recognize the Soviet Union for sixteen years, simply because our people eliminated the bourgeois-landlord system and achieved the great socialist revolution. The Soviet people, of course, did not ask these or those politicians in the United States for permission on this matter. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, did the same.

We have no doubt that one day American politicians will show a more sober attitude towards People's China, rather than the hostility they are showing everywhere now, and then they will respect this great country with due regard.

As long as the People's Republic of China does not have its legitimate seat in the United Nations, conditions cannot be created for effective negotiations and solutions to the disarmament issue. Because even if a disarmament agreement is reached, will such an agreement be effective without China's participation? You must know that even with a disarmament agreement, the United States will say that because China did not participate, this agreement cannot be implemented. However, they are obstructing the People's Republic of China from participating in the United Nations in every possible way.

Distinguished representatives, we firmly demand that you break this vicious cycle. Without China, there can be no disarmament. Without China, the United Nations cannot function normally.

The United States and some other Western countries, feeling that it is absurd that the Chiang Kai-shek elements "represent" China in the United Nations, and worried about the fate of the Kuomintang running dogs, are trying to drag out the notorious "two Chinas" proposition. However, the "two Chinas" proposition is essentially a poorly disguised subversive act aimed at dismembering the territory of great China and taking away one part of it—Taiwan Province. This attempt is no secret to anyone.

It has long been clear that the provocative plan to create "two Chinas" is bound to fail. The sooner some politicians in the United States understand this, the more beneficial it will be to the cause of world peace.

If anyone thinks that it is primarily the People's Republic of China that needs to restore China's rights in the United Nations, that is not correct. These gentlemen are mistaken. If we correctly understand the mission of our organization as a universal organization uniting all countries, then it is difficult to say who needs to restore China's rights in the United Nations more—China itself, or the United Nations, which should be the broadest and most representative international organization? This organization needs such a large country and such a strong country as the People's Republic of China to have its representative in the United Nations and actively participate in the activities of the United Nations.

Precisely for this reason, the Soviet delegation proposes that the issue of restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations be discussed and resolved at the beginning of the General Assembly session as an important and urgent issue.

Representatives, please allow me now to respond to the statement of the American representative. The American representative said that it is necessary to continue to pursue the current bankrupt policy towards the People's Republic of China. He proposed rejecting the Soviet proposal to restore China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.

The American representative here used Comrade Peng Zhen, the mayor of Beijing, as an excuse. I am very familiar with Comrade Peng Zhen. If you met him, you would understand that he is not at all as some people here say. He is a very good person who is respected at home. The American representative's excuse is that Comrade Peng Zhen called the United States an imperialist country. However, gentlemen, is this a discovery? (Applause) The whole world knows that the richest and most imperialistic country supporting the colonial system is the United States. All the sparrows on the roof are chirping and discussing this. (Applause) And the American representative is indignant at Comrade Peng Zhen's words. What a grievance! This is like a noble lady pretending to be a virgin, but she has given birth to at least a dozen children. (Laughter, applause)

The American representative also said that Comrade Peng Zhen mentioned that Mr. Hammarskjöld implemented policies in the Congo that were beneficial to American imperialism and colonialism. Is this also news? Mr. Hammarskjöld himself knows better than Peng Zhen whose policies he pursued in the Congo. He is a loyal servant of monopoly capital, and he represents the interests of those countries in the United Nations that pursue predatory, imperialistic, and colonialist policies. (Applause)

The American representative said that the People's Republic of China is trying to occupy the islands in the Pacific. But what kind of islands are these, I ask you, Mr. Representative of American imperialism? The People's Republic of China wants to liberate Taiwan Island and other islands. To whom do these islands belong?

Please take a look at the international agreements on this (the American representative also signed these agreements), and you will see that they say that Taiwan Island and other islands not far from the Chinese coast belong to the Chinese people. (Applause) Liberating these islands is the legitimate right of the People's Republic of China. We supported it in the past, we support it now, and we will support these legitimate rights of the Chinese people in the future. (Applause) Even, I must say, the government of the People's Republic of China has shown great restraint in liberating these islands. This is their internal affair, and no one has the right to interfere. If the Soviet Union encountered this situation, you can believe that we would not tolerate others occupying our territory, and we would have long thrown all the traitors into hell, not even allowing their souls to remain there, so that these islands could be returned to the people. (Applause)

The American representative here also talked endlessly about the system of People's China. He distorted and fabricated the situation there in every possible way, saying that various repressions were being carried out there. All of this is malicious slander against People's China. This kind of tactic is nothing new. How much slander has been directed against the Soviet Union, and how many ghost stories have been told about its demise! But the Soviet Union exists and is increasingly prosperous. There is no system more democratic than the system of socialist countries.

American gentlemen, are you qualified to talk about what this democracy is! Sooner or later, you will have to learn how to organize a system that truly respects the rights of everyone. True democracy is only possible under socialism and communism. Before talking about the system in socialist countries, I advise the American representative to look in the mirror to see clearly what kind of system exists in the United States.

The American representative here complained to African countries that the United States seems to like these countries and care about them. But, kind sir, if the representatives of these countries do not have United Nations documents, can they spend the night in a hotel in your democratic country, eat meals and desserts in restaurants where white people eat? No, they cannot. This is an insult and damage to the dignity of every person. There is a clear distinction between white and black people in the United States. Is this democracy, is this respect for people? No, this is an act of hatred for people, spreading hostility between white and black people.

Let black people, Asian, and other African representatives come to us, to the Soviet Union, to the People's Republic of China, to any socialist country. They will be treated like true human beings there, with love and friendship. They receive these treatments not because they are black, but because our people sympathize with those who are struggling for their freedom, who have been humiliated and oppressed by colonialists for many centuries, and have deep feelings for them.

In the United States, black people are often killed and hanged by the death penalty, simply because they are black. The whole world knows this. Books describe this, and newspapers report this. American representative, please look at your own history! We admire Lincoln, this great American, who raised the banner of struggle for the liberation of black people. He was an American who once opposed other Americans for equality and justice among people. But racial discrimination still exists in the United States today. Until now, black children in many parts of the United States still cannot go to school with white children. Isn't this a disgrace to civilized society? And the American representative dares to slander the true democratic system of the People's Republic of China, which is now building socialism. In this situation, our people often say: "Anyone's cow can moo, only your cow can't moo." (Laughter, applause)

The American representative brazenly slandered the system of the People's Republic of China. In response to this, I want to say: the American ruling circles maintain very good friendship with those far from democratic regimes.

You take Franco—this executioner of the Spanish people—as your good friend. This person suppresses all democratic freedoms in Spain, establishes a bloody dictatorship, and constantly chops off the heads of the best children of Spain. However, the Spanish people are rising up to fight and compete with the executioner, and truth will surely triumph on the land of Spain! (Applause)

(At this time, the chairman of the meeting interrupted Khrushchev's speech and said that he requested the speaker to cooperate with him and not to make personal attacks on the head of a country that has joined the United Nations. He announced that these words of the speaker would not be included in the official record of the meeting.)

Khrushchev: I think the chairman's opinion is inappropriate.

Why didn't you stop the American representative when he slandered great China? There should be equal conditions for all countries in the United Nations, but we cannot tolerate insults to socialist countries. I reject this opinion. We are not beggars here, but representatives of a great nation, a great socialist country. We are protecting our friend—the People's Republic of China, protecting its system and its laws! (Applause)

Now let's talk about the Franco regime again. The United States maintains friendly treaty relations with this regime and has its own military bases in Spanish territory in order to use these bases to implement its aggressive imperialist policies.

The American government has another good friend, whom they simply want to call "genius"—this is Syngman Rhee, the executioner of the Korean people. He has brought things to such an extent that he was thrown out of South Korea and secretly fled Korea on an American plane. Where is he hiding now? There is no need to doubt that the United States is nurturing him, of course.

In South Vietnam, heads are often falling to the ground, and the United States is actually ruling there.

Now I want to give one more point in response to the American representative's speech. He blamed Comrade Peng Zhen for calling the United States an imperialist country and calling Mr. Hammarskjöld (he is now the Secretary-General of the United Nations, but I think this injustice will be corrected) the executor of colonialist policies. If the American representative believes that this is a reason to demand that the People's Republic of China not be admitted to the United Nations, then how can the American representative tolerate the presence of the Soviet representative here? The Soviet representative has always opposed the imperialist policies of the United States and the shameful role played by Mr. Hammarskjöld in the Congo.

One more reason. Representatives, it is up to you how you decide on the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of People's China in the United Nations. Sometimes, some people think that this decision is the truth when they make an unjust decision. However, time and history will overturn this decision as it overturns false things. What do those who oppose China's rights in the United Nations hope for? Do they hope that only representatives of countries with the same social structure are in the United Nations? They do not like the People's Republic of China, and they do not like the socialist system. If socialist countries withdraw from the United Nations, establish their own international organizations, and call on other countries to support their efforts in the struggle for peace, then what will happen? You must know that this will be the tomb of the United Nations. This will not be the United Nations, but two group organizations that will always confront each other. This will not lead to the easing of international tensions, but to its exacerbation, leading to an arms race.

We do not want this. What we want is that the United Nations truly unite all countries, regardless of their socio-political system, and that it truly unite all nations. Our common duty is to ensure that there is no war and no military conflicts between countries on the earth, and this can only be achieved if all countries are united in the United Nations. That is why we support the United Nations.

Whoever wants world peace, whoever wants disarmament, should support the People's Republic of China in occupying its legitimate seat in the United Nations, so that it can participate in the activities of the United Nations aimed at strengthening peace.

What the U.S. government has presented here reflects the old policy of imperialism of provoking some countries to oppose others. That's why they don't want China to occupy its seat in the United Nations. They need this in order to implement the "Cold War" policy, the arms race policy, and to undermine the possibility of reaching a disarmament agreement. This is done to implement the Dulles policy and the "brink of war" policy. However, everyone knows that any edge is unstable, and even the best-trained and most flexible gymnasts often slip off the edge. It often happens that they fall and die. This is a person's misfortune. However, if the policy implemented on the brink of war "falls off" this edge, it will be a disaster for the countries of the world, because the war will be very fierce, it will be a rocket-nuclear war.

Those who have not thought about this should think deeply.

In order not to further exacerbate international tensions, the rights of People's China in the United Nations should be restored. The Chiang Kai-shek elements' corpse should be thrown into hell, and the seat of the United Nations should be given to the truly living—the People's Republic of China. (Applause)

    就中国在联合国的代表权问题
    赫鲁晓夫在联大全体会议上的讲话
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：赫鲁晓夫1960年10月1日在联合国大会全体会议上就中国在联合国的代表权问题发表讲话，全文如下：主席先生！代表先生们！
    苏联代表团认为有必要把恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利问题提交大会讨论。
    毫无疑问，人为地不让中华人民共和国参加联合国的活动，给我们的组织带来了重大的损失，大大地缩小了联合国的活动范围，阻碍着需要各国集体努力来解决的国际问题的讨论，实际上使得有成效地讨论极其重要的问题成为不可能。
    我想特别强调指出，这里谈到是恢复一个大国的权利，根据联合国宪章，这个大国是联合国的创始会员国、安全理事会的常任理事国，但是，至今它还未能占有理应属于它的席位，未能参加联合国各机构的工作和对联合国的活动作出自己的贡献。拥有世界人口四分之一的伟大中国人民在这个组织中（它的使命是成为最广泛的国际议事场所，它的基础是世界一切国家普遍派有代表的原则）没有自己的代表，这种情况是十分不正常的。
    在联合国中，不同社会制度和管理形式的国家都有代表，在这里，应当像镜子一样反映现代世界的真实面貌。但是，在当前的情况下，在这里，在联合国，没有中国的代表，于是现代世界的真正图景在联合国得不到反映，它被歪曲了。每一个思想健全的人都清楚，中华人民共和国是一个团结着全体中国人民的伟大国家，中华人民共和国政府在中国整个领土上行使着全部国家政权，仅仅一些岛屿除外，在这些岛屿上，被中国人民击溃的蒋介石集团的残余在美国军舰的掩护下暂时还盘踞在那里。
    中华人民共和国获得了广泛的国际承认，并同三十四个国家建立了正常的外交关系。中华人民共和国的国际联系正在迅速地扩大。人民中国的贸易联系和文化联系现在已经包括差不多整个世界。
    中国人民正在从事巨大的劳动，来把过去经济落后的国家变为先进的社会主义工业国。因此，它切身地关心和平，主张和平的国际经济和文化合作。
    中国是1954年和平共处五项原则的创始者之一，中华人民共和国政府不止一次地提出旨在缓和远东和全世界国际紧张局势的建议。中华人民共和国对和平解决印度支那、朝鲜以及亚洲大陆其他地区局势的事业作出了重大的贡献。中国政府积极主张建立亚洲和平区和太平洋地区的无原子武器区。它建议亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国，包括美国在内，缔结互不侵犯的和平公约。
    中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志今年8月1日在北京发表讲话时再次着重指出，中华人民共和国政府遵循着不同社会制度国家和平共处的政策。他说，“我们不仅愿意同亚洲国家、阿拉伯国家，实现和平共处，而且也愿意同欧洲国家以及世界其他地区的国家，实现和平共处。”他接着说，“我们主张亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内，签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约，把这整个地区建成为没有核武器的地区。”
    中国政府的政策令人信服地证实，它坚定地站在和平共处五项原则的基础上，并且用具体的行动支持联合国的基本宗旨和原则，对扩大国际合作和加强和平与各国人民友谊的事业作出重大的努力。
    关于人民中国在联合国的代表权这样一个重要而极其明确的问题，为什么联合国直到现在还没有加以解决呢？主要是因为，美国不愿意这样。它尽一切力量使中华人民共和国不能在联合国中占有自己的合法席位。
    在联合国大会本届会议上，许多国家和政府的首脑十分明确地说，由于在联合国中没有伟大人民中国的代表而形成的局面是十分不能令人容忍的。美国政府奉行敌视和侵略人民中国的政策。远在1950年美国就对中国进行了侵略，用武力强占了台湾岛，并且继续利用台湾岛作为对中华人民共和国进行军事挑衅的基地，继续增加远东的所谓“威慑力量”，把亿万美元用于援助蒋介石分子准备新的军事挑衅。
    美国沿着中国的边境建立了许多军事基地。最近一年半来，美国在远东地区进行了四十多次大规模的军事演习，其中几乎有一半是在台湾和台湾海峡进行的，而且美国将军们并不掩饰，这些演习的矛头是指向中华人民共和国的。
    同时，美国高级政治人物瞎说什么中华人民共和国有“侵略性”。他们经常提到美国过去强加于联合国大会的关于宣布中国为“侵略者”的非法决议。顺便提一提，对于上述的决议提出这样一个问题是适当的：现在谁的军队还驻扎在朝鲜呢？如果国务院健忘的话，那么可以提醒一下，那里早就没有中国志愿军了，而美国军队却继续占领着南朝鲜。
    美国政府企图使蒋介石和他的被中国人民推翻了的腐朽政权这样的政治僵尸复活，这种企图只是毒害着远东的国际局势。
    尊敬的代表们！联合国关于中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位问题，已经讨论了十年多了。各国代表每次登上这个讲坛，都谈出自己政府对这个重要问题的态度。各国在讨论这个问题时，每次基本上分成两派。一些国家遵循着实际事态的逻辑，保卫伟大中国人民的合法权利，直截了当地断然声明：已是时候了，应该消除历史上这一极不合理的现象，建议中华人民共和国政府派遣自己的代表团同我们一起在联合国，并参加联合国的全部活动。
    另外一些国家的代表通过种种借口，规避作出公正的决议，这样或那样地跟着美国政府走，阻挠联合国通过关于恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的决议。
    美国政府用以反对人民中国的论据，只有那些追随美国政客的人才会相信。早在十一年以前，由于卖国的国民党政权的崩溃和人民中国革命的胜利，美国政客在中国遭到了失败。
    大家都十分清楚，美国统治集团有十六年不承认苏联，仅仅是因为我国人民消灭了资产阶级—地主制度和实现了伟大的社会主义革命。对于这一点，苏联人民当然没有向美国的这些或者那些政客请求许可。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下也是这样做的。
    我们不怀疑，终有一天美国的政客对人民中国会表现出比较清醒的态度，而不是现在处处所表现出的仇视态度，那时他们会以应有的态度尊重这个伟大的国家。
    只要中华人民共和国在联合国中没有自己的合法席位，就不能为有效的谈判和解决裁军问题创造条件。因为即使达成裁军协议，这种协议没有中国参加，难道会有效吗？要知道，即使有了裁军协定，美国也会说，因为没有中国的参加，这个协定不能实行，但是，对于中华人民共和国参加联合国，他们却百般阻挠。
    尊敬的代表先生们，我们坚决要求你们打破这种恶性循环。因为没有中国，就谈不上裁军，没有中国，联合国就不能进行正常的工作。
    美国和其他某些西方国家由于感觉到在联合国中蒋介石分子“代表”了中国这种说法是荒谬的，并且担心国民党走狗的命运，于是企图拖出臭名远扬的“两个中国”的主张。但是，“两个中国”的主张实质上是伪装得不高明的颠覆行为，它的目的是要肢解伟大中国的领土，夺走它的一个部分——台湾省，这种企图对谁都不是秘密。
    早就很明显，制造“两个中国”的挑衅性的计划必然要遭到破产。美国的某些政治家愈早理解到这点，对世界和平事业就愈有利。
    如果有谁认为，首先是中华人民共和国需要恢复中国在联合国的权利，那是不正确的。这些先生们错了。如果正确理解我们这个组织作为一个联合所有国家的普遍性组织的使命的话，那末，就很难说，是谁更需要恢复中国在联合国的权利——是中国自己呢？还是应当成为最广泛的、具有代表性的国际组织的联合国呢？这个组织需要像中华人民共和国这样一个大国、这样一个强国在联合国中有其代表，并且积极参加联合国的活动。
    正因为如此，苏联代表团建议把恢复中国在联合国的合法权利的问题，作为一个重要和紧迫的问题，在大会会议一开始，就进行讨论和予以解决。
    代表先生们，现在请允许我来回答美国代表的发言。美国代表说必须继续奉行现在已经破产的对中华人民共和国的政策，他提议拒绝苏联关于恢复中国在联合国的合法权利的建议。
    美国代表在这里以北京市长彭真同志的演说为借口。我很熟悉彭真同志，如果你们见到了他，你们就会理解，他完全不像这里有人所说的那样。他是一个很好的在国内受到尊敬的人。美国代表的借口是，彭真同志把美国称作帝国主义国家。然而，先生们，这难道是一个发现吗？（掌声）全世界都知道，支持殖民主义制度的最富有帝国主义性质的大国，就是美国。屋顶上所有的麻雀却在唧唧喳喳地议论这点。（掌声）而美国代表竟对彭真同志的这句话表示愤慨，多么冤枉啊！这正像一个贵妇人冒充是处女，其实她至少生过十来个孩子了。（场内笑声，掌声）
    美国代表还说，彭真同志提到哈马舍尔德先生在刚果执行了有利于美帝国主义、有利于殖民主义者的政策。难道这也是新闻？哈马舍尔德先生自己比彭真更加清楚，他在刚果奉行谁的政策，他是垄断资本的忠实仆人，他在联合国中代表那些执行掠夺性的、帝国主义的、殖民主义的政策的国家的利益。（掌声）
    美国代表说，中华人民共和国竭力想要占领太平洋上的岛屿。但是这是些什么样的岛屿呢，我请问您，美帝国主义代表先生？中华人民共和国想解放台湾岛和其他岛屿。这些岛屿是属于谁的呢？
    请看一看关于这点的国际协定吧（在这些协定上也有美国代表的签字），你们将看到，那上面写着，台湾岛和其他离中国沿岸不远的岛屿是属于中国人民的。（掌声）解放这些岛屿，这是中华人民共和国的合法权利，我们过去支持，现在支持，将来还要支持中国人民的这些合法权利。（掌声）甚至，我还要说，中华人民共和国政府在解放这些岛屿这点上表现了很大的克制的态度。这是他们的内政，任何人都无权干涉。如果苏联也遇到这种情况，你们可以相信，我们不会容忍别人占领我们的领土，并且早就把所有的卖国贼扔到鬼门关去了，连他们的魂都不让留在那里，要使这些岛屿还给人民。（掌声）
    美国代表在这里还喋喋不休地谈到了人民中国的制度。他百般歪曲和臆造那里的情况，说什么在那里进行种种镇压。所有这一切都是对人民中国的恶毒的诽谤。这种手段不是什么新玩艺儿。对苏联进行过多少诽谤，说了多少关于它要灭亡的鬼话！但是苏联存在着，并且日益繁荣。没有比社会主义国家的制度更民主的制度了。
    美国先生们，难道你们有资格谈论什么是这个民主！你们迟早得要学习学习怎么组织使每个人的权利能得到真正尊重的制度。真正的民主只有在社会主义，共产主义的条件下才有可能。在谈论社会主义国家中的制度以前我劝美国代表照照镜子，以便看看清楚，美国存在着什么样的制度。
    美国代表在这里向非洲国家申诉说，美国似乎喜欢这些国家，关心它们。但是，好心的先生，如果这些国家的代表没有联合国的文件，他们是否能在你们这个民主国家的旅馆里过夜，在白人吃饭的饭店里吃饭吃点心呢？不，不能。这是对每个人的尊严的凌辱和损害。在美国白人和黑人之间有着鲜明的界限。难道这是民主，难道这是尊重人？不，这是仇视人的行为，是散布白人和黑人之间的敌视。
    让黑人，亚洲和非洲其他民族的代表到我们那里来，到苏联，到中华人民共和国，到任何一个社会主义国家，他们在那里将受到真正人的对待，热爱和友谊。他们受到这些待遇不是因为他们是黑人，而是因为我们的人民同情那些为争取自己的自由而斗争的、许多世纪都遭到并忍受殖民主义者的屈辱和压迫的人，对他们有深切的好感。
    在美国，经常用死刑杀害和绞死黑人，这仅仅因为他们是黑人。全世界都知道这点。书本也描写这点，报纸也报道这点。美国代表，请看看自己的历史吧！我们敬仰林肯这位伟大的美国人，他曾举起为解放黑人而斗争的旗帜。他是美国人，曾经为争取人民之间的平等和公正而反对过其他美国人。但是现在美国仍然存在着种族歧视。直到现在，美国许多地方的黑人儿童还不能同白人在一起上学。难道这不是文明社会的耻辱吗？而美国代表却胆敢诽谤现在正在建设社会主义的中华人民共和国的真正的民主制度。对这种情况，我们那里的人们常说：“不管谁的牛都能叫，只有你的牛不能叫。”（场内笑声，掌声）
    美国代表放肆地诽谤中华人民共和国的制度。针对这一点我要说：美国统治集团同那些远不民主的制度保存着非常好的友谊。
    你们拿佛朗哥——这个西班牙人民的刽子手作你们的好朋友，这个人压制西班牙的一切民主自由，建立了血腥的独裁制度，不断砍掉西班牙最优秀儿女的头颅。不过，西班牙人民正在起来斗争，同刽子手较量，真理一定会在西班牙的土地上获得胜利！（掌声）
      （这时会议主席打断了赫鲁晓夫的发言，并且说，他请求发言人同他合作，不要对一个加入联合国的国家的首脑进行个人攻击。他宣布，发言人的这些话将不载入会议的正式记录。）
    赫鲁晓夫：我认为主席的意见是不适当的。
    为什么当美国代表诽谤伟大的中国时，您不制止他呢？在联合国中应当对所有国家都有平等的条件，然而你允许对社会主义国家进行侮辱，我们就不能忍受。我拒绝这种意见。我们在这里并不是乞求者，而是伟大民族、伟大社会主义国家的代表，我们在保护我们的朋友——中华人民共和国，保护它的制度、它的法律！（掌声）
    现在再来谈佛朗哥政权。美国同这个政权保持着友好的条约关系，在西班牙领土上有自己的军事基地，以便利用这些基地来执行自己的侵略性的帝国主义政策。
    美国政府另外有一个好朋友，他们简直想把他叫作“天才”——这就是李承晚，朝鲜人民的刽子手。他已经把事情搞到这样的程度：他被人从南朝鲜扔了出来，偷偷地坐着美国飞机从朝鲜跑掉了。他现在躲在什么地方？大家不必怀疑，当然美国在豢养着他。
    在越南南方人头也经常落地，而在那里实行统治的实际也是美国。
    现在我想再举一点来回答美国代表的发言，他责备彭真同志把美国叫作帝国主义国家，把哈马舍尔德先生（他现在是联合国秘书长，但是我想这种不公正的情况将会得到纠正）叫作殖民主义者的政策的执行者。如果美国代表认为根据这点就可以要求不接纳中华人民共和国加入联合国，那么试问美国代表怎么能容忍苏联代表在这里出席呢？苏联代表过去和现在一直反对美国的帝国主义的政策，反对哈马舍尔德先生在刚果扮演的可耻的角色。
    还有一个理由。代表先生们，你们如何决定关于恢复人民中国在联合国的合法权利的问题，这是你们的事情。有时，一些人在作出不公正的决定时，认为这种决定是真理。但是，时间、历史将像推翻虚伪的东西一样，推翻这种决定。反对中国在联合国的权利的人们希望的是什么呢？难道他们希望，在联合国里只有同样的社会结构的国家的代表吗？他们不喜欢中华人民共和国，他们不喜欢社会主义制度。如果社会主义国家退出联合国，建立自己的国际组织，并呼吁其他国家支持它们在争取和平的斗争中的努力的话，那末，将会怎样呢？要知道，这将是联合国的坟墓。这将不是联合国了，而是两个集团组织，它们将一直地彼此对峙。这不会导致国际紧张局势的缓和，而是导致它的加剧，导致军备竞赛。
    我们不希望这样，我们希望的是，联合国真正把一切国家联合起来，而不管其社会政治制度如何，希望它真正把所有的民族联合起来。我们共同的职责是，保证地球上能过各国之间没有战争、没有军事冲突的生活，而这只有一切国家都团结在联合国这一个组织里，才能够实现。正因为如此，我们才支持联合国。
    谁希望世界和平，谁希望裁军，谁就应该赞成中华人民共和国在联合国中占有合法席位，使它能够参与联合国旨在加强和平的活动。
    美国政府在这里所提出的东西反映了帝国主义挑拨一些国家来反对另一些国家的老政策。所以他们不希望中国在联合国中占有自己的席位。他们所以需要这样，是为了执行“冷战”政策，军备竞赛政策和破坏达成裁军协定的可能性。这样做是为了执行杜勒斯政策，执行“战争边缘”政策。但是，大家都知道，任何边缘都是不稳固的，就连经过专门训练的最好的柔软体操家都时常会从边缘上滑下来。常有这样的事发生：他们一跌下来就摔死了。这是一个人的不幸。但是，如果在战争边缘上执行的政策从这个边缘上“跌下来”，这将是对世界各国的灾难，因为战争将是很厉害的，战争将是火箭—核战争。
    那些没有想到这点的人，应当深思。
    为了不让国际紧张局势进一步尖锐化，应当恢复人民中国在联合国的权利。应当把蒋介石分子僵尸打入鬼门关，把联合国的席位给予真正活着的——中华人民共和国。（掌声）
