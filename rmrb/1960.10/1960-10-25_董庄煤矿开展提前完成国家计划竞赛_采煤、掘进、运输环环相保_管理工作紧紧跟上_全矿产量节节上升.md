Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 24th. Under the slogan of "Everything Ahead of Schedule, All Work Moving Forward," the workers of the Xuzhou Dongzhuang Coal Mine are enthusiastically carrying out a competition to complete the national plan ahead of schedule, ensuring that coal mining is ahead of schedule and tunneling is ahead of extraction, thereby promoting the continuous rise of coal production levels. The entire mine completed its coal mining plan five days ahead of schedule in September, and in the first half of October, it completed its bi-monthly coal mining task two days ahead of schedule.

When discussing the production increase and economy plan, the mine's workers proposed to complete each shift's task two hours ahead of schedule, each day's task three hours ahead of schedule, each ten-day period's task one day ahead of schedule, and each month's task three days ahead of schedule, striving for the lead at all times to ensure the early completion of the annual task. All units, departments, work areas, teams, and individuals above and below ground in the entire mine formulated "ahead of schedule" guarantee conditions, linked with each other, and launched a competition.

In the competition, coal mining workers took the lead, striving to be ahead of the plan. In order to ensure the early completion of the plan, the workers of Liu Deyi's team in Coal Mining Area One adopted the method of moving the scraper conveyor while extracting coal, seizing every minute and second to extract more coal, completing the plan ahead of schedule every day, and completing fifteen days of coal mining tasks in ten days. All shifts and teams in the mine competed to be ahead of schedule and to be advanced, which promoted the rapid rise of coal mining levels.

According to the constantly improving requirements of coal mining levels, the tunneling work area workers boosted their energy and accelerated the footage, so that tunneling kept ahead of coal mining. Wang Qingfang's team in Tunneling Area One and another team engaged in a competition, learning from each other's strengths to compensate for weaknesses. Since the beginning of October, the average shift footage has exceeded the plan by more than half. Two new working faces were prepared fifteen and twenty days ahead of schedule respectively, creating good conditions for the sustained high growth of coal production.

With the increase of mining and tunneling production, logistics and management work also kept up quickly. Personnel from various departments went deep into the front line underground and actively served production. The transportation and hanging work area organized forces to repair rails and mine cars, and rushed to manufacture spare parts for consumables; transportation personnel carried out a "four fast" competition of fast loading, fast pushing, fast hoisting, and fast unloading, which greatly shortened the turnover time of mine cars and improved the hoisting capacity, adapting to the needs of the rising mining production. The material section actively moved materials and tools to the underground, setting up on-site supply groups. Supply personnel constantly patrolled the working faces, promptly understood the needs, and handled the material issuance procedures on the spot. The electromechanical section personnel formed a shock team and sent chisels and other tools to each working face; as soon as mechanical equipment and tools malfunctioned, they were repaired or replaced on the spot to ensure normal production. All management staff in the mine worked hard to support the competition on the production front line.

    董庄煤矿开展提前完成国家计划竞赛
    采煤、掘进、运输环环相保　管理工作紧紧跟上　全矿产量节节上升
    新华社南京24日电　徐州董庄煤矿职工在“事事都提前，一切工作向前赶”的口号下，热烈开展提前完成国家计划的竞赛，做到采煤走在计划前，掘进走在回采前，促使煤炭生产水平不断上升。全矿9月份提前五天完成了采煤计划，10月上半月又提前两天完成了半月采煤任务。
    这个矿的职工在讨论增产节约计划时，提出要一班任务提前两小时完成，一天任务提前三小时完成，一旬任务提前一天完成，一月任务提前三天完成，时时争先，确保全年任务的提前完成。全矿井上井下各个单位、部门、工区、班组和个人，纷纷制订“提前”的保证条件，相互挂钩，开展竞赛。
    竞赛中，采煤职工一马当先，力争走在计划前面。采煤一区刘德一小组的工人为了保证提前完成计划，采取了边移溜子、边出煤的办法，争分夺秒多采煤炭，天天提前完成计划，在十天里就完成了十五天的采煤任务。全矿各班各组都这样争提前，争先进，促使采煤水平迅速上升。
    掘进工区职工根据采煤水平不断提高的要求，大鼓干劲，加快进尺，使掘进赶在采煤前面。掘进一区王庆芳小组和另一个小组挂钩比武，取长补短，10月上旬以来平均班进尺赶过计划一半以上，两个新的工作面分别提前十五天、二十天就准备好，为煤炭生产的持续高涨创造了良好的条件。
    采掘生产提高，后勤和管理工作也迅速跟上。各科室人员纷纷深入井下第一线，积极为生产服务。运挂工区组织力量，整修铁轨、矿车，赶制易耗部件的备品；运输人员开展了快装、快推、快提升、快卸的“四快”竞赛，大大缩短了矿车周转时间，提高了提升能力，适应了采掘生产上升的需要。器材科把器材、工具主动搬到井下，设立现场供应组。供应人员不断地在工作面上巡回，及时了解需要，就地办理器材领发手续。机电科人员组成突击小组，把钎子等都送到各工作面；机械设备、工具一出毛病，就当场检修或换用，保证生产正常进行。全矿管理工作人员都努力支持生产第一线的竞赛。
