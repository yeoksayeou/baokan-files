Indian Communist Party Secretary Joshi Exposes World Bank's "Aid" as a Trap

Indian Communist Party Secretariat Secretary Joshi published an article in the "New Age" weekly on September 11, exposing that what the World Bank gives to India is not aid, but a trap.

Joshi's article was written in response to the recent survey report on the Indian economy by the World Bank's "Hoffman Mission," which is controlled by the United States. He pointed out that this report, on the one hand, also deliberately advocated "increasing the importance of agricultural production," and at the same time, it particularly criticized India's steel, coal, and oil plans. "They are again playing the trick of exerting pressure, requiring India's plan to actually be mainly an agricultural plan. And if any industrialization is to be carried out, it must be under the control of foreign capital and must be in the private sector."

    印共书记乔希揭露世界银行的“援助”是陷阱
    印度共产党书记处书记乔希九月十一日在“新世纪”周报上发表文章揭露，世界银行给印度的并不是援助，而是陷阱。
    乔希的这篇文章是针对由美国控制的世界银行的“霍夫曼代表团”最近发表的关于印度经济的调查报告而写的。他指出，这份报告一方面别有用心地也鼓吹“增加农业生产的重要性”，同时又特别批评印度的钢、煤和石油计划。“他们又在搞那种施加压力的把戏，要印度的计划实际上主要只是农业性质的计划。而且如果要实行什么工业化的话，那必须是在外国资本的控制下实行的，而且必须是在私营部分。”
