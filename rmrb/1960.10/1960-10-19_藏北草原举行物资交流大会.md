Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa. A grand material exchange conference was recently held in Damxung County on the Northern Tibetan Grasslands.

More than 3,000 herdsmen, driving over 10,000 yaks loaded with local animal products, came to participate in this conference. They brought tents, pots, and tsampa, and settled here with their families, creating temporary homes. Young and strong herdsmen, dressed in new clothes and riding fast horses, participated in the horse racing event held at the same time. Because the lives of herdsmen in some pastoral areas of Northern Tibet have improved after the "Three Antis and Two Benefits" movement (Three Antis: anti-rebellion, anti-corvée labor, and anti-feudal servitude; Two Benefits: benefiting both herdsmen and herd-owners) was launched, this material exchange conference was particularly lively.

State-owned trading organizations set up four trading groups here. In addition to selling various general merchandise, these trading groups also purchased large quantities of wool, medicinal materials, hides, and other local animal products.

The once desolate and deserted grassland was now filled with tents, and people bustled about, singing from morning till night. During the day, herdsmen selected what they needed from various trading groups and sold their local animal products at fair prices. At night, they watched movies screened by the mobile projection team or went to see performances specially put on for them by the Lhasa Youth and Women's Federation amateur song and dance troupe.

During the conference, a horse racing event with rich ethnic characteristics was held, with over 1,000 horses participating in the competition. At the same time, some herdsmen also held track and field sports meets, including high jump and long jump.

During this material exchange conference, according to statistics, the four trading groups received a total of more than 16,000 people in seven days, with a total transaction value of 100,000 yuan. Herdsmen not only exchanged their local animal products for daily necessities such as highland barley, tea, and salt, but also purchased large quantities of cloth, woolen clothes and trousers, shoes and socks, red dates, and white sugar.

    藏北草原举行物资交流大会
    新华社拉萨电　一个盛大的物资交流大会最近在藏北草原上的当雄县举行。
    三千多牧民?喝着一万多头满载土畜产品的牦牛前来参加了这个大会，他们带着帐篷和锅壶、糌粑，扶老携幼在这里安上了临时的家，青壮年牧民们穿上新装，骑上快马，参加了同时举行的赛马会。由于藏北部分牧区在展开“三反两利”（三反即反叛乱、反乌拉差役、反人身依附制度；两利即牧工、牧主两利）运动后，牧民生活有了改善，这次物资交流大会特别热闹。
    国营贸易机构在这里设立了四个贸易组，这些贸易组除了销售各色百货外，还大量收购羊毛、药材、皮张等土畜产品。
    昔日冷落荒凉的草原上，遍地搭起了帐篷，人们熙来攘往，从早到晚歌声不断。白天牧民们在各个贸易组选购自己所需要的东西，和用公平的价格出售自己的土畜产品；入夜，他们观看巡回放映队为他们放映的电影，或是去看拉萨市青、妇联业余歌舞队专门为他们的演出。
    大会期间，举行了富有民族色彩的赛马会，一千多匹马参加了比赛；同时部分牧民还举行了跳高、跳远的田径赛运动会。
    在这次物资交流大会上，据统计，四个贸易组七天共接待了一万六千多人次，成交总额达十万元。牧民们不但将自己的土畜产品换到了青稞、茶叶、盐巴等生活必需品，而且还大量购买了布匹、绒衣裤、鞋袜、红枣、白糖等。
