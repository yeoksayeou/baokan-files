    Old Hero of the Yan'an Era Returns to the Agricultural Front
    ——An Account of Tian Huapei, Deputy Director of the Qinghai Province Transportation Department Highway Bureau
    Ou Huaguo, Zhao Huaiqing

    Tian Huapei, Deputy Director of the Qinghai Province Transportation Department Highway Engineering Bureau, actively responded to the Party's call and resolutely rushed to the agricultural front, leading employees to overcome numerous difficulties and establish an administrative farm on barren land. His exemplary deeds have had a great impact on the cadres and workers in Qinghai Province. Currently, a province-wide movement for workers in the industrial and transportation systems to learn from and surpass Tian Huapei is widely underway.

    Thirty years ago, Tian Huapei joined the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in his hometown of Hubei and experienced the 25,000-li Long March. In 1942, the Japanese invading army implemented the "Three Alls" policy in the revolutionary base areas, and the Kuomintang bandit army of Hu Zongnan heavily blockaded northern Shaanxi. At that time, he responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and participated in the Great Production Movement amidst frequent battles and intense training. In those difficult years, his company did not take a single grain of food from the local people, but instead supported the people with a large amount of vegetables and grain. For this, he represented the entire company at the model worker conference held by the Party Central Committee in Yan'an in 1943. After the national liberation, he transitioned from a commander of the People's Liberation Army to a socialist construction post.

    This spring, after the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee issued a call to vigorously establish administrative farms, the Highway Engineering Bureau Party Committee decided to build an administrative farm on the Gangcha Grassland by Qinghai Lake. Tian Huapei requested the organization to send him to work at the farm. After the organization approved his request, he rushed to the Gangcha Grassland overnight and led the employees sent by the bureau to participate in agricultural production, throwing themselves into the battle of reclamation. The grassland was an endless expanse of millennia-old dormant land, and after years of wind and sun, the ground was as hard as a stone slab. The tools they brought were only picks and shovels used for road construction. Faced with this difficulty, some people suggested sending a telegram to have tools sent from home. Tian Huapei said, "Our homes aren't farm equipment factories, if we don't have tools, we'll make them ourselves!" "Make them ourselves? No iron, no furnace, no coal, what do we use to make them?" Tian Huapei then told everyone about their past land reclamation and production in Yan'an. At that time, they didn't have tools either, and they relied on their own ingenuity to cast them. He said to everyone, "Conditions are much better now, we have so many people, so many picks, we can certainly build a farm." After he said this, everyone's enthusiasm was boosted, and they all made guarantees to him, saying, "Director, don't worry, no matter what we lack, we must build the farm." So, he organized everyone to build a furnace, collect cow and sheep manure to burn as coal, and personally wielded the hammer and pulled the bellows. In just a few days, they converted hundreds of picks into board hoes suitable for grassland reclamation and also made many iron rakes.

    With the tool problem solved, he led people over mountains and ridges to find water sources dozens of miles away and built a more than ten-mile-long canal to bring water from the mountains to the farm. They learned that Tibetan people used to live here, leaving behind a lot of cattle and sheep manure, so they organized manpower to transport these fertilizers back to the farm and also processed and composted them, and the quality was quite good. Coupled with the fertilizer they smoked themselves, they immediately solved the fertilizer needed for more than 1,800 mu of land.

    Tian Huapei worked day and night with everyone. The grassland was so hard that he always dug with the board hoe until he was covered in sweat. The grassland in May was still bitterly cold, but he always took off his clothes to work. In the beginning, his fingers were so tired that he couldn't close them. The wounds left on his body from the revolutionary war often throbbed, and his stomach ailment also flared up, but he still persisted in working. While working, he chatted with everyone, understanding their thoughts and demands. Under his leadership, the canteen management level improved. He also mobilized everyone to fish in the river to improve their meals. When some workers fell ill, he personally brought meals to the patients' beds. At night, he always disregarded the fatigue of the day and quietly went to the workers' tents to check on them and cover them with quilts. Many people were therefore moved and said, "Old Director, you are really like our own family." He humbly said, "The Party sent me here, this is my duty."

    Tian Huapei promoted the work of the entire farm by "living, eating, working and consulting" with everyone and going to the teams to stay and work. As soon as he arrived at the farm, he discovered that the reason for the slow land reclamation and sowing efficiency and the low sowing quality was a problem with the organization of labor. After discussing with everyone, he changed the situation of "too many odd jobs, too many novice sowers, too many round trips, and too few people leveling the land." Another reason for the slow sowing progress was the backwardness of the tools. After repeated research with everyone, he came up with the method of using a car to tow a plow, which greatly improved efficiency. After ten days of hard work, they completed the task of reclaiming 3,000 mu of land as planned.

    Tian Huapei always adhered to the principle of running the farm diligently and thriftily. When the farm was first established, the general affairs personnel sent Tian Huapei a batch of purchase plans for him to approve, listing: writing desk, glass top, bicycle... He wrote a few words on it: "Poor family background, rich style. With such a non-thrifty style, it will be difficult to run the farm well." In his farm office, there wasn't even a desk. A wooden box nailed together from scrap wood was used for both office work and storing documents. He also had a "scrap collection box," which he filled with broken iron pieces that he picked up by hand every day in the fields. When making farm tools, these small things were very useful. A comrade jokingly said to him, "You have really become a scrap collector!" Tian Huapei smiled and said, "Don't look at these broken things, they were all bought with money. We must run the farm diligently and thriftily, and not show off and be extravagant."

    延安时代老英雄重返农业战线
    ——记青海省交通厅公路局副局长田华培
    欧华国　赵淮青
    青海省交通厅公路工程局副局长田华培，积极响应党的号召，毅然奔赴农业战线，领导职工排除重重困难，在荒滩上办起了一个机关农场。他的模范事迹在青海省职工干部中产生了很大的影响，目前全省工业交通系统的职工广泛展开了学赶超田华培的运动。
    田华培三十年前在家乡湖北参加工农红军，曾经历二万五千里长征。1942年，日本侵略军对革命根据地实行“三光”政策，国民党胡宗南匪军又重重封锁了陕北。当时他响应党中央和毛主席的号召，在频繁的战斗和紧张的练兵当中，参加了大生产运动。在那些艰苦的岁月里，他的连队没有向当地人民要一粒粮食，反而用大批蔬菜、粮食支援了人民。为此，他曾代表全连出席了1943年党中央在延安召开的劳模大会。全国解放后，他从一个人民解放军的指挥员转到了社会主义建设岗位。
    今年春天，中共青海省委发出大办机关农场的号召以后，公路工程局党委决定在青海湖畔的刚察草原上筹建机关农场。田华培要求组织上派他到农场去工作。组织上批准了他的要求后，他连夜赶到刚察草原，率领全局派去参加农业生产的职工，投入了垦荒战斗。草原上是一眼望不到边的千年沉睡的土地，经过积年累月风吹日晒，地面硬得像石板一样。而他们带的工具，却只是修公路用的十字镐、铁锹等。面对着这个困难，有人向田华培提出发电报叫家里运工具来。田华培说：“家里又不是农具厂，没有工具咱们自己造嘛！”“自己造？没铁、没炉子、没煤，用啥造呀？”田华培便给大家讲他们过去在延安开荒生产的情况，当时也没有工具，他们便是靠自己想办法铸造出来的。他向大家说：“现在条件好多了，咱们这么多人，这么多十字镐，还办不起个农场。”经他这样一说，大家的劲头鼓足了，纷纷向他提出保证说：“局长，你放心，管他少这缺那，反正农场一定要办起来。”于是，他组织大家盘炉子，拣来牛羊粪当煤烧，自己动手掌铁锤，拉风箱，不几天功夫把几百把十字镐改成了适于草原开荒的板镢，还造了许多铁耙子。
    工具问题解决了，他又领人翻山越岭到几十里地以外地方找到水源，修了一条十几里长的水渠，把水从山上引到农场。他们打听到过去这里曾住过藏民，遗留下很多牛、羊粪，便组织人力把这些肥料运回农场，又加工沤制了一下，质量挺不错。再加上他们自己熏制的肥料，一下解决了一千八百多亩地所需要的肥料。
    田华培日日夜夜和大家一起劳动。草滩那么硬，他拿起板镢总要挖得满头大汗。草原的5月仍是寒风刺骨，他却总是脱了衣服干。开头那些天，他的手指头都累得并不拢了，革命战争留在他身上的创伤还常常隐隐作痛，他的胃病也犯了，但他仍然坚持着劳动。他还一边干活，一边和大家谈家常，了解他们的想法和要求。在他主持下，食堂管理水平提高了。他又发动大家到河里捕鱼，改善伙食。有几个工人生病了，他亲自打饭送到病人床前。夜晚，他总是不顾一天的疲劳，悄悄地到工人帐房中去看看，给大家盖好被子。许多人因此感动地说：“老局长，你真像我们的亲人一样。”他却谦逊地说：“党把我派来了，这是我应尽的责任。”
    田华培通过和大家“四同”以及到队里蹲点，及时发现和解决问题，推动了全场的工作。刚到农场，他就发现垦荒播种工效慢、播种质量不高的原因，是劳力组织有问题。经过和大家一起研究商量后，改变了“打杂的多、撒种新手多、回空跑的多、平整土地的人少”等情况。播种进度慢还有个原因是工具落后，他和大家经过多次研究后，想出用汽车拖挂铧犁的办法，工效大大提高，奋战十天，完成了预定垦荒三千亩的任务。
    田华培始终坚持勤俭办农场的方针。刚建农场时，总务人员送给田华培一批购置计划请他批，上边列着：写字台、玻璃板、自行车……，他就批了几个字：“穷家当，富派头，有了这样不俭朴的作风，就很难办好农场”。在他的农场办公室里，连张桌子也没有，一个用废木料钉起来的木箱子，又办公，又存放文件。他还有个“废品收购箱”，里边装满了他每天下地随手拣回的碎铁件，要造农具，这些小东西可顶了大用。有位同志开玩笑地对他说：“你可真成了废品收购员啦！”田华培却笑笑说：“不要看这些东西破碎，可都是花钱买来的。我们要勤俭办场，不能摆富排场。”
