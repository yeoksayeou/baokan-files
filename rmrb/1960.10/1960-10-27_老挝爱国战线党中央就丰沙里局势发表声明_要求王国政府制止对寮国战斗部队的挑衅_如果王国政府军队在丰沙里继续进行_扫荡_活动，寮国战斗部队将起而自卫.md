Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 25th -- The Lao Fighting Units Radio today broadcast a statement issued on October 24th by a spokesman for the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front regarding the situation in Phongsaly.

The statement said that after an exchange of letters between Prince Souvanna Phouma and Prince Souphanouvong, the Lao Patriotic Front had, on September 18th, instructed its armed forces to cease military operations in Luang Prabang, Phongsaly, Vientiane, and other locations under the jurisdiction of the Phouma government.

The statement said that the initial cooperation between the Lao Patriotic Front and the Phouma government in the aforementioned locations, as well as the current negotiations between the two sides, dealt a serious blow to the interventionist conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary policy of the Phoumi Nosavan clique to divide the country. Therefore, they are using all kinds of means to provoke, sow discord, and carry out sabotage.

The statement pointed out that in Phongsaly, some reactionary military officers, acting as pawns of Phoumi Nosavan, are constantly "sweeping," persecuting the people, and attacking the armed forces of the Lao Fighting Units.

The statement revealed that on September 13th, the Lao Fighting Units in Hui Kong were ambushed by them, resulting in three injuries. On September 26th, 27th, 28th, and October 7th, 8th, and 9th, Captain Khouane ordered his troops to fire mortar shells at villagers and the armed forces of the Lao Fighting Units in Nam Nha district. On October 14th, Phongsaly Provincial Governor Khamvan Boupha forced the commando units and militia in Muang Ou and Muang Bun to conduct "sweeping" operations in the Phou Kha and Ban Phon areas, while military units stationed in Yang Dai and Bung Yang conducted "sweeping" operations in the Nam Nha and Na Sang areas.

The statement said that the people in the above-mentioned areas are extremely indignant at the brutal actions of the pawns of the Phoumi Nosavan clique.

The statement said that in the face of the above-mentioned actions by the lackeys of U.S. imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, the Lao Patriotic Front is denouncing their crimes to the people of the whole country and hopes that the Phouma government will recognize the above situation and take a firm attitude towards the reactionaries who, under the guise of loyalty to the government, are carrying out provocations, creating conflicts, and causing tension in the national situation.

The statement said that in order to stop the above events from happening, on October 13th, at the negotiation meeting between the two sides: the Lao Patriotic Front and the Royal Government delegation unanimously decided that both sides should order their armed forces to immediately cease conflicts between the two sides in order to create conditions for negotiations and cooperation between the two sides. However, the pawns of the Phoumi Nosavan clique in the Royal Army not only did not stop the provocations against the Lao Fighting Units and the suppression of the people, but even, with the help of U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries, concentrated the main forces, local forces, and commando units in Phongsaly since October 20th to carry out large-scale "sweeping" operations in the base areas of the Lao Fighting Units in order to implement the instructions of Major General Van Rattikone.

The statement said that faced with the above situation, the spokesman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front is authorized to issue the following statement:

1. The internal affairs of Laos must be decided by the Lao people themselves. U.S. imperialism and its traitorous lackeys must stop all actions interfering in Laos.

2. The Royal Government must take responsibility for the actions of the Royal Army in Phongsaly that violate the agreement reached between the Lao Patriotic Front and the Royal Government on the cessation of military operations, and must resolutely punish the reactionary groups that have been and are carrying out provocative and divisive activities.

3. The Royal Government must issue instructions to the units of the Royal Army in Phongsaly to immediately cease military operations and stop attacking the Lao Fighting Units, and immediately stop "sweeping," terror, and other destructive activities. If the above-mentioned attacks and "sweeping" activities continue to occur, then the people and the Lao Fighting Units will fight in self-defense, and the Royal Government will bear full responsibility for the serious consequences caused by the Royal Army.

The statement said that the Lao Patriotic Front calls on the cadres and soldiers of the main forces and local forces, and the guerrillas, to strictly fulfill the instructions of September 18th on the cessation of military operations. However, at the same time, they must always be vigilant to prevent the provocative conspiracies of the lackeys of U.S. imperialism—the reactionary groups. Be prepared in time to defeat their attacks and "sweeping" operations and protect the people's property.

The statement said that the Lao Patriotic Front hopes that the Royal Government will take resolute measures to oppose the provocations and divisive activities of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, to achieve good results in this negotiation, to create conditions for the realization of national harmony and unity, and for the peaceful neutrality, independence, democracy, unity, and prosperity of Laos.

    老挝爱国战线党中央就丰沙里局势发表声明
    要求王国政府制止对寮国战斗部队的挑衅
    如果王国政府军队在丰沙里继续进行“扫荡”活动，寮国战斗部队将起而自卫
    新华社河内25日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人10月24日就丰沙里局势发表的一项声明。
    声明说，在梭发那·富马亲王同苏发努冯亲王通过信件交换意见后，老挝爱国战线党已在9月18日指示自己的武装力量停止了在富马政府管辖下的琅勃拉邦、丰沙里、万象和其他各地的军事行动。
    声明说，老挝爱国战线党同富马政府之间在上述各地的初步的合作以及目前双方所进行的谈判，给予了美帝国主义的干涉阴谋和富米·诺萨万集团分割祖国的反动政策以严重的打击。因此，他们正在使用种种手段进行挑拨、离间和破坏活动。
    声明指出，在丰沙里，充当富米·诺萨万的爪牙的一些反动军官，不断地“扫荡”、迫害人民，进攻寮国战斗部队武装力量。
    声明揭露说，9月13日在会王的寮国战斗部队受到他们的狙击，有三名受伤。9月26、27、28日和10月7、8、9日，昏上尉命令他的军队用迫击炮射击南牙县的村民和寮国战斗部队武装力量。10月14日，丰沙里省长坎万·布发强迫芒乌、芒奔的别动队和民卫队在富卡和班丰地区进行“扫荡”，驻扎在阳代、崩阳的军事单位在南牙、纳桑地区进行“扫荡”。
    声明说，上述各地人民对富米·诺萨万集团的爪牙的残暴行动非常愤慨。
    声明说，面对着美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万叛国集团的走狗的上述行动，老挝爱国战线党向全国人民控诉他们的罪行，并希望富马政府认清上述情势，对打着忠于政府的幌子而进行挑衅、制造冲突，造成国家局势紧张的反动派采取坚决的态度。
    声明说，为了制止上述事件的发生，10月13日，在双方谈判的会议上：老挝爱国战线党和王国政府代表团一致决定：双方命令自己的武装力量立即停止双方之间的冲突，以便为双方之间的谈判和合作创造条件。但是，富米·诺萨万集团在王国军队中的爪牙，不仅没有停止对寮国战斗部队的挑衅和镇压人民的行动，甚至在美帝国主义和泰国反动派的帮助下，为了执行万·拉迪功少将的指示，10月20日以来竟把丰沙里的主力军、地方军和别动队集中起来在寮国战斗部队的根据地进行大规模“扫荡。”
    声明说，面临上述情况，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人受权发表声明如下：
    一、老挝的内政必须由老挝人民自己来决定。美帝国主义及其卖国走狗必须停止干涉老挝的一切行动。
    二、王国政府对在丰沙里王国军队违反老挝爱国战线党同王国政府所达成的关于停止军事行动的协议的行动，必须担负责任，并且要坚决惩办已经和正在进行挑衅和分裂活动的反动集团。
    三、王国政府必须向丰沙里各部队单位下达指示，立即停止军事行动和停止进攻寮国战斗部队，立即停止“扫荡”、恐怖和其他破坏活动。如果上述进攻和“扫荡”活动仍然继续发生，那末，人民和寮国战斗部队将战斗自卫，而王国政府对王国军队造成的严重后果要负完全责任。
    声明说，老挝爱国战线党呼吁主力部队和地方部队的干部和战士们、游击队员们要严正履行9月18日的关于停止军事行动的指示。但是，同时要时刻提高警惕，防止美帝国主义走狗——反动集团的挑衅阴谋。及时准备击败他们的进攻和“扫荡”，保卫人民财产。
    声明说，老挝爱国战线党希望王国政府采取坚决措施来反对美帝国主义及其走狗的挑衅、分裂活动，为这次的谈判取得良好结果、为实现民族和睦和统一、为老挝的和平中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣强盛创造条件。
