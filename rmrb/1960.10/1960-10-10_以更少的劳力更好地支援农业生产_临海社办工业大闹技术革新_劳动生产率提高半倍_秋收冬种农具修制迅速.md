According to Zhejiang Daily news: Linhai County's commune-run factories, while transferring labor to enrich the agricultural production front lines, are vigorously carrying out technical innovations, with everyone striving to "do the work of several people," to ensure the timely, high-quality, and high-quantity completion of the autumn harvest and winter planting agricultural implement repair and manufacturing tasks.

The Linhai County Party Committee resolutely implemented the Party's directives to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. After making overall arrangements, it transferred a large number of laborers from commune-run industries to strengthen the agricultural production front lines. To enable commune-run industries to support agricultural production better with less labor, the Party committees of many communes in the county earnestly strengthened the political and ideological work and production organization work of commune-run industries. They started by summarizing the previous stage of commune-run industries' work in supporting agricultural production, selected advanced producers, established pacesetters, and mobilized workers to launch a "one person doing the work of several" competition.

In order to support agricultural production better with less labor, all commune-run factories are vigorously carrying out technical innovations and tapping the potential for increasing production and practicing economy. For example, the Huayuan Bamboo Products Factory first innovated techniques in sawing bamboo, splitting bamboo, and splitting bamboo strips. Then, it seized on the weak link of weaving and carried out major innovations, manufacturing tools such as wooden basket-weaving machines. The quality of the agricultural implements woven was very good, and the labor force was reduced by twenty people, realizing "one weaver doing the work of three." After promoting the advanced experience of using one power machine for multiple purposes, the Tingpang Commune Machinery Factory achieved one power machine driving twenty-four machines, with seventy-eight people completing the workload that originally required two hundred and thirty-four people. In the past month, commune-run industries across the county have implemented 448 innovation projects, with an average increase in work efficiency of one to five times.

Through vigorously carrying out technical innovations and launching a "one person doing the work of several" labor competition, the production technology level of the county's commune-run industries has rapidly improved. Currently, 60% of iron, wood, and bamboo factories have achieved "one person doing the work of several." The labor productivity of commune-run industries across the county has increased by more than 50%, greatly accelerating the progress of autumn harvest and winter planting agricultural implement repair and manufacturing.

    以更少的劳力更好地支援农业生产
    临海社办工业大闹技术革新
    劳动生产率提高半倍　秋收冬种农具修制迅速
    据浙江日报消息　临海县各社办工厂在抽调劳动力充实农业生产第一线的同时，大搞技术革新，人人力争“一顶几”，保证按时按质按量完成秋收冬种的农具修制任务。
    临海县各公社党委坚决贯彻执行党的大办农业、大办粮食的指示，经过统筹安排，从社办工业中抽调了大批劳动力加强农业生产第一线。为了使社办工业在节约劳力的情况下，做好当前秋收冬种农具修制工作，这个县许多公社的党委都切实加强了社办工业的政治思想工作和生产组织工作，从总结前一阶段社办工业支援农业生产工作入手，评选了先进生产者，树立了标兵，发动职工开展了“一顶几”的竞赛。
    各社办工厂为了以更少的劳力，更好地支援农业生产，都大闹技术革新，狠挖增产节约潜力。如花园竹器厂首先在锯竹、剖竹、劈蔑等工序革新了技术，接着抓住编织这一薄弱环节，大搞革新，制成了木质编箩机等工具，编织出来的农具质量很好，而劳动力比原来节省了二十个，编织工实现了“一顶三”。亭旁公社机械厂在推广了动力机一机多用的先进经验以后，做到一台动力机带动二十四台机器，七十八个人完成了原来二百三十四个人的工作量。一个月来，全县社办工业实现的革新项目达四百四十八项，平均工效提高一倍到五倍。
    通过大闹技术革新，开展“一顶几”的劳动竞赛，这个县社办工业的生产技术水平迅速提高。现在，已有60％的铁木竹工厂实现了“一顶几”，全县社办工业的劳动生产率提高了50％以上，大大加快了秋收冬种农具的修制进度。
