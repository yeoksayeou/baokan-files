Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, - Henan Province's coal transport volume is increasing month by month. On the basis of a 21.2% increase in the province's coal transport volume in September compared to August, the coal transported for metallurgy, electric power, and other industries, as well as civilian use, in the first ten days of October increased by another 40.4% compared to the same period in September.

In order to ensure the supply of coal for industries such as iron and steel and electric power, as well as civilian coal, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to establish coal dispatch and transportation headquarters in seven key coal mines to strengthen leadership over coal transportation work. The Yiluo Coal Mine, through measures such as adopting double-shift transportation and improving the vehicle integrity rate, increased the average daily coal transportation volume of the entire mine from 1,140 tons in August to 1,416 tons in September. The highest volume in late September reached 1,820 tons, and it has already exceeded 2,000 tons in the first ten days of October. Various mines have systematically adjusted their labor organization. In the Changge Transportation Team of the Jiaozuo Mine, after adopting the "double-shift transportation system" from 4:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 12:00 PM to 8:00 PM, the centralized transportation volume increased from 2,800 tons to 3,100 tons per month. Now, the province's transportation army is focusing on current transportation on one hand and preparing for cold weather on the other, to transport more coal to support iron and steel production and the living needs of urban and rural people.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, October 24th - Huainan Coal Mine workers are actively exploring the potential of internal mine transportation, so that transportation work closely follows the needs of coal mining and tunneling. In September, the mine car turnover rate of the entire mine increased from about seven times in August to about eight times, transporting more than 4,000 tons of coal and more than 400 tons of gangue per day on the original basis.

In the increase production and practice economy movement, the Huainan Coal Mine's recovery and tunneling progress has greatly accelerated, and the output of coal and gangue are increasing rapidly, urgently requiring transportation to keep up. Based on this new situation, the mine bureau leadership timely analyzed the various favorable conditions for improving transportation capacity and vigorously mobilized workers to carry out technological reforms. Therefore, significant results were achieved in a very short period of time. The Li Yi Mine transformed the ninety-meter-long flat car yard of the East Transport Lane into a sliding slope car yard, so that loaded coal cars can slide automatically, reducing the dwell time of each train in the yard from forty minutes to thirty minutes. The Bijiagang Mine universally added steel road plates at the track connection points, making the track straight, the mine car run smoothly, reducing resistance and preventing derailment, and increasing transportation capacity by 20%. Xie Yi Mine comprehensively reformed the contact signals of the transportation system, so that dispatchers can quickly understand traffic conditions and dispatch vehicles, better coordinating with coal mining production. The Xinzhuangzi Mine transportation workers, combined with the transportation reform work, comprehensively cleaned up the transportation roadways and ditches, so that the transportation roadway surfaces were free of mud, gangue, and wood, and the ditches were unobstructed, which not only improved transportation efficiency, but also effectively prevented mine car derailment accidents.

In order to transport more coal and faster, the entire mine's transportation workers closely cooperated and fought together from underground to above ground. After the electric car drivers Li Deqing, Liu Xueming, and Wu Guangzhong of Li Yi Mine launched a competition with each other, the number of coal trips from Well No. 1 to Well No. 2, a distance of 2,600 meters, increased from fourteen to seventeen every eight hours. In the competition, the electric car drivers Xu Qinglong, Zhang Liming, and Guo Baode of Datong Mine increased the number of coal trips in an 180-meter horizontal and nearly 2,000-meter-long roadway from thirty to forty per shift, and the driver Xu Qinglong also created a new record of forty-eight coal trips. The transportation dispatchers of each mine also enthusiastically participated in the competition, closely contacting the workers in the coal mining area and the electric car drivers, promptly and accurately understanding the coal storage volume in the mining area and the usage of mine cars, and flexibly carrying out dispatch. The dispatcher Zhang Kaizhi of Li Yi Mine accurately dispatched, ensuring that all the coal produced by the entire mine was transported out of the mining area in a timely manner, and the car turnover rate increased by 20%. The dispatcher of Xinzhuangzi Mine adopted the dispatch method of "guaranteeing the key points and taking care of the general," dispatching vehicles in a timely and reasonable manner, ensuring that the key coal mining team with a daily output of 1,000 tons was able to transport out as much as it produced, and the car turnover rate increased by 12%.

    河南运煤量不断上升
    淮南煤矿适应生产增长需要改革矿内运输
    新华社郑州电　河南省煤运量月月上升。全省煤炭运量在9月份比8月份提高21.2％的基础上，10月上旬为冶金、电力等工业和民用运输的煤炭，又比9月同期增加了40.4％。
    为了保证钢铁、电力等工业用煤和民用煤的供应，中共河南省委决定在七个重点煤矿成立了煤炭调运指挥部，加强对煤炭运输工作的领导。宜洛煤矿由于采取双班运输，提高车辆完好率等措施，全矿9月份煤炭的平均日运输量由8月的一千一百四十吨，提高到一千四百一十六吨，9月下旬最高达到一千八百二十吨，10月上旬已突破两千吨。各矿有计划地调整了劳动组织，在焦作矿集运的长葛运输队，采取早四点至十二点、十二点至二十点的“双班运输制”以后，集运量每月从二千八百吨上升到三千一百吨。现在全省运输大军，正一手抓当前运输，一手抓防寒准备工作，以运输更多的煤炭支援钢铁生产和城乡人民的生活用煤。
    新华社合肥24日电　淮南煤矿职工积极挖掘矿场内部运输潜力，使运输工作紧紧跟上采煤、掘进的需要。9月份全矿矿车周转率由8月份的七次左右提高到八次左右，平均每天在原有基础上多运煤炭四千多吨，多运?石四百多吨。
    在增产节约运动中，淮南煤矿的回采和掘进进度大大加快，出煤量和出?量都在迅速增加，迫切要求运输跟上去。矿务局领导方面根据这一新的情况，及时分析了提高运输能力的各种有利条件，大力发动职工进行技术改革。因此在很短的时间内就收到了显著效果。李一矿把东运道九十米长的平车场，改革成为滑坡车场，使装满煤炭的矿车可以自动滑行，每趟列车在车场的停留时间，由四十分钟缩短到三十分钟。毕家岗矿运输铁道接轨地点，普遍加设钢铁道板，使轨道平直，矿车行走平稳，减少了阻力和防止了掉道，运输能力提高20％。谢一矿全面改革运输系统的联系信号，调度员可以最迅速地了解行车情况和调度车辆，更好地配合采煤生产。新庄孜矿运输工人结合运输改革工作，全面清理了运输巷道和水沟，使运输巷道路面无泥水、无?石、无木料，水沟畅通，不仅提高了运输效率，也有效地防止了矿车掉道事故。
    全矿运输职工为了多运煤，快运煤，从井下到地上都密切配合，协同作战。李一矿电车司机李德清、刘学明和武光忠，互相开展竞赛后，从一号井到二号井二千六百米长距离内，由每八小时运煤十四趟增加到十七趟。大通矿电车司机徐庆龙、张立明、郭宝德在竞赛中，一百八十米水平近二千米长的巷道，每班由运煤三十趟增加到四十趟，司机徐庆龙还创造了运煤四十八趟的新纪录。各个矿井的运输调度员也都热烈投入竞赛，密切与采煤区工人和电车司机联系，及时准确地了解采区存煤量和矿车使用情况，灵活进行调度。李一矿调度员张开志，准确调度，保证全矿生产的煤炭都及时运出采区，车皮周转率提高20％。新庄孜矿调度员采用“保证重点，照顾一般”的调度方法，及时合理地调度车辆，保证全矿日产千吨的重点采煤队每天生产多少就运出多少，车皮周转率提高12％。
