Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, 24th: Brazilian Social Democratic Party legislator Pedro Castro Costa suggested on the 21st in the Chamber of Deputies in Brasilia, the Brazilian capital, to establish a mixed company named "Brasilia Refrigeration Company" by expropriating American refrigeration companies such as "Wilson," "Swift," and "Armour," as well as the British refrigeration company "Angra."

When stating the reasons for this motion, Castro Costa said, "The continuously increasing pressure exerted by these foreign refrigeration companies established in Brazil, whose sole purpose is to transport meat to foreign consumption centers, has made it impossible to truly and properly solve the problem of domestic meat supply to this day."

    巴西一议员
    要求征收美国冷藏公司
    新华社24日讯  里约热内卢消息：巴西社会民主党议员彼德罗·卡斯特罗·科斯塔21日在巴西首都巴西利亚的众议院建议通过征收“威尔逊”、“斯威夫特”和“阿摩尔”等美国冷藏公司以及“安格拉”英国冷藏公司的办法，来创立一个以“巴西利亚冷藏公司”命名的混合公司。
    卡斯特罗·科斯塔在申述这项动议的理由时说，“这些设立在巴西、其唯一的目的在于把肉类输往外国消费中心的外国冷藏公司所继续不断施加的日益增长的压力，使得真正合理而妥善地解决国内肉类供应问题迄今成为不可能。”
