Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th. The full text of Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech at the banquet held by Guangdong Province Governor Chen Yu to bid farewell to General Ne Win is as follows:

Respectable General Ne Win, distinguished Burmese guests, comrades, friends:

General Ne Win, Chief of Staff of the Defense Forces of the Union of Burma, and his wife, along with other distinguished Burmese guests, after participating in our country's 11th National Day celebrations and the signing ceremony of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, have paid friendly visits to Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou, visiting scenic spots and historical sites and industrial and agricultural construction sites in various places. Wherever General Ne Win and his wife went, they sowed the seeds of "Pauk-Phaw" (fraternal) friendship. They spoke highly of the achievements our country has made since the Great Leap Forward during their visits. Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people. I am very happy to have had the opportunity to accompany General Ne Win on visits to various places.

General, distinguished Burmese guests, you can see during your visit that, thanks to the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, Sino-Burmese friendship has blossomed in many parts of our country. Now, the kinship-like friendship between China and Burma is growing day by day.

Both China and Burma are peace-loving countries, advocating peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems on the basis of the Five Principles. However, some countries in the world still refuse to recognize the People's Republic of China and are even afraid to recognize it. They are even afraid of leaders of various countries meeting each other and making contact. The leaders of some countries, even if they have the opportunity to meet, find it difficult to have serious discussions on issues of mutual concern and achieve fruitful negotiations. This is because they themselves have neither the confidence nor the sincerity to adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and to resolve international disputes through friendly consultation.

In contrast, the leaders of peace-loving Asian and African countries have made many friendly mutual visits and have achieved considerable results. In particular, the national leaders of China and Burma have made frequent friendly mutual visits in recent years, and the results have been extremely fruitful. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai has paid four friendly visits to Burma since 1954. Prime Minister U Nu has made four visits to China, General Ne Win has made three visits to our country, and former Prime Minister U Ba Swe has also made two visits. These visits and personal contacts have not only enhanced mutual understanding but also made great contributions to the development of Sino-Burmese friendship. Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win were received by Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Liu Shaoqi during their visit to China this time, and met with Premier Zhou Enlai, holding several cordial and friendly talks with Premier Zhou Enlai, and each talk yielded results. Through the talks, issues of mutual concern were satisfactorily resolved. In the current world situation of Cold War stalemate, Sino-Burmese friendship shines brightly, providing a new path for international friendship and cooperation, which is worthy of our praise and cheers.

All peace-loving people around the world warmly welcome the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, while a small handful of imperialist elements and their followers who pursue policies of war and aggression are very unhappy. Let them weep in their corners!

Dear Burmese guests, as we celebrate the great development of Sino-Burmese friendly relations, we cannot fail to mention the efforts and contributions made by General Ne Win to enhance the friendship between China and Burma. At the beginning of this year, when General Ne Win served as Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, he signed the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression with our government, and also signed the Sino-Burmese Agreement on Boundary Issues, paving the way for the rapid and smooth resolution of the boundary issue. However, when General Ne Win mentions Sino-Burmese friendship, he always first praises the efforts and contributions made by Prime Minister U Nu. We admire General Ne Win's spirit of unity and wish that this spirit of unity will continue to be carried forward, and this spirit of unity will surely benefit the Burmese people.

Due to the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the two countries' boundary treaty, it symbolizes that the building of Sino-Burmese friendship has been successfully established. We believe that through the continued efforts of the two governments and the two peoples, this building of peace and friendship will be consolidated and developed.

Tomorrow, General Ne Win and his wife, and other Burmese guests, will leave Guangzhou to return home. With a reluctant feeling of parting, we wish you, our respected Burmese guests, a safe journey, good health, and happiness.

Let us raise our glasses,

To the everlasting kinship-like Sino-Burmese friendship,

For peace in Asia and the world,

To the health of General Ne Win and his wife, and other Burmese guests present,

To the health of Prime Minister U Nu,

Cheers!

    在陈郁省长欢送奈温将军的宴会上
    陈毅副总理的讲话
    新华社广州12日电　陈毅副总理在广东省省长陈郁欢送奈温将军宴会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的奈温将军阁下，尊敬的缅甸贵宾们，同志们，朋友们：
    缅甸联邦国防军总参谋长奈温将军阁下和夫人及其他缅甸贵宾们，在参加了我国国庆十一周年庆祝活动和中缅边界条约签字仪式以后，到我国南京、无锡、苏州、上海、杭州、广州进行了友好访问，参观了各地的名胜古迹和工农业建设，所到之处都受到了各界人民的热烈欢迎。奈温将军和夫人在各地撒播了“胞波”情谊的种子。他们在访问中对我国在大跃进以来所取得的成就，给予很高的评价，在这里，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民表示衷心的感谢。我有机会陪同奈温将军到各地访问，感到非常高兴。
    将军阁下，缅甸贵宾们，你们在访问中可以看到由于中缅边界条约的签订，中缅友谊在我国许多地方已经开放了花朵。现在中缅两国亲戚般的友谊，正在与日俱增。
    中缅两国都是爱好和平的国家，主张不同社会制度的国家在五项原则的基础上和平共处。但是，世界上有些国家竟仍然不承认中华人民共和国，并且害怕承认中华人民共和国。他们甚至害怕各国领导人互相见面，进行接触。有些国家的领导人，即使有机会见了面，也难于就彼此关心的问题进行认真的商讨，使谈判获得成果。这是因为他们自己对奉行和平共处五项原则和通过友好协商解决国际争端，既没有信心，也没有诚意。
    与此相反，爱好和平的亚非国家的领导人却进行了多次的相互的友好访问，取得了不少的成果。特别是我们中缅两国的国家领导人在最近几年中进行了频繁的相互友好访问，成果极为丰硕。我国周恩来总理从1954年以来，已经对缅甸进行过四次友好访问。吴努总理对中国进行了四次访问，奈温将军对我国进行了三次访问，前总理吴巴瑞先生也进行过两次访问。这些访问和个人接触，不仅增进了相互的了解，且对发展中缅友好事业作出了巨大的贡献。吴努总理和奈温将军这次到中国访问，受到了毛泽东主席、刘少奇主席的接见，会见了周恩来总理，同周恩来总理进行了多次亲切友好的会谈，每次会谈都获得了成果。通过会谈，使双方关心的问题获得了圆满的解决。在当前冷战僵持的世界局势中中缅友谊却大放光明，为国际间友谊合作提供了新轨道，值得我们称道和欢呼。
    全世界一切爱好和平的人民都热烈欢呼中缅边界条约的签订，一小撮奉行战争和侵略政策的帝国主义分子及其追随者却大为不高兴，那么就让他们向隅而泣吧！
    亲爱的缅甸贵宾们，在我们欢庆中缅友好关系大发展的时候，我们不能不提到奈温将军阁下对增进中缅两国友谊所作的努力和贡献。奈温将军在今年年初在他担任缅甸联邦总理的时候，同我国政府签订了中缅友好互不侵犯条约，同时还签订了中缅关于边界问题的协定，为迅速而顺利地解决边界问题铺平了道路。但是奈温将军在提到中缅友谊的时候，总是首先推崇吴努总理所作的努力和贡献。我们钦佩奈温将军这种团结精神，并且祝愿这种团结精神继续发扬光大，这种团结精神定会造福于缅甸人民。
    由于中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和两国边界条约的签订，象征着中缅友谊的大厦已经成功地建立起来了。我们相信，通过两国政府和两国人民的继续努力，这座和平友谊大厦必将得到巩固和发展。
    明天，奈温将军阁下和夫人，及其他缅甸贵宾们就要离开广州回国，我们怀着依依不舍的惜别心情，祝你们，我们尊敬的缅甸贵宾们，一路平安，身体健康，精神愉快。
    让我们举杯，
    为亲戚般的中缅友谊万古长青，
    为亚洲和世界和平，
    为奈温将军阁下和夫人，以及在座的其他缅甸贵宾的健康，
    为吴努总理阁下的健康，
    干杯！
