    “Foolishness” and “Cleverness”
    Tang Xiaoding
    After reading Xing Yanzi's article (《China Youth》1960, No. 18), I especially thought about her “foolishness.”

    “You are literate, why do you stay at home wielding a hoe instead of going out to find a job?” “The village is in such difficulty now (due to the flood), why not go out and enjoy life? You're a pretty clever girl, why be so foolish!” How should one answer such tempting words? Xing Yanzi very simply replied: “I am willing to be such a ‘foolish’ girl.”

    Being literate and staying in the countryside is already “foolish” enough, but to say that one is willing to be such a “foolish” girl is perhaps “foolishness” compounded?

    How to be a “pretty clever” person? It is said that one should leave the countryside and go to the city. However, Xing Yanzi has a stubborn “foolish” streak and is unwilling to do so.

    This accusation of “foolishness” reflects the views of some people in society. They use various phrases to criticize educated youth for staying in the countryside. Such as “no future,” “no prospects,” “a waste of talent,” “a big fish in a small pond,” “why use both a small pen and a big pen (hoe),” “having studied to become a peasant is worse than being illiterate,” and so on, endlessly. Doesn't socialist society have capitalist remnants? This is one manifestation of them.

    “Foolishness” and “cleverness” should have an objective standard. If the standard is not uniform, then “each will have their own version of the truth.” Those who think that only “fools” among educated youth are willing to stay in the countryside may verbally acknowledge that “labor is glorious,” but in reality, they greatly despise labor, especially physical labor. Physical labor is the primary need of human life and the foundation of mental labor. Without physical labor, there would be no productive enterprises, no material wealth, and human society would be unable to survive. Then what would become of intellectuals and their knowledge? In class society, physical labor and mental labor are antagonistic: “Those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others.” The exploiting classes despise physical labor, despise the workers and peasants engaged in physical labor, and do their best to promote “all occupations are base, only studying is noble.” Under the socialist system, the antagonism between physical labor and mental labor has disappeared, and the differences between them will gradually diminish. However, the idea of ​​despising physical labor and viewing it as base still remains in the minds of some people. This is precisely the filth left over from the exploiting classes.

    “Study to become an official, become an official to get rich” was the purpose of many parents sending their children to school in the old society. Today, there are no such “officials.” Revolutionary cadres are not “officials,” but servants of the people. Doing revolutionary work is not for personal enrichment, but for building socialism and communism. Whether in government agencies, at the grassroots level, or among the masses, cadres must participate in physical labor, farming, raising pigs, carrying manure, chopping firewood, pulling carts, using cattle, they can do anything. Literary and artistic workers and scientists must also participate in physical labor. Combining education with productive labor, many schools have also established factories. These literate people use both a small pen and a “big pen.” The intellectualization of workers and peasants and the laborization of intellectuals are fundamental characteristics and trends of socialism. Those “Confuciuses” who are “unable to use their four limbs and unable to distinguish the five grains” are merely laughable antiques in real life. To insist that educated youth engaged in productive labor in the countryside are “foolish” is to be too ignorant of socialist trends. Of China's more than 600 million people, 500 million are farmers, and many others who are not farmers also participate in agricultural production or voluntarily request to be transferred from the city to the countryside. Are so many people all “foolish”?

    Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Some “clever people” have forgotten this. Marx said: “Agricultural labor productivity exceeding the individual needs of laborers is the foundation of all societies.” Some people who are supposedly knowledgeable often ignore this meaning. Grain, many industrial raw materials, the labor force that must be supplemented for the development of industry, the market for industrial products, a large part of the funds for industrial construction, and many foreign trade goods all depend on agriculture, all depend on the development of agriculture. Isn't agriculture important? Xing Yanzi recognizes the importance of agriculture, so she has the courage to say: “I am willing to be such a ‘foolish’ girl.”

    The vast majority of Chinese farmers have been “illiterate” for generations. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao led the people of the whole country in decades of revolution, overthrew the reactionaries, and realized socialism, only then did the situation of educated youth becoming farmers begin to appear. Chinese farmers will gradually transform from "illiterate" farmers into new types of farmers with modern cultural and scientific knowledge. The consolidation and development of rural people's communes, the continuous victory of socialism and communism in the countryside, the technical transformation of agriculture, the affluence, civilization, and happiness of people's lives all require the efforts of the vast number of educated youth with revolutionary “foolishness” like Xing Yanzi and the "Yanzi Shock Brigade."

    The countryside is not a “small pond,” but a large lake, a large river, a vast ocean, a great sea. It can not only accommodate "big fish," but also accommodate any dragons. In the process of agricultural modernization, young people only have knowledge that is not enough, only the possibility of gaining unlimited knowledge, only the possibility of being both red and expert, and there is absolutely no knowledge that cannot be used, unless it is false knowledge divorced from practice. The countryside needs educated youth, and educated youth should learn from Xing Yanzi and go to the countryside with the revolutionary determination of not being afraid of being called “foolish.” The dividing line between “foolishness” and “cleverness” lies in the understanding of truth: understanding the truth is clever, not understanding the truth is foolish; wholeheartedly serving socialism is clever, blindly pursuing personal enjoyment is foolish. Being content with agricultural production, as Xing Yanzi said to the Party branch secretary, "determined to work in the countryside for a lifetime," is not foolish, but extremely true cleverness, an awareness of the laws of socialist social development, an enthusiasm for building a new socialist and communist countryside, and loyalty to the people. Those who insist that educated youth participating in the agricultural front are somewhat “foolish” think they are clever, but in fact they are “talking about trivial matters and fond of petty cleverness.”

### “傻”和“精”

    “傻”和“精”
    唐小丁
    看了邢燕子的文章（《中国青年》1960年第十八期），特别想到她的“傻”。
    “你是识文断字的，为什么在家里扛锄把，不出去找个工作做？”“现在咱村这么困难（遭了水灾），为啥不出去享福。挺精个丫头，怎么傻起来了！”对这种诱动人心的话，该怎样回答才好呢？邢燕子很干脆：“我就愿意当这样的‘傻’丫头。”
    能识文断字，留在农村，已经够“傻”了，还说自己愿意当这样的“傻”丫头，也许是“傻”上加“傻”吧？
    要做“挺精”的人，怎么办呢？据说，应该离开农村，到城市去。然而，邢燕子偏偏有一股“傻”劲，不愿意那样。
    这个“傻”的责难，反映了社会上一部分人的观念。他们用了各种词令，来责难知识青年留在农村。什么“没有前途”呀，“没有出息”呀，“人材可惜”呀，“大鱼落在小塘里”呀，“拿了小笔杆为啥还拿大笔杆（锄头）”呀，“读了书当庄稼汉，还不如一直当黑眼窝（文盲）”呀，诸如此类，不一而足。社会主义社会不是存在着资本主义残余吗？这就是表现之一。
    “傻”与“精”，该有个客观的标准，标准不一，就会是“公说公有理、婆说婆有理”。认为知识青年中的“傻子”才肯留在农村的人，口头上也许是承认“劳动光荣”的，实际上却十分轻视劳动，尤其是体力劳动。体力劳动，是人类生活的第一需要，也是脑力劳动的基础。没有体力劳动，就没有任何生产事业，没有任何物质财富，人类社会就无法生存下去，那还有什么知识分子及其知识呢？在阶级社会里，体力劳动同脑力劳动带有对抗的性质，“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”。剥削阶级轻视体力劳动，轻视从事体力劳动的工农群众，尽力宣扬“万般皆下品，惟有读书高”。在社会主义制度下，体力劳动同脑力劳动的对抗已经消失，它们之间的差别也会逐步地缩小。但是，轻视体力劳动、视体力劳动为下贱的思想，还残存在一部分人的头脑中。这正是剥削阶级遗留下来的污秽。
    “读书当官，当官发财”，是旧社会里许多人送子弟入学的目的。如今，没有那样的“官”了。革命干部不是什么“官”，而是人民的勤务员。做革命工作不是为了个人发财，而是为了建设社会主义和共产主义。干部无论在机关、在基层、在群众中，都要参加体力劳动，种地、养猪、担粪、打柴、拉车、使牛，什么都可以干。文艺家和科学家，都要参加体力劳动。教育与生产劳动相结合，许多学校也办了工厂，这些识文断字的人，都是既拿小笔杆，也拿“大笔杆”。工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化，这是社会主义的一个根本的特点和趋势。那种“四体不勤、五谷不分”的“夫子”，在现实生活中只能是可笑的古董了。把知识青年在农村从事生产劳动，一口咬定“傻”，未免太不识社会主义的时务。全中国六亿多人口，有五亿是农民，还有很多人不是农民，但也参加了农业生产，或者自动要求从城市调到农村去，这么多的人都“傻”吗？
    农业是国民经济的基础。有的“聪明人”却把这一点忘记了。马克思说：“超越于劳动者个人需要的农业劳动生产率，是一切社会的基础”。有的据说是大有知识的人，却往往不理会这个意思。粮食、许多工业原料、发展工业必须补充的劳动力、工业品的市场、工业建设的很大一部分资金、以及不少外贸物资，都要靠农业，都要靠农业的发展，难道农业还不重要吗？邢燕子认识到了农业的重要，所以她有勇气说：“我就愿意当这样的‘傻’丫头。”
    中国农民中绝大多数人祖祖辈辈都是“黑眼窝”。共产党和毛主席领导全国人民，闹了几十年的革命，打倒了反动派，实现了社会主义，才开始出现了知识青年当农民的局面。中国农民，将由“黑眼窝”的农民，逐步变成新型的具有现代文化科学知识的农民了。农村人民公社巩固和发展，社会主义、共产主义在农村的不断胜利，农业的技术改造，人们生活的富裕，文明和幸福，都需要像邢燕子和“燕子突击队”那样的有革命“傻”劲的广大知识青年的努力。
    农村不是“小塘”，而是大湖、大江、大海、大洋。它不仅能容下“大鱼”，而且能容下任何蛟龙。在农业现代化的过程中，青年们只有不够用的知识，只有获得无限知识的可能，只有又红又专的可能，绝没有用不了的知识，除非是脱离实践的假知识。农村需要知识青年，知识青年要学习邢燕子，要带着邢燕子那样的不怕别人说“傻”的革命坚定性到农村去。“傻”和“精”的分界线，在于对真理的认识：懂得真理，才是精；不懂得真理，才是傻；一心为社会主义的才是精，一味追求个人生活享受的才是傻。安心农业生产，像邢燕子对党支部书记说的那样，“决心在农村干一辈子”，不是傻，而是极大的真正的聪明，是对于社会主义社会发展规律的觉悟，是对于建设社会主义、共产主义新农村的热忱，是对于人民的忠心。硬说知识青年参加农业战线是有几分“傻气”的人，自以为聪明，实际上是“言不及义，好行小慧”。
