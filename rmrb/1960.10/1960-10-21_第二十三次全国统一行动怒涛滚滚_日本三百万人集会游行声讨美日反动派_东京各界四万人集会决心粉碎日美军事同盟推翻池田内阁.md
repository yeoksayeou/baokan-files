Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th - Approximately three million people throughout Japan held a massive twenty-third national unified action today, resolutely opposing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," protesting the assassination of Asanuma by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, and demanding the Ikeda Cabinet resign en masse.

Workers from various industrial sectors belonging to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the Federation of Independent Unions, along with people from all walks of life, held protest rallies, workplace meetings, and demonstrations in various locations this afternoon.

In Tokyo, despite the whistling cold wind today, 40,000 workers, students, cultural figures, and business people gathered at Miyakezaka Plaza for a national rally against the new "Security Treaty" and to protest the assassination of Asanuma.

The assembly adopted a declaration. The declaration stated that the participants were determined to rise up and smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty that encourages fascists, overthrow the Ikeda Cabinet, and purge from the political arena those reactionary politicians and reactionary judges who played an important role in forcibly passing the new "Security Treaty."

The assembly also passed resolutions demanding the resignation of the Ikeda Cabinet and the dismissal of the Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police Department, and pledged to take action to thwart the government's conspiracy to punish active participants in the struggle against the new "Security Treaty," to shatter the U.S.-Japan military alliance system and reactionary rule, and to fight for peace and democracy.

The widow of the late Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma, Kyoko Asanuma, spoke on stage holding Asanuma's urn. She called on progressive forces to unite and strive for victory in the upcoming general election. She said that she had overcome her grief and would fight alongside the Socialist Party in the struggle to build a peaceful country.

Mrs. Asanuma expressed her anger at the Ikeda government and the Liberal Democratic Party in strong terms.

Representatives from various circles spoke at the meeting. They all expressed their determination to inherit the legacy of the assassinated Socialist Party Chairman Asanuma and continue the fight.

Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, Sanzo Nosaka, emphasized that the real culprits in Asanuma's assassination were U.S. imperialism and the Japanese monopoly capitalist group. Nosaka stressed: "The very fact that they have to resort to terrorist means thoroughly shows how weak they have become. It is not impossible, if we mobilize all the democratic forces in the country, to deal a fatal blow to the resurgent militarism and fascism."

Socialist Party representative Hideo Yamahana called on the participants to do their utmost to ensure that the democratic forces win in the upcoming general election.

Takefu Tohe, head of the Japanese delegation to the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" who had just returned from a visit to China, said: "Asanuma strived to restore diplomatic relations with China." Tohe emphasized: "We must continue to complete the task he left behind. We must move forward along the path he pointed out."

After the meeting, the participants held a lantern parade in Tokyo, holding high their banners. The placards in their hands read: "We oppose the resurgence of militarism!" "Down with fascism!" "Let us hold a general strike to express our anger!" (Attached picture)

    第二十三次全国统一行动怒涛滚滚
    日本三百万人集会游行声讨美日反动派
    东京各界四万人集会决心粉碎日美军事同盟推翻池田内阁
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本各地共约三百万人今天举行了声势浩大的第二十三次全国统一行动，坚决反对新日美“安全条约”，抗议美日反动派杀害浅沼，要求池田内阁总辞职。
    属于日本工会总评议会和中立工会联合会的各个产业部门工会的工人和其他各界人民，今天下午在各地举行了抗议大会、工作场所大会和示威游行。
    在东京，尽管今天寒风呼啸，四万名工人、学生、文化界人士和工商界人士在三宅坂广场举行了反对新“安全条约”、抗议杀害浅沼国民大会。
    大会通过了宣言。宣言说，与会者决心起来粉碎鼓励法西斯分子的日美军事同盟条约，推翻池田内阁，并且从政界清洗那些在强行通过新“安全条约”方面起了重要作用的反动政客和反动法官。
    大会还通过了要求池田内阁下台和罢免警视总监的决议，并保证采取行动来粉碎政府要惩罚反对新“安全条约”斗争的积极参加者的阴谋，粉碎日美军事同盟体制和反动统治，为争取和平和民主而斗争。
    已故社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎的夫人浅沼享子抱着浅沼的骨灰盒上台讲话。她呼吁进步力量团结一致，争取在即将举行的大选中获得胜利。她说，她克服了悲痛，将在争取建立一个和平的国家的斗争中同社会党一道进行战斗。
    浅沼夫人用强烈的措词表示她对池田政府和自由民主党的愤怒。
    各界代表在大会上讲话。他们都表示决心要继承被杀害的社会党委员长浅沼的遗志，继续进行战斗。
    日本共产党主席野坂参三强调指出：刺杀浅沼的真正凶犯是美帝国主义和日本垄断资本集团。野坂强调说：“他们不得不借助于恐怖手段这一事实本身就彻底表明他们已变得怎样软弱无力。假使我们把国内所有的民主力量动员起来，给予卷土重来的军国主义和法西斯主义以致命打击，并不是不可能的。”
    社会党代表山花秀雄呼吁与会者竭尽全力，使民主力量在即将举行的大选中获得胜利。
    刚刚访问中国归来的日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”代表团团长户叶武说：“浅沼竭力争取同中国恢复外交关系。户叶武强调说：“我们必须继续完成他遗留下来的任务。我们必须沿着他所指明的道路向前迈进”。
    大会结束后，与会者高举旗帜在东京市内举行了提灯游行。他们手里拿着的标语牌上写着：“我们反对军国主义卷土重来！”“打倒法西斯主义！”“让我们举行总罢工来表示我们的愤怒！”（附图片）
