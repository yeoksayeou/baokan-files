	Factories in Various Regions Support Agricultural Production in Tibet
	Workers in factories across the country are supporting Tibetan farmers in achieving a bumper harvest this year. Local state-owned agricultural machinery factories in Hebei, Shandong, Sichuan, Gansu, and many other provinces began manufacturing large quantities of production tools for the emancipated Tibetan farmers last year. When shipping new agricultural implements, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong, and other provinces also dispatched technicians to guide Tibetan farmers in learning how to use the new tools and teach them the skills to manufacture them. This year, Tibetan farmers have added nearly 200,000 various agricultural implements to their production, using new-style walking plows and mountain plows. Some areas have also started using seeders, threshers, and other machinery.
	
	Fengman Provides Safe Power Supply for Over 2,500 Days
	The Fengman Hydropower Station in Jilin Province has implemented the power industry production policy of "generating more electricity, supplying more electricity, safety and economy, and all-round leap forward," creating a record of 698 days without equipment accidents and 2,535 days of safe operation. At the same time, it has overfulfilled its power generation plan every day and every month.
	The main experience of this power station in safe production is: adhering to the system of regular maintenance and planned maintenance. Since the beginning of this year, it has also launched a "Hundred Incident Anticipation Movement," with all employees of the power station participating, each anticipating and identifying more than 12,000 unsafe factors in equipment defects, fire prevention, and poisoning, eliminating them in a timely manner to keep the power station in a safe environment forever.
	
	Yangquan Mine Organizes Ten-Day Campaigns to Promote High Output
	The Yangquan Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province has adopted the method of "organizing high-yield campaigns by the ten-day period" to promote the in-depth development of the increase production and practice economy movement, and a new situation of sustained leap forward has emerged in the bureau. This approach divides each month into ten-day segments, with each ten days being a campaign. The first seven days of each campaign focus on carrying out labor competitions to compare, learn, catch up, and help each other, striving to achieve high output. The last three days are used for rest, summary, evaluation, and exchange of experiences to consolidate high-yield results and prepare fully for the next campaign. Its advantage is that it closely combines shock production with preparatory work, enabling the labor competition to continue. Since September, four campaigns have been organized, and the daily output level of raw coal has been rising every ten-day period.
	
	Xinyang Area's Blast Furnaces and Indigenous Furnaces Leap Forward Together
	In the Xinyang area of Henan Province, workers on the iron and steel front have extensively and deeply carried out the red flag competition movement, with "small modern groups" targeting "1, 2, 9" (coke ratio of 1, utilization coefficient of 2, pass rate of 90%) and "small indigenous groups" targeting "1, 3, 9" (coke ratio of 1, utilization coefficient of 3, pass rate of 90%), and the area's steel production has soared. Compared with the same period before the movement in September, the average pig iron production of county-run and above "small modern groups" and "small indigenous groups" iron and steel plants increased by 52.36%, the average steel production increased by 71.7%, the pig iron pass rate increased by 34.1%, and the coke consumption per ton of iron decreased by 10.19%.
	
	Chongqing Transportation Workers Actively Conserve Fuel
	The vast number of workers on the transportation front in Chongqing, Sichuan Province, have launched a mass movement of "everyone saving fuel, every vehicle saving fuel, every ship saving fuel," and have achieved significant results. According to statistics up to September 15, 75% of the city's vehicles and ships have achieved fuel savings, and the average fuel consumption rate has decreased by 15%. Their approach is: to organize a fuel-saving experience promotion team of drivers, maintenance technicians, and cadres, to mobilize the masses to carry out fuel-saving activities; to run fuel-saving technical training courses, so that most new drivers master the advanced technology of fuel saving; through investigation and assessment, to rank vehicles and ships of the same model, same type, and same route and shipping line, to identify the typical vehicles and ships with the highest and lowest fuel consumption, and to calculate the accounts of high output, fuel consumption, and cost, so that workers further establish the concept of high output and fuel saving.

    要闻快报
    各地工厂支援西藏农业生产
    全国许多工厂的工人们支援西藏农民夺取今年农业生产丰收。河北、山东、四川、甘肃等许多省的地方国营农业机械厂，从去年就开始为翻身的西藏农民大量制造生产工具；江苏、江西、山东等省在运出新式农具时，还派出技术工人，指导西藏农民学习使用新工具和教给他们制造新工具的技术。今年藏族农民在生产中已新增加了近二十万件各种农具，用上了新式步犁和山地犁，有些地方还用上了播种机、脱粒机等。
    丰满安全供电两千五百多天
    吉林省丰满水电站贯彻“多发电，多供电，安全经济，全面跃进”的电业生产方针，创造了六百九十八天无设备事故，二千五百三十五天安全运行的纪录，同时日日、月月都超额完成发电计划。
    这个电站安全生产的主要经验是：坚持执行定期检修，计划检修的制度。今年以来，又开展了“百件事故预想运动”，全电站职工人人参加，个个预想，挖掘出设备缺陷、防火、防毒等方面的不安全因素达一万二千多件，及时消除，使电站永远处于安全的环境之中。
    阳泉矿组织旬战役促高产
    山西阳泉矿务局采取“分旬组织高产战役”的方法，推动增产节约运动逐步深入，全局出现了持续跃进的新局面。这种做法是每月按旬分段，十天一个战役，每个战役前七天集中力量开展比、学、赶、帮劳动竞赛，一个劲夺取高产；后三天进行休整、总结、评比、交流经验，巩固高产成果，为下一个战役做好充分准备。它的好处是：把突击生产和准备工作紧密地结合起来，使劳动竞赛持续开展。从九月到现在已组织了四次战役，原煤日产水平旬旬上升。
    信阳地区高炉土炉齐跃进
    河南信阳地区钢铁战线职工广泛深入地开展了钢铁“小洋群”以“一、二、九”（焦比一、利用系数二、合格率百分之九十）、“小土群”以“一、三、九”（焦比一、利用系数三、合格率百分之九十）为目标的红旗竞赛运动，全区钢铁产量扶摇直上。九月份与运动前同期比较，县营以上的“小洋群”、“小土群”钢铁厂，生铁产量平均提高百分之五十二点三六，钢产量平均提高百分之七十一点七，生铁合格率提高百分之三十四点一，吨铁耗焦量下降百分之十点一九。
    重庆运输职工积极节约用油
    四川重庆市交通运输战线广大职工，开展“人人节油、车车节油、船船节油”的群众运动，收到显著效果。据到九月十五日的统计，全市已有百分之七十五的车船做到节约用油，油耗率平均下降了百分之十五。他们的做法是：组织驾驶员、保修技工和干部“三结合”的节约用油经验推广队，发动群众开展节约用油活动；开办节约用油技术训练班，使大多数新驾驶员掌握了节约用油的先进技术；通过检查摸底，将同车型、同船型、同一路线和航线的车、船，进行排队，找出耗油量最高和最低的典型，算高产、油耗、成本账，使职工进一步树立高产节油思想。
