Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, October 10th: According to the Hungarian "People's Freedom" newspaper, the head of the Hungarian delegation to the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Kadar, spoke at the UN General Assembly plenary session on October 3rd, addressing the issue of the People's Republic of China's representation in the United Nations.

In his speech, Kadar said: If, through the abolition of the colonial system, all peoples capable of establishing independent lives were to obtain freedom, and their representatives were to occupy seats in the United Nations, then the universality of this organization could truly be realized. However, to talk about the universality of the United Nations, to say that it contains representatives of all mankind, before the representatives of the People's Republic of China, with a population of 680 million, have occupied their legitimate seats in the United Nations organization, is absurd. One only needs to think for a moment to understand that attempting to oppose the People's Republic of China occupying its place in the United Nations is opposing the realization of a comprehensive disarmament agreement. The spokesperson of the People's Republic of China is fully entitled to say that only international agreements that they participate in formulating are binding on them. The United Nations owes itself a debt, which is to put an end to the narrow, selfish, and harmful big-power policy that the United States' representative has been using for years to obstruct the People's Republic of China from occupying its legitimate seat in the United Nations. The delegations of all countries bear a significant responsibility for resolving this issue.

Kadar said: The British government has diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and its delegation is well aware that the so-called "Tibetan issue" is an artificial product of the "Cold War" and a slander against the People's Republic of China. At the same time, this issue has caused fierce divisions among the member states of the United Nations. Despite this, the British delegation in the General Committee still favored including the so-called "Tibetan issue" on the agenda of the General Assembly. On the other hand, it shamelessly opposed including the issue of restoring the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations on the agenda of the General Assembly, insisting that this issue would cause disputes and was not worth discussing, so as not to aggravate the atmosphere of the General Assembly. What is going on here? The British delegation is not afraid that discussing the so-called "Tibetan issue" will cause new divisions, but is only worried that discussing the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations will make the atmosphere tense.

Kadar pointed out: The issue of China's representation in the United Nations is like a ripe fruit, and therefore must be resolved quickly. The resolution of this issue will only enhance the prestige of the United Nations and increase the effectiveness of the United Nations' discussions and the strength of its resolutions. Our delegation advocates for the restoration of the rights of the People's Republic of China and supports the proposal to admit the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations.

### 卡达尔在联大全体会议上发言  主张恢复中国在联合国的代表权

    卡达尔在联大全体会议上发言
    主张恢复中国在联合国的代表权
    新华社布达佩斯10日电　据匈牙利“人民自由报”报道，匈牙利出席联合国大会第十五届会议代表团团长卡达尔10月3日在联合国大会全体会议上发言，谈到了中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权问题。
    卡达尔在他的发言中说：如果由于取消殖民主义制度，所有能够建立独立生活的人民都将获得自由，他们的代表在联合国都占有席位，那么，这一组织的普遍性才能真正实现。但是，在拥有六亿八千万人口的中华人民共和国的代表没有在联合国组织中占有他们合法的席位以前，谈论什么联合国具有普遍性，说什么在其中有整个人类的代表，这是荒谬的。只要想一想就会立刻明白，企图反对中华人民共和国占有它在联合国中的地位，这就是反对全面裁军协议的实现。中华人民共和国的发言人完全有权这样说：只有他们参加制订的国际协定才对他们有约束力。联合国欠了自己一笔债，这就是终止狭隘的、自私的、有害的大国政策，美国的代表多年以来正以这个政策来阻挠中华人民共和国占有它在联合国中的合法席位。各国代表团都对这个问题的解决负有重大的责任。
    卡达尔说：英国政府同中华人民共和国有外交关系，它的代表团很清楚，所谓“西藏问题”是人为的“冷战”产物，是对中华人民共和国的诬蔑。同时，这个问题在联合国会员国中引起了激烈的分歧。尽管如此，但是，英国代表团在总务委员会中还是赞成把所谓“西藏问题”列入联大议程。另一方面，它又恬不知耻地反对把恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的问题列入大会议程，硬说这个问题会引起争论，因而不值得讨论，以免加剧大会的气氛。这是怎么一回事？英国代表团并不害怕由于讨论所谓“西藏问题”会引起新的分歧，却只是担心讨论恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位会使气氛紧张起来。
    卡达尔指出：中国在联合国的代表权问题就像熟透了的果实一样，因此必须迅速解决。这个问题的解决只会提高联合国的威望，增加联合国讨论的效果及其决议的力量。我国代表团主张恢复中华人民共和国的权利，并且支持吸收蒙古人民共和国加入联合国的建议。
