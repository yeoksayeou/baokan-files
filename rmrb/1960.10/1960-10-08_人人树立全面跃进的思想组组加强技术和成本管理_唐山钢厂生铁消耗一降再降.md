Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, 7th: Tangshan Steel Plant deeply mobilized the masses to tap the internal potential of the enterprise, and continuously reduced the pig iron consumption in converter steelmaking, realizing more steel with less iron. In September, the average pig iron consumption per ton of steel in the whole plant decreased from 1329.91 kilograms in August to 1271.7 kilograms. Among them, the average pig iron consumption per ton of steel in the first steelmaking workshop in September was 1150 kilograms, and in the third steelmaking workshop it was 1103 kilograms. Because the amount of pig iron used in steelmaking was greatly reduced, it promoted an all-round and sustained leap forward in steel production. The average daily output of steel ingots in September increased by 19.2% compared with August, the qualification rate of steel ingots reached 98.29%, and the cost also decreased significantly.

		Detailed Accounting Reveals Huge Potential
    Leading cadres at all levels of Tangshan Steel Plant have established the thought of an overall leap forward, grasping both high quality and high output, and low consumption and low cost. Since the beginning of this year, pig iron consumption has been continuously reduced. From January to August, the average iron consumption per ton of steel was 231 kilograms lower than the same period last year. In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, in order to further reduce the iron consumption of steelmaking and increase the production of more steel, the factory Party committee conducted in-depth and meticulous education on increasing production and practicing economy among all employees. They focused on three calculations. The first is the advanced level account. There is a large difference in the pig iron consumption indicators of each workshop, class, and group. The third steelmaking workshop consumes 1123 kilograms of pig iron per ton of steel, while some workshops consume as much as 1300 kilograms; the steelmaking groups of Wang Yiyuan and Xie Qinghai in the first steelmaking workshop often maintain the iron consumption per ton of steel below 1100 kilograms, while general groups use 1250 kilograms. If the backward workshops and groups catch up with the advanced level, pig iron consumption can be greatly reduced. Second, they calculated the account of improving quality and reducing accidents. Although the qualification rate of steel ingots in the whole plant has reached more than 98%, there are still a certain number of defective products, and there are accidents such as iron running and steel leakage, which affect the failure of pig iron consumption to decline rapidly. According to the experience created by many advanced classes and groups, it is entirely possible to eliminate the occurrence of these accidents and improve the quality of steel. Third, they calculated the account of the significance of savings. If the iron consumption of the whole plant reaches the level of the third steelmaking workshop, the pig iron saved every day is equivalent to the daily output of more than 30 small blast furnaces. This not only has many benefits for the steel plant itself to reduce costs and increase output, but also can save a lot of manpower and material resources in mining, coal mining, coking, ironmaking, and transportation, and has a significant effect on accelerating the development of the iron and steel industry. Through accounting, the workers have further recognized the significance of saving pig iron and increasing steel production, and have seen the huge potential of production.

		Competition to Win the Title of Saving Champion
    Workers in various processes such as converters, iron melting furnaces, and ingot making worked together to reduce pig iron consumption and launched a competition. The Wang Yiyuan steelmaking group, which has always maintained the title of "champion" in high yield, high quality, and low consumption, took the lead after proposing a competition initiative to all employees. They adopted methods of adding less lime, surface blowing, and early slagging to increase the temperature of molten steel and shorten the smelting time. At the same time, they developed a method of consuming a large amount of scrap steel, so that pig iron consumption reached a new level, using only 885 kilograms of iron to produce one ton of steel. After the news came out, it shocked the workers of the whole plant. They quickly caught up and set off a competition upsurge of everyone learning, each group comparing, and each furnace catching up with the Wang Yiyuan group. Workers in the Ma Guangzong group sent people to the Wang Yiyuan group to learn advanced operating experience, re-examined the measures, implemented furnace-by-furnace calculation of blowing loss, class-by-class calculation of consumption, and created a record of 436 consecutive furnaces without defective products since August, with the average iron consumption per ton of steel reduced to 1060 kilograms. Up to now, the iron consumption per ton of steel in 30% of the steelmaking groups in the whole plant has been reduced to below 1100 kilograms. In the competition, workers in the iron melting furnace, ingot making and other processes worked together, controlled each link, and actively created good conditions for using less iron and producing more steel. The workers of the three shifts of No. 5 iron melting furnace in the first steelmaking workshop cooperated closely, unified operation, made the iron melting furnace eat "fine food", the furnace did not stop the wind, frequently ventilated the eyes, kept the wind eyes bright and unobstructed, and created a new record of 262 furnaces without accidents, supplying the converter with sufficient high-temperature and low-sulfur molten iron.
		
		Summarize Experience and Strengthen Technical and Organizational Measures
    In the vigorous competition campaign, the factory, in view of the various key points of pig iron consumption, led by factory directors, Party committee secretaries, and other leading cadres, went deep into the front line of production, and through planting "experimental fields" and holding "three-in-one" professional meetings, summarized the experiences created by the masses, sorted them out, and summarized a set of technical and organizational measures, which were widely promoted in the whole factory, ensuring a substantial reduction in pig iron consumption. The main contents of these experiences are: (1) The iron melting furnace must ensure the supply of high-temperature and low-sulfur molten iron to the converter, creating conditions for reducing pig iron consumption in steelmaking. To this end, the iron melting furnace workers learned the experience of small blast furnace ironmaking, transformed the iron melting furnace, added blowers, increased the air volume, made the batching accurate, stabilized the sulfur content of the iron, kept the iron blocks, coke, and flux uniform in size, free of impurities, and ensured good air permeability and normal furnace conditions, achieving large air volume, high temperature, and fine material operation. A waste oil brick adding group was established to be specifically responsible for adding waste oil bricks to the iron melting furnace to improve the desulfurization effect. In addition, the workers have also made many improvements in the operation methods to reduce accidents such as iron running and air leakage, so that the iron melting furnace wind eyes are bright and the wind pressure is maintained at 90 to 110 degrees. As a result of the above measures, the temperature of the molten iron supplied to steelmaking has increased from about 1350 degrees to 1370 degrees to 1400 degrees, and the desulfurization efficiency of the iron melting furnace has reached more than 70%.
	(2) Improve quality, produce no defective products, and reduce smelting losses in converter operation. To this end, the factory promoted a set of advanced operation methods, mainly based on the Wang Yiyuan steelmaking group, under the conditions of reducing and stabilizing the sulfur content of molten iron, thereby improving the temperature of molten steel and the efficiency of desulfurization in the early stage of slag removal, shortening the smelting time, and reducing the loss of molten iron splash. At the same time, steelmaking workers promoted pre-furnace judgment meetings, democratic steelmaking, and other methods to gather wisdom and reduce defective products and return furnace accidents. At present, the smelting time of each furnace of steel in the converter has generally been shortened from 47 minutes to 42 minutes, achieving reasonable blowing loss. Due to the improvement of the quality of steel ingots, in the upper and middle ten days of September, the same amount of pig iron was used to produce 1422 tons more steel than in the same period in August. In the process of converter blowing, the workers operated carefully and meticulously, paid attention to saving a little molten iron, and often maintained the furnace to avoid accidents such as steel running and steel leakage.
    (3) Improve the casting quality of steel ingots, reduce pouring surplus, and eliminate steel running and top steel accidents. In this regard, the advanced operating experience of the pouring worker Chang Weimin's skewed bag pouring was mainly summarized and promoted, the pouring speed was controlled according to the temperature of the molten steel, continuous fine-flow filling was adopted to avoid shrinkage cavity and subcutaneous bubble accidents of steel ingots, and no or less surplus molten steel was left in the steel bag. Many pouring groups have reduced the surplus molten steel per ton of steel to 0.01 kilograms on average.
    (4) Increase revenue and reduce expenditure, consume a large amount of scrap steel. In the steelmaking process, a certain amount of surplus molten steel, steel samples and iron samples for testing, and small steel ingots of non-standard length will always be produced. Although the quantity is not large, if they are fully utilized and returned to the furnace for smelting, the pig iron consumption can be reduced to a lower limit. Therefore, under the premise of trying to increase the temperature of molten steel and molten iron, the workers created a method of "four-part consumption of scrap steel", that is, adding an appropriate amount of scrap steel to the iron melting furnace, converter, molten iron bag, and molten steel bag, which not only greatly reduced the amount of pig iron consumed and reduced costs, but also increased steel production.
    
		Grasp Group Work and Implement Appraisal and Rewards
    While strengthening technical management, the factory highlighted the strengthening of group work. They mobilized workers to participate in planning and cost management, implemented group economic accounting, and established a mass appraisal and saving reward system. The groups compared shift by shift, the workshops and the whole factory compared day by day, and the results of workers' savings were announced in a timely manner, making the reduction of pig iron consumption a conscious action of the masses and promoting the in-depth and sustained development of the production increase and economy campaign. From the production workshop to the auxiliary departments, from the converter to the iron melting furnace, a new atmosphere has emerged in which everyone cares about costs and everyone is saving. The workers of the Xie Qinghai steelmaking group, in order to exceed the Wang Yiyuan group, the pacesetter of the whole plant, in terms of reducing iron consumption indicators, each had a savings account; the group leader Xie Qinghai and the cost accountant Li Zhaoyan almost went to work early every day to learn about the iron consumption indicators of other groups in the workshop and learn from others' experiences. In this way, the group's iron consumption indicators dropped sharply, and they won the championship of the whole plant in August.

    人人树立全面跃进的思想组组加强技术和成本管理
    唐山钢厂生铁消耗一降再降
    据新华社唐山7日电　唐山钢厂深入发动群众挖掘企业内部潜力，不断降低转炉炼钢的生铁消耗，实现了用较少的铁炼出更多的钢。9月份全厂平均每吨钢的生铁消耗，由8月份的一千三百二十九点九一公斤，降低到一千二百七十一点七公斤。其中第一炼钢车间9月份平均每吨钢的生铁消耗为一千一百五十公斤，第三炼钢车间为一千一百零三公斤。由于炼钢使用的生铁大大减少，促进了钢的生产全面持续跃进。9月份钢锭平均日产量比8月份增长19.2％，钢锭合格率达到98.29％，成本也显著下降。
                算细账看清巨大潜力
    唐山钢厂各级领导干部树立了全面跃进的思想，既抓优质高产，又抓低耗低成本。今年以来，生铁消耗不断降低，1至8月份，平均每吨钢的铁耗比去年同期降低二百三十一公斤。在增产节约运动中，为了进一步降低炼钢的耗铁量，增产更多的钢，工厂党委向全体职工进行了深入细致的增产节约教育。他们着重算了三笔账。首先是先进水平账。各车间、班、组生铁消耗指标高低相差较大，第三炼钢车间每吨钢耗用生铁一千一百二十三公斤，而有的车间高达一千三百公斤左右；第一炼钢车间王益元、谢清海等炼钢小组，每炼一吨钢的铁耗量经常保持在一千一百公斤以下，一般的小组要用一千二百五十公斤。如果后进车间、小组都赶上先进水平，生铁消耗可以大大降低。第二，算了提高质量、减少事故账。虽然全厂钢锭合格率达到98％以上，但仍然有一定数量的废品，有跑铁、漏钢等事故，影响生铁消耗不能迅速下降。根据不少先进班、组创造的经验，杜绝这些事故的发生，提高钢的质量，是完全可能的。第三，算了节约意义账。如果全厂铁耗都达到第三炼钢车间的水平，每天节约的生铁，就相当于三十多座小高炉的日产量，这不仅对钢厂本身降低成本、增加产量有许多好处，而且可以节约采矿、挖煤、炼焦、炼铁、运输等方面的大量人力、物力，对加速钢铁工业的发展也有重大作用。通过算账，职工们更认清了节约生铁跟增产钢的意义，看到了生产的巨大潜力。
                闹竞赛齐争节约冠军
    转炉、化铁炉、制锭等各个工序的职工齐心协力降低生铁消耗，并展开了竞赛。一贯保持高产、优质、低耗“冠军”称号的王益元炼钢小组，向全厂职工提出竞赛倡议以后，一马当先，采取了少加石灰、面吹、早化渣的方法，提高了钢水温度，缩短了冶炼时间，同时研究出大吃废钢的办法，使生铁消耗达到新的水平，只用八百八十五公斤铁就炼出一吨钢。这一消息传出以后，震动了全厂职工，他们急起直追，掀起了人人学、组组比、炉炉赶王益元小组的竞赛高潮。马广宗小组工人派人到王益元小组学习先进操作经验，重新研究了措施，实行了炉炉算吹损，班班算消耗，8月份以来创造了连续四百三十六炉无废品的纪录，平均每吨钢的铁耗降低到一千零六十公斤。到目前为止，全厂30％的炼钢小组每吨钢铁耗降低到一千一百公斤以下。在竞赛中，化铁炉、制锭等工序的工人，通力协作，环环把关，积极为少用铁、多产钢创造良好条件。第一炼钢车间五号化铁炉三个班的工人紧密配合，统一操作，作到了化铁炉吃“细粮”，炉内不停风，勤通风眼，保持了风眼只只明亮畅通，创造了二百六十二炉无事故的新纪录，给转炉供应了充足的高温低硫铁水。
              总结经验加强技术组织措施
    在轰轰烈烈的竞赛运动中，这个厂针对生铁消耗的各个关键，由厂长、党委书记等各级领导干部深入生产第一线，通过种“试验田”和召开“三结合”专业会议，把群众创造的点滴经验，经过归纳，整理，总结出一套技术组织措施，在全厂普遍推广，保证了生铁消耗大幅度降低。这些经验的主要内容是：（一）化铁炉要保证供给转炉高温低硫铁水，为炼钢降低生铁消耗创造条件。为此，化铁炉职工学习了小高炉炼铁经验，对化铁炉进行改造，增添鼓风机，加大风量，做到配料准确，使配铁含硫量基本稳定，铁块、焦炭、熔剂保持块度均匀，不带杂质，保证透气性良好，炉况正常，实现了大风、高温、精料操作。成立加废油砖小组，专门负责往化铁炉内加废油砖，提高脱硫效果。此外，工人们在操作方法上也作了不少改进，减少了跑铁、漏风等事故，使化铁炉风眼明亮，风压保持在九十到一百一十度。由于采取以上措施，供给炼钢的铁水温度由一千三百五十度左右提高到一千三百七十度至一千四百度，化铁炉脱硫效率达到70％以上。
      （二）提高质量，不出废品，减少转炉操作中熔炼损失。为此，这个厂在铁水含硫量降低和稳定的情况下，推广了以王益元炼钢小组为主的一套先进操作法，从而使钢水温度和扒渣前期去硫效率提高，缩短了冶炼时间，减少了铁水喷溅损失。同时，炼钢工人推行炉前判定会、民主炼钢等方法，集思广益，减少废品和回炉事故。目前转炉每炉钢冶炼时间，一般已经由四十七分钟缩短到四十二分钟，做到合理吹损。由于钢锭质量提高，9月上、中旬就以同样数量的生铁比8月同期多炼出一千四百二十二吨钢。在转炉吹炼过程中，工人们操作认真仔细，注意节约点滴铁水，并经常维护好炉子，避免了跑钢、漏钢事故的发生。
    （三）提高钢锭浇注质量，减少浇余，消灭跑钢，冒钢事故。在这方面，着重总结推广了浇注工人常维民的歪包浇注等先进操作经验，根据钢水温度来控制浇注速度，采取连续细流填注，避免钢锭缩孔、皮下气泡事故的发生，又作到钢包不剩或少剩浇余钢水。许多浇注小组平均每吨钢的浇余钢水已经降低到零点零一公斤。
    （四）开源节流，大吃废钢。在炼钢过程中，总会产生一定数量的浇余钢水，化验的钢样、铁样，以及长度不合规格的小钢锭等，虽然数量不大，但是充分利用起来，再回炉冶炼，就能使生铁消耗降低到更低的限度。因此，职工们在设法提高钢水、铁水温度的前提下，创造出“四部吃废钢”的办法，即在化铁炉、转炉、铁水包、钢水包内，加入适量的废钢，不仅大大减少了生铁的耗用量，降低了成本，还增加了钢的产量。
                  抓紧小组工作实行评比奖励
    这个工厂在加强技术管理的同时，突出地加强了小组工作。他们发动工人参加计划、成本管理，实行小组经济核算，并建立群众性的评比节约奖励制度。小组班班评比，车间和全厂日日评比，把工人节约的成果及时公布出来，使降低生铁消耗成为群众的自觉行动，促进了增产节约竞赛的深入持久发展。从生产车间到辅助部门，从转炉到化铁炉，出现了人人关心成本，个个动手节约的新气象。谢清海炼钢小组工人，为在降低铁耗指标方面，超过全厂标兵王益元小组，每个人都有一本节约账；小组长谢清海和成本核算员李兆焰，几乎每天提前上班，了解车间其他小组的铁耗指标，学习别人的经验。这样，小组的铁耗指标直线下降，8月份夺得了全厂冠军。
