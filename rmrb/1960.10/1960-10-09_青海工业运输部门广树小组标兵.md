Xining, October 8th (from our newspaper) — Leading cadres at all levels in the coal, machinery, and highway transportation systems of Qinghai Province have gone deep into the front lines of production, widely establishing group pace-setters. They are mobilizing the masses to summarize and promote the production experience of these groups and launching a movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass advanced groups, thereby making the increase production and practice economy movement both vigorous and down-to-earth.

When focusing on grassroots work, the coal, machinery, and highway transportation systems, through in-depth investigation and research and close reliance on the masses, selected various types of group pace-setters. This allowed workers in workshops, at mine entrances, and in vehicle teams to have models to learn from, directions to catch up with, and targets to surpass, powerfully promoting the development of production. The pace-setters established by the coal system include: the He Jieyuan Group of the Datong Coal Mine, which has maintained safe production for ten years; the pace-setter established by the machinery department is: the Wang Jing Group of the casting workshop of the Xining Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Machinery Factory, which ensures quality and quantity; and the pace-setters established by the highway transportation department are: Liu Xinguo, a young heroic driver of the Qaidam Transportation Bureau who continuously sets new records, and the Feng Bin Group of the Fourth Team of the Qinghai Provincial Transportation Bureau, which has maintained safe driving for seven years. After the pace-setters were established, leaders at all levels immediately organized the broad masses of workers to carry out a competition movement of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping. During the competition, they regularly announced the plan completion status of participating groups and individuals, creating a heat wave of mutual pursuit among groups and individuals. Gu Jinjiang, a car driver of the Qaidam Transportation Bureau, after seeing the young driver Liu Xinguo create a new driving record, immediately expressed his intention to learn from and catch up with Liu Xinguo. Because of his hard work, he continuously achieved over 10,000 ton-kilometers per ton-month for seven consecutive months, and created a record of 50,000 ton-kilometers per ton-month. In August, this bureau had a total of 116 "Liu Xinguo-style" advanced producers who were safe, high-yielding, and fuel-efficient. After the workers of the Datong Mining Bureau learned from and caught up with the He Jieyuan Group, the bureau overfulfilled its raw coal production plan from early August to early September.

In grasping group work firmly, leaders at all levels are assigned to go deep into the grassroots, participating in labor while helping the groups summarize and improve their management and technical levels, and promptly promote these improvements, turning the experience of one group into the collective wealth immediately. Bai Xianmin, Director of the Qinghai Provincial Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Machinery Bureau, went deep into the Xining Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Machinery Factory and found that the castings from the casting workshop could not keep up with the processing needs, affecting the production of subsequent processes. However, the Wang Jing Group (Third Group) of this workshop consistently completed its plan, while the Fourth Group, with the same conditions, had the worst completion rate. Bai Xianmin, along with the factory party secretary and the workshop director, seized these "two ends" to summarize and promptly disseminated the advanced experience of the Third Group in making innovations and improvements in sand mixing, modeling, and iron melting, immediately changing the production outlook of the entire workshop. The leaders at all levels of the Qinghai Provincial Highway Transportation System also conscientiously helped the Feng Bin Group of the Fourth Automobile Team summarize the driving experience of "three diligences and four slowness" (three diligences are diligent inspection, diligent maintenance, and diligent repair; four slowness are slow turning and downhill, slow overtaking and meeting, slow in urban and rural areas, slow over bridges and ferries) and the management experience of clear division of labor and sound system; the coal system summarized and promoted the experience of the He Jieyuan Group in conscientiously implementing coal mining experiences from all over the country in conjunction with the specific conditions of their unit. In this way, the safe driving and coal mining experience of one group was immediately promoted throughout the province.

    青海工业运输部门广树小组标兵
    本报西宁8日电　青海省煤炭、机械、公路运输三个系统的各级领导干部深入生产第一线，广树小组标兵，发动群众总结推广小组生产工作经验，开展学赶超先进小组运动，使增产节约运动开展得既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实。
    煤炭、机械、公路运输三个系统在抓基层工作时，经过深入调查研究和紧密依靠群众，评选出了各种类型的小组标兵，使车间、井口、车队的职工都学有榜样、赶有方向、超有目标，有力地促进了生产的发展。煤炭系统树立的标兵是：大通煤矿十年来安全生产的贺杰元小组；机械部门树立的标兵是：西宁农牧机械厂铸工车间保质保量的王静小组；公路交通部门树立的标兵是：柴达木交通局连续创造新纪录的青年英雄司机刘新国和青海省交通厅运输局汽车四队七年如一日安全行车的冯斌小组。标兵树立起来以后，各级领导立即组织广大职工开展学、比、赶、帮的竞赛运动。竞赛中，随时公布参加竞赛的小组、个人完成计划的情况，使组与组、个人与个人之间形成了你追我赶的热潮。柴达木交通局汽车司机顾锦江看到青年司机刘新国创造行车新纪录后，立即表示要学、赶刘新国。由于他埋头苦干，连续七个月使车吨月产达到万吨公里以上，并创造了车吨月产五万吨公里的纪录。8月份，这个局共涌现出安全、高产、节油的“刘新国式”先进生产者一百一十六名。大通矿务局职工学赶贺杰元小组以后，全局8月初到9月上旬的原煤生产计划都超额完成了。
    在狠抓小组工作中，各级领导都分工深入基层，一边参加劳动，一边帮助小组总结、提高管理水平和技术水平，并及时加以推广，使一个小组的经验立即变成集体的财富。青海省农牧机械局局长白先民，深入西宁农牧机械厂，发现铸工车间的铸件总跟不上加工的需要，影响下列各个工序的生产。但这个车间的王静小组（第三组）却班班完成了计划，而条件相同的第四组完成计划却最差。白先民就和厂党委书记、车间主任抓住这个“两头”，进行总结，及时传播了第三组在大闹革新、改进拌砂、造型、化铁等方面的先进经验，使全车间的生产面貌立即改观。青海省公路运输系统的各级领导还认真帮助汽车四队冯斌小组总结了“三勤四慢”的行车经验（三勤是勤检查、勤保养、勤修理，四慢是转弯下坡慢、超车会车慢、市区村镇慢、过桥过渡慢）和小组分工明确、制度健全的管理经验；煤炭系统总结推广了贺杰元小组结合本单位的具体情况认真推行全国各地采煤经验的经验。这样，就使一个组的安全行车、采煤经验立即在全省推广。
