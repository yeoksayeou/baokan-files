    Warmly Celebrate the Signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty

    The Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty of great historical significance was formally signed in Beijing yesterday, on our National Day, by Premier Zhou Enlai of our country and Prime Minister U Nu of Burma. From then on, a boundary line of peace and friendship between China and Burma was declared to be born. The signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty is undoubtedly a major political event between China and Burma. It not only lays a solid foundation for the further development of friendly relations between China and Burma, but will also have a profound impact on the relations between Asian countries. While warmly celebrating their National Day, the Chinese people, with unparalleled excitement, celebrate the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty with the Burmese people, celebrate the birth of the Sino-Burmese peaceful and friendly boundary line, and celebrate the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples as they climb from one peak to another.

    The Sino-Burmese boundary issue is an extremely complex issue left over by imperialist aggression that has been unresolved for a long time. Now all the complex issues have been resolved fairly and reasonably based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. The Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty reasonably demarcates the undefined section of the boundary from Gao Mountain to the western end of the Sino-Burmese boundary. This section of the boundary, except for the areas of Pianma, Gulang, and Kangfang, is entirely delimited according to the traditional customary line. This is the only fair and reasonable solution for both China and Burma, ensuring that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both sides are respected. In this treaty, the Burmese side agreed to return the areas of Pianma, Gulang, and Kangfang, which were gradually occupied by British troops from 1905 to 1911 and belonged to China, thus solving the complex issue of the northern section of the Sino-Burmese boundary line. The Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty also reasonably resolved the complex issue of the Meng-Mao Triangle. According to the 1897 Sino-British Boundary Treaty, this area was designated as a "perpetual lease" area of British Burma, which is not in line with the current equal and friendly relations between China and Burma. The two sides decided to abolish Burma's "perpetual lease" relationship over the Meng-Mao Triangle belonging to China. In the same spirit of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual concession, and taking into account the actual needs of the Burmese side, the Chinese side agreed to transfer this area to Burma, making it part of the territory of the Union of Burma. In exchange, and in order to take care of historical relations and the integrity of the tribes, the Burmese side agreed to delineate the area west of the 1941 line under the jurisdiction of the Pan-Hong and Pan-Lao tribes, which belonged to Burma according to the 1941 exchange of notes between the Chinese and British governments, to China, thereby eliminating the unreasonable situation in which these two tribes were artificially divided into two parts, China and Burma, by the 1941 line. In addition, in the treaty, the Chinese government also formally abandoned the right of China to participate in the operation of the Burmese Lufang mining enterprises, as stipulated in the 1941 exchange of notes between the Chinese and British governments, based on its consistent policy of opposing foreign privileges and respecting the sovereignty of other countries. Other issues have also been resolved fairly and reasonably in the treaty.

    It is not difficult to see that the Sino-Burmese boundary issue has been resolved satisfactorily because: First, both China and Burma recognize that the Sino-Burmese boundary issue is a complex issue left over by history and should consider the historical background and the current actual situation, adopt an attitude of mutual understanding and mutual concession based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and resolve it comprehensively through friendly consultations. Before a comprehensive solution to the boundary issue was reached, both China and Burma firmly maintained the long-existing status quo of the boundary and did not take unilateral actions to change this status quo. This provided a good premise for a comprehensive solution to the Sino-Burmese boundary issue. Second, through repeated friendly consultations, China and Burma have made it possible for their views to gradually converge and become consistent. Despite the fact that during the negotiation process, due to the various complex factors of history, geography, ethnicity, and economy, the two sides have had some temporary differences, our two countries' common desire to peacefully resolve the boundary issue has not been shaken. On the contrary, both China and Burma have made more active efforts to seek a solution. Third, the Sino-Burmese talks on the boundary issue fully reflected the spirit of equality, mutual benefit, mutual understanding, and mutual concession. The demarcation of the undefined boundary in the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, the handling of disputes caused by imperialist aggression in history, and the necessary and appropriate adjustments to certain locations and villages on the boundary are all the result of mutual understanding and mutual concession between China and Burma under the strict observance of the principles of equality and mutual benefit.

    Obviously, the comprehensive and reasonable solution of the Sino-Burmese boundary issue is a great victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China and Burma. It powerfully proves that between Asian countries, between countries with different social systems, as long as they adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, any complex issues left over by history can be resolved reasonably through friendly consultations. Due to the long-term aggression of imperialism, there are historical boundary issues between our country and some neighboring countries in South Asia. After these Asian countries successively gained independence, we had the conditions to solve these boundary issues on a new basis, whether these issues arose because the relevant boundaries were historically undefined or unmarked, or because the relevant boundaries were imposed on one party by imperialism. The key to the problem lies in whether both parties to the relevant boundary have the sincerity to abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, adopt an attitude of mutual understanding and mutual concession on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and resolve the problem through friendly consultations. As long as both parties have such sincerity, boundary issues and other disputes are not difficult to resolve.

    For more than a year, imperialism, especially US imperialism and its followers, have unscrupulously used the boundary issue to carry out shameless slander and vilification against the Chinese people, viciously attacking China as "belligerent" and "unwilling to coexist peacefully," and so on. However, the facts have dealt a fatal blow to US imperialism and its followers. Our government has not only taken the lead in advocating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but has also practiced them and adhered to a peaceful foreign policy. China has successively signed treaties of friendship and non-aggression or treaties of peace and friendship with Yemen, Burma, Nepal, Afghanistan, and Guinea. The Chinese government has also repeatedly proposed that Asian and Pacific countries, including the United States, conclude a non-aggression peace pact and establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Now, the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty once again eloquently proves that the Chinese government spares no effort to adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and pursues a policy of good-neighborliness with neighboring countries. On the contrary, is it not US imperialism that is wantonly invading its neighboring country Cuba? Is it not US imperialism that is even occupying China's territory of Taiwan in the Asian region thousands of miles away, establishing missile bases, and frantically preparing for a nuclear war? Is it not US imperialism that is currently gathering warships in the South China Sea and directing the Thai reactionaries to interfere in the internal affairs of Laos? It is very clear that it is not others, but US imperialism, which slanders China as "belligerent" and "unwilling to coexist peacefully," that truly adheres to a policy of war and aggression and opposes peaceful coexistence.

    US imperialism and its followers cannot stand the development of friendship between the peoples of China and Burma, and between the peoples of China and Asian and African countries. However, this cannot be blamed on the Chinese people and the peoples of Asian and African countries. The development of unity and friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of Asian and African countries is by no means subject to the subjective will of US imperialism. Contrary to the wishes of US imperialism and its followers, the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty has brought Sino-Burmese friendly relations into a new historical stage, making a positive and significant contribution to expanding the peace zone in Asia, strengthening unity among Asian countries, and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

    China and Burma are close neighbors. The people of China and Burma, especially between the border residents, are not only neighbors, but also have a "pauk-phaw" relationship as close as family. The aggression and discord of imperialism and colonialism have failed to hinder the friendship between the two peoples. This shows that the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma can stand the test of time. From now on, we firmly believe that the emergence of a peaceful and friendly boundary will open up a wider world for the friendly relations, economic and cultural exchanges between China and Burma.

    Today, on the solemn day when the peoples of China and Burma warmly celebrate the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to all previous Burmese governments and Burmese friends who have contributed to creating a peaceful and friendly boundary between China and Burma for the benefit of future generations. Prime Minister U Nu has been concerned about the friendly resolution of the boundary issue between the two countries from beginning to end. The Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression and the Agreement on Boundary Issues signed by General Ne Win on behalf of the Burmese government in January this year paved the way for a rapid and smooth resolution of the boundary issue. Let us thank the friendly cooperation of the Burmese delegation to the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee, headed by Brigadier General Aung Gyi, and the significant efforts they have made. Let us also thank the thousands of Chinese and Burmese surveyors, cartographers, and logistics personnel who have worked diligently under the specific guidance of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee to create a peaceful and friendly boundary between China and Burma and have successfully completed the survey task. Braving wind and rain, undaunted by the dangers of high mountains and steep ridges, and overcoming numerous difficulties, they completed the important task entrusted to them by the peoples of China and Burma and presented a specific and accurate peaceful and friendly boundary to the peoples of China and Burma in just three months. We would also like to especially thank the Burmese Armed Forces for their active support for the survey work. They cooperated with our border troops to smash the sabotage activities of the remnant bandits of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang who fled to Burma. All those who have contributed to the birth of the Sino-Burmese peaceful and friendly boundary, your meritorious achievements in this regard will be passed down from generation to generation by the peoples of China and Burma and all peace-loving people in the world.

    Today, on the joyful and inspiring day when the peoples of China and Burma warmly celebrate the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, let us shout together: Long live the peaceful and friendly boundary between China and Burma! Hail the completion of the building of Sino-Burmese friendship! Long live the growing brotherly friendship between the peoples of China and Burma!

### 热烈庆祝中缅边界条约的签订

    热烈庆祝中缅边界条约的签订
    具有重大历史意义的中缅边界条约，昨天在我国的国庆佳节，由我国周恩来总理和缅甸吴努总理在北京正式签字了。从此，中缅之间一条和平友好的边界线宣告诞生了。中缅边界条约的签订，无疑地是中缅之间的重大政治事件，它不仅为中缅两国友好关系的进一步发展，奠定了巩固的基础，而且必将对亚洲各国之间的关系发生极为深远的影响。中国人民在热烈地欢度自己国庆节日的同时，以无比兴奋的心情，同缅甸人民一道，庆祝中缅边界条约的签订，庆祝中缅和平友好边界线的诞生，庆祝中缅两国人民的友谊，从一个高峰攀登上另一个高峰。
    中缅边界问题，是帝国主义侵略所造成的、长期悬而未决的极为复杂的问题。现在所有的复杂问题都一一根据平等互利的原则，得到了公平合理的解决。中缅边界条约合理地划定了从尖高山到中缅边界西端终点的这一段未定界。这一段边界除了片马、古浪和岗房地区以外，完全按照传统的习惯线定界。这是对于中缅双方来说，唯一公平合理的解决办法，使双方的主权和领土完整都得到了尊重。在这个条约中，缅甸方面同意把1905年到1911年期间为英国军队所逐步侵占的、属于中国的片马、古浪、岗房地区归还给中国，这就使中缅北段边界线的复杂问题迎刃而解。中缅边界条约也合理地解决了猛卯三角地的复杂问题。这一地区根据1897年中英划界条约，曾经被规定为英属缅甸的“永租”地区，这种“永租”不符合于目前中缅两国之间的平等友好的关系。双方决定废除缅甸对属于中国的猛卯三角地所保持的“永租”关系。中国方面同样根据平等互利和互让的精神，并且考虑到缅甸方面的实际需要，同意把这一地区移交给缅甸，成为缅甸联邦领土的一部分。作为交换，同时为了照顾历史关系和部落的完整，缅甸方面同意把按照1941年中英两国政府换文规定属于缅甸的班洪、班老部落在1941年线以西的辖区划归中国，从而消除了这两个部落被1941年线所人为地分割为中缅两部分的不合理状态。此外，在条约中，中国政府还根据一贯反对外国特权和尊重其他国家主权的政策，正式放弃1941年中英两国政府换文规定的、中国参加经营缅甸炉房矿产企业的权利。其他问题，也都在条约中得到了公平合理的解决。
    人们不难看到，中缅边界问题之所以能够得到圆满的解决，是由于：首先，中缅双方都承认，中缅边界问题是历史遗留下来的复杂问题，应该考虑历史背景和当前的实际情况，根据和平共处的五项原则，采取互谅互让的态度，通过友好协商，加以全面解决。在边界问题取得全面解决以前，中缅双方都曾坚决地维持边界久已存在的状况，而不以片面行动来改变这种状况。这样，就为全面解决中缅边界问题提供了良好的前提。其次，中缅双方通过反复的友好协商，使双方的观点有可能逐步地接近和一致起来。尽管在谈判过程中，由于历史的、地理的、民族的和经济的种种复杂因素，双方也曾有过某些暂时的分歧，但是我们两国和平解决边界问题的共同愿望并没有因此而有所动摇。相反地，中缅双方都作出了更积极的努力，谋求解决。第三，中缅关于边界问题的会谈充分地体现了平等互利和互谅互让的精神。中缅边界条约中对于未定界的划定，对于历史上由于帝国主义侵略所造成的争议问题的处理，以及对于边界上某些地点和村寨的必要的适当的调整，都是中缅双方在严格地遵循平等互利的原则之下进行了互谅互让的结果。
    很显然，中缅边界问题全面合理的解决，是中缅两国共同倡导的和平共处五项原则的伟大胜利。它有力地证明了亚洲国家之间，不同社会制度国家之间，只要信守和平共处五项原则，历史上遗留下来的任何复杂问题都是可以通过友好协商的途径，求得合理的解决的。由于帝国主义的长期侵略，我国同南亚的某些邻国之间存在着历史上遗留下来的边界问题。在我们这些亚洲国家相继获得独立之后，我们就有了在新的基础上解决这些边界问题的条件，不论这些问题是由于有关边界在历史上未经划定或标定而产生的，或是由于有关边界是帝国主义强加于一方而产生的。问题的关键在于有关边界的双方是否都具有信守和平共处五项原则、在平等互利的基础上采取互谅互让的态度和通过友好协商解决问题的诚意。只要双方具有这样的诚意，边界问题和其它争端，都是不难解决的。
    一年多以来，帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义及其追随者们曾大肆利用边界问题对中国人民进行无耻的诽谤和诬蔑，恶毒地攻击中国“好战”和“不要和平共处”等等。但是，事实给了美帝国主义及其追随者以致命的打击。我国政府不仅首先倡导了和平共处的五项原则，而且身体力行，坚持奉行和平外交政策。中国先后同也门、缅甸、尼泊尔、阿富汗和几内亚签订了友好和互不侵犯条约或和平友好条约。中国政府还一再建议亚洲和太平洋各国包括美国在内缔结一项互不侵犯的和平公约，建立无核武器的地区。现在，中缅边界条约的签订，又一次雄辩地证明了，中国政府不遗余力地坚持着和平共处的五项原则，奉行着同邻国之间和睦相处的政策。恰恰相反，美帝国主义难道不是正在蛮横地侵略着它的邻近国家古巴吗？美帝国主义难道不是甚至在万里之外的亚洲地区侵占中国的领土台湾，建立导弹基地，疯狂地准备着核子战争吗？目前美帝国主义难道不是正在南中国海集结军舰，并且指使泰国反动派干涉着老挝的内政吗？十分清楚，不是别人，正是诬蔑中国“好战”和“不要和平共处”的美帝国主义，才真正坚持战争政策和侵略政策，反对和平共处。
    对于中缅两国人民、中国和亚非各国人民之间的友谊的发展，美帝国主义及其追随者是看不顺眼的。但是，这怪不得中国人民和亚非各国人民。中国人民和亚非各国人民之间的团结和友谊的发展，是绝不以美帝国主义的主观意志为转移的。与美帝国主义及其追随者的愿望相反，中缅边界条约的签订，使中缅友好关系进入了一个新的历史阶段，对于扩大亚洲的和平地区，加强亚洲各国之间的团结，维护亚洲和世界和平事业，作出了积极的、重大的贡献。
    中国和缅甸是紧密的邻邦，中缅两国人民，尤其在边民之间，不仅是邻居的关系，而且还有着亲如一家的“胞波”关系。帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略和挑拨离间，都没有能够阻挠两国人民的友好。这就说明，中缅两国人民的友谊是经得起时间的考验的。而今后，我们深信，一条和平友好的边界的出现，将为中缅两国之间的友好关系、经济和文化各方面的密切往来开辟更为广阔的天地。
    今天，在中缅两国人民热情庆祝中缅边界条约签订的庄严的日子里，我们要向一切为中缅两国人民的子孙万代创造中缅和平友好边界作出过贡献的缅甸历届政府和缅甸朋友们表示诚挚的感谢。吴努总理自始至终关怀着两国边界问题的友好解决。奈温将军今年1月代表缅甸政府同我国签订的中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和关于边界问题的协定，则为边界问题迅速而顺利地获得解决铺平了道路。让我们感谢以昂季准将为首的中缅边界联合委员会缅方代表团的友好合作和他们所作的重大努力。也让我们感谢在中缅边界联合委员会的具体指导下，为创造中缅和平友好边界而辛勤工作，并胜利完成了勘察任务的几千名中缅双方的勘察人员、测绘人员、后勤人员，他们冒着风雨，不畏重山峻岭的艰险，克服重重困难，完成了中缅两国人民的重托，仅仅在三个月的时间内，就把一条和平友好的边界具体而准确地呈献在中缅两国人民的面前了。我们也要特别感谢缅甸联邦国防军对勘察工作的积极支持，他们配合我国边防军粉碎了逃缅蒋匪残余匪帮的破坏活动。所有为中缅和平友好边界的诞生而作出过贡献的人们，你们在这方面所建树的功勋，将世世代代为中缅两国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民所传颂。
    今天，在中缅两国人民热情庆祝中缅边界条约签订的欢欣鼓舞的日子里，让我们一起高呼：中缅之间的和平友好的边界万岁！欢呼中缅友好大厦的落成！中缅两国人民日益增长的亲戚般的友谊万岁！
