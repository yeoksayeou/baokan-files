Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 28th - Leaders of various Cuban revolutionary organizations today called on revolutionary youth to strengthen unity to defend the revolution.

    The "Appeal to Cuban Youth" signed by these leaders stated, "The unity of all youth forces in our country who support the current revolutionary process is essential for defending and advancing our revolution."

    The appeal stated, "The organized unity of Cuban youth and all revolutionary strata is the best guarantee for achieving victory on the road to defending our country's sovereignty, independence, and revolution; especially when U.S. imperialism is fanatically preparing to attack our homeland." The appeal pointed out, "Doing so will enable us to unite all forces to accomplish the task of realizing the program of the second stage of our revolution. This program is based on the Havana Declaration."

    The appeal called on Cuban youth to unite more firmly around the revolutionary government and the leaders headed by Prime Minister Castro today than ever before, and called out: "Unite to defend the motherland threatened by U.S. imperialists, war criminals, and hired traitors. Unite to build the motherland more happily and beautifully. Unite to develop the economy, promote industrialization, and produce more and better. This is the voice in the hearts of all young people in our country today. Unite to strive for all the rights proclaimed in the Havana Declaration."

    Revolutionary leaders called on the youth to "Study, work, and advance with weapons in hand!" "Eliminate poverty, unemployment, and the phenomenon of human exploitation from our land!"

    The leaders of the following organizations signed this appeal: "July 26th Movement," Revolutionary Guidance Committee, People's Socialist Party, Cuban Workers' Confederation, Socialist Youth League, Rebel Army Youth Federation, and Havana University Students' Federation.

    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 28th - Blas Roca, General Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, emphasized in a television program last night that U.S. imperialism is becoming increasingly frantic in the face of the progress of the Cuban revolution, and they are determined to suppress the Cuban revolution.

    Roca pointed out that the Cuban people and government have taken increasingly strong measures against every threat and aggression by U.S. imperialism. They have not retreated, but have advanced the revolution. Cuba has not only defended itself against attacks but has also recovered its wealth. Through some recently enacted laws, Cuba has become the true master of its own economy. Roca said that there is no difference between the two presidential candidates of the U.S. Republican and Democratic parties. Both of these people represent the imperialist forces that exploit the American people and oppress the peoples of Latin America and the world. However, no matter who is elected, if they come here, the Cuban people will firmly answer them. Roca said that the movement to support Cuba is so great that if anyone dares to attack Cuba, serious reactions will occur in various Latin American countries.

    Roca called on all patriotic forces in Cuba to devote themselves to the revolution. He said that the aggression of U.S. imperialism will not only be to restore their privileges, but also means a cruel and bloody revenge against all the Cuban people.

    Roca finally called on Cuban youth to strengthen unity, increase production, and learn to master weapons in order to defend the motherland.

    古巴各革命组织领导人号召全国青年
    团结起来保卫革命反对美国侵略
    罗加说古巴人民不怕美国威胁坚决推进革命
    新华社哈瓦那28日电　古巴各革命组织的领导人今天号召革命青年加强团结保卫革命。
    由这些领导人签署的“致古巴青年号召书”说，“我国拥护目前革命进程的一切青年力量的统一，是保卫和推进我国革命必不可少的。”
    号召书说，“古巴青年和一切革命阶层的有组织的团结是在保卫我国主权、独立和革命的道路上取得胜利的最好保证；特别是在美帝国主义狂热地准备进攻我们祖国的时候。”号召书指出，“这样做就能使我们联合一切力量来完成这样的任务，即实现我们革命第二阶段的纲领。这个纲领便是哈瓦那宣言的基础。”
    号召书要求古巴青年今天要比以往更加坚定地团结在革命政府以及以卡斯特罗总理为首的领导人的周围，号召书呼吁说：“团结起来保卫遭受美帝国主义者、战争罪犯和被雇佣的叛徒威胁的祖国。团结起来把祖国建设得更幸福和更加美丽。团结起来发展经济，促进工业化和生产得更多、更好。这是今天我国所有青年心中的呼声。团结起来争取哈瓦那宣言所宣布的全部权利。”
    革命领导人号召青年“学习、工作和手执武器前进！”“在我国土地上消灭贫困、失业和人剥削人的现象！”
    签署这项号召书的有：“7月26日运动”、革命指导委员会、人民社会党、古巴工人联合会、社会主义青年联盟、起义军青年联合会和哈瓦那大学生联合会等组织的领导人。
    新华社哈瓦那28日电　古巴人民社会党总书记布拉斯·罗加昨晚在电视节目中强调说，美帝国主义面对古巴革命的进展而表现日益疯狂，它们决心镇压古巴革命。
    罗加指出古巴人民和政府针对美帝国主义的每一个威胁和每一次侵略采取了日益有力的措施。他们没有后退，而是向前推进了革命。古巴不仅进行了反对攻击的自卫，而且收回了自己的财富。通过最近颁布的一些法律，古巴已经成为自己经济的真正主人。罗加说，美国共和党和民主党的两个总统候选人之间没有什么区别。这两个人都是代表剥削美国人民和压迫拉丁美洲以及全世界各国人民的帝国主义力量。但是，不管是谁当选，如果他们来到这里，古巴人民都将坚定地回答他们。罗加说，支援古巴的运动是如此巨大，以致如果有人胆敢进攻古巴，在拉丁美洲各国将会发生严重的反响。
    罗加号召古巴一切爱国力量投入革命。他说，美帝国主义的侵略将不仅是为了恢复他们的特权，而且意味着对全体古巴人民的残酷和血腥的报复。
    罗加最后号召古巴青年加强团结，提高生产，学会掌握武器，以便捍卫祖国。
