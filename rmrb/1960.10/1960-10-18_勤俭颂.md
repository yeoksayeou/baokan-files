    Ode to Diligence and Thrift
    Yang Benchu, of a certain PLA unit

    Under the direct education and cultivation of the Party, the people's soldiers deeply understand the value of every snip of the scissors and every thread. The people's soldiers value every lampshade, every piece of wood, every iron nail, every stone, every grain of sand, and even a single grain of cement is not allowed to be blown away by the wind. At every construction site, a waste collection station is set up: a piece of rope, a piece of broken glass are all objects for the waste collection station.

    When the gas lamp mantle is broken and turned to ashes, the soldiers still keep it. If the second mantle is broken again, the soldiers will use toothpaste as a patching material, and use the first broken mantle to repair the second broken mantle. The second broken mantle can continue to be used, and its brightness is the same as a new one.

    When the sun is about to rise, the soldiers go to extinguish the gas lamps, carry out the glass mirrors, and continue working using the reflection of the glass mirrors.

    The thread removed from the cement bag mouths is used by the soldiers to mend clothes and sew quilts. However, cement is used in quantities of thousands and tens of thousands of tons, so the amount of thread removed is also large. How can it all be used for mending clothes and sewing quilts? In the hands of the soldiers, it is transformed into various forms of mesh bags. Some are used by themselves, and more are given to elementary school students, the old landlord lady, or the commune.

    When it comes to the use of wood, who would have thought that there is so much to be done in this area. In the early stage of construction, a set of formwork could be written off after being used two or three times. In the years of the Great Leap Forward, a set of formwork can still be used after ten times. The soldiers also have a complete set of methods for using wood. When wood is made into formwork, no nails are used at the beginning. When it gets old, strips of wood are added, and supports are added so it can continue to be used. When large materials become small materials, the soldiers come up with a way to combine the small materials and they become large materials again. Encouraged by the Great Leap Forward, the soldiers came up with another way, and so-called waste products were put to use again. The spirit of careful calculation for the revolutionary cause is our glorious tradition, and we must continue to carry it forward!

    勤俭颂
    解放军某部　杨本初
    人民子弟兵，在党的直接教育和培养下，深深懂得每一剪刀，每一线条的价值。人民子弟兵对每一个灯罩，一块木板，一根铁钉，一颗石子，一粒沙，甚至于连水泥也不让风吹走一粒。每一个工地上，都设置了一个废品收集站：一段绳索，一块破玻璃，都是废品收集站的对象。
    汽灯用的纱罩坏了，已成灰烬，战士仍把它留下，如果第二个纱罩又坏了，战士就会用牙膏来做贴料，用第一个破纱罩来修补第二个破纱罩，第二个破纱罩又可以继续使用，它发光的亮度和新的一样。
    太阳将出的时候，战士就去熄灭汽灯，抬出玻璃镜，利用玻璃镜的反光，继续工作着。
    水泥袋口上拆下的线，战士用它补衣缝被。然而，水泥是成千成万吨的使用，所以，拆下的线也就多起来了，补衣缝被又怎能用了呢？在战士的手里，又变成了各种形式的线网袋。一部分自己用，更多的送给小学生，房东老大娘或者公社。
    在使用木材上，谁能想到，这方面也大有文章可做。施工初期，一套模板，使用二三次就可以报销，在大跃进的年代里，一套模板用十次以后仍然可以继续用。战士对木材使用也有一整套办法。木材制成模板，开始使用时不用钉子，旧了加上板条，加上支撑又可继续用。大材料变成小材料了，战士又想出办法来，把小材料合起来，又成了大材料。在大跃进的鼓舞下，战士又想出了办法，所谓废品又用上了。为革命事业精打细算的精神，是我们光荣的传统，我们必须继续发扬光大！
