Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, 9th. Guinean Radio today, in a commentary entitled "Abbas in Beijing," pointed out the great significance of China's support for the Algerian people's struggle. The commentary said that there is no doubt that the People's Republic of China has formally expressed its attitude, which is of paramount importance to the outcome of the struggle in Algeria. The warm welcome given by the Chinese people to the delegation led by Abbas, and the joint communique issued earlier during the stay in the People's Republic of China of the first delegation of the Provisional Government of Algeria, headed by Algerian Deputy Prime Minister Belkacem, have had a huge impact around the world. As Abbas said in his speech in Beijing, this is the most precious encouragement to us and the strongest support for the Algerian people who share weal and woe with the Chinese people.

The commentary strongly condemned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, led by the United States, for helping France wage a colonial war in Algeria. It said: If it were not for the collusion between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, especially the United States, and France, which gave the French imperialists significant assistance, the combined forces of the Algerian people and the peace-loving and freedom-loving people of all countries would have completely thwarted France's arrogant conspiracy in Algeria long ago.

The commentary pointed out that the war of aggression launched by France against Algeria seven years ago is not only continuing but has also developed to the scale of genocide. France's NATO allies have always been accomplices in this heinous crime.

The commentary said that Algerian Provisional Government Premier Abbas, in his speech during his visit to Beijing, strongly condemned NATO for helping to wage this colonial war.

The commentary also quoted Premier Abbas as saying: If the French war machine did not have the support of the entire North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and mainly the United States, in terms of weapons, finance and equipment, it would never have been able to do this.

    几内亚电台评阿巴斯总理访问中国
    中国支持阿尔及利亚具有重大意义
    谴责美国和北大西洋集团支持法国进行殖民战争
    新华社科纳克里9日电　几内亚电台今天在以“阿巴斯在北京”为题的评论中，指出中国对阿尔及利亚人民斗争的支持的重大意义。评论说，无容置疑的是，中华人民共和国已经正式表示的态度，对在阿尔及利亚进行的斗争的结果，是举足轻重的。中国人民最近对阿巴斯所率领的代表团的热烈欢迎，以及早些时候以阿尔及利亚共和国副总理贝勒卡塞姆为首的阿尔及利亚临时政府的第一个代表团在中华人民共和国逗留期间发表的联合公报，都在全世界产生巨大的影响。正如阿巴斯在北京发表的演说中所说的，这是对我们的最可珍贵的鼓舞，是对同中国人民休戚相关的阿尔及利亚人民的最为坚强的声援。
    评论强烈谴责以美国为首的北大西洋公约组织国家帮助法国在阿尔及利亚进行的殖民战争。它说：要不是由于北大西洋公约组织，首先是美国同法国的狼狈为奸，给予法帝国主义者以重大的援助，阿尔及利亚人民同爱好和平和自由的各国人民的联合力量，早就会完全挫败法国在阿尔及利亚的狂妄阴谋。
    评论指出：法国在七年前向阿尔及利亚发动的侵略战争现在不仅在继续进行，而且发展到了种族灭绝的规模。法国的北大西洋公约组织的各盟国则始终在充当这一可恶罪行的帮凶。
    评论说，阿尔及利亚临时政府总理阿巴斯在访问北京时发表的演说中，强烈谴责了北大西洋公约组织帮助进行这场殖民战争。
    评论还引述阿巴斯总理的话说：假如法国的战争机器没有整个北大西洋公约组织，以及主要是美国的武器、财政和装备方面的支援，它本来是决不能做到这种地步的。
