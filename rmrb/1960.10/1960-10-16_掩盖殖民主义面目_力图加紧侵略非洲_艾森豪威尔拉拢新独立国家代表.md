Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th: U.S. President Eisenhower specially dispatched an airplane on the 14th to bring the heads of the delegations from fifteen newly admitted African nations and Cyprus, attending the 15th UN General Assembly from New York to Washington, to meet with him.

During his meeting with them, Eisenhower tried his best to conceal America's colonialist stance, especially the hideous face exposed by the United States' attempt to swallow the Congo through the United Nations. He hypocritically told the representatives of these countries that "the United States does not want to militarily, politically or economically dominate, control or overthrow the people of your countries." At the same time, he harped on the "Cold War" tune, slandering the Soviet Union as a "belligerent dictatorship" that wants to "control the world from Moscow." He wanted these newly independent countries to become America's "willing partners" to join the United States in so-called "preventing selfish and dictatorial forces from prevailing in the world."

Eisenhower also stated that the United States would continue to use the aggressive tool of "economic aid" to further infiltrate these newly independent countries. He once again peddled the U.S.'s aggressive plan proposed at the United Nations, aimed at controlling Africa, expressing the hope that the newly independent African countries would accept this plan.

It is reported that after the representatives of these sixteen newly independent countries returned to New York, U.S. Under Secretary of State Dillon and Treasury Secretary Anderson held further talks with them.

The U.S. State Department announced on the same day that Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson would visit eighteen African countries on the 17th. The United States will also establish embassies in Dahomey, Niger, Upper Volta, Chad, the Central African Republic, and Gabon in the "near future."

    掩盖殖民主义面目　力图加紧侵略非洲 
    艾森豪威尔拉拢新独立国家代表
    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔14日特地派飞机把新加入联合国的十五个非洲国家和塞浦路斯出席十五届联大的代表团团长从纽约接到华盛顿，同他会面。
    艾森豪威尔在同他们会见时，竭力掩盖美国的殖民主义立场，特别是掩盖美国利用联合国鲸吞刚果而暴露出来的狰狞面目。他假惺惺地对这些国家的代表们说，“美国并不想在军事上、政治上或经济上统治、控制或打倒你们国家的人民”。同时，他又大弹“冷战”滥调，诬蔑苏联是“好战的独裁政体”，要“从莫斯科控制世界”。他要这些新独立的国家成为美国的
  “心甘情愿的伙伴”，同美国一起去所谓“防止自私的和独裁的势力在世界上得逞”。
    艾森豪威尔还表示，美国要继续利用“经济援助”这个侵略工具来进一步渗入这些新独立国家。他再次兜售美国在联合国提出的目的在于控制非洲的侵略计划，表示希望非洲的新独立国家能够接受这个计划。
    据报道，在这十六个新独立国家的代表返回纽约后，美国副国务卿狄龙和财政部长安德逊还同他们作了进一步的晤谈。
    美国国务院在同一天宣布，副国务卿帮办汉德逊将在17日前往非洲十八个国家访问。美国还将在“最近的将来”在达荷美、尼日尔、上沃尔特、乍得、中非共和国和加蓬设立大使馆。
