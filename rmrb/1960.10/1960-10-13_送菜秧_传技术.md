    Delivering Vegetable Seedlings and Passing on Techniques
    The Guhe Brigade and the Shengli Brigade of our commune are competitors in large-scale autumn vegetable planting. The Guhe Brigade has experience in vegetable growing, and the quantity and quality of its autumn vegetable planting have surpassed those of the Shengli Brigade. In vegetable field management, the Guhe Brigade promoted the communist spirit and actively supported the Shengli Brigade, enabling the Shengli Brigade to catch up with itself.
    The Shengli Brigade lacked vegetable seedlings, making replanting and transplanting very difficult. Li Hengcai, the captain of the Guhe Brigade, led six brigade members, including vegetable growing expert Feng Anzong, to carry more than 670 catties of vegetable seedlings to the Shengli Brigade. While helping with the rush planting, they also imparted their techniques. In four days, the Shengli Brigade increased its vegetable planting area from 260 mu to 520 mu. Many commune members also learned the vegetable management experience of the Guhe Brigade, achieving frequent topdressing, weeding, and watering.
    Now the autumn vegetables in both brigades are growing very well.

    送菜秧  传技术
    我们公社的古河大队和胜利大队在大种秋菜中是竞赛对手，古河大队有种菜的经验，种秋菜的数量和质量都超过了胜利大队。在菜田管理中，古河大队发扬了共产主义风格，积极支援胜利大队，使胜利大队赶上了自己。
    胜利大队菜苗不足，要补栽和移栽有很大的困难。古河大队队长李恒才于是带领本队种菜能手丰安宗等六名社员，挑着六百七十多斤菜秧来到胜利大队，他们一边帮助抢栽，一边传授技术。在四天中，胜利大队由原来栽菜二百六十亩，增加到五百二十亩，许多社员还学习了古河大队的管菜经验，做到了勤追肥、勤除地、勤浇水。
    现在这两个队的秋菜都长得很好。
