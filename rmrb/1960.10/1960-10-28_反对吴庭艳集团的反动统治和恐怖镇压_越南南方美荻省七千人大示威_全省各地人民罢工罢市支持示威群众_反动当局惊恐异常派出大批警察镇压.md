Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 26th - Saigon News: In southern Vietnam, over seven thousand people from Cai Be, Cai Lay and Chau Thanh districts of My Tho province gathered in the provincial capital, My Tho city, on the morning of September 29th to submit a letter of protest to the pseudo-provincial governor, opposing terrorist suppression, forced relocation, conscription, and the establishment of "agrovilles."
　　The Ngo Dinh Diem clique was extremely alarmed. They issued alerts, dispatched police to surround various intersections, threatening and intimidating the people, arresting one hundred and ninety people, and using hundreds of vehicles to encircle the demonstrating masses on streets stretching about ten kilometers.
　　However, they failed to crush the people's fierce will to struggle. The demonstrating masses continued to surge into the streets of My Tho city like a flood. More than a thousand people gathered in front of the pseudo-provincial governor's office, and also carried out propaganda and persuasion work among the soldiers. The demonstrating masses received the support of the residents of My Tho city, who helped them solve the problems of food and water.
　　On September 30th, the people of My Tho province continued to strike and close markets. In My Tho city alone, 80% of the people had already gone on strike and closed markets, in response to this province-wide struggle. (Attached picture)
　　The working people of South Vietnam are constantly waging various struggles to resist the exploitation of the My-Ngo group. This is a general strike by workers at the Nha Be port in Saigon demanding increased wages and improved living conditions. Xinhua News Agency draft
