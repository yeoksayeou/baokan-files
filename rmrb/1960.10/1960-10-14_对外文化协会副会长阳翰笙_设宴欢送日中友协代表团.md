Xinhua News Agency, October 13th. Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, hosted a banquet this evening to bid farewell to all friends of the delegation from the Japan-China Friendship Association, headed by Shinichiro Omori.

In his speech at the banquet, Yang Hansheng praised Mr. Shinichiro Omori and the friends of the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation for their contributions to the signing of the joint statement between eight Chinese people's organizations and twelve Japanese visiting delegations. He pointed out that this joint statement is of great significance for strengthening and consolidating the friendly unity between the people of China and Japan in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and for safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

Yang Han-sheng said that establishing normal relations between China and Japan on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence is in line with the wishes and interests of the two peoples. He emphasized that the new Japanese government headed by Ikeda continues to follow the United States, is hostile to China, creates the "two Chinas" plot, revives Japanese militarism, and undermines the normal development of Sino-Japanese relations, which is intolerable to the people of China and Japan.

Yang Hansheng expressed deep condolences for the unfortunate death of Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, who was assassinated by a fascist thug, and expressed strong indignation at the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries for condoning the assassination by thugs. He said: The Chinese people will always support the just and patriotic struggle of the Japanese people against the United States. The struggle of the Japanese people will surely achieve final victory.

Shinichiro Omori, the head of the delegation, delivered a speech at the banquet and read out the delegation's resolution on the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party.

The resolution pointed out that the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma is the most blatant manifestation of the Ikeda government's subservience to the United States and its implementation of traitorous and reactionary policies.

The resolution said that after Ikeda came to power, he challenged the Japanese people's demand to abolish the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, intensified the expansion of armaments and war preparations, exposed that he was a faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism, and exposed his true face of gradually and maliciously revising the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.

The resolution said that the Ikeda Cabinet not only did not show friendly sincerity to China, but also did not fundamentally change its policy of continuing to be hostile to China. The political essence of the Ikeda Cabinet is not only similar to that of Nobusuke Kishi, but is even worse and more reactionary.

The resolution pointed out that the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries knew that they could not prevent the strengthening and development of the broad united front of the Japanese people, so they assassinated Asanuma, the Chairman of the Socialist Party, who stood at the forefront of the struggle. The peace-loving Japanese people will not let Asanuma's blood be shed in vain. The Japanese people will continue to fight. In the struggle against the common enemy—U.S. imperialism—the Japanese people and the Chinese people are comrades-in-arms formed by the strongest and deepest friendship.

Shinichiro Omori finally stated on behalf of all members of the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation that after completing their visit to China and returning to Japan, they will immediately rush to various parts of Japan to launch a thorough struggle against U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionary fascists, against war policies, and for peaceful coexistence and the friendship between China and Japan and the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Zhao Anbo, Lin Lin, Hu Chengfang, Shen Zijiu, Yang Zheng, Sun Pinghua, Ni Peijun, Huang Ganying, Xie Nanguang and many others attended the banquet. Japanese peace personage Kinkazu Saionji and Korean peace personage Hwang Bong-koo, who were in Beijing, also attended the banquet.

    对外文化协会副会长阳翰笙
    设宴欢送日中友协代表团
    新华社13日讯　中国人民对外文化协会副会长阳翰笙今晚举行宴会，欢送以大森真一郎为首的日中友好协会代表团全体朋友。
    阳翰笙在宴会上的讲话中，赞扬大森真一郎先生和日中友好协会代表团的朋友们对签订中国八个人民团体和日本十二个访华代表团的共同声明所作出的贡献。他指出，这个共同声明，对加强和巩固中日两国人民在反对美帝国主义的斗争中的友好团结，对保卫亚洲和世界和平有着重要意义。
    阳翰笙说，在和平共处五项原则的基础上建立中日两国的正常关系，是符合两国人民的愿望和利益的。他强调说，以池田为首的日本新政府继续追随美国，敌视中国，制造“两个中国”的阴谋，复活日本军国主义，破坏中日关系的正常发展，这是中日两国人民所不能容忍的。
    阳翰笙对日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎遭到法西斯暴徒行刺不幸去世表示沉痛的悼念，对日美反动派纵容暴徒的刺杀行为表示强烈的愤慨。他说：中国人民永远支持日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争。日本人民的斗争必将取得最后胜利。
    代表团团长大森真一郎在宴会上致词并宣读了代表团就日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎被暗杀事件所作的决议。
    这个决议指出，浅沼稻次郎被暗杀是池田政府仆从美国和执行卖国反动政策的最露骨的表现。
    决议说，池田上台后向要求废除日美安全条约的日本人民挑战，加紧扩军备战，暴露了他是美帝国主义的忠实走狗，暴露了他逐步、恶劣地修改日美安全条约的真面目。
    决议说，池田内阁不仅没有对中国表示友好诚意，而且根本没有改变继续敌视中国的政策，池田内阁的政治本质不只是类似岸信介，而且是更坏、更反动。
    决议指出，日美反动派知道了不能阻止日本人民的广泛的统一战线的加强和发展，就暗杀了站在斗争最前列的社会党委员长浅沼。热爱和平的日本人民不会让浅沼的血白流。日本人民将要继续斗争。在反对共同敌人——美帝国主义的斗争中，日本人民和中国人民是最坚强、最深厚的友谊结成的战友。
    大森真一郎最后代表日中友协代表团全体成员表示，他们在完成访华任务回到日本后，将立即奔向日本各地为展开反对美帝国主义和日本反动的法西斯，反对战争政策并且为和平共处和日中两国的友好、两国邦交的恢复而进行彻底斗争。出席宴会的，有赵安博、林林、胡成放、沈兹九、杨正、孙平化、倪裴君、黄甘英、谢南光等多人。在京的日本和平人士西园寺公一、朝鲜和平人士黄凤九也出席了宴会。
