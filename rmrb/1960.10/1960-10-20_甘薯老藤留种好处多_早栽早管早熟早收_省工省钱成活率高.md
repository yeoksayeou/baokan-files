This newspaper, Hangzhou, 19th, reports: Zhu Shiyue, a seventy-year-old commune member of the Xiatang Production Team in the Tian Shi Commune, Xianju County, Zhejiang Province, through long-term production practice and many years of repeated experiments, has finally obtained advanced experience in using old sweet potato vines for propagation. This breaks the old method of using sweet potatoes for propagation and finds a way to plant sweet potatoes that is more, faster, better, and more economical. This year, this experience has been widely promoted in the Xiatang Production Team and nearby production teams and has achieved large-scale high yields.

According to the experience of Zhu Shiyue and the Xiatang Production Team, the main advantages of using sweet potato vines for propagation are: First, propagation using vines can be done after the last frost (i.e., after Grain Rain), and harvesting can be done around Minor Heat. This not only allows for early planting and management, early maturity, and early harvest, but also advances the planting season for subsequent crops. Second, the survival rate is high. As long as the storage of the vines is well managed and the seedlings are kept fresh, regardless of whether axillary buds have grown at that time, each cutting will survive after insertion. Third, it saves labor and costs.

    甘薯老藤留种好处多
    早栽早管早熟早收　省工省钱成活率高
    本报杭州19日电　浙江省仙居县田市公社寺前大队下塘生产队，七十岁的老社员朱世月，在长期的生产实践中，经过多年多次的试验，终于获得了用甘薯老藤留种的先进经验，打破了历来用甘薯留种的旧方法，找到了一条多快好省地种植甘薯的途径。今年，这个经验已经在下塘生产队和附近各个生产队普遍推广，并且获得了大面积高产。
    根据朱世月和下塘生产队的经验，采取薯藤留种的主要优点是：一是用薯藤留种在终霜期过后（即在谷雨以后）即可扦插，在小暑前后就可收获。这样不但可以早栽早管，早熟早收，而且可以提早后茬作物的播种季节。二是成活率高。只要搞好薯藤贮藏，保证藤苗新鲜，不论当时有否长出腋芽，扦插后就能株株成活。三是省工、省成本。
