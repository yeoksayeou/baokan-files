Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Vice Mayor Wan Li of Beijing delivered a speech at the rally of people from all walks of life in the capital welcoming the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria led by Prime Minister Abbas Ferhat. The full text is as follows:

Your Excellency Prime Minister Abbas Ferhat, distinguished guests of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, friends, comrades:

Our people from all walks of life in the capital are doubly pleased and honored to be able to hold a grand gathering here today, on the occasion of celebrating the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, to welcome the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria headed by Prime Minister Abbas Ferhat. Please allow me, on behalf of the people of all walks of life in the capital, to extend the warmest welcome to His Excellency Prime Minister Abbas, to His Excellency Minister Ben Tobbal Akhdar, and to all the distinguished Algerian guests, and through you to extend our lofty and fraternal salute to the heroic Algerian people.

The heroic Algerian people have made significant contributions to the cause of world peace and are respected by all peoples who are striving for national independence and love peace throughout the world. The Algerian people have been waging a national liberation war for six years. They have suffered all kinds of losses, overcome all difficulties, and have always held high the banner of national liberation war, standing firmly at the forefront of the African people's struggle against imperialism. They have stubbornly resisted hundreds of thousands of French colonial troops and have achieved victory after victory. The Algerian people have become increasingly strong in the struggle. The National Liberation Army has grown from more than three thousand people into a strong fighting force of more than one hundred thousand people, and has liberated large areas of territory. The imperialist policies of aggression and war have suffered increasingly heavy blows. We firmly believe that imperialism is doomed to failure. The heroic struggle of the Algerian people has inspired the determination of the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America to safeguard and strive for national independence, and has strengthened the confidence of the people of all countries in the world to oppose imperialist aggression and defend world peace. The glorious victories constantly won by the Algerian people in their heroic resistance are inseparable from the outstanding leadership of His Excellency Prime Minister Abbas and the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. We believe that as long as we strengthen unity and persist in the struggle, final victory will surely belong to the Algerian people. Although the Algerian people still face difficulties, difficulties cannot frighten awakened and united people. Justice is on the side of the Algerian people, and the people of the world who oppose imperialism and love peace stand on the side of the Algerian people. The just cause is bound to triumph.

The Chinese people, like the Algerian people, have suffered from long-term imperialist aggression and oppression. Our outstanding sons and daughters, in order to strive for national liberation, did not hesitate to shed their blood and sacrifice their lives, and waged a long and arduous struggle against all enemies at home and abroad. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the support of the people of all countries, the Chinese people finally overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism that weighed on the heads of the Chinese people, and won freedom and liberation after twenty-two years of revolutionary war. However, the imperialists are always unwilling to accept their defeat, and they vainly attempt to continue their aggression against our country. U.S. imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan, and constantly carries out military provocations against our country. We still face the serious threat of U.S. imperialism. The common historical experience and the common struggle against imperialism have closely linked our two countries together. The people of our two countries have always shared weal and woe, encouraged each other, and supported each other in the common struggle against imperialism. The Chinese people have always cared for and supported the struggle of our Algerian brothers and sisters for national liberation as if it were their own cause. Every crime committed by imperialism in suppressing the Algerian people has aroused the great indignation of the Chinese people. Every victory report from you has made us feel infinitely happy and encouraged. The 650 million Chinese people have always, now, and in the future, firmly supported your just struggle and always stood on the side of the Algerian people!

At present, although the French aggressors have suffered serious defeats in Algeria, due to the aggressive nature of imperialism, they are still making a dying struggle. Facts have proved that imperialism, forced by the situation, sometimes has to change its tactics and change some new tones and new methods, but their aggressive nature will never change. While carrying out cruel suppression of the Algerian people, the French colonialists hypocritically expressed their recognition of the principle of the Algerian people's "right to self-determination." When the envoys of the Algerian Provisional Government in Melun requested negotiations with the French government on the "conditions and guarantees of self-determination," the French government openly refused, which fully exposed the true face of the French colonialists, supported by U.S. imperialism, in deceiving world opinion. Imperialism has always had two hands in dealing with the national liberation struggles of the oppressed countries: one hand is armed suppression, and the other is political deception. Therefore, in order to win their victory, the revolutionary people must treat the counter-revolutionary two hands with revolutionary two hands. Prime Minister Abbas said it well, "While seeking negotiations and giving peace every opportunity, we must strengthen our combat means and armed struggle. Independence is not readily available, it must be won." The Chinese people fully support the Algerian people in not excluding the struggle for national independence through equal negotiations while never laying down their arms and persisting in resistance, and this struggle is used to constantly expose the deception of imperialism, so as to benefit the Algerian people in achieving final victory.

The bloody suppression of the Algerian people by the French colonialists has been strongly supported by U.S. imperialism and the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" group. Prime Minister Abbas once pointed out: "If the French war machine did not have the support of the entire North Atlantic Treaty Organization, mainly the United States, in terms of weapons, finance, and equipment, it would never have been able to do this." At present, U.S. imperialism's ambition to aggressively invade Africa has become increasingly exposed. U.S. imperialism not only provides a large amount of military and financial assistance to the French aggressors and actively participates in the colonial war of massacring the Algerian people, but also actively supports the barbaric racial discrimination policy of the South African Federal authorities and actively supports the Belgian colonial authorities in suppressing the Congolese people. Recently, U.S. imperialism is attempting to expand its sinful activities of invading the Congo under the banner of the United Nations to the entire Africa and other regions of the world. The purpose of U.S. imperialism is to further utilize and control the United Nations, to intensify the plunder and intervention in Asia, Africa, and Latin America under the guise of "aid" to underdeveloped countries, and to suppress the national democratic movements in these regions. U.S. imperialism is conspiring to promote its usual trick of using Asians to fight Asians and Latin Americans to fight Latin Americans to Africa, vainly attempting to achieve its ambition of swallowing the Congo and encompassing Africa by the evil means of using Congolese to fight Congolese and Africans to fight Africans, thereby replacing the position of old-brand colonialism. These facts irrefutably prove that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the people of Asia and Latin America, and also the most vicious enemy of the African people. We are pleased to see that the African people, through their own struggle experience, are increasingly clearly recognizing the true face of U.S. imperialism, this insidious and cunning neo-colonialist, and are fighting more tenaciously against all the conspiracies of colonialism with doubled unity.

At present, the entire Africa and the whole world are in an excellent situation. The national independence movement of the African people has swept across the entire African continent. So far, in two-thirds of the African land, in the African region that accounts for three-quarters of the total African population, has gained independence or preliminary independence. A magnificent people's movement against imperialism and colonialism, striving for national independence and democratic freedom, and striving for and safeguarding world peace is rising on a global scale. Socialist forces, national independence movement forces, people's revolutionary struggle forces, and all peace forces are uniting and forming an increasingly broad united front. The development of the world situation is becoming increasingly favorable to the people of all countries in the world, and unfavorable to imperialism and all reactionaries. We are pleased to see that the heroic Algerian people are becoming increasingly brave in their resolute and fruitful struggle against imperialism under this excellent situation. We firmly believe that the future belongs to the Algerian people, and an independent and free Algeria will stand tall on the bright African land.

Your Excellency Prime Minister, please convey the friendly wishes and lofty respect of the 650 million Chinese people to the Algerian people, and tell them: the Chinese people will always be the most reliable friends of the Algerian people.

Let us shout:

Long live the heroic Algerian people!

Long live the militant friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people!

Long live the national independence movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America!

Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

Long live world peace!

    在首都各界人民欢迎阿巴斯总理的大会上
    万里副市长的讲话
    新华社4日讯　北京市副市长万里在首都各界人民欢迎阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理率领的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团大会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理阁下，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团的全体贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    我们首都各界人民，今天能够在欢庆中华人民共和国建国十一周年的日子里，在这里举行盛大的集会，欢迎以阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团，我们感到加倍的愉快和荣幸。请允许我代表首都各界人民向阿巴斯总理阁下，向本·陶巴勒·阿赫达尔部长阁下，向阿尔及利亚的全体贵宾们，表示最热烈的欢迎，并且通过你们向英雄的阿尔及利亚人民，致以崇高的兄弟般的战斗敬礼。
    英雄的阿尔及利亚人民为世界和平事业作了重大的贡献，受到全世界一切正在争取民族独立和爱好和平的人民的尊敬。阿尔及利亚人民进行民族解放战争已经六年了，他们遭受各种损失，克服一切困难，始终高举着民族解放战争的大旗，坚定地站在非洲人民反对帝国主义斗争的最前线。他们顽强地抗击几十万法国殖民军，取得了一次又一次的胜利。阿尔及利亚人民在战斗中锻炼得日益坚强，民族解放军已由三千多人发展成为一支拥有十多万人的强大的战斗部队，并且解放了大片国土。帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，遭到越来越沉重的打击。我们坚信，帝国主义是注定要失败的。阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争，鼓舞了非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲各国人民维护和争取民族独立的斗争决心，加强了全世界各国人民反对帝国主义侵略保卫世界和平的信心。阿尔及利亚人民在英勇抗战中不断赢得的光辉胜利，是同阿巴斯总理阁下和阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的卓越领导分不开的。我们相信，只要加强团结，坚持斗争，最后胜利一定属于阿尔及利亚人民。虽然阿尔及利亚人民面前还有困难，但困难吓不倒觉悟了的和团结着的人民。正义在阿尔及利亚人民一边，全世界反对帝国主义和爱好和平的人民都站在阿尔及利亚人民一边。正义的事业是一定要胜利的。
    中国人民同阿尔及利亚人民一样，曾经遭受帝国主义长期的侵略和压迫。我国的优秀儿女，为争取民族解放，不惜抛头颅、洒热血，同一切内外敌人进行了长期的艰苦的斗争。中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在各国人民的支持下，经过了二十二年的革命战争，终于推翻了压在中国人民头上的帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，获得了自由和解放。但是，帝国主义总是不甘心自己的失败的，它们妄图继续侵略我国，美帝国主义现在还霸占着我国的领土台湾，并且不断对我国进行军事挑衅，我们仍然面临着美帝国主义的严重威胁。我们两国的共同历史遭遇和反对帝国主义的共同斗争，使我们紧密地联系在一起。我们两国人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，一向是休戚与共、互相鼓舞、互相支持的。中国人民总是像关心自己的事业一样，关心和支持阿尔及利亚兄弟姊妹们争取民族解放的斗争。帝国主义镇压阿尔及利亚人民的每一个罪行，都激起了中国人民的极大愤慨。从你们那里传来的每一个胜利捷报，都使我们感到无限的欢欣和鼓舞。六亿五千万中国人民过去、现在和将来都始终一贯地坚决支持你们的正义斗争，始终站在阿尔及利亚人民一边！
    目前，法国侵略者在阿尔及利亚虽然遭受了严重的失败，但是，由于帝国主义的侵略本性，它还在进行垂死的挣扎。事实证明，帝国主义迫于形势，有时不得不改变策略，更换一些新的腔调和新的手法，但是，它们的侵略本性是决不会改变的。法国殖民主义者在对阿尔及利亚人民进行残酷镇压的同时，虚伪地表示承认阿尔及利亚人民“自决权”的原则。当阿尔及利亚临时政府的使者在默伦要求同法国政府就“自决的条件和保证”进行谈判的时候，法国政府竟公然予以拒绝，这就充分暴露了在美帝国主义支持下法国殖民主义者欺骗世界舆论的真面目。帝国主义对待各被压迫国家的民族解放斗争，从来就有两手：一手是武装镇压，另一手就是政治欺骗。因此，为了赢得自己的胜利，革命的人民必须以革命的两手对待反革命的两手。阿巴斯总理说得好，“在寻求谈判和给予和平一切机会的同时，我们必须加强我们的战斗手段和武装斗争。独立不是垂手可得的，它必须是赢得的。”中国人民完全支持阿尔及利亚人民在决不放下武器、坚持抗战的同时，不排除通过平等谈判，来进行争取民族独立的斗争，而这种斗争又用来不断地揭露帝国主义的欺骗，以利于阿尔及利亚人民取得最后的胜利。
    法国殖民主义者对阿尔及利亚人民的血腥镇压一直受到美帝国主义和“北大西洋公约组织”集团的大力支持。阿巴斯总理曾经指出：“假如法国的战争机器没有整个北大西洋公约组织、主要是美国的武器、财政和装备方面的支援，它本来是决不会做到这种地步的。”目前，美帝国主义大肆侵略非洲的野心已日益暴露。美帝国主义不但向法国侵略者提供了大量的军事和财政援助，积极参与屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的殖民战争，而且积极支持南非联邦当局野蛮的种族歧视政策，积极支持比利时殖民当局镇压刚果人民。最近，美帝国主义正在企图把它在联合国旗帜下侵略刚果的一套罪恶活动，扩大到整个非洲和世界其他地区。美帝国主义的目的就是企图进一步利用和控制联合国，在“援助”不发达国家的名义的掩盖下，加紧掠夺和干涉亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，并且镇压这些地区的民族民主运动。美帝国主义正在阴谋把它利用亚洲人打亚洲人、拉丁美洲人打拉丁美洲人的惯技，推行到非洲，妄图以刚果人打刚果人、非洲人打非洲人的邪恶手段，实现其鲸吞刚果和囊括非洲的野心，从而取代老牌殖民主义的地位。这些事实无可争辩地证明，美帝国主义是亚洲、拉丁美洲人民的最凶恶的敌人，也是非洲人民的最凶恶的敌人。我们高兴地看到，非洲人民通过自己的斗争经验，正在日益清楚地认识到美帝国主义这一阴险狡猾的新殖民主义者的真面目，并且正在以加倍的团结来同殖民主义的一切阴谋进行更加顽强的斗争。
    目前，整个非洲和全世界是一片大好形势。非洲人民的民族独立运动，已经席卷了整个非洲大陆。到目前为止，在三分之二的非洲土地上，占全非人口四分之三的非洲地区，已经获得独立或初步独立。一个波澜壮阔的反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取民族独立和民主自由、争取和维护世界和平的人民运动，正在世界范围内兴起。社会主义力量、民族独立运动力量、人民革命斗争力量和一切和平力量正在团结起来，并且形成日益广泛的统一战线。世界局势的发展越来越有利于世界各国人民，而不利于帝国主义和一切反动派。我们高兴地看到英雄的阿尔及利亚人民在这一大好形势下面，越来越奋勇地同帝国主义进行坚决而有成果的斗争。我们坚信，未来的日子一定属于阿尔及利亚人民，一个独立自由的阿尔及利亚必将巍然屹立于光明的非洲大地上。
    总理阁下，请你把六亿五千万中国人民的友好祝愿和崇高敬意带给阿尔及利亚人民，并且告诉他们：中国人民永远是阿尔及利亚人民的最可靠朋友。
    让我们高呼：
    英雄的阿尔及利亚人民万岁！
    中国和阿尔及利亚人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族独立运动万岁！
    全世界人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
