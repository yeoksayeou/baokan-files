Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 12th: The Wuchang People's Commune in Wuhan City, through organizing large, medium, and small enterprises in close collaboration, has promoted the rapid development of local industrial production, demonstrating the powerful vitality of urban people's communes.

    The Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Wuchang People's Commune, during the establishment of the commune, organized large, medium, and small enterprises to engage in large-scale production collaboration in flexible and diverse forms. With the consolidation and development of the People's Commune, the collaborative zones of large, medium, and small enterprises throughout the commune have developed. The three most common forms of collaboration are: First, organizing a production collaboration network with state-owned large factories as the backbone, combining large, medium, and small factories. This involves implementing "three link-ups" in a led and planned manner: that is, large factories under the central, provincial, and municipal authorities are linked with commune-owned medium and small factories, commune-owned medium and small factories are linked with street-owned small factories, and small factories established in 1958 are linked with small factories established this year. This form of collaboration enables large, medium, and small factories to help and support each other under the unified leadership of the commune Party committee, not only promoting the overall development of large, medium, and small factories but also laying the foundation for establishing various specialized and complete collaborative systems. Currently, to further develop this collaborative relationship, the commune has also organized specialized supporting collaboration, with a large factory as the backbone, organizing similar large, medium, and small factories together, comprehensively utilizing raw materials under unified planning, so that raw materials can play a fuller role. In this collaborative network, large factories provide support to small factories in terms of technology, equipment, and raw materials, while small factories complete the processing tasks of large factories with guaranteed quality, quantity, and time according to the collaborative plan. At present, the entire commune has established seven specialized production collaboration networks with large factories such as Wuchang Vehicle Factory and the First Cotton Mill as the backbone, organizing more than 300 large, medium, and small factories into these seven collaboration networks.
    Second, common facilities (maintenance, sand casting, power equipment, etc.) are uniformly organized among adjacent different factories and enterprises, and they are used in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit. In this way, the past situation of factories being adjacent to each other but not interacting is broken, and the potential of production equipment is more fully utilized. For example, in the past, some factories, such as Wuchang Foundry, Asia Iron Factory, and Universe Model Factory, did not have enough equipment to meet their needs, which affected production, while others had surplus equipment capacity. After these three factories implemented collaboration, the casting equipment was uniformly organized and used, which solved the above-mentioned contradictions, greatly increased production, and also saved some equipment and factory buildings.
    Third, among medium and small factories with roughly the same production nature, the same types of work and products are uniformly adjusted, and labor is reasonably divided to form a collaborative form of joint production. Through this collaboration, planned tasks are uniformly arranged according to the principle of mutual benefit, equipment and tools are uniformly allocated and used, labor is uniformly deployed, and raw materials are uniformly allocated for comprehensive utilization, so that a small amount of manpower, materials, and financial resources can play a greater role, achieving both increased production and savings.
    Experience over the past few months has proven that the result of organizing these three forms of collaboration among large, medium, and small factories in the Wuchang People's Commune has effectively adjusted and improved production relations and promoted an overall leap forward in the commune's industrial production. By the beginning of September, the output of fifteen products in the entire district had overfulfilled this year's plan, and the output of thirteen products had completed more than 80% of this year's plan. The completed industrial output value accounted for 78.98% of the annual plan.
    After medium and small factories are linked up with large factories for collaboration, they can relatively stably utilize the side materials and waste materials of large factories, further tapping the potential of raw materials, and promoting new development in the production of daily-use small commodities. Among the industries under the commune management area, about 40% are factories that produce daily necessities, and a large part of their raw materials are waste materials from large factories.

    组织大中小企业密切协作
    武昌人民公社生产全面跃进
    新华社武汉12日电　武汉市武昌人民公社通过组织大、中、小企业大协作，促进当地工业生产的迅速发展，显示出了城市人民公社的强大生命力。
    武昌人民公社的中共党委在建社过程中就组织大、中、小企业，采用灵活多样的形式进行生产大协作。随着人民公社的巩固和发展，全社大、中、小企业的协作区有了发展。最普遍的三种协作形式是：一、以国营大厂为骨干组织大、中、小厂三结合的生产协作网。这就是有领导、有计划地实行“三挂钩”，即：中央、省、市所属大厂与社属中、小厂挂钩，社属中、小厂与街属小厂挂钩，1958年兴办的小厂与今年兴办的小厂挂钩。这种协作形式，就是使大、中、小工厂在公社党委的统一领导下互相帮助、互相支持，不但促进了大、中、小厂的全面发展，并为建立各种专业性的配套成龙的协作体系打下了基础。目前为使这种协作关系更进一步得到发展，公社还组织了专业性的配套协作，即以一个大工厂为骨干，把同类的大、中、小工厂组织起来，在统一的规划下综合利用原料材料，使原料材料更充分地发挥作用。在这个协作网中，大厂从技术、设备、原料材料等方面给小厂以支援，小厂则根据协作规划，保质、保量、保时间地完成大厂的加工任务。现在，全社已经以武昌车辆厂、第一纱厂等大厂为骨干，建立起机器制造、纺织等七个专业性的生产协作网，组织到这七个协作网中的大、中、小工厂共有三百多个。
    二、在相邻的不同工厂企业之间，把共同性的设施（维修、翻砂、动力设备等）统一组织起来，根据互惠互利的原则互相利用。这样，就打破了过去那种厂房毗连、互不往来的局面，更充分地发挥了生产设备的潜力。例如武昌铸造厂、亚洲铁工厂和宇宙模型厂过去有的厂设备不够用，影响生产，有的设备能力有余，这三个厂在实行协作以后，把铸造设备统一组织使用，解决了上述矛盾，生产大大提高，还节省出了部分设备和厂房。
    三、在生产性质大体相同的中、小工厂中，把相同的工种、产品，统一调整，合理分工，组成联合生产的协作形式。通过这种协作，按照互利原则统一安排计划任务，统一调剂使用设备、工具，统一调配劳动力，统一调剂综合利用原料材料，可以使少量的人力、物力、财力发挥更大的作用，做到既增产又节约。
    几个月来的经验证明，武昌人民公社在大、中、小厂之间组织这三种形式的协作的结果，已经有效地调整和改善了生产关系，促进了全社工业生产的全面跃进。到9月上旬止，全区已有十五种产品的产量超额完成了今年计划，十三种产品完成了今年计划的80％以上，完成工业总产值占全年计划的78.98％。
    中、小工厂和大厂挂钩协作后，可以比较固定地利用大厂的边材余料，进一步挖掘了原料材料的潜力，使日用小商品生产有了新的发展。公社管理区所属工业中，约有40％是生产日用品的工厂，它们的原料材料有很大一部分是利用大厂的边角废料。（附图片）
