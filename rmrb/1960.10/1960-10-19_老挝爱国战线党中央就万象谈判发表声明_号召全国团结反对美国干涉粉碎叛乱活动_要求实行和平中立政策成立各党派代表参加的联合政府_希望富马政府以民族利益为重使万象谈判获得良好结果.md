Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th - According to a broadcast today by the Lao Fighting Forces Radio, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on the negotiations between the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Patriotic Front, demanding that all forces in Laos that love the country and peace, first and foremost the Souvanna Phouma government and the Lao Patriotic Front, unite and heighten vigilance to resolutely oppose the aggression and interference of US imperialism and to crush all rebellious and divisive activities by the Phoumi Nosavan clique, the running dogs of US imperialism.

The statement, after recounting a series of aggressive and interventionist activities by US imperialism since the signing of the Vientiane Agreement in 1957 and its support for traitorous regimes that sabotaged the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements and launched a civil war, pointed out that the Lao people have clearly recognized US imperialism and its running dogs as the enemies of the Lao nation.

The statement, in discussing the situation since the coup launched by the Vientiane military and civilians led by Kong Le and the establishment of the Phouma government, said, "Faced with the victory of the Lao people, US imperialism is impatiently trying to restore the position of the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group and continue its consistent vicious conspiracies, namely to eliminate patriotic forces and turn Laos into a new-style colony and military base. They are stepping up efforts to instigate the reactionary groups in Thailand and South Vietnam to vigorously support the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group in attacking Vientiane, imposing economic blockades, sowing discord, attempting to overthrow the legitimate Phouma government, gathering the rebels into a so-called ‘Revolutionary Committee,’ announcing the abolition of the constitution, carrying out conspiracies to divide the country, introducing US imperialism's increasingly deep and blatant interference in Laos, and attempting to introduce the troops of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and the United Nations police force into Laos, hindering Laos from moving towards a path of peace and neutrality. Even more blatant is the recent US imperialism's cessation of aid to Laos, sending Assistant Secretary of State Parsons to Vientiane to exert pressure, coercing the King and the Phouma government to make concessions to the Phoumi Nosavan group, undermining the negotiations between the Royal Government and the Lao Patriotic Front, and obstructing the national harmony of the Lao people, so that Laos continues its fratricidal civil war, making the motherland, which has suffered from fifteen years of war, even weaker. This is a serious crisis that is constantly threatening the fate of our motherland and the lives of the people, and threatening the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia."

The statement pointed out that the current life-and-death struggle in Laos is a struggle between the people of Laos, all parties that love the country and peace, and support and resolutely fight for peace, neutrality, national harmony, and national unification, including the Phouma government, and US imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group, which deliberately obstruct and sabotage peace and neutrality, and conspire to turn Laos into a new-style colony and war base.

The statement said, "In order to achieve the noble goal of our motherland—to enable Laos to achieve independence, sovereignty, national harmony, and unification, and to move towards a truly peaceful and neutral path—the main task of the people of the whole country is to oppose the aggression and interference of US imperialism and to crush all rebellious and divisive activities of the Phoumi Nosavan group. This is an important and urgent goal of the current struggle of the forces that love the country and peace and the Phouma government, and it is also the noble task of this negotiation between the Lao Patriotic Front and the Royal Government."

The statement said that in order to meet the urgent aspirations of the people of the whole country and correctly solve the main problems of the motherland, this negotiation between the Lao Patriotic Front and the Royal Government must seek all measures to unite all forces that love the country and peace into a strong force to support and promote the Phouma government to implement a policy of true peace and neutrality, national harmony, and national unification, oppose the interference of US imperialism, and crush the forces of the Phoumi Nosavan group and all rebellious activities.

The statement said that in order to achieve the purpose of this negotiation, the Lao Patriotic Front, loyal to the highest interests of the motherland and the people, and loyal to peace, neutrality, national harmony, and national unification, hereby proposes the following principles as the content of the negotiations between the two parties:

(1) Unite all nationalities, strata, parties, and people who love the country and peace to oppose the aggression and interference of the United States and all rebellious activities of their running dog, the Phoumi Nosavan group, to unify the motherland, harmonize the Lao people, protect the motherland, religion, the King, and the constitution, and build Lao into a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous country.

(2) Establish a coalition government that includes representatives from all nationalities, parties, and people who love the country and peace, including representatives from the Lao Patriotic Front, the coup committee, and the peace and neutrality committee.

Consolidate local governments at all levels to ensure the full implementation of the coalition government's policies.

For those who have gone astray in the government and military systems and have been forced to oppose the government, as long as they repent and return to the government side, the government will not hold them accountable and will give them appropriate work to serve the motherland.

Those stubborn elements who do not know how to repent, still engage in treason and harm the people, sabotage the policy of peace and neutrality and national harmony, create civil war, cause the Lao people to kill each other, and conspire to divide the motherland, will be given appropriate punishment.

(3) In accordance with the provisions of the constitution, truly realize the people's rights to freedom and democracy, release the illegally arrested cadres and soldiers of the Lao Patriotic Front and other patriotic people; guarantee the free activities of all parties that love the country and peace, abolish all dictatorial laws and all special agent organizations established by the Phoumi Nosavan group; and then, in accordance with the principles of free, democratic, universal, direct, and secret voting as stipulated in the 1957 election law, hold general elections correctly.

(4) On the basis of being suitable for guaranteeing true national harmony and consolidating the national army, unify all patriotic armed forces in order to consolidate neutrality and defend the motherland.

(5) Implement a foreign policy in accordance with the principles of true peace and neutrality and the spirit of the Geneva Agreement and the Bandung Conference. Establish diplomatic relations with all countries that respect Lao's national sovereignty, regardless of differences in political and social systems, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and first establish friendly relations with neighboring countries.

Accept assistance from all countries in both camps that are willing to help Laos without any political or military strings attached, and first accept assistance from socialist countries and peaceful and neutral countries.

(6) Pay attention to the development of economy and culture, build transportation lines, develop education and health undertakings, encourage and help the people increase production, and improve the material and spiritual life of all ethnic groups.

The statement said, "The above points are the purpose and content of this negotiation, and also the program of struggle for all Lao people who love the country and peace. Only by doing this can our beloved Laos get rid of the disaster of civil war and the enslavement of imperialism. Only by doing this can we create the necessary conditions for Laos to be harmonious and for the cooperation between the Lao Patriotic Front and the Royal Government to be consolidated. Only by doing this can we correctly conform to the spirit of the Geneva Agreement and the Vientiane Agreement."

The statement expressed the hope that the government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma, as prime minister, would see the crisis of the motherland and should put the highest interests of the nation first, and strive to achieve good results in this negotiation in order to meet the most urgent aspirations of all Lao people.

The statement finally called on all compatriots across the country, regardless of class, ethnicity, and religion, regardless of peasants, workers, businessmen, students, intellectuals, staff, soldiers, police, parties, royal family members, and monks who love the country and peace, to unite and support the above-mentioned program put forward by the Lao Patriotic Front, and to make this negotiation achieve victory in accordance with the wishes of the people of the whole country.

    号召全国团结反对美国干涉粉碎叛乱活动
    要求实行和平中立政策成立各党派代表参加的联合政府
    希望富马政府以民族利益为重使万象谈判获得良好结果
    新华社河内17日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会就老挝王国政府和老挝爱国战线党之间的谈判发表声明，要求老挝一切爱祖国、爱和平的力量，首先是梭发那·富马政府和老挝爱国战线党，要团结一致，提高警惕，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略和干涉和粉碎美帝国主义走狗富米·诺萨万集团一切叛乱和分裂国家的活动。
    声明在追述了1957年签订万象协议以来美帝国主义一系列侵略和干涉活动和它扶植卖国政权破坏日内瓦和万象协议、发动内战的罪恶历史以后指出，美帝国主义的侵略和干涉活动使老挝人民清楚地认识到美帝国主义和它的走狗是老挝民族的敌人。
    声明在谈到以贡勒为首的万象军民发动政变和富马政府成立以来的形势后说，“面对老挝人民的胜利，美帝国主义迫不及待地力图恢复富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的地位，并继续它们一贯采取的恶毒阴谋，即消灭爱国力量，把老挝变为新式殖民地和军事基地。它们正在加紧策动泰国和越南南方的反动集团大力支持富米·诺萨万叛乱集团进攻万象，实行经济封锁，挑拨离间，企图推翻富马合法政府，把叛乱分子纠集到所谓
  ‘革命委员会’，宣布废除宪法，进行分裂国家的阴谋，引进美帝国主义日益深入地、露骨地干涉老挝、并且企图把东南亚侵略集团的军队和联合国的警察部队引入老挝，阻挠老挝走向和平中立道路。更加明目张胆的是，最近美帝国主义停止了对老挝的援助，派助理国务卿帕森斯到万象施加压力，要挟国王和富马政府向富米·诺萨万集团让步，破坏王国政府同老挝爱国战线党之间的谈判，阻挠老挝人民的民族和睦，以使老挝继续兄弟相残的内战，使得曾经遭受十五年战争摧残的祖国更加衰弱。这是正在时时刻刻威胁着我们祖国的命运和人民的生活、威胁着印度支那和东南亚和平的严重危机。”
    声明指出，老挝当前的生死存亡的斗争，是老挝全国人民、爱祖国爱和平、赞成和坚决为和平中立、民族和睦、国家统一而斗争的各党派，包括富马政府，同蓄意阻挠和破坏和平中立，阴谋把老挝变成新式殖民地和战争基地的美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的斗争。
    声明说，“为了达到我们祖国的崇高的目的——使老挝获得独立、主权、民族和睦和统一，走向真正的和平中立道路，全国人民的主要任务是，反对美帝国主义的侵略和干涉和粉碎富米·诺萨万集团的一切叛乱和分裂国家的活动。这是爱祖国、爱和平力量和富马政府的当前斗争的重要的、迫切的目标，这也是老挝爱国战线党同王国政府这一次谈判的崇高的任务。”
    声明说，为了满足全国人民的迫切愿望，正确地解决祖国的主要问题，老挝爱国战线党同王国政府的这一次谈判必须寻求一切措施，把一切爱祖国、爱和平的力量团结成为一个坚强的力量，来支持和促使富马政府实行真正的和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家的政策，反对美帝国主义的干涉，粉碎富米·诺萨万集团的势力和一切叛乱的活动。
    声明说，为了使这次谈判达到目的，忠于祖国和人民最高利益的、忠于和平中立、民族和睦和国家统一的老挝爱国战线党，特提出以下一些原则，作为双方谈判的内容：
    （一）团结全国各民族、各阶层、各党派和爱祖国、爱和平的人士，反对美国的侵略和干涉和它们的走狗富米·诺萨万集团的一切叛乱活动，使祖国统一，老挝人和睦，保护祖国、宗教、国王和宪法，把老挝建设成为一个和平中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的国家。
    （二）成立包括有各民族、各党派和爱祖国、爱和平人士的代表参加的，其中有老挝爱国战线党、政变委员会和和平中立委员会代表参加的联合政府。
    巩固各级地方政权，以保证联合政府各项政策得到充分实现。
    对于那些在政权和军队系统中走错路和被迫反对政府的人们，只要改邪归正，回到政府方面来，政府将不咎既往，并给予他们适当工作为祖国服务。
    对于那些不知悔改，仍然进行叛国害民、破坏和平中立政策和民族和睦、制造内战、使老挝人互相残杀，并阴谋进行祖国分裂活动的顽固的分子，将给以适当的惩治。
    （三）按照宪法的规定，真正地实现人民的自由民主权利，释放被非法逮捕的老挝爱国战线党的干部和战士以及其他爱国人民；保障爱祖国、爱和平的各个党派的自由活动，废除一切独裁法律和富米·诺萨万集团所成立的一切特务组织；进而正确按照1957年的选举法所规定的自由、民主、普遍、直接和秘密投票的原则，举行普选。
    （四）在适合于保障真正的民族和睦和巩固国家军队的基础上，统一所有爱国武装力量，以便巩固中立和保卫祖国。
    （五）按照真正的和平中立原则和日内瓦协议以及万隆会议的精神，实行对外政策。同一切尊重老挝国家主权的、不分政治和社会制度差别的国家，在和平共处五项原则的基础上建立外交关系，首先是同各邻国建立友好关系。
    接受两个阵营的愿意帮助老挝的各国的不附带任何政治和军事的束缚条件的援助，首先接受属于社会主义各国和和平中立各国的援助。
    （六）注意发展经济和文化，修建交通运输线，发展教育和卫生事业，鼓励和帮助人民增加生产，改善各族人民的物质和精神生活。
    声明说，“上述各点是这次谈判的目的和内容，也是一切爱祖国、爱和平的老挝人民的斗争纲领。只有这样做，我们可爱的老挝，才能够摆脱内战的灾祸，才能够摆脱帝国主义的奴役。只有这样做，才能够创造必要条件，使老挝和睦，使老挝爱国战线党和王国政府的合作得到巩固。也只有这样做，才能够正确符合日内瓦协议和万象协议的精神。”
    声明表示，希望以梭发那·富马亲王为首相的政府，看清祖国的危机，应该把民族的最高利益放在第一位，努力地使这次谈判取得良好结果，以满足老挝全体人民的最迫切的愿望。
    声明最后号召全国同胞，不分阶级、民族和宗教，不分农民、工人、商人、学生、知识分子、职员、士兵、警察、各党派、各皇族人士和爱祖国、爱和平的僧侣等，要团结一致，支持老挝爱国战线党提出的上述纲领，并使这次谈判按照全国人民的愿望达到胜利。
