Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi. Xinjiang University, the first comprehensive university in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, was officially established on October 6th. Over a thousand students and teachers of Uyghur, Kazakh, Han, Kyrgyz, and other nationalities held a celebration meeting at the new campus, joyfully celebrating the birth of this new university dedicated to cultivating construction talent from all nationalities for the autonomous region's socialist construction.

Xinjiang University was established under the kind attention and strong support of the Party and the government, marking a new stage in the region's scientific and cultural undertakings. In the early days of liberation, Xinjiang only had Xinjiang College, with no more than ten teaching staff and only over three hundred students. After liberation, the Party and the government allocated large amounts of funds to construct school buildings, purchase instruments and equipment, train teachers, and vigorously develop Xinjiang's higher education, successively establishing eight specialized institutions such as August 1st Agricultural College, Xinjiang Medical College, and Xinjiang Normal College. In 1956, according to the instructions of the Central Committee and the Autonomous Region Party Committee, preparations began to establish a comprehensive Xinjiang University on the basis of Xinjiang College. By the first half of this year, the number of students at Xinjiang College had increased to over one thousand, and the number of teachers had reached more than two hundred and ninety. In particular, a contingent of local ethnic minority university teachers had grown up after nearly ten years of training. Teaching and experimental equipment in various departments have also been established from scratch, laying the foundation for the establishment of Xinjiang University today.

Xinjiang University is a multi-ethnic university, with students from local ethnic minorities such as Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Tatar accounting for 75% of the total number of students, most of whom are children of farmers and herdsmen from rural areas and grasslands. This new type of comprehensive university focuses on science and engineering, and also has arts and sciences departments. It currently consists of eight departments: Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Architecture, Mathematics and Physics, Biochemistry, History and Geography, and Chinese Language and Literature, with fifteen specialties. The university has various well-equipped laboratories, as well as factories, farms, pastures, and botanical gardens as grounds for teaching, labor, and scientific research activities.

The newly built Xinjiang University is located in the center of the new urban area at the foot of the Carp Mountain in the western suburbs of Urumqi, with a beautiful environment. During the construction process, universities in the interior provided assistance in many aspects, from teachers and teaching equipment to teaching materials and data. In recent years, universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an and other places have trained as many as 114 ethnic minority teachers for Xinjiang University.

    培养各民族建设人材的新学府
    新疆第一所综合大学成立
    新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆维吾尔自治区第一所综合大学——新疆大学已经在10月6日正式成立。一千多名维吾尔、哈萨克、汉、柯尔克孜等民族的学生和教师在新校址举行庆祝大会，欢庆这所为自治区社会主义建设事业培养各民族建设人材的新学府的诞生。
    新疆大学是在党和政府的亲切关怀与大力支持下建立起来的，它标志着自治区科学文化事业跨进了一个新的阶段。解放初期，新疆只有一所新疆学院，教学人员不过十名，学生仅有三百多人。解放后，党和政府拨出大量款项，建筑校舍，购买仪器设备，培养教师，大力发展新疆高等教育事业，先后建成了八一农学院、新疆医学院、新疆师范学院等八所专业院校。1956年，根据中央和自治区党委的指示，在新疆学院的基础上，开始筹建综合性的新疆大学。到今年上半年，新疆学院的学生人数已增加到一千多名，教师人数达到二百九十多人，特别是一支当地民族的高等学校教师队伍经过近十年的培养，已经成长起来。各科系的教学、实验的设备也从无到有建立起来，为现在成立新疆大学奠定了基础。
    新疆大学是一所多民族的高等学校，维吾尔、哈萨克、柯尔克孜、塔塔尔等当地少数民族的学生占学生总数75％，他们当中大部分是来自农村和草原上的农牧民子女。这所新型的综合大学以理工为主，并设文科各专业，现有机械、电机、化工、建筑、数理、生化、史地和中国语文等八个系，分设十五个专业。全校有各种设备完善的实验室，有工厂、农场、牧场、植物园等作为教学、劳动和科学研究活动的园地。
    新建的新疆大学座落在乌鲁木齐市西郊鲤鱼山下新市区的中心，环境幽美。在建校过程中，内地各高等院校从教师、教学设备到教材资料曾给予了多方面的帮助。几年来，北京、上海、西安等地的高等院校为新疆大学培养的少数民族教师即达一百十四名。
