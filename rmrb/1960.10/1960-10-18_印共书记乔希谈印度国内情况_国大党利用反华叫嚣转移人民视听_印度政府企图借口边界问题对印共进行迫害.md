Xinhua News Agency, October 16th: According to the "Hindustan Times," CPI Secretariat Secretary Joshi recently stated in Teri, Uttar Pradesh, that in India, "all the clamoring about China is an election tactic of the Congress Party. Its purpose is to divert the people's attention from the chaotic situation occurring domestically."

Joshi also said that in India, "profits are controlled by a few, the rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer."

The newspaper, published on September 28th, stated that Joshi made these remarks at a meeting held by the CPI's local organization in Teri on September 25th. The newspaper's report indicates that Prime Minister Nehru's recent attacks on the CPI for explaining the truth about the Sino-Indian border to the masses as "anti-national propaganda," and the Indian government's attempt to ban such activities of the CPI through legislation, have aroused opposition from local communists.

The "Hindustan Times" said that at the meeting held in Teri, speakers pointed out that India "remains poor after two Five-Year Plans and thirteen years of freedom."

On the same day, the newspaper also published an article on this matter, slandering the CPI for carrying out so-called "subversive and sabotage activities" in India. The newspaper proclaimed that Indian Home Minister Pant had promised that "in order to better maintain national security in the border areas," he would discuss "bills" to deal with the CPI in parliament.

As previously reported, Pant said in Delhi on September 13th that the Indian government would pass a law in the November parliamentary session to "punish anyone who undermines India's security by casting doubt on India's territorial integrity or borders."

    印共书记乔希谈印度国内情况
    国大党利用反华叫嚣转移人民视听
    印度政府企图借口边界问题对印共进行迫害
    新华社16日讯　据“印度斯坦时报”报道，印度共产党书记处书记乔希最近在北方邦的特里发表讲话时曾说，在印度国内“一切有关中国的叫嚷，都是国大党的一种竞选手法。它的目的是转移人民对国内发生的混乱情况的注意。”
    乔希还说，在印度“利润为少数人所掌握，富人越来越富，穷人越来越穷”。
    在9月28日出版的这家报纸说，乔希是在印度共产党特里地方组织9月25日举行的一次会议上说这番话的。这家报纸的消息表明，印度总理尼赫鲁近来攻击印度共产党在群众中说明中印边界真相是“反民族宣传”和印度政府企图通过立法来禁止印度共产党这类活动的作法，已经引起当地共产党人的反对。
    “印度斯坦时报”说，在特里举行的会议上，发言者指出，印度“在经过两个五年计划和十三年的自由以后仍然贫困。”
    这家报纸同天还就此发表文章，污蔑印度共产党在印度进行所谓“颠覆破坏活动”。这家报纸扬言，印度内政部长潘特已答应“为了在边境地区更好地维持国家的安全”，将在议会讨论对付印度共产党的“法案”。
    前已报道，潘特9月13日曾在德里说，印度政府将在11月的议会会议上通过一项法律来“惩办由于对印度的领土完整或边界提出怀疑而破坏印度安全的任何人。”
