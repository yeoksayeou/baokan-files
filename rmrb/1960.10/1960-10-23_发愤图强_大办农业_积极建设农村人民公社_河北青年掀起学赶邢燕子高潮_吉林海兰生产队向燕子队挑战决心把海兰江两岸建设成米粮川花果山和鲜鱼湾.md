Hebei Youth Launch an Upsurge in Learning From and Catching Up With Xing Yanzi
Jilin Hailan Production Team Challenges the Yanzi Team, Determined to Build Both Banks of the Hailan River into a Land of Rice and Grain, Orchards, and Fresh Fish Bays
(Our Report) An upsurge of learning from and catching up with Xing Yanzi, striving to become stronger, vigorously developing agriculture, and actively building rural people's communes, has already been launched among the broad masses of young people in Hebei Province, and has had a tremendous impact on the broad masses of young people throughout the country.
After Xing Yanzi's exemplary deeds were published in the newspapers, they immediately attracted the attention of the Communist Youth League and Women's Federation organizations at all levels in Hebei Province. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Provincial Women's Federation jointly issued a notice, requiring the launch of a movement to learn from and catch up with Xing Yanzi among young people and women throughout the province. Under the unified leadership of the Party committees at all levels, the Communist Youth League and Women's Federation organizations, using a variety of propaganda forms, educated the broad masses of young people to love the countryside, love agricultural labor, and actively build rural people's communes. According to statistics from seventeen cities and counties, including Tangshan, Julu, Gaocheng, Tangxian, and Zhangbei, 800,000 young people have learned about Xing Yanzi's deeds. In addition to publicizing Xing Yanzi's exemplary deeds among the youth of the city, the Communist Youth League Baoding Municipal Committee also commended 38 young activists in the city who were vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the city's youth. The Communist Youth League Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee even called on the broad masses of young people to take Xing Yanzi as an example and play a vanguard role in the current "Three Autumns" work.
After learning about Xing Yanzi's deeds, the broad masses of young people in Hebei Province expressed their determination to be "Yanzi-style" young people, striving to become stronger and build their homes. In Tangshan City alone, more than 12,000 "Yanzi-style" youth shock brigades emerged. A shock brigade composed of more than 290 young women from Xiaochen Village in Gaoyang County expressed to the Party: "Where there is a will, there is a way. If Yanzi can do it, we can certainly do it too." Young people on the fronts of factories, mines, finance, and trade also pledged to strive to become stronger like Xing Yanzi, increase production, improve their work, and support agricultural production. Through study, the youth of Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Coal Mine saw the emergence of 24 youth collectives that greatly exceeded production quotas, and more than 1,500 young people created new achievements in coal extraction. Li Ailan, a young woman working in commerce in Tangshan, went out for the first time to transfer fresh goods, walking more than 80 li alone at night to deliver the goods in a timely manner. When others praised her, she said: Compared to Xing Yanzi, I am far behind. I must be a Xing Yanzi on the commercial front!
Xing Yanzi's red heart for the countryside and dedication to the countryside has greatly educated some intellectual youth who were previously uneasy about agricultural production. After learning about Xing Yanzi's deeds, they realized that the countryside has bright prospects and much to offer, and began to strengthen their confidence in building the countryside. In Donglishuang Production Team of Fengjiazhuang Commune in Zhengding County, there was an educated youth named Qin Xinfeng. After graduating from senior primary school, she failed to get into middle school and was not at ease in rural production. After studying Xing Yanzi's deeds, she said: "Xing Yanzi has pointed out the direction for me. I am determined to learn from Xing Yanzi, make great efforts in the countryside, and make contributions to the people!" Zhao Yuzhen, an educated youth from Liuxinzhuang Production Team of Zhifangtou Commune in Cangxian County, joined agricultural production in February last year after graduating from agricultural middle school. In production, she encountered some difficulties and became a little discouraged, and her thinking wavered somewhat. After seeing Xing Yanzi's deeds of fighting against difficulties in the newspaper, she immediately wrote a letter to Xing Yanzi, expressing that she was not afraid of difficulties or hardship, and was determined to work in the countryside for the rest of her life. At present, she has formed a "Catch Up With Yanzi Shock Brigade" with the young people in the village, determined to transform the Dagalian alkali field north of the village with the energy of Xing Yanzi in transforming Beidawa.
Xing Yanzi's exemplary deeds of loving agriculture have also had a great impact on the educated youth in cities. After studying Xing Yanzi's deeds, more than 13,000 young people in Tangshan urban area requested to go to the agricultural production front and build rural people's communes. At present, 583 young people have formed three youth horticultural teams and settled in the suburbs.
Xing Yanzi's exemplary actions of striving to become stronger, working diligently, and vigorously developing agriculture have not only had a profound impact on the broad masses of young people in Hebei, but have also begun to extend beyond the scope of Hebei Province, becoming a role model for many young people across the country. After Xing Yanzi's deeds were published in the newspapers, many young people wrote to her, expressing that they would learn from her, and launched friendship competitions, joining hands to build the motherland's countryside. National Youth Socialist Construction Activist and leader of Hailan Production Team of Dongsheng People's Commune in Jilin Province, Lü Genze, challenged the Yanzi Team on behalf of all team members after reading about Xing Yanzi's advanced deeds in the newspaper. The challenge letter stated that they would more actively engage in agricultural production to turn both banks of the Hailan River into a land of rice and grain, orchards, and fresh fish bays. The Yanzi Team immediately responded to the challenge, competing with the Hailan Team in the ambition to build rural people's communes, the revolutionary spirit of not fearing hardship and difficulties, the quantity of grain harvested, the vigorous development of sideline occupations and non-staple food production, the spirit of skillful work and research, and the learning of theory and culture. The revolutionary spirit of mutual competition between Xing Yanzi and Lü Genze has aroused a wider response from young people in various regions. The Communist Youth League Pudong County Committee of Shanghai issued a notice calling on all young people in the county to learn from them, carry out a revolutionary competition to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, and quickly launch a competition upsurge to fight the "Three Autumns." National Youth Socialist Construction Activist Lü Meiying has exchanged challenge letters with Zhu Yuqi, a Red Flag Youth Shock Worker in Shanghai, launching a competition craze between novices and veterans.

    发愤图强  大办农业  积极建设农村人民公社
    河北青年掀起学赶邢燕子高潮
    吉林海兰生产队向燕子队挑战决心把海兰江两岸建设成米粮川花果山和鲜鱼湾
    本报讯　一个学赶邢燕子、发愤图强大办农业、积极建设农村人民公社的高潮，已经在河北省广大青年中掀起，并在全国广大青年中发生了巨大的影响。
    邢燕子的模范事迹，在报纸上刊登以后，立即引起了河北省各级青年团和妇联组织的重视。共青团河北省委和省妇联曾联合发出通知，要求在全省青年和妇女群众中，开展一个学赶邢燕子的运动。各级共青团和妇联组织在党委统一领导下，利用多种多样的宣传形式，向广大青年进行了热爱农村、热爱农业劳动、积极建设农村人民公社的教育。据唐山、巨鹿、藁城、唐县、张北等十七个市县的统计，目前已有八十万青年学习了邢燕子的事迹。共青团保定市委，除在全市青年中宣传了邢燕子的模范事迹外，还表扬了本市三十八名大办农业、大办粮食的青年积极分子，大大鼓舞了全市青年的热情。共青团张家口市委更号召广大青年以邢燕子为榜样，在当前“三秋”工作中发挥突击作用。
    河北广大青年学了邢燕子的事迹后，纷纷表示要作一个“燕子式”的青年，发愤图强建设家园。仅唐山市就出现了一万二千多个“燕子式”的青年突击队。高阳县小陈村二百九十多名青年妇女组成的突击队，向党表示：“路在人走，事在人为，燕子能办到的，我们也一定能办到。”在厂矿和财贸等战线的青年，也立志像邢燕子那样发愤图强，增加生产，搞好工作，支援农业生产。开滦赵各庄煤矿的青年通过学习，涌现了二十四个大超产的青年集体，有一千五百多青年，创造了夺煤新成绩。唐山一位作商业工作的女青年李爱兰，初次外出调运鲜货，独自星夜步行八十多里，把货物及时运到。别人赞扬她时，她说：和邢燕子比起来，我还差得很远。我一定要当商业战线上的邢燕子！
    邢燕子红在农村，专在农村的事迹，使一些原先不安心农业生产的知识青年，受到了极大的教育。他们在学习了邢燕子的事迹后，认清农村前途似锦，大有可为，开始坚定了建设农村的信心。正定县丰家庄公社东里双生产队，有个知识青年叫秦新凤，她在高小毕业后没考上中学，又不安心在农村生产。学了邢燕子的事迹后，她说：“邢燕子给我指出了方向。我决心向邢燕子学习，在农村大干一场，为人民立功！”沧县纸房头公社刘辛庄生产队知识青年赵玉珍，去年2月从农中毕业后，就参加了农业生产。在生产中，碰到了一些困难，就有点灰心，思想上有些动摇。她在报纸上看到了邢燕子和困难作斗争的事迹后，立即给邢燕子写了一封信，表示不怕困难，不怕艰苦，决心在农村干一辈子。目前，她已经和村里的青年一块，组成了“赶燕子突击队”，决心用邢燕子改造北大洼的干劲，改造村北的大碱场。
    邢燕子热爱农业的模范事迹，也对现在城市的知识青年发生了很大影响。唐山市区的青年们学习了邢燕子的事迹后，有一万三千多人要求奔赴农业生产战线，建设农村人民公社。目前，已有五百八十三名青年组成三个青年园艺队，到郊区安家落户。
    邢燕子发愤图强、埋头苦干、大办农业的模范行动，不仅在河北广大青年中有了深刻的影响，而且开始超出河北省的范围，成为全国许多青年的学习榜样。邢燕子的事迹在报纸上发表后，许多青年给她写信，表示向她学习，并发起友谊竞赛，并肩携手建设祖国农村。全国青年社会主义建设积极分子、吉林省东盛人民公社海兰生产队队长吕根泽，从报纸上看到邢燕子的先进事迹以后，代表全队队员向燕子队挑战。挑战书中表示要更加积极投入农业生产，使海兰江两岸变成米粮川、花果山和鲜鱼湾。燕子队立即应战，要和海兰队赛建设农村人民公社的雄心壮志，赛不畏艰苦、不怕困难的革命精神，赛收的粮食多，赛大搞副业和副食品生产，赛巧干和钻研的精神，赛学习理论和文化。邢燕子和吕根泽这种相互竞赛的革命精神，激起了各地青年更广泛的反应。共青团上海市浦东县委员会为此发出通知，号召全县青年向他们学习，开展大办农业、大办粮食的革命竞赛，迅速掀起大战“三秋”的竞赛热潮。全国青年社会主义建设积极分子吕美英，已和上海市红旗青年突击手朱玉琪互下战表，展开了新手和老手之间的竞赛热潮。
