	Tran Huy Lieu, head of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation and vice-president of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, said in his report that after two years of continuous Great Leap Forward practice, it has been proved that the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune have become sharp weapons for the Chinese people of all ethnic groups to carry out economic, political, ideological, technological, and cultural revolutions. He pointed out that the Vietnamese and Chinese people are facing a common enemy—American imperialism. He said that the Chinese people cherish peace very much, have advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and advocate the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia and the Pacific.

	Congo-China Association Established
	The Congo-China Association was officially established recently in Leopoldville, capital of the Republic of the Congo. The chairman of the association is Alphonse Makwambala, and the vice-chairman is Antoine Ligobe Mandango.
	Liu Changsheng, president of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, sent a telegram to Alphonse Makwambala, chairman of the Congo-China Association, on the 1st, warmly congratulating the establishment of the Congo-China Association. The telegram condemned the crimes of imperialism headed by the United States in invading the Congo under the banner of the United Nations, and expressed firm support for the just struggle of the Congolese people!

	Federation of Nigeria Declares Independence
	The most populous African country, the Federation of Nigeria, declared its independence at zero hour on the 1st.
	In the capital, Lagos, the independence ceremony was held at the racecourse.

The huge crowd participating in the ceremony then sang the new national anthem. People then cheered and danced, celebrating to their heart's content.

	Castro Condemns U.S. Armed Aggression Conspiracy
	Cuban Prime Minister Castro once again condemned the U.S. government's preparations for armed aggression against Cuba in a television program on the morning of the 30th. He pointed out that U.S. imperialism is attempting to launch an armed invasion of Cuba by counter-revolutionary groups or instigate Guatemala or other puppet governments to carry out provocative activities against Cuba. But if it fails, it will directly invade Cuba. Castro pointed out that the U.S. government's request that American expatriates in Cuba evacuate Cuba is part of the U.S. aggression plan.
	Speaking of what he saw in the United States, Castro said that imperialism is on the downward slope of fascist history, reminiscent of Hitler's Gestapo. Castro emphasized that "the U.S. government is a government of monopoly groups" and therefore cannot help underdeveloped countries. For monopoly groups, they are interested in squeezing more profits.

	Laotian Royal Army Defeats Rebels in North Kading
	According to Agence France-Presse from Vientiane, the Laotian Royal Army, with a force of 250 men, defeated a force of 750 Nosavan rebels in a battle at North Kading village, about 50 kilometers east of North San on the 29th. The defeated troops crossed the Nam Kading River, a tributary of the Mekong River, and retreated to the Thai bank.
	According to the Associated Press, citing an announcement by the Vientiane Royal Government authorities, the Nosavan troops entrenched in Xieng Khouang have surrendered to the Royal Government troops.

	United States Intensifies Conspiracy to Intervene in Laos
	The Southeast Asia Aggression Group, manipulated by the United States, held another special meeting in Bangkok on the 29th to plot conspiracies to interfere in Laos.
	An official of the Southeast Asia Aggression Group said that the overthrow of the provincial government in Sam Neua province of Laos, controlled by the Phoumi Nosavan traitor group, is "where the real danger lies in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization region." He also revealed that the Southeast Asia Aggression Group is currently looking for excuses to take action to interfere in Laos, either by the Laotian government "requesting" it to interfere, or "having evidence of foreign infiltration or aggression."
	In order to create an excuse to interfere in Laos, U.S. State Department Acting Spokesman Francis Tully issued a statement on the 28th, falsely accusing the Laotian Fighting Forces of "doing everything possible to undermine Laos's opportunity to achieve peace, extinguish Laos's desire for neutrality, and prevent the realization of national harmony and unity in Laos."

	Japanese Million Public Servants Launch Autumn Struggle
	One million national public servants in Japan launched a massive second nationwide unified action of the autumn struggle in 600 locations across the country on the 30th. Japanese public servants, who have been deprived of the right to strike by the government, held workplace rallies and demonstrations, resolutely demanding a wage increase of 3,000 yen per person from April this year, abolishing the "performance appraisal" system that restricts the freedom of teachers, guaranteeing workers' rights, and opposing the illegal suppression of workers.
	In order to realize the workers' demands, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which has 3.7 million members, decided on the 29th to hold the third nationwide unified action of the autumn struggle from October 8th to 15th.
