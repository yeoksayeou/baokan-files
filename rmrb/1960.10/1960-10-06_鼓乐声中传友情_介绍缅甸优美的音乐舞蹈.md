    Friendship Conveyed in Drum Music
    ——Introducing the Beautiful Music and Dance of Burma

    The Burmese Cultural Delegation is currently in our country for a friendly performance tour. This delegation has once again brought the beautiful music and dance of Burma to the Chinese people, allowing them to once again appreciate the wonderful musical and dance arts of our southwestern neighbor.
    Burma is a country with a long history, and the Burmese people are a nation of singing and dancing. Whether in cities or villages, one can see the healthy and beautiful dance postures of young men and women everywhere. These dances bring people into a poetic realm of yearning for a happy life and loving peace. These dances also embody the spiritual outlook of the various ethnic groups in Burma.
    During my time living in Burma, I watched Burmese dances many times, and each time left me with unforgettable impressions. Its characteristics are graceful dance postures, a combination of strength and softness, lightness and comfort; the arms, legs, body, eyes, and neck are closely coordinated, and special attention is paid to the beat of the music. The rhythm of the dance is clear, and the performance is delicate, with attention to hand gestures, eye expressions, body movements... similar to the strict training of hand, eye, body, and footwork in Chinese Peking Opera.
    Burmese dance usually uses drums as props. The "Long Drum Dance" is one of the most popular and excellent dances in Burmese folklore. This dance is performed on festive or wedding occasions. Only two people participate in the dance; one person strikes a long drum shaped like an ancient vase with their palms, elbows, knees, and feet, and makes various lively and graceful movements; the other person strikes a pair of cymbals tied with colorful tassels, echoing each other, with a brisk rhythm, giving a feeling of lightness and gaiety.
    Burmese music is also very beautiful. The moving melodies, harmonious tones, and clear rhythms are both lyrical and poetic, and burst forth with infinite enthusiasm. From Burmese dramas, we can also see another form of music, namely opera music. On the stage are various instruments suitable for any acoustic performance. If a scene of sailing at sea appears on the stage, then the tune and rhythm of the music convey the artistic conception of surging sea waves and sailors operating at sea. Music expressing various sounds and movements has certain tunes, such as war music, dirges, sleep tunes, flying tunes, king tunes, and general tunes.
    The Burmese people love music and dance, and the development of Burmese music and dance has reached a considerably high level. After Burma gained independence in 1948, the Burmese Federal Government and the people worked hard to revive their own music and dance. In the field of classical music, for example, eighty-one classical songs have been handed over to famous Burmese artists for sorting out, and the songs, interludes, string tones, and rhythms have been uniformly incorporated into a regular format, and songs that meet the standards have been set to music. Burmese artists are further studying how to inherit the heritage of their national music and dance and absorb the essence of excellent foreign music and dance to enrich and create their own music and dance.
    Cultural exchanges between China and Burma are not only long-standing but also very extensive. As early as 120 AD (the first year of Yongning during the reign of Emperor An of the Han Dynasty), the Shan State King Yongyoutiao of ancient Burma sent an art troupe to cross the mountains and ridges and come to Luoyang, the capital of China at that time, to perform exquisite artistic performances. The art troupe was warmly received by the Chinese government at that time and warmly praised by the Chinese people, and it was recorded in Chinese history as a major historical event. Although the friendship and cultural exchanges between China and Burma are so long-standing, the comprehensive development of this friendship and exchange has only occurred after the Chinese people were liberated and Burma gained independence.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the independence of Burma, the friendly relations and cultural exchanges between the two countries have been further developed. Not long ago, the Burmese Federal Cultural and Friendship Art Delegation led by head Wu Basheng just visited China; now, accompanying Prime Minister U Nu to China for a friendly visit is a stronger and larger cultural delegation, which is also the largest cultural delegation that Burma has sent abroad in history. There are many outstanding artists among the members of the delegation, such as dancer Du Lala, film actor Wu Tunwei, who has won the Golden Statue Award for Best Actor twice, and film actress Qin Youmei. There are also many young Burmese artists. The performances include movies, dance dramas, music and dance, including the most popular modern and classical songs and dances in Burma, as well as the music and dances of the Shan, Kachin, and Jingpo ethnic groups. These programs all have a high degree of artistic skill and unique national style, and some also have new ideological content. For example, the "Farming Dance" vividly expresses the Burmese working people's love for labor and their hardworking and simple character.
    Contemporary Burmese artists have brought to the Chinese people the deep friendship of the Burmese people for the Chinese people. In their program, there is a "Song of Sino-Burmese Friendship," which enthusiastically praises the kinship-like friendship between the people of China and Burma and sings the common wishes of the people of the two countries. The last few lines of the lyrics say:
    The friendship between China and Burma is like the water of the Nu River and the Salween River, harmonious and long-lasting!
    Yes, the friendship between the people of China and Burma will forever be like the surging rivers, flowing endlessly. This is the beautiful wish of the Burmese people, and also the beautiful wish of the Chinese people.

    鼓乐声中传友情
    ——介绍缅甸优美的音乐舞蹈
    解力夫
    缅甸文化代表团正在我国进行友好的访问演出。这个代表团又一次为中国人民带来了缅甸优美的音乐和歌舞，使中国人民能够又一次欣赏我们西南邻邦的美妙的音乐和歌舞艺术。
    缅甸是一个历史悠久的国家，缅甸的民族又是载歌载舞的民族。无论在城市和农村，到处可以看到青年男女的健美舞姿。这些舞蹈把人民带进了向往幸福生活、热爱和平的诗境。这些舞蹈也体现了缅甸各民族的精神面貌。
    在缅甸生活期间，我曾多次观看过缅甸的舞蹈，每次都给我留下了难忘的印象。它的特点是，舞姿优美，动作坚柔并蓄，轻快舒畅；手臂、腿部、身段、眼睛、颈部配合得非常紧密，特别是音乐的配合很讲究板眼。舞蹈的节奏鲜明，表演细腻，在手势、眼神、身段……各方面的讲究，类似我国京戏中对手、眼、身法、步的严格训练。
    缅甸的舞蹈，通常以鼓作为道具。“长鼓舞”是缅甸民间最流行、最优秀的舞蹈之一。在节日或婚庆喜事的场合，都有这种舞蹈表演。参加跳舞的只有两人，一人以掌、肘、膝、足击着像古花瓶一样的长鼓，并且做出各种活泼、优美的身段；另一人击着系有彩穗的双铙，互相应和，节奏轻捷，给人一种轻松明快的感觉。
    缅甸的音乐也很优美，那动人的旋律、和谐的音调和鲜明的节奏，既带有抒情的诗意，又迸发出无限的热情。从缅甸的戏剧中，我们还可以看到另外一种音乐形式，就是戏曲音乐。在舞台上布置着适合任何音响表演的各种乐器。如果舞台上出现一幕航海的场面，那末音乐的调子和节拍就传出海涛汹涌和水手在海上操作的意境。表现各种音响和动作的音乐有一定的调子，如战乐、悲歌、睡眠调、飞翔调、君王调和将相调等。
    缅甸人民爱好音乐和舞蹈，缅甸音乐和舞蹈的发展已有相当高的水平。1948年缅甸取得独立后，缅甸联邦政府和人民努力复兴自己的音乐和舞蹈，如古典音乐方面，已将八十一个古典歌曲交给缅甸著名艺术家整理，将歌曲、插曲、弦音和节奏等统一纳入正规格式，合乎标准的歌子都已谱成曲调。缅甸艺术家们还在进一步研究如何继承自己民族的音乐舞蹈方面的遗产和吸取外国优秀音乐舞蹈的精华，来丰富和创造自己的音乐和舞蹈。
    中国和缅甸的文化交往，不仅历史悠久，而且非常广泛。早在公元一百二十年（汉安帝永宁元年），古缅甸的掸邦国王雍由调就派遣过艺术团越过丛山峻岭，来到当时中国的首都洛阳作了精湛的艺术表演。这个艺术团受到了当时的中国政府亲切的招待和中国人民热烈的称颂，并且当作一个重大的历史事件载入中国的史册。中缅友好和文化交流虽然如此悠久，但是这种友谊和交流的全面发展，则是在中国人民获得解放和缅甸独立以后的事情。
    自从中华人民共和国成立和缅甸获得独立以后，两国的友好关系和文化交流得到了进一步的发展。不久前，由吴巴盛团长率领的缅甸联邦文化友好艺术代表团刚刚访问过中国；现在随吴努总理到中国来进行友好访问的，是一个阵容更坚强、规模更宏大的文化代表团，也是缅甸历史上派到国外的最大的文化代表团。代表团成员中有很多杰出的艺术家，如表演单人舞的杜拉拉、曾两次获得最佳演员金像奖的电影演员吴吞威和电影女明星钦友梅等。还有很多年青的缅甸艺术家。演出的节目有电影、舞剧、音乐和舞蹈，包括缅甸最受欢迎的现代和古典的歌舞，以及掸族、克钦族、景颇族的音乐和舞蹈。这些节目都具有高度的艺术技巧和独特的民族风格，有些还具有新的思想内容。例如：“农作舞”鲜明地表现了缅甸劳动人民热爱劳动和勤劳朴实的性格。
    当代缅甸的艺术家们为中国人民带来了缅甸人民对中国人民深厚的友谊。在他们的节目中，有一首“中缅友谊之歌”，这首歌热情地颂扬了中缅两国人民的亲戚般的友谊，唱出了两国人民共同的心愿，歌词的最后几句说：
    中缅友谊就像怒江、萨尔温江的水，和谐融洽，绵延久长！
    是的，中缅两国人民的友情，将永远如滔滔江河，川流不息。这是缅甸人民的美好的祝愿，也是中国人民的美好的祝愿。
