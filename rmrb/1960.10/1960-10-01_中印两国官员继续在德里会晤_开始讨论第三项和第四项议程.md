Xinhua News Agency, 29th: To fulfill the instructions contained in the joint communiqué issued after the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India, officials from the Chinese and Indian governments have been meeting in Delhi since August 19th, following discussions in Beijing. The officials have completed the exploration of documents related to their second agenda item, namely "Treaties and Agreements; Tradition and Custom". Since last week, they have been engaged in their third and fourth agenda items, namely "Administration and Jurisdiction" and "Other".

The joint communiqué stipulated that the officials should complete this task by the end of September and submit reports to both governments. There is still some work to be done, and despite the determined efforts of both groups of officials, it may not be possible to complete it by the end of the month. Following a joint request from the heads of both groups, the two Prime Ministers agreed that, in order to complete the work, the originally stipulated deadline could be extended slightly as needed. The officials of the two countries are continuing to meet in Delhi and hope to complete the substantive work of reviewing the remaining documents in early October.

The two Prime Ministers also agreed that after the two groups of officials have completed the substantive review of the various agenda items, they may adjourn for a short period and then reconvene for a third and final meeting to complete their report. The time and place of the third meeting will be determined by the two governments through consultation.

    中印两国官员继续在德里会晤
    开始讨论第三项和第四项议程
    新华社29日讯　为了完成两国总理会晤后发表的联合公报中所包含的指示，中印两国政府官员，继在北京的讨论之后，从8月19日起在德里进行会晤。官员们已经完成了对他们的第二项议程，即“条约和协定；传统和习惯”的证件的探讨。从上星期开始，他们已在进行他们的第三和第四项议程，即“行政和管辖”和“其他”。
    联合公报预定官员们应在9月底以前完成这项任务并向两国政府提出报告。现在仍然有一些工作要作，尽管两国官员小组都作了坚决的努力，但在月底以前可能还无法完成。经过两国小组组长的共同请求，两国总理同意，为了完成工作，可视需要稍许延长原来规定的期限。两国官员正在德里继续进行会晤，并且希望在10月初完成有关审查剩余证件的实质性工作。
    两国总理也同意，两国官员小组在完成了关于各项议程的实质性审查工作以后，可以休会一个短时期，然后复会，举行第三次也就是最后的一次会议，以完成他们的报告，第三次会议的时间和地点，将由两国政府商定。
