The Second National Workers' Amateur Art Exhibition was exciting to see and I must talk about it.

    **Strong Revolutionary Spirit**
    This workers' art exhibition once again demonstrates that workers' art has a strong revolutionary spirit; it is always serving the socialist revolution and construction with full political enthusiasm. This spirit is not only reflected in the choice of creative themes, but also in the handling of the themes.
    Worker comrades use keen political senses and strong colors to depict major events in the political life of our people, and to sing praises of the arduous struggles and brilliant achievements on all fronts. The most impressive exhibits are: how the people responded to the Party's call to vigorously develop agriculture and steel production, and the spirit of working hard and striving for self-reliance. Examples are the propaganda painting "Morning" (Cao Genglin, Wuhan Iron and Steel), "Dedicate Youth to Agriculture" (Zhang Duanyuan, Jilin), the Chinese painting "Seizing Steel" (Du Jiaqin and Lu Yifei, Shanghai), and the print "Stoker" (Yan Hongyi, Shanxi). These works reflect the pulse of the times, become the strongest voice in the exhibits, and give people a strong spiritual infection.
    Of course, this infection cannot be said to come only from the subject matter itself, but also from the artist's artistic treatment. The characteristic of worker comrades in handling subject matter is that they pay great attention to highlighting the theme of the work and portraying the spiritual outlook of the characters. The reason why "Morning" is so infectious is that the author emphasized the heroic spirit of the characters, so when you see the bugler with his cheeks puffed out and full of fighting spirit, you can't help but feel energetic. This revolutionary creative spirit of combining political effect with beautiful artistic form in the selection and treatment of subject matter is well worth learning.

    **Rapid Improvement of Artistic Level**
    This workers' art exhibition also shows that the development of workers' art has entered a new stage: it serves political production in more diverse forms and with higher skills. People are surprised: I didn't expect the workers' artistic level to improve so quickly, and they can suddenly draw such good Chinese paintings, oil paintings, and even create large-scale sculptures. Indeed, if in the past they mostly drew cartoons, now they can draw any kind of painting (there are more than a dozen kinds of paintings on display); if the skills were still immature in the past, now they are much higher and more skilled. For example, the Chinese painting "Female Welder" (Wang Junsheng and Tao Jiayuan, Hebei), the print "Attacking the Soil to Build the Petroleum City" (Cai Qingyao, Guangdong), and the propaganda painting "Hold High the Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Advance Bravely" (Liu Wenquan, Shandong), as well as many cartoons, comic strips, and paper-cuts are like this. Their ideological level and artistic level have been significantly improved. It is not easy to draw people with a brush on rice paper, and the strokes cannot be changed, but now the workers draw so well; the accuracy of the shape, the vividness of the spirit, and the skill of the brush and ink have achieved good results. Even some print works are hard to believe that they are from the hands of amateur worker authors. Moreover, what is even more valuable is that the improvement of workers' creative skills is closely linked to the requirements of expressing the ideological content of the works, and the unity of politics and art is always sought under the principle of adhering to the political standard first. This is an important reason why workers' art creation can maintain and rapidly improve its combat effectiveness. It is also another aspect that is well worth learning from.

    **Unlimited Brilliant Prospects**
    We are happy for the rapid expansion of the workers' art team. Many of the old authors who participated in this exhibition have greatly improved, such as Zheng Tongxiao, Lu Yifei, Yang Shu, Cai Chansheng, and Ma Jingjia, who participated in the first workers' amateur art creation exhibition in 1955. What is even more gratifying is the emergence of many talented new authors. In the exhibits, you can find many poetic new works that attract attention and please people in various aspects, such as "Female Electric Locomotive Driver" (Huang Chuanbao, Guangxi), "Production is a Master, Raising Pigs is a Model" (Zhang Yuan, Beijing), and "Passing on Experience" (Xu Fusheng, Liaoning). These works all have the characteristics of workers' art first—strong political content, grand style, sufficient spirit, and a strong atmosphere of life. This gives us a sign of an infinitely bright and victorious prospect. We firmly believe that due to the growing strength of the workers' art new force, my country's socialist art will radiate even more brilliant light.

    工人美术新军日益壮大
    华夏
    看了第二届工人业余美术创作展览会，很兴奋，非谈谈不可。
    强烈的革命精神
    这次工人美展再一次表明，工人美术具有强烈的革命精神；它总是不断地以饱满的政治热情，为社会主义革命和建设服务。这精神不仅表现在创作题材的选择上，同时表现在题材的处理上。
    工人同志以敏锐的政治嗅觉和强烈的色调来描绘我国人民政治生活中的重大事件，歌颂各个战线上的艰巨斗争和辉煌成就。展品给人印象最深的是：人民如何响应党的号召，开展大办农业，大办钢铁的火热斗争，以及如何发愤图强，艰苦奋斗的精神面貌。像宣传画《晨》（武钢曹更林）、《把青春献给农业》（吉林张端元）、中国画《夺钢》（上海杜家勤、陆一飞）、版画《司炉工》（山西阎红艺）等都是。这些作品反映着时代的脉搏，成为展品中的最强音，给人在精神上以有力的感染。
    当然，这感染不能说只来自题材本身，还在于作者的艺术处理。工人同志在处理题材上的特色，就是非常注意作品的主题思想的突出和人物精神面貌的刻划。《晨》之所以感染力强，就由于作者着重强调了人物的那种意气风发的豪迈气概，所以当你看到那腮帮子鼓得圆圆的斗志昂扬的吹号手的时候，就不由得不自己也浑身是劲起来。这种无论在选择和处理题材时处处把政治效果与美好的艺术形式结合起来的革命的创作精神，是非常值得学习的。
    艺术水平迅速提高
    这次工人美展还表明，工人美术的发展已进入这样一个新阶段：它是以更多样的形式和更高的技巧来为政治生产服务了。人们惊讶：没想到工人的艺术水平提高得这样快，一下子就可以画出这样好的中国画、油画，甚而搞出大型的雕塑来了。的确，如果说过去他们较多的是画漫画，而现在是什么画都能画了（展出的画种有十余种之多）；如果说过去的技巧还幼稚，而现在就高得多了，熟练得多了。比如中国画《女电焊工》（河北王俊生、陶家元），版画《攻土建设石油城》（广东蔡清耀）和宣传画《高举毛泽东思想红旗奋勇前进》（山东刘文泉）以及许多漫画、连环画和剪纸等就是这样。它们的思想水平和艺术水平都有显著提高。用毛笔在宣纸上画人，下笔不能改，可不容易，然而现在工人却画得那样好；形的准确，神的生动和笔墨工夫，都取得了很好的成绩。甚至有的版画作品竟使人难以相信是出自工人业余作者之手。而且更可贵的是工人的创作技巧的提高，始终与表达作品的思想内容的要求紧紧联在一起，始终在坚持政治标准第一的原则下求得政治与艺术的统一，这是工人美术创作之所以能够保持并迅速提高其战斗力的重要原因。也是非常值得借鉴的又一个方面。
    无限光辉的前景
    我们为工人美术队伍的迅速扩大而高兴。参加这次展出的有不少老作者，参加过1955年第一届工人业余美术创作展览会的郑通校、陆一飞、杨树、蔡蟾升和马景甲等同志的作品都有很大的提高，更叫人高兴的是许许多多有才华的新作者的涌现。在展品中，你可以发现许多富有诗意、从各个方面来引人注意讨人喜欢的新人之作，如《女电机车司机》（广西黄传宝），《生产是能手，养猪是模范》（北京张源）和《传经》（辽宁徐馥盛）等就是。这些作品都首先具有工人美术的特色——政治性强、气魄大、神气足、生活气氛浓厚。这就给我们预示着一个无限美好的胜利前景。我们坚信，由于工人美术新军的日益壮大，我国社会主义美术事业必将放射出更加灿烂的光辉。
