    Welcoming Relatives from the Heroic Homeland
    – A Record of the Visit of the Korean People's Army Ensemble to the Hongxing China-Korea Friendship People's Commune

    This morning, when the autumn morning mist had not yet dissipated and dewdrops still clung to the willow trees, members of the Hongxing China-Korea Friendship People's Commune gathered from all directions on the tree-lined avenue to welcome their Korean relatives from the heroic homeland.

    At 9:05 a.m., Major General Jang Seo-hwan, head of the Korean People's Army Ensemble, Lieutenant Colonel Kim Byung-soon, deputy head, and some members of the ensemble, accompanied by Major General Wei Chuantong, vice president of the China-Korea Friendship Association, arrived at the Hongxing China-Korea Friendship People's Commune. At this moment, the crowd cheered, gongs and drums sounded, and firecrackers went off. Commune cadres enthusiastically stepped forward to greet them, and members of the commune warmly applauded. Former volunteer soldiers in the commune greeted their comrades with a sense of reunion after a long separation, and children from nurseries and kindergartens ran over with laughter to greet their Korean uncles. Their arrival brought the profound friendship of the Korean people and the People's Army to the commune, and brought greetings and salutations from the members of the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Sunan County, South Pyongan Province, Korea.

    Major General Jang Seo-hwan, head of the Korean People's Army Ensemble, and other distinguished guests waved to the commune members while talking with the commune cadres as they walked. When General Jang Seo-hwan saw a group of children swarming forward, he picked up the child who ran to the front.

    In the commune's reception room, long tables were filled with the commune's own produce: plates of rose grapes, plates of Ya pears, and plates of fried sweet potato slices. On the four walls of the reception room hung silk banners presented by the Korean people, and blooming chrysanthemums adorned both ends of the long tables. Here, the guests and hosts spoke freely of their friendship.

    Guo Fang, secretary of the commune's Party committee, reported to the relatives on the commune's scale, production, and the income of its members. He mentioned that the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean people had blossomed and borne fruit here - the rice seeds sent by the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative this spring had yielded a bountiful harvest under the careful cultivation of the commune members; the apple saplings given by the Korean people had grown strong and sturdy.

    The guests and hosts talked about the profound friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, becoming more and more excited as they talked! Major General Jang Seo-hwan said to Su Zhen, Li Juchuan, and Pan Caigen, former volunteer soldiers in the commune, "You can see comrades who were former volunteer soldiers everywhere in China. Seeing you here makes me feel especially close."

    At this time, Major General Wei Chuantong, vice president of the China-Korea Friendship Association, recalled his visit to Korea around this time last year. He said that he had received a warm reception in Korea; the affection with which the Korean *amanis* inquired about the volunteer soldiers deeply moved him. Major General Wei Chuantong said, "Maintaining regular contact between the Chinese and Korean people will further consolidate and develop the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people."

    Next, Major General Jang Seo-hwan said that through this visit, we have gained a deeper understanding of the tremendous achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, holding high the three red banners. He said, "The achievements of the Red Star China-Korea Friendship People's Commune reflect the achievements of all the people's communes in China. The Chinese people can only achieve such accomplishments under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao."

    In a warm atmosphere, General Jang Seo-hwan placed the "China-Korea Friendship Medal" on the chest of Guo Fang, secretary of the commune's Party committee. He also presented gifts to the commune on behalf of the Korean People's Army Ensemble. At this moment, commune members brought over large winter melons and large sweet potatoes produced by the commune as gifts for the distinguished guests. Major General Jang Seo-hwan looked at a winter melon weighing forty-nine *jin* with great interest, and personally picked up three sweet potatoes growing on one vine, weighing twelve *jin*, and weighed them, saying, "Without the commune fully unleashing the enthusiasm of the farmers, such large sweet potatoes could not be produced."

    Accompanied by commune cadres, the distinguished guests visited the commune's agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing plant. In front of an electric saw made by the workers themselves, General Jang Seo-hwan stopped and watched the workers' skilled operation with great interest. He shook hands with workers Wang Tianfu and Yuan Qiulan, asking them about their work. Major General Jang Seo-hwan praised at this time, "If you didn't liberate your thinking, you wouldn't be able to make this machine yourself."

    Near noon, the distinguished guests traveled by car through the flat, tree-lined avenue and arrived at the commune's horse farm, pig farm, and dairy farm, seeing tall, sturdy horses that could pull four or five tons of cargo at a time, large, fat pigs each weighing over seven hundred *jin*, and herds of fat dairy cows. Wherever they went, they received a warm welcome from the commune members.

    Finally, the distinguished guests arrived at the threshing ground. Piles of golden rice attracted everyone's attention. General Jang Seo-hwan and others came to a neatly arranged pile of rice ears, and Yuan Yanyong, deputy director of the commune, introduced to him: "These are the fruits of the rice seeds sent by the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative this spring." General Jang Seo-hwan asked: "Does the growth of Korean seeds here suffer from the limitations of soil and climate?" A production team leader from the commune replied: "It is not restricted. Every grain is full, with one hundred and twenty to one hundred and fifty grains per ear; yielding more than one thousand *jin* per *mu*." The production team leader also said, "After the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative sent us these rice seeds from thousands of miles away, the commune members were greatly encouraged. In order to cultivate these seeds of friendship well on Chinese soil, we plowed and tilled carefully, weeded four times, and never let the rice fields lack water." The distinguished guests also carefully watched the commune members' mechanical threshing operations on the threshing ground.

    As the distinguished guests bid farewell to the commune cadres and members, Guo Fang, secretary of the commune's Party committee, handed a bouquet of fruitful rice grown from the rice seeds given by the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative to Major General Jang Seo-hwan, asking him to take it to the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative and convey the gratitude and greetings of all the members of the Hongxing China-Korea Friendship People's Commune. General Jang Seo-hwan said, "This is the fruit symbolizing the friendship and unity of the Chinese and Korean people, and we will definitely bring it to the Korean people."

    欢迎来自英雄国土的亲人
    ——记朝鲜人民军协奏团参观访问红星中朝友好人民公社
    新华社记者　周长宗　宁焕明　程鹏
    今天早上，当秋日的晨雾未散、柳树上还挂着滴滴露珠的时候，红星中朝友好人民公社的社员们，从四面八方汇集到林荫大道上来，迎接来自英雄国土的朝鲜亲人。
    九点零五分，朝鲜人民军协奏团团长张瑞焕少将、副团长金炳淳中校和部分团员，在中朝友好协会副会长魏传统少将陪同下，来到了红星中朝友好人民公社。这时，人群欢腾，锣鼓、鞭炮齐鸣。公社干部们热情地迎上前去，夹道欢迎的社员们热烈鼓掌，在公社里的前志愿军人员怀着久别重逢的心情来迎接战友，托儿所、幼儿园的孩子们也欢笑着跑来迎接朝鲜伯伯。迎接他们给公社带来了朝鲜人民和人民军的深情厚谊，迎接他们给公社带来了朝鲜平安南道顺安郡朝中友谊农业社社员的祝贺和问候。
    朝鲜人民军协奏团团长张瑞焕将军等贵宾，一面向社员招手致意，一面和公社干部们边走边谈。当张瑞焕将军看到一群孩子们拥上前来的时候，他把跑到最前面的一个孩子抱了起来。
    在公社的会客厅里，长长的条桌上摆满了公社自己生产的东西：一盘盘的玫瑰葡萄，一盘盘的鸭梨和一盘盘的油煎红薯干。会客厅的四壁上，挂着一面面朝鲜人民赠送的锦旗，长桌两端摆着盛开的秋菊。宾主在这里，畅述友情。
    公社党委书记郭方，向亲人们汇报了公社的规模、生产和社员收入的情况。他谈到，中朝两国人民的深厚友谊，已在他们这里开花结果——朝中友谊农业社今春寄来的稻种，在公社社员的精心培植下，已经累累丰收；朝鲜人民赠给的苹果树苗，已经成长茁壮。
    宾主们畅叙着中朝两国人民深厚友谊，越谈越兴奋！张瑞焕少将对公社里前志愿军人员诉真、李巨川、潘财根说：“在中国到处能看到前志愿军的同志。我在这里看到你们，特别感到亲切。”
    这时，中朝友好协会副会长魏传统少将回忆起去年这个时候，他在朝鲜访问时的情形。他说，他在朝鲜受到了热情的招待；朝鲜的阿妈妮问起志愿军，那种关怀的心情，使他深深感动。魏传统少将说：“中朝两国人民保持经常的联系，使中朝两国人民的友谊更加巩固和发展。”
    接着，张瑞焕少将说，经过这次访问，我们对于中国人民在中国共产党领导下，高举三面红旗取得的巨大成就，有了更深刻的了解。他说：“从红星中朝友好人民公社所取得的成就中，也可以看出中国所有人民公社的成就。中国人民只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，才能达到这样的成就。”
    在热烈气氛中，张瑞焕将军将“朝中友谊纪念章”给公社党委书记郭方戴在胸前。他并代表朝鲜人民军协奏团向公社赠送了礼品。这时，公社社员们抬来了社里生产的大冬瓜和大红薯，作为礼品赠给贵宾。张瑞焕少将很感兴趣地看着一个重达四十九斤的冬瓜，又亲手拿起三块长在一棵蔓上、重达十二斤的红薯掂了掂说：“没有公社充分发挥了农民的积极性，是生产不出这样大的红薯来的。”
    贵宾们在公社干部陪同下，参观了公社的农业机械修造厂。在一台工人自己制造的电锯前边，张瑞焕将军停步下来，很感兴趣地看了工人熟练的操作。他和工人王天福、袁秋兰等一一握手，亲切地问他们工作情况。张瑞焕少将这时称赞地说：“这台机器，如果不解放思想，你们便不能自己制造出来。”
    将近中午时分，贵宾们乘车穿过平坦的林荫大道，先后到了公社的养马场、养猪场和奶牛场，看了一次能拉四、五吨重货物的高大骏马，只只达到七百斤以上的大肥猪，和成群的肥大奶牛。他们走到那里，都受到社员们的热烈欢迎。
    最后，贵宾们来到打谷场。一堆堆金黄色的稻谷吸引着大家。张瑞焕将军等来到一片摆得很整齐的稻谷穗前，公社副主任袁言庸向他介绍说：“这是朝中友谊农业社今春寄来的稻种结成的果实。”张瑞焕将军问道：“朝鲜种子在这里成长，受不受土质和气候的限制？”公社的一个生产队长回答说：“不受限制，颗颗子粒饱满，每穗有一百二十至一百五十粒；每亩收一千多斤。”这位生产队长还说，“朝中友谊农业社将这稻谷种子千里迢迢寄给我们后，社员们受到很大鼓舞。为了把这友谊的种子，在中国土地上培育好，深耕细作，锄草四遍，从来没让稻田里缺过水。”贵宾们还在打谷场上，仔细观看了社员们机械脱谷操作。
    在贵宾们向公社干部和社员们告别的时候，公社党委书记郭方把一束由朝中友谊农业社赠送的稻种长成的丰硕稻谷，交给张瑞焕少将，请他带给朝中友谊农业社，并转达红星中朝友好人民公社全体社员们的谢意和问候。张瑞焕将军说：“这是象征着朝中两国人民的友谊和团结的果实，我们一定把它带给朝鲜人民。”
