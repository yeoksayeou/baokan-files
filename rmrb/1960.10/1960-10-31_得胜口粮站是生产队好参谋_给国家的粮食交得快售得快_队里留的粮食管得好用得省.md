Deshengkou Grain Station is a Good Advisor to the Production Team
Delivering Grain to the State Quickly and Selling it Quickly, Managing the Team's Grain Well and Using it Economically
Their In-depth Work and Hard Work Have Yielded Fruitful Results:
According to Tianjin Daily news: Cadres of the Deshengkou Grain Station of the Matou Commune in Wuqing County, Tianjin, go to the front lines of production to help production teams harvest, manage, and use grain well, arrange life, and run canteens well, ensuring that every team and canteen has surplus grain.

Under the leadership of the commune Party committee, cadres of the Deshengkou Grain Station began to fully assist production teams in managing canteens last summer. In April of this year, they collaborated with the shops, banks, and financial departments to jointly send cadres to be stationed permanently in production teams to participate in production and organizational life. The stationed cadres served as grain administrators and canteen cooks and managers of the production teams, assisting the production teams in doing a good and solid job in everything from grain sowing, harvesting, threshing, and storage to canteen consumption, and from completing state procurement tasks to arranging grain consumption of the production teams.

Deep into the Fields, Ascertaining Yields
Stationed cadres are on the front lines of production, helping production teams to greatly develop grain production and harvest grain well. They participate in the formulation of production plans, going deep into the fields from the very beginning of sowing, helping to check water sources, check idle land, and check disasters, expand planting areas, help production teams strengthen field management, and promptly summarize and promote advanced experiences. At the same time, they also establish production files, achieving "eight knowledges": knowing the crop types, crop acreage, sowing date, fertilization quantity, contracting situation, harvest date, estimated yield, and whether there are disasters, fundamentally changing the past phenomenon of "waiting for grain to come to the door" and being ignorant. At the time of grain harvest, under the unified leadership of the management area Party organization, they formed a yield assessment team together with production team cadres and veteran farmers, adopting the "four combinations" method of large-scale observation, small team self-assessment, team-to-team joint assessment, and actual measurement, verifying the yield team by team and plot by plot, and reasonably formulating the allocation plan for public grain, purchased grain, seed, food grain, and feed grain.

In order to harvest well and quickly, the stationed cadres also helped the production team implement the "four unified" system of unified harvesting, unified threshing and drying, unified weighing, and unified storage, and helped arrange labor, participate in and organize professional teams for autumn harvesting, transportation, threshing, and wheat planting, achieving simultaneous harvesting, threshing, purchasing, transfer, and distribution.

Sound Systems, Managing and Protecting Grain
In order to facilitate overall planning, manage grain well, and arrange life well, the stationed cadres helped the production team change the past situation of decentralized grain management, implement grain return to the team, with the production team uniformly receiving and disbursing grain, and uniformly managing and using grain. And they helped the production team establish and improve the warehouse management system, implementing "four warehouse separate storage" for food grain, seed, feed, and reserve grain, with dedicated grain for dedicated use, dedicated warehouse management, and dedicated personnel responsible. Each warehouse has a dedicated account record, and grain in and out is subject to strict approval procedures, ensuring that there is grain for receipts and evidence for payments. In this way, it is not only convenient for unified arrangement of grain, doing a good job in collective life, and doing a good job in production, but also conducive to the completion of the state's purchase and sale plan.

Under the leadership of the Party committee, the stationed cadres also organized members to visit warehouses, helping members understand the benefits of grain returning to the team. At the same time, through warehouse keeper experience exchange meetings, advanced experiences were exchanged, grain loving and grain protecting education was carried out, and grain station cadres taught storage techniques to help them improve their storage level, establish and improve temperature measurement and testing, cleaning and hygiene, inventory and other systems, so that team by team, warehouse by warehouse gradually achieved "seven nos" (no mold, no insects, no mice, no sparrows, no accidents, no discoloration, no odor).

Looking Ahead and Behind, Planning Grain Use
Stationed cadres adopted the method of "contracting canteens" to go to public canteens to serve as cooks and managers, helping to plan grain use and serving as assistants to the Party committee's organizational life. After the grain was harvested, the stationed cadres helped the production team to plan grain use from the top of the pile. They once promptly reported to the Party branch that some members had the idea of "eat first, think later" and did not pay attention to planned grain use. The Party branch immediately organized members to discuss: should we be diligent and thrifty when we have a bumper harvest? Save at the top of the pile or save at the bottom of the pile? When we were hit by disaster, fraternal regions supported us, should we support the disaster areas when we have a good harvest? Through recollection and comparison, the ideological understanding was unified, greatly encouraging the revolutionary spirit of the masses to work hard and struggle hard. They unanimously proposed to proceed from the overall situation, save food and clothing themselves, and save grain to support the people in the disaster areas and support national construction. On this basis, the stationed cadres, according to the instructions of the Party committee, helped the production team formulate a plan for grain use throughout the year and a plan for selling surplus grain, based on the spirit of "looking ahead and behind, making up for deficiencies with abundance, using a small stream steadily, and leaving reserves."

Developing the "Family Fortune," Managing the Canteen Well
Stationed cadres also helped canteens to vigorously develop "family fortune" production. Stationed cadres and members planted vegetables, raised pigs, raised chickens, and raised fish together, developing various non-staple food production. This year, each team planted more than 2,700 mu of vegetables, three times more than last year; raised more than 600 pigs, raised 2 million fish; and planted more than 100 mu of lotus roots. Some canteens also planted oil crops and made their own soy sauce, sesame paste and other non-staple foods.

They also helped the canteen improve its management, implement democratic management, and establish a management system of "three participations," "three publicities," and "three communications." "Three participations" means that stationed cadres, cooks, and members jointly participate in the management of the canteen. "Three publicities" means that accounts are made public to members, "family fortune" is made public, and the handling of members' suggestions is made public to members. "Three communications" means that the appointment and removal of canteen accountants, custodians, and cooks are all discussed by members; various savings plans are formulated by members; and "family fortune" production is decided by members through discussion. In addition, they also helped canteens train cooks and managers, improve their operating skills, improve cooking methods, and often change the variety of meals, so that members could eat economically and well. The members praised: "The stationed cadres are really good assistants to the Party and good housekeepers for us."

Under the leadership of the Party committee, the stationed cadres relied on the masses to help arrange the lives of the members and run the canteen well, which not only greatly boosted the enthusiasm of the members and promoted the development of production, but also enabled the grain station to excellently complete the tasks of requisition, transfer, processing, and storage. During the summer wheat harvest, each team in the entire management area overfulfilled the summer grain requisition task in only nine hours; at the beginning of the autumn harvest, the progress of harvesting and storage was also faster than in other regions.

    得胜口粮站是生产队好参谋
    给国家的粮食交得快售得快  队里留的粮食管得好用得省
    他们的深入的工作和辛勤的劳动结下丰硕的果实：
    据天津日报消息　天津市武清县码头公社得胜口粮站干部，到生产第一线，帮助生产队收好、管好、用好粮食，安排生活，办好食堂，做到队队堂堂有余粮。
    得胜口粮站干部在公社党委的领导下，去年夏季开始全力帮助生产队管好食堂；今年4月，又和商店、银行、财政部门协作，共同派干部常驻生产队，参与生产，参与组织生活。驻队干部当了生产队的粮食管理员和食堂炊事员、管理员，从粮食播种、收打入库到食堂吃用，从完成国家征购任务到安排生产队的粮食消费，都帮助生产队做得井井有条，切切实实。
    深入田间，摸清产量
    驻队干部在生产第一线，帮助生产队大办粮食，收好粮食。他们参与制订生产规划，从播种一开始就深入田间，帮助查水源、查闲散土地、查灾害，扩大种植面积，帮助生产队加强田间管理，及时总结和推广先进经验。同时，他们还建立生产档案，作到“八知道”：知道作物种类、作物亩数、播种日期、施肥数量、包工包产情况、收获日期、预计产量和有无灾情，从根本上改变了过去“等粮上门”，心中无数的现象。在粮食收获的时候，他们在管理区党组织的统一领导下，和生产队干部、老农共同组成评产小组，采取大面观察、小队自评、队队联评、实打实测的“四结合”办法，逐队逐块核实产量，并合理拟定公粮、购粮、种籽、口粮和饲料粮的分配方案。
    为了收好、收快，驻队干部还帮助生产队实行统一收割、统一打晒、统一过秤、统一入库的“四统”制度，并帮助安排劳力，参加和组织收秋、运输、打场、种麦等专业队伍，作到随收割、随打晒、随征购、随调运、随分配。
    健全制度，管粮护粮
    为了便于统筹兼顾，管好粮食，安排好生活，驻队干部帮助生产队改变了过去分散管理粮食的情况，实行粮食归队，由生产队统收统支，统一管理使用粮食。并且帮助生产队建立和健全了仓库管理制度，实行口粮、种籽、饲料和储备粮“四库分存”，专粮专用，专库保管，专人负责。各个仓库都有专账记载，出入粮食，都经过严格的审批手续，做到收有粮，付有据。这样，既便于统一安排粮食，搞好集体生活，搞好生产，也有利于国家购销计划的完成。
    驻队干部在党委领导下，还组织社员参观仓库，帮助社员认清粮食归队的好处。同时，通过保管员经验交流会，交流先进经验，进行爱粮护粮教育，并由粮站干部传授保管技术，帮助他们提高保管水平，建立和健全测温化验、清洁卫生、盘点等制度，使队队仓仓逐步做到“七无”（无霉、无虫、无鼠、无雀、无事故、无变色、无异味）。
    瞻前顾后，计划用粮
    驻队干部采取“包食堂”的办法，到公共食堂去当炊事员、管理员，帮助计划用粮，作党委组织生活的助手。粮登场后，驻队干部就帮助生产队从囤尖上开始计划用粮。他们曾及时向党支部汇报某些社员有“吃了算”、不注意计划用粮的思想，党支部立即组织社员讨论：丰收了要不要勤俭节约？省在囤尖上还是省在囤底上？咱们受灾时兄弟地区支援咱们，咱们收成好要不要支援灾区？经过回忆对比，统一了思想认识，大大鼓舞了群众发愤图强，艰苦奋斗的革命志气，一致提出要从全局出发，自己省吃俭用，省出粮食支援灾区人民，支援国家建设。在这一基础上，驻队干部根据党委指示，又帮助生产队本着“瞻前顾后、以丰补歉、细水长流、留有后备”的精神，制定了全年用粮计划和出售余粮的计划。
    发展“家底”，管好食堂
    驻队干部还帮助食堂大搞“家底”生产。驻队干部和社员们一道种菜、养猪、养鸡、养鱼，发展各种副食品生产。今年，各队种植蔬菜二千七百多亩，比去年扩大三倍；养猪六百多头，养鱼二百万尾；栽藕一百多亩。有的食堂还种植油料作物，自己制作酱油、麻酱等副食品。
    他们还帮助食堂改善经营，实行民主管理，建立“三参”、“三公”、“三通”的管理制度。三参是：驻队干部、炊事人员、社员共同参与食堂的管理。“三公”是：账目向社员公开，“家底”公开，处理社员建议的情况向社员公开。“三通”是：食堂会计、保管员、炊事员的任免，都通过社员讨论；各项节约计划通过社员制定；“家底”生产通过社员讨论决定。另外，他们还帮助食堂培训炊事员、管理员，提高他们的操作技术，改进做饭方法，经常变换饭菜花样，使社员吃省吃好。社员们称赞说：“驻队干部真是党的好助手，咱们的好管家。”
    驻队干部在党委领导下，依靠群众，帮助安排好社员生活，办好食堂，不仅大大鼓舞了社员的干劲，促进了生产的发展，同时也使这个粮站出色地完成了征购、调运、加工、储存的任务。夏季麦收，全管理区各小队只九个小时就超额完成了夏粮征购任务；秋收开始，收打入库进度也比其他地区快。
