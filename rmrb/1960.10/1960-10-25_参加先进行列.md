    The "Red Flag" brand bicycles produced by the Qingdao Bicycle Factory have caught up with the quality of the nationally renowned Shanghai "Forever" and Tianjin "Flying Pigeon" bicycles. According to the standards set by the Ministry of Light Industry, they have reached the national advanced level. The characteristics of this bicycle are: suitable structure, light and flexible, sturdy paint, beautiful colors, bright electroplating, and strong rust resistance.
    At the beginning of this year, the factory launched a competition craze of "Learning from Tianjin, Catching up with Shanghai," with everyone offering suggestions and ideas to improve quality, variety, and specifications. Old worker Sha Lunyu dissected and researched his beloved bicycle to solve the problem of paint quality. He knocked off the paint on the bicycle frame and compared it with that of the factory, and finally found the reason for the poor gloss and adhesion of the factory's paint and the solution. Engineer Zang Shiyun, who came from an old worker background, worked hard with everyone to create a half-ton small crane, which solved a key problem in the equipment, so that the paint completely met the standards. When solving the key quality problem of grinding smooth the large flywheel and large baffle, the workshop Party branch organized a manufacturing outer circle grinding shock team with Zang Shiyun and Zhao Ziyong and other old workers. After more than 20 trials, they finally manufactured an outer circle grinder with good quality and high efficiency, which improved the quality and output by more than 40% and 80% respectively compared with the original old grinder.
    Most of the steel used to manufacture bicycles is solved by the factory itself. Since the beginning of this year, they have used a half-ton small converter to smelt more than fifty kinds of alloy steel, which has greatly promoted the improvement of bicycle quality. For example, the tensile force of alloy steel chains is more than 300 kilograms higher than that of ordinary steel in the past, reaching the domestic advanced level. In addition, the workers also used indigenous methods to smelt copper and produced more than ten other raw materials.

    青岛自行车厂出产的“红旗牌”自行车，已赶上全国闻名的上海“永久”、天津“飞鸽”牌自行车的质量。根据轻工业部规定的标准鉴定，已经达到全国先进水平。这种自行车的特点是：结构适宜，轻便灵活，烤漆坚固，花色美观，电镀光亮、防锈力强。
    今年年初，这个厂就掀起了一个“学天津、赶上海”，人人为提高质量、品种、规格献策献计的竞赛热潮。老工人沙伦毓为了解决烤漆质量问题，曾把自己心爱的自行车进行解剖研究。他把车架子上的烤漆打下来同本厂的比较，终于找出本厂烤漆光洁度和附着力差的原因和解决的办法。老工人出身的工程师臧仕云，和大家苦钻苦研，创造了一个半吨小吊车，解决了设备中的关键，使烤漆完全达到了标准。在解决大飞轮、大挡等磨滑圆的质量关键时，车间党支部组织了有臧仕云和赵子永等老工人参加的制造外圆磨突击队，经过二十多次的试验，终于制成了质量又好、效率又高的外圆磨床，比用原有老式磨床的质量和产量分别提高40％和80％以上。
    制造自行车用的钢材绝大部分是这个厂自己解决的。今年以来他们用半吨小转炉炼出了五十余种合金钢，促进了自行车质量大大提高。如用合金钢的链条，拉力比过去用普通钢提高三百余公斤，达到了国内先进水平。此外，职工们还用土法炼出了铜，还生产了其他十余种原材料。
