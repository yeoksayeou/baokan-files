Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd: The joint statement of the eight Chinese people's organizations and twelve Japanese visiting delegations is as follows:

The delegations of the twelve Japanese groups visited the People's Republic of China and participated in the celebrations of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Japanese delegations were sent during the great struggle of the Japanese people against the conclusion of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

This treaty is a military alliance treaty concluded by U.S. imperialism in collusion with Japanese militarist forces to continue establishing military bases in Japan, occupying Okinawa, and strengthening the military group system in the Far East.

This treaty is a treaty that is hostile to the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries, and it is a treaty that attempts to suppress the national independence struggles of Asian countries.

The Japanese people have launched an unprecedentedly huge struggle against this attempt. Recently, in various parts of the world, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the struggles against the imperialist group headed by the United States and for national independence have echoed each other and achieved successes, and the struggle to defend peace has also developed. All this has inspired the Japanese people.

The Japanese people have achieved brilliant achievements through this great struggle. The Japanese people have contributed to the common cause of the people of the world in isolating and combating the root of war—U.S. imperialism.

The people of the People's Republic of China sincerely rejoice at the victory achieved by the Japanese people and fully support the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people.

The people of the People's Republic of China, now under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, are holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and have achieved new and great achievements in various socialist construction undertakings, and continue to enrich the experience of socialist construction.

U.S. imperialism is hostile to the great development of the People's Republic of China and its peace-loving policy. U.S. imperialism still occupies Taiwan, the territory of the People's Republic of China, and is carrying out the conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

The Chinese people's organizations and the Japanese delegations are comrades-in-arms in the struggle against U.S. imperialism.

The Chinese and Japanese people respect each other's independent and autonomous positions. Both sides firmly believe that our common struggle will surely achieve continuous victories.

In order to further strengthen the unity of the people of the two countries and to carry out the struggle to defend Asian and world peace, the delegations of the Chinese and Japanese people's organizations are determined to work hard to realize the following:

One, we advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and all international disputes should be resolved through peaceful negotiations instead of resorting to force.

Two, we must do our utmost to achieve complete disarmament, ban nuclear weapons, abolish foreign military bases, and ease international tensions.

Three, the Chinese people support the Japanese people's struggle against the new Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and the Japanese people support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan.

Four, we demand the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in Asia and the Pacific region, and demand that U.S. troops withdraw from Asian countries.

Five, we support the struggles of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries for national independence and democratic freedom, and strive to strengthen the ties and unity of the people of all countries.

Six, the Ikeda government, in accordance with the wishes of U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionary forces, is still hindering the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. However, the Japanese people strongly oppose this policy of unwillingness to ease tensions in Asia, and are carrying out a resolute struggle for the early realization of the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan.

The Chinese people distinguish between the Ikeda government, which continues to pursue a policy of hostility towards China, and the heroic Japanese people, and reiterate that the Chinese people fully support the three political principles for resolving Sino-Japanese relations put forward by Premier Zhou Enlai, and the full implementation of these three principles is the only way to open up Sino-Japanese relations.

Seven, both sides believe that the abolition of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and the prevention of the revival of Japanese militarism are indispensable factors for defending Asian and world peace. The Chinese side stated that if the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is abolished and the revival of Japanese militarism is prevented, the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance relating to the prevention of the resurgence of Japanese militarism should naturally become invalid.

Eight, the Chinese people comprehensively support the just cause of the Japanese people and activities to promote Sino-Japanese friendship. We stand on the basis of friendship, cooperation, and mutual benefit between the people of China and Japan, and strive to expand the friendly exchanges and cultural exchanges between the people of the two countries.

Nine, we hope that while the struggles of the people of the two countries are being carried out, economic exchanges between the people of the two countries will be developed, and efforts will be made to realize intergovernmental trade agreements.

    巩固反对美帝国主义的战斗友谊
    加强中日人民团结保卫世界和平
    中国八个人民团体和日本十二个访华代表团发表共同声明
    新华社3日讯　中国八个人民团体和日本各界十二个访华代表团的共同声明，全文如下：
    日本各界十二个团体的代表团这次访问了中华人民共和国，参加了建国十一周年庆祝典礼。日本代表团是在日本人民反对缔结新日美“安全保障条约”的伟大斗争中派遣出来的。
    这个条约是美帝国主义勾结日本军国主义势力，为继续在日本设立军事基地、占领冲绳岛、加强在远东的军事集团体制而缔结的军事同盟条约。
    这个条约是敌视中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家的条约，是企图镇压亚洲国家民族独立斗争的条约。
    日本人民为反对这个企图，开展了史无前例的巨大斗争。最近，在世界各地，特别是在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，反对以美国为首的帝国主义集团、争取民族独立的斗争互相呼应地获得了成就，而且维护和平的斗争也有了发展。这一切都鼓舞了日本人民。
    日本人民通过这次伟大的斗争取得了光辉的成就。日本人民在孤立和打击战争的根源——美帝国主义这一全世界人民的共同事业中作出了贡献。
    中华人民共和国的人民对于日本人民所获得的胜利衷心感到高兴，并且完全支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。
    中华人民共和国人民，现在在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的三面红旗，在社会主义建设的各项事业中取得了新的伟大成就，并且继续丰富着社会主义建设的经验。
    美帝国主义敌视中华人民共和国的伟大发展和它的爱好和平的政策。美帝国主义至今仍然占领着中华人民共和国的领土台湾，进行着制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    中国的各人民团体和日本代表团是反对美帝国主义斗争中的战友。
    中国人民和日本人民互相尊重各自的独立自主的立场。双方坚信我们的共同斗争必将获得不断的胜利。
    中日两国人民团体代表团为了进一步加强两国人民的团结，为了开展保卫亚洲和世界和平的斗争，决心努力实现以下事项：
    一、我们主张不同社会制度国家和平共处，国际间的一切争端应当通过和平谈判解决，而不诉诸武力。
    二、我们要为全面裁军、禁止核武器、撤销外国军事基地、和缓国际紧张局势尽最大的努力。
    三、中国人民支持日本人民反对新日美军事同盟条约的斗争，日本人民支持中国人民解放台湾的斗争。
    四、我们要求在亚洲和太平洋地区建立无核武器地区，要求美国军队从亚洲各国撤走。
    五、我们支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争，为加强各国人民的联系和团结而奋斗。
    六、池田政府秉承美帝国主义和日本反动势力的意旨，至今仍然阻挠中日关系的正常化。但是日本人民强烈反对这种不愿意和缓亚洲紧张局势的政策，并且为早日实现恢复中日邦交而进行坚决的斗争。
    中国人民把继续执行敌视中国政策的池田政府和英勇斗争的日本人民是区别开来的，并且重申：中国人民完全支持周恩来总理所提出的解决中日关系的政治三原则，全部实施这个三原则是打开中日关系的唯一途径。
    七、双方认为：废除日美军事同盟条约、制止日本军国主义的复活，是保卫亚洲和世界和平不可缺少的因素。中国方面表示如果日美军事同盟条约被废除，日本军国主义的复活被制止，中苏友好同盟互助条约有关防止日本军国主义再起的条款应该自然失效。
    八、中国人民全面地支持日本人民正义事业和促进中日友好的活动。我们站在中日两国人民友好、合作和互惠的基础上，努力扩大两国人民的友好往来和文化交流。
    九、我们希望与两国人民斗争开展的同时，发展两国人民之间的经济交流，并且为实现政府间的贸易协定而努力。
