    Greek "Dawn Daily" Says
    People's China is Thriving

    The Greek "Dawn Daily" published an article on the occasion of the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, entitled "New Types of People Play a Major Role in Historical Changes."

    The article wrote that thanks to the victory of the Chinese sons and daughters in their struggle against imperialism and traitors, the people's regime is thriving in the country of 650 million working people. The people's regime develops economic resources and improves the people's living standards, thereby enabling China to reach a very high level in just a few years. The newspaper said that this is something that the US imperialists are unwilling to accept, and they frantically occupy a part of Chinese territory—Taiwan—by force.

    The newspaper concluded by saying that history has already made its decision: the liberation of Taiwan is only a matter of time.

    希腊“黎明日报”说
    人民中国欣欣向荣
    希腊“黎明日报”在中华人民共和国成立十一周年的时候发表一篇文章，题目是“新型的人在历史的变化中起主要作用”。
    文章写道，由于中华儿女反对帝国主义及卖国贼的斗争的胜利，人民政权在六亿五千万劳动人民的国家中欣欣向荣。人民政权开发经济资源和提高人民生活水平，从而在不多几年中使中国达到很高的水平。报纸说，这是美帝国主义者所不甘心的，它疯狂地以武力霸占中国领土的一部分——台湾。
    报纸最后说，可是历史已经作出它的决定：解放台湾只是一个时间问题。
