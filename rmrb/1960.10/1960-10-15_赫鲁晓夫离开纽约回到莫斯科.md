Xinhua News Agency, October 14th, Dispatch from New York, TASS: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, who led the Soviet delegation to the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, left New York on the evening of the 13th by "Tu-114" plane to return to his country.

Accompanying Khrushchev were Podgorny, head of the Ukrainian delegation, Mazurov, head of the Belarusian delegation, Gromyko, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Kadar, head of the Hungarian delegation, and Sik, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic.

At New York's Idlewild Airport, Khrushchev was seen off by Zorin, the Soviet Union's permanent representative to the United Nations, Menshikov, the Soviet ambassador to the United States, Paramarchuk, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Kiselev, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic, Rapacki, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Polish People's Republic, and Soviet residents in New York.

The head of the Soviet government bid farewell warmly to all those who came to see him off, and delivered a farewell speech at the airport. Khrushchev said, "We are returning with good spirits because we believe that some glimmer of hope has appeared, making it possible to resolve major international problems through the United Nations and the General Assembly." He said, "We are particularly pleased with the decisions taken on the issue of eliminating the colonial system." "Of course, I can say that only procedural decisions were taken on discussing this issue there." He said, "However, this decision was unanimously adopted by all delegations," and that "the colonialists had to give way under the pressure of public opinion." "This is not only a great victory for the people fighting for independence, but also a great victory for the people of all countries."

Khrushchev said, "If the representatives of all countries also show such will and determination when discussing the issue of disarmament, and understand the full danger of the current situation, the General Assembly can take significant steps on the road to complete and thorough disarmament."

Khrushchev then said, "I am mainly referring to Asian and African countries, because the positions of countries participating in the military aggression blocs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Central Treaty Organization are very clearly opposed to disarmament."

Khrushchev expressed his belief that "the time will certainly come when the people of all countries deeply realize and understand the necessity of actively fighting for disarmament and demonstrate their will, and then disarmament will be achieved." He said that the Soviet Union is willing to make every effort to achieve complete and thorough disarmament and sincerely welcomes such a decision.

Khrushchev said that as he leaves New York, he would like to talk again about the Soviet delegation's proposal at the United Nations General Assembly to reorganize the executive bodies of the United Nations. He said, "The Congo incident shows that the current structure of the United Nations is completely unsuitable. Moreover, it is not only unsuitable, it is simply a threatening situation, which is caused by the fact that representatives of imperialist countries dominate in the current executive bodies of the United Nations, especially in the Secretariat."

He said, "The United Nations must be made a truly international instrument, which must be equal to every country and every group of countries, because there are clearly three groups of countries in the world today—the socialist group, the capitalist group, and the neutral group. None of these groups should have privileges in the United Nations that harm the other two groups." Khrushchev expressed his heartfelt thanks to the citizens of New York and the American people for the sincere understanding and goodwill they showed to him and other members of the Soviet delegation through letters and telegrams. He pointed out that as for those malicious people and so-called pickets and hired hands, they are merely the dregs of society and do not represent the American people.

He finally stated that the Soviet Union will continue to make every effort to ensure that the people and governments of the Soviet Union and the United States live together in peace and friendship, and hopes that the United States government will also take corresponding responsive measures.

Xinhua News Agency, October 14th, Dispatch from Moscow, TASS: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, who led the Soviet delegation to the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, returned to Moscow by plane today.

Also arriving on the same plane were Kadar, head of the Hungarian delegation to the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Podgorny, head of the Ukrainian delegation, Mazurov, head of the Belarusian delegation, as well as Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and Hungarian Foreign Minister Sik.

Welcoming Khrushchev and others at the airport were Aristov, Brezhnev, Ignatov, Kozlov, Kosygin, Mukhitdinov, Polyansky, Suslov, Furtseva, Shvernik, Pospelov, Korotchenko, Kainberzin, and Kirilenko, among others.

Many representatives of the working people of Moscow, diplomatic envoys to Moscow, and journalists also went to the airport to welcome them.

    赫鲁晓夫离开纽约回到莫斯科
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：率领苏联代表团出席联合国大会第十五届会议的苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫13日晚乘“图—114”飞机离纽约回国。
    与赫鲁晓夫同行的有乌克兰代表团团长波德戈尔内、白俄罗斯代表团团长马祖罗夫、苏联外交部部长葛罗米柯、匈牙利代表团团长卡达尔、匈牙利人民共和国外交部长西克。
    到纽约艾德威尔德机场为赫鲁晓夫送行的，有苏联常驻联合国代表佐林、苏联驻美国大使缅希科夫、乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国外交部长帕拉马尔楚克、白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国外交部长基谢廖夫、波兰人民共和国外交部长腊帕茨基、以及在纽约的苏联侨民。
    苏联政府首脑同全体送行的人热情告别，并且在机场发表了告别讲话。赫鲁晓夫说，“我们怀着良好的情绪回去，因为我们认为已经出现了一些光芒，使得有可能通过联合国和联大会议解决重大的国际问题”。他说，“我们感到特别满意的是，就消除殖民主义制度问题采取了什么样的决定。”“当然，我可以说，只是采取了关于在那里讨论这个问题的程序性决定”。他说，“但是，这个决定是各代表团一致通过的”，“殖民主义者在舆论压力下不得不让步”。“这不仅是那些为独立而斗争的人民的巨大胜利，而且也是世界各国人民的巨大胜利”。
    赫鲁晓夫说，“如果在讨论裁军问题时各国代表也表现出那样的意志和决心，了解当前局势的整个危险，联大是可以在通向全面彻底裁军的道路上作出重大步骤的。”
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，“我指的主要是亚洲和非洲国家，因为参加北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织军事侵略集团国家的立场是十分明显反对裁军的。”
    赫鲁晓夫表示相信，“各国人民深深意识和了解到为裁军进行积极斗争的必要性，并表现出自己的意志的时候一定会到来，那时裁军就会实现。”他说，苏联愿意尽一切努力来达到全面彻底裁军，并衷心地欢迎这样的决定。
    赫鲁晓夫说，他在离开纽约的时候，想再次谈一谈苏联代表团在联大会议上提出的改组联合国执行机构的建议。他说，“刚果事件表明，联合国目前的结构是完全不适合的。而且不仅不适合，它简直有着威胁的形势，这种形势是由于目前在联合国的执行机构里，特别是在秘书处里，帝国主义国家的代表占有统治地位所造成的。”
    他说，“必须使联合国成为真正的国际的工具，它对每个国家和每个国家集团都必须是平等的，因为，当今世界上明显地出现了三个国家集团——社会主义集团、资本主义集团和中立集团。这些集团中的任何一个也不应在联合国里拥有损害另外两个集团的特权。”赫鲁晓夫对纽约市民和美国人民通过信件和电报对他以及对苏联代表团的其他成员所表现的真诚谅解和善意态度表示衷心感谢。他指出，至于那些心怀恶意的人和所谓纠察队员和受雇佣者只是社会的糟粕，并不代表美国人民。
    他最后表示，苏联将来仍要尽一切努力使苏美两国人民和政府和平相处和友好相处，并且希望美国政府方面也作出相应的回答措施。
    新华社14日讯　塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：率领苏联代表团出席联合国大会第十五届会议的苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，今天乘飞机回到莫斯科。
    同机到达的还有出席联合国大会第十五届会议的匈牙利代表团团长卡达尔、乌克兰代表团团长波德戈尔内、白俄罗斯代表团团长马祖罗夫，以及苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和匈牙利外交部长西克。
