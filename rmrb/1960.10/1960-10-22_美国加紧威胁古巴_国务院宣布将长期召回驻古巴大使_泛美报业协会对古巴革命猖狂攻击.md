Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 21st: The United States is intensifying its threats and hostile activities against Cuba step by step. Following the U.S. State Department and the Department of Commerce announcing an embargo against Cuba on the 19th, the State Department, on the 20th, had its press officer, Joseph Reap, read a statement to reporters, saying that "The U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Philip Bonsal, will return to Washington immediately for a long-term briefing. No date has been set for his return to Havana."

Reap also revealed that the United States has been recently instigating Canada to join the United States in imposing a hostile "embargo" against Cuba. He said that the United States and Canada have been discussing in Washington and Ottawa for the past few weeks the issue of the so-called "possibility of a large amount of American goods being transshipped to Cuba via Canada."

Xinhua News Agency, Bogota, 20th: The Inter American Press Association "Committee on Freedom of the Press," controlled by U.S. imperialism, passed a resolution at a meeting held in the Colombian capital, making a vicious attack on the Cuban revolution. The resolution attacked the Cuban government as the "greatest enemy" of the imperialists' "freedom of speech" and demanded that Latin American News Agency be declared an agency engaged in so-called "communist subversion."

Jules Dubois, a U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who was expelled by the Cuban people last year for engaging in espionage and sabotage activities in Cuba, furiously attacked the Latin American News Agency at the meeting.

    据新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国对古巴的威胁和敌视活动正在步步加紧，继美国国务院和商务部在19日分别宣布对古巴实行禁运之后，国务院20日又由它的新闻发布官约瑟夫·里普向新闻记者宣读一项声明说，“美国驻古巴大使菲利普·邦沙尔将马上回华盛顿，进行长期的述职。没有规定他返回哈瓦那的日期。”
    里普还透露，美国最近还一直在策动加拿大和美国一起对古巴实行敌视性的“禁运”。他说，美国和加拿大过去几星期一直在华盛顿和渥太华讨论所谓“美国货物大量通过加拿大转运去古巴的可能性”的问题。
    据新华社波哥大20日电　美帝国主义控制的泛美报业协会“新闻自由委员会”在哥伦比亚首都举行的会议上通过决议，对古巴革命进行猖狂的攻击。决议攻击古巴政府是帝国主义者“言论自由”的“最大敌人”，并且要求宣布拉丁美洲通讯社是进行所谓“共产主义颠覆活动”的通讯社。
    由于在古巴进行间谍破坏活动而在去年被古巴人民驱逐出境的美国联邦调查局特务朱耳斯·杜波伊斯在会上疯狂地攻击了拉丁美洲通讯社。
