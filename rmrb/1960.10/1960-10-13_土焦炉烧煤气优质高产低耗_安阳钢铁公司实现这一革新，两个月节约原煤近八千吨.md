Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: The staff of the Coking Plant of Angang Steel Company in Henan Province have successfully created a method of using gas to coke in indigenous ovens, achieving the "foreignization" of indigenous oven coking, and opening up a new path for achieving high quality, high yield, and low consumption in indigenous oven coking. In August and September, the plant's average coal consumption per ton of coke was reduced to 2.19 tons, a decrease of 0.26 tons compared to July, saving the country nearly 8,000 tons of raw coal. Coke production and quality have also been greatly improved.

Coking in indigenous ovens accounts for more than 90% of the plant's coke production tasks. In order to produce more and better coke with the least amount of raw coal, the Party Committee of the Coking Plant, while mobilizing employees to carefully summarize and promote past production experience, also adopted a three-way combination of leading cadres, workers, and technicians to experiment with gas coking. Finally, at the end of July, they successfully created gas coking in indigenous ovens. This coking method involves extracting the gas from the coke oven through pipelines, cooling it, and then using pipelines to guide it to the small stoves in the coke oven to replace lump coal for firing. After two months of testing, it has been proven that gas coking has many advantages: first, it can eliminate the need for lump coal for ignition, saving the country more than 500 tons of prime coking coal per month; second, it can recover coal tar and comprehensively utilize coal resources; third, because the gas burns evenly and the flame is large, it greatly shortens the coking time and improves the coking rate. According to preliminary assessment, gas coking can shorten the coking time by two to three days compared to lump coal coking, increase the coking rate by 5% to 8%, and reduce the ash content of coke by about 1.2%; fourth, it reduces the labor intensity of fire-adjusting workers and improves the operating conditions for workers. Therefore, the successful experiment of gas coking is a major revolution in indigenous oven coking, opening up a new path for achieving high quality, high yield, and low consumption.

After the successful experiment of gas coking, it immediately received widespread attention from cadres and workers throughout the plant. The plant's Party Committee immediately convened an on-site meeting and formulated a plan to realize the gas chemicalization area in batches and in stages. In the process of promotion, the employees overcame the difficulties of lacking equipment and materials. Without steel pipes, they used rubber pipes and ceramic pipes instead; without valves, they used wooden blocks instead. The flange plate for making iron pipes lacked a drill press to drill holes, so fitter Zhao Cunyi and other workers worked hard for a week and successfully tested a 30 mm vertical drill. The spirit of hard work and frugality in running the enterprise of the employees greatly accelerated the promotion of gas coking. Currently, two of the plant's six work areas have fully used gas coking, and the pipeline and mechanical installation for gas coking in two work areas have been basically completed and are about to be used. The remaining two work areas are also striving to achieve gas coking in the near future. In order to accelerate the realization of gas coking, the plant also conducted education on gas operation technology for the majority of workers, especially fire-adjusting workers. They used the workshop as a classroom and real objects as teaching materials to explain the operation methods of gas coking, so that workers quickly mastered the operation technology.

    土焦炉烧煤气优质高产低耗
    安阳钢铁公司实现这一革新，两个月节约原煤近八千吨
    新华社郑州电　河南省安阳钢铁公司焦化厂职工，创造成功土炉用煤气炼焦，实现了土炉炼焦洋炉化，为土焦炉炼焦实现优质高产低耗开辟了新的途径。8、9两个月全厂每吨焦炭的耗煤量平均降低到二点一九吨，比7月份降低了零点二六吨，为国家节约原煤近八千吨；焦炭的产量和质量也有很大提高。
    这个厂的土炉炼焦占全厂焦炭生产任务的90％以上。为了用最少的原煤炼出更多、更好的焦炭，焦化厂党委在发动职工认真总结和推广以往的生产经验的同时，还采取领导干部、工人、技术人员三结合的办法，试验用煤气炼焦。终于在7月底创造成功土炉用煤气炼焦。这种炼焦方法就是把焦炉中的煤气通过管道引出，经过冷却后，再用管道引到焦炉小灶内，代替块煤烧火。经过两个月来的试验证明，煤气炼焦有很多优点：第一，可以全部不用煤块点火，全厂每月可为国家节约主焦煤五百余吨；第二，能回收焦油，综合利用煤炭资源；第三，由于煤气燃烧均匀，火苗大，大大缩短了结焦时间，提高了结焦率。据初步鉴定，用煤气炼焦比煤块炼焦可以缩短结焦时间两天至三天，提高结焦率5％至8％，焦炭灰分可以降低1.2％左右；第四，降低了调火工的劳动强度，改善了工人的操作条件。因此，煤气炼焦的试验成功，是土炉炼焦的重大革命，为土炉炼焦实现优质高产、低消耗开辟了一条新的途径。
    煤气炼焦试验成功以后，立刻受到全厂干部、工人的普遍重视。厂党委立即召开了现场会议，制定了分批、分期实现煤气化工区的规划。在推广过程中，职工们战胜了缺乏设备、材料的困难。没有钢管，他们就用胶管、陶瓷管代替，没有阀门就用木块代替。制铁管的法蓝盘缺少钻床钻眼，钳工赵存义就和其他工人一起，苦干一星期，试验成功一台三十毫米的立钻。职工们这种干劲和勤俭办企业的精神，大大加速了煤气炼焦的推广进度。目前全厂六个工区中有二个工区已全部使用煤气炼焦，二个工区的使煤气炼焦的管道、机械安装已基本完成，即将使用。其余两个工区也力争在最近实现煤气炼焦。为了加速实现煤气炼焦，这个厂还对广大工人特别是调火工进行了有关煤气操作技术的教育。他们以车间为课堂，以实物做教材，讲解煤气炼焦操作方法，使工人很快掌握了操作技术。
