People Who Bring Power to the Countryside

By our reporter Ji Jingru

At dusk, when the members of the Yangchun Management District of the Baoquan Commune in Yi'an County returned from the fields, they found that the village had undergone a great change: bright electric lights were lit from the Management District office to dozens of nearby commune members' homes. Children ran back and forth in the village and outside their houses, clapping their hands and shouting, "It's lit! It's lit!" The rattling sound of the rice mill and the rhythmic sound of the fodder processing chopper filled the air. The Yangchun Management District was as lively as if it were celebrating a grand event, with crowds of people rushing to the end of the village to see the rural mini-power station consisting of a 25-horsepower diesel engine driving a 7.5-kilowatt generator.

A young man in his twenties had just stepped down from a towering utility pole using climbing spurs when the Management District cadres and commune members surrounded him and his companions. The villagers thanked them: "This is great! You've brought us electricity. We can use machines to mill rice and chop grass, saving labor and animal power for the fields!" Everyone said, "Comrade, you must be from the power plant!" The young man smiled and replied, "We are from the Industrial Equipment Supply Station of the Yi'an County Commercial Bureau!" "Oh!" This surprised everyone.

From then on, the story of how the staff of the Yi'an County commercial departments helped rural communes to "electrify" spread.

This young man was Dong Fengshu, the then leader of the mechanical and electrical repair team of the County Equipment Supply Station and now the director of the Yi'an County Commercial Bureau Electric Motor Factory.

Dong Fengshu originally didn't understand electricity. Two years ago, he was a carpenter and a salesman at the County Commercial Bureau Equipment Supply Station. At that time, he often went to the countryside to understand the rural areas' needs for production materials. Seeing that the commune members spent a lot of labor and animal power to chop grass and mill rice, he always thought: When will the rural areas be able to use electricity to drive machines to mill rice, chop grass, and crush feed...?

It just so happened that not long after, the County Party Committee issued the call of "Industrial and Commercial Cooperation to Arm the Countryside." Dong Fengshu and everyone discussed how to repair the batch of damaged diesel engines in the warehouse of the Industrial Equipment Supply Station and equip them with small motors. Wouldn't that help rural areas establish simple mini-power stations?

The Supply Station Party Branch decided that Dong Fengshu would be responsible for forming a mechanical and electrical repair team to complete this task. A group of mechanical and electrical repair team members were transferred from all walks of life. They included those who understood selling cloth, hairdressing, and frying dough twists... but none of them understood how to repair internal combustion engines. This stumped the repair team leader Dong Fengshu. How could they complete the task of helping to build a new socialist countryside?

Go and learn from a master. With the enthusiastic support of the Party branch, Dong Fengshu went to the Xiangtai Internal Combustion Engine Factory in Harbin. When the factory workers heard that the commercial staff of Yi'an County wanted to help the rural areas set up electricity, they actively explained to him while working. However, it was not easy to master the complete set of skills for repairing internal combustion engines in a short period of time, especially since Dong Fengshu had only attended elementary school for a few years. He spent all day and night in the workshop watching, learning, and taking notes, and could only roughly remember the parts, terms, and instructions for use of the internal combustion engine. Back in the county, he bought all the relevant internal combustion engine textbooks and diesel engine principle books in the bookstore and studied them carefully. When he and his companions moved the batch of broken diesel engines from the warehouse to repair them, everyone was at a loss, not knowing where to start.

Were they really stumped? At night, Dong Fengshu tossed and turned, thinking. He recalled the scene he had seen in the countryside of farmers using manual grass choppers and animal-powered rice mills. How much the countryside needed electricity and power! He also remembered the County Party Secretary's several conversations and encouragement: "In making revolution, you will always encounter many difficulties. A revolutionary should have a strong will to overcome them." Thinking and thinking, he suddenly remembered seeing internal combustion engines made from car heads. That's it! Find a car driver!

He jumped out of bed and ran to the County Transportation Station to find driver Zhang Yushu: "I'm here to apprentice, Master Zhang!" He explained the reason to Master Zhang, and that day he hitched a ride on the long-distance bus to the Yilong Commune. Along the way, he carefully watched how Master Zhang changed gears, asking why he stepped on the accelerator, when he pulled the gear lever, and the principles of how to start the engine. When he returned from Yilong, he pestered Master Zhang to teach him how to repair the engine.

After diligent study and hard work, plus what he saw in the factory, Dong Fengshu basically understood the principle of internal combustion engines. Back at the Supply Station, he pulled out a large stack of books he had bought from the bookstore and tore down the part about the principles of internal combustion engines from each book, making his own comprehensive "textbook" for repairing internal combustion engines. Then, he led the team members to compare the illustrations in the textbook with the device of the car head, explaining and actually operating, so that everyone quickly mastered the preliminary knowledge of disassembling and repairing internal combustion engines. Everyone learned and worked at the same time. After more than 20 days, they finally made the twenty-odd broken diesel engines piled in the warehouse usable.

The diesel engines were repaired, and the small motors were either repaired or bought, and they were all ready. The time to go to the countryside to install power generation equipment as originally scheduled by the County Party Committee was getting closer and closer. At this time, everyone had not yet learned the line架设技术 (jiàshè jìshù) technology, and the mechanical and electrical repair team members were worried. Team leader Dong Fengshu smiled and received a clever plan from the Party branch. He said to everyone: "Come on, let's take down the wires on the two rooms of the office!" The team members thought that they were probably taking these wires to support the countryside, and everyone enthusiastically did it quickly. When the last team member jumped off the ladder, the team leader issued the second order: "Reinstall these wires!" This really stumped everyone. At that time, they only knew to take them down quickly, and no one noticed how they were originally installed. Seeing that everyone was stunned, Dong Fengshu said with a smile: "Let's see how the lines in the next room are installed, and just do the same, right?" Everyone thought: Right! So some drew diagrams, some sorted out the lines, and they reinstalled them in one morning. Turn on the switch, the light is on! Everyone suddenly realized that they were training everyone to master the line 架设技术 (jiàshè jìshù) technology.

The staff of the Industrial Equipment Supply Station of the Yi'an County Commercial Bureau - Dong Fengshu and his companions, just studied diligently and worked hard, learning while working, from being outsiders to electricity to learning how to try to run electricity. Later, they took batches of repaired diesel engines, small motors, and rice milling machines and grass cutters made in cooperation with industrial departments to the countryside. From the Yangchun Management District of Baoquan Commune to the Zhongxing Commune, Yilong Commune... in two years, they helped the rural areas establish a total of 24 small power stations, and installed more than 260 sets of mechanical power equipment for the commune. In order to adapt to the needs of supporting agriculture, they gradually developed a mechanical and electrical repair team of more than a dozen people into the Yi'an County Commercial Bureau Electric Motor Factory with more than 120 people. Now, they have produced more than 80 small generators, electric motors and more than 70 transformers, arming all rural communes in the county.

    给农村送动力的人
    本报记者　纪静如
    傍晚，当依安县宝泉公社阳春管理区的社员们从地里收工回来的时候，发现村子大变样：从管理区办公室到附近几十户社员家里都点上了明晃晃的电灯，村里、屋外，孩子们来回地奔跑，拍着手欢叫“亮了！亮了！”制米厂轧轧的机器声，饲料加工的铡草机声有节奏地传入人们耳中。阳春管理区像办大喜事似地闹烘烘，成群的人们奔向村子尽头，去瞧那用一台二十五马力柴油机带动一个七点五瓩发电机组成的农村小发电站。
    一个二十几岁的年青人刚从高耸的电杆上踏着脚扣子下来，管理区干部和社员们就把他和同来的伙伴们都围了起来。老乡们感谢他们：“这可好啦！给送来电了，碾米、铡草使上了机器，又可省下劳力和畜力下地了！”大家你一言、我一语地说：“同志，你们是电厂来的吧！”年青人笑答道：“我们是依安县商业局工业器材供应站的！”“哦！”这可使大家都感到十分意外。
    从此，依安县商业部门职工帮助农村公社办“电”的故事就传开了。
    这个年青人就是当时县器材供应站机电修理组长、现在依安县商业局电机厂厂长董凤书。
    董凤书原来并不懂电，两年前他还是个木工出身的、县商业局器材供应站的营业员。那时他经常下乡去了解农村对生产资料需要的情况。看到社员们费很多劳力和畜力去铡草、碾米，心里总想：什么时候让农村也能用电带动机器碾米、铡草、粉碎饲料……就好了。
    正好不久，县委提出：“工商协作，武装农村”的号召，董凤书和大伙儿就合计着，怎么能把存在工业器材供应站仓库里的那一批损坏的柴油机修复过来，配上个小电机，不是就可帮助农村建立起简易小发电站了吗？
    供应站党支部决定由董凤书负责组成一个机电修理小组来完成这个任务。并且从各方面调来了一批机电修理组员，他们有懂的卖布的、理发的、炸麻花的……却没有一个懂的修理内燃机的。这可把修理组长董凤书难住了，怎么来完成帮助建设新农村的任务呢？
    拜师取经去。董凤书在党支部的热情支持下，来到了哈尔滨祥泰内燃机厂。工厂工人们听说依安县商业职工要帮助农村办电，都主动地边干边来给他讲解。但是，在短短几天内掌握修理内燃机的全套本领，到底不是一件容易的事，何况董凤书原来只念过几年小学。他成天成夜地在车间跟着看、学、记也只能把内燃机的零件、名词、使用说明等等记个大概。回到县里，他又把书店里有关的内燃机教科书、柴油机原理等书籍都买了回来，翻书、琢磨。而当他和伙伴们一起从仓库里抬出那批坏了的柴油机来修理时，大家又蒙住了，不知从何下手？
    难道真的被难住了吗？夜里，董凤书翻来复去地思索着。他的眼前浮现了下乡时看到的农民用手工铡草、畜力碾米的情景。农村多么需要电，需要动力啊！他又想起了县委书记对自己的几次谈话、鼓励：“搞革命，总会遇到很多困难的，一个革命者应该有坚强的意志去克服它。”他想着、想着，忽然想到过去曾看到过有汽车头改成的内燃机，对！找汽车司机去！
    他一骨碌从床上起来，跑到县运输站找司机张玉书：“当学徒来了，张师傅！”他跟张师傅说明缘由，当天就跟着搭上了跑依龙公社的长途汽车。一路上，他仔细瞅着张师傅怎么变换动作？盘问着为什么踩这油门？什么时候拉变速杆？如何发动等原理。从依龙回来，他又缠着张师傅教给他怎么检修？
    经过苦钻苦学，加上在工厂里看到的，董凤书到底基本上懂得了内燃机原理。回到供应站，他又翻出了书店买来的一大堆书，把每册书上有关内燃机原理部分都拆了下来，自己订成一本检修内燃机的综合“教科书”。然后，带着组员对照着书本上的图例和汽车头的装置，边讲解、边实际操作，使大伙儿很快就掌握了拆修内燃机的初步知识。大家边学边干，先后二十几天，终于使堆在仓库里的二十几台坏柴油机都可以使用了。
    柴油机修好了，小电机修的修，买的买，也齐备了，距离县委原定下农村去安装发电设备的时间愈来愈近。这时，大伙儿对架线技术还没学会，机电修理组员们都在发愁。组长董凤书笑迷迷地从党支部领来了锦囊妙计。他对大伙儿说：“来，我们把办公室那两间屋上的电线都拆下来！”组员们以为大概是拿这些电线去支援农村，大家热情地七手八脚，果然一会儿都拆下来了。谁知当最后一个组员才从梯子上跳下来时，组长又下了第二道命令：“把这些电线重新安装上去！”这可真把大家难住了，当时只知道快拆下来，谁也没留意原来是怎么安装的啊。董凤书看大家都呆住了，就笑着说：“我们再看看隔壁屋子线路是怎么安的，照着干不就成了？”大家一想：对！于是有的画图，有的整理线路，一个上午就又安装好了。打开开关，灯亮了！大家这才恍然大悟，是在训练大家掌握架线技术呢。
    依安县商业局工业器材供应站的职工——董凤书和他的伙伴们，就是这样苦钻苦学，边学边干，由电的门外汉，到学会了试着办电。以后，他们带着成批修复的柴油机、小电机，以及和工业部门协作制成的制米机、铡草机来到了农村。由宝泉公社阳春管理区到中兴公社，依龙公社……在两年之中，帮助农村共建立起了二十四处小型发电站，为公社安装了二百六十多台机械动力设备。为了适应支援农业的需要，逐步把一个十几人的机电修理小组发展成了一百二十多人的依安县商业局电机厂。现在，他们已生产了八十多台小发电机、电动机及七十多台变压器，武装了全县各个农村公社。（附图片）
