By our Chongqing dispatch from the 29th: In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, Chongqing Nantong Coal Mine No. 1 Well has adopted methods such as strengthening workers' political and ideological work, conducting on-site drills, and strengthening management to continuously consolidate and develop the achievements of the technical revolution. This has ensured that all kinds of effective new technologies are brought into play in production. The degree of mechanization of the entire well has rapidly increased from 56% to over 90%, guaranteeing a substantial increase in coal mining and tunneling and a comprehensive leap forward in various production indicators. Compared with the second quarter, the third quarter saw: a 23.55% increase in raw coal production, a 10.7% increase in total tunneling footage, a 4% increase in work efficiency, a 12.4% reduction in costs, and a 16.4% reduction in raw material consumption. From October 1st to 25th, coal mining and tunneling increased significantly again compared to the same period in September.

Nantong Coal Mine No. 1 Well is the largest mine in the entire mining area, with a large output of coal and responsible for about half of the production tasks of the entire mine. In the first quarter of this year, during the technical innovation and technical revolution campaign, the enthusiasm of the workers was very high, and the latest coal mining technologies such as hydraulic coal mining, blasting coal falling, and slice coal cutting were quickly promoted, and coal production increased significantly. However, due to the insufficient understanding of the significant meaning of promoting new technologies by some leading cadres, their work style was not solid enough, and they lacked confidence and courage to overcome the difficulties existing in the process of promoting new technologies. Some technical measures were not followed up in time, and some specific problems were not promptly resolved. After the technical revolution campaign initially formed a climax, it was not persisted, and most of the working faces returned to using pneumatic picks and hand picks for coal mining, and coal production also greatly reduced, becoming the most backward well in the entire mine. In this situation, the mine Party committee and the well Party branch conducted a serious inspection and analysis, and fully realized that backward coal mining methods could not meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward, and insisting on promoting new technologies was the fundamental way to greatly increase production. Leading cadres of the mine and the well personally led more than 30 cadres with their bedding to go deep into the front line of production and work with the workers to contract for the promotion and use of technical revolution achievements.

After the leading cadres went down the well, they took many measures. First of all, they strengthened the political and ideological education of the workers and fully mobilized the masses to carry out debates and eliminate ideological obstacles to the promotion of new technologies. In addition to doing general mobilization, the Party organization also focused on mobilizing workers to compare the past innovations with the old methods of pneumatic pick coal mining, and calculated four accounts: output, work efficiency, safety, and saving pit wood, in response to the insufficient understanding of the superiority of the technical revolution achievements by some workers. For example, hydraulic coal mining had previously achieved more than 60 tons of coal mining per worker, which was more than six times higher than pneumatic pick coal mining, and only consumed about three tons of pit wood per thousand tons of coal mined, which was about 15% less than pneumatic pick coal mining. Through this method of mass self-education, the masses became clear-headed and expressed their willingness to restore past innovation achievements, and immediately organized batches of technical tackling teams to solve existing problems, so that the technical innovation projects that had been stopped and not used quickly resumed use. In the process of vigorously promoting and restoring new technologies, they first focused on solving the key problems in promoting new technologies. Leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers formed a "three-in-one" group, conducted collective consultations on the spot, and jointly discussed solutions, so that many production key problems were solved. For example, hydraulic coal mining in April this year, after the working face moved, due to poor design, some unreasonable mining and excavation arrangements, and two major keys of insufficient water source and poor mud coal treatment, had to be stopped for forty minutes every ten minutes of mining. The effective production time of a shift was only about one hour, and the work efficiency was very low. Deputy Mine Manager Wang Guangcan, Deputy Well Manager Lu Changhua, and more than ten engineering and technical personnel and veteran workers formed a combat commando team, went to the well together to enlarge the sedimentation tank to solve the water source problem, adopted a wide-faced electric slide to separate coal, added a set of local simple slides, and used the local slides to replace the electric slides when accidents occurred, and increased hydraulic lifting equipment, completely solving the technical problems of hydraulic coal mining, making hydraulic coal mining more perfect, and powerfully ensuring the further increase of hydraulic coal mining output. Since mid-September, the average daily output of raw coal from the working face using hydraulic coal mining has increased from more than 200 tons to more than 400 tons, and in October it has soared to more than 600 tons, and created the latest record of 880 tons, reaching the standard of a red flag working face. Other new technologies, such as blasting coal falling and coal cutting machines, have been used normally after the "three-in-one" meeting solved the key problems, and coal production has increased significantly.

This well also strengthened the training and education of workers and carried out on-site technical drills in adhering to the promotion and use of new technology coal mining. Since the third quarter of this year, in order to enable workers to quickly master new technologies, this well has adopted various methods for rapid training, so that more than 85% of the workers have mastered various new coal mining technologies in a short period of time, creating favorable conditions for adhering to the promotion and consolidation of new technologies. For example, in promoting the new coal mining technology of Yutianpu Coal Mine, they have successively opened two batches of worker training classes, organized workers for short-term off-the-job training and on-site teaching, so that all the workers in this team have learned this new coal mining technology. The blasting coal falling team adopted the method of lecturing, watching, doing, and leading, so that all workers can correctly grasp the drilling angle according to the softness and hardness and height of the coal seam, which can not only improve the drilling speed but also ensure that the supports are not knocked down.

In order to adhere to the promotion of new technologies, this well has also carried out reforms in enterprise management, incorporating the promotion and use of new technologies into the group covenant, making it a guideline that every worker must implement, and conducting regular inspections and evaluations, so that the work of promoting new technologies can be continuously consolidated and improved. For example, the blasting coal falling team incorporated the new technology of promoting blasting coal falling, correctly grasping the drilling angle, not knocking down the supports, leaving 20 blast holes for the next shift, and checking tools and equipment before work, checking progress during work, and checking safety at any time, comparing the specifications and quality of drilling and blasting, and comparing cooperation and coordination, etc., into the "three checks and two comparisons" system into the group covenant, and the workers have complied with it very well, and the work efficiency has also increased significantly. After the new technology was promoted, coal production also increased greatly. Transportation not keeping up has become a weak link in production. They carried out a "one, three, three-three (pulling three times an hour, thirty-three cars each time)" three-shift dragon cooperation competition led by leading cadres in the technical aspect, and grasped the transportation volume by the hour, so that raw coal could be transported out continuously, so that the promotion and use of new technologies could be more consolidated.

    把新技术变为工人生产的武器
    重庆南桐煤矿一井加强工人政治思想教育，开展现场练兵，坚持推广新技术
    全井机械化程度由56％迅速提高到90％，采煤、掘进等项生产指标全面跃进
    本报重庆29日电　重庆南桐煤矿一井在增产节约运动中，采取加强工人的政治思想工作，现场练兵和加强管理等方法，不断巩固、发展技术革命成果，使各种行之有效的新技术全部在生产中发挥作用，全井机械化程度迅速由56％提高到90％以上，保证了采煤和掘进的大幅度增长和各项生产指标的全面跃进。三季度与二季度比较：原煤产量提高23.55％，掘进总进尺提高10.7％，工效提高4％，成本降低12.4％，原材料消耗降低16.4％。10月1日至25日采煤和掘进又比9月同期大大增长。
    南桐煤矿一井是全矿最大的一个矿井，出煤量多，担负着全矿一半左右的生产任务。今年一季度这个井在技术革新和技术革命运动中，职工干劲很大，很快就推广了水力采煤、放炮落煤、切片割煤等最新的采煤技术，煤产量显著上升。但是因为部分领导干部，对于推广新技术的重大意义认识不足，作风不够扎实，对战胜推广新技术过程中存在的困难缺乏信心和勇气，有些技术措施没有及时跟上，有些具体问题没有抓紧解决，技术革命运动初步形成高潮以后，没有坚持下去，绝大部分工作面又回到用风镐和手镐采煤，煤产量也大大降低，成为全矿最落后的井口。在这种情况下，矿党委和井党总支进行了认真检查和分析，充分认识到落后的采煤方法，不能适应大跃进的需要，坚持推广新技术是大幅度增产的根本途径。矿和井的领导干部亲自带领三十多个干部带了被盖，深入生产第一线与工人一道包干推广和使用技术革命成果。
    领导干部下井以后采取了许多措施。首先，加强了对职工的政治思想教育，并充分发动群众开展鸣放辩论，扫除了推广新技术的思想障碍。除了作好一般动员外，党组织还针对部分职工对技术革命成果的优越性认识不足的情况，着重发动职工对过去实现的革新与风镐采煤的老办法进行对比，算了产量、工效、安全和节约坑木等四笔账。比如水力采煤，他们过去已达到每个工采煤六十多吨，比风镐采煤高六倍以上，每采千吨煤只消耗坑木三吨左右，比风镐采煤少消耗15％左右。通过这样群众自我教育的办法，群众心里亮堂了，纷纷表示要恢复过去的革新成果，并立即组织了一批又一批的技术攻关队，解决了存在的问题，使原来停顿没有用起来的技术革新项目很快恢复使用。在大力推广和恢复新技术的过程中，他们首先着重解决了推广新技术中的关键问题。由领导干部、工程技术人员和工人组成了“三结合”小组，在现场进行集体会诊，共同商量解决的办法，使很多生产关键都得到解决，例如：水力采煤在今年4月份因为工作面搬家以后，由于设计不周，采掘布置有些不合理和水源不足、泥煤处理不好两大关键，每采十分钟就要停四十分钟，一个班的有效生产时间只有一个钟头左右，工效很低。副矿长王光灿、副井长陆昌华和十多个工程技术人员、老工人组成了战斗突击组，一起到井下加大了沉淀池解决了水源问题，采用宽面电溜子脱离煤，增加了一套土简溜子，电溜子出了事故，就用土溜子代替，并增加了水力提升设备，彻底解决了水力采煤的技术问题，使水力采煤更加完善，有力地保证了水力采煤产量进一步提高。9月中旬以来，运用水力采煤的工作面原煤平均日产量已由原来二百多吨提高到四百多吨，10月份猛增到六百多吨，并创造了八百八十吨的最新纪录，达到了红旗工作面的标准。其他如放炮落煤，切煤机等新技术，经过“三结合”的会议解决关键问题后都正常使用起来了，煤产量都有显著提高。
    这个井在坚持推广使用新技术采煤中，还加强了对工人的培养和教育，开展了现场技术练兵活动。今年三季度以来，这个井为了使工人能够迅速掌握新技术，采取各种办法进行快速培训，使85％以上的工人在短期内就掌握了各种新的采煤技术，为坚持推广和巩固新技术创造了有利条件，例如他们在推广鱼田堡煤矿的采煤新技术中，先后开办了两批工人训练班，组织工人进行短期脱产训练和现场教学，使这个队的全部工人都学会了这种采煤新技术。放炮落煤队采取讲、看、做、带的办法，使全部工人都能按照煤层的软硬程度和高矮情况，正确的掌握了打眼角度，既能提高打眼速度又保证不打垮支柱。
    为了坚持推广新技术，这个井在企业管理上也进行了改革，把推广使用新技术纳入小组公约，成为每个工人必须执行的准则，并定期进行检查和评比，使推广新技术的工作不断得到巩固和提高。如放炮落煤队把推广放炮落煤的新技术、正确掌握打眼角度、不打垮支柱、上班必须为下班留下二十个炮眼，和班前查工具设备、班中查进度、随时查安全，比打眼放炮的规格质量、比协作配合等“三查两比”的制度，订入小组公约以后，工人们都遵守得很好，工效也显著提高。新技术推广以后，煤产量也大大增长。运输跟不上又成为生产上的一个薄弱环节，他们在技术方面开展了以领导干部带头参加的一、三、三三（一小时拉三次，每次拉三十三车）的三班一条龙协作竞赛，按小时抓运输量，使原煤能够源源的运出来，使新技术的推行和使用能够更加巩固。（附图片）
