Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 22nd: The broad masses of workers and staff in industry, finance and trade, culture and education, and other sectors in Tianjin have launched a campaign to recover scrap steel and iron to support steel production. According to incomplete statistics, from January to early October this year, the city's recovery of scrap steel and iron increased by 45% compared with the same period last year, strongly supporting the production of Tianjin's four steel plants.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the work of recycling scrap steel and iron, from the city to the districts, from the professional bureaus to the factories, leading groups and offices for recycling scrap steel and iron were formed. Under the unified leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the masses were mobilized to recycle scrap steel and iron in a planned and organized manner. The scrap company in Nankai District sent out eighty employees to form mobile propaganda teams, going deep into factories, government offices, schools, and streets to purchase scrap steel and iron through both propaganda and purchasing. The Tianjin Paper Mill General Plant, through various publicity activities, explained the important significance of purchasing scrap steel and iron to the workers and staff. On September 28th and 29th, more than 2,300 workers and staff participated in collecting scrap steel and iron, collecting a total of eighty-seven tons. By the end of September, the city had overfulfilled its September scrap steel and iron recycling plan by 44%, purchasing more than 1,640 tons of scrap steel and iron than in August.

To facilitate the masses in selling scrap steel and iron, various districts have also added purchasing points, established people-run agency purchasing stations, and established voluntary liaison recyclers in factories, government offices, schools, and residential areas, forming a mass scrap steel and iron recycling network, which has greatly promoted the recycling of scrap steel and iron. Scrap purchasing units also offer repair services. Old steel and iron appliances brought in by residents for sale are repaired and used as much as possible, and those that cannot be repaired are purchased, which is very popular among the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 22nd: Factories, mines, enterprises, government offices, and schools in Taiyuan City have universally launched mass activities to collect scrap steel and iron. The broad masses of workers and staff are actively clearing sites and warehouses to collect all scrap steel and iron and unusable old steel and iron equipment. Forty-one units, including the Taiyuan Boiler Factory, Taiyuan Construction Company No. 1, and Jiancaoping People's Commune, have overfulfilled their planned collection targets, sending large quantities of scrap steel and iron to the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in a timely manner. According to incomplete statistics from sixty-seven units, more than 14,220 tons of scrap steel and iron have recently been sent to the furnaces. Members of the Jiancaoping People's Commune collected 534 tons of scrap steel and iron in just ten days.

After a large amount of scrap steel and iron was transported to the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, many more steel materials have been produced.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 22nd: Steel smelting workers in Lanzhou City have collected more than 5,200 tons of various scrap steel and iron, most of which has been used in steel production and transformed into high-quality steel and steel products.

Since the beginning of this year, the output and quality of steel in various steel plants in Lanzhou City have rapidly increased, and the variety has continued to increase. Especially with the deepening of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the enthusiasm of the workers and staff has become greater and greater, and the output of steel has become higher and higher.

In order to ensure the sufficient supply of steelmaking raw materials, in addition to strengthening the work of raw material allocation and transportation, various plants have also widely mobilized the masses to carry out activities to collect scrap steel and iron. The Lanzhou Donggang Steel Plant, the Lanzhou General Machinery Plant Steelmaking Workshop, and the Steel Plant of the Third Engineering Bureau United Enterprise Company have all successively established offices and shock brigades for collecting scrap steel and iron, adopting various methods to collect and utilize scrap steel and iron. In addition to mobilizing workers and staff to pick out scrap steel and iron from the slag discharged from the iron-smelting furnaces and steelmaking furnaces, the Lanzhou Donggang Steel Plant also crushed large pieces of scrap steel that had previously stuck to the ladle and had not been cast into ingots, and then re-smelted them in the furnace.

The Steelmaking Workshop of the Lanzhou General Machinery Plant formed a shock brigade for collecting scrap steel and iron, and has collected a total of 359 tons of scrap steel and iron since August. In order to utilize the iron filings cut from machine tools in the processing workshop for steelmaking, they built an indigenous iron-smelting furnace and organized the families of workers and staff to collect the waste iron filings, melt them in the indigenous furnace, and forge them into steelmaking raw materials. The Steel Plant of the Third Engineering Bureau United Enterprise Company also established an indigenous open-hearth furnace for processing scrap steel and iron, processing all the collected scrap steel and iron and using it for steelmaking.

    把更多的废钢铁送到炉前去
    天津、太原、兰州等城市迅速回收废钢铁大批废材炼成了好钢
    据新华社天津22日电　天津市工业、财贸、文教等各行各业广大职工群众，开展回收废钢废铁运动，支援钢铁生产。据不完全统计，今年1月到10月上旬，全市回收的废钢废铁比去年同期增长45％，有力地支援了天津市四个钢厂的生产。
    为加强回收废钢铁工作的领导，从市到区，从各专业局到工厂，组成了回收废钢废铁领导小组和办公室，在中共天津市委统一领导下，有计划有组织地发动群众回收废钢铁。南开区废品公司抽出八十名职工组成流动宣传队，深入到工厂、机关、学校和街道，采取边宣传、边收购的办法收购废钢铁。天津造纸总厂通过各种宣传活动，向职工群众讲收购废钢铁的重要意义，9月28日和29日两天，参加收集废钢铁的职工达二千三百多人次，共收集八十七吨废钢铁。到9月底，全市超额44％完成了9月份废钢铁回收计划，比8月份多收购废钢铁一千六百四十多吨。
    为便于群众出售废钢铁，各区还增设收购点，建立民办代购站，并在工厂、机关、学校和居民中建立义务联络回收员，组成了一个群众性的废钢废铁回收网，大大促进了废钢铁的回收工作。各废品收购单位还开办修配业务，居民拿来出售的旧钢铁器具，能修配使用的尽量帮助他们修复使用，不能修配的就收购，很受群众欢迎。
    据新华社太原22日电　太原市各厂矿、企业和机关、学校普遍开展了收集废钢废铁的群众性活动。广大职工为把一切废钢废铁和不能使用的旧钢铁器材统统收集起来，积极清场、清仓。太原锅炉厂、太原建筑一公司，尖草坪人民公社等四十一个单位都超额完成了预定的收集计划，把大批废钢废铁及时送到太原钢铁公司。据六十七个单位不完全统计，最近已将一万四千二百二十多吨废钢废铁送到炉前。尖草坪人民公社的社员只用十天时间，就收集了五百三十四吨废钢铁。
    大批废钢废铁运到太原钢铁公司以后，已经多生产出许多钢铁材料。
    据新华社兰州22日电　兰州市钢铁冶炼职工已经收集各种废钢铁五千二百多吨，绝大部分用于炼钢生产以后，变成了优质钢和钢材。
    兰州市各钢铁厂今年以来钢的产量、质量迅速提高，品种不断增加。特别是随着增产节约运动的深入开展，职工群众的干劲越来越大，钢的产量越来越高。
    各厂为保证炼钢原料的足够供应，除加强原料调运工作以外，并广泛发动群众开展收集废钢废铁的活动。兰州东岗钢厂、兰州通用机器厂炼钢车间和第三工程局联合企业公司炼钢厂，都先后成立了收集废钢废铁办公室和突击队，采取各种办法收集和利用废钢废铁。兰州东岗钢厂除发动职工从化铁炉和炼钢炉排除的矿渣内拣出废钢铁以外，并把以往沾包没铸成锭的大块废钢破碎以后再回炉重炼。
    兰州通用机器厂炼钢车间组成收集废钢废铁突击队，从8月以来，共收集废钢铁三百五十九吨。他们为利用加工车间机床上切下的铁屑进行炼钢，建立了一座土炼铁炉，组织职工家属，把废铁屑收集起来，用土炉子熔炼以后，锻成炼钢原料。第三工程局联合企业公司钢厂，还建立了处理废钢铁的土平炉，把收集来的废钢铁经过处理加工，全部用于炼钢。（附图片）
