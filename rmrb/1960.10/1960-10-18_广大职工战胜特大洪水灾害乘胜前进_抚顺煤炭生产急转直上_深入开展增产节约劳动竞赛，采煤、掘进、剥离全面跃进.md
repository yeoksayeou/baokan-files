Our newspaper Fushun dispatch on the 17th: Under the leadership of the Fushun Municipal Party Committee, the vast workers of the Fushun Coal Mine, having overcome the extraordinary flood disaster, advanced victoriously and achieved brilliant results in a substantial and sustained increase in coal production. In late September, the average daily coal output of the entire mine increased by 23.1% compared to the first and middle ten days of September. In the first half of October, the average daily coal output increased by another 15.3% compared to late September. The average daily output of coking coal in the first half of October increased by 18.6% compared to late September. Tunneling increased by 9.1%, and open-pit stripping increased by 22.1%. The entire mine has seen a great situation of all-round advancement in coal mining, tunneling, stripping, and other work.

In order to produce more coking coal to support steel production, the Fushun Municipal Party Committee summarized the achievements and experiences of the previous stage of the production increase and conservation campaign in September, and took various practical measures to strengthen leadership over the coal mines. Led by Shen Yue, First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, nearly 300 cadres from the city formed a work team that went deep into the mine pits and underground, on the one hand, to widely carry out propaganda and education on deepening the production increase and conservation campaign, mobilizing all mine workers to launch a vigorous labor emulation drive, work hard for the last 100 days of this year, and strive to overfulfill the coal production plan; on the other hand, they fought side by side with the workers, helping to solve specific problems at any time, pushing the production increase and conservation campaign to a new climax. At the same time, the Fushun Mining Bureau also focused on preparing for coal production, strengthening the production preparation front for tunneling, stripping, and equipment maintenance, and doing everything possible to prepare for various productions to ensure sustained leap forward in coal production in the fourth quarter.

In the deep development of the production increase and conservation campaign, Fushun coal mine cadres were transferred downwards level by level, strengthening the front line of production. At present, each mine has transferred more than 1,000 cadres, including deputy mine managers, general branch secretaries, section chiefs, and team leaders, some directly participating in production labor, some strengthening the leadership of the main work shifts, thereby enabling many key production problems of the work shifts to be quickly resolved. For example, in response to the key problem of frequent failures and low efficiency of electric locomotives, the Party Committee of the Laohutai Mine promptly approved seven veteran drivers to be reassigned to electric locomotives as drivers; the old generals took to the field, mechanical failures were quickly reduced, and transportation efficiency was greatly improved. In their work, they also served as "technical consultants" for new drivers, helping them to quickly improve their technical level. After sixteen cadres from the coal mining section of the West Open-pit Mine were transferred to the main work shifts, many old key production problems were resolved within a few days, so that in early October, the coal output of the entire section increased by 23% compared with late September. Cadres who remained in their original positions also generally implemented underground office work, dividing up areas of responsibility, going deep into the work shifts, eating, living, working, and consulting with the workers, making the work shift production thrive.

In the movement, the entire mine carried out a large-scale high-yield competition centered on the "multi-treasure combination," erecting models and planting red flags. Since the launch of the movement, 100 advanced coal mining teams, tunneling teams, and other advanced teams and groups with the "multi-treasure combination" have emerged in the entire mining area, resulting in a moving scene of small areas surpassing large areas, work shifts surpassing sections, backward surpassing advanced, and advanced reaching new heights. The first work shift of the sixth district of the Laohutai Mine, where the nationally famous advanced producer Pang Guanxiang is located, combined its 14 years of advanced experience into an "fourteen-in-one" advanced operation method, making the average daily output level reach more than 1,000 tons, realizing a large-scale bumper harvest, and becoming a high-yield model. The shifts then launched a high-yield competition to learn from, compare with, catch up with, and surpass the Pang Guanxiang work shift. At present, more than 1,000 models have emerged in West Open-pit and Laohutai, the work shift competition is in full swing, and the production level is constantly improving. Fifty-one work areas and seven hundred and sixty-four groups from the West Open-pit Mine participated in the work shift competition to catch up with the Pang Guanxiang work shift, which increased the mine's coal production by an average of 20.7% in the first half of October compared with late September.

The broad masses of the Fushun City have done their best to support coal production, and a upsurge in support of coal production has rapidly formed throughout the city. This support has developed from industrial departments to all walks of life, from employees to residents, truly providing people when needed and materials when needed, with support coming from all directions. To date, 31 units in the city have supported the major equipment of each mine with as many as tens of thousands of pieces of 83 kinds. Because this national support and the vigorous mass movement within the mining area have converged into a torrent, many weak links have been readily resolved. For example, a weak link in the capacity of electric locomotives appeared in the West Open-pit Mine. After the workers of a dozen units in the city learned about it, they immediately dispatched elite troops and dispatched a large number of spare parts, concentrated manpower and material resources, renovated all the electric locomotives, increased the number of electric locomotives dispatched from the entire mine, and increased the transportation capacity by 35% compared to the past.

    广大职工战胜特大洪水灾害乘胜前进
    抚顺煤炭生产急转直上
    深入开展增产节约劳动竞赛，采煤、掘进、剥离全面跃进
    本报抚顺17日电　抚顺煤矿广大职工在市委领导下，战胜特大洪水灾害之后，乘胜前进，夺得了煤炭生产大幅度持续上升的辉煌成就。9月下旬，全矿煤炭平均日产量比9月上中旬增长23.1％，10月上半月煤炭平均日产量又比9月下旬增长15.3％，炼焦精煤10月上半月平均日产量比9月下旬增长18.6％，矿井掘进增长9.1％，露天剥离增长22.1％。全矿出现了采煤、掘进、剥离等各项工作全面跃进的大好局面。
    为了生产更多焦煤支援钢铁生产，中共抚顺市委在9月间总结了前一阶段增产节约运动的成就和经验，并且采取各种切实措施，加强对煤矿的领导。在市委第一书记沈越的率领下，全市近三百名干部组成工作组深入各矿坑下、井下，一面广泛进行深入开展增产节约运动的宣传教育，发动全矿职工开展了轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛，大干今年最后一百天，力争超额完成煤炭生产计划；一面和工人一起并肩奋战，随时帮助解决具体问题，把增产节约运动推向新的高潮。与此同时，抚顺矿务局也狠抓煤炭生产准备工作，充实掘进、剥离、设备检修的生产准备战线，千方百计做好各项生产准备，保证第四季度煤炭生产持续跃进。
    在深入开展增产节约运动中，抚顺煤矿干部层层下放，加强了生产第一线。现在，各矿已经下放副矿长、总支书记、段长、班长等干部达一千多名，有的直接参加生产劳动，有的充实主力班组的领导，从而使许多班组的生产关键问题迅速得到解决。如老虎台矿党委针对电机车常出故障、效率不高的关键问题，及时批准了七名老司机出身的干部，全部下放到电机车上重新当司机；老将一上阵，机械故障迅速减少，运输效率大大提高。在劳动中，他们还当了新司机的“技术顾问”，帮助新司机迅速提高技术水平。西露天矿采煤段十六名干部下放到主力班组之后，许多老的生产关键在几天之内就得到了解决，因而10月上旬全段煤炭产量比9月下旬增长23％。留在原来工作岗位的干部，也普遍实行井下办公，分片包干，深入到班组，与工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，使班组生产蒸蒸日上。
    在运动中，全矿开展了以“多宝合一”为中心内容的大面积高产竞赛，大树标兵、大插红旗。运动开展以来，全矿区已涌现出一百个“多宝合一”的先进采煤队、掘进队和其他先进班、组，因而出现了小区超大区、班超区、后进超先进、先进更上一层楼的动人景象。全国著名先进生产者庞观祥所在的老虎台矿六区一班，把多年来的十四项先进经验配成“十四合一”的先进操作方法，使平均日产水平达到一千吨以上，实现了大面积丰产，成为高产标兵。各班随即展开了学、比、赶、超庞观祥班的高产竞赛。目前，西露天、老虎台已经涌现出一千多名标兵，班组竞赛轰轰烈烈，生产水平不断提高。西露天矿五十一个班区，七百六十四个小组参加了追赶庞观祥班的班组竞赛，使10月上半月全矿煤炭产量比9月下旬平均增长20.7％。
    抚顺市广大群众都尽力支援煤炭生产，在全市范围内迅速形成了支援煤炭生产的热潮。这种支援由工业部门发展到各行各业，由职工发展到居民群众，真是要人有人，要物有物，四面八方支援上门。到目前为止，全市有三十一个单位支援各矿主要器材达83种数万件之多。由于这种全民性的支援和矿区内部轰轰烈烈的群众运动汇成一股洪流，许多薄弱环节迎刃而解。如西露天矿出现了电机车能力不足的薄弱环节，全市十几个单位的职工知道后，立即派出精兵良将和调遣大批备品配件，集中人力物力，把全部电机车整修一新，使全矿电机车出动台数增多，运输能力比过去提高35％。（附图片）
