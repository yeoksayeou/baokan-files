With the deepening development of the production increase and economy practice movement centered on grain and steel, a new upsurge of socialist labor emulation has been launched on the industrial production, transportation, and capital construction fronts. The most significant characteristic of this labor emulation is that many enterprises pay close attention to the competition between grassroots production organizations, and firmly plant the roots of the competition in the production teams. Therefore, it is both vigorous and down-to-earth. This is an important sign that economic work is becoming more meticulous and the leadership style is becoming more practical.

Socialist labor emulation is an effective way to organize the masses to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, help the backward, rapidly improve production efficiency, and accelerate socialist construction. In recent years, the forms of labor emulation that have appeared in our country are rich and varied. Competitions between enterprises and between different enterprises in the same type of work, collaborative competitions, technical performance competitions, model worker selection competitions, technical breakthrough competitions, and production sports meets are all familiar forms to the broad masses of workers. No matter what kind of competition, the purpose is to mobilize the masses to the fullest extent and strive to complete and over fulfill the state plan on a team, daily, ten-day, and monthly basis. But no matter what kind of competition, focusing on organizing competitions between production teams can achieve the most practical results in increasing production and practicing economy. Why? Because the production team is the basic unit of enterprise production and management. The enterprise's plan to increase production and practice economy must be implemented in the production team; the enterprise's measures to increase production and practice economy must be realized through the production team. Organizing labor emulation based on the production team can mobilize and organize the masses most deeply and fully. Because the scope of the production team is relatively small, and the production teams are relatively close to each other, not only are the conditions in various aspects such as manpower, materials, technology, and equipment easy to understand, but also the production results of the day, the new experiences and new technologies created on the day, can be known to each other and exchanged on the day. In other words, organizing labor emulation based on the production team is more conducive to carrying out activities of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping. The new achievements created by this production team today may become the goal of that production team to catch up tomorrow, and the new technologies and new experiences you create today may become the content of my learning tomorrow. If one production team improves production efficiency, other production teams can quickly catch up. The enterprise's plan is composed of production team plans, and every production team can complete and over fulfill the state plan on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis in the competition. The entire enterprise will also have a practical guarantee to achieve the completion and over fulfillment of the state plan on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis.

Effectively grasping specific measures and carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution are the central links to ensure that the labor emulation achieves the expected results and continues to develop. Measures are the ways to achieve indicators. "Ten-point indicators, twelve-point measures." The competition indicators must be advanced and specific, and the guaranteeing measures must also be advanced and specific. The indicators are high-yield, high-quality, low-consumption, high-efficiency, and safe and comprehensive leap forward, and the measures must also be a comprehensive leap forward. Therefore, it is necessary not only to mobilize the masses to discuss the competition indicators so that they have clear goals, but also to mobilize the masses to discuss the measures so that they know how to achieve the goals and are full of confidence. Of course, there are many kinds of measures, but the most fundamental is to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, and to strengthen team management. Why do we say that? Because only by continuously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, that is, continuously reforming the material and technical conditions of production (means of labor and objects of labor), and improving and strengthening enterprise management according to the needs of technical innovation and technical revolution, can we increase production, improve quality, reduce raw material consumption, save labor, and ensure safe production, and can we achieve both labor and rest. Therefore, we must combine labor emulation with technical innovation and technical revolution, and combine labor emulation with improving enterprise management. Every reform of a technology, every promotion of a new experience, and every improvement of a rule or regulation is for the purpose of increasing production, improving quality, reducing costs, saving labor, and strengthening safety, and is also for the purpose of better completing and over fulfilling the state plan on a team, daily, and ten-day basis. In this way, labor emulation has a practical support, and technical revolution has a clear goal. The more in-depth the labor emulation, the more technical innovation and technical revolution will develop, and the more the material and technical conditions of production will be strengthened. The strengthening of material and technical conditions, in turn, promotes the development of labor emulation.

To carry out labor emulation based on the production team, we must focus on evaluation, which is a very important political and organizational work in labor emulation. Evaluation is not only for evaluating advanced figures and model production teams, but more importantly, for summarizing experience and finding out the reasons why the advanced are advanced and the backward are backward; it is not only for awarding advanced figures and advanced production teams, but more importantly, for organizing other workers and other production teams to learn from advanced producers and advanced production teams, and to turn the new technologies and new experiences mastered by a few people and a few production teams into wealth that most people and most production teams can master. That is to say, evaluation is for mutual help and common improvement. Therefore, evaluation does not mean the end of the competition, but the beginning of a new upsurge of the next greater competition, and the beginning of the overall improvement of the social production level and production efficiency from the current level. Constantly evaluating, constantly launching upsurges of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping, the social production level will continue to be improved. During the evaluation, for advanced production teams, we must not only see their advantages, but also see where they have not done enough. For backward production teams, we must not only see where they have not done enough, but also see their advantages. Pointing out the shortcomings of advanced production teams is to point out the direction of progress for them and prevent complacency. Pointing out the advantages of backward production teams is to encourage them to catch up with the advanced better, and also to allow others to learn from their advantages. Therefore, the party organizations, administrative organizations, trade union organizations, and communist youth league organizations of enterprises must not only be good at mobilizing and organizing workers to participate in evaluation, but also educate them with the communist spirit of learning from the advanced and helping the backward, and educate them with the idea of continuous revolution. We must make all workers consciously and actively teach others their new experiences and new technologies, and at the same time consciously and modestly learn from others, learn from each other, care for each other, and improve together. In this way, in the labor emulation, we can not only improve technology and improve labor efficiency, but also improve the socialist and communist consciousness of workers; we can not only get more and better steel, coal, and various industrial products, but also cultivate more fighters with communist style to build socialism.

We emphasize carrying out labor emulation between production teams in order to more effectively organize competition between production units above the production team. Therefore, after the labor emulation between production teams is organized, leadership departments and enterprise units at all levels should, on this basis, organize competition between blast furnaces, open hearth furnaces, workshops, mining and excavating working faces, stations and stations, docks and docks, as well as factories and factories, and mines and mines. Enterprises with similar scales and material and technical conditions can organize competitions, small enterprises can also compete with large enterprises, and enterprises with relatively poor conditions can also compete with enterprises with relatively good conditions. Organizing this kind of competition is the same as organizing production team competitions. We must mobilize the masses to set advanced and reliable competition indicators, formulate practical and specific measures, and conduct regular evaluations in a timely manner. Exchange experiences, learn from others' strengths, and make up for one's own shortcomings. With production team competitions and competitions between production units above the production team, the production increase and economy practice movement centered on grain and steel can be carried out more vigorously.

### 深入开展以班组为基础的劳动竞赛

    深入开展以班组为基础的劳动竞赛
    随着以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的深入发展，一个社会主义劳动竞赛的新高潮，已在工业生产、交通运输和基本建设战线上掀起来了。这一次劳动竞赛的最大特点，就是许多企业都十分注意基层生产组织之间的竞赛，把竞赛的根子牢牢地扎在班组上面，因而既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。这是经济工作越做越细致，领导作风越来越踏实的一个重要标志。
    社会主义劳动竞赛，是组织群众比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进，迅速提高生产效率，加速社会主义建设的有效办法。近年来，在我国出现的劳动竞赛的形式是丰富多彩的。同企业的和不同企业的同工种竞赛，协作竞赛，技术表演赛，标兵选拔赛，技术攻关赛，以及生产运动会等等，都是广大职工群众所熟悉的形式。不论是哪一种竞赛，目的都是为了最充分地发动群众，争取按班、按日、按旬、按月地完成和超额完成国家计划。但不论是哪一种竞赛，把竞赛的重点放在组织班组之间的竞赛，最能收到增产节约的实效。为什么呢？因为班组是企业生产和管理的基层单位。企业的增产节约计划，要落实到班组；企业增产节约的措施，要通过班组来实现。以班组为基础组织劳动竞赛，就可以最深入、最充分地把群众发动起来，组织起来。由于班组的范围比较小，各班组之间又比较接近，不但人力、物力、技术、设备等各个方面条件，彼此容易了解，而且当天的生产成绩，当天创造的新经验、新技术，当天就可以彼此知道，当天就可以交流。也就是说，以班组为基础组织劳动竞赛，更便于开展比、学、赶、帮活动。这个班组今天创造的新成就，可能就成为那个班组明天追赶的目标，你今天创造的新技术、新经验，可能就成为我明天学习的内容。一个班组提高了生产效率，其他班组很快就可以跟上来。企业的计划由班组计划组成，每一个班组在竞赛中都能按日、按旬、按月地完成和超额完成国家计划，整个企业实现按日、按旬、按月地完成和超额完成国家计划，也就有了切实的保证。
    切实地抓具体措施，开展技术革新、技术革命，是保证劳动竞赛收到预期的效果，并且持续地开展下去的中心环节。措施是实现指标的办法。“十分指标，十二分措施。”竞赛指标要先进、具体，保证的措施也要先进、具体。指标是高产、优质、低消耗、高效率和安全全面跃进的，措施也必须是全面跃进。所以，不但要发动群众讨论竞赛指标，使他们目标明确，还要发动群众讨论措施，使他们知道怎样达到目标，充满信心。措施，当然是多种多样的，但是最根本的是开展技术革新和技术革命，是加强小组管理。为什么这样说呢？因为只有不断地开展技术革新、技术革命，即不断地改革生产的物质技术条件（劳动手段和劳动对象），以及根据技术革新、技术革命的需要改进和加强企业管理，才可以做到既增加产量，又提高质量，降低原料材料消耗，节约劳动力和安全生产，才可以做到既有劳又有逸。因此，我们必须把劳动竞赛和技术革新、技术革命结合起来，把劳动竞赛和改进企业管理结合起来。每改革一项技术，每推广一项新经验，每改进一项规章制度，都是为了增加产量，提高质量，降低成本，节约劳动力，加强安全，也就都是为了更好地按班、按日、按旬地完成和超额完成国家计划。这样，劳动竞赛便有了切实的靠头，技术革命又有明确的目标。劳动竞赛越深入，技术革新、技术革命就越向前发展，生产的物质技术条件也就越加强。物质技术条件的加强，又反过来推动劳动竞赛的发展。
    开展以班组为基础的劳动竞赛，必须抓评比，这是劳动竞赛中一项极重要的政治工作和组织工作。评比，不只是为了评出先进人物、模范班组，而且更重要的，是为了总结经验，找出先进的所以先进、落后的所以落后的道理；也不只是为了给先进人物、先进班组发奖，而且更重要的，是为组织其他职工、其他班组向先进生产者和先进班组学习，是为了把少数人和少数班组掌握的新技术、新经验，变为大多数人和大多数班组都能掌握的财富。也就是说，评比是为了互相帮助，共同提高。所以，评比不是意味着竞赛的结束，而是意味着下一次更大的竞赛新高潮出现的开端，是社会生产水平和生产效率普遍地从现有水平向前提高一步的开端。不断地评比，不断地掀起比、学、赶、帮的高潮，社会生产水平就不断地得到提高。在评比的时候，对先进的班组，不但要看到他们的优点，还要看到他们做得不够的地方。对后进班组，不只要看到他们做得不够的地方，还要看到他们的优点。指出先进班组的缺点，为的是给他们指出前进的方向，防止骄傲自满。指出后进班组的优点，为的是鼓舞他们更好地赶上先进，同时也是为了别人学习他们的优点。因此，企业的党组织、行政组织、工会组织和共青团组织，不但要善于动员和组织职工群众参加评比，而且要用见先进就学、见后进就帮的共产主义精神教育他们，要用不断革命论的思想教育他们。我们要使所有的职工都要自觉地主动地向别人传授自己的新经验、新技术，同时又要自觉地虚心地向别人学习，互相学习，彼此关心，共同提高。这样，我们就可以在劳动竞赛中，不只能提高技术，提高劳动效率，还能够提高职工的社会主义和共产主义觉悟；不只能得到更多更好的钢铁、煤炭和各种工业产品，还能培养更多具有共产主义风格的建设社会主义的战士。
    我们强调开展班组之间的劳动竞赛，是为了更切实地组织班组以上生产单位之间的竞赛。所以，当班组之间的劳动竞赛组织起来以后，各级领导部门和企业单位，应当在这个基础上，组织高炉与高炉，平炉与平炉，车间与车间，采掘工作面与工作面，车站和车站，码头与码头，以及工厂与工厂，矿山与矿山之间的竞赛。规模相当、物质技术条件类似的企业之间可以组织竞赛，小企业也可以赛大企业，条件比较差的企业也可以赛条件比较好的企业。组织这种竞赛也跟组织班组竞赛一样，要发动群众订出先进而可靠的竞赛指标，订出切实具体的措施，也要定期进行评比，及时交流经验，取他人之长，补自己之短。有了班组竞赛，又有班组以上生产单位之间的竞赛，以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动，就可以更加生气勃勃地开展起来了。
