Xinhua News Agency, San Salvador, October 27th: Amidst angry protests against the pro-American dictatorial rule, El Salvador's President José María Lemus was ousted in a coup on the 26th. A five-member committee has taken over the government and appointed new cabinet ministers. Three of the committee members are military personnel.

Lemus has been allowed to go to Guatemala, accompanied by the President's Secretary-General.

Lemus came to power in 1956. He recently held talks with the President of Guatemala, mutually guaranteeing to further suppress democratic and patriotic forces and eliminate the influence of the Cuban revolution in both countries.

The coup on the 26th is seen as a manifestation of the inability of the ruling authorities in El Salvador, headed by Lemus, to maintain their policy of following the United States in opposing Cuba and brutally suppressing domestic democratic and patriotic forces. In order to quell the strong public dissatisfaction, it is reported that the coup committee announced the release of some political prisoners arrested in the previous period.

News from Washington says that Lemus's resignation did not surprise Washington officials.

    萨尔瓦多发生政变
    独裁者莱穆斯被迫下台后已去危地马拉
    据新华社27日讯　圣萨尔瓦多消息：在反对亲美独裁统治的愤怒抗议声中，萨尔瓦多总统何塞·马里亚·莱穆斯在26日的一次政变中被赶下了台。一个由五人组成的委员会接管了政权，并且任命了新的内阁部长。委员会中三个人是军人。
    莱穆斯已经得到允许，在总统秘书长的伴同下去了危地马拉。
    莱穆斯是在1956年上台的。他刚在不久前同危地马拉总统进行会谈，相互保证要进一步镇压民主爱国力量，并且消除古巴革命在这两个国家里的影响。
    26日的这次政变被认为是以莱穆斯为首的萨尔瓦多执政者无法照旧维持其追随美国反对古巴和残暴镇压国内民主爱国力量的政策的表现。为了平息群众的强烈不满，有消息说，政变委员会宣布释放在前一时期中逮捕的一些政治犯。
    来自华盛顿的消息说，莱穆斯的下台没有使华盛顿官方人士感到吃惊。
