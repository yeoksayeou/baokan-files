At the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, amidst the crowds of steelworkers, there is a worker named Chen Liwen. He is tall, wears a white canvas work suit with the top buttons undone, covered in oil stains, and has a tanned, ruddy face with a full beard. Perhaps because the helmet is too small, or because of his large frame, the protective helmet on his head seems so small that it appears rather amusing. He is an optimistic person. Although he is already forty-five years old and has experienced many hardships in life, when he squints his eyes and smiles, he looks as innocent as a child. Chen Liwen is a pipe fitter.

Those who have been to steel mills probably know that in the steel mills of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, there are countless large and small pipes made of steel: gas pipes, steam pipes, air pipes, water pipes, tar pipes… Some are almost as large as the chimneys of ordinary factories, some straight, some winding, erected on the horizontal and vertical steel frames in the air, like countless vines climbing on a melon trellis, crisscrossing and leading to various workshops, leading to tall steel furnaces. For steel mills, steel cannot be made without these many pipes, and the installation, repair, and construction of these countless large and small pipes cannot but be a huge and magnificent project. What Chen Liwen and his colleagues do is this line of work.

Needless to say, those who can do this line of work are not simple! However, among the steelworkers, some young men are unwilling to do this. In their minds, doing this is not as impressive as operating a crane, nor as awe-inspiring and eye-catching as working in front of the furnace. Of course, is there anything to criticize about loving the honor of socialism and communism? In the sky with crisscrossing steel frames and reflecting steel water, surrounded by flying sparks, flying back and forth in the air with a rumbling crane, that is indeed enviable; in front of a fiercely burning steel furnace, holding a steel bar, watching the rolling steel being smelted by one's own hands, forging a better life for people, how can one not feel glorious and proud? Therefore, musicians write lyrical songs for our crane operators, and poets of the new era write many poems praising the workers in front of the furnace. However, when our singers spread honor in the world, they should also pay attention to the countless inconspicuous people who were once unknown.

For example, when the furnace workers, their faces flushed by the flames and molten steel, wearing protective helmets and holding steel bars, are fighting with the fiercely rolling, boiling steel furnace, the bell for tapping the steel rings, and huge steel ladles are filled with molten steel; when the crane operators drive the crane to lift ladle after ladle of molten steel back and forth in the air, in places that are not noticed by people, outside a roaring, bustling factory building, the winter north wind is howling, and the severe cold makes water freeze into ice, busy beside a pipeline are the pipe fitters. That is a water pipe leading to the factory building, because it has a crack, and water is gushing out. It is those pipe fitters who are braving the howling north wind and the biting cold to repair the cracked water pipe. The water leaking from the cracked water pipe into the ditch is getting deeper and deeper, and someone needs to stand in the water. So, from that group of young pipe fitters, a tall middle-aged man came out and jumped into the knee-deep ice water, silently standing and working for two or three hours. Many young men wanted to go down to replace him, but he said, "Your bones are still soft and can't stand the cold," and didn't let anyone go down to replace him. When the crack in the water pipe was repaired, when he climbed out of the water, the legs of his cotton trousers had frozen stiff, like stone carvings. Who is this? This is Chen Liwen, the leader of the pipe fitting team.

In the spring of 1958, the pipe fitters were installing an underground pipeline. One day, they encountered a large cement pier buried underground where the pipeline passed. The pickaxe could not dig it open, and even with a sledgehammer, only a small piece could be knocked off with each blow. After hitting it for half a day, the cement pier still did not move. That morning, Chen Liwen went to the hospital to see a dentist because of a toothache and was not at the construction site. When he arrived at the hospital, the dentist took a look and said that the tooth had to be extracted. It was simple enough. He sat on the fully equipped swivel chair in the dental clinic and let the dentist's pliers and tweezers fiddle around in his mouth for a while. Finally, the tooth was pulled out all at once. The doctor used tweezers to clamp a small piece of cotton dipped in iodine and put it into the socket, telling Chen Liwen, "Hold it tightly and spit it out after two hours." This was awkward, like something stuck in his throat, and the pain started to kick in, because he had been given anesthetic when they pulled the tooth, he didn't feel the pain at the time. Chen Liwen returned to the factory with an awkward feeling, and it was already lunchtime. He didn't want to eat and ran to the construction site. He saw that the people in his team were still hitting the cement pier with a sledgehammer, but the cement pier remained motionless. Chen Liwen told everyone to stop work and go back to eat, and he stayed there alone to watch the tools. Once everyone left, he sat alone next to the cement pier. The socket became more and more painful, and looking at the cement pier, it seemed to be deliberately teasing him. Chen Liwen suddenly stood up, swung the sledgehammer with both hands, and struck the cement pier with full force, breaking it into several large pieces in a few strokes. When the workers came back after eating, the cement pier was gone. They saw Chen Liwen sitting on a mound with his hands on his cheeks, his face swollen. At that time, it became popular to plant red flags. After the underground pipeline was completed, people planted a large red flag for Chen Liwen. Then, Chen Liwen's pipe fitting team accepted the task of installing a tar spraying pipe, erecting more than a thousand meters of tar spraying pipe from the air to the open-hearth furnace. After this project was completed, the smelting time of each furnace of steel was shortened by half an hour. As a result, the steel mill's leap forward production was guaranteed to be completed according to plan.

Leap forward year after year, a wave of socialist construction is surging across China. Day and night, smoke is rolling and red light fills the sky above Anshan Iron and Steel Company. The footsteps of the Chinese people shook the world. The people, full of light, were jubilant, while those dark-souled reptiles were furious. However, Chen Liwen only cared about going his own way, dedicating his life wholeheartedly to the great ideals of mankind. In July of this year, Chen Liwen's pipe fitting team installed a soda water pipe for the steelworkers in front of the furnace. In the steelmaking workshop of the steel mill, the steelworkers in front of the furnace hold steel bars and work hard day and night in front of the fiercely burning, sparkling steel furnace, and they still have to wear thick canvas work clothes. Although the blowers are blowing at them constantly, they are still baked as if in a sea of fire. In the hot summer, it is even hotter. Originally, the factory prepared quenching soda for the workers in the high-temperature workshop, but the workers needed to fetch it from the soda factory to the workshop in pots. In order to allow the workers in front of the furnace to drink more and more abundant soda water at all times, Chen Liwen's pipe fitting team installed a special water pipe to transport soda water to them. The soda water pipe was installed from the soda factory, along the steel frame on top of the steelmaking workshop, all the way to the steelmaking furnace in front of the workshop. Chen Liwen led two young men from the pipe fitting team to climb on the high steel frame. Below was the fierce fire of the steel furnace, and around them was a high altitude with rolling smoke and boiling steel water. At first, they brought a pot of cold boiled water every day to climb up the steel frame to install the water pipe, but they couldn't quench their thirst even after drinking a pot of water. Later, they put ice cubes in the cold boiled water and poured it into their parched throats constantly. When the soda water pipe was installed, when Chen Liwen climbed down from the high steel frame, he coughed in his dry throat and coughed up a mouthful of blood. One early autumn morning, the early autumn wind blew down a few newly withered yellow leaves, roaring and swirling a cloud of dust in the air on the road with crisscrossing steel frames of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. I met Chen Liwen in the small office of the pipe fitting team. I asked him what happened to the vomiting of blood in July. He put his hands on his waist, revealing a steel-like chest from the open canvas shirt, shaking his full beard, squinting his eyes and smiling honestly, saying to me, "Look at me, what kind of illness can I have? The doctor in the factory insisted on listening and looking at me again and again. It turned out that nothing was wrong, just a small problem with the blood vessels in my throat." Later, we went to the steelmaking workshop together. The roar of various machines, air pipes, tar spraying pipes, and fierce furnaces made it difficult to hear each other even when speaking face to face. Looking into the steel furnace with a pair of blue glasses worn by furnace workers, the steel about to be tapped glittered golden light, like a huge golden spring gushing from the spring. Chen Liwen led me inside and pointed to me beside a tap of tap water. This is the soda water pipe they installed for the furnace workers. Now, those workers who are busy in front of the furnace only need to turn around and turn on the tap. Whenever they want to drink soda, they can just drink it to their heart's content. Chen Liwen looked at me, smiling as innocently as a child, took off the protective helmet from his head, bowed his tall body, opened his mouth and waited under the tap, and then turned on the tap all at once, his face full of beard splashed with water droplets… After drinking, he smiled and pointed to the tap for me to drink as well. I learned from him and drank several mouthfuls at once. Then, he leaned to my ear and asked me, "Is it sweet?" I said, "It's sweet!"

    金水泉边的陈立文
    白原
    遮天盖地，烟雾腾腾，穿梭般的火车来往在各个厂房之间，熊熊的炼钢炉里的烈火，机器的震耳欲聋的轰响，天车隆隆，钢花飞溅……。在鞍山钢铁公司那一群群炼钢工人中间，有一个工人叫陈立文，高大的个子，敞开上衣的钮扣穿着一身粘满油污的白帆布工作服，黑里透红的大方脸上长着一脸络腮胡。不知是因为帽子本来就太小，还是因为身躯高大的原故，头上戴的一顶防护帽显得那么小，看来简直使人觉得有点别具风趣。这是一个乐观的人，虽然已经四十五岁了，在生活当中经历过许多的艰难，可是眯起眼睛笑起来，简直就像小孩一般的天真。陈立文是个配管工人。到过炼钢厂的人大概都知道，在鞍山钢铁公司的炼钢厂里，有无数大大小小用钢铁铸成的管道：煤气管，蒸汽管，风管，水管，焦油管……大的差不多像一般工厂的烟囱那么大，有的笔直、有的弯弯曲曲地架在空中的横横直直的钢架上，就像无数攀援在瓜棚上的瓜藤，纵横交错地通向各个厂房，通向一座座高大的炼钢炉上。对于炼钢厂来说，没有这许多管道就炼不成钢，而安装、修理、架设这无数大大小小的管道，不能不是一项巨大的、宏伟的工程。陈立文他们所干的就是这一行。
    不用说，能够干这一行的人，那可不简单呵！可是在炼钢工人当中，有一些小伙子却不愿意干这一行。在他们的心目中，干这个，不如开天车那么神气，更不如炉前工那么威武，那么为人注目。当然，爱好社会主义、共产主义的荣誉，有什么可非难的呢？在钢架纵横、钢水辉映的上空，被飞溅的钢花簇拥着，架着隆隆的天车在空中来回飞翔，那的确令人羡慕；在烈火熊熊的炼钢炉前，手执钢钎，看着滚滚钢水由自己亲手炼成，为人们铸就美好的生活，难道能不感到光荣和自豪？因此，音乐家为我们的天车工谱写抒情的歌曲，新时代的诗人为人们写下许多歌颂炉前工人的诗篇。可是，当我们的歌手在世间传播荣誉的时候，同样也应该注意到无数曾经是默默无闻的那些不显眼的人。
    譬如说，当一个个被烈火和钢水映得满脸红光的炉前工人头戴防护帽，手执钢钎在和烈火翻滚、钢水沸腾的炼钢炉搏斗的时候，炼钢炉出钢的钟声响起，一个个巨大的钢水罐装满钢水；当天车工架着天车吊着一罐罐钢水在空中来去的时候，在不被人们注目的地方，在一片响声隆隆、热火沸腾的厂房外面，冬天的北风在呼啸，严寒使滴水成冰，正在一条管道边忙碌着的，就是那些配管工人。那是一条通往厂房的水管，因为裂了一个口子，水正哗哗地往外漏。正是那些配管工人，他们顶着呼啸的北风，冒着刺骨的严寒，在抢修那一条裂口的水管。从裂了口的水管漏到水沟里的水越来越深，需要有人站到水里才行。于是，从那一伙年青的配管工人当中走出一个身躯高大的中年人来，一下子跳进没膝的冰水里，默默地站着干了两三个钟头。许多小伙子要下去替换他，可是他说：“你们骨头还软，经不住冻”，一个也不让下去替换。等到把水管的裂口抢修好，他从水里爬上来的时候，两只棉裤的裤筒已经硬崩崩地结成了冰，就像是石雕铜铸的一样了。这是谁呵？这就是那个配管班的班长陈立文。
    1958年春天，配管工人们正在安设一条地下管道。有一天，他们在管道通过的地方碰到一个埋在地下的大洋灰垛，镐头挖不开，使大锤打，一锤也只打落那么一小块，打了整整半天，洋灰垛还是没有被打掉。那天早上，陈立文因为牙疼到医院去看牙，没有在工地上。到了医院，牙科医生一看，牙非拔不行，倒也简单，坐在牙科诊室的那把设备齐全的转椅上，任由医生手上的钳子、镊子在嘴里摆弄一阵，最后一下子也就把牙拔下来了。医生用镊子夹着一小块蘸上碘酒的棉花塞到牙槽里，对陈立文说：“好好含着，过两个钟头再把它吐出来。”这一下可别扭了，就像什么东西梗在喉咙里一样不自在，而且刚才把牙拔下来的时候，因为打了麻药针，倒不觉得疼，现在却开始发作起来了。陈立文带着一股别扭劲回到工厂，已经是下班吃午饭的时候。他饭不想吃，跑到工地一看，班上的人们还在使劲一锤锤在打那个洋灰垛，而洋灰垛却仍然一动也不动。陈立文叫大家收工回去吃饭，他一个人留在那里看工具。大家一走，他一个人坐在洋灰垛旁边，牙槽里越来越疼，调眼看看那个洋灰垛，好像也在故意和他闹别扭样。陈立文蓦地站起来，双手抡起大锤对着洋灰垛一股劲打下去，几下子就使洋灰垛裂成了几大块。等到工人们吃完饭回来一看，洋灰垛没有了，只见陈立文两手托着腮帮坐在一个土墩上，半个脸都浮肿起来了。那时候开始兴插红旗。安设地下管道完工以后，人们就给陈立文插了一面大红旗。接着，陈立文的配管班接受了一项安装喷焦油管的任务，从空中往平炉架设一千多米长的喷焦油管。这一项工程完工以后，使每一炉钢水的冶炼时间缩短半个小时。于是，钢厂的跃进产量就有保证地按计划完成了。
    跃进一年又一年，中国大陆上激荡着社会主义大建设的浪潮。日日夜夜，在鞍山钢铁公司的上空烟雾滚滚，红光满天。中国人民的脚步声震动了世界。满怀光明的人民欢欣鼓舞，那些灵魂阴暗的爬虫们暴跳如雷。然而陈立文只管走自己的路，全心全意地把自己的生命贡献给人类的伟大的理想。今年7月间，陈立文的配管班为炉前的炼钢工人们安装了一条汽水管。在炼钢厂的炼钢车间里，炉前的炼钢工人们手执钢钎，在烈火熊熊，钢花飞溅的炼钢炉前日日夜夜进行紧张的劳动，身上还不能不穿着厚厚的帆布工作服，虽然吹风机对着他们呜呜地吹个不停，还是被烤得像在一片火海里一样，在炎热的夏天，那就更是热得不行。本来，工厂里为高温车间的工人们准备着解渴的汽水，但是需要工人们用铁壶一壶壶从汽水厂打到车间里来。为了让炉前工人们能够经常不断地喝到更充足的汽水，陈立文的配管班就来安装一条专门给他们输送汽水的水管。汽水管从汽水厂安装起，沿着炼钢车间顶上的钢架，一直通到车间的炼钢炉前。陈立文带领着两个配管班的年青小伙子爬在高高的钢架上，底下是炼钢炉的熊熊的烈火，周围是一片烟雾滚滚，钢水沸腾的高空。开始，他们每天带着一壶凉开水爬到钢架上去安装水管，可是不住地把一壶水喝完还是解不了渴。后来，他们把冰块放到凉开水里，不住地往干渴的喉咙里浇。等到把汽水管装好，陈立文从高高的钢架上爬下来的时候，从干燥的喉咙里咳嗽了一声，竟咳出一口血来。一个初秋的早晨，初起的秋风吹落了几片刚刚枯萎的黄叶，在鞍山钢铁公司的钢架纵横的道路上呼啸着，翻卷着一片漫天的烟尘，我在配管班的那间小小的办公室里遇见了陈立文。我问他7月间那一回吐血究竟是怎么回事。他两只手往腰间一插，从敞开的帆布上衣里露出一块钢铁般的胸膛，抖动着满脸的络腮胡，眯起眼睛憨笑着对我说：“你看我这人还能有什么病？工厂里的大夫非要我给他听了又听，看了又看，原来什么事也没有，只是喉咙里的血管出了点小毛病。”后来我们一同到了炼钢车间，各种各样的机器、风管、喷焦油管、熊熊的炉火的轰响，互相对着脸说话都很难听得清。用一副炉前工人的蓝眼镜往炼钢炉里看去，就要出炉的钢水金光闪闪，就像汹涌着从泉眼里冒出来的一股巨大的金泉。陈立文领我往里走，在一个自来水管的水龙头旁边指给我看，这就是他们为炉前工人们安装的汽水管。现在，那些在炉前忙碌的工人们只要一转身把水龙头扭开，什么时候想喝汽水就只管尽情地喝。陈立文看着我，好像小孩一般天真地笑着，把防护帽从头上抓下来，躬着高大的身躯，张嘴等在水龙头下面，然后一下子把水龙头扭开，满脸的胡子溅满了水星……喝完，他笑着向我指指水龙头让我也去喝。我学着他的样子一下子喝了好几口。然后，他凑到我的耳朵边问我：“甜不甜？”我说：“甜呵！”
