    Conscientiously Run Small Synthetic Ammonia Plants
    Currently, there are hundreds of small synthetic ammonia fertilizer plants being built or already completed across the country. This is a new force to support agriculture, accelerate the realization of technological transformation, and promote increased grain production. We must conscientiously run these factories well and seek greater development on the basis of continuously summarizing experience and continuously consolidating and improving them. Nitrogen fertilizer is one of the essential nutrients for plant growth and reproduction. If grain crops lack nitrogen fertilizer, the protein content of the grains will be significantly reduced. If oil crops lack nitrogen fertilizer, the oil content will decrease. If cotton lacks nitrogen fertilizer, the fibers will become shorter. Therefore, using chemical methods to produce nitrogen fertilizer and applying it to the fields to supplement the deficiency of natural fertilizers is of great significance for promoting crop growth and agricultural production.
    Vigorously developing synthetic ammonia plants and producing synthetic ammonia is a good way to produce nitrogen fertilizer. However, the technology for producing synthetic ammonia is quite complex. Building a synthetic ammonia fertilizer plant with an annual output of 50,000 tons requires an investment of about 1,400 yuan per ton, 0.4 tons of steel, and a construction period of more than two years. On the other hand, building a small synthetic ammonia plant with an annual output of 800 tons allows for local manufacturing of equipment, requiring less investment and steel than a large plant. It can be built and put into production in just two or three months. Moreover, small factories can be close to rural areas and coal-producing areas, which allows for both local sourcing of materials and local sales. Therefore, developing small synthetic ammonia fertilizer plants has its special significance for supporting agricultural technological transformation.
    So, how can we run small synthetic ammonia fertilizer plants well? The news about the Jinan Chemical Fertilizer Plant published in this newspaper today provides us with very beneficial experience. That is to run small factories as if they were large factories, paying attention to the technical complexity of the synthetic ammonia industry as a whole, and also attaching great importance to the complexity of each link in the entire process of construction, installation, and production, and conscientiously and carefully doing the specific work of each link well. Therefore, since this factory was put into production in June of this year, production has been proceeding normally, and the daily output of liquid ammonia from a single unit has been stable at 1,200 kilograms, and the equipment output has reached more than 90% in less than four months after being put into production. In contrast, some comrades in some factories did not pay enough attention to the specific difficulties, thinking that "we have experience in running large factories, so what problems could there be in running small factories?" They did not see the particularity of small factories, and as a result, some equipment that was not precise enough or did not meet the specifications was also installed, and the installation work was not carried out carefully enough. After being put into production, phenomena such as liquid leakage and gas escape, as well as other problems, appeared, which affected normal production.
    Objective facts have made a vivid comparison. Our current task is to very conscientiously do a series of specific tasks in each link of construction, installation, and production of small synthetic ammonia fertilizer plants. All regions should concentrate their main efforts, conscientiously run several factories well, set up models, and lay a good foundation for the greater development of the small synthetic ammonia industry.

### 认真办好小型合成氨厂

    认真办好小型合成氨厂
    目前全国各地正在建设和已经建成的小型合成氨氮肥厂约有几百座。这是一支支援农业加速实现技术改造，促进粮食增产的崭新的力量。我们要切切实实地办好这批工厂，在不断总结经验，不断巩固提高的基础上，再求更大的发展。氮肥是植物生长、繁殖的重要养料之一。粮食作物缺少了氮肥，籽粒含有的蛋白质成分就要显著减少。油料作物缺少氮肥，含油量就要下降。棉花缺少了氮肥，纤维就要变短。因此，采用化学方法制成氮肥，施用到田里去，以补自然肥料的不足，对促进农作物生长，促进农业增产，有重要的意义。
    大办合成氨厂，大造合成氨，是造氮肥的好办法。但是，生产合成氨的技术相当复杂，建设一座年产五万吨的合成氨氮肥厂，每吨投资需要一千四百元左右，需要钢材零点四吨，工期要两年以上。而建设一座年产八百吨的小型合成氨厂，设备可以就地制造，投资、钢材都比大厂少。只要两、三个月就可以建成投入生产。而且小厂可以接近农村、接近煤炭产地，既可以就地取材，又可以就地销售。因此，发展小型合成氨氮肥厂，对支援农业技术改造又有它的特殊意义。
    那么，怎样才能办好小型合成氨氮肥厂呢？本报今天发表的济南化学肥料厂的新闻，给我们提供了一个十分有益的经验。这就是要把小厂当做大厂来办，既要在总体上重视合成氨工业的技术复杂性，又要在施工、安装、生产的整个过程中，十分重视每一个环节的复杂性，认真细致地做好各个环节的具体工作。因而，这个厂在今年6月投入生产以后，生产一直正常进行，单机液氨日产量一直稳定在一千二百公斤，投入生产不到四个月，设备出力就达到了90％以上。与此相反，有些工厂的同志们由于对具体的困难没有足够的重视，认为“办大厂都有经验，办小厂还有什么问题？”没有看到小厂的特殊性，结果一些制造不够精密、不合规格的设备也安装上了，安装工作也进行得不细致，投入生产后就出现了漏液、跑气等现象，以及其它方面的问题，影响了正常生产。
    客观事实作出了生动的对比。当前我们的任务，就是要十分认真地做好小型合成氨氮肥厂的施工、安装、生产各个环节的一系列具体工作。各个地区都应当集中主要力量，认真办好几座工厂，树立样板，为小型合成氨工业的更大发展打好基础。
