    Harvest, Store, and Process Sweet Potatoes Well
    Sweet potatoes are a well-known high-yield grain crop and an important industrial raw material crop. This year, all parts of the country have been implementing the policy of both multiple planting for increased yields and high-yield for increased yields, and have strived to expand the planting area of ​​high-yield crops, planting many more sweet potatoes. At present, sweet potatoes are growing well in most areas, and a bumper harvest is in sight. Preparations should be made early, seize the opportunity to harvest, store, and process sweet potatoes well. This plays a significant role in increasing this year's grain output and arranging the people's lives.
    With the continuous development of agricultural production, the meaning of the word "harvest" is becoming richer. In the large-scale collective management of the people's communes, the harvest is no longer limited to taking from the field to the home, but should include links such as storage and preservation. The harvest of some crops even extends to preliminary processing. Grain crops such as corn, rice, and millet are easiest to harvest, but after warehousing, they must be turned and dried in time. Economic crops such as sugar cane, sugar beet, tobacco leaves, tea, fruits, and medicinal materials must be processed immediately after harvest, otherwise it is almost the same as leaving them in the field. Even if there is a bumper harvest, it does not necessarily result in a rich harvest.
    As a kind of grain, sweet potatoes are very delicate. They contain a lot of water, are soft in texture, and are not easy to preserve. It is a thermophilic crop, but matures late. After being unearthed, it is easily damaged by frost or cold air. Its skin is very thin, and if it is scratched during harvesting, it easily rots. These characteristics indicate that sweet potatoes are different from other grain crops. Harvesting should be done carefully, storage should be carefully considered, and processing should be timely.
    Through our years of careful cultivation, sweet potato yields have increased year by year. Generally, the yield per mu is one to two thousand jin, and some can reach about ten thousand jin. In the era of small-scale peasant economy, each farmer harvested a small amount of sweet potatoes, and scattered storage, preservation, consumption, and processing were simple. In the era of agricultural cooperatives, collective production and scattered living meant that most of the sweet potatoes harvested were still distributed to households for self-processing. The people's commune is the organizer of collective production and the organizer of collective life. The vast majority of sweet potatoes harvested by each production team are collectively stored, preserved, processed, and used. A production team plants hundreds of mu of sweet potatoes and has to process hundreds of thousands or even millions of jin of fresh potatoes. This is a big matter, and it takes a lot of effort to do it well. Last year, the First Management District of Shangning Commune in Suining County, Sichuan Province, harvested 2.29 million jin of sweet potatoes, processed part of them, and sixteen production teams cellared hundreds of thousands of jin of fresh potatoes. The natural loss rate was only 1.25%. There were still fresh potatoes to eat until June of this year. The cadres and commune members of this management district understood the nature and characteristics of sweet potatoes and put in the necessary effort in the links of harvesting, storing, managing, and using them. They first focused on timely harvesting. Harvesting sweet potatoes too early will reduce the yield, and harvesting too late is prone to frost damage. The experience of the First Management District of Shangning Commune is "timely and slightly early, to ensure meticulousness with earliness." Starting a little earlier provides ample time to harvest carefully and thoroughly, and allows for early land clearing and plowing to ensure timely sowing of autumn crops. In order to harvest "timely and slightly early," they concentrated their efforts to rush the harvest, harvesting early-planted crops early and late-planted crops late, and improved the harvesting tools, improving harvesting efficiency. They mostly dig potatoes on sunny days. On sunny days, the respiratory function of the potato tubers is vigorous, more moisture evaporates, and the skin dries quickly, making it difficult for bacteria to invade, so they can be put into the cellar on the same day.
    For many years, farmers have mainly planted sweet potatoes for fresh consumption, accumulating rich experience in storing and preserving fresh potatoes. The key to storing fresh potatoes well is to have a good potato cellar, plus appropriate protection and management, which can ensure that the sweet potatoes do not rot for ten months. Last year, the Fourth Production Team of the First Management District of Bayi Commune in Lezhi County, Sichuan Province, built a potato cellar, exposed it to sunlight for more than a month, and disinfected it with smoke from Chen Ai and cypress branches, storing 4,000 jin of fresh potatoes, which did not spoil until June of this year. The First Production Team of the same management district had a potato cellar that was dug in a hurry when the potatoes were harvested, and no technical treatment was carried out, and nearly one-third of the fresh potatoes rotted. Now the time for harvesting sweet potatoes is not far away. All people's communes that have planted sweet potatoes should immediately dig good potato cellars, carefully repair the original potato cellars, and assign special personnel to be responsible for storage, preservation, processing, and other tasks.
    Several years of experience have told us that the fundamental way to prevent large-scale rotting losses of sweet potatoes is to process them: slicing, drying, and processing into flour. The commune processes sweet potatoes into sweet potato chips and sweet potato flour, which is convenient for preservation and also convenient for eating coarse grains in a refined way, adjusting the diet of the commune members. According to the national plan, the commune processes some sweet potatoes into sweet potato chips, starch, alcohol, maltose, etc., which can increase the supply of non-staple foods in the market and provide some raw materials for certain industrial sectors. In concentrated sweet potato production areas, a portion of fresh potatoes and seed potatoes can be stored according to actual needs, and most of them should be sliced and dried. Each commune should prepare processing tools such as slicing, grinding, and drying based on the principle of making do with whatever is available, combining indigenous and foreign methods. The industrial, grain, and commercial departments should assist the commune in doing a good job in sweet potato processing as much as possible.
    Sweet potato stems and potato tendons can be ground into flour, used for brewing wine, and boiling sugar; sweet potato leaf tips and potato stems can also be made into dried vegetables and pickles; sweet potato vines are good feed. In the past, people did not pay much attention to the use of sweet potato by-products, and it was a pity to use a large number of potato stems, potato roots, and potato vines as fertilizer or fuel. They should be comprehensively utilized to give full play to their role.
    After the sweet potatoes are harvested, attention should be paid to selecting and retaining seed potatoes, which has a direct relationship to ensuring the sweet potato planting area next year, promoting improved varieties, and eliminating the black spot disease of sweet potatoes. High-quality seed potatoes should be stored in special cellars, and the most experienced commune members should be designated to be responsible for storage, regular inspections, and strict prevention of rot.

### 把甘薯收好、藏好、处理好

    把甘薯收好、藏好、处理好
    甘薯是著名的高产粮食作物，又是重要的工业原料作物。今年，全国各地贯彻多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针，努力扩大高产作物的播种面积，多种了许多甘薯。目前，多数地区的甘薯生长良好，丰收在望。应该早作准备，抓紧时机，把甘薯收好、藏好和处理好。这对于增加今年的粮食产量，安排好人民的生活，有着重大的作用。
    随着农业生产的不断发展，收获二字的涵义是更加丰富了。在大规模集体经营的人民公社中，收获不再限于从地里拿到家里，而应该加上贮藏、保管等环节，一部分农作物的收获甚至要延长到初步加工。玉米、水稻、谷子等粮食作物最容易收获，但仓储之后，还要及时进行翻晒。甘蔗、甜菜、烟叶、茶叶、水果、药材等经济作物，收获回来，更要马上处理，否则简直和留在地里差不多，即使丰产了，也不一定得到丰收的结果。
    作为一种粮食，甘薯是很娇气的。它含水分多，组织柔软，不易保管。它是一种喜温作物，但成熟较迟，出土以后，遇有霜冻或冷空气，容易冻伤。它的表皮很薄，收刨时如被擦伤，容易腐烂。这些特点说明了，甘薯跟别的粮食作物不同，收刨要很细心，贮藏要很注意，加工要很及时。
    经过我们多年的精心培育，甘薯产量逐年上升。一般亩产一、二千斤，多的可达万斤左右。在小农经济时代，每个农户收获少量甘薯，分散收藏、保管、食用、加工，事情是简单的。农业合作社时代，集体生产，分散生活，甘薯收获以后，大部分还是分给各户自行处理。人民公社是集体生产的组织者，又是集体生活的组织者。各生产队收获的甘薯，绝大多数集体收藏、保管、加工、使用。一个生产队种上几百亩甘薯，要处理几十万斤甚至上百万斤鲜薯。这是一件大事情，要下一番大工夫才能作到好处。四川遂宁县上宁公社第一管理区去年收获了二百二十九万斤甘薯，加工处理了一部分，十六个生产小队窖藏了几十万斤鲜薯，自然损耗率只有1.25％，到今年6月还有鲜薯吃。这个管理区的干部、社员把甘薯的脾性、特点摸熟了，在收、藏、管、用等环节上，都用了必要的工夫。他们首先抓紧适时收挖这一环节。甘薯收挖过早会降低产量，收挖过晚容易遭受冻害。上宁公社第一管理区的经验是“适时稍早，以早保细”。稍早一点，就有充裕时间收细拣净，并且可以早腾地，早犁地，保证秋播作物适时播种。为了“适时稍早”收挖，他们集中全力突击抢挖，早栽的早挖，迟栽的迟挖，并且改进了挖薯工具，提高了收挖效率。他们多在晴天挖薯，晴天薯块的呼吸功能旺盛，水分蒸发得多，表皮迅速干燥，病菌不易侵入，可以当天入窖。
    多少年来，农民种甘薯以食用鲜薯为主，积累了贮藏、保管鲜薯的丰富经验。藏好鲜薯的关键是要有一个好薯窖，加上适当的保护管理，可以保证甘薯十个月不烂。四川乐至县八一公社一管理区第四生产队去年打了一个薯窖，日照一个多月，又用陈艾、柏枝烟熏消毒，贮藏四千斤鲜薯，至今年6月不坏。同一管理区的第一生产队有一个薯窖，是在收薯时候赶挖成的，没有进行任何技术处理，鲜薯烂掉近三分之一。现在离收获甘薯的时间已经不远，凡是种了甘薯的人民公社，应该立即挖好薯窖，认真检修原有薯窖，指定专人负责贮藏、保管、加工等项工作。
    几年来的经验告诉我们，防止大量甘薯腐烂损失的根本办法是进行加工：切片、晒干和加工制粉。公社把甘薯加工成薯干、薯粉，既便于保管，又便于粗粮细吃，调剂社员的伙食；公社按照国家计划，把一部分甘薯加工成薯干、淀粉、酒精、饴糖等等，又能增加市场的副食品供应，为某些工业部门提供一部分原料。甘薯集中产区，可以根据实际需要贮藏一部分鲜薯和种薯，大部分应该切片晒干。各个公社要根据因陋就简、土洋结合的原则，准备切片、磨粉、烘干等加工工具。工业、粮食、商业部门要尽量协助公社做好甘薯加工工作。
    甘薯的薯柄、薯筋可以磨粉、酿酒、熬糖，薯叶尖、薯柄又可以制成干菜、咸菜，薯藤是很好的饲料。过去人们不很注意利用甘薯的副产物，把大量的薯柄、薯根、薯藤用作肥料或燃料，是很可惜的，应该进行综合利用，充分发挥它们的作用。
    甘薯收获以后，要注意选留薯种，这对于保证明年的甘薯种植面积，推广优良品种和消灭甘薯的黑斑病害，都有直接的关系。优良种薯要专窖储藏，指定最有经验的社员专门负责保管，定期检查，严防腐烂。
