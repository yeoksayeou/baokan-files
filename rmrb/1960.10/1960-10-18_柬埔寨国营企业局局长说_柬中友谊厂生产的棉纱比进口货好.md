Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 17th. According to reports in the local press, the Director of the State Enterprise Bureau of the Cambodian Ministry of Planning, Chen Jinhong, told reporters that all owners of textile factories in Cambodia believe that the quality of cotton yarn produced by the Cambodia-China Friendship Textile Factory is better than imported goods, and the price is also cheaper.

    In the past, all cotton yarn used in Cambodia was imported from abroad, amounting to approximately 700 to 800 tons per year, mainly from Pakistan and Japan.

    Chen Jinhong said that the Cambodian Royal Cooperative Bureau has ordered 100 tons of cotton yarn from this textile factory for distribution to the cooperatives under its jurisdiction.

    According to newspaper reports, the price of cotton yarn produced by the Cambodia-China Friendship Textile Factory is only about 300 riel per bale, while the price of Pakistani cotton yarn is more than 350 riel per bale. Since the sale of Cambodian-produced cotton yarn on the domestic market, the price of Pakistani cotton yarn has quickly fallen to 320 riel per bale.

    柬埔寨国营企业局局长说
    柬中友谊厂生产的棉纱比进口货好
    新华社金边17日电　据这里的报纸报道，柬埔寨计划部国营企业局局长陈金洪对报界说：柬埔寨国内纺织厂所有主认为，柬中友谊纺织厂生产的棉纱质量比进口货好，价格也比它便宜。
    过去，柬埔寨用的棉纱全部从国外进口，每年大约达七百至八百吨，主要是从巴基斯坦和日本进口。
    陈金洪说，柬埔寨皇家合作局已经向这个纺织厂订了一百吨棉纱以便分发给它所辖的合作社。
    据报纸报道，柬中友谊纺织厂所生产的棉纱每包价格只有三百瑞尔左右，而巴基斯坦棉纱的价格却在每包三百五十瑞尔以上。自从柬埔寨自己生产的棉纱在国内市场上销售以来，巴基斯坦棉纱的价格很快地下跌为每包三百二十瑞尔。
