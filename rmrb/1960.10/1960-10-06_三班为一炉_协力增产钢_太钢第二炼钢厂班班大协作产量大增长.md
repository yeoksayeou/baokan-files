Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, October 5th: The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company's Second Steelmaking Plant has launched a fervent competition centered on "Three Shifts as One Furnace, Great Mutual Collaboration" among its furnaces, driving each other to catch up and surpass. In this competition, workers have universally established an overall concept of doing everything to produce more and better steel. Each shift and group closely cooperates, leading to a comprehensive surge in production. From September 1st to 29th, the daily steel production level increased by 61.36% compared to the same period in August. The quality of steel has significantly improved, and the consumption of pig iron per ton of steel has also been greatly reduced.

The competition format of "Three Shifts as One Furnace, Great Mutual Collaboration" originated at the plant's No. 7 furnace. The 21 young people in the three shifts of this furnace were apprentices at No. 11 furnace a few months ago. Based on humbly learning the blowing techniques of the master workers at No. 11 furnace, and in light of the strong continuity and rapid turnover of converter steelmaking, they proposed the slogan "Everyone Grasp Blowing, Everyone Manage Maintenance, Three Shifts as One Furnace." They also established a "Four Exchanges" system between groups: exchanging information, exchanging key points, exchanging tasks, and exchanging measures. Not only is the shift handover clear, but they also create conditions for each other. For example, the Group B team cleans the slag and prepares the tools during their own shift, so that Group C can start continuous blowing as soon as they come to work. In order to shorten smelting and turnover time, they work closely with the pig iron furnace, ingot stripping, crane, and bricklaying operations. When others are too busy, they organize furnace workers to help, thereby halving the turnover time. Due to "Three Shifts as One Furnace, Great Mutual Collaboration," the No. 7 furnace has been leading in all indicators since May of this year and has won the company's Red Flag in the Ten-Furnace Competition.

Zhao Lizhi, the Director of the Industry Department of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who is deeply involved in leading production on the front line, and the plant's Party committee, jointly studied and summarized the practices of the No. 7 furnace. They believe that their experience is an important way to mobilize workers to rapidly increase steel production. In September, after all furnaces and teams in the plant formulated plans and measures to increase production and practice economy, they immediately launched a competition to "Learn from No. 7, Catch up with No. 7, and Surpass No. 7." The shifts and groups of each furnace formed observation groups and technical performance teams to learn and perform in front of the No. 7 furnace, quickly forming a wave of catching up and surpassing each other. From mid-September to now, Nos. 1, 3, 5, 10, and 11 furnaces have caught up with or surpassed No. 7 furnace. In the furnace-to-furnace comparison competition in early September, No. 3 furnace jumped from third place to first place.

With the continuous emergence of new pacesetters, leading cadres promptly summarized new experiences, further enriching and developing the experience of "Three Shifts as One Furnace." The master workers of No. 11 furnace, who have always patiently helped No. 7 furnace with their operating techniques, also earnestly learned the advanced experiences of No. 7 furnace in the competition. They established the concept of shift-for-shift unity on the basis of everyone-for-one, improving the pre-shift meetings and furnace-front meetings, so that each member of the team has clear responsibilities and works in an orderly manner. Due to the serious learning and development of the advanced experience of "Three Shifts as One Furnace" from No. 7 furnace, the daily output level of No. 11 furnace has been steadily increasing. In mid-September, the shifts achieved high production and high quality, overfulfilled the plan, and increased production by 42.5% compared to the first ten days of the month, winning the plant's overall competition championship and the company's Ten-Furnace Competition championship.

### 三班为一炉　协力增产钢  太钢第二炼钢厂班班大协作产量大增长

    三班为一炉　协力增产钢
    太钢第二炼钢厂班班大协作产量大增长
    据新华社太原5日电　太原钢铁公司第二炼钢厂以“三班为一炉，互相大协作”为中心内容，在炉与炉之间展开了你追我赶的竞赛热潮。在这场竞赛中，职工们普遍树立一切为多出钢、出好钢的整体观念，各班组紧密配合，使生产全面高涨。9月1日至29日，钢的日产水平比8月份同期提高61.36％；钢的质量有显著提高；每炼一吨钢的生铁消耗也大大降低。
    “三班为一炉、互相大协作”的竞赛形式，始创于这个厂的七号炉。这个炉三班二十一个人都是一些青年人，几个月前还在十一号炉当徒工。他们在虚心学习十一号炉老师傅吹炼技术的基础上，又针对转炉生产连续性强、周转快的特点，提出“人人抓吹炼、个个管维护、三班为一炉”的口号，并且建立了组与组交情况、交关键、交任务、交措施的“四交”制度。不只交接班清楚，而且互相创造条件。如乙班小组在自己班上就清完渣、准备好工具，使丙班一上班就能连续吹炼。为了缩短冶炼和周转时间，他们和化铁炉、脱锭、吊车、砌砖各工种紧密配合。旁人忙不过来，他们就组织炉前工去帮助，因此使周转时间缩短了一半。七号炉由于“三班为一炉、互相大协作”，今年5月以来各项指标遥遥领先，获得了公司十炉竞赛红旗。
    在这里深入第一线领导生产的中共太原市委工业部长赵力之和厂党委共同研究和总结了七号炉的作法后，认为他们的经验是发动职工迅速提高钢产量的重要途径。9月份，全厂各炉和班组制定出增产节约计划和措施后，立即掀起了“学七号、赶七号、超七号”的竞赛热潮。各炉的班、组纷纷组成观摩团、技术表演队到七号炉前学习、表演，很快形成了“一旗高举万旗扬”的你追我赶热潮。从9月中旬到现在，全厂已有一、三、五、十、十一号炉赶上或超过了七号炉。三号炉在9月上旬炉与炉评比竞赛中，由第三名一跃而为第一名。
    随着新标兵的不断出现，领导干部及时总结新的经验，进一步充实和发展了“三班为一炉”的经验。一向在操作技术上耐心帮助七号炉的十一号炉老师傅们，在竞赛中又认真学习七号炉的先进经验。他们把班班为一炉建立在人人为一炉的基础上，健全了班前会议和炉前会议，使小组成员人人责任明确，工作起来有条不紊。十一号炉由于认真学习并发展了七号炉“三班为一炉”的先进经验，日产水平稳定上升。9月中旬，班班作到了高产优质，超额完成了计划，产量比上旬提高42.5％，夺得全厂竞赛冠军和全公司十炉竞赛冠军。（附图片）
