Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 14th -- The Cuban government yesterday presented three notes to the US government, strongly protesting the recent aggression and subversion activities carried out by the US government against Cuba, and protesting its sheltering of Cuban war criminals who attacked Cuban diplomatic representatives in the United States. These notes were handed to the US Ambassador to Cuba by Cuban Acting Foreign Minister Carlos Olivares last night.

    The first note states that the Revolutionary Government lodges the "most serious and vehement protest" against the piratical flight of a US four-engine aircraft on September 29 over the Escambray Mountains in Las Villas Province, and the dropping of large quantities of weapons by parachute to counter-revolutionary groups.

    The note points out that this act of infringing upon Cuban territory and supporting counter-revolutionary groups is sufficient to "prove that certain US dignitaries and politicians openly and brazenly provide protection and assistance to war criminals who insist on dragging our country backward, and they underestimate the invincible force of our people's will to safeguard sovereignty and steadily advance the revolution."

    Another note "expresses the most indignation and vehement protest against the armed expeditionary force that landed on the coast of Oriente Province on the 5th of this month, which came from Miami, Florida, in the United States." The note points out that the origin of the seized weapons, the departure point of the expedition, the identities of Cuban counter-revolutionaries – all of whom recently resided in the United States – and American citizens Anthony Zarba, Paul Hughes, and Alan Thompson who participated in this expedition, as well as the instigation by Americans managing Swan Radio, all prove that "the aforementioned expedition is another link in a long chain of aggression planned, funded, and instigated by large economic interest groups that dominate American national life." After listing a series of US aggressions against Cuba, the note points out, "These acts of aggression blatantly violate the most fundamental principles of international law." The note warns that the fact that these invaders were arrested in a matter of a few hours shows those people that there should be no doubt about the unwavering determination of the Cuban people to oppose any foreign aggression.

    The third note from the Cuban government protests against the US authorities for sheltering Cuban war criminals who carried out criminal attacks on the Cuban Consulate in Miami.

    The note points out that on the 13th of this month, the Cuban Consulate in Miami was attacked and robbed by many bandits armed with pistols and iron rulers. Consul General Avilado Leon Blanco and all the consulate staff were violated and abused, important documents were taken away, and the consulate's building and furniture were damaged. At that time, not a single American policeman appeared in or near the consulate to provide the necessary protection.

    The note points out that "the Cuban Revolutionary Government lodges the strongest and most indignant protest against these frequent incidents which have occurred under the suspicious connivance or open collusion of the US authorities."

    古巴政府照会抗议美国的侵略颠覆活动
    古巴人民反侵略决心坚定不移
    新华社哈瓦那14日电　古巴政府昨晚向美国政府提出三个照会，强烈抗议美国政府最近对古巴进行的侵略和颠覆活动，抗议它包庇对古巴驻美国外交代表进行袭击的古巴战犯。这些照会是由古巴代理外交部长卡洛斯·奥利瓦雷斯在昨天晚上交给美国驻古巴大使的。
    第一个照会说，革命政府对于一架美国四引擎飞机9月29日在拉斯维利亚斯省埃斯坎布拉伊山区上空进行海盗式的飞行，并用降落伞给反革命集团投下大量武器的行为提出“最严正和强烈的抗议”。
    照会指出，这一侵犯古巴领土的行为和支持反革命集团的活动足以“证明某些美国当权人士和政治家公开地和放肆地对坚持把我国往后拖的战争罪犯提供保护和帮助，他们低估了我国人民维护主权完整和稳步推进革命的意志的不可战胜的力量。”
    另一个照会“对于本月5日在奥连特省海岸登陆的武装远征队是来自美国佛罗里达州的迈阿密，表示最愤慨和强烈的抗议。”照会指出，被缴获的武器的来源、远征队的出发地点、古巴反革命分子——这些人最近都住在美国——和参加这一远征的美国公民安东尼·扎尔巴、保罗·休斯和阿兰·汤普森的身份的证明以及经管天鹅电台的美国人的煽风点火，都证明了“上述的远征是统治美国国家生活的大经济利益集团所策划的、资助和煽动的一长列侵略的链条的又一个环节。”照会在列举美国对古巴进行的一系列的侵略事实后指出，“这些侵略事实明目张胆地违反了国际法的最基本的原则。”照会警告说，在短短的几小时内便逮捕了这些入侵者，这一事实向那些人表明，对于古巴人民反对任何外国侵略的坚定不移的决心不容有任何怀疑。
    古巴政府的第三个照会抗议美国当局庇护对古巴驻迈阿密领事馆进行罪恶袭击的古巴战争罪犯。
    照会指出，本月13日，古巴驻迈阿密领事馆受到以手枪和铁尺武装起来的许多匪徒的袭击和抢劫。总领事阿维拉多·莱昂·布兰科和领事馆全体人员遭到了侵犯和虐待，重要的文件被劫走，领事馆的建筑和家具遭到了破坏。当时，没有一个美国警察出现在领事馆及其附近给予应有的保护。
    照会指出，“古巴革命政府对这些在美国当局可疑的纵容态度或者说是公开的勾结下所发生的如此频繁的事件，提出最强烈和最愤慨的抗议”。
