    新华社金边8日电　柬埔寨在中国帮助下第一次生产了胶合板。自从9月23日以来，由中国援助建设的西哈努克—周恩来胶合板工厂已在试验性生产阶段生产了大约一千张胶合板。
    9月27日，柬埔寨王国首相福·波伦曾率领政府官员参观了这座工厂，观看了试验性生产。10月5日，柬埔寨各省省长根据计划部的倡议，也参观了这座工厂。
    这座胶合板工厂是中国帮助柬埔寨建设的四座工厂之一，它从去年初开始修建，在今年初完工。随后，安装了中国制造的机器，在9月间开始进行试验性生产。生产能力为每年九十万平方米，全部原料可以在柬埔寨就地取得。
    这座工厂的副厂长昨天对记者说，第一批生产出来的胶合板的质量很好，已用来制造桌子和箱子；还制成了五百块黑板，以满足柬埔寨边境地区扫盲的需要。
  这位副厂长告诉记者，这个厂在进行基本建设期间，工地上每天雇用一千二百多名柬埔寨工人，有几百名工人在中国技术人员的指导下学会了一些专门技术，成了熟练工人。其中，有一百多名现在已经列入生产上的熟练工人名单中，并且正在中国专家的帮助下学习开机器和制造胶合板。
  　他衷心赞扬中国专家们的工作。他说，他们很勤劳刻苦。他们在工作中有高度的责任感。柬埔寨工人对中国专家在教他们学技术时的耐心和无保留的态度表示感激。他还说，中国专家同柬埔寨厂长和其它人员之间的关系非常好。
