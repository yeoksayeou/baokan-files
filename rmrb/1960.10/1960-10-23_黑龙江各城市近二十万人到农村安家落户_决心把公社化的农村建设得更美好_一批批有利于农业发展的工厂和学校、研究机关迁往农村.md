    Nearly 200,000 People From Various Cities in Heilongjiang Settle Down in Rural Areas
    Determined to Build the Communized Countryside Even Better
    Batches of Factories, Schools, and Research Institutes Beneficial to Agricultural Development Move to the Countryside

    (Our dispatch) Harbin – A high tide of going to the countryside and participating in rural construction is currently sweeping across cities in Heilongjiang Province. At present, nearly 200,000 cadres from government organs, workers from industrial and mining enterprises, teachers and students from universities and colleges, and personnel from scientific research institutions throughout the province are bringing proletarian ideology, science, culture, and technology to the countryside to settle down and work alongside the province's farmers to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, accelerating the construction of the countryside after communization.

    During the First Five-Year Plan period, with the support of the entire nation, Heilongjiang Province engaged in large-scale industrial development, transforming this region, which had a relatively weak industrial base with only oil, wine, rice, and flour processing industries and some machinery repair businesses, into one of the country's important industrial bases. Now, it possesses a strong material foundation and technological conditions to support agriculture and accelerate rural construction. Heilongjiang Province has fertile land, abundant resources, convenient transportation, and a good foundation for agricultural mechanization. The province's grain commercialization rate has reached approximately 50%, making it an important agricultural region for the country. It also has hundreds of millions of mu of fertile virgin land and tens of millions of mu of lush grassland, promising great prospects for agricultural development. In order to develop agriculture at high speed and accelerate rural construction, in recent months, Party organizations at all levels in Heilongjiang Province have universally conducted education among urban and rural people, focusing on agriculture as the foundation, vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and accelerating rural construction, further enhancing the political and ideological consciousness of the broad masses of people. Currently, a new atmosphere of loving the countryside, loving agricultural labor, and going to the countryside to participate in rural construction has been established in various cities. All government organs, industrial and mining enterprises, and schools throughout the province have extensively launched discussions, with people writing big-character posters and application letters, expressing their determination to work alongside farmers under the leadership of the Party, using their own hands and their own labor, to build the communized countryside even better.

    At present, batches of cadres, technicians, students, and urban residents in Heilongjiang Province are heading to the forefront of agricultural production with great enthusiasm. According to statistics, nearly 200,000 laborers have gone to the countryside. Among them, more than 16,000 are cadres at various levels, most of whom are familiar with grassroots work and have some experience in mass work. Some are county Party secretaries and county heads, while others are leading cadres from enterprise departments. Among the more than 10,000 laborers who went down from Qiqihar City, more than 1,600 are cadres at various levels. After arriving in the countryside, some have taken on leadership positions at the grassroots level, while others have become commune members. More than 2,300 technicians have become the backbone of county and commune industries. In the northernmost Heihe region of our country, the dispatch of more than 1,200 cadres has ensured that each people's commune, management area, and production team in the region has one or two county-level cadres as backbone members, greatly strengthening the leadership of agricultural production in remote areas.

    An important characteristic of urban support for agriculture in Heilongjiang Province is the planned and leadership-guided relocation of factories that are beneficial to agricultural development and factories with raw material production areas in the countryside, batch by batch. In the past few months, 34 factories in Harbin City have already moved to the countryside, and now another 49 factories in machinery, light industry, chemical industry, and other sectors are undergoing relocation to the countryside. The factories that have already moved to the countryside have powerfully promoted the process of agricultural technological transformation and driven the development of county and commune industries, enabling the machinery industries in various counties to develop from only being able to manufacture and repair general agricultural implements in the past to manufacturing products such as lathes, diesel engines, seeders, and harvesters. After the Songhua River Agricultural Machinery Factory moved to Wuchang, it trained technical personnel for the county and commune industries of this county, improved the technical level, and manufactured a large number of paddy field machines, so that all paddy field production in the county, except for harvesting, used mechanical agricultural implements and semi-mechanized agricultural implements. At the same time, because these factories are close to the raw material production areas, they not only enable the factories themselves to develop, but also facilitate the integration of industry and agriculture, making it easier for workers to farm during busy agricultural seasons and engage in their own profession during slack seasons. For example, the pharmaceutical factory that moved from Harbin to Hulan County at the end of last year has already established a raw material base in Mengjiagang, Hulan County, which has not only enabled workers to learn the two skills of being able to work and farm, but also fully utilized local wild plants to trial-produce more than ten new products to supply urban and rural people.

    Another characteristic of urban support for agriculture in Heilongjiang Province is the relocation of universities, colleges, and scientific research institutions suitable for establishment in rural areas to the countryside, bringing science, culture, and technology with them. These units are now actively preparing to go to the countryside. The Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is actively moving to pastoral areas with lush grasslands, where there are herds of horses and cattle and sheep available for research and experimentation. The Heilongjiang Agricultural Mechanization College is also moving to the countryside.

    The mobilization of strong human, material, scientific, cultural, and technological forces from cities in Heilongjiang Province to build the countryside has greatly inspired the farmers. They have seen large numbers of workers, cadres, and students go to the countryside, factories being established in places that originally had no industry, and universities, colleges, and scientific research institutions being established in places where culture and science were originally underdeveloped. They said that this is truly "taking agriculture as the foundation," greatly enhancing the farmers' confidence in building the countryside. (Song Huajiang)

    黑龙江各城市近二十万人到农村安家落户
    决心把公社化的农村建设得更美好
    一批批有利于农业发展的工厂和学校、研究机关迁往农村
    本报讯　黑龙江省各城市正掀起到农村去，参加农村建设的高潮。目前，全省已有近二十万名机关干部、工矿企业的工人、大专学校的师生和科学研究机关的人员，把无产阶级思想和科学、文化、技术带到农村去安家落户，和全省农民一道大办农业、大办粮食，加速公社化后的农村建设。
    第一个五年计划期间，黑龙江省在全国支援下，全党全民大搞工业，使这个工业基础相当薄弱，原来只有油、酒、米、面加工业和一些机器修理业的地方，迅速建设成为国家重要工业基地之一。现在它有着雄厚的物资基础和技术条件，支援农业，加速农村的建设。黑龙江省土地肥沃，物产丰富，交通便利，农业机械化已有良好基础，全省农村的粮食商品率已达50％左右，成为国家的重要农业地区。还有上亿亩肥沃的处女地，和几千万亩肥美的草原，农业发展前途很大。为了高速度发展农业，加速建设农村，最近几个月，黑龙江省各地党组织，普遍向城乡人民进行了以农业为基础，大办农业、大办粮食，加速建设农村的教育，进一步提高了广大人民的政治思想觉悟。目前，各个城市已经树起了热爱农村，热爱农业劳动，下乡参加农村建设的新风气。全省所有的机关、工矿企业和学校，广泛开展了讨论，人们纷纷写大字报，写申请书，表示要在党的领导下，和农民一道，用自己的双手，用自己的劳动，把公社化后的农村建设得更加美好。
    目前，黑龙江省各城市，一批批干部、技术工人、学生和城市居民，满腔热情地奔赴农业生产第一线。据统计：下到农村的劳动力已达近二十万人。其中各级干部就有一万六千多人，他们大多数都是熟悉基层工作，和有一定群众工作经验的干部，有的是县委书记和县长，有的是企业部门的领导干部。齐齐哈尔市下去的一万多劳动力中，各级干部就有一千六百多名，他们到农村后，有的担任了基层领导，有的当了社员。二千三百多名技术工人，都成为县、社工业的骨干。我国最北部的黑河地区，由于下派了一千二百多名干部，使这个地区的人民公社、管理区和生产队，都有一两名县级干部作骨干，大大充实了边远地区农业生产的领导力量。
    黑龙江省各城市支援农业的一个重要特点，是把有利发展农业的工厂和原料产地在农村的工厂，一批一批有计划有领导地搬到农村去。哈尔滨市前几个月已有三十四个工厂迁到农村，现在又有四十九个机械、轻工业、化学工业等工厂，正在进行迁厂下乡工作。已经迁到农村的工厂，有力地促进农业技术改造的进程和带动了县社工业的发展，使各县的机械工业，在过去只能制造和修理一般农具的基础上，发展到制造车床、柴油机、播种机、收割机等产品。松花江农业机械厂迁到五常后，为这个县的县社工业培训技术人材，提高了技术水平，制造了大批水田机械，使全县水田生产，除收割外全部使用机械农具和半机械化农具作业了。同时，由于这些工厂接近原料产地，不仅使工厂本身得到发展，更利于工农业结合，便于工人在农忙时务农，农闲务本业。像去年底由哈尔滨迁到呼兰县的制药厂，已经在呼兰县孟家岗建立了原料基地，不仅使工人学会了既会做工又会务农的两套本领，而且充分利用当地野生植物，试制了十多种新产品，供应城乡人民。
    黑龙江省城市支援农业的另一个特点，是把适合设在农村的大、专学校，科学研究机关，带着科学、文化、技术搬到农村去。现在这些单位正在积极进行下农村的准备工作。中国科学院哈尔滨兽医研究所，正在积极迁往有肥美草原的牧区，那里有成群马匹和牛羊，可供研究试验。黑龙江农业机械化学院也正在迁往农村。
    黑龙江省从城市动员强大的人力、物力，和科学文化、技术力量建设农村，对农民的鼓舞很大。他们看到大批工人、干部和学生下到农村，在那些原来没有工业的地方，办起了工厂，原来文化科学不发达的地方，有了大、专学校和科学研究机关，他们说，这才是“以农业为基础”呢，大大增强了农民的建设农村的信心。　（宋化江）
