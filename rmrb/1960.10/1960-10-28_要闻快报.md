　　Qijiang Coal and Iron Front Attacks Sulfur Barriers

　　Workers at the Qijiang County Coal Mine, Coking Plant, and Iron Plant in Sichuan Province are working together to carry out an "integrated" sulfur removal campaign. All aspects, including picking, washing, selecting, crushing, and transporting, are closely coordinated. The coal mine and coking plant are focusing on the first critical step. For example, the Haikong Coal Mine established a specialized ore selection team to strengthen the selection process. The iron plants are also focusing on raw material quality, striving to improve the quality of ore. The Xinjiezi Iron Plant established a system of "five selections" and "three prohibitions for furnace entry" to ensure high-quality materials are used. The production and quality of coal, coke, and pig iron throughout the county are gradually increasing. In early October, the average sulfur content of pig iron throughout the county decreased from 0.133% in September to 0.128%.

　　Based in One's Own Shift, Facing the Entire Team

　　In the coal production increase competition, the First Coal Mining Team of the Fourth Mine of the Yangquan Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province has created an advanced experience of "mutual surpassing and mutual supplementation," with each person based in their own shift and facing the entire team. The specific method is: when production conditions are good, organize shifts to surpass each other; when encountering difficulties, organize shifts to supplement each other, ensuring that "shift deficits (production) do not exceed a day, and team deficits (production) do not exceed ten days." In the "mutual surpassing, mutual supplementation" competition of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping, leading cadres constantly educate the workers of the entire team with collectivist thought, making the communist spirit of the workers increasingly high, everyone thinking and planning for the team, and production flourishing.

　　On-Site Design Accelerates Coal Mine Technical Transformation

　　The Chongqing Coal Mine Design and Research Institute in Sichuan has successively sent more than 200 engineering and technical personnel to mine sites to engage in on-site design and scientific research with mine workers and technicians, closely integrating design work with the actual production of mines, accelerating the technical transformation of mines, and promoting the increase in coal and coke production. For example, technical personnel at the Nantong Mining Area worked alongside workers to study ways to increase coal and coke production. In the past two months or so, in the design of 30 mine technical transformations, they summarized ten types of experience, such as indigenous conveyors, indigenous electric bottles, and indigenous coal crushers, targeting weak links such as excavation, mining, transportation, washing, and refining, and assisted workers in making more than 50 sets of simple tools, generally increasing coal and coke production by one to three times.

　　"Five Fixed" System in Mining Area Transportation Increases Efficiency by Half

　　In the fourth quarter high-yield transportation campaign, the Jiaotong Transportation Department in Xuzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, adopted the "five fixed" method of fixed points, fixed quantities, fixed routes, fixed vehicles, and fixed personnel to strengthen the organization of short-distance transportation in the mining area and improve transportation efficiency. The daily transportation volume has increased by 50% compared with the past, with the highest reaching about double, not only achieving immediate transport of production, transporting as much as is produced, but also transporting more than 27,000 tons of stored coal.

　　Huainan City Coking Plants Vigorously Recover Coal Tar

　　The coking plants in Huainan City, Anhui Province, have summarized and promoted the advanced experience of Wuwei Coking Plant and Huainan Coking Plant in extracting oil from tall chimneys of indigenous coke ovens and overall oil extraction, achieving large-scale increases in coal tar recovery. The city's coal tar production in the second quarter of this year increased by 116% compared with the first quarter, and the third quarter increased by another 26.5% compared with the second quarter. The coal tar produced in the first nine months of this year increased by 3.5 times compared with the total production of last year. Currently, the plants have refined 81 tons of gasoline, 230 tons of kerosene, 580 tons of light diesel, 178 tons of creosote, and 90 tons of anticorrosive oil from coal tar.

　　Early Stockpiling of Winter Ore for Small Blast Furnaces

　　After overfulfilling the annual production plan ahead of schedule on October 10, the Baiyin City Iron Plant in Gansu Province continued to strengthen leadership in the production and transportation of ore, and mobilized the masses to vigorously engage in technical revolution. Mining workers successfully developed a foot-operated drilling machine and advanced blasting methods, increasing work efficiency by one to two times; loading and unloading workers made a tipping loading platform that can load six tons of ore at a time, increasing loading efficiency by more than two times; in addition, they also made a batch of wooden rail cars, tipper trucks, etc., to improve transportation efficiency. Currently, the plant has stockpiled enough ore for three months of production for small blast furnaces to get through the winter.

    要闻快报
    綦江煤铁战线关关攻硫
    四川省綦江县煤矿、焦厂、铁厂职工，同心协力，一齐动手，开展了“一条龙”全线攻硫竞赛。拣、洗、选、碎、运等各个环节都紧密结合。煤矿、焦厂首先把紧第一关。如海孔煤矿成立了一个专业选?队，加强选?工作。各铁厂也把紧原料关，千方百计提高矿石的质量。新街子铁厂建立了“五选”“三不入炉”的制度，做到精料入炉。全县煤、焦、生铁的产量和质量逐步上升。10月上旬全县生铁平均含硫量，由9月份的0.133％下降到0.128％。
    立足本班　面向全队
    山西阳泉矿务局四矿一坑采煤一队在增产煤炭的竞赛中，人人立足本班，面向全队，创造了“互超互补”竞赛的先进经验。具体作法是：在生产条件好的情况下，组织班班互超，遇到困难时，就组织班班互补，保证了“班亏（产）不过日，队亏（产）不过旬”。在“互超、互补”的比、学、赶、帮竞赛中，领导干部时时刻刻以集体主义思想教育全队的工人，使工人的共产主义风格越来越高，人人为队着想，个个为队打算，生产蒸蒸日上。
    现场设计加速煤矿技术改造
    四川重庆煤矿设计研究院先后派出工程技术人员二百多人到矿山现场，与矿山工人、技术人员一起大搞现场设计和科学研究，使设计工作与矿山生产实际紧密结合，加速了矿山技术改造，促进了煤焦增产。例如，到南桐矿区的技术人员跟班劳动，与工人一道研究增产煤焦的办法。两个多月来，他们在三十个矿井技术改造的设计中，针对掘、采、运、洗、炼等薄弱环节，总结了土运输机，土电瓶、土碎煤机等十种经验，并协助工人制成五十多套简易工具，煤焦产量一般都提高一至三倍多。
    矿区运输实行“五定”效率提高一半
    江苏徐州专区交通运输部门在第四季度运输高产运动中，采取定点、定量、定线、定车、定人的“五定”方法，加强矿区短途运输的组织工作，提高运输效率。每天的运输量比过去提高50％，最高达到一倍左右，不仅作到了随产随运，产多少运多少，还运出了二万七千多吨存煤。
    淮南市各炼焦厂大搞焦油回收
    安徽淮南市各炼焦厂总结推广了无为焦厂、淮南焦厂土焦炉高烟囱抽油和总体提油的先进经验，焦油回收获得大面积丰产。全市今年第二季度煤焦油产量比第一季度增长116％，第三季度又比第二季度增长26.5％，今年九个月所产焦油比去年全年总产量增长三点五倍。现在，各厂已从煤焦油中提炼出汽油八十一吨，煤油二百三十吨，轻柴油五百八十吨，焦油酸一百七十八吨，防腐油九十吨。
