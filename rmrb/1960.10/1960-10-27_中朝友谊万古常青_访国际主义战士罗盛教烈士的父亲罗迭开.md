    On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, I interviewed Luo Diekai, the father of the great internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao. A few days ago, he received a letter from his Korean son, Cui ?. The letter said: Our blood ties make me feel as if I am sitting next to my Chinese father and mother all the time; this kind of friendship is like brilliant sunshine shining on the earth, making me feel warm all the time. In the letter, Cui ? reported his work situation to his Chinese father, expressing that he would often learn from the revolutionary spirit of his brother Shengjiao and contribute everything he has to the revolutionary cause. Luo Diekai is a hale and hearty old man of sixty. When I went to visit him, he was preparing to reply to Cui ?. The old man enthusiastically described the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, forged with blood.

    On January 2, 1952, Luo Diekai's son, Luo Shengjiao, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers, gloriously gave his precious life to rescue a Korean boy, Cui ? (now a soldier in the Korean People's Army), who had accidentally fallen into an ice cave. Luo Shengjiao's noble internationalist spirit has been infinitely admired by the Chinese and Korean peoples. The people of Shitainli Village in Chengchuan County, South Pyongan Province, Korea, where he sacrificed, buried the martyr according to the most solemn etiquette of the Korean people, and renamed Shitainli Village "Luo Shengjiao Village," Nili River "Luo Shengjiao River," and the place where the martyr was buried "Luo Shengjiao Mountain." In order to commemorate the martyr, the Korean people also built the "Luo Shengjiao Monument," and Premier Kim Il-sung personally inscribed on the monument: "The internationalist spirit of Martyr Luo Shengjiao will forever coexist with the Korean people." The Korean people circulate the lyrics: "Green river, high mountain, Chinese heroes live forever, we love Luo Shengjiao, we can't stop singing praises!"

    "The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people cannot be described in words, it is endless," Luo Diekai said at the beginning. From Luo Shengjiao's sacrifice in 1952 to the present, he has received a large number of letters from all over Korea every year. Many letters warmly call him "Chinese Father" and the martyr's mother "Chinese Mother." The letters are written by workers, farmers, soldiers of the People's Army, teachers and students of schools, and family members of martyrs. Some report to the old man on the achievements of socialist construction in Korea; some report on their achievements in work and study; some ask the old man to introduce the life of Martyr Luo Shengjiao; and some express their determination to resolutely learn from the internationalist spirit of Martyr Luo Shengjiao and do a good job in work and study. Every letter, every word, expresses the deep feelings of the Korean people. In the past eight years, he has received more than 3,000 such letters, and more than 40 this year. In addition to enthusiastic letters, the Korean people also gave the old man their most cherished things as gifts. These gifts include exquisite Korean national costumes, tableware, jewelry, shoes and socks, etc. He told me that Park Jae-geun, a famous Korean internationalist fighter, once shielded Volunteer soldiers from enemy bullets with his body. After Park Jae-geun's sacrifice, his wife, Li Yushan, also gave her wedding clothes and jewelry to the old man's second daughter, Wanxiang. What the old man could not forget the most was that in 1953, when he participated in the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to express condolences, he was warmly welcomed by the Korean people. He recalled: When he arrived at "Luo Shengjiao Village" in Chengchuan County, the men and women, old and young, in the village lined up, beat gongs and drums, and warmly welcomed him. People lifted him up. Here, he met his Korean son Cui ? for the first time. The father and son embraced warmly. The old man, Cui ?, and Cui ?'s father slept on the same kang and talked until late at night. At that time, he said excitedly: "Shengjiao, you will always live in the hearts of the Korean people. Here, you have relatives everywhere - your uncles, brothers, sisters, and comrades." What was even more unforgettable for him was meeting Premier Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people. Premier Kim Il-sung filled a glass of wine at the banquet, brought it to him, and said kindly: "Thank you for giving birth to a good son. He sacrificed for the Korean people. Thank you for being such a good father." The old man said: "I will never forget these scenes."

    Talking about Cui ?, the old man said: "He is a good boy." Cui ? often writes to him to say hello and report on his work and study. In 1954, Cui ? came to his home with the Korean People's Delegation to China, and affectionately called the old people "Dad! Mom!" They hugged each other tightly and shed tears. He always replies to Cui ? quickly every time he receives a letter. This year, he wrote three letters to Cui ?, telling him about the situation at home and the achievements of socialist construction in his hometown, and encouraging Cui ? to study hard, work hard, and defend socialist construction. In his recent letter to Cui ?, he said: "In the past few years, under the cultivation and education of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, you have grown rapidly. I hope you will always remember to dedicate your life to the great and noble cause of the Party and the people forever."

    He also cherishes every letter from his Korean friends very much. In 1958, after receiving a letter from Li Yushan, the wife of Martyr Park Jae-geun, he replied: "When I received your letter, I was particularly excited. You introduced me to a series of situations in the spirit of proletarian internationalism. When I see letters from the Korean people, I always read them again and again, especially your letter, I read it three times, it's like receiving a letter from a long-lost relative." He also treasures every gift sent by the Korean people like a treasure. When we went to visit him, he took out a Korean-style silk jacket. He said: "This was given to me personally by Premier Kim Il-sung when I went to Korea in 1953. Wearing this clothes, I feel warmer in my heart and remember the deep friendship of the Korean people even more!"

    When I said goodbye to him, he said: The profound friendship between us and the Korean people forged in the common struggle against US imperialist aggression will surely be evergreen like the pine trees of Changbai Mountain and flow endlessly like the waters of the Yalu River.

    中朝友谊万古常青
    ——访国际主义战士罗盛教烈士的父亲罗迭开
    新华社记者  刘见初
    在中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战十周年的前夕，我访问了伟大的国际主义战士罗盛教烈士的父亲罗迭开。前几天，他接到他朝鲜儿子崔?的来信。信上说：我们的骨血情谊，使我时刻感到好像坐在中国爸爸、妈妈身边；这种情谊好像灿烂的阳光照到大地，使我时刻感到温暖。在信里，崔?向他的中国爸爸汇报了自己工作情况，表示要经常学习盛教哥哥的革命精神，把自己的一切贡献给革命事业。罗迭开是位年已六十、身体健壮的老人。我去访问他的时候，他正在准备给崔?回信。老人热情洋溢地叙述了中朝人民这种用鲜血结成的牢不可破的友谊。
    1952年1月2日，罗迭开的儿子——中国人民志愿军战士罗盛教为了抢救失足掉进冰窟的朝鲜少年崔?（现在是朝鲜人民军战士），光荣地献出了自己宝贵的生命。罗盛教这种崇高的国际主义精神，受到中朝人民无限的崇敬。在他牺牲的地方——朝鲜平安南道成川郡石田里的人民，按照朝鲜人民最隆重的礼仪安葬烈士，并将石田里改名“罗盛教村”，泥栎河改名“罗盛教河”，安葬烈士的地方改名为“罗盛教山”。为了纪念烈士，朝鲜人民还修建了“罗盛教纪念碑”，金日成首相亲笔在纪念碑上题词：“罗盛教烈士的国际主义精神与朝鲜人民永远共存”。朝鲜人民中流传着“青青河，高高山，中国英雄万万年，我们心爱罗盛教，赞美的歌儿唱不完！”的歌词。
    “中朝两国人民的友谊是不能用言语来形容的，说不完，也讲不尽。”罗迭开一开头就这样说。从1952年罗盛教牺牲到现在，他每年都收到来自朝鲜各地的大批信件。许多信上热情地称他为“中国爸爸”，烈士的母亲为“中国妈妈”。写信的有工人、农民、人民军战士、学校师生和烈军属等。他们有的向老人报告朝鲜社会主义建设的成就；有的汇报自己在工作和学习中的成绩；有的要求老人介绍罗盛教烈士的生平事迹，有的表示自己坚决学习罗盛教烈士的国际主义精神，做好工作和学习的决心。每一封信，每一句话，都表达了朝鲜人民的深情厚意。八年来，他收到这样的信三千多封，今年收到的有四十多封。除了热情洋溢的信件外，朝鲜人民还把自己最珍爱的东西当作礼品送给老人。这些礼品有精致的朝鲜民族服装、餐具、首饰、鞋袜等。他告诉我，朝鲜著名的国际主义战士朴在根曾经以自己的身体挡住敌人的炮弹，掩护了志愿军伤员，他的妻子李玉善在朴在根牺牲以后，也把自己结婚时穿的衣服、戴的首饰等，送给了老人的第二个女儿婉香。最使老人不能忘怀的是1953年他参加中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团到了朝鲜，受到朝鲜人民的热烈欢迎。他回忆道：当他到达成川郡“罗盛教村”的时候，村里的男女老少成行列队，敲锣打鼓，热烈地欢迎他，人们把他抬起来。在这里，他第一次会见了他的朝鲜儿子崔?，父子俩热情地拥抱，老人、崔?和崔?的父亲三个人睡在一个炕上，长谈到深夜。那时，他激动地说：“盛教，你永远活在朝鲜人民的心里，这里到处都有你的亲人——你的伯伯、叔叔、兄弟、姐妹和战友。”更使他难忘的，是会见了朝鲜人民的领袖金日成首相。金日成首相在宴会上斟满一杯酒，拿到他跟前，亲切地对他说：“谢谢你生了一个好儿子，他为朝鲜人民牺牲了，谢谢你这样的好爸爸。”老人说：“这些情景，我永远也忘不了。”
    谈到崔?，老人说：“那是个好孩子。”崔?经常给他写信问好，汇报自己的工作和学习。1954年，崔?随朝鲜人民访华代表团，来到他的家里，亲切地叫老人们“爸爸！妈妈！”的时候，他们紧紧地抱在一起，流下了眼泪。崔?每次来信，他都很快复信。今年，他就给崔?写了三封信，告诉家里的情况和家乡社会主义建设的成就，勉励崔?努力学习、好好工作，保卫社会主义建设。最近他给崔?的信上说：“几年来，你在朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民的领袖金日成首相的培养教育下，飞快成长，希望你永远记住，将你的一生永远献给党和人民的伟大崇高事业。”
    他对朝鲜朋友的每一封来信，也都非常珍惜。1958年，他接到朴在根烈士的妻子李玉善的来信以后，他复信说：“当接到您的来信，我的心情特别激动。您以无产阶级国际主义的精神向我介绍了一系列的情况。我看到了朝鲜人民的来信，总是看一遍又一遍，特别是您的信，我连看了三遍，真像见到久别亲人的来信一样。”他对朝鲜人民送来的每一件礼品，也都像珍宝一样地保存着。我们去访问时，他拿出一件朝鲜式样的绸料上衣。他说：“这是1953年我去朝鲜时金日成首相亲手送给我的，穿了这件衣，心里更加暖和，更加记得朝鲜人民的深厚友谊！”
    当我和他告别时，他说：我们和朝鲜人民在反对美帝国主义侵略的共同斗争中结下的深厚友谊，一定会像长白山的苍松一样，永远常青，像鸭绿江的水一样，永流不断。
