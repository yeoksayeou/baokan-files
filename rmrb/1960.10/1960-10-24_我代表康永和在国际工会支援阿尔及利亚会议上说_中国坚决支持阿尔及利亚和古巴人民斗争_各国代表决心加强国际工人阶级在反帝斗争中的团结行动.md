Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 22nd: Kang Yonghe, head of the Chinese trade union delegation, said at the closing meeting of the International Trade Union Committee in Support of Algerian Workers and People that the example of the heroic struggle of the Algerian people has promoted the development of the national and democratic movements of the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The Chinese workers and people resolutely support the just struggle of the Algerian workers and people and believe that the Algerian workers and people will surely defeat imperialist aggression and win the final and complete victory.

Kang Yonghe said that the victory of the Cuban people's revolution marked a new stage in the national and democratic revolutionary movements in Latin American countries. The victory of the Cuban revolution proved to the people of Latin America that US imperialism and its running dogs are just paper tigers and are not to be feared. He emphasized that the heroic struggle of the Cuban people is a strong support and encouragement to the struggle for liberation waged by the oppressed people of Latin America and the world, and a great contribution to defending world peace.

Kang Yonghe said that although the vast ocean separates China and Cuba, the cause of opposing US imperialism and striving for world peace closely unites the people of the two countries, because the people of the two countries face a common enemy, US imperialism. He said that in the struggle against US imperialism, the Chinese people and the Cuban people not only stand shoulder to shoulder on the same front, but also support and encourage each other.

Kang Yonghe, after talking about how the Chinese people's leader Mao Zedong and other leaders of the Party and the country are constantly watching with great enthusiasm and fully supporting the Cuban people's struggle to defend the revolution and oppose US imperialist intervention, said that the Chinese workers and people fully agree with the statement of our government on giving the Cuban people all possible support and assistance in the struggle against US imperialism. He emphasized that the Chinese people will never forget the support given by the Cuban people, and will never forget to support the Cuban people's struggle with their own efforts.

Kang Yonghe emphasized that US imperialism is very afraid of the friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Cuban people, and has been trying to undermine this solidarity. He said that we must counter the enemy's conspiracy by further strengthening the solidarity between the people of the two countries.

Kang Yonghe talked about the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the past eleven years under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. He said that currently the Chinese workers and people are victoriously carrying out socialist construction under the shining light of the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes.

When he mentioned the name of Mao Zedong and the Chinese people's support for Cuba, the entire hall stood up and applauded enthusiastically.

Kang Yonghe finally shouted slogans such as "Continuously consolidate and develop the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban people" and "Long live the militant friendship between the fraternal people of China and Cuba!" At this time, everyone in the entire hall stood up and shouted "Yes to Cuba, no to the Yankees!"

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 22nd: At the closing meeting of the Third International Trade Union Committee in Support of Algerian Workers and People held on the evening of the 21st, trade union representatives from various countries unanimously expressed their intention to strengthen the united action of the international working class in the anti-imperialist struggle in their speeches.

Abdelkader Machou, First Secretary of the General Union of Algerian Workers, said at the meeting that the Algerian people will never surrender and are determined to fight until they achieve national liberation. He said that the Algerian working class and people have taken up arms and stand with the Cuban workers and people.

Luigi Grassi, Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, called on trade unions and workers in various countries around the world to launch a broad mass movement to support the just struggle of the Algerian people in his speech.

Yeskandarov of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions said that Soviet workers have always supported and will always support the cause of the Algerian people. The Algerian patriots are fighting to eliminate the shameful colonial system that has been condemned by history. He said that the colonial system only makes people suffer and threatens world peace. He finally expressed the Soviet people's support for the Cuban people's struggle.

José Maria Aguilera, Propaganda Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Federation, strongly condemned the United Nations' intervention in the Congo. He then said that the Algerian people, who love the mountains and rivers of their motherland, have no reason to trust the United Nations and demand that the United Nations send a mission to their territory like the one sent to the Congo, thereby deceiving them of their freedom, for which they pay a high price every day.

Juan Campis, Vice Chairman of the United Workers' Confederation of Chile, and Zhu Zhongzhu, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Korean Professional Unions, unanimously expressed their support for the struggle of the Algerian and Cuban people against French colonialists and US imperialism in their speeches at the meeting.

Also speaking at the closing meeting were Kang Yonghe, head of the Chinese trade union delegation, Diallo Seidou, Secretary-General of the General Union of Black African Workers, Asaad Rajih, Secretary-General of the Arab Trade Union International Federation, and Lefrelo Elio Silvano, representative of the Italian trade unions. Núñez Jiménez, Director of the National Land Reform Committee, who represented the Cuban government at the meeting, also made a brief speech at the meeting.

    我代表康永和在国际工会支援阿尔及利亚会议上说
    中国坚决支持阿尔及利亚和古巴人民斗争
    各国代表决心加强国际工人阶级在反帝斗争中的团结行动
    新华社哈瓦那22日电　中国工会代表团团长康永和在国际工会支援阿尔及利亚工人及人民委员会的闭幕会议上说，阿尔及利亚人民英勇斗争的榜样，推动了非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族和民主运动的发展。中国的工人和人民坚决支持阿尔及利亚工人和人民的正义的斗争，并且相信阿尔及利亚工人和人民必将战胜帝国主义的侵略，赢得最后的和完全的胜利。
    康永和说，古巴人民革命的胜利标志着拉丁美洲各国的民族和民主革命运动已经进入了一个新的阶段。古巴革命的胜利向拉丁美洲各人民以事实证明，美帝国主义和它的走狗们只不过是纸老虎，并不可怕。他强调指出，古巴人民的英勇斗争对拉丁美洲和全世界被压迫人民所进行的争取解放的斗争是一个强有力的支持和鼓舞，对捍卫世界和平是一个巨大的贡献。
    康永和说，尽管辽阔的海洋把中国和古巴分隔着，反对美帝国主义和争取世界和平的斗争事业使两国人民亲密地团结在一起，因为两国的人民面临着共同的敌人美帝国主义。他说，在反对美帝国主义的斗争中，中国人民同古巴人民不但肩并肩的站在同一条战线上，而且相互支持和互相鼓舞。
    康永和在谈到中国人民的领袖毛泽东以及党和国家的其他领导人不断地以巨大的热情注视和全力支持为捍卫革命和反对美帝国主义干涉的古巴人民的斗争以后说，中国的工人和人民完全赞同我国政府关于给予古巴人民在反对美帝国主义的斗争中以一切尽可能的支持和援助的声明。他强调说，中国人民将永远不会忘记古巴人民所给予的支持，同样，将永远不会忘记以自己的努力支持古巴人民的斗争。
    康永和强调指出，美帝国主义对中国人民同古巴人民之间的友谊和团结感到十分恐惧，并且一直在设法破坏这种团结。他说，我们要通过进一步加强两国人民之间的团结来回击敌人的阴谋。
    康永和谈到中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下在过去十一年的社会主义革命和社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就。他说，目前中国的工人和人民正在总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗的照耀下，胜利地进行着社会主义建设。
    当他提到毛泽东的名字和中国人民对古巴的支持时，整个大厅的人都站了起来，并且热烈地鼓掌。
    康永和最后高呼“不断巩固和发展中古两国人民的友谊”、“中国和古巴兄弟人民之间的战斗友谊万岁”等口号。这时整个大厅的人都站了起来，大家高呼“要古巴，不要美国佬！”
    据新华社哈瓦那22日电　在国际工会支援阿尔及利亚工人及人民委员会第三次会议21日晚举行的闭幕会上，各国工会代表在发言中一致表示要加强国际工人阶级在反帝斗争中采取团结一致的行动。
    阿尔及利亚工人总联合会第一书记阿卜杜勒·卡德尔·马舒在会上说，阿尔及利亚人民永远也不会投降，他们决心一直战斗到获得民族的解放。他说，阿尔及利亚的工人阶级和人民拿起武器与古巴工人和人民站在一起。
    世界工会联合会书记路易吉·葛拉西在发言中要求世界各国工会和工人展开支持阿尔及利亚人民正义斗争的广泛的群众运动。
    全苏中央工会理事会理事叶斯坎达霍夫说，苏联工人过去和将来将永远支持阿尔及利亚人民的事业，阿尔及利亚的爱国者是为消灭受到历史宣判的可耻的殖民制度而进行斗争。他说，殖民制度只是使人民备受折磨和威胁全世界和平。他最后表示苏联人民支持古巴人民的斗争。
    古巴工人联合会宣传书记何塞·玛丽亚·阿吉莱拉强烈谴责联合国对刚果的干涉。他接着说，热爱自己祖国的山河的阿尔及利亚人民没有任何理由相信联合国，要求联合国向他们领土派去像派到刚果去的那样的使团，从而骗去他们的自由，而他们为了自由，每天付出很高的代价。
    智利工人统一工会副主席胡安·坎皮斯和朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会副委员长朱钟洙在会上的发言中一致表示支持阿尔及利亚人民和古巴人民反对法国殖民主义者和美帝国主义的斗争。
    在闭幕会上发言的还有中国工会代表团团长康永和、黑非洲工人总联合会总书记迪亚洛·赛杜，阿拉伯工会国际联合会总书记阿萨德·拉吉和意大利工会代表莱夫雷罗·埃利奥·西尔瓦诺。代表古巴政府参加会议的土地改革全国委员会主任努?斯·希门尼斯也在会上做了简要的发言。
