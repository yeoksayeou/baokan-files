Xinhua News Agency, 16th - The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent a telegram to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), firmly supporting the massive nationwide strike by four million Japanese workers to protest the assassination of outstanding Japanese patriotic politician Inejiro Asanuma by the US-Japanese reactionaries and to demand the abolition of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty." The telegram stated that the assassination of Mr. Inejiro Asanuma by fascist thugs was by no means accidental. This incident fully exposes the heinous face of the US-Japanese reactionaries who attempt to use terrorist means to suppress the patriotic and democratic forces of Japan that defend peace and democracy, and is a new challenge by the US-Japanese reactionaries to the Japanese workers and people.

The telegram said that we firmly believe that fascist atrocities cannot intimidate the heroic Japanese workers and people; they can only arouse greater anger among the Japanese workers and people, further strengthen unity, and more resolutely launch a struggle against the US-Japanese reactionaries. The nationwide strike by four million Japanese workers powerfully illustrates this point. We wish your struggle a glorious victory.

    全总支持日本工人全国大罢工
    新华社16日讯　中华全国总工会今天致电日本工会总评议会，坚决支持日本四百万工人为抗议美日反动派杀害日本卓越的爱国政治家浅沼稻次郎、要求废除新日美“安全条约”而举行的声势浩大的全国大罢工。电报说，浅沼稻次郎先生被法西斯暴徒所杀害，决非是偶然的。这一事件充分地暴露出美日反动派企图用恐怖手段来镇压保卫和平与民主的日本爱国民主力量的凶恶面目，是美日反动派向日本工人和人民进行的新的挑战。
    电报说，我们坚信，法西斯暴行是恫吓不了英雄的日本工人和人民的；只能激起日本工人和人民更大的愤怒，更加加强团结、更坚决地向美日反动派展开斗争。日本四百万工人所举行的全国大罢工有力地说明了这一点。祝你们的斗争获得辉煌的胜利。
