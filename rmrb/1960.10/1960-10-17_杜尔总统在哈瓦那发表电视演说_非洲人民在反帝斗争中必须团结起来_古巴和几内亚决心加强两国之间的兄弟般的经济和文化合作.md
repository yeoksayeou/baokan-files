Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 15th. Guinean President Touré, who is visiting Cuba at the invitation of the Cuban government, delivered a televised speech in Havana today, stating, "The people of African countries are determined to unite and support the Algerian people in their struggle for independence." He condemned "the current imperialist attempts to divide the delegations of various countries in the United Nations on the Algerian issue. However, these conspiracies will be defeated because there is a great awareness among the African people of the need to provide assistance to the Algerian people."

Referring to the Congo issue, Touré said that African countries sent their troops to the Congo at the request of the United Nations, "but what happened later completely discouraged African countries. The United Nations disarmed the Congolese government army and attempted not to recognize the legitimate government headed by Lumumba. Imperialists provided gangsters with the means to create chaos, and then they profited from this chaos, while blaming the African people for causing the chaos." He added, "We hope that world opinion will mobilize to save the threatened independence of the Congo. Today in the Congo, a struggle against African colonialism is unfolding. Victory will surely belong to the people, no matter how long the struggle lasts."

Speaking of the struggle of the African people, he said, "The purpose of our struggle is to liberate the African people. In colonial countries, the economy is controlled by imperialism, which is against the interests of colonial countries. At present, the struggle of the African people is a struggle for political independence, because without political independence, economic and social liberation cannot be achieved." He added, "Guinea's role is a contribution to the African people's anti-imperialist struggle."

Touré emphasized, "Imperialist forces still exist in Africa. Therefore, Africans must unite. This is the basis of our policy of striving for the unity of the people of African countries." He said, "Colonial rule has divided Africa. To achieve liberation, the people of African countries must unite." He also said, "In Africa, the working class is the most aware class of imperialist exploitation and enslavement."

Speaking of his visit to Cuba, he said, "The entire Cuban people are following the leaders of the revolution. Here, this support is spontaneous and unanimous. They believe in the revolutionary government and have great confidence in the future. There is a will to continue to move forward." Touré said that in talks with the Cuban government, a joint decision had been reached to strengthen economic and cultural cooperation between Guinea and Cuba. The establishment of diplomatic relations can be expected. He said that a cultural agreement was signed today, and an economic agreement will also be signed after the arrival of the Guinean economic delegation in Havana. He said, "We see great prospects for future fraternal cooperation between Cuba and Guinea."

    杜尔总统在哈瓦那发表电视演说
    非洲人民在反帝斗争中必须团结起来
    古巴和几内亚决心加强两国之间的兄弟般的经济和文化合作
    新华社哈瓦那15日电　应古巴政府邀请到古巴访问的几内亚总统杜尔今天在哈瓦那发表电视讲话说，“非洲各国人民决心团结起来支援为独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民。”他谴责“目前存在着帝国主义企图在阿尔及利亚问题上分裂联合国中各国代表团的阴谋，但是，这些阴谋将遭到失败，因为非洲人民之间存在着要求给予阿尔及利亚人民援助的巨大的觉悟。”
    杜尔在谈到刚果问题时说，非洲国家在联合国的要求下向刚果派遣了他们的军队，“但是后来所发生的事情完全使非洲各国灰心了。联合国解除了刚果政府军的武装，并且企图不承认以卢蒙巴为首的合法政府。帝国主义者向匪徒们提供了制造混乱的办法，随后他们从这种混乱中取利，而把造成混乱的罪名推在非洲各国人民的身上。”他又说，“我们希望世界舆论动员起来，拯救受到威胁的刚果的独立。今天在刚果，正在展开反对非洲殖民主义的斗争。胜利必将属于人民，至于斗争要延续多久，那并没有关系。”
    他在谈到非洲人民的斗争时说，“我们斗争的目的是解放非洲人民。在殖民地国家，经济是由反对殖民地国家利益的帝国主义控制的。目前，非洲人民的斗争是争取政治独立的斗争，因为没有政治独立就不能取得经济和社会的解放。”他又说，“几内亚所起的作用是对非洲人民反帝斗争的贡献。”
    杜尔强调指出，“帝国主义力量还在非洲存在着。因此，非洲人必须团结起来。这就是我们争取非洲各国人民团结的政策的基础。”他说，“殖民统治分裂了非洲。为了获得解放，非洲各国人民必须团结起来。”他还说，“在非洲，工人阶级是对帝国主义剥削和奴役最有觉悟的阶级。”
    他在谈到访问古巴时说，“古巴全国人民跟随着革命的领导人。在这里，这种拥护是自发和一致的。他们相信革命政府，并且有着对未来的巨大信心。有继续向前迈进的意志。”杜尔说，在同古巴政府的会谈中，已经达成了加强几内亚和古巴之间的经济和文化合作的共同决定。可以预料到外交关系的建立。他说，今天签订了文化协定，几内亚经济代表团抵达哈瓦那后还将签订经济协定。他说，“我们看到了古巴和几内亚之间未来的兄弟般合作的伟大前景”。
