    Attempting to Intimidate the South Korean People's Anti-American Struggle
    The United States Drives South Korean Puppet Troops to Hold Continuous Exercises
    In order to threaten the South Korean people, who are expanding their anti-American struggle, at the end of September, American imperialism drove the South Korean puppet navy and marines to conduct a so-called "large-scale amphibious landing exercise" off the coast of Pohang on the east coast. In addition, the South Korean puppets will also conduct some kind of "division-scale exercise" until October 15. Furthermore, over three days starting from September 22, the puppet marines also conducted a "night search and reconnaissance exercise" in the coastal area of Jeju Island.

    妄图恫吓南朝鲜人民的反美斗争
    美国驱使南朝鲜伪军连续举行演习
    为了对正在扩大反美斗争的南朝鲜人民进行威胁，9月末，美帝国主义驱使南朝鲜傀儡海军和海军陆战队在东海岸浦项近海进行所谓“大规模登陆作战演习”。此外，南朝鲜傀儡还要进行什么“师团规模的演习”，一直到10月15日为止。另外，从9月22日开始的三天内，傀儡海军陆战队还在济州岛的海岸地区进行了“夜间搜索侦察演习”。
