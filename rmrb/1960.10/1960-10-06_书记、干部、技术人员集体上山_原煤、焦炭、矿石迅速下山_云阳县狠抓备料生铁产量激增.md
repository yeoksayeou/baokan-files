Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Electric Dispatch: The workers on the iron and steel front in Yunyang County, Sichuan Province, are carrying out a mass movement of "three ups and three downs and three surpluses": Secretaries, cadres, and technicians go uphill, raw coal, coke, and ore go downhill; and coal, coke, ore, and transportation are surplus at the furnace-side, giving the small indigenous blast furnaces in the county a vigorous leap forward. Since the launch of this movement, iron factories throughout the county have had sufficient stockpiles of "grain and grass," and production has continuously increased. The number of small high furnaces put into production has increased from the original fifty-eight to eighty-three. From September 1st to 20th, the average daily output of pig iron increased by 23.8% compared to August and 40% compared to July.

Yunyang County is one of the key counties in Sichuan Province supplying pig iron to the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company for steelmaking. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the county faced a situation where the demand for raw materials and fuel increased rapidly due to the rapid improvement in the level of ironmaking production. In order to increase the production of more pig iron to support key steel plants, the party secretaries of industrial and transportation departments at all levels personally took command, leading 80% of the cadres and technicians to bring the advanced experience of the technical revolution to the mines, trying every means to increase the production of raw coal, coke, and ore, and transporting these three major raw materials and fuels to the furnace-side in a timely manner.

After the leading cadres went deep into the mines, they first focused on technical transformation work to change the face of mine production. In the construction of mine bases, they carried out a series of improvements in terms of mine layout, development, ventilation, lighting, and underground and surface transportation. Now, more than half of the county's three hundred coal and iron mines have completed the transformation of one or two main shafts with larger output and normal production, improving mining methods, adding ventilation and lighting equipment. Underground transportation has generally undergone three transformations: changing small roadways into large roadways, changing curved roadways into straight roadways, changing wooden tracks into iron-wood tracks or small iron rails, and changing small carts into large carts, two-wheeled carts into four-wheeled carts. Many main shafts with a daily output of more than twenty tons have also achieved animal-powered traction trains, automatic sliding, and automatic loading and unloading. While carrying out technical transformation, more than thirty district-level coal and iron mines throughout the county have also further tapped the internal labor potential of enterprises in the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, rationally adjusted labor organization, carefully calculated, and successively transferred more than 2,500 elite soldiers and strong generals to strengthen the front line of mining.

In the movement to increase the production and transfer of coal, coke, and ore, the entire county launched a large-scale collaborative competition to ensure mining by tunneling, ensure ore extraction by mining, ensure ore exiting the well by extraction, ensure transportation by exiting the well, ensure blast furnaces by transportation, and ensure coking by raw coal, and ensure smelting by coking. In the competition, leading cadres at all levels went deep into each mine, worked with workers to tackle key production issues, break through weak links, and effectively solve specific problems encountered in production. In the movement, the Yuji Iron Factory also drew more than 200 laborers from offices, workshops, ground workers, and odd-job workers to form a shock team, led by the party secretary, focusing on solving the problem of coal, coke, and ore going downhill. While participating in production, they adopted a method of combining creation and repair, adding 90 various transportation vehicles, building 500 meters of aerial cableways, and 1,700 meters of iron-wood tracks, making transportation adapt to the needs of production. The raw coal, coke, and ore collected and transported to the blast furnace gradually increased every ten days, increasing pig iron production by more than two times compared to the original.

    书记、干部、技术人员集体上山　原煤、焦炭、矿石迅速下山
    云阳县狠抓备料生铁产量激增
    据新华社成都电　四川省云阳县钢铁战线职工正在开展一个书记、干部、技术人员三上山，原煤、焦炭、矿石三下山，炉边煤焦、矿石、运输三有余的群众运动，使炼铁小洋群出现了蓬蓬勃勃的跃进新局面。自从开展这一运动以来，全县各铁厂库存“粮草”充足，生产不断上升，投入生产的小高炉已由原来五十八个增加到八十三个；9月1至20日，生铁平均日产量比8月份增长23.8％，比7月份增长40％。
    云阳县是四川省供应重庆钢铁公司炼钢生铁的重点县之一。这个县在增产节约运动中，因为炼铁生产水平提高很快，需要的原料、燃料越来越多。为了增产更多的生铁支援重点钢厂，各级工业交通部门的党委书记亲自挂帅，率领80％的干部和技术人员，把技术革命中的先进经验带上矿山，千方百计增产原煤、焦炭、矿石，并把这三大原料燃料及时运到炉边。
    领导干部深入矿山后，首先是狠抓技术改造工作，改变矿山生产面貌。他们在矿山基地建设中，从矿井布局、开拓、通风、照明、井下和地面运输等方面进行了一系列的改进。现在全县三百多个煤、铁矿山，一半以上都已改造完了一个到两个产量较大、生产正常的主井，改进采掘方法。增添了通风、照明设备；井下运输普遍进行了三改：改小巷为大巷、改弯巷为直巷，改木轨道为铁木轨道或小铁轨，改小车为大车、两轮车为四轮车，许多日产二十吨以上的主井还实现了畜力牵引列车化、自动滑行和自动装卸。在进行技术改造的同时，全县三十多个区属以上煤铁厂矿也根据增产节约的精神，进一步挖掘企业内部劳动潜力，合理调整劳动组织，精打细算，陆续抽调出二千五百多名精兵良将加强了采掘第一线。
    在增产和调运煤、焦、矿石的运动中，全县掀起了一个以掘进保回采，回采保出井，出井保运输，运输保高炉，以及原煤保炼焦，炼焦保冶炼的连环协作大竞赛。各级领导干部在竞赛中，深入到每个矿井，同工人一道围攻生产关键，突破薄弱环节，切实解决生产中出现的具体问题。鱼季铁厂在运动中，还从股室、车间、地面工人和勤杂工中抽出二百多个劳力，组成一支突击队，由党委书记率领，重点解决煤焦和矿石下山问题。他们一面参加生产，一面采取创制和修旧相结合的办法，添置了各种运输车九十辆，新建架空索道五百米、铁木轨道一千七百多米，使运输适应了生产的需要，集运到高炉边的原煤、焦炭、矿石逐旬增加，使生铁产量比原来增长了二倍多。
