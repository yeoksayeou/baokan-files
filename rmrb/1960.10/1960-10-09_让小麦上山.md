    Letting Wheat Go Uphill
    Bai'an Production Brigade of Pengxin Commune in Luoshan County, Henan Province, is located in the Dabie Mountains. The cultivation habit here is to grow one season of rice, and there are very few wheat fields. Recently, in active response to the Party's call for vigorous development of agriculture and grain production, commune members decided to change the unreasonable planting habits, let wheat go uphill, and expand the wheat field planting area.
    The entire brigade plans to plant 420 mu of wheat, more than double that of previous years. In order not to compete with other crops for land, the entire brigade organized 170 laborers, led by Chen Chongfa, the secretary of the Party branch, to settle down on Bai'an Mountain and open up wasteland for wheat planting. The cadres participating in the land reclamation set an example and took the lead in labor, which greatly stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the commune members. The commune members of Zhongwan Team put forward the slogan: "If we want to compete, let's compete; if we want to work, let's work; each person digs 0.5 points per day, one day is better than two and a half days," and competed with He Bang Team, and as a result, they completed the task of reclaiming 105 mu of wasteland twelve days ahead of schedule. In order to improve the soil, the commune members planted vegetables on the newly reclaimed wasteland, and then interplanted wheat. This not only allows for harvesting an extra crop of vegetables, but also promotes soil ripening, ensuring that the wheat seedlings emerge completely and grow strong.

    让小麦上山
    河南罗山县彭新公社百庵生产大队位于大别山区，这里的耕作习惯是种一季水稻，麦田很少。最近，社员积极响应党的大办农业、大办粮食的号召，决定改变不合理的种植习惯，让小麦上山，扩大麦田播种面积。
    全队计划种麦四百二十亩，比往年扩大了一倍多。为了不与其他作物争地，全队组织了一百七十名劳力，在党支部书记陈重发的带领下，到百庵山上安家落户，开山种麦。参加开荒的干部以身作则，积极带头劳动，大大激发了社员的劳动热情。钟湾小队的社员提出：“要比咱就比，要干咱就干，每人每天挖五分，一天胜过两天半”的口号，与何榜小队竞赛，结果提前十二天完成了开荒一百零五亩的任务。为了改良土壤，社员们在新垦的荒地上种上了蔬菜，然后套种小麦。这样既可以多收一茬菜，又能促使土壤熟化，保证小麦苗全苗壮。
