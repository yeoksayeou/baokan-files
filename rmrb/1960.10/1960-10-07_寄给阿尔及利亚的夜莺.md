Nightingale Sent to Algeria
Cheng Guangrui

Reading at night, I was deeply moved by the sketch "Cell No. 7 is Silent" by Ahmed Akasha, an Algerian communist in prison, which eulogized the optimism, strength, and composure of Algerian patriots in Algiers prison before their execution. I couldn't sleep and wrote a poem as a gift.

My comrade, where are you tonight?
Are you gazing silently at the cold iron bars,
Or under a ray of moonlight in your cell,
Vigorously writing articles to denounce the colonialists?

Tonight, in my dream, I came to visit you in prison,
How I long to talk to you,
Taking advantage of the quiet night,
A thousand words, where to begin?
Let them all turn into angry verses.

Here we hear the clanging of shackles every day,
Here we also hear nightingales singing every night:
"Be brave, there is only good news,
Our Algeria, victory is in sight!"

Yes, Cell No. 7 is silent,
The loyal souls of the martyrs have risen to heaven;
The Algerian people will surely see,
Above the peaks, eagles soaring day and night.

Yes, Cell No. 7 is silent,
The blood of the martyrs irrigates the growing flowers and trees,
Can't you smell it?
At dawn, on the martyrs' graves,
The blooming winter jasmine spreads its fragrance.

Yes, Cell No. 7 is silent,
Perhaps more cells will be like it,
But the people will never be silent,
The voice of Algeria will always resound!

This voice surges with the waters of the Congo River,
And flies with the raging waves of the Caribbean Sea,
This voice also flies across mountains and rivers,
And sings joyfully with the youthful Yangtze and Yellow Rivers.

My comrade, where are you tonight?
You are not in prison, you are by my side,
Dear nightingale, let us sing together,
Welcoming victory, welcoming the dawn over the Mediterranean Sea!

    寄给阿尔及利亚的夜莺
    程光锐
    夜读阿尔及利亚共产党员阿迈德·阿卡歇狱中速写《七号牢房沉默了》，文中歌颂阿尔及利亚爱国者在阿尔及尔狱中的乐观、坚强、从容就义的精神，深受感动，不能成寐，成诗一首相赠。我的同志，今夜你在何方？是对着冰冷的铁窗默默凝想，还是在牢房里的一线月光下，振笔疾书控诉殖民者的文章？今夜，我在梦里来到狱中探
  望，我多想和你谈谈，趁着人静夜
  长，千言万语啊，从哪里说起？都让它们化作愤怒的诗行。这里每天都听到镣铐叮当，这里每夜也听到夜莺歌唱：“勇敢些吧，尽是好消息，祖国阿尔及利亚啊，胜利在
  望！”是的，七号牢房沉默了，烈士们的忠魂升到了天上；阿尔及利亚人民一定会看到，群峰之上，日夜有雄鹰飞翔。是的，七号牢房沉默了，烈士们的鲜血灌溉着花木滋
  长，你不是闻到了吗？黎明时分，烈士墓上，盛开的迎春散着芳
  香。是的，七号牢房沉默了，也许更多的牢房都会像它一
  样，可是，人民是永远不会沉默
  的，阿尔及利亚的声音永远铮铮震
  响！这声音和刚果河水一起翻腾，和加勒比海的狂涛一起飞扬，这声音也飞渡关山万重，和青春的长江黄河一起欢
  唱。我的同志，今夜你在何方？你不在狱中，你就在我的身旁，亲爱的夜莺啊，让我们一起高
  歌，迎接胜利，迎接地中海上的曙
  光！
