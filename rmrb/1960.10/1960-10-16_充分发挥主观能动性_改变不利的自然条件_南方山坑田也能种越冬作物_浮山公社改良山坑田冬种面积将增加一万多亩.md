Give Full Play to Subjective Initiative and Change Unfavorable Natural Conditions
Southern Mountain Pits Can Also Grow Overwintering Crops
Fushan Commune's Improved Mountain Pit Winter Planting Area Will Increase by More Than 10,000 Mu

According to the Southern Daily News, Fushan Commune in Raoping County, Guangdong Province, based on in-depth education of the masses on expanding the winter planting area, cadres and the masses went deep into the fields to survey the land, breaking the superstition that mountain pits could not grow winter crops. This enabled the commune to expand its planned winter planting area to 54,100 mu, an increase of 85% compared to the actual planted area last year, exceeding the county party committee's assigned winter planting task by 12%. While formulating the plan, they immediately began to improve the mountain pits so that these fields could be planted with overwintering crops in a timely manner. (Editor's note: Mountain pits are a type of cultivated land distributed in the valley areas of southern China. Its characteristics are poor sunshine, high soil moisture, and low ground temperature.)

Fushan Commune is located in a mountainous area. Of the commune's more than 58,000 mu of paddy fields, more than 18,000 mu are mountain pits.

Recently, when the commune party committee mobilized the various brigades to expand the winter planting area, many cadres and commune members, on the one hand, expressed their willingness to expand winter planting, and on the other hand, emphasized that the area suitable for winter planting in the commune has always been only about 40,000 mu, making it difficult to complete the plan to expand the winter planting area. The commune party committee analyzed these opinions and believed that on the one hand, it showed that some cadres and the masses still lacked sufficient understanding of the serious significance of expanding the winter planting area; on the other hand, it also showed that measures must be taken to improve the mountain pits in order to expand winter planting. Therefore, it was decided to carry out ideological work among the masses and solve practical difficulties.

Next, the commune party committee organized a large discussion on winter planting in all teams in the commune. On the one hand, the winter planting policy was publicized to the masses; on the other hand, the masses were inspired to summarize past experiences and calculate the benefits of expanding winter planting. The commune members of each team used their own experiences to illustrate the principle that the more winter planting, the better. The commune members of the Lilin Team unanimously agreed in the discussion that expanding winter planting production has five major benefits: First, increasing grain production; second, increasing income; third, providing more marketable grain for the state; fourth, the rotten leaves and green manure of winter crops can be used as fertilizer for the early rice crop next year; fifth, more winter crops can promote the development of animal husbandry. Through discussion, expanding the winter planting area has become a conscious requirement of every commune member.

But can mountain pits be used for winter planting? In order to solve this problem, Comrade Yang Yiying, the first secretary of the commune party committee who settled in the Lilin Brigade, went deep into the masses to discuss and study with them. Old farmer Chen Fenghuang said that the peas he planted in the mountain pit last winter grew very well. After listening to him, Yang Yiying led cadres, old farmers, and technicians to "Shuangkeng" (place name) to conduct on-the-spot investigations. After on-site analysis, everyone believed that the reasons why people previously emphasized that mountain pits could not be used for winter planting were: First, the soil is acidic, often accumulates water, has high humidity, and low ground temperature, which is not suitable for crop growth; second, mountain pits are all remote fields, the road is too far, cultivation and management are more difficult, and they are afraid that livestock will damage the crops, worrying that there will be no harvest after planting. Can the shortcomings of mountain pits be overcome? According to the experience of some old farmers, the soil quality of these mountain pits can be completely changed through subjective efforts. Therefore, everyone researched and summarized five measures to manage mountain pits: First, dig deep drainage ditches around the mountain pits to facilitate the removal of acidic water and accumulated water, prevent rainwater erosion, and reduce soil humidity; second, shovel grass turf on the spot, process it by smoking and burning, and apply it to the fields, which can increase fertilizer and increase soil temperature; third, for mountain pits that are clayey, take measures to add sand to improve the soil and improve the soil structure; fourth, rationally arrange crops according to different soil conditions; fifth, establish and improve the field management responsibility system to prevent damage to crops by humans and animals. Everyone believes that after taking these comprehensive management measures, mountain pits can not only effectively expand the winter planting area, but also be of great benefit to spring production next year. This is because the mountain pits in the past were not plowed and sun-dried in winter and accumulated water all year round. After winter planting, the soil is improved and the ground temperature is increased, and the early rice next year will definitely be planted better. After the improvement of the 950 mu of mountain pits in this brigade, 704 mu of land that had never been winter planted can be winter planted; coupled with intercropping and interplanting, the winter planting area of the entire team has increased from the original planned 750 mu to 2,157 mu.

After summarizing the experience of this brigade, the commune party committee promptly convened a meeting of cadres and old farmers above the production team level in the entire commune. Through on-site visits and introduction of experience, the major brigades immediately handed over the experience of the Lilin Brigade to the masses for discussion. After visiting, studying, and enthusiastically discussing, the broad masses of the people unanimously believed that this was a practical and feasible measure. On this basis, the entire commune used a combination of cadres, technicians, and the masses to conduct comprehensive planning on a piece-by-piece, team-by-team, and mound-by-mound basis, determining that more than 13,000 mu of the commune's more than 18,000 mu of mountain pits could be planted with winter crops; coupled with the comprehensive promotion of intercropping and interplanting, the winter planting area of the entire commune can reach 54,100 mu, accounting for 94% of the paddy field area.

After solving these problems, the enthusiasm of the masses became even higher. At present, 9,675 mu of mountain pits have been dug with drainage ditches, and at the same time, they have begun to accumulate winter planting fertilizers and soil improvement materials.

### 充分发挥主观能动性　改变不利的自然条件  南方山坑田也能种越冬作物  浮山公社改良山坑田冬种面积将增加一万多亩

    充分发挥主观能动性　改变不利的自然条件
    南方山坑田也能种越冬作物
    浮山公社改良山坑田冬种面积将增加一万多亩
    据南方日报消息　广东饶平县浮山公社在深入地向群众进行扩大冬种面积的教育的基础上，干部和群众一起深入田头，勘察土地，打破了历来所谓山坑田不能种植冬种作物的迷信，使全社计划冬种面积扩大到五万四千一百亩，比去年实种面积增加85％，超额12％完成县委分配的冬种任务。在制定计划的同时，立即着手改良山坑田，使这些田能够及时种上越冬作物。（编者注：山坑田是分布在南方山谷地区的一种耕地。它的特点是日照较差，土壤湿度大，地温低。）
    浮山公社地处山区，全社的五万八千余亩水田中，有山坑田一万八千多亩。
    最近，公社党委动员各个大队扩大冬种面积的时候，不少干部和社员一方面表示愿意扩大冬种，一方面又强调全社历年来适于冬种的面积只有四万亩左右，很难完成扩大冬种面积的计划。公社党委分析了这些人的意见，认为它一方面说明部分干部和群众对于扩大冬种面积的严重意义仍认识不足；一方面也说明，要扩大冬种就必须采取措施，改良山坑田。因此，决定既要向群众进行思想工作，又要解决实际困难。
    接着，公社党委在全社各队组织关于冬种问题的大讨论。一方面向群众宣传冬种政策；一方面启发群众总结以往经验，算扩大冬种的好处账。各队的社员都用切身体会说明了冬种多多益善的道理。荔林队的社员在讨论中一致认为扩大冬种生产有五大好处：一、增产粮食；二、增加收入；三、为国家提供更多的商品粮；四、冬种作物的烂叶和绿肥，可以用作明年早造的肥料；五、冬种作物多了，就可以促进畜牧业的发展。通过讨论，使扩大冬种面积成为每个社员的自觉要求了。
    但是山坑田能不能冬种呢？为了解决这一问题，在荔林大队落户的公社党委第一书记杨怡英同志，深入到群众中去，跟群众商量研究。老农陈凤凰说，他去年冬天在山坑田种植的豌豆生长很好。杨怡英听了他的话以后，便带领干部、老农、技术员到“双坑”（地名）去实地调查。经过现场分析，大家认为，以前人们强调山坑田不能冬种的原因有两个：一是土壤酸性大、经常积水、湿度大、地温低，不宜作物生长；二是山坑田都是边远田，路太远，耕作、管理比较困难，又怕牲畜损坏作物，担心种了以后没有收获。山坑田的缺点能不能克服呢？根据某些老农的经验，这些山坑田的土质，完全可以通过主观努力加以改变。于是大家研究和总结出治理山坑田的五条措施：第一、在山坑田的四周开深排水沟，以便于排除酸水和积水，防止雨水冲刷，降低土壤湿度；第二、就地铲草皮坭，加工熏烧后，施入田中，既可增加肥分，又能提高土壤温度；第三、对于属于粘土质的山坑田，采取加沙改土办法，改良土壤结构；第四、分别不同的土壤情况，合理安排作物；第五、建立和健全田间管理责任制，防止人畜损害作物。大家认为，采取这些综合措施治理以后，山坑田不仅可以有效地扩大冬种面积，而且对于明年春季生产也有很大好处。这是因为过去的山坑田都没有犁田冬晒，终年积水，经过冬种以后，改良了土壤，增加了地温，明年的早稻一定种得更好。这个大队的九百五十亩山坑田经过改良以后，有七百零四亩从来没有冬种的土地可以冬种；再加上间种、套种，全队冬种面积从原计划的七百五十亩增加到二千一百五十七亩。
    公社党委在总结了这个大队的经验以后，及时召开了全社生产小队以上的干部和老农会议，通过现场参观、介绍经验，各大队又立即把荔林大队的经验交给群众讨论。广大群众经过参观学习和热烈讨论，一致认为这是切实可行的措施。在此基础上，全公社运用干部、技术员和群众三结合的方法，逐片逐队逐丘地进行全面规划，确定全社一万八千多亩山坑田中有一万三千多亩可以种上冬种作物；再加上全面推广间种套种，全社冬种面积可以达到五万四千一百亩，占水田面积94％。
    解决了这些问题之后，群众情绪更加高涨。目前，已开好排水沟的山坑田有九千六百七十五亩，同时开始积集冬种肥料和改良土壤的材料。
