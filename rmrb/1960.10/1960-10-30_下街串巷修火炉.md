　　Repairing Stoves in the Streets and Alleys
　　One afternoon, after Master Wang Wen'an, a tinsmith from the Chongwen District Yi Xiang Black and White Metal Repair Shop, had repaired several stoves for residents in Shua Zi Shi, Zhushikou, it was already 6 p.m. Master Wang packed up his tools and had just started pushing his mobile cart when he heard someone calling from behind: "Master Wang, Master Wang!" Wang Wen'an thought something had fallen off his cart. When he turned around, he saw that it was Granny Zhai from No. 29, Jia Lane, who wanted her stove repaired. Wang Wen'an walked closer and saw that the stove plate was unusable. He put the stove on the cart and said to Granny Zhai: "This is quite a job. It's late today. I'll fix it tomorrow and bring it to you." The old lady said anxiously: "That won't do. The people who work need to eat when they come home at night!" Master Wang saw that Granny Zhai was in a difficult situation, so he immediately took the stove off the cart and said: "Alright! I'll go back a little later and make sure you get your meal." As he said this, he started working in front of Granny Zhai's house, hammering and banging away. Two hours later, the stove was repaired. Master Wang Wen'an carried the stove into Granny Zhai's courtyard and said: "When you start the fire, first use soft firewood, then use wood. I guarantee it won't break for half a year." Granny Zhai said very gratefully: "You are so good!"

    下街串巷修火炉
    一天下午，崇文区一巷黑白铁修理门市部王文安老师傅，在珠市口刷子市给居民修好了几个火炉后，已经是下午六点了，王师傅收拾好用具，刚推起流动车走了不远，就听到后边有人喊：王师傅，王师傅！王文安以为车上掉了什么东西，回头一看，是甲29号翟老太太要修炉子。王文安走近一看，火炉子盘已经不能用了。他把火炉搬到车上对翟老太太说：活挺费事，今天晚了，明天修好后给你送来吧。老太太着急地说：那可不行。上班的人晚上回来还要吃饭啊！王师傅看到翟老太太很为难，随手搬下炉子说：好吧！我晚回去一会，保证让你们吃上饭。说着就在翟老太太的家门口，钉钉当当干起来了。两个钟头以后，炉子修理好了。王文安老师傅把炉子给翟老太太搬进院里说：生火时先用软柴烧，后用木柴烧，保险你半年坏不了。翟老太太十分感激地说：你们真好啊！
