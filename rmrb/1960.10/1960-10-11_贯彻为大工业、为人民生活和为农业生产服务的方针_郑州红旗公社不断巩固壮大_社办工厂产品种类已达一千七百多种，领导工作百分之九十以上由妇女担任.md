    Implementing the Policy of Serving Large-Scale Industry, People's Livelihood, and Agricultural Production
    Zhengzhou Red Flag Commune Continues to Consolidate and Grow
    Commune-Run Factories Now Produce More Than 1,700 Kinds of Products; Women Hold More Than 90% of Leadership Positions
    (Our Dispatch) Zhengzhou's Red Flag People's Commune, one of the earliest established urban people's communes in the country, is increasingly demonstrating its unparalleled superiority and powerful vitality in its continuous development, growth, and consolidation. Now, this urban people's commune is several times larger than when it was established in 1958, boasting seven sub-communes, 150,000 workers and residents, and over a hundred factories engaged in industries such as machinery and electrical engineering, casting, small hardware, chemicals, and clothing, as well as various collective welfare institutions. Its commune-run factories powerfully assist the production of state-owned factories and supply the needs of the market, and have also made great contributions to local agricultural production. As of August, the commune-run factories produced over 1,700 kinds of products, an increase of more than 500 over last year, and 26 times more than the 66 kinds produced in the early days of the commune. Labor productivity has also increased several times compared to last year, and product costs have decreased by 30%.
    The Red Flag People's Commune has been continuously consolidated and developed by implementing the policy of having the commune's production serve large-scale industry, the people's livelihood, and agriculture. Starting at the beginning of this year, the Communist Party Committee of this commune, based on the policy of urban people's communes serving large factories, the people's livelihood, and agricultural production, conducted active rectification of the commune-run industry under the principles of developing, rectifying, consolidating, and improving simultaneously. In the process of rectification, consolidation, and development, the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily was resolutely implemented. They extensively utilized the offcuts, waste materials, and wastewater from large factories as raw materials. In terms of equipment, they used indigenous methods when foreign methods were not available, and small-scale solutions when large-scale solutions were not feasible, achieving "multiple uses for one factory, multiple uses for one item, making the best use of talent, and making the best use of resources." The Guancheng sub-commune used waste iron, waste silk, waste palm fiber, scrap cloth, gluten, and starch residue from large factories to produce more than 40 kinds of small hardware, welding rods, palm fiber beds, soy sauce, monosodium glutamate, vinegar, and small furniture. Under the guidance of serving agricultural production, the Erligang sub-commune established seven satellite factories, including paper bag, chemical, and wooden box factories, according to the urgent needs of local state-owned pharmaceutical factories. They used all available free time to process many waste materials that the pharmaceutical factories had not processed for several years, such as scrap wood, broken kraft paper, castor seeds, soapberry seeds, dried bean curd residue, and old paper cores, and produced more than 4.7 million main auxiliary materials such as paper bags, wooden boxes, and sulfuric acid tanks for the pesticide factory. With the help of the commune, the pesticide factory was able to solve the problem of obtaining these raw materials and materials, which in the past had to be purchased from Jilin, Shandong, Taiyuan, and other places, saving 140,000 yuan in transportation costs alone. The industrial products of the Erligang sub-commune's commune-run industry have also greatly developed in serving large factories. In order to meet the needs of urban people's lives, in August and September, the Red Flag People's Commune launched a mass movement to clear warehouses and obtain small commodities from all waste materials, resulting in an increase of 348 kinds of small commodities.
    The commune members of the Red Flag People's Commune have shown great enthusiasm in supporting agriculture. From January to July, the entire commune produced more than 4,000 tons of chemical fertilizer and more than 2,000 water pumps, electric motors, locomobiles, and other agricultural tools for agricultural production. The commune recently held a "National Support Agriculture Labor Day" activity, organizing 40,000 residents, as well as automobiles, horse-drawn carts, and wheelbarrows, to participate in labor and transportation in suburban production teams. On this day, they transported more than 3 million catties of fertilizer for agricultural production teams, weeded more than 6,000 mu, and repaired 50 large agricultural machines. Currently, the people of the entire commune are widely carrying out the "Do a Good Deed for Agriculture" movement.
    The extensive and in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in all walks of life in this commune has played a great role in the consolidation and development of commune-run industry. Due to the poor technical conditions, simple equipment, and large proportion of manual operations in commune-run industry, and the relatively urgent production tasks, this has further stimulated the strong desire of workers to change the status quo. In a very short period of time, they put forward more than 60,000 innovation proposals, more than 40,000 of which were implemented, greatly improving the level of mechanization of the commune's commune-run industry. For example, the workers of the foundry used waste materials and substitutes to make 44 pieces of machinery and equipment such as indigenous planers, grinding wheels, six-foot automatic lathes, electric drills, and slotting machines. The slotting machine, after it was made, increased work efficiency by 160 times.
    The Red Flag People's Commune has cultivated a contingent of capable women in the process of development and consolidation. Women account for more than 85% of the total labor force in the commune, and now more than 90% of the main leaders of the commune's more than 100 factories and various collective welfare institutions, such as factory directors, party branch secretaries, canteen directors, and nursery directors, are women. Before the people's commune, they were all ordinary housewives. Thanks to a series of measures taken by the commune's Party Committee to strengthen their training and their own efforts, they quickly mastered technology and improved their ability to handle affairs and their political awareness. In the past year or so, more than 600 women in the commune have joined the Communist Party of China, more than 1,700 have joined the Communist Youth League, and most of them have shaken off illiteracy.
    The collective welfare undertakings of the Red Flag People's Commune have also greatly developed, and the material and cultural living standards of the commune members have greatly improved. The commune has established more than 500 public canteens, more than 170 nurseries, and more than 370 service stations, and the 20,000 women who participate in work have basically gotten rid of the constraints of various housework. In order to meet the cultural needs of commune members, the commune has established 58 red professional spare-time schools and three technical schools. The commune's 31 libraries have more than 150,000 books, and people borrowing books are gathered together every time after work or on Sundays. The commune has also repaired and newly built a number of houses for commune members, and planted more than 2.4 million trees on dozens of streets, which has greatly improved the living conditions of commune members.

    贯彻为大工业、为人民生活和为农业生产服务的方针
    郑州红旗公社不断巩固壮大
    社办工厂产品种类已达一千七百多种，领导工作百分之九十以上由妇女担任
    本报讯　全国建立最早的城市人民公社之一——郑州市红旗人民公社，在不断发展、壮大和巩固中，日益显示出它的无比优越性和强大生命力。现在，这个城市人民公社的规模已经比它1958年建立的时候大了好几倍，拥有七个分社、十五万名职工和居民，以及机电、铸造、小五金、化工、被服等行业的一百多个工厂和各种集体福利机构。它的社办工厂有力地辅助着国营工厂的生产并供应着市场的需要，对当地的农业生产也作出了很大贡献。到8月份止，这个公社社办工厂的产品种类已达一千七百多种，比去年增加了五百多种，比建社初期的六十六种增加了二十六倍，劳动生产率也比去年提高了几倍，产品成本下降了30％。
    红旗人民公社是在贯彻公社生产为大工业，为人民生活和为农业服务的方针中，不断得到巩固和发展的。从今年年初开始，这个公社的中共委员会就根据城市人民公社要为大工厂、人民生活和农业生产服务的方针，在边发展、边整顿、边巩固、边提高的原则下，对社办工业进行了积极的整顿。在整顿、巩固、发展的过程中，坚决贯彻了勤俭办社的方针，他们广泛利用大工厂的下脚废料和废渣废水作为原料；在设备上，不能洋就土，不能大就小，做到了“一厂多用，一物多用，人尽其才，物尽其用”。管城分社利用大厂的废铁、废丝、废棕、碎布、面筋、粉渣等，制成了小五金、电焊条、棕床、酱油、味精、醋和小型家具四十多种。二里岗分社在为农业生产服务的思想指导下，根据地方国营制药厂的急切需要，建立了纸袋、化工、木箱等七个卫星工厂，他们利用一切空闲时间，处理了制药厂几年来没有处理的许多废料，如碎木、破牛皮纸、蓖麻子、皂角子、干子土、旧纸心筒等，又为农药厂生产了主要的辅助材料纸袋、木箱、硫酸罐等四百七十多万个，使农药厂这些过去需要到吉林、山东、太原等地购买的原料和材料，在公社的帮助下得到了解决，光运费就可节约十四万元。二里岗分社的社办工业产品在为大厂服务中也得到了很大的发展。为了满足城市人民生活需要，8、9月份，红旗人民公社开展了一个清查仓库和向一切废料要小百货的群众性的运动，结果使小百货生产增加了三百四十八种。
    红旗人民公社的社员们在支援农业上表现了极大的热情，1至7月份，全社为农业生产了四千多吨化肥和两千多部水泵、电动机、锅驼机以及其它农具。公社最近还举行了一次“全民支援农业劳动日”的活动，组织了四万名居民和汽车、马车、架子车到郊区生产队参加劳动和运输。这一天，他们为农业生产队运肥三百多万斤，拔草六千多亩，修理了五十部大型农业机械。现在，全社人民正广泛地开展“为农业办一件好事”运动。
    这个公社的各行各业广泛深入地开展了技术革新和技术革命运动，对社办工业的巩固和发展起了很大作用。由于社办工业的技术条件差，设备简陋，手工操作比例大，而生产任务又比较紧迫，这就更加激发起职工改变现状的强烈要求。他们在很短的时间内，就提出了六万多条革新建议，有四万多条付诸实现，使全社社办工业的机械化水平有了很大提高。如铸造厂职工利用废料和代用品制成了土刨车、砂轮机、六尺自动元车、电钻和铣槽机等四十四件机器设备，其中铣槽机制成后就使工效提高一百六十倍。
    红旗人民公社在发展和巩固过程中培养出了一批干练的妇女队伍。在全社劳动力中，妇女占85％以上，现在公社的一百多个工厂和各个集体福利机构的主要负责人，如厂长、党支部书记、食堂主任、托儿所所长等90％以上都由妇女担任。她们在人民公社化前都是普通的家庭妇女，由于公社党委采取了一系列措施加强对她们的培养和她们自己的努力，她们很快就掌握了技术，提高了办事本领和政治觉悟。全社一年多来已有六百多名妇女参加了中国共产党，一千七百多人参加了共青团，大部分人摘掉文盲帽子。
    红旗人民公社的集体福利事业也有了很大的发展，社员的物质和文化生活水平有了很大提高。全社成立了五百多个公共食堂、一百七十多个托儿所、三百七十多个服务站，参加工作的两万名妇女，基本上都摆脱了各种家务牵累。为了满足社员文化生活的需要，公社建立了五十八所红专业余学校和三所技术学校，公社的三十一个图书馆藏书十五万多册，每到下班时间或星期天，借书的人济济一堂。公社还为社员补修和新盖了一批住房，在几十条街道上，植树二百四十多万株，使社员的居住条件得到不少改善。（附图片）
