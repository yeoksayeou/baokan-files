Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 21st: In Hubei Province, 830,000 young and middle-aged people from all walks of life have rushed to the front line of agricultural production, playing a vital role in the current autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing.

    In the mass movement of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, the Communist Youth League organizations at all levels in Hubei Province actively carried out education among the broad masses of young people, focusing on loving agricultural labor and striving to build a socialist countryside. This greatly enhanced the communist consciousness of the youth. Thousands upon thousands of young people from all walks of life have requested the Party and the government to go to the forefront of agricultural production. According to statistics from Xiangyang and Enshi prefectures alone, more than 39,800 educated youth have returned to their hometowns for production. In many areas, there has been a warm atmosphere of parents sending their children and husbands sending their wives, vying to sign up.

    After arriving at the forefront of agricultural production, the young people actively participated in the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing, becoming a vigorous shock force for vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. In the Bali Management Area of the Bali People's Commune in Hongan County, twenty-one educated youths who returned to their hometowns for production actively participated in agricultural labor during the day, and took the initiative to help commune members record work points and learn culture in the evening. They also used various forms to publicize the Party's policies to the masses, and were praised by the Party branch and commune members as "shock troops in production, propaganda teams in policy, and pioneers in eliminating illiteracy." After Lu Xiangtang, a member of the Communist Youth League from the central store of the Qichun Shizikou Commune, went to the first production team of the commune, he conscientiously took the lead in labor, study, experimentation, and running the canteen. In the past three months, he has accumulated more than 1,200 work points, led the youth to reclaim 87 mu of wasteland, and set up 49 mu of radish, rapeseed, and wheat experimental fields, with each person accumulating more than 100 dan of manure, which powerfully promoted the autumn plowing and sowing work of this production team.

    The young people were warmly welcomed and helped by the commune members in the countryside. When the young people first arrived in the countryside, many communes and teams held welcome meetings and heart-to-heart talks to welcome them, enthusiastically introducing them to the local production and living conditions, preparing housing and tools for them, and helping them learn agricultural technology. The Party and League organizations of the Bali Commune in Hongan County promptly invited a group of veteran farmers to teach them technology, based on the characteristics of the returning educated youth's lack of production experience. The League branch of the Xinsheng Production Team of the Donggou Farm in Yacheng County's Yahu Commune assisted the Party organization in making proper arrangements for the lives and production of the returning youth, which further encouraged the youth's enthusiasm for production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 21st: A group of new-type young farmers who love the countryside and build the countryside, represented by Hu Ruixiang and other eleven youths, have emerged in the rural areas of Hubei Province. Recently, these eleven youths were commended by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League. They are: Hu Ruixiang, Wang Dawan, Li Xiuqing, Wang Shizhong, Wang Huiying, Wang Weime, Liu Daowen, Huang Jixian, Yang Ronglin, Deng Shaoyu, and Zhang Pinggui. Some came from factories or schools, and some grew up in the countryside. Most of them are educated youth who can write and calculate.

    Their common characteristics are: resolutely listening to the Party, loving the countryside, loving agricultural production, determined to be red in the countryside, experts in the countryside, and working in the countryside for a lifetime. Hu Ruixiang, the daughter of a poor peasant who had attended one year of junior high school, and Li Xiuqing, a junior high school graduate who grew up in the city, responded to the Party's call in 1957 and settled in a farm with their mothers. In the countryside, they were not afraid of getting dirty, tired, or suffering. They conscientiously participated in agricultural production and tenaciously learned agricultural technology. After Hu Ruixiang chose to live in the most backward production team, she immediately took the lead in forming a shock team, appearing wherever there were difficulties. Under the leadership of the Party and her leading influence, this production team quickly changed its backward appearance and became a red banner production team in the farm. Wang Dawan, a technician from the Wuhan Automobile Factory, persuaded his father and signed up to go to the countryside to serve agriculture. The small factories in the countryside had poor equipment and many difficulties, so he led everyone to find ways and shortcuts to produce and assemble a large number of agricultural tools to support agricultural production. Wang Weime, a young farmer, had his father-in-law find him a job with a monthly income of fifty or sixty yuan, asking him to leave the countryside and work in the city. But Wang Weime firmly replied, "I'm not going. The Party needs me in the countryside, so I will stay in the countryside and build the countryside." In this way, they adhered to the direction guided by the Party, dedicating their wisdom and strength to the socialist construction of the countryside, and were therefore welcomed by the masses.

    On the agricultural production front, these advanced youths displayed a spirit of hard struggle, diligently studied and researched, and boldly innovated agricultural technology, making outstanding achievements. Wang Shizhong, a young farmer, had only studied for two winters and had been herding cattle for landlords before liberation. After liberation, he tenaciously persisted in amateur study, participating in production while completing the main courses from elementary school to university. He also applied the scientific knowledge he had learned to production in a timely manner, trial-producing and innovating dozens of tools, and making significant achievements in rice high-yield experiments and variety breeding. The famous "Five Heroines" girls, led by Wang Huiying in Zhuxi County, settled on Banyanzi Mountain, more than 2,000 meters above sea level, two years ago, and painstakingly studied the technology of cultivating Coptis chinensis. They planted more than 30 sheds of Coptis chinensis on this inaccessible mountain, building it into a base for producing Coptis chinensis, and also planted buckwheat and radishes and raised pigs there.

    These young people worked diligently in the countryside, made achievements in production, and were loved by the local people, who called them "good sons and daughters of the Party and Chairman Mao" and "good examples for young people." The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League decided to launch a mass movement among the youth in the province to learn from and catch up with Hu Ruixiang and other eleven red banner pacesetters, leading the youth to play a greater role in vigorously developing agriculture and grain production.

    热爱农村热爱农业生产　决心红在农村专在农村
    湖北八十三万青壮年回乡生产
    胡瑞香等十一名青年已经成为建设农村的新型农民
    新华社武汉21日电　湖北省已经有八十三万名各行各业的青壮年奔赴农业生产第一线，在当前的秋收、秋耕、秋种中发挥了突击作用。
    在大办农业、大办粮食的群众运动中，湖北省各级共青团组织在广大青年中积极开展了热爱农业劳动、发愤图强建设社会主义农村的教育，大大提高了青年的共产主义觉悟，成千上万的各行各业青年纷纷向党和政府要求到农业生产第一线去。仅据襄阳、恩施两个专区的统计，知识青年回乡生产的就有三万九千八百多人。不少地区还出现父母送儿女，丈夫送妻子，争相报名的热烈气氛。
    青年们到达农业生产第一线后，积极参加秋收、秋耕、秋种，成为大办农业，大办粮食的一支生气勃勃的突击力量。红安县八里人民公社八里管理区二十一名回乡生产的知识青年，白天积极参加农业劳动，晚上还主动帮助社员记工分、学文化，并且运用各种形式向群众宣传党的方针政策，被党总支和社员们称赞为“生产中的突击队，政策上的宣传队，扫除文盲上的先锋队。”蕲春十字口公社中心商店共青团员吕向堂下到公社第一生产队后，认真带头劳动、带头学习、带头试验、带头办食堂，三个月来已做劳动工分一千二百多个，带领青年突击开荒八十七亩，办起萝卜、油菜、小麦试验地四十九亩，每人积肥一百多担，有力地推动了这个生产队的秋耕、秋种工作。
    青年们在农村里受到了社员们的热烈欢迎和帮助。青年们刚到农村的时候，许多社、队开欢迎会、谈心会欢迎他们，热情地为他们介绍本地的生产和生活情况，为他们准备了住房、工具，帮助他们学习农业技术。红安县八里公社党和团的组织根据回乡知识青年缺乏生产经验的特点，及时请了一批老农向他们传授技术。鄂城县鸭湖公社东沟农场新生生产队团支部，协助党组织对回乡青年的生活和生产作了妥善安排，都进一步鼓舞了青年们的生产热情。
    新华社武汉21日电　在湖北省的农村里，已经涌现出一批以胡瑞香等十一名青年为代表的热爱农村建设农村的新型青年农民。最近，这十一名青年受到了共青团湖北省委员会的表扬，他们是：胡瑞香、王大万、李秀清、王时中、王惠英、王维么、刘道文、黄继先、杨荣林、邓绍钰和章平贵。有的来自工厂或学校，有的生长在农村，绝大部分都是能写会算的知识青年。
    他们的共同特点是：坚决听党的话，热爱农村，热爱农业生产，决心红在农村，专在农村，在农村干一辈子。念过一年初中的贫农女儿胡瑞香和在城市长大的初中毕业生李秀清，两人在1957年就响应党的号召，带着自己的母亲到一个农场里安家落户。在农村里，她们不怕脏、不怕苦、不怕累，认真参加农业生产，顽强地学习农业技术。胡瑞香选最落后的生产队住下来后，立即带头成立突击队，那里有困难就出现在那里。在党的领导和她的带头影响下，这个生产队很快改变了落后面貌，一跃而为农场里的红旗生产队。武汉汽车厂技术工人王大万说服了他的父亲，报名到农村去为农业服务。农村的小工厂设备差、困难多，他就带动大家想办法、找窍门，生产和装配了大量农具，支援了农业生产。青年农民王维么的岳父为他找到了每月有五、六十元收入的工作，要他离开农村到城里工作。但王维么坚定地回答说：“我不去，党需要我在农村，我就要留在农村，建设农村。”就是这样，他们坚持着党指引的方向，把自己的智慧和力量献给农村的社会主义建设，因而受到了群众的欢迎。
    在农业生产战线上，这些先进青年发挥了艰苦奋斗的精神，苦学苦钻，大胆革新农业技术，作出了出色的成绩。青年农民王时中原来只念过两个冬天的书，解放前一直给地主家放牛。解放后他顽强地坚持业余学习，一边参加生产，一边学完了从小学到大学的主要课程，并且把所学的科学知识及时地运用到生产中去，试制和革新了几十种工具，在水稻丰产试验和品种培育方面作出了显著的成绩。竹溪县以王惠英为首的著名的“五英”姑娘，两年前从平川来到海拔二千多米的板岩子山上定居，刻苦地学习培育黄连的技术，她们在这座人迹罕到的山上种了三十多棚黄连，把那里建设成了一个生产黄连的基地，并且在那里种了荞麦、萝卜，养了猪。
    这些青年在农村中踏踏实实地劳动，在生产上作出成绩，受到了当地人民的热爱，被人们称为“党和毛主席的好儿女”，“青年的好榜样”。共青团湖北省委员会决定在全省青年中掀起一个学、赶胡瑞香等十一名红旗标兵的群众运动，领导青年们在大办农业大办粮食中发挥更大的作用。
