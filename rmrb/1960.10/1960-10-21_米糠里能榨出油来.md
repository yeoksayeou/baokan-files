Oil Can Be Squeezed from Rice Bran
Worker of Shanghai Fuhua Weaving Factory, Huang Zhichang

In the old society, the saying "You can't squeeze oil from rice bran" shackled the intelligence of countless people.

After liberation, times have changed, language has changed, and things that were long considered "impossible" are now "possible." On September 2nd, the People's Daily had a news item: Guangdong Province has widely promoted rice bran oil extraction and achieved great results. According to statistics, state-owned grain processing departments throughout the province produced more than 17.7 million jin of bran oil from the second half of last year to the first half of this year, refining more than 14 million jin of edible oil, equivalent to the oil yield of planting 400,000 mu of peanuts. It can be seen that the saying "You can't squeeze oil from rice bran" should be sent to the museum.

However, in the campaign for increasing production and practicing economy, with grain and steel as the center, we can still hear a few comrades whispering behind their backs: "Increasing production and practicing economy has been going on for years, and it's almost done. You can't squeeze oil from rice bran anymore."

Facts speak louder than words. Now, let the facts speak for themselves. The "crotch" of the athletic pants produced in our factory were relatively large in the early years, which not only wasted a lot of valuable cotton cloth, but also made consumers uncomfortable to wear. Later, after repeated discussions and studies, we came to a consensus on the "swallowtail crotch" athletic pants, which used the least material, had the best appearance, and were most popular with consumers. At that time, some people also thought: "This time the potential has been exhausted, and there is no more oil to be squeezed."

The Party has repeatedly taught us: "There is no limit to the upstream, and the potential can never be exhausted." Listening to the Party is never wrong. Recently, the master craftsmen in our factory's cutting workshop have repeatedly broken the "potential exhaustion theory," using their brains to the fullest extent, and once again revolutionized the "swallowtail crotch," finally finding a way to piece together the crotch with scrap material, saving whole material. In this way, with a little brainstorming, each dozen athletic pants can save another seven centimeters of raw cloth, and half a dozen more can be made for every hundred dozen. If calculated at 100,000 dozen, 500 more dozen athletic pants can be made. The facts have given a vivid lesson to those who say "You can't squeeze oil from rice bran."

Those who say "You can't squeeze oil from rice bran" actually have no "oil" themselves—they lack political enthusiasm. Workers often say, "Use your brain." The brain, like a machine, needs to be used more often to become smarter and more flexible, and the ideas will become broader, and there will be more "oil." If a person lacks full political enthusiasm and does things perfunctorily, the brain, like a machine, is too lazy to move, or afraid to move, and as a result, it rusts. In this way, naturally, they feel that no oil can be squeezed from rice bran.

There is a lot of oil in rice bran! The key is whether you put your hands to squeezing it!

### 米糠里能榨出油来

    米糠里能榨出油来
    上海富华织造厂工人　黄炽昌
    “米糠里榨不出油来”这句口头禅，在旧社会里不知束缚了多少人的聪明才智。
    解放了，时代变了，语言也变了，过去长期认为“做不到”的事现在却“做得到”了。9月2日人民日报就有一条消息：广东省普遍推广米糠榨油取得巨大成绩。据统计，全省国营粮食加工部门由去年下半年起到今年上半年止，已生产糠油一千七百七十多万斤，提炼食油一千四百多万斤，等于种植四十万亩花生的产油量。可见，“米糠里榨不出油来”这句话，应该送进博物馆去了。
    可是，在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，我们仍旧可以听到少数同志在背后议论：“增产节约年年搞，早已搞得差不多了，米糠里榨不出油来了。”
    事实胜于雄辩。现在，就请事实出来说话。我们厂里生产的球裤早几年的“裤裆”都是比较大的，这样，不但浪费不少宝贵的棉布，连消费者穿了也不舒适。后来，经过一而再、再而三地研究讨论，得出了一致公认的用料最省、样子最好、最受消费者欢迎的“燕尾裆”球裤。当时，也有些人认为：“这下子潜力挖光了，油水没有了。”
    党一再教导我们：“上游无止境，潜力挖不尽。”听党的话一点不会错。最近，我厂裁剪间的老师傅们一再打破“潜力挖光论”，大动脑筋，对“燕尾裆”再一次革命，终于找到了用零料拼裆的办法，节约整料，这样，脑筋一动，每打球裤又可以节约坯布七厘米，每百打就可以多做半打。假如以十万打计，可以多做球裤五百打。事实给“米糠里榨不出油来”论者上了生动的一课。
    那些叫“米糠里榨不出油”的人，事实是他自己没有“油”——缺乏政治热情。工人常说：“动脑筋”。脑筋这东西也要像机器一样多开动开动，才会越动越聪明，越动越灵活，思路也越动越开阔，“油”也越动越足。一个人如果缺乏饱满的政治热情，做事得过且过，脑筋这部机器懒得去动，或者怕动，结果却生了锈，这样，自然就觉得米糠里榨不出油了。
    米糠里油水大得很！关键在于你是否动手去榨！
