Xinhua News Agency, 4th. More than one thousand people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand meeting at the Capital Theater this afternoon to warmly welcome the close comrades-in-arms from the brotherly nation—the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association Delegation headed by Abdyl Këllezi, Member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Chairman the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association.

Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice-Premiers of the State Council, and Jiang Nanxiang, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee and President of the Chinese-Albanian Friendship Association, attended the meeting.

Misto Treska, Chairman of the Albanian Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations, Shefki Musaraj, Secretary-General of the Albanian Writers and Artists Association, Albanian writers A. Abdihoxha, and Albanian Ambassador to China, Piro Koçi, and embassy staff, who are currently visiting our country, were invited to attend the meeting.

Today, the Capital Theater was decorated solemnly and beautifully. The national flags of China and Albania were hung side by side in the center of the rostrum, with evergreen palm trees placed on the stage, and the front of the stage was filled with blooming autumn chrysanthemums. The huge banner "Long Live the Fraternal Friendship Between the Chinese and Albanian People" hung high opposite the rostrum, glittering with golden light. When Vice-Chairman Këllezi, accompanied by Vice-Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, President Jiang Nanxiang, and others, stepped onto the rostrum, the audience burst into prolonged, storm-like applause, expressing a fraternal and warm welcome to Comrade Këllezi, the friendly envoy of the heroic and battle-tested Albanian people, and other Albanian guests.

Jiang Nanxiang, Alternate Member of the CPC Central Committee and President of the Chinese-Albanian Friendship Association, first spoke at the meeting, extending the warmest welcome to the distinguished guests of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association Delegation led by Comrade A. Këllezi, and expressing the most lofty respect to the fraternal Albanian people.

Jiang Nanxiang said that the Albanian people, known for their strength, courage, and rich tradition of revolutionary struggle, are deeply respected by the people of all countries. During the period of occupation by Italian and German fascists, the heroic Albanian people, under the strong leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, fought heroically and tenaciously against the most vicious enemy of the world at that time, and finally, in coordination with the Soviet army, defeated the Hitler bandit gang’s victorious advance. They drove out the fascist aggressors with their own armed forces and won the freedom and independence of their motherland, opening up a bright road to socialism for Albania. The struggle of the Albanian people made a valuable contribution to the world's anti-fascist war.

Jiang Nanxiang listed the great achievements that the Albanian people have made in industry, agriculture, culture, and education under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party in the process of socialist construction. He said that the great achievements of the Albanian people most eloquently demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system and prove the complete correctness of the political line of the Albanian Labor Party, which is a great encouragement to the Chinese people who are building their own socialist motherland. Jiang Nanxiang said that the brilliant example of Albania tells us an important truth: no matter the size of a country, no matter the strength of its past economic foundation, as long as there is correct leadership from a Marxist-Leninist party, as long as the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of people is correctly promoted, and as long as the entire party and people rely on each other, are of one heart and one mind, and work hard, then they will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties and turn the great ideal of building socialism into a living reality.

Jiang Nanxiang warmly praised the heroic Albanian people as a peace-loving people who have consistently made unremitting efforts to safeguard peace in the Balkan region and world peace, and have made important contributions. He said that the Albanian people have never harbored any unrealistic illusions about the enemy, dared to thoroughly expose and resolutely counter the aggressive activities and war conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its followers, warmly sympathized with the oppressed nations and exploited classes, and actively supported the national liberation struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism for democracy and freedom. The brave, firm, and upright revolutionary stance of the Albanian people has won the infinite respect of peace-loving people and those striving for independence and freedom around the world!

Jiang Nanxiang emphasized that the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha is a vibrant, fighting Marxist-Leninist party, a party that is flesh and blood with the masses. The glorious Albanian Labor Party and Albanian people have consistently held high the brilliant banner of Marxism-Leninism, are loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism, firmly defend the Moscow Declaration of the twelve Communist and Workers' Parties, and unremittingly wage a resolute and irreconcilable struggle against modern revisionism represented by the Tito clique of Yugoslavia, in order to strengthen the great unity of the socialist camp. He said that the heroic Albanian people have demonstrated the heroic spirit of the revolutionary proletariat in the struggle, and are sincerely loved and admired by the Chinese people.

Jiang Nanxiang said that the people of China and Albania have a common ideological basis, and we are all loyal to Marxism-Leninism; we have a common political line, and we are both unyieldingly engaged in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism; we have common class feelings, and we are fighting side by side, sharing weal and woe, and going through thick and thin together to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, to safeguard the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to defend peace. Therefore, the friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people is the closest, immortal, and unbreakable.

Jiang Nanxiang's speech repeatedly aroused warm, thunderous applause.

Chairman Këllezi spoke at the meeting. He said: As soon as the delegation set foot on the land of People's China, it was surrounded by boundless love, and the delegation was warmly welcomed everywhere. This welcome expressed the love of the brotherly Chinese people for the Albanian people, the Party, and the government. He said: Chinese-Albanian friendship is deeply rooted because it is based on the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

Chairman Këllezi said that the Albanian people infinitely love the heroic brotherly Chinese people, the glorious Chinese Communist Party, and its outstanding leader, the long-tested Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong.

Chairman Këllezi praised the amazing achievements of New China. He said that these great achievements cannot be obliterated by anyone. China's achievements are great achievements for the entire socialist camp, and all of China's friends around the world are delighted by these achievements. Only the imperialists, headed by the United States—the world's imperialist gendarme—and modern revisionists, represented by the Belgrade revisionist traitors, slander your country. They try to bury these achievements because they are afraid of this great development, afraid that the oppressed people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the world will find support and encouragement in this development.

Chairman Këllezi said that the reason why China has achieved these achievements is the immortal thought of Marxism-Leninism with which the glorious Chinese Communist Party has tempered itself, and the consistently correct political, ideological, and economic line of the Chinese Communist Party under the wise and steady leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong.

He said that while faithfully implementing the principles of Marxism-Leninism, the Chinese Communist Party is building a new life—socialism—in accordance with China's specific conditions. China has rapidly become a powerful socialist country and a powerful pillar for maintaining the unity of the socialist camp and the world communist and workers' movement. The Albanian people regard these achievements as their own achievements and as achievements of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

In his speech, Chairman Këllezi talked about Albania's great achievements in all aspects of socialist construction. It has moved from a backward country to the ranks of advanced countries. He said that the source of these achievements is the immortal thought of Marxism-Leninism, and our glorious Labor Party headed by the founder of the Party and Marxist-Leninist Comrade Hoxha. He said: Our Party has always implemented its correct Marxist-Leninist line throughout its revolutionary course. The Party has never wavered, and will never waver, in its Marxist-Leninist position.

He said that our enemies—the imperialists and their agents, the Yugoslav revisionists—have tried every possible means to undermine the Party's ties with the people, to divide our Party with slander, defamation, the hostile activities of Party traitors, sabotage, and the dispatch of special agents, and by exerting pressure, but they have always failed and will continue to fail.

Chairman Këllezi said: An unbreakable friendship connects the Albanian and Chinese people. This friendship is deep and has been forged over a long period of time by our two parties, Comrade Hoxha, and Comrade Mao Zedong. Both the Albanian and Chinese people cherish the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and both struggle for the purity of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, exposing the warmongers headed by the United States, and opposing modern revisionism, especially Yugoslav revisionism as an agent of imperialism. He emphasized: As pointed out by the 1957 Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties, revisionism is the main danger in the current world communist and workers' movement.

In his speech, Chairman Këllezi also severely condemned the position of the U.S.-led imperialist bloc in unreasonably obstructing our country's legitimate status in the United Nations, and the criminal activities of U.S. imperialism in occupying our territory of Taiwan. He pointed out that the People's Republic of China, with its consistent peaceful policy, has become an important factor in defending world peace and security. The treaties of non-aggression and friendship signed by the government of the People's Republic of China and many Asian and African countries are new evidence of the People's Republic of China's peaceful policy. Chairman Këllezi's speech continuously aroused warm and lasting applause from the audience.

At the end of his speech, Chairman Këllezi enthusiastically shouted "Long live Chinese-Albanian friendship!" in Chinese and warmly embraced President Jiang Nanxiang. At this time, the audience stood up and once again burst into prolonged and thunderous applause.

Also present at today's welcome meeting were: Zeng Shan, Member of the CPC Central Committee; Luo Guibo, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs; Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries; Liu Mingfu, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission; Lin Haiyun, Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade; He Biao and Liu Baiyu, Vice-Presidents of the Chinese-Albanian Friendship Association; and Beijing-based directors of the Association Lü Ji, Sa Kongliao, Lin Qiaozhi, Yang Xiandong, Chen Bo, and people from all walks of life in the capital Xu Zhizhen, Xu Guangping, and Yang Haibo, etc.

Albanian students in Beijing were also invited to attend today's meeting.

After the welcome meeting, Chairman Këllezi and other Albanian guests watched the wonderful performances "Five Red Clouds" and "Havoc in the Dragon Palace" performed by Chinese artists. After the performance, Chairman Këllezi, accompanied by Vice-Premier Li Fuchun, went onto the stage and cordially shook hands with the Chinese actors one by one. (Attached photo)

    向来自兄弟之邦—英雄的阿尔巴尼亚的亲密战友致敬
    首都盛会欢迎阿中友协代表团
    凯莱齐副主席痛斥帝国主义现代修正主义，赞扬中国建设成就
    李富春李先念副总理出席大会，中阿友协会长蒋南翔在会上讲话
  新华社4日讯　首都各界群众一千多人，今天下午在首都剧场举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎来自兄弟之邦的亲密战友——以阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、部长会议副主席、阿中友协主席阿卜杜勒·凯莱齐为首的阿尔巴尼亚中国友好协会代表团。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李富春、李先念，中共中央候补委员、中阿友协会长蒋南翔出席了大会。
    正在我国访问的阿尔巴尼亚对外文化联络委员会主席米斯托·特雷斯卡和阿尔巴尼亚作家艺术家协会秘书长谢夫卡特·穆萨莱，阿尔巴尼亚作家阿·阿布迪霍查和阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使帕里夫蒂以及大使馆人员应邀出席了大会。
    今天，首都剧场布置得庄严、美丽。主席台正中并排高挂着中国阿尔巴尼亚两国国旗，台上摆着长青的棕榈树，台前布满盛开的秋菊。主席台对面高悬的“中阿两国人民的兄弟友谊万岁”的巨幅标语闪烁着金光。当凯莱齐副主席在李富春李先念副总理，蒋南翔会长等陪同下走上主席台时，全场响起了长时间的暴风雨般的掌声，向英勇的久经战斗考验的阿尔巴尼亚人民的友好使者凯莱齐同志和其他阿尔巴尼亚贵宾们表示兄弟般的热烈欢迎。
    中共中央候补委员，中阿友好协会会长蒋南翔首先在会上讲话，向阿·凯莱齐同志率领的阿中友协代表团的贵宾们，表示最热烈的欢迎，向兄弟般的阿尔巴尼亚人民表示最崇高的敬意。
    蒋南翔说，阿尔巴尼亚人民向以坚强、勇敢、富有革命斗争传统而深深地受到各国人民的尊敬。在意大利和德国法西斯侵占时期，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的坚强领导下，同当时世界人民最凶恶的敌人进行了英勇顽强的战斗，终于配合苏联军队击溃希特勒匪帮的胜利进军，用自己的武装力量赶走了法西斯侵略者，争得了自己祖国的自由和独立。并且为阿尔巴尼亚开辟了走向社会主义的光明大道。阿尔巴尼亚人民的斗争对世界反法西斯战争作出了宝贵的贡献。
    蒋南翔列举了阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，在社会主义建设过程中工业、农业和文化教育等方面已经取得的巨大成就。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大成就，最雄辩地说明了社会主义制度的优越性，证明了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的政治路线的完全正确，这对正在建设自己社会主义祖国的中国人民，是一个巨大的鼓舞。蒋南翔说，阿尔巴尼亚的光辉榜样告诉我们一个重要的真理：不论国家大小，不论过去的经济基础强弱，只要有了马克思列宁主义政党的正确领导，只要正确地发扬广大人民群众的革命干劲，只要依靠全党全民，同心同德，艰苦奋斗，那么就一定能够战胜一切困难，把建设社会主义的伟大理想变成活生生的现实。
    蒋南翔热烈赞扬英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民是热爱和平的人民，一贯为维护巴尔干地区的和平和世界和平进行不懈的努力，并作出了重要的贡献。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民对敌人从来不抱任何不切实际的幻想，敢于彻底揭露和坚决反击美帝国主义及其追随者的侵略活动和战争阴谋，热烈同情被压迫的民族和被剥削的阶级；积极支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义争取民主和自由的民族解放斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民这种勇敢、坚定、光明磊落的革命立场，赢得了全世界爱好和平和争取独立和自由的人民的无限尊敬！
    蒋南翔强调说：以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是生气勃勃的战斗的马克思列宁主义的党，是同群众有血肉联系的党。光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民一贯高举马克思列宁主义的光辉旗帜，忠实于无产阶级国际主义原则，坚定地捍卫着十二国共产党和工人党的莫斯科宣言，坚持不懈地为加强社会主义阵营的伟大团结，同以南斯拉夫铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义进行着坚决的、毫不调和的斗争。他说，英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民在斗争中表现了革命无产阶级的英雄气概，受到中国人民的衷心爱戴和敬佩。
    蒋南翔说，我们中阿两国人民有共同的思想基础，我们都忠实于马克思列宁主义；我们有共同的政治路线，我们都不屈不挠地进行着反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争；我们有共同的阶级感情，我们为捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁，为维护以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，为保卫和平，并肩作战，风雨同舟，患难相共。因此，中阿两国人民的友谊，是最亲密的，不朽的，牢不可破的。
    蒋南翔的讲话，一再激起了热烈的雷鸣般的掌声。
    凯莱齐团长在会上讲话。他说：代表团一踏上人民中国的土地时，就被无限的热爱包围住了，代表团到处受到热烈欢迎，这种欢迎表达了兄弟的中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民、党和政府的热爱。他说：中阿友谊是根深蒂固的，因为它是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义不朽原则的基础之上的。
    凯莱齐团长说，阿尔巴尼亚人民无限热爱英雄的兄弟中国人民、光荣的中国共产党及其卓越的领袖、久经考验的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志。
    凯莱齐团长称赞新中国的惊人成就。他说，这些巨大成就是任何人抹杀不了的，中国的成就是整个社会主义阵营的巨大成就，中国在全世界的一切朋友都为这些成就感到欢欣鼓舞。只有以美国——世界帝国主义的宪兵——为首的帝国主义，以贝尔格莱德修正主义叛徒为代表的现代修正主义者才诬蔑你们国家。他们企图埋没这些成就，因为他们害怕这种巨大的发展，害怕亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲以及全世界受压迫的人民在这种发展中找到支持和鼓舞。
    凯莱齐团长说，中国取得这些成就的原因，就是光荣的中国共产党用以锻炼了自己的马克思列宁主义的不朽思想，就是在毛泽东同志英明而稳健的领导下的中国共产党的一贯正确的政治、思想和经济路线。
    他说，在忠实执行马克思列宁主义原则的同时，中国共产党根据中国的具体情况，正在建设着新的生活——社会主义。中国已迅速地成为一个强大的社会主义国家，成为一个维护社会主义阵营和世界共产主义和工人运动的团结的强大支柱。阿尔巴尼亚人民把这些成就，看成是自己的成就看成是以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的成就。
    凯莱齐团长在他的讲话中谈到了阿尔巴尼亚在社会主义建设中各方面的伟大成就。它已经从一个落后的国家进入先进国家的行列。他说，这些成就的泉源就是不朽的马克思列宁主义思想，是以党的奠基人、马克思列宁主义者霍查同志为首的我们光荣的劳动党。他说：我们的党在它整个的革命历程中，始终执行自己的正确的马克思列宁主义路线。党向来没有、也永远不会在它的马克思列宁主义阵地上有所动摇。
    他说，我们的敌人——帝国主义者及其代理人南斯拉夫修正主义者千方百计地企图破坏我们党同人民的联系，企图用诬蔑、诽谤、用党的叛徒的敌对活动，用破坏和派遣特务、用施加压力来分化我们的党，但他们一向都失败了，而且还将遭到失败。
    凯莱齐团长说：牢不可破的友谊把阿中两国人民连接在一起，这种友谊是深厚的，它得到了我们两党、霍查同志和毛泽东同志长时期的锤炼。阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民都珍惜以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，都为马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的纯洁而斗争，揭露以美国为首的好战分子，反对现代修正主义，特别是反对作为帝国主义代理人的南斯拉夫修正主义。他强调说：正如1957年莫斯科共产党和工人党代表会议所指出的，修正主义是当前世界共产主义和工人运动的最主要的危险。
    凯莱齐团长在讲话中还严厉谴责以美国为首的帝国主义集团无理阻挠我国在联合国的合法地位的立场和美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾的罪恶活动。他指出：中华人民共和国以其一贯的和平政策，成为保卫世界和平和安全的重要因素。中华人民共和国政府和许多亚非国家签订的互不侵犯和友好条约就是中华人民共和国和平政策的新的证明。凯莱齐团长的讲话，不断激起全场热烈的经久不息的掌声。
    凯莱齐团长在讲话结束时，用中国话热情地高呼：“中阿友谊万岁！”并和蒋南翔会长热烈拥抱。这时，全场起立，再一次响起了长时间的暴风雨般的掌声。
    今天出席欢迎大会的还有：中共中央委员曾山，外交部副部长罗贵波，对外文化联络委员会副主任张致祥，国家计划委员会副主任刘明夫，对外贸易部副部长林海云，中阿友好协会副会长贺彪、刘白羽和在京理事吕骥、萨空了、林巧稚、杨显东、陈播以及首都各界人士许之桢、许广平、杨海波等。
    在京的阿尔巴尼亚留学生也应邀出席了今天的大会。
