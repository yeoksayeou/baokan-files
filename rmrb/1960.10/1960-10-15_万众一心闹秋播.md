    United as One to Rush Autumn Planting
    Written Collectively by Correspondents of This Newspaper
    In these clear autumn days, the heartstrings of every Gansu person are being stirred by the call to "vigorously develop agriculture, vigorously develop grain"!
    As soon as the dawn breaks in the east, from the Dongzhiyuan of the old revolutionary base area of Longdong to the Bailong River in the mountainous area of Longnan, from the Hexi Corridor to Huajialing, the sound of the drills sowing winter wheat, "Ka? Ka?", floats lightly in the sky; ox carts, horse carts, and handcarts transporting fertilizer and seeds never stop on the way. People, with the joy of the autumn harvest, are once again confidently plunged into an intense battle of wheat planting. In this intense battle, regardless of industry, occupation, urban or rural areas, workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers are united as one, working together to contribute more to reaping a greater summer grain harvest next year.
    Dongzhiyuan People Send Deep Affection from Afar
    Dongzhiyuan is a famous "granary" on the Loess Plateau. Standing on this vast and rich land, looking around, the heavy, golden-orange millet lies stretched out on the ridges of the fields; the plowed stubble fields reveal their moist faces, smiling to welcome the seeds of harvest sown by the people. At this tense moment, the CPC Pingliang Municipal Committee called, inviting Zhao Zuqi and Wang Zuoren, two skilled drill operators, to teach winter wheat sowing techniques. The people of Dongzhiyuan agreed generously.
    Zhao Zuqi and Wang Zuoren came to Pingliang City with the entrustment of the people of Dongzhiyuan, bringing the best three-row drills. Zhao Zuqi is a skilled drill operator from the Xingrong Production Team of the Xiaojin People's Commune, and Wang Zuoren is an expert in drill operation from the Advanced Production Team. Along the way, they protected the three-row drills very carefully. There is a short story about these three-row drills: After Zhao Zuqi received the commune's notice asking him to go to Pingliang City to teach drilling techniques, he happily ran to the farm tool storage room, thinking that he was going a long way to teach techniques, so he couldn't go without a good drill! Before he reached the storage room, he met the captain carrying a three-row drill looking for him. The captain said excitedly, "Lao Zhao, I knew you were coming to get a drill to teach techniques, this is the glory of our team, and also the glory of the people of Dongzhiyuan, you must complete this task well!" As for Wang Zuoren, the secretary of the Party branch of the Advanced Production Team, brought a good drill at the same time as notifying him, and encouraged Wang Zuoren, saying, "The harvest of Pingliang City is our harvest, you must teach them the techniques well, and come back when you have completed the task." After they came to Pingliang City, they immediately went to the Jinghe People's Commune and the Caofeng People's Commune to teach sowing techniques, and the commune members praised them as "relatives from Dongzhiyuan."
    Cadres and Masses Work Together to Skillfully Plant Wheat
    We walked into the office of the Xilian Production Team of the Kongque Commune in Longxi County, the room was quiet.
    "Is the secretary in?" "No, he went to the fields to plant wheat with the commune members!" As we turned to walk out, we heard someone inside grumbling impatiently, "You can't find him in the room at this time!"
    This is a production team of eighty-six households. The eleven members of the management committee and the eight work team leaders, except for the accountant who goes to the fields to collect statistics and announce attendance rates, the secretary, captains, and members all carry autumn planting tools and work shoulder to shoulder with the commune members all day long, leading production. Party branch secretary Qiao Yingyun is a top-notch commander in this battle.
    This autumn, the "three autumns" tasks before them are: timely planting of more than 250 mu of winter wheat, plowing and turning nearly a thousand mu of summer and autumn stubble fields, and rushing to harvest the ripe summer and autumn fields, but the entire team has only more than 160 laborers participating in the "three autumns" work. This arduous task is like a heavy burden on the shoulders of Party branch secretary Qiao Yingyun. He was figuring out an account in his mind: according to the general progress, these farm works would take four months to complete, how could this work? Qiao Yingyun decided to ask experienced commune members for advice. Therefore, he personally convened a meeting of old peasants, cleverly arranged the labor force, and at the same time seized the opportunity to call on everyone to contribute ideas and ask for labor from the tools. This greatly stimulated the commune members' "skillful work" spirit. Because they manufactured suction stoves, vegetable cutting machines, and vegetable washing machines, which increased work efficiency by more than one time, the team's five canteens freed up a group of cooks and administrators, who directly invested in the front line of autumn planting. The twenty-one mountain plows purchased from the city as early as 1958 were also put into use.
    "Five Olds" Inspect Autumn Planting
    Feng Wangui, Chai Rulin, Li Gaotang, Gao Wenru, and Zheng Liuye, five old men from the Nuanquan Production Team of the Gulang Town Commune in Tianzhu, are all old peasants over sixty years old. They have production experience, are diligent in their legs and sharp in their eyes, are straightforward in their temperament, manage things when they see them, and speak their minds when they have something to say. Although they cannot do heavy work, they are unwilling to sit idle at home. They go to the fields and breeding yards every day to take a look, criticize when they find problems, and put forward opinions to the branch. Because of this, they are called the "Five Olds Inspection Team" by the commune members. They were rated as red flag pacesetters of the Gulang Town Commune.
    When sowing began, the old men were even more energetic, running their legs even more diligently, and they took the initiative to carefully inspect and guide almost every task. The commune party committee promoted water-seed drilling and sowing in the Lianquan Team, and the commune members were hitching carts and driving donkeys to transport water to the fields. At this time, Chai Rulin, Feng Wangui, and other three old men went to the Second Team and found that a piece of land was not fertilized. The old men seized on this problem and said to the members of the Second Team, "The Party requires us to produce well, but you are not fertilizing the land, how can that work?" The commune members felt that the old men were right, so every household set up urine vats and urine pots, and sent the accumulated urine fertilizer to the fields, mixing the urine and water together for a one-time application to the ground.

    万众一心闹秋播
    本报通讯员集体采写
    在这秋高气爽的日子里，每个甘肃人的心弦都被“大办农业，大办粮食”的号角激荡着！
    当东方的曙光刚一露头，从陇东老区的董志塬到陇南山区的白龙江畔，从河西走廊到华家岭上，播种冬麦的“咔?，咔?”耧声，轻盈地在长空里飘拂；运肥、送种子的牛车、马车和人拉车不绝于途。人们带着秋季收获的愉快，又信心十足地卷入一场紧张的种麦战斗。在这场紧张战斗中，不分行业，不分职别，不分城乡，工农商学兵拧成一股劲，齐心协力，为争取明年夏季收到更多夏粮多出一把力。
    董志塬人远途送深情
    董志塬，是黄土高原上著名的“粮仓”。我们站在这块辽阔富饶的大地上，举目四望，沉甸甸、黄橙橙的糜谷，舒展地躺倒在田埂上；犁过的茬田，露出湿润润的脸蛋，笑迎着人们撒下的丰收种籽。就在这个紧张的时刻，中共平凉市委打来电话，邀请赵祖琦和王佐仁两名摇耧能手，去传授冬小麦的下种技术。董志塬人毫不吝啬地答应了。
    赵祖琦、王佐仁带着董志塬人的嘱托，带了最好的三齿摇耧到平凉市来了。赵祖琦是肖金人民公社兴荣生产队的摇耧能手，王佐仁是先进生产队的摇耧行家。一路上，他俩把三齿摇耧保护得好好的。说起这三齿摇耧，还有一小段故事：赵祖琦接到公社要他到平凉市传授摇耧技术的通知后，高兴的三步并作两步一直往农具保管室跑，心想走远路去传授技术，不带张好耧咋行呢！他还没走到保管室，就遇见队长扛着三齿耧找他来了。队长兴奋地说：“老赵，我知道你要来取耧去传授技术，这是咱队的光荣，也是董志塬人的光荣，你可要好好完成这个任务呀！”再说王佐仁吧，先进生产队的党支部书记在通知他的同时，就带来了一张好耧，鼓励王佐仁说：“平凉市的丰收就是我们的丰收，你要好好给他们传授技术，啥时完成任务，啥时回来。”他俩来到平凉市以后，马上到泾河人民公社和草峰人民公社传授播种技术，社员们都称赞他们是“董志塬上来的亲人”。
    干群齐心合力巧种麦
    我们走进陇西县孔雀公社西联生产队的办公室，屋子里静悄悄的。
    “书记在不在？”“不在，同社员一道下地种麦去了！”当我们转身走出来的时候，听到里面的人不耐烦地嘀咕说：“这会儿你可就别想在屋里找到他罗！”
    这是一个八十六户人家的生产队。管理委员会的十一名委员、八个作业队长，除会计下地统计数字、公布出勤率外，书记、队长、委员都成天扛着秋种工具跟社员并肩劳动，领导生产。党支部书记乔映云就是这个战斗中顶呱呱的一名指挥员。
    今秋，摆在面前的“三秋”任务是：适时播种二百五十多亩冬小麦，耕翻近千亩夏秋田茬地，抢收夏秋黄熟田，但全队参加“三秋”工作的劳动力只有一百六十多。这个艰巨的任务，像一副沉重的担子，压在党支部书记乔映云的肩上。他的心中捉摸着一笔账：按一般进度，这些农活得花四个月才能干完，这怎么行呢？乔映云决定向有经验的社员们请教。于是，他就亲自召开老农会，巧妙地安排了劳力，同时趁热打铁，号召人人献计，向工具要劳力。这样，大大激发了社员们的“巧干”精神。由于制造出吸风灶、切菜机、洗菜机，提高工效一倍以上，全队五个食堂因此而腾出了一批炊事员、管理员，直接投入了秋播第一线。早在1958年从城里购进来的二十一部山地犁，大家也用起来了。
    “五老”检查秋种
    天祝古浪镇公社暖泉生产队的冯万贵、柴如林、李高堂、高文儒、郑六爷五个老人，都是六十岁以上的老农。他们有生产经验，腿勤眼尖，脾气直爽，见事就管，有话就说。他们虽做不动重活，但也不愿意闲蹲在家里，每天都要到地里转转，饲养院看看，发现问题就批评，有意见就向支部提出。由于这样，他们被社员称为“五老检查团”。被评为古浪镇公社的红旗标兵。
    播种开始了，老人们的干劲更足了，腿跑得更勤了，几乎每一项任务，他们都要主动地细心检查、指导。公社党委在联泉队推广了带水籽耧播种，社员们套着车，赶着驴，往地里运水。这时候，柴如林、冯万贵等三个老人，到了二小队，发现有一块地里没上肥料。老人们就抓住这个问题，对二小队的社员说：“党要求我们好好生产，你们地里却不上肥料，那还能行？”社员们觉得老人说的有道理，就家家户户设立了尿缸、尿盆，把积的尿肥送到地里，用尿和水混合起来，一次入地。
