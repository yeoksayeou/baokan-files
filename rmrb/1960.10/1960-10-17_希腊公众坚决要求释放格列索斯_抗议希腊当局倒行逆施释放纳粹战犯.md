Xinhua News Agency, Athens, 14th: On the occasion of the 16th anniversary of the liberation of Athens, the Greek capital, from Hitler's occupation (October 13-14), the Greek Committee for the Defense of Democracy issued a statement demanding that the government immediately release Glezos and other patriotic democrats.

The statement said that the Greek public will never tolerate the situation where its national hero Glezos and other heroes who fought against the Hitlerite bandits are tortured in the gloomy medieval prisons of Greece, while Meeden, a Nazi war criminal who massacred a large number of Greek people, is pardoned and remains at large.

The Dafni Municipal Committee of Piraeus and the mayor of Pilisteri near Athens have demanded that the government immediately release Glezos.

A group of retired generals and officers who participated in the resistance movement, including three members of parliament, also issued a statement demanding the release of Glezos and other patriots.

"Dawn Daily" pointed out that the struggle for the freedom of Glezos and other democrats has entered an important stage. "Dawn Daily" appealed to the Greek and world public to immediately and resolutely demand their release.

Xinhua News Agency, Athens, 10th: Nazi war criminal Max Merten was recently released by the Greek government. After returning to West Germany, he revealed that Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis and his two ministers had been bribed and served the Hitlerite German military authorities. This incident has shocked Greek public opinion.

The Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party issued a statement on the 6th regarding this matter. The statement pointed out that Merten was one of the greatest war criminals who killed thousands of Greek patriots. In 1959, war criminal Merten was sentenced to 25 years in prison by the Greek court, but after serving only eight months, he was released back to West Germany by the Greek government. The statement emphasized that the people feel both angry and heartbroken that Nazi war criminals are released with the help of the Greek government, while the Greek national hero Glezos and other patriots are subjected to various persecutions by the government.

The statement pointed out that the Greek people must overthrow the Karamanlis government and restore the people's resistance movement. It called on the people to take united resistance actions and carry out a nationwide struggle.

    声明说，希腊公众绝不容忍这样的状况：它的民族英雄格列索斯以及同希特勒匪徒进行过斗争的其他英雄们在希腊中世纪的阴森的监狱里受折磨，而大批屠杀希腊人民的希特勒战犯梅登却被赦免，逍遥法外。
    比里犹斯的达菲纳市政委员会、雅典附近比利斯特里的市长都要求政府立即释放格列索斯。
    参加过抵抗运动的一批退伍将军和军官，其中有三名议员，也发表声明，要求政府释放格列索斯和其他爱国者。
    “黎明日报”指出，争取格列索斯和其他民主分子的自由的斗争，已经进入重要阶段。“黎明日报”向希腊和全世界公众呼吁：立即坚决地要求释放他们。
    据新华社10日讯　雅典消息：纳粹战犯马克斯·梅登最近被希腊政府释放。他在回到西德后透露，希腊首相卡拉曼利斯和他的两个大臣曾经被收买而为希特勒德国军事机关服务。这件事引起了希腊舆论的震动。
    希腊共产党中央委员会在6日就这件事发表了一项声明。声明指出，梅登是杀害数以千计的希腊爱国者的最大战犯之一。1959年战犯梅登被希腊法院判处二十五年徒刑，可是服刑刚及八个月就被希腊政府释放回西德。声明强调说，人民感到又愤怒又痛心的是，纳粹战犯在希腊政府的帮助下得到开释，而希腊民族英雄格列索斯及其他爱国者却遭到政府的种种迫害。
    声明指出，希腊人民必须打倒卡拉曼利斯政府和恢复人民抵抗运动。它号召人民采取联合的反抗行动并且进行全民的斗争。
