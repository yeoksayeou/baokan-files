Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 14th: Coal industry workers in Hebei Province are putting forth their utmost effort for steel production during the increase production and practice economy campaign, and production is flourishing. Since September, from large coal mines with a daily output of over 10,000 tons to small coal pits with a daily output of dozens of tons, all have comprehensively fulfilled the state plan. The quality of raw coal has also significantly improved. In September, the province's outward transfer of raw coal increased by more than 141,000 tons compared to August, strongly supporting the production of key steel enterprises.

The increase production and practice economy campaign on Hebei Province's coal industry front is being carried out both vigorously and practically. At the beginning of the increase production and practice economy campaign, many leading cadres of coal mines went deep into the grassroots, using various forms to educate workers about the important significance of carrying out a large-scale, high-yield, high-quality red flag competition movement for increasing grain and steel production. At the same time, many mines also adopted the method of grasping both ends, on the one hand, helping to summarize and promote the experiences of advanced groups; on the other hand, transferring key personnel to strengthen the leadership of backward groups and teams, and strengthening regular political and ideological work, so that the advanced become more advanced and the backward catch up with the advanced. Kailuan Coal Mine's Zhao Gezhuang Mine transferred 1,102 key members of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and activists to reinforce backward groups and teams, increasing the proportion of advanced groups in the mine from 34% in the past to over 72% in September, promoting the continuous rise of the mine's production level.

Relying on the masses, continuously summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, turning the inventions and creations of a few people into the wealth of everyone, and incorporating sporadic experiences into regulations after sorting and improvement, making them systematic and regular, is an important guarantee for the continuous leap forward in coal production in Hebei Province. In the past month or so, Hebei Province, from large coal mines to small coal pits, has summarized experiences at all levels through "production sports meets" and on-site performance competitions, establishing pace-setters, planting red flags, and carrying out counterpart competitions between groups, opponent competitions between individuals, and interlocking competitions between upper and lower processes. New achievements created by a class or group quickly became the goals pursued by all classes and groups, and new experiences created by a unit or a process quickly became the content learned by the entire factory. The Zhao Gezhuang Mine organized an advanced experience dissemination team composed of advanced pace-setters, who went to the coal mining area and the tunneling area to impart 75 effective advanced experiences through on-site performances. There were also 1,200 pace-setters who took the initiative to "settle" in backward groups and teams to help improve technical levels, generally increasing the labor productivity of backward groups by more than 30%, with the highest increasing by more than double.

In the increase production and practice economy campaign, Hebei Province also made full use of the technical strength and rich production management experience of large coal mines to support the comprehensive technical transformation of small coal pits. Up to now, more than 70% of the hoisting, underground and aboveground transportation, and other processes in the province's city and county-run small coal pits have been mechanized or semi-mechanized. By September 28, the province's city, county, and commune-run small coal pits had overfulfilled the annual production plan ahead of schedule by 95 days.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 14th: Since late September, the amount of coking coal transferred from Heilongjiang Province to key steel enterprises in various regions has continuously increased. The average daily loading volume in the first five days of October increased by more than 140 cars compared to the first and middle ten days of September. Now, hundreds of freight cars loaded with high-quality coking coal are heading to all parts of the country every day.

In order to transport large quantities of coal to the whole country as soon as possible, the Jixi, Shuangyashan, and Hegang coking coal bases in Heilongjiang Province have taken many effective measures. The Hegang Mining Bureau and the railway department transferred three main leading cadres to take charge of dispatching work in three shifts; more than 80 cadres from various sections were invested in various stations to help organize coal transportation, shortening the time vehicles stayed in the mines by 27.5%. After the Hegang Dongshan Mine built a landslide-style high platform that can accommodate 3,000 tons of coal, the mine's daily loading volume increased from 35 cars in the past to 64 cars, transporting more than 1,300 tons of coal per day. Workers in the No. 2, No. 4, and No. 5 coal bins of the Xingshan Mine reformed the coal loading methods and equipment, shortening the loading time from 30 minutes per car in the past to 3 minutes.

Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau, taking coal transportation as the key, vigorously grasped transportation organization work, achieving the goal of transporting all the coal produced daily by the five major coal mines within the management scope, namely Kailuan, Fengfeng, Jingxi, Jingxing, and Xinglong, and also transported a large amount of stored coal. The average daily coal transportation volume in September increased by 7.1% compared to August, and the average daily coal transportation volume in the first ten days of October increased by 9.4% compared to September, strongly supporting the production of steel smelting enterprises across the country.

The key to achieving the goal of transporting all the coal produced by the coal mines lies in supplying the coal mines with enough empty cars for loading coal. In order to expand the source of empty cars, they have taken the following four measures:

First, organize fast direct trains to speed up the turnover rate of vehicles. After reforming the transportation organization, now more than half of the coal cars in the bureau every day are fast direct trains.

Second, focusing on loading and unloading operations, a weak link, vigorously promote the "slippery" loading and unloading. Now, the high platforms of many stations along the line have been converted into landslide warehouses. Workers only need to pull the rope of the discharge gate, and the coal in the warehouse will automatically pour into the carriages. It used to take three to forty minutes to load a train of 30 tons of coal, but now it has been shortened to 25 seconds to 1 minute. In order to reduce the unloading time, new unloading equipment such as high roadbeds, automatic opening and closing doors, and mountain-shaped fixed car bottoms have been created on the basis of low freight positions. The time to unload a train of 30 tons of coal has also been reduced from 50 minutes to 10 to 20 minutes. These important technological innovation achievements are now being widely promoted throughout the bureau.

Third, a mass movement of clever loading and overloading was launched. Workers used methods such as improving packaging and rationally allocating light and heavy goods, so that each freight car carried more than one ton of goods more than the state plan, which is equivalent to increasing the number of 40-ton freight cars for the country by more than 200 every day.

Fourth, the various offices under the bureau organized communist-style large-scale collaboration. The Shijiazhuang Office is responsible for the coal transportation tasks of the Fengfeng and Jingxing coal mines, and is also responsible for transferring a part of the empty coal loading cars to neighboring bureaus. It needs a lot of empty cars, and the Beijing and Tianjin offices, which have insufficient sources of empty cars and also have heavy coal transportation tasks, took the initiative to compress their transportation volume of non-essential materials and transferred a large number of empty cars to support the Shijiazhuang Office's coal transportation.

This bureau also, in the spirit of leaving difficulties to oneself and providing convenience to others, put forward the slogan of "only allowing cars to wait for coal, not allowing coal to wait for cars," conscientiously implemented the reserve car system, and regularly stored a certain number of empty cars at the loading stations of various coal mines. This measure was warmly welcomed by the coal mine workers, who also put forward the slogan of "not letting cars wait for coal," stepping up the production of raw coal to improve the turnover rate of vehicles.

    河北大插红旗大树标兵煤产量旬旬上升
    黑龙江各焦煤基地狠抓运输调度外调焦煤不断增长
    北京铁路局组织高效率运输保证煤矿产多少运多少
    据新华社天津14日电　河北省煤炭工业战线的职工在增产节约运动中，全力为钢的劲头越来越大，生产蒸蒸日上。9月份以来，从日产上万吨的大煤矿到日产几十吨的小煤窑，都全面完成了国家计划。原煤质量也有显著提高。9月份全省外调原煤比8月份增加了十四万一千多吨，有力地支援了重点钢铁企业生产。
    河北省煤炭工业战线上的增产节约运动，开展的既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。许多煤矿的领导干部在增产节约运动一开始，就深入基层，通过各种形式，教育职工们认清开展大面积高产优质红旗竞赛运动对增产粮、钢的重要意义。同时，许多矿还采取抓两头的办法，一方面帮助总结和推广先进小组的经验；一方面抽调骨干，充实后进组、队的领导力量，加强经常性的政治思想工作，使先进的更加先进，后进的赶上先进。开滦煤矿赵各庄矿抽调了党、团员和积极分子一千一百零二名骨干力量，充实到落后组、队以后，使全矿先进小组的比例，由过去的34％增加到9月份的72％以上，推动了全矿生产水平日日上升。
    依靠群众，不断总结和推广先进经验，把少数人的发明创造变为大家的财富，使零星的经验，经过整理提高纳入规程，使之制度化、经常化，是河北省煤炭生产持续跃进的重要保证。一个多月来，河北省从大煤矿到小煤窑，通过“生产运动会”、现场表演赛等形式，层层总结经验，大树标兵，大插红旗，开展了组与组之间的对口赛，人与人之间的对手赛，上下工序之间的挂钩赛。一个班、组创造的新成绩，很快就成为各个班、组追赶的目标，一个单位一个工序创造的新经验，很快成为全厂学习的内容。赵各庄矿由先进标兵组成先进经验传播队，分别到采煤区、掘进区，用现场表演的办法，传授了七十五项行之有效的先进经验，还有一千二百名标兵主动到落后组队“落户”，帮助提高技术水平，使后进小组的劳动生产效率一般都提高了30％以上，最高的提高一倍多。
    河北省在增产节约运动中，还充分利用大煤矿的技术力量和丰富的生产管理经验，支援小煤窑进行全面技术改造。到目前为止，全省已有70％以上的市、县营小煤窑的提升，井下井上运输等工序实现了机械化、半机械化。到9月28日，全省市、县、公社营的小煤窑，已提前九十五天超额完成了全年生产计划。
    据新华社哈尔滨14日电　黑龙江省调往各地重点钢铁企业的炼焦煤，9月下旬以来不断增长。10月头五天的平均日装车量，比9月上、中旬增加了一百四十多车。现在，每天都有数百个车皮满载着优质焦煤奔向全国各地。
    黑龙江省鸡西、双鸭山、鹤岗各焦煤基地，为了尽快把大量煤炭运往全国，采取了很多有力措施。鹤岗矿务局和铁路部门抽调三个主要领导干部，分三班抓调度工作；有八十多名科室干部分别投入各车站，帮助组织煤炭运输，使车辆在矿停留时间缩短27.5％。鹤岗东山矿修建了一座能容纳三千吨煤的滑坡式高站台以后，全矿日装车量由过去的三十五车提高到六十四车，每天多运出一千三百多吨煤。兴山矿二井、四井、五井三个煤仓职工改革装车方法和设备，使装车时间由过去三十分钟装一车缩短到三分钟。
    据新华社14日讯　北京铁路局职工以运煤为纲，狠抓运输组织工作，做到管理范围内的开滦、峰峰、京西、井陉、兴隆五大煤矿每天产多少，运多少，并且运出了大量存煤，9月平均每天运煤量比8月增加了7.1％，10月上旬平均每天运煤量又比9月增加了9.4％，有力地支援了全国钢铁冶炼企业的生产。
    做到煤矿产多少，运多少，关键在于给煤矿供应足够的装煤空车。为了扩大空车来源，他们采取了以下四条措施：
    第一，组织快速直达列车，加快车辆的周转速度。经过革新运输组织，现在全局每天有一半以上的煤车都是快速直达列车。
    第二，针对装卸作业这一薄弱环节，大搞装卸滑溜化。现在沿线许多站的高站台，都已改成滑坡仓。工人只要拉开放闸门的绳索，仓内的煤便自动倾泻到车厢里。装一列三十吨煤的车，过去要三、四十分钟，现在已缩短到二十五秒钟到一分钟。为了减少卸车时间，又在低货位的基础上，创造了高路基、自动开关车门、山字形固定车底等新的卸车设备，卸一列三十吨煤车的时间，也由过去的五十分钟压缩到一、二十分钟。这些重要的技术革新成果，现正在全局大面积推广。
    第三，开展了一个巧装多载的群众运动，职工们用改善包装、轻重货物合理配装等办法，使每辆货车比国家计划多装了一吨多货物，这样就等于每天为国家增加了二百多辆四十吨的货车。
    第四，全局所属各办事处之间组织共产主义的大协作。石家庄办事处担负峰峰、井陉两大煤矿的运煤任务，又负责向邻局调送一部分装煤空车，需要很多空车，本身空车来源不足、运煤任务也很繁重的北京、天津两办事处，都主动压缩自己的非主要物资的运输量，调出大量空车支援石家庄办事处运煤。
    这个局还本着把困难留给自己，方便送给别人的精神，提出“只许车等煤，不许煤等车”的口号，认真执行备用车制度，在各煤矿装车站经常储备一定数量的空车。这一措施受到煤矿职工的热烈欢迎，他们也提出“不让车等煤”的口号，加紧生产原煤来提高车辆周转率。（附图片）
