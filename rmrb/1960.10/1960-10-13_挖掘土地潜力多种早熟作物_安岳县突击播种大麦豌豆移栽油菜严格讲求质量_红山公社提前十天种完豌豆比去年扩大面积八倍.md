Unearthing the potential of the land to plant more early-maturing crops
Anyue County rushes to sow barley and peas, transplants rapeseed, strictly emphasizing quality
Hongshan Commune completes pea planting ten days early, expanding area eightfold compared to last year

(Our report) According to Sichuan Daily: Since October 1st, Anyue County, Sichuan Province, has launched a concentrated campaign focused on sowing barley, "foreign wheat,"菜豌豆 (a type of pea) and transplanting rapeseed.

In order to ensure that next year's spring-harvested grains and rapeseed yield more than any previous year, the people's communes are both expanding the planting area and strictly emphasizing planting quality. They are adopting measures such as inspection, evaluation, and acceptance to ensure that the effective yield-increasing measures used in recent years, such as deep plowing and early soil preparation, applying sufficient base fertilizer, rational close planting, and selecting good seeds, are implemented in the sowing of spring crops. Before sowing, each commune conducted scientific treatment of the seeds of various crops; "foreign wheat" will be planted using wide-row strip planting and close spacing; at the same time, the number of rapeseed plants per mu will be ensured to meet the quality requirements. In order to transform peas and broad beans from low-yield to high-yield crops, each commune also insisted on deep plowing and fine soil preparation, and applying sufficient base fertilizer.

During the concentrated campaign, cadres from all county organs, factory and mine workers, school teachers and students, and urban residents all tried to devote time to this battle. Since October 1st, approximately 80% of the cadres in the county organs have been fighting on the front line of agriculture every day, working alongside the broad masses of commune members to rush sow spring crops.

(Our report) According to Hubei Daily: Hongshan People's Commune in Yingshan County, Hubei Province, has completed its task of planting 40,000 mu of peas ahead of schedule, expanding the pea planting area by more than eight times compared to last year. After layer-by-layer inspection and acceptance, narrow ridges, deep plowing, sufficient fertilizer, and uniform seeds have all been achieved, and the planting quality is good.

The broad masses of cadres and commune members of Hongshan Commune enthusiastically responded to the Party Central Committee's call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, and resolved to fire the first shot in next year's summer harvest. As early as late July, they fully launched preparations for autumn planting, and after two months, reclaimed more than 43,000 mu of new wasteland, and promptly prepared the soil once, ensuring that most of it was deeply plowed to a depth of seven inches or more. At the same time, they used weeds from the wasteland to smoke fertilizer on the spot, and turned it under as base fertilizer. They also specifically prepared 3.18 million dan of plant ash and fire-soil fertilizer to use as seed fertilizer to cover the seeds. Other plowing cattle, tools, and seeds were prepared earlier and more fully than in previous years.

In order to plant peas well, cadres at all levels of the commune have created high-quality, high-standard experimental plots. Before sowing, the entire commune also trained 3,400 skilled sowers, who are all able to sow seeds evenly and efficiently, sowing seeds with one hand and applying seed fertilizer with the other. Once sowing began, layer-by-layer sowing quality inspection and acceptance teams were established to check the sowing quality at any time. During the sowing process, they also promoted inherent experiences and new technologies. For example, there was not much intercropping in the past, but this year most of the planting is mixed with beans and wheat, ensuring rational close planting and preventing missing seedlings and broken ridges. Due to sufficient preparations and rational organization of labor, the commune's pea sowing task was completed ten days earlier than in the past.

    挖掘土地潜力多种早熟作物
    安岳县突击播种大麦豌豆移栽油菜严格讲求质量
    红山公社提前十天种完豌豆比去年扩大面积八倍
    本报讯　据四川日报消息：四川安岳县从10月1日以来，掀起了一个以播种大麦、“洋小麦”、菜豌豆和移栽油菜为中心的突击运动。
    为了确保明年小春粮食和油菜比以往任何一年都要多收一些，各人民公社一面扩大播种面积，一面严格讲求播种质量。他们采取检查、评比、验收等措施，保证使最近几年来在播种中行之有效的深耕早炕、施足底肥、合理密植、选用良种等增产措施，在小春作物播种中得到贯彻实施。在播种前，各公社对各种作物的种子都进行了科学处理；“洋小麦”都将做到宽幅条播密植；同时按规格质量要求，把每一亩油菜的株数栽够。为了使豌、胡豆由低产变高产，各公社也坚持做到了深耕细整土地和施足底肥。
    在突击运动中，全县机关干部、厂矿职工、学校师生和城镇居民，也都尽量抽出时间投入了这一战斗。10月1日以来，全县机关干部中，每天大约有80％的人员战斗在农业第一线上，和广大社员一道，突击播种小春作物。
    本报讯　据湖北日报消息：湖北省英山县红山人民公社四万亩豌豆，已经提前完成任务，比去年豌豆播种面积扩大了八倍多。经过层层检查验收，都做到了窄厢、深翻、肥足、籽匀，播种质量良好。
    红山公社广大干部社员，热烈响应党中央大办农业、大办粮食的号召，决心打响明年夏收头一炮。早在7月下旬，就全面展开秋种准备工作，经过两个月的时间，开垦了四万三千多亩新荒地，并及时炕土整地一次，大部分保证了深翻七寸以上。同时利用荒地杂草就地熏肥，翻压在下层做底肥。又专门准备了三百一十八万担草木灰、火土粪做种肥盖籽。其它耕牛、工具、种子比往年准备得早、准备得充分。
    为了把豌豆种好，公社各级干部都层层作了高质量高标准的试验田。在播种以前，全公社还训练了三千四百名播种能手，这些能手都能做到播子均匀，而且工效高，一手播子，一手下种肥。播种一开始，又层层建立了播种质量检查验收组，随时检查播种质量。在播种过程中，还发扬了固有的经验和推广了新技术。如以前混种的不多，今年大部分都是豆麦混种，保证了合理密植，防止了缺苗断垅。由于准备工作充分，合理组织了劳力，全社豌豆播种任务比过去提前十天完成。
