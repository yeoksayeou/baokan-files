    What They Did for Steel
    In the upsurge of the increase production and practice economy campaign, the steel workers of Shanghai were racing against time day and night in front of the furnaces, fighting for steel. The staff and workers of all trades and industries serving the steel plants were in high spirits, pooling their wisdom and efforts to support the increase in steel production in every possible way. People were all considering the question: "What can I do for steel?"
      Visiting to Rush Manufacture Machinery
    The several steel plants standing on both sides of the Huangpu River have been even busier these days. Among the crowds coming and going, you can see some people holding visitor slips, heading towards the steel furnace with the steelworkers.
    Who are these people? It turns out that in order to support the steel plants in achieving a large increase in production in the last few months of this year, the machinery factories in Shanghai have sent many workers and cadres to go deep into the steel plants, assist in solving equipment problems, and pave the way for increased production.
    Not long ago, four such guests came to the raw material yard of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, where pig iron was piled. They were all staff and workers from Shanghai People's Machinery Factory. Recently, they heard that some steel plants needed a batch of scrap iron crushers. Although they had not produced this product in the past, when the higher authorities assigned this manufacturing task to them, everyone felt extremely honored to be able to contribute to steel. In order to complete this task well, early this morning, two section chiefs from the technology section and veteran worker Fang Wenzheng and three others rushed to Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 from afar.
    The four people took a careful look at the raw material yard and asked the people who accompanied them for a tour, and they had a good understanding in their hearts. The steel plant wanted a scrap iron crusher not for anything else. It turned out that: the pig iron furnace workers recently adopted a new technology that requires the pig iron to be broken into small pieces before entering the furnace, which can greatly increase the output of molten iron and ensure the need for increased steel production. Knowing the use of the scrap iron crusher, they felt that the completion of this task was of great importance.
    The few people returned to the factory and immediately started working. On the one hand, they sent people to fraternal factories to exchange experiences, and on the other hand, they formed a shock design team to rush to design drawings. While designing, they discussed and tried every means to make this machine designed to meet the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. Someone originally planned to use compressed air to drive the hammer to knock the iron, so the steel plant would have to add equipment. When they inspected at the steel plant, they found that there were power plugs on many utility poles in the raw material yard, so they changed the compressed air transmission to electric transmission. After three days of hard work, a set of original three-wheeled mobile scrap iron crusher drawings came out in a rush. The production section immediately took over to seize the rush production, and all the collaborative parts processed by outside factories were properly arranged. One hundred and eight parts, wherever they went to any machine tool, the machine tool opened the green light for them, and they were unimpeded everywhere. The speed was faster than any product the factory had ever made in the past.
      Long-distance and Short-distance Accelerated Transportation
    Since late August, the railway stations near several steel plants have been particularly busy. Trains transported various ores, limestone, and coke directly from the producing areas to here. This non-stop direct express train is the "Red Dragon Express Train" organized by the Shanghai Railway Bureau to support the increase in steel production. Its quantitative, punctual, and fixed-line, rapid transportation has greatly shortened the distance between Shanghai, the steel industrial base, and the raw material bases of East China provinces.
    While accelerating the speed of transportation, the staff and workers of the railway bureau also actively and proactively expanded the source of raw materials for the steel plants. Not long ago, Zhou Che, director of the Freight Department of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, went to Longtan, Jiangsu, the origin of limestone, to understand the situation. The units mining limestone here lacked some materials such as machine gasoline, which affected the growth of production. Zhou Che consulted with relevant departments to find ways to help them solve these problems. The limestone shipped from Longtan Station soon increased.
    While the major transportation arteries such as railways and sea transportation are beating more actively, the small blood vessels of short-distance transportation are not lagging behind. The national advanced collective—the 104th motorcade of the Shanghai First Transportation Bureau, launched a new upsurge of competition to catch up with each other. When a vanguard team of this motorcade challenged each team, the target was 450 tons of output per shift. Recently, it has often exceeded this number, and sometimes it is as high as 900 tons or more. Transport workers not only compete to see who transports faster, but also who pays more attention to saving. Recently, a kind of iron dustpan appeared at Zhanghuabang Station. This is the creation of the workers on a single vehicle numbered 13036. They felt that in the past, when loading and unloading pig iron, some small pieces of iron would leak through the large nets, which was a waste. The workers said: "Although the iron is small, accumulation makes it a treasure." They used their spare time to successfully develop this kind of iron dustpan without mesh, and no scrap iron was wasted at all.
      Quartermaster Delivering Goods to the Door
    "Comrade, you know, if a car in a steel plant cannot be driven, how many raw materials will be transported less in a day! ..." In the office of Shanghai Baochang Automobile Material Factory, a female comrade spoke with a sincere and anxious tone, talking to a cadre of Baochang Factory. She is a staff member of Shanghai Transportation Equipment Store, and her name is Zhu Huiying.
    A few days ago, when she went to the factory, she learned that a steel plant had a Liberation brand car with several standard pistons broken and parked there unused. She rushed back to the store and saw that this kind of piston was just out of stock. She thought of Baochang Automobile Material Factory, which specializes in manufacturing pistons, and rushed to ask the factory for help. When the staff and workers of Baochang Factory heard that the steel plant needed pistons, they readily agreed and organized forces to rush to manufacture. When making pistons, Zhu Huiying stood in the workshop to help the factory inspect. As soon as all the pistons were made, she immediately sent them to the steel plant.
    This is just one example of Zhu Huiying's efforts to meet the needs of the steel plant in every possible way. After the Party Central Committee issued the call to carry out the increase production and practice economy campaign, she often said to people: In these days of fighting for steel, we business personnel should better play the role of a link and serve the steel plant more thoughtfully. As long as she learns where there is a need for automobile accessories, she keeps it in her mind day and night, and she is relieved only when she finds a way to solve it. Once, a car in Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 needed two "oil seals" with very special specifications, and the store was temporarily out of stock. On her way back to the store from the warehouse, she suddenly thought: "Units that may have this kind of car may have this kind of spare parts." She immediately visited three units that had this kind of car in a row, but there were no such spare parts. She was not discouraged at all and continued to visit. Finally, she ran to Shanghai Tram No. 2 Factory, where there happened to be four new "oil seals." She discussed with the comrades of the tram factory, got two "oil seals", and quickly took a ferry across the Huangpu River and sent them to Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3.
    In order to supply the materials needed for steel plant production quickly and well, many stores in Shanghai have established special work groups to go deep into the steel plants to provide door-to-door service. The Transportation Electrical Equipment Purchasing and Supply Station transferred more than 30 skilled staff and workers to form several visiting teams, divided into five routes, and visited more than a dozen steelmaking units in a few days. From late August to early September, in more than half a month, this station supplied nearly 200,000 pieces of goods to various steel plants, with a value of about one million yuan.
      Everyone Does Their Best to Make Contributions to Steel
    The slogan of supporting the increase in steel production has moved the hearts of countless people. Almost all industries are actively taking action under this lofty goal.
    Look! Several famous restaurants on Nanjing Road, such as Wuweizhai and Dasanyuan, have sent chefs to the steel plants to help the factory canteens improve their food. The chef of Ronghualou helped the canteen of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 10 add more than a dozen delicious and palatable new-style dishes in two days. The food and grocery industry in Huangpu District has been linked with several steel plants, and uses the method of follow-up service, with peddlers going down to the workshop to supply various foods. Some barber shops in Putuo District also often send barbers to Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and No. 8 to give haircuts to workers. The clock and watch industry and the eyeglasses industry in Wusong District send special personnel to the steel plants to repair the stopwatches used to calculate steelmaking time and the protective glasses worn by workers. These are all warmly welcomed by the staff and workers of the steel plants.
    Under the common goal of increasing steel production, people are really considering the steel plant with meticulous care. The staff and workers of the Municipal Telephone Bureau recently conducted a comprehensive test and repair of the telephones of users related to steel production. The Sichuan Road Telephone Branch dispatched 130 staff and workers to Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 to conduct a call quality test, eliminating the problems of "low sound" and "crosstalk" in the call. The postal and telecommunications departments extended the business hours of the post offices and postal stations near the steel plants. When the steel plants pay wages and hold meetings, they also go down to the factory to collect and send remittances and parcels, trying to save the steel workers' time and make it convenient for the steel workers.
    The battle to increase steel production has also inspired the medical staff of the city. The hospitals that were originally linked with various steel plants have sent doctors and nurses to the steel plants since August to serve the health of the workers. Renji Hospital, which is linked with Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, sent more than 20 doctors, nurses, and laboratory technicians to the factory to prevent and treat occupational diseases. Electrical ophthalmia among workers has now been basically eliminated. The working group of the First Affiliated Hospital of Shanghai First Medical College also used Sundays to clean up the workers' dormitories to allow the workers to rest better.
    The dedication of all walks of life to serve steel has added greater enthusiasm to the steel workers. With the support of all directions and unity of the people, Shanghai steel workers will win more outstanding and comprehensive leap-forward harvest fruits.

    他们为钢做了些什么
    在增产节约运动高潮中，上海市的钢铁工人日夜在炉前争分夺秒，为钢而战；为钢铁厂服务的各行各业的职工，则意气风发，群策群力，千方百计支援钢铁增产。人们都在考虑这样一个问题：“我能为钢做些什么？”
      登门造访赶制机械
    矗立在黄浦江两岸的几座钢铁厂里，这些日子显得更加繁忙。在来来往往的人群当中，你可以看到有些人手里拿着会客单，同炼钢工人一起走向炼钢炉边。
    这都是些什么人呢？原来，上海的机械工厂为了支援钢铁厂在今年最后几个月实现大增产，派出了许多工人和干部，深入到钢厂，协助解决设备方面的问题，为增产开路搭桥。
    前不久，上钢一厂堆放生铁的料场上，就来了四位这样的客人。他们都是上海人民机器厂的职工。最近，他们听说有些钢厂需要一批碎铁机，虽然过去他们没有生产过这种产品，但当上级把这个制造任务交给他们的时候，大家都以能为钢出力感到无上光荣。为了很好地完成这项任务，这天一清早，技术科的两位科长和老工人方文正等四个人，就老远赶到了上钢一厂。
    四个人在料场仔细一看，又问了一下陪他们参观的人，心里就有了个底。钢铁厂要碎铁机，不是为了别的。原来是：化铁炉工人最近采用了一项新技术，要求进炉以前的生铁先敲成小块，这样能大大提高铁水产量，保证增产钢的需要。知道了碎铁机的用途，越感到完成这项任务关系重大。
    几个人回到厂里就马上动手，一方面派人到兄弟厂交流经验，一方面组成一个突击设计小组，赶紧设计图纸。他们一边设计，一边商量，千方百计地想办法使这种机器设计得符合多快好省的要求。有人本来打算用压缩空气带动锤子敲铁，这样钢厂就要增加设备；他们在钢厂察看时，发现料场的许多电线杆上有电源插头，于是把压缩空气传动改为电力传动。经过三天的奋战，一套独创的三轮流动碎铁机的图纸突击出来了。生产科立即接上来抓紧赶制，外厂加工的协作件也全部作了妥善安排。一百零八个零件，一到哪台机床哪台机床就为它们开绿灯，到处通行无阻。进度之快，是这个厂过去制造任何产品所没有过的。
      长途短途加速运输
    从8月下旬开始，几个钢厂附近的火车站，显得格外繁忙。一列列火车，把各种矿石、石灰石、焦炭，从产地直接运到这里。这种中途不停的直达快车，是上海铁路局为支援钢铁增产而组织的“红龙快速列车”。它的定量、定时、定线，快速运输，使上海这个钢铁工业基地同华东各省原料基地之间的距离大大缩短。
    铁路局的职工在加快运输速度的同时，还积极主动地为钢铁厂扩大原料来源。不久以前，上海铁路局货运处处长周彻就曾到石灰石产地——江苏龙潭了解情况。这里采挖石灰石的单位缺少一部分机用汽油等材料，影响产量增长。周彻就同有关部门研究，设法帮助他们解决了这些问题。龙潭车站发运的石灰石，很快就增加了。
    铁路、海运等运输大动脉跳动得更加活跃，短途运输的小血管也不甘落后。全国先进集体——上海市第一交通局运输一场104车队，就掀起了你追我赶的竞赛新高潮。这个车队有一个尖兵小队，向各小队挑战时提出的指标是班产四百五十吨，最近以来经常超过这个数字，有时还高达九百吨以上。运输工人不但比谁运得快，还比谁更注意节约。在张华浜车站上，最近出现了一种铁畚斗。这是13036号单车上工人们的创造。他们感到过去在装卸生铁时，有些小块铁会穿过大网兜漏出来，是一种浪费。工人们说：“铁虽少，积少成多就是宝。”他们利用业余时间，研究成功了这种没有网眼的铁畚斗，碎铁就一点也不浪费了。
      后勤兵送货上门
    “同志，你知道，钢铁厂里有一部汽车开不动，一天要少运多少原料啊！……”在上海宝锠汽车材料厂的办公室里，一位女同志带着又诚恳又焦急的口气，在和宝锠厂的一个干部谈话。她是上海交通器材商店的工作人员，名字叫祝惠英。
    前几天，她在下厂时，了解到一个钢厂有一辆解放牌汽车坏了几个标准活塞，停在那里没有用。她赶回店里一看，这种活塞刚好缺货。她想起了专门制造活塞的宝锠汽车材料厂，就赶来请工厂帮忙。宝锠厂职工一听是钢厂要活塞，便一口答应，组织力量突击制造。造活塞时，祝惠英便站在车间里，帮助工厂检验。一等活塞全部做好，她就马上送到钢厂。
    这不过是祝惠英千方百计满足钢厂需要的一个事例。党中央发出开展增产节约运动的号召以后，她常对人说：在这为钢而战的日子里，我们商业人员应该更好地发挥纽带作用，为钢厂服务得更周到。她只要了解到哪里需要什么汽车配件，就日夜挂在心上，一定想办法解决了才放心。有一次，上钢三厂一辆汽车需要两个“油封”，规格很特殊，店里一时没有货。她在从仓库回商店的路上，忽然想起：“可能有这种汽车的单位会有这种备品。”她马上一连访问了三个有这种汽车的单位，但也没有这种备品。她一点也不灰心，又继续访问，最后跑到上海电车二场，恰好这里还有四个新的“油封”。她和电车场的同志商量，拿到了两个“油封”，连忙摆渡过黄浦江，送到了上钢三厂。
    为了把钢厂生产需用的物资供应得既快又好，上海许多商店都成立了专门工作组，深入钢厂上门服务。交通电工器材采购供应站就抽调了三十多个业务熟练的职工，组成几个访问队，分成五路，在短短几天内，访问了十多个炼钢单位。从8月下旬到9月初的半个多月内，这个站便供应给各钢厂近二十万件商品，价值在一百万元左右。
      各尽所能为钢立功
    支援钢铁增产的口号，激动着无数人的心。几乎是所有行业的人都在这一崇高的目标下积极行动起来了。
    看！南京路上五味斋、大三元等几家著名的饮食店，都派了厨师到钢铁厂去帮助工厂食堂搞好伙食。荣华楼的厨师在两天之内，就帮助上钢十厂的食堂增加了十多种美味可口的新花式菜肴。黄浦区食品杂货业已经和几个钢铁厂挂上钩，用跟班服务的方法，挑货郎担下车间供应各种食品。普陀区的一些理发店，也经常派理发师到上钢一厂、八厂，去为工人理发。吴淞区的钟表业、眼镜业，派专人到钢厂去修理计算炼钢时间用的马表和工人戴的防护眼镜。这都受到钢铁厂职工的热烈欢迎。
    在为了增产钢铁的共同目标下，人们为钢厂考虑得真是无微不至。市内电话局职工最近把同钢铁生产有关的用户的电话，作了一次全面的测试检修。四川路电话分局出动了一百三十名职工，到上钢一厂进行通话质量试验，消除了通话中“声低”和“串音”的毛病。邮电部门则把钢厂附近的邮电局邮电所的营业时间延长；在钢厂发工资和开大会时，还下厂收寄汇款、包裹，尽量节省钢铁工人的时间，为钢铁工人谋方便。
    增产钢的战斗，同样鼓舞了全市的医务人员。原来和各钢厂挂钩的医院，8月份以来，更纷纷派医师、护士深入钢厂，为工人健康服务。同上钢一厂挂钩的仁济医院，二十多个医生、护士、化验员下厂防治职业病，工人中的电光性眼炎现在已经基本消灭。上海第一医学院附属第一医院组成的工作组还利用星期日，为工人清扫宿舍，让工人休息得更好。
    各行各业各尽所能、为钢服务的心意，使钢铁工人增添了更大的干劲。在这四面八方、万众一心的支援下，上海钢铁工人将会赢得更出色的全面跃进的丰收果实。
