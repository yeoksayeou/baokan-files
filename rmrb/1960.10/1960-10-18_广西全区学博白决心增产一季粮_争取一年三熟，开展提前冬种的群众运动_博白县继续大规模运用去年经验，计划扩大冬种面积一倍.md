This newspaper Nanning, October 17th: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is actively promoting Bobai County's experience of three crops a year and engaging in large-scale winter planting, determined to increase grain production by another season. This is an important measure to adapt to the new situation of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production this winter. To achieve this measure, the entire region is planning to advance winter planting and universally carry out the "active winter, dry autumn" movement, striving to plant a batch of overwintering crops before the autumn harvest. As of the 10th, the entire autonomous region has planted more than 1,725,000 mu of overwintering crops.

Advancing winter planting has many benefits. First, it can resolve the contradiction between the unprecedented expansion of winter planting area and the tight season and insufficient labor. This year, the planned winter planting area in the entire autonomous region exceeds any previous year, with the planting area of ​​grain crops alone equivalent to that of one rice crop. This year's autumn harvest crops have also expanded a lot compared to previous years, with the double-cropping late rice, which has a strong harvest seasonality, also expanding by more than 1 million mu compared to last year. In this way, the entire workload of autumn harvest and winter planting has increased unprecedentedly. Overwintering crops generally have a shorter growing period and strong seasonality, requiring timely sowing. Planting some winter crops before the autumn harvest can reduce the workload after the autumn harvest, and labor can be used with ease. Second, early planting and early harvest, everything is early, which is convenient for arranging the stubble for spring planting next year, and can also harvest some grain and feed earlier next spring, striving for the initiative in the overall work. Third, carrying out winter planting in stages and batches can also avoid rough cultivation caused by work being squeezed together, thereby improving the quality of cultivation and achieving not only three crops but also high yields.

Experience in various parts of Guangxi has proven that advancing winter planting is entirely possible. Winter crops have varying growth periods, varying temperature requirements, and varying varieties of early and late maturity, which creates the possibility of sowing in stages and batches. Moreover, some winter crops can increase production by sowing earlier. For example, wheat is a crop with strict requirements for external climate. The temperature in Guangxi after October is basically suitable for wheat sowing. Other sweet potatoes, buckwheat, potatoes, broad beans, and peas have greater adaptability to temperature and can be sown earlier. Last year, the Liang'an Brigade of the Niumiao Commune in Fuzhong County planted wheat in the ninth month of the lunar calendar, which had a yield per mu that was more than 40% higher than wheat with the same conditions planted in the tenth month of the lunar calendar. The Shahe Brigade of the Shahe Commune in Bobai County planted winter sweet potatoes after the Frost's Descent, with a yield of 2,200 jin per mu, while those planted after the Beginning of Winter only yielded more than 700 jin per mu. After full discussions and summing up of past experiences in various places, recognizing the significance and possibility of "active winter, dry autumn," they immediately started working, doing what they said they would do, and a wave of early winter planting appeared in both southern and northern Guangxi.

In the utilization of land for planned early winter planting, it is necessary to consider the situation of the previous crop, looking ahead and behind, and arranging tightly. Before advancing winter planting, various places universally organized commune members to conduct field surveys and line up land and crops in order to harvest and plant in a timely manner. The winter planting work in the entire autonomous region will be carried out in three campaigns: 1. Currently, mid-season rice, summer sweet potatoes, peanuts, late corn, soybeans, sesame, etc., are being harvested or are about to mature and be harvested. It is necessary to seize the time to harvest and plant quickly, and plant a batch of winter crops first; 2. During the busy season of late rice harvesting, winter planting should be carried out while harvesting autumn crops, requiring the basic completion of winter planting tasks; 3. After the Beginning of Winter and before the Light Snow, the final finishing touches should be completed, and all winter planting should be concluded. According to this spirit, various places have adopted active measures to tap the potential of the land and strive to plant more before autumn. For example, the Huangsha Brigade of the Chaodong Commune in Fuzhong County used to wait until the stalks of sorghum and soybeans withered before harvesting them, and peanuts were even harvested at the end of the year or the beginning of the year. This year, in order to advance winter planting, they adopted the method of harvesting as soon as they ripened, vacating the land, plowing and planting while harvesting, and completing the winter planting task of 3,050 mu in one go, exceeding the quota. Various places have also vigorously engaged in intercropping and relay cropping. Of the 640,000 mu of winter crops already planted in the Guilin area, 80% are intercropped or relay cropped. Quanzhou County, mainly with buckwheat, intercrops and relay crops barley, wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, peas, etc., making use of every inch of land, using one piece of land for multiple purposes, and has completed more than 320,000 mu of winter planting. In addition, various places have also made full use of scattered land and appropriately reclaimed wasteland to tap the potential of the land. For example, the Jiafu Brigade of the Daning Commune in He County, in addition to intercropping and relay cropping, made full use of scattered land on the sides of mountains, roads, houses, and ponds, and completed half of the winter planting task before autumn in four days. Chengxiang Commune in Pingnan County has less land and has expanded winter crops by 4,000 mu by reclaiming wasteland, accounting for 40% of the area of ​​winter crops already planted.

In order to adapt to the needs of advancing winter planting, in addition to further strengthening the labor force in field production, corresponding adjustments have also been made to labor organization and management. For example, the Jiafu Brigade of the Daning Commune in He County divided the labor force into three groups: one group continued to strengthen field management of late rice, one group accumulated winter planting fertilizer, and one group devoted all its efforts to land preparation and planting. Therefore, the entire team not only quickly completed half of the winter planting plan before autumn, but also did not let up on the management of late rice, and the 144 mu of third-class seedlings were universally upgraded. Some areas combine autumn field management and pre-autumn winter planting, assigning tasks to work groups and proceeding simultaneously. For example, the Shatou Commune in Cangwu County implements a three-combination approach: harvesting dry land crops combined with winter planting, accumulating fertilizer for late rice combined with accumulating fertilizer for winter planting, topdressing fertilizer for late rice in the morning, and engaging in winter planting in the afternoon. Tasks are assigned to groups and quotas are assigned to individuals. The entire commune has completed one-third of the winter sweet potato planting task.

This newspaper Nanning, October 17th: Bobai County in Guangxi is using last year's experience to propose the requirements of both expanding the multiple cropping index and achieving high yields in this year's winter planting. A winter planting program on an even larger scale than last winter has already begun.

Bobai County began to reform the cropping system from last year's winter planting. After harvesting early rice and late rice, it increased one crop of winter planting, changing from two crops a year to three crops a year, opening up a reliable way to rapidly increase grain production. According to last year's experience, the key to achieving three crops lies in winter planting. This year, the county plans to expand the winter planting area by more than double that of last year. In order to achieve victory in large-scale winter planting, the county party committee and commune party committee conducted in-depth mobilization work, so that the basic experience of last year was systematically grasped by the masses, and large-scale winter planting became a conscious action of the entire party and the entire people. Under the ideological guidance of vigorously developing winter planting and striving for high yields, winter planting plans were quickly implemented to teams and fields. The county planned that grain crops such as wheat, barley, sweet potatoes, and potatoes would account for 80% of the winter planting area, and vegetables, oil crops, feed, and green manure would account for 20%.

Bobai County, starting from the overall situation of three crops a year, and in line with the principle that the previous crop is for the next crop, the autumn harvest is for winter planting, and winter planting is for next year, rationally arranged the stubble. Now, all communes, brigades, and teams in the county have made specific plans for winter planting based on the time of maturity of late rice in their respective communes and teams, and based on the varieties and soil quality of winter crops, so that winter planting arrangements are mutually adapted and connected with the early crop planting plan for next year. The May 1st Brigade of the Longtan Commune planted 1,000 mu of early-maturing fine varieties such as Dagu for late rice this year, arranging for early harvesting and early planting of winter sweet potatoes with a longer growing period; 1,000 mu of mid-maturing varieties of late rice such as "Tangfu Dwarf" are arranged for later harvesting and planting of wheat with a moderately long growing period; and the remaining 2,000 mu of late-maturing varieties such as "Baotaihong" are arranged for final harvesting and planting of winter beans and vegetables with a shorter growing period. This arrangement not only rationally regulates the use of labor, but also ensures that various winter crops have sufficient growth time, which can increase yields and does not affect early rice transplanting next year. In terms of planting crop types, all communes adhere to the principle of adapting to local conditions and implementing rational planting. The southeastern part of the county has a higher temperature, so it plants more sweet potatoes; the northern part and the riverbank have a lower temperature, so it plants more barley and wheat; vegetables and winter beans are planted everywhere, and intercropping and relay cropping are vigorously carried out to improve land utilization.

In order to strive for high yields, all communes, while earnestly doing a good job in comprehensive preparation, focus on grasping two key measures: promoting early-maturing and high-yielding fine varieties and accumulating sufficient high-quality fertilizer. The county has prepared more than 6 million jin of fine winter planting varieties, enough for all winter planting needs. As of the end of September, the county has accumulated a large amount of fertilizer, with an average of 44 dan of fertilizer per mu of winter planting, of which nearly half is concentrated fertilizer.

Now, the prelude to large-scale winter planting in the county has begun. According to statistics from the three communes of Chengxiang, Songshan, and Longtan, as of the 6th, more than 33,000 mu of winter crops have been planted. (Attached picture)

    广西全区学博白决心增产一季粮
    争取一年三熟，开展提前冬种的群众运动
    博白县继续大规模运用去年经验，计划扩大冬种面积一倍
    本报南宁17日电　广西僮族自治区积极推广博白县一年三熟的经验，大搞冬种，决心再增产一季粮食。这是适应今冬大办农业、大办粮食的新形势的一项重要措施。为了实现这个措施，全区有计划地提早冬种，普遍开展“冬活秋干”运动，力争在秋收前种下一批越冬作物。到10日止，全自治区已种下越冬作物一百七十二万五千多亩。
    提前冬种好处很多。首先，它可以解决冬种面积空前扩大与季节紧、劳动力不足的矛盾。全自治区今年计划冬种面积，超过了以往任何一年，其中粮食作物种植面积就相当于一造水稻的种植面积。而今年的秋收作物也比往年扩大很多，其中收获季节性强的双季晚稻，也比去年扩大一百多万亩。这样，秋收冬种的整个工作量就空前增大。而越冬作物的生长期一般较短，季节性也强，要求及时播种。把部分冬种提早在秋收之前种下，就能够减轻秋后工作量，劳动力可以从容地使用。其次，早种早收，一早百早，既便于安排明年春种茬口，又能在明春提早收获一部分粮食和饲料，争取全盘工作的主动。第三，分期分批进行冬种，还可以避免由于工作挤在一起而造成的耕作粗放，从而提高耕种质量，做到不仅三熟，而且高产。
    广西各地经验证明，提早冬种，完全可能。冬种作物生长期有长有短，需要的气温有高有低，品种有早熟迟熟，这就存在分期分批播种的可能性。而且有些冬种作物提早播种还能增产。例如小麦，是对外界气候要求较严格的一项作物。而广西10月份以后的气温，基本上都是适宜于小麦播种的。其他红薯、荞麦、土豆、蚕豌豆等，对温度的适应性较大，就更可以提早播种。去年富钟县牛庙公社两安大队，在农历九月播种的小麦，比农历十月播种的其他条件都相同的小麦，亩产高四成以上。博白县沙河公社沙河大队，霜降种下的冬红薯，亩产达二千二百斤，而立冬后种的亩产只七百多斤。各地经过充分讨论，并总结了往年的经验，认识了冬活秋干的意义和可能之后，便立即动手，说干就干，桂南桂北都出现了提前冬种的热潮。
    有计划地提早冬种，在土地的利用上，必须根据前茬作物的情况，瞻前顾后，紧凑安排。各地在提早冬种前，普遍组织了社员临田勘查，进行土地、作物排队，以便适时收种。全自治区的冬种工作，将分为三个战役进行：一、目前，中稻、夏红薯、花生、晚玉米、黄豆、芝麻等正在收割或即将成熟收割，必须适时抢收抢种，先种上一批冬种作物；二、晚稻收割大忙时，边秋收边冬种，要求基本完成冬种任务；三、立冬以后，小雪之前，最后扫尾，全部结束冬种。据此精神，各地采取了积极措施，挖掘土地潜力，力争秋前多种。如富钟县朝东公社黄沙大队，往年高粱黄豆熟后，要等到秆子枯死才收，大花生甚至等到年底或开年才收。今年为了提早冬种，采取即熟即收，腾出土地，边收边犁边种，一鼓作气，超额完成了三千零五十亩的冬种任务。各地还大搞间种套种。桂林专区已种下的六十四万亩冬种作物，80％是间种套种的。全州县以荞麦为主，间种、套种大麦、小麦、油菜、蚕豆、豌豆等，见缝插针，一地几用，已完成冬种三十二万多亩。此外，各地还充分利用零星土地，适当开荒，大挖土地潜力。如贺县大宁公社加福大队，除间种套种外，充分利用山边、路边、屋边、塘边的零散土地，四天便完成了秋前冬种任务的一半。平南县城厢公社土地较少，开荒扩种了冬作物四千亩，占已种冬种作物面积的40％。
    为了适应提早冬种的需要，各地除进一步加强田间生产的劳动力外，对劳动组织和管理，也作了相应的调整。如贺县大宁公社加福大队把劳动力分成三套：一套继续加强晚稻田间管理；一套积造冬种肥料；一套全力整地抢种。因此，全队不仅很快完成了秋前冬种计划的一半，而且晚稻管理也一步不让，一百四十四亩三类禾普遍升级。有的地区则把秋田管理和秋前冬种结合在一起，把任务包到作业组，同时并进。如苍梧县沙头公社实行三结合：收旱地作物结合冬种，积晚稻用肥结合积造冬种肥料，上午追晚稻禾胎肥，下午搞冬种，任务分到组，定额包到人，全社完成了冬种红薯任务的三分之一。
    本报南宁17日电　广西博白县运用去年的经验，在今年冬种中提出既要扩大复种指数，又要高产的要求，一个比去冬更大规模的冬种序幕已经揭开。
    博白县从去年冬种开始改革耕作制度，在收获早稻、晚稻之后，又增种了一造冬种，由一年两熟变为一年三熟，为迅速增产粮食开辟了一条可靠途径。根据去年的经验，实现三熟关键在于冬种。这个县今年计划冬种面积比去年扩大一倍多。为了取得大规模冬种的胜利，县委及公社党委深入地进行了动员工作，使去年的基本经验，系统地为群众所掌握，大搞冬种变成了全党全民的自觉行动。全县在大搞冬种和力争高产的思想指导下，冬种规划迅速落实到队、到田，全县规划小麦、大麦、红薯、土豆等粮食作物占冬种面积的80％，蔬菜、油料、饲料、绿肥等占20％。
    博白县从一年三熟的全局出发，本着上造为下造，秋收为冬种，冬种为明年的原则，合理安排了茬口。现在全县各公社、大队、小队根据本社、本队晚稻成熟迟早的情况，根据冬种作物品种和土质，作出了冬种的具体计划，使冬种安排与明年的早造种植计划互相适应，互相衔接。龙潭公社五一大队，今年晚稻种植大谷等早熟良种一千亩，安排先熟先割，先种生长期较长的冬红薯；晚稻中熟品种“塘甫矮”等一千亩，安排后割，种生长期次长的小麦；其余迟熟“包胎红”等品种二千多亩，则安排最后收割，种生长期较短的冬豆和蔬菜。这样安排，不仅劳动力使用得到合理调节，而且保证了各种冬作物都有足够生长时间，能够提高产量，还不影响明年早稻插秧。在种植作物种类上，各公社都本着因地制宜的原则，实行合理种植。县的东南部气温较高，就多种红薯；北部与河岸气温较低，就多种大、小麦；蔬菜、冬豆则随处都种，并大搞间种套种，提高土地利用率。
    为了力争高产，各公社在切切实实做好全面准备工作当中，突击抓好推广早熟高产良种和积足优质肥料两个关键性的措施。全县已准备冬种良种六百多万斤，足够全部冬种需要。全县到9月下旬已积下大批肥料，平均每亩冬种有肥四十四担，其中将近一半是精肥。
    现在，全县大搞冬种的序幕已经揭开，据城厢、松山、龙潭三个公社统计，到6日止，已种下冬作物三万三千多亩。（附图片）
