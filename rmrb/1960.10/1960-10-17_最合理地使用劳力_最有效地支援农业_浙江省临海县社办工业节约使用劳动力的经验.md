Editor's Note: In the movement of the whole Party and the whole people to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, industrial departments should actively save all labor that can be saved to support agricultural production. Commune-run industries should make more rational use of labor and save manpower to strengthen the front line of agricultural production. The experience of Linhai County in saving labor in commune-run industries is very good and worthy of reference by other places. As for the proportion of labor occupied by commune-run industries to the total labor force of the commune and the proportion of labor occupied by various types of enterprises in commune-run industries, it should be determined according to the specific conditions of each place. The general spirit should be: use the least labor to most effectively support agricultural production.

    The 228 factories run by the people's communes in Linhai County, Zhejiang Province, in the spirit of "most rational use of labor, most effective support for agriculture," have become increasingly economical in their use of labor through continuous consolidation, rectification, and improvement. In the past month or so, 9,240 laborers have been drawn out and replenished to the front line of agricultural production. Currently, the labor force occupied by commune-run industries in the county accounts for 2.76% of the total labor force of each commune.

    The use of labor is becoming more and more economical, but the work of serving agricultural production is getting better and better. Taking various agricultural implements produced by commune-run industries as an example: calculated by the number of pieces, the second half of 1959 increased by 15.3% compared with the first half of the year, and the first half of this year increased by 17.7 times compared with the second half of last year. In the first half of 1959, only simple farm tools such as sickles, plows, and harrows could be produced. This year, it has developed to be able to manufacture more than 100 kinds of agricultural implements such as rice transplanters, rice threshers, and feed crushers. Since the beginning of this year, the various communes have produced more than 2,200 tons of local fertilizer and local pesticides, more than six times the total amount produced last year. Commune-run industries have played an important role in promoting the development of agricultural production and accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture.

    **Using Steel Where it Counts**

    An important reason why commune-run industries in Linhai County are able to save labor and provide good support for agriculture is that the Party committees of the communes in the county have earnestly implemented the policy that commune-run industries should first serve agricultural production, "using steel where it counts," and concentrating their efforts on running factories that directly serve agricultural production well.

    The measures they have taken are: first, the use of labor in commune-run industries should first meet the needs of factories that directly serve agriculture; second, priority should be given to meeting the needs of these factories in terms of materials and financial resources; and third, strengthening the leading backbone of these factories and strengthening specific leadership over these factories. According to statistics from the four communes of Chengxi, Datian, Haiyou, and Shuanggang, there are 11 factories that directly serve agricultural production, such as machinery factories, farm tool factories, pesticide and fertilizer factories, bamboo ware factories, and wooden ware factories, which use 66.51% of the total labor force of commune-run industries; there are 9 units that partially serve agricultural production (such as agricultural and sideline product processing factories, ceramics factories, etc.), which use 16.5% of the labor force; the two together occupy 83.01% of the labor force; other enterprises that serve the lives of commune members, serve large-scale industry, and serve exports occupy 16.99% of the labor force. Among them, the proportion of labor used by factories in Haiyou Commune that directly serve agricultural production is even higher, reaching more than 90% of the labor force in commune-run industries.

    Due to the concentrated use of forces, the production of these factories serving agricultural production has developed rapidly. In 1959, they manufactured 1.18 million various agricultural implements, accounting for 59.1% of the required amount. By the end of August this year, they had produced 2.2 million various agricultural implements, accounting for 85.2% of the required amount. The large-scale use of new-style agricultural implements has improved the labor efficiency of agricultural production. According to calculations, the agricultural implements produced this year alone can save 6,804 agricultural laborers.

    **Organizing Peasants to Work in Slack Seasons**

    The county also resolutely assigns projects suitable for production teams to operate as sidelines to the production teams, and mobilizes peasants to engage in projects that can be done by peasants in their spare time through the development of the "skillful peasant" movement, so that many commune members engage in farming during the busy season and work in slack seasons, achieving both industry and agriculture, and being multi-skilled. This method of combining commune-run industries, team-run sidelines, and the "skillful peasant" movement can also save the permanent labor force occupied by commune-run industries.

    The commune-run industries and team-run sidelines of Chengxi, Datian, Haiyou, and other communes are divided and cooperate in this way: commune-run industries mainly trial-produce and produce some larger and newer agricultural implements, higher-grade pesticides and fertilizers, and establish factories that production teams cannot afford or are not suitable for team-run; farm tool repair, the manufacture of some small farm tools, and the production of local pesticides, local fertilizers, lace, fishing nets, and other production projects that production teams can operate are assigned to the production teams. There are three main advantages to doing this: first, the production teams can flexibly arrange labor according to the agricultural season and use the slack season and agricultural gaps to repair and manufacture farm tools and produce fertilizers and pesticides, which strengthens the force for manufacturing agricultural production materials and saves labor for commune-run industries, ensuring that more labor is invested in the front line of agricultural production during the busy agricultural season. A total of 2,500 commune members in the 77 production teams of Chengxi Commune used their agricultural spare time to repair and manufacture bamboo and wood farm tools. If the tasks they undertake were concentrated in commune-run factories, commune-run factories would have to add 625 people, more than the existing number of people in commune-run industries in this commune. Second, production teams can repair and manufacture agricultural production materials in accordance with local conditions and in accordance with the season, better "revolving around agricultural production and following the agricultural season," while also making full use of their own resources and reducing the cost of agricultural production materials. The various production teams in Chengxi Commune use the local abundant wild grass and trees to manufacture local pesticides and local fertilizers, which reduces the cost by half compared with centralized production by the commune. Third, after projects suitable for production teams to run are assigned to the production teams, commune-run industries can concentrate their efforts on running the main factories well and free up more forces to manufacture large-scale agricultural implements and study and improve agricultural implements.

    The commune's development of the "skillful peasant" movement and the production and repair of small farm tools have also played a not small role in saving labor for industry and meeting the needs of agricultural production. Chengxi Commune, where the "skillful peasant" movement has been developed better, has adopted methods such as teachers leading apprentices and on-site teaching to train more than 2,000 "skillful peasants"; more than 500 of them have mastered the complete set of techniques for repairing and manufacturing bamboo and wood farm tools, achieving both farming and working, both industry and agriculture. Commune members believe that the advantages of this approach are: it makes full use of the fragmented time of agricultural work such as morning, evening, and rainy days, and gives full play to the role of semi-labor and auxiliary labor, so it can free up strong labor to participate in field production and save the production team's expenses. The 150 "skillful peasants" in Yangtu Production Team of Chengxi Commune used their agricultural spare time to manufacture more than 3,500 pieces of bamboo mats, raincoats, etc., and repair more than 580 pieces of farm tools from January to July, equivalent to the workload of more than 1,800 working days for bamboo and wood workers, which not only supplied the needs of agricultural production in a timely manner, but also saved more than 1,000 yuan in the cost of adding and repairing small farm tools.

    **Technological Innovation Unleashes Potential**

    Carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution and vigorously improving labor productivity is an important link for commune-run industries in Linhai County to save labor.

    The commune-run factories in Linhai County generally started from scratch, and were almost all manual operations at the beginning. The backward manual operation contains huge labor potential. The commune-run factories in the four communes of Chengxi, Datian, Haiyou, and Shuanggang alone have increased 35 sets of machine equipment through vigorous technological innovation, and labor productivity has doubled, achieving one person doing the work of three.

    In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, commune-run industries in Linhai County focused on solving the power problem. This is because without power, there is no way to talk about mechanical production, and commune-run industries are distributed in the vast rural areas lacking power industry. Only by solving the power problem first can they leap from backward manual operations to the mechanicalization. Commune-run industries in the four communes of Chengxi, Datian, Haiyou, and Shuanggang have excavated a total of 444 horsepower of power resources, driving 234 machines, which has greatly improved labor efficiency. In the process of solving the power problem, they mainly grasped the following two principles: one is to adapt to local conditions and excavate whatever power resources there are. Chengxi Commune has many streams, so they moved the factories to the streams and made full use of the local abundant water resources. Datian Commune has many water pumps, so they tried to make comprehensive use of the water pumps; 32 water pumps drove 96 machines. Some communes also used wind power and tidal power as power. Another principle is to be simple and crude, start with local methods, and solve problems in materials, equipment, and technology by themselves. Chengxi Commune lacked water turbines, so the commune-run wooden ware factory and machinery factory made them themselves, producing a total of 31 sets, which met the needs. In order to solve the power problem, commune-run industries in Shuanggang and other communes produced local gas generators, local steam engines, and other equipment themselves.

    **"Management" Generates Labor**

    Commune-run industries in Linhai County also grasped the key of "management" and tapped labor potential. That is, with the development of production, they have continuously strengthened the operation and management of commune-run industries, improved labor organization, established and improved the responsibility system, and rationally used labor.

    Their specific methods are: first, make the labor organization adapt to the development of production. Especially with the in-depth development of technological innovation and technological revolution, the technical level and production efficiency have been improved, and the labor organization must be adapted to it. The two kilns of the refractory material factory in Chengguan Commune originally required three shifts of twelve people to watch the fire. Because of the technological innovation, the kiln firing time was shortened, and two shifts of eight people were enough. The factory adjusted the labor organization in a timely manner and saved one-third of the labor force.

    Second, establish and improve various production responsibility systems. After Datian Pottery Factory implemented quota management, production efficiency improved rapidly. The number of pottery blanks made by each person per day increased from 18 to 28, and the work efficiency increased by more than 50%. The number of products per kiln increased from the original 1,600 pieces to 2,037 pieces, and the rate of qualified products reached more than 95%.

    Third, according to the characteristics of the small scale of commune-run industries, reduce the proportion of non-production personnel to the maximum extent. According to the survey, the proportion of administrative management personnel separated from production to the total number of employees is 1.2% for commune-run industries in Chengxi Commune and 1.6% for commune-run industries in Datian Commune. Generally, factories with a small number of people do not have full-time administrative management personnel. Their main methods for reducing full-time management personnel are: mobilizing the workers to participate in management work such as statistics, storage, and cashier in their spare time; one person兼职数职, such as the factory director兼采购员,保管员, several factories jointly set up an accountant, etc.; some management cadres not only do part of the management work, but also often participate in labor, half separated from production or partially separated from production. The director of the Chengxi Commune Paper Mill兼采购员, the accountant兼管食堂,出纳, and mobilized the employees to engage in it in their spare time. As a result, the number of full-time management cadres was reduced by more than half, and some people were drawn out to strengthen the agricultural front line.

    **Enthusiasm – The Decisive Factor**

    The fundamental reason why commune-run industries in Linhai County can use fewer people to support agriculture well is that they adhere to putting politics in command and fully mobilize the workers' awareness of supporting agriculture and their enthusiasm for production.

    They have vigorously grasped political and ideological work and have often carried out education among the workers on the foundation of the national economy being agriculture, and education on striving to become stronger and running enterprises diligently and frugally. Every step in these ideological education works has greatly stimulated the workers' enthusiasm for labor and improved production efficiency. Recently, the communes have generally launched discussions on the topics of "Why agriculture is the foundation of the national economy" and "Industry must vigorously support agriculture." By presenting the facts and calculating the details, the workers have realized that agriculture and industry are in a "rising tide raises all boats" relationship. The faster agriculture develops, the faster factory production will leap forward. The workers have expressed that fewer people should be used, and agriculture should be supported well. Although 60 people from the farm tool factory in Shuanggang Commune supported the agricultural front line, the manufacturing task of 350 rice threshing machine wooden frames was still completed 16 days ahead of schedule, and production efficiency increased by 35.3%.

    The leading cadres of the commune-run factories in the county adhere to eating, living, working, and discussing with the workers, making the relationship between leaders and the masses closer. In Shuanggang Commune, from the commune's industrial secretary to the factory's Party branch secretary, the 24 factory directors spend an average of more than half of their time participating in labor. The workers said: "Picking up the hammer, our hearts are linked, exchanging sweat is even more intimate, the cadres and the masses are working together, supporting the agricultural Great Leap Forward." The deputy director of the Datian Machinery Factory took the lead in labor in the casting workshop and took the lead in innovation, which encouraged the workers' creative enthusiasm. The entire workshop completed 42 innovation projects, and labor efficiency increased by 2.1 times, saving 112 laborers.

    The commune-run factories often organize socialist labor competitions. The Party committees of these communes have taken the organization of labor competitions in commune-run industries and the development of the "one top several" movement as a regular work, and have continuously grasped inspections and comparisons to promote the competition to deepen step by step. The competition in each factory is centered on "who serves agriculture well," comparing quality, comparing quantity, and comparing catching up ahead of the season. After the machinery factory and the farm tool factory in Shuanggang Commune were linked in the competition, the finished product rate of large sickles increased from 92% to 100%. The original plan was to produce 3,000 pieces, but because the quality was good, the peasants competed to use them, and the workers' enthusiasm became greater and greater. As a result, more than 16,000 pieces were produced.

    最合理地使用劳力　最有效地支援农业
    ——浙江省临海县社办工业节约使用劳动力的经验
    中共临海县委通讯组　浙江日报记者　本报驻浙江记者
    编者按　在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的运动中，工业部门应该积极节约一切可以节约的劳动力，支援农业生产。社办工业更应该合理地使用劳动力，节约出人力加强农业生产第一线。临海县社办工业节约使用劳动力的经验很好，值得各地参考。至于社办工业劳动力占公社劳动力的比例和社办工业中各类企业占用劳动力的比例，则应根据各地具体情况而定。总的精神应该是：用最少的劳动力，最有效地支援农业生产。
    浙江省临海县各人民公社举办的二百二十八个工厂，本着“最合理地使用劳力，最有效地支援农业”的精神，经过不断地整顿、巩固、提高，使用的劳动力越来越节省。最近一个多月，就抽出九千二百四十个劳动力，充实了农业生产第一线。目前，全县社办工业占用的劳动力为各公社劳动力总数的2.76％。
    劳动力的使用越来越节省，为农业生产服务的工作却做得越来越好。以社办工业生产的各种农业机具为例：按件数计算，1959年下半年比上半年增加了15.3％，今年上半年又比去年下半年增加了十七点七倍。1959年上半年只能生产镰刀、犁、耙等简单农具，今年已发展到能制造插秧机、打稻机、饲料粉碎机等一百多种农业机具。今年以来，各公社生产的土化肥、土农药有二千二百多吨，比去年全年增加六倍多。社办工业对促进农业生产的发展和加速农业技术改造起了重要作用。
    把钢用在刀刃上
    临海县社办工业做到劳力用得省、支援农业好的重要原因，是这个县的各个公社党委切实贯彻了社办工业首先为农业生产服务的方针，“把钢用在刀刃上”，集中力量办好直接为农业生产服务的工厂。
    他们采取的措施是：第一，社办工业劳动力的使用，首先满足直接为农业服务的工厂的需要；第二，在物力、财力方面优先满足这些厂的需要；第三，加强这些厂的领导骨干，加强对这些工厂的具体领导。据城西、大田、海游、双港四个公社的统计，直接为农业生产服务的工厂有机械厂、农具厂、农药化肥厂、竹器厂、木器厂等十一个，使用的劳动力占社办工业总劳动力的66.51％；部分为农业生产服务的单位（如农副产品加工厂、陶瓷厂等）有九个，使用劳动力16.5％；两者合计占用劳动力83.01％；其他为社员生活服务、为大工业和出口服务的企业，占用劳动力16.99％。其中海游公社直接为农业生产服务的工厂使用的劳动力，在社办工业劳动力中所占的比重，更高达90％以上。
    由于集中使用力量，这些为农业生产服务的工厂生产发展很快。1959年，它们制造了各种农业机具一百一十八万件，占需要量的59.1％，今年到8月底生产的各种农业机具已有二百二十万件，占需要量的85.2％。新式农业机具的大量使用，提高了农业生产的劳动效率。据计算，仅今年生产的农业机具就可以节约农业劳动力六千八百零四个。
    组织农民农闲做工
    这个县还把适合生产队作副业的项目坚决划给生产队去办，把那些农民业余能搞的项目通过开展“巧农民”运动发动农民来搞，使许多社员农忙务农、农闲做工，作到亦工亦农，一人多艺。这种社办工业、队办副业、“巧农民”运动三结合的办法，也可以节省社办工业占用的常年劳动力。
    城西、大田、海游等公社的社办工业和队办副业，是这样分工协作的：社办工业主要是试制和生产一些较大的和新型的农业机具，较高级的农药化肥、兴办生产队力所不及或不宜队办的工厂；农具修理、部分小农具的制造，以及生产队可以经营的土农药、土化肥、花边、鱼网等生产项目，则划给生产队去办。这样做的好处主要有三：第一，生产队可以根据农事季节，灵活安排劳力，利用农闲和农事空隙时间修制农具，生产肥料、农药，既壮大了制造农业生产资料的力量，又能节省用于社办工业的劳动力，保证农忙季节有更多的劳动力投入农业生产第一线。城西公社七十七个生产队利用农业空闲时间修制竹木农具的社员，共有二千五百人。如果把他们担负的任务都集中到社办工厂，社办工厂就要增加六百二十五人，比这个社社办工业现有的人数还多。第二，生产队修制农业生产资料，可以因地制宜，因时制宜，更好地“围着农业生产转，跟着农事季节走”，同时可以充分利用本队资源，降低农业生产资料的成本。城西公社各个生产队利用当地丰富的野生草木，制造土农药、土化肥，比公社集中生产成本降低一半。第三，宜于生产队办的项目划给生产队以后，社办工业可以集中力量办好主要的工厂，腾出更多力量制造大型农业机具，研究改良农业机具。
    公社开展“巧农民”运动，生产和修补小农具，对于节省用于工业的劳动力和满足农业生产需要也起了不小的作用。“巧农民”运动开展得较好的城西公社，采取以师带徒、现场传授等方法，培养出二千多个“巧农民”；其中有五百多个已掌握了修补、制造竹木农具的全套技术，做到既能务农，又能做工，亦工亦农。社员们认为这种作法的好处是：充分利用了早晨、晚上、雨天等农活的零碎时间，充分发挥了半劳力、辅助劳力的作用，因此既能腾出壮年劳力参加田间生产，又能节约生产队开支。城西公社杨图生产队的一百五十个“巧农民”，在1至7月份就利用农业间隙时间制造竹垫、蓑衣等三千五百多件，修补农具五百八十多件，相当于竹木工人一千八百多个工作日的工作量，既及时供应了农业生产的需要，又节省了添购、修补小农具的费用一千多元。
    革新技术挖潜力
    开展技术革新和技术革命，大力提高劳动生产率，是临海县社办工业节约劳动力的一个重要环节。
    临海县的社办工厂一般都是白手起家，原来几乎全是手工操作。落后的手工操作蕴藏着巨大的劳动潜力。仅城西、大田、海游、双港等四个公社的社办工厂经过大闹技术革新，就增加了三十五台机器设备，劳动生产率提高了两倍，做到一人顶三人。
    临海县社办工业在技术革新和技术革命运动中，着重解决动力问题。这是因为没有动力，就谈不到用机械生产，而社办工业又分布在缺乏动力工业的广大农村，只有首先解决了动力问题，才能从落后的手工操作跨上机械化的骏马。城西、大田、海游、双港等四个公社的社办工业，共挖掘出动力资源四百四十四马力，带动了二百三十四台机器，使劳动效率大大提高。他们在解决动力问题的过程中，主要掌握了下面两条原则：一条是因地制宜，有什么动力资源，就挖掘什么动力资源。城西公社多溪流，他们就把工厂搬到溪边，充分利用当地丰富的水力资源。大田公社抽水机多，他们就设法综合利用抽水机；三十二台抽水机，带动了九十六台机器。有的公社还利用风力、潮汐作动力。再一条原则是因陋就简，土法上马，自己动手解决材料、设备和技术等方面的问题。城西公社缺少水轮机，社办木器厂和机械厂就自己动手制造，共生产了三十一台，满足了需要。双港等公社的社办工业为了解决动力问题，自己生产了土煤气机、土蒸汽机等设备。
    “管”字出劳力
    临海县社办工业还抓住了一个“管”字，大挖劳动潜力。这就是随着生产的发展，不断地加强社办工业的经营管理，改进劳动组织，建立和健全责任制度，合理使用劳动力。
    他们的具体作法是：第一，使劳动组织适应生产的发展。特别是随着技术革新和技术革命的深入开展，技术水平和生产效率提高了，劳动组织更要与之相适应。城关公社耐火材料厂两只窑原来要三班十二个人看火，因为革新了技术，缩短了烧窑时间，两班八个人就够了。这个厂及时调整了劳动组织，节约出了三分之一的劳动力。
    第二，建立和健全各种生产责任制。大田陶器厂实行定额管理以后，生产效率迅速提高，每人每天做陶器毛坯由十八只增加到二十八只，工效提高50％以上，每窑的产品由原来的一千六百件增加到二千零三十七件，正品率达到95％以上。
    第三，根据社办工业规模较小的特点，最大限度地降低非生产人员的比例。据调查，脱离生产的行政管理人员占职工总数的比例，城西公社社办工业为1.2％，大田公社社办工业为1.6％。一般人数不多的工厂，都没有全脱产的行政管理人员。他们减少脱产管理人员的主要办法是：发动工人群众利用业余时间，参加统计、保管、出纳等管理工作；一人兼数职，如厂长兼采购员、保管员，几个厂合设一名会计等；有些管理干部既作一部分管理工作，又经常参加劳动，半脱离生产或部分脱离生产。城西公社造纸厂厂长兼采购员，会计兼管食堂、出纳工作，发动职工业余搞，结果脱产管理干部减少了一半多，抽出一部分人加强了农业第一线。
    干劲——决定因素
    临海县社办工业作到少用人支援农业好的根本原因，是坚持政治挂帅，充分调动了职工支援农业的自觉性和生产的积极性。
    他们狠抓政治思想工作，经常向职工进行国民经济以农业为基础的教育，和发愤图强、勤俭办企业的教育。这些思想教育工作每深入一步，都大大地激发了职工的劳动热情，提高了生产效率。最近，各公社普遍以“为什么农业是国民经济的基础”、“工业必须大力支援农业”为题，发动群众讨论。通过摆事实，算细账，广大职工认识到农业和工业是“水涨船高”的关系，农业发展快，工厂生产就跃进得快。职工们纷纷表示，人要用得少，农业要支援得好。双港公社农具厂虽然有六十个人支援了农业第一线，而三百五十台打稻机木架的制造任务仍然提前十六天完成，生产效率提高了35.3％。
    这个县各社办工厂的领导干部坚持和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，使领导和群众的关系更加密切。双港公社从公社的工业书记到工厂党支部书记，厂长二十四人，平均有一大半时间参加劳动。工人们说：拿起锤头心连心，汗水交流更相亲，干部群众一股劲，支援农业大跃进。大田机械厂副厂长到铸工车间带头劳动，带头革新，鼓舞了职工的创造热情，全车间完成革新项目四十二件，劳动效率提高二点一倍，节省出一百一十二个劳动力。
    各社办工厂经常组织社会主义劳动竞赛。这几个公社的党委都把组织社办工业的劳动竞赛、开展“一顶几”运动，作为一项经常工作，不断地抓检查、抓评比，推动竞赛步步深入。各厂竞赛都以“谁为农业服务好”为中心，比质量，比数量，比赶在季节前面。双港公社机械厂和农具厂挂钩竞赛以后，大镰刀成品率由92％提高到100％，原来计划生产三千把，因为质量好，农民争着用，工人干劲越来越大，结果生产了一万六千多把。
