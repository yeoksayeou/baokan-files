    Please, readers, come and read the feature article "The Battle to Rescue Lives." After reading this feature, my heart was filled with excitement, and I could not calm down for a long time….

    In early August of this year, Liaoning Province suffered a massive flood, the worst in two hundred years. As the saying goes: strong grass is known in a high wind. Under the test of a great disaster, our Party and the people appear even more fearless and unyielding, striving to overcome the disaster with a spirit of human determination, minimizing the damage caused by the flood. In just a few days, countless anti-flood heroes emerged! "The Battle to Rescue Lives" only reflects one of them.

    This true story feature vividly depicts the glorious image of the great Chinese people. Chen Chungui, facing the raging flood, risked his life to rescue residents, fearless of danger, demonstrating the true character of a public security officer and cadre, and of the people, who grew up under the education of the Party. The expectations and gratitude of the victims only added to his immense strength. When he saw that in a situation where there was a risk of drowning every minute, mothers took their children, who could escape immediately from his shoulders, and replaced them with other people's children, his whole being was greatly shocked! In the Yuan Dynasty Zaju "Bao Zheng's Three Trials of the Butterfly Dream," the image of Mother Wang, praised by Guan Hanqing for protecting the two sons left by the former wife while sending her own son to pay for a life, would pale in comparison here. No wonder Chen Chungui secretly called out his own name and exclaimed: What kind of era do you live in?! What kind of people are these?! No wonder he cast a contemptuous glance at the vast expanse of water before him: Flood! A flood unseen in two hundred years! But we have a system and people unseen in thousands of years! In this way, he accumulated invincible strength and became even more resourceful and courageous.

    The events described in this feature took place on Dabu Street in Benxi City on the night of August 3, when the flood suddenly struck. However, it reflects the noble character of the great people of the entire Benxi City, the entire Liaoning Province, and the entire China. It is rare and valuable for a person, regardless of their position, such as a rescuer or a rescued person in the face of disaster, to demonstrate noble character. When possessing this noble character is not just the attribute of one person or a few people, but the common character of the entire people, it forms the characteristic of a great era. An ancient saying goes, wealth cannot corrupt, poverty cannot be moved, and power cannot subdue. The Chinese people have not only achieved these, but also, under the education of the Party and Mao Zedong Thought, are fearless in the face of danger, ready to act for a just cause, and selflessly dedicate themselves to the interests of the country and the people, and to the interests of the Party and the collective, which is now a common sight. Every time we see this noble character, seeing the radiating light of communist thought, how can we not admire and be inspired!

    光芒四射

    请读者们都来读一读《抢救生命的战斗》这篇特写。当我读完这篇特写时，心境激动不已，久久不能平静……。
    今年8月初，辽宁省遭到二百年不遇的特大洪水灾害。古语云：疾风知劲草。在巨大灾难的考验下，更显得我们的党和人民临危不惧，坚强不屈，以人定胜天的气概，奋力抢险，把洪水的灾害缩小到最低限度。几天之间，涌现的抗洪英雄何止万千！《抢救生命的战斗》只是反映了其中一个而已。
    这篇真实事迹的特写，深刻地刻划了伟大的中国人民的光辉形象。陈春贵面对汹涌的洪水，为了抢救居民出险，出生入死，无所畏惧，正是一个在党的教育下成长的公安人员和干部、人民的本色。受灾的人们的期待和感激，对他说来，无不增添巨大的力量。当他看到，在每分钟都有灭顶灾祸的危险境地，母亲们从他的肩上拉下马上得以逃生的自己的孩子，换上别人的孩子，他的全身心受到极大的震撼！元朝杂剧“包待制三勘蝴蝶梦”里，关汉卿所赞扬的护住前房留下的两个儿子，却叫自己亲生儿子去偿命的王母大贤大德的形象，在这里也会黯然失色。难怪陈春贵暗叫起自己的名字，赞叹道：你生活在什么样的时代？！这是些什么样的人民哪？！难怪他向眼前的一片汪洋投过轻蔑的一瞥：洪水！二百年来所没有的洪水！可是我们有几千年来所没有的制度和人民！这样，他蕴积了无敌的力量，更加机智，更加勇敢了。
    这篇特写所记述的事情，发生在本溪市大卜街上，发生在洪水突然袭来的8月3日夜里。但是，它却反映了全本溪市、全辽宁省、全中国伟大人民的崇高的品格。一个人，不问处于何种地位，譬如在灾害面前的救人者、或被救者，无不表现高尚的品格，是难能可贵的。当具备这种高尚的品格，不仅是一个人、少数人，而是整个人民的共同的品格的时候，就形成伟大时代的特征。古训说，富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈。中国人民不仅作到这一些，而且，在党和毛泽东思想的教育下，临危不惧，见义勇为，舍己为人，为了国家和人民的利益、为了党和集体的利益，可以奋不顾身，已是到处可见的事情。每当我们看到这种崇高的品格，看到共产主义思想光芒四射，怎能不令人景仰和振奋呵！
