Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong reported: At the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side, the 218th meeting of the secretaries of the Korean Military Armistice Commission was held on October 11th.

At the meeting, the secretary of the Korean-Chinese side lodged a stern protest with the US side against the recent provocative and hostile acts of the US side, such as sending military aircraft to intrude into our airspace and shooting at our personnel.

The secretary of the Korean-Chinese side said that at approximately 10:13 am on October 7, 1960, two US F-86 jet aircraft flew in from the southeast and, after flying low over the Han River estuary at an altitude of 1,000 meters, intruded into the airspace over Haxia Port near Guanshan, which is under our military control, and took hostile actions.

On September 28, 1960, and October 4, US non-military police personnel fired a total of seven bullets at our non-military police personnel who were performing routine patrol duties in the demilitarized zone.

The secretary of the Korean-Chinese side sternly pointed out that these hostile acts recently taken again by the US side, disregarding our repeated protests and warnings, seriously violate the Armistice Agreement, which is an agreement between both sides, and are a provocative act full of serious consequences. Our secretary strongly demanded that the US side, in accordance with Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement, severely punish all personnel involved in the aforementioned violations of the Armistice Agreement and take responsible measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

    朝中方面在军事停战委员会会议上
    抗议美方军事挑衅行为
    新华社平壤12日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：根据朝中方面建议，朝鲜军事停战委员会秘书长第二百一十八次会议在10月11日举行。
    在会上，朝中方面秘书长就美国最近派遣军用飞机侵入我方领空以及枪击我方人员等挑衅敌对行为向美方提出严正抗议。
    朝中方面秘书长说，1960年10月7日我方时间十时十三分左右，美方F—86型喷气飞机两架从东南方向飞来，在以一千米的高度低飞过汉江江口以后侵入我方军事控制下的关山附近下阻港里上空，并采取了敌对行动。
    1960年9月28日和10月4日，美方的非军事警察人员向在非军事地区执行通常的巡逻任务的我方非军事警察人员，共射击了七发子弹。
    朝中方面秘书长严厉指出，美方不顾我方一再抗议和警告而在最近再次采取的这些敌对行为严重违反双方协议的停战协定，是一种充满严重后果的挑衅行为。我方秘书长强硬要求美方根据停战协定第十三款严惩一切与上述违反停战协定事件有关的人员并采取负责措施防止今后发生类似事件。
