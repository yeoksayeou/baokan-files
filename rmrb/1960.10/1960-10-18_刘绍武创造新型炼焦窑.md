Liu Shaowu's new coking oven has the following advantages: continuous, fast, and balanced coke output, high yield, good quality, and low cost; the oven is built only with sand, stone, mud, and blue bricks, and can be built and put into production in two or three days. The production technology is simple and easy to learn.

Chengdu, October 17th (Reported by this newspaper) - Liu Shaowu, a coking worker and Communist Party member at the Dujiang Coal Mine in Sichuan Province, has successfully created a new type of coking oven suitable for widespread promotion, called the "Innovation No. 2 Coking Oven," by combining the advantages of the Simple No. 2 Coke Oven and the Pingxiang Oven, using local methods. This type of coke oven does not require any foreign equipment, nor does it use steel, cement, or refractory bricks. The coking time is generally only 36 hours, and the yield of coke from fine coal reaches over 70%. The coke output is high, the quality is good, and the cost is low. It can continuously and evenly produce coke every day, opening up a new path for developing coke production in a faster, better, and more economical way.

Liu Shaowu is an old worker with ten years of mining experience and a pace-setter in the technical revolution at the Dujiang Coal Mine. Since he took on the leadership of the coking yard at the No. 4 well of the Dujiang Coal Mine last year, he has often been troubled by the fact that coke production could not keep up with the needs of the blast furnace. In December last year, when he heard that the Simple No. 2 Coke Oven had a fast coking time and high output, and that the top of the oven did not need to be covered with mud bricks or slag during coking, and was not afraid of rainstorms, he actively organized workers to experiment with it in their spare time. Following the principles of the Simple No. 2 Coke Oven, they built an earthen oven with yellow mud and stones, adopting the method of staggered loading of coal, staggered coke output, and continuous production, shortening the coking time from loading coal to coke output from more than a week in the past to about 50 hours. The workers named this new type of coke oven they created "Innovation No. 1." However, in the experiment, due to lack of technical experience and refractory materials, the temperature inside the oven was too high, and the top of the oven was burned through before long.

Failure did not discourage Liu Shaowu. With the encouragement of the Party branch and the support of the masses, he persisted in experimenting. In April this year, when Liu Shaowu was inspecting the coking situation at the coking yard, he discovered that the fine coal inside the Pingxiang Oven was still burning vigorously after the combustion-supporting coal was burned. "If the partition walls between each grid of the 'Innovation No. 1' coke oven are removed, and the top of the oven is built into an arch, using the heat of the burning fine coal to directly coke, wouldn't the coking efficiency be higher than that of the Simple No. 2 Coke Oven, and also save on the combustion-supporting coal?" As soon as he put forward this idea, it immediately received the support of the coal mine Party committee and the coking workers. They decided to experiment on the No. 4 Pingxiang Oven. However, in the process of the experiment, they encountered a series of problems: without partition walls inside the oven, the coke would be burned into a large cake, how could it be taken out? If the top of the oven is built into a through arch, it will bear a lot of pressure and also have to withstand high temperatures, where can such good materials be found? Liu Shaowu repeatedly considered the matter. He remembered the experience that when coking in the past, some wood chips were not picked out of the fine coal, and the coke could not stick together where there were wood chips, and that during the double-layer oven firing, the coke naturally stratified due to different ignition times. Therefore, when loading the oven, he used firewood to separate the fine coal into several small pieces, successfully solving the problem of coke fragmentation. Without good materials for building the arch skin, they used mud bricks instead. After many experiments, they finally built a new type of coking oven.

The first batch of the new type of coke oven started producing coke in only forty hours, and the quality of the coke was very good. The ash content was also much lower than that of "Innovation No. 1." And after many rainstorms, it is still in normal production.

After more than four months of actual production, it has been proven that this new type of coking oven fully utilizes the natural heating ability of fine coal. Although it does not have equipment such as exhaust fans and electric motors, the coking temperature reaches as high as 900 degrees to 1100 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the coke output is fast, and the daily output level is equal to that of the same scale Simple No. 2 Coke Oven. Compared with the Pingxiang Oven, it has more advantages such as fewer processes (no bricklaying, no covering with bricks), no need for combustion-supporting coal, no need for manual fire-watching, continuous, fast, and balanced coke output, and no fear of rainstorm attacks. For example, the coking cycle of the Pingxiang Oven is generally about seven days, while the "Innovation No. 2" only takes 36 hours, and the output is about six times higher than that of the Pingxiang Oven. When coking, the top of the oven is not covered with ash slag, and there is less external ash content. Coke made from the same fine coal has 3.5% less ash content than the Pingxiang Oven. Because the output is high and the labor force is small, each ton of coke uses 50 kilograms less of combustion-supporting coal, and the unit cost is only 23.1% of that of the Pingxiang Oven. The structure of the "Innovation No. 2" coke oven is very simple, and all the materials used are local sand, stone, mud, blue bricks, etc. Therefore, it only costs more than one hundred yuan to renovate a Pingxiang Oven, and it can be built and put into production in two or three days. Because of the low investment, quick returns, and simple and easy-to-learn production technology, it is very popular among coal miners in various places. Since the third quarter, it has been widely promoted throughout Sichuan Province.

The appearance of the "Innovation No. 2" coke oven has fundamentally changed the production outlook of local coking methods. The "Innovation No. 2" coke oven used by Liu Shaowu for experiments, from the time it was lit in May to the present, relies entirely on the spontaneous combustion of fine coal for coking. It has not stopped production, nor does it require manual firing. Production has increased several times, and the labor of the coking workers is very relaxed and pleasant. Recently, according to the suggestions of the fraternal coal miners who came to visit, when helping the No. 3 Well to build the "Innovation No. 2" coke oven, Liu Shaowu also narrowed the grids of the coke oven and heightened the oven body and chimney, so that the daily coke production capacity has reached about 30 tons, exceeding the production level of the local Simple No. 2 Coke Oven, while the labor force used is only one-third of that of the Simple No. 2 Coke Oven. Therefore, the workers could not help but write poems praising it: "Innovation No. 2" is really good, no one burns the fire, it is automatically coked, the processes are reduced by several, the output quality is greatly improved, the new creation of local coking method, the innovation red flag is flying in the wind.

    刘绍武创造新型炼焦窑
    这种炼焦窑的优点是：连续、快速、均衡出焦，产量高、质量好、成本低；建窑材料只用砂石、泥土、青砖，两三天就可建成投入生产，生产技术简单易学
    本报成都17日电　四川省都江煤矿炼焦工人、共产党员刘绍武集中简易二号焦窑和萍乡窑的优点，用土办法创造成功了一种适合普遍推广的新型炼焦窑革新二号炼焦窑。这种焦窑不用任何洋设备，也不用钢材、水泥和耐火砖，结焦时间一般只需三十六小时，精煤成焦率达到70％以上，焦炭产量高，质量好，成本低，可以每天连续、均衡出焦，为多快好省地发展焦炭生产开辟了一条新的道路。
    刘绍武是一个有十年矿山生活经历的老工人，都江煤矿技术革命的标兵。他从去年担任都江煤矿四井炼焦场的领导职务以来，经常为焦炭生产供不上高炉需要而苦恼。去年12月份，当他听说简易二号焦窑结焦时间快，产量高，炼焦时窑顶不复盖泥砖、灰渣，又不怕暴雨袭击时，就积极组织工人，利用业余时间试验起来。他们仿照简易二号焦窑的原理，用黄泥巴和石块修成一个土窑子，采取间格装煤、间格出焦、连续生产的方法，使炼焦时间从装煤到出焦，由过去一个多星期缩短到五十小时左右。工人们给这种自己创造的新型焦窑取名叫做“革新一号”。但在试验中因为技术上没有经验，又缺少耐火材料，窑内温度太高，不久就把窑顶烧穿了。
    失败并没有使刘绍武灰心。在党支部的鼓励和群众的支持下，他坚持试验下去。今年4月，刘绍武在焦场检查炼焦情况时，发现萍乡窑在助燃煤烧过以后，窑内精煤还烧得很旺。“如果将“革新一号”焦窑每个格子之间的隔墙去掉，窑顶砌成拱形，利用精煤燃烧的热力直接炼焦，既可节约助燃煤，又可提高焦窑温度，不是比简易二号焦窑炼焦效率更高吗？”他把这个想法一提出来，就立即受到煤矿党委和炼焦工人的支持。他们决定在四号萍乡窑上进行试验。但在试验过程中又遇到了一连串的问题：窑内没有隔墙，焦炭烧成一块大饼，怎么取得出来？窑顶砌通拱，承受压力大，又要耐高温，哪里去找这样好的材料？刘绍武反复地考虑，他想起过去炼焦时，精煤中有些木渣没有拣干净，夹有木渣的地方焦炭就不能粘结在一起，以及烧双层窑时由于发火时间不同，焦炭自然分层的经验，于是在装窑的时候，就用木柴将精煤隔成若干小块，成功地解决了焦炭分块问题。砌拱皮没有好材料，就用泥巴砖代替，经过多次试验，终于把一座新型的炼焦窑修建起来了。
    新型焦窑第一窑只四十多个小时就开始出焦，焦炭质量很好，比“革新一号”所含灰分又降低了很多，并且经过多次暴雨的考验，现在仍在继续正常生产。
    经过四个多月的实际生产证明，这种新型炼焦窑由于充分利用了精煤自然的发热能力，虽然没有抽风机、电动机等设备，但炼焦时却达到九百多度到一千一百度的高温，因此出焦快，日产水平与同等规模的简易二号焦窑相等，与萍乡窑相比较，更具有工序少（不打砖、不盖砖）、不用助燃煤，不用人工看火，连续、快速、均衡出焦以及不怕暴雨袭击等优越性。例如，萍乡窑炼焦周期一般都在七天左右，“革新二号”却只要三十六小时，产量比萍乡窑高六倍左右；炼焦时窑顶不复盖灰渣，外来灰分少，同样精煤炼出的焦炭，灰分比萍乡窑低3.5％；因为产量高，使用劳动力少，每吨焦炭少用五十公斤助燃煤，单位成本只及萍乡窑的23.1％。“革新二号”焦窑的结构十分简单，所用材料全部是取自当地的砂石、泥土、青砖等。因此改造一座萍乡窑只花一百多元，两三天时间就建成投入生产。由于投资少，收效快，加上生产技术简便易学，很受各地煤矿工人的欢迎，从第三季度以来已在四川全省大量推广。
    “革新二号”焦窑的出现，从根本上改变了土法炼焦的生产面貌。刘绍武用作试验的“革新二号”焦窑，从5月份点火直到目前为止，完全依靠精煤自燃炼焦，既没有停窑，也不用人工烧火，生产增长了好几倍，炼焦工人的劳动却十分轻松愉快。最近刘绍武根据前来参观的兄弟煤矿工人们的建议，在帮助三井建设“革新二号”焦窑时，又将焦窑的格子改窄，窑身和烟囱加高，使日产焦炭能力已达到三十吨左右，超过了当地简易二号焦窑的生产水平，而使用的劳动力只及简易二号焦窑的三分之一。因此工人们情不自禁地写诗歌颂道：“革新二号”真正好，无人烧火自炼焦，工序减少好几道，产量质量大提高，土法炼焦新创造，革新红旗迎风飘。（附图片）
    太原钢铁公司职工以班组为主，掀起了竞赛热潮。首创三槽出钢的第一炼钢厂党委书记和老工人、技术人员组成了“三结合”技术表演团，迅速传播新技术，猛攻冶炼时间关，连续创造了三十七次生产新纪录。
