Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang. The workers on the Guizhou Province transportation front launched a "Repair One Million (Automobile) Parts from Old Stock" campaign. From August to the present, they have repaired over 2.74 million old and discarded parts, thereby increasing the vehicle completion rate by 32.4% compared to before. Freight volume and turnover have increased by 45% and 58.71% respectively. In particular, the transport volume of key materials has increased significantly.

The "Repair One Million Parts from Old Stock" campaign carried out by transportation workers in various parts of Guizhou all focused on improving the vehicle completion rate as the main objective. Leading cadres and workers of the Provincial Transportation Company's joint venture depot worked together to discover that some previously out-of-service vehicles were mainly due to damage to the pinion and crown gears and the front gearboxes. The unit specifically organized experienced veteran technicians and technical personnel to gather the old, scrapped pinion and crown gears from the past. After identification, they were classified and lined up, and repaired separately, thus reviving many vehicles that had been out of service for a long time due to a lack of these parts. The depot's vehicle completion rate increased from 77% in June to over 90%, effectively promoting production. Through the repair of old parts, the Bijie Transportation Company rushed to repair 1,500 key parts such as front gearboxes, steel spring assemblies, and motors/generators, solving the problem of waiting for materials to repair vehicles. The Tongren Transportation Company, through a three-way combination of leading cadres, technical personnel, and drivers, inspected all vehicles one by one. Then, based on the material shortage situation, they organized the masses to clear inventory and ascertain the situation. They adopted methods such as piecing together, repairing, chiseling, welding, riveting, and inlaying to revive discarded old parts for vehicle repair, resolutely preventing any vehicle from being out of service. They also manufactured more than ten kinds of main parts, such as the main shaft of the gearbox and the second and third gear sliding gears. Therefore, they not only solved the problem of vehicles being out of service due to missing parts in their own unit, but also supported brother companies.

Through the "Repair One Million Parts from Old Stock" campaign, various localities not only solved the problem of general parts needed for daily vehicle maintenance and improved the vehicle completion rate, but also some departments had a certain amount of spare parts reserves.

    贵州交通运输职工自己动手战胜困难
    修复汽车配件二百七十万件
    满足汽车一般维修需要，并有一定数量储备
    新华社贵阳电　贵州省交通运输战线职工开展“修旧百万件（汽车配件）”运动，从8月开始到目前，已修复旧废配件二百七十四万多件，从而使车辆完好率比前提高32.4％，货运量、周转量都分别提高45％和58.71％，特别是重点物资的运输量有了大幅度的增长。
    贵州各地交通运输战线职工开展“修旧百万件”运动，都以提高车辆完好率作为主要内容。省运输公司合营场领导干部和工人一起，发现过去一些停驶的汽车，主要是因为车上的盆角牙和前牙箱损坏。这个单位就专门组织经验丰富的老技工与技术人员，将过去报废的旧盆角牙集中起来，经过鉴定，分类排队，分别进行修理，从而使许多因缺少这种配件而长期停驶的车辆复活了。这个场的完好车率由6月份的77％提高到90％以上，有效地促进了生产。毕节运输公司通过修旧运动，突击修理出前牙箱、钢板总成、马达发电机等关键性的配件一千五百件，解决了修车待料的问题。铜仁运输公司由领导干部、技术人员和驾驶员三结合，逐辆检查所有车辆，然后根据待料情况组织群众清仓摸底，采取拼、修、凿、焊、铆、镶等办法，复活废旧的配件，用来修车，坚决不让一辆车停驶。他们并且制成牙箱主轴和二、三档流动牙等十多种主要配件，因此不仅解决了本单位车辆缺件停驶的问题，还支援了兄弟公司。
    各地通过“修旧百万件”运动，不仅解决了日常维修车辆需要的一般配件问题，提高了车辆的完好率，而且有些部门还有了一定数量的配件储备。
