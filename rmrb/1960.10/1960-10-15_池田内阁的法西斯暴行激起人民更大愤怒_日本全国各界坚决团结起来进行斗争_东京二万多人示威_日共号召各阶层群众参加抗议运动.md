Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th Dispatch: More than 20,000 workers and people from all walks of life in Tokyo held a demonstration on the bustling streets of downtown Tokyo tonight, protesting the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, chairman of the Socialist Party, and demanding the immediate resignation of the Ikeda Cabinet.

The demonstrating masses carried a huge portrait of Asanuma. They held high flags, carried lanterns, and angrily waved their fists, shouting: "The Ikeda Cabinet should be held responsible!" "Ikeda, resign!" "Down with the Ikeda Cabinet!" "Dismiss the Superintendent General of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department!" At the same time, broadcasting trucks accompanying the procession continuously shouted slogans through loudspeakers. Some people also used loudspeakers to make speeches, condemning the Ikeda Cabinet for helping fascist thugs and calling on people to take action to defend democracy.

Before the parade, the angry masses held a protest meeting in Hibiya Park. Speakers at the meeting included Hideo Yamahana, representative of the Socialist Party, Yoshinobu Monma, vice chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and Akeyoshi Inamura, chairman of the Tokyo Regional Council of Trade Unions. They unanimously emphasized that the Ikeda Cabinet should bear the responsibility for the murder of Asanuma and resign immediately.

Hideo Yamahana recalled that after the famous Japanese left-wing politician Senji Yamamoto was assassinated by fascists, the war of aggression against China immediately broke out. He said, "We will never allow history to repeat itself. We must stop all terrorist conspiracies."

Hideo Yamahana then said that although the Socialist Party had lost its chairman, it would never retreat but would advance together with the masses of the people.

Yoshinobu Monma and Akeyoshi Inamura emphasized that the responsibility for the assassination clearly lies with the Ikeda Cabinet, the Liberal Democratic Party, and Japanese monopoly capital. He emphasized that everyone would understand this if they traced the conspiracy of the murder to its roots.

They called on the participants to continue to take strong protest actions so that Asanuma would not have sacrificed in vain.

The remains of Inejiro Asanuma were sent to the crematorium in Edogawa Ward this afternoon by about 500 Socialist Party members and Tokyo citizens. As the funeral car passed through the streets of Asanuma's constituency of Koto and Edogawa, about 50,000 workers holding red flags, housewives in aprons, and others stood by the roadside, offering silent prayers to the hearse. People flocked to the crematorium to mourn.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th Dispatch: The atrocities of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries in assassinating Inejiro Asanuma, chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, have aroused a wave of protests in Japan, and people everywhere are demanding the total resignation of the Ikeda Cabinet.

The Aichi Prefectural Council of Trade Unions, the Federation of Neutral Trade Unions, and the Aichi Prefectural Federation of the Socialist Party held a prefectural protest rally in Nagoya today, attended by 30,000 workers and citizens, strongly protesting the fascist atrocities of killing Asanuma.

The people of Osaka City also held a protest rally and demonstration parade of 1,000 people tonight.

Three hundred workers of the Nagoya National Railway held a protest rally in front of Nagoya Railway Station on the 13th. On the same day, teachers, students, and staff of the Faculty of Medicine of Nagoya University held a protest gathering.

The Tochigi Prefectural Council of Trade Unions and the Tochigi Prefectural Federation of the Socialist Party held a "Protest Against the Assassination of Asanuma Rally" at the Utsunomiya City Gymnasium on the afternoon of the 13th. The congress sent a telegram requesting the Ikeda government to investigate the behind-the-scenes relations of the criminals, severely punish the criminals and relevant responsible persons, and resolutely demand the immediate collective resignation of the Ikeda Cabinet.

In Mito City, the Mito City Committee for Abolishing the "Security Treaty" held a protest rally on the 13th, attended by 300 representatives of citizens.

On the same morning, 500 tobacco workers in Mito belonging to the "All Monopoly Labor Union" held a one-hour workplace rally, expressing strong protest against the fascist thugs' killing of Asanuma.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th Dispatch: The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued instructions in today's "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper, calling on all members of the JCP to strive for more extensive participation of people from all walks of life in the movement to protest the assassination of Asanuma and demand the immediate resignation of the Ikeda Cabinet.

The JCP Central Committee pointed out in its instructions that Socialist Party Chairman Asanuma has been murdered by fascist thugs, and the situation currently facing the Japanese people is very serious. Therefore, all party members should do their best to organize various forms of struggle throughout the country, such as strikes, rallies, and demonstrations, and mobilize as many people as possible to participate in the large-scale protest demonstration on the 15th, striving to successfully hold the "National Congress Against the New Security Treaty and Protesting the Assassination of Asanuma" on the 20th.

The JCP Central Committee emphasized that the demands in the protest struggle must be: thoroughly investigate the behind-the-scenes relations of the assassination of Asanuma, severely punish the criminals; immediately dissolve anti-communist right-wing violent groups and fascist groups, dismiss the Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police Department and relevant responsible persons of the police authorities; investigate the incident at the special session of the Diet, investigate the responsibility of the Ikeda Cabinet, and force the Ikeda Cabinet to resign.

The JCP Central Committee emphasized that the unity of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and trade unions, as well as all democratic forces, to carry out the struggle is the basic condition for winning the protest struggle.

The JCP Central Committee also called on the people of all regions to establish action committees against militarism and fascism in their workplaces and regions, and at the same time organize mass guard teams to protect the activists of democratic forces from attacks by fascist thugs.
