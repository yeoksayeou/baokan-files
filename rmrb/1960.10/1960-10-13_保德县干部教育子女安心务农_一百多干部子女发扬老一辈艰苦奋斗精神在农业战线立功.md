Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th—One hundred and sixty cadre children in Baode County, Shanxi Province, have inherited and carried forward the fine traditions of hard work and thrift of the older generation, making contributions on the agricultural front. Many of them have become leading backbones above the level of deputy leader of production teams in the communes, or active elements in agricultural production.

The fact that these cadre children are content with agricultural work is inseparable from their parents' education. Many veteran cadres in Baode County often educate their children in plain living and hard struggle through explaining stories of revolutionary struggle, especially educating them to love the countryside and agricultural labor. Yang Bingzhi, the son of Yang Fuguo, the director of the supply and marketing cooperative of Jiajiamao Commune, was once uneasy about agricultural labor, thinking that agricultural labor was hard and had "little future." After Yang Fuguo discovered that his son had this erroneous idea, he repeatedly educated him on the correct understanding of the question of future, pointing out that the needs of the Party and the people are our future; if we leave the needs of the Party and the people and are unwilling to engage in hard labor, we will not have a future in anything we do. Yang Fuguo also told his son the story of the arduous struggle during the War of Resistance Against Japan, telling him, "You are truly unaware of the blessings you have today." Under his father's earnest teachings, Yang Bingzhi corrected his erroneous thinking and worked very actively. This year, he has been elected as the production team leader by the masses. Zhang Huaishu, the son of Zhang Manxi, the Party Secretary of Balougou Commune, saw that his father ate, lived, worked, and consulted with the commune members, and thought: "My father has participated in the revolution for more than twenty years, and he still loves agricultural labor so much, I should participate well in agricultural production." Therefore, after graduating from middle school, he resolutely participated in agricultural labor and took the lead in labor everywhere.

Many cadre children humbly learn agricultural techniques from the masses in their agricultural production. Hu Runsheng, the son of Hu Aimin, the Deputy Party Secretary of the Majiatan Iron Factory, returned home to participate in production after graduating from junior high school. He took old farmers as his teachers, studied diligently, and in less than a year, he learned a whole set of production techniques such as plowing, sowing, harrowing, grabbing manure, sowing, weeding, topdressing, and harvesting. The commune members said, "Runsheng is a true son of a peasant family."

Many cadre children not only engage in agriculture in a down-to-earth manner, but also actively influence and motivate other rural youths. This spring, the Baode County Party Committee called on young people to go up the mountains to reclaim wasteland. Some young people in Jiajialiang Management District of Dongguan Commune could not endure this hardship and did not respond positively. At this time, Qian Xusheng, the son of Qian Pengde, the Party Secretary of Dongguan Commune, was the first to sign up to go up the mountain. Under his leadership, Zhang Zhanlin and four other young people and a middle-aged commune member also signed up to go up the mountain. The six of them drove two oxen to Hejia Mountain, more than ninety miles away from the village, and after only half a month of labor, they planted more than forty mu of crops such as yellow mang, flax, and millet.

    保德县干部教育子女安心务农
    一百多干部子女发扬老一辈艰苦奋斗精神在农业战线立功
    新华社太原12日电　山西省保德县一百六十名在乡的干部子女，继承和发扬了老一辈艰苦奋斗、克勤克俭的优良传统，在农业战线上作出了贡献。他们当中有许多人已成为公社的生产队副队长以上的领导骨干，或农业生产中的积极分子。
    这些干部子女安心务农，是和父母对他们的教育分不开的。保德县的许多老干部，经常通过讲解革命斗争故事等办法，对自己的子女进行艰苦朴素的教育，特别是教育他们热爱农村，热爱农业劳动。贾家峁公社供销合作社主任杨富国的儿子杨秉智，一度不安心农业劳动，认为农业劳动苦，“前途不大”。杨富国发现儿子有这种错误思想后，三番五次地教育他正确认识前途问题，指出党和人民的需要，就是我们的前途；离开党和人民的需要，不愿意从事艰苦的劳动，干什么也不会有前途。杨富国还给儿子讲抗日战争时期艰苦斗争的故事，告诉他“你今天真是身在福中不知福。”杨秉智在父亲的谆谆教诲下，改正了自己的错误思想，劳动很积极，今年已被群众选为生产队长。扒楼沟公社党委书记张满喜的儿子张怀树，看到自己父亲和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，就想：“我父亲参加革命二十多年了，还那样热爱农业劳动，我更应该好好地参加农业生产。”因此他在中学毕业后，毅然参加了农业劳动，并且在劳动中处处带头。
    许多干部子女在从事农业生产中，虚心地向群众学习农业技术。马家滩铁厂党总支副书记胡爱民的儿子胡润生，高小毕业后回家参加生产，拜老农为师，勤学苦练，不到一年时间便学会了扶犁、摇耧、耙耱、抓粪、播种、锄田追肥、收割等一整套生产技术。社员们说：“润生是地地道道的庄户人家的儿子。”
    许多干部子女不但自己踏踏实实从事农业，而且积极影响和带动其他农村青年。今年春天，中共保德县委号召青年上山开垦荒地，东关公社贾家梁管理区有些青年吃不下这份苦，不积极响应。这时，东关公社党支书钱彭德的儿子钱许生就第一个报名上山。在他的带动下，张占林等四个青年和一个壮年社员也报名上山。他们六个人赶着两头黄牛，到了离村九十多里的贺家山，只经过半个月时间的劳动，就种下了黄芒、葫麻、糜子等作物四十多亩。
