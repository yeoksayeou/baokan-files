    Conspiracy to pave the way for the Northeast Asia Aggression Bloc.
    Ikeda government and Chang Myon puppet clique hold talks
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: The Japanese Ikeda government and the South Korean Chang Myon puppet clique resumed their so-called "Japan-South Korea talks" in Tokyo today to discuss the issue of "normalization of relations" and pave the way for the establishment of a Northeast Asia aggressive military alliance orchestrated by the United States.
    The chief representatives of the Japanese government, Renzo Sawada, and the chief representatives of the South Korean puppet clique, Yoo Chin-o, emphasized the necessity of "establishing new relations and friendship" between the two sides during the talks.
    In order to establish a Northeast Asia military alliance including Japan, the South Korean puppet clique, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, in accordance with the requirements of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the Ikeda cabinet immediately began to "improve" relations between Japan and the South Korean puppet clique after coming to power.

    据新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本池田政府和南朝鲜张勉傀儡集团今天在东京恢复所谓“日韩会谈”，来讨论“关系正常化”问题，为建立美国策划的东北亚侵略军事同盟铺设道路。
    日本政府首席代表泽田廉三和南朝鲜傀儡集团首席代表俞镇午在会谈中强调双方“建立新关系和亲善”的必要性。
    为了根据新日美“安全条约”要求，建立包括日本、南朝鲜傀儡集团和蒋介石集团在内的东北亚军事同盟，池田内阁上台以后立即着手“改善”日本和南朝鲜傀儡集团的关系。
