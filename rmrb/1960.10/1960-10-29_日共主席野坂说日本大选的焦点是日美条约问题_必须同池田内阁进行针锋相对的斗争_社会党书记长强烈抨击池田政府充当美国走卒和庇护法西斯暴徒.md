Xinhua News Agency, October 28th, Tokyo dispatch: According to today's "Akahata" report, the Japanese Communist Party held a representative meeting of local organizations on the 26th to discuss election plans.

    Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka emphasized in his speech that during the election campaign, it is necessary to boldly propose policies that are tit-for-tat against the reactionary policies of the Liberal Democratic Party.

    Nosaka pointed out that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" should be strongly condemned, as well as the policy of reviving militarism and Ikeda's deceptive economic policies, including the plan to "double national income."

    Nosaka also said that Japanese Communist Party candidates should also emphasize the issue of Japan's neutrality in their campaign speeches.

    After this meeting, the Japanese Communist Party launched a full-scale election campaign. The Communist Party's eleven leaders will hold election travel speeches across the country based on the decisions of the meeting.

    According to reports, more and more people from all walks of life are expressing support for the Japanese Communist Party, including film director Satsuo Yamamoto, Christian pastor Sakae Akaiwa, and writer Seijiro Kojima, among many other well-known scholars and cultural leaders.

    The Japan National Tax Office Employees' Union wrote to the Japan Socialist Party and the Communist Party on the 24th, requesting the two parties to cooperate in the election campaign.

    The letter requested the two parties to work hard to strengthen the national and local national conferences to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" so that the "Security Treaty" issue becomes the central issue of the election campaign.

Xinhua News Agency, October 28th, Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka published a talk in today's Sunday edition of "Akahata," commenting on the upcoming general election in Japan.

    Nosaka pointed out that the holding of this general election was obtained through the struggle of the Japanese people. Therefore, the focus of the election struggle must be the issue of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    Nosaka strongly condemned the Ikeda Cabinet, which took over from the forced-to-step-down Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet, for putting forward so-called "new policies" to deceive the people, delay the election time, and use the time to accelerate the implementation of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    Nosaka pointed out that the "Security Treaty" means stepping up the revival of militarism and fascism in Japan, and the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma reflects the Ikeda government's reactionary politics. Nosaka said that the murderer of Asanuma was clearly related to the Liberal Democratic Party, the Japanese monopoly capital group, and U.S. intelligence agencies.

    Nosaka pointed out that the essence of the Ikeda government's so-called "new policy" is to serve monopoly capital and strengthen reactionary rule. He also exposed the deceptiveness of the "new policy." He said that we should thoroughly expose the Ikeda government's "new policy" in the election campaign.

    Nosaka emphasized that we are welcoming the general election at a time when the domestic and international situation is favorable to us. Internationally, socialist forces and peace forces are further overwhelming imperialist forces. Domestically, through the struggle against the "Security Treaty," the broad masses of the Japanese people have raised their political awareness, and more than 2,500 joint struggle organizations centered on the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party have been established nationwide. On the other hand, the contradictions within the ruling class are deepening.

    When talking about the important factors for winning the election, Nosaka particularly emphasized the fact that the strength of the Japanese Communist Party has doubled in the past year.

    Nosaka emphasized that we should strive for victory in the general election, overthrow the Ikeda Cabinet, and establish a democratic united government against the "Security Treaty." He said that only by taking this path can we open up a path for Japan to move towards independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality. Nosaka said that the JCP will devote all its efforts to achieving these goals.

Xinhua News Agency, October 27th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japan Socialist Party held its first campaign speech meeting after the dissolution of the Japanese Diet in Osaka City on the 26th. Socialist Party Secretary-General Saburo Eda delivered a speech to 2,500 listeners, strongly criticizing the Ikeda government for shielding fascist thugs and implementing a reactionary policy of acting as a U.S. lackey.

    Eda said that the Ikeda government and the Liberal Democratic Party condoned the far-right terrorists in assassinating Socialist Party Chairman Asanuma. Not only do they show no remorse, but they deliberately equate the masses' movement to defend democracy with the terrorist acts of far-right elements, and openly shield the terrorist acts of far-right elements.

    Eda said that the focus of the upcoming general election is the "Security Treaty" issue. He said that although the Ikeda government is trying its best to dilute this point, the Socialist Party still believes it is so.

    Eda criticized Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda's argument that the Japanese people's demand for neutrality is a "fantasy." Eda pointed out that neutral diplomacy has now become a realistic policy. Otherwise, Japan will become an "orphan of Asia."

    Eda condemned the "UN-centered" policy pursued by the Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party. He pointed out that this policy is actually a policy of "America first."

    Eda said that the Socialist Party will adhere to an independent and neutral foreign policy, and at the same time, it will work to abolish the military alliance between Japan and the United States as soon as possible, so that Japan can get rid of its task as a "lackey" of the United States in Asia, and further strive to establish friendly relations with all countries.

    Eda then exposed the deceptiveness of the Ikeda government's so-called "new policy" to achieve "high growth" in the Japanese economy. He said that in essence, this is nothing more than a reactionary policy to greatly reduce the taxes of monopoly capital enterprises to serve monopoly capital. He also pointed out that this economic policy will go bankrupt. He said that the Socialist Party will actively smash this policy.

    Eda finally said that the Socialist Party will strive to have more candidates elected in the general election to打击 [dǎ jī, strike; hit; attack; crack down on] the Liberal Democratic Party. Eda said that he believed that only in this way can a government be established that fully implements the Japanese Constitution and establishes friendly relations with all countries.

    At this campaign speech meeting, Japan Socialist Party advisors Mozaburo Suzuki, Jotaro Kawakami, and Education and Propaganda Minister Seiichi Katsumada also spoke.

    日共主席野坂说日本大选的焦点是日美条约问题
    必须同池田内阁进行针锋相对的斗争
    社会党书记长强烈抨击池田政府充当美国走卒和庇护法西斯暴徒
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，日本共产党26日召开地方组织的代表会议，讨论了竞选计划。
    日本共产党主席野坂参三在会上讲话时强调在竞选运动中必须大胆提出同自由民主党的反动政策针锋相对的政策。
    野坂指出，应当着重地谴责新日美“安全条约”，谴责复活军国主义的政策和池田的欺骗性的经济政策，其中包括使“国民收入增加一倍”的计划。
    野坂又说，日本共产党候选人在竞选演说中还应当强调日本的中立问题。
    从这次会议以后，日本共产党展开了全面的竞选运动。共产党的十一位领导人将根据会议的决定在全国举行竞选旅行演说。
    据报道，表示支持日本共产党的各界人民越来越多，其中包括电影导演山本萨夫、基督教牧师赤岩荣和作家小岛政二郎等许多著名学者和文化界领袖。
    日本全国税职员工会24日写信给日本社会党和共产党，要求两党在竞选运动中合作。
    这封信要求两党努力加强全国的和地方的阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议，以便使得“安全条约”问题成为竞选运动的中心问题。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本共产党主席野坂参三在今天出版的“赤旗报”星期日版上发表谈话，评论日本即将举行的大选。
    野坂指出，这次大选的举行是依靠日本人民的斗争获得的。因此，大选的斗争焦点必须是新日美“安全条约”问题。
    野坂强烈谴责接替被迫下台的岸信介内阁而上台的池田内阁，提出所谓“新政策”来欺骗人民，拖延大选时间，并利用时间加紧实施新日美“安全条约”。
    野坂指出“安全条约”意味着在日本加紧复活军国主义和法西斯主义，浅沼稻次郎被杀害事件反映了池田政府这种反动政治。野坂说，杀害浅沼的凶犯显然是同自由民主党、日本垄断资本集团以及美国情报机关有关系的。
    野坂指出，池田政府的所谓“新政策”的本质是为垄断资本服务、加强反动统治。他并且揭露了“新政策”的欺骗性。他说，我们应该在竞选运动中彻底揭露池田政府的“新政策”。
    野坂强调指出，我们在国内外形势有利于我们的时候迎接了大选。在国际上，社会主义力量和和平力量进一步压倒帝国主义势力。在国内，通过反对“安全条约”斗争，广大日本人民提高了政治觉悟，全国已经成立了以日本共产党和社会党为中心的两千五百多个共同斗争组织。另一方面，统治阶级内部矛盾日益加深。
    野坂谈到在这次选举中取得胜利的重要因素时特别强调指出了一年来日本共产党的力量加强了一倍这一事实。
    野坂强调指出，应该争取大选胜利，打倒池田内阁，建立反对“安全条约”的民主联合政府。他说，只有走这一条路才能开辟日本走向独立、和平、民主、中立的道路。野坂表示，日共将全力为实现这些目标而奋斗。
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本社会党26日在大阪市举行日本国会解散后的首次竞选演说会。社会党书记长江田三郎对两千五百名听众发表演说，强烈抨击池田政府庇护法西斯暴徒并执行充当美国走卒的反动政策。
    江田说，池田政府和自由民主党纵容极右翼恐怖分子杀害了社会党委员长浅沼。它们不仅毫无悔悟，而且故意把群众为维护民主的运动同极右翼分子的恐怖行为混为一谈，公开庇护极右翼分子的恐怖行为。
    江田说，即将举行的这次大选的焦点是“安全条约”问题。他说，尽管池田政府竭力企图冲淡这一点，但是社会党仍然认为是这样。
    江田抨击日本首相池田勇人把日本人民要求实现中立说成是一种“幻想”的论调。江田指出，中立外交现在已经成为具有现实性的政策。与此相反，日本就成为“亚洲的孤儿”。
    江田谴责日本政府和自由民主党所奉行的“以联合国为中心”的政策。他指出，这个政策实际上是“以美国为主”的政策。
    江田表示，社会党要坚持自主中立的外交政策，同时要为尽速取消日本同美国的军事同盟，使日本摆脱作为美国在亚洲的“走卒”的任务，进一步为同一切国家建立友好关系而努力。
    江田接着揭露了池田政府所谓要使日本经济“高度成长”的“新政策”的欺骗性。他说，实质上这不过是要大大减少垄断资本企业的税金为垄断资本服务的反动政策。他并且指出，这种经济政策将会遭到破产。他表示，社会党要积极粉碎这项政策。
    江田最后表示，社会党要在大选中争取更多的候选人当选来打击自由民主党。江田表示，他相信只有这样才能建立完全实施日本宪法、同一切国家建立友好关系的政府。
    在这个竞选演说会上，日本社会党顾问铃木茂三郎、河上丈太郎、教育宣传部长胜间田清一都讲了话。
