Xinhua News Agency, October 10th, Elisabethville dispatch: In the vast areas of northeastern and central Katanga Province, Congo, the Baluba people, having taken up arms, continue to strike hard at the traitorous Tshombe clique.

It is reported that armed Baluba people recently launched an attack on Kabalo, an important stronghold in the northeast controlled by the Tshombe clique, and briefly occupied the Kabalo airport for three hours. According to reports, in this attack, the Baluba people punished a group of Tshombe clique "officials" and colonialists who provoked the people.

The United Nations authorities there have brutally interfered in the patriotic struggle of the people of Katanga Province. According to a United Nations spokesman in Elisabethville, two rows of "UN forces" were immediately dispatched to the scene to cooperate with Tshombe's reactionary army in a counterattack against the uprising people, and forcibly seized the Kabalo airport from them.

In the central region, the Baluba people once again attacked Bukama, Tshombe's transportation hub. It is reported that in an attack on the local airport, two Belgian military officers and two African soldiers of Tshombe's reactionary army were killed.

In the Mitwaba area in the central region, the Baluba people are concentrating in large numbers, preparing to launch an offensive against the Tshombe clique.

It is also reported that the Baluba people destroyed three hundred meters of railway track between Bukama and Kabondo-Dianda, derailing a train carrying Belgian weapons from the Kamina military base. The news said that the weapons carried by the train could arm three thousand Tshombe reactionary troops.

Under the constant blows of the people of Katanga Province, the Tshombe clique is feeling panicked. On the 8th, the traitor Tshombe wrote to Belgian Prime Minister Eyskens, requesting more support to maintain his rule. A United Nations spokesman also admitted that the situation in Katanga Province is unstable due to the increasingly active armed forces of the people.

Xinhua News Agency, October 11th, Elisabethville dispatch: The people of Katanga Province, Congo, disregarding the interference of the "UN forces" and the suppression of the Tshombe clique, are intensifying their struggle against the brutal rule of the traitorous Tshombe clique.

It is reported that on the 9th, the uprising people launched a full-scale offensive against Mitwaba in the central region from all directions, completely cutting off the city's connection with the outside world and surrounding the Tshombe reactionary army that was stubbornly resisting.

As early as the end of September, the people of the Mitwaba area took up arms to launch a patriotic struggle and fought with the police forces of the Tshombe clique in the outer strongholds of Mitwaba city. At that time, the "UN forces" immediately intervened in the people's patriotic struggle.

In Kabalo, in the northeastern region, the uprising people have been persisting in the struggle since the 6th, constantly using ambushes and attacks to severely attack the "administrative officials" and reactionary military police of the Tshombe clique, and bravely resisting the provocations of the colonialists. It is reported that in the struggle, the "administrative chief" of the Tshombe clique stationed there, a reactionary police officer and some gendarmes, as well as six colonialists were killed. The news said that under the resolute blows of the people, the colonialists there fled for their lives. On the 10th, a United Nations plane transported twenty-six colonialists to the Kamina base to escape the iron fists of the people of Kabalo.

    新华社10日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：刚果加丹加省东北部和中部的广大地区，拿起武器的巴卢巴族人继续狠狠打击冲伯卖国集团。
    据报道，武装的巴卢巴族人最近向东北部冲伯集团控制下的重要据点卡巴洛发动了进攻，并一度攻占卡巴洛机场达三小时之久。据报道，巴卢巴人在这次攻击中，惩罚了一批冲伯集团的“官员”和向人民挑衅的殖民者。
    那里的联合国当局对加丹加省人民的爱国斗争进行了横蛮的干涉。据伊利沙伯维尔一位联合国发言人透露，两排“联合国军”被立即派往出事地点，配合冲伯反动军队向起义的人民进行反扑，并且从他们手中强占了卡巴洛机场。
    在中部地区，巴卢巴人再度向冲伯的交通据点布卡马发动攻击，据报道，在一次向当地机场的进攻中，打死了冲伯反动军队的两名比籍军官和两名非洲士兵。
    在中部的米特瓦巴地区，巴卢巴人正在大量集中，准备向冲伯集团展开攻势。
    另据报道，巴卢巴人破坏了布卡马和卡崩多—迪昂达之间三百米长的铁轨，使一列来自加米纳军事基地运送比利时武器的火车出轨。消息说，这列火车运送的武器可以武装三千名冲伯反动军队。
    在加丹加省人民的不断打击下，冲伯集团感到惊惶不安，8日，叛徒冲伯已写信给比利时首相伊斯更斯，要求给予更多的支持来维持他的统治。联合国发言人也承认，由于人民武装的愈来愈活跃，加丹加省的局势不稳定。
    新华社11日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：刚果加丹加省人民不顾“联合国军”的干涉和冲伯集团的镇压，再接再厉加紧展开反对冲伯卖国集团残暴统治的斗争。
    据报道，起义的人民9日从四面八方向中部地区的米特瓦巴发动了全面的进攻，完全切断了这个城市同外界的联系，包围了进行顽抗的冲伯反动军队。
    早在9月底，米特瓦巴地区的人民就拿起武器展开爱国斗争，并在米特瓦巴城的外围据点同冲伯集团的警察部队进行搏斗。当时，“联合国军”立即出动干涉人民的爱国斗争。
    在东北部地区的卡巴洛，起义的人民自6日以来一直在坚持斗争，不断用伏击、袭击的办法狠狠打击冲伯集团的“行政官员”和反动军警，并且英勇抗击殖民者的挑衅。据报道，在斗争中，冲伯集团设在那里的“行政长官”、一个反动警官和一些宪兵以及六个殖民者被击毙。消息说，在人民坚决的打击下，那里的殖民者纷纷逃命。10日，一架联合国飞机把二十六名殖民者运往加米纳基地，以躲避卡巴洛人民的铁拳。
