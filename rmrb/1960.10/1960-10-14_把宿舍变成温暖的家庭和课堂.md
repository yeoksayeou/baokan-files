    Turn Dormitories into Warm Homes and Classrooms
    Shao Xipeng, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Committee of Jilin Yingcheng Coal Mine
    With the substantial increase in production, the number of employees in our mine has increased rapidly. At present, new workers account for more than 70% of all employees in the mine. The vast majority of them come from other places and live in single dormitories. The mine currently has twenty-six single dormitories and one single building, housing about four thousand single employees. Among them, in addition to more than seventy veteran workers and one hundred and forty cadres, the rest are new workers who joined the workforce after 1958. In the past, these dormitories were centrally managed by the mine's General Affairs Section. However, because the dormitories were distributed at various wellheads, some of which were six or seven miles apart, the General Affairs Section could not manage them, and various aspects within the dormitories were chaotic, and the workers could not rest well. Starting from the end of July, the Party Committee decided that each well would directly manage the single dormitories, implementing the hotelization of the dormitories, and the living environment of the employees was quickly improved. In particular, the Third Well created a set of scientific management methods to ensure the normal rest of the employees, while relieving some complicated labor in life and strengthening the ideological education of the workers, turning the single dormitories into warm homes and classrooms for the employees.
    The Third Well has more than two hundred and seventy single employees living in two brick and tile houses and twenty rooms of different sizes. The dormitory has one administrator and seven service personnel. The administrator is responsible for the management of all room affairs, and the service personnel are engaged in attendance calls, heating the beds, managing the drying room, depositing money and grain coupons on behalf of employees, receiving and sending letters and packages, purchasing daily necessities, cleaning indoor and outdoor hygiene, tidying luggage, and washing quilts. The number of people is not large, the service area is very wide, covering all aspects of daily life, but the work is outstanding and the results are remarkable, setting up a satisfactory big family for the employees and directly promoting production.
    Everything for the Convenience of Employees
    Starting from the convenience of employees and improving service attitude is the main characteristic of the Third Well's dormitory management work. After the Third Well took over the single dormitories, the first thing it did was to implement one-shift accommodation in the dormitories. That is, changing the past mixed accommodation of several shifts of employees into the same shift of employees living together. Employees go to work, get off work, and rest at the same time, without interfering with each other, completely reversing the past situation where people came and went in the dormitory, and no one could rest well, ensuring that employees have enough rest time, which was warmly supported by the employees.
    With the improvement of the accommodation environment, highly efficient room organizations have been established in each room. Each room has two group leaders, who are elected by the masses and led by the dormitory administrator, responsible for supervising the room personnel's attendance, cleaning, doing a good job in four preventions, and organizing cultural and political studies and other daily work. People who are usually active and responsible are elected as room leaders, and they are enthusiastic, serious, and willing to do things for everyone. Thanks to the strict dormitory organization and living system, dormitory management is convenient, so the order of the Third Well dormitory is good and orderly.
    In addition, each room has also established a room duty officer system. The room duty officer is rotated by the room residents, two people per shift, specializing in calling for attendance and urging attendance. This is a good way for the masses to manage themselves. Since the Third Well implemented this system, it has basically prevented the phenomenon of delayed attendance due to oversleeping.
    The service personnel of the Third Well dormitory are not afraid of trouble, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of dirt, and enthusiastically serve the employees, so that the employees have no worries other than work. The clothes, mining boots, socks, foot wraps, shirts and trousers worn by employees must be washed frequently, which takes a lot of time for the employees and affects their rest. The service personnel of the Third Well dormitory help the employees wash these things, and each time they wash them very clean. Some employees are embarrassed to let the service personnel wash them, so they hide the clothes they take off. The service personnel steal them to wash them, force them to wash them, and also mend the broken places after washing. Dismantling and mending quilts is a major event in summer and autumn, and it is also a troublesome thing for employees. The workers living in the Third Well do not worry about these things. As soon as the quilts are dirty, they are immediately dismantled and washed clean by the service personnel. The service personnel of the Third Well clean the employees' luggage every day, fold the quilts with edges and corners, and arrange them neatly on the bed. While wiping the tables and glass, they also wipe the employees' toothbrushes every day, and then arrange them very neatly.
    It is most convenient for employees to send letters, send and receive packages, deposit and withdraw money, and buy daily necessities in the Third Well dormitory. People who have something to do can buy things and get items by handing in their seals while sitting in the room. All of this is done by the service personnel. In the past, day shift employees did not have time to buy things, but now the service personnel help to solve everything. The service personnel also sell canteen meal tickets and exchange cloth tickets from other provinces.
    In order to avoid people taking the wrong things, the service personnel also keep money, passbooks, and cloth tickets for the residents, so that the employees can work with peace of mind.
    Turn Employee Dormitories into Ideological Education Positions
    Ideological work penetrates into the dormitories, turning the resting place into an ideological education position, and mobilizing the masses to educate themselves, is a new development in the dormitory management work of this well. It makes the employees have more opportunities to be educated, a wider range, and a faster improvement in awareness. The education methods are also adapted to local conditions and flexibly applied, so the employees are very willing to accept them. They give large lectures based on the central work and closely cooperate with wellhead activities. They carry out special education targeting the common ideological reflections of employees. The main thing is to help new workers solve ideological problems and life problems. It makes up for many inadequacies in the care at the wellhead.
    The Third Well moved the competition into the room, promoting the improvement of room management and employee thinking. The "Three Goods" competition is: "Good attendance, good cleanliness and hygiene, and good unity." The dormitory has an evaluation team, which evaluates once every ten days and makes a general evaluation once a month. The good ones are also named "Three Good Rooms" and awarded small items such as towels. The source of funds is the income from selling toothpaste skins, shoe soles, etc. picked up by the hygiene workers in the room during daily cleaning. The room competition has established the employees' sense of collective honor. Each room is afraid of falling behind, so the attendance and indoor cleanliness and hygiene work are done very well.

    把宿舍变成温暖的家庭和课堂
    中共吉林营城煤矿党委副书记　邵希鹏
    随着生产大幅度的增长，我矿的职工人数迅速增加，目前新工人已占全矿职工的70％以上。他们绝大多数来自外地，分住各独身宿舍里。全矿现有独身宿舍二十六栋，独身楼一处，住独身职工四千名左右，其中除七十多名老工人，一百四十名干部外，其余的都是1958年后参加工作的新工人。过去这些宿舍统由矿上总务科集中管理，但是因为宿舍都分布各井口，宿舍之间有的相距六、七里，总务科管不了，宿舍内各方面较乱，工人休息不好。从7月末起，党委决定由各井直接管理独身宿舍，实行宿舍旅馆化，职工们的生活环境很快得到了改善。尤其是三井，创造了一套科学管理方法，保证了职工们的正常休息，同时解除了生活上一些繁杂劳动，加强了工人思想教育，把独身宿舍变为职工温暖的家庭和课堂。
    三井有二百七十多名独身职工分住在两栋砖瓦房、大小不同的二十个房间里。宿舍有管理员一人，服务员七人。管理员负责全房间事务管理工作，服务员从事出勤叫班、烧炕、管理干燥室，代职工存款、存粮票、收发信件包裹、代买日常生活用品，室内外卫生清扫、行李整顿、被褥拆洗等。人不算多，服务面很广，包罗日常生活的全部，但工作出色，成绩显著，为职工们设置了一个称心如意的大家庭，直接推动了生产。
    一切为了职工方便
    一切从方便职工出发，从改善服务态度着手，是这个井宿舍管理工作主要的特色。三井接管独身宿舍以后，第一件工作是在宿舍推行一班化住宿。就是把过去几班职工混杂住宿，改为同班职工一起住宿。职工们同时上班、下班、休息，互不干扰，彻底扭转了过去宿舍里你来他去，谁也休息不好的情况，保证了职工们有足够的休息时间，受到职工们热烈拥护。
    随着住宿环境的改善，在各房间里都建立了效率较高的房间组织。每个房间设两名组长，组长由群众选举产生，受宿舍管理员领导，负责督促房间人员出勤、打扫卫生、作好四防和组织文化、政治学习等日常工作。平时积极负责的人都被选为房间组长，他们热情认真，肯为大家办事。由于有了严密的宿舍组织和生活制度，宿舍管理就方便了，所以三井宿舍秩序好，有条不紊。
    此外，各个房间里还都建立了房间值班员制度。房间值班员由房间住宿人员轮流担任，每班两个人，专门负责叫班督促出勤。这是群众自己管理自己的好办法。三井从实行这个制度以来，基本防止了因睡过头觉而耽误出勤的现象。
    三井宿舍的服务员不怕麻烦，不怕劳苦，不嫌脏，热心为职工服务，让职工除工作外无任何后顾之忧。职工穿的衣服、下井靴子、袜子、包脚布、衬衣衬裤等，必须经常洗，职工们为此花费很多时间，影响休息。三井宿舍服务员就帮助职工洗这些东西，每次都洗得很干净。有的职工不好意思让服务员洗，把脱下的东西藏起来。服务员就偷着洗，逼着洗，洗完后还把坏的地方给补上。拆补被褥是夏秋的大事，又是职工的麻烦事。住在三井的工人就不担心这些事，被褥一脏马上就被服务员拆洗干净。三井服务员每天把职工的行李清扫一遍，把被褥叠得有棱有角，在床上摆得整整齐齐。在擦桌子、玻璃的同时，每天还把职工们的牙具等都擦一遍，然后很规矩的摆列起来。
    职工们送信、寄取包裹、存款取款、买日用物品，在三井宿舍是最方便的。有事的人只要把印章一交，坐在屋里就可以买到东西，取到物品。这一切都由服务员担任。过去白班职工没有时间买东西，现在服务员什么都帮助给解决了。服务员还代卖食堂饭票、兑换外省布票等。
    为了避免人多拿错东西，服务员还为住宿职工保管金钱、存折、布票，使职工们安心生产。
    把职工宿舍变成思想教育阵地
    思想工作深入到宿舍，把休息场所变为思想教育阵地，发动群众自己教育自己，是这个井宿舍管理工作的一个新发展。它使职工们受教育的机会更多了，面更广了，觉悟提高得更快了。教育方法也是因地制宜、灵活运用的，所以职工很乐意接受。他们根据中心工作讲大课，紧紧配合井口活动。针对职工们共同性的思想反映，进行专门教育。主要是帮助新工人解决思想问题和生活问题。弥补了很多在井口照顾不周的地方。
    三井把竞赛搬到房间里，推动了房间管理和职工思想的提高。“三好”竞赛是：“出勤好、清洁卫生好、团结好”。宿舍设有评比小组，每旬评比一次，每月总评一次，好的还命名为“三好房间”，还奖给点毛巾等小物品。资金来源是由卫生员每日清扫时在房间里拣出来牙膏皮、鞋底等出卖所得收入。房间竞赛树立了职工们的集体荣誉感，每个房间都怕落后，所以出勤、室内清洁卫生工作都搞得很出色。
