Liaoning Actively Prepares Canteens for Winter

Rural canteens in Liaoning are seizing the time to gather firewood and dry vegetables, actively preparing for the winter.

Liaoning's climate is severely cold, and the primary problem for rural canteens in winter is heating. Many canteens have renovated dining halls, built heated walls and heated platforms, and stored enough firewood. In Chang'an Commune, Changpao Brigade, Andong County, more than 100 heated platforms and heated walls have been built to ensure that members have warm rooms to eat in and warm platforms to sleep on.

Bringing Back All Seeds, Leaves, Stalks, and Roots of Crops

The Gucheng Brigade of the Cuiqiao Commune in Fugou, Henan, has strengthened leadership, skillfully utilized labor, and adapted to local conditions and crops, bringing back all seeds, leaves, stalks, and roots of early autumn crops. Although the autumn harvest task for this brigade has increased this year, the harvesting work is being carried out in an orderly manner. The roots and leaves of the harvested autumn crops have all been transported back without occupying special personnel. The brigade has transported back 137,000 jin of soybean and mung bean leaves alone, which is a good batch of pig feed. In addition, nearly 60,000 jin of various autumn crop roots have been recovered, increasing a large amount of firewood.

Sichuan Seizes the Opportunity to Plant Winter Vegetables on a Large Scale

On the basis of significant achievements in autumn vegetable production, Sichuan is seizing the current favorable opportunity to widely mobilize the masses to plant winter vegetables on a large scale.

Winter vegetable production occupies an important position in Sichuan's annual vegetable production. It not only has many varieties and high yields, but also a long harvest and consumption season. Fresh vegetables can generally be eaten until April or May next year, connecting with spring vegetables. Therefore, all parts of the province have attached importance to this production early on.

Qinghai Hastens to Harvest Potatoes

After the spring wheat and highland barley harvesting and threshing were basically completed in Qinghai Province, labor was immediately properly arranged to rush to harvest potatoes (i.e., potatoes). At present, the potato harvesting area has accounted for more than 20% of the total planting area. In the northwestern grassland area, where frost comes earlier, many communes have finished harvesting potatoes before the frost; in the warmer southeastern area, in order to strive for more harvests and allow potatoes to extend their growing period appropriately, comprehensive harvesting has only recently begun.

Beijing Suburbs Launch "Small Autumn Harvest" Campaign

While planting wheat on a large scale and rushing to harvest major autumn crops, the suburbs of Beijing are actively launching a "small autumn harvest" campaign. The amount of medicinal materials, wild fiber raw materials, and oil crops purchased in September increased by more than double compared with the same period last year. This year's "small autumn harvest" in Beijing is being carried out under careful investigation and proper arrangements. Before the start of the "small autumn harvest," all regions conducted a general survey of wild resources.

    要闻快报
    辽宁积极准备食堂过冬
    辽宁各地农村食堂，抓紧时间打柴晒菜，积极做好过冬准备。
    辽宁气候严寒，农村食堂过冬首先要解决的是取暖问题。许多食堂整修了饭厅，搭了火墙火炕，贮备了足够的柴草。安东县长安公社长泡大队已修火炕、火墙一百多处，保证社员吃饭有暖屋，睡觉有暖炕。
    把庄稼籽叶秆根都收回
    河南扶沟崔桥公社古城大队，加强领导，巧用劳动力，因地因作物制宜，早秋作物的籽、叶、秆、根已全部收回。今年这个队的秋收任务虽然加大，但收获工作却搞得有条不紊。已收完的秋作物的根、叶，没有占用专人，都运了回来。全队光大豆、绿豆叶子就已运回十三万七千斤，这是一批很好的猪饲料。此外还收回各种秋作物根近六万斤，增加了大批烧柴。
    四川抓时机大种冬季蔬菜
    四川各地在秋菜生产取得显著成绩的基础上，又抓紧当前有利时机，广泛发动群众大种冬菜。
    冬菜生产在四川全年的蔬菜生产中，占有重要地位。它不仅品种多，产量高，同时收获食用的季节也较长，鲜菜一般可吃到明年四、五月，接上春菜。因此，全省各地都及早重视了这项生产。
    青海各地抢收马铃薯
    青海省在春小麦和青稞收割打碾基本结束以后，立即妥善安排劳力抢收洋芋（即马铃薯），目前洋芋收获面积已占种植总面积的百分之二十以上。降霜较早的西北部草原地带，许多公社已经抢在霜冻前收完洋芋；东南部较暖地区，为了力争多收，让洋芋适当延长生长期，最近才开始全面收获。
    北京郊区开展“小秋收”运动
    北京郊区在大种小麦、抢收大秋作物的同时，积极开展“小秋收”运动。九月份收购的药材、野生纤维原料、油料等产品，比去年同期增加了一倍多。北京今年的“小秋收”是在周密调查、妥善安排下进行的。在“小秋收”开始前，各地区普查了野生资源。
