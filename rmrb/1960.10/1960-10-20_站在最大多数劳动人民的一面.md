Standing on the Side of the Vast Majority of the Working People
Zhang Desheng

I.

The fourth volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" has been published. The works of Comrade Mao Zedong collected in this volume are a record of the victory and a summary of the experience of China's Third Revolutionary Civil War, and a great achievement and outstanding contribution of Comrade Mao Zedong in applying the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism to solve the problems of the Chinese revolution. The publication of the fourth volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" has great theoretical and practical significance for our country's revolutionary and construction undertakings.

Standing on the side of the vast majority of the working people is a basic guiding ideology of Comrade Mao Zedong on the Chinese revolution, and also the fundamental stand of Marxists-Leninists. Comrade Mao Zedong often used this idea to educate us. Whether during the rapid advance of the revolutionary cause or when encountering temporary difficulties, he always earnestly admonished us never to forget this idea. In September 1947, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was suffering from the so-called "key offensive" of the US-Chiang reactionaries, and the enemy army occupied almost all the county towns in the border region. At that time, the seat of the CPC Central Committee—Jiaxian County—was carrying out land reform to support the revolutionary war. The situation was very difficult. It was at this time that Comrade Mao Zedong wrote the inscription "Standing on the side of the vast majority of the working people" for the Jiaxian County Committee of the CPC. This inscription, along with many instructions from Comrade Mao Zedong at that time, profoundly educated us, strengthened our revolutionary stand, and enabled us to overcome difficulties and defeat the enemy with full confidence.

Standing on the side of the vast majority of the working people is a consistent thought of Comrade Mao Zedong. This was the case during the period of democratic revolution, and it is also the case during the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction; this is the case in dealing with domestic issues, and it is also the case in dealing with international issues. During the period of democratic revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly criticized the right-leaning opportunist view of daring not to boldly mobilize the masses and not daring to wage tit-for-tat struggles against the enemy in the face of the enemy's offensive. He insisted on relying on the working masses and uniting all forces that could be united to defeat the counter-revolutionary war of the reactionaries with the people's revolutionary war, and finally achieved the great victory of the democratic revolution. During the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, on the issues of agricultural cooperation and people's communes, Comrade Mao Zedong severely criticized the right-leaning opportunist view of standing on the position of a few wealthy peasants, criticizing that cooperation was too hasty and too fast, and that communization was done too early and too badly. He resolutely stood on the side of the working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants who constituted the majority of the rural population, insisted on pushing the socialist revolution to a climax and carrying it through to the end, thereby rapidly realizing agricultural cooperation in 1956, and further realizing people's communes in 1958, and enabling the people's communes to embark on the road of consolidation and sound development. On the issue of socialist construction, Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly criticized the right-leaning opportunist view of underestimating the strength of the people and adopting the method of "less, slower, worse, and more costly" for construction. He resolutely represented the urgent desire of the broad working people to rapidly change the "poor and blank" face of the country, proposed and insisted on the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," and a whole series of policies of "walking on two legs," thereby creating a new situation of an all-round, continuous, and great leap forward in socialist construction. On the issue of the struggle for world peace, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: The imperialist bloc headed by the United States is preparing for war, and the crisis of war exists, but "the democratic forces of the world's people outweigh the reactionary forces, and are developing forward."① "The people are the determining factor. Relying on the unity and struggle of the people, they will surely be able to defeat imperialism and their running dogs, and achieve lasting world peace."② This idea of Comrade Mao Zedong has extremely realistic guiding significance and great vitality for our struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and in defense of lasting world peace.

II.

Standing on the side of the vast majority of the working people means being infinitely loyal in representing the interests of the vast majority of the working people. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Our responsibility is to be responsible to the people. Every word, every action, and every policy must be in accordance with the interests of the people."③ After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Party represented the wishes of the people of the whole country. On the one hand, we did our best to strive for peace and oppose civil war; on the other hand, we maintained a high degree of vigilance against Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy of fake peace and real civil war, made full preparations, and resolutely defended the fruits of the people's revolutionary struggle. When the US-Chiang reactionaries launched an all-out civil war, concentrating millions of American-equipped reactionary troops to invade the liberated areas on a large scale, our Party was not frightened by the apparent strength of the enemy, but resolutely represented the interests of the people and opposed the counter-revolutionary war with revolutionary war. When the US-Chiang reactionaries were on the verge of total collapse and implemented the delaying tactic of pretending to seek peace, our Party was not confused by those sweet-talking enemies, but for the sake of the people of the whole country, continued to wage a tit-for-tat struggle against the enemy, carrying the revolution through to the end.

Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that we must persevere in the struggle to safeguard the interests of the vast majority of the working people. He said: "If the people want liberation, they entrust power to those who can represent them and who can faithfully serve them, and that is us Communists. When we become representatives of the people, we must represent them well. Don't be like Chen Duxiu. Chen Duxiu did not adopt a tit-for-tat, inch-by-inch struggle against the counter-revolutionary attack on the people, and as a result, in a few months of 1927, he lost all the rights that the people had gained. This time we must pay attention." "Chiang Kai-shek seizes every inch of power and every bit of profit from the people. What about us? Our policy is to fight tit-for-tat, to fight for every inch of land."④ Infinitely loyal to representing the interests of the vast majority of the working people and waging a tit-for-tat struggle against the enemies of the people is Comrade Mao Zedong's most firm and thorough proletarian revolutionary spirit and revolutionary line. During the Third Revolutionary Civil War, our Party always adhered to Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line, resolutely represented the interests of the people, and resolutely opposed the enemies of the people, and finally achieved the complete victory of the people's great revolution.

The idea of daring to struggle and daring to win for the interests of the people will always be our guiding ideology. At present, although our country's socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory, the socialist revolution and socialist construction have not yet been completed. The greatest interest of our working people is to carry the socialist revolution through to the end, accelerate the building of a socialist society, and gradually transition to a complete, mature, and infinitely happy communist society in the future. Marxist-Leninists who are loyal to the interests of the people must never be satisfied with the status quo and stop moving forward; they must never want only socialism and not communism; they must never "sacrifice fundamental interests for the sake of temporary and partial interests."⑤ We must, according to the principles of the Marxist-Leninist theory of continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages, resolutely carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and at the same time, in carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, actively and step-by-step foster communist factors and prepare conditions for the future realization of communism.

III.

Representing the interests of the vast majority of the working people is a starting point. To realize the interests of the working people, it is also necessary to believe that the majority of the working people liberate themselves, and it is also necessary to rely on the conscious revolutionary actions of the majority of the working people.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The basic principle of Marxism-Leninism is to make the masses realize their own interests and unite to fight for their own interests."⑥ Starting from this basic point of view, as early as the eve of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: In order to build an independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous New China, it is necessary to adopt the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses and strengthening the people's forces.

Should we rely on the revolutionary struggle of the masses to establish a New China, or should we rely on peaceful negotiations? After Japan surrendered, some people still had a vague understanding of this. Comrade Mao Zedong clearly answered this question. On the one hand, Comrade Mao Zedong explained the necessity of conducting peaceful negotiations; on the other hand, he clearly pointed out that we must maintain a high degree of vigilance, adhere to the people's struggle and the people's armed forces, never rely on negotiations, never hope that the Kuomintang reactionaries will have good intentions, and resolutely rely on the people and the strength in the hands of the people. Subsequent facts proved that the victory of the Chinese revolution and the establishment of New China were the result of the revolutionary struggle of the broad masses of the people; they were not bestowed by the ruling class, but were obtained by the bloodshed and sacrifice of the people.

Should we rely on the conscious actions of the masses to carry out land reform, or should we rely on the replacement by cadres? At that time, some comrades in the Party had a vague understanding. Comrade Mao Zedong clarified these understandings in a timely manner. He said: "We have always advocated that revolution should rely on the people's masses, everyone should do it, and oppose relying only on a few people to issue orders."⑦ Facts proved that in places where everyone relied on the masses to do it, the land reform was carried out thoroughly and healthily; in places where only a few cadres issued orders and took over, right or "left" deviations occurred in the land reform.

In the revolutionary war and land reform, who to rely on and who to unite with was also a controversial issue. Comrade Mao Zedong correctly resolved this issue. On the one hand, he criticized the "left" closed-doorist tendency and clearly pointed out: "The slogan 'Poor and hired peasants fight the country and sit in the country' is wrong. In the countryside, it is hired peasants, poor peasants, middle peasants, and other working people who unite together, under the leadership of the Communist Party, to fight the country and sit in the country, not just poor and hired peasants who fight the country and sit in the country. In the whole country, it is workers, peasants (including new rich peasants), independent industrialists and businessmen, small and medium capitalists who are oppressed and harmed by reactionary forces, students, teachers, professors, general intellectuals, self-employed people, enlightened gentry, general civil servants, oppressed ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese who unite together, under the leadership of the working class (through the Communist Party), to fight the country and sit in the country, not just a few people who fight the country and sit in the country."⑧ On the other hand, he also criticized the right opportunist view and adhered to the proletarian class line. He said: "In the urban struggle, who do we rely on? Some confused comrades think that it is not the working class, but the poor masses. Some even more confused comrades think that it is the bourgeoisie... We must criticize these confused ideas. We must wholeheartedly rely on the working class."⑨ He also said: "The basic force that land reform relies on can only and must be the poor peasants. This poor peasant class, together with the hired peasants, accounts for about 70% of China's rural population. The main and direct task of land reform is to satisfy the demands of the poor and hired peasant masses."⑩ These instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong guided us to resolutely rely on the most revolutionary urban and rural proletariat and semi-proletariat, united all forces that could be united, and promoted the victory of the people's great revolution.

The policy of boldly mobilizing the masses and strengthening the people's forces is applicable to the period of democratic revolution, and also applicable to the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction; it is applicable to domestic revolution and construction, and also applicable to the struggle to defend world peace. The Party's general line for socialist construction and a whole set of policies of "walking on two legs" are precisely for the purpose of most fully mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the people and carrying out socialist construction at a high speed. However, on this issue, some people still hold different views. For example, in socialist construction, some people advocate the expert line and oppose the mass line; some people are not good at consulting with the masses and are accustomed to relying only on orders to do things. In the socialist transformation of agriculture and rural construction, some people have feelings for the rich middle peasants and lack feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants, and cannot steadfastly establish and consolidate the leading advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants. On international issues, defending world peace also requires the widespread development of the revolutionary struggle of the masses, the strengthening of the forces for peace, democracy, and independence, the strengthening of the socialist forces, and the weakening of the forces of imperialism and all reactionaries. In the struggle for lasting world peace, talks between leaders of various countries are necessary, but if we only one-sidedly emphasize talks between leaders and ignore the revolutionary struggle of the masses, and dare not actively support the national liberation movements and proletarian revolutionary movements of various countries, this is wrong. All the above-mentioned erroneous understandings, although different in nature and degree, have one thing in common, that is, they do not believe or do not fully believe in the power of the people. These people have forgotten the basic principle of historical materialism that "the working people create history." They do not understand that in socialist construction, the decisive role is played by the working people of the whole country. In the socialist transformation of agriculture and rural construction, the decisive role is played by the poor and lower-middle peasants who constitute the majority of the rural population. In the movement to defend world peace, the decisive role is played by the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world. Therefore, all true Marxists-Leninists must thoroughly overcome the bureaucratic and commandist style of work of being divorced from the masses, must resolutely oppose the right opportunist view of underestimating the power of the people and neglecting the struggle of the masses, firmly believe in the majority of the working people, firmly rely on the majority of the working people, and unswervingly push forward the socialist revolution and socialist construction as well as the struggle to defend world peace.

IV.

China's peasants account for 80% of the total population. On a national scale, the so-called uniting the majority mainly means uniting the peasants. If China's working class and its vanguard do not first focus on the liberation of the peasants, they will certainly not be able to achieve their own complete liberation; if they do not understand the thoughts and emotions of the peasants, are not good at uniting and leading the peasants, they will certainly commit "left" or right errors. Precisely because of this, Comrade Mao Zedong has always believed that the peasant question is the basic question of the Chinese revolution; the peasant's strength is the main force of the Chinese revolution. Our country's democratic revolution was victorious by encircling the cities from the countryside. The armed struggle led by our Party was a peasant war under the leadership of the proletariat. The revolutionary army led by our Party was the peasants dressed in military uniforms. Our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong resolutely supported the revolutionary demands of the broad masses of peasants, grasping both the revolutionary war and land reform. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "The thorough reform of the land system is a basic task of the Chinese revolution at the present stage. If we can universally and thoroughly solve the land problem, we will obtain the most basic conditions sufficient to defeat all enemies."? Facts proved that as a result of the implementation of land reform, the revolutionary enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of peasants was fully mobilized, enthusiastically joining the People's Liberation Army and supporting the People's Liberation Army, giving our revolutionary war the broadest and most solid mass base, and rapidly achieving victory on a national scale.

The peasant question is a fundamental question in our country's democratic revolution, and it is also a fundamental question in our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. The high tide of our country's socialist transformation was caused by the high tide of agricultural cooperation; the great leap forward of our country's industry and other economic undertakings started from the great leap forward of agriculture. Precisely because of this, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly emphasized the idea that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and grain is the foundation of the foundation. Since this year, they have also issued instructions to run agriculture on a large scale, run grain on a large scale, and run people's communes well, and accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture. Implementing these instructions will surely advance our country's worker-peasant alliance to a new stage.

Our emphasis on the peasant question does not mean that we can neglect the leadership of the working class, nor does it mean that we can relax the education and transformation of the peasants. On the contrary, adhering to the revolutionary leadership of the working class and adhering to the education and transformation of the peasants are also consistent thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. Because only the working class is the most far-sighted, selfless, and most thoroughly revolutionary."? Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out that the working class must have two conditions to realize its leadership: "(A) Lead the led (allies) to wage a resolute struggle against the common enemy and achieve victory; (B) Provide material benefits to the led, at least without harming their interests, and at the same time give political education to the led."? Our Party's work is precisely done according to these instructions. When we say that we satisfy the interests of the peasants, we start from the fundamental interests of the peasants—realizing socialism and communism—not from accommodating the narrow interests of the peasants. When we say that we believe in the peasants and unite the peasants, we believe that the peasants can consciously take the road of socialism and communism under the leadership of the working class, not that the peasants can spontaneously take the road of socialism and communism. While emphasizing that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, we give full play to the leading role of industry and unswervingly use modern industry to transform agriculture and arm agriculture; we do not let go of industry while grasping agriculture. While we care about the material interests of the peasants, we tirelessly strengthen the political education of the peasants and put political education in the primary position. In short, taking the working class as the leadership and the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation is a complete and inseparable policy. In the past, we comprehensively implemented this policy, and in the future, we will continue to comprehensively adhere to this policy. Taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, combining the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture is also a complete and inseparable policy. In the past, we comprehensively implemented this policy, and in the future, we will continue to comprehensively adhere to this policy.

V.

Whether or not one can "stand on the side of the vast majority of the working people" is a question of world outlook, and it is a fundamental difference between Marxism-Leninism and right opportunism. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Making trouble, failing, making trouble again, failing again, until extinction—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause, and they will never violate this logic. This is a Marxist law... Struggling, failing, struggling again, failing again, struggling again, until victory—this is the logic of the people, and they will never violate this logic either. This is another Marxist law... Class struggle, some classes are victorious, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is thousands of years of civilization history. Explaining history from this point of view is called historical materialism, and standing on the opposite side of this point of view is historical idealism."? This is exactly the case. Class contradictions are irreconcilable. Thousands of years of human civilization history is a history of class struggle. In the class struggle, no matter what tortuous roads it goes through, the people will inevitably win, the reactionary class will inevitably perish, the people are the creators of history, and the development of history is determined by the people's struggle for production and class struggle. This is the historical materialist world outlook. In contrast to this is the historical idealist world outlook. Marxists believe that it is necessary to firmly stand on the side of the working people, represent the interests of the working people, boldly mobilize the masses, firmly rely on the masses, and carry out a true and thorough people's revolution. The right opportunists, under the control of the historical idealist world outlook, stand on the side of the bourgeoisie, do not believe in the working people, and dare not boldly mobilize the working people to carry out a true and thorough people's revolution. We must resolutely oppose the bourgeois historical idealist world outlook, establish and consolidate the proletarian historical materialist world outlook, and always stand on the side of the vast majority of the working people. Only in this way can we fundamentally draw a line with right opportunist ideas and be a true Marxist-Leninist.

The basic way to transform the world outlook is to combine study, criticism, and practice. That is to say: we must conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works; we must constantly criticize bourgeois ideology, especially modern revisionist ideology; we must go deep into reality, deep into the masses, and strengthen labor training and the training of actual struggle. At present, it is particularly important to seize the study of the fourth volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The publication of the fourth volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" provides us with a powerful ideological weapon for transforming our world outlook. We should conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's great Marxist-Leninist theoretical works. We should study Comrade Mao Zedong's most firm and thorough revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win for the interests of the working people; we should study Comrade Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary stand of resolutely relying on the majority of the working people and boldly mobilizing the majority of the working people; we should study Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought of attaching importance to the peasant question and tirelessly consolidating and developing the worker-peasant alliance, and always stand on the side of the vast majority of the working people.

The victory of our country's revolutionary cause and construction cause is the victory of Marxism-Leninism, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought which combines the universal principles of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. Marxism-Leninism and Comrade Mao Zedong's works are powerful ideological weapons for guiding our various undertakings from victory to victory. We clearly know that there will still be various obstacles and difficulties on our road forward. However, as long as we can grasp the science of Marxism-Leninism, strive to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and always stand on the side of the vast majority of the working people, we are fully capable of overcoming any obstacles and defeating any difficulties. No force can stop us from moving forward.

    站在最大多数劳动人民的一面
    张德生
    一
    《毛泽东选集》第四卷出版了。收集在这一卷中的毛泽东同志的著作，是我国第三次国内革命战争的胜利记录和经验总结，是毛泽东同志应用马克思列宁主义的科学理论解决中国革命问题的伟大成果和杰出贡献。《毛泽东选集》第四卷的出版，对于我国的革命事业和建设事业，具有极大的理论意义和实践意义。
    站在最大多数劳动人民的一面，是毛泽东同志关于中国革命的一个基本的指导思想，也是马克思列宁主义者的根本立场。毛泽东同志经常用这个思想来教育我们，无论是在革命事业飞跃前进或者遇到暂时困难的时候，他都谆谆告诫我们永远不要忘记这个思想。1947年9月，陕甘宁边区正遭受到美蒋反动派的所谓“重点进攻”，敌军侵占了边区几乎所有的县城。当时，中共中央所在地——葭县，正在进行土地改革，支援革命战争。情况是很困难的。就在这个时候，毛泽东同志把“站在最大多数劳动人民的一面”，作为给中共葭县县委的题字。这个题字，和毛泽东同志当时的许多指示，深刻地教育了我们，使我们坚定了革命立场，满怀信心地克服了困难、战胜了敌人。
    站在最大多数劳动人民的一面，这是毛泽东同志一贯的思想。在民主革命时期是如此，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期也是如此；对待国内问题是如此，对待国际问题也是如此。在民主革命时期，毛泽东同志多次批判了那种在敌人的进攻面前，不敢放手发动群众、不敢同敌人进行针锋相对的斗争的右倾机会主义观点，坚持依靠劳动群众，团结一切可能团结的力量，以人民革命战争战胜反动派的反革命战争，终于取得了民主革命的伟大胜利。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，在农业合作化和人民公社化的问题上，毛泽东同志严肃批判了那种站在少数富裕农民的立场上，指责合作化太急了、太快了，公社化办早了、办糟了的右倾机会主义观点，坚决站在工人阶级和占农村人口大多数的贫农、下中农的一面，坚持把社会主义革命推向高潮、进行到底，从而在1956年迅速实现了农业合作化，在1958年进一步实现了人民公社化，并使人民公社走上了巩固和健全发展的道路。在社会主义建设的问题上，毛泽东同志反复批判了那种低估人民力量，采用少、慢、差、费办法进行建设的右倾机会主义观点，坚决代表了广大劳动人民迅速改变“一穷二白”面貌的迫切愿望，提出了并且坚持了“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，从而开创了社会主义建设全面持续大跃进的崭新局面。在争取世界和平斗争的问题上，毛泽东同志指出：以美国为首的帝国主义集团，正在准备战争，战争的危机是存在的，但是，“世界人民的民主力量超过反动力量，并且正在向前发展。”①“人民是决定的因素，依靠人民的团结和斗争，必能战胜帝国主义和他们的走狗，取得世界的持久和平。”②毛泽东同志的这个思想，对于我们反对以美国为首的帝国主义、保卫世界持久和平的斗争，具有极其现实的指导意义和伟大的生命力。
    二
    站在最大多数劳动人民的一面，就是要无限忠实地代表最大多数劳动人民的利益。毛泽东同志说：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益。”③在抗日战争结束以后，我们党代表全国人民的愿望，一方面尽力争取和平，反对内战；另一方面对于蒋介石假和平、真内战的阴谋保持了高度的警惕，进行了充分的准备，坚决保卫人民的革命斗争果实。当美蒋反动派全面发动内战，集中几百万美式装备的反动军队向解放区大举进犯的时候，我们党没有被敌人的表面强大所吓倒，而是坚决地代表人民的利益，以革命战争来反对反革命的战争。当美蒋反动派临近全面崩溃，实行伪装求和的缓兵之计的时候，我们党也没有被那些口蜜腹剑的敌人所迷惑，而是为了全国人民的利益，继续同敌人进行针锋相对的斗争，将革命进行到底。
    毛泽东同志教导我们：必须坚持不懈地为维护最大多数劳动人民的利益而斗争。他说：“人民要解放，就把权力委托给能够代表他们的、能够忠实为他们办事的人，这就是我们共产党人。我们当了人民的代表，必须代表得好，不要像陈独秀。陈独秀对于反革命向人民的进攻，不是采取针锋相对、寸土必争的方针，结果在1927年的几个月内，把人民已经取得的权利统统丧失干净。这一次我们就要注意。”“蒋介石对于人民是寸权必夺，寸利必得。我们呢？我们的方针是针锋相对，寸土必争。”④无限忠实地代表最大多数劳动人民的利益，同人民的敌人进行针锋相对的斗争，这是毛泽东同志的最坚定、最彻底的无产阶级的革命精神和革命路线。在第三次国内革命战争时期，我们党始终坚持了毛泽东同志的这条马克思列宁主义的革命路线，坚决代表人民的利益，坚决反对人民的敌人，终于取得了人民大革命的彻底胜利。
    为了人民的利益敢于斗争、敢于胜利的思想，永远是我们的指导思想。目前，我国的社会主义革命虽然取得了决定性的胜利，但是，社会主义革命和社会主义建设还没有完成。我国劳动人民的最大利益，是要把社会主义革命进行到底，加速建成社会主义社会，并在将来逐步过渡到完全的、成熟的、无限幸福的共产主义社会。忠实于人民利益的马克思列宁主义者，决不能满足现状，停滞不前；决不能只要社会主义，不要共产主义；决不能“牺牲根本的利益，贪图暂时的局部的利益。”⑤我们必须根据马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的原理，坚决地把社会主义革命进行到底，并且在进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的时候，积极而又有步骤地扶植共产主义的因素，为将来实现共产主义准备条件。
    三
    代表最大多数劳动人民的利益，这是一个出发点，要使劳动人民的利益得到实现，还需要相信大多数劳动人民自己解放自己，还需要依靠大多数劳动人民自觉的革命行动。
    毛泽东同志说：“马克思列宁主义的基本原则，就是要使群众认识自己的利益，并且团结起来，为自己的利益而奋斗。”⑥从这个基本观点出发，早在抗日战争胜利的前夕，毛泽东同志就指出：为着建设一个独立的、自由的、民主的、统一的、富强的新中国，必须采取放手发动群众，壮大人民力量的方针。
    建立新中国，依靠群众的革命斗争，还是依靠和平谈判？这在日本投降以后，一部分人还有模糊认识。毛泽东同志明确地解答了这个问题。毛泽东同志一方面说明了进行和平谈判的必要；另一方面，又明确指出：必须保持高度警惕，坚持人民的斗争和人民的武装，绝对不要依靠谈判，绝对不要希望国民党反动派发善心，要坚决依靠人民，依靠人民手里的力量。以后的事实证明：中国革命的胜利，新中国的建立，正是依靠广大群众革命斗争的结果；不是统治阶级恩赐的，而是人民群众流血牺牲所取得的。
    进行土地改革，依靠群众的自觉行动，还是依靠干部的包办代替？在当时，党内有一部分同志存在着模糊认识。毛泽东同志及时地澄清了这些认识。他说：“我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手，反对只依靠少数人发号施令。”⑦事实证明：凡是依靠群众大家动手的地方，土地改革就进行得很彻底、很健康；凡是只靠少数干部发号施令包办代替的地方，土地改革中就发生了右的或“左”的偏向。
    在革命战争和土地改革中，依靠什么人，团结什么人，这也是一个有争论的问题。毛泽东同志正确地解决了这个问题。一方面他批判了“左”的关门主义倾向，明确指出：“‘贫雇农打江山坐江山’的口号是错误的。在乡村，是雇农、贫农、中农和其他劳动人民联合一道，在共产党领导之下打江山坐江山，而不是单独贫雇农打江山坐江山。在全国，是工人，农民（包括新富农），独立工商业者，被反动势力所压迫和损害的中小资本家，学生、教员、教授、一般知识分子，自由职业者，开明绅士，一般公务人员，被压迫的少数民族和海外华侨，联合一道，在工人阶级（经过共产党）的领导之下，打江山坐江山，而不是少数人打江山坐江山。”⑧另一方面，他也批判了右的机会主义观点，坚持了无产阶级的阶级路线，他说：“在城市斗争中，我们依靠谁呢？有些糊涂的同志认为不是依靠工人阶级，而是依靠贫民群众。有些更糊涂的同志认为是依靠资产阶级。……我们必须批判这些糊涂思想。我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”。⑨他又说：“土地改革所依靠的基本力量，只能和必须是贫农。这个贫农阶层，和雇农在一起，占了中国农村人口的70％左右。土地改革的主要的和直接的任务，就是满足贫雇农群众的要求。”⑩毛泽东同志的这些指示，引导我们坚决依靠最富于革命性的城乡无产阶级和半无产阶级，团结了一切可能团结的力量，促进了人民大革命的胜利。
    放手发动群众，壮大人民力量的方针，适用于民主革命时期，也适用于社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期；适用于国内的革命和建设，也适用于保卫世界和平的斗争。党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，正是为了最充分地调动人民群众的积极性和创造性，高速度地进行社会主义建设。但是，在这个问题上，有些人还持有不同的看法。例如，在社会主义建设中，有些人主张专家路线，反对群众路线；有些人不善于同群众商量，习惯于只靠命令办事。在农业的社会主义改造和农村建设中，有些人对富裕中农有感情，对贫农、下中农缺少感情，不能坚定不移地树立和巩固贫农、下中农的领导优势。在国际问题上，保卫世界和平，也需要广泛地发展群众的革命斗争，壮大争取和平、民主、独立的力量，壮大社会主义的力量，削弱帝国主义和一切反动派的力量。在争取世界持久和平的斗争中，各国领导人的会谈是需要的，但是，如果只片面强调领导人的会谈，而忽视群众的革命斗争，不敢积极地支持各国民族解放运动和各国无产阶级革命运动，这就是错误的。所有以上这些错误的认识，尽管性质和程度有所不同，但是有一个共同之点，就是不相信或者不完全相信人民的力量。这些人忘掉了“劳动人民创造历史”这个历史唯物主义的基本原理。他们不了解，在社会主义建设中，起决定作用的，是全国的劳动人民。在农业的社会主义改造和农村建设中，起决定作用的，是占农村人口大多数的贫农和下中农。在保卫世界和平运动中，起决定作用的，是全世界人民的革命斗争。因此，一切真正的马克思列宁主义者，必须彻底克服脱离群众的官僚主义和命令主义作风，必须坚决反对低估人民力量、忽视群众斗争的右倾机会主义观点，坚定地相信大多数劳动人民，坚定地依靠大多数劳动人民，毫不动摇地把社会主义革命和社会主义建设以及保卫世界和平的斗争推向前进。

    中国的农民占全人口80％，就全国范围来说，所谓团结大多数，主要的就是团结农民。中国的工人阶级和他的先锋队，如果不首先着眼于农民的解放，就一定不能实现自己的彻底解放；如果不懂得农民的思想情绪，不善于团结农民和领导农民，就一定会犯“左”的或右的错误。正因为如此，毛泽东同志一贯认为，农民问题是中国革命的基本问题；农民的力量，是中国革命的主要力量。我国的民主革命是以农村包围城市而取得胜利的。我们党所领导的武装斗争，就是在无产阶级领导下的农民战争。我们党所领导的革命军队，就是穿上军装的农民。我们党和毛泽东同志坚决支持广大农民的革命要求，一手抓革命战争，一手抓土地改革。毛泽东同志曾经指出：“土地制度的彻底改革，是现阶段中国革命的一项基本任务。如果我们能够普遍地彻底地解决土地问题，我们就获得了足以战胜一切敌人的最基本的条件。”?事实证明：实行土地改革的结果，几万万农民的革命积极性被充分地发动起来，踊跃地参加人民解放军，支援人民解放军，使我们的革命战争有了最广泛、最牢固的群众基础，迅速取得了全国范围的胜利。
    农民问题是我国民主革命中的根本问题，也是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的根本问题。我国的社会主义改造高潮，是由农业合作化的高潮所引起的；我国工业和其他经济事业的大跃进，是从农业的大跃进开始的。正因为如此，党中央和毛泽东同志反复强调农业是国民经济的基础、粮食是基础的基础的思想。今年以来，又作出了大办农业、大办粮食和办好人民公社、加速农业技术改造的指示，贯彻执行这些指示，必将把我国的工农联盟推进到一个新的阶段。
    我们强调农民问题，决不意味着可以忽视工人阶级的领导，决不意味着可以放松对农民的教育和改造。恰恰相反，坚持工人阶级的革命领导权，坚持对农民的教育和改造，这也是毛泽东同志一贯的思想。毛泽东同志指出：“人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导。因为只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”?毛泽东同志又指出：工人阶级要实现其领导，必须具备两个条件：“（甲）率领被领导者（同盟者）向着共同敌人作坚决的斗争，并取得胜利；（乙）对被领导者给以物质福利，至少不损害其利益，同时对被领导者给以政治教育。”?我们党的工作，正是按照这些指示去做的。我们说满足农民的利益，是从农民的根本利益——实现社会主义、共产主义出发的，并不是迁就农民的狭隘的利益。我们说相信农民、团结农民，是相信农民可以在工人阶级的领导下，自觉地走社会主义、共产主义的道路，并不是说农民可以自发地走社会主义、共产主义的道路。我们在强调农业是国民经济基础的同时，充分地发挥工业的主导作用，坚定不移地用现代工业来改造农业、武装农业；并不是抓了农业，放松了工业。我们在关心农民的物质利益的同时，不倦地加强对农民的政治教育，并且把政治教育放在首要地位。总之，以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础，这是一个完整的不可分割的方针，过去我们全面地执行了这个方针，今后还要全面地坚持这个方针。以农业为基础，以工业为主导，把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来，这也是一个完整的、不可分割的方针，过去我们全面地执行了这个方针，今后还要全面地坚持这个方针。五
    能不能“站在最大多数劳动人民的一面”，这是一个世界观问题，是马克思列宁主义和右倾机会主义的一个根本分歧。毛泽东同志说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。……斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑，他们也是决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是马克思主义的又一条定律。……阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。拿这个观点解释历史的就叫做历史的唯物主义，站在这个观点的反面的是历史的唯心主义。”?事情正是这样。阶级矛盾是不可调和的。人类几千年的文明史就是一部阶级斗争史。在阶级斗争中，不管经过怎样曲折的道路，人民必然要胜利，反动阶级必然要灭亡，人民是历史的创造者，历史的发展决定于人民的生产斗争和阶级斗争。这就是历史唯物主义的世界观。与此相反的，就是历史唯心主义的世界观。马克思主义者正是从历史唯物主义世界观出发，认为必须坚定地站在劳动人民的一面，代表劳动人民的利益，放手发动群众，坚决依靠群众，进行真正的彻底的人民革命。而右倾机会主义者则是在历史唯心主义世界观的支配下，站在资产阶级的一面，不相信劳动人民，不敢放手发动劳动人民进行真正的彻底的人民革命。我们一定要坚决反对资产阶级的历史唯心主义的世界观，树立和巩固无产阶级的历史唯物主义的世界观，永远站在最大多数劳动人民的一面。只有这样，才能从根本上和右倾机会主义思想划清界限，作一个真正的马克思列宁主义者。
    改造世界观的基本途径是学习、批判和实践三者结合。就是说：必须认真学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作；必须不断批判资产阶级思想，特别是现代修正主义思想；必须深入实际、深入群众，加强劳动锻炼和实际斗争的锻炼。在目前，特别重要的是必须抓紧对《毛泽东选集》第四卷的学习。《毛泽东选集》第四卷的出版，为我们改造世界观提供了强有力的思想武器。我们应当认真学习毛泽东同志的伟大的马克思列宁主义的理论著作。学习毛泽东同志为了劳动人民的利益敢于斗争、敢于胜利的最坚定、最彻底的革命精神；学习毛泽东同志坚决依靠大多数劳动人民、放手发动大多数劳动人民的无产阶级的革命立场；学习毛泽东同志重视农民问题、不倦地巩固和发展工农联盟的马克思列宁主义的思想，永远地站在最大多数劳动人民的一面。
    我国革命事业和建设事业的胜利，就是马克思列宁主义的胜利，就是把马克思列宁主义的普遍原理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的胜利。马克思列宁主义，毛泽东同志的著作，是指导我们各项事业由胜利走向胜利的强大的思想武器。我们清醒地知道，在我们前进的道路上，还会有种种障碍，种种困难。但是，只要我们能够掌握马克思列宁主义的科学，努力学习毛泽东同志的著作，永远站在最大多数劳动人民的一面，我们是完全能够超越任何障碍和战胜任何困难的。任何力量也不能阻止我们前进。
