Guangzhou Public Bus Company's No. 292 bus is a "vintage car" assembled from various brands of old parts. At the beginning of this year, when drivers Li Hong and Chen Jiaguang took over driving this bus, it consumed 15.75 kilograms of gasoline per 100 kilometers, failing to meet the fuel consumption plan. What to do?

Communist Party member Li Hong thought to himself: "The machine of the vehicle is dead, but the people are alive. We must make the vehicle listen to our commands and save gasoline for the country." He and another driver, Chen Jiaguang, and conductors Wu Dongcheng and Liao Zhixing discussed and jointly formulated a plan to "completely renovate" the "vintage car." In a short month, they thoroughly overhauled and cleaned all the electrical equipment on the car, and used scrap materials to repair and replace parts, restoring the "vintage car" to its youth.

Then, Li Hong and Chen Jiaguang further explored ways to save gasoline. They developed a set of "driving regulations" that both shifts of drivers would follow: drive the vehicle at a medium speed, not too fast or too slow; operate the controls lightly and quickly, without arbitrarily increasing the "throttle"; use all slopes along the way to "glide" without adding fuel. After adopting these methods, they reduced gasoline consumption again and again. Now the car they drive can travel ten kilometers on one kilogram of gasoline.

    汽油消耗一减再减
    广州市公共汽车公司二九二号公共汽车，是一辆用多种牌子的残旧零件装成的“老爷车”。今年初，汽车司机李洪、陈家光接手驾驶这辆车时，每百公里耗用汽油一五点七五公斤，不能完成燃料消耗计划。怎么办？
    共产党员李洪心里想：“车辆的机器是死的，人是活的。一定要叫车辆听我们的使唤，替国家节约汽油。”他和另一个汽车司机陈家光、乘务员伍东成、廖志兴一起讨论，共同制定了“大翻新”那辆“老爷车”的计划。在短短一个月的时间里，彻底检修和清洁了车上的全部电器装置，并利用废旧料修配了部件和零件，使“老爷车”恢复了青春。
    接着，李洪、陈家光进一步摸索节约汽油的经验。他们制定了一套统一两班司机操作的“驾驶规程”：车辆行驶不快不慢，经常保持中速行车；驾驶操作脚轻手快，不随意加大“油门”；行驶途中利用一切斜坡，进行不加油的“滑行”。他们采取以上办法以后，使汽油消耗一减再减。现在他们驾驶的汽车，一公斤汽油就可以跑十公里。
