Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 20th—The Sixth Congress of the All-Burma Students' Union opened this morning in the meeting hall of the Rangoon University Student Union. The meeting will last for three days.

Three hundred and thirty-six student representatives and observers from twenty-eight counties and towns in Burma attended the meeting.

Representatives from organizations such as the Burma National United Front, the Burma Peace Committee, and the People's Comrade Party were also invited to attend the opening ceremony.

The All-Burma Students' Union issued a statement on the 18th, strongly condemning the crime of Japanese fascist thugs assassinating Inejiro Asanuma with the connivance of the US-Japan reactionaries, and demanding the immediate release of students arrested by the Japanese authorities for participating in demonstrations against the assassination of Asanuma.

The statement said that the All-Burma Students' Union firmly supports the Japanese students' struggle against the fascist thugs who assassinated the outstanding Japanese politician Asanuma and their demand for the Ikeda cabinet to resign collectively.
