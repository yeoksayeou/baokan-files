    Increase Management Measures and Launch Overproduction Competitions
    Southern Regions Strive for Large and Full Late Rice Ears
    (Our Newspaper News) Under the encouragement of the Party and the people’s policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, the vast number of farmers in Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan and other provinces have further strengthened the late-stage management of late rice, are vigorously attacking the ear and grain stage, and are striving to increase production and harvests.
    Guangdong
    The late rice over-contracted production movement has swept every corner of the province. The Zhanjiang Special Zone, which has the largest area of ​​late rice, People's Communes launched a mass movement to vigorously develop high-yield late rice fields. More than 2.4 million people in the area participated in the high-yield competition. The counties in the Shaoguan Special Zone and the Xingmei area of ​​the Shantou Special Zone, which have more mountain pits and low-yielding fields, adopted the method of concentrating leadership, labor, and fertilizer to advance into the mountain pits and low-yielding fields. The Jiangmen Special Zone recently launched a large-scale green manure intercropping movement for late rice topdressing. More than 1.3 million people in the area went to the mountains to cut grass for intercropping, accumulating more than 5 million dan of green manure in one day. The counties in the coastal Shantou Special Zone also organized thousands of boats to go out to sea to collect sea fertilizer.
    Fujian
    The late rice in various places has generally grown stalks and is in the booting stage. The vast number of farmers are seizing the opportunity to carry out a late-stage field management movement centered on processing and fertilization and disaster prevention. After inspecting and evaluating more than 80,000 mu of Class III seedlings, Lianjiang, Qingning and other counties immediately dispatched 100,000 people and more than 5,000 vehicles (ships) to fertilize and weed all Class III rice fields in three days. While continuing to strengthen the late-stage field management of late rice, various places also generally attach importance to "three removals" (removing diseases, insects, and animal pests) and "five preventions" (preventing lodging, wind, drought, waterlogging, and low temperature), and vigorously prevent various natural disasters in conjunction with late-stage processing and fertilization to protect the healthy growth of late rice. Three special zones, Jinjiang, Longyan, etc., combined topdressing of ear fertilizer and spraying pesticides, etc., to prevent and control diseases and insect pests in an area of ​​more than 2.25 million mu. Of the more than 660,000 mu of rice fields where diseases and insect pests have occurred, more than 630,000 mu have also been treated as soon as they occurred.
    Zhejiang
    The vast number of farmers, with the spirit of continuous revolution, are vigorously attacking the late rice to protect ears and grains. The communes in Wenzhou and Jinhua Special Zones, where the season is earlier, are seizing the opportunity to intensively cultivate late rice. More than 100,000 laborers in Yueqing County fully carried out one more fertilization and one more weeding in 300,000 mu of late rice fields. All more than 10,000 mu of Class III seedlings in the county were given double fertilization. The commune members are determined to strive for early ripening and even ripening, balanced and high yields. More than 400 production teams, small teams and vast numbers of commune members in Jinyun County are linked to each other to carry out late-stage intensive management competitions for late rice. The vast number of commune members in the Hangjiahu Plain and Ningbo Special Zone are also striving to increase the application of thermal fertilizer, shallow irrigation and drainage, and eliminate weeds and pests, so as to promote early and even booting and early maturity of late rice, and reduce the amount of empty grains to the minimum.
    Hubei
    The second-season late rice in the Yangtze River area has grown vigorously after the drought resistance and seedling protection and cultivation management during the seedling period. At present, the communes in various places have fixed specialized teams to strengthen the late-stage field management of late rice. While vigorously reclaiming wasteland and deep plowing, the Huanggang Special Zone has launched a production increase movement for late rice to catch up with early rice and surpass early rice. The Xishui County of this special zone organized 80,000 laborers to carry out a blitz of weeding and topdressing of second-season rice to eliminate Class III seedlings. The Nanhe Commune in Yingshan County had 2,800 mu of weedy land in 12,000 mu of second-season rice. They seized the opportunity after the rain and organized more than 6,000 people to fight for two days, adopting the method of weeding, hoeing, and topdressing, and applying 80 dan of fire fertilizer per mu.
    Hunan
    At present, the late rice in Hunan Province is generally in the period of heading and flowering, which is particularly in need of water. Therefore, overcoming the autumn drought has become the key to striving for late rice to surpass early rice. The province has mobilized 1.2 million troops to resist drought and protect seedlings, and is launching a fierce battle against the autumn drought.
    Qidong County, which is the most severely affected by drought, has concentrated 50% of its labor force to fight the drought. The county has dug a total of 270 wells, dug more than 1,600 sand pools, and drained and diverted water ditches up to 194 kilometers, rescuing 45,000 mu of late rice seedlings that were severely affected by the drought.
    Various places have also made overall plans according to local conditions and given full play to the role of existing water sources, labor, and tools. Many People's Communes in Longhui County have adopted the method of secretaries being responsible for districts, committee members being responsible for teams, cadres being responsible for groups, and drought resistance battle groups being responsible for plots, and quickly implemented water sources, labor, and tools to groups and individuals. The Tantou Commune alone rescued 10,732 mu of seedlings in three days, accounting for 98% of the drought-affected seedling land.

    增加管理措施　开展超产竞赛
    南方地区力争晚稻穗大粒饱
    本报讯　广东、福建、浙江、湖北、湖南等省广大农民，在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的方针鼓舞下，进一步加强晚稻后期管理，猛攻穗粒关，力争增产多收。
    广东
    晚稻超包产运动，已席卷全省每个角落。晚稻面积最多的湛江专区各人民公社，开展了群众性的大搞晚稻高产田运动，全区二百四十多万人参加了高产竞赛；山坑低产田较多的韶关专区和汕头专区的兴梅地区各县，采取领导、劳力和肥料三集中，向山坑低产田进军；江门专区最近为晚稻追肥展开了一次大规模的绿肥压青运动，全区出动一百三十多万人上山割草压青，一天内就积绿肥五百多万担。沿海的汕头专区各县也组织千船万艇出海打捞海肥。
    福建
    各地晚稻已普遍圆秆孕穗，广大农民正抓紧时机，开展以加工加肥和预防灾害为中心的后期田间管理运动。连江、清宁等县在检查评比中发现有八万多亩三类苗后，立即以十万人和五千多辆（艘）车船，在三天中为所有三类稻田施了一遍肥、除了一遍草。各地在继续加强晚稻后期田间管理中，还普遍重视“三除”（除病、虫、兽害）、“五防”（防倒伏、防风、防旱、防涝、防低温）等工作，结合后期加工加肥等工作大力防治各种自然灾害，保护晚稻的茁壮成长。晋江、龙岩等三个专区结合追施穗肥和喷射农药等，预防病虫害面积达二百二十五万多亩，已发生病虫害的六十六万多亩稻田，有六十三万多亩也作到随发生随扑灭。
    浙江
    广大农民以不断革命精神，猛攻晚稻保穗保粒关。季节较早的温州、金华专区各公社正在抓紧时机，突击培育晚稻。乐清县十多万名劳动大军在三十万亩晚稻田中全面进行了多施一次肥、多耘一遍田，全县一万多亩三类苗全部施了双重肥，社员们决心争取早熟齐熟、平衡高产。缙云县四百多个生产队和各小队、广大社员互相挂钩，开展晚稻后期精管细管竞赛。杭嘉湖平原和宁波专区各地广大社员，也正在争取增施热性肥料、浅灌搁田和消灭草荒、扑灭螟虫等措施，促使晚稻早齐穗、早成熟，把秕谷降低到最低限度。
    湖北
    长江两岸地区的二季晚稻，经过抗旱保苗和幼苗期间的培育管理，大部分生长茁壮。当前，各地公社都固定专业班子，加强晚稻后期田间管理工作。黄冈专区在大搞开荒、深翻的同时，掀起了晚稻赶早稻、超早稻的增产运动。这个专区的浠水县组织了八万劳力，突击二季稻的薅草追肥，消灭三类苗。英山县南河公社一万二千亩二季稻，有二千八百亩草荒，他们抓紧雨后时机，组织六千多人，大战两天，采取边锄草、边薅脚、再追肥的方法，每亩增施火粪八十担。
    湖南
    现在，湖南省晚稻一般正处于抽穗扬花特别需要水分的时期，因此，战胜秋旱已成了力争晚稻超早稻的关键，全省已经调集了一百二十万大军抗旱保苗，正向秋旱展开了激烈的战斗。
    受旱最严重的祁东县，全县已集中了50％的劳动力大战干旱，全县共挖井二百七十口，挖砂凼一千六百多处，排、引水沟达一百九十四公里，抢救出了受旱严重的四万五千亩晚稻禾苗。
    各地还因地制宜，全面规划，充分发挥了现有水源、劳力、工具的作用。隆回县许多人民公社采取了书记包片，委员包队，干部包组，抗旱战斗组包到丘的办法，将水源、劳力、工具迅速落实到组、到人，仅滩头公社三天内就抢救出了一万零七百三十二亩禾苗，占受旱禾苗地98％。
