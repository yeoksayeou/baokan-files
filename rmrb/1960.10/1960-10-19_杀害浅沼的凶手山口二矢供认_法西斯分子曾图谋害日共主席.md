Xinhua News Agency, October 18th, Tokyo Dispatch: The assassin of Inejiro Asanuma, Otoya Yamaguchi, confessed yesterday that he had also conspired to assassinate the Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, Sanzo Nosaka, under the instructions of Japanese fascist leaders.

According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, Yamaguchi confessed during interrogation that he admired Hitler and followed the notorious Japanese fascist assassination ringleader, Nissho Inoue, who advocated the doctrine of "one person kills one person." The murderer confessed that since July of this year, Inoue Nissho, who instructed him, had been planning to assassinate Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Socialist Party, and Takeshi Kobayashi, Chairman of the Japan Teachers Union. This summer, Yamaguchi had been lurking near the residences of Sanzo Nosaka and Takeshi Kobayashi. Yamaguchi had also made several phone calls to the two of them to check their movements.

According to the confession, the criminal originally planned to take advantage of Sanzo Nosaka's speech in Tokyo on October 13th to assassinate him. However, since the three-party speech meeting of the Socialist Party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party happened to be held the day before Nosaka Sanzo's speech, he changed his plan and first assassinated Asanuma.

According to the "Mainichi Shimbun" report, the murderer Otoya Yamaguchi is not only a member of the fascist organizations "Great Japan Patriotic Party" and "Asian Anti-Communist Youth League," but also the son of Jinpei Yamaguchi, an official of the Japanese government's "Defense Agency" and a first-class Rikusa (Army Colonel).

After Asanuma was murdered, Taizo Ishizaka, a representative of Japanese monopoly capitalists who frequently provided funds to fascist violence groups, openly told reporters that he "could understand" the murder of Asanuma.

The day before Asanuma's assassination, the Japanese National Police Agency convened a meeting of police chiefs, instructing them to intensify the suppression of democratic forces before the general election.

    杀害浅沼的凶手山口二矢供认
    法西斯分子曾图谋害日共主席
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：刺杀浅沼稻次郎的凶手山口二矢昨天供认，他在日本法西斯头目的指使下还曾经阴谋杀害日本共产党主席野坂参三。
    据东京警视厅说，山口二矢在审问中供认，他崇拜希特勒，并追随倡导“一人杀一个”主义的日本臭名昭彰的法西斯暗杀头子井上日昭。这个凶手招认，自从今年7月以来，指使他的井上日昭就在策划杀害日本共产党主席野坂参三、社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎和日本教职员工会委员长小林武。今年夏天，山口二矢就在野坂参三和小林武的住宅附近窥伺过。山口还曾经打了几次电话给他们二人，查看他们的行动。
    据供认，凶犯原来打算在10月13日利用野坂参三在东京举行演讲会的机会杀害他的。但是，后来因为社会党、自由民主党和民主社会党的三党演说会恰巧在野坂参三的演讲会前一天举行，他改变计划首先刺杀了浅沼。
    据“每日新闻”报道，杀人犯山口二矢不仅是法西斯组织“大日本爱国党”和“亚洲反共青年联盟”的成员，而且是日本政府“防卫厅”官员、一等陆佐（陆军上校）山口晋平的儿子。
    浅沼被害后，经常向法西斯暴力团体提供资金的日本垄断资本家代表石坂泰三公开地向新闻记者说：他对杀害浅沼的事件是“能够理解的”。
    在浅沼遭杀害的前一天，日本警察厅曾召集警察头子开会，指令他们在大选前加紧镇压民主力量。
