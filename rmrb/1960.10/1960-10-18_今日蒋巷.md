    Leaving the eastern suburbs of Nanchang, on the left bank of the Gan River, the rhythmic roar of machinery can be heard in the distance. In the emerald green fields, rows of electric and gas-powered pumps, facing the rising sun, raise their throats and spray golden waves, moistening the undulating rice paddies. Not far away, is a huge artificial lake, a majestic dam blocking its throat, and three main canals as long as seventy *li* and countless branch canals, like blood vessels, stretching into the boundless fields. People are working hard to draw water and fertilize the late rice and autumn vegetables, and everywhere is filled with joyous labor. This is the Jiangxiang People's Commune in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province.

    Jiangxiang, this poor and remote place that "suffers from drought after ten days without rain, and floods the sky after three days of heavy rain," has undergone earth-shaking changes in the two years since the establishment of the People's Commune. This commune, with a population of 60,000, sowed 120,000 *mu* of early rice and 140,000 *mu* of late rice this year, an increase of 50,000 *mu* in total compared to before communization. Entering the village, whether in front of or behind the houses, or in the corners of the courtyards, even if it is only a square foot, it is full of sesame seeds, soybeans, green vegetables, radishes…that are about to be harvested. This is also a red banner commune in the city for hog production and a major base for supplying commercial vegetables to Nanchang City.

    Conquering Nature
    Drought and flood are such heartbreaking words for the people here! People still clearly remember: before liberation, dikes were breached year after year, and every spring the whole family had to go out and wander, and after the flood season, they would come back to plant some melons and vegetables to make a living. After liberation, through the cooperative movement and with the help of the state, more than a dozen large and small dikes were built around the commune, but they still could not withstand major droughts and floods. Only in the era of the People's Commune has the long-cherished wish been realized. In the first winter after the establishment of the commune, a large-scale water control campaign was launched. The dikes were raised and reinforced, and the Lianwei ditch and Maxigang, two large-scale projects with a total length of eighty *li*, were widened and opened. Forty thousand *mu* of land in the commune, which used to be prone to drought and flood disasters and yielded no harvest year after year, has been turned into fertile land free from drought and flood. Even if it does not rain for 120 days, a good harvest can be guaranteed. Last winter and this spring, the Huangdu dam construction project was launched. Huangdu is a tributary of the Gan River. Such a dam project was unimaginable in the past, but today, after the people's commune, being able to order the river to make way is so exciting! Under the battle cry of "Forcing the river to make way and ordering the lake bottom to turn over," more than 16,000 cadres and commune members of the commune formed 317 shock brigades and set up camp at the construction site. During the rush repair, all the laborers became more and more enthusiastic, and the more they fought, the stronger they became. Despite the bitter cold wind and heavy snow, no one retreated. The Sunzhou Brigade, led by Wu Yangpo, formed the "Xiang Xiuli Shock Brigade." Wherever the task was arduous, there were their footprints. No matter what difficulties, they could not stop the determination of the water conservancy pioneers to build the reservoir; the "Dong Cunrui Shock Brigade" of the Zhoufang Brigade, in the heavy snow, they used their hands to dig open the snow blocks and opened a pedestrian path to ensure continuous soil transportation. Comrade Wan Changbing, the secretary of the commune party committee in charge of the construction site, always wore a bamboo hat, a straw raincoat, and bare feet to transport soil with the laborers during the day; at night, he often appeared in the workers' sheds, asking about their well-being. Now, the completion of this dam reservoir can not only drain water but also prevent drought, making the irrigation of more than 20,000 *mu* of fields in Huangdu, Fangzhou and other places automatic, and even more land has been freed from floods and won the first summer harvest. Today, people enthusiastically call it the "Happiness Reservoir."

    The eastern part of Jiangxiang Commune is adjacent to Poyang Lake, with large tracts of virgin land that have been sleeping for thousands of years that can be reclaimed and utilized; due to the construction of water conservancy projects year after year, many lake islands that could not be cultivated in the past can now be cultivated within the commune. Under the encouragement of the Party's policy of "planting more and harvesting more, and achieving high yields and harvesting more," the commune members, holding high the red flag of the People's Commune, are determined to turn these barren islands into granaries. This spring, more than 6,000 strong young people in the commune went to the Poyang Lake islands, which were overgrown with weeds. There were no people for hundreds of *li* along the Poyang Lake, and it was difficult to eat and live for a while. They built more than 120 grass sheds and temporary stoves on the grass islands, settled down, and reclaimed these lands that had been sleeping all year round. In summer, the stagnant water burned people uncomfortably, the water chestnuts in the lake bottom stung their legs painfully, and the mosquitoes bit them at night so they couldn't sleep, but no one complained. On the contrary, the more they fought, the stronger they became. More than 40 young people led by Liu Fengzi, the captain of the Nanfang Brigade, fought on the lake island for three months and planted early rice on 1,600 *mu* of lake fields. After a spring of hard work, the commune reclaimed 18,000 *mu* of land and planted it all with early rice, achieving a good harvest.

    The East Wind Blows Vigorously
    Like commune members all over the country, the commune members of Jiangxiang Commune, in the national technological revolution movement, studied the theory of continuous revolution and machinery manufacturing day and night, forgetting to eat and sleep. How much power will be generated when people grasp Mao Zedong Thought! The countryside was shaken, everyone made innovations, everything made innovations, and every process had innovations. Rice transplanters, Leap Forward double-headed plows, double-ox harrows, soybean threshers, double-dragon waterwheels, weeding machines...these are the new agricultural tools they created. In the past, if a small part of a water pump broke, it had to be taken to Nanchang City for repair, which not only delayed agricultural work but also failed to respond to emergencies.

    In the technological revolution movement, people set up their own agricultural machinery factories. In just a few months, they repaired 42 water pumps, cast a large number of water pump parts themselves, and promoted 594 rice transplanters throughout the commune. The area planted by machine reached 40,000 *mu*, saving more than 30,000 laborers. Thanks to the participation of this new force in the battle, the losses caused by the cold wave were reduced. Not only did they catch up with the rice transplanting season, but the early rice area also expanded by 19,000 *mu* compared to last year. More than 3,900 weeding tools were promoted, basically realizing semi-mechanized weeding. Due to the use of ox-drawn or electric threshers, the early rice was threshed in a timely manner. Many pig farms have achieved semi-mechanized cutting of feed and automated feeding, and many canteens have achieved semi-mechanized cutting of vegetables.

    From the elderly to the children, everyone wants to try driving the machine. The women's "Ten Fragrances Team" of the Nanfang Brigade studied hard day and night. They used the rice transplanter freely, transplanting more than 7 *mu* per machine per day, and the whole team completed the transplanting task in ten days.

    The People's Commune not only strengthened the peasants' courage, daring to think and dare to act, and daring to create, but also cultivated a new style of the people. The Ziqiang Brigade had less land and was relatively poor, and the Zhoudu Brigade gave 600 *mu* of lake fields they had reclaimed to the Ziqiang Brigade. The Ziqiang Brigade was very moved. In order to live up to the expectations of the Zhoudu Brigade, they planted a season of late rice on these 600 *mu* of lake fields and cultivated them with special care. Now they are more than one person tall. After the late rice was transplanted, there was no heavy rain, and half of the 2,600 *mu* of late rice in the Dahu Brigade suffered from drought. They were too busy to cope with it for a while. When the members of the neighboring Nanfang Brigade learned about this situation, they were very anxious. After mass discussion, they immediately sent a 20-horsepower diesel engine to support them. And they themselves kept the oxcarts to draw water. This kind of relationship between people just reflects the characteristics of our era.

    Thriving Day by Day
    Under the leadership of the Party, the peasants have won continuous great leaps forward, and the material and cultural life of the commune members has also risen year after year with the development of production. People enthusiastically praise their public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens for being well-run. The 314 public canteens in the commune have been further consolidated. Each canteen has established production bases for growing vegetables, raising pigs, raising poultry, raising fish, and processing non-staple foods, with an average of more than two *fen* of vegetable plots per person, so that the commune members can eat their fill, eat well, and eat cleanly.

    The health of the commune members has also been guaranteed. Since the establishment of the commune, Jiangxiang Commune has implemented free medical care, completely solving the pain of commune members who used to be treated if they had money, and delayed treatment if they had no money; for minor illnesses, they can seek medical treatment in the hospitals and health centers run by the commune itself, and for serious illnesses, they can be sent to hospitals with better conditions. Since the beginning of this year, not only have the temporary minor illnesses of commune members been treated in a timely manner, but also some old patients who had lost their labor force have recovered their health and returned to the production front after treatment.

    Various cultural activities are rich and colorful. The commune has established 58 Red and Expert Schools with the brigade as the unit, and 314 amateur cultural classes with the canteen as the unit. After a day of work, people go to the amateur cultural classes to study culture.

    今日蒋巷
    蒋巷公社党委书记　公唐水
    本报记者　王德生
    出南昌东郊，赣江左岸，远处传来有节奏的机器隆隆声。在碧绿的田野上，一排一排的电动和煤气抽水机，迎着初升的太阳，高昂着喉咙喷射着金色的浪花，润露着那起伏的稻田。再不远，是一片巨大的人工湖，一座雄伟的拦河大坝，堵住了它的咽喉，三条长达七十华里的干渠道和无数的支渠道，就像血管一样伸向一望无际的田野。人们正在紧张地为扬花的晚稻和秋菜引水、施肥，处处是欢乐的劳动。这里就是江西省南昌县蒋巷人民公社。
    蒋巷这个“十天不雨旱成灾，大雨三天水漫天”的穷乡僻壤，在人民公社成立两年的今天，已经起了翻天复地的变化。这个拥有六万人的公社，今年播种十二万亩早稻，十四万亩晚稻，两季加起来比公社化前扩种了五万亩。走进村，不论村前村后，屋边屋角，尽管是步尺见方，到处是即将收获的芝麻、大豆、青菜、萝卜……。这里还是全市养猪生产红旗公社，是供应南昌市商品蔬菜的主要基地。
    征服自然
    旱涝对这里的人们说来，是多么伤心的字眼呵！人们还清楚的记得：解放前连年决堤，那时春天总是全家出去流浪，汛期过去，再回来种点瓜菜糊口。解放后，经过合作化运动，又在国家扶助下，才把全社百里方圆，大小十几个圩堤修筑起来，但仍不能挡住较大的旱涝灾害，只是在人民公社的时代，才实现了梦寐以求的愿望。公社成立的第一个冬天，大规模的治水运动就展开了。圩堤加高加固了，两条长达八十华里的联圩沟、马洗港巨大工程挖宽挖通了，全社四万亩常受旱涝灾害，常年不收的土地，变成了水旱无忧的良田，即使一百二十天不下雨，也能保收。去冬今春又开展了兴修黄渡拦河水库工程。黄渡是赣江的一条支流，这样的拦河工程，过去人们想都不敢想，而在人民公社化后的今天，能够喝令河水让路，人们是多么兴奋呵！在“迫使河水让路，命令湖底翻身”的战斗号召下，全社一万六千多名干部和社员组成了三百十七个突击队，来到工地安营扎寨。在抢修中，全体民工干劲越鼓越足，越战越强，尽管寒风刺骨，大雪交加，也没有一个人退缩。孙州大队，以伍杨婆为首的十位姑娘成立了“向秀丽突击队”，哪里任务艰巨，哪里就有她们的足迹，无论任何困难，都阻挡不住水利尖兵建成水库的决心；周坊大队的“董存瑞突击队”，在大雪天，他们用手扒开雪块，打开一条人行道，保证连续运土。在工地负责的公社党委书记万长炳同志，白天总是戴着斗笠，穿着蓑衣，一双赤足，和民工一起运土；晚上，他又常出没在工棚，问寒问暖。现在这座拦河水库的建成，既能排涝，又能防旱，使黄渡、芳洲等地二万多亩田，实现了水利自流化，还有更多的土地，摆脱了涝灾，获得了第一个夏季丰收。如今，人们热情地把它称为“幸福水库”。
    蒋巷公社东部与鄱阳湖接壤，有大片沉睡万年的处女地可以开垦利用；由于连年兴修水利，公社范围内，许多过去不能耕种的湖洲，现在也可以耕种了。在党的“多种多收与高产多收”方针鼓舞下，社员们高举人民公社的红旗，决心要把这些荒芜的洲地变成粮仓。今年春天，全社六千多名身强力壮的青壮年，开到杂草丛生的鄱阳湖洲。鄱阳湖边百里无人烟，一时吃住都很困难。他们在草洲上搭起了一百二十多个草棚和临时锅灶，安家落户，开垦这些终年沉睡的土地，夏天渍水烫的人们难受，湖底的菱角刺得腿上发痛，黑夜蚊子咬得不能入睡，但是没有人叫苦，相反地干劲越战越强。由南坊大队队长刘风子领导的四十多名青年在湖洲上大战了三个月，在一千六百亩湖田种上了早稻。经过一春的努力，全社开垦一万八千亩土地，并全部种上了早稻，获得了好收成。
    东风劲吹
    像全国各地一样，蒋巷公社的社员们，在全民的技术革命运动中，废寝忘食地钻研起不断革命论和机械制造的理论来了。当人们掌握了毛泽东思想，就会产生多么大的力量！农村震动了，人人闹革新，事事闹革新，道道工序都有革新。插秧机，跃进双头犁，双牛耙，打豆机，双龙水车，耘禾器……这些就是他们创造的新式农具。过去抽水机坏了一个小零件，都要跑到南昌市去修理，既误农时，又不应急。
    在技术革命运动中，人们自己动手办起了农具机械厂，短短的几个月时间，就修理了抽水机四十二部，自己翻砂配制了大量的抽水机零件，全社推广了插秧机五百九十四部，机插面积达四万亩，节约劳动力三万多个。由于这支新军投入战斗，寒潮侵袭的损失减少了，不仅赶上了插秧季节，早稻面积也比去年扩大了一万九千亩。推广了三千九百多部耘禾工具，基本上实现了耘禾半机械化，由于采用了牛拉或电动打谷机，及时打完了早稻。许多养猪场实现了切料半机械化，喂食自流化，许多食堂实现了切菜半机械化。
    驾机器，从老人到孩子都想试一试。南坊大队的妇女“十香队”，人人日夜苦学，插秧机在她们手里运用自如，每天每部插秧七亩多，全队十天时间完成了插秧任务。
    人民公社不仅壮大了农民的胆量，敢想敢干，敢于创造，同时也陶冶着人们新的风尚。自强大队土地较少，比较穷，洲头大队把自己开垦的六百亩湖田送给了自强大队。自强大队很受感动，为了不辜负洲头大队的期望，把这六百亩湖田种上了一季晚稻，培育得特别精细，现在长得一人多高。在晚稻插秧后，没有下过透雨，大湖大队的二千六百亩晚稻有一半受旱，一时忙不过来，邻近的南坊大队社员知道这个情况，十分着急，经过群众讨论，立即抽出一部二十马力柴油机前去支援。而他们自己却留着牛车车水。人与人之间的这种关系，恰恰反映着我们时代的特色。
    蒸蒸日上
    党领导农民夺得连年大跃进，社员的物质文化生活也随着生产的发展，连年上升，人们热情地赞美自己的公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园办得好。全社三百一十四个公共食堂，进一步巩固了，每个食堂都建立了种菜、养猪、养禽、养鱼、副食品加工等生产基地，每人平均有菜地二分以上，使社员吃饱、吃好、吃得干净。
    社员的健康也得到了保证。自建社以来，蒋巷公社就实行了公费医疗，彻底解决了社员过去有钱就治，无钱就拖的痛苦；小病，可以在公社自办的医院、卫生所就医，大病可以送住条件较好的医院。今年以来，不仅社员的临时患小病得到及时治愈，而且使一些丧失劳动力的老病人经过治疗，恢复了健康，重返生产战线。
    各种文化生活丰富多彩。全社以大队为单位建立了五十八个红专学校，以食堂为单位建立了三百一十四个业余文化班，人们一天劳动之后，都进业余文化班学习文化。
