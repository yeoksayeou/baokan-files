Continuously Enhance the Thought of Taking Agriculture as the Foundation

Liu Ci'kai, First Secretary of the Jilin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

Developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation is a consistent policy of the Party. As early as 1934, Chairman Mao pointed out that "agricultural production is the first priority of our economic construction work." Since then, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly instructed us to pay special attention to agriculture, especially to the development of grain production, and to build the national economy on a solid foundation. The Party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of cadres in the Jilin region, following this policy of the Party, have done a lot of work in supporting agriculture in the past few years. After the Party put forward the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, our understanding has become deeper, and our enthusiasm for supporting agriculture has become higher. The system of "factory-commune pairing" and "departmental alignment" has been fully implemented; the atmosphere of full support and proactive service has been universally established. Many factories regard supporting agriculture as a most glorious task. In supporting agricultural production, if there are no materials, they mobilize the masses to save and utilize waste materials; if there is no time, the workers automatically carry out crash projects in their spare time. Some large state-owned enterprises with particularly heavy production tasks also squeeze out some manpower to produce agricultural machinery and equipment for the communes and train technical workers. Some small enterprises with simple equipment also do their best to support agriculture.

Before October last year, only 30% of the rural people's communes in the region had mechanical repair factories. Now, more than 80% of the communes have established agricultural machinery repair factories with two to nine machine tools, and the total number of machine tools has increased by two times. At the same time, nearly 70% of the management districts have established iron and wood farm tool factories, and county-run machinery factories have also expanded their scale, and a network for the repair and manufacture of agricultural machinery has been initially formed. Seventy new small power stations have been built, 192 kilometers of lines have been erected, and the number of management districts that have achieved low-standard electrification has more than doubled. At the same time, more than 3,700 mechanical, electrical and other technical workers have been trained for the communes, and a large number of agricultural machinery, fertilizers, and pesticides have been produced to meet the needs of the farming season. Thanks to the vigorous support of all sectors of the city and the vigorous development of the rural tool reform movement, the degree of agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization has been greatly improved, which has effectively overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor. As a result, the sown area of the entire region this year has increased by more than 300,000 mu compared with last year, and the sowing of dry land and the transplanting of paddy fields have been advanced by more than half a month compared with previous years. Although the temperature has been low, the sunshine has been short, and there have been serious grass shortages, floods, and insect pests from spring to now, the grain harvest is still expected to be good from the current situation.

However, some comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of developing agriculture and the great responsibility of industry in the technological transformation of agriculture, and there are still some incorrect ideas about supporting agriculture. In November last year, at the Third Congress of the Communist Party of China in Jilin City, the Party's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation was seriously discussed, and various incorrect ideas that violated this policy were examined and criticized, which improved the understanding of leading cadres. Subsequently, Party organizations at all levels deeply conveyed and publicized the spirit of the Municipal Party Congress among the broad masses of cadres and people, organized cadres to seriously study relevant documents, and many units also launched a great debate on the topics of "whether to support agriculture," "whether it is possible to support agriculture," "whether to support proactively or wait passively," and "whether to support in the long term or as an expedient measure." Through this series of work, the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy has become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the mass movement to support agriculture has been rapidly launched. In the process of the development of the movement, we have repeatedly carried out publicity and education on supporting agriculture, focusing on the tasks of each period and the ideological situation of cadres and the masses, so as to ensure that the movement is deepened step by step. Especially after the Party Central Committee issued the call for the whole Party to engage in agriculture in a big way and grain in a big way, through in-depth study of relevant documents, all cadres have further improved their understanding of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, thus setting off a larger-scale upsurge of urban support for rural areas and industrial support for agriculture. In just over a month, only two districts and five enterprises manufactured 955 various threshing machines, and only two districts and nine enterprises supported communes with 28 machine tools and more than 1,300 tools. Now, the mass movement of "100 factories, 1,000 machines, and 10,000 tools," centered on supporting the autumn harvest, is in full swing.

After the Municipal Party Congress, various industrial and mining enterprises and other units supporting agriculture organized visiting groups to visit the counties and communes they were supporting. Jilin Chemical Industry Company and its affiliated units organized as many as 15 visits to the countryside. The Jilin City Chuanying District Committee of the Communist Party of China and the vast majority of leading comrades of the affiliated factories have visited rural areas. The urban cadres' visits to rural areas have not only enabled them to understand the situation and needs of the rural areas, so that the support work is more in line with the actual situation of the rural areas, but also received a practical and vivid education with agriculture as the foundation. Many comrades reported that the more times they visited the countryside, the deeper their feelings for the countryside, and the more enthusiastic they were to support agriculture. Every time they visited the countryside, the support work deepened a step further. The Municipal Wood Factory originally thought that it was a factory that produced wooden furniture and could not support agriculture in any way. After visiting the commune, they realized that there were too many things they could support, so they helped the commune build 15 houses, helped the Panshi County Wood Factory realize the mechanization of sawing wood, and sent 40 carpenters to support the commune in manufacturing threshing tools. Recently, they are also preparing to produce various wooden farm tools, so that the factory's production is oriented towards the countryside. The director of the mechanical manufacturing workshop of a factory used to think that his production tasks were already very heavy, and that supporting agriculture would disrupt the production plan. He delayed making arrangements for the task of supporting agriculture assigned by the factory. When workers produced some farm tools in their spare time, he also criticized the workers for "taking on tasks casually," so the workers called him "stumbling block director." When he participated in the visiting group organized by the factory to visit the paired commune, he saw that the rural areas urgently needed mechanical equipment and new agricultural tools, and his attitude completely changed. After returning to the factory, he included the task of supporting agriculture in the work plan, and completed the agricultural machinery repair and assembly tasks that had been accumulated for more than a month in just two days. Because visiting rural areas has such a huge effect on improving the thinking of cadres, many units have made visiting rural areas a fixed system. For example, the Chuanying District Committee stipulates that leading cadres at the district and factory levels must visit the paired commune once a month, unless there are special circumstances. The broad masses of cadres also regard the rural people's commune as the best "school," and actively ask to go to the paired commune to "visit relatives" and receive education.

The proportion of industry in the Jilin region is very large. At present, the ratio of the industrial population to the agricultural population has reached one to 0.94. The rapid development of industry requires the corresponding development of agriculture, and the development of agricultural production must have the full support of industry and all sectors of society. Therefore, we must further implement the Party's policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation in the future, and continuously improve the understanding of all cadres and the broad masses of people on this policy, so as to continuously push forward the mass movement of supporting agriculture, so as to gradually realize the technological transformation of agriculture in a relatively short period of time and promote the more rapid development of agricultural production.

    不断提高以农业为基础的思想
    中共吉林市委第一书记　刘慈恺
    发展国民经济以农业为基础，是党一贯的方针。早在1934年毛主席就指出：“农业生产是我们经济建设工作的第一位”。此后，党中央和毛主席又一再指示我们要特别重视农业，尤其要重视粮食生产的发展，把国民经济建筑在巩固的基础之上。我们吉林地区各级党的组织和广大干部，遵循党的这一方针，几年来，在支援农业方面做了不少工作。党提出国民经济以农业为基础的方针之后，我们的体会更深刻了，支援农业的积极性也更高涨。“厂社挂钩”、“条条对口”的制度全面推行；全力支援、主动服务的风气普遍树立。许多工厂把支援农业当成一项最光荣的任务。在支援农业生产中，没有材料，就发动群众节约和利用废旧材料，没有时间，工人们就自动在业余时间突击。一些生产任务特别繁重的国营大企业，也挤出一部分力量为公社生产农业机具、设备和培训技术工人。一些设备简陋的小企业，也尽其所能地努力支援农业。
  　去年10月以前，全区只有30％的农村人民公社有机械修造厂。现在，80％以上的公社建立了具有两台到九台机床的农业机械修造厂，机床总数增加了两倍。同时，还有将近70％的管理区建立了铁木农具厂，县营机械厂也扩大了规模，农业机械的修造网已初步形成。新建小型电站七十处，架设线路一百九十二公里，实现低标准电气化的管理区比过去增加了一倍多。与此同时，还为公社培养了机械、电气等技术工人三千七百多名，适应农事季节，生产了大量的农机具和化肥、农药。由于全市各行各业的大力支援和农村工具改革运动的蓬勃开展，农业机械化和半机械化程度大大提高，有力地克服了劳动力不足的困难，从而使全区今年的播种面积比去年增加了三十多万亩，旱田播种和水田插秧比往年提前了半个多月。虽然，从春天到现在气温低、日照少，发生了严重的草荒、涝灾、虫害，但从目前情况来看，粮食仍可望获得好收成。
    但是，有些同志对发展农业的重要性和工业在农业技术改造中的重大责任认识不足，对支援农业还存在一些不正确的思想。去年11月间，在党的吉林市第三次代表大会上，认真地讨论了党的以农业为基础的方针，检查和批判了与这一方针相违背的各种不正确的思想，提高了领导骨干的认识。随后，各级党的组织在广大干部和群众中，深入地传达和宣传了市党代表大会的精神，组织干部认真学习了有关文件，不少单位并且以“要不要支援农业”、
  “能不能支援农业”、“是主动支援还是消极等待”、“是长期支援还是权宜之计”为题，展开了大辩论。经过这一系列的工作，使国民经济以农业为基础的方针更加深入人心，支援农业的群众运动便迅速地开展起来。在运动发展过程中，我们又围绕各个时期的任务和针对干部与群众的思想情况，反复地进行了有关支援农业的宣传教育，保证了这一运动步步深入。特别是在党中央发出全党动手大办农业，大办粮食的号召以后，通过对有关文件的深入学习，全体干部对国民经济以农业为基础的方针的认识更加提高了，从而掀起了一个更大规模的城市支援农村、工业支援农业的高潮。在短短一个多月的时间内，仅两个区、五个企业就制造各种脱谷机九百五十五台，仅两个区九个企业就支援公社二十八台机床、一千三百多件工具。现在，以支援秋收为中心的“百厂、千台、万具”的群众运动正在轰轰烈烈地开展着。
    市党代表大会以后，各工矿企业和其他支援农业的单位，都组织了访问团，到被支援的县、社进行参观访问。吉林化学工业公司及所属单位，组织下乡访问的次数有十五次之多。中共吉林市船营区委和所属工厂的绝大多数领导同志，都到农村访问过。城市的干部到农村参观访问，不仅了解了农村的情况和需要，使支援工作更加切合农村的实际情况，而且也受到了一次实际的、生动的以农业为基础的教育。许多同志反映，访问农村的次数越多，对农村的感情越深厚，支援农业的劲头越足。每访问一次农村，支援工作就深入一步。市木器厂原来以为自己是生产木器家具的工厂，对农业没有什么可支援的，到公社访问以后，他们认识到可以支援的事情太多了，于是就帮助公社盖了十五间房子，帮助盘石县木器厂实现了锯木机械化，并且抽出四十名木工支援公社制造脱谷工具。最近，他们还准备生产各种木农具，使工厂的生产面向农村。某工厂机械制造场主任，过去认为自己的生产任务已经很重，再支援农业就会打乱生产计划，对工厂布置的支援农业任务，迟迟不做安排。工人在业余时间生产了一些农具，他还批评工人“随便揽活”，所以工人管他叫“绊脚主任”。他参加工厂组织的访问团到挂钩公社访问时，看到农村迫切需要机械设备和新式农具，态度就完全转变了，回厂后把支援农业的任务列入作业计划，仅用两天的时间就完成了积压一个多月的农业机械修配任务。由于到农村访问对提高干部的思想具有如此巨大的作用，因此，许多单位把到农村访问定为固定的制度。比如，船营区委就规定区一级和厂一级的领导干部，如无特殊情况，每月都要到挂钩公社访问一次。广大干部也把农村人民公社看成是最好的“学校”，积极要求到挂钩公社去“走亲戚”、受教育。
    吉林地区工业比重很大，目前，工业人口和农业人口的比例已达一比零点九四。工业的飞跃发展要求农业必须相应地发展，而发展农业生产必须有工业和各行各业的全力支援。因此，我们今后必须进一步贯彻执行党的发展国民经济以农业为基础的方针，不断地提高全体干部和广大群众对这一方针的认识，把支援农业的群众运动不断地推向前进，以便在一个比较短的时期内逐步实现农业的技术改造，促进农业生产更迅速地向前发展。
