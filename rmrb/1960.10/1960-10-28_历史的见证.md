    Historical Witness
    Gao Han
    On the tenth anniversary of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, we watched the documentary "Historical Witness" produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, which made us relive the fervent mood stirred in everyone's heart by the vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea ten years ago, and the various momentous historical events we have personally experienced in the past decade.

    "Historical Witness" uses only a few shots to summarize the historical background of the outbreak of the Korean War. It allows us to look back at the extremely grim fact that faced the people of the world ten years ago: while a series of newly emerging socialist countries were busy with domestic construction, U.S. imperialism was busy manufacturing tanks and cannons, and supported two bellicose militarist countries—West Germany and Japan—on the flanks of the socialist countries. The people of the world watched with vigilant eyes: Imperialism would cause a war of aggression to break out in one place. The film shows us that in June 1950, the war-monger Dulles, like a black devil, came to the 38th parallel in Korea, and together with American officers, pointed and gesticulated on Korean soil. Seven days later, the gunfire of the Korean War sounded. History once again warned the people of the world: As long as we live on the same planet as imperialism, we must always be wary of the scourge of war? Look, aren't those American bombs being dropped on the beautiful land of Korea, and the wealth of the Korean people is burning along with their blood; our sacred territory of Taiwan has begun to fall into the clutches of U.S. imperialism; the peace of the Far East has been destroyed by the plague god Dulles!

    The film clearly and distinctly shows the stages of the war's development. Of course, this is by no means a scholar narrating history from a cold, bystander's perspective; it is a soldier writing his own struggle with boiling blood. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, the Korean people drove the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, the reactionary army of Syngman Rhee, to the southern end of the Korean Peninsula in one breath. U.S. imperialism, shamelessly, used the banner of the United Nations to gather the armies of fifteen vassal states and launched a large-scale counterattack. Relying on their "steel advantage," they cut a bloody path in northern Korea, deployed troops on the Yalu River, and dropped bombs all the way to the gate of our Northeast—Andong. The film clearly exposes the sinister intentions of U.S. imperialism: to follow the old path of Japanese imperialism, using Korea as a beachhead to peep into our country, in order to strangle the newborn People's Republic of China in its cradle. At this time, the film shows us our people, one by one, filled with indignation, rubbing their fists and wiping their palms. Then, we heard the marching song "Valiantly and spiritedly, we cross the Yalu River..." Its generous, majestic, and steady melody leads the emotion expressed in the film, that of being unable to endure any longer, to a vast battlefield in a torrent. The Chinese People's Volunteers crossed the river and, together with the Korean People's Army, gave the American invading army, which was still complacent, a head-on blow, driving them back across the Chongchon River with lightning speed; five consecutive major campaigns pushed them back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, the starting point of their war of aggression, causing U.S. imperialism to exchange a shameful "standstill" for the heavy price of 220,000 casualties. The war situation was reversed, the foundation for victory was laid, and the myth of the invincibility of the U.S. military was shattered. The Chinese and Korean soldiers were hailed by progressive mankind all over the world, because they used their blood to cultivate the flowers of peace in the Far East and the world.

    The film recorded a piece of news that was a first for U.S. imperialism: the once invincible American general had no choice but to wave a white flag and go to Kaesong to participate in armistice negotiations. But the film exposes that the U.S. imperialist elements, who are addicted to aggression, even when in the shameful position of a defeated general, still do not change their bandit hearts in the slightest, and are always trying to obtain at the negotiating table what they could not obtain on the battlefield. All this proves to us the most important truth in the contemporary world: the nature of imperialism will never become kind because of changes in objective conditions. The film narrates the despicable acts of U.S. imperialism, which went from war to peace talks and then from peace talks to war three times in succession, and then tells us that only when we launched a powerful summer offensive in 1953, and let the cunning American invading army suffer enough from the counterattack of the Chinese and Korean people, did they reluctantly sit down and sign the armistice agreement. The film allows us to see the real scene of this greatest victory for the people of the whole world, but the most shameful defeat for imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. The film also quotes the confession of the American General Clark, who signed the armistice agreement, in his later book "From the Danube to the Yalu River": "I executed the government's instructions and gained an unenviable reputation. I was the first American commander to sign a negotiation agreement without achieving victory." The film again uses irrefutable historical facts to prove another most important truth in the contemporary world: peace cannot be obtained by begging, but must be obtained by the struggle of the broad masses of the people.

    The film uses vivid images to analyze the reasons why this war ended with the victory of the Chinese and Korean people and the complete defeat of U.S. imperialism. Through Park Jae-geun and Luo Shengjiao, we saw the internationalist spirit of the people of China and Korea, and their unbreakable unity in life and death; through Li Shoufu and Huang Jiguang, we saw the invincibility of the people of the two countries. All of this was not surprising for the people who were armed with patriotism and internationalism under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist Party. Through the American officer using the butt of a gun to hit the heel of the American soldier, so that he took a step forward, and seeing our soldiers, they either knelt down to surrender or fled in panic, we saw the corrupt morale of the imperialist invading army; through those American soldiers who knelt on the battlefield with the priest to pray to God to bless them, we saw how empty the hearts of the U.S. imperialist invading army were! All of this is equally unsurprising for the reactionary army hired with money. In this way, the film reveals another most important truth in the contemporary world with vivid and typical images. This is what Chairman Mao said to an American reporter fourteen years ago: "All reactionaries are paper tigers."

    "Historical Witness" does not end here. It profoundly shows that after the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from Korea, U.S. imperialism continued to undermine the armistice agreement, continued to train the South Korean army, and continued to invade our territory of Taiwan. It proves that the extremely difficult and extremely complex anti-aggression and anti-imperialist struggle has not ended. However, it foreshadows us with convincing images that the storm against U.S. imperialism, initiated by the people of the whole world, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, is rising on a large scale. It is not the seemingly powerful but actually empty U.S. imperialism and its followers who are the masters of the world, but only the great proletariat and the working people of the world.

    历史的见证
    高汉
    在抗美援朝十周年的时候，我们看到了中央新闻纪录电影制片厂的纪录片《历史的见证》，使我们重温了十年以前如火如荼的抗美援朝运动在每个人心里所激荡起来的那种激愤的心情，和这十年来我们亲身经历过的种种巨大的历史事变。
    《历史的见证》用不多几个镜头概括了爆发朝鲜战争的历史背景。它让我们回顾到十年以前那个摆在世界人民面前的、极为严峻的事实：当一系列新兴的社会主义国家正在忙于国内建设的时候，美帝国主义却忙于制造坦克和大炮，并在社会主义国家的两翼，扶持了两个好战的军国主义国家——西德和日本。世界人民都以警惕的眼光注视着：帝国主义将使侵略战争在一个地方爆发。影片让我们看到：1950年6月，战争贩子杜勒斯，像一个黑色的魔鬼，来到了朝鲜三八线，和美国军官一起，在朝鲜的土地上指手划脚。七天以后，朝鲜战争的枪声打响了。历史再一次向世界人民发出警告：只要是和帝国主义生活在同一个星球上，就必须时刻提防战祸？你看，那不就是美国的炸弹被掷到朝鲜美丽的国土上，朝鲜人民的财富和着血液一起燃烧；我国神圣的领土台湾开始落入美帝国主义的魔爪；远东的和平被瘟神杜勒斯破坏！
    影片步骤分明地表现了战争发展的段落。当然，这决不是一个学究在以冷眼旁观者的身份叙述历史；这是一个战士在用沸腾的血液书写自己的斗争。在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅的领导下，朝鲜人民一口气就把美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚的反动军队赶到朝鲜半岛的南端。美帝国主义恬不知耻，居然打起联合国的旗帜，纠集了十五个仆从国家的军队，大举反扑。他们自恃“钢铁优势”，在朝鲜北部杀开血路，陈兵鸭绿江，把炸弹一直掷到我国东北的大门——安东。影片昭然揭露了美帝国主义的祸心：走日本帝国主义的老路，以朝鲜为滩头阵地，进窥我国，以便把新生的中华人民共和国掐死在襁褓之中。这时候，影片让我们看到了我国人民一个个气愤填胸，磨拳擦掌。接着，我们耳边响起了“雄赳赳，气昂昂，跨过鸭绿江……”的进行曲。它以慷慨雄浑沉着的旋律，把影片所表现出来的那种忍无可忍的情绪，一泻千里地引向一个广阔的战场。中国人民志愿军过江了，和朝鲜人民军一起，给正在得意忘形的美国侵略军当头一棒，以迅雷不及掩耳之势，一直把他们赶过清川江；连续五次大战役，把他们压回发动侵略战争的起点三八线附近，使美帝国主义以被歼二十二万的惨重代价，换得了一个可耻的“原地踏步”。战局扭转了，胜利的基础奠定了，美军不可战胜的神话破裂了。中朝战士受到了全世界进步人类的欢呼，因为他们用鲜血培育远东和世界和平的花朵。
    影片纪录了对美帝国主义来说还是破题儿第一遭的新闻：曾经是不可一世的美国将军，居然也只好打着白旗到开城参加停战谈判。但是影片揭露了侵略成性的美帝国主义分子，即使处在败军之将的可耻地位上，仍然分毫不改他们的强盗心肠，一味企图在谈判桌上取到在战场上无法取得的东西。这一切向我们证明了一个当代世界上最重要的真理：帝国主义的本性决不会因为客观条件的改变而变得善良起来。影片叙述了美帝国主义先后三次由战争而和谈，又由和谈而战争的反复无常的卑劣行径之后，告诉我们，只有当我们在1953年发动了强大的夏季攻势，让狡诈的美国侵略军吃够中朝人民反击他们的苦头以后，才无可奈何地坐下来在停战协定上签字。影片让我们看到这一场对全世界人民来说是最伟大的胜利，但是对帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义来说是最可耻的失败的真实情景。影片中还引用了在停战协定上签字的美国将军克拉克在他自己后来写的《从多瑙河到鸭绿江》一书中的招供：“我执行政府的指示，获得了一个不值得羡慕的名望，我是第一个在没有取得胜利的谈判协定上签字的美国司令官。”影片又以无可辩驳的史实论证了另一个当代世界上最重要的真理：和平不能依靠乞讨获取，而必须依靠广大人民的斗争获取。
    影片用鲜明的形象分析了这场战争之所以以中朝人民获胜和以美帝国主义彻底失败告终的原因。通过朴在根和罗盛教，我们看到了中朝两国人民的国际主义精神，和生死与共的团结无间；通过李寿福和黄继光，我们看到了两国人民的英勇无敌。这一切，对在马克思列宁主义的党的领导下，用爱国主义和国际主义武装起来的人民来说，原是不足为奇的。通过美国军官用枪托子砸那个美国兵的脚跟，他才前进一步，和见到我方战士之后，他们如不是下跪投降就豕突狼奔的镜头，我们看到了帝国主义侵略军的败坏的士气；通过那些跟着牧师跪在战场上祷告上帝保佑的美军，我们看到了美帝国主义侵略军的心灵是何等的空虚！这一切，对于用金钱雇佣来的反动军队来说，同样是不足为奇的。就这样，影片用生动典型的形象，揭示了当代世界上又一个最重要的真理。这就是十四年前毛主席亲口对一个美国记者说的：“一切反动派都是纸老虎”。
    《历史的见证》并没有就此结束。它发人深思地表现了中国人民志愿军撤离朝鲜以后，美帝国主义却仍然在不停地破坏停战协定，继续训练南朝鲜军队，继续侵占我国领土台湾。它证明了极其艰苦、极其复杂的反侵略、反帝国主义斗争并没有就此结束。不过，它以令人信服的形象预示我们，全世界，特别是亚、非、拉丁美洲人民所掀起的反对美帝国主义的风暴，正在大规模地兴起。作为世界的主人的，决不是貌似强大、实则空虚的美帝国主义及其追随者，而只能是伟大的无产阶级和全世界的劳动人民。（附图片）
