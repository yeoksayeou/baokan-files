Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The East German Democratic Republic National People's Army men's handball team, which has world-class ability, played its final friendly match in China today at the Beijing Xianongtan Stadium. They narrowly defeated the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" men's handball team by a score of 11 to 10.

This friendly match was tense and fierce from beginning to end, with the score tied three times. The visiting team secured the final victory with only five seconds left in the game, when forward Papst powerfully shot the ball into the net on an indirect free kick.

The "August 1st" handball team (the champion being the Anhui team), which won second place in the Chongqing competition area of this year's national handball division championships, played actively and tenaciously against their strong opponents today, contesting every ball. In particular, they adopted a tight man-to-man marking defensive tactic, making it difficult for the visiting team to execute their favored quick offensive tactics.

    德人民军男子手球队举行最后一场友谊赛
    新华社16日讯　具有世界水平的德意志民主共和国国家人民军男子手球队，今天在北京先农坛体育场举行访华最后一场友谊比赛时，以十一比十仅多一分的优势战胜了中国人民解放军“八一”男子手球队。
    这场友谊比赛自始至终紧张激烈，曾三次打成平局，客队是在比赛还剩最后五秒钟时，由前卫帕普施利用罚间接任意球的机会，劲射一球入网，才奠定了最后的胜利。
    获得今年全国手球分区锦标赛重庆竞赛区亚军的“八一”手球队（冠军是安徽队），今天在强劲的对手面前打得积极顽强，每球必争，特别是采用了紧逼人盯人的防守战术，使客队很难打出他们擅长的快速进攻战术。“八一”队在进攻时也采用了掩护、交叉换位和个人突破等多变的战术，获得多次射门机会，因而同拥有世界冠军队选手的客队始终保持接近的比分。
    中国人民解放军总政治部副主任萧华上将，国家体委副主任李达、黄中，以及张池明中将、彭嘉庆中将、段德彰海军少将、韩复东大校等，在观看了今天的友谊赛后，都到运动场上同双方队员一一握手，并在一起合影。
