One Jin of Ammonium Nitrate, Five Jin of Grain

Good Model Worker of Jilin Chemical Industrial Company

Coal Gas Generator Operator of Jilin Fertilizer Plant  Sun Shushan

I am a worker who produces chemical fertilizer. The Party has repeatedly educated us that workers and peasants are one family, and supporting agriculture is the glorious responsibility of the working class. This year, the employees of our factory put forward the ambitious goal of turning one factory into three, determined to produce more fertilizer to support the great leap forward in agriculture. Recently, the factory Party committee also mobilized the masses to formulate a plan for increasing production and practicing economy. Everyone is very enthusiastic and determined to increase fertilizer production on the basis of ensuring the completion of the state plan, and contribute to agricultural production.

In our fertilizer plant, the coal gas generator is a key point, and we call this position the lifeline of the entire plant. I am the operator of the No. 1 coal gas generator and deeply know the importance of my responsibility. On the day I entered the factory in 1956, the veteran master told me: "Young man, this is not an ordinary position. If we are a little careless, thousands of kilograms of grain will be gone." My family has been farmers for generations, so how can I not know the value of grain. One jin of ammonium nitrate can increase grain production by five jin, which is no small matter. Since then, I have diligently learned operating experience from veteran masters and operated carefully. In the past four years, no accidents have occurred. Everyone calls me a safe operator. In fact, without the education of the Party and the collaborative operation of everyone, what can I do by myself? Take the three-shift operation as an example. If the previous shift doesn't create conditions for me, I will have problems no matter how capable I am. Our working class has this style. After I go to work, I pay special attention to creating conditions for the next shift, so that the comrades taking over can save worry and effort, and achieve stable and high output. Once it was really tense. Due to the poor activity of the coal, production was abnormal for several days. No. 2 and No. 3 furnaces formed scabs, and my No. 1 furnace was also very difficult to operate. I thought: In order to support agriculture, I must not be careless. For several days in a row, I concentrated on operating, and No. 1 furnace did not form scabs after all, and got through the difficult time.

Now, our factory is carrying out a mass campaign to produce ammonia. I am determined to further stabilize operations, carefully check, strengthen the maintenance of equipment, ensure that no accidents occur, guard the first major gate of the entire factory's production, and produce more and better fertilizers to support our farmer brothers and produce more grain.

    一斤硝铵五斤粮食
    吉林化学工业公司十好标兵
    吉林肥料厂煤气发生炉操作工  孙树山
    我是一个生产化学肥料的工人。党一再教育我们：工人农民是一家人，支援农业是工人阶级的光荣责任。今年，我们厂职工提出一厂变三厂的雄心壮志，下定决心要多多地生产化肥，支援农业大跃进。最近，厂党委又发动群众，制订增产节约计划。大伙的干劲可足啦，决心在保证完成国家计划的基础上，多增产化肥，为农业生产出力。
    在我们肥料厂，煤气发生炉是个关键，我们都把这个岗位叫作全厂的命脉。我是一号煤气发生炉的操作工，深知自己责任的重大。1956年我进厂那一天，老师傅就告诉我：“小伙子，这可不是个平常的岗位啊，咱要稍一马虎，几千斤粮食就没有了。”我家祖祖辈辈都是庄稼人，怎不知粮食的宝贵。一斤硝铵，可以增产五斤粮，这可不是一件小事情。从那以后，我就用心向老师傅学习操作经验，精心操作，四年来，没有发生任何事故。大家叫我是保险操作工，其实，没有党的教育和大家的协同操作，我自己能干个啥。就拿三班操作来说吧，上一班要不给我创造条件，我有天大的本事也会出毛病。咱们工人阶级就是有这个风格。我上班后，也就特别留心给下班创造条件，叫接班的同志能省心省力，稳定高产。有一回可真紧张，由于煤的活性不好，一连几天生产不正常，二号和三号炉结了疤，我操作的一号炉也很吃力。我想：为了支援农业，说啥也不能马虎。一连几天，我都集中精力操作，一号炉到底没有结疤，闯过了难关。
    现在，我们厂正在开展套氨大会战，我决心进一步稳定操作，仔细检查，加强对设备的维护，保证不出任何事故，把守好全厂生产的第一大关，生产出更多更好的肥料，支援农民兄弟，多打粮食。
