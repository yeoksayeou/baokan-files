    Eavesdropping
    Poem by Tian Ma, Painting by Jiang Fan
    Reportedly: The American spy group installed equipment to eavesdrop on conversations at the Xinhua News Agency's Havana branch. Two of the spies were employees of the US Embassy in Cuba. Nominally employees, also serving as spies, espionage and diplomacy, linked by a dark thread. Eavesdropping on people’s conversations, ears perked up, to carry out conspiracies, disregarding all decency! Every sentence is the truth, spread throughout the five continents, what's the use of eavesdropping? It only breaks your nerve—China and Cuba, though separated by ten thousand miles, have deep friendship, united on the anti-imperialist front. Six hundred million Chinese people, admire heroic men: opposing the American devils, anger burns in their "backyard"! China and Cuba established diplomatic relations, friendship further progressed, cheers soar ten thousand miles, praised throughout the world…The shock has not yet settled, the claws are severed, the evidence and the perpetrator are both present, silenced and dare not speak!

    偷听
    天马诗  江帆画
    报载：美国间谍集团安装设备偷听新华社哈瓦那分社的谈话。其中两名间谍是美国驻古巴大使馆的职员。名义是职员，又把间谍兼，间谍与外交，一条黑线穿。偷听人说话，耳朵放的尖，为了搞阴谋，顾得啥体面！句句是真理，五洲都传遍，偷听有何用？反而惊破胆——中国和古巴，虽距万里远，人民情谊深，反帝一条线。六亿中国人，钦慕英雄汉：反对美国佬，怒火烧“后院”！中古建了交，友谊更进展，欢声腾万里，四海皆称赞……惊魂还未定，魔爪被斩断，人赃两俱在，闭口不敢言！（附图片）
