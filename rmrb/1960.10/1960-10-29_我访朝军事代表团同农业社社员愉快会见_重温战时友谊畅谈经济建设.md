Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 27th: The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea, led by Marshal He Long and General Luo Ruiqing, had a pleasant meeting today with members of the "China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative" in Sunan County, South Pyongan Province, Korea.

Today, the sky was high, the clouds were light, and the weather was pleasant. The national flags of China and Korea fluttered in the wind. The members of the "China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative" were celebrating a festival, cleaning everywhere and wearing brightly colored clothes. When the delegation, accompanied by senior generals of the Korean People's Army, entered the village, the members raised the national flags of China and Korea and bouquets of flowers, carrying large banners reading "Long Live Marshal Kim Il-sung!" "Long Live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long Live the Militant Friendship Between the People of Korea and China, Who Are as Close as Flesh and Blood!" The crowd lined the streets to welcome their Chinese relatives. In front of the welcoming crowd, a poster depicting the Chinese and Korean armies fighting side by side and triumphantly joining forces, and Chinese and Korean farmers hand in hand, was particularly eye-catching.

Li Zongchun, the chairman of the agricultural cooperative and a Hero of Labor of the Republic, said at the mass meeting to welcome the delegation that all the members were particularly happy today to welcome the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea led by Marshal He Long and General Luo Ruiqing. He said that the internationalist friendship and unity forged between the people of Korea and China had been further consolidated through the common struggle against the US imperialist aggressors. The contributions made by the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers together with our People's Army on our land will forever remain in our memories and will be passed on to our future generations.

Marshal He Long spoke to the cheering and applauding members. He said that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic Government headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, Korean farmers had achieved comprehensive collectivization in the short span of four or five years after the war, and then, at the speed of Chollima, had basically achieved water conservancy and electrification in a very short time. Now, with the support of the state and industrial departments, they are vigorously promoting agricultural mechanization. This year's agriculture has reaped a bumper harvest, and your lives are becoming happier and better every day. Comrade Luo Ruiqing and all the comrades of the delegation and I would like to extend our congratulations to you, and through you to all the Korean farmers.

Marshal He Long said: The people of China and Korea are as close as brothers. We are closely united and fighting side by side in the common struggle against imperialist aggression; in the common cause of building socialism, we support and learn from each other. The friendship between our two peoples, forged in blood, is extremely profound, evergreen, and unbreakable. The China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative has a particularly close and friendly relationship with the Chinese people. During the war, the Chinese People's Volunteer units stationed here established a close fighting friendship with you, and after the war, they participated in construction with you. Whether in the difficult war years or in the post-war period, the stationed units of the Volunteer Army have always received strong support from you in all aspects and have been given meticulous care. The Chinese people regard your support and care as a manifestation of lofty internationalist friendship.

Marshal He Long said that in 1958, our Premier Zhou Enlai visited your agricultural cooperative, and many Chinese delegations visiting Korea also often come here for friendly visits. The rice seeds sent by your cooperative to the Chinese people have already produced the first batch of fruits of friendship in the rice fields of the "China-Korea Friendship Commune" in Beijing.

Marshal He Long concluded by saying that there is no end to the stories of China-Korea friendship in the China-Korea Friendship Cooperative and the stories of friendship between the people of China and Korea. Because the friendship between our two peoples has taken root in the hearts of the broad masses of the people, its strength is infinite. We believe that this friendship will be further consolidated and developed in the future.

The delegation visited a threshing ground, where piles of rice were like mountains, and three threshing machines were whirring. Marshal He Long picked up an ear of rice and counted it, there were one hundred and fifty-five grains, and smiled to the people next to him, "You also look, very good."

When the delegation left, they presented gifts to the agricultural cooperative. In addition, Marshal He Long presented a gift to Cui Shilie, a sixty-seven-year-old family member of a revolutionary martyr. Marshal He Long shook the old lady's hand and said, "You are two years older than me, I wish you good health." The old lady was so excited that tears welled up in her eyes and said, "Thanks to the care of the Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, we live very well." Marshal He Long said, "Yes. I hope you will live even better in the future."

According to the introduction of Chairman Li Zongchun, this cooperative was established in December 1953 by twelve households of martyrs' families (poor peasants). Now it has developed into a large-scale cooperative including seven hundred and fifty-six households, totaling more than one thousand five hundred people. Its material and technical foundation is also strong. This year, it has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, averaging more than four tons of rice per hectare, two thousand five hundred kilograms of corn, and two thousand one hundred kilograms of cotton. The chairman said that the whole cooperative now has one thousand one hundred and sixty-two hectares of land, three hundred and twenty-seven cattle, six hundred and seventy-one pigs, thirteen tractors, sixty-five threshing machines, two trucks, and six carts. There are no more illiterate people in the whole cooperative, and there are currently three hundred and fifty students with a middle school education or above. There are clinics, kindergartens, nurseries, bathhouses, wired broadcasting, clubs, etc. in the cooperative.

    我访朝军事代表团同农业社社员愉快会见
    重温战时友谊畅谈经济建设
    新华社平壤27日电　由贺龙元帅、罗瑞卿大将率领的中国访朝军事友好代表团，今天同朝鲜平安南道顺安郡“朝中友谊农业合作社”的社员们进行了愉快的会见。
    今天，天高云淡，气候宜人，中朝两国国旗迎风飘扬。“朝中友谊农业合作社”的社员们像过节一样，处处打扫得干干净净，人人穿着鲜艳的服装。当代表团在朝鲜人民军高级将领陪同下走进村口时，社员们高举中朝两国国旗和花束，抬着写有“金日成元帅万岁！”“毛泽东主席万岁！”“血肉相连的朝中两国人民之间的战斗友谊万岁！”的大幅标语牌，夹道欢迎中国亲人。在欢迎人群的正面，一幅画着朝中两国军队并肩作战胜利会师、朝中两国农民手挽手的招贴画，格外引人注意。
    农业社社长、共和国劳动英雄李宗淳在欢迎代表团的群众大会上讲话说，全体社员今天欢迎贺龙元帅、罗瑞卿大将率领的中国访朝军事友好代表团，心里感到特别高兴。他说，朝中两国人民之间所结成的国际主义友谊团结，通过反对美帝国主义侵略者的共同斗争，更加巩固了。中国人民志愿军官兵们同我们人民军一起在我们的土地上建立的功勋，将永远留在我们的记忆中，并将传给我们的子孙万代。
    贺龙元帅对热烈欢呼和鼓掌的社员们讲了话。他说，朝鲜农民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，在战后短短四、五年的时间内，实现了全面合作化，后来，又以千里马的速度，在很短的时间里，基本上实现了水利化和电气化。现在，正在国家和工业部门的支援下，大力促进农业机械化。今年的农业获得了丰收，你们的生活正在一天天变得更加幸福和美好。我和罗瑞卿同志与代表团的全体同志特向你们、并通过你们向全体朝鲜农民表示祝贺。
    贺龙元帅说：中朝两国人民亲如兄弟。在反对帝国主义侵略的共同斗争中我们紧密团结，并肩作战；在建设社会主义的共同事业中，又互相支援，互相学习。我们两国人民之间以鲜血凝成的友谊是无比深厚的，是万古长青、牢不可破的。朝中友谊农业社，同中国人民有着特别亲密友好的关系。战争时期，驻在这里的中国人民志愿军部队曾同你们建立了亲密的战斗友谊，战后时期又同你们一起参加建设。无论是在艰苦的战争年代，或者是在战后时期，志愿军的驻防部队，一直得到你们各方面的大力支持，并受到你们无微不至的关怀和照顾。中国人民把你们这些支援和关怀，看作是国际主义的崇高友情的表现。
    贺龙元帅说，1958年，我国周恩来总理曾访问过你们的农业社，我国访问朝鲜的许多代表团，也经常到你们这里来进行友好探望。你们合作社送给中国人民的稻种，已经在北京“中朝友谊公社”的稻田里结下了第一批友谊的果实。
    贺龙元帅最后说，朝中友谊社里的中朝友谊故事和中朝两国人民的友谊故事是说不完的。因为我们两国人民的友谊是在广大人民群众的心中生了根的，它的力量是无穷无尽的。我们相信，这种友谊在今后必将得到进一步的巩固和发展。
    代表团参观了一个脱谷场，场上稻堆如山，三台脱谷机哗啦啦响。贺龙元帅拿起一株稻穗数了数，有一百五十五个粒，笑着对旁边的人说：“你也看看，很好。”
    代表团离开时，向农业社赠送了礼品。另外，贺龙元帅把一份礼品赠送给了六十七岁的革命烈属崔史烈老妈妈。贺龙元帅握着老妈妈的手说：“你比我大两岁，我祝你健康。”老妈妈激动得热泪盈眶说：“由于劳动党和金日成首相的关怀，我们生活得很好。”贺龙元帅说：“对。希望您今后生活得更好。”
    根据李宗淳社长的介绍，这个合作社是在1953年12月由十二户烈士家属（贫农）组成的，现在已经发展到包括七百五十六户、共一千五百多人的大规模的合作社，它的物资技术基础也雄厚了，今年获得了史无前例的大丰收，平均一公顷水稻收四吨多，玉米收二千五百公斤，棉花收二千一百公斤。社长说，全社现有一千一百六十二公顷土地，三百二十七头牛，六百七十一口猪，十三台拖拉机，六十五台脱谷机，两辆汽车，六辆推车。全社已经没有文盲，现有三百五十个中学以上水平的学生。社内有诊疗所、幼儿园、托儿所、澡堂、有线广播、俱乐部等。
