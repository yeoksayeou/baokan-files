    AFL-CIO Monthly Report Admits
    U.S. Economy is on the "Brink of Recession"
    Unemployment to Exceed Five Million in Next Three Months
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) The recently published American labor union publication, the AFL-CIO Monthly Report, admits that the U.S. economy is currently on the "brink of recession."
    The AFL-CIO Monthly Report says that one-twelfth of America's industrial production capacity is not being utilized, and the operating rate of the steel industry is only half. It also states that, according to past experience, labor force employment usually improves in the autumn. But this year, this has not occurred. According to the Monthly Report's estimates, the number of unemployed in the United States may exceed five million in the next three months.

    本报讯　最近出版的美国工会刊物劳联—产联月报承认，美国经济目前已经处在“衰退的边缘”。
    劳联—产联月报说，现在美国的工业生产能力有十二分之一没有得到利用，而其中钢铁工业的开工率只有一半。它还说，按照过去情况，劳动力的就业通常在秋季会有所改善。但今年却没有出现这种情况。据月报估计，美国今后三个月的失业人数可能超过五百万。
