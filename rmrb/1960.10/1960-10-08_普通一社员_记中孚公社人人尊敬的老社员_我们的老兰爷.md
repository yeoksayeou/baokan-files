	Ordinary Commune Member
	Remembering Old Team Member Mu Youlan, Respected by Everyone in Zhongfu Commune – "Our Old Lan-ye"
	Zhang Xin, Ming Zhi, Sheng Ru, Guo Nan

	"Our Old Lan-ye!" What an affectionate and respectable title this is! Mu Youlan, an old man of sixty-eight, is selfless, adheres to principles, dares to speak and act, and wholeheartedly devotes himself to the collective cause... He is the true master of the People's Commune, a model worthy of great praise and emulation!

		If There's Something to Say, He'll Say It; If There's Something to Manage, He'll Manage It

	In the Hongliu Production Team of the Zhongfu People's Commune in Lintao County, Gansu Province, there is a sixty-eight-year-old commune member named Mu Youlan. Whether they are cadres or commune members, everyone respectfully and affectionately calls him "Our Old Lan-ye!"

	Lan-ye is not a team cadre, but he wants to inquire about everything big and small in the team, and every commune member is willing to obey his guidance. This spring plowing season, one day Lan-ye passed by the field plowed by commune member Mu Jiming and found that the surface of the field was a layer of loose soil, but there was a lot of hardened soil underneath. Lan-ye immediately criticized Mu Jiming and asked him to plow again. But Mu Jiming was still arguing sophistically in his own defense. In order to educate Mu Jiming, he called several commune members who were plowing at the same time and, in front of everyone, peeled open the loose soil on the surface of the field, and the hardened soil was exposed in chunks. Mu Jiming had nothing to say at this point. Lan-ye pointed to the hardened soil and said, "Kid, who are you trying to fool? People fool the land, the land fools the belly. If the land is not plowed well, the crops will not grow well. If the team can't harvest grain, everyone will have nothing to eat. Isn't that just fooling yourself?" These few words made Mu Jiming very ashamed. He admitted that he had done things wrong, and said that from now on, he would treat the team's affairs as his own and do them conscientiously and responsibly. He also plowed the hardened land again.

	Lan-ye is not a feeder, but he goes to the feeding farm several times a day. When he sees the pen is wet, he pads it with soil; when the trough is not clean, he sweeps it; when the livestock is dirty, he washes it; when a pregnant animal is about to give birth, he stays with it all night long. Last winter, the livestock of the Second Team were not fed well. The feeder who had been criticized was disheartened and cried that he would not do it anymore. Lan-ye moved his bedding to the feeding farm that afternoon to help the feeder feed the livestock. In the feeding farm, some livestock had big mouths and some had small mouths, and they ate grass at different speeds. In the past, when the feeder added feed, he added it to the trough and left it alone. As a result, some livestock could not grab feed and became thinner and thinner. Lan-ye changed this method so that every animal could eat the same amount of feed. He got up three times every night to add grass to the livestock, and each time he added grass, he cleaned the bottom of the trough. After more than a month of careful feeding, the fourteen livestock of the Second Team became fat and strong and were all rated as first class. The feeder also smiled and decided to settle down and take care of the livestock like Old Lan-ye.

	Lan-ye is not a herdsman, but he is also very concerned about the team's sheep. Last winter, there were many wolves. He was afraid that the wolves would hurt the sheep, so he went around the sheepfold several times every night, regardless of wind or snow. Ewes successively gave birth to winter lambs. Some weaned lambs could not keep up with the flock, and no one took care of them when they were left in the fold. So he vacated a room in his house, brought the lambs in, fed them grass and water during the day, and made a fire to keep them warm at night. In just over four months, he fed and raised more than twenty lambs until they were fat and large and could keep up with the flock.

	Lan-ye is not a canteen manager, nor is he a cook, but since the establishment of the canteen in 1958, he has grown one or two mu of vegetables for the canteen every year. He plows, sows, and manages them himself. Like other commune members, Old Lan-ye also has a few plots of private land, but he did not put as much effort into managing them as he did the canteen's vegetable plots. All year round, he always has a manure basket in his hand. Every time he picks up manure, he applies it to these vegetable plots. Last year, he harvested 20,000 jin of cabbage, peppers, and eggplants from the one mu he planted, which added a large amount of fresh vegetables to the canteen.

	Old Lan-ye goes wherever he can do something, and he does whatever he sees. When he finds something done wrong or something said wrong, he makes suggestions. Some people in the village once said, "How many more days can the old man live? What is he trying to do by pointing fingers!" Old Lan-ye said, "I am not asking for merit or reward! I am doing it for everyone. Even if I die tomorrow morning, I will still say and manage things tonight!"

		Wholeheartedly

	One day in early spring this year, Old Lan-ye went to Zhongfu Street to buy door buckles for the livestock pen. After buying them, it was already dark, but he was not in a hurry to go back. As usual, he went to the office of the commune Party committee to sit for a while. He is Party Committee Secretary Sun Xirong's "agricultural advisor." Whenever he has time, he always tells the secretary about the production situation in the team. Coincidentally, the commune's cadres were in a meeting at this time, so Lan-ye asked, "What kind of meeting are you holding? Are you discussing national affairs? Can you let me listen too?" Sun Xirong readily agreed and welcomed him to participate.

	This meeting was to discuss drought resistance and production. Sun Xirong conveyed the instructions from higher authorities, pointing out that according to meteorological forecasts, a severe drought may occur this year. He asked everyone to actively respond to the call of the provincial Party committee and prepare for drought prevention and resistance work as soon as possible. Old Lan-ye remembered every word of the Party committee secretary in his heart. The possibility of a severe drought this year made him restless. He felt that he needed to tell the team soon so that they could prepare early. The meeting lasted until after ten o'clock at night. Regardless of the dark and the long road, he hurried home.

	He walked and thought. He remembered something from the great drought of 1929: That year, after practical research, he sowed wheat ten days early in four mu of land, sowing it close to the frozen soil. He used the moisture from the thawing of the soil to germinate and grow. Although it did not rain until more than forty days later, the wheat seedlings quickly recovered as soon as it rained. There was no rain for months in June and July, but his wheat was already ripe at this time. Old Lan-ye decided to talk about these old experiences.

	Lan-ye walked and thought. When he returned to Hongliu Village, it was already midnight. Without bothering to go home, he went straight to the team headquarters and told the Party branch secretary and the team leader everything he had heard at the commune and the ideas he had on the way. Finally, he said, "It didn't snow last winter, and it hasn't rained yet. I'm afraid there will be a major drought. Wheat is drought-resistant, so we should plant more this year. The 'Eighty-ninth Day' is coming soon, so we should start early." Party Branch Secretary Li Xilu fully agreed with Lan-ye's proposal. The next day, he convened a meeting of cadres and a meeting of commune members, introduced Lan-ye's experience, and decided to expand the wheat planting area to 2,100 mu, an increase of 90% compared to the previous year. They also decided to change the habit of sowing wheat on the "Ninety-ninth Day" and start plowing and sowing on the first day of the "Eighty-ninth Day."

	On the morning of the sowing day, Lan-ye went to the field before dawn. He first went to the Second Team and the Third Team, and then to the First Team. The sound of the seeders could be heard everywhere on the slopes and in the river valleys, and groups of commune members were driving mules and horses to plant the land. Seeing this, Lan-ye was extremely happy. He thought, "As long as everyone is united, we will definitely be able to overcome the drought and reap a good harvest." However, when he went to the Fourth Team, he couldn't see a single person. "What's going on?" He found team leader Li Tianyun and asked bluntly, "All the teams started sowing this morning. Why haven't you started sowing yet?" Li Tianyun first hesitated and said that the seeders hadn't been cleaned up yet, and then said that the old people thought it wasn't good to plant so early. Lan-ye was a little angry when he heard this. He said, "I think you just haven't thought it through. You are young and have little experience. The Party branch's decision is correct. You must trust the Party! Quickly drive the livestock to the field to plant!" After Li Tianyun promised to plant immediately, Lan-ye went to the home of the old man Li Zhongyi in the village. He knew from Li Tianyun's words that Li Zhongyi did not agree with early planting and had given him a bad idea. He found Li Zhongyi and tried to persuade and explain to him, saying, "The team's affairs are our own affairs. We are old and cannot do heavy work, nor can we exert great strength. As long as we guide young people onto the right path pointed out by the Party, we will have helped a little." After this effort, the Fourth Team also began planting wheat that afternoon.

	The production team concentrated all its manpower to rush to plant, and quickly planted the original 1,400 mu of land. Then they began sowing in the stubble fields and potato stubble fields. This part of the land was not originally planned to be planted with wheat and had not been harrowed in advance. The soil clods were large and there was a lot of dry soil. The people who had previously disagreed with early planting wavered again, thinking that this was a waste of seeds and still wanted to wait for the rain before planting. Lan-ye took the initiative to discuss with Party Branch Secretary Li Xilu and proposed to bring these people who couldn't think straight to the field, where he would set an example for everyone to see. The Party branch immediately convened an on-site meeting and asked Lan-ye to give a live demonstration. In front of everyone, Lan-ye broke up the soil clods on a potato stubble field and rolled them over. The dry soil went from seven inches to five inches, and below that was wet soil. He measured the wooden and iron plows of the seeder together, and they were exactly five inches. This way, the seeds could be planted on the wet soil. This completely convinced everyone. In this way, the Hongliu Production Team completed the sowing task of 2,100 mu of wheat ten days ahead of schedule this year. From the day the plowing and sowing began, there was no rain in the local area for more than forty consecutive days, and the land became even drier. But as the thawing caused moisture to rise, all the wheat seedlings emerged from the soil. People often say, "Seeing the seedlings is three-tenths of the harvest," and the commune members began to be grateful to Old Lan-ye. By early July, it was dry again. In previous years, this was the time when wheat was flowering and filling, and rain was urgently needed. But this year, the wheat in the entire team had already ripened at this time. Despite the drought this year, the Hongliu Production Team achieved a bumper harvest.

		Loves the Team More Than His Own Home

	Old Lan-ye pours all his energy into the affairs of the commune, worrying and working hard for everyone day and night. He often leaves the house before dawn and does not return until midnight. Even when it is cloudy and raining, he rarely stays at home. Someone joked, "Lan-ye, where is your home anyway?" He replied, "The commune is my home! Wherever I go, that's my home." In fact, Lan-ye loves the team more than his own home.

	One summer night, Lan-ye was sleeping when he was suddenly awakened by the rumble of thunder. A torrential rain was pouring down. He hurriedly put on his clothes and got out of bed to go out and block the flood from flowing into the fields. His wife hurriedly grabbed him and said, "It's so dark, what are you going to do in such a clumsy way?" He didn't listen and ran out with an iron shovel in his hand. At this time, it was so dark that he couldn't see his fingers. He slipped and fell, then got up again. His clothes were soaked, but he still insisted on diverting the flood into the fields with the commune members. Everyone advised him to go back, but he refused to do so. The fields were filled with floodwater. He was afraid that the banks would break and the water would run out, so he went around in the dark to check each field. Sure enough, there was a gap in the side of one field, and the floodwater was gushing out. He quickly shoveled soil to plug it, but it didn't work. He took off his cotton vest and pressed it on the opening, but it still didn't work. He thought, "One gap will cause gap after gap." So he jumped into the water without hesitation and lay down on the gap, using his body to block the flood until the commune members heard the sound and came to fill the gap. This time, most of the floodwater was intercepted and stored in the farmland, giving it a good soaking.

	This year, just when the wheat was about to ripen and weeding in the autumn fields was in full swing, the team's cadres had to go to the commune for a meeting. On the day of their departure, Party Branch Secretary Li Xilu found Lan-ye and said, "After we leave, we will have to ask you to worry more about the affairs at home." Lan-ye readily agreed, saying, "Just rest assured, I won't let any problems arise, big or small!"

	After Lan-ye sent the cadres away, he began to think about many problems in production and life. The more he thought, the heavier he felt the burden; the more he thought, the more he couldn't sit still. He hurriedly got up and left the team headquarters, first went to the fields of the First Team. Seeing that several mu of winter wheat were already ripe, he quickly found several work group leaders and held a meeting to organize the commune members to rush to harvest. This team had little labor and a large weeding task, so he went to the Second Team to mobilize and transferred more than a dozen people to help harvest wheat. After arranging things here, he went to the Third Team. He found that the weeding task here was very tight, so he discussed with the canteen and the cooks to send the meals to the fields, reducing the time for commune members to go back and forth to eat. By the time he had finished running through the five teams, the sun had already set, and he hadn't had lunch yet. After dinner, he called the militia to a meeting and arranged for night patrols to guard the wheat that was about to ripen. This day, he ran from morning to night without stopping. His legs were a little sore, and he really wanted to lie down and rest. But he remembered, "Young people are sleepy, and they are tired after working all day. Will they fall asleep in the fields?" Thinking of this, he got up again. When he got to the field, he saw bright lanterns moving around everywhere, but he was still not at ease. He groped in the dark to check the ditches and gullies where there were no lights. He heard the militia shouting in the darkness, and he was happy. By the time he had checked all the teams, the rooster had crowed for the first time.

	Lying on the bed, Old Lan-ye still couldn't sleep. He was planning the work for the next day. Finally, he worried, "The cadres have all left. Will the enthusiasm of the workers change?" He decided to get up early to take a look. As soon as it was dawn, he climbed to the top of a mountain behind the team headquarters and stood at the highest point to look around. At this time, groups of commune members were already carrying hoes and sickles, singing mountain songs, and coming out of various villages. He felt extremely happy, and a stone fell from his heart. This time, the team's cadres went to the commune for a meeting for eleven days. During these eleven days, in addition to working in the fields with the commune members during the day and planning and arranging work for everyone at night, Old Lan-ye also welcomed the inspection team sent by higher authorities, organized a competition meeting for feeders, arranged canteen work, and helped the masses deal with weddings and funerals. Not only did no problems arise, big or small, but all the work was done in an orderly manner, and everyone was satisfied.

    普通一社员
    记中孚公社人人尊敬的老社员——“我们的老兰爷”
    张辛　明智　生儒　郭楠
    “我们的老兰爷”这是一个包含着多么亲切和令人尊敬的称呼！牟友兰，一个六十八岁的老人，他毫无私心，坚持原则，敢说敢为，一心一意搞好集体的事业……。他是人民公社真正的主人，是值得大加赞扬和学习的榜样！
              要说要管
    甘肃省临洮县中孚人民公社红柳生产队，有一个六十八岁的老社员牟友兰，无论干部还是社员都尊敬而亲切地称他为“我们的老兰爷！”
    兰爷不是队干部，可是队里的大小事情，他都要过问，每个社员也都甘心情愿地服他指点。今年春耕的时候，有一天兰爷路过社员牟鸡鸣犁过的地里，发现地表面是翻起的一层虚土，下面却有很多板结土。兰爷当场就把牟鸡鸣批评了一顿，要他重犁。可是牟鸡鸣还在强词夺理地为自己辩护。为了教育牟鸡鸣，他就把同时犁地的几个社员叫到一块，当着大家的面，把地皮上的虚土刨开，板结的土都一块块的显露出来了。这一下牟鸡鸣没有话说了。兰爷指着板结的土说：“娃娃呀，你这是哄谁呢？人哄地皮，地哄肚皮，地犁不好，庄稼就长不好。社里收不下粮食，大家都没得吃，这不是自己哄了自己吗？”几句话把牟鸡鸣说得很羞愧，承认自己把事做错了，表示今后一定要把社里的事当作自己的事，认真负责地去干，并且把板结的地也重新犁过。
    兰爷不是饲养员，可是他每天都要到饲养场里转几次。他看见圈湿了就垫土，槽不干净就打扫，牲口身上脏了就洗刷，遇到孕畜临产的时候，还成夜守在跟前不离开。去年冬天，二小队的牲口喂得不好，受到批评的饲养员灰心丧气，哭着喊叫不干了。兰爷当天下午就把铺盖搬到饲养场，帮助饲养员喂牲口。饲养场里，一槽牲口中有口大的有口小的，吃草快慢也不一样，过去饲养员加料时，添到槽里就不管了，结果有些牲口抢不到料吃，瘦的就越瘦。兰爷改变了这种办法，使每头牲口都能吃到同样的料。他每天夜里都起来给牲口添三次草，每次添草时都把槽底打扫干净。经过一个多月的细心喂养，二小队的十四头牲口达到膘肥体壮，全部评上了一类。饲养员也眉开眼笑了，决定安下心来像老兰爷那样操心饲养牲口。
    兰爷不是放牧员，但他对社里的羊群也挺关心。去冬有个时期狼很多，他怕狼伤害了羊群，每天夜里不管刮风下雪，都要到羊圈周围转几圈。母羊陆续产冬羔了，有些断奶的小羊跟不上群，丢在圈里又没人经管，他就把自己家里的房子腾出一间，把羊羔抱来，白天喂草喂水，晚上生火给暖，四个多月功夫，把二十多只小羊都喂肥养大，跟上了大群放牧。
    兰爷不是食堂管理员，也不是炊事员，但从1958年建立食堂以后，他年年都给食堂种一、二亩蔬菜，自己耕，自己种，自己管；和其它社员一样，老兰爷也有几分自留地，他却没有像管理食堂的菜地那样下功夫。他一年四季手不离粪筐，每次拾下的粪，都上到这些菜地里去。去年他种的一亩白菜、辣子和茄子，就收获了两万斤，给食堂增加了大量新鲜蔬菜。
    老兰爷走到那里干到那里，看见什么就干什么，发现有什么做得不对的事，说得不对的话，就提意见。村上有个别人曾说：“老头子还能活几天，指手划脚地想干啥！”老兰爷说：“我又不是为了请功求赏呀！我是为大家。我那怕明天早上死，今天晚上还是要说要管！”
              全心全意
    今年初春的一天，老兰爷到中孚街上给牲口圈买门扣子。买好以后，天已经麻黑了，可是他还不急着回去，和往常一样顺便到公社党委办公室去坐坐。他是公社党委书记孙希荣的“农业参谋”，只要有时间，他总要把队里的生产情况向书记谈谈。碰巧，这时公社的干部正在开会，兰爷就问：“你们开的是啥会？是不是研究国家大事，能不能让我也听一听？”孙希荣满口答应，欢迎他参加。
    这次会议是研究抗旱生产问题。孙希荣传达了上级指示，指出今年根据气象预报可能发生严重旱象，要求大家积极响应省委的号召，提早作好防旱抗旱准备工作。老兰爷把党委书记的话，句句记在心中，今年可能发生大旱的事使他坐立不安了，觉得需要很快告诉队里，早作准备。会议一直开到夜里十点多钟，他不管天黑路远，急忙赶路回家。
    他一边走着，一边在捉摸。他想起了1929年大旱年景的一件事情：那年他经过实际研究，在四亩地里提前十天播种小麦，种到接近冻土，借土地解冻泛潮的水分，发芽生长了；以后虽然过了四十多天才下雨，但一逢雨水麦苗很快就缓过气来；6、7月是连月无雨，可这时他的小麦已经成熟了。老兰爷决定把这些老经验谈出来。
    兰爷走着想着，回到红柳村时已经深夜十二点了。他没顾上回家，一直跑到队部，把在公社听来的话和路上想的主意，从头到尾给党支部书记和队长说了一遍。最后他说：“去冬没落雪，眼下又没落雨，大旱怕是定了。小麦是耐旱的，今年应该多种，后天就交‘八九’，咱们应该早动手，早下种。”党支部书记李希禄完全赞成兰爷的主张，第二天就召集干部会和社员大会，介绍了兰爷的经验，决定把小麦种植面积扩大到二千一百亩，比头年增加90％；并且决定改变“九九”播麦的习惯，提前在“八九”的头一天开耧下种。
    下种的这天早晨，天麻麻亮兰爷就上地去了。他先到二小队和三小队，然后又转到一小队。山坡上、河川里到处响着嘀嘀哒哒的摇耧声，成群的社员赶着大骡子大马在种地，看到这些，兰爷高兴极了。他想：“只要大家拧成一股绳，就一定能战胜干旱夺得丰收。”可是，当他走到四小队时，连个人影子也看不见。“这是怎么搞的呢？”他找到小队长李天云，劈头就问：“各队早上都开种了，你们怎么还没种？”李天云先吞吞吐吐说耧还没收拾好，后来又说老人们意见种得早了不好。兰爷一听就有些生气，他说：“我看还是你思想不通。你还年青，经验少。党支部的决定没有错儿，要相信党！赶快把牲口?到地里种吧。”李天云答应马上就种以后，兰爷又到庄上的老汉李忠义家里去。他从李天云话里知道李忠义不同意早种，给出了一着瞎主意。他找到李忠义就比前比后说服解释，他说：“队上的事情，就是我们自个家的事情。我们老了，干不了重活，也出不了大力了。只要我们把年青人引到党指点的正道上，也算助了一臂之力。”经过这番努力，四小队当天下午也就开始种麦了。
    生产队集中全部人马突击抢种，很快就把原来整好的一千四百亩地种上了，接着就在谷茬地和洋芋茬地里播种。这部分地原来没计划种小麦，事先没打耱好，土块大，干土多。原来对早种有意见的人，这时又动摇了，认为这是白白浪费种籽，还是要求等下雨再种。兰爷就主动找党支部书记李希禄商量，提出把这些想不通的人带到地里，他给作样子让大家看。党支部立刻召集现场会，让兰爷进行现场表演。兰爷在大家面前，把一块洋芋茬地的土块打碎压碾以后，干土由七寸变成五寸，下面接着就是湿土；他又把耧脚的木铧和铁铧连在一起一量，刚好是五寸，这样刚好把籽儿种到湿土上，这一下把大家彻底说服了。就这样，红柳生产队今年提前十天完成了两千一百亩小麦的播种任务。从开耧播种那天算起，当地一连四十多天都没落雨，地更干了。但是随着解冻泛潮，麦苗全部出土，人常说：“见苗三分收”，社员们开始感激老兰爷了。到7月上旬，天又旱了。往年这时正是小麦扬花灌浆时节，急需雨水，但今年赶这时候全队的麦子却已成熟了，尽管今年天旱，红柳生产队却得到了丰收。
          爱社胜过爱家
    老兰爷把自己的全部精力贯注在公社的事情上，日日夜夜为大家操心操劳，往往是天不明就走出大门，直到半夜才回来，即使天阴下雨也很少待在家里。有人开玩笑地说：“兰爷，你的家究竟在那里呢？”他回答说：“公社就是我的家！走到那里，那里就是家。”事实上，兰爷爱社胜过爱家。
    盛夏的一个夜晚，兰爷正在睡梦中，忽然被轰隆隆的雷声惊醒了，瓢泼似的大雨下个不停。他急忙披衣下炕要出去堵洪水朝地里放。老伴儿慌忙拉住他说：“天这么黑，你跌跌撞撞地去干什么？”他听也不听，扛起一把铁铣就跑出去。这时天黑得伸手不见五指，他滑倒了再爬起来，浑身衣服都湿透了，可是他仍和社员们一起坚持引洪漫地，大家劝他回去，他说什么也不肯。地里灌满了洪水，他怕地埂缺口跑水，就黑摸着到各地里去转。一块地边果然开了豁口，大水哗哗地直朝外窜，他连忙铲土堵塞，但是不顶事，他就把棉背心脱下来压在水口上，还是不济事。他想：一块缺口就会造成块块缺口。于是毫不犹豫地跳下水去，卧到豁口上，用自己身体堵住洪水，直到社员闻声赶来，才把缺口填住了。这次，大部洪水都拦蓄在庄稼地里，灌了一次饱水。
    今年正当小麦快要黄熟和秋田锄草紧张的时候，队里的干部都要到公社去开会。临走那天，党支部书记李希禄把兰爷一找到队部，说：“我们走了以后，家里的事情就要请你多操心一些。”兰爷满口答应说：“你们只管放心，大小问题我都不让出！”
    兰爷把干部送走以后，就开始思谋眼下生产和生活上的许多问题。越想，他越感到担子不轻；越想，他越坐不住了。他忙起身走出队部，先到一小队的地里，看见几亩冬小麦已经黄熟了，就赶快把几个作业组长找到一块开了个会，组织社员突击抢收。这个小队的劳力少，锄草任务又大，他就到二小队动员，调来十几个人帮助收麦。这里安排好，他又到三小队，发现这里锄草任务很紧张，就到食堂和炊事员们研究，由于把饭送到地里，减少了社员往返吃饭的时间。等他跑完五个小队，太阳已经落山了，这时他还没吃午饭。晚饭后，他又把民兵找来开会，布置夜晚巡逻，看管已经快要黄熟的小麦。这天，从早晨到晚上他一直跑的没有停点，两条腿有点儿酸疼，真想躺下歇一歇。可是他又想起“年青人，瞌睡重，干了一天活，累了，会不会在地里睡着了呢？”想到这，他又拔起腿走了。到地头一看，到处游来游去的都是亮晶晶的马灯光，但他还不放心，又摸着黑到那些没有灯光的沟沟洼洼去检查，黑地里听见民兵在喊叫，这才心里一喜。等他到各个小队都检查完时，鸡已叫头遍了。
    躺到炕上，老兰爷还是睡不着，他在划算第二天的工作。最后又担心“干部都走了，大家劳动的劲头会不会有变化呢？”他决定要起个早看一看。天刚麻麻亮，他就爬上了队部后面的一座山头，站到最高处四面眺望。这时，一群群社员已经带着锄头镰刀，唱着山歌，正从各个村庄走出来。他感到万分高兴，心里的一块石头才落地。这次队里的干部到公社开了十一天会，在这十一天间，老兰爷除白天和社员们下地劳动、晚上为大家计划安排工作外，还迎接了上级派来的检查团，组织饲养员开了评比会，安排了食堂工作，并且帮助群众处理了婚丧大事。不仅大小问题没有出，各项工作都办得井井有条，人人满意。
