Eternal Memory
Cui Ronghe, Korean Student at Beijing Foreign Languages Institute

Every time I fasten my belt, the image of an unforgettable Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier appears before my eyes, and my emotions surge like a giant wave in my heart. This happened ten years ago...

In the winter of 1950, my hometown was liberated by the People's Army and the Volunteer Army, and the troops continued to advance south with irresistible force. The men, women, old, and young in the village warmly welcomed the saviors. I was overjoyed, running back and forth beside the road, waving my hands and shouting, "Long live! Long live!" At that time, I was only eleven years old and seeing Chinese people for the first time. In the past, in geography class, I had heard the teacher say that the hardworking and brave people of China and Korea lived in close harmony across the Yalu River. However, I had no idea what the Chinese people were actually like. The soldiers marched through the village in a mighty stream, singing "The Battle Song of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army." Before long, news spread on the street that a unit of the Volunteer Army would be staying in our village. The villagers immediately became active, warmly welcoming these saviors who had rescued them from the clutches of the enemy. Some were making rice cakes, some were slaughtering pigs, some were cooking noodles... every family was busy and filled with joy. According to our country's customs, this was only done during festivals or happy occasions. At that time, the village was short of grain and livestock. My family had nothing left, but I tugged at my mother's skirt, insisting that we make something delicious for the Volunteer Army uncles. My mother happily borrowed three liters of glutinous rice from a neighbor. She busied herself grinding the rice, while I fetched water and started the fire... preparing to make rice cakes. That day, the wind and snow were particularly heavy, and the weather was very cold. In the evening, a female Volunteer Army soldier, supporting a wounded soldier, came to my house. She was a medic and spoke fluent Korean. She told my mother that the wounded soldier needed to stay in our house for treatment. My mother readily agreed and quickly settled him in the warmest spot on the heated kang, covering him with a thick quilt. The wounded soldier lay weakly, falling asleep soon after. There was no lamp in the room, so I never clearly saw his face. The female soldier told us her surname was Liu and called the wounded soldier "Comrade Wang," saying he had been wounded in this battle. My mother talked a lot with Sister Liu, and I sat next to Sister Liu, listening clearly to everything. "After the American devils occupied our hometown, they killed labor party members, seized grain, and burned down houses. The poor children cried and ran out of the houses, and the robbers used their shiny bayonets to stab the children and throw them into the sea. What a group of inhuman beasts!" My mother said, looking at me, and then continued, "My child was also locked in a warehouse by them. When the enemy fled, they poured gasoline on the warehouse and immediately set it on fire. At that critical moment, the Volunteer Army soldiers came to rescue him..." My mother couldn't continue speaking, overcome with emotion. Hearing this, I immediately remembered the dangerous moment when I was locked in the warehouse yesterday and suddenly felt sweaty and scared! My mother tightly grasped Sister Liu's hand and said, "You are such good people!" I couldn't help but look up at Sister Liu's face. She didn't say a word, but just smiled, looking at us with a very peaceful gaze.

The next morning, my mother and Sister Liu talked until the rooster crowed, but they got up early, and the soldier also woke up early. He looked at me, and I looked at him. Why did he look so familiar? Dear readers, can you understand my feelings at that time? "Brother Wang! Brother Wang!..." I suddenly shouted loudly, and he also grinned, quickly embracing me, saying, "We've met again!" The room was instantly filled with joy. My mother and Sister Liu didn't know what was going on. I hurriedly and happily told them that he was the savior who had rescued me yesterday. My mother was so excited that she couldn't speak for a moment. The sun had already shown half of its red face. As we were talking, a Volunteer Army officer suddenly pushed the door open, consulted with Sister Liu for a while, and then told us that they were both leaving with the troops. I simply didn't want to leave them, holding their hands tightly.

As they packed their luggage, I grabbed Brother Wang's belt with one hand and said, "I want to go with you too!" He coaxed me, saying, "You're only eleven years old, you can't carry a gun yet. I'll let you go when you grow up!" I simply refused to listen to Brother Wang's words. Sister Liu stroked my head and took out a handkerchief to wipe my nose. Then, Brother Wang took off the belt he was wearing around his waist and said:
"There's nothing to give you as a souvenir, so I'll leave this belt with you! In the future, when you are living a happy life in peaceful times, when you see it, you will remember today's war life." Saying this, he immediately pulled me to his side and fastened the belt around my waist. Finally, Brother Wang and Sister Liu bowed deeply to my mother according to Korean customs.

At this moment, the departure bugle sounded from afar. Sister Liu then helped Brother Wang leave us. The team gradually disappeared into the rugged mountain road. My mother and I stood at the village entrance, still waving our hands to see off the team. I saw my mother wiping her tears with her clothes from time to time. When I persuaded my mother to go home, I realized that I had been holding that belt tightly all along. ............

Ten years have passed since the incident with this belt. Today, I still keep it by my side, and I will always keep it in the future. This belt will tell me how the friendship between the people of China and Korea was forged with blood, and it will remain in my memory.

    永恒的记忆
    北京外国语学院朝鲜留学生　崔荣河
    每当我系皮带的时候，一位不可忘记的中国人民志愿军战士的形象便浮在我的眼前，我的感情便像巨浪似地在心海里翻腾，这是十年前的事情了……
    1950年冬季，我的家乡被人民军和志愿军解放了，部队势如破竹地向南继续前进。村里的男女老少都热烈地欢迎着救命的恩人。我高兴得不得了，在马路旁边跑来跑去挥着手喊：“万岁！万岁！” 当时，我只有十一岁，还是初次看见中国人。过去，在上地理课时，听老师讲过：勤劳勇敢的朝中两国人民相隔一条鸭绿江，亲密和睦地生活着。但是，中国人究竟是什么样子，我却一无所知。战士们高唱着《中国人民志愿军战歌》浩浩荡荡地走过村庄。不一会，在街上就流传着这样一个消息：志愿军的一支部队要留在我们的村里了。乡亲们顿时活跃起来，他们盛情招待着这些把自己从敌人的魔爪中拯救出来的救命恩人。有的打年糕，有的杀猪，有的煮面条……真是家家忙忙碌碌，喜气洋洋。按着我国人民的风俗，每逢佳节或喜日的时候，才是这样呢。当时，村里的粮食、牲口都很缺。我家里什么都没有了，但是，我揪着妈妈的裙子闹着一定要给志愿军叔叔做好吃的。妈妈高兴地从邻居那里借来了三升粘米。她忙着去推磨，我就去挑水，生火……准备着打年糕。这天，风雪格外紧，气候十分寒冷，傍晚的时候，一位志愿军女战士扶着一位伤员来到了我的家里。她是个卫生员，朝鲜话讲得很流利。她告诉妈妈，那位伤员需要留住在我的家里治病。妈妈满口同意，连忙把他安置在炕上最暖和的地方，还给他盖上了厚厚的被子。那个伤员有气没力地躺着，不多一会就睡熟了。屋里没有灯，我始终没看清他的模样。女战士告诉我们说她姓刘，称那个伤员为“王同志”，他是在这次战斗中负伤的。妈妈跟刘姐姐谈了很多话，我坐在刘姐姐的旁边都听清楚了。“美国鬼子占了我们的家乡以后，杀害劳动党员，抢走粮食，烧毁了房屋。可怜的孩子们哭叫着从屋子里跑出来，强盗们就用明晃晃的刺刀挑起孩子们投入海里。这是一群多么惨无人道的野兽呀！”妈妈说着望了望我，然后接着说：“我的孩子也被他们关在一个仓库里。敌人逃跑的时候，把仓库倒上了汽油，立刻烧起了大火，就在这千钧一发的紧要关头，志愿军战士来救了他……”妈妈说到这里，感动得说不下去了。我听到这里，马上就想起昨天我被关在仓库里的危险时刻，忽然觉得身上流汗水，害怕得很！妈妈紧握住刘姐姐的手说：“你们是多么好的人啊！”我不由得抬起头来望着刘姐姐的脸。她不说一句话，只是微笑着用非常安详的眼光望着我们。
    第二天早晨，妈妈和刘姐姐一直谈到了鸡叫，可是她们起得很早，那个战士也很早醒来了。他看了看我，我看了看他，他怎么这样面熟呢？亲爱的读者们，你们能了解我当时的心情吗？“王哥哥！王哥哥！……”我突然高声地叫起来，他也眉开眼笑地赶紧把我搂在怀里，说：“我们重新见面了！”屋里顿时充满了欢乐。妈妈和刘姐姐不知道这是怎么回事。我急忙高兴地告诉了她们，他就是昨天救我的恩人。妈妈激动得一时说不出话来。太阳已经露出半个红脸来，我们谈着谈着，忽然有位志愿军军官推门进来，他跟刘姐姐商量了一会，然后告诉我们，他们两人就要跟着部队离开这里了。我简直不愿意离开他们，拉住他们的手一直不放。
    他们俩收拾行李了，我一手拉住王哥哥的皮带说：“我也要跟你一块去！”他哄着我说：“你才十一岁，还背不动枪呢，等长大了让你去吧！”我根本不肯听王哥哥的话，刘姐姐抚摸着我的头，掏出手巾来给我擦了擦鼻子。接着王哥哥就把系在腰上的皮带解下来说：
  “没有什么可给你做纪念的，就把这条皮带留给你吧！将来，当你在和平的日子里，重过幸福生活的时候，看到了它，你便会想起今天的战争生活来。”说到这里，他立刻把我拉到他身旁，把皮带系在我的腰上。最后，王哥哥和刘姐姐按照朝鲜人民的礼节，给妈妈深深地鞠了一躬。
    这时候，从远处响起了出发的号声。刘姐姐就搀扶着王哥哥离开了我们。队伍逐渐消失在崎岖的山路中，妈妈和我站在村头，仍然挥动着手送别队伍。我看到妈妈不时用衣带擦拭眼泪，等我劝妈妈回家时，我才发现自己一直紧紧地握着那条皮带。……………
    这条皮带的事已经隔了十年了，今天我还把它保存在我的身边，而且我以后也要永远保存着它。这皮带将告诉我朝中两国人民的友谊是怎样用鲜血凝成的，它将保留在我的记忆里。
