Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 29th—To welcome the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the "Albania-China Friendship" agricultural production cooperative in the suburbs of Tirana held a celebration on the afternoon of the 27th.

Attending the celebration were Koçi, First Secretary of the Tirana District Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Tashko, President of the Agricultural College, and others.

Luo Shigao, the Chinese Ambassador to Albania, and embassy staff were invited to attend the celebration.

Tashko, the President of the Agricultural College, who had visited China, gave a report to the cooperative members on the role of Chinese farmers in socialist construction. He introduced in detail and vividly what he saw and heard in China, especially the achievements of Chinese farmers in increasing grain production, building water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, and developing animal husbandry.

Koçi, First Secretary of the Tirana District Committee, spoke at the meeting, saying that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, Chinese farmers have made great achievements on the road of socialist construction, and their achievements are our achievements. He said that this year, the "Albania-China Friendship" agricultural production cooperative's grain production increased by more than one hundred quintals compared to last year, vegetable production doubled, and milk production increased fivefold. But we should not be satisfied with this, we should better learn from the experience of Chinese farmers and do our work well to respond to the glorious title of "Albania-China Friendship" agricultural production cooperative.

A meal was held after the meeting. Ambassador Luo Shigao had a cordial conversation with the cooperative members.

The Tirana Radio Station has recently added a special program called "News from Beijing," introducing China's achievements in socialist construction, the life of the people's communes, and the Tibetan farmers of New China.
