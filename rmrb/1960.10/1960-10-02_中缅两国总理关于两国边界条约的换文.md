    Exchange of Notes between the Prime Ministers of China and Burma Regarding the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty

    Note from Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, to Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, U Nu

    To His Excellency U Nu, Prime Minister of the Union of Burma:

    In the process of negotiating the Boundary Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma, both sides reached understandings on the following issues. I now, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, confirm as follows:

    1.  Residents of areas transferred by one party to the other in accordance with Articles 1, 2, and 3 of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty should be recognized as citizens of the party to which the area belongs after the area is transferred to the other party; if any residents of the area do not wish to move with the area to the other party, they may declare their choice of the original party's nationality within one year after the treaty comes into effect and may move to reside within the original party's territory within two years. When the aforementioned residents move, their movable property may be taken out of the country, and immovable property may be transferred at a discounted price.

    2.  Based on the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in order to facilitate their respective administrative management and avoid disputes between the border residents of both sides, so as to promote the friendly and harmonious relations between the border residents of the two countries, both sides agree that the existing issues of cross-border cultivation in the Sino-Burmese border area and those arising from this demarcation and adjustment of straddling villages should be resolved. To this end, the following principles are established:

    	(1) Both parties guarantee that their border residents will not develop new cross-border cultivation relationships in the territory of the other party in the future, and shall not restore abandoned or managed cross-border cultivated land.

    	(2) The two governments should take measures to gradually eliminate the phenomenon of cross-border cultivation by border residents within three years after the treaty comes into effect.

    	(3) When border residents of both sides continue to cultivate land across the border within the above-mentioned period, they shall abide by the laws and regulations of the country where the cultivated land is located.

    	(4) In order to implement the above agreement, local officials of both sides may hold meetings as needed to negotiate and resolve relevant issues. The procedures for the meetings shall be agreed upon by the two governments.

    3.  In order to promote friendly relations between the two sides in the border areas, local officials of the two countries will hold meetings as needed to resolve local issues occurring on the border between the two sides.

    After the above points are confirmed by Your Excellency, this note and your reply shall become an agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Union of Burma and shall take effect simultaneously with the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty.

    Please accept the assurances of my highest consideration.

    给缅甸联邦总理吴努的照会缅甸联邦总理吴努阁下：
    在中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦边界条约的谈判过程中，我们双方曾就下列各项问题达成了谅解，现在我谨代表中华人民共和国政府确认如下：
    一、根据中缅边界条约第一条、第二条和第三条的规定由一方移交给另一方的地区的居民，在各该地区移交给另一方以后，应该被确认为该地区所属一方的公民；如果该地区的居民中有人不愿意随地区转移到另一方，可以在条约生效后一年内声明选择原来一方的国籍，并可在两年以内迁入原来一方的境内居住。上述居民迁移时，其动产可以携带出境，不动产可以折价出让。
    二、双方根据互相尊重主权和领土完整的原则，并且为了便于各自的行政管理和避免双方边民间的纠纷，以利于促进两国边民友好和睦关系的发展，一致认为中缅边境地区现存的和因这次划界及调整骑线村寨而产生的过界耕地问题，应该予以解决。为此，确定原则如下：
    （1）双方保证本国边民今后不再在对方境内发展新的过界耕种关系，并不得恢复已经放弃耕种或经营的过耕土地。
    （2）对于边民过界耕地现象，双方政府应采取措施在条约生效后三年内逐步加以消除。
    （3）双方边民在以上规定的期间内继续过界耕地时，应遵守耕地所在国的法令。
    （4）为了执行上述协议，双方地方官员可以根据情况需要举行会晤，协商解决有关问题。会晤的程序由两国政府商定。
    三、为了促进双方在边境地区的友好关系，两国的地方官员将根据需要举行会晤，以解决双方边境上发生的地方性的问题。
    上述各点在获得阁下的确认后，本照会和您的复照即成为中华人民共和国政府和缅甸联邦政府之间的协议，同中缅边界条约同时生效。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
