Listen to What People Say and Watch What They Do
By People's Daily Commentator

On the evening of October 17, the United Nations General Assembly passed the "Cooperation of Member States" proposal submitted by India and 27 other countries with a vote of 91 to 0, with 8 abstentions. This proposal requests all countries to "refrain from actions that may aggravate international tensions, in accordance with the United Nations Charter"; calls on United Nations member states to cooperate so that the United Nations becomes "a more effective instrument for safeguarding peace and promoting the economic and social progress of all mankind"; and requests member states to "take constructive steps immediately on pressing issues concerning world peace and human progress."

Undoubtedly, this proposal by the 28 countries expresses the concern of the majority of non-aligned countries for world peace and is a new effort to strive for the easing of international tensions. It also reflects the universal desire for peace of people all over the world. Although this proposal does not mention the specific content of safeguarding world peace, especially the fact that the US authorities are stepping up arms expansion and war preparations and intensifying international tensions, it is still a good thing that the General Assembly passed this resolution conducive to easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace.

The proceedings of this session of the United Nations General Assembly most clearly show who is willing to ease international tensions and has taken various constructive steps, and who is adhering to the Cold War policy and refusing to take any action conducive to easing international tensions.

The socialist countries, headed by the Soviet Union, put forward a series of proposals at this conference in order to enable the United Nations to fulfill its responsibility of easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace. However, these proposals have been firmly opposed by the imperialist countries, headed by the United States.

For example, on the issue of restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, under the manipulation of the United States, the General Assembly once again passed the US proposal to refuse to discuss the restoration of China's legitimate seat. Is this a manifestation of US imperialism making the United Nations a "more effective instrument"?

For another example, the United Nations General Assembly also refused to discuss the issue of US aircraft invading Soviet airspace, openly condoning this US military provocation that threatens world peace. Is this conducive to safeguarding peace?

It can be seen that the root of international tension lies in US imperialism, and the threat to world peace comes from US imperialism. To ease international tensions and safeguard world peace, we must first firmly oppose the US policy of aggression and war. Whether the United Nations can become an effective tool for safeguarding peace depends first and foremost on the attitude of the United States and other Western countries. The Political Committee of the General Assembly began debating the disarmament issue on the 19th. What constructive steps the Western countries will take to change their stubborn attitude of obstructing and undermining disarmament negotiations will be a touchstone for the true intentions of the United States in voting in favor of the 28-nation proposal.

People remember that at the last session of the United Nations General Assembly, a joint proposal on general and complete disarmament put forward by the Soviet Union and the United States was also unanimously adopted. At the time of the adoption of this proposal, people once hoped that this was the first step in breaking the long-standing deadlock in disarmament negotiations. US representative Lodge even hypocritically stated that the United States would "do its utmost to achieve good results" in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee. However, a year has passed, and the beautiful resolution is still black and white on paper, and no progress has been made in disarmament negotiations. And the United States, which publicly announced that it would do its utmost to achieve good results, has become the culprit for undermining the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee.

The current tensions in many parts of the world are caused by the United States. While stepping up its interference in Cuba and Laos, it continues to run amok in the Congo under the guise of the United Nations. Since the United States voted in favor of the proposal to take constructive steps to ease international tensions, shouldn't it first immediately stop these "actions that aggravate international tensions"?

"Listen to what people say and watch what they do" is a maxim for examining people's words and deeds, and such an attitude should also be adopted towards the US endorsement of the 28-nation proposal.

    听其言　观其行
    本报评论员
    联合国大会17日晚以九十一票对零票，八票缺席，通过了印度等二十八国提出的“会员国的合作”的提案。这一提案，要求所有国家，“根据联合国宪章，不采取可能加剧国际紧张局势的行动”；呼吁联合国会员国合作，以便使联合国成为“保障和平和促进全人类经济和社会进步的更加有效的工具”；要求会员国“就有关世界和平和人类进步的迫切问题立即采取建设性的步骤”。
    无疑的，二十八国的这一提案，表示了多数奉行不结盟政策的国家对于世界和平的关心，并为争取和缓国际紧张局势所作的一次新的努力。这也反映了全世界各国人民的普遍的和平愿望。尽管这一提案没有提到保障世界和平的具体内容，尤其是没有指出美国当局加紧扩军备战、加剧国际紧张局势，但是大会通过这一有利于和缓国际紧张局势和保障世界和平的决议，仍然是一件好事。
    这一届联合国大会的进程，最清楚不过地表明了谁愿意和缓国际紧张局势，并且采取了种种建设性的步骤，而又是谁在坚持冷战政策，拒绝采取任何有利于缓和国际紧张局势的行动。
    以苏联为首的社会主义国家，为促使联合国组织能够负起和缓国际紧张局势、保障世界和平的职责，在这次大会上提出了一系列的建议。但是，这些建议都遭到以美国为首的帝国主义国家的坚决反对。
    例如，关于恢复中国在联合国的合法权利的问题，在美国操纵下，大会又一次通过了美国拒不讨论恢复中国合法席位问题的提案。难道这是美帝国主义具有使联合国成为什么“更加有效工具”的表现吗？
    又如联合国大会还拒绝讨论美国飞机侵犯苏联领空问题，公然庇护美国这一威胁世界和平的军事挑衅行为。难道这是有利于保障和平的吗？
    可见，国际紧张局势的根源在于美帝国主义，世界和平的威胁来自美帝国主义。要和缓国际紧张局势，要保障世界和平，首先必须坚决反对美国的侵略政策和战争政策。联合国能否成为保障和平的有效工具，这首先要看美国和其他西方国家的态度。联大政治委员会从19日开始辩论裁军问题。西方国家究竟将采取什么样的有建设性的步骤来改变自己阻挠和破坏裁军谈判的顽固态度，将成为美国投票赞成二十八国提案的真实意向的试金石。
    人们记得，在上一届联合国大会上，也曾经一致通过了苏联和美国提出的关于全面和彻底裁军问题的联合提案，在通过这一提案的当时，人们曾经希望这是打开裁军谈判多年僵局的第一步。而美国代表洛奇还假惺惺地表示，美国将在十国裁军委员会中，“尽全力争取获得良好的结果”。可是，时过一年，漂亮的决议仍是白纸上的黑字，裁军谈判没有获得一点进展。而当众宣布将尽全力争取良好结果的美国，却成为破坏十国裁军谈判的祸首。
    目前在全世界许多地方的紧张局势是由美国一手造成的。它在加紧干涉古巴和老挝的同时，继续利用联合国的幌子，在刚果横行霸道。美国既然投票赞成采取建设性步骤缓和国际紧张局势的提案，那么，难道它首先不是应该立即停止这些“加剧国际紧张局势的行动”吗？
    “听其言而观其行”，这是检验人们的言行的格言，对于美国赞成二十八国提案，也应当采取这样的态度。
