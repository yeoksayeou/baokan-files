    Knowledge and Ignorance
    By Xing Huo
    On October 26th, the People's Daily published a report about Qiao Jiguang becoming a farmer. The report described the experience of Qiao Jiguang, an intellectual, becoming a farmer, and his feelings during labor. There is the following passage:
    “Carrying manure is hard work. Not only do you have to carry the manure out of the toilet, but you also have to send it to the cart. Qiao Jiguang had never done this before, and as soon as he started, he knocked the bottom out of the manure bucket, splashing himself with manure. Old man Li Shengyi smiled and said, ‘Young man, even emptying the latrine requires learning!’ Although Qiao Jiguang felt a burning sensation in his heart, he didn't say anything. He thought to himself: The bottom of the manure bucket is easily knocked off on the cart, mainly because the friction is too great. Wouldn't it be better to sprinkle some water on the cart to make the board slippery? He tried it, and it worked. The loading speed also increased. Old man Li Shengyi was so happy that he kept praising him, saying, 'Books have not been read in vain!'" Later, because Qiao Jiguang improved the belt device of the electric waterwheel, the work that originally required three people could be done by two.
    This description is simple in language, touching in plot, and profound in meaning.
    The “knowledge” of intellectuals is actually two-sided. One side is called knowledge, and the other side is called ignorance. For the sake of convenience, let's start with ignorance.
    The so-called "ignorance" means that intellectuals lack specific feelings and experiences of class struggle and production struggle, and do not understand things. When they first participate in production and come into contact with reality, jokes like knocking the bottom out of the manure bucket will often happen, and can even be said to be inevitable. However, this is neither strange nor terrible. If you don't understand, ask; if you can't do it, learn; delve into it, one month, two months, one year, two years, ignorance will turn into knowledge, and incompetence will turn into competence. With the courage to practice, most of the problem is solved. The skill of hitting the bullseye from a hundred paces is nothing more than practice makes perfect.
    The so-called "knowledge" means that they have certain cultural and scientific knowledge. It is inappropriate to overestimate this knowledge, and it is unfair to ignore it. However, when this knowledge is still staying in the classroom and in the study, it is temporarily a dead thing. Once it is applied in practice, it comes alive. It is possible to create and develop through practice.
    Comrades, haven't we seen two different varieties of fruit trees grafted together? The fruit that grows after grafting is often particularly red, particularly large, and particularly delicious. Similarly, when book knowledge is grafted with practice, mental labor with physical labor, and mental laborers with physical laborers, or in other words, combined together, it will produce extraordinary effects and functions, and will bloom healthy and beautiful flowers!
    Reducing resistance for manure trucks and improving the waterwheel belt device are naturally small things. However, in these ordinary deeds, we see an extraordinary trend, that is: thousands upon thousands of intellectuals in our country will take root and settle down in the countryside. If they are willing to learn humbly and are good at thinking about problems, then won't we have thousands upon thousands of improvements, innovations, creations, and inventions on our entire agricultural front?
    A great situation in which flowers bloom everywhere and exotic fruits fill the garden on the agricultural front, the grain front, and the ideological front is right in front of us. Let us open our enthusiastic arms and rush forward to greet it!

    有知与无知
    星火
    10月26日人民日报上发表了一篇乔继光当农民的通讯：通讯中叙述了知识分子出身的乔继光当农民的经过及其在劳动中的感受。其中有这末一段：
    “担粪是个重活儿，不但要把粪从厕所担出来，还得送到大车上。乔继光没干过，一上手，就把粪桶底子给碰掉了，洒了一身大粪。李生义老汉笑着说：‘年轻人，掏粪也得学哩！’乔继光心里虽然觉得热辣辣的，也没说什么。心想：粪桶子上了车碰底子，主要是磨擦力太大，要是给车上洒点水，车板滑了，不就好些吗？他试了试，果然有效，装车速度也加快了。乐得李生义老汉不住地称赞说：‘书是没有白念了’！”后来，又由于乔继光改进了电动水车的皮带装置，原来三个人干的活，两个人就行了。
    这段叙述，语言是朴素的，情节是动人的，意味是深长的。
    知识分子的“知”，其实是两面的。一面叫有知，一面叫无知。为行文的方便起见，先从无知谈起。
    所说“无知”，是知识分子缺乏阶级斗争、生产斗争的具体感受、具体经验、不懂事。当他们刚刚参加生产、接触实际的时候，把粪桶底给碰掉那样的笑话，常常会有，甚至可以说一定会有。但是，这既不奇怪，也不可怕。不懂就问，不会就学，钻进去，一月两月、一年两年，无知会变成有知，无能会变成有能。有了勇于实践这一条，就问题解决了一大半。百步穿杨的本领，也无非是手熟而已。
    所说“有知”，就是说他们有一定的文化科学知识。高估这些知识固然是不适当的，无视这些知识也是不公平的。但是，当这些知识还停留在课堂、停留在书斋的时候，它暂时还是死东西，一经它在实践中加以运用，那就活了。就可能通过实践有所创造、有所发展。
    同志，我们不是看到过两种品种不同的果树接嫁吗？接嫁后生出来的果实，往往特别红、特别大、特别鲜美可口。同样地，书本知识与实践、脑力劳动与体力劳动、脑力劳动者与体力劳动者接嫁在一起，或者说结合在一起，就会产生出乎常规的奇效与功能，就会开放出健康而又鲜艳的花朵来！
    装粪车减阻力，改进水车皮带装置这两件事，自然是小焉者的。然而，在这平凡的事迹里，却看到了一个不平凡的趋向，那就是：我国将有成千成万的知识分子要在农村里生根、落户，如果他们是肯于虚心学的，又是善于思考问题的，那么，我们整个农业战线上不是就有成千成万个改进、革新、创造、发明吗？
    一个农业战线上、粮食战线上、思想战线上遍地花开，满园异果的大好局面就在眼前，让我们伸开热情的两臂，奔向前去迎接吧！
