Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China received a telegram from the Central Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party congratulating China on its National Day. The text is as follows: To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, dear comrades:

    On this glorious and historic day, you joyfully celebrate the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the heroic People's Democratic Republic. This is not only a sublime expression of joy for the great Chinese people and their glorious working class, but also a great joy for us and all progressive humanity. Because in your victorious struggle, you have defeated the despicable imperialist forces and their handful of reactionary agents. The fighting Chinese people have been liberated from the shackles of enslavement and exploitation, winning praise and respect from countries all over the world, while frightening the imperialists and reactionary traitorous running dogs.

    The struggle of your long-tested Party, and the experienced leadership headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, are decisive factors in mobilizing the strength of the people, inspiring their enthusiasm, and marching towards the road to victory. Your rich experience in struggle has enriched the practical experience of the world's struggle and has a direct impact on promoting the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for political and economic liberation and a prosperous life.

    The unity of the world's working class, loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and the unity of the powerful socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union are the main cornerstones of the world's struggle against imperialism and war. The rapid economic, scientific, cultural, and social development of socialist countries, and their surpassing of the decaying imperialist camp in science and technology, have changed the balance of world power in favor of the world proletariat and the people of all countries, increasing their chances of striving for liberation, peace, and socialism.

    The Iraqi people will not forget the strong support and sincere help you have given since the patriotic revolution of July 14, 1958. At the same time, they respect your sincere support for the struggles of Algeria, Oman, and other parts of the Arab world and the Arab people, where they are still suffering from massive imperialist exploitation, feudal darkness, and socio-economic backwardness. The Iraqi people support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and view the great socialist achievements of the Chinese people with admiration and praise.

    The Arab people regard every victory and every progress you have made as their own victory and progress in the struggle against imperialism, against war, and for liberation and progress.

    We, the Iraqi Communist Party, study and often study the rich experience of the great Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party is an outstanding example of loyalty to and practical application of Marxism-Leninism. Our Party has profound respect for the role played by the fraternal Chinese Party in strengthening the unity of the world's workers' movement and in strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and its glorious Communist Party.

    Dear comrades, we extend to you our heartfelt love and respect; we congratulate you on this glorious anniversary; we share your joy; and wish the Party, the working class, and the great Chinese people greater achievements under your wise leadership.

    Please accept our communist greetings.
          Central Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party

    伊拉克共产党中央电贺我国庆
    新华社7日讯　中共中央收到了伊拉克共产党中央委员会发来的祝贺我国国庆的电报。电文如下：中国共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    在光辉的历史性的今天，你们愉快地庆祝英雄的人民民主共和国建立十一周年。这不仅是伟大的中国人民及其光荣的工人阶级欢乐的崇高表现，同样也是我们和所有进步人类的巨大欢欣。因为在你们胜利的斗争中，已经战胜了卑劣的帝国主义力量及其一小撮反动代理人，战斗的中国人民已从奴役和剥削的枷锁中获得解放，世界各国为之赞扬和尊敬，而使帝国主义者和反动的叛国走狗丧胆心惊。
    你们久经考验的党的斗争，和以毛泽东同志为首的有经验的领导，是动员人民力量、鼓舞人民热情，并走向胜利道路的决定性因素。你们的丰富的斗争经验，丰富了世界斗争的实践经验，对促进亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民为争取政治和经济上的解放、繁荣生活的斗争有直接的影响。
    世界工人阶级的团结，对马克思列宁主义原则的忠诚，以及以伟大苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的团结，是反对帝国主义和战争的世界斗争的主要基石。社会主义各国在经济、科学、文化、社会方面的迅速发展，并在科学技术方面超过腐朽的帝国主义阵营，改变了世界力量的对比有利于世界无产阶级和各国人民，增加了他们争取解放、和平、社会主义的可能性。
    伊拉克人民不会忘记：你们自从1958年7月14日爱国革命后所给予的有力支持和真诚的帮助。同时也尊重你们对阿尔及利亚、阿曼和其他阿拉伯世界、阿拉伯人民斗争的真诚的支持，那些地方仍然遭受着帝国主义的大量剥削、封建黑暗和社会经济的落后。伊拉克人民支持中国人民解放台湾的斗争，并以钦佩和赞扬的目光看待中国人民的社会主义巨大成就。
    阿拉伯人民把你们取得的每一个胜利、每一个进步，视为他们自己在反对帝国主义、反对战争以及争取解放和进步斗争中的胜利和进步。
    我们伊拉克共产党学习并且经常学习伟大的中国共产党的丰富经验。中国共产党是忠诚于、并且是实际运用马克思列宁主义的杰出榜样。我党对于兄弟般的中国党在加强世界工人运动的团结，以及在加强以苏联及其光荣的共产党为首的社会主义阵营团结中所起的作用，抱有深刻的敬意。
    亲爱的同志们，我们以心底深处的热爱和敬意向你们致意；我们祝贺你们这个光荣的纪念日；我们与你们共度欢乐；祝党、工人阶级和伟大的中国人民在你们英明的领导下取得更大的成就。
    请接受我们共产主义的敬意。
          伊拉克共产党中央委员会　1960年10月1日
