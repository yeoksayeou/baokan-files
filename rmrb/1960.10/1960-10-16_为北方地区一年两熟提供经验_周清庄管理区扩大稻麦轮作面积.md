Xinhua News Agency report: Zhou Qingzhuang Management District of Nandagang Commune in Huanghua County, Hebei, has summarized its experience in increasing production through rice-wheat rotation over the past two years. It has expanded the area of rice-wheat rotation, and the plan to expand the wheat planting area in the entire management district has been fully implemented in the fields.

Rice-wheat rotation allows for two harvests a year, which is an important measure for rice-growing areas to increase land utilization and for low-lying areas to substantially increase grain production. Last year, Zhou Qingzhuang Management District planted autumn wheat and spring wheat on 3,950 mu of rice stubble, and all of them harvested more grain than single-season early rice and wheat. This year, based on the spirit of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, the management district's Party general branch decided to implement rice-wheat rotation on all 12,000 mu of rice fields. The benefits of rice-wheat rotation are: both rice and wheat are soft-stalk crops, and they prefer to absorb organic fertilizers during their growth period. After dry land is converted into paddy fields, the roots of rice, wheat, and weeds, through irrigation and soaking, form natural organic fertilizers, which can ensure that crops have better nutrients; the late-stage management of rice mainly involves water and fertilizer, and the irrigation period prepares the land for silt deposition for wheat fields. Generally, a layer of silt about two inches deep on the surface can play a role in suppressing alkali, loosening the soil, increasing humus, and fertilizing the soil.

When summarizing the experience of increasing production through rice-wheat rotation, people unanimously agreed that early planting, strengthening crop management, and promoting early maturity of crops are the guarantees for increasing rice and wheat production. Local rice requires a growing period of 120 days, while autumn wheat has a growing period of up to 250 days. The total crop occupancy time throughout the year is about 370 days. In order to solve the contradiction between farming time and rotation, it was decided to cultivate seedlings well before the wheat matures, and when the wheat is harvested, concentrate labor to harvest one piece and plant one piece, so as to achieve "early seedlings and late transplanting"; stop irrigation ten days before the rice matures, and drain the water. When sowing wheat, implement furrow sowing (without plowing and sunning the soil) to save time, and select early-maturing and high-yielding fine varieties for appropriate dense planting. During the rice and wheat growth period, effectively strengthen the management work centered on water and fertilizer, and closely combine the work of intertillage, weeding, insect removal, and disease prevention to promote early maturity and early harvest. Taking these measures can overcome the contradiction between rotation and farming time, and ensure that the sowing of late rice and autumn wheat does not delay the farming season.

Currently, cadres and the masses in Zhou Qingzhuang Management District are actively taking action. The management district has established a rice-wheat rotation technical guidance organization headed by Song Wenquan, the general branch secretary, and each production team has also absorbed experienced farmers to establish technical groups, starting to train technical forces and comprehensively arranging labor.

    为北方地区一年两熟提供经验
    周清庄管理区扩大稻麦轮作面积
    据新华社讯  河北黄骅县南大港公社周清庄管理区，总结两年来稻麦轮作增产经验，增加稻麦轮作面积，全管理区扩大种麦面积的计划已经全部落实到田。
    稻麦轮作可以一年两收，是稻田区提高土地利用率、低洼地区大幅度增产粮食的重要措施。周清庄管理区去年有三千九百五十亩稻茬接种秋麦和春麦，都比单季早稻和小麦多收了粮食。今年管理区党总支本着大办农业、大办粮食的精神，决定把一万二千亩稻田全部实行稻麦轮作。稻麦轮作的好处是：稻子和麦子都是软秆作物，生长期喜吸收有机质肥料，旱田变水田后，稻根、麦根和杂草根叶，经灌水沤制，形成自然的有机质肥料，可以保证作物有较好的养分；稻子的后期管理，主要是水肥，灌水期间就为麦田作好了放淤准备，一般地表淤泥二寸深左右，能起压碱、疏松土性、增多腐熟质，肥沃土壤的作用。
    人们在总结稻麦轮作增产经验时，一致认为早种、加强作物管理、促使作物早熟，是稻麦增产的保证。当地稻子需要一百二十天的生长期，秋麦的生长期则长达二百五十天。全年作物占地需时三百七十天左右。为了解决农时与轮作的矛盾，决定在麦子成熟前育好秧苗，麦子收割时，集中劳力采取熟一块、收一块，整一块、插一块，作到“早秧晚插”；稻子成熟前十天停止灌水，放水落干。麦播时实行犁沟种麦（不用耕翻晒垡），以争取时间，并选用早熟高产的优良品种实行适当密植。在稻麦生长期，切实加强以水肥为中心的管理工作，中耕、除草、除虫和防病等工作紧密结合进行，促使早熟早收。采取这些措施，可以克服轮作与农时的矛盾，保证晚稻和秋麦播种不误农时。
    目前，周清庄管理区的干部和群众正积极行动起来，管理区成立了以总支书记宋文全为首的稻麦轮作技术指导组织，各生产队也吸收老农参加建立技术小组，着手训练技术力量，并全面安排了劳力。
