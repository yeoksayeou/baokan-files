Xinhua News Agency, September 30th: Prime Minister U Nu said today that the Sino-Burmese boundary negotiations have been very successfully completed, and the leaders of the Chinese and Burmese governments are now about to sign the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. The leaders of the two governments have complete confidence not only in this treaty but also in the reality, effectiveness, and durability of the mutual friendship and trust between the two countries. This is an achievement of which both our countries can be proud.

Prime Minister U Nu made these remarks at a welcome meeting held in his honor at Peking University. This afternoon, Prime Minister U Nu and some members of the Burmese Federal Government Delegation, accompanied by Vice Premier of the State Council Xi Zhongxun and our Ambassador to Burma Li Yimang, visited Peking University. The distinguished guests were warmly welcomed by all faculty, students, and staff of Peking University. Today, Peking University's gates were adorned with palace lanterns and a huge banner reading "Welcome Prime Minister U Nu." Inside the campus, green trees, red flags, colorful flowers, and young men and women in festive attire, under the bright autumn sun, resembled a garden in full bloom. At 3:00 PM, when Prime Minister U Nu entered the campus, students lining the streets waved the national flags of China and Burma, cheering, playing music, and dancing. The faculty and students welcomed Prime Minister U Nu's second visit to Peking University with the warmth of welcoming an old friend. Thousands of faculty and students held a welcoming ceremony on campus. The President of Peking University, Lu Ping, delivered a speech first, warmly welcoming Prime Minister U Nu and the Burmese guests on behalf of all the faculty, students, and staff. Then, Prime Minister U Nu delivered a passionate speech, praising the complete success of the Sino-Burmese boundary negotiations and the traditional "Pauk-Phaw" (胞波) friendship between the peoples of China and Burma.

Prime Minister U Nu's speech repeatedly elicited warm applause.

Prime Minister U Nu concluded by enthusiastically shouting in Chinese:

Long live Chairman Mao!

Long live Chairman Liu!

Long live Premier Zhou!

Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!

Afterward, Prime Minister U Nu and other Burmese guests visited the teaching buildings and practice factories of the Department of Oriental Languages, the Department of Chemistry, and the Department of Biology at Peking University. At each location, Prime Minister U Nu engaged in cordial conversations with some of the students, including two Burmese students. He wished them the fulfillment of their aspirations and excellent academic performance. Students lined up along the paths and in front of the buildings, continuously waving bouquets and chanting: "Welcome Prime Minister U Nu," "Long Live Sino-Burmese Friendship." Some students waved to the guests from the windows. The students also presented Prime Minister U Nu with two large radishes, which they had grown themselves in the campus's open spaces.

At 5:00 PM, Prime Minister U Nu shook hands with the faculty and students of Peking University amidst cheers and said goodbye.

Xinhua News Agency, September 30th: Prime Minister U Nu's Speech at the Welcome Meeting at Peking University

Students of Peking University,

I am always extremely pleased to see the vigorous, enthusiastic, and youthful faces that reflect the spirit of exploration and the pursuit of knowledge. Today, I have this rare opportunity to speak to you, the students of Peking University, in an atmosphere of utmost sincerity, and this pleasant feeling has reached its peak. I thank your school authorities for giving me this opportunity, and I also thank you all for giving me such a warm welcome. I can sincerely say that the eagerness and the pleasant desire I had in anticipation of meeting you has now been fulfilled.

Young "Pauk-Phaw" of Peking University,

You are undoubtedly aware of the purpose of my visit to your great country at the invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of China and Premier Zhou Enlai. This is a memorable and historically significant event for both countries. For centuries, Burma and China, as neighbors, have had close and generally cordial relations. The Chinese and Burmese peoples have been engaging in extremely friendly and mutually beneficial cultural and economic exchanges. Throughout these centuries, they have regarded each other as relatives. The Burmese commonly refer to the Chinese as "Pauk-Phaw," which means "relatives." But until now, the boundary between China and Burma has not been precisely demarcated in a manner satisfactory to both sides or with the free and formal agreement of both countries. You will also agree that this situation is inappropriate, as it can lead to misunderstandings and unintentional friction even among the best of neighbors. China and Burma would not agree to any agreement imposed on either side through any form of pressure. The solution must be satisfactory to both countries, and such a solution can only be reached through negotiations and the free and sincere exchange of views. Such negotiations have now been successfully completed, and the leaders of the two governments are now able to sign the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. They have complete confidence not only in this treaty but also in the reality, effectiveness, and durability of the mutual friendship and trust between the two countries. This is an achievement of which both our countries can be justly proud. The attainment of such an achievement fully demonstrates the far-sighted statesmanship of Premier Zhou Enlai, the goodwill, understanding, and sincerity shown by Mr. Yao Zhongming and the members of the Chinese delegation during the discussions, and the patient and diligent work carried out by the members of the Joint Boundary Committee and the Joint Survey Team. It can be said that since both sides possessed the goodwill, sincerity, and determination to seek a fair and reasonable solution, the successful outcome of the negotiations was predictable. Oh, this is precisely the crux of the matter. Whether between individuals or between nations, the important factor is to ensure that goodwill, sincerity, friendly feelings, and mutual trust exist and are manifested to such an extent that they remain firm and unwavering even when difficulties arise and discussions reveal apparent differences. The negotiations between our two countries, which have led to an agreement, have been very sincere from beginning to end. We encountered some difficulties, but thanks to the atmosphere filled with sincerity and goodwill, these difficulties were overcome. We can regard this as a universal principle: only in the presence of goodwill, sincerity, friendship, and mutual trust is it possible for an attitude of mutual concession to emerge, thereby paving the way for the success of negotiations. It is precisely because China and Burma have this goodwill, sincerity, friendship, and mutual trust that they have finally resolved the boundary issue that has existed for centuries.

Young "Pauk-Phaw" of Peking University,

As university students, you will undoubtedly play a very important role in the life of your country. Soon you will be standing at the forefront of those who are working to build a great and prosperous nation. Soon you will be effectively assisting your country in moving forward with ever-increasing strides and achieving ever-greater leaps in realizing your national goals. You are the future leaders of your country, and one day, the fate of your country will be in your hands, to be decided by you. As those who will participate in the construction of the magnificent edifice of your country's life in the future, you should be deeply aware of another magnificent edifice that has already been built, and you will also be responsible, together with others, for this edifice. I am referring to the edifice of sincere friendship, goodwill, and mutual trust between our two countries that has now been built, the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty being the symbol and proof of the completion of this edifice. Your task, just like the task of university students and others in my own country, should be to ensure that this magnificent edifice, this brilliant lighthouse, this milestone of friendship and mutual trust will endure forever. A sacred responsibility is placed in your hands. I am fully confident that you will do your utmost to keep this magnificent edifice of friendship between our two countries as vibrant and radiant as it was originally. The enthusiasm generated by this mutual friendship must never be allowed to lose its momentum, and a large part of the responsibility for maintaining this momentum will inevitably fall on you, the university students who are the future leaders of your country. Maintaining this magnificent edifice of mutual friendship is a great and noble task, and I believe that as long as you think of this task, you will gain a strength to inspire you to reach the highest peaks of achievement in your studies and training. I hope that, because you are aware that you will join us in forever maintaining the brilliance of the magnificent edifice of friendship and mutual trust between our two countries, you will inevitably make even greater efforts in your daily work.

Young "Pauk-Phaw" of Peking University,

I am very happy and very honored to have this opportunity to speak to you. I thank you for listening to me with politeness and enthusiasm. I wish you success in achieving your goals in your academic pursuits and training, so that your efforts will benefit your country and the mutual friendship between our two countries.

Long live Chairman Mao!

Long live Chairman Liu!

Long live Premier Zhou!

Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!

    吴努总理参观北京大学并发表讲话说
    中缅边界谈判取得圆满结果
    据新华社30日讯　吴努总理今天说，中缅边界谈判已经很圆满地完成，中缅两国政府领导人现在就要签订中缅边界条约。两国政府领导人不仅对这个条约，而且对两国之间的相互友谊和信任的现实性、有效性和持久性有完全的信心，这是我们两国足以自豪的成就。
    吴努总理是在北京大学对他的欢迎会上讲这番话的。今天下午，吴努总理和缅甸联邦政府代表团的部分团员。在国务院副总理习仲勋、我国驻缅甸大使李一氓的陪同下，参观了北京大学。贵宾们受到了北京大学全体师生员工极其热烈的欢迎。今天，北京大学校门上悬着宫灯，挂着“欢迎吴努总理”的巨幅标语。校园内，绿树、红旗、彩花和穿着节日服装的青年男女，在明丽的秋阳下，如同满园春花。下午三点，当吴努总理走进校园的时候，夹道欢迎的学生摇着中缅两国国旗欢呼，奏乐吹笙，翩翩起舞。师生们以欢迎老朋友的心情欢迎吴努总理第二次来北京大学。数千名师生在校园里举行了欢迎会。北京大学校长陆平首先致词，他代表全校师生员工，热烈欢迎吴努总理和缅甸贵宾们。　  接着，吴努总理发表了热情洋溢的讲话，盛赞中缅边界谈判的圆满成功，盛赞中缅两国人民传统的“胞波”友谊。
    吴努总理的讲话，一次又一次地引起了热烈的掌声。
    吴努总理最后用中国话热情地高呼：
    毛主席万岁！
    刘主席万岁！
    周总理万岁！
    中缅友谊万岁！
    接着，吴努总理等缅甸贵宾们参观了北京大学东语系、化学系、生物系等教学大楼和实习工厂。每到一处，吴努总理都和一些学生进行了亲切的谈话，还和两名缅甸留学生谈了话，他祝学生们的愿望圆满实现，祝他们成绩优良。列队在甬道旁和楼前的学生，不断摇着花束高呼：“欢迎吴努总理”、“中缅友好万岁”，有的学生从楼窗口向贵宾招手。学生们还赠给了吴努总理两个大萝卜，这是他们在校园空隙地上自己种的。
    下午五点，吴努总理在欢呼声中和北京大学师生握手告别。
    新华社30日讯　吴努总理在北京大学欢迎会上的讲话北京大学的同学们，
    每当我看到反映着探索精神和求知活动的生气勃勃的、热切的、年轻的面孔的时候，我总是感到极其高兴。今天，我有这个难得的机会在极其诚挚的气氛中向你们，北京大学的同学们讲话，这种愉快的心情真是达到了极点。我感谢你们学校当局给我这个机会，我还要感谢你们大家给我热情的欢迎。我可以诚恳地说，我迫切期待与你们见面的热切和愉快的愿望现在已经如愿以偿了。
    北京大学的年轻的“胞波”们，
    你们无疑是知道我应中华人民共和国政府和周恩来总理的邀请而来到你们伟大的国家的目的的。这对两国来说都是值得纪念的和有历史意义的事情。若干世纪以来，作为邻居的缅甸和中国一直有着密切的、一般来说很亲切的关系。中国人民和缅甸人民在文化和经济方面一直进行着极友好的和互利的交流。在这些世纪中，他们彼此以亲戚相看待。缅甸人俗语称中国人为“胞波”，就是“亲戚”的意思。但是直到现在以前，中国和缅甸之间的边界一直没有能在双方都满意的情况下或者两国自由地正式地取得一致意见的情况下精确地划定。你们也会认为，这种情况是不相宜的，因为这种情况即使在很好的邻邦间也会引起误会和出于无意的磨擦。中国和缅甸都不会赞同通过任何压力强加于任何一方的协定。解决办法必须是两国都感到满意的，这种解决办法只有通过谈判和自由地、真诚地交换意见才能达成。这样的谈判现在已经圆满地完成，两国政府的领导人现在能够签订中缅边界条约，他们不仅对这个条约，而且对两国之间的相互友谊和信任的现实性、有效性和持久性有完全的信心，这是我们两国足以自豪的成就。这样的成就的取得充分说明了周恩来总理的富有远见的政治家风度，姚仲明先生以及中国代表团团员在讨论过程中所表现的善意、谅解和诚意，以及边界联合委员会和联合勘察队成员所进行的耐心的和辛勤的工作。可以说既然双方都有了谋求公平合理解决问题的善意、诚意和决心，谈判取得圆满的结果本来是事先就能预料到的。哦，这正是问题的中心所在。无论是在人与人之间还是在国与国之间，重要的因素是保证善意、诚意、友好的感情和相互信任存在和表现到如此的程度，即使在发生了困难、讨论有了明显的分歧的时候仍然保持坚定和毫不动摇。已经导致协议的我们两国之间的谈判自始至终都是非常诚挚的。我们碰到了一些困难，但是由于洋溢着诚挚和善意的气氛，这些困难都被克服了。我们可以把这一点看做是一个普遍的准则：只有在有着善意、诚意、友谊和相互信任的情况下，才有可能出现互让的态度，从而为谈判的成功铺平道路。中国和缅甸正是由于有着这种善意、诚意、友谊和互相信任而终于解决了存在若干世纪之久的边界问题。
    北京大学的年轻的“胞波”们，
    作为大学生，你们将在你们国家生活中起很重大的作用，这是不言自明的道理。不久你们就要站在那些为建设一个伟大强盛的国家而劳动着的人们的最前列。不久你们就要有效地帮助你们的国家在实现你们的国家目标方面以愈来愈大的步伐前进，取得愈来愈大的跃进。你们是你们国家的未来的领袖，将来有一天，你们国家的命运将掌握在你们手中，由你们来决定。作为将来参加建设你们国家生活的宏伟大厦的人，你们应该深切地意识到现在已经建成了的另一座宏伟的大厦，你们也将要同其他人一起合作对这座大厦担负责任。我指的是现在已经建成的我们两国之间的真诚友谊、善意和互相信任的大厦，中缅条约的签订就是这座大厦建成的象征和证明。你们的任务，正如同我自己的国家的大学生和其他人的任务一样，应当是确保这座宏伟的大厦，这座光芒万丈的灯塔，这个友谊和相互信任的里程碑万古长存，放在你们手中的是一项神圣的责任。我完全相信你们会尽你们的力量来使我们两国之间的这座宏伟的友谊大厦保持它原有的鲜艳和光辉。决不能让这种相互的友谊所产生的热情失去它的动力，而要保持这种动力，很大一部分责任必然落在你们作为你们国家的未来领导人的大学生身上。维护这座相互的友谊的宏伟大厦是一项伟大而崇高的任务，我相信，你们只要一想到这项任务，就会得到一种力量，来鼓舞你们走向学习和训练方面的成就的最高峰。我希望，由于你们意识到将同我们一道永远保持我们两国之间的友谊和相互信任的宏伟大厦的光辉，你们就会不由得在你们的日常工作中作出更大的努力。
    北京大学的年轻的“胞波”们，
    我能有这个机会对你们讲话，感到非常高兴，非常荣幸。我感谢你们以有礼貌的和热情的态度听我讲话。祝你们成功地达到你们的学术事业和训练的目标，而使你们的努力对你们的国家和我们两国之间的相互友谊有所裨益。
    毛主席万岁！
    刘主席万岁！
    周总理万岁！
    中缅友谊万岁！（附图片）
