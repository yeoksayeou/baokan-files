Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The Korean People's Army Ensemble held its opening ceremony and first performance of its visit to China tonight in Beijing.

Chairman Zhu De, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Marshal Ye Jianying, together with the Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yong-ho, watched the performance.

Tonight, in front of the balcony of the Tianqiao Theater, hung a banner written in both Chinese and Korean: "Long Live the unbreakable internationalist unity of the Chinese and Korean people and their armies!" The hall was filled with spectators. In addition, the people of Beijing were also enjoying the artistic performances of the Korean People's Army Ensemble artists through the live broadcast of the performance by the Central People's Broadcasting Station and Beijing Television. The actors of the Korean People's Army Ensemble traveled across mountains, rivers, and battlefields during the war years, using their songs and dances to encourage the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to bravely kill the enemy and establish meritorious services. They have also performed abroad many times, earning high praise and acclaim internationally. This literary and artistic force composed of soldiers of the Korean People's Army not only brought rich and colorful literary and artistic programs to the Chinese audience but also brought the deep friendship of the Korean people and army. Tonight, the people of the capital watched their performance with infinite excitement and gratitude.

Before the performance, an opening ceremony was held. General Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Major General Zhang Ruihuan, Head of the Korean People's Army Ensemble, spoke at the opening ceremony.

On behalf of the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China and all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, General Xiao Hua extended a warm welcome to the Korean People's Army Ensemble. He said that the friendly visit to our country by our closest comrades-in-arms, the Korean People's Army Ensemble, led by Major General Zhang Ruihuan, not only adds luster to the historically significant day of "October 25th" but will also further consolidate and develop the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.

General Xiao Hua said that China and North Korea are fraternal neighbors as closely related as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. In the long struggle against common enemies, the people of our two countries have forged a profound friendship that shares life and death. As stated in the farewell letter of the Chinese People's Volunteers when they withdrew from Korea in 1958: "Our friendship cannot be compared to the height of mountains, nor to the depth of the sea, rivers and streams should sing its praises, and even wood and stone should be moved."

General Xiao Hua wished the Korean People's Army Ensemble a successful visit and performance in China.

At the opening ceremony, Major General Zhang Ruihuan expressed his respect to the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the former Chinese People's Volunteers. He said that ten years ago, during our most difficult period, the Chinese people sent their outstanding sons and daughters to the Korean front line, assisting us with their blood. The Chinese People's Volunteers, with the spirit of defending their motherland, defended every high ground and village of ours, and until the last day of their return from Korea, they always sincerely loved our people and resolutely implemented the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong's instructions to cherish every mountain, river, tree, and blade of grass in Korea, demonstrating the noble qualities of internationalist fighters. Our people and army will never forget the Chinese People's Volunteers. Major General Zhang Ruihuan said that the firm friendship and unity between our two peoples and armies is a powerful force to ensure peace and shatter the aggressive policies of American imperialism. Our people will certainly be able to force the American imperialists to get out of the southern half of our motherland; and we firmly believe that Taiwan will surely return to the embrace of the Chinese people.

The speeches of General Xiao Hua and Major General Zhang Ruihuan were warmly applauded by the audience. Amidst thunderous applause, members of the Cultural Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army presented flowers to the head, deputy head, and actor representatives of the Korean People's Army Ensemble. Entrusted by the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, the Korean People's Army Ensemble presented a banner to the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

At 7:50 p.m., the performance began. As the crimson velvet curtain slowly opened, rows of heroic warriors wearing medals on their chests began the chorus of the "Volunteer Army Battle Song" on the grand chorus stage. In "Wind and Snow," one of the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Suite, they sang of the fighting path taken by the anti-Japanese guerrillas led by General Kim Il-sung during the Anti-Japanese War, braving the bitter cold and snow, climbing over high mountains and ridges, and fighting bravely with the enemy, to liberate their motherland and realize the great communist ideal. In the chorus "Marching to the Decisive Battlefield," they sang of the people who went to the battlefield in the war against American imperialist aggression, to eliminate the enemy and recover the territory. Their dance, "Warriors in the Dense Forest," the song "Eagle Peak Ballad," and many other programs reflected the great victory against American imperialist aggression and the revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism of the Korean People's Army.

During the performance, such a thrilling and moving scene appeared before the audience: in front of the backdrop of the battlefield scene filled with smoke and flames, a pair of Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer soldiers fought side by side, back to back, tearing and wrestling with the enemy. The People's Army soldier was injured, and the Volunteer Army soldier blocked the enemy; a bullet hit the Volunteer Army soldier's chest, and the People's Army soldier grabbed the gun butt and repelled the enemy's attack. This was a scene from the dance "Comrades." Many programs performed tonight also praised the friendship between the peoples and armies of Korea and China forged with blood. For example, the dance "Reunion on the Highland" and the chorus "Filled with Friendship" expressed the deep friendship between comrades-in-arms, comrades, and brothers between the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

The Korean People's Army Ensemble also reproduced the magnificent scenes and joyful moods of the Korean people's socialist construction today on the Chinese stage: workers on construction sites sang boldly about the Korean "Chollima" movement; on joyous harvest days, young Korean rural girls danced gracefully. The Korean classical dance "Phoenix Fan Dance," which won first prize at the 7th World Youth Peace and Friendship Festival, expressed the feelings of the Korean people today with revolutionary romanticism: in the past, it was said that heaven was good, but now the world is better than heaven. How much the girls who sing and dance lightly under the beautiful peaks love their motherland.

The artists of the Korean People's Army not only performed many programs familiar and loved by the Chinese audience but also performed Chinese dances and sang Chinese songs in Chinese.

The Korean People's Army Ensemble's first performance in China was warmly welcomed. The theater hall was boiling with excitement from time to time, and applause thundered. Many programs were replayed many times at the enthusiastic request of the audience, and many performances were curtained three or four times.

During the intermission, Chairman Zhu De and Chen Yi, Xi Zhongxun, Guo Moruo, Ye Jianying, and others met with Major General Zhang Ruihuan, head of the Korean People's Army Ensemble, Colonel Cui Changyin, deputy head, Lieutenant Colonel Jin Bingchun, and leading actors, and had a cordial conversation. At the end of the performance, they went to the stage, shook hands with the actors cordially, and presented flower baskets to the ensemble.

Also watching tonight's performance were General Tan Zheng, Admiral Xiao Jingguang, Admiral Su Zhenhua, Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Lieutenant General Wu Faxian of the Air Force, and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, officers and literary and art workers from the army, navy, and air force stationed in Beijing, as well as General Li Zhimin, former political commissar of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and combat heroes of the former Volunteers.

Also watching the performance were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Culture Xia Yan, Deputy Directors of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Zhang Zhixiang and Qu Wu, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Zhou Yang, Vice Presidents of the China-Korea Friendship Association Lao She and Wei Chuantong, Vice Mayor of Beijing Le Songsheng, and famous people from all walks of life in the capital.

    今天晚上，天桥剧场楼厅看台前面，悬挂着用中朝两国文字写的“中朝两国人民及其军队牢不可破的国际主义团结万岁！”的横幅标语，大厅里坐满了观众。此外，北京市人民今晚通过中央人民广播电台和北京电视台的演出实况转播，也在欣赏朝鲜人民军协奏团艺术家们的艺术表演。朝鲜人民军协奏团的演员们，在战争岁月里越高山、涉大河、走遍战场，用他们的歌舞鼓舞着朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军英勇杀敌、建立功勋。他们并多次到国外演出，获得国际上很高的评价和赞誉。这支由朝鲜人民军战士组成的文艺大军，不仅为中国观众带来了富丽多彩的文艺节目，还带来了朝鲜人民和军队的深情厚谊。今天首都人民怀着无限激动和感谢的心情，来观看他们的演出。
    在演出前，举行了演出开幕式。中国人民解放军总政治部副主任萧华上将和朝鲜人民军协奏团团长张瑞焕少将，先后在开幕式上讲了话。
    萧华上将代表中华人民共和国国防部和中国人民解放军全体官兵，向朝鲜人民军协奏团表示热烈欢迎。他说，我们最亲密的战友——朝鲜人民军协奏团在张瑞焕少将率领下来我国进行友好访问，不仅使“十·二五”这个有着重大历史意义的日子增添了不少光彩，而且一定会使中朝人民的战斗友谊得到进一步的巩固和发展。
    萧华上将说，中朝两国是唇齿相依，休戚与共的兄弟邻邦。在长期反对共同敌人的斗争中，我们两国人民结成了同生死、共患难的深厚友谊。正如中国人民志愿军在1958年撤离朝鲜时的告别信上所说的：“我们的这种友谊，山不能比其高，海不能比其深，河川也要歌颂，木石也要动心。”
    萧华上将预祝朝鲜人民军协奏团在中国的访问演出胜利成功。
    张瑞焕少将在演出开幕式上，向中国人民以及中国人民解放军和前中国人民志愿军表示敬意。他说，十年前，在我们最艰难的时期，中国人民将自己的优秀儿女派到朝鲜前线，以鲜血援助了我们。中国人民志愿军用捍卫自己祖国一样的精神，坚守了我们的每一个高地和村庄，一直到从朝鲜归国的最后一天为止，一贯真挚地爱戴我国人民，坚决执行中国共产党和毛泽东主席的爱护朝鲜一山一水一草一木的指示，表现了国际主义战士的高贵品质。我国人民和军队永远不会忘记中国人民志愿军。张瑞焕少将说，我们两国人民和军队之间的牢固的友谊团结，是保障和平粉碎美帝国主义的侵略政策的强大力量。我国人民一定能迫使美帝国主义者滚出我们祖国的南半部；并且深信，台湾也一定会回到中国人民的怀抱。
    萧华上将和张瑞焕少将的讲话，受到观众的热烈鼓掌。在雷动的掌声中，中国人民解放军总政治部文工团的团员向朝鲜人民军协奏团的团长、副团长以及演员代表献了花。朝鲜人民军协奏团受朝鲜人民军官兵委托向中国人民解放军赠送了锦旗。
    十九点五十分，演出开始。当金丝绒的红色幕布徐徐拉开后，大合唱台上，胸前挂着奖章的一排排英武勇士，开始了“志愿军战歌”的大合唱。他们在抗日游击队组曲之一的“风雪”中，歌唱了在抗日战争年代，金日成将军领导的抗日游击队员们，为了解放祖国，为了实现伟大的共产主义理想，冒着严寒和风雪，爬越高山峻岭，与敌人进行英勇搏斗所走过的战斗道路。他们在“走向决战场”合唱中，歌唱了在反对美帝国主义侵略战争中，为了消灭敌人、为了收复国土而走向战场的人们。他们的舞蹈：“密林中的勇士”、歌唱：“鹰峰山谣”以及许多节目，都反映了反对美帝国主义侵略的伟大胜利，反映了朝鲜人民军的革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义精神。
    演出当中，在观众面前出现了这样一个惊心动魄、可歌可泣的场面：在弥漫着浓烟烈火的战场情景背幕前，一对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战士，肩并肩、背靠背地同敌人撕杀、搏斗，人民军战士负了伤，志愿军战士挡住了敌人；子弹打中了志愿军战士的胸口，人民军战士抢起枪托，打退了敌人的进攻。这是舞蹈“战友”中的一个场面。今晚演出的节目中，还有许多歌颂了朝中两国人民军队以鲜血凝成的友谊。如舞蹈“高地重逢”合唱“满载着友谊”等，都表达了朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军之间战友、同志、兄弟的深情厚谊。
    朝鲜人民军协奏团还将今天朝鲜人民进行社会主义建设的宏伟场面和喜悦心情，再现在中国舞台上：建筑工地上的工人，在豪放地歌唱着朝鲜“千里马”运动；喜庆丰收的日子里，朝鲜农村少女翩翩起舞。在第七届世界青年和平友谊联欢节获得一等奖的朝鲜古典舞蹈“凤扇舞”，以革命浪漫主义的艺术表现方法，表达了朝鲜人民今天的心情：过去都说天堂好，如今人间赛天堂，在秀丽的山峰下轻歌漫舞的姑娘们，是多么热爱她们祖国的土地。
    朝鲜人民军的艺术家们，不仅演出了许多为中国观众所熟悉、所热爱的节目，而且表演了中国的舞蹈、用中国语言，唱了中国歌曲。
    朝鲜人民军协奏团的访华首次演出，受到了热烈欢迎。剧场大厅里，时而沸腾起来，掌声雷动。许多节目在观众热烈要求下，多次重演，不少演出谢幕三、四次之多。
    演出中间休息时，朱德委员长和陈毅、习仲勋、郭沫若、叶剑英等，接见了朝鲜人民军协奏团团长张瑞焕少将，副团长崔昌殷上校、金炳淳中校和主要演员，并进行了亲切的谈话。演出结束时，他们上到舞台与演员们亲切握手，并向协奏团赠送了花篮。
