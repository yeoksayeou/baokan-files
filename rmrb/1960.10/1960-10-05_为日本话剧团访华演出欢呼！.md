    Hail the Japanese Theater Troupe's Visit to China!
    Tian Han
    The visit of the Japanese Theater Troupe to China has aroused great excitement among the people of Beijing and the Chinese literary and dramatic circles from the day they got off the train.

    Japanese theater (they call it "New Theater") has a history of fifty-four years, starting from 1906 when Shoyo Tsubouchi organized the "Literary Association," while our spoken drama started from 1907 when Comrade Yuqian Ouyang and others performed "Uncle Tom's Cabin" in Tokyo. We are younger brothers to them. Although our spoken drama was influenced by our traditional opera in its early days, we learned a lot from the Japanese "New School Drama" or "New Drama." If the progressive and revolutionary Japanese New Drama workers have been engaged in arduous struggles for Japan's democracy and progress for a long time, the progressive and revolutionary Chinese spoken drama workers have explicitly used their art as a powerful weapon against imperialism and feudalism. Many drama workers have contributed everything, even their lives, in the struggle. In this sense, Chinese and Japanese spoken drama workers are truly "brothers in distress." The victory of the Chinese revolution has provided conditions for the smooth development of Chinese spoken drama under the people's regime, while Japanese spoken drama workers have to continue their fierce and bitter struggle under double oppression. As the hardworking, brave, and intelligent Japanese people, these drama workers have achieved many excellent achievements even under long-term difficult conditions. They have created many highly artistic scripts, accumulated a lot of experience in directing and acting, and their stage design and lighting technology have some unique features. They often keenly absorb the better things from Western Europe to enrich themselves, and they have also begun to pay attention to their excellent drama traditions.

    Their performances in Beijing quite centrally demonstrated these superiorities, forming a small exhibition of the rich and colorful Japanese spoken drama art, and also a good mirror of the lives and struggles of the Japanese people today, which is worth our good appreciation and learning.

    This time, the Japanese Theater Troupe visiting China performed three major plays and three recitation plays. The three major plays are "Yuzuru" (Evening Crane) (by Junji Kinoshita), "Dead Sea" (by Tomoyoshi Murayama), and "A Woman's Life" (by Kaoru Morimoto). "Yuzuru" is the signature play of the Grape Society; "A Woman's Life" is the most performed play by the Literary Theater; "Dead Sea" was written during the struggle against the Japan-US "Security Treaty," directed by Koreya Senda, and jointly performed by the main actors of the Mingei, Haiyuza, and Tokyo Art Theater, including actors from other theater groups. These three plays gave us extremely fresh and profound impressions.

      "Yuzuru" was performed as the opening program. This is Junji Kinoshita's famous work based on folk tales. Miss Yasue Yamamoto has been shaping the image of the beautiful and innocent Otsu with her superb acting skills for eleven years. She is angry at the insidious destruction of her and Yohei's happy life by merchants like Old So (Saku); she feels very disappointed and incomprehensible at Yohei, who she has always loved, suddenly becoming so cold. Even the children next door singing around her cannot distract her from her sorrow; but when she sees her husband's sleeping face, she decides to sacrifice a few feathers to satisfy his request. Miss Yamamoto performed very sincerely and movingly in these places. Mr. Shoichi Kuwayama, who played Yohei, profoundly portrayed a selfish and foolish farmer, but still did not let this young farmer lose his simplicity as a working people. Although Yohei is also the object of criticism in this play, he is still different from those profit-seeking merchants. In the end, he hugged the brocade and cried out his wife's name "Otsu! Otsu!" to the sky, without making the products woven with Otsu's blood and tears become commodities for merchants to make huge profits.

    We all sympathize with Otsu—that innocent crane who repays kindness. When she asks Yohei to only love her and stay with her forever, and Yohei stubbornly wants money, Otsu says, "Why do you want money so much?" "Is money something that people want so much?" "Are you... do you love money more than you love me?" The poor crane living in the sky does not know that in a private ownership society, "whoever has it can control everything he wants." It is "the destroyer of economic order and moral order," and it can "confuse the hearts of the wise and make him do ugly things." (See "Capital" Volume One, Chapter Three). Otsu only has a naive fantasy of love, and this is her tragedy.

    Through this play, the author expressed his views on capitalist society, and unconsciously revealed a dark mood, but he still has a high trust in the pure hearts of children.

      "Auntie, Auntie, sing for us,
    Auntie, Auntie, play with us."
    Otsu will never forget the voices of these children's infinite concern, so she will still have ardent expectations for the future of human society. (In addition to Yasuko Ushigome, the rest of the children are all students from the Beijing Dance School. They quickly learned to sing Japanese songs and speak simple words, and the emotional exchange with the main actors was also very good, which is rare.) The entire performance of "Yuzuru" is simple and unadorned, full of Japanese national style, which is the masterpiece of the late famous director Shiro Okakura. Mr. Okakura visited China with the Japanese Theater Delegation four years ago. Unfortunately, he passed away in the second year after returning to his country and was unable to see the performance of this play in China, which is really regrettable!

    The second major play is "Dead Sea." The entire play is set in a fishing village in Choshi, Chiba, Japan. It tells that the fishermen here originally made a living by catching a large number of sardines. Since the reactionary government of Nobusuke Kishi provided this place to American imperialism as a military base, set up rows of anti-aircraft guns on the coast, and frequently conducted live ammunition shooting, the sardines, which are timid, were all frightened away. The fishermen's catch is small, and the fishery capitalists have swallowed up the public funds that should be given to the fishermen, making it even more difficult for the poor fishermen to survive. Local party members Toshio Kanazawa, Shinzo Yajima, etc. originally wanted to launch a resistance movement because the shipowners did not provide treatment for their sick partners, but later felt that these small economic struggles must be developed into political struggles to achieve victory. Therefore, they told everyone that after the parliament passed the new Japan-US "Security Treaty," the fishermen would suffer greater disasters. Without carrying out the struggle against military bases and overthrowing American imperialism, the fishermen would have no way out and could not defeat the large fishery capitalists. Therefore, a signature campaign against "Anpo" was launched in the fishing village, and at the same time, the shipowner Kamiya was exposed for embezzling public funds. In this way, the struggle in this fishing village broke out and became part of the entire great anti-American patriotic struggle, which could not be stopped by those lackeys. Shinzo immediately joined the struggle after his marriage. The "Dead Sea," which was once shrouded in dark clouds, became active again!

    This is a play with strong practical significance. Because it adopts a combination of film and drama, and describes it vertically and horizontally from the whole to the part, it appears even more magnificent. (Although lush branches and leaves sometimes inevitably obscure the roots.) All the actors are full of revolutionary feelings. Takizawa Osamu, a veteran of the Japanese theater world who played Guan Hanqing, naturally played the role of Communist Party member Shinzo Yajima with ease. Akiki Sumikawa played by Kishihiko, Sunjuro Kamiya played by Masao Shimizu, Sasajima played by Kiyoshi Nagata, and Fukuko played by Sumiko Kiyosu all played their sophisticated acting skills. Toshio Kanazawa played by Tsutomu Shimomoto, and Kimiko played by Michiko Otsuka are all very fresh and lively. Famous actors such as Haruko Sugimura and Tanie Kitabayashi played some minor roles, showing a good and worthy of learning work style.

      In the play "A Woman's Life," Haruko Sugimura, who played Kui Nunobiki, played the different identities of "Little Miss," "Young Mistress," and "Madam" who escaped into the Tsutsumi family at the age of sixteen, until she was an old woman in her sixties living alone among the ruins. This is a role that is very conducive to actors to display their multifaceted talents, and Ms. Haruko Sugimura brought this role to life.

    We also admire Makiko Kitashiro, who played the role of Kui's mother-in-law, Fumiko Tsutsumi. Her acting skills are so natural, calm, and without any fire. Shizu Shimizu's Shoosuke is also played mature and well-rounded. Nobuko Tashiro's Fusako and Akiko Bunno's Tomie are very outstanding.

    Except for the prologue and epilogue, which are exterior scenes, the other five acts of this play use the same interior scene of the Tsutsumi family's guest room. Due to the different eras, different arrangements, and changes in the characters' dress, different atmospheres are revealed. In the end, Kui Nunobiki's husband returns home and happens to be scattering beans at the beginning of spring. He recites something like "Demons go away, gods of fortune come in," which also shows the declining mood of this dying class.

    All three recitation plays are very good, one about the strike in the Miike coal mine; one about the anti-American movement in Okinawa; and one set in Tokyo, recording the struggle against the Japan-US "Security Treaty." The three plays are all very strong in ideology and artistry. This is a kind of living newspaper play mainly based on recitation and chorus, which was introduced from the Soviet Union to Germany after the war. "The Record of the Struggle Against the Japan-US 'Security Treaty'" fully demonstrated the development of the united front of various social strata jointly opposing the United States and Kishi. They not only used slides and movies, but in the end, the actors also walked off the stage in two lines and became one with the audience, expressing high revolutionary feelings.

    In order to celebrate the victory of the Japanese Theater Troupe's performance in our capital, I would like to put forward the following points as my wishes to them:

    (1) The plays they performed this time all have direct or indirect anti-imperialist significance, and have achieved the combination of art and politics. As long as the two are always closely combined, so that the spoken drama serves the new Japan in striving for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality, Japanese spoken drama will inevitably emit greater brilliance.

    (2) They are a group composed of five theater groups with different histories and artistic styles, but from the time they entered China, the impression they gave us was like a group of one person, supporting and cooperating with each other, regardless of each other. This is something extremely worth learning from us. Indeed, only if we further unite and struggle can we achieve victory politically and artistically.

    (3) These artists, from the time they rehearsed in the Capital Theater, have always shown seriousness and conscientiousness in their artistic work. In order to strive for a more powerful performance, they do not relax any technical details. This impression is also extremely profound for us. Only by constantly improving the ideological and artistic level of drama can our works be obtained by the broad masses and play a huge social role. We must seize the opportunity to learn from Japanese drama artists better. We must move forward together and strengthen the fraternal relationship of fighting for the light.

    I wrote a few poems to congratulate them on the great success of their performances in China.

    "Yuzuru"
    Evening Crane ultimately succumbed to money; the heartbreaking world and times
    Thousands of feathers woven into splendid clouds, ten thousand shuttles squandered her jade-like skin.
    When should the sword be drawn to punish the philistines? When freed from the cage, one should remember the singing children.
    Most pitiful, flying alone for thousands of miles, speckles of blood and tears red in the frosty sky.

      "Dead Sea"
    Sardines are weak and afraid of turbulent currents, the shore cannons roar and it is difficult to enter the net.
    In vain, the fishermen shed blood and sweat; traitors have always been heartless!
    How generous and impassioned are these young people, how the old and disabled call out in the wind and rain.
    How admirable is the grand farewell of the newlyweds. The dying Dead Sea stirs up a raging wave!

    "A Woman's Life"
    The poor girl was infatuated with the "God of Wealth"; she abandoned the comb to become Taro's wife.
    Marrying into the military to enrich herself was a clever plan; selling her uncle to secure the banks was not low.
    A generation of extravagance returned to the flames of war; a heart full of thoughts turned into spring mud.
    Those close still yearn for the dream of invading China, not as good as Kui Nunobiki who knew her mistakes.
    ① "Adu" refers to money ② "Ma Meng" means the God of Wealth.
 Three Recitation Plays
Demons walk on the Pacific Ocean, setting nets for our people again.
    Huge rocks are difficult to wither, but grass sprouts forth. The east wind blows and stirs up angry waves.
    The power of dragons, snakes, jackals, and tigers is reduced, the strength of workers, students, farmers, and merchants is increased.
    Moving forward without stopping, the song does not cease. The dawn will eventually shine on the mountains and rivers.

### 为日本话剧团访华演出欢呼！

    为日本话剧团访华演出欢呼！
    田汉
    日本话剧团访问中国，从他们下火车那天起，就引起北京人民和中国文艺戏剧界极大的兴奋。
    日本的话剧（他们叫“新剧”）从1906年坪内逍遥组织“文艺协会”算起，到现在有五十四年的历史，而我们的话剧是以1907年欧阳予倩同志等在东京演出《黑奴吁天录》算起的，我们是比他们年轻一些的兄弟。我们话剧创始期虽也有自己的传统戏曲的影响，但从日本“新派剧”或“新剧”学习过许多东西。如果说进步的、革命的日本新剧工作者曾长期为日本的民主进步进行着艰苦的斗争，进步的、革命的中国的话剧工作者更是明确地把他的艺术作为反帝、反封建斗争的有力武器。多少戏剧工作者在斗争中贡献了自己的一切甚至生命。在这个意义上中日两国话剧工作者真是“难兄难弟”。中国革命的胜利使中国话剧在人民政权下取得顺利发展的条件，而日本话剧工作者却不能不在双重压迫下继续着恶战苦斗。作为勤劳英勇智慧的日本人民，这些话剧工作者就在长期困难的条件下还是取得了许多优异的成就。他们创作了许多艺术性很高的剧本，他们在导演、表演艺术上积累了许多经验，他们的舞台装置和灯光技术有一些独出心裁的东西，他们常常很敏锐地吸收西欧较好的东西来丰富自己，他们也开始注意自己的优秀戏剧传统。
    他们在北京的演出相当集中地表现了这些优异性，形成了一个丰富多彩的日本话剧艺术的小型展览会，也是日本人民今天的生活和斗争的一面很好的镜子，值得我们很好地欣赏和借鉴。
    这次日本访华话剧团演出了三个大戏和三个朗诵剧。三个大戏是
  《夕鹤》（木下顺二作），《死海》
  （村山知义作）和《女人的一生》
  （森本熏作）。《夕鹤》是葡萄之会剧团的看家戏；《女人的一生》是文学座的演得最多的剧目；《死海》是在反对日美“安全条约”的斗争中写成的戏，由千田是也导演，民艺、俳优座、东京艺术座三个剧团的主要演员联合演出，其中也包含其他剧团的演员。这三个戏分别给了我们极为新鲜深刻的印象。
      《夕鹤》是作为开幕的节目演出的。这是木下顺二氏以民间故事为题材的成名之作。山本安英女士从十一年前就以卓越的演技塑造了美丽纯真的阿通的形象，她对商人老惣（朔）等阴险地破坏她和与平的幸福生活，感到愤怒；她对一向热爱的与平忽然变得那样冷酷，感到十分失望和不解，连邻家孩子们围着她唱歌都不能分散她的愁苦；但当她看到她丈夫的睡脸之后又决心牺牲自己几根羽毛来满足他的要求。在这些地方，山本女士都演得十分真切动人。演与平的桑山正一氏深刻地刻划了一个自私的愚戆的农民，但仍不让这位青年农民失去他作为劳动人民的纯朴性。与平在这个戏里虽也是批判的对象，但跟那些唯利是图的商人们还是不同的，他最后毕竟抱着那匹锦缎望着向天空飞去的仙鹤惨叫着他妻子的名字“阿通！阿通！”没有把阿通用血和泪织成的产品成为商人们牟取巨额利润的商品。
    我们都十分同情阿通——那天真的报恩的仙鹤。当她要求与平只爱她一个人，永远和她在一起，而与平执拗地想要钱的时候，阿通说
  “为什么那样想要钱呢？”“钱是一种那么让人想要的东西吗？”“你是那么样……比爱我还爱钱吗？”生活在天空的可怜的仙鹤就不知钱在私有制社会，“谁有它，谁就能支配他所欲的一切”它是“经济秩序和道德秩序的破坏者，”它能“迷惑贤人之心使他干丑恶的行为。”（见“资本论”第一篇第三章引语。）而阿通却只有着一种天真的爱的幻想，这就是她的悲剧。
    作者通过这个戏吐露了对资本主义社会的看法，无形中也流露一种阴暗的情绪，但是他对于儿童的纯真的心灵还是有着很高信赖的。
      “阿姨，阿姨，给我们唱歌吧，
    阿姨，阿姨，跟我们玩吧。”
    孩子们这种无限关切的声音阿通将永久不能忘记，因而她对人类社会的明天仍将寄以热烈的期望吧。（演这些孩子们的除了牛込安子以外，其余全是北京舞蹈学校的学生，他们很快就学会了唱日本歌和说简单的话，而且跟主要演员的感情交流也很好，真是难得。）《夕鹤》整个演出简洁朴素，富于日本民族风格，这是故名导演冈仓士朗先生的杰作。冈仓先生四年前曾和日本话剧代表团一起访问过中国，不幸于归国后的第二年去世了，没有能看到此剧在中国的演出，真是叫人怅惘的事！
    第二个大戏是《死海》。全剧以日本千叶铫子地方一个渔村为背景，写这里的渔民原以捕大量鰯鱼为生，自从岸信介反动政府把这里提供给美帝国主义作军事基地，在海岸设置一排排的高射炮，经常实弹射击，鰯鱼胆小都给惊走了。渔民捕获量少，渔业资本家又吞没应分给渔民的公款，穷苦渔民们更活不下去。当地党员金泽敏夫、矢岛新藏等原想因船主不给生病的伙伴治疗发起反抗运动，后来感到必须把这些小的经济斗争发展成为政治斗争才能取得胜利，因此告诉大家：议会通过新的日美“安全条约”之后渔民们将遭到更大的灾难，不进行反对军事基地和打倒美帝国主义的斗争，渔民们就没有出路，就不能战胜大渔业资本家。于是渔村中发动了反“安保”的签名运动，同时揭发了船主神谷盗用公款的事，这样这渔村的斗争就爆发成为整个伟大反美爱国斗争的一部分，不是那些狗腿子们所能阻挠的了。新藏在新婚之后也立即投入了斗争，一度阴云笼罩的“死海”重新活跃起来了！
    这是一个现实意义很强烈的戏，由于采取了电影与戏剧相结合的手法，从全体到局部纵横描写，更显得波澜壮阔。（虽则枝繁叶茂有时不免掩蔽根干。）全体演员革命感情都非常饱满。在日本演过关汉卿的剧坛老将泷泽修在这个戏里饰共产党员矢岛新藏自然是游刃有余。岸辉子的澄川阿吉，清水将夫的船王神谷孙十郎，永田清的笹岛，清洲澄子的福子等都发挥了老练的演技。下元勉的金泽敏夫和大冢道子的君子等都十分清新活泼。杉村春子和北林谷荣等名演员都扮一些次要的脚色，表现了很好的值得学习的工作作风。
        在《女人的一生》这个戏里饰布引奎的杉村春子，从一个十六岁逃入堤家过“小大姐”、“大少奶奶”、“太太”的不同身份，一直演到她年逾六十独自一个人住在颓垣断瓦间的老妇人的一生。这是一个十分有利于演员们发挥多面才能的角色，而杉村春子女士把这个角色给演活了。
    我们也十分钦佩演奎的婆婆堤倭文子的北城真记子。她的演技是那样自然、沉着、毫无火气。清水将夫的章介也演得老成圆到。田代信子的总子，文野明子的知荣都非常出色。
    这戏除序幕与尾声是外景外，其他五幕都用的堤家的客室这同一内景。因年代不同，布置不同，人物打扮有所改变，显出不同的气氛。最后布引奎的丈夫回家适逢立春撒豆，他念着什么“妖魔走开，福神进来”也表现了这个垂死阶级的没落情绪。
    三个朗诵剧都非常好，一个写三池煤矿的罢工；一个写冲绳岛的反美；一个以东京为背景，纪录了反对日美“安全条约”的斗争。三剧思想性和艺术性都很强。这是大战后由苏联传入德国的一种以朗诵、合唱为主的活报剧。《反对日美“安全条约斗争”的纪录》充分表现了各社会阶层共同反美反岸的统一战线的开展，他们不只运用了幻灯和电影，最后演员们还分两线走下舞台和观众打成一片，表现了高昂的革命感情。
    为了在庆贺日本话剧团在我首都公演的胜利，我想提出以下几点作为对他们的祝愿：
    （一）他们这次演出的剧目都直接间接有反帝的意义，做到了艺术与政治的结合。只要两者始终紧密结合，使话剧为争取和平、独立、民主、中立的新日本服务，日本话剧必然会发出更大的光彩。
    （二）他们系五个不同历史，不同艺术风格的剧团组成的团体，但从他们进入中国起，给我们的印象就像是一个团体一个人一样，互相支援合作，不分彼此。这是极值得我们学习的地方，的确只有我们进一步团结斗争才会在政治上艺术上取得胜利。
    （三）这些艺术家从他们在首都剧场排练的时候起，一直表现了对艺术工作的严肃认真，为了争取更有力的表现，他们不放松任何技术细节。这给我们的印象也极为深刻。我们只有不断提高戏剧思想艺术水平才能使我们的作品获得广大群众，发挥巨大的社会作用。我们一定更好地抓紧机会跟日本话剧艺术家们学习。我们一定要共同前进，加强为光明而战斗的兄弟关系。
    我写了几首诗，祝贺他们在中国演出的伟大成功。
    《夕　鹤》竟因阿堵①若阿通，肠断滔滔时世风。千羽织成云锦灿，万梭抛损玉肌丰。拔剑何当诛市侩，出笼应忆唱邻童。最怜万里孤飞去，点点霜天血泪红。
      《死　海》鰯鱼鱼弱畏惊湍，岸炮轰鸣入网难。空让渔民流血汗，从来国贼少心肝！帷灯慷慨几儿女，风雨呼号一老残。绝羡新婚成壮别，奄奄死海起狂澜！
    《女人的一生》贫女偏教“马猛”②迷，抛梳宁作太郎妻。结军肥己计良巧，卖叔安堤手不低。一代豪华归劫火，满腔心事化春泥。近人犹恋侵华梦，不及知非布引奎。①“阿堵”指钱②“马猛”财神之意。
  三个朗诵剧太平洋上走群魔，再向吾民设网罗。巨石难萎偏出草，东风吹起怒翻波，蛟蛇豺虎威风减，工学农商力量多。前进不停歌不息，曙光终得照山河。
