Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 21st:

The Japanese Communist Party's "Avant-Garde" magazine published an article in its latest issue entitled "The Essence of the Ikeda Cabinet's 'New Policies'," exposing the reactionary and deceptive nature of the Ikeda Cabinet's "new policies." The article pointed out that the Ikeda Cabinet is the "Second Kishi Cabinet" and called on the Japanese people to fight to the end to overthrow the Ikeda Cabinet and establish a democratic united government against the "Security Treaty."

The author of this article is Tsuyoshi Toki, head of the Central Economic Research Department of the Japanese Communist Party.

The article stated: "No matter how the Ikeda Cabinet publicizes its 'new policies' or how Prime Minister Ikeda puts on a 'low profile,' it cannot eliminate the unease and distrust that the people feel towards the Ikeda Cabinet."

The article pointed out: First, although the members of the Ikeda Cabinet are somewhat different from those of the Kishi Cabinet, the Ikeda Cabinet is composed of reactionary groups within the Liberal Democratic Party, such as Ikeda, Kishi Nobusuke, and Sato. These reactionary groups promoted traitorous and reactionary policies during the Kishi Cabinet. Second, as Prime Minister Ikeda himself boasted, he has "close friends" in the United States and in Japanese financial circles, and he is a direct descendant of Shigeru Yoshida, who sold Japanese sovereignty to the United States. Moreover, in the past, regardless of whether he was a cabinet member or not, he acted as the most loyal agent of the mainstream faction of American imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital groups. Third, the Ikeda Cabinet receives more comprehensive support from the United States and Japanese monopoly capital groups than they gave to the Kishi Cabinet.

The article pointed out: "Although the Ikeda Cabinet wants to pretend that it is not the second Kishi Cabinet, it is clear from the above points that it is not only the second Kishi Cabinet, but also a more dangerous traitorous and reactionary government than the Kishi Cabinet."

The article then exposed the purpose of the Ikeda Cabinet's so-called "Establishing parliamentary politics is the premise of all policies" slogan. The article said: Although the Ikeda Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party claim to defend parliamentary politics, their aim is not to truly establish parliamentary politics and defend democracy. Their main concern is, at present, to use words such as "democracy" and "tolerance towards opposition parties" to win over the Democratic Socialist Party and the Socialist Party, while preventing the people from seeing the real factors that undermined parliamentary politics in the Kishi Cabinet, evading the Liberal Democratic Party's political responsibility, and attempting to restore the Liberal Democratic Party's political prestige. They also aim to increase the Liberal Democratic Party's seats through general elections and further turn the parliament into a tool for the Liberal Democratic Party to implement dictatorship.

The article analyzed the Ikeda Cabinet's foreign policy, stating that the basic lines of the Ikeda Cabinet's foreign policy are: First, to regain the trust of American imperialism and gain the "respect" of the "free countries" led by the United States; second, to adopt a so-called diplomatic route that can make socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and China "feel afraid"; third, to consolidate a domestic system suitable for this route. That is to say, Japan should move in the direction of submitting to the United States, reviving militarism, and imperialism. The article said: Therefore, the Ikeda Cabinet's foreign policy is not "new" compared to the Kishi Cabinet's foreign policy, and it completely inherited the Kishi Cabinet's foreign policy line intact.

The article said that the biggest issue of the Ikeda government's foreign policy is to uphold the Japan-U.S. military alliance as the basic line of diplomacy, cooperate with the U.S. policy of occupying Okinawa, and take concrete measures to promote the establishment of a Northeast Asia military alliance in this direction, such as resuming the "Japan-South Korea talks," etc. Soon after taking office, the Ikeda government hurriedly established the Japan-U.S. "Security Consultative Committee" based on the new "Security Treaty," preparing to establish a system in which the U.S. and Japanese forces would fight together under the command of U.S. imperialism. The article pointed out: The Ikeda Cabinet says that the new policy wants to "integrate domestic and foreign affairs," but in reality, its purpose is to attempt to make the Japanese people not resist or express dissatisfaction with its subordination to the United States and its assistance to U.S. imperialism's war policy, but to cooperate.

The article also pointed out: "If a line of subordination and war is adopted in foreign affairs, then in domestic affairs, it is impossible not to suppress the people's rights and destroy the people's lives."

The article pointed out: "The Ikeda Cabinet's 'new policies' were put forward in order to escape the people's condemnation that they are a 'Kishi-style cabinet.' This 'new policy' is a propaganda document that beautifies the people's real enemies, American imperialism and traitorous reactionary forces, and is also a new attack on the Japanese people by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and their loyal agent, the Ikeda Cabinet."

The article finally called on the people to expose the essence of the Ikeda Cabinet's "new policies" and fight to the end to overthrow the Ikeda Cabinet and establish a democratic united government against the "Security Treaty."

    日共中央经济调查部长在“前卫”杂志载文揭露
    池田内阁是第二个岸信介内阁
    文章指出：池田内阁由执政党内的反动集团组成；池田本人是美帝国主义和日本垄断资本的忠实代理人。池田内阁对外屈从美国、敌视中苏、坚持日美军事同盟，对内压制人民权利、破坏人民生活。它的“新政策”是对日本人民的新的进攻。
    据新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本共产党“前卫”杂志在最新一期中刊登题为“池田内阁‘新政策’的实质”的文章，揭露了池田内阁的“新政策”的反动性和欺骗性，指出池田内阁是“第二个岸内阁”，号召日本人民为打倒池田内阁，建立反对“安全条约”的民主联合政府而斗争到底。
    这篇文章的作者是日本共产党中央经济调查部长土岐强。
    文章说：“不论池田内阁怎样宣传‘新政策’，池田首相怎样摆出‘低姿势’，也不能消除人民对池田内阁感到的不安和不信任。”
    文章指出：第一，虽然池田内阁的阁员和岸内阁的阁员多少有些不同，但是池田内阁却是以池田、岸信介、佐藤等自由民主党里面的反动集团组成的，这些反动集团在岸内阁时推行卖国、反动政策。第二，就像池田首相自己夸耀的那样，他在美国方面和日本金融实业界方面有“知己朋友”，他是把日本主权出卖给美国的吉田茂的嫡系人物。不仅如此，在过去，不管是否处于阁员的地位，他都是作为美帝国主义和日本垄断资本集团主流派的最忠实的代理人而行事。第三，池田内阁得到美国和日本的垄断资本集团的超过他们对于岸内阁的全面的支持。
    文章指出：“虽然池田内阁想要装出它不是第二个岸内阁的样子，但是由以上各点来看，也完全可以看出它不仅是第二个岸内阁，而且是比岸内阁更加危险的卖国反动政府。”
    文章接着揭露了池田内阁所谓的“确立议会政治是一切政策的前提”这一口号的目的。文章说：虽然池田内阁和自由民主党嘴里说要保卫议会政治，但是它的目的并不是真要确立议会政治，保卫民主。他们最关心的是，在当前要一面玩弄所谓“民主”、“对反对党忍耐和宽容”这样一些言词，笼络民主社会党和社会党，一面使人民看不到岸内阁摧残议会政治的真正因素，逃避自由民主党的政治责任，并企图恢复自由民主党的政治威信，通过大选，增加自由民主党的议席，进一步把议会变成自由民主党实行独裁的工具。
    文章分析池田内阁的外交政策说：池田内阁的外交政策的基本路线是：第一，重新取得美帝国主义的信任，得到以美国为首的“自由国家”的“尊敬”；第二，采取所谓可以使苏联、中国等社会主义国家“感到害怕”的外交路线；第三，巩固适合于这种路线的国内体制。就是说，要使日本向着屈从美国、复活军国主义和帝国主义的方向前进。文章说：因此，池田内阁的外交政策较之岸内阁的外交政策并没有什么“新”的地方，完全是原封不动地承袭了岸内阁的外交路线。
    文章说，池田政府的外交政策的最大课题是，把坚持日美军事同盟作为外交的基本路线，同美国的占领冲绳的政策实行合作，并按照这个方向采取促进建立东北亚军事同盟的具体措施，例如恢复举行“日韩会谈”等等。池田政府上台后不久急忙根据新“安全条约”成立了日美“安全协商委员会”，准备建立日美两国军队在美帝国主义统率下共同作战的体制。文章指出：池田内阁说什么新政策要使“内政外交一体化”，实际上，它的目的是企图使日本人民对于它从属于美国并且协助美帝国主义的战争政策一事不实行反抗也不表示不满，而实行合作。
    文章并且指出：“在外交方面采取从属和战争的路线，那么，在内政方面，就不能不压制人民的权利，破坏人民的生活。”
    文章指出：“池田内阁的‘新政策’是为了逃避人民说他们是‘岸式内阁’这样一种谴责而提出来的。这个‘新政策’是美化人民真正敌人美帝国主义和卖国反动势力的宣传文件，也是美日反动派和它们的忠实代理人池田内阁对日本人民的新的进攻”。
    文章最后号召人民揭露池田内阁“新政策”的实质，为打倒池田内阁，建立反对“安全条约”的民主联合政府而斗争到底。
