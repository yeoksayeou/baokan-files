    A Gift to the Volunteers of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea
    Deng Tuo
    At the fore in resisting America and aiding Korea,
    Leaving the homeland, sweeping away the smoke of war to the east.
    The cause of peace suffered a violent disaster;
    A righteous war will surely return in triumph.
    Blood sprinkled on the mountains, monuments stand tall;
    Merit soars high, its influence reaching the heavens!
    Let the ice and snow educate for three thousand *li*,
    Lip and teeth bound in firm friendship, steadfast as iron and stone.

    赠抗美援朝诸将士
    邓拓
    抗美援朝一马先，
    国门东去扫狼烟。
    和平事业遭横祸；
    正义战争定凯旋。
    血洒林峦碑在口；
    功高牛斗势垂天！
    任教冰雪三千里，
    唇齿邦交铁石坚。
