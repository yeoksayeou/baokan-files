Tongxian Cart Workers Create New Type of Short-Distance Transportation Tool
Old Boiler Converted into "Trackless Train"
Uses Coal to Burn Steam for Power; Speed of About 10 Kilometers Per Hour; Can Pull 20 Tons of Goods

(Our Newspaper) News from Beijing – After three months of hard work, cart workers from the Tongxian Cart Team in Beijing have created a "trackless train." When traveling on hard-surface roads, this vehicle has a speed of approximately 10 kilometers per hour and can pull 20 tons of goods, equivalent to the transportation capacity of twenty horse-drawn carts. This is a good tool for short-distance transportation.

This "trackless train" was converted from an old boiler. Its shape is similar to a steam train locomotive. It uses coal to boil water into steam for power, consuming about 5 kilograms of coal per kilometer, which can greatly save gasoline and diesel compared to using an internal combustion engine.

Two months of operation have proven that this "trackless train" has many advantages: First, it has great traction and can save labor. It can tow seven trailers, each carrying three tons. Based on each vehicle replacing twenty horse-drawn carts, it can save eighteen cart workers and breeders, and save forty mules and horses.

Second, it is easy to operate and easy to maintain. People with lower levels of education can drive it after only two months of learning.

Third, because six wheels are installed on the boiler, it can be easily driven to where it is needed during busy farming seasons. By installing a belt, it can be used as power for irrigating fields.

The Transportation Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting on the 20th to promote this new type of short-distance transportation tool. (Attached picture)

    通县马车工人创造新型短途运输工具
    旧锅驼机改装成“无轨火车”
    用煤烧蒸汽作动力　时速十公里左右　能拉二十吨货物
    本报讯　北京市通县马车队的马车工人经过三个月的努力，创制成一台“无轨火车”。这种车在硬面公路上行驶时，每小时的速度十公里左右，能拉二十吨货物，等于二十辆马车的运输能力。这是短途运输的一种好工具。
    这台“无轨火车”是用旧锅驼机改装的。它的形状和蒸汽火车头相似。它用煤把水烧成蒸汽作动力，每公里耗煤五公斤左右，比用内燃机带动可以大大节约汽油和柴油。
    两个月的运转情况证明，这种“无轨火车”有许多好处：一、牵引力大，能节省劳动力。它能拖挂七个拖车，每个拖车载重三吨。按照每台车代替二十辆马车计算，可以节约十八名马车工人和饲养员，并可节省四十头骡马。
    二、容易操作，容易保养。文化水平较低的人，只要学习两个月就能驾驶。
    三、由于在锅驼机上安装了六个车轮，农忙时可以很方便地开到需要的地方，装上一条皮带，就能用作动力灌溉田地。
    中共北京市委交通工作部在20日召开现场会议，推广了这种新型的短途运输工具。（附图片）
