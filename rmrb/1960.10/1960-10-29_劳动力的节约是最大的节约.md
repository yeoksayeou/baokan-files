    Labor Saving is the Greatest Saving
    When discussing thrift, people often only pay attention to the saving of materials and neglect the saving of labor. In fact, while the former is very important, the latter is even more important. Saving, whether in production or in life, and in production whether it is in raw materials or in the use of labor, is ultimately the saving of labor. Therefore, when we talk about saving, fundamentally, we must save labor. However, the saving of materials cannot replace the saving of labor. Only by paying attention to the saving of labor can we achieve the most active saving. Only by saving labor can we accelerate socialist construction. Only when people's labor is used most rationally can they create wealth for society as much, as quickly, as well, and as economically as possible. All waste, in the final analysis, is a waste of labor, and among all waste, the waste of labor is the greatest waste. The issue of saving or wasting labor is a very important issue related to the development of socialist construction and related to production and life. This is by no means a trivial matter and should not be taken lightly.
  Our country is vast and has a large population. A large population is a great thing for us. With a large population, we can have a lot of labor to invest in all fronts of socialist construction and accelerate socialist construction. However, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, various undertakings have greatly developed, and our country has changed from a situation of surplus labor in the past to a shortage of labor. Labor shortage is also a good thing. It tells us that our socialist cause is flourishing and developing vigorously, which we should be proud of. It also tells us that, in the final analysis, the amount of labor affects and determines the speed of development of various undertakings. Therefore, in the great development of various undertakings and in the rapid advancement of socialism, the correct arrangement and use of labor is a major issue related to the high-speed and proportionate development of our country's socialist construction.
    The distribution of labor must first be good at distinguishing and handling the relationship between productive and non-productive undertakings. Efforts should be made to reduce the labor force in non-productive undertakings to a minimum. This is especially necessary in our country today, where labor productivity is still not high. Even in non-productive undertakings, there are distinctions between those that are more closely related to production and those that are less closely related. The investment of labor in these undertakings should also vary depending on the degree of production needs. In short, all non-productive undertakings must serve productive undertakings and must not hinder productive undertakings.
    Similarly, within the production sector, there are also distinctions between key and non-key areas. From a national perspective, agriculture is the foundation of national economic development, and industry is the leading factor. Labor should be placed on the key areas as much as possible, and the deployment of forces should not be scattered. Among them, it is especially important to first ensure the grain production front in agriculture. The reason why guaranteeing grain production is particularly important is because the amount of labor a society can allocate to industry, transportation, commerce, cultural, educational and other undertakings ultimately depends on how much marketable grain the labor engaged in agricultural production can provide to society and how much agricultural raw materials it can provide to industry. At present, the level of agricultural mechanization in our country is still low, and agricultural production still mainly relies on human and animal power, so labor productivity is still very low. This situation requires sufficient labor to be invested in the grain production front in agriculture. If we cannot guarantee the primary development of grain production, other undertakings cannot develop. All productive undertakings are very important, but compared with grain production in agriculture, we should first ensure grain production in agriculture. This is especially important when people's communes arrange labor.
    To overcome the waste of labor, we must tap the potential of the existing labor force and improve labor productivity. According to Lenin, labor productivity is the most important and fundamental thing to ensure the victory of the new social system. To improve labor productivity, we must first carry out technological innovation and technological revolution on a large scale, and strive to carry out mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation movements on the industrial and transportation fronts, and gradually realize water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification in agriculture. Secondly, we must organize labor rationally and scientifically, and strive to make the best use of people's talents, avoid idleness and waste, ensure safe production, and ensure that there is work and rest. Finally, we must also correctly handle contradictions among the people, strengthen political and ideological work, and give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the working masses. If each of our units carefully calculates and strives to save labor and improve labor productivity, we can not only guarantee the needs of our own expansion and development, but also free up some labor to strengthen agriculture, develop agricultural production, and create conditions for the great development of the entire national economy. There are many things we can do, there are many loopholes, and there is great potential. Everyone should earnestly and meticulously focus on improving labor productivity and saving labor. Some places are extravagant in the use of labor and mistakenly believe that "more people make things easier." In fact, it is of course good if there are more people if there are really more things to do. However, in places where there are more people than jobs, there are often more problems, more bureaucracy, more loopholes, and lower work efficiency, and things are not done well there. At the same time, if there are fewer people, arranging the work well and trying to give full play to people's strength to do things well is not better? This is called streamlining administration. We advocate such a streamlined policy.

### 劳动力的节约是最大的节约

    劳动力的节约是最大的节约
    在谈到节约的时候，一般人往往只注意物资的节约，而忽视了劳动力的节约。其实，前者固然十分重要，后者则更为重要。节约，无论在生产上或是在生活上，在生产上的节约又不管是原材料方面，或是在劳动力的使用方面，归根到底都是劳动的节约。所以，当我们谈到节约的时候，从根本上说，就是要节约劳动力。但是，物的节约并不能代替劳动力的节约，只有注意劳动力的节约，才是最积极的节约。只有节约劳动力，才有可能加速社会主义建设。只有当人们的劳动力得到最合理使用的时候，才能够尽可能多快好省地为社会创造财富。一切浪费，归根到底都是对于劳动力的浪费，在一切浪费中，对劳动力的浪费是最大的浪费。节约或者浪费劳动力的问题，是一个关系到社会主义建设的发展，关系到生产和生活的极重要的问题。这绝不是一件小事，绝不可以等闲视之。
  我国地大，人多。人多，对于我们是一件大好事。人多，可以有很多的劳动力投入社会主义建设的各个战线，加速社会主义建设。可是，从1958年大跃进以来，各种事业大发展，我国由过去的劳动力有余的情况，一变而为劳动力不足了。劳动力不足，这同样是一件好事。它告诉我们：我们的社会主义事业正在蒸蒸日上蓬勃发展，这是我们应该引以自豪的。它也告诉我们：归根到底，又是劳动力的多少影响和决定着各种事业发展的速度。因此，在各种事业大发展当中，在社会主义飞速前进当中，正确地安排和使用劳动力，是关系到我国社会主义建设事业既高速度又按比例地发展的一个重大问题。
    分配劳动力必须要首先善于区别和处理生产与非生产事业的关系。要力求把非生产事业的劳动力减少至最低限度。我国在今天劳动生产率还不高的情况下，尤其需要这样。就是在非生产事业中，也有和生产的关系较密切和较不密切的区别，在这些事业中投放劳动力，也应该视生产需要的程度有所不同。总之，一切非生产事业必须服务于生产事业，不能妨碍生产事业。
    同样是生产部门，也还有重点与非重点的区别。从全国来看，农业是国民经济发展的基础，工业是主导。劳动力要尽可能放在重点上面，切忌分散兵力。其中，尤其重要的是要首先保证农业的粮食生产战线。保证粮食生产之所以特别重要，是因为，一个社会，究竟能够拿出多少劳动力来从事工业、交通、商业和文教事业等等，归根结底取决于从事农业生产的劳动力能够为社会提供多少商品粮食和为工业提供多少农产品原料。目前，我国农业的机械化水平还低，农业生产还主要靠人力和畜力，因而劳动生产率还是很低的。这样的情况，就需要有足够的劳动力投到农业生产的粮食战线。如果我们不能保证粮食生产的首先发展，其他事业就无法发展。一切生产事业均很重要，但与农业的粮食生产比较起来，还是应该首先保证农业的粮食生产。这在人民公社安排劳动力的时候，尤为重要。
    克服劳动力的浪费，要大挖现有劳动力的潜力，提高劳动生产率。劳动生产率，按照列宁的说法，这是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的东西。提高劳动生产率，首先要大搞技术革新和技术革命，努力在工业和交通运输战线开展机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化运动，逐渐在农业中实现水利化、机械化、电气化。其次要合理地科学地组织劳动，努力作到人尽其才，不窝工，不浪费，安全生产，有劳有逸。最后还要正确处理人民内部矛盾，加强政治思想工作，充分发挥劳动群众的积极性和主动性。如果我们每个单位都精打细算地努力节约劳动力，提高劳动生产率，就可以不仅保证我们本身的扩大发展的需要，而且还可以腾出一些劳动力加强农业，发展农业生产，为整个国民经济的大发展创造条件。我们可以做的事情很多，漏洞也不少，潜力也很大，大家都应该认真细致地大抓提高劳动生产率，大抓节约劳动力。有些地方，在使用劳动力上面大手大脚，错误地认为“人多好办事”。其实，人多如果事情真多，当然好办事。但在人浮于事的地方，往往是问题多、官僚主义多、漏洞多、工作效率低的地方，那里的事情并没有办好。同时如果人少，把工作安排好，尽量发挥人的力量，把事情作好不是更好吗？这就叫精兵简政。我们提倡这样的精兵政策。
