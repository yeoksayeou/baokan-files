    Heroes Shine Eternally
    —A Gathering of Former Volunteer Army Soldiers
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Tong, Xīwén
    Former Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel, now working in various positions in Shenyang City, often gather with deep camaraderie. On the occasion of commemorating "October 25th," I attended one of their gatherings.
    Li Yingxiu, a former staff officer of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, arrived at the meeting, and many people gathered around him to talk cordially. This disabled veteran, who was wounded in more than a dozen places and had one leg amputated in the Korean battlefield, excitedly said when he met everyone: "Today, we are joyfully gathering together, which is truly delightful. We are not only celebrating the anniversary of our War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, but more importantly, it allows us to recall many touching deeds from the Korean battlefield. The bravery, skillful fighting, hard work, and self-sacrificing spirit displayed by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield will always be a tremendous source of inspiration for me, a participant.” He spoke very emotionally about one of his own experiences. He was wounded in a fierce battle, and when the signalman, Li Min, was carrying him to withdraw from the position, they were strafed by enemy aircraft. Li Min used his body to shield him, and as a result, he sacrificed himself. When he was sent to the hospital, due to excessive blood loss, his injuries had seriously deteriorated. A head nurse, in order to rescue him, disregarded her own physical weakness and gave him a blood transfusion. He said, "Whenever I encounter difficulties in work and life, when I think of the fighting spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and these selfless comrades-in-arms, I feel filled with strength."
    Wang Erwa, the squad leader of the late martyr Huang Jiguang, is now a security squad leader in a factory. He said to his old comrades: "I will never forget my close comrade-in-arms Huang Jiguang. I often tell the comrades in the security squad about the heroic act of martyr Huang Jiguang, who stepped forward whenever there was difficulty and sacrificed himself heroically for the overall situation." He was the one who escorted Huang Jiguang’s remains from Korea back to China for burial in Shenyang. After returning home from Korea, he went back to work in his hometown of Inner Mongolia. Later, the organization transferred him to Shenyang, and he obeyed the assignment and left his hometown for the second time. Under the influence of his active work, the squad he led became a model for security personnel throughout the city, and has been continuously praised and rewarded.
    These former Volunteer Army soldiers said that the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea tempered them to be stronger, and they became vanguards who dared to overcome difficulties in their work. Liu Xinshi, a former second-class meritorious veteran of the Volunteer Army who served as a production team leader in the China-Korea Friendship Commune, in the case of insufficient labor during the autumn harvest, transferred the people supporting them to brother brigades. He organized his own team members to work hard day and night, and harvested the crops on time. He said: "The American devils look scary, but as long as you dare to defeat them, they are not scary at all. The difficulties in production are the same; as long as you are determined to overcome them, there is no task that cannot be completed."

    英雄们永放光辉
    ——记前志愿军战士的一次聚会
    新华社记者　佟希文
    在沈阳市各个工作岗位上的前中国人民志愿军人员，经常怀着深厚的战斗友情，欢聚相会。在纪念“十·二五”的日子里，记者参加了他们一次聚会。
    前来参加会的前志愿军某部的参谋李应秀，一落座，许多人就围过来和他亲切地谈起来。这位在朝鲜战场上负伤十多处并截去一只腿的残废军人，和大家一见面就兴奋地说：“今天，我们欢聚一堂，真使人高兴。我们不仅一起欢庆了我们抗美援朝出国作战的节日，更主要的是使我们能够回忆起朝鲜战场上许多可歌可颂的事迹。因为中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上所表现的那种英勇善战，艰苦奋斗，不顾一切的牺牲精神，就是对我这个参加者，也永远是巨大的鼓舞力量。”他非常激动的谈到他自己的一段经历。他在一次激烈的战斗中负了伤，通讯员李敏背着他撤出阵地时，遭到了敌机的扫射，李敏用身体掩护他，结果牺牲了。当他被送到医院时，因流血过多，伤情严重恶化，一位护士长为了抢救他，不顾自己的身体虚弱给他输了血。他说：“我每当在工作和生活中遇到困难，想起中国人民志愿军的战斗精神和这些舍己为人的战友，我就觉得浑身充满了力量。”
    黄继光烈士的生前班长王二娃，现在在一个工厂当警卫班长。他对老战友们说：“我永远忘不了我的亲密战友黄继光，我常把黄继光烈士那种见困难就上，为了大局英勇牺牲的英雄行为讲给警卫班的同志们听。”黄继光烈士的遗体是他从朝鲜护送回国安葬在沈阳的。他从朝鲜归国复员后，便回到家乡内蒙古工作，后来组织上调他到沈阳，他又服从分配第二次离开了家乡。在他积极工作的影响下，他领导的一个班，成为全市警卫工作人员的榜样，不断受到表扬和奖励。
    这些前志愿军战士谈到，抗美援朝斗争把自己锻炼得更加坚强，在工作中成了勇于克服困难的尖兵。在中朝友谊公社担任生产队长的前志愿军二等功臣刘信实，在秋收人力不足的情况下，把支援他们的人拨给兄弟大队，他自己把队员组织起来，昼夜苦干，按时收完了庄稼。他说：“美国鬼子样子可怕，只要你敢于战胜它，它就毫不可怕：生产上的困难也是这样，只要你决心克服它，就没有完不成的任务。”
