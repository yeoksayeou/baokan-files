    Ingeniously Crafting Ten Thousand Hoes
    The Party Committee of the Jieyang Agricultural Machinery Factory in Guangdong Province recently decided that, in order to better support winter planting, the entire factory would launch a "Ten Thousand Hoes Campaign" to produce ten thousand hoes in a concentrated effort.
    The Jieyang Agricultural Machinery Factory has always manufactured machines. When they started producing hoes in early September, they used three small furnaces for manual production, and it was estimated at the time that they could only produce five hundred hoes by the end of September. How could this be acceptable!
    Deputy Director Sun Yuecheng paced back and forth in the workshop. Seeing the gas furnace, air hammer, and large drop hammer, a thought suddenly struck him: "If we use the gas furnace for forging, the large drop hammer and air hammer for hammering, and electric welding to weld the hoe ears, wouldn't we be turning manual operation into mechanized assembly line operation?" He reported this plan to the Party Committee, which immediately transferred more than thirty people to the forging workshop to participate in the "Ten Thousand Hoes Campaign."
    Mechanized production began. On the first day, eighty-two hoes were produced. Two days later, the daily output reached two hundred and nine hoes.
    New problems were encountered in the process of using the new tools: the air hammer could only flatten, but could not create the sharp corners on both sides of the hoe, and it still had to be processed in a small furnace, so the production progress was not fast enough. What to do? After careful observation and research, Sun Yuecheng discovered that the hammer face of the flat hammer was horse-faced, while the hammer face of the air hammer was flat, so of course it could not create sharp corners. Therefore, he quickly designed a horse-faced air hammer face. When the new hammer was installed, more than one hundred and thirty hoes were forged in just over three hours that night, and a process was eliminated. After calculation, the work efficiency was increased by six times compared to the past. (Chen Yongxuan)

    巧造万把锄
    广东揭阳农业机械厂党委不久前决定：为了更好地支援冬种，全厂开展万锄大战，突击生产一万把锄头。
    揭阳农业机械厂一向制造机器，9月上旬开始生产锄头时，三座小炉子用手工生产，当时预计到9月底只能生产五百把。这怎么行呢！
    孙岳成副厂长在车间里踱来踱去。看到煤气炉、空气锤和大吊锤，心里忽然一亮：“如果用煤气炉来锻烧，用大吊锤、空气锤来锻打，再加上用电焊焊接锄头耳，不就把手工操作变成机械化流水作业了吗？”他把这个方案报告给党委，党委立即抽调三十多个人到锻工车间，投入万锄大战。
    机械化生产开始了。第一天，生产了八十二把锄头。两天以后，日产量就达到了二百零九把。
    在使用新工具的过程中碰到了新问题：空气锤只能打薄，不能打出锄头的两边尖角，还要经过小炉加工，生产进度还不够快。怎么办？孙岳成经过仔细观察、研究，发现平锤的锤面是马面形的，而空气锤的锤面却是平面的，当然打不出尖角。于是，他迅速设计了一个马面形的空气锤锤面。当新锤安装起来以后，当晚只用三个多钟头就打出了一百三十多把锄头，而且省掉了一道工序，一计算，工效比过去提高了六倍。　（陈用轩）
