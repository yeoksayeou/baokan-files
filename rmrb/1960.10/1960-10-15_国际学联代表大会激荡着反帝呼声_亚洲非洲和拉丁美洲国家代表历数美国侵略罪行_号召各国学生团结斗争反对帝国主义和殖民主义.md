Xinhua News Agency Report: The Sixth Congress of the International Student Union (ISU) opened in Baghdad on the 8th.

In his address, ISU President Belyakov emphasized that the ISU supports all people struggling against colonialism. It also supports the struggles of people in all countries to dismantle foreign military bases, ban nuclear tests, demand universal disarmament, and end the "Cold War." Belyakov pointed out that young students in all countries face common problems to be solved—opposing imperialism and colonialism, striving for peace, striving for national independence, striving for democratic rights, and improving students' living conditions. He called on students around the world to unite.

Iraqi Prime Minister Qasim addressed the meeting. He welcomed the student representatives from various countries. He said that the people of the world and all nations are united in a joint struggle against imperialism, for freedom and liberation, and to break all chains of enslavement. In his speech, he condemned the imperialist countries' aggression against the Congo and the setting of various obstacles and difficulties to undermine the independence of the Congo. He also stated that the Republic of Iraq will support all nations fighting for independence and will strive to help them.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, October 13th: The Sixth Congress of the International Student Union concluded its plenary session this morning. Over the past four and a half days, starting from the 9th, representatives and observers from student organizations from seventy-one countries and regions spoke at the congress. Representatives and observers from more than forty Asian, African, and Latin American countries condemned the aggression of US imperialism and the colonial rule of imperialism. Representatives from socialist countries expressed their support and sympathy for the students of Asian, African, and Latin American countries in their speeches and introduced the educational development of their own countries.

The congress will begin committee discussions tonight.

ISU President Belyakov, on behalf of the Executive Committee, delivered a report on the experience and development of the international student movement on the 9th. On the 10th, the congress voted to approve Cuba and seven other student groups as members of the ISU.

Imperialist Colonialism is the Root of War
To Safeguard Peace, We Must Struggle and Repel Aggression

At the meeting on the 10th, Angel Quevedo, representative of the Cuban University Students Federation, strongly condemned the US imperialist aggression against Cuba in his speech. He said that the Cuban people will fight for their country, and Cuban students are ready to take up arms at any time when needed. Our slogan is "Rather die than lose our homeland."

He said that we want peace, but the achievement of peace must be based on truth and respect for the right of self-determination of all peoples. We would rather die to be free men than live as slaves.

The Cuban representative pointed out that the United Nations cannot be trusted at all; the United Nations is a tool for US imperialism to carry out the Cold War and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. He said that the United States uses its voting machine to prevent the great People's Republic of China, which has a quarter of the world's population, from entering the United Nations, but fascist Franco's Spain occupies a seat in the United Nations. The United Nations safeguards the interests of imperialism and interferes in the affairs of the Congo.

He emphasized that imperialism and colonialism are the roots of war. They live off the blood and sweat of the colonial people. As long as colonialism exists, there is a threat of war. We must struggle. He finally emphasized that Cuba does not want war. But if the United States invades Cuba, the Cuban people will turn Cuba into a place to bury American aggressors.

The speech of the heroic Cuban student representative repeatedly won warm applause from the congress. When he finished his speech, the members of the presidium shook hands with him warmly.

Imperialism Does Not Respect the People's Right to Self-Determination
Oppressed People Must Rise Up and Drive Out the Oppressors

Ecuadorian student representative Bravo spoke to condemn the US aggression against the people of Latin America and expressed support for the Cuban Revolution. He said that the students of Ecuador, like the people of Latin America, regard the Cuban Revolution as a star illuminating their path. We do not accept the "Declaration of San Jose." We support the Havana Declaration because it reflects the unwavering will of the Cuban people. He said that peaceful coexistence is necessary, and the principle of peaceful coexistence is correct. But imperialism will not accept peaceful coexistence because they do not respect the people's right to self-determination. He said that imperialism is getting weaker and weaker, and the day of their collapse is not far off. The oppressed people will rise up and drive out the oppressors.

Wang Wei, head of the Chinese student delegation, spoke on the evening of the 10th (excerpts will be published separately).

Korean student representative Gao Shangjun, in his speech on the 10th, condemned the aggressive crimes of US imperialism in occupying South Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and violating the independence of the Cuban people, and is still carrying out new acts of aggression against the Congolese people. He said that all this shows that US imperialism is the most vicious enemy of peace and human progress. When talking about the struggle of South Korean students, Gao Shangjun said that South Korean students and people, despite bloody suppression, carried out a heroic struggle and achieved the initial victory of overthrowing the Syngman Rhee puppet regime that US imperialism had fostered for many years. He emphasized that Korean students will continue to struggle to force US imperialism to withdraw from South Korea and realize the peaceful reunification of Korea.

At the meeting on the 9th, Peter, the representative of Puerto Rico, listed twelve crimes of American colonial rule and condemned US imperialism for imposing colonial rule on Puerto Rico since 1898. He emphasized that Puerto Rican students and people unswervingly fight against US imperialism for national independence and firmly believe that they can rely on the support of the International Student Union, the support of national student organizations of China, Mexico, Black Africa, Cuba and the Soviet Union in their anti-imperialist struggle.

The Puerto Rican representative said: Latin Americans today live in a new era because a great revolution has taken place in Cuba. It has frustrated US imperialism on our continent. He said: The Latin American student movement will firmly defend the Cuban revolution led by Castro.

The United Nations Under the Control of US Imperialism
Is a Tool Serving the Interests of Imperialism

Congolese student representative Takizala, in his speech at the conference on the 11th, demanded that the "United Nations forces" withdraw from the Congo. He said: Today the United Nations is a tool serving imperialism under the control of American imperialists.

He said: The so-called "United Nations forces" did not establish so-called "order" in the Congo; on the contrary, it worsened the situation there. The United Nations claims that it will not interfere in the internal affairs of the Congo, but it supports traitors against the legitimate government of the Congo. He said: We cannot trust the United Nations that is carrying out aggression against the Congo and excluding the great China from the United Nations organization.

He also said: The independence of some African countries does not mean that imperialism is dead. The Congo suffered imperialist aggression within a few days after its independence.

The Congolese student representative urged all representatives to expose the true face of imperialism and colonialism to the world. He said: The characteristic of our era is the development of the liberation movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the people are striving to get rid of the imperialist rule of the United States and Western countries. He said: Since the Cuban people can defeat US imperialism, the Congolese people will also stand up and solve their own problems.

If the African People Want to Achieve True Independence
They Must Eradicate Imperialist Forces

Cameroonian student representative Biga pointed out that there can be no peace as long as imperialism and colonialism exist, and called for strengthening the anti-imperialist united front. He condemned French imperialism for forcing Cameroon to join the French Community after its independence.

West African Student Union representative Pat Diagne said: The African people are struggling, and this struggle is closely related to the struggles of the people of Asia, Latin America, and other countries in the world. He emphasized: If the African people want to achieve true independence, they must eradicate imperialism.

He also pointed out: Imperialist countries have always threatened peace and ignored the existence of the People's Republic of China, which has a quarter of the world's population and is advancing by leaps and bounds. He called on Asian and African countries to support the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

US Imperialism Is Challenging the African People
People of All Countries Must Support the Struggle of the African People

East African Student Congress representative Salim Lehios pointed out that US imperialism is challenging the African people. He called on students and people of all countries in the world to support the struggles of the African people.

The Iraqi student representative, in his speech, advocated supporting the Algerian people and Algerian university students who are struggling against French imperialism. He called on the ISU to organize a broad movement to support and help Algerian university students.

Cypriot student representative Peterly strongly demanded the abolition of foreign military bases in Cyprus.

Zhuravleva, head of the Soviet student delegation and secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, spoke about the outstanding achievements of the Soviet people in science, culture, and art, and also talked about the lives and activities of Soviet university students.

In her speech, Zhuravleva condemned colonialism and imperialism. She said that the Soviet Union clearly understands the situation in colonies and underdeveloped countries and is willing to give them selfless fraternal assistance. She also emphasized the significance of the solidarity of the international student movement.

Kim Yen, the student representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in his speech on the 11th, condemned the US imperialists for arming the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet group in South Vietnam and attempting to launch a civil war in Laos, thereby endangering the peace of Indochina. He expressed his determination to peacefully reunify Vietnam and continue to oppose US imperialist aggression.

Two observers from Canadian and British student organizations—which are not members of the International Student Union—and a West German representing the so-called International Union of Liberal Students attempted to disrupt the meeting. On the evening of the 12th, they reiterated the imperialist slanders against the Soviet Union, China, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary and the other socialist countries and defended US imperialism. In addition, two West German "journalists" representing a West German student newspaper that ceased publication two years ago participated in the congress to disrupt it. Their disruption aroused strong indignation from the representatives. Representatives from various socialist countries, Bolivia, Colombia, Panama, Cyprus, Iraq, Palestine, Cameroon, Black Africa, North Africa, and East Africa sternly refuted their slanders and provocations. The Colombian representative pointed out that their slander was no different from Acheson's slander.

Student representatives from Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, Iran, Italy, and many other countries also spoke at the conference.

    帝国主义殖民主义是战争的根源
    维护和平必须进行斗争反击侵略
    在10日的会议上，古巴大学生联合会代表安赫耳·克维多在发言中强烈谴责了美帝国主义对古巴的侵略。他说，古巴人民将为自己的祖国而战，古巴的学生准备好在需要的时候随时拿起武器。我们的口号是“失去祖国，毋宁死”。
    他说，我们要和平，可是和平的取得必须建立在真理和尊重各国人民的自决权的基础之上。我们不愿做奴隶，宁愿为作自由人而死。
    古巴代表指出，对联合国丝毫不能信任，联合国是美帝国主义进行冷战和干涉别国内政的工具。他说，美国使用表决机器阻挠拥有全世界人口四分之一的伟大的中华人民共和国进入联合国，可是法西斯分子佛朗哥的西班牙却在联合国中占有席位。联合国维护帝国主义的利益、干涉刚果的事务。
    他着重指出，帝国主义和殖民主义是战争的根源。他们是靠殖民地人民的血汗过活的。只要殖民主义存在一天，就存在着战争的威胁。我们必须进行斗争。他最后强调指出，古巴不要战争。可是一旦美国侵略古巴，古巴人民将把古巴变成埋葬美国侵略者的地方。
    英勇的古巴学生代表的发言一再博得大会的热烈掌声。当他结束他的发言时，主席团的成员们同他热烈握手。
    帝国主义不尊重人民自决权利
    被压迫人民要起来赶走压迫者
    厄瓜多尔学生代表布拉沃发言谴责美国对拉丁美洲人民的侵略，并表示支持古巴革命。他说，厄瓜多尔的学生像拉丁美洲人民一样，把古巴革命视为照耀他们的道路的明星。我们不接受“圣约瑟宣言”。我们支持哈瓦那宣言，因为它反映了古巴人民不可动摇的意志。他说，和平共处是必要的，和平共处的原则是正确的。可是帝国主义不会接受和平共处，因为他们不尊重人民的自决权利。他说，帝国主义愈来愈削弱，他们垮台之日不远了。被压迫的人民将起来赶走压迫者。
    中国学生代表团团长王伟在10日晚上发言（摘要另发）。
    朝鲜学生代表高尚俊在10日的发言中谴责美帝国主义侵占南朝鲜、台湾、冲绳和侵犯古巴人民的独立的侵略罪行，并且还在对刚果人民进行新的侵略行动。他说，所有这一切表明，美帝国主义是和平和人类进步的最凶恶的敌人。高尚俊在谈到南朝鲜学生的斗争时说，南朝鲜学生和人民不顾血腥镇压，进行英勇的斗争并取得了推翻美帝国主义多年来扶植的李承晚傀儡政权的初步胜利。他强调说，朝鲜学生将继续斗争以迫使美帝国主义撤出南朝鲜，实现朝鲜的和平统一。
    在9日的会议上，波多黎各的代表彼特里列举了美国殖民统治的十二条罪状，谴责美帝国主义自从1898年以来把殖民统治强加于波多黎各。他强调指出，波多黎各学生和人民坚持不渝地为争取民族独立而进行反对美帝国主义的斗争，并且深信在自己的反帝斗争中能够依靠国际学生联合会的支持，依靠中国、墨西哥、黑非洲、古巴和苏联的全国性学生组织的支持。
    这位波多黎各的代表说：拉丁美洲人今天生活在新时代中，因为古巴发生了伟大的革命。它在我们大陆上挫败了美帝国主义。他说：拉丁美洲的学生运动将坚决地保卫卡斯特罗所领导的古巴革命。
    在美帝国主义控制下的联合国
    是为帝国主义利益服务的工具
    刚果学生代表塔基扎拉在11日大会上的讲话中要求“联合国部队”撤离刚果。他说：今天联合国是在美帝国主义者控制之下的为帝国主义服务的工具。
    他说：所谓的“联合国部队”并没有在刚果建立所谓“秩序”，相反地它使那里的局势恶化了。联合国声称它不会干涉刚果的内政，然而它却支持卖国贼，来反对刚果的合法政府。他说：我们不能信任对刚果进行侵略并把伟大的中国排除在联合国组织之外的联合国。
    他又说：某些非洲国家的独立，并不意味着帝国主义已告死亡。刚果独立之后没有几天就遭受到帝国主义的侵略。
    这位刚果学生代表吁请所有代表向世界揭露帝国主义和殖民主义的真面目。他说：我们时代的特征是解放运动在亚非和拉丁美洲的发展，人民竭力争取摆脱美国和西方国家的帝国主义统治。他说：既然古巴人民能挫败美帝国主义，刚果人民也将站起来并解决自己的问题。
    非洲人民要获得真正独立
    就必须根除帝国主义势力
    喀麦隆学生代表毕加指出只要有帝国主义和殖民主义存在就不可能有和平，号召加强反帝统一战线。他谴责法帝国主义在喀麦隆独立后迫使它参加法兰西共同体。
    西非学生总联合会代表帕特·迪亚涅说：非洲人民正在进行斗争，而且这场斗争是同亚洲和拉丁美洲以及世界各国人民的斗争休戚相关的。他强调指出：如果非洲人民要获得真正的独立，他们必须根除帝国主义。
    他还指出：帝国主义国家一贯威胁和平并无视中华人民共和国的存在，而中华人民共和国拥有占全世界四分之一的人口而且正在以飞跃的步伐向前迈进。他要求亚非各国支持恢复中国在联合国的合法席位。
    美帝国主义正对非洲人民挑战
    各国人民要支持非洲人民斗争
    东非学生大会代表萨利姆·雷希奥斯指出美帝国主义正在对非洲人民进行挑战。他要求世界各国的学生和人民支持非洲各国人民的斗争。
    伊拉克学生代表在发言中，主张支持为反对法帝国主义而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民和阿尔及利亚大学生。他呼吁国际学联组织广泛的运动，来支持和帮助阿尔及利亚大学生。
    塞浦路斯学生代表彼得利强烈要求撤销在塞浦路斯的外国军事基地。
    苏联学生代表团团长、苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会书记茹拉夫列娃在发言中谈到了苏联人民在科学、文化和艺术方面取得的杰出成就，还谈到了苏联大学生的生活和活动。
    茹拉夫列娃在发言中谴责了殖民主义和帝国主义，她说，苏联清楚地了解殖民地和不发达国家的情况，并愿意给它们无私的兄弟般的援助。她并且强调指出了国际学生运动的团结一致的意义。
    越南民主共和国的学生代表金炎在11日的发言中谴责美帝国主义者武装南越吴庭艳傀儡集团和企图在老挝发动内战，从而危及印度支那的和平。他表示和平统一越南和继续反对美帝国主义侵略的决心。
    加拿大和英国学生组织——它们不是国际学生联合会的成员——的两名观察员，以及另一名代表所谓国际自由党学生联合会的西德人，企图在会上捣乱。他们在12日晚上重复了帝国主义对苏联、中国、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利和其他社会主义国家的诽谤，并为美帝国主义辩护。此外还有代表两年以前停刊的一家西德学生报纸的两名西德“记者”参加代表大会捣乱。他们的捣乱引起了代表们的强烈愤慨。各社会主义国家，玻利维亚、哥伦比亚、巴拿马、塞浦路斯、伊拉克、巴勒斯坦、喀麦隆、黑非洲、北非和东非的代表严厉地驳斥了他们的诽谤和挑拨。哥伦比亚代表指出，他们的诽谤同赫脱的诽谤没有什么不同。
    在大会上发言的还有罗马尼亚、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、蒙古、伊朗、意大利等许多国家的学生代表。
