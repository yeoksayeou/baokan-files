Transfer More Good Iron Ore and More Good Coal to Support Key Steel Plants
Hebei, Shandong, Benxi Iron and Steel Company, and Zibo Mining Bureau Conscientiously Implement the "National United Front" Policy

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin. Hebei Province conscientiously implements the "National United Front" policy. While actively increasing the production of coking coal, the province uses less coal itself, using inferior coal, saving good coal to support key steel plants across the country. In the first twenty-one days of September, the province transferred 140,000 tons more coking coal than in August, and the quality of the raw coal and refined coal transferred has greatly improved.

In order to increase production and conserve coal to support national steel production, the vast number of workers in Hebei Province expressed their determination to keep the difficulties for themselves and make things easier for others, to produce more coal, produce good coal, and save coal, to ensure the completion of the coal transfer tasks. Coal mine workers throughout the province launched a vigorous overproduction campaign, which led to a continuous increase in coal production. The province's output in mid-September increased by 7.58% compared with the first ten days of the month. Since late September, large coal mines such as Kailuan, Fengfeng, and Jingxing, as well as six local mining bureaus, have been overfulfilling the national plan every day. In order to supply good refined coal to various places, washing plants throughout the province organized excellent coal washing workers and management cadres to form experience dissemination teams, going to Handan and other regions to exchange operating techniques and rapid maintenance experience, to improve the quality of refined coal. The ash content of the refined coal recently transferred from the Matou Washing Plant in Handan and the No. 2 Coal Washing Plant in Fengfeng has been reduced by 0.35% to 0.71% compared with before.

While increasing production, a comprehensive arrangement has also been made for coal used for production and daily life in the province. The province is actively developing local coal "small modern groups" and "small indigenous groups" to supply the needs of coal used in the province. Twenty-one of the twenty-seven pairs of mine shafts that the province focused on renovating this year have completed their tunneling work.

Hebei Province has also launched a mass movement to save coal throughout the province. Metallurgical workers, stoker workers, fire watchers, and cooks in all walks of life have actively remodeled furnaces, kilns, and stoves, improved operating techniques, and adopted various methods such as using pulverized coal instead of lump coal, using inferior coal instead of good coal, using anthracite instead of bituminous coal, and using firewood instead of coal to save coking coal. For example, the coking plant of the No. 1 Mine of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau used to use good coking coal to make coke to supply local needs; now, it has adopted more than ten kinds of inferior coal to make coke, which not only guarantees the supply of coke needed locally but also saves a lot of good coking coal for transfer to support key steel enterprises.

In order to transport the good coking coal and good refined coal produced to key steel plants across the country as quickly as possible, coal mines throughout the province have strengthened cooperation with transportation departments, closely coordinated, and tried every means to accelerate vehicle turnover. Major coal mines have actively increased internal transportation equipment, and have now built forty-four coal storage yards (plants). Many coal mines have achieved "having coal to load even if no production takes place for three days, and being able to produce normally even if no vehicles arrive for three days." The railway department proposes that the coal mines need as many empty cars as they need, and the railway will allocate as many empty cars, ensuring that no car is in arrears and no coal is left on the ground. Railway workers have also launched a multi-pull, fast-running campaign with fast unloading, fast loading, and fast scheduling.

Shandong Provincial, Municipal, and Prefectural Committees Vigorously Grasp Iron Transfer
Xinhua News Agency, Jinan. Shandong Province is promoting the spirit of prioritizing external needs over internal needs, continuously transferring pig iron to support steelmaking production in Shanghai and other places. In the first two ten-day periods of September, the province shipped out more than 74,000 tons of pig iron, a sharp increase of 92% compared with the same period in August.

The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the work of transferring pig iron, placing the transfer task first in the province's pig iron allocation. The relevant responsible cadres of the Provincial Committee and the Industrial Production Committee personally arrange the pig iron transfer plan and conduct regular inspections. The municipal and prefectural committees also promptly study and resolve problems in the transfer of pig iron. The vast number of workers, realizing the importance of supporting steelmaking in key enterprises, fully promote the communist spirit of cooperation, making things easier for others and keeping the difficulties for themselves. In order to transfer more pig iron, the iron-producing units in Jinan City have taken a series of effective measures to steadily improve the production and quality of pig iron. The workers of Jinan Iron Plant also actively support the loading work, transporting the pig iron out in time.

Benxi Iron and Steel Completes its Task of Supporting Shanghai Every Month
Xinhua News Agency, Benxi. Benxi Iron and Steel Company actively transfers high-quality pig iron to support key steel plants in Shanghai and other places. The pig iron transferred to Shanghai has been completing the plan every month since the beginning of this year.

All the workers of Benxi Iron and Steel Company regard the transfer of pig iron to support steelmaking in Shanghai and other places as a glorious task. They actively carry out socialist labor competitions to increase the production of high-quality pig iron. Blast furnace workers implement the operating policy of "wind as the key," implement high-pressure operation, replace large tuyeres, and strengthen hot blast stove operation, which greatly increases the air volume, and the hot blast stove temperature has also increased from the original 800 to 900 degrees to 950 degrees. After taking these measures, the furnace temperature of the blast furnaces throughout the plant has generally risen, and the number of iron tapping and slag tapping is very normal, and the output is increasing day by day. Under the leadership of the Benxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, they have also jointly organized a red flag train for production and transportation with the railway and port bureaus, achieving production and transportation at the same time, and completing the pig iron transfer task quickly and well.

Zibo Mining Bureau Overfulfills Coal Transfer Plan Every Month
Xinhua News Agency, Zibo. The Zibo Mining Bureau tries every means to prioritize the transfer of large quantities of coal to support key steel enterprises. Since the beginning of this year, the bureau has overfulfilled its task of transferring refined coal and coal related to key steel enterprises every month.

According to the characteristics of the Zibo Mining Bureau, such as the large mining area, scattered coal distribution points, and a variety of coal types, the method of having each mine independently manage the plan for the dispatch of coal has been changed to unified management and allocation by the mining bureau. In this way, it is possible to prioritize the transfer of coal to key enterprises in a planned way. For the dispatch work of coal transferred to key units, a daily report system has also been established, with special personnel on duty day and night to organize transfer at any time. On the premise of giving priority to ensuring key needs, the bureau also tries every means to increase the supply of coal to enterprises in the province. (Attached picture)

    多调好铁多调好煤支援重点钢厂
    河北、山东、本溪钢铁公司、淄博矿务局认真贯彻“全国一盘棋”方针
    河北少用煤用次煤多调出好煤
    新华社天津电　河北省认真贯彻“全国一盘棋”方针，在积极增加焦煤生产的同时，自己少用煤，用次煤，节省出好煤支援全国各重点钢铁厂。9月份头二十一天，全省就比8月份多调出十四万吨焦煤，调出的原煤、精煤质量都有很大提高。
    为了增产和节约煤炭支援全国钢铁生产，河北省广大职工表示要把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人，多产煤，产好煤，节约煤，保证煤炭外调任务的完成。全省煤矿职工开展了轰轰烈烈的超产竞赛，使煤炭生产不断上升。全省9月中旬产量比上旬提高7.58％，9月下旬以来，开滦、峰峰、井陉等大煤矿和地方六个矿务局又日日超额完成国家计划。为了供应各地好的精煤，全省各洗选厂组织优秀洗煤工人和管理干部，组成经验传播队，到邯郸等地区交流操作技术、快速检修等经验，提高精煤的质量。邯郸马头洗选厂和峰峰二矿洗煤厂最近外调的精煤，灰分比以前降低了0.35％到0.71％。
    在增产的同时，对本省的生产生活用煤也进行了全面安排。全省积极发展地方煤炭“小洋群”和“小土群”，供应本省用煤的需要。全省今年重点改造的二十七对矿井，已有二十一对完成了井巷工程。
    河北省还在全省范围内开展了群众性的节约煤炭运动。各行各业的冶炼工、司炉工、看火工、炊事员，纷纷动手改造炉、窑、灶，改进操作技术，采取以末煤代块煤、以次煤代好煤、以白煤代烟煤、以柴代煤等多种办法来节约焦煤。如峰峰矿务局一矿炼焦厂，过去是用好焦煤炼焦炭，供应当地需要；现在采取十多种次煤搭配炼焦的办法，既保证供应了本地需要的焦炭，又节约出很多好焦煤外调，支援重点钢铁企业。
    为了把生产出来的好焦煤、好精煤尽快地运到各地重点钢铁厂，全省各煤矿都和运输部门加强协作，紧密配合，千方百计加速车辆周转。各大煤矿积极增加矿内运输设备，目前已修建储煤仓（厂）四十四座，很多煤矿都作到了“三天不生产有煤装，三天不来车能正常生产”。铁路部门提出煤矿需要多少空车，铁路就拨多少空车，保证一车不欠和煤不落地。铁路职工并开展了卸车快、装车快、排车快的多拉快跑运动。
    山东省、市、地委狠抓调铁
    新华社济南电　山东省发扬先外后内精神，源源不断地调运生铁支援上海等地炼钢生产。9月上中两旬，全省外运生铁七万四千多吨，比8月同期猛增92％。
    中共山东省委对外调生铁工作非常重视，把外调任务列于全省生铁分配的第一位。省委和省工业生产委员会有关负责干部都亲自安排生铁外调计划，并且定期检查。各市委、地委也都及时研究解决生铁调运中的问题。广大职工由于认识到支援重点企业炼钢的重要意义，充分发扬了把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己的共产主义协作精神。济南市各产铁单位为了外调更多的生铁，采取了一系列有效措施，使生铁产量、质量都稳步提高。济南铁厂职工们还积极支援装车工作，及时地把生铁装车运出。
    本钢月月完成支援上海任务
    新华社本溪电　本溪钢铁公司积极外调优质生铁，支援上海等地重点钢厂。调往上海的生铁，今年以来都月月完成计划。
    本溪钢铁公司全体职工都把外调生铁支援上海等地炼钢，当作一项光荣的任务。他们积极开展社会主义劳动竞赛，增产优质生铁。高炉职工贯彻以风为纲的操作方针，实行高压操作、更换大风口、加强热风炉操作等各种办法，大大提高了风量，热风炉温也由原来的八、九百度提到九百五十度。采取这些措施后，全厂高炉炉温普遍上升，出铁、出渣次数十分正常，产量逐日增加。他们在中共本溪市委的领导下，还同铁路、港务局等部门联合组织了产、运一条龙红旗列车，做到随产随运，又快又好地完成生铁外调任务。
    淄博矿务局调煤计划月月超额
    新华社淄博电　淄博矿务局千方百计地优先外调大批煤炭，支援重点钢铁企业。今年以来，这个局外调有关重点钢铁企业的精煤和煤炭，月月超额完成任务。
    淄博矿务局根据矿区大、发煤点分散和煤种繁多的特点，将原由各矿自行掌握发运煤炭计划的办法，改为由矿务局统一掌握调运。这样就可以有计划地把煤优先外调给重点企业。对于调往重点单位的煤炭的发运工作，还建立了日报制度，设有专人昼夜值班，随时组织调运。在优先保证重点的前提下，这个局也千方百计地增加对本省企业用煤的供应量。（附图片）
