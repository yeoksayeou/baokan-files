Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 24th - According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities are continuing to launch attacks against the people in various parts of South Vietnam, and recently killed more than 100 former resistance personnel and other patriots. This was revealed in three protest letters recently written by the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army to the International Commission.

One letter cited a Saigon radio broadcast on September 18 stating that the regular army of South Vietnam, in coordination with the "Civil Guard," launched repressive attacks against the people in the provinces of Bac Lieu, Soc Trang, Long Xuyen, Chau Doc, Sa Dec, Rach Gia, Ha Tien, Vinh Long, Tay Ninh, Ninh Thuan, and others. The radio station revealed that in the first ten days of September alone, 98 people were killed, 19 were arrested, and many others were injured.

The Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army said that in August and September, attacks were also carried out against the people in Ben Tre Province, south of Saigon, with the participation of more than one battalion of the "Civil Guard." According to incomplete statistics, hundreds of former resistance personnel and others were subjected to severe torture, many of whom were killed, their houses burned or destroyed, and their property plundered.

The Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army requested the International Commission to immediately take active measures to stop these attacks and demanded that the South Vietnamese authorities release the detained people and compensate the families of the victims.

In a letter dated October 7, the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army reiterated its request that the International Commission immediately investigate the attacks launched by the South Vietnamese authorities in the former resistance areas and notify the delegation of the investigation results.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi - According to news from South Vietnam, five hundred young people who were recently forcibly concentrated by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique into a military training camp in Tien Phuoc District, Quang Nam Province, angrily left the training camp and returned home, despite the suppression by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

It is reported that in order to further control and force young people to act as their pawns, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is stepping up its efforts in Quang Nam Province and other parts of South Vietnam to force young people to join the so-called "Republican Youth League." This organization is actually a semi-armed organization, and young people forced to join this league must receive military training.

The young people in the Tien Phuoc District military training camp, unable to endure the painful life and the unreasonable behavior of the instructors, had firmly demanded to go home, and finally they left the training camp despite the threats and persecution of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

The Hanoi "People's Daily" published a commentary on this incident, pointing out that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's conspiracy to force young people to participate in military training is an attempt to rely on the strength of young people to realize their policies of harming the country and the people, to supplement their regular forces and "security regiments," and to drive young people to participate in the criminal activities of "sweeping" and destroying people's property.

The commentary pointed out that the youth of South Vietnam are extremely indignant at the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's vicious conspiracy, and they are closely united, fighting against the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's military training system and reactionary youth organizations.

    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团致函国际委员会
    抗议越南南方当局迫害前抗战人员
    新华社河内24日电　据越南通讯社报道，吴庭艳当局在越南南方各地继续向人民发动袭击，最近杀害了一百多名前抗战人员和其他爱国者。这是越南人民军总司令部联络代表团最近在写给国际委员会的三封抗议信中揭露的。
    有一封信援引西贡电台9月18日的消息说，越南南方的正规军在“民卫队”的配合下，在薄寮、朔庄、龙川、朱笃、沙沥、迪石、河仙、永隆、西宁、宁顺和其他省份中向人民发动了镇压性的袭击。这家电台透露，单在9月份的头十天中，就有九十八人被杀害，十九人被逮捕，另外许多人受伤。
    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团说，8、9两月在西贡以南的槟椥省也对人民进行了袭击，有一营以上的“民卫队”参加。据不完全统计，数以百计的前抗战人员和其他人受到了严刑拷打，其中许多人被杀害，他们的房屋被烧毁或被破坏，财产被掠夺。
    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团要求国际委员会立即采取积极的措施来停止这种袭击，并要求越南南方当局释放被拘留的人民并给受害者的家属以赔偿。
    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团在10月7日的信中重新要求国际委员会立即对越南南方当局在前抗战区发动的袭击进行调查，并把调查结果通知代表团。
    据新华社河内电　据来自越南南方消息报道，最近被吴庭艳集团强迫集中到广南省先福县军事训练营的五百名青年，不顾吴庭艳集团的镇压，愤怒地离开训练营回家了。
    据报道，吴庭艳集团为了进一步控制和强迫青年充当他们的走卒，正在广南省和越南南方各地加紧逼使青年加入所谓“共和青年团”。这个组织实际上是一个半武装性质的组织，被迫加入这个团的青年必须接受军事训练。
    先福县军事训练营的青年，由于无法忍受痛苦的生活和教官的蛮横无理的行为，曾经坚决要求回家，最后他们终于不顾吴庭艳集团的威吓、迫害而离开了训练营。
    河内“人民报”就此事件发表评论指出，吴庭艳集团强迫青年参加军事训练的阴谋，是企图依靠青年力量来实现他们的祸国殃民政策，以补充他们的正规部队和“保安团”，并驱使青年参加“扫荡”和破坏人民的财产的罪恶活动。
    评论指出，越南南方青年对吴庭艳集团的毒辣阴谋感到无比愤慨，他们正在紧密团结，进行斗争，反对吴庭艳集团的军事训练制度和反动的青年组织。
