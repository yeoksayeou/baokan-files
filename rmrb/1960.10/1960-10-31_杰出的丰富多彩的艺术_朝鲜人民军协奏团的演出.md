Outstanding and Colorful Art
    ——Performance by the Concert Troupe of the Korean People's Army
    Shi Lemeng Text A Lao Sketch

    We watched the performance of the Concert Troupe of the Korean People's Army in a warm and joyful friendly atmosphere with great excitement. This was a very outstanding and very successful performance.

    The Concert Troupe of the Korean People's Army was born in the revolutionary struggle and grew strong in the battles and training under the care of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung. They advanced rapidly in the posture of the Chollima (a mythical winged horse), improved their professional skills, mastered artistic techniques, and quickly transformed this literary and artistic team organized by soldiers into an artistic group with high political and artistic accomplishment, becoming a powerful assistant to the Korean Workers' Party in educating revolutionary soldiers in the army. Their contributions to the revolutionary cause and their artistic achievements have not only been welcomed and loved by the military and civilians at home but have also been warmly welcomed by the people of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as progressive youth from all over the world.

    Their programs have profound and distinct political content and moving internationalist spirit, with strong military characteristics and national style. For example, the chorus pieces "Wind and Snow," "Volunteer Army March," "Towards the Decisive Battle," "The Cookhouse Vehicle Is Racing," "Old Woman and Soldier," and the dances "Comrades-in-Arms," "Orchard Harvest," "Warriors in the Dense Forest," "Missing the Motherland," "Meeting on the High Ground," and many other programs, all reflect the love of the Korean people and army for their motherland, their hatred of the American imperialist aggressors, the revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism of the Korean People's Army, the great victory against aggression and the brilliant achievements in building the motherland, and the proletarian internationalist spirit and the touching combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean military and civilians.

    Their performance was not only rich and colorful but also demonstrated a high level of artistic achievement. The chorus not only has perfect and comprehensive technical training but also rich artistic imagination, all of which is fully reflected in the male chorus, such as "Towards the Decisive Battle," where the lyrical high-pitched counterpoint blends cleverly with the middle and low-pitched rhythms; "The Cookhouse Vehicle Is Racing" uses lively and humorous rhythms to express vivid life images. The diminuendo falsetto ending of this piece and the extremely weak falsetto start to the extremely strong treatment of "Wind and Snow" were both extremely perfect and successful. Their chorus not only skillfully mastered the general traditional methods of Western Europe but also successfully combined them with national traditional vocal methods and styles, developing the tradition. For example, the mixed chorus "Ballad of Eagle Peak," "Dragon River Gold Ah Ri," especially "Resting on the Construction Site," not only fully demonstrated the chorus's talent from an artistic expression point of view but also the composer's talent. The jumping rhythms and joyful emotions embodied in this piece seem to make the audience see the life scenes and heroic figures in the "Chollima Movement."

    The orchestra's bright timbre, unified and meticulous artistic techniques, and embellishment of the chorus and dance performances added to their brilliance, completing a full artistic creation excellently.

    The new techniques and rich texture of the national orchestra did not destroy the tradition at all, but creatively enriched and developed it, leaving people with extremely deep memories. This point reached its peak in the dance "Phoenix Fan Dance." The harmonious consistency of music, dance, and scenery in this program, with the temperament of a colorful lyrical poem, left people with an extremely deep impression.

    Other programs, such as the dances "Joy" and "The Day of Distribution," and singing such as Gayageum singing, baritone solo, soprano solo, male small chorus, female small chorus, etc., were also warmly welcomed by the audience due to the high artistic talents of the writers and actors.

    Watching their performance was not only an extremely satisfying artistic enjoyment but also a very good learning experience.

    I wish the Concert Troupe of the Korean People's Army greater success in their performances in our country!
    May the friendship between the people of China and Korea be forever consolidated and developed! (Attached pictures)
    "Joy"
    "The Day of Distribution"

    杰出的丰富多彩的艺术
    ——朝鲜人民军协奏团的演出
    时乐蒙　文  阿老速写
    我们在热烈欢腾的友好气氛中，怀着十分激动的心情观看了朝鲜人民军协奏团的演出。这是一次非常出色、非常成功的演出。
    朝鲜人民军协奏团是在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅的关怀下，在革命的斗争中诞生，在战斗的锻炼中成长壮大的。他们以千里马的姿态飞快前进，提高业务水平，掌握艺术技巧，很快地使这一支由士兵组织起来的文艺队伍，一变而成为具有高度政治素养和艺术修养的艺术团体，成为朝鲜劳动党在部队中对革命战士进行教育的有力助手。他们对革命事业的贡献和艺术成就不仅受到国内军民的欢迎和热爱，也受到了苏联和各社会主义国家的人民及世界各国进步青年的热烈欢迎。
    他们的节目有着深刻鲜明的政治内容和动人的国际主义精神，有着强烈的部队特点和民族风格。如合唱《风雪》、《志愿军战歌》、《走向决战场》、《炊事车在奔驰》、《老大娘和战士》，舞蹈《战友》、《果园丰收》、《密林中的勇士》、《怀念祖国》、《高地相逢》等许多节目，都反映了朝鲜军民对祖国的热爱，对美帝国主义侵略者的憎恨，反映了朝鲜人民军的革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义精神，反映了反侵略的伟大胜利和建设祖国的光辉成就，反映了无产阶级的国际主义精神和中朝军民之间可歌可泣的战斗友谊。
    他们的演出不但丰富多彩，而且表现出了高度的艺术造诣。合唱队不仅具有完美全面的技巧训练，而且有着丰富的艺术想像，这些都充分地表现在男声合唱中，如《走向决战场》，抒情的高音衬腔与中、低音的节奏巧妙地融合在一起：《炊事车在奔驰》，通过活泼有风趣的节奏表现出了生动的生活形象。此曲渐弱的假声结束与《风雪》的从极弱的假声开始到极强的处理都表现得极为完美成功。他们的合唱不仅熟练地掌握了一般西欧的传统方法，而且更将其与民族传统的声乐方法、风格成功地结合了起来，发展了传统。如混声合唱《鹰峰山谣》《龙江金啊里》，尤其是《工地上的休息》，不仅从艺术表现上充分显示了合唱队的才能，而且也表现了作曲家的才能。此曲所体现出来的跳荡的节奏，欢乐情绪，好像使听众看到了“千里马运动”中的生活情景和英雄人物。
    管弦乐队明朗的音色，统一细致的艺术手法，对合唱、舞蹈的表演更如锦上添花，极出色地完成了完整的艺术创造。
    民族乐队的新的手法，丰富的织体，都丝毫没有破坏传统，而是创造性地丰富、发展了传统，给人们留下极深刻的记忆，这点在舞蹈《凤扇舞》中达到了高峰。这个节目音乐、舞蹈、布景的协和一致性，以有声有色的抒情诗的气质给人们留下了极为深刻的印象。
    其它如舞蹈《欢喜》、《分配的日子》，歌唱如伽倻琴弹唱、男中音独唱、女高音独唱、男声小合唱、女声小合唱等节目，也都由于作家与演员的高度艺术才能而得到了观众极热烈的欢迎。
    看了他们的演出，不仅是一次极为满足的艺术享受，而且更是一次很好的学习。
    祝朝鲜人民军协奏团在我国的演出获得更大的成就！
    祝中朝两国人民的友谊永远巩固发展！（附图片）
