　　Grasp Maintenance
　　"A craftsman who wishes to do his job well must first sharpen his tools." If farmers want to grow good crops, they must maintain their farm tools well. This is a very simple principle.

　　What are the signs of well-maintained farm tools? The signs are few damages, long lifespan, high utilization rate... To achieve these, the first thing is to do a good job of regular maintenance and storage. The Gaojiadian Commune in Xifeng County has a good set of methods in this regard, and as a result, they have basically achieved the above requirements. They also have another gain: by maintaining and storing farm tools well at ordinary times, they save the manpower for concentrated repair and manufacture of farm tools before the busy season, and thus can free up hands to improve farm tools even more.

　　To maintain farm tools well, the support of the industrial sector is naturally needed. Like the Guangdong mechanical industry department, which arranged forces early to rush to manufacture parts, and like the workers in Xiangyang, who sent farm tools, parts, technology, and repair work to the doorstep, all embody the proactive spirit of supporting farm tool maintenance work.

　　The key to doing a good job in farm tool maintenance lies in having a correct understanding. Rural communes should not one-sidedly emphasize use and neglect maintenance, and industrial departments should not one-sidedly emphasize manufacturing and neglect repair and parts supply. If everyone uses the same energy to grasp maintenance as they do to grasp use, grasp reform, and grasp manufacturing, farm tools will be better maintained. If everyone acts in this spirit, autumn planting, winter plowing, and next year's spring plowing production will have more handy tools!

    抓维修
    “工欲善其事，必先利其器”。农民要种好庄稼，就要把农具维修好。这是个很简单的道理。
    维修好农具的标志是什么？标志是损坏少，寿命长，利用率高……。要做到这几点，首先要做好经常的维修保管工作。西丰县郜家店公社在这方面有一套好办法，结果就基本上达到了上述要求。他们还有一个收获：平时把农具维修保管好了，便节省了农忙前集中赶修、赶制农具的人力，因而能腾出手来去更多地改良农具。
    要维修好农具，自然需要工业部门的支援。像广东机械工业部门那样早早安排力量赶制配件，像襄阳的工人们那样把农具、配件、技术和修理工作送上门去，都体现了支援农具维修工作的主动精神。
    搞好农具维修工作的关键，在于有正确的认识。农村公社不片面地重使用轻维修，工业部门不片面地重制造轻修配，大家都用抓使用、抓改革、抓制造一样的劲头来抓维修，农具就会维修得更好。大家都照这样的精神办事，秋种、冬耕以及明年春耕生产就会有更多的得心应手的利器！
