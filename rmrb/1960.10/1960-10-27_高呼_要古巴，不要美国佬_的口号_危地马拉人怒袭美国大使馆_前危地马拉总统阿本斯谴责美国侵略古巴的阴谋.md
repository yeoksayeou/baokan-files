Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch from San Salvador: According to a report in the Salvadoran newspaper El Diario de Hoy on the 22nd, one hundred Guatemalans recently held a demonstration in front of the US Embassy in Guatemala, shouting slogans of "Cuba yes, Yankees no!" and smashing the windows of the US Embassy with stones.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 21st dispatch: Former Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz last night addressed a mass meeting in Havana commemorating the 16th anniversary of the October 20th Guatemalan Democratic Revolution, calling on the people of Latin America to unite and support the Declaration of Havana.

Arbenz was the president of the democratic government of Guatemala from 1951 to 1954, his government having been overthrown by US armed intervention. October 20th is the anniversary of the armed uprising of the Guatemalan people to overthrow the puppet government of the so-called interim president Ponce, who was fostered by US imperialism.

In his speech, Arbenz condemned the current Guatemalan government for carrying out the orders of the US government and turning Guatemala into a base for attacking Cuba. He went on to say that the Guatemalan people condemn the US imperialist anti-Cuban criminal plans and are fighting to defeat these plans.

Cuban newspapers reported today that yesterday the people of the Guatemalan capital held a demonstration commemorating the October 20th Democratic Revolution, with demonstrators shouting slogans of "Cuba yes, Yankees no!" Angered by the US aggression against Cuba, the demonstrators attacked the US Embassy with stones, and condemned the despicable behavior of the Ydígoras government in colluding with the United States in the aforementioned aggression.
