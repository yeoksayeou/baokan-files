    Opinions from Various Countries Praise the Chinese People's Struggle and Achievements
    Kenyan Trade Union Leader Talks About Impressions of Visiting China
    The Chinese People Deeply Trust Chairman Mao and the Communist Party
    He said that after visiting China, he understood why imperialists prohibited people from African colonial countries from visiting China because China's tremendous achievements of high-speed development shocked the imperialists; imperialist propaganda says that there is no benefit in interacting with socialist countries, but I have seen that there are many things in China worth learning from.
    Before leaving Beijing, Ochwada, General Secretary of the Kenyan Federation of Labor and General Secretary of the East African Building Workers' Union, gave an interview to a Xinhua News Agency reporter, enthusiastically praising the tremendous achievements made by the Chinese people in the eleven years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. He said that after visiting China, he now understands why the imperialists prohibit people from African colonial countries from visiting China, because China's tremendous achievements of high-speed development are shocking the imperialists, and this is what the imperialists do not like. Ochwada said that imperialist propaganda says that there is no benefit for us in interacting with the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries, but during his visit to China, he saw that there are many things in China worth learning from because we are eager to get rid of poverty, ignorance, and disease. He said that for the benefit of the Kenyan people, Kenya will also take the socialist road after its independence in the future. He also said that the most impressive thing during his visit to China was the tremendous economic development since China's liberation, the Chinese people's determination to change their economic status, and their hard-working spirit. The Chinese people deeply trust their Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party.
    Ochwada said that the Chinese people will reach the level of highly developed Western countries in the next ten years.
    He also praised China's urban and rural people's communes. He said, "I think China's people's communes have taken a big step forward in improving production, increasing people's income, and improving their well-being. I am amazed at the great achievements made by housewives in the factories of the people's communes. I have noticed that these factories with simple equipment can manufacture precision instruments used in scientific research and electrical machinery. In the rural people's communes, I had conversations with the commune members, and they, both men and women, young and old, expressed their determination to work hard to develop the country's economy." He also talked about the great role played by Chinese trade unions in developing the national economy, improving people's lives, and technical education. Ochwada also pointed out that he has visited many countries, and in contrast to the imperialist countries full of police on the streets, China has very few police, and the people are enthusiastically engaged in construction work. This is the best answer to the imperialists' propaganda about China being belligerent and a so-called police state. Ochwada also expressed the hope that Kenya and China will establish closer relations in the shortest possible time. He said: "The friendship between the Kenyan people and the Chinese people is eternal."

    各国舆论盛赞中国人民的斗争和成就
    怯尼亚工会大会总书记谈访华观感
    中国人民深深信任毛主席和共产党
    他说，访问中国后才明白为什么帝国主义禁止非洲殖民地国家人民访华，因为中国高速度发展的巨大成就震动了帝国主义；帝国主义宣传说，同社会主义国家来往没有好处，但是我看到中国有不少东西值得我们学习
    怯尼亚工会大会总书记兼东非建筑工会总书记奥奇瓦达在离开北京前向新华社记者发表谈话，热情地赞扬了中国人民建国十一年来所取得的巨大成就。他说，来中国访问后，我现在才明白为什么帝国主义者禁止非洲殖民地国家的人民来访问中国。因为中国高速度发展的巨大成就震动着帝国主义，而这是帝国主义者所不喜欢的。奥奇瓦达说，帝国主义宣传说，同中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家来往对我们没有好处，但在访问中国期间，我看到中国有不少东西值得我们学习，因为我们渴望摆脱贫困、无知和疾病。他说，为了怯尼亚人民的利益，将来独立以后的怯尼亚也将采取社会主义的路线。他还说，在访问中国期间给他印象最深的是中国解放以来在经济方面的巨大发展，中国人民为改变他们的经济地位所表现的决心和他们努力进行工作的干劲。中国人民深深地信任他们的毛主席和中国共产党。
    奥奇瓦达说，中国人民在今后十年内将达到高度发展的西方国家的水平。
    他还对中国的城乡人民公社表示赞扬。他说，我认为中国的人民公社对提高生产、提高人民的收入和生活福利方面前进了一大步。我对家庭妇女在人民公社的工厂作出那么大的成绩感到惊奇。我注意到这些设备简单的工厂能够制造科学研究和电机上应用的精密器械。在农村人民公社，我曾同社员们进行了谈话，他们不论男女老少都表示决心要努力发展国家的经济。他还谈到了中国的工会对发展国家经济、改善人民生活和技术教育方面所起的巨大作用。奥奇瓦达还指出，他曾访问过许多国家，同满街都是警察的帝国主义国家对比起来，中国只有很少的警察，而且人民都热情地从事建设工作。这是对帝国主义者宣传中国好战和所谓警察国家的最好的回答。奥奇瓦达还表示希望在最短期间内，怯中两国将建立起更亲密的关系。他说：怯尼亚人民和中国人民之间的友谊是永恒的。
