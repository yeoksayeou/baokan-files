    Since the beginning of this year, Beijing and Shanghai have organized 1.24 million middle and primary school students to participate in extracurricular science and technology activities, and have achieved very exciting results. Through science and technology activities, students are helped to better master and apply the knowledge they have learned in class, consolidate and deepen their understanding of what they have learned, and improve the quality of their learning; moreover, students have also learned a lot of knowledge that they cannot learn in class, expanded their knowledge fields, and given full play to their intelligence and creativity; more importantly, through this kind of activity, very vivid and practical communist education has been carried out, cultivating the labor viewpoint of young people, improving their ideological and moral character, enabling them to establish a communist style of daring to think and act from an early age, and the lofty ambition to dare to climb the peak of science, and cultivate a dialectical materialist worldview. Facts have proved that carrying out science and technology activities for young people and children in middle and primary schools is one of the important ways to carry out communist education for young people, and to cultivate a reserve force of both red and expert scientific and technical personnel in a faster, better, and more economical way. It is an important task with strategic significance.
    Our country is facing the great and arduous task of building socialism, to build our country to a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and modern science and culture, and march toward the far-reaching goal of communism, there must be a strong scientific and technological force. This requires us to strengthen the education of young people and children in many ways, cultivate their love and interest in science and technology from an early age, and guide them to engage in creative scientific and technological activities. As everyone knows, many famous scientists in the world who have broken with conventions and discovered new laws in science were science enthusiasts since childhood. Zu Chongzhi, a great scientist in ancient China, studied mathematics diligently in his youth and made many great inventions. The Soviet biologist Michurin was cultivated by his family's interest in horticulture and fruit tree planting from his childhood. Young people and children are very malleable, and the youth is also the period when the desire for knowledge is the strongest. Our educators, scientists, league and team workers and parents should consciously support, help and guide the scientific and technological activities of young people and children. Our country's future great scientists, great inventors, and technical innovators are all nurtured in today's children. As long as we start from now on and guide them properly, their future achievements will surely far exceed their predecessors. Most of our older generation of scientists spent their lives in difficult times. In that dark society, I don't know how many young talents were stifled and buried. However, today's situation is completely different. Under the socialist system, under the care and cultivation of the Party, children can receive the best education, and their intelligence can be developed to the greatest extent. The great leap forward in socialist construction and the great development of the technical revolution movement, countless technical innovations and creations that emerge every day, encourage children to engage in scientific and technological research and experiments; the grand prospect of communism and the beautiful ideal of conquering the universe attract them to study science diligently and explore the mysteries of the universe. Especially after the party's policy of combining education with productive labor has been thoroughly implemented, students encounter a large number of practical scientific and technical problems in the practice of productive labor, which also often prompts them to further explore. He Zongchuan, a student of Shanghai No. 51 Middle School, was inspired by his work in an electrical machinery factory, and worked hard to study Kirchhoff's theorem and the superposition equation in university courses, and made a Wheatstone bridge needed for production. This fact vividly illustrates that we must fully estimate the strong desire for knowledge and abundant creative ability of today's young people, and in addition to strengthening classroom teaching for them, we must actively carry out extracurricular science and technology activities to meet their requirements in many ways, guide them to study science and technology, and establish from an early age the lofty ambition of "overcoming the earth, building a strong country, and climbing the peak of science" and the fine qualities of loving labor and not fearing hardship. The facts in Beijing and Shanghai fully prove that as long as our leadership is good and the arrangements are appropriate, we can give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the children, and there is much to be done in the scientific and technological activities of young people.
    At present, science and technology activities for young people and children have been launched not only in Beijing and Shanghai, but also in many parts of the country. However, the development is still very uneven, the activities are not widespread and in-depth enough, and they are far from keeping up with the needs of the development of the situation. In the future, as long as the party committees, the Communist Youth League, the Science and Technology Association and other relevant units at all levels attach importance to this work, strengthen leadership, make the scientific and technological activities closely combined with teaching and productive labor, and let go of mobilizing the masses, any region, whether urban or rural, can carry out the scientific and technological activities of young people and children vigorously and vibrantly.
    According to the experience of Beijing and Shanghai, to carry out the science and technology activities of young people and children well, we must first resolutely implement the party's education policy. Education serves proletarian politics. In the activities, guide young students to care about politics, care about the country's construction cause, and realize that carrying out scientific and technological activities is for the purpose of serving the motherland better in the future, so that when they carry out scientific and technological activities, they are not only based on personal interests, but also full of political enthusiasm. The combination of education and productive labor makes the scientific and technological activities of young people combined with teaching and productive labor, which can both use their brains and hands, combine theory with practice, expand knowledge and exercise their thinking in the activities. At present, many regions are carrying out agricultural science and technology research, popularization of craft technology and radio and other activities. Through running small farms, hundred flower gardens, weather sentry posts, small factories and various experimental production activities, students can obtain richer knowledge of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, etc., improve their thinking, and also make important research results and works, which greatly improves the quality of teaching.
    Secondly, to carry out science and technology activities for young people and children, we must also follow the mass line and launch a mass movement. Science and technology activities for young people and children must never be just activities for a few "genius" students, but should be activities for the majority of students; we cannot rely on only a few people to organize, but should widely mobilize all forces to care about and support. The organization of counseling forces should also rely on the masses. In addition to teachers, the vast number of workers, peasants, scientific and technical personnel, and parents of students are all counselors. Activists among students can also be used as "little teachers", and those who are capable can be teachers, and pass on knowledge at all levels. It is difficult for the scientific and technical knowledge of teachers and counselors to meet the requirements of youth activities, and training classes and other methods should be adopted to train and improve them. The Science and Technology Association in various regions should unreservedly undertake this work and play an active role. In the early stage of the activity, we must focus on ideological mobilization, talk about the strategic significance of carrying out science and technology activities for young people and children, and overcome various conservative ideas. At the same time, seize typical cases, set up pacesetters, create momentum, and promote the comprehensive development of the movement. The methods of activities should be adapted to local conditions and diversified, combining field activities (such as children's palaces, children's homes, etc.) with small-scale decentralized activities, with small-scale activities as the main focus, from primary to advanced, from general to cutting-edge, using indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and gradually improving, so as to be suitable for the majority of young people to participate. Cultural centers, libraries, clubs, and public canteens can all be used as places for young people to carry out activities. The equipment and conditions for carrying out activities should mainly rely on the masses to solve problems through self-reliance, advocate spending less money and doing more things, and doing things without spending money, "relying on the mountains in the mountains and relying on the water in the water". The electrician group of Shanghai Jurong Road Primary School used a hammer and a pair of pliers, and used bottles and cans to make more than 550 scientific and technological works; some schools in Beijing used cardboard boxes to make earphones, and used waste wax paper to wind iron wire instead of enameled wire, and also made crystal radios. This spirit of diligence and frugality in carrying out scientific and technological activities is worth learning.
    In carrying out science and technology activities for young people and children, we should also proceed according to the characteristics of young people and children. The content of the activities should be able to improve thinking, increase knowledge, and be beneficial to the physical and mental health of young people and children; the activities should also pay attention to being lively and not mechanically copying the practices of adults; the arrangement of the amount of activities should take into account political study, classroom homework, cultural and sports activities, and rest and sleep time, and should not be too tense, which will affect the academic performance and health of young people and children and hinder comprehensive development.
    The task of carrying out science and technology activities for young people and children in a comprehensive, extensive, and in-depth manner must be completed under the leadership of the Party by organizing the forces of all parties. The education department should take this work as a part of its own education work, put it on the agenda, organize and arrange it in a unified manner, and organize teachers to actively carry out this activity; the Communist Youth League should become the most active assistant of the Party in carrying out science and technology activities for young people and children, and through the league and team organizations, mobilize and organize the vast number of young people and children, give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity, and make the activities rich and colorful; the Science and Technology Association should actively mobilize and organize scientific and technological forces, and strengthen scientific and technological guidance. Educators, science and technology workers, worker-peasant innovators, cultural and art workers, and parents of students should all care about and support this activity. Various youth newspapers and periodicals and science and technology popularization newspapers, publishing houses, libraries, radio stations (stations), television stations, and film studios should all write and provide more and better articles, reading materials, radio programs, and science education films suitable for young people and children. We are deeply convinced that under the leadership of party committees at all levels, by fully mobilizing the masses, everyone cares, and everyone takes action, the scientific and technological activities of young people and children will surely be carried out rapidly and vigorously.

    广泛开展青、少年科学技术活动
    今年以来，北京和上海组织全市中、小学生一百二十四万人参加课余科学技术活动，已经取得了十分令人兴奋的成绩。通过科学技术活动，帮助学生更好地掌握和运用课堂上学到的知识，使学到的东西得到巩固和加深理解，提高了学习质量；而且还使学生学到了许多课堂上学不到的知识，扩大了知识领域，发挥了他们的聪明才智和创造能力；更重要的则是通过这种活动，进行了很生动很实际的共产主义教育，培养了青少年们的劳动观点，提高了他们的思想品德，使他们从小就树立起敢想敢干的共产主义风格和敢于攀登科学高峰的雄心大志，培养辩证唯物主义的世界观。事实证明，开展中、小学青、少年的科学技术活动是对青、少年进行共产主义教育，多、快、好、省地培养又红又专的科学技术后备力量的重要途径之一，是一项带有战略意义的重要任务。
    我们的国家正面临着伟大而艰巨的建设社会主义的任务。为了把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，并向共产主义的远大目标迈进，就必须有一支强大的科学技术队伍。这就需要我们从多方面加强对青、少年的教育，从小就培养他们对科学技术的爱好和兴趣，引导他们从事创造性的科学技术活动。大家知道，世界上许多在科学上打破陈规、发现新规律的著名科学家都从小就是科学的爱好者。中国古代伟大的科学家祖冲之在年青时候就刻苦钻研数学，作出了许多伟大的发明创造。苏联生物学家米丘林，从幼年开始，家庭就培养了他对于园艺和种植果树的兴趣。青、少年的可塑性很大，青、少年时代也是求知欲最旺盛的时期，我们的教育工作者、科学工作者、团、队工作人员和家长们应当有意识地支持、帮助和指导青、少年的科学技术活动。我国将来的大科学家、大发明家、技术革新家，都孕育在今天的少年儿童中，只要我们从现在开始，引导得法，他们将来的成就一定会远远地超过前辈。我们老一辈的科学家大多数是在坎坷的岁月中度过的。在那黑暗的社会里不知有多少年青的天才遭到了扼杀、埋没。可是，今天的情况完全不同了。在社会主义制度下，在党的关怀和培养下，少年儿童们可以受到最好的教育，他们的聪明才智可以得到最大限度的发展。社会主义建设大跃进和技术革命运动大发展，每天出现的不计其数的技术革新和创造项目，都激励着孩子们去从事科学技术的试验研究；共产主义的宏伟远景和征服宇宙的美丽理想，更吸引他们去刻苦钻研科学，探索宇宙奥秘。特别是深入贯彻了党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针以后，学生在生产劳动的实践中遇到了大量的、实际的科学技术问题，也经常推动他们去进一步探索。上海五十一中学学生何宗川，在电机厂劳动中受到启发，下苦功钻研了大学课程中的基尔霍夫定理和垒加方程等知识，制成了生产上需用的惠斯登电桥。这一事实，生动地说明了我们必须充分地估计到今天青、少年强烈的求知欲望和充沛的创造能力，除了对他们加强课堂教学之外，必须积极地开展课外科学技术活动，从多方面满足他们的要求，引导他们钻研科学技术，从小就树立起
  “战胜地球、建立强国、攀登科学高峰”的雄心大志和热爱劳动、不畏艰苦的优良品德。北京、上海的事实，完全证明，只要我们领导得好，安排得当，就可以充分发挥孩子们的积极性和创造性，青、少年的科学技术活动是大有可为的。
    目前，青、少年的科学技术活动，不仅在北京、上海，而且在全国许多地方已经开展起来。但是，发展还很不平衡，活动还不够广泛深入，还远远赶不上形势发展的需要。今后，只要各级党委、共青团、科学技术协会以及其他有关单位，切实地重视这项工作，加强领导，使科学技术活动密切与教学和生产劳动相结合，放手发动群众，不论城市、乡村，任何地区都可以把青、少年科学技术活动开展得生气勃勃，有声有色。
    根据北京、上海的经验，要把青、少年科学技术活动开展得好，首先必须坚决贯彻党的教育方针。教育为无产阶级政治服务，在活动中引导青、少年学生关心政治，关心国家建设事业，认识到开展科学技术活动是为了将来更好地为祖国服务，使他们在进行科学技术活动时，不单是凭个人兴趣，而充满着政治热情。教育与生产劳动相结合，使青、少年的科学技术活动和教学、生产劳动结合起来，既能动脑又能动手，理论联系实际，在活动中扩大知识，锻炼思想。目前很多地区正在开展农业科学技术研究、工艺技术普及和无线电等活动，通过办小农场、百花园、气象哨、小工厂以及各种试验制作活动，使学生获得更加丰富的数学、物理、化学、生物等知识，提高了思想，而且还作出重要的研究成果和作品，大大地提高了教学质量。
    其次，开展青、少年科学技术活动也必须走群众路线，大搞群众运动。青、少年科学技术活动绝不能仅仅是几个“天才”学生的活动，而应当是大多数学生的活动；不能只靠少数几个人去组织，而应当广泛地发动各方面的力量都来关心和支持。组织辅导力量也要依靠群众，除教师之外，广大的工人、农民、科学技术人员、学生家长都是辅导人员。学生中的积极分子也可以用来当“小先生”，能者为师，层层传授。只靠教师和辅导人员的科学技术知识是难以满足青、少年活动的要求的，应当采取办讲座和训练班等办法加以培训提高。各地科学技术协会应当义不容辞地担当起这个工作，发挥积极作用。活动开展初期，要大抓思想发动，大讲开展青、少年科学技术活动的战略意义，克服形形色色的保守思想。同时，抓典型，树标兵，造声势，推动运动全面发展。活动的方式应当因地制宜，多种多样，阵地活动（如少年宫、少年之家等）与小型分散活动并举，并以小型活动为主，由初级到高级，由一般到尖端，土法上马，土洋并举，逐步提高，务使能适合多数青、少年参加。文化馆、图书馆、俱乐部以及公共食堂，都无不可以利用来作为青、少年开展活动的场所。开展活动的器材、条件，主要应依靠群众自力更生来解决，提倡少花钱多办事，不花钱也办事，“在山靠山，在水靠水”。上海句容路小学电工组一把鎯头、一把钳子，利用瓶瓶罐罐，就作出了五百五十多件科学技术作品；北京有的学校用纸盒子做耳机，废蜡纸绕铁丝代漆包线，同样制成了矿石收音机。这种勤俭办科学技术活动的精神是值得学习的。
    开展青、少年科学技术活动，还应当按照青、少年的特点来进行。活动内容要能提高思想、增长知识，有益于青、少年的身心健康；活动方式上还要注意生动活泼，不要生搬成人的一套；活动量的安排要照顾到政治学习、课堂作业、文体活动和休息睡眠时间，不要过于紧张，影响青、少年学业和健康，妨碍了全面发展。
    全面、广泛、深入地开展青、少年科学技术活动的任务，必须在党的领导下，组织各方面的力量来共同完成。教育部门应将这项工作作为自己教育工作的一个部分，列入议程，统一组织和安排，组织教师积极开展这一活动；共青团应当成为党开展青、少年科学技术活动中最活跃的助手，通过团、队组织，发动和组织广大青、少年，充分发挥他们的积极性和创造性，把活动搞得丰富多彩；科学技术协会应当积极发动和组织科学技术力量，加强科学技术指导。教育工作者、科学技术工作者、工农革新家、文化艺术工作者，以及学生的家长，都应当来关心和支持这项活动。各种青、少年报刊和科学技术普及报刊、出版社、图书馆、广播电台（站）、电视台、电影制片厂等都应当编写和提供更多、更好的适合青、少年需要的文章、读物、广播节目和科学教育影片。我们深信，在各级党委领导下，充分发动群众，人人关心，大家动手，青、少年的科学技术活动一定可以迅速地蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。
