Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th -- Vientiane Radio broadcasted that at the opening ceremony of the talks between the Lao Kingdom Government delegation and the Lao Patriotic Front Party delegation in Vientiane yesterday, the heads of both delegations expressed their hopes for the negotiations in their speeches.

    Quinim Pholsena, head of the Kingdom Government delegation, said that the negotiations were to "seek measures to correctly implement the various provisions of the 1957 Vientiane Agreement signed under the Geneva Accords." He praised and thanked the Lao Patriotic Front Party for its patriotism, and also praised and welcomed the patriotism of the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le.

    Quinim Pholsena emphasized that these negotiations are of great significance, as they relate to the unity, independence, peace, and happiness of the nation and its people. He expressed his belief that with both sides possessing enthusiasm for the motherland and the same stance on a policy of peace and neutrality, the negotiations will be successful quickly.

    Phoumi Vongvichit, head of the Lao Patriotic Front Party delegation, said in his speech that the reason these negotiations could be held was due to the heroic struggle of people from all walks of life, including soldiers, police, civil servants, lawyers, youth, students, businessmen, workers, farmers, monks, for freedom and democratic rights. It was also due to the successful coup on August 9 by the officers and soldiers of the 2nd Parachute Battalion, along with the Vientiane army, police, civil servants, and all the people, under the command of the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le. He said that the Lao Patriotic Front Party welcomes the recent announcements by the Kingdom Government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma to implement a policy of peace and neutrality, as well as the resolute attitude shown towards the Phoumi-Nosavan traitorous clique, the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and the commencement of negotiations with the Lao fighting forces.

    He said that these negotiations are being held at a time when the Lao people throughout the country hope to stop the civil war, hope for national harmony, and hope that the country will pursue a genuine policy of peace and neutrality, and when the governments and people of peace-loving countries around the world are actively supporting the Lao people in their just struggle against the Phoumi-Nosavan clique, the running dogs of US imperialism, who are plotting to expand the Lao civil war and use Laos as a foreign colony and military base. Therefore, these negotiations are of great significance. He said, "The purpose and task of these negotiations are: to strictly and fully implement the Geneva Accords, the Vientiane Agreement, and the supplementary provisions made by both sides through consultation, in order to adapt to the current Lao situation, to restore the damaged national harmony, and to ensure that the peace and unity of the motherland are firmly established."

    Phoumi Vongvichit reiterated that the Lao Patriotic Front Party's unwavering stance is to achieve peace and neutrality, to realize a policy of national independence, dignity, democracy, unity, and national harmony, to support all efforts made by the government to resolutely implement the above-mentioned policies, and to conduct negotiations sincerely and cooperate with the government on the basis of mutual understanding. He expressed his belief that as long as both sides adopt a sincere attitude, these negotiations will definitely achieve satisfactory results.

    冯维希支持政府实现和平中立与民族和睦政策
    新华社河内12日电　据万象电台广播，在昨天老挝王国政府代表团同老挝爱国战线党的代表团在万象举行会谈的开始仪式上，双方代表团长都在讲话中表示了对谈判的希望。
    王国政府代表团团长贵宁·奔舍那说，这次谈判是为了“设法寻找正确履行根据日内瓦协议签订的1957年万象协议各项条款的措施”。他赞扬并且感谢老挝爱国战线党的爱国主义精神，同时也赞扬和欢迎以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会的爱国主义精神。
    贵宁·奔舍那强调说，这次谈判具有非常重要的意义，它关系到国家的统一、独立、和平和全国人民的幸福。他表示相信，双方具有对祖国的热情和相同的和平中立政策的立场，这次谈判将能迅速获得成功。
    老挝爱国战线党代表团团长冯维希在讲话中说，这次谈判之所以能够举行，是由于军队、警察、职员、律师、青年、学生、商人、工人、农民、僧侣等各阶层人民为了自由民主权利进行的英勇斗争的结果，也是由于伞兵第二营的官兵与万象军队、警察、职员和全体人民一起，在以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会的指挥下在8月9日发动政变成功的结果。他说，老挝爱国战线党对以梭发那·富马亲王为首的王国政府最近所宣布的将执行和平中立政策以及对富米—文翁叛国集团所表现的果断态度、同苏联建立外交关系和开始同寮国战斗部队举行谈判等行动，表示欢迎。
    他说，这次谈判是在老挝全国人民希望停止内战，希望民族和睦，希望国家奉行真正的和平中立政策，以及全世界爱好和平国家的政府和人民正在积极支持老挝人民展开反对美帝国主义的走狗富米—文翁集团阴谋扩大老挝内战、以老挝作为外国的殖民地和军事基地的正义斗争的时候开始举行的。因此，这次谈判具有非常重要意义。他说，“这次谈判的目的和任务是：严正和充分地履行日内瓦协议、万象协议以及双方通过协商作出的补充条款，以适应目前老挝局势，以恢复被破坏的民族和睦，使祖国的和平和统一得到牢固。”
    冯维希重申，老挝爱国战线党坚持不渝的立场是实现和平中立，实现民族的独立尊严民主、统一和民族和睦政策，支持政府对坚决实现上述政策所作出的一切努力，并且真诚地进行谈判，并在互相谅解的基础上同政府合作。他表示相信：只要双方都抱着诚恳态度我们的这次谈判将一定会取得美满的结果。
