Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, 4th Dispatch: According to reports, Abbas Ferhat, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, has cabled the heads of state of the member states of the "French Community," demanding that they take a clear stance on the Algerian question.

This was announced in a statement issued by the Information Department of the Algerian Provisional Government. The statement said that Prime Minister Abbas, in his telegram, drew their attention to "the importance that the Algerian government and people attach to taking a clear stance on the Algerian question as the UN debate on the Algerian issue approaches."

Prime Minister Abbas also raised the issue of the "Community" member states' armies being used by France to invade Algeria.

The statement said that in mentioning this issue, "Prime Minister Abbas expressed the hope that these countries will demonstrate their autonomy, impartiality, and solidarity."

Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, 29th Dispatch: The latest issue of "El Moudjahid," the organ of the Algerian National Liberation Front, stated in an editorial: "France's allies should understand that the Algerian revolution is genuine, and it will continue to advance regardless of the various conspiracies of these countries."

The editorial said: "Due to its deliberate collusion with France, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has proven to be a colonialist alliance against the freedom of all peoples. This year, facing the severe situation in Algeria, it is even more difficult for Western countries to conceal their true colors."

The editorial emphasized: "The 'generous' words spoken by Eisenhower on the UN platform do not change the reality that the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America are increasingly recognizing."

Exposing France's attempt to use the recently joined UN member states of the "French Community" to serve its purposes, the editorial pointed out: "These countries have no other way out but to sincerely and actively unite with their African brothers. Common interests bind these countries together. There is no room for taking a middle ground between the cause of Algeria, which is the cause of the entire Africa, and the designs of French colonialism. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria will adhere to its position and trust its friends."

The editorial went on to say that the Melun talks had exposed the double-dealing tactics of the French colonialists.

The editorial concluded by emphasizing: "With the support of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, heroic Algeria will ultimately defeat French colonialism and its allies. It will surely achieve independence."

    阿巴斯总理致电“法兰西共同体”成员国
    要求对阿尔及利亚问题采取明确立场
    “圣战者报”说阿尔及利亚在各国人民支持下必将获得独立
    新华社4日讯　突尼斯消息：据宣布，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯·费尔哈特已经打电报给“法兰西共同体”内各成员国的首脑，要求他们在阿尔及利亚问题上采取明确的立场。
    这是由阿尔及利亚临时政府新闻部发表的一项公告所宣布的。公告说，阿巴斯总理在电报中提请他们注意：“阿尔及利亚政府和人民对于当联合国辩论阿尔及利亚问题迫近的时候在阿尔及利亚问题上采取明确立场的重视”。
    阿巴斯总理还提出“共同体”成员国军队被法国利用来侵略阿尔及利亚的问题。
    公告说，在提到这个问题的时候，“阿巴斯总理表示希望这些国家将证明它们的自主、公正和团结”。
    新华社拉巴特29日电　最近一期的阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线机关报“圣战者报”在社论中说：“法国的各同盟国应当明白，阿尔及利亚革命是名符其实的，它将不顾上述这些国家的种种阴谋诡计而继续不断前进。”
    社论说：“由于蓄意同法国勾结在一起，北大西洋公约组织已被证明是反对各族人民自由的殖民主义联盟。今年，由于面临着阿尔及利亚的严重局势，西方国家更难于掩盖它们的真面目。”
    社论强调指出：“艾森豪威尔在联合国讲坛上说的那番‘慷慨’言辞一点也改变不了非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲各国人民愈来愈认清的这一现实。”
    社论在揭露法国企图利用最近加入联合国的“法兰西共同体”成员国来为它服务的阴谋时指出：“这些国家除了和它们的非洲兄弟国家真诚地积极团结一致以外，别无其他出路。共同的利益把这些国家联结在一起。在阿尔及利亚的事业，也就是整个非洲的事业，同法国殖民主义的图谋之间，没有采取中间态度的余地。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府将坚持自己的立场，信任它的朋友们。”
    社论接着说：默伦会谈已经使法国殖民主义者的两面手法暴露无遗。
    社论最后强调指出：“在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的支持下，英雄的阿尔及利亚终将战胜法国殖民主义及其同盟者。它定将获得独立”。
