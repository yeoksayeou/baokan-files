Xinhua News Agency: Currently, it is the peak season for sweet potato harvesting. In China's major sweet potato producing provinces, such as Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui, a climax of rushing to harvest sweet potatoes has been set off. The southern sweet potato producing areas, where the harvest season is later, are also about to begin sweet potato harvesting.

Sweet potatoes are high-yield crops. This year, under the guidance of the policy of taking grain as the key link, simultaneously pursuing diversified planting and increased harvests, and high-yield and increased harvests, various regions have actively expanded the sweet potato planting area. In particular, the summer sweet potato planting area in the Yellow River and Huai River basins, the main sweet potato producing areas, has significantly increased compared to previous years. Therefore, the task of harvesting sweet potatoes this year is very large. The leading authorities in various sweet potato producing regions, based on the characteristics of this year's large sweet potato harvest area and the heavy tasks of storage and preservation, made preparations for sweet potato harvesting early on. After the summer harvest, many people's communes began to create, modify, and repair sweet potato slicing and drying tools, renovate and build new sweet potato cellars, and mobilized veteran farmers, technicians, and commune members to jointly summarize the experience of sweet potato harvesting over the years. In mid-September, counties such as Ye County, Wendeng, and Qufu in Shandong Province successively convened sweet potato storage meetings, led by the county party secretary, to summarize sweet potato harvesting experience and study measures. In late September, Huaiyin Prefecture in Jiangsu Province also convened a sweet potato harvesting professional meeting to specifically study the harvesting, drying, processing, storage, and management of sweet potatoes. Currently, all sweet potato producing areas have listed sweet potato harvesting as a major part of the autumn harvest work, arranged relatively sufficient labor, and are stepping up harvesting according to weather changes. In She County, Hebei Province, the county party secretary took the lead in establishing a sweet potato harvesting and management front, and implemented a responsibility system from harvesting and digging, processing to cellaring and management, striving not to lose a single sweet potato. Yanshan County in this province has already harvested 50,000 mu of sweet potatoes, of which 40,000 mu of sweet potatoes have been sliced and dried. In Nanyang Prefecture, Henan Province, half of the sweet potatoes already harvested in ten counties have also been sliced and dried. During the sweet potato harvest, various regions have also paid attention to doing a good job in sweet potato seed retention for the needs of expanding planting next year.

Xinhua News Agency: People's communes in various parts of Henan are seizing time, striving for the initiative, and actively carrying out preparations for sweet potato harvesting, slicing, and storage, striving to ensure that every tuber, stem, and leaf is not lost, abandoned, moldy, or rotten, and is harvested cleanly and stored well. Agricultural and grain departments at all levels have successively established temporary offices, and communes and teams have established collection command posts to specifically lead this work. Many people's communes in Kaifeng, Xinxiang, Xuchang, and other prefectures have recently organized cadres, veteran farmers, and technicians to go deep into the fields and classify sweet potatoes plot by plot. Based on variety, distance, and maturity, they have separately designated plots for seed retention, slicing, and consumption, and have marked and labeled them with the planning, assigning them to teams and groups. At the same time, specific arrangements have also been made for harvesting tools, tasks, time, and leadership.

Based on the characteristics of this year's large sweet potato area, good growth, and the large tasks of harvesting and slicing, and the high requirements for harvesting quality, various regions have promptly made preparations for collection and storage. By the end of September, the province had newly manufactured and repaired more than 150,000 various slicers, plus the original ones, there were more than 450,000 slicers, accounting for 75% of the required amount. A slicer can generally slice 3,000 to 4,000 catties per day. The power fast slicer created by the Zhuji Commune in Huaiyang County can slice up to 120,000 catties per day. Tools for harvesting, such as grab hooks and iron forks, have also been basically prepared. Employees of many county and commune-run factories have also successfully created various types of digging machines with high efficiency and good harvesting quality. The digging machine created by the Gucheng Commune in Dengfeng County has been tested and found to improve work efficiency five times compared to iron fork digging, with good results. To prevent rain from affecting slicing and drying, various regions have also prepared many drying kangs.

In order to store sweet potato seeds and some fresh sweet potatoes for next year, various regions have comprehensively inspected and compared sweet potato cellars, selecting the best among the best, and summarized and promoted many sweet potato cellars that have been tested for several years and have the advantages of preventing mold, spots, freezing, and heat. In addition to actively repairing existing warehouses, various regions have also adopted simple methods to build warehouses. (Attached picture)

In order to carefully harvest sweet potatoes and recover all the tubers, leaves, and vines, the Pingyuan Commune in Licheng County, Shandong Province, adopted a six-step sweet potato harvesting and storage method: digging sweet potato tubers, picking fresh leaves, cutting vines, sweeping fallen leaves, re-collecting, and slicing and drying sweet potato chips.

    建立专业战线　推行责任制度　提早备足工具
    甘薯主要产区掀起收薯高潮
    河南各地公社抢时间争主动及早安排甘薯收藏工作
    据新华社讯　目前正是甘薯的盛收时节。我国甘薯主要产区河南、河北、山东、江苏和安徽等省已掀起了抢收甘薯的高潮，收获期较晚的南方甘薯产区，也即将开始收薯工作。
    甘薯是高产作物。今年各地在以粮为纲，多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针指导下，积极扩大了甘薯种植面积，特别是主要产薯区的黄河和淮河流域，夏甘薯种植面积比往年有显著增加。因此，今年收获甘薯的任务很大。各产薯地区的领导机关，根据今年甘薯收获面积大和贮藏、保管任务重的特点，都及早地安排了收薯的准备工作。夏收以后，许多人民公社就着手创制、改制、修补甘薯切片、晒干工具，整修、新修薯窖，发动老农、技术员和社员共同总结历年收薯的经验。山东省掖县、文登、曲阜等县，在9月中旬就先后召开了甘薯收藏会议，由县委书记挂帅总结收薯经验，研究措施。江苏省淮阴专区也在9月下旬召开了收薯专业会议，具体地研究了甘薯的收、晒、加工、储藏和管理工作。目前，各产薯区都把收薯列为秋收工作的一项主要内容，安排了比较充足的劳力，并根据天气变化情况加紧收获。河北省涉县由县委书记挂帅，建立了甘薯收、管战线，从收刨、加工到入窖、管理，都推行了责任制，力争不丢一块甘薯，这个省的盐山县已经收获甘薯五万亩，其中四万亩的甘薯已经切片晒干。河南省南阳专区十个县已收的甘薯也有一半已经切片晒干。在收薯中，各地还注意做好甘薯的留种工作，以备明年扩大种植的需要。
    据新华社讯　河南各地人民公社抢时间，争主动，积极进行甘薯收刨、切片、储藏等准备工作，力争块块、梗梗、叶叶不丢、不弃、不霉、不烂，收净藏好。各级农业、粮食部门相继设立了临时办公室，社、队已建立收藏指挥部，专门领导这一工作。开封、新乡、许昌等专区的许多人民公社，最近组织干部、老农和技术员深入田间，逐方逐块进行甘薯分类站队，根据品种、远近和成熟期，分别划出留种、切片、食用等地块，随规划随插标挂牌，落实到队、到组。同时，对收获的工具、任务、时间、领导等，也都作了具体安排。
    各地根据今年甘薯面积大、生长好和收刨切片任务大、收刨质量要求高的特点，及时做好收藏准备工作。到9月底止，全省新制和修理的各种切片机已有十五万多部，加上原有的共已备好四十五万多部切片机，占需要量的75％。一部切片机一般每天能切片三千到四千斤。淮阳县朱集公社创制的动力快速切片机，日切片高达十二万斤。收刨用的抓钩、铁杈等工具也已基本备齐。不少县、社营工厂的职工，还创制成功了各式各样效率高、收刨质量好的掘刨机。登封县古城公社创制的掘刨机经过试用，比铁杈刨薯提高工效五倍，效果良好。为了预防因雨影响切片晒干，各地还准备了许多烘干炕。
    为了把明年用的薯种和一部分鲜薯藏好，各地对薯窖全面进行了检查评比，优中选优，总结和推广了许多经过几年考验，具有防止霉烂、病斑、冻、热等优点的薯窖。各地除积极检修现有仓房外，并采取因陋就简办法修造仓房。（附图片）
    山东历城县平原公社为了细收甘薯，使薯块、叶、蔓全部收回，采取了刨薯块、摘鲜叶、割蔓、扫落叶、复收和切晒薯干六道工序的甘薯收、藏方法。左图：公社的小学生正在帮助生产队摘薯叶。
