    Strong People, Burning Hearts
    -- On the Support of Autumn Harvest by Convalescents of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers’ Convalescent Home
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Sun Yuedong
    Those who have seen the movie "The Strongest Man" or the extracurricular performance team of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Convalescent Home are deeply moved by the strong will and revolutionary optimism of these revolutionary fighters. Recently, in the upsurge of the whole people supporting agriculture, these strongest people have once again demonstrated their unparalleled enthusiasm for the socialist construction of the motherland.

    Before the start of the autumn harvest, the convalescents studied the People's Daily editorial: "The whole party and the whole people mobilize to run agriculture and grain in a big way" and "Immediately launch a production increase and economy movement centered on grain and steel," and展开了热烈的讨论。(zhǎnkāile rèliè de tǎolùn) launched a heated discussion. In the discussion, some comrades said: "It is better to look at the near than to talk about the far; everyone sees that the mid-season rice in the fields outside is ripe, and our neighbors in the Wan'an Commune are too busy with labor. We can't talk about increasing production and practicing economy on the one hand, and watch the rice grains swelling in the fields being scattered in the wind and rain on the other." After the study and discussion, everyone posted many large-character posters, proposing to actively support the Wan'an Commune in rushing to harvest rice, and actively carry out preparations for supporting the autumn harvest. Luo Xiucheng, a convalescent who was blind in both eyes, groped his way to the nearby supply and marketing cooperative department as soon as the study discussion was over, and bought a new sickle to prepare the "weapon" for harvesting.

    In recent years, whether it is the summer harvest or the autumn harvest, these strongest people have actively supported it, and almost everyone has a sickle or other small farm tools. However, this year's autumn harvest is slightly different from previous years. Because it had rained for several days in a row, the rice fields that had been drained of water were filled with water again, and people sank deep into the mud when they stepped on them. It is very difficult for comrades with severe physical disabilities like those in the convalescent home, especially those who are blind in both eyes and those with disabilities in their lower limbs, to go to the fields to harvest. The party committee at a higher level cared about everyone's health and advised everyone to cancel this autumn harvest support. However, many convalescents could not suppress their enthusiasm for supporting agriculture. As soon as the weather cleared, they took their sickles and followed behind the convalescent home staff's support and rush-harvesting team. In order to avoid the attention of leading cadres, some walked around in twos and threes. Mo Dingliu, a convalescent with burns on both legs, was seen by captain Xu Houxian when he was about to set off. He repeatedly advised him to pay attention to his health, but he still sneaked towards the fields. He met Captain Xu Houxian again at the edge of the field, and seeing that Captain Xu was also holding a sickle in his hand, he asked with a smile: "Captain Xu, you advise others not to come, but what are you doing with a sickle now?" Everyone laughed at what he said. Captain Xu Houxian is a first-class disabled person with one eye blind and the other with only a faint light. His health is worse than that of Mo Dingliu. However, this captain who advised others to pay attention to their health also rushed over himself. In front of comrades whose disabilities were lighter than his own, Captain Xu did not admit defeat. He said to Mo Dingliu: "My body is stronger than yours, if you don't believe me, let's have a competition." So, the two of them started a rice-cutting competition. The conditions of the competition were: each person harvests ten rows to see who can cut faster, cleaner, put them neatly, and not waste them. Xu Houxian waved his sickle with his agile hand and cut it with a "cha cha" sound. However, his eyes were not good. Only one eye could see a little, and he had to bend over and exert a lot of effort to find the place to cut the rice roots when he encountered the rice that was lying down. Sometimes after he finished cutting a section, he would ask Mo Dingliu behind him: "Help me see if it is cut clean? Is there anything lost?" This Communist Party member overcame difficulties in this way, and not only cut it very cleanly, but also quickly, taking the lead. Although Mo Dingliu had good eyes and could see accurately, his disabled hands did not obey his commands. His left hand could not hold the rice stalks firmly, so he had to cut them in small bundles; others cut them in one bundle, and he had to divide them into two bundles. This Communist Youth League member overcame difficulties and improved his work efficiency, and finally caught up with Xu Houxian, and the two completed the task at the same time.

    At this time, in front of the eighty-odd person army supporting the rush harvest, a large area of rice had been cut down. However, there were more people cutting than threshing, and the rice could not be collected as soon as possible. This was because there were not many people who could thresh the rice. First, the convalescents had limited physical strength and it was difficult to operate. Second, threshing and shelling required certain skills. At this time, Captain Xu Houxian suggested participating in threshing, and wanted to compete with Mo Dingliu again. The two came to a mixing barrel, picked up the grain and started threshing. The skills of the two were comparable. Both of them, one with bad eyes and the other with inflexible hands, were afraid of not threshing cleanly. Therefore, after each threshing for a while, Mo Dingliu, who had good eyes, carefully checked to see if the threshed straw was cleaned.

    During the seven or eight days of support for the rush harvest, all the convalescents who could work took part in it. Some who had not fully recovered from their illnesses and injuries also insisted on participating in the rush harvest. Yang Mingqing was such a person. He is still undergoing massage therapy, but at the beginning of this support for the rush harvest, he resolutely requested to participate. He said to the doctor: "Doctor, please change the massage operation to a rainy day, on a sunny day, I feel very normal and do not need a massage." The doctor did not understand what this meant, but later found out that Yang Mingqing was eager to take advantage of the sunny day to go to the commune to support the rush harvest. Because Yang Mingqing had undergone surgery on his internal organs, he would pant if he bent over for too long, but this did not stump this strong man. He bent down and waved his sickle to cut for a while, stood up to rest for a while, and then bent down to continue working. He rushed to harvest side by side with everyone in this way. Others advised him to rest for a while, but he always said: "Not tired, not tired."

    These strong people, like people seen in movies or on the stage, laughed, talked, sang, and danced in the midst of tense labor, full of revolutionary optimism. Convalescent Fu Kaizhi, while rushing to harvest, composed a lyrics of a song "Happy a Group of Larks", praising this year's bumper rice harvest in the commune. After the lyrics were written, the other comrades of the performance team set it to music, and everyone sang it:
    "The sky is clear, the red sun is high,
    Colorful clouds are floating in the sky,
    The boundless rice fields are shining with golden light,
    The heavy ears of rice are bent over..."

    The strong revolutionary will and ardent enthusiasm of these convalescents deeply moved the broad masses of commune members of Wan'an Commune. Their enthusiasm for production is even higher and their energy is even greater. They have decided to plow and prepare the land in time after the rice harvest, and plant another season of late autumn crops before the spring sowing. At present, more than 5,700 mu of late autumn crops have been sown in the whole commune. The commune members are carefully managing them and striving for high yields.

    坚强的人　火热的心
    ——记四川省革命残废军人教养院休养员支援秋收
    新华社记者　孙跃冬
    看过电影“最坚强的人”或四川省革命残废军人教养院课余演出队表演的人们，没有哪一个不为这些革命战士那种坚强意志和革命乐观主义精神所深深感动。最近，在全民支援农业的热潮里，这些最坚强的人，又再一次表现出他们对祖国社会主义建设事业的无比热情。
    在秋收开始以前，休养员们学习了人民日报社论：“全党动手全民动手大办农业大办粮食”和“立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动”，并展开了热烈的讨论。在讨论中，有的同志说：“说远处不如看近处；大家看，外面田里的中稻已经熟了，我们的邻居万安公社的劳力忙不过来，我们大家可不能一边谈增产节约，一边眼看着田里胀鼓鼓的稻粒在风雨中抛撒。”学习讨论结束后，大家贴出了许多张大字报，提出要积极支援万安公社抢收水稻，并积极进行支援秋收的准备工作。双目失明的休养员罗秀成，在学习讨论会一散，就摸索着到附近供销社门市部买回一把新镰刀，把收割的“武器”准备好。
    最近几年来，不论夏收和秋收，这些最坚强的人都积极支援，他们几乎每个人都有镰刀或其它小农具。可是今年的秋收与往年稍有不同。因为接连落了几天雨，原来已经排干了水的稻田又积满了水，脚踩上去要陷进泥里很深。像教养院那样一些身体严重残废的同志，特别是双目失明和下肢残废的人，下田收割是很困难的。上级党委关怀大家的身体健康，劝告大家取消这次秋收支援。但是，许多休养员却压抑不住心头支援农业的热情，天气一放晴，他们就拿着镰刀，跟在教养院工作人员支援抢收队伍的后面出发了。为了躲避领导干部的注意，有的三三两两绕着道走。两肢烧伤的休养员莫定柳，临要出发时被队长徐厚贤看见了，一再劝他注意自己身体健康，但是他还是偷着向田野走去。他在田边上又碰上了队长徐厚贤，看见徐队长手里也拿着镰刀，便笑着问道：“徐队长，你劝别人不要来，可是你现在拿把镰刀来做啥？”说得大家都笑起来。队长徐厚贤是一目失明一目微光的一等残废，身体比莫定柳还要差，但是这位劝别人注意身体的队长，自己却也赶来了。在残废情况比自己轻的同志面前，徐队长并不服输，他对莫定柳说：“我的身体比你壮，不信，咱们比比看。”于是，他们两个人展开了一场割稻比赛。比赛的条件是：每人收割十行，看谁割得快，割得干净，放得整齐，不抛撒浪费。徐厚贤用他那只灵活敏捷的手，挥动着镰刀，嚓嚓地割着。但是他的眼睛却不好，只有一只眼睛能微微看到一点，又遇上割的稻谷倒伏了，他寻找稻根下刀处，要弯着腰费很大力气。有时他每割完一段，就问身后的莫定柳：“帮我看看割干净没有？有没有丢掉的？”这个共产党员就是这样克服了困难，不但割得十分干净，而且速度也快，一马当先走在前头。莫定柳虽然有一双好眼睛，瞅得准，但是他残废的双手不听使唤，左手拿不稳稻把子，只好一小把、一小把地割；别人割的一把，他要分做两把来割。这个共青团员克服困难提高了工效，最后终于赶上了徐厚贤，两人同时完成了任务。
    这时候，在八十多名支援抢收大军面前，稻谷已割倒了一大片。但是割的人多，打的人少，稻谷还是不能尽快收起来。这是因为能打谷的人手不多，一来休养员体力有限，操作困难，二来打谷脱粒需要有一定的技术。这时，队长徐厚贤提议去参加打谷，要再和莫定柳较量一下。两个人来到一架拌桶前面，抱起谷子就打起来，两人的技术都不差上下。他们两个人，一个眼睛不好，一个双手不灵，都怕打不干净。于是，每打一会儿，就由眼睛好的莫定柳仔细检查一下，看看打过的稻草打干净没有。
    在前后为期七、八天的支援抢收期间，休养员们只要能出工的，个个都争先恐后地参加。有的病伤还没有完全好的，也坚持参加抢收。杨明清就是这样一个人。他现在还在施行按摩治疗，但是在这次支援抢收一开始，他便毅然要求参加。他对医生说：“大夫，请把按摩手术改在阴雨天再施行吧，晴天，我感到身体很正常，用不着按摩。”医生不了解这是什么道理，后来打听到，原来杨明清急于要趁着晴天去公社支援抢收。杨明清因为内脏动过手术，稍稍弯腰久了，就会发生气喘，但是这并没有难倒这个坚强的人。他弯下腰挥动着镰刀割一会，站起来休息一下，然后再弯下腰继续干活。他就是这样一弯一起地和大家并肩抢收。别人劝他多休息一会，他总是说：“不累，不累”。
    这些坚强的人在紧张的劳动中，也像人们在电影上或舞台上看到的一样，有说有笑，又唱又跳，充满着革命的乐观主义精神。休养员傅开志，一边抢收，一边创作了一首歌词“乐坏了一群百灵鸟”，歌颂今年公社的水稻丰收。歌词写出后，演出队的其他同志给谱上曲调，大家唱了起来：
    “晴空万里红日高，
    朵朵彩云天上飘，
    无边的稻田金光闪耀，
    沉甸甸的稻穗压弯了腰……”
    这些休养员的坚强革命意志和火热的支援热情，深深感动了万安公社的广大社员。他们的生产热情更高，干劲更大，决定在水稻收割以后，及时犁田整地，在小春播种之前多种一季晚秋。现在，全社已播种晚秋作物五千七百多亩。社员们正在精心管理，力争高产。
