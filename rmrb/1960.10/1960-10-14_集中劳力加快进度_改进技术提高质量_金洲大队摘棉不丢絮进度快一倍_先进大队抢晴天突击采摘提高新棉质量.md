    Nanchang, October 13th (Reported by this newspaper) – The Jinzhou Brigade of Jiangbei Commune in Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, has mobilized labor to seize the opportunity to rush-harvest cotton, capitalizing on the early and uniform boll opening characteristics of this year's cotton crop.

    Concentrating labor and deeply engaging in a red banner labor competition focused on high efficiency and high quality is a key measure taken by the Jinzhou Brigade to ensure a good cotton harvest. Previously, only three to four hundred laborers participated in cotton picking daily, with a daily harvesting progress of only about 20,000 jin. In response to this situation, the brigade decided to concentrate labor from less urgent and temporarily deferrable agricultural tasks on cotton picking and drying. Through a comprehensive review and rational allocation of labor, the entire brigade increased the number of participants in cotton picking from 400 to approximately 700. After a large number of laborers were concentrated on the cotton harvesting front, the brigade and each production team immediately launched a "three comparisons" competition – comparing progress, efficiency, and quality. Through evaluation and competition, the harvesting progress was greatly accelerated, and the quality of harvesting was improved. Since the beginning of the harvest, the entire brigade has held four evaluations, selecting thirty-eight cotton picking pacesetters. These pacesetters served as role models for all cotton farmers and strongly promoted the harvesting progress. Wei Dangxiao, a cotton picking expert, adopted a method of picking cotton with both hands while stepping sideways, harvesting 220 jin of cotton per day. After this experience was promoted to various production teams, the daily harvesting progress of the entire brigade doubled, increasing from the original 20,000 jin to 45,000 jin. The quality of harvesting has also greatly improved. According to the brigade's inspection team, the harvested cotton this year generally achieves cleanliness inside the boll, in the field, along the roadsides, and in the drying grounds.

    Centralized picking, centralized weighing, centralized drying, and centralized sales are innovative measures adopted by the Jinzhou Brigade. Based on the past years' experience of decentralized harvesting and inconvenient management, the brigade party branch promoted this year the practice of centralized cotton picking by teams or joint teams, centralized weighing at the fields or warehouses by teams, centralized drying by teams, and centralized sales by the brigade. These methods have proven very effective, mainly in four aspects: First, output is confirmed at each harvest; second, collective harvesting facilitates labor competitions, accelerates the harvesting progress, and improves the quality of harvesting. This year's field harvesting work generally achieves "dual creation" harvesting, that is, checking ahead and re-inspecting behind, picking and selecting simultaneously, and checking each plant, branch, boll, and petal to ensure no "eye mucus hair" is left. During transportation, each production team uses pockets, sacks, and ox carts to ensure the ground and roads are clean and not a single cotton boll is lost. Third, waste is reduced, and a large amount of labor is saved. In the past, drying cotton was distributed to each household, requiring a lot of labor. Now, only two or three laborers are needed in a production team to handle the entire team's drying tasks. This alone has saved more than seventy laborers in the entire brigade. Fourth, safety can be ensured, facilitating fire prevention and accident prevention. The comprehensive implementation of collective transportation, drying, and storage has made cotton management more thorough and perfect.

    In order to better improve the quality of harvesting and strengthen the management of new cotton, the production teams paid special attention to classifying cotton during harvesting, drying, and storage, grading acceptance, keeping separate accounts, drying in separate areas, and storing in separate warehouses, so as to separate and store good cotton, inferior cotton. In the picking of new cotton, the cotton farmers adopted the "double pocket" method of picking cotton, using two cotton picking pockets to separate good and inferior cotton; the custodians and acceptance personnel graded and accepted separately and kept separate accounts. When drying the new cotton, they strictly implemented the principle of drying good cotton, seed cotton, and inferior cotton in separate areas and storing them in separate warehouses. These measures not only ensured that good cotton was not downgraded and implemented reasonable distribution, but also avoided seed mixing and the spread of pests and diseases, and prepared for seed selection.

    To date, the Jinzhou Brigade has harvested 700,000 jin of cotton, accounting for half of the annual planned output, equivalent to more than 80% of last year's total output. 80% of the harvested new cotton has been dried and graded. At the same time, they have achieved drying and selling in batches, and the new cotton sold is mostly second and third grade cotton.

    Xi'an, October 13th (Reported by this newspaper) – Cotton farmers in the Advanced Production Team of Jingyang Commune in Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province, are working hard to improve cotton picking techniques and cotton quality, striving to sell more good cotton to the state.

    The Guanzhong area has a lot of overcast and rainy weather. How to harvest new cotton well under continuous autumn rain is a matter of great concern to the commune members. As early as the beginning of August, the Advanced Team Branch of the Communist Party convened a meeting of cadres above the level of small team leader to specifically study measures to carefully harvest, thoroughly harvest, and harvest good cotton. The branch educated the commune members with the different results of the different practices of the Seventh Small Team and the Second Small Team in cotton picking last year, and achieved very good results. The Seventh Small Team planted more than 340 mu of cotton last year, with a yield of 86 jin per mu. Because all the team members worked hard to improve their techniques, harvested in a timely manner, and insisted on separating the harvest and drying, the quality of cotton was improved; the Second Small Team planted the same number of mu of cotton and had the same yield as the Seventh Small Team, but the quality of cotton was reduced due to rough harvesting work. As a result, although the amount of cotton sold by the two small teams was equal, the Seventh Small Team sold more than 1,400 yuan more than the Second Small Team. This example made the commune members deeply realize that harvesting good cotton and selling good cotton not only increases collective income, but more importantly supports national construction. In order to rush to harvest cotton on sunny days, each team has special personnel to strengthen weather forecasting. For example, one day after each team heard the news that it was going to rain, they immediately dispatched more than 1,100 laborers to rush to harvest cotton, so that 20,000 jin of cotton that matured and opened its bolls that day avoided the harm of overcast and rainy weather.

    The Advanced Team members also promoted advanced cotton picking experience, improved cotton picking techniques, and improved cotton quality. Zhao Huifang, a female commune member of the Fifth Small Team, picks more than 110 jin of cotton a day, and the cotton she picks has no impurities. Zhao Huifang's main experience is: when picking cotton, first use her left hand to hit the old leaves at the base of the cotton boll, then grab the flower stalk, and pinch the five petals with the five fingers of her right hand. This is both fast, does not leave eyelashes, and avoids broken leaves sticking to the cotton wool. The party branch immediately organized commune members from several nearby small teams to learn on the spot. Under the slogan of "Learn from Huifang and surpass Huifang", the Sixth Small Team increased the progress of cotton picking from an average of 40 jin per person per day to 90 jin. Then each team also established its own pacesetters according to the land and people, improved cotton picking operation techniques, and the entire brigade has increased from the original 5,000 jin per day to 7,200 jin per day.

    In order to make the process from picking to drying and from drying to selling all linked together, the Advanced Production Team also specially fixed ten large carts, twenty-nine trolleys, and three hundred and seventy back baskets and other transportation tools to achieve picking, drying, and selling at the same time. Up to now, the team has sold more than 21,000 jin of new cotton to the state.

    集中劳力加快进度　改进技术提高质量
    金洲大队摘棉不丢絮进度快一倍
    先进大队抢晴天突击采摘提高新棉质量
    本报南昌13日电　江西彭泽县江北公社金洲大队，根据今年棉花吐絮早、成熟一致的特点，调集劳力突击抢摘。
    集中劳动力，深入地开展高工效、高质量为主要内容的红旗劳动竞赛，是金洲大队收好棉花的一项主要措施。这个大队原来每天参加收花的劳动力只有三、四百人，收花日进度只有二万斤左右。根据这一情况，大队决定把分散使用和暂时可以缓办的农活所占用的劳动力都集中摘花或晒花。全大队通过全面清查和合理安排劳力，使参加收花的人由四百名增加到七百名左右。大批劳力集中到收花战线后，大队和各生产小队又立即组织群众掀起了一个比进度、比工效、比质量的“三比”竞赛高潮。通过评比竞赛，大大地加快了收花进度，提高了收花质量。全大队从收花开始，通过四次评比，评出了三十八名收花标兵，这些标兵为全队棉农树立了榜样，有力地推动了收花进度。采棉能手魏垱小采用双手、侧退摘棉法，日摘棉花二百二十斤的经验，推广到各生产小队以后，全大队收花日进度提高一倍，由原来二万斤提高到四万五千斤。收花质量也大有提高，根据大队验收小组检查，今年收的花一般都做到了壳里净、地里净、路边净、晒场净。
    集中分摘、集中过秤、集中晒花、集中交售，这是金洲大队采取的一项革新措施。大队党支部根据历年分散收花，管理不便的情况，今年推行以小队或联队集中分摘棉花，以小队为单位集中在田头或到仓库地点进行过秤，以小队为单位集中分场晒花，以大队为单位集中出售，这些办法收效很好。主要好处有四：一、一次采棉一次落实产量；二、实行集体收花，有利于开展劳动竞赛，加快采摘进度、提高收花质量。今年的田间收花工作，普遍都做到了“双造”摘花，即前面检花，后面复查，边摘边拣，逐株、逐枝、逐桃、逐瓣检查，作到了摘花不留“眼屎毛”。在拉运中，各生产小队都采用口袋、麻袋、牛车装运，作到了地净路净，不丢一瓣棉。三、减少了浪费，节省了大批劳力。过去晒花分到每家每户，占用的劳动力很多，现在一个生产小队只要两、三个劳动力就可负担全队的晒花任务。仅这一项，全大队已经节省了七十多个劳动力。四、可以保证安全，便于防火防事故。由于全面实行了集体运晒，集体保管，这就使棉花管理工作做得更加周全完善。
    为了更好地提高收花质量，加强新棉收管工作，各生产小队在收、晒、藏花中，还特别注意了分类摘花、分级验收、分别记账、分场晒花、分仓保管，做到把好花、次花分收、分晒、分藏、分别记账。在采摘新棉中，广大棉农都采用了“双兜”摘棉法，一人用两个摘棉兜，把好、次花分开装；保管员和验收员分级验收、分别记账，在翻晒新棉时，严格执行了把好棉、种子棉、次棉分场晒、分仓保管。采取这些办法，不仅保证了好花不降级，贯彻了合理分配，避免了种子混杂和病虫害的传染，也为选留种子作好了准备工作。
    到目前止，金洲大队已经收回的棉花达七十万斤，占年计划产量一半，相等于去年总产量80％以上，收回的新棉80％做到了晒干、分好级。同时做到了晒好一批，出售一批，而且交售的新棉大多数都是二、三级的棉花。
    本报西安13日电　陕西省三原县泾阳公社先进生产队的棉农，努力改进摘棉技术，提高棉花质量，力争多售好棉给国家。
    关中地区多阴雨，如何在秋雨连绵的情况下收好新棉，这是社员们非常关心的问题。中共先进队支部早在8月上旬就召开了小队长以上的干部会议，专门研究了细收、收净、收好棉花的措施。支部通过去年第七小队与第二小队在摘花中两种作法两种结果教育社员群众，取得了很好的效果。第七小队去年种棉三百四十多亩，亩产八十六斤。由于全队社员在摘花中努力提高技术，及时摘采，坚持分摘分晒，提高了棉花质量；第二小队种植的棉花亩数、产量与七小队相等，由于收获工作粗糙，降低了棉花质量。结果两个小队出售棉花数量虽然相等，但是第七小队比第二小队多卖了一千四百多元。通过这个事例，使社员深刻认识到，摘好棉、售好棉不仅增加集体收入，更重要的是支援了国家建设。为了抢晴天采摘棉花，各小队都设有专人加强天气预报。例如有一天各队听到有雨的消息后，立即出动一千一百多名劳力突击抢收棉花，使这一天成熟吐絮的二万斤棉花避免了阴雨的危害。
    先进队社员们还推广先进摘棉经验，改进摘棉技术，提高棉花质量。第五小队女社员赵惠芳每天摘一百一十多斤棉花，而且摘的棉花无杂质。赵惠芳的主要经验是：在摘花时，先用左手打棉桃底座的老叶，然后捉住花秆，右手五指捏住五个花瓣摘，摘的既快，又不留睫毛花，还避免碎叶粘在棉絮上。党支部立即组织附近几个小队社员现场学习。第六小队在“学惠芳、超惠芳”的口号下，摘棉进度由原来每人平均日摘四十斤提高到九十斤。接着各小队也都因地、因人树立了自己的标兵，改进摘棉操作技术，全大队已由原来日摘五千斤提高到日摘七千二百斤。
    为了从摘到晒、从晒到售一环套一环，环环都赶上，先进生产队还专门固定了十辆大车、二十九辆架子车和三百七十个背筐等运输工具，做到随摘、随晒、随出售，到目前为止，全队已把二万一千多斤新棉卖给国家。
