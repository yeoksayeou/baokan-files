Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 17th: According to Vientiane Radio, the Phoumi Nosavan group is currently rampantly conscripting soldiers, attempting to expand its military strength and continue its criminal activities of splitting Laos.

The Phoumi Nosavan group is forcing demobilized soldiers and commandos to gather. In Muang Phine alone, more than 100 young people have been captured to serve as cannon fodder. Even former Sam Neua troops and commandos who had been permitted to return home by the Sam Neua regime and command headquarters were seized and forced into military service by the henchmen of the Phoumi Nosavan group when they returned to Xieng Khouang.

According to a commentary broadcast by Vientiane Radio on the 16th, a foreign country intends to help the Phoumi-Vong group establish an army of 200,000 men, including foreign mercenaries, and send these troops to attack the Kingdom government. The commentary condemned this criminal conspiracy and warned the Phoumi-Vong traitorous group that they will end in failure before the people.

Xinhua News Agency, October 16th: Bangkok dispatch: The reactionary Thanom Kittikachorn ruling clique in Thailand, in coordination with U.S. imperialism's interference in Laos' internal affairs, is intensifying its economic blockade against Laos. According to Bangkok newspapers, due to the Thai authorities' blockade of the border between Thailand and Laos, approximately 1,000 tons of goods destined for Laos are currently being unreasonably detained in Bangkok.

The Thai authorities are also using the pretext of "protecting the safety of Thai merchants" to strictly prohibit Thai merchants from trading with Laos. The Thai authorities are also delaying and obstructing negotiations for Laos to purchase rice from Thailand, and openly rejecting applications from oil companies based in Thailand to transport oil to Laos. According to the Thai Daily on October 9th, Thai Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn recently once again threatened Thai merchants not to do business with Laos. He said that the Thai authorities will severely punish merchants who dare to trade with Laos.

It is reported that some Thai officials have repeatedly and publicly clamored for continuing to use the economic blockade to interfere in Laos. Thai Minister of Interior Nai Prapas Charusathien told the press that if the Kingdom government of Laos does not withdraw its troops stationed on the Mekong River bank within Lao territory to prevent attacks by the Savannakhet rebel group and defend Vientiane, then "we must prohibit Thai merchants from going to Laos to do business."

    诺萨万集团大肆抓丁充当炮灰 
    泰国加紧对老挝实行经济封锁
    新华社河内17日电　据万象电台广播，富米·诺萨万集团目前正在大肆抓丁，企图扩大它的军事实力，继续进行分裂老挝的罪恶活动。
    富米·诺萨万集团强迫复员军人、别动队集中起来。仅在芒非一地，就已抓了一百多名青年去为它当炮灰。甚至连得到桑怒政权和指挥部允许还乡的原桑怒军队、别动队，当他们回到川圹的时候，也被富米·诺萨万集团的爪牙抓去当兵。
    另据万象电台16日在一篇述评中揭露，有一个外国打算帮助富米—文翁集团建立拥有二十万人、包括外国雇佣兵的军队，并派这些军队向王国政府进攻。述评谴责了这种罪恶阴谋，并且警告富米—文翁叛国集团，在人民面前它们将以失败告终。
    据新华社16日讯　曼谷消息：泰国乃沙立反动统治集团为了配合美帝国主义干涉老挝内政，正在加紧对老挝实行经济封锁。据曼谷报纸报道，由于泰国当局封锁泰国和老挝之间的边境，目前已有约一千余吨准备运往老挝的货物，被无理地扣留在曼谷。
    泰国当局还借口“保护泰国商人的安全”，严令禁止泰国商人同老挝进行贸易。泰国当局还一味拖延阻挠老挝向泰国购买大米的谈判，并且公开拒绝设在泰国的石油公司所提出的往老挝运石油的申请。据泰国日报10月9日报道，泰国总理乃沙立最近再次恫吓泰国商人不得同老挝做生意。他说，泰国当局将严厉地惩办那些敢于同老挝进行贸易的商人。
    据报道，泰国的一些官方人士也一再公开叫嚷要继续利用经济封锁对老挝进行干涉。泰国内政部长乃巴博·乍鲁沙天向报界发表谈话时就叫嚣说，如果老挝王国政府不撤退为了防止沙湾拿吉叛乱集团的进攻和保卫万象而驻扎在老挝境内湄公河岸的军队，那么，“我们一定要禁止泰国商人前往老挝做生意”。
