Biography of Inejiro Asanuma

　　Inejiro Asanuma, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, who was assassinated by Japanese fascist thugs, was born in Tokyo in 1898. In 1923, he graduated from the Department of Politics at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. During his time at school, he began to participate in the labor movement and joined the early socialist research groups "Builders Alliance" and "Xiaomin Society." After graduating from school, he joined the miners' union and participated in the famous Ashio Copper Mine strike at that time, and was arrested and imprisoned for five months as a result.

　　In 1925, he served as the secretary-general of the Japan Farmers' Party. The following year, he served as a founding member of the Japan Labor-Farmer Party, and later served as a standing central committee member of the National Labor-Farmer Masses Party and the organization minister of the Social Masses Party.

　　After the war, in 1946, he served as a standing central executive committee member and organization minister of the Japan Socialist Party. The following year, he served as secretary-general. After the split of the Japan Socialist Party in 1951, he served as secretary-general of the Right-wing Socialist Party. In October 1955, when the left and right wings of the Socialist Party merged, he resumed his position as secretary-general of the Socialist Party. At the 17th Extraordinary Congress of the Japan Socialist Party in March of this year, he was elected chairman of the Socialist Party.

　　Since 1936, Inejiro Asanuma has been elected as a member of the House of Representatives many times. Prior to this, he was also elected as a member of the Tokyo City Council twice, and served as the vice-chairman of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly.

　　Asanuma is a famous Japanese political activist. Especially in recent years, he has made important contributions in the struggle for Japan's independence, democracy, peace and neutrality, against American imperialism and Japanese reactionaries, and in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship.

　　Asanuma opposes the Japanese government's foreign policy of subordination to the United States. He advocates an independent and autonomous diplomacy. He said that Japan cannot side with one side in the "Cold War," but must pursue a neutral policy in order to ease world tensions.

　　Asanuma has always stood at the forefront of the movement against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." He has participated in all unified actions of the Japanese people against the "Security Treaty." He pointed out that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is an aggressive military alliance. Japan must abolish the Japan-U.S. "security system." He advocates establishing a Far East collective security system based on the conclusion of non-aggression treaties between Japan, China, the Soviet Union, and the United States to replace Japan's military alliance with the United States. He also expressed full support for Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal that countries along the Asian and Pacific coasts sign a peace pact of non-aggression and build the entire region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

　　During his visit to China in March last year, Asanuma pointed out that American imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people. He said that the basic issue in maintaining peace in the Far East is, first and foremost, the withdrawal of American troops from their bases in Okinawa and other parts of Japan, Taiwan of China, South Korea, and the Philippines. On May 24 of this year, when Asanuma sternly refuted the arrogant remarks of the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, MacArthur II, regarding the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people, he once again condemned American imperialism for imposing military needs on Japan, dividing Korea and Vietnam, seizing Taiwan, and occupying Okinawa. He said that this is the essence of American imperialism. He expressed his determination to fight to force the United States to withdraw all American troops and American military bases, including all spy planes.

　　In 1957 and 1959, Asanuma led delegations from the Japan Socialist Party to visit China twice, and issued joint statements with Zhang Xiruo, president of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, twice. These visits played a positive role in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and the normalization of relations between the two countries.

　　During his visit to China in 1959, Asanuma delivered a speech advocating that the Japanese government should recognize the People's Republic of China as soon as possible and establish friendly relations with China. He said that there is only one China, and Taiwan is a part of China. It is only natural for the People's Republic of China to restore its representation in the United Nations.

    浅沼是日本著名的政治活动家。特别是近几年来，他在争取日本的独立、民主、和平中立和反对美帝国主义及日本反动派，以及促进日中友好关系的斗争中，作出了重要的贡献。
    浅沼反对日本政府的从属于美国的外交政策。他主张实行独立自主的外交。他说，日本不能在“冷战”中倒向一方，而必须执行中立政策，以便缓和世界的紧张局势。
    浅沼一直站在反对日美“安全条约”运动的前列，他参加了历次日本人民反对“安全条约”的统一行动。他指出日美“安全条约”是侵略性军事同盟。日本必须废除日美“安全体系”。他主张建立以缔结日、中、苏、美互不侵犯条约为基础的远东集体安全体系来代替日本同美国的军事联盟。他并且表示全面支持周恩来总理关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国签订互不侵犯的和平公约，把整个地区建成为没有核武器的地区的建议。
    浅沼在去年3月来华访问时就指出：美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人。他说，要维护远东和平的基本问题首先是美国从它在冲绳和日本其它部分、中国的台湾、南朝鲜和菲律宾的基地撤退它的军队。在今年5月24日，浅沼在严正驳斥美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二对日本人民的爱国正义斗争的骄横谈话时，再一次谴责美帝国主义把军事需要强加于日本，并且分裂朝鲜和越南，霸占台湾和霸占冲绳。他说这就是美帝国主义的实质。他表示要为迫使美国撤退包括一切间谍飞机在内的所有美军和美军基地而斗争。

    浅沼在1959年访华时发表讲话主张，日本政府应该尽快地承认中华人民共和国，并同中国建立友好关系。他说，中国只有一个，台湾是中国的一部分。中华人民共和国恢复它在联合国的代表权是理所当然的。
