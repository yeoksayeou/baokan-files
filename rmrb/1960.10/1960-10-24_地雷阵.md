    Minefield
    Niè Xūn Cái
    It was the winter of 1951, shortly after we arrived at the Kim Sung front in Korea. I went to the position of the fourth company of a certain unit to understand the situation of the demolition squad fighting tanks. This day at noon, the American devils' tanks moved out again, like a string of turtles, howling and heading towards our position. However, when they reached six or seven hundred meters from our position, they dared not advance any further, stopping to fire blindly. The demolition squad soldiers told me that a month ago, the enemy's tanks were simply man-eating, coming out in droves and rushing to within two hundred meters of our position, firing a barrage at our position. That crazy momentum was truly infuriating. At that time, the American bandits bullied us for not having more air force and anti-tank guns. However, a few days ago, we taught them a lesson with landmines, and now, they don't dare to barge in casually.
    In order to deal with these iron turtles, the demolition squad comrades went to the area between the enemy and us to lay landmines in the freezing winter nights. The ground was as frozen as granite. In front of our soldiers, this was not considered a difficulty. However, digging through the frozen soil under the enemy's nose was not an easy task: digging too hard, the enemy could hear it; digging too lightly, it wouldn't penetrate. The soldiers had to use picks and shovels to dig little by little. Taking advantage of the surrounding artillery fire, they would dig hard a couple of times. They put the dug-up frozen soil into sacks and carried it hundreds of meters away to cover it with snow. In this way, two enemy tanks were blown up. Soldier Chen Wenjian, seeing that the enemy's tanks did not dare to get close to us, said happily: "The enemy doesn't dare to come anymore." At this time, squad leader Zhang Zaiyun corrected him, saying: "It's not that they don't dare to come, but that they are more cunning. The enemy tanks firing blindly are coming to scout out the situation. Only by treating dead turtles as live turtles and paper tigers as iron tigers can we truly defeat their madness." Inspired by the squad leader, the whole squad immediately held a Zhuge Liang meeting. Everyone said that since the enemy is cunning, we will let them walk right into our trap. That night, the soldiers carried landmines out again. They found the enemy tanks' track marks, shoveling up the snow and soil together, then digging holes one by one, placing the landmines in, and then covering them with the snow blocks with the track marks intact, and sweeping away their footprints with branches. Sure enough, before long, the cunning enemy tanks came along their past route. However, they did not expect that they were paving a road to their own death.
    In this freezing and snowy winter, this small demolition squad, with their wisdom and courage, made the enemy's tanks unable to move an inch. If it traveled on the highway, it would be bombed on the highway; if it traveled on the river beach, it would suddenly explode under the sand. If it traveled along the tracks it had previously made, it would break its legs even more accurately. However, these bandit tanks would not give up until they saw the King of Hell, and finally, they came towards us from a small river.
    No matter how cunning the enemy was, it could not save its fate. Under the leadership of Deputy Platoon Leader Tan Jicheng and Squad Leader Zhang Zaiyun, the whole squad held another Zhuge Liang meeting. Everyone said that since we don't have water mines, let's be self-reliant and make our own homemade water mines. Chen Wenjian found two iron boxes for ammunition from the enemy's broken tanks and filled them with explosives. Without sealing glue and wax, they boiled broken rubber shoes into glue to seal the gaps. Using this simple method, they used fried flour boxes, ammunition boxes, etc., to make many homemade water mines, braving the severe cold, smashing the ice, and burying the homemade water mines in the river ditch. Sure enough, these iron turtles found their burial place in the river ditch.
    The next spring arrived, and although the enemy's tanks were not as crazy as before, they still came out to fire artillery frequently. Sometimes, they would even have their artillery bombard the road they were about to pass in a chaotic barrage, trying to detonate the landmines before barging in. The soldiers saw through the enemy's trick and estimated that the enemy was about to retaliate madly against us. Comrade Zhang Zaiyun said to everyone: "It's good that they're retaliating, let them come to our door again, so we can fight a battle of annihilation." So, they sang a "empty city strategy", not burying landmines on the roads or in the rice fields, letting the enemy's shells bombard chaotically for a while. After studying the enemy's activity patterns and discovering the signs that the enemy was about to retaliate, on the evening of February 25th, the whole squad mobilized and laid out more than forty landmines in that rice field, forming "plum blossom formations," "triangular formations," and "serpentine formations," waiting for the enemy to come and dig their own graves.
    The next day, as the thin mist just dissipated, sixteen enemy tanks, full of momentum, drove in. When these iron turtles "safely" drove into this rice field, thinking that there were no problems, they began to deploy their formation. However, the bandits were happy too soon. In the rice field, along with the movement of the iron turtles, there were earth-shattering explosions. Two tanks were blown up and caught fire. The bandits were in a dilemma in the minefield, with sand, shrapnel, and thick smoke accompanied by death, tightly enveloping this pile of bandit's steel turtles. Some of the devils turned their tanks and fled in embarrassment; others opened the lids and fled for their lives. At this time, the artillery group at our position roared angrily. In this graveyard carefully set up by the volunteer soldiers, in the sound of our army's "salute", six enemy tanks and piles of devil corpses were buried. …

    地雷阵
    聂勋材
    那是1951年的冬天，我们刚到朝鲜金城前线不久，我到某部四连的阵地上去了解爆破班打坦克的情况。这天中午，美国鬼子的坦克又出动了，像一串串乌龟似的，嚎叫着向我们的阵地开来。可是，到离我们阵地六、七百米的地方，它们就不敢再前进了，停下来盲目地打炮。爆破班的战士们对我说，一个月以前，敌人的坦克简直像要吃人似的，一出来就是一窝蜂，闯到我们阵地前两百米左右的地方，对准我们阵地，就是一阵炮击，那股疯狂劲，看了真叫人气愤。那时，美国强盗欺侮我们没有更多的空军和反坦克炮。可是，前几天，我们用地雷教训了它一顿，现在，它就不敢随便闯进来了。
    爆破班的同志们为了对付这些铁王八，在数九寒天的夜里，到敌我之间的地带去埋地雷。地呀，冻得像花岗岩一样。在我们战士面前，这本来算不了什么困难。但是，要在敌人的鼻子下挖开冻土，却不是容易的事：挖重了，敌人听得见；挖轻了，挖不进去。战士们只好用镐和锹一点一点地刨。趁着周围炮声响起时，狠狠地挖它两下。他们把挖出来的冻土，用麻袋装好，背到几百米处去用雪掩盖起来。就这样，炸着了敌人两辆坦克。战士陈文建看着敌人的坦克不敢开近我们，便高兴地说：“敌人不敢来了。”这时，班长张再云同志纠正着他的话说：“它不是不敢来，而是更狡猾了。敌人坦克出来盲目地打炮，是侦察情况来的。只有把死王八当成活王八打，把纸老虎当成铁老虎打，才能真正打掉它的疯狂劲。”在班长的启发下，全班为了对付这个狡猾的敌人，立即开了个诸葛亮会。大家说，敌人狡猾，我们就让它自投罗网。这天晚上，战士们又背着地雷出去了。他们找到了敌人坦克的履带印，把它连雪带土地铲起来，然后刨开一个个的洞，放进地雷后，再把有履带印的雪块原封不动地盖上，用树枝把自己的脚印扫掉。果然，没有多久，狡猾的敌人坦克，沿着它过去的道路开来。可是，它却没有想到，它自己为自己开辟了一条通向死亡的道路。
    在这个冰天雪地的严冬里，这个小小的爆破班，就凭他们的智慧和勇敢，把敌人的坦克制得寸步难行。它走公路，在公路上挨炸；它走河滩，沙滩底下又会突然爆炸；它沿着走过的履带印走，又会更准地炸断它的腿。可是，这些强盗坦克，不见阎王心不死，最后，竟从小河里向我们开来。
    敌人再诡，也挽救不了它的命运。全班在副排长谭际成和班长张再云的领导下，又开了个诸葛亮会。大家说，我们没有水雷，就来个自力更生，自造土水雷。陈文建从敌人的破坦克里找出两个装子弹的铁箱子，把炸药装进去。没有密封的胶和蜡，他们用破胶鞋熬成胶水，封住缝隙。就用这个土办法，用炒面箱、子弹箱等，制成了很多土水雷，冒着严寒，砸开冰块，把土造水雷埋到河沟里。果然，这些铁王八，又在河沟里找到了它的葬身之地。
    第二年的春天到了，敌人的坦克虽然没有过去那么疯狂，可是，还是经常出来打炮，有时，甚至先让它的炮兵向它要经过的道路上乱轰一阵，想把地雷诱发后，再闯进来。战士们看穿了敌人的诡计，估计敌人要疯狂地报复我们。张再云同志对大家说：“它来报复也好，让它再送上门来，我们好打个歼灭仗。”于是，他们就唱了个“空城计”，路上、稻田里都不埋地雷，让敌人的炮弹乱轰一阵。大家研究了敌人的活动规律，发现敌人就要报复的征候以后，2月25日晚上，全班出动，就在那片稻田里，把四十多个地雷，摆成了“梅花阵”、“三角阵”、“蛇形阵”，专等敌人来自掘坟墓了。
    第二天，薄雾刚散，敌人十六辆坦克，气势汹汹地开来了。当这些铁王八“平安”地开到这块稻田时，以为没有问题了，就开始摆开阵势。可是，强盗们高兴太早了。稻田里，随着铁王八的蠕动，响起了惊天动地的爆炸声。有两辆坦克被炸得燃起了大火。强盗们在地雷阵里进退维谷，沙石、弹片、浓烟伴随着死神，紧紧地笼罩着这堆强盗的钢铁王八。鬼子们有的转动着坦克狼狈地逃跑；有的揭开盖子往外逃命。这时，我阵地上的炮群怒吼了。在这个志愿军战士精心设置的坟场里，在我军的“礼炮”声中，埋葬了六辆敌人的坦克，和一堆堆的鬼子尸体。……
