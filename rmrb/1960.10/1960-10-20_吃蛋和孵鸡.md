Eating Eggs and Hatching Chickens

"Is it better to eat an egg, or save it to hatch a chick?" This is a vivid analogy made by Gao Qinglian, a labor model from Liaoning Province. He meant that in developing production, we should pay attention to accumulation and concentrate funds as much as possible on expanding reproduction, and never consume them casually. This analogy captures the essence of running a commune diligently and frugally, and it is indeed worth pondering.

Diligence and frugality are the foundation of any enterprise. Today, in the countryside, we advocate running communes and managing households diligently and frugally, so as to fully utilize existing human, material, and financial resources, expand production avenues as much as possible, reduce consumption and waste, in order to focus on building collective family assets and create conditions for further improving living standards. Therefore, every penny is useful to us. Those who manage the commune should learn to be careful and precise in their calculations, and be good at making limited funds create greater construction results. Some people have a harmful idea, thinking: "The commune is big and has a large estate, it doesn't matter if a little bit is wasted." A little bit may be small, but waste is still waste. If this little bit is saved and properly allocated, then this little bit will become an immeasurable huge wealth. The way of spending money is like using soldiers. If you know how to use it, one can be as good as ten, but if you don't know how to use it, ten are not as good as one. Those who are good at running the commune diligently and frugally can not only save, but also allocate effectively, and can invest the saved money in the urgent needs of production, turning it into hundreds of millions.

"Keep the big picture in mind, and start with small things," there are also tricks to being diligent and frugal. Chairman Mao once pointed out in the editor's note to the article "The Secretary Takes the Lead, the Whole Party Runs the Commune" about Wang Guofan's commune in Zunhua County, Hebei: "I think this is the image of our entire country. Can't 600 million poor people, through their own efforts, become a socialist country that is both rich and strong in a few decades?" Relying on the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and relying on our own hard work, we can definitely quickly change the face of "poverty and blankness." We must have such great ambitions, be conscientious and diligent, and not relax our efforts, even in the slightest.

### 吃蛋和孵鸡

    吃蛋和孵鸡
    “是吃一个鸡蛋好呢，还是留着孵一只小鸡好？”这是辽宁省劳动模范高清连做的一个形象的比喻。他的意思是说，在发展生产中，应当注意积累，尽可能将资金集中用到扩大再生产上，千万不要随便消耗掉。这个比喻道着了勤俭办社的精髓，确实值得人们深思。
    勤俭是立业之本。我们今天在农村中提倡勤俭办社、勤俭持家，就是为了充分运用现有的人力、物力、财力，尽量扩大生产门路，减少消耗浪费，以便集中建设集体的家业，为进一步改善生活创造条件。因此，每一分钱，对我们都是有用的。管理公社的人应该学会精打细算，善于使有限的资金创造出更大的建设成果。有些人有一种有害的思想，认为：“公社家大业大，浪费个一星半点没有啥。”一星半点固然是少，可是浪费终究是浪费。假若把这一星半点节省下来，并且支配得当，那么这一星半点会变成不可估量的巨大财富。花钱之道和用兵一样，会用则以一当十，不会用则十不当一，善于勤俭办社的人不仅能省，而且调度有方，能把省下来的钱，投到生产急需上去，使之化为千百万亿。
    “大处着眼、小处着手”，讲究勤俭也有其窍门。毛主席在河北遵化县王国藩社“书记动手，全党办社”一文的按语中曾经指出：“我看这就是我们整个国家的形象。难道六万万穷棒子不能在几十年内，由于自己的努力，变成一个社会主义的又富又强的国家吗？”我们依靠党和毛主席的英明领导，依靠自己的辛勤努力，一定可以迅速改变“一穷二白”的面貌。我们要有这样的雄心大志，要兢兢业业，克勤克俭，不放松一点一滴的努力。
