Zhengzhou, This paper reported on the 23rd. Yanshi County, Henan Province, correctly handled the relationship between high-yield plots and general fields in this year's wheat sowing work. It not only focused on high-yield plots, but also focused on general fields. At the same time, it focused on weak links in all aspects - grabbing "dead-end land" in general fields and third-class seedlings in high-yield plots, so that the quality of autumn sowing in the county was greatly improved, laying a solid foundation for comprehensive and balanced production increase next summer.

After communization, Yanshi County gave full play to the superiority of the people's communes, vigorously developed high-yield wheat plots, and earnestly implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production, which significantly increased the unit yield of grain and provided more systematic experience in increasing production of large-scale grain crops. However, the growth of unit yields in various regions of the county is very uneven. Not only is there a significant difference between high-yield plots and general fields; even within a general field or a high-yield plot in one area, there are differences in yield. Judging from the stationing of more than 510,000 mu of grain crops this summer, the average yield per mu of the 200,000 mu of high-yield plots is more than double that of the 310,000 mu of general fields. Among them, the yield of more than 50,000 mu of so-called "dead-end land" is even lower, with an average of less than 100 jin per mu. The reason for the wide disparity in yield is mainly the unbalanced use of leadership, labor, fertilizer, seeds, and tools. Land near the village, flat land, land that leaders often visit, strong labor allocation, good water conservancy conditions, more fertilizer, and very careful management; land far away, barren land, remote land, and land that leaders rarely visit are poorly equipped with labor, fertilizer, seeds, and tools.

Before the autumn sowing this year, the Yanshi County Committee of the Communist Party of China earnestly summed up the experience of increasing wheat production over the years and checked the existing problems. It was believed that to realize the continuous leap forward in grain production, while vigorously grasping high-yield plots, vigorously grasping general fields, and vigorously grasping weak links in all aspects, tapping potential from weak links to achieve large-scale balanced production increase is the key for the county to strive for a higher level of wheat production. To this end, the Yanshi County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in arranging this year's autumn sowing work, regarded grasping balanced production increase and grasping weak links as the primary issues, and made specific arrangements from all aspects such as leadership and labor. The first is to increase troops and strengthen the front line of production. In addition to the standing committee members of the county party committee and the secretaries of the commune party committee who are responsible for different areas, 72 strong leading cadres were drawn from the transferred cadres to serve as branch secretaries and captains in 24 backward production teams and 305 backward areas to ensure a change in the face of low production. In line with this spirit, various communes re-deployed labor and machinery, and rationally allocated fertilizer and seeds, to ensure that high-yield plots would move towards higher standards, and that general fields and "dead-end land" would be "turned over."

In order to set examples in different soil types and different regions, leaders at all levels have both high-yield model fields and model fields that turn low-yield into high-yield. The county has established more than 22,000 mu of different types of model fields in plains, slopes, ditches, and ridges.

Yanshi County's practice of vigorously grasping general fields while vigorously grasping high-yield plots and grasping weak links makes this year's wheat sowing work vigorous and solid, and the autumn sowing quality of both high-yield plots and general fields has greatly exceeded that of previous years. The county's large-scale high-yield plots have increased from 200,000 mu last year to 300,000 mu, accounting for more than 57% of the total wheat sowing area; compared with last year, the depth of the cultivated layer has increased by an average of about 3 inches, the base fertilizer has increased by more than 2,000 jin, and some land has also been treated with "666" powder for soil treatment.

The changes in general fields and "dead-end land" are even more significant. In the past, many of the more than 21,000 mu of low-yield fields in Laocheng Commune were "randomly planted and harvested." This year, after strengthening the leadership of these fields, the amount of sowing has increased rapidly. Judging from the more than 16,000 mu that have been sown, shallow plowing has generally been changed to deep plowing, with a cultivated layer of more than 5 inches; "vegetarian land" has been changed to fertilized land, with an average of about 3,000 jin per mu; late planting has been changed to timely early planting, an average of 7 days earlier than last year; sparse planting has been changed to rational close planting, with an average of 3 jin more seeds sown than last year.

In this year's wheat sowing work, Yanshi County also solved the problems of unreasonable land use and land waste, and improved land utilization. Due to the fact that more autumn vegetables were planted this year than in any previous year, coupled with the inappropriate over-occupation of good fields by organs, schools, factories, and mines, the wheat sowing area appeared very tight. In order to ensure sufficient wheat planting and invest more good land into high-yield wheat plots, on the one hand, the commune members were mobilized to vigorously engage in intercropping of wheat and vegetables; on the other hand, various organs, schools, factories, and mines were mobilized to stop the infrastructure construction that should be stopped, and to make full use of the front and back of the houses and other small plots of vacant land to grow vegetables, so as to free up good land for the teams to plant wheat. At present, the county has intercropped more than 36,000 mu of wheat and vegetables, and after checking them plot by plot and field by field, 2,380 mu of good land has been vacated from the county, commune, and various organs, schools, factories, and mines for wheat planting. Under the slogan of competing for every inch of land and striving to plant more, each production team also re-used some of the so-called "wait-for-rain" land that had been abandoned and was about to be abandoned. Shanquan Brigade of Dakou Commune reused 1,200 mu, and Dongcun Brigade reused 1,000 mu.

### 提高丰产方　促进一般田　铲除“死角地”  偃师力争小麦生产更上一层楼  秋播质量大大提高，为明年夏粮均衡增产打下基础

    提高丰产方　促进一般田　铲除“死角地”
    偃师力争小麦生产更上一层楼
    秋播质量大大提高，为明年夏粮均衡增产打下基础
    本报郑州23日电　河南省偃师县在今年麦播工作中，正确处理了丰产方和一般田的关系，既大抓丰产方，又狠抓一般田，同时又着重抓各方面薄弱环节——在一般田内抓“死角地”，在丰产方内抓三类苗，使得全县秋播质量大大提高，为明年夏季全面平衡增产，扎扎实实的打下了基础。
    公社化后，偃师县充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，大搞小麦丰产方，切实贯彻执行了农业生产“八字宪法”，使粮食单位产量有显著提高，为大面积粮食作物生产提供了比较系统的增产经验。但是全县各个地区单位产量的增长却很不平衡。不仅丰产方和一般田有显著的差别；即在一个地区的一般田或一个丰产方内，产量高低也有不同。据今年夏收五十一万余亩粮食作物的站队情况来看，二十万亩丰产方和三十一万余亩一般田，单产平均相差一倍以上。其中五万余亩所谓
  “死角地”，产量更低，平均每亩还不足一百斤。形成产量悬殊的原因，主要是领导、劳力、肥料、种子、工具等使用的很不平衡。近地、平地、领导常去的地，劳力搭配的强，水利条件好，肥料上得多，管理很认真；远地、薄地、背地和领导少去的地，劳力、肥料、种子、工具，样样都配备的很差。
    今年秋播前，中共偃师县委认真总结了历年来小麦增产经验和检查了存在问题，认为要实现粮食生产的持续跃进，在大抓丰产方的同时，大抓一般田，并狠抓各方面的薄弱环节，从薄弱环节中大挖潜力，达到大面积平衡增产，是这个县争取小麦生产更上一层楼的关键。为此，中共偃师县委在安排今年秋播工作中，把抓平衡增产，抓薄弱环节当作首要问题，并从领导、劳力等各方面进行了具体安排。首先是增兵添将，加强生产第一线。除县委常委和公社党委书记分片包干外，又在下放干部中抽出七十二名强有力的领导骨干，到二十四个生产落后队和三百零五个落后片，担任支书、队长，保证改变低产面貌。各个公社又根据这个精神，重新部署劳力、机械，合理分配肥料、种子，保证既要使丰产方向更高标准迈进，又要使一般田和“死角地”来个“翻身”。
    为了在不同土质、不同地区树立榜样，各级领导干部都一手搞高额丰产样板田，一手搞变低产为高产的样板田。全县已分别在川、坡、沟、岭建立了二万二千多亩不同类型的样板田。
    偃师县在大抓丰产方的同时，大抓一般田，狠抓薄弱环节的做法，使今年麦播工作进行的既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实，丰产方和一般田的秋播质量都大大超过往年。全县大面积丰产方由去年二十万亩发展到三十万亩，占麦播总面积57％以上；播种质量和去年比较，耕层深度平均提高三寸左右，底肥增加二千多斤，一部分地还用“六六六”粉进行了土壤处理。
    一般田和“死角地”变化更显著。老城公社二万一千多亩低产田，过去有很多是“胡种胡收”，今年在加强对这些田的领导以后，播种量迅速提高。从已经播种的一万六千多亩来看，一般都变浅耕为深耕，耕层超过五寸；变“斋公地”为施肥地，每亩平均三千斤左右；变晚种为适时早种，平均比去年提前七天；变稀植为合理密植，比去年下种量平均多三斤左右。
    偃师县今年在麦播工作中，还解决了使用土地不合理和浪费土地问题，提高了土地利用率。全县由于秋菜比以往任何一年种的都多，加上机关、学校、厂矿不适当的多占大队好田好地，使麦播面积显得很紧张。为保证小麦种足，把更多的好地投入小麦丰产方，一方面发动社员大搞麦菜套种；一方面动员各机关、学校、厂矿，把应当停下来的基建停下来，并尽量利用本单位屋前房后和其它小片空地种菜，以便腾出好地交给各队种麦。目前，全县麦菜套种的已达三万六千多亩，经过逐块、逐场检查，从县、社各机关、学校、厂矿腾出来种麦的好地达二千三百八十多亩。在寸土必争，力争多种的口号下，各生产队还起用了一部分已经废弃和准备废弃的所谓“望天收”的地。大口公社山泉大队就起用一千二百亩，东村大队就起用一千亩。
