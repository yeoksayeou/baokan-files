Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang. A million workers from factories, government offices, and urban people's communes in Shenyang have recently gone to various counties and districts throughout the city to support the autumn harvest.

This year's autumn harvest in the Shenyang area is characterized by: tight schedule, heavy tasks, and a large demand for labor. Based on the above situation, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in addition to concentrating rural labor for the autumn harvest, called on factories, government offices, and urban people's communes throughout the city to organize personnel to go to the countryside to support the autumn harvest. The call of the Municipal Party Committee was immediately met with enthusiastic response from the broad masses of urban people. All systems and units took urgent action to actively organize teams to support the autumn harvest. In order to ensure a complete victory in the autumn harvest, leading cadres of various units personally took command on the front line. The Municipal People's Committee transferred more than 20 bureau chiefs and section chiefs to serve as commanders of the army supporting the autumn harvest.

The mobilization of a million-strong army to support the autumn harvest in Shenyang City was carried out on the basis of vigorously publicizing the idea that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and that vigorously developing agriculture and grain production is taking root in people's hearts. Before departure, all systems and units also made full ideological mobilization, detailed organizational work, and material preparations. The Municipal People's Committee prepared 3,000 sickles in advance so that every cadre going to the countryside would have one. In order to ensure that the support army arrived at the forefront of the autumn harvest on time, the municipal railway transportation department also established a temporary support agriculture headquarters to properly arrange vehicles and set up two ticket sales and transportation teams specifically responsible for transporting personnel supporting the autumn harvest.

The vast numbers of cadres, workers, and masses who went to the countryside to support the autumn harvest also widely carried out labor competitions with the content of speed and quality. This not only accelerated the progress of the autumn harvest but also improved the quality of the autumn harvest, achieving good and careful harvesting, without losing a single grain. Many cadres, workers, and masses, while actively participating in labor, also used their rest time to help commune members carry water, sweep courtyards, wash vegetables, and do other work, and used forms such as reading newspapers and giving speeches to publicize the Party's policies. These have greatly encouraged the broad masses of peasants.

Organizing large numbers of urban workers to go to the countryside to support agriculture during the busy farming season has become a system in Shenyang City. As early as the spring plowing and summer hoeing seasons this year, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China had mobilized hundreds of thousands of people to go to the countryside to provide support, which not only strongly supported agricultural production but also achieved great results in cultivating and training cadres.

This newspaper reports: Under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, factories, mines, government offices, schools, troops, and urban people's communes in Beijing have sent a 70,000-strong voluntary labor army to the forefront of the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting in the suburbs from September 15th to the present, to cooperate with the commune members in the suburbs to rush to harvest autumn grain and autumn vegetables, and to take advantage of the moisture to plant wheat. The first batch of voluntary labor army has returned with honor, and the second batch is successively heading to the suburbs.

These labor armies supporting agriculture are full of energy and high morale on the agricultural production front. Female workers from factories in the Qianmen People's Commune who were sent to the Shiba Li Dian support team from the Chaoyang People's Commune launched a "class package area, person package ridge" class red flag competition. Sixty-two people harvested a total of 48 mu of corn and beans, overfulfilling the task. Two hundred and one workers from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company who supported the "Three Autumns" in the Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune in late September completed the task of harvesting, harrowing, and repairing canals, which was originally planned to be completed in half a month, in only nine days. The personnel supporting the autumn harvest also paid attention to careful harvesting and threshing, ensuring that every grain was stored in the barn. Ninety-two government cadres who worked in the Machang No. 2 team of the Huangtugang Sino-Hungarian Friendship People's Commune cleaned up the wheat grains that had fallen on the ground; the corn kernels that had not been picked up in the field were also picked up.

The broad masses of workers, cadres, and university students also used their rest time to publicize current affairs and policies, help the commune canteen carry water and wash vegetables, and help commune members clean up. The militia of the No. 1 branch of the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory, who worked in the Heping People's Commune, put forward the slogan of "three lights and one full" (the inside of the house, the outside of the house, and the streets are cleaned brightly, and the water tank is filled with water), and prepared hot water for the commune members to wash their feet and drive away mosquitoes. This batch of voluntary labor army not only supported the "Three Autumns" production but also further strengthened the friendship between workers and peasants and the relationship between urban and rural areas.

    沈阳北京大批城市职工奔赴郊区
    参加义务劳动  支援公社秋收
    据新华社沈阳电　沈阳市各工厂、机关和城市人民公社最近有一百万人分赴全市各县、区支援秋收。
    今年沈阳地区秋收工作的特点是：时间紧，任务重，用工量大。中共沈阳市委根据上述情况，除了集中农村劳力进行秋收以外，就号召全市各工厂、机关和城市人民公社组织人员下乡支援秋收。市委的号召，立即得到广大城市人民的热烈响应，各系统各单位都紧急地行动起来，积极组织支援秋收的队伍。为了保证秋收全胜，各单位的领导干部都亲自挂帅上前线。市人委抽调二十多名局长和处长，担任支援秋收大军的指挥员。
    沈阳市这次组织百万大军支援秋收，是在大张旗鼓宣传农业是国民经济的基础，大办农业、大办粮食的思想日益深入人心的基础上进行的。在出发之前，各系统各单位又都作了充分的思想发动和细致的组织工作以及物资上的准备。市人委提前准备了三千把镰刀，做到下乡的干部每人都有一把。为了保证支援大军按时到达秋收第一线，市铁路运输部门，还成立了临时支援农业的指挥部，妥善安排了车辆，并设立了两个售票、运输小组，专门负责运送支援秋收的人员。
    下乡支援秋收的广大干部和职工群众，在秋收中还广泛开展了以快、好为内容的劳动竞赛，这不仅加快了秋收进度，而且提高了秋收质量，做到了收得好，收得细，颗粒不丢。很多干部和职工群众，在积极参加劳动的同时，还利用休息时间，帮助社员挑水、扫院、洗菜和做其它工作，并运用读报、讲演等形式宣传党的政策。这些，对广大农民群众起了极大的鼓舞作用。
    组织大批城市职工在农忙时下乡支援，在沈阳市已经形成一种制度。早在今年春耕、夏锄时期，中共沈阳市委就曾先后动员几十万人下乡支援，这不仅有力地支援了农业生产，同时在培养和锻炼干部方面也收到了巨大的效果。
    本报讯　北京市厂矿、机关、学校、部队和城市人民公社在市委的统一领导下，自9月15日到现在，已经派出七万人义务劳动大军，开赴郊区秋收、秋耕、秋种第一线，协同郊区公社社员抢收秋粮、秋菜，趁墒种麦。第一批义务劳动大军已经载誉归来，第二批正陆续开赴郊区。
    这些支援农业的劳动大军在农业生产前线干劲十足，斗志昂扬。前门人民公社各工厂派到朝阳人民公社十八里店支援“三秋”的女职工，开展了“班包片、人包垅”的班组红旗竞赛，六十二个人共收割玉米和豆子四十八亩，超额完成了任务。9月下旬在中苏友好人民公社支援“三秋”的石景山钢铁公司的二百零一名职工，仅用九天的时间就完成了原计划用半个月完成的收割、耙地和修渠任务。支援秋收的人员还注意精收细打，颗粒归仓。在黄土岗中匈友好人民公社马场二队劳动的九十二名机关干部，把掉在地里的麦粒都收拾得干干净净；场院上没有拣净的玉米粒，也都拾起来。
    广大职工、干部和高等学校学生还利用休息时间宣传时事政策，帮助公社食堂挑水、洗菜，帮助社员打扫卫生。在和平人民公社劳动的北京汽车修配厂第一分厂的民兵，提出“三光一满”（屋里、屋外、街道打扫得光光亮亮，水缸里把水打满）的口号，并为社员准备洗脚热水，轰赶蚊子。这批义务劳动大军既支援了“三秋”生产，又进一步密切了工农友谊和城乡关系。（附图片）
