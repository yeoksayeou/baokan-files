    "Raw" and "Ripe"
    Wang Shanjing, Worker of Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory

    When people start a task, they often feel it is "raw" or unfamiliar; however, after a period of practice and exploration, they will feel "ripe" or familiar. "Raw" and "ripe" reflect different stages in people's understanding of the development of objective things. The so-called "raw" means that people temporarily do not understand the nature and regularity of a certain objective thing. The so-called "ripe" means that people, through continuous practice, have accumulated experience and gradually grasped the laws of the development of things, so that they can carry out practical activities more effectively.

    "Raw" and "ripe" are a unity of opposites. When the two sides of a contradiction develop to a certain condition, they will transform into each other. "Raw" can be transformed into "ripe"; "ripe" can also be transformed into "raw" again. This constant alternating evolution marks the progressive development of people's understanding from low to high, and from shallow to deep. When a person does not understand the performance of machines and production technology, he will certainly be unable to start production. However, this phenomenon is only temporary and can be changed. As long as he personally participates in production practice activities and fully exerts his subjective initiative, he will gradually change from "raw" to "ripe," and from a layman to a skilled technician.

    However, everything is developing and changing. With the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and the continuous emergence of new technologies, even skilled workers sometimes encounter unfamiliar things in their work. That is to say, "ripe" is transformed into "raw" again. To transform from "raw" to "ripe" again, people need to quickly learn new technologies and new processes, and consciously accelerate the transformation process from "raw" to "ripe." Looking at the automated production lines, single-machine automation, and semi-automation innovation projects implemented in our factory, all have gone through the process from "raw" to "ripe." The thread grinding machine, once regarded as a "Buddha's eye," has, after breaking the superstitious idea of ​​the "reaching the top theory" and overcoming various difficulties, found the reasons from each failure, gradually mastered the law of realizing single-machine automation, and finally realized single-machine automation. "One day equals twenty years" is a good description of the era we are currently in. Such an era puts forward a common requirement to people, that is, to keep up with the development of the situation, adapt to the requirements of the development of the situation, and make the mind change with the changes of objective things. Only in this way can we meet the requirements of socialist construction.

    However, some people, because they have not clarified the dialectical relationship between "raw" and "ripe," always feel unaccustomed and unable to handle things smoothly whenever a new thing appears in their work or when an advanced experience is to be promoted. At this time, they try to avoid difficulties and still push the cart on a familiar road. Obviously, this attitude is incorrect. They do not understand that it is inevitable for people to feel "raw" when they first come into contact with a new technology, but this is only a temporary phenomenon. As long as efforts are made, "raw" will gradually transform into "ripe," thereby promoting the development of things. If we always stick to the old methods, it will hinder the development of things. Therefore, we should take a warm and welcoming attitude towards the promotion of any new technology or new experience, and actively support and help it, so that it can continuously improve, grow, and develop. Revolutionaries clearly understand that the creation of any new technology and the promotion of new experiences will take our country's economic construction a step forward. Therefore, we should not be timid in the face of new things, but should try every means to overcome all difficulties, master them, and use them to benefit society. This will promote the continuous development of things.

    Marxists are not only continuous revolutionaries, but also revolutionaries with stages. In production technology, it is necessary to continuously innovate, promote, and learn new experiences; and after each successful innovation, a stage of consolidation and promotion is needed, and then further development is carried out on this basis. This process is the development process of things from "raw" to "ripe," and then from "ripe" to "raw," and also the development process of things from a low-level stage to a high-level stage. Because in the process of consolidating and promoting new technologies, new "raw" and new innovations are already brewing. Therefore, our thinking must conform to such an objective law of development, fully understand and master the dialectics of "raw" and "ripe," so as to play a greater role in the cause of socialist construction and make ourselves a revolutionary promoter.

### “生”和“熟”

    “生”和“熟”
    哈尔滨第一工具厂工人　王善敬
    人们开始作一件工作时，往往感到“生”；可是，经过一段实践摸索的过程，就会感到“熟”了。“生”和“熟”反映了人认识客观事物发展的不同阶段。所谓“生”，就是人们暂时还不了解某一客观事物的性质和规律性。所谓“熟”，就是人们经过不断地实践，积累了经验，逐步地掌握了事物的发展规律，从而能够更有成效地进行实践活动。
    “生”和“熟”是矛盾的统一。矛盾的双方发展到一定的条件下，就会互相转化。“生”可以转化为
  “熟”；“熟”也可以再转化为“生”。这样不断地交替演变，标志着人们的认识由低级到高级、由浅入深地向前发展。当一个人不懂机器的性能和生产技术的时候，他想从事生产就一定无从下手。但是，这种现象只是暂时的，是可以改变的。只要他亲身参加生产实践活动，充分发挥主观能动作用，就会逐步地由“生”到“熟”，由原来是门外汉变成为熟练的技术工人。
    可是，一切事物都是发展变化的。随着技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，新技术的不断涌现，就是熟练工人有时也会在工作中遇到生疏事情。也就是说，“熟”又转化为“生”了。要想再由“生”到“熟”，就需要人们很快地学会新技术和新工艺，自觉地加速由“生”到“熟”的转化过程。从我厂所实现的自动化生产线、单机自动化和半自动化等革新项目来看，无不经过由“生”到“熟”的过程。曾经被人们认为是“佛爷眼珠”的螺纹磨床，经过破除了“到顶论”的迷信思想，克服了种种困难，从每一次的失败中找出原因，逐步地掌握了实现单机自动化的规律，终于实现了单机自动化。“一天等于二十年”，这是对我们目前所处的时代很好的说明。这样的时代，向人们提出了一个共同的要求，这就是要跟上形势的发展，适应形势发展的要求，使思想跟着客观事物的变化而变化。只有这样作才符合社会主义建设事业的要求。
    但是，有的人由于没有弄清“生”和“熟”的辩证关系，每当工作中出现一种新生事物或要推广一项先进经验时，总感到不习惯，不能得心应手，这时，他们就企图避开困难，仍然推着轻车走熟路。很显然，这种态度是不正确的。他们不了解，人们在初接触一种新的技术时，感到“生”是必然的，但这只是暂时的现象。只要经过努力，“生”就会逐步转化为“熟”，从而促进事物的发展。如果我们总是抱着老办法不放，就会阻碍事物的发展。因此，我们对任何一项新技术、新经验的推广，都应该抱着热情欢迎的态度，积极地支持它、帮助它，使它不断地完善和成长发展。革命者清楚地了解，任何一项新技术的创造，新经验的推广，都会使我国的经济建设向前迈进一步。所以我们在新生事物面前不是畏缩，而是应该想尽一切办法，克服一切困难，掌握它、运用它为社会造福。这样才会促进事物不断地向前发展。
    马克思主义者不仅是不断革命论者，而且又是革命的阶段论者。在生产技术上需要不断地革新、推广和学习新的经验；而每一次革新成功之后，又需要一个巩固和推广的阶段，然后在这个基础上进一步发展。这个过程，就是事物由“生”到“熟”，再由“熟”到“生”的发展过程，也是事物由低级阶段向高级阶段的发展过程。因为在新技术的巩固和推广的过程中，就已经孕育着新的“生”和新的革新。所以，我们的思想必须符合这样一个客观发展的规律，充分认识和掌握“生”和“熟”的辩证法，从而在社会主义的建设事业中发挥更大的作用，使自己成为一个革命的促进派。
