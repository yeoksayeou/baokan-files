(Our newspaper Changsha, October 27th) Hunan Province is vigorously developing folk transportation tools according to local conditions, which has effectively solved the contradiction of large transportation volume and insufficient transportation capacity brought about by the sustained and comprehensive leap forward in current industrial and agricultural production. From January to September this year, the province built more than 100,000 tons of new wooden sailing ships and added more than 92,000 animal-drawn carts. These folk transportation tools have exerted tremendous power on the province's transportation front. In September alone, the transportation volume completed by wooden sailing ships was one and a half times the total monthly transportation volume of trains, highways, and ships in the province.

Hunan Province has a network of rivers, with 70% of its counties and communes accessible to sailing ships. In addition, in recent years, various places have vigorously dredged rivers and built a large number of reservoir and canal projects, creating new conditions for the development of water transportation. At the same time, Hunan has a large number of oxen, and the service period of these oxen is generally only three to four months each year. Making full use of agricultural gaps to develop oxcart transportation is also very promising. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed these favorable conditions and repeatedly instructed various localities to vigorously mobilize the masses, build vehicles and ships in a manner appropriate to local conditions, vigorously carry out technological innovation, and actively develop folk transportation tools. Since June this year, Party committees at all levels, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, have organized all walks of life to launch a mass movement to build vehicles and ships throughout the province. Dao County, located in the mountainous area of southern Hunan, has promoted more than 6,000 animal-drawn carts and more than 8,000 tons of wooden sailing ships in recent years. All people's communes and production brigades have ensured that every team has access to animal-drawn carts, and all river ports and canals have access to wooden sailing ships. Since last year, the county has not requested automobile transportation from above, but the county's industrial and agricultural production and daily necessities have not been backlogged. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all parts of the province to launch a mass movement to "learn from Dao County and catch up with Dao County," which has powerfully promoted the popularization and use of folk transportation tools throughout the province.

While building vehicles and ships on a large scale, all localities have attached great importance to mobilizing the masses to vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, and fully tap the potential of folk transportation tools. The staff and workers of the wooden sailing ship transportation department carried out a technological innovation movement centered on "increasing buoyancy, increasing load capacity, and increasing sailing speed." At present, about 70% of the wooden sailing ships in the province have promoted advanced transportation experiences such as two ships helping each other, wooden ships towing, light and heavy load distribution, and light stripping to increase buoyancy, increasing the carrying capacity of a single ship by 30% to one time. In addition, about 30% of the wooden sailing ships in the province have promoted the advanced transportation experience of "eight-sided wind," using wind power to propel the ship and accelerate the sailing speed. The staff and workers of the animal-drawn cart transportation department have launched a competition movement centered on four modernizations (sailing, train-like, four-wheeled, and semi-automatic loading) and "eight reforms" (changing double wheels to four wheels, changing heavy car bodies to light car bodies, changing single cars to trailers, changing animal power to wind-assisted travel, changing single axles to double axles, changing concave car boxes to flat boxes, changing fixed wheels to turntable wheels, changing two people driving one car to one person driving multiple cars), fully tapping the transportation potential of animal-drawn carts.

    湖南大力发展民间运输工具
    今年头九个月全省新造木帆船十万多吨，牛马车九万二千多部
    本报长沙27日电　湖南省因地制宜大力发展民间运输工具，有力地解决了当前工农业生产持续全面跃进带来的运输量大、运力不足的矛盾。今年1至9月份，全省共新造木帆船十万多吨，新增加牛马车九万二千多部。这些民间运输工具，在全省运输战线上发挥了巨大威力。全省9月份单是木帆船一项完成的运输量，就相当于全省火车、公路、轮船全月总运输量的一倍半。
    湖南省河道如织，有70％的县和公社可通帆船，加上近几年来各地大力疏通河道，大量修建水库渠道工程，为发展水上运输创造了新的条件。同时，湖南的耕牛多，而这些耕牛每年的服役期一般只有三至四个月。见缝插针，充分利用农隙，发展牛车运输，也大有可为。中共湖南省委分析了这些有利条件，一再指示各地大力发动群众，因地制宜地大造车船，大闹技术革新，积极发展民间运输工具。今年6月以来，各级党委根据省委指示，组织各行各业，在全省范围内掀起了一个全民性的大造车船运动。位于湘南山区的道县，几年来推广牛马车六千多部，木帆船八千多吨，各人民公社生产大队，做到队队通牛马车，河港渠道都通木帆船，从去年以来，这个县没有向上面要汽车运输，但全县工农业生产和日用生活物资一直无积压。中共湖南省委号召全省各地开展了一个“学道县、赶道县”的群众运动，有力地推动了全省民间运输工具的推广和使用。
    在大造车船的同时，各地十分重视发动群众大闹技术革新和技术革命，充分挖掘民间运输工具的潜力。木帆船运输部门的职工，开展以“增加浮力、加重载量、提高航速”为中心的技术革新运动，目前全省有70％左右的木帆船，推广了两船相帮、木船拖带、轻重配载、轻装剥皮等增加浮力的先进运输经验，一船增加运量30％至一倍，并且全省有30％左右的木帆船推广了“八面风”先进运输经验，利用风力推动船身，加快了航行速度。牛马车运输部门的职工，开展了以四化（风帆化、列车化、四轮化、装车半自动化）、“八改”（改双轮为四轮、改重车身为轻车身、改单车为拖车、改畜力单行为风帆助行、改单轴为双轴、改凹车箱为平板箱、改固定轮为转盘轮、改两人赶一车为一人赶多车）为中心的竞赛运动，充分挖掘了牛马车运输潜力。
