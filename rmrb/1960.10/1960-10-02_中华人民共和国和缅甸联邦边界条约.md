Xinhua News Agency, 1st October - Treaty of Friendship and Boundary Between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma

The Chairman of the People's Republic of China and the President of the Union of Burma,

Believing that the long-standing boundary issue between the two countries is a problem left over from history; that since the two countries successively achieved independence, the traditional friendly and good-neighborly relations between the two countries have gained new development; that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, jointly advocated by the Premiers of the two countries in 1954 as the guiding principles for the relations between the two countries with different social systems, have greatly promoted the friendly relations between the two countries and created conditions for the resolution of the boundary issue between the two countries;

Satisfied to see that the Government of the People's Republic of China and the successive Governments of the Union of Burma, in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have overcome various difficulties through friendly consultations, mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, and have finally smoothly and comprehensively resolved the boundary issue between the two countries;

Both sides firmly believe that the formal demarcation of the entire boundary between the two countries, and its transformation into a boundary of peace and friendship, is not only a milestone in the further development of friendly relations between China and Burma, but also a significant contribution to the maintenance of peace in Asia and the world;

For this purpose, both sides have decided to conclude this treaty on the basis of the Agreement between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Ne Win on the Boundary Question between the two countries signed on January 28, 1960, and have appointed their respective plenipotentiaries as follows:

The Chairman of the People's Republic of China has appointed Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council;

The President of the Union of Burma has appointed U Nu, Prime Minister.

The plenipotentiaries of both sides, having examined each other's credentials and found them to be in good and due form, have agreed upon the following articles:

                        Article 1

In accordance with the principles of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and in the spirit of friendly mutual accommodation, the Union of Burma agrees to return to China the areas of Hpimaw, Gawlum, and Kangfang (with an area of approximately 153 square kilometers, 59 square miles, as indicated on the attached map) belonging to China, and the People's Republic of China agrees to delineate the section of the boundary from the confluence of the Namhpai River and the Namdet River to the confluence of the Nam Hka River and the Nam Yung River in accordance with the notes exchanged between the Governments of China and the United Kingdom on June 18, 1941, subject to the adjustments provided for in Articles 2 and 3 of this Treaty.

                        Article 2

In view of the equal and friendly relations between China and Burma, both sides have decided to abolish the "perpetual lease" relationship maintained by Burma over the Meng-Mao Triangular Area (Namwan Assigned Tract) belonging to China. Considering the actual needs of the Burmese side, the Chinese side agrees to transfer this area (with an area of approximately 220 square kilometers, 85 square miles, as indicated on the attached map) to Burma, making it a part of the territory of the Union of Burma. In exchange, and also in consideration of historical ties and tribal integrity, the Burmese side agrees to cede the Panhung and Panlao areas (with an area of approximately 189 square kilometers, 73 square miles, as indicated on the attached map) under Burmese jurisdiction in accordance with the notes exchanged between the Governments of China and the United Kingdom on June 18, 1941, to China, making them a part of the territory of China.

                        Article 3

In order to facilitate the respective administrative management of both sides and to take into account the tribal relations and the needs of the local residents in terms of production and life, both sides agree to make some fair and reasonable adjustments to a small section of the boundary line delineated in the notes exchanged between the Governments of China and the United Kingdom on June 18, 1941, by assigning Yonghezhai and Longnaizhai to China and Yangbaizhai, Bankongzhai, Bannongzhai and Banwaizhai to Burma, so that these villages straddling the boundary line will no longer be divided by the boundary line.

                        Article 4

In accordance with its consistent policy of opposing foreign privileges and respecting the sovereignty of other countries, the Chinese Government declares that it renounces the right to participate in the operation of the Lufang mining enterprises in Burma, as stipulated in the notes exchanged between the Governments of China and the United Kingdom on June 18, 1941.

                        Article 5

The Contracting Parties agree that the section of the boundary from Kaungkaw Mountain to the western terminal point of the Sino-Burmese boundary, with the exception of the Hpimaw, Gawlum and Kangfang areas, shall be determined in accordance with the traditional customary line, that is, from Kaungkaw Mountain, northward along the watershed between the Taiping River, the Shweli River, the Nu River, the Dulong River above Hsichingtan on the one hand, and the N'Mai Hka River on the other hand, until a point on the southern bank of the Dulong River west of Hsichingtan, thence across the Dulong River, and thence continuing along the watershed between the Dulong River above Hsichingtan and the Tsayul River on the one hand and all the tributaries of the Irrawaddy River upstream from Hsichingtan, with the exception of the Dulong River above Hsichingtan, on the other hand, to the western terminal point of the Sino-Burmese boundary.

    中华人民共和国主席和缅甸联邦总统，
    一致认为，两国间久悬未决的边界问题，是历史上遗留下来的问题；在两国先后取得独立以后，两国之间传统的友好睦邻关系获得了新的发展；1954年两国总理共同倡议了不同社会制度的国家和平共处的五项原则，作为两国关系的指导原则，更大大促进了两国的友好关系，并且为两国边界问题的解决创造了条件；
    满意地看到，中华人民共和国政府和缅甸联邦历届政府根据和平共处的五项原则，友好协商，互谅互让，克服了种种困难，终于顺利地全面地解决了两国边界问题；
    双方坚信，两国间全部边界的正式划定，并且成为一条和平友好的边界，不仅是中缅两国友好关系进一步发展的里程碑，而且也是对维护亚洲和世界和平的重大贡献；
    为此，双方决定在1960年1月28日周恩来总理和奈温总理签订的关于两国边界问题协定的基础上，缔结本条约，并各派全权代表如下：

    缔约双方同意，从尖高山到中缅边界西端终点的一段边界，除片马、古浪、岗房地区以外，按照传统的习惯线定界，也就是从尖高山起，沿着以太平江、瑞丽江、怒江、西靖丹以上的独龙江为一方、恩梅开江为另一方的分水岭向北，直到在西靖丹以西独龙江南岸的一点，由此跨过独龙江，然后继续沿着以西靖丹以上的独龙江和察隅河为一方和除西靖丹以上的独龙江以外的全部伊洛瓦底江上游支系为另一方的分水岭，直到中缅边界西端终点为止。
                        第　六　条
    缔约双方确认，从尖高山到南帕河和南定河汇合处以及从南卡江和南永河汇合处到中缅边界东南端终点南腊河和澜沧江
