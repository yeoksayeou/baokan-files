Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, 8th: The Afghan newspaper "Islah" published an editorial on the 6th, expressing support for the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. The editorial stated that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate representative of the Chinese people.

The editorial reiterated the speech of the Afghan Permanent Representative to the United Nations, who stated that Afghanistan opposes the United States excluding the issue of restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations from the agenda of the General Assembly.

The editorial then pointed out that Afghanistan's position is based on the fact that, on the one hand, China and Afghanistan are close neighbors and have peaceful and friendly relations, and on the other hand, Afghanistan has always supported the cause of justice.
