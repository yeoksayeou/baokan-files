This newspaper Tianjin, October 10th dispatch: Hebei Province’s Jingxing Coal Mine has achieved an all-round leap forward in production and quality. From January to August, it overfulfilled the state plan every month. Entering September, the mine's production has reached a new level. In September, coal production exceeded the plan by more than 2,300 tons, a 4% increase compared to August. Ash content was 0.45% lower than the state plan, and 0.04% lower than August. Sulfur content reached the state planned target. Since the beginning of this year, the mine has received 28 commendatory letters and banners from users such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant.

Jingxing Coal Mine is a large-scale coal mine famous throughout the country for its production of prime coking coal. Since the beginning of this year, leading cadres at all levels of the mine have persisted in going deep into production teams, educating workers on high yield based on high quality through methods such as analyzing the production situation, holding quality exhibitions, and organizing mass forums. While arranging production targets every quarter, month, and ten-day period, they also put forward quality requirements, mobilized workers to discuss and formulate specific measures to ensure quality, and implemented them in teams, groups, and individuals, making the production of more and better coal a conscious action of the workers.

After the Party issued the call to launch the production increase and conservation campaign centered on grain and steel in mid-August, the mine's Party committee further called on all mine workers to increase coal production significantly while improving coal quality to support steel production. In discussions, workers calculated in detail: if the gangue content of raw coal is 1%, then one million tons of coal would contain ten thousand tons of gangue, which is equivalent to reducing the amount of coking coal available to steel mills by ten thousand tons, directly affecting steel production and quality, and also causing significant waste in transportation. Through discussion, workers became more aware of the importance of improving the yield and quality of coking coal in promoting steel production, further strengthening their sense of responsibility. The idea that everyone is responsible for improving coal quality has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

While strengthening ideological education, the mine also strengthened the coking coal quality management organization and established and improved the coking coal quality management system. From the mine to the mine shafts, the secretaries took the lead and established a Coking Coal Quality Improvement Committee, which regularly convened professional meetings to analyze and study the coking coal quality situation, promptly mobilize and rely on the masses to summarize advanced experiences in improving coal quality, and establish and improve hand-selection, testing, coal car labeling, quality acceptance and other systems. Each production team also selected an experienced and responsible worker to serve as a part-time quality inspector, specifically responsible for checking the quality of coal and studying measures to improve coking coal quality. In this way, professional coking coal quality inspection and mass inspection were closely combined, forming a rigorous coal quality inspection network from top to bottom, left to right, throughout the mine. From coal miners to electric chute operators, from transportation workers to coal washing workers, everyone guarded the quality at every point and picked gangue, achieving "three picks" (picking at the coal mining face, picking on the electric chute, picking on the coal car) and "four no's" (no gangue on the shovel, electric chute, coal car, or train), greatly improving the quality of raw coal.

With the idea of giving equal importance to quality and quantity deeply rooted in practice, the enthusiasm for class and group competitions focusing on high quality and high yield has surged higher and higher. Advanced individuals and advanced deeds of high quality and high yield continue to emerge. In the "five checkpoints" (coal dropping checkpoint, alleyway checkpoint, air duct checkpoint, out-of-well checkpoint, wellhead checkpoint) competition to improve quality in the Second Mine, the 204 coal mining team put forward the slogan of not allowing gangue to leave the alleyway, achieving everyone picking gangue, everywhere picking gangue. Zhao Baoshan was careful and meticulous when loading coal, not letting go of even a small piece of gangue. Under his leadership and help, the gangue content of raw coal quickly dropped to 0.5% (the prescribed target is no more than 2%), becoming a high-quality and high-yield red flag for the entire mine. Workers in the auxiliary selection teams at each wellhead were not to be outdone, launching a wave of learning from and catching up with the 204 coal mining team, adopting fast eyes, fast hands, and fast legs, and strengthening cooperation between the three shifts, not allowing a single piece of gangue to pass. As a result of this pursuit, the gangue content of the entire mine was greatly reduced.

Under the guidance of the idea of high quality and high yield, the mining and tunneling workers also launched a vigorous competition, and the progress of mining and tunneling continued to improve.

### 职工全心全意支援钢铁增产  井陉焦煤优质高产受到赞扬  全矿人人拣?石，处处把关口，上下左右形成质量检查网

    职工全心全意支援钢铁增产
    井陉焦煤优质高产受到赞扬
    全矿人人拣?石，处处把关口，上下左右形成质量检查网
    本报天津10日电　河北省井陉煤矿产量、质量全面跃进。1至8月份，月月全面超额完成了国家计划。进入9月，全矿生产更上一层楼。9月份煤产量超额二千三百多吨完成计划，比8月提高4％，灰分比国家计划降低0.45％，比8月份降低0.04％，含?率达到国家计划指标。今年以来，这个矿光收到鞍钢、包钢、石景山钢铁厂等用户的表扬信件、锦旗等就有二十八件。
    井陉煤矿是以盛产主焦煤驰名全国的大型煤矿。今年以来，这个矿的各级领导干部坚持深入生产小组，通过分析生产形势，举办质量展览会，组织群众座谈等方法，对职工进行在优质的基础上高产的教育，并在每季、每月、每旬布置产量指标的同时，提出质量的要求，发动职工讨论订出保证质量的具体措施，落实到班、组和个人，使多出煤，出好煤成为职工群众的自觉行动。
    8月中旬，党发出开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的号召以后，这个矿的党委进一步号召全矿职工在大幅度增加煤炭产量的同时，提高煤的质量，支援钢铁生产。职工在座谈讨论中，算了一笔细账：如果原煤含?率是1％的话，一百万吨煤中就有一万吨?石，等于使钢铁厂减少一万吨焦煤，不仅直接影响到钢铁产量和质量，在运输上也会造成很大的浪费。通过讨论，职工更加认清了提高焦煤产量和质量对促进钢铁生产的重要意义，进一步加强了责任感，提高煤炭质量人人有责的思想深入人心。
    在加强思想教育的同时，这个矿还充实了焦煤质量管理机构，建立和健全了焦煤质量管理制度。从矿到矿井都由书记挂帅，成立了提高焦煤质量委员会，定期召开专业会议，分析研究焦煤质量情况，及时发动和依靠群众总结提高煤炭质量的先进经验，建立和健全了手选、化验、煤车挂牌、质量验收等制度。各个生产小组，还都推选出了一名经验丰富、认真负责的工人兼作质量检查员，专门负责检查煤的质量，研究提高焦煤质量措施。这样，专职的焦煤质量检查和群众性的检查密切结合起来，在全矿形成了一个上下左右严密的煤炭质量检查网，从采煤工到电溜子司机，从运输工到洗煤工处处把关口，人人拣?石，作到了“三拣”（采煤工作面拣、电溜子上拣、煤车上拣）、“四不上”（?石不上锨、电溜子、煤车、火车），原煤质量大大提高。
    这个矿随着质量和产量并举的思想步步深入，以优质、高产为主要内容的班、组竞赛热潮，一浪高过一浪。优质、高产的先进人物和先进事迹不断涌现。二矿在开展提高质量的“把五关”（落煤关、巷口关、风筒关、出井关、井口关）竞赛中，二○四采煤队，提出不让?石出巷口的口号，作到了人人拣?石、处处拣?石。赵宝山在装煤时认真仔细，那怕有一块小?石，也不放过。这个队在他的带动和帮助下，使原煤含?率迅速降低到0.5％（规定指标不超过2％），成为全矿井的优质、高产红旗。各井口付选队的工人也不甘示弱，开展了学、赶二○四采煤队的热潮，采取眼快、手快和腿快的操作方法，并且加强三班之间的协作，不让一块?石过关。这样你追我赶的结果，使全矿的含?率大大降低。
    在优质、高产的思想指导下，采掘职工也开展了热火朝天的竞赛，采掘进度不断提高。
