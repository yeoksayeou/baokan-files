    (Our Report) Tianjin Municipal Party committees at all levels have adopted various effective measures to cultivate and train urban people's commune cadres. Through training, the cadres' political and ideological levels and professional work abilities have been rapidly improved, enabling the various undertakings of the communes to be further consolidated and improved.

    The development of the urban people's commune movement in Tianjin has been very rapid. Since the establishment of the first batch of communes in 1958, the city has now established 47 communes with a population of three million. In order to adapt to this new situation and further promote the development of the commune cause, Party committees at all levels have focused on strengthening the cultivation and training of cadres. The Municipal Party Committee and the District Party Committee Urban People's Commune Offices have special organizations or dedicated personnel responsible for carrying out cadre cultivation work. In the past two years, in addition to the Municipal Party Committee and the District Party Committees allocating more than 1,000 cadres to the city's 47 communes, Party committees at all levels have also trained more than 19,000 cadres at all levels in the communes through various forms. Most of the city's more than 14,000 cadres and grassroots leaders have already been trained once in rotation.

    In the work of training cadres, Party committees at all levels have mainly adopted a method that combines short-term rotational training with long-term cultivation, and combines supplementing what is lacking with systematic improvement. They have vigorously adopted flexible and diverse training forms such as Party schools, red and expert schools, political training classes, cadre study classes, and reading groups. The Municipal Party Committee has focused on cultivating and improving the work of leading cadres of the communes. In July of this year, the Municipal Party Committee held a training class for the first secretaries of the commune Party committees. The secretaries of the Municipal Party Committee and the responsible comrades of relevant departments personally lectured at the training class. Through more than half a month of off-the-job study, the first secretaries of the Party committees of the communes further clarified the Party's principles and policies concerning commune issues, systematically summarized and exchanged work experience, and jointly studied specific measures for consolidating and improving the communes in the future. After the first secretaries of the Party committees of the communes studied, they immediately set off a high tide in the communes to improve work methods and work styles and strengthen commune construction. The first secretary of the Wangchuanchang Commune Party Committee, through study, further strengthened ideological leadership and improved the relationship between factories and communes. The Party Committee conducted a serious analysis of the specific situation of the sixteen state-owned factories in the commune, and then organized all the cadres of the commune to educate the cadres to establish the idea of serving the large-scale industry through methods such as seminars, reports, and on-site observation. At the same time, the Party Committee further strengthened the relationship between factories and communes through holding forums for factory and commune leading cadres, conducting visits, and reporting to leading cadres who concurrently hold leadership positions as secretaries and directors of large factories and communes.

    In addition to the Municipal Party Committee's planned training of leading cadres of the communes, the District Party Committees and the Commune Party Committees focused on training cadres at all levels of the communes, especially cadres of the branch communes. Most of the cadres of branch communes and grassroots production and life units were originally activists in the streets. These people have close relations with the masses and have always worked diligently and conscientiously, wholeheartedly completing the various tasks assigned by the Party. However, their cultural level is relatively low, they lack systematic policy and theoretical knowledge, and they lack management experience in commune work. In view of this situation, Party committees at all levels have adopted various appropriate methods to train them in batches and in stages. Some adopted a trickle-down approach, using spare time to study. They study whatever they lack in their work, and they study and solve any important problems that arise at any time. Some adopted a short-term intensive approach, running a training class for a central task or a major problem in a certain stage. Others adopted a method of working half a day and studying half a day, learning and guiding work at the same time. Still others used two or three months to organize cadres to study off the job, systematically improving their theoretical and professional knowledge. After training in various forms, these activists quickly improved their leadership level and adapted to the needs of current work. The Fourth Branch of Guozhuangzi Commune is a well-known advanced unit in the city with a frugal atmosphere and sound system. The twelve cadres who are in charge of leading this branch are all "grandmas" who are forty or fifty years old. In the past, they mainly did street work such as resident mediation, environmental sanitation, and support for the army and preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. However, after training, learning, and exercising in their work, they not only are competent in leading the comprehensive work of the branch commune's production and life, but also have created many new work methods. The branch established a complete set of systems for collective leadership, division of labor and responsibility, financial approval, and current affairs and theory study. In their work, these twelve "grandmas" also adopted the working method of going deep into the front line of production and conducting command by following shifts, making the various tasks of the branch well-organized and achieving comprehensive development.

    While holding various training classes, Party committees at all levels also adopted the method of learning while doing and improving through practice, and constantly summarized and promoted new working methods and work experiences. More than 3,000 grassroots cadres from the twelve communes in Heping District launched a "five-good" competition between cadres. Through the competition, role models were established and experience was disseminated. Since the competition was launched in March of this year, more than 150 advanced experiences have been disseminated throughout the district, enabling the cadres' work level to be continuously improved. The secretaries and committee members of the various commune Party committees have also universally adopted the training method of going deep into the front line and personally helping grassroots cadres improve their work and improve their management work abilities. This not only improved the work style of the leading cadres of the communes, but also effectively trained the grassroots cadres.

    干部领导水平迅速提高，促使公社各项事业进一步巩固发展
    本报讯　天津市各级党委采取各种有效措施，培养和训练城市人民公社干部。通过培训，迅速提高了干部的政治思想水平和业务工作能力，使公社的各项事业得到了进一步的巩固和提高。
    天津市城市人民公社运动的发展是很快的，从1958年建立第一批公社开始，到目前，全市已经建立了拥有三百万人口的四十七个公社。为了适应这个新的形势和进一步推动公社事业的发展，各级党委着重加强了干部的培养和训练工作。市委和区委城市人民公社办公室，都设有专门组织或专人负责进行培养干部的工作。两年来，除了市委和区委为全市四十七个公社配备了一千多名干部以外，各级党委还通过各种形式培训了公社各级干部一万九千多人次，全市一万四千多名干部和基层负责人大部分都已轮训过一次。
    各级党委在培训干部的工作中，主要采取了短期轮训和长期培养相结合、缺什么补什么和系统提高相结合的方法，大力采用了党校、红专学校、政治训练班、干部学习班、读书会等灵活多样的培训形式。市委重点抓了培养和提高公社领导干部的工作，今年7月间，市委曾举办了公社党委第一书记训练班，市委书记以及各有关部门负责同志，亲自到训练班讲课。各公社党委第一书记通过半个多月的离职学习，进一步明确了党的有关公社问题的方针、政策，系统地总结和交流了工作经验，并且共同研究了今后巩固、提高公社的具体措施。各公社党委第一书记学习以后，立即在公社内掀起了一个改进工作方法和工作作风、加强公社建设的高潮。王串场公社党委第一书记通过学习，进一步加强了思想领导，改进了厂社关系。党委对公社内十六个国营工厂的具体情况进行了认真地分析，然后组织全社干部通过座谈、报告会、现场观摩等方法，教育干部树立为大工业服务的思想；同时党委又通过进行厂社领导干部座谈、访问，以及向大工厂书记、厂长兼公社领导职务的领导干部进行汇报等方式，进一步密切了厂社关系。
    除了市委有计划地培训公社领导干部以外，各区委和公社党委着重培训公社各级干部，特别是分社干部。分社和基层生产、生活等单位的干部，绝大部分是原来街道中的积极分子。这些人和群众的关系密切，工作中一直勤勤恳恳、任劳任怨，一心一意地完成党所交给的各项工作。但是他们的文化水平比较低，缺少系统的政策理论知识，对公社工作缺乏管理经验。针对这种情况，各级党委采取了各种适当的方法，分期分批地进行了培训。有的采取细水长流的方式，利用业余时间进行学习，工作中缺少什么就学什么，遇到什么重要问题就随时研究解决。有的采取短期突击的方式，就一项中心工作或一个阶段的重大问题开办一期训练班。还有的采取半日工作半日学习的方式，边学习边指导工作。也有的利用两、三个月的时间组织干部离职学习，系统地提高理论和业务知识。经过多样形式的培训，这些积极分子很快地提高了领导水平，适应了当前工作需要。郭庄子公社第四分社是全市著名的勤俭成风、制度健全的先进单位，而担任这个分社领导工作的十二名干部，都是年纪在四、五十岁的大娘。她们过去主要是作一些居民调解、环境卫生、拥军优属等街道工作，但是经过培训、学习和工作中的锻炼，她们不仅胜任了领导分社生产、生活等全面工作，而且还创造了许多新的工作方法。分社建立了集体领导、分工负责、财会审批、时事理论学习等一套完整的制度。在工作中，这十二位大娘还采取了深入生产第一线，跟班劳动进行指挥的工作方法，把分社的各项工作作得井井有条，获得全面发展。
    各级党委在举办各种训练班的同时，还采取了边干边学，在实际工作中锻炼提高的方法，随时总结、推广新的工作方法和工作经验。和平区十二个公社的三千多名基层干部，展开了干部与干部间的五好竞赛。通过竞赛，树立标兵，传播经验，从今年3月份开展竞赛以来，已经在全区传播了一百五十多项先进经验，使干部的工作水平不断得到提高。各公社党委书记和党委委员，还普遍地采取了深入第一线，亲自帮助基层干部改进工作、提高管理工作能力的培训方法。这样，既改进了公社领导干部的作风，又有效地培训了基层干部。
