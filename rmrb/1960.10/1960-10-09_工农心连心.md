Workers and peasants, hearts linked together,
The locomotive and the train cars together.
The locomotive and the train cars are inseparable,
Workers and peasants are one family.
Supporting each other, united tightly,
Workers and peasants' production leaps forward together.
Factories and mines wear a new look,
Poor gullies become new socialist villages.

    工农心连心工人农民心连心，火车头来火车身。车头车身不可分，工人农民一家人。互相支援团结紧，工农生产双跃进。工厂矿山面貌新，穷沟变成新农村。
