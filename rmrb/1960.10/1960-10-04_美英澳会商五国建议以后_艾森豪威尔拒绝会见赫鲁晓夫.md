Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Washington: The United States government yesterday released identical reply letters from Eisenhower to Indonesian President Sukarno, Ghanaian President Nkrumah, United Arab Republic President Nasser, Yugoslav President Tito, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru. In the reply letters, Eisenhower rejected the suggestion made by them in a joint proposal submitted to the United Nations General Assembly on September 30 that Eisenhower meet with Khrushchev.

Eisenhower hypocritically stated in the letter that the United States "is willing to hold talks with anyone at any time if there is a definite hope of producing positive results." However, he then slandered that "there is nothing in the words and deeds" of the Soviet government "that gives me any reason to believe that the talks you suggest have any such hope." He also attacked the Soviet Union for "deliberately pursuing a policy of exacerbating world tensions and, in particular, damaging relations with the United States." He said, "I do not wish to participate in a gesture that would, in the present circumstances, only create misunderstanding and unfortunate impressions for the people of the world."

Eisenhower also stated in the letter that because "the main problems of the world today are not solely due to differences between the Soviet Union and the United States," he believes that "solutions on a (Soviet-American) bilateral basis are impossible."

Eisenhower's letter once again arrogantly put forward the so-called conditions for holding negotiations. He threatened that if there were to be negotiations, the Soviet Union must "pave the way for fruitful negotiations in the United Nations and elsewhere," and that the United States would only be prepared to conduct "negotiations" with the heads of government of the Soviet Union and other relevant countries when exploratory discussions between the two sides "show that the Soviet Union is prepared to return to the path of peaceful coexistence negotiations and there is some prospect of producing results."

According to the White House, Eisenhower held talks with British Prime Minister Macmillan and Australian Prime Minister Menzies at the White House yesterday before sending these letters. It is reported that the above-mentioned five-nation proposal was the primary focus of the meeting. It is said that the main purpose of the talks was to "coordinate the West's strategy (against the Soviet Union)."

British Foreign Secretary Home, in a press interview on a New York television program yesterday, said that it was useless to convene a "Paris-style" summit unless it was certain to produce "results." He declared, "I myself will not participate in another top-level meeting without very careful preparation." Home said he favored negotiations at a lower level.

    美英澳会商五国建议以后
    艾森豪威尔拒绝会见赫鲁晓夫
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府昨天公布了艾森豪威尔分别写给印度尼西亚总统苏加诺、加纳总统恩克鲁玛、阿联总统纳赛尔、南斯拉夫总统铁托以及印度总理尼赫鲁五人内容相同的复信。艾森豪威尔在复信中拒绝他们9月30日在一项向联合国大会提出的联合提案中关于艾森豪威尔同赫鲁晓夫举行会见的建议。
    艾森豪威尔在信中虚伪地表示，美国“愿意和任何人在任何时候举行会谈，如果确切有希望产生积极效果的话”。但是他接着就诬蔑苏联政府的“言行中没有任何东西使我有任何理由相信你所建议的会谈有任何这种希望”，他还攻击苏联“故意实行一种加剧世界紧张局势以及特别是损害同美国的关系的政策”。他说，“我不希望参与在目前情况下仅仅会使世界人民产生误解和不幸印象的一种姿态”。
    艾森豪威尔在信中还表示，由于“当前世界的主要问题并不单单是由于苏联和美国之间的分歧”，因此，他认为“在（苏联同美国）双边基础上的解决办法是不可能的”。
    艾森豪威尔的信中再次蛮横地提出所谓举行谈判的条件。他扬言，如果要谈判，苏联必须“在联合国和其他地方……为有成效的谈判铺平道路”，而且只有在双方代表“探讨性的讨论显示苏联准备回到和平共处谈判的道路，并有产生效果的某种前景”时，美国才准备同苏联以及其他有关国家的政府首脑进行“谈判”。
    据白宫宣布，艾森豪威尔昨天在发出这些信件之前，曾经在白宫同英国首相麦克米伦和澳大利亚总理孟席斯举行了会谈。据报道，上述五国建议在这次会谈中占首要地位。据说，会谈主要目的是“协调西方（对付苏联）的战略”。
    英国外交大臣霍姆昨天在纽约电视节目里对报界发表谈话时表示，召开“巴黎式”的首脑会议是没有用处的，除非它肯定会产生“结果”。他宣称，“没有十分仔细的准备，我自己不会参与另一次最高级会议的。”霍姆说，他赞成在较低一级举行谈判。
