Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: All parts of the country are strengthening field management of autumn vegetables, focusing on watering, topdressing, and pest and disease control, and are making early preparations for harvesting, storage, transportation, processing, and other work. At present, autumn vegetables are growing vigorously in most areas; Northeast China is about to harvest, and the South is still in the season of continuous sowing. This is a crucial period to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables.

After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued instructions on autumn vegetable production, a high tide of planting autumn vegetables was immediately set off in urban and rural areas across the country. The area of basic vegetable fields was greatly increased, and full use was made of intercropping of grain and vegetables, wasteland reclamation, and "ten-edge" land for planting vegetables, with a wide planting range and many new vegetable fields. Party committees at all levels have further strengthened their leadership over autumn vegetable management work and established a professional front for vegetable production. The area of autumn vegetables in Hebei Province has expanded by about 2.6 times compared with last year, and most vegetable fields have been cultivated, weeded, topdressed, watered, and pest and disease controlled in a timely manner. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, all walks of life in various places have also carried out activities to support vegetable production, with urban and rural people working together to carry out mass movements on a large scale. In order to support vegetable production, the commercial departments of Tianjin sent pesticides and machinery to the fields and helped communes with repairs.

In order to exchange management experience in a timely manner, various localities have adopted methods of inspection, evaluation, and on-the-spot consultation to carry out "learn from, catch up with, and surpass" competitions, which have improved management technology. Beijing has put forward the action slogan of "Autumn vegetables will not be harvested for a day, and management will not stop for a day." The people's communes in the suburbs have taken active measures to tightly control the three key factors of water, fertilizer, and pests and diseases to manage the vegetable fields well.

In view of the large area of vegetable fields and the wide planting range, various localities have not only strengthened the management of commodity vegetables and concentrated basic vegetable fields, but also attached importance to the management of vegetables for self-consumption, intercropping, wasteland reclamation, and scattered vegetable plots.

Many areas have made practical arrangements for the harvesting, storage, transportation, processing, seed selection, and seed retention of autumn vegetables. At the provincial vegetable work conference convened by the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the experiences of various localities in harvesting and storage last year were summarized and promoted. The Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to educate urban and rural people to cherish vegetables and not to discard leaves or stems casually when autumn vegetables are on the market in large quantities.

This newspaper reports that the peak season for autumn vegetables is approaching, and Beijing has comprehensively launched preparations for storing autumn vegetables.

This year, Beijing's preparations for storing autumn vegetables started early and acted quickly. The competent authorities made comprehensive plans and deployments in advance. Based on the characteristics of large autumn vegetable production, concentrated harvest time, and long supply time, it was decided to continue to draw on last year's experience: under the unified national plan, organize people's communes in suburban areas, commercial departments, collective consumption units such as institutions, organizations, schools, and factories and mines, as well as general residents, to participate in the work of storing autumn vegetables. In order to do this work well, all districts have strengthened their leadership. Many districts are personally led by the district party secretary, strengthening the original vegetable headquarters to unify command of the autumn vegetable storage work. Since the beginning of September, contact and cooperation between urban and rural areas has begun. Now, many people's communes, commercial departments, and collective consumption units in suburban areas are seizing the opportunity to rush to build vegetable cellars. Relevant departments are also actively arranging the transportation of autumn vegetables. In order to keep vegetables well and strive to prevent spoilage and loss, many suburban areas have organized exchanges of experience in storing vegetables. (Attached picture)

    抓紧时机加强秋菜管理
    提前做好收菜贮菜准备
    北京市组织生产、消费、供应等单位积极准备贮菜
    据新华社讯　全国各地正加强以浇水、追肥、防治病虫害为中心的秋菜田间管理，并且及早准备收获、贮藏、运输、加工等工作。目前，大部地区秋菜正在旺盛生长；东北各地即将收获，南方仍是继续播种的季节，正是力争秋菜多收的关键时期。
    在中共中央、国务院发出关于秋季蔬菜生产的指示后，全国城乡立即掀起了大种秋菜的高潮，基本菜田大大增加，并且充分利用粮、菜间作，开荒和“十边”地种菜，种植范围广，新菜田多。各级党委对秋菜管理工作都进一步加强了领导，建立了蔬菜生产的专业战线。河北省秋菜面积比去年扩大约二点六倍，大部分菜田已适时中耕、除草、追肥、浇水、防治病虫。各地在党委的领导下，各行各业也开展支援蔬菜生产的活动，城乡人民一齐动手，大搞群众运动。天津市商业部门为支援蔬菜生产，把农药、械送到地头，并帮助公社修理。
    为了及时交流管理经验，各地采用检查、评比、就地会诊的办法，开展“学、赶、超”竞赛，提高了管理技术。北京市提出“秋菜一天不收，管理一天不休”的行动口号，郊区各人民公社采取积极的措施，紧把水、肥、病虫三道关，管好菜田。
    根据菜田面积大、种植范围广的情况，各地不仅加强了商品菜和集中成片的基本菜田的管理，同时重视了自食菜，间作、开荒和零星隙地的菜地管理。
    许多地区已切实安排秋菜的收、贮、运、加工以及选种、留种等工作。中共辽宁省委在为此召开的全省蔬菜工作会议上，总结和推广了去年各地在收获、贮藏等方面的经验。省委要求各地在秋菜大批上市的时候，要教育城乡人民珍惜蔬菜，不随便丢掉一帮一叶。
    本报讯　秋菜上市的旺季就要来到，北京市全面开展了贮存秋菜的准备工作。
    今年北京的秋菜贮存准备工作，动手早、行动快。主管部门提前作出了全面规划，进行了部署。根据秋菜产量大、收获时间集中和供应时间长的特点，决定继续吸取去年的经验：在国家统一计划下，组织郊区人民公社、商业部门和机关团体、学校、厂矿等集体消费单位，以及一般居民，都来参加贮存秋菜的工作。为了做好这一工作，各区都加强了领导，不少区由区委书记亲自挂帅，加强了原有的蔬菜指挥部，统一指挥秋菜贮存工作。从9月初开始，城乡之间就开始联系挂钩。现在，很多郊区人民公社、商业部门和集体消费单位，都在抓紧时机，突击修建菜窖。有关部门还正积极安排秋菜调运工作。为了把蔬菜保管好，力争不烂不丢，不少郊区都组织交流储藏蔬菜的经验。（附图片）
