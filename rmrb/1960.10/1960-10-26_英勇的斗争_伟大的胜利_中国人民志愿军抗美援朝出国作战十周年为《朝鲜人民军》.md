    Heroic Struggle, Great Victory
    —Written for the “Korean People’s Army” Newspaper on the Tenth Anniversary of the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army’s War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    Luo Ruiqing, Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, General

    Ten years ago today—October 25, 1950—the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, holding high the banner of "Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, Protecting Our Homes and Defending Our Country," crossed the Yalu River and fought shoulder to shoulder with the heroic Korean People's Army against the American aggressors. Now, ten years have passed, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, after completing the glorious mission given to them by the people of the motherland, also returned home in triumph two years ago, laden with the deep friendship of the Korean people. Today, as we commemorate this glorious day together with the fraternal Korean people, we feel无比的兴奋 as we look back on the great victory achieved by the people of our two countries in the common struggle against the enemy.

    Ten years ago, just as the people of North Korea were devoting themselves to peaceful domestic construction, and just as the Chinese people had just achieved victory in the democratic revolution and were vigorously carrying out economic recovery and construction, the American aggressors mobilized one-third of their army, one-fifth of their air force, and most of their navy, following the old path of Japanese imperialism, and flagrantly launched a large-scale war of aggression against Korea, while simultaneously occupying our territory of Taiwan by armed force. The arrogant goal of U.S. imperialism in its aggression against Korea was to attempt to destroy Korea in one fell swoop, and then invade China, in order to realize its wild ambition of dominating Asia and dominating the world. In the eyes of the American aggressors, they believed that they possessed "unparalleled" military superiority, and that the young Democratic People's Republic of Korea would be unable to resist their barbaric attacks; the newly born People's Republic of China would also not dare to rise up to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Therefore, they turned a deaf ear to the repeated warnings and proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue put forward by both China and Korea, and continued to expand the war of aggression, burning the flames of war all the way to the Sino-Korean border, while arrogantly clamoring that "historically, the Yalu River is not an insurmountable obstacle that sharply divides the two countries (China and Korea)." At this critical moment, which concerned the safety of China and Korea and the fate of peace in Asia and the world, the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, resolutely rose up to resist the war and gave the aggressors a head-on blow. Subsequently, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, launched a vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and formed the Volunteer Army with their outstanding sons and daughters to fight against the aggressors together with the Korean people. After the joint struggle of the Chinese and Korean troops, winning five battles in five campaigns, the aggressors were finally driven back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, and they suffered more than 220,000 casualties. At this time, the invincible arrogance of the American aggressors was slightly restrained, and they were forced to sit down and hold armistice negotiations with China and Korea. This fact clearly shows that when the American aggressors imposed the war on the people of China and Korea, should the people of China and Korea succumb to imperialism and beg for peace, or should they bravely take up weapons and extinguish the war of aggression with a just war? This was a serious choice. The people of China and Korea, under the correct leadership of the parties of the two countries, chose the path of resolute resistance, which was completely correct. If at that time we had not resolutely opposed the unjust war of aggression with a just war of anti-aggression, but had adopted a policy of compromise and surrender, then the consequences would obviously have been unimaginable. Similarly, after the war started, if the aggressors were not really hurt, they would never negotiate peace with us.

    In the two-year-plus Korean armistice negotiations, every agreement that was conducive to achieving an armistice was obtained through the arduous struggle of the people of China and Korea. People clearly remember how arrogant the American aggressors were at the beginning of the armistice negotiations! They not only arrogantly demanded so-called "compensation for air and sea superiority," attempting to occupy 12,000 square kilometers of land without firing a single shot; but also, after this unreasonable demand was resolutely rejected by China and Korea, launched the so-called "debate of machine guns and artillery," intending to force China and Korea to submit to its military blackmail. Only after China and Korea resolutely fought back, thoroughly shattering its summer and autumn offensives, and causing the aggressors to suffer even more惨重 losses than in the previous five battles, did the American aggressors return to the negotiating table. After this, the American aggressors were still unwilling to give up and continued to play their counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics. On the one hand, they adopted despicable tricks such as making unreasonable troubles and absenting themselves from meetings to delay the negotiations in every possible way; on the other hand, they desperately struggled on the battlefield, constantly launching offensives, and even conducting bacteriological warfare with a lack of humanity, attempting to force China and Korea to submit. In response to this conspiracy of the aggressors, the people's armies of China and Korea steadfastly adopted revolutionary two-handed tactics. On the one hand, they thoroughly exposed the ugly faces of the American aggressors in the negotiations and strived to find ways to reach an armistice agreement; on the other hand, and more importantly, they resolutely inflicted heavy blows on the offensives of the American aggressors on the battlefield. In this way, the armistice negotiations, which had been on the verge of collapse several times, were saved. Until the summer of 1953, the people's armies of China and Korea launched a powerful counterattack, breaking through the positions of four divisions of the aggressors in one fell swoop, rapidly shifting the battle line to the south, and the situation became extremely unfavorable to the aggressors, and only then did U.S. imperialism hastily demand an armistice. In this way, after a struggle of fighting and talking, with fighting as the main factor, and military and political factors intertwined, the people of China and Korea finally forced U.S. imperialism to sign the armistice agreement and admit defeat. The great victory of the people of China and Korea not only caused the American aggressors to suffer惨重 military defeat, defended the independence of Korea and the security of China, and defended the Far Eastern outpost of the socialist camp, but also exposed the true face of U.S. imperialism as a paper tiger in front of the people of the world, greatly encouraging the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism, for the defense of world peace, for national independence, democratic freedom, and socialism. This great victory also eloquently proves that it is necessary to wage a tit-for-tat struggle against imperialism. Only by resolutely struggling can we defeat aggression and defend peace. Seeking peace through struggle can achieve peace; seeking peace through concession will inevitably lead to the loss of peace. This is a Marxist-Leninist truth that Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly expounded.

    The realization of the Korean armistice is a great victory of historic significance jointly won by the people of China and Korea and the people of the world who love peace and uphold justice. However, the armistice does not mean that U.S. imperialism has abandoned its ambition for aggression. Everyone knows that U.S. imperialism is unwilling to stabilize the armistice situation in Korea, thereby enabling the Korean issue to be resolved peacefully. Therefore, after the Korean armistice, maintaining the armistice agreement and further seeking a peaceful solution to the Korean issue is still a serious struggle. For more than seven years, China and Korea have consistently and strictly implemented the armistice agreement and have continuously made great efforts for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Korean government has repeatedly put forward proposals for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and has taken a series of positive measures. The Chinese people have also consistently supported the various proposals put forward by the Korean government. Two years ago, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army withdrew completely from Korea in response to the peaceful initiatives of the governments of China and Korea and to promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. All the efforts made by the governments of China and Korea for peace have been warmly supported by the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and by peace-loving countries and people all over the world. However, in contrast, U.S. imperialism has consistently adopted various despicable means to undermine the implementation of the armistice agreement and obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue from the moment the armistice agreement was signed. Before the ink on the armistice agreement was dry, the warmonger Dulles signed the "U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty" with Syngman Rhee, attempting to allow the U.S. aggressor troops to stay in South Korea for a long time. In recent years, the American aggressors have constantly carried out military provocations, even openly transporting atomic weapons into South Korea and establishing missile bases in South Korea. Faced with this situation, while striving to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, the people of China and Korea cannot but maintain a high degree of vigilance and cannot but thoroughly expose and resolutely struggle against the shameless provocations and conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, which is why the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to undermine the armistice has not succeeded. These facts clearly tell us that not only does negotiating with imperialism require relying on the resolute struggle of the people to reach an agreement, but even if an agreement has been reached, imperialism may still betray and tear up the agreement. Therefore, to prevent the agreement from being undermined, it is also necessary to rely on the resolute struggle of the people.

    The people of China and Korea fought with U.S. imperialism for three years, talked for two years, fought and talked, and fought and talked again. Even in the seven years after the war, they have continued to wage tit-for-tat struggles. It is very clear that imperialism is, after all, imperialism, and its aggressive nature will never change until death. Imperialism, like all reactionaries in history, will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history.

    In the common cause of opposing imperialist aggression, the fighting friendship and internationalist solidarity between the people and armies of our two countries, China and Korea, forged with blood, have been further strengthened and developed. The struggle of the Korean people and the Korean People's Army against U.S. imperialism has not only defended the independence of their own motherland but also safeguarded the security of China, which is a huge support for the Chinese people's socialist peaceful construction. During the years of war, the people's armies of China and Korea fought side by side, closely cooperated, and shed blood together; in extremely difficult and arduous situations, the Korean people always sent the best grain to the Volunteer Army to eat and gave the warm kangs to the Volunteer Army to live in; in order to support the Volunteer Army in combat, the Korean people braved gunfire and bullets, and endured wind, snow, and severe cold, working day and night in the front lines and rear areas. The moving heroic deeds of the great internationalist fighters An Ok-hee and Park Jae-geun, and others, will forever be remembered by the Chinese people and army. After the Korean armistice, the Chinese and Korean armies jointly guarded the 38th parallel, shoulder to shoulder, defending the fruits of victory and preventing the enemy from undermining the armistice. During this period, the Korean people and the People's Army continued to provide the Volunteer Army with strong support and meticulous care, just as they did during the war years. During the process of the Volunteer Army's withdrawal and return to China, the Korean Party, government, people, and army held a nationwide, grand farewell ceremony for the Volunteer Army, pushing the fighting friendship and solidarity between the people and armies of China and Korea to a new peak. In recent years, with the high-speed leap forward in the socialist construction of our two countries, the friendship and solidarity between us have been comprehensively developed and consolidated. We support each other, encourage each other, help each other, and learn from each other. This close-knit solidarity has not only guaranteed victory in the struggle against the enemy but also promoted the development of the socialist construction of our two countries.

    The situation today is very different from what it was ten years ago. The East Wind has further prevailed over the West Wind, and the socialist forces have an overwhelming advantage over the imperialist forces. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger day by day, the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging, and the forces of the people's revolutionary struggles in the capitalist world and the forces of the people of the world in defense of world peace have been unprecedentedly developed. All these forces opposing imperialism, reactionaries, and aggression are further uniting. Under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people are advancing by leaps and bounds along the socialist road at the speed of Chollima, and have achieved great achievements on all fronts of the national economy, and are actively preparing to implement the new and magnificent Seven-Year Plan, a more glorious and brilliant picture of construction has been presented to the Korean people. Under the radiant light of the three red banners of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the Chinese people have also made new and tremendous achievements in all aspects of socialist construction, and are full of confidence in striving to build our country into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in a not-too-long period of time.

    The socialist system determines our country's peaceful foreign policy. We love peace and will never invade other countries. We have always advocated peaceful coexistence with countries with different social systems and easing international tensions; we have always supported the Soviet Union and other socialist countries' peace initiatives on disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons; we have always supported the Korean people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their country and against U.S. aggression and for patriotism; we have always advocated the peaceful resolution of international disputes, and even do not reject negotiations with U.S. imperialism, which occupies our territory of Taiwan, in an effort to resolve the dispute between China and the United States peacefully. Our government has also repeatedly suggested that all countries in the Asian and Pacific region, including the United States, sign a treaty of mutual non-aggression and peace, making this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Our government has consistently adhered to the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Since the beginning of this year, our country has signed treaties of friendship and mutual non-aggression or treaties of peace and friendship with many countries, including Myanmar, Afghanistan, Nepal, and Guinea, on the basis of the Five Principles. Not long ago, our country also signed a border treaty with the Myanmar government, providing an example for the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems. All these eloquently prove that our country has consistently adhered to a peaceful foreign policy and has made unremitting efforts to ease international tensions and prevent a new world war. However, the imperialist camp headed by U.S. imperialism is extremely hostile to the development of socialism and extremely hostile to the growth of national independence and world peace forces. Today, U.S. imperialism not only still occupies South Korea and our territory of Taiwan but also is doing its utmost to strengthen its military bases all over the world and is stepping up its brutal interference and insidious attacks on the national democratic movements and the revolutionary cause of the people of all countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. At the recent session of the United Nations General Assembly, the United States once again stubbornly obstructed the restoration of our country's legitimate rights in the United Nations, refused to discuss the issue of disarmament, and brought out the so-called "Tibetan issue" and "Hungarian issue," deliberately carrying out provocations and poisoning the international atmosphere. All this proves that although U.S. imperialism is facing a situation of decline and collapse, it will never abandon its ambition to dominate the world and enslave the people of all countries. As Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out not long ago at the Pyongyang celebration of the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea: "U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of mankind," "As long as imperialism exists, the source of war will not be eliminated." As long as imperialism exists, there will be soil for the outbreak of wars of aggression. In the face of the danger of war from imperialism, all peace-loving people in the world should be highly vigilant. We firmly believe that in today's world, where the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong and the forces of peace and progress in the world are unprecedentedly powerful, as long as the people of all countries heighten their vigilance, strengthen their unity, and persist in their struggle, it is possible to prevent imperialism from launching a new world war and to maintain world peace. If the aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialism dares to risk the disapproval of the world and launch a war, it will inevitably dig its own grave and accelerate its own demise. This is the inevitable law that does not depend on the will of the aggressors.

    The socialist camp, headed by the great Soviet Union, is a strong bulwark for defending world peace and striving for human progress. To continue to develop and strengthen the forces of the socialist camp, to consolidate and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp, to further carry out the national democratic revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, to carry out the struggle of the proletariat and all working people in capitalist countries against warmongering groups and monopoly capital, to win over all peaceful and neutral countries, to win over all social strata and social figures who oppose imperialism and love peace, to unite these great forces, to form a broad united front, to oppose the war policies and aggressive policies of the imperialist group headed by the United States, to strive to prevent imperialist war, and to defend world peace, and to strive for national independence, people's democracy, and the victory of socialism. This is the common task of the people of all countries in the world, and it is also the common task of the people of China and Korea. I earnestly hope that the people of our two countries will unite more closely and make greater efforts and more contributions to the realization of this common task! (Xinhua News Agency, 25th)

    英勇的斗争　伟大的胜利
    ——中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战十周年为《朝鲜人民军》报而作
    中国人民解放军总参谋长　大将　罗瑞卿
    十年前的今天——1950年10月25日，中国人民的优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军，高举“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的旗帜，跨过鸭绿江，同英雄的朝鲜人民军并肩抗击美国侵略者。现在，时间已经过去了十年，中国人民志愿军在完成了祖国人民给予的光荣任务之后，也早在两年以前，满载朝鲜人民的深情厚谊，全部凯旋归国。今天，当我们和兄弟的朝鲜人民一道，纪念这个光辉日子的时候，回顾我们两国人民在共同对敌斗争中取得的伟大胜利，感到无比的兴奋。
    十年以前，正当朝鲜北部人民致力于国内和平建设的时候，正当中国人民刚刚取得民主革命的胜利、大力进行经济恢复和建设的时候，美国侵略者动员了它三分之一的陆军，五分之一的空军和大部海军，踏着日本帝国主义的老路，悍然发动了大规模的侵朝战争，同时武装侵占了我国领土台湾。美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的狂妄目的，是企图一举灭亡朝鲜，进而侵占中国，以实现其独霸亚洲、称霸世界的狂妄野心。在美国侵略者看来，他们自以为拥有“举世无双”的军事优势，年轻的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是无法抵御其野蛮进攻的；新生的中华人民共和国也是不敢起而抗美援朝的。因此，他们对朝中两国一再提出的警告和和平解决朝鲜问题的建议置若罔闻，并且继续扩大侵略战争，把战火一直烧到中朝边境，同时狂妄叫嚣“在历史上，鸭绿江并不是把（中朝）两国截然划分的不可逾越的障碍”。在这关系着朝中两国安危、关系着亚洲和世界和平命运的严重时刻，朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党领导下，毅然奋起抗战，给了侵略者以当头一棒。随后，中国人民又在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下，掀起轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，以自己的优秀儿女组成志愿军，和朝鲜人民一道抗击侵略者。经过朝中部队并肩奋战，五战五捷，终于把侵略者赶回到三八线附近，并使其损兵折将二十二万多人。这时，美国侵略者那种不可一世的嚣张气焰，才稍有收敛，被迫坐下来和朝中方面举行停战谈判。这个事实，清楚地说明了：当着美国侵略者把战争强加在朝中人民头上的时候，朝中人民是屈服于帝国主义，乞求和平呢？还是勇敢地拿起武器，以正义战争来扑灭侵略战争呢？这是一个严重的抉择。朝中人民在两国党的正确领导下，选择了坚决抵抗的道路，是完全正确的。如果当时我们不坚决以正义的反侵略战争来反对不义的侵略战争，而是采取妥协、投降的方针，那么，后果显然是不堪设想的。同样，在战争打起来以后，如果不把侵略者真正打痛，它也是绝对不会同我们讲和的。
    两年多的朝鲜停战谈判中，每一个有利于实现停战的协议，也都是经过朝中人民的严重斗争换得来的。人们清楚地记得：在停战谈判之初，美国侵略者是多么蛮横！它不仅狂妄地要求索取所谓“海空优势的补偿”，企图不费一枪一弹占领一万二千平方公里的土地；而且当这一无理要求遭到朝中方面坚决拒绝以后，又发动了所谓“机关枪、大炮的辩论”，打算逼迫朝中方面屈服于它的军事讹诈之下。只是在朝中方面坚决给予回击，彻底粉碎了它的夏、秋季攻势，使侵略者遭到比前五个战役还要惨重的损失以后，美国侵略者才重新回到谈判桌上来。在这以后，美国侵略者仍然死不甘心，继续玩弄其反革命的两面手法。一方面，采取无理取闹、逃会等卑鄙伎俩，百般拖延谈判；另一方面，又在战场上拼命进行挣扎，不断发动进攻，甚至灭绝人性地进行细菌战，妄图迫使朝中方面就范。针对侵略者这种阴谋，朝中两国人民军队坚定不移地采用了革命的两手。一方面，在谈判中彻底揭露美国侵略者的丑恶面目，努力寻求达成停战协议的途径；另一方面，更重要的是在战场上坚决给予美国侵略者的进攻以沉重打击。这样，几度濒于破裂的停战谈判，才得以挽救。直到1953年夏季，朝中人民军队发动了强大的反击战，一举突破侵略者四个师的阵地，使战线迅速南移，局势对侵略者极为不利，美帝国主义这才匆忙地要求停战。就这样，经过打打谈谈、以打为主的军事和政治相互交错的斗争，朝中两国人民终于迫使美帝国主义不得不在停战协定上签字认输。朝中人民的伟大胜利，不仅使美国侵略者在军事上遭到惨重失败，保卫了朝鲜的独立和中国的安全，捍卫了社会主义阵营的远东前哨，而且在全世界人民面前戳穿了美帝国主义的纸老虎真相，大大鼓舞了全世界人民反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平、争取民族独立、民主自由和社会主义的斗争。这一伟大胜利，还雄辩地证明：对于帝国主义，必须进行针锋相对的斗争。只有坚决斗争，才能打败侵略，保卫和平。以斗争求和平，才能获得和平；以退让求和平，必然丧失和平。这是一条被毛泽东同志一再阐明过的马克思列宁主义的真理。
    朝鲜停战的实现，是朝中两国人民和全世界爱好和平、主持正义的人民共同赢得的有历史意义的伟大胜利。但是，停战并不意味着美帝国主义从此就放弃侵略野心。谁都知道，美帝国主义是不愿意把朝鲜的停战局面稳定下来，从而使朝鲜问题得到和平解决的。因此，朝鲜停战以后，维护停战协定，并且进一步谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，仍然是一场严重的斗争。七年多来，朝中方面一贯严格地履行了停战协定，并且不断地为朝鲜问题的和平解决作了巨大努力。朝鲜政府曾经一再提出和平统一祖国的方案，并采取了一系列的积极措施。中国人民也一贯地支持朝鲜政府提出的各项建议。两年前，中国人民志愿军为了响应朝中两国政府的和平倡议，促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，全部撤离了朝鲜。朝中两国政府为和平而作的一切努力，得到了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的热烈支持。但是，与此相反，美帝国主义从停战协定签字的那一刻起，就一贯采用各种卑劣手段，破坏停战协定的实施，阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。停战协定的墨迹未干，战争贩子杜勒斯就同李承晚签定了“美、韩共同防御条约”，企图使美国侵略军队长期赖在南朝鲜不走。几年来，美国侵略者不断进行军事挑衅，甚至把原子武器公然运入南朝鲜，并在南朝鲜建立火箭基地。面对着这样的情况，朝中两国人民在努力谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的同时，不能不保持着高度的警惕，不能不对美帝国主义的无耻挑衅和阴谋活动，进行彻底的揭露和坚决的斗争，这才使得美帝国主义破坏停战的阴谋未能得逞。这些事实清楚地告诉我们，不仅同帝国主义进行谈判，需要依靠人民的坚决斗争，才能使谈判取得协议；就是谈判已经达成了协议，帝国主义还是有可能背弃和撕毁协议的。因此，要使协议不致被破坏，也必须依靠人民的坚决斗争。
    朝中两国人民和美帝国主义打了三年，谈了两年，打打谈谈，又打又谈。就是在战后的七年里，仍然不断地进行了针锋相对的斗争。事情十分明显，帝国主义终究是帝国主义，其侵略本性是至死也不会改变的。帝国主义和历史上的一切反动派一样，它是不会自动退出历史舞台的。
    在反对帝国主义侵略的共同事业中，我们中朝两国人民和军队用鲜血凝结成的战斗友谊和国际主义团结得到了进一步的加强和发展。朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，抗击美帝国主义的斗争，不仅保卫了自己祖国的独立，而且也维护了中国的安全，这对中国人民的社会主义和平建设事业是一个巨大的支援。在战争的岁月里，朝中人民军队并肩作战，密切配合，鲜血流在一起；在极端艰难困苦的情况下，朝鲜人民总是把最好的粮食送给志愿军吃，把热呼呼的暖炕让给志愿军住；为了支援志愿军作战，朝鲜人民冒着枪林弹雨，顶着风雪严寒，日夜活动在前线和后方。伟大的国际主义战士安玉姬、朴在根等动人的英雄事迹，更使中国人民和军队永远感念不忘。朝鲜停战后，朝中军队又共同坚守在三八线上，肩并肩地保卫着胜利的果实和防止敌人对停战的破坏。在此期间，朝鲜人民和人民军，仍然像战争年月一样，继续给予志愿军以大力支援和无微不至的关怀。在志愿军撤军回国的过程中，朝鲜党、政府、人民和军队对志愿军的全民性的盛情欢送，把中朝人民和军队的战斗友谊和团结推向了一个新的高峰。近几年来，随着我们两国社会主义建设事业的高速度跃进，我们之间的友谊和团结又获得了全面的发展和巩固。我们互相支援，互相鼓舞，互相帮助，互相学习。这种亲密无间的团结，不仅保证了对敌斗争的胜利，而且促进了我们两国的社会主义建设事业的发展。
    今天的形势已经和十年以前大不相同了，东风进一步压倒西风，社会主义力量对帝国主义力量占了压倒的优势。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营日益强大，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族独立运动正在风起云涌，资本主义世界人民革命斗争的力量和全世界人民保卫世界和平的力量得到了空前未有的发展。所有这些反对帝国主义、反动派和侵略势力的力量，正在进一步联合起来。在朝鲜劳动党和金日成同志的正确领导下的朝鲜人民，正以千里马的速度，沿着社会主义大道突飞猛进，在国民经济的各个战线上都取得了伟大的成就，并且正在积极准备执行规模宏伟的新的七年计划，一幅更加光辉灿烂的建设图景，已经展现在朝鲜人民面前。中国人民在党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，在社会主义建设事业的各个方面，也都取得了新的巨大成就，并且正在满怀信心地争取在不太长的时间内把我国建设成为具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义国家。
    社会主义制度决定了我国的和平外交政策。我们热爱和平，绝不侵略别的国家。我们一贯主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，缓和国际紧张局势；我们一贯支持苏联和其他社会主义国家有关裁军、禁止核武器等和平倡议；我们一贯支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国及反美爱国的正义斗争；我们一贯主张和平解决国际争端，甚至不拒绝同侵占我国领土台湾的美帝国主义进行谈判，力争用和平方式解决中美两国之间的争端。我国政府还一再建议，亚洲和太平洋地区各国包括美国在内签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约，使这个地区成为无核武器的地区。我国政府一贯坚持著名的和平共处五项原则，今年以来，我国同缅甸、阿富汗、尼泊尔、几内亚等许多国家在五项原则的基础上签订了友好和互不侵犯条约或和平友好条约。不久前，我国又同缅甸政府签订了边界条约，更为不同社会制度国家的和平共处，提供了范例。所有这些，都雄辩地证明了我国一贯坚持和平外交政策，为了缓和国际紧张局势，防止新的世界大战，竭尽全力地进行了坚持不懈的努力。但是，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营，却极端仇视社会主义事业的发展，极端仇视民族独立和世界和平力量的壮大。今天，美帝国主义不仅仍然霸占着南朝鲜和我国领土台湾，而且还在全世界各地竭力加强它的军事基地，并且加紧向亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动和各国人民的革命事业实行粗暴的干涉和阴险的进攻。在最近召开的联合国大会上，美国又再一次顽固地阻挠恢复我国在联合国中的合法地位，拒绝讨论裁军问题，搬出所谓“西藏问题”和“匈牙利问题”，蓄意进行挑衅，毒化国际气氛。这一切都证明了美帝国主义尽管它面临着日暮途穷、走向崩溃的困境，但它绝不会放弃称霸世界、奴役各国人民的野心。正如不久以前金日成同志在平壤庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年纪念大会上所指出的：“美帝国主义是人类最凶恶的敌人”，“只要帝国主义存在，战争的根源是不会消除的”。帝国主义存在一天，就有发生侵略战争的土壤。面对着帝国主义的战争危险，全世界所有爱好和平的人民都应该引起极大警惕。我们坚信，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营空前强大、全世界和平和进步力量空前强大的今天，只要各国人民提高警惕，加强团结，坚持斗争，就有可能制止帝国主义发动新的世界大战，维护住世界和平。如果以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团胆敢冒天下之大不韪，发动战争，就必将自掘坟墓、加速自己的灭亡。这就是不以侵略者的意志为转移的必然规律。
    以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营，是保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的坚强堡垒。继续发展和壮大社会主义阵营的力量，巩固和加强社会主义阵营的团结，进一步开展亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反帝国主义的民族民主革命斗争，开展资本主义国家无产阶级和一切劳动人民反对好战集团和垄断资本的斗争，争取一切和平中立的国家，争取一切反对帝国主义、爱好和平的社会阶层和社会人士，把这些伟大的力量联合起来，结成广泛的统一战线，反对以美国为首的帝国主义集团的战争政策和侵略政策，努力制止帝国主义战争，保卫世界和平，争取民族独立、人民民主和社会主义的胜利。这是世界各国人民的共同任务，也是朝中两国人民的共同任务。我热烈希望，我们两国人民更加密切地团结起来，为着实现这个共同任务作出更大的努力和更多的贡献！（新华社25日讯）
