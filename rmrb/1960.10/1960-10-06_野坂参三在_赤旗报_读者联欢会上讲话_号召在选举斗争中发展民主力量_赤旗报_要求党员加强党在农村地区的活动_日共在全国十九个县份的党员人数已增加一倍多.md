Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd - Nosaka Sanzō, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, today addressed the "Akahata" readers' rally, calling on people to exert revolutionary vitality in the election struggle and strive for the leapfrog development of democratic forces centered on the JCP.

More than 30,000 "Akahata" readers gathered today at the Musashino City Stadium in the suburbs of Tokyo to participate in the grand "Akahata" readers' rally. In his speech at the meeting, Nosaka Sanzō pointed out that for more than a year, the Japanese people have launched struggles, successfully prevented Eisenhower from coming to Japan, overthrown the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and forced the Ikeda cabinet to announce the dissolution of the Diet and hold general elections. Nosaka called on the participants to carry through the revolutionary vitality demonstrated in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" into the election struggle, strive for the leapfrog development of democratic forces centered on the JCP, and further strive for the establishment of a democratic coalition government. Nosaka also exposed the deceptive nature of the so-called "National Pension" system that the Ikeda government is trying to implement.

Choirs, dances, Chinese waist drums and other programs were performed at the rally, and various sports programs such as relay races and acrobatic performances were also held. An exhibition of pictures introducing the history of "Akahata" and the struggles of the Japanese people was displayed in the corridor outside the stadium.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 1st - The "Akahata," the organ of the Japanese Communist Party, published an editorial today calling on all party members to strengthen the party's activities in rural areas in order to win over farmers to the progressive forces in the upcoming general election.

"Akahata" said: "It has been pointed out that the biggest shortcoming of the struggle against the revision of the 'Security Treaty' is that not enough farmers participated in the struggle. In order to overcome this shortcoming, the working class and all democratic forces must launch campaigns in rural areas to elect progressive candidates."

"Akahata" continued, "Our party should explain to the farmers that the upcoming general election is very important to the farmers. It is necessary to explain that if the U.S. imperialists and the Japanese reactionaries win the election, they will deprive the vast majority of farmers of their land."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th - According to a report in today's "Akahata," the number of members of the Japanese Communist Party in Ehime Prefecture has more than doubled compared to August of last year. So far, the number of prefectures where the number of JCP members has more than doubled recently has reached nineteen.

The Japanese Communist Party has always stood at the forefront in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality. Its prestige among the people is increasing day by day, its influence is expanding day by day, and more and more people are asking to join the Communist Party. In some counties and factories, the number of party members has increased two or three times.

In order to further strengthen the party's ranks and strive for greater victories in the upcoming general election, local organizations of the Japanese Communist Party are advancing victoriously to complete the goal of doubling the number of party members nationwide.
