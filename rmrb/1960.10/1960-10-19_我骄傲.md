    I am Proud
    [Korean] Piao Zhonglie
    I sweat profusely guarding the electric furnace, day after day guarding this red furnace opening. Ah, it is like the rising sun. Ah, this is the heart of the people of the whole country, united in fiery enthusiasm, this is the boiling, surging heart of the motherland.
    I am proud: I have held the steel bar for several years, I am close to the strong, kind, warm, and enormous heart of the motherland! I offer you my molten steel-like boiling heart – electric furnace!
    Surmounting the peaks of the Five-Year Plan, welcoming years full of glory... Suddenly turning my head, waves of joy surge into my heart, dedicating everything to fight faithfully, we have responded to the Party's call.
    There is only one wish – to create and recreate, one peak after another is trampled underfoot, like pyramids, dazzling and radiant. Ah, I am proud, there is also my share of labor here!
    Everyone is wholeheartedly loyal, with soaring enthusiasm, molten steel pours out of the furnace opening, in that construction song that resounds through the heavens and the earth, how can the songs of steel be limited to just thousands?
    Everywhere there is joyous singing, on the machines that are racing against every second, on the water pumps that are spitting out emerald green river water, on the skyscrapers that pierce the clouds, on the "iron oxen" that gallop across the fields.
    I grip the steel bar even tighter, and I will never let go for eternity, until I climb to the glorious peak of socialism, until I step into the radiant gate of communism!
    We will build a beautiful rainbow bridge – a steel sky bridge, so that millions upon millions of people can sing and dance and walk across it.

    我骄傲
    〔朝鲜〕朴钟烈我汗流浃背守卫电气炉，几年如一日守卫这红红的炉口，它呀，就像那初升的旭日。啊，这是全国人民，火热团结的心，这是祖国滚沸翻腾的心。我骄傲：手握钢钎好几年，我紧挨着祖国坚强、亲切、温暖、巨大的心脏！把我铁水般沸腾的心献给你——电气炉！越过五年计划的高峰，迎接充满光荣的年月……猛回头，阵阵欢喜涌上心头，献出一切忠实地战斗，我们响应了党的号召。只有一个愿望——创造再创造，一座座高峰踏在脚下，有如金字塔，灿烂夺目，啊，我骄傲，这里也有我一份劳
  动！人人赤胆忠心，干劲冲天，铁水滚滚流出炉口，在那响彻天地的建设歌声中，钢铁之歌何止千万首。到处在欢唱，在分秒必争的机器上，在吐着碧绿江水的抽水机上，在耸入云端的高楼大厦上，在驰骋田野的“铁牛”上。我更加握紧钢钎，永生永世也不把手松，直到攀上辉煌的社会主义高峰，直到跨进光芒万丈的共产主义大
  门！我们要架起美丽的虹桥——钢铁的天桥，让千千万万的人载歌载舞，从上面走过。
