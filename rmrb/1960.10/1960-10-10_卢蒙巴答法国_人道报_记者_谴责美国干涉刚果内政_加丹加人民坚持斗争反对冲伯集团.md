Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 8th: "L'Humanité" published this morning Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba's answers to questions from the newspaper's special correspondent in Leopoldville. In his answers, Lumumba condemned the US imperialist interference and aggression in the Congo.

In response to the question of where he believed the main attacks on the legitimate government of the Congo were coming from, Lumumba said that today, "bribery is rampant in the Congo, and the United States is paying for this bribery. Currently, there are attempts to eliminate me by any means, such as bribery and even assassination, because Lumumba is a communist. But I am not a communist, I am a nationalist."

Regarding the role of the United Nations in the Congo, Lumumba replied, "Today it has been proven that certain UN officials are directly providing large sums of money to people hostile to the government. UN command personnel even went inside the barracks to directly distribute money to the soldiers and deliberately refused to cooperate with the legitimate government."

Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: Leopoldville News: The people of Katanga Province in the Congo, regardless of the bloody suppression by the Tshombe clique, bravely persist in their struggle against the Tshombe clique in various places.

According to reports, in the Manono region of northeastern Katanga Province, tribal people opposing the Tshombe clique are in control of the situation. In central Katanga Province, it is reported that when the Tshombe clique's "Minister of Internal Affairs," Munongo's plane landed at Bukama Airport, the Baluba people opposing the Tshombe clique attacked the airport. The Tshombe clique brutally suppressed the people's struggle, frantically massacring patriotic people. According to the Tshombe clique, since August 31, approximately three hundred and fifty people have been killed by the Tshombe's reactionary army.

However, the people of Katanga Province are heroically and unyieldingly further developing their struggle. According to reports, in some areas of the province, patriotic people are fighting the Tshombe clique and resisting the so-called "cleansing" campaign of the Tshombe reactionary army by cutting telephone lines, preventing trains from passing, and dismantling railways.

    卢蒙巴答法国“人道报”记者
    谴责美国干涉刚果内政
    加丹加人民坚持斗争反对冲伯集团
    新华社巴黎8日电　“人道报”今天上午发表了刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴对这家报纸驻利奥波德维尔特派记者的问题的回答，卢蒙巴在回答问题时谴责美帝国主义对刚果的干涉和侵略活动。
    在回答他认为对刚果合法政府的主要攻击来自何方的问题时，卢蒙巴说，今天“在刚果是贿赂风行，为这种贿赂出钱的是美国。目前，有人企图不择手段，例如行贿，甚至暗杀来消灭我，因为卢蒙巴是共产党人。而我不是共产党人，我是民族主义者。”
    在谈到联合国在刚果的作用时，卢蒙巴回答说：“今天业经证明，联合国的某些官员直接把大量的金钱供给敌视政府的人们。联合国军司令部人员甚至跑到军营内部去直接向士兵散发金钱，并蓄意拒绝同合法政府合作。”
    据新华社9日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果加丹加省的人民不顾冲伯集团的血腥镇压，在各地勇敢地坚持反对冲伯集团的斗争。
    据报道，在加丹加省的东北部的马诺诺地区，反对冲伯集团的部族人民控制着局势。在加丹加省中部，据消息说，当冲伯集团的“内政部长”穆农果的飞机在布卡马机场降陆的时候，反对冲伯集团的巴卢巴族人民曾向机场进攻。冲伯集团残暴地镇压人民的斗争，疯狂屠杀爱国人民。据冲伯集团宣布，自从8月31日以来，被冲伯的反动军队杀害的人民已有大约三百五十人。
    但是，加丹加省的人民英勇不屈地进一步发展他们的斗争。据报道，在这个省内的一些地区，爱国人民用割断电话线、阻止火车通行、拆除铁轨等行动来同冲伯集团斗争，抵抗冲伯反动军队的所谓“清洗”运动。
