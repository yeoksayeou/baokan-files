    (I) The Cuban People Don't Want the Yankees
    We warmly celebrate the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cuba. We are thrilled to hear the Cuban people shouting: "We want China, not the Yankees!" This stirring cry has resounded from Latin America all the way to China. This shows how deeply the Cuban people hate their most vicious enemy, U.S. imperialism, and how warmly and lovingly they feel towards brotherly China.
    The U.S. began to invade Cuba in 1898. Cuba was originally a Spanish colony, a well-known West Indian island producing sugar and tobacco (danbajū), which the U.S. had long coveted. That year, taking advantage of Spain's suppression of the Cuban people's revolution, the U.S. used the opportunity and excuse of a U.S. warship sinking in the port of Bai Na to launch what was historically called the "Spanish-American War" against Spain. The U.S. defeated the Spanish fleet and occupied Santiago de Cuba and the eastern part of the island. Later, the two countries negotiated a peace treaty, and Spain was forced to relinquish the entire island of Cuba, formally ceding it to the U.S., which placed it under U.S. military control. After several years, the Yankees organized a main puppet party in Cuba "taking the U.S. as its suzerain and relying on its protection to conduct experimental independent politics." The party leader, under U.S. military supervision, defeated the party "advocating absolute independence" and was elected president of the "new republic." Only then did the U.S., under the pretext of "defending the Cuban revolution, which has been completed," begin a formal troop withdrawal in 1902. At the time of the troop withdrawal, the following treaties were also concluded:
    1. The United States shall not enter into any treaty with foreign powers that may impair the independence of Cuba, nor occupy the island.
    2. The United States shall, in accordance with the Treaty of Paris and the U.S.-Spanish Treaty of Peace, have the right to intervene in the internal affairs of Cuba in order to fulfill its obligations.
    3. The military administration currently in force shall continue to follow the orders issued by the said authorities.
    4. The President of the United States may at any time lease or purchase sites on the island for coal depots and naval anchorages.
    5. Domestic affairs shall be managed with Cuban tax revenue, and no new public debt shall be incurred.①
    To summarize the content of these treaties, in reality, the U.S. would permanently monopolize Cuba, the U.S. would have the right to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs, the U.S. would be able to implement military control in Cuba, and the U.S. would be free to establish military bases in Cuba. The essential spirit of these treaties was to rename Cuba from a Spanish colony to a U.S. colony under a different name, simply changing its nominal designation to "independent and free republic." The only difference between the U.S. and Spain was that the U.S. had an additional set of deceptive disguises. If Spain was a tiger, the Yankees were not only ferocious tigers but also cunning foxes. This was true sixty years ago, and it remains true today, even as they become paper tigers. They have merely replaced the deceptive "independence and autonomy" of sixty years ago with "defending world peace" as a guise for continuing the war. The imperialist nature of aggression will never change.
    The Cuban people, who were directly harmed by such pretense and deception, clearly saw through it at the time. The Chinese workers in Cuba also suffered all kinds of disasters. Domestic Chinese public opinion also commented on this event with insight, pointing out that it "impedes Cuban sovereignty" and that "if Cuba possesses the characteristics of autonomy and persists for a long time, today is like the beginning of a flame or the first gush of a spring; who can stop it?" And it concluded: "Now, we need not ask how the Americans treat Cuba, but rather how Cuba treats itself."② The reason why Cuba is now able to become a country that has achieved unprecedentedly great success in national democratic revolution in Latin America is precisely because the Cuban people are good at "treating themselves," able to "treat themselves" correctly, "overcoming all difficulties and fearing no sacrifice,"③ and have carried out sixty years of heroic struggle against the Yankees.
    In his inaugural address, the Cuban puppet president stated, "Among countries, there are often those who feign recognition of the independence of weak nations, hoping to seek retribution for other countries, while secretly transferring all the rights of that nation to themselves. Only the United States does not harbor such intentions."④ Such disguised and deceptive sweet words, when compared with the U.S. imperialists' sixty years of aggression and atrocities in Cuba and around the world, are completely contradictory and inconsistent. Therefore, it is not difficult to deduce what kind of content the so-called "peace" of U.S. imperialism possesses today.

    (II) Historical Relations Between China and Cuba
    Not long after the U.S. invaded Cuba, a large-scale people's uprising against U.S. control broke out. The Cuban people had already seen clearly at that time that U.S. imperialism had "insatiable desires," "bullying the weak and attacking the foolish," "benefiting itself and harming others," and that it "used violence to oppress uncivilized races, feigning civilization to engage in barbarism."① Such resistance and uprisings rose and fell continuously, lasting until 1959. It is conceivable to what degree the U.S. imperialists' cruel suppression of the Cuban people aroused indignation. Therefore, the Cuban people's rejection of the "Yankees" has both a present and a historical origin, and is by no means accidental.
    The relationship between China and Cuba is not like that. Starting around the 27th year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty (1847), Chinese people began to participate in various productive construction labors in Cuba. According to statistics from the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign (1873), more than 120,000 Chinese had successively devoted themselves to various sugar mills and tobacco fields in Cuba. More than 17,000 people died without landing due to colonialist abuse and persecution, or from illness, drowning, flogging, or suicide, on the way to Cuba. And of the more than 120,000 who landed, more than 70,000 died in Cuban construction sites.② These Chinese, like the native Cubans, suffered the cruel persecution of the Spanish and the Yankees. They used their own blood and sweat to help build Cuba and feed the Yankees. What they were able to obtain was as described in *Miscellaneous Records of Cuba*:
        Get up before the sun rises, and go to
    sleep after midnight. The food is coarse
    grain and plantains, and the clothes are
    short and incomplete. The slightest dis-
    obedience results in punches and kicks,
    or confinement and torture. If they try
    to escape and hide, they will be put to
    death. The cruelty and harshness are
    too numerous to recount.
    In 1898, even food was blockaded by the Yankees and could not be imported, "starving countless overseas Chinese to death." Because of these reasons, many Chinese in Cuba participated in the Cuban revolution from very early on, fighting alongside the Cubans against U.S. imperialism.
    Many stories of Chinese participation in the people's revolution have been circulating in Cuba. A certain Colonel Shang once led six or seven hundred overseas Chinese in battle in the province of Santa Clara. He was later captured due to lack of weapons and heroically gave his life, unyielding until death. A certain captain, under the command of Marshal Mas Mus Ganwei, fought in Santiago, breaking through the enemy's main force in the city. Another route of the Chinese Revolutionary Army fought from Santa Clara province to the eastern province, as if entering an uninhabited land. Chinese people helped the revolution in all aspects. A certain He Dangui, upon his death, was even covered with the Cuban flag by the revolutionaries in Havana, showing the Cubans' respect for him. Another person, Hu De, was much loved by the Cubans. He not only used his business profits to support the Cuban revolution, but also participated in the fighting himself. After success, he continued to run his business, making no demands whatsoever. In addition, the revolutionary forces relied on the connections of a Chinese vegetable grower to break through Santiago. Some peddlers also risked great danger to deliver messages and establish an intelligence network for the revolution.
    General Gonzalo, the leader of the Cuban people's revolution, once praised the Chinese participants at the time, saying: "In the heroic war in Cuba for national independence, the Chinese fought on the battlefield like beasts. They also contributed everything to the uprising war in factories, fields, and hospitals." He also erected a glorious monument for these Chinese revolutionary participants. On it, he wrote: "In Cuba, no Chinese is a deserter, and no Chinese is a traitor." The Chinese in Cuba not only participated in production and construction but also participated in revolutionary battles. Not only did the Chinese and Cubans support each other in the past, but they are still joining hands and working together to oppose the most vicious enemy, U.S. imperialism. This is a strong contrast to the U.S. imperialism's endless exploitation, enslavement, suppression, murder, and other brutal acts against the Cuban people. It further explains why our two peoples have such a deep friendship.

    读书札记

    （一）古巴人民不要美国佬
    我们热烈的庆祝中古两国正式建立外交关系。我们很兴奋的听到古巴人民高呼：“要中国，不要美国佬！”这样激昂的呼声，从拉丁美洲一直响彻到了中国。这说明了古巴人民对最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义，是如何的深恶痛绝，对弟兄般的中国，又是怎样的亲切、热爱。
    美国开始侵占古巴，是1898年。古巴本是西班牙殖民地，是有名产糖和烟草（淡巴菰）的西印度岛，美国早已垂涎了。这一年，就利用西班牙镇压古巴人民革命，美舰在拜那港失事沉没的机会和理由，发动了对西班牙的历史上所谓“美西战争”。美国击败了西班牙舰队，占领了桑德阿哥港及岛的东部。后来两国议和，西班牙被逼把古巴全岛吐出，正式割让给美国，置于美国的军事管制之下。经过数年，美国佬在古巴组织好了“以美国为宗主，赖其保护，以试行独立政治”的主要傀儡政党，党魁并在美国军事监督下战胜了“主张绝对的独立”的政党，当选为“新共和国”总统后，美国才以“保卫古巴革命，已抵于完成”为理由，在1902年开始形式上的撤兵。在撤兵的时候，还订立了这样一些条约：
    1、美国不得与各强国订约破坏古巴的独立及占领该岛。
    2、美国当照巴黎条约、美西和约，有尽其义务以干涉古巴内政之权利。
    3、目下施行军政，仍照该官厅所发之命令。
    4、美国大统领如欲在该岛得有屯煤所及海军停泊处，可随时租之或卖之。
    5、当以古巴岁入款项经营内政，不必另起公债。①
    把这些条约的内容概括起来，实际上就是美国得永久独占古巴、美国有权干涉古巴内政、美国得在古巴实行军事管制、美国得自由在古巴建立军事基地，这些条约的精神实质，就是换汤不换药的规定古巴变西班牙殖民地成为美国殖民地，只是名义上改称为“独立与自由的共和国”罢了。美国和西班牙所不同的，只是多了一套狐外婆的伪装。如果说西班牙是老虎，美国佬就不但是凶恶的老虎，还是狡狯的狐狸，在六十年前是这样，在成为纸老虎的今天，仍然是这样。只是把六十年前骗人的“独立与自主”，改换为“保卫世界和平”，来作为战争继续的幌子而已。帝国主义的侵略本性，是不会有所改变的。
    这样的伪装和欺骗，当时身受其害的古巴人民固然看得清楚，在古巴做工的中国人，也一样的承受着种种灾难。中国国内舆论评述这一事件，也是有会于心的指出“有碍古巴主权”，“使古巴具自主之特性，历久不衰，则今日正如火之始炎，泉之始达，谁能阻之？”并归结到：“今不必问美人待古巴如何，亦视古巴之自待如何耳”②。古巴现在所以能成为拉丁美洲取得民族民主革命空前巨大成就的一个国家，正是古巴人民善于“自待”，能以正确的“自待”，“排除万难，不怕牺牲”③，对美国佬进行了六十年英勇斗争的结果。
    古巴傀儡总统就职时演说，称“各国中往往有佯认弱国独立，冀为他国图报，而暗将该国权利尽归于己者，惟美国则不存此意”④。这样伪装的、骗人的甜言蜜语，和美帝国主义六十年来在古巴、在全世界的侵略暴行对照起来，是完全相反、完全不符合的。那么，美帝国主义今天之所谓“和平”，究竟具有怎样的内容，就更不难推断了。

    （二）中国和古巴的历史关系
    美国佬侵占古巴以后，不久就爆发了反对美国控制的大规模的人民起义。古巴人民当时就已看清楚了美帝国主义有“无餍足之欲望”、“兼弱攻昧”、“利己损人”，对“未开化人种，以暴力压之，假文明之面，行野蛮之事”。①这样的反抗和起义，不断起伏，一直持续到1959年。美帝国主义对古巴人民残酷镇压到如何令人愤慨的程度，也就可以想见了。所以，古巴人民不要“美国佬”，有现实的原因，也有历史的渊源，决不是偶然的。
    中国和古巴的关系却不是这样。大约从清朝道光27年（1847）开始，中国人就有在古巴参加各种生产建设劳动的。据同治12年（1873）统计，先后已有十二万多中国人，投身在古巴糖寮、烟地各处。还有一万七千多人，由于在到古巴的途中，遭受殖民主义者虐待和迫害，或病死、或溺死、或被鞭挞死、或自杀死，没有登岸。而上岸的十二万多人，也前后有七万多死在古巴工地。②这些中国人，和古巴本地人一样，承受着西班牙佬、美国佬的残酷迫害。他们用自己的血汗、辛勤地帮助建设了古巴，也喂饱了美国佬。他们所能得到的，却如《古巴杂记》里所说：
        日未出而起，夜过半而
    眠。所食粗粟大蕉，所穿短褐不
    完。稍有违命，轻则拳打足
    踢，重则收禁施刑。或私逃隐
    匿，则置之死地。狠毒苛刻，擢
    发难数。
    而在1898年，甚至粮食也被美国佬进行了封锁，不得进口，“饿毙华侨不知其数”。就由于这种种原因，在古巴的中国人，从很早起，就有很多参加了古巴革命，和古巴人并肩作战，以反对美帝国主义。
    在古巴，流传着许多中国人参加人民革命的故事。有一个商上校，曾经在山得客拉纳省，领导过六、七百名华侨作战，后来因没有武器接济被擒，英勇就义，至死不屈。有某上尉，在马斯务甘未元帅指挥下，在山地亚作战，攻破了该城敌人的主力。还有一路华侨革命军，由山得客拉纳省战至东省，一路如入无人之境。中国人从各个方面帮助了革命。有一个何丹桂，他后来逝世时，加连拿的革命党人，甚至用古巴国旗盖在他的棺上，可见古巴人对他的敬重。又有一个胡德，很受古巴人爱戴，他不但以经商所得的资财接济古巴革命，自己还参加队伍作战，功成后，仍旧去经营他的商业，什么样的要求都没有。此外，如革命力量攻破山地亚，也依靠了一个种菜的华侨关系。还有一些小贩，为革命冒着极大危险，传递消息，建立情报网。
    古巴人民革命的领袖冈萨洛将军，曾经这样表扬当时中国的参加者：“在古巴争取民族独立的悲壮的战争中，中国人像猛兽一样在战场上搏斗。他们也在工厂、田地和医院中，为起义战争贡献了一切”。还为这些中国的革命参加者，建立了光荣的纪念碑。上面由他写了：“在古巴的中国人，没有一个是逃兵，没有一个是叛徒。”中国人在古巴，不但参加了生产建设，还参加了革命战斗，不但过去中国人和古巴人互相支援，现在也还是共同携手，共同反对最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义。这和美国佬对古巴人民不尽的剥削、奴役、镇压、杀害等等残暴行为比较起来，正是很强烈的对照。也更进一步地说明了我们两国人民为什么有着这样深厚的友谊。
