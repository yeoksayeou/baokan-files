    Song of Going to the Countryside
    Li Xue'ao
    A long, long dragon of people,
    A hubbub in the police station.
    The household registration comrade, face full of smiles,
    Writing words and stamping seals—
    Agricultural production is the foundation,
    City residents vie to go to the countryside!
    The very first in line,
    Is from our printing factory.
    Don't underestimate him as a printing worker,
    He's also skilled at repairing farm tools:
    "Please transfer my household registration,
    I'll go to the countryside to set up a factory!"
    The second in line,
    Is Section Chief Zhao from the Management Bureau.
    He has fought north and south for twenty years,
    His head of white hair is completely frosted:
    "The whole family is moving to the countryside,
    To fight on the agricultural front!"
    The third in line,
    Is respected Auntie Wang,
    Who just came from the countryside last year,
    And is praised for her diligence and thrift in managing the household.
    "I've long wanted to go back to my old home,
    My hands are itching from not doing farm work!"
    The fourth in line,
    Wears a school badge on her chest.
    Don't underestimate her small size,
    Her voice is louder than anyone else's:
    "I want to learn from Xing Yanzi,
    To write articles on the face of the earth!"
    …
    A long, long dragon of people,
    The household registration comrade is very busy.
    Each stroke writes out surnames and given names,
    Each stamp imprints red ideology.
    Joyfully watching the hundreds of flowers fly in the Jin City,
    Each and every one landing in the fields!

    下乡曲
    李学鳌一条人龙长又长，派出所里闹嚷嚷。户警同志满脸笑，又写字来又盖章——农业生产是基础，城里居民争下乡！队伍前面头一名，来自我们印刷厂。别看是个印刷工，修造农具也在行：“请你给我转户口，我到农村办工厂！”队伍前面第二名，管理局的赵科长。南征北战二十年，满头白发尽染霜：“全家搬到农村去，农业战线去打仗！”队伍前面第三名，人人尊敬的王大娘，去年才从乡下来，勤俭持家受夸奖。“我早就想回老家去不干农活手发痒！”队伍前面第四名，胸前带着校徽章。别看个子长的小，嗓门却比谁都强：“我要学习邢燕子，地球上面写文章！”……一条人龙长又长，户警同志多繁忙。笔笔写出姓和名，章章印出红思想。喜看锦城百花飞，朵朵落在田野上！
