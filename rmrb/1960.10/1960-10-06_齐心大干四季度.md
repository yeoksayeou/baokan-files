    Go All Out in the Fourth Quarter

    The fourth quarter has begun. The broad masses of workers on the industrial front are filled with ambition and determination to achieve a larger increase in production in the final three months. The Second Steelmaking Plant of Taiyuan Iron and Steel provides a good experience for winning this victory. This is: vigorously promote the spirit of communist cooperation, "three shifts as one furnace, mutual great cooperation." The No. 7 furnace, which first implemented this approach, has been leading the factory in all indicators since May this year; after the factory promoted this experience, the daily steel production level increased by 61.36%. Open-hearth furnaces, electric furnaces, converters, blast furnaces, coke ovens, coal mines, etc. are all in continuous production. If we further strengthen the cooperation between shifts, the production level of steel, coal, etc. will inevitably be greatly improved.

    Enterprises should promote this spirit of cooperation between various links within the enterprise, and relevant enterprises should also promote this spirit. Steel production in the fourth quarter will definitely increase significantly, which requires a significant increase in the production of all links such as coal, iron, ore, and transportation, and requires the workers of these enterprises to cooperate closely with steel plants. Send as much iron as the steel plant needs; send as much ore and coke as the iron plant needs; send as much coal as the coking plant needs; deliver it whenever it is needed. All enterprises related to these links, such as machinery factories, refractory material factories, and forestry farms producing pit props, must also arrange their own production with a spirit of great cooperation. In this way, steel plants can freely increase production and move forward by leaps and bounds. The reason why pig iron production in Yunyang County, Sichuan Province, has risen so sharply is that the workers in the mines, coking plants, and transportation departments have promoted the spirit of great cooperation, ensuring that the small blast furnaces have sufficient "food and supplies."

    How can we improve cooperation between enterprises and between various links within enterprises? The key lies in establishing collectivist thinking and a global perspective. Cooperation is a concrete manifestation of the superiority of the socialist economy. The socialist public ownership of the means of production determines that the relationship between our various enterprises and between various links within enterprises is a brotherly relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation. When people's thoughts more correctly reflect this relationship, and when people's collectivist thinking and global perspective are greatly promoted, the superiority of the socialist economy can be fully utilized. Moreover, only when the overall work is done well can the local work be done well. When each shift proceeds from the interests of the entire furnace, and while striving for high output in its own shift, it also creates favorable conditions for the next shift, the production of the entire furnace will increase, and the production of each shift will be smoother. When the steel production of our entire country is increased, coal mines and iron mines can get more mechanical equipment, the transportation department can get more steel rails, vehicles, and ships, and all walks of life can improve their technical equipment level and expand their production capacity more quickly.

    The cooperation between our enterprises and between various links within enterprises has always been very good. When striving for a larger increase in steel production in the fourth quarter, everyone will definitely cooperate better, and the spirit of communist great cooperation will exert greater power!

### 齐心大干四季度

    齐心大干四季度
    第四季度开始了。工业战线的广大职工满怀雄心壮志，决心在最后的三个月里实现生产更大幅度的增长。太钢第二炼钢厂为夺取这一胜利提供了一个很好的经验。这就是：大兴共产主义协作之风，“三班为一炉，互相大协作”。首先实行这一作法的七号炉，从今年5月份以来，各项指标一直在厂内遥遥领先；全厂推广这一经验以后，钢的日产水平提高61.36％。平炉、电炉、转炉、高炉、炼焦炉、煤矿等都是连续生产的，如果都进一步加强各班之间的协作，钢、煤等的生产水平必然会大大提高。
    企业内部各个环节之间要发扬这种协作精神，各个有关企业之间也要发扬这种精神。第四季度钢产量定将大幅度地增长，这就要求煤、铁、矿、运等所有环节的生产也都大幅度地增长，要求这些企业的职工同钢厂紧密协作。钢厂需要多少铁，就送去多少铁；铁厂需要多少矿石、焦炭，就送去多少矿石、焦炭；焦厂需要多少煤，就送去多少煤；什么时候要，就什么时候运到。所有和这些环节有关系的企业，像机械厂、耐火材料厂、生产坑木的林场等，也都要以大协作的精神安排自己的生产。这样，炼钢厂就可以放手增产，大踏步地前进。四川省云阳县生铁产量上升得这样猛，重要的原因就是因为矿山、焦厂和运输部门的职工发扬了大协作的精神，保证了小高炉“粮草”充足。
    怎样才能搞好企业之间、企业内部各环节之间的协作呢？关键在于树立集体主义的思想，树立全局观点。协作是社会主义经济优越性的一种具体表现。社会主义的生产资料公有制决定我们各个企业之间、企业内部各个环节之间的关系，是兄弟般互助协作的关系。当人们的思想越是正确地反映了这种关系、当人们的集体主义思想和全局观点越是大大发扬的时候，社会主义经济的优越性就越能充分发挥。而且，只有当整体的工作搞好了，局部的工作才能搞好。当各个班都从全炉的利益出发，在争取本班高产的同时，又处处为下一班创造有利条件的时候，全炉的生产上去了，每个班的生产也就更加顺利了。当我们整个国家钢的产量提高了以后，煤矿、铁矿就可以拿到更多的机械设备，运输部门就可以拿到更多的钢轨、车辆和轮船，各行各业都可以更快地提高自己的技术装备水平，扩大自己的生产能力。
    我们企业之间和企业内部各个环节之间的协作，一向是很好的。在第四季度力争钢产量更大幅度地增长的时候，大家一定会协作得更好，共产主义大协作的精神定将发挥更大的威力！
