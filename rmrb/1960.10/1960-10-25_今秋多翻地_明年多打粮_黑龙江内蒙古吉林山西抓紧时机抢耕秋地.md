Heilongjiang Combines Autumn Harvest and Autumn Plowing
    Xinhua News Agency: Rural people's communes and state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province are concentrating large numbers of tractors and new-style animal-drawn farm implements to rush to plow land that has just been harvested, in preparation for spring plowing and production next year. At present, more than 22 million mu of land have been plowed throughout the province.
    In light of this year's heavy rainfall in Heilongjiang Province, the anticipated delay in the autumn harvest, the early onset of freezing, the pressing need for time to plow, and the shortage of labor and livestock, various regions made comprehensive arrangements before the autumn harvest, making ample preparations in terms of labor, machinery, and other aspects. Various regions have generally adopted a phased assault method, combining the autumn harvest with autumn plowing. When labor is concentrated on harvesting, most of the livestock and tractors are used for plowing; when the autumn harvest is busy, some livestock and machinery are drawn away for transportation and threshing, but plowing work continues uninterrupted; when transportation is basically completed, the livestock and machinery are concentrated to rush to plow before freezing. The Songhua River area, where harvesting has now basically ended, is rushing to complete the end of the autumn harvest and picking grain and threshing, while concentrating more than 20,000 sets of mechanized and semi-mechanized farm implements for plowing, with a daily progress of more than 220,000 mu. The state-owned Friendship Farm dispatched a large number of tractors and has completed more than half of its plowing plan. Boli County concentrated more than 80% of its livestock on plowing at the beginning of the autumn harvest, and when it needed to concentrate more livestock on transporting grain, it had already plowed more than 40%; at present, the county still maintains more than 57% of its livestock to continue plowing, achieving simultaneous pulling, threshing, plowing, and sowing.
    In order to accelerate the progress of autumn plowing, various regions have paid close attention to maximizing the efficiency of agricultural machinery and tools. Hailun County, one of the province's major grain-producing counties, adopted the method of double-shift operation of tractors, greatly improving plowing efficiency. The Haixing Commune has one set of tools and two teams of people, working day and night in two shifts, deploying a total of 560 plows, and plowing more than 18,600 mu of land in three days. Baiquan County, with a higher degree of mechanization, deployed more than 200 tractors and more than 1,000 new-style animal-drawn farm implements, and promoted the Xingnong Commune's four-to-the-field method of refueling, adding water, repairing, and handing over shifts, with one tractor plowing more than 80 mu of land per shift, an increase of more than 80% in efficiency compared to the past, and also achieved leveling and harrowing.

Inner Mongolia Has Plowed More Than 20 Million Mu of Autumn Land
    Xinhua News Agency: People's communes in various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, while engaged in intense autumn harvesting, are properly arranging labor, livestock, and tools, and launching an autumn cultivation and deep plowing campaign to lay a good foundation for striving for a bumper summer harvest next year. As of October 4th, the region's autumn cultivation and deep plowing area has reached more than 23 million mu, and some land has been fertilized with base fertilizer.
    This year, the autonomous region's autumn cultivation work started early, was grasped tightly, and the quality was greatly improved compared to last year. Before autumn cultivation, people's communes in various places summarized the experience of increased production gained from autumn plowing last year, which enabled the vast number of commune members to further recognize the benefits of autumn plowing and greatly boosted their enthusiasm. They put forward the slogan "Cut a piece, plow a piece, plow as you cut," to complete this year's autumn cultivation and deep plowing task with guaranteed quality and quantity. Many people's communes have adopted methods such as pairing strong with weak, pairing large with small, training scattered livestock, and having pastoral areas support agricultural areas in the use of livestock, greatly tapping the potential of plowing livestock to promote the progress of autumn cultivation and deep plowing. The Ulanqab League has completed 83% of its autumn cultivation area through the above methods, of which 30% has reached the requirement of deep plowing of more than seven inches. Xinghe County has generally achieved the requirements of light pulling, deep plowing, and smooth turning by modifying double-share plows and step plows.
    In the autumn cultivation and deep plowing campaign, various places have established and improved the responsibility system for the use and feeding of draught animals and the acceptance of plowing, and many communes have also launched appraisal competitions to improve plowing technology.

Jilin Strives to Complete the Plowing Plan Before Freezing
    Xinhua News Agency: After completing the harvesting of major autumn crops ahead of schedule, Jilin Province has taken advantage of the victory to launch a massive autumn plowing campaign. As of October 15, the province's autumn plowing area reached more than 5 million mu, of which more than 1 million mu of land was deep-plowed with tractors. The depth is mostly around six to seven inches, and continuous operations of fertilization, plowing, harrowing, and rolling have been achieved.
    This year, the number of tractors put into agricultural production throughout the province increased by 75% compared to last year. At the beginning of the autumn plowing, various places, in the spirit of everything serving agriculture, transferred all tractors engaged in transportation, sideline industries, and other production to the agricultural front to participate in the autumn plowing campaign. This year, various new-style plowing tools such as double-wheeled double-share plows and double-wheeled single-share plows have also greatly increased compared to last year. Fuyu, Changling, Yushu, and other counties have trained more than 10,000 new draught animals for autumn cultivation. Various places have also made full use of the original old-style plowing tools, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining "machines, horses, and cattle," preparing material conditions for completing the autumn plowing plan before freezing.
    People's communes throughout the province have generally used the method of dividing lines for combat and phased assaults, establishing autumn cultivation professional teams, and implementing the "three specials" (special personnel, special livestock, special tools) and "eight fixations" (fixed personnel, fixed livestock, fixed tools, fixed land plots, fixed quality, fixed quantity, fixed remuneration, fixed leadership) responsibility system, so that autumn cultivation, autumn harvest, and other work are carried out in an orderly manner. People's communes in the Baicheng area established autumn cultivation brigades based on management areas, unifiedly organizing manpower, livestock, and tools, implementing a complete set of tools and continuous operations, and achieving a "one-stop" process for fertilization, plowing, and harrowing.
    During this year's autumn cultivation, various places paid special attention to summarizing and applying the experience of autumn plowing in the past two years, and constantly improving the quality of autumn plowing operations. Changchun, Baicheng, Siping, and other regions have universally promoted the experience of "double plows" for plowing, with 60%-70% of the deep-plowed land reaching a depth of six to seven inches or more.

Shanxi First Universal Plowing, Then Re-Plowing: Both Fast and Good
    Xinhua News Agency: Shanxi Province has fully launched an autumn cultivation upsurge from north to south. At present, the province has plowed more than 7.1 million mu of autumn land. In the faster-progressing Jinbei area, the autumn land plowed as of the 15th accounted for 32% of the area that should be plowed, and the depth generally reached five to seven inches. The Jinnan area, where the autumn harvest is the latest, has also greatly accelerated the progress of autumn cultivation compared to previous years due to sufficient preparations in advance and the widespread promotion of the experience of phased work, cross-plowing, and hoeing before plowing in cotton fields.
    In response to the situation of large autumn cultivation areas and tight time this year, people's communes in various places specifically calculated three accounts of land, labor, livestock, and time in advance, and organized experienced cadres, technicians, and veteran farmers to go deep into the fields to study autumn cultivation plans that were more, faster, better, and more economical based on different crop maturity periods, climate, soil, and other natural conditions. Generally, mountain land, distant land, shady land, and sticky land are plowed first, followed by ditch land, near land, sunny land, and sandy land; universal plowing is done first, followed by re-plowing, so autumn cultivation is carried out quickly and well.
    Various places have vigorously promoted the role of livestock in autumn cultivation and improved the efficiency of livestock use. Zuo Yun County, based on the experience of the Nanbali Management Area of the Weiyuan Commune, changed the past practice of draught animals not resting at noon and ending early in the afternoon, and implemented the method of a large rest at noon and frequent grazing, so that livestock could quickly recover their strength. In this way, the average daily plowing progress of each animal increased from three mu to five mu.

    今秋多翻地　明年多打粮
    黑龙江内蒙古吉林山西抓紧时机抢耕秋地
    黑龙江秋收秋翻结合进行
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省各地农村人民公社和国营农场正在集中大批拖拉机和新式畜力农具，在刚收割过庄稼的土地上突击翻地，为明年春耕生产作好准备。目前，全省已耕翻出二千二百多万亩地。
    黑龙江省各地根据今年雨水大，秋收时间将推迟，结冻将提早，翻地时间紧迫，劳畜力不足等情况，在秋收前就统筹安排，从劳力、机具等方面作了充分准备。各地普遍采取分段突击办法，把秋收与秋翻地结合起来。在劳动力集中收割的时候，大部分畜力和拖拉机用来进行翻地；秋收大忙，部分畜力和机械抽出去拉运、打场时，翻地工作仍然不停；等到拉运基本结束，再把畜力和机械集中起来，抢结冻前的时间突击翻地。现在收割已经基本结束的松花江地区，正在一面突击秋收结尾和拣粮、打场，一面集中两万多台（件）机械化和半机械化农具翻地，日进度达到二十二万多亩。国营友谊农场出动大批拖拉机，已完成翻地计划一半以上。勃利县在秋收一开始，就集中了80％以上的畜力翻地，等到需要集中更多畜力拉地送粮时，已翻出40％以上；目前全县还保持着57％以上的畜力继续翻地，做到拉、打、翻、种并进。
    为了加快秋翻进度，各地十分注意发挥农机具的效率。全省主要产粮县之一海伦县，采取了拖拉机双班作业的办法，使翻地效率大大提高。海兴公社一套工具两套人马，日夜两班作业，共出动五百六十副犁，三天就翻出一万八千六百多亩地。机械化程度较高的拜泉县，出动了二百多台拖拉机、一千多副新式畜力农具，推广了兴农公社守林管理区的加油、加水、修理、交接班四到田的办法，一台拖拉机一个班次翻八十多亩地，比过去提高效率80％多，还做到了整平耙净。
    内蒙古已翻秋地二千多万亩
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区各地人民公社在紧张秋收的同时，妥善安排劳力、畜力、工具、展开秋耕深翻运动，为争取明年夏季丰收打好基础。到10月4日，全区秋耕深翻面积已达二千三百多万亩，并有部分地施了底肥。
    今年自治区秋耕工作动手早，抓得紧，质量也比去年有很大提高。各地人民公社在秋耕前，都总结了去年秋翻地获得增产的经验，使广大社员进一步认识到秋翻地的好处，大大鼓舞了干劲。他们提出：“割一片，耕一片，随割随耕”的口号，要保质保量地完成今年秋耕深翻的任务。许多人民公社在畜力的使用上，采取了以强配弱，以大配小，调教散畜和牧区支援农区的办法，大挖耕畜潜力，以促进秋耕深翻的进度。乌兰察布盟通过上述办法，到现在已完成秋耕面积83％，其中30％达到深翻七寸以上的要求。兴和县由于改装双铧犁和步犁，一般都达到拉轻、耕深、翻平的要求。
    在秋耕深翻运动中，各地建立和改进了役畜使用饲养和翻地验收等责任制度，许多公社还展开评比竞赛，改进耕翻技术。
    吉林力争封冻前完成翻地计划
    据新华社讯　吉林省在提前完成大秋作物的收割任务之后，又乘胜掀起一个千军万马的秋翻地运动。到10月15日止，全省秋翻地面积达五百多万亩，其中用拖拉机深耕的土地达一百多万亩。深度大部分都在六至七寸左右，并且做到了施肥、耕地、耙压连续作业。
    今年全省投入农业生产的拖拉机比去年增加了75％。秋翻地一开始，各地就本着一切服从农业的精神，将从事运输、副业等其它生产的一部分拖拉机全部调到农业战线，参加秋翻地运动。今年秋翻地中双轮双铧犁、双轮单铧犁等各种新式耕地工具也比去年大大增加。扶余、长岭、榆树等县为秋耕训练了一万多头新役畜。各地还充分利用原有旧式耕地工具，做到土洋并举，“机、马、牛”相结合，为结冻前完成秋翻计划准备了物质条件。
    全省各地人民公社普遍运用分线作战，分段突击的办法，建立秋耕专业队，实行“三专”（专人、专畜、专工具）、“八定”（定人、定畜、定工具、定地块、定质、定量、定报酬、定领导）的责任制度，使秋耕、秋收等工作进行得井井有条。白城专区各人民公社以管理区为单位建立秋耕大队，统一组织人力、畜力和工具，实行工具配套，连续作业，作到了施肥、翻地、耙压等工序“一条龙”。
    今年秋耕过程中，各地特别注意总结和运用过去两年秋翻地的经验，不断提高秋翻作业质量。长春、白城、四平等地区普遍推广两副犁“套翻”的经验，深耕地60％—70％达到六至七寸深以上。
    山西先普耕后复耕既快又好
    据新华社讯　山西省由北向南全面掀起了秋耕热潮。目前全省已经耕翻了七百一十多万亩秋地。进展较快的晋北地区，到15日止已耕秋地占到了应耕面积的32％，深度一般达到了五至七寸。秋收最晚的晋南专区，由于事先准备充分，秋耕开始以后又普遍推广了分段干、交叉犁和棉田内先锄后翻的经验，秋耕进度也比往年大大加快。
    各地人民公社针对今年秋耕地面积大、时间紧的情况，事先具体计算了土地、劳力畜力、时间三笔账，并且组织有经验的干部、技术员和老农深入田间，根据不同作物成熟期、气候、土质等自然条件，因地制宜地研究了多、快、好、省的秋耕方案。一般都是先耕山地、远地、背阴地、粘土地，后耕沟川近地、向阳地、沙土地；先普耕后复耕，因而秋耕进行得既快又好。
    各地大力发挥牲畜在秋耕中的作用，提高了牲畜的使用效率。左云县根据威远公社南八里管理区的经验，改变了过去耕畜中午不休息下午早结束的做法，实行了中午大休息、勤放草的办法，使牲畜能够迅速恢复体力。这样，平均每天每头牲畜的耕地进度由三亩提高到了五亩。
