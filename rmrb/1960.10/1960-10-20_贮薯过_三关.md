    Storing Sweet Potatoes Through the "Three Barriers"
    Everyone says sweet potatoes are difficult to store, but our commune's Changying Brigade can eat fresh sweet potatoes year-round. The Changying Brigade's good sweet potato storage is mainly due to tightly grasping the "harvesting and transporting, putting into cellars, and management" three barriers. The harvesting and transporting requirements are: when cutting vines, remove all sweet potato leaves; when digging, the nail rake should go deep and be placed steadily, without hard dragging; when harvesting sweet potatoes with a plow, plow deep and straight, without damaging the sweet potato tubers; when storing, do not pile them up in large piles, and do not throw them onto the pile from afar; when transporting sweet potatoes, load the carts lightly, pad the carts with some sweet potato vines, unload the carts gently, and do not use rakes to unload; seed sweet potatoes should be transported directly back in baskets. The requirements for putting them into cellars are: there should be a dedicated person in the cellar to receive the baskets, gently pour out the baskets, and do not step on the sweet potatoes; do not fill the cellar too full, generally reaching 70% of the capacity. In terms of management: the ten to fifteen days after entering the cellar are the key period for management, and also the period for removing moisture and preventing heat; keep the cellar temperature between nine and fifteen degrees Celsius. After the key period, take appropriate measures to strengthen the management of the sweet potato cellar according to the changes in cold, hot, windy, and snowy weather.

    贮薯过“三关”
    都说甘薯不好贮藏，可是我们公社常营大队常年都能吃到鲜薯。常营大队甘薯贮存的好，主要是紧紧抓住“收运、下窖、管理”三道关。收运的要求是：割蔓时去净薯叶；刨时钉钯下的深、放的稳，不硬拖；用犁收获甘薯时要犁得深，犁得直，不伤薯块；存放不堆大堆，不老远往堆上扔；运薯时，轻装车，车上垫些薯蔓，轻卸车，不用钯子卸；留种的薯块直接用筐运回。下窖的要求是：窖内有专人接筐，轻倒筐，脚不踩在薯上；装窖不要装得太满，一般达到容量的70％。管理方面：入窖后的十到十五天是管理的关键期，也是去湿防热期，窖内温度保持在摄氏九度到十五度以内。关键期后，按冷、热、风、雪天气的变化，采取适当措施加强薯窖管理。
