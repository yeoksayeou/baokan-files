Taking Grain as the Key Link, Rationally Arranging Labor Force
    -- Main Experiences in Labor Force Arrangement and Utilization in Zhangshi People's Commune, Guangdong Province
    Beijing Agricultural University, Department of Agricultural Economics, Zhangshi People's Commune Investigation Team
    Guangdong's Zhangshi People's Commune is a semi-mountainous area surrounded by mountains on three sides with a plain in the middle. It has 83,723 mu of cultivated land and 11,182 laborers, with each laborer responsible for an average of 7.5 mu of cultivated land and 12.7 mu of sown area.  Few laborers and abundant land, coupled with inconvenient transportation due to its location in the mountainous and hilly areas, have brought certain difficulties to the development of agricultural production.

    With the high-speed leap forward of the national economy and the continuous consolidation and development of the people's communes, the depth and breadth of production have greatly increased, and the labor force allocation ratio has also undergone significant changes in recent years. The direction of change is: a large increase in labor force transferred from agriculture to state and commune industrial and mining enterprises, from grain production to diversified operations, and from the production front line to the logistics departments. Of course, this transfer of labor force also has its necessity, which has promoted the comprehensive leap forward of agricultural production and rural work. However, such a transfer has made the labor force on the front line of agricultural production very strained.

    How to rationally arrange the labor force and do a good job in grain production has become the most urgent problem to be solved by this commune. The commune party committee did not only see the difficult side of few laborers and heavy tasks, nor did it simply calculate the "dead reckoning" of "how many mu can one person cultivate," but rather boldly mobilized the masses, fully believing in the masses' dynamic role and creativity. They first summarized the experiences of production development in recent years and found the best key to solving this problem, which is that all undertakings of the commune must revolve around agriculture, especially grain production, as the central link. Only by concentrating the main force on developing agriculture and grain can the policy of diversified operations be realized, and other undertakings can have a source of water and a foundation of wood.

    The Zhangshi Commune Party Committee has adopted the following effective measures to resolve the contradiction between production development and labor shortage.

    Concentrate Labor Force to Strengthen the First Line of Agriculture

    The commune party committee decided to transfer labor force from all aspects and concentrate its use to strengthen the first line of agriculture.  After extensive airing of views, big debates, recalling the past, comparing accounts, and adopting a series of effective measures, a total of 2,723 laborers were cleared out, of which 2,180 were directly put into the first line of field production.  This increased the labor force in field production from 53.5% of the total labor force to 81%. Thus, not only was the largest labor force concentrated on the front line, but also the strong labor force on the front line accounted for more than 70%. In order to ensure the labor force required for the front line, the commune also strictly stipulated the authority and scope of labor force use at all levels, stipulating that the commune should not use more than 5% of the labor force during busy farming seasons, and the brigade should not exceed 2%, which ensures that the production team uses 93% of the labor force, and more than 80% even during the slack farming season.

    Correct Use of Labor Force is Key to the Production Team

    The production team is the most basic combat unit for grain production. Whether it can be ensured that more than 80% of the labor force is engaged in field production during the busy farming season depends on the rational arrangement and correct use of the production team. If the commune only takes measures to strengthen a large number of laborers to the front line, but the production team does not use them correctly, and the good steel is not used on the cutting edge, then even if the number of laborers increases, agricultural production cannot be done well. The Dazhuyuan Production Team of Heping Brigade in this commune is the best example in terms of rational labor arrangement. The Dazhuyuan Production Team has a total of 36 laborers, and more than 90% are used for weeding and fertilizing rice, and planting and managing sweet potatoes, and it is done with reasonable division of labor and clear responsibilities. The entire labor force is rationally used, and auxiliary labor force is also utilized.  Due to the rational arrangement of the labor force, the team's production has been very outstanding.

    Seize the Season, Flexible Dispatch,
    Guarantee the Basics, Take Care of Others

    In order to ensure the implementation of the policy of "taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations," there must be an appropriate ratio in the distribution of labor force. This ratio is a fixed ratio, but also a flexible ratio. Saying that it is a fixed ratio means that once the ratio is set, it must be followed, and first of all, we must try every means to ensure that more than 80% of the labor force is put into the first line of field production. Saying that it is a flexible ratio is because rural production is seasonal, field labor has busy and slack seasons, and commune industries and sideline occupations have peak and off-peak seasons, which requires flexible allocation of labor force with agriculture as the center, and the ratio and division of labor cannot be too rigid. The experience of Zhangshi Commune is mainly carried out from the following two aspects:

    First, with agricultural production as the main focus, flexibly dispatch the labor force of commune-run industries and diversified operations. The commune-run industries of this commune, adhering to the spirit of small-scale during busy farming seasons, large-scale during slack farming seasons, no activity during peak seasons, farming during busy seasons, working during slack seasons, and being both workers and farmers, closely revolve around agricultural production. This year, when rushing to harvest early rice and rush to transplant late rice in June, the labor force of commune-run industries and other undertakings fully invested in the "double rush" assault campaign, thus ensuring that the "double rush" tasks could be completed on time, with quality, and with quantity. They also adopted the combination of professional teams and mass assault, and the combination of long-term preparation and short-term assault to solve the contradiction between grain production and diversified operations. For example, the Baisha Brigade formed a professional team of 480 people, which was flexibly dispatched according to the needs of the agricultural season. During the slack farming season, they carried out diversified operations and basic construction activities, and during the busy farming season, they participated in field production. For example, during the slack farming season last winter, a large number of laborers were concentrated on the mountains to carry out short-term (five to ten days) assault campaigns for felling trees and cutting bamboo, and earned about 80,000 yuan at one time. When field production is tight, this professional team returns to the production team to participate in field production; during the slack farming season, it organizes professional teams to engage in diversified operations such as livestock farms, vegetable teams, and processing plants. In the first half of this year alone, the income from these three items reached more than 30,000 yuan. In the entire process of agricultural production, it is divided into three situations according to the degree of busyness of each quarter: large, medium, and small. When agricultural work is slightly busy, the field production tasks are completely completed by the field production team, and no other forces are mobilized. When agricultural work is moderately busy, in addition to the field production team, a part of the force is organized to support it. When agricultural work is very busy, the field production tasks are mobilized by the whole people and go all out to organize all possible forces to complete the assault. This not only guarantees the labor force required for agricultural production, especially grain production, but also guarantees the development of diversified operations.

    Second, with grain crops as the main focus, flexibly dispatch the labor for economic crops. During the key period of grain production, such as the busy season of spring plowing, this commune adopts the method of advancing or postponing the labor for various economic crops to stagger the agricultural work, so as to ensure that the superior forces are used to grasp grain production. For example, when applying fertilizer and weeding early rice, it is the busy season for intertillage and weeding of peanuts. In order to solve this contradiction, peanuts are planted early in the rainy season, and rice is also sown during the Awakening of Insects. This adjusts the busy and slack seasons and ensures the planting of both crops.

    Arrange Crop Stubble, Actively Adjust Busy and Slack Seasons

    The seasonality of agricultural production is the strongest. Therefore, there will be an uneven distribution of busy and slack seasons and tight and loose times in the use of labor force. In each region, during the sowing and harvesting seasons of their main crops, there will always be busy periods with a high concentration of agricultural work, resulting in a shortage of labor. The solutions they have found are: (1) Grasp early. Part of the agricultural work during the busy season is done early during the slack season. For example, before the Spring Festival, the winter fallow fields are plowed and harrowed; and during the winter preparation for farming, more than 50% of the labor force is concentrated on accumulating fertilizer to prepare sufficient fertilizer for early rice in the following year. During the spring plowing season, we concentrate our efforts on tidying up rice seedling fields, harvesting winter crops, plowing and harrowing, so as to ensure early transplanting of early rice and not missing the farming season. (2) Arrange the early, middle, and late varieties of crops in proportion to adjust the agricultural work stubble. This is a two-season rice production area, and June, when early rice is harvested and late rice is transplanted, is the busiest period of the year. Based on past experience, this year, each production team planted varieties with different maturity periods. The earliest maturity accounted for 20%, the middle and early maturity accounted for 50%, and the later maturity accounted for 30%. In this way, the early rice harvest started ten days earlier than in the past, and the combination of early, middle, and late varieties can plan to harvest early rice while tidying up the fields and transplanting late rice, adjusting the agricultural work stubble. At the same time, due to the batch planting and batch maturity, each production team can free up its hands to support each other, which greatly alleviates the labor tension. For example, winter wheat used to be generally sown at the Beginning of Winter, and the harvest in the second year was squeezed together with the transplanting of early rice. Now, early-maturing wheat is sown in advance during the Frost's Descent, and late-maturing wheat is postponed to 4-5 days after the Beginning of Winter. The harvest work in the second year can be arranged before and after the transplanting of rice. The early-maturing wheat is harvested, followed by the transplanting of rice, and the late-maturing wheat field is just reserved for the late-season rice seedling field, which staggers the busy work stubble. There are many similar arrangements throughout the year, and the key lies in making long-term plans and clever arrangements.

    Adapt to Local Conditions, Make Clever Layouts

    Making clever layouts in production according to local conditions can greatly save labor force. The methods adopted by Zhangshi Commune are: First, change distant fields to near fields. On the one hand, land planning adjustments were carried out between teams, relatively reducing the remote fields of each team. For example, the 1,200 mu of remote fields transferred out by Luokeng Brigade originally required commune members to walk eight miles at the nearest and forty miles at the farthest to work in the fields; after the adjustment, the Shangxia Yao Brigade could plant locally, reducing the labor consumption for round trips. On the other hand, fertilizer pits are established in remote fields to accumulate, manufacture, and apply fertilizer on the spot. In arranging winter planting, more green manure is planted in remote fields and plowed on the spot to save transportation. By establishing fertilizer bases in remote fields, coupled with sending refined fertilizer to remote fields, the labor for transporting fertilizer is greatly saved. At the same time, during the busy farming season, people and cattle are organized to go to the mountains and set up camps in remote fields, which also greatly saves labor in round trips. Second, configure a production line. For example, wineries, sugar factories, and food processing plants are established near the grain processing plant, and pig farms are set up near these plants; in this way, in addition to the comprehensive utilization of products, rice for feed is first processed to make maltose, sugar residue is then used to make wine, and finally used as feed. Because raw materials and feed are used nearby, labor force is also saved. Third, rationally deploy production bases. With the development of diversified operations, the commune has established a network of commodity production bases. These bases are located in places with abundant natural resources and have opened up transportation conditions. For example, a commodity production base for timber and local specialties is established in the mountainous Luokeng Brigade, and a highway is built by Luokeng through the entire commune to the Beijiang River. In the Baisha Brigade along the Beijiang River, where water transportation is convenient and the soil is suitable, fruit tree and nursery production bases are established; aquatic product bases are developed in areas where fish and shrimps are abundant in the Beijiang River, and fruits, fish, and shrimps can be directly transported out by water. At the same time, the commune-run farm, which specializes in breeding fine varieties (rice varieties, pig breeds) for the commune, is located in the central area of the commune. Cadres' meetings and commune members' market trips can conveniently bring back fine varieties. Judging from the transportation of 300,000 catties of fine rice varieties and a part of excellent pig breeds supplied to major brigades in 1959 alone, the labor saved is very considerable.

    One Specialization, Multiple Concurrent Jobs, Skilled Workers Return to the Team

    The way to solve the shortage of labor force is to rationally arrange the existing labor force on the one hand, and further tap the potential of the labor force on the other hand. Tapping the potential of the labor force not only means an increase in the number of labor force, but more importantly, an increase in the utilization rate of the labor force and the continuous growth of labor productivity. The experience of Zhangshi Commune is:

    First, extensively mobilize the masses to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements. This is the central link to improve labor productivity. Since 1958, this commune has saved a lot of workdays through various reforms such as all grain being processed by water power, all canteens being supplied with tap water, making ox carts, horse carts, and handcarts, adding wooden tracks, aerial transport lines, wooden sailboats, and self-made grain threshing machines and harvesters.

    Second, vigorously promote comprehensive utilization of labor force, and advocate one specialization with multiple concurrent jobs, one specialization with multiple skills, and one person with multiple uses around agricultural production. Canteen managers mostly serve concurrently as cooks and storekeepers; cooks also concurrently engage in pig raising, chicken raising, vegetable planting, and firewood collecting in the canteen. This not only saves labor force, but also develops the comprehensive operation of the canteen, which is of great help to improving the lives of commune members. For example, the Yuanchang Production Team canteen of Heping Brigade, due to the implementation of comprehensive utilization of labor force, the canteen and production team sideline personnel were reduced from seven to five, which can use the labor force most reasonably and economically. The livestock farm feeders not only raise the livestock well, but also carry water, collect manure, plant feed land, and cut green grass, and some feeders also take the time to open some land to plant vegetables and peanuts. During the busy farming season, some feeders are also contracted to participate in field production, achieving both livestock farming and agriculture.

    Third, in the utilization of labor force, use people according to their talents, assign work according to their abilities, give full play to everyone's strengths, and improve labor efficiency. For example, Wang Bing'e, a skilled chicken raiser, was assigned to do farm work in the past and only accounted for half a labor force. After the implementation of skilled workers returning to the team, one person raised more than 1,400 chickens, accounting for four or five people. By transferring people who are good at handicrafts from doing physical work back to the team, the efficiency of doing work has been greatly improved, and labor force has been saved. For example, the nursery of Liukeng Brigade used to have 17 fixed people. After the implementation of skilled workers returning to the team, the experienced old farmers returned to their original positions, and as a result, only seven people managed the nursery very well.

    Due to the firm implementation of the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation" and "taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations," and the rational arrangement of labor force, Zhangshi Commune has achieved brilliant achievements in agricultural production. The economic life of the entire commune presents a new look: the commune's income increases year by year, the lives of commune members are greatly improved, grain production grows at a high speed, diversified economies take off together, and a large amount of grain products support national construction. This is a great victory for the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and also a great victory for the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation" and "taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations."

    以粮为纲　合理安排劳动力
    ——广东省樟市人民公社劳动力安排与使用的主要经验
    北京农业大学农业经济系樟市人民公社调查组
    广东樟市人民公社是一个三面环山，中间平原的半山区，共有耕地八万三千七百二十三亩，劳力一万一千一百八十二人，每个劳力平均负担的耕地七点五亩，负担播种面积十二点七亩；劳力少，土地多，再加上地处山区丘陵交通运输不便，这些都给发展农业生产带来一定的困难。
    随着国民经济的高速度跃进及人民公社的不断巩固和发展，生产的深度和广度也就大大地增加了，几年来劳动力投放比例也发生了很大的变化。变化的方向是：劳动力由农业转移到国家和公社的工矿企业，由粮食生产转移到多种经营，由生产前线转移到后勤部门的大为增多。当然，这种劳动力的转移也有它的必要性，它促进了农业生产和农村工作的全面跃进。但是，这样的转移，就使农业生产第一线的劳动力显得很紧张。
    如何合理安排劳动力，搞好粮食生产，成为这个公社最迫切需要解决的问题。公社党委没有只看到劳动力少、任务大的困难一面，也没有专门去算“一个人能种几亩地”的死账，而是放手发动群众，完全相信群众的能动作用和创造性。他们首先总结了几年来生产发展的经验，找到了解决这个问题的最好钥匙，这就是公社的各项事业必须围绕农业，特别是粮食生产这个中心环节进行。只有集中主要力量发展农业，发展粮食，才能实现多种经营的方针，其他各项事业才是有源之水，有本之木。
    樟市公社党委采取了以下各种有效措施，解决生产发展和劳动力不足的矛盾。
    集中劳力，加强农业第一线
    公社党委决定从各方面抽调劳动力，集中使用，加强农业第一线。经过大鸣、大放、大辩论，回忆、算账对比，并采取了一系列的有效措施，共清出了二千七百二十三个劳动力，其中有二千一百八十人直接投入田间生产第一线。使田间生产的劳动力由原来占总劳力53.5％，增加到占总劳力81％。这样，不但保证第一线集中了最多的劳动力，而且第一线上精壮劳动力也占70％以上。为了保证第一线所需的劳动力，公社又严格规定各级使用劳动力的权限和范围，规定农忙时公社使用劳动力不超过5％，大队不超过2％，这就保证小队使用的劳动力达93％，在农闲时也在80％以上。
    正确使用劳力，关键在于小队
    生产小队是粮食生产最基层的战斗单位。能否保证在农忙季节有80％以上的劳动力从事田间生产，关键在于小队的合理安排和正确使用。如果只是公社采取措施，把大批劳动力加强到第一线，而小队没有正确使用起来，好钢没有用在刀刃上，那么，即使劳动力数量有所增加，也不能把农业生产搞得很好。这个公社的和平大队大竹园小队在合理安排劳动力方面就是一个最好的例证。大竹园小队共有三十六个劳动力，用于水稻耘锄、追肥，白薯的栽插管理就占90％以上，而且做到分工合理，责任明确。整劳动力得到合理使用，辅助劳动力也都利用起来。由于合理安排了劳动力，使该队生产搞得很出色。
    抓住季节，灵活调度，
    保证基础，兼顾其他
    为了保证“以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营”方针的贯彻，在劳动力的分配上必须有一个恰当的比例。这个比例，是死比例，也是活比例。说它是死比例，就是比例一旦订出，必须按比例办事，首先是想尽一切办法保证80％以上的劳动力投入田间生产第一线。说它是活比例，是因为农村生产有季节性，田间劳动有忙有闲，公社工业和副业有旺季和淡季，也就要求以农业为中心灵活地调配劳动力，比例和分工不能过死。樟市公社的经验主要从以下两方面进行：
    一是以农业生产为主，灵活调度社办工业和多种经营的劳动力。这个公社的社办工业本着农忙小搞、农闲大搞、大忙不搞，农忙务农、农闲做工、亦工亦农的精神，紧紧围绕农业生产进行。今年6月抢收早稻、赶插晚稻时，社办工业和其他事业的劳力全力投入“双抢”突击运动，从而保证“双抢”任务能够按时、按质、按量完成。他们还采用专业队和全民性突击相结合、长期准备和短期突击相结合的方法，来解决粮食生产和多种经营的矛盾。如白沙大队组成四百八十人的专业队，根据农事季节的需要，灵活调配。在农闲时开展多种经营和基本建设活动，农忙时参加田间生产。如去冬农闲季节，集中了大批劳力上山，大搞短期（五至十天）伐木、砍竹的突击运动，一次就收入八万元左右。这支专业队伍在田间生产紧张时，就回到小队参加田间生产；农闲时又抽出组织专业队，从事畜牧场、蔬菜队、加工厂等多种经营，今年上半年仅这三项收入就达三万元之多。在整个农业生产的过程中，又根据各季度农忙的程度不同，分成大、中、小三种情况，农活小忙时田间生产任务完全依靠田间生产队完成，不动其他方面的力量，农活中忙时田间生产任务，除了田间生产队担负外，还组织一部分力量来支援；农活大忙时，田间生产任务，则全民动员，全力以赴，组织一切可以组织的力量突击完成。这样既保证了农业生产，特别是粮食生产所需的劳动力，又保证了多种经营的开展。
    二是以粮食作物为主，灵活调度经济作物的用工。这个公社在粮食生产关键时期，如春耕生产大忙季节，对各种经济作物用工，采用提前或推后的办法，错开农活，以保证用优势兵力抓好粮食生产。如在早稻追肥耘田时，正是花生中耕除草的繁忙季节，为了解决这个矛盾，把花生提早在雨水种植，水稻亦于惊蛰播种，这样做，调剂了忙闲，使两种作物的种植都有了保证。
    安排作物茬口，主动调剂忙闲
    农业生产的季节性最强。因而，在劳动力使用上也就会产生忙闲不均、时紧时松的现象。各个地区在其主要农作物的播种和收获季节，总会出现农活高度集中的大忙时期，产生劳力不足的困难。他们解决的办法是：（1）抓早。把大忙时期的一部分农活提早在农闲做好。如在春节以前就把冬闲田犁完、耙完；并在冬季备耕时，集中50％多的劳力大搞积肥，备足次年早稻的肥料。到春耕生产季节，就集中力量整理秧田，进行冬作物的收获及犁耙，保证了早稻早插，不误农时。（2）有比例地安排好作物早、中、晚品种，调开农活茬口。这里是两季水稻产区，早稻收获和晚稻插秧的6月是一年里最忙的时期，根据历年的经验，今年在各小队种植了成熟期不同的品种，最早成熟的占20％，中早的50％，较晚的30％，这样，早稻开割较过去提早十天，而且早、中、晚不同品种的搭配，就能有计划地边收早稻，边整田，边插晚稻，调开了农活茬口。同时，由于分批栽插，分批成熟，使各小队又可以腾出手来互相支援，这样就大大缓和了劳动力紧张状况。又如，冬小麦过去一般在立冬播种，第二年收获正和早稻插秧挤在一起，现在把早熟小麦提前在霜降播种，晚熟小麦又推到立冬后4—5天，第二年收获工作就能够安排在插秧的前后，早熟麦收了，接着插秧，晚熟麦地正好留作晚造秧田，这样就错开了大忙活茬。一年之中，诸如此类的安排还很多，关键就在于长作计划、巧作安排。
    因地制宜，巧作布局
    生产上因地制宜地巧作布局，就可以大大地节省劳动力。樟市公社采取的办法是：一、变远田为近田。一方面，在队与队之间进行了土地规划调整，相对地减少了各队的边远田。如罗坑大队调出的一千二百亩边远田，原来社员下地干活最近要走八里，最远达四十里；经过调整后，上下瑶大队就可以就地种植，减少了往返耗工。另一方面，在远田建立田头粪坑，就地积、就地制、就地施。在安排冬种上，远田多种绿肥，就地耕翻，节省运输。通过建立远田的肥料基地，再加上对远田送精肥，运肥用工就大大节省。同时还在农忙季节，组织人牛上山，在远田安营扎寨，也大大节省了往返途中费工。二、配置一条龙。如在粮食加工厂附近建立酿酒厂、糖厂和食品加工厂，在这些厂的就近又设立猪场；这样，除了产品可以综合利用外，像作饲料的稻谷，先进行加工，制麦芽糖，糖渣又酿酒，最后当饲料。由于原料和饲料就近利用，也就节省了劳动力。三、合理部署生产基地。由于多种经营的开展，该公社已建立了商品生产基地网。这些基地都设立在自然资源充足的地方，并开辟交通运输条件。如在山区罗坑大队建立木材、土特产商品生产基地，同时由罗坑修筑公路，通过整个公社直到北江河。在沿北江河水运交通方便且土质适宜的白沙大队，建立果树和苗圃生产基地；在北江河盛产鱼虾地带发展水产基地，果品、鱼虾就可以由水路直接运出。同时，把专为公社繁殖良种（稻种、猪种）的社办农场，设立在公社的中心地区，干部开会和社员赶集都可顺便带回良种，仅就1959年供应各大队水稻良种三十万斤和一部分优良猪种的运输来看，节省的劳动力就十分可观。
    一专多兼，能手归队
    解决劳动力不足的途径，一方面是对现有劳动力进行合理安排，另一方面是进一步挖掘劳动力的潜力。挖掘劳动力的潜力，不但意味着劳动力数量的增加，更重要的是劳动力利用率的提高，劳动生产率的不断增长。樟市公社的经验是：
    一、广泛发动群众开展技术革新、技术革命运动。这是提高劳动生产率的中心环节。这个公社自1958年以来，通过粮食全部实行水力加工，食堂全部自来水化，制牛车、马车、手推车，增设木轨道、空中运输线、木帆船，自制打禾机、收割机等各项改革，可以节省很多工作日。
    二、大搞劳动力综合利用，提倡围绕农业生产的一专多兼，一专多能，一人多用。食堂管理员大部兼任炊事员，保管员；炊事员又兼搞食堂养猪、养鸡、种菜、打柴。这样做不但节省了劳动力，也发展了食堂的综合经营，对改善社员生活有很大作用。如和平大队元昌小队食堂，由于实行了劳动力的综合利用，结果食堂和小队副业人员由七人减为五人，这样做就能最合理最经济地运用劳动力。畜牧场饲养员不但养好牲口，而且也把担水、起粪、种饲料地、刈青草等活捎带着干，并且有的饲养员还抽空开一些地种蔬菜花生，在农忙季节也紧缩一部分饲养员参加田间生产，做到了亦牧亦农。
    三、对劳动力的利用，做到因材使用，因人给事，充分发挥每个人的特长，提高劳动效率。如养鸡能手王炳娥，过去分配她干农活，只顶半个劳动力，实行能手归队后，一人就养了一千四百多只鸡，顶上四、五个人。由于将善于做手艺的人，从做出力活中抽调归队，大大提高了做活效率，节省了劳动力。如留坑大队苗圃过去固定十七人，实行能手归队后，有丰富经验的老农又回到自己原来岗位上了，结果只要七个人就把苗圃管理得很好。
    樟市公社由于坚决贯彻了“以农业为基础”和“以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营”的方针，合理安排了劳动力，在农业生产上取得了光辉的成绩。全社的经济生活呈现出崭新的面貌：公社收入年年增加，社员生活大大改善，粮食产量高速度增长，多种经济比翼高飞，并且以大量的粮食产品支援了国家建设。这是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大胜利，也是“以农业为基础”和“以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营”方针的伟大胜利。
