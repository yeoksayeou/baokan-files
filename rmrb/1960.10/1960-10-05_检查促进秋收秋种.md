    Inspect and Promote Autumn Harvesting and Planting
    Conducting several inspections each year is an important leadership method of our Party. On the agricultural front, the most important inspections to be carried out each year are the spring inspection and the autumn inspection. The main content of the spring inspection is spring sowing and field management, and the main content of the autumn inspection is autumn planting and autumn harvesting. Conducting universal and in-depth inspections during these two seasons, seizing the key points, and vigorously promoting progress will have a significant effect on improving the level of agricultural production and the level of leadership work.
    Now is the most intense season for autumn harvesting and planting. In addition to the frequent presence of many leading cadres at the grassroots level, many provinces, cities, and counties have also formed various work groups, inspection groups, or work teams and inspection teams to work on the front lines of autumn production. After the Party issued the call to vigorously develop agriculture and vigorously develop grain production, conducting in-depth inspections during the new upsurge of increased production and frugality in the vast rural areas is of particular significance.
    The main purpose of the inspection is to more timely discover, summarize, and promote the new experiences that have emerged in the new upsurge, and to more timely understand, analyze, and solve the new problems that have emerged in the new situation, learning while promoting progress. The activities of work groups and inspection groups, closely coordinated with the work of leading cadres who are deeply rooted at the grassroots level and fixed in one place for a long time, can further strengthen the leadership force on the agricultural front. Leading cadres who are deeply rooted at the grassroots level, in various types of regions and units, over a long period of time, have learned many situations, summarized many experiences, and established closer ties with the masses. Through universal and in-depth inspections, these good things can be concentrated, so that the exchange of experiences, understanding of situations, strengthening of collaboration, and mutual promotion between this region and that region, between advanced units and backward units, between various industries, and between cadres at all levels can be carried out more quickly and effectively. With these two methods working together, the depth and breadth of the mass movement for increased production and frugality on the agricultural front can be improved simultaneously, both deeply and meticulously, and vigorously and extensively.
    Inspection is one of the leadership methods of the mass line. It is a way of "going to the masses" and also a way of "coming from the masses." The comrades participating in the inspection work, on the one hand, deliver the Party's guidelines and policies more directly and widely to the broad masses, and on the other hand, absorb fresh experiences and opinions more directly and widely from the broad masses. In this way, the Party's guidelines and policies can be made more in line with various different practical situations and implemented more correctly and deeply into actual work.
    Inspection is also a way for leading cadres and the broad masses to be more closely integrated. In the inspection work, cadres at all levels and representatives of commune members, together, delve into all aspects and processes of collective production and collective life, work together in the fields, eat together in the canteen, inspect and discuss at the same time, making it easier to meet minds and exchange opinions. The inspection we advocate is not only the higher level inspecting the lower level, and cadres inspecting the masses, but it is also the lower level inspecting the higher level, the masses inspecting the cadres, and also mutual inspection at the same level, and mutual inspection among the masses. Checking up and down at all levels and discussing at all levels can both promote everyone's creativity and initiative, and enhance everyone's sense of responsibility and combat effectiveness.
    What is the content of the autumn inspection? Autumn planting mainly involves checking the acreage, checking the targets, and checking the measures. Autumn harvesting mainly involves checking the experience, checking the yield, and checking the distribution. The two common points are: checking whether it is timely, and checking whether sufficient labor has been allocated. At the same time, it is also necessary to check how life is arranged and how labor and rest are combined. It is necessary to go directly to each production unit to see the crops, the land, and the people. To check whether the autumn planting area has been implemented, it is necessary to see where the main crop land is, where the early crop land is, where the replanted land is, where the late crop land is, where the high-yield plots are, where the general fields are, and where the reserved spring planting land, cotton fields, and oil crop land are, etc. To check whether the labor force and leadership force have been implemented, it is necessary to see how many people are currently working in their respective positions, and what kind of people they are, etc. In the inspection, it is necessary to pay attention to comparison and analysis, and use the spirit of "breaking the casserole and asking to the end" to find out the fundamental experience and key issues. In some cases, "small things" and "small problems" can also become key, and grasping them can greatly increase production and frugality, while neglecting them can become major loopholes. Many things related to the rationalization of the production process, some things related to seed treatment and variety matching, may seem like small things, but grasping them can play a big role. In the inspection, it is necessary to be good at discovering and solving such experiences and problems.
    What is the standard for this inspection? It is whether the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation has been implemented, that is, the requirement of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain production, that is, mobilizing the whole Party and mobilizing the whole people to invest the maximum manpower, material resources, and leadership force into agricultural production and grain production. It is necessary to see how much force has been used on the front line of production, and to see how much force other lines have used to cooperate with and support the front line; it is necessary to see whether the enthusiasm and style of the cadres on the front line are in line with the spirit of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain production, and to see how many specific problems related to vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain production they have helped the masses solve. The planting area, the measures for increasing production, and the quality of cultivation must all reach higher standards than in previous years according to the requirements of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain production.
    The inspection work must be closely integrated with production activities, and the inspection must start from the beginning and continue to the end in the entire process of autumn harvesting and autumn planting, until all the autumn harvests are collected, distributed, and stored well, and until all the autumn planting plans are completed. This year, the planned area for autumn planting in various places has been expanded. To thoroughly complete the autumn planting plan, it is still necessary to mobilize greater forces to make major efforts and meticulously solve many specific problems. Now the season is approaching the Cold Dew (October 8), and there are only ten days left until the Frost's Descent (October 23). During this period, it is particularly necessary to strengthen inspections and fully promote progress, so as to ensure that autumn harvesting and autumn planting do not miss the opportunity and are completed well from beginning to end.

### 检查促进秋收秋种

    检查促进秋收秋种
    一年进行几次检查，是我们党的一个重要的领导方法。在农业战线上，每年要进行的几次检查，最重要的是春季检查和秋季检查。春季检查的主要内容是春播和田间管理，秋季检查的主要内容是秋播和秋收。在这两个季节进行普遍深入的检查，抓住关键大力促进，对于提高农业生产水平和提高领导工作水平都有重大的作用。
    现在正是秋收秋种最紧张的季节，许多省、市、县除了经常有许多领导干部深入基层之外，又组成了各种工作团、检查团或工作组、检查组，到秋季生产第一线去工作。在党发出了大办农业、大办粮食的号召之后，在广大农村掀起的新的增产节约高潮中，进行深入的检查，更有特别重要的意义。
    检查的主要目的，就是更及时地发现、总结和推广在新高潮中出现的新经验，更及时地了解、分析和解决在新形势下出现的新问题，一面学习，一面促进。工作团、检查团的活动，同深入基层长期固定在一个地方的领导干部的工作，密切配合起来，就能使农业战线的领导力量进一步加强。深入基层的领导干部，在各种类型的地区和单位，在较长的时期中，了解了许多情况，总结了许多经验，同群众建立了更密切的联系。通过普遍深入的检查，就可以把这些好东西集中起来，使这个地区和那个地区之间，先进单位和落后单位之间，各行各业之间，各级干部之间，更迅速更有效地交流经验、了解情况、加强协作、互相促进。这两种方式配合起来，农业战线增产节约的群众运动的深度和广度就能够同时提高，既深入细致，又波澜壮阔。
    检查是群众路线的领导方法之一，它是“到群众中去”的一种方式，也是“从群众中来”的一种方式。参加检查工作的同志们，一方面把党的方针、政策更直接更广泛地交给广大群众，一方面更直接更广泛地从广大群众中吸收新鲜的经验和意见。这样，就能使党的方针、政策更加切合各种不同的实际情况，更正确更深入地贯彻到实际工作中去。
    检查也是领导干部和广大群众更密切地结合起来的一种方式。在检查工作中，各级干部和社员代表一起，深入集体生产、集体生活的各个方面和各个过程，一起在田间劳动，一起在食堂吃饭，一边检查、一边讨论，思想更容易见面，意见更容易交流。我们提倡的检查并不只是上级检查下级，干部检查群众，它同时也是下级检查上级，群众检查干部，又是同级互相检查，群众互相检查。上上下下层层检查、层层讨论，既能发扬每个人的创造性和积极性，又能提高每个人的责任心和战斗力。
    秋季检查的内容是什么？秋种，主要是查面积、查指标、查措施。秋收，主要是查经验、查产量、查分配。共同的两条是：查是否及时，查是否调足了劳动力。同时还要检查生活如何安排，劳逸如何结合。要直接到各个生产单位去看庄稼、看地、看人。查秋种面积是否落实，就要看看正茬地、早茬地在那里，回茬地、晚茬地在那里，丰产方在那里，一般田在那里，预留的春播地、棉田、油料地在那里，等等。查劳动力和领导力量是否落实，就要看看各方面正在各自的岗位上劳动和工作的各有多少人，都是什么样的人，等等。在检查中要注意比较和分析，用“打破砂锅问到底”的精神，找出根本经验和关键问题。在有些情况下，“小事情”“小问题”也会成为关键，抓住了就能大大增产节约，疏忽了就会成为大的漏洞。像有关生产过程合理化的许多事情，有关种子处理和品种搭配的一些事情，看起来似乎都是一些小事情，但抓准了就能起很大作用。在检查中要善于发现和解决这样的经验和问题。
    这次检查的标准是什么？就是是否贯彻执行了以农业为基础的方针政策，就是大办农业、大办粮食的要求，也就是全党动员，全民动员，用最大的人力、物力和领导力量投入农业生产、粮食生产。要看究竟有多少力量用到了生产第一线，要看其它各线对第一线用了多大力量配合和支援；要看在第一线的干部的干劲和作风是不是合乎大办农业、大办粮食的精神，要看他们帮助群众解决了多少有关大办农业、大办粮食的具体问题。播种面积，增产措施，耕作质量，每一项都要根据大办农业、大办粮食的要求达到更高的标准，超过往年。
    检查工作必须紧密结合生产活动，在秋收、秋种的全部过程中，从头检查起，一直检查到底，直到秋季收获物全部收好分好藏好，直到秋种计划全部完成。今年各地的秋种计划面积都扩大了，彻底地完成秋种计划，还须动员更大力量作重大的努力，并且细致地解决许多具体问题。现在时令已近寒露（10月8日），离霜降（10月23日）只有十多天时间了。在这期间，特别要加强检查，全力促进，务求秋收、秋播不失时机，善始善终。
