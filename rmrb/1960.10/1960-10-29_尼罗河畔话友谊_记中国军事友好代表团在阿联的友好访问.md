	Talking Friendship on the Banks of the Nile
	—A Record of the Friendly Visit of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to the United Arab Republic
	Liu Kaichen
	On the banks of the Nile, the sky is clear and the clouds are white. The blue and blue date trees are heavily laden with purplish-red and orange-yellow fruits. The land of the United Arab Republic is beautiful. The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation, headed by General Zhang Zongxun, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, paid a friendly visit to this beautiful country from September 26 to October 23 at the invitation of Field Marshal Amir, Vice President and Minister of Defense of the United Arab Republic.

	The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation visited the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the United Arab Republic, military factories and civilian factories, and also visited schools and places of interest in the United Arab Republic, bringing the friendship of the Chinese people and army to the people and army of the United Arab Republic. The Chinese guests were warmly received and welcomed by the people and army of the United Arab Republic. On October 11, President Nasser of the United Arab Republic received the delegation and had a friendly conversation with the members. President Nasser said that the visit of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation would further enhance the friendship between the people of China and the United Arab Republic.

	During the visit, the delegation had cordial conversations with the generals of the armed forces of the United Arab Republic. They expressed their gratitude for the support given by the Chinese people during the United Arab Republic's resistance to imperialist armed aggression in 1956. Ali Amir, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the United Arab Republic, said: "During the crisis of the Suez Canal incident in 1956, the Chinese people gave moral and material assistance to the United Arab Republic, which left a deep impression on the minds of the people of the United Arab Republic." General Zhang Zongxun said at a banquet in Cairo: "Both China and the United Arab Republic have suffered from long-term rule and oppression by imperialism and colonialism. The people of both countries have gone through hardships and carried out long-term heroic struggles to liberate their motherlands from dire straits. The Chinese people have always supported the just struggle of the people of the United Arab Republic against imperialism. The Chinese people and army admire the heroic spirit shown by the people and army of the United Arab Republic in the struggle against imperialist armed aggression in 1956. In the days of your glorious battle, we were cheered by your victory. In the struggle against imperialist aggression and safeguarding national independence, the Chinese people will always be the most loyal and reliable friends of the Arab people, the African people, and all the people in the world who are striving for national independence."

	The Army, Navy, and Air Force of the United Arab Republic gave special performances for the Chinese guests. The physically strong soldiers caught snakes and hedgehogs in the desert, skinned them and roasted them over a fire, and ate them in just two minutes. This arduous training is to cope with the possible situation of running out of food in desert combat. Naval soldiers who had only been enlisted for two weeks performed some basic light weapons drills. Students from the anti-aircraft artillery school held live ammunition exercises by the sea and finally shot down a small radio-controlled plane. Students from the flying school gave a wonderful stunt performance. They also used twenty-five planes to form the three English letters "CAF" (Chinese Air Force) and flew over the stands where the Chinese guests were sitting; later, they used fifteen planes to form a pyramid shape and soar in the sky, expressing the friendship between the people and air forces of China and the United Arab Republic. These performances were warmly applauded by both the hosts and guests. All the students of the flying school also performed various mechanical exercises for the Chinese guests, and finally lined up and shouted: "Long live the People's Republic of China, long live, long live!"

	The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation presented silk banners embroidered with the military emblem of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the naval emblem of the People's Navy, and the air force emblem of the People's Air Force to the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the United Arab Republic, respectively, and presented models of submarines and aircraft to the Navy and Air Force Headquarters of the United Arab Republic. The delegation also presented Chinese famous paintings, porcelains, and tea to the visited troops, factories, and schools. Our "August 1st" commemorative medal was also widely welcomed. Although these gifts were meager, people treasured and loved them because they came from China, thousands of miles away, and because they meant the friendship of the Chinese people and army to the people and army of the United Arab Republic. The Army, Navy, and Air Force of the United Arab Republic also sent their military flags and military emblems back to our delegation. A military factory also presented the delegation with submachine guns and automatic rifles made by themselves. General Xiao of the delegation tried them out on the factory's firing range. These two types of guns fired more than a dozen bullets, concentrated in a small square. The guests praised the good quality of the guns, while the hosts praised the guests' superb shooting skills, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. Civilian factories mostly gave their own products as gifts, while schools gave the delegation the school badges. These gifts were also highly valued by our delegation because they represented the affection of the people and army of the United Arab Republic for the Chinese people and army. When the delegation was in Alexandria, they saw a naval colonel who had visited our country hanging a gift he brought back from China—an embroidery painting—in the reception room as a constant memorial to the friendship between the Chinese people and army.

	When the delegation visited Damascus, the First Army of the United Arab Republic, the Syrian region's Cultural and National Guidance Department, and the schools of Damascus held an evening party at the Azem Palace, which began with the consecutive performance of several Chinese songs. This made the comrades of the delegation feel very cordial. Then, national music, songs, and dances of the Syrian region were performed. The hosts and guests were immersed together in a joyful atmosphere filled with applause and cheers. In Cairo, students from the Women's Sports Academy performed Egyptian national dances for the Chinese guests, as well as Chinese red silk dances, which were performed under the guidance of the president of the academy who had visited China. Chinese music was also often played at many banquets that entertained our delegation. I remember once at the Officers' Club in Damascus, the band played the song "Long Live Chairman Mao," which received warm applause from everyone.

	During the more than twenty days of our delegation's visit to the United Arab Republic, whether from Cairo to Damascus, or from Alexandria to Suez, we were warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in the United Arab Republic. They often surrounded the Chinese guests and cheered: "Ahlan wa Sahlan!" "Marhaba!" and "Salam Alaykum," etc. Although these words are not exactly the same, they mean the same thing, which is "Welcome! Welcome!" In the workshops of factories, and in the Cairo Higher Women's Sports Academy, people wrote various slogans in Arabic to warmly welcome the Chinese guests. In the lines welcoming the delegation on the roadside, some veiled women from the United Arab Republic also clapped along with everyone. We also often heard women shaking their tongues and making sharp "lu, lu, lu..." sounds. An Arab friend explained that this is a traditional Arab custom to welcome guests. This sound comes from the dantian, expressing sincere welcome to the guests. Particularly unforgettable was the Chinese guests' visit to the soldiers' residential area of the First Army in Damascus. The soldiers' families and children, dressed in festive costumes, crowded on both sides of the street, waiting early. As soon as the Chinese guests arrived, a group of girls rushed up to offer flowers, and the soldiers' families standing on the side of the road, according to Arab custom, sprinkled perfume on the guests. People clapped and sang to welcome the Chinese guests, and the atmosphere was very warm and lively. On this day, the Chinese guests and the hosts cordially talked about family matters. General Zhang Zongxun also took a group photo with a soldier's family. When it was time to say goodbye, the hosts were reluctant to leave and walked a distance with the car. A girl also picked a handful of flowers and rushed to send them into the car. The host explained to the delegation: "The reason why we welcome you so warmly is because you come from our friendly country—great People's China!"

	Although China and the United Arab Republic are separated by thousands of miles geographically, the friendly exchanges between the people of the two countries have a long history.

	During the delegation's visit, we saw ancient Chinese porcelain in many places, and we also saw a group of "Beijing ducks" in the agricultural inspection station in Sheh province. The station chief said that it was a duck breed that was previously introduced from Beijing, so it was named "Beijing duck." After China and the United Arab Republic achieved their respective independence, especially since the Bandung Conference, the traditional friendship between the people of the two countries has developed in a new way on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit. The exchanges between the two countries in political, economic, and cultural aspects have become increasingly frequent, and a close friendship has also been established between the two armies. We have every reason to hope and believe that this visit of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation will help the further development of the friendship between the people and armies of China and the United Arab Republic.

    尼罗河畔话友谊
    ——记中国军事友好代表团在阿联的友好访问
    刘开宸
    尼罗河畔，碧空万里，白云片片。青蓝色的枣树上，沉甸甸地挂着紫红的和橙黄的果实。阿拉伯联合共和国的土地，风光秀丽。以中国人民解放军副总参谋长张宗逊上将为首的中国军事友好代表团，应阿拉伯联合共和国副总统兼国防部长阿密尔元帅的邀请，从9月26日到10月23日在这个美丽的国度进行了友好访问。
    中国军事友好代表团访问了阿联的陆、海、空军，军事工厂和民用工厂，也参观了阿联的学校和名胜古迹，把中国人民和军队的友谊，带给阿联的人民和军队。中国客人受到了阿联人民和军队的热情接待和热烈欢迎。10月11日，阿联总统纳赛尔接见了代表团，同团员们进行了友好的交谈。纳赛尔总统表示，中国军事友好代表团的访问将会进一步增进阿中两国人民的友谊。
    代表团在访问中，和阿联武装部队的将领们进行了亲切的交谈。他们对中国人民在1956年阿联抵抗帝国主义武装侵略时所给予的支持，纷纷表示感谢。阿联武装部队参谋长阿里·阿密尔谈道：“在1956年苏伊士运河事件的危机中，中国人民给予了阿联以道义和物质的援助，在阿联人民的心目中留下了深刻的印象。”张宗逊上将在开罗的一次宴会上说：“中阿两国都受过帝国主义、殖民主义长期的统治和压迫。两国人民都是经历了千辛万苦，进行了长期的英勇斗争，才把自己的祖国从水深火热中解放出来。中国人民一贯支持阿联人民反对帝国主义的正义斗争。中国人民和军队，十分钦佩阿联人民和军队1956年在抗击帝国主义武装侵略的斗争中所表现的英雄气概。在你们进行光荣战斗的日子里，我们曾为你们的胜利而感到欢欣鼓舞。在反对帝国主义侵略、维护民族独立的斗争中，中国人民将永远是阿拉伯人民、非洲人民和世界一切争取民族独立的人民最忠实可靠的朋友”。
    阿联的陆、海、空军专为中国客人举行了表演。身体健壮的士兵们，抓住沙漠中的蛇和刺猬，剥下皮用火烤了就吃，一共只花了两分钟，这样艰苦的训练，是为了应付在沙漠战斗中可能遇到的绝粮处境。刚入伍两周的海军战士，表演了一些轻武器的基本操练。高射炮学校的学员在海边举行了实弹演习，终于打下了一架用无线电操纵的小飞机。飞行学校的学员，作了精采的特技表演。他们还用二十五架飞机排成“CAF”（中国空军）三个英文字母，向中国客人所坐的看台上空飞来；后来又用十五架飞机组成金字塔形在天空翱翔，表示中阿两国人民和空军的友谊。这些表演受到了宾主双方的热烈鼓掌。飞行学校的全体学员还为中国客人表演各种机械体操，最后列队高呼：“中华人民共和国万岁，万岁，万岁！”
    中国军事友好代表团曾把绣有中国人民解放军军徽、人民海军军徽和人民空军军徽的锦旗，分别送给阿联的陆、海、空军，把潜水艇和飞机的模型送给阿联的海、空军司令部。代表团还把中国的名画、瓷器、茶叶等送给访问的军队、工厂和学校。我们的“八一”纪念章也受到了很广泛的欢迎。尽管这些礼物是微薄的，人们却珍贵和喜爱它，因为它来自万里之外的中国，因为它意味着中国人民和军队对阿联人民和军队的友谊。阿联陆、海、空军也把他们的军旗、军徽回送给我代表团。一个军事工厂还把他们自制的冲锋枪和自动步枪送给代表团。代表团的萧将军在工厂的试靶场上试用。这两种枪发射十几发子弹，集中地打在一个小方格里。客人赞扬枪枝的质量好，主人却夸奖客人高超的射击技术，气氛十分融洽。民用工厂多以自己的产品相赠，学校则把学校的校徽送给代表团。这些礼物，同样受到我们代表团的很大重视，因为它代表着阿联人民和军队对中国人民和军队的情意。代表团在亚力山大的时候，就曾看到一位访问过我国的海军上校，把他从中国带回的一件礼物——一幅织锦画，挂在会客室里，做为对中国人民和军队友谊的经常纪念。
    代表团访问大马士革的时候，阿联的第一军、叙利亚地区的文化和国家指导部以及大马士革的学校在阿泽姆古宫举行晚会，一开头就接连演奏了几支中国歌曲。这使代表团的同志们感到非常亲切。接着又演出了叙利亚地区的民族音乐、歌曲和舞蹈。主人和客人一同浸沉在充满掌声和欢呼的欢乐的气氛中。在开罗，女子体育学院的学生为中国客人表演了埃及地区的民族舞蹈，还有中国的红绸舞，这是在曾访问过中国的这个学院院长的指导下演出的。在许多招待我们代表团的宴会上，也经常演奏中国音乐。记得有一次在大马士革的军官俱乐部里，乐队演奏“万岁，毛泽东”的歌曲，获得大家热烈的鼓掌。
    我代表团在阿联访问的二十多天当中，无论从开罗到大马士革，或是从亚力山大到苏伊士，处处受到阿联各阶层人民的热烈欢迎。他们经常围住中国客人欢呼：“艾赫兰、瓦塞赫兰！”“买尔哈办！”以及“塞兰姆、阿来以可姆”等等。这些话的说法虽不尽相同，但意思是一样的，那就是“欢迎！欢迎！”在工厂的车间、在开罗高等女子体育学院里，人们用阿文写着各种各样的标语热烈欢迎中国客人。在路旁欢迎代表团的行列里，一些蒙着面纱的阿联妇女，也和大家一起鼓掌。我们还经常听到妇女抖动舌头，发出“噜、噜、噜……”的尖锐的叫声。一位阿联朋友介绍说，这是阿拉伯人欢迎客人的传统习惯。这种声音发自丹田，表示对客人们的衷心欢迎。特别令人难忘的是，中国客人对大马士革第一军士兵住宅区的访问。士兵的眷属和孩子，穿着节日的盛装，拥挤在街道两旁，早早地就在等待着了。中国客人一到，一群少女就拥上前来献花，站在道旁的士兵眷属，则按照阿拉伯人的习惯，纷纷往客人的身上洒香水。人们一边拍手，一边唱着欢迎中国客人，空气显得非常热烈和活跃。这一天，中国客人和主人们款款地叙了家常。张宗逊上将还和一位士兵的全家合影留念。当告别的时候，主人们依依不舍，拥着汽车走了一程。有个女孩子还摘了一把花，赶着送到车子里。主人向代表团解释说：“我们所以这样热烈地欢迎你们，是因为你们来自我们的友好国家——伟大的人民中国！”
    中国和阿联，虽在地理上相隔万里，但是，两国人民间的友好往来，却有着悠久的历史。
    代表团这次访问期间就曾在许多地方看到我国古代的瓷器，在舍赫省的农业检查站里，还见到一群“北京鸭”。站长说，那是以前由北京传来的鸭种，所以被取名为“北京鸭”。中国和阿联取得各自的独立以后，特别是从万隆会议以来，两国人民的传统友谊，在五项原则和万隆会议精神的基础上，有了新的发展。两国在政治、经济和文化方面的来往日益频繁，两国军队之间也建立了亲密的友谊。我们完全有理由希望并且相信，中国军事友好代表团的这次访问，将有助于中、阿两国人民和军队的友情进一步发展。
