    Hou Tingren Exerts Himself to Build Mountain Areas Thriftily and Sets an Example
    Zhuxi County Sends Ten Thousand People Uphill to Settle and Vigorously Develop Agriculture
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Wuhan on the 22nd) The experience of the Zhuxi County Comprehensive Farm in Hubei Province, led by national model agricultural laborer Hou Tingren, in building mountain areas has already blossomed and borne fruit throughout the county. Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the masses, Hou Tingren finally established a large-scale comprehensive farm in the deep mountains and forests, setting an example for developing and building mountain areas. After the Zhuxi County Party Committee put forward the call to "Learn from Hou Tingren, catch up with Hou Tingren," the broad masses of the county immediately took action, carrying their luggage and tools, and vying to settle down in the deep mountains and dense forests. As of now, more than 10,000 people in the county have entered the mountains and established 66 farms of various sizes.
    In Zhuxi County, "learning from Hou Tingren, catching up with Hou Tingren" has formed a mass movement, forming a force to encourage people to exert themselves. "Asking the mountains for grain" and "asking the mountains for money" are resounding slogans put forward by the people of Zhuxi to realize a continuous leap forward in agricultural production and rapidly change the face of the mountain areas.
    Zhuxi County is located in the large mountain area of northwestern Hubei, bordering Shaanxi and Sichuan. The terrain is high and the climate is cold, and the frost-free period is 30 to 40 days shorter than in the plains. There are two completely different understandings of such mountains: some people believe that mountain areas are "poor mountains and bad waters" with no future; others believe that mountain areas are "money trees," "treasure mountains," and "gold and silver mountains." Hou Tingren, a Communist Party member from a poor peasant background, is a prominent representative of the latter. Under the leadership of the Party organization, he relied closely on the masses, worked hard with all the farm workers, and after several years of exploration, created a set of experiences for comprehensively developing mountain areas: on the premise of having enough grain to eat and more to spare, he adopted methods of using the small to support the large, using the near to support the far, using local materials, and "incubating eggs in the nest," making full use of the natural conditions of good water sources and fertile soil in the mountain areas, as well as the climatic characteristics of "a difference of one zhang in altitude makes a difference, and the sunny and shady slopes are very different," to rapidly develop mountain production, achieving full utilization of materials and land, and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. This approach has been very effective. In seven or eight years, the farm has developed from low mountains to medium and high mountains, from the original one person, 54 mu of land, and two dilapidated thatched houses, to more than 900 workers, more than 16,000 mu of cultivated land, more than 4,200 mu of medicinal herbs, more than 160 head of cattle, more than 170 sheep, more than 900 pigs, as well as 53 various large and small factories producing paper, wine, sugar, weaving sacks, and making ham. In addition, it also produces various local specialties such as white fungus, fragrant mushrooms, and raw lacquer, accumulating a total of 2 million yuan of wealth for the country, becoming a red banner for Zhuxi County in developing and building mountain areas.
    In learning and promoting Hou Tingren's experience, people combined learning his ambition to transform nature with his successful methods of transforming nature, that is, according to the characteristics of mountain areas, different situations, and local conditions, they planted grain, cultivated medicinal herbs, developed animal husbandry, used mountain raw materials to run industry, and developed various local specialty products. The Liaoyeh Lake Production Team used to be a notoriously poor place in the county, relying on the state for grain every year. People said: "There are many mountains and few people, thick stones and thin soil, inconvenient transportation, and wild animals everywhere. What future is there in such mountains?!" However, after learning about Hou Tingren's deeds, everyone's views changed, and they all said: "If Director Hou can do it, so can we!" Therefore, according to the different situations of high and low mountains, and sunny and shady slopes, they engaged in grain production on the one hand and diversified operations on the other. Now, this team has achieved both grain and money, with surplus grain and savings for every household.

    侯廷仁发愤图强勤俭建设山区树立榜样
    竹溪县万人上山落户大办农业
    本报武汉22日电　全国农业劳动模范侯廷仁领导的湖北竹溪县综合农场建设山区的经验，已经在全县普遍开花结果。侯廷仁在党的领导和群众支持下，终于在深山老林里办起了大规模的综合农场，为开发山区、建设山区树立了榜样。当中共竹溪县委提出“学侯廷仁、赶侯廷仁”的号召后，全县广大人民立即行动起来，纷纷背着行李、带着工具，争先到深山密林里安家落户。截至目前，全县已有一万多人进山，办起大小农场六十六个。
    在竹溪县，“学侯廷仁、赶侯廷仁”已经形成群众运动，形成鼓励人们发愤图强的力量。“向山要粮”、“向山要钱”，这是竹溪人民为实现农业生产持续跃进、迅速改变山区面貌提出的响亮口号。
    竹溪县地处鄂西北大山区，与陕西、四川紧相接壤。境内山高气寒，无霜期比平原地区短三、四十天。对于这样的大山，有两种截然不同的认识：一种人认为，山区是“穷山恶水”没奔头；另一种人认为，山区是“摇钱树”、“万宝山”、“金银山”。贫农出身的共产党员侯廷仁就是后一种人突出的代表。他在党组织的领导下，紧紧依靠群众，与全场职工一起艰苦奋斗，勤俭建设，经过几年的摸索，创造了一套全面开发山区的经验：在粮食够吃有余的前提下，采取以小养大、以近养远、就地取材、就窝繁蛋的方法，充分利用山区水源好、土质肥的自然条件和“高一丈，不一样，阴阳坡，差得多”的气候特点，迅速发展山区生产，做到物尽其用，地尽其利，使农、林、牧、副全面大发展。他们这种作法收效很大，在七、八年中，这个农场便从低山发展到二高山、大高山，从原来只有一个人、五十四亩地、两间破草房，发展到九百多个工人、一万六千多亩耕地、四千二百多亩药材、一百六十多头耕牛、一百七十多只羊、九百多头猪，还有造纸、制酒、制糖、织麻袋、制火腿等各种大小工厂五十三个，另外还生产白木耳、香菌、生漆等各种土特产，总共为国家积累了二百万元财富，成为竹溪县开发山区建设山区的一面红旗。
    在学习和推广侯廷仁的经验时，人们把学习他改造自然的雄心壮志和他改造自然的成功方法结合起来，即根据山区特点，分别不同情况，因地制宜地种粮食，栽培药材，发展牧业，利用山区原料办工业和发展各种土特产品。辽叶湖生产队，过去是全县出名的穷地方，年年靠国家供应粮食。人们说：“山大人稀，石厚土薄，交通不便，野兽成群，像这样的大山，有啥奔头！？”可是，经过学习侯廷仁的事迹后，大家的看法变了，都说：“侯场长能办到，我们也行！”于是，他们根据高低山、阴阳坡的不同情况，一面大搞粮食，一面大搞多种经营。现在，这个队达到了既有粮，又有钱，粮食有余，户户有存款。
