Various green fodders, such as wild grass, aquatic plants, vines of melons and sweet potatoes, green corn stalks, and vegetable scraps, contain rich nutrients and vitamins. Collecting and storing them in large quantities is an important way to solve the problem of winter forage for pigs and large livestock. Currently, in the southern regions, plants suitable for green fodder are still lush, and in the northern regions, wild grasses and vegetables have not yet withered. We should seize the opportunity to arrange labor, combining autumn harvesting and planting work to collect and store all green fodder as much as possible. Now, we will introduce two main storage methods as follows:

I. Ensiling Method

In the storage process of green fodder, ensiling is a method that minimizes the loss of nutrients. At the same time, ensiling can maintain the original green, juicy, and soft characteristics of green fodder, making it the best method for storing fodder. Ensiling involves chopping fresh green fodder into short pieces, filling and compacting it in sealed cellars. Where conditions are insufficient, above-ground ensiling and whole-plant ensiling methods can also be adopted. Due to compaction and sealing, it can remain intact for a long time. The key points of making it are as follows:

1.  Selection of Materials. Various non-toxic terrestrial and aquatic wild grasses and vegetables, green vines of melons, sweet potatoes, and beans, corn stalks that have not completely withered, and vegetable scraps are all good raw materials for ensiling. For pig raising, it is best to choose sweet potato vines, wild vegetables, and tree leaves as raw materials; for feeding large livestock, it is best to choose corn stalks and wild grass as raw materials. Various raw materials can be stored separately or mixed. Aquatic plants and vegetable scraps with high water content are best ensiled with dry roughage such as rice bran to regulate moisture.

2.  Digging a Cellar. Choose a location that is high-lying, sunny, with hard soil, and a low water table, so that water does not easily accumulate in the cellar. The cellar site should be as close as possible to the livestock sheds for easy access, but it should be away from manure pits, urine ditches, rivers, and ponds to prevent dirty water from seeping in, and it should not be dug near large trees. If it is sandy soil, apply a layer of clay around the walls and bottom of the cellar to prevent leakage. The size of the cellar should be determined by the amount of feed. For small quantities, a cylindrical cellar is suitable. After the cellar is dug, the walls and bottom should be patted firmly and smoothly, and it can be filled after it is dried.

3.  Treatment of Raw Materials. Green silage must be free of mud, impurities, and roots with soil, and moldy stems and leaves must be removed. Stalks and vines should be cut as short as possible. If there is not enough labor and tools at the time, whole-plant silage can also be used. The moisture content of silage raw materials should generally be adjusted to 20%—80%.

4.  Filling. It is best to lay a layer of dry grass on the bottom of the cellar before filling. Silage raw materials should be loaded layer by layer, and each layer should be stepped on to ensure that it is stepped on very tightly. Special attention should be paid to stepping firmly on the edges and corners of the cellar, and air should be excluded from the cellar as much as possible. Whole-plant silage requires even more forceful compaction. This is an important key to silage feed and must be noted. When wet and dry materials are mixed for storage, they should be loaded alternately in layers of wet and dry, or mixed well before filling. Step on each layer as you load it until it is level with the ground. After the cellar is filled, it is best to cover it with a layer of green grass, and then seal it with thick soil.

5.  Sealing the Cellar. In sunny weather, the cellar can be sealed two days later. If it rains, the cellar should be sealed with soil after it is filled, or covered with mats. The soil on the cellar should be sealed thickly and tightly, generally one foot thick. In northern regions, it should be thicker to prevent freezing. In southern regions with more rain, it is best to add some shelters on the cellar and dig drainage ditches around the cellar. After the cellar is sealed, the raw materials gradually sink, and the sealing soil on the cellar will sink or crack, so it is necessary to check and repair it frequently.

6.  Opening and Using. About one and a half months after storage, the raw materials in the cellar have fermented, and the cellar can be opened for use. If it is not needed at the time, there is no need to open it.

7.  Feeding. When feeding livestock with silage for the first time, the livestock may not be willing to eat it, so feed a little less at the beginning, and then gradually increase the amount, and they will gradually get used to it.

II. Dry Storage Method

Dry storage is to dry green fodder in the sun and then store it. If wild grass and vegetables are properly treated and made into green hay, they are also high-quality forage for livestock.

The main requirements for sun-curing green hay are not to be too wet and not to be too dry. If it is too wet, it will easily mold after stacking, and if it is too dry, the leaves will fall off, resulting in a large loss of nutrients. The appropriate moisture content after drying is 14%—17%. At the same time, it is necessary to maintain the green color and grass fragrance, and not to allow it to change color.

1.  Selection of Materials. Wild grass and vegetables can be dried and stored. In order to improve the quality of dry hay, it is best to choose wild grasses and vegetables that are about to bloom or have not fully bloomed as raw materials.

2.  Sun-curing. In order to maintain the green color and grass fragrance of green hay, it is advisable to use sun-curing for freshly cut green grass with a lot of moisture. Spread it on the ground and let it dry in the sun for five to six hours, turning it once or twice to quickly reach a semi-dry state. Then gather it into ridges or small piles to reduce the contact surface with sunlight, allowing it to gradually air dry. When the required moisture content is reached, it can be collected and stacked into large stacks. Areas with conditions can use bamboo poles, branches, etc. to make racks and hang the grass on the racks to dry. No matter how it is dried, rain should be prevented during the drying process. If it is infiltrated by rain or dew, open it and dry it to avoid mold.

3.  Stacking. Small amounts of dry grass and dry vegetables are best stored indoors. Large quantities should be stacked outdoors in circular or rectangular stacks. The stacking site should be high and dry, and the top of the stack should be covered with grass and mud. (Xinhua News Agency)

    怎样贮藏青饲料
    各种青绿饲料，如野草、水生植物、瓜薯藤蔓、青玉米秸和菜帮子等，都含有丰富的营养物质和维生素。大量收集和贮藏起来，是解决猪和大家畜冬季饲草问题的重要途径。目前，南方地区可作青饲料的植物还很繁茂，北方地区的野草、野菜尚未枯萎，应当抓紧时机安排劳动力，结合秋收秋种工作把一切青饲料尽量采集贮藏起来，现在介绍两种主要的贮藏方法如下：
    一、青贮法
    在青饲料的贮藏过程中，青贮是使养料损失最少的一种方法；同时，青贮能保持青饲料原有的青绿、多汁、柔软等特点，是贮藏饲料的最好方法。青贮就是把新鲜的青饲料切短，装填压实在密封的地窖里。条件不够的地方，也可以采取地上青贮和整株青贮办法，由于压紧密封，也可以长期不坏。制作的要点如下：
    1、选料。各种无毒的陆生、水生野草、野菜，青绿的瓜、薯、豆类藤蔓，没有全部枯黄的玉米秸和蔬菜帮子等，都是青贮的好原料。养猪最好选红薯藤和野菜、树叶作原料；喂大家畜最好选玉米秸和野草作原料。各种原料可以分别贮，也可以混合贮。含水量较多的水生植物和菜帮子最好与谷糠等干粗饲料混合青贮，以调节水分。
    2、挖窖。选择地势较高、向阳、土质坚硬、地下水位较低的地点挖窖，使窖内不易积水。窖址尽可能靠近畜舍以便取用；但要远离粪坑、尿沟、河流、池塘，防止脏水渗进去，也不要挖在大树附近。如果是砂质土壤，要在窖的四周和底部抹上一层粘土，以防漏水。窖的大小要看饲料多少来决定。数量少的以圆桶形窖为宜。窖挖好后，要把四壁和底部拍打结实光滑，晒干后就可装料。
    3、原料的处理。青贮饲料必须除去污泥、杂质和带土的根，霉烂的茎、叶都要拣除。秸秆、藤蔓切得愈短愈好。如果当时劳动力和工具不足，也可整株青贮。青贮原料的含水量一般应调节到20％—80％。
    4、装料。装料前最好在窖底铺上一层干草。青贮原料要一层一层装进去，装一层，踩一层，一定要保证踩的非常紧。尤其是窖边和角上更要注意踩实，尽量排除窖内的空气。整株青贮更要大力踩紧。这是青贮饲料的重要关键，必须注意。湿料与干料混贮时，应一层湿，一层干，交互装填；或者先混和好再填装。这样装一层踩一层，一直装到与地面相平。窖填满后，上面最好再铺上一层青草，然后再封厚土。
    5、封窖。天晴可以隔一天再封窖。如果下雨，装满后就要封土，或者用席帘盖好。窖上的土要封的厚，封的紧，一般要有一尺。北方地区为了防冻更要厚一些。南方多雨地区，最好再在窖上加上一些掩蔽物，并在窖的四周挖排水沟。封窖后原料逐渐下沉，窖上的封土会下陷或裂缝，因此要经常检查修补。
    6、开窖取用。贮后一个半月左右，窖里的原料已发酵好了，就可以开窖取用。如果当时不需要，就不必打开。
    7、喂用。开始给家畜喂青贮饲料时，家畜可能不太肯吃，所以刚开始时要少喂一些，以后逐渐增加，慢慢会养成习惯。
    二、干藏法
    干藏，就是把青饲料晒干、晾干，然后贮藏。野草、野菜如果处理适当，制成青干草，也是喂家畜的上等饲草。
    晒制青干草的主要要求，是不要过湿，不要过干。过湿堆垛后容易发霉，过干叶子脱落，损失大量养料。晒好后的适当含水量是14％—17％。同时，要保持青绿颜色和草香，不要使它变色。
    1、选料。野草、野菜都可晒干贮藏。为了提高干草的质量，最好选将要开花或者花还没有开足以前的野草、野菜作为原料。
    2、晒制。为了保持青干草的青绿颜色和草香，对于刚打下来的、含水量很多的青草宜用日晒，就地铺开，让它在太阳下晒五到六小时，翻一两次，迅速达到半干状态。然后聚成垅行或者小堆，减少与阳光的接触面，让它逐渐风干，等达到要求的含水量时，即可收集起来，垛成大垛。有条件的地区可用竹竿、树枝等做成架子，把草挂在架子上晒。无论怎样晒，在晒制过程中，都要防止雨淋。如果雨渗、露湿，就把它打开晒干，以免霉烂。
    3、堆垛。少量的干草、干菜最好放在室内。大量的应在室外垛成圆形或者长方形的大垛。堆垛的地方要地势高燥，堆顶应盖草抹泥。　（新华社）
