Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: The people's communes in Handan City, Hebei Province, have launched a mass movement to select and retain good cotton seeds in conjunction with the harvesting of new cotton.

Handan City is one of the major cotton-producing areas in Hebei Province. In recent years, due to the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," the cotton has basically achieved good seed standardization, significantly increasing cotton yield and quality. This year, the people's communes have also established 992,300 mu of main crop seed bases, focusing on cotton, and 328 small farms, small experimental farms, and original seed farms for breeding improved varieties. This has created favorable conditions for doing a good job in the selection, retention, and breeding of good seeds this year. However, some areas have suffered from natural disasters such as floods, droughts, diseases, and pests this year, and some cotton fields have undergone several rounds of replanting, resulting in uneven varieties and growth, requiring more detailed and precise selection work. Based on these circumstances, the Handan Municipal Party Committee issued a call to cadres and members of the city to comprehensively carry out cotton seed selection, and convened meetings to make specific arrangements. To ensure the quality of improved varieties, all localities, in their seed selection work, have fully organized and arranged a set of selection, processing, and storage methods adapted to local conditions, in accordance with the spirit of "designating plots, concentrating on seed selection, setting time and quantity, processing separately, factories and stations being responsible, ensuring quality and quantity, selling lint cotton, and returning cottonseed to the team" proposed by the province. Nangong County has designated nine cotton processing factories in the county to specifically gin seed cotton, contracting the ginning of seed tasks for 28 10,000-mu-plus high-yield cotton fields from 14 communes. Each commune also uses the seed base of the high-yield fields as a base, selecting plots with better growth and high varietal purity as seed selection plots. The production team organizes labor to select and retain mid-season cotton, concentrates on selling and processing it, and the production team transports and stores it separately according to next year's cotton planting plan, strengthening management. In order to prevent the mixing of seed cotton and commodity cotton, the seven communes of Mingguang and Zhoucun in Yongnian County have also adopted the method of setting up warehouses in the factory based on high-yield fields. After processing the seeds, they are still stacked and stored in the warehouses by high-yield fields, and flags, signs, and special personnel are assigned for guarding.

In the process of seed selection, in order to make the selected and retained improved varieties achieve excellence, all localities have also comprehensively promoted cotton "field mixed seed selection," adopting the methods of separate picking, separate drying, separate loading, and separate sales, and widely implemented quota rewards and fixed responsibility systems. In order to select good seeds, Boyan Commune in Wu'an Mining Area trained 1,058 seed selection experts, implementing the six-fixation method of fixing personnel, fixing plots, fixing tasks, fixing time, fixing work points, and fixing rewards, greatly accelerating the progress of seed selection and improving the quality of cotton seed selection.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: The people's communes in Linqing City, Shandong Province, have extensively carried out mass cotton field seed selection activities in conjunction with the harvesting of new cotton. According to recent statistics, more than 2.8 million jin of various high-quality cotton seeds have been selected and picked throughout the city. After testing, it has been proven that the purity and quality of these seeds are better than in previous years.

Linqing City is one of the key cotton-producing areas in Shandong Province. This year, the city has a large area of high-yield cotton fields with many varieties, and the picking task is heavier than in previous years; especially after the implementation of centralized cotton picking, purchasing, and processing, the seed preservation work of careful selection, fine retention, separate processing, and separate storage is even more important. According to these characteristics, the people's communes in the suburbs of the city drew cadres and members to conduct training on seed selection work before the start of the seed selection work, and formed a number of seed selection work teams, adopting the method of "four fixations" and "four combinations" to select and retain cotton seeds. The "four fixations" and "four combinations" are: fixed seed selection personnel, fixed seed selection land, fixed delivery personnel, fixed custodians; combining picking cotton and seed selection, combining delivery of seed cotton and commodity cotton, combining picking seed cotton and processing, and combining factory machine processing and native roller processing.

In the work of selecting and retaining cotton seeds, many communes and teams have also adopted the method of combining cadres, technicians, and old farmers to inspect and appraise seed fields, original seed farms, variety experiment fields, etc., plot by plot, determining to implement separate picking and storage for more than 80,000 mu of general seed fields; to carry out plant selection, boll selection, and plot selection for more than 10,000 mu of original seed farms to maintain the purity of the original seeds; and to implement full selection and full retention for new varieties that have been bred and successfully introduced for trial planting. Many communes also grasped the methods of universal selection and key selection in the seed selection work, putting various types of improved varieties tested separately, preparing to continue to carry out cultivation experiments next year.

### 今年选好种明年长好棉  邯郸、临清等重点棉区在摘花时候大选良种

    今年选好种  明年长好棉
    邯郸、临清等重点棉区在摘花时候大选良种
    据新华社天津电　河北省邯郸市各人民公社结合采摘新花，掀起了一个群众性的选留棉花良种运动。
    邯郸市是河北省的主要棉产区之一。几年来，由于全面地贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，基本上实现了棉花良种化，显著的提高了棉花的产量和质量。今年，各人民公社又以棉花为主，建立了主要农作物种子基地九十九点二三万亩，繁育良种的小农场、小试验场和原种场三百二十八个。给今年搞好良种选留繁育创造了有利条件。但是，部分地区，因为今年遭受水、旱、病、虫等自然灾害，有些棉田经过几次查补，品种不一，生长不齐，需要进行更细致、更精密的精选工作。邯郸市委根据这些情况，向全市广大干部、社员发出了全面开展棉花选种的号召，并召开会议具体部署。为了保证良种质量，各地在选种工作中，都根据省提出的“划定地片，集中选种，定时定量，分别加工，厂站负责，保质保量，皮棉交售，棉籽归队”的精神，全面地组织和安排了一套适应各地具体情况的选留、加工、保管办法。南宫县全县确定九个棉花加工厂专轧种籽棉，分片包了十四个公社的二十八个万亩以上的棉花丰产方轧籽种任务。每个公社还以丰产方的种籽基地为基地，选择生长较好、品种纯度高的地段，作为选种片，由生产队组织劳力，选留中喷棉，集中交售、加工，生产队按明年种棉计划，分别取运、储存，加强保管。永年县的洺关、周村等七个公社为了防止种棉与商品棉混杂，还采用了厂内以丰产方设仓的办法，加工出种籽后，仍以丰产方成垛、仓，并分别插旗、挂牌、专人看管。
    在选种过程中，为了使选留的良种达到精益求精，各地还全面推行了棉花“田间混合选种”，采取分摘、分晒、分装车、分交售方法，并广泛实行了定额奖励和固定责任制。武安矿区的伯延公社，为了把种选好，培训了一千零五十八名选种能手，实行定人员、定地块、定任务、定时间、定工分、定奖励的六定办法，大大加快了选种进度，提高了棉花选种质量。
    据新华社济南电　山东省临清市各人民公社结合收摘新棉，广泛的开展了群众性的棉花田间选种活动。据最近统计，全市已选摘各种优良棉籽二百八十多万斤。经过化验，证明这些种籽的纯度和质量比往年好。
    临清市是山东省重点产棉区之一。今年，全市棉花丰产方的面积大，品种多，采摘任务比往年重；特别是实行棉花采摘、收购、加工集中以后，使精选、细留、分别加工、分别存放的保种工作显得更为重要。根据这些特点，全市郊区各人民公社在选种工作开始以前就抽调了干部和社员，进行了选种工作的训练，组成了若干选种工作队，采用“四固定”“四结合”的方法选留棉种。“四固定”、“四结合”是：固定选种人员，固定选种地，固定交送人员，固定保管员；摘拾棉花和选种结合，交送种子棉和商品棉结合，摘拾种子棉和加工结合，工厂机器加工和土轧车加工结合。
    在选留棉种的工作中，许多社、队还采取干部、技术员、老农三结合的方法，对种子田、原种场、品种试验场等逐块检查鉴定，确定对八万多亩一般种子田，实行分摘分放；对一万多亩原种场进行株选、桃选、片选，保持原种纯度；对自育和引进试种成功的新品种，实行全选全留。许多公社在选种工作中还掌握了普遍选和重点选的方法，把试验的各类良种单放起来，准备到明年继续进行栽培试验。
