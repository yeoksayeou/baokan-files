Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 28th: As the 43rd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution approaches, good news about production competitions frequently arrives from all parts of the Soviet Union. The Soviet working people are dedicating outstanding achievements in communist construction to the great festival.

The Moscow Oblast and Leningrad Oblast economic regions, the Kaliningrad, Novosibirsk, Sverdlovsk, and Kuibyshev economic regions, and the Belorussian and Lithuanian Republics have all completed their gross industrial output plans and production plans for most important industrial products for the first ten months of this year eight to eleven days ahead of schedule. Compared with the same period last year, the gross industrial output of the Moscow Oblast economic region increased by 8% in the first ten months of this year, and the plan to increase labor productivity was completed ahead of schedule. The gross industrial output of the Leningrad Oblast economic region increased by 9% in the first ten months compared with the same period last year, and the Kaliningrad economic region increased by 29%. While completing the production plan ahead of schedule, various regions have also made remarkable achievements in accelerating technological progress. For example, since the beginning of this year, enterprises in the Moscow Oblast economic region have established seven fully mechanized and automated workshops and work sections, installed more than 160 automated, semi-automated, and mechanized assembly lines, and more than 150 kinds of high-efficiency production equipment, and mastered the mass production of 720 kinds of new machines and instruments.

In the competition to welcome the festival, many labor collectives have created outstanding achievements in increasing production, practicing thrift, and tapping potential. The Communist Youth League-Youth Blast Furnace Production Team of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Combine recently created a national iron smelting speed record of producing iron nine times a day, while also reducing coke consumption. This production team has overfulfilled its production plan by more than 500 tons of pig iron in October. At the Lenin Steel Plant in Dnepropetrovsk, the production team led by Communist Party member Blagov recently reduced the time for smelting each furnace of steel from the planned seven hours to three hours and forty minutes, and increased the steel output per square meter of furnace bottom area from 5.6 tons to 12 tons. The "Northern" mine in Kuzbass has increased its daily coal output from 200 to 250 tons in the past to 650 tons. As a result of vigorously implementing technological innovation measures and launching a rationalization proposal campaign, the Moscow Dynamo Electric Motor Factory, in addition to completing the production plan for the first ten months ahead of schedule, also saved the country 5 million rubles in funds.

Driven by the upsurge of the labor competition to welcome the festival, the construction workers on the construction sites of the Seven-Year Plan have also greatly accelerated the construction speed. At the world-renowned Bratsk Hydropower Station construction site, the concrete dam on the right bank has reached a height that can guarantee the operation of the first batch of generator units next year. The builders are now fighting hard in the severe cold of Siberia to ensure that the generator units can be successfully put into production next year. The eleventh 57,200-kilowatt generator unit of the Ukrainian Kremenchug Hydropower Station was recently put into production almost two years ahead of schedule. The builders are striving to have the last generator unit generate electricity before the October Revolution Day. A fully automated blast furnace newly built at the Yenakiyevo Metallurgical Plant in Stalino Oblast also produced iron recently seventy days ahead of schedule.

In recent days, good news has also been frequently reported on the agricultural front. Agricultural laborers in Stavropol Krai, Rostov, Kurgan, Irkutsk, Orenburg, and Stalingrad Oblasts have all successfully completed their socialist pledges to sell grain to the state before the October Revolution Day. In this regard, Orenburg Oblast has achieved the most outstanding results, selling 160 million poods (each pood equals 32.76 catties) of grain to the state, which is 48 million poods more than the original plan. From many regions such as the Moscow Oblast economic region and the Kyrgyz Republic, there has also been good news of completing the plan to sell livestock products ahead of schedule.

Currently, socialist labor competitions are widely launched between national economic zones, between factories, and between workshops in the Soviet Union. The picture shows the members of the Minayev Communist Labor Team of the Moscow "Red Proletarian" factory in front of their newly installed automated assembly line for producing gears. Due to this improvement, work efficiency has more than doubled, while manpower has been reduced by half.

    各经济部门捷报频传迎接伟大节日
    苏联各地生产竞赛取得显著成绩
    新华社莫斯科28日电　在伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年即将来临的日子里，苏联全国各地频频传来生产竞赛的捷报。苏联劳动人民正以共产主义建设中的优异成绩，向伟大的节日献礼。
    莫斯科州和列宁格勒州经济区，加里宁格勒、新西伯利亚、斯维德洛夫斯克和古比雪夫等经济区，以及白俄罗斯、立陶宛等共和国，都提前八天到十一天完成了今年头十个月的工业总产值计划和大部分重要工业产品的生产计划。和去年同期比较，莫斯科州经济区今年头十个月的工业总产值增长了8％，并且提前完成了提高劳动生产率的计划。列宁格勒州经济区头十个月的工业总产值比去年同期增长了9％，加里宁格勒经济区增长了29％。与提前完成生产计划同时，各地区在加快技术进步方面也取得了显著的成绩。例如，莫斯科州经济区的企业从今年年初以来已经建立了七个全盘机械化和自动化的车间和工段，安装了一百六十多条自动化、半自动化和机械化作业线，以及一百五十多种高效能的生产设备，掌握了七百二十种新式机器和仪器的成批生产。
    在迎接节日的竞赛中，许多劳动集体在增加生产、厉行节约和挖掘潜力方面创造了出色的成绩。马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂的共青团——青年高炉生产队，最近创造了每昼夜出九次铁的全国炼铁速度纪录，同时还降低了焦炭的消耗。这个生产队在10月份已经超计划生产了五百多吨生铁。在第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克的列宁钢铁厂，由共产党员布拉戈夫领导的生产队，最近把炼每炉钢的时间由计划规定的七小时减少到三小时四十分，把每平方米炉底面积的出钢量由五点六吨提高到十二吨。库兹巴斯的“北方”矿井已经把每昼夜的采煤量由过去的二百至二百五十吨提高到六百五十吨。莫斯科狄纳莫电机制造厂由于大力贯彻技术革新措施和开展合理化建议运动的结果，除了提前完成了头十个月的生产计划外，还为国家节约了五百万卢布的资金。
    在迎接节日的劳动竞赛热潮的推动下，七年计划建设工地上的建筑工人们也大大加快了施工速度。在世界闻名的布拉次克水电站工地上，右岸的混凝土堤坝已经达到了可以保证明年第一批发电机组工作的高度。建设者们现在正冒着西伯利亚的严寒努力奋战，以保证来年发电机组能顺利投入生产。乌克兰克列门楚格水电站的第十一台五万七千二百瓩的发电机组，几乎提前两年在最近投入了生产。建设者们正在争取使最后一台发电机组在十月革命节前发电。斯大林诺州的叶纳基耶沃冶金厂新建的一座完全自动化的高炉，也提前七十天在最近出铁。
    连日来，农业战线上也纷纷传来了捷报。斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区、罗斯托夫、库尔干斯克、伊尔库次克、奥伦堡和斯大林格勒等州的农业劳动者，都在十月革命节前胜利地完成了向国家交售谷物的社会主义保证。在这方面，奥伦堡州的成绩最为突出，它向国家交售了一亿六千万普特（每普特合三二·七六市斤）的谷物，即超过原订计划四千八百万普特。从莫斯科州经济区和吉尔吉斯共和国等许多地区，还传来了提前完成交售畜产品计划的喜讯。（附图片）
    目前苏联国民经济区之间，厂与厂之间，车间与车间之间都广泛地展开了社会主义劳动竞赛。图为莫斯科“红色无产者”工厂米纳耶夫共产主义劳动队的队员在他们新装设的生产齿轮的自动化作业线前。由于这一改进，工作效率提高了一倍多，而人力却节省了一半。
