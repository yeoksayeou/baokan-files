Xinhua News Agency, 30th, New York: The United Nations General Assembly continued its session on the 29th, proceeding with the general political debate.

The first speaker was Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia. Sihanouk urged the Assembly to take note of the situation in which the People's Republic of China was denied its right of representation in the United Nations. He stated that major international problems could not be resolved without the participation of the legitimate representatives of the Chinese people, who number nearly seven hundred million and whose national power is constantly growing.

The head of the Cambodian delegation expressed concern about the situation in Laos. He pointed out that in Laos, foreign encouragement, and even support, for plans of insurrection against the legitimate government in Vientiane are becoming more and more openly exposed. He advocated Lao neutrality and that its unity and territorial integrity be internationally guaranteed.

Sihanouk advocated the establishment of a neutral zone in Southeast Asia composed of Laos and Cambodia, in order to help maintain peace.

British Prime Minister Macmillan then spoke. In his speech, he echoed the speech made by US President Eisenhower on the 22nd, and did his best to support Eisenhower's advocacy of using the United Nations to carry out imperialist aggressive plots. He believed that the power to use the United Nations to "deal with possible crises" should be "increased rather than reduced." He opposed the Soviet Union's proposal to reorganize the United Nations organization and administrative institutions, and praised the United Nations for its role in assisting the United States in realizing its conspiracy to swallow up the Congo. He said that the British government believes that the United Nations action in the Congo is "timely and should continue."

Macmillan also openly defended the revival of West German militarism. Macmillan insisted that "there is no question of Germany (West Germany) taking independent military action that could threaten peace." He also attacked the condemnation by representatives of Eastern European socialist countries of the West's policy of rearming West Germany as lacking a "spirit of reconciliation." Macmillan's action in acting as a defender of West German militarism was warmly welcomed by West German militarists. Karl-Heinrich Knappstein, the West German observer to the UN, immediately visited Macmillan after his speech and expressed his government's great satisfaction with Macmillan's services.

Macmillan also put forward so-called "three steps" to solve the disarmament issue, but his so-called "three steps" are just a variant of the West's scheme of supervised disarmament without disarmament. He enthusiastically promoted Eisenhower's so-called "supervision" plan, which was put forward for the purpose of espionage, and advocated the establishment of a so-called expert group to "put forward guiding principles for establishing fair and effective supervision." He nonsensically said that espionage against other countries is "human nature." He also created a peculiar formula, called letting "disarmament" keep up with "the pace of supervision."

Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala, speaking at the meeting, pointed out that the United Nations cannot become a truly universal organization until the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations is restored. He also pointed out that the Mongolian People's Republic should also have the legitimate right to occupy its seat in the United Nations.

Koirala also expressed support for the Algerian people in achieving independence. Koirala believes that the territorial integrity and political independence of the Congo must be guaranteed.

Representatives of Libya, Pakistan, Austria, and Ecuador also spoke at yesterday's meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: The United Nations General Assembly continued its general debate on September 30.

Władysław Gomułka, head of the delegation of the Polish People's Republic, spoke first at the morning session, condemning British Prime Minister Macmillan's fallacy of openly defending the revival of West German militarism in his speech on the 29th. Gomułka said that Macmillan had failed to deny any of the facts he had pointed out regarding the militarization of West Germany.

Gomułka said that the Polish government and Poland's allies have more than once emphasized the unchangeable nature of the Polish borders. Macmillan should understand how serious is the demand to change these borders by military means. Gomułka compared the British Prime Minister's current policy with Chamberlain's policy during the Second World War, and sternly condemned Macmillan for regarding Poland as convertible loose change and attempting to exchange it for West Germany's support for Britain's interests in the Common Market.

Then the representatives of Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia spoke, condemning colonialism and imperialism.

Czechoslovak Foreign Minister David, speaking at the afternoon session, severely condemned British Prime Minister Macmillan for defending West German militarism and revanchism in his speech. David pointed out that Macmillan's attitude towards West German imperialism reminded us of one of his predecessors - Chamberlain. The name of this gentleman will always be associated with the shameful Munich Agreement.

Indonesian President Sukarno then spoke, expressing regret that not all Asian and African countries are represented in the United Nations, especially an ancient, wise, and powerful country. Sukarno said, I am talking about China, this China is often referred to as Communist China, which is the only China for us.

When talking about disarmament, Sukarno called for a ban on nuclear weapons tests and the realization of genuine disarmament. He emphasized that as long as imperialism exists, even if a complete disarmament agreement is achieved, it cannot guarantee lasting peace. He said that West Irian is a colonialist sword aimed at Indonesia. The direct cause of the threat to peace is the existence of colonialism and imperialism.

Sukarno expressed support for the Algerian people's struggle for independence.

Sukarno also talked in detail about the "Pancasila" five principles as the basis of Indonesian policy.

Sukarno said that the United Nations Charter does not reflect today's reality. Accepting the five principles will consolidate the United Nations Charter. Sukarno also said that the United Nations should move out of the country with a Cold War atmosphere. He also called for revising the United Nations Charter and reconsidering the allocation of seats in the Security Council and other United Nations bodies to reflect the true situation in the modern world.

Sukarno then talked about the United Nations' failure to find a solution to the West Irian issue. He pointed out that the United Nations is a product of the Western country system. Imperialism and colonialism are the results of this Western country system.

Sukarno finally put forward a proposal in the name of the delegations of Ghana, India, the United Arab Republic, Yugoslavia, and Indonesia, suggesting that in order to ease international tensions and solve important international issues, the General Assembly should ask the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the US President to resume contact as the first step. Sukarno asked the General Assembly to pass this proposal as soon as possible, and hoped that the joint proposal would be unanimously adopted at the General Assembly.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th: The United Nations General Assembly continued its general debate on the 3rd.

Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev first spoke at the morning session on the issue of changing the structure of the United Nations executive body.

Khrushchev explained the position of the Soviet delegation on the role and status of the UN executive bodies, noting that the structure of certain UN bodies is now outdated. He said it is important that the UN be able to put out the sparks of war in a timely manner. To do this, it is necessary to take into account the interests of all three groups of countries, as well as the interests of colonial peoples. He said we want the UN to truly become an institution in which the interests of all groups of countries that join the UN are equally considered and protected.

Khrushchev also called for practical measures to achieve complete and thorough disarmament. Khrushchev also said that the colonial system is now outdated. Our responsibility is to bury this rotten corpse as soon as possible, thereby clearing the atmosphere and creating conditions in the world for a better life for all mankind.

Khrushchev stressed the support of the Soviet people for the people who are fighting for liberation. He said, if anyone thinks this is a call to rebellion, then I will be proud and declare that the freedom-loving people of the Soviet Union are extending a helping hand to those who rise up against the colonialists and fight for their freedom and independence.

Khrushchev finally expressed his belief that the cause of peace will eventually triumph throughout the world.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru spoke. Nehru said that disarmament is the primary issue in the world today and that no delay can be tolerated. But he equated the attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union toward disarmament. He said: "It seems extraordinary that those great powers should argue about the priority of these two issues (referring to disarmament and the supervision of disarmament) and treat this as a reason for not moving forward."

Nehru expressed his desire to maintain the territorial integrity of the Congo and oppose foreign interference in the Congo's internal affairs. However, he opposed "weakening" the role of the UN executive bodies and favored authorizing the UN Secretary-General to continue taking action in the Congo.

Nehru acknowledged that the structure of the United Nations, even at its founding, was more favorable to European and American countries than to Asian and African countries, and that "today, this structure is even more unbalanced." But he opposed the Soviet proposal to replace the UN Secretary-General with a troika.

Nehru called on the UN General Assembly to pass the proposal of five countries, India, Indonesia, Yugoslavia, the United Arab Republic, and Ghana, requesting Eisenhower and Khrushchev to resume contact.

In his speech, Nehru advocated restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and expressed his support for the request to admit the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations.

UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld was the first to speak at the afternoon session. He flatly denied the fact that he has always been a tool of imperialism and colonialism, and tried his best to paint the United Nations organization, which the United States is using to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and undermine national independence movements, as a tool that small countries "need to protect themselves." Hammarskjöld brazenly stated that he does not intend to resign, but will continue to stay in office until his term expires in 1963.

Hungarian People's Republic delegation leader János Kádár then spoke, accusing representatives of NATO member states of concealing their arms expansion and war preparations with so-called "peace-loving" empty talk.

Kádár announced that the Hungarian delegation supports the Soviet proposal for the complete elimination of the colonial system.

Kádár then demanded the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and condemned the US policy on this issue. He also called for the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations.

Kádár strongly protested against putting the so-called "Hungarian question" on the General Assembly agenda. He pointed out that so far, the resolutions passed by the United Nations on the so-called "Hungarian question" are conspiracies to interfere in the internal affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic. The Hungarian people will never allow anyone to interfere in the internal affairs of their country.

Honduran representative Bermúdez said in his speech that the United States, "in violation of the rights and will of the Honduran people and government," occupied Swan Island off the coast of Honduras and set up a radio station there. Bermúdez said that his country is concerned about its sovereignty over these islands and improving its living standards.

The meeting finally turned to discussing whether to study the proposal put forward by five countries, Indonesia, India, Ghana, the United Arab Republic, and Yugoslavia, on requesting the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the US President to resume contact, and decided to start discussing this proposal on the 5th.

    联合国大会继续进行一般性辩论
    哥穆尔卡、赫鲁晓夫、卡达尔等在会上先后发言
    据新华社30日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会29日继续开会，进行一般性政治辩论。
    首先发言的是柬埔寨王国元首西哈努克亲王。西哈努克促请大会注意无视中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权的情况。他说，没有拥有差不多七亿人口的、国家威力正在不断增长的中国人民的合法代表参加国际会议，就不能解决重大国际问题。
    柬埔寨代表团团长对老挝局势表示不安。他指出，在老挝，外国鼓励，甚至支持反对万象的合法政府的暴乱计划越来越公开地暴露出来。他主张老挝中立，而且它的统一和领土完整要得到国际保障。
    西哈努克主张在东南亚建立由老挝和柬埔寨组成的中立区，以有利于维护和平。
    英国首相麦克米伦接着发言。他在发言中同美国总统艾森豪威尔在22日发表的演说相唱和，竭力支持艾森豪威尔所鼓吹的利用联合国来执行帝国主义的侵略阴谋。他认为应当“增加而不是削减”利用联合国来“对付可能发生危机的权力”。他表示反对苏联关于改组联合国组织和行政机构的建议，并且赞扬联合国在协助美国实现其鲸吞刚果的阴谋方面所起的作用。他说，英国政府认为，联合国在刚果的行动是“适时的，应该继续下去”。
    麦克米伦还公开为西德军国主义的复活辩护。麦克米伦硬说“根本不存在德国（西德）采取可能威胁和平的独立军事行动的问题”。他还攻击东欧社会主义国家代表对西方重新武装西德的政策的谴责是缺乏“和解的精神”。麦克米伦为西德军国主义充当辩护人的行动受到西德军国主义者的热烈欢迎。西德出席联大观察员卡尔·海因里希·克纳普施太因在麦克米伦讲话后立即去拜访麦克米伦，代表他的政府对麦克米伦的效劳表示非常满意。
    麦克米伦还提出了所谓解决裁军问题的“三个步骤”，但是他的所谓“三个步骤”不过是西方的有监督无裁军的方案的变种。他非常热心地鼓吹艾森豪威尔的为了进行间谍活动而提出的所谓“监督”计划，主张成立所谓专家小组来“提出建立公正和有效的监督的指导原则”。他胡说什么对其他国家进行间谍活动乃是“人情之常”。他并且创造了一个奇特的公式，叫作让“裁军”跟上“监督的步伐”。
    尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊在会议上发言时指出，在没有恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位之前，联合国不能成为具有真正普遍性的组织。他还指出，蒙古人民共和国也同样应该有合法的权利在联合国中占有自己的席位。
    柯伊拉腊还表示支持阿尔及利亚人民取得独立。柯伊拉腊认为必须保证刚果的领土完整和政治独立。
    昨天会议上发言的还有利比亚、巴基斯坦、奥地利和厄瓜多尔等国家的代表。
    据新华社2日讯　联合国大会9月30日继续进行一般性辩论。
    波兰人民共和国代表团团长哥穆尔卡首先在上午会议上发言，谴责英国首相麦克米伦29日在会议上公开为西德军国主义复活辩护的谬论。哥穆尔卡说，麦克米伦没有能够否认他所指出的关于西德军国主义化的任何一个事实。
    哥穆尔卡说，波兰政府和波兰的盟国已经不止一次地强调指出了波兰国界的不可改变的性质，麦克米伦应该明白，用军事手段修改这些边界的要求是多么严重。哥穆尔卡把英国首相目前的政策同张伯伦在第二次世界大战时的政策相比较，并严正谴责麦克米伦竟然把波兰看成是可以兑换的零钱，妄想用它来换取西德对英国在共同市场上的利益的支持。
    接着埃塞俄比亚和沙特阿拉伯代表发言，谴责殖民主义和帝国主义政策。
    捷克斯洛伐克外交部长戴维在下午会议上发言，严厉谴责英国首相麦克米伦在发言中为西德军国主义和复仇主义辩护。戴维指出，麦克米伦对西德帝国主义的态度使我们回想起他的一个前辈——张伯伦的态度。这位绅士的名字永远同可耻的慕尼黑协定联系在一起。
    印度尼西尼总统苏加诺接着发言，他表示遗憾不是所有的亚洲和非洲的国家都在联合国有代表，特别是一个古老的、英明和强大的国家没有代表。苏加诺说，我谈的是中国，这个中国经常被称作为共产党中国，对我们来说是唯一的中国。
    苏加诺谈到裁军问题时要求禁止核武器试验，实现真正的裁军。他着重指出，只要帝国主义存在，那怕完全实现了裁军协议也不能够保障持久和平。他说，西伊里安是针对印度尼西亚的一把殖民主义的剑。对和平的威胁的直接原因是殖民主义和帝国主义的存在。
    苏加诺表示支持阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争。
    苏加诺还详细地谈到作为印度尼西亚政策基础的“潘查希拉”五项原则。
    苏加诺说，联合国宪章并不反映今天的现实。接受五项原则将会巩固联合国宪章。苏加诺还说，联合国应当迁出冷战气氛的国家。他并且要求修改联合国宪章，重新考虑安理会和其他联合国机构中的席位的分配问题，以反映现代世界的真实局势。
    苏加诺接着谈到联合国没有找到解决西伊里安问题的办法。他指出，联合国是西方国家制度的产物。帝国主义和殖民主义是这一西方国家制度的结果。
    苏加诺最后以加纳、印度、阿拉伯联合共和国、南斯拉夫和印度尼西亚代表团的名义提出一项提案，建议为了有利于缓和国际紧张局势和解决重要的国际问题，大会应当要求苏联部长会议主席和美国总统恢复接触作为第一个步骤。苏加诺要求大会尽快地通过这一提案，并希望联合提案将在大会上获得一致通过。
    据新华社4日讯　联合国大会3日继续进行一般性辩论。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在上午会议上就改变联合国执行机构的结构问题首先发言。
    赫鲁晓夫解释了苏联代表团就联合国执行机构的作用和地位的问题的立场，他指出，联合国某些机构的结构现在已经过时。他说，重要的是，联合国要能够及时地扑灭战争火苗。要做到这一点，只有考虑到所有三个国家集团的利益，同时也考虑到殖民地人民的利益。他说，我们希望联合国真正成为这样一种机构，在这个机构里，加入联合国的一切国家集团的利益都在同样程度上得到考虑和保护。
    赫鲁晓夫还要求采取实际措施实现全面和彻底裁军。赫鲁晓夫还说，殖民主义制度现在已经过时。我们的责任就是要尽快埋葬这具霉烂的尸体，从而澄清气氛，在世界上创造对全人类说来过较好的生活的条件。
    赫鲁晓夫强调苏联人民对正在争取解放的人民的支持。他说，如果有人认为这是一个反叛的号召，那么我将引以为豪，并且声称：苏联爱好自由的人民对那些起来反对殖民主义者、争取自己的自由和独立的人民伸出援助之手。
    赫鲁晓夫最后表示相信和平的事业终将在全世界取得胜利。
    印度总理尼赫鲁发了言。尼赫鲁说，裁军是今天世界上的首要问题，对此不能容忍任何拖延。但是他把美国和苏联对裁军的态度等量齐观。他说：“那些大国竟然对于这两个问题（指裁军和对裁军的监督）的优先地位进行争辩，并且把这当作不继续前进的理由，这看来似乎是异乎寻常的。”
    尼赫鲁表示要维护刚果领土的完整和反对外国对刚果内政进行干涉。但是，他反对“削弱”联合国执行机构的作用，并赞成授权联合国秘书长继续在刚果采取行动。
    尼赫鲁承认，联合国的结构，甚至在它成立的时候就对欧洲和美洲国家比对亚洲和非洲的国家更为有利，而“今天，这个结构就甚至更加不平衡了”。但是他反对苏联提出的以三人委员会代替联合国秘书长职务的建议。
    尼赫鲁要求联合国大会通过印度、印度尼西亚、南斯拉夫、阿拉伯联合共和国、加纳五国要求艾森豪威尔和赫鲁晓夫恢复接触的提案。
    尼赫鲁在发言中主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，并且表示支持接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国的要求。
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在下午会议上第一个发言。他一口否认他一向是帝国主义和殖民主义的工具的事实，并且竭力把美国正在用来干涉其他国家的内政和破坏民族独立运动的联合国组织粉饰为弱小国家“需要用来保障自己”的工具。哈马舍尔德厚颜无耻地表示，他不打算辞职，而要继续赖到1963年任期届满为止。
    匈牙利人民共和国代表团团长卡达尔接着发言，他指责北大西洋集团成员国的代表以所谓“爱好和平”的空谈来掩饰它们的扩军备战活动。
    卡达尔宣布，匈牙利代表团支持苏联关于彻底消灭殖民主义制度的建议。
    卡达尔接着要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利，并且谴责美国在这个问题上的政策。他还要求接纳蒙古人民共和国参加联合国。
    卡达尔强烈抗议把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入大会议程。他指出，到目前为止，联合国所通过的关于所谓“匈牙利问题”的决议正是干涉匈牙利人民共和国内政的阴谋。匈牙利人民决不允许任何人干涉他们的国家的内政。
    洪都拉斯代表贝尔穆德斯在发言时指责美国在“违反洪都拉斯人民和政府的权利和意志的情况下”占领了洪都拉斯沿海岸的天鹅岛，在那里设立了一个电台。贝尔穆德斯说，他的国家关心它对这些岛屿的主权以及提高它的生活水平。
    会议最后转而讨论是否研究印度尼西亚、印度、加纳、阿拉伯联合共和国和南斯拉夫五国提出的关于要求苏联部长会议主席和美国总统恢复接触的提案，并且决定到5日才开始讨论这个提案。
