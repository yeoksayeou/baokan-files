    Wuhan, October 28 (Reporter): Hubei Province is focusing on the quality of sowing on newly reclaimed land during the autumn planting production campaign, striving to achieve a summer harvest next year that is as bountiful as that from cultivated land.

    Hubei Province's planned autumn planting area this year exceeds any year in history. Of the province's expanded planting area, in addition to some paddy fields and previously fallow dry land, the rest is newly reclaimed wasteland. Therefore, ensuring the sowing quality of wasteland, while planting cultivated land well on a large scale, is of utmost importance for balancing and increasing production in the summer harvest next year.

    To ensure the quality of sowing on newly reclaimed wasteland, all localities adhere to the system based on production teams, earnestly implement the wasteland revenue distribution policy, thereby inspiring the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members and greatly promoting the planting of wasteland. The Shuguang Production Team of the Changbanpo People's Commune in Dangyang County, because it conscientiously implemented the various policies of not contracting output for newly reclaimed areas this year in the autumn planting "three guarantees" (guarantee area, guarantee quality, and guarantee the season), with 70% of the harvest going to the team and 30% going to the production brigade, quickly set off an upsurge in autumn planting that guaranteed the season, area, and quality. The team planned to apply 80,000 dan of autumn planting base fertilizer, of which more than 40,000 dan have been completed, and more than 300 mu of the 518 mu of newly reclaimed wasteland have been meticulously cultivated and finely tilled. Some fields have been planted with broad beans, and the sowing quality is basically catching up with the level of cultivated land. At the same time, all localities have also criticized the idea that "wasteland cannot produce high yields" and the thinking of emphasizing cultivated land and neglecting wasteland, resulting in extensive planting and thin harvests, by summarizing the typical experiences of increasing production on wasteland, laying an ideological foundation for planting wasteland well.

    To make wasteland yield as much as cultivated land, the first step is to improve the poor soil quality of wasteland. All localities have particularly emphasized specific measures such as meticulous cultivation and fine tilling, increasing fertilizer application, and improving water conservancy facilities in the sowing of wasteland. The people's communes in Sui County have adopted measures of early soil sun exposure and early re-tillage for newly reclaimed wasteland, increasing the weathering time of the barren soil. They also broke and felled small sunning ditches in hillside fields and edges of paddy fields according to different soil qualities; large sunning ditches for green mud fields and slurry-containing soil, and rake and crush small sunning ditches for sandy soil, so that the quality of land cultivation and tillage in the county was fast and good. The Chengma Commune in Macheng County, through discussions with commune members, set the precise and tidy standards of "three ploughings, three raking, five inches of deep plowing, and application of fifty dan of high-quality base fertilizer per mu" for newly reclaimed land, so that more than 80,000 mu of newly reclaimed land in the commune reached the standard of cultivated land.

    Increasing the application of high-quality fertilizer is an extremely important measure for making wasteland catch up with cultivated land. Before autumn planting, all localities launched a vigorous campaign to accumulate, produce, and transport fertilizer. Yun County, in conjunction with wasteland reclamation and tillage, utilized wasteland weeds to burn and rot on the spot, accumulating and producing more than 11 million dan of high-quality fire fertilizer for wasteland fields. The Hongshan Commune in Yingshan County, in addition to applying sufficient base fertilizer, also specially accumulated 3.18 million dan of plant ash and fire soil fertilizer as seed-covering fertilizer based on the characteristics of the barren and loose topsoil of wasteland, promoting early seedling emergence.

    All localities have also rationally arranged the crop stubble of wasteland according to the quality of the soil. Generally, wheat crops are planted in paddy fields and sandy wasteland, and bean and rapeseed crops are planted in shallow mountain ridges and yellow soil wasteland. Such rational utilization of land fertility creates conditions for catching up with the yields of similar crops on cultivated land. Some places have also adopted measures such as watering and sowing, seizing moisture for sowing, and sowing wasteland before sowing cultivated land, based on the characteristics that wasteland has poor moisture and the soil is not loose, making it difficult for seeds to combine with the soil, promoting early emergence of seeds. The Mazhuang Production Team of the Yangdang Commune in Zaoyang County has now prepared 40,000 jin of cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer for the sown wasteland, and will carry out cultivation and management as early as possible after the seedlings emerge.

    Leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the front lines of sowing, launched mass movements on a large scale, making the province's autumn planting production proceed quickly and well. The Wuhan area concentrated superior forces to carry out the autumn planting campaign of "three guarantees" (guarantee the season, guarantee the area, guarantee the quality) and "four catches up" (paddy fields catch up with dry land, miscellaneous grains catch up with staple grains, mountain ridges catch up with plains, and distant fields catch up with nearby fields), focusing on the sowing quality of paddy fields and newly reclaimed wasteland. As of the 14th of this month, the area had sown 3.5 million mu of grain crops, 50,000 mu of rapeseed, and 25 mu of green manure, all of which were of good quality. To ensure the quality of wasteland sowing, leading cadres at all levels also ran model wasteland sowing fields with commune members. Some places also contracted wasteland to work groups, establishing a responsibility system to ensure sowing quality, ensure cultivation and management, and ensure increased production and bumper harvests, making the current autumn planting work more solid and meticulous.

### 精耕细整增施肥料　合理安排秋播茬口  要荒地和熟地比翼高飞  湖北各级领导干部深入第一线狠抓新垦荒地播种质量

    精耕细整增施肥料　合理安排秋播茬口
    要荒地和熟地比翼高飞
    湖北各级领导干部深入第一线狠抓新垦荒地播种质量
    本报武汉28日电　湖北各地在秋播生产运动中，狠抓新开荒地的播种质量，力争与熟地一样地获得明年夏季丰收。
    湖北省今年秋播计划面积，超过历史上任何一年。在全省扩大的播种面积中，除一部分水田和过去冬闲的旱地以外，其余是新开荒地。因此，在种好大面积熟地的前提下，保证荒地的播种质量，对于明年夏收平衡增产，具有极其重要的意义。
    为了保证新开荒地的播种质量，各地坚持以生产队为基础的体制，认真贯彻荒地收益分配政策，从而启发了广大社员群众的生产积极性，对种好荒地起了很大的促进作用。当阳县长坂坡人民公社曙光生产队，由于在秋种“三包”中，认真执行了今年开荒面积不包产，收获70％归小队、30％归生产队等各项政策，很快就掀起了保季节、保面积、保质量的秋播高潮。全队计划八万担秋播底肥，已完成四万多担，新开荒地五百一十八亩，有三百多亩进行了精耕细整，并有部分田已播上了蚕豆，播种质量基本上赶上了熟田的水平。同时，各地还通过总结荒地增产的典型经验，批判了认为“荒地不能高产”和重熟轻荒的广种薄收的思想，为种好荒地打下了思想基础。
    要使荒地与熟地一样的获得丰收，首先是改良荒地土质瘠薄的状况。各地在荒地播种中，特别强调了精耕细整、增施肥料、改善水利设施等项具体措施。随县各人民公社对新开荒地采取早炕田、早复整的措施，增加了荒土的风化时间。他们还根据不同土质，分别在冲地深翻大炕，塝田、梢冲田（即冲田的边沿）破伐小炕；青泥田、含浆土要大炕，油沙土则耙碎小炕，使全县荒地耕整质量又快又好。麻城县乘马公社通过社员讨论，对新开荒地，订出了“三三五五”（耕三道、耙三道、深翻五寸、每亩施五十担优质底肥）的精整规格，使全社八万多亩开荒新地达到了熟地标准。
    增施优质肥料，是使荒地赶上熟地的一项极为重要的措施。各地在秋播以前，就开展了轰轰烈烈的积肥、造肥、送肥运动。郧县结合开荒整地，利用荒地杂草，就地烧沤，为荒田积造了一千一百多万担优质火粪。英山县红山公社除施足底肥以外，还根据荒地上层土壤瘠薄不疏松的特点，又专门积造了三百一十八万担草木灰、火土粪作盖籽肥，促使苗子早出土。
    各地还根据土质好坏，合理安排了荒地的作物茬口。一般都是冲地和油沙荒地种麦类作物，土层浅的山岗地和黄土荒地种豆类、油菜作物。这样合理利用地力，培养地力，就为赶上熟地的同类作物的产量创造了条件。有的地方还根据荒地墒薄土壤不松，种子不易与土壤结合等特点，采取浇水播种，抢墒播种和先播荒地后播熟地等措施，促使种子早出苗。枣阳县杨垱公社马庄生产队，现在已经为播种的荒地备下了四万斤饼肥和化肥，等苗子出土后，便及早进行培育管理。
    各级领导干部纷纷深入播种第一线，大搞群众运动，使全省秋播生产进行得又快又好。武汉地区集中优势兵力，开展“三保”（保季节、保面积、保质量）“四赶”（水田赶旱地、杂粮赶主粮、山岗赶平原、远田赶近田）的秋播运动，主攻水田和新垦荒地的播种质量，到本月14日止，全区已播种了粮食作物三百五十万亩，油菜五万亩，绿肥二十五亩，质量都很好。为了保证荒地播种质量，各级领导干部还和社员一道办了荒地播种样板田。有的地方还将荒地包到作业组，建立保播种质量，保培育管理，保增产丰收的责任制，使当前秋播工作做得更扎实细致。
