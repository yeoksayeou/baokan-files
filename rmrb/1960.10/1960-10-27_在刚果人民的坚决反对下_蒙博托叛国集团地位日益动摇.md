    Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: Leopoldville dispatch: Under the opposition of the Congolese people, the position of the Mobutu traitor group, supported by Western imperialist countries, is becoming more and more shaky and unstable. It is reported that following the incident in Stanleyville where the Congolese army arrested several officers sent by Mobutu for conspiratorial activities, a similar mutiny against the Mobutu group occurred in the Coquilhatville area. Mobutu has hurriedly rushed there. The Associated Press said that he may be going to make a "desperate effort" to "try to gather the collapsing army together."
    On the evening of the 22nd, conflicts occurred between the people and Mobutu's army in the suburbs of Leopoldville. Some people were killed and wounded by the reactionary army. The shaking of Mobutu's position has made the United States extremely embarrassed and uneasy. An Associated Press dispatch from the United Nations headquarters on the 23rd admitted that the United States had given Mobutu "private" support in the past. The United States has been giving "careful assistance and advice" to those "Congolese diplomats who have recently been in contact with Mobutu."

    在刚果人民的坚决反对下
    蒙博托叛国集团地位日益动摇
    据新华社24日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：在刚果人民的反对下，为西方帝国主义国家支持的蒙博托叛国集团的地位愈来愈动摇和不稳。据报道，继斯坦利维尔的刚果军队逮捕了蒙博托派去那里进行阴谋活动的几名军官的事件以后，在科基尔哈特维尔地区发生了类似的反对蒙博托集团的兵变。蒙博托已经匆匆赶往那里。美联社说，他可能是去作一次“企图把溃散的军队聚集在一起”的“拼命努力”。
    利奥波德维尔的郊区22日晚上，发生了人民同蒙博托的军队冲突的事件。有些人被反动军队打死打伤。蒙博托地位的动摇使美国极为狼狈不安。美联社23日从联合国总部发出的一条消息承认，过去美国给了蒙博托“私下的”支持。美国一直在给予那些“最近一直同蒙博托保持联系的刚果外交家们以慎重的援助和劝告”。
