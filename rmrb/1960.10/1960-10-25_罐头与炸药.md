    Canned Goods and Explosives
    Kang Hui
    The American devils fled the Korean battlefield,
    Leaving behind piles and piles of canned goods,
    Hiding the seeds of death,
    Leaving them to the burned-down villages.
    Mother came back from the mountains,
    Digging through the ashes in the ruins, moving broken beams,
    Holding onto a glimmer of hope,
    Futilely searching for the grain jar.
    Little Jin'e was crying beside her,
    Tears streaming from her eyes,
    Oh! She was attracted by the canned goods:
    The wrapper was printed with strings of sausages.
    Little Jin'e moved her little feet,
    The English letters grinned at her,
    Alas! How could the young mind know,
    That hidden there was a vicious heart!
    "Stop! Little Jin'e!"
    Mother shouted in a panic,
    But it was already too late,
    The black detonator had already been touched off by her!
    A violent explosion,
    Little Jin'e fell to the ground,
    Her pale face splattered with
    The sausage's red, broken filling...
    Kind people, remember this!
    Remember this tragic scene,
    A scene that American bandits are staging all over the world:
    Enticing bait concealing a sinister plot!

    罐头与炸药
    亢辉
    美国鬼子从朝鲜战场上逃走了，
    扔下成堆成堆的罐头箱，
    藏着死亡的种籽，
    留给烧毁的村庄。
    阿妈尼从山里回来，
    在废墟里刨开灰烬，挪走断梁，
    抱着一线希望，
    徒劳地寻找粮缸。
    小金娥在一旁哭泣，
    眼泪从眼睛里流淌，
    噢噢！她被罐头吸引了：
    封纸上印着一串串香肠。
    小金娥迈动双脚了，
    英文字母在向她狞笑，
    唉！幼小的心灵怎知道，
    那儿藏的是毒辣的心肠！
    “快站住！小金娥！”
    阿妈尼慌忙喊叫，
    可是已经来不及了，
    那黑色的雷管已被她碰响！
    一声剧烈的爆炸，
    小金娥倒在地上，
    惨白的脸蛋溅满了
    香肠的红色的碎馕……
    善良的人们，记住吧！
    记住这悲惨的一幕，
    这一幕，美国强盗正在全世界串演：
    诱人的钓饵包藏着罪恶的勾当！
