    Cadres of Hupu People's Commune in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, Go Deep into the Front Lines
    Consulting with the Masses on Matters, Leading Production More Solidly
    (Our correspondents Sun Zhen, Gu Ping, and Chun Guang report) The cadres at all levels of Hupu People's Commune in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, based on eating, living, and laboring together with the commune members, have further implemented the Party's mass line policy, consulting with the masses on all matters. This makes the cadres' leadership of production more solid, ensures that every step is accurate, and that everything is grasped at the key points.
    Party Resolutions Become the Conscious Actions of the Masses
    Since this spring, Hupu Commune has conscientiously implemented the "Four Togethers," and the leadership style has greatly improved, resulting in a new situation of sustained leap forward in various tasks. However, some cadres, after arriving at the front line, remained superficial and did not go deep; they were among the masses all day long, but failed to deeply discover problems and did not take root among the masses. The Commune Party Committee, in response to these situations, specifically discussed the issue of improving the cadres' work style four times. They summarized the experiences and lessons learned from the previous stage of improving work style and realized from practice that cadres going to the front line is only the first step in going deep into reality and deep among the masses. They generally realized that after clarifying the Party's policies, the key to how to implement them among the masses lies in being good at consulting with the masses, consulting with the brigade and team cadres, and consulting with the commune members. The Commune Party Secretary and Party Committee members spend more than two-thirds of their time living in the production teams, helping with work, and participating in labor. When they go to the production teams to help with work, their first priority is to help the production team cadres learn to consult with the masses. Now, when many production team cadres summarize their experience in doing good work, they always regard "consulting with the masses on all matters" as an important experience.
    At a Party member meeting of the Sixth Production Team, the situation of the three types of cotton seedlings was analyzed, and methods for eliminating the three types of seedlings were discussed. The branch raised the following question: What should be done first after the meeting? The attendees were asked to discuss it. Everyone unanimously agreed: The first thing to do after the meeting is to consult with the masses. Only in this way can the Party's resolutions be transformed into the conscious actions of the broad masses.
    After the meeting, cadres and Party members used labor and rest time to talk to the commune members about the situation of the three types of seedlings, the relationship between eliminating the three types of seedlings and the country, the collective, and the individual, and how to eliminate the three types of seedlings according to different situations. The Fourth Team had the most three types of seedlings, mainly because the team leader's leadership style was poor, and he did not put his heart into the cotton fields, which affected the enthusiasm of the commune members. In order to eliminate the three types of seedlings, Zhang Manman, the deputy secretary of the branch, stayed in this team to help with work and took the lead in labor. During the labor, he helped the team cadres change their leadership style, and the commune members quickly took action. The men carried manure for topdressing, and the women weeded and loosened the soil. In three days, they completed the processing of more than seventy mu of three types of seedlings. A week later, the three types of seedlings turned from yellow to green, surpassing the two types of seedlings.
    Making Friends and Pooling Ideas
    The Commune Party Secretary and Committee members have also made many close friends among the masses. These close friends are all "three-good" commune members who are good in class background, good in ideology, and good in labor. Among them are Party members, Youth League members, men and women, old and young. Each secretary and committee member has a registration form of close friends. They are familiar with everyone on the form, just like they are familiar with their own relatives, knowing their personality, their special skills, how they labor, etc. Currently, the thirteen secretaries and committee members have made a total of one hundred and forty-eight close friends. The brigade and team cadres have made even more close friends.
    When cadres have close friends, they can understand the demands of the broad masses in a timely manner, better consult with the broad masses, and smoothly complete various tasks. When encountering difficulties, they will receive the support of the masses, and some unrealistic ideas will be corrected by the masses. Xu Jinhua, Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, planted a 40-mu high-yield cotton plot in the Sixth Brigade. When the cotton grew to more than a foot high, he prepared to apply heavy topdressing. His close friends Ni Zengyuan and Zhang Xiaohei, after learning about it, came to Xu Jinhua and said: "Lao Xu, you don't know that this plot of land used to grow rice for seven or eight years, and this year's previous crop was rapeseed. The land is fertile, and the seedlings grow quickly. If you apply too much fertilizer, the cotton will grow wildly!" Xu Jinhua accepted this opinion and changed his original idea. After Xu Jinhua reported the opinions of the commune members to the Commune Party Committee, a campaign of skillful application of topdressing was launched throughout the commune.
    Consulting Together in Front of Examples
    In August, there was a heavy rain of more than 200 millimeters, and the leaves of cotton in more than 5,000 mu of cotton fields in the entire commune turned yellow. The Commune Party Committee believed that topdressing must be applied immediately, but some cadres and the masses believed that the cotton had already formed bolls, and topdressing would not have any effect. After repeated studies, the Party Committee considered that in the past, there had also been cases of cotton leaves turning yellow after heavy rains. If some examples of significant results from topdressing could be found, the masses would consciously implement the measures proposed by the Party Committee. In order to find examples to facilitate consultation with the masses, the Party Secretary and Committee members went to the production teams to investigate and study.
    The Sixth Team had two adjacent cotton fields, both of which had accumulated water. The cotton leaves in the southern field had already turned yellow, while the cotton in the northern field was still green and lush, full of vitality. The other conditions of these two fields were the same, except that the base fertilizer and topdressing in the southern field were not as much as in the northern field, which shows that the yellowing of cotton after rain is closely related to insufficient fertility.
    The Commune Party Committee used this example to consult with the masses, which was more convincing than general mobilization, and those who had fixed ideas were quickly convinced. A mass upsurge of shock topdressing was launched throughout the commune, and yellow manure was generally applied to the affected cotton fields in three days. A week later, the yellowed cotton grew new green leaves again.
    Cadres and the Masses Are Even Closer
    The cadres of Hupu Commune not only consult with the masses on major production matters, but also consult with the masses on livelihood issues. Have the canteens and nurseries been run well? What is the situation of combining labor and rest for the commune members? Has sanitation been done well? How are the commune members' private plots planted? And the births, deaths, and illnesses of the masses, etc., have all become the content of their consultations with the masses.
    Ji Hongtian, a poor peasant commune member of the Fifth Team of the Second Brigade, proposed at a recent discussion meeting: Now that every household is using the open space in front of and behind their houses to grow vegetables, commune members should be allowed to keep some fertilizer. Ji Hongtian's opinion reflected the demands of the masses. After the team cadres consulted with the masses, they announced at the commune members' meeting that day that each household would be allowed to keep three dan of manure to fertilize the vegetables. The commune members were all satisfied. The next day, more than 200 households in the team used their spare time to hoe the ground and grow vegetables.
    Hupu Town used to be a smelly fishing port, with three stenches all year round: the stench of fish, the stench of feces, and the stench of sewage. Every summer and autumn, flies flew around, mosquitoes swarmed, and epidemics spread. The commune relied on the masses, consulted with the masses, and launched a patriotic health campaign. Men, women, old and young, all took action to eliminate pests and diseases and tried every means to transform the smelly fishing port. Today, Hupu Town has completely eliminated flies and mosquitoes, the fishing port has no fishy smell, and diseases such as typhoid and malaria have been eradicated. More than 100,000 trees have been planted throughout the town, and more than 100 new small flower gardens have been opened up in front of and behind the houses, beautifying the environment. Many people have written door couplets such as "Disease and disaster do not stain the clean land, and happiness often comes to the healthy home." The former smelly fishing port has become a national advanced unit in sanitation.
    The more cadres care about the masses, the more the masses regard the cadres as "clothing that clings to the flesh" and "intimate confidants," and the more they care for and consider the cadres. When they see that the cadres have been working for a long time, they urge the cadres to rest. When the canteen makes fresh dishes, they always pull the cadres to taste them together. This close relationship between cadres and the masses can generate a stream of heat, promoting production and various tasks forward.

    江苏常熟县浒浦人民公社干部深入第一线
    遇事同群众商量领导生产更加踏实
    本报讯　记者孙振、古平、春光报道：江苏省常熟县浒浦人民公社各级干部，在和社员同吃、同住、同劳动的基础上，进一步贯彻党的群众路线方针，遇事和群众商量，使干部领导生产更为踏实，步步走得准，样样抓在关键上。
    党的决议变成群众自觉行动
    今年春季以来，浒浦公社认真地贯彻“四同”，领导作风有了很大改进，各项工作出现了持续跃进的新局面。但有一部分干部到了第一线后，深而不入；成天在群众中、却不能深入地发现问题，没有在群众中扎下根来。公社党委针对这些情况，对改进干部作风问题专门讨论过四次。他们总结了前一阶段改进作风的经验教训，从实践中认识到干部到了第一线，只不过是深入实际、深入群众的第一步。他们普遍体会到在明确了党的方针政策以后，如何在群众中贯彻执行，就要善于同群众商量，同大队小队干部商量，同社员群众商量。公社党委书记和党委委员们，都以三分之二以上的时间住在生产队帮助工作和参加劳动。他们到生产队帮助工作，首先也是帮助生产队干部学会和群众同商量。现在，许多生产队的干部在总结自己做好工作的经验时，总是把“有事和群众同商量”看做一条重要经验。
    在第六生产队的一次党员会议上，分析棉花三类苗的情况，讨论消灭三类苗的办法。支部提出了这样一个问题：会后第一件事做什么？要求到会党员进行讨论。大家一致意见：会后第一件事情就是和群众同商量。只有这样，才能把党的决议，变成广大群众的自觉行动。
    会后，干部和党员利用劳动和休息时间，分别和社员交谈三类苗的情况，消灭三类苗对国家、集体和个人的关系，怎样根据不同的情况消灭三类苗。四小队三类苗最多，主要原因是小队长领导作风不好，没有把心思用在棉花地里，影响了社员的积极性。为了消灭三类苗，支部副书记张满满住到这个小队帮助工作，带头劳动，在劳动中帮助小队干部改变了领导作风，社员们很快行动起来，男的挑粪追肥，女的锄草松土，三天就完成了七十多亩三类苗的加工任务。一个星期以后，三类苗就转黄为青，超过了二类苗。
    交朋友集思广益
    公社党委书记和委员们还在群众中结交了很多知心朋友。这些知心朋友都是成份好、思想好、劳动好的“三好”社员。其中有党员，有团员，有男有女，有老有少。每个书记和委员身边都有一张知心朋友的登记表。他们熟悉表格上的每一个人，就像熟悉自己的亲人一样，什么性格，什么特长，劳动怎样等等。目前，十三个书记和委员一共交了一百四十八个知心朋友。大队和小队干部交结的知心朋友就更多了。
    干部有了知心朋友，就能够及时了解广大群众的要求，更好地和广大群众同商量，顺利地完成各项任务。遇到困难的时候，会得到群众的支持，某些不切实际的主张，会得到群众的纠正。公社党委副书记徐金华在六大队种了一块四十亩棉花丰产片。在棉花长到一尺多高时，准备重施追肥。他的知心朋友倪增元，张小黑知道以后，就赶来对徐金华说：“老徐，你不知道这片田过去种了七、八年水稻，今年前作又是油菜，地力肥，发棵快，再多追肥料，棉花就要疯长啦！”徐金华接受了这个意见，改变了原来的主张。徐金华把社员意见向公社党委汇报以后，全社开展了巧施追肥的运动。
    样子面前同商量
    8月份，下了一场二百多公厘的大雨，全公社有五千多亩棉田的棉花叶子发黄。公社党委认为必须立即追肥，但部分干部和群众认为棉花都结铃了，追肥不起什么作用。党委经过多次研究，考虑到从前也发生过大雨过后棉叶发黄的情况，要是能找到一些追肥取得显著效果的实例，群众就能自觉地贯彻党委提出的措施了。为了找出样子，便于同群众商量，党委书记和委员们分头到生产队里去调查研究。
    第六小队有两块连在一起的棉田，田里都积了水。南边田里的棉花叶子已经变黄，北边田里的棉花却仍然是青枝绿叶，生机旺盛。这两块田其它条件都一样，就是南边田里的基肥和追肥都赶不上北边田里的多，由此可见棉花雨后发黄和肥力不足有很大关系。
    公社党委运用这个实例，去和群众商量，这比一般的动员就有了更大的说服力，有定局思想的人也很快心服了。全公社掀起了群众性的突击追肥高潮，三天时间就在受灾的棉田里普遍施了一次黄粪。一个星期以后，发黄的棉花又都长出了青绿的嫩叶。
    干部群众亲又亲
    浒浦公社的干部不但生产大事和群众商量，生活问题也做到了和群众商量。食堂、托儿所有没有办好？社员劳逸结合的情况如何？清洁卫生有没有搞好？社员的自留地种得怎样？以及群众的生老病死等等，都成为他们和群众商量的内容。
    第二大队第五小队贫农社员季洪田在最近的一次座谈会上提出：现在每家每户都利用家前屋后的空地种蔬菜，应该让社员留一部分肥料。季洪田的意见反映了群众的要求。小队干部和群众商量后，当天就在社员大会上宣布每家留三担粪肥浇菜。社员们个个满意。第二天，全队二百多户社员都利用空余时间锄地种菜。
    浒浦镇原来是个臭渔港，一年四季有三臭：鱼腥臭，粪便臭，污水臭。每到夏秋季节，蝇乱飞，蚊成群，疫病流行。公社依靠群众，和群众商量，开展爱国卫生运动，男女老少人人动手除害灭病，千方百计改造臭渔港。如今浒浦镇已经彻底消灭了苍蝇蚊虫，渔港没有鱼腥，伤寒、疟疾等疾病已经根除。全镇植树十多万棵，家前屋后新辟小花圃一百多处，美化了环境。许多群众写上了“病灾不染清洁地，幸福常临健康家”的门对联。原来的臭渔港成了全国的卫生先进单位。
    干部越关心群众，群众也就越把干部当成“着肉布衫”、“贴心的知己”，对干部也就更加关怀体贴。他们见干部劳动时间长了，就催干部休息。食堂里做了新鲜菜，总要拉着干部一起去尝尝。干部群众这样亲密的关系，就能产生一股热流，推动着生产和各项工作前进。
