Everyone Get Involved: Harvest Autumn Vegetables Well, Store Autumn Vegetables Well

　　This year's autumn vegetable production has demonstrated broad popular participation. Several months ago, the people of urban and rural areas across the country responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council and launched a campaign to plant autumn vegetables on a large scale. Rural people's communes adopted methods such as intercropping grain and vegetables, cultivating wasteland for planting vegetables, and using scattered plots of land to plant melons and vegetables, thereby expanding the autumn vegetable planting area.机关、学校、企业、部队和街道居民组织 in cities and industrial and mining areas, on the one hand, mobilized a large number of people to go to the countryside to help rural areas with crash-planting vegetables, and on the other hand, tried their best to make use of various vacant spaces such as roadsides, housesides, and courtyards to plant vegetables extensively. Everyone get involved, the whole people plant vegetables, forming a new and excellent atmosphere in vegetable work. We should make persistent efforts, strengthen the late-stage field management of autumn vegetables, strive for a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables, and harvest, store, and use all autumn vegetables well.

　　The more you plant, the more you harvest. If everyone participates in planting, then everyone must participate in storing. Experience over the years has proven that vegetable work is a work with broad popular participation, and it is the common responsibility of producers, sellers, and consumers to do this work well. Everyone has to eat vegetables, and everyone should care about the production, transportation, and sales of vegetables. This is even more true for autumn vegetables. Autumn vegetables have the largest quantity, the shortest harvest period, and the longest storage period; harvesting, transportation, storage, and processing require a lot of manpower, equipment, and materials. This series of tasks cannot be done well by production units and commercial departments alone; it is necessary to combine the work of relevant departments with the efforts of the broad masses. On the one hand, we must advocate close cooperation between commerce, agriculture, transportation and other departments to strive to improve the management and administration of vegetables; on the other hand, we must mobilize the broad masses in urban and rural areas to get involved, everyone contribute, harvest more autumn vegetables, and store more autumn vegetables.

　　Harvesting autumn vegetables values timeliness. The weather in late autumn is changeable, and a severe frost can reduce the harvest of some vegetables by several tenths. Therefore, we should organize the necessary manpower and arrange sufficient harvesting tools and transportation vehicles according to local climatic conditions and vegetable growth, so as to ensure that vegetables can be harvested in a timely manner. It is better to harvest slightly earlier than to miss the opportunity. Taking it easy allows for more careful harvesting. Whether centrally planted or sporadically planted, everything should be harvested and picked clean, and even vegetable leaves and stems should not be left behind.

　　Storing autumn vegetables is a major event. Some vegetables are suitable for fresh storage, and some vegetables should be processed (dried vegetables, pickled vegetables, sauerkraut, etc.). Whether fresh storage or processing, everyone should be mobilized to participate. In rural areas, focus on public canteens to arrange the storage of vegetables needed for this winter and next spring. If necessary, we can consider implementing a method of unified canteen management and storage by each household to avoid losses that may be caused by excessive centralized storage. In urban and industrial and mining areas, in addition to commercial institutions strengthening vegetable storage, collective meal units and street residents should also be organized to store vegetables themselves. It is easy for each household to store one hundred catties of vegetables. If everyone does this, it can greatly reduce the workload of commercial departments and enable them to store the part they directly manage better.

　　The distribution and consumption of vegetables should be planned. In cities and industrial and mining areas, the vegetable production and storage situation can be explained to residents, calling on everyone to plan their vegetable consumption, use sparingly, and strive to reduce the imbalance between excessive consumption in the peak season and insufficient consumption in the off-season.

　　Harvesting, storing, and using vegetables well plays an extremely important role in arranging the lives of urban and rural people. We should arrange vegetables in the same way as we arrange grain. As long as everyone is mobilized to participate in this matter, vegetables can be arranged as well as grain.

### 大家动手　收好秋菜　存好秋菜

    大家动手　收好秋菜　存好秋菜
    今年的秋菜生产表现了广大群众性。几个月以前，全国城乡人民响应中共中央和国务院的号召，掀起了大种秋菜的运动。农村人民公社采用粮菜间作、开荒种菜、利用零星土地点瓜种菜等办法，扩大了秋菜种植面积。城市和工矿区的机关、学校、企业、部队和街道居民组织，一方面发动大批人员下乡，帮助农村突击种菜，一方面尽量利用路边、宅旁、庭院等各种空隙地广种蔬菜。大家动手，全民种菜，形成蔬菜工作中大好的新气象。我们应该再接再厉，加强秋菜后期田间管理，争取秋菜丰收，并且把所有秋菜都收获好，储藏好，使用好。
    种的多，收的就多。大家动手种植，就要大家动手收藏。几年来的经验证明了，蔬菜工作是一项具有广泛群众性的工作，做好这项工作，是生产者、销售者、消费者的共同责任。人人都要吃菜，人人都应当关心蔬菜的生产、运输、销售。对于秋菜，更要这样。秋菜数量最大，收获期最短，储存期最长；收获、运输、储藏、加工，需要大量人力、设备和器材。这一系列的工作，单靠生产单位和商业部门是做不好的；必须把有关部门的工作和广大群众的努力结合起来。一方面，要提倡商业、农业、运输等部门密切协作，努力改善蔬菜的经营管理；一方面要把城乡广大群众发动起来，大家动手，人人出力，多收秋菜，多储秋菜。
    收获秋菜，贵乎适时，晚秋气候多变，一场严重的霜冻，可使某些蔬菜减少几成收成。所以应该根据当地的气候条件和蔬菜生长情况，组织必要的人力，安排足够的收获用具和运输工具，作到保证能够及时把蔬菜收回来。宁可收获稍早，不可失之过迟。从容一些才能收得细致。不论集中种植的，还是零星种植的，都要收光拣净，即使菜帮、茎叶都不应当遗留。
    储藏秋菜是件大事。有些蔬菜宜于鲜储，有些蔬菜应该加工（晒干菜、腌咸菜、渍酸菜等等）。无论鲜储或加工，都要发动大家动手。在农村，主要以公共食堂为中心，安排今冬明春所需要的蔬菜的储存工作。如有必要，可以考虑实行食堂统一管理、各户代为储存的方法，借以避免过分集中储存可能遭受的损失。在城市和工矿区，除了商业机构加强蔬菜储存工作以外，更要组织集体伙食单位和街道居民自己动手，储存蔬菜。每家储存一百斤蔬菜，是容易的，大家都这样作，就可以大大减少商业部门的工作量，使他们把直接经营的那一部分储藏得更好些。
    蔬菜的分配和消费要有计划。在城市和工矿区，可以把蔬菜生产、储存情况向居民说清楚，号召大家计划用菜，细水长流，力求减少旺季消费过多、淡季消费过少的不平衡现象。
    收好、藏好、用好蔬菜，对于安排城乡人民生活，有极重要的作用。我们应该像安排粮食一样地安排蔬菜。只要把大家发动起来，参与这件事情，一定可以像安排好粮食一样地把蔬菜安排好。
