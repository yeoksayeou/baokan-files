    Autumn Harvest on the Tibetan Front
    By Our Correspondents Zong Zidu and Zhao Jialie

    The broad masses of peasants in the Tibet region are currently striving to secure their first bumper harvest since the democratic reforms. In these days, numerous touching stories are emerging from the autumn harvest front, revealing the diligence and joy of Tibetan peasants, who have now become masters of their own destiny, in their free labor.

    Eighty-Year-Old Opens the First Sheaf

    In the golden fields along the Nyang River in southeastern Tibet, an elderly Tibetan woman with white hair cut the first sheaf of abundant highland barley. A pristine white Hada scarf was draped over it, and she presented it with both hands to Zhang Pingfan, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party's Linzhi Sub-District Committee, requesting him to pass it on to our beloved leader, Chairman Mao.

    This eighty-year-old woman, named Zhuoma, said with great emotion, "The Communist Party gave us poor people land, and also led us to organize mutual aid teams and vigorously develop production. This year, we have achieved a historic first bumper harvest. Every grain is a gift from the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."

    When the autumn harvest was about to begin, the peasants of Nichi Village, Linzhi County, selected old woman Zhuoma to be the first to open the harvest and reap the first sheaf of this year's bumper highland barley. The peasants said that old woman Zhuoma is the oldest and suffered the most in the old society. Having her open the harvest symbolizes both liberation and a bumper crop, a double "Tashi Delek" (auspicious and good fortune).

    After old woman Zhuoma opened the harvest, as the peasants cheered and rushed forward waving their sickles, she quickly led the children to follow behind the reaping teams, picking up the scattered ears of wheat. The old woman picked them up carefully, not letting a single ear or grain go to waste. When everyone advised her to go home and rest, she refused, insisting on participating in the autumn harvest with everyone.

    Having endured the oppression and enslavement of feudal lords, the democratic reforms brought new happiness to old woman Zhuoma. The older she gets, the younger she seems to become, and she strives to participate in every aspect of production. She said, "I can only feel at ease if I do my part for our good life." Last winter and this spring, when the entire village launched a manure collection campaign, old woman Zhuoma got up early to sweep the village streets. During sowing, old woman Zhuoma made tea and delivered water; after the crops turned yellow and ripe, she also joined the bird-scaring team to prevent the harvest from being damaged.

    Husband and Wife Compete in Wheat Harvesting

    "Bravo!" A burst of cheers rang out in the wheat field where harvesting was underway. Amidst the cheers, a hard-fought wheat-cutting competition between two people was taking place in the third mutual aid team of Lamu Township, Dazi County, Lhasa area.

    One side was a strong Tibetan peasant, wielding a large sickle. With a continuous "snick, snick, snick" sound, swathes of wheat fell. His opponent was a young Tibetan woman, smaller in stature but quick-eyed and skillful, with nimble movements, making her a formidable reaper.

    They are a husband and wife, the man named Bazhu and the woman named Yangjin. The wheat-cutting competition between the couple arose in this way: at the start of the autumn harvest, a red banner competition centered on fast and clean harvesting was launched among the various mutual aid teams in Lamu Township. The third mutual aid team, to which Bazhu and Yangjin belong, had a weaker workforce and was about to fall behind in the harvest. For the sake of the collective honor of the entire team, everyone strived and competed to be the first in the wheat harvest. Bazhu and Yangjin also began to compete.

    "Help her!" someone shouted. Indeed, Bazhu was reaping faster than Yangjin; however, Yangjin was reaping cleaner than her husband. While harvesting, she also picked off the large, full ears of wheat to save as seeds. The first round of the couple's competition ended in a draw. The team members all encouraged them: "Keep going! Keep going!"

    Old Carpenter Builds a Winnowing Machine

    Old carpenter Dunzhu Cidain walked around a wooden frame that looked like a tall white mule, touching here and tapping there, feeling both excited and nervous. After carefully inspecting the wooden frame, he said to his assistant, "It's ready."

    His assistant, a clever Tibetan lad, immediately grasped the handle of the wooden frame and started to crank it. A gust of wind immediately blew out from the back of the wooden frame. The old carpenter quickly went behind the wooden frame to test the strength of the wind. As soon as he got close, the felt hat on his head was blown off. Bareheaded, the old carpenter shouted excitedly to his assistant, "Ha! We can make wind now. The heavens can no longer hold back the liberated Tibetan peasants!" His voice was full of pride and self-respect.

    In the countryside of Qushui County, along the Yarlung Zangbo River, this kind of wind-making wooden frame is a new tool that has appeared for the first time this autumn harvest. The old carpenter named it "Longke" (meaning wind machine, which is the inland term for windmill). More than ten days ago, when the district party secretary handed the diagram of the "Longke" to the old carpenter, he was immediately attracted to it. He thought: in the past, during the autumn harvest, people had to wait for the heavens to blow wind before they could winnow, sometimes waiting for ten days or half a month, and the highland barley would rot; otherwise, two people would pull a piece of Pulu cloth to fan the wind, which was tiring and the wind was weak, and the highland barley could not be winnowed clean; if people could make wind, how great would that be! During the process of making the "Longke," the old carpenter was simply obsessed. Even when drinking butter tea at noon, he held wooden boards and gestured. To encourage and help him make the "Longke," the district sent him an assistant, and the district party secretary also came to discuss it with him frequently. Once, the old carpenter was using an axe to shave a wooden board, and his hand was cut, bleeding a lot, but the old carpenter didn't notice, because he was thinking about how each fan blade should be installed, and how much the distance between them should be so that the wind force would be great. After five trials and improvements, the first "Longke" was finally made.

    Now, old carpenter Dunzhu Cidain and his assistant have already made the third "Longke," and the peasants call him a "wind-making expert."

    西藏秋收线上
    本报记者　宗子度　赵家烈
    西藏地区的广大农民正在夺取民主改革后第一个秋季大丰收。这些日子，秋收线上每时每刻都涌现出许多动人的事例，从这里可以看出翻身作主的西藏农民，在自由劳动中的勤奋和欢乐。
    八旬老人首开镰
    在西藏东南部尼洋河畔的金色田野里，一位白发苍苍的藏族老妈妈割下了第一束丰硕的青稞，上面搭着一条洁白的哈达，双手献给中共林芝分工委书记张平凡，请他转献给敬爱的领袖毛主席。
    这位年已八十、名叫卓玛的老人激动地说：“共产党给了我们穷苦人土地，又领导我们组织互助组，大搞生产，今年获得了开天辟地的第一次大丰收，每一颗粮食都是共产党和毛主席的恩情。”
    林芝县尼池村农民，在秋收快要开始的时候，就推选了卓玛老妈妈首先开镰，收割今年大丰收的第一束青稞。农民们说，卓玛老妈妈年纪最大，在旧社会受的苦处也最深，由她开镰收割，是翻身加丰收，双重“扎西德勒”（吉祥如意）。
    卓玛老妈妈开镰后，当农民们欢呼着，挥舞着镰刀涌上来的时候，她又连忙领着孩子们跟在割麦队的后边，拣拾散落下来的麦穗。老妈妈拾得很仔细，一穗一粒也不让丢掉。大家劝她回家休息，她横竖不答应，一定要坚持和大家一起进行秋收。
    饱经封建领主压迫奴役的卓玛老妈妈，民主改革给她带来了新的幸福生活。老人越活越年青，生产上事事都要争着插手去做。她说：“为我们的好生活出点力，心里才过得去。”去冬今春，全村开展积肥运动时，卓玛老妈妈清早就起来打扫村巷卫生。播种时，卓玛老妈妈烧茶送水；庄稼黄熟后，她又参加了赶雀队，不让丰收果实受害。
    夫妻竞赛割小麦
    “好呀！”正在收割的小麦地里响起了一片喝采声。在喝采声中，拉萨地区达孜县拉木乡第三互助组的一场两人割麦对手赛正进行得难分难解。
    一方是一位身强力壮的藏族农民，他挥动大镰刀，随着“嚓，嚓，嚓”连声响，一片片小麦倒下来了。他的对手是位青年藏族妇女，个子虽然比他小，然而眼快手巧，动作敏捷，割起麦来也是够瞧的。
    他俩是一对夫妻，男的名叫巴珠，女的名叫央金。夫妻两人的割麦竞赛是这样引起的：秋收一开始，拉木乡各个互助组之间就展开了以收快、收净为中心的红旗竞赛。巴珠和央金所在的第三互助组劳力较弱，收割中眼看就要落后了。为了全组集体的荣誉，组员们在收麦中，人人奋勇，个个争先，巴珠和央金也就竞赛开了。
    “帮帮她吧！”有人在喊。不错，巴珠是比央金割得快；可是，央金却比她的丈夫割得净。她一边收割，一边还把穗大粒饱的麦穗摘下来留作种籽。夫妻俩这天竞赛的第一个回合，打成了平手。组员们一齐鼓动：“再干！再干！”
    老木工造风扬场
    老木匠顿珠次丹绕着一个像一匹高大的白骡子般的木架转来转去，摸摸这，敲敲那，心里又兴奋又紧张。等他把这个木架仔细检查了一遍以后，才对他的助手说：“行啦。”
    他的助手，一个精明的藏族小伙子马上握着木架的摇手柄摇起来，木架后面立刻喷出了一股旋风。老木匠连忙转到木架后面去试试风力的大小，刚一接近，头上的毡帽就给吹跑了。老木匠光着头向他的助手激动地喊叫说：“哈！我们能够造风了，老天爷再也难不住西藏翻身农民了！”声音里充满了自豪和骄傲。
    在雅鲁藏布江边曲水县的农村里，这种造风的木架还是今年秋收中第一次出现的新工具。老木匠给它取名“拢科”（风的机器的意思，也就是内地的风车）。十多天前，当区委书记把“拢科”的图形交给老木匠时，他立刻就被吸引住了。他想：过去秋收中只有等老天爷吹风才能扬场，有时一等十天半月，青稞都给沤烂了；再不然就是两人拉着一块氆氇扇风，人累、风小，青稞也扬不干净；要是人能造风，那该有多好啊！在制造“拢科”的过程中，老木匠简直着了迷，连中午喝酥油茶的时候，也拿着木板比比划划。为了鼓励和帮助他制造“拢科”，区里给派来了一个助手，区委书记也经常来和他研究。有一次，老木匠用斧头削木板，他的手给割了一条口，流了不少血，老木匠还没发觉，原来他在思考每一片风扇应当怎样安装，间隔距离多少，风力才大。经过五次试验改进，第一部“拢科”终于制成了。
    现在，老木匠顿珠次丹和他的助手已经造好了第三部“拢科”，农民们都称他为“造风能手”。
