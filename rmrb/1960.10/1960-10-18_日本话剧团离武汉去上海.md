Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 17th. After performing three shows in Wuhan, the Japanese Theater Troupe left Wuhan for Shanghai on the evening of the 16th.

　　After hearing the unfortunate news in Wuhan that Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, had been murdered by Japanese fascist thugs, members of the Japanese Theater Troupe expressed great indignation. They condemned this despicable conspiracy by the US-Japan reactionaries and expressed their determination to transform grief into strength and continue the struggle against the US-Japan Security Treaty.

　　On the morning of the 13th, all members of the Japanese Theater Troupe held a symposium and get-together with actors from Wuhan's drama, Peking opera, Han opera, and Chu opera circles. During their stay in Wuhan, the guests also visited the Wuhan People's Art Theater and the Wuhan Pioneer People's Commune, and toured the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, and the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company.
