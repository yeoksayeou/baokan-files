Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin. Most cotton processing factories in cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province have started ginning new cotton. By the end of September, over 14.45 million pounds of ginned cotton had been produced, of which more than half had been transported to Shijiazhuang, Beijing, Tianjin, and other places to supply cotton mills.

As early as June, cotton processing factories in various parts of Hebei Province conducted inspections on all cotton gins, cotton seed delinting machines, baling machines, diesel engines, gas engines, and other power machinery. Each region, taking the city as a unit, selected dozens of technicians to form mobile inspection teams to inspect and supervise the progress of repairs at each processing factory and to help solve problems encountered during the repairs. In addition to designating two large factories to manufacture accessories needed for machine repairs in large quantities throughout the province, each region and each county designated a key factory to manufacture them. Cotton processing factories also adopted the method of large factories helping small factories to produce some small parts themselves. Focusing on improving the finished product rate and quality of cotton processing, cotton processing factories throughout the province reinstalled and overhauled most of the machines. More than 70% of cotton processing factories in the province re-aligned and installed all the machines, ensuring normal operation after the start of work. Cotton processing factories with indigenous saw gins focused on overhauling the indigenous saw gins, greatly improving the quality of ginned cotton and reducing the seed fuzz rate. In order to transport the processed ginned cotton to textile factories in a timely manner, cotton processing factories and transportation departments strengthened cooperation. At present, more than 65% of the ginned cotton produced by processing factories throughout the province has been concentrated along the railway line, ready for transport to various places.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. Over the past ten days, twenty-two state-owned cotton processing factories distributed in the suburban counties of Shanghai have successively started work, and more than 16,000 dan of ginned cotton have been delivered to textile factories in batches.

Inside the cotton processing factories, there is a roar of machines. Bales of sun-dried and cleaned seed cotton, just transported from the purchasing stations, are immediately fed into huge cotton suction ducts or placed on conveyor belts and sent directly to the workshops. After being cleaned of impurities by the opener and separated by the cotton gin, clean and soft ginned cotton is discharged from the cotton collecting box at the other end in just one or two minutes. Thanks to vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution, the degree of mechanization and semi-automation of cotton processing factories in Shanghai has been further improved this year, and most factories have established continuous production lines, thus saving more than 1,600 workers to support agricultural production. With the increase in the degree of mechanization, impurities and dead cotton in the cotton are cleaned more thoroughly, making the grade of ginned cotton generally one to two grades higher than that of the original seed cotton.

Grasping early, grasping tightly, and grasping meticulously are the characteristics of this year's cotton processing preparation work. As early as the first quarter of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Second Commercial Bureau began to deploy cotton processing work. Combining the overhaul of existing equipment, various factories actively reformed and manufactured machines and tools, and vigorously solved the problems of high labor intensity and insufficient capacity in cotton conveying, impurity removal, and other processes. Through mutual cooperation and multi-faceted utilization of waste materials, they self-reliantly built more than 40 sets of indigenous machines such as six-roller openers, eighty-piece saw gins, air cotton separators, and blowers, as well as many cotton suction pipes, and converted manual baling machines to electric ones. Relevant material departments in Shanghai also allocated a batch of power equipment and mechanical accessories to support cotton processing.

In order to increase the production of short lint, the Shanghai commercial department regarded increasing cotton seed delinting equipment as an important aspect of processing preparation work. In addition to manufacturing some new-style saw delinting machines themselves, they also converted more than 40 leather roller cotton gins into roller delinting machines, increasing the delinting capacity by 30% compared to last year. Now, each cotton processing factory has nearly ten sets of various types of delinting machinery, and the number of delinting times has increased twice compared to last year. (Attached image)

### 河北上海开工轧制新棉  大批优质皮棉及时送进棉纺厂

    河北上海开工轧制新棉
    大批优质皮棉及时送进棉纺厂
    据新华社天津电　河北省各产棉区大部分棉花加工厂已开工轧制新棉，到9月底，共轧制出一千四百多万斤皮棉；其中半数以上已运往石家庄、北京、天津等地，供给各棉纺厂。
    河北省各地棉花加工厂早在6月间就对全部轧花机、棉籽剥绒机、打包机以及柴油机、煤气机等动力机械作了检查。各地区以市为单位，抽调几十名技术工人组成巡回检查小组，到各加工厂检查检修进度，并且帮助解决检修中的问题。检修机器需要的配件，全省除了指定两个大型工厂大批制造以外，每个地区、每个县都确定一个重点工厂制造，各棉花加工厂还采取大厂帮小厂的办法，自己生产部分小零件。各棉花加工厂围绕提高棉花加工成品率和棉花加工质量，对多数机器进行重新安装和大检修。全省有70％以上的棉花加工厂，把所有的机器重新找正安装，保证了开工后机器运转正常。有土锯齿机的棉花加工厂，着重对土锯齿机进行了大修，大大提高了加工皮棉的质量和降低了棉籽毛头率。为了把加工好的皮棉及时调运给各地纺织工厂，各棉花加工厂和交通运输部门加强了协作。目前，全省各加工厂轧制出的皮棉，65％以上都已集中到铁路沿线，待运各地。
    据新华社上海电　近十多天来，分布在上海郊区各县的二十二个国营棉花加工厂陆续开工，轧好的一万六千多担皮棉已经分批送进纺织工厂。
    在棉花加工厂里，一片机器轰鸣声。一包包晒干、拣净的籽棉，刚刚从收购站运到，马上投进巨大的吸棉风管或是放在输送带上，隆隆地直送车间。经过清花机除杂、轧花机剥离，短短一两分钟，另一端的集棉箱就吐出了洁白松软的皮棉，由于大闹技术革新和技术革命，今年上海棉花加工厂的机械化和半自动化程度进一步提高，绝大部分工厂建立了连续生产线，因此共节约出一千六百多名工人，支援农业生产。随着机械化程度提高，棉花中杂质、僵瓣去得干净，使皮棉品级普遍比原来的籽棉上升一级到二级。
    抓早、抓紧、抓细，是今年棉花加工准备工作的特点。早在今年第一季度，上海市第二商业局就着手部署棉花加工工作。各工厂结合原有设备的检修，积极改革和制造机具，大力解决棉花输送、清除杂质等工序上花劳力多、能力不足的问题。他们通过互相协作，多方利用废旧材料，自力更生地造出了六辊清花机、八十片型锯齿轧花机、风棉分离机、鼓风机等四十多台土机器和许多吸棉管道，又把人力打包机改为电动。上海市有关物资部门也拨出一批动力设备和机械配件，支援棉花加工。
    为了增产短绒，上海商业部门把增加棉籽脱绒设备，作为加工准备工作的一个重要方面，除了自造一部分新式的锯齿脱绒机以外，还把四十多台皮辊轧花机改装成滚刀脱绒机，使脱绒能力比去年提高30％。现在，每个棉花加工厂都有近十台各种类型的脱绒机械，脱绒的次数比去年增加两次。（附图片）
