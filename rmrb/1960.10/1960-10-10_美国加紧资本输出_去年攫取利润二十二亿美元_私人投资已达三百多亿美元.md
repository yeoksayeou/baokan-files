Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 7th: A recent report released by the U.S. Department of Commerce shows that U.S. monopoly capitalists have been intensifying capital exports in recent years, extracting huge profits from the people of other countries.

The U.S. Department of Commerce report states that U.S. commercial companies' investment in foreign branches increased by $2.5 billion in 1959. The current amount of U.S. commercial companies' investment abroad has reached more than $30 billion. In 1959, the U.S. extracted $2.2 billion in profits through this investment.

The Department of Commerce report also said that the increase in U.S. foreign investment in 1959 was greater than in 1958. Of the $2.5 billion increase last year, capital exported from the United States accounted for only $1.4 billion, while reinvested profits extracted locally accounted for $1.1 billion. In the first half of 1960, direct investment was approximately at an annual rate of $1 billion, and the number of reinvested profits was similar.

By region, U.S. companies' investment in Europe increased by nearly $750 million last year. Of the increase in U.S. investment in Europe in 1959 and the first half of 1960, Britain accounted for about 45%. Since 1957, a large portion of U.S. investment in Europe has flowed to West Germany and France, and investment in Italy and the Netherlands has also increased significantly.

Last year, U.S. investment in Canada increased by $830 million. The amount of capital export was roughly the same as in 1958.

At the same time, the United States increased its economic expansion in Latin America and the Middle East. Last year, the U.S. extracted a net profit of $600 million respectively through direct investment in Latin America and the Middle East.

    美国加紧资本输出
    去年攫取利润二十二亿美元
    私人投资已达三百多亿美元
    新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：美国商务部最近发表的报告表明，美国垄断资产阶级近年来加紧资本输出，从别国人民身上榨取了巨额利润。
    美国商务部的报告说，美国商业公司1959年对国外分支公司的投资增加了二十五亿美元。目前美国商业公司在国外的投资额已达三百多亿美元。1959年美国通过这笔投资攫取的利润达二十二亿美元。
    商务部的报告还说，1959年美国国外投资增加的数字比1958年大。在去年增加的二十五亿美元投资中，从美国输出的资本只占十四亿美元，把在当地榨取的利润再投资占十一亿美元。1960年上半年直接投资约为年率十亿美元，利润再投资的数字与此相仿。
    按地区说，美国公司去年对欧洲的投资增加了将近七亿五千万美元。1959年和1960年上半年美国对欧洲投资的增加额中，英国约占45％。1957年以来，美国在欧洲的投资有很大一部分流向西德和法国，在意大利和荷兰的投资也有很大增加。
    去年美国在加拿大的投资增加了八亿三千万美元。资本输出额与1958年数额大致相等。
    同时，美国增加了对拉丁美洲和中东的经济扩张。去年美国通过在拉丁美洲和中东的直接投资分别榨取到六亿美元的纯利润。
