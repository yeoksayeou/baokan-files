Xinhua News Agency, 12th, New York: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the afternoon of the 11th to debate the procedure for discussing the disarmament issue. Disregarding the opposition of socialist countries, the United States manipulated the voting machine to veto the Soviet Union's proposal for the United Nations General Assembly to directly discuss the disarmament issue, and decided to hand the disarmament issue over to the General Assembly's Political Committee for discussion.

　　Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev spoke first at the afternoon meeting. He pointed out that the Soviet delegation firmly believes that it is necessary for the current plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly, attended by the heads of government of many countries, to discuss the issue of complete and thorough disarmament. He added that if, for this or that reason, the disarmament issue cannot be fully discussed and at least some major principles cannot be agreed upon at this session, then the Soviet government considers it necessary to convene an emergency session of the General Assembly to discuss one issue—complete and thorough disarmament.

　　Khrushchev pointed out that most of the heads of state and government attending the General Assembly have returned to their countries, and some other heads of state are also preparing to return. He said that this shows that they do not trust the current session of the General Assembly, nor do they expect the General Assembly to truly study such pressing issues as complete and thorough disarmament.

　　Khrushchev expressed his belief that if the General Assembly plenary meeting seriously raises the disarmament issue, and if it is considered that this issue has particularly urgent significance, then the heads of government and state who have returned to their countries will be able to return to New York. Those heads of state and government who did not participate in the work in the early stage of this session may also come here.

　　Khrushchev said that the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly may be convened in March or April next year. He suggested that the heads of state or government of various countries serve as the heads of the delegations attending the meeting.

　　Khrushchev pointed out again that he hoped that the meeting would be held in Europe, such as Geneva, because most of the countries that have joined the United Nations are geographically close to Europe. Khrushchev said that the meeting could be held in Moscow or Leningrad. He emphasized that if this is the case, the Soviet Union will do everything possible to create the necessary conditions for the normal work of the General Assembly and for all the delegates attending the meeting.

　　Canadian Representative Green spoke after Khrushchev's speech. He followed the United States in opposing the discussion of the disarmament issue at the United Nations General Assembly.

　　US Representative Wadsworth attempted to distort the Soviet Union's intention to have the General Assembly discuss the disarmament issue in his speech. He tried to make people believe that the Soviet Union's proposal was not for disarmament but for "propaganda." He used the "complexity" of the disarmament issue as an excuse to insist that "serious consideration" could only be given in the Political Committee.

　　British Representative Ormsby-Gore repeated the claims of the US and Canadian representatives at the meeting, insisting that it was not appropriate to discuss the disarmament issue at the General Assembly plenary meeting.

　　Czechoslovak Foreign Minister David, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Lukanov, Albanian Representative Shtulla, Hungarian Representative Sik, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Paramarchuk, Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki, Belarusian Representative Mazurov, and Romanian Representative Misinecku spoke successively, unanimously supporting the Soviet proposal and accusing the West of being unwilling to end the arms race and unwilling to break the deadlock in disarmament negotiations.

　　After the Romanian representative spoke, Khrushchev spoke again to respond to the speeches of the Western representatives. He said that the Soviet Union is willing to discuss the disarmament issue anywhere, as long as that place can quickly resolve the issue. However, he pointed out that the experience of the committee's work shows that it is used as a guise to deceive the public.

　　Khrushchev said that he has one last hope that perhaps the General Assembly plenary meeting will help solve the disarmament issue, thereby sparing mankind from the scourge of war. The Soviet head of government emphasized that if the General Assembly decides to discuss the disarmament issue in the Political Committee, then the Soviet Union reserves the right to withdraw from the committee if the committee is used as a guise to deceive the people of all countries.

　　Khrushchev said that if the decision to adopt complete and thorough disarmament is made, then the Soviet Union will accept any measures to supervise disarmament.

　　After the French and American representatives made clumsy attempts to respond to Khrushchev's condemnation of Western governments, the General Assembly voted.

　　Under US pressure, the General Assembly passed the proposal put forward by the General Affairs Committee to hand over the disarmament issue to the Political Committee for discussion by sixty-two votes to twelve, with twenty-four abstentions. Then, the General Assembly rejected the Soviet proposal to discuss the disarmament issue at the General Assembly plenary meeting by thirteen votes to fifty-four, with thirty-one abstentions. The representatives of socialist countries, as well as the representatives of Cuba, Afghanistan, Guinea, and Mali, voted in favor of the Soviet proposal.

    联大全会就讨论裁军问题的程序进行辩论
    社会主义国家代表指责西方不愿裁军
    苏联建议在全会上讨论裁军问题的提案在美国操纵下遭到否决
    据新华社12日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会11日下午举行全体会议，就讨论裁军问题的程序进行辩论。美国不顾社会主义国家的反对，操纵表决机器否决苏联要求由联合国大会直接讨论裁军问题的建议，而决定把裁军问题交给大会政治委员会讨论。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在下午会议上首先发言。他指出，苏联代表团坚决认为有必要由许多国家政府首脑参加的联合国大会本届全体会议来讨论全面彻底裁军问题。他补充说，如果因这个或那个原因而不能充分讨论裁军问题和不能在本届会议上至少就一些主要原则达成协议的话，那末，苏联政府认为有必要召开大会紧急会议讨论一个问题——全面彻底裁军问题。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，参加大会的大多数国家和政府首脑已经回国了，而其他一些国家首脑也准备回国。他说，这就表明，他们不信任大会本届会议，也不期望大会会真正研究全面彻底裁军这样一些迫切的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫表示相信，如果大会全体会议认真地提出裁军问题，如果认为这个问题具有特别紧迫的意义，那末，已经回国的各国政府和国家首脑是能够返回纽约来的。那些在本届会议初期没有参加工作的国家和政府首脑也可能到这里来。
    赫鲁晓夫说，联合国大会紧急会议不妨在明年3、4月间召开。他建议各国的国家或政府首脑担任出席这次会议的代表团的团长。
    赫鲁晓夫再次指出，希望在欧洲，譬如日内瓦召开这次会议，因为大多数加入联合国的国家，在地理上是接近欧洲的。赫鲁晓夫说，可以在莫斯科或列宁格勒举行这次会议。他着重指出，如果这样，苏联将尽一切力量来为大会的正常工作，为所有参加大会的代表创造应有的条件。
    加拿大代表格林在赫鲁晓夫讲话后发言。他追随美国反对在联合国大会上讨论裁军问题。
    美国代表华兹沃斯在发言中妄图歪曲苏联主张由大会来讨论裁军问题的用意，他企图使人相信苏联这种主张不是为了裁军而是为了“宣传”。他借口裁军问题的“复杂”，硬说只有在政治委员会上才能进行“认真的考虑”。
    英国代表奥姆斯比—戈尔在会上重复了美国和加拿大代表的主张，硬说在大会全体会议上讨论裁军问题是不适合的。
    捷克斯洛伐克外交部长戴维、保加利亚外交部长卢卡诺夫、阿尔巴尼亚代表什图拉、匈牙利代表西克、乌克兰外交部长帕拉马尔楚克、波兰外交部长腊帕茨基、白俄罗斯代表马祖罗夫和罗马尼亚代表米辛契斯库先后发言，一致支持苏联的建议，并指责西方不愿意结束军备竞赛、不愿打开裁军谈判僵局。
    罗马尼亚代表发言后，赫鲁晓夫再次发言答复西方代表的发言。他说，苏联愿意在任何地方讨论裁军问题，只要这个地方能够迅速地解决这个问题。但是，他指出，委员会工作的经验表明，它被利用来作为欺骗公众的幌子。
    赫鲁晓夫说，他有一个最后的希望，也许联合国大会全体会议将有助于解决裁军问题，从而使人类免受战争的浩劫。苏联政府首脑着重指出，如果大会决定在政治委员会中讨论裁军问题，那么苏联保留退出委员会的权利，如果委员会被用来作为欺骗各国人民的幌子的话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果采纳全面彻底裁军的决定，那么苏联将接受对裁军实行监督的任何措施。
    在法国代表和美国代表拙劣地企图答辩赫鲁晓夫对西方国家政府的谴责之后，大会进行表决。
    在美国压力下，大会以六十二票对十二票、二十四票弃权通过总务委员会提出的关于把裁军问题交给政治委员会讨论的提案。接着，大会以十三票对五十四票、三十一票弃权否决了苏联建议在大会全体会议上讨论裁军问题的提案。投票赞成苏联提案的是社会主义国家的代表，和古巴、阿富汗、几内亚、马里的代表。
