    Diligently Cultivate the Fields in Autumn, Reap a Bountiful Harvest Next Year
    "Diligently cultivate the fields in autumn, reap a bountiful harvest next year." This is an important lesson that our farmers have summarized in their long-term production practice. Encouraged by the Party's great call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, our farmers are determined to strive for a better harvest next year than in previous years. To achieve a bumper harvest next year, we must focus on two things at the moment: one is to plant autumn crops such as wheat and rapeseed well, laying a good foundation for a summer harvest next year; the other is to plow the fallow fields this winter to create conditions for spring sowing next year. What is the condition of the autumn-plowed land this year? In many areas, especially those severely affected by drought, the planting area of late autumn crops and the area of intercropping and relay cropping have been expanded after the rain. These cultivated lands are harvested later and consume more soil fertility, so they need to be plowed in the autumn to restore fertility. This year, many areas experienced drought followed by floods, and the soil became compacted after the autumn harvest. Autumn plowing should be used to loosen the soil, raise the soil temperature, create favorable conditions for microbial activity, and promote the decomposition and transformation of nutrients. Most parts of North China have experienced drought for two consecutive years, and the soil has insufficient base moisture. According to weather forecasts, some areas may continue to experience spring drought next year. It is even more important to carry out autumn plowing conscientiously to enhance the soil's ability to store water and conserve moisture.
    "Three Autumns" (the period covering late summer and early autumn) has always been the busiest season for agricultural activities throughout the year. This year, many areas have more late autumn crops, and the autumn harvest and autumn plowing are even more tightly packed, making the task even more arduous. Under these circumstances, on the one hand, we must give full play to our subjective initiative and strive to "not leave an acre of stubble land over the winter." On the other hand, in some areas, if after careful investigation and calculation, it is proven that it is indeed impossible to plow all the land, we should make a decisive decision, distinguish between the importance and urgency, plow the land that must be plowed in the autumn first, and resolutely postpone the land that can be plowed in the spring of next year. The most important thing here is to conduct thorough investigations, careful calculations, comprehensive planning, and early arrangements. When the autumn harvest began, Qinyuan County in Shanxi Province mobilized the vast number of commune members to discuss autumn plowing work, and the production teams, management areas, and communes calculated the three accounts of land, livestock power, and time for autumn plowing from the bottom up, level by level. The county needs to plow 340,000 mu of land in the autumn, and has more than 10,300 head of draft animals. Excluding the amount of land that can be cultivated by three standard platform tractors, each animal bears an average burden of cultivating 65 mu of land, and the plowing time is only one month. The task is very arduous. All communes, management areas, and production teams in the county have conducted land ranking, determined the order of plowing each piece of land and the quality standards to be achieved based on the different soil qualities of mountain and plain land, the size and distance of the plots, and the shady and sunny conditions of the land. According to these requirements, labor and animal power are rationally arranged, and most of the strength is concentrated on the autumn harvest, while more than 5,380 skilled plowers and more than 5,000 head of draft animals are drawn to rush to autumn plowing, implementing the "six-determination contract responsibility system" of fixed personnel and animals, fixed tasks, fixed time, fixed quality, fixed plots, and fixed work points. In this way, it is possible to ensure that both the autumn harvest and autumn plowing are not delayed. First, all the land that urgently needs to be plowed this year should be plowed, and some can be left to be plowed in the spring of next year, so that the limited strength can be used where it is most needed.
    Draft animals are the basic driving force in the current autumn plowing, but in many areas, animal power is not sufficient. Whether the autumn plowing task can be completed mainly depends on whether the use of draft animals is appropriate. According to the experience of various places, there are three ways to use draft animals reasonably: First, scientifically arrange agricultural work and spare some draft animals for autumn plowing. Liangjia Commune's Donggu Management Area in Shulan County, Jilin Province, adopted the method of matching strong animals with weak animals, which not only ensured the autumn harvest, but also added 41 strong animals to the autumn plowing front, greatly accelerating the progress of autumn plowing. Second, concentrate forces to ensure key areas, tap the potential of non-agricultural sectors within the commune and team, and transfer all available large livestock to participate in autumn plowing. All communes and production teams in Mentougou District, Beijing, temporarily transferred the large livestock that were originally engaged in industry, sideline production, and transportation to participate in autumn plowing. The animal power on the autumn plowing front increased sharply by more than one-third. It is estimated that the district will complete the general plowing task by the end of October. Third, organize collaboration and mutual support. The autumn plowing tasks of each production team vary in size, the autumn harvest is sometimes early and sometimes late, and the number of draft animals varies. Short-term collaboration and support should be implemented under the principle of mutual consultation and exchange at equal value. In order to help production teams with large autumn plowing tasks complete the plowing task in a timely manner, Wanfu Commune in Chengwu County, Shandong Province, organized the collaboration and support of manpower and animal power of all production teams in the commune under the strict principle of equal value exchange, so that the daily progress of plowing in the commune increased from 1,200 mu to 2,750 mu. Some production teams that were originally unable to complete the autumn plowing task will now be able to complete the task.
    Autumn plowing is the last battle on the agricultural front this year and the first battle on the agricultural front next year. Let us show greater revolutionary vigor and resolutely fight this battle well!

### 三秋勤耕田，丰收在来年

    三秋勤耕田，丰收在来年
    “三秋勤耕田，丰收在来年。”这是我国农民在长期生产实践中总结出来的一条重要经验。我国农民在党的大办农业、大办粮食的伟大号召的鼓舞之下，立志争取在明年获得比往年更好的收成。为了取得明年丰收，眼下要抓紧两件事情：一件是把小麦、油菜等秋种作物种好，为明年的夏季丰收打好基础；一件是把今年冬季的休闲田翻耕好，为明年的春季播种创造条件。今年秋耕地的状况怎么样呢？许多地区，特别是干旱严重的地区，在得雨以后，扩大了很多晚秋作物的播种面积和间种、套种的面积。这些耕地收获较晚，地力消耗较大，需要在秋季加以耕翻，恢复地力。今年许多地区先旱后涝，秋收以后土壤板结，应该通过秋耕疏松土壤，提高地温，给微生物的活动创造有利条件，促进养分的分解和转化。华北大部地区连续两年干旱，土壤底墒不足，据气象预报，有些地区明年还有继续发生春旱的可能，更要认真进行秋耕，增强土壤的蓄水保墒能力。
    “三秋”历来是一年当中农事最为繁忙的季节，今年许多地区晚秋作物多，秋收、秋耕挤的更紧，任务越加繁重。在这种情况下，一方面，要充分发挥主观能动性，力争“不留一亩板茬过冬”。另一方面，有些地区，如果经过认真的调查、计算，证明确实不能全部翻耕，也应该当机立断，分别轻重缓急，把必须秋耕的先耕了，把可以推到明年春季翻耕的坚决推迟。这里最重要的是周密调查，仔细计算，全面规划，早作安排。山西沁源县在秋收开始时，就发动广大社员，讨论秋耕工作，以生产队、管理区、公社为单位，由下而上，逐级计算秋耕的土地、畜力、时间三笔细账。全县需要秋耕的土地有三十四万亩，耕畜一万零三百多头，除去三个标准台拖拉机可能耕地的数量，平均每犋耕畜负担耕地六十五亩，而耕地时间只有一个月，任务是很繁重的。这个县各个公社、管理区、生产队都进行了土地排队，根据山地、川地的不同土质，地块的大小和远近，土地背阴、向阳等情况，确定耕翻每块土地的次序和要求达到的质量标准。根据这些要求，合理安排劳力畜力，集中大部力量突击秋收，同时抽出五千三百八十多名耕地能手和五千多犋耕畜突击秋耕，实行定人畜、定任务、定时间、定质量、定地块、定工分的“六定包干负责制”，这样，秋收、秋耕两不误，是可能作到的。首先把今年急要耕翻的土地全部耕完，有一部分可留待明春耕翻，这样就能把有限的力量使用在最需要的地方。
    耕畜是当前秋耕中的基本动力，而许多地区的畜力是不充裕的。能否完成秋耕任务，主要决定于耕畜的使用是否得当。根据各地的经验，合理使用耕畜，有下面三种办法：一是科学地安排农活，匀出一些耕畜进行秋耕。吉林舒兰县亮甲公社东孤管理区，采取壮畜搭配弱畜的办法，既保证了秋收，又给秋耕战线增加了四十一头壮畜，大大加快了秋耕进度。二是集中力量，保证重点，从社、队内部的非农业部门挖掘潜力，抽调一切可用的大牲畜参加秋耕。北京门头沟区各个公社和生产队，把原来搞工业、副业、运输的大牲口，暂时抽调出来参加秋耕，秋耕战线的畜力激增三分之一以上，估计全区10月底即可完成普耕任务。三是组织协作和互相支援。各生产队的秋耕任务有大有小，秋收有迟有早，耕畜有多有少，应在互相协商、等价交换的原则下，实行短期协作和支援。山东成武县万福公社为了帮助秋耕任务很大的生产队及时完成耕翻任务，在严格等价交换的原则下，组织全社各生产队的人力、畜力的协作支援，使全社耕地日进度由一千二百亩增加到二千七百五十亩。一些原来完不成秋耕任务的生产队，这样一来就能完成任务了。
    秋耕，是今年农业战线上的最后一仗，是明年农业战线上的最初一仗，让我们拿出更大的革命干劲，坚决打好这一仗！
