Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, October 5th: The twenty-fifth plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Venezuela, currently in session, passed a resolution supporting the Havana Declaration adopted by the Cuban people at the National People's Assembly on September 2nd. The resolution stated, "The Havana Declaration is a powerful ideological weapon in the hands of the Latin American people in their struggle to regain their rights, to achieve complete liberation, and for fraternal international solidarity in revolution."

The resolution of the meeting pointed out that "the Latin American peoples' desire for liberation is perfectly embodied" in the Havana Declaration. "The Havana Declaration represents the indignation of the Latin American peoples at the 'Declaration of San José,' which was dictated by U.S. imperialism and accepted by those governments that have betrayed the ideals of independence, sovereignty, and continental unity."

After citing the contents of the Havana Declaration, the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Venezuela emphasized that "this is the contribution of the heroic Cuban people to the struggles of their brother peoples on the continent, and the Latin American peoples should support this declaration with the utmost enthusiasm and all their strength."

Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, October 5th: Venezuelan painters and political figures have telegraphed Mexican President Adolfo López Mateos, requesting the release of the imprisoned General Secretary of the Mexican Communist Party and renowned muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros.

Signatories to the telegram included prominent painters from various schools of Venezuelan painting, including Mateo Manaure, Alejandro Otero, and Gabriel Bracho. Also signing the telegram were parliamentarians Eduardo Machado, Pompeyo Márquez, Jorge Dáher, and others. The Venezuelan Journalists Association and other professional organizations have also telegraphed their support for Siqueiros.
