    Five Days and Nights on Flying Tiger Mountain
    Colonel Fan Tian'en
    On the occasion of commemorating the great tenth anniversary of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the volunteer soldiers who participated in the anti-aggression struggle in Korea all have some unusual memories, especially regarding "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers," "the decisive factor of war is people, not things," and the combat friendship forged with blood by the people of the two countries. Chairman Mao's brilliant assertions and the lofty friendship between the Chinese and Korean people have transformed so many hardships into victories! The five days and nights on Flying Tiger Mountain is one such example.
    In early October 1950, after the U.S. imperialists and the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit army suffered a heavy blow from the Chinese People's Volunteers in Yunshan, they quickly retreated to the south bank of the Qingchuan River and, in the Gunli and Decheon line, gathered six divisions, vainly attempting to advance again towards the Sino-Korean border. At that time, Flying Tiger Mountain, north of Gunli, became a place of contention between the enemy and us. At that time, I was working in a certain regiment and gloriously accepted the combat mission of capturing Flying Tiger Mountain, holding Flying Tiger Mountain, and buying time for the brother units to attack. With the support of the Korean people, our regiment fought fiercely with the entire puppet 7th Division and part of the U.S. army for five days and nights, repelling the enemy's attacks of 100 or more people 57 times and conducting nine rounds of repeated battles for the position, without losing an inch of ground.
    On the night of November 3rd, it was drizzling. I was in the regimental command post explaining the mission to the battalion commanders:
    "This highway in Gunli leads directly to Heechon, Ganggye, and Manpo. Manpo is on the bank of the Yalu River, across from our motherland, which is also the route the enemy vainly attempts to invade northward." Everyone was concentrating on marking the military map. I continued:
    "There is a regiment of enemies on Flying Tiger Mountain. Our mission is to take Flying Tiger Mountain, hold Flying Tiger Mountain, and hold back the enemy, buy time, so that the brother units can make full preparations and weave a large net of annihilation for the enemy." I explained the entire deployment, and then Political Commissar Zhao Xiaoyun added:
    "We are going to fight the enemy with aircraft and artillery with short-range weapons. Although the task is arduous, I believe that every one of our soldiers knows for whom they are fighting, and we have the support of the Chinese and Korean people behind us. With these, we can defeat the enemy..."
    At dawn on the 4th, the light rain continued, and Flying Tiger Mountain, which was more than 600 meters high, was completely submerged in the rain and fog. The 2nd Battalion, which was assigned to be the main attack, began to move forward.
    The attack began at five o'clock in the morning. In less than two hours, the 2nd Battalion occupied the main position of Flying Tiger Mountain. A regiment of enemies retreated without daring to counterattack. The soldiers said angrily, "Climbing such a big mountain, we only killed a hundred or so enemies. It's really not worth it." Deputy Battalion Commander Chen Duanwen stood on Flying Tiger Mountain, looked around Gunli, and said, "What's the rush? Quickly strengthen the fortifications. This is only the beginning of the battle."
    As soon as the troops occupied the position, the phones in the regimental command post were ringing non-stop. Each battalion was competing to be the main attacker, and the reasons were the same: they couldn't let the enemy achieve its goal of invading northward; they wanted to avenge the dead Korean elders; they didn't want Korean children to lose their parents... Who should I approve? According to the situation at the time, I replied: "Each company should attack according to the needs of the situation." Before I could put the phone down, the warriors of the Second Platoon of the Fourth Company rushed through the dense grass to the enemy. On the land plowed by artillery fire, they repelled two enemy attacks. Just as the fighting was in full swing, a group of enemies came up from behind. The platoon leader immediately ordered the shooter Wu Jingwen to eliminate this enemy force. At that time, an enemy three times our size finally rushed up. After the second platoon threw grenades, they waved their guns and charged into the enemy ranks. After a burst of fighting, the enemy was driven back again.
    The position of the Fifth Company was at the southern end of Flying Tiger Mountain, and the Third Platoon was guarding the forefront of the position. Although they hadn't eaten for two days and had gone through a day of fierce fighting, the soldiers were still vigilantly monitoring the enemy.
    As soon as it dawned on the 5th, dozens of enemy planes bombed their position close to the treetops, and dozens of artillery pieces also began a fierce bombardment. The enemies who couldn't attack our position, relying on the advantage of artillery fire, almost destroyed the soldiers' fortifications. The Third Platoon endured the test of more than 2,000 shells in one day on a 200-meter-long position, repelling seven enemy attacks in a row.
    What force made our soldiers so tenacious? Weapons and equipment? No. The battle of Flying Tiger Mountain was a battle where the enemy's and our equipment strength was extremely unfair. Let Liang Renjiang, a machine gun shooter from the Fifth Company, answer this question:
    "We can defeat the American devils with just an iron rod (rifle), a few hammers (grenades), plus an eleventh car (two legs). Because every shot we fire, every step we take, or every drop of blood we shed on the position, we know how much significance it has."
    In the midst of the fierce fighting all day, the comrades also had to fight against cold, hunger, and fatigue. The soldiers were shivering in the night wind wearing thin clothes. They hadn't had a drop of water or rice for several days, and the corners of their mouths were cracked and bleeding. Some soldiers were so hungry that they had to tighten their waist belts again and again. Lao Liang, a machine gun shooter from the Fifth Company, had a dry and painful throat from the smoke and longed for a cool drink of water, but there wasn't even snow on the land plowed by artillery fire. So, he picked a wide leaf and licked the dew on it; he was so hungry, but there was nothing to eat in his dry food bag, so he picked up a round, shiny stone and rolled it around in his mouth.
    "What are you eating?" Li Jinglong asked.
    "It's a stone."
    "Can you eat a stone?"
    "No, I'm too hungry! Holding it makes more saliva and helps a bit."
    Suddenly, the soldiers all had stones in their mouths, and they seemed to be chewing very deliciously.
    The battle continued fiercely. The masses of coal mines and aluminum mines living under Flying Tiger Mountain did not leave us for a step. During these most difficult days, the local Labor Party Committee and the Communist Youth League brought us some food. The masses cooked the food for us in the open fields where enemy planes were circling, and men and women carried pots and jars up the mountain to deliver food to us.
    Shells exploded, bullets whizzed, and the fiery position was completely filled with smoke. The women delivering food carried their children on their backs and pots of food on their heads, sometimes lying down in shell craters and sometimes walking through the fire net of bullets towards the main peak position.
    The soldiers of the Fifth Company, who had just repelled fifteen enemy assaults, looked back and saw a group of Korean residents coming up the north slope, bringing cooked corn, wheat, rice, etc. to the position. The soldiers held the hands of the Korean people tightly, so excited that they couldn't say a word.
    The local secretary of the Labor Party said: "Comrades, eat! This is the food that the masses hid when the enemy invaded northward. The masses asked us to bring their hearts to you and also place their hope for victory on you..."
    Although the soldiers hadn't eaten for several days, they felt full at this time, and a kind of lofty and precious combat friendship filled the soldiers' hearts. They gripped their guns even tighter. Our soldiers didn't have more ornate words, and almost said the same sentence at the same time: "Don't worry, folks, we will hold the position as long as we live!"
    By the evening of the 7th, the position was practically out of ammunition and food. Each battalion was requesting instructions from me on the phone: even if there was only one bullet, they hoped I could find some way.
    After four days of continuous fighting, we were far away from the rear and could not get supplies, and the enemy had transferred another regiment, which meant that tomorrow (8th) the enemy would attack us in turn with three regiments.
    "Please tell the soldiers that there are no bullets, but the position must still be held, that is, with bayonets, gun butts, and stones!"
    The soldiers understood the situation, knew the leadership's determination, and knew the great significance of holding Flying Tiger Mountain for the entire battle situation. So that night, they all jumped out of the fortifications to sharpen their bayonets, move stones, and check the guns of their fallen comrades to see if any bullets were left...
    As soon as it dawned on the 8th, a fierce battle indeed began.
    More than eighty enemy planes and hundreds of artillery pieces poured thousands of shells onto the Flying Tiger Mountain position. Flying Tiger Mountain was engulfed in a mountain fire and plunged into rolling smoke.
    The soldiers in the smoke and fire lay motionless on the ground, waiting for groups of enemies to come to the front of the fortifications. The soldiers jumped out of the fortifications, stones flew, gun butts waved, and bayonets chopped down one after another. The soldiers of the Eighth Company used a sixty-mm mortar shell as a grenade. With a bang, the enemies were blown into the sky along with the "Stars and Stripes" and "Taegeukgi"... This day lasted from sunrise to sunset, and no one could remember how many enemy attacks were repelled. They only knew that the position was still ours, and they only knew that the enemy paid the price of more than 2,500 casualties...
    Ten years have passed since the five days and nights on Flying Tiger Mountain, but the combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean people in fighting against the enemy and supporting each other is still alive!

    飞虎山上五昼夜
    上校　范天恩
    在纪念伟大的抗美援朝战争十
  周年的时候，曾在朝鲜参加过反侵略斗争的志愿军战士，都会有些不寻常的回忆，特别是对“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”，对“战争的决定的因素是人不是物”，和两国人民用鲜血结成的战斗友谊，都有深刻的体会，毛主席的这些英明论断和中、朝人民的崇高友谊，曾使多少艰难困苦转化为胜利啊！飞虎山五昼夜就是其中的一个例子。
    1950年10月初，美帝国主义和李承晚匪军在云山遭受了中国人民志愿军沉重打击之后，便迅速龟缩到清川江南岸，并在军隅里、德川一线，纠集六师之众，妄图重向中朝边境进犯，而军隅里北面的飞虎山，当时便成了敌我必争之地。那时我在某团工作，光荣地接受了攻下飞虎山，守住飞虎山，为兄弟部队争取攻击时间的战斗任务。我团在朝鲜人民的支援下，与伪七师全部和一部分美军鏖战五昼夜，击溃敌百人以上的攻击五十七次、进行九次阵地反复争夺，而寸土未失。
    11月3日夜，细雨蒙蒙，我在团指挥所里向各营长交代任务：
    “军隅里这条公路一直通往熙川、江界、满浦。满浦就在鸭绿江岸，对面就是我们的祖国，也就是敌人妄想北犯的路线。”所有的人都在聚精会神地往军用地图上划标记。我接着说：
    “飞虎山上有敌人一个团，我们的任务就是拿下飞虎山，守住飞虎山，拖住敌人，争取时间，让兄弟部队作充分准备，给敌人织个聚歼的大网。”我把整个部署讲了一遍，然后赵霄云政委补充说：
    “我们要用短兵火器去与具有飞机大炮的敌人作战，虽然任务艰巨，但我相信；我们每个战士都知道为谁作战，我们后边有着中朝人民的支援。凭这些就可以打败敌人……。”
    4日拂晓，小雨仍继续下着，高达六百多米的飞虎山全淹没在雨雾之中。担任主攻的二营，开始往前运动了。
    清晨五点钟开始攻击，没用两个钟头，二营就占领了飞虎山主要阵地，敌人一个团没敢反击就溃退了。战士们都气愤地说：“爬了这么个大山，才揍死百十多敌人，真不合算。”副营长陈端文站在飞虎山上环视了一下军隅里说：“急啥？赶快加修工事，这仅仅是战斗的开始。”
    部队一占领阵地，团指挥所的电话就应接不暇了。各营都争着担任主攻，理由都是共同的；不能让敌人达到北犯的目的；要替死去的朝鲜父老报仇；让朝鲜孩子不再失去父母……；我究竟批准谁呢？根据当时情况，我回答说：“各连视情况需要相机出击。”还没等我把电话放下，四连二排的勇士便穿过浓密的草丛冲到敌人跟前了。在炮火犁过的土地上，打退敌人两次攻击。正打得热火的时候，一部分敌人从后面上来了。排长立即命令射手吴景文消灭这股敌人。当时，三倍于我的敌人终于冲上来了。二排打完手榴弹，就挥着枪冲入敌群，一阵厮杀之后，敌人又被打退了。
    五连的阵地在飞虎山南端，三排据守在阵地最前沿，虽然他们已经两天没吃饭了，又经过一天的激战，战士们仍然警惕地监视着敌人。
    5日天刚亮，敌人几十架飞机便贴着树梢在他们阵地上轰炸，几十门大炮也开始了猛烈轰击。攻不动我们阵地的敌人，仰仗着炮火的优势，把战士的工事几乎都打坍了，三排在二百米长的阵地上，一天接受了两千多发炮弹的考验，一连打退敌人七次攻击。
    什么力量使着我们的战士如此顽强呢？武器装备吗？不。飞虎山战斗是一场敌我装备力量极不公平的战斗。还是让五连机枪射手梁仁江回答这问题吧：
    “我们就凭一条铁棍（步枪），几个锤子（手榴弹），再加上十一号小汽车（两条腿），就能打败美国鬼子。因为我们每放一枪，每走一步，或是洒在阵地上一滴血，都知道它有多大意义。”
    终日的激战，同志们还要和冷、饿、累作斗争。战士们穿着单薄的衣服在夜风里打着抖，几天来水米未沾口，嘴角干裂直冒血。有的战士饿着肚子，只好把腰皮带紧了又紧。五连机枪射手老梁被硝烟呛的嗓子干疼，多么想饱喝一顿凉水啊，可是被炮火犁过的土地上连雪也没有。于是，他拣了一张宽大的树叶，?着上面的露水；饿的难受，但干粮袋里连一点吃的也没有了，于是他又拣起一块又圆又亮的石头，放在嘴里“咕噜咕噜”地转来转去。
    “你吃什么？”李景龙问。
    “是石头。”
    “石头能吃吗？”
    “不，太饿了！含着它口水多些管点事。”
    顿时，战士们嘴里都含块石头，看来嚼得很香呢。
    战斗仍在激烈地继续着。飞虎山下居住的煤矿和铝矿的群众并没有离开我们一步。就在这最艰苦的日子里，当地劳动党里委员会、民青同盟为我们送来了一些粮食。群众就在敌机盘旋的旷野里给我们把饭做熟，男男女女顶着盆罐上山给我们送饭来了。
    炮弹爆炸，子弹呼啸，火海一样的阵地被硝烟全部弥漫。送饭的妇女们背着孩子，顶着饭盆，一会卧倒在弹坑里，一会又穿过枪弹的火网往主峰阵地走来。
    刚打退敌人十五次冲锋的五连战士回头一瞧：北山坡上来了一群朝鲜居民，把煮熟的苞米、麦子、大米等送到阵地上来了。战士们紧握朝鲜人民的手，激动得说不出一句话。
    当地劳动党的书记同志说：“同志们吃吧！这是敌人北犯时群众藏起来的粮食，群众让我们把心意带给你们，也把胜利的希望寄托在你们身上……”。
    战士们虽然几天没吃饭，可是这时却像吃得很饱，一种崇高的、珍贵的战斗友谊填满了战士心胸。他们把枪握得更紧了。我们的战士没有更多华丽的词藻，几乎同时说出一句话：“放心吧，老乡，人在阵地在！”
      7日傍晚，阵地上可说是弹尽粮绝了。各营都在电话里向我请示：哪怕有一颗子弹也好，希望我想些办法。
    四天的连续战斗，我们远离后方，得不到补充，而且敌人又调来了一个团，也就是说：明天（8日）敌人要用三个团轮番向我们攻击了。
    “请你们转告战士，子弹没有，但是阵地还要守住，那就是用刺刀、用枪托、用石头！”
    战士们了解了情况，知道领导的决心，知道守住飞虎山对全部战局的重大意义，于是当晚都跳出工事磨刺刀、搬石头，检查自己伤亡同志的枪，看看是否留下子弹……。
    8日天刚亮，一场恶战果然开始了。
    敌人八十多架飞机和数百门大炮，一齐把数以千计的炮弹倾注在飞虎山阵地上，飞虎山上卷起漫山大火，没入滚滚硝烟之中。
    烟火之中的战士们，伏在地上一动不动，等成群的敌人来到工事之前，战士跃出工事，石头纷飞，枪托挥舞，刺刀劈完一个又一个。八连战士用一发六○炮弹当了手榴弹，轰隆一声，敌人随着“星条旗”、“八卦旗”一块炸上了天……。这一天从日出打到日落，谁也记不清打退敌人多少次攻击，只知道阵地还是我们的，只知道敌人付出两千五百多个伤亡的代价……。
    飞虎山五昼夜过去十年了，可是中朝人民对敌斗争，互相支持的战斗友谊却依然长在！
