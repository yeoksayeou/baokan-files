Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 15th: The new type of socialist competition initiated by the Korean working class – the "Chollima Workteam" movement – has recently been rapidly expanding and developing in various sectors of the national economy. According to today's "Rodong Sinmun" report, by the end of September, 13,487 workteams in North Korea, totaling more than 274,000 workers, had participated in this movement.

Since the "Chollima Workteam" Movement Advanced Workers Conference was held in August this year, this movement has gained broader mass participation. It has rapidly unfolded not only in the industrial sector but also in agriculture, commerce, education, healthcare, science, culture, and the arts. In September alone, more than 2,600 workteams and collectives, totaling more than 46,000 workers, staff, and cadres, newly joined the movement. In many factories, such as the Namsan Steelworks, this movement has developed into a movement to establish "Chollima Workshops."

The advanced collectives that have won the glorious title of "Chollima Workteam" are actively responding to the call of the Workers' Party of Korea, acting as pioneers in the technical innovation movement. Members of the Chollima Youth Workteam led by labor hero Zhu Chengyi of the Ryongsong Machinery Factory, together with technical innovation activists in the machining workshop, displayed the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and manufactured Korea's first 3,000-ton hydraulic press.

The "Chollima Workteam" not only leads the way in all aspects of production but also vigorously promotes the communist spirit, striving to help backward units and individuals. Chen Yingyuan, the leader of the Chollima Workteam at the Namsan Steelworks, which first initiated the "Chollima Workteam" movement, recently took the initiative to request to become the leader of the largest shift at Furnace No. 5, which was the most backward in production and frequently failed to meet its targets. After arriving at Furnace No. 5, he worked hard to carry out ideological work, eliminating the disunity among workers and the lack of enthusiasm for production that had existed in the past, making Furnace No. 5 leap to become the furnace with the best production task completion in the entire factory.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: The labor emulation movement of the broad masses of workers and staff in factories and mines in North Vietnam, which is developing vigorously, is constantly bringing good news of victory and has already achieved significant success in promoting current industrial production.

Up to now, 38 factories, mines, enterprises, geological exploration teams, and other units under the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Ministry of Light Industry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have completed this year's plan and the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) ahead of schedule. Among them, the Eighth Exploration Team of Thai Nguyen Province, the Sixth Exploration Team of Cho Don, and the Fifth Exploration Team of Lang Hich have completed the tasks stipulated in the Three-Year Plan 114 to 159 days ahead of schedule, respectively.

The Third National Congress of the Vietnamese Labor Party, as well as the extensive and in-depth publicity and mobilization work carried out after the meeting, greatly stimulated the labor enthusiasm and the spirit of diligence and thrift in building socialism among the broad masses of workers and staff in North Vietnam, bringing the labor emulation movement of the workers and staff to a climax.

In order to make the competition movement more widespread and in-depth, in addition to paying attention to strengthening political and ideological education and encouraging the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff to improve production efficiency, the leading departments at all levels in North Vietnam particularly emphasized mobilizing the masses to further promote the movement of rationalizing production and technical innovation. In late September, the Prime Minister's Office specially convened a meeting to listen to work reports, exchange pilot experiences, and study and improve economic and technical indicators and technical standards. The Cao Bang Tin Mine, which had completed the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule, had opened 52 technical and business learning classes, with 2,000 technical cadres and technical workers, who studied while combining with practical work, promoted the technical innovation of the entire mine. The mining department of this mine launched the "Thousand Cars" per day movement, increasing production from the original 600 to 700 cars per day to more than 1,300 cars, creating an unprecedented record of high production.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest: The broad masses of workers and staff in Hungary are enthusiastically carrying out labor emulation, striving to overfulfill this year's annual plan and prepare for the upcoming Second Five-Year Plan (1961-1965).

The workers and staff of the Lenin Iron and Steel United Enterprise have widely participated in the "Socialist Labor Team" competition movement. By September, a total of 460 labor teams (a total of 4,294 workers and staff) throughout the factory had participated in this competition, of which 133 labor teams had won the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team."

These collectives that have won this glorious title have made outstanding achievements in all aspects, especially in production. For example, the "Margoczi Labor Team" of the open-hearth furnace workshop has increased steel production by an average of one ton per hour more than the original plan in the past year. The "Breidenbach Labor Team" of the iron smelting plant produces an average of 14 kilograms more castings per hour than other labor teams. The "Mikulas Labor Team" of the steel forging workshop has completed 14% more production tasks than originally planned since the beginning of this year; they have not produced any defective products in the past year.

The workers and staff in the precision instrument industry have already achieved the guarantee of increasing the value of instruments by 72 million forints (Hungarian currency) for the whole year, which they put forward at the beginning of the year. Now, they have proposed to increase the value of products by another 32 million forints in the second half of the year.

The "Socialist Labor Team" competition in the food industry is also developing rapidly. At present, 583 labor teams have participated in this competition, of which 200 teams have obtained the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team."

    进一步发挥劳动积极性　促进生产不断高涨
    朝越匈职工广泛展开劳动竞赛
    据新华社平壤15日电　朝鲜工人阶级发起的新型的社会主义竞赛——“千里马作业班”运动，最近在国民经济的各个部门中迅速扩大和发展。据“劳动者新闻”今天报道，到9月底为止，朝鲜北部已有一万三千四百八十七个作业班，共二十七万四千多名劳动者参加了这一运动。
    自从今年8月举行“千里马作业班”运动先进工作者大会以来，这一运动具有了更广泛的群众性。它不仅在工业部门，而且也在农业、商业、教育、保健、科学、文化艺术等部门中迅速展开。仅在9月份，就有两千六百多个作业班和集体、共四万六千多名工人、职员和干部新参加了这一运动。在降仙炼钢厂等许多工厂中，这一运动已经发展为建立“千里马车间”的运动。
    荣获“千里马作业班”光荣称号的先进集体，积极响应朝鲜劳动党的号召，充当了技术革新运动的先锋。龙城机械厂劳动英雄朱成一领导的千里马青年作业班的成员们，同加工车间的技术革新积极分子们一起发扬敢想、敢干的精神，制成了朝鲜历史上第一台三千吨的水压机。
    “千里马作业班”不仅在生产各方面走在前列，而且大力发扬共产主义精神，努力帮助后进的单位和个人。首先发起“千里马作业班”运动的降仙炼钢厂千里马作业班班长陈应源，不久前主动地要求到生产最落后、经常不能完成计划的五号炉去当大班的班长。他到五号炉后努力进行思想工作，消除了过去工人之间不团结、有的人不安心生产的现象，使五号炉一跃而为全厂生产任务完成得最好的炉。
    据新华社河内电　正在蓬勃发展中的越南北方厂矿广大职工的劳动竞赛运动，不断传来胜利喜讯，在推进当前工业生产上已经取得显著成就。
    到目前为止，越南民主共和国重工业部和轻工业部所属的三十八个厂矿企业、地质勘探队等单位，已经提前完成了今年计划和三年计划（1958—1960年）。其中，太原省第八勘探队、佐同第六勘探队、廊希第五勘探队等已分别提前一百一十四天到一百五十九天完成了三年计划所规定的任务。
    越南劳动党第三次全国代表大会以及会后所进行的广泛而深入的宣传动员工作，大大激发了越南北方广大职工的劳动热情和勤俭建设社会主义的斗志，使职工们的劳动竞赛运动进入了高潮。
    为使竞赛运动更普遍深入地开展，越南北部各级领导部门除注意加强政治思想教育，鼓励广大职工的劳动热情，以提高生产效率外，特别强调发动群众进一步推动生产合理化运动和技术革新运动，9月下旬，总理府曾专门召集会议，听取工作情况汇报，交流试点经验，研究改进经济技术指标和技术标准。已提前完成三年计划的高平锡矿曾开办五十二个技术和业务学习班，有二千技术干部和技术工人，一面学习，一面结合实际工作，推动了全矿的技术革新。这个矿的开采部门开展了日产“千车”运动，由原来日产六、七百车，提高到一千三百多车，创造了空前高产的纪录。
    据新华社布达佩斯电　匈牙利广大的职工正在热烈开展劳动竞赛，争取超额完成今年的年度计划，为即将开始的第二个五年计划（1961—1965年）作好准备。
    列宁钢铁联合企业的职工广泛参加了“社会主义劳动队”的竞赛运动。到9月为止，全厂共有四百六十个劳动队（共四千二百九十四名职工）参加了这一竞赛，其中已有一百三十三个劳动队获得了“社会主义劳动队”的光荣称号。
    这些荣获这一光荣称号的集体在各方面，首先是在生产方面做出了出色的成绩。例如平炉车间的“马尔戈齐劳动队”一年来平均每小时比原订计划增产一吨钢。炼铁厂的“布雷伊登巴赫劳动队”每小时平均比其他劳动队多生产十四公斤的铸件。锻钢车间的“米古拉什劳动队”今年以来所完成的生产任务比原订计划高14％；他们一年来没有出过废品。
    精密仪器工业部门的职工已经提前实现了他们在年初提出的全年增产价值七千二百万福林（匈币）的仪器的保证。现在，他们又提出在下半年内再增产价值三千二百万福林的产品。
    食品工业部门的“社会主义劳动队”竞赛也日益发展。目前已有五百八十三个劳动队参加了这一竞赛，其中二百个队已取得了“社会主义劳动队”的光荣称号。
