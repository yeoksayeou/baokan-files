    Radio Without a Vacuum Tube

    When I woke up, I habitually went to turn on the radio, but after fiddling with the switch for a long time, I didn't hear a sound. What's wrong? Is there a power outage, or is the radio broken? After some inspection, I discovered that the radio was missing a vacuum tube. Who took it, or was it broken? I thought, this time I'm bound to be blamed by Technician Hu, because this was his beloved possession.

    Who exactly took the vacuum tube? I asked everyone in the dormitory, but no one knew. I had to quickly tell the radio's owner about this. When I got to the factory, I heard that he and the workers were working on single-machine automation at the air compressor station, so I went straight in. A crowd of people surrounded the machine. I craned my neck to look inside, and sure enough, Technician Hu was in the middle of them. I was just about to call out to him when he saw me. "Xiao Luo, your timing is perfect. We are conducting an experiment with a machine listening device..." I looked at the five air compressors running side by side, humming. I wondered: Could it be that the vacuum tube from the radio is going to make a contribution to technological innovation? Sure enough, Technician Hu took out the vacuum tube from a box and explained it to me. It turned out that during normal production with these five air compressors, the operators had to hold a thin copper tube, more than two feet long, to their ears to hear whether the machine was running normally. This was both troublesome and inaccurate. The workers and Lao Hu needed a listening device when working on single-machine automation of the compressors. Someone suggested that a vacuum tube could be used instead, but one wasn't readily available, so Technician Hu silently took the vacuum tube from his own radio and used it.

    没有萤光灯的收音机
    一觉醒来，我习惯地去开收音机，拨了半天开关，一点声音也没听见。咋回事？是停电了，还是收音机出了毛病？经过一番检查，发现收音机上缺少了萤光灯。是谁拆走啦，还是打碎了？我想，这回可非受到胡技术员的责备不可了，因为这是他的心爱之物。
    究竟萤光灯被谁拆走了？我问遍了宿舍的人，大家都不知道，我得赶快把这件事告诉收音机的主人。到了工厂，听说他和工人在空气压缩站搞单机自动化，我就一直走了进去。机器旁围满了一群人，我伸着脖子朝里一瞧，胡技术员果真在当中。我正想喊他，他却看见我了。“小罗，你来的正是时候，我们正在进行机器听音器的试验……”我望着五台并排的空气压缩机正在嗡嗡地运转，心里想：莫非是收音机上的萤光灯要为技术革新立功吗？果然胡技术员从箱子里拿出了萤光灯向我解说了一番。原来这五台空气压缩机，在正常生产时，操作人员手里要拿一根二尺多长的细铜管子，放在耳朵上，才能听到机器运转的声音是否正常。这样既麻烦又不准确。工人和老胡在搞压缩机单机自动化时需要听音机。有人说用萤光灯可以代替，但一时又不凑手，胡技术员就一声不响地把自己收音机上的萤光灯拆了下来用上了。
