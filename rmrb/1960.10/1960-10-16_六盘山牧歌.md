　　Pastoral Song of Liupan Mountain
　　Climbing Liupan Mountain,
　　The peak touches the sky.
　　The sheep on the mountainside are like floating clouds, oh!
　　Group after group.
　　It used to be barren mountains,
　　Today it has become fertile land.
　　Cattle pulling plows run around the mountain, oh!
　　String after string.
　　The mountain has six turns,
　　The land is fertile and the people are diligent.
　　Clear spring water is led up the mountain, oh!
　　Dry land becomes paddy fields.
　　The spring breeze is warm and the sun is mild,
　　Hundreds of flowers bloom vying for beauty,
　　Chairman Mao once passed Liupan Mountain, oh!
　　Poor mountains become rich mountains.

### 六盘山牧歌

    六盘山牧歌登上六盘山，头儿擦着天。山腰羊群像浮云哟！一团连一团。过去是荒山，今日变良田。牛拉犁耙绕山跑哟！一串连一串。山儿有六盘，地肥人不懒。清清泉水引上山哟！旱地成水田。春风日和暖，百花齐争艳，毛主席一过六盘山哟！穷山变富山。
