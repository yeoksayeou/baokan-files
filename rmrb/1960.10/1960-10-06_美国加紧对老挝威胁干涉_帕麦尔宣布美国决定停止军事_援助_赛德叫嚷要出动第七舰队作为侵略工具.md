    Xinhua News Agency, 1st.  Williston Palmer, head of the US Department of Defense Military Assistance Program, announced twice today in Saigon and Manila that the United States had "stopped" military assistance to the Royal Lao Government. This shows that US imperialism is attempting to further pressure the Royal Lao Government and interfere in Laotian internal affairs by cutting off military aid.
    According to a United Press International dispatch from Saigon, Palmer announced the US decision at Saigon airport before flying from Saigon to Manila, saying it was "due to the extremely chaotic situation in Laos." However, the news agency said that Palmer announced the US decision to cut off military aid to Laos several hours after the Royal Lao Government in Vientiane announced that it would establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.
    According to Reuters, in the last fiscal year, the United States provided approximately $25.4 million in military aid under various guises to the pro-American former Lao government. $11 million was used to maintain the 29,000-strong reactionary troops of the former Lao government, and $6.5 million was used to equip these reactionary troops. The United States also played a role in training the Laotian reactionary army.
    Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Manila News: The new Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, Sides, openly clamored in Manila on the 4th that the United States should interfere in the internal affairs of Laos and other Asian countries. He said that due to the "crisis" in Laos, the US Seventh Fleet is prepared to "find ways to keep the free people of Asia free."
    Sides is conducting conspiratorial activities in the Western Pacific region recently for the first time since he took office as Commander of the US Pacific Fleet on September 1st. He is currently holding talks with those responsible for the Philippine Department of National Defense in Manila.
    In a conversation with reporters, Sides admitted that the Seventh Fleet is a tool for US aggression in the Far East, saying, "The Seventh Fleet will always be stationed in the right place at the right time when things happen." He clamored that the US military will soon "possess a considerable number of new missiles and new weapons." Sides blatantly declared that the Seventh Fleet's scope of activities "extends from Japan south to Southeast Asia." This shows that US imperialism regards the Western Pacific as an American inland lake.

### 美国加紧对老挝威胁干涉  帕麦尔宣布美国决定停止军事“援助”  赛德叫嚷要出动第七舰队作为侵略工具

    美国加紧对老挝威胁干涉
    帕麦尔宣布美国决定停止军事“援助”
    赛德叫嚷要出动第七舰队作为侵略工具
    新华社1日讯　美国国防部军事援助计划处头子威利斯顿·帕麦尔今天在西贡和马尼拉两次宣布，美国已经“停止”给老挝王国政府军事援助。这表明美帝国主义企图用断绝军事援助来进一步对老挝王国政府施加压力，干涉老挝内政。
    据合众国际社西贡消息，帕麦尔从西贡乘飞机前往马尼拉以前在西贡机场上宣布美国这一决定时说，这是“由于老挝局势非常混乱”。但是，这家通讯社说，帕麦尔是在老挝王国政府在万象宣布将同苏联建立外交关系以后若干小时宣布美国断绝给老挝军事援助的决定的。
    据路透社报道，去年财政年度中，美国以各种名目给亲美的前老挝政府的军事援助约二千五百四十万美元。有一千一百万美元用于维持两万九千名前老挝政府的反动军队，六百五十万美元用于武装这支反动军队的装备。美国还担任训练老挝反动军队的角色。
    新华社5日讯　马尼拉消息：新任美国驻太平洋海军总司令赛德4日在马尼拉公然叫嚣美国要干涉老挝和亚洲各国的内政。他说，由于老挝的“危机”，美国第七舰队准备“设法使亚洲的自由人民保持自由”。
    赛德自9月1日担任美国驻太平洋海军总司令以后，最近首次到西太平洋地区进行阴谋活动。目前他正在马尼拉同菲律宾国防部负责人士进行会谈。
    赛德在对新闻记者的谈话中承认第七舰队是美国在远东进行侵略的工具，他说，“第七舰队总会在事情发生的时候在适当的时刻驻在适当的地方”。他叫嚣说，美国军队即将“拥有相当多的新导弹和新武器”。赛德悍然宣称，第七舰队的活动范围是“从日本往南延伸到东南亚”。由此可见，美帝国主义把西太平洋当作了美国的内湖。
