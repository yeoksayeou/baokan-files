Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th: Mr. Takasaki Tatsunosuke, the former chief representative of Japan at the Bandung Conference, and his entourage, left Guangzhou today via Shenzhen to return home.

After arriving in Guangzhou on the 28th, Takasaki and his entourage were hosted at a banquet by Lin Qiangyun, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, that evening. Lin Qiangyun spoke at the banquet. He said that we admire Mr. Takasaki's good wishes, expressed during his visit to our country, to devote the rest of his life to the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. Lin Qiangyun said: The patriotic and righteous struggle of the Japanese people and the friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan are undoubtedly extremely beneficial to the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations and to peace in the Far East and the world. It is regrettable that Sino-Japanese relations are still in an abnormal state, which is completely contrary to the wishes of the people of both countries. We believe that this abnormal state will eventually be changed through the joint efforts of the people of both countries. We sincerely hope that Mr. Takasaki will make greater contributions to improving Sino-Japanese relations in the future.

Mr. Takasaki Tatsunosuke then spoke. He warmly praised the brilliant achievements of China's construction.

Takasaki Tatsunosuke said that China's construction has achieved such significant achievements due to the correct leadership of the Chinese leaders and the unity of the people throughout the country. He said: I will tell the Japanese people what I have heard and seen in China.

Takasaki Tatsunosuke said that five years ago, he had sincere talks with Premier Zhou Enlai in Bandung. Recently, he had several talks with Premier Zhou in Beijing. These heart-to-heart talks with Premier Zhou are my greatest gain. In the talks, both sides expressed that the principles of the Bandung Conference should be the direction of efforts to improve Sino-Japanese relations, and the two sides completely agreed on this point.

Takasaki Tatsunosuke said that Governor Lin mentioned just now that the current Sino-Japanese relations are in an abnormal state, which is a regret for the people of China and Japan. Takasaki Tatsunosuke finally said, "I swear here that as long as I am alive, I will definitely fight to the end to improve Sino-Japanese relations."

    高碕达之助离广州回国
    据新华社广州29日电　前出席万隆会议的日本首席代表高碕达之助先生及随行人员，今天离广州经深圳回国。
    高碕和他的随行人员在28日到达广州后，当天晚上广东省副省长林锵云设宴招待。林锵云在宴会上讲了话。他说，我们对于高碕先生在访问我国期间所表示的，愿意以他的余生为中日两国邦交正常化而努力的良好愿望，表示钦佩。林锵云说：日本人民的爱国正义斗争和中日两国人民的友好往来，毫无异疑，对于中日两国关系的改善和远东及世界和平是极其有利的。遗憾的是目前中日两国关系仍然处在不正常的状态中，这种不正常状态是完全违反中日两国人民的意愿的。我们相信，这样不正常的状态，在两国人民的共同努力下，终究会改变的。我们衷心希望高碕先生今后在改善中日两国关系方面做出更大的贡献。
    高碕达之助先生接着讲话。他热情地赞扬了中国建设事业的辉煌成就。
    高碕达之助说，中国建设取得那么重大的成就，这是由于中国领导人的正确领导和全国人民团结一致的结果。他说：我要把我在中国听到的和看到的回去告诉日本人民。
    高碕达之助说，五年前，在万隆和周恩来总理进行了真诚的谈话。最近，又在北京和周总理进行多次的交谈。和周总理的这些推心置腹的交谈，是我最大的收获。在谈话中，双方表示要以万隆会议的原则，作为改善中日两国关系的努力方向，在这一点上双方的意见完全一致。
    高碕达之助说，刚才林省长提到，目前中日两国关系处于不正常状态，这是中日两国人民的遗憾。高碕达之助最后说，我在这里宣誓，只要我的生命还在，我一定要为改善中日关系而奋斗到底。
