　　Zou Youwu, worker at Anshan Iron and Steel

　　Carelessly, my "big toe shoe" got a big hole burned in it by the red-hot steel slag. I ran to find Uncle Huo in a panic.

　　The warehouse door was wide open. Uncle Huo was sitting properly on a long bench, his head lowered, wearing his reading glasses, holding a work uniform, sewing stitch by stitch. He was so focused, like a young woman embroidering, that he didn't even notice me coming in.

　　"Uncle Huo, my shoes are unwearable."

　　Uncle Huo looked up, took off his reading glasses, sized me up, and then frowned and said, "It's you again, Little Li… I don't care!"

　　I knew he was angry again at me, this "careless fellow". I have this bad habit of not paying attention to my clothes. Whether it's work clothes or casual clothes, if they're new, they're sure to get big holes and small tears in them within two days. Because of this, I got a lot of grief from my wife at home, and even more at the factory. Ever since Uncle Huo became the warehouse manager, I've been "registered" with him.

　　When I heard Uncle Huo angrily say "I don't care," I really started to panic. It's not about whether the shoes are good or bad, it's about the impact on steelmaking. So, I rushed to Uncle Huo's front, and angrily raised my foot and said, "Look, how can I go to steelmaking like this?" I glanced at the watch on my wrist, "There are five minutes left before the steel comes out, quickly think of a way, my good Uncle Huo!"

　　"I don't care!" Uncle Huo pushed his reading glasses up the bridge of his nose and repeated "I don't care."

　　I knew I was in the wrong and had nothing to say, so I turned around and ran towards the workshop. I had only run a few steps when suddenly a strong, powerful hand came from behind and grabbed me firmly. I suddenly turned my head and saw that it was Uncle Huo. The old man was running out of breath, holding a pair of mended "big toe shoes" in one hand, and affectionately patted my shoulder and said, "Steelmaking is important, but people are also important, put them on quickly!"

　　I quickly sat down on a stone by the roadside, quickly took off the burned shoes, and when I picked up the "big toe shoes" that Uncle Huo brought, I was stunned. It turned out that these were the shoes I had broken last month, and the three characters "Little Li Zi" on the upper were still clearly visible! With a feeling of shame and gratitude, I quickly changed into the shoes, suddenly stood up, and looked at Uncle Huo with respectful and regretful eyes. He smiled knowingly and urged me repeatedly, "The time for the steel to come out is here, go quickly!"

    霍大爷
  　鞍钢工人　邹有武
  一不小心，我的“大头鞋”给红堂堂的钢渣烧了一个大窟窿。我连跑带颠地去找霍大爷。
    仓库门敞开着，霍大爷正端端地坐在一条长凳上，低着头，戴着老花镜，捧着工作服，一针一针地缝着。他那专心劲儿，就像大姑娘绣花似地，连我进门他都不知道。
    “霍大爷，我的鞋子不能穿了。”
    霍大爷抬起头来，把老花镜往下一摘，向我打量了一下，便皱起眉头说：“又是你，小李……我不管！”
    我知道，他这又是生我这“马大哈”的气了。我就是有这么一个坏毛病，对于穿戴一点也不知道经心。不论是工作服，还是便服，穿不上两天新的，准保给弄得净是大窟窿小眼子的。为了这个，在家里没少受孩子他妈的气，在厂里更不用说。打从霍大爷做仓库管理员起，我就在他那里“挂号”了。
    我一听霍大爷气呼呼地说“不管”，可真有点着慌了。不是么，鞋子好穿赖穿事小，影响了炼钢事大。于是，我一步抢到霍大爷的面前，也气呼呼地举起脚来说：“你看，这个样子怎么叫我去炼钢？”我看了一下腕子上的手表，“还有五分钟就要出钢了，快点想想办法吧，我的好霍大爷！”
      “不管！”霍大爷往鼻梁上推了推老花镜，又来了一个“不管”。
    我知道自己理亏，没话可说，只好掉过头来往车间跑。刚跑了几步，背后突然来了一只强有力的大手，把我牢牢地给擒住了。我猛然回头一看，原来是霍大爷。他老人家跑得上气不接下气的，一只手里提着一双修补好了的“大头鞋”，爱抚地拍着我的肩膀说：“炼钢要紧，人也要紧，快穿上！”
    我赶忙坐在路旁一块石头上，迅速地脱去烧坏了的鞋子，当我拿起霍大爷带来的那双“大头鞋”时，我愕然了。原来，这是我上月弄坏的那双鞋，鞋帮上的“小李子”三个字还清清楚楚的呢！我怀着又惭愧又感激的心情，迅速地换上了鞋，蓦地站起身来，用尊敬而懊悔的眼光望着霍大爷。他会意地微笑着，连连催我说：“出钢的时间到了，快去吧！”
