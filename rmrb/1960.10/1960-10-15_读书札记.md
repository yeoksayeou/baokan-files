    (III) The Earliest Chinese Books Introducing Cuba

    The Chinese people's concern and love for Cuba are not only expressed through life and labor but also reflected in books about Cuba. China had books describing Cuba almost a century ago①, and sixty years ago, people were already reading beautiful translated accounts of Columbus's discovery of Cuba②. By the end of the 19th century, there were already gazetteer-like special books about Cuba, poems and dramas praising Cuba and the Cuban Revolution, as well as essays.

    Here is a brief introduction to several of the most important ones:

    *Cuban Miscellany*. Written by Tan Qianchu from Shunde, Guangdong. This is the earliest known Chinese book specifically about Cuba. The original was published in the 13th year of the Guangxu reign (1887) and typeset by the Hong Kong Chinese Printing General Bureau. Later, there was a *Xiaofanghu Zhai Yudi Congchao* edition. Zhang Yinhuan wrote a preface, stating that the book "extracts the essentials of Cuba's customs and conditions, compiling them into notes, truly the work of a thoughtful person." The content mainly records Chinese workers on the island and the island's economic life. The records of products and customs are also detailed. However, due to the author's standpoint, the understanding of Chinese workers and the relationship between Chinese and Cubans is somewhat distorted. The despicable behavior of the Americans in provoking and undermining relations between Chinese and Cuban workers is also not revealed.

    *Illustrated Treatise on Travels in Cuba*, two volumes. Written by Fu Yunlong from Deqing. One of the books *Written in the Xuanxi Lu*. Published in the 15th year of Guangxu (1889), two years after *Cuban Miscellany* was printed. The entire book is volume 9, with 37 subheadings, divided into astronomy, geography, customs, food and goods, crafts, military system, official positions, politics, literature, etc., with an attached map of Cuba. It is entirely of the nature of an illustrated gazetteer and local chronicle. The author states in the preface that "although it is only two years apart from Tan's book, many changes have already taken place," and "sugar merchants are being encroached upon by neighbors, and the tobacco industry is also shrinking compared to the past." The description of Chinese workers is more concise than Tan's, but the facts differ. A more distinctive feature is the literary chronicle section, which records the poet Sima Yiya Heli and his signature, Chinese and Spanish books, and the stone inscriptions of Columbus's tomb hall and Columbus's statue, etc. Both books failed to expose the ferocity of the American colonialists, which is obviously due to the fact that both authors were diplomatic officials of the Qing court at the time and their class relations.

    *Poems on a Trip to Cuba*, one volume. Written by Fu Yunlong from Deqing. Typeset and printed in the 15th year of Guangxu (1889). This is a collection of poems about traveling in Cuba, included in the author's three-volume *Xuanxi Lu Travel Poems*. The other two volumes are *Poems on a Trip to Peru* and *Annals of Poems on a Trip to Brazil*. This is the earliest Chinese literary work praising Cuba.

    *"Xuehai Chao Legend*." Written by Chun Mengsheng. Published in *Xinmin Congbao* in the 29th year of Guangxu (1903). Only the *Narration*, *Prologue*, and the first scene *Literary Demon* have been found. This is the earliest Chinese drama praising the Cuban revolutionary movement. The content opposes colonialists, traitors, and oppressive atrocities, exposing that "garrison officers and prominent families collude and conspire" to persecute the people. The author writes that these people are "arrogant towards others, bowing and scraping with full pockets" (Soap Robe), "knowing each other widely in the court, relying on powerful officials." "Southern and Northern parties, netting and fishing, big officials and small officials, weighing higher and lower. Playing with power, I'll just give a blind mocking report" (Linyuan Hao). Unfortunately, it was interrupted without writing about positive heroes and was not continued.

    As for short articles about Cuba, such as Yu Siyi's *Brief Account of Cuba*, and those that partially touch on Cuba, such as Zhang Yinhuan's *Three Continents Diary* and Li Shuchang's *Chunzhai Miscellany* (both found in *Western Magazines*), there are even more. The *Heroic Struggle of the Cuban People* (one of the *Documents of Communist Parties in Various Countries*), translated and printed by World Knowledge Publishing House in 1959, further marks the arduous journey and glorious achievements of Cuba's recent struggle for independence and defense of the Cuban Revolution.

    ① Such as Zhi Gang's *First Mission to the West* (1867)
    ② Such as *Colombo* (1902)

    （三）最早介绍古巴的中国书
    中国人民对于古巴的关怀、热爱，不但用生命和劳动表达了，同样也反映在有关古巴的书籍里。中国差不多在一个世纪前，就有叙述到古巴的书①，六十年前就已读到哥伦布发现古巴的优美记叙译文②。十九世纪末，就已有了志书一类的关于古巴的专籍，讴歌古巴及古巴革命的诗歌和戏曲，以及散文等等。
    这里简略的介绍几种最主要的：
    《古巴杂记》。广东顺德谭乾初撰。这是所知中国最早印行的关于古巴的专书。原本刊于光绪13年（1887），香港中华印务总局排印本。后有《小方壶斋舆地丛钞》本。书前有张荫桓叙，称此书于古巴“风土人情，撷其要领，汇为笔记，诚有心人也”。内容以记录岛内中国工人及全岛经济生活为主。物产风俗，记载亦详。但对中国工人，对中国人与古巴人的关系，由于作者立场关系，认识颇有歪曲。对美国佬在中古工人间挑拨破坏等等卑劣行为也没有揭露。
    《游历古巴图经》二卷。德清傅云龙撰。《籑喜庐所著书》之一。刊于光绪15年（1889），即《古巴杂记》印行后二年。全书为卷9，为子目37，分天文、地理、风俗、食货、考工、兵制、职官、政事、文学等目，并附古巴全图。完全是图志、地志性质。自叙谓“与谭书虽相隔只2年，已有许多变易”，“糖商浸被邻夺，淡巴菰工亦视昔数缩”。关于中国工人的叙述，较谭著简略，事则互有差异。较特色的是文艺志部分，著录了诗人司马宜牙赫力及押名字，中文及西班牙文典籍，和金石哥伦布墓堂诗碣、哥伦布石像文，等等。两书对美殖民主义者都未能揭发其凶恶，这显然是由于两著者都是当时清庭的外交官员，及其阶级关系。
    《游古巴诗董》一卷。德清傅云龙撰。光绪15年（1889）排印本。这是一部古巴纪游的诗集，收在作者《籑喜庐游历诗》三卷本内。其他二卷，是《游秘鲁诗鉴》和《游巴西诗志》。这是最早歌咏古巴的中国文学作品。
    《学海潮传奇》。春梦生撰。载光绪29年（1903）《新民丛报》。仅见到《叙事》、《楔子》和第一出《文妖》。这是中国讴歌古巴革命运动最早的戏曲。内容反对殖民主义者、反对汉奸、反对压制暴行，揭穿“驻防官军，清门世族，狼狈为奸”，迫害人民。作者写这些人是“龙门狗洞向人骄，奴颜婢膝腰囊饱”（皂罗袍），“满庭阔老知己交，宫门大叔泰山靠。南党北党，网儿打捞，大官小官，秤儿低高。弄威权我只索打个瞎嘲报”（林园好）。可惜没有写到正面英雄人物，就中断了，没有续写下去。
    至于写古巴的短章，如余思诒的《古巴述略》，部分接触到古巴的如张荫桓《三洲日记》、黎庶昌《莼斋杂记》（并见《西洋杂志》），等等，那就更多了。至1959年世界知识出版社译印的《古巴人民的英勇斗争》（《各国共产主义政党文从》之一），更是标识着古巴近年来争取独立，保卫古巴革命的艰苦历程和光荣战果。
    ①如志刚《初使泰西记》（1867）
    ②如《哥伦波》（1902）
