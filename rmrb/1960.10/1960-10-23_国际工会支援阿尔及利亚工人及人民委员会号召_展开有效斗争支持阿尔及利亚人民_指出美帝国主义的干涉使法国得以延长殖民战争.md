Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 21st. The Third Conference of the International Trade Union Committee for Support of Algerian Workers and People, which opened on the 17th, closed here today. The conference adopted the "Appeal to Workers and Trade Unions Worldwide" and the "Letter to Algerian Workers."

Participants in the conference included Louis Saillant, Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions; Asaad Raji, Secretary-General of the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions; Diallo Seydou, Secretary-General of the General Union of Black African Workers; Mahjoub Abdelkader, First Secretary of the General Union of Algerian Workers; and representatives from the Soviet Union, China, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Indonesia, Chile, Argentina, Cuba, Panama, Mali, and other countries.

The "Appeal to Workers and Trade Unions Worldwide" stated: The colonial war in Algeria is entering its seventh year. For six years, the heroic Algerian people have been waging a valiant struggle for their independence and to free themselves from oppression and poverty. This struggle threatens a repressive army of 800,000 men, and thus threatens the hateful rule of French colonialists, supported by US imperialism.

The appeal stated that the colonial war in Algeria is not only a provocation to public opinion, but also an attack on human rights and democratic rights. Due to the conspiracy carried out under the so-called "Atlantic solidarity," and due to the increasingly intensified intervention by monopoly groups headed by US imperialism, the reactionary colonialist forces of France have been able to prolong this criminal war and continue to implement its policy of rule and exploitation of Algeria's national resources in Algeria.

The appeal stated that the just struggle of the Algerian people is the common struggle of working people in all countries around the world. It is no longer enough for the masses to merely make resolutions; other more effective actions should be taken.

The appeal pointed out that a huge task is now placed before the workers of all countries: to use their struggle to force the cessation of the war in Algeria on the basis of the Algerian people's legitimate exercise of self-determination and recognition of Algerian independence. The appeal stated that the broadest masses of workers must be mobilized to struggle against the policies of colonialism and imperialism, and to thwart all conspiracies attempting to oppress the Algerian people forever.

The appeal called on the people of all countries to take all feasible actions: workers' strikes, people's demonstrations, and other stronger means, to support the struggle of the Algerian people.

The appeal stated that the committee notes with satisfaction that many countries have recognized the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic. The committee believes that this recognition is a practical action that creates a fighting atmosphere for the Algerian people and increases their ability to act on the international stage.

The appeal called on all workers and trade unions in the world to organize a Support Algeria Day in November this year, and asked them to strengthen material assistance to Algeria.

The "Letter to Algerian Workers" expressed deep sympathy and effective support to the Algerian working class and people who are waging a heroic and tenacious struggle against colonialism and imperialism and for freedom and independence. It also expressed respect for the heroism and sacrifice of the Algerian National Liberation Army. The committee pledged to do everything possible to strengthen support and assistance to the Algerian people in rebuilding peace on the basis of obtaining the right to independence.

The International Trade Union Committee for Support of Algerian Workers and People expressed its conviction that Algerian workers and people, through their own heroic struggle and with the active support of working people around the world, will surely achieve liberation and realize all their aspirations.

The meeting also passed a telegram to the French government condemning the French authorities' colonial war policy.

    国际工会支援阿尔及利亚工人及人民委员会号召
    展开有效斗争支持阿尔及利亚人民
    指出美帝国主义的干涉使法国得以延长殖民战争
    新华社哈瓦那21日电　17日召开的国际工会支援阿尔及利亚工人及人民委员会第三次会议今天在这里闭幕。会议通过了“致全世界工人和工会号召书”和“致阿尔及利亚工人书”。
    参加这次会议的有世界工会联合会书记路易吉·葛拉西，阿拉伯工会国际联合会总书记阿萨德·拉吉，黑非洲工人总联合会总书记迪亚洛·赛杜，阿尔及利亚工人总联合会第一书记马舒·阿卜杜勒·卡德尔以及苏联、中国、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国、印度尼西亚、智利、阿根廷、古巴、巴拿马、马里等国代表。
    “致全世界工人和工会号召书”说：在阿尔及利亚进行的殖民战争正进入第七年。六年来，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民为争取自己的独立以及摆脱压迫和贫困进行了英勇的斗争。这一斗争威胁着一支拥有八十万人的镇压军队，因而也就威胁到法国殖民主义者在美帝国主义的支持下实行的令人憎恨的统治。
    号召书说，在阿尔及利亚进行的殖民主义战争不仅是对公众舆论的挑衅，而且是对人权和民主权利的进攻。由于根据所谓的“大西洋团结”而进行的阴谋勾结，由于以美帝国主义为首的垄断集团日益加剧的干涉，法国的反动殖民主义势力得以延长这次罪恶的战争，并且在阿尔及利亚继续执行它的统治和榨取阿尔及利亚国家富源的政策。
    号召书说，阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争是全世界各国劳动者的共同斗争。现在对人民群众来说，仅仅做出决议已经不够了，应当采取其他更有效的行动。
    号召书指出，现在在各国工人面前提出了一项巨大的任务，用他们的斗争强使在阿尔及利亚人民合法行使自决权和承认阿尔及利亚独立的基础上停止在阿尔及利亚进行的战争。号召书说，必须动员最广泛的工人群众进行斗争，以便反对殖民主义和帝国主义的政策，挫败一切企图永远压迫阿尔及利亚人民的阴谋。
    号召书号召世界各国人民采取一切可行的行动方式：工人罢工、人民的示威游行以及其他更强烈的方式，来支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。
    号召书说，委员会很满意地注意到许多国家都承认了阿尔及利亚共和国的临时政府。委员会认为这种承认是造成阿尔及利亚人民的战斗气氛的实际行动，并且增加了他们在国际舞台上的活动可能性。
    号召书号召世界所有的劳动者和工会在今年11月组织支援阿尔及利亚日，并且要求它们加强对阿尔及利亚的物质援助。
    “致阿尔及利亚工人书”对展开英勇顽强的反对殖民主义和帝国主义、争取自由和独立的斗争的阿尔及利亚工人阶级和人民表示深切的同情和有效的支持。并且向阿尔及利亚民族解放军的英雄气概和牺牲精神表示敬意。委员会保证将尽一切可能加强支援和帮助阿尔及利亚人民在获得独立的权利的基础上重建和平。
    国际工会支援阿尔及利亚工人及人民委员会表示确信阿尔及利亚劳动者和人民在自己英勇的斗争下和全世界劳动人民的积极支持下，必将取得解放和实现自己的全部愿望。
    会议还通过了给法国政府的电报，谴责法国当局的殖民战争政策。
