The season for the large-scale harvesting, cutting, processing, stripping, and selling of technical crops such as flue-cured tobacco, bast fiber crops, and autumn tea has arrived. Amidst the vigorous agricultural product purchasing campaign centered on grain, cotton, and oil crops, a mass movement to sell tobacco, bast fibers, and tea is taking shape. The famous flue-cured tobacco producing area of Xuchang Prefecture in Henan Province purchased more than 11,900 dan of tobacco leaves on September 8th alone, breaking the highest purchase volume since the new tobacco came on the market this year. The purchase volume of bast fiber crops and autumn tea producing areas is also rising rapidly. The problem now is that the purchasing progress in areas that are relatively slow needs to be strengthened. Immediate measures should be taken to earnestly mobilize the broad masses to make the mass sales movement widespread and in-depth, in order to accelerate the purchasing progress.

The purchasing work of tobacco, bast fiber crops, and tea also involves the arrangement of labor. Based on the principle of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, all available full labor and semi-labor forces should be mobilized: organize various specialized teams and temporary shock brigades, divide the battle lines, use labor rationally, and improve labor efficiency. It is necessary to combine professional picking with mass picking, and combine shock picking with regular picking; it is necessary to do a good job in harvesting major agricultural products, and also take care of the harvesting of other agricultural products; it is necessary to do a good job in picking and processing, and also do a good job in transportation and sales. In short, the labor force required for each variety and each link should be arranged properly and implemented. In the picking of tobacco leaves, attention should be paid to collecting all the tobacco leaves. In the past, the bottom leaves, tops, and suckers discarded in the tobacco fields may seem insignificant from a single tobacco field, but if they are widely collected, it will be a large quantity. These things are of high utilization value and should all be collected this year. Tea producing areas should collect all the tea leaves that should be picked based on the growth of autumn tea, but also pay attention to preventing over-picking and damaging the vitality of the tea trees. For substandard hemp, the same must be done and it must be harvested as much as possible for utilization. It should be recognized that the quality of the harvest in the few days of the harvest season is directly related to the results of several months of hard work. Therefore, the harvest work must be very meticulous: if one hundred catties can be harvested, ninety-nine catties must not be harvested, and if one more tobacco leaf or one more hemp plant can be harvested, they must not be discarded; in short, the more the better, and the wealth in the fields should be harvested without losing a bit. To this end, we must repeatedly conduct propaganda and education work to the broad masses, so that they understand that doing the picking work carefully and meticulously can increase the harvest volume, which is not only beneficial to the country, but also beneficial to the commune and the members.

Doing a good job in harvesting is only the first step in doing a good job in purchasing. Experience over the years has proved that whether the processing of agricultural products can keep up closely is a decisive link in whether the purchasing task can be completed quickly and well. Agricultural products, especially technical crops, must be processed in a timely manner after harvest, otherwise they are prone to damage and waste. The initial processing stage is more complicated and meticulous than the harvest. Therefore, our work in this stage must also be solid and meticulous, and we must not relax in the slightest. For example, the quality of tobacco leaf baking and whether the grading is clear and accurate not only largely affects the quantity and quality of tobacco leaves, and is related to whether the country can purchase a sufficient quantity of high-quality tobacco leaves, but also related to the income of rural people's communes and members. In purchasing, commercial departments in various producing areas must earnestly grasp this link, organize forces to go deep into the communes and production teams in the tobacco producing areas, and earnestly help solve various specific problems in the processing work, such as helping to solve the fuel required for flue-curing tobacco, helping to impart and promote advanced processing technologies, training baking and grading personnel, and establishing necessary responsibility systems and reward systems, in order to improve the yield and quality of tobacco leaves and accelerate the purchasing progress. In the processing of bast fiber crops, the main task is to solve the problem of decorticating machines. Vigorously promoting advanced decorticating machines is an important measure to improve work efficiency, save labor, and accelerate the speed of stripping and purchasing.

In the vigorous mass sales movement, as long as we adhere to politics in command, rely on the masses in specific purchasing operations, and closely combine full political enthusiasm with a solid and meticulous work style, and widely carry out the collaboration of various relevant departments, we will certainly be able to successfully realize the purchasing tasks of agricultural products such as tobacco, bast fiber crops, and tea.

    积极收购烤烟、麻类和秋茶
    烤烟、麻类和秋茶等技术作物大量采摘、收割，大量加工、剥制，大量交售的季节已经到来。在大搞以粮食、棉花、油料为中心的农产品收购运动中，一个群众性的烟、麻、茶交售运动也正在形成，著名的烤烟产区河南许昌专区早在9月8日一天即收购了一万一千九百多担烟叶，突破了今年新烟上市以来的最高收购量；麻类、秋茶产区的收购量也在迅速上升；现在的问题是，收购进度还比较慢的地区，要加强采购力量，并且立即采取措施认真动员广大群众，使群众性的交售运动普遍而深入地开展起来，以加快收购进度。
    烟、麻、茶的收购工作也有劳动力的安排问题。要本着统筹兼顾，全面安排的原则，把一切能够动员的整劳动力、半劳动力都动员起来：组织各种专业队和临时突击队，分开战线，合理使用，提高劳动效率。要做到专业采摘和群众采摘相结合、突击采摘和经常采摘相结合；既要做好主要农产品的收获工作，又要照顾到其它农产品的收获工作；既要做好采摘、加工，又要做好调运、交售。总之，应该把各个品种，各个环节所需的劳动力都安排妥善、落实。在烟叶采摘中，应该注意把所有的烟叶都收上来。以往抛弃在烟田里的土脚烟叶、烟顶、烟杈等，从一块烟田看起来微不足道，但如果广泛收集起来，就是很大的数量，这些东西利用价值很高，今年要全部收上来。茶叶产区应该根据秋茶生长情况，把所有应该采摘的茶叶全部收摘下树，但也要注意防止采摘过度，损害茶树生机。对下脚麻，同样也要尽可能地全部收获起来加以利用。应该认识到，在收获时节的几天当中，收获工作做得好坏，直接关系着几个月辛勤劳动的成果。因此收获工作一定要十分细致：能收摘一百斤的，就决不收九十九斤，能多收一片烟叶、一株麻的就决不把它们丢弃掉；总之，应当多多益善，把田里的财富一点不丢地收获起来。为此，就要向广大群众反复地进行宣传教育工作，使他们懂得收摘工作做得认真、细致，就能提高收获量，这不仅对国家有利，而且对公社对社员也有利。
    把收获工作做好，这还仅仅是做好收购工作的第一步。几年来的经验证明，农产品加工工作能否紧紧跟上去，就成为能否又快又好地完成收购任务的决定性环节了。农产品，特别是技术作物，在收获以后，必须及时加工处理，否则就容易损坏和浪费。而初步加工环节比起收获来更要复杂细致。因此，在这个环节上我们的工作也更要扎实细致，不能丝毫放松。例如烟叶烘烤得好坏，等级分得是否清楚、准确，这不仅在很大程度上影响着烟叶的数量和质量、关系着国家能否收购到数量充足、品质优良的烟叶，而且也关系到农村人民公社和社员的收入。各产区商业部门在收购中，一定要认真抓好这一环节，组织力量深入到产烟区的公社和生产队去，切实认真地帮助解决加工工作的各种具体问题，例如帮助解决烤烟需用的燃料，帮助传授和推广先进的加工技术，培训烘烤、分级人员，建立必要的责任制度和奖励制度，以便提高烟叶的产量和质量，加快收购进度。在麻类的加工问题上，主要是解决剥麻机具的问题。大力推广先进的剥麻机具，是提高工效、节省劳动力、加速剥制和收购进度的一项重要措施。
    在轰轰烈烈的群众性的交售运动中，只要我们在具体的收购业务中坚持政治挂帅、依靠群众，并把饱满的政治热情和踏实细致的工作作风紧密结合起来，广泛开展各有关部门的协作，我们就一定能够胜利地实现烟、麻、茶等农产品的收购任务。
