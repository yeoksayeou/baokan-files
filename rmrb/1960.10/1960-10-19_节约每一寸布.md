    Save Every Inch of Cloth
    The employees of the garment workshop at the New Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory in Xi'an have achieved results in their campaign to save every inch of cloth. From August 9th to September 23rd, they have saved 23,146 feet of cotton cloth.
    Saving every inch of cloth is very important to this workshop. For example, when the cloth measurers open the cloth, they often cut off an inch or even several inches of good cloth. If the cloth openers improve their operations and save one inch of cloth from each bolt, they can save fifty feet per worker per day, assuming each worker opens five hundred bolts a day. With twenty-four cloth openers, a large amount of cotton cloth can be saved in a year. Through detailed accounting, the workers realized that the potential for increasing production and practicing economy is indeed great. Immediately afterward, the workshop's Party branch mobilized each group and individual to formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy, launching a competition to save every inch of cloth. In the competition, the Party branch paid attention to planting red flags and establishing pacesetters, promoting the continuous advancement of the movement. In one month, the entire workshop selected twelve pacesetters, four advanced machine stations, and five advanced groups.
    After taking these measures, this workshop not only achieved results in saving cotton cloth, but also greatly improved its output and quality.

    节约每一寸布
    西安新西北印染厂整装车间职工开展节约一寸布的活动取得成绩，从8月9日到9月23日，已节约棉布二万三千一百四十六尺。
    节约每一寸布对这个车间有很重要的意义。例如，码布工在开布的时候，经常剪去一寸甚至几寸好布。如果开布工改进操作，从每一匹布中节约一寸布，以一个工人一天开五百匹计算，就可以节约五十尺，二十四个开布工一年就可以节约大量的棉布。通过算细账，职工们认识到增产节约潜力确实很大。紧接着，车间党支部就发动每个小组和个人制定增产节约计划，开展节约一寸布的竞赛活动。在竞赛中，党支部注意插红旗、立标兵，促使运动不断前进，一个月中，全车间就评选出了十二个标兵，四个先进机台和五个先进小组。
    采取这些措施以后，这个车间不仅在节约棉布方面取得成绩，产量、质量也都大大提高。
