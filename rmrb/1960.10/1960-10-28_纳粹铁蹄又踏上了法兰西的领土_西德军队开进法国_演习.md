Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 26th: German militarist troops, which occupied France twice in thirty years, marched into France today under the guise of the West German "Federal Defence Force" for an "exercise."

The first batch of over two hundred soldiers of the Federal Defence Force are the advance troops of two thousand four hundred paratroopers and armored infantry, scheduled to conduct a three-week exercise at two military training grounds in Champagne, France, in early November.

The entry of West German troops into France follows closely on the heels of the signing of a "Logistics Base Scope Treaty" between the two countries in Paris yesterday, which stipulates that West Germany can establish "logistics bases" and conduct military exercises on French territory.

According to reports, in order to prevent French residents from demonstrating against the entry of West German troops into their territory, the French authorities blocked the news from the people, while West Germany adopted deceptive tactics. The West German Minister of Defence in Bonn ordered West German soldiers heading to France to change into tea-brown uniforms specially prepared for them, leaving the traditional mouse-grey uniforms in West German barracks. The West German "Defence Force" headquarters believes that by changing the uniforms of West German soldiers in France to brown, they can be confused with the American and British soldiers that the French people are already accustomed to.

The resurrected West German militarism is not only seeking development on the European continent but also intends to expand overseas. According to sources here, West German Defence Minister Strauss, currently in Canada, is negotiating with the Canadian government about the issue of West German air force conducting military training in Canada.

### 纳粹铁蹄又踏上了法兰西的领土  西德军队开进法国“演习”

    纳粹铁蹄又踏上了法兰西的领土
    西德军队开进法国“演习”
    据新华社波恩26日电　三十年内两次占领法国的德国军国主义军队，今天在西德“联邦国防军”的身份下以“演习”为名开进了法国。
    第一批二百多名联邦国防军士兵是二千四百名伞兵和装甲步兵的先遣部队，这支部队定于11月初在法国香巴尼的两个军事演习场上进行为期三周的演习。
    西德军队开进法国是紧接着昨天两国在巴黎签订了一项“后勤基地范围条约”之后进行的，这项条约中规定西德在法国领土上建立“后勤基地”和进行军事演习。
    据报道，为了防止法国居民示威反对西德军队进入他们的领土，法国当局对人民封锁了这一消息，西德则采取了欺骗手段。波恩国防部长命令开往法国的西德士兵都换上了专门为他们准备的茶褐色军服，而把传统的鼠色军服留在西德兵营里。西德“国防军”司令部认为，西德在法国的士兵换上了褐色的军装，就可以同法国人已经习惯了的美国和英国士兵混淆起来。
    复活了的西德军国主义不仅在西欧大陆上寻求发展，而且还打算向海外发展。据这里消息透露，现在在加拿大的西德国防部长施特劳斯正在同加拿大政府商谈关于西德空军在加拿大进行军事训练的问题。
