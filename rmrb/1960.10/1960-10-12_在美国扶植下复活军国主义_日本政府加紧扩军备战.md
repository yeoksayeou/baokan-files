Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese "Akahata" published an article on the 4th, exposing that the Japanese "Defense Agency" is attempting to jointly establish a Japan-US joint operations headquarters with the US military, strengthen the Japanese military's nuclear war preparations, and use the military to strengthen the suppression of the people. They are plotting to implement this plan immediately after the Japanese general election. The article stated that the "Defense Agency" also intends to establish a Japan-US military special committee under the Japan-US "Security Consultative Committee," and that the Chief of Staff of Japan (Chairman of the Joint Staff Council) will unify the command of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in accordance with the US Far East strategy.

According to a report by "Yomiuri Shimbun" on the 1st, the US military stationed in Japan has requested the Japanese government to provide land in Yamaguchi Prefecture in western Japan to establish a bombing "exercise range." The newspaper also revealed that US jet bombers conducting bombing "exercises" in Yamaguchi Prefecture will take off from Iwakuni base to conduct bombing "exercises" including atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, as well as machine gun strafing "exercises."

"Defense Agency" Tries Hard to Develop Militaristic Forces and Restore Wartime Emperor's Military Parade

Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Tokyo: According to a report by "Yomiuri Shimbun" on the 10th, Japanese "Defense Agency" Director-General Masumi Ezaki recently openly suggested to the Grand Chamberlain of Japan, Usami, that the practice of the Emperor inspecting the army during wartime and before the war should be restored.

"Yomiuri Shimbun" said that the "Defense Agency" will hold a joint meeting with the Imperial Household Agency to determine the details of the Emperor's military parade.

This is another new step taken by the US-Japan reactionaries to conspire to expand the Emperor's influence and develop Japanese militarist forces.

According to "Yomiuri Shimbun", Masumi Ezaki's excuse for advocating the Emperor's military parade this time is: "If the Emperor does not inspect the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, it means that the 'symbol of the country,' the Emperor himself, does not give the Self-Defense Forces the respect they deserve."

"Defense Agency" Director-General Masumi Ezaki Clamors that Military Expansion is Japan's "Current Urgent Task"

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo dispatch: Japanese government "Defense Agency" Director-General Masumi Ezaki admitted to reporters on the 7th while inspecting the Japanese Army in Mie Prefecture that the current Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" are "undoubtedly a military in practice." Masumi Ezaki also openly clamored at a meeting of Army, Navy, and Air Force officers that "Japan needs to step up preparations for defense capabilities based on the (Japan-US) security system." He said that this is Japan's "current urgent task." He emphasized that the Japanese military should maintain sufficient combat power. The news revealed that according to Ezaki's instructions, the 140 senior military officers attending the meeting discussed the issue of Japan's military expansion.

At the same time, Japanese Chiefs of Staff of the three services, Keizo Hayashi, told reporters on the 7th that the Japanese government is planning to reorganize the Japanese Army into 13 divisions within two years to strengthen its combat power.

Liberal Democratic Party Publishes Booklet Declaring Intention to Revise Constitution Prohibiting Warfare

Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Liberal Democratic Party yesterday published a booklet explaining the government and ruling party's "new policies," blatantly declaring its intention to revise the constitution that prohibits Japan from participating in wars and prohibits the possession of combat power.

The booklet openly stated: The current constitution was formulated shortly after World War II, saying that it "is now outdated and no longer conforms to the current situation in Japan. Therefore, it is necessary to re-examine its content and revise it."

When discussing Japan's relations with the Soviet Union, the booklet once again exposed the Japanese ruling clique's imperialist ambitions for Soviet territory. The booklet said that a peace treaty could only be concluded with the Soviet Union if the Soviet Union "returned Japan's northern territories to Japan."

In this booklet, the Liberal Democratic Party also slandered China for "interfering in Japan's internal affairs" on the issue of the anti-China, Japan-US military alliance treaty. Regarding Japan-China relations, the Liberal Democratic Party continues to block the path to restoring normal relations with China, saying that Japan's relations with China should be limited to private trade and cultural exchanges.

Monopoly Capital Groups Actively Demand Government Funding to Develop the Arms Industry

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo dispatch: According to "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," the Defense Production Committee of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations has decided to submit a written opinion to "Defense Agency" Director-General Masumi Ezaki, requesting the "Defense Agency" to systematically purchase weapons manufactured by the monopoly capitalists' munitions factories and to bear all costs for monopoly capital companies to research and manufacture new weapons such as rockets.

The Defense Production Committee also requested the government to bear all the costs of maintaining and repairing special military facilities such as radar.

According to reports, to date, forty-seven large munitions manufacturing factories, including Shin Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, have submitted the above-mentioned requests to the Defense Production Committee of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations. The written opinion to be submitted by this committee is based on these opinions.

    在美国扶植下复活军国主义
    日本政府加紧扩军备战
    加紧进行核战争准备
    日美计划建立联合作战总部
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本“赤旗报”4日发表文章揭露，日本“防卫厅”正企图同美军共同建立日美联合作战总部，加强日本军队的核战争准备，并且利用军队加强对人民的镇压。它们阴谋在日本大选结束后立即实行这个计划。文章说，“防卫厅”还企图在日美“安全协商委员会”下面设立日美军事专门委员会，并按照美国的远东战略由日本的幕僚长（参谋长）联席会议来统一指挥陆、海、空三军。
    据“读卖新闻”1日报道，驻日美军要求日本政府在日本西部的山口县提供土地，以建立轰炸“演习场”。这家报纸还透露，在山口县进行轰炸“演习”的美军喷气式轰炸机将从岩国基地起飞，进行包括原子弹和氢弹在内的轰炸“演习”和机枪扫射“演习”。
    “防卫厅”竭力发展军国主义势力要恢复战时天皇检阅军队办法
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：据“读卖新闻”10日报道，日本“防卫厅”长官江崎真澄最近公然向宫内厅长官宇佐美提出建议，要求恢复战时和战前天皇检阅军队的做法。
    “读卖新闻”说，“防卫厅”将和宫内厅举行联席会议，来确定天皇检阅军队的细节。
    这是美日反动派阴谋扩大天皇的影响、发展日本军国主义势力的又一个新步骤。
    据“读卖新闻”透露，江崎真澄这次主张天皇检阅军队的借口是：“如果天皇不检阅日本的自卫队，这意味着‘国家的象征’天皇本人也不给自卫队以应有的尊重。”
    “防卫厅”长官江崎真澄叫嚣扩军是日本“当前紧急任务”
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本政府“防卫厅”长官江崎真澄7日在三重县视察日本陆军时对新闻记者承认，日本现在的“自卫队”，“实际上无疑是军队”。江崎真澄在一次陆海空军军官会议上还公然叫嚣说，“日本需要根据（日美）安全体制来加紧准备防卫力量”。他说，这是日本“当前的紧急任务”。他强调日本军队要保有足够的作战力量。消息透露，根据江崎的这个指示，出席会议的一百四十名高级军官讨论了日本的扩军问题。
    同时，日本三军参谋总长林敬三7日向记者表示，日本政府正在计划在两年内把日本陆军改编为十三个师，来加强作战力量。
    自由民主党发表小册子宣称要修改禁止作战的宪法
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本自由民主党昨天发表说明政府和执政党“新政策”的小册子，明目张胆地宣称要修改禁止日本参战和禁止保有作战力量的宪法。
    这个小册子公然说：现行宪法是在第二次世界大战后不久制订的，说它“现在已经过时了，已经不符合日本的现状。因此，有必要重新审查它的内容和修改它。”
    小册子在谈到日本同苏联的关系时再次暴露了日本统治集团对苏联领土的帝国主义野心。小册子说什么只有苏联“把日本北部领土归还日本”，才同苏联缔结和约。
    自由民主党在这个小册子中还诬蔑中国在敌视中国的日美军事同盟条约问题上“干涉日本内政”。关于日中关系，自由民主党继续堵塞同中国恢复正常关系的道路，说什么日本同中国的关系应当以私人贸易和文化交流为限。
    垄断资本集团大肆活动要求政府资助发展军火工业
    据新华社讯　东京消息：据“日本经济新闻”报道，日本经济团体联合会防卫生产委员会决定将向“防卫厅”长官江崎真澄提出意见书，要求“防卫厅”有计划地购买垄断资本家的军火工厂制造的武器，并承担垄断资本公司研究和制造火箭等新式武器的一切费用。
    防卫生产委员会并且要求政府负担维持和补修雷达等特殊军事设施的全部费用。
    据报道，截至目前为止，已经有新三菱重工业公司等四十七家大军火制造工厂向经济团体联合会防卫生产委员会提出了上述的要求。这个委员会准备提出的意见书就是按照这些意见编写的。
