The fruits of democratic reform
    ——A Record of Changes in the Tiepenggang Residents Committee of Lhasa
    By our reporter Jing Jiadong
    The victory of the democratic reform in Tibet has brought a new life to urban residents. The changes in the Tiepenggang Residents Committee in the Eastern District of Lhasa fully illustrate this point.
    One rainy day, we arrived at the Tiepenggang Residents Committee. The committee members were in a meeting, discussing how the residents of the street could use manpower, materials, and technology to support the peasants in welcoming the first harvest year after the democratic reform.
    Committee member Quden Zhuoma, in order to illustrate the changes in this residents committee, first introduced the situation under the past serf system. She said: "Tiepenggang, like other residential areas in the city, used to be filled with filth, hunger, and darkness. Most of the more than 500 households were semi-unemployed handicraft workers, small vendors, and laborers. In addition, there were 45 households selling wine, 10 households smoking and selling opium, 12 gambling dens, 6 prostitutes, and more than 100 thieves and beggars. At that time, there were quarrels and fights every day, and young women were afraid to go out after dark."
    Then she excitedly described the current situation: "After the democratic reform, every resident of the street has their own job, every adult participates in production, and every household has income."
    The entire residents committee has fifteen trades, including ironwork, transportation, textiles, sewing, leather making, glue boiling, and shoemaking, as well as twenty-eight mutual aid groups. There are more than 800 handicraft workers, and in the first half of this year, they produced agricultural tools and various products worth approximately 100,000 yuan, supplying the needs of urban and rural people, turning this residential area from consumption to production.
    In this residents committee, all the former vagrants and idlers have jobs. In addition, twenty-four homeless elderly and disabled people were sent to the Lhasa Municipal Shelter, and more than a dozen orphans entered the No. 3 Public Primary School. In the Highland Textile Production Mutual Aid Group, fifty-five women are peacefully pedaling wool spinning machines, spinning yarn. Most of them used to be beggars. Since the establishment of the mutual aid group in October last year, production has been continuously increasing, and income has gradually increased. They have improved from hand-twisting wool yarn to using foot-operated wool spinning machines, becoming a Red Flag Production Mutual Aid Group. The All-China Women's Federation also presented them with a banner.
    Drunken brawls and gambling have disappeared here, and new social customs have replaced the past fights and animosity. The production mutual aid groups have become units of friendship and unity. The members take care of each other and help each other. During festivals, everyone goes to the Linka for picnics together, and if anyone has difficulties, they cooperate to solve them. For example, when the residents committee's private primary school was carrying out work-study programs, the glue-boiling mutual aid group took the initiative to send veteran workers to teach students glue-boiling techniques; when members of the iron and wood mutual aid group heard that the textile mutual aid group was going to carry out technical reforms, they worked overnight to help rush-manufacture more than ten foot-operated wool spinning machines and sent them over.
    Studying culture has become a common demand of the residents. Almost all school-age children in the entire residents committee have entered private and public primary schools, and many illiterate adults have entered night schools. Reading groups and study groups have been established in various production mutual aid groups to study the Party's policies and guidelines and current affairs.
    Women are demanding to be liberated from tedious housework. At the initiative of some mothers, this residents committee recently opened a daycare center, and more than sixty children were sent there at once. Some members of the mutual aid groups have also voluntarily set up collective meals. Since their establishment, under the leadership and help of the Party and the People's Government, the production of various mutual aid groups has continued to develop, and the socialist consciousness of the workers has been greatly improved, providing a prerequisite for the socialist transformation of handicrafts. The first handicraft production cooperative on the Tibetan Plateau, the "July 1st" Iron and Wood Production Cooperative, began to be established first in this residents committee.

    民主改革的果实
    ——记拉萨铁朋岗居民委员会的变化
    本报记者　景家栋
    西藏民主改革的胜利给城市居民带来了新的生活，拉萨市东城区铁朋岗居民委员会的变化，充分说明了这一点。
    一个阴雨天，我们来到了铁朋岗居民委员会，委员们正在开会，研究街道居民怎样用人力、物力和技术支援农民们迎接民主改革后的第一个丰收年。
    委员曲登卓玛为了说明这个居民委员会的变化，首先介绍了过去在农奴制度下的情况。她说：“铁朋岗和市区其他的居民区一样，过去充满着肮脏、饥饿和黑暗，五百多户居民中多半是半失业的手工业工人、小摊贩和小工，另外有卖酒的四十五户，吸卖鸦片的十户，赌场十二户，娼妓六户，小偷、乞丐一百多人，那时候，每天要发生汹酒、打架的事情，青年妇女天一黑就不敢出门。”
    接着她兴奋地讲述着现在的情况：“民主改革后，街道居民每个人都有了自己的工作，成年人个个参加生产，户户都有收入。”
    整个居民委员会共有铁工、运输、纺织、缝纫、制革、熬胶和做鞋等十五个行业，二十八个互助组，手工业的工人有八百多人，今年上半年生产了价值约十万元的农具和各种产品，供应城乡人民的需要，使这个居民区由消费变为面向生产。
    在这个居民委员会里，所有过去的流浪者和不务正业的人都有了工作。另外有二十四个流落街头的孤老和残废送入了拉萨市收容院，十几个孤儿进了公立第三小学。在高原纺织生产互助组里，五十五位妇女安详地踏着毛纺机在纺织，她们都是半劳动力，过去多是乞丐。从去年10月成立互助组以来，生产不断上升，收入逐渐增加，由手工捻毛线改进到用脚踏纺毛机，成为红旗生产互助组，全国妇女联合会还赠给她们一面锦旗。
    汹酒、赌博在这里已经绝迹，新的社会风尚代替了过去的打架和仇视。生产互助组成了友爱团结的单位，组员们互相照顾互相帮助，节日里大家集体到林卡游园，谁有困难就进行协作解决。例如居民委员会的民办小学在开展勤工俭学时，熬胶互助组主动派出老工人教学生熬胶技术；铁木互助组的组员听说纺织互助组要进行技术改革，就连夜帮助赶造十多部脚踏毛纺车送去。
    学习文化成了居民的普遍要求，整个居民委员会的学龄儿童，几乎全部入了民办小学和公立小学，许多不识字的成年人入了夜校，各个生产互助组都成立了读报小组和学习小组，学习党的政策方针和时事。
    妇女们要求从繁琐的家务中解放出来，在一些母亲的倡议下，最近这个居民委员会办了一座日间托儿所，一下子就送来了六十多个小孩。有些互助组的组员还自动办了集体伙食。各个互助组从成立以来，在党和人民政府的领导帮助下，生产不断有所发展，工人的社会主义觉悟大大提高，为手工业的社会主义改造提供了前提。西藏高原上第一个手工业生产合作社——“七一”铁木生产合作社，首先在这个居民委员会开始建立。
