    “The Honors Brought by New Commune Members”
    During the busy "Three Autumns" season, the enthusiastic leadership of the new commune members has brought a new atmosphere to our area. The new members are either workers or staff from commune-run factories, or family members of cadres. They came to the farm in active response to the Party's call to "vigorously develop agriculture and vigorously develop grain production," adding new strength to our farm. Zhao Huaiqin, a cadre's family member, said, "As the saying goes, 'If farming is unsuccessful, nothing else will succeed.' I am determined to listen to the Party, learn farm work, cultivate the land well, and work in the countryside for the rest of my life." On her first day of production, she got up before dawn to plow the land, exceeding her quota and doing a good job.
    During the "Three Autumns" work, the new and old commune members launched a friendly competition, pushing all kinds of farm work to the forefront. As a result, our farm was named an "Advanced Farm," and everyone said: This is the honor brought by the new commune members.

    “新社员带来的荣誉”
    在“三秋”大忙中，由于新参加农场的社员积极带头劳动，使我们这里充满了一片新的气象。新来的社员有的是社办工厂的工人或职工，有的是干部家属。他们是积极响应党的“大办农业、大办粮食”的号召来到农场的，他们给我们农场添了新的力量。干部家属赵慧琴说：“常言说，‘种地不成，百事不通’我坚决听党的话，学会农活，种好地，在农村里干一辈子。”她参加生产的第一天，天刚亮就起床去翻地，超额完成了任务，干活质量也好。
    在“三秋”工作中，新老社员开展了友谊竞赛，使样样农活都走在前头，因此，我们农场被评为“上游农场”，大家都说：这是新社员带来的荣誉。
