    Plant Winter Vegetables as Much as Possible; Harvest Autumn Vegetables in Time
    Guangxi and Sichuan Seize the Opportunity to Expand the Planting of Winter Vegetables; Heilongjiang and Qinghai Organize the Masses to Harvest and Store Autumn Vegetables

    (Our newspaper Nanning dispatch of 21st) Guangxi, from rural areas to cities, from communes to government offices, enterprises, and schools, is mobilizing everyone to plant vegetables on a large scale.

    Guangxi's winter vegetables, with their many varieties and high yields, have always been the most important season for vegetable production throughout the year. While focusing on grain production, Party committees at all levels attach great importance to vegetable production, listing the large-scale planting of vegetables as an important component of this year's winter planting plan. The entire autonomous region plans to dedicate approximately one-tenth of the winter planting land specifically to vegetable cultivation. It is also stipulated that all canteens without established vegetable bases must establish such bases. Taking advantage of the relatively less busy period before the autumn harvest, various localities have begun to seize the opportunity to launch a concentrated campaign to plant vegetables. To this end, various localities have established vegetable planting command structures at all levels, assigned dedicated cadres to strengthen leadership. Some have also held short-term training classes to strengthen technical guidance, while others have convened on-site meetings to exchange experiences in increasing production, and implemented a combination of concentrated rush planting and contracted nursing methods, rapidly launching a mass vegetable planting upsurge.

    In the large-scale planting of vegetables, various localities are employing various methods to plant as much as possible. Nandan County has adopted a method that combines collective vegetable planting as the main approach with private vegetable planting, implementing four-level planting, i.e., communes and brigades establish specialized vegetable growing teams, production team canteens plant, government offices, schools, and factories and mines plant, and commune members also plant privately, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties. They utilize scattered plots of land such as the edges of villages, houses, roads, etc., planting as many plants as possible wherever there is space. In this way, they not only occupy less large tracts of land but also expand the vegetable area. On the other hand, various localities are also vigorously promoting intercropping of grain and vegetables, as well as intercropping and relay cropping of vegetables, making multiple use of one piece of land.

    While planting vegetables on a large scale, various localities are paying close attention to strengthening care.

    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Sichuan is building upon the significant achievements in autumn vegetable production, and seizing the current favorable opportunity to widely mobilize the masses to plant winter vegetables on a large scale. Yibin Special District, under the slogan of planting an additional three fen of winter vegetables per person, is promptly transplanting the more than 50,000 mu of winter vegetable seedlings cultivated in the early stage to the vacant land that has just been harvested from the major summer crops. Longchang County mobilized more than 100,000 people at once, utilizing all vacant land and adopting methods such as crop rotation and continuous cropping of winter vegetables and autumn vegetables. In just one day, they planted more than 10,000 mu of various winter vegetables such as Swiss chard, cabbage, Chinese kohlrabi, and carrots. Other localities are also fully exploiting the land potential without affecting the production of the next year's minor spring crops, adopting direct sowing or transplanting methods to vigorously plant various winter vegetables in a race against time.

    Winter vegetable production occupies an important position in Sichuan's annual vegetable production. It not only has many varieties and high yields but also has a longer harvesting and consumption season. Fresh vegetables can generally be eaten until April and May of the following year, connecting with the spring vegetables. Therefore, all parts of the province have attached importance to winter vegetable production early on and, based on the experience that early planting of winter vegetables leads to high yields, have made every effort to cultivate a large number of vegetable seedlings. Winter vegetable land was also planned early on when planning land for minor spring crops, following the principle of overall consideration. Leading cadres at all levels also went deep into the masses to conduct inspections and promptly resolved issues such as seeds, labor, and fertilizers, creating favorable conditions for the timely and early planting and transplanting of winter vegetables.

    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) In the urban and suburban areas of major and medium-sized cities in Heilongjiang Province, efforts are being made to seize the peak season of autumn vegetables for harvesting and transportation, in order to reserve vegetables for this winter and next spring.

    This year, various parts of Heilongjiang Province have widely utilized idle land and gaps to plant more vegetables, and have also replanted a season of autumn vegetables on land that has been harvested from wheat and flax. The area for autumn vegetables has been expanded, and the autumn vegetables in most areas are growing well. In order to harvest all the vegetables in a timely manner, various localities have arranged a certain amount of manpower and transportation tools to harvest and transport vegetables while harvesting major autumn crops. Harbin City and its surrounding suburban areas mobilized a total of 200,000 people to pull, stack, and sort as they go, inspecting each plot as they harvest, improving the quality of the vegetable harvest. All government offices, enterprises, troops, schools, and collective dining units in the city are linked to the management areas and production teams of the people's communes, going to the production areas to harvest and transport vegetables. In order to harvest all 45,000 mu of autumn vegetables in the city, without losing a single leaf, the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, Jia Zhang, led more than 270 cadres to go deep into the management areas and production teams, assuming responsibility at each level, and working with the masses to plan a detailed harvest.

    Various effective measures have also been taken throughout the province to do a good job in storing vegetables.

    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Autumn vegetables in Qinghai Province have matured, and people's communes and government organizations are actively carrying out harvesting and storage work. According to extremely incomplete statistics, the province has currently stored more than 202 million jin of various vegetables.

    Qinghai Province has a short vegetable production season, and vegetables in winter and spring mainly rely on storage methods to solve the problem, so large-scale planting of autumn vegetables and processing and storage are of great significance. Now, some people's communes in Xining, Minhe, Ledu, Tianhe and other counties and cities have achieved the requirement of storing 1,000 jin of vegetables per person. Sihe Brigade of Gandu Commune in Hualong Hui Autonomous County adopted a method combining centralized storage by production teams and storage by commune member families in the process of storing vegetables. Now, the corridors of every household are full of vegetables, the courtyards are full of dried vegetables, and vegetable cellars and pits are also full of a large amount of pickled and fresh vegetables.

    Commercial departments throughout the province have also vigorously carried out the purchase and storage of vegetables. The rebuilt and expanded vegetable pits and cellars of the Xining Municipal Bureau of Commerce have increased by nearly 50% compared with last year.

    The planting area of autumn vegetables in Qinghai Province this year has increased by more than two times compared with last year. Many people's communes and government units have achieved the requirement of planting an average of three, four, or five fen of vegetables per person.

    冬菜尽量多种　秋菜适时收好
    广西四川抓时机扩种冬季蔬菜  黑龙江青海组织群众收贮秋菜
    本报南宁21日电　广西从农村到城市，从公社到机关、企业、学校，全民动手，大种蔬菜。
    广西的冬季蔬菜，品种多，产量高，向来是全年蔬菜生产最重要的一季。各级党委在大抓粮食生产的同时，极为重视蔬菜生产，把大种蔬菜列为今年冬种计划的一个重要组成部分，全自治区计划以大约十分之一的冬种田，专门种菜。并且规定凡没有建立蔬菜基地的食堂，都要建立起蔬菜基地。在这秋收前农事稍闲的时机，各地已经开始抢先突击种菜。为此，各地层层设立了种菜指挥机构，固定了干部加强领导。有的还举行短期训练班，加强技术指导，有的召开现场会议，交流增产经验，并且实行突击抢种与包工护理相结合的办法，迅速地掀起了全民种菜高潮。
    各地在大种蔬菜中，运用各种办法，尽量多种。南丹县采取以集体种菜为主，集体种菜与私人种菜相结合的办法，实行四级种菜，即公社和大队建立种菜专业队，小队食堂种，机关、学校、厂矿种，社员私人也种，充分调动了各方面的积极性。他们利用村边、屋边、路边等“十边”零星地，见缝插针，能多种几株就多种几株。这样，既少占用大片田地，又扩大了蔬菜面积。另方面，各地还大搞粮菜混种和蔬菜间种、套种，一地多用。
    各地在大种蔬菜的同时，十分注意加强护理。
    据新华社讯　四川各地在秋菜生产取得显著成绩的基础上，又抓紧当前有利时机，广泛发动群众大种冬菜。宜宾专区在每人增种三分冬菜的口号下，将前期培育的五万多亩冬菜苗及时移栽到刚收获过的大春作物空闲地里。隆昌县一次出动十万多人，利用一切空田空土和采取冬菜与秋菜轮作、连作等办法，仅一天时间，就栽种了一万多亩牛皮菜、莲花白、大头菜、胡萝卜等各种冬菜。其它各地也在不影响明年小春生产的前提下，充分挖掘土地潜力，采取直播或移栽的办法，大力抢栽各种冬菜。
    冬菜生产在四川全年的蔬菜生产中，占有重要地位。它不仅品种多，产量高，同时收获食用的季节也较长，鲜菜一般可吃到明年4、5月，接上春菜。因此，全省各地都及早重视了冬菜生产，并根据冬菜早栽高产的经验。在大种秋菜的同时，就千方百计培育了大批的菜苗。冬菜用地，也在规划小春作物用地时，按照统筹兼顾的原则，及早作了规划。各级领导干部也深入群众进行检查，并及时解决了种子、劳力、肥料等问题，及早为冬菜的适时早栽早移工作，创造了良好的条件。
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省各大、中城市的市区和郊区抓紧秋菜旺季抢收抢运，为今冬明春储备蔬菜。
    今年黑龙江省各地广泛利用闲田隙地多种蔬菜，并且利用收过小麦和亚麻的地复种一季秋菜，秋菜面积扩大，多数地区的秋菜长得很好。为了把蔬菜全部适时地收回来，各地在收割大秋作物的同时，都安排了一定的人力和运输工具收运蔬菜。哈尔滨市和所属郊区共出动了二十万人，随拔、随垛、随拣，收一块检查一块，提高了蔬菜收获质量。全市各机关、企业、部队、学校和集体伙食单位，都和人民公社的管理区、生产队挂钩，到产地收菜运菜。牡丹江市为了把全市四万五千多亩秋菜棵叶不丢地全部收回来，由市委书记贾樟带领二百七十多名干部，分别深入到各管理区和生产队，层层包干，和群众一起共谋细收大计。
    全省各地还采取各种有效办法，作好蔬菜贮藏工作。
    据新华社讯　青海省的秋菜已经成熟，各人民公社和机关团体正在积极进行收获和贮存工作。据极不完全统计，全省目前已贮存各种蔬菜两亿零二千多万斤。
    青海省的蔬菜生产季节较短，冬春两季的蔬菜主要依靠贮存的方法来解决，因而大种秋菜和加工贮备有十分重要的意义。现在，西宁、民和、乐都、天河等县市的一些人民公社，已经做到每人贮菜千斤的要求。化隆回族自治县甘都公社四合大队在贮菜过程中，采取了生产队集中贮存和社员家庭贮存相结合的办法，现在社员家家户户走廊挂满菜，院庭晒满菜，菜池、菜窖也储满了大量的腌菜、鲜菜。
    全省各地商业部门也大力开展了蔬菜的收购和贮备工作。西宁市商业局改建和扩建的菜池、菜窖，比去年增加将近50％。
    青海省今年秋菜的种植面积比去年增长两倍多，许多人民公社和机关单位实现了平均每人种菜三分、四分或五分地的要求。
