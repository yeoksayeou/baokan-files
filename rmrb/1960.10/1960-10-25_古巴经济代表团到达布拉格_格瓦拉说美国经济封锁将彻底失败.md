Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 24th. The Cuban Revolutionary Government economic delegation, led by the President of the National Bank of Cuba, Guevara, arrived in Prague yesterday. The delegation will be visiting here for four days and will hold talks with the Czechoslovak government on expanding cooperation and technical assistance between the two countries.

Those who went to the airport to welcome the delegation included the Czechoslovak Minister of Foreign Trade, Krajcir, Minister Frlna, and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hajek, among others. Upon arriving in Prague, the head of the Cuban economic delegation, Guevara, told a Czechoslovak News Agency reporter that the delegation's visit to Czechoslovakia "is to discuss the details of the 1961 economic agreements signed by Cuba with some socialist countries."

He said: Currently, the United States is launching a full-scale offensive against the Cuban revolution. Although American "economic aggression has caused us a certain degree of difficulty, in the future the United States will suffer the consequences of its own actions." He said that thanks to the help of friendly countries, Cuba is taking important measures to develop its national economy. This help is not attached to any economic or political conditions.

Guevara said: "We are deeply convinced that the US blockade against our country will utterly fail. In this way, Cuba will become a living example for other Latin American countries in their struggle for further free development."
