    A Machine Tractor Station
    Completes the Second Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 20th - According to the Albanian Telegraph Agency, the Albanian machine tractor stations have victoriously fulfilled their guarantee to complete the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) ahead of schedule. From January 1956 to the beginning of October this year, they completed the cultivation of 3,603,000 hectares of land, which is 76,000 hectares more than the task stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan, equivalent to 5.5 times that of the First Five-Year Plan. At present, more than 80% of the cultivated land and more than 50% of the sowing work in Albanian agriculture are carried out by machines from machine tractor stations.
    During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the machine tractor stations also achieved good results in other aspects of their work. Labor consumption was reduced by 34.5%, while the original target was 20%, thus saving the state millions of leks (currency name) in funds. The machine tractor stations also helped farmers complete seasonal work in a timely and good manner.
    During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the machine tractor stations also newly cultivated a total of more than 53,000 hectares of cultivated land and vineyards.

    阿机器拖拉机站
    提前完成第二个五年计划
    新华社地拉那20日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚机器拖拉机站已经胜利地实现了它们提出的提前完成第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）的保证。从1956年1月到今年10月初，它们完成了三百六十万零三千公顷土地的耕作任务，即比第二个五年计划所规定的任务多七万六千公顷，相当于第一个五年计划的五点五倍。现在，阿尔巴尼亚农业中80％以上的耕地工作和50％以上的播种工作是由机器拖拉机站的机器来进行的。
    在第二个五年计划期间，机器拖拉机站在其他方面的工作也取得了良好的成绩。劳动力的耗费降低34.5％，而原来规定的指标是20％，这样就为国家节约了数百万列克（币名）的资金。机器拖拉机站还帮助农民适时地和很好地完成季节性工作。
    在第二个五年计划期间，机器拖拉机站还新开辟了总共五万三千多公顷的耕地和葡萄园。
