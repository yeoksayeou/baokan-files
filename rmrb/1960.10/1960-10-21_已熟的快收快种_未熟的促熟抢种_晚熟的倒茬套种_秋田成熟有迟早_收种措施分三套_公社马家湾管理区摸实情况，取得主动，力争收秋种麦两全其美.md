Harvest Ripe Crops Quickly, Promote Ripening and Rush Planting for Unripe Crops, Implement Relay Planting for Late-Maturing Crops
Autumn Fields Mature at Different Times, Three Sets of Harvesting and Planting Measures are Adopted
People's Commune Ma Jiawan Management District Grasps the Actual Situation, Takes the Initiative, and Strives to Achieve a Win-Win Situation for Both Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting

(Reported by our newspaper) Qiao Xinglong, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Ma Jiawan Management District of Gaoling People's Commune in Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province, went deep among the masses, humbly learned from experienced farmers and technicians, and jointly ascertained the different maturity conditions of various autumn fields and cotton fields. They adopted different measures to solve the contradiction between early planting of returning wheat and the inability of autumn grain and cotton to mature early and vacate fields, thereby accelerating the planting progress of returning wheat.

This year, the Ma Jiawan Management District plans to plant more than 8,100 mu of wheat, of which only 200 mu are direct-seeded, and the rest are returning wheat. The current situation is that some late autumn crops and cotton, due to late planting dates and unfavorable weather conditions, cannot be harvested on time, which affects the progress of wheat planting. The commune members have three attitudes and opinions on this issue. Some people believe that returning wheat should be planted early, and cotton and autumn grain should be harvested earlier, and the loss of a little yield is not a big deal. The second group of people are just the opposite. They do not attach importance to early planting of returning wheat and hold a passive attitude of unified harvesting and planting whenever the previous crop matures. The third group is the majority of commune members, who advocate not bowing to difficulties, wanting to grow returning wheat well, and not affecting the yield of cotton and autumn grain. The Management District Party Committee completely agreed with the latter view and led the masses to calculate two accounts together. One account is that regardless of the specific maturity of the previous crop, if they harvested and planted wheat, assuming a loss of five jin of ginned cotton per mu of cotton and a loss of twenty jin of yield per mu of corn, the entire management district would lose more than 20,000 jin of ginned cotton and more than 100,000 jin of corn. The other account is that if they did not rush to plant returning wheat early and missed the season, they would lose thirty jin of wheat per mu, and the entire management district would lose 200,000 jin of wheat. Through accounting and various aspects of education, the broad masses of commune members realized that they must establish the correct concept of "the more the better" for both autumn harvest and autumn planting, and they cannot lose autumn grain for the sake of wheat, nor can they only care about autumn grain and affect wheat.

Comrade Qiao Xinglong, Secretary of the Management District Party Committee, together with experienced farmers, technicians, and team cadres, discussed ways to harvest autumn crops well and plant wheat well in the Mijia Cliff Production Team. They checked, watched, and discussed together, and found that the early corn that had already turned yellow and full of kernels, and some cotton with catkins on the original land and along the banks, only accounted for 30% of the total area of ​​autumn grain and cotton fields in the entire team. These more than 900 mu of land can be immediately harvested, cleared, and planted with wheat. The problem is that 50% of the cotton has only about half of its catkins, and more than half of the corn is also in the process of rising in face and full grains. These plots will still need ten to half a month to harvest, which is the main focus of the contradiction between the two crops. Comrade Qiao Xinglong asked everyone to focus on solving the problem of wheat planting in these plots and offer suggestions. The commune members of the Ma Jiawan Team said that in previous years, their practice of digging up some eight or nine mature corn stalks with roots and piling them on the edge of the field not only did not affect the yield but also increased production. They suggested that this year, this method of pulling stalks to promote ripening should also be adopted in order to vacate the land for wheat planting early. Technicians and commune members of the Dianziwang Village Youth Farm introduced that the cotton in the farm that had been pushed to merge rows and ridges entered the peak catkin period five or six days earlier than the cotton that had not been pushed to merge rows and ridges. The flowers bloom quickly, and the quality is also good; combining picking flowers and stepping on the rows can also promote early ripening of cotton. However, in the field observation, there are still more than 10% of the late autumn crops and cotton, and if general measures to promote early ripening are adopted, they will definitely not catch up with the season. What should be done? Comrade Qiao Xinglong discussed with the commune members for a long time, and finally found a proper solution from several plans. That is to change the cultivation plan for more than 200 mu of early corn land that the team originally planned to reserve for cotton fields next year, not to plant cotton, but to plant wheat, and to continue planting cotton on the cotton land that was newly planted last year and matured too late for another year. In this way, once the stubble is switched, the cotton field area will not be reduced, and the wheat planting time can be advanced. As for the few old cotton fields that need to be stubbled, they are planted last. At the beginning, while planting early-maturing land, they repeatedly push the stalks together, pick old leaves, and top the corn on these cotton and corn fields, constantly promoting early ripening, so that the land can be vacated for planting before the frost falls.

Comrade Qiao Xinglong, through dissecting "sparrows" in the Mijia Cliff Production Team, conducting investigations and research, and returning to the Management District, collectively studied the situation in various places with the Party Committee, and decided to promote these measures to the other two production teams. According to the three different types of crops, three principles were formulated for harvesting autumn crops well and planting wheat well: 1. The cotton and autumn crops that have already matured must be harvested before planting; 2. If the delay in maturity is not long, try to promote early maturity as much as possible, and if necessary, pull the stalks and rush to plant when they are eight or nine mature; 3. For some cotton and late autumn crops that mature too late, adopt the method of relay planting. Several leading cadres of the Management District also divided the work and contracted to the three production teams, strengthened the leadership of autumn harvest and autumn planting, and the planting progress of returning wheat began to accelerate. The Liang Village Production Team originally had 600 mu of millet land planned to be reserved for cotton fields, but these millets matured early, while the corn land planned to plant wheat matured late. They revised the planting plan, reversed the stubble again, and planted wheat on time. The Mijia Cliff and Chenjiatan Production Teams adopted methods such as planting while promoting early maturity and harvesting in the morning and planting in the afternoon to accelerate the daily progress of planting returning wheat. Now, it has entered the tense stage of rushing to plant winter wheat. (Attached picture)

In the autumn harvest, the commune members of the North Zhang Fort Production Team of the Five-Story Management District of the Five-Star People's Commune in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, promptly put the corn harvested that day on the shelves.

    已熟的快收快种　未熟的促熟抢种　晚熟的倒茬套种
    秋田成熟有迟早  收种措施分三套
    公社马家湾管理区摸实情况，取得主动，力争收秋种麦两全其美
    本报讯　陕西三原县高陵公社马家湾管理区党委书记乔兴隆，深入群众，虚心向老农、技术员学习，共同摸清了各类秋田、棉田成熟的不同情况，分别采取不同的措施，解决了早种回茬麦和秋粮、棉花不能早熟的争地腾茬矛盾，加快了回茬麦的播种进度。
    马家湾管理区今年计划种小麦八千一百多亩，除二百亩是正茬，其余都是回茬。当前的情况是：有一部分晚秋和棉花，因播种期晚、气候不好等原因，前茬不能按时收获，影响种麦进度。社员群众对这个问题有三种态度和主张，一部分人认为回茬麦要种早，棉花、秋粮提早收，损失点产量关系不大。第二种人恰恰相反，他们不重视早种回茬麦，抱着啥时前茬熟了，啥时统收统种的消极态度。第三种是绝大多数社员的主张，不向困难低头，既要种好回茬麦，又不影响棉花和秋粮的产量。管理区党委和后一种看法完全一致，领导群众一起算了两笔账。一笔是不管前茬成熟的具体情况收了种麦，以每亩棉花少收五斤皮棉和每亩玉米少收二十斤产量计算，全管区就要少收二万多斤皮棉和十万多斤玉米；另一笔是如果不抢时早种回茬麦，误了节令，每亩少收三十斤小麦，全管区就要少收二十万斤小麦。通过算账和各方面的教育，使广大社员认识到一定要树立秋收、秋种两个“多多益善”的正确观念，不能抓了小麦损失秋粮，也不能只顾秋粮影响小麦。
    管理区党委书记乔兴隆同志在米家崖生产队，和老农、技术员、社干部一起商量既收好秋、又种好麦的办法。他们边查、边看、边议，发现这里已经壳黄颗饱的早玉米，有些原上、岸畔吐絮的棉花，只占全队秋粮、棉田总面积的30％。这类地有九百多亩，是可以马上抢收、腾茬、种麦的。问题就是有50％的棉花吐絮仅一半左右，一半多的玉米也正在升面饱粒，这些地块都还需要十天至半个月时间才能收获，这就是两料庄稼矛盾的主要焦点。乔兴隆同志就请大家集中解决这类地块的种麦问题献计献策。马家湾小队的社员说，往年他们把一些八、九成熟玉米连棒带根挖下来拥在地头的作法，不仅没有影响产量，还增了产。他们建议今年也采用这种拔秆促熟办法，以便提早腾地种麦。店子王村青年农场技术员和社员们介绍，农场的棉花已经推株并垅的比没有推株并垅的早五、六天进入吐絮盛期，花开的快，质量还好；结合摘花踏行子，也能起到促进棉花早熟的作用。但是，在田间观察，还有10％多的一部分晚秋和棉花，采取一般的促进早熟措施，肯定是赶不上节令了，这怎么办呢？乔兴隆同志和社员们商议了半天，最后才从好几个方案中，找到了一条妥善的办法。这就是把队里原来规划留作明年棉田的早玉米地二百多亩，改变耕作计划，不种棉花，种上小麦，而把去年新倒茬、成熟过迟的棉地继续再种一年棉花，这样茬口一倒换，棉田面积并不减少，种麦时间可以提前了。至于少数需要倒茬的老棉田，他们是放在最后种，开始一面种早熟地，一面对这类棉地和玉米地，反复进行推株并垅、摘老叶和给玉米削顶尖，不断促进早熟，使赶霜降前能腾出地来播种。
    乔兴隆同志通过在米家崖生产队解剖“麻雀”、调查研究，返回管理区又和党委集体研究了各地情况，决定向其他两个生产队推广这些措施。根据作物三类不同的情况，制订了收好秋、种好麦的三项原则：一、已经成熟的棉、秋作物，坚决收后再种；二、推迟成熟期不多，尽量促进早熟，必要时八、九成熟拔秆抢种；三、一部分成熟实在太晚的棉花和晚秋，采取倒茬套种的办法。管理区几个领导干部并分工包干三个生产队，加强了秋收、秋种领导，回茬麦的播种进度就开始加快。梁村生产队原有六百亩谷子地计划预留棉田，但这些谷子成熟早，而规划种小麦的玉米地却成熟迟，他们就修改播种计划，重新倒了茬口，按时种上了小麦。米家崖和陈家滩生产队都采取了边播种、边促早熟，上午收下午种等办法，加速了播种回茬麦的日进度。现在，这里已进入抢种冬麦的紧张阶段。（附图片）
