    Joyfully Picking New Cotton
    Cotton bolls are bursting, silvery blossoms are opening, and the broad masses of cotton farmers are joyfully picking new cotton.
    Cotton should be picked in a timely and meticulous manner. Cotton bolls mature at different times and fluff at different rates. Only by picking as they ripen can we reduce losses and improve quality.
    The cotton of the Happiness Brigade of the Gangkou People's Commune in Jiujiang City, Jiangxi Province, is now massively fluffing.

    喜摘新棉
    棉桃爆裂，银花开放，广大棉农正在喜摘新棉。
    采摘棉花要及时，要细致；棉桃陆续成熟，吐絮时间不一，只有边熟边收，才能减少损失，提高质量。
    江西九江市港口人民公社幸福大队的棉花，现已大量吐絮。
