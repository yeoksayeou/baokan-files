Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch from Belgrade: After returning home from attending the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Yugoslav President Tito delivered a speech at a mass rally in Belgrade on the 12th.

In his speech, Tito attempted to pat his chest and feign impartiality, saying that Yugoslavia's "position" on the disarmament issue was "beyond reproach." He said Yugoslavia "fully supported" the Soviet Union's position, "because that is also our position." However, everyone knows that when the United States manipulated the voting machine at the UN to reject the Soviet proposal to have the UN General Assembly directly discuss the disarmament issue, and instead passed the US proposal, handled through the General Affairs Committee, to hand the disarmament issue over to the Political Committee for discussion, the Yugoslav delegation led by Tito did not actively support the Soviet proposal, but instead "abstained."

In Tito's speech, there was not a single word criticizing the United States for refusing to allow the General Assembly to discuss the disarmament issue. Instead, he indiscriminately attacked all major powers, saying that "major powers basically still speak from a position of strength." In Tito's view, the United States had not pursued a Cold War policy, so he actually wanted to find "protagonists of the Cold War" among socialist countries and neutral nations. Tito said that he "did not spare labor at the United Nations General Assembly" and "held as many meetings as possible with leaders from the three sides of countries (Xinhua editor's note: here refers to socialist countries, Asian-African neutral countries, and imperialist countries)," "in order to clearly understand and see where the forces playing the protagonists of the Cold War are hiding."

But in his diligent "labor," Tito still did not "understand and see" that the United States was a "protagonist of the Cold War," and he did not even consider the incident of the United States dispatching U-2 planes to invade the Soviet Union as an act of the "Cold War." As everyone knows, when the UN General Assembly voted on the Soviet proposal to discuss the issue of American spy planes invading Soviet airspace at a plenary session of the General Assembly, the Yugoslav delegation abstained.

    回贝尔格莱德后谈在联大活动
    铁托当了帮凶还装“公道”
    对苏联建议投弃权票还说是“全面支持”苏联
    竟在社会主义国家和中立国中找“冷战主角”
    新华社15日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫总统铁托在出席联合国大会第十五届会议回国后，12日在贝尔格莱德群众大会上发表了演说。
    铁托在演说中企图拍拍胸膛装公道，说什么南斯拉夫在裁军问题上的“立场”是“任何人也不能责备的”。他说南斯拉夫“全面支持”苏联的立场，“因为那也就是我们的立场”。但是人们都知道，当美国在联大操纵表决机器否决苏联要求联合国大会直接讨论裁军问题的建议，而通过美国假手总务委员会提出的关于把裁军问题交给政治委员会讨论的提案时，铁托所率领的南斯拉夫代表团并没有积极地支持苏联的建议，而是“弃权”。
    在铁托的演说中不但没有一个字指责美国拒绝大会讨论裁军问题，而且不分青红皂白攻击一切大国、说什么“大国基本上还是以实力地位讲话的”。在铁托看来，美国并没有奉行冷战政策，因此他竟然要在社会主义国家和中立国家中去寻找“冷战主角”。铁托说，他“在联合国大会上并没有吝惜劳动”，并“尽可能多地同三个方面的国家（新华社编者按：此处系指社会主义国家、亚非中立国家和帝国主义国家）领导人会谈”，“以便清楚地了解和看到扮演冷战主角的势力究竟藏在那里”。
    但铁托在他的辛勤“劳动”中还是没有“了解和看到”美国是“冷战主角”，连美国派遣U—2飞机侵略苏联的事件他都不认为是“冷战”行为。众所周知，在联大表决苏联提出的在大会全体会议上讨论美国间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空的建议时，南斯拉夫代表团却弃权了。
