	Eradicate Third-Class Wheat Seedlings in the Initial Stages

	The communes of Baodi County, Hebei Province, while rushing to plant wheat, are strengthening the management of early-sown wheat seedlings to resolutely eliminate third-class seedlings in the initial stages.

	Baodi County has progressed quickly and with high quality in wheat planting this year. As of October 3rd, the county had planted 500,000 mu of wheat, and now more than 200,000 mu of wheat have emerged, basically achieving full and strong seedlings. However, due to the many late-autumn crops this year, much of the wheat is interplanted, plowed shallowly, and prone to crusting after rain; most wheat fields were sown while seizing moisture, and some alkaline land is threatened by pests such as mole crickets and autumn locusts. To ensure that every ridge has full seedlings and every plant is robust, the Baodi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party mobilized the masses to grasp the management of wheat seedlings early while rushing to plant wheat.

	Vigorously Improve Saline-Alkaline Land to Strive for High Summer Grain Yields

	Wuyou Commune in Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, is vigorously transforming saline-alkaline land during the autumn sowing season, striving for large-scale high yields and abundant harvests of summer-ripening crops next year. Before liberation, most of the cultivated land in Wuyou Commune was saline-alkaline soil. After liberation, it was transformed year by year. Especially after the people's communes were established, 70% of the commune's saline-alkaline land has been transformed into good fields. However, there are still nearly 30,000 mu of saline-alkaline land in the commune that have not been completely transformed.

	Currently, on the 18,700 mu of heavily alkaline soil and 9,700 mu of mottled alkaline soil in the commune, a portion of organic base fertilizer has been accumulated, 7,400 alkaline drainage ditches have been opened; more than 4,470 mu of soil have been replaced; all alkaline fields have been plowed twice and are currently being plowed for the third time, and more than 560,000 jin of alkali-resistant improved varieties have been selected.

	Don't Let a Single Mu of Stubble Land Overwinter

	The people's communes in Minhe County, Qinghai Province, following the spirit of "early is a hundred times early," while concentrating their main efforts on autumn harvesting, have transferred more than 12,000 laborers and 8,000 head of draft animals to implement a method of dividing tasks by line, people by shift, and shift racing shift, ring within ring, carrying out autumn harvesting while simultaneously plowing and eliminating stubble, not allowing a single mu of stubble land to overwinter. As of the end of September, the county had already autumn-plowed more than 90% of the area that should be plowed for field crops, of which the deep-plowed area reached more than 85,000 mu, and base fertilizer was applied to more than 10,000 mu of land.

	Move Cattle Pens Uphill to Collect Base Fertilizer for Winter Planting

	Fenghuang County, Hunan Province, is adopting the method of driving cattle uphill to accumulate fertilizer to ensure the base fertilizer needed to expand the area of various crops. Currently, there are more than 10,000 head of cattle uphill in the county, and since September, a considerable amount of cattle manure has been accumulated.

	After the communes in Fenghuang County organized cattle pens to move uphill, not only did the amount of concentrated fertilizer greatly increase, but the physical condition of the draft cattle also significantly improved. Among the 924 head of draft cattle in Shanjiang Commune, more than 100 were weak and thin third-class cattle. After a month uphill, these cattle all grew fat and strong, rising to become first-class or second-class cattle.

    要闻快报
    把三类麦苗消灭在初生阶段
    河北宝坻县各公社在突击抢种小麦的同时，加强管理早播出土的麦苗，坚决把三类苗消灭在初生阶段。
    宝坻县今年种麦进度快，质量高。到十月三日，全县已种麦五十万亩，现在有二十多万亩小麦已经出土，基本做到苗全苗壮。但是，由于今年晚秋作物多，许多小麦是套种的，耕得浅，雨后有板结；大多数麦田是抢墒播种的，部分碱地还受到蝼蛄、秋蝗等虫害威胁。为了保证小麦垅垅全苗，棵棵茁壮，中共宝坻县委发动群众，在抢播麦的同时，早抓麦苗期管理。
    大改盐碱地力争夏粮高产
    江苏盐城县伍佑公社在秋种中大力改造盐碱地，力争明年夏熟作物大面积高产多收。伍佑公社在解放前绝大部分耕地都是盐碱土。解放后逐年进行改造，特别是人民公社化以后，全社百分之七十的盐碱田已改造成为好田。但是，全社还有近三万亩盐碱地没有得到彻底改造。
    目前，全社一万八千七百亩重碱土和九千七百亩花碱地，已积了一部分有机质基肥，开爽碱沟七千四百条；换土四千四百七十多亩；所有碱田全部耕完二遍，正在耕第三遍，选耐碱良种五十六万余斤。
    不让一亩板茬地过冬
    青海省民和县各人民公社，本着“一早百早”的精神，在集中主要力量进行秋收的同时，抽调了一万二千多名劳力、八千多头耕畜，实行活路分线、人分班，和班赶班、环套环的办法，一面秋收一面翻地灭茬，不让一亩板茬地过冬。截至九月底，全县已经秋翻的耕地占大田作物应翻面积的百分之九十以上，其中深翻面积达八万五千多亩，并给一万多亩地施了底肥。
    移牛栏上山赶积冬种底肥
    湖南省凤凰县采取赶牛上山积肥的办法来保证扩大各种面积所需的底肥。目前全县上山的耕牛已有一万多头，从九月份以来已积了不少牛粪。
    凤凰县各公社在组织牛栏上山以后，不仅精肥数量大大增加，耕牛体质也显著提高。山江公社的九百二十四头耕牛中有一百多头是弱瘦的三类牛，上山一个月，这些牛头头都长得膘肥体壮，上升成一类或二类牛了。
