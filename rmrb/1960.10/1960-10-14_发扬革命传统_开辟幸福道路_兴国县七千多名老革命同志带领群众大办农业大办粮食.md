    Carry Forward Revolutionary Traditions and Open Up the Road to Happiness:
    More Than 7,000 Veteran Revolutionaries in Xingguo County Lead the Masses in Vigorously Developing Agriculture and Grain Production

    (Our Dispatch) Our reporters Liu Guanghui and Zhong Xianhua report: In Xingguo County, the old revolutionary base area of Jiangxi, more than 7,000 veteran Communist Party members, Red Army soldiers, and revolutionary cadres have maintained and carried forward the Party's fine revolutionary traditions. They have taken the lead in responding to the Party's call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, working diligently and earning the love of the masses.

    Xingguo County was one of the main revolutionary base areas during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. The veteran Communist Party members, revolutionary cadres, and Red Army soldiers here not only waged unyielding struggles against the Kuomintang reactionaries before the national liberation but also consistently maintained and carried forward the revolutionary spirit of those years after the national liberation, working hard for ten years as if it were one day and leading the masses in production and construction. When the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, they immediately responded and led the masses in vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, further carrying forward the glorious tradition of the old revolutionary base areas.

    In vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, these loyal veteran comrades led the masses in actively developing agricultural production and striving to increase grain production. Lai Rupo, a member of the Jiangbei Commune Party Committee, is a veteran Red Army soldier who participated in the Long March. Recently, in order to strengthen the late-stage management of late rice, the commune party committee decided to complete three cultivations and three topdressings by mid-September and assigned Lai Rupo to the Luoguang Brigade, which had the slowest progress in cultivation and topdressing, to take responsibility for leading the brigade to complete the cultivation and topdressing tasks on schedule. After Lai Rupo arrived at this brigade, he mobilized all the brigade cadres and members to discuss how to complete the task, conducted political and ideological education for the members, helped the team reasonably arrange labor, and improved labor attendance and labor efficiency, overcoming the difficulties of having few people and much land. As a result, the entire brigade completed the tasks stipulated by the commune party committee three days ahead of schedule. Liao Dingbang, an old revolutionary cadre and secretary of the Nanmu Brigade Party Branch of Changgong Commune, in expanding the planting of double-season late rice, in order to better implement the Party's policy of planting more and harvesting more, he ran all over the brigades, villages, and fields of the entire brigade, visited more than 100 members, and finally found more than 500 mu of barren and dry land. After that, he personally led the masses to build a half-li-long large drainage ditch, solving the problem of water conservancy and irrigation. These barren and dry lands became fertile fields free from drought and waterlogging, and all were planted with double-season late rice, expanding the brigade's late rice area from 660 mu last year to 1,100 mu this year.

    Not fearing hardship and taking the lead in hard work is the noble style of the veteran comrades. In vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, wherever it was most difficult, they fought there. Lin Yunzhai, a veteran Communist Party member and deputy secretary of the Hantian Brigade Party Branch of Jiecun Commune, has led the masses in organizing mutual aid teams, establishing advanced cooperatives, and establishing people's communes for more than ten years since liberation. He always goes to the fields barefoot, takes the lead in hard work and practical work, and the masses call him "hardship secretary." Recently, while inspecting the late-stage management of late rice, Lin Yunzhai found that more than 300 mu of late rice in Niujiaolong were suffering from severe drought, and the seedlings began to wither. He immediately mobilized the members to find water sources and carry out drought resistance. The members searched for a day and a night but could not find a self-flowing water source, and some became discouraged. Lin Yunzhai then led more than ten activists to set up five waterwheels to draw water from a ditch more than ten meters down the mountain to irrigate the seedlings and insisted on not leaving the waterwheels, rushing to draw water day and night. When the members saw this fifty-year-old "hardship secretary" taking the lead in drawing water, they were greatly moved and set up more than 200 waterwheels overnight and rushed for three days, finally overcoming the drought, making the seedlings quickly transform, and preserving the harvest. Veteran Communist Party member Qiu Xingzhang said, "The older one gets, the more vigorous the revolutionary spirit becomes, and we must work hard!" He is the field manager of the Liguang Team in the Lifeng Brigade of Jiecun Commune, often challenges young people to competitions, and often wins. He is a well-known old pacesetter in the entire commune. He automatically requested to undertake the task of managing the most difficult 20 mu of three-category seedlings, insisted on fighting in the fields during the day and accompanying the seedlings at night, and carefully cultivated the seedlings. After more than a month of his skillful management and cultivation, these three types of seedlings are now growing very well.

    Like they did in the past, the veteran comrades are all diligent and thrifty, simple and unpretentious, meticulously calculating everywhere, always paying attention to saving, and trying their best to use every bit of manpower, material resources, and financial resources for vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. Lin Deqing, the first secretary of the Jiangbei Commune Party Committee, was once a Red Army company instructor, and now he still maintains the hard-working and simple style of the Red Army, never caring about his own food and clothing. Under his influence, this commune has insisted on implementing the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily. Since the establishment of the commune, no new office buildings have been built, and all cadres of the commune work diligently and produce diligently and thriftily. In early September, he went deep into the Guoyuan Brigade to help the members arrange farm work, saving 20 laborers for the brigade and strengthening the front line of agricultural production. In August, the Chengguan Commune and the Bendadi Brigade Party Branch decided to establish a livestock farm to accumulate more fertilizer to meet the needs of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. After the veteran Red Army soldier Pan Caizao learned about it, he immediately requested to take on the task of building the farm. He led more than ten members to level the rocky mountain to build the foundation, and went up the mountain to cut wood to make the roof beams. Without spending a penny, they built fifteen pigsties. After the livestock farm was established, Pan Caizao served as the director of the farm, not only raising pigs himself but also helping the breeders to feed them diligently. Now the number of pigs in the entire farm has developed to more than 300. Recently, the commune party committee held an on-site meeting of livestock production in the entire commune at the farm to promote the experience of running the farm diligently and thriftily adopted by Pan Caizao, and Pan Caizao was also named a model of livestock production in the entire commune.

    During the revolutionary war, the veteran comrades fought and lived together with the masses, cared about the lives of the masses, and safeguarded the interests of the masses. Now, although the conditions of eating and living have been greatly improved, the veteran comrades have always maintained this fine style. Liu Zongde, the captain of the Wangshantang Team of the Shuitou Brigade of Dinglong Commune, is a veteran Red Army soldier who lost his right foot in battle. In order to improve the lives of the members, he leaned on his crutches and led the cooks to go up the mountain to reclaim wasteland and sow autumn vegetables, and mobilized the cooks to raise pigs, chickens, and ducks. Now, because the canteen of this team has a solid foundation, the members eat well and are happy, and their enthusiasm for production is even higher. People describe the old comrades' concern for the masses as "looking at the kitchen when entering the door and asking about life when seeing people." They cared for the members in every possible way, often visiting the members to ask about their cold and heat, and helped solve difficulties.

    The party committees at all levels in Xingguo County care for and cherish the veteran comrades and pay attention to creating conditions from all aspects to allow the veteran comrades to fully发挥 their role. The party committees at all levels also vigorously help the veteran comrades learn politics and culture. The party schools of the county and commune have specially opened training classes for veteran cadres. More than 6,000 veteran comrades in the county have successively attended training classes to participate in political and cultural studies, further improving their political and cultural levels. In addition, the party committees at all levels often hold forums for veteran comrades to solicit their suggestions or opinions on various tasks and production. Some communes and production brigades have also organized veteran cadre advisory groups to invite veteran comrades to help study work and guide production. The Party's care has given the veteran comrades great encouragement. They said: "The Party cares for us and cherishes us. In the future, we must work better for the Party." (Attached picture)

    Hao Shucai, secretary of the general party branch of the Second Brigade of Jiaokou Town Commune in Yanchang County, Shaanxi Province, and a Red Army soldier during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, has maintained the glorious revolutionary tradition of enduring hardship before enjoying happiness since he joined the revolution. This is him sending manure to the field with the members.

    发扬革命传统　开辟幸福道路
    兴国县七千多名老革命同志带领群众大办农业大办粮食
    本报讯　记者刘光辉、钟显华报道：江西老革命根据地兴国县的七千多名老共产党员、红军战士和革命干部，保持与发扬了党的优良革命传统，带头响应党的大办农业、大办粮食的号召，埋头苦干，受到群众爱戴。
    兴国县是第二次国内革命战争时期的主要革命根据地之一。这里的老共产党员、革命干部和红军战士，不仅在全国解放前和国民党反动派进行不屈不挠的斗争，而且在全国解放后始终保持并发扬了当年的革命精神，十年如一日地艰苦奋斗，带领群众从事生产建设。当党中央和毛主席提出大办农业、大办粮食的号召后，他们又立即响应，带领群众大办农业、大办粮食，进一步发扬了老革命根据地的光荣传统。
    在大办农业、大办粮食中，这些赤胆忠心的老同志们，带领群众积极发展农业生产，争取增产更多的粮食。江背公社党委委员赖如波，是参加过长征的老红军。公社党委最近为了加强晚稻后期管理，决定在9月中旬全部完成三耘三追肥，并分配赖如波到耘田追肥进度最慢的洛光大队，包干领导该队按期完成耘田追肥任务。赖如波到这个大队后，就发动全队干部社员讨论怎样完成的办法，并且向社员们进行政治思想教育，帮助队里合理安排了劳动力，提高了劳动出勤率和劳动工效，克服了人少田多的困难。结果全队提前三天，完成了公社党委规定的任务。老革命干部、长岗公社楠木大队党支部书记廖定榜，在扩种二季晚稻中，为了更好地贯彻党的多种多收方针，他跑遍了全大队的各个小队、各个山村田段，走访了一百多名社员，终于找到了五百多亩荒田旱地。之后，他又亲自带领群众修建了一条半华里长的大水沟，解决了水利灌溉问题。这些荒田旱地变成了水旱无忧的良田，全部种上了二季晚稻，使全队晚稻面积由去年的六百六十亩，扩大到今年的一千一百亩。
    不畏艰苦，带头苦干，是老同志们的崇高风格。在大办农业、大办粮食中，那里最艰苦，他们就战斗在那里。老共产党员、杰村公社含田大队党支部副书记林云斋，解放后十多年来，他带领群众组织互助组，办高级合作社，建立人民公社，终日一双赤脚，带头下田，苦干实干，群众称他“艰苦书记”。最近林云斋在检查晚稻后期管理中，发现牛角垅有三百多亩晚稻受到严重干旱，禾苗开始枯萎。他便立即发动社员找水源开展抗旱斗争。社员们找了一天一夜，没有找到自流灌溉的水源，有的便泄了气。林云斋就带领十多个积极分子架起五台水车，从十多米的山下的一条沟里车水灌溉禾苗，并且自己日夜突击车水，坚持不下水车。社员们见到这位五十多岁的“艰苦书记”带头车水，大受感动，连夜架起二百多台水车，突击了三天，终于战胜了干旱，使禾苗迅速转变，保住了丰收。老共产党员丘兴章说：“人老革命精神振，更要好好干一场！”他是杰村公社里丰大队里光小队的田间管理员，经常向青年人挑战闹竞赛，并且常常取得胜利，是全社有名的老标兵。他自动要求担负管理最艰巨的二十亩三类苗的培育任务，坚持日战田间、夜伴禾眠，精细培育禾苗。经过他一个多月的精巧管理培育，现在这些三类禾长得很好。
    老同志们像当年一样，人人克勤克俭，个个艰苦朴素，处处精打细算，时时注意节约，尽量把每一分人力、物力、财力，都用到大办农业、大办粮食上去。江背公社党委第一书记林德庆当过老红军的连指导员，现在他仍然保持着当年红军的艰苦朴素的作风，从不计较自己的吃和穿。在他的影响下，这个公社坚持贯彻了勤俭办社的方针，自建社以来没有盖过一间新的办公楼房，全社干部都勤俭工作、勤俭生产。他在9月上旬深入到果源大队，帮助社员安排农活，使该队节约出了二十个劳力，增强了农业生产第一线。8月间，城关公社和本大队党支部决定建立一个畜牧场，以积造更多的肥料满足大办农业、大办粮食的需要。老红军潘彩藻知道后，立即要求担任建场任务。他带领十多个社员削平石山建屋基，上山伐木做屋梁，没有花一分钱，建起了十五栋猪舍。畜牧场办起来了，潘彩藻担任了场长，不仅自己亲手养猪，还帮助饲养员勤养勤喂。现在全场的猪，已发展到三百多头。最近，公社党委在该场召开了全社畜牧业生产现场会，推广潘彩藻采用的勤俭办场经验，潘彩藻还被评为全社畜牧业生产模范。
    在革命战争时期，老同志们和群众战斗在一起、生活在一起，关心群众的生活，维护群众的利益。现在，虽然吃住等各方面的条件已有很大改善，但是，这种优良的作风，老同志们一直保持着。鼎龙公社水头大队王山塘小队队长刘宗德，是位在战斗中失去了右脚的老红军，为了改善社员的生活，他扶着手杖，带领炊事员上山开荒播种秋菜，并发动炊事员饲养猪和鸡、鸭。现在，这个小队的食堂由于有了雄厚的家底，社员吃得又饱又好，个个心欢乐意，生产干劲更高。人们形容老同志关心群众是“进门看厨房，见人问生活”。他们无微不至地关怀社员，经常登门问社员的冷和热，帮助解决困难。
    兴国县各级党委十分关怀与爱护老同志，并注意从各方面创造条件，让老同志充分发挥自己的作用。各级党委还大力帮助老同志学习政治、文化。县、公社的党校都专门开设了老干部训练班，全县已有六千多名老同志先后上训练班参加了政治、文化学习，进一步提高了政治与文化水平。此外，各级党委经常召开老同志座谈会，征求他们对各项工作、生产的建议或意见。有的公社、生产大队，还组织了老干部顾问小组，请老同志帮助研究工作、指导生产。党的关怀给老同志们很大鼓舞，他们说：“党关心我们、爱护我们，今后我们一定要更好地为党工作。”（附图片）
