Spring Wheat Winter Sowing Results in Larger Ears, Plumper Grains, Earlier Maturity, and Higher Yields
Xinjiang and Qinghai Actively Expand Winter Sowing Areas

Our newspaper, Urumqi, 24th dispatch: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is actively promoting winter sowing of spring crops. The area arranged for winter sowing of spring wheat in various regions has been expanded compared to last year. In addition, spring crops such as spring barley, highland barley, peas, lentils, rapeseed, garlic, safflower, and hemp, as well as some spring vegetables, will also be partially winter-sown. Winter sowing of early spring crops is a major reform in the autonomous region's cropping system. This major reform can enable the autonomous region to harvest an extra crop each year, yielding hundreds of millions of catties more of grain and other crops, vegetables, etc. In order to ensure that this reform takes root in people's hearts, many places in the autonomous region have summarized the experience of winter sowing spring crops this year.

The experience summarized by various regions proves that winter sowing of spring crops has many benefits. First, winter-sown crops generally mature more than ten days earlier than spring-sown crops. Second, the seeds of winter-sown crops germinate and overwinter underground, allowing the seeds and ear primordia a longer differentiation period, thereby increasing the number of ears and the length of the ears, resulting in generally higher yields than spring-sown crops. Third, after winter sowing, the seeds undergo the test of severe winter cold underground, which improves the seeds' viability. Fourth, winter sowing adjusts the original sowing and harvesting periods of crops.

In summarizing their experiences, all regions have unanimously concluded that the key to high yields from winter sowing of spring crops is strict adherence to timely sowing and suitable soil moisture content for winter sowing. Early sowing makes the sprouts susceptible to large-scale winterkill, while late sowing results in frozen ground, preventing agricultural machinery from entering the fields. In order to sow more than two million mu of spring wheat and as many other spring crops as possible within a short ten-day period, all regions have made early arrangements for land and seeds for winter sowing of spring crops while sowing winter wheat. They have also convened winter sowing technology seminars with leaders, experienced farmers, and technicians.

Our newspaper, Xining, 24th dispatch: Qinghai Province's more than 500,000 mu of winter-sown spring wheat, highland barley, and other spring grains achieved a double harvest of yields and experience last year. They all grew better than spring-sown crops, with dense stands, strong stalks, large ears, and plump grains, generally yielding more than 10% more than spring-sown spring wheat under approximately the same conditions. During harvesting, all communes and farms mobilized the masses to conduct on-site analysis and research, and further explored many experiences in terms of sowing timing and various management measures.

Spring wheat, highland barley, and other crops were originally spring-sown crops. The bumper harvest from large-scale winter sowing proves that this cultivation technology innovation has great potential in spring wheat producing areas, and has found a way to regulate busy spring agricultural work and increase yield per unit area.

Last year, the spring wheat winter-sown in Qinghai Province was generally sown before the ground froze. Because the ground froze shortly after sowing, it inhibited seed germination, allowing the seeds to pass the cold winter only in a state of germination, so that the wheat seeds were not frozen to death, and they also exercised their ability to resist cold, drought, and disease. The seed germination period was long, so the roots were deeper and the growth was vigorous, and the tillering and filling periods were also relatively prolonged, so there were more tillers and fuller grains, which not only increased yield, but also had a higher flour yield. Its maturity period is also slightly earlier than spring sowing.

The experiment of winter sowing of spring wheat in Qinghai Province has been going on for several years. Qinghai Province has a large cultivated land area per laborer, a long cold season, a short spring sowing time, and spring is often dry and has little rain. Winter sowing of some crops can not only regulate spring agricultural work, but also free up some water to irrigate spring-sown crops.

The benefits of winter sowing of spring wheat have encouraged people of all ethnic groups. Many communes and farms throughout the province plan to double or several times expand winter sowing this winter, and have prepared for sowing. Agricultural departments at the provincial, state, and county levels have sent a group of cadres and technicians to go deep into the communes and farms to specifically guide the masses to summarize experience and do a good job in stubble turning and fertilizer accumulation.

### 春麦冬种穗大粒饱早熟高产  新疆青海积极扩大冬种面积

    春麦冬种穗大粒饱早熟高产
    新疆青海积极扩大冬种面积
    本报乌鲁木齐24日电　新疆维吾尔自治区积极推广春种农作物临冬播种。各地安排春麦临冬播种的面积均比去年扩大了。此外，春种的大麦、青稞、豌豆、扁豆、油菜、葫蒜、红花、大麻等农作物和一些春菜也将部分地实行临冬播种。临冬播种早春作物是自治区农作制度上重大的改革。这项重大的改革可以使自治区每年多收一季庄稼，多收几亿斤粮食和其他农作物、蔬菜等。为了使得这项改革深入人心，自治区许多地方今年都总结了春种作物临冬播种的经验。
    各地总结的经验证明：春种作物临冬播种有许多好处。第一、临冬播种比春种的农作物普遍早熟十多天。第二、临冬播种的种籽萌动后在地下越冬，种籽、穗原体有较长的分化时间，从而增加了穗数和穗的长度，普遍比春种的农作物产量高。第三、临冬播种后，种籽在地下经过冬季严寒考验，提高了种籽的生活能力。第四、临冬播种调整了原有农作物的播种期与收获期。
    各地在总结经验中都一致得出结论，春种作物临冬播种的高产关键是严格掌握适时播种和冬播土壤的墒度合适。早播出芽的容易造成越冬大量死亡，迟播土地冻结，农机具不能进地。为了在短短十天之内播完二百多万亩春麦和尽可能多种其他春种作物，各地在播种冬麦的同时都及早安排了临冬播种春种作物的土地、种籽。并召开了有领导、老农、技术员的临冬播种技术座谈会。
    本报西宁24日电　青海省去年冬季播种的五十多万亩春小麦、青稞等春季麦类作物获得了产量、经验双丰收。它们都比春季播种的长得更好，株密秆壮，穗大粒饱，一般比各项条件大致相同的春播春麦增产10％以上。各公社、农场在收割中都发动群众进行现场分析研究，在播种时机和各项管理措施等方面又进一步摸索到许多经验。
    春小麦、青稞等原来都是春季播种的作物，大面积冬播获得丰产，证明这一耕作技术上的革新在春麦产区大有可为，为调节春季农活繁忙和提高单位面积产量等找到了一条途径。
    去年青海省冬播的春麦一般都是在地冻以前播种的。由于播种后不久土地冻结，抑制了种子出芽，使种子仅在萌动状态中越过寒冬，因而麦种既不致出苗冻死，又锻炼了耐寒、抗旱和抗病的能力。种子萌动期长，因而扎根较深，生长力旺盛，分蘖期和灌浆期也相对延长，所以分蘖多，子粒饱，不仅产量增加，而且出粉率也较高。它的成熟期也较春播的略为提前。
    在青海省试验春麦冬播已有好几年历史。青海省每个劳动力负担的耕地面积较大，寒冷季节较长，春播时间短促，而且春季常常干旱少雨。冬季播种一部分农作物，不仅可以调剂春季农活，还可以腾出一部分水来浇灌春播作物。
    春麦冬播的好处鼓舞了各族人民，全省许多公社和农场都计划今冬成倍或几倍地扩大冬种，而且已为播种作了准备。省、州、县各级农业部门都派了一批干部和技术人员深入社、场，具体指导群众总结经验，早做翻茬、积肥等工作。
