Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 26th - The Bonn government's deliberate policy of atomic armament has aroused unease among the West German public. Recently, the broad masses of the West German public have held rallies and adopted resolutions in various places to oppose the Bonn authorities' policy.

    Brendel, a member of the executive body of the West German "League of Germans," recently delivered a speech in Frankfurt am Main, strongly condemning the West German government's arms policy. According to the league's press release, Brendel pointed out the dangers of Bonn's policy, saying that the main purpose of the Bonn government's current activities is to try every possible means to turn West Germany into an atomic power.

    Brendel also criticized the positions of the opposition parties, the West German Social Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party. He said that they are actually obeying the West German government.

    Hagemann, a well-known West German social activist, emphasized in a speech at a mass meeting in Hanover that the recent memorandum issued by West Germany demanding that the West German army be armed with atomic weapons shows that Bonn politicians are opposed to disarmament and mutual understanding. The Bonn authorities' call for general mobilization, demand for atomic armament, and attempts to implement emergency laws clearly show that Bonn's military plans have become a real fact.

    According to the "Neues Deutschland" report: Heinrich Vogel, a well-known Protestant pastor and professor of theology in West Berlin, recently spoke at a gathering of religious figures, urging all Christians to rise up against the Bonn government's atomic armament policy, against the establishment of missile bases and the installation of atomic weapons in West Germany. Vogel also called on the participants to take action to recognize the German Democratic Republic.

    Many prominent church figures in the West German states have also recently issued appeals against the Bonn authorities' policy of arming West Germany with atomic weapons. They demanded that a treaty of non-aggression be concluded between the two Germanys. Church figures said in the appeal: "Continued arms race and equipping the West German army with atomic weapons will only lead to war."

    西德公众反对政府核武装政策
    揭露波恩政府反对裁军　要求两个德国缔结互不侵犯条约
    新华社波恩26日电　波恩政府处心积虑实行原子武装的政策引起西德公众的不安。西德广大公众最近在各地举行集会和通过决议，反对波恩当局的这种政策。
    西德“德国人联盟”执行机构的成员布伦德最近在美因河上的法兰克福演说时强烈谴责西德政府的军备政策。据这个联盟的新闻公报报道，布伦德在指出波恩政策的危险性时说，波恩政府目前活动的主要目的是在千方百计地想把西德变成一个原子国。
    布伦德还抨击反对党西德社会民主党和自由民主党的立场。他说，它们实际上是听命于西德政府的。
    西德著名的社会活动家哈格曼在汉诺威的群众大会上演说时着重指出，从西德最近发表的要求以原子武器武装西德军队的备忘录表明，波恩政界人士是反对裁军和相互谅解的。波恩当局号召总动员，要求原子军备和企图实行紧急状态法，这些都清楚地表明，波恩军事计划已成为一个真正的事实。
    据“新德意志报”报道：西柏林著名新教徒牧师、神学教授海因里希·沃格尔最近在宗教人士的集会上讲话时，敦促所有基督教徒起来反对波恩政府的原子军备政策，反对在西德建立导弹基地和设置原子武器。沃格尔并且要求与会者为承认德意志民主共和国而行动起来。
    西德各州的许多著名教会人士最近也发表呼吁书，反对波恩当局用原子武器武装西德的政策。他们要求两个德国之间缔结互不侵犯条约。教会人士在这项呼吁书中说：“继续军备竞赛和用原子武器装备西德军队只会导致战争。”
