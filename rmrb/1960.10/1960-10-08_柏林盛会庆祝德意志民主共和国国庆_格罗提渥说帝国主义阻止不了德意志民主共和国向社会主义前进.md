Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th - The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), the Council of Ministers, and the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany held a grand celebration in Berlin tonight to commemorate the 11th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.

Among those attending the celebration were Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the SED and Chairman of the State Council; Prime Minister Grotewohl; Johannes Dieckmann, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber; Professor Correns, Chairman of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany; and other party and state leaders. Max Reimann, First Secretary of the Communist Party of Germany, diplomatic envoys from various countries to the German Democratic Republic, and representatives from all walks of life also attended the celebration.

Prime Minister Grotewohl delivered a speech at the celebration. He said that the main conditions for completing the main economic tasks must be created this year. So far, the implementation of this year's national economic plan is good. By the end of August, 66.2% of the annual plan for bituminous coal had been completed; 66% for coal briquettes; 67.8% for pig iron; 67% for steel; 69.8% for Perlon fiber; and 71.2% for Perlon fabrics. Total industrial output increased by 9.5% compared with the same period last year; bituminous coal by 4.2%; coal briquettes by 2.8%; pig iron by 4.9%; steel by 4.4%; and Perlon fiber by 21.3%.

Grotewohl said that in agriculture, tremendous changes have taken place this year, with all farmers participating in cooperative organizations. As of August 31, there were 19,354 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide, with 954,300 members. Agricultural tasks have increased. Contrary to the predictions of class enemies, agricultural commodity production continues to increase. By the end of August, compared with the same period last year, the number of pigs prepared for slaughter increased by 8%; milk by 6%; beef and other meats by 13%, poultry by 84%; and eggs by 20%. Grotewohl said that the retail trade volume in the first eight months of this year increased by two billion marks compared with the same period last year. Foreign trade has increased significantly.

He said that those who attempt to boycott trade between East and West Germany must understand that their calculations are wrong, because the German Democratic Republic will take swift and forceful action against such practices.

He emphasized that, on the other hand, although trade between East and West Germany has national significance, its importance to the German Democratic Republic should not be overestimated. He pointed out that out of the total import of eight million tons of hard coal, only 250,000 tons come from West Germany. Only 4% of the crude steel used by the German Democratic Republic comes from West Germany. Grotewohl pointed out that a boycott of trade between East and West Germany may cause temporary difficulties. But the German Democratic Republic often encounters the same problems caused by Western embargoes, and it will overcome these difficulties in the same way. No imperialist country in the world can stop the German Democratic Republic from advancing towards socialism.

Grotewohl said that the German Democratic Republic unreservedly supports the policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, ending the Cold War, complete and thorough disarmament worldwide, and the complete eradication of colonialism.

Grotewohl said that West German militarism is the main partner of U.S. imperialism. For many years, the German Democratic Republic has been waging a continuous struggle to destroy the den of Bonn war criminals. The working people of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries are increasingly opposed to their governments supporting Bonn's arms expansion. This emerging turning point in Bonn's international status creates favorable conditions for the peace forces in West Germany to struggle. It is the task of the workers and all patriots in West Germany to force the militarists and revanchists to retreat and to enable the peace-loving democratic forces to occupy an important position.

    柏林盛会庆祝德意志民主共和国国庆
    格罗提渥说帝国主义阻止不了德意志民主共和国向社会主义前进
    新华社柏林6日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会、部长会议和民主德国全国阵线全国委员会今晚在柏林举行盛会，庆祝德意志民主共和国成立十一周年。
    参加庆祝会的有德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记、国务委员会主席瓦尔特·乌布利希、总理格罗提渥、人民议院主席团主席约翰尼斯·狄克曼、民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席柯伦斯教授以及党和国家的其他领导人。德国共产党第一书记马克斯·雷曼、各国驻德意志民主共和国的外交使节和各界代表也参加了庆祝会。
    格罗提渥总理在庆祝会上发表了讲话。他说，必须在今年为完成主要经济任务创造主要条件。到目前为止，今年国民经济计划完成的情况是良好的。到8月底止，烟煤完成了全年计划的66.2％；煤砖66％；生铁67.8％；钢材67％；帕龙丝69.8％；帕龙丝织物71.2％。工业总产量比去年同期增加了9.5％；烟煤4.2％；煤砖2.8％；生铁4.9％；钢材4.4％；帕龙丝21.3％。
    格罗提渥说，在农业方面，今年发生了巨大的变化，所有的农民都参加了合作组织。到8月31日止，全国有一万九千三百五十四个农业生产合作社，拥有社员九十五万四千三百名。农业方面的任务增多了。与阶级敌人的预测相反，农业商品产量继续增加。到8月底，与去年同期相比，预备屠宰的猪增加了8％；牛奶6％；牛肉和其他肉类13％，家禽84％；蛋类20％。格罗提渥说，今年头八个月的零售贸易额比去年同期增加二十亿马克。对外贸易有很大的增加。
    他说，企图抵制东西德贸易的那些人必须明白，他们的算盘打错了。因为德意志民主共和国将就此迅速和有力地采取行动来反对这种做法。
    他强调说，另外一方面，尽管东西德贸易具有民族重要意义，它对德意志民主共和国的重要性不应该作过高的估计。他指出，在全部进口的八百万吨硬煤中，只有二十五万吨来自西德。德意志民主共和国所用的原钢中只有4％来自西德。格罗提渥指出，对东西德贸易的抵制可能会造成暂时的困难。但是德意志民主共和国经常碰到西方的禁运所造成的同样的问题，它将同样地克服这些困难。世界上没有一个帝国主义国家能够阻止德意志民主共和国向社会主义前进。
    格罗提渥说，德意志民主共和国无保留地支持不同社会制度国家之间和平共处、结束冷战、全世界全面彻底裁军和彻底根除殖民主义的政策。
    格罗提渥说，西德军国主义是美帝国主义的主要伙伴。多年来德意志民主共和国进行连续不断的斗争以摧毁波恩战犯的巢穴。北大西洋公约组织国家的劳动人民已越来越反对本国政府支持波恩的扩充军备。这种正在显露出来的波恩在国际地位上的转折，为西德的和平力量创造了有利的斗争条件。迫使军国主义者和复仇主义者退却和使爱好和平的民主势力占有重要地位，是西德工人和全体爱国者的任务。
