Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 4th: North Vietnam's agricultural cooperativization movement continues to advance at a rapid pace. According to recent statistics, since the autumn cooperative establishment campaign began over a month ago, more than 2,178,500 peasant households in North Vietnam have joined agricultural cooperatives, accounting for 78.4% of the total number of peasant households. This means that the number of peasant households joining cooperatives has increased by 23.6% compared to a month ago.

Currently, seventeen provinces in North Vietnam have basically completed the primary agricultural cooperativization. In some advanced provinces, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives has reached more than 90% of the total number of peasant households in the province. In the mountainous provinces of Thai Nguyen and Hoa Binh, more than 76% of peasant households have joined cooperatives.

While developing primary cooperatives, various provinces in North Vietnam are actively establishing advanced agricultural cooperatives on the basis of the original primary agricultural cooperatives. In Thanh Hoa province, fifty-two advanced cooperatives have already been established, and another seventy-eight advanced cooperatives are being planned. In the recent cooperativization movement, the three villages of Quang Khe, Thieu Ly, and Hoang Giang in this province also merged all the agricultural cooperatives in the village into one large cooperative, established a Party branch in each agricultural cooperative, and established a Party group in each production team. Government, militia, and youth and women's organizations are also based on agricultural cooperatives.

In Quang Binh province, 27% of peasant households have joined advanced cooperatives, and the Wu Ning village in this province has merged eight advanced cooperatives into one large cooperative.

After the establishment of advanced cooperatives, many areas have made better arrangements for production, such as dividing livestock farms and planting areas for cash crops, rice, and miscellaneous grains, opening improved farm tool factories, and holding fertilizer experiment groups, thus playing a positive role in promoting production for this winter and next spring.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 4th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, along with the vigorous development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the cooperativization movement of the fishing, handicraft, and salt industries in North Vietnam is also developing rapidly.

As of September 24th, 64% of fishermen in North Vietnam had joined fishing cooperatives. The five coastal provinces have basically completed fishing cooperativization. The number of fishermen participating in cooperatives in these provinces has increased from 71.7% to 95%.

More than 73% of handicraft workers in North Vietnam have embarked on the road of collective production.

At the same time, Thai Binh province, Quang Binh province, Kien An province, and Hai Phong city have announced that 92%, 87%, 76%, and 82% of local salt workers have embarked on the road of cooperativization, respectively.

    越南北方加速社会主义改造步伐
    农业合作化运动迅速发展　78.4％的农户已经入社

    新华社河内4日电　越南北方的农业合作化运动继续以迅速的步伐前进。据最近统计，自秋季建社运动开展一个多月以来，越南北方加入农业社的农户已有二百一十七万八千五百多户，占农户总数的78.4％。这就是说，入社农户比一个月以前多23.6％。
    目前，越南北方已有十七个省基本上完成了初级农业合作化。某些先进省份的入社农户已达到全省农户总数的90％以上。在山区的太原与和平省，也有76％以上的农户入了社。
    越南北方各省在发展初级合作社的同时，在原有初级农业合作社的基础上，正在纷纷建立高级农业合作社。在清化省，已经建立了五十二个高级社，另有七十八个高级社正在筹建中。在最近的合作化运动中，这个省的广溪、绍里、黄江三个乡还分别把全乡所有的农业社合并成一个大社，每个农业社建立一个党支部，每个生产队建立一个党小组。政权、民兵以及青年、妇女等组织，也都以农业社为单位。
    在广平省，已有27％的农户加入高级社，这个省的武宁乡把八个高级社合并成了一个大社。
    许多地区在建立了高级合作社以后，对生产作了更好的安排，如划分畜牧场和经济作物、水稻、杂粮等种植区，开办改良农具厂，举办肥料试验组等，因而，对今冬明春的生产起了积极的推动作用。
    新华社河内4日电　据越南通讯社报道：和农业合作化运动的蓬勃发展同时，越南北方的渔业、手工业和制盐业的合作化运动也在迅速发展。
    截至9月24日为止，越南北方已有64％的渔民加入了渔业合作社。沿海五个省已经基本上完成了渔业合作化。这些省参加合作社的渔民从71.7％增加到了95％。
    越南北方的手工业工人目前已有73％以上走上了集体生产的道路。
    与此同时，太平省、广平省、建安省和海防市已经宣布，当地制盐工人中已经分别有92％、87％、76％和82％走上了合作化道路。
