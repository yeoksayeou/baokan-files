    Lao Fighting Forces Radio Comments on Current Political Developments in Laos
    Resolutely Oppose All Open and Hidden Traitors
    Points out that Rebellion Groups are Intensifying Activities Under Rampant American Interference, and Vigilance Must Be Heightened Against This
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Lao Fighting Forces Radio broadcast a commentary on the 20th entitled "Although Parsons has Rolled Out of Laos, Our People Must Still Be Vigilant Against the Secret and Cunning Activities of Their Claws." The commentary said:
    According to Vientiane Radio and foreign news: US Assistant Secretary of State Parsons’ intimidation scheme and coercion of the Souvanna Phouma government to accept and implement various conditions wantonly put forward by US imperialists have failed. However, historical lessons tell us that US imperialists are very cunning. If this method does not work, they will find other methods. Parsons just rolled out of Laos and immediately convened a meeting of US ambassadors to Southeast Asian countries, and conspired with the Thai and South Vietnamese reactionaries to continue to threaten the King and government of Laos. At the same time, the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group and a small group of accomplices have stepped up their activities to create chaos and sabotage from within, as a backing for Parsons to continue his coercion scheme. Khamphan Panya is the most important and most harmful figure among the claws of the traitorous group. He is responsible for creating unrest and chaos, colluding with some officials to encircle and coerce the King of Laos, continuing to attack the Lao Fighting Forces in Phongsaly and Sayaboury, and carrying out the rebellion previously launched in Xieng Khouang.
    While US imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group are carrying out the above-mentioned conspiracy, Van Rathikone is constantly colluding secretly with the Phoumi group. Van Rathikone has surprisingly disappeared. There are reports that he went to Savannakhet, but according to political circles in Vientiane and Luang Prabang, Van Rathikone has gone to Luang Prabang to meet with Khamphan Panya. Public opinion believes that in order to realize Parsons' plan, Van Rathikone has cooperated with Khamphan Panya and another person to carry out something.
    The above-mentioned matters clearly show how harmful US imperialism's conspiracy is to the Kingdom's government and Laos. The Lao people are cheered to see the growth of their struggle strength, but at the same time they must further heighten their vigilance against the enemy's above-mentioned conspiracy and be determined to fight to smash their new conspiracy.
    The people are always willing to support the government's clearly expressed attitude of not yielding to others and unflinchingly implementing its adherence to peace, neutrality, and national harmony.
    Therefore, the people express doubts about the fact that the King and government have not yet formally accepted the credentials presented by the Soviet ambassador, and have not yet studied the issue of seeking Soviet economic assistance to resist the intimidation of US imperialism. US imperialism is now not only not stopping the aid it once threatened to stop, but on the contrary, it has announced that it will continue to provide harmful military aid. What worries the people even more is that Van Rathikone's so-called "fairness" is actually in contact with Phoumi Nosavan. As people know, Van Rathikone's activities with this group violate the government's line and policy, but the government has not expressed any attitude towards his various ambiguous actions.
    Public opinion has clearly stated that it is necessary to resolutely struggle and support the government's efforts to realize the policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony. However, it is hoped that in the current struggle for national neutrality, the Souvanna Phouma government must be the representative of the sincere wishes of all the Lao people.
    (Reported by this newspaper) A commentary published by the Lao Fighting Forces Radio on the 22nd pointed out that US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Parsons has rolled out of Laos, but its vicious conspiracy is still being carried out through the unspeakable activities of some of its loyal lackeys.
    The commentary pointed out that Parsons had just rolled out of Laos when Van Rathikone secretly slipped away from Vientiane. According to local news, Van Rathikone has gone to Luang Prabang to meet with Khamphan Panya. Khamphan Panya's task is to contact some officers in the Kingdom's army who sympathize with the traitorous group and conspire to encircle the King. According to Saigon Radio's broadcast on the 19th, some important figures sympathetic to the Phoumi Nosavan group are carrying out activities in Luang Prabang City like the coup in Xieng Khouang. The commentary also pointed out that Van Rathikone also met with Colonel Huang Phan, commander of the First Military Region, and Khamvin, commander of Phongsaly, to plan an attack on the Lao Fighting Forces stationed in Phongsaly. Under Van Rathikone's instructions, some officers are transferring troops to Namo, Hongsa, and Sayaboury to prepare for a large-scale offensive against the Lao Fighting Forces. In addition, they have continuously intensified their mopping-up and suppression of the people in Phongsaly and Sayaboury.
    The commentary pointed out that according to Thai and South Vietnamese radio stations, the Kingdom's army in the First Military Region, still under the command of Phoumi Nosavan, is attacking the Lao Fighting Forces.
    The commentary pointed out that another result of Parsons' activities in Laos is that some politicians in Vientiane have wavered ideologically. The commentary said that the King and government's attitude of implementing a policy of peace and neutrality has been somewhat slow and abnormal, specifically manifested in the differential treatment of the Soviet ambassador and Parsons.
    The commentary finally pointed out that at present, the most effective measures must be taken to resolutely oppose the treasonous activities of the running dogs of US imperialism. Whether they are openly treasonous elements or elements hidden within the Kingdom's government, they must be resolutely opposed.

    寮国战斗部队电台评目前老挝政局动向
    坚决反对一切公开和隐藏的叛国分子
    指出在美国猖狂干涉下叛乱集团正在加紧活动对此必须提高警惕
    本报讯　寮国战斗部队电台20日以“帕森斯虽然已经滚出老挝，但是我国人民还要对它们的爪牙的秘密和狡诈的活动提高警惕”为题发表评论。评论说：
    据万象电台和外国消息：美国助理国务卿帕森斯在进行恫吓阴谋并要挟梭发那·富马政府接受和实行美帝国主义者肆无忌惮地所提出的各种条件遭到失败。但是历史教训告诉我们：美帝国主义者是很狡猾的，这个办法无效，它就另找其他办法。帕森斯刚滚出老挝，就赶紧召集了美国驻东南亚各国大使会议，并同泰国和越南南方反动集团阴谋继续威胁老挝国王和政府。与此同时，富米·诺萨万叛国集团及其一小撮同伙加强了制造混乱和从内部进行破坏的活动，以作为帕森斯继续进行要挟阴谋的后盾。坎番·班雅是叛国集团的爪牙中最重要而且最有害的人物，他负有制造不安、混乱，拉拢一部分官员进行包围、要挟老挝国王，继续进攻丰沙里和沙耶布里的寮国战斗部队，和进行以前在川圹发动的叛变等任务。
    当美帝国主义以及富米·诺萨万叛国集团正在进行上述阴谋的时候，万·拉迪功不断地同富米集团秘密地进行勾结，万·拉迪功使人惊讶地失踪了，有消息说他前往沙湾拿吉，但据万象和琅勃拉邦政界消息透露，万·拉迪功已去琅勃拉邦同坎番·班雅会晤。人民的舆论认为，为了实现帕森斯的计划，万·拉迪功已同坎番·班雅以及另外某一个人配合来进行某件事情。
    上述事情清楚地说明，美帝国主义的阴谋对王国政府和老挝的危害性有多么大。老挝人民看见自己的斗争力量的壮大都表示欢欣鼓舞，但是同时必须对敌人的上述阴谋进一步提高警惕和决心为粉碎它们新的阴谋而斗争。
    人民随时愿意支持政府所明确表示的，不向别人让步和不屈地执行自己所坚持的和平、中立和民族和睦的态度。
    因此，人民对国王和政府直到现在还没有正式接受苏联大使呈递国书以及还没有研究争取苏联经济援助以抵制美帝国主义的恫吓的问题表示疑虑。美帝国主义现在不仅不停止它所一度恫吓的要停止的援助，相反地却公布要继续给予带有危害性的军事援助。人民更感到忧虑的是：万·拉迪功的所谓“公平”，实际上是同富米·诺萨万联络。如人们所知道，万·拉迪功同这个集团的活动是违反政府的路线和政策的，可是对他的各种暧昧行动，却不见政府表示任何态度。
    人民的舆论已明确地认为，必须坚决地斗争，并支持政府为实现和平中立和民族和睦政策而作出的一切努力。但是希望在目前为民族的中立的斗争中，梭发那·富马政府必须是全体老挝人民的恳切愿望的代表者。
    本报讯　寮国战斗部队电台22日发表的一篇评论指出，美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿帕森斯滚出老挝了，但它的恶毒阴谋仍然通过它的一些忠实走狗的不可告人的活动继续进行着。
    评论指出，帕森斯刚刚滚出老挝，万·拉迪功就秘密地从万象溜走。据来自地方的消息说，万·拉迪功已经到琅勃拉邦同坎番·班雅会晤。坎番·班雅的任务是同王国军队中同情叛国集团的一些军官联系，阴谋包围国王。据西贡电台19日广播，同情富米·诺萨万集团的一些重要人物正在琅勃拉邦市进行像在川圹政变的活动。评论还指出，万·拉迪功还同第一军区司令黄番大校和丰沙里指挥官坎温会晤，策划进攻驻在丰沙里的寮国战斗部队。在万·拉迪功的指示下，一些军官正在向南俄、红舍、沙耶布里调军队准备向寮国战斗部队展开大规模进攻。此外，它们还接连不断地在丰沙里、沙耶布里加强扫荡和镇压人民。
    评论指出，据泰国和南越电台透露，还在富米·诺萨万的指挥下的第一军区的王国军队正在向寮国战斗部队进攻。
    评论指出帕森斯在老挝活动的另外一个结果是，万象一些政客有了思想动摇。评论说，国王和政府实行和平中立政策的态度已经有所迟缓和不正常，具体表现在对苏联大使和帕森斯的分别对待。
    评论最后指出，目前必须采取最有效的措施，坚决反对美帝国主义走狗的叛国活动，不论他们是公开叛国的分子还是隐藏在王国政府内部的分子都必须坚决反对。
