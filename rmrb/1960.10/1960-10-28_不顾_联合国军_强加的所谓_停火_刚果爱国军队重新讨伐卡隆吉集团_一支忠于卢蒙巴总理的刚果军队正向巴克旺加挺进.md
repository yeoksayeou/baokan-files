Xinhua News Agency, Elisabethville, 26th: Defying the interference of the "United Nations Force" and the so-called "ceasefire" imposed upon them, Congolese patriotic troops have resumed military operations against the Kalonji separatist group in Kasai Province, which is supported by imperialism. It is reported that a Congolese army loyal to Prime Minister Lumumba launched an attack on some strongholds occupied by the Kalonji group on the 25th.

On the 24th, the reactionary army authorities under the control of the Kalonji group said that a Congolese army of 1,000 men was advancing towards Bakwanga, the group's lair. The group demanded that the "United Nations Force" intervene to stop the advance of the patriotic army.

It is said that this Congolese army set out from the Kabinda area in northeastern Kasai Province and was replenished with weapons and ammunition in Luluabourg (the capital of Kasai Province).

In August of this year, the Congolese central government, headed by Prime Minister Lumumba, mobilized troops to advance towards Kasai Province and Katanga Province to fight against the Kalonji and Tshombe separatist groups fostered by imperialism. The Congolese army captured Bakwanga on August 27 and advanced victoriously to the south. However, the patriotic actions of the Congolese army were interfered with by the "United Nations Force."

The "United Nations Force," colluding with Mobutu, the Congolese army chief of staff who launched the rebellion, forced the Congolese army to "cease fire" and ordered them to withdraw to their original stations.

    不顾“联合国军”强加的所谓“停火”
    刚果爱国军队重新讨伐卡隆吉集团
    一支忠于卢蒙巴总理的刚果军队正向巴克旺加挺进
    新华社26日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：刚果爱国军队不顾“联合国军”的干涉和强加在他们头上的所谓“停火”，重新开始了讨伐在帝国主义支持下的开赛省卡隆吉分裂集团的军事行动，据报道，一支忠于卢蒙巴总理的刚果军队25日向卡隆吉集团盘踞下的一些据点发动了进攻。
    在24日，卡隆吉集团控制下的反动军队当局说，一支有一千人的刚果军队正向这个集团的巢穴巴克旺加挺进。这个集团要求“联合国军”出面干涉以制止爱国军队的前进。
    据说，这支刚果军队是从开赛省东北部的卡宾达地区出发，并在路路阿堡（开赛省省会）得到武器弹药的补充。
    今年8月，以卢蒙巴总理为首的刚果中央政府调集军队向开赛省和加丹加省前进，讨伐卡隆吉和冲伯这两个帝国主义所扶植的分裂集团。刚果军队曾于8月27日攻克了巴克旺加，并乘胜向南挺进。但是，刚果军队的爱国行动，遭到“联合国军”的干涉。
    “联合国军”同发动叛乱的刚果陆军参谋长蒙博托相勾结，强迫刚果军队“停火”，并要他们撤回原驻地。
