Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 15th - Fujian Province's single-season late rice harvesting work has gradually unfolded from north to south. The single-season late rice harvesting in northern Fujian, western Fujian, and eastern Fujian has successively entered a busy stage of rushing to harvest. Up to now, Nanping, Fu'an, Minhou, Longyan and other regions have harvested more than 300,000 mu of single-season late rice.

Since the beginning of October, the single-season late rice and some intercropped late rice have begun to ripen. In order to strive for every grain to be returned to the granary, all localities have made autumn harvest plans in advance and rationally arranged labor. Zhimagong Commune Zhimada Brigade in Guangze County and Hushu Brigade in Shibei Commune, Shaowu County, have comprehensively promoted the experience of meticulous harvesting, such as adding fences to grain buckets, surrounding the drying ground with fences (to prevent poultry and domestic animals from stealing food and save labor for watching the field), light cutting, light placing, multiple turning, and multiple beating. Jianyang, Pucheng, Gutian and other counties and communes have also carried out autumn harvest tool reforms and repaired a large number of mountain roads and field roads in advance, carrying out a one-stop competition of harvesting, threshing, transporting, drying, and storing, so as to achieve fast and meticulous harvesting.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the frontline of the autumn harvest and the weak links, party and government leading organs at all levels have also transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside to participate in and lead the autumn harvest. Longxi and Nanping regions have recently added 1,195 cadres from the regional and directly affiliated organs to settle in remote mountainous areas to strengthen the autumn harvest leadership in weak areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 15th - Jiangxi Province is rushing to harvest the single-season late rice crop, striving to harvest, thresh, and glean the late rice cleanly, ensuring every grain is returned to the granary.

To ensure the timely and good harvest of single-season late rice, all localities first focused on grasping labor organization and task implementation during the harvest. In Yichun region, each commune reasonably divided labor according to the harvest task and work sequence, forming various professional groups for harvesting, threshing, transportation, and drying. The single-season late rice harvest was generally fast and good.

During the rush harvest, Yifeng, Wanzai, Jing'an and other counties put forward the slogan "Precise harvesting and meticulous threshing, harvesting seven to ten more catties of grain per mu," and comprehensively mobilized and organized commune members to discuss and formulate operating procedures for harvesting and drying, and carried out a major evaluation and competition of harvesting quality between teams and groups, making the late rice harvest cleaner. Fengxin County, in response to the shortcomings of easily scattering grain when dragging buckets for threshing in the fields in the past, changed from dragging buckets to threshing to fixed rice buckets for threshing, adding bamboo mats under the threshing buckets and setting up reed screens around to avoid losses and waste. According to the statistics of various communes, implementing fixed rice bucket threshing alone can harvest more than ten catties of rice per mu. Many areas also organized semi-laborers to form re-harvesting teams and grain-picking teams for re-harvesting.

In order to help the single-season late rice areas rush to harvest and harvest the late rice well, various localities have also widely carried out communist collaboration. Wuyuan, Dexing and other mountainous communes and production teams have large areas of single-season late rice, so the communes and production teams in the plains actively transferred labor to support them according to the principle of equivalent exchange, ensuring that the mountainous areas have sufficient labor to rush to harvest. All walks of life have also transferred manpower to support the rush harvest, and industrial and commercial departments have also given priority to supplying a large number of new-style tools such as harvesters and threshers to the single-season late rice areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 15th - People's communes in Hunan Province are harvesting single-season late rice, late-maturing mid-season rice, and early-maturing miscellaneous grains in a timely manner. Inspired by the call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, 740,000 commune members participating in the harvest are meticulously harvesting, striving to harvest more grain on the basis of various intensive management practices. As of the 11th, the province had harvested 13,710,000 mu of rice and more than 4,750,000 mu of miscellaneous grains such as corn, sorghum, millet, and mung beans.

Before the harvest, all localities made harvesting plans as early as possible. Changde, Xiangtan and other regions appraised and classified the fields from the commune to the work group, and formulated a comprehensive meticulous harvesting plan according to the different maturity periods of the crops, and implemented it to each field to ensure that one field is harvested as soon as it matures. Gaoping Commune in Liuyang County summed up the experience of meticulous harvesting of early and mid-season rice, estimated the yield and identified each of the commune's 6,000+ mu of late rice fields, determined the harvesting date for each field, implemented fixed personnel, fixed areas, fixed quality, fixed time, fixed remuneration, and fixed methods, and carried out a competition movement with meticulous harvesting as the center, high speed, and high quality. Erhe Commune in Dayong County, according to the characteristics of the scattered and inconsistent maturity of small miscellaneous grains, adopted the method of overall planning, unified arrangement, harvesting first those that mature first, and harvesting later those that mature later, greatly reducing the phenomenon of grain loss.

Cadres at all levels went deep into the front line of the rush harvest, strengthened leadership, and rationally arranged labor to ensure meticulous harvesting. Ma Gengtian, the first secretary of the Guzhang County Party Committee, went deep into the Hongxing Brigade of the Pingba Commune and threshed rice with the commune members, discussed with the cadres and commune members, rationally arranged labor, and organized labor competitions. Not only did the work efficiency improve compared to before, but also meticulous harvesting was achieved. From the county to the production team, the 1,115 four-level secretaries and 3,092 rural cadres in Fenghuang County all went deep into the fields and drying grounds, not only grasping the timely harvesting of rice, but also grasping the meticulous harvesting of miscellaneous grains. After Liu Zhen, a member of the County Party Committee, went deep into the Duye Brigade of Changping Commune, he studied with the old farmers, summed up the method of dividing labor according to technical expertise and mixing rice stalks from light to heavy, and immediately promoted it throughout the county.

All localities also paid attention to good storage and management. Dayong County adopted the method of concentrating leadership, labor, and tools to vigorously grasp the drying and storage of rice. The drying yard of Maogang Commune increased from the original 64 to 109, the number of drying staff increased from 221 to 334, and 668 new drying mats were added. Each drying yard was assigned a special person to be responsible for drying and guarding, and the amount of sun-dried rice increased from 116,000 catties to 245,000 catties. Longshan County renovated and disinfected all the warehouses in the county, and after inspection, the new grain put into storage was basically free of rat holes and mildew.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 15th - Sichuan is starting to rush harvest and meticulously harvest single-season late rice and further strengthen the later-stage management of double-season late rice.

This year, under the guidance of the ideology of seizing early planting, seizing more planting, and seizing high yield, various localities in Sichuan rushed to plant a large amount of single-season late rice, and managed it immediately after planting. Therefore, this year's single-season late rice is not only large in area, but also has long ears and full grains. In order to bring back the fruits of the harvest without leaving a single grain, various localities have conscientiously implemented various effective methods of precise harvesting and meticulous threshing. According to surveys, the quality of harvesting and threshing in southern Sichuan, which has entered the stage of comprehensive harvesting and threshing, has improved compared to early and mid-season rice.

In the work of harvesting and threshing single-season late rice, the secretaries of party organizations at all levels and the vast number of cadres in many people's communes in Nanchong, Mianyang and other regions have gone deep into the harvesting and threshing sites, making the harvesting and threshing work fast and meticulous. Many people's communes in Yibin, Jiangjin and other regions have also carried out the "Red Flag Mixing Bucket" competition with the "Secretary Bucket" and "Cadre Bucket" as the core, comparing progress and quality, making the precise harvesting and meticulous threshing work a vigorous mass movement.

While rushing to harvest and meticulously harvest single-season late rice, all localities have generally strengthened the later-stage field management of double-season late rice to promote its early maturity and high yield. Yibin region adopted methods such as deep-water irrigation and multiple topdressing to increase the field temperature. At the same time, combined with manure accumulation, grass piles were placed on the edge of the field for fumigation, and it recently overcame two cold waves, allowing double-season late rice to flower normally.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 15th - The autumn grain on the Guizhou Plateau is golden all over the mountains. People of all ethnic groups are waving their sickles to harvest rice, corn, and various grains. According to statistics in early October, the autumn grain harvest area in the province has accounted for more than 60% of the planting area.

Rice is the staple food of the people of Guizhou, of which more than 90% is single-season mid-season rice, which is harvested late. About two-thirds of the corn are also medium- and late-maturing varieties. This year, many areas of Guizhou Province have suffered continuous disasters such as floods, droughts, insects, and hail, but under the encouragement of the Party's policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, the people's communes persisted in the fight against disasters and achieved a better harvest.

In order to harvest all kinds of grain, before the harvest, local leading cadres went deep into the front line of the harvest and summarized the experience of the autumn harvest last year and the summer harvest this year with the masses, and formulated operating procedures from harvesting and threshing to transportation and drying. At the end of September, the province's rice harvest entered a busy period, and the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee promptly promoted the experience of the three transformations of threshing (surrounding with mats, roofing, and connecting with rice stalks) and re-threshing rice straw, effectively promoting the precise harvesting and meticulous threshing movement in various parts of the province, so that every plant and ear was contested and no grain was lost. In various parts of Qiannan Buyi Autonomous Prefecture, towing grain boats and surrounding threshing floors with mats were commonly used in autumn grain harvesting and threshing. In Jinping, Suiyang and other counties, 70% of the threshing floors used surrounding mats. In Yuping, Chadian and other communes in Tongren County, the rice was generally cut and handled lightly during harvesting, and children were organized to pick up scattered rice ears and grains. When harvesting corn, each production team in the mountainous management area of ​​Qingshui Commune in Bijie County carried a cloth bag and picked up the corn kernels that fell on the ground at any time.

In areas where actions were taken earlier, after the autumn harvest was basically completed, some semi-laborers were generally organized to carry out the movement of re-harvesting and re-threshing. Through inspection, Naiyan Management Area of ​​Yangba Commune in Anlong County carried out a rush week for re-harvesting and re-threshing. Wanchao Commune in Kaili County re-threshed more than 10,000 catties of grain from the rice straw in more than 1,100 mu of fields. According to key investigations in various places, due to precise harvesting and meticulous threshing, an average of more than 20 catties of grain were harvested per mu of rice.

As the autumn harvest is fully unfolded, a high tide of enthusiastically selling public grain and surplus grain is forming in the rural areas of the province. A movement of autumn plowing and autumn planting by thousands of troops and horses has appeared in some areas. It is expected that the autumn harvest in the province will be basically completed before the end of October.

    福建江西湖南四川四省乘胜前进
    适时开镰细收细打一季晚稻
    贵州各族社员战胜各种自然灾害，全面收割中稻、玉米和各种杂粮
    新华社福州15日电　福建省的单季晚稻收割工作已由北到南逐步展开。闽北、闽西、闽东等地单季晚稻的收割工作已陆续进入抢收大忙阶段。到日前止，南平、福安、闽侯、龙岩等专区已收获单季晚稻三十多万亩。
    从10月初以来，各地单季晚稻和部分间作的晚稻，都已开始黄熟。为了力争颗粒还仓，各地都事先作好秋收规划，合理地安排了劳力。光泽县止马公社止马大队和邵武县水北公社胡书大队，全面推广了谷桶加围、晒场围篱笆（防止家禽、家兽偷食和节省看场劳力）、轻割、轻放、多翻、多打等细打细收的经验。建阳、浦城、古田等县各公社在秋收中还大搞秋收工具改革和事先整修大批山路、田间大道，开展收、打、送、晒、藏一条龙竞赛，作到收的快、收的细。
    为了加强秋收第一线和薄弱环节的领导，各级党政领导机关还抽调大批干部下乡，边参加秋收，边领导秋收。龙溪、南平两专区的地、专直属机关最近增调了一千一百九十五名干部到偏远山区安家落户，加强薄弱地区的秋收领导。
    新华社南昌15日电　江西省突击抢收一季晚稻，力争晚稻收净、打净、拣净，颗粒归仓。
    为确保一季晚稻适时收割，收细收好，各地在收获中首先突出抓劳动组织，抓任务落实。宜春专区各公社按收获任务、按工序合理分工，组成收割、打谷、运输、晒藏各种专业组，分工协作，晚稻收割普遍既快又好。
    在抢收中，宜丰、万载、靖安等县提出“精收细打，每亩多收七至十斤粮”，全面发动和组织各公社社员讨论制定收割、打晒操作规程，并开展队与队、组与组收获质量大评比、大竞赛，使晚稻收打更加干净。奉新县针对过去田间拖桶打谷容易抛撒粮食的缺点，改拖桶打谷为固定禾桶打谷，在打谷桶下面加铺篾垫，周围加设席嶂，避免了损失浪费。据各公社检查统计，仅实行固定禾桶打谷一项，每亩即可多收禾谷十斤以上。许多地区还组织半劳力成立复收队、拣粮队进行复收。
    为了帮助一季晚稻地区抢收和收好晚稻，各地还广泛开展了共产主义大协作。婺源、德兴等县山区公社和生产队的一季晚稻面积大，平原地区的公社和生产队就按照等价交换原则主动抽调劳力支援，保证山区都有足够的劳动力抢收。各行各业也都抽调人力支援抢收，工业、商业部门还优先供应了一季晚稻地区大批收割器、打谷机等新式工具。
    新华社长沙15日电　湖南省各地人民公社适时收割单季晚稻、迟熟中稻和早熟杂粮。七十四万参加收割的社员在大办农业、大办粮食号召的鼓舞下，细收细打，力争在多种精管的基础上再多收一些粮食。截至11日止，全省已收稻一千三百七十一万亩，玉米、高粱、粟、绿豆等杂粮四百七十五万多亩。
    在收割之前，各地都及早作好收割规划。常德、湘潭等专区从公社到作业组逐丘鉴定，分类排队，根据作物的不同成熟期，制定了全面的细打细收规划，并且落实到丘，保证成熟一丘收一丘。浏阳县高坪公社总结了早、中稻细收细打的经验，对全社的六千多亩晚稻田逐块估产鉴定，确定每丘田的收割日期，实行定人员、定地区、定质量、定时间、定报酬、定办法，开展以细打细收为中心的高速度、高质量的评比竞赛运动。大庸县二河公社根据小杂粮分散、成熟期不一致的特点，采取全面规划，统一安排，先熟先收，后熟后收的办法，大大减少了丢粒现象。
    各级干部都深入抢收第一线，加强领导，合理安排劳动力，保证做到细打细收。古丈县县委第一书记马耕田深入到坪坝公社红星大队和社员一起打稻，同干部和社员一起商量，合理安排劳力，组织劳动竞赛，不但工效较前提高，而且做到了细打细收。凤凰县从县到生产队的四级书记一千一百一十五人和农村干部三千零九十二人，人人都深入田间、晒场，不但抓好了稻谷的适时收割，也抓好了杂粮的细打细收。县委委员刘真深入到长坪公社杜叶大队后，和老农一起研究，总结了按技术特长分工以及先轻后重等拌禾方法，立即在全县推广。
    各地还注意了藏好、管好。大庸县采取领导、劳力、工具三集中的办法，大抓稻谷翻晒入库。茅岗公社的晒坪由原来的六十四处增加到一百零九处，晒谷员由二百二十一人增加到三百三十四人，还新增加晒垫六百六十八床，每个晒坪都确定了专人负责翻晒和看管，日晒干稻由十一万六千斤增加到二十四万五千斤。龙山县对全县仓库都修整消毒，经过检查，使入库的新粮基本上做到了无鼠洞、无霉烂。
    新华社成都15日电　四川各地开始抢收、细收一季晚稻和进一步加强双季晚稻后期管理。
    今年，四川各地在抓早种、抓多种、抓高产的思想指导下，抢栽了大量的一季晚稻，而且种下就管，因而今年的一季晚稻不但面积大，而且穗长粒饱。为了把丰收果实一粒不漏地拿回来，各地都认真贯彻了各项行之有效的精收细打办法，已经进入全面收打阶段的川南地区，据调查，收打质量比早稻、中稻又有所提高。
    在收打一季晚稻的工作中，南充、绵阳等专区的许多人民公社，各级党组织的书记和广大干部，都深入到收打现场，使收打工作做得又快又细。宜宾、江津等专区的许多人民公社还以“书记桶”“干部桶”为核心，开展了比进度、比质量的“红旗拌桶”竞赛，使精收细打工作形成了轰轰烈烈的群众运动。
    各地在抢收、细收一季晚稻的同时，都普遍加强了双季晚稻的后期田间管理，促使其早熟、高产。宜宾专区采取深水灌溉和多追肥等办法，提高田间温度，同时结合积肥，在田边放草堆，进行熏烟，在最近战胜了两次寒潮的袭击，使双季晚稻正常扬花。
    新华社贵阳15日电　贵州高原漫山秋粮一片金黄。各族社员正挥镰收割水稻、玉米和各种杂粮。据十月上旬统计，全省秋粮收获面积已占种植面积的60％以上。
    水稻是贵州人民的主粮，其中90％以上是收获期晚的单季中稻。大约三分之二的玉米也是中熟和晚熟品种。今年贵州省不少地区连续遭受水、旱、虫、雹等灾害，但各人民公社在党的大办农业、大办粮食的方针鼓舞下，坚持抗灾斗争，夺得了较好的收成。
    为了把各种粮食全部收回来，各地领导干部在收割前就深入收获第一线和群众一道总结了去年秋收和今年夏收中的经验，制订了从收、打到运、晒的操作规程。9月底全省水稻收获进入大忙时期，中共贵州省委又及时推广了挞斗三化（围席化、顶篷化、接谷蔸化）和复打谷草的经验，有效地推动了全省各地的精收细打运动，做到出现了株穗必争颗粒不丢。黔南布依族自治州各地，在秋粮收割、脱粒中，普遍使用了拖谷船、围席挞斗。锦屏、绥阳等县70％的挞斗使用了围席。铜仁县玉屏、茶店等公社在收割中一般都做到了割谷轻提轻放，同时组织儿童拾拣散落的谷穗谷粒。毕节县清水公社高山管理区各生产小队在收玉米时，每人都带一个布袋，随时把掉在地上的玉米粒拣起。
    动手较早的地区，在秋收基本结束之后，还普遍组织部分半劳力开展复收复打运动。安龙县秧坝公社乃言管理区通过检查，开展复收复打突击周。凯里县万潮公社在一千一百多亩田的谷草里复打出谷子一万多斤。据各地重点调查，由于精收细打，每亩水稻平均多收了二十多斤粮食。
    随着秋收全面展开，全省农村踊跃交售公粮和余粮的高潮正在形成。部分地区已出现了千军万马秋耕秋种的运动。预计全省秋收将在10月底以前基本结束。
