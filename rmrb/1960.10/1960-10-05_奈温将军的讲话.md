Xinhua News Agency, 4th: General Ne Win, Chief of Staff of the Burmese Defense Forces, delivered the following farewell speech at the Beijing Railway Station:

    Your Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai, Friends:

    Premier Zhou Enlai of China and Prime Minister U Nu of Burma have made efforts from the beginning to the present to enhance Sino-Burmese friendship. It is undeniable that the development of Sino-Burmese friendly relations has achieved such results due to the efforts of the leaders of the two countries. As for myself, I did a little something for Sino-Burmese friendship in 1955. In January of this year, I came to China again and signed the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the agreement on the Sino-Burmese border issue, laying the foundation for resolving the Sino-Burmese border issue.

    This time, because we finally and completely resolved the Sino-Burmese border issue, the edifice of Sino-Burmese peace and friendship has finally been completed. I am particularly happy about this.

    Of course, there are many people in both China and Burma who have worked for Sino-Burmese friendship, and I cannot list them all here. All those who have worked for Sino-Burmese friendship will be recorded in history.

    Now that the edifice of Sino-Burmese peace and friendship has been completed, we must continue to make great efforts to ensure that the edifice of Sino-Burmese peace and friendship shines forever. As for myself, I will do my best to maintain this edifice.

    I came to China in 1955 and again this year, and I am truly amazed by the achievements of China's construction. Of course, some people will be happy to see China's construction achievements, while others may not be happy, and some may even be jealous. I know that China is still not satisfied with the achievements it has already made, and China is moving forward bravely on the road to progress, which I cannot help but admire.

    This time, when the Burmese government delegation headed by Prime Minister U Nu and other Burmese delegations came to Beijing, Chinese friends and ambassadors from various countries welcomed us in the rain, and I express my gratitude for this. I especially thank the Chinese friends for their meticulous hospitality to us, as arranged by the Chinese Premier.

    Finally, let me wish Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, Marshal Chen Yi, Marshal Lin Biao, Marshal He Long, and Chief of General Staff Luo Ruiqing good health and happiness.

    奈温将军的讲话
    新华社4日讯　缅甸国防军总参谋长奈温将军在北京车站的告别讲话，全文如下：周恩来总理阁下，朋友们：
    为增进中缅友好，从开始到现在作过努力的是中国的周恩来总理和缅甸的吴努总理。不可否认，中缅友好关系的发展取得如此成果是由于两国领导人的努力。至于我，我在1955年曾经为中缅友好作过一点事情。今年1月，我再次来到中国，同中国方面签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅边界问题的协定，为解决中缅边界问题奠定了基础。
    这次，由于我们最后彻底地解决了中缅边界问题，中缅和平友好大厦终于建成。我为此特别高兴。
    当然，中国和缅甸都有很多人，为中缅友好作过努力，我在这里不可能一一列举。所有这些为中缅友好作过努力的人将永载史册。
    现在，中缅和平友好大厦已经落成，为了使中缅和平友好大厦永放光彩，我们还要继续作很大的努力。至于我，我要为维护这个大厦尽最大的努力。
    我在1955年来过中国，今年又来中国，看到中国建设的成就确实令人惊奇。当然，有些人看到中国的建设成就会高兴，也有些人可能会不高兴，有些人还会产生嫉妒。我知道中国仍然不满足于已经取得的成就，中国在前进道路上勇往直前，使我不得不表示钦佩。
    这次，以吴努总理为首的缅甸政府代表团和缅甸其他代表团来北京时，中国朋友们，各国的使节冒雨欢迎我们，我对此表示感谢。我特别感谢按照中国总理的安排，中国朋友们对我们无微不至的招待。
    最后，让我祝毛泽东主席，刘少奇主席，朱德委员长，周恩来总理，陈毅元帅，林彪元帅，贺龙元帅，罗瑞卿总参谋长，身体健康，精神愉快。
