This newspaper, Jinan, 9th: Shandong is currently engaged in a crash harvest of late autumn crops, striving to harvest each and every crop carefully and thoroughly, ensuring that every grain returns to the granary.

This year, Shandong's late autumn crop harvest area is larger than in any previous year. The main late autumn crops are sweet potatoes, soybeans, and corn. As of October 7th, corn has been basically harvested, soybeans are 41% harvested, and sweet potatoes are 8.5% dug up.

During the harvest, in addition to paying attention to timely harvesting, all localities emphasized careful and thorough harvesting, re-harvesting, and re-threshing, striving to harvest more grain. For example, in the Jining region's Zou County, Jinxiang, Sishui, Teng County, and Wenshang counties, more than 100,000 auxiliary laborers and students were organized to re-harvest and re-glean the several million mu of sweet potatoes, soybeans, corn, peanuts, and other crops that had already been harvested, one to two times each. The corn and peanut stalks that had already been harvested were also picked one by one, generally yielding an additional three to five jin of miscellaneous grains and twenty to thirty jin of sweet potatoes per mu. In Bicheng Commune, Gaomi County, in order to achieve thorough and careful harvesting, a system of "six fixes" (fixed leadership, fixed plots, fixed time, fixed tasks, fixed acceptance, fixed rewards and punishments) "four follows" (follow harvesting and digging, follow re-gleaning, follow weighing and recording work points, follow transportation), and "four picks" (pick missed plants and leaves, pick soybean pods from the ground, pick from under the carts, pick burst grains) was implemented. All localities paid more attention to the re-harvesting of sweet potatoes, generally re-harvesting once after digging, and re-harvesting again when plowing the land for autumn planting. In many areas, in order to ensure that the autumn harvest was refined and nothing was lost, specialized personnel were assigned to each type of work, and different harvesting methods were adopted according to different crops. For example, in Hualan Town Commune, Pingyin County, after digging sweet potatoes, a combination of collective and household contracting methods was adopted to slice and dry them, ensuring that they were sliced, dried, and stored as they were harvested and dug; corn stalks were harvested first, followed by the cobs; soybeans were harvested one piece at a time as they ripened, to prevent pod shattering. In the Baliwa Brigade of the Nanjiao Commune in Licheng County, during the sweet potato harvest, labor was rationally organized and divided into six processes: leaf picking, vine cutting, sweeping dry leaves, digging tubers, re-harvesting, and slicing and drying, all done in one go, bringing back all the primary and secondary products of the sweet potatoes.

Currently, in addition to continuing to harvest soybeans well, all localities in the province are mainly concentrating their efforts on a crash program to harvest, dig, and store sweet potatoes and peanuts, striving to harvest them carefully and thoroughly in a timely manner.

This newspaper, Zhengzhou, 9th: Henan Province's autumn harvest is progressing quickly and well. As of October 6th, 66% of the province's grain crops have been harvested; economic crops such as cotton and tobacco are also being harvested in large quantities. The three regions of Kaifeng, Nanyang, and Xinxiang, which are progressing rapidly, have harvested more than 80% of their early and late autumn grain crops. According to the characteristics of this year's autumn harvest in Henan, such as the large area of crops, the multiple intercropping and interplanting, the planting of small and scattered plots along "ten sides," and the early and late maturity periods due to several drought-resistant plantings and replantings in the same field, the harvesting time and labor have been rationally arranged, striving to ensure that every grain returns to the granary and that the seeds, leaves, stalks, and roots of the crops are all recovered.

This year's autumn harvest work in Henan Province has been very meticulous. Before the autumn harvest, all localities in the Kaifeng region organized cadres and experienced farmers to sum up the experience of careful harvesting and threshing in the past, and adopted different harvesting methods for various crops. For example, mung beans were harvested by picking the pods first and then cutting the plants; soybeans were harvested with sickles instead of shovels, and low stubble was left instead of high stubble; cotton harvesting promoted the "three, two, one" picking method of Huaiyang County (i.e., a group of six people, picking six ridges at a time, three people walking in front, two people picking the stiff petals on the plants in the middle, and one person re-harvesting the flowers on the plants in the back), selling as they were picked to reduce grading procedures; for small and scattered plots of intercropped and interplanted crops or those with uneven maturity periods, the method of harvesting one plant at a time when it ripens, harvesting one piece at a time when it ripens, and harvesting as it ripens was adopted. Labor was also rationally divided: women were responsible for cutting beans, picking cotton, and picking mung bean pods; male laborers were responsible for pulling, transporting, and threshing; auxiliary laborers and elementary school students picked cotton, picked sweet potato slices, re-gleaned dropped plants and grains, and crop stalks and leaves; cadres and experienced farmers judged the maturity period of crops and inspected the quality of harvesting and threshing while working. The Zhanglou Brigade of the Huanglong Commune in the suburbs of Kaifeng City had more than 1,200 mu of soybeans, originally planned to be harvested all at once after a large area matured. After appraisal, it was found that more than 240 mu in 18 plots matured four days earlier than the general fields, so they were immediately organized to harvest them quickly, avoiding pod bursting and grain dropping. Many communes and teams throughout the province also made scientific arrangements for harvesting time by utilizing climatic conditions, such as cutting beans and carrying beans in the morning when the weather was humid, cutting grain and carrying grain in the morning, and harvesting corn or threshing in the afternoon when the weather was dry. During the autumn harvest, all localities also paid attention to strengthening field management, adding mats and coverings to the stacks, and digging drainage ditches around the fields to ensure that they would not germinate or become moldy on rainy days.

Party organizations at all levels in Henan regarded ensuring the quality of the autumn harvest and organizing re-harvesting and re-threshing as the top priority in the autumn harvest, grasping it tightly, meticulously, and specifically. Party organizations at all levels universally carried out ideological education among commune members to cherish grain and strive for excellence in the autumn harvest, so that the vast majority of commune members generally established the concept of careful harvesting and threshing. In Qingfeng, Lin County, and seven other counties in the Xinxiang region, 170,000 autumn harvest troops launched a competition for careful harvesting and threshing with carrying bags for harvesting, baskets for transporting, and mats on the carts, greatly reducing the loss of grain due to scattering. The Shenqiu County Party Committee organized the masses to carry out a competition for careful threshing and harvesting during the autumn harvest, and in one day they re-picked 2,241 jin of cotton and 29,000 jin of beans.

Henan also paid attention to grasping difficult areas in the autumn harvest movement, prompting areas with slow autumn harvests and poor quality to catch up, ensuring a balance in the progress and quality of the autumn harvest throughout the province.

This newspaper, Tianjin, 9th: More than 30 million mu of late autumn crops in Hebei Province have matured one after another. People's communes in various places are carrying out crash harvesting and threshing while launching a shock to plant wheat, striving to form stubble early, sow wheat early, and complete the planting plan for expanding wheat in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way. According to incomplete statistics, as of October 5th, various late autumn crops harvested throughout the province have reached more than 10 million mu.

In order to avoid the encroachment of natural disasters such as wind and frost, and to clear the land for wheat sowing as soon as possible, various localities have launched a competition movement to seize every minute and second to grab time in the late autumn crop harvest. During the movement, various localities strengthened leadership and supplemented labor. Baoding County, which has a large number of late autumn crops, transferred 600,000 laborers to the crash harvest. According to the current situation of the universal maturity of late autumn crops and the expansion of the wheat planting area in the city, the Handan Municipal Party Committee widely promoted the experience of Xingxian Production Team of Shuguan Commune, Daming County, which simultaneously harvests seedlings, digs potatoes, transports manure, deep plows, sows, and harrows, greatly accelerating the progress of the autumn harvest and saving labor. The city's daily harvesting area increased from 950,000 mu at the end of September to 1.5 million mu. In Xushui County, a comprehensive crash autumn harvest centered on fast harvesting, fast transportation, fast threshing, fast drying, and fast storage was launched. The 16 communes in the county invested more than 200,000 laborers in the autumn harvest on the premise of ensuring the timely sowing of wheat. Up to now, more than 82% of the grain and oil crops in the county have been harvested, threshed, and stored.

During the crash harvest, all localities paid great attention to careful threshing and harvesting, striving to ensure that every grain returned to the granary. In Shijiazhuang City, during the crash harvest, 200,000 people were organized into specialized teams for harvesting, threshing, transporting, and gleaning according to the agricultural work procedures. The specialized teams cooperated with each other and worked in assembly line, making the autumn harvest work fast and good. The city has now completed the crash harvest of 90% of the mature crops, of which 85% of the harvested crops have been threshed and stored. In Fengrun County, during the crash harvest, measures such as ideological mobilization at all levels, formulation of careful harvesting and threshing regulations, organization of specialized teams for careful harvesting, formulation of careful harvesting reward methods, and secretaries at all levels carrying out careful harvesting experimental fields were adopted to accelerate the progress of the crash harvest and improve the quality of harvesting. According to incomplete statistics from various localities, more than 1 million people in the province formed more than 14,000 specialized teams for careful harvesting during the crash harvest movement.

This newspaper, Hohhot, 9th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region concentrated 3 million laborers and 170,000 cadres at all levels to carefully harvest and thresh large autumn crops. As of October 5th, 24 banners and counties in the region had basically completed the autumn harvest, and the harvesting progress and quality were faster and better than in previous years. At the same time, more than 20 million mu of arable land in the region have been autumn-plowed.

During the harvest, all localities universally implemented an inspection and acceptance system. When checking, the communes in Ningcheng County, Zhaowuda League, found that a few commune members had neglected the quality of harvesting, and immediately organized commune members to formulate a set of specific measures for careful harvesting and threshing, such as "four lights" (light cutting, light placing, light bundling, light transporting), "four cleans" (clean cutting, clean pulling, clean threshing, clean gleaning), and "four preventions" (preventing fire, preventing wind, preventing rain, and preventing trampling by livestock) by presenting facts and calculating detailed accounts, reversing the phenomenon of rough harvesting. The county also organized more than 5,200 auxiliary laborers to glean the autumn harvest, and has already picked up more than 30,000 jin of grain. In order to ensure that no ears of grain were lost and no grains were dropped, the commune members of Shantou Commune in this county ensured that they did not stop on the way to pick up grain, and transported corn with its husks to the field, and all the livestock participating in the autumn harvest were fitted with muzzles.

In order to carefully thresh and harvest, many communes arranged the harvesting order in advance: first harvest crops that are afraid of wind and frost, and first harvest remote plots and then harvest nearby plots. When bundling, small bundles, tight bundles, and bundling as they were cut were implemented. Jianhua People's Commune in Kailu County, Jerim League, found that some commune members used too much force when cutting sorghum, dropping up to 300 grains in each bundle, resulting in an average loss of more than one jin of grain per mu. They immediately proposed measures such as light cutting and light placing, placing the ears first and then the roots, preventing the dropping of sorghum grains. When harvesting potatoes in Ulanqab League, measures such as deep digging, digging through, picking cleanly, harrowing, and then cultivating were adopted, plus picking line by line and picking path by path, increasing the yield by about 40 jin of potatoes per mu.

After the first round of harvesting and threshing, all localities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region universally conducted careful inspection and acceptance. This year, the Xilingol League had more reclamation and a larger planting area. After the first round of harvesting and threshing, all banners and counties organized more than 50,000 people to re-harvest and re-thresh. Ulanqab League organized 140,000 auxiliary laborers to pick up grain and re-harvest and re-thresh. Many people's communes threshed and winnowed three or four times, until they were completely threshed and winnowed. In areas with severe rodent infestations, rodent extermination and digging of rat holes were also carried out to reduce grain loss.

    山东河南河北内蒙古细收秋粮
    本报济南9日电　山东各地正在突击抢收晚秋作物，力争样样作物收细收好，颗粒归仓。
    今年山东晚秋作物收获面积比过去任何一年都多。晚秋作物主要以甘薯、大豆、玉米等为大宗。到本月7日，玉米已基本收完，大豆收割41％，甘薯收刨8.5％。
    在抢收中，各地除注意掌握适时收割以外，特别强调精收细收，复收、复打，力争多收一些粮食。如济宁专区的邹县、金乡、泗水、滕县、汶上等五县，组织发动辅助劳力和学生十万多人，对已收获的几百万亩甘薯、大豆、玉米、花生等作物，逐块复收复拾一到二遍；对已收获的玉米、花生等秸秧也逐棵拣摘，一般每亩多收杂粮三至五斤，甘薯多收二十到三十斤。高密县柏城公社为了收净、收细，实行了六定（定领导、定地片、定时间、定任务、定验收、定奖惩）、四随（随收刨、随复拾、随过秤记工、随运）、四拣（拣漏掉棵叶、拣豆铺底、拣车底、拣爆粒）等制度。各地对甘薯的复收更为重视，一般都做到了收刨后复收一次，结合秋种耕刨地再复收一次。许多地区为使秋收精益求精，样样不丢，在劳力使用上采取了样样活路有专人负责和根据不同作物采取不同收获办法。如平阴县花兰店公社，收刨甘薯后，采取集体与分户包干相结合的办法切片晒干，做到随收刨、随切片、随晒干、随入仓；对玉米则先收秸，后收棒；对大豆采取熟一片收一片，预防掉荚爆粒。历城县南郊公社八里洼大队，在甘薯收刨中，合理组织劳力，分成摘叶、割秧、扫干叶、刨块、复收、切晒六道工序一气呵成的办法，把甘薯的正副产品全部收回来。
    目前全省各地除继续收好大豆外，主要是集中力量突击甘薯、花生的收刨贮存，力争及时精收细收。
    本报郑州9日电　河南省秋收工作又快又好。到10月6日为止，全省粮食作物已收66％；棉花、烟叶等经济作物也正大量收摘。进度快的开封、南阳、新乡三个专区，早晚秋粮食作物已收80％以上。河南各地根据今年秋收作物面积大，间作套种多，“十旁”零星小片种植多，和在一块地中由于几次抗旱播种补种、成熟期有早有晚等特点，合理安排了收割时间和劳力，力争颗粒归仓，把作物的籽、叶、秆、根全部收回。
    今年河南省的秋收工作作得十分细致。开封专区各地在秋收前就组织干部、老农总结了过去精收细打的经验，对各种作物采取了不同的收获办法。如绿豆实行先摘角后割棵的办法；大豆改铲收为镰收，改高茬为低茬；收棉花推广了淮阳县的“三、二、一”（即六人为一组，一次拾六垅，三人走在前，二人在中间拾棵上僵瓣花，一人在后复收棵上花）采摘法，随摘随售，减少了分级手续；对套种间作的小片零星地庄稼或成熟期不齐的，就采取熟一棵，收一棵，熟一片，收一片，随熟随收的办法。劳力也作了合理分工：妇女负责割豆子、摘棉花、摘绿豆角；男劳力负责拉、运、打场；辅助劳力和小学生拾棉花、拣甘薯片、复拾掉棵丢粒和作物秆叶；干部和有经验的老农边劳动边鉴定作物成熟期和验收收打质量。开封市郊黄龙公社张楼大队一千二百多亩大豆，原计划大片成熟后一齐收割，经过鉴定有二百四十多亩十八片比一般田提前四天成熟，便立即组织抢收，避免了炸角掉粒。全省许多社队，还利用气候条件科学安排收割时间，如趁早上天潮割豆担豆，上午割谷担谷，下午天干收玉米或打场。在秋收中，各地还注意加强场间管理，垛上加席加盖，场边挖排水沟，保证阴雨天不致生芽发霉。
    河南各级党的组织把保证秋收质量、组织复收、复打工作当成秋收中的头等重要任务，抓紧抓细抓具体。各级党组织普遍对社员进行了人人珍惜粮食，秋收精益求精的思想教育，使广大社员普遍树立了精收细打的观念。新乡专区清丰、林县等九个县，十七万秋收大军展开了收秋带包，运秋带篮，捆秋带包单，车上垫席的精收细收的竞赛，大大减少了粮食的抛撒损失。沈丘县委在秋收中组织群众开展精打细收竞赛，一天就复摘棉花二千二百四十一斤、豆子二万九千斤。
    河南在秋收运动中还注意抓困难地区，促使秋收慢、质量差的地区迎头赶上，保证了全省秋收进度和质量的平衡。
    本报天津9日电　河北省三千多亩晚秋收作物陆续成熟，各地人民公社在突击种麦的同时，正在进行抢收抢打，力争早成茬，早秋播，多快好省地完成扩大小麦的种植计划。据不完全统计，到10月5日为止，全省收获的各种晚秋作物已达一千多万亩。
    为了避免风霜等自然灾害侵袭，尽快地腾地播种小麦，各地在晚秋作物收获中开展了争分夺秒抢时间的竞赛运动。在运动中，各地加强了领导，充实了劳动力。晚秋作物较多的保定县，抽调了六十万名劳动力投入抢收。邯郸市委根据目前全市的晚秋作物已普遍成熟和扩大小麦播种面积的情况，在全市普遍推广了大名县束馆公社杏现生产队随割秧、随刨薯、随运粪、随深翻、随播种、随砘地的秋收种麦两不误的经验，大大加快了秋收进度，又节省了劳力。全市每天收割面积由9月底的九十五万亩提高到一百五十万亩。徐水县在抢收中全面开展了以快收、快运、快打、快晒、快入仓为中心的秋收大突击，全县十六个公社在保证小麦及时播种的前提下，以二十多万名劳力投入秋收，到现在全县已有82％以上的粮食和油料作物收打入仓。
    在抢收中，各地都十分注意精打细收，力争颗粒归仓。石家庄市在抢收中，按农活工序，由二十万人组成了收、打、运、拾的专业队，各专业队互相配合，流水作业，使秋收工作进行得又快又好。全市现已抢收完90％的成熟作物，其中打场入库的占已收割作物的85％。丰润县在抢收中，采取层层思想发动，制订精收细打规程，组织精收专业队，订出精收奖励办法以及各级书记搞精收试验田等办法，加快了抢收进度和提高了收割质量。各地不完全统计，全省在抢收运动中，有一百多万人组成了一万四千多个精收专业队。
    本报呼和浩特9日电　内蒙古自治区集中三百万劳动大军和十七万各级干部精收细打大秋作物。到10月5日，全区已有二十四个旗、县基本结束秋收，收获进度和质量比往年又快又好。同时，全区已有二千多万亩耕地进行了秋翻。
    在收获中，各地普遍推行了检查验收制度。昭乌达盟宁城县各公社检查时发现有少数社员有忽视收割质量的现象，立即组织社员通过摆事实算细账的办法，制订出“四轻”（轻割、轻放、轻捆、轻运）、“四净”（割净、拉净、打净、拾净）、“四防”（防火、防风、防雨、防牲畜糟蹋）等一整套精收细打的具体措施，扭转了收获粗糙的现象。全县还组织五千二百多名辅助劳力拾秋，已拾回粮食三万多斤。这个县的山头公社为切实作到不丢穗、不掉粒，社员们做到挑谷子途中不停、运玉米带皮进场，参加秋收的牲畜都带上箍咀。
    为了精打细收，许多公社都事先安排好收割顺序：先割怕风、怕冻的作物，先割远地块后割近地块。在捆码上作到小捆、捆紧和随割随捆。哲里木盟开鲁县建华人民公社发现有些社员割放高粱时用力太大，最多一捆摔掉三百多粒，平均每亩损失一斤多粮食，立即提出轻割轻放先放穗后放根等措施，杜绝了高粱掉粒的现象。乌兰察布盟在收获马铃薯时，采取深起、挖通、拾净、耙过然后耕耘的办法，再加上线线拾、道道捡，使每亩地多收回四十斤左右的马铃薯。
    内蒙古自治区各地在头遍收打后普遍进行了细致的检查验收。锡林郭勒盟今年开荒多，播种面积大，各旗、县在头遍收打后，又组织五万多人复收复打。乌兰察布盟组织十四万个辅助劳力捡粮和复收复打。不少人民公社打扬达到三、四遍，一直到打净扬光为止。鼠害严重的地区，还进行了灭鼠和挖鼠洞，减少粮食损失。
