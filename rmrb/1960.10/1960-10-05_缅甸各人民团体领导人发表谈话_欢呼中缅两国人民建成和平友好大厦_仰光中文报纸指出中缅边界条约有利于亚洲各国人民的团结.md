Xinhua News Agency report: Leaders of various people's organizations in Myanmar issued statements to the press here on the 3rd, warmly supporting the China-Myanmar Border Treaty and wishing the further consolidation of this edifice of China-Myanmar peace and friendship.

		Chairman of the Burmese Trade Union Congress, Tekin Lun, said: "The conclusion of the China-Myanmar Border Treaty allows the friendship between the people of China and Myanmar to be further consolidated. This historic event is a victory for the people of both countries."

		Tekin Lun said, "After the Chinese people were liberated, the imperialists, led by the United States, carried out provocations and divisive activities on the China-Myanmar border issue. However, their attempt failed."

		Tekin Lun said, "Burmese workers and the Burmese Trade Union Congress will continue to work to defend China-Myanmar friendship."

		Tekin La Zui, member of the Central Executive Committee of the Burmese Workers' Party and vice-chairman of the Burmese Trade Union Congress, said, "The China-Myanmar Border Treaty is a great and glorious treaty. This treaty consolidates the friendship between the people of our two countries and resolves the complex problems created by imperialism for a long time. Therefore, the people of Myanmar are extremely happy about the signing of this equal and friendly cooperation treaty."

		Du Meiwen, Secretary-General of the Myanmar Women's Solidarity Association, said that most countries in the world use war to solve border issues. However, now China and Myanmar have signed a border treaty in a spirit of peace and friendship. Therefore, Burmese women are extremely happy and proud of this.

		Wu Rui Piao, Chairman of the Yangon County Myanmar (World) Peace Committee, said that the long-pending China-Myanmar border issue has been satisfactorily resolved in a short period of time. For this, we cannot but cheer for the wise and far-sighted policies of our two governments. At the same time, this proves to the world that consultations based on equality can solve all complex international problems and promote the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

		Wu Danwei, Secretary-General of the Yangon County Myanmar Workers' Party, warmly supports and welcomes the China-Myanmar Border Treaty. He said, "The signing of the China-Myanmar Border Treaty is a victory for the people of China and Myanmar, a failure for the imperialists who conspire to undermine China-Myanmar friendship, and a victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."

Xinhua News Agency report: Chinese newspapers in Rangoon have published editorials, warmly congratulating the signing of the China-Myanmar Border Treaty and hailing it as a victory for the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Burmese people and a victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

		The Rangoon "People's Daily" said that with the signing of this treaty, the China-Myanmar border will become a border of peace and friendship. This treaty will bring the friendly relations between the two countries and the traditional kinship-like friendship between the people of the two countries to an unprecedented peak.

		The editorial emphasized that the signing of the China-Myanmar Border Treaty is a direct failure of the shameless slander of imperialism that China has abandoned its policy of peaceful coexistence.

		The editorial of "China Daily" said that the citizens of Beijing and Rangoon are happy about the signing of the China-Myanmar Border Treaty. The editorial said that the current visit of Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, and more than 300 members of the Myanmar delegation to China is also a rare event in the history of friendly exchanges between countries in the world. It said that this shows that the China-Myanmar friendship established after breaking free from the shackles of imperialism and achieving independence has entered a new stage.

		An article published by "China Business News" pointed out: The establishment of a China-Myanmar border of peace and friendship is in line with the wishes of the people of both countries and is conducive to the unity of the people of Asian countries, and will have a positive impact on world peace.

		The "New Yangon News" published an editorial pointing out: The signing of the China-Myanmar Border Treaty will bring the "Pauk-Phaw" and kinship-like friendship between the people of our two countries to a new peak, and will give a heavy blow to the American imperialists' conspiracy of provocation. The American imperialists are unwilling to accept the failure they have suffered in China, and are trying their best to carry out provocations, slanders and sabotage activities against China, and incite anti-China movements. However, this frenzied activity of American imperialism will never harm a hair of great China. On the contrary, it will further expose its true colors and place itself in an unfavorable position as an enemy of the people of all countries in the world.

    缅甸各人民团体领导人发表谈话
    欢呼中缅两国人民建成和平友好大厦
    仰光中文报纸指出中缅边界条约有利于亚洲各国人民的团结
    据新华社讯　缅甸各人民团体的领导人3日对这里的报界发表谈话，热烈支持中缅边界条约，并祝这座中缅和平和友好的大厦进一步巩固。
    缅甸工会大会主席德钦伦说：“中缅边界条约的缔结，使得中缅两国人民的友谊能够得到进一步的巩固。这个历史性的事件是两国人民的胜利。”
    德钦伦说，“在中国人民获得解放以后，以美国为首的帝国主义在中缅边界问题上进行了挑拨和分裂活动。但是，他们的企图是失败了。”
    德钦伦说：“缅甸工人和缅甸工会大会将继续努力来保卫中缅友好。”
    缅甸工人党中央执行委员会委员、缅甸工会大会副主席德钦拉最说，“中缅边界条约是一个伟大的光荣的条约。这个条约巩固我们两国人民之间的友谊，解决了帝国主义长期以来制造的复杂问题，因此，缅甸人民对于这个平等和友好合作的条约的签订极其感到高兴。”
    缅甸妇女团结协会总书记杜梅温说，世界上大部分国家用战争的手段解决边界问题。但是，现在中国和缅甸以和平和友好的精神，签订了边界条约。因此，缅甸妇女对这感到极其高兴和自豪。
    仰光县缅甸（世界）和平委员会主席吴瑞漂说，长期悬而未决的中缅边界问题已经在短短的时期内得到圆满的解决。为此我们不能不欢呼我们两国政府明智和具有远见的政策。同时，这向全世界证明，在平等基础上进行协商能够解决一切国际间复杂问题，并且促进和平共处五项原则的精神。
    仰光县缅甸工人党总书记吴丹韦热烈地拥护和欢迎中缅边界条约。他说，“中缅边界条约的签订是中缅两国人民的胜利，是阴谋破坏中缅友谊的帝国主义者的失败，也是和平共处五项原则的胜利”。
    据新华社讯　仰光中文报纸纷纷发表社论，热烈祝贺中缅边界条约的签订，并且欢呼这是中国人民和缅甸人民友好合作的胜利，是和平共处五项原则的胜利。
    仰光“人民报”说，随着这个条约的签订，中缅边界将成为一个和平与友好的边界。这个条约将使两国的友好关系和两国人民传统的亲戚般的友谊达到空前的高峰。
    社论强调说，中缅边界条约的签订，是帝国主义胡说中国放弃了和平共处政策的无耻诽谤的直接失败。
    “中国日报”的社论说，北京和仰光的市民对中缅边界条约的签订感到高兴。社论说，目前吴努总理、奈温将军和三百多人的缅甸各代表团访问中国，也是世界各国友好往来的历史上少有的事件。它说，这都表明在摆脱帝国主义桎梏而取得独立以后建立起来的中缅友好关系已经进入了一个新阶段。
    “中国商报”发表的文章指出：中缅和平和友好的边界的建立，是符合两国人民的愿望的，而且有利于亚洲各国人民的团结，并将对世界和平产生良好的影响。
    “新仰光报”发表社论指出：中缅边界条约的签订将使我们两国人民之间的“胞波”和亲戚般的友谊达到一个新的高峰，并将给予美帝国主义的挑拨阴谋以沉重的打击，美帝国主义不甘心在中国所遭受的失败，正在想尽办法对中国进行挑衅、诽谤和破坏活动，并且煽动反对中国的运动。但是，美帝国主义的这种疯狂活动决计损害不了伟大中国的一根毫毛，相反地将进一步暴露它的真面目，使自己处于世界各国人民的敌人这样的不利地位。
