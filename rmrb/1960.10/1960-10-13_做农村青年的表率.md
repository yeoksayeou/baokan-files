　　Be a Role Model for Rural Youth
　　“Like father, like son” is a common saying in our country. In past legends and on today's stage, there are many stories about this, depicting the heroic images of fathers and sons across generations.
　　However, to truly appreciate outstanding figures, one must look to the present. During our country's revolutionary war period and socialist construction period, there are countless stories of "like father, like son" heroes! The exemplary deeds of the cadres in Baode County, Shanxi Province, and their children are a microcosm of this.
　　To have a son become a "hero," the "father" must first have heroic actions. For one's children to be content with agricultural production, parents must first have a sufficient understanding of the significance of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and have "heroic" performances in their actions. Otherwise, they will not be able to conduct correct education for their children; even if they talk about the principles of vigorously developing agriculture, it will not have the desired effect because their words and actions are inconsistent. Many veteran cadres in Baode County became "heroes" in the struggle against the enemy during the revolutionary war; in the vigorous development of agriculture, they took the lead in waging war against nature and became "heroes" on the agricultural front. These heroic actions of theirs set a shining example for the next generation. They also used their past heroic deeds to educate their children to love the countryside and agricultural labor, so that more than one hundred cadres' children were content to farm and became "heroes" on the agricultural front.
　　This practice of the cadres in Baode County is worth greatly promoting. Educating family members about vigorously developing agriculture can not only make one's children content with farming, but also have a great impact on the masses, forming a social atmosphere where everyone loves agricultural labor. We should learn from the cadres in Baode, first become "heroes" in vigorously developing agriculture ourselves, and at the same time educate our children to become "heroes" in vigorously developing agriculture.

    做农村青年的表率
    “老子英雄儿好汉”，是我国的一句俗话。过去的传说中，今天的舞台上，都有许多这方面的故事，描绘那些父子两代的英雄形象。
    但是，数风流人物还看今朝。在我国革命战争时期和社会主义建设时期，这种“老子英雄儿好汉”的故事，何止千万！山西保德县的干部和他们子女的模范事迹，就是这方面的一个缩影。
    要儿子成为“好汉”，“老子”首先要有英雄的行为。要自己的子女安心农业生产，家长对大办农业大办粮食的意义，首先要有足够的认识，并在行动中有“英雄”的表现。否则，就不能对子女进行正确的教育；即如讲一些大办农业的道理，由于自己言行不一，也不会起到应有效果。保德县的许多老干部，在革命战争中，成为对敌斗争的“英雄”；在大办农业中，他们又带头向自然开战，成为农业战线上的“英雄”。他们的这些英雄行为，给下一代树立了光辉榜样。他们还用过去的英雄事迹，教育自己的子女热爱农村，热爱农业劳动，使得一百多名干部子女安心务农，成为农业战线上的“好汉”。
    保德县干部的这种作法，值得大大提倡。干部对家属进行大办农业的教育，不仅能使自己的子弟安心务农，在群众中也会起到极大的影响，形成人人热爱农业劳动的风尚。我们应该向保德的干部学习，自己首先成为大办农业的“英雄”，同时教育子女成为大办农业的“好汉”。
