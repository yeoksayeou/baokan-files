Sichuan Reforms Tools, Early Rice Harvest Completed Ahead of Schedule / Guangxi Harvests Mid-Season Rice, Strictly Preventing Waste

Jiangxi Strives to Harvest All Early Autumn Crops Well / Qinghai Begins Harvesting Late Autumn Crops

Ningxia Qianjin Commune Successfully Plants Rice on Large Areas of Albic Soil

(Reported by our newspaper from Chengdu on the 5th) The tens of millions of mu of mid-season rice in Sichuan Province have been basically harvested and threshed. During the harvest, various localities have thoroughly carried out the production increase and economy campaign, resulting in rapid progress and good quality in harvesting.

Various localities concentrated their superior labor force on the front line of harvesting, and made reasonable arrangements for the labor force, so that everyone could play their greatest role. According to surveys in Nanchong, Neijiang, Mianyang and other places, a standard laborer averages about 300 jin of grain threshed per day (including cutting the grain), exceeding the standards of previous years.

The masses in various places have successfully created many new tools in the autumn harvest. In terms of threshing alone, there are Mianyang County's "Model 60 Thresher," Yibin County's "Waterwheel-Type Thresher," Nanbu County's "Chain Thresher," Peng'an County's "Single-Person Thresher," Dianjiang County's "Hand-Crank Thresher," and so on.

(Xinhua News Agency, Nanning) Guangxi has fully begun harvesting mid-season rice. As of September 25, according to preliminary statistics from the four special districts of Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning, and Baise, more than 1.5 million mu have been harvested.

Mid-season rice is the main grain crop in Guangxi. From the beginning of spring to the beginning of July, there had been no significant rain in the region. Although affected by such a severe drought, commune members in various places relied on the great strength of the People's Commune to fight drought and rush planting, and strengthened field management. Most areas have achieved three cultivations and three topdressings. Now, in the rush harvest, all localities are paying attention to careful harvesting and threshing, striving to bring every grain into the barn.

(Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang) Jiangxi is concentrating on rushing to harvest early autumn crops, striving to harvest all early autumn crops well, not losing a single grain, and increasing production and income.

Jiangxi Province's early autumn crops mainly include single-season late rice, miscellaneous grains, and economic crops such as cotton, hemp, and oilseeds. In the rush harvest, various localities are also generally paying attention to improving the quality of the harvest, striving to increase production and income for all crops. For example, Yichun Special District, when harvesting grain, cotton, and oilseed crops, has grasped the five major links of harvesting, threshing, drying, transportation, and storage, and organized competitions between communes and teams to improve the overall quality of the harvest. Tonggu, Yifeng and other counties have also launched a competition for careful harvesting and fine threshing, with the aim of clean harvesting, clean threshing, and clean picking. As a result, the various crops harvested have generally seen very little waste.

(Xinhua News Agency, Xining) Grain crops such as millet and buckwheat, replanted in the southeastern region of Qinghai Province, are gradually maturing. Counties such as Jianzha, Minhe, and Xunhua have begun harvesting.

Qinghai Province is located at a higher altitude and has a shorter frost-free period. In the past, only a few areas replanted some vegetables or fodder after harvesting spring wheat, and rarely replanted grain crops. This year, due to the deep-rooted idea of vigorously developing grain production, areas with warmer climates have actively replanted grain crops after the wheat harvest. For example, the area of grain replanted in Jianzha County reached about 40% of the county's wheat harvest area.

(Reported by our newspaper from Yinchuan on the 5th) The Hui and Han commune members of the Qianjin People's Commune in Pingluo County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, are full of joy as they harvest rice on albic soil for the first time. Albic soil is a white, hard, alkaline soil with a smooth, cracked surface where nothing grows. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Salt and Alkali Soil Improvement Experimental Station of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Agricultural Science Institute has successfully grown rice on albic soil for years of trials, ending the history of albic soil being unusable. This year, the Qianjin People's Commune has reclaimed nearly 3,000 mu of albic soil, planting 2,000 mu of rice in addition to dry crops such as wheat, flax, sorghum, corn, and various melons and vegetables.

Before sowing, the Qianjin Commune carried out deep plowing and soil loosening, and implemented small-plot planting during sowing; after sowing, it frequently drained and changed the water. Due to the comprehensive adoption of the successful measures of the agricultural experimental station, the rice planted on albic soil finally yielded a harvest. (Picture attached)

    适时细收多收粮食
    四川改革工具中稻提早收完　广西割中稻严防抛撒
    江西力争早秋作物样样收好　青海开镰收晚秋作物
    宁夏前进公社在白僵土上大面积试种水稻成功
    本报成都5日电　四川省的几千万亩中稻已基本收打完毕。收打中，各地深入开展增产节约运动，因而收打进度快，质量好。
    各地都集中优势劳力到收打第一线，并对劳力进行合理安排，使人人都能发挥最大作用。据南充、内江、绵阳等地的调查，一个标准劳力平均每天打谷三百斤左右（包括割谷），超过了往年的标准。
    各地群众在秋收中成功地创造了许多新工具，仅脱粒方面就有绵阳县的“60型打谷机”、宜宾县的“车水式打谷机”、南部县的“链条打谷机”、蓬安县的“单人打谷机”、垫江县的“手扳打谷机”等等。
    据新华社南宁讯　广西全面开镰收割中稻。到9月25日止，据桂林、柳州、南宁、百色等四个专区初步统计，已收割一百五十多万亩。
    中稻是广西粮食作物的大头。入春以来直到7月初，全区一直没有下过透雨。虽然受到这样严重干旱的影响，但是各地社员依靠人民公社的巨大力量抗旱抢插，加强田间管理，大部分地区都做到了三耘草三追肥。现在，各地在抢收中，都注意细打细收，力争颗粒归仓。
    据新华社南昌讯　江西各地突击抢收早秋作物，力争早秋作物样样收好，颗粒不丢，增产增收。
    江西省的早秋作物主要包括一季晚稻、杂粮和棉、麻、油料等经济作物。各地在抢收中还普遍注意提高收获质量，力争各项作物做到增产增收。如宜春专区在收获粮棉和油料作物的时候，抓住了收、打、晒、运、藏五大环节，组织社与社、队与队之间开展评比竞赛，使收获质量普遍提高。铜鼓、宜丰等县也因开展了以收净、打净和拣净为内容的精收细打竞赛，结果抢收的各项作物一般都抛撒极少。
    新华社西宁讯　青海省东南部地区复种的糜子、荞麦等粮食作物陆续成熟，尖扎、民和、循化等县已开镰收割。
    青海省地势较高，无霜期较短，以前只有少数地区在春小麦收割后复种一些蔬菜或饲料，极少复种粮食作物。今年由于大办粮食的思想深入人心，气候较暖地区在麦收后都积极复种粮食作物，如尖扎县复种的粮食达到全县麦收面积的40％左右。
    本报银川5日电　宁夏回族自治区平罗县前进人民公社回汉族社员，正满怀喜悦心情第一次在白僵土上收获水稻。白僵土是一种白色坚硬的碱化土壤，表面平滑，呈龟裂状，寸草不生。1958年大跃进以来，宁夏回族自治区农业科学研究所盐碱土壤改良试验站，在白僵土上连年试种水稻获得成功，结束了白僵土不能开发利用的历史。今年，前进人民公社开垦白僵土地近三千亩，除种植水稻二千亩外，还种了小麦、胡麻、高粱、玉米等旱作物和各种瓜、菜。
    前进公社在播种前，进行了深翻松土，播种时又实行了小畦种植；播种后勤排换水。由于全面采取了农业试验站成功的措施，终于使种在白僵土上的水稻有了收成。（附图片）
