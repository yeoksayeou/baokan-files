Xinhua News Agency, 29th — The technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, which has been vigorously carried out on the industrial, transportation, financial and trade, and capital construction fronts since last winter, has achieved extremely brilliant results.

This movement was launched under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction. The movement experienced a phase of rapid and vigorous development before April, and since May it has entered a phase of summarizing, consolidating, promoting, and improving the results of innovation. At present, the movement is still developing in a more in-depth, detailed, and widespread direction. But judging from this year alone, the movement has achieved the following ten major achievements:

	(1) Greatly improved the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in national industrial production was only about 30% at the end of last year, but it has now increased to about 50%. In departments such as short-distance transportation, loading and unloading, construction, mining, crushing, forging, packaging, sewing, and cooking, many workers have discarded backward tools such as hammers, axes, carrying poles, and baskets, and have been freed from heavy manual labor and tedious manual operations. At the same time, thousands of automated production lines or interconnected lines, and tens of thousands of automated or semi-automated machines have appeared, and even some fully automated, continuous workshops or factories, and unmanned substations have emerged. For example, a dozen dyeing factories in Shanghai have achieved continuous production. In the past, workers standing next to high-temperature cloth-boiling pots to swing the cloth, now sit comfortably on the central control panel. At the touch of a button, the machine starts running, and a piece of white cloth, like a dragon emerging from the sea, travels around the factory, automatically dyeing, automatically printing, and automatically heading to the finished product packaging workshop, ready to be packed and shipped. Seeing this scene, the workers were overjoyed and cheered: This is another liberation!

	(2) A large number of new technologies, new processes, and new experiences have been adopted and created. Central industrial and transportation departments alone have identified more than 200 major new technologies, new processes, and new experiences that have been tested and promoted nationwide. These include iron smelting technology with fine materials, high blast volume, and high temperature, machining processes with no or little cutting, hydraulic coal mining, and advanced experiences such as four-in-one ring power supply. In this year's technical innovation and technical revolution movement, new technologies, new processes, or new experiences have been adopted and promoted in many types of work and procedures from mining, smelting, machining, chemical industry, electric power, construction, light industry to transportation and even service industries, thereby continuously improving the level of production technology in our country.

	(3) Labor productivity has been greatly improved, and labor has been saved. According to preliminary statistics, the labor productivity of workers in nationally independent accounting industrial enterprises in the first half of the year increased by several tens of percent compared with the same period last year, and the growth rate exceeded any previous year. According to statistics from eleven provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, the labor force saved by industrial enterprises in the first half of the year reached 1.3 million people, of which 220,000 were transferred from their original enterprises. Many enterprises have not only achieved increased production without increasing personnel, but also increased production while reducing personnel.

	(4) Increased production capacity and increased product output. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the production capacity of many machines, equipment, workshops, and even some factories has been doubled, tripled, or even more. For example, in the machinery system of Shenyang, more than 65% of the machine tools have become "multi-treasure machine tools" (that is, several innovation measures have been adopted on one machine tool), and production efficiency has generally increased by more than double. Among the eighty-seven heavy industrial factories in Putuo District, Shanghai, sixty have achieved one factory being equivalent to two or more than three factories. Even large factories producing high-end products such as the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory have seen their production capacity double, although the state has not increased investment or materials for these enterprises.

	(5) Created a large number of new products. In just a few months, the two cities of Shanghai and Tianjin alone have successfully trial-produced more than 20,000 new products. Among the successfully trial-produced new products, many are high-end, precision products, or scarce products. For example, 50,000-volt high-voltage electric bridges, miniature cars, and rice transplanters are products that have not been produced domestically in the past. At the same time, many new varieties have also appeared in steel, chemical industry, and light industry.

	(6) Improved product quality. Due to the creation and application of new technologies, new processes, and new experiences, the quality of many products has been improved. For example, old products in the machinery industry have been or are being reformed to varying degrees, either reducing weight, improving efficiency, or making them easier to use. For example, the quality of converter steel in the metallurgical industry, some medicines and rubber products in the chemical industry, and some high-end textiles and knitwear in the textile industry have all been improved to varying degrees in technical innovation.

	(7) Created broader avenues for saving raw materials, creating new materials, and utilizing waste materials. Since this year, the departments that use the most steel, coal, and wood have achieved outstanding results in this area. In the machinery industry, because many products have greatly reduced in size and weight while maintaining their original performance, a lot of raw materials can be saved. According to statistics from more than 30 design units under the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Ministry of Coal Industry, etc., projects designed using new technologies can generally save 20% or even several tens of percent of steel, wood, and cement. The construction department has also successfully trial-produced a variety of new materials such as gypsum slag cement, lightweight aggregates, and non-metallic pipes. Most of these new materials are made from waste materials. In addition, all walks of life have carried out the comprehensive utilization of coal, wood, and agricultural products. In places where coal gasification is promoted, coal savings are generally around 20%. In small, indigenous chemical production units run by people's communes in cities such as Harbin and Jilin, hundreds of chemical products are manufactured using waste gas, waste liquid, and waste residue from large factories.

	(8) Promoted the improvement of enterprise management. The development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is the result of the continuous adjustment of production relations and the improvement of enterprise management in the past two years, and the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement requires continued improvement of production relations and continued improvement of enterprise management. During this period, many enterprises have better implemented the Party's policy of putting politics in command, centralized leadership and combining mass movements, the policy of walking on two legs of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and have implemented and developed the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" system, raising our enterprise management work to a new height. At the same time, some places have also carried out reforms in management tools. For example, a large number of management machines have appeared in enterprises in cities such as Mudanjiang and Harbin. These machines replace the tedious manual operations in past calculations, experiments, and other work.

	(9) Enriched and developed certain technical and scientific theories. In this technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the broad masses of employees have fully demonstrated with many vivid examples that scientific theory comes from labor practice, and labor practice can continuously develop and enrich past technical theories. For example, in departments such as the metallurgical industry, textile industry, and chemical industry, new technical and scientific theories that were not present in past technical theories have been proposed.

	(10) Greatly promoted the communist spirit of the broad masses of employees. In this technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the broad masses of employees liberated their minds, broke superstitions, and promoted the spirit of daring to think, daring to act, and continuous revolution, breaking all the shackles of outdated technical theories and old ideas on them. They said: The working people have two hands, and they can have everything if they liberate their minds. They used this revolutionary spirit and great ambition to work day and night in the field of technical innovation and technical revolution, paving the way for the Great Leap Forward. Many employees not only carried out innovation themselves, but also enthusiastically helped others to carry out innovation. They said: One flower is not spring, a riot of color is spring; leave the difficulties to yourself, and give the convenience to others. They went everywhere to pass on their experiences and promote innovation, and greatly promoted the spirit of collaboration, helping each other solve problems.

From the above achievements, the mass movement of vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution has and is fully mobilizing the enthusiasm, creativity, and potential power within the industry. This is not only a reliable guarantee for fully completing and overfulfilling this year's national plan without increasing the labor force, without increasing more equipment and investment, but more importantly, it has found a path to develop our country's industry at a high speed and rapidly improve our country's scientific and technological level with greater, faster, better, and more economical results under the specific conditions of our country. This path is of extremely significant and far-reaching significance for our country to implement the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, basing the national economy on agriculture, and realizing a comprehensive and sustained Great Leap Forward.

    技术革命——多快好省发展工业的道路
    全国工业生产机械化半机械化程度提高百分之二十
    十一个省、市、自治区的工业企业上半年节约劳动力一百三十万人
    经过试用在全国推广的重大新技术、新工艺和新经验达二百多种
    新华社29日讯　工业、交通、财贸和基本建设战线上，自去年冬天以来蓬勃开展的、以机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动，取得了极其辉煌的成就。
    这一运动是在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下开展起来的。运动经历了在4月以前的急风骤雨的大发展的阶段，自5月以来又进入了总结、巩固、推广、提高革新成果的阶段。目前，运动仍在沿着更加深入、细致和更加普及的方向发展。但仅就今年的情况看来，运动已经取得了以下十大成绩：
      （一）大大地提高了机械化和半机械化的水平。全国工业生产的机械化、半机械化程度，在去年年底只有30％左右，目前已经提高到了50％左右。在短途运输、装卸、建筑、采掘、破碎、铸锻、包装、缝纫、炊事等部门中，许多工人丢掉了锤子、斧子、扁担、箩筐等落后工具，摆脱了笨重的体力劳动和繁琐的手工操作。与此同时，还出现了数以千计的自动化生产线或联动线，和数以万计的自动化或半自动化的机械，甚至还出现了一些全部自动化、连续化的车间或工厂，无人值班的变电所等。如上海市就有十来个印染厂实现了连续化生产。过去站在高温煮布锅旁边甩布的工人，现在轻松地坐在中央操纵台上，一按电钮，机器转动起来，一条白布就像蛟龙出海一样，环游全厂，自动染色，自动印花，自动奔向成品包装车间，打包待运。看到这种情景，广大工人兴高采烈，欢呼：这是又一次解放！
      （二）大量地采用和创造了新技术、新工艺和新经验。只中央各工业、交通部门，经过试用、鉴定在全国推广的重大的新技术、新工艺和新经验就达二百多种。其中包括精料、大风、高温的炼铁技术，无切削或少切削的机械加工工艺，水力采煤，四合一环形供电的先进经验等。在今年的技术革新和技术革命运动中，从采掘、冶炼、机械加工、化工、电业、建筑、轻工到交通运输甚至服务性行业的许多工种和工序都采用和推广了新技术、新工艺或新经验，从而使我国生产技术水平不断地提高。
      （三）大大地提高了劳动生产率，节约了劳动力。据初步统计，上半年全国独立核算的工业企业工人劳动生产率比去年同期增长了百分之几十，增长速度超过以往任何一年。另据十一个省、市、自治区的统计，上半年工业企业节约的劳动力达一百三十万人，其中调离原企业的即有二十二万人。许多企业不仅作到了增产不增人而且作到了增产还减人。
      （四）提高了生产能力，增加了产品产量。在技术革新、技术革命运动中，许多机器设备、车间，甚至一些工厂的生产能力作到了一顶二、一顶三，甚至更多。如沈阳市机械系统，有65％以上的机床成了“多宝机床”（即一台机床上采用了几项革新措施），生产效率普遍提高一倍以上。上海市普陀区八十七家重工业工厂中，有六十家实现了一个厂顶两个厂到三个以上的厂。就是像哈尔滨量具刃具厂等这样生产高级产品的大工厂，生产能力也是成倍地提高，虽然国家并没有给这些企业增加投资或材料。
      （五）创制了大量新产品。在短短的几个月中，只上海和天津两市，试制成功的新产品就达二万种以上。试制成功的新产品中，有不少是高级、精密的产品，或稀缺的产品。如五万伏的高压电桥、微型汽车、水稻插秧机等，就是过去国内没有生产过的产品。同时，在钢和化工、轻工业中也出现了许多新的品种。
      （六）提高了产品的质量。由于创造和运用了新技术、新工艺和新经验，不少产品的质量都有提高。如机械工业中的老产品，都已经进行了或正在进行着不同程度的改革，或减轻了重量，或提高了效能，或者使用更方便了。又如冶金工业中的转炉钢，化学工业中的一些医药和橡胶制品，纺织工业中的一些高级纺织品和针织品等的质量，都在技术革新中有了不同程度的提高。
      （七）为节约原料材料，创造新材料，利用废弃物资开辟了更加宽广的途径。今年以来，使用钢铁、煤炭、木材最多的部门，在这方面的成绩都很突出。机械工业由于许多产品在原有性能不变的条件下，大大缩小了体积，减轻了重量，因而可以节约不少原料材料。据建筑工程部、煤炭工业部等所属三十多个设计单位的统计，采用新技术设计的项目，一般可节约钢材、木材、水泥20％甚至好几十。建筑部门还试制成功了石膏矿渣水泥、轻质骨料和非金属管材等多种新型材料。这些新材料大多是用废弃物资作成的。此外，各行各业都开展了煤炭、木材和农产品的综合利用。在推行煤气化的地方，一般节约煤炭20％左右。在哈尔滨、吉林等城市人民公社办的小型、土法生产的化工单位中，有几百种化工产品是利用大厂的废气、废液、废渣等制造出来的。
      （八）促进了企业管理工作的改进。技术革新和技术革命运动的开展，是过去两年不断调整生产关系和改进企业管理的结果，而技术革新、技术革命运动的开展，又要求继续改善生产关系，继续改进企业管理。在这期间，许多企业都更好地贯彻执行了党的政治挂帅，集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针，土洋并举的两条腿走路的方针，并贯彻和发展了“两参一改三结合”的制度，使我们的企业管理工作提高到了更新的高度。同时，有些地方还进行了管理工具的改革。如牡丹江、哈尔滨等城市的企业中，都出现了大量的管理机具。这些机具代替了过去计算、试验等工作中繁琐的手工操作。
      （九）丰富和发展了某些技术科学理论。在这一次的技术革新和技术革命运动中，职工群众用许多生动的事例充分证明：科学理论来源于劳动实践，劳动实践可以不断地发展和丰富过去的技术理论。如在冶金工业、纺织工业和化学工业等部门中，都提出了过去技术理论中还没有过的新的技术科学理论。
      （十）大大发扬了广大职工群众的共产主义风格。在这一次的技术革新和技术革命运动中，广大职工群众解放思想，破除迷信，发扬了敢想敢干和不断革命的精神，打破了一切陈腐的技术理论和旧观点旧思想对他们的束缚。他们说：劳动人民一双手，解放思想样样有。他们就用这样的革命精神和雄心大志，废寝忘食地在技术革新和技术革命的领域里，为大跃进开辟道路。许许多多的职工群众，不仅自己搞革新，而且热情地帮助别人搞革新。他们说：一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红才是春；把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人。他们到处去传经送宝，推广革新经验，并且大兴协作之风，互相帮助解决问题。
    从上述成绩看来，大搞技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，已经和正在把广大职工的积极性、创造性以及工业内部的潜在力量充分地调动起来。这样作，不仅仅是找到了在不增加劳动力、不增加更多的设备和投资的条件下，全面完成和超额完成今年国家计划的可靠保证，更重要的是找到了一条在我国具体条件下，高速度地发展我国工业、迅速提高我国科学技术水平的多快好省的道路。这条道路对于我国贯彻执行工业与农业同时并举、国民经济以农业为基础的方针，实现全面持续的大跃进，有着极其重大而深远的意义。（附图片）
