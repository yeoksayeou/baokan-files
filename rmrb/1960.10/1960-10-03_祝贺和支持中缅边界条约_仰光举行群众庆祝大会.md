The rapid resolution of this complex historical issue was achieved through magnanimity, foresight, and in the spirit of mutual concessions and friendly consultation. In particular, it is due to the sincere and friendly attitude of Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China, as well as Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win of the Union of Burma."
    Sao Kun Hkio emphasized, "The resolution of the Sino-Burmese border treaty centrally reflects the common desire of the Chinese and Burmese people for peaceful coexistence and greatly strengthens the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by our two countries. Therefore, the friendly relations between our two countries have entered a new era."

It has set a successful example for resolving boundary issues and outstanding international issues, and also set an example for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. We firmly believe that the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty and the development of Sino-Burmese friendship will have an increasingly significant impact in Asia and the world."
