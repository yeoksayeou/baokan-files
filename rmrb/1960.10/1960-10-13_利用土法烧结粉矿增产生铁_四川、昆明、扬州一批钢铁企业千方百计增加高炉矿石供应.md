Sichuan, Kunming, Yangzhou a Batch of Steel Enterprises are Doing Everything Possible to Increase Blast Furnace Ore Supply

    This newspaper reports that in order to increase steel production, Sichuan Province's steel enterprises, while focusing on increasing ore production and transportation, are also vigorously engaged in washing, beneficiating, and sintering fine ore, turning large quantities of previously discarded fine ore into high-grade sintered ore. According to statistics up to the end of September, the province has utilized approximately 200,000 tons of fine ore, adding a large amount of "refined grain" to blast furnace production.
    In the process of ore transportation, crushing, and screening before entering the furnace, a large amount of fine ore is produced. In the increase production and conservation campaign, Sichuan Province's steel enterprises have regarded the utilization of fine ore as an important measure to ensure the completion of steel production increase plans. Leading cadres of each enterprise personally took charge, adopting a method that combines the organization of professional teams with vigorously launching mass movements, enabling the utilization of fine ore to develop rapidly. In the process of utilizing fine ore, they adhered to the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay," adapting to local conditions and making full use of various favorable conditions. Chongqing, Leshan, Mianyang, and other places have widely promoted the flat ground sintering method, which is not restricted by terrain and does not require iron pots. If there is no blower, it can be replaced with an earthen bellows. Due to the simplicity and ease of promotion of the method, units in Chongqing alone utilized more than 45,000 tons of fine ore in just over a month.
    After the Sichuan Province's steel enterprises utilized fine ore, the continuous leap forward in pig iron production has been more fully guaranteed due to the addition of high-grade "refined grain." After the fine ore at Xiaonanhai Iron Plant was sintered, the iron content increased by 5%-10%, increasing pig iron production by about 20% and saving about 10% of coke. At the same time, due to the high alkalinity and strong desulfurization ability of the sintered ore, the quality of pig iron was also greatly improved, with the qualification rate reaching over 90%. Sintered ore currently utilized by Leshan Steel Plant accounts for more than 70% of the plant's total ore consumption.
    Based on the production, transportation, and use of ore, Sichuan Province leaves behind tens of thousands of tons of fine ore every day. Currently, the province utilizes more than 3,000 tons of fine ore every day. They are determined to further engage in washing, beneficiating, and sintering fine ore to fully utilize these fine ores.

    This newspaper reports that Kunming No. 2 Steel Plant is vigorously engaged in fine ore sintering, with significant results. The cost of fine ore is half that of raw ore, and the quality meets the requirements of blast furnace smelting. Currently, sintered ore roasted from fine ore accounts for more than 35% of the plant's ore supply.
    Since the beginning of this year, the utilization coefficient of Kunming No. 2 Steel Plant's blast furnaces has continued to increase, and the demand for ore has greatly increased. After studying this situation, the plant leaders believed that in addition to increasing ore production, continuing to utilize a large amount of fine ore existing in the plant and vigorously engaging in sintering was a very good method. Initially, the output of fine ore sintering was relatively low. Plant leaders mobilized the workers to summarize the experience of previous sintering, and at the same time, sent people to fraternal plants to learn. Repeated experiments and improvements were made in terms of furnace type, batching, raw material processing, and sintering operations, finally sintering out sintered ore that meets the requirements of blast furnaces, promoting the increase in blast furnace production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, reports that the staff and workers of Lingyanshan Steel Plant in Yangzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are making full use of fine ore and coke breeze, vigorously engaging in fine ore sintering, saving more than 30% of iron ore. The utilization coefficient of blast furnaces has increased significantly, the coke ratio has decreased by an average of 21%, the qualification rate of pig iron has remained above 90%, and the cost per ton of iron has also been reduced by about 50 yuan, showing a new situation of comprehensive leap forward with high quality, high output, low consumption, and low cost.
    Starting from June last year, the workers of this plant built an earthen brick long kiln to sinter fine ore in order to utilize fine ore and coke breeze and reduce the cost of pig iron. Then, it was improved many times. In March this year, the plant's three blast furnaces were put into production at the same time, and after the blast furnaces were technically transformed, their appetite became larger and larger, and they had to eat refined and fine materials. In response to this situation, the factory party committee mobilized the masses to promptly process the fine ore and coke breeze stored in the factory, improve the output and quality of fine ore sintering, and ensure that the blast furnaces are well-fed. All the staff and workers actively responded to the call of the party committee, and did everything possible to besiege the fine ore sintering process. The party committee specially sent the deputy secretary of the party committee and the deputy director of the factory to discuss with the workers in the raw material workshop, absorbed the experience of multi-nozzle combustion on the blast furnace, and created the "flat ground multi-nozzle sintering method," which can make twelve sintering kilns burn at the same time, and the output has increased sharply. The amount of sintered ore entering the furnace in the second half of this year has remained above 50%, an increase of 78% over the second half of last year. In the process of innovating the sintering kiln, spiral ore washers and washing pools were also created, reducing the impurity content of fine ore and stabilizing the iron content of sintered ore at over 50%.

    利用土法烧结粉矿增产生铁
    四川、昆明、扬州一批钢铁企业千方百计增加高炉矿石供应
    本报讯　四川省钢铁企业为了多增产钢铁，在狠抓矿石增产和调运的同时，大搞粉矿洗、选、烧结，使大批原来弃置未用的粉矿变成了含铁品位高的烧结矿。据到9月末的统计，全省已利用了粉矿约二十万吨，为高炉生产增加了大批“细粮”。
    在矿石倒运、破碎直到入炉前筛选的过程中，会产生大量粉矿。四川省各钢铁企业在增产节约运动中，把利用粉矿当作保证完成钢铁增产计划的重要措施之一。各企业领导干部亲自挂帅，采取组织专业队伍和大搞群众运动相结合的办法，使利用粉矿的工作迅速开展起来。在利用粉矿的过程中，他们坚持“土洋并举，以土为主”的方针，因地制宜，就地取材，充分利用各种有利条件。重庆、乐山、绵阳等地普遍推行了平地烧结的方法，既不受地形限制，也不需要铁锅，没有鼓风机还可以用土风箱代替。由于方法简便，易于推广，只重庆市各单位在一个多月内就利用了四万五千多吨粉矿。
    四川省各钢铁企业利用粉矿以后，由于增添了品位高的“细粮”，使生铁生产持续跃进得到了更充分的保证。小南海铁厂的粉矿经过烧结以后，含铁量提高了5％—10％，使生铁增产20％左右，并节约焦炭10％左右。同时，由于烧结矿碱度高、去硫能力强，还大大提高了生铁质量，使合格率达到90％以上。乐山钢铁厂目前利用的烧结矿，占全厂矿石用量的70％以上。
    根据生产、运输、使用矿石的情况，四川全省每天要剩下上万吨的粉矿，目前全省每天利用的粉矿已达到三千多吨。他们决心进一步大搞粉矿洗、选、烧结，使这些粉矿充分利用起来。
    本报讯　昆明第二钢铁厂大搞粉矿烧结，收到显著效果。粉矿成本比原矿低一半，质量符合高炉冶炼的要求。现在，利用粉矿焙烧的烧结矿已占全厂矿石供应量的35％以上。
    今年以来，昆明第二钢厂高炉利用系数不断提高，矿石需要量大大增加。厂领导研究了这种情况以后，认为除了增产矿石以外，继续大量利用厂内现存粉矿，大搞烧结，是一个很好的办法。起初粉矿烧结的产量比较低，厂领导发动工人群众总结了历次烧结的经验，同时派人到兄弟厂去学习，从炉型、配料、原料处理到烧结操作等方面都作了反复的试验和改进，终于烧结出质量符合高炉要求的烧结矿，促进了高炉产量的提高。
    据新华社南京电　江苏省扬州专区灵岩山钢铁厂职工，充分利用粉矿、焦屑，大搞粉矿烧结，节约铁矿石30％以上，高炉利用系数显著提高，焦比平均下降21％，生铁合格率保持在90％以上，每吨铁成本也降低了五十元左右，出现了优质、高产、低消耗、低成本的全面跃进的新局面。
    从去年6月起，这个厂的工人为利用粉矿、焦屑，降低生铁成本就搞起了一座土砖长窑，烧结粉，矿。接着又对它作了多次改进。今年3月，这个厂的三座高炉同时投入生产，而且高炉经过技术改造以后，胃口越来越大，还得吃精料、细料。针对这种情况，工厂党委发动群众及时处理厂里堆存的粉矿和焦屑，提高粉矿烧结的产量和质量，保证高炉吃饱吃好。全厂职工积极响应党委号召，千方百计围攻粉矿烧结关。党委特地派了党委副书记和副厂长同原料车间工人一起商量，吸取了高炉上多嘴燃烧的经验，创造了“平地多嘴烧结法”，可以同时使十二个烧结窑燃烧，产量猛增，今年下半年烧结矿的入炉量一直保持在50％以上，比去年下半年增长78％。在革新烧结窑的过程中，又创造了螺旋式洗矿机和洗矿池，降低了粉矿的含杂量，使烧结矿的含铁量稳定在50％以上。
