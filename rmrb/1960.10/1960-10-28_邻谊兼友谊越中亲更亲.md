　　On September 15th, Comrade Nguyen Xuan Thuy, member of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Acting President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, hosted a banquet to bid farewell to the delegation of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association. At the banquet, Mr. Yin Jishan, Chairman of the Hanoi City Fatherland Front, impromptu composed a poem as a farewell gift, in which
  the line "Neighborly friendship combined with comradeship, Vietnamese-Chinese kinship even more intimate" truly expresses the close relationship between the people of China and Vietnam.
　　China and Vietnam are fraternal neighbors, like relatives. During the national democratic revolution, the people of both countries sympathized with and supported each other. After liberation, in order to build socialism and communism together, and to oppose the common enemy—American imperialism—the people of both countries further strengthened their unity, supporting and learning from each other. The friendship formed and continuously developed in this process is the most precious and cannot be separated by any force.
　　It was under the shining light of this great friendship that our delegation spent an unforgettable twenty-one days in Vietnam. We were invited by the Vietnam-China Friendship Association to participate in the grand celebration of the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. When we arrived in Hanoi on August 29th, the airport and urban areas were already festooned with festive decorations everywhere. From that day on, we were immersed in the atmosphere of joy with the Vietnamese people. We shouted "Mo Nam" (Vietnamese for "Long Live") with the marching crowds in Ba Dinh Square; we sang and danced with the Vietnamese youth participating in the celebration party in Bach Thao Park.

　　After celebrating Vietnam's National Day, we began our tour. Centered in Hanoi, we visited Haiphong, the Hong Quang Special Zone, Nam Dinh, Phu Tho, Viet Tri, Thai Nguyen, and other places; we visited industrial bases, factories, agricultural cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, schools, museums, and exhibitions; we also toured scenic spots such as Ha Long Bay; and we enjoyed various artistic performances such as Vietnamese opera, ballet, and folk opera. We had extensive contact with Vietnamese workers, farmers, teachers, students, literary and art workers, and state cadres, and we also met revolutionary cadres who had been engaged in underground work for a long time, patriotic fighters who had persisted in fighting against the enemy in the Con Dao prison for fifteen years, commanders and fighters who participated in the famous Dien Bien Phu campaign, soldiers of the Ho Chi Minh Company, and labor models. Everywhere we went, we received warm welcomes and sincere hospitality from the local party and government leaders and the masses. We expressed to them the congratulations of the Chinese people to the Vietnamese people, the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards the Vietnamese people, and the determination of the Chinese people to fully support the Vietnamese people in their struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland and against American imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

　　We are willing to report to the people of our motherland with excitement that the gains of this visit are great. We were particularly impressed by three aspects: Firstly, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, are bravely advancing on the road of socialism; secondly, the Vietnamese people are resolutely fighting against American imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem reactionary clique, and are determined to achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland; thirdly, the Vietnamese people have a very deep friendship with the Chinese people.

　　Bravely Advancing on the Road of Socialism
　　The nationwide celebration of the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by the Vietnamese people is of profound significance. Fifteen years is only a brief moment in human history, but the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, have achieved extremely great achievements and set a brilliant example for the liberation struggle of the people of colonial countries. In the past fifteen years, the heroic Vietnamese people fought valiantly for nine years to win and safeguard national independence and resist imperialist and colonialist aggression and interference, and finally defeated the enemy. After the restoration of peace, the Vietnamese people spent three years healing the wounds of war, restoring the national economy, and continuing to complete the democratic revolution. From 1958, they began the three-year plan for national economic construction, carrying out socialist transformation and socialist construction. This plan will be successfully completed by the end of this year. Compared with six years ago, the total output value of industry and handicrafts this year has increased more than threefold, industry alone has increased nearly sevenfold, and state-owned industry has increased more than sixteenfold. Many products that they could not manufacture in the past can now be manufactured. In agriculture, the total rice output in 1959 increased by more than double the highest level before the war in 1939. Both in terms of output per unit area and per capita, it ranks first in Southeast Asia. In terms of socialist transformation, it will also be basically completed by the end of this year.

　　The Vietnamese people have a strong confidence and high enthusiasm for building socialism. We saw workers, farmers, and cadres working enthusiastically in factories and in the countryside with great drive. Recently, in order to implement the resolutions of the Third National Congress of the Vietnamese Labor Party, a broad production competition movement has been launched in industry and agriculture. The comrade in charge of the Hanoi Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant pointed to a large lathe produced by the plant and told us that when the veteran workers saw that they could manufacture such a lathe and nail on a copper plate with "Made in Vietnam," they touched the copper plate with their hands and couldn't help but shed tears. This fully expresses the excited mood of the Vietnamese worker brothers today. The comrades of the Tran Phu Agricultural Cooperative also made us deeply feel the heroic spirit of the Vietnamese peasant brothers fighting against nature. They spoke in a heroic tone about overcoming natural disasters and said: "Relying on the strength of the cooperative, we must make up for the losses in the early rice crop in the late rice crop."

　　In order to build socialism, the Vietnamese comrades are working very hard in their studies, and they have quickly mastered production technology. The comrade in charge of the Hanoi Progress Printing Factory introduced: "We only have cadres and workers in our factory, no engineers. But the quality of our products has reached the international level." This is no exaggeration, the beautifully printed "Vietnam Pictorial" that we often see in China is produced by this factory.

　　Vietnam's cultural and educational undertakings have developed rapidly, and the purpose of serving socialism, workers, peasants, and soldiers is also very clear. The Hanoi Polytechnic University (a multi-disciplinary industrial university) and the Hanoi Trung Vuong High School that we visited are conscientiously implementing the educational policy of combining education with labor production and combining theory with practice. At the art exhibition, we found that most of the paintings, woodcuts, sculptures, lacquer paintings, etc. are not only skillful in technique and beautiful in shape, but more importantly, they have a strong atmosphere of real life and richly reflect the struggle of the Vietnamese people against imperialism and building socialism; giving people a sense of vitality. The comrade in charge of the exhibition said that this is the result of the Vietnamese art circle's struggle against revisionism. We got the same impression from the artistic performances. The opera "Red Soil Girl," which describes the anti-imperialist struggle, and the ballet "Nghe Tinh Flames," which describes the first establishment of the Soviet regime in Vietnam, were both very successful.

　　The Strong Desire for Peaceful Reunification of the Motherland
　　During our twenty-one days of living in Vietnam, we were almost every day moved by the Vietnamese people's strong desire and firm will to realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland, overthrow the Ngo Dinh Diem reactionary clique, and drive the American imperialists out of South Vietnam. For example, whenever we talked about the Chinese people's full support for the Vietnamese people's struggle for peaceful reunification, the response was always exceptionally enthusiastic applause. Several of the Vietnamese comrades who received us were anti-war cadres who had gathered from the South to the North. They often vividly depicted the charming scenery and people of the South for us with boundless love and longing for their hometowns; they also told us with indignant expressions of hatred about the heinous crimes committed by the American-Ngo clique in the South. I remember once, on the way from Hanoi to Nam Dinh by car, the driver from the South and Comrade Nguyen Thi Luu, who accompanied us, told us in unison: "If you keep driving along this road, you can reach Saigon in one day and one night!"

　　The Vietnamese people not only have a strong desire for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, but also persist in making unremitting efforts to realize this desire through various means. The Vietnamese people, who fought against French imperialism for more than eighty years and then fought against Japanese imperialism for several years during World War II and finally won victory, are experienced in dealing with imperialism and have a clear understanding of imperialism. They never harbor illusions about American imperialism and its lackeys, who are plotting to divide Vietnam for a long time and occupy South Vietnam as an American military base and colony, and are determined to fight against them. As Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said: "There is a saying in Vietnam, 'Fight to the death, the nature does not change.' Imperialism, especially American imperialism, is aggressive and warlike."

　　The Vietnamese people and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have always strictly implemented the Geneva Accords, and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has also repeatedly proposed to the South Vietnamese authorities to hold consultations in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords to discuss the general election and the reunification of the motherland, and to restore normal relations between the North and South regions. However, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities, at the instigation of American imperialism, stubbornly rejected these reasonable proposals. The crimes of American imperialism in trying every possible means to sabotage the Geneva Accords and divide Vietnam have made the Vietnamese people realize more and more deeply that the struggle against American imperialism is a revolutionary struggle, a struggle to maintain and consolidate peace, and to fight for and defend sovereignty, national independence, and territorial integrity. The Vietnamese people have transformed their hatred for American imperialism into the power of action. In Vietnam, we often hear workers, farmers, and cadres explaining their selfless labor by saying: "You must know that this is not only for building socialism in the North, but also for realizing the peaceful reunification of the motherland!" Please see, how well the Vietnamese people have closely combined these two tasks and implemented them in their daily actions. Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said well at the National Day celebration: "The sea may dry up, the stones may crumble, but the will of our entire people to unify the motherland will never waver." Isn't this the common voice of the 29 million Vietnamese people from Mu Nan Quan to Ca Mau Point?

　　Extraordinary Friendship
　　The Vietnamese people have a deep friendship with the Chinese people. They often say that Vietnam and China are not only close neighbors, but also relatives. Just as the Chinese people love the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people love the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. Many Vietnamese cadres seriously study Chairman Mao's works. The Vietnamese people are very concerned about China's socialist construction and cheer for China's brilliant achievements. They are very interested in the experience gained by the Chinese people in revolution and construction, and express their desire to learn from each other and exchange experiences. The director of the Tran Phu Agricultural Cooperative told us that they have absorbed the experience of China's close planting of rice. The Vietnamese people often talk about the assistance given to them by the Chinese people in construction. We told them that China and Vietnam have a relationship of interdependence, sharing weal and woe, and we have always supported and helped each other. Now, Vietnam stands tall on the southern frontier of the socialist camp, defending peace in Southeast Asia and the world. Speaking of support, this is your greatest support to us.

　　The welcome and hospitality we received during our visit were truly warm, attentive, thoughtful, and meticulous; from work to life, from major events to minor details, people felt at all times that countless hearts of friendship were considering us everywhere, and countless hands of friendship were arranging for us. More than 7,000 worker brothers at the Thai Nguyen Iron and Steel Construction Site held a mass meeting especially to welcome the delegation of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association. Looking around the venue, there were countless banners and portraits of the leaders of the two countries. Red flags were waving and songs were rising, which made us feel infinitely excited. In short, our twenty-one days in Vietnam were spent in great joy and in cordial care. This friendship is not an ordinary friendship, it is the love and trust between comrades, it is the warmth and consideration in the revolutionary family, it is the class friendship built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. Premier Zhou Enlai wrote well when he inscribed for the Vietnam-China Friendship Association: "The people of China and Vietnam will be friendly from generation to generation!" Yes, we must be friendly from generation to generation!

### 邻谊兼友谊越中亲更亲

    邻谊兼友谊越中亲更亲
    中越友好协会代表团团长  孙晓村
    9月15日，越南劳动党中央委员、越中友好协会代理会长阮春水同志设宴欢送中越友好协会代表团。在宴会上，河内市祖国战线主席尹继善老先生即席赋诗一首赠别，其中
  “邻谊兼友谊，越中亲更亲”之句，真是道出了中越两国人民之间的亲密关系。
    中越两国是兄弟邻邦，是亲戚。在民族民主革命中，两国人民相互同情，相互支持。解放以后，为了建设社会主义、共产主义的共同事业，为了反对共同敌人——美帝国主义，两国人民进一步加强团结，相互支援，相互学习。在这样过程中形成和不断发展的友谊是最可珍贵的，是任何力量所不能分开的。
    就是在这样伟大的友谊的光辉照耀下，我们代表团在越南度过了难忘的二十一天。我们是应越中友好协会的邀请，去参加越南民主共和国成立十五周年的庆祝盛典的。8月29日，我们到达河内的时候，机场、市区已经到处披上节日的盛装。从这一天开始，我们就和越南人民一同浸沉在欢乐的气氛中。我们在巴亭广场和游行的群众同声高呼“莫南”（越南话，万岁的意思）；在百草公园和参加庆祝晚会的越南青年一起唱歌跳舞。
    欢度越南国庆以后，我们开始参观访问。我们以河内为中心先后访问了海防、鸿广特区、南定、福寿、越池、太原等地；参观了工业基地、工厂、农业合作社、手工艺合作社、学校、博物馆、展览会等；还游览了下龙湾等名胜古迹；欣赏了越南的歌剧、芭蕾舞剧、嘲剧等各种艺术表演。我们同越南的工人、农民、教师、学生、文艺工作者、国家机关干部进行了广泛的接触，并且分别会见了长期从事地下工作的革命干部，在昆仑岛牢狱中坚持同敌人进行十五年斗争的爱国志士，参加过著名的奠边府战役的指挥员、战斗员，胡志明连队的战士，劳动模范等。每到一处，我们都受到当地党、政负责同志和群众的热烈欢迎和殷切款待。我们向他们表达了中国人民对越南人民的祝贺，中国人民对越南人民的深厚友谊，以及中国人民全力支持越南人民争取和平统一祖国、反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团斗争的决心。
    我们愿以兴奋的心情向祖国人民汇报，这次参观访问的收获是很大的。给我们特别深刻的印象有三方面：首先是越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，正在社会主义的大道上奋勇前进；第二是越南人民坚决同美帝国主义和吴庭艳反动集团进行斗争，一定要实现祖国的和平统一；第三是越南人民对中国人民有着非常深厚的友谊。
    在社会主义大道上奋勇前进
    越南人民举国欢腾地庆祝越南民主共和国成立十五周年的节日，是有着深刻的意义的。十五年的时间，在人类历史上只是短暂的瞬间，但越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，却获得了极其巨大的成就，为殖民地国家人民的解放斗争树立了光辉的榜样。在过去的十五年中，英勇的越南人民为争取和维护民族独立，抵抗帝国主义、殖民主义的侵略和干涉，顽强不屈地进行了九年的斗争，终于击败了敌人。和平恢复以后，越南人民用三年的时间来医治战争创伤，恢复国民经济，继续完成民主革命。从1958年起开始国民经济建设的三年计划，进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设。这个计划将在今年年底胜利完成。同六年以前相比，今年工业和手工业的总产值增长了三倍多，单是工业增长了将近七倍，国营工业增长十六倍以上。许多过去自己无法制造的产品现在能够制造了。农业方面，水稻总产量1959年比战前最高的1939年增长一倍以上。不论按单位面积产量或是按人口平均计算，都居东南亚第一位。社会主义改造方面，到今年年底，也将基本上完成。
    越南人民对建设社会主义抱有坚强的信心和高度的热情。我们看到工人、农民、干部在工厂、在农村热情地劳动着，干劲很大。最近，为了实现越南劳动党第三次全国代表大会的决议，工农业方面更展开一个广泛的生产竞赛运动。河内重型机器制造厂的负责同志曾指着本厂生产的一架大型车床告诉我们，当老工人看到自己能制造出这样的车床并且钉上“越南制造”的铜牌时，手摸着铜牌，不由自禁地掉下泪来。这十足表现出越南工人弟兄今天的激动心情。陈富农业合作社的社员同志们，又使我们深深地感到越南农民弟兄同大自然作战的英雄气概。他们以豪迈的口气说到战胜自然灾害，并且说：“依靠合作社的力量，在早造中损失的，我们一定要在晚造中夺回来”。
    为了建设社会主义，越南同志在学习上是很努力的，他们很快地掌握了生产技术。河内进步印刷厂的负责同志介绍说：“我们厂里只有干部、工人，没有工程师。但我们的产品质量已达到国际水平”。这话毫不夸张，我们在国内时常看到的印刷精美的“越南人民画报”，就是这个工厂的出品。
    越南的文化教育事业发展很快，为社会主义、为工农兵服务的目的性也很明确。我们参观过的河内百科大学（一所多科性的工业大学）和河内征王中学，都在认真地贯彻教育与劳动生产相结合、理论与实践相结合的教育方针。我们在美术展览会上，发现绝大部分的图画、木刻、塑像、磨漆画等不但技巧娴熟，造型优美，更重要的是，具有浓厚的现实生活的气息，丰富多采地反映出越南人民反对帝国主义、建设社会主义的斗争；给人一种生气蓬勃之感。展览会的负责同志说，这是越南美术界进行反对修正主义斗争的结果。我们从艺术表演中也获得了同样的印象。描写反帝斗争的歌剧“红土姑娘”，和描写越南第一次成立苏维埃政权的芭蕾舞剧“宜静火焰”，都很成功。
    和平统一祖国的强烈愿望
    我们在越南生活的二十一天当中，几乎没有一天不被越南人民要求实现祖国的和平统一、打倒吴庭艳反动集团、把美帝国主义者从越南南方赶出去的这种强烈的愿望和坚强的意志所感动。例如，当我们讲话时，只要讲到中国人民全力支持越南人民争取和平统一的斗争，答复我们的总是异常热烈的掌声。接待我们的越南同志，有好几位是从南方北上集结的抗战干部。他们常常怀着对家乡的无限热爱和思念，生动地为我们描绘南方迷人的风光、人物；他们也以不胜仇恨激昂的神情向我们诉说美吴集团在南方所干下的令人发指的罪恶勾当。记得一次由河内乘车去南定的路上，来自南方的司机和陪伴我们的阮氏榴同志不约而同地告诉我们：“沿着这条道路一直开下去、开下去，一天一夜就可以到达西贡！”
    越南人民不仅具有和平统一祖国的强烈愿望，而且通过各种各样的方式坚持为实现这一愿望不懈地进行斗争。曾经同法帝国主义斗争了八十多年、第二次世界大战时期又同日本帝国主义斗争了好几个年头而终于赢得胜利的越南人民，在同帝国主义交手方面是有经验的，对帝国主义是有认识的。对于阴谋长期分裂越南、霸占越南南方为美国军事基地和殖民地的美帝国主义及其走狗，越南人民从来不存幻想，而坚决与之进行斗争。正如范文同总理讲过的：“越南有句俗话说，‘打到死，性不变’。帝国主义，尤其是美帝国主义是侵略和好战的。”
    越南人民和越南民主共和国一贯严正履行日内瓦协议，越南民主共和国政府还曾不止一次地建议根据日内瓦协议的规定，同越南南方当局进行协商，讨论普选和统一祖国问题，建议北南两个地区恢复正常关系等等。但是，吴庭艳当局在美帝国主义的唆使下，一味拒绝这些合情合理的建议。美帝国主义千方百计地破坏日内瓦协议、分割越南的罪行，使越南人民越来越深刻地认识到，反对美帝国主义的斗争是一场革命斗争，是为维护和巩固和平、为争取和保卫主权、民族独立和领土完整的斗争。越南人民把他们对美帝国主义的仇恨化成为行动的力量。我们在越南，常听得工人、农民和干部同志解释他们忘我的劳动时说：要知道，这不仅是为了在北方建设社会主义，也为的是实现祖国的和平统一呵！请看，越南人民已经多么好地把这两项任务紧密地结合在一起，而且贯彻到日常行动中去了。范文同总理在国庆庆祝大会上说得好：“海可枯，石可烂，但是我们全国人民统一祖国的意志是决不动摇的。”这难道不是从睦南关到金瓯角的二千九百万越南人民的共同的声音吗？
    不寻常的友谊
    越南人民对中国人民有着深厚的友谊。他们常说，越南同中国不但是近邻，而且是亲戚。同中国人民热爱越南劳动党和胡志明主席一样，越南人民热爱中国共产党和毛泽东主席。很多越南干部同志认真地研究毛主席的著作。越南人民非常关心中国的社会主义建设，为中国的辉煌成就而欢呼。他们对中国人民在革命和建设中所取得的经验，非常感兴趣，表示要相互学习、相互交流经验。陈富农业合作社的主任告诉我们，他们种稻子已经吸收中国密植的经验。越南人民常常谈到中国人民在建设方面给予他们的援助。我们告诉他们，中越两国有着唇齿相依、休戚与共的关系，我们一直是相互支援，相互帮助的。现在，越南屹立在社会主义阵营的南方前哨，保卫着东南亚和世界的和平。说到支援，这是你们对我们的最大支援。
    我们代表团在参观访问过程中所受到的欢迎与款待，真是热烈、殷勤、周到、细致；从工作到生活，从大事到小节，使人无时不感到处处有无数颗友谊的心在为我们考虑，有无数双友谊的手在为我们安排。太原钢铁工地的七千多名工人弟兄专为欢迎中越友好协会代表团举行了群众大会。在会场上一眼望去，数不清的标语牌和两国的领袖像。红旗招展，歌声四起，使我们感到无限激动。总之，我们在越南逗留的二十一天，是在巨大的欢乐中度过的，是在亲切的关怀中度过的。这种友谊不是寻常的友谊，这是同志之间的爱护与信任，这是革命大家庭中的温暖与体贴，这是建筑在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的阶级友谊。周恩来总理为越中友好协会题词时写得好：“中越两国人民世世代代友好下去！”是的，我们一定要世世代代友好下去！
