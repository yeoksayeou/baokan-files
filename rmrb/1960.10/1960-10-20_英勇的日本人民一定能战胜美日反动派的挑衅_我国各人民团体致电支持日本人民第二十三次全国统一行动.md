    China Peace Committee's cable
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, today sent a cable to the Japan Peace Committee and forwarded it to the National Council to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty, firmly supporting the Japanese people's 23rd national unified action to protest against the US-Japanese reactionaries' condoning of fascist thugs' assassination of Inejiro Asanuma and oppose the US-Japan military alliance treaty.
    The cable said, on the occasion of the Japanese people's 23rd national unified action against the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and Mr. Inejiro Asanuma's funeral, we extend our highest respect to the Japanese people who are resolutely struggling against US imperialism and its agents, and once again express our deep condolences to the outstanding warrior, Mr. Asanuma.
    The cable said that the indomitable spirit and brilliant victories achieved by the Japanese people in their great patriotic and just struggle have severely hit the war plots and aggression plans of the US-Japanese reactionaries, greatly encouraged and strengthened the confidence and courage of the people of all countries to oppose the common enemy, US imperialism, and made great contributions to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.
    The cable said that the US-Japanese reactionaries' instigation of fascist thugs to kill Mr. Asanuma by despicable means further exposed their hideous faces and their weak nature. They are panicking in the face of the growing progressive and democratic forces in Japan and other countries, and are unscrupulously digging their own graves. No matter what means the US-Japanese reactionaries take, we believe that they will never frighten the heroic Japanese people. The perverse acts of the US-Japanese reactionaries will only educate the Japanese people more profoundly from the negative side, prompting them to become more aware, more united, and more tenacious in persisting in the struggle.
    The cable said that Mr. Asanuma contributed his life and blood in the struggle against the common enemy, US imperialism, and in defending peace in Asia and the world, and he will always live in our hearts. When one person falls, millions of people will stand up. We believe that Mr. Asanuma is still alive. He is standing even more powerfully at the forefront of the 23rd unified action, at the forefront of the struggle for peace.
    The cable said, we reiterate that the Chinese people resolutely support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against US imperialist aggression, against the US-Japan military alliance treaty, against the revival of Japanese militarism, and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. The Chinese people firmly support the Japanese people's efforts to promote friendship between the people of China and Japan and the normalization of relations between the two countries. The Chinese people will always stand with the Japanese people to fight to the end against the common enemy, US imperialism, and to defend peace in Asia and the world. We firmly believe that with the broad support of peace-loving people in all countries of the world, the Japanese people's just struggle and our common cause will surely achieve greater and greater victories.
    China Asian-African Solidarity Committee's cable
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the China Asian-African Solidarity Committee, today sent a cable to the Japan Asian-African Solidarity Committee and forwarded it to the National Council to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty, firmly supporting the Japanese people's 23rd national unified action to protest against the US-Japanese reactionaries' condoning of fascist thugs' assassination of Inejiro Asanuma and oppose the US-Japan military alliance treaty.
    The cable said, today is the day when the Japanese people are issuing a new battle call to the US-Japanese reactionaries, holding the 23rd national unified action against the US-Japan "Security Treaty," and also the day of the funeral of Mr. Asanuma, an active fighter in the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle. The China Asian-African Solidarity Committee reiterates its firm support for the Japanese people's indomitable and heroic struggle, and expresses its deep condolences to Mr. Asanuma, a friend respected by the Chinese people.
    The cable said that for more than a year, the Japanese people have achieved brilliant victories and rich experience in the struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs, and have severely hit the US imperialist aggression and war plans.
    The cable said that just as the Japanese people are continuing to struggle for greater victories, the US-Japanese reactionaries have assassinated Mr. Asanuma in an attempt to intimidate the Japanese progressive and democratic forces and suppress the Japanese people's struggle by despicable and terrorist means. This is not only a provocation to the Japanese people, but also a provocation to the people of Asia, Africa and the world. However, we believe that any terrorist means of the US-Japanese reactionaries will never frighten the heroic Japanese people, but will only prompt the Japanese people to further recognize the essence of the US-Japanese reactionaries and unite more closely to carry out the struggle.
    The cable said that the criminal acts committed by US imperialism everywhere are increasingly arousing public indignation among the people of all countries. Mr. Asanuma once emphasized before his death that US imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan, and US imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Asia. Now, US imperialism is becoming more and more isolated, while the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle is receiving more and more widespread support from the people of all countries. We firmly believe that the ranks of the Japanese people's struggle will surely grow stronger day by day, and will surely achieve more and greater victories on the basis of the great victories and rich experience already achieved. Any conspiracy of the US-Japanese reactionaries is destined to fail in the end.
    All-China Federation of Trade Unions' cable
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent a cable to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and forwarded it to the National Council to Prevent the Revision of the "Security Treaty," firmly supporting the Japanese people's 23rd national unified action against the US-Japan military alliance treaty.
    The cable said: "The Japanese workers and people, in order to resolutely fight back against the fascist atrocities of killing Mr. Inejiro Asanuma, an outstanding patriotic politician in Japan, have launched the 23rd unified action against the US-Japan 'Security' Treaty throughout the country ahead of schedule. The Chinese workers and the people of the whole country stand firmly with the Japanese workers and people who oppose US imperialist aggression, strive for national independence, and safeguard world peace, and support the anti-US patriotic and just struggle launched by the Japanese workers and people.
    "Mr. Inejiro Asanuma is a friend respected by the Chinese people. He has made great contributions to opposing our common enemy, US imperialism, to defending world peace, and to promoting friendship between the people of China and Japan.
    "Just as the anti-US patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese workers and people has achieved great victories and the Japanese general election is approaching, the US-Japanese reactionaries have condoned fascist thugs to kill Mr. Inejiro Asanuma, which is by no means accidental. This is a new offensive launched by the US-Japanese reactionaries against the Japanese workers and people. This fascist atrocity of the US-Japanese reactionaries can only promote the Japanese workers and people to unite more widely and more resolutely to launch a struggle for national independence and to safeguard democratic rights. The 23rd national unified action launched by the Japanese workers and people powerfully demonstrates their strong will to struggle. We firmly believe that the struggle of the Japanese workers and people for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will surely achieve final victory."
    Seven industrial unions' cables
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. China's seven industrial unions today separately sent cables to various Japanese industrial unions, firmly supporting the Japanese people's 23rd national unified action against the US-Japan "Security Treaty." The National Committee of the China Heavy Industry Trade Union, the National Committee of the China Machinery Trade Union, the National Committee of the China Railway Trade Union, the National Committee of the China Coal Mine Trade Union, the National Committee of the China Postal and Telecommunications Trade Union, the National Committee of the China Seamen's Trade Union, and the National Committee of the China Education Trade Union, in their respective cables to the Japan Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union Federation, the All-Japan Metal Mine Workers' Union Federation, the Japan Central Metal Joint Struggle Conference, the Japan National Railway Workers' Union, the Japan Private Railway Trade Unions Confederation, the Japan Coal Mine Workers' Union, the Japan All-Communications Workers' Union, the Japan National Electrical Communications Workers' Union, the Japan Port Labor Association, and the Japan Teachers' Union, all expressed indignation at the despicable act of the US-Japanese reactionaries condoning fascist thugs to assassinate Inejiro Asanuma, expressed firm support for the 23rd national unified action launched by Japanese workers and people against the US-Japan military alliance treaty, and expressed their belief that final victory will surely belong to the Japanese workers and people who adhere to the just struggle.
    China Council for the Promotion of International Trade's cable
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, today sent a cable to the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association and forwarded it to the Japanese National Council to Prevent the Revision of the "Security Treaty," firmly supporting the Japanese people's 23rd national unified action against the US-Japan "Security Treaty."
    The cable said: "The Japanese people's anti-US patriotic and just struggle is advancing victoriously, which no reactionary force can stop. The US-Japanese reactionaries condoned fascist thugs to kill Mr. Asanuma and launched a new offensive against the Japanese people, which once again proves that US imperialism and its running dogs are the mortal enemies of the Japanese people."
    The cable said, "We firmly believe that the broad masses of Japanese people who are increasingly united and awakened will, through unyielding struggle, surely drive away US imperialism and realize an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan. While mourning Mr. Asanuma, we are more and more convinced that your struggle will surely achieve final victory."
    China Red Cross Society's cable
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Li Dequan, President of the China Red Cross Society, today sent a cable to the Japan-China Friendship Association and forwarded it to the National Council to Prevent the Revision of the "Security Treaty," firmly supporting the Japanese people's 23rd national unified action to abolish the US-Japan military alliance treaty.
    The cable said that the Japanese people's anti-US patriotic and just struggle has achieved great victories. In the face of the great unity of the Japanese people, the US-Japanese reactionaries have become very frightened, and they are trying to suppress the people's fighting spirit with terrorist means. The assassination of Mr. Asanuma this time happened under this background. It is by no means an accidental event. It is part of the overall conspiracy of the US-Japanese reactionary forces to launch an offensive against the Japanese patriotic and democratic forces.
    The cable said that Mr. Asanuma is an outstanding Japanese patriotic warrior and a friend respected by the Chinese people. Although Mr. Asanuma was unfortunately killed, we believe that the awakened Japanese people will unite more closely, and the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and the promotion of normalization of relations between China and Japan will surely achieve final victory.
    Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs' cable
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, today sent a cable to the Japan National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations and forwarded it to the National Council to Prevent the Revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," firmly supporting the Japanese people's 23rd national unified action against the US-Japan "Security Treaty."
    The cable said: "In the past two years, the Japanese people have held twenty-two large-scale national unified actions with an indomitable spirit to oppose the US-Japan 'Security Treaty,' severely hitting the conspiracy of the US-Japanese reactionaries to plan a new war of aggression."
    The cable said, "Mr. Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, together with the Japanese people, has carried out an indomitable struggle against the common enemy of the people of China and Japan, US imperialism, and the revival of Japanese militarism. At the same time, Mr. Asanuma has made valuable contributions to enhancing the friendly relations between the people of China and Japan and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. On the eve of the Japanese general election, the US-Japanese reactionaries condoned fascist thugs to assassinate Mr. Asanuma, which is by no means an isolated and accidental event. It is a serious signal that the US-Japanese reactionaries are launching a new offensive against the Japanese people. The US-Japanese reactionaries attempted to suppress the Japanese people's struggle by assassinating Mr. Asanuma, but this despicable means not only cannot intimidate the Japanese people, but on the contrary, can only make the Japanese people further recognize the hideous faces of the US-Japanese reactionaries and arouse greater anger and resistance from the Japanese people against the US-Japanese reactionaries."
    The cable concluded: "We Chinese people will always stand on the side of the Japanese people. We firmly believe that the Japanese people who have awakened will further strengthen unity in the future and wage a more resolute struggle to completely defeat US imperialism and its running dogs."
    All-China Youth Federation and All-China Students' Federation's cable
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today sent a cable to the Japan National Council to Prevent the Revision of the "Security Treaty" and the Japan Democratic Youth League, the Japan General Council of Trade Unions Youth Department, the All-Japan Farmers' Association Youth Department, the Japan Socialist Youth League, and the Japan National Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, supporting the 23rd national unified action of the Japanese people and youth students.
    The cable said: "The Japanese Ikeda government, following the Kishi Nobusuke government, stubbornly implements the reactionary policy of following the United States, hostile to China, strengthening the US-Japan military alliance treaty, and reviving Japanese militarism. In the face of the increasingly united and powerful patriotic and democratic forces of the Japanese people, the US-Japanese reactionaries do not hesitate to adopt despicable fascist means and barbaric suppression to deal with the peace-loving and democratic Japanese people and youth students. The recent assassination of Japanese patriotic politician Mr. Inejiro Asanuma by fascist thugs has once again exposed the ferocious and brutal faces of the US-Japanese reactionaries. The reactionary policies and fascist atrocities of the US-Japanese reactionaries can only arouse increasingly strong resistance from the Japanese people and youth students, thereby promoting the Japanese patriotic and democratic forces to further strengthen unity and launch a more resolute struggle to defeat US imperialism and its agents and oppose fascist forces.
    The cable expressed its firm belief that the Japanese people's struggle against US imperialist aggression, against the revival of Japanese militarism, and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will surely achieve final victory.

    英勇的日本人民一定能战胜美日反动派的挑衅
    我国各人民团体致电支持日本人民第二十三次全国统一行动
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的电报
    新华社19日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若今天致电日本和平委员会并转阻止修改安全条约国民会议，坚决支持日本人民为抗议美日反动派纵容法西斯暴徒暗杀浅沼稻次郎，反对日美军事同盟条约而举行的第二十三次全国统一行动。
    电报说，值此日本人民举行第二十三次反对日美“安全条约”全国统一行动和浅沼稻次郎先生葬仪之日，谨向再接再厉地为反对美帝国主义及其代理人进行坚决斗争的日本人民，致以崇高的敬意，并且再一次向卓越的战士浅沼先生，表示沉痛的悼念。
    电报说，日本人民在伟大的爱国正义斗争中所表现的不屈不挠的精神和所取得的辉煌胜利，沉重地打击了美日反动派的战争阴谋和侵略计划，大大地鼓舞和增强了各国人民反对共同的敌人美帝国主义的信心和勇气，对保卫亚洲和世界的和平作出了巨大的贡献。
    电报说，美日反动派指使法西斯暴徒用卑鄙手段杀害浅沼先生，进一步暴露了它们的狰狞面目，也进一步暴露了它们的虚弱本质。它们在不断壮大着的日本和各国进步民主力量面前，感到恐慌，不择手段地在为自己挖掘坟墓。美日反动派尽管采取什么手段，我们相信，都绝对吓不倒英勇的日本人民。美日反动派的倒行逆施，只会从反面更深刻地教育日本人民，促使他们更加觉悟、更加团结、更加顽强地坚持斗争。
    电报说，浅沼先生，在反对共同的敌人美帝国主义和保卫亚洲与世界和平的斗争中，贡献了他的生命和鲜血，他将永远活在我们的心里。一个人倒下去，千百万个人会站起来。我们相信，浅沼先生是还活着的。他更加强有力地站在第二十三次的统一行动的最前列，站在争取和平战线的最前列。
    电报说，我们重申：中国人民坚决支持日本人民反对美帝国主义侵略，反对日美军事同盟条约，反对复活日本军国主义，争取独立、民主、和平、中立的爱国正义斗争。中国人民坚决支持日本人民为促进中日两国人民友好和两国关系正常化而进行的努力。中国人民将永远同日本人民一起，为反对共同的敌人美帝国主义、保卫亚洲和世界的和平而斗争到底。我们深信，在爱好和平的世界各国人民的广泛支持下，日本人民的正义斗争和我们的共同事业一定会取得越来越大的胜利。
    中国亚非团结委员会的电报
    据新华社19日讯　中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志今天致电日本亚非团结委员会并转阻止修改安全条约国民会议，坚决支持日本人民为抗议美日反动派纵容法西斯暴徒杀害浅沼稻次郎、反对日美军事同盟条约而举行的第二十三次全国统一行动。
    电报说，今天是日本人民向美日反动派发出新的战斗号角，举行第二十三次反对日美“安全条约”全国统一行动的日子，也是日本人民爱国正义斗争中的积极战士浅沼先生葬仪的日子。中国亚非团结委员会重申对日本人民不屈不挠的英勇斗争表示坚决的支持，并向中国人民尊敬的朋友浅沼先生表示沉痛的哀悼。
    电报说，一年多来，日本人民在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中，获得了辉煌的胜利和丰富的经验，并且严重地打击了美帝国主义的侵略和战争计划。
    电报说，正当日本人民为争取更大的胜利而继续斗争的时候，美日反动派竟然暗杀了浅沼先生，企图以卑劣和恐怖手段恫吓日本进步民主力量，压制日本人民的斗争。这不仅是对日本人民的挑衅，也是对亚洲、非洲及世界各国人民的挑衅。但是，我们相信，美日反动派的任何恐怖手段都绝对吓不倒英勇的日本人民，而只能促使日本人民进一步认清美日反动派的本质，更加团结起来进行斗争。
    电报说，美帝国主义到处所犯下的罪恶行为，日益激起各国人民的公愤。浅沼先生在生前就曾经着重指出：美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人，美帝国主义是亚洲人民的共同敌人。现在，美帝国主义正越来越陷于孤立，而日本人民的爱国正义斗争则越来越得到各国人民广泛的支持。我们深信，日本人民的斗争的队伍一定会一天比一天壮大，一定能够在已经取得的巨大胜利和丰富经验的基础上，取得更多更大的胜利。美日反动派的任何阴谋，最后都注定要失败。
    中华全国总工会的电报
    新华社19日讯　中华全国总工会今天致电日本工会总评议会转阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议，坚决支持日本人民为反对美日军事同盟条约而举行的第二十三次全国统一行动。
    电报说：“日本工人和人民，为坚决反击杀害日本卓越的爱国政治家浅沼稻次郎先生的法西斯暴行，提前在全国范围内展开第二十三次反对日美‘安全’条约的统一行动。中国工人和全国人民一道，坚决同反对美帝国主义侵略、争取民族独立、维护世界和平的日本工人和人民站在一起，支持日本工人和人民所展开的反美爱国正义斗争。
    “浅沼稻次郎先生是中国人民尊敬的朋友，他为反对我们的共同敌人美帝国主义，为保卫世界和平，为促进中日两国人民友好，作出了很大的贡献。
    “正当日本工人和日本人民反美爱国正义斗争取得了巨大胜利和日本大选即将来临之际，美日反动派纵容法西斯暴徒杀害了浅沼稻次郎先生，这决非是偶然的。这是美日反动派向日本工人和人民发动的新的进攻。美日反动派这种法西斯暴行，只能促使日本工人和人民更加广泛地团结起来，将更加坚决地为争取民族独立和维护民主权利展开斗争。日本工人和人民所展开的第二十三次全国统一行动有力地表明了他们斗争的坚强意志。我们坚信，日本工人和人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争一定能够取得最后胜利。”
    七个产业工会的电报
    新华社19日讯　中国七个产业工会今天分别致电日本各产业工会，坚决支持日本人民为反对美日“安全条约”而举行的第二十三次全国统一行动。中国重工业工会全国委员会、中国机械工会全国委员会、中国铁路工会全国委员会、中国煤矿工会全国委员会、中国邮电工会全国委员会、中国海员工会全国委员会和中国教育工会全国委员会，在分别打给日本合成化学产业工会联合会、全日本金属矿山工会联合会、日本中央金属共斗会议、日本国营铁路工会、日本私营铁路工会总联合会、日本煤矿工会、日本全递信工会、日本全国电气通信工会、日本港湾劳协、日本教职员工会的电报中，都对美日反动派纵容法西斯暴徒刺杀浅沼稻次郎的卑鄙行为表示愤慨，表示坚决支持日本工人和人民为反对美日军事同盟条约而举行的第二十三次全国统一行动，并表示相信最后的胜利一定属于坚持正义斗争的日本工人和人民。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会的电报
    据新华社19日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸今天致电日中贸易促进会转日本阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议，坚决支持日本人民为反对日美“安全条约”而举行的第二十三次全国统一行动。
    电报说：“日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争正在乘胜前进，这是任何反动势力所不能阻挡的。美日反动派纵容法西斯暴徒杀害浅沼先生，向日本人民发动新的进攻，这再一次证明了美帝国主义及其走狗是日本人民的死敌。”
    电报说，“我们深信：日益团结和觉醒起来的广大日本人民，经过不屈不挠的斗争，一定会赶走美帝国主义，实现独立、民主、和平、中立的日本。我们在悼念浅沼先生的同时，愈益坚信你们的斗争一定能够取得最后的胜利。”
    中国红十字会的电报
    新华社19日讯　中国红十字会会长李德全今天致电日本中国友好协会转阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议，坚决支持日本人民为废除日美军事同盟条约而举行的第二十三次全国统一行动。
    电报说，日本人民反美爱国的正义斗争，已经取得了巨大的胜利。在日本人民伟大的团结力量面前，美日反动派已经显得十分恐惧，他们妄图用恐怖手段镇压人民的斗志。这次浅沼先生的被刺正是在这种背景下发生的，它绝不是一个偶然的事件，它是美日反动势力对日本爱国民主力量发动进攻的总阴谋的一部分。
    电报说，浅沼先生是日本卓越的爱国主义战士，也是中国人民尊敬的朋友。浅沼先生虽然不幸被害，但是我们相信觉悟了的日本人民将会团结得更紧，日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立和促进中日两国关系正常化的斗争一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    中国人民外交学会的电报
    据新华社19日讯　中国人民外交学会会长张奚若今天致电日本恢复日中邦交国民会议转阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，坚决支持日本人民为反对日美“安全条约”而举行的第二十三次全国统一行动。
    电报说：“两年来，日本人民以不屈不挠的精神为反对日美‘安全条约’举行了二十二次规模巨大的全国统一行动，严重地打击了美日反动派策划新的侵略战争的阴谋。”
    电报说，“日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎先生和日本人民在一起，为反对中日两国人民的共同敌人美帝国主义和日本军国主义的复活进行了不屈不挠的斗争，同时，浅沼先生为增进中日两国人民的友好关系和保卫亚洲和世界和平作出了可贵的贡献。在日本大选前夕，美日反动派纵容法西斯暴徒刺杀浅沼先生绝不是孤立的偶然事件，它是美日反动派向日本人民发动新的进攻的严重讯号。美日反动派企图以刺杀浅沼先生的手段来镇压日本人民的斗争，但是这种卑鄙的手段不仅恫吓不了日本人民，相反地只能使日本人民进一步认清美日反动派的狰狞面目，激起日本人民对美日反动派更大的愤怒和反抗。”
    电报最后说：“我们中国人民将永远站在日本人民一边。我们坚信，已经觉醒了的日本人民今后将会进一步加强团结，为彻底击败美帝国主义及其走狗而更坚决地进行斗争。”
    全国青联和学联的电报
    据新华社19日讯　中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会今天致电日本阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议并日本民主青年同盟、日本总评青年部、全日本农民协会青年部、日本社会主义青年同盟、日本全国学生自治会联络会议，支持日本人民和青年学生的二十三次全国统一行动。
    电报说：“日本池田政府继岸信介政府之后顽固地执行追随美国、敌视中国，加强日美军事同盟条约、复活日本军国主义的反动政策。在日本人民日益团结和强大的爱国民主力量面前，美日反动派竟不惜采用卑鄙的法西斯手段和野蛮镇压的办法来对付爱好和平和民主的日本人民和青年学生。最近日本爱国政治家浅沼稻次郎先生被法西斯暴徒杀害的事件，就再一次暴露了美日反动派的凶恶残暴面目。美日反动派的反动政策和法西斯暴行，只能激起日本人民和青年学生越来越强烈的反抗，从而促使日本爱国民主力量更进一步加强团结，为击败美帝国主义及其代理人为反对法西斯势力而展开更加坚决的斗争。
    电报表示，坚信日本人民反对美帝国主义侵略、反对日本军国主义复活和争取独立、民主、和平和中立的斗争，一定能够取得最后胜利。
