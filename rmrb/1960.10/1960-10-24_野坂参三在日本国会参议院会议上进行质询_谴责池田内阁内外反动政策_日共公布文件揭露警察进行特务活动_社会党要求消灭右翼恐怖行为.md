Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: Japanese Communist Party Chairman and Diet member Nozaka Sanzō interrogated the Ikeda government's reactionary policies at a plenary session of the Japanese House of Councillors held on the 23rd.

Nozaka condemned the Ikeda Cabinet for not only delaying the dissolution of the Diet, but also forcibly implementing the new "Security Treaty," unreasonably punishing patriotic workers who participated in the struggle against the "Security Treaty," and openly clamoring to "strengthen public order" to intensify the suppression of the people. Nozaka pointed out that the central point of contention in the next Japanese general election is the "Security Treaty" issue. Nozaka condemned the Ikeda Cabinet for deliberately evading this issue and instead resorting to deception and relying on money and violence to win votes.

Referring to the assassination of Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma, Nozaka pointed out that this was a political conspiracy aimed at removing obstacles to the implementation of the "Security Treaty" system and preventing the advancement of democratic forces.

Nozaka pointed out that the reason why extreme right-wing elements are so rampant is that the Ikeda Cabinet is implementing the "Security Treaty" system, strengthening suppression, and advocating nationalism.

Nozaka exposed the ugly relationship between extreme right-wing elements and the Liberal Democratic Party, Japanese monopoly capital, and American imperialism, as well as the South Korean and Chiang Kai-shek cliques, and demanded that the Ikeda government investigate their relationship. Nozaka also firmly demanded the dismissal of all security officials related to the Asanuma assassination, the immediate dissolution of extreme right-wing fascist groups, and the Ikeda Cabinet's resignation en masse to take responsibility for the Asanuma assassination.

Nozaka also revealed that the essence of the Ikeda Cabinet's so-called "new policy" is to use the new "Security Treaty" as leverage to strengthen militarization and imperialization in all aspects of politics, military affairs, economy, and ideology.

Nozaka stated that the Japanese Communist Party will stand at the forefront of the people and fight against the Ikeda Cabinet's reactionary "new policy."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: The Japanese Communist Party today made public relevant materials it obtained from the Shimane Prefecture Police Headquarters, exposing the Japanese reactionary government's police for trampling on the constitution and engaging in anti-people activities.

Yoshio Shiga held a press conference on behalf of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party on this issue. He stated that the Japanese Communist Party will submit these materials to the Diet to thoroughly investigate the government's responsibility.

These materials include orders and notifications from the Police Agency to the Shimane Prefecture Police Headquarters, as well as meeting records, activity records, and documents related to financial matters. Yoshio Shiga pointed out that these documents clearly explain why the police inflict brutal suppression on workers and students, but are "unable to take action" against the extreme right-wing thugs who murdered Asanuma.

Shiga revealed that the documents prove that the police authorities' personnel and financial resources are mostly used to suppress democratic groups and conduct espionage activities against them, and they often use methods that trample on human rights, such as installing wiretaps and bribing mail carriers for reconnaissance. The police authorities also instructed that this kind of thing should not be leaked to the outside world. Shiga said that these documents also clearly prove that the Japanese police have close financial ties with American intelligence agencies and extreme right-wing elements. In order to prevent the leakage of these ugly things, the police authorities also ordered lower-level police agencies to prepare two sets of books.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: At a meeting on the 22nd, the Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party decided to submit a resolution to the Diet to eliminate right-wing terrorism. This proposal requires the government to investigate the actual situation and behind-the-scenes relationships of right-wing terrorist activities, and to cut off the supply of funds to right-wing terrorist groups in order to completely eliminate the breeding ground for terrorist activities.

At this meeting, the Socialist Party also decided to submit a bill requesting the rapid and fundamental revision of the "Political Funds Control Law" and the "Public Office Election Law" in order to eliminate the situation in which monopoly capital manipulates elections.

    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本共产党主席、国会议员野坂参三在23日举行的日本国会参议院全体会议上进行质询，严厉谴责池田政府的反动政策。
    野坂谴责，池田内阁不仅拖延解散国会，而且强行实施新“安全条约”，并无理处罚了参加反对“安全条约”斗争的爱国工人，还公开扬言要“加强治安”以加紧镇压人民。野坂指出，下届日本大选的中心争论点是“安全条约”问题。野坂谴责池田内阁故意回避这个问题，而在玩弄欺骗手段和依靠金钱和暴力骗取选票。
    野坂提到社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎被杀害的事件时指出，这是政治性阴谋，它的目的在于铲除实施“安全条约”体系的障碍和阻止民主力量前进。
    野坂指出，极右分子所以如此猖獗，其原因在于池田内阁实行
  “安全条约”体系和加强镇压以及鼓吹国家主义。
    野坂揭露极右分子同自由民主党、日本垄断资本和美帝国主义以及南朝鲜、蒋介石集团的丑恶关系，并且要求池田政府查明它们的关系。野坂还坚决要求罢免与浅沼被害事件有关的全体治安负责人，立即解散极右翼法西斯团体，池田内阁就浅沼被杀害事件引咎总辞职。
    野坂还揭露，池田内阁的所谓“新政策”实质是以新“安全条约”为杠杆要在政治、军事、经济和思想等各方面加强军国主义化和帝国主义化。
    野坂表示，日共将站在人民的前列，针对池田内阁反动的“新政策”进行斗争。
    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本共产党今天将它所取得的日本岛根县警察总署的有关资料加以公开，揭露日本反动政府的警察蹂躏宪法进行反人民的活动。
    志贺义雄代表日共中央就这一问题举行记者招待会。他表示，日共将向国会提出这些资料，彻底追究政府的责任。
    这些资料包括警察厅对岛根县警察总署的命令、通知，以及会议纪录、活动纪录和有关财政情况等文件。志贺义雄指出，这些文件清楚地说明，警察为什么对工人和学生施加凶暴镇压，而对杀害浅沼的极右翼暴徒却“无法下手”的原因。
    志贺揭露说，文件证明了警察当局的人员和财源多用于镇压民主团体和对它们进行间谍活动，并且经常使用安置窃听机、收买邮件投递人进行侦探等蹂躏人权的手段。警察当局还指令不要把这种事情向外泄漏。志贺说，这些文件还清楚地证明日本警察在财政上和美国情报机关与极右翼分子有着密切关系。警察当局为了防止这种丑恶事情的泄漏，还命令下级警察机关编制两本账本。
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本社会党中央执行委员会在22日的会议上决定向国会提出消灭右翼恐怖行为的决议案。这项提案要求政府调查右翼恐怖行为的实际情况和幕后关系，并且断绝向右翼恐怖团体供给经费，以便彻底扫除恐怖行为的温床。
    在这次会议上社会党还决定提出议案要求迅速根本修改“限制政治经费法”和“公职选举法”，以消除垄断资本操纵选举的情况。
