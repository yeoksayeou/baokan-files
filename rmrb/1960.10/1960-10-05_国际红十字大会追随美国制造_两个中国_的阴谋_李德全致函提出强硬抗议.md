Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The President of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Li Dequan, recently wrote to Mr. François-Poncet, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the International Red Cross, lodging a strong protest regarding the recently published report of the 19th International Red Cross Conference serving the US plot to create "Two Chinas." The full text of the letter of protest is as follows:

Mr. François-Poncet, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the International Red Cross:

I am entrusted by the Government of the People's Republic of China and represent the Chinese Red Cross to lodge a serious protest against the report of the 19th International Red Cross Conference for concealing the US plot to create "Two Chinas" and distorting and slandering the just struggle of the Chinese delegation, and declare that this report is completely unacceptable.

The US government's heinous act of openly creating a "Two Chinas" plot at the 19th International Red Cross Conference has seriously damaged international Red Cross activities. Now, the relevant responsible parties of the conference have neither learned from the lessons of the 19th International Red Cross Conference, nor have they accepted the solemn demands repeatedly put forward by the delegation of the People's Republic of China after the conference to correctly handle the report of the 19th International Red Cross Conference in order to eliminate the adverse effects caused by the United States. On the one hand, the report of the 19th International Red Cross Conference arbitrarily deleted and cut Ambassador Pan Zili, head of the delegation of the People's Republic of China’s speech, obliterating the condemnation of the US plot by the People's Republic of China; on the other hand, it published the full text of the US government representative’s fallacies attacking the People's Republic of China, and published the shameful so-called "Resolution 36" which the United States forced the conference to pass, which undermines the International Red Cross Charter and creates a "Two Chinas" plot. This report even juxtaposes the list of members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique illegally brought into the venue by the US representative with the list of representatives of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese Red Cross firmly opposes the actions of the relevant responsible parties of the conference in tampering with the minutes of the meeting, confusing right and wrong, distorting the true situation of the meeting, and expanding the propaganda for the US plot to antagonize the Chinese people. We believe that the full text of each speech by Ambassador Pan Zili, head of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, must be accurately and completely published in the report of the 19th International Red Cross Conference, and the list of members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the so-called illegal "Resolution 36" must be deleted from the report.

The Chinese Red Cross has always been willing to cooperate with various Red Cross organizations in the cause of maintaining peace and humanitarianism. However, if the relevant responsible parties of the International Red Cross Conference continue to undermine the principles of international cooperation, harm the interests of the Chinese people, and persist in their mistakes, it will inevitably jeopardize the cooperative relationship between the Chinese Red Cross and international Red Cross organizations, and block the possibility of the government and the Red Cross of the People's Republic of China participating in future International Red Cross Conferences.

    国际红十字大会追随美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋
    李德全致函提出强硬抗议
    新华社3日讯　中国红十字会会长李德全最近写信给国际红十字常设委员会主席弗朗索瓦·庞赛，就最近出版的第十九届国际红十字大会报告书为美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋服务一事提出强硬抗议。抗议信全文如下：国际红十字常设委员会主席弗朗索瓦·庞赛先生：
    我受中华人民共和国政府委托并代表中国红十字会对第十九届国际红十字大会的报告书掩盖美国制造“两个中国”阴谋、歪曲和诬蔑中国代表团的正义斗争提出严重抗议，并且声明这部报告书是完全不能接受的。
    美国政府在第十九届国际红十字大会上公开制造“两个中国”阴谋的罪恶行为已经使国际红十字活动遭受严重的损害。现在大会有关负责方面没有接受第十九届国际红十字大会的教训，也没有接受中华人民共和国代表团在大会后一再提出的严正要求，正确地处理第十九届国际红十字大会的报告书，以消除美国所造成的恶劣影响。第十九届国际红十字大会报告书一方面对中华人民共和国代表团团长潘自力大使的发言任意加以删割，抹掉中华人民共和国代表对美国阴谋的谴责，另一方面却全文刊登美国政府代表攻击中华人民共和国的谰言，刊载美国强使大会通过的破坏国际红十字章程、制造“两个中国”阴谋的可耻的所谓“第36项”决议。这部报告书甚至把美国代表非法牵进会场的蒋介石集团分子的名单同中华人民共和国代表的名单并列。中国红十字会坚决反对大会有关负责方面篡改会议记录、混淆是非，歪曲会议真实情况，为美国敌视中国人民的阴谋作扩大宣传的行为。我们认为中华人民共和国政府代表团团长潘自力大使的各次发言的全文必须正确无误地刊载于第十九届国际红十字大会报告书，蒋介石集团分子的名单和所谓“第36项”非法决议必须从报告书中删去。
    中国红十字会始终愿意同各红十字会组织在维护和平和人道的事业中进行合作。但是如果国际红十字大会有关负责方面继续破坏国际合作的准则，损害中国人民的利益，坚持错误，就势必危害中国红十字会同国际红十字组织的合作关系，并且阻塞中华人民共和国政府和红十字会今后参加国际红十字大会的可能。
            中国红十字会会长　李德全
                  1960年9月18日于北京
