Xinhua News Agency, 18th (October), New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly concluded its general debate yesterday. The Assembly declared a temporary adjournment without a fixed date, and the Political Committee will hold a meeting on the 19th.

	In yesterday's meeting, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld delivered a speech, sophistically defending the condemnation made by many representatives during the Assembly's debate against the imperialist bloc headed by the United States for stealing the United Nations flag and brutally interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo. Hammarskjöld insisted that the United Nations troops and personnel went to the Congo "to serve, not to rule." He admitted that a "UN force" of nearly 20,000 had replaced the Congolese national army and become the ruling force in the Congo. He opposed the suggestion made by many representatives to withdraw the "UN force," which is completely controlled by the United States, from the Congo and let the Congolese national security forces maintain domestic order. He said, "For its (the UN force's) mission, this force is weak." Hammarskjöld insisted that continuing to use the United Nations as a tool for aggression against the Congo was "absolutely vital," and he also demanded that other United Nations agencies provide their full capabilities for this aggression.

	Cypriot representative Rossides then spoke. He said that Cyprus would pursue an independent course and would not participate in this or that bloc. He also said that in an era of rule by force, the complete liberation of people of all countries is urgent because there can be no lasting peace when human freedom and dignity are still being suppressed. However, Rossides supported the United Nations Emergency Meeting's decision on the Congo issue and United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's actions in the Congo.

	The head of the Indian delegation, Indian Defense Minister Menon, also spoke at the meeting. On the one hand, he claimed that the task of maintaining domestic order in the Congo should be handed over to the Congolese people themselves, and that the Congolese parliament must be allowed to meet without further obstacles, while at the same time emphasizing that all assistance to the Congo must be channeled through the United Nations.

	When talking about the situation in Laos, Menon did not mention US Assistant Secretary of State Parsons's frantic interference in Laos's internal affairs, but only expressed a request that "major powers or countries participating in the Cold War" not interfere in Laos's political situation. Menon said, "As long as they (the Lao people) do not violate the Geneva Accords, they should not be interfered with." However, Menon also advocated revoking the Armistice Supervision Commission established in Laos under the 1954 Geneva Accords, saying that this commission was a "source of irritation" for Laos.

	Menon demanded that continued disarmament negotiations be guaranteed. On this issue, he said that speeches on disarmament negotiations had been used as weapons of the Cold War, hindering further development of disarmament negotiations. He said this was a "dangerous gamble." He did not condemn the stubborn obstructionist attitude of the Western countries headed by the United States on the disarmament issue.

	That day, the General Assembly passed a proposal put forward by twenty-eight Asian, African, and Latin American countries, including India, calling for "cooperation among members of the United Nations." This proposal required United Nations member states not to take steps that might exacerbate international tensions and promote world peace and progress. This proposal was adopted unanimously by the General Assembly.

	Soviet representative Zorin, in explaining the reasons for the Soviet delegation's vote in favor of this proposal, said that the Soviet government has consistently advocated easing international tensions and improving international relations. Regrettably, the Western countries headed by the United States are still pursuing a policy of exacerbating rather than easing international tensions. The United States and its military allies continue to intensify the arms race and are trying to create more and more obstacles on the road to reaching a disarmament agreement. They are still adhering to this line at this session of the General Assembly.

	Zorin said that in order to realize the wish of the countries that put forward the proposal to ease the international situation, the United States must first abandon its policy of provocation and undermining the sovereignty of other countries, truly show sincerity in solving international problems, and promote the easing of international tensions.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, 15th (October), New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly continued its general political debate on the 14th.

	Half of the seats in the meeting hall were empty, and many delegations did not send representatives to attend. Some delegations had only one representative attending the meeting. The first speaker at the meeting was South African Foreign Minister Eric Louw, who in that empty hall, wantonly attacked socialist countries, saying that "communist influence" was "penetrating" into Africa, clamoring that his country had "sufficient reason" to express "anxiety" about this. He tried his best to defend the fascist rule implemented by his government at home, attempting to portray it as almost the "most humanitarian" policy. He also wantonly attacked many African countries because they demanded condemnation of South Africa's fascist system.

	Representatives from El Salvador and Costa Rica also spoke at yesterday's meeting. Costa Rican representative Martin talked about the economic difficulties faced by Latin American countries. He complained about the exploitation of Latin American countries by developed capitalist countries. He pointed out that the prices of industrial products imported by Latin American countries are increasing day by day, while the prices of agricultural raw materials they export are decreasing day by day.

	Representatives from Lebanon, Colombia, and Liberia conducted rebuttals at the meeting in accordance with the rules of procedure. Then the meeting adjourned until the 17th.

    联大结束一般性辩论
    新华社18日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会在昨天结束了一般性辩论。大会宣告暂时无定期休会，19日将举行政治委员会会议。
    在昨天的会议上，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德发表了演说，就大会辩论过程中许多代表对以美国为首的帝国主义集团盗用联合国旗帜，野蛮干涉刚果内政的行动所提出的谴责进行了狡辩。哈马舍尔德硬说联合国军队和人员到刚果是“去服务而不是去统治”。他承认，一支将近两万人的“联合国军”已经取代了刚果的国家军队而成了刚果的统治力量。他反对许多代表提出的把完全受美国控制的“联合国军”撤出刚果，由刚果国家保安部队来维持国内治安的建议，他说，“对它（联合国军队）的任务来说，这支部队是薄弱的。”哈马舍尔德坚持，继续把联合国作为侵略刚果的工具是“断然重要”的，他并且要求联合国其他机构也为这种侵略行动提供它们全部的能力。
    塞浦路斯代表罗西迪斯接着发言。他说，塞浦路斯将奉行独立的路线，不参加这个或那个集团。他还说，在武力统治的时代，各国人民的彻底解放是迫不容缓的，因为当人的自由和尊严还在受压制的时候，是不可能有稳固的和平的。但是罗西迪斯支持联合国紧急会议关于刚果问题的决定和联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在刚果的行动。
    印度代表团团长、印度国防部长梅农也在会上发了言。他一方面声称把维持刚果国内治安的任务交给刚果人民自己去做，必须使刚果的议会在没有进一步障碍的情况下举行会议，同时又强调对刚果的一切援助必须通过联合国。
    谈到老挝局势时，梅农没有谈到美国助理国务卿帕森斯正在进行的对老挝内政的疯狂干涉，而只是表示要求“大国或参加冷战的国家”不要干涉老挝的政局。梅农说，“只要他们（老挝人）不违反日内瓦协议，就不能干涉他们”。然而梅农同时又主张撤销根据1954年日内瓦协议在老挝成立的停战监督委员会，说什么这个委员会对老挝是一种“刺激的源泉”。
    梅农要求保证继续裁军谈判。他在这个问题上说，关于裁军谈判的发言已经被用来作为冷战的武器，妨碍裁军谈判进一步发展。他说这是“危险的赌博”。他没有谴责以美国为首的西方国家在裁军问题上的顽固的阻挠态度。
    这一天大会通过了包括印度在内的二十八个亚、非和拉丁美洲国家提出的呼吁“联合国会员国合作”的一项提案。这项提案要求联合国会员国不采取可能加剧国际紧张局势和促进世界和平和进步的步骤。这项提案得到大会一致通过。
    苏联代表佐林在阐明苏联代表团投票支持这项提案的理由时说，苏联政府始终不渝地主张缓和国际紧张局势和改善国际关系。遗憾的是，以美国为首的西方国家仍然奉行着加剧而不是缓和国际紧张局势的政策。美国和它的军事盟国继续在加紧军备竞赛，正在设法在达成裁军协议的道路上制造越来越多的障碍。在本届联大会议上他们仍然坚持这样的路线。
    佐林说，为了实现提案提出国对缓和国际局势的愿望，首先必须使美国放弃挑衅和破坏其他国家主权的政策，对解决国际问题真正表现出诚意，并促进国际紧张局势的缓和。
    据新华社15日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会14日继续进行一般性政治辩论。
    会议大厅的座席有一半空的，许多代表团都没有派代表出席，有些代表团只有一个代表出席会议。在会议上首先发言的是南非联邦外交部长埃里克·劳，他在那个空荡荡的大厅里大肆攻击社会主义国家，说什么“共产主义影响”正在对非洲进行“渗透”，叫嚷说他的国家有“充分的理由”对此表示“忧惧”。他竭力为他的政府在国内所施行的法西斯统治辩护，企图把它描绘成几乎是“最人道主义”的政策。他并且肆意攻击许多非洲国家，因为它们要求谴责南非的法西斯制度。
    萨尔瓦多和哥斯达黎加代表也在昨天会议上发言。哥斯达黎加代表马丁谈到拉丁美洲各国经济所遭到的困难。他抱怨发达的资本主义国家对拉丁美洲国家所进行的剥削。他指出，拉丁美洲国家进口工业品的价格正在日益上涨，而它们输出的农业原料价格却日益下降。
    黎巴嫩、哥伦比亚、利比里亚代表按照议事规则在会上进行了答辩。接着会议宣布休会到17日再举行。
