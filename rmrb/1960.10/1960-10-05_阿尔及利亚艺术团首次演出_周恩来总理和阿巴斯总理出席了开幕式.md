Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The Algerian Art Troupe from the heroic land gave its first performance in China tonight at the CPPCC Auditorium in the capital. The actors of this art troupe, which grew up in battle, expressed the Algerian people's love for their motherland and their desire for independence, freedom, and liberation through their unique and beautiful national music and dance, as well as their tenacious fighting will and firm belief in victory against imperialist aggression. They were warmly welcomed by more than 1,400 spectators. The Chinese-African People's Friendship Association and the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries solemnly held an opening ceremony for the Algerian Art Troupe's debut performance.

    Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Abbas Ferhat attended the opening ceremony. As the two premiers entered the venue, prolonged and warm applause resounded throughout the hall.

    Those attending tonight's opening ceremony included: Vice Premier of the State Council He Long, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Burhan, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Zhang Xiruo, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Li Qiang, and President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association Chu Tunan.

    Also attending the opening ceremony were diplomatic envoys of various countries to China, as well as African and Arab guests in Beijing.

    During the intermission, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo met with the heads of the art troupe and all its members. After the performance, Premier Zhou Enlai and others went on stage to congratulate them on their successful performance.

    Liu Changsheng, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, delivered a speech at today's opening ceremony. He first extended the warmest welcome to Prime Minister Abbas Ferhat and all friends of the Algerian Art Troupe, and paid the highest tribute to the heroic Algerian people who are persevering in their unyielding struggle for national liberation. He said: The valiant and tenacious Algerian National Liberation Army, with the support and cooperation of the people throughout the country, has continuously inflicted heavy blows on the French colonial army, supported by American imperialism and the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, for six years, liberated vast territories, established revolutionary base areas, and achieved a series of brilliant victories, powerfully supporting the African people's struggle for national independence, setting a glorious example for the national liberation movements of colonial peoples, and making a major contribution to the defense of world peace. Subsequently, Liu Changsheng listed the recent evil deeds of American imperialism, which, under the banner of the United Nations, has been carrying out large-scale division, subversion, and annexation of the Republic of Congo; and its conspiratorial activities in Asia to plot the subversion and interference in Laos, and in Latin America to carry out subversion and interference in Cuba, illustrating that American imperialism is the common and most ferocious enemy of the African people and the people of the world. He said: The Chinese people resolutely support the Algerian people's and the African people's struggle for national independence. Afa Abdul Mati, head of the Algerian Art Troupe, said in his speech at the opening ceremony that the Algerian people felt friendship and admiration for the heroic Chinese people, and believed that the meeting and handshake between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Abbas Ferhat was a symbol of the two nations solidifying their friendship. He said that this friendship will become the traditional friendship between the two peoples.

    Afa Abdul Mati introduced the growth of the art troupe. He said: The Algerian Art Troupe is a part of the fighting Algeria. These amateur artists from the guerrilla forces have been involved in the people's revolutionary movement under the leadership of the Algerian Provisional Government since the establishment of the troupe, using art to reflect and encourage the people's fighting will. They perform for the heroic soldiers of the National Liberation Army in a fighting posture, and introduce to Algerian friends certain aspects of Algerian culture and folk art that are preserved in the depths of the hearts of all Algerian people.

    The Algerian Art Troupe performed the song and dance drama "Towards the Light" and the three-act drama "Immortal Man" tonight, which comprehensively introduced Algeria's music and dance art, reflected the current fighting life of the Algerian people, and demonstrated the strong will of the Algerian people to fight against colonialism and imperialism for national liberation.
