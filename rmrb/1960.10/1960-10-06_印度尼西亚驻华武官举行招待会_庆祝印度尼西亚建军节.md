He extended warm congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the Indonesian Armed Forces on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

General Yang Chengwu said that the Indonesian people, after a long and arduous struggle, finally gained independence and established the Republic of Indonesia. For fifteen years, the Indonesian people and army have been safeguarding their national independence and opposing imperialist aggression and interference, and have been persisting in the just struggle to recover their territory of West Irian. The Chinese people deeply sympathize with and admire this. He said that the Chinese people, who have also suffered from imperialist oppression for a long time, and the fact that U.S. imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan, we have always resolutely and warmly supported this just struggle of the Indonesian people.

Therefore, we highly value the friendship between our two peoples and armies, which is in line with the wishes and fundamental interests of our two peoples.

Colonel Soedjono spoke at the beginning of the reception. After recounting the history of the birth and role of the armed forces of the Republic of Indonesia, he said that part of Indonesian territory is still under Dutch occupation, and our armed forces have been striving to recover West Irian.

Colonel Soedjono said that the Indonesian armed forces are deeply grateful for the concern and sympathy expressed by friendly countries, especially the People's Republic of China, regarding the Indonesian people's struggle to recover West Irian. He said: We have not forgotten the sympathy and assistance given by the People's Republic of China to the Indonesian armed forces in the past. We also express our deep sympathy for the struggle of the people and armed forces of the People's Republic of China to recover Taiwan.
