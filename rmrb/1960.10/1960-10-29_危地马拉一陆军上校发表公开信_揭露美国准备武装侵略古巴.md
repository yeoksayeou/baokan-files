Xinhua News Agency, October 26th, Guatemala City: The Guatemalan newspaper "Prensa Libre" recently published an open letter written by Army Colonel Carlos Paz Tejada, exposing the United States' collusion with the Ydígoras government of Guatemala in preparing for armed aggression against Cuba in Guatemala. The letter stated that all news regarding the so-called Cuban government's attempts to interfere in Guatemala were fabricated with the aim of creating a pretext for the anti-Cuban aggression being prepared in Guatemala. In the letter, Paz Tejada revealed with specific materials that the United States was turning Guatemala into a base for aggression against Cuba. The letter pointed out that a secret foreign military and air base has been established on the El Helvia estate, which belongs to Ydígoras but is owned under the name of his confidant, Alejos. Military projects aimed at launching an aggression against Cuba are under construction there, and an armed corps composed of foreigners and some Guatemalan mercenaries is stationed there. Paz Tejada condemned that the Guatemalan people are forbidden from passing outside the estate, just as one would see in a country occupied by foreign troops.

    危地马拉一陆军上校发表公开信
    揭露美国准备武装侵略古巴
    新华社26日讯　危地马拉城消息：危地马拉的“自由新闻报”最近发表了陆军上校卡洛斯·帕斯·特哈达写的一封公开信，揭露美国勾结危地马拉的伊迪戈拉斯政府在危地马拉进行武装侵略古巴的准备工作。这封信说，关于所谓古巴政府企图干涉危地马拉的一切消息都是捏造的，其目的在于为正在危地马拉准备的反古巴的侵略制造借口。帕斯·特哈达在这封信中以具体材料揭露美国正在把危地马拉变成侵略古巴的基地。信中指出，已经在属于伊迪戈拉斯的、但以他的心腹阿莱霍斯的名义拥有的埃耳维的亚庄园里，建立了一个秘密的外国军事和空军基地。那里正在建设目的在于发动对古巴的侵略的军事工程，并且驻有一个由外国人和一些危地马拉雇佣兵组成的武装兵团。帕斯·特哈达谴责说，危地马拉人民被禁止从庄园外通行，就好像人们在外国军队占领下的国家中所见到的情形一样。
