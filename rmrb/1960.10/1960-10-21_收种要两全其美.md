    Harvesting and Planting Must Both Be Satisfactory

    The growth of crops follows certain laws, which people cannot violate. However, people can understand the laws of crop growth and use them to promote early maturity and high yields, freeing up land for wheat planting, and striving for both a good autumn harvest and timely autumn planting. The Majiawan Management Area of Gaoling Commune is doing just that. Based on the characteristics of crop growth this year, they have classified and ranked crops by plot, stubble, and variety, and adopted three sets of measures: harvesting and planting quickly for mature crops, promoting maturity and rushing planting for immature crops, and intercropping for late-maturing crops, effectively resolving the contradiction between good harvesting and good planting. Because they have grasped the laws of crop growth and given full play to people's subjective initiative, they have won the initiative in production, thereby laying the foundation for more grain this year and more grain next year.

    Timely harvesting and planting are crucial, especially for wheat planting; missing the timing will seriously affect next year's yield. How can we achieve timely harvesting and planting? Qiao Xinglong, the Party Secretary of Majiawan Management Area, has set an example by going deep into the fields, mobilizing the masses, understanding the situation, and coming up with solutions.

    收种要两全其美
    作物的生长，都有它一定的规律，人们不能违背。但是，人们可以认识作物生长的规律，可以利用它促使作物早熟高产，腾地种麦，力争秋收秋种两全其美。高陵公社马家湾管理区就是这样做的，他们根据今年作物生长的特点，按地块、茬口、品种进行分类排队，采取三套措施：成熟的快收快种，未熟的促熟抢种，晚熟的倒茬套种，有效地解决了收好和种好的矛盾。由于掌握了作物生长规律，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，赢得了在生产上的主动权，从而为今年多打粮、明年多收粮打下了基础。
    秋收秋种贵在适时。特别是种麦，错过时机，就会严重影响来年的产量。怎样做到适时收种？马家湾管理区党委书记乔兴隆做出了榜样，那就是深入田间，发动群众，摸清情况，拿出办法。
