Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, October 28th: The roads, bridges, culverts, and rainwater drainage pipeline project built in Ulaanbaatar with China's assistance to the Mongolian People's Republic have been completed. The handover ceremony and mass celebration rally were held here on the 27th.

　　This is the last project under the agreement signed in 1956 regarding China's economic and technical assistance to Mongolia, which China is providing without compensation. The project includes eleven roads with a total area of over 495,000 square meters, four reinforced concrete bridges, twenty-three culverts, and more than 9,400 meters of rainwater drainage pipelines. Construction began in June 1957 and was completed in September this year.

　　Mongolian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Maidar, First Secretary of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party Ulaanbaatar City Committee Lubsanrabdan, Chairman of the State Planning Committee Ragcha, Chairman of the Foreign Economic Liaison Committee Barjide, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Chimid Dorji, and all members of the Chinese and Mongolian government delegations attended the handover ceremony.

　　The head of the Chinese government delegation, Zhao Jin, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia, and the head of the Mongolian government delegation, Bataa, Mayor of Ulaanbaatar, signed the handover certificate.

　　In the afternoon of the same day, a mass celebration rally was held next to the newly built road on Stalin Avenue. Bataa and Zhao Jin spoke at the meeting.

　　Bataa said that the highway and rainwater drainage pipeline project built in Ulaanbaatar with China's uncompensated assistance is a new proof that economic and cultural cooperation and mutual support between China and Mongolia are expanding and developing. He added that Chinese construction workers worked creatively under Mongolia's harsh natural conditions and successfully completed the road construction project. The citizens of Ulaanbaatar express their gratitude for this. He also extended warm respects to the Chinese government, the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and all the Chinese people.

　　Zhao Jin said that the Ulaanbaatar city roads, bridges, and rainwater drainage pipeline project built with China's assistance to Mongolia is the glorious fruit of the friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples. We hope that the completion of this project can play its due role in the ever-developing transportation cause of Ulaanbaator.

　　He said, we firmly believe that the profound friendship and friendly cooperation between our two countries, based upon Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, will be expanded and consolidated day by day.

　　The Presidium of the Great People's Hural and the government of Mongolia awarded medals, badges, and certificates to one hundred and fifty Chinese workers who built the highway.
