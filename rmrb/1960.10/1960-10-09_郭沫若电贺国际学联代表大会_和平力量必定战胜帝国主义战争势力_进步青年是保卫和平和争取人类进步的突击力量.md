Xinhua News Agency, October 8th – Guo Moruo sent a telegram on the 7th to the Sixth Congress of the International Union of Students, recently convened in Baghdad, congratulating the congress on its success.

The telegram stated that youth are the future and hope of the world. In the struggle to defend world peace and strive for human progress, progressive young students are an assault force. We are pleased to see that in the current national democratic movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and its running dogs, and in the struggle of the peoples of all countries to win peace, democracy, oppose the intensification of arms expansion and war preparations by U.S. imperialism, demand universal disarmament, prohibit nuclear weapons, and ease international tensions, youth and students stand at the forefront of the struggle. I believe that your congress will surely reflect the universal aspirations and demands of the people and young students of all countries to defend peace, oppose imperialism, strive for national independence, and defend democratic rights.

The telegram pointed out that currently, the international situation is extremely favorable to the struggle for peace. A broad united front against U.S.-led imperialism and in defense of world peace is taking shape. As long as the people of all countries in the world strengthen their unity, remain vigilant against the aggressive and war plots of U.S. imperialism, and wage persistent struggles, the forces of peace will ultimately defeat the forces of imperialist war, and the cause of the people of all countries to strive for peace, national independence, democracy, and social progress will surely achieve final victory.

    郭沫若电贺国际学联代表大会
    和平力量必定战胜帝国主义战争势力
    进步青年是保卫和平和争取人类进步的突击力量
    新华社8日讯　郭沫若7日打电报给近日在巴格达召开的国际学生联合会第六届代表大会，祝贺大会成功。
    电报说，青年是世界的未来和希望。在保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的斗争中，进步的青年学生更是一支突击的力量。我们高兴地看到，在当前亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的民族民主运动和各国人民争取和平、民主、反对美帝国主义加紧扩军备战、要求普遍裁军、禁止核武器和缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中，青年和学生站在斗争的前列。我相信，你们的大会一定会反映世界各国人民和青年学生保卫和平、反对帝国主义、争取民族独立和保卫民主权利的普遍愿望和要求。
    电报指出，目前，国际形势是极有利于争取和平的斗争的。一个反对以美国为首的帝国主义、保卫世界和平的广泛统一战线正在形成，只要全世界各国人民加强团结，对美帝国主义的侵略和战争阴谋保持警惕和进行坚持不懈的斗争，和平力量最后必定战胜帝国主义战争势力，各国人民争取和平、民族独立、民主和社会进步的事业必将获得最后的胜利。
