This newspaper Tianjin, 28th dispatch: Hebei Province's metallurgical system's conservation of raw coal and coke to promote steel production has formed a broad mass movement. The broad masses of workers have established the idea of "loving coal as they love grain," and through vigorously carrying out technical innovation, conservation and substitution, improving enterprise management, and other methods, they have continuously reduced coking coal consumption and ironmaking coke ratio. The province's blast furnace ironmaking coke ratio and charging coke ratio in late August decreased by 5.3% and 6.9% respectively compared with early and mid-August. In September, it decreased by 15.1% and 12.3% respectively compared with August. Since entering October, there has been a large decrease. At the same time, the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces and the qualified rate of pig iron have also continued to increase. In the short two months from late August to mid-October, the province saved more than 250,000 tons of coking coal, enough to increase production by about 100,000 tons of pig iron.

In the vigorously developing production increase and conservation movement, the Hebei Province metallurgical system regards saving coking coal as an important measure to increase steel production. In mid-August, after the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to all industries in the province to save raw coal and coke, the metallurgical system immediately took action. From the province to the city and county, to every coking plant and iron plant, leadership organizations for saving coking coal were generally established. Leading cadres at all levels went deep into the front line of production, explained the situation, assigned tasks, and talked about the significance. Through airing opinions, discussions, and forums, the broad masses of workers were given ideological education on "loving coal as they love grain," so that the broad masses of workers firmly established the idea of building the country with diligence and thrift, and running enterprises with diligence and thrift. Each workshop and each blast furnace (coke oven) of each coal washing, coking, and ironmaking plant, down to each class, group, and worker, calculated detailed accounts, plugged loopholes in every possible way, tapped potential, and formulated advanced indicators and specific measures for saving coking coal at all levels. A mass upsurge of using less coal and producing more coke, and using less coke and producing more iron, quickly formed. Since September, four iron plants in Handan City, such as Wu'an and Hongxing, have drawn more than 100 leading cadres to go deep into the grassroots level, to backward units with higher coking coal consumption, to specifically help analyze the reasons, take measures, and break through the key points, so that most of the backward units quickly caught up with the advanced. Workers at the Linshui Iron Plant have formulated advanced conservation indicators for each of the five links of raw coal crushing, screening, transportation, and batching, and carried out activities such as eliminating pests and impurities and reducing coke processing losses, so that all raw materials such as charging coke and ore are dry, clean, uniform, and of high grade. Therefore, since September, the coke ratio of the whole plant has been significantly reduced. The Handan Fuyang Iron Plant has paid close attention to the management of raw materials such as coke. The factory party committee has transferred one-half of the leading cadres to work as deputy leaders in the raw material workshop. The party branch secretary and the blast furnace foreman personally check the raw materials charged into each blast furnace, ensuring that the small blast furnace eats cooked grain and fine grain. In September, the coke consumption per ton of iron produced was reduced by 19% compared with August, and in early and mid-October, it was reduced by 1.5% compared with September.

The broad masses of workers in the Hebei Province metallurgical system, focusing on reducing coal consumption and coke ratio, have carried out extensive and in-depth technical innovation and technical revolution movements, summed up and promoted effective advanced experiences in saving coking coal, and promoted the continuous decline of coke ratio and coal consumption. On the basis of improving understanding, the workers of Shijiazhuang Zhengding Coking Plant have put forward suggestions and carried out innovations around the key of production, and successfully used multiple dewatering and coal washing methods, so that the recovery rate of refined coal has increased from 60% to 75.8%. The four coking plants in this city immediately promoted this experience, and the coal consumption per ton of coke in September was generally reduced by 6% to 16%. At present, one-third of the coking plants in the province have promoted the experience of multiple dewatering and coal washing, and the recovery rate of refined coal has generally increased by 4% to 6%. After the Fengfeng Coal Mine No. 1 Mine Coking Plant in Handan City created the advanced experience of using a variety of small kiln low-quality coal to make high-quality coke and saving a lot of coking coal, the workers of the local Su Feng Coking Plant immediately learned their experience, and created methods such as closing the fire to block the door and adding water to assist combustion in operation. Not only did they save coking coal, but the production level also improved rapidly. The coking rate of coking refined coal with low-quality coal reached 75% from small hundred-ton coke ovens to large thousand-ton coke ovens, and the coking time was generally shortened by three to five days. In order to promote the advanced experience in a timely manner, the Hebei Province metallurgical department also conscientiously summarized the six advanced experiences of Zhengding, Zhangjiabao, Baoding, Qinhuangdao and other iron plants and coking plants in September, such as heavy-load operation, multi-channel dewatering of coal washing, good coke refining of secondary coal, and improvement of soil coke quality, and transferred the furnace foremen and technical workers of these plants to form an experience dissemination group, which went to Handan, Tangshan, Chengde and other places to teach on the spot. The promotion of advanced experience has greatly promoted the technical transformation of small blast furnaces, creating favorable conditions for the universal realization of large air volume, high temperature and heavy load operation and reduction of charging coke ratio in the province's iron plants. Of the 400 sets of fans planned for the renovation of small blast furnaces in the province, 219 sets have been put into production. After 37 sets of fans from seven iron plants in Zhangjiakou area were put into production, and hot blast stoves were added and rebuilt, the average coke consumption per ton of iron (total coke ratio) in September was 540 kg lower than in August.

In the mass movement to save coking coal and coke, all localities also gathered sporadic and scattered experiences and incorporated them into regulations, so that enterprise management continued to improve, effectively promoting the development of the production increase and conservation movement. In response to the key issue of saving coking coal as the key to increasing pig iron production, the workers of Shijiazhuang Zhengding Iron Plant summarized and summarized the past single management experiences in furnace-based production, production-based materials, and material yards, furnace front, coke transportation, and crushing into a "quota contracting" management system for coal and coke. From the raw coal entering the plant, coal washing, coking, quenching coke, handling, crushing, storage and other links, consumption quotas and specific measures to achieve the quotas are formulated, and the quota indicators are implemented from the furnace, class (group) to each worker, so that everyone in the factory has a consumption quota account. Since September, they have saved more than 2,000 tons of coking coal, and used it to increase pig iron production by more than 1,600 tons. This "quota contracting" management experience centered on saving coking coal has been widely promoted in the metallurgical systems of Shijiazhuang, Handan, Zhangjiakou, Baoding and other places in Hebei Province.

    抓节约焦煤  促钢铁增产
    河北冶金系统职工“爱煤如爱粮”不断降低炼焦煤耗炼铁焦比
    注意收集零星点滴经验大搞技术革命运动不断改进企业管理
    本报天津28日电　河北省冶金系统节约原煤焦炭促进钢铁增产形成广泛的群众性运动。广大职工树立了“爱煤如粮”的思想，通过大搞技术革新、节约代用、改进企业管理等方法，不断减低炼焦煤耗、炼铁焦比。全省8月下旬高炉炼铁全焦比和入炉焦比，比8月上旬、中旬分别降低5.3％和6.9％，9月份又比8月份分别降低15.1％和12.3％，进入10月份以来，又有很大降低；同时，高炉利用系数和生铁合格率也随之不断提高。从8月下旬到10月中旬的短短两个月中，全省共节约焦煤二十五万多吨，足供增产约十万吨生铁之用。
    在蓬勃发展的增产节约运动中，河北省冶金系统把节约焦煤当作增产钢铁的一项重要措施。8月中旬，中共河北省委向全省各个行业发出节约原煤、焦炭的号召之后，冶金系统就立即行动起来。从省到市、县，到每一个焦厂、铁厂，普遍成立了节约焦煤的领导机构，各级领导干部深入生产第一线，讲形势，交任务，谈意义，并通过鸣放、讨论、座谈，向广大职工进行了“爱煤如粮”的思想教育，使广大职工牢固地树立起勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的思想。各洗煤、炼焦、炼铁厂的每个车间、每座高炉（焦炉），直到各班、小组和工人，纷纷算细账、堵漏洞，千方百计挖潜力，层层制订节约焦煤的先进指标和具体措施，迅速形成了群众性的少用煤、多炼焦，少用焦、多炼铁的节约焦煤热潮。邯郸市武安、红星等四个炼铁厂从9月份以来，抽出一百多名领导干部深入基层，到消耗焦煤较多的后进单位，具体帮助分析原因，采取措施，突破关键，使大部分后进单位迅速赶上先进。临水铁厂职工，在原煤破碎、过筛、运输、配料等五个环节上，环环订出先进节约指标，开展除害灭杂、降低焦炭加工损耗等活动，使入炉焦炭、矿石等原料全部作到干、净、匀、品位高，因此，9月份以来，全厂焦比显著降低。邯郸滏阳炼铁厂大抓焦炭等原料管理工作，厂党委抽调了二分之一的领导干部，下放到原料车间担任领导副职，每座高炉有党总支书记和高炉炉长亲自检查入炉原料，保证了小高炉吃到熟料细粮，9月份每炼一吨铁的焦炭消耗就比8月份降低了19％，10月上、中旬又比9月份降低1.5％。
    河北省冶金系统的广大职工，围绕着降低煤耗、焦比，开展了广泛、深入的技术革新和技术革命运动，总结和推广了行之有效的节约焦煤的先进经验，促进了焦比、煤耗不断下降。石家庄正定炼焦厂职工在提高认识的基础上，围绕生产关键，纷纷提建议搞革新，成功地使用了多道脱水洗煤方法，使精煤回收率由60％上升到75.8％。这个市四座炼焦厂立即推广这一经验，9月份每吨焦耗煤量普遍降低了6％至16％。目前，全省已有三分之一的焦厂推广了多道脱水洗煤经验，精煤回收率普遍提高了4％至6％。邯郸市峰峰煤矿一矿炼焦厂，创造了用多种小窑低质煤炼成优质焦，并且大量节约焦煤的先进经验后，当地宿凤炼焦厂职工立即学习了他们的经验，并且在操作上创造了闭火堵门和加水助燃等方法，不仅节约了焦煤，生产水平也迅速提高，全厂从百吨的小焦窑到上千吨的大焦炉，用低质煤炼焦精煤的结焦率达到75％，结焦时间普遍缩短了三至五天。河北省冶金部门为了把先进经验及时推广，在9月间还认真总结了正定、张家堡、保定、秦皇岛等铁厂、焦厂的重负荷操作，洗煤多道脱水，次煤炼好焦，提高土焦质量等六项先进经验，并且抽调这些厂的炉长、技术工人，组成经验传播团，分赴邯郸、唐山、承德等地现场传授。先进经验的推广，大大促进了小高炉的技术改造，为在全省铁厂普遍实现大风高温重负荷操作，降低入炉焦比创造了有利条件。全省计划为小高炉改造用的四百套风机，目前已有二百一十九套投入生产。张家口地区七座铁厂三十七套风机投入生产，并且增设和改装了热风炉以后，9月份平均每吨铁耗用焦炭（全焦比）就比8月份节约了五百四十公斤。
    在节约焦煤、焦炭的群众运动中，各地还把零星、点滴的经验集中起来，纳入规程，使企业管理不断改进，有效地推动增产节约运动的开展。石家庄正定铁厂职工，针对节约焦煤是增产生铁的关键问题，把过去实行的以炉定产、以产定料和料场、炉前、焦炭运输、破碎等方面的单项管理经验，集中归纳为煤、焦“定额包干”管理制度，从原煤进厂、洗煤、炼焦、熄焦、搬运、破碎、保管等各个环节上，订出消耗定额和实现定额的具体措施，并且定额指标从炉、班（组）一直落实到每个工人，使全厂人人都有一本消耗定额账。9月份以来，他们已经节约了二千多吨焦煤，用它增产了生铁一千六百多吨。这个以节约焦煤为中心的“定额包干”管理经验，已经在河北省石家庄、邯郸、张家口、保定等地冶金系统普遍推广。（附图片）
