Our newspaper, Anshan, October 16th: The workers of various plants and mines in the raw materials system of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have fully utilized their subjective initiative, overcoming difficulties, creating conditions, and achieving increased production measures ahead of schedule, promoting a comprehensive and progressive increase in raw material production.

When discussing the increased production and conservation plan, the workers of various plants and mines in Anshan Iron and Steel's raw material system formulated tens of thousands of guarantee measures related to equipment modification, operational method innovation, promotion of advanced experience, and improvement of management work at all levels, from individuals to teams and groups, from work sections to workshops, to ensure the realization of the planned targets. The early realization of each measure plays an important role in the completion of this year's increased production plan. As soon as the increased production and conservation competition began, the broad masses of workers made every effort to achieve increased production measures ahead of schedule. According to incomplete statistics from nine plants and mines, including Dagushan, Dong'anshan, Gongchangling, Yingtaoyuan Iron Mines, and Anshan Sintering General Plant, more than 3,000 increased production measures of varying sizes have been implemented ahead of schedule from the groups up to the workshops. This adds new guarantees to the timely and over-fulfillment of the entire plant and mine's increased production and conservation plan, and a new situation of continuous production increases has emerged. In late September, ore, concentrate, and sintered ore increased by 8.31%, 0.05%, and 0.19% respectively compared to mid-September. In early October, they increased again compared to late September, with ore increasing by 5.7%, concentrate by 12.35%, and sintered ore by 2.78%. There has been some improvement in mid-October.

In this struggle to achieve measures ahead of schedule, every worker has tried every means to overcome difficulties and strive for the best. In the past, the "Sixty-Three Meter" workshop of the Yingtaoyuan Mine often had to unload the mined ore on the ground because the vehicles were not coordinated in time. When the ore was transported out, it had to be moved again, which was both labor-intensive and time-consuming, and affected production. When discussing the increased production and conservation plan, they decided to build an ore storage bin, but because the design was relatively "foreign," the required materials could not be collected quickly, and it could not be realized quickly. Later, after joint discussion by workshop cadres, workers, and technicians, a local ore storage bin was designed. The mined ore was loaded when there were vehicles, and stored when there were no vehicles, which greatly promoted mining efficiency. Since September, they have overfulfilled the mining plan every day. In the first ten days of September, the workers of the Dagushan ore dressing workshop implemented thirteen increased production measures ahead of schedule in the crushing, ball milling, magnetic separation, and filtration processes. At this time, the production capacity of the original centrifugal slurry pump was obviously not able to adapt to the needs of the production leap. After the equipment maintenance workers learned about it, they found three incomplete old pumps from fraternal units, pieced together the parts, matched them with electric motors, and quickly put them into production. As a result, the daily production level of concentrate in the entire workshop increased sharply by more than 10%.

In the mass process of realizing increased production measures, for measures that a unit could not implement, several groups, several work sections, and several workshops joined together to help each other and support each other through the form of joint tackling, and worked together to realize them ahead of schedule. A considerable part of the concentrate powder needed for production in the sintering workshop of Dong'anshan Iron Mine was transported from other places. In the past, these foreign concentrate powders all relied on manual carrying to the belt conveyor, which far could not meet the needs of production, and material shortage often occurred. Therefore, it was decided to build a belt linkage line, but materials and personnel could not be resolved. The civil construction workshop, mechanical power workshop, and Anshan Transportation Department of the mine all took the initiative to send people and materials to support. During the construction, everyone launched a "three comparisons" red flag competition to compare enthusiasm, quality, and progress, which increased the efficiency of stone masonry by one-third. When cement was insufficient, the workers used their self-produced slag cement to replace it. When there was no steel plate, they found scrap steel plates to replace it. The 500-meter railway laid by the Transportation Department was originally planned to be completed in seven days, but it was completed in only two days. Since then, the sintering machine has obtained a sufficient supply of raw materials, supplying 500 tons more of sintered ore to the blast furnace every day. Through everyone's cooperation and the method of fighting annihilation battles, the workshop realized 103 increased production measures in a short month from groups to workshops, and sintered ore increased sharply by more than 15%.

After the measures of many teams, groups, work sections, and workshops were realized ahead of schedule, they took the initiative to learn from each other and offer treasures between the same posts and the same machine tools through visits and performances, which greatly accelerated the realization of the measures. Low efficiency of the filter was an old problem of the third work section of the magnetic separation workshop of the Sintering General Plant. This time, the workers of the entire work section selected Zhang Engui, Liang Fengquan, and Li Yonglu, three veterans of taming filters, from the three shifts to perform the operational experience of taming filters. Through the performance, they learned from each other's strengths and made up for their weaknesses, and formed a set of operational methods of diligent plugging of eyes, frequent cleaning, and no air leakage, which increased the efficiency of the filter by 30%. As soon as this experience appeared, it was firmly grasped by the workshop leaders and vigorously organized and promoted in the first and second work sections, which generally improved the efficiency of the filter, and the production of concentrate continued to rise. The concentrate output in September increased by 23% compared with August, and the daily production level in early October increased by 29.6% compared with September.

    鞍钢广大职工同心协力战胜困难
    提前实现三千项增产原料措施
    矿石、精矿、烧结矿等原料生产出现逐旬上升大好局面
    本报鞍山16日电　鞍山钢铁公司原料系统各厂矿职工，充分发挥主观能动作用，战胜困难、创造条件，纷纷提前实现增产措施，促进原料生产出现全面逐旬上升的大好局面。
    鞍钢原料系统各厂矿职工在讨论增产节约计划时，为保证计划指标的实现，从个人到班、组，从工段到车间，层层制定了有关改造设备、革新操作方法、推广先进经验、改进管理工作等成千上万项保证措施。每一项措施的提前实现，对今年增产计划的完成都有重要作用。增产节约竞赛一开始，广大职工就为提前实现增产措施进行了千方百计的努力。据大孤山、东鞍山、弓长岭、樱桃园铁矿和鞍山烧结总厂等九个厂矿不完全的统计，目前从小组直至各车间已提前实现大小不同增产措施三千多项，为整个厂矿增产节约计划按时和超额完成增添了新的保证，生产出现了不断上升的新局面。9月下旬矿石、精矿、烧结矿分别比中旬提高8.31％、0.05％、0.19％，10月上旬又比9月下旬增长，其中矿石增长5.7％，精矿增长12.35％，烧结矿增长2.78％。进入中旬又有所提高。
    在这场提前实现措施的斗争里，职工人人想尽办法，战胜困难，力争上游。樱桃园矿“六十三米”车间过去采出矿石，常因车辆配合得不够及时，而不得不把矿石卸在地上；当矿石外运时，又要重新搬运，既费工费时，又影响生产的进行。在讨论增产节约计划时，他们决定建筑一个储矿槽，但因设计比较
  “洋”，所需材料一时凑不足，不能很快实现。后来经过车间干部、工人和技术人员共同讨论，设计出一个土储矿槽之后，采出来的矿石有车就装，无车就储存起来，大大促进了采矿效率，自9月以来天天超额完成采矿计划。大孤山选矿车间职工在9月前十天里，在破碎、球磨、磁选和滤过的各工序提前实现了十三项增产措施。这时，原有离心吸浆泵的生产能力，就显得不能适应生产跃进的需要。设备检修工人知道后，便从兄弟单位找来三台残缺不全的旧泵凑了零件，配了电动机，很快投入了生产。因此全车间精矿日产水平猛增10％以上。
    在群众性的实现增产措施的过程中，对于一个单位无力实现的措施，就几个小组、几个工段、几个车间合起来，通过联合攻关的形式互相帮助，互相支援，齐心协力提前实现。东鞍山铁矿烧结车间生产所需的精矿粉，有相当一部分是从外地运来。在过去，这些外来的精矿粉，全部依靠人工抬到皮带机上去，远远满足不了生产的需要，时常出现待料现象。因此决定建一个皮带连动线，但材料、人员无力解决。这个矿的土建车间、机械动力车间、鞍钢运输部都主动抽人、调料前去支援。在施工当中，大家展开了比干劲、比质量、比进度的“三比”红旗竞赛，使砌石效率提高三分之一；水泥不足，工人就用他们自产的矿渣水泥代替，没有钢板就找来废旧钢板代用。运输部帮助铺设的五百米铁路原计划七天完成，结果仅用两天就铺完了。烧结机从此得到了充足的原料供应，每天多供应高炉五百吨烧结矿。这个车间通过大家协作，打歼灭战的方法，在短短一个月内从小组到车间就实现了一百零三项增产措施，烧结矿猛增15％以上。
    许多班组和工段、车间的措施提前实现后，都主动地通过参观和表演等办法，在同岗位和同机台之间取经献宝，大大加快了措施的实现。滤过机效率低，是烧结总厂磁选车间三工段的老问题。这次全工段职工从三个班当中，选拔出张恩贵、梁风全和李永禄三个驯服滤过机的老将，表演驯服滤过机的操作经验，通过表演取长补短，配成一套勤堵眼、多清扫、不漏风的操作方法，使滤过机效率提高了30％。这套经验一出现，便被车间领导上狠狠抓住，在第一和第二工段大力组织推广，使滤过机效率普遍提高，精矿生产不断上升，9月份的精矿产量比8月提高了23％，10月上旬的日产水平，又比9月份提高了29.6％。
