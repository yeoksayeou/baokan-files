Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 13th: Takeshi Tobe, Central Executive Committee Member of the Japanese Socialist Party and Head of the Japanese Delegation Visiting China from the National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty, issued a written statement to the press in Wuhan today, condemning the US-Japanese reactionaries for condoning fascist thugs in the murder of Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party.

In his statement, Head Tobe pointed out: "The assassination of Chairman Asanuma is a challenge by fascist violent groups to the Japanese people who demand peace and independence. This fascist group is connected to the Ikeda Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party, which are forcefully implementing the new US-Japan Security Treaty."

The statement said: "We are convinced that this atrocity will arouse the anger and rise of the Japanese people. We have decided to return home early to join the ranks of the battle."

The thirteen members of the Japanese Delegation Visiting China from the National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty arrived in Wuhan on the morning of the 12th. After the news of Inejiro Asanuma's murder was received that evening, the delegation immediately held a meeting to condemn this despicable conspiracy of the US-Japanese reactionaries, expressing their determination to transform grief into strength, inherit Asanuma Inejiro's legacy, and continue to strive for the independence, peace, and democratic cause of Japan, and to promote friendly relations between Japan and China. Head Tobe has already taken a train at noon today via Guangzhou to return home first. The other members of the delegation will visit Wuhan and then leave for Shanghai.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 13th: Kenjiro Yanagida, Head of the Japanese Peace Committee Delegation Visiting China, and Tokumatsu Sakamoto, Head of the Japanese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee Delegation Visiting China, who are currently visiting Shenyang, issued statements to Xinhua News Agency reporters today regarding the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, by Japanese fascist thugs, strongly protesting the US-Japanese reactionaries' despicable act of condoning the assassination by thugs, and expressing their intention to turn grief into anger and strength, and to wage repeated and unremitting struggles against the US-Japanese reactionaries.

Both Head Kenjiro Yanagida and Head Tokumatsu Sakamoto expressed deep sorrow and strong anger over the murder of Inejiro Asanuma.

Kenjiro Yanagida said that the occurrence of this incident was not accidental, it has a direct connection with the US-Japan military alliance treaty, it is the first step of concrete action after the passage of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," and it is also the essential manifestation of the reactionary policies of the Ikeda Cabinet. Kenjiro Yanagida pointed out that the US-Japanese reactionaries may also use this opportunity, under the guise of cracking down on violence by left-wing and right-wing groups, to suppress the forces of nationalism, peace, and independence. Kenjiro Yanagida concluded by saying that we must turn grief into anger, and anger into strength, and like the opposition to the US-Japan "Security Treaty," we must conduct repeated and unremitting struggles. In order to achieve the victory of the struggle, we must take unified action, and unite all forces, including workers, peasants, intellectuals, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, and the national bourgeoisie, to carry out dozens or even hundreds of struggles until the Ikeda Cabinet is overthrown and a national coalition government is established.

Tokumatsu Sakamoto said in his statement that Inejiro Asanuma was sacrificed under the daggers of the US-Japanese reactionaries, which demonstrates the fascist elements of the Ikeda Cabinet's policies. We are willing to unite with the people of Asian and African countries to carry out the struggle. On October 8th, we issued a joint statement with the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, which is a statement to strengthen the solidarity of the Asian and African people, support national independence, and oppose imperialism. We will carry out the struggle on the basis of this joint statement, and strongly oppose the fascist policies of the US-Japanese reactionaries and the Ikeda Cabinet.

The Japanese Peace Committee Delegation Visiting China and the Japanese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee Delegation also sent protest telegrams to the Ikeda government this morning. At the same time, the two delegations also sent telegrams to the Japanese Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Japanese Peace Committee, and the Japanese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee and other organizations regarding the murder of Inejiro Asanuma.

    日本三个访华代表团团长就浅沼被害发表声明
    日本人民决心加强团结加强斗争
    坚决反击美日反动派的无耻暴行
    新华社武汉13日电　日本社会党中央执行委员、日本阻止修改安全条约国民会议访华代表团团长户叶武，今天在武汉向报界发表书面声明，谴责美日反动派纵容法西斯暴徒杀害日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎。
    户叶武团长在声明中指出：“浅沼委员长被暗杀是法西斯暴力团体对要求和平和独立的日本人民的挑战。这个法西斯团体是和强硬执行新日美安全条约的池田内阁和自由民主党有联系的。”
    声明说：“我们确信，这种暴行将激起日本人民的愤怒和奋起。我们决定提前回国，参加战斗的行列。”
    日本阻止修改安全条约国民会议访华代表团一行十三人，是在12日上午到达武汉的。当晚浅沼稻次郎被害消息传来后，代表团立即开会，谴责美日反动派这一卑鄙阴谋，表示要化悲痛为力量，继承浅沼稻次郎的遗志，继续为日本的独立、和平和民主事业，为促进日中两国的友好关系而奋斗。户叶武团长已经在今天中午乘火车取道广州先期回国。代表团的其他成员将在武汉参观访问后离开武汉去上海。
    新华社沈阳13日电　正在沈阳访问的日本和平委员会访华代表团团长柳田谦十郎、日本亚非团结委员会访华代表团团长坂本德松，今天就日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎被日本法西斯暴徒杀害事件，向新华社记者发表谈话，强烈抗议美日反动派纵容暴徒刺杀的卑鄙行为，表示要把悲痛变为愤怒和力量，向美日反动派进行反复不懈的斗争。
    柳田谦十郎和坂本德松两位团长都对浅沼稻次郎被害事件表示深切的悲痛和强烈的愤怒。
    柳田谦十郎说，这个事件的发生并不是偶然的，它和日美军事同盟条约有直线的联系，是日美“安全条约”通过后的具体行动的第一步，也是池田内阁的反动政策的本质的表现。柳田谦十郎指出，日美反动派可能还会利用这个机会，以取缔左翼和右翼团体暴力行为为名，来镇压民族、和平、独立的力量。柳田谦十郎最后说，我们要把悲痛转为愤怒，把愤怒变为力量，就像反对日美“安全条约”那样，进行反复不懈的斗争。为了达到斗争的胜利，必须采取统一行动，要把工人、农民、知识分子、社会党、共产党、中小企业家、民族资产阶级这一切力量团结起来，进行几十次甚至于几百次的斗争，一直到打倒池田内阁，建立民族联合政府。
    坂本德松发表谈话说，浅沼稻次郎是牺牲在美日反动派的凶刃下的，这表现了池田内阁政策的法西斯因素。我们愿意和亚非各国人民团结起来进行斗争。10月8日我们同中国亚非团结委员会发表了联合声明，这是加强亚非人民团结、支持民族独立、反对帝国主义的声明。我们将在这个联合声明的基础上来进行斗争，强烈反对美日反动派和池田内阁的法西斯政策。
    日本和平委员会访华代表团和日本亚非团结委员会访华代表团在今天早晨还分别向池田政府发出抗议电。同时，两个代表团还就浅沼稻次郎被杀害事件分别打电报给日本社会党、共产党以及日本工会总评议会、日本和平委员会、日本亚非团结委员会等团体。
