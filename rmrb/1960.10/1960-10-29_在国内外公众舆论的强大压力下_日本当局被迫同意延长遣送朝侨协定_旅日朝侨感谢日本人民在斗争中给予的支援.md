Xinhua News Agency, October 27th, Tokyo Dispatch: Representatives of the Red Cross Societies of Korea and Japan signed an agreement in Niigata City this afternoon to unconditionally extend the agreement on repatriating Korean residents in Japan for one year. The agreement on repatriating Korean residents in Japan, signed last August, will expire on November 12th this year. The Japanese government broke off negotiations on extending this agreement on September 23rd, but, under strong pressure from public opinion at home and abroad, it finally had to agree to unconditionally extend the agreement.

Kim Ju-ryong, spokesman for the Korean Red Cross delegation, gave a press conference after the meeting and released a joint communiqué of both sides, an additional agreement signed by the Korean Red Cross delegation and the Japanese Red Cross delegation, and correspondence concerning the extension of the repatriation agreement. The joint communiqué stated that the Japanese Red Cross and the Korean Red Cross had reached a comprehensive agreement on resolving outstanding issues so that Korean residents in Japan could return to their homeland based on freely expressed wishes.

The additional agreement stipulates that the current agreement on repatriating Korean residents in Japan will be extended until November 12, 1961.

The correspondence stated that both sides had agreed to hold a meeting in Niigata on November 10 to discuss increasing the transportation capacity for repatriating Korean residents.

Kim Ju-ryong said at the press conference that we are very happy to see that a broad road has been opened for Korean residents in Japan to return to their homeland under the leadership of Premier Kim Il-sung.

He said that the Korean Red Cross delegation expresses its gratitude to the Japanese people for treating the repatriation of Korean residents as their own issue and for cooperating with the Korean residents in achieving the extension of the agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, October 27th, Tokyo Dispatch: The headquarters of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan and more than 20 branch offices of the General Association in Tokyo were crowded with Korean residents from all over Tokyo, who expressed their joy at the unconditional extension of the agreement on repatriating Korean residents.

At 6:00 p.m. today, shortly after the agreement to extend the agreement was signed, more than 300 Korean residents gathered in front of the General Association to hold a rally. A huge banner hung on the fifth floor of the building, reading "Congratulations on the extension of the agreement. Thank you to the Japanese people for their support."

    来往信件说，双方已经同意11月10日在新潟举行会议，讨论增加遣送朝鲜侨民的运输能力。
    金珠荣在记者招待会上说，我们看到为旅日朝鲜侨民返回金日成首相所领导的祖国开辟了宽阔的道路，感到非常高兴。
    他说，朝鲜红十字会代表团对日本人民表示感谢，因为他们把遣送朝侨问题当作自己的问题，并且在实现延长协定方面同朝鲜侨民进行合作。
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：旅日朝鲜人总联合会总部和总联合会在东京的二十多个分部办事处前面挤满了来自东京各处的朝鲜侨民，他们对遣送朝侨协定无条件延长表示高兴。
    今天傍晚六点钟，在延长这个协定的协议签字后不久，便有三百多名朝鲜侨民聚集在总联合会面前举行大会。在大楼的五层楼上挂着巨幅标语，上面写着“祝贺协定的延长。多谢日本人民对我们的支持。”
