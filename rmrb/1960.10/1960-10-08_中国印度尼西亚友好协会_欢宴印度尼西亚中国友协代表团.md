Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: The Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the delegation of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association headed by Suripto.

Sirajudin Abbas, one of the chairmen of the Indonesian Peace Committee and a member of the Cooperation Parliament, and his wife were invited to attend the banquet.

Burhan, President of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, spoke at the banquet. He first expressed a warm welcome to the Indonesian friends.

Burhan said that China and Indonesia are two friendly countries. The friendship between our two peoples is based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference. We know that the Indonesian people have been safeguarding national independence, defending peace, opposing imperialist aggression and interference, and persisting in the struggle to recover their territory of West Irian. The Chinese people have consistently supported this just struggle of the Indonesian people. Similarly, the Chinese people's struggle to recover Taiwan, our territory that is still occupied by U.S. imperialism, has also received the sympathy and support of the Indonesian people.

Burhan emphasized that only when the people of Asia, the people of Africa, the people of Latin America, and all peace-loving people of the world unite and form a broad united front to wage a resolute and unremitting struggle against the aggressive forces headed by U.S. imperialism can it be possible to stop imperialism from launching wars of aggression and to safeguard national independence and defend world peace. However, imperialism is not reconciled to failure, and it will do everything possible to provoke and undermine the unity between the people of all countries and between all nations. Our two peoples should be more vigilant, cherish the deep friendship between our two peoples, and consolidate and develop it day by day.

Suripto, head of the Indonesian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation, enthusiastically praised our country's achievements in various fields in his speech. He said, "We have personally witnessed the amazing development your country has made in the economic, cultural and social fields. What attracts us most is the people's commune, which shines like a beautiful gem."

Suripto said, "I believe that through this visit to China by the delegation of the Indonesian-Chinese Friendship Association, we will further realize the task stipulated in Article 2 of our association's charter, namely, 'The purpose of the association is to promote mutual understanding and further enhance friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese peoples through extensive cultural ties.'"

Finally, Suripto expressed his gratitude to the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries for its warm reception. Those present at the banquet included Hu Yuzhi, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and members of the Council, Wang Mingyuan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and Da Pongsheng, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association.

Gipto, First Secretary of the Indonesian Embassy in China, was also invited to attend the banquet.

    中国印度尼西亚友好协会
    欢宴印度尼西亚中国友协代表团
    据新华社7日讯　中国印度尼西亚友好协会今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎以苏里普托为首的印度尼西亚中国友好协会代表团。
    印度尼西亚和平委员会主席之一、合作议会议员西拉朱丁·阿巴斯和他的夫人应邀出席了宴会。
    中国印度尼西亚友好协会会长包尔汉在宴会上讲话。他首先向印度尼西亚的朋友们表示热烈欢迎。
    包尔汉说，中国和印度尼西亚是两个友好的国家。我们两国人民之间的友谊是建立在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神的基础上的。我们知道印度尼西亚人民一直在维护民族独立、保卫和平、反对帝国主义的侵略和干涉，坚持为收复自己的领土西伊里安而斗争，中国人民一贯地支持印度尼西亚人民的这个正义的斗争。同样，中国人民为收复目前还被美帝国主义霸占着的我国的领土台湾而进行的斗争，也是深得印度尼西亚人民的同情和支持。
    包尔汉着重指出，唯有亚洲人民、非洲人民、拉丁美洲人民以及全世界各国爱好和平的人民团结起来，结成广泛的统一战线，向以美帝为首的侵略势力进行坚决不懈的斗争，才有可能制止帝国主义发动侵略战争，才有可能维护民族独立、保卫世界和平。但是，帝国主义是不甘心失败的，它还要千方百计挑拨和破坏各国人民之间、各民族之间的团结。我们两国人民更应提高警惕，珍惜我们两国人民之间的深厚友谊，并使其日益巩固和发展。
    印度尼西亚中国友好协会代表团团长苏里普托在讲话中热情地赞扬我国在各方面所取得的成就。他说，我们亲眼看到了贵国在经济、文化和社会方面所取得的惊人发展。最吸引我们的是，犹如美丽的宝石那样闪闪发光的人民公社。
    苏里普托说，我相信，通过印尼中国友好协会代表团这次访问中国，将进一步实现我们友协章程第二条所规定的任务，即“友协的宗旨是通过广泛的文化联系来促进印度尼西亚人民与中国人民之间的相互了解及进一步增进友谊”。
    最后，苏里普托对中国印度尼西亚友好协会的盛情接待表示感谢。出席宴会的有：中国印度尼西亚友好协会副会长胡愈之和理事，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副秘书长王明远，中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生等。
    印度尼西亚驻中国大使馆一等秘书吉普多也应邀出席了宴会。
