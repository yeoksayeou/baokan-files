Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: Light industry workers across the country are launching a mass movement for increasing production and thrift in raw materials, in coordination with the autumn harvest, making every effort to open up sources of raw materials.

About 70% of the raw materials used by China's light industry come from rural areas, and most of them are harvested in autumn or winter. At present, food factories, wineries, cigarette factories, and sugar factories in various places are sending a large number of employees to rural areas during the autumn harvest and "small autumn harvest" season to cooperate with commercial departments in doing a good job in the purchase, transfer, storage, and processing of agricultural and sideline products and wild raw materials that are prone to spoilage, such as sugar beets, sorghum, and tobacco leaves. They also help people's communes strengthen field management, fertilization, and harvesting of autumn and early winter crops such as sugarcane and cotton, in order to increase the yield per unit area of these crops. Workers from the Yimianpo Winery in Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang Province, cooperated closely with commercial departments to help communes rush to collect wild grapes and hops, and set up points in mountainous areas such as Lianghe and Qingyang, collecting, purchasing, and transporting simultaneously, to promptly transport raw materials down the mountain and into the factory. Currently, more than 60,000 kilograms of wild grapes have entered the factory. In Hubei Province, a large number of employees, led by responsible cadres, went to the countryside in three groups. One group went to sugar-producing areas to help transport the raw materials needed by large sugar factories, and at the same time helped communes repair the processing equipment of small sugar factories; one group went to flue-cured tobacco-producing areas to help people's communes build flue-curing rooms and processing equipment for the initial curing of tobacco leaves, and cooperated with commercial departments to purchase commercial flue-cured tobacco; one group went to reed-producing areas to jointly measure reed-producing areas with relevant departments, arrange processing equipment, labor, etc. Tobacco factories in Henan and Gansu also have a group of employees going to rural areas to help do a good job in the collection, purchase, transfer, and preliminary baking of tobacco leaves.

In order to make full use of agricultural raw materials such as milk, goat milk, eggs, fruits, vegetables, rice straw, and wheat straw that are scattered in rural areas and inconvenient to transport, light industry systems in various provinces are cooperating with people's communes to build small sugar factories, small wineries, small paper mills, small pulp mills, and small dairy processing plants that are quick to get started and require little investment, in order to process them locally and avoid damage to raw materials. Nearly two thousand small paper mills and more than ten thousand small pulp mills have been established nationwide. The hundreds of small dairy factories and mobile processing factories set up in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have produced more than 3,000 tons of milk powder. Henan Province, which previously had no sugar industry, has recently established a number of small sugar factories in order to fully utilize the newly harvested fresh sorghum stalks for sugar extraction.

While focusing on household agricultural and sideline products, wineries, paper mills, oil factories, alcohol factories, etc. in various places are also collecting a large number of usable wild raw materials in coordination with the "small autumn harvest." Currently, wineries, alcohol factories, and paper mills in various places have begun to use wild plants for production. In particular, wineries and alcohol factories have saved a lot of grain for the country by using wild plants with high starch content, such as acorns, kudzu root, *Smilax glabra*, and *Lycoris radiata*, to brew wine. In Kaifeng Prefecture, Henan Province, 300 wineries basically do not use grain to brew wine. Because wineries in various places use wild plants as raw materials, the cost of wineries has been greatly reduced, and wineries that have done a good job in comprehensive utilization have also achieved zero cost for white wine. Some famous large paper mills and most small and medium-sized paper mills across the country are collecting and utilizing some wild fibers to solve part of the raw material problem. For example, Jinzhou No. 2 Paper Mill in Liaoning Province can not only meet the production needs of the fourth quarter but also prepare for production in the first quarter of next year by purchasing wild fibers and waste paper.

    趁秋收和“小秋收”季节开展群众性增产节约运动
    轻工业职工广辟原料来源
    下乡上山配合商业部门做好收购调运，帮助公社大搞加工和综合利用
    据新华社28日讯　全国轻工业系统职工配合秋收，正在开展一个群众性的原材料增产节约运动，千方百计开辟原料来源。
    我国轻工业所用的原料，大约有70％来自农村，而且大部分在秋季或冬季收获。目前各地食品工厂、酒厂、烟厂、糖厂派出大批职工趁秋收和“小秋收”季节，到农村配合商业部门搞好甜菜、多穗高粱、烟叶等容易腐烂变质的农副产品和野生原料的收购、调运、保管和加工工作，或者帮助人民公社加强甘蔗、棉花等秋末冬初收割植物的田间管理、施肥、采摘方面的技术指导，以便提高这些作物的单位面积产量。黑龙江省尚志县一面坡葡萄酒厂职工和商业部门密切协作，帮助公社突击采集山葡萄和酒花，同时在亮河、庆阳等山区设点，边采集，边收购，边运输，将原料及时运下山，送进厂，目前进厂的山葡萄已有六万多公斤。湖北省大批职工由负责干部带头分三路下乡。一路前往糖料产区帮助调运大糖厂所需要的原料，同时帮助公社检修小糖厂的加工设备；一路到烤烟产区，帮助人民公社建设烟叶初烤的烤房和加工设备，并且配合商业部门收购商品烤烟；一路到芦苇产地，与有关部门共同测量芦苇产地，安排加工设备、劳动力等。河南、甘肃的烟厂也有一批职工到农村去帮助搞好烟叶的采集、收购、调运及初步烘烤工作。
    为了充分利用农村分散而又不便运输的牛奶、羊奶、鸡蛋、水果、蔬菜、稻草、麦秸等农业原料，各省轻工业系统正与人民公社合作兴建一些土法生产的上马快而投资少的小糖厂、小酒厂、小纸厂、小纸浆和小乳品加工厂，以便就地加工，避免原料遭受损失。全国已兴办的小纸厂近两千个，小纸浆厂约一万多个。内蒙古自治区办起的几百个小乳品厂和流动加工厂，生产了三千多吨乳粉。过去没有制糖工业的河南省，为了充分利用新收获的新鲜多穗高粱秆榨糖，最近也办起一批小型糖厂。
    各地酒厂、纸厂、油厂、酒精厂等，大抓家生的农副产品的同时，正在配合“小秋收”，大量收集各种可以利用的野生原料。现在各地酒厂、酒精厂、纸厂都开始利用野生植物进行生产。特别是酒厂和酒精厂由于采用含淀粉较多的橡子、葛根、金刚头、石蒜等野生植物酿酒，为国家节约了大量粮食。河南开封专区现在有三百个酒厂基本不用粮食酿酒。各地酒厂因为采用野生植物作原料，酒厂的成本大大降低，综合利用搞得好的酒厂，还实现了白酒无成本。全国一些有名的大造纸厂和大多数中小型的造纸厂都在收集和利用一些野生纤维，而解决了一部分原料问题。如辽宁省锦州造纸二厂由于收购野生纤维和废纸，不仅可以满足第四季度生产需要，并且为明年一季度生产做了准备。
