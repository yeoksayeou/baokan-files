To more effectively utilize manpower, equipment, time, space, and technological innovation achievements, concentrated operations were implemented in mining and tunneling at the Dali Zi Iron Mine.

Changchun, October 10th (Our Newspaper) – The Tonghua Dali Zi Iron Mine in Jilin Province has implemented concentrated operations for mining and tunneling, which more effectively utilizes manpower, equipment, time, space, and technological innovation achievements. The entire mine has experienced a continuous leap forward with high output, rapid tunneling, high efficiency, low costs, and good safety. Since May of this year, when the entire mine concentrated equipment and manpower, previously scattered across twenty-seven mining areas, into twenty-two mining areas, the daily ore output from May to September increased by 39.9% compared to January to April. Output per unit area increased from 5.5 tons to 18 tons; the tunneling speed per team increased from 50 meters per month to 65.4 meters; labor productivity increased by 31.6%; the cost per ton of ore decreased by 26.7%; and safety in production was further guaranteed. Due to the accelerated tunneling speed, the total recoverable ore reserves of the entire mine have increased dramatically from thirteen months to twenty-three months, exceeding the state's requirements. This not only ensured the completion and overfulfillment of the state plan every month for the first nine months of this year but also prepared sufficient "grain" for continued leaps forward next year.

The Dali Zi Iron Mine is one of the main mines of Anshan Iron and Steel. To fully meet Anshan Iron and Steel's needs for increased production, the mine's Party Committee summarized past experiences in leading production and decided to appropriately reduce the number of mining areas and working faces, concentrating the majority of manpower and equipment on key mining areas and working faces to achieve high-speed mining and rapid tunneling.

Several months of practice have proven that concentrated operations have great advantages over decentralized operations. With an appropriate reduction in the number of mining areas and working faces, equipment can be used in a concentrated manner, making it easier to manage, maintain, and service, ensuring that everything is used to its fullest potential. The Eastern Workshop concentrated thirty-four rock drills, previously scattered across fifty tunneling faces in eight mining areas, to thirty tunneling faces in four mining areas. The daily output more than doubled compared to the past, and six drills were extracted for maintenance as backup machines. Due to the concentration of equipment, each workshop was able to reasonably arrange usage based on its characteristics, and the equipment utilization rate of the entire mine quickly increased from 60% in April to over 90%.

After implementing concentrated operations, workers are more concentrated in production, making it clear who has high production efficiency and who has low production efficiency. This facilitates the organization of learning, comparing, catching up with, and assisting among workers, timely exchanges of advanced experiences, and rapid improvement of workers' technical skills. In the competition of learning, comparing, catching up with, and assisting, all seven high-speed mining teams and eight rapid tunneling teams in the mine completed their mining and tunneling tasks ahead of schedule.

The implementation of concentrated operations makes it easier for leading cadres to concentrate their efforts on going deep into the front lines of production, enabling them to solve problems in production more directly and effectively. Currently, two Party Committee members from the mine's Party Committee are responsible for one workshop each, and leading cadres from the workshop are responsible for one team each. Instead of running all over the mountains and fields as in the past, they now work underground and hold meetings at the working faces, resolving problems more promptly. After the Northern Workshop implemented concentrated operations, leading cadres, along with technicians, went deep into the tunneling teams to work with the workers, helping them implement shallow drilling with multiple cycles, increasing blasting efficiency. The advance per shift increased from one meter to 1.6 meters. In addition, they mobilized workers to create pneumatic rock loading machines, replaced the wooden bottom plates of the cars with iron bottom plates, increased the unloading sliding force, and reduced the loading and unloading time, which doubled the transportation efficiency and adapted to the needs of high-speed mining.

After the implementation of concentrated operations, various departments were also able to extract more management personnel to regularly participate in labor underground, promptly identify problems, and solve problems. Department personnel have quickly helped workers develop "four fixings" (fixed personnel, fixed machines, fixed efficiency, fixed output) and other systems, promoted synchronous cycle charts, and ensured that the operations of each shift are interconnected, rationally divided, and promoted the rapid improvement of the production level.

    更有效地利用人力、设备、时间、空间和技术革新成果
    大栗子铁矿采矿掘进实行集中作业
    本报长春10日电　吉林省通化大栗子铁矿采矿、掘进实行集中作业，更有效地利用人力、设备、时间、空间和技术革新成果，全矿出现了产量大、掘进快、效率高、成本低、安全好的不断跃进局面。从今年5月全矿把分散在二十七个采区的设备、人力集中到二十二个采区上使用以后，5至9月的矿石日产量，比1至4月份增长了39.9％，单位面积产量由五点五吨提高到十八吨；掘进速度每队由月进五十米提高到六十五点四米；劳动生产率提高31.6％；每吨矿石成本降低了26.7％；并且进一步保证了安全生产。由于掘进速度加快，全矿储备的回采矿量已由十三个月猛增到二十三个月，超过了国家要求。这样，不仅保证了今年前九个月月月完成和超额完成国家计划，还为明年继续跃进准备了充足的“粮食”。
    大栗子铁矿是鞍钢的主要矿山之一。为了充分满足鞍钢增产的需要，矿党委总结了过去领导生产的经验，决定适当少开一些采区和掌子面，把大部分人力、设备集中到重点采区和掌子面上使用，以便实现高速采矿，快速掘进。
    几个月的实践证明：集中作业比分散作业具有很大优越性。矿区和掌子面适当减少以后，设备集中使用，更便于管理、维修和保养，做到物尽其用。东部车间把分散在八个采区五十个掘进掌子上的三十四台凿岩机集中到四个采区三十个掘进掌子上使用，日产量比过去提高了一倍多，并且抽出了六台进行保养，作为备用机。由于设备集中，各车间都能根据特点合理安排使用，全矿设备利用率很快由4月份的60％提高到90％以上。
    实行集中作业以后，工人更加集中在一起生产，谁的生产效率高，谁的生产效率低，互相之间看得很清楚，因此更便于在工人中组织学、比、赶、帮，及时交流先进经验，迅速提高工人技术水平。在学、比、赶、帮的竞赛中，全矿七个高速采矿队和八个快速掘进队都提前完成了采掘任务。
    实行集中作业更便于领导干部集中精力深入生产第一线，能够更直接更有效地解决生产中的问题。现在，矿党委两个党委委员包一个车间，车间领导干部一人包一个队，由过去漫山遍野地跑改为井下办公，掌子头开会，解决问题更加及时。北部车间实行集中作业以后，领导干部带着技术人员深入掘进队和工人一起劳动，帮助工人实行浅打眼多循环，提高了爆破效率，过去每班只进一米，现在提高到一点六米。另外，他们还发动工人创造了气动装岩机，将车的木底板改为铁底板，增加了卸车滑力，压缩了装卸车时间，使运搬效率提高了一倍半，适应了高速采矿的需要。
    实行集中作业以后，各科室也能抽出更多的管理人员经常到井下参加劳动，及时发现问题，解决问题。科室人员已经帮助工人很快制订出“四定”（定人、定机台、定效率、定产量）等制度，推行了同期循环图表等，使各班作业都能做到相互衔接，合理分工，促进了生产水平的迅速提高。
