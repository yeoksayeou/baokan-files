Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 7th. The Iraqi "Independent" newspaper published an editorial today on the recently released Joint Communiqué between the Chinese and Algerian governments, saying that this communiqué is another example demonstrating the noble and glorious stance of the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries towards the Arab liberation cause. The newspaper said that the communiqué wisely clarifies the international situation in favor of the people of all countries still under imperialist control. The communiqué points out that imperialism is still pursuing policies of aggression and war, which will cause the people of all countries to cooperate more and more in order to eliminate the common enemy, imperialism, from every inch of land on the earth.

The newspaper also said that the spirit of the Bandung Conference and the Accra Conference, which is genuinely reflected in the communiqué, will pave the way for creating conditions for the realization of peaceful coexistence and the strengthening of solidarity between Asian and African countries. The newspaper emphasized that the communiqué adds new strength to the justice of the Algerian cause, thereby accelerating the defeat of French imperialism, which is supported by the weapons of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and world imperialism.

The newspaper concluded by saying that the friendship between the Chinese people and the Algerian people and the people of other Arab countries has, in fact, been strengthened through the joint struggle against imperialism.

The "National" newspaper published an editorial today saying that the Joint Communiqué between China and Algeria proves the inevitability of the Algerian people's victory; victory awaits the Algerian people who are struggling for freedom and independence. The newspaper pointed out that one of the most important contents of the communiqué is the reaffirmation of the continued cooperation and mutual support between the two peoples and governments. The Chinese government announced that it will continue to support the Algerian people in their struggle against tyrannical French imperialism until the Algerian people achieve victory in this struggle. The Algerian government announced its support for the struggle of the People's China to safeguard world peace and liberate Taiwan, which is now under the enslavement of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek puppet clique.
