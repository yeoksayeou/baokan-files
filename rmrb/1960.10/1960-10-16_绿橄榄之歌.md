    Song of the Green Olive [Note 1]
    Peru Arturo Corcuera
I want to write a song of the green olive, blending the kindness of the dove with the strength of steel. Today I will not write of the murmuring sea, nor of the autumn wind sweeping fallen leaves; I want to sing of the heroism of the guerrillas.

I came to glorious Havana, where the flames of revolution surged. I saw Fidel with the big beard, [Note 2] who saved the fragrance of the rose and gave the rose to the peasants. Look at his passionate and dignified face, radiating the glory of hard-fought struggles. With one heart and one mind, we move forward hand in hand, wearing olive green uniforms, celebrating with the jubilant militia.

I want to talk about poverty-stricken Peru, which endures hunger and suffering: the Americans are drinking its blood and榨取 its wealth, filling me with anger. For the suffering of my compatriots, for true freedom and democracy, I will climb the Sierra Maestra [Note 3] to collect the seeds of revolution and sow them in my motherland.

Peru sees the dawn of Cuba, sees it illuminating the banner of sovereignty, sees it awakening the broad masses. Its light makes me write this poem, its light will ignite a prairie fire.

            Translated by Wang Zhongnian
        [Note 1] The green olive is the symbol of the Cuban Revolutionary Army. This poem was originally published in the Cuban newspaper *Hoy* on July 31, 1960.
        [Note 2] That is, Fidel Castro, Premier of the Cuban Revolutionary Government.
        [Note 3] Located in Oriente Province in southeastern Cuba, it was the base of guerrilla activities during the anti-Batista dictatorship.

    绿橄榄之歌〔注一〕
    秘鲁　阿尔都罗·考尔古艾拉我要写一首绿橄榄之歌，揉合着鸽子的善良与钢铁的坚
  强，今天且不写喃喃低语的海洋，也不写漫卷落叶的秋风，我要歌唱游击队的英勇。我来到光辉的哈瓦那，革命的火焰汹涌澎湃，我看到大胡子的菲德尔，〔注二〕他拯救了玫瑰的芬芳，又把玫瑰交给了农民。看他热情威严的面庞，散发着饱经斗争的荣光，万众一心，携手前进，穿着橄榄绿的制服，和欢腾的民兵一起庆祝。我要谈破碎贫困的秘鲁，它忍受着饥饿与痛苦：美国佬在喝它的鲜血，又榨取它的财富，使我满腔愤怒。为了我同胞的苦楚，为了真正的自由民主，我要登上马埃斯特腊山，〔注三〕采集革命的种子，播种在我的祖国。秘鲁看到古巴的曙光，看到它照亮了主权的旗帜，看到它唤醒了广大的群众，它的光芒使我写下这首诗歌，它的光芒将燃起燎原之火。
            王仲年译〔注一〕绿橄榄是古巴革命军的标
