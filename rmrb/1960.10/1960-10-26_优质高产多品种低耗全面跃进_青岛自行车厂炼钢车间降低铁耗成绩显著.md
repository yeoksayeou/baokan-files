High Quality, High Yield, Multiple Varieties, Low Consumption, Comprehensive Leap Forward
Qingdao Bicycle Factory's Steelmaking Workshop Achieves Remarkable Results in Reducing Iron Consumption

Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, October 25th: The Qingdao Bicycle Factory's steelmaking workshop, with everyone concerned about increasing production and paying attention to conservation, has not only established a banner in high yield, high quality, and multiple varieties in the past two years but has also made outstanding achievements in reducing pig iron consumption. Since the beginning of this year, they have used iron with a high sulfur content to produce various high-quality steels such as spring steel and low-alloy steel. The average pig iron consumption per ton of steel is 1053 kilograms (excluding 216 kilograms of scrap steel); particularly since the launch of the "Ten, Hundred, Thousand" (ten days of cupola furnace lifespan, one hundred heats of converter lifespan, one thousand kilograms of iron to produce one ton of steel) competition in June, pig iron consumption has further decreased to 986.2 kilograms (excluding 249 kilograms of scrap steel).

In the work of reducing pig iron consumption, the workers set up checkpoints at every stage, with everyone taking responsibility, establishing strict management and technical systems to ensure that not a single bit of material is wasted. At the same time, they prominently focused on the addition of scrap steel, reducing the iron ratio and production costs. In addition, the workers in this workshop also carried out innovations in many aspects, focusing on the key to production. Cupola furnace workers pay attention to accurate weighing of raw materials, uniform distribution of materials, adopt a graded charging method, and have also transformed the furnace shape and the angle of the tuyeres, ensuring strong wind, high temperature, and extended furnace life, which greatly reduces the pig iron loss rate and significantly improves the quality of the steel.

    优质高产多品种低耗全面跃进
    青岛自行车厂炼钢车间降低铁耗成绩显著
    据新华社青岛25日电　青岛自行车厂炼钢车间人人关心增产，个个注意节约，两年来不仅在高产、优质、多品种方面树立了一面旗帜，而且在降低生铁消耗量方面也做出了优异的成绩。今年以来，他们用含硫较高的铁炼出了弹簧钢、低合金钢等多种优质钢，平均每吨钢的生铁消耗量为一千零五十三公斤（加废钢二百一十六公斤不计在内）；特别是从6月份开展“十、百、千”（化铁炉炉龄十天，转炉炉龄一百次，一千公斤铁炼一吨钢）的竞赛运动以来，生铁消耗量更降低到九百八十六点二公斤（加废钢二百四十九公斤不计在内）。
    在降低生铁消耗量的工作中，职工们关关设卡，人人负责，建立严密的管理和技术制度，以保证不浪费一点材料；同时，他们突出地抓了加废钢这一环节，降低了铁比和生产成本。另外，这个车间的职工还围绕生产关键，在许多环节上进行了革新。化铁炉工人注意原料过磅准确，布料均匀，采用分级入炉的办法，并且改造了炉型和风眼角度，保证大风、高温、延长炉龄，使生铁损耗率大大减低，钢的质量显著提高。
