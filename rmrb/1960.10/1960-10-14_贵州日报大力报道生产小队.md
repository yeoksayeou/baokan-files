    *Guizhou Daily* Vigorously Reports on Production Teams
    In recent months, *Guizhou Daily* has strengthened its promotion of production teams in all aspects. This is an important aspect of *Guizhou Daily's* propaganda with agriculture as its foundation, and it is also a new atmosphere in the newspaper's reporting work.
    In August and September, the number of reports in *Guizhou Daily* regarding production teams increased significantly. The reporting forms are also more diverse, including editorials, news, articles and investigation reports, and a special "Production Team Leader Forum" column was also opened. In this way, the activities of the production team are very prominent and active in the newspaper, leaving a deep impression on readers.
    Grasping the grassroots level is a very important issue in leadership work; it is also an important issue in news reporting. The production team is the most basic organization of the People's Commune, and the most direct and specific organizer of agricultural production and members' lives. Therefore, in deeply implementing the thought of "taking agriculture as the foundation" and vigorously developing agriculture and food production, *Guizhou Daily* clearly runs through a guiding ideology: that is, to keep the teams in mind and focus on reporting on production teams. Facts have proved that only by deeply grasping the specific problems of the team, reflecting the team's activities and experiences in organizing and leading production, and enriching and improving the leadership level of the team through reporting, can the newspaper effectively guide the current production practice.
    The production team is the front line of agricultural production, and the production team leader is the commander of the front line. Whether the production team can give full play to its combat role depends to a large extent on the commander's ability to command. A prominent feature of *Guizhou Daily's* reporting on production teams is its concern for production team leaders and its practical help in improving their leadership skills. *Guizhou Daily* opened the "Production Team Leader Forum" column, using the method of production team leaders speaking from their own experience to embody the spirit of "learning while doing, doing while learning" pointed out by Chairman Mao. And through the personal feelings of the team leaders, concretely and vividly exchange leadership experience, and study and solve the practical problems existing in the production team. From August 4th to September 23rd, this column successively published articles by fourteen team leaders. These articles have small titles and solve specific problems; they are short and concise, generally not exceeding one thousand words; the content and language are relatively rich, the examples are vivid; the experience is profound and the feelings are simple; the reasoning is easy to understand, people who are newly literate can understand it, and people who are illiterate can understand it. In the articles, some explain the importance of the team leader taking the mass line and how to take the mass line; some explain that the team leader is a role model for the masses and must strictly demand himself and listen to the Party everywhere; some write about being good at analyzing the characteristics of his own team to grasp the key to increasing production, and the more busy he is, the more he must care about the lives of the masses, and the team leader must be good at using troops, and so on, a series of fundamental issues in the work of the team leader. Because these are all problems that the team leaders urgently need to understand and solve, this column has been generally welcomed by the broad masses of cadres and people, especially the production team leaders, and many production team leaders have enthusiastically contributed articles to introduce their experiences.
    While doing a good job in the "Production Team Leader Forum," *Guizhou Daily* also reflects the concern, help and improvement of the team leader from two aspects. The first is to set up pacesetters and plant red flags, and improve the leadership level of the team leader through learning, comparing, and catching up with each other. The second is to highlight the typical reports of leaders at all levels who go deep into the team to specifically help the team leader summarize experience, or publish articles by these leading comrades. Through these propagandas, the readers are told that the commanders of the front line of production are conscientiously leading everyone to continue to leap forward.
    In order to do a good job in the report of the production team, reporters must go deep into the actual struggle, go to the front line of production, and improve the reporting style and reporting methods. To this end, the *Guizhou Daily* editorial board has made a system that reporters must go to the team, their hearts must be in the team, and they must live in the team. When the reports on the team increased substantially, they also concentrated their efforts to grasp a batch of investigations and introductions of typical experiences, in order to increase the weight of propaganda, make the reports more in-depth, systematic, and more timely to guide actual work. For example, on the eve of the start of the autumn harvest in the province, it highlighted the experience of pioneering the preparation work for the three autumn harvests of the production team; when the autumn harvest was fully launched, it focused on the issue of the rational use of labor, and continuously published the investigation reports of "The Lime Kiln Team is Skilled in Using Troops" and "The Five-Fork Production Team Organizes Autumn Harvest Combat Experience" in a prominent position on the front page, and published "The Qian'guang Team Rationally Uses Labor and Scientifically Organizes Production" and "The Ten-Li Production Team Has Three Sets of Live Roads and One Set of Personnel in the Three Autumn Production" on the second page. Then, some teams successively published some experiences and investigations on managing and using cattle well, accumulating fertilizer, mobilizing the masses to implement the autumn planting area, solving the connection of autumn planting crops, and managing collective grain, and so on. These reports played a role in promoting and guiding the production movement.

### 贵州日报大力报道生产小队

    贵州日报大力报道生产小队
    最近几个月来，贵州日报从各方面加强了对生产小队的宣传。这是贵州日报以农业为基础的宣传中一个重要的方面，也是这个报纸在报道工作中的新气象。
    8、9月份贵州日报有关生产小队的报道，数量有显著的增加。在报道形式上也比较多样，有社论，有消息，也有文章和调查报告，还专门开辟了“生产队长论坛”专栏。这样，生产小队的活动，就在报纸上显得很突出很活跃，给读者留下深刻的印象。
    抓基层，是领导工作中的一个很重要的问题；同样也是新闻报道工作中的重要问题。生产小队是人民公社最基层的组织，是农业生产和社员生活最直接、最具体的组织者。因此，在深入贯彻“以农业为基础”的思想，大办农业、大办粮食的时候，贵州日报鲜明地贯穿着一个指导思想，这就是：要目中有队，大抓生产小队的报道。事实证明，只有深刻地抓住小队的具体问题，反映小队在组织领导生产中的活动和经验，通过报道来丰富、提高小队领导水平，报纸才能有力地指导当前的生产实际。
    生产小队是农业生产的第一线，生产小队长就是第一线的指挥官。生产小队能否充分发挥战斗作用，在很大程度上取决于小队长的指挥能力。贵州日报在小队报道上的一个突出特点，就是关心小队长，切实帮助小队长提高领导水平。贵州日报开辟了“生产队长论坛”专栏，以生产小队长现身说法的方法，来体现毛主席指出的“干中学、学中干”的精神。并且通过小队长的亲身感受，具体生动地交流领导经验，研究和解决生产小队存在的实际问题。从8月4日到9月23日，这个栏里陆续发表了十四位小队长的文章。这些文章的题目小，解决的问题具体；短小精悍，一般不出一千字；内容和语言比较丰富，事例生动；体会深切，感情朴实；说理通俗，初识字的人看得懂，不识字的人听得懂。文章中，有的说明小队长走好群众路线的重要性和怎样走群众路线的问题；有的说明小队长是群众的榜样，一定要严格要求自己，处处听党的话；有的写了要善于分析自己小队的特点抓准增产关键、越忙越要关心群众生活、队长要善于用兵等等小队长工作中一系列带根本性的问题。由于这些都是小队长迫切需要了解和解决的问题，这一栏受到了广大干部群众、特别是生产小队长的普遍欢迎，许多生产小队长还踊跃投稿介绍自己的体会。
    贵州日报在抓好“生产队长论坛”的同时，又从两方面来反映关心、帮助和提高小队长的问题。一是树标兵、插红旗，通过学、比、赶竞赛，互相学习，互相促进，来提高小队长的领导水平；二是突出报道各级领导深入小队具体帮助小队长总结经验的典型，或发表这些领导同志的文章。通过这些宣传，告诉了读者：生产第一线的指挥官，正在兢兢业业地带领着大家不断跃进。
    为了作好生产小队的报道，记者必须深入实际斗争，走上生产前线，改进报道作风和报道方法。贵州日报编委会为此作出了记者要人到小队、心在小队、住宿在小队的制度。在小队报道大量增加的时候，并集中力量抓了一批调查和典型经验介绍，以加重宣传的份量，使报道更能深入、系统，更及时地指导实际工作。比如在全省开始秋收的前夕，突出报道了首创生产队三秋准备工作的经验；在秋收全面展开时，又着重抓住合理使用劳力的问题，并以一版头条的显著地位，连续发表了“石灰窑小队用兵有术”和“五岔生产队组织秋收战斗经验”的调查报告，二版发表了“前光小队合理使用劳力、科学组织生产”和“十里生产队三秋生产中三套活路一套人马”的调查报告。接着，陆续发表了一些小队管好用好耕牛、积肥造肥、发动群众落实秋种面积、解决秋种作物茬口衔接以及管理集体粮食的经验和调查等等。这些报道，对生产运动起了推动和指导的作用。
