Carry Forward the Spirit of the Yan'an Era and Become Successors to the Revolution

Currently, all fronts of socialist construction across the country and the province are showing a vibrant scene of concerted efforts, mutual encouragement, and continued great leaps forward, with all work brimming with vigorous vitality. Under this excellent situation, the Party Central Committee has put forward a new call: to launch a production increase and thrift campaign centered on grain and steel. This is the most central task for the entire Party and all the people at present. The Communist Youth League organizations and the vast number of young people in the province should take swift action under the leadership of the Party, hold high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle from the Yan'an era, and contribute even greater strength to the production increase and thrift campaign centered on grain and steel.

Here, I want to emphasize the spirit of hard struggle from the Yan'an era. This spirit embodies the revolutionary heroism of the proletariat, who are not afraid of hardship or difficulty, and the tenacity and hard work of perseverance. In the past, during the democratic revolution, we adhered to this revolutionary spirit and won the victories of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. Now, in the period of socialist construction, we must carry forward this spirit even more, in order to accelerate the pace of socialist construction and rapidly change our country's "poor and blank" state. Therefore, the spirit of the Yan'an era is our revolutionary "family treasure," and we should inherit it and carry it forward at all times. In a telegram to Yan'an on October 26, 1949, Chairman Mao called on "all revolutionary workers throughout the country to always maintain the spirit of hard struggle that the workers in Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region possessed during the past ten years or more." In particular, young comrades, as successors to the revolution, should inherit this glorious tradition and carry it forward.

Some young comrades do not fully understand the great significance of the Yan'an era spirit. Some of them say, "The Yan'an style is a minor matter of life; what is there to carry forward?" Some say, "Times have changed, and the Yan'an style is outdated." Still others say, "Building socialism is for the pursuit of happiness, not for the pursuit of hardship," and so on. Obviously, these views are incorrect and need to be clarified.

Here, recalling the path our revolution has taken is very meaningful. As everyone knows, during the period when the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao led the Chinese revolution in Yan'an, Japanese imperialism was frantically invading us, attempting to destroy our nation, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the support of U.S. imperialism, mobilized hundreds of thousands of troops to heavily blockade the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, attempting to trap our Party and the army and people of the revolutionary base areas to death. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was originally a barren mountainous area. Under the enemy's encirclement, we encountered extremely serious difficulties in terms of food, clothing, and supplies. For a time, "we were reduced to a state of almost no clothes to wear, no oil to eat, no paper, and no vegetables. The soldiers had no shoes and socks, and the staff had no bedding in winter." (Mao Zedong: Economic and Financial Problems During the War of Resistance Against Japan) However, these difficulties did not frighten us. In 1942, Chairman Mao put forward the call for "self-reliance" and "ample food and clothing" to the Eighth Route Army, which was immediately warmly responded to by the Party, government, army, and people in the border region. In 1943, the entire Party, army, and people launched a large-scale production movement. Whether they were office cadres, school teachers and students, soldiers, or workers and peasants, everyone worked, studied, fought, and engaged in labor production. The vast number of peasants also organized "labor exchange teams," "mutual aid teams," and "Tang Jiang performance groups." The grain, vegetables, meat, and oil they ate, the cotton clothes, wool clothes, shoes, and socks they wore, the cave dwellings and houses they lived in, the large and small auditoriums where meetings were held, the desks, chairs, benches, pens, ink, and paper for daily use, the charcoal and firewood they burned, etc., were almost all produced and manufactured by themselves. At that time, the 359th Brigade of the 120th Division of the Eighth Route Army transformed the desolate Nanniwan into the famous "Jiangnan of Northern Shaanxi." As a result, there was more grain, more pork, and more cattle, sheep, chickens, and ducks. The enemy's blockade was smashed by us, and the people of the border region achieved ample food and clothing.

These facts show that in the most difficult period of the revolution, it was because we adhered to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle that we won the victories of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. It can be seen that the Yan'an style is related to the survival of the revolutionary forces, to whether or not we can defeat Japanese imperialism, and to whether or not we can defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries and achieve the victory of the Chinese revolution. Obviously, this is by no means a minor matter of life.

Of course, our current situation is indeed very different from that of the Party Central Committee in Yan'an. At that time, we only had scattered revolutionary base areas surrounded on all sides by enemies at home and abroad, and most parts of the country were still in the hands of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The liberated areas had no modern industry at all, and agricultural production was also very backward. Now, we have firmly grasped the political power of the whole country, achieved decisive victories in the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, realized the people's communes in the countryside, and a situation of continuous leap forward has emerged in socialist construction. These conditions are vastly different from those in the Yan'an era. However, we are believers in continuous revolution, and hard struggle and striving for strength are closely linked to the spirit of continuous revolution. Although the situation is different and the conditions have changed, the revolution can never stagnate, and the spirit of hard struggle will never be outdated. Moreover, it has only been eleven years since our country was founded, and the "poor and blank" state has not been fundamentally changed. The tasks before us are still very arduous. As Chairman Mao said: "It is necessary to make all young people understand that our country is still a very poor country, and it is impossible to fundamentally change this situation in a short period of time. It all depends on the unity and struggle of young people and all the people for decades to create a prosperous and strong country with their own hands." It should also be seen that U.S. imperialism is still occupying our Taiwan, has established many military bases around our country, and is constantly sending aircraft to invade our country's airspace and territorial waters. Chairman Mao said: "Imperialism is bullying us so much; this needs to be dealt with seriously." How should we deal with it? In the Yan'an era, we relied on hard struggle and self-reliance to defeat Japanese imperialism and the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, who were bullying us at the time. Today, we should carry forward the spirit of the Yan'an era, accelerate our country's socialist construction, and build our country into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible. Facing such an arduous task, how can we say that the Yan'an style is outdated?

The Yan'an era style is the revolutionary style of the proletariat, and adhering to this style is a manifestation of the proletariat's revolutionary steadfastness. The bourgeoisie relies on exploitation for a living. They reach out for clothes and open their mouths for food, living a corrupt life of not working. They will not recognize the Yan'an era style. We are the proletariat, and we have always regarded labor as the first need of life. We must unswervingly adhere to and carry forward the Yan'an era style. Only by adhering to and carrying forward the Yan'an era style can we prevent the erosion of bourgeois ideology and firmly maintain the proletariat's revolutionary stand and revolutionary will, and carry the revolutionary cause of socialism and communism through to the end.

Some young people regard eating well, dressing well, and living well as the greatest happiness. This is obviously incorrect, or at least very narrow. Of course, clothing, food, and housing are necessary living conditions for human beings. No one can deny that human beings cannot survive without these conditions. However, we are proletarian revolutionaries and must never only care about ourselves and disregard others. Our goal is to realize communism throughout the world and enable people all over the world to eat well, dress well, and live well. We regard realizing this goal as the greatest happiness. If we concentrate our energy on pursuing personal material enjoyment, then we are not proletarian revolutionaries but selfish mediocrities.

The era we are in is both an era full of happiness and an era full of suffering. On the one hand, the people of the Soviet Union, our country, and other socialist countries all live in a socialist society without exploitation or oppression, and their material and cultural lives are thriving, which is indeed happiness. However, our socialist construction is only just beginning, our production has not yet fully developed, and our lives are not yet very affluent. Especially now, there are still many countries in the world under imperialist rule, where the people are oppressed and exploited, have no clothes to wear, no food to eat, and suffer greatly. In this situation, how can we only be satisfied with the happiness we have already obtained, and how can we only pursue personal material enjoyment? We are revolutionary youth under the leadership of the Communist Party. We cannot only see the happiness of living in a socialist society but also see the suffering of those class brothers who still live under imperialist rule. We cannot be satisfied with the happy life we have already obtained but must strive hard, work hard, strive for strength, and constantly move forward for the great ideal of realizing communism.

Marx said: "Struggle is happiness." Chairman Mao also said: "It is endless joy to struggle with heaven, endless joy to struggle with earth, and endless joy to struggle with people." Look at how revolutionary teachers understand happiness, how noble their style is. Happiness will not fall from the sky and cannot be obtained without labor; it must be fought for through hard struggle. To struggle with imperialism and all reactionaries, to struggle with nature; only by eliminating imperialism and all reactionaries and overthrowing the rule of capitalism can mankind control nature. This is true happiness. Revolutionary predecessors understood and pursued happiness in this way. In Zichang County, northern Shaanxi, there is a man named Hao Shucai, who was a veteran Red Army soldier who joined the revolution in 1925. He performed many meritorious services on the battlefield and won the title of special-class combat hero many times. In the large-scale production movement in 1943, he created a record of reclaiming 4.3 mu of wasteland in one day. He was known as "The Ox That Dies of Anger" and was rated as a special-class labor model. In 1954, he returned home after demobilization. When the Zichang County magistrate went to help him settle down, he said: "I don't want anything. With a pair of hands, I can have anything." Not only did he not want the help of the local government, but he also handed over the retirement pay he received to the agricultural cooperative. In the past two years, he has served as the general branch secretary of the management area and still works more than 300 labor days every year. These revolutionary predecessors did not pursue personal food and clothing or the warmth of a small family but the interests of the vast majority of the masses.

Young comrades, you are the successors to the revolution, successors to socialism, and successors to communism. To take over the revolutionary mantle, you must have a revolutionary style, and you must have the spirit of hard struggle of the Yan'an era. At present, the reason why we emphasize carrying forward the Yan'an era style is, on the one hand, to require everyone to actively participate in the production increase and thrift campaign centered on grain and steel, and to use the Yan'an era style to vigorously develop agriculture and steel in order to accelerate the speed of our country's socialist construction. On the other hand, it is to ask everyone not to lose the revolutionary style of the Yan'an era but to pass it on from generation to generation. Most young people grew up in a peaceful environment after liberation, have not experienced the severe test of revolutionary war, and do not understand or do not fully understand what the Yan'an era style is like. Therefore, we must vigorously publicize and promote the Yan'an era style, so that everyone can understand the revolutionary spirit of the Yan'an era, inherit and carry it forward, and make the revolutionary style of the Yan'an era a powerful driving force for promoting the continued development of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    发扬延安时代作风，作革命的接班人
    当前，全国、全省社会主义建设的条条战线，都是一片同心协力，你追我赶，继续大跃进的沸腾景象，各项工作都充满着蓬蓬勃勃的朝气。在这种大好形势下，党中央提出了新的号召：开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动。这是全党全民当前最中心的任务。全省共青团组织和广大青年，应该迅速行动起来，在党的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，发扬延安时代艰苦奋斗的革命作风，在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，贡献出更大的力量。
    这里我想着重讲的是发扬延安时代那种艰苦奋斗的作风。这种作风体现了无产阶级战士不畏艰苦、不怕困难的革命英雄主义精神和坚韧不拔、埋头苦干的毅力。过去，我们在民主革命时期，坚持了这种革命作风，赢得了抗日战争和解放战争的胜利；现在，在社会主义建设时期，我们更要发扬这种作风，以加快社会主义建设的步伐，迅速改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌。所以说，延安时代的作风，是我们革命的“传家宝”，在任何时候，都应该继承它，发扬它。1949年10月26日毛主席给延安的一个复电中，就号召“全国一切革命工作人员，永远保持过去十余年间在延安和陕甘宁边区的工作人员中所具有的艰苦奋斗的作风。”特别是青年同志，是革命的接班人，更应该把这种光荣传统继承下来，使它进一步发扬光大。
    有些青年同志，对于延安时代作风的伟大意义认识不足，他们当中有人说：“延安作风是生活小事，有什么值得发扬的呢？”有人说：“时代变了，延安作风已经过时了”；还有些青年人说：“建设社会主义是为了追求幸福，不是为了追求艰苦”，等等。很显然，这些看法都是不正确的，是需要加以澄清的。
    这里，回忆一下我国革命所走过来的道路是非常有意义的。大家知道，党中央和毛主席在延安领导中国革命的那个时期，日本帝国主义疯狂地侵略我们，妄想消灭我们的民族，国民党反动派在美帝国主义的支持下，调集了几十万军队，重重封锁陕甘宁边区，企图把我们党和革命根据地的军民困死。陕甘宁边区原是一个贫瘠的山区，在敌人的围困下，吃的、穿的、用的，遇到了极端严重的困难，有一个时期，“我们曾经弄到几乎没有衣穿，没有油吃，没有纸，没有菜，战士没有鞋袜，工作人员在冬天没有被盖。”（毛泽东：抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题）但是，这些困难并没有吓倒我们。1942年，毛主席向八路军提出了“自己动手”，“丰衣足食”的号召，立即得到了边区党、政、军、民的热烈响应，1943年，全党全军全民开展了大生产运动，不论是机关干部、学校师生、部队官兵以及工农群众，人人动手，一边工作，一边学习，一边打仗，一边劳动生产。广大农民也组织起“变工队”、“扎工队”和“唐将班子”。吃的粮、菜、肉、油，穿的棉衣、毛衣、鞋袜，住的窑洞、房屋，开会的大小礼堂，日用的桌椅、板凳、笔墨、纸张，烧的木炭、柴禾，等等，差不多都是自己生产、自己制造的。当时的八路军一二○师三五九旅，把荒凉的南泥湾变成了有名的“陕北江南”。这样一来，粮食多了，猪肉多了，牛、羊、鸡、鸭多了，敌人的封锁被我们粉碎了，边区人民实现了丰衣足食。
    这些事实说明，在革命最艰苦的时期，由于我们坚持了自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命作风，才取得了抗日战争和解放战争的胜利。可见延安作风，关系到革命力量的存亡问题，关系到能不能打败日本帝国主义的问题，关系到能不能打败国民党反动派取得中国革命胜利的问题。很显然，这绝不是什么生活小事。
    当然，我们现在的情况，同党中央在延安时的情况，确实大大不同了。那时，我们只有处于国内外敌人四面包围下的一片一片分散的革命根据地，全国大多数地方还在国民党反动派手里；解放区根本没有什么现代工业，农业生产也非常落后。现在，我们已经巩固地掌握了全国的政权；在经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上取得了社会主义革命的决定性胜利；在农村实现了人民公社化；社会主义建设出现了持续跃进的局面。这些条件，比之延安时代，不知变了多少。但是，我们是不断革命论者，艰苦奋斗、发愤图强是同不断革命的精神密切相连的；尽管情况不同了，条件改变了，革命永远不能停滞，艰苦奋斗的精神，也永远不会过时。何况我们建国不过十一年，“一穷二白”的面貌尚未根本改变，摆在我们面前的任务还是十分艰巨的。正如毛主席所说：“要使全体青年懂得，我们的国家现在还是一个很穷的国家，并且不可能在短时期内根本改变这种状况，全靠青年和全体人民在几十年内团结奋斗，用自己的双手创造一个富强的国家。”还要看到，美帝国主义还在霸占着我国台湾，在我国周围建立了许多军事基地，并且不断派飞机侵略我国的领空和领海。毛主席说：“帝国主义如此欺侮我们，这是需要认真对付的。”怎样对付呢？在延安时代，我们靠艰苦奋斗、自力更生，打败了当时欺侮我们的日本帝国主义和美帝国主义的走狗国民党反动派。在今天，我们更应该发扬延安时代的作风，加速我国的社会主义建设，尽快地把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国。面对着这样艰巨的任务，怎能说延安作风过时了呢？
    延安时代作风是无产阶级的革命作风，坚持这种作风，是无产阶级革命坚定性的表现。资产阶级是靠剥削为生的，他们衣来伸手，饭来张口，过着不劳而食的腐朽生活，他们是不会承认延安时代作风的。我们是无产阶级，我们从来就把劳动看作生活的第一需要，我们必须毫不动摇地坚持和发扬延安时代作风。只有坚持和发扬延安时代作风，才能防止资产阶级思想的侵蚀，才能坚定不移地保持无产阶级的革命立场和革命意志，把社会主义、共产主义的革命事业进行到底。
    有些青年人把个人吃好、穿好、住好，看作最大的幸福。这显然是不对的，至少是非常狭窄的。当然，衣、食、住是人类必需的生活条件，离开了这些条件，人类就不能生存下去，这是谁都不能否认的。但是，我们是无产阶级革命家，决不能只顾自己，不顾别人。我们的奋斗目标，是在全世界实现共产主义，让全世界人民都能吃好、穿好、住好。我们把实现这个目标看作最大的幸福。如果把自己的精力集中在追求个人的物质享受上面，那就不是一个无产阶级的革命家，而是一个自私自利的庸人了。
    我们所处的时代，既是充满幸福的时代，又是苦难重重的时代。一方面，苏联、我国和其他社会主义国家的人民，都生活在没有剥削、没有压迫的社会主义社会，物质文化生活蒸蒸日上，确实是幸福的。但是，我们建设社会主义还只是开始，我们的生产还没有充分的发展，我们的生活还不是很富裕的。特别是现在，世界上还有许多国家受着帝国主义统治，那里的人民受压迫，受剥削，没有衣穿，没有饭吃，苦难重重。在这种情况下，我们怎能仅仅满足于已经得到的幸福，怎能仅仅追求个人的物质享受呢？我们是共产党领导下的革命青年，我们不能光看到自己生活在社会主义社会里的幸福，还要看到那些仍然生活在帝国主义统治下的阶级兄弟的苦难；不能满足于现在已经得到的幸福生活，要为实现共产主义的远大理想，艰苦奋斗，发愤图强，自强不息，永远向前。
    马克思说过：“斗争就是幸福”。毛主席也说：“与天奋斗，其乐无穷；与地奋斗，其乐无穷；与人奋斗，其乐无穷。”我们看，革命导师们对幸福是怎样理解的，他们的风格多么高尚；幸福，不会从天上掉下来，不能够不劳而获，而要通过艰苦的斗争去争取。同帝国主义和一切反动派作斗争，同大自然作斗争；只有消灭了帝国主义和一切反动派，推翻了资本主义的统治，人类能够控制自然界，这才是真正的幸福。革命前辈们就是这样理解和追求幸福的。陕北的子长县有个郝树才，他是1925年参加革命的老红军战士，在战场上多次立功，多次获得了特等战斗英雄的称号，在1943年的大生产运动中，曾创造了一天开荒地四点三亩的最高纪录，人称“气死牛”，被评为特等劳动模范。1954年，他复员回家了，当子长县县长去帮助他安家的时候，他说：“我什么都不要，有一双手，啥都会有。”他不仅不要当地政府的帮助，而且把领到的退职金交给农业社。近两年来他担任管理区的总支书记，每年还做三百多个劳动日。这些革命前辈们，他们追求的既不是个人的吃穿，也不是小家庭的温暖，而是最大多数群众的利益。
    青年同志们，你们是革命的接班人，接社会主义的班，接共产主义的班。接革命的班，就要有革命的作风，要有延安时代那种艰苦奋斗的作风。当前，我们所以要强调发扬延安时代作风，一方面是要求大家积极地投入以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中去，用延安时代的作风，大办农业，大办钢铁，以加快我国社会主义建设的速度；另一方面，就是要大家不要把延安时代的革命作风丢掉了，而要一代一代地传下去。青年人，大部分是在解放后的和平环境中长大的，没有经过革命战争的严峻考验，不理解或不完全理解延安时代作风到底是个什么样子。因此，我们要大力宣传和提倡延安时代的作风，使大家了解到延安时代作风的革命精神，把它继承和发扬光大，使延安时代的革命作风成为推动我国社会主义革命、社会主义建设继续发展的强大动力。
