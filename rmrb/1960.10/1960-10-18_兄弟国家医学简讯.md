Medical Briefs from Brother Countries

    North Korea Widely Develops Eastern Medicine
    In order to enable oriental medicine to better serve the health of the people, oriental medicine hospitals are being widely established throughout North Korea.
    The newly built Pyongyang City Oriental Medicine Hospital has become an institution for the systematic study of oriental medicine. The hospital has departments of internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology, acupuncture, and a raw drug processing room, as well as a ward with one hundred beds. The hospital has purchased modern medical equipment such as X-ray equipment, microscopes, and chemical analysis instruments in order to better carry out the scientific organization of oriental medicine.
    At present, such hospitals are being established in various provinces. Western hospitals in various places have also generally established departments of Eastern Medicine to strengthen the combination of Eastern and Western medicine.

    Patient Revived After Eighteen Years of Coma
    Soviet doctors, after a long period of careful treatment, finally awakened a patient who had been in a coma for eighteen years, creating a miracle in medical practice.
    The patient, named Peter Vetrov, was formerly a Soviet soldier who lost consciousness due to a severe concussion in a battle near Moscow eighteen years ago. He was sent to the "Dobrynikh" psychiatric hospital near Moscow in December 1942.
    The patient, who has regained his sanity, told the doctors about the circumstances of the concussion at the time, gave the address of his relatives, and sent them letters. Vetrov was twenty-nine years old when he was admitted to the hospital and is forty-seven years old this year. He is now in good health and will soon take up a new job.

    New Method for Treating Hypertension
    The Kiev State Hospital in the Soviet Union has built an artificial climate chamber for the treatment of hypertension. Preliminary results show that some extremely serious hypertension patients can be discharged from the hospital after staying here for a few days without taking medicine or injections.
    This artificial climate chamber is a sealed chamber completely isolated from the outside world. The indoor climate most conducive to the treatment of hypertension is established artificially. The treatment method is to make the patient breathe easily and live in a quiet and regular manner. Patients eat, sleep, and live in the sealed room, and can also read newspapers and listen to the radio. The room is equipped with television equipment and various instruments leading to the next room. The on-duty doctor can observe the patient's condition in the next room, understand the conditions of various climatic factors in the sealed room, and adjust them through various instruments. He can also talk to the patient by telephone.

    One Dog, Two Hearts
    Czechoslovak surgeons recently completed the first operation in the history of Czechoslovak medicine to transplant a second heart into a dog.
    This is an extremely complex and difficult operation, and it is of great significance for studying the transplantation of important organs in animals. This operation is the second in the history of world medicine. The first was completed by Soviet scientists.
    The operation was performed by surgeons at the Brno Surgical Clinical Hospital under the leadership of Bednarzhem. The operation lasted forty-five minutes.

    兄弟国家医学简讯
    朝鲜广泛发展东医
    为了使东方医学能更进一步为人民的健康服务，朝鲜北方各地正在广泛建立东医医院。
    新建的平壤市东医医院已经成为系统研究东方医学的机构。这个医院设有内科、小儿科、妇科、针灸科、生药加工室等科室，并且还有一个拥有一百张病床的住院部。这个医院购置了Ｘ射线设备、显微镜、化学分析仪器等现代化医学设备，以便更好地进行东方医学的科学整理工作。
    目前各道都在陆续设立这样的医院。各地西医院也都普遍建立了东医科，以加强东西医的结合。
    昏迷十八年的病人复苏
    苏联医师们经过长时间悉心治疗，终于使一个昏迷了十八年的病人在最近清醒过来，创造了医学实践中的一个奇迹。
    这位病人名叫彼得·维特罗夫，从前是苏军战士，十八年前在莫斯科附近的一次战斗中因激烈震伤失去了知觉。他在1942年12月被送入了这所设在莫斯科近郊的“多勃雷尼赫”精神病医院。
    这位恢复了理智的病人向医师叙述了当时受震伤的情形，说出了自己亲人的住址，并给他们寄了信。维特罗夫入院时是二十九岁，今年四十七岁。现在身体很健壮，不久即将走上新的工作岗位。
    治疗高血压的新方法
    苏联基辅州立医院建成了一座治疗高血压症用的人工气候室，试用结果，一些极严重的高血压患者在这里住上几天，用不着服药和打针，就可以康复出院。
    这种人工气候室是一种与外界完全隔绝的密封室。室内用人工方法建立了对于治疗高血压最有利的气候。治疗的方法就是使患者呼吸轻松，生活安静而有规律。患者在密封室里吃饭、睡眠、生活，也可以看看书报，听听收音机。室内装有通到邻室去的电视装置和各种仪表。值班医师在邻室可以观察到患者的情况，了解到密封室内各种气候因素的情况并可以通过各种仪表加以调节。他还可以通过电话与患者交谈。
    一狗二心
    捷克斯洛伐克外科专家们前不久完成了捷克斯洛伐克医学史上第一次为狗移植第二个心脏的手术。
    这是一种极为复杂和困难的手术，它对研究动物重要器官的移植具有重要意义。这次手术是世界医学史上的第二次。第一次是由苏联科学家完成的。
    这次手术是布尔诺外科临床医院的外科大夫们在贝德纳尔热姆领导下完成的。手术历时四十五分钟。
