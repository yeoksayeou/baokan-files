    Great Leap Forward and Meticulous Work
    Chen Zhiyan
    Right after the holiday, good news keeps pouring in. The iron and steel front is boiling with a lively and vigorous production surge for the fourth quarter.
    In the first three quarters, our iron and steel production has achieved remarkable results. The steel output from January to August is almost equal to that of the previous eleven months of last year. The fourth quarter is the last quarter, and naturally we should take advantage of the victory and move forward, making a great leap forward. The so-called Great Leap Forward means the great promotion of the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and striving for strength, which is also the true color of the working class. We often say that the working class is a world-transforming force, and it is impossible to transform the world without a great leap forward. Therefore, at any time, we must maintain the revolutionary spirit of the Great Leap Forward to engage in the struggle for production. With this spirit, nothing can stop us.
    However, the Great Leap Forward must be done meticulously. The struggle for production, like any other struggle, will encounter some difficulties. Of course, there is no struggle without difficulties. In the fourth quarter, our Great Leap Forward is to greatly increase the production of iron and steel, which will naturally encounter some difficulties. Therefore, we must also do it meticulously, which means that we must make a specific analysis of the difficulties, and mobilize the masses to take specific measures to overcome them.
    A key point here is meticulousness. For example, to greatly increase production, we must greatly conserve. At present, the supply of coke in many places is not sufficient. There are many ways to solve this problem. In addition to trying every means to increase production, the potential for conservation is also great. The problem is whether your work is meticulous enough. The report published on this page today about the implementation of coal and coke quota management in various iron and steel enterprises in Shijiazhuang mentions that Yuanshi Iron and Steel Plant has taken two specific measures to save coke. One is to replace the large hammer used to crush coke with a small hammer, and the other is to lay bricks on the ground when crushing. These are such ordinary and small measures, but don't underestimate them. It is because of these two meticulous and small measures that the coke loss rate of this iron and steel plant has been reduced from 15% to below 10%. The reduction of loss is equivalent to increasing coke for the production of pig iron. There are many similar methods, but if the work is done roughly and not meticulously, the potential for saving coke may still be potential and will not automatically come out.
    The Great Leap Forward originally includes meticulous work. Because there is no special secret to greatly increasing the production of iron and steel, the main thing is to meticulously solve specific problems in the production process one by one. As problems are solved one by one, production will naturally continue to rise.
    By always maintaining the ambition of the Great Leap Forward and constantly carrying out meticulous and down-to-earth work, our iron and steel production will surely continue to rise significantly again and again.

    大干和细做
    陈之衍
    节日刚过，捷音纷至，钢铁战线上沸腾着一片生龙活虎大干第四季度的增产热潮。
    前三个季度，我们的钢铁生产取得了十分出色的成就，1至8月的钢产量差不多等于去年十一个月的钢产量。第四季度是最后一个季度，自然更要乘胜前进，大干一场。所谓大干，就是艰苦奋斗、发愤图强的革命精神的大发扬，这也是工人阶级的本色。我们常说：工人阶级是翻天复地的人，要翻天复地不大干是不行的。因而，任何时候，我们都要保持着大干的革命精神去从事生产斗争，有了这种精神，就什么也难不倒我们。
    但是，大干必须细做。生产斗争和任何其它斗争一样，都会碰到这样那样的一些困难。没有困难的斗争当然是没有的。第四季度我们要大干也就是要大幅度地增产钢铁，自然也会碰到一些困难。所以还要细做，就是说，要对困难作具体分析，要发动群众采取具体措施去战胜困难。
    这里的一个关键在于细。比如要大增产就要大节约。当前许多地方焦炭的供应不够充裕。解决这个问题，办法很多。除了千方百计增产以外，节约的潜力也大得很，问题在于你的工作是不是做得细。今天本版发表的石家庄各地钢铁企业实行煤、焦定额管理的报道中，提到元氏炼铁厂采取两项节约焦炭的具体措施，一是把粉碎焦炭用的大锤子改成小锤子，一是粉碎时，在地面上铺上砖头。这是多么平凡、细小的措施啊，但切不可轻视它，就是由于采取了这两项又细又小的措施，这个炼铁厂的焦炭损耗率从15％降低到10％以下。损耗减少了，也就等于为增产生铁增加了焦炭。类似的办法还多得很，但如果工作做得粗而不细，节约焦炭的潜力就可能依然是潜力，而并不会自动地跑出来。
    大干本来就包含着细做。因为大幅度增产钢铁，并没有什么特别的妙诀，主要是细致地解决一个个生产过程中的具体问题。问题一个个解决了，生产自然就持续上去了。
    时刻保持着大干的雄心又不断地进行细致的踏实的工作，我们的钢铁生产就一定能持续地大幅度地上升再上升。
