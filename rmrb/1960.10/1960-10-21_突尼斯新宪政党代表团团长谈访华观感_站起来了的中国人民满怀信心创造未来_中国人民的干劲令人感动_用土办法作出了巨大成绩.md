The head of the Tunisian Neo Destour Party delegation, Ben Amar Hassib, met with Xinhua News Agency reporters in Beijing on the 19th to discuss his impressions of his visit to China.

Ben Amar Hassib said, "Our visit to China this time is to bring the fraternal greetings of the Tunisian people to the Chinese people and to understand and learn from China's experience in revolution and construction."

Speaking about the impressions of his delegation's visit to China, Ben Amar Hassib said, "What impresses us most is the drive and enthusiasm of the Chinese people. Whether in factories or in the countryside, we have seen with our own eyes that the Chinese people, who have stood up, are full of confidence in creating their own bright future."

He said, "We have seen the tremendous efforts made by the Chinese people to build heavy and light industry. We have seen that the leaders of New China not only pay attention to the development of the economy but also pay attention to the improvement of people's cultural and technical levels and their welfare. The organization of Chinese factories has impressed us deeply. The factory leadership pays special attention to improving the workers' awareness and educating them to realize that the interests of the individual are inseparable from the interests of the collective. The factory also pays great attention to continuously improving the technical level of employees and further improving their living conditions. All this has led to continuous improvements in labor productivity. This is a fact we have seen with our own eyes."

The delegation visited many medium and small-sized enterprises in various parts of China. Ben Amar Hassib said, "What moves us deeply is that the Chinese people, with drive and unremitting efforts, have made such great achievements with simple indigenous methods. We especially admire them for starting from scratch and achieving mechanization. This proves how much creativity the Chinese people can unleash when they work not for others but for themselves."

Ben Amar Hassib pointed out that the facts that the delegation witnessed in China and the enthusiasm and drive of the Chinese people demonstrate how absurd the claims of some Western newspapers that the Chinese people are subjected to "forced labor" are.

He said, "I believe that China's current system will definitely guarantee further improvements in the people's living standards. Because it proceeds from the highest interests of the Chinese people, mobilizes all forces to strive for the complete victory of socialist construction, and guarantees China a brighter future; it is precisely for this purpose that the Chinese people prefer to live a relatively frugal life now, even though they have the conditions to live a better life." Ben Amar Hassib said, "We will always remember this visit to China and are very happy to convey the fraternal friendship of the Chinese people to the Tunisian people."

    突尼斯新宪政党代表团团长谈访华观感
    站起来了的中国人民满怀信心创造未来
    中国人民的干劲令人感动　用土办法作出了巨大成绩
    突尼斯新宪政党代表团团长本·阿玛尔·哈西卜19日在北京接见新华社记者，谈访华观感。
    本·阿玛尔·哈西卜说：“我们这次到中国来是给中国人民带来突尼斯人民兄弟般的敬礼，并了解和汲取中国的革命和建设的经验。”
    谈到他率领的代表团在我国参观访问的印象时，本·阿玛尔·哈西卜说：“给我们印象最深的，是中国人民的干劲和热情。无论在工厂或农村，我们到处亲眼看到已经站起来了的中国人民满怀信心地创造着自己美好的未来。”
    他说：“我们看到了中国人民为建设重工业和轻工业所作的巨大努力。我们看到了新中国的领导人不仅注意发展经济而且也很注意人们的文化和技术水平以及生活福利的提高。中国工厂的组织工作给我们很深的印象。工厂领导上特别注意提高工人们的觉悟，教育工人使他们认识到个人的利益是与集体的利益分不开的。工厂还很注意不断提高职工的技术水平并进一步改善他们的生活条件。这一切，使得劳动生产率不断提高。这是我们亲眼看到的事实。”
    代表团在我国各地参观了许多中、小型企业。本·阿玛尔·哈西卜说：“使我们深为感动的，是中国人民以干劲和坚持不懈的努力，用简易的土办法作出了那样大的成绩。我们特别钦佩他们从零点开始，实现了机械化。这证明了，当中国人民不是为别人而是为自己劳动时，能够发挥多么大的创造性。”
    本·阿玛尔·哈西卜指出，代表团在中国亲眼看到的事实和中国人民的热情和干劲，说明一些西方报刊所谓中国人民被“强迫劳动”的说法是何等的谬误。
    他说：“我相信中国现在的制度一定能够保证人民的生活水平进一步提高。因为它从中国人民的最高利益出发，动员一切力量争取社会主义建设的彻底胜利，保证中国有更光辉的未来；正是为了这个目的，中国人民宁愿现在过比较节俭的生活，虽然他们有条件过更好的生活。”本·阿玛尔·哈西卜说：“我们将永远记住对中国的这次访问，并且十分高兴向突尼斯人民转达中国人民兄弟般的情谊。”
