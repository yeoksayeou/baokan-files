Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 8th. More than a thousand residents of Marianao City near Havana held a friendship and unity meeting with the People's Republic of China last night.

Marianao Mayor Olmin Fernández said in his speech that the People's Republic of China is a great example for the people of all countries fighting against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism. "In this example, we see that as long as the people are united, they will surely achieve victory." He pointed out that the Chinese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea shows that "imperialism and reactionaries, as Mao Zedong said, are paper tigers." The mayor condemned U.S. imperialism for occupying China's territory of Taiwan with the Seventh Fleet and expressed support for the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan. He pointed out that the seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations must be restored.

Ignacio Betancourt, the representative of the "July 26th Movement" in Marianao, said in his speech, "The Chinese people stand on the side of the world's people struggling for liberation. We know that the Chinese people support us, and we are proud of this support."

Bernardo Hernández, the General Secretary of the Marianao Municipal Committee of the People's Socialist Party, said at the meeting that during his visit to ten cities in China, he personally saw that the most populous country in the world was standing on the side of the Cuban revolution. He said that at a time when U.S. imperialism is stepping up its aggression, the People's Republic of China is more firmly supporting the people of Cuba and Latin America.

Also speaking at the meeting were Orestes Mesa, the representative of the Marianao Rebel Army Youth League, Manuel Quervo, the representative of the "July 26th Movement" in Havana Province, and Eugenio Rodriguez, the Secretary of the Marianao Municipal Revolutionary Guidance Committee. Eugenio condemned the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and pointed out that this is one of the lies invented by U.S. imperialism to enslave the people of the world.

The conference was organized by the Marianao City Government and some revolutionary organizations to celebrate the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the People's Republic of China and the Chinese National Day. The meeting was filled with enthusiasm and a friendly atmosphere. During the meeting, people kept cheering: Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the friendship between the Cuban and Chinese people! Cuba and China, yes! Yankees, no! The conference concluded with the screening of several Chinese documentaries. (Attached picture)

    “7月26日运动”马里安那奥市代表伊姆纳西奥·贝坦科尔特在讲话中说，“中国人民站在为争取解放而斗争的世界人民的这一边。我们知道，中国人民支持我们，我们对这一支持感到骄傲。”

    在会上发言的还有马里安那奥起义军青年联合会的代表奥雷斯特·梅萨，哈瓦那省“7月26日运动”的代表曼努埃尔·奎尔沃以及马里安那奥市革命指导委员会书记欧亨尼奥·罗德里格斯。欧亨尼奥谴责美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋，并指出这是美帝国主义为奴役世界人民而发明的漫天谎言之一。
    这次大会是由马里安那奥市政府和一些革命组织为庆祝古巴和中华人民共和国建交和中国国庆而组织的，会上充满着热情和友好的气氛。在会议进行中，人们不断地欢呼：中华人民共和国万岁！古巴人民和中国人民的友谊万岁！要古巴，要中国，不要美国佬！大会最后放映了几部中国纪录片。（附图片）
