Long Live the Militant Friendship Between the Chinese and Algerian People!

The delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, headed by Prime Minister Abbas Ferhat—glorious envoys of the heroic Algerian people—is concluding its friendly visit to China today. During these days, the Chinese people warmly welcomed Prime Minister Abbas and the other distinguished Algerian guests, and were very grateful to Prime Minister Abbas for bringing the Chinese people the precious militant friendship of the Algerian people. Today, Prime Minister Abbas is about to leave China. We are convinced that Prime Minister Abbas will bring back to Algeria the brotherly friendship and high respect of the 650 million Chinese people for the Algerian people, and convey it to every fighting Algerian brother, to every Algerian people's heart that loves their sacred motherland and yearns for independence and freedom.

The Chinese people are pleased to know that during these short days, Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Liu Shaoqi had lengthy meetings with Prime Minister Abbas. Premier Zhou Enlai held cordial and sincere talks with Prime Minister Abbas Ferhat on the situation of the Algerian struggle, the further development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Algeria, the situation in the Asian-African region, and the current international situation, and reached satisfactory agreement. Today, this newspaper publishes the Joint Communiqué of the Governments of China and Algeria. This communiqué shows that the Governments and peoples of China and Algeria have consistent views on the above-mentioned issues of common concern, and demonstrates the great solidarity and mutual support of our two peoples in the cause of opposing imperialism and defending world peace.

The Joint Communiqué clearly points out that the resolute struggle against the imperialist policy of aggression and war, and for freedom and peace, is the urgent and primary political task of the people of all countries. Imperialist aggression is the source of war and all evils; without eradicating this source, mankind cannot enjoy universal and lasting peace. Isn't the tension in the Taiwan Strait caused by the U.S. imperialism's armed occupation of China's territory Taiwan and its continuous military provocations against the Chinese people? Isn't the tension in the Caribbean Sea caused by U.S. imperialism's aggression and interference in Cuba? Isn't the Algerian war imposed on the Algerian people by the French aggressors with the support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headed by the United States? Isn't the peace of the Congo and the peace of Laos also undermined by the aggression and interference of U.S. imperialism? Therefore, it is very clear that all obstacles and threats to world peace come from imperialism, headed by the United States. In order to realize lasting world peace, the people of all countries in the world must unite and wage a resolute and unremitting struggle against the imperialist policy of aggression and war. The Joint Communiqué emphasizes this point, which undoubtedly has great practical significance for the current struggle of the people of the world to defend peace.

In order to cover up the aggressive and bellicose face of imperialism, the propagandists of imperialism have shamelessly slandered the Chinese people, the Lao people, the Algerian people, the Cuban people, and all people who love peace and oppose imperialist aggression as "bellicose" and "disrupting peace and order," etc. It is clear that this kind of slanderous propaganda of imperialism, which reverses black and white, is an attempt to confuse the public and promote their policies of aggression and war under the guise of "peace." Their intention is to allow only imperialism to carry out aggression and enslavement against the people of all countries, and not to allow the people of all countries to oppose imperialist aggression and enslavement. The Joint Communiqué of the Governments of China and Algeria gives a powerful response to this kind of propaganda by imperialism which reverses black and white. The communiqué solemnly points out that the national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries and the actions of the people of all countries in the world to strive for democracy and social progress have made significant contributions to the overall struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and in defense of world peace. The current national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are an extremely important force for maintaining world peace. The struggle of the people of all countries in the world against imperialist aggression and enslavement is a great contribution to the cause of defending world peace. Here, we must especially mention the incomparably heroic Algerian people and the Cuban people, who stand at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism, and who have already made and will continue to make great contributions in the cause of defending world peace, thus winning the sympathy, support, and enthusiastic praise of all peace-loving people in the world.

At present, the development of the international situation is unprecedentedly favorable to the struggle of the people of the world to defend world peace and to the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Governments of China and Algeria expressed the unshakable belief of the peoples of China and Algeria that as long as the people persist in struggle and form a broad united front against imperialism, they will surely be able to defeat imperialism and colonialism, obtain and maintain national independence, and defend world peace. Now, the great union of the people of socialist countries with all the oppressed people of the world, the great union of the working people of Western countries with the oppressed nations of the East, the great union of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries in the common struggle against imperialism, and the great union of the people of all countries in the world against imperialism, are all developing rapidly. This is because the people of the world have a common enemy, namely imperialism, first of all U.S. imperialism; and the people of the world are waging a common struggle, namely the struggle against imperialism, first of all against U.S. imperialism. In the Joint Communiqué, the Governments of China and Algeria warmly congratulated the increasing strengthening of the friendship and unity of the people of Asia, Africa, and other countries in their common struggle, and solemnly declared: resolutely support the just struggle of the people of the Congo, the people of South Africa, the people of Laos, the people of Cuba, and the people of other countries to strive for and maintain national independence, and strongly condemn the governments of the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, mainly the U.S. government, for supporting the French government's colonial suppression and continued war of aggression against Algeria; and call on the people of all countries in the world, especially the people of Asia and Africa, to rise up and take effective measures to support the just struggle of the people of these countries. This fully demonstrates that the peoples of China and Algeria not only hold high the banner of opposition to imperialism and resolutely wage the struggle against imperialism, but also regard sympathy and support for the just struggle of the people of Asian and African countries as our common task. The peoples of China and Algeria are making common efforts to establish and strengthen the united front of the people of the world against imperialism.

It is precisely under the sacred banner of opposing imperialism that the Chinese people and the Algerian people are carrying out brotherly mutual support and assistance. The Chinese people have always admired and resolutely supported the national liberation struggle of the Algerian people. In the Joint Communiqué, the Chinese government reiterated its firm position of unswervingly supporting the just struggle of the Algerian people. The Chinese government supports the Algerian people, who persist in and strengthen the armed struggle in the fight for national independence, without excluding negotiations on an equal basis, which negotiations help to expose the other party's deception. The position of our government and people in supporting the just struggle of the Algerian people is unshakable. As Premier Zhou Enlai announced at the banquet welcoming Prime Minister Abbas, "In order to support the national liberation struggle of the Algerian people, we are willing to do everything we can. We have been, are, and will be so in the future." The Chinese people are convinced that the heroic Algerian people, with the support of the people of all countries in the world, will persist in struggle, and will surely defeat all aggressors, completely and thoroughly liberate their territory, and achieve the final victory in the national liberation struggle. At the same time, in the Joint Communiqué, the Algerian side expressed its appreciation for the contributions made by the liberated Chinese people in defending world peace, opposing imperialist aggression, and supporting the national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and fully supported the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate their territory Taiwan. The Chinese people sincerely thank the praise and support from the fighting Algerian people. We consider this praise and support as an encouragement to the Chinese people. In fact, the Algerian peoples' struggle against imperialism and every victory in this struggle is an encouragement and support for the Chinese people. The Chinese and Algerian people have been mutually supporting and encouraging each other in the common struggle against imperialism.

Through Prime Minister Abbas's visit, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Algeria based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have been further strengthened. In the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and Algeria, the two sides have studied various ways to enhance the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. Although the peoples of China and Algeria are separated by vast oceans, we are closely related and share weal and woe. Our two peoples have forged a precious militant friendship in the common struggle against imperialism, and this friendship cannot be undermined by any force. The Algerian people can fully believe that in your struggle for national liberation, the 650 million Chinese people will always be your most loyal and reliable friends.

    中阿两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    以阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团——英雄阿尔及利亚人民的光荣的使者们，今天结束了在中国的友好访问。这些天里，中国人民热烈地欢迎了阿巴斯总理和阿尔及利亚的其他贵宾们，并且十分感谢阿巴斯总理为中国人民带来了阿尔及利亚人民珍贵的战斗的友谊。今天，阿巴斯总理就要离开中国了，我们深信，阿巴斯总理将把六亿五千万中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民的兄弟般的友谊和崇高敬意带回阿尔及利亚，传达给每一个战斗着的阿尔及利亚的兄弟，传达给每一颗热爱自己神圣祖国，向往独立和自由的阿尔及利亚人民的心。
    中国人民高兴地知道，在这些短暂的日子里，毛泽东主席和刘少奇主席同阿巴斯总理作了长时间的会见。周恩来总理同阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理就阿尔及利亚的斗争形势和进一步发展中阿两国友好合作关系、亚非地区形势和当前国际形势等问题进行了亲切诚挚的会谈，并且满意地取得了一致的意见。今天本报发表了中阿两国政府的联合公报，这个公报显示了中阿两国政府和人民对于上述共同关心的问题具有一致的看法，显示了我们两国人民在反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平事业中的伟大的团结和相互的支援。
    联合公报明确地指出，反对帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策，争取自由与和平的坚决斗争是世界各国人民的迫切的首要的政治任务。帝国主义的侵略是战争和一切邪恶的根源；不根除这个根源，人类是不可能享受普遍而持久的和平的。台湾海峡的紧张局势，难道不是由于美帝国主义武力侵占中国领土台湾，向中国人民不断进行军事挑衅所造成的吗？加勒比海的紧张局势，难道不是由于美帝国主义侵略和干涉古巴所引起的吗？阿尔及利亚战争难道不是法国侵略者在以美国为首的北大西洋公约组织支持下强加于阿尔及利亚人民的吗？刚果的和平、老挝的和平，又难道不都是被美帝国主义的侵略和干涉所破坏了吗？因此，事情很明白，世界和平的一切障碍和威胁，都是来自以美国为首的帝国主义方面。为了实现世界的持久和平，全世界各国人民必须团结起来，对帝国主义的侵略和战争政策，进行坚决不懈的斗争。联合公报强调指出这一点，对于当前全世界人民保卫和平的斗争，无疑地具有重大的现实意义。
    帝国主义的宣传家们为了掩盖帝国主义的侵略和好战面目，他们竟无耻地反诬中国人民、老挝人民、阿尔及利亚人民、古巴人民和一切爱好和平、反对帝国主义侵略的人民为“好战”、为“破坏和平和秩序”等等。很清楚，帝国主义的这种颠倒黑白的诬蔑宣传，是企图鱼目混珠，在“和平”的幌子下，推行它们的侵略和战争政策，其居心是，只许帝国主义对各国人民进行侵略和奴役，而不许各国人民反对帝国主义的侵略和奴役。中阿两国政府的联合公报给予帝国主义的这种颠倒黑白的宣传以有力的回击。公报严正地指出，殖民地、半殖民地的民族解放运动和世界各国人民争取民主和社会进步的行动，对上述的全世界人民反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的总斗争都作出了重大的贡献。当前亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动，是维护世界和平的一支极为重要的力量。世界各国人民反对帝国主义侵略和奴役的斗争，都是对保卫世界和平事业的巨大贡献。在这里，我们必须特别提到无比英勇的阿尔及利亚人民和古巴人民，他们站在反对帝国主义斗争的最前线，他们在保卫世界和平的事业中已经并将继续建树伟大的功勋，因而赢得了全世界一切爱好和平人民的同情、支持和热烈的赞扬。
    目前，国际形势的发展，对全世界人民保卫世界和平的斗争，对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主运动，空前有利。中阿两国政府表达了中阿两国人民的这种不可动摇的信念，即只要人民坚持斗争，结成反对帝国主义广泛的统一战线，就一定能够击败帝国主义和殖民主义，获得和维护民族独立，保卫住世界和平。现在，社会主义各国人民同全世界一切被压迫人民的大联合，西方各国的劳动人民同东方被压迫民族的大联合，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民在反对帝国主义共同斗争中的大联合，世界各国人民反对帝国主义的大联合，都在迅速地发展中。这是因为，全世界人民有着一个共同的敌人，那就是帝国主义，首先是美帝国主义；全世界人民进行着共同的斗争，那就是反对帝国主义，首先是反对美帝国主义的斗争。中阿两国政府在联合公报中，热烈祝贺亚洲、非洲和各国人民在共同斗争中的友谊和团结的日益加强，并且庄严地宣布：坚决支持刚果人民、南非人民、老挝人民、古巴人民和其他各国人民争取和维护民族独立的正义斗争，并且强烈地谴责北大西洋公约组织各国的政府，主要是美国政府，支持法国政府的殖民镇压和继续侵略阿尔及利亚战争；呼吁世界各国人民特别是亚非人民起来采取有效措施支持这些国家人民的正义斗争。这一点充分地表明了，中阿两国人民不仅高举反对帝国主义的大旗，坚决进行反对帝国主义的斗争，并且把同情和支持亚洲、非洲各国人民的正义斗争视为我们共同的任务。中阿两国人民正在为建立和加强全世界人民反对帝国主义的统一战线，进行着共同的努力。
    中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民正是在反对帝国主义的神圣旗帜下，进行着兄弟般的互相支持和援助。中国人民一向钦佩和坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争。在联合公报中，中国政府重申其始终不渝地支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争的坚定立场。中国政府支持坚持和加强武装斗争的阿尔及利亚人民在争取民族独立的战斗中，不排除在平等基础上进行的谈判，这种谈判有助于揭露对方的欺骗。我国政府和人民支持阿尔及利亚人民正义斗争的这一立场是不可动摇的。正如周恩来总理在欢迎阿巴斯总理的宴会上所宣布的，“为了支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争，我们愿意尽力做我们能做的一切。我们过去、现在和将来，都是这样。”中国人民确信，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民在世界各国人民支持下坚持斗争，一定能够战胜一切侵略者，全部彻底地解放自己的国土，取得民族解放斗争的最后胜利。同时，在联合公报中，阿尔及利亚方面对于解放了的中国人民在保卫世界和平，反对帝国主义侵略和支持殖民地、半殖民地的民族解放运动的事业中所作的贡献表示赞扬，并且完全支持中国人民解放自己的领土台湾的正义斗争。中国人民衷心地感谢来自战斗的阿尔及利亚人民的赞扬和支持。我们把这种赞扬和支持视为对中国人民的鼓舞。事实上阿尔及利亚人民反对帝国主义的斗争和这一斗争的每一项胜利，都是对于中国人民的鼓舞和支持。中阿两国人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中一直是互相支持，互相鼓舞的。
    通过阿巴斯总理的这次访问，中阿两国之间在和平共处五项原则基础上的友好合作关系得到了进一步的加强。在中阿两国总理的会谈中，双方已经研究了增进两国友好合作关系的各种途径。中阿两国人民虽然远隔重洋，但我们却是休戚相关，忧乐与共的。我们两国人民在反对帝国主义的共同的斗争中结成了珍贵的战斗的友谊，这种友谊是任何势力所不可能破坏的。阿尔及利亚人民完全可以相信，在你们争取民族解放的斗争中，六亿五千万中国人民永远是你们最忠诚、最可靠的朋友。
