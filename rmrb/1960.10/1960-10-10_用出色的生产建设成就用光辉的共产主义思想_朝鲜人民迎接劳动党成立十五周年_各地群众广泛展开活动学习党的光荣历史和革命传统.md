    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th - The Korean people are widely launching commemorative activities in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea (October 10).
    In recent days, various regions and departments have held report meetings. Local leading comrades gave reports on topics such as "The Glorious History of Struggle of the Workers' Party of Korea," "The Workers' Party of Korea is the Organizer and Inspirer of All Victories of the Korean People," and "On the Revolutionary Tradition Inherited by Our Party."
    In Pyongyang, Kimchon County, and other places, during the commemorative activities, the masses met with Korean veteran anti-Japanese guerrillas such as Comrade Park Young-soon and Comrade Kim Ja-rin, and asked them to report on the deeds of Korean communists under the leadership of Comrade Kim Il-sung in their arduous struggle against Japanese imperialism and domestic and foreign enemies.
    In recent days, youths from Hamhung Higher Chemical Industry School, Sariwon Normal University, and the Sonchon Veterans Hospital in North Pyongan Province have also launched a movement to read books on communist education and revolutionary tradition education, and held discussion meetings to talk about their experiences.
    In order to strengthen revolutionary tradition education, local party organizations have organized many visiting groups to visit the revolutionary battlefields of the anti-Japanese guerrillas. More than 900 students from Pyongyang Kim Chaek University of Technology and other universities and colleges participated in road construction and the construction of the "People's Hero Tower" during their visits.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th - In order to welcome the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea (October 10), the working people in various parts of northern Korea have launched a vigorous labor emulation campaign, and good news of increased production is frequently reported.
    The thin plate workshop of the Hwanghae Iron and Steel Works has recently exceeded the daily production plan by 30% every day. The average daily output of thin plates in October has increased from 121 tons in August to 200 tons, and in September it was 176 tons. The steel rolling workshop of this factory once proposed to mechanize four working machines before the anniversary of the founding of the Party, and now three of them have been completed, and one is being tested. Due to the increase in the degree of mechanization, coupled with the support of other departments, the utilization rate of the rolling mill has increased by 13% compared with the original plan, and labor productivity has increased by 25%.
    The staff and workers of the Seongjin Steel Plant, which produces special steel, greatly increased their enthusiasm for increasing production after the report meeting to commemorate the Party's birthday. They overfulfilled the third quarter plan by 28.1% and expressed their determination to complete the annual plan before October 20, and to increase the production of 15,000 tons of steel and 39,000 tons of steel products this year.
    In the labor emulation movement, the workers paid great attention to technological innovation and did everything possible to tap potential. At the construction site of the polyvinyl chloride factory, the Kim In-muk work team created a kind of assembly board, which increased labor efficiency by 15 times in the assembly of 22,400 meters of piping. Due to continuous technological reforms, the Lee Bok-gyu work team of Aoji Coal Mine mined 700 to 1,000 tons of coal every day in late September, and in September also created a new record of mining more than 15,000 tons of coal in one coal mining face. In addition, the Sinuiju Textile Factory, on the basis of tapping potential, has started a upsurge of "increasing production by 7,000 meters of cloth every day" since October 1. They are determined to increase production by 550,000 meters of cloth in the fourth quarter as a gift to the Party's birthday.
    In order to greet the Party's birthday with greater labor achievements, agricultural cooperatives in various regions are concentrating their efforts on autumn harvest and autumn sowing. At present, more than 8,000 tractors across the country are participating in field labor. Many cadres and students from government offices have gone to the countryside to help agricultural cooperatives with the autumn harvest. According to preliminary statistics, more than 104,000 chongbo of paddy rice and more than 200,000 chongbo of corn have been harvested across the country, and more than half of the autumn wheat sowing plan has been completed. Many agricultural cooperatives have expressed their determination to complete the harvest before the birthday of the Workers' Party and hand over the tax in kind in advance. In addition to proposing an increased production plan of producing 2,000 tons of duck meat this year, the masses of the Kwangpo State Ranch are determined to arm themselves with communist ideology and revolutionary tradition and become red fighters loyal to the Party.

    新华社平壤9日电　朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党建党十五周年（10月10日）前夕，广泛地展开了纪念活动。
    近几天来，各地和各部门纷纷举行报告会。当地的领导同志分别以“朝鲜劳动党光荣的斗争历史”、“朝鲜劳动党是朝鲜人民一切胜利的组织者和鼓舞者”和“关于我们党所继承的革命传统”等为题作了报告。
    平壤市、金川郡等地的群众在纪念活动中，会见了朝鲜老抗日游击队员朴永淳、金子麟等同志，并且请他们报告朝鲜共产主义者在金日成同志领导下同日本帝国主义和国内外敌人进行艰苦斗争的事迹。
    这些天来，咸兴高等化学工业学校、沙里院师范大学、平安北道宣川荣誉军人医院的青年们还展开了一个阅读有关共产主义教育和革命传统教育书籍的运动，并且召开讨论会，漫谈心得。
    各地党组织为了加强革命传统教育，组织了很多参观团，到抗日游击队的革命战场去参观访问。平壤市金策工业大学等高等学校的九百多名学生，在参观访问时还参加了筑路和建筑“人民英雄塔”的劳动。
    新华社平壤9日电　为迎接朝鲜劳动党建党十五周年（10月10日），朝鲜北方各地劳动人民展开了热火朝天的劳动竞赛运动，增产喜讯频频传来。
    黄海制铁所薄板车间最近每天都超额30％完成日生产计划。10月份的薄板平均日产量已从8月份的一百二十一吨提高到了二百吨，9月份是一百七十六吨。这个工厂的轧钢车间曾提出要在建党纪念日以前使四项工作机械化，现在已经完成三项，还有一项正在试用。由于机械化程度提高，加上其他部门的支援，轧钢机利用率比原计划提高13％，劳动生产率提高了25％。
    生产特殊钢的城津炼钢厂的职工们在纪念党的生日的报告会后，增产热情大大提高。他们超额28.1％完成了第三季度计划，并表示决心争取在10月20日以前完成全年计划，要在今年增产一万五千吨钢和三万九千吨钢材。
    在劳动竞赛运动中，工人们十分注重技术革新和千方百计地挖掘潜力。在建设聚氯乙烯工厂的工地上，金仁默作业班创制成功一种装配板，在装配二万二千四百米的配管作业中提高了劳动效率十五倍。阿吾地煤矿李福奎作业班由于不断进行技术改革，9月下旬每天采煤七百吨到一千吨，9月份还创造了在一个采煤工作面采煤一万五千多吨的新纪录。另外，新义州纺织工厂在挖掘潜力的基础上，从10月1日开始，掀起了“每天增产七千米布”的热潮。他们决心在第四季度增产五十五万米布，作为向党的生日的献礼。
    各地农业合作社为了以更大的劳动成绩迎接党的生日，正在集中力量进行秋收、秋种。目前全国已有八千多台拖拉机参加田间劳动。许多机关干部和学生下乡帮助农业社秋收。据初步统计，全国已经收割水稻十万四千多町步，玉米二十多万町步，秋小麦播种计划已完成一半以上。许多农业社都表示决心，在劳动党的生日之前完成收割任务，提前交完现物税。国营广浦牧场的群众除了提出在今年生产二千吨鸭肉的增产计划以外，还决心用共产主义思想和革命传统武装起来，成为忠实于党的红色战士。
