(Our dispatch from Shenyang, 11th) Rural canteens in Liaoning Province are seizing the time to collect firewood and dry vegetables, actively preparing for winter.

In the cold climate of Liaoning, properly arranging for the winter in canteens is an important task. Finding ways to ensure commune members stay warm and eat hot food has become a major concern for Party committees at all levels. In accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, many cities and counties have earnestly deployed winter preparations for the canteens. The primary task for rural canteens in winter is to solve the heating problem. Currently, many canteens have renovated dining halls, built fire walls and heated brick beds (kang) in accordance with farmers' habits, and stored sufficient firewood. Chang'an Commune's Changpao Brigade in Andong County organized labor to go deep into the thirteen small team canteens and commune members' homes, repairing and building over one hundred fire walls and heated brick beds, ensuring that commune members have warm rooms to eat in and warm beds to sleep on in winter. Machong Brigade of Changtuzhan Commune in Changtu County has recently successfully tested three types of simple, economical, and practical earth hot-air stoves (earth central heating), which have been promoted to canteens and nurseries throughout the brigade. Pingfangzi Commune in Kazuo County has also built new dining halls, and for some households far from the canteens, the method of "unified arrangement and dining in separate halls" has been adopted, greatly facilitating the masses. Many canteens in mountainous areas have also organized commune members to collect firewood for winter use. Heping Brigade of Baijiagou Commune in Faku County implemented contracted quotas, mobilizing commune members to collect firewood in the early mornings and evenings.

Storing a large amount of non-staple foods, improving food management, and ensuring that commune members eat their fill and eat well are also important tasks for canteens in winter. Five canteens in the Hongqi Brigade of Hongqi Commune in Faku County have already pickled forty vats of pickles. While storing a large amount of non-staple foods, canteens in various places have also made comprehensive arrangements for planned grain usage and economical grain usage. Rural canteens in the Dalian City area have allocated rations to households on a monthly and daily basis, implementing rational grain usage and grain-vegetable adjustments to ensure that commune members eat their fill and eat well.

Rural canteens in various parts of Liaoning, combined with preparing for winter, have also widely carried out comparison and upgrading movements. The results of a comparison carried out among one thousand two hundred and twenty-five rural canteens in Heishan County, focusing on winter preparations, showed that Class One canteens rose from the original 15% to 45%, and Class Three canteens decreased from 20% to 12%. The comparison and upgrading movement of canteens in various places is still ongoing.

(Our dispatch from Chengdu, 11th) Qingbai Commune's First Management District in Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, after the autumn grain harvest, properly arranged the lives of commune members, striving to start from the top of the grain pile and grasp economy from the very beginning.

In order to do a good job in saving grain, many commune members actively put forward suggestions for planned grain use. Based on the suggestions of commune members, the Party branch put forward the following methods:

(1) On the basis of determining the quantity of grain per person, make overall arrangements for grain use throughout the year according to the amount and intensity of farm work in various periods. This not only ensures that commune members eat their fill and eat well but also prevents waste.

(2) Increase the planting of a season of late-autumn coarse grain crops to allow for a mix of coarse and fine grains. This area is a major rice-producing area, and farmers mainly eat rice. This year, after the rice harvest, taking advantage of the gap before the spring sowing, over eight hundred mu of late-autumn crops such as autumn potatoes, carrots, and mud beans were planted, and these crops can be harvested around the beginning of winter.

(3) Do a good job in vegetable production. The entire management district will make full use of existing vegetable plots and canteen vegetable gardens, vigorously carry out intercropping and mixed cropping, increase the multiple cropping index, and increase vegetable production; at the same time, try to intercrop and mixed crop some short-growing vegetables in late autumn and spring fields; and mobilize commune members to use the front and back of houses, field ridges, and field edges to increase vegetable planting wherever possible. The entire management district plans to produce two million jin of vegetables, ensuring that commune members have enough vegetables to eat.

(4) Improve cooking skills and increase variety.

In order to strengthen this work, the branch secretary is in command, and each team also has a deputy captain specifically responsible for leading this work.

At present, an atmosphere of saving grain has been formed in the entire management district. All seven canteens have made plans and specific arrangements for saving grain.

    打柴晒菜　修缮饭厅　让社员住暖吃好
    辽宁农村食堂准备过冬工作
    四川清白公社第一管理区订出秋收后计划用粮办法
    本报沈阳11日电　辽宁省各地农村食堂，抓紧时间打柴晒菜，积极做好过冬准备。
    在气候寒冷的辽宁，妥善安排食堂过冬是一项重要工作。想法让社员住得暖、吃得热，已经成了各级党委普遍关心的大事。依照省委的指示，许多市县都认真部署了食堂过冬工作。农村食堂过冬首要的是解决取暖问题。目前，许多食堂都按照农民习惯，整修了饭厅，搭了火墙火炕，贮备下足够的烧柴。安东县长安公社长泡大队，组织劳力深入十三个小队食堂和社员家中，修盘火炕、火墙一百多处，做到社员冬季吃饭有暖屋、睡觉有热炕。昌图县昌图站公社马仲大队，最近试验成功三种构造简单、经济适用的土热风炉（土暖气），已推广到全大队的食堂和托儿所。喀左县平房子公社还新建了一部分餐厅，对一部分距离食堂较远的农户，采取了“统一安排、分厅吃饭”的办法，大大方便了群众。不少山区食堂还组织社员大打冬季用柴。法库县柏家沟公社和平大队，实行包工定额，发动社员利用早晚时间打柴。
    大量贮备副食品，改善伙食管理，保证社员吃饱吃好，也是食堂过冬的重要工作。法库县红旗公社红旗田大队五个食堂，已淹咸菜四十缸。各地食堂在大量贮备副食品的同时，对计划用粮、节约用粮也作了全面安排。旅大市地区各农村食堂，已把口粮按月、按日落实到户，实行合理用粮、粮菜调剂，保证社员吃饱吃好。
    辽宁各地农村食堂，结合做好过冬准备，还广泛开展了评比升级运动。黑山县一千二百二十五个农村食堂，围绕过冬准备工作进行评比的结果，一类食堂由原来的15％上升为45％，三类食堂由20％下降为12％。各地食堂的评比升级运动还在继续进行。
    本报成都11日电　四川省新繁县清白公社第一管理区，在秋粮收获之后，妥善安排社员生活，争取从粮囤尖上着手，一开始就抓紧节约。
    为了做好节约用粮的工作，不少社员积极提出计划用粮的建议。根据社员建议，党支部提出以下几种办法：
    （一）在以人定量的基础上，按照各个时期农活多少、轻重，作好全年用粮的统筹安排。这样既保证社员吃饱吃好，又防止了抛撒浪费。
    （二）增种一季晚秋粗粮作物，使粗、细粮搭配食用。这里是水稻主产区，农民以食大米为主。今年在水稻收获后，利用在小春播种前的空隙，增种八百多亩秋洋芋、胡萝卜、泥豆等晚秋作物，这些作物在立冬前后即可收获。
    （三）搞好蔬菜生产。全管理区充分利用原有蔬菜地和食堂的菜园，大搞套种、间种，提高复种指数，增加蔬菜产量；同时在晚秋、小春地里尽量设法套种、间种一些生长期较短的蔬菜；并发动社员家家户户利用屋前、屋后、田坎、地边，见缝插针增种蔬菜。全管理区计划生产蔬菜二百万斤，保证社员有足够的菜吃。
    （四）改进炊事技术，增加花色品种。
    为了加强这一工作，支部书记挂帅，各队也有一个副队长具体负责领导这一工作。
    目前，全管理区已形成节约用粮的风气。七个食堂都已作出节约用粮的计划和具体安排。
