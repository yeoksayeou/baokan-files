Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 23rd: General Kim Kwang-hyup, Vice Premier of the Cabinet and Minister of National Defense of North Korea, delivered a speech at the welcoming rally held at Pyongyang Railway Station today upon the arrival of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation. The full text is as follows: Respected Comrade He Long! Dear comrades of the Chinese Military Delegation! Dear comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Art Troupe! Comrades!

Today, our people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army greet with great joy the Military Delegation of the People's Republic of China headed by respected Comrade He Long, and the Art Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who have come to visit our country with the delegation.

On behalf of all the Korean people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army, I extend a sincere and warm welcome to the distinguished guests who have come to our country for a friendly visit.

Our people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army welcome our closest comrades-in-arms with boundless excitement.

Korea and China are neighbors separated only by a river and bordering each other. The people and armies of our two countries are comrades-in-arms who have forged a flesh-and-blood friendship in the long struggle against common enemies.

The traditional friendship and solidarity between the people and armies of Korea and China demonstrated its invincible power during our Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggression of US imperialism.

During the most difficult period of the Fatherland Liberation War, the Chinese people held high the banner of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and sent volunteers composed of their outstanding sons and daughters to aid the Korean people with their blood.

The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers fought alongside the Korean People's Army, repelled the enemy's invasion, defended the territory of our country, and established great feats of arms in fierce battles.

The power of the solidarity of the people and armies of Korea and China caused the US imperialist aggressors to suffer their first shameful defeat in history, completely shattering the myth of US imperialism's "strength."

The traditional friendship and solidarity between the people and armies of Korea and China, forged in blood in the long struggle against common enemies and having withstood severe tests, is being strengthened day by day in the struggle for socialist construction and defense of peace in the East in the post-war period.

No force can destroy the traditional friendship and solidarity between the people and armies of Korea and China; it is unbreakable.

Today, the people and armies of Korea and China are firmly united in a resolute struggle to ensure the final defeat of the common enemy—the US imperialists—to defend peace in the Far East and the world, to realize the freedom and independence of the people, and to win the victory of the socialist cause.

Comrades!

During your stay in our country, you will directly see the warm brotherly friendship of our people and army towards the Chinese people and their army, as well as the desire of our people to further strengthen the great bond of Korean-Chinese friendship in various places.

We are confident that your visit to our country will make a great contribution to further consolidating and developing the traditional friendly relations between the people and armies of Korea and China.

Long live the eternal friendship and solidarity between the people and armies of Korea and China!

Long live the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union!

    我代表全体朝鲜人民和人民军官兵衷心地、热烈欢迎来我国进行友好访问的贵宾。

    朝中两国是一江相隔，互相接壤的邻居，我们两国人民和军队，是在反对共同敌人的长期斗争中结成了血肉相连的友好关系的战友。
    朝中两国人民和军队间的传统的友谊和团结，在反对美帝国主义武装侵略者的我们的祖国解放战争时期显示了它的不可战胜的威力。
    在祖国解放战争的最艰难时期，中国人民高举起抗美援朝的旗帜，派遣了以自己的优秀儿女组成的志愿军，以鲜血援助了朝鲜人民。
    中国人民志愿军官兵同朝鲜人民军一道，打退了敌人的侵犯，保卫了我们祖国的疆土，在激烈的战斗中树立了丰功伟绩。
    朝中两国人民和军队的团结的威力，使美帝国主义侵略者遭到它们历史上第一次的可耻的失败，完全粉碎了美帝国主义“强大”的神话。
    朝中两国人民和军队在反对共同的敌人的长期的斗争中以鲜血凝结成的、并经受了严峻考验的传统的友谊和团结，在战后两国进行社会主义建设和保卫东方的和平的斗争中日益加强。
    任何力量也破坏不了朝中两国人民和军队的传统的友谊和团结，它是牢不可破的。
    朝中两国人民和军队今天为了使共同的敌人——美帝国主义者遭到最后失败，为了保卫远东和世界和平，为了使人民的自由独立得到实现和使社会主义事业得到胜利而牢固地团结在一起，进行着坚决的斗争。
    同志们！
    你们在我国逗留的期间内，将在各地直接看到我们人民和军队对中国人民及其军队的热烈的兄弟般的友谊，以及我们人民进一步加强伟大的朝中友谊纽带的愿望。
    我们确信：你们这次访问我国，将为进一步巩固和发展朝中两国人民和军队结成的传统的友好关系而作出巨大贡献。
    朝中两国人民和军队间的永恒的友谊团结万岁！
    以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营的牢不可破的团结一致万岁！
