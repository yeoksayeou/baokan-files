    A Good Example for Cadre Family Members
    Yi Qing
    Comrade Zhang Yinhua is a cadre family member, her husband used to be the district head. She insists on agricultural production and is determined to work in the countryside for the rest of her life. She wants to build a beautiful hometown with her own hands, together with her fellow villagers. She has been active on the front lines of agricultural production for years, working steadily, diligently, enduring hardship before enjoyment. The commune members all praised her, saying: "On the merit book of the Great Leap Forward, we should give Yinhua a shout-out and give her credit." Because of Zhang Yinhua's exemplary role, some cadre family members who were not at ease with agricultural production have changed their minds and established the idea of taking pride in agriculture.
    Zhang Yinhua is doing the right thing. This is entirely in line with the interests of the Party and the 650 million people. Cadre family members, especially those of county, commune, and management district cadres, since most of them "were born and raised in the local soil, can work, and are familiar with the situation," many of them are good soldiers on the agricultural front. Some people are even cadres themselves like Zhang Yinhua. They are not only laborers on the agricultural production front but also leaders in guiding the masses to implement the Party's policies. This spring, when the Party branch of the Nanggao Brigade called on everyone to get involved in large-scale early rice high-yield experiments, Zhang Yinhua took the lead in responding to the Party's call, organizing young women to conduct high-yield experiments, and finally creating a high-yield record on a mountain more than 1,000 meters high.
    Cadre family members participating in agricultural production has even more far-reaching significance. Many peasants are accustomed to handling their own problems by following the example of cadres. When cadre family members participate in agricultural production, the masses can more easily recognize the importance of strengthening the agricultural front when cadres truly put their relatives on the front line of agricultural production; and they will respect the noble style of cadres leading by example, thereby loving agricultural labor, strengthening agricultural production, and establishing a trend of "taking pride in agriculture, enjoying agriculture, engaging in agriculture, and making agriculture their home." Zhang Yinhua resolutely staying in the countryside, and some cadre family members have given up the idea of going out to find work, which is a good proof.
    If cadre family members engaged in agricultural production in the countryside can all be like Zhang Yinhua, rushing to do the most difficult, tiring, and dirty work, working practically, working hard, taking the lead, doing more, and doing well, then a new and active scene will emerge on the front line of agricultural production, creating more high-yield records.

    干部家属的好榜样
    怡清
    张银花同志是干部家属，她的丈夫过去是区长。她坚持农业生产，立志在农村干一辈子。她要用自己的双手，和乡亲们一道建设美好的家乡。她几年如一日地活跃在农业生产最前线，踏踏实实，勤勤恳恳，吃苦在前，享受在后。社员们都称赞说：“在大跃进的功劳簿上，应该给我们银花扬个名，立个功。”由于张银花的模范作用，使得一些原来不安心农业生产的干部家属转变过来，树立了以农为荣的思想。
    张银花作得对。这完全符合党和六亿五千万人民的利益。干部家属，特别是县、公社、管理区的干部家属，由于她们绝大多数“从小土生土长，会劳动，又熟悉情况”，不少人是农业战线上的好战士。有些人还像张银花那样，本身就是干部。她们既是农业生产战线上的劳动者，又是引导群众贯彻执行党的方针政策的带头人。今年春天，南高大队的党支部号召人人动手大搞早稻高产试验的时候，张银花就带头响应党的号召，组织青年妇女大搞高产试验，终于在一千多米的高山上，创造了丰产纪录。
    干部家属参加农业生产，还有更为深远的意义。许多农民习惯于照干部的作法来处理自己的问题。干部家属参加农业生产，群众能够从干部真正把自己的亲人放在农业生产第一线，会更容易认识到加强农业战线的重要意义；并尊敬干部以身作则的高尚风格，从而热爱农业劳动，加强农业生产，树立起“以农为荣、以农为乐、以农为业、以农为家”的风尚。张银花坚决留在农村，有的干部家属也就打消了出去找工作的念头，这就是很好的证明。
    干部家属在农村从事农业生产，如果都能像张银花那样，抢着干最难最累最脏的活，实干，苦干，带头干，干得多，干得好，那末，农业生产第一线更会出现新的活跃景象，创造出更多的丰产纪录来。
