Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 11th - Agerpres Bucharest, 7th October: Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, head of the Romanian delegation to the fifteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly, delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on October 6 on the issue of China's representation in the United Nations.
	Gheorghiu-Dej said: Many countries have spoken on the platform of this session of the General Assembly, advocating that the issue of China's representation in the United Nations should be resolved without delay. The large number of these countries and the significance of this fact itself indicate that this issue has become extremely urgent for the United Nations, so much so that it affects the basis and justification for the existence of this organization. It is now very clear that how to treat the issue of recognizing the legitimate representation of the great Chinese people in the United Nations, in the final analysis, reflects whether each country is sincere and persistent in its attitude towards the principles and fundamental goals of the UN Charter. Therefore, despite the pressure exerted on various delegations to support the United States' arbitrary and illegal actions this time as well, they rarely dare to do so on this platform. How can one verbally say that the United Nations must be universal, while in practice obstructing a large country with a quarter of the world's population from participating in its activities?
	The outstanding achievements of the Chinese people in eliminating the remnants of colonialism, in developing the economy and culture, in defending peace, and in promoting the principles of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation have been widely praised throughout the world. Without the active participation of the People's Republic of China, it has become unimaginable to resolve major international issues.
	Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out: The content and tone of the proposal submitted by the United States to the General Assembly illustrate the nature of this action. When people see this proposal, they have such questions: Is it really a proposal, or is it a notice from an administrative or military agency to its subordinate agencies? Because the US proposal literally and in a commanding tone requires the General Assembly not to even discuss the issue of China's representation. Isn't the US proposal a blatant attempt to seal the mouth of the General Assembly? This is a crudest manifestation of the "position of strength" policy, and it is not only reflected in the relationship with one or another country, but with the United Nations General Assembly itself.
	Gheorghiu-Dej said: What are the basic reasons for those who oppose the solution of the China representation issue to take this position? The answer is simple, clear and universally known: the social system won by the Chinese people through decades of struggle and at the cost of huge bloodshed is not to the liking of the United States. Similarly, American imperialism cannot forget that the victory of the Chinese revolution dealt a very heavy blow to the entire colonial system and inspired the struggle of other oppressed nations for freedom and national independence.
	The enormous and vigorous strength of socialism and its appeal to the people of all countries have aroused extremely deep dissatisfaction among certain groups in the West, and this dissatisfaction has sometimes taken the most violent forms. However, no matter how intense the reaction of those decaying forces, the past and present have proved and will continue to prove that these new social ideas cannot be stopped or pushed back. Everyone knows that the emergence of the socialist system is the result of an irreversible historical process and marks a new and advanced stage in the development of human society.
	Gheorghiu-Dej refuted the slander against China, saying: Those who oppose China's representation in the United Nations often try to justify their intolerable attitude by relying on an outdated slander, saying that this country will become an "unstable" factor in the world. This is a rude disregard for the truth, because everyone knows that it is the United States that has invaded Taiwan and other Chinese islands, and is taking blatant acts of aggression against China. The facts prove that all the armed forces of the People's Republic of China are on their own territory, while the United States sends its maritime and air armed forces equipped with atomic weapons and rockets to places far away from its own territory, occupying a part of China, and fills the areas near China with aggressive military bases targeting the People's Republic of China. Since when does a country that maintains armed forces on its own territory to defend its sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity cause "instability" and be considered "aggressive", while a country that sends armed forces to foreign territories thousands of kilometers away is ensuring "tranquility" and is considered "peaceful"? Suffice it to say that prominent leaders of some Asian countries neighboring the People's Republic of China, such as Indonesian President Sukarno, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk, Afghanistan, Nepal and other national leaders are clearly advocating the recognition of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, and believe that this is necessary to solve major international problems. Isn't it absurd that the Washington government is forcing through a decision in the United Nations that China's Asian neighbors consider unjust and harmful?
	The injustice and fragility of the US position is so obvious that even some of the US allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization reject it and emphasize its bankrupt nature. In this regard, the statement of the Danish Foreign Minister at the United Nations General Assembly is enlightening. He rightly concluded by saying: "Sooner or later, the Chinese people will be represented in this organization by the government that actually exercises power."
	Gheorghiu-Dej exposed the hypocrisy of the US representative, saying: The US representative tried to pretend to be a calm and gentle person here. In view of the shenanigans done by the United States, people cannot but interpret its words from the perspective of the old principle of American foreign policy of "speaking softly but carrying a big stick."
	The reality is that the US position on the People's Republic of China does not demonstrate a desire to negotiate, but demonstrates a tendency to poison relations between countries, an intention to pursue the outdated "position of strength" policy, and an intention to prevent the United Nations from playing its role as a tool to improve international life and provide the necessary conditions for negotiations.
	Gheorghiu-Dej asked: A question arises: is the imperialist group able to impose such a tendency on the United Nations, or will it be able to create conditions so that this organization can act with all its capabilities in accordance with what the people of all countries hope, in order to accelerate the solution of those major problems we face?
	Gheorghiu-Dej concluded by saying that the Romanian delegation requests that the participants in the meeting treat this issue with the utmost seriousness and sense of responsibility, and contribute to the urgent solution of this issue.
	It is for these reasons that the Romanian People's Republic, together with all peace-loving countries, demands that the General Assembly decide to expel the Chiang Kai-shek puppet and restore the legitimate rights of the great Chinese people in the United Nations.

    就中国在联合国的代表权问题
    乔治乌—德治在联大全体会议上发言
    新华社布加勒斯特11日电　罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特7日讯：罗马尼亚出席联合国大会第十五届会议代表团团长乔治乌—德治10月6日在联合国大会上就中国在联合国组织中的代表权问题发表了演说。
    乔治乌—德治说：许多国家在本届联大会议的讲台上发言主张毫不拖延地解决中国在联合国组织中的代表权问题，其数目之多和这一事实本身的意义表明，这个问题对于联合国组织已经变得极端紧要，以致影响到这个组织存在的基础和理由。现在已经很清楚，如何对待承认伟大的中国人民在联合国组织中的合法代表权问题，归根结蒂，反映出每个国家对待联合国宪章的原则和根本目标是否具有诚意和坚持不渝。因此，尽管有人对各国代表团施加压力，要它们这一次也支持美国的蛮横和非法的行动，但是它们却很少敢于在这个讲台上这样做。怎么能够在口头上说联合国组织必须是普遍性的而在实际行动中却阻挠一个拥有占人类四分之一人口的大国参加活动呢？
    中国人民在消灭殖民主义残余方面、在发展经济和文化以及保卫和平方面、在促进和平共处和国际合作的原则方面的出色成就，得到了全世界的广泛的赞扬。没有中华人民共和国的积极参加，要解决重大的国际问题已经成为不可想像的事了。
    乔治乌—德治指出：美国向大会提出的提案的内容和语气都说明了这个行动的性质。人们看到这个提案时有这样的疑问：它到底确实算是一个提案呢，还是一个行政或军事机构对它的附属机构下命令的通告？因为美国的提案在文字上、并且用一种发号施令的语气要求大会甚至不讨论中国的代表权的问题。美国提案难道不是一种想要封住大会之口的明目张胆的企图吗？这是“实力地位”政策的一种最粗鲁的表现，并且不只是表现在同一个或另一个国家的关系中，而是对联合国大会本身。
    乔治乌—德治说：那些反对解决中国代表权问题的人采取这种立场的基本原因何在呢？答案是简单明了和举世皆知的：中国人民经过数十年的斗争、付出了巨大流血牺牲的代价所争取来的社会制度，不合美国的心意。同样地，美帝国主义也忘不了：中国革命的胜利给整个殖民体系一个极沉重的打击，鼓舞了其他被压迫民族争取自由和民族独立的斗争。
    社会主义的巨大的和朝气蓬勃的力量、它对各国人民的吸引力，引起了西方某些集团极其深刻的不满，而这种不满有时采取了最激烈的形式，这已不是什么新闻了。但是不论那些衰朽力量的反应多么激烈，过去和现在都证明、并且将来仍将证明是无法阻挡或推回这些新的社会思想的。大家知道，社会主义体系的出现是一个无法改变的历史过程的结果，并且标志着人类社会发展中的一个新的高级阶段。
    乔治乌—德治驳斥了对中国的诬蔑，他说：那些反对中国在联合国组织中有代表的人试图为他们的这种不能容许的态度辩解，往往依赖一种陈旧不堪的诬蔑，说什么这个国家将成为世界上的一个“不稳”的因素。这是一种粗暴的不顾真实情况的行为，因为人人都知道：正是美国侵略了台湾和其他中国岛屿，并且在对中国采取明目张胆的侵略行动。事实证明：中华人民共和国所有的武装部队都在自己的领土上，而美国却把配备着原子武器和火箭的海上和空中武装部队派到离开自己领土很远的地方去，占领着中国的一部分，并且在中国附近的地区布满了针对中华人民共和国的侵略性军事基地。从什么时候，一个为了保卫自己的主权、独立和领土完整而在它本国领土上保持武装部队的国家引起“不稳”并且被认为是“侵略性的”，而一个把武装部队派到数千公里以外的外国领土上去的国家却是在保证“平静”而且被认为是“和平的”呢？足以说明问题的特点的是，中华人民共和国邻近的一些亚洲国家的著名的领导人，像印度尼西亚总统苏加诺、印度总理尼赫鲁、缅甸总理吴努、柬埔寨王国国家元首西哈努克亲王、阿富汗、尼泊尔和其他国家的国家领导人都在明白地主张承认中国在联合国组织中的合法权利，并且认为这是解决重大国际问题所必要的。华盛顿政府竟然在联合国组织里强行通过一项中国的亚洲邻国认为是不公正的和有害的决定，这岂不是荒唐的吗？
    美国的这种立场的不公正和脆弱是如此明显，就连美国在北大西洋公约组织内的一些盟国也拒绝它，并且强调指出了它已经破产的性质。在这方面，富有启发性的是丹麦外交大臣在联大的发言。他在最后完全有道理地说：“中国人民迟早将由那个实际上行使权力的政府在这个组织里代表他们。”
    乔治乌—德治揭露美国代表的伪善面目说：美国代表试图在这里装做一种讲话平静而态度温和的人。鉴于美国所干的勾当，人们不能不从美国外交政策的“说话温和但手持大棒”这个老原则的角度来解释它的话。
    现实情况是，美国对中华人民共和国的立场不是证明了希望谈判，而是证明了那种要毒化各国间的关系的倾向，那种推行过了时的“实力地位”政策的意图，和阻止联合国组织发挥它作为改善国际生活和为谈判提供必要条件的工具的作用的意图。
    乔治乌—德治问道：产生了这样一个问题：是帝国主义集团能够把这样一种趋向强加在联合国组织身上呢，还是将能够创造条件使这个组织依据各国人民所希望的情况，以其全部能力行动起来，以便加快解决我们所面临的那些重大问题？
    乔治乌—德治最后说，罗马尼亚代表团要求会议参加者们以极其认真的态度和责任心来看待这个问题，并且为这个问题的迫切需要的解决贡献出力量。
    就是由于这些理由，罗马尼亚人民共和国同所有爱好和平的国家一起要求大会决定把蒋介石傀儡开除出去以及恢复伟大的中国人民在联合国组织中的合法权利。
