Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 29th. The Lao Fighting Forces Radio Station published a commentary on the 27th, calling on the Lao people to resolutely crush all conspiracies to distort the policy of peaceful neutrality.

The commentary pointed out that the policy of peaceful neutrality is a policy for which the Lao people have struggled for many years, a policy to free Laos from the control and shackles of US imperialism and to build a new Laos that is independent, unified, democratic and prosperous. However, US imperialism and its running dogs, the Phoumi Nosavan reactionary clique and foreign reactionaries, such as the reactionaries of Thailand and South Vietnam, hate this policy. US imperialism and its vassal states have always been scheming to turn Laos into a US colony and military base.

The commentary then pointed out that in the face of the rising anti-American patriotic struggle movement of the Lao people to realize the policy of peaceful neutrality, US imperialism is also attempting to deceive the people by proposing a fake policy of peaceful neutrality through its running dogs. For example, the former Phoumi Nosavan-Somsanith clique, under the guise of a fake policy of peaceful neutrality, created civil war, brutally carried out "sweeps," and persecuted the people. As a result, they were thoroughly defeated by the people.

The commentary said that now, some people, such as Van Prajhakone (Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Lao Army), a friend of Phoumi Nosavan, have put forward something called the "Van Prajhakone-style" "peaceful neutrality." It emphasized that this "peaceful neutrality" policy is different from the Lao government's policy of peaceful neutrality. The Lao government's policy of peaceful neutrality advocates establishing relations with countries in both camps and accepting aid from the socialist camp in order to break free from the threats of US imperialism and the control and shackles of its vassal states that have always plagued the fate of Laos. Van Prajhakone's "peaceful neutrality," on the other hand, is to submit to the United States and oppose the Lao Fighting Forces and patriotic and peace-loving forces. The commentary said that this fake "peaceful neutrality" policy cannot deceive anyone.

The commentary concluded that to achieve genuine peaceful neutrality, it is necessary to unite all forces that love the motherland and love peace, support and promote the government to firmly follow the path of peaceful neutrality, and at the same time, concentrate all forces to crush the interference of US imperialism and the traitorous activities of Phoumi Nosavan.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 28th. According to Vientiane Radio, Lao Kingdom Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma reaffirmed on the 27th that Laos will pursue a neutral policy.

Speaking at a banquet in honor of Soviet Ambassador to Laos, Abramov, Prime Minister Phouma said that the Lao people were pleased to see the establishment of friendly relations between Laos and the Soviet Union. He said that the only policy that would enable Laos to survive was a thorough policy of neutrality. "Laos cannot lean to one side or the other."

According to Phnom Penh Radio, Prime Minister Phouma said at a press conference in Vientiane on the 27th that he had indicated in principle that he would accept Soviet aid when he met with Soviet Ambassador to Laos, Abramov, that day.

Phouma also said, "The United States will continue to aid Laos as before." He said that in a few days, the United States would give the Lao Ministry of Finance a check. US aid "includes economic and military assistance."

    斥美国用假“和平中立”欺骗老挝人民
    富马首相重申奉行中立政策表示在原则上接受苏联援助
    新华社河内29日电　寮国战斗部队电台27日发表评论，号召老挝人民坚决粉碎歪曲和平中立政策的一切阴谋。
    评论指出，和平中立政策是老挝人民多年来为之斗争的政策，是使老挝摆脱美帝国主义的控制、束缚，建设一个独立、统一、民主和繁荣的新老挝的政策。但是美帝国主义及其走狗富米·诺萨万反动集团和外国反动派，如泰国、南越的反动派仇恨这种政策。美帝国主义及其仆从国向来就处心积虑地要把老挝变成美国的殖民地和军事基地。
    评论接着指出，在老挝人民为实现和平中立政策而进行的反美救国斗争运动日益高涨的情况下，美帝国主义也企图通过它的走狗提出假的和平中立政策来欺骗人民。如过去的富米·诺萨万—松萨尼特集团，就曾经在假的和平中立的政策的招牌下，制造内战，残暴地进行“扫荡”，迫害人民。结果，受到人民的彻底的打击。
    评论说，现在，又有一些人，如富米·诺萨万的朋友万·拉迪功（老挝王国军队总司令），又提出了什么“万·拉迪功式”的“和平中立”。它着重指出，这种“和平中立”政策是和老挝政府的和平中立政策不同的。老挝政府的和平中立政策，主张同两个阵营的国家建立关系，接受社会主义阵营的援助，以摆脱使老挝的命运一向受到美帝国主义的威胁和它的仆从国的控制和束缚。万·拉迪功的“和平中立”则是屈从美国、反对寮国战斗部队和爱祖国爱和平的力量的。评论说，这种假的“和平中立”政策是欺骗不了任何人的。
    评论最后说，要实现真正的和平中立，就必须团结爱祖国、爱和平的一切力量，支持和促进政府坚决遵循和平中立道路，同时，集中一切力量粉碎美帝国主义的干涉和富米·诺萨万的卖国活动。
    新华社河内28日电　据万象电台广播，老挝王国首相梭发那·富马27日重申老挝将奉行中立政策。
    富马首相在招待苏联驻老挝大使阿布拉莫夫的宴会上讲话时说，老挝人民高兴地看到老挝和苏联之间建立了友好关系。他说，使老挝能够生存的唯一政策是彻底的中立政策。“老挝不能倒向这一边或那一边”。
    另据金边电台广播，富马首相27日在万象举行的记者招待会上说，他在当天接见苏联驻老挝大使阿布拉莫夫时，已经在原则上表示将接受苏联的援助。
    富马同时说，“美国将仍然照旧援助老挝。”他说，再过几天，美国将给老挝财政部一张支票。美国的援款“包括经济和军事援助。”
