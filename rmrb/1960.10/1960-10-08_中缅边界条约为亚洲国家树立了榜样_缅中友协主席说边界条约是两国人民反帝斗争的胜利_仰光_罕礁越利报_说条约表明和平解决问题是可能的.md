Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, October 6th. Xin Bo, Chairman of the Myanmar-China Friendship Association, published an article warmly hailing the signing of the China-Myanmar Border Treaty. He said that this is a victory for the anti-imperialist struggle of the two peoples and sets an example for friendly coexistence between Asian countries.

The article, published in several Myanmar newspapers, reviewed the history of imperialist countries enslaving Asian countries, pointing out that after the end of World War II, American imperialism "constituted a new imperialist group in the world as ferocious as a devil."

The article said that they interfered in the internal affairs of independent countries, making their independence unstable. For example, shortly after the independence of the Congo, the imperialists supported lackeys and carried out interference in the Congo. Similarly, although some Asian countries have been independent for more than a decade, they have not yet achieved the development they deserve. Their economies are still unable to break free from dependence on Western capitalists.

The article emphasized, "In order to pave the way for interference, imperialists deliberately created conditions to cause long-term discord between Asian countries. Imperialists also used unresolved border issues as a tool to incite hatred between the People's China and other Asian countries. They especially tried their best to make the border issue a problem that could never be resolved between the two countries."

The article said that the vicious conspiracy of imperialism against China and Myanmar has vanished like water poured on sand. The signing of the China-Myanmar Border Treaty is a victory for the anti-imperialist struggle of the Chinese and Myanmar peoples and proves to the world that existing problems between countries can be resolved amicably in accordance with the Five Principles of Bandung.

The article concluded, "The China-Myanmar Border Treaty is one of the events of particularly great significance to world peace."

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, October 6th. The Rangoon "Han Jiao Yue Li Bao" published an editorial today, warmly praising the signing of the China-Myanmar Border Treaty. The newspaper said: "We are very happy that Myanmar and China can set an example to the world by showing, through mutual concession and sincerity, that peaceful resolution of problems is possible in such a turbulent world situation."

The newspaper also expressed its gratitude to all parties concerned for their efforts in the successful signing of the China-Myanmar Border Treaty.

    中缅边界条约为亚洲国家树立了榜样
    缅中友协主席说边界条约是两国人民反帝斗争的胜利
    仰光“罕礁越利报”说条约表明和平解决问题是可能的
    新华社仰光6日电　缅中友好协会主席信波发表文章，热情欢呼中缅边界条约的签订。他说，这是两国人民反对帝国主义斗争的胜利，并为亚洲国家之间友好相处树立了榜样。
    缅甸几家报纸刊登的这篇文章，在回顾了帝国主义国家奴役亚洲国家的历史后指出，第二次世界大战结束以后，美帝国主义“在世界上构成一个像魔鬼一样凶恶的新的帝国主义集团”。
    文章说，他们干涉独立国家的内政，使它们的独立不能稳定。例如刚果独立后不久，帝国主义者就在刚果扶植走狗和进行干涉。同样，虽然有些亚洲国家到现在已经独立了十几年，但是它们还没有得到它们应有的发展。它们的经济仍然不能摆脱对西方资本家的依赖。
    文章强调指出，“帝国主义者为了铺平进行干涉的道路，他们故意制造条件来引起亚洲国家之间的长期不和。帝国主义者还利用悬而未决的边界问题，作为激起人民中国和其他亚洲国家之间仇恨的工具。他们特别竭力使边界问题成为两国间永远得不到解决的问题。”
    文章说，但是帝国主义这种对中国和缅甸的恶毒阴谋已经化为泡影，就像泼到沙上的水一样。中缅边界条约的签字是中缅两国人民反帝斗争的胜利，并向全世界证明，各国间现有的问题是能够按照万隆精神的五项原则得到友好解决的。
    文章最后说，“中缅边界条约是对世界和平具有特别重大意义的事件之一。”
    据新华社仰光6日电　仰光“罕礁越利报”今天发表社论，热烈赞扬中缅边界条约的签订。报纸说：“我们非常高兴，缅甸和中国能通过互让和诚意，作为榜样向全世界表明：在世界如此动荡不安的局势中和平解决问题是可能的。”
    报纸还对为中缅边界条约胜利签订作出努力的各有关方面表示感激。
