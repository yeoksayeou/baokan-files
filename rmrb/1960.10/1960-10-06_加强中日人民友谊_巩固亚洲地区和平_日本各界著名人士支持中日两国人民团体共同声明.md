Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 5th: Prominent figures from various circles in Japan today expressed their heartfelt support for the joint statement issued in Beijing on the 3rd by the visiting delegations of eight Chinese people's organizations and twelve Japanese organizations.

    Matsushima Harushige, a member of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Japanese Communist Party, expressed his support for the joint statement in a statement to Japanese reporters. He said, "We are striving to achieve the goals listed in the statement through the close cooperation of all democratic forces."

    Tanaka Toshio, Chairman of the National Movement Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party, said that the joint statement is a fruit born on the land of fighting friendship, tempered by the common struggle of the Japanese and Chinese people against the conclusion of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    He said that the joint statement clearly points out the path to establishing a consolidated peace in Asia. Tanaka said, "Only by driving U.S. imperialism out of our continent will a consolidated peace in Asia become possible for the people of our Asian countries."

    Tanaka emphasized that if we further strengthen the fighting friendship between the two peoples, we will victoriously achieve our goals.

    Kazami Akira, Chairman of the Japan National Council for the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations with China, said that the joint statement is a very good document that points out the path for the Japanese people to abolish the new "Security Treaty." He pointed out that the spirit of international solidarity overflowing in this document is especially important. The joint statement will have a huge positive impact on their future struggles for peace, independence, and democracy.

    Mizuguchi Hirozo, Secretary-General of the "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," said that the Japanese people must wage an irreconcilable struggle against the Ikeda Cabinet's policy of strengthening the "Security Treaty system," and embody the spirit of unity that is the basis of the joint statement in their own actions.

    日本各界著名人士支持中日两国人民团体共同声明
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本各界著名人士今天表示衷心支持中国八个人民团体和日本十二个团体的访华代表团3日在北京发表的共同声明。
    日本共产党中央干部会委员松岛治重向日本记者发表谈话表示支持共同声明。他说：“我们在一切民主力量的紧密合作下，正在为达到声明中所列举的目标而奋斗”。
    日本社会党国民运动委员会委员长田中稔男说，共同声明是经过日本和中国人民反对缔结新日美“安全条约”的共同斗争的锻炼，在战斗的友谊的土地上结出的果实。
    他说，共同声明明确地指出在亚洲建立巩固的和平的道路。田中说：“我们亚洲各国人民只有把美帝国主义赶出我们的大陆，在亚洲的巩固和平才会成为可能”。
    田中着重指出，如果我们进一步加强两国人民的战斗友谊，我们将胜利地达到我们的目标。
    日本恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章说，共同声明是一个很好地向日本人民指出废除新“安全条约”的道路的文件。他指出，洋溢在这个文件中的国际团结的精神尤其重要。共同声明将对他们今后争取和平、独立和民主的斗争发生巨大的积极影响。
    “阻止修改安全条约国民会议”事务局长水口宏三说，日本人民必须对池田内阁加强“安全条约体系”的政策进行不调和的斗争，在自己的行动中体现出作为共同声明基础的团结精神。
