Xinhua News Agency report: Panyu County, Guangdong Province, in accordance with the spirit of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, is using its greatest strength to strengthen support for and leadership in the Shatian area, a key grain production area, in order to fully utilize the role of these areas as grain production bases.

Panyu County is located in the Pearl River Delta plain. Seven of the county's fourteen communes are large Shatian areas formed by the Pearl River estuary's alluvial deposits. These seven communes account for only about 40% of the county's farming households, but their cultivated land accounts for 63% of the county's total, and their grain output accounts for about 75% of the county's total. The land here is fertile, with great potential for increased production; however, there is a relative shortage of labor and livestock. On average, each laborer has to cultivate ten to thirteen mu of rice paddy, nearly twice as much as the county average of six point six mu per laborer. Each head of cattle has to cultivate seventy mu of land, with some cultivating as much as one hundred and fifty mu. Therefore, the county committee believes that vigorously strengthening support for and leadership in the Shatian area in terms of manpower and resources is of extremely important significance for the development of grain production in the entire county.

"Increasing Troops and Sending Generals" is Panyu County's first measure to strengthen the Shatian area. Currently, the county committee has dispatched three county party secretaries and three members of the standing committee to reside permanently in the Shatian area, and has also transferred three hundred and sixty-eight cadres from county-level organs to serve as deputy secretaries or deputy captains in the brigades and production teams of the Shatian area's communes. The labor force freed up from various sectors to strengthen agriculture is also mainly reinforcing the Shatian area. To date, adding in the labor force strengthened to the front lines after the communes themselves adjusted their labor organization, the agricultural labor force in the seven communes has increased by an average of 11%. In order to solve the problem of insufficient livestock, seventy-one of the county's existing ninety-two tractors (mixed type) have been transferred to the Shatian area for centralized use, and a large number of draft cattle have been purchased from various producing areas. One thousand head of cattle have already been purchased.

Accelerating agricultural technological transformation is the fundamental measure to solve the labor shortage in the Shatian area. To this end, the county committee has decided to make the Shatian area the focus of industrial support for agriculture, and, based on the characteristics of the Shatian area, has made plans to vigorously support the Shatian area in terms of cultivation, fertilizer accumulation, transportation, and drainage and irrigation. First, vigorously promote rice transplanters and rapid harvesters. This year, the area planted by machine for the late crop has reached more than 100,000 mu. Among them, the "Panyu No. 1" and "Panyu No. 2" simple rice transplanters have been continuously improved and have reached the requirements for standardized promotion. At present, the county has concentrated more than 100 excellent carpenters to be permanently responsible for manufacturing, and has trained ironworkers and carpenters in the communes in the manufacture and repair of rice transplanters. Second, gradually realize the mechanization of fertilizer accumulation. Based on the characteristic that river silt is the largest source of fertilizer in the Shatian area, the Panyu Shipyard has recently successfully trial-produced a motorized mud dredger, which is more than ten times more efficient than ordinary mud dredgers. This type of mud dredger has been put into production. Eight have already been built, and production is continuing. Third, vigorously grasp the repair and construction of boats. In the Shatian area, where rivers crisscross, boats are the main means of transportation. At present, in addition to allocating a batch of timber to the Shatian area for boat repair, the county has also sent labor to the mountains to cut and rush timber for the construction of more boats. Fourth, build electric drainage and irrigation stations to eliminate the most serious threat to the Shatian area—internal flooding—and ensure stable production. At present, electric drainage and irrigation stations are all under construction according to plan, and the construction of power transmission projects is being stepped up.

The Panyu County Committee also gives special consideration to the Shatian area in terms of improved varieties, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, allocating 70% of the technical force of the agricultural sector to the Shatian area to strengthen technical guidance. This series of measures has promoted the development of the excellent production situation in the Shatian area in all aspects. First of all, it has greatly encouraged the commune members and cadres in the Shatian area. Because the labor force has been strengthened, many brigades have tried every means to tap the potential of the land and expand the planting area as much as possible. The Lixin Brigade of the Wanqingsha Commune had a Tong'an dike of one hundred and forty mu, which was often flooded due to the collapse of the dike foundation and had been abandoned as early as before liberation. Recently, the party branch secretary and the brigade leader of this brigade led the commune members to repair the abandoned dike and planted all of it with late rice. At present, all seven Shatian communes in the county are vigorously accumulating fertilizer to win a bumper harvest of late rice and prepare for winter planting. Communes such as Wanqingsha, Huangge, Lanhe, and Dagang have dispatched large and small boats to the Inner Lingdingyang in the Pearl River Estuary to dredge white clams for fertilizer. Communes such as Yuzhutou, Lingshan, and Shilou have sent ships to Guangzhou to transport garbage and manure. The communes in the Shatian area, which have never had a large-scale winter planting habit, are also treating winter planting as a crop this year, and have prepared all the seeds for winter-planted coarse grains and oil crops.

    番禺县大力加强沙田地区领导
    让粮食生产基地充分发挥作用
    当地各公社为晚稻多收和种好冬麦正大积肥料
    据新华社讯　广东省番禺县根据大办农业、大办粮食的精神，用最大的力量加强粮食生产重点地区——沙田地区的支援和领导，以充分发挥这些地区作为粮食生产基地的作用。
    番禺县位于珠江三角洲平原，全县十四个公社中有七个公社是珠江口冲积而成的大沙田地区。这七个公社的农户只占全县农户的40％左右，耕地却占全县的63％，特别是粮食产量约占全县的75％。这里土地肥沃，增产潜力很大；但是劳动力和畜力却比较少，平均每个劳动力要负担十亩到十三亩稻田的耕作，比全县平均每个劳动力负担六点六亩将近多一倍，每头牛要负担耕地七十亩，多的达到一百五十多亩。因此县委认为，从人力物力上大力加强对沙田地区的支援和领导，对于全县粮食生产的发展，具有极其重大的意义。
    “增兵遣将”是番禺县加强沙田地区的第一项措施。现在，县委已派出三个县委书记和三个县委常委长驻沙田地区，并且从县级机关下放了三百六十八名干部到沙田地区各公社的大队和生产队当副书记或副队长。各方面腾出来的加强农业的劳动力，也主要增援沙田地区。到目前止，加上公社本身调整劳动组织后加强到第一线去的劳动力，七个公社的农业劳动力平均增加了11％。为了解决畜力不足的问题，全县现有的九十二台拖拉机（混合台）已抽调七十一台集中到沙田地区使用，并且从各个产区大量采购耕牛，现在已经采购回来一千头。
    加速农业技术改造，是解决沙田地区劳动力不足的根本措施。为此，县委决定把沙田地区作为工业对农业支援的重点，并根据沙田地区的特点，作出了从耕作、积肥、运输、排灌等方面大力支援沙田地区的规划。第一，大力推广插秧机和快速收割器。今年晚造，全县机插面积已经达到十万多亩，其中“番禺一号”和“番禺二号”两种简易插秧机经过不断改进，已经达到定型推广的要求。目前，全县集中了一百多个优秀的木工固定负责制造，并且对各公社的铁、木工进行制造和修理插秧机的训练。第二，逐步实现积肥机械化。根据沙泥是沙田地区最大量的肥源这一特点，番禺造船厂最近已经试制成功一种机动挖泥船，工效比一般的挖泥船提高十多倍。这种挖泥船已经投入生产，现在已经造好了八艘，并仍继续制造中。第三，大抓船艇的修造。在河网纵横的沙田地区，船艇是主要的运输工具。目前，县里除已拨出一批木材给沙田地区修艇外，又派出了劳力到山区砍伐和抢运木材，增造船艇。第四，兴建电动排灌站以消除沙田地区最主要的威胁——内涝，保障生产的稳定。目前，电动排灌站都已经按计划施工，并且正在加紧输电工程的建设。
    番禺县委还在良种、化肥、农药等方面给沙田地区以特别的照顾，把农业部门技术力量的70％投放到沙田区，以加强技术指导。这一系列的措施已经从各方面促进了沙田地区大好生产形势的发展。首先是大大鼓舞了沙田地区的社员和干部。许多大队由于劳动力加强了，便千方百计挖掘土地潜力，尽力扩种。万顷沙公社沥心大队有个一百四十亩的同安围，因堤基崩烂，常受水浸，早在解放前就已丢荒。最近，这个大队的党总支书记和大队长带领社员抢修好了这个荒围，全部插上了晚稻。目前，全县七个沙田公社都为夺取晚造多收和准备冬种大量积肥。万顷沙、黄阁、榄核、大岗等公社，都已出动大船和小艇到珠江口外的内伶仃洋捞挖白蚬作肥料。鱼涡头、灵山、石楼等公社已派船到广州运垃圾和粪肥。历来无大面积冬种习惯的沙田区公社，今年也把冬种当作一造来抓，冬种的杂粮、油料等种籽都已备齐。
