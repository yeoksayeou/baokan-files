Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from New York: U.S. President Eisenhower, Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy, Undersecretary of State Dillon and other leading figures of the U.S. ruling clique have successively clamored that the U.S. is determined to "do its utmost" to subvert the people's regimes of socialist countries.

Eisenhower, at the "American Polish Congress" held in Chicago on September 30, reiterated the sinister policy he put forward in 1952 of plotting to subvert the socialist camp. He clamored that the U.S. government would still "do its utmost" to use "peaceful means" to give those in the so-called "dictatorial regimes the right to decide their own destiny through free elections."

Kennedy, at the same meeting on the 1st, had to admit that the U.S. Republican government's policy of "liberating Eastern Europe" had failed. But he clamored for a more insidious policy of so-called encouraging "peaceful evolution" to subvert socialist countries. Kennedy openly advocated that the next U.S. government must take measures to encourage "splits within the communist camp," and take so-called "economic assistance, cultural exchanges" and other methods to infiltrate the socialist camp, in order to implement a "policy of patiently encouraging freedom and carefully suppressing tyranny, focusing on evolution rather than revolution."

Undersecretary of State Dillon also delivered a lengthy Cold War speech at the "American Polish Congress" banquet on the 2nd. Dillon stated that the U.S. "will never accept the current situation in Eastern Europe, but only regard it as a nightmare before the dawn of freedom that is bound to come." He blatantly opposed peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. He slandered peaceful coexistence as merely a "slogan" used by "Soviet imperialism" in the twentieth century to "conquer the world" through "economic pressure, political infiltration and domestic unrest."

    艾森豪威尔和肯尼迪公然叫嚣
    美国要颠复社会主义国家
    狄龙露骨表示美国反对和平共处
    新华社4日讯　纽约消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔、美国民主党总统候选人肯尼迪和美国副国务卿狄龙等美国统治集团的首脑人物，相继叫嚣美国决心“竭尽全力”颠复社会主义国家的人民政权。
    艾森豪威尔9月30日在芝加哥举行的“美国籍波兰人大会”上重申，他在1952年提出的阴谋颠复社会主义阵营的罪恶政策。他叫嚷说，美国政府仍将“竭尽全力”用“和平手段”使处在所谓“独裁政权束缚下的人们有权利通过自由选举决定他们自己的命运”。
    肯尼迪1日在同一会议上不得不承认美国共和党政府“解放东欧”的政策已经失败。但是他叫嚷要采取更阴险的所谓鼓励“和平演变”的政策来颠复社会主义国家。肯尼迪公开鼓吹说，下届美国政府必须采取措施鼓励“共产主义阵营内的分裂”，采取所谓“经济援助、文化交流”等方式对社会主义阵营进行渗透，以执行一种“耐心地鼓励自由和小心地压制暴政、着眼于演变而不是着眼于革命的政策”。
    美国副国务卿狄龙2日在“美国籍波兰人大会”的宴会上也发表长篇的冷战演说。狄龙表示，美国“将永不接受目前在东欧的局势，而只把它看作必将降临的自由黎明前的恶梦”。他露骨地反对社会制度不同的国家和平共处。他诬蔑和平共处只是二十世纪“苏联帝国主义”使用“经济压力、政治渗透和国内骚乱”来“征服世界”的“口号”。
