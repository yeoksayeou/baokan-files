Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th. Marshal He Long, head of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council of China, and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a speech tonight at the Pyongyang report meeting commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering Korea to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The full text of the speech is as follows:

    Dear Comrades and Friends:
    The Military Friendship Delegation of the People’s Republic of China is very pleased to have the opportunity to meet the heroic people of Pyongyang today and to participate in the grand gathering of the people of Pyongyang commemorating "October 25th." Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to express our sincere gratitude and high respect to you, and through you, to all the heroic Korean people and our close comrades-in-arms—the Korean People's Army.
    In June 1950, U.S. imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea and forcibly occupied our sacred territory of Taiwan. Then, disregarding the repeated warnings of the Chinese and Korean governments and suggestions for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, U.S. imperialism brazenly gathered the armies of its vassal states and crossed the 38th parallel on a large scale, extending the flames of war to the Chinese Northeast border. Furthermore, it dispatched invading Korean air forces to bomb Chinese Northeast cities and towns, slaughtering Chinese people. The aggressors were confident that the Chinese and Korean people could be intimidated by their bloody atrocities, thereby realizing their dream of annexing Korea, invading China, and dominating the world. However, like all reactionaries, the U.S. aggressors overestimated their own strength and underestimated the strength of the people. The result was that they lifted a rock only to drop it on their own feet. After the joint struggle of the Chinese and Korean people, the aggressors finally suffered a disastrous defeat and were forced to sign the armistice agreement in surrender. The paper tiger was punctured, and the myth of the invincibility of U.S. imperialism was shattered. The heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army have made immortal contributions in this great struggle. Your valiant battles not only extinguished the flames of the war of aggression against Korea ignited by U.S. imperialism, protected the security of the socialist camp, and saved world peace, but also greatly inspired the firm confidence of the people of the world in opposing U.S. imperialist aggression, striving for national independence and democratic freedom, and defending world peace.
    Since the Korean armistice, the Korean people have continued to wage unremitting struggles to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has put forward a series of proposals for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and has taken many positive measures. The Chinese government and people have always fully supported the peaceful initiatives of the Korean government and have repeatedly taken practical actions to contribute to easing tensions in the Far East and promoting a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea two years ago in response to the peaceful initiatives of the Chinese and Korean governments is the most powerful proof. However, the U.S. aggressors, stubbornly insisting on being enemies of the Chinese and Korean people, have never ceased their evil activities of sabotaging the armistice agreement, deliberately obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, and exacerbating tensions in the Far East. Facts have proven that the nature of U.S. imperialism will not change. Only because the Chinese and Korean people, with the support of the people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the people of the world, have waged a tit-for-tat struggle against the U.S. aggressors, has the U.S. aggressors' plot to reignite the flames of war in Korea failed.
    Over the past decade, the Chinese and Korean people have further developed our deep friendship and great internationalist unity in the common struggle. This friendship and unity are unbreakable because it was forged with blood by the people of our two countries in the long-term struggle against a common enemy; it is based on the principles of proletarian internationalism and the ideological foundation of Marxism-Leninism.
    Our two countries are neighboring countries as closely related as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. In the struggle against imperialist aggression and oppression, the people of the two countries have always shared the same boat through storm and stress. In the arduous years of the Chinese people's domestic revolutionary war and the War of Resistance Against Japan, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people aided us with their blood. During the war of jointly resisting U.S. imperialist aggression, the fraternal unity of the people of the two countries was further developed. Whether in the days of war or in the struggle to defend the armistice agreement, the spirit of sharing life and death, sharing adversity, and sharing the same hatred of the enemy has always permeated the people and armies of our two countries. The Chinese people will forever remember the lofty internationalist friendship of the Korean people towards the Chinese People's Volunteers. The glorious image of the heroic mother An Ok-hee and the internationalist fighter Park Jae-geun will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese people. In recent years, our two peoples have supported and assisted each other in the cause of socialist construction, further developing fraternal relations of unity and cooperation. Marxism-Leninism teaches us that mutual support and mutual assistance are the basic principles of proletarian internationalism. The revolutionary cause led by the proletariat in any country is inseparable from the international obligations of the proletariat. Common interests and common ideals link our destinies as one; and the invincible Marxism-Leninism guarantees that the unity between us is as solid as a rock. The friendship and unity of the people of our two countries, the friendship and unity of the people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, are an important guarantee for our victory. The people of China and Korea and the people of the socialist countries know how to safeguard this friendship and unity. The vain attempts of imperialism and modern revisionists to undermine this friendship and unity will never be realized.
    We are particularly pleased to see that our close comrades-in-arms—the heroic Korean people, under the strong leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, are riding the Chollima and continuously galloping forward along the path of socialist construction, achieving brilliant achievements in the short few years after the armistice. The inhumane destruction carried out by the U.S. aggressors during the war brought unimaginable difficulties to the Korean people. However, the heroic Korean people cannot be intimidated by any difficulties. Relying on your selfless labor, you have not only quickly healed the wounds of war, but have also built your motherland more beautifully on almost a heap of ruins. After completing the industrial output value plan of the first five-year plan two and a half years ahead of schedule, you are already preparing to implement a new seven-year plan that will make the Democratic People's Republic of Korea more prosperous and strong. All these great achievements of the Korean people are not only greatly conducive to the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, but also strengthen the power of the socialist camp.
    Like the Korean people galloping on the Chollima, accelerating towards socialism, our people, holding high the three red banners of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, after the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, have achieved new achievements in socialist construction this year; the upsurge of striving for sustained and comprehensive leaps forward in the development of the national economy in the future is sweeping the country. The Chinese people have full confidence that, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, we will build our country into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in not too long a period of time. Imperialists, reactionaries, and modern revisionists have a deep-seated jealousy of our country's construction achievements. However, no matter how they viciously attack our country, they cannot stop us from moving victoriously towards our great goals.
    Dear Comrades and Friends! We are now facing an unprecedentedly favorable international situation. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong, the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging, the revolutionary struggles of the people in capitalist countries are further developing, and the movement of the people of all countries to defend world peace is becoming increasingly widespread and deep. Since the beginning of this year, the people in many Asian countries and regions such as Japan, South Korea, Turkey, South Vietnam, and Laos have successively launched anti-American storms; the colonial system of imperialism in Africa is facing the danger of complete collapse; in Latin America, the heroic Cuban people have won great victories in their struggle against U.S. imperialism.
    Our government has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy; consistently strived to ease international tensions and achieve peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems; and consistently supported the Soviet Union and other socialist countries' peace initiatives regarding universal disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons. Although U.S. imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan, we still advocate resolving disputes between the two countries through negotiations. Since the beginning of this year, our government has successively signed treaties of friendship and non-aggression or peaceful friendship treaties with many Asian and African countries. Not long ago, we also signed a border treaty with the Burmese government. Our government has repeatedly proposed that Asian and Pacific coastal countries, including the United States, sign a non-aggression peace pact to make this region a nuclear-free zone. However, U.S. imperialism stubbornly adheres to its policy of hostility towards the socialist camp, refuses peaceful coexistence; insists on neo-colonialism, wants to continue plundering and enslaving the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America; insists on expanding armaments and preparing for war, and refuses disarmament. Of course, no matter how vicious imperialism is, it cannot stop the wheels of history from leaping forward. As long as we maintain the necessary vigilance against imperialism, resolutely rely on the peace-loving people of the world, form the broadest united front, and wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism, then the U.S. imperialist policies of aggression and war can be completely crushed. The U.S. aggressors will sooner or later get out of South Korea, from our territory of Taiwan, and from the territories of other countries they occupy. Taiwan, which is occupied by the United States, must return to the embrace of the Chinese people; the 30 million compatriots in North and South Korea, who are artificially divided, must be reunited. The cause of the people of all countries in striving for world peace, national independence, democratic freedom, and socialism will surely continue to achieve new and greater victories.
    Dear Comrades and Friends! As I am about to conclude my speech, please allow me to once again thank the Korean people for their deep friendship with the Chinese people. And please allow me to take this opportunity to convey the memories and gratitude of all the volunteer officers and soldiers who participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to the heroic people of Pyongyang and all the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army.
    Long live the unbreakable internationalist solidarity of the Chinese and Korean people and their armies!
    Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live the great unity of the people of the world!
    Long live world peace!

    贺龙在平壤群众大会上讲话指出
    朝中人民的胜利戳穿了纸老虎
    同生死、共患难、同仇敌忾的精神，始终洋溢在两国的军民之间依靠人民，结成广泛统一战线，就能粉碎美帝国主义的侵略政策
    新华社平壤24日电　中国访朝军事友好代表团团长、中国国防委员会副主席、国务院副总理贺龙元帅，今天晚上在平壤举行的纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝入朝参战十周年报告大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    中华人民共和国军事友好代表团，今天能有机会和英雄的平壤人民见面，并且参加平壤人民纪念“十·二五”的盛大集会，我们感到十分高兴。请允许我代表中国人民和中国人民解放军，向你们并且通过你们向全体英雄的朝鲜人民和我们的亲密战友——朝鲜人民军，表示诚挚的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    1950年6月，美帝国主义发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，并且武装霸占了我国的神圣领土台湾。接着，美帝国主义又不顾朝中两国政府的一再警告和关于和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，悍然纠集其仆从国家的军队，大举越过三八线，把战火延烧到中国东北边境，并且派遣侵朝空军轰炸中国的东北城乡，屠杀中国人民。侵略者满以为朝中人民可以被他们的血腥暴行所吓倒，从而实现其吞并朝鲜、侵占中国、称霸世界的迷梦。但是，同一切反动派一样，美国侵略者过高估计了自己的力量，过低估计了人民的力量，结果是搬起石头打了自己的脚。经过朝中人民的并肩奋战，终于使侵略者遭受了惨重的失败，最后不得不在停战协定上签字认输。纸老虎被戳穿了，美帝国主义不可战胜的神话破灭了。英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，在这一场伟大的斗争中，立下了不朽的功勋。你们以自己英勇的战斗，不仅扑灭了美帝国主义燃起的侵朝战火，保卫了社会主义阵营的安全，拯救了世界和平，而且大大鼓舞了全世界人民反对美帝国主义侵略、争取民族独立和民主自由、保卫世界和平的坚强信心。
    朝鲜停战以后，朝鲜人民为了谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，继续进行了坚持不懈的斗争。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国提出了一系列和平统一祖国的建议，并且采取了许多积极的措施。中国政府和人民，一贯全力支持朝鲜政府的和平倡议，并且一再以自己的实际行动，对和缓远东紧张局势和促进朝鲜问题的和平解决作出贡献。两年前，中国人民志愿军响应朝中两国政府的和平倡议，全部撤离朝鲜，就是最有力的证明。但是，顽固地坚持与朝中人民为敌的美国侵略者，却从未间断过其破坏停战协定、蓄意阻挠朝鲜和平统一、加剧远东紧张局势的罪恶活动。事实证明，美帝国主义的本性是不会改变的。只是由于朝中人民在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界人民的支持下，同美国侵略者进行了针锋相对的斗争，美国侵略者重新在朝鲜点燃战火的阴谋才没有得逞。
    十年来，中朝两国人民在共同斗争中，进一步发展了我们之间的深厚友谊和伟大的国际主义团结。这种友谊和团结是牢不可破的，因为它是我们两国人民在反对共同敌人的长期斗争中用鲜血凝结而成的；是建立在无产阶级国际主义的原则和马克思列宁主义思想基础之上的。
    我们两国是唇齿相依、休戚与共的邻邦。两国人民在反对帝国主义的侵略和压迫的斗争中，从来是风雨同舟、祸福与共的。早在中国人民进行国内革命战争及抗日战争的艰苦岁月里，朝鲜人民的优秀儿女，就以鲜血援助了我们。在并肩抗击美帝国主义侵略的战争中，两国人民兄弟般的团结，得到了进一步的发展。无论在战争的日子里，还是在捍卫停战协定的斗争中，同生死，共患难，同仇敌忾的精神，始终洋溢在我们两国人民和两国军队之间。朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军的崇高的国际主义友情，中国人民是永远感念不忘的。英雄的母亲安玉姬、国际主义战士朴在根的光辉形象，永远活在中国人民的心中。近几年来，我们两国人民在社会主义建设事业中，互相支持，互相援助，进一步发展了团结合作的兄弟关系。马克思列宁主义教导我们，相互支持和相互援助，是无产阶级国际主义的基本原则。任何一个国家无产阶级领导的革命事业，同无产阶级的国际义务是不可分离的。共同的利益和共同的理想，把我们的命运联系得如同一体；战无不胜的马克思列宁主义，则保证了我们之间的团结坚如磐石。我们两国人民的友谊和团结，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民的友谊和团结，是我们取得胜利的重要保证。中朝两国人民、社会主义各国人民是懂得怎样来维护这种友谊和团结的。帝国主义和现代修正主义者要破坏这种友谊和团结的痴心妄想，是永远不会实现的。
    我们特别高兴地看到，我们的亲密战友——英雄的朝鲜人民，在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的坚强领导下，在停战后的短短几年中，跨着千里马，沿着社会主义建设大道不断飞驰前进，取得了辉煌的成就。美国侵略者在战争期间进行的灭绝人性的破坏，曾给朝鲜人民带来了难以想像的困难。但是，英雄的朝鲜人民，是任何困难吓不倒的。你们依靠自己忘我的劳动，不仅迅速医治好了战争的创伤，而且在几乎是一片废墟之上，把自己祖国建设得更美丽了。你们继提前两年半完成第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划之后，已在准备执行将使朝鲜民主主义人民共和国更加繁荣富强的新的七年计划。朝鲜人民的这一切伟大成就，不仅大大有利于朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的斗争，而且壮大了社会主义阵营的力量。
    同朝鲜人民跨上千里马加速向社会主义飞奔一样，我国人民高举党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，继1958年和1959年两年的连续大跃进之后，今年又在社会主义建设方面取得了新的成就；争取今后在国民经济发展中实现持续的、全面的跃进的热潮，正在席卷全国。我国人民有充分的信心，在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下，在不太长的时间内，把我们国家建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义国家。帝国主义、反动派和现代修正主义者对我国的建设成就，有着刻骨的嫉恨。但是，不管他们怎样对我国进行恶毒的攻击，都不能够阻挡我们朝着自己的伟大目标胜利前进。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！我们现在面临着一个空前有利的国际形势。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量空前强大，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动风起云涌，资本主义国家人民的革命斗争正在进一步发展，各国人民保卫世界和平的运动日益广泛和深入。今年以来，日本、朝鲜南部、土耳其、越南南方和老挝等许多亚洲国家和地区的人民，连续掀起了反美大风暴；帝国主义在非洲的殖民体系正面临着彻底崩溃的危险；在拉丁美洲，英雄的古巴人民对美帝国主义的斗争获得了巨大胜利。
    我国政府一贯奉行和平外交政策；一贯努力争取缓和国际紧张局势，实现不同社会制度国家和平共处；一贯支持苏联及其他社会主义国家有关普遍裁军、禁止核武器等和平倡议。美帝国主义虽然至今还霸占着我国领土台湾，我们仍然主张用谈判方式解决两国争端。今年以来，我国政府先后同亚非许多国家签订了友好和互不侵犯条约或和平友好条约。不久以前，我们还和缅甸政府签订了边界条约。我国政府一再倡议亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内，签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约，使这个地区成为无核武器地区。但是，美帝国主义却顽固地坚持敌视社会主义阵营的政策，拒绝和平共处；坚持新殖民主义，要继续掠夺和奴役亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民；坚持扩军备战，拒绝裁军。当然，任凭帝国主义穷凶极恶，它也无法阻挡历史车轮的飞跃前进。只要对帝国主义保持应有的警惕，坚决依靠全世界爱好和平的人民，结成最广泛的统一战线，同美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，那末，美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策是完全可以被粉碎的。美国侵略者迟早要从朝鲜南部，从我国领土台湾，从它所占领的其他国家的领土上滚开的。被美国侵占的台湾，一定要重归中国人民的怀抱；被人为地分割开来的朝鲜南北三千万同胞，一定要重新获得团聚。各国人民争取世界和平、民族独立、民主自由和社会主义的事业，一定能够不断地取得新的更大的胜利。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！在我这个讲话就要结束的时候，请让我再一次感谢朝鲜人民对中国人民的深情厚谊。并请允许我借此机会，把所有参加过抗美援朝的志愿军官兵对朝鲜人民的怀念和感激，转达给英雄的平壤人民和全体英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军。
    中朝两国人民及其军队牢不可破的国际主义团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
