Premier U Nu's Speech at the People of the Capital's Celebration of the Signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty

Respected Premier Zhou Enlai, beloved Vice Mayor Wan Li, friends:

Yesterday, I and all the members of the Burmese Special Mission were honored to participate in the celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China. It was such a joyous and magnificent celebration that it greatly inspired all of us. I have visited your beautiful capital, Beijing, for the third time, and this is the most interesting and joyful one for me. Yesterday was an unforgettable day, especially the grand National Day parade, including various artistic troupes, various ethnic groups, and various local costumes, which formed a beautiful picture with rich colors and endless changes. The grand solemnity and colorfulness of the National Day celebrations also specifically proved the extremely high cultural level and great achievements of your great country, which is worthy of pride.

Today, I have the opportunity to meet with you and speak at such a warm mass rally, which greatly adds to our joy and happiness in participating in the National Day celebrations. I am very grateful to your leaders for giving me this extraordinary honor and pleasure. I will always remember this festive scene with pride and satisfaction.

In addition to feeling proud and satisfied because of such a great opportunity to meet with you and speak to you, I am also excited to think that this meeting will have a positive significance for both our countries and for the world. This is because our two countries have finally resolved a long-standing issue that has existed between them for more than a thousand years, and this resolution was reached by the two countries in a satisfactory, voluntary, friendly, and harmonious manner.

You must know that the Burmese people, the most numerous among the various ethnic groups in the Union of Burma, are of Central Asian descent. They migrated slowly southward towards the Indian Ocean a long time ago. Therefore, the Burmese people are an Asian nation, who settled in the Irrawaddy, Chindwin, Sittang, and Salween River basins, and established the first Burmese Empire under the rule of King Anawrahta in the eleventh century.

Since then, there have been friendly and harmonious relations between Burma and China. Chinese history records that Burmese envoys visited your country's capital during the Song Dynasty and were treated with courtesy. There has long been free and extensive cultural and economic contact between the two countries.

Sino-Burmese relations, until the end of the Burmese dynasty, were generally good. For several centuries, the two countries maintained close and friendly commercial, cultural, and diplomatic relations, with interruptions being the exception.

As you all know, these interruptions only occurred when China itself was invaded in its history by rulers with imperialist ambitions. At such times, the damage to peaceful relations between Burma and China was more or less a continuation of China's own experience. During these times, the harmonious and friendly relations between the two countries were affected, although not for long and not extensively. In fact, peace between the two countries was disrupted only twice in history.

Once, the Mongol rulers invaded China and marched all the way to Burma. At that time, the Pagan dynasty of Burma ended. But peace between China and Burma was quickly restored, and harmonious relations existed between them again.

The second time was when China was ruled by the Manchu emperors. Due to an imperialist adventure by one of the Manchu emperors, our country was again involved. But four years later, peace was restored between the two countries, and harmonious and friendly relations were rebuilt. Diplomatic relations were also enthusiastically and harmoniously restored. A famous Burmese long poem was written to celebrate the re-establishment of peace and harmony after a four-year interruption, and the reception of the Chinese envoy at the Burmese court.

Dear Chinese friends!

The history of Sino-Burmese relations shows that, apart from the two rare situations I mentioned above, the normal state between our two countries is continuous peace and friendship. The relations between China and Burma, especially during the period when China was ruled by the Han people, were very harmonious and close.

Whenever I think of the friendly and harmonious relations that actually existed between our two countries in history, I feel very happy in my heart. When I look forward, I also feel encouraged and confident, because the past history of relations foreshadows an auspicious future.

In view of the historical fact that our two countries have indeed been neighboring each other in peace and harmony for centuries, you - my friends - will agree with me that the Sino-Burmese friendship that is so richly embodied today, as well as the permanent continuation of this friendship, has a solid and reliable foundation.

I am indeed very pleased to have this opportunity to trace the past history of our two countries' relations, because it must be viewed in connection with the past. Yesterday, the leaders of our two countries signed the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, which is an agreement freely and voluntarily reached by the two countries, and both sides are satisfied and in agreement. I am convinced that one of the factors that made the successful conclusion of such a treaty possible is the undeniable fact that Sino-Burmese friendship has a solid and reliable foundation laid down in history.

Perhaps some people will raise this question: Since our two countries have had peaceful and harmonious relations in history, why is a boundary treaty still needed?

This question can be answered completely and satisfactorily.

We don't need to spend much thought to answer this question. In this era of advanced science, there are no insurmountable obstacles between the two countries. Distance has lost its meaning. In fact, there is no part of the earth that has not been explored and cannot be reached by humans. In such a scientific era, is it not necessary for all countries in the world to have a clear and definite understanding of their boundaries, especially the boundaries between each other?

Only with such a precise and definite understanding can the principle of mutual respect for territorial integrity be correctly implemented without the risk of causing misunderstandings.

Only when there are no misunderstandings between the two countries regarding territorial boundaries can disputes regarding territorial boundaries be avoided.

Only when such disputes do not occur can the continuous friendly and harmonious relations between the two countries be maintained permanently.

Therefore, in this scientific era, clearly demarcating boundaries has become an important matter.

Indeed, our two countries have always lived in peace, harmony, and friendship throughout history. Indeed, the foundation of our mutual respect and friendship is solid and immense.

But in ancient times, due to the lack of an urgent sense of this need, the boundary between the two countries was not demarcated as precisely and comprehensively as it is now.

In modern times, when the Burmese dynasty was replaced by British rule, the issue of demarcating the Sino-Burmese boundary was only partially resolved, and part of the boundary remained undemarcated.

Therefore, in this scientific era where exchanges between countries are convenient, it is our responsibility to precisely demarcate the undemarcated part of our two countries' common boundary, so that there will be no possibility of any disputes or misunderstandings regarding territorial boundaries. If there are no such misunderstandings, the friendly and harmonious relations between our two countries will last forever.

This is a responsibility that both our countries must bear and fulfill. This is not an easy task. This is a noble task, which must be undertaken in good faith, starting from the interests of our two countries and from the interests of world peace.

Given this, after Burma became an independent and autonomous country and the People's Republic of China was founded, the governments of the two countries were determined to fulfill this great and noble duty.

Thus, the governments of the two countries devoted themselves to the work of demarcating the undemarcated parts of the boundary. You will remember that I came to your beautiful capital for this matter, once as Prime Minister and another time as a representative of Prime Minister U Ba Swe. You will remember that General Ne Win, during his tenure as Prime Minister of Burma, came here to discuss this issue. You will also remember that Premier Zhou Enlai, representing your government, visited our country to discuss this matter.

These talks gradually progressed, reaching a satisfactory and successful conclusion for both sides in January 1960.

Yesterday, October 1, 1960, was the festive occasion of the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the leaders of our two governments signed the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, which resolved the Sino-Burmese boundary issue. This resolution was reached freely, voluntarily, and to the satisfaction of both countries.

On behalf of the government and people of the Union of Burma, I would like to express my admiration and gratitude for the goodwill and understanding shown by the Government of the People's Republic of China, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, former Ambassador to Burma Yao Zhongming, and the hard work done by Chinese government officials that made the signing of the treaty possible.

I believe that you - the friends gathered here today - will be as pleased and happy as we are about the signing of this boundary treaty.

The fact proves that the foundation of the friendship between our two countries has always been solid and reliable.

Therefore, the boundary treaty we signed yesterday is a great and magnificent building of common friendship built on this solid foundation.

But is it enough to build this magnificent building of friendship between the two countries? Dear Chinese friends! This is by no means the end of the matter. There is another task to be completed.

This task is to not let the great and beautiful building of friendship that we have created be spoiled, but to do everything in our power to protect and maintain this building, so that it will always remain novel, magnificent, brilliant, and glorious. Maintaining the original solidity and brilliance of the building of Sino-Burmese friendship is not only the task of this generation of people in China and Burma, but also the task that future generations of the two countries must bear, so that this building of friendship can always maintain its brilliance and be free from blemish for generations to come.

Fortunately, there is a ready-made means or method that enables us all to fully fulfill the great task of protecting this building of peace and friendship.

This method is none other than the correct and faithful implementation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which, as you know, were personally proposed by Premier Zhou Enlai in 1954.

In fact, the successful conclusion of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty is the result of the two countries' adherence to and implementation of these five principles.

Therefore, in the same way in the future, if we adhere to these five principles in all our actions, the great building of friendship that our two countries built yesterday will not only remain solid and unshakeable, but will also become more solemn and beautiful.

Dear Chinese friends:

I believe you are very familiar with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. But please allow me to briefly restate these principles. The five principles are:

(1) Mutual respect for territorial sovereignty;

(2) Mutual non-aggression;

(3) Mutual non-interference in internal affairs;

(4) Equality in status, engaging in mutually beneficial work;

(5) Peaceful coexistence between countries with different social, political, and economic systems.

If we carefully consider these five principles, we will understand that these are the principles that every country in the world should abide by and implement in the current world situation.

It is precisely because the People's Republic of China has implemented these five principles that the Sino-Burmese boundary issue, which has not been resolved for nearly a hundred years, has finally been thoroughly resolved. It is precisely because the People's Republic of China has adhered to these five principles that our two countries have been able to freely, voluntarily, and satisfactorily sign the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty.

At the same time, on our part, because we believe in the effectiveness and vitality of the five principles, we will also fully adhere to these principles in the future. In our relations with all other countries, we will sincerely and faithfully implement these principles, using them as a guide, just as a traveler uses a bright light as a guide in the dark night.

Dear friends! We fully believe that you will handle your relations with other countries in the same way, adhering to these principles and using them as a guiding light.

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

Long live Chairman Liu Shaoqi!

Long live Premier Zhou Enlai!

Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!

### 在首都各界人民庆祝中缅边界条约签订大会上  吴努总理的讲话

专栏：

    在首都各界人民庆祝中缅边界条约签订大会上
    吴努总理的讲话尊敬的周恩来总理阁下，敬爱的万里副市长，朋友们：
    昨天我和缅甸特命代表团的全体团员荣幸地参加了中华人民共和国成立纪念的庆典。那是一次这样欢乐和壮观的庆典，使我们大家都非常振奋。我已经第三次访问你们美丽的首都北京了，而对我来说这是最有兴味、最快乐的一次。昨天是一个难忘的日子，特别令人难忘的是盛大的国庆游行，包括各种文艺队伍，各种民族，各种地方服装，组成了声色并茂，千变万化的美妙图景。国庆庆祝节日的宏伟庄严和万紫千红也具体证明了你们伟大国家足以自豪的极高的文化水平和巨大的成就。
    今天我有机会和你们会见并在这样热烈的群众大会上讲话更是无比地增添了我们参加国庆庆典的喜悦和高兴。我十分感谢你们的领导人给予我这一格外的光荣和愉快。我将永远以骄傲和满意的心情记住这个喜庆的场面。
    除了因为有这样一个极好的机会同你们会见并向你们讲话而感到骄傲和满意以外，我也兴奋地想到，这次大会将对我们两国以及对全世界具有积极的意义。这是由于我们两国已经最后解决了两国间存在了一千多年的一个长期的问题，而且这个解决是两国在双方满意、自愿、友好、和谐的情况下达成的。
    你们一定知道，缅甸联邦各族人民中人数最多的缅甸人，是属于中亚细亚血统。他们是很久以前慢慢地向南朝印度洋迁移过来的。因此，缅甸人是一个亚细亚民族，他们定居在伊洛瓦底、亲敦、西汤和萨尔温江流域，而且在十一世纪时在安哪耶塔王统治下建立了第一个缅甸帝国。
    从那时起缅甸和中国之间就有了友好和睦的关系。中国史书上载明宋朝时候缅甸使者就到过贵国的首都，受到了礼遇。很早以来两国之间就存在着自由和广泛的文化和经济联系。
    中缅关系直到缅甸王朝结束为止，总的说来基本上是很好的，好几个世纪的期间两国之间一直保持着密切而友好的商业、文化和外交关系，中断只是例外。
    你们都知道，这些中断的出现只是当中国本身在自己历史上遭到具有帝国主义野心的统治者的侵略的时候，在这种时候，缅中和平关系所遭到的破坏多多少少正是中国自己所受的遭遇的延续。在这些时候，两国之间的和谐友好的关系受到了影响，虽然时间不长，范围不广。实际上，在历史上两国之间的和平只有两次遭到了破坏。
    一次是蒙古统治者侵入了中国，一直进军到缅甸。那时缅甸蒲甘王朝结束了。但是中国和缅甸之间的和平很快得到恢复，和睦的关系又存在于它们之间了。
    第二次是当中国受到满族皇帝统治的时候。由于满族的一个皇帝的帝国主义冒险行动，我国又受到牵连。但是四年以后，两国之间又恢复了和平，重建了和睦友好的关系。外交关系也热情而和谐地恢复了。有一首出名的缅甸长诗就是为庆祝中断四年后重新建立和平与和谐的关系，中国使者到达缅甸宫廷受到接待的情况而写的。
    亲爱的中国朋友们！
    中缅关系的历史说明，除去我上面提到的两次稀有的情况以外，我们两国之间的正常的情况是持续的和平和友谊。中国和缅甸的关系，特别是在中国由汉族统治的时期，是非常和睦和亲密的。
    每当我想起历史上实际存在的我们两国之间的友好和谐关系时，我心中就感到非常愉快。当我朝前看时，我也感到鼓舞和有信心，因为过去的关系史预兆着吉祥的未来。
    鉴于我们两国几个世纪以来确实在和平与和谐中相邻而处的历史事实，你们——我的朋友们——会同意我的意见：今天有着这样丰富体现的中缅友谊以及这种友谊的永久继续，是具有坚固牢靠的基础的。
    我的确非常高兴能有这个机会来追述我们两国关系的过去历史，因为现在必须同过去联系来看。昨天，我们两国的领导人签订了中缅边界条约，这是两国自由、自愿地达成的协议，双方都感到满意和一致。我确信，使得这样一个条约能够成功地缔结的因素之一，就是中缅友谊存在着历史上奠定下来的坚实牢固的基础，这样一个无可否认的事实。
    也许有人会提出这样的问题：既然我们两国在历史上就有着和平与和谐的关系，为什么还需要一个边界条约呢？
    这个问题可以得到完全的和令人满意的答复。
    我们不需要费很多脑筋就可以回答这个问题。在现在这个科学发达的时代，两国之间再也没有任何不可逾越的障碍了。距离已失去了意义。事实上，地球上已没有那一部分是未经探测和人类不能达到的了。在这样一个科学时代里，世界上的所有国家对于自己的边界，特别是相互之间的边界，有一个明确肯定的了解，这难道不是需要的吗？
    只有具备这样确切和肯定的了解，才能正确地实行互相尊重领土完整的原则，而不致有引起误会的危险。
    只有两国之间关于领土界限不发生误会，才不致发生有关领土界限的纠纷。
    只有不发生这种纠纷，两国之间持续的友好和谐关系才能永久维持。
    因此，在这个科学的时代里，明确划定边界已成为一件重要的事情。
    的确，我们两国在历史上一直和平、和睦、友好地相处。的确，我们互相尊重和友谊的基础是坚实和巨大的。
    但是在古代，由于没有迫切地感到这种需要，两国之间的边界，没有像现在这样精确、全面地划定。
    在近代，当缅甸王朝为英国的统治所代替时，划定中缅边界的问题只是部分地得到解决，还有一部分边界仍然没有划定。
    因此，在这个国与国之间来往方便的科学时代，我们有责任确切地划定我们两国共同边界中尚未标定的部分，这样才不会有发生关于领土界限的任何纠纷和引起误会的可能。如果没有这种误会，我们两国之间的友好和谐的关系就会长存。
    这是我们两国都必须负担和履行的责任。这不是一件轻而易举的事。这是一个崇高的任务，必须从我们两国的利益出发，从世界和平的利益出发，抱着善意来从事这个任务。
    既然如此，在缅甸成为独立自主的国家和中华人民共和国成立之后，两国政府就决心履行这个伟大而崇高的职责。
    于是，两国政府就致力于划定边界尚未标定部分的工作。你们会记得，为了这件事，我曾来过你们美丽的首都，一次是以总理的身分，另一次是代表吴巴瑞总理。你们会记得，奈温将军，在他担任缅甸总理期间曾到这里来商谈这问题。你们也会记得，周恩来总理代表贵国政府曾访问我国讨论这件事。
    这些会谈逐渐进展，在1960年1月达到了使双方都感到满意的胜利结束。
    昨天，1960年10月1日，是中华人民共和国成立纪念的佳节，我们两国政府领导人签订了中缅边界条约，它解决了中缅边界问题，这个解决是在自由、自愿和两国都感到满意的情况下达成的。
    我谨代表缅甸联邦政府和人民，对于中华人民共和国政府、周恩来总理、外交部章汉夫副部长、前驻缅大使姚仲明先生所表现的善意和谅解以及使签订条约成为可能的中国政府官员所进行的艰苦的工作表示钦佩和感谢。
    我相信你们——今天在这里集会的朋友们——会同我们一样，对于这个边界条约的签订感到愉快和高兴。
    事实证明，我们两国的友谊的基础历来就是巩固和可靠的。
    因此，昨天我们签订的边界条约就是一座建筑在这个坚固基础上的伟大和壮丽的共同友谊的大厦。
    但是，难道建立这一座宏伟的两国友谊大厦就够了吗？亲爱的中国朋友们！这决不是事情的终结。还有另一项任务有待完成。
    这项任务就是不让我们所创立的这座伟大和美丽的友谊大厦败坏，而要尽我们的一切力量保护和维持这座大厦，使它永远保持新颖、华丽、灿烂和光荣。保持中缅友谊大厦原来的坚固和光辉，不但是中缅两国人民这一代人的任务，也是两国后代子孙所必须负担的任务，以使这座友谊大厦能世世代代一直永保光彩而不受污损。
    十分幸运，有一种现成的手段或者方法可以使我们大家能够充分履行保护这座和平和友谊大厦的伟大任务。
    这个方法不是别的，就是正确地和忠实地执行，如你们所知道的，1954年周恩来总理亲自提出的和平共处五项原则。
    事实上，中缅边界条约的圆满缔结，正是两国遵守和执行这五项原则的结果。
    因此，同样在将来，如果我们在一切行动中都信守这五项原则，我们两国昨天建立起来的伟大的友谊大厦不但将保持坚固不移，而且会变得更加庄严和美丽。
    亲爱的中国朋友们：
    我相信你们十分熟悉和平共处五项原则。但是请让我简单地把这些原则重述一下。五项原则是：
    （1）互相尊重领土主权；
    （2）互不侵犯；
    （3）互不干涉内政；
    （4）地位平等，从事于相互有利的工作；
    （5）不同社会、政治、经济制度的国家和平共处。
    如果我们仔细思考这五项原则，我们就会懂得这是目前世界形势下世界上每一个国家都应当遵守和实行的原则。
    正因为中华人民共和国实行了这五项原则，所以将近一百年没有解决的中缅边界问题最后有可能得到彻底的解决。正因为中华人民共和国信守这五项原则，所以我们两国有可能自由、自愿和使双方满意地签订了中缅边界条约。
    同时，在我们方面，由于我们相信五项原则的有效性和生命力，我们今后也将完全信守这些原则。在我国同所有其他国家的关系中，我们将真诚和忠实地实行这些原则，以它们为向导，正如一个旅行者在黑夜里以一个明亮的光为向导一样。
    亲爱的朋友们！我们完全相信你们也会同样地处理你们同其他国家的关系，信守这些原则，并且以它们为指路的明灯。
    毛泽东主席万岁！
    刘少奇主席万岁！
    周恩来总理万岁！
    中缅友好万岁！
