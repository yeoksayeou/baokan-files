Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, October 20th: The Albanian Democratic Front National Committee, on the 19th, called on workers, peasants, and people's intellectuals to conscientiously discuss and study the draft directives for the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) for the development of Albania's economy and culture, formulated by the Labor Party. The National Committee also called on them to put forward opinions and suggestions in order to improve industrial and agricultural production, shorten the time needed to carry out construction better and more economically, reduce costs, and improve quality.

This call was made by the Democratic Front National Committee in a letter to the people of the whole country.

The letter to the people pointed out that the draft directives for the Third Five-Year Plan is a historic document that reflects the great achievements Albania has made during the Second Five-Year Plan and determines the path for Albania's further development towards socialism. The letter to the people said that every factory, agricultural cooperative, and production unit must tap its potential to increase labor productivity and increase production. Agricultural cooperative members, tractor drivers, and agricultural workers must take all measures to harvest crops as early as possible and without loss, and complete the autumn planting plan quickly and well.

The Democratic Front National Committee called on the Albanian people to further unite into the ranks of the Democratic Front and strengthen their iron-like solidarity, under the leadership of the glorious Labor Party, on the one hand, to mobilize all forces to build socialism, and on the other hand, to be forever vigilant against imperialism headed by the United States, and against modern revisionism, especially against Belgrade revisionism, which is hostile to the historical victories of the Albanian people and tries its best to hinder them from achieving victory.

The letter to the people also called on the Albanian people to contribute to the consolidation and iron-like unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to the consolidation of peace.
