Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 27th. North Vietnam's early rice has been successively harvested, and good news of bumper harvests are frequently reported.

This year, the planting area of early rice in North Vietnam accounts for more than one-fourth of the planting area of late rice. Various localities have generally improved farming techniques, strengthened field management, and increased fertilizer application, resulting in generally good harvests. Shuiyuan County, a suburb of Haiphong City, harvested more than 360 hectares of early rice, with an average yield of 2,983 kilograms per hectare, an increase of more than 34% over the same period last year. In Bac Giang Province, 6,000 hectares of early rice have been harvested, achieving a large-scale bumper harvest with an average yield of 2,130 kilograms per hectare. Shanxi Province is also in the midst of harvesting, with continuous good news of large-scale average yields of 2,300 to 3,000 kilograms being reported from various localities.

Preliminary statistics show that the agricultural cooperatives have the highest yields in various localities. In Thai Binh, Hung Yen, Thanh Hoa, Cao Bang, Phu Tho and other provinces, the average yield per hectare of agricultural cooperatives is generally more than 400 kilograms higher than that of individual farmers in the area. In Thach An, Hoa An, and Tra Linh counties of Cao Bang province, the average harvest per hectare for general farmers is between 2,200 kilograms and 2,800 kilograms, while agricultural cooperatives reach 3,100 kilograms, with the highest reaching 4,600 kilograms.

    普遍改进耕作技术加强田间管理
    越南北方早熟稻喜获丰收
    新华社河内27日电　越南北方的早熟稻已经陆续收割，丰产喜讯频频传来。
    今年，越南北方早熟稻的种植面积约占晚稻种植面积的四分之一以上。各地普遍改进耕作技术，加强田间管理和增施肥料，因而收成普遍良好。海防市郊水源县收割了三百六十多公顷早熟稻，平均每公顷产量达到二千九百八十三公斤，比去年同期增产34％多。北江省已收割的六千公顷早熟稻获得了大面积丰收，平均每公顷产量达二千一百三十公斤。山西省也在紧张收割中，各地不断传出大面积平均丰产二千三百公斤到三千公斤的喜讯。
    初步统计表明，各地产量最高的都是农业合作社。太平、兴安、清化、高平、富寿等省农业合作社，每公顷产量一般比当地单干农民多四百公斤以上。高平省石安、和安、茶灵等县一般农户每公顷收获量在二千二百公斤到二千八百公斤，而农业合作社则达三千一百公斤，最高达到四千六百公斤。
    与此同时，越南北方的一百四十多万公顷晚稻，普遍生长良好。（附图片）
