Editor's Note: How should cadres work after going deep into the front lines? What should they grasp first? This is a very important and urgent question to answer. Comrade Zhang Shoukai, Secretary of the Wuqiao County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, wrote this article based on his long experience in rural work. This is an article with analysis, discussion, reality, and theory, which is very helpful for cadres who go deep into the grassroots.

The real front line of agricultural production is the production team. The production team is not only a unit for organizing production, but also the most basic level for organizing people's lives and all work, and the focal point for implementing the Party's various guidelines and policies. No matter what work, it must be implemented and fulfilled in the production team. It is very important to strengthen the leadership of the production team and do a good job in the production team. After arriving at the team, what should we grasp? My experience in work is:

Grasp Key Tasks

The production team has heavy tasks and many things to do. We cannot grasp everything we see or grasp a handful of things randomly. Instead, we must grasp the main contradictions in the work and grasp the key tasks. As long as we grasp the key tasks, other work tasks will be completed smoothly. What are the key tasks of the production team? They are agricultural production, people's livelihood, Party policies, ideological education, and grassroots organization. These five tasks involve people, materials, theory, and reality. They promote, restrict, and depend on each other, so these tasks are very important. However, the most important and fundamental, that is, the most critical tasks, are two: production and livelihood. Grasping the implementation of the Party's policies to ensure that every policy is implemented; grasping the political and ideological work of cadres and commune members to timely solve ideological problems that affect and hinder the development of production; grasping the goal of improving grassroots cadres and cultivating and expanding the ranks of activists, are also for the purpose of doing a good job in production and livelihood. Therefore, if the latter three tasks are not grasped well, the former two cannot be grasped well.

Grasp Key Links

To do a good job in production and livelihood, we must also grasp the key links to doing a good job in production and livelihood. What are these key links? At present, when agricultural production has not yet been mechanized and a large amount of farm work still relies on manual operation, the key lies in grasping labor. Because labor is the material basis and prerequisite for doing a good job in production. To grasp labor, we must grasp three aspects: First, the labor attendance rate; second, the rational use of labor; and third, the improvement of labor efficiency. First of all, starting from checking the labor attendance, we should see how much labor is directly invested in production, and whether it reflects the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation. According to the survey, the labor force put into field production in advanced teams with good production is more than 75%; the labor force put into field production in average teams with average production is about 70%; and the labor force put into field production in backward teams with poor production is about 60%. The reasons for low attendance: First, the team has not done a good job in childcare, and women with children have not achieved full attendance; second, the family members of individual cadres do not attend; and third, some wealthy households with foreign exchange income, some of whom do not like to work, do not attend. In order to ensure attendance, it is necessary to earnestly solve practical problems and do a good job in ideological work. For example, for the actual difficulties of women with children, the team should actively organize nurseries to help them take care of their children; for the problems of family members of relevant cadres, it is necessary to educate the cadres and solve the cadres' ideas of demanding special treatment; for those who do not like to work, it is necessary to conduct education on loving labor is the most glorious. In short, no matter what ideological problems, we must earnestly carry out ideological work in a tit-for-tat manner, mobilize all the commune members, and achieve full attendance. Secondly, it is necessary to use labor rationally. After mobilizing all the labor force, it must be used rationally. How can it be considered rational use? First, put the main force on the most critical farm work of production, and use it where it is most needed; second, do not have the phenomenon of idling and wasting work, we must find out how much work there is, how many people are used for each job, and what kind of people are used, so as to achieve the best use of talents, assign jobs according to people, and allocate them scientifically and rationally. For example, the current work of the "three autumns" is in progress, and sowing wheat is the center of the "three autumns" work. Labor should be concentrated on sowing wheat to ensure more sowing, early sowing, and good sowing. If the autumn harvest is not finished and the stubble cannot be vacated, the autumn harvest can be rushed first, or the labor force can be appropriately divided into several groups, some in charge of harvesting and some in charge of sowing, harvesting and sowing at the same time. However, it is also necessary to pay attention to the combination between the groups to prevent uneven workload. Thirdly, improve labor efficiency. The method of improving labor efficiency is, first of all, to adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen ideological education, and continue to build up revolutionary enthusiasm. Advanced ideas are the driving force for encouraging labor enthusiasm. The same tools, used by people with different ideological awareness, will produce different labor efficiency. This shows that people's thinking is the decisive condition. In order to do a good job in ideological work, in addition to general socialist education, no matter what kind of work is done, commune members must be told the purpose and significance of doing this work, and they will be motivated to do it. Work arrangements should also be specific. Who does what, and what tools to bring, should be explained to the commune members in advance. Secondly, strengthen labor management, implement labor quotas, and establish and improve labor organizations. According to the needs of production and taking into account personal expertise, rationally organize the labor force into several work groups, and establish a production responsibility system to achieve specific tasks, clear responsibilities, and reasonable remuneration. It is also necessary to earnestly do a good job in labor quotas. There are two meanings to doing quotas: one is to stipulate labor tasks according to people, which must be guaranteed to be completed, and labor points will be paid according to the quality of completion; the other is that there should be rewards for exceeding the quota, and more work gets more. Only in this way can the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members be mobilized; thirdly, solve the tool problem. To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools. Different tools will have different labor efficiency. Carrying a basket of manure by two people and pushing two baskets with a small cart by one person, the work efficiency will be three times different. Many facts have proved that reforming tools is the key link to improving labor efficiency; fourthly, grasp the operating procedures. Doing a good job in the operating procedures and arranging the order of doing work is skillful work, which has a great relationship to improving efficiency. For example, when watering, we must first level the land, do a good job in the ridge field project, measure the horizon, determine where the water comes from, and then release water to water the land, so that it will be watered quickly and well. If one hand is not done well, although it takes effort, it will still be watered in a mess; fifthly, pay attention to the combination of work and rest, take care of and help commune members solve their immediate interests, and care for commune members everywhere, help them solve difficulties, which is also an important link to stimulate commune members' production enthusiasm and improve labor efficiency.

Grasping livelihood is mainly to run the canteen well. Running the canteen well is very important, because if the livelihood is not done well, it will affect production and hinder personal health. The key to running the canteen well lies in cadres eating in the canteen, cadres running the canteen, and poor and lower-middle peasants and activists managing the canteen. When we grasp livelihood, we must first grasp the cadres, grasp whether the cadres eat in the canteen, and whether eating in the canteen is the same as the commune members in terms of quantity and quality. This question is very important, because only when the cadres eat the same food as the commune members will they know whether there is a problem, will they be active in managing it, and will they solve the problem thoroughly. At the same time, it is necessary to check who runs the canteen, and who is in charge of the canteen? Is it the poor and lower-middle peasants and activists, or the well-to-do middle peasants, or the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in charge? Finding a good person in charge of the canteen is an important link to running the canteen well. Because the rural public canteen is the socialist position in the countryside, and also the bud of communism. Therefore, the canteen must be in the hands of the most reliable people, and the poor and lower-middle peasants should be in charge. Why must the poor and lower-middle peasants be in charge? Because they were the most oppressed in the old society, suffered the most, and were the most resolute in the revolution. Their class consciousness is higher, they listen to the Party, and they especially support the people's communes and public canteens. Not only do they have good ideas, but they also have the good style of diligence and thrift, they can live a good life, and they can also live a rich life as a poor life. Only when they are in charge of the canteen can they manage it well. On the premise of solving the above two problems, it is also necessary to grasp planned grain use, thrifty grain use, and implement the policy of fixed quantity per person, quotas to households, eating with tickets, and saving for oneself; vigorously develop domestic production, grow vegetables well, and raise more pigs, so that commune members can eat their fill and eat well. At the same time, it is also necessary to pay attention to doing a good job in canteen management, publishing accounts regularly, and mobilizing the masses to run the canteen well.

Do a Good Job of "People" Work

After the cadres go deep into the team, in addition to doing a good job in key tasks, it is also necessary to grasp the "people's" organization, mobilization, and ideological work. There are two targets to grasp: one is to cultivate and improve grassroots cadres; the other is to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and launch a mass movement. The team cadres are the bridge between the Party and the masses, and are the specific implementers of the Party's line, guidelines, and policies. The Party must concentrate the opinions of the masses through them as the basis for formulating the line, guidelines, and policies. The Party must correctly implement the correct line, guidelines, and policies to the masses, and they need to conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological work and organizational work among the masses. The team cadres are also the direct leaders and organizers of the production and lives of the people. They must not only lead the production of the team well, but also organize the lives of hundreds of people. Therefore, vigorously cultivating and improving the political and ideological level and business work ability of the team cadres is the unshirkable political task of every comrade who goes to work in the team.

The method of cultivating team cadres should grasp the "three combinations": (1) Combining strengthening ideological education with personal exemplary actions: First of all, it is necessary to strengthen putting politics in command for the team cadres, conduct ideological education, improve their ideological awareness, and strengthen their policy concepts. At the same time, individuals must strictly demand themselves, and every word and deed must play an exemplary role, and everything must be done in accordance with the Party's policies and requirements, and work must be done in a down-to-earth and realistic manner, the style must be arduous and simple, we must dare to overcome difficulties, and unite the masses well, among the masses, discuss things with the masses, and set an example in everything, and educate and influence them with practical actions; (2) Combining being a good consultant with bold use. Going to work in the team is to be a consultant for the team cadres, not to monopolize and replace their work. Being a consultant is to help them improve their ideological level and policy level, improve their ability to analyze practical problems, help them come up with ideas and think of ways, improve their leadership level, and help them do their work well. In actual work, we must boldly let them work, so that they dare to be boldly responsible, constantly improve their work ability, and actively complete the Party's tasks; (3) Combining educating and improving cadres with caring for cadres' difficulties. Actively educate and improve the ideological level of team cadres, so that they can establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly with selflessness and public interest. However, in some practical problems, we must take into account the actual difficulties of the cadres, pay attention to helping solve their actual difficulties, so that they can feel the warmth of the Party to them everywhere, and always maintain revolutionary enthusiasm.

If you want to mobilize the broad masses, you must go to the masses. The most important thing is to work and live with them, eat, live, work, and discuss together, without being special at all, and completely integrate with them, becoming true confidants, which is the foundation for doing a good job in mass work. Mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the masses must also master the method of "three combinations": (1) Combining strengthening ideological education with linking to reality. Ideological education for the masses must be linked to reality, and education with facts, using the methods of accounting, recalling, and comparison is the most effective education method. For example, in the work of sowing wheat, telling the commune members first that sowing wheat requires more sowing and good sowing, and what are the benefits of more sowing and good sowing, is not as good as educating the commune members through summarizing the experience of sowing wheat this year, so that the commune members consciously and actively sow wheat well; (2) Combining mobilizing the masses with solving problems. After the masses have been mobilized and put into the fields to participate in production, it is necessary to pay attention to solving their practical problems in order to maintain the enthusiasm of the masses regularly. Such as women making clothes, taking care of children, etc., these are all practical problems, which must be properly solved, and if they are not solved well, they will appear with needles and threads in the field or not attending. More importantly, not solving the practical problems of the masses will cause dissatisfaction among the masses and affect production morale; (3) Combining publicizing policies with embodying policies. It is necessary to publicize the Party's various policies to the masses in a timely manner, so that the policies can meet with the masses. This is relatively easy to do, but more importantly, we must act in accordance with the Party's policies and embody the policies. If we only publicize the policies and do not implement the policies, it will reduce the prestige of the Party's policies among the masses, and it will seriously affect the production enthusiasm of the masses. If these three combinations are done well, the production enthusiasm of the masses will be mobilized to the greatest extent.

    干部深入第一线要抓什么
    中共吴桥县委书记处书记　张寿凯
    编者按：干部深入第一线以后怎样工作？首先要抓些什么？这是一个非常重要和亟待回答的问题。中共吴桥县委书记处书记张寿凯同志，根据自己长期在农村工作的经验写了这篇文章，这是一篇有分析、有议论，有虚、有实的文章，对深入基层的干部很有帮助。
    真正的农业生产第一线是生产小队。生产小队不仅仅是组织生产的单位，还是组织人民生活和一切工作的最基层，是贯彻执行党的各项方针、政策的集中点。无论什么工作，都必须到生产小队去落实兑现。加强生产小队的领导，做好生产小队的工作，是非常重要的。到小队以后，要抓什么呢？我在工作中的体会是：
    抓关键性的任务
    生产小队的任务很重，事情很多，不能见什么抓什么，乱抓一把；而是要抓工作中的主要矛盾，抓关键性的任务。只要把关键性的任务抓住了，其它工作任务就会顺利地完成。生产小队的关键任务是什么呢？就是农业生产、群众生活、党的政策、思想教育、基层组织。这五项任务有人、有物，有虚、有实，它们之间是互相促进、互相制约、互相依赖的，所以这几项工作都很重要。但是，最重要、最根本的，也就是最关键性的任务有两个：一是生产，二是生活。抓贯彻执行党的政策，使条条政策落实；抓干部、社员的政治思想工作，及时地解决影响和障碍生产发展的思想问题；抓住提高基层干部，培养壮大积极分子队伍的目的，也是为了搞好生产、生活。因此，后三项抓不好，就抓不好前两项。
    抓关键性的环节
    抓好生产、生活，还必须抓好做好生产、生活工作的关键环节。这些关键环节是什么呢？在目前农业生产还没有实现机械化，大量的农活还依靠手工操作的情况下，关键在于抓好劳动力。因为劳动力是搞好生产的物质基础和先决条件。抓劳动力要抓住三手：一是劳动出勤率；二是劳动力的合理使用；三是提高劳动效率。首先，从检查劳动出勤情况入手，看看直接投入生产的劳动力多和少，它是否体现了以农业为基础的方针。根据调查，生产好的先进小队投入田间生产的劳力都在75％以上；生产一般的小队投入田间生产的劳力在70％左右；生产搞的不好的落后队投入田间生产的劳力在60％左右。出勤少的原因：一是队上没搞好托儿工作，带小孩的妇女没有达到全部出勤；二是个别干部的家属不出勤；三是有外汇收入的富裕户，其中有些不爱劳动的人不出勤。为了保证出勤，要认真地解决实际问题和做好思想工作。例如对带孩子妇女的实际困难，队上要积极组织托儿所，帮助她们看好孩子；有关干部家属的问题，要对干部进行教育，解决干部闹特殊的思想；对不喜欢劳动的人，要进行爱劳动是最光荣的教育。总之，无论什么思想问题，都要认真地进行针锋相对的思想工作，把社员全发动起来，达到出全勤。其次，要合理使用劳动力。把劳力全发动起来了，还必须合理使用。怎么算使用得合理呢？一是把主要力量用到生产最关键的农活上，用到最需要的地方去；二是不要出现窝工和浪费工的现象，要弄清有多少活，哪一样活用多少人，用什么样的人，做到人尽其才，按人定活，支配得科学合理。比如，当前正在搞三秋工作，三秋工作种麦是中心，应当把劳力集中用于种麦子，保证多种、种早、种好。如果因秋收不完，腾不出茬来，就可先突击秋收，或者把劳力适当的划分成几个组，有管收的，有管种的，边收边种。但是，还必须注意各组之间的结合，防止出现忙闲不均。第三是提高劳动效率。提高劳动效率的方法，首先是坚持政治挂帅，加强思想教育，继续鼓足革命干劲。先进思想是鼓舞劳动热情的动力。同样的工具，由思想觉悟不同的人去使用，就会产生不同的劳动效率。这就说明，人的思想是决定的条件。为了做好思想工作，除了一般的社会主义教育外，无论作什么活，都要叫社员明白作这个活的目的和意义，他们知道了，干着才有劲。安排活也要具体，谁干什么活，带什么工具，都要事前向社员交代清楚。其次，加强劳动管理，执行劳动定额，要建立与健全劳动组织。根据生产需要，照顾个人的专长，合理的把劳力编成若干个作业小组，并建立生产责任制度，做到任务具体、责任明确、报酬合理。还要认真地搞好劳动定额。搞定额有两个意思：一是按人规定出劳动任务，必须保证完成，按照完成的质量，付给工分报酬；再是超额要有奖励，多劳多得。只有这样，才能调动广大社员的生产积极性；第三是解决好工具问题。工欲善其事，必先利其器。使用的工具不同，劳动效率也不同。往地里送粪，两个人抬一筐，与一个人用小车推两筐，工效就差三倍。很多事实证明，改革工具是提高劳动效率的关键环节；第四是抓操作规程。搞好操作规程，排好作活的顺序就是巧干，它对提高效率关系很大。比如浇水，必须先平整好土地，搞好畦田工程，测量好地平线，确定好水由那来，再放水浇地，就会浇的快、浇的好。如果有一手搞的不好，虽然费了劲，还浇个乱七八糟；第五是注意劳逸结合，照顾和帮助社员解决切身利益问题，处处关心社员，帮助他们解决困难，也是激发社员生产积极性、提高劳动效率的重要环节。
    抓生活主要是办好食堂。办好食堂是非常重要的，因为生活搞不好，就会影响生产、就会妨碍人身健康。办好食堂的关键，在于干部吃食堂、干部办食堂，贫、下中农积极分子管食堂。我们抓生活首先要抓干部，抓干部是不是吃食堂，吃食堂是不是与社员吃同样、同量的饭。这个问题很重要，因为只有干部和社员吃一样的饭了，他才会知道有没有问题，管着才会积极，解决问题才会彻底。同时，要检查什么人办食堂，什么人当着食堂的家？是贫、下中农积极分子呢？还是富裕中农当家，或是地、富、反、坏分子当家？找好食堂的当家人是办好食堂的重要环节。因为农村公共食堂是社会主义在农村的阵地，也是共产主义的萌芽。因此，就要使食堂掌握在最可靠的人手里，由贫、下中农来当家。为什么非叫贫、下中农当家呢？因为他们在旧社会里最受压迫，痛苦最深，革命也最坚决。他们的阶级觉悟较高，听党的话，特别拥护人民公社和公共食堂。他们不但思想好，而且还有勤劳、节俭的好风格，会过日子，也会把富日子当穷日子过。食堂的家只有叫他们当，才能够当好。在解决好以上两个问题的前提下，还要抓好计划用粮、节约用粮，贯彻以人定量、指标到户、凭票吃饭、节约归己的政策；大搞家底生产，种好菜，多养猪，让社员吃饱、吃好。同时，还要注意搞好食堂管理，定期公布账目，发动群众办好食堂。
    作好“人”的工作
    干部深入到小队以后，除了搞好关键性的任务以外，还要抓好“人”的组织发动和思想工作。抓的对象有两个：一是培养提高基层干部；一是调动群众积极性，大搞群众运动。小队干部是党同群众联系的桥梁，是党的路线、方针、政策的具体执行者。党要通过他们把群众的意见集中起来，作为制定路线、方针、政策的依据。党要把正确的路线、方针、政策正确地贯彻到群众中去，又需要他们在群众中经常地进行深入细致的思想工作和组织工作。小队干部又是人民群众的生产、生活的直接领导者和组织者。他们既要领导好小队的生产，又要组织好几百人的生活。因此，大力培养提高小队干部的政治思想水平和业务工作能力，是每一个到小队去工作的同志的义不容辞的政治任务。
    培养小队干部的方法要掌握三结合：（1）加强思想教育与个人模范行动相结合：首先，对小队干部要加强政治挂帅，进行思想教育，提高他们的思想觉悟，加强政策观念。同时，个人必须严格的要求自己，一言一行都要起模范作用，处处都要按党的政策、党的要求办事，做工作要扎扎实实、实事求是，作风要艰苦朴素，要勇于克服困难，并团结好群众，在群众之中，有事和群众商量，处处以身作则，以实际行动去教育和影响他们；（2）当好参谋与大胆使用相结合。到小队去工作是当小队干部的参谋，不是包办代替他们的工作。当参谋是帮助他们提高思想水平和政策水平，提高他们对实际问题的分析能力，帮助出主意、想办法，提高领导水平，帮助他们把工作做好。在实际工作中，要大胆放手的让他们去工作，使他们敢于大胆负责，不断地提高工作能力，积极完成党的任务；（3）教育提高干部与体贴干部困难相结合。积极地教育提高小队干部的思想水平，使他们树立舍己为公，全心全意为人民服务的思想。但是，在某些实际问题上，必须体贴干部的实际困难，注意帮助解决他们的实际困难，使他们处处感到党对他的温暖，永远保持革命热情。
    要想把广大群众发动起来，必须到群众中去。最重要的是和他们一起劳动和生活，同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，一点也不特殊，和他们完全打成一片，成为真正的知心朋友，这是做好群众工作的基础。调动群众的生产积极性，还必须掌握“三结合”的方法：（1）加强思想教育与联系实际相结合。对群众进行思想教育必须联系实际，用事实教育，用算账、回忆、对比的方法是最有效的教育方法。比如在种麦工作中，向社员先讲种麦子要多种种好，多种种好有哪些好处，就不如通过总结今年种麦的经验去教育社员，使社员自觉的积极起来种好麦子；（2）发动群众与解决问题相结合。把群众发动起来了，都投入田间参加生产了，必须注意解决他们的实际问题，才能把群众的积极性保持经常。如妇女做衣服、照顾孩子等等，这都是实际问题，必须妥善的解决，解决不好就会出现下地带针线或者不出勤。更重要的是不解决群众的实际问题，就会招致群众的不满，影响生产情绪；（3）宣传政策与体现政策相结合。要及时地把党的各项政策向群众作宣传，使政策和群众见面。这一条比较容易做到，但更重要的是必须按党的政策办事，体现政策。如果光宣传政策，不执行政策，就会降低党的政策在群众中的威信，就会严重的影响群众生产积极性。如做好了这三个结合，就会最大限度的调动起群众的生产积极性来。
