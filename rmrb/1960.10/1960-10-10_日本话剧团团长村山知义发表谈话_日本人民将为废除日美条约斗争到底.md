    Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: Tomoyoshi Murayama, the leader of the Japanese Theater Troupe, said in an interview with Xinhua reporters in Beijing yesterday: "We will continue to fight until the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is abolished."

    Murayama said that the Japanese Diet will hold a general election in early November, and the Japanese people will launch a struggle to prevent those who support the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" from being elected.

    Murayama Tomoyoshi, who visited China in 1957, said when talking about his impressions of this visit this year, "China has made rapid progress in all aspects. The slogan of the General Line has been well implemented in all aspects."

    Murayama Tomoyoshi praised the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, saying that many art forms have developed under this policy. Drama and politics are closely integrated, and great achievements have been made. The policy of serving workers, peasants and soldiers in literature and art has been further implemented. Murayama Tomoyoshi emphasized that workers and peasants are the source of literature and art, and literary and art workers cannot understand the demands of workers and peasants if they do not go to the workers and peasants themselves. Murayama Tomoyoshi said that after the members of the Japanese Theater Troupe came to China, "they saw the development of Chinese drama and other Chinese arts, and realized that Chinese art is truly art for the people." Murayama Tomoyoshi also mentioned that more than 70 foreign guests from various countries participated in the Chinese National Day celebration this year, which is much more than in 1957. This shows that China is uniting with more and more peace-loving people from all over the world.

    Murayama Tomoyoshi said that the Japanese Theater Troupe came to China this time not only to introduce the art of the Japanese people and learn from each other in art, but also to join hands with Chinese friends to fight against the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people - U.S. imperialism. He said that the joint statement signed by several Japanese visiting groups and Chinese groups has formulated more frequent exchanges and closer cooperation between Chinese and Japanese artists in the future.

    日本话剧团团长村山知义发表谈话
    日本人民将为废除日美条约斗争到底
    新华社9日讯　日本话剧团团长村山知义昨天在北京接见新华社记者时说：“我们将要一直斗争下去直到日美安全条约被废除为止。”
    村山知义说，11月初日本国会将举行总选举，日本人民将要展开斗争，使赞成“日美安全条约”的人不能当选。
    村山知义曾在1957年访问过中国，谈到今年这次访问的印象时，他说，“中国在各方面有了飞跃的发展。总路线这个口号在各方面贯彻得很好。”
    村山知义赞扬了百花齐放百家争鸣的政策，他说，许多文艺形式在这个政策下得到发展。戏剧和政治密切结合，取得了很大的成绩。文艺为工农兵服务的方针得到了进一步贯彻。村山知义强调说，工农是文艺的源泉，文艺工作者如果不亲身到工农中去，就不能体会到工农的要求。村山知义说，日本话剧团成员来到中国后，“看到了中国戏剧和中国其他艺术的发展，并认识到中国的艺术是真正的为人民的艺术”。村山知义还谈到今年有七十多个国家的外宾参加中国国庆典礼，比1957年多很多。这说明中国和越来越多的全世界各国的爱好和平的人民团结在一起。
    村山知义说，日本话剧团这次来到中国，不只是为了介绍日本人民的艺术，并在艺术上互相学习；同时也是前来和中国朋友们携手，对中日两国人民共同的敌人——美帝国主义进行斗争。他说，日本几个访华团体和中国团体签订的共同声明，拟定了今后中日艺术家之间的更频繁的交往和紧密合作。
