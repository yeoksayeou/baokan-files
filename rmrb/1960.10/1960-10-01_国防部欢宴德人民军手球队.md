Xinhua News Agency, 29th - The Ministry of National Defense held a banquet tonight to welcome Lieutenant Colonel Mueck, the leader of the German Democratic Republic's National People's Army Handball Team, and all its members.

General Gan Siqi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended a warm welcome to all members of the German Democratic Republic's National People's Army Handball Team, headed by Lieutenant Colonel Mueck. He said at the banquet that the people and armies of China and Germany have a long-standing, fraternal, and profound friendship. Under the banner of glorious Marxism-Leninism, we have always supported each other and advanced side by side. The friendly visit of the German Democratic Republic's National People's Army Handball Team to our country will undoubtedly make new contributions to the further development of this fraternal friendship.

General Gan Siqi said that both of our countries are now engaged in large-scale socialist construction and have already achieved great success. Our two fraternal forces will, along with the development of socialist construction, further accelerate the improvement of our combat effectiveness, and make greater contributions in the glorious struggle to safeguard the security of our respective motherlands, to combat imperialist aggression and war conspiracies, and to defend world peace.

Lieutenant Colonel Mueck, the leader of the German Democratic Republic's National People's Army Handball Team, said at the banquet that there are many good ties that connect our two countries together. I believe that our visit to your great country will make a greater contribution to our friendship. Our two countries are fighting for common goals in the big family of the socialist camp. Our two countries stand on the eastern and western outposts of the socialist camp, defending the socialist cause, so strengthening the friendship between us is of great significance for consolidating the socialist camp and the friendship between the two countries.

Lieutenant Colonel Mueck said that we firmly believe that we will get the full support of your country and people in the struggle against West German militarism. His speech was greeted with warm applause.
