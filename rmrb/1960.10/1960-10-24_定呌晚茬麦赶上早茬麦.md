    Strive for Late Wheat to Catch Up with Early Wheat
    By our reporters Ma Ming and Wu Zanting
    One day in mid-October, we traversed the Jinzhong Plain and arrived at the Shahe People's Commune at the foot of Phoenix Mountain in Taigu County. We saw that a surge of activity to rush-plant late wheat was underway here.
    In the commune's vast fields, wheat planting shock brigades and autumn harvesting teams clearing the fields for wheat planting were working in adjacent fields, engaging in a competition. On one side, groups of autumn harvesting teams were still swinging scythes to harvest mature autumn crops, plowing and harrowing the land; on the other side, wheat planting shock brigades were already shouting and driving teams of livestock on newly opened work surfaces, digging ditches and sowing seeds. Groups of people and vehicles repairing the ridges and transporting fertilizer were also busily coming and going. Yesterday, this was still drooping, blushing millet and sorghum waiting to be harvested; today, neat wheat ridges have already appeared. And in the early-planted wheat fields, the emerging seedlings are already a lush green.
    
    Don't Let Third-Class Fields Hold Us Back
    Liu Linkui, the deputy secretary of the Taoyuanbao Management District Party Branch, is a well-known "wise man" in the commune. These days, he has been giving a lot of thought to how to plant this year's returning and late wheat well. This management district has to complete a late wheat planting task that is double last year's, and it can only plant wheat after harvesting the autumn crops. The farm work and labor are indeed very tight. However, in Liu Linkui's view, as long as the autumn harvest clearing and wheat planting are arranged well, and two teams are organized for shock work, the problem is relatively easy to solve. He also feels that the saying "late wheat yields must be lower than early wheat" is untenable. He thinks: if we eliminate third-class seedlings during and before the sowing period, and add careful management, late wheat can catch up with early wheat. Therefore, he is determined: to break with convention and strive for increased production in every wheat field, we must first give "preferential treatment" to the remote and low-yielding fields that account for a large proportion of the wheat fields, so that they can "sit on an equal footing" with the nearby, high-yielding fields.
    Just then, he heard that the Guanjabao Production Team of the Nanguang Management District had created experience in low-yielding fields catching up with high-yielding fields, so he went to seek "expertise" and obtain "treasure." After returning, he traveled to every production team in the management district to transmit the "expertise" and deliver the "treasure," and also participated in creating a pilot field in the Fourth Production Team. This hundred-mu remote dry land used to receive very little fertilizer in the past. This time, not only was sufficient high-quality fertilizer applied, but also after raising the low and leveling the high, it was carefully leveled, expanding the planting area and also allowing for irrigation.
    The Fourth Production Team's transformation of low-yielding fields quickly spread throughout the entire management district. The members of the First Production Team also issued a vow to "resolutely not let third-class seedlings hold us back." The young men of the land processing shock brigade of this team, in one go, leveled and replenished three uneven late wheat fields that were inconvenient for watering, processing and fertilizing them very carefully. The Second, Third, and Fifth Teams, which were conducting a competition against each other in the same team, also quickly caught up, learning from the Fourth Team and catching up with the First Team, making the effort a hotbed of activity. When we visited the early-planted late wheat fields of these teams, rows of newly emerging tender green seedlings were competing to grow in the flat wheat ridges. On the bumper harvest signs inserted at the edge of the fields, new names were written in large characters for these original "thin lands": "Treasure Bowl," "Gold Scraping Board," "Golden Hole."
    
    People Who Walk in Front
    In the Party Committee office of the commune, we saw the good news that the Wujiazhuang Production Team of the Nanguang Management District had completed its wheat planting plan ahead of schedule. But when we arrived at Wujiazhuang, the members here had already begun preparing for winter watering of the wheat fields.
    "Not to plant an acre of Cold Dew wheat." This is the bold statement made by the Wujiazhuang Production Team to ensure timely sowing. Two-thirds of the four hundred and ten mu of wheat planted by this production team is returning wheat. Under the conditions of a large planting task and short time, not only was timely sowing guaranteed, but also every wheat field achieved high quality and high standards of sowing. Before sowing, Zhao Shiai, the young female team leader, discovered that the 270 mu of late wheat fields were still half lacking in fertilizer according to the plan. She raised this issue to everyone, and carefully inspected the homes of the members door-to-door, seeing that many outhouses still had accumulated manure residue. She rolled up her trousers and jumped into the outhouse, wielding a shovel to dig out the manure residue. Her actions inspired all the female team members. From morning to night, they used only one day to dig out more than 5,000 dan of manure residue from more than 30 outhouses, so that every mu of late wheat reached the same amount of fertilizer as the regular wheat.

    "Old Technology" Competition
    In the wheat planting shock brigade of the Fourth Production Team of the Houcheng Management District, there are three "old technologies," one is Wang Suogui, a 53-year-old "plowing expert," and the other two are Wang Mingxing and Yang Qigui, who are good at sowing seeds. Wang Suogui drove the livestock to the ground as soon as it was light. Others plowed five mu a day, but he plowed six mu, and the soil was finely and evenly crushed. One day, he found that insufficient animal power was affecting the progress of wheat planting, so he suggested to the team leaders to use manpower to harrow the land, freeing up the harrowing livestock for rush planting.
    Wang Mingxing and Yang Qigui often sow seeds in the same piece of land. They are quick and even, and they have a set of experiences on how much seed is needed for what kind of land, and what kind of variety is suitable for planting. One day, Wang Mingxing challenged Lao Yang: "The wheat I plant has a sowing width of four inches per furrow, and I guarantee it will be even. How about you?" Yang Qigui replied: "Compare it after emergence. When the wheat is harvested next year, if it doesn't increase by one jin, it will increase by two." From then on, the two competed without letting up.

    定呌晚茬麦赶上早茬麦
    本报记者　马明　武赞庭
    十月中的一天，我们穿过晋中平原，来到太谷县凤凰山下的沙河人民公社，看到这里正掀起了抢种晚茬麦的热潮。
    在公社的宽阔田野里，一个个种麦突击队，和为种麦腾茬的秋收队，正在毗邻相接的田间交叉作业，展开竞赛。这边，成群的秋收队，还在挥镰抢收秋熟庄稼，犁地、耙地；那边，种麦突击队，已经在新开辟的工作面上吆喝着一犋犋牲口，开沟下种。整修畦田、运送肥料的人群和车辆，也在来往地忙碌着。昨天，这里还是低头、红脸的谷子、高粱在等人收割；今天，整齐的小麦畦田已经出现。而在早种的麦田里，出土的幼苗，已是一片葱绿。
    不让三类田扯腿
    桃园堡管理区党支部副书记刘林魁，是全社出名的“智多星”。这些天，他为种好今年的回茬、晚茬麦，考虑得很多。这个管理区要完成播种比去年增加一倍的晚茬麦任务，而且收了秋才能种麦，农活、劳力确实够紧了。可是，在刘林魁看来，只要做好秋收腾茬和种麦的安排，组织两支队伍突击，问题是比较容易解决的。他还觉得“晚茬麦产量一定比早茬麦低”的说法，是站不住脚的。他想：如果把三类苗消灭在播种期和播种以前，再加上精细管理，晚茬麦是可以赶上早茬麦的。于是，他下定决心：要打破常规，争取块块麦田增产，就要先给占麦田较大比例的远地、低产田“吃偏饭”，让他们和近地、高产田“平起平坐”。
    正在这时，他听说南洸管理区关家堡生产队创造了低产田赶高产田的经验，便前去求“经”取“宝”。回来后，他为传“经”送“宝”，走遍了管理区各个生产队，还在第四生产队参加搞了一片试验田。这片百亩远旱地，往年很少施肥，这次不但上足了优质肥料，而且经过起高垫低，细致地平整，扩大了播种面积，还可以引水灌溉。
    第四生产队改造低产田的事，很快传遍了全管理区。第一生产队的社员们也发出了“坚决不让三类苗拉后腿”的誓言。这个队的土地加工突击队的小伙子们，一鼓作气，把三块高低不平、不便浇水的晚茬麦地垫平补齐，加工加肥，耕耙的很细致。同一队开展对手赛的二队、三队、五队，也急起直追，学四队赶一队，搞得热火朝天。当我们参观这些队早种的晚茬麦地时，平坦的小麦畦田里，一行行刚出土的嫩绿幼苗，正在竞长。地边插着的丰产牌上，用大字给这些原来的“薄地”写上了新的名字：“聚宝盆”、“刮金板”、“金圪洞”。
    走在前面的人
    我们在公社党委会办公室里，看到了南洸管理区吴家庄生产队提前完成种麦计划的喜报。可是当我们赶到吴家庄的时候，这里的社员们已经开始着手为麦田冬浇作准备了。
    “不种一亩寒露麦”。这是吴家庄生产队为保证适时播种发出的豪言壮语。这个生产队播种的四百一十亩小麦，有三分之二是回茬麦，在种麦任务大、时间短的情况下，不但保证适时下种，而且达到了块块麦田播种高质量高标准。播种前，年轻的女队长赵世爱，发现二百七十亩晚茬麦田按计划还缺少一半肥料。她把这个问题向大家提出来，自己又挨门逐户地到社员家仔细观看，看到许多茅坑里还积存有粪渣。她便卷起裤腿，跳进茅坑，挥锨挖掘粪渣。她的这一行动，激励了全体女队员。她们从早到晚，只用了一天时间，就在三十多个粪坑内，挖出粪渣五千多担，使每亩晚茬麦都达到了和正茬麦同样多的肥料。
    “老技术”竞赛
    在候城管理区第四生产队种麦突击队里，有三个“老技术”，一个是五十三岁的“犁地能手”王锁贵，另两个是善长撒籽的王明兴和杨启贵。王锁贵天刚发亮，就赶着牲口上地，别人一天耕五亩，他耕六亩，碎土又细又匀。有一天，他发现畜力不足影响种麦进度，于是向队的领导干部提出了用人力耙地的建议，把耙地的牲口腾出来抢种。
    王明兴和杨启贵，常在一块地撒籽，他们出手快，撒得匀，什么样的地需要多少种籽，适宜种那种品种，都有一套经验。一天，王明兴向老杨提出挑战：“我种的麦每垅播幅四寸，保证均匀。你呢？”杨启贵回答说：“出土后比比看，明年麦收的时候，不比你增斤，也能增两。”从此，两个人就一着不让地比赛开了。
