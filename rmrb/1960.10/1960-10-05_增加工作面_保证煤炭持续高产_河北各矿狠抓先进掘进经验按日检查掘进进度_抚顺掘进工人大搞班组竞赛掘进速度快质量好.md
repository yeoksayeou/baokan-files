Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Telegram: The staff and workers of large and medium-sized coal mines in Hebei Province are actively preparing for production in the fourth quarter while greatly increasing the production of raw coal, providing material conditions for working hard for ninety days and ensuring the completion of the annual production plan.

These coal mines conscientiously implemented the production policy of "grasping both coal mining and tunneling." Leaders at all mines, such as party committee secretaries and mine directors, are responsible for tunneling, adhering to monthly, weekly, and daily planning, and checking the completion status daily, weekly, and monthly, to ensure the timely completion of key production preparation projects. All mines vigorously tapped the internal personnel potential of enterprises and strengthened the front line of production. Since mid-August alone, major coal mines such as Kailuan, Fengfeng, and Jingxing have drawn more than 2,200 on-ground employees from within their enterprises to strengthen underground work and enhance tunneling. Due to the strengthening of tunneling work, the amount of coal reserves in major coal mines throughout the province has reached more than five months.

In strengthening tunneling work, all mines fully mobilized the masses, launched competitions, promoted advanced experiences, and accelerated the tunneling progress. The tunneling workers of Kailuan Coal Mine launched a "three comparisons" red flag competition centered on promoting advanced experience, comparing tunneling speed, comparing efficiency, and comparing quality, comprehensively promoting the advanced experiences of Ren Guangjin and Li Changliang, such as double electric drill drilling, deep-hole blasting, and four parallel operations, effectively improving the tunneling level.

The electromechanical maintenance workers of various coal mines are also actively carrying out the maintenance and overhaul of electromechanical equipment to prepare for production in the fourth quarter. Seven large and medium-sized mines, including Kailuan, Jingxing, and Handan, overhauled major equipment and roadways on schedule in September.

Xinhua News Agency, Fushun Telegram: Tunneling workers from Fushun Longfeng Mine, Shengli Mine, and Laohutai Mine launched a team competition to accelerate tunneling progress, ensuring that they create more favorable conditions for the sustained leap forward in coal production.

Each team in the Laohutai Mine's underground engineering team launched a competition to "see who creates more favorable conditions for the next shift." All teams in the entire team accelerated their progress in every shift. The tunneling progress of the entire team in September increased by more than 34% compared to August. The Longfeng Mine's underground district launched a competition to "advance one hundred meters per day." Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch, Teng Zizhu, led the cadres of the entire district to go deep into the underground tunneling teams, going down the well with the workers, going up the well, working together, and tackling key problems together, so that the tunneling progress of the entire district quickly increased from the original fifty meters per day to more than eighty meters.

While accelerating tunneling progress, all mines have also improved tunneling quality to ensure that every meter tunneled is effective. Under the guidance of the idea of "quality first," the staff and workers of the Shengli Mine's underground district universally implemented the "three no-acceptance" system, namely: shelves that do not meet specifications are not accepted, the working face is not cleaned of floating coal is not accepted, and the center level of the working face is not straightened is not accepted. After the implementation of this system, the qualification rate of tunneling has generally reached more than 90%.

In order to further strengthen tunneling leadership, all coal mines, in accordance with the instructions of the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, recently established new mining area handover offices, striving for initiative in everything, grasping competitions in every shift, and grasping balance every day, ensuring that new mining areas are handed over for production on schedule.

The 304th tunneling team of the 7th Pit of the Haizhou Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau in Liaoning Province, while continuously increasing output, has also formulated a convention to ensure quality, carefully planning in advance and carefully checking afterward to achieve one-time roadway formation with high speed and high quality. This is the inspection team carrying out handover acceptance.

    增加工作面　保证煤炭持续高产
    河北各矿狠抓先进掘进经验按日检查掘进进度
    抚顺掘进工人大搞班组竞赛掘进速度快质量好
    据新华社天津电　河北省大中型煤矿的职工，在大量增产原煤的同时，积极作好第四季度生产准备工作，为大干九十天，保证完成全年生产计划，提供了物质条件。
    这些煤矿认真贯彻了“采煤、掘进”两手抓的生产方针。各个矿都由党委书记、矿长等领导干部负责抓掘进，坚持按月、按周、按日安排计划，按日、按周、按月检查完成情况，保证了重点生产准备项目的如期完成。各矿大力挖掘企业内部人员潜力，加强生产第一线。仅8月中旬以来，开滦、峰峰、井陉等各大煤矿，就从企业内部抽出二千二百多名井上职工，充实井下，加强了掘进工作。由于掘进工作的加强，全省各大煤矿的获得煤量达到五个月以上。
    各矿在加强掘进工作中，充分发动群众，开展竞赛，推广先进经验，加快掘进进度。开滦煤矿的掘进工人掀起了以推广先进经验为中心的比掘进速度快、比效率高、比质量好的“三比”红旗竞赛，全面推广任广金、李长亮的双电钻打眼、深孔爆破、四平行作业等先进经验，有效地提高了掘进水平。
    各煤矿的机电维修工人，也积极为第四季度的生产做好机电设备维护检修工作。开滦、井陉、邯郸等七个大中型矿井，在9月份按期检修了主要设备和巷道。
    据新华社抚顺电　抚顺龙凤矿、胜利矿和老虎台矿掘进工人展开了加快掘进进度的班组竞赛，保证为煤炭生产持续大跃进创造更为有利的条件。
    老虎台矿井巷工程队各小组互相展开“看谁为下一个班创造的有利条件多”的竞赛，全队班班都加快进度，全队掘进9月份进度比8月份提高34％以上。龙凤矿井巷区展开了“日进百米”的竞赛。党总支副书记塍子柱带领全区干部深入井下各掘进小组，跟工人同下井、同升井、同劳动、同攻关键，使全区掘进进度很快由原来的日进五十米提高到八十米以上。
    在加快掘进进度的同时，各矿都更好地提高了掘进质量，保证掘进一米、有效一米。胜利矿井巷区职工在“质量第一”的思想指导下，普遍推行了“三不验”的制度，即：棚子不合规格不验收，掌子头浮煤扫不净不验收，掌子面中心水平拉不直不验收。推行这一制度之后，掘进合格率普遍达到了90％以上。
    为了进一步加强掘进领导，各煤矿都根据中共抚顺市委的指示，在最近成立了新采区移交办公室，本着事事争主动的精神，班班抓竞赛，天天抓平衡，保证新采区按期移交生产。（附图片）
    辽宁阜新矿务局海州矿七坑三○四掘进队，在不断提高产量的同时，又订出保证质量的公约，事先周密计划，事后认真检查，做到一次成巷，速度快质量高。这是检查小组正在进行交接验收
