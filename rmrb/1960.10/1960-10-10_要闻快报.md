    Fujian Strengthens Late-Stage Sugarcane Field Management
    People's communes in sugarcane-producing areas of Fujian are seizing the current peak sugarcane growth period to launch a mass-based late-stage sugarcane field management campaign centered on topdressing and soil cultivation. To date, most sugarcane fields across the province have been topdressed and cultivated with soil once, and sugarcane is generally growing well. In Pinghe County, one of the major producing areas, after the third weeding, topdressing, and soil cultivation, the percentage of first and second-class sugarcane seedlings has increased from 82% to over 90%.
    In the midst of vigorous late-stage sugarcane field management, communes in various sugarcane areas are also carrying out a fertilizer accumulation campaign combining specialized teams and mass mobilization, accumulating and creating large quantities of human and animal manure, local fertilizer, and mixed fertilizer. Relevant departments have also allocated more than 10 million jin of special sugarcane fertilizer to meet the needs of late-stage sugarcane topdressing.
    Tianjin Suburbs Prevent and Control Autumn Vegetable Diseases and Pests
    Districts in Tianjin City, Hebei Province, are drawing on their strength to mobilize the masses, strengthen field management of autumn vegetables, and launch a concentrated effort to prevent and control diseases and pests in vegetable fields near the suburbs. Nankai District has launched a concentrated week of disease and pest control. Hedong District has drawn 1,300 cadres from government offices to manage autumn vegetables and prevent diseases in designated areas together with commune members, and has achieved good results.
    In the work of preventing and controlling diseases and pests, many areas have also established technical research and guidance organizations and held training classes to improve work efficiency and quality.
    Southern Anhui Mountain Areas Rush to Harvest Wild Plants
    People's communes in the mountainous areas of southern Anhui Province and the Dabie Mountains are seizing the opportunity to organize labor to go up to the high mountains and into the dense forests to carry out a massive "small autumn harvest" campaign, striving to harvest both the major autumn crops and the minor autumn crops completely and meticulously. By the end of September, the Lu'an Special Zone in the Dabie Mountains had collected more than 4.51 million jin of wild starch, fiber, oil, and medicinal materials; She County in the mountainous area of southern Anhui, where wild plants mature earlier, had collected 43.85 million jin of various wild plants, and has processed them in a timely manner.
    In carrying out the "small autumn harvest" campaign, commercial, grain, and medicinal materials departments in various places have closely cooperated to process and purchase wild plants in a timely manner.
    Carefully Harvest Disaster-Stricken Crops
    Chengfa Management Area of Chengfa People's Commune in Yushu County, Jilin Province, cadres and commune members are working hard, not afraid of labor, and not afraid of trouble, carefully harvesting disaster-stricken crops, resolutely ensuring that every grain is harvested, and if there are no grains, the stalks are harvested, striving to get every grain into the granary and every stalk into the field.
    The Chengfa Management Area is located in a low-lying area, and all crops were flooded this summer due to heavy rainfall. At that time, after cadres and commune members worked hard to rescue, process, fertilize, and take measures, most of the crops basically recovered to normal growth. However, some crops still suffered reduced yields. Now, various crops are ripening one after another, and in order to strive to reduce losses and get more grain during the autumn harvest, the Party branch of the management area recently formed crop maturity identification and inspection teams, with each production team as a unit, to go deep into the fields and inspect and rank the crops plot by plot, arranging the harvesting order according to the maturity time of the disaster-stricken crops, and determining harvesting measures.

Each of them herds forty female yaks. From conception in September of last year to July of this year, each herd produced forty-four calves, not only did every yak produce a calf, but four yaks in each herd gave birth to twins, with a reproduction survival rate of 110%.

    要闻快报
    福建加强蔗园后期管理
    福建各产蔗地区人民公社，抓紧当前甘蔗盛长时期，开展群众性的以追肥培土为中心的蔗田后期管理运动。到目前止，全省大部分蔗园都已增施追肥、培土一次，甘蔗普遍生长良好。主要产区之一的平和县所有蔗园在经过第三次除草追肥和培土后，一、二类蔗苗已从占百分之八十二增加到百分之九十以上。
    在大抓甘蔗后期田间管理中，各蔗区公社还开展专业队和群众性突击相结合的积肥运动，积、造了大量人畜粪肥、土肥和混合肥；有关部门也调拨了一千多万斤甘蔗专用化肥，供应甘蔗后期追肥需要。
    天津郊区防治秋菜病虫害
    河北省天津市各区抽调力量，发动群众，加强秋菜田间管理，突击防治近郊菜田的病虫害。南开区开展了防治病虫害突击周。河东区抽调了一千三百名机关干部，分片包干，和社员一起管理秋菜，防治病害，已取得了良好效果。
    在防治病虫害工作中，为了提高工作效率和工作质量，不少地区还成立了技术研究指导组织，举办了训练班。
    皖南山区抢收野生植物
    安徽省皖南山区和大别山区各人民公社抓紧时机组织劳动力上高山、入密林，开展声势浩大的“小秋收”运动，力争大秋、小秋都收全收细。到九月下旬，大别山区的六安专区已采集野生淀粉、纤维、油脂、药材等四百五十一万多斤；野生植物成熟期较早的皖南山区的歙县，已采集各种野生植物四千三百八十五万多斤，并已及时加工。

    精收细打受灾作物
    吉林省榆树县城发人民公社城发管理区，干部和社员大鼓干劲、不怕费工、不嫌费事，精收细打受灾作物，坚决作到有粒收粒，无粒收棵，力争粒粒归仓，棵棵上场。
    城发管理区地势较洼，今年夏季因雨水较大，庄稼全部遭水淹。当时，经干部和社员奋力抢救、加工、加肥、加措施，绝大部分庄稼基本恢复了正常生育。但是，仍有部分庄稼减产。现在，各种作物陆续成熟，管理区党支部为了力争受灾少减产，在秋收中多拿到一些粮食，最近，以各生产队为单位，组成作物成熟鉴定检查组，深入田间，逐块逐作物进行检查排队，按受灾作物成熟时间排出收割顺序，并定出收割措施。
