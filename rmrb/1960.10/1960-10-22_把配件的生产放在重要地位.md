Placing Importance on the Production of Accessories

Doing a good job in the production and supply of accessories is an important link in ensuring the normal operation of mechanical equipment. All factories and mines, while focusing on current production, must place the production and supply of accessories in an important position, so that mechanical equipment users always have a sufficient quantity and a complete variety of high-quality accessories, ensuring more effective improvement of equipment utilization and promoting sustained production increases.

Any kind of machinery and equipment is composed of many parts and components, and the parts and components of machinery and equipment will experience natural wear and tear, or unexpected failures and damage, during operation. When the parts and components of a machine wear to a certain extent, or encounter unexpected damage, new parts and components are needed to replace them. Therefore, producing and supplying accessories according to the wear and tear of parts and components is a regular task for mechanical manufacturing departments and mechanical equipment using departments. In the continuous Great Leap Forward of the past two years, the production and supply of accessories, like the production and supply of mechanical equipment, have achieved great results. However, compared with actual needs, there is still a certain gap. On the one hand, this is due to the continuous development of the national economy, and the number of various machines is increasing. For example, metallurgical equipment increased sevenfold in 1958 compared with 1957, power station equipment increased threefold, and machine tool equipment also saw a large increase. On the other hand, in the continuous Great Leap Forward of the past two years, the utilization rate of various machinery and equipment has been increasing day by day. In addition, with the deepening of the increase production and practice economy movement and the substantial increase in the output of steel, iron, coal, minerals, transportation, and other industries, all aspects have put forward new requirements for further exerting the potential of machinery and equipment. In this way, the demand for accessories is also increasing, and the production and supply of accessories is becoming more and more important.

However, not everyone clearly recognizes the importance of accessory production. Some people believe that producing main engines is the most glorious and important thing, while producing accessories is playing a "supporting role," the work is fragmented, and the output value is low, so it is not as "cost-effective" as making main engines. Of course, producing main engines is very important. The country is carrying out large-scale economic construction, and it is urgently needed to produce a large number of high-quality, advanced, large-scale, precision, and cutting-edge machinery and equipment to equip all sectors of the national economy. However, accessories are necessary for any machine, and the machine cannot operate or cannot operate normally without them. Isn't its importance very clear? Therefore, producing accessories is equally glorious and important. Regarding the issue of cost-effectiveness, as long as we proceed from the overall interests of the country and calculate the overall account, the problem will be clear. If a machine and equipment cannot produce normally simply because it lacks certain parts, then, is it more cost-effective to repair the machine and equipment by making up some parts? Or is it more cost-effective to make a new machine? Obviously, making some parts is much more cost-effective than making a machine. Therefore, to correctly treat accessory production, we must proceed from the overall interests of the national economy and be willing to play a "supporting role."

Accessory production must be included in the plan and allocated the necessary materials. In particular, priority should be given to arranging the accessories needed to support agriculture, support coal, iron, minerals, and transportation, and allocate a certain amount of materials. When arranging monthly production plans, all enterprises responsible for producing accessories must include the accessories processed by their own factories and those entrusted to them by other factories, including the accessories required for the main engine products within the national plan, as well as the accessories required for local maintenance, except for those that can be solved by the users themselves, and arrange them uniformly, and incorporate them into the production plan, and submit the plan to the masses for discussion. It is particularly important to note here that which unit manufactures, when the goods will be delivered, where the raw materials come from, and who is responsible for each link must be clearly explained and implemented to the end. To do a good job in the production and supply of accessories, factories specializing in production certainly have a great responsibility; however, it is not enough to rely solely on specialized factories to undertake the supply of all accessories. We must mobilize the vast number of machine-using departments to work together, fully utilize and tap the capabilities of their own factories (including the ability to use scraps and other raw materials), manufacture accessories, and strive for self-sufficiency. In order to achieve this, all enterprises with mechanical repair capabilities must list the regular maintenance of equipment and the manufacture of accessories as the main tasks of the mechanical repair workshop (factory, group) of this enterprise. Only after completing this task and having surplus capacity can they transfer forces to engage in the manufacture of other products. Some enterprises that cannot manufacture accessories themselves should also report to the competent authorities as soon as possible, and carry out communist cooperation on a large scale within the province, city, collaboration zone, or the whole country, according to the principle of the whole country as a single chessboard; enterprises with strong technical and equipment capabilities should take the initiative to help enterprises with weak technical and equipment capabilities to establish small mechanical repair workshops or mechanical repair teams to produce some accessories and solve their own needs.

While vigorously increasing the production of accessories, all mechanical using departments must strictly implement the planned maintenance system for equipment. We must constantly educate employees to maintain machinery and equipment carefully with a highly responsible spirit, add oil and clean frequently, strictly abide by operating procedures, reduce the wear and tear of machine parts and components, reduce the number of parts and components replaced, save accessory consumption, and extend machine life.

The production and supply of accessories is not only a production and business issue, but also a leadership style and leadership method issue. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Be prepared, or regret." He also said, "Never fight unprepared battles." This means that everything must be well prepared. With sufficient preparation, we can work smoothly and hit wherever we point. The production of accessories is an important part of production preparation. It requires enterprise leaders to have the idea of comprehensively leading production, to grasp both current production and future preparation; and whether current production is good or not depends not only on current measures, but also on the preparatory work of the previous stage. Therefore, starting from improving leadership work to arrange the production and supply of accessories puts the enterprise's production in a proactive position of being fully prepared at all times.

Doing a good job in the production and supply of accessories is one of the important measures to promote greater growth in production in the fourth quarter and to prepare for next year's production. If each enterprise's machinery and equipment has the necessary accessories and sufficient reserve forces, it can achieve timely maintenance and timely replacement, ensuring a substantial increase in production. In short, seriously treating the production and supply of accessories is an important task with urgent significance in current production, and we should strive to do this work well.

### 把配件的生产放在重要地位

    把配件的生产放在重要地位
    做好配件的生产和供应工作，是保证机械设备正常运行的一个重要环节。所有厂矿企业，在大抓当前生产的同时，必须把配件的生产和供应工作放在重要地位，使机械使用单位经常保有数量充足、品种齐全的优质配件，保证更有效地提高设备利用率，促进生产的持续上升。
    任何一种机器设备，都是由许多部件和零件组成的，而机器设备的部件和零件在运转过程中，都会产生自然磨损，或是意外的故障和损坏；机器的零件和部件在磨损到一定的程度，或者遇到意外损坏的时候，就需要新的零件和部件来替换。因此，根据零件和部件的磨损情况，有计划地生产配件、供应配件，是机械制造部门和机械使用部门的一项经常工作。在连续两年多的大跃进中，配件的生产和供应，同机械设备的生产和供应一样，成绩都是很大的。但是，与实际需要相比，仍然存在着一定的距离。这一方面是由于国民经济的不断发展，各种机器的保有量愈来愈大。如冶金设备1958年比1957年增长了七倍，电站设备增长了三倍，机床设备也有了很大的增长。另一方面，在连续两年多的大跃进中，各种机器设备的利用率日益提高，加上增产节约运动的深入开展和钢、铁、煤、矿、运以及其它工业产量的大幅度增长，各方面对于进一步发挥机器设备潜力又提出了新的要求。这样，配件的需要量也就愈来愈大了，配件的生产和供应工作就更加重要了。
    但是，对于配件生产的重要性并不是所有的人都是认识很清楚的。有人认为，生产主机是最光荣、最重要的，而生产配件则是当个“配角”，工作既零碎，产值又低，不如作主机来得“合算”。生产主机当然十分重要，国家正在大规模地进行经济建设，生产数量多，质量好的高级的、大型的、精密的、尖端的机器设备，来装备国民经济各部门，这确是迫切需要的。然而，配件是任何一个机器所必需的，机器缺少了它就不能运转或不能正常运转，难道它的重要性不是很清楚的吗？因而生产配件同样是光荣的，重要的。关于合算不合算的问题，只要从国家的整体利益着眼，算一算大帐，问题就清楚了。如果有一台机器设备，只是因为缺少某一些零件而不能正常生产，那末，究竟是补上一些零件修好这一台机器设备合算？还是重新做一台机器合算？显然，做一些零件比做一台机器，要合算得多。所以，正确地对待配件生产，必须从国民经济的整个利益出发，甘愿当好“配角”。
    配件生产一定要纳入计划，分配必要的材料。特别要尽先安排支援农业、支援煤、铁、矿、运所需要的配件，配给一定数量的材料。所有负责生产配件的企业在安排每月生产计划的时候，要把本厂以及外厂委托加工的配件，包括国家计划内的主机产品配套所需的配件，以及当地维修所需的配件，除使用单位自行解决的以外，统一安排，一并纳入生产计划，并且把计划交给群众去讨论。这里值得特别注意的是，哪个单位制造，什么时候交货，原料材料由哪里来，各个环节上由哪些人负责，都要交代得清清楚楚，落实到底。做好配件的生产和供应，专业生产的厂子固然负有很大的责任；但是，单单依靠专业厂子担负所有配件的供应是不够的，必须动员广大机器使用部门，大家动手，充分利用和挖掘本厂的能力（包括利用边角余料等原料材料的能力），制造配件，争取自给。为了做到这一点，凡是有机械修理能力的企业，都必须把设备的经常维修和配件的制造，列为这个企业机修车间（厂、组）的主要任务。只有在完成了这项任务以后而确有余力的情况下，才可以转移力量去搞其它产品的制造。一些自己不能制造配件的企业，也应当早向主管部门汇报，在省、市、协作区或全国范围内，按照全国一盘棋的原则，大搞共产主义协作；技术、设备能力较强的企业，应当主动帮助技术设备力量较弱的企业，建立小型的机修车间或是机修小组，生产部分配件，解决自己的需要。
    在大力增产配件的同时，所有机械使用部门都要严格执行设备的计划检修制度。要经常教育职工用高度负责的精神，精心保养机器设备，勤加油、勤清洗，严格遵守操作规程，减少机器部件零件的磨损，减少更换零件部件的数量，节约配件消耗，延长机器寿命。
    配件的生产供应工作，不仅仅是生产业务问题，而且也是一个领导作风领导方法问题。毛泽东同志教导我们：凡事预则立，不预则废。又说，不打无准备之仗。这就是说，凡事都要作好准备，准备充分了，工作起来才得心应手，才能指到哪里打到哪里。配件的生产，是生产准备工作的重要部分。它要求企业领导人要有全面领导生产的思想，要既抓当前生产，也抓今后的准备工作；而当前生产好不好，既取决于当前的措施，也取决于前阶段的准备工作。因此，从改进领导工作着手来安排配件的生产和供应，就使企业的生产时时刻刻处于准备充分的主动地位。
    做好配件的生产供应，是促进第四季度生产更大增长和为明年生产作好准备的重要措施之一。每个企业的机械、设备有了必要的配件，有了充足的后备力量，就可以做到及时维修，及时更换，保证生产大幅度增长。总之，认真对待配件的生产和供应是当前生产上一项有迫切意义的重要工作，我们应当努力把这项工作切实做好。
