Xinhua News Agency, Paris, Electric dispatch. The French and West German authorities signed an agreement here on the 25th regarding the establishment of training and supply bases for West German troops in France.

    The French Foreign Ministry said that the specific equipment to be used by the West German troops and the number of West German troops entering France still need to be determined through further negotiations.

    However, it was revealed here that it has already been decided that the first batch of West German army troops, including 3,000 soldiers, will arrive in the Mormalon and Sissonne barracks near Reims, Marne, France, in early November for training lasting half a month or three weeks.

    The French public is extremely indignant that the German militarist forces, which have occupied their country twice in this century, are about to appear in France again. At a press conference held on the 20th, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry admitted that this sentiment among the French people is causing "technical" difficulties for the French government in selecting bases for West German troops.

    In Laon (Aisne), near which a West German base is planned to be established, the municipal council unanimously passed a resolution in an emergency meeting opposing the entry of West German troops.

    Resistance fighters and those exiled by Hitler held a mass rally at the Mutualité in Paris on the 19th to oppose the entry of West German troops into France. A resolution was passed at the meeting demanding that the government reject this plan, which violates the interests of France and the interests of peace.

    The National Federation of Reserve Officers and Sergeants of France and the French Veterans Federation have also issued statements protesting the arrival of West German troops in France. The statement by the National Federation of Reserve Officers and Sergeants condemns the French government for colluding with West German militarists and selling out national sovereignty.

    法政府出卖国家主权签署西德在法建立基地的协定
    法国公众抗议戴高乐引狼入室
    据新华社巴黎电　法国和西德当局25日在这里签订了关于在法国设立西德军队的训练和供应基地的协定。
    法国外交部说，关于西德军队使用的具体设备和进入法国的西德军队人数，还有待于进一步的谈判才能确定。
    但是这里透露，已经决定，包括三千名士兵的第一批西德陆军将在11月初到法国马恩省兰斯附近的摩默隆和西桑纳军营，作半个月或者三星期的训练。
    法国公众对曾经在本世纪内两次占领他们的国家的德国军国主义军队又要在法国出现一事，极为愤慨。法国外交部发言人在20日举行的一次记者招待会上承认，法国人民这种情绪使得法国政府在选择供西德军队用的基地的时候产生“技术上”的困难。
    在预定要在其附近设立西德基地的郎市（安纳省），市政委员会在紧急会议上一致通过决议，反对西德军队进驻。
    抵抗运动战士和被希特勒流放者19日在巴黎团结厅举行群众集会，反对西德军队进驻法国。会上通过决议，要求政府拒绝这个违反法国利益和和平利益的计划。
    法国后备役军官和军士全国联合会和法国退伍军人联合会也发表声明，抗议西德军队到法国来。后备役军官和军士全国联合会的声明谴责法国政府同西德军国主义者勾结和出卖国家主权。
