Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd: As the Chinese people warmly celebrate the successful signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, the Burmese Film Week, jointly organized by the Ministry of Culture, the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, grandly opened today at the Great Hall of the People in the capital. This adds even more joy to the people of the capital, who have been immersed in the festive atmosphere of the National Day and Sino-Burmese friendship in recent days.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Burmese guests Prime Minister U Nu and his wife, and General Ne Win and his wife attended the opening ceremony. When they appeared in the hall, warm applause resounded throughout the venue.

Also present at the opening ceremony were: Vice Premiers of the State Council Chen Yi and Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, and Bainqen Erdini Qoigyi Gyaincain, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Geng Biao, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Chu Tunan, Vice President of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association Zhao Puchu, Chinese Ambassador to Burma Li Yimang, and nearly seven hundred people from all walks of life in the capital.

Also attending the opening ceremony were Burmese guests in Beijing, as well as Burmese Ambassador to China Kyao Winn and his wife.

Envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries to China also attended the opening ceremony.

Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing delivered a speech at the opening ceremony, warmly congratulating the film week on its great success, and pointed out that this film week is a very important cultural event in the "Sino-Burmese Friendship Year" of 1960. This cultural activity is even more significant during this auspicious time shared by our two peoples. Shen Yanbing said that China and Burma are both great countries with long histories and cultures. In the past, both suffered from long-term imperialist aggression and oppression. Only after the two countries achieved independence and liberation was it possible to restore and develop their respective excellent historical and cultural traditions in the cultural field and strive to build their respective new national cultures. He said that China and Burma are close neighbors, and there is a traditional and profound friendship between the two peoples. After the governments of the two countries signed the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, the friendly relations between our two peoples, as close as "pauk-phaw" (siblings), will be further developed, and cultural exchanges between our two countries will inevitably become more frequent and increasingly developed. In his speech, Shen Yanbing also mentioned that the Chinese people love Burmese culture and art with its strong national characteristics. Burmese films such as "Life" and "Her Love" have been warmly welcomed by the Chinese people. Through these films, mutual understanding between the two peoples has been increased, and the friendship of the Chinese people for the Burmese people has been enhanced. He firmly believes that this film week will sow new seeds of friendship among the Chinese people. He wished that the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples will last forever.

U Soe U, Deputy Head of the Burmese Cultural Delegation, also spoke at the opening ceremony. He said that as the Chinese people celebrate the eleventh anniversary of their victorious founding of the nation and the successful signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, Burmese film workers are very happy to visit China as a friendly contingent and participate in the opening ceremony of the Burmese Film Week, which signifies a new bud and leaf on the tree of Sino-Burmese friendship. He said that the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples flows into a great river, and the ships of cultural art of the two countries will forever sail back and forth on this great river of friendship.

U Soe U also said that film art is a weapon for educating the masses. It is a most helpful weapon for advocating and educating for our common interests and ideals of peaceful coexistence, opposing imperialist war policies, establishing world peace, and striving for the liberation of the oppressed. He suggested that Burmese and Chinese film workers should cooperate closely.

In his speech, U Soe U wished the Chinese general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes new development, and wished Sino-Burmese friendship forever lasting.

At the opening ceremony, fourteen famous Burmese directors and actors, including U Tin Maung, U Kyaw Swe, U Tun Wai, Min Min Khin, and Khin Yu May, met with the audience and performed Burmese songs for the audience, which was warmly welcomed.
