British audiences' evaluations and reflections on Chinese films are: "They reflect the lives of the people and the direction they aspire to. You can see that the Chinese people are full of enthusiasm and energy"; "They reflect the feelings of the people; American movies are worthless in comparison"; "We hope you can make more films for us."
    
    (By our dispatch) The British Film Institute held a Chinese Film Festival at the National Film Theatre in London from August 23 to September 4. During the festival, twelve feature films, including "Lin Zexu," "The New Story of an Old Soldier," "Lotus Lamp," "The Storm," "Young People in Our Village," "Nie Er," "Five Golden Flowers," "Girl Basketball Player No. 5," "Spring and Autumn on the Water," "Youth in the Flames of War," "The Eternal Radio Wave," and "Joyfully Celebrating," as well as fourteen short films, including "Celebrating Ten Years," "Budding," and "On the Lhasa River," were screened.

    This was the first time that Britain had held a Chinese Film Festival. The festival received great attention from all sectors in Britain and was warmly welcomed by the audience. They gave high praise to the Chinese films. The British Film Institute believes that the film festival was a success, judging from the attendance and audience response. The screening results exceeded their expectations. They said that this film festival shows that the British people are eager to learn about New China, and they expressed the hope to hold another Chinese Film Festival in a year or two.

    The audience gave high praise to all the Chinese films. Mr. Foreman, manager of the British Plato Film Company, praised the great progress made in China's film industry in recent years. The British writer, Mr. Minney, believes that Chinese films "reflect the lives of the people and the direction they aspire to. From the films, you can see that the Chinese people are full of enthusiasm and energy." The wife of the black singer Robeson believes that Chinese films "reflect the feelings of the people; American movies are worthless in comparison." Audiences who watched "Celebrating Ten Years" unanimously praised it, believing that the film demonstrated the strength of the Chinese people and their achievements over the past decade.

    After watching "On the Lhasa River," one audience member wrote in the comments book: "I saw in the newspaper that the Chinese government is implementing a policy of exterminating the Tibetan people in Lhasa. After watching this film, I found that this is not the case. The Tibetan people are now living very happily." Some audience members said after watching "Lin Zexu": "After watching this film, I learned that China does not produce opium, but imports it from foreign countries." One audience member wrote: "How happy I am that the British National Film Theatre can hold a Chinese Film Festival! 'Young People in Our Village' is the most delightful and unforgettable film I have ever seen. The characters in the film seem like the audience's own friends. I hope you can make more films for us."

    This film festival was especially welcomed by the broad masses of overseas Chinese in London. Many overseas Chinese watched almost all the films in the festival, and some even watched several screenings of the same film. They applauded warmly when Chairman Mao appeared in the films and at the end of each screening. One overseas Chinese wrote: "Through the films, we not only saw the past suffering of our motherland, but also the present joy of our motherland, which makes me feel even happier to live in the era of Mao Zedong."

    The British bourgeois press had to admit that Chinese film art leaves a deep impression. "The Times" praised "The New Story of an Old Soldier" and said that China's film industry "has developed at an astonishing speed" and that Chinese films "have made significant progress." Even "The Guardian" had to admit that "The New Story of an Old Soldier" "has commendable technical standards" and that the technical progress of Chinese films "leaves a deep impression."

    英国观众喜爱中国电影
    观众对中国电影的评价和反映是：“反映了人民的生活和人民向往的方向，可以看出中国人民充满了热情和精力”；“反映了人民的感情，相比之下美国电影不值一文”；“希望你们能为我们摄制更多的影片”
    本报讯　英国电影学会于8月23日至9月4日在伦敦的国家电影院举办了我国电影节，电影节期间，放映了“林则徐”、“老兵新传”、“宝莲灯”、“风暴”、“我们村里的年轻人”、“聂耳”、“五朵金花”、“女篮五号”、“水上春秋”、“战火中的青春”、“永不消逝的电波”和“欢天喜地”等十二部长片，以及“欢庆十年”、“含苞待放”、“拉萨河畔”等十四部短片。
    英国举办我国电影节还是第一次，这次电影节受到英国各方面的重视和观众的热烈欢迎。他们对中国的影片给予很高的评价。英国电影学会认为从上座和观众反应来看，电影节是成功的，放映效果出乎他们的意外。他们说从这次电影节可看出英国人民极想了解新中国，他们并表示希望一两年后再举办一次我国电影节。
    观众对我国影片都给予很高评价。英国普拉托电影公司经理佛曼称赞我国电影事业近年来有长足进步。英国文学家米内认为我国电影“反映了人民的生活和人民向往的方向，从影片中可以看出中国人民充满了热情和精力”。黑人歌唱家罗伯逊的夫人认为我国电影“反映了人民的感情，相比之下美国电影则不值一文”。看过“欢庆十年”的观众异口同声地赞扬，认为该片表现了我国人民的力量和十年来的成就。
    一位观众看了“拉萨河畔”后，在意见簿上写道：“我在报上看到中国政府在拉萨执行着灭绝西藏民族的政策，看了这部影片后发现不是那么回事，西藏人民现在生活很愉快。”有的观众看了“林则徐”后说：“看了这部影片后，我才知道原来中国不生产鸦片，而是从外国输入的。”一位观众来信说：“我多么高兴英国国家电影院能举行中国电影节啊！‘我们村里的年轻人’是我看过的影片中最令人喜爱与难忘的一部。影片中的角色好像是观众自己的朋友一样。希望你们能为我们摄制更多的影片”。
    这次电影节特别受到伦敦广大华侨欢迎。不少华侨几乎看了电影节所有的影片，也有连看几场的。当影片中出现毛主席镜头和每场映完时，他们都热烈鼓掌。一位华侨写道：“通过影片，不但使我们看到了祖国过去的苦难，也使我们看到了祖国现在的欢乐，从而使我更加感到生活在毛泽东时代的幸福。”
    英国资产阶级报刊也不得不承认我国电影艺术给人以深刻的印象。“泰晤士报”对“老兵新传”加以赞扬，并说我国电影事业“有惊人速度的发展”，我国影片“有显著进步”。连“卫报”也不得不承认“老兵新传”“技术水平值得称赞”，我国影片技术的进步给人以深刻的印象”。
