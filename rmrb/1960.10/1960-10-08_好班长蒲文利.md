    Good Squad Leader Pu Wenli
    By our reporter Li Heting
    In the famous "May Fourth" coal mining team of Hongshan Coal Mine in Zibo, Shandong, there is a good squad leader named Pu Wenli. He leads the second coal mining squad, and since March of last year, they have achieved high production in large areas of thin coal seams for more than ten consecutive months. In the first half of this year, the entire squad completed the half-year production plan twenty-eight days ahead of schedule, averaging 6.83 tons of coal mined per person per day. They have also maintained safe production for six consecutive years.
    
        One Key Opens One Lock
    Pu Wenli has a profound understanding: to mobilize the enthusiasm of all members of the squad, it is necessary to understand and grasp the ideological situation of the masses in a timely manner, adopt the method of grasping both ends and leading the middle, and use one key to open one lock to solve the specific ideological problems of the masses.
    
    The squad he leads has many new workers. The vast majority of workers have good ideas and are very motivated, but some individual workers sometimes have some ideological problems. For example, a new worker from a student background named Zhou Jiquan was not motivated enough for a while and was often absent. Criticisms from the staff did not work. Pu Wenli thought: Except for those with bad natures, people can all progress, and we must consider how to help him. Once, Pu Wenli asked him in the dormitory: "Why aren't you very motivated?" He didn't say anything. Pu Wenli then said to him:
    “If you have any difficulties, tell me and I will help you solve them.” After several heart-to-heart talks, it became clear that he was mainly afraid of getting dirty, tired, and facing danger in the mine. Pu Wenli often lived with him, telling him about the important role of the coal industry in socialist construction and the future of young people; explaining to him that accidents can be avoided as long as operations are strictly in accordance with regulations, and at the same time helping him improve his technical level on the spot, and instructing him on how to pay attention to sounding the roof and rib, and ensuring safety. After more than twenty days, Zhou Jiquan's awareness improved, his thinking slowly changed, his attendance rate often reached 100%, and his production also reached advanced levels.

      Adhere to "Four Same's" Sharing Weal and Woe
    Although Pu Wenli, like other shift leaders (i.e. section chiefs), is a cadre detached from production, without any labor quotas, he has long insisted on eating, living, working, and discussing with the workers, and often takes the lead in going to the most dangerous places to work and solve problems.
    
    Once, the work surface suddenly encountered a fault, and the roof experienced malignant pressure. Some of the props were cracked and bent. The roof had dropped thirty centimeters. At this time, inexperienced new workers were afraid and panicked, and some experienced old workers were also in low spirits. Pu Wenli, however, remained calm and decisive, reporting to the team secretary on the one hand, and convening a Party group meeting on the spot in his capacity as the Party group leader. After everyone analyzed the situation, they decided to lead the masses, overcome difficulties, and complete the task. He first rushed to the place where the roof was broken to wedge the props; all Party members also took the lead in rescuing. The workers all worked together and quickly overcame the difficulties, both completing the coal production task and protecting state property from loss.
    
              "Three Diligences" "Four Grasps"
    Pu Wenli often says that to be a good squad leader, one must be meticulous in one's work. In this regard, he created the "three diligences" and "four grasps" working method, which made the work of the entire squad well-organized and achieved high production every month.
    
    The "three diligences" are: diligent brain, diligent hands, and diligent legs.
    
    Diligent brain mainly means always achieving "five analyses" and "four considerations." "Five analyses": 1. Constantly analyze the ideological situation of the team members, prescribe the right medicine to solve problems, and keep them in high spirits; 2. Constantly analyze the workers' technical level, etc., and properly arrange work; 3. Constantly analyze the weak links on site, take timely measures, and grasp them firmly and thoroughly; 4. Constantly analyze the key issues in production and concentrate efforts to solve them; 5. Constantly analyze the experiences and lessons in safe production and strengthen safety work. "Four considerations": before the shift, consider the task of the shift, the conditions created by the previous shift and the outstanding problems, the measures for this shift, the attendance situation, and rationally allocate labor and properly arrange the work tasks of each person; during the shift, consider the task completion situation, arrange the workload for each hour, and ensure that each shift over-fulfills the production; at the end of the shift, consider the preparations for the next shift and the experiences and lessons of the shift to ensure that the next shift can also over-fulfill the task; after going up the well, consider the task completion situation, the safety situation, and prepare to hold a good post-shift meeting to conduct evaluations; commend the advanced and promote the backward.
    
    As for diligent hands, it mainly means dealing with difficulties (such as water leaks, broken roof, etc.) with one's own hands, and handling key issues personally; if new workers don't know how to do it, show them personally.
    
    Diligent legs mainly means checking the machine operation, engineering quality, roof pressure, and whether there is any idling in a timely manner, and dealing with problems in a timely manner.
    
    What are the "four grasps"? Pu Wenli introduced them in detail. To sum up, the first is to grasp the key to production, especially the safe operation of various machines; the second is to grasp the promotion of advanced experience; the third is to grasp the full use of working hours, seize every minute and second; and the fourth is to grasp the cooperation between shifts, take the initiative to create favorable conditions for the next shift, leave the difficulties to oneself, and give the convenience to others.
    
    In this way, Pu Wenli led the entire squad of workers, like an ever-victorious army, fighting underground and winning one victory after another.

    好班长蒲文利
    本报记者　李荷亭
    在山东淄博洪山煤矿著名的五四采煤队里，有一位好班长名叫蒲文利。他领导着采煤第二班，从去年3月以来连续十几个月实现了薄煤层大面积高产。今年上半年，全班提前二十八天完成了半年的生产计划，平均每人每天采煤六点八三吨。他们还连续六年安全生产。
        一把钥匙开一把锁
    蒲文利有这样一个深刻的体会：要想调动全班人员的积极性，必须及时了解和掌握群众的思想情况，采用抓两头带中间，一把钥匙开一把锁的办法，解决群众的具体思想问题。
    他领导的这个班新工人多。绝大多数工人思想都很好，干劲都很大，但也有个别工人有时有些思想问题。例如，有一个学生出身的新工人名叫周继泉，有一阵工作劲头不足，常常欠勤。职工们批评他也没有起作用。蒲文利想：除了本质不好的人以外，人都是可以进步的，要考虑如何帮助他。有一次，蒲文利在宿舍里问他：“你为什么干劲不大？”他不吱声。蒲文利又对他说：
  “你有什么困难，说出来，我帮你解决。”经过好几次谈心，才了解清楚他主要是下井怕脏，怕累，怕危险。蒲文利就经常和他生活在一起，对他讲煤炭工业在社会主义建设中的重要作用和青年人的前途；对他说明只要严格按章作业，事故是可以避免的，同时在现场上帮助他提高技术水平，指点他如何注意敲帮问顶，搞好安全。这样经过二十多天，周继泉的觉悟提高了，思想慢慢地转变过来了，出勤率经常达到百分之百，生产也达到了先进水平。
      坚持四同　同甘共苦
    蒲文利虽然和别的班长（即工段长）一样，是脱离生产的干部，没有什么劳动定额，但他很久以来，就坚持和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，而且经常带头到最危险的地方去干活，处理问题。
    有一次，工作面忽然遇到断层，顶板来了恶性压力。支柱有些被压裂和压得倾折了。顶板已经下降三十厘米。这时，没有经验的新工人害怕恐慌，有经验的老工人也有些情绪低落。蒲文利却沉着果断，一面向队支书报告，一面以党的小组长的身份，在现场召开了党的小组会议，大家分析情况以后，决定带动群众，克服困难，完成任务。他首先赶到顶板破碎的地方打嵌支柱；全体党员也都带头抢救。工人们一齐下手，迅速克服了困难，既完成了产煤任务，又保护了国家资财免受损失。
              “三　勤”“四　抓”
    蒲文利常说，要当好一个班长，在工作上必须抓紧抓细。在这方面，他创造了“三勤”“四抓”的工作法，使全班的工作井井有条，实现了月月高产。
    “三勤”是：脑勤，手勤，腿勤。
    脑勤主要是经常做到“五分析”、“四考虑”。“五分析”：一、经常分析组员的思想情况，对症下药解决问题，使他们经常情绪饱满；二、经常分析工人的技术水平等，妥善安排工作；三、经常分析现场薄弱环节，及时采取措施，抓紧抓狠抓到底；四、经常分析生产上的关键问题，集中力量解决；五、经常分析安全生产中的经验教训，加强安全工作。“四考虑”是：班前考虑本班的任务，上一班创造的条件和遗留的问题，本班的措施，出勤情况，以及合理调配劳力，妥善安排每一个人的工作任务；班中考虑任务完成情况，安排好每一小时的工作量，保证班班超产；班末考虑下一班的准备工作和当班的经验教训，保证下一班也能超额完成任务；上井后考虑任务完成情况，安全情况，准备开好班后会，进行评比；表扬先进，推动后进。
    至于手勤，主要是遇到困难（如淋水、顶板破碎等）亲手干，关键问题亲手处理；新工人不会干，就亲手做给他看。
    腿勤，主要是及时检查机器运转情况、工程质量、顶板压力、有无窝工现象等，遇有问题及时处理。
    “四抓”是什么？蒲文利介绍得很详细，归纳起来，一是抓生产关键，特别是各种机械的安全运转；二是抓推广先进经验；三是抓充分利用工时，争分夺秒；四是抓班与班协作，主动为下一班创造有利条件，把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人。
    就这样，蒲文利领导着全班工人，像一支常胜军一样，转战井下，赢得了一个又一个的胜利。
