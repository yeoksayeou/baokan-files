What is Parsons Doing in Laos?
Commentator of this newspaper

Just as the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Patriotic Front delegation began negotiations in Vientiane, Parsons, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs and former U.S. Ambassador to Laos, led a group of senior U.S. officials to Vientiane on the 12th for a three-day visit in Laos. Although U.S. officials, including Parsons himself, have tried to conceal the intention of his trip to Vientiane, it is not difficult for people to see from the sinister activities Parsons engaged in in Laos what the ill-intentioned visitor was up to.

During his short three-day stay in Laos, Parsons held two meetings with Lao Royal Government Prime Minister Phouma, and also went to Luang Prabang to meet with the King of Laos. According to a report by United Press International from Vientiane on the 14th, during his activities in Laos, Parsons made arrogant "suggestions" to the Phouma government to interfere in Laos' internal affairs, as conditions for restoring U.S. military "aid" to the Lao government. These were: First, stop the current negotiations between the Lao government and the Lao Patriotic Front; second, formally recognize the Nosavan traitorous group and its "government" established in southern Laos; and third, move the capital of Laos from Vientiane to Luang Prabang.

These three "suggestions" have revealed the true purpose of Parsons' trip to Vientiane most clearly. First of all, everyone knows that the current negotiations between the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Patriotic Front are the result of the heroic struggle of the Lao people of all strata for freedom and democratic rights, and also the result of the successful coup launched by officers and soldiers of the 2nd Parachute Battalion of Laos and the people of Vientiane under the command of the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le. The Lao patriotic progressive forces and the entire Lao people have clearly put forward that the purpose and task of this negotiation is: to solemnly and fully implement the Geneva Agreement, the Vientiane Agreement, and the supplementary provisions made by both parties through consultation, to adapt to the current situation in Laos, to restore the damaged national harmony, and to realize the peace and unity of Laos. The patriotic and progressive forces and the entire Lao people are eager for the success of the negotiations between the Phouma government and the Lao Patriotic Front. However, Parsons actually coerced the Phouma government to "stop" the current negotiations, which is obviously a blatant interference in Laos' internal affairs, deliberately undermining the Geneva Agreement, undermining Laos' policy of peace, neutrality and national harmony, and trying to throw Laos back into civil war and place it under the control of U.S. imperialism.

Secondly, the patriotic and progressive forces of Laos and the entire Lao people have long recognized that the Nosavan group is a loyal lackey of U.S. imperialism, and have been vigilant since the beginning of the coup against the danger of the United States using the Nosavan group to create rebellions and plot the restoration of reactionary traitorous forces. The development of the situation since the coup has precisely proved this point. On the one hand, U.S. imperialism instructed its two pawns, Thailand and the South Vietnamese authorities, to fully support the Phoumi Nosavan group's armed rebellion activities in various ways; on the other hand, it constantly put pressure on the Lao King and the Phouma government, forcing them to make concessions to the Nosavan rebel group. Now, since Parsons openly demanded that the Phouma government "formally recognize" the Nosavan rebel group and its "government" established in southern Laos, the hideous face of U.S. imperialism frantically interfering in Laos' internal affairs and being hostile to the Lao people has been even more exposed.

As for the United States' request for the Phouma government to move the capital of Laos to Luang Prabang, it is undoubtedly to attack the power of the Vientiane people, who have revolutionary traditions and a high degree of patriotism, in order to facilitate the restoration of the Lao reactionary traitorous forces.

It can be seen that Parsons' trip to Laos and the three "suggestions" he put forward to the Phouma government are a serious step taken by the United States to directly step up its interference in Laos' internal affairs. Since the coup in Laos in August this year, the Lao people's patriotic and just struggle to strive for peace and neutrality, national harmony, and to get rid of U.S. control has achieved continuous victories. The Nosavan rebel group supported by the United States has suffered repeated failures politically and militarily, to the point that the U.S. government had to send Parsons to put pressure on the Lao King and government.

However, Parsons' trip to Laos did not achieve the results he expected. According to Western news agencies, Lao Royal Government Prime Minister Phouma told reporters on the 14th that his talks with Parsons had not achieved positive results. He reiterated that he would not change his neutral policy. Prime Minister Phouma also said, "If it (the United States) does not help us, we will have to seek assistance elsewhere." He also stated that the only way to resolve the current crisis is for the Savannakhet counter-revolutionary committee to disband itself, and "there is no question of restoring their position in the government."

These statements by Prime Minister Phouma are in line with the wishes and interests of the Lao people. The facts since the Indochina armistice in 1954 have repeatedly proved that the fundamental reason for the constant turbulence in the Lao situation is that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have tried every possible means to undermine the Geneva Agreement and undermine Laos' policy of peace, neutrality and national harmony. Any appeasement or connivance with U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will only breed disaster, lead to the deterioration of the Lao situation, and threaten the peace and security of the Indochina region.

U.S. imperialism is obviously not willing to fail. When Parsons left Vientiane, he blatantly revealed the United States' ambition to insist on interfering in Laos, saying that "the United States will not give up Laos overnight." This cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of the Lao people.

China, as a participating country in the Geneva Conference and as a close neighbor of Laos, has deep sympathy for the Lao people's movement to strive for and safeguard national independence; it expresses its warm support for the policy of peace, neutrality and national harmony announced by the Lao Royal Government. The Chinese people strongly condemn this sinister action by the United States to step up its interference in Laos' internal affairs, and demand that the participating countries of the Geneva Conference and all peace-loving countries and people jointly stop the black hand of U.S. imperialism from interfering in Laos. The Chinese government and people have always believed that the Lao issue should be resolved by the Lao people on the basis of the Geneva Agreement and the Vientiane Agreement, and no foreign country should interfere. We sincerely hope that the ongoing negotiations between the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Patriotic Front can achieve success. The Chinese government and people have always firmly stood by the Lao people, who demand peace and neutrality, good-neighborliness and friendship, and work together to safeguard peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. As a Chinese proverb says: "Strong grass is known in a strong wind, and friends are known in adversity." No matter in the past, present or future, the Chinese people will always be the reliable friends of the Lao people and fully support their just struggle to achieve national harmony and peaceful neutrality.

    帕森斯到老挝去干什么？
    本报评论员
    正当老挝王国政府同爱国战线党双方代表团在万象开始谈判的时候，美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿、前美国驻老挝大使帕森斯，率领美国高级官员在12日匆匆赶到万象，在老挝进行了三天的活动。尽管美国官方包括帕森斯本人在内，曾对他这次万象之行的意图百般掩饰，然而，人们从帕森斯在老挝所从事的阴谋活动本身不难看出，夜猫子进宅，居心何在。
    帕森斯在老挝逗留的短短三天的时间里，同老挝王国政府富马首相进行了两次会谈，并且特别去琅勃拉邦，会见了老挝国王。据美国的合众国际社记者14日自万象发出的消息透露，帕森斯在老挝活动期间，曾经向富马政府提出了干涉老挝内政的狂妄“建议”，作为恢复美国对老挝政府军事“援助”的条件。这就是：一、停止老挝政府目前同老挝爱国战线党举行的谈判；二、正式承认诺萨万叛国集团和它在老挝南部建立的“政府”；三、把老挝首都从万象迁往琅勃拉邦。
    这三点“建议”，已把帕森斯万象之行的真正目的最清楚不过地供认出来了。首先，谁都知道，老挝王国政府和老挝爱国战线党目前举行的谈判，是老挝各阶层人民为了自由民主权利而进行英勇斗争的结果，也是老挝伞兵第二营的官兵与万象人民一起，在以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会的指挥下发动政变胜利的结果。老挝爱国进步力量和老挝全体人民明确提出这次谈判的目的和任务是：严正地充分地履行日内瓦协议、万象协议以及双方通过协商作出的补充条款，以适应目前老挝局势，恢复被破坏的民族和睦，使老挝的和平和统一得以实现。老挝的爱国进步力量和老挝全体人民，都在渴望富马政府和老挝爱国战线党举行的这次谈判能够成功。可是，帕森斯竟威逼富马政府“停止”目前的谈判，显然是明目张胆地干涉老挝内政，蓄意破坏日内瓦协议、破坏老挝的和平中立和民族和睦政策，要把老挝重新抛入内战，置于美帝国主义的控制之下。
    其次，老挝爱国进步力量和老挝全体人民早已认识到诺萨万集团是美帝国主义的忠实走狗，并且从政变一开始就警惕到美国利用诺萨万集团制造叛乱、策划反动卖国势力复辟的危险性。政变以来的事态发展也恰恰证明这一点。美帝国主义一方面指使它的两个走卒泰国和越南南方当局，以各种方式全力支持富米·诺萨万集团进行武装叛乱活动；一方面不断向老挝国王和富马政府施加压力，迫使它们向诺萨万叛乱集团作出让步。现在，由于帕森斯公开要求富马政府“正式承认”诺萨万叛乱集团和它在老挝南部建立的“政府”，美帝国主义猖狂干涉老挝内政、与老挝人民为敌的狰狞面目已更加暴露无遗。
    至于美国要富马政府把老挝首都迁往琅勃拉邦，无疑是为了打击具有革命传统和高度爱国精神的万象人民的力量，以便于老挝反动卖国势力的复辟。
    由此可见，帕森斯的老挝之行和他向富马政府提出的三点“建议”，是美国直接出面加紧干涉老挝内政的一个严重步骤。自从今年8月老挝发生政变以来，老挝人民争取和平中立和民族和睦，摆脱美国控制的爱国正义斗争，取得不断的胜利。美国支持的诺萨万叛乱集团在政治上、军事上连连遭受失败，以至美国政府不得不派帕森斯出马，向老挝国王和政府施加压力了。
    但是，帕森斯的老挝之行并没有达到他预期的效果。据西方通讯社报道，老挝王国政府首相富马14日对记者说，他同帕森斯进行的会谈没有取得积极的结果。他重申他不会改变中立政策。富马首相并且说，“如果它（美国）不帮助我们，我们就不得不到其他地方寻求援助”。他还表示，解决目前危机的唯一办法是沙湾拿吉的反革命委员会自行解散，“根本谈不到恢复他们在政府中的地位问题”。
    富马首相的这些表示，是符合于老挝人民的愿望和利益的。1954年印度支那停战以来的事实已经屡次证明，老挝局势经常动荡不安的根本原因，是由于美帝国主义及其走狗千方百计地破坏日内瓦协议、破坏老挝的和平中立和民族和睦政策。而对于美帝国主义及其走狗的任何迁就、姑息，都是养虎贻患，只能导致老挝局势的恶化，并且威胁到印度支那地区的和平与安全。
    美帝国主义显然绝不甘心失败。帕森斯在离开万象的时候，露骨地表明了美国坚持干涉老挝的野心，说什么“美国不会在一夜之间放弃老挝”。这不能不引起老挝人民的严重警惕。
    中国作为日内瓦会议的参加国、作为老挝的紧密邻邦，对老挝人民争取和维护民族独立的运动，抱有深切的同情；对老挝王国政府宣布奉行的和平中立和民族和睦政策表示热烈支持。中国人民强烈谴责美国这种加紧干涉老挝内政的罪恶行动，并且要求日内瓦会议的与会国家以及所有爱好和平的国家和人民，共同制止美帝国主义的干涉老挝的黑手。中国政府和人民一向认为，老挝问题应该由老挝人民在日内瓦协议和万象协议的基础上获得解决，任何外国不得干涉。我们衷心愿望老挝王国政府和老挝爱国战线党正在进行的谈判能够获得成就。对于要求和平中立、睦邻友好、为维护印度支那和东南亚和平而共同努力的老挝人民，中国政府和人民从来都是坚决站在他们一边的。中国的谚语说：“疾风知劲草，患难知朋友”。不论过去、现在和将来，中国人民永远是老挝人民的可靠的朋友，全力支持他们为实现民族和睦与和平中立的正义斗争。
