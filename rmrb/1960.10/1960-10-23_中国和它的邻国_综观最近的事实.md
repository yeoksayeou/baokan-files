China and Its Neighbors—A Comprehensive View of Recent Facts
By Joshi, Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Communist Party of India

Editor’s Note: On October 2, the Indian weekly newspaper *New Age* published an article entitled “China and Its Neighbors—A Comprehensive View of Recent Facts” by Joshi, Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Communist Party of India. This article uses a large number of facts to eloquently illustrate that China is implementing a foreign policy of friendly coexistence with neighboring countries and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world, and powerfully refutes the shameless slanders against China by U.S. imperialism and a small handful of reactionaries in India. We now publish an excerpted translation of this article:

In the Indian press controlled by monopoly capital, it has become fashionable today to systematically and consistently slander China. When the so-called "Chinese aggression" myth has become quite cliché and lacks any factual basis, the defamation campaign has turned to ideological aspects, and the most recent tactic is to nonsensically claim that the Chinese simply do not believe in the principle of peaceful coexistence.

Words spoken will spread; but without a factual basis, they cannot spread far. This is truly the fate not only of China-haters in our country, but also of all China-haters in the region adjacent to these two largest countries in Asia.

China's Proposal

Indeed, the key is to judge correctly and fairly who wants war and who is striving for peace.

At a reception hosted by the Swiss Ambassador to China on August 1 to celebrate Swiss National Day, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai proposed that countries in Asia and the Pacific region, including the United States, conclude a treaty of mutual non-aggression and peace, and build the entire region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. At that time, he directly expressed China's desire for peace.

This proposal did not come about by chance. In a congratulatory telegram sent on July 30 to the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Total Disarmament in Tokyo, he had put forward the same proposal.

Furthermore, for the Chinese, this proposal is nothing very new. As early as July 1955, Zhou Enlai stated that "the Chinese people hope that countries in Asia and the Pacific region, including the United States, will sign a collective peace pact to replace the antagonistic military blocs that currently exist in the region."

Since then, the People's Republic of China has repeatedly reiterated this proposal.

However, this practical and wise proposal to guarantee peace and prohibit war in the Asia-Pacific region was immediately rejected by the U.S. government. On August 1, the U.S. State Department issued an overbearing statement, brusquely dismissing the Chinese Premier's proposal as "just another meaningless propaganda gesture by the Chinese Communists."

Widespread Response

However, China's initiative received a fairly wide response from peace-loving people around the world, especially in Asian countries. Important intellectuals around the world and national leaders of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are clear-headed and wise, and they are not rendered senseless by anti-communist propaganda. At the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, they passed a general resolution declaring that "we demand the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Asia-Pacific region and in Central Europe, and demand the conclusion of treaties of mutual non-aggression between Asian and Pacific countries."

It can be seen very clearly from this that it is precisely the stubborn opposition of the United States that is hindering the formulation of practical and wise measures to guarantee peace in Asia, which people universally desire.

In an important foreign policy speech delivered by U.S. Secretary of State Herter on September 1 at the annual meeting of the American Bar Association, there was a statement by the U.S. government regarding its position. He was very blunt. He declared that in order to "prevent war," the "first important factor" in the "basic concept" of U.S. policy is to "maintain an impregnable strategic deterrent force."

Eisenhower's special message to Congress embodied Herter's aggressive and militaristic remarks at a higher level. In his special message, he proposed manufacturing more bombers, more aircraft carriers, more missiles, and more missile-launching submarines, holding more military exercises, strengthening continuous aerial alert activities, and spending more and more money on armaments.

According to Herter, the second "important factor" in the U.S. policy statement is to "maintain a credible, diversified capability to deal with and deter a wide variety of smaller threats to peace."

Life itself provides a very illustrative annotation to the above remarks through the illegal and criminal armed interventions carried out by the United States in Asia in Laos, Vietnam, and Korea, in Africa in the Congo, and in Latin America in Cuba.

China's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free Asia has been thwarted by the opposition of the United States; however, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are doing their best to defeat and smash U.S. interference in their respective countries. The Chinese government expresses its solidarity and practically supports the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggles for their own independence, thereby helping to change the past history of enslavement and writing new pages in the history of colonial liberation and world peace.

Instead of responding to China's proposal, the United States has been establishing missile bases in Japan, Okinawa, and Taiwan. Undeterred by this, the Chinese government has been negotiating bilateral treaties of friendship and non-aggression with its neighbors, strengthening mutual trust, and helping to save peace in Asia.

Apart from the common desire to defend their own national sovereignty and ensure a peaceful environment to develop their own economies and the lives of their people according to their respective circumstances, monarchical Afghanistan and the People's Republic of China have nothing in common in terms of the social and political systems practiced domestically.

Treaty Concluded with Afghanistan

In August, the Chinese government's friendly delegation, headed by Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, was warmly welcomed and concluded the Sino-Afghan Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression. China has already signed such treaties with Yemen, Burma, and Nepal. Such solemn treaties give China's peaceful relations with its neighbors a new legal form, against which any imperialist slander is powerless.

The Sino-Afghan joint communiqué pointed out: "Both sides believe that all disputes between Asian and African countries can be resolved fairly and reasonably in the spirit of friendly cooperation, mutual understanding, and mutual respect."

In an editorial on August 28, the *People's Daily* hailed the treaty as "a new victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit."

Indian newspapers have been painting the relationship between China and Indonesia as worse than it actually is, attempting to corrupt and influence the minds of the Indian public.

Agreement Reached with Indonesia

We can cite the authoritative words of such an important figure as President Sukarno himself. In a recorded speech broadcast by Indonesian radio on August 22 at the swearing-in ceremony of the new Indonesian Ambassador to China, Sukarno said:

"We have some difficulties with China, namely difficulties with the Overseas Chinese issue. But these are not major difficulties." He also said that these difficulties can be resolved as long as both sides have sincerity. He added, "However, these minor difficulties will in no way change our position and desire to maintain the closest possible relations with China... These minor difficulties are merely minor wounds on the skin and do not harm the body—the friendly relations between Indonesia and China."

The above hopes of the Indonesian President have been fully realized. At the meeting of the China-Indonesia Joint Committee on September 8, a complete agreement was reached on the method of implementing the Sino-Indonesian Treaty on Dual Nationality.

In a written speech, Abdulgani, Vice Chairman of the Indonesian Supreme Advisory Council, said that China, this "awakened giant," naturally makes some people in the world feel uncomfortable. However, the Indonesian people will not feel uncomfortable with the Chinese people's revolution. On the contrary, on the basis of "Asian-African solidarity and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the people of the two countries will help each other."

Disputes with Burma Have Been Resolved

Like our disputes with China, Burma also had border disputes with China. This dispute once aroused strong emotions and memories, and the imperialist reactionary forces and their agents attempted to exploit these emotions and memories.

Now, as far as the Sino-Burmese border issue is concerned, it has become a thing of the past, because the leaders of the two countries have successfully resolved this issue.

The conclusion of a treaty, the mutual expression of friendly feelings by the leaders of the two countries, and the giving of friendly gifts to each other's residents by one government on a border that once caused disputes but has now been resolved, mark the good-neighborly relations between China and Burma and the further consolidation of this relationship.

In an editorial on September 19, the *Rangoon Daily* wrote: "The smooth resolution of the demarcation of the Sino-Burmese border is the result of the spirit of understanding shown by the two countries... We believe that this is an example that every country should follow when resolving all disputes."

The U.S. government's irresponsible, yet not meaningless, rejection of China's proposal to rid Asia and the Pacific of the danger of atomic war cannot end there. The activities of the pro-Western Indian reactionaries to maintain and constantly try to exacerbate the tensions in Sino-Indian relations are also the same. China's foreign policy, however, is moving forward, doing everything possible to safeguard and consolidate the unity and peace of Asia on the basis of coexistence.

However, the propaganda organs of U.S. imperialism want to make peace-loving Indians view this new and constantly changing reality in our nearby region from a distorted perspective, so that we will listen to their newly concocted myths, that is, the so-called successful agreements reached by China with Afghanistan, Nepal, Burma, Indonesia, and other countries are entirely part of the Chinese people's sinister trick to isolate and force India!

These countries are common neighbors of our two countries—the two largest in Asia.

They have more in common with India ideologically and politically than with China.

Truth may take some time to triumph, but even a torrent of lies cannot stifle the truth, certainly not in this rapidly changing world of today.

No matter how the Indian reactionaries and the newspapers of the pro-Western monopolists resort to tricks, ordinary Indian citizens who pursue truth and love peace will ask themselves, and will ask everyone concerned: Since Afghanistan, Nepal, Burma, and Indonesia can resolve their problems and disputes with China, why shouldn't India, like all our other common neighbors with China and all adherents of the Five Principles, make repeated efforts until good-neighborly relations are restored?

Our neighbor China is making history. It is working to overcome the obstacles that prevent it from establishing good relations with all its neighbors.

Problems exist between India itself and China, but China's interactions with its other neighbors over the past year should convince all honest Indians that we too can resolve our outstanding disputes on the basis of the common Panchsheel principles.

### 中国和它的邻国——综观最近的事实

    中国和它的邻国——综观最近的事实
    印度共产党中央书记处书记  乔希
    编者按：10月2日印度《新世纪》周报发表了印度共产党中央书记处书记乔希所写的以《中国和它的邻国——综观最近的事实》为题的文章。这篇文章用大量事实雄辩地说明中国正在执行着同邻国友好相处、维护亚洲和世界和平的外交政策，有力地驳斥了美帝国主义和印度国内一小撮反动分子对中国的无耻诽谤。现将这篇文章摘译发表如下：
    在垄断资本控制的印度报刊上，有计划地、一贯地诬蔑中国已经成了今天的时髦事情。当所谓“中国侵略”的神话已经变得相当陈腐而又毫无事实根据可言的时候，诽谤的运动就转向思想意识方面，最近搞的一套就是胡说什么中国人根本不相信和平共处的原则。
    说了话是会传出去的；可是如果没有事实作根据，那是无法使它们传得很远的。这实在不仅正是我国仇华分子的命运，而且也是整个与亚洲这两个最大的国家邻近的地区内各种仇华分子的命运。
    中国的建议
    诚然，问题的关键所在，是要正确和公正地判断谁要战争，谁为和平而努力。
    中国总理周恩来在8月1日瑞士驻中国大使为庆祝瑞士国庆而举行的招待会上建议，亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国，包括美国在内，缔结一项互不侵犯的和平公约，并把整个地区建成一个无核武器地区。这时他就直截了当地表明了中国要求和平的热望。
    这一建议来得并不偶然。在7月30日致东京第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的贺电中，他曾经提出同样的建议。
    再者，就中国人来说，这项建议并不是什么非常新的东西。早在1955年7月，周恩来就已经表示，“中国人民希望亚洲和太平洋地区的国家，包括美国在内，签订一个集体和平公约，以代替目前存在于这个地区的对立性的军事集团”。
    从那时起，中华人民共和国曾经再三重申这一建议。
    然而，这项在亚洲和太平洋地区保障和平、禁止战争的切实而又明智的建议，却马上遭到了美国政府的拒绝。美国国务院在8月1日发表了一篇蛮横的声明，暴躁地把中国总理的建议说成“只是中国共产党人又一个毫无意义的宣传姿态”。
    广泛的响应
    可是，中国这一倡议得到全世界特别是亚洲国家和平爱好者的相当广泛的响应。全世界的重要知识分子和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家的民族领袖们是清醒和明智的，他们不受反共宣传之害而变得神智颠倒。他们在第六届禁止氢弹和原子弹世界大会上通过了一项总决议，宣布“我们要求在亚洲—太平洋地区和在中欧建立无原子武器地区，要求亚洲以及太平洋国家之间缔结互不侵犯条约。”
    由此可以十分清楚地看到，正是美国的顽固反对妨碍着人们普遍盼望的保障亚洲和平的切实而明智的措施的制订。
    在美国国务卿赫脱9月1日在美国律师协会年会上发表的一篇重要的外交政策演说中，有美国政府关于自己的立场的说明。他很直言不讳。他宣布，为了“预防战争”，美国政策的“基本概念”中“第一个重要因素”就是“保持一支攻不破的战略威慑力量”。
    艾森豪威尔向国会提出的特别咨文在更高的一级上把赫脱的好侵略的军国主义言论具体化了。他在特别咨文中建议制造更多的轰炸机、更多的航空母舰、更多的导弹和更多的发射导弹的潜水艇，举行更多的军事演习，加强继续不停的空中警戒的活动，把愈来愈多的钱用在军火上。
    根据赫脱的说法，美国政策声明中的第二个“重要因素”是要“保持一种可靠的、多样化的能力来对付并制止多种多样的比较小的对和平的威胁”。
    通过美国在亚洲对老挝、越南、朝鲜，在非洲对刚果和在拉丁美洲对古巴的事务所进行的非法的、罪恶的武装干涉，生活本身就对上述言论下了非常说明问题的注解。
    中国关于建立无原子武器的亚洲的建议由于美国的反对而不能见效；但是，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民正在尽自己的力量击败和粉碎美国对他们各国的干涉。中国政府表示声援并在实际上支持为争取自己的独立而斗争的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民，从而正在帮助改变过去的奴役的历史，写下殖民地解放和世界和平的新的史页。
    美国非但不响应中国的建议，反而却一直在日本、冲绳和台湾建立导弹基地。中国政府并未为其阻挡，它一直在同它的邻国商订友好和互不侵犯的双边条约，加强相互信任，帮助拯救亚洲和平。
    除了共同希望保卫自己的国家主权、确保和平环境来根据各自的情况发展自己的经济和人民生活以外，君主制的阿富汗和中华人民共和国国内实行的社会制度和政治制度毫无共同之处。
    同阿富汗缔结条约
    8月间，以副总理兼外交部长陈毅为首的中国政府友好代表团受到了热烈的欢迎，缔结了中阿友好和互不侵犯条约。中国同也门、缅甸和尼泊尔已经签订了这样的条约。这样庄严的条约使得中国同邻国的和平关系有了新的法律上的形式，对此任何帝国主义的诽谤都不能起任何作用。
    中阿联合公报指出：“双方相信，亚非各国之间的一切争端，是完全有可能本着友好合作和互相谅解、互相尊重的精神求得公平合理的解决的。”
    “人民日报”在8月28日的社论中，欢呼这项条约“是和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的一个新的胜利”。
    印度报纸一直把中国和印度尼西亚的关系描绘得比实际情况糟糕得多，希图败坏和影响印度公众的心灵。
    同印度尼西亚达成协议
    我们可以举出苏加诺总统本人这么重要的一位人物的一番权威性的谈话。苏加诺在印度尼西亚电台广播的8月22日在印度尼西亚新任驻中国大使宣誓就职仪式上发表的录音讲话中说：
    “我们同中国有一些困难，即在华侨问题上的困难。但是这些不是重大的困难。”他还说：只要双方具有诚意，这些困难是可以解决的。他又说：“但是，这些小困难丝毫不会改变我们要同中国维持最密切的关系的立场和愿望……这些小困难只是皮肤上的轻伤，并不损害躯体——印度尼西亚和中国之间的友好关系。”
    印度尼西亚总统的上述希望已经充分实现了。在9月8日中国印度尼西亚联合委员会的会议上，对执行中国印度尼西亚双重国籍问题条约的方法完全达成了协议。
    印度尼西亚最高评议院副主席阿卜杜加尼在书面讲话中说，中国这位“觉醒了的巨人”自然使得世界上的某些人士感到不舒服。但是，印度尼西亚人民对中国人民的革命不会感到不舒服。相反，在“亚非团结与和平共处五项原则的基础上，两国人民将互相帮助”。
    同缅甸的争端已经解决
    就像我们同中国的纠纷一样，缅甸同中国也曾经有过边界纠纷。这一纠纷曾经引起激烈的情绪和回忆，帝国主义反动势力及其代理人曾经企图利用这种情绪和回忆。
    现在，就中缅边界问题来说，这已经成为过去的历史，因为两国领导人已经成功地解决了这个问题。
    缔结条约、两国总理互表友好的感情和一国政府在一度引起纠纷而现已得到解决的边界上向对方的居民赠送友好的礼物，标志着中缅之间的睦邻关系和这种关系的进一步得到巩固。
    “仰光日报”在9月19日的社论中写道：“中缅边界的标界的顺利解决，是两国所表现的谅解精神的结果……我们认为这是每一个国家在解决一切争端时所应该效法的榜样”。
    美国政府不负责任地、然而却是不无意义地拒绝了中国提出的使亚洲和太平洋摆除原子战争危险的建议，事情不可能到此结束。亲西方的印度反动派维持和不停地尽力加剧印中关系中的紧张局势的活动也是如此。中国的外交政策却一往直前，尽一切力量在共处的基础上维护和巩固亚洲的团结与和平。
    然而，美帝国主义的宣传机关却想使爱好和平的印度人从颠倒的角度来看待我们附近地区的这种新的不断变化的现实，好让我们听信他们新编的神话，也就是所谓中国同阿富汗、尼泊尔、缅甸、印度尼西亚等国胜利地达成的协议完全只是中国人孤立和逼迫印度的阴险把戏的一部分！
    这些国家是我们两国——亚洲最大的两国——的共同的邻居。
    它们在观念形态上和政治上同印度的共同点比同中国的共同点更多。
    真理可能需要一些时间才能胜利，但是即使是连篇累牍的谎言也不可能扼杀真理，在当代这个迅速变化中的世界上肯定是不可能的。
    无论印度反动派和亲西方的垄断资本家的报纸怎样施展伎俩，追求真理、爱好和平的普通印度公民将会自己问自己，也会问一切有关的人：既然阿富汗、尼泊尔、缅甸和印度尼西亚能够解决它们同中国的问题和纠纷，那么印度为什么不应该像我们同中国的一切其他共同邻国和五项原则的所有信奉者那样，一而再、再而三地进行努力，直到恢复睦邻关系为止？
    我们的邻国中国正在创造历史。它正在努力克服妨碍它同一切邻国建立良好关系的障碍。
    印度自己同中国之间存在着问题，但是中国这一年来同它的其他邻国的交往经过应该使一切正直的印度人确信，我们也能在共同的潘查希拉的原则的基础上解决我们悬而未决的纠纷。
