    The Will of the People Cannot Be Insulted, the Determination of the Masses Cannot Be Humiliated

    Premier Zhou said in his condolence message for Inejiro Asanuma's assassination by fascist thugs: "This despicable act of the US-Japanese reactionaries will only make them lose popular support further, will only arouse greater anger among the Japanese people, and will prompt the Japanese people to unite on a broader scale to wage struggle." The facts are indeed so.
    According to reports, four million Japanese workers held massive nationwide strikes in eight hundred locations on October 15th, protesting the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma by the US-Japanese reactionaries, demanding the abolition of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," and demanding the immediate resignation of the Ikeda cabinet. In Tokyo, another 100,000 people held three large-scale protest rallies and demonstrations. In addition to workers, farmers, students, intellectuals, and ordinary citizens participated in the protest rallies and demonstrations. Countless angry fists and slogans that resounded through the sky were aimed at the Ikeda cabinet, which was at odds with the people, and its master, US imperialism.
    The US-Japanese reactionaries trembled and felt that their days were numbered. The ferocious faces of the reactionaries were also exposed more thoroughly, and the Ikeda cabinet had torn apart the disguise it had painstakingly crafted.
    Let's look at the facts: The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department even decided to apply the fascist "Public Security Ordinance" to prohibit gatherings and demonstrations that had not been reported in advance. If anyone violates the regulations, "the police will use force to stop them." The newly appointed Minister of Autonomy and Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission, Hideo Shuto, even smeared the demonstration in which Tokyo citizens spontaneously rose up on the 13th to protest the assassination of Asanuma by fascist thugs as an "illegal act" that had not been reported to the public security authorities. The Japanese cabinet also held a meeting to secretly plot countermeasures against the Japanese people's revolutionary struggle. Ikeda said after the meeting: For "violence," whether it is left or right, individual or group, it must be resolutely eliminated.
    The Japanese people's demonstrations and gatherings to uphold justice are described by the reactionaries as "illegal" and "unlawful," and the police will use force to stop them. But when the assassin Otoya Yamaguchi stabbed Asanuma, weren't the police present? They obediently watched from the sidelines. Who saw them "use force to stop" him? Who saw them "use force" to arrest the criminal?
    Inejiro Asanuma was only giving a speech on the stage, unarmed, and did not use "violence." However, he was violently murdered by fascist bandits. At that time, Ikeda was present and did not say a word. He did not "resolutely eliminate" the counter-revolutionary violence at all, but secretly plotted it and openly condoned it! Where did the violence come from? It came from the reactionary group of the Ikeda cabinet, from their master, the American reactionaries. And now they are still continuing to use violence, attempting to use violence to suppress the people's just struggle!
    However, the will of the people cannot be insulted, the determination of the masses cannot be humiliated, and guns and knives cannot frighten them! Over the years, the thousands of Japanese people have been educated by militarist elements and US imperialism, these negative teachers, and have been awakening day by day. Hideki Tojo gave them the first lesson, making them suffer the disasters brought by militarism; US imperialism and Nobusuke Kishi gave them the second lesson, and the Japanese people were reduced to slaves of a country that was unfree, independent, and undemocratic. The Japanese people have personally experienced that the only way to break free from the shackles of slavery is to unite and wage a resolute struggle. In the process of struggle, although there are many difficulties and twists and turns, the final victory will ultimately belong to the Japanese people.
    All the reactionary deeds of the reactionaries are only temporary factors, while the people's resolute struggle is a constantly acting factor. The Japanese people have great hope!

    民心不可侮，众志不可辱
    陈涛
    周总理在吊唁浅沼稻次郎被法西斯暴徒杀害的唁电中说：“美日反动派的这种卑鄙行径，只会使自己更加丧失人心，只会激起日本人民更大的愤怒，并且促使日本人民在更广泛的范围内团结起来，进行斗争。”事实果然如此。
    报载：日本四百万工人10月15日在八百个地方举行声势浩大的全国大罢工，抗议美日反动派杀害浅沼稻次郎，要求废除日美“安全条约”，要求池田内阁立即引咎总辞职。在东京又有十万人举行了三次规模浩大的抗议大会和示威游行。参加抗议大会和示威游行的，除工人外，还有农民、学生、知识分子和普通市民。一双双愤怒的拳头，一声声响彻云霄的口号，对准着与民为敌的池田内阁和它的主子美帝国主义者。
    美日反动派战栗了，感到日子不好过了。反动派的狰狞面目也更加暴露无遗了，池田内阁已用自己的双手把自己精心打扮的伪装扯得一粉二碎。
    且看事实：东京警视厅竟然决定要应用法西斯的“公安条例”，禁止事先没有呈报的集会和示威游行，如果违反规定者，“警察将用实力阻止”。新上任的自治相兼国家公安委员长周东英雄在记者招待会上，竟然污蔑东京市民13日自动起来抗议法西斯暴徒杀害浅沼的示威游行，是没有向治安当局呈报的“违法行为”。日本内阁也举行会议，对日本人民的革命斗争密谋对策。池田在会后说：对于“暴力”，不管是左或是右，个人或集团，都必须坚决加以排除。
    日本人民伸张正义的示威游行和集会，被反动派说成“非法”，是“违法行为”，警察将用实力去阻止。而当凶手山口二矢刺杀浅沼时，警察不是在场么？他们乖乖地在一旁看着，谁见他们“用实力去阻止”呢？谁又见他们“用实力”去逮捕凶犯呢？
    浅沼稻次郎只是在讲台上讲了几句话，赤手空拳，并没有使用“暴力”，然而他却被法西斯匪徒用暴力杀害了，当时，池田在场，一言不发，他对反革命的暴力，完全不是什么“坚决加以排除”，而是暗中主谋，公开放纵！暴力从何而来？来自池田内阁的反动集团，来自他们主子美国反动派。而现在他们还在继续使用暴力企图用暴力来压服人民的正义斗争！
    然而，民心不可侮，众志不可辱，枪刀吓不住！千千万万的日本人民，多年来在军国主义分子和美帝国主义这些反面教员的教育下，一天天地觉醒起来了。东条英机给他们上了第一课，使他们尝受了军国主义带来的灾难；美帝国主义和岸信介给他们上了第二课，日本人民沦为不自由、不独立、不民主的国家的奴隶。日本人民亲身体验到：挣脱奴隶锁链，只有团结起来进行坚决的斗争。斗争的过程中，尽管有许多困难和曲折，但是，最后胜利终属于日本人民的。
    反动派的一切倒行逆施，只是临时起作用的因素，而人民的坚决斗争则是经常起作用的因素，日本人民是很有希望的！
