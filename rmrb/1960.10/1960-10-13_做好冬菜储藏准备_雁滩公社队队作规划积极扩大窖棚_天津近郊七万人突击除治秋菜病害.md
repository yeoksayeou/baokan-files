    Making Good Preparations for Winter Vegetable Storage
    Yantan Commune Teams Make Plans to Actively Expand Cellars and Sheds
    70,000 People in Tianjin Suburbs Launch a Crash Campaign to Eliminate Autumn Vegetable Diseases
    (Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 12th dispatch) The Yantan People's Commune in the suburbs of Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, has summarized its experiences over the years, made unified plans, started early, prepared early, and arranged skillfully. While concentrating its efforts on doing a good job in the later-stage management of autumn vegetables, it is actively carrying out winter vegetable storage activities; and plans to expand the planting area of winter vegetables, striving to bring more, faster, and better-quality fresh vegetables to the market in winter.
    The Yantan People's Commune is one of the main vegetable production bases in the suburbs of Lanzhou City. This year, the commune's vegetable area reached 10,082 mu, an increase of 10% over last year. Due to the correct implementation of the policy of combining multiple planting with increased yields and high yields with increased yields, the total summer vegetable output increased by 28% compared with last year. At present, the more than 8,400 mu of autumn vegetables planted by the entire commune are growing better than in previous years. In order to ensure a greater harvest of autumn vegetables, on the basis of implementing the "three guarantees and one reward system," they launched a production increase competition centered on three waterings, four fertilizations, three weedings, and three thinnings.
    While vigorously grasping the later-stage management of autumn vegetables to strive to store more winter vegetables, the commune's Party committee promptly held a forum for veteran farmers, carefully summarized the experience of winter vegetable storage and winter vegetable production over the years, lined up the current agricultural tasks, and comprehensively and rationally arranged the labor force. According to the characteristics of this year's large winter vegetable storage volume, many varieties, and large climate changes, they comprehensively carried out winter vegetable storage preparation activities one month earlier than in previous years. The main contents of the vegetable storage preparation work are: 1. In the spirit of storing good vegetables in cellars and eating inferior vegetables first, the commune and teams made plans at all levels. 2. Expand cellars and sheds, improve ventilation and insulation equipment, and improve the quality of winter vegetable storage. In addition to conducting an inspection and repair of the original 200 cellars and sheds, they actively promoted the advanced experience of the Donggang Brigade, dug air vents, skylights, and air holes for all cellars and sheds, and left aisles in the cellars and sheds, and built 100 new cellars and sheds. 3. According to the market launch time of winter-stored vegetables, implement classified storage and graded management.
    At the same time, in the spirit of making the most of every inch of land and the more the better, they used a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to vigorously engage in winter vegetable production.
    In order to grasp the above work well, all members of the commune's Party committee and leading cadres of the brigades insisted on staying in the teams and implementing "four togethers." Now, all production teams have established specialized teams for winter vegetable storage and greenhouse and sun-facing plot production, and the materials needed for building cellars, sheds, greenhouses, and sun-facing plots, such as glass and straw curtains, have all been prepared. Winter vegetable seedlings in greenhouses and sun-facing plots have been cultivated. Early-sown tomatoes are generally flowering, and vegetable seedlings such as Chinese cabbage and cucumbers are growing vigorously.
    According to Tianjin Daily, the broad masses of commune members in the suburbs of Tianjin launched a general offensive against the three major diseases of autumn vegetables, namely downy mildew, soft rot, and viruses, determined to fight a quick battle and completely eliminate all kinds of diseases at this critical moment of winning a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables. At present, most of the more than 100,000 mu of Chinese cabbage and radishes in the suburbs have been sprayed with pesticides once, and severely diseased leaves and plants are being removed.
    After more than two months of hard work by the commune members, the city's autumn vegetables are generally growing well. However, due to the continuous rain and high humidity in the past few days, some autumn vegetables have suffered from the three major diseases, which seriously threaten the growth of autumn vegetables. At the decisive moment of winning a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables, the Party secretaries, commune directors, and team leaders of various districts, communes, and production teams went to the vegetable fields to conduct inspections and gradually clarified the condition; at the same time, a large number of cadres were transferred to the front line to take charge of areas and command the battle to eliminate diseases. After properly arranging the current "three autumn" tasks, the communes concentrated their superior forces to eliminate diseases. At present, there are about 70,000 troops in the suburbs of the city, fighting in the fields every day. In this battle, the communes in the suburbs adopted comprehensive disease control measures. Generally, diseased leaves and plants are removed first, followed by spraying, fertilization, and watering. This not only eliminates the source of infection, but also promotes the healthy growth of Chinese cabbage and enhances its disease resistance. (Attached picture)

    做好冬菜储藏准备
    雁滩公社队队作规划积极扩大窖棚
    天津近郊七万人突击除治秋菜病害
    本报兰州12日电　甘肃兰州市郊雁滩人民公社总结历年经验，统一规划，早动手，早准备，巧安排，在集中力量作好秋菜后期管理的同时，积极开展蔬菜冬藏活动；并计划扩大冬菜种植面积，力争冬季鲜菜上市多、上市快、质量好。
    雁滩人民公社是兰州市郊的主要蔬菜生产基地之一。今年全社蔬菜面积达到一万零八十二亩，比去年扩大10％。由于正确贯彻了多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针，夏季蔬菜总产量比去年增加28％。目前全公社种的八千四百多亩秋菜生长比以往几年都好。为了确保秋菜更大丰收，他们在实行“三包一奖制”的基础上，以三水、四肥、三锄草、三间苗为中心内容，开展了超产竞赛。
    在大抓秋菜后期管理争取储备更多冬菜同时，公社党委及时召开了一次老农座谈会，细致总结了历年冬菜贮藏和冬季蔬菜生产经验，将当前农活作了排队，全面合理安排了劳动力。根据今年冬菜贮藏量大、品种多、气候变化大等特点，他们比往年提前一个月全面开展了冬菜贮藏准备活动。贮菜准备工作的主要内容是：一、本着好菜入窖，次菜先吃的精神，社、队层层作出规划。二、扩大窖棚，改进通风、保温设备，提高冬菜贮藏质量。除对原有二百个窖棚进行一次检查、修补工作外，积极推广东岗大队的先进经验，给所有窖棚挖好风斗、天窗、气眼，窖棚内留好走道，并新修窖棚一百个。三、根据冬藏蔬菜的上市时间，实行分类贮藏，分级管理。
    与此同时，他们还本着见缝插针，多多益善的精神，用土洋结合的办法，大搞冬菜生产。
    为了抓好上述工作，所有公社党委委员和大队的领导干部都坚持驻队，实行“四同”。现在，各生产队都成立了冬菜贮藏和温室、阳畦生产等专业队，修建窖棚、温室、阳畦所需用的玻璃、草帘子等物资已经全部准备停当。温室、阳畦内的冬菜苗已经育好。播种早的番茄普遍开花，白菜、黄瓜等菜苗正在蓬勃生长。
    据天津日报消息　天津市近郊广大社员向秋菜的霜霉、软腐、病毒三大病害发起了总攻，决心在这个夺取秋菜丰收的紧要关头，速战速决，全歼各种病害。目前，近郊十余万亩大白菜、萝卜，大部分已经喷打了一次农药，严重的病叶、病棵正在摘除。
    经过社员们两个多月的辛勤劳动，全市秋菜一般生长良好。但是由于前些日子接连下雨，湿度大，以致部分秋菜发生了三大病害，严重地威胁着秋菜的生长。在夺取秋菜丰收的决战时刻，各区、公社、生产队由党委书记、社主任、队长挂帅，分别到菜田进行检查，逐步摸清了病情；同时，抽调了大批干部，深入最前线，分片包干，指挥除治病害战役。各公社在妥善安排了当前“三秋”工作之后，集中优势兵力，除治病害。目前全市近郊约有七万大军，每日奋战在田间。在这次战役中，近郊各公社采取了综合性的除病措施。一般是先将病叶、病棵拔除，随后喷药、施肥、浇水。这样不仅消灭了病源，也促使白菜健壮生长，增强了抗病能力。（附图片）
