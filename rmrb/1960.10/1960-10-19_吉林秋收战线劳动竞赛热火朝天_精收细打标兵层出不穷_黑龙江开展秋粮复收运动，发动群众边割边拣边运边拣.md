Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 16th. During the harvest season, the rural areas of Jilin Province are unusually active, and the first line of the autumn harvest is bustling. A new phenomenon has emerged in various places of “one-more” (more grain harvested), “three-fast” (fast cutting, fast transportation, and fast threshing), and “four-good” (good harvesting of grain crops, good harvesting of cash crops and minor grains, good harvesting of stalks, and good integration of various tasks). As of the 10th, the province's major autumn crops have been basically harvested, with the harvest period advanced or shortened by about ten days compared to previous years, and the quality of the autumn harvest is also good. According to inspections in Baicheng, Jilin, Tonghua and other regions, the amount of grain left in the fields has been reduced by two-thirds compared to previous years. Not only are grains carefully harvested, but also minor grain crops, industrial raw material crops, and vegetables are harvested cleanly. Currently, various localities have also organized a certain number of laborers to re-harvest and glean grain plot by plot in the harvested farmland, striving to bring back all the naturally scattered grain and return every grain to the granary and every blade of grass to the stack. At the same time, transporting harvested crops, threshing, and autumn plowing are also underway.

Since the beginning of the autumn harvest, Party secretaries and the vast number of cadres at all levels in Jilin Province have always gone deep into the fields to eat, live, work, and discuss with commune members, focusing on the central link of careful harvesting and meticulous threshing. A total of 240,000 cadres at all levels in the province have participated in the autumn harvest, exceeding the number of people participating in summer hoeing by more than 20%. More than two million cadres and staff of various organs, enterprises, urban residents, teachers and students of schools, and officers and soldiers of the garrison troops have also worked alongside the peasants, becoming a shock force in the autumn harvest.

People's communes in various localities have made full use of the experience of organizing collective production over the years, implementing line-based operations, stage-by-stage offensives, task allocation based on capability, strong-weak pairings, contract work with fixed quotas, and dual-fulfillment (full attendance, full quota) rewards to mobilize the enthusiasm of commune members and improve labor productivity. Various localities have especially emphasized "cleanliness" as the priority and quality first. Production teams in many people's communes have surveyed and identified various crops plot by plot, and arranged the harvesting sequence day by day according to the harvesting period of the crops, achieving nine-tenths ripeness, ten-tenths harvest, and harvesting each plot as it ripens. The Chalucha River Commune in Yongji County promotes a one-stop operation method of "cutting, bundling, loading, transporting, stacking, drying, threshing, winnowing, protecting, and managing," which closely links each process, ensuring that the harvest is clean and the threshing ground is clear. The Changling Town People's Commune in Changling County mobilized commune members to formulate operating procedures according to the different "temperaments" of crops, increasing the yield by 150 catties of grain and 200-300 catties of hay per hectare compared to previous years.

On the front line of the autumn harvest, competition among grassroots units is in full swing. Model figures who love the commune as their home and cherish grain as treasure are emerging in large numbers. For example, Jin Dongzhi, the leader of the Kaoshan Production Team of the Shulan Town Commune in Shulan County, who patiently helps commune members improve their harvesting skills; Song Zhenkui, a "flying knife" who "doesn't drop a grain in a thousand sickles, doesn't leave a spike in ten thousand sickles" from the Wulin Commune in Jiaohe County; Cui Shuzhen, a female commune member from the Guandi Commune in Dunhua County who picks up grain whenever she sees it; Hong Tingfang, a cart driver from the Dongfeng Town People's Commune in Dongfeng County, a model worker in transporting grain who doesn't drop a spike or grain while driving on rugged mountain roads; and Shi Xiangrong, a female commune member from the Daqingzui Commune in Dehui County, who motivates cadres' family members to participate in the autumn harvest and achieves full attendance, have all become well-known throughout the province and have become models for the broad masses of commune members to learn from, catch up with, and surpass.

People's Daily, Harbin, 18th. Various places in Heilongjiang Province are launching a re-harvesting campaign in conjunction with harvesting major autumn crops. At present, this campaign has achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics from the Songhua River area alone, more than 5.69 million catties of grain have recently been harvested from the already harvested farmland.

This year, the major autumn harvest in Heilongjiang Province is proceeding both quickly and well. In order to not lose a single grain or a single vegetable in the major autumn harvest, various localities have launched a re-harvesting campaign in conjunction with harvesting, transporting, and threshing. Counties and farms that have already harvested the major autumn crops have mobilized many commune members to carry out re-harvesting work. They have gleaned the harvested plots over and over again, and have also done so while transporting and threshing. In places where harvesting is underway, auxiliary labor forces have been organized into specialized re-harvesting teams, following the autumn harvest army to carry out grain picking activities plot by plot, closely integrating cutting, pulling, and picking. The people's communes in Bayan County have done a very careful job in the re-harvesting work. They have divided the personnel participating in the re-harvesting into groups according to the plots, with each person responsible for a row or a vehicle for re-harvesting. It has been done while cutting and picking, and while transporting and picking. In places where autumn plowing has begun, people holding the plow hang a basket on the plow, and pick up the crops when they see them, so that it is picked up as it is turned over. The 14 specialized grain picking teams of the Weimin Commune, consisting of 2,400 commune members, spent seven days picking out 150,000 catties of various grains from 39,500 mu of land. They even collected the bean pods on the bean stubble and all the scattered grains in the soybean fields.

    吉林秋收战线劳动竞赛热火朝天
    精收细打标兵层出不穷
    黑龙江开展秋粮复收运动，发动群众边割边拣边运边拣
    新华社长春16日电　在收获的季节里，吉林省农村空前活跃，秋收第一线上热气腾腾。各地大量出现一多（粮食收得多）、三快（割的快、运的快、脱粒快）、四好（粮食作物收得好、经济作物和小杂粮作物收得好、秸稞收得好，各项工作结合好）的新气象。截至10日，全省大秋作物已基本收完，收割期比往年提前或缩短十天左右，秋收质量也好。据白城、吉林、通化等地区检查，抛撒量比往年减少三分之二。不仅粮食收得细，小杂粮作物、工业原料作物和蔬菜也收得干净。目前，各地还组织了一定数量的劳力，在已割完的农田里逐块逐垅复收拣粮，力争把自然抛撒的点滴粮食全部拣回，颗粒归仓，寸草归垛。与此同时，运禾、脱粒和秋耕等工作也在紧张进行。
    从秋收以来，吉林省各级党委书记和广大干部始终深入田间，与社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，狠抓精收细打等中心环节。全省各级干部参加秋收的达二十四万人，超过参加夏锄人数的20％。全省各级机关、各类企业职工、城市居民、学校师生和驻军的官兵共二百多万人，也同农民并肩抢收，成为秋收中一支突击力量。
    各地人民公社充分运用连年组织集体生产的经验，实行分线作战，分段突击，量力分工，强弱搭配，包工定额，双满（满勤、满定额）奖励等办法，调动了社员的积极性，提高了劳动生产率。各地特别强调“净”字当头，质量第一。许多人民公社的生产队将各种作物逐块踏查鉴定，按作物收割期逐日安排收割顺序，做到了九成熟十成收、熟一块割一块。永吉县岔路河公社推行“割、捆、装、运、垛、晒、打、扬、护、管”一条龙作业方法，使各道工序环环扣紧，收打得地净场光。长岭县长岭镇人民公社发动社员根据作物的不同“脾气”制定操作规程，使每公顷耕地比往年多收一百五十斤粮食、二三百斤谷草。
    在秋收第一线，各基层单位竞赛热火朝天。爱社如家、爱粮如宝的模范人物层出不穷。如耐心帮助社员提高收割技术、舒兰县舒兰镇公社靠山生产队队长金东植，“千镰不掉粒，万镰不丢穗”的飞刀手、蛟河县乌林公社社员宋振奎，见粮就拣的敦化县官地公社女社员崔淑珍，在崎岖山路上赶车运禾不丢穗不掉粒的运禾标兵、东丰县东丰镇人民公社赶车手洪廷方，带动干部家属参加秋收并做到出勤满堂红的德惠县大青咀公社女社员时向荣，都已闻名全省，成为广大社员学、赶、超的榜样。
    本报哈尔滨18日电　黑龙江省各地正结合收割大秋作物，掀起了复收运动。目前，这一运动已获得很大成果，仅据松花江地区不完全统计，最近就在已经收割过的庄稼地里，又收获了五百六十九万多斤粮食。
    今年，黑龙江省大秋收进行得既快又好。为了在大秋收中不丢一颗粮食，不丢一棵菜，各地都结合收割、拉、打等工作，开展了复收运动。已经收割完大秋作物的县分和农场，都发动了许多社员开展复收工作。他们在割完的地块里，拣了一遍又一遍，并且作到随拉随拣，随打随拣。正在收割的地方，都组织辅助劳力组成复收专业队，随着秋收大军，逐地逐块，开展拣粮活动，作到割拉拣紧密结合，巴彦县各人民公社复收工作作的非常细致，他们把参加复收的人员按地块分成小组，每个人包一条垅或包一辆车进行复收。做到了边割边拣，边运边拣。开始秋耕的地方，扶犁的人在犁上挂一个筐，见到庄稼就拣起来，作到随翻随拣。为民公社十四个专业拣粮队，二千四百名社员，用七天时间，在三万九千五百亩地里拣出各种粮食十五万斤，他们连大豆地里豆槎上的豆荚和一切零散的粮食都收回来了。
