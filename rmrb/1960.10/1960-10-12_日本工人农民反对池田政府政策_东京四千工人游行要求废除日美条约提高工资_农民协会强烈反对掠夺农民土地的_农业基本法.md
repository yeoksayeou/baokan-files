Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 10th: Four thousand young workers in Tokyo braved the rain today to hold a massive "Central General Mobilization Rally for Maintaining Peace and Democracy and Crushing the Low-Wage System Imposed on Young Workers," and afterwards held a demonstration march in front of the Diet Building and the Prime Minister's official residence. The rally was jointly organized by the Youth and Women's Countermeasures Departments of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the Tokyo Regional Council of Trade Unions.

The rally unanimously passed a resolution firmly stating its determination to launch a struggle and, through the upcoming general election, to create conditions for establishing a government that would abolish the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," uphold the Japanese Constitution, and pursue a democratic and neutral policy.

The rally resolution also stated that the workers would launch a struggle to establish a uniform national minimum wage of 8,000 yen, uniformly increase civil servant wages by 3,000 yen, and abolish the temporary worker system.

The rally also passed a resolution demanding the postponement of the implementation of the deceptive "National Pension System."

The rally also passed a resolution supporting the struggle of the residents of Niijima against the establishment of missile bases and demanding the continued implementation of the agreement on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan.

Representatives from various sectors spoke at the meeting, calling on young workers to build on the great achievements of the struggle against the "Security Treaty" and inflict a heavy blow on the Ikeda Cabinet in the election campaign.

Yoshio Minami, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, called on the participants to use all their strength to ignite the high tide of the third unified action of the autumn struggle.

Shigeo Kamiyama, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, called on young workers to actively participate in the Communist Party and engage in activities in the election campaign to severely strike the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

Representatives from the Federation of Independent Unions, the Youth Department of the National Federation of Farmers' Associations, and the Japan Women's Association for the Defense of Human Rights also spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing their determination to unite and fight.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 9th: The National Federation of Farmers' Associations, a nationwide farmers' organization in Japan, issued a statement on the 8th, strongly opposing the Ikeda government's reactionary "Basic Agricultural Law" that massively plunders farmers' land.

The statement revealed that this "Basic Agricultural Law" revises the land system to allow "agricultural production companies" to own land without restrictions and to hand over land to "agricultural cooperative associations" for "trusteeship," its purpose is to force poor peasants to leave the land in order to reduce the number of farmers.

The core content of this so-called "Basic Agricultural Law," which has been strongly opposed by Japanese farmers, is to abolish the restrictions on the amount of land owned by each farmer stipulated in the early post-war period and to allow land to be handed over to so-called "agricultural cooperative associations" for "trusteeship." It was drafted based on the "Basic Agricultural Policy" announced after Ikeda came to power. Its purpose is to plunder the land of farmers, mainly poor peasants, support a small number of wealthy peasants, and develop larger-scale capitalist agricultural management, in order to reduce the agricultural population by 60% within ten years and provide a sufficient labor force for Japan's increasingly inflated industry. In addition, it also contains the purpose of consolidating the reactionary political pillar of the Japanese government in rural areas.

    日本工人农民反对池田政府政策
    东京四千工人游行要求废除日美条约提高工资
    农民协会强烈反对掠夺农民土地的“农业基本法”
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：东京四千名青年工人今天冒雨举行了声势浩大的“维护和平与民主，粉碎加在青年工人身上的低工资制度中央总奋起大会”，并在会后到国会大厦和首相官邸门前举行了示威游行。这次大会是由日本工会总评议会和东京地方工会评议会的青年、妇女对策部联合举行的。
    大会一致通过决议，坚决表示要展开斗争，并通过即将到来的大选，为争取建立废除新日美“安全条约”、维护日本宪法、奉行民主和中立政策的政府创造条件。
    大会决议还表示，工人们将展开斗争，争取建立全国一律八千日元的最低工资制度，一律提高公务员工资三千日元，并取消临时工制度。
    大会并且通过决议，要求延期实施欺骗性的“国民养老金制度”。
    大会还通过了支援新岛居民反对设立导弹基地斗争的决议和要求继续执行遣送旅日朝侨协定的决议。
    各界代表相继在会上讲话，号召青年工人在反对“安全条约”斗争的巨大成就的基础上，在竞选斗争中给池田内阁以沉重打击。
    日本工会总评议会总务部长南义雄呼吁与会者以全部力量来掀起秋季斗争第三次统一行动的高潮。
    日共中央委员神山茂夫号召青年工人积极参加共产党，并在竞选斗争中展开活动，沉重打击美日反动派。
    中立工会联合会、全日本农民协会总联合会青年部和日本妇女维护国民人权协议会的代表也在会上讲了话，一致表示要团结起来，进行斗争。
    据新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本全国性农民组织全日本农民协会联合会8日发表声明，强烈反对池田政府大规模掠夺农民土地的反动的“农业基本法”。
    声明揭露说，这项“农业基本法”把土地制度修改为允许“农业生产公司”可以无限制拥有土地，并把土地交给“农业协同组合”来“托管”，它的目的在于促使贫农离开土地以便减少农民人数。
    遭到日本农民强烈反对的这项所谓“农业基本法”的中心内容是要废除战后初期规定的对每户农民拥有土地数量的限制，并允许把土地交给所谓“农业协同组合”来“托管”。它是根据池田上台以后宣布的“农业基本政策”而拟订的。其目的是掠夺以贫农为中心的农民的土地，扶植少数富农，发展更大规模的资本主义农业经营，以便在十年内减少农业人口60％，为日益膨胀的日本工业提供充足的劳动力。此外，它还包含着巩固日本政府在农村的反动政治支柱的目的。
