    Nixon Openly Advocates Germ Warfare
    Even Claiming Research into Biological and Chemical Warfare is "Essential"
    (Reported by our newspaper) While continually delivering campaign speeches advocating for the "Cold War," U.S. Vice President Nixon recently clamored openly that the United States should prepare to engage in inhumane chemical and biological warfare. According to a United Press International report on the 21st, Nixon, in a letter to Harvard in Massachusetts, blatantly exclaimed that, due to the development of science and technology, the United States' "research and development programs in biological and chemical warfare" are "essential." Although Nixon used phrases like "self-defense" and "national defense" in the letter to conceal the U.S.'s crimes of actively preparing for germ warfare, facts show that the U.S. military authorities have never relaxed their research and production of chemical and biological weapons since the war. The United States spends $40 million annually in this area and plans to increase funding to more than $120 million in the next two to three years.
    According to foreign newspapers, one of the main bases for U.S. research into chemical and biological warfare is on the shore of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. It covers more than 1,000 square miles and has a new launch pad for launching chemical rockets. There is also an important research center and manufacturing plant at Fort Detrick near Washington. More than 4,000 scientific personnel work here.

### 尼克松公开鼓吹细菌战  竟说生物战和化学战的研究“必不可少”

    尼克松公开鼓吹细菌战
    竟说生物战和化学战的研究“必不可少”
    本报讯　美国副总统尼克松最近在连续发表竞选演说鼓吹“冷战”的同时，竟公开叫嚣美国应该准备从事惨无人道的化学细菌战。据合众国际社21日报道，尼克松在给马萨诸塞州哈佛地方的信中，公然叫嚷说，由于科学技术的发展，美国“在生物战和化学战方面的研究和发展计划”“是必不可少的”。尽管尼克松在信中用了“自卫”“国防”等词句来掩饰美国积极准备细菌战的罪行，但是事实表明，美国军事当局从战后以来，一直没有放松过对化学细菌武器的研究和生产。美国每年用于这方面的开支达四千万美元，并且打算在今后两三年内把经费增加到一亿二千多万美元。
    据外国报纸报道，美国的研究化学细菌战的主要基地之一在犹他州的盐湖边上。它占地一千多平方哩，并建有一个发射化学火箭用的新发射台。在华盛顿附近的德特利克堡也有一个重要的研究中心和制造工厂。在这里工作的科学人员就有四千多人。
