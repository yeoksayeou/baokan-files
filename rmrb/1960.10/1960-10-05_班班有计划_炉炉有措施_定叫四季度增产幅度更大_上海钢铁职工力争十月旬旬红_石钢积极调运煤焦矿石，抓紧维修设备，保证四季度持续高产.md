Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch: Shanghai's iron and steel workers, having surpassed their September steel production plan, are pressing forward with even greater vigor, determined to work hard in October and throughout the fourth quarter, striving for even greater increases in steel production.

In recent days, steelworkers from various plants have earnestly discussed the October production plan, implementing all economic and technical indicators such as output, quality, and consumption down to each workshop, furnace, and team. Workers from each furnace and team, based on the workshop's production plan, have also scheduled the tasks for each furnace for each day and each shift, identifying the potential for increased production in their own furnaces and formulating concrete measures. The No. 1 Open Hearth Workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant held a meeting of model workers, systematically summarizing the experiences of fast smelting and furnace longevity targeting key production issues. A fast smelting competition was also vigorously launched in each furnace in the workshop, thus further shortening the smelting time. The workers are determined to work hard on this basis in October and push the workshop's steel output to a new peak.

In order to ensure a substantial increase in steel production in October, the Municipal Metallurgical Industry Bureau and relevant departments are accelerating the allocation, transportation, and supply of raw materials, materials, and fuels, and are strengthening cooperation and contact with relevant provinces and cities to ensure the joint completion of raw material transportation tasks. All departments in the city, such as machinery and electrical engineering, have promoted a style of large-scale collaboration, actively tapping the potential of raw materials and materials to support steelmaking. Some steel plants have also added some iron-smelting furnaces, hot blast stoves, and other equipment, and have carried out equipment maintenance work in advance, preparing for high production in October.

Leading cadres of various steel plants continue to go deep into the front line of production, grasping the newly emerging contradictions in production in a down-to-earth manner. Office staff also go to workshops and furnace fronts to work, solving various specific problems together with the masses in a timely manner. Their slogan is: hearts to the furnace front, bodies to the furnace front, convenience delivered to the furnace front, ensuring a red start and red every ten days in October production.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, who have completed steel, iron, and steel production plans ahead of schedule in September, are actively preparing for production in the fourth quarter, determined to work hard for ninety days and strive for a red end to the year. The result of the increased production and economy campaign and the red flag competition carried out by the company in September was that the production levels of steel, iron, and steel increased by 14.8%, 11.3%, and 50.4% respectively compared with August, and product quality continued to improve. In order to further deepen the increased production and economy campaign, the company has issued the October production plan in advance, mobilized workers to discuss it, and formulated measures for increasing production and economizing, so that the plan is implemented down to the team and individual. While focusing on current production, all company employees are making persistent efforts to prepare for production in the fourth quarter as early as possible. Doing a good job in raw material supply and transportation is the key to further increasing production. After the company leaders held a special meeting to study this, on the one hand, they sent people to mines and transfer stations to actively organize the supply and transportation of ore and coking coal, and on the other hand, they tapped the internal potential of the enterprise, trying every possible means to increase the production of sintered ore, and strive to put the new sintering machine into production as soon as possible. The entire company has also launched a comprehensive campaign to recover waste materials, clear warehouses, and save materials. Recently, a large amount of coal, scrap steel, and scrap copper have been recovered.

In order to ensure the normal operation of various equipment, the company has carried out a medium repair on No. 1 blast furnace, and No. 2 and No. 3 blast furnaces have also been repaired. The Machinery and Power Department, the Safety Technology Department, and other departments have specially established equipment maintenance leading groups to mobilize the masses to carry out comprehensive safety inspections and carry out mass equipment maintenance and repair work. Many operation and running workers not only maintain equipment but also repair machines, greatly improving production operation rates.

    班班有计划　炉炉有措施　定叫四季度增产幅度更大
    上海钢铁职工力争十月旬旬红
    石钢积极调运煤焦矿石，抓紧维修设备，保证四季度持续高产
    据新华社上海电　上海钢铁战线职工在超额完成9月份钢产量计划的基础上，鼓足更大干劲乘胜前进，决心大干10月、大干第四季度，争取钢产量更大幅度的增长。
    这几天，各钢铁厂职工认真地讨论了10月份生产计划，把产量、质量、消耗等各项经济技术指标落实到各个车间、炉子和小组。各个炉子、小组的工人，根据车间的生产计划，又排出了每个炉子每一天、每一班的任务。找出自己炉子上增产的潜力和制订具体措施。上钢一厂第一转炉车间召开了标兵座谈会，针对生产关键，系统地总结出快炼和炉子长寿的经验。车间各个炉子还热烈展开了快炼的竞赛，因而转炉吹炼时间进一步缩短。工人们决心在这个基础上大干10月份，把车间钢产量推上一个新高峰。
    为了保证10月份钢产量的大幅度增长，市冶金工业局和有关部门，正在加速煤铁等原料、材料和燃料的调配运输及供应工作，并且加强了同有关省市的协作和联系，保证共同完成原料材料的调运任务。全市机械、电机等各个部门，都发扬了大协作的风格，积极挖掘原料材料的潜力，支援炼钢。有些钢厂还增添了一部分化铁炉、热风炉等设备，并且提前进行了设备检修工作，为10月份高产作好准备。
    各钢铁厂的领导干部继续深入生产第一线，踏踏实实地抓住生产中新出现的矛盾，科室人员也纷纷到车间、炉前办公，同群众一起及时解决各项具体问题。他们提出的口号是：心到炉前，身到炉前，方便送给炉前，保证10月份生产开门红、旬旬红。
    据新华社讯　提前完成9月份钢、铁、钢材生产计划的石景山钢铁公司职工，积极作好第四季度生产准备，决心大干九十天，力争今年红到底。这个公司9月份开展增产节约运动和红旗竞赛的结果，钢、铁、钢材的生产水平，分别比8月增长了14.8％、11.3％和50.4％，产品质量继续提高。为了进一步深入开展增产节约运动，这个公司已经提前下达了10月份的生产计划，发动职工讨论，订出了增产节约措施，使计划落实到班组和个人。全公司职工在大抓当前生产的同时，再接再厉，及早为第四季度生产进行了准备。作好原料供应、运输工作是进一步提高生产的关键，公司领导上专门召开会议研究以后，一方面派人到矿山、转运站积极组织矿石焦煤的供应和车船运输工作，一方面大挖企业内部潜力，千方百计增产烧结矿石，并力争使新的烧结机尽快投入生产。全公司还掀起了全面回收废旧材料的运动，清理仓库，节约用材，最近已回收了大量煤、废钢铁和废铜。
    这个公司为保证各种设备的正常运转，已对一号高炉进行了中修，二、三号高炉也作了检修。机械动力处、安全技术处等部门，专门成立了设备维修领导小组，发动群众进行全面安全大检查，开展群众性的设备维护和修理工作。许多操作、运行工人，既维护设备，又检修机器，大大提高了生产作业率。
