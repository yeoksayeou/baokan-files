    Leading Cadres at All Levels in Taishun Go Deep into the Front Lines to Strengthen Investigation and Research, and Use Typical Examples to Guide Overall Work
    (Our Newspaper News) After going deep into the front lines of production, leading cadres at all levels in Taishun County, Zhejiang Province, used the working method of investigation and research, dissected every sparrow, used points to lead the whole area, and constantly improved the leadership level of cadres, which powerfully promoted production.
    At the beginning of spring plowing this year, Taishun County adopted the method of dividing areas for contracted responsibility and implementing fixed points. More than 1,400 cadres detached from production were led by the county, commune, and brigade-level secretaries, and all were implemented in production teams, taking the team as their home, participating in production, and leading production, prompting the preparatory production movement at that time to achieve the requirements of early season, fast progress, and high quality. In order to further improve the leadership level of cadres and better lead the continuous great leap forward in agricultural production, the Taishun County Party Committee organized cadres to study Chairman Mao's two articles, "Concern for the Livelihood of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods" and "Preface and Postscript to 'Rural Surveys'," in light of reality, so that cadres ideologically clarified that after going deep into the front lines, they should pay special attention to strengthening investigation and research, and using typical examples to guide the overall situation. Leading cadres of the County Party Committee took the lead in going deep into the production teams, working on the one hand, and conducting systematic or thematic investigation and research on the other. Under the leading influence of the leading cadres of the County Party Committee, leading cadres at all levels throughout the county regarded investigation and research as an extremely important working method.
    The investigation and research work of cadres at all levels in Taishun County is closely centered on the Party's various policies and guidelines, and is carried out according to the key issues in the work of each period. Their main methods can be summarized into three types: First, county and commune leaders go deep into key points, and through investigation and research, help production teams to lead production well and create work experience. For example, in mid-April, Yu Fengtu, First Secretary of the County Party Committee, and Liu Xinbao, Secretary of the Secretariat, went deep into the Donghua Production Team of Shiyang Commune and the Xiacun Production Team of Xiaocun Commune, respectively. They worked and consulted with commune members during the day, and after understanding the ideological, production, and living conditions of the commune members, they conducted specific analysis on the key issues of production by studying Chairman Mao's works, linking their thoughts and work practices. They quickly helped the Party branch of the production team to do a good job, further implemented the Party's policies and guidelines, greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses, and greatly changed the face of production. Early rice transplanting, tomato vine pressing, expanding planting and intercropping, and tea production all overfulfilled the tasks, becoming advanced production teams in the county. Afterwards, the County Party Committee widely promoted the experience of Donghua and other production teams in thoroughly implementing the Party's policies and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses throughout the county. Sixty-three teams in the county quickly caught up with the advanced and excellently completed the various tasks of spring production. Second, in order to solve the ideological problems of cadres and the masses or a specific task in a certain period, targeted key investigations were carried out. For example, in the early rice over-planning movement, a few cadres and the masses believed that there was no potential to tap the land planting area, which affected the development of production. In order to clear this ideological obstacle, Li Qingtang, Secretary of the County Party Committee Secretariat, and others went deep into the Da'an Commune, led the grassroots cadres and commune members to the mountains, and conducted field-by-field investigations. As a result, they found that some mountain-side fields and cold-water fields were not included in the plan. Based on these circumstances, the County Party Committee analyzed that as long as it relied on the masses and utilized all the mountain-side fields and semi-dry fields, the early rice area could definitely be greatly increased. Therefore, the County Party Secretary and the secretaries of various communes immediately went to their respective contracted areas, took the lead in action, set an example, and held on-site meetings to promote it. As a result, 36,400 mu of early rice were planted throughout the county, overfulfilling the plan. This kind of investigation has achieved good results in the technical innovation, fertilizer accumulation, and field management movements. Third, at the end of a production movement and the beginning of the next, in order to explore the laws of the movement and the specific problems that may be encountered, so that the leadership can have a clear understanding and strive for the initiative, the county and commune respectively selected three to five representative production teams and sent out working groups to take the first step, do, research, and summarize at the same time. When the summer harvest and planting were basically over, the County Party Committee, according to the principle of "combining high yield and multiple harvests with multiple planting and multiple harvests," while vigorously grasping the field management of late autumn crops, promptly summarized the specific experience of Zhangcheng Brigade and other five units due to their adherence to multiple planting and multiple harvests last year and vigorously carrying out forest-grain intercropping, thereby achieving an average of 2,000 jin of grain per person, and promoted it throughout the county. At the same time, various specific policies were implemented, and a mass expansion of planting and intercropping movement was launched, so that the county expanded the planting and intercropping of autumn miscellaneous grains by more than 53,000 mu in half a month.
    In order to combine key points and general points, and to promote the overall work in a timely manner with investigation and research, the County Party Committee specifically studied the method of combining points and areas. Cadres at all levels were contracted layer by layer, operating on separate lines. Leading cadres of the County Party Committee lived in teams and contracted communes, commune leaders lived in teams and contracted areas, and brigade and production team cadres also carried out clear division of labor, which not only deepened investigation and research, but also used typical examples to promote the overall work of a region. This correctly handled the relationship between "point" and "area."
    After cadres at all levels went deep into reality and vigorously carried out investigation and research, because they did it themselves, saw it with their own eyes, and used their brains to think, they improved the ability of cadres to analyze problems and their leadership level. Now, among the leading cadres at the commune and brigade levels in the county, the number of those who have initially learned to do investigation and research work and the working method of using points to lead the whole area has increased from 86 in the past to 141. The main cadres of 124 production teams have also learned the working method of investigation and research. They can generally use methods such as individual interviews, field talks, and small-scale forums to listen to the correct opinions of the masses and implement the Party's policies and guidelines and various work tasks. The vast number of cadres generally reflected that labor brings investigation, practice plus theory, the brain becomes more and more flexible, and work becomes more and more handy. At the same time, in-depth investigation and research work also enabled cadres to better approach the masses and become one with the masses, grasping both production and life. The Yayang Commune Party Committee regarded caring for the lives of the masses as an important task, and from the commune secretary to the production team secretary, they spent three to six days a month going deep into the canteen to work as cooks. With the in-depth investigation, understanding, and specific help of cadres at all levels, 629 rural canteens in the county have established a solid foundation, so that commune members can eat well, eat their fill, and eat hygienically, and the labor attendance rate and work efficiency have been greatly improved.

    泰顺各级干部深入第一线加强调查研究运用典型指导全面工作
    本报讯　浙江省泰顺县各级领导干部在深入生产第一线以后，运用调查研究的工作方法，事事解剖麻雀，以点带面，使干部领导水平不断提高，有力地促进了生产。
    今年春耕开始，泰顺县采取划片包干、定点落实的方法，全县一千四百多名脱离生产的干部由县、公社、大队三级书记亲自带领，全部落实到生产小队去，以队为家，参加生产，领导生产，促使当时的备耕生产运动达到了季节早、进度快、质量高的要求。中共泰顺县委为进一步提高干部的领导水平，更好地领导农业生产持续大跃进，组织干部联系实际学习了毛主席“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”和“‘农村调查’的序言和跋”两篇文章，使干部在思想上明确了深入第一线以后，还要特别注意加强调查研究工作，运用典型指导全面。县委领导干部以身作则带头深入到生产队去，一面劳动，一面进行系统的或者专题的调查研究工作。在县委领导干部带头影响下，全县各级领导干部都把调查研究工作，当作一个极重要的工作方法。
    泰顺县各级干部的调查研究工作，是紧紧围绕党的各项方针政策，根据各个时期工作中的关键问题来进行的。他们的主要方法概括起来有三种：第一，是县、社领导干部深入重点，通过调查研究，帮助生产队领导好生产，并创造工作经验。例如4月中旬，县委第一书记于奉图和书记处书记刘心宝，分别深入到仕阳公社的东华生产队和篠村公社的下村生产队，白天和社员一起同劳动同商量，了解了社员的思想、生产、生活情况后，针对生产关键问题，通过学习研究毛主席著作，联系思想和工作实际，进行具体的分析，很快地帮助生产队党支部搞好了工作，进一步贯彻执行了党的方针政策，大大地调动了群众的积极性，生产面貌大为改观。早稻插秧、番茄压藤、扩种套种、茶叶生产都超额完成了任务，成为全县的先进生产队。事后，县委在全县普遍地推广了东华等生产队深入贯彻党的政策，调动群众积极性的经验，全县有六十三个队很快地赶上了先进，出色地完成了春季生产的各项任务。第二，是为了解决某一时期的干部群众思想或某一项具体任务，有目的地进行重点调查。例如早稻超计划运动中，少数干部和群众认为土地种植面积已无潜力可挖，影响生产发展。为了扫清这种思想障碍，县委书记处书记李清堂等深入到大安公社，带领基层干部和社员上山，逐丘调查摸底，结果发现有些山边田和冷水田都没有列入计划。县委根据这些情况作了分析，认为只要依靠群众，把所有的山边田、半旱田全部利用起来，早稻面积肯定可以大大增加。于是县委书记和各公社书记立即分头落到各自包干的片，带头行动，做出样子，并召开现场会予以推广。结果全县便种下早稻三万六千四百多亩，超额完成了计划。这种调查在技术革新、积肥和田间管理等运动中，都收到了良好的效果。第三，是在上一个生产运动基本结束，下一个生产运动即将开始的时候，为了摸索运动的规律和可能碰到的具体问题，使领导上心中有数，争取主动，县和公社都分别选择有代表性的三至五个生产队，派出工作组，先走一步，边做、边研究、边总结。夏收夏种基本结束的时候，县委根据“高产多收和多种多收相结合”的方针，一面狠抓晚秋作物的田间管理，一面又及早总结了章成大队等五个单位由于去年坚持多种多收，大搞林粮间作，从而实现了每人平均两千斤粮的具体经验，在全县推广。同时贯彻了各项具体政策，开展了群众性的扩种套种运动，使全县在半个月内，就扩种套种秋杂粮五万三千多亩。
    为了使重点和一般相结合，使调查研究及时推动全面工作，县委又具体研究了点面结合的办法，各级干部层层包干、分线作战，县委领导干部住队包社，公社领导干部住队包片，大队、生产队干部也进行明确分工，既深入了调查研究，又运用典型推动一个地区的全面工作。这样就正确地处理了“点”和“面”的关系。
    各级干部深入实际大搞调查研究以后，由于亲手去干，亲眼去看，动脑去想，也就提高了干部分析问题的能力和领导水平。现在全县公社、大队两级领导干部中，初步学会做调查研究工作和以点带面工作方法的，已由过去的八十六人增加到一百四十一人。一百二十四个生产队的主要干部，也学会了调查研究的工作方法，他们普遍能够运用个别访问、田头谈心、开小型座谈会等方法，听取群众的正确意见，贯彻党的方针政策和各项工作任务。广大干部普遍反映：劳动带调查，实际加理论，脑子越用越灵，工作得心应手。同时，深入的调查研究工作，又使干部更好地去接近群众，和群众打成一片，既抓生产，又抓生活。雅阳公社党委把关心群众生活当作一条重要任务来抓，从公社书记到生产队书记，每月都以三至六天时间深入到食堂去当炊事员。全县已有六百二十九个农村食堂，在各级干部深入调查了解和具体帮助下，建立了雄厚的家底，使社员吃好、吃饱、吃得卫生，劳动出勤率和工效大大提高。
