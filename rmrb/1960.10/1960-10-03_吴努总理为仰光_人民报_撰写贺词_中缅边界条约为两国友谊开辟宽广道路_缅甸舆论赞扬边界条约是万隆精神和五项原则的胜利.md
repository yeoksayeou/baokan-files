Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, October 1st: Burmese Prime Minister U Nu wrote a congratulatory message for the Rangoon-based Chinese newspaper "People's Daily," warmly praising the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. The "People's Daily" published this congratulatory message on its front page today. The congratulatory message reads as follows: October 1, 1960, will be a memorable day forever recorded in history. Today, China and Burma will successfully sign the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, which will open a broader road for further consolidating Sino-Burmese friendship. At the same time, this event is also fortunately happening to coincide with the auspicious day of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The friendship, built on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between the two neighboring countries—the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma—has become even more evident. At the same time, due to the existence of this close and friendly relationship, both sides are sincerely making efforts for each other's interests. Due to the long-standing friendly coexistence between the Chinese and Burmese peoples, the Chinese residing in Burma are sincerely coexisting peacefully with the Burmese people, setting an example for the world.

After the border issue is resolved, the two friendly countries will never again have doubts and misunderstandings. It’s also firmly believed that the peaceful coexistence and friendly relations between China and Burma will be furthered developed and consolidated.

On this auspicious day, I wish the People's Republic of China prosperity and progress, and Sino-Burmese friendship consolidated.
