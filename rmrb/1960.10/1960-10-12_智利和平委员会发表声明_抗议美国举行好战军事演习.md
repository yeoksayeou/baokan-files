Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, October 10th. The Chilean National Peace Committee issued a statement yesterday strongly protesting the joint naval exercises conducted by the United States and some Latin American countries in the Pacific Ocean.

This exercise, to be held in the waters near Chile, is part of a large-scale naval exercise that the United States and some Latin American countries it instigated have been conducting since August. The US fleet participating in the exercise, led by Rear Admiral Lee, Commander of the US South Atlantic Fleet, arrived today at Valparaiso, Chile's main port.

In its statement, the Chilean Peace Committee expressed its opposition to this belligerent military exercise. The statement said that under the current circumstances, holding such belligerent exercises is unacceptable and infuriating. The statement also expressed opposition to the Chilean navy's participation in the exercise. It said that Chile's participation in the aggressive plans of the Inter-American Defense Board clearly contradicts Chile's national interests and the Chilean people's desire for peace. The time has come for Chile to pursue a national policy that conforms to the interests and aspirations of the people and to abandon war agreements and other agreements that undermine national sovereignty.

    智利和平委员会发表声明
    抗议美国举行好战军事演习
    新华社圣地亚哥10日电　智利全国和平委员会昨天发表声明，强烈抗议美国纠集一些拉丁美洲国家在太平洋举行的联合海军演习。
    将在智利附近海面举行的这次演习是美国和它策动的一些拉丁美洲国家从8月开始举行的大规模海军演习的一部分。参加这次演习的美国舰队在美国南大西洋舰队司令李德率领下，今天已经抵达智利的主要港口瓦尔帕拉伊索。
    智利和平委员会在它的声明中，表示反对这种好战的军事演习。声明说，在目前的情况下，举行这种好战的演习，是不能容许和使人愤慨的，声明还表示反对智利海军参加这次演习。它说，智利参与泛美防务委员会的侵略计划同智利的民族利益和智利人民爱好和平的愿望是明显地相抵触的。现在已经是智利推行符合人民利益和愿望的民族政策，摈弃战争协定和其他破坏民族主权的协定的时候了。
