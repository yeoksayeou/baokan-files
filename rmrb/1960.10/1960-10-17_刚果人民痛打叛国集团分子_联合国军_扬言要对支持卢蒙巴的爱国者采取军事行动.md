Xinhua News Agency, October 16th, Leopoldville Dispatch: The Congolese people's struggle against the traitorous clique is further expanding.

In the Congolese capital of Leopoldville, following a group of patriotic youths angrily beating up Albert Ndele, the vice-chairman of the "Commissioner's College" appointed by Mobutu, and others on the 14th, patriots supporting Lumumba arrested two "financial advisors" of the "Commissioner's College" and another member of the Mobutu traitorous clique on the 15th. On this day, patriots also briefly arrested Joseph Nusbawmer, a senior "commissioner" of the Mobutu "Commissioner's College," and his assistant. Reports say that on this morning, a group of patriotic youths also beat up a member of a youth organization that supported the "Commissioner's College." Later, they arrested a pro-Mobutu person in the European quarter.

According to reports, facing this increasingly fierce struggle against the Mobutu rebel group, the "UN Forces" in the Congo are plotting to take further armed intervention actions. According to a Reuters dispatch from Leopoldville on the 15th, after Ndele and others were beaten up, a "UN Forces" spokesperson immediately held a press conference, expressing "sympathy and deepest regret" for Ndele being beaten up. This spokesperson even hinted that the "UN Forces" authorities would issue orders to take military action against patriots supporting Lumumba.

The "UN Forces" also increased troops around the hotel where Ndele was beaten up the previous day. In addition, according to Agence France-Presse, the UN Secretary-General's personal representative to the Congo, the Indian Daya, also sent his military advisor, General Rikye, to Elisabethville to discuss with Katanga rebel leader Tshombe the issue of the "UN Forces" "taking a stronger attitude" in the area of the Baluba people in northern Katanga, who are currently engaged in armed struggle against the Tshombe traitorous group.

At the same time, the Mobutu traitorous clique in Leopoldville has also intensified its persecution of patriotic people. According to reports, on the same night that Ndele was beaten up, troops controlled by Mobutu attacked the African quarter of Leopoldville. According to the Indian Press Trust, all those suspected of supporting Lumumba were beaten up, and some were arrested. United Press International reported that Mobutu's "Commissioner's College" also began searching for so-called "undesirable elements," including some foreign diplomats stationed in the Congo, starting on the 15th. Reports say that the "Commissioner's College" has ordered the expulsion of Guinea's envoy to the Congo, Tounkara, and declared Ghana's President Nkrumah's special envoy, Welbeck, an "illegal person," even ordering the army to "shoot him on sight."

    刚果人民痛打叛国集团分子
    “联合国军”扬言要对支持卢蒙巴的爱国者采取军事行动
    据新华社16日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果人民反对叛国集团的斗争正在进一步扩大。
    在刚果首都利奥波德维尔，继14日一群爱国青年愤怒地痛打了由蒙博托任命的“专员委员会”副主席阿尔伯特·恩德勒等人之后，支持卢蒙巴的爱国者15日又在利奥波德维尔逮捕了“专员委员会”的两个“财政顾问”和蒙博托叛国集团的另一名成员。这一天，爱国者还一度逮捕了蒙博托“专员委员会”的高级“专员”约瑟夫·努斯包默和他的助手。消息说，在这天早上，一群爱国青年还痛打了支持“专员委员会”的一个青年组织的一名成员。稍后，他们又在欧洲人区逮捕了一名亲蒙博托的人。
    据报道，面对着这种日益激烈的反对蒙博托叛乱集团的斗争，在刚果的“联合国军”正在阴谋采取进一步的武装干涉行动。据路透社15日自利奥波德维尔报道，在恩德勒等人遭到痛打以后，“联合国军”发言人立即举行记者招待会，竟对恩德勒遭到痛打一事表示“同情和最深切的遗憾”。这个发言人甚至暗示“联合国军”当局要发出命令，对支持卢蒙巴的爱国者采取军事行动。
    “联合国军”还在前一天恩德勒遭到痛打的旅馆周围增加了军队。另外，据法新社报道，联合国秘书长驻刚果的私人代表印度人达雅尔还派出了他的军事顾问里克耶将军前去伊利沙伯维尔，同加丹加叛乱头子冲伯商谈“联合国军”在正在进行武装斗争反对冲伯叛国集团的加丹加北部巴卢巴族人地区“采取更有力的态度”的问题。
    与此同时，在利奥波德维尔的蒙博托叛国集团也加紧了对爱国人民的迫害。据报道，就在恩德勒遭到痛打的当天晚上，蒙博托控制的军队袭击了利奥波德维尔的非洲人区。据印度报业托辣斯报道，所有被怀疑为支持卢蒙巴的人都遭到了毒打，有些人遭到逮捕。合众国际社报道说，蒙博托的“专员委员会”还从15日起开始搜捕包括一些驻刚果的外国外交官在内的所谓“不良分子”。消息说，这个“专员委员会”已下令驱逐几内亚驻刚果的使节通卡拉，并宣布加纳总统恩克鲁玛的特使韦尔贝克为“非法的人”，竟然下令军队“看见他就开枪”。
