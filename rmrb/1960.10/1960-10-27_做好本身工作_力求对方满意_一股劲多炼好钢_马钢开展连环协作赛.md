This newspaper reports from Hefei on October 26th: Workers at the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company are enthusiastically launching a continuous collaboration competition centered on "producing more steel, producing good steel," helping and promoting each other, and production is continuously rising. Steel production in September increased by 26% compared to August, and in the first half of October, it increased by another 38.13% compared to the same period in September. The qualified rate of steel ingots increased by 2.71% compared to September, and the consumption of pig iron per ton of steel in the converter also greatly decreased.

The content of the continuous collaboration competition is: with the steel plant producing more steel and good steel as the center, organizing the raw material departments to supply good ore and good coke to the smelting department in a timely manner, the iron plant to ensure good iron for the steel plant to make good steel, and the machine repair, power, transportation, and other departments to closely cooperate. Each plant and mine has signed collaboration competition contracts with each other, taking the initiative to do each task more meticulously and outstandingly, striving to satisfy the other party. The vast number of workers also regard the quality of collaboration as an important part of the labor competition for evaluation.

The continuous collaboration competition has further mobilized the production enthusiasm of the vast number of workers, and a great situation has emerged on all fronts of the company. Workers in mines, coking plants, and raw material management are taking the initiative to understand the production situation of blast furnaces, listen to the opinions and requirements of the ironmaking department, and do everything possible to ensure that blast furnaces are "well-fed and well-nourished." Nanshan, Gushan, and Taochong iron mines have adopted the method of grasping mining on the one hand and processing and dispatching on the other hand. In early October, not only did ore production increase by 5.01% compared to the same period in September, but it was also transported more promptly, enabling the iron plant to maintain ore reserves for more than four days. Workers in Hao Xieshun's team, who are in charge of raw material management, insist on sieving ore and coke two or three times every day before sending it to the blast furnace in order to be good "cooks" for the blast furnace. Ironmaking workers assured the steel plant: they will ensure timely delivery of molten iron and low sulfur content in pig iron. The No. 1 workshop of the No. 1 Iron Plant has strengthened contact and cooperation with the steel plant, providing as much molten iron as the converter needs, whenever it needs it. In order to reduce the sulfur content of molten iron, furnace workers immediately take samples for analysis after the tap hole is opened, and if high sulfur content is detected, they immediately perform external desulfurization. The company's pig iron production in the first half of October increased by 5.76% compared to the same period in September, and the quality also improved significantly.

The workers of the ironmaking plant produced a large amount of good iron, which not only guaranteed the increasing quantity of externally transferred pig iron but also boosted the labor enthusiasm of the steel plant workers. Steel plants have generally launched collaboration competitions and counterpart competitions between furnaces and furnaces, shifts and shifts, groups and groups, and individuals and individuals, with the converter as the center and the melting furnace as the key, and new records are emerging one after another. Pu Guangting, Gao Pengnian, and Zhong Yuanhua, skilled steelmakers in the No. 2 Workshop of the No. 1 Steel Plant, raced against each other, and on the 11th, they successively created three new records of 106 tons, 116 tons, and 123 tons of shift production, exceeding the daily operation plan by 34%.

Workers in the machine repair and power departments have organized shock teams and general survey teams, bringing their own tools to the production sites such as blast furnaces and converters to solicit opinions, discover problems, and repair equipment in a timely manner. Many maintenance plans have been completed ahead of schedule, ensuring better normal operation of various equipment. For example, a large blower in the No. 2 Ironmaking Plant, which was originally scheduled to be repaired in six days, was completed in only two days. Transportation workers have launched a competition to "load quickly, transport accurately, and unload quickly," delivering raw materials and supplies to the units in need ahead of schedule.

### 做好本身工作  力求对方满意  一股劲多炼好钢  马钢开展连环协作赛

    做好本身工作  力求对方满意  一股劲多炼好钢
    马钢开展连环协作赛
    本报合肥26日电　马鞍山钢铁公司各单位职工热烈展开以“多出钢、出好钢”为中心的连环协作大竞赛，相互帮助，相互促进，生产不断上升。9月份钢产量比8月份增长26％，10月上半月比9月同期再增长38.13％，钢锭合格率比9月份提高2.71％，转炉每吨钢的生铁消耗也大大降低。
    连环协作大竞赛的内容是：以钢厂多出钢、出好钢为中心，组织原料部门以好矿、好焦及时供应冶炼部门，铁厂以好铁保证钢厂炼好钢，机修、动力、运输等部门紧密配合。各厂矿都相互签订了协作竞赛合同，主动把各项工作做得更细致、更出色，力争让对方满意。广大职工还把协作得好坏，作为劳动竞赛的一项重要内容进行评比。
    连环协作大竞赛进一步调动了广大职工的生产积极性，全公司条条战线都出现了一派大好形势。矿山、焦厂、原料管理工人，主动了解高炉生产情况，听取炼铁部门的意见和要求，千方百计保证高炉“吃饱、吃好”。南山、姑山和桃冲铁矿采取一手抓采矿、一手抓加工调运的办法，10月上旬不仅矿石产量比9月同期增长5.01％，运的也更及时，使铁厂能够经常保持四天以上的矿石储备。搞原料管理的郝协顺班的工人为了当好高炉“厨师”，天天坚持把矿石、焦炭过筛两三次，再送到高炉。炼铁职工向钢厂保证：要做到接替铁水及时，生铁含硫低。一铁厂一车间加强了同钢厂的联系、配合，做到转炉要多少铁水就给多少铁水，什么时候要就什么时候给。为了降低铁水含硫量，炉前工在出铁口打开以后，都立即取样分析，发现硫高就马上进行炉外脱硫。全公司10月上半月的生铁产量，比9月同期增长5.76％，质量也有显著提高。
    炼铁厂职工生产出大量好铁，既保证了外调生铁的数量日益增长，又鼓舞了钢厂职工的劳动热情。各钢厂普遍开展了以转炉为中心、以化铁炉为重点的炉与炉、班与班、组与组、个人与个人之间的协作赛、对口赛，新纪录层出不穷。炼钢一厂二车间炼钢能手蒲光庭、高鹏年、钟远华三个班你追我赶，在11日就接连创造了班产106吨、116吨、123吨三个新纪录，超额34％完成了日作业计划。
    机修和动力部门的职工组织了突击队、普查队，自带工具深入高炉、转炉等生产现场，征求意见，发掘问题，及时检修设备。许多检修计划都提前实现，保证了各种设备更好地正常运转。如第二炼铁厂的一台大风机，原订六天检修好，结果却只用了两天。运输职工开展了“装得快、运得准、卸得快”的竞赛，提前把原料、物资送到需要单位。
