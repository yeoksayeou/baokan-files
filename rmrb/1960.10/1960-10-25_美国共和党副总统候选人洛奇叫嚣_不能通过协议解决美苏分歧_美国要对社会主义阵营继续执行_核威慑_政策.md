Xinhua News Agency, Chicago, 23rd: U.S. Republican Vice Presidential candidate and former Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Lodge, yesterday declared that the United States cannot reach an agreement with the socialist camp, but must eliminate the socialist camp.

    According to an Associated Press report, Lodge, answering reporters' questions on a local television program, said that the United States cannot resolve its differences with the Soviet Union through agreements, but must promote American "ideals" and "way of life" throughout the world, and arouse the world's "enthusiasm" for them to "win in the struggle against communism." He said that the United States "cannot do this with agreements," but must make American "ideals" and "way of life" "more attractive than the communist way of life."

    In his speech, Lodge also emphasized that American imperialism should continue to implement a "nuclear deterrence" policy against the socialist camp. Lodge also reiterated the United States' policy of hostility towards China and obstruction of the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. He said that even if the United States is "defeated" on the issue of restoring China's representation, it will "stay there and fight for another day."

    美国共和党副总统候选人洛奇叫嚣
    不能通过协议解决美苏分歧

    据新华社23日讯　芝加哥消息：美国共和党副总统候选人、前驻联合国常任代表洛奇昨天声言，美国不能同社会主义阵营达成协议，而是必须要消灭社会主义阵营。
    据美联社报道，洛奇在当地电视节目里回答记者的提问时说，美国不能通过协定来解决它和苏联的分歧，而必须在全世界推广美国的“理想”和“生活方式”，激起世界对它们的“热情”来“在同共产主义的斗争中取得胜利”。他说，美国“不能以协议来做到这一点”，而是要使美国的“理想”和“生活方式”“比共产主义的生活方式更富有吸引力”。
    洛奇在演说中还强调美帝国主义对社会主义阵营要继续执行“核威慑”政策。洛奇还重申美国敌视中国、阻挠恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位的政策。他说，在恢复中国代表权的问题上，即使美国“被击败的话”，它也将“留在那里再作一天的斗争”。
