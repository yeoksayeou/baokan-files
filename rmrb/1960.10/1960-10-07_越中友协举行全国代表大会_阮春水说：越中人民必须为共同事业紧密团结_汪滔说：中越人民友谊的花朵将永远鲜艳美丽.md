Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 5th. The Vietnam-China Friendship Association held its Second National Congress here today.

The congress re-elected the Central Committee of the Association and adopted new articles of association and resolutions. The congress also unanimously adopted telegrams to President Ho Chi Minh and the China-Vietnam Friendship Association.

A total of 430 delegates participated in the congress. Ton Duc Thang, Presidium Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, Hoang Van Hoan, member of the Politburo of the Labor Party Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, Phan Ke Toai, Deputy Prime Minister of the Government, and Le Dinh Tham, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front, attended the congress.

Wang Tao, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam, and others were invited to attend the congress.

The Vietnam-China Friendship Association was established in 1950 and held its first National Congress in 1955.

Nguyen Xuan Thuy, Acting President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, delivered the opening speech. At his suggestion, all the delegates stood up and observed a moment of silence to pay tribute to the late President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, Thi Son, Bui Ky, and the Chinese experts and technicians who sacrificed their lives in Vietnam.

Nguyen Xuan Thuy pointed out that very significant changes have taken place in both Vietnam and China in the ten years since the establishment of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, especially in the last five years. He said that we are pleased that over the past ten years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, have achieved very significant victories. At present, the Chinese countryside has become the countryside of people's communes, and cities are also organizing people's communes. He said that the birth and rapid growth of the People's Republic of China has changed the face of Asia, inspired the national liberation movement and the fighting will of the oppressed people, thus completely tilting the balance of world power towards the camp of peace and socialism. Nguyen Xuan Thuy condemned U.S. imperialism for occupying China's territory of Taiwan and supported the right of the Chinese people to liberate China's territory of Taiwan. He said that the most dangerous common enemy of the people of China and Vietnam at present is precisely U.S. imperialism, which is invading South Vietnam and occupying Taiwan. The two countries are jointly fighting for socialism and communism, jointly supporting the national liberation movement, and jointly fighting for peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, the people of the two countries must unite closely. This friendship is unbreakable. He also said that U.S. imperialism is not only the most dangerous enemy of the people of Vietnam and China, but also the most dangerous enemy of world peace.

Charge d'Affaires ad interim Wang Tao spoke at the meeting at the invitation. On behalf of the Chinese people, he extended the most sincere and warmest congratulations to this congress, which was full of brotherly friendship. He then said that the Vietnam-China Friendship Association has made positive contributions to enhancing the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Vietnam, and the Chinese people will always be grateful for this contribution. He expressed his belief that the flowers of Sino-Vietnamese friendship will always be bright and beautiful.

Sun Guangfa, Secretary-General of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, delivered a report to the congress on the work of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association over the past five years. He said that over the past five years, under the correct leadership of the Vietnam Labor Party headed by the beloved President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam-China Friendship Association has coordinated with various departments and people's organizations to carry out propaganda activities introducing China to the Vietnamese people, and has achieved certain results. When talking about the future work direction of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, Sun Guangfa said that our direction is: to continue to educate the people with the spirit of combining proletarian internationalism with true patriotism; to expand contacts and cultural exchanges with various Chinese organizations and individuals; and to develop organizations in various economic and cultural grassroots units. The congress then listened to Le Huy Van's report on the revision of the articles of association and Chen Huy Lieu, Vice President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, on participating in China's celebration of the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Chen Huy Lieu read out at the congress the telegram sent by the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship People's Commune in Beijing to the Vietnam-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Hanoi. When the telegram was read out, all the delegates responded with warm applause.

The congress elected thirty-seven new members of the Central Committee of the Association. Nguyen Xuan Thuy was elected President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, Chen Huy Lieu, Nguyen Xuan Luyen, Nguyen Van Huyen, and Deng Tai Mei were elected Vice Presidents, Sun Guangfa was elected Secretary-General, and Chen Gong and Le Huy Van were elected Deputy Secretaries-General.

    新华社河内5日电　越中友好协会今天在这里召开了第二次全国代表大会。
    大会改选了协会的中央委员会，通过了新的会章和决议。大会还一致通过了给胡志明主席和中越友好协会的电报。
    参加这次大会的代表共有四百三十人。越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团主席孙德胜，劳动党中央政治局委员、国会常务委员会副主席黄文欢，政府副总理潘继遂，祖国战线中央委员会主席团委员黎廷探等出席了大会。

    越中友好协会代会长、国会常务委员会副主席阮春水首先致开幕词。根据他的提议，全体代表起立，为已故的越中友协前会长诗山、裴?和在越南牺牲的中国专家和技术工人默哀致敬。
    阮春水指出，自越中友好协会成立十年、特别是最近五年来，越南和中国都发生了非常巨大的变化。他说，我们感到高兴的是，十年来，中国人民在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，取得了非常重大的胜利。目前，中国农村已经成为人民公社的农村，城市也正在组织人民公社。他说，中华人民共和国的诞生和迅速壮大改变了亚洲的面貌，鼓舞了民族解放运动和被压迫人民的斗志，从而使世界力量的对比完全倒向和平和社会主义阵营。阮春水谴责美帝国主义侵占中国领土台湾，并支持中国人民解放中国领土台湾的权利。他说，中越两国人民当前的最危险的共同敌人正是侵略越南南方和占领台湾的美帝国主义。两国正在共同为社会主义和共产主义而奋斗，共同支持民族解放运动，共同为亚洲和世界和平而斗争。因此，两国人民必须紧密地团结起来。这种友谊关系是牢不可破的。他又说，美帝国主义不仅是越中两国人民最危险的敌人，而且是世界和平最危险的敌人。
    汪滔代办应邀在会上讲了话。他代表中国人民向这次充满兄弟友谊的大会，致以最诚挚、最热烈的祝贺。他接着说，越中友好协会已经为增强中越两国人民的兄弟友谊作出了积极的贡献，中国人民将永远感激这种贡献。他表示相信，中越友谊的花朵将永远鲜艳美丽。
    越中友好协会秘书长孙光阀向大会作了关于越中友好协会五年来工作的报告。他说，五年来，在以敬爱的胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的正确领导下，越中友协同各部门、各人民团体相配合，向越南人民进行了介绍中国的宣传活动，并取得了一定的成绩。在谈到越中友好协会今后的工作方向时，孙光阀说，我们的方向是：继续以无产阶级国际主义同真正的爱国主义相结合的精神教育人民；扩大同中国各个组织和个人之间的联系和文化交流；在各个经济和文化基层组织中发展组织。大会接着听取了黎辉云关于修改会章的报告和越中友好协会副会长陈辉燎关于参加中国庆祝越南民主共和国成立十五周年活动的报告。陈辉燎在大会上宣读了北京中越友好人民公社打给河内越中友好农业社的电报。在宣读电报的时候，全体代表报以热烈的掌声。
