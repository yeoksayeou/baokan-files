Plan Several Steps Ahead for Proactive Initiative
    Zuogou Brigade Staggers Agricultural Activities for Orderly Autumn Harvest
    (According to a report in the Henan Daily) The Zuogou Brigade of the Beiwudu Commune in Wuyang County, Henan Province, in leading production, always grasps with both hands and plans several steps ahead. As a result, their work is proactive, and the autumn harvest is unhurried, efficient, and of good quality.
    Autumn harvest is a busy and intense season for agricultural production throughout the year, but this year's autumn harvest and planting in the Zuogou Brigade are neither crowded nor chaotic. One reason is that they had already planned and arranged this during the planting of late autumn crops. The summer sowing area was large this year, which brought heavy tasks for the autumn harvest and planting. In particular, most of the crops are late-autumn crops, with concentrated harvesting and planting times, and the labor-intensive sweet potato storage. If this were not foreseen early, they would inevitably be caught off guard. The Zuogou Brigade, due to its ability to plan several steps ahead, decided that this year's late autumn crops should include some early-maturing varieties. This would allow the autumn harvest and autumn plowing to be staggered, avoiding the situation where crops ripen at the same time, leading to labor and animal power shortages and causing some grain losses. Because the summer sowing this year included crops that matured at different times, management could also be separated, allowing sufficient time for careful and detailed management. The autumn harvest could be more thorough, and the fields could be cleared and autumn plowing done early, making wheat planting proactive and overcoming the past phenomenon of crowded farm work, neglecting one thing while attending to another. Recently, autumn production has entered its busiest phase, but the brigade's production is proceeding in an orderly manner: harvesting millet, then mung beans, then soybeans, then buckwheat. After buckwheat is harvested, late sweet potatoes ripen. After finishing the first batch of work, the second batch emerges, without crowding, rushing, or conflict. The commune members also get adequate rest and are not flustered at all. The commune members happily say, "We made the right move!"
    Having made the right move, they also look ahead to the next move. As early as mid-August, before the autumn work began, the Zuogou Brigade Party Branch convened an agricultural advisory meeting with the participation of experienced farmers and technicians to carefully study how to carry out this year's autumn work. This study not only made detailed analyses of this year's autumn harvest and planting, but also considered and arranged for winter and spring wheat field management and next year's summer harvest and planting. They researched five methods to strive for a better wheat harvest next year: First, crop rotation. Old sloping fields that have been frequently planted with wheat should be rotated as much as possible and planted with summer miscellaneous grains. Second, planting based on preceding crops. Wheat can be planted on land where mung beans, sesame, early-maturing soybeans, and all early autumn crops were planted because the soil fertility is less depleted. Late-maturing soybean and corn stalks are planted with summer miscellaneous grains, and sweet potato and buckwheat stalks are planted with lentils and peas. A portion of the sweet potato and late millet stalks are left fallow in the autumn. This ensures that wheat is planted on land suitable for its growth and also adapts to wheat's preference for early planting. Third, avoid using only one variety. Of the brigade's 1,350 mu of wheat, it is planned to plant 700 mu of winter wheat (Hongmang Cao, Youzitou), 600 mu of semi-winter wheat (Nanda 2419, 6028), and 50 mu of Bima No. 1; 1,000 mu of summer miscellaneous grains, planned to plant 100 mu of early-maturing Sanyue Huang, 500 mu of late-maturing peas, and 400 mu of medium-maturing lentils. This allows for both staggered planting and staggered harvesting, avoiding crowding during planting and harvesting. Fourth, plant more crops with high yields and good stubble. For example, Youzitou wheat is mixed with peas, which not only yields high, but also provides good stubble. Planting late autumn crops on this land yields 10% to 20% more than other stubble types. Therefore, the area for these two varieties should be expanded as much as possible. Fifth, make every effort to apply more base fertilizer. Due to insufficient animal power for transporting fertilizer, a method of applying crude fertilizer near the village and chemical fertilizer and soil fertilizer in distant sloping fields is adopted, and these tasks are also arranged early.
    After the Zuogou Brigade adopted the leadership method of "planning several steps ahead," the cadres deeply realized that leading agricultural production requires being good at observing wind direction, checking climate, knowing oneself and one's opponent, and looking three steps ahead after taking one step. Only in this way can we fight the production battle beautifully, achieve victory step by step, and make work proactive step by step. Now, they are summarizing this method, continuing to do a good job in autumn harvest and planting, and continuing to study the ingenious ways to play the next move.

### 多看几步棋  事事能主动  左沟大队错开农事活动时间三秋生产有条不紊

    多看几步棋  事事能主动
    左沟大队错开农事活动时间三秋生产有条不紊
    据河南日报消息　河南舞阳县北舞渡公社左沟大队，在领导生产中处处两手抓，善走多步棋，工作因此主动，三秋生产从容不迫，效率高，质量也好。
    三秋生产是一年中农业生产紧张繁忙的季节，而左沟大队今年的秋收秋种，既不拥挤，又不忙乱。原因之一是他们早在种晚秋时就有了打算，做好了安排。今年夏播面积大，这就给秋收秋种带来繁重的任务，特别是绝大部分是晚秋作物，收种时间集中，更兼甘薯收藏费工，如不及早预见到这一点，势必临时会措手不及。左沟大队由于善走几步棋，决定今年晚秋要多种一部分早熟作物，这样好使秋收和秋耕能拉开时间，避免因品种一致一齐成熟，劳、畜力不足而造成某些粮食损失的现象发生。由于今年夏播时安排了不同的时期成熟的作物，因此在管理上也可以前后分开，有了充分时间精管细管；收秋更能细收，同时又能早腾茬、早秋耕，种麦主动，克服了过去所说的“麦忙不算忙，要忙豆叶黄”的农活拥挤、顾东丢西的现象。最近三秋生产已经进入大忙，全队的生产却有条不紊：割罢谷子割绿豆、割罢绿豆割黄豆，割罢黄豆割荞麦，荞麦收完晚薯熟，做了头批活，出来第二批活，不拥不挤不矛盾。社员休息也充足，丝毫不忙乱。社员们都高兴地说：“咱算走对了这步棋！”
    走对了上步棋，还看透了下步棋。早在三秋工作没开始的8月中旬，左沟大队党支部就召开了有老农、技术员参加的农业参谋会，细致研究了今年三秋工作如何开展问题。这次研究不仅对今年的秋收秋种作了详尽的分析，而且还对冬春的麦田管理和明年的夏收夏种作了考虑和安排。他们对争取明年麦子多收研究出了五项办法：一，轮作。对于过去经常种麦的老坡地要尽量轮换，种上夏杂粮。二，因茬种植。对于绿豆、芝麻、早熟豆茬和一切早秋作物茬口，因地力消耗少可种上麦子。晚熟豆茬、玉米茬种夏杂粮，甘薯、荞麦茬种扁豆和豌豆。一部分甘薯茬和晚谷茬丢秋地。这样既能使麦子种上适宜生长的茬口地，又能够适应小麦喜早种的特性。三，使用品种不单一。全队一千三百五十亩小麦，计划种冬性麦（红芒糙、蚰子头）七百亩，半冬性麦（南大二四一九、六○二八）六百亩，碧蚂一号五十亩；一千亩夏杂粮，计划种早熟三月黄一百亩，晚熟豌豆五百亩，中熟扁豆四百亩。这样既能分期播种，又能分期收割，避免种、收活路拥挤。四，多种产量高茬口好的作物。如蚰子头小麦种和豌豆混作，不但产量高，而且茬口又好，种上晚秋，同样的地力都比别的茬口多收10％到20％。因此，这两样品种面积要尽量扩大。五，尽力多施底肥。运肥畜力不足，采用近地施粗肥，远坡地施化肥和土化肥的办法，这些工作也及早做好了安排。
    左沟大队采取“多走几步棋”的领导方法后，使干部深深体会到：领导农业生产必须善观风向、查气候，知己知彼，走一看三。只有这样，才能把生产仗打得漂亮，步步取得胜利，才能使工作步步主动。现在，他们正在总结这种方法，继续搞好秋收秋种，继续研究下步棋的巧妙走法。
