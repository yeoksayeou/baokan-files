Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 15th. Cuban newspapers today published the contents of the Urban Reform Law promulgated by the Cuban cabinet. This law stipulates that every family in Cuba has the right to obtain decent housing, and the state will realize this right in stages.

    The current first stage is: renters become the owners of the houses they live in, paying off the house price in monthly installments of rent, with payment periods ranging from five to twenty years. After the house price is paid off, the former landlords generally begin to receive a lifetime living allowance from the state as compensation, the amount of which is equal to the rent they received in the past. The law also stipulates that large landlords cannot receive more than 600 pesos per month from the homeowners. The excess part is handed over to the state.

    The law stipulates that in the second stage, the state will use the funds obtained from the implementation of this law and other funds to build a large number of houses, and grant the permanent right to use the houses to the homeowners by accepting payments from them that do not exceed 10% of their income each month.

    In the third stage, the state will use its funds to build houses and grant the permanent right to use the houses to the homeowners free of charge.

    The law also stipulates that the state will finally resolve the social problem of the so-called slums in the shortest possible time. To this end, the funds obtained from the implementation of this law will be used.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th. According to a report from Prensa Latina, Havana, 11th: To commemorate the ninety-second anniversary of Cuba's declaration of war against Spanish colonialists on October 10, the Cuban National Land Reform Committee issued 1,170 land certificates to farmers in the three days from the 9th to the 11th.

    In the provinces of Matanzas, Camaguey, and Oriente, thousands of farmers who participated in the land certificate issuance meetings expressed their support for the revolutionary government and demanded the execution of the counter-revolutionaries who recently landed in Navas Bay in Oriente Province and carried out rebellious activities in the Escambray Mountains under the organization and support of the United States and were captured.

    Staff members of the National Land Reform Committee announced that land certificates will be issued to farmers in some areas again in December.

    新华社哈瓦那15日电　古巴各报今天刊载了古巴内阁颁布的城市改革法的内容。这项法律规定，古巴的每一个家庭都有取得正当的住房的权利，国家将分阶段实现它们的这个权利。
    目前的第一阶段是：租房者成为他们居住的房屋的业主，以每月的房租分期偿付房价，付款期为五年至二十年不等。到房价付完以后，一般的前房东开始得到由国家付给他们的作为赔偿费的终身生活津贴，其数目与过去他们所得的房租相等。法律还规定，大房东从住房者那里得到的款项不能超过每月六百比索。多余的部分交给国家。
    法律规定，在第二阶段中，国家将用由于执行这项法律所得到的资金和其他资金大量建造住房，并且通过接受住房者每月付给的不超过其收入10％的款项，给予住房者以住宅的永久使用权。
    在第三阶段中，国家将用它的资金建造住宅，并且无偿地给予住房者以房屋的永久使用权。
    法律还规定，国家将在尽可能短的时间内，最后解决存在所谓贫民区这个社会问题。为此将动用由于执行这项法律而得到的资金。
    新华社13日讯　据拉丁美洲通讯社哈瓦那11日消息：为了纪念10月10日古巴宣布展开反对西班牙殖民主义者战争第九十二周年纪念日，古巴土地改革全国委员会从9日到11日的三天中发给农民一千一百七十张土地证。
    在马坦萨斯、卡马圭、奥连特等省，数以千计的参加颁发土地证会议的农民，都表示支持革命政府，并且要求处决在美国组织和支持下最近在奥连特省纳瓦斯湾登陆以及在埃斯坎布拉伊山区进行叛乱活动而被俘的反革命分子。
    土地改革全国委员会的工作人员宣布，在12月份将再发给一些地区的农民以土地证。
