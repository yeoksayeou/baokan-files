Xinhua News Agency, 11th, New York: The United Nations General Assembly continued its general debate on the morning and afternoon of the 10th.

    President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea spoke first, accusing the imperialists of trying to maintain the colonial system. He said that all attempts to persecute the people of colonial countries economically and politically are doomed to failure. The people of Africa are shattering the shackles of slavery, and what used to be the land of colonial forces and rule is now a new battleground for the awakened people of all countries to strive for a better future.

    Touré strongly condemned the colonialists' unwillingness to abandon their contemptuous attitude towards the people of underdeveloped countries. He said that if racial discrimination and great power chauvinism are not ended, it will be impossible to solve the most important problems of our time.

    Touré pointed out that many African countries have now achieved independence, which is a profound change brought about by arduous struggle. Imperialists are now changing their tactics of suppressing national liberation movements, while still resorting to violent means of military suppression. For example, France is waging a colonial war in Algeria, South African police authorities are terrifyingly killing and suppressing peaceful residents of the Union of South Africa, and Portugal is colluding with other countries to suppress national liberation movements in Angola, Mozambique, and so-called Portuguese Guinea. In addition, the colonialists are preparing new provocations in Central Africa.

    Touré emphasized that, at the same time, various forms of economic exploitation still exist. Colonialists, on the one hand, internationally recognize the flags and national anthems of many new countries, but on the other hand, they cling tightly to their economic status. Touré stressed that without the economic independence of African countries, there can be no social progress. He said that for many years, the economy of the colonies has been dependent on the suzerain states, and it has all the characteristics of colonialism.

    Touré pointed out the economic consequences brought to African countries by long-term colonial rule. He said that the struggle of these countries for economic independence has just begun, and we must arm ourselves in order to carry this struggle to the end. In this struggle, we should first rely on ourselves and mobilize our strength to eliminate the remnants of past colonial rule.

    Touré also condemned the establishment of military bases by imperialist countries in Africa. He pointed out that imperialist countries are concentrating their efforts on military base plans and believe that these military bases are "indispensable" for expansionist purposes.

    Touré said that imperialism is trying to control Africa. We must be careful about the congratulations expressed by imperialists on the admission of new countries to the United Nations. They want to pull new countries to their side and use them to achieve their selfish goals.

    Referring to the situation in the Congo, Touré accused Belgium and other colonial countries of undermining the freedom and sovereignty of the Congo. He also accused the United Nations of using so-called "aid" to create and exacerbate the chaotic situation in the Congo and oppose the legitimate central government of the Congo. He said that we call on all countries to effectively defend the laws of the Congo.

    Touré finally elaborated on the Guinean government's position on some current international issues. He emphasized that Guinea advocates complete and thorough disarmament; advocates a solemn declaration to immediately eliminate colonialism and the trusteeship system; demands that the Congolese delegation sent by the Lumumba government obtain the seat of the Congo in the United Nations General Assembly; and advocates the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

    At the afternoon meeting, Kamil, head of the Malaysian delegation, spoke first. He once again acted as a vanguard in the US smear campaign against China, wantonly slandering China on the so-called "Tibet issue," saying that the Chinese government "trampled on Tibet," "suppressed" the Tibetan people, and "consistently ignored the basic human rights of the Tibetan people." He also praised the UN Secretary-General's activities in helping the United States to invade the Congo.

    Tunisian representative Slim spoke about the Algerian issue. He condemned the actions of the French government and expressed support for the Algerian Provisional Government. When talking about the situation in the Congo, he once again defended the UN's intervention in the Congo.

    U Thant, head of the Burmese delegation, reiterated the Burmese government's determination to pursue a neutral policy. He expressed dissatisfaction with the decision made by the UN General Assembly on the issue of Chinese representation. He said that this decision "shows our inability to recognize the signs of the times and shows our unwillingness to face reality." U Thant also expressed regret over the US government's outright rejection of Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Pacific region.

    Referring to the Algerian issue, U Thant accused the French government of only talking about "self-determination" in words, but actually refusing to grant the Algerian people the right to self-determination. U Thant pointed out that despite six years of "appeasement" by the French government, the Algerian National Liberation Army is today stronger, better organized and better equipped than before.

    几内亚总统杜尔在联大全体会议上发言指出
    非洲人民决心要清除殖民主义
    指责帝国主义力图控制非洲和联合国利用所谓“援助”反对刚果合法政府
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议10日上午和下午继续进行一般性辩论。
    几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔首先发言，指责帝国主义者力图维持殖民制度。他说，经济上和政治上迫害殖民地各国人民的一切企图是注定要失败的。非洲各国人民正在粉碎奴役的枷锁，那里过去是殖民主义势力和统治的天地，而现在是觉悟了的各国人民争取美好未来的新的战斗场所。
    杜尔强烈谴责殖民主义者不想放弃对不发达国家人民所采取的轻蔑态度。他说，如果不终止种族歧视和大国沙文主义，那末，要想解决我们时代最重要的问题是不可能的。
    杜尔指出，许多非洲国家现在已经取得了独立，这是经过顽强斗争所带来的深刻变化。帝国主义者现在改变了它们镇压民族解放运动的策略，同时也仍在采取军事镇压的暴力手段。例如法国在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争，南非警察当局恐怖地杀害和镇压南非联邦的和平居民，葡萄牙同其他国家勾结在一起镇压安哥拉、莫三鼻给和所谓葡萄牙几内亚的民族解放运动。此外，殖民主义者还准备在中非进行新的挑衅。
    杜尔强调指出，同时，各种形式的经济剥削依然存在。殖民主义者一方面在国际上承认许多新的国家的国旗和国歌，但是另一方面却紧抓着它们的经济地位不放。杜尔强调说，没有非洲国家的经济独立，就不可能有任何社会进步。他说，许多年来，殖民地的经济依赖宗主国，它具有殖民主义的一切特征。
    杜尔指出了长期的殖民主义统治给非洲国家带来的经济恶果。他说，这些国家争取经济独立的斗争刚刚开始，我们要武装起来，以便把这个斗争进行到底。在这个斗争中我们首先应当依靠自己，动员力量来消除过去的殖民主义统治的残余。
    杜尔还谴责帝国主义国家在非洲建立军事基地。他指出，帝国主义国家正在把力量集中在军事基地的计划上，并且认为这些军事基地对扩张主义的目的是“必不可少”的。
    杜尔说，帝国主义力图控制非洲。必须小心看待帝国主义者就接纳新国家加入联合国表示的祝贺。他们想把新国家拉到自己方面，利用它们来实现自私自利的目的。
    杜尔在谈到刚果局势时指责比利时和其他殖民主义国家破坏刚果的自由和主权的行动。他还指责联合国利用所谓“援助”来制造和加剧刚果的混乱状态和反对刚果合法的中央政府。他说，我们呼吁一切国家有效地捍卫刚果的法律。
    杜尔最后阐明了几内亚政府对当前一些国际问题的立场。他强调指出，几内亚主张全面和彻底裁军；主张庄严地宣布立即消灭殖民主义和托管制度；要求由卢蒙巴政府派来的刚果代表团取得刚果在联合国大会的席位；主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利。
    在下午会议上，马来亚代表团团长卡米勒第一个发言。他再次充当美国蔑诬中国的运动的急先锋，就所谓“西藏问题”大肆诽谤中国，说什么中国政府“蹂躏西藏”、“镇压”西藏人民和“一贯忽视西藏人民的基本人权”。他还赞扬联合国秘书长帮助美国侵略刚果的活动。
    突尼斯代表斯陵在发言时谈到了阿尔及利亚问题。他谴责了法国政府的行为，并且表示支持阿尔及利亚临时政府。他在谈到刚果局势时，再次为联合国干涉刚果的活动辩护。
    缅甸代表团团长吴丹在发言时重申缅甸政府决心推行中立政策。他对联合国大会本届会议关于中国代表权问题作出的决定表示不满。他说，这个决定“表明我们无能辨认时代的迹象，表明我们不愿正视现实”。吴丹还对美国政府断然拒绝中国周恩来总理提出的关于建立太平洋地区无核武器区的建议表示遗憾。
    谈到阿尔及利亚问题，吴丹指责法国政府只是在口头上谈“自决”，实际上却拒绝给予阿尔及利亚人民以自决的权利。吴丹指出，尽管经过了法国政府六年的“绥靖”，阿尔及利亚民族解放军今天已比以前更为强大，更有组织和拥有更好的装备。
