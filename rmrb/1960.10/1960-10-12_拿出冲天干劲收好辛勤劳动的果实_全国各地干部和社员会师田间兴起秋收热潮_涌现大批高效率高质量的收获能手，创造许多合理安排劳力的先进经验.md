Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch: Amidst the high tide of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, autumn harvesting work is being carried out comprehensively across the country. Early autumn crops in various regions have been basically harvested, and the focus has shifted to harvesting late autumn crops. In areas north of the Yellow River, most late autumn crops have been harvested, while in southern regions, the single-season late rice and other crops are also being harvested.

This year's autumn harvest task is more arduous than in any previous year. Under the guidance of the Party's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, various regions have further implemented the policy of simultaneously pursuing diverse yields and increased yields. They have universally expanded the planting area of ​​autumn-ripening crops, increased the cultivation area of ​​high-yield plots, widely promoted intercropping, relay cropping, mixed cropping, multiple cropping, and large-scale planting on "ten edges" and vacant lands, thus greatly increasing the autumn harvest workload. At the same time, various regions, implementing the policy of taking grain as the key link and promoting overall development, have increased the variety of autumn harvest crops. Grain, cotton, oil, hemp, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruits, etc., all need to be harvested in a timely, concentrated, and complete manner during this season, making the autumn harvest task even more significant. However, the nationwide mass movement to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production has brought many favorable conditions to this year's autumn harvest work. Various regions have universally strengthened the leadership force at the forefront of the autumn harvest, and have concentrated, comprehensively, and rationally arranged rural labor forces, and mobilized a large number of manpower and material resources from all fronts to support the autumn harvest.

On the fields and threshing grounds of people's communes across the country, one can see many cadres and commune members working side by side. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, starting with Ulanhu, the First Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, a total of more than 170,000 leaders at all levels and commune members are harvesting various crops together. In Jilin Province, the provincial leading organs alone have transferred more than 5,000 cadres to the front lines to participate in and lead the autumn harvest. The autumn harvest front in various regions not only has more troops, but also a wider range of them. In the northeastern provinces, where the entire year's harvesting work is almost entirely concentrated in the autumn season, the labor force participating in the autumn harvest accounts for more than 80% of the total rural labor force. In areas where the autumn harvest and autumn planting are progressing simultaneously, overall arrangements have been made to concentrate the labor force on both the harvest and planting fronts, and professional teams have been organized to give full play to the strengths of each worker, ensuring that neither the autumn harvest nor the autumn planting is delayed. People's communes in the five regions of Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde in Hebei Province have organized more than 54,000 autumn harvest professional teams with 1.12 million participants. People's communes in the WuHu, Anqing, Liu'an, and Hefei regions of Anhui Province have organized a total of more than 49,000 harvest, transport, and threshing professional teams with 1.16 million participants. These professional teams have played a significant role in accelerating the progress of the autumn harvest and improving the quality of operations. Various regions have also mobilized tens of thousands of people from various departments in cities and towns to support the autumn harvest. The two provinces of Heilongjiang and Liaoning have organized nearly five million people from all walks of life in cities and towns to support the rush harvest, including cadres, workers, shop assistants, students, officers and soldiers of the garrison, and urban residents. They bring their own tools and participate in the autumn harvest in the people's communes.

Harvesting in a timely and clean manner is the central requirement put forward by the leading organs in various regions for the autumn harvest work. This year is the year with the most natural disasters since the founding of our country. Roughly more than half of the cultivated land area nationwide has been successively attacked by natural disasters such as drought, flood, typhoon, hail, and insects. However, under the leadership of the Party, the people's communes have brought into play the powerful force of resisting natural disasters. The broad masses of commune members have fought heroically and tenaciously against natural disasters, reducing the disaster-affected area to only one-third of the disaster-stricken area. Many areas that were less affected by the disaster still won a better harvest, and the areas that were severely affected by the disaster also greatly reduced the harm caused by the disaster, achieving a great victory in the fight against the disaster. On the basis of this victory, the broad masses of commune members continue to strive, with soaring enthusiasm for resisting disasters and ensuring harvests, to gather all the fruits of labor without leaving a single grain or discarding a single plant. Various regions have universally launched labor competitions between communes, teams, and work groups, as well as between different types of work and processes. A large number of high-efficiency, high-quality harvesting experts have emerged, creating advanced experiences in one-stop operations that tightly link harvesting, transporting, threshing, and storing, achieving fast harvesting, clean transportation, fine threshing, and good storage. In Zhongwei County, Ningxia, the people's communes divided all commune members into seven armies according to their labor strength, technical expertise, and the distance of the land, including harvesting, bundling, pulling, picking, and threshing. Each had its own responsibilities, contracted to the end, launched separate assaults, and competed with each other, ensuring the overall smooth progress of each link in the autumn harvest work. People's communes in Nanyang and Kaifeng regions of Henan Province have also arranged manpower according to the specific situation of inconsistent maturity periods of intercropped and relay-cropped crops, adopting the method of harvesting the ripe crops first, harvesting the late-ripening crops later, harvesting the ripe plants, and harvesting the ripe ears, achieving both good harvesting and good protection (protecting the unripe crops), avoiding losses. Various regions have organized a portion of auxiliary labor to pick up fallen plants and grains piece by piece, and implement re-threshing, striving for clean fields, clean threshing grounds, and every grain being stored in the granary. In the three provinces of Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Jilin, which were more severely affected by floods, while focusing on grain harvesting, they are advancing in all directions towards fields, mountains, and waters, closely combining the large autumn harvest with the small autumn harvest, and are determined to harvest all harvestable plants and wild plants.

During the autumn harvest, various regions not only maximize the power of people, but also pay attention to giving full play to the role of various tools, especially improved tools, semi-mechanized and mechanized tools. This is also an important factor in improving the efficiency and quality of autumn harvest operations. Guizhou Province, a major hemp-producing area, has promoted a simple hemp scraping machine created by the local people, which is more than three times more efficient than manual hemp scraping. In Anhui Province alone, more than 300,000 new-style threshing tools have been promoted, all of which have the characteristics of high efficiency and thorough threshing.

Various regions have also combined the autumn harvest work with preparations for next year's production, and have universally carried out seed selection, and have already selected a large number of excellent varieties. Many communes in the Northeast region have closely linked autumn plowing with autumn harvesting, harvesting one piece and plowing one piece, creating conditions for increasing grain production next year.

    拿出冲天干劲收好辛勤劳动的果实
    全国各地干部和社员会师田间兴起秋收热潮
    涌现大批高效率高质量的收获能手，创造许多合理安排劳力的先进经验
    新华社11日讯　在大办农业，大办粮食运动的高潮中，全国各地全面地进行秋收工作。各地的早秋作物已经基本上收完，普遍转入收获大秋作物，黄河以北地区的大秋作物已收割大半，南方地区也开镰收获单季晚稻等作物。
    今年的秋收任务比以往任何一年都要繁重。各地在党的以农业为基础方针的指导下，今年进一步贯彻执行了多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针，普遍扩大了秋熟作物的播种面积，增加了丰产方的培植面积，广泛地推行了间种、套种、混种、复种和大种“十边”隙地，因而大大增加了秋收工作量。同时，各地执行以粮为纲、全面发展的方针，增多了秋收作物的种类，粮、棉、油、麻、糖、菜、烟、果等，都需要在这个季节里及时地、集中地和全部地收到手，也使秋收任务更加重大。但是，全国范围的大办农业，大办粮食的群众运动，给今年的秋收工作带来了许多有利的条件。各地普遍加强了秋收第一线的领导力量，并且集中地、全面地、合理地安排了农村劳动力，并且从各个战线动员大批人力、物力支援秋收。
    在各地人民公社的田野和打谷场上，都可以看到许多干部和社员们并肩劳动。内蒙古自治区从自治区党委第一书记乌兰夫起，共有十七万多名各级领导干部和社员一道收割各种作物。吉林省光是省级领导机关就抽调了五千多名干部，分赴第一线，参加秋收，领导秋收。各地的秋收战线，不仅将多，而且兵更广。全年的收获工作几乎全部集中在秋季的东北各省，参加秋收的劳动力都占到农村劳动力总数的80％以上。秋收、秋种齐头并进的地区，都经过统筹安排，将劳动力集中到收、种两条战线，并且组织专业队，充分发挥每个劳动力的特长，保证秋收、秋种两不误。河北省的保定、石家庄、唐山、张家口、承德五个地区的人民公社，组织了五万四千多个、有一百一十二万人参加的秋收专业队。安徽省的芜湖、安庆、六安和合肥地区的人民公社，共组织了有一百一十六万人参加的四万九千多个收、运、脱粒专业队。这些专业队对加快秋收进度，提高作业质量起了显著作用。各地还从城镇各部门动员了成千上万的人力支援秋收。黑龙江、辽宁两个省就从城市各行各业中组织了近五百万名支援抢收的大军，其中有干部、工人、店员、学生、驻军官兵和城镇居民，他们自带工具，到人民公社参加秋收。
    收得及时，收得干净，是各地领导机关对秋收工作提出的中心要求。今年，是我国建国以来自然灾害最大的一年，全国大体有半数以上的耕地面积，先后遭到旱、涝、台风、雹、虫等自然灾害的侵袭。但是在党的领导下，人民公社发挥了抗击自然灾害的强大威力，广大社员同天灾作了英勇顽强的搏斗，使成灾面积缩小到仅占受灾面积的三分之一，许多受灾较轻的地区仍然夺得了较好的收成，受灾较重的地方也大大减轻了灾害的为害程度，取得了抗灾斗争的巨大胜利。在这个胜利的基础上，广大社员继续以抗灾保收的冲天干劲，千方百计力争把所有的劳动果实一粒不漏，一棵不丢地收到手。各地普遍开展了社与社、队与队、作业组与作业组之间，以及不同工种、工序之间的劳动竞赛，涌现了大批高效率、高质量的收获能手，创造了割、运、打、储等环环扣紧的一条龙作业的先进经验，作到了收得快，运得净，打得细，藏得好。宁夏中卫县各人民公社将全体社员按劳力强弱、技术特长和土地远近等情况，分别组成割、捆、拉、拾、打等七路大军，各有专责，包干到底，分头突击，互相竞赛，保证了秋收工作每个环节都全面顺利进展。河南省南阳、开封等地区的人民公社，还根据间作、套种的田里作物成熟期不一致的具体情况，安排人力，采取先熟先收，后熟后收，棵熟收棵，朵熟收朵，作到了收、护（保护尚未成熟的庄稼）双好，避免了损失。各地都组织一部分辅助劳力逐块拾拣脱落的棵粒，并且实行复打，争取地光，场净，粒粒归仓。受涝灾较重的黑龙江、辽宁、吉林三省，以收粮为主，向田、山、水全面进军，大秋收、小秋收紧密结合，要把一切可以收获的种植物和野生植物通通收起来。
    秋收中，各地不仅尽最大可能发挥人的力量，同时注意充分发挥各种工具，特别是改良工具、半机械化和机械化工具的作用。这也是提高秋收作业效率和质量的重要因素。贵州省主要麻产区推广了一种当地群众创造的简易刮麻机，工效比单纯手工刮麻高三倍多。安徽省单是推广新式脱粒工具一项即达三十多万件，这些工具都具有工效高、脱粒净的特点。
    各地还结合秋收工作为明年的生产作准备，普遍地进行了选种，已经选出一大批优良品种。东北地区的许多公社将秋耕工作和秋收工作紧紧衔接，收一块，耕一块，为明年增产粮食创造条件。（附图片）
