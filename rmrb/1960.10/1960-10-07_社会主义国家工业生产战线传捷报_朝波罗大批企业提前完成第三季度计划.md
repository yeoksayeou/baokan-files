Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th: The Korean working class, riding the Chollima (Thousand-Li Horse), responded to the call of the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee's August Plenary Session and launched a full-scale technical innovation movement, which promoted the development of production. By September 25th, more than 50 factories and mines in the heavy industry sector alone had completed their third quarter production plans ahead of schedule. Thirty-one light industrial factories and enterprises also completed their plans ahead of schedule.

Northern Korean steelworkers fought hard in the third quarter. They overcame high temperatures, innovated technology, greatly improved equipment utilization, and increased the average monthly steel output in the third quarter by 40% compared to the same period last year.

The Chengjin Steel Plant, famous for producing special steel, overfulfilled its steel and rolled steel production plan for the third quarter by 28% without increasing manpower or production equipment. In the first nine months of this year, the plant produced 2.6 times the amount of high-speed steel compared to the same period last year. The steelworkers of this plant launched a rapid steelmaking campaign, adopted a series of advanced technologies, reduced the time for each furnace of steelmaking in the third quarter by 10 minutes compared to the first quarter of this year, and increased the daily steel output in the third quarter by 70 to 80 tons compared to the same period last year, equivalent to six times that before liberation. Now, the steelworkers of this factory are striving to produce 15,000 tons of steel more than originally planned before the end of the year.

The steelworkers of the Hwanghae Iron Works, the largest steel producer in northern Korea, increased the steel produced per square meter of furnace bottom in the No. 1, 2, and 3 open-hearth furnaces by 12%, 14%, and 10% respectively in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. In addition, in this quarter, the steelworkers also successfully injected molten iron directly into the No. 3 and 4 open-hearth furnaces for steelmaking.

The Black Ridge, Hengfeng, Quancheng, and Yongan coal mines also completed their third quarter coal mining plans five to ten days ahead of schedule, respectively. Workers at the Black Ridge Coal Mine expanded the electric car lines in the mine and concentrated loaders and coal cutters on the main mining faces, improving coal mining efficiency. Workers at the Hengfeng Coal Mine increased the level of mechanization of coal transportation and coal mining operations by 20% and 40% respectively. This coal mine has overfulfilled its third quarter plan by 11%.

In the machinery industry sector, six factories have already overfulfilled their third quarter plans.

During this period, the hydroelectric power stations in northern Korea improved their flood season water management and increased the overall automation level of power generation equipment and the efficiency of turbines, supplying an average of 7 million kilowatt-hours more electricity per day than the national plan in the third quarter.

In the textile industry, which occupies a major position in light industry, eleven cotton mills and silk mills had completed their third quarter plans by September 25th. The silk production plan for the third quarter had been completed by 103% by September 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 5th: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, the Polish heavy industry sector has overfulfilled its production plan for the first nine months of this year by 2.3%. The annual plan has been completed by 76.4%.

Compared to the first three quarters of last year, the production of the heavy industry sector has increased by 15%.

In September, the metallurgical industry achieved particularly remarkable results, with production plans for all major products being overfulfilled.

Polish coal miners victoriously completed their production plan for the first three quarters of this year ahead of schedule on September 23rd, mining a total of approximately 74,343,000 tons of coal. Compared to the same period last year, the labor productivity of miners has greatly improved. The average daily output per miner has increased by 42 kilograms compared to last year.

It is estimated that Polish miners will mine approximately 3 million tons of coal more than planned for the entire year.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 5th: Many industrial enterprises in Romania have completed their production plans for the first three quarters of this year ahead of schedule.

The second blast furnace workshop, the first open-hearth furnace workshop, the electric furnace workshop, and a steel rolling workshop of the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine all completed their production plans for the first three quarters four to seven days ahead of schedule. The new blast furnace workshop has produced more than 13,000 tons of pig iron over the plan since the beginning of the year, saving more than 70 million lei (Romanian currency).

Enterprises under the Ministry of Petroleum and Chemical Industry, national drilling enterprises, and timber industry enterprises have all completed their production plans or gross output value plans for the first three quarters ahead of schedule. These enterprises have also saved a large amount of funds for the country. For example, enterprises under the Ministry of Petroleum and Chemical Industry had saved more than 57 million lei by September 1st.

Many textile factories, knitting factories, metal processing factories, machine manufacturing factories, food factories, etc., have also completed their production plans for the first three quarters ahead of schedule. The Ernst Thälmann Tractor Factory completed its plan for the first three quarters eight days ahead of schedule.

The promotion of new technologies and the implementation of innovation proposals are important factors for many industrial enterprises in Romania to complete their production plans ahead of schedule. After adopting advanced ironmaking methods, the second blast furnace workshop of the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine has increased the average iron output per cubic meter of blast furnace volume to more than one ton, and created the highest production record in the history of the workshop in August. Petroleum drilling enterprises actively promoted the turbine drilling method, thereby greatly accelerating the drilling speed, and drilled 24,000 meters more than planned in the first eight months of this year. The petroleum and chemical industry sector put forward more than 27,000 innovation proposals in the first half of this year, an increase of 20% compared to the same period last year.

    社会主义国家工业生产战线传捷报
    朝波罗大批企业提前完成第三季度计划
    据新华社平壤6日电　骑上千里马的朝鲜工人阶级，响应朝鲜劳动党中央八月全会的号召，全面展开了技术革新运动，推动了生产的发展。到9月25日为止，单是重工业部门就有五十多个厂矿提前完成了今年第三季度的生产计划。提前完成计划的还有三十一家轻工业工厂和企业。
    朝鲜北部钢铁工人奋战第三季度，他们战胜了高温、革新了技术，大大提高了设备利用率，使第三季度每月的平均钢产量比去年同时期增长了40％。
    以生产特殊钢而闻名的城津炼钢厂在没有增加劳动力和生产设备的条件下，超额28％完成了第三季度的钢和钢材的生产计划。这个厂头九个月生产的高速钢的产量达到去年同时期的二点六倍。这个厂的炼钢工人展开了快速炼钢运动，采用了一系列的先进技术，使第三季度每炼一炉钢的时间比今年第一季度缩短了十分钟，使第三季度钢的日产量比去年同时期增加了七十吨到八十吨，相当于解放前六倍。现在这个工厂的炼钢工人正为在年底以前比原计划多生产一万五千吨钢而奋斗。
    目前朝鲜北部生产钢最多的钢铁厂——黄海制铁所的炼钢工人，在第三季度使一、二、三号平炉的每平方米炉底生产的钢比去年同一时期提高了12％、14％、10％。另外，在这季度内，炼钢工人还在三号和四号平炉直接把铁水注入炉内炼钢，获得了成功。
    黑岭、衡峰、泉城、永安等煤矿也都分别提前五天到十天完成了第三季度的采煤计划。黑岭煤矿的工人扩大了井内的电车线路，把装载机和割煤机集中到主要的采煤工作面上，提高了采煤效率。衡峰煤矿的工人把运煤作业和采煤作业的机械化水平分别提高了20％和40％。这个煤矿已超额11％完成了第三季度计划。
    在机械工业部门中，已有六个工厂超额完成了第三季度计划。
    朝鲜北部各个水电站在这一期间改善了洪水期管理水的工作，并提高了发电设备的综合自动化水平和涡轮的效率，在第三季度内平均每天比国家计划多供应了七百万度电力。
    在轻工业中占主要地位的纺织工业，到9月25日已有十一家棉纺厂和丝绸厂完成了第三季度计划。第三季度的丝绸生产计划到9月20日已经完成了103％。
    新华社华沙5日电　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰重工业部门已经超额2.3％完成了今年头九个月的生产计划。全年计划已经完成了76.4％。
    同去年头三季相比，重工业部门的生产增加了15％。
    在9月份，冶金工业的成绩特别显著，所有主要产品的生产计划都超额完成了。
    波兰煤矿工人提前于9月23日胜利完成了今年头三个季度的生产计划，共采煤约七千四百三十四万三千吨。与去年同期相比，矿工劳动生产率有了很大的提高。每个矿工平均日产量比去年增加四十二公斤。
    预计，波兰矿工今年全年将超计划多开采大约三百万吨煤。
    新华社布加勒斯特5日电　罗马尼亚许多工业企业提前完成了今年头三个季度的生产计划。
    洪尼多阿拉冶金联合工厂的第二高炉车间、第一平炉车间、电炉车间和一个轧钢车间都提前四天到七天完成了头三个季度的生产计划。新高炉车间从年初到现在已经超计划生产了一万三千多吨生铁，节约了七千多万列伊（罗币名）。
    石油和化学工业部所属企业、全国钻井企业和木材工业企业都提前完成了头三季度的生产计划或总产值计划。这些企业还为国家节约了大量资金，例如石油和化学工业部所属企业到9月1日止已经节约了五千七百多万列伊。
    提前完成头三个季度生产计划的还有许多纺织厂、针织厂、金属加工厂、机器制造厂、食品厂等。恩斯特·台尔曼拖拉机工厂提前八天完成了头三季计划。
    推广新技术、实行革新建议是罗马尼亚许多工业企业提前完成生产计划的一个重要因素。洪尼多阿拉冶金联合工厂的第二高炉车间在采用先进的炼铁方法后，已把每立方米高炉容积的平均出铁量提高到一吨多，并在8月份创造了本车间历史上最高生产纪录。石油钻井企业积极推广了涡轮钻井法，从而大大加快了钻进速度，今年头八个月就超计划钻井二万四千米。石油和化学工业部门在今年上半年提出了二万七千多条革新建议，比去年同期增加20％。
