Jiangsu Strives to Avoid Late Planting of Late-Season Crops
According to statistics from Jiangsu Province as of the 26th, more than 6 million mu of late-season wheat have been planted. Generally, sufficient base fertilizer is applied, deep plowing and fine harrowing are carried out, and reasonable close planting is implemented. At present, various localities are continuing to rush planting, striving to avoid late planting of late-season crops, making late-season crops catch up with early-season crops, and completing the autumn planting plan on time to achieve a complete victory in autumn planting.

Henan Promotes Intercropping of Grain and Vegetables and Mixed Cropping of Wheat and Beans
Various localities in Henan are actively promoting "intercropping of grain and vegetables" and "mixed cropping of wheat and beans" during autumn planting. As of the 21st, more than 34% of the winter grain crops already sown in the province have implemented intercropping and mixed cropping.

Intercropping and mixed cropping in wheat fields require more bean seeds, vegetable seeds, and fertilizers. To meet this need, various localities are actively accumulating and producing fertilizer, and exchanging and purchasing seeds.

Heilongjiang Completes Harvesting of Autumn Crops
Heilongjiang Province has completed the harvesting of autumn crops, and various localities are rushing to pull the land, thresh, and carry out autumn plowing. This year's autumn harvest in the province is faster and better than any previous year. As the harvesting work entered the final stage, various localities also organized more than 1.3 million people to go to the fields to rush to pick up grain. A large amount of grain has now been picked up, and 71,000 tons of various vegetable and sugar beet leaves and tassels have been recovered.

Qinghai Begins Harvesting Rice
Rice planted in Qinghai Province has begun to be harvested. Judging from the harvesting and threshing in various localities, this year's rice harvest is generally good. The rice production situation this year shows that rice has great development prospects on the Qinghai Plateau.

This year, the areas and acreage of rice cultivation in Qinghai Province have expanded compared to previous years. In order to help Qinghai farmers quickly master rice cultivation techniques, Heilongjiang Province, which has similar conditions to Qinghai, sent ten farmer technicians to provide technical guidance.

Jilin and Hebei Widely Select Improved Varieties
Jilin and Hebei are widely selecting improved varieties during the autumn harvest. In some disaster-stricken areas where improved varieties are insufficient, various localities have carried forward the spirit of cooperation and carried out the transfer and exchange of improved varieties between teams, communes, and counties.

According to the principle of "self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, and self-use," Hebei has generally established improved variety breeding bases this year. Jilin's rural areas have established a total of 410 improved variety breeding farms, with more than 210,000 hectares of seed fields, basically achieving that every commune has a farm and every team has a base. This provides favorable conditions for seed selection and retention.

To properly preserve seeds, communes and production teams in various localities have implemented systems such as special storage in special warehouses, management by special personnel, and regular inspections.

Liaodong Peninsula Rejoices in Apple Harvest
This year, the people's communes in the apple-producing areas of Liaoning, under the leadership of the Party, overcame serious natural disasters such as wind, frost, disease, and insects, and achieved a relatively good harvest. The proportion of first- and second-grade apples has increased significantly compared to last year. At present, the apple harvesting work in the main producing areas such as Gaiping and Fuxian has basically ended.

Shantou Prefecture Expands Planting of Potato Under Rice
Shantou Prefecture, Guangdong Province, is actively promoting the experience of local farmers in planting potatoes under rice. At present, 300,000 mu of potatoes have been planted under rice in the entire prefecture, more than double the area of last year.

Planting potatoes under rice has many benefits. Potatoes planted under rice have more than one month longer growing period than winter potatoes planted after harvesting late rice. By the time of frost in December and January of the following year, they have already formed tubers. They are resistant to cold and are not easily frozen to death, so the yield is generally more than double that of potatoes planted after autumn.

    要闻快报
    江苏力争晚茬不晚种
    江苏省截至二十六日统计，已种晚茬麦六百多万亩，一般都做到施足基肥，深耕细耙，合理密植。目前，各地都在继续抢种，力争晚茬不晚种，晚茬赶早茬，适时地完成秋种计划，夺取秋种全胜。
    河南推广粮菜间作麦豆混作
    河南各地在秋种中积极推广“粮菜间作”和“麦豆混作”。到二十一日统计，全省已经播种的越冬粮食作物中，已有百分之三十四以上实行了间作、混作。
    麦田实行间作、混作，需要更多的豆种、菜种和肥料。为了满足这个需要，各地都在积极地积肥、造肥，互换和采购种子。
    黑龙江大秋作物收割结束
    黑龙江省大秋作物收割已经结束，各地正在突击拉地、打场和进行秋耕。今年全省秋收比以往任何一年都快都好。在收割工作进入扫尾阶段时，各地还组织了一百三十多万人下地突击拣粮，现在已拣回大批粮食，并收回各种蔬菜和甜菜的叶子、缨子七万一千多吨。
    青海开始收割水稻
    青海省种植的水稻已经开始收割。从各地收割和脱粒的情况看，今年水稻一般收成良好。今年水稻生产的情况说明水稻在青海高原很有发展前途。
    今年青海省种植水稻的地区和面积都比往年扩大。为了帮助青海农民较快地掌握水稻种植技术，同青海条件类似的黑龙江省，曾派了十位农民技术员进行技术指导。
    吉林河北大选良种
    吉林、河北在秋收中大选良种。部分受灾地区良种不足，各地发扬了协作精神，在队与队、社与社、县与县之间进行了良种调剂、串换。
    根据“自繁、自选、自留、自用”的方针，河北今年普遍建立了良种繁育基地，吉林农村共建立良种繁殖场四百一十处，种子田二十一万多公顷，基本上实现了社社有场，队队有基地。这为选种留种提供了有利条件。
    为了妥善保存种子，各地公社和生产队实行了专库专放、专人保管、定期检查等制度。
    辽东半岛喜收苹果
    今年辽宁苹果产区的人民公社，在党的领导下，战胜了风、冻、病、虫等严重自然灾害，夺得了较好的收成。一、二级苹果的比例比去年显著提高。现在，盖平、复县等主要产区苹果采收工作已基本结束。
    汕头专区扩种稻底薯
    广东省汕头专区积极推广当地农民种植稻底薯的经验。现在，全区已种稻底薯三十万亩，比去年扩大一倍多。
    种植稻底薯有很多好处。稻底薯比收晚稻后才种的冬薯多了一个多月的生长期，到当年十二月和次年一月间下霜的时节，它已经结了薯块，它耐寒力强，不易冻死，因此产量一般要比秋后种植的高一倍以上。
