This newspaper, Lanzhou, 9th October, reports: Pingluo Commune in Wudu County, Gansu Province, has conscientiously summarised its experience in careful harvesting and threshing over the years, dividing this year's large-scale autumn harvest process into eight links, interlocking them and implementing them in detail. This not only plugged various loopholes of scattering and waste, achieving "ten percent crop, ten percent harvest," but also ensured accurate yield assessment and grain allocation in one go.

This year, Pingluo People's Commune planted more than 24,000 mu of various autumn crops, an increase of 35.4% compared with last year. In order to harvest the autumn grain well, the Commune Party Committee organized commune members to conscientiously summarise the experience of careful harvesting and threshing in previous years and in this year's summer harvest after the summer harvest was over. It also fully discussed the operating procedures of each process in the autumn harvest. According to the opinions of the masses, the entire autumn harvest process was summarized into eight interlinked characters: "Harvest, Transport, Thresh, Winnow, Weigh, Store, Manage, Use." Based on the experience and lessons learned that grain scattering often occurred in the four processes of "Harvest, Transport, Thresh, Winnow," and that loopholes could occur if there were any oversights in "Weigh, Store, Manage, Use," the manpower arranged on the autumn harvest front was divided into two sets of organizations, front and rear, according to the different procedures of the first four and last four. The front four processes of "Harvest, Transport, Thresh, Winnow" were arranged and registered block by block according to the maturity of various crops. Based on the strengths and weaknesses of each individual, harvesting, transporting, threshing, and winnowing were combined into a continuous operation of specialized teams, implementing individual responsibility until the end. Adhering to the spirit of "harvesting ten when eight are ripe," harvesting was done first when ripe, and harvested as it ripened. Light harvesting, light placing, light sorting, and light bundling were achieved; harvesting and transporting were done simultaneously, ensuring that crops were not harvested out of season and transported overnight; threshing, winnowing, and drying, as well as storing in the warehouse, were done simultaneously with transportation. The entire process ensured that no ears of grain were left on the stalks, no grains were left on the ears, and the stalks were clean, the ground was clean, the roads were clean, the ears were clean, and the fields were clean. The four processes of "Weigh, Store, Manage, Use" were undertaken by fair and capable Party members and activists, forming a warehousing and storage team responsible for weighing, selling, storing, and managing. Following the principle of overall planning and comprehensive arrangement, the rations, public grain purchases, seeds, and feed for commune members were arranged at one time. The entire process promoted "six unified and six specialized," that is, on the basis of implementing the "three guarantees and one reward," the accounting unit unified harvesting, unified threshing and drying, unified weighing, unified storage, unified processing, and unified use, as well as specialized grain storage, specialized personnel accounts, and specialized management and use, so that each link was connected, ensuring that nothing was lost in the field and nothing was damaged in the warehouse.

In order to ensure that the "Harvest, Transport, Thresh, Winnow, Weigh, Store, Manage, Use" were interlinked, and that each character was thoroughly grasped and each item was implemented, cadres at all levels went deep into production teams, fields, threshing grounds, warehouses, and discussed with the masses, discovering and solving problems, reforming unreasonable production procedures, and saving a large amount of labor. For example, grain warehouses were selected in places closer to processing plants, and public grain purchase warehouses were selected along transportation lines. At the same time, the masses were mobilized to vigorously reform tools, creating and repairing 42 kinds of autumn harvesting tools, forming a dragon from harvesting to warehousing.

Due to the comprehensive implementation of the eight-character chain, the autumn harvest work of the whole commune was both fast and good. As of the beginning of October, more than 11,500 mu of various autumn crops had been harvested, which was ten to fifteen days faster than the same period last year. Under the slogan of the Commune Party Committee requiring each person to increase grain production by 30 jin, every team achieved clean fields, clean roads, clean threshing grounds, and clean grass, "ten percent crop, ten percent harvest."

This newspaper, Taiyuan, 9th October, reports: In order to ensure a greater and better autumn grain harvest, the Dongguanzhuang Management Area of Chengguan People's Commune in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, actively promoted the advanced method of "Harvest, Bundle, Load, Transport, Stack, Thresh, Winnow, Store, Protect, Reward" - a ten-character "one-dragon" approach for careful harvesting and threshing, creating a new atmosphere of clean ground, clean stalks, and clean roads in autumn harvesting. This year, the average harvest per mu of grain in this management area is five to ten jin more than in previous years. Among the more than 190 mu of grain crops that have been harvested and threshed in the whole area, a total of more than 1,900 jin of grain have been threshed more through careful harvesting and threshing.

The specific practices of the "Ten-Character Method" are:

"Harvest": Detailed classification and queuing were carried out according to the different varieties and maturity times of the crops, and harvesting was carried out in stages. In each harvesting period, millet, corn, mung beans, sorghum, etc., which are easy to thresh, were harvested first, followed by corn; high mountains and slopes were harvested first, followed by plains and shady areas; millet, mung beans, and corn were harvested in the morning, and corn was harvested in the noon and afternoon, so that a harvest was made as each plot ripened.

"Bundle": Crops such as millet, mung beans, and corn, which are easy to thresh and lose ears, were bundled on the same day as they were harvested. When bundling, the ears were aligned with each other, the ends did not expose the ears, and the bundles were tied tightly.

"Load": Care was taken to handle the loading lightly, and mats and cloth curtains were laid in the carriages of 150 large carts and 20 small flat carts to prevent grain leakage. Each commune member carrying loads prepared two bundles of cloth, and the bundles of cloth were wrapped under the bundles to avoid ears of grain falling to the ground.

"Transport": All 24 major roads in the entire management area were generally repaired, ensuring that all roads were clear to prevent transportation accidents and damage to crops. For crops such as millet, corn, and sorghum, which are easy to thresh, they were transported in the early morning and evening when they were damp, and people carried appropriate amounts to reduce rubbing and threshing.

"Stack": The stacks of crops such as mung beans, millet, and corn were stacked small and solid. The stacks were piled in high, sunny places, and the tops were covered with straw to prevent rain damage and mildew.

"Thresh": All 24 threshing grounds were watered carefully beforehand and rolled heavily with stone rollers to make them flat and solid. When rolling the fields, beans and corn were rolled five to seven times, and turned over and copied finely.

"Winnow": In the winnowing process, the method of "winnowing small, winnowing light, and winnowing with the wind" was implemented. When sweeping the fields, brooms were used for areas with more grains, and hands were used for areas with fewer grains, so that no grain was lost.

"Store": In order to ensure that every grain of grain that has been acquired is returned to the barn, all grain bags were checked and repaired. All warehouses were repaired once.

"Protect": The entire management area organized autumn protection teams with militiamen as the backbone, forming eight groups and 24 subgroups. A responsibility system was established, and a contract system was implemented to protect the autumn grain in the fields and those that have been threshed and stored in the warehouse. The keepers and commune members generally formulated autumn protection covenants.

"Reward": During the autumn harvest period, the management area conducted inspections and comparisons every seven days, the production team conducted comparisons every three days, and the work group checked every morning and evening and compared every day. A general evaluation was made after the autumn harvest. Cash payment methods and reward methods were established for children who picked up autumn grain and commune members who picked up autumn grain on the way.

    收运打扬秤藏管用　八字连环环环扣紧
    平洛公社收获秋粮又细又快
    城关公社东管庄管理区推行“十字一条龙”的细收细打先进方法
    本报兰州9日电　甘肃武都县平洛公社认真总结历年细收细打的经验，把今年大面积的秋收过程分为八个环节，使之环环扣紧，条条落实，不仅堵塞了各种抛撒浪费漏洞，做到“十成庄稼十成收”，同时使产量一次见底，粮食一次安排。
    平洛人民公社今年种植各种秋田二万四千多亩，比去年扩大了35.4％。公社党委为了把秋粮收好，在夏收结束后就组织社员认真总结了历年来和今年夏收中细收细打的经验，充分讨论了秋收工作中各道工序的操作规程。根据群众意见，把整个秋收过程归纳为“收、运、打、扬、秤、藏、管、用”八字连环。根据历年抛撒粮食往往发生在“收、运、打、扬”四道工序上，而“秤、藏、管、用”稍有疏忽也会发生漏洞等经验教训，按前四道和后四道工序的不同，把安排在秋收战线上的一套人马，分为前方后方两套组织，前方“收、运、打、扬”四道工序，根据各种作物成熟先后，逐块排队登记，按各人特长，体力强弱，组成收割、拉运、打碾、扬晒四道连作专业组，实行人活对号包干到底，本着“黄八收十”的精神，先熟先割，随黄随收，做到了轻割、轻放、轻理、轻捆；边割边运，收不过时、运不过夜；随运随打随扬晒、随入库。整个工序都做到秸不漏穗，穗不漏粮，秸净、地净、路净、穗净、场净。“秤、藏、管、用”四道工序，由公道能干的党团员积极分子，组成入库储用队，负责过秤、交售、储藏、管理。按照统筹兼顾、全面安排的原则，一次安排社员口粮、公购粮、籽种和饲料。整个过程推行了“六统六专”：即在执行“三包一奖”的基础上，由核算单位统一收割、统一打晒、统一过秤、统一保管、统一加工、统一使用和专粮专库、专人专账、专管专用，使各个环节衔接，做到了场上不丢，仓内不坏。
    为了使“收、运、打、扬、秤、藏、管、用”连环配套，字字抓透、条条落实，各级干部深入到生产队、田头、场头、仓库和群众一起商量，发现问题解决问题，改革不合理的生产程序，节省出大批劳力。如把口粮仓库选择在距离加工厂较近的地方，公购粮仓库选择在交通沿线。同时发动群众大力改革工具，创制检修秋收工具四十二种，从收到入库工具配成龙。
    由于全面推行了八字连环，全社秋收工作既快又好。到10月初，已收回各种秋作物一万一千五百多亩，比去年同期加快十天到半月左右。在公社党委要求每人增收三十斤粮的口号下，队队都达到田里净、路上净、场上净、草上净，“十成庄稼十成收”。
    本报太原9日电　山西省闻喜县城关人民公社东管庄管理区为了保证秋粮多收、收好，积极推行了“收、捆、装、运、堆、打、扬、藏、护、奖”十字一条龙的细收细打先进方法，使秋收工作出现了地净、株净、路净的新气象。今年，这个管理区每亩粮食的收获量平均比往年要多收五至十斤，全区目前已收割登场的一百九十多亩粮食作物中，通过细收细打共多打粮食一千九百多斤。
    “十字法”的具体做法是：
    “收”：根据作物不同品种、成熟时间进行了细致的分类排队，实行了分期收割。在每期收割中，先收割容易脱粒的黍子、谷子、绿豆、高粱等，后收玉米；先收高山、坡岭地，后收平川地、背阴地；早上收黍子、绿豆、谷子，中午与下午收玉米，作到了熟一块割一块。
    “捆”：黍子、绿豆、谷子等易脱粒掉穗的作物，做到当天收割当天捆。捆时穗对穗，两头不露穗，捆得牢。
    “装”：装车时轻拿轻放，并在一百五十辆大车和二十辆小平车的车厢里铺上席子和布帘子，不让漏粒掉颗。担挑的社员每人准备两个包袱皮，担时把包袱皮包在捆子下边，避免了穗粒落地。
    “运”：全管理区二十四条大路普遍进行了整修，达到了条条道路畅通，防止运输发生事故和损坏庄稼。对于黍子、谷子、高粱等易脱粒的庄稼，早晚趁潮湿运，人背人担适量，减少揉搓脱粒。
    “堆”：绿豆、黍子、谷子等作物的垛子堆得小，堆得实，垛子堆在地势高、向阳的地方，堆顶盖上了秸秆，防止天雨损坏和发生霉烂。
    “打”：二十四个打谷场都事先用水细泼，用石碾重碾，作到平展光实。碾场时，豆子、谷子都碾到五至七遍，细翻细誊。
    “扬”：在扬场当中，实行了“扬小、扬轻、扬顺风”的办法，扫场时粒多用扫帚扫，粒少用手捻，作到了一粒不丢。
    “藏”：为了使已经到手的粮食粒粒归仓，对所有装粮食的口袋，都作了检查、修补。对所有仓库都进行一次整修。
    “护”：全管理区以民兵为骨干组织了护秋队伍，分别组成八个小组和二十四个分组。划分责任制，实行包干制，保护地里的和已经上场、入库的秋粮。饲养员和社员普遍制订了护秋公约。
    “奖”：收秋期间，管理区七天进行一次检查评比，生产队里三天进行一次评比，作业组晌晌查，天天比，秋后总评。对拾秋的儿童和捎带拾秋的社员都订了现款付酬办法和奖励办法。
