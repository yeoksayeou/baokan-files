Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th Dispatch: The Japanese government formally decided yesterday to hold a general election on November 20th. Various political parties are currently stepping up their election campaigns.
    It is reported that as of the 23rd, Japanese political parties and independents had nominated a total of 946 candidates to compete for the 467 seats in the House of Representatives.

    The Japanese Communist Party has nominated 118 candidates nationwide, one in each electoral district, a significant increase compared to the past. Before the dissolution of the Diet, the JCP had already published its election program, putting forward the demands for independence, freedom, democracy, and peace, and calling on the people to fight for the smashing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, the overthrow of the Ikeda government, and the establishment of a democratic united government against the "Security Treaty." The Japanese Communist Party has also issued appeals to various trade unions and the people of the whole country, striving for the victory of the Japanese Communist Party and democratic forces in the general election. These appeals issued by the JCP for the interests of the broad masses of the people have gained the support of an increasing number of people.

    The Socialist Party has nominated 187 candidates. It advocates a policy of neutrality in its election platform. It is currently attacking the Ikeda government and the ruling party over the assassination of Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma by U.S.-Japan reactionaries, and is preparing to fight the ruling party on issues such as the war danger of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," rising prices, and the government's predatory agricultural policies. The Socialist Party is striving to prevent the Japanese reactionaries from manipulating the Diet to approve amendments to the Japanese Peace Constitution, requiring more than one-third of the seats.

    The Liberal Democratic Party and the Ikeda government, taking advantage of their ruling position, are stepping up their fascist suppression of democratic forces, and instructing the police to restrict and interfere with the election activities of progressive candidates. They are using the bourgeois propaganda machine to publicize the reactionary "new policies" of the Ikeda Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party, and are preparing to use the deceptive plan of so-called "doubling the national income" as a focus to deceive voters. To support the Liberal Democratic Party's election campaign, monopoly capitalists have provided more campaign funds to the Liberal Democratic Party than in the last general election for various improper activities. According to the "Asahi Shimbun," monopoly capitalists provided 800 million yen to the Liberal Democratic Party through the "Economic Reconstruction Roundtable Conference"; in addition, "more than 2 billion yen of funds from the financial and business circles flowed into the Liberal Democratic Party."

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch: Under the long-term and heroic struggle of the Japanese people, the Ikeda government issued a statement on the evening of the 24th, announcing the dissolution of the House of Representatives of the Diet in order to hold a general election on November 20th.

    The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement last night on the dissolution of the Diet and the general election, saying that the central issue of the election must be the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" issue. The Socialist Party's statement said that the people's forces, who unyieldingly opposed the conclusion of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," forced the ruling party and the government to dissolve the Diet.

    The statement also pointed out: Although the Ikeda Cabinet put on a "low profile," its ugly and anti-people essence has been exposed; the "Security Treaty" has once again become the focus of people's attention.

    The statement condemned the Ikeda Cabinet's economic policies. The statement said, "Now the entire people can see very clearly that Ikeda's optimistic plan to double income is nothing more than a foolish attempt to win people's hearts."

    The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan also issued a statement last night after the dissolution of the Diet, criticizing the Ikeda Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party. In its statement, "Sohyo" believed that Prime Minister Ikeda was responsible for the Diet's hasty passage of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

    In talking about Ikeda's current policies, the statement said that the Ikeda government serves big capital at the expense of the people's lives. The statement criticized the Ikeda Cabinet's policies for causing rising prices.

    "Sohyo" announced that it would vigorously launch an election campaign to fight for the maintenance of peace, democracy, and the people's lives.

    日本各政党展开竞选活动
    日共号召粉碎日美条约打倒池田内阁
    社会党抨击池田政府反动政策主张日本中立
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本政府昨天正式决定在11月20日举行大选。各政党目前正在加紧展开竞选活动。
    据报道，到23日为止，日本各政党和无党派人士已经提出了共计九百四十六名候选人，来竞选众议院的四百六十七个议席。
      日本共产党在全国提出了一百一十八名候选人，每个选区一名，候选人数比过去大大增加。日共在国会解散前已经发表了竞选纲领，提出了争取独立、自由、民主、和平的主张，并号召人民为粉碎日美军事同盟条约、打倒池田政府，建立反对“安全条约”的民主联合政府而斗争。日本共产党并且向各工会和全国人民发出呼吁，争取日本共产党和民主力量在大选中获得胜利。日共为广大人民利益而发出的这些呼吁，得到了日益增多的人的支持。
    社会党已经提出了一百八十七名候选人。它在竞选纲领中主张实行中立政策。目前它正在就美日反动派杀害社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎的事件，抨击池田政府和执政党，并且准备就新日美“安全条约”的战争危险，物价上涨、政府的掠夺性农业政策等问题，对执政党进行斗争。社会党正在争取为阻止日本反动派操纵国会批准修改日本和平宪法所需要的三分之一以上的议席。
    自由民主党和池田政府利用它们的执政地位，正在加紧对民主力量实行法西斯镇压，并且指令警察限制和干涉进步候选人的竞选活动。它们通过资产阶级的宣传机器，大肆宣传池田内阁和自由民主党的反动的“新政策”，并且准备以所谓“使国民收入增加一倍”的欺骗性计划为重点来骗取选票。垄断资本家为了支持自由民主党竞选，比上次大选时提供了更多的竞选资金给自由民主党，用来进行各种不正当的活动。据“朝日新闻”报道，垄断资本家通过“经济再建恳谈会”向自由民主党提供了八亿日元；另外“金融实业界有二十多亿日元的资金流进自由民主党”。
    据新华社25日讯　东京消息：在日本人民长期英勇斗争下，池田政府24日晚间发表声明，宣布解散国会众议院，以便在11月20日举行大选。
    日本社会党昨天晚间就国会解散和大选问题发表声明说，大选的中心问题必须是日美“安全条约”问题。社会党的声明说，不屈不挠地反对缔结日美“安全条约”的人民力量迫使执政党和政府解散了国会。
    声明并且指出：尽管池田内阁装出了“低姿态”，但是它的丑恶的和反人民的本质已经暴露；“安全条约”已经再次成为人民注意的中心问题。
    声明谴责了池田内阁的经济政策。声明说，“现在全体人民看得很清楚，池田的乐观的使收入增加一倍的计划不外是企图笼络人心的愚蠢做法罢了。”
    日本工会总评议会昨天晚上在国会解散以后也发表声明，抨击池田内阁和自由民主党。“总评”在声明中认为，池田首相对国会匆匆通过日美“安全条约”负有责任。
    声明在谈到池田目前的政策时说，池田政府为大资本服务，而牺牲人民的生活。声明抨击池田内阁的政策引起物价上涨。
    “总评”宣布，它将大力展开竞选运动，为维护和平、民主和人民的生活而斗争。
