Xinhua News Agency, 5th - Vice Premier of the State Council, Li Xiannian, held a banquet this evening to warmly welcome the Vice Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Li Jooyeon. Members of the Economic Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea: Vice Minister of Trade, Kim Choi-sun, Ambassador to China, Li Yong-ho, and accompanying members of the delegation were all invited to attend the banquet.

The banquet was held in the Xinjiang Hall of the Great Hall of the People.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian, in his speech, extended a warm welcome on behalf of the government of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese people to the distinguished Korean guests. He said: China and Korea are friendly neighbors as closely related as lips and teeth, close brothers in the socialist family, and intimate comrades-in-arms. For eleven years, our two peoples have always stood closely together, fought side by side, supported each other, and advanced together, whether in the struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and in defense of world peace, or in socialist construction. The friendship between our two countries is a lofty friendship built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, a friendship tempered by severe tests of sharing life and death, and cemented with blood. This friendship is evergreen and unbreakable.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said: Under the wise leadership of Comrade Kim Il-sung and the Korean Workers' Party, the diligent and brave Korean people, standing at the eastern outpost of the socialist camp, resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist policies of war and aggression, safeguard peace in Asia and the world, and have carried out socialist revolution and socialist construction effectively. Now, after completing the First Five-Year Plan two and a half years ahead of schedule, the Korean people are preparing to welcome the magnificent Seven-Year Plan. They have extensively launched a comprehensive technological innovation movement, and continue to advance towards greater victories with the spirit of Chollima. The Korean Workers' Party, the government of the Republic, and the people have made unremitting efforts for the unification of their homeland. The Chinese people are elated and inspired by every victory achieved by the Korean people, and sincerely wish the Korean people new and greater victories in the struggle to build socialism and strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said: Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant illumination of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and People’s Communes, China's socialist construction continues to overcome various difficulties, achieve a comprehensive and sustained Great Leap Forward, and rapidly change the face of "poverty and blankness." The high-speed development of socialist construction in China and Korea and the tremendous upsurge of the economies of other socialist countries have greatly strengthened the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and powerfully inspired and continue to inspire the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and for world peace and human progress.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian concluded by saying that the people of China and Korea are now struggling to accelerate socialist construction. We believe that the visit to our country by the Korean government economic delegation headed by Vice Premier Li Jooyeon will surely promote the further development of the brotherly relations of mutual assistance and cooperation between the Chinese and Korean peoples. The Chinese people will always work with the Korean people to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp, strengthen economic cooperation between China and Korea, and make greater efforts to promote the common cause of the continuous upsurge of socialist economic construction on both sides!

Vice Premier Li Jooyeon then spoke. He said: Our delegation has visited with great joy and delight the tremendous achievements made by the Chinese people in the past eleven years in welcoming the eleventh anniversary of the National Day.

Vice Premier Li Jooyeon said: Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the fraternal Chinese people are achieving brilliant achievements in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction. Now, the great Chinese people, firmly united around the Communist Party of China and the government of the People's Republic of China, are launching a nationwide labor struggle to further promote the country's socialist construction and to effectively complete the tasks of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. Today, the People's Republic of China is transforming into a socialist power with modern industry and rural economy as well as advanced science and culture. These achievements have made great contributions to strengthening the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and maintaining and consolidating the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

Vice Premier Li Jooyeon said: Our Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, are launching a vigorous labor struggle for socialist construction, and are achieving great achievements in various sectors of the people's economy. The great assistance from socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and the noble material and spiritual assistance from the fraternal Chinese people are imbued in all these achievements we have made. I would like to take this opportunity to once again express my deep gratitude for the proletarian internationalist assistance of the fraternal Chinese people.

Vice Premier Li Jooyeon said: The friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China has been further consolidated and developed through the struggle against the common enemy—U.S. imperialism—and the close cooperation in socialist construction. As members of the strong socialist camp family headed by the Soviet Union, the traditional friendship between our Korean and Chinese peoples will, through historical practice, be consolidated and developed into an invincible force.

The speeches of Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Premier Li Jooyeon were warmly welcomed.

During the banquet, the hosts and guests repeatedly raised their glasses, wishing for the eternal brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and good health to Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Kim Il-sung, and other leaders of the two countries.

Present at the banquet were Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade, Jiang Guangnai, Minister of Textile Industry, Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Song Yangchu, Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission, Lei Renmin, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, Li Su, Vice Minister of Chemical Industry, Yang Shoushan, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, Liu Ding, Vice Minister of the Third Ministry of Machine Building, Rong Yiren, Vice Minister of Textile Industry, Shen Guang, Vice Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, Jia Tingsan, Vice Mayor of Beijing, Lao She and Wei Chuantong, Vice Presidents of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, and heads of other departments.
