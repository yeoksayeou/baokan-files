Xinhua News Agency, 29th. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Australia, congratulating the Communist Party of Australia on its 40th anniversary. October 30 is the 40th anniversary of the founding of the CPA. The full text of the CPC Central Committee's congratulatory telegram is as follows:

Dear Comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Australia,

On the occasion the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of Australia, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on behalf of all members of our Party and the people of the whole country, extends warm, fraternal congratulations to the Communist Party of Australia and the Australian working class.

For the past forty years, the Communist Party of Australia, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, has unremittingly struggled for the immediate interests and complete liberation of the Australian working class and working people, and has made great contributions to the common cause of striving for world peace, democracy and socialism. Your party is worthy of being the advanced detachment of the Australian working class.

The Communist Party of Australia and the Australian people have always been concerned about and supported the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and socialist construction, which the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are very grateful for. We firmly believe that the friendship between our two parties and the peoples of our two countries will be further developed.

The development of the current international situation is very favorable to us. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, the enemy is rotting day by day, while we are getting better day by day. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger, the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing, the revolutionary struggles of the people in capitalist countries are rising, and the forces of the people of all countries in the world to defend peace are also strengthened; while the imperialist camp headed by the United States shows disintegration, and the life of imperialism is not long. Faced with this situation, U.S. imperialism has repeatedly played its tricks of fake peace and real war in recent years, and has used modern revisionists to attack Marxism-Leninism and undermine the unity of the international communist movement in every possible way. However, as long as we communists continue to hold high the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism, constantly educate the masses, heighten our vigilance, strengthen unity, form a united front against U.S.-led imperialism and its lackeys, persist in the struggle against imperialism, and strengthen the thorough exposure of modern revisionism, then we will surely be able to shatter the imperialist policies of aggression and war, defend world peace, and promote the revolutionary cause of the people of the world to develop more vigorously.

We firmly believe that the Communist Party of Australia, which has experienced forty years of struggle, training and testing, will continue to hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, unite the Australian working class and working people, achieve greater success in the struggle against imperialism and bourgeois reactionaries, and make greater contributions to the cause of striving for world peace, democracy and socialism.

    中共中央致电澳大利亚共产党中央
    祝贺澳大利亚共产党成立四十周年
    新华社29日讯　中国共产党中央委员会致电澳大利亚共产党中央委员会，祝贺澳大利亚共产党成立四十周年。10月30日是澳共成立四十周年纪念日。中共中央贺电全文如下：澳大利亚共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    值此澳大利亚共产党成立四十周年之际，中国共产党中央委员会谨代表我党全体党员和全国人民，向澳大利亚共产党和澳大利亚工人阶级致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    四十年来，澳大利亚共产党高举着马克思列宁主义的旗帜，坚持不懈地为澳大利亚工人阶级和劳动人民的切身利益和彻底解放而奋斗，并且对争取世界和平、民主和社会主义的共同事业作出了巨大贡献。你们的党不愧为澳大利亚工人阶级的先进部队。
    澳大利亚共产党和澳大利亚人民一向关心和支持中国人民的革命斗争和社会主义建设事业，中国共产党和中国人民非常感谢。我们深信，我们两党和两国人民之间的友谊将会得到进一步的发展。
    当前国际形势的发展对我们非常有利，正如毛泽东同志所说的，敌人在一天天烂下去，我们在一天天好起来。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量日益强盛，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主运动蓬蓬勃勃地发展，资本主义国家人民的革命斗争日趋高涨，世界各国人民的保卫和平的力量也更加增强；而以美国为首的帝国主义阵营则表现出分崩离析，帝国主义的寿命已经不长了。面对着这种局势，美帝国主义近年来一再玩弄其假和平真备战的诡计，并利用现代修正主义分子千方百计地攻击马克思列宁主义和破坏国际共产主义运动的团结。但是，只要我们共产党人继续高高地举起马克思列宁主义的革命旗帜，不断教育群众，提高警惕，加强团结，结成一个反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的统一战线，坚持进行反对帝国主义的斗争，加强对现代修正主义的彻底揭露，那么，我们就一定能够粉碎帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫住世界和平，并且促进世界人民的革命事业更加蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。
    我们深信，经历了四十年斗争锻炼和考验的澳大利亚共产党，今后必将继续高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，团结澳大利亚的工人阶级和劳动人民，在反对帝国主义和资产阶级反动派的斗争中取得更大的成就，并且对争取世界和平、民主和社会主义的事业作出更大的贡献。
    中国共产党中央委员会
