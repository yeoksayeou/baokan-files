Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 27th October: Fan Guofen, a twenty-year-old Communist Party member and junior middle school student from Wanglitang Team, Zhuhangtang Brigade, Xiangtang Commune, Beiliu County, Guangxi, loves agricultural labor. She steps forward whenever difficulties arise in her work and has contributed to changing the face of her hometown. She has been rewarded more than ten times by the Beiliu County Party Committee, the Xiangtang Commune Party Committee, and the brigade Party branch.

After Fan Guofen returned home from school in the spring of 1959, she actively participated in agricultural labor, leaving early and returning late every day. However, some people at the time called her "foolish." These cold words made Fan Guofen unable to understand: "Participating in agricultural production in the countryside is glorious! Why don't others understand me, and my parents don't understand me? Am I wrong?" She went to the brigade Party branch secretary, who told her, "You are not wrong. An educated youth should actively participate in production and dedicate their knowledge and youth to the construction of rural communes." The branch secretary's words gave her great strength. She straightened her back and said, "Right, I must work hard and contribute all my knowledge and youth."

This spring, the Wanglitang production team leader and deputy leader took eighteen male commune members to the reservoir construction site, leaving most of the twenty-eight remaining laborers as women. Fan Guofen was the scorekeeper, and the branch secretary asked her to act as the team leader, leading this "women's army" to plant and manage all 125 mu of the team's fields. After accepting the task, Fan Guofen encountered many difficulties. More than one hundred mu of fields needed plowing, harrowing, sowing, fertilizer application, and rice transplanting, but they only had twenty-odd people, and they didn't know how to do some of these farm tasks at all. Fan Guofen was not intimidated by these difficulties. She encouraged the women, saying, "The male commune members are not at home, but we must also make a great leap forward. We must hold up the sky if it collapses!" She contacted Li Huizhen, Chen Qifang, Wu Qingfang, and other activists, relying on them to mobilize other women and first unite everyone closely together. Then, she and three activists took the lead in learning to plow the fields. At first, the oxen would not listen to them. After a few days of practice, the oxen obeyed, and their plowing skills caught up with those of a male commune member. Later, Fan Guofen and several women learned how to soak and sow seeds from the old farmer Fan Shangzhong. During rice transplanting, the weather was very cold, but they overcame the severe cold with enthusiasm. In half a month, they completed the spring transplanting task on time, ensuring increased production even though one-third of the early rice fields in the team suffered from drought. During this period, in addition to acting as the team leader, Fan Guofen also served as the scorekeeper and canteen manager. She arranged the work in an orderly manner: she would hand over the rice, vegetables, oil, and salt needed for the three meals of the day to the cook early in the morning; during the day, she would lead the commune members to work in the fields, evaluating work and keeping scores in the fields; after meetings in the evening to arrange work, she would settle the food accounts and work point accounts. She often stayed busy until late at night before going to bed.

More than half of the Wanglitang team's paddy fields are low-yielding mountain fields. Transforming these low-yielding fields into high-yielding fields became the key to striving for increased grain production. Not far from the village was a mountain area with more than six mu of low-yielding fields. Before liberation, the landlord had killed chickens and ducks to worship six temples, praying to the gods and Buddhas to bless these fields with high yields. In the end, it was not only ineffective, but the area was given the name "Six Temples Area." When the team cadres proposed to transform the low-yielding mountain fields, some people poured cold water, saying, "Even the gods and Buddhas cannot change the low-yielding fields!" Fan Guofen contacted seven women with advanced ideas, held a meeting, and decided to plant high-yielding experimental fields for women in the "Six Temples Area" to break people's superstitious ideas with practical actions. Based on the characteristics of these low-yielding fields, they applied sufficient high-quality base fertilizer during transplanting, managed the seedlings scientifically after planting, and applied more fertilizer. Through their careful management, the "Six Temples Area" changed the old appearance of stalks no more than a foot high, thin seedlings, and yellow leaves, and a new scene of long stalks and thick stems appeared. The changes in the "Six Temples Area" inspired the commune members to work even harder, and the team launched a comprehensive upsurge in the transformation of low-yielding mountain fields.

    做能文能武的农业生产尖兵
    广西香塘公社知识青年樊国芬立志改变家乡面貌
    据新华社南宁27日电　广西北流县香塘公社竹杭塘大队旺梨塘小队二十岁的共产党员、初中学生樊国芬，热爱农业劳动，在劳动中见困难就上，为改变家乡面貌做出了贡献，曾十多次受到中共北流县委、香塘公社党委和大队党支部的奖励。
    樊国芬在1959年春天休学回家后，就天天早出晚归，积极参加农业劳动。但是，当时有些人却说她“傻”。这些冷言冷语，使樊国芬怎么也想不通：“在农村参加农业生产是光荣的呀！为什么别人不了解我，父母也不了解我？难道是我错了？”她去找大队党支部书记，支部书记告诉她：“你没有错，一个知识青年，应该积极参加生产，把自己的知识和青春献给农村公社的建设事业。”支部书记的话给了她很大的力量，她把腰挺了挺说：“对，要好好干下去，把全部知识和青春贡献出来。”
    今年春季，旺梨塘生产队正副队长带着十八个男社员到水库工地去了，剩下的二十八个劳动力绝大部分是妇女。樊国芬是记分员，支部书记要她代理队长领导这支“娘子军”，把全队一百二十五亩田种好、管好。樊国芬接受任务后，碰到很多困难。一百多亩田，要犁耙、播种、送肥，又要插秧，但她们只有二十几个人，而且这些农活中有的她们根本不会。樊国芬没有被这些困难吓倒，她鼓励妇女们说：“男社员不在家，我们也要大跃进，天崩也要顶住它！”她串连了李惠珍、陈启芳、吴庆芳等几个积极分子，依靠她们发动其他妇女，首先把大家紧密团结在一起。接着，她和三个积极分子带头学犁田。开始，牛不听她们使唤，经过几天驾驭以后，牛听话了，她们犁耙的熟练程度也赶上了一个男社员的水平。以后，樊国芬又和几个妇女向老农樊尚忠学会了浸种、播种。插秧时，天气很冷，她们以热情战胜了严寒，在半个月中按时完成了春插任务，在全队早造田有三分之一受旱的情况下，仍然保证了增产。在这期间，樊国芬除代理队长外，还担任记分员和食堂管理员工作。她把工作安排得井井有条：每天三餐饭要用的米、菜、油、盐，一早就点交给炊事员；白天领导社员去田间劳动，在田头评工记分；晚上开会安排工作后，就结算伙食账和工分账。她经常忙到深夜才睡觉。
    旺梨塘小队的水田有半数以上是山冲低产田，把这些低产田改造成高产田，就成为争取粮食增产的关键。离村不远有一个山冲，那里有六亩多低产田，解放前田主曾杀鸡宰鸭拜了六个庵堂，祈求神佛保佑这几亩田高产，结果不但一点效力也没有，反落个“六庵堂冲”的名字。当队干部提出要改造山冲低产田时，就有人泼冷水说：“神佛都不能改变低产田！”樊国芬串连了七个思想先进的妇女，开了一个会，决定在“六庵堂冲”种妇女高产试验田，以实际行动打破人们的迷信思想。她们根据这几亩低产田的特点，在插秧时下足优质基肥，种下后用科学方法管理禾苗，同时多追施肥料。经过她们精心管理，“六庵堂冲”改变了历来禾高不过尺、苗瘦叶黄的旧貌，出现了秆长茎粗的新景象。“六庵堂冲”的变化，鼓舞了社员们的更大干劲，全队掀起了全面改造山冲低产田的热潮。
