Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 6th - According to Vientiane Radio today: Lao Prime Minister Prince Phouma said at a mass rally in Vientiane on the 4th that the current situation in Laos is an internal matter of the Lao people and should be resolved by the Lao people themselves. He said that the Lao situation has nothing to do with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) military bloc or the United Nations. He also said that the recent negotiations in Luang Prabang, attended by the Phoumi Nosavan-Oun Heuan Norasingh-Boun Oum Na Champassak group, had nothing to do with the government. Prince Phouma also said that the government would soon hold talks with the Lao Fighting Units.

Prime Minister Phouma stated that the Lao government pursues a policy of peace and neutrality. He said that the government will soon establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, which the King has already approved. In addition, Laos has also accepted aid from countries such as Cambodia and Burma.

Subsequently, Captain Kong Le, Chairman of the Coup Committee, also spoke at the rally. He called on all Lao people to support the Coup Committee and the government of Prince Souvanna Phouma.

The participants in the rally cheered loudly, expressing their approval and support for the government's policies.

Before the rally, the masses held a demonstration. The demonstration marched through the streets of the capital, Vientiane, with many banners and slogans supporting the government, and finally converged at That Luang Square for a rally.

The demonstrators also distributed leaflets demanding that the government hold talks with the Lao Fighting Units, quickly implement a policy of peace and neutrality, resolutely make no concessions to the Savannakhet rebel group, and not allow the United Nations and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to interfere in Lao internal affairs.

    新华社河内6日电　据万象电台今天广播：老挝首相富马亲王4日在万象群众集会上说，老挝目前局势是老挝人内部的事情，应由老挝人自己来解决。他说，老挝局势同东南亚条约军事集团和联合国毫无关系。他又说，最近，富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞集团参加的在琅勃拉邦举行的谈判同政府毫无关系。富马亲王还说，不久政府就要同寮国战斗部队进行会谈。
    富马首相表示，老挝政府奉行和平中立政策。他说，政府即将同苏联建立外交关系，这一点国王已经批准了。此外，老挝还接受了柬埔寨和缅甸等国的援助。
    接着，政变委员会主席贡勒大尉也在集会上讲了话。他呼吁全体老挝人民支持政变委员会和梭发那·富马亲王政府。
    参加集会的人高声欢呼，表示赞成和支持政府的政策。
    在举行这次集会前，群众举行了示威游行。游行队伍带着许多写着支持政府的口号的横幅标语，通过首都万象市各街道，最后汇集在金塔地方举行大会。
    游行队伍还散发传单，要求政府同寮国战斗部队进行会谈，迅速实现和平中立政策，对沙湾拿吉叛乱集团坚决不作任何让步，不容许联合国和东南亚条约军事集团干涉老挝内政。
