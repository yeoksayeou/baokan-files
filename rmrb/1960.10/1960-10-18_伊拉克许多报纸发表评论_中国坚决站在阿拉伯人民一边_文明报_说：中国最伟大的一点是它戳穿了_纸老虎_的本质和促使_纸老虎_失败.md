Many Iraqi newspapers have published editorials celebrating the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The "Sawt al-Ahrar" published an editorial on the 2nd, stating that the rise of the People's Republic of China, its consistent adherence to standing on the side of peace forces, and its effective contributions to the liberation cause of various countries have brought tremendous strength to the people of these countries, raising their status and making it easier for them to achieve victory. The editorial stated that the People's Republic of China has proven at all times that it firmly and forever supports national liberation movements around the world. "Sawt al-Ahrar" also said that on this joyful day, our loyal Iraqi people express their deep wishes: may the dear Chinese people achieve success and prosperity, and liberate their territory of Taiwan.

The "Al-Sha'ab" editorial on the 2nd stated that the founding of the People's Republic of China, such a great day in Asian history, is considered one of the most important historical moments in the lives of the people of this continent.

"Al-Sha'ab" said that we join the great and friendly Chinese people in celebrating the birth of the People's Republic of China, which sincerely and consistently strives to help the people of other countries. "Al-Sha'ab" emphasized that we believe that all liberated countries must redouble their efforts to allow the People's China to enter the United Nations.

The "Al-Istiqlal" published an editorial on the 1st stating that the great Chinese people, after a long period of cruel and sharp struggle, defeated imperialism and its agents. Their victory has inspired and continues to inspire people fighting for freedom and independence. The establishment of the People's Republic of China can be said to be a clear starting point for the surging national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and other places under imperialism or foreign forces, the newspaper said.

The Iraqi "Al-Zaman" said that the liberation of 650 million Chinese people is one of the most significant events in the post-war world, especially in the Far East.

The newspaper said that China has played an outstanding role in maintaining world peace, supporting and consolidating the national liberation movements of Asia and Africa, and fighting against imperialism and aggression. China's contribution to the Bandung Conference is a clear example. Based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence of the Bandung Principles, the People's Republic of China has established friendly and cooperative relations with some countries, thereby consolidating the cause of world peace, ensuring the stability and security of the Far East, and crushing all kinds of imperialist conspiracies.

Both newspapers mentioned the support given by the People's Republic of China to the Iraqi revolution and other Arab peoples opposing imperialism. "Al-Zaman" said that China very firmly stands on the side of the Arab people and does everything possible to support their aspirations, rights, and just demands. Both newspapers condemned imperialism's obstruction of China's restoration of its legitimate seat in the United Nations.

The "Al-Kifah" published an editorial on September 30, stating that the establishment of the People's Republic of China began a new era in the struggle of the Chinese people and all Asian and African people for peace, freedom, democracy, and happiness, and towards economic, political, and cultural progress. The existence of the People's Republic of China has also played an outstanding role in stopping the war and aggression forces of imperialism and its lackeys.

The editorial also praised China's foreign policy of maintaining the cause of peace, supporting the national liberation movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggle for freedom, progress, and self-determination, and expressed the hope that the friendship between Iraq and China will further develop and consolidate.

The Iraqi "Al-Tamaddun" said on the 2nd that China has demonstrated its greatness in all aspects, and the greatest of these is that it has exposed the essence of the "paper tiger" and caused the "paper tiger" to fail.

    伊拉克许多报纸发表社论庆祝中华人民共和国成立十一周年。
    “自由人之声报”2日发表社论说，中华人民共和国的兴起和它一贯坚持站在和平力量的方面以及它对各国人民解放事业所作出的有效贡献，已经把巨大的力量带给这些国家的人民，来提高他们的地位和使他们更加容易地获得胜利。社论说，中华人民共和国在任何时候都证明，它坚定和永远支持全世界的民族解放运动。“自由人之声报”还说，在这个愉快的日子，我们忠实的伊拉克人民表示他们深厚的祝愿：祝亲爱的中国人民获得成就和繁荣，并解放他们的领土台湾。
    “国民报”2日的社论说，中华人民共和国成立这样一个亚洲历史上伟大的日子，被认为是这个大陆上各国人民生活中最重要的历史时刻之一。
    “国民报”说，我们同伟大友好的中国人民共同欢庆中华人民共和国的诞生，它真诚地一贯地为帮助其它国家人民而努力。“国民报”强调说，我们认为，所有解放了的国家都必须加倍努力使人民中国进入联合国。
    “独立报”1日发表社论说，伟大的中国人民经过长期的残酷和尖锐的斗争，战胜了帝国主义及其代理人，他们的胜利鼓舞了并且继续鼓舞着为争取自由和独立而斗争的人民。这家报纸说，中华人民共和国的建立可以说是亚洲、非洲和其他处于帝国主义或外国势力之下的地方的民族解放运动风起云涌的鲜明起点。
    伊拉克“时代报”说，六亿五千万中国人民的解放是战后世界、特别是远东的最重大事件之一。
    报纸说，中国在维护世界和平、支持和巩固亚非的民族解放运动、反对帝国主义和侵略的斗争中起了杰出的作用。中国在万隆会议上的贡献就是一个明证。根据万隆原则，中华人民共和国在和平共处五项原则的基础上同一些国家建立了友好和合作的关系，从而巩固了世界和平事业，保证了远东的稳定和安全和粉碎了形形色色的帝国主义阴谋。
    这两家报纸都谈到中华人民共和国给予伊拉克革命和其他反对帝国主义的阿拉伯人民的声援。“时代报”说，中国非常坚决地站在阿拉伯人民这一边，并尽一切办法支持他们的期望、权利和正义要求。这两家报纸都谴责帝国主义阻挠中国恢复它在联合国的合法席位。
    “斗争报”9月30日发表社论说，在中国人民和全体亚洲和非洲人民争取和平、自由、民主和幸福，迈向经济、政治和文化进步的斗争中，中华人民共和国的建立开始了一个新时期。中华人民共和国的存在对制止帝国主义及其走狗的战争侵略势力也起了杰出的作用。
    社论还赞扬中国奉行的维护和平事业，支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民争取自由、进步和自决的民族解放运动的外交政策，并表示希望伊中两国的友谊将进一步发展和巩固。
    伊拉克“文明报”2日说，中国在各方面表现了它的伟大，其中最伟大的一点是它戳穿了“纸老虎”的本质和促使“纸老虎”失败。
