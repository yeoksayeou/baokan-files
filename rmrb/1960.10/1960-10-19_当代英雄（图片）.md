Contemporary Heroes

    Cao Guanfu, a sewing worker at the Shanghai No. 101 Garment Factory, has sewn more than 750,000 pieces of clothing since 1954, with only one second-class product. For seven years, he has exceeded his monthly quota every month. Since 1958, he has not received a second new needle, except for receiving a new needle due to product changes. The sewing machine he operated has not been repaired once in seven years, making him a model worker in Shanghai for achieving an all-round leap forward in high yield, high quality, economy, and safety.

    当代英雄
    上海一○一服装厂缝纫工曹关福，从一九五四年到现在，共缝制了七十五万多件衣服，只出过一件二等品。七年来，月月超额完成计划。从一九五八年到现在，除因为品种调动领了一枚新针外，没有领过第二枚新针。他操作过的缝纫机，七年来没有修过一次，成为上海市一个高产、优质、节约、安全全面跌进的标兵。　新华社记者　杨溥涛摄
