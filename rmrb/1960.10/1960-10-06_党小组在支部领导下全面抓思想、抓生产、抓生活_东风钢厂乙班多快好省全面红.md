    The Party Group Comprehensively Grasps Ideology, Production, and Life Under the Leadership of the Party Branch
    The Second Shift of Dongfeng Steel Plant Achieves All-Around Redness with More, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results
    (Our report) A vigorous competition to learn from and catch up with the Second Shift is being carried out at the Dongfeng Steel Plant in Changsha City. The Second Shift has become a model for all the plant's employees and a consistently high-quality, high-yield red banner on the Changsha steelmaking front. In the twelve-month competition from October of last year to September of this year, with the same equipment, the same manpower, and the same technology, this shift produced more than one hundred tons of steel than other shifts at the Dongfeng Steel Plant. The qualified rate of steel ingots has also consistently ranked first since December of last year, averaging above 97%, and they have also created an excellent record of 161 consecutive heats without waste steel. They not only have high output and good quality, but also low consumption of raw materials and few accidents. Compared with other shifts, the cost per ton of steel produced from January to September is about 18% lower.
    The main reason why the Second Shift of Dongfeng Steel Plant has achieved such brilliant results is that the Party Group of this shift has fully played its role as a fighting bastion, making this shift a strong fighting organization with the Party Group as its core. Under the leadership and help of the Party Committee of the plant and the Party Branch of the workshop, the Party Group of the Second Shift comprehensively grasps ideology, production, and life. It has a high prestige within the shift and has become the organizer and inspirer of the entire shift's struggles.
    The Party Group grasps ideology by first organizing all the workers in the shift to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds and guide production. Since the beginning of this year, the whole shift has studied Mao Zedong's works such as "Introducing a Cooperative," "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and, in connection with reality, often used Mao Zedong Thought to solve practical problems in production. After the Party Group Leader and Shift Leader Yang Zhengqiu and Party Member and Deputy Shift Leader Luo Binchu studied "On Contradiction" at the Party School run by the Plant Party Committee, they returned to the shift and led everyone in studying the method of analyzing contradictions, identifying the main contradiction in production, and organizing forces to tackle the key to improving the production level of the pig iron furnace. In May of this year, production in the shift was not good for a time. What was the reason? Mainly some complacency and slackening. The Party Group organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works, establishing the idea of continuous revolution. After everyone's awareness was raised, they became more motivated, and production has been even more outstanding since June. The Party Group of this shift also paid special attention to cultivating the workers' revolutionary will to fight stubbornly against difficulties, and the workers can bravely and resourcefully overcome various difficulties.
    The Party Group grasps production mainly by unifying understanding, unifying thought, and unifying action. They hold Party Group meetings or expanded Party Group meetings every month to check and analyze production, discuss tasks and measures, and after making resolutions, the shift leader takes the lead in implementing them, with all Party members taking the lead in mobilizing the masses to implement them. In this way, there are many methods, quick action, and good results. Party Group meetings frequently carry out criticism and self-criticism to continuously strengthen the combat effectiveness of the Party organization. For some issues where opinions differ, a unified understanding must be sought within the Party Group.
    The Party Group comrades and leading cadres of this shift are also good at working with the masses to continuously summarize positive and negative experiences from production practice, exploring and mastering the laws of production. For example, in converter steelmaking, based on the actual results of each heat in each shift, they summarized a set of operating experience for converters: "Master the angle, see the flame accurately, focus on blowing, and shake frequently but move little." They have also explored a set of methods for scientifically organizing production in each battle.
    The comrades of the Party Group are very concerned about the lives of the masses, treating the pain of the masses as their own pain. Some time ago, worker Lu Zongping had some financial difficulties because his wife was sick and he had five children at home. Deputy Shift Leader and Party Member Luo Binchu went to offer condolences, helped Lu Zongping calculate his expenses, arranged his life according to the spirit of diligence and thrift, and promptly reported the situation to the trade union, providing appropriate subsidies. Lu Zongping said with emotion, "The Party cares for me so much, it is even closer than my parents." His enthusiasm for production became even greater.
    The Party Group of the Second Shift is good at uniting the masses. The Party Group has united a group of strong backbones. The most effective, capable, and prestigious among the masses are the eight tiger generals. Their common characteristics are: listening to the Party, being resourceful and courageous, advancing in the face of difficulties, studying technology, and having their own expertise. They are also good at influencing and motivating the masses, maintaining a close relationship with the masses. They consult with the masses on everything, listen to everyone's opinions, and each of them has united a group of capable assistants. In this way, the entire shift has formed a strong and united fighting collective.

    党小组在支部领导下全面抓思想、抓生产、抓生活
    东风钢厂乙班多快好省全面红
    本报讯　在长沙市东风钢厂，一个学乙班、赶乙班的竞赛运动轰轰烈烈地开展起来，炼钢乙班已经成为这个厂全体职工学习的榜样，也是长沙市炼钢战线一面持续优质高产的红旗。炼钢乙班在从去年10月到今年9月十二个月的竞赛中，在同样设备、同样人力、同样技术条件下，他们这一班比东风钢厂其他班多产了一百多吨钢。钢锭合格率从去年12月以来也一直名列第一，平均稳定在97％以上，还创造了连续一百六十一炉无废钢的优异成绩。他们不但产量高、质量好，而且原料材料消耗低、各种事故少，与其他班比较，
  1至9月每炼一吨钢的成本要低18％左右。
    东风钢厂炼钢乙班创造这样辉煌成绩的主要原因，是这个班的党小组充分发挥了战斗堡垒作用，使这个班以党小组为核心形成了一个坚强的战斗组织。炼钢乙班党小组在厂党委和车间党支部的领导和帮助下，全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活，在班内具有很高的威信，成为全班战斗的组织者、鼓舞者。
    党小组抓思想，首先是组织全班工人认真学习毛主席的著作，用毛主席的思想武装全班工人的头脑和指导生产。今年以来，全班学习了毛主席的《介绍一个合作社》、《矛盾论》、《实践论》、《愚公移山》等著作，并且以理论联系实际，经常运用毛主席的思想来解决生产中的实际问题。党小组长、班长杨正球和党员、副班长罗斌初，在厂党委办的党校学习了《矛盾论》以后，回到班里就领导大家学习分析矛盾的办法，找出生产中的主要矛盾，组织力量围攻提高化铁炉生产水平的关键。今年5月份，班内生产一度不够好，什么原因呢？主要是有些自满松劲。党小组组织大家学习毛主席著作，树立了不断革命的思想。大家觉悟提高了，干劲更足了，6月份以来生产更加出色。这个班的党小组还特别注意培养工人们同困难顽强斗争的革命意志，工人都能勇敢、机智地去战胜各种困难。
    党小组抓生产，主要是统一认识，统一思想，统一行动。他们每个月都召开党小组会或党小组扩大会，检查分析生产情况，讨论任务、措施，作出决议后由班长具体抓，由全体党员带头，发动群众贯彻。这样，就办法多、行动快、效果好。党小组会经常开展批评与自我批评，不断加强党组织的战斗性。对某些看法不一致的问题，一定在党小组内争得水落石出，求得一个统一的认识。
    这个班的党小组和领导干部还善于和群众一起，从生产实践中不断地总结正面和反面的经验，摸索和掌握生产规律。例如，他们在转炉吹炼中，根据每班每炉不同的实际效果，总结出了转炉“掌握角度，看准火焰，以吹为主，勤摇少动”等一套操作经验。他们还摸索出了一套在每一个战役科学地组织生产的办法。
    党小组的同志很关心群众的生活，把群众的痛痒看成是自己的痛痒。前些时候，工人卢宗平因为爱人生病，家里又有五个小孩，生活一时比较困难。副班长、党员罗斌初去进行了慰问，又帮卢宗平算账，按勤俭精神安排了生活，并及时向工会反映情况，给予适当补助。卢宗平感动地说：“党这样关心我，真比爹娘还亲。”他的生产劲头更大了。
    炼钢乙班党小组善于团结群众。党小组周围团结了一批强有力的骨干。这批骨干中最得力、最有本事、在群众中最有威信的是八名虎将。他们的共同特点是：听党的话，谋勇兼备，遇难而进，钻研技术，各有专长。他们还善于影响和带动群众，与群众保持着水乳交融的关系。他们遇事同群众商量，倾听大家意见，各自又团结了一批得力的左右手。这样，全班就形成了一个坚强的团结的战斗集体。
