Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: The Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Ministry of Culture held a banquet at the Xinqiao Hotel tonight to warmly welcome the Soviet Artists Performing Troupe led by Goncharok.

    Qu Wu, Vice-Chairman of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, spoke at the banquet. He said that in a few days, the forty-third anniversary of the great October Revolution will arrive. At this time, it is of great significance that the comrades of the Soviet Artists Performing Troupe have come to our country for a visit and performance. We express our heartfelt welcome to this.

    Qu Wu said that for forty-three years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have made great achievements and have now entered the historical period of carrying out communist construction. We are overjoyed by every achievement made by the Soviet people. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people victoriously completed the First Five-Year Plan in 1957 and then completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule in 1959. Now, they are continuing to forge ahead, holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.

    Qu Wu emphasized that the Chinese people have a deep friendship with the Soviet people. The Chinese people have always cherished the unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples like the apple of their eye, and anyone who attempts to undermine our unity will be thoroughly defeated.

    Goncharok said in his speech that the purpose of our friendly visit and performance in China this time is to enhance cultural exchanges between the Soviet Union and China. Our performance troupe is composed of outstanding actors selected from various regions, including singers, ballet dancers, puppeteers, and other artists. We hope to further enhance and consolidate the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples through this visit and performance.

    During the banquet, the hosts and guests frequently raised their glasses and toasted to the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. The comrades of the performing troupe also enthusiastically sang beautiful Soviet songs.

    Among those attending the banquet were: Li Lun, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Arts Administration of the Ministry of Culture; Bian Cheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Zhao Feng, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association; Dai Ailian, Principal of the Beijing Dance School; and Ding Bo, Manager of the China Performing Arts Agency.

    Romanin, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, was also invited to attend the banquet.

    Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: The Soviet Artists Performing Troupe, a group of twenty-nine people led by Goncharok, arrived in Beijing by plane this morning. The art troupe was invited to visit and perform in our country in accordance with the 1960 execution plan of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Cooperation Agreement.
