    Random Notes from the Deer Farm
    Zhong Liqun
    Around noon, we passed through the Guanmen Mountain pass and arrived at Liukeli Village. The Jiaohe Deer Farm, surrounded by dense oak forests, was quietly bathed in sunlight. As we approached the deer farm along the mountain path lined with deer enclosures, a silver bell suddenly rang, and a sika deer calf leaped towards us. Then, a young man with a dark complexion and bright eyes appeared at the entrance of the deer farm, warmly inviting us into the world of deer.

    The deer farm was exceptionally clean and quiet. The deer enclosures were built in rows. On the open space beside the enclosures, groups of two or three does and fawns were standing next to a cluster of oak leaves. Some leisurely nibbled on the tender leaves, while others held their heads high, ears perked, intently watching the new arrivals. In the deer farm's workshop, two newly born fawns, raised on goat milk, had already grown to over a foot tall. The farm had already artificially raised eleven deer. These completely domesticated deer had been grazed on the mountains and had drunk water by the lake. As soon as they were called, they would run to the side of their trainers. Deer are sensitive and suspicious wild animals. They never easily try roads they have not walked or food they have not eaten. Even changes in feed taste or cloudy drinking water would cause them to refuse to eat or drink. Deer prefer quiet; crowds, mixed accents, and brightly colored clothes can also cause suspicion. The young man accompanying us, named Sun Jiliang, was precisely the experimenter of deer domestication. After graduating from school in 1957, he dedicated himself to deer farming and is now the deer farm's technician and the leader of the deer farming team. Sun Jiliang told us with confidence: "Deer domestication is not too difficult. We have already gained preliminary experience. As long as more and more deer are domesticated, we can use the gregarious nature of deer to implement large-scale grazing. At that time, the undomesticated deer will not leave the herd."

    We went from one deer enclosure to another. Old technician Xu Zhendong, who had been raising deer for twenty-five years, contributed his valuable experience in deer farming since stepping from the landlord's estate to the socialist deer farm after liberation. This deer farming expert, born into a poor peasant family, urged us to walk generously and never tiptoe or be flustered, otherwise the sensitive deer herd would panic and cause damage. This deer farm adopts the "enclosure group feeding" method, dividing and enclosing bucks, does, and fawns; does in the calving period are also fed in small groups; those with bad habits are placed in separate small enclosures. We first pushed open the wooden door of the buck enclosure, and a group of strong bucks, with their tall antler horns, stood "heroically" on the bluestone-paved enclosure ground. Bucks are naturally fond of beauty, constantly scrutinizing their beautiful antler horns in the water when drinking. Excessive suspicion is also a characteristic of bucks; sometimes they suddenly raise their front hooves and kick each other's antler horns. The situation is even more intense during mating and courtship, often requiring the deer farmers to mediate. To prevent mutual injury, the deer farmers selectively cultivate "king deer" among the few bucks placed in the doe herd, creating an imposing presence for one buck to subdue the others, to facilitate the smooth progress of mating. Now is the season for large-scale antler harvesting, and the bucks' antler horns are particularly red and bright. Bucks whose antler horns were harvested earlier have grown short new horns on their heads and can be harvested again this year. While accompanying us on the tour, old technician Xu and the deer farmers examined the growth of each buck's antler horns to determine the target for antler harvesting the next day. Deer antler horns change day by day, and the timing of antler harvesting must be grasped just right, otherwise the horn's keratinization will reduce its economic value. Antler protection is hard work, requiring the deer herd to be kept quiet day and night, and even more careful protection is needed during the mating season (August 20 to the end of November).

    The doe enclosure was even quieter. Deer farming model worker Niu Enlong was whistling, herding the deer from the inner enclosure to the outer enclosure. The plump does, covered in yellow fur with clean white round spots, looked very docile. The fawns born in the spring, seeing strangers enter the enclosure, panicked and jumped around, very different in temperament from the artificially raised fawns. After a moment of environmental stability, the fawns reunited with their mothers. Everyone looked in the direction pointed by Niu Enlong: a fawn had just finished nursing from one doe and burrowed under the belly of another doe to suckle. This deer farmer explained the characteristics of does: "The maternal instinct of deer is very strong. As soon as they hear any fawn bleating, they will automatically run to give milk." Then, he led us to another deer enclosure. Enclosed here was a group of does just over one year old, smaller in stature, who would also participate in mating this year, called育成母鹿 (Yùchéng mǔlù)育成母鹿or first-time does. This experiment of early breeding has been very effective after two years of practice. This year, Yùchéng mǔlùaccount for one-third of the does prepared for mating on the farm. Niu Enlong said humorously: "The 'maternal instinct' of some Yùchéng mǔlù has to be cultivated. Because they have no experience, they will be terrified and stay far away after calving, taking a long time before they dare to turn around and call their fawns, sometimes even trampling the fawns in panic." Due to proper mating and fawn protection, the survival rate of fawns on the farm last year was 87.4%, which increased to 90% this year, with a twin rate of 3%. Currently, the deer farmers in the doe group are working with the deer farmers in the buck group to strive for a pregnancy rate of 99% for the does, to breed more fawns for the country.

    The next morning, at three o'clock, when the sky had just turned fish-belly white, deer farm watchman Zhou Fengcai gently woke us up: it was time to saw the antler horns. We hurriedly put on our clothes and walked towards the deer enclosure, hearing a burst of rapid hoofbeats. Through the crack in the door, we could see a buck swiftly rushing into a high, narrow wooden house, and the person hiding behind the door immediately closed the door tightly. After a few seconds of struggling, the door reopened, and the buck had been hung in the air, with two deer farmers steadily holding its head. Sun Jiliang silently walked into the house, agilely sawing off a pair of antler horns in a minute or two, and readily applied a good medicine for disinfection and hemostasis to the buck. At this time, the crowd immediately dispersed, the rope was loosened, and the buck suddenly jumped out of the wooden house and ran into the inner enclosure. We followed old technician Xu to the antler-cooking room. The antler-cooking room was divided into two rooms, the inner room with screens all around, and nearly a hundred pairs of antler horns neatly hung on the beams. The stove in the outer room had two large pots filled with boiling water, which were used for cooking the antlers. Old technician Xu collected every drop of deer blood from the newly sawn antler horns, carefully sewed the sawn ends of the antler horns, then tied the antler horns to wooden forks, immersed them in boiling water, and only after repeating this several times, hung the antler horns high. The whole deer is a treasure. Deer antler horns, deer fetuses, and deer blood are precious medicinal raw materials. Deer antler extract, whole deer tonic pills, and deer fetus cream are effective tonics. Deer have high economic value, with each sika deer worth more than ten thousand yuan. For deer antler alone, the net income from antler production per buck is about five hundred yuan per year. This deer farm produced 1,377 taels of antler in the past two years, and this year's antler production will reach 80% of the total of the previous two years.

    On the eve of our departure, the deer farmers introduced us to a series of valuable experiences and achievements in antler production, mating, calving, and planting deer feed. Due to these achievements, this deer farm has become a red flag deer farm in Jilin Province, and this year's mobile red flag has been hanging high here.

    鹿圈散记
    钟立群
    近午的时分，我们穿过关门山隘，来到了六棵梨树屯。被密茂的柞树林围绕的蛟河鹿场，静静地沐浴在阳光中。当我们沿着两旁堆满鹿砦的山道走近鹿场的时候，突然间银铃声响，一只梅花小鹿迎面跳跃而来。接着，一位肤色黧黑、两眼晶亮的青年人出现在鹿场门口，热情地把我们引进鹿的世界。
    鹿场里异常清洁和宁静。鹿圈成排地建筑在一起。在圈旁的空坪上，三三两两的母鹿和小鹿正站在一丛柞树叶的旁边。有的悠闲地啃着嫩叶，有的高高地昂着头，竖着耳，聚精会神地看着新来的客人。在鹿场的工作室中，两只出生不久的鹿羔，已经用羊奶哺育长到一尺多高。全场用人工哺乳法喂大的鹿已经有十一只。这些完全驯化的鹿，已经到山上放过牧，到湖边饮过水，只要一招呼，就会跑到驯养者的身边。鹿是一种敏感多疑的野生动物，凡是它们没有走过的路，没有吃过的食料，从来不肯轻易尝试，甚至饲料味道变化，饮水浑浊，都不吃不喝。鹿性喜安静，人多，口音杂和衣服颜色鲜艳，也会引起疑惧。陪同我们参观的青年人，正是驯鹿的尝试者，名叫孙继良。1957年他在学校毕业后，就献身于养鹿工作，现在是鹿场的技术员兼养鹿队队长。孙继良满有信心地告诉我们：“鹿的驯化并不是太难的事，我们已经取得了初步的经验。只要驯化的鹿越来越多，就可以利用鹿的合群的特性，实行大量放牧，那时未驯化的鹿也不会离群而去。”
    我们从一个鹿圈到另一个鹿圈。养了二十五年鹿的老技师徐振东，解放后从地主的庄园踏上社会主义的鹿场以来，贡献了自己养鹿的宝贵经验。这位贫农出身的养鹿能手，叮咛我们大大方方地走路，千万不要蹑手蹑脚或者慌慌张张，否则敏感的鹿群会惊恐乱窜，造成损伤。这个鹿场采取“圈养群饲”的方法，分群分圈饲养公鹿、母鹿和仔鹿；产羔期的母鹿，还要实行小群饲养；有恶癖的另外纳入小圈。我们首先推开公鹿圈舍的木门，一群矫健的公鹿，耸起高高的茸角，“英姿勃勃”地站在青石铺设的圈地上。公鹿天生爱美，饮水的时候，不断地向水中端详着自己美丽的茸角。多忌也是公鹿的特性，有时会突然举起前蹄，互相踢践对方的茸角。在配种争偶的时候，情况更加激烈，经常需要养鹿员们排解。为了防止两败俱伤，养鹿员们要在放入母鹿群的几只公鹿中，有选择地培养“王鹿”，为一只公鹿虚张声势，使其他的公鹿慑伏，以利于配种的顺利进行。现在正是大量采茸的季节，公鹿的茸角分外红亮。早些时候采过一次茸角的公鹿，头上又长出短短的新角来，今年还可以再采一次。徐老技师一边陪同我们参观，一边和养鹿员们察看每一只公鹿的茸角的成长情况，确定第二天采茸的对象。鹿茸角一天一个样，采茸的时机要掌握得恰到好处，不然角质硬化了，就会降低经济价值。护茸工作很辛苦，日夜都要保持鹿群的安静，在配种时期（8月20日至11月末），更要精心护茸。
    母鹿圈舍更加安静。养鹿标兵牛恩龙正?喝着鹿群从里圈聚集到外圈来。肥满的母鹿披着一身间有洁白圆斑的黄毛，显得十分温顺。春天产下的小鹿，看到陌生的人走进圈中，惊慌得东纵西跳，同人工哺育的小鹿相比，性情大不相同。环境安定片刻之后，小鹿才重新偎依在母鹿身旁。大家随着牛恩龙手指的方向看去：一只小鹿刚从一只母鹿那里吃过奶，又钻到另一只母鹿的腹下吸食。这位养鹿员解释母鹿的特性说：“鹿的母性很强，只要听到任何一只小鹿鸣叫，就会自动跑去送奶。”接着，他带领我们走到另一个鹿圈。这里圈养的是一群刚过周岁的母鹿，体态较小，今年也将参加配种，取名为育成母鹿或者叫初产母鹿。这种提前育成配种的尝试，经过两年的实践，效果很好。今年，在全场准备参加配种的母鹿中，育成母鹿占三分之一。牛恩龙满有风趣地说：“有些育成母鹿的‘母性’可得培养，它们由于没有经验，产羔后会惊恐得远远避开，要过好一阵才敢转身来唤自己的小羔，有时甚至会慌得把鹿羔踏伤。”由于配种护羔得法，去年全场仔鹿繁殖成活率为87.4％，今年提高到90％，双羔率为3％，目前，母鹿组的养鹿员们还要和公鹿组的养鹿员们一起，争取母鹿的孕成率达到99％，为国家繁殖更多的仔鹿。
    第二天清晨三点多钟，天刚刚露出鱼肚白色，鹿场更夫周凤才轻轻叫醒我们：锯茸的时刻到了。我们匆忙地披好衣走向鹿圈，只听见一阵急促的蹄声，从门缝中可以看到：一只公鹿迅猛地冲进一座高狭的小木房，躲在门后的人立即把门关紧。几秒钟的挣扎声之后，房门重新打开，公鹿已经被悬空吊起，两位养鹿员稳稳按住它的头。孙继良一声不响走进房去，敏捷地在一两分钟之内把一双茸角锯了下来，随手为公鹿敷上消毒止血的良药。这时，人群立即散开，绳子松脱，公鹿蓦地跃出木房，跑进里圈。我们跟着徐老技师来到了炸茸房。炸茸房分为里外两间，里间四周装着纱窗，横梁上整整齐齐挂着近百对茸角。外间的灶上有两口盛满沸水的大锅，是用来炸茸的。徐老技师一点一滴地收集着新锯下的茸角中的鹿血，细细缝好茸角的锯断面，然后把茸角捆在木杈上，浸入沸水中，反复几次以后，才把茸角高高挂起。鹿全身是宝，鹿茸角、鹿胎、鹿血都是珍贵的医药原料，鹿茸精、全鹿大补丸、鹿胎膏就是卓有成效的滋补品。鹿的经济价值很高，每一头梅花鹿价值一万多元。仅鹿茸一项，一头公鹿每年产茸的纯收入为五百元左右。这个鹿场过去两年产茸一千三百七十七两，今年的产茸量将达到前两年总和的80％。
    临别前夕，养鹿员们向我们介绍了产茸、配种、产羔和种植鹿饲料的一系列宝贵的经验和成绩。由于这方面的成就，这个鹿场成为全吉林省的红旗鹿场，今年的流动红旗一直高挂在这里。
