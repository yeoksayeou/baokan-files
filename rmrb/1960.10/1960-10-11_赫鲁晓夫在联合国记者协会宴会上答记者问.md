Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 8th (TASS):

    The Soviet Premier's press team reports:

    The United Nations Correspondents Association held a banquet on October 7th to host Nikita Khrushchev, the head of the Soviet delegation to the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR.

    Mr. Sanders, the President of the Association, warmly welcomed Khrushchev on behalf of the members of the Association and thanked him for agreeing to meet with the correspondents stationed at the United Nations. Sanders said:

    Mr. Chairman,

    When we sent our invitation to you on the "Baltika," we did not foresee that upon your arrival here, you would generously agree to hold a press conference. We mistakenly thought that your acceptance of our invitation would give us some advantage. Now, we see that this might be interpreted as a special monopoly, which you would certainly not approve of.

    I must say that your interactions with the press can only be described as the most democratic.

    I have had the opportunity to observe you during the weeks of the UN General Assembly, and I have heard much talk about you. I think the press and you have something in common. Some say you are an emotional person. But, Mr. Chairman, emotion is a source of news for us. As people, we have feelings, no matter how hard we try to be objective. You, like us, like to "show yourself," and for that, we like you.

    But we know you best as a great propagandist for the idea of coexistence. We are very pleased to welcome you among us – people who are turning the idea of coexistence into a living reality. We represent different countries, and our backgrounds are different. We hold different political beliefs. We write articles in newspapers and magazines, or we work for radio stations that represent the broadest spectrum of opinion. But among us, there is a spirit of friendship that could not be better. We do not argue about issues that might divide us, and if there were not so many emergency meetings and late-night sessions, we would often discuss various issues among ourselves, trying to figure out the reasons for these difficulties. So, you see, coexistence is not a problem for us, although it may be a difficult problem for the world.

    But we simply do not know whether you and others can achieve success in the cause of embodying the idea of coexistence in life, in the life of the whole world, and how you will achieve it. We hope you will explain this issue to us along with other issues.

    Finally, I would like to say in Russian, if my pronunciation is not so bad: "Welcome."

    Gentlemen, I now introduce to you Chairman Nikita Khrushchev.

    Then, Khrushchev spoke.

    Khrushchev said to warm applause:

    Mr. President of the Association! Respected Gentlemen, Comrades, Friends!

    I am very pleased to meet with you, the correspondents who report on the work of the United Nations. I often have the opportunity to meet with reporters. Your profession is difficult, but it is noble. The press can help people correctly understand everything that is happening in the complex modern world. But the press can also mislead people if it is used to achieve the selfish goals of certain groups.

    You have had a lot of work lately. The 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly is the most significant meeting since the founding of the United Nations. This meeting will discuss such extremely important international issues as disarmament and the complete elimination of the shameful system of colonialism. We believe that the smooth and unanimous resolution of these issues is of particular significance. Disarmament is in the interests of all countries, because it is the only way to avoid a new devastating war.

    I do not need to show you that these issues, like other issues, can be resolved as long as there is sincerity, a willingness to cooperate among countries on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence and renunciation of aggressive actions, and adherence to the norms of international law.

    In the current situation, it is absurd to attempt to impose this or that resolution on other countries with the help of a mechanical majority in the United Nations. The United Nations must be able to take into account the interests of all existing groups of countries, both the interests of the countries that make up the Western military bloc, and the interests of the socialist countries and neutral countries. Establishing working bodies of the United Nations with corresponding structures would help to improve the work of the United Nations.

    I urge all of you to use the power of the pen, your abilities, and your influence to create a situation conducive to the activities of the United Nations, and I urge you to write truthfully. Let the millions of your readers have a true and realistic picture of the modern world and the problems we all face.

    Frederic, a female reporter for "National Broadcasting Company," asked:

    Mr. Chairman! Do you think there is any hope of making progress in disarmament before the differences between the United States and the Soviet Union have been eased and concerns and distrust have been eliminated?

    Khrushchev: I think that if we give up hope of reaching a disarmament agreement, it would mean condemning the world to a new war, meaning signing a confession that those who should be considering peace and creating conditions for peaceful coexistence have no power. Therefore, I am still optimistic about the possibility of reaching a disarmament agreement, and I have said more than once that such conditions exist.

    It is difficult to determine to what extent these conditions are ripe now, because this session of the UN General Assembly has coincided with a "stormy period" in the lives of the American people. I am referring to the presidential election. Everyone in the United States is busy with this now, everything is subordinated to this, and those who are concerned with solving the problem of disarmament are now only considering which candidate will be elected president. This is a sad phenomenon, because the president can be this person or that person, and this has no decisive effect on international issues, because it is a domestic issue of a country. Since everything in the United States is now subordinated to the election, we should take this into account. But this is a temporary phenomenon.

    I would like to elaborate on one more issue in this regard. I would like to correct a piece of news, which is the news published in the American newspapers about my meeting with Mr. Macmillan. The reports in the newspapers about the results of my meeting and conversation with British Prime Minister Macmillan are not entirely accurate.

    We did indeed talk about the issue of disarmament and the possibility of reaching an agreement on this issue. Mr. Macmillan said that there was no need to rush to solve this problem, and that we should wait until better conditions have been created for trust between countries. At that time, an agreement on disarmament could also be reached. Mr. Macmillan believes that in order to create an atmosphere of trust, it may take about five to ten years, and that it would be best to establish some kind of technical expert committee to study these issues. In short, he suggested moving forward slowly, just like many insects, snails, and other not very flexible organisms crawling on the ground.

    We believe that we must make every effort to ensure peace, not sit idly by, but continue to fight tenaciously for peaceful coexistence, for disarmament, and for ensuring a solid peace throughout the world. But the main point in the struggle to consolidate peace is disarmament, not the supervision of armaments suggested by US President Eisenhower. I repeat, although I have repeated this many times, I will repeat it until everyone understands: disarmament, the destruction of weapons, is the only way to avoid war, while the supervision of armaments is the preservation of weapons. If weapons are preserved, even under supervision, those who possess weapons can always use them to achieve aggressive purposes when they want to. Therefore, whoever truly wants peace should not fight for the supervision of armaments, but should fight for disarmament, for the destruction of weapons under the strictest, broadest, and most in-depth international supervision.

    If, as some people do, the issue of disarmament is made dependent on the easing of international tensions and the establishment of trust, then I tell you that it is very dangerous to raise the issue in this way. It is like arguing about whether the chicken came first or the egg (laughter in the audience). It seems to me that the question of whether the chicken came first or the egg has not been resolved to this day. Therefore, it will not be fruitful to talk about where to start in reaching a disarmament agreement, whether to start with creating conditions of trust or with disarmament. I insist on the position that we must start with the main aspect, that is, with disarmament, we must destroy weapons, establish supervision, so that no one can arm themselves. This will create the best conditions for genuine trust and friendly relations between the peoples of all countries.

    Now I want to talk about the time to build trust. If we take a period of 5-10 years and propose such a period, it even goes against the arguments of those Western groups, because they also say that we must accelerate the conclusion of an agreement on disarmament. Because the longer the agreement is delayed, the more countries will possess atomic weapons and rocket technology each year. If more countries are armed with atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and rockets, then it will be more difficult to reach an agreement on disarmament. It seems that according to this logic of the West, we must accelerate disarmament, but Mr. Macmillan says that we must wait 5-10 years. This means that we should now make these negotiations fruitless. The result is: I, as a grandfather, start this negotiation, and this negotiation will be concluded by my grandchildren! ? (laughter in the audience) This is a chain reaction that the whole of humanity will pay for.

    It should be said that I have many grandchildren, and I hope that my grandchildren will inherit the legacy of their grandfather, and I, as a grandfather, always want to strive to make my grandchildren live in peaceful conditions, and they will thank us for defending peace.

    Chairman: The following two questions are similar, so I decided to tell you about them together.

    "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Newman asked: If the United Nations, according to the principle of majority vote (2/3), decides whether Mr. Hammarskjöld should continue to serve as Secretary-General of the United Nations, and makes a resolution on your proposal for a three-person executive body, can you agree with the voting result?

    "Express" reporter Toran asked: Mr. Chairman, you said in your speech at the United Nations General Assembly meeting on Monday that if the Secretary-General does not resign, you will draw the necessary conclusions from the current situation. Mr. Hammarskjöld replied that he would not resign from his position. Can you talk about what conclusions you have drawn or intend to draw?

    Khrushchev: These two questions are of the same nature, but they are not similar.

    First, let's talk about Mr. Hammarskjöld's statement that he will not give up the position he occupies. You have heard that I said in my speech that if Mr. Hammarskjöld had a chivalrous character, he should give up the position he occupies. However, I do not believe that he has such a character, and in this regard, Mr. Hammarskjöld has completely confirmed my view of him.

    Now let's talk about solving the problem with a two-thirds majority.

    If such a decision you mentioned is passed with a two-thirds majority, if even such a decision is passed with a 99% majority, we will still disagree with such a decision.

    The principle of majority rule of two-thirds that you use to resolve disputes is completely acceptable when resolving internal problems - political, economic, and other problems - within a country. But here we are dealing with complex international issues. This problem is solved by the member states of the United Nations. You must know that this is not a parliament, but an international forum, which was established to solve problems in such a way that the solution of the problem does not harm any member state of this forum.

    If you want, I will raise this issue even more frankly. You can imagine if the representatives of the member states of the United Nations have a flash of inspiration and come up with such a "perfect" idea: let's eliminate the socialist system in the Soviet Union. What would happen if everyone except the representatives of our socialist countries voted in favor of this? What would we say about this situation? As we Russians often say in this case: we would say: "Get lost! You have made such a decision, live with this decision, and we have lived and will live in our own socialist system. Whoever interferes, then sorry for this rude behavior, to put it figuratively, give him a slap in the face!"

    Gentlemen, a very serious issue is raised here. Therefore, I would like to talk about this issue. I ask you to think carefully about this issue. In the United Nations, which is composed of imperialist countries, socialist countries, and neutral countries, the imperialist and colonialist group of countries still controls the majority of votes for the time being. We socialist countries are currently in the minority in the United Nations. However, this situation will change: today we are in the minority, but we predict to you that tomorrow you will be in the minority. Therefore, you should not misuse the temporary majority in the United Nations to impose your decisions on the minority. I repeat, because this is not a parliament. We are not discussing the domestic issues of a certain country here, but discussing international issues under the conditions of respecting sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. This must be taken into account and based on this. Only in this way can the problem be solved correctly.

    In addition, I ask you to seriously consider our proposal on the structure of the United Nations. We do not demand that we get such a position that we occupy the same number of seats as the Western countries in the Security Council and the United Nations Secretariat today. We do not demand a majority, we only demand our share.

    There are three billion people in the world. The socialist countries have a population of more than one billion, that is, more than one-third. However, we are not stingy people, we will not haggle over every penny. We agree to one-third. The imperialist and colonialist countries have a population of less than one-third, but we also say to them: also give you one-third. The neutral countries have a population of more than one-third, and we say to them - also give them one-third.

    In this way, in the United Nations (and this is an international organization), all three categories of countries will have representatives. Capitalist countries - this is the country of monopoly capital, colonialist countries, socialist countries - this is the country of the truly free world, the freest country; and neutral countries. They all have their share, their one-third. This will create equal conditions for all three categories of countries. In this way, international issues will be solved in such a way that no category of countries will be harmed. Isn't this wise?

    We are not asking for privileges, but our share that we deserve.

    If you want to force us to submit to you with a majority and force us to solve certain problems under unequal conditions, then you are forcing us to defend our interests not through voting in the United Nations, but outside the United Nations, that is, relying on our own military strength and our own strength to defend our interests. And doing so, as you all know, will worsen relations.

    A wise foundation is laid in our proposal. We want to ease international tensions, we want peaceful coexistence, we want peace and friendship. But you insist on ruling us, ruling the socialist countries and neutral countries, that is, you insist on continuing the "Cold War" and intensifying the position of mutual relations. Think about this carefully, gentlemen! If you don't think about it carefully today and misunderstand it, I hope you can understand it tomorrow, because there is no other way out.

    The problem is posed like this: either we develop our relations by eliminating international tensions and the "Cold War," striving for peace and friendship; or we continue to implement the policy of intensifying relations and end up with a fate that only God knows, because any intensification of tensions and the "Cold War" will develop into a hot war.

    Whoever wants to maintain peace and friendship between countries should not only take into account the interests of his own country and his own group of countries, but also take into account the interests of the socialist countries and neutral countries.

    We do not want to force you to accept our socialist system. You can live as you wish, but do not interfere with us also living as we wish. We do not interfere with the neutral countries, let them live as they wish.

    We do not want to sacrifice the interests of other countries to seek anything for ourselves. We just hope that all countries are equal, and we hope that we will work together for the common cause - to ensure world peace.

    Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reporter Burke asked: You said that the main purpose of the Western countries in the Congo is to continue to control the raw materials produced there, especially uranium. Considering that uranium, the main product of Katanga, is available in extremely large quantities in the world, and that, for example, some huge uranium mines have been closed in Canada, what is the basis for your statement?

    Khrushchev: Sir, you want to impose your understanding on me, that is: colonialists plunder colonies and kill people in order to end their dying breath in this world faster and ascend to heaven faster. (audience lively)

    For me, it is completely secondary whether the colonialists go there to get uranium, to get cobalt, or to get ghosts, to get yakshas. They go to plunder the colonial people, to make a fortune from them, and to eliminate the people of the enslaved countries. When the Belgian colonialists went to the Congo, there were more than 20 million people there, and now, when the colonialists have stayed there for many years and left, the population has not only not increased, but has decreased by almost half. Why? Do black people have fewer children? No, they may even have more children than Europeans. But they are in unbelievable, inhumane conditions, so their children cannot survive - they die, and those who do not die in childhood do not live long; their life expectancy is different from that of people living in normal conditions. Or take the Australians. Mr. Menzies made a speech at the United Nations General Assembly. He could have talked about how Australia was conquered, how the colonialists poisoned and destroyed children there like beasts. They almost wiped out all the indigenous people. And this is called "civilization"! People will remember this civilization, and hatred for the enslavers will continue for generations.

    We oppose the policy of the colonialists. We protest against this policy with indignation and will do everything we can to make this cursed, outdated, enslaving colonial system perish faster, so that all the peoples of all countries can gain free independence.

    CBS reporter Hotlett asked:

    What do you think you have achieved in New York, within the United Nations, and outside the United Nations?

    Khrushchev: Loggers measure the quality and quantity of their labor with a certain yardstick. In the past, Russians used sand ropes to measure, but now they are gone. I used to be a fitter, and I have a certain estimate of my labor. My father was a miner, and he also had his standards. Now I have become a political activist. I am not a logger. More precisely, I am also a logger, but at the same time a politician. It seems impossible to measure the quantity and quality of my labor during my short stay at the United Nations with any yardstick. I can say one thing - whoever thinks our labor is in vain does not understand what is happening.

    We have sown the seeds of kindness, the seeds of peace and friendship, exposed lies, and sown the seeds of truth here. And now, no matter how loudly someone shouts, and to suppress the voice of truth, his voice is always not loud enough. Truth cannot be suppressed! Truth will eventually triumph. It takes patience to know when it will triumph.

    We do not stop the struggle for truth, we have started this struggle, and we will continue it. Victory will belong to us. Please remember: the reason why truth will triumph is that lies cannot last long; no matter what makeup it wears, people will always understand lies, no matter how beautiful the photographer, cinematographer, reporter, and artist make it, the true face of lies will eventually be revealed and cause people to be disgusted, and truth will penetrate people's hearts. Truth belongs to us. Truth will surely triumph! (applause)

    Tunisian Radio reporter Moule asked:

    Here in New York, and other Soviet leaders in Moscow, have had formal talks with the leaders of the Algerian Provisional Government. This is interpreted as the Soviet Union de facto recognizing the Algerian government.

    Would you like to talk about this, for example, to tell us what kind of assistance you plan to give to the Algerian people in their struggle for independence?

    Khrushchev: You understand correctly, it can be seen from our meeting and talks that we have actually recognized the Algerian Provisional Government. I think that not only we recognize it, but many countries in the world recognize it, and the first to recognize it is French President De Gaulle, who is negotiating with the representatives of this Algerian Provisional Government.

    I answered this kind of question some time ago, when I said that we Soviet people sympathize with all colonial people who oppose colonialists and strive for their own independence. How can we exclude such a great people as the Arab people who are fighting for their independence and freedom? We welcome their struggle. We have given and will give all the help we can in the past and in the future, and this help will be beneficial to the Algerian people in their struggle for their independence and freedom.

    "Unity" reporter Ferrer asked: What do you think of the proposal to vote on the proposals of the five neutral countries?

    Khrushchev: We expressed our attitude towards this proposal in my letter to the drafters of the proposal, and this attitude has been published. I don't think there is any need to talk about this issue now.

    "World News Agency" reporter Fletcher asked: In view of the Soviet Union's vigorous call for the development of underdeveloped countries, will it increase payments within the scope of the United Nations aid program, as the United States has promised to do?

    Khrushchev: I have talked about this issue more than once. We participate in aid to underdeveloped countries through the United Nations, but we believe that it is best to remain at the original level of aid given through the United Nations until a disarmament agreement is reached.

    After the disarmament agreement is reached, it will be entirely possible to save funds as a result of disarmament, that is, we can increase aid to underdeveloped countries in consultation with other countries. However, we believe that it is best to provide aid mainly on a bilateral basis, that is, to reach agreements with underdeveloped countries and provide them with selfless aid on the basis of this agreement.

    As for mentioning President Eisenhower's statement on aid, I think now that even if one-tenth of what the imperialist countries have plundered from underdeveloped countries is returned - they plunder underdeveloped countries to the last thread - even if one-tenth of the things are returned to these countries, it is too little. And I do not expect the aid provided by the imperialist countries to increase. You must know that it is one thing to talk about it, and it is another thing to do it. Capitalism will only plunder, it will not provide real aid, because this is contrary to the essence of capitalism.

    Therefore, gentlemen of the press, you must be good at reading people's speeches, and you must also be good at understanding what you read. I tell you this because life experience tells me so. Take Britain as an example. How rich is this country, and how poor is India! How rich is France, and how poor are the African countries plundered by France. How rich is Britain, and how poor is Ceylon.

    Is poverty the national essence of these countries? No. This is a social phenomenon, this is a political phenomenon. The plunderers came, plundered the people of the enslaved countries, and then said - thank us for our plunder, because we have brought you civilization. Look, our saying there is like this - God save me from such a friend, and I can deal with the enemy myself. It should also be said here: God save me from this kind of civilization, we can undoubtedly deal with this kind of civilization ourselves, and we will definitely conquer this kind of civilization!

    In addition, when the British enslaved India, India's level was relatively high. Britain relied not on civilization, but on the power of plunderers, the power of the strong. This is the so-called right! And now they want to put on a noble face. This... it seems that this is enough. (!) (laughter in the audience)

    AFP reporter Cecebourg asked: The Chinese Communist Party newspaper "People's Daily" supports the view that as long as capitalist society exists, war is inevitable, and the atomic bomb is just a "paper tiger." Would you like to comment on this view!

    Khrushchev: I have not read this newspaper. You have read it, but you ask me to comment! Can you represent my position? You have read it, so you should comment on it, and I will comment on it after I have read it. (laughter in the audience)

    South Korean Tonghwa News Agency reporter asked:

    Mr. Chairman, can you tell us something about your planned visit to North Korea. What is your purpose in visiting there now? (laughter)

    Khrushchev: Gentlemen, I don't understand why you are so happy about the question raised by the reporter. This is probably because this gentleman is from South Korea. I don't see the reason for your happiness. I have great respect for this gentleman's question.

    You know that there used to be Syngman Rhee in South Korea. We opposed him and his regime. Now he is no longer there, and his regime no longer exists, although the current regime in South Korea is no different from the previous one. However, although this year is this regime and tomorrow is another regime, the Korean people still exist, therefore, we believe in the good beginnings formed in every nation, including the Korean people. The Korean people are freedom-loving people, and they heroically opposed the Japanese occupation. However, people in the southern part of the country are in a worse situation than in the north. North Koreans are in a better situation than South Koreans, whether from a geographical point of view or from a political point of view, but we are convinced that the people of South Korea also yearn for North Korea.

    You asked me when I will go to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea? Now I am consulting with Comrade Kim Il-sung on when we can go to Korea, because I was delayed in the United States. This issue will be announced later.

    South Korean reporter, I hope that through you, I can convey my best wishes to the South Korean people, if you dare to convey my good wishes. We hope that the socio-political system in South Korea will be decided by the Korean people themselves, and we hope that the South Korean people will gain independence and complete freedom, so that all the Korean people can become the masters of their own destiny and wealth. (applause)

    Washington "Star" reporter Boyd and other reporters asked:

    Does the Soviet Union have any suggestions for the active work of the United Nations Committee on Outer Space?

    Khrushchev: We have stated our suggestions in the past, and we are ready to participate in this committee if our wishes are taken into account. We believe that the US proposal is one-sided, and the United States has not taken into account the interests of the socialist countries, but is trying to issue orders in this committee. If you don't want to issue orders in this committee, but want to issue orders in outer space, then please issue orders, there is enough space for everyone there. You issue orders, and we will also issue orders. (laughter in the audience)

    "New York Times" reporter Hamilton asked:

    When you talked to Mr. Macmillan, you seemed to suggest holding a summit meeting and a special session of the United Nations in early next year, after President Eisenhower's successor takes office. Can you tell us in more detail when, in your opinion, this meeting should be held? What will it discuss?

    Khrushchev: Yes, it is correct news. When I met with Mr. Macmillan (we met twice in New York), we talked about these issues in our conversation.

    Mr. Macmillan assured me that a summit meeting would be held. My attitude is the same as what we stated at the time: we advocate holding a summit meeting in order to resolve the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and resolving the issue of West Berlin as a free city arising therefrom. However, I also raised other issues.

    In my conversation with Mr. Macmillan, I said that perhaps we should immediately submit the issue of the peace treaty with Germany to the conference of countries that fought against Hitler's Germany and conclude a peace treaty at this conference. Whoever wants to sign, sign.

    I raised this point starting from the point of accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, because the solution of this problem has been delayed for too long. Mr. Macmillan assured me that a meeting of the heads of government of the great powers would be held, and we could talk about this issue at the meeting. If this is the case, then we will abide by what we said after the US sabotaged the Paris summit meeting in May.

    Another issue is also raised here, that is, the issue of a special session of the United Nations General Assembly. I did raise such an issue in my conversation with Mr. Macmillan. Mr. Macmillan did not deny the benefits of holding such a meeting. I have stated this issue to you.

    We have always believed that the issue of disarmament is the issue among issues. It seems that in the current General Assembly, there are no special conditions for achieving beneficial results on this issue. First of all, we must consider that the discussion of this issue in the United Nations coincides with the peak of the US presidential election campaign. It seems that in this case, the United States cannot actively participate in the discussion of this extremely important issue now. This is one reason.

    Secondly, some people argue for this, saying that there are many issues that require discussion at the plenary session of the General Assembly.

    We have always believed that the issue of disarmament is the primary task, an issue that overrides all other issues. Therefore, if we take into account the above-mentioned views, then it seems beneficial to convene a special session of the UN General Assembly and only discuss the issue of reaching an agreement on disarmament and establishing international supervision over disarmament at this meeting.

    I have talked to not only Mr. Macmillan, but also other national leaders about this issue.

    When is it suitable to hold a meeting? I think it can be held in February or March. Some people say that it can be held in April, and they feel that it is more suitable. It would be very good to convene such a meeting in Europe. 80% of countries are geographically inclined to Europe in terms of their geographical location. Therefore, we believe that it is better to convene a special meeting in Geneva. However, if the participants of the meeting are willing to hold the meeting in the Soviet Union and give us this honor, we would be happy to arrange the meeting in Moscow or Leningrad. There, the most normal conditions will be created for the work of the meeting.

    I believe that all those who truly hope to reach a disarmament agreement and ensure peace (all people should hope so) will sympathize with us and should promote such a decision.

    UPI reporter Shapino asked: Will the status quo of Berlin be maintained before the next summit meeting?

    Khrushchev: The question is raised too abstractly. First of all, will a summit meeting be held? If the question is raised like Mr. Shapino, then it will be concluded that I should guarantee to maintain the status quo, but I don't know when the meeting will be held? This means that the state of no peace treaty with Germany will be maintained forever. If the understanding of this issue is the same as my understanding, that is, a summit meeting will be held after the presidential election, then we will strictly abide by our promise. If we see that there is no desire to hold a summit meeting, then the countries that advocate the conclusion of a peace treaty must eventually meet and sign a peace treaty. At that time, the occupation system of West Berlin will end.

    Chairman: I would like to end with a question that does not fall within the scope of politics, a question raised by Mr. Mere of the "Irish Times."

    Can you say with certainty that you will send people into Earth orbit this year?

    Khrushchev: Do you want to register as the first candidate? (laughter in the audience)

    Reporter: With you.

    Khrushchev: I am not suitable in terms of age and weight. (laughter in the audience)

    Reporter: Me neither.

    Khrushchev: I don't know you, so I said that. I don't want to blame you, and there is nothing to blame here. I can only tell you one thing, we have many people who want to fly into space, and they are stepping up preparations. Everyone hopes to give him the honor of the first flight.

    We believe that this flight is very important and has great scientific significance. Therefore, the sports method is not suitable here. To say what date, a certain day will send people to space is to treat this extremely important issue in the way of sports. We cannot set ourselves such a task. Only after the corresponding flight conditions have been prepared for people can we send people to space, because this is a question of protecting the life of a person flying to space. When this can be done, I cannot say, because this is primarily a matter for scientists. Sending people to space does not require wisdom now, and the most important thing is the issue of returning people.

    I heard the respected Chairman say that this question is the last one, so please let me say the last few words as well.

    First of all, I would like to thank our respected Chairman - the Chairman of the United Nations Correspondents Association, and thank you all for letting me and my friends have a good meal. (audience cheers) You have the right to make evaluations, but in any case, I always try to faithfully compensate you for your bread and salt. (laughter, applause) I would also like to thank all the gentlemen, friends, and comrades for their kindness, and I wish you success in your work.

    Let us work together to fight for peace. I am a communist. If I say that there are other communists besides me here, I am not leaking secrets. I saw them, they are here. (cheers) However, the majority of those present are not communists. However, there is one point that we should come together, that is, we are all human, and everyone living on Earth wants to live life. I repeat, let us unite our strength in one issue, in the struggle for peace. The issue of social and political structure is the internal affair of the people of each country, and the cause of world peace is the common cause of the people of all countries.

    Let us focus on striving to achieve the common goal - to ensure peace on Earth. And in order to ensure peace on Earth and prevent any accidents from happening, countries must reach an agreement on disarmament. Gentlemen, if we do this, then I believe that we will be remembered forever. Our descendants will say: our fathers and grandfathers were not so stupid, although they did not get along well with each other and had many disputes, they understood the main thing - they did not allow war and preserved peace.

    This is enough for every conscientious person, and he can feel at ease. (applause)

    赫鲁晓夫在联合国记者协会宴会上答记者问
    新华社10日讯　塔斯社纽约8日讯：苏联部长会议主席随行新闻组报道：
    联合国记者协会10月7日举行宴会，招待出席联合国大会第十五届会议的苏联代表团团长、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫。
    协会主席山德斯先生代表协会会员热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫，感谢他同意同驻在联合国的记者们会晤。山德斯说：
    主席先生
    当我们向“波罗的海号”，向您发出我们的邀请时，我们还没有预见到，在您到达这里后，您会为此慨然允诺同意举行记者招待会。我们错误地以为，您接受我们的邀请，将会给我们造成某种优势。现在，我们看到，这可能被解释为是特殊的垄断，而您对于垄断一向是肯定不会给予同意的。
    我应当说，您同报界的交往只能说是最民主的。
    我得到机会在联大开会的几周期间观察您，听取有关您的许多谈论。我认为，新闻和您有某种共同之处。有人说，您是一个激动的人。但是，主席先生，激动对我们来讲是消息来源。作为一个人，我们是有感情的，无论我们如何尽力做到客观。您像我们一样，喜欢“抛头露面”，为此我们喜欢您。
    但是，我们最了解您是一位共处思想的伟大宣传家。我们很高兴在我们——把共处思想变成活生生的现实的人们——中间欢迎您。我们代表不同的国家，而我们的履历也是不同的。我们持有不同的政治信仰。我们在报纸和杂志上写文章，或为代表各方面最广泛的舆论的电台工作。但是，在我们中间却充满着不能再好的友好精神。我们没有在可能使我们发生分歧的问题上争论，如果紧急会议和晚间会议不很多，那么我们就往往讨论我们之间的各种问题，试图弄清楚，这些困难的原因是什么。因此，您看到，共处对我们来说不是一个问题，虽然它对世界可能是一个很困难的问题。
    但是，我们简直不知道，您以及其他人能否在把共处思想体现到生活中去，体现到全世界范围的生活中去的事业中取得成就，以及您怎样达到这一点。我们希望您会把这个问题同其他问题一并解释给我们。
    最后，我想用俄语说，如果我的发音不是那么糟糕的话：“欢迎”。
    诸位先生，我现在把尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫主席先生介绍给你们。
    接着，赫鲁晓夫讲话。
    赫鲁晓夫在热烈的掌声中说：
    协会主席先生！尊敬的先生们，同志们，朋友们！
    我很高兴同你们，报道联合国工作的记者们会见。我经常有机会同记者们见面。你们的职业是艰难的，然而是崇高的。报刊可以帮助人民正确地理解复杂的现代世界中发生的一切事情。但是，报刊也可能使人民迷失方向，如果它被用来达到某些集团的自私目的的话。
    最近以来你们有许多工作。联合国大会第十五届会议是自联合国成立以来最有意义的一次会议。这次会议要讨论的是裁军和彻底消除可耻的殖民主义制度这样一些极其重要的国际问题。我们认为顺利地和一致地解决这些问题是有着特殊意义的。裁军对各国都有利害关系，因为只有这样才能避免新的毁灭性的战争。
    我没有必要向你们表明，这些问题同其他问题一样，只要具有诚意，愿意使各国在和平共处和放弃侵略行动原则的基础上实行合作并遵守国际法准则，那是可以解决的。
    在目前情况下，企图借助联合国中的机械多数把这样或那样的决议加强在另外一些国家的身上，这是荒谬的。必须使联合国能考虑到现存的所有国家集团的利益，既考虑到组成西方军事集团的国家的利益，也考虑到社会主义国家和中立国家的利益。建立相应结构的联合国工作机构，会有助于改进联合国的工作。
    我呼吁你们全体都能运用笔的力量、你们的能力和你们的影响来创造有助于联合国活动的局势，呼吁你们真实地写。让千百万你们的读者面前有一幅现代世界和我们大家面临的问题的真实和实现的图景。
    “全国广播公司”女记者佛雷德里克问：
    主席先生！您是否认为，在美国和苏联之间的分歧还没有缓和，顾虑和不信任还没有消除以前，有没有什么在裁军方面取得进展的希望？
    赫鲁晓夫：我认为，如果放弃对可能达成裁军协议的希望，这就意味着使世界注定发生新战争，意味着签字承认那些应当考虑和平和创造和平共处条件的人没有力量。因此，我现在也是乐观地看待达成裁军协议的可能性，并且不止一次地说，这种条件是存在的。
    很难断定现在这些条件成熟到什么样的程度，因为本届联大会议碰上了美国人民生活中的“风暴时期”。我指的是总统竞选。在美国所有的人现在都忙于这件事，一切都服从这一点，那些同解决裁军问题有关的人士现在考虑的只是哪个候选人将当选为总统。这是一种可悲的现象，因为总统可以是这个人士或那个人士，这对国际问题没有决定性的作用，因为这是一个国家内部的问题。由于现在在美国一切都服从于竞选，我们就应当考虑这一点。但是这是暂时的现象。
    我想在这方面再阐述一个问题。我想更正一个消息，就是美国报纸上刊登的关于我同麦克米伦先生会见的消息。报纸上关于我同英国首相麦克米伦会见和谈话的结果报道得不完全确切。
    我们的确就裁军问题，就这个问题达成协议的可能性问题进行了会谈。麦克米伦先生说，不必急于解决这个问题，应该等到为各国之间信任创造了更好条件的时候。那时候也就可以就裁军问题达成协议了。麦克米伦先生认为，为了创造信任的气氛，可能大约要经过五年到十年，目前最好是建立某种技术专家委员会，来研究这些问题。总而言之，他建议慢慢推进，就像许多昆虫、蜗牛和其他不很灵活的机体在地面上爬行一样。
    我们认为，必须尽一切努力来保障和平，不要扠起双手，而是继续为和平共处、为裁军、为保障全世界的巩固和平而顽强斗争。但是，在争取巩固和平的斗争中主要的有一点，就是裁军，而不是美国总统艾森豪威尔先生所建议实行的对军备的监督。我再说一遍，尽管关于这点我已经重复好多遍了，可是我还要重复，一直到所有的人都明白为止：裁军、销毁武器是避免战争的唯一的方法，而对军备的监督就是保存武器。如果保存着武器，那怕是在监督之下，拥有武器的人也总是能够在他愿意的时候利用武器来达到侵略目的。因此，谁真正要和平，谁就应当不是为了对军备的监督而斗争，而是应当为了裁军、为了在最严格的广泛而深入的国际监督下销毁武器而斗争。
    如果像某些人所作的那样，使裁军问题依赖于国际紧张局势的缓和和信任的确立，那么我告诉你们，这样提出问题是很危险的。这等于是争论先有鸡还是先有蛋的问题（场内笑声）。我看，究竟是先有鸡还是先有蛋，这个问题到现在还没有解决。因此，在达成裁军协议的问题上关于从哪里开始、从创造信任条件开始或者从裁军开始，这样来谈是不会有结果的。我坚持这样的立场：必须从主要方面，即是从裁军开始，必须销毁武器，建立监督，使谁也不能武装起来。从而为各国人民之间真诚的信任和亲睦关系创造最良好的条件。
    现在我想谈谈建立信任的时间。如果以5—10年为期，提出这样的时期，甚至违背那些西方集团的主张，因为他们也说，必须加速达成关于裁军的协定。因为达成协议拖延得越久，拥有原子武器和火箭技术的国家数目就将逐年增多。如果用原子弹、氢弹和火箭武装起来的国家增多，那么，达成关于裁军的协议就将有更大的困难。看来，根据西方的这个逻辑，必须加速裁军，但是麦克米伦先生说，必须等待5—10年。这就是说，我们现在应当使这种谈判没有成果。结果是：我作祖父的开始这个谈判，而这个谈判要由我的孙子来结束！？（场内笑声）这是一种全人类都要付出代价的连锁反应。
    应该说，我的孙子很多，并且我希望我的孙子们继承祖父的遗志，而我当祖父的，总想努力使孙子们生活在和平的条件下，他们会因为我们保卫和平而感谢我们的。
    主席：以下两个问题相类似，因此我决定一起谈给您听。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”记者纽曼问：如果联合国根据多数票（2／3）的原则来进行表决，决定哈马舍尔德先生是否仍担任联合国秘书长的职务这一问题，和就您的关于三人执行机构的建议作出决议，其表决结果，您能同意吗？
    “快报”记者托伦问：主席先生，您在星期一联合国大会会议上讲话中说，如果秘书长不辞职的话，您将从现在的情况中作出必要的结论。哈马舍尔德先生回答说，他不辞去自己的职务。您能否谈一谈，您已经作出怎样的结论或者打算作出怎样的结论？
    赫鲁晓夫：这两个问题是同样性质的，但是它们并不是相似的。
    先谈哈马舍尔德先生说他不放弃所占据的职位的谈话。你们已经听到过，我在自己的讲话中曾说：如果哈马舍尔德先生具有侠义性格的话，他就应当放弃所占据的职位。但是，我不相信他具有这样的性格，在这方面哈马舍尔德先生完全证实了我对他的看法。
    现在谈谈以三分之二的多数解决问题。
    如果以三分之二的票数通过了你们所说的这种决定，如果甚至以99％的多数通过这种决定，我们也仍然是不同意这种决定。
    在解决争执问题时你们用三分之二来决定的多数制原则，在一个国家内部解决内部问题——政治、经济和其他问题时是完全可以接受的。但是，在这里我们是处理复杂的国际问题。这个问题是由联合国会员国来解决的。要知道，这不是议会，而是国际场所，它的成立是为了这样地解决问题，即使问题的解决不损害这个场所的任何一个成员国。
    如果你们愿意，我将更无隐讳地提出这个问题。你们可以设想，如果联合国会员国的代表念头一动，产生这样一个“完美的”想法：让我们来消灭苏联的社会主义制度。如果除了我们社会主义国家的代表外，大家都投票赞成这个，那会是怎样呢？我们对这种情况怎么说呢？正如我们俄罗斯人在这种情况下常说的：我们会说：“滚吧！你们作出了这样的决定，让你们同这个决定生活在一起吧，而我们过去和将来都生活在自己的社会主义制度里。谁干涉，那么对不起他这种无礼行为，打个比喻说，给他一个嘴巴！”
    诸位先生，这里提出了一个十分严肃的问题。因此，我还想就这个问题谈一下。我请你们仔细思索一下这个问题。在由帝国主义国家、社会主义国家和中立国家组成的联合国里，现在帝国主义和殖民主义集团的国家暂时还操纵着多数票。我们社会主义国家今天在联合国中是少数。但是，这种情况是会改变的：今天我们是少数，可是，我们预告你们，明天你们将是少数。所以，你们不应当乱用在联合国中暂时的多数把自己的决议强加给少数。我再说一遍，因为这不是议会。我们在这里不是讨论某一国家的国内问题，而是在尊重主权和不干涉他国内政的条件下讨论国际问题。必须考虑到这一点并以此为根据。这样才会使问题得到正确的解决。
    另外，我请你们认真地思索一下我们关于联合国结构的建议。我们不要求使自己得到这样的地位，即今天在安理会和联合国秘书处中占有同西方国家数量均等的席位。我们不要求多数，只要求自己的一份。
    世界上有三十亿人口。社会主义国家有人口十亿以上，也就是三分之一以上。但是，我们不是小气的人，我们不会斤斤计较。我们同意三分之一。帝国主义、殖民主义国家的人口不到三分之一，但是我们也对他们说：也给你们三分之一。中立国家人口三分之一以上，我们对他们说——也给他们三分之一。
    这样，在联合国（而这是个国际组织）中，所有的三类国家就都有了代表。资本主义国家——这是垄断资本的国家，殖民主义国家，社会主义国家——这是真正自由世界的国家，最自由的国家；和中立国家。它们全都有自己的一份、有自己的三分之一。从而为所有的三类国家创造平等的条件。这样，就会使国际问题这样地得到解决：这种解决要不致使任何一类国家受到损害。难道这不是明智的吗？
    我们要求的不是特权，而是我们理应占有的一份。
    如果你们要以多数使我们屈从于你们和强迫我们在不平等的条件下解决某些问题的话，那么，你们就是强迫我们不是在联合国通过表决的方式捍卫自己的利益，而是在联合国以外，也就是说，依靠自己的武力和自己的实力来捍卫自己的利益。而这样做，你们都了解，将会使关系恶化。
    在我们的建议中奠定了一个明智的基础。我们想缓和国际紧张局势，我们愿意和平共处，愿意和平与友谊。你们却硬想统治我们，统治社会主义国家和中立国家，也就是说，你们坚持继续“冷战”和加剧相互关系的立场。你们好好想想这一点吧，先生们！如果你们今天不好好想和理解错了，我希望你们在明天能够理解，因为别的出路是没有的。
    问题是这样摆着：要么我们通过消除国际紧张局势和“冷战”的道路来发展我们的关系，力求和平与友谊；要么我们继续执行加剧关系的方针，落得个只有上帝知道的下场，因为紧张局势和“冷战”的任何加剧都会发展成为热战。
    谁愿意各国之间保持和平与友谊，谁就应该不仅考虑到本国和自己国家集团的利益，而且也应该考虑到社会主义国家和中立国家的利益。
    我们并不想强迫你们接受我们的社会主义制度。你们可以随你们的心愿去生活，但是不要干涉我们也按照我们的心愿去生活。我们不要干涉中立国家，让他们按照他们的心愿去生活吧。
    我们不想牺牲别国的利益来为自己求得什么。我们只是希望一切国家一律平等，我们希望今后为了共同的事业——保障世界和平而努力。
    加拿大广播电台记者伯克问：您说过，西方国家在刚果的主要目的是要继续控制那里生产的原料、尤其是铀。如果考虑到，铀，这个加丹加的主要产品在世界上有极大的数量，以及比如在加拿大关闭了一些巨大的铀矿，那么您的这句话有什么根据呢？
    赫鲁晓夫：先生，您想把自己的理解强加于我，那就是：殖民主义者掠夺殖民地和杀人，是为了使他们更快地结束在这个世界上的奄奄一息和更快地升入天堂。（场内活跃）
    对我来说，殖民主义者到那里去是为了搞铀，为了搞钴，还是去搞鬼，搞夜叉，这完全是次要问题。他们去是为了掠夺殖民地人民，靠他们发财，并消灭被奴役国家的人民。当比利时殖民主义者到刚果去的时候，那里有两千多万人口，而现在，当殖民主义者在那里呆了好多年以后走了的时候，人口不但没有增加，反而减少了差不多二分之一。为什么？难道黑人生的孩子少吗？不是，他们生的孩子甚至可能比欧洲人多。但是他们处在难以置信的、非人的条件下，因而，他们的孩子活不了，——他们死去了，而那些在童年时期没有死去的人也活不长；他们的寿命同生活在正常的条件下的人不同。或者拿澳大利亚人来说吧。孟席斯先生在联合国大会上发了言。他本来可以谈谈澳大利亚是怎样被征服的，殖民主义者怎样在那里像对待野兽那样毒死和摧毁孩子。他们几乎消灭了所有土著居民。而这叫做“文明”！人们会记住这种文明的，对奴役者的仇恨将世世代代继续下去。
    我们反对殖民主义者的政策。我们义愤填膺地抗议这种政策，并将尽我们所能尽的一切努力，使这种可诅咒的、过时的、奴役人的殖民主义制度更快地灭亡，以便使所有各国人民都能得到自由的独立。
    哥伦比亚广播公司记者霍特莱特问：
    您认为您在纽约，在联合国内和在联合国外，都取得了些什么呢？
    赫鲁晓夫：樵夫测量他的劳动的质量和数量是有一定尺度的。过去俄国人用沙绳来量，现在没有了。过去我做过钳工，我对我的劳动有一定的估量。我的父亲是矿工，他也有他的标准。现在我成了政治活动家。我不是樵夫。更正确地说，我也是樵夫，但同时又是政治家。要用某种尺度来衡量在联合国短短的逗留期间我的劳动的数量和质量，看来是不可能的。我可以说一点——谁要是认为我们的劳动是白费，那他就是不理解发生的一切。
    我们在这里播下了善良的种子，和平和友谊的种子，揭穿了谎言并播下了真理的种子。而现在，不论有谁多么大声地叫喊，而要把真理的声音压下去，他的声音总是不够大的。真理是扼杀不了的！真理终将胜利。它究竟什么时候取得胜利，这需要有耐心。
    我们不停止争取真理的斗争，我们开始了这一斗争，而且要把它继续下去。胜利将属于我们。请你们记住：真理之所以将胜利是因为谎言不能久存；它不论经过什么化妆，人们总会明白谎言的，不论摄影师、电影摄影师、记者和艺术家把它弄得多好看，谎言的真面目终会露出来并引起人们的厌恶，而真理将深入人心。真理是属于我们的。真理一定胜利！（掌声）
    突尼斯电台记者穆莱勒问：
    您在这里，在纽约，以及苏联的其他领导人在莫斯科，都同阿尔及利亚临时政府的领导人进行了正式的交谈。这被人们解释为，苏联事实上承认了阿尔及利亚政府。
    您是否愿意谈谈这一点，譬如说告诉我们，您打算在阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争中给予他们怎样的援助？
    赫鲁晓夫：您理解对了，从我们的会见和交谈中可以看出，我们实际上是承认阿尔及利亚临时政府的。我认为，不仅我们承认它，而且世界上许多国家都承认它，而承认它的首先是同这个阿尔及利亚临时政府的代表进行谈判的法国总统戴高乐。
    我在前些时候就回答过这一类的问题，当时我说，我们苏联人同情所有反对殖民主义者、争取自己独立的殖民地人民。我们怎能把争取自己独立和自由的阿拉伯人民这样伟大的人民排除在外呢？我们欢迎他们的斗争。我们在过去和将来都给予我们力所能及的全力帮助，这种帮助对阿尔及利亚人民在他们争取自己独立和自由的斗争中将是有益的。
    “团结报”记者费勒尔问：您对表决五个中立国的提案的看法怎样？
    赫鲁晓夫：我们在我给提案起草人的信中表示了我们对这一提案的态度，这种态度已经发表了。我认为，现在未必需要再谈这个问题。
    “世界新闻社”记者弗莱彻问：鉴于苏联大力呼吁发展不发达的国家，它是否将在联合国援助计划范围内增加支付，就像美国答应要做到的那样？
    赫鲁晓夫：对这个问题我谈过不止一次了。我们参加通过联合国对不发达国家的援助，但是，我们认为，在没有达成裁军协议以前，最好是停留在通过联合国给予援助的原有水平上。
    裁军协议达成后，由于裁军的结果，将完全有可能把资金节省下来，也就是说，我们可以根据同其他国家的协商，增加对不发达国家的援助。但是，我们认为最好主要是在双边的基础上给予援助，即同不发达的国家达成协议，并在这个协议的基础上给予它们无私的援助。
    至于提到艾森豪威尔总统关于援助的声明，现在我认为，即使把帝国主义国家在不发达国家中掠夺来的东西的十分之一还回去——它们掠夺不发达国家到一根线为止——即使把十分之一的东西还给这些国家，这也太少。而我并不指望帝国主义国家提供的援助会有所增加。要知道嘴上讲讲是一回事，做起来又是一回事。资本主义只会掠夺，它不会提供真正的援助，因为这是同资本主义的实质相矛盾的。
    记者先生们，因此，你们要善于读人的演讲词，而且也要善于理解所读到的东西。我这样对大家说是因生活经验是这样告诉我的。拿英国来做例子吧。这个国家多么富，而印度是多么穷！法国是多么富，而被法国掠夺的非洲国家是多么穷。英国是多么富，锡兰又是多么穷。
    难道贫穷是这些国家的民族本质吗？不是的。这是社会现象，这是政治现象。掠夺者来了，掠夺了被奴役国家的人民，过后还说——你们感谢我们的掠夺吧，因为我们给你们带来了文明。请看，我们那里俗语是这样说的——老天爷把我从这样的朋友那里救出来吧，而敌人我自己就可以对付。这里也应该这样说：天老爷把我从这种文明那里救出来吧，我们无疑自己能对付这种文明，并一定能征服这种文明的！
    此外，在英国人奴役印度的时候，印度的水平是比较高的。英国依仗的不是文明，而是掠夺者的力量，强者的力量。这就是所谓权利！而现在他们竟想摆出一副高尚的面孔来。这……看来这也已经够了。（！）（场内笑声）
    法新社记者策兹布格问：中国共产党机关报“人民日报”支持这样的意见：只要存在着资本主义社会，战争是不可避免的，而原子弹只是“纸老虎”。你是否愿意评述一下这种意见！
    赫鲁晓夫：我没有看过这份报。您看过了，反而叫我来评论！您能够代表我的位置吗？您看过了，那就您来评论吧，到我看了以后，我再来评论。（场内笑声）
    南朝鲜同和通讯社记者问：
    主席先生，您能否就预定访问北朝鲜一事对我们说些什么。您现在到那里去访问有何目的？（笑声）
    赫鲁晓夫：先生们，我不明白，你们为什么对记者先生所提出的问题那么欢乐。这大概是因为这位先生是来自南朝鲜的。我看不到你们那么乐的原因。我非常尊重这位先生的问题。
    你们知道，在南朝鲜曾有过李承晚。我们反对他和他的政权。现在那里没有他了，他的政权也不存在了，虽然南朝鲜现今的政权同以前没有差别。但是，虽然今年是这一个政权，明天又是另一个政权，可是朝鲜人民仍然存在，因此，我们相信包括朝鲜人民在内的每一个民族中所形成的良好的开端。朝鲜人民是爱自由的人民，他们英勇反对过日本占领。然而，在国家南部的人们却处于比北部恶劣的境遇。北部的朝鲜人无论从地理观点或从政治观点上来说，情况都比南部的人们好，但，我们深信，南朝鲜的人民也是向往北朝鲜的。
    您问我什么时候去朝鲜民主主义人民共和国？现在我正在同金日成同志磋商我们什么时候才可到朝鲜去，因为我在美国耽搁了。关于这个问题以后再宣布。
    南朝鲜记者先生，我希望通过您，向南朝鲜人民转达最良好的祝愿，如果您敢于转达我的良好祝愿的话。我们希望，南朝鲜的社会政治制度由朝鲜人民自己来决定，我们希望南朝鲜人民获得独立和完全自由，使全体朝鲜人民成为自己命运和财富的主人。（掌声）
    华盛顿“明星报”记者波伊德和其他记者问：
    苏联是否有什么关于活跃联合国宇宙空间委员会工作的建议？
    赫鲁晓夫：我们过去曾经阐述过自己的建议，如果我们的愿望得到考虑，我们准备参加这个委员会。我们认为美国的建议是片面的，美国没有考虑到社会主义国家的利益，而企图在这个委员会中发号施令。如果你们不是想在这个委员会中发号施令，而是想在宇宙中发号施令，那就请发号施令吧，那里人人有足够的位置。你们发号施令，而我们也将发号施令。（场内笑声）
    “纽约时报”记者汉密尔顿问：
    当你同麦克米伦先生交谈时，你似乎曾经建议在明年年初，在艾森豪威尔总统的继承人就职以后，召开最高级会议和联合国特别会议。你能否比较详细地告诉我们，按照您的看法，这次会晤应当在什么时候举行？它将讨论什么？
    赫鲁晓夫：是的，它是正确的消息。当我同麦克米伦先生会见时（我们在纽约曾会见两次），我们在交谈中谈到这些问题。
    麦克米伦先生向我保证，最高级会议必将举行。我的态度同我们当时所陈述的一样：我们主张举行最高级会议，为的是在那里解决关于缔结对德和约问题，解决由此而产生的西柏林作为自由城市问题。但是，我也提出了其他问题。
    在同麦克米伦先生交谈时，我说，可能我们应当把对德和约问题立即提交给对希特勒德国作战的各国和会讨论，并且在这个会上缔结和约。谁愿意签字，谁就签字。
    我提出这点，出发点是加速缔结对德和约，因为这个问题的解决已经拖延得太久了。麦克米伦先生向我保证，大国政府首脑会议必将举行，我们在会上可以谈论这个问题。如果是这样，那么我们将信守在5月美国破坏巴黎最高级会议后我们所说的话。
    在这里还提出另一个问题，即关于联合国大会特别会议问题。我在同麦克米伦先生交谈时确实提出了这样的问题。麦克米伦先生不否认举行这样会议的益处。我已经向你们陈述了这个问题。
    我们同以前一样认为，裁军问题是问题中的问题。看来，在现在举行的大会上，并不具备在这个问题上取得有益的结果的特别条件。首先，必须考虑，在联合国讨论这个问题正是碰到美国总统竞选运动高潮的时候。看来，在这种情况下，现在美国不可能积极参加这一极其重要问题的讨论。这是一个原因。
    其次，有人为此辩解，说有许多问题要求在大会全体会议上讨论。
    我们过去和现在一向认为，裁军问题是首要任务，是压倒一切其他问题的问题。因此，如果考虑到上述看法，那么，看来召开联大特别会议并在这个会议上只讨论关于达成裁军和对裁军建立国际监督的协定这一个问题，是有益的。
    就这个问题，我不仅同麦克米伦先生，而且还同其他国家领导人交谈过。
    什么时候适合举行会议呢？我认为，可以在2月或3月举行。有些人说，可以在4月，这样他们感到更适合。若在欧洲召开这样会议，是非常好的。80％的国家就其地理位置来讲在地区上都趋向于欧洲。因此，我们认为特别会议在日内瓦召开比较好。但是，如果会议参加者愿意在苏联开会，把这种荣幸给予我们，我们会满意地在莫斯科或列宁格勒安排大会。在那里会给大会的工作创造最正常的条件。
    我认为，凡是真正希望达成裁军协定和保证和平的人（所有人都应当希望这样），都会同情我们，都应当促成这样的决定。
    合众国际社记者夏庇诺问：在下次最高级会议之前，是否保持柏林现状？
    赫鲁晓夫：问题提得太抽象了。首先，是否将举行最高级会议？如果像夏庇诺先生这样提出问题，那么，就会得出结论，我应当担保维持现状，但是，不知道，何年何日举行会议？这就是说永远保留没有对德和约的状态。如果对这个问题的理解像我理解的那样，即在总统大选之后，将举行最高级会议，那么，我们将严格信守我们的诺言。如果，我们看到没有举行最高级会议的愿望，那么，主张必须缔结和约的国家终归要聚会，签订和约。那时，对西柏林的占领制度将结束。
    主席：我想以一个不属于政治范围的问题作为结束，这个问题是“爱尔兰时报”梅雷先生提出的。
    您能否肯定地说，你们今年就把人送上地球轨道？
    赫鲁晓夫：您想登记作第一个候选人吗？（场内笑声）
    记者：和您一起。
    赫鲁晓夫：无论从年龄和体重来说我都是不适合的。（场内笑声）
    记者：我也是这样。
    赫鲁晓夫：我不了解您，因此我才这样说。我不想责怪您，而且这里没有什么可责怪的。我只能告诉您一点，我们有许多人想飞往宇宙，他们正在加紧准备着。每个人都希望把第一个飞行的荣誉交给他。
    我们认为，这种飞行是很重要的，它具有很大的科学意义。因此，体育方式这里是不适合的，要说什么日期，某一天必定把人送上宇宙，那就是以体育运动的方式对待这个极其重要的问题。我们不能给自己提出这样的任务。只能在为人准备好相应的飞行条件以后，我们才能把人送上宇宙，因为这是保护一个飞往宇宙的人的生命的问题。甚么时候能做到这一点，我不能说，因为这首先是科学家的事。把人送上宇宙现在已经不需要智慧了，而最主要的是使人返回的问题。
    我听到尊敬的主席说，这个问题是最后一个，因此请也让我讲最后几句话。
    我想首先向我们尊敬的主席——联合国记者协会主席表示感谢，向诸位表示感谢，感谢你们让我和我的朋友很好地吃了一顿。（场内欢跃）你们有权利作评价，但是，不管怎样，我总是尽力忠实地补偿了你们的面包和盐的。（笑声、掌声）我还要感谢诸位先生们、朋友们、同志们的盛意，并祝你们在工作中获得成功。
    让我们共同努力为和平而奋斗。我是一个共产党员。如果我说，这里除了我之外还有其他一些共产党员，我不是泄密。我看到了他们，他们就在这里。（欢跃）但是在座的大多数都不是共产党员。然而，有一点我们是应该会合的，那就是我们大家都是人，而生活在地球上的每一个人都想过生活。我再说一遍，让我们在一个问题上，在争取和平的斗争中把力量联合起来。社会和政治结构的问题，这是每个国家人民的内政，而全世界的和平事业则是各国人民的共同事业。
    让我们集中精力争取达到共同目标——保障地球上的和平。而为了保障地球上的和平，不让发生任何意外，各国就必须就裁军达成协议。诸位先生，如果我们这样做了，那我相信，我们将流芳百世。我们的子孙将说：我们的父亲和爷爷们并非那样愚蠢，尽管他们之间相处得不好，有过许多争吵，但是他们明白了主要的东西——没有允许战争和保住了和平。
    这对每个有良心的人来说足以够了，他可以安心了。（掌声）
