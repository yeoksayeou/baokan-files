    Talking about Rheumatic Arthritis
    Fu Lianzhang
    Rheumatic arthritis is a common type of joint disease and one of the main symptoms of rheumatism. Rheumatism occurs in countries all over the world, with a higher incidence in cold and humid climates.

    The detailed causes of rheumatism are not yet fully understood. However, it is generally believed to be related to infection with a "hemolytic streptococcus," mainly based on the following facts: rheumatic patients often have diseases caused by hemolytic streptococcus, such as pharyngitis, tonsillitis, or scarlet fever, two or three weeks before developing rheumatism; if sufficient doses of antibiotics (generally penicillin) are used to thoroughly control streptococcal infection in the early stages of these diseases, the occurrence of rheumatism can be prevented. The facts mentioned above certainly indicate that the occurrence of rheumatism is related to infection with hemolytic streptococcus, but it must be pointed out that not all people infected with streptococcus develop this disease; only when the human body has a special susceptibility to this bacterial pathogen does it become pathogenic.

    Dampness, cold, lack of sunlight, and poor hygiene are usually considered important external factors for the disease, but these external factors can only promote the occurrence of rheumatism under the influence of internal factors. In capitalist societies, the broad masses of working people suffer many mental and physical torments due to cruel exploitation and oppression, and therefore have a higher incidence of the disease.

    More than two thousand years ago, the earliest existing Chinese medicine book, *The Inner Canon of Huangdi*, mentioned joint diseases called "Bi syndrome," which actually included rheumatic arthritis. At that time, a fairly detailed description of this disease was made, and it was believed that "wind," "cold," and "dampness" were important factors inducing the disease, which is consistent with modern views. This shows that traditional Chinese medicine had a fairly deep understanding of this disease more than two thousand years ago.

    Rheumatic arthritis is divided into acute and chronic types. In addition to red joints and local swelling and pain, the acute type also has symptoms such as chills, fever, and sweating. The chronic type generally has no systemic symptoms other than joint swelling and pain. A characteristic of rheumatic arthritis is that often one joint recovers just as another joint is affected, and it may recur many times, especially when the weather changes; the most commonly affected joints are the knee, elbow, ankle, wrist, and shoulder. Sometimes the small joints of the fingers or toes may also be affected. After the acute inflammation subsides, joint function can be completely restored to normal without leaving any deformities or impaired movement, which is an important distinction from another disease called "rheumatoid arthritis," the latter often leading to poor joint function or joint deformities in the later stages if not treated properly.

    In the past, the treatment of rheumatic arthritis was mostly based on symptomatic therapy, and the results were not very satisfactory. Therefore, some medical staff had the view that "chronic diseases are difficult to cure completely," and many patients also lost confidence in completely curing the disease. Since last winter, medical personnel from the First Affiliated Hospital of Beijing Medical College and other units have broken through the old concept that "chronic diseases can only be treated slowly" that has been held for many years, and proposed a "integrated rapid treatment method combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine," reversing the previous views of purely local and passively conservative treatment. They analyzed the different stages and characteristics of rheumatic arthritis, grasped the main contradictions and the relationship between various contradictions at each stage, and adopted the principle of combining the whole and the part, and combining movement and stillness. They applied traditional Chinese and Western medicine, internal and external medicine, including drugs, acupuncture, massage, hot compress, steam therapy, qigong, Taijiquan, and various gymnastics, and brought into play the subjective initiative of medical personnel and patients, mobilizing all positive factors to fight against the disease. After more than half a year of clinical practice, satisfactory results have been achieved, shortening the treatment time and greatly improving the curative effect.

    As for how each rheumatic arthritis patient should be treated and how various treatment measures should be coordinated at each stage, it should be determined according to the specific conditions of each patient. Therefore, patients should ask a doctor to conduct a detailed physical examination to determine the diagnosis and to clarify whether there are chronic tonsillitis, pharyngitis, and other diseases coexisting, because these chronic diseases have adverse effects on the entire human body and rheumatic arthritis. If these are found during the examination, timely treatment can be carried out. In addition, a small number of rheumatic arthritis patients may have rheumatic heart disease coexisting. A physical examination can help understand the condition of the heart, which will facilitate the treatment.

    To prevent rheumatic arthritis, first of all, it is necessary to strengthen physical exercise, which is particularly significant. Because physical exercise can not only improve the human body's resistance to various diseases, but also strengthen the body's tolerance to the effects of various natural conditions. In daily work and study, we should pay attention to combining work and rest, and prevent prolonged exposure to cold and humidity; if there is chronic tonsillitis, a doctor should be consulted for removal; these measures are very beneficial to promoting health and preventing diseases.

    Rheumatic arthritis is completely curable, and medical staff and patients should have full confidence and determination. In fact, not only have many patients recovered their health after treatment, but also some more "stubborn" rheumatic arthritis patients have been cured and returned to their construction posts after integrated treatment with traditional Chinese and Western medicine.

    谈谈风湿性关节炎
    傅连暲
    风湿性关节炎是关节疾病中较常见的一种，它是风湿病的主要征状之一。风湿病在世界各国均有发生，气候寒冷、潮湿的地方发病较多。
    风湿病的详细原因，目前还不十分清楚。但一般多认为是和一种“溶血性链球菌”的感染有关，主要是根据这样的一些事实：即在风湿病患者，往往先有由溶血性链球菌所引起的咽峡炎、扁桃体炎或猩红热等疾患，在间隔两三周之后发生风湿病；如果在这些疾病的早期，用足够剂量的抗菌素（一般是用青霉素）彻底地控制链球菌感染，就能预防风湿病的发生。上面所谈到的一些事实，固然说明风湿病的发生是和溶血性链球菌的感染有关，但是必须指出，并不是所有病人在链球菌的作用下都患此病，只有当人体对这种细菌病原体具有特殊感受性时才发生致病作用。
    潮湿、受凉、阳光缺乏，不注意卫生等通常被认为是本病的重要外因，然而上述这些外因只有在内因的影响下才能促进风湿病的发生。在资本主义社会，广大的劳动人民由于受到残酷的剥削和压迫，他们精神上和肉体上都遭受着许多痛苦的折磨，因而发病率就更高了。
    两千多年前，在我国现存的最早一部中医著作《内经》中，曾经谈到叫做“痹症”的关节疾患，实际上就包含了风湿性关节炎在内，那时候对于这种病已做了相当详细的叙述，并认为“风”、“寒”、“湿”三气是诱发此病的重要因素，这是与现代的观点符合的。由此可见，祖国医学在两千多年前对此病已有了相当深刻的认识。
    风湿性关节炎分急性和慢性二型。急性的除了关节表面发红，关节局部肿胀疼痛外，还有全身发冷、发热和出汗等症状。慢性的除关节肿痛外，一般是没有全身症状。风湿性关节炎的特点是，往往一处关节刚好，另一处关节又患，而且可能反复发作好多次，尤其是在天气改变的时候；最常被侵犯的是膝、肘、踝、腕、肩等关节。有时手指或足趾的小关节也可能受侵犯。这种病在急性发炎过去后，关节功能完全能够恢复正常，并不遗留任何畸形或运动不灵等不良后果，这是它和另一种叫做“风湿样关节炎”的重要区别，后者因在后期如治疗不当往往有关节功能不良或关节畸形的出现。
    对于风湿性关节炎的治疗，以往多是采取对症疗法的办法，效果不很满意，因而有些医务人员存在着“慢性病很难根治”的看法，而且也有不少病人对于完全治好此病亦失去了信心。去冬以来，北京医学院附属第一医院等单位的医务人员，冲破了多少年来所认为的“慢性病只能慢慢治”的旧观念，提出了“中西医结合综合快速疗法”，扭转了以往在治疗上的单纯局部观点和消极被动等观点。他们分析风湿性关节炎发病的不同阶段和不同特点，抓住每个阶段的主要矛盾和各种矛盾的关系，采取整体与局部相结合，动与静相结合的原则，应用中西医内外各科，包括药物、针灸、推拿、热敷、蒸汽疗法、气功、太极拳以及各种体操等等，发挥医务人员同病人的主观能动性，调动一切积极因素同疾病作斗争，经过半年多来的临床实践，取得了满意的效果，缩短了治疗时间，大大提高了疗效。
    至于每个风湿性关节炎病人应如何治疗，各个阶段的各种治疗措施如何配合，这要根据每个病人的具体情况决定，因此患者应该请医生详细进行体格检查以确定诊断，并明确有没有慢性扁桃体炎，咽峡炎等疾病同时存在，因为这些慢性疾患对整个人体及风湿性关节炎来说都有不利的影响，检查发现后就能进行及时的治疗。此外在少数风湿性关节炎患者可能有风湿性心脏病合并存在，进行体格检查就能帮助了解心脏的情况，从而有利于治疗的进行。
    预防风湿性关节炎，首先要加强体育锻炼，这点特别具有积极意义。因为锻炼身体既可以提高人体对各种疾病的抵抗力，又可以加强身体对于各种自然条件影响的耐受能力。在日常工作和学习中，应该注意劳逸结合，防止长时间的受寒受潮；如有慢性扁桃体炎则应该请医生摘除；这些措施对于促进身体健康，预防疾病都有很大的好处。
    风湿性关节炎是完全能治好的，医务人员和病员都应该有充分的信心和决心。事实上，不但有很多的患者，经过治疗，恢复了健康，而且还有一些更为“顽固的”风湿性关节炎患者，经过了中西医综合治疗，也得到了痊愈，重新走上了建设岗位。
