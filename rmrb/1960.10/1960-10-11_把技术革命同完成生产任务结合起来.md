    Combining Technical Revolution with Completion of Production Tasks
    Li Changmao, Worker at Tianjin Renli Woolen Mill
    I am the workshop director of the coarse spinning workshop at the Renli Woolen Mill in Tianjin. With the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, I encountered such a contradiction: how to grasp the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, while also grasping the daily production tasks and ensuring the over-fulfillment of the state plan. If grasped well, the contradiction can be resolved, achieving the goal of technical innovation and technical revolution promoting production; if not grasped well, it will affect each other, not only failing to achieve the innovation projects well, but also affecting the completion of the state plan. How to grasp it? I think that studying Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" can find a good way to solve it. This is to, through specific analysis, in the complex situation of thousands of threads, distinguish the important from the urgent, grasp the main contradiction and the main aspect of the contradiction, concentrate forces, attack the key, and promote the general.
    Our coarse spinning workshop did indeed have many contradictions in the technical innovation and technical revolution storm of the Red May Battle. In particular, there were few maintenance workers, a lack of machine parts, large production tasks, and little maintenance time, which presented us with many difficulties. In this situation, we also accepted twenty-four technical innovation projects, and we had to ensure the early completion of the state plan. The reason why we were able to both lead the masses to do a good job in technical innovation and technical revolution, and to over-fulfill the state plan, is because we made a specific analysis of the specific situation, and made appropriate arrangements for various tasks. We seized the innovation projects that were directly related to the completion of the current production tasks, placed them in a major position, and solved them as the main contradiction. Because as long as these innovation projects are realized, labor productivity can be immediately improved, which can play a great role in completing the state plan ahead of schedule. This will also make the enthusiasm of the masses for vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution higher and higher. At the same time, we also separated out a certain amount of strength to seize cutting-edge projects, in order to lay the foundation for continuously marching towards high, precise, and advanced. Of course, grasping the main contradiction to solve it does not mean that other secondary contradictions do not exist, nor does it mean that it is not important to solve secondary contradictions. Grasping the main contradiction to solve it is precisely to pave the way and lay the foundation for continuing to solve secondary contradictions. Therefore, our approach is to, while concentrating our efforts to solve the main contradiction, mobilize the masses to innovate, and grasp general projects, seeking quality in quantity, and seeking refinement in quantity. In this way, the contradiction of few people and many tasks can be resolved. For example, how to improve the operating rate and increase yarn production is a key project that our workshop must solve in the technical revolution movement, and it is also a key issue for improving production at present. We seized this key tightly, mobilized the shift maintenance workers and old workers, everyone contributed ideas and methods, and worked together. As a result, a major innovation project was realized in just six hours of hard work. The realization of this project eliminated downtime and greatly improved the operating rate, increasing yarn production by 400 kilograms per day.
    For another example, our workshop originally used the "stirring oil production method" to supply oil for yarn. Daily output was only 80 kilograms, falling short of demand and affecting the improvement of production. We seized this key to carry out technical revolution. This task was very arduous for us, but we were not intimidated by the difficulties. We mobilized the masses to actively think of ways. If there were few people, we asked university students who came to the factory to work from Tianjin University to combine with the old workers and join the battle together; and according to the instructions of the Party committee, we achieved "seven hands and eight feet" if there were few people, "seven mouths and eight tongues" if there were few methods, and "seven pieces and eight pieces" if there were few materials. Due to the full play of the subjective initiative of the masses, after a day and a night of hard work, this project was also realized. As a result, one process was reduced, labor was saved, labor intensity was reduced, and work efficiency was increased by thirty-six times. The realization of this innovation project is not only an important achievement in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, but also directly promoted the completion of the production plan for this month.
    In short, in any work we do, it is not enough to have a good desire to do the work well without correct methods. Our motherland is leaping forward by leaps and bounds, and our production tasks will become heavier day by day. We will face various difficulties, and we will often encounter such and such contradictions in our work. We must have the heroic spirit of daring to think, daring to do, and daring to break through any difficulties, and we must also truly master the key to opening up various difficulties. Facts have proved that Chairman Mao's great work "On Contradiction" is a universal key. It can open the door to people's wisdom, guide us to break through difficulties, and pass unimpeded on the road to progress.

    把技术革命同完成生产任务结合起来
    天津仁立毛呢厂工人　李长茂
    我在仁立毛呢厂粗纺车间担任车间主任的工作。随着技术革新和技术革命运动的蓬勃展开，我碰上了这样一个矛盾：如何在抓好技术革新和技术革命运动的同时，也能抓好日常的生产任务，保证国家计划的超额完成。抓得好，就能使矛盾得到解决，达到技术革新和技术革命推动生产的目的；抓不好，就会互相影响，不但不能很好地实现革新项目，而且还会影响国家计划的完成。如何抓呢？我认为好好学习毛主席的《矛盾论》就能从中找到好办法。这就是要经过具体分析，在千头万绪的复杂情况下，分清轻重缓急，抓住主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面，集中力量，猛攻关键，推动一般。
    我们粗纺车间，在大战红5月的技术革新与技术革命大风暴中，确实存在着不少矛盾。特别是保全工少，机件缺乏，生产任务大，检修时间少，使我们遇到不少困难。在这样的情况下，我们又接受了技术革新项目二十四项，并且要保证提前完成国家计划。我们之所以能做到既领导群众搞好技术革新和技术革命，又使国家计划的超额完成，就因为我们对具体情况做了具体分析，对各项工作作了恰当的安排。我们抓住与完成当前生产任务有直接关系的革新项目，把它放在主要地位，做为主要矛盾来解决。因为只要实现了这些革新项目，就能马上提高劳动生产率，对提前完成国家计划能起很大作用。这样，也会使群众大闹技术革新和技术革命的积极性越来越高。在这同时，我们还分出一定力量，抓住尖端项目，为不断向高、精、尖进军打基础。当然，抓住主要矛盾来解决，并不等于其他次要矛盾就不存在了，也不说次要矛盾解决不解决不关重要了。抓住主要矛盾来解决，正是为继续解决次要矛盾开辟道路，打下基础。所以我们的做法，就是在集中力量解决主要矛盾的同时，发动群众人人动手搞革新，将一般项目也抓起来，量里求质，多里求精。这样，就可以解决人手少、任务多的矛盾。比如怎样提高开车率，增加纱线产量，是我们车间在技术革命运动中要解决的一个重点项目，也是当前提高生产的一个关键问题。我们就紧紧抓住这个关键，发动跟班保全工和老工人，大家出主意想办法，一齐动手搞，结果仅仅奋战了六小时就实现了一个重大革新项目。这个项目的实现，消灭了停车现象，大大提高了开车率，每天可以增产纱线四百公斤。
    又如，我们车间原来是采用“搅拌制油法”供纱线用油，每天提早拉晚，日产量只达八十公斤，供不应求，影响生产的提高。我们就抓住这个关键进行技术革命。这个任务对我们来说是很艰巨的，但是我们并没有被困难吓倒，我们发动群众积极想办法。人手少，我们就让天津大学来厂劳动的大学生与老工人结合起来，一起投入战斗；并且按照党委的指示，做到了人手少就“七手八脚”、办法少就“七嘴八舌”、材料少就“七拼八凑”。由于充分发挥了群众的主观能动作用，奋战一天一夜，这个项目也实现了。结果减少了一道工序，节约了劳动力，减轻了劳动强度，提高工作效率达三十六倍。这个革新项目的实现，不仅是技术革新与技术革命运动中的一项重要成就，而且对完成本月的生产计划，直接起了推动作用。
    总之，我们做任何工作，只有搞好工作的良好愿望，而没有正确的方法，还是不行的。祖国正在一日千里地不断跃进，我们的生产任务会一天比一天加重，在我们面前会有种种困难，我们在工作中时常会碰到这样或那样的矛盾。我们要有敢想、敢干、敢于冲破任何困难的英雄气概，也要真正掌握住打开种种难关的钥匙。事实证明，毛主席的伟大著作《矛盾论》，就是一把万能钥匙。它能打开人们的智慧的大门，指导我们破除难关，在前进的道路上通行无阻。
