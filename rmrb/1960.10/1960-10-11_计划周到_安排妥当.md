　　Striving to achieve a summer harvest next year that is better than any previous year is a strategically significant task currently facing hundreds of millions of rural commune members. How can we win this battle well? The key lies in leaders at all levels further grasping the laws of local agricultural production, formulating detailed plans, and immediately organizing forces to put them into practice. The revised autumn harvest and planting plan that Liu Xigeng, First Secretary of the Xuzhou Prefectural Committee of Jiangsu Province, and Jiang Guitong, First Secretary of the Tongshan County Committee, and other comrades helped the Jiahe People's Commune with is a plan that embodies this spirit. After reading this plan, one feels that their leadership of the "Three Autumns" work is bold, knowledgeable, resourceful, and full of confidence and certainty in successfully completing the task.

　　This year's autumn planting must be extensive and of high quality, but the previous crops will clear the land late, and the "Three Autumns" work will be squeezed together, making the time very tight and the labor force strained. How can this contradiction be resolved? Should we shrink back in the face of difficulties, or should we adopt a revolutionary offensive attitude? The comrades of the Xuzhou Prefectural Committee, Tongshan County Committee, and Jiahe Commune Party Committee adopted the latter attitude. They viewed and analyzed the contradictions from a dialectical perspective, laid out all aspects of the contradictions, distinguished between favorable and unfavorable factors, and identified the crux of the problem, devising countermeasures one by one. For example, both autumn harvesting and autumn planting must seize the opportune moment. In terms of labor and time arrangement, there are both mutually contradictory and mutually integrated aspects. On the issue of harvesting sweet potatoes and planting wheat, some people initially thought that in order to plant wheat after the sweet potatoes, the sweet potatoes should be harvested early, which would affect the growth of the sweet potatoes; but not harvesting the sweet potatoes early would affect the time for planting wheat. Therefore, they could not make up their minds and hesitated to take action. They analyzed the situation, compared the importance of each task, and weighed the gains and losses. First, they affirmed that planting wheat early would result in a greater increase in production than the sweet potatoes growing for a few more days. At the same time, they decided to appropriately advance the sweet potato harvest period based on the planting time and growing season of the sweet potatoes, in order to free up the land for wheat. In their autumn planting plan, they first solved the crucial problems of how to plant extensively and on time. At the same time, they made detailed calculations for various autumn planting tasks around these issues, and made full preparations for the necessary labor, tools, fertilizers, and seeds. This allowed them to grasp the autumn planting firmly, while also taking into account the overall arrangement of the autumn harvest and other agricultural tasks, implementing segmented operations in a planned manner, and breaking through them one by one. In this way, they tightly grasped the season, ensuring that they knew what work should be done at what time, how many people should do it, and who should be responsible, all arranged properly without missing a step, in an orderly manner.

　　This meticulous planning and comprehensive arrangement laid a solid foundation for the victory of autumn planting, while also overcoming the phenomenon of tending to one thing and losing sight of another, which is prone to occur in the "Three Autumns" work. This event powerfully illustrates that when people are unclear about certain contradictions existing in the autumn harvest and autumn planting, and have not yet grasped its laws, it will become a rope that binds people's thoughts and actions. But when the contradiction has been fully understood and a solution has been found, it becomes a force that promotes the advancement of work.

    计划周到　安排妥当
    豫东
    力争明年获得一个比任何一年都好的夏收，这是当前摆在几亿农村公社社员面前的一项具有战略意义的任务。怎样把这一仗打好？关键在于各级领导进一步掌握当地农业生产的规律，制订周密的计划；并且立即组织力量付诸实行。江苏省徐州地委第一书记刘锡庚、铜山县委第一书记蒋桂同等同志帮助夹河人民公社修订的秋收秋种计划，就是符合这种精神的计划。看了这个计划，使人感到他们对三秋工作的领导有胆有识，富于谋略，对胜利完成任务充满了信心和把握。
    今年秋种要种得多、种得好，而前茬庄稼腾地晚，“三秋”工作挤在一起，时间很紧迫，劳力紧张。怎样解决这个矛盾呢？是畏难退缩呢？还是采取革命的进攻的态度？徐州地委、铜山县委和夹河公社党委的同志们采取了后一种态度，他们以辩证的观点来看待和分析矛盾，摆出矛盾的各个方面，分清有利因素和不利因素，找到问题的症结，一一想出对策。譬如，秋收和秋种都要抢时机，在劳力和时间安排上，既有互相矛盾的一面，也有互相结合的一面。在收甘薯种小麦的问题上，开始有人认为要早收甘薯腾茬种麦，甘薯的生长就要受影响，不早收甘薯又会影响种麦的时间，因此下不了决心，迟迟不敢行动。他们作了分析，比较了轻重，衡量了得失，首先肯定麦子早种比甘薯多生长几天的增产幅度大，同时决定根据甘薯栽种的早晚和生长期的长短，分别适当提早甘薯的收获期，给小麦腾出茬口。他们在秋种计划的安排中，首先解决了如何能够种得多、种得适时等对全局带有关键性的问题，同时围绕着这些问题，对秋种的各种农活作了详细的计算，对需要的劳力、工具、肥料、种籽作了充分的准备。这就既抓住了秋种，又照顾到秋收跟其他农活的全面安排，有计划地实行了分段作业，各个击破。这样，他们就紧紧掌握住季节，什么时候该干什么活，多少人干，由谁负责，都安排得妥妥贴贴，一着不漏，有条不紊。
    这种周密计划和全面安排的作法，为秋种工作打下了胜利的基础，同时也克服了“三秋”工作中容易发生的顾此失彼的现象。这件事有力地说明：当人们对秋收、秋种中存在的某些矛盾认识不清，和还没有掌握到它的规律的时候，它会成为束缚人们的思想和行动的一条绳索；而当矛盾已经被人们充分地认识并且找到解决的办法的时候，它又成为推动工作前进的力量。
