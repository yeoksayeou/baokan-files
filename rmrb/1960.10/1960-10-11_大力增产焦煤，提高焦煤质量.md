    In the current new high tide of increasing production and practicing economy, the coal industry sector must particularly focus on increasing the production of coking coal and continuously improving the quality of coking coal. Every coal mine with a coking coal production task should first complete and overfulfill the coking coal production task, and try to reduce the ash content and sulfur content of the coking coal as much as possible.
    Coal production occupies an extremely important position in the entire national economic development. Metallurgy, electric power, and chemical industries are inseparable from coal; railways, ships, and some automobile transportation in the transportation industry all require coal as fuel; and the kettle tractors, gas generators, and other power and drainage machinery used in agricultural production also rely mostly on coal as fuel. Coal is even more closely related to people's lives. Therefore, we must pay great attention to increasing production and practicing economy in coal. However, in the entire coal production, coking coal production is the most important link. Large and small steel enterprises across the country need coking coal, and coking coal is not produced by any coal mine in any place. Therefore, in the current movement to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel, focusing on increasing coking coal production has more urgent practical significance. Coking coal production must not only meet the needs of the steel industry for increased production in terms of quantity, but also must be high-quality coking coal with low ash and low sulfur content. From the perspective of coal washing production, the less sulfur stone and ash in coking coal, the higher the utilization rate of coal washing equipment and the recovery rate of clean coal. With high-quality clean coal, high-quality coke can be produced. If the quality of coke is high, the coke ratio in the ironmaking process will naturally be small, and the amount of ore charged into the furnace will inevitably increase. In this way, the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace can be greatly improved, and the high-quality and high-yield of pig iron will be guaranteed. This is a process of interlocking, mutual promotion and mutual restriction. Improving the quality of coking coal lays the foundation for the high-quality and high-yield of steel from the initial production link. From the perspective of transportation work, coal accounts for nearly 40% of the total volume of materials transported by railways across the country, and coking coal accounts for the largest proportion of this. Therefore, improving the quality of coking coal has a significant effect on tapping transportation potential and saving transportation vehicles and labor. Taking a coal mine with an annual output of 2 million tons of coking coal as an example, if the sulfur content of the coking coal it produces increases by 1%, then, among the train carriages responsible for transporting all the coking coal from this coal mine in a year, 440 of them are not transporting coal, but transporting useless stones. However, the coal-using unit actually only receives 1.98 million tons of coal. It also needs to add 440 carriages to transport 20,000 tons of coal to meet its actual needs. This means that a total of 880 carriages of transportation capacity are wasted.
    Some people may say: coal is originally mixed with rocks, and it is inevitable that the mined coal will contain some sulfur stone and ash. Yes, it is difficult to require each ton of coal to be completely free of sulfur stone and ash. However, can the sulfur content and ash content of coking coal be reduced to the minimum? The news of the Jingxing Coal Mine continuously improving the quality of coking coal published in this newspaper today shows that it can be done. Since January of this year, this coal mine has overfulfilled the state production plan every month. It has not only achieved high raw coal output, but also good quality. From January to August this year, the average ash content of the coking coal they produced was 0.71% lower than the national standard. After the increase production and practice economy movement started, the ash content in September was reduced by 0.04% compared with August; the sulfur content of coking coal reached the national standard. This shows that the quality of coal can not only be improved, but also greatly improved. The key to the problem is not whether the coal is mixed with rocks, but whether people actively strive to improve the quality of the coal. As long as people establish a strong quality concept, think of more methods, and do more detailed work, the quality of coal can be improved even more.
    How to further improve the quality of coking coal? The experience of Jingxing Coal Mine tells us: First, leading cadres and employees, from the ideological point of view, unify high yield and high quality, starting from the overall situation, not only seeing their own requirements for increasing production, but also paying close attention to the quality requirements of the using units. The Jingxing Coal Mine mobilized employees to adopt the method of detailed accounting, from the high and low sulfur content of coal to the impact on achieving high-quality and high-yield in steel production, which is a good way to unify high yield and high quality, and to unify the increase in production of their own units and meeting the needs of the using units. It is precisely because of such a comprehensive understanding from top to bottom, and the establishment of the idea of ​​attaching importance to quality, that a situation of "everyone picking sulfur stone, picking sulfur stone everywhere," and universally grasping quality has been formed in the entire mine. Second, on the basis of everyone attaching importance to quality, it is necessary to establish and improve various quality management institutions and systems to institutionalize and regularize quality inspection work. The "three picking" and "four no's" measures implemented by Jingxing Coal Mine are to control the quality of coal from the entire coal mining and transportation process. (The three picking are picking sulfur stone at the working face, electric chute, and loading; the four no's are that sulfur stone cannot be put on the shovel, on the electric chute, on the mine car, and on the train.) Obviously, with such a tight quality inspection network, sulfur stone and ash can definitely be greatly reduced. The experience of Jingxing Coal Mine also proves that carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution in coal mining and tunneling is an effective measure to improve coal quality and reduce sulfur stone and ash. For example, for coal seams with thicker sulfur stone, trying to implement separate mining and transportation is a good way to remove sulfur stone and improve quality.
    Vigorously increasing the production of coking coal and improving the quality of coking coal are important conditions for promoting a greater increase in steel production in the fourth quarter. The leading comrades of coal mining enterprises should fully rely on the masses and mobilize the masses to actively work hard to do this work well and make greater contributions to the great increase in steel production.

### 大力增产焦煤，提高焦煤质量

    大力增产焦煤，提高焦煤质量
    煤炭工业部门在当前增产节约的新高潮中，要特别抓紧焦煤的增产，不断地提高焦煤的质量。每个有焦煤生产任务的煤矿，都应当首先完成和超额完成焦煤的生产任务，并且尽量地降低焦煤的灰分和含?率。
    煤炭生产在整个国民经济发展中占有极其重要的地位。工业中的冶金、电力、化工工业，都是离不开煤炭的；交通运输业中的铁路、轮船和部分汽车运输，都要煤作燃料；农业生产中使用的锅驼机、煤气机以及其它动力和排灌机械，也是绝大部分都靠煤炭作燃料的。煤炭对于人民的生活更是异常密切的了。因此我们要十分重视煤炭的增产节约。但是，在整个煤炭生产中，又以焦煤生产为最重要的一环。全国各地的大小钢铁企业都需要焦煤，而焦煤又不是任何地方的任何煤矿都生产的，所以在当前以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，突出地抓焦煤增产，就有了更为迫切的现实意义。焦煤生产不仅要在数量上尽量地满足钢铁工业增产的需要，而且必须是灰分少、含?率低的优质焦煤。从洗煤生产来看，焦煤中的?石和灰分愈少，洗煤设备利用率和精煤回收率就愈高。有了优质的精煤就可以炼出优质的焦炭。焦炭质量高，炼铁过程中的焦比自然就小，入炉的矿石量也就必然增高。这样，高炉的利用系数就可以大大提高，生铁的优质高产也就有了保证。这是一个环环相扣，相互促进相互制约的过程。提高焦煤质量，这就从最初的生产环节上，为钢铁的优质高产奠定了基础。从运输工作来看，目前全国铁路运输的物资总量中，煤炭的运量将近占到40％，而其中又以焦煤所占的比重最大。因此，提高焦煤质量，对挖掘运输潜力，节约运输车辆和劳动力都有不小的作用。以一个年产二百万吨焦煤的煤矿为例，如果它生产的焦煤含?率增加百分之一，那么，一年之中担负运输这个煤矿全部焦煤的火车车皮，其中就有四百四十个不是运的煤炭，而是运的毫无用处的石头。而对用煤单位来说，实际上只得到了一百九十八万吨煤。还需要用四百四十个车皮增运二万吨煤炭才能满足它的实际需要。这就是说总共浪费了八百八十个车皮的运输力。
    有人也许会说：煤炭本来就是夹在岩石中生的，采出来的煤带点?石、灰分是免不了的。是的，要求每吨煤完全不带?石和灰分是困难的，但是，能不能把焦煤的含?率和灰分降低到最低限度呢？今天本报发表的井陉煤矿不断提高焦煤质量的新闻说明是可以办到的。这个煤矿从今年1月份开始，月月全面超额完成国家生产计划，不但做到了原煤产量高，而且做到了质量好。今年1月至8月份，他们生产的焦煤平均灰分含量要比国家规定的指标低0.71％。增产节约运动开始以后，9月份的灰分含量又比8月份降低了0.04％；焦煤的含?率达到国家规定的指标。这就说明，煤炭的质量不但可以提高，而且可以大大地提高。问题的关键不在于煤炭是否和岩石夹在一起，而在于人们是不是主动地去努力提高煤的质量，只要人们树立了强烈的质量观念，办法想得更多，工作做得更细，煤炭质量就可以提得更高。
    怎样进一步提高焦煤质量呢？井陉煤矿的经验告诉我们：首先是领导干部和职工群众，都从思想上把高产和优质统一起来，从全局出发，不仅看到自己增加生产的要求，还十分注意使用单位对质量的要求。井陉煤矿发动职工群众采用算细账的办法，从煤炭的含?率高低，算到对钢铁生产实现优质高产的影响，就是一种把高产和优质，把自己单位增产和满足使用单位需要统一起来的好办法。正是从上到下都有了这样一个全面的认识，树立起了重视质量的思想，才在全矿形成了一个“人人拣?石，处处拣?石”，普遍抓质量的局面。其次，是要在人人重视质量的基础上，建立和健全各种质量管理的机构与制度，使质量检验工作制度化、经常化。井陉煤矿实行的“三拣”和“四不上”的措施，就是从整个采煤和运输过程中把煤炭质量控制起来。（三拣即在工作面、电溜子、装车时拣?石；四不上即?石不上锨、不上电溜子、不上矿车、不上火车。）显然，有了这样严密的质量检查网，?石和灰分肯定是可以大大减少的。井陉煤矿的经验还证明：开展采煤和掘进的技术革新与技术革命，这是提高煤质，减少?石和灰分的有效措施。比如，对夹?石较厚的煤层，尽量设法实行分采分运，就是清除?石，提高质量的好办法。
    大力增产焦煤，提高焦煤质量，是促进第四季度钢铁生产有更大增长的一个重要条件。煤矿企业的领导同志们要充分依靠群众、发动群众积极努力把这项工作做好，为钢铁大增产作出更大的贡献。
