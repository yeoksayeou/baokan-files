Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th: The U.S. Federal Reserve announced on the 14th that in September, the U.S. industrial production index had fallen to its lowest level this year. The production index for this month was 107 (with the 1957 level as 100), a decrease of one point compared to August and a decrease of 4% compared to the level in January of this year.

    The "Wall Street Journal" recently reported that the investment situation of American companies is not good. It is estimated that the total investment of American companies this year will only be 36 billion U.S. dollars, while earlier this year it was estimated that it could reach 37 billion U.S. dollars. The newspaper said, "The reduction in estimated figures is because manufacturers, in view of the reduced demand for goods and the demand in many industries being much lower than equipment capacity, have postponed construction or the purchase of new equipment."

    The "Wall Street Journal" also said, "It is now clear that the recession in business has been going on for several months... The conclusion that a recession has occurred is based on some economic figures indicating a recession. These include: housing construction projects began to decline more than a year ago, and further declined this year, with only a slight rebound in August; steel production, which is only about five-eighths of the production last winter; new orders received by manufacturers have been slowly declining for seven or eight months, and various freight volumes have been lower than last year, even though there was a steel strike at this time last year; the trend of manufacturing workers and non-agricultural employment has been slowly declining until the summer; there are reports that the automobile and railway industries announced layoffs again last week."

    The newspaper said that in the retail industry, "weekly sales have been declining in the past few weeks, with a decrease of 5% in the most recent week." As for "another economic factor that can predict the future of enterprises - inventory, in most months of the first six months of this year, entrepreneurs were trying to reduce their inventory, but at the same time, the total inventory of domestic enterprises continued to rise. Entrepreneurs tried to reduce inventory, but ultimately failed."

    美国经济情况继续恶化
    工业生产指数降到今年以来最低水平
    企业投资状况不佳  商品零售额下降
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：美国联邦储备局14日宣布，在9月份，美国的工业生产指数已经下降到今年以来的最低水平。这一个月的生产指数是一百零七（以1957年的水平为一百），比8月份下降了一点，比今年1月份的水平下降了4％。
      “华尔街日报”不久前报道说，美国企业的投资情况不佳。估计今年美国企业的投资总数只有三百六十亿美元，而今年早些时候曾估计可以达到三百七十亿美元。这家报纸说，“估计数字减少是因为制造商鉴于对货物的需求减少，在许多工业中需求大大低于设备能力，因此他们推迟了建设或购买新设备的活动。”
    “华尔街日报”还说，“现在已经很清楚，企业上的衰退已经有几个月了……衰退已经产生，这个结论是根据一些表明衰退的经济数字而得出的。其中包括：住房建筑工程一年多以前就开始下降了，今年进一步下降，8月份只略有回升；钢铁产量，只等于去年冬天的产量的八分之五左右；制造商所得到的新订货，七、八个月来一直是慢慢下降的，各种货运一直低于去年水平，尽管去年这个时候还发生了钢铁罢工；制造业工人及非农业就业人数一直到夏季的趋势始终是慢慢下降的；有消息说汽车和铁路业上星期又宣布解雇了一些人。”
    这家报纸说，在零售业方面，“在过去几星期内，每星期的售货额都是下降的，最近一星期下降了5％”，至于“另一个可以预测企业前途的经济因素——存货，在今年头六个月的大多数月份内，企业家都是在争取减少手头的存货，但在同时，国内企业界的存货总数却不断上升。企业家们企图减少存货，但是终未成功。”
