    Production and Life Should Both Be Thrifty
    Huang Rongchang
    The Party calls on the people of the whole country to launch an increase production and practice economy movement centered on grain and steel, to ensure the overfulfillment of the tasks of grain, steel, and the entire national economic construction. For each of us, this requires us to work harder to increase production and to be thrifty in both production and life. Diligence means that we must be bold in thinking and doing, work diligently, use our brains diligently, carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement more deeply, and continuously improve labor productivity, so that the country can increase more wealth. Thrift means that we must practice strict economy, be careful in both production and life, and take hard work and plain living as an honor and extravagance and waste as a shame.
    In the past six months, in production, under the correct leadership of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company Party Committee, all comrades in our mechanized workshop have resolutely implemented the policy of "vigorously developing transportation mechanization" and building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results. Therefore, in the first half of this year, I and my comrades used more than 80% of waste materials to piece together more than 20 pieces of mechanical equipment, which improved production efficiency and reduced the heavy physical labor of workers. How did we do it in the process of innovation and creation? First, we implemented the policy of building with greater, faster, better and more economical results, and established the idea of "running all undertakings diligently and thriftily." Before starting work, we considered how to make the project proceed more and faster, so each of our projects adopted the method of designing and constructing at the same time. At the same time, we tried our best to use waste materials and substitutes, or to use steel like a clever tailor, in short, we tried every means to be careful and economical in using materials.
    My monthly salary, apart from the expenses for my children and some necessary expenses at home, has no other expenses for me personally. In recent years, I have not made any new clothes, and I only make them when it is absolutely necessary. Therefore, it is only a little food and a little cigarette money each month. I eat at most eight or nine yuan for food, and I don't smoke cigarettes every day. I only smoke a little when I am brainstorming in the office. In addition to these expenses, the money I have left each month is deposited in the bank.
    I will definitely respond enthusiastically to the Party's call, conscientiously check the production and saving situation in the first few months of this year, formulate a plan and specific measures for increasing production and practicing economy in the next few months, and continue to carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement with my comrades, and actively participate in the labor competition for increasing production and practicing economy. Not only must I do it myself, but I must also widely publicize it to my comrades, so that everyone can realize the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy, and everyone can build the country diligently and thriftily, manage the family thriftily, continue to go all out, aim high, work diligently and thriftily, and work hard to produce more grain and steel for the country.

    生产、生活都要勤俭
    黄荣昌
    党号召全国人民开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动，保证粮食、钢铁和整个国民经济建设任务的超额完成。对我们每个人来说，就是要求我们更加努力增加生产，在生产和生活上都要勤俭。勤，就是要我们敢想敢干，勤干活，勤动脑子，把技术革新、技术革命运动更加深入地开展下去，不断提高劳动生产率，使国家增加更多财富。俭，就是要厉行节约，无论生产、生活都要精打细算，要以艰苦朴素为荣，以奢侈浪费为耻。
    半年来，在生产上，我们机械化车间的全体同志在重庆钢铁公司党委的正确领导下，坚决贯彻了“大搞运输机械化”、多快好省建设社会主义的方针，因此今年上半年来，我和同志们利用了80％以上的废旧料，拼凑了二十多部机械设备，提高了生产效率，减轻了工人的笨重体力劳动。在革新创造过程中，我们又是如何作的呢？首先贯彻多快好省的建设方针，树立“勤俭办一切事业”的思想，我们在开工前就考虑到如何使工程进行得又多又快，因而我们每个工程都是采取了一边设计，一边施工的办法。同时，尽量作到利用废旧料和代用品，或者是学巧裁缝那样地利用钢材，总之，千方百计地作到精打细算，节约用料。
    我每月的工资除家里小孩和必需的一些开支而外，我个人是没有什么其他耗用的。最近几年来，我没有新制过什么衣服，要制都是非添不可时才制。因此每月就是一点伙食和一点香烟钱，伙食最多吃八、九元，香烟也不是天天抽，只不过是在办公室里动脑筋的时候才抽一点。除这些费用外，我每月剩的钱都存到银行里。
    我一定要热烈响应党的号召，认真检查今年前几个月的生产和节约情况，订出今后几个月的增产节约计划和具体措施，和同志们一起继续大搞技术革新、技术革命运动，积极参加增产节约劳动竞赛。不但本身要作到，而且还要向同志们广泛宣传，使大家都认识到增产节约的重大意义，人人勤俭建国，节约持家，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，克勤克俭，艰苦奋斗，为国家更多地增产粮食和钢铁。
