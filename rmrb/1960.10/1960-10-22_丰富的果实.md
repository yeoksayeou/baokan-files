    Rich Fruits
    For the sake of a happy tomorrow, our young people are meeting difficulties with a fighting spirit, overcoming them, and demonstrating great creativity.
  　Students at Shanghai Hetian Middle School collected fourteen kinds of waste materials, and after one hundred and twenty-seven experiments, extracted high-grade products such as crimson "B" reactive dye and amber asphalt. Students at Red Star Middle School overcame the difficulties of lacking data and raw materials, and created pure white and tough Nylon 9, and also explored a raw material with broad sources. Students studying chemistry have begun to be enthusiastic about the extraction and application of semiconductors; those participating in radio research activities are already moving towards remote control. The remote control sewage discharge equipment designed by students at Yan'an Middle School and the remote control fire fighting equipment designed by students at Jiguang Middle School have both been satisfactorily adopted by relevant units. The radio group of the Xuhui District Children's Palace, with more than ten members, all elementary and middle school students with an average age of less than thirteen, created the "photoelectric remote measuring concentration automatic alum adder" in the spring with the help of instructors, which was just adopted by the water company, and in the summer they sent their new product "remote measuring flow velocity meter" to the exhibition hall.

    丰富的果实
    为了幸福的明天，我们的青少年们以战斗的姿态去迎接困难，战胜困难，显示了很大的创造能力。
  　上海和阗中学的学生们收集了十四种废料，经过一百二十七次试验，提炼出酱红“B”活性染料、琥珀沥青等高级产品。红星中学的学生们突破资料、原料缺乏的难关，制出了洁白坚韧的尼龙9，而且探索到一种来源广阔的原料。钻研化学的学生开始热中于半导体的提取和运用；参加无线电研究活动的已经朝着遥控的方向奔去。延安中学学生设计的遥控排泄污水设备，以及继光中学学生设计的遥控消防设备都已被有关单位满意地采用了。徐汇区少年宫无线电小组十多个组员，都是平均年龄不到十三岁的小学、初中生，春天在指导员帮助下制成的“光电遥测浓度自动加矾器”刚被自来水公司采用，夏天又给展览馆送来了他们的新产品“遥测流量流速仪”。　（沪）
