Correctly Handling the Relationship Between Forest Logging and Regeneration
　　Xiu Guohan, Chen Boxian

The issue of forest logging and forest regeneration is one of the most fundamental issues in forestry production and forestry science.

In forestry production, forest logging and forest regeneration are a unity of opposites. Logging is the felling of mature trees to supply the needs of people's lives and construction, while regeneration is the restoration of felled forests to growth; the two are opposed. However, they are also unified; without logging, there can be no regeneration, and without regeneration, there can be no more logging. Because forests must be logged after growing for a certain number of years, otherwise, the forest will decline and decay on its own. Only by correctly logging forests can they be quickly regenerated under new conditions, and only then can the regenerated forests grow rapidly to meet the needs of the next logging. It is precisely because of this dialectical relationship of mutual transformation between logging and regeneration that forestry production is constantly moving forward.

To correctly handle the relationship between forest logging and regeneration to meet the needs of socialist construction, it is necessary to identify the principal contradiction and the principal aspect of the contradiction. In our country, forests are unevenly distributed, the stock volume is small, but the state's need for timber is very large, and the timber logging volume is also growing rapidly accordingly. Whether forests can be regenerated in time after logging, and whether forest resources can be expanded quickly, economically, and well, is a matter of concern for the country's current and long-term interests. Therefore, under the current conditions, the principal contradiction and the principal aspect of the contradiction is forest regeneration, and the continuous expansion of forest resources.

There are two ways to restore forests after logging: one is natural regeneration, which is to let it develop according to the law of natural forest succession without adding artificial measures after logging; the other is artificial regeneration, which is to take active measures to artificially accelerate the recovery and growth of forests. Which regeneration method should be mainly adopted in our country has always been a focus of debate in the forestry science community.

Some people believe that forests can only grow naturally according to the laws of natural succession. They take the theory of tree species succession to oppose artificial forest regeneration. They criticized, saying: "Artificial afforestation violates the development law of forest types, and the planted forests cannot survive, and even if they survive, they will not grow well." This view, which only sees things and not people, completely succumbs to nature and denies the dynamic role of people in nature. We are dialectical materialists, who respect objective laws and also attach importance to fully developing people's subjective initiative. We believe that people are by no means passively adapting to nature, but more importantly, they can actively transform it to suit the needs of socialist construction.

Fully developing people's conscious dynamic role does not mean denying objective regularity. The objective law of the development of things exists independently outside of people's consciousness and does not shift according to people's will. However, people can, through their own arduous efforts, correctly recognize objective laws and correctly master and apply objective laws to serve socialist construction. Practice has proven that people can change the unfavorable conditions for forest growth and development and actively develop favorable conditions by recognizing and mastering the objective laws of forest occurrence and development. Artificial afforestation can be carried out according to specific conditions, with planned allocation of tree species, strict selection of seeds or seedlings, artificial control of the spacing between trees, intercropping of forests and grains; full use of mechanical efficiency, effective improvement of the soil, greatly accelerating the process of forest cultivation, ensuring the growth of tree species, increasing land productivity and the growth of unit area, and completing the task of expanding forest resources quickly, economically, and well. Taking Korean pine as an example, if no artificial measures are taken and it is allowed to grow naturally, the entire succession process will take about 160 years until it can provide industrial timber of a larger diameter. It can be seen that the growth of naturally regenerated trees is very slow, the survival rate and preservation rate are very low, and some forest land is even replaced by weeds and shrubs, turning into barren mountains. However, the use of artificial regeneration is different from natural regeneration. Artificial afforestation can be carried out in the same year after logging. According to the artificially planted Korean pine forest in Caohekou, Liaoning Province (which has not yet fully adopted rapid-growth and high-yield measures), trees that have grown for 30 years are 12 meters high, with a breast-height diameter of 17 centimeters, and a stock volume of 153 cubic meters per hectare. The trees in a 25-year-old natural Korean pine forest are only 2.5 meters high, with a diameter of 3 centimeters, and the stock volume per hectare differs from that of artificial forests by six to seven times. If rapid-growth and high-yield measures are adopted, the growth of artificial forests will be even faster, and it is entirely possible to shorten the maturation period of Korean pine from the current 160 years to 30 to 40 years.

In the central and southern forest areas of our country, large areas of Cunninghamia lanceolata artificial forests have already been established. Due to the adoption of rapid-growth and high-yield measures, Cunninghamia lanceolata can become timber in 15 years or even less. The above examples fully demonstrate that people are not powerless in the face of nature, and it is certainly possible to effectively accelerate tree growth and achieve high yields in practice based on the laws of forest growth.

The criterion of truth is practice. Chairman Mao said: "Many natural science theories are called truth not only when natural scientists create these theories, but also when they are confirmed by subsequent scientific practice." Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and during the high-speed leap forward in forestry production, the working people of our country have accumulated relatively rich experience in artificial afforestation. Their basic experience is: afforestation suitable for the land, fine seeds and strong seedlings, careful land preparation, appropriate close planting, tending and protection, and reform of tools. These experiences summarized from practice are truly scientific theories. In the future, we must further deeply summarize the masses' experience, understand the laws of rapid growth and high yield of trees, and apply modern scientific achievements, such as new biophysical and biochemical technologies such as isotopes and growth stimulants, to more fully develop people's subjective dynamic role, promote tree growth, and achieve rapid growth and high yield of trees.

Those who hold the view of natural forest regeneration believe that the tree species cannot be changed during forest regeneration, and can only imitate nature. This is just as Chairman Mao said: "They believe that one thing can only repeatedly produce the same thing forever, and cannot be transformed into another different thing." Therefore, they overemphasize native tree species, believing that Korean pine is the only tree to plant in Xiaoxing'anling and that fast-growing tree species cannot be planted. This view is wrong. Precious tree species such as Korean pine certainly have their advantages, but the biggest disadvantage is that they grow slowly. Even if artificial regeneration methods are used, the maturation of Korean pine will take at least two to three times longer than other fast-growing tree species. Moreover, due to the needs of the high-speed development of socialist construction and the development of modern science and technology, the emergence of various man-made fiberboards and compressed wood has opened up broad avenues for the utilization of fast-growing tree species. The physical properties of the wood of fast-growing tree species after artificial treatment far exceed those of precious tree species.

Another argument against artificial regeneration is that artificial regeneration is costly and economically uneconomical; while natural regeneration is the cheapest. This view is also one-sided. Accounts must be settled, but accounts should be settled comprehensively. It is not enough to settle small accounts; more importantly, it is necessary to settle large accounts. This requires combining current interests with long-term interests, and combining partial interests with overall interests, and should focus on long-term and overall interests. You must never just see the trees and not the forest. On the surface, natural regeneration does not cost a penny. But what is the result of waiting for nature's gifts? In reality, it is slow, small, poor, and wasteful. Not only is the possibility of regeneration small, but the growth rate of trees is extremely slow and the material is poor, which is contrary to the requirements of the General Line. The speed issue is the most fundamental issue in socialist construction. High speed is the soul of the General Line. If forest resources cannot be expanded at high speed, it will inevitably affect socialist construction. Although artificial regeneration costs some money, the most important thing is that it wins time. In forestry production, shortening the maturation time of trees is the greatest saving. Marx said: "All savings, in the final analysis, are reduced to the saving of time." Artificial forests not only grow fast, but also have good material and high yield. Therefore, artificial regeneration is fully in line with the spirit of the General Line.

Since the founding of the country, especially since the Great Leap Forward, under the guidance of the Party's policy of "artificial regeneration as the main method, and artificial promotion of natural regeneration or natural regeneration as auxiliary methods," a massive and magnificent mass afforestation movement has been formed throughout the country. From 1950 to the end of 1959, the national afforestation area reached more than 730 million mu, which is more than 360 times the afforestation area during the 22 years of the Kuomintang rule. According to incomplete statistics in 1959 alone, more than 16 million mu of fast-growing and high-yield forests were built nationwide. This will provide extremely favorable conditions for accelerating socialist construction, rapidly expanding my country's forest resources, supplying large quantities of timber and other forest by-products, preventing natural disasters such as floods, droughts, winds, and sandstorms, and ensuring high yields in agricultural production.

On the forestry science front, as on other science fronts, the struggle between two roads, two viewpoints, and two methods will continue to exist for a considerable period of time in the future. In order to develop my country's forestry production at high speed and to adapt forestry production to the Great Leap Forward in various departments of the national economy, it is necessary to thoroughly criticize bourgeois idealism and metaphysical viewpoints, criticize naturalism, occupy the position with Marxism-Leninism, and guide practice.

    正确处理森林采伐与更新的关系问题
    修国翰　陈伯贤
    森林采伐与森林更新的问题，是林业生产和林业科学中最根本的问题之一。
    在林业生产中，森林的采伐与更新是对立的统一。采伐，是将成熟的林木采伐下来，供应人民生活的和建设的需要，而更新是把采伐过的森林恢复生长起来，二者是对立的；但是，它们又是统一的，不进行采伐也就无法更新，没有更新也就不能进行再采伐。因为森林生长到一定年限，就必须实行采伐，否则，森林将自行衰亡、腐朽。只有正确的采伐森林，才可能在新的情况下迅速使它更新，而更新之后的森林才能够迅速成长起来，满足下次采伐的需要。正由于采伐与更新的这种相互转化的辩证关系，才推动了林业生产不断向前发展。
    正确地处理森林采伐与更新的关系，使它适应社会主义建设的需要，必须找出主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面。我国森林分布不均，蓄积量较小，而国家对木材的需要量却很大，木材的采伐量也相应地迅速增长。采伐以后是否能及时更新，多快好省地扩大森林资源，这是关系国家的目前利益和长远利益的问题。因此，在目前条件下，主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面是森林更新，不断地扩大森林资源。
    采伐后恢复森林的途径有二：一为天然更新，就是采伐后不加人为的措施，听任它按照森林天然更替的规律发生发展；一为人工更新，就是采取积极的办法，用人工加速森林的恢复生长。我国主要应采用哪一种更新方式，一直是林业科学界争论的焦点。
    有人认为，森林只能按天然更替的规律自然生长。他们拿树种更替的理论，用来反对森林的人工更新。他们责难说：“人工造林违背了林型的发育规律，造上林也活不成，活了也长不好。”这种只见物不见人的观点，完全屈服于自然，否定了人对自然界的能动作用。我们是辩证唯物论者，既尊重客观规律，同时又重视充分发挥人的主观能动作用。我们认为，人们对于自然界，绝不是消极被动地适应，更主要地是能动地把它改造得适合于社会主义建设的需要。
    充分发扬人的自觉的能动性，这并不意味着否认客观的规律性。事物发展的客观规律，它是独立存在于人们的意识之外而不依人们的意志为转移的，但是，人们能够经过自己的艰苦努力，正确地认识客观规律，并且正确地掌握客观规律和运用客观规律为社会主义建设服务。实践证明，人们认识和掌握了森林的发生发展的客观规律，就可以改变对森林生长发育的不利条件，积极发展有利条件。进行人工造林，可以根据具体条件，有计划地配置树种，严格选择种子或苗木，人为控制树株的行距，实行林粮间作；充分发挥机械效能，有效地改良土壤，大大加速森林培育的过程，保证树种的生长，提高土地的生产能力和单位面积的生长量，多快好省地完成扩大森林资源的任务。以红松为例，若不采取人为的措施，任其天然生长，整个更替过程一直到能提供较大径级的工业用材，需要一百六十年左右。可见，天然更新的林木生长十分缓慢，成活率与保存率也都很低，而且有的林地甚至为杂草、灌木所代替，变成荒山。但是，采用人工更新，却与天然更新不同，采伐后的当年就可以进行人工造林。根据辽宁省草河口造的人工红松林（尚未完全采用速生丰产措施），生长三十年的树高达十二米，脑径十七厘米，每公顷蓄积量一百五十三立方米。而生长二十五年的天然红松林的树高仅二米半，直径三厘米，每公顷蓄积量与人工林相差六至七倍。如果采取速生丰产措施，人工林的生长还会更快，完全有可能使红松从现在的一百六十年成熟期缩短到三十至四十年。
    我国中南林区，已经营造了大面积的杉木人工林，由于采取了速生丰产措施，杉木在十五年或者更短一些时间就能够成材。上述事例，充分说明人在自然面前并不是无能为力的，肯定能够在实践中根据森林生长的规律，有效地加速林木生长，达到高额丰产。
    真理的标准是实践。毛主席说：“许多自然科学理论之所以被称为真理，不但在于自然科学家们创立这些学说的时候，而且在于为尔后的科学实践所证实的时候”。我国劳动人民在毛泽东思想的指导下，在林业生产的高速跃进中，在人工造林方面已经积累了较为丰富的经验，其基本经验就是：适地造林，良种壮苗，细致整地，适当密植，抚育保护，改革工具。这些从实践总结出来的经验，才是真正科学的理论。我们今后必须进一步深入地总结群众经验，摸清林木速生丰产规律，并应用现代科学成就，如同位素、生长刺激素等生物物理和生物化学的新技术，更充分地发挥人的主观能动作用，促进林木生长，实现林木速生丰产化。
    持有森林天然更新论点的人认为，森林更新时的树种不能改变，只能模仿自然。这正如毛主席所说：“他们认为一种事物永远只能反复地产生为同样的事物，而不能变化为另一种不同的事物”。因此，他们过分强调乡土树种，认为小兴安岭只能搞红松，不能搞速生树种。这种看法是错误的。红松等珍贵树种固然有其优点，但最大的缺点是生长缓慢，即使用人工更新的方法，红松的成熟至少也比其他速生树种多费二、三倍的时间。况且，由于社会主义建设高速度发展的需要和现代科学技术的发展，各种人造纤维板、压缩木的出现，为速生树种的利用开辟了广阔的途径。速生树种的木材经过人工处理后，它的木材物理性能又远远超过珍贵的树种。
    反对人工更新的另一论据，是认为人工更新成本高，在经济上不合算；而天然更新才是最廉价的。这种观点也是片面的。账是要算的，但是，算账应当全面地算，不能只算小账，更重要的是算大账。这就要把目前利益和长远利益结合起来，把局部利益和整体利益结合起来，而应以长远的和整体的利益为主，绝不能只见树木不见森林。从表面上看，天然更新是没花一分钱。但是，等待自然恩赐的结果如何呢？实际上是少慢差费，不仅更新的可能性较小，林木生长速度也极缓慢，材质不良，这是与总路线的要求相违背的。速度问题，这是社会主义建设中最根本的问题。高速度是总路线的灵魂。如果不能高速度地扩大森林资源，必然会影响社会主义建设。采用人工更新，虽然花了一些钱，但最重要的是它赢得了时间。在林业生产中，林木成熟时间的缩短是最大的节省。马克思说：“一切节省，归根到底都归结为时间的节省”。人工林不仅生长快，而且材质好，产量高，因此人工更新完全符合总路线的精神。
    建国以来，特别是大跃进以来，在党的“以人工更新为主，以人工促进天然更新或者天然更新为辅”的方针指导下，在全国范围内形成了一个声势浩大，规模宏伟的群众造林运动。1950年到1959年末，全国造林面积达七亿三千多万亩，等于国民党统治时期二十二年间造林面积的三百六十多倍。仅1959年的不完全统计，全国就营造了速生丰产林一千六百多万亩。这将为加速社会主义建设，迅速地扩大我国的森林资源，大量地供应木材和其他林副产品，防止水旱风砂等自然灾害的侵袭，为保障农业生产的高额丰产，提供极为有利的条件。
    在林业科学战线和其他科学战线上一样，两条道路、两种观点和两种方法的斗争，在今后相当长的时期内仍将继续存在。为了使我国的林业生产高速度的发展，使林业生产与国民经济各部门的大跃进相适应，必须彻底地批判资产阶级唯心主义和形而上学的观点，批判自然主义，用马克思列宁主义思想占领阵地，指导实践。
