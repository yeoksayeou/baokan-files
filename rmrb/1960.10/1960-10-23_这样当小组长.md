Being a Good Group Leader

    Chen Wanfeng: Good at Helping Those Who Lag Behind

    Chen Wanfeng is the trade union group leader of the No. 2 Group of the Class A shift in the No. 1 Fine Spinning Workshop of the Tianjin State Cotton Factory. With the continuous development of production, the workshop often transfers some key members of this group to other groups, and transfers some workers who are temporarily lagging behind to the group. Regarding such transfers, some group members are concerned that it will affect production and are reluctant to accept them. However, Chen Wanfeng believes that this is a duty that cannot be shirked. In his actual work, he, together with the Party group leader Li Yaohua and other key members of the group, studied and analyzed, and explored a law to help new group members improve quickly, which is "speaking, leading, helping, giving, and pointing."

    "Speaking": When lagging group members come to the group, they generally compare themselves with others; when they find that they are not as good as others, they often develop a sense of inferiority. In such a situation, the group leader and key members should talk to them more, carry out political and ideological education, and also tell them about the group's foundation, encouraging them to move forward with everyone.

    "Leading": After the lagging group members begin to eliminate their sense of inferiority, they generally want to see how advanced the people in the group are. In this second stage, the group leader and key members should lead by example, leading the group members from production to learning, setting an example in all aspects, and leading the new group members to move forward together.

    "Helping": With the help of the group leader and the driving force of everyone, the lagging group members begin to change. However, at this time, they often still have some concerns, and the group leader should pay attention to these concerns and take different methods to help them in all aspects and promote their accelerated transformation.

    "Giving": After the lagging group members transform, their awareness gradually increases, their sense of responsibility is strengthened, and they are not only active and willing to work in production, but also begin to care about the group, and some even take the initiative to participate in group work. This is the fourth stage. At this time, the group leader should give them some work in a timely manner, and considering that they have rarely participated in group activities and have few working methods in the past, while giving tasks, also give some methods. When they make achievements, give timely praise.

    "Pointing": When the lagging group members have made certain achievements in production and work, they often develop some complacency and slackness. At this time, the group leader should affirm their achievements on the one hand, and point out their shortcomings and directions for their efforts on the other hand, helping them consolidate their advanced achievements.

    This group used this set of methods to help more than 20 new workers become advanced producers. While constantly sending out key members, this group has continuously overfulfilled the national plan in a balanced manner for 48 consecutive months, and has been rated as a municipal-level model group for three consecutive years.

    Wang Qingming: Skilled in Using Troops

    Wang Qingming, the production group leader of the Class A shift of the No. 2 Paper Machine in the Tianjin No. 1 People's Paper Mill, is a good commander who is skilled in using troops in production. Since the beginning of this year, the production of his group has been at the forefront: in the first eight months, under the condition of variable raw materials, the production plan was overfulfilled by 10.89%; in September, not only was the output overfulfilled, but the consumption of pulp was also reduced by 20% compared with the plan.

    Wang Qingming is a third-grade papermaking worker, and four of the other six partners in the group are new workers. In terms of technology, it is relatively low in the whole factory. In 1959, when the leadership asked Wang Qingming to be the production group leader of this class, they said to him: "To do a good job in the group's production, the first thing is to take the lead, and more importantly, to give full play to the strength and expertise of each person...". Since then, this sentence has been deeply imprinted in Wang Qingming's heart. He always pays attention to observing the words and deeds of the workers in the group, so as to understand their ideological dynamics, temperaments, and technical expertise, in order to give full play to their enthusiasm. In July of this year, when the workshop leaders decided to transfer Zhang Baomin, a fourth-grade worker from Group B, to Wang Qingming's group, Zhang Baomin initially thought: I can't learn anything by working with a group of young people, and if I don't do it well, I will hurt my harmony, so I don't want to come. In order to give full play to the enthusiasm of this fourth-grade worker, Wang Qingming took the lead himself and educated all the workers in the group to unite him well and learn from him with an open mind. Since then, whenever production encounters key problems, Wang Qingming always consults with Zhang Baomin first, or assigns Zhang Baomin to assist in solving them. One day, the copper mesh was slipping pulp, and as usual, the production group leader had to solve it. This time, Wang Qingming handed the task to Zhang Baomin, while he followed to pull the water pipes, open the water gates..., acting as an assistant on the side. In this way, after a month, Zhang Baomin was able to share part of the group leader's work, so that Wang Qingming could better consider the problems in production, and Zhang Baomin also felt more and more energetic and worked more and more actively.

    Due to careful observation, Wang Qingming can assign work to each partner according to their abilities. One day, he suddenly took his female apprentice Li Ruyi to the pulp well to dismantle the pulp pump; people felt very strange. The reason is: in the past, the group leader took the lead in doing this kind of work, or sent skilled male strong workers. Later, I learned that Wang Qingming had long noticed the characteristics of Li Ruyi's fearlessness of getting dirty and tired in actual production, and believed that this little girl had an indomitable spirit, so he exceptionally took her down to the pulp well. In this way, there is one more person in the group who can dismantle the pulp pump, and the distribution of work is more active.

    Wang Qingming can also make a set of people and two sets of arrangements at any time according to the production situation and personnel changes, and use people properly. When production is normal, he sends apprentices to watch the car, and the master guides them; when changes occur in production, he immediately transfers the master to watch the car, and the apprentices assist them. In this way, production is guaranteed and apprentices are trained.

    Zhang Yinzhen: Enthusiastically Cares for People

    Communist Party member Zhang Yinzhen is the group leader of the No. 2 Group of the Molding Workshop of the Tianjin Dahua Rubber Factory. This group has twenty-two people, all of whom are female workers, and most of them have children. Zhang Yinzhen herself is also the mother of six children. This old worker with more than 20 years of work experience deeply realizes that female workers always have more problems in their lives. Some of them seem to be trivial things, but if they are not handled well, they will affect production. Therefore, when the Party educated Zhang Yinzhen to pay special attention to caring for the lives of group members, she always kept the Party's words in her heart and expressed them in her daily actions. Zhang Yinzhen's family already has enough children, but when she learned that group member Wang Shuzhen has a six- or seven-year-old child who is unattended when she works the middle shift and gets off work at eleven or twelve o'clock at night, she immediately found Wang Shuzhen and said to her: "Put the child in our house!" In this way, whenever she works the middle shift, Wang Shuzhen sends her child to Zhang Yinzhen's house and goes to work with peace of mind. Zhang Yinzhen is a group leader and a district people's representative, and she is very busy with her work on weekdays. However, whenever someone in the group takes a day off, she always takes time to visit them. Once, group member Zhu Xiufen did not come to work. Zhang Yinzhen went to visit her after work and found that Zhu Xiufen and her lover had a quarrel, and neither of them went to work. She first fairly and reasonably helped them analyze the reasons for the quarrel, and then openly and honestly criticized the two of them, and reminded Zhu Xiufen that it was not good for her not to go to work to affect production, which made the couple convinced.

    Under the teachings of the Party, Zhang Yinzhen, this group leader, wholeheartedly cares for the lives of every group member, from marital relations to mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relations, from child care issues, from commuting to and from work to housing issues, caring for them meticulously. Therefore, the group members all feel the warmth of the organization and affectionately call her "Sister Zhang", and naturally want to talk to her about any concerns they have. In this way, despite the fact that the workers have many children, the attendance of the group is guaranteed. Especially since the beginning of this year, the production of this group has been leaping again and again, and is currently in the forefront of the entire factory.

    这样当小组长
    陈万丰　善于帮后进
    陈万丰是天津国棉一厂一细纱车间甲班二组的工会小组长。随着生产的不断发展，车间里经常把这个小组的一些骨干调到其他小组去，把一些暂时处于后进地位的工人调到组里来。对于这样的调动，有的组员顾虑会影响生产，不大愿意接受。但是，陈万丰却认为这是义不容辞的责任。他在实际工作中同党小组长李耀华和小组其他骨干一起研究分析，摸索到了一条帮助新组员迅速提高的规律，这就是“讲、带、帮、给、指”。
    “讲”：后进组员来到小组，一般都要拿自己和别人比一比；当发觉自己不如别人的时候，往往会产生自卑感。在这样的情况下，小组长和骨干要多找他们谈心，进行政治思想教育，同时还要把小组的家底讲给他们听，鼓励他们和大家一起前进。
    “带”：后进组员自卑感开始解除了，一般地就要看一看小组里的人究竟怎么样先进。在这第二阶段里，小组长和骨干们要以身作则，带动组员从生产到学习，在各方面树立榜样，带领着新组员一道前进。
    “帮”：在小组长帮助和大家带动下，后进组员开始转变。但是，这时候，他们往往还有所顾虑，小组长要注意针对他们的顾虑，采取不同的方法，从各方面帮助他们，促使他们加速转变。
    “给”：后进组员转变以后，觉悟逐渐提高，责任心加强了，不但生产上积极肯干，而且开始关心小组，有的还主动要求参加小组工作，这是第四阶段。这时候，小组长应该及时地给他们一些工作，并且针对他们过去很少参加小组活动、工作办法较少，在给任务的同时，也给一些办法。当他们作出成绩的时候，及时给予表扬。
    “指”：当后进组员在生产上、工作上作出了一定的成绩以后，往往又会产生一些自满松劲情绪，这时候，小组长应该一方面肯定他们的成绩，一方面给他们指出缺点和努力方向，帮助他们把先进的成绩巩固下来。
    这个小组就用这套办法，先后帮助二十多名新工人成为先进生产者。这个小组在不断输送骨干的情况下，连续四十八个月均衡超额完成国家计划，连续三年被评为市级模范小组。
    王庆明　用兵有术
    天津第一人民造纸厂二号机甲班的生产组长王庆明，是一个生产上巧于用兵的好指挥员。今年以来，他所在的小组生产一直走在前面：头八个月，在原料多变的情况下，超额10.89％完成了产量计划；9月份，不但产量超额，纸浆的消耗比计划还降低了20％。
    王庆明是一个三级抄纸工，小组其他六个伙伴里有四个是新工人。论技术，在全厂是比较低的。1959年，领导上让王庆明当这个班的生产组长的时候，对他说：“要搞好小组的生产，第一条要带头干，更重要的就是要把每个人的力量和特长都发挥出来……”。从此，这句话就深深地印在王庆明的心里。他处处留心观察小组工人的一举一动，从中了解他们的思想动态、脾气秉性、技术特长，以便充分发挥他们的积极性。今年7月间，车间领导上决定把乙班的四级工张宝民调到王庆明小组里来的时候，张宝民开头认为：跟一帮小青年干活学不出什么来，弄不好还要伤和气，不愿意来。为了发挥这个四级工的积极性，王庆明自己带头，并且教育全小组工人，很好地团结他，虚心向他学习。从此，凡是生产上遇到关键性的问题，王庆明总是先找张宝民商量，或者交给张宝民去协助解决。一天，铜网溜浆，照例要生产组长去解决，这次王庆明却把任务交给了张宝民，而他自己跟着拉水管子、开水门……，在一边当助手。这样，经过了一个月的时间，张宝民就能够分担组长的一部分工作，使王庆明能够更好地考虑生产上的问题，而且张宝民也觉得越干越带劲，工作越来越主动。
    由于细心观察，王庆明对每一个伙伴都能做到因人派活。一天，他忽然带着女徒工李如意到浆井里去拆浆泵；人们都感到很奇怪。原因是：过去干这种活，都是组长带头下去，或者是派熟练的男壮工。后来才知道，王庆明在实际生产中，早就留意到李如意干活不怕脏、不怕累的特点，认为这个小姑娘有一股天不怕、地不怕的冲天干劲，就破例地带她下了浆井。这样，小组里又多了一个会拆浆泵的人，分配活更主动了。
    王庆明还能随时根据生产情况和人员的变化情况，做到一套人马，两套安排，用人得当。生产正常的时候，他就派徒工看车，师傅在一旁指导；生产上出现了变化的时候，就立刻调动师傅去看车，徒工在旁边当助手。这样，既保证了生产，又带了徒弟。
    张银珍　热诚关心人
    共产党员张银珍是天津大中华橡胶厂成型车间二组的小组长。这个小组有二十二个人，全部是女工，而且绝大部分都有孩子，张银珍本人也是六个孩子的妈妈。这个有二十多年工龄的老工人，深深体会到女工们生活上的问题总是比较多，有些看来是小事情，可是如果处理不好，就会影响生产。所以，当党教育张银珍要特别注意关心组员生活的时候，她时常把党的话记在心里，并且表现在日常行动里。张银珍家里的孩子已经够多了，可是，当她知道组员王淑珍一上中班，夜里十一、二点下班，家里有个六、七岁的孩子没人看管以后，就立刻找到王淑珍，对她说：“把孩子放到我们家去吧！”就这样，每逢上中班，王淑珍就把孩子送到张银珍家，安心地去上班。张银珍是小组长，还是区人民代表，平日工作很忙。但是，每逢组里有人歇班，她总要挤出时间去看望她们。有一次，组员朱秀芬没来上班，张银珍下了班就去访问，发现朱秀芬和她的爱人发生口角，夫妇俩都没有上班。她首先公平合理地帮助他们分析了发生口角的原因，然后又开诚布公地批评了两个人，还提醒朱秀芬，说她不上班影响了生产是不好的，说得夫妻俩口服心服。
    张银珍这个小组长，在党的教导下，就是这样全心全意地关心着每个组员的生活，从夫妻关系到婆媳关系、从看孩子问题、从上下班走路问题到住房问题，关心得无微不至。因此，组员们都感到组织的温暖，亲热地管她叫“张姐”，有什么心事就自然地要跟她念叨念叨。这样，尽管工人们孩子多，还是保证了小组的出勤。特别是今年以来，这个小组的生产一跃再跃，目前已跃居全厂先进行列。
