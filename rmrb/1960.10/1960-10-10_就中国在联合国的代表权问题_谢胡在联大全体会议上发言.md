Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, October 9th - Albanian News Agency, Tirana, 4th: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, Shehu, delivered a speech at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly on the 3rd regarding the question of China's representation in the United Nations.

Shehu said: The United Nations General Assembly is discussing the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations for the tenth consecutive year. Many delegations rightly believe that the issue of the representation of the People's China in the United Nations is related to the fate of the organization itself, and whether it is capable of realizing its basic purpose—ensuring peace and international cooperation. Today, the seat of China in the United Nations is unreasonably occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet, whom the victorious Chinese people's revolution of 1949 had thrown into the dustbin and who fled to the Chinese island of Taiwan under the protection of the bayonets of U.S. imperialism. In fact, the most populous country in the world is not represented in the United Nations.

We believe that if the United Nations has made some mistakes in its work, then one of the main mistakes is the failure to resolve the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in this organization. This is a very unjust thing in our time, a flagrant violation of international law and the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, for which the main responsibility lies with the United States government, which until now has been able to impose its will on the United Nations.

Shehu continued: The delegation of the People's Republic of Albania believes that this abnormal, unreasonable, and absolutely unjust situation, caused in the United Nations by the hostile attitude of certain countries, mainly the United States, towards the national system of the People's Republic of China, should have ended long ago. The representatives of the People's Republic of China should have occupied their rightful place in all the organs of the United Nations long ago. They should have brought the opinions of the great Chinese people here and made an absolutely necessary and very valuable contribution to the discussion and resolution of major international issues. The Albanian delegation welcomes the Soviet government's proposal that the United Nations General Assembly should study the issue of China's representation in the United Nations at this session.

It is acceptable for the United States or other countries to establish or not to establish normal relations with the People's Republic of China. However, they have no right, as they have done until now, to use voting machines, conspiracies, slanders, blackmail, and various pressures to prevent the United Nations General Assembly from discussing the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. The United Nations organization is not a combination of countries that must have systems liked by people in the U.S. government. Its importance lies precisely in the fact that it contains countries with various different social and political systems, all of which have promised to work towards achieving the purposes of the Charter.

The question of each country's political system is an internal affair of its people and has nothing to do with joining the United Nations.

In recent years, many social and political changes have taken place in many member states of the United Nations, even in the founding members, and even these changes are the result of people's revolutions, but their status as members of the United Nations has not changed in the slightest. In the case of China, what reason do people have to try to impose an attitude that is contrary to and incompatible with the United Nations Charter? According to recognized principles of international law, the right of a country to send representatives to the international stage should belong to the government that actually exercises power in that country. Regarding China, everyone knows clearly that, except for Taiwan, which is occupied by the United States by force, the only government that exercises full power in the entire country is the government of the People's Republic of China, which is supported by the entire Chinese people, the Beijing government which resolutely leads the seven hundred million Chinese people, united as one, towards socialism, despite the displeasure of the imperialist gentlemen. The right to represent China in the United Nations belongs to no other government, but only to this government.

Shehu condemned the U.S.'s hostile policy towards the People's Republic of China, saying: The aggressive policy adopted by the United States towards the great People's China is mainly manifested in the military occupation of Taiwan and other Chinese islands, in the crude interference in China's internal affairs, and also in many provocations against China's territorial integrity and national sovereignty. The United States has established a whole set of aggressive systems to aggress against the People's Republic of China, such as the notorious Southeast Asia Treaty Organization group, and the military treaty signed with Japan, etc.

The U.S.'s negative attitude towards restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is an integral part of this policy. In order to perpetuate their military occupation of Taiwan, and in order to deceive world public opinion, U.S. government figures have also trotted out the theory of "two Chinas," and have tried every means to cover up the truth about the People's Republic of China and its peaceful policies with fabricated condemnations and various conspiracies.

The Albanian government condemns this dangerous and reactionary policy of the U.S. government, which is completely incompatible with the principles of the United Nations and undermines the cause of peace and international cooperation. We fully support the undeniable right of the People's Republic of China to liberate Taiwan and other Chinese islands, and we consider this to be China's internal affair. The Chinese people have powerfully refuted the fallacy of the so-called "two Chinas" and other such slanders, which cannot deceive anyone. China is an indivisible whole, there is only one China: this is the People's Republic of China, a powerful socialist country with the largest population in the world and the only Chinese government—the government of the People's Republic of China. China is one of the founding members of the United Nations and one of the permanent members of the Security Council.

Opposing the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is tantamount to opposing international cooperation in fact, and to trying to turn the United Nations into a tool of imperialist policy; voting against the restoration of the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is tantamount to voting against peace, against disarmament, it is tantamount to supporting the victory of the U.S.'s aggressive and war policies, that is, voting in favor of imperialism and colonialism.

Shehu emphasized: Whether the U.S. government and some other governments like it or not, the People's Republic of China exists anyway, and is advancing with giant strides on the road of socialist construction. It is one of the most powerful countries in the world, and its influence in international relations and in the overall development of human society is enormous, and contrary to the wishes of imperialism, this influence is constantly growing.

When listing the achievements of the Chinese people's eleven years of construction, Shehu pointed out: The great achievements made by the great Chinese people in eleven years since China became a free and sovereign country and the Chinese people took their destiny into their own hands prove the endless creative ability of these talented people, and at the same time prove their steel-like unity around their democratic government, and prove the revolutionary transformation power of the socialist system.

The People's Republic of China has devoted tremendous strength to the country's peaceful construction and to the issues of peace and international cooperation. It has become a great factor for peace in the Far East and throughout the world.

Everyone knows that it made a great contribution to the realization of ceasefire agreements in Korea and Indochina. As early as 1958, the People's Republic of China withdrew the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea with the consent of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, while the United States continues to keep its troops in South Korea to this day, and it has turned South Korea into a dangerous hotbed for atomic aggression in the Far East.

Everyone knows the specific contributions made by the People's Republic of China to the formulation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between countries with different social systems and to the Bandung Conference. The People's Republic of China resolutely and consistently pursues this correct and principled policy. Today, it maintains normal diplomatic relations with thirty-four countries, trades with approximately ninety countries, and has established cultural ties with the vast majority of countries and regions in the world. It is constantly strengthening friendly relations with neighboring countries, as evidenced by the rapid resolution of the border issue with Burma, and the signing of friendship treaties with Burma, Nepal, and Afghanistan. The People's Republic of China firmly supports the Soviet Union's disarmament proposals, and it itself has made major initiatives to curb the danger of war and strengthen peace. In this regard, Premier Zhou Enlai's recent proposal on the conclusion of a treaty of peace and non-aggression between Asian countries, especially between Pacific Rim countries including the United States, in order to turn this region into a nuclear-free zone, is of particular importance.

These are the facts, this is the truth about the People's Republic of China. This objective fact cannot be covered up by the various accusations fabricated by the U.S. government and its lackeys. The U.S. government spends billions of dollars to carry out subversive and anti-communist propaganda, to support those who fabricate the most despicable lies and manufacture absurd and thoroughly reactionary "theories" that People's China favors war and opposes peace, to slander and smear the People's Republic of China. Everything has a limit. Logic shows that slander also has a limit. But to portray the foreign policy of the People's Republic of China as an aggressive policy, as the U.S. government does, or as its lackey "theoreticians" fabricate, this exceeds all limits.

Shehu said: For the prestige of our organization itself, the resolution of this issue becomes more urgent and necessary with each passing year. How can the United Nations organization be considered a world organization when this country, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population, is not precisely in this organization? How can the United Nations organization solve the major problems of our time, such as disarmament, the prohibition of atomic and nuclear weapons, peace and cooperation between countries, without the participation of the People's Republic of China? The People's Republic of China has formally declared that it is not bound by any international agreements that it does not participate in and that its official representatives do not sign.

Shehu pointed out: Today, no major international issue can be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China, and no discussion on comprehensive and thorough disarmament can be successful without the participation of the People's Republic of China. Whoever wants disarmament should first vote in favor of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations organization.

Shehu pointed out to the U.S. representative: When the socialist system was born in China, it did not get your State Department's approval, did it? Its citizenship was granted by hundreds of millions of Chinese people in their twenty-two years of heroic war against imperialism and its lackey Chiang Kai-shek, under the leadership of their glorious Communist Party headed by Mao Zedong.

The existence of People's China does not depend on your votes, and I can say it does not depend on your weapons either. The existence and development of the People's Republic of China was definitively determined as early as 1949; and the determination of the Chinese people, the correctness of the line of the party and government that leads them, the international solidarity of socialist countries, and the great sympathy of the people of all countries in the world for the just cause of the Chinese people are the guarantee of this existence and development.

The People's Republic of Albania has close friendship with the People's Republic of China, and it firmly supports the peaceful policy consistently pursued by the People's Republic of China, as well as the completely just position of the People's Republic of China on the issue of China's representation in the United Nations organization.

The Soviet Union's proposal that the General Assembly study and resolve the issue of restoring the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations organization at this session has received the support it deserves from many delegations. We insist on our view that any delay in resolving this issue seriously endangers the cause of the United Nations and peace.

Shehu finally pointed out: We are deeply convinced that the great People's China will inevitably occupy its place in our organization sooner or later, and the Chiang Kai-shek puppet will be driven out. We believe that the day will surely come when Taiwan and other Chinese coastal islands will be liberated and return to the People's China, because the world is moving forward, because imperialism cannot dictate the course of historical development. The development of history is determined today by the people of all countries in violation of the will and actions of imperialism.

    就中国在联合国的代表权问题
    谢胡在联大全体会议上发言
    新华社地拉那9日电　阿尔巴尼亚通讯社地拉那4日讯：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席谢胡3日在联合国大会全体会议上就中国在联合国的代表权问题发表了演说。
    谢胡说：联合国大会讨论恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利问题，现在已是接连第十个年头。许多代表团正确地认为，人民中国在联合国的代表权问题关系到这一组织的命运本身，关系到它是否有能力实现它的基本宗旨——确保和平和国际合作。今天，联合国中的中国席位被蒋介石傀儡无理占据着，中国人民1949年胜利的革命已把他扔进筐子里，他在美帝国主义刺刀的保护下逃入了中国岛屿台湾。事实上，目前世界上人口最多的这个国家在联合国中还没有代表。
    我们认为，如果说联合国在它的工作中犯了一些错误，那么主要的错误之一就是没有解决恢复中华人民共和国在这一组织中的合法权利问题，这是我们时代中非常不公正的一件事，这是对国际法和联合国宪章的基本原则的公然破坏，而对此负主要责任的则是直到目前为止还能把自己的意志强加于联合国的美国政府。
    谢胡接着说：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国代表团认为，这种不正常的、没有道理的、绝对不公正的情况，是由于某些国家，主要是美国，对中华人民共和国的国家制度采取敌视态度而在联合国中造成的，这种情况早就应该结束了。中华人民共和国的代表早就应该在联合国的所有机构中占有他们应有的位置，他们早就应该把伟大中国人民的意见带到这里来，并对讨论和解决重大国际问题作出绝对必要的、非常宝贵的贡献。阿尔巴尼亚代表团欢迎苏联政府提出的关于联合国大会应该在本届会议上研究中国在联合国的代表权问题的建议。
    美国或其它国家同中华人民共和国建立或不建立正常关系，均无不可。可是，它们无权像它们直到目前所做的那样，使用表决机器、阴谋、诽谤、讹诈、施加种种压力等手段，来阻止联合国大会讨论恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利问题。联合国组织并不是一些必须具有美国政府人士喜欢的制度的国家的组合。它的重要性，恰恰在于它的内部有各种不同社会和政治制度的国家，这些国家都答应为实现宪章的宗旨而努力。
    每个国家的政治制度问题是它的人民的内政问题，同加入联合国无关。
    近几年来，在许多联合国成员国中，甚至在联合国的创始国中，都发生了许多社会和政治变革，甚至这些变革是人民革命的结果，但是，它们作为联合国会员国的地位，却没有丝毫改变。在中国的情况下，人们有什么理由要设法把一种同联合国宪章相违反和不调和的态度强加于人呢？根据公认的国际法准则，一个国家在国际舞台上派代表的权利，应属于在这个国家内实际行使权力的政府。关于中国，大家都清楚知道，除了美国用武力占领的台湾之外，在整个国家中行使充分权力的唯一政府，就是获得中国全体人民支持的政府——中华人民共和国的政府，就是把团结得像一个整体的七亿中国人坚决地引导向社会主义的北京政府，尽管这一点使帝国主义大人先生们感到不愉快。在联合国中代表中国的权利不属于任何其它政府，而是只属于这个政府。
    谢胡谴责了美国对中华人民共和国的敌视政策，他说：美国对伟大人民中国采取的侵略政策，主要表现在用武力占领台湾和其它中国岛屿，表现在粗暴地干涉中国的内政，也表现在对中国的领土完整和国家主权进行的许多挑衅。美国建立了一整套侵略中华人民共和国的侵略体系，诸如臭名昭彰的东南亚条约组织集团，和日本签订的军事条约等等。
    美国对恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利采取的否定态度，就是这个政策不可分割的一部分。美国政府人士为了使他们对台湾的军事占领永久化，为了欺骗世界舆论，还搬出了什么“两个中国”的理论，并用虚构的谴责和各种阴谋诡计，千方百计来掩盖中华人民共和国的真相和它的和平政策。
    阿尔巴尼亚政府谴责美国政府这种完全不符合联合国原则、破坏和平事业和国际合作的危险的反动政策。我们完全支持中华人民共和国解放台湾和其它中国岛屿的无可否认的权利，我们认为这是中国的内政问题。中国人民已经有力地驳斥了所谓“两个中国”的谬论和诸如此类的其它诽谤，这些诽谤是骗不了任何人的。中国是一个不可分割的整体，只有一个中国：这就是中华人民共和国，这是一个强大的社会主义国家，拥有世界上最多的人口和唯一的中国政府——中华人民共和国政府。中国是联合国的创始国之一，是安全理事会常任理事国之一。
    反对恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，就等于在事实上反对国际合作，等于竭力把联合国变成帝国主义政策的工具；投票反对恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的权利，就等于投票反对和平，反对裁军，就等于赞成美国的侵略和战争政策获得胜利，这就是在投票赞成帝国主义和殖民主义。
    谢胡强调指出：不管美国政府和某些其它政府喜欢不喜欢，中华人民共和国反正存在着，并且在社会主义建设的大道上以巨人的步伐前进着。它是世界上最强大的国家之一，它在国际关系方面和在人类社会总的发展方面的影响是巨大的，并且同帝国主义的愿望相反，这种影响还在不断地增长。
    谢胡在列举中国人民十一年建设的成就时指出：自从中国成为一个自由和主权国家以及中国人民把命运掌握在自己手里以来，伟大的中国人民在十一年中取得的巨大成就，证明这些天才的人民无穷无尽的创造能力，同时证明他们围绕着他们的民主政府的钢铁般的团结，证明社会主义制度的革命性改造力量。
    中华人民共和国把巨大的力量贯注在国家的和平建设上和和平与国际合作问题上。它已成了远东和全世界的伟大的和平因素。
    大家都知道，它对于在朝鲜和印度支那实现停火协定方面作出了巨大贡献。早在1958年，中华人民共和国就在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的同意下，从朝鲜撤退了中国志愿军，而美国直到今天还继续把它的军队留在南朝鲜，它已把南朝鲜变成了在远东进行原子侵略的危险温床。
    大家都知道中华人民共和国对制定不同社会制度国家和平共处五项原则以及对万隆会议作出的具体贡献。中华人民共和国坚决一贯地奉行这项正确的原则性政策。今天，它同三十四个国家保持正常的外交关系，大约同九十个国家进行贸易，而且同世界上绝大部分国家和地区建立了文化联系。它不断地加强同邻国的友好关系，同缅甸的边界问题的迅速解决，以及同缅甸、尼泊尔和阿富汗签订友好条约，就证明了这一点。中华人民共和国坚决支持苏联的裁军建议，它自己为了制止战争危险和加强和平，也作了重大的倡议。在这方面，周恩来总理最近提出的关于亚洲各国之间，特别是包括美国在内的太平洋沿岸国家之间，签订和平与互不侵犯条约、以便把这一地区变成无原子地区的建议，具有特别重要的意义。
    这些都是事实，这就是关于中华人民共和国的真象。这种客观事实不可能被美国政府及其仆从所捏造的各种责难所掩盖。美国政府花费以十亿计的美元，来进行颠复和反共宣传，来豢养那些捏造诬蔑中华人民共和国的最卑鄙的谎言和制造荒谬的彻底反动的“理论”的人们，这些谎言和“理论”说什么人民中国赞成战争和反对和平。什么事情都有一个限度。逻辑表明，诽谤也要有个限度。但是，把中华人民共和国的对外政策说成是侵略政策，像美国政府所说的那样，或者像它的仆从“理论家”所捏造的那样，这就超过了一切限度。
    谢胡说：对于我们这个组织的威信本身来说，每过一年这个问题的解决就更加迫切和必要了。当这个拥有世界人口四分之一的国家恰恰不在这个组织里的时候，联合国组织怎样能被认为是一个世界性组织呢？如果没有中华人民共和国参加，联合国组织又怎能解决我们时代的重大问题，诸如裁军、禁止原子和核武器、和平和各国之间合作的问题呢？中华人民共和国正式宣布过，它不受没有它参加和没有它的正式代表签字的任何国际协定的约束。
    谢胡指出：今天任何重大国际问题要是没有人民中国参加，就不可能解决，要是没有人民中国参加，任何有关全面和彻底裁军的讨论都不可能成功。谁希望裁军，它首先就应该投票支持恢复中华人民共和国在联合国组织中的合法权利。
    谢胡向美国代表指出：当社会主义制度在中国诞生时，它并没有得到你们国务院的批准啊，它的公民权，是几亿中国人民在他们以毛泽东为首的光荣的共产党领导下进行的、反对帝国主义及其奴仆蒋介石的二十二年的英勇战争赋予它的。
    人民中国的存在不取决于你们的投票，我可以说也不取决于你们的武器。中华人民共和国的存在和发展早在1949年就肯定地确定了；而中国人民的决心、领导他们的党和政府的路线的正确、社会主义国家的国际团结、以及世界各国人民对中国人民的正义事业的巨大同情，就是这种存在和发展的保证。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国同中华人民共和国有紧密的友谊，它坚决支持中华人民共和国一贯奉行的和平政策，以及中华人民共和国对中国在联合国组织中的代表权问题的完全正义的立场。
    苏联建议联大在本届会议上研究和解决恢复中华人民共和国在联合国组织中的权利问题，这项建议得到了它应得的许多代表团的支持。我们坚持我们的这一观点：对解决这个问题的任何拖延，都严重地危害联合国与和平的事业。
    谢胡最后指出：我们深信，伟大的人民中国迟早都必然会占有它在我们这个组织中的位置，而蒋介石傀儡将被赶出去，我们相信，台湾和其他中国沿海岛屿将被解放而重归人民中国的日子必将到来，因为世界在前进，因为帝国主义无法规定历史发展的进程。历史的发展今天是由各国人民在违反帝国主义的意志和行动的情况下确定的。
