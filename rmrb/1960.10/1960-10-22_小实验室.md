    Small Laboratory
    Chen Yongqing, a student at Beijing No. 21 Middle School, has loved science since he was a child. When he was in the second year of junior high school, during chemistry class, he found the teacher's experiments very interesting. He discussed with his friend Quan Lushan, "Let's set up a laboratory too!" They tried every possible way to find materials. Some went to waste recycling stations to exchange scrap copper and iron; others went to the waste piles discarded by hospitals to find bottles, glass tubes, and the like. They used aspirin bottles as test tubes, and ink bottles with light bulb sockets to make alcohol lamps. They used three rulers, a piece of copper wire, and two wooden sticks to make a balance. His classmate Wang Lu supported him with two stethoscope copper tubes, which he turned into experimental conduits. Other classmates also sent him minerals, ferrous sulfate, and other materials, which he put to good use. When the small laboratory was established, he warmly welcomed his friends to visit and use it.
    This simple laboratory has helped them understand many chemical principles and consolidate their classroom knowledge. After each chemistry class, Chen Yongqing always personally experiments in the laboratory, sometimes with unexpected gains.
    In the past year or so, he has also used this rudimentary equipment to produce more than thirty kinds of chemical substances such as ferric carbonate and wood oil. He also often helps his classmates with science and technology activities. His academic performance is good in all subjects, and he has been rated a "Three-Good" student and an outstanding Young Pioneer several times. (Text)

    小实验室
    北京市二十一中学生陈永清，从小就喜欢科学。在初中二年级上化学课时，他看到老师做实验觉得真有意思。他就和小伙伴全陆商量：“咱们也搞个实验室吧！”他们千方百计找材料，有的去废品收购站把废铜旧铁换来；有的到医院丢弃的废品堆里去找瓶子、玻璃管等。他们用装阿斯匹林的药瓶作试管，用墨水瓶加上灯泡口做成了酒精灯。用三个尺子、一段铜丝、两根木棍等材料就做成了天秤。同学王禄支援他两个听诊器的铜管，他做成了实验导管。其他同学还送给他矿石，硫酸亚铁等材料，他也一一用上了。小实验室建立起来，他热情招待小伙伴来参观和试用。
    这简单的实验室，帮助了他们知道很多化学原理，巩固了课堂知识。陈永清每次上完化学课一定要亲自到实验室中试验，有时还可以得到意外的收获。
    一年多来，他还用这种土设备制出炭酸高铁，木油等三十多种化学物品。他也经常帮助同学搞科学技术活动，他的学习成绩各科都好，几次被评为“三好”学生，优秀少先队员。　（文）
