    China-North Korea Friendship Basin
    Xiao Bai
    In the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, there is a large Korean wooden basin on display. This basin is carved from the root of an ancient tree. Judging from its old and mottled appearance, it must have been used by the Korean people for a very long time. But on this day ten years ago, it wrote a new and glorious heroic chapter for the eternal friendship between China and North Korea!
    In the late autumn of 1950, the Chinese People's Volunteers, who had just gone abroad to resist the American aggressors, in order to pursue and annihilate the fleeing American devils, used a small force to contain a large group of enemies under Flying Tiger Mountain, northeast of Jiachuan, Korea. A fierce battle broke out. The enemy, relying on its superior firepower, thought it could wipe out the Volunteers immediately, but the battle lasted from dawn to dusk, and batches of American bandits fell under Flying Tiger Mountain.
    The Korean people were very excited to see the Chinese People's Volunteers heroically resisting the American aggressors and annihilating large numbers of enemies, but they were also worried about the outstanding Chinese sons and daughters who had been fighting for a whole day without eating a single grain of rice. At this time, many Korean villagers braved the enemy's artillery fire and broke through layers of blockades to deliver food to the Volunteers. Among them, a Korean woman, Park Hyo-nam, also made a large pot of white rice and wanted to personally go to Flying Tiger Mountain to deliver food to the Volunteers.
    Sister-in-law Park, dressed in a white skirt and with the wooden basin full of white rice on her head, bravely passed through the smoke and braved the fierce artillery fire, calmly heading towards Flying Tiger Mountain.
    Suddenly, Sister-in-law Park fell in the middle of the mountain with a deafening sound. When Sister-in-law Park woke up, half of her white skirt had been dyed red with her own blood, but she was most concerned about whether the rice she was delivering to the Volunteers had spilled. Because Sister-in-law Park had prepared early and packed it tightly before going up the mountain, the rice had not spilled. This made her forget the pain. She struggled to get up, and just as she was about to lift the wooden basin, her eyes went black, and an unbearable stabbing pain traveled from her leg to her heart. "What should I do? Should I leave the rice basin and go back down the mountain?" "No! If the Volunteers don't eat their fill, how can they annihilate more devils?" Sister-in-law Park mustered her courage, biting the ribbon on her skirt tightly with her teeth, holding the wooden basin in one hand and supporting herself on the mountain rocks with the other, dragging the rice basin towards the top of Flying Tiger Mountain with serious injuries. Along the way, her blood stained countless stones on Flying Tiger Mountain. Many times she struggled to wake up from a coma, and finally used all her strength to send the rice to the top of the mountain.

    中朝友谊盆
    晓白
    在中国人民革命军事博物馆里，陈列着一个朝鲜大木盆，这个盆是用一个古老的大树根刻制而成的，从它的陈旧斑驳的程度上来看，肯定是朝鲜人民使用了很久很久了，但它在十年前的今天，为中朝永恒的友谊写下了一首新的辉煌的英雄诗篇！
    1950年深秋，刚刚出国抗击美国侵略军的中国人民志愿军，为了追歼逃跑中的美国鬼子，把一大股敌人用少数兵力给牵制在朝鲜价川东北的飞虎山下，一场激烈的战斗打响了，敌人凭着它优势的火力，以为马上就可以把志愿军消灭掉，可是战斗从黎明打到了黄昏，美国强盗一批又一批地倒在飞虎山下。
    朝鲜人民看到中国人民志愿军英勇地抗击美国侵略军，大批大批地歼灭敌人，都非常兴奋，可是也为战斗了整整一天还未吃一粒饭的中国优秀儿女着急。这时，有许多朝鲜老乡冒着敌人的炮火，突破层层封锁给志愿军送饭。其中，有一名朝鲜妇女朴孝男，也做了一大锅白米饭，并且要亲自上飞虎山去送饭给志愿军。
    朴大嫂身穿白色衣裙，头顶着这个木盆，里面盛满着白米饭，英勇地穿过烟雾，冒着激烈的炮火，沉着地向飞虎山奔去。
    突然间，朴大嫂随着一声震耳欲聋的响声，倒在半山腰间。当朴大嫂醒来时，她那白色的衣裙已被自己的鲜血染红了半边，可是她最关心的还是看看送给志愿军的饭撒了没有，由于朴大嫂早有准备，上山前包得挺紧，所以没有撒了饭。这使她忘了疼痛，她艰难地爬起来，正要顶这木盆时，眼一黑，一阵难以忍受的绞痛从腿部一下传到心房。“怎么办？难道丢下饭盆，返下山去吗？”“不！志愿军不吃饱，怎么能狠狠地多消灭些鬼子呢。”朴大嫂鼓起了勇气，用牙咬紧了衣裙上的飘带，一手抓着这木盆，一手扶着山石，负着重伤艰难地把饭盆向飞虎山上拖去。一路上，她的鲜血不知染红了多少块飞虎山上的石头，多少次她从昏厥中挣扎醒来，终于用尽全力把饭送上了山顶。
