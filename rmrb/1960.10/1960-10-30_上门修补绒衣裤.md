    On-Site Repair of Flannel Clothing
    The mobile service team for repairing flannel clothing and pants from the Beijing Department Store Wholesale Company's Sample Factory came to the Fanjia Hutong Building of the Municipal People's Committee on the pre-arranged date (September 21st). Soon, many cadres arrived, some to replace the cuffs of their flannel shirts, others to replace the collars, and still others to sew up open seams. One cadre spent 60 cents to replace the cuffs on two flannel shirts and said to the service staff with satisfaction: "This method of yours is excellent, saving both time and convenience." This service team not only replaces flannel shirt cuffs and collars, but also repairs cotton-wool undershirts and pants, sews up open seams, and patches holes. By adopting this method of accepting jobs on-site and repairing them on-site, they have repaired more than 2,000 pieces of various knitwear and cotton textiles in this one government office alone.

    上门修补绒衣裤
    北京市百货批发公司样品厂修补绒衣绒裤流动服务组，按照事先约定好的日期（9月21日）携带机器来到了市人民委员会范家胡同大楼之后，不一会就来了许多干部，有的换绒衣袖口，有的换绒衣领子，有的缝开线。一位干部花了六角钱换好了两件绒衣袖口，满意地对服务员说：你们这种办法太好了，又省时间又便利。这个服务组不仅换绒衣袖口，换绒衣领子，还修补棉毛衫裤、缝开线、补破洞等项目。他们采取这种上门当场接活，当场修补的办法，光在这一个机关就修补了各种针棉织品二千多件。
