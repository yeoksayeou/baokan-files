Xinhua News Agency, October 18th dispatch from Detroit: U.S. President Eisenhower delivered a speech at a luncheon held by major Detroit automobile industry capitalists on the 17th, advocating that the United States must intensify its efforts to control underdeveloped countries.

He is traveling to many states to campaign for Vice President Nixon in the upcoming presidential election. In this speech, the first delivered during his travels, Eisenhower expressed deep unease about the strong desire of people in underdeveloped countries to break free from the shackles of imperialism and strive to change their poverty and backwardness. He maliciously attacked this revolutionary movement of the people in underdeveloped countries as "generating increasingly acute tensions and unrest in the world," saying that the existence of such "vast areas of hatred and turmoil" would "destroy the system we (referring to the U.S. ruling group) now enjoy freely" and make "the series of problems at our doorstep increasingly serious." Eisenhower, acting as a world policeman, clamored that the United States, as the "leader of the free world," could not "sit idly by" in the face of this situation.

Eisenhower believes that the support of socialist countries for the national independence movements of people in underdeveloped countries makes the U.S. effort to maintain the colonial system "difficult and troublesome." He also said worriedly that people in underdeveloped countries are now "looking with envious eyes at the communist system" because this system has made "tangible progress" in "the production of food, goods, and armaments in a short period of years." He said, "The theory of socialized production is tempting. At the very least, it promises to dramatically change the past and present material poverty."

Eisenhower's speech shows that, in order to control underdeveloped countries, the United States wants to try to influence these countries so that they "effectively cooperate" with the United States. In this regard, he specifically mentioned that the United States should continue to use "aid," this tool of aggression, to infiltrate and control underdeveloped countries, and he advocated that other countries, under the leadership of the United States, should "jointly formulate principles" to promote a "general plan" of aggression against underdeveloped countries under the guise of "aid."

He also asserted that in countries "constantly in unstable situations" where the "time for revolution is ripe," the United States must try to enable these countries to carry out "peaceful and orderly" "internal reforms" "within the framework of the private enterprise system" in order to prevent the occurrence of "violence."

Eisenhower emphasized that the U.S. government must "go all out" to promote its policy of aggression. He said that the leaders of the U.S. government must insist on "fulfilling our national responsibilities at home and abroad—especially in the area of defense (military)."

    害怕革命风暴　鼓吹“和平改革”
    艾森豪威尔说要利用美“援”加紧控制不发达国家
    据新华社18日讯　底特律消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔17日在底特律汽车工业大资本家举行的午宴会上发表演说，鼓吹美国必须加紧设法控制不发达国家地区。
    他正在为副总统尼克松进行下届总统竞选，到许多个州去旅行。在他旅行期间第一次发表的这篇演说里，艾森豪威尔对于不发达国家人民强烈要求摆脱帝国主义的桎梏、争取改变贫穷和落后状态，表示深切的不安。他恶意地攻击不发达国家人民的这种革命运动“会产生世界上日益加剧的紧张局势和动乱”，说什么这样“广大的仇恨和骚乱的地区的存在”将会“摧毁我们（指美国统治集团）现在自由自在享受”的制度，并使“我们大门口的一连串问题越来越严重”。艾森豪威尔以世界宪兵自居，叫嚷美国作为“自由世界的领袖”，对这种情况不能“放任不管”。
    艾森豪威尔认为，社会主义国家人民支持不发达国家人民的民族独立运动，使得美国维持殖民制度的努力“棘手难办”。他还忧心忡忡地说，不发达国家人民现在“正用羡慕的眼光去看共产主义制度”，“因为这个制度在生产粮食、货物和军备方面在短短不多几年的期间”取得了“切实的进展”。他说，“社会化生产的理论是诱人的。至少，它许诺能够急剧地改变过去和目前的物质贫困状况。”
    艾森豪威尔讲话表明，为了控制不发达国家，美国要设法影响这些国家，使这些国家同美国“进行有效的合作”。他在这方面特别提到美国要继续利用“援助”这个侵略工具来渗入和控制不发达国家，并且鼓吹其他国家在美国的领导下“共同制订原则”，在“援助”的幌子下推行侵略不发达国家的“总计划”。
    他并且主张，在“经常处于不稳定的局面”，人民“革命的时机成熟”的国家里，美国必须设法使这些国家在“私人企业制度的范围内”进行“和平地、有秩序地”“内部改革”，以阻止发生“暴力行为”。
    艾森豪威尔强调，美国政府必须“全力以赴地”推行它的侵略政策。他说，美国政府的领导人必须坚持“履行我们国家的对内和对外的责任——特别是防御（军事）方面”。
