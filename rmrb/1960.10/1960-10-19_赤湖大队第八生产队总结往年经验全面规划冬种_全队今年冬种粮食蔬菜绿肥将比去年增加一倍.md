Fuzhou, October 18th (This newspaper) – Encouraged by the general policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, the Eighth Production Team of the Chihu Brigade in the Chihu Commune of Zhangpu County, Fujian Province, has conscientiously summarized its past winter planting experience and comprehensively arranged its winter planting plan. The team's winter planting area will be doubled compared to last year.

Chihu Commune is located in a subtropical area. Traditionally, autumn harvesting begins around "Start of Winter," and sowing and seedling cultivation begins around "Start of Spring," with rice transplanting around the "Vernal Equinox." Due to the short interval between autumn harvest and winter planting, and spring plowing and spring planting, the masses were concerned that more winter planting would affect spring plowing. Therefore, the winter planting area was small in the past, and most of the late rice fields were left fallow in winter. Recently, the team's cadres and members discussed the policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and decided to expand the winter planting area as much as possible to strive for a summer harvest next year that would be better than any previous year. While considering expanding the winter planting area, some team members believed that winter planting in the late rice fields would delay the spring planting season next year. The team's cadres and members conducted extensive discussions on this issue, believing that the contradiction between seizing the season and racing against time could be resolved. After careful calculation, everyone concluded that the growing period of wheat in the local area is generally around ninety days, while early rice transplanting is after the "Vernal Equinox" and before "Pure Brightness." As long as wheat can be planted around "Heavy Snow," there will still be one hundred and five days until the "Vernal Equinox," which is completely sufficient to complete the early rice transplanting before "Pure Brightness." Chen Shucong, a team member from a poor peasant background, cited the fifteen mu of wheat they planted, which had been sown before "Heavy Snow" for the past two years, harvested before "Pure Brightness" the following year, and had never delayed the sowing and transplanting of early rice, sweet potatoes, and peanuts. However, to ensure that the team's winter wheat is planted before "Heavy Snow," a lot of work still needs to be done. For example, a portion of the team's late-maturing late rice, planted with the "Qinggu Dasui" variety, will not be harvested until "Heavy Snow." To ensure that these fields are planted with wheat before "Heavy Snow," it is necessary to strengthen the late-stage management of the autumn fields, process and add fertilizer to promote the early maturity of the late-maturing rice by five to seven days, so as not to miss the wheat planting season. Moreover, wheat cannot be sown on wet land. The field water should be drained about a week before the late rice harvest, and the rice roots should be quickly dug up immediately after harvesting to allow the fields to be quickly sun-dried, so as to facilitate timely plowing and wheat planting.

In order to better resolve the contradiction between expanding winter planting and timely spring planting next year, the Eighth Production Team, while rationally arranging labor and farm work, also conducted a row-by-row survey and comprehensive planning of arable land. Grain will be planted on land suitable for growing grain, and winter crops such as vegetables and green manure will be planted on land unsuitable for growing grain. Among the team's 357 mu of arable land, in addition to the 62 mu occupied by overwintering crops, there are still 295 mu of land that can be used for winter planting. Among them, there are 155 mu of peanut and sweet potato fields, which can now be immediately planted with sweet potatoes, and the yield will be higher than planting wheat. The 98 mu of late rice fields that were traditionally left fallow in winter can all be planted with wheat before "Heavy Snow" this year after making early preparations for harvesting and planting.

    赤湖大队第八生产队总结往年经验全面规划冬种
    全队今年冬种粮食蔬菜绿肥将比去年增加一倍
    本报福州18日电　福建省漳浦县赤湖公社赤湖大队第八生产队，在大办农业、大办粮食方针鼓舞下，认真总结往年冬种经验，全面安排冬种计划，全队冬种面积将比去年扩大一倍。
    赤湖公社地处亚热带地区，历来要到“立冬”前后开始秋收，“立春”前后播种育秧，“春分”前后插秧。由于秋收冬种和春耕春种间隔时间较短，群众顾虑冬种多了影响春耕，因此过去冬种面积较少，晚稻田大都冬闲。最近全队干部和社员们讨论了大办农业、大办粮食的方针，决定尽量扩大冬种面积，争取明年有个比以往任何一年都好的夏收。在酝酿扩大冬种面积时，有些社员认为在晚稻田里搞冬种，会耽误来年春种季节。全队干部、社员对这个问题进行了广泛的讨论，认为抓季节、抢时间矛盾是可以解决的。大家仔细计算的结果是，在当地麦子生长期一般是九十天左右，而早稻插秧是在“春分”后和“清明”前，只要能抓在“大雪”前后种上麦子，到来年“春分”还有一百零五天，完全来得及在“清明”前插完早稻。贫农出身的社员陈树丛举出他们所种的十五亩麦子，两年来都在“大雪”前播种，来年“清明”前收割，早稻、甘薯、花生的播种插秧都没有耽误过。但全队的冬麦要赶在“大雪”前播种，也还要做很多工作，例如队里有一部分“青骨大穗”种的迟熟晚稻，要拖到“大雪”才能收割，要使这些田地在“大雪”前种上麦子，就要抓紧秋田后期管理，加工加肥，促使迟熟稻子提前五到七天成熟，不误种麦季节。而且，麦子不能在湿地上播种，在晚稻收割前一星期左右就要把田水排干，收割后立即抢挖稻根，让田地尽快晒白，以便及时翻犁种麦。
    为了更好地解决扩大冬种和明年适时春种的矛盾，第八生产队在合理安排了劳力、农活同时，还对耕地进行逐丘排队、全面规划，能种粮食的就种粮食，不适宜种粮食的就种蔬菜、绿肥等冬种作物。全队三百五十七亩耕地中，除越冬作物占去六十二亩外，尚有二百九十五亩田地可以冬种，其中有一百五十五亩花生地、番薯地，现在就可马上种上番薯，产量可比种麦子高。过去一贯冬闲的九十八亩晚稻田，今年在提前做好收种准备后，都可以在“大雪”前全部种上麦子。（附图片）
