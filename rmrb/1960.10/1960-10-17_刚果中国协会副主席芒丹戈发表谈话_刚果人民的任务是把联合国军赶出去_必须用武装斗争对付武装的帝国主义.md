Xinhua News Agency, October 16th: Antoine Ligobe Mangdango, Vice Chairman of the Congo-China Association and Editor-in-Chief of "Liberation" Weekly, recently told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "The current task of the Congolese people is to drive the UN troops out of the Congo."

Mangdango severely condemned the imperialism headed by the United States for attempting to control the Congo through the United Nations. He said: "Imperialism is afraid that we will end their monopoly position in the Congo."

Mangdango emphasized: "Imperialism will never easily give up its colonial rule. Imperialism uses force against every one of our struggles. Armed struggle must be used to deal with armed imperialism."

Mangdango said that the Congolese people are completely united on the side of the Lumumba government against the United States. He said that those who are bought by imperialism are only an insignificant minority in the country.

Speaking of his impressions of China, Mangdango said that some progressive journalists said that China's progress constitutes a miracle of the 20th century, "I have seen this miracle, but I am not surprised, because the people of this country have been oppressed by imperialism for many years and urgently demand to change the backwardness of the country as soon as possible and hold their heads high." He said that for Westerners, this is indeed surprising, because the Chinese, who were once considered by them to live in poverty and ignorance, have now achieved such great achievements in politics, economy, and culture, and created things that even Westerners cannot produce.

Mangdango said that China's achievements were achieved under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, after many years of arduous struggle against imperialism and domestic reactionaries.

Speaking of his impressions of the People's Commune, Mangdango said that the People's Commune has improved the living conditions of the entire rural area, brought happiness and well-being to the peasants, and helped to improve the moral standards of the rural masses.

He said: "I personally saw children in nurseries and kindergartens enjoying good treatment that was impossible in the past. School-age children go to school freely, and farmers work in the fields with smiles on their faces. The farmers showed me photos of the broken thatched huts they used to live in, to compare them with their new houses now."

Mangdango said: "I would especially like to emphasize the freedom of the Chinese people. Freedom in China has a different meaning than in the West. The so-called freedom in the West actually loses the factors that constitute freedom. They say that the workers in their countries are free. In reality, due to employment saturation, workers do not know whether they will have work tomorrow. It is completely different in China."

Mangdango said that the Western slanders about the Chinese People's Commune being unfree and forced labor are completely fabricated. He said that they slander in this way because they are helpless in the face of the achievements of the new China and hold resentment in their hearts.

Mangdango also praised China's system of combining education with productive labor.

Mangdango condemned U.S. imperialism for slandering the 650 million Chinese people who are unwilling to be subjected to its aggression as "belligerent." He said that U.S. imperialism barbarously occupies Taiwan, an inseparable part of China's territory, and the United States provoked the war in Korea, attempting to invade China through Korea. It is not China that defeated the aggression of U.S. imperialism that is belligerent, but the United States.

    刚果中国协会副主席芒丹戈发表谈话
    刚果人民的任务是把联合国军赶出去
    必须用武装斗争对付武装的帝国主义
    新华社16日讯　刚果中国协会副主席、“解放”周刊总编辑安托万·利戈贝·芒丹戈最近接见新华社记者时说：“刚果人民目前的任务是要把联合国军从刚果赶出去。”
    芒丹戈严厉谴责以美国为首的帝国主义利用联合国企图控制刚果。他说：“帝国主义害怕我们结束他们在刚果的垄断地位。”
    芒丹戈强调指出：“帝国主义绝对不会轻易放弃其殖民统治。帝国主义对我们每一个斗争都用武力对付。必须用武装斗争来对付武装的帝国主义。”
    芒丹戈说，刚果人民完全一致站在卢蒙巴政府这一边反对美国。他说，那些被帝国主义收买的，在国内只是微不足道的少数。
    在谈到对中国的观感时，芒丹戈说，一些进步的记者说中国的进展构成二十世纪的奇迹，“我看到了这一奇迹，但是并不感到惊奇，因为这个国家的人民多少年来受帝国主义压迫，迫切要求尽快地改变国家的落后面貌，扬眉吐气。”他说，对西方人来说，这确是令人惊奇的，因为过去被他们认为生活在贫困愚昧之中的中国人，现在在政治、经济、文化各方面取得如此大的成就，创造出连西方人都不能生产的东西。
    芒丹戈说，中国的成就是在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，经过多年反帝国主义、反国内反动派的艰苦斗争取得的。
    谈到对人民公社的印象时，芒丹戈说，人民公社改善了整个农村生活的条件，给农民带来愉快、幸福，并有助于提高农村群众的道德水平。
    他说：“我在公社亲眼看到儿童在托儿所、幼儿园享受到过去不可能得到的良好待遇。学龄儿童自由上学校、农民带着微笑在田里耕作。农民拿出照片让我看他们过去住的破茅屋，用来和现在的新房子相比。”
    芒丹戈说：“我特别要强调一下中国人民的自由。自由在中国与西方的意义不一样。西方所谓自由，实际上失去了构成自由的因素。他们说他们国家的工人是自由的。实际上，由于就业饱和状态，工人不知道明天有没有工作。在中国就完全不是这样。”
    芒丹戈说，西方关于中国人民公社不自由、强迫劳动的谰言，完全是假造的。他说，他们如此污蔑，因为对新中国的成就无可奈何，怀恨在心。
    芒丹戈还赞扬了中国的教育与生产劳动相结合的制度。
    芒丹戈谴责美帝国主义把不愿遭受它侵略的六亿五千万中国人民污蔑为“好战”。他说，美帝国主义野蛮地占领中国不可分割的领土台湾，美国在朝鲜挑起战争，企图通过朝鲜侵略中国，好战的不是挫败美帝国主义侵略的中国，而正是美国。
