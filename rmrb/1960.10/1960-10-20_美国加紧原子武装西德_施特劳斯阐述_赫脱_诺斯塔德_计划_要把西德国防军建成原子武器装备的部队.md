Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 18th. The United States and West Germany are intensifying their collusion, plotting under the guise of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to build the revanchist West German Bundeswehr into a force equipped with atomic weapons.

According to Bonn political circles, defense and foreign policy experts from West Germany's ruling Christian Democratic Union held a secret meeting today with West German Defense Minister Strauss, at which Strauss elaborated on a so-called "Heusinger-Norstad Plan" that stipulates equipping North Atlantic Group armies with atomic weapons. According to this plan, the armed forces of the North Atlantic Group, including West Germany, will be built into a so-called "Fourth Atomic Strike Force." This force should be equipped with various U.S. atomic weapons.

Sources say that Strauss and the Christian Democratic Union's defense and foreign policy experts have already agreed to this plan at the meeting.

Strauss clamored for his plan, saying: "Creating a North Atlantic Treaty Organization atomic force will make it possible to quickly form an effective atomic force on the European continent." He also said: "The Atlantic collective is the largest collective in the West, and the European collective can only play a role within the Atlantic collective."

It is reported that Strauss's plan is a development of an earlier plan by Norstad, Supreme Commander of the armed forces of the North Atlantic Group. Norstad had suggested the establishment within the North Atlantic aggressive bloc of a special atomic armed force "composed of U.S., British, and French troops." Norstad outlined his plan in a speech to business leaders in Coventry, England, on October 12, stating that according to this plan, the armies of the North Atlantic Group must be equipped with various atomic weapons. In addition to other equipment, these forces must have submarines capable of carrying "Polaris" atomic missiles and must possess all nuclear weapons launching means to strike designated targets.

According to an article in the West German Social Democratic Party's "News Bulletin" on October 14, Strauss's new plan to establish a "Fourth Atomic Force" was formulated "with the knowledge and agreement of the U.S. government and the Pentagon."

At the same time, West Germany is currently stepping up research into atomic weapons. The central institution of the West German Atomic Research Institute recently held a meeting in Karlsruhe. The chairman of this institution, Winnacker, chairman of Farben, clamored at the meeting that in the Federal Republic, one cannot imagine being without an atomic industry. Bonn Atomic Energy Minister Balke announced that West Germany is studying missiles propelled by atomic energy. It is reported that for this purpose, no fewer than seventy-five research institutions in West Germany are conducting research on atomic technology and atomic physics with the financial support of the Bonn government. In order to implement atomic armament, West Germany is also demanding that the Western European Union relax the tonnage restrictions on its construction of naval vessels.

    美国加紧原子武装西德
    施特劳斯阐述“赫脱——诺斯塔德”计划
    要把西德国防军建成原子武器装备的部队
    新华社波恩18日电　美国和西德正加紧勾结，阴谋在北大西洋公约组织的掩护下，把复仇主义的西德联邦国防军建成为一支用原子武器装备的部队。
    据波恩政界人士说，西德执政党基督教民主党的防务和外交政策专家们今天同西德国防部长施特劳斯举行了一次秘密会议，施特劳斯在会上阐述了一项规定用原子武器装备北大西洋集团军队的所谓“赫脱—诺斯塔德计划”。根据这项计划，北大西洋集团、包括西德在内的武装部队，将被建成为所谓“第四原子打击力量”。这个部队应该装备有美国的各种原子武器。
    消息说，施特劳斯和基督教民主党的防务和外交政策专家在会上已经同意这项计划。
    施特劳斯为他的计划叫嚣说：“创建一支北大西洋公约组织原子力量，将使得能够在欧洲大陆上迅速组成一支有效的原子力量。”他还说：“大西洋集体是西方最大的集体，欧洲集体只有在大西洋集体的范围内才能起作用。”
    据报道，施特劳斯的这项计划是北大西洋集团武装部队总司令诺斯塔德的早先一个计划的发展。诺斯塔德曾经建议在北大西洋侵略集团内成立一支“由美、英、法部队组成的”特别原子武装部队。诺斯塔德10月12日在英国考文垂对商界人士讲话时阐述他的计划说，根据这项计划，北大西洋集团的军队必须要以各种原子武器装备起来。这些部队除了其他装备外要有能携带“北极星式”原子导弹的潜艇，并且必需拥有一切核武器的发射工具以打击指定的目标。
    据西德社会民主党“新闻公报”10月14日的一篇文章说，施特劳斯的建立“第四原子力量”的新计划是在“美国政府和五角大楼知道和同意之下制订的”。
    同时，西德目前正在加紧原子武器的研究。西德原子研究所的中央机构最近在卡尔斯卢厄举行了一次会议。这个机构的主席、法本公司董事长温纳克尔在会上叫嚷说，在联邦共和国里，人们不能够设想没有原子工业。波恩原子能部长巴耳克宣布说，西德正在研究用原子能作推力的导弹。据报道，为了这个目的，西德大约有不少于七十五个研究机构正在波恩政府的财政支持下进行原子技术和原子物理学的研究。为了实行原子武装，西德还正在要求西欧联盟放宽对它建造海军舰只的吨位限制。
