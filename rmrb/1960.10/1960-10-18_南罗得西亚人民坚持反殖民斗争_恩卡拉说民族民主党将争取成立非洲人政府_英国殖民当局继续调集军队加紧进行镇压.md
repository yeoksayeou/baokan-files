Xinhua News Agency, October 16th, Salisbury Dispatch: Nkomo, Secretary-General of the National Democratic Party of Southern Rhodesia, condemned the colonial authorities on the 15th for attempting to intimidate Africans with troops and predicted the banning of the National Democratic Party. He said that the National Democratic Party would use "any means to establish an African government in Rhodesia." He also said, "We want a government democratically elected by the people of this country, and no one can stop us."

In order to strengthen its colonial rule, the British colonial authorities in Southern Rhodesia have recently deployed a large number of troops and police to Salisbury and other places to brutally suppress the Southern Rhodesian people's struggle against colonialism. On the 14th, the colonial authorities also issued an order prohibiting all public gatherings and attempted to ban the National Democratic Party, which is supported by the people of Southern Rhodesia.

These actions by the British colonialists have aroused fierce protests from the people of Southern Rhodesia. An article in the British "Financial Times" on the 12th had to admit that British colonial rule in Southern Rhodesia was facing a "dead end," and that Whitehead, the "Prime Minister" of the British colonial authorities in Southern Rhodesia, had a "notorious reputation." The newspaper said that this "Prime Minister" gave a speech in Highfield Township in July, but was met with fierce opposition from Africans, so that he had to "escape through the window." The newspaper also admitted that the people of Southern Rhodesia were extremely poor, and although European colonists had two thousand empty houses, the African towns were "overcrowded," and the African people were struggling against various forms of oppression. According to the newspaper, even Whitehead had to "admit privately" that the country's colonial rule was "in a desperate situation." However, this "Prime Minister," who relies on a huge army and police force to maintain brutal rule, clamored that his primary task "is to destroy any chaos."

    南罗得西亚人民坚持反殖民斗争
    恩卡拉说民族民主党将争取成立非洲人政府
    英国殖民当局继续调集军队加紧进行镇压
    新华社16日讯　索尔兹伯里消息：南罗得西亚民族民主党总书记恩卡拉15日谴责殖民当局企图用军队威吓非洲人，并预示要取缔民族民主党。他说，民族民主党将使用“任何手段在罗得西亚成立非洲人政府”。他还说，“我们希望有一个由这个国家的人民民主选举的政府，谁也阻拦不了我们。”
    南罗得西亚的英国殖民当局为了加强殖民统治，最近调集大批军警到索耳兹伯里等地，残酷镇压南罗得西亚人民反对殖民主义的斗争。殖民当局在14日还发布了禁止一切公众集会的命令，并且企图取缔受到南罗得西亚人民支持的民族民主党。
    英国殖民者的这些行动激起了南罗得西亚人民激烈的抗议。英国“金融时报”12日发表的一篇文章中也不得不承认，英国在南罗得西亚的殖民统治已面临“绝境”，英国在南罗得西亚的殖民当局“总理”怀特赫德“声名狼借”。这家报纸说，这个“总理”在7月间到海非耳德镇发表演说，但是遭到非洲人的激烈反对，以致不得不“从窗口逃走”。报纸还承认南罗德西亚人民极端贫困，尽管欧洲殖民者有两千所空房，但非洲人市镇却“拥挤不堪”，非洲人民身受种种压迫而起来斗争。据报纸说，连怀特赫德也不得不“私下承认”这个国家的殖民统治“处于绝望的困境”。但是这个依靠庞大的军队警察维持残暴统治的“总理”叫嚷说，他的首要任务“是摧毁任何混乱”。
