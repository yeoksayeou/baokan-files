    The Motherland Needs Millions of Hou Tingrens

    Look, in Zhuxi County, Hubei Province, mountain after mountain, originally barren and uninhabited, haunted by wild animals, and considered "poor mountains and bad waters with no future," have been transformed by Hou Tingren in just a few years into "gold and silver mountains" with abundant grain, thriving livestock, and an inexhaustible supply of medicinal herbs and special products.

    In our vast and expansive motherland, there are abundant natural resources, countless underground treasures, and barren mountains and wild ridges that can be turned into "gold and silver mountains." This is not unique to Zhuxi County in Hubei Province. The heroes needed to transform natural treasures into the social wealth of the motherland are not just one Hou Tingren, but millions of good comrades like Hou Tingren. Look at the deep mountains and old forests bordering Hubei and Sichuan, densely growing tall pines, firs, and birches, as well as chestnuts, walnuts, water pears, starfruit, and various medicinal herbs such as eucommia and angelica. In the mountains and forests, clear springs gurgle, and black oily soil is several feet thick. Leaves and wild fruits grow and fall, covering the ground with a layer more than a foot thick. How rich are the natural resources hidden here, how beautiful the natural scenery! And these are just some of the wild plants visible above ground. There are also wild animals, underground treasures, and so on. How many people are needed to develop and manage this! Millions of Hou Tingrens are needed in the mountains and old forests; the great motherland needs them.

    Now, Hou Tingren has spent several years developing a portion of the mountains in Zhuxi County. Thousands more heroes and good men in Zhuxi County have followed Hou Tingren into the deep mountains and old forests. Carrying luggage and tools, they are competing to settle down in the deep mountains and dense forests. In the near future, we will see how many more "Treasure Mountains" and "Gold and Silver Mountains" will be developed!

    Hou Tingren is a good comrade and good son/daughter of the Party. He listened to the correct direction and working methods indicated by the Party, established the ambitious goal of developing barren mountains and wild ridges, relied on self-reliance and the masses of peasants, and built a large-scale comprehensive farm in the desolate mountainous area. Hou Tingren has become a glorious example of building mountainous areas, attracting many young men and women to go up the mountains to extract "treasure."

    Do people want to experience the spirit of overcoming difficulties and building the country with diligence and thrift? Hou Tingren's approach is worth learning. As everyone knows, there is a Wang Guofan in Hebei Province, who promoted the spirit of "poor sticks" and used three and a half donkey legs to rapidly develop the production of the agricultural cooperative. When Hou Tingren went to transform those mountains, he didn't even bring a hoe, just himself and his two hands. He resolutely listened to the Party's words and created outstanding achievements. In the practical struggle of building the mountainous area, he deeply realized the truth that "socialism is built by people, not bought with money." Once he grasped this truth, Hou Tingren gained infinite wisdom and strength. He and his comrades who developed the mountainous area had the great ambition to "develop all the mountains that no one has developed, and manage all the old forests that no one has managed," relying on the masses, working hard, running the farm diligently and thriftily, overcoming various difficulties, and growing from one person to more than nine hundred people, establishing a comprehensive farm with agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and side occupations, as well as more than a dozen factories. Moreover, he trained and cultivated a group of backbones for building the mountainous area. A fourteen- or fifteen-year-old cattle herder, after being trained through labor and life here, can lead a few people, find a mountain forest, and establish a comprehensive farm with nearly a hundred people. A young girl who had not been away from school for long, after coming here, can "establish great ambitions at a young age," develop a piece of land, and grow densely planted and high-yielding medicinal herbs.

    Let us learn and carry forward Hou Tingren's spirit of working hard, overcoming difficulties, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift, and completely change our country's "poor and blank" face!

    Let us learn from Hou Tingren's rich experience in building mountainous areas and turn barren mountains and wild ridges into "Treasure Mountains" and "Gold and Silver Mountains"!

    祖国需要千百万个侯廷仁
    请看，湖北竹溪县的一座座山头，原来是荒无人烟，野兽出没，被人认为是“穷山恶水没奔头”的荒山野岭，一到侯廷仁手下，只几年工夫，却转眼变成了粮食丰足，六畜兴旺，药材、特产等各种财宝取之不尽的“金银山”。
    在我们辽阔广大的祖国土地上，蕴藏着丰富的自然资源、无穷的地下宝藏而能够变为“金银山”的荒山野岭，不只是湖北竹溪县一个县有，需要去把自然宝藏变成祖国社会财富的英雄，也不能只是一个侯廷仁，而是千百万个像侯廷仁一样的党的好同志。你看，那在湖北和四川边界的深山老林里，密密生长着高大的松、杉和桦树，还有栗子、核桃、水梨、洋桃各种果木和杜仲、当归各色各样的药材。山林里，清清的泉水哗哗流，黑黑的油土几尺厚。树叶、野果结了落，落了结，在地面铺上尺多厚。这里蕴藏着多么丰富的自然资源，这里有着多么美丽的自然景色。这还只是地面上能够看到的一些野生植物呢，还有野生动物，还有地下宝藏等等；这需要多少人去开发，多少人去经营啊！千百万个侯廷仁，到山区去，到老林去，都是伟大祖国所需要的。
    现在，侯廷仁用了几年的时间，把竹溪县的一部分山头开发了；竹溪县继侯廷仁到深山老林去的英雄好汉们又有成千上万了。他们背着行李，带着工具，争先到深山密林去安家落户。在不久的将来，又可以看到有多少座“万宝山”“金银山”被开发出来啊！
    侯廷仁是党的好同志、好儿女，听了党所指示的正确方向和工作方法，树立了开发荒山野岭的雄心壮志，依靠自力更生，依靠农民群众，把荒凉的山区建成了大规模的综合农场。侯廷仁成了建设山区的光荣榜样，吸引了多少青年男女上山取“宝”。
    人们要想体会战胜困难，勤俭建国的精神吗？侯廷仁的作法，就很值得学习。大家知道，河北省有个王国藩，他发扬“穷棒子”精神，曾经用三条半驴腿，使农业社的生产迅速发展起来。侯廷仁去改造那些大山，甚至连一把镢头也没有带，就只是他一个人，两只手。他坚决听党的话，创造了优异的成绩。他在建设山区的实践斗争中，深深体会到“社会主义是人建设的，不是钱买的”这条真理。一旦掌握了这条真理，侯廷仁便增长了无限的智慧和力量。他和开发山区的同志们抱有“凡是没人开发的大山，都想开发。凡是没人经营的老林，都想经营。”的气吞山河的伟大气魄，雄心壮志，依靠群众，艰苦奋斗，勤俭办场，战胜了种种困难，从一个人发展到了九百多人，办起了农、林、牧、副的综合农场和十几个工厂。而且锻炼和培养出了一批建设山区的骨干。十四五岁的放牛娃，经过这里劳动生活的锻炼，就能够带上几个人，找到一块山林，办起了一个近百人的综合农场。离开学校不久的小姑娘，来到这里，就能够“人小立大志”，开发一片土地，种出密植高产的药材。
    让我们学习和发扬侯廷仁埋头苦干、战胜困难、勤俭办一切事业的精神，彻底改变我们国家“一穷二白”的面貌吧！
    让我们学习侯廷仁建设山区的丰富经验，把一座座的荒山野岭变成“万宝山”“金银山”吧！
