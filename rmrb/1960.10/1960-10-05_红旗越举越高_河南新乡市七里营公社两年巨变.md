    The Red Flag is Raised Higher and Higher
    ——Tremendous Changes in the Qiliying People's Commune, Xinxiang City, Henan Province in Two Years
    By Our Correspondents Yang Guobao and Our Reporter Yuan Mu
    If the newly established people's commune two years ago was like a red sun just rising above the horizon, then now it is the rising sun of the East, radiating the light of ten thousand zhang across the land. Like all rural people's communes across the country, the tremendous achievements made by the Qiliying People's Commune in Xinxiang City, Henan Province over the past two years or more increasingly demonstrate the infinite vitality and great future of the people's commune system.
    As soon as the Qiliying Commune was established, more than 60,000 members joyfully welcomed their unforgettable moment of happiness: On August 6, 1958, the third day after the commune was officially named, the beloved great leader Chairman Mao came here. During his inspection, Chairman Mao praised the cadres and members here, saying: "The name 'People's Commune' is good!" "There is great hope!" Chairman Mao's care and encouragement became a huge driving force for all members to resolutely achieve a comprehensive Great Leap Forward every year. They said: "Chairman Mao personally planted the red flag of 'People's Commune is Good' in our commune, and we guarantee to raise this red flag higher and higher."
          Strong Grass is Known in a High Wind
    The young commune initially faced severe tests in overcoming extraordinary drought and insect pests. The successive years of bumper harvests of grain and cotton here were seized from the jaws of nature. Following the bumper harvest of 1958, from the summer of 1959 to the summer of this year, Qiliying, a major economic crop area producing cotton, like most parts of Henan Province, experienced an unprecedentedly severe drought – no thorough rain for more than 300 consecutive days. However, the vast number of members, relying on the great collective strength of the people's commune, conscientiously implemented the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, and fully carried forward the heroic spirit of "fighting drought until the sky lowers its head," and still achieved a bumper harvest. In 1958, the total grain output of the entire commune increased by 17% compared to 1957, and by two and a half times compared to the highest annual output before liberation; the total cotton output increased by 45.8% compared to 1957, and by 3.24 times compared to the highest annual output before liberation. In 1959, when a bumper harvest was achieved despite the extraordinary drought and insect pests, the total grain and cotton output still increased slightly compared to 1958.
    This year, although the severe drought has continued relentlessly from 1959, no traces of disaster have been left on the 150,000 mu of cultivated land in the entire commune. During the current autumn harvest season, the vast fields are a sea of cotton, with fluffy flowers like snow, and the golden grains are full and plump, with joyful crowds everywhere.
    Strong grass is known in a high wind, and plains are not apparent without high mountains. If you don't believe it, please look at this clear comparison:
    In 1943, Henan Province suffered a major drought. At that time, the land was truly desolate, starvation was rampant, and countless people fled to other places, with wives and children separated. The drought in the area now under the jurisdiction of the Qiliying Commune, although far less severe than the drought from last year to this year, still resulted in the starvation and death of more than 2,300 people.
    Why can the people's commune withstand seemingly irresistible natural disasters? This is because the vast number of members fully recognize and grasp the superiority of the people's commune's "large size and high degree of public ownership," hold high the red flag of continuous revolution, and give full play to human subjective initiative. In the struggle against natural disasters, they have greatly accelerated the pace of agricultural modernization, surpassing in two years the road that would have taken ten or even decades to travel in the past. Our heroic members did not lose heart, grieve, or weep in the face of disaster; on the contrary, they strode forward with their heads held high, determined to become stronger. The heroic slogan they put forward was: "Rely on the Party and rely on the people, don't rely on the heavens, be determined to conquer nature, and ensure that disaster years are turned into bumper years, even if it doesn't rain for three years."
          Ten Thousand Waters Return to the Fields to Nurture Seedlings
    The heroic spirit of the vast number of members is first and foremost concentrated in the bold achievement of quickly realizing advanced water conservancy throughout the commune. The Qiliying area is the central area for Yellow River irrigation, with the main irrigation canal traversing the entire commune. Preliminary water conservancy was achieved before communization, but before communization, due to the small size of agricultural cooperatives and dispersed land, irrigation canals could not be uniformly repaired and used, often causing water loss upstream and water shortage downstream. During droughts, there was competition and grabbing of water, and the engineering benefits could not be fully realized. During floods, there was digging and blocking, causing floods and relocation. After communization, the commune Party committee immediately formulated a unified water conservancy plan for the entire commune, using the winter slack season to organize a water conservancy construction army of nearly 10,000 people, under unified leadership, unified action, and comprehensive collaboration, engaging in large-scale battles. In the freezing cold of ten degrees below zero, they braved the biting cold wind to dig rivers on the ice. After two years of hard work, they repaired and dredged more than 3,000 original crooked and unsmooth rivers, and newly dug 32 irrigation rivers and 28 drainage rivers, realizing self-flowing irrigation and a river network for all cultivated land. In particular, the commune accepted the experience of reduced Yellow River water volume during the severe drought of 1959, and organized professional teams to dig machine wells and large pits and ponds on a large scale last winter and this spring, further enabling more than half of the commune's cultivated land to achieve "double insurance of wells and rivers," further realizing the advanced water conservancy goal of "no disasters from heavy rain for a hundred days, and guaranteed bumper harvests without rain all year round."
    The hard work of the past two years has shown its tremendous power in the continuous extraordinary droughts of 1959 and 1960. In the arduous struggle against drought, an anti-drought army of 20,000 members was formed, so that streams of river water, well water, pit water, and pond water were tamely flowing into the fields, nurturing the seedlings.
          The Pace of Mechanization Accelerates
    Relying on state support and the mass technical innovation movement, the process of agricultural mechanization has also greatly accelerated after communization. Agricultural cooperatives were weak and difficult to achieve mechanization; dispersed land management made it difficult to exert mechanical efficiency; and without commune-run industry, the repair and matching of agricultural machinery and other problems could not be solved, but after communization, these problems were readily solved. Over the past two years, the commune has used commune-owned funds and public accumulation provided by various production brigades to newly purchase 28.3 standard units of tractors. In addition to the tractors transferred to the commune by the state-owned tractor station after communization, the commune now has 40.6 standard units of tractors. In addition, 107 units of modern agricultural machinery such as combine harvesters, grain threshers, and seeders have been newly purchased in the past two years. Now, the area of mechanized cultivation in the entire commune has increased from 25% before communization to 82%; the degree of mechanization in major field operations such as plowing, harrowing, sowing, inter-tillage, pest control, and drainage and irrigation has also reached 35%. While relying on modern agricultural machinery to accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization, the commune has also relied on the strength of commune-run industry and the mass tool reform movement in the past two years, creating a total of 349 kinds of new agricultural tools, totaling 71,172 pieces, and imitating 146,890 pieces of new agricultural tools, greatly accelerating the realization of semi-mechanization of field operations. At present, in addition to owning a large number of modern agricultural machinery, the entire commune has an average of one weeding hoe for every 35 mu of land, one pest control machine for every 25 mu of land, and the number of new-style waterwheels has increased more than twofold compared to before communization. Field transportation has been realized with rubber tires, and the phenomenon of carrying on shoulders has been basically eliminated.
    The rapid development of agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization has further improved the level of agricultural production and the drought resistance capacity of the people's commune. Because mechanization and semi-mechanization have replaced many heavy labor tasks, 886,000 labor days and 1,180,000 animal labor days have been saved in the past two years, making it possible to draw out more labor to strengthen drought fighting and field management. The large-scale digging of power drainage and irrigation machinery and the comprehensive utilization of tractors have directly exerted tremendous power in drought resistance. Before communization, the depth of plowing here averaged 12 to 15 centimeters, but now it has been increased to 24 to 32 centimeters; in the past, the land was harrowed at most four to five times, but now it has been increased to seven to twelve times; in the past, cotton fields were generally only inter-tilled six times, but now they are inter-tilled eight to fourteen times. This year, because 70% of the commune's 90,000 mu of cotton was cultivated by machinery, the sowing time was shortened by two-thirds compared to previous years; in cotton field management, the entire commune can now inter-till, control pests, and topdress once every three days.
    The water conservancy and mechanization of agriculture are carried out in conjunction with the large-scale development of high-yield fields and gardenization, and with the comprehensive reform of the cultivation system. The ten mu of "Red Flag" cadre cotton experimental fields that Chairman Mao visited here in 1958 have now been expanded into 12,000 mu of "Red Flag" high-yield cotton fields, and are connected to five other high-yield fields, with a total area of 82,000 mu, accounting for 91% of the commune's 90,000 mu of cotton fields. This large-scale high-yield field, after the hard work and careful management of the vast number of cadres and members, has truly reached the gardenization standard of "land as flat as a mirror, soil as fine as flour, edges as neat as a cut, and ridges as straight as a line." In each high-yield field, there are also 2,000 mu of high-yield field command fields, where dozens of agricultural science and technology projects are being tested, including sowing time, density, varieties, irrigation volume, fertilization volume, as well as artificial rainfall, underground irrigation, and underground heating. They are the model for driving the comprehensive implementation of the Eight-Character Charter in the entire high-yield field, and also the red and expert schools for improving the ideological level, management level, and production technical level of the vast number of cadres.
        Commune-Run Industry Serves Agriculture Better
    Under the guidance of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, commune-run industry is serving agriculture better and promoting the modernization of agriculture. After two years of development, rectification, consolidation and improvement, commune-run industry now has 83 various factories, including 12 commune-run factories and 71 team-run factories. In 1958, the total output value of commune-run industry was only 240,000 yuan, which increased to 800,000 yuan in 1959, and reached 4,240,000 yuan from January to August this year. Of the total industrial output value this year, products directly serving agricultural production accounted for 85%. The First Machinery Factory, which was established in 1958 during the mass movement to popularize ball bearings after the establishment of the commune, had only two baking furnaces and a few hammers at that time, but has now become a factory with casting, forging, machining, fitter, and carpentry workshops. Since the beginning of this year, this factory has created and repaired 210,000 pieces of various agricultural machinery and tools for the entire commune. At the same time, they also undertake the heavy task of repairing and matching parts for tractor stations and drainage and irrigation machinery teams. A fertilizer factory established in early 1959 split off a complete team including the factory director, workshop director and more than 40 workers at the beginning of this year to establish another fertilizer factory. This pair of "mother and son" factories has produced 4,200 tons of local fertilizer this year. The 12 team-run grain processing factories have enabled the mechanization or semi-mechanization of grain processing in most of the public canteens in the commune, saving a lot of labor and animal power. The sewing factories, shoe factories, etc. of the major brigades not only further socialized housework and liberated more female labor, but also further promoted the collective spirit and communist consciousness of the vast number of commune members. All commune-run factories, in accordance with the spirit of "doing more during slack periods, doing less during busy periods, and stopping during the busiest periods," draw out part or all of their manpower to invest in the front line of agricultural production during the busy season of field labor and the most intense time of drought fighting, and also help production teams to repair agricultural tools.
          All Undertakings Leap Forward Comprehensively
    On the premise of first ensuring the increase of grain and cotton production and the labor required for field work, under the unified leadership and unified plan of the commune, diversified economies such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have developed rapidly, achieving a comprehensive leap forward. In just two short years, the entire commune has planted more than 744,000 various economic trees, and planted more than 900 mu of fruit trees such as apple pears, peaches, and apricots, an increase of more than threefold compared to before communization. The number of large livestock such as cattle, horses, mules, and donkeys has increased by 22% compared to before communization. The number of pigs and sheep has increased by more than 50% respectively. In 1959, the total income of diversified management in the entire commune was 797,700 yuan, an increase of 48% compared to 1957 before communization, and by the end of August this year, it had already reached 794,481 yuan.
    The comprehensive leap forward in all production undertakings has also brought about a great development of collective welfare undertakings and cultural and educational undertakings, ensuring the gradual improvement of members' lives: public canteens are getting better and better, and 99.7% of members, except for a very few patients, have joined the canteens. Every village has kindergartens and nurseries, lonely and helpless elderly people spend their happy old age in homes for the elderly, and maternity hospitals receive every pregnant woman about to give birth. Five middle schools and 43 primary schools implementing the half-work half-study system are cultivating more than 3,700 young people and all school-age children in the commune, and 43 spare-time red and expert schools are continuing to improve the political, cultural, and technical levels of the male and female members who have just shed their illiteracy hats. A learning atmosphere has become popular. The commune's book sales station sold more than 410,000 books last year, and 32,000 single copies of Chairman Mao's works were snapped up during the learning upsurge that appeared this spring. Since communization, all members have enjoyed the most fundamental social insurance of eating without money. In 1958, the net income of members increased by 28% compared to 1957, and by 8.7% in 1959 compared to 1958, and there will be more growth this year.

    红旗越举越高
    ——河南新乡市七里营公社两年巨变
    本报通讯员　杨国保　本报记者　袁木
    如果说，两年前新生的人民公社还是刚升出地平线的一轮红日，那么现在它已经是升起的东方朝阳，放射着普照大地的万丈光芒。同全国所有的农村人民公社一样，河南省新乡市七里营人民公社成立两年多来所取得的巨大成就，越来越充分地显示出人民公社制度的无限生命力和伟大前途。
    七里营公社一成立，六万多名社员就欢欣鼓舞地迎接了他们永远难忘的幸福时刻：1958年8月6日，公社正式命名后的第三天，全国人民敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席来到了这里。毛主席在视察中曾经赞扬这里的干部和社员们说：“人民公社这个名字好！”“大有希望！”毛主席的关怀和鼓舞，成了全体社员决心实现年年全面大跃进的巨大动力。他们说：“毛主席在咱们公社亲手插下了‘人民公社好’这杆红旗，咱们保证要把这杆红旗越举越高。”
          疾风知劲草
    年青的公社一开始就在战胜特大的旱、虫灾害中接受了严峻的考验。这里连年的粮棉丰收是从大自然的虎口中夺取来的。继1958年的丰收之后，从1959年的夏季到今年的夏季，七里营这个盛产棉花的经济作物区，同河南全省大部地区一样，经历了历史上空前特大旱灾的袭击——连续三百多天没下透雨。但是，广大社员凭仗着人民公社这个巨大的集体力量，认真贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针，充分发扬“抗旱抗到天低头”的英雄气概，仍然夺得了丰收。1958年，全公社粮食总产量比1957年增长17％，比解放前最高年产量增长二倍半；棉花总产量，比1957年增长45.8％，比解放前最高年产量增长三点二四倍。在特大旱、虫灾害袭击下夺得丰收的1959年，粮棉总产量仍然比1958年略有增产。
    今年，虽然严重的旱灾从1959年一直无情的延续下来，但是，全公社十五万亩耕地上并没有留下灾害的痕迹。在目前的秋收季节里，辽阔无边的田野上棉花似海，花絮如雪，金色的谷物穗大粒满，到处是欢乐的人群。
    疾风知劲草，不见高山不显平地。不信，请看这个显明的对比：
    1943年，河南大旱。那时真是赤地千里，饿殍遍野，无数人逃荒异乡，妻离子散。七里营公社现在所管辖的地区，那一年的旱情，虽然远远不及去年到今年的旱情严重，可是饿死病死的就有二千三百多人。
    为什么人民公社能够顶得住看来是无法抗拒的自然灾害？这是因为广大社员充分认识并且掌握了人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，高举不断革命的红旗，发挥人的主观能动性，在同自然灾害的斗争中大大加快了农业现代化的步伐，两年中就超过了过去十年甚至几十年才能走过的路程。我们的英雄社员们在灾害面前丝毫也不垂头丧气、悲哀泪泣；相反的是昂首阔步、发愤图强，他们相信自己的力量。他们提出的豪迈口号是：“靠党靠人不靠天，立志征服大自然，任凭三年不下雨，定让灾年变丰年。”
          万水归田哺育禾苗
    广大社员的英雄气概，首先集中表现在尽快实现全社高级水利化的豪迈业绩中，七里营地区是引黄灌溉的中心地带，引黄总灌渠横贯全社，公社化前就实现了初步的水利化，但是在公社化前，由于农业社规模小、土地分散，灌溉渠道不能统一修整和使用，常常引起上游跑水，下游缺水，旱时争水抢水，工程效益不能充分发挥，涝时上扒下堵，造成水灾搬家。公社化后，公社党委立即制订出全社统一的水利规划，利用冬闲季节，组织近万人的水利建设大军，统一领导，统一行动，全面协作，大兵团作战，在零下十度的冰天雪地里，冒着刺骨的寒风踏冰挖河，经过两年奋战，整修和疏通了原有三千多条弯曲不畅的大小河道，新挖了三十二条灌河和二十八条排河，实现了全部耕地的自流灌溉和河网化。特别是公社接受1959年大旱年中黄河水量减少的经验，在去冬今春组织专业队大打机井，大挖坑塘，更使得公社半数以上的耕地达到了“井河双保险”，进一步实现了“百日大雨不成灾，终年无雨保丰收”的高级水利化目标。
    两年来的辛勤劳动，在1959年和1960年两年连续的特大旱灾中，显示出来了巨大威力。在艰苦的抗旱斗争中，由两万社员组成了抗旱大军，使一股一股的河水、井水、坑水、塘水，都驯服地流进田野，哺育着禾苗。
          机械化进度加快
    依靠国家的支援和群众性的技术革新运动，农业机械化的进程也在公社化以后大大地加快了。农业社力量单薄难以实现机械化；土地分散经营不易发挥机械效能；没有社办工业不能解决农业机械的修配等问题，在公社化后都迎刃而解。两年来，公社利用社有经济和各个生产大队提供的公共积累，新购置了拖拉机二十八点三个标准台，加上公社化后国营拖拉机站下放给公社的拖拉机，公社现在已拥有拖拉机四十点六个标准台。此外，两年来还新购置了联合收割机、谷物脱粒机、播种机等现代农业机械一百零七台。现在，全社机耕面积已由公社化前的25％提高到82％；在耕、耙、播、中耕、治虫、排灌等主要田间作业方面，机械化程度也已达到35％。在依靠现代农业机械加快实现农业机械化的同时，两年来还依靠社办工业的力量和群众性的工具改革运动，共创造出各种新式农具三百四十九种，共七万一千一百七十二件，仿制新式农具十四万六千八百九十件，大大加快实现田间作业的半机械化。目前，全社除拥有一大批现代化农业机械外，平均每三十五亩地有一部耘锄，二十五亩地有一部治虫药械，新式水车较公社化前增加了两倍多，田间运输已经实现了胶轮化，基本消灭了人抬肩挑的现象。
    农业机械化半机械化的迅速发展，进一步提高了农业生产的水平和人民公社的抗旱能力。由于机械化半机械化代替了许多笨重劳动，两年来共节省出八十八万六千个劳动日和一百十八万个畜工，这就有可能抽出更多的劳力加强抗旱斗争和田间管理。大挖动力排灌机械和拖拉机的综合利用，在抗旱中直接发挥了巨大威力。公社化前这里耕地的深度平均十二到十五厘米，现在已提高到二十四到三十二厘米；过去耙地最多四至五遍，现在已增加到七至十二遍；过去棉田一般只中耕六次，现在中耕八到十四次。今年公社九万亩棉花因为70％实行机耕，播种时间比往年缩短三分之二；在棉田管理中，现在全社三天内就可以中耕、治虫、追肥各一遍。
    农业的水利化和机械化，是同大搞丰产方和园田化，是同全面改革耕作制度结合着进行的。1958年毛主席来这里时参观过的十亩“红旗”干部棉花试验田，现在已经扩展成为一万二千亩“红旗”棉花丰产方，并且同其他五个丰产方阡陌相连，总面积达八万二千亩，占全社九万亩棉田的91％。这样大规模的丰产方，经过广大干部和社员的辛勤劳动和精心经营，真正达到了“地平如镜，土碎如面，边齐如裁，埂直如线”园田化标准。在各个丰产方里，还分布有两千亩丰产方指挥田，那里进行的有播种时间、密度、品种、浇水量、施肥量以及人工降雨、地下灌溉、地下加温等几十种农业科学技术项目的试验。它们是带动整个丰产方全面贯彻八字宪法的样板，也是提高广大干部的思想水平、管理水平和生产技术水平的红专学校。
        社办工业更好地为农业服务
    在以农业为基础这个方针的指导下，社办工业正在更好地服务农业，推进了农业的现代化。社办工业经过两年来的发展、整顿巩固和提高，全社现有各种工厂八十三个，其中社营的十二个，队营七十一个。1958年社办工业的总产值只有二十四万元，1959年增加到八十万元，今年的1至8月份就达到了四百二十四万元。而在今年的全部工业总产值中，直接为农业生产服务的产品就占了85％。1958年，在公社成立后大搞滚珠轴承化运动中建立起来的第一机械厂，当时全部设备只有两部烘炉和几把锤子，现在已经成为拥有铸工、锻工、车工、钳工、木工等车间的工厂了。今年以来，这个工厂已经为全公社创造和修理各种农业机具二十一万件。同时，他们还担负了为拖拉机站和排灌机械队等修配部件的繁重任务。1959年初建立的一座化肥厂，今年初又分出了包括厂长、车间主任和四十多个工人的全套人马，另建立一个化肥厂。这一对“母子”工厂，今年已经生产出土化肥四千二百吨。十二个队办的粮食加工厂，使得全社大部公共食堂的吃粮加工实现了机械化或半机械化，节省了大量的劳动力和畜力，各大队的缝纫厂、制鞋厂等，不仅进一步使家务劳动社会化，解放了更多的妇女劳动力，并且进一步促进了广大社员集体主义思想和共产主义觉悟的提高。所有的社办工厂，根据“闲时大办，忙时少办，大忙停办”的精神，在田间劳动的繁忙季节和抗旱斗争最紧张的时候，抽出部分或全部人力，投入农业生产的第一线，并且帮助各生产队检修农具。
          各项事业全面跃进
    在首先保证粮棉增产和田间劳动所需要劳力的条件下，根据公社的统一领导和统一计划，林牧副渔等多种经济迅速发展，实现了全面跃进。在短短的两年中，全社已种植各种经济林七十四万四千多株，种植苹果梨、桃、杏等果树九百多亩，比公社化前增长三倍多。牛、马、骡、驴等大家畜比公社化前增长22％。猪、羊分别增长50％以上。1959年全公社多种经营的总收入是七十九万七千元，比公社化以前的1957年增加48％，而今年到8月底止，就已经收入了七十九万四千四百八十一元。
    各项生产事业的全面跃进，也带来了集体福利事业和文化教育事业的大发展，保证了社员生活的逐步提高：公共食堂越办越好，全社除极个别的病人外，99.7％社员参加了食堂。村村都有幼儿园、托儿所，孤弱无家的老人在敬老院度着幸福的晚年，妇产院接待着每一个临产的孕妇。五所实行半耕半读制度的中学和四十三所小学，培育着三千七百多个青少年和全社学龄儿童，四十三个业余红专学校，正继续提高刚脱掉文盲帽子的男女社员的政治、文化和技术水平。学习空气蔚然成风，公社售书站去年售书量达到了四十一万多册，三万二千册毛主席著作的单行本，在今春出现的学习高潮中便抢购一空。公社化以来，全体社员们就享受着吃饭不要钱这一项最根本的社会保险，1958年社员纯收入比1957年增加了28％，1959年比1958年增加了8.7％，今年还将有更多的增长。
