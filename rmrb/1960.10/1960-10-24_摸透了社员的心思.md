    Guessed the Commune Members' Thoughts
    One evening, commune member He Laoliu dragged his plow crutch, shouldered his rake, and herded his old ox back from the fields. At the entrance of the animal raising area, he ran into Sun Shunde, a salesman from the Sanquan Supply and Marketing Cooperative branch in Houma, Shanxi. The two chatted for a while, and Xiao Sun noticed that the rake He Laoliu was carrying on his shoulder was missing three teeth. He thought: Half a month ago, I had checked the teams one by one and replaced all the rakes and plowshares with missing teeth, so why is He Laoliu's rake still missing teeth? Later, he realized that this area is a semi-mountainous area with many small stones in the fields, so the rake teeth are easily broken. He should quickly help the commune solve this problem.
    The salesman's sense of responsibility prompted Xiao Sun to return to the branch store without eating dinner, load a flatbed cart with rake teeth and plowshares, and pull it to the commune. On the way, he ran into He Laoliu again. It turned out that Laoliu had eaten and was about to talk to the team leader about the rake teeth. Xiao Sun knew that he was going to ask for rake teeth, so he said, "Uncle, don't worry, the rake teeth have been delivered to you." Laoliu was surprised and said, "How did you guess my thoughts?" Xiao Sun told him what he had seen and thought, and He Laoliu praised him repeatedly.
    That night, Xiao Sun delivered seventy plowshares and more than two thousand rake teeth to various production teams. (Shi Hua, Jing Xian, Mo Lin)

    摸透了社员的心思
    一天傍晚，社员贺老六拖着犁拐，肩扛着耙，吆喝着老黄牛从田间回来。在饲养处的门口，和山西侯马三泉供销分店的营业员孙顺德打了个照面。两个人聊了一会儿，小孙发现老六肩上扛着的耙短了三个齿。他想：半个月前自己曾经逐队检查，把短齿的耙和犁铧都补上了，为什么老六这个耙上还短耙齿？后来他想到，这个地区是半山地带，地里的小石块很多，因此耙齿很容易折断。应该赶快帮公社解决这个问题。
    营业员的责任感促使小孙没有吃饭就回了分销店，把耙齿和犁铧装了一平车拉到公社。在路上，他又碰到了贺老六。原来老六吃了饭正准备找队长谈耙齿的事。小孙知道他是去要耙齿，就说：“大伯，别着急，耙齿给您送来了。”老六惊奇地说：“你怎么就摸透了我的心？”小孙把刚才看到的、心里想的说了一下，贺老六不禁连连夸奖。
    这天晚上，小孙就把七十个犁铧和二千多个耙齿送到了各个生产队。（世华、经显、墨林）
