Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, October 14th: Teachers and students in schools at all levels in Fujian Province are enthusiastically responding to the call of the entire Party and the entire people to greatly expand agriculture and grain production, actively supporting agricultural production.

After the start of the new semester in September, schools in Fujian have made comprehensive support for agriculture, with agriculture as the foundation, one of the contents of current affairs and political education. They have also organized teachers and students to seriously discuss plans for comprehensive support for agriculture, linking up with nearby communes to make support for agriculture a regular system. Schools provide support in terms of labor, technology, and culture according to their own characteristics and the needs of rural production. Sixteen full-time middle schools, agricultural middle schools, and eighty-three primary schools in Changle County have linked up with local commune production teams and signed support contracts. Since the start of the semester, teachers and students have used labor time and spare time to weed and cultivate more than 5,000 mu of late rice and sweet potatoes for the communes, and have also helped to accumulate and deliver more than 120,000 dan of fertilizer. Since the start of the semester, primary and secondary schools in Jinjiang County have also helped communes accumulate a large amount of fertilizer.

Many schools, especially universities and vocational and technical schools, are helping communes carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements and disseminate scientific and technical knowledge, according to the characteristics of their schools. The Fujian Institute of Electrical Engineering dispatched professional teachers and students to help the nearby Gushan Commune repair and maintain lines, prepared to build a farm tool repair factory for the Beifeng Commune in Minhou County, extracted a 12-horsepower gas engine to support the Yutian Commune in Changle County, and manufactured more than 80,000 washer parts for rapid harvesters to support the autumn harvest. The Fuan Agricultural College helped commune production teams create and promote new-style agricultural tools, and helped set up local fertilizer plants and pesticide plants. Many schools have promptly promoted new experimental achievements to communes and cultivated technical talents for communes. The Fujian Fuel College has trained more than 300 intermediate technicians for rural areas throughout the province.

Schools in various places have also set up their own factories, farms, and livestock farms, establishing teaching and production bases. Changting Normal School has recently opened up many wasteland on nearby mountains and planted vegetables and miscellaneous grains. In addition to expanding the planting area, Zhangzhou No. 1 Middle School has recently strengthened crop experiments, established many nurseries, experimental gardens, and biology corners, conducted scientific research and teaching experiments, so that teaching is better integrated with production.

In carrying out activities to support agriculture, teachers and students in various schools have closely linked teaching, scientific research, and productive labor. Through these activities, they have further cultivated communist morality, learned many knowledge and skills, and strengthened their physical fitness. Due to the connection between teaching and practice, students have acquired more comprehensive and solid knowledge, and the quality of learning has also been greatly improved.

    响应大办粮食号召　充实教学工作内容
    福建各级学校积极支援农业生产
    新华社福州14日电　福建省各地各级学校师生热烈响应全党全民大办农业大办粮食的号召，积极支援农业生产。
    9月新学年开始后，福建各地学校都把以农业为基础全面支援农业作为时事政治教育内容之一，并且组织师生，认真讨论全面支援农业的计划，同附近公社挂钩，使支援农业成为经常的制度。各校根据自己的特点和农村生产上的需要，从劳力、技术和文化等三方面进行支援。长乐县的十六所全日制中学、农业中学和八十三所小学，同当地公社生产队挂钩，订立支援合同，开学以来，各校师生已利用劳动时间和课余时间为公社的晚稻、甘薯中耕除草五千多亩，还帮助积送肥料十二万多担。晋江县中小学开学以来也都帮助公社积了大量肥料。
    许多学校特别是高等学校和专业技术学校，根据自己学校的特点，帮助公社开展技术革新和技术革命运动，传播科学技术知识。福建机电学院派出专业教员和学生到附近鼓山公社帮助检修、维护线路，为闽侯县北峰公社筹建一座农具修械厂，抽出一部十二马力煤气机支援长乐县玉田公社，并制造快速收割器垫圈零件八万多个，支援秋收。福安农业专科学校帮助公社生产队创制和推广新式农具，并帮助举办土化肥厂和农药厂。许多学校都把新的试验成就及时推广给公社，并为公社培养技术人材。福建省燃料专科学校已为全省各地农村培养了三百多名中级技术人员。
    各地学校自己也大办工厂、农场、畜牧场，建立教学和生产基地。长汀师范学校最近在附近山上开了许多荒地，种上蔬菜杂粮。漳州第一中学除了扩大种植面积以外，最近又加强作物试验，建立了许多苗圃、实验园地、生物角，进行科学研究和教学试验，使教学更好地与生产相结合。
    各校师生在开展支援农业的活动中，把教学、科学研究和生产劳动密切联系起来，通过这些活动进一步培养共产主义道德品质，学会了许多知识技能，并且增强了体质。由于教学和实际联系，学生获得的知识更加全面、巩固，学习质量也大大提高。（附图片）
