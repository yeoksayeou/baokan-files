    Accelerating the Development of China's Modern Insect Resource Science
    Bao Jianzhong
    Insects hold an absolute advantage in number within the animal kingdom. Of the approximately 1.25 million known animal species in the world, insects account for nearly one million. This group of astonishingly numerous and widely distributed small animals has close relationships with our socialist construction, people's material lives, and health care. In ancient China, our people had rich experiences in insect ecology observation and research, beneficial insect utilization, and pest control. In pest control, as early as two thousand years ago, China widely used arsenic, mercury, and hellebore and other insecticides; the government had special officials for pest control; seven hundred years ago, the world's first locust control regulations were promulgated; and more than three hundred years ago, there were very good locust control methods. The ancient Chinese working people also made brilliant contributions in the utilization of insect resources, such as research on the life habits and breeding techniques of silkworms.
    Research on the Utilization of Insect Resources
    Research on the utilization of insect resources includes the following aspects:
    Research on the utilization of industrial insect resources. Many insect products have become important industrial raw materials, such as silk, shellac, beeswax, gallnuts, and so on. Insect products such as silk, shellac, and beeswax have been widely used in electrical appliances, plastics, paints, and the manufacture of airplanes, automobiles, and ships. Researching the application of insect products in modern industry is still a young field. Currently, research into developing new insect resources and exploring new uses should be given attention.
    Research on the utilization of agricultural insect resources. The vast majority of fruit trees, vegetables, forage, and field crops are cross-pollinated. A large amount of foreign experimental data proves that using bees for pollination can increase cotton production by 19%; increase buckwheat yields by an average of 41%; sunflowers by an average of 40%; and alfalfa by an average of 75%. In 1959, experiments in various parts of China using bees to pollinate crops such as rapeseed, sunflowers, cotton, buckwheat, and fruit trees also confirmed that yields could be increased by 23%-70%. Pollination experiments with bees on rapeseed at Fujian Agricultural College showed that rapeseed yield increased by 55%-70%, the oil content of rapeseed increased by 4.62%, and the vitality of seed offspring also significantly improved. Experiments at the Xiangkuang Bee Farm in Jiangxi Province showed that citrus production could be more than doubled. Certain plants also exhibit selectivity regarding the types of pollinating insects. For example, female figs must be pollinated by fig wasps to bear fruit. Insect pollination of plants can not only increase the yield of crops but also improve the quality of crops. This effective experiment provides a new way to achieve large-scale agricultural yield increases.
    Another aspect of agricultural insect resource utilization is the utilization of natural enemy insects of pests. Trichogramma wasps to control sugarcane borers, black-green chalcid wasps to control overwintering pink bollworms in warehouses, Australian ladybugs and large red ladybugs to control citrus cottony cushion scale, and Taiwanese bamboo tube ants and Guangdong tropical red ants to control sugarcane and citrus pests have all shown satisfactory results, and some have been very effective. These all provide favorable conditions for better implementing the "protection" aspect of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture."
    Research on the utilization of medical insect resources. There are many examples of using insects and their products as medicinal materials to treat diseases. Insects are indispensable in traditional Chinese medicine. Two thousand years ago, the ancient Chinese medical book "Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica" had already recorded twenty-one kinds of insects as medicinal. The "Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica" provided detailed records of the therapeutic effects of honey. Modern medical clinical experiments have also proven that oral administration of honey can treat peptic ulcers, chronic constipation, hypertension, heart disease, etc.; external use can treat itchy, painful, moist, and ulcerative skin diseases. Royal jelly, bee venom, propolis, etc., all have significant therapeutic effects on certain diseases, such as propolis, which in recent years has been found to inhibit various bacteria. Our ancestors have also long used cicada slough to reduce fever, promote rash eruption, remove eye nebula, treat skin sores, stop infantile night crying, and cure stroke with loss of voice; used white stiff silkworms to treat infantile convulsions, night crying, eliminate wind-phlegm cough, headache, toothache, and trauma; used mantises to treat infantile convulsions and extract arrowheads; used mantis ootheca to treat impotence, seminal emission, and enuresis; used dung beetles to treat bowel disorders; and used rice grasshoppers to treat infantile whooping cough and tetanus, all with good results. Insects like blister beetles, meloids, *Gampsocleis gratiosa*, and ground beetles, contain cantharidin toxins, which can be used to treat venomous substances, induce abortions, promote menstruation, treat rabies, and treat gonorrhea; external application can treat malignant sores, ulcers, carbuncles to draw pus, chronic ringworm sores, warts, moles, and dark spots. In the prescriptions of past dynasties and folk remedies, many other insects and their products each have their corresponding therapeutic effects.
    China has extremely rich insect resources. At present, the number of beneficial insects utilized is still small, waiting for us to continuously discover and research.
    Development Prospects of Modern Insect Resource Science
    In the modern era of rapid scientific and technological development, it is possible to apply new achievements in physics to transform insects to better meet human needs. Soviet scientists have successfully conducted experiments on artificial parthenogenesis and androgenesis of silkworm moths using physical methods. Within a limited range, people can obtain animals of whatever gender they want at will. This is of great significance in the silkworm industry, because raising male silkworms produces 20%-30% more silk than raising female silkworms. The Soviet Union and Japan use X-rays or gamma rays to irradiate silkworm pupae to cultivate new varieties of female silkworm moths, which can lay eggs of two colors, black and white. Black eggs hatch into female silkworms, and white eggs hatch into male silkworms. Or use rays to irradiate silkworm eggs to produce sex-linked markings on the larvae that hatch, that is, eye-shaped, crescent-shaped, star-shaped, and other markings appear on the chest and abdomen of female insects, while male insects have no sex-linked markings, making it easy to distinguish between male and female individuals. The achievements obtained by using physical methods and new technologies to transform insects give people full confidence in extracting more wealth from the vast insect animal kingdom.
    In addition to using new physical technologies, there are other ways to transform insects according to people's needs. The purpose of transforming insects can also be achieved through sexual hybridization, nutritional improvement, and species introduction and domestication. For example, feeding castor silkworms with dandelions, after successive generations of selection and breeding, can gradually improve the cocooning rate, cocoon shell rate, and egg production. Another example is the folk method created by the masses, using "cotton flower fragrance syrup stimulant" can also achieve the purpose of changing the honey source habits of bees, thereby increasing cotton production.
    In carrying out research on the utilization of insect resources, it is necessary to be good at thinking about things from multiple perspectives, dare to break the old concepts that have been formed, and explore new ways. Many types of insects are pests of crops. While controlling pests to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture, whether pests can be turned into useful things under certain conditions is a very important issue. The comprehensive utilization experiment of pine caterpillars, a major forest pest, jointly conducted by Hunan Forestry College and Hunan Provincial Forestry Science Research Institute, proved that the larvae of pine caterpillars can be used as fertilizer for various crops; the cocoons can be spun into cotton-wool fabrics after reeling; the pupae can be pressed for oil, and the pupa residue after oil extraction can also be refined into protein, which has great economic value. This is a good example of turning unfavorable factors into favorable factors and turning pests into beneficial insects.
    Strive to Rapidly Develop China's Modern Insect Resource Science
    Although the utilization of insect resources in China has a long and ancient history, and sericulture and beekeeping have developed into independent disciplines, systematically exploring new insect resources and seeking new uses, especially using modern new technologies to transform insects, is, after all, a new work. Therefore, to push the scientific research cause of insect resource utilization to a new peak, we must establish great ambitions and lofty aspirations, conduct research work creatively, and develop and establish China's own modern insect resource science.
    We must conduct scientific investigations and summaries in an organized and planned manner to understand and grasp the types and utilization value of resource insects currently scattered in various places, and at the same time accumulate scientific data such as the natural conditions and economic conditions of the producing areas of resource insects. In addition, we should also pay attention to excavating and sorting out the scientific heritage of insect resource utilization scattered in various classics to lay the foundation for further large-scale research on insect resource utilization.
    In the process of scientific investigation and summary of insect resources, we must unswervingly implement the policy of following the mass line. The broad masses of working people are producers who directly struggle with nature. They have rich production knowledge, practical experience, and knowledge passed down through generations that is not found in the classics. For example, farmers in Zhangjiapan and Liuguiwan in Jingbian, northern Shaanxi, use the secretions of an insect that lives on willows to make sugar for consumption. The taste and color of this insect sugar are the same as ordinary brown sugar. It is necessary to study and summarize the utilization of this resource insect and develop new uses. It can be expected that investigating and summarizing the scientific heritage of resource insect utilization scattered among the people and in the classics will inevitably advance China's scientific research on insect resource utilization.
    Combining Professional Research of Scientific Institutions with Mass Scientific Research Activities
    To utilize a new resource insect, it is necessary to first study the biological characteristics of the resource insect, the special requirements of the natural environment, and the way and characteristics of adapting to the surrounding biological community, in order to achieve the purpose of transformation, reproduction, and utilization. In terms of transformation, it is mainly through sexual hybridization, nutritional improvement, and physical methods. Species introduction and domestication are also part of this work. Reproduction mainly includes three aspects: breeding technology, pest and disease prevention and control, and host (plant or insect) cultivation. In terms of utilization of insect products, there are chemical analysis, processing and trial manufacturing, developing new uses, and improving old uses. In terms of pollination, medical treatment, and natural enemies, it includes pollination ability, the mode of action and principle of medical treatment, the release of natural enemies, and the measurement of the efficiency of these aspects of utilization. While scientific institutions are conducting professional research, mass scientific research activities on insect resources must not be ignored. The "cotton flower fragrance syrup stimulant" that changed the habit of bees not collecting cotton nectar, thereby increasing cotton production by 14%, was researched and created by farmers in Zhangxindian, Macheng County, Hubei Province. Resolutely implementing the "walking on two legs" policy of combining professional institutions and mass scientific research activities is of great significance for accelerating the development and improvement of China's insect resource utilization.

    加速发展我国的现代昆虫资源学
    包建中
    昆虫数量在动物界中占居绝对优势。世界上已经知道的动物约有一百二十五万余种，其中昆虫就占了约近一百万种左右。这一群为数惊人分布广泛的小动物，同我们的社会主义建设事业、人民物质生活及卫生保健的关系都很密切。我国古代人民无论在昆虫生态的观察研究、益虫利用与害虫防除各方面，都有过丰富的经验。在害虫防除方面，我国二千年前就多用砷剂、汞剂和藜芦等杀虫药剂；政府已设有专门治虫的官吏；七百年前颁布了全世界第一道的治蝗法规；三百多年前就有了很好的治蝗办法。我国古代劳动人民在利用昆虫资源方面也有过光辉的贡献，如对家蚕的生活习性及饲养技术的研究等。
    昆虫资源的利用研究
    昆虫资源的利用研究工作有这样几个方面：
    工业昆虫资源的利用研究。昆虫产品成为重要工业原料的很多，如蚕丝、紫胶、蜂蜡、五倍子等等。蚕丝、紫胶、蜂蜡等昆虫产品已在电器、塑料、油漆和飞机、汽车、轮船制造业中广泛应用。研究昆虫产品在近代工业中的应用还是一门年轻的事业。目前，开拓新的昆虫资源和探求新用途的研究，应该引起重视。
    农业昆虫资源的利用研究。极大多数的果树、蔬菜、牧草以及大田作物都是异花授粉的。据国外的大量实验资料证明：利用蜜蜂来授粉，能使棉花产量提高19％；使荞麦的收获量平均提高41％；向日葵平均提高40％；紫苜蓿平均提高75％。1959年我国各地用蜜蜂对油菜、向日葵、棉花、荞麦、果树等作物授粉增产的试验也证实可增产23％—70％。福建农学院的蜜蜂对油菜授粉试验证明：菜籽增产55％—70％，菜籽的含油率提高4.62％，种子后代的生活力也有显著的提高。江西省向圹种蜂场的试验，柑桔可增产两倍多。某些植物对授粉昆虫的种类还具有选择性，例如雌无花果，必须有无花果小蜂授粉始能结实。昆虫对植物进行授粉，不仅能提高农作物的产量，而且能提高农作物的质量。这种有成效的试验为农业大面积增产提供了一条新途径。
    农业昆虫资源利用的另一方面是害虫的天敌昆虫的利用。赤眼蜂防治甘蔗螟，黑青小蜂防治仓库内越冬红铃虫，澳洲瓢虫、大红瓢虫防治柑桔吹绵介壳虫，台湾竹筒蚁和广东热带红蚂蚁防治甘蔗和柑桔害虫，效果均较满意，有的收效很显著。这些都为更好地贯彻农业“八字宪法”中的“保”字，提供了有利条件。
    医学昆虫资源的利用研究。利用昆虫体躯和它的生产品作为药材，以治疗疾病的事例很多。中药里昆虫是不可缺少的。两千年前，我国古医书《神农本草经》上即已记载有二十一种昆虫被列为药用。在《神农本草经》上对蜂蜜治病的疗效就有过详尽的记载。近代医学上的临床实验也已证明，蜂蜜内服能治疗消化性溃疡、慢性便秘及高血压、心脏病等；外用能治痒痛湿烂性皮肤病。王浆、蜂毒、蜂胶等，对治疗某些疾病都具有显著的疗效，其中如蜂胶，近年来并发现对多种细菌有抑制作用。我们的祖辈还一直应用蝉蜕来退热、发痘、退目翳、治皮肤疮疡、止小儿夜啼及中风失音等病；用白僵蚕治小儿惊癎、夜啼、去风痰喘嗽、头痛、牙痛和金疮；用螳螂治小儿惊风及出箭镞；用螳螂的卵块治阳痿、遗精和遗尿；用蜣螂治大小便症；稻蝗治小儿百日咳及破伤风，都有良好的效果。斑蝥、芫菁、葛上亭长、地胆一类昆虫，含有斑蝥素的毒素，能用来治蠱毒，堕死胎、通经血、治疯狗咬、治淋疾；外用敷恶疮溃烂及痈疽拔脓、积年癣疮、疣痣黑子等。在历代的方书和民间的偏方中，涉及的其他许多昆虫及其产品，都各有其相应的疗效。
    我国拥有极为丰富的昆虫资源。目前，益虫利用的数量还不多，有待于我们不断发掘和研究。
    现代昆虫资源学的发展远景
    在科学技术迅速发展的现代，应用物理学的新成就来改造昆虫以便更符合人类需求，是可能的。苏联科学家用物理学的方法已成功地进行了蚕蛾的人工孤雌生殖和孤雄生殖的试验。人们在有限的范围内，可以随心所欲地要什么性别的动物就得到什么性别的动物。这在养蚕业中有着很大意义，因为养雄蚕要比养雌蚕多产丝20％—30％。苏联和日本利用X射线或Γ射线照射蚕蛹，能培育出新品种的雌蚕蛾，这种蛾能产黑白二种色的卵，黑色卵孵化出雌蚕，白色卵孵化出雄蚕。或用射线照射蚕卵，使孵化出来的幼虫体产生伴性纹，即在雌虫胸部和腹部产生眼状、半月状、星状等斑纹，而雄虫无伴性纹，则易于使雌雄个体加以区别。应用物理学的方法和新技术改造昆虫所获得的成果，使人们满怀信心向浩瀚的昆虫动物界索取更多的财富。
    根据人们的需要目的来改造昆虫，除了采用物理学新技术以外，还有其他办法。通过有性杂交、营养改良、引种驯化等途径也可以达到改造昆虫的目的。如用蒲公英饲养蓖麻蚕，经过逐代选育和繁殖以后，对于结茧率、茧层率和产卵量都能逐步提高。又如群众创造的土办法，用“棉花花香糖浆兴奋剂”也能达到使蜜蜂改变趋蜜源的习性的目的，而使棉花增产。
    在开展昆虫资源利用研究工作中要善于从事物的多方面思考，敢于打破已形成的旧概念，探索新途径。昆虫中很多种类是农作物的害虫。在防治害虫夺取农业大丰收的同时，在一定条件下能否使害虫变为有用之物是很重要的问题。湖南林学院和湖南省林业科学研究所合作做的林木大害虫——松毛虫的综合利用试验，证明松毛虫的幼虫可以做各种作物的肥料；茧抽丝后可纺棉毛织品；蛹可榨油，榨油后的蛹渣还可以提炼出蛋白质，经济价值很大。这是变不利因素为有利因素，变害虫为益虫的一个很好的例子。
    为迅速发展我国的现代昆虫资源学而奋斗
    昆虫资源的利用在我国虽有悠久而古老的历史，养蚕、养蜂已发展成为独立的学科，但是系统地探索新的昆虫资源和探求新的用途，尤其是利用现代新技术改造昆虫，毕竟还是新生的工作。因此，要把昆虫资源利用的科学研究事业推向新的高峰，就一定要树雄心立大志，创造性地进行研究工作，开拓和建立我国自己的现代昆虫资源学。
    我们要有组织、有计划地进行科学调查总结，以便了解掌握目前尚散处各地的资源昆虫的种类和利用价值，同时积累资源昆虫的产区的自然条件和经济条件等科学资料。此外，还应该注意发掘整理散处在各种典籍中的昆虫资源利用的科学遗产，为进一步大规模开展昆虫资源利用的研究工作，奠定基础。
    在昆虫资源的科学调查总结的过程中，必须坚定不移地贯彻执行走群众路线的方针。广大劳动人民是直接向自然斗争的生产者，他们有丰富的生产知识、实践经验和世辈相传的不见于典籍的知识。如陕北靖边张家畔、柳桂湾一带农民利用寄居在柳树上的一种昆虫的分泌物来熬糖供食用。此种虫糖的滋味和色泽与普通红糖一样。对这种资源昆虫的利用，就有必要加以研究和总结，并开辟新用途。可以预期，调查总结散处在民间及典籍中的资源昆虫利用的科学遗产，必然会使我国昆虫资源利用的科学研究工作前进一步。
    科学机构的专业研究与群众性科学研究活动相结合
    要利用一种新的资源昆虫，必须首先对该种资源昆虫的生物学特性，对自然环境的特殊要求，以及与周围生物群适应的方式和特点等加以研究，才能达到改造、繁殖、利用的目的。在改造方面，主要是通过有性杂交、营养改良和物理学方法等途径。引种驯化也是这方面的工作内容之一。繁殖主要为饲养技术、病虫防除、寄主（植物或昆虫）培育等三个方面。利用在虫产方面则有化学分析、加工试制、开辟新用途改进旧用法等。在授粉、医疗、天敌方面，则包括授粉能力，医疗的作用方式及原理，天敌的散放以及这些方面利用的效率的测定。在科学机构专业研究的同时，绝不能忽视群众对昆虫资源的科学研究活动。改变蜜蜂不采棉花蜜的习性，从而使棉花增产14％的“棉花花香糖浆兴奋剂”，就是湖北省麻城县张新店农民自己研究创造出来的。坚决贯彻专业机关和群众性的科学研究活动相结合的“两条腿走路”的方针，对加速发展和提高我国昆虫资源的利用事业有着十分重大的意义。
