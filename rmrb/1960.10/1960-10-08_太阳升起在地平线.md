The Sun Rises on the Horizon

朝鲜　　尚民
朝鲜尚民

At night, the cooperative rings its bell, and people gather in groups of twos and threes towards the meeting room; the smoke-filled room suddenly quiets down, listening to the Party Secretary's speech. Everyone is excited, unable to calm down, he seems to be narrating a dream… making people feel dazed and excited, a new world appears before their eyes. One hundred bags of rice per *machi-bo*! (Note) Yesterday, this was something they wouldn’t even dare to imagine, a primordial legend; now, the ridges are straight and stretch as far as the eye can see, and mountains of golden grain rise one after another.

This is the Three Mountains Agricultural Production Cooperative, where every valley ripples with green waves, and the sounds of tractors, trucks, and harvesters in the production team soar straight into the clouds. The thatched huts where generations have lived have been torn down, and palace-like buildings have been erected, with clubs, bathhouses, and libraries standing side by side in rows. We live in an earthly paradise; how can the Peach Blossom Spring or the Pure Land of Bliss compare?

On the grassland, full of colorful flowers and plants, livestock are like clouds, flowing in all directions. This is not a dream, not a myth, this is the magnificent construction plan proposed by our leader; this is a great battle order, the undertaking of a century must be realized today!

The sun rises on the horizon, illuminating everyone's heart, people walk out of the meeting place with greater determination, and the communist banner flutters in the front.

Note: One *machi-bo* is approximately equal to fifteen *shi mu* (about 1 hectare)

    太阳升起在地平线
    朝鲜　　尚民夜晚，合作社响起钟声，人们三五成群走向会议室；满是烟雾的屋里突然安静
  下来，倾听党委书记讲话。个个激动，无法平静，他仿佛在叙说梦境……令人恍惚，令人振奋，眼前出现了一个新天地。每町步出大米一百袋（注）！昨天，这还是想都不敢想的
  太古传说，如今，田垅笔直望不到头，粮食的金山一座又一座。这儿是三山农业生产合作社，条条山谷碧波荡漾，拖拉机，卡车，收割机，生产队机器的声响直冲云
  霄。祖祖辈辈居住的茅屋推倒了，矗立起宫殿一般的楼房，俱乐部，浴室，图书馆，栉比鳞次，并排而立。我们生活在地上的乐园，那桃花源、极乐世界怎能相
  比？花草缤纷的草原上，牲畜如云，流向四方。这不是梦，不是神话，这是我们领袖提出的宏伟建
  设图；这是伟大的战斗命令，百年后的事业要在今天实
  现！太阳升起在地平线，照亮了每个人的心，人们怀着更大的决心走出
  会场，共产主义旗帜飘扬在前方。
    注：一町步约合十五市亩
