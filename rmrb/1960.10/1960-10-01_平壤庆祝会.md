Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 30th. The Korea-China Friendship Association held a Korea-China Friendship Evening in Pyongyang tonight to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Among those who attended the evening were Kim Chong-hyon, Vice Chairman of the Korea-China Friendship Association and Minister of Higher Education of Korea; Kim Tae-hui, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Choi Sung-sook, Vice Chairman of the Korean Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries; Park Pal-yang, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Writers' Union; and people from all walks of life in Pyongyang. Qiao Xiaoguang, Chinese Ambassador to North Korea, and embassy staff were invited to attend the evening.

Vice Chairman Kim Chong-hyon and Ambassador Qiao Xiaoguang spoke at the meeting successively.

In his speech, Kim Chong-hyon first extended warm congratulations to the Chinese people. He said: Under the wise leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are marching forward by leaps and bounds, holding high the three red banners of the general line for socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune. The achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction have proved the correctness of the general line put forward by the Communist Party of China. He said that the achievements made by the Chinese people have inspired the Korean people.

He pointed out that the People's Republic of China has grown into a strong socialist country and plays a huge role in the struggle for world peace and socialist construction.

Kim Chong-hyon emphasized that the great friendship and solidarity between the people of Korea and China cannot be undermined by any desperate struggle of the enemy, and that the strength of this friendship is being strengthened and developed day by day.

Ambassador Qiao Xiaoguang then spoke, describing the great achievements made by the Chinese people in construction and praising the great achievements made by North Korea in the Chollima Movement. He said: The friendship between the people of China and North Korea has been established in the long-term common struggle after severe tests of sharing life and death and weal and woe, and is based on the ideological foundation of Marxism-Leninism. Especially in the common struggle against the aggression of US imperialism, the outstanding sons and daughters of our two countries fought side by side, which greatly promoted the all-round development of our friendly and cooperative relations. He finally expressed the hope that the people of China and North Korea will join hands more closely and strive to strengthen the unity and strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

After the meeting, the Chinese art film "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains" was shown.
