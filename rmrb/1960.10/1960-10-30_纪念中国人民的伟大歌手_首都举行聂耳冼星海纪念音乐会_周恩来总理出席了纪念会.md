Xinhua News Agency, 29th. The literary and art circles of the capital solemnly held a commemorative concert at the Capital Theater tonight to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the death of Nie Er, the great singer of the Chinese people, the pioneer and founder of Chinese proletarian musical art, and the 15th anniversary of the death of his comrade-in-arms, Xian Xinghai.

Premier Zhou Enlai attended the commemorative concert.

Also attending the commemoration were Guo Moruo, Xia Yan, Yang Hansheng, Tian Han, Chu Tunan, Ouyang Yuqian, Lü Ji, Zhang Guangnian, Zhou Weizhi, Li Wei, Zhao Feng and other famous figures in literary and art circles, many of whom were comrades-in-arms of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai during their lifetimes.

Foreign friends from the Cuban Cultural Delegation, the Brazilian "Samba" Orchestra, and the Venezuelan Cultural Delegation who were invited to visit our country also attended the commemoration.

The commemoration was presided over by Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture. In his speech, he pointed out that under the leadership of the Party, Nie Er and Xian Xinghai used musical art as a weapon to wage a tenacious struggle against enemies at home and abroad, and drew nourishment from the revolutionary struggles of the masses, creating a large number of excellent works that educate the people, unite the people, and are forever inspiring. Xia Yan said that the path taken by Nie Er and Xian Xinghai is the path of Chinese intellectuals who, under the leadership of the Party and in the revolutionary struggles of the masses, constantly transform themselves and become proletarian fighters. The revolutionary fighting spirit reflected in the works of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, and the direction of massification and nationalization, are the most valuable traditions of our revolutionary music. Xia Yan concluded by saying that today, when we commemorate Nie Er, Xian Xinghai, and the revolutionary fighters who have fallen on the musical front, the most important thing is to learn their revolutionary spirit, take them as examples, stand forever at the forefront of socialist revolution and construction, continue to wage unremitting and resolute struggles against all anti-socialist thoughts, especially modern revisionist thoughts, and hold high the three red flags, launching a magnificent singing movement for socialist construction, creating works worthy of this great era in the great leap forward of socialist construction, and giving full play to the due role of revolutionary music.

Lü Ji, Chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association, gave a report at the commemoration entitled "Great Revolutionary Fighters, Pioneers of Proletarian Revolutionary Music." In his report, Lü Ji outlined the historical background of the creative activities of the two people's musicians, Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, introduced their creative paths, analyzed the characteristics of their works, and pointed out that Nie Er and Xian Xinghai made great contributions to the revolutionary cause of our people and the cause of national liberation with their revolutionary music and revolutionary musical activities. Lü Ji said: Nie Er and Xian Xinghai did not participate in the revolutionary musical activities led by the Chinese Communist Party for a very long time, but because they unconditionally contributed everything to the revolutionary cause, followed the teachings of the Party, strived to transform their world outlook, strived to approach the workers and peasants, and under the white terror of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, unyieldingly waged a resolute struggle against the reactionaries, striving to make their musical activities, especially musical creation activities, subject to the needs of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle of the masses of the people under the leadership of the proletariat, and correctly implemented the Party's literary and artistic policies, they were able to create many immortal musical works in a short period of time, opening up a broad road for our country's proletarian revolutionary music and laying a solid foundation. Lü Ji pointed out that today, when music workers commemorate these two great people's musicians, pioneers of proletarian revolutionary music, they must first learn their revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, diligent learning, hard work, and dedication of everything to the revolutionary cause, inherit their revolutionary tradition of music serving proletarian politics, give play to the positive role of music, serve agricultural production, socialist revolution, and socialist construction, and strive to create new socialist national music of a higher level.

After Lü Ji's report, the Central Experimental Opera House, the Central National Orchestra, the Central Song and Dance Troupe, the China Children's Art Theater, the Central Philharmonic Orchestra, the Central Broadcasting Orchestra Chorus, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe Chorus and other units performed the opera "Storm on the Yangtze River" composed by Nie Er, and the song and dance "Production Chorus" composed by Xian Xinghai, as well as mass songs such as "Pioneers," "National Salvation Army Song," "On the Taihang Mountains," "Roar, Yellow River," and "March of the Volunteers." When the concert proceeded to the last program, "March of the Volunteers," Premier Zhou Enlai and all the participants of the commemoration stood up and sang in unison with the actors on the stage. At this time, the audience was filled with the sound of this magnificent revolutionary song, and people's excitement reached a climax.

After the performance, Premier Zhou Enlai went on stage and warmly shook hands with the actors and took pictures with them.

    新华社29日讯　首都文艺界为纪念中国人民的伟大歌手、中国无产阶级音乐艺术先驱者、奠基人聂耳逝世二十五周年，和他的战友冼星海逝世十五周年，今晚在首都剧场隆重举行纪念音乐会。
    周恩来总理出席了纪念音乐会。
    出席纪念会的还有郭沫若、夏衍、阳翰笙、田汉、楚图南、欧阳予倩、吕骥、张光年、周巍峙、李伟、赵沨等文艺界著名人士，他们之中，许多是聂耳、冼星海生前的战友。
    应邀来我国访问的古巴文化代表团、巴西“桑巴”乐团、委内瑞拉文化代表团的外国朋友们也出席了纪念会。
    纪念会由文化部副部长夏衍主持。他在致词中指出：聂耳和冼星海在党的领导下，以音乐艺术作为武器，和国内外敌人进行了坚韧不屈的斗争，并在群众的革命斗争中吸取营养，创造了大量的教育人民、团结人民、永远激动人心的优秀作品。夏衍说：聂耳、冼星海所走的道路，是中国知识分子在党的领导下，在群众的革命斗争中不断改造自己而成为一个无产阶级战士的道路。聂耳和冼星海的作品中所反映出来的革命的战斗的精神，和群众化、民族化的方向，正是我国革命音乐的最可贵的传统。夏衍最后说：今天我们纪念聂耳、冼星海以及音乐战线上倒下去了的革命战士，最重要的是学习他们的革命精神，以他们作为榜样，永远站在社会主义革命和建设的前线阵地，继续不懈地和一切反社会主义的思想、特别是现代修正主义思想作坚决的斗争，并应高举三面红旗，掀起一个波澜壮阔的社会主义建设的歌咏运动，在社会主义建设大跃进中，创作出无愧于今天这个伟大时代的作品，发挥革命音乐应有的作用。
    中国音乐家协会主席吕骥在纪念会上，以“伟大的革命战士、无产阶级革命音乐的先锋”为题作了报告。吕骥在报告中概述了聂耳、冼星海两位人民音乐家生前创作活动的时代背景，介绍了他们的创作道路，分析了他们的作品的特色，指出聂耳、冼星海以自己的革命音乐和革命音乐活动，对我国人民革命事业和民族解放事业作出了巨大的贡献。吕骥说：聂耳、冼星海参加中国共产党领导的革命音乐活动都不很长，可是由于他们无条件地把自己的一切贡献给革命事业，遵循着党的教导，努力改造自己的世界观，努力接近工农群众，在国民党反动统治的白色恐怖下，不屈不挠地和反动派进行坚决的斗争，努力使自己的音乐活动，特别是音乐创作活动服从于无产阶级领导的人民大众反帝、反封建的革命斗争的需要，并且正确地贯彻了党的文艺方针，因而能够在不长的时期中，创造了许多不朽的音乐作品，为我国无产阶级革命音乐开辟了广阔的道路，并打下了巩固的基础。吕骥指出，今天音乐工作者纪念聂耳、冼星海这两位伟大的人民音乐家、无产阶级革命音乐的先锋，首先要学习他们艰苦奋斗、虚心学习、刻苦工作、为革命事业贡献自己的一切的革命精神，继承他们音乐为无产阶级政治服务的革命传统，发挥音乐的积极作用，为农业生产、为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，为创造水平更高的社会主义的民族的新音乐而努力。
    吕骥报告结束后，接着由中央实验歌剧院、中央民族乐团、中央歌舞团、中国儿童剧院、中央乐团、中央广播乐团合唱队、中国人民解放军总政歌舞团合唱队等单位演出了聂耳作曲的歌剧“扬子江暴风雨”，和冼星海作曲的歌舞“生产大合唱”，以及“开路先锋”、“救国军歌”、“在太行山上”、“怒吼吧，黄河”、“义勇军进行曲”等群众歌曲。当音乐会进行到最后一个节目“义勇军进行曲”时，周恩来总理和纪念会参加者全体起立，同台上的演员齐声歌唱。这时，全场激荡着这支雄伟的革命歌曲的声浪，人们的兴奋情绪达到了高潮。
    演出结束后，周恩来总理上台和演员们热烈握手，并在一起照了像。
