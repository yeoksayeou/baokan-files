Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 21st – Cuban National Bank President Guevara, in a television program that ended early this morning, condemned the United States for its economic blockade of Cuba.

Guevara said that the United States has announced a boycott and embargo against Cuba. It is also attempting to resolutely obstruct the revolution by completely canceling purchases of sugar from the next sugar harvest season. He said that this may put Cuba in a difficult situation in some respects. However, the United States will also suffer losses from the consequences of this economic offensive against Cuba. He emphasized that the U.S. attack will be met with many Cuban counterattacks, and this attack is bound to fail. The people of all countries are achieving their own liberation, and they will no longer accept the absurd conditions imposed by the Americans.

Guevara also pointed out that economic aggression against Cuba could turn into military aggression. He said that this aggression is entirely planned and financially supported by the United States. Aircraft, warships, weapons, bombs, etc., will all be American. They can come, but they shouldn't dream of escaping from Cuba again. The result of this aggression will only further consolidate the revolution and make the Cuban people more determined to fight, because, in order to ensure the future happiness of the Cuban people, there is no other choice but to struggle tirelessly.

Guevara called on the Cuban people to be vigilant, saying, "If the Americans want to realize this threat to our economy, then everyone should only consider this: his task is to prepare for the struggle in the coming months." He called on the people to believe in their own strength and international support. Guevara said that the National Bank has already conducted the necessary research to ensure the import of temporary consumer goods. Cuba should fight to achieve the following two major tasks: developing agriculture and industrialization. He announced that a series of factories worth 150 million US dollars will be established in the next two years, and the government is considering formulating a five-year industrialization plan worth 350 million to 400 million pesos.

Speaking of his upcoming visit to socialist countries on the 21st, Guevara said that Cuba will establish trade with socialist countries, with a trade volume of 300 million to 400 million pesos.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 21st – Cuban Minister of Trade Cepero Bonilla gave a speech yesterday evening, condemning the U.S. announcement of an economic blockade against Cuba as interference in Cuba's internal affairs.

He pointed out that the purpose of the U.S. economic blockade against Cuba is to obstruct Cuba's national production, disrupt supplies to Cuba, and create objective conditions favorable to counter-revolutionaries.

Cepero Bonilla said: While engaging in economic aggression, the U.S. government is stepping up preparations for armed aggression against Cuba. He emphasized: "The United States prohibits the export of products for peaceful purposes to Cuba, but provides war equipment and materials to those who attempt to shed Cuban blood." He added: "Nevertheless, no economic or military aggression can stop the development of the Cuban revolution. "Imperialism is bound to perish because it violates the development of history."

When talking about the effects of the economic blockade, Cepero Bonilla said: "U.S. imperialism can never isolate Cuba in trade." "Cuba is no longer the only market for U.S. monopoly groups. Now, Cuba trades with all countries in the world." He said: Measures to invade Cuba will only promote the patriotism of the Cuban people. The Cuban revolution is invincible.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 21st – Production has already increased in many large enterprises that have been nationalized by the Cuban government.

According to an announcement by Cuban National Bank President Major Guevara last night, the Cuban Owens-Illinois Glass Factory increased production by 6.5% in the first month of becoming a state enterprise; the Reynaldo Marquez Specialty Pharmaceutical Factory increased production by 19.6%; and the Gravi factory, which produces toothpaste and soap, increased production by 38.58% in the first three months under state management compared to the last three months under private management. Guevara pointed out that these materials "reflect the fundamental changes that are really taking place in state-managed industries."

At the same time, newspaper editorial departments continue to receive a constant stream of letters from factories and trade unions congratulating the nationalization of large enterprises.

In cities and villages, in factories and cooperatives, countless mass activities are being held to support the nationalization of large enterprises. When people heard the exciting news, they held celebratory parades. The marchers cheered "Long live the revolution and long live free Cuba" to the sound of music. Cuban militiamen guard the nationalized large enterprises, and banners with the slogan "We support nationalization" are hung at the entrances of the enterprises.

    格瓦拉说，美国已经宣布对古巴展开抵制和禁运。它还企图坚决阻挠革命，全部取消购买下个榨糖季节的食糖。他说，这使得古巴的处境在某些方面可能遭到困难。但是，美国也将从这种对古巴经济进攻的后果中蒙受损失。他强调指出，美国的攻击将会遭到古巴的许多反击，这种攻击必将失败。各国人民正在取得自己的解放，他们再也不会接受美国人的荒唐地强加的条件。
    格瓦拉还指出，对古巴的经济侵略可能变成军事侵略。他说，这种侵略完全是由美国策划的和给予经济资助的。飞机、兵舰、武器、炸弹等都将是美国的。他们能够来，但是他们休想再逃出古巴。这种侵略的结果只会促使革命更加巩固，只会使古巴人民更坚定不移地进行斗争，因为，为了保证古巴人的未来幸福，除了不倦地进行斗争以外，别无其它选择。
    格瓦拉号召古巴人民提高警惕时说，“假如美国人要对我国的经济实现这种威胁的话，那末每一个人只应该考虑这件事：他的任务是准备在今后几个月进行斗争。”他号召人民相信自己的力量和国际的支援。格瓦拉说，国家银行对保证临时消费品的进口已经作了必要的研究。古巴应该为实现下列二大任务而斗争：发展农业和工业化。他宣布，在以后的两年内将建立价值达一亿五千万美元的一系列的工厂，政府在考虑制订一个价值为三亿五千万比索到四亿比索的五年工业化计划。

    新华社哈瓦那21日电　古巴贸易部长塞佩罗·博尼利亚昨天晚上发表谈话，谴责美国宣布对古巴进行经济封锁是干涉古巴的内政。
    他指出，美国对古巴实行经济封锁的目的是阻挠古巴国家的生产，扰乱对古巴的供应和制造有利于反革命分子的客观条件。
    塞佩罗·博尼利亚说：在经济侵略的同时，美国政府正在加紧准备对古巴的武装侵略，他强调指出：“美国禁止向古巴出口用于和平的产品，但是却向那些企图血洗古巴的人提供战争设备和物资”。他又说：尽管如此，任何经济和军事侵略都决不能阻止古巴革命的发展，“帝国主义肯定要灭亡，因为它违反历史的发展”。
    塞佩罗·博尼利亚在谈到经济封锁的效果时说：“美帝国主义绝不能在贸易上使古巴陷于孤立”，“古巴已经不是美国垄断集团的唯一市场。现在，古巴和全世界各国进行贸易”。他说：侵略古巴的措施只会促进古巴人民的爱国主义。古巴革命是不可战胜的。
    新华社哈瓦那21日电　被古巴政府收归国有的许多大企业的生产都已经有了增长。
    据古巴国家银行行长格瓦拉少校昨天晚上宣布，古巴欧文·伊利诺斯玻璃厂在成为国家企业的第一个月里生产提高了6.5％；雷纳耳多·马克斯特种药品制造厂生产提高了19.6％；生产牙膏和肥皂的格拉维制造厂在国家管理的头三个月比私人经管的最后三个月的生产提高了38.58％。格瓦拉指出，这些材料“反映了在国家管理的工业中真正发生的根本变化”。
    与此同时，各报纸的编辑部继续不断地收到来自各工厂和工会祝贺把大企业收归国有的信件。
    在城市和乡村、在工厂和合作社里，正在举行支持大企业国有化的无数的群众活动。当人们听到这个令人兴奋的消息后，纷纷举行了庆祝游行。游行者在音乐声中欢呼革命和自由古巴万岁。古巴民兵守卫着被收归国有的大企业，在各企业入口处挂着“我们支持收归国有”的标语。
