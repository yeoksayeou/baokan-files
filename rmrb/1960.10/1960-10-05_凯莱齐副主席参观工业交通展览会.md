Xinhua News Agency, October 4th – Abdyl Këllezi, Member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and President of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association, along with all members of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation he led, accompanied by Liu Mingfu, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission, visited the Industrial and Transportation Exhibition this morning. Wang Jiabao, the person in charge of the exhibition, warmly welcomed the distinguished guests on behalf of all the staff.

After introducing the content and arrangement of the exhibition, Wang Jiabao guided the distinguished guests to visit more than a dozen pavilions, including machinery, electric power, coal industry, petroleum industry, chemical industry, agricultural machinery, and construction industry.

As soon as Vice Chairman Kellezi entered the door of the Machinery Pavilion, he was immediately attracted by a huge milling machine. When he learned that this was an automatic milling machine with photoelectric program control, transformed from an old milling machine by Su Guangming, a national model worker and representative of the People's Congress, after a hundred innovations, he repeatedly praised the Chinese workers' soaring revolutionary spirit and the courage to create.

Vice Chairman Kellezi was particularly interested in the light and improved agricultural tools manufactured and matched by farmers in various places during the Great Leap Forward. He ran to the rice transplanter and looked at it again and again. He asked, "How much horsepower is needed to pull it in front?" Wang Jiabao said, "One horsepower is enough." The four-four bricklaying tool created by Liu Haijiang, a construction worker from Baoding City Construction Company, and the mobile lifter that replaced scaffolding, attracted the attention of the distinguished guests. Liu Haijiang gave a demonstration on the spot and told the distinguished guests that using this tool, 28,000 bricks can be laid every day, increasing work efficiency by twenty times and solving the problem of hand abrasion. Vice Chairman Kellezi said that this creation was great. He asked Wang Jiabao for a bricklaying tool and also hoped to get some drawings of the mobile lifter.

Vice Chairman Kellezi visited very carefully today, constantly asking about the functions and creation process of various new machines.

Chen Boqing, Deputy Director of the Soviet and European Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others also accompanied the distinguished guests today.

    凯莱齐副主席参观工业交通展览会
    新华社4日讯　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、部长会议副主席、阿中友好协会主席阿卜杜勒·凯莱齐和他率领的阿中友协代表团全体团员，由国家计划委员会副主任刘明夫陪同，今天上午参观了工业交通展览会。展览会负责人汪家宝代表全体工作人员热烈欢迎贵宾们的光临。
    汪家宝在介绍了展览会的内容和陈设情况以后，引导贵宾们参观了机械、电力、煤炭工业、石油工业、化学工业、农业机械和建筑工业等十几个馆。
    凯莱齐副主席一走进机械馆的门口，立刻就被一台巨大的铣床吸引住了，当他知道了这是全国劳动模范、人民代表大会代表苏广铭经过了一百次的革新，把他的旧铣床改造成光电程序控制的自动铣床的时候，他连连称赞中国工人冲天的革命干劲和勇于创造的精神。
    凯莱齐副主席，对各地农民在大跃进中自己制造的和配套成龙的轻便改良农具，特别感兴趣。他跑到水稻插秧机跟前看了又看，他问：“前面用多少马力的机器牵引？”汪家宝说：“只用一匹马拉就够了。”保定市建筑公司建筑工人刘海江创造的四四砌砖器和代替脚手架的活动升降器，引起了贵宾们的注意，刘海江当场作了表演，并告诉贵宾们说，利用这个工具每天可砌二万八千块砖，提高工效二十倍，还解决了磨手的问题。凯莱齐副主席说，这个创造很伟大。并向汪家宝要了一个砌砖器，还希望给他一部分活动升降器的图样。
    凯莱齐副主席今天参观的很细致，不断询问各种新式机器的功能和创造过程。
    今天陪同贵宾参观的，还有外交部苏欧司副司长陈伯清等。
