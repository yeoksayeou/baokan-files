    New Warriors of Education
    With the rapid development of national construction, the proportion of new workers in factories and mines is increasing. Taking Yingcheng Coal Mine as an example, the number of new workers added in the past two years accounts for 70% of the total number of workers in the mine. 70%, this is the majority in production. Whether the 70% can fully play their role has a decisive impact on whether the production tasks of factories and mines can be successfully completed. Therefore, doing a good job with these 70% of new workers and rapidly improving their political consciousness and technical level is a problem that the leadership of factories and mines needs to pay great attention to in the increasing production and practicing economy campaign.
    The vast majority of new workers come from rural areas, schools, and other fronts, and they have grown up under the education of the Party. They also make rapid progress after arriving at factories and mines, which is very valuable. But at the same time, it should also be seen that these new workers have not received modern enterprise production technology training, and their organizational discipline and collectivist ideological habits are not as good as those of the old workers. Their technical level is also relatively low, and they often cannot cope with changes in work types or technical obstacles. Therefore, to enable them to play a greater role in production, special attention should be paid to strengthening their training and education. The leadership of Yingcheng Coal Mine has grasped this work tightly, which has continuously improved the awareness of new workers, made them more motivated, and greatly increased their enthusiasm and initiative in learning technology. As a result, it has powerfully promoted the increase in coal production. The experience of Yingcheng Coal Mine is meaningful to most enterprises today.
    Old workers are the backbone of production. Outstanding old workers are living examples worthy of learning for new workers in terms of ideological awareness, technical level, and production experience. Therefore, when strengthening the education of new workers, the role of old workers should be fully utilized. Old workers should be mobilized to actively help new workers, and to regard the training and education of a new generation who are both red and expert, to strengthen the ranks of the working class, as their glorious responsibility. This is the most important step in doing a good job with new workers.

    教育新战士
    随着国家建设事业的飞跃发展，新工人的成分在厂矿企业里所占的比重越来越大。以营城煤矿为例，两年来增加的新工人已经占到全矿工人总数的70％。70％，这是生产中的大多数。70％的人是否充分发挥作用，可以说，对能否胜利地完成厂矿企业的生产任务，有着决定性的影响。因此，做好70％的新工人的工作，迅速提高他们的政治觉悟和技术水平，是厂矿领导部门在增产节约运动中需要十分重视的问题。
    新工人绝大部分来自农村、学校以及其他战线，他们是在党的教育下成长起来的。到厂矿以后进步也很快，这些都是十分可贵的。但同时也应该看到，这些新工人毕竟没有受过现代企业的生产技术训练，组织性、纪律性、集体主义的思想习惯，还赶不上老工人。他们的技术水平也比较低，遇到工种变换或技术障碍，往往就不能应付。因此，要让他们在生产中发挥更大的作用，就需要特别注意加强对他们的培养教育工作。营城煤矿领导方面抓紧了这件工作，使新工人的觉悟不断提高，干劲越来越足，学技术的积极性和主动性也越来越大，结果就有力地促进了煤炭的增产。营城煤矿的经验，对目前大多数企业都是有意义的。
    老工人是生产上的骨干。优秀的老工人不论在思想觉悟、技术水平和生产经验上都是值得新工人学习的活榜样。因此，在加强对新工人的教育时，要充分发挥老工人的作用。要发动老工人主动地帮助新工人，把培养教育又红又专的新的一代，以壮大工人阶级队伍，当作自己的光荣的职责。这是做好新工人工作的最重要的一着。
