Xinhua News Agency, 3rd - The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Student Federation held a grand reception at the Beijing Hotel this noon to warmly welcome youth and student representatives from twenty-four countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai arrived at the reception hall during the reception. At this time, young friends from various countries enthusiastically surged towards Premier Zhou Enlai and applauded warmly for a long time to welcome him.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai spoke amidst warm applause. He said that he was very happy to be able to participate in the reception held by Chinese youth organizations for young friends from Asian, African, and Latin American countries. He said that the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries are awakening day by day, and they are standing up heroically. This is a major event in the world and worthy of our warm celebration.

　　Premier Zhou said that since the Second World War, especially since the Bandung Conference, more and more countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have broken free from colonial rule and gained independence. We believe that in this region, many more countries will gain independence. Premier Zhou pointed out that it will take a period of struggle for Asian, African, and Latin American countries to achieve complete independence.

　　Therefore, we must unite closely and carry out a common struggle. The imperialists say that we are backward Asia, backward Africa, and backward Latin America, but with the awakening of our people and our persistent common struggle, we have become advanced Asia, advanced Africa, and advanced Latin America. At this time, the audience burst into prolonged and stormy applause.

　　Premier Zhou said that nowadays more and more people in the world are talking about national independence movements and the struggles of colonial peoples. Even the United Nations is discussing these issues. However, what we demand is genuine recognition of the national independence of all countries, genuine non-interference in the internal affairs of all countries, and genuine recognition of the equal status of Asian, African, and Latin American countries. National oppression and racial discrimination are not allowed. We believe that only a small group of people practice national oppression and racial discrimination, and the majority are our friends. Our friends are all over the world. More than 90% of the people in the world are or may be friends who oppose imperialism and colonialism and safeguard and strive for national independence movements. Colonial rule must end, and national independence movements must triumph. At this time, the reception hall resounded with another long-lasting and stormy applause.

　　Premier Zhou finally proposed a toast for opposing imperialist aggression and safeguarding world peace, for ending the colonial system and safeguarding and striving for national independence, for the great unity of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, for the great unity of the people of the world, and for the health of the young friends from various countries present.

　　As soon as Premier Zhou Enlai finished speaking, a chorus of cheers for peace and friendship resounded in the hall, and the reception reached a joyful climax.

　　The reception began at twelve o'clock. Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke at the reception. He first expressed warm welcome on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Student Federation to the young friends from Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

　　Hu Yaobang said that the people and youth of the world must unite closely and wage a resolute struggle against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism. He said that as long as we unite and wage a resolute struggle, victory will surely belong to us.

　　Hu Yaobang said that the Chinese people and Chinese youth regard the victories of the people and youth of Asian, African, and Latin American countries in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism and for the attainment and safeguarding of national independence as our own victory, as the victory of the youth of the world, and as the victory of the progressive cause of the world.

　　Hu Yaobang said that the Chinese people and Chinese youth will unswervingly struggle resolutely against the war policies and aggressive policies of imperialism, resolutely strive to defend world peace, actively work to achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and contribute our own strength to support the struggle for independence and freedom of all oppressed nations. The Chinese people and youth have always stood, are standing, and will always stand on the side of the just struggles of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries.

　　Captain Fernández Raveiro Monado of the Cuban Socialist Youth League delegation; Rodelfer Murlkas Dolarsa of the Panamanian University Student Union; Minoru Maeda, head of the Japanese Democratic Youth League delegation; Mamuri Mamut of the Tunisian New Constitutional Party delegation; Megsonvis Barobas Nunes of the Venezuelan Youth delegation; N. L. Pereira, head of the Ceylon Communist Youth and Progressive Youth League Federation delegation; Kwasi Ofohanah Akyeampong of the Ghana Youth delegation; Alazi, head of the Niger Youth delegation; Dean Amadi Ali, deputy head of the Black African Students in France delegation; Momangui Dunasian Filis of the Congo African Solidarity Party delegation; Sylvanos Gabba of the Togo Youth delegation; and Geraldo Figueras Larasabal of the Cuban Youth delegation spoke and proposed toasts at the reception one after another. They pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people and youth of the world. The people and youth must unite closely to oppose the aggressive policies and war policies of imperialism, oppose the oppression and exploitation of colonialism, strive for and safeguard the independence of their own nations, and defend world peace.

　　In their toasts, they also expressed the deep friendship of the people and youth of Asian, African, and Latin American countries towards the Chinese people and youth, and thanked the Chinese people and youth for their support of their just struggles. They also raised their glasses to wish the great unity of the people and youth of the world in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism and for the defense of world peace, to wish the friendship between the people and youth of all countries continue to develop and consolidate, and to wish the heroic people and youth of Japan, Cuba, Algeria, and the Congo achieve victory in the struggle against imperialism.

　　After the Cuban representative finished his toast, the audience stood up and shouted for a long time: "Cuba yes, Yankees no!" After the Congolese representative finished his toast, someone shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism that is invading the Congo under the banner of the United Nations!"

　　At the end of the reception, Hu Yaobang shouted: "U.S. imperialism get out of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Long live the great unity of the people and youth of the world!" The young friends from various countries attending the reception applauded enthusiastically with the slogans.

　　Among those attending the reception were: Luo Yi, Hu Keshi, Liang Buting, Yang Haibo, and Wang Zhaohua, Secretaries of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League; Zhang Chao, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation; and Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Student Federation, etc.
