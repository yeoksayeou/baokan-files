    Early Ammonia Production Leads to More Grain
    ——Days of Trial Run in the Synthetic Ammonia Workshop of Dafeng Chemical Plant
    Yu Xing, Shi Tao, You Fu
      In late September, the newly built synthetic ammonia workshop of Dafeng Chemical Plant in Shanghai County—a county-level fertilizer plant with an annual output of 800 tons—entered the full trial run stage. In just half a year, it was born with the enthusiastic support of all walks of life in Shanghai.
    “One pound of ammonia water equals four pounds of grain; early ammonia production leads to more grain.” The Party's call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production gave the workers tremendous encouragement. With a mindset of racing against time, they threw themselves into the battle of trial runs.
    What do difficulties matter!
    On the surface, synthetic ammonia is just the combination of hydrogen and nitrogen. However, it is not easy to combine these two gases with different characteristics. From manufacturing semi-water gas to releasing ammonia water, the gas runs around in the pipes, invisible and intangible. Even a small problem in one link can cause a complete shutdown. This brought many difficulties to the workers of Dafeng Plant, who were dealing with the synthetic ammonia industry for the first time.
    What do difficulties matter! They met them with revolutionary perseverance. Many people worked selflessly, learning and doing at their posts. All sectors of the city also extended a helping hand. Workers from machinery factories and instrument factories helped "diagnose" machines and instruments; commercial personnel supplied raw materials; the Shanghai Science and Technology Association organized technicians to come to the door to impart technology... helping them overcome one technical hurdle after another.
    On the evening of September 30, the workshop was filled with a tense atmosphere. The workers held their breath and stared at the pointer of the electric meter on the wall. The long-awaited ammonia water was about to flow out.
    Suddenly, the rising pointer plummeted, and the electric heating wire in the synthesis tower burned out. Seeing the hard-won fruit fall through, the people's hopeful mood could not help but become heavy.
    Difficulty stood in the way. Should they overcome it and continue to advance, or should they retreat? The county party secretary arrived at the scene in time, giving everyone confidence and strength. People regrouped and carried out emergency repairs. A group of workers set out overnight to find materials in fraternal factories and shops; a group of workers, under the leadership of the branch secretary and the factory director, held a meeting at the tower side and started dismantling. The three-meter-long electric heating wire was installed in the synthesis tower and had to be hoisted from the top of the tower. Su Zhixing, this young worker, stepped forward bravely and climbed the cement pillar in the dark, reaching the top of the two-story-high tower and opening the cover. Everyone put in a lot of effort to take out the electric heating wire.
    At twelve o'clock at night, the Chemical Research Institute received the message. They only had one spare electric heating wire. When they heard that Dafeng Plant was waiting to use it, they decided to put others first and themselves last. Xi Xinhua, a fitter on duty, volunteered to deliver it overnight and help with the installation. The machine roared again, and the pointer on the electric meter rose again.
    Everyone Offers Ideas
    After the new electric heating wire was replaced, the temperature of the synthesis tower slowly rose to 240 degrees Celsius, still about half the temperature needed to produce ammonia water. However, it just wouldn't rise any further, not in one day, not in two. The usual methods of raising the temperature had all been tried. It seemed that ammonia water was going to be "difficult to produce" again.
    The masses were anxious, discussing it everywhere, but for a while, no one could come up with a good idea. The factory Party branch decided to hold a mass hero meeting. Leading cadres, workers, and technicians combined to concentrate their efforts to attack this key problem.
    On the morning of October 5, more than twenty people gathered in a worker's dormitory. Among them were workers from Dafeng Plant, as well as technicians and veteran masters from the Chemical Research Institute. Engineer Zhang analyzed the structure of the synthesis tower in detail. He judged that the problem was inside the tower. Some technicians and workers present also agreed with this view. Since the problem was inside the synthesis tower, a major operation would have to be performed, dismantling the synthesis tower for a comprehensive inspection. This would take a week, and the loss of parts and materials would be great. The workers who were racing against time and focusing on the "Three Autumns" work were reluctant to delay for so many days!
    "Three cobblers are equal to one Zhuge Liang, let alone that we have so many Zhuge Liangs; the problem is inside the tower, can we find a new way to treat the disease without surgery while it is running normally?" Branch Secretary Yan Siwen's words spoke to everyone's heart; everyone thought.
    After a short pause, veteran worker Zhang Huiqing opened his mouth: "There is a way! We can treat the disease without surgery." Then, he talked about his own opinion: "Let's take an ordinary example from life, a 110-volt light bulb, when connected to a 110-volt power supply, it lights up. If you change to a 220-volt light bulb, the filament only glows red but doesn't light up. Our problem is here." After a pause, he continued: "The newly replaced electric heating wire is longer than the previous one, and it requires more electricity. I think that replacing a larger transformer to increase the amount of electricity can raise the temperature."
    The air in the room suddenly became active. Engineers and workers all thought that Master Zhang's opinion was very good, and they could try this method first.
    After the mass hero meeting, many workers set off separately to find this large transformer.
    The Helping Hand
    People bustled for a day and did not find this transformer. It would take at least a month to customize one. Time is grain; it couldn't be delayed! They invited veteran masters from the nearby "August 1st" Motor Factory. After everyone discussed it, they came up with a clever idea: the transformer currently in use still has potential. If a special small transformer is installed next to it to tap that potential, wouldn't the amount of electricity be enough?
    The "August 1st" Motor Factory regarded supporting agriculture as its responsibility. Deputy Factory Director Li Shangen personally led technicians to Shanghai Motor Factory. The other party knew that this was urgently needed equipment for fertilizer production, and said that as long as the factory had it, they would use it first. However, they searched through the warehouse and the workshop, but there was no such voltage transformer. The "August 1st" Motor Factory, which had never made transformers before, decided to manufacture it themselves. The head of the design section and related engineers of Shanghai Motor Factory put down their work and rushed to make drawings for this transformer; the warehouse director took out qualified copper wire and gave it to the "August 1st" factory first.
    The "August 1st" factory urgently mobilized to rush to manufacture the transformer. Lacking equipment, they used indigenous methods. They first encountered the difficulty of winding the copper wire. This copper wire, twisted from multiple strands of copper wire, was as thick as a finger. Without a wire winding frame, they used an exhaust fan frame instead; without a wire releasing frame, people carried it on their backs; the silicon steel sheet on this transformer was as large as a small square table, and the factory did not have a large punching and shearing machine. What to do? The Shanghai Motor Manufacturing School across the street saw the difficulty and offered help. They had two such machines, one of which was broken, and the other was rushing to work, but they also let the "August 1st" factory use it first. This noble style further inspired the "August 1st Motor Factory" workers' enthusiasm. In just thirty-six hours, this transformer was made.
    The next day, the workers happily sent the transformer to Dafeng Factory to help with the installation.
    The transformer emitted a harmonious humming sound, and the warmth of communism spread throughout everyone's hearts. People saw the temperature of the synthesis tower rising from the instrument and were overjoyed. Yan Siwen, the branch secretary of Dafeng Factory, and Li Shangen, the deputy director of the Motor Factory, shook hands tightly in front of the machine.
    It was the Party's wise leadership, the working class's soaring enthusiasm, and the enthusiastic support from all directions that finally enabled the synthetic ammonia workshop to produce the first batch of ammonia water on the evening of October 7, and further produced liquid ammonia with higher concentration on the 12th.
    Leaping People
    From late September to mid-October, from the full trial run to the continuous production of liquid ammonia, in this short period, new workers were also growing rapidly.
    In the workshop, the workers controlled the valves in an orderly manner. In the analysis room, known as the eyes and ears of the workshop, the girls carefully manipulated the glass instruments on the operating table. If it weren't for a prior introduction, who would have known that many of them were farmers not long ago?
    Tang Aijuan and Shen Wanying, these two girls are both twenty years old. In the past, Xiaotang was a member of Sanlin Commune, and Xiaoshen was in Hongqiao Commune. Both of them are now analysis workers. Leaving the fields and coming to the factory, so many precise machines and instruments fascinated them all at once. The young people were excited about the appearance of such a fertilizer plant in their county, and they were also afraid that they would not be able to do this important job well. The Party organization encouraged them, and the veteran masters taught them by holding their hands. Xiaotang and Xiaoshen were focused and eager to learn. After work, they stayed in the workshop to watch others operate, and they did not even bother to go home to visit on their days off.
    Both of them had worked in the fields in the past, and had personally sprinkled fertilizer powder on the land, watching the rice produce large and heavy ears, the cotton burst forth with white fluff, and the fields grow sturdy vegetables, and deeply understood the principle that "crops depend entirely on fertilizer." They said that working in a fertilizer factory was like working in the fields. They both studied hard and practiced diligently, and made rapid progress. Now, the veteran masters also praised them for being basically able to handle things independently.
    On the afternoon of October 21, the sun was shining brightly. The workers of the synthetic ammonia workshop, carrying six hundred pounds of fertilizer powder made from their first batch of liquid ammonia, came to the nearby Maqiao People's Commune, beating gongs and drums. The red banner in their hands was written with fourteen large characters: "Report good news to farmer brothers, send fertilizer for the Three Autumns battle." The commune members warmly welcomed these class brothers from the industrial front with gratitude.
    When Liu Guanshou, deputy secretary of the commune party committee, accepted this precious gift on behalf of the commune members, joyful applause rang out in the fields.

    早出氨水多产粮
    ——在达丰化工厂合成氨车间试车的日子里
    玉兴  世涛　有夫
      9月下旬，上海县达丰化工厂新建的合成氨车间——年产八百吨的县级化肥厂，进入全面的试车阶段。仅仅半年，它在上海各行各业的热情支援下就诞生了。
    “一斤氨水四斤粮，早出氨水多产粮。”党的大办农业、大办粮食的号召，给了工人巨大的鼓舞。他们怀着跟时间赛跑的心情，投入了试车的战斗。
    困难，算啥！
    表面看来，合成氨只是把氢和氮合起来就成了，然而要把这两种性格不同的气体结合在一起，可不是容易的事情。从制造半水煤气到放出氨水，气体在管子里跑来跑去，人们看不见，摸不到。有的环节上出一点小毛病，也会造成全部停工。这，给第一次同合成氨工业打交道的达丰厂的工人带来了不少困难。
    困难，算啥！他们用革命的毅力迎上去。许多人废寝忘食地在自己的岗位上边学、边干。全市各个方面也向他们伸出了援助的手。机械厂、仪表厂的工人帮助“诊断”机器、仪表；商业人员供应原料、材料；上海科学技术协会组织技术人员上门传授技术……帮助他们闯过了一道又一道的技术关。
    9月30日晚上，车间里弥漫着紧张的气氛。工人们屏息静气，凝视着壁上电表的指针，渴望已久的氨水就快流出来了。
    突然，正在上升的指针猛跌下来，合成塔的电热丝烧断了。眼看好不容易到手的果实落了空，人们满怀希望的心情，禁不住沉重起来。
    困难横在面前，是克服它继续前进，还是退缩？县委书记及时赶到现场，给了大家信心和力量。人们重整旗鼓，紧急抢修。一批工人漏夜出发，到兄弟工厂和商店寻找材料；一批工人在支部书记、厂长领导下，开了塔边会议，动手拆卸。三米长的电热丝装在合成塔里，必须从塔的顶端吊出来。苏志兴，这个年青工人，挺身而出，勇敢地摸黑攀着水泥柱，登上二层楼高的塔顶，揭开盖子。大家费了很大的劲把电热丝取了出来。
    深夜十二时，化工研究院得到讯息。他们只有一根备用的电热丝，听说达丰厂等着用，就决定来个先人后己。正在值班的钳工奚新华，自告奋勇连夜送去，帮助安装。机器重新怒吼，电表上的指针又升上来了。
    大家出主意
    新的电热丝换上以后，合成塔的温度徐徐升到摄氏二百四十度，距离出氨水的温度还差一半左右。但是，一天、两天，再也升不上去。一般提高温度的办法都已用过，看来，氨水又要“难产”了。
    群众很着急，到处议论纷纷，可一时谁也想不出条妙计来。工厂党支部决定召开一次群英会。领导干部、工人和技术人员三结合，集中力量围攻这个关键。
    10月5日上午，二十多个人聚集在一间工人寝室里。其中有达丰厂的工人，也有化工研究院的技术人员和老师傅。章工程师详细分析了合成塔的结构。他判断毛病就在塔内。在场的有些技术人员和工人也赞同这种看法。既然毛病在合成塔里面，就得动大手术，拆开合成塔全面检查，这样就要花一个星期的时间，机件、物料的损耗也很大。正在争分夺秒、一心赶“三秋”的工人，哪舍得拖延这么些天！
    “三个皮匠顶上一个诸葛亮，何况我们有那么多诸葛亮；毛病出在塔里面，能不能在照常运转的情况下，找出一条治病的新方法呢？”支部书记阎嗣文的话，说到每个人的心里；大家思索着。
    稍停，老工人张惠卿开口了：“有办法！不开刀也能治病。”接着，他谈出了自己的意见：“我们不妨举一个生活中的普通例子，110伏的电灯泡，接在110伏的电源上就亮了，如果换一只220伏的灯泡，灯丝只红不亮。我们的毛病就在这里。”停顿了一下，他又继续说下去：“新换上的电热丝比前一根长，需要的电量也多。我看把变压器换一只大的，增加了电量，就能提高温度。”
    房间里的空气，顿时活跃起来。工程师、工人都认为张师傅的见解很好，可以用这种办法先试一试。
    群英会开过后，许多工人分头出发，物色这种大的变压器。
    支援的手
    人们奔忙一天，没有找到这种变压器。定做一台，至少得一个多月。时间就是粮，不能拖下去！他们请来附近“八一”电机厂的老师傅，大家一商量，想出了个巧办法：现在用的那台变压器还有潜力，如果旁边安一台特殊的小变压器，挖出这些潜力，电量不就够用了吗？
    “八一”电机厂把支援农业看成是自己应负的责任。副厂长李善根亲自带领技术员赶到上海电机厂。对方知道这是生产化肥急需的设备，表示只要厂里有，尽先拿去使用。可是仓库里、车间里都找过了，没有这种压变器。从未做过变压器的“八一”电机厂决定自己动手制造。上海电机厂的设计科长和有关工程师放下手中的事情，特地为这种变压器赶制图样；仓库主任拿出符合规格的铜丝，先给“八一”厂用。
    “八一”厂紧急动员，突击制造变压器。缺乏设备，就土法上马。他们首先碰到绕铜丝的困难。这种多股铜丝拧成的铜线，有一只手指粗。没有绕丝架，用排气风扇架子代替；没有放线架，就由人背在身上放；这种变压器上的矽钢片要小方桌那么大，厂里没有大冲剪机，怎么办？对门的上海电机制造学校见难相助，他们有两台这样的机器，一台坏了，一台正在赶工，但他们也让给“八一”厂先用。这种高贵的风格，更加激励了“八一电机厂”工人们的干劲。仅仅三十六个小时，这台变压器就造出来了。
    第二天，工人们兴高采烈地将变压器送到达丰厂帮助安装。
    变压器发出和谐的嗡嗡声，共产主义的暖流通遍每个人的心田。人们从仪表上看到合成塔的温度升起来，欣喜若狂。达丰厂支部书记阎嗣文和电机厂副厂长李善根，在机器面前紧紧握手。
    是党的英明领导，是工人阶级的冲天干劲，是四面八方的热情支援，合成氨车间终于在10月7日傍晚流出了第一批氨水，12日又进一步做出浓度更高的液氨。
    跃进的人
    从9月下旬到10月中旬，从全面试车到液氨源源不断地生产出来，在这短短的时间里，新工人也迅速在成长着。
    车间里，工人们有条不紊地控制着阀门。被称为车间耳目的分析室里，姑娘们细心地摆弄着操作台上的玻璃仪器。要不是预先介绍，谁看得出他们当中的许多人不久以前还是农民？
    汤爱娟和沈婉英，这两个姑娘年纪都是二十岁，过去，小汤是三林公社社员，小沈在虹桥公社。两个人现在都是分析工。离开田野来到工厂，那么多又那么精密的机器、仪器，一下子把她们迷住了。年青人为自己县里出现这样的化肥厂感到兴奋，也生怕自己难以胜任这份重要的工作。党组织鼓励她们，老师傅把着手教导她们。小汤、小沈专心又虚心。下班了，还留在车间看别人操作，休息日子也顾不得回家探望。
    两个人过去都在田里干过活，曾经亲手把肥田粉撒在土地上，眼看稻子结出又大又重的谷穗，棉花吐放洁白的棉絮，田里长出茁壮的蔬菜，深深懂得“庄稼一支花，全靠肥当家”的道理。她们说，在肥料厂工作就像是在田里。她们都勤学苦练，进步很快。现在，老师傅也称赞她们基本上能够独当一面了。
    10月21日下午，阳光灿烂。合成氨车间的工人带着他们用第一批液氨做出的六百斤肥田粉，敲锣打鼓来到附近的马桥人民公社。他们手中的红布横幅上，写着十四个大字：“向农民兄弟报喜，为三秋大战送肥”。社员们怀着感激的心情，热烈欢迎这些来自工业战线的阶级弟兄。
    当公社党委副书记刘关寿代表社员接受这份珍贵的礼品时，田野上响起欢乐的掌声。
