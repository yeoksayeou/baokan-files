Xinhua News Agency, October 6th: Montevideo - Ben Youcef Ben Khedda, head of the Algerian delegation visiting Latin America, condemned U.S. interference in the Algerian people's national liberation war at a press conference held in Uruguay on the 4th before leaving the country. He said that the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are the main supporters of the French colonialists and are responsible for the continuation of the Algerian war. He also condemned the French ambassadors to Latin American countries for putting pressure on the governments of these countries and for not granting visas to the Algerian delegation for visits.

Ben Youcef Ben Khedda told reporters in an exclusive interview that during my visits to Latin American countries, I noticed that the Algerian cause is extremely popular. The Algerian people's heroic struggle for their national independence is greatly admired and deeply sympathized with. He said that this is because there is a very strong anti-colonial sentiment in Latin American countries, and they have personally experienced the suffering of colonial rule.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 5th: United Arab Republic (UAR) President Nasser said today upon returning to Cairo after attending the UN General Assembly in New York, "The UAR supports the struggle of the Algerian people and their right to independence." He said, "The principles adopted by the Bandung Conference five years ago are the principles we still follow. We find that the problems we encountered at that time still exist today. They were created by imperialism."

Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, October 4th: The delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria to Morocco held a press conference here tonight, introducing eleven soldiers who recently deserted from the French invading army's Foreign Legion to the press, powerfully exposing the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization's support for France's war of aggression against Algeria.

Among these soldiers, eight are from West Germany and one is Portuguese.

Mustafa Shaki, head of the Algerian delegation, said at the press conference: The defection of these soldiers "clearly demonstrates the heinous role played by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the Algerian war." He pointed out that the Foreign Legion soldiers in the French army in Algeria are NATO soldiers.

He announced that since 1956, the number of French Foreign Legion soldiers who have defected to the Algerian National Liberation Army has been increasing. The Algerian National Liberation Army has repatriated more than 5,000 foreign soldiers from the eastern and western borders to their countries of origin or to a country that will accommodate them.

Al-Alawi, Moroccan Minister of Information and Tourism and Vice President of the Moroccan Red Crescent Society, also spoke at the reception. He expressed the Moroccan people's support for the Algerian people's struggle for independence and condemned the colonial war waged by the French army in Algeria. He emphasized that this war is unjust. Any country that helps France wage this war should be considered an accomplice.

    据新华社6日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：访问拉丁美洲的阿尔及利亚代表团团长本·优素福·本赫达4日在离乌拉圭前举行的记者招待会上谴责美国干涉阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放战争。他说，美国和北大西洋集团是法国殖民者的主要支持者和使阿尔及利亚战争继续下去的负责者。他还谴责法国驻拉丁美洲国家的大使向这些国家的政府施加压力，以及不给予阿尔及利亚代表团进行访问的签证。
    本·优素福·本赫达对单独访问他的记者说，我在访问拉丁美洲各国的过程中注意到，阿尔及利亚的事业极得人心。阿尔及利亚人民为争取自己的民族独立而进行的英勇斗争，受到极大的钦佩和深刻的同情。他说，这是由于在拉丁美洲各国存在着非常强烈的反殖民主义情绪，拉丁美洲各国亲身经历过殖民统治的苦楚。
    据新华社开罗5日电　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔今天在纽约参加联大会议后回到开罗时说，“阿联支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争和他们的独立权利。”他说，“五年前万隆会议所通过的原则是我们现在仍然遵循的原则。我们发现，当时我们遇到的问题，现在仍然存在。那是帝国主义制造出来的。”
    据新华社拉巴特4日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府驻摩洛哥代表团今晚在这里举行记者招待会，把十一名最近脱离法国侵略军外籍军团的士兵介绍给报界，有力地揭露了以美国为首的北大西洋集团支持法国侵略阿尔及利亚的战争。
    在这些士兵中，有八名来自西德和一名葡萄牙人。
    阿尔及利亚代表团团长穆斯塔法·沙基在招待会上说：这些士兵的投诚，“明显地表明了北大西洋公约组织在阿尔及利亚战争中所起的罪恶作用。”他指出，在阿尔及利亚的法军中的外籍军团士兵，就是北大西洋公约组织的士兵。
    他宣布：自1956年以来，向阿尔及利亚民族解放军投诚的法军外籍士兵日益增多。阿尔及利亚民族解放军已把五千多名外籍士兵从东部和西部边境遣返回他们所属的国家或者送往一个收容他们的国家。
    摩洛哥新闻和游历大臣、摩洛哥红新月会副会长阿劳维也在招待会上讲了话。他表示摩洛哥人民支持为争取独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民，并且谴责在阿尔及利亚的法军所进行的殖民战争。他强调指出：这场战争是不正义的。帮助法国进行这场战争的任何国家都应该被认为是同谋者。
