Xinhua News Agency report: In Jiangsu Province, amidst a vigorous effort to boost grain production, green manure is being widely planted from the south to the north, with the total area sown in spring, summer, and autumn exceeding any previous year. This unprecedented expansion of green manure acreage not only provides a significant amount of high-quality fertilizer for this year's grain crops but also prepares even more high-quality base fertilizer for increased grain production next year.

In recent years, Jiangsu Province has achieved significant success in implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," ensuring the continuous leap forward in grain production. This year, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted in-depth investigations and research on the implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" in various regions, and believes that with the significant improvement of water conservancy conditions, focusing on fertilizer, especially high-quality fertilizer, is a major key to ensuring the continued leap forward in grain production.

Previously, summer green manure was not planted in the southern Jiangsu region, and it was also planted very little in the northern Jiangsu region. In 1959, when the summer green manure planting area was the largest, it was only 800,000 mu. This year, this old habit has been broken, and both the south and north of Jiangsu are doing everything possible to plant summer green manure on a large scale. According to incomplete statistics, the province has planted a total of 2.53 million mu of summer green manure (excluding aquatic green manure), an increase of more than two times compared with the same period last year.

In order to have more high-quality base fertilizer for spring and summer planting next year, various regions are arranging autumn planting of grain crops, and while ensuring the expansion of the grain crop area, they are seizing the time to continue to expand the autumn planting of green manure in every possible way. The people's communes in the Suzhou area have already intercropped 500,000 mu of green manure in late rice fields. Yancheng area, which used to plant less green manure, had sown more than 600,000 mu of green manure crops by mid-September.

This year, in the expansion of green manure production in Jiangsu Province, Party committees at all levels have strengthened specific leadership over green manure production and adopted the method of launching mass movements to engage in green manure production. Various regions have used methods such as mass discussions, on-site meetings, and setting up pacesetters to launch mass movements for large-scale green manure planting that are larger in scale from one season to the next. At the same time, in the process of expanding green manure production, a set of planting methods suitable for local conditions has been created.

Nanchang, October 21st (reported by this newspaper) Jiangxi Province has launched a massive autumn fertilizer accumulation and production campaign to prepare sufficient base fertilizer as early as possible for large-scale grain production in winter.

This year, Jiangxi Province is implementing the spirit of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and is determined to change the past "small planting and small harvest" of winter crops to "large planting and large harvest." The province plans to expand the winter sowing area, mainly winter wheat, miscellaneous grains, and oil crops, much more than last year. To ensure both planting a large area and planting well, the most important measure is to focus on fertilizer. The Provincial Party Committee requires all regions to accumulate at least 20 to 40 dan of standard base fertilizer per mu of winter crops before winter planting, the more the better. Therefore, all regions have strengthened leadership, with the Party secretaries at all levels personally taking charge, mobilizing the masses to implement the quantity, quality, and time of fertilizer accumulation according to the winter planting area, and organizing and transferring a total of approximately 1 million commune members to participate in the fertilizer accumulation and production campaign. In the accumulation and production of fertilizer, all regions attach great importance to improving the quality of fertilizer, and all kinds of grass fertilizer and miscellaneous fertilizer are mixed with household fertilizer and then composted to make them rot and ferment; grey fertilizer is stored in sheds to prevent fertilizer efficiency loss.

Focusing on the large-scale production of indigenous chemical fertilizer with guaranteed quality is an important aspect of fertilizer accumulation and production. While focusing on the intensive accumulation and production of farm manure, various regions are arranging manpower and material resources to produce chemical fertilizer on a large scale. Now many regions have reached the point where every commune has a factory and every team has a factory, stepping up the production of various indigenous chemical fertilizers. (Attached photo)

### 肥料多多益善  江苏绿肥种植面积超过往年  江西秋季积肥运动声势浩大

    肥料多多益善
    江苏绿肥种植面积超过往年
    江西秋季积肥运动声势浩大
    据新华社讯　江苏省在大办粮食中，从江南到苏北大种绿肥，全省今年春季、夏季和秋季播种的绿肥作物，超过了历史上任何一年。绿肥面积的空前扩大，不仅给今年种植的粮食作物提供了比较多的优质肥料，同时也给明年的粮食增产准备了更多的优质基肥。
    几年来，江苏省在贯彻农业“八字宪法”中获得了很大成绩，保证了粮食生产的持续跃进。今年，中共江苏省委对全省各地执行农业“八字宪法”的情况，深入作了调查研究，认为在水利条件有了很大改善的情况下，大抓肥料，特别是大抓优质肥料，是当前保证粮食生产持续跃进的一个重大关键。
    以前，苏南地区不种夏绿肥，苏北地区种得也很少，全省夏绿肥种植面积最多的1959年，也只有八十万亩。今年，这个老习惯被打破了，不论是江南还是苏北，都千方百计地大种夏绿肥。据不完全统计，全省共种植夏绿肥二百五十三万亩（不包括水生绿肥），比去年同期增加了两倍多。
    为了使明年春种、夏种拥有更多的优质基肥，各地安排秋种粮食作物的同时，在保证扩大粮食作物面积的前提下，正抓紧时机继续千方百计地扩大秋种绿肥。苏州专区各人民公社已经在晚稻田里套种了五十万亩绿肥。过去种绿肥较少的盐城专区，到9月中旬，已播种了六十多万亩绿肥作物。
    江苏省今年在扩大绿肥生产中，各级党委加强了对绿肥生产的具体领导，并且采用了大抓群众运动的方法来搞绿肥生产。各地都用群众大讨论、开现场会、树立标兵等方法，掀起了一季比一季规模更大的大种绿肥的群众运动。同时，在扩大绿肥生产过程中，创造了一套因地制宜的种植方法。
    本报南昌21日电　江西省掀起声势浩大的秋季积肥造肥运动，为冬季大办粮食及早备足基肥。
    今年江西省贯彻大办农业、大办粮食的精神，决心变历年冬种作物“小种小收”为“大种大收”，全省计划今年冬小麦、杂粮和油料作物为主的冬播作物面积将比去年扩大很多。既保多种又保种好，首先最重要的措施就是抓好肥料。省委要求各地在冬种以前，最低要为每亩冬种作物积足二十担到四十担标准基肥，多多益善。因此，各地都加强了领导，由各级党委书记亲自挂帅，发动群众按冬种面积落实了积肥数量、质量和时间，并组织和抽调了共约一百余万社员投入积肥造肥运动。各地在积肥造肥中十分重视提高肥料质量，对各种草肥杂肥都摘拌家肥进行了压沤，使之腐烂发酵；对灰肥搭棚储存，防止肥效流失。
    保质保量大抓土化肥，是积肥造肥的一个重要方面。各地在突击积造农家肥的同时，安排人力、物力大造化肥。现在许多地区都达到了社社有厂、队队有厂，加紧生产各种土化肥。（附图片）
