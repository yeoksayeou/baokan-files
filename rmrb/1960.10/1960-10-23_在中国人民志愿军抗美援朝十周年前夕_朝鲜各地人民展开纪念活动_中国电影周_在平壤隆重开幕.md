Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd. According to the Korean Central News Agency: People in various parts of northern Korea held lectures and symposiums to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's entry into Korea to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. A lecture was held in Hamhung City on the 19th. Jeong Myeong-won, an amateur lecturer from the Hamhung City Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, gave a lecture entitled "Further Strengthening the Proletarian Internationalist Friendship and Solidarity Between the People of Korea and China." In his lecture, Jeong Myeong-won pointed out the great historical significance of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the Korean War. He said that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army defended every hill and village in Korea as if they were defending their own motherland's territory. In the battles against the enemy, they demonstrated collective heroism, established great achievements, and became a vivid example of proletarian internationalism. He said that the friendship and solidarity between the people of Korea and China, forged with blood, is eternal.

    Workers at the Pyongyang Silk Weaving Factory held a symposium on the 21st. Kim Gye-hak, a worker in the worsted spinning workshop, recalled his experience of fighting alongside the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Battle of Kimhwa during the war. He said that he would never forget the heroic achievements established by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in sharing life and death with the Korean people.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd. The "Chinese Film Week," jointly organized by the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korea-China Friendship Association to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's entry into Korea to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, grandly opened tonight at the Daedongmun Cinema in Pyongyang.

    From today until the 28th, cinemas throughout Korea will screen nearly forty Chinese art films, including "Shangganling," "Celebrating Ten Years," "Daughter of the Party," "Storm," "Song of Youth," "Five Heroes of Langya Mountain," "The Old Soldier's New Story," "Soaring Together," "Heroic Intrepidity," as well as "Five Golden Flowers," and "Young People in Our Village." About half of them are color films.

    Cho Ling-chool, Vice Minister of Education and Culture of Korea, said in his speech at the opening ceremony: During the Korean Fatherland Liberation War, the great internationalist fighters - the Chinese People's Volunteer Army - overcame all kinds of difficulties together with the Korean People's Army. They carried out heroic battles against the common enemy, the U.S. imperialist aggressors. Because the people of Korea and China won the victory in the Korean War, they completely shattered the myth of the "strength" of U.S. imperialism, staunchly defended the eastern outpost of the socialist camp, and made contributions to the cause of peace in the Far East and the world.  At that same time, this victory proved that any aggression by imperialists against the socialist camp will inevitably end in a miserable failure.

    He said: The thorough internationalist fighters – the Chinese People's Volunteer Army warriors, nurtured and educated by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, cherished every mountain, river, plant and tree in Korea. They displayed unparalleled bravery and collectivism in the struggle against the enemy. When the Korean people raised the shovels of restoration and construction on the post-war ruins, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, regardless of the fatigue of the war, actively helped the Korean people on the construction sites with the mood of rebuilding their own homes. He said that the great achievements established in blood by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on Korean soil, and the friendship of the Chinese people towards the Korean people, will forever live in the hearts of the Korean people.

    Li Lin, Cultural Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, also spoke. He said that the people of China and Korea have a traditional and profound friendship. Whether in the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace, or in socialist construction, they have always stood closely together, helping each other, supporting each other, and advancing together. He said that the friendship between China and Korea is a noble friendship based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and a friendship forged in blood. This friendship is as solid as a rock and unbreakable. Subsequently, the Chinese art film "Nameless Island" and the large-scale documentary "Immortal Achievements" were shown at the opening ceremony.

    Attending the opening ceremony of the Chinese Film Week today were: Kim Jong-heng, Minister of Higher Education of Korea and Vice Chairman of the Korea-China Friendship Association, Ryu Jang-sik, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Choi Sung-sook, Vice Chairman of the Korean Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations, Park Pal-yang, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Writers' Union, and officers of the People's Army.

    Liu Xianglun, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, and diplomatic officials from various countries' embassies in Korea also attended the opening ceremony.

    新华社平壤22日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国教育文化省和朝中友好协会为纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝入朝参战十周年联合举办的“中国电影周”，今天晚上在平壤市大同门电影院隆重开幕。

    朝鲜教育文化省副相赵灵出在开幕式上致词说：在朝鲜祖国解放战争时期，伟大的国际主义战士——中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民军一道克服了各种艰难困苦。为反对共同的敌人美帝国主义侵略军进行了英勇的战斗。由于朝中两国人民在朝鲜战争中取得了胜利，彻底粉碎了美帝国主义“强大”的神话，钢铁般地保卫了社会主义阵营的东方前哨，为远东和世界和平事业作出了贡献。同时，这一胜利又证明了帝国主义者对社会主义阵营的任何侵略也必将以悲惨的失败而告终。
    他说：中国共产党和毛泽东主席哺育教养的彻底的国际主义战士——中国人民志愿军勇士们，爱惜了朝鲜的一山一水，一草一木。在同敌人的斗争中发挥了无比的勇敢和集体主义精神。当朝鲜人民在战后废墟上举起恢复建设的铁锨时，中国人民志愿军不顾战争的疲劳，以重建自己家园的心情在朝鲜的工地上积极地帮助了朝鲜人民。他说：中国人民志愿军在朝鲜土地上以鲜血树立的丰功伟绩，中国人民对朝鲜人民的友情，将永远活在朝鲜人民心中。
    中国驻朝鲜大使馆文化参赞李林也讲了话。他说，中朝两国人民有着传统的深厚友谊。不论是在反对美帝国主义的侵略和保卫世界和平的斗争中，或是在社会主义的建设中，始终是紧密地站在一起，互相帮助，互相支持，共同前进。他说，中朝两国的友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的崇高的友谊，是用鲜血凝成的友谊。这种友谊坚如磐石，牢不可破。随后，在开幕式上放映了中国艺术片“无名岛”和大型纪录片“不朽的功勋”。
