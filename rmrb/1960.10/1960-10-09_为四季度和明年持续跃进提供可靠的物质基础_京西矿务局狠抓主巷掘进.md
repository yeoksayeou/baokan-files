To provide a reliable material foundation for the continuous leap forward in the fourth quarter and next year, the Jingxi Mining Bureau is vigorously grasping main tunnel excavation.

    Having overfulfilled this year’s state mining plan in eight and a half months, the Jingxi Mining Bureau, while tightly grasping current coal production, is focusing on excavation work, with an emphasis on main tunnel development, to create conditions for a sustained leap forward in the next two months and next year. Currently, the bureau's number of coal extraction working faces has increased from 56 three months ago to 60, and the available coal extraction period has increased from more than three months to more than four months.

    The bureau's raw coal output and total excavation footage for the first nine months of this year increased by 38.76% and 43.59%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. The workers have summarized an important lesson from their production practice: the greater the extent of the production leap forward, the more excavation work must be strengthened, and the key to strengthening excavation work lies in first grasping the main tunnel excavation, because the main tunnel is the first process of coal production. Only by developing the main tunnel can we sequentially excavate the coal seams. To this end, the bureau's Party committee has taken five measures: First, strengthen leadership over excavation work and increase manpower in the excavation teams; second, mobilize the masses to launch a rapid excavation competition to quickly transform advanced excavation levels into universal levels; third, direct the spearhead of technical innovation towards main tunnel excavation, vigorously summarize and promote advanced experience, and reform excavation technology; fourth, improve excavation management and do everything possible to tap the potential of the existing excavation teams; fifth, mobilize and organize all relevant departments to vigorously support excavation work, so that it can develop faster and better.

    Currently, the bureau has established a command system responsible for excavation work. From the bureau to the mines, production preparation offices have been established under the direct leadership of the Party committee. Leading cadres at all levels personally went to the excavation front line, mobilized the masses to discuss and formulate excavation plans and specific measures, and fixed and strengthened the excavation teams. At present, the number of excavators in the entire bureau has increased by more than 10% compared to the past.

    On this basis, a wave of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced has been set off between mines, teams, and individuals. Through the competition, a large number of advanced experiences have been summarized and widely promoted. In particular, there have been many improvements in rock excavation, which is the main target of innovation. Blasting in rock excavation takes the longest time, and the number, depth, angle, and distribution of holes have a great impact on processes such as blasting, slag removal, and pillar support. Therefore, each mine mobilized the masses to attack the operation of this key process. The excavating workers of the Muchengjian Coal Mine, while experimenting with new methods of deep-hole drilling, organized performance competitions to summarize and promote advanced experiences such as "eight-hole notching." The rock excavation efficiency of the entire mine in the second half of August increased by 14% compared to the first half of the month. Each mine also adopted methods such as staggered operations and parallel operations, so that the efficiency of each process, which has been improved, can be closely connected and coordinated, further improving the excavation level.

    In order to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of each excavator, the bureau is universally establishing a worker administrator system in the excavation teams, and at the same time, is gradually changing the past practice of assigning tasks temporarily when going to work, and implementing a job responsibility system, so as to facilitate workers to carry out preparation work and technical research. Many excavating workers have established labor cards, so that they have a clear idea of their daily work plans and work efficiency, which greatly promotes the development of quota management and competition appraisal work, and makes fuller use of working hours. Relevant auxiliary departments have also vigorously improved management to adapt to the development needs of excavation work. The transportation department strengthened vehicle dispatching, and adopted methods such as dedicated personnel and vehicles to ensure that stone slag and coal in the excavated roadways are transported out in a timely manner. The machinery, electrical, and materials departments have established underground repair stations and underground material distribution rooms to better serve excavation work.

    After taking these measures, two significant changes have taken place in the bureau's production: the growth rate of the main tunnel footage has caught up with the growth rate of the coal tunnel footage, so that the growth rate of the overall excavation has caught up with the growth rate of output. From August 16 to September 15, in 30 days, the average daily raw coal output level of the entire bureau increased by 1.57% compared with the previous 30 days, and the daily excavation footage level increased by 8.67%; achieving excavation first. In this way, the bureau's production is becoming more and more proactive, and the output since August has been higher than the previous ten days, providing a material foundation for the continuous leap forward in the fourth quarter and next year.

    为四季度和明年持续跃进提供可靠的物质基础
    京西矿务局狠抓主巷掘进
    本报讯　以八个半月的时间超额完成今年国家采掘计划的京西矿务局，在抓紧当前煤炭生产的同时，大抓以主巷开拓为重点的掘进工作，为今后两个多月和明年持续跃进创造条件。现在，这个局的回采工作面已从三个月前的五十六个增加到六十个，获得煤量的可采期限从三个多月增加到四个月以上。
    这个局今年前九个月的原煤产量和掘进总进尺比去年同期分别增长了38.76％和43.59％。职工们从生产实践中总结出一条重要经验：生产跃进的幅度越大，掘进工作越要加强，而加强掘进工作的关键，又在于首先抓紧主巷掘进，因为主巷是煤炭生产的第一道工序，只有把主巷开拓出来，才能循序掘进煤巷。为此，这个局的党委采取了五项措施：一、加强对掘进工作的领导，增加掘进队伍的人力；二、发动群众大搞快速掘进竞赛，促使先进掘进水平迅速变为普遍水平；三、把技术革新的矛头引向主巷掘进，大力总结推广先进经验，改革掘进技术；四、改进掘进管理，千方百计挖掘现有掘进队伍的潜力；五、发动和组织各有关部门大力支援，使掘进工作得到更快更好的发展。
    现在，这个局已建立了负责掘进工作的指挥系统。从局到矿都成立了由党委亲自领导的生产准备办公室。各级领导干部亲自深入掘进第一线，发动群众讨论制定了掘进计划和具体措施，固定和壮大了掘进队伍。目前全局掘进人数已比过去增加了10％以上。
    在这个基础上，矿与矿、组与组、人与人之间，都掀起了学先进、赶先进的竞赛热潮。通过竞赛，大量先进经验被总结成套，广泛推广。特别是作为革新主攻目标的岩石掘进，有了许多改进。岩石掘进中打眼的时间最长，而打眼的数量、深度、角度和位置分布，又对放炮、清渣、支柱等工序有很大影响，各矿就发动群众，猛攻这个关键工序的操作。木城涧煤矿的掘进工人，一面试验深孔打眼的新方法，一面组织表演赛，总结推广“八眼掏槽”等先进经验，全矿8月后半月的岩石掘进效率比前半月提高了14％。各矿还采取了交叉作业、平行作业等方法，使经过改进提高了效率的各个工序之间，能够密切衔接配合，进一步提高了掘进水平。
    为了充分发挥每个掘进工人的积极性和创造性，全局正在掘进组中普遍建立工人管理员的制度，同时逐步改变过去上班临时派活的做法，实行工种负责制，以便于工人进行准备工作和开展技术研究。许多掘进工人建立了劳动卡片，做到对自己每天的工作计划和工作效率心中有数，大大促进了定额管理和竞赛评比工作的开展，使工时得到了更加充分的利用。各有关辅助部门也大力改进管理，适应掘进工作的发展需要。运输部门加强车辆调度，采取专人、专车等办法，保证把掘进巷道中的石渣、煤炭及时运出。机电、材料部门纷纷设立井下修理站、井下发料房，更好地为掘进工作服务。
    采取了这些措施以后，这个局的生产出现了两大显著变化：主巷进尺增长的速度，赶上了煤巷进尺的增长速度，从而使全局掘进增长的速度，赶上了产量增长的速度。8月16日到9月15日的三十天内，全局原煤平均日产水平比前三十天增长了1.57％，掘进日进尺水平则增长了8.67％；做到了掘进先行。这样，全局生产越来越主动，8月以来产量一旬高过一旬，为第四季度和明年的持续跃进提供了物质基础。
