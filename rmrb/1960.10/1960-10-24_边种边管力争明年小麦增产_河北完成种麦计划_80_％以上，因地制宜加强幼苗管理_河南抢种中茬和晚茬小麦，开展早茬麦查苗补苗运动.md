Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 22nd: Hebei Province's wheat sowing has entered its final and crucial stage. As of the 15th, the province had completed over 80% of its wheat planting plan. Currently, various regions are simultaneously rushing to plant late-season wheat and strengthening the management of early-sown wheat fields, striving to plant adequately and well, ensuring that every plot has full and strong seedlings.

Due to early-stage drought this year, there are more late-season crops, leading to an uneven progress of wheat sowing across the province. Some areas have completed or nearly completed their wheat planting plans, while others have only completed 70%. To ensure that wheat is planted adequately and well before the Frost's Descent solar term, all regions are concentrating their main efforts, focusing on tackling weak areas as the primary objective of the current wheat sowing effort. Six counties, including Yi County and Zhuo County, have collectively dispatched over 300 secretaries at all levels, leading over 5,400 cadres to go deep into areas with heavier tasks to guide the rush planting.

While rushing to plant, various regions are adopting the approach of managing alongside planting, strengthening seedling management according to local conditions. Six counties, including Fengrun, have also promptly replanted wheat fields with incomplete seedling emergence. The Handan area effectively promoted field management work through "four checks and four supplements": checking seedling emergence and supplementing missing seedlings, checking soil moisture and supplementing irrigation, checking fertilizer and supplementing topdressing, and checking ground works and supplementing furrowing. Ci County and Daming County have fully supplemented the base fertilizer for some wheat fields with insufficient base fertilizer by adopting the method of applying fertilizer in rows. The Tianjin area, which has more wheat fields in low-lying saline-alkali land, after basically completing the wheat planting plan, focused on the characteristics of having more dryland wheat, more wheat in low-lying alkaline land, and more intercropping and relay cropping. Various counties launched field management campaigns to roll and harrow early-sown wheat, cultivate low-lying alkaline land wheat, and supplement fertilizer for intercropped wheat fields. Jiahe County mobilized the masses to summarize experiences in protecting seedlings in alkaline land, and strengthened field management by adopting measures such as early watering, cultivating, and topdressing.

During field management, various regions also paid special attention to preventing and controlling underground pests. Regions where pests have already occurred generally used poisoned bait and poisoned grain for control. Tianjin area, adhering to the spirit of preventing if there are no pests and rushing to treat if there are pests, conducted a comprehensive treatment of wheat fields where pests have already occurred or will occur.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, October 22nd: People's communes in various parts of Henan Province, adhering to the spirit of "grasping progress with one hand and quality with the other," after basically completing the sowing of early-season wheat, quickly shifted to the battle of rushing to plant mid- and late-season wheat, and simultaneously launched a wheat field management campaign centered on checking seedlings and replanting. Efforts are being made to ensure that mid-season wheat catches up with early-season wheat, late-season wheat is not late, and early-season wheat has full, uniform, strong seedlings on every mu.

Statistics as of the 18th showed that the sown wheat area in the province accounted for 56% of the planned wheat planting area. Currently, after successfully completing the sowing of early-season wheat, various regions have mobilized labor and adopted the method of fertilizing, deep plowing, leveling, furrowing, soaking and mixing seeds, and sowing simultaneously, rushing to plant mid- and late-season wheat.

To fully exploit the potential of labor, animal power, and tools in wheat planting, various regions have generally adopted clever use, clever application, and clever arrangements, greatly improving work efficiency and quality. To ensure balanced development in wheat planting progress, competitions comparing progress and quality have also been launched between communes and teams.

While rushing to plant and planting well mid- and late-season wheat, various regions have also actively carried out early-season wheat seedling checking and replanting activities. Xinxiang, Kaifeng, Nanyang, Xuchang and other regions have successively launched mass movements for large-scale wheat sowing inspections, large-scale evaluations, and learning while inspecting, and remedial movements. Shangqiu County also organized cadres and commune member representatives in production brigades to go deep into the fields and conduct inspections of early-sown wheat on a square-by-square basis. Through inspection, Zhouzhuang Brigade of Songji Commune replanted or resowed some wheat fields with missing seedlings and broken ridges. In response to the characteristic that wheat in alkaline land is not easy to emerge, Longhusi Brigade of Longhusi Commune in Minquan County adopted three measures—pest control, alkali suppression, and replanting—for more than 2,400 mu of alkaline land wheat that had been sown. Over 200 laborers were organized to strengthen management in a timely manner. And the missing seedlings were supplemented by connecting the ridges and replanting.

    边种边管力争明年小麦增产
    河北完成种麦计划80％以上，因地制宜加强幼苗管理
    河南抢种中茬和晚茬小麦，开展早茬麦查苗补苗运动
    据新华社天津22日电　河北省小麦播种已进入最后紧要阶段。到15日止，全省已完成种麦计划83％以上。目前，各地正一面抢种晚茬麦，一面加强对早播麦田的管理，力争种足种好，块块苗齐苗壮。
    今年由于前期干旱，晚茬作物较多，全省各地种麦进度很不平衡。有的地区已完成或接近完成种麦计划，有的地区只完成70％。为了力争在霜降以前把小麦种足种好，各地都集中主要力量，把突击薄弱环节作为当前种麦的主攻方面。易县、涿县等六个县共抽调三百多名各级书记，率领五千四百多名干部，深入到任务较大的地区领导抢种。
    各地在抢种的同时，采取前边种后边管的办法，因地制宜地加强幼苗管理。丰润等六个县还对部分出苗不全的麦田及时补种。邯郸地区通过查出苗补缺苗，查墒情补浇水，查肥料补追肥，查地面工程补作畦的“四查四补”，有效地推动了田间管理工作。磁县、大名两县对部分底肥不足的麦田，采取串沟施肥的办法，全部补足了底肥。低洼盐碱地麦田较多的天津地区在基本完成种麦计划以后，各县针对今年旱麦多、洼碱地麦多和间作套种多等特点，分别开展了轧耙早茬麦、中耕洼碱地麦以及为套种麦田补肥的田间管理运动。交河县发动群众总结碱地保苗经验，采取早浇水、中耕、追肥等措施，加强了田间管理。
    在田间管理中，各地还特别注意防治地下虫害。已发生虫害的地区，普遍采用毒饵、毒谷进行除治。天津地区本着无虫要防，有虫抢治的精神，对已经发生或将要发生虫害的麦田普治了一遍。
    据新华社郑州22日电　河南省各地人民公社本着“一手抓进度、一手抓质量”的精神，在早茬小麦基本种完以后，迅速转入了突击抢种中、晚茬麦的战斗，同时展开了以查苗补苗为中心的麦田管理运动。力争中茬赶早茬，晚茬不晚、早茬亩亩块块苗全苗齐苗壮。
    到18日统计，全省播种的小麦已占麦播计划面积的56％。目前，各地在胜利结束早茬麦播种以后，又调集劳力，采用边施肥、边深翻、边平整、边打畦、边浸种拌种、边播种的办法，突击抢种中、晚茬麦。
    为了充分发挥劳力、畜力、工具在种麦中的潜力，各地普遍采用巧使、巧用、巧安排的办法，大大提高了工效和质量。为了使种麦进度平衡发展，各地社与社队与队之间还开展了比进度比质量的竞赛。
    各地在抢种、种好中、晚茬麦的同时，还积极开展了早茬麦的查苗补苗活动。新乡、开封、南阳、许昌等专区先后开展了群众性的麦播大检查、大评比、边检查、边补课运动。商丘县还以生产大队为单位，组织干部和社员代表深入田间，对早茬麦逐方逐块进行了检查。宋集公社周庄大队通过检查，对一部分缺苗断垅的麦田，进行了补种或重种。民权县龙虎寺公社龙虎寺大队针对碱地小麦不易提苗的特点，对已播种的二千四百多亩碱地麦，采取治虫、压碱、补种等三个措施、组织二百多名劳力及时加强了管理。并且对缺苗地块进行了接垅补种。
