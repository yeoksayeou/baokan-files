Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi – Following the basic realization of agricultural collectivization in North Vietnam, efforts are now concentrated on consolidation and improvement.

To meet the needs of the rapid development of agricultural cooperatives, the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party recently held a meeting of representatives from various provinces to exchange experiences on the training and improvement of leading cadres in agricultural cooperatives, and to formulate relevant work plans. The meeting decided that from now until the beginning of 1961, 500,000 leading cadres, including directors, deputy directors, production team leaders, and group leaders of agricultural cooperatives throughout the North, will be trained. Furthermore, a "Four Goods" (good unity, good production, good management, good policy implementation) competition will be launched to bring the expanded and newly established cooperatives quickly onto the right track, and to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest in late-season and winter-spring crops. In accordance with the spirit of this meeting, Hung Yen Province has opened many study classes, absorbing more than 1,100 cadres to learn cooperative management experience. Through these studies, more than 280 weaker cooperatives in the province have been strengthened and adjusted in their leadership, and have been consolidated organizationally. The leading organs of Shanxi Province are both conducting a general inspection of the management work of agricultural cooperatives through representatives of counties and townships, and organizing the dissemination of advanced cooperative management experiences. At present, many agricultural cooperatives, after initial consolidation, have reformed their management work and are formulating production increase plans, setting off a labor emulation campaign. Bac Ninh, Thai Binh, Hai Duong, Nam Dinh and other provinces are carrying out consolidation by starting with the inspection and promotion of current production, discovering and solving existing problems while producing, and closely combining production with the work of consolidating cooperatives.

Simultaneous with the internal consolidation of agricultural cooperatives, relevant leading departments and enterprises such as factories and mines are taking various measures to vigorously support the production of agricultural cooperatives. At present, state-owned trading companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have separately drawn up plans for the supply of agricultural tools, draught cattle, fertilizers, and daily necessities, preparing for timely supply. The commercial departments are also preparing to expand the procurement contracts signed with agricultural cooperatives, opening up sales channels for agricultural and sideline products, in order to promote the development of rural sideline production.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia – Bulgaria's autumn harvest is being intensified. So far, the sunflower harvest has been completed, the corn harvest has basically been completed, and the harvest of cotton, sugar beets, etc. is continuing.

According to materials from the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the average yield per unit area of autumn harvest crops in agricultural cooperatives nationwide has increased compared to last year. For example, approximately 220 kilograms of corn and 140 kilograms of sunflowers were harvested per decare (equivalent to 1.5 mu), approximately 10 kilograms and 23 kilograms more than last year, respectively. It is expected that the average yield of sugar beets and seed cotton in cooperatives will reach 2,500 kilograms per decare (340 kilograms more than last year) and 63 kilograms, respectively.

While harvesting in the autumn, members of agricultural cooperatives throughout the country are also actively engaged in autumn planting and making silage. It is estimated that the total area to be sown with wheat, barley, rye and rapeseed this autumn will be approximately 17 million decares, of which wheat will be approximately 13.5 million decares, approximately 500,000 decares larger than last year. As of October 18, approximately 11 million decares of autumn crops nationwide had been sown, which is 64.6% of the planned area, approximately 2 million decares more than the same period last year.

The work of making silage is also progressing quite rapidly. As of October 11, agricultural cooperatives nationwide had made more than 6 million tons of silage, which is 81.1% of the plan, approximately 700,000 tons more than the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana – According to the Albanian Telegraph Agency, Albania has recently begun autumn afforestation. During this season, 1,000 hectares of land will be afforested, and 10,000 hectares of logged forest land will be renewed.

Forests are one of Albania's great resources, and forest area accounts for almost half of the country's area.

Since the establishment of the people's government, Albania has taken many important measures to protect and develop forests. In the past sixteen years, a total of 18,000 hectares have been afforested nationwide, and more than 60,000 hectares of forest land have been renewed.

During the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), Albania will afforest more than 20,000 hectares; by 1975, the afforested area will reach at least 60,000 hectares. During this period, more than 40,000 hectares of logged forest land will also be renewed; by 1975, the total renewed forest land will reach 120,000 hectares. (Picture attached)

    保加紧秋收秋种　阿开始秋季造林
    新华社河内讯　越南北方各地在基本实现农业合作化后，目前正集中力量进行巩固提高。
    为适应农业合作社大量发展的需要，越南劳动党中央农村工作部最近召开各省代表会议，就培养和提高农业合作社领导干部问题交流经验，制订出有关工作计划。会议决定从现在起到1961年初，全北方将训练五十万农业合作社主任、副主任、生产队长、组长等领导干部，并且开展“四好”（团结好、生产好、管理好、执行政策好）的竞赛运动，使扩大后的农业合作社和新建的合作社迅速走上正轨，力争晚造和冬春造全面大丰收。根据这次会议的精神，兴安省开办了许多学习班，吸收一千一百多名干部，学习办社经验。经过这些学习，全省已有二百八十多个基础较弱的社，充实和调整了领导骨干，从组织上得到了巩固。山西省领导机关一面通过各县、乡代表，普遍检查农业合作社的管理工作，一面组织传播先进的办社经验。目前，很多农业合作社经过初步巩固，管理工作得到了改革，正制订增产计划，掀起劳动竞赛。北宁、太平、海阳、南定等省从检查推动当前生产入手进行巩固，边生产边发现和解决存在的问题，把生产和巩固合作社的工作紧密结合起来。
    与农业合作社内部巩固同时，各有关领导部门和工厂矿山等企业单位，正采取多种措施，大力支援农业合作社的生产。目前，各地国营贸易公司和供销合作社，分别订出供应农具、耕牛、肥料和生活资料的计划，准备及时供应。各商业部门还准备扩大同农业合作社签订的收购合同，为农副产品打开销路，以促进农村副业生产的发展。
    新华社索非亚讯　保加利亚秋收工作正在加紧进行。到目前为止，向日葵已收获完毕，玉米已经基本收完，棉花、甜菜等的收获工作仍在继续进行中。
    据保加利亚农林部的材料，全国农业合作社的秋收作物的平均单位面积产量比去年有所提高。例如，每一狄卡尔（合一市亩半）约收了二百二十公斤玉米和一百四十公斤向日葵，分别比去年多约十公斤和二十三公斤。预计，合作社的甜菜和籽棉的平均产量将分别达每一狄卡尔二千五百公斤（比去年多三百四十公斤）和六十三公斤。
    在秋收的同时，全国农业合作社的社员们还积极进行秋种和制作青贮饲料。预计，今年秋天要播种的小麦、大麦、黑麦和油菜的总面积约为一千七百万狄卡尔，其中小麦约为一千三百五十万狄卡尔，约比去年扩大五十万狄卡尔。到10月18日为止，全国约有一千一百万狄卡尔的秋种作物已经播种完毕，即完成了计划的64.6％，比去年同期多种了约二百万狄卡尔。
    制作青贮饲料的工作也进展得相当快。到10月11日为止，全国农业社制作的青贮饲料共达六百万吨以上，即完成了计划的81.1％，约比去年同期增加七十万吨。
    新华社地拉那讯　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚最近开始进行秋季造林。在这个季节里，将造林一千公顷，并更新一万公顷已采伐过的林地。
    森林是阿尔巴尼亚巨大的资源之一，森林面积几乎占全国面积的一半。
    自建立人民政权以来，阿尔巴尼亚采取了许多重要措施来保护和发展森林。十六年来，全国共造林一万八千公顷，更新了六万公顷以上的林地。
    在第三个五年计划（1961——1965年）期间，阿尔巴尼亚将造林二万多公顷；到1975年，造林面积至少将达六万公顷。在这期间，还将更新四万公顷以上已采伐过的林地；到1975年，更新的林地总共将达十二万公顷。（附图片）
