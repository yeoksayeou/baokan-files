Grasp With Both Hands
    Yudong

Autumn is truly the golden season of the year. Not to mention the crops ripening all over the fields, the various wild plants all over the mountains and plains are also constantly beckoning people to gather them; in the vast fields after the crops have been harvested, there are also various by-products and many useful things. As long as people pay attention and are diligent, they can really obtain many good things that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood at any time and anywhere. Some provinces and regions, taking advantage of this great opportunity, seize every opportunity during the busy "Three Autumns" (Autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting) to organize a group of laborers to go up the mountains and down to the rivers to vigorously grasp the "Small Autumn Harvest"; some people's communes educate their members to treat agricultural by-products as carefully as they treat grain, and to carefully collect stalks, vines and leaves, leaving no stem behind and losing no leaf. Grasping both the "Big Autumn Harvest" and the "Small Autumn Harvest"; grasping both the "main products" and the "by-products," this two-pronged approach is very good and very necessary!

Our industry has developed and needs more wild plants as raw materials. Our animal husbandry has developed and needs more agricultural by-products as feed. As various undertakings develop, the need for various materials will also increase. A large part of these materials comes from agriculture and from the countryside. To meet the needs of all parties, we must grasp with both hands and recover everything that is useful.

Some things from the "Small Autumn Harvest" may seem small and scattered, but they are indispensable for the country's industrial production and people's lives. We must not despise them because they are "small." For example, medicinal materials; you cannot prepare medicine if you are missing a single ingredient. Medicinal materials are so important, and isn't it the same for other things like wild plants?

We should also pay enough attention to the collection of agricultural by-products. Collecting by-products well will also benefit the main products. For example, collecting crop stalks well will provide more fuel and feed. Comprehensively utilizing these stalks will further increase many industrial raw materials and means of subsistence. Merely in terms of increasing feed, it can make "the six domestic animals flourish," providing more animal power and fertilizer for agricultural production and promoting the faster development of grain production.

It seems that doing a good job in the "Big Autumn Harvest" and also grasping the "Small Autumn Harvest" is a good way to provide the country with more industrial raw materials and increase the income of commune members. All areas with suitable conditions should, while doing a good job in the "Big Autumn Harvest," take advantage of the current great opportunity to organize a certain amount of manpower to grasp the "Small Autumn Harvest." For the collection of agricultural by-products, every people's commune should, like the Fengqiao Production Team of Panshui Commune in Puan County, Guizhou, conduct ideological education among its members, formulate appropriate methods, and ensure that everything is collected and nothing is lost.

The key to doing a good job in the "Small Autumn Harvest" is to rationally organize the labor force. People's communes, production brigades, and production teams must arrange farm work well, organize the labor force well. For those products that are far away and in large quantities, the commune and production brigade should organize a certain amount of labor to collect them; for products that are closer or more scattered, they can be collected at any time in conjunction with farm work. Some products can be collected collectively by the production team, and some can also be mobilized for commune members to collect individually during labor gaps. Large collectives, small collectives, and individuals should have a good division of labor and work together to enable us to obtain more harvests.

    要两手抓
    豫东
    秋天真是一年的黄金季节。且不说那遍地黄熟的庄稼，就是那满山遍野的各种野生植物，也时时在招唤着人们去采集；在收割了庄稼以后的广大田野，也还有各种副产品和有许多有用之物。人们只要留心注意，人勤手快，真是随时随地都可以搞到许多有利于国计民生的好东西。有些省、区，乘这个大好时机，在“三秋”大忙中见缝插针，组织一批劳力，上山下水，大抓“小秋收”；有的人民公社，则教育社员像珍惜粮食一样来对待农作物的副产品，要把秸秆、藤叶仔细收好，一根不留，一片不丢。既抓“大秋收”，又抓“小秋收”；既抓“主产品”，又抓“副产品”，这样两手来抓，抓得很好，非常必要！
    我们的工业发展了，需要更多的野生植物作原料。我们的畜牧业发展了，需要更多的农作物副产品作饲料。各项事业发展了，需要各种各样的物资也就更多了。这些物资很大一部分来自农业，来自农村。要满足各方面的需要，就要两手抓，把一切有用的东西都收回来。
    “小秋收”的有些东西，虽然显得有些小而零碎，但却是国家工业生产和人民生活中不可缺少的，决不可以因为它“小”就轻视它，譬如药材，缺一味也配不成药。药材如此重要，其他如野生植物，又何尝不是这样？
    对农作物副产品的收藏，也应予以足够的重视。收好了副产品，也会有利于正产品。譬如收藏好农作物的秸秆，便有了更多的燃料和饲料。把这些秸秆再加以综合利用，更会增加很多的工业原料和生活资料。仅仅以增加饲料而论，就能使得“六畜兴旺”，给农业生产提供更多的畜力和肥料，促进粮食的生产更快发展。
    这样看来，搞好“大秋收”，又抓好“小秋收”，是给国家提供更多的工业原料、增加社员收入的好办法，凡是有条件的地区，在作好“大秋收”的同时，都应乘当前大好时机，组织一定的人力，来抓“小秋收”。对于农作物副产品的收藏，则每一个人民公社都应该像贵州普安县盘水公社峰桥生产队那样，向社员进行思想教育，制订适当的办法，作到样样都收，一点不丢。
    作好“小秋收”的关键是合理组织劳动力。人民公社和生产队以及生产小队要很好地安排农活，很好地组织劳力，对那些距离较远的、大宗的产品，应该由公社和生产队组织一定劳力，进行采集；距离较近或比较零星的产品，就可以结合农活的进行，随时进行采集。有些产品，可以由生产队集体采集，有的还可以发动社员，利用劳动的空隙个人采集。大集体、小集体、个人，很好分工，一齐动手，就能使我们得到更多的收获。
