    Taking the Lead in Everything
    Gai Ermai, a worker from the construction plant of the Gucun Commune in Huguan County, Shanxi Province, has been back to the Mayao Management Area to participate in labor for more than two months. Gai Ermai has performed very well in his work and has been widely praised by the commune members.
    One morning during the autumn planting season, the commune members were delivering manure to the wheat fields. As soon as everyone arrived at the field, they noticed five new manure piles. "Who got here before us?" Just as they were discussing this, they suddenly saw a person carrying manure poles coming up the road at a flying pace. It was Gai Ermai! It turned out that the five new manure piles had been delivered by Gai Ermai, who had started work early. People said in unison, "Ermai, well done! We must learn from you."
    One evening after the autumn harvest began, the commune members were all having dinner, but Ermai was nowhere to be seen. After a while, Ermai came in excitedly, carrying a full sack on his shoulder. What kind of medicine was in the gourd? It turned out that Ermai was afraid that the newly dug sweet potatoes in the northern slope fields would be eaten by wild animals, so he brought them back on his way.  Wang Heyue

    事事带头
    山西壶关县固村公社建筑厂的工人盖二买，回到麻要管理区参加劳动已经二个多月了。盖二买在劳动中表现很好，受到了社员们的普遍称赞。
    秋种的一天早上，社员们正往麦田里送粪，大家刚到地头，发现已经有了五个新粪堆。“这是谁抢在我们前面呢？”正议论间，忽然看见后边路上飞也似的走来一个担粪的人，这就是盖二买呀！原来那五个新粪堆是盖二买提早上工送来的。人们异口同声地说：“二买，好样的，我们一定向你学习。”
    秋收开始后的一天晚上，社员们都在吃饭，单单不见二买。不一会，二买兴冲冲地走进来，肩上扛着装得满满的一条口袋。葫芦里装的什么药呀？原来是二买怕北坡地里新刨出的甘薯被野兽吃掉，所以顺路扛回来了。  王贺悦
