    Refurbishing and Repairing: Fast and Good
    39 Clothing Stores in Guiyang Improve Work Quality and Benefit the Masses

    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Guiyang, October 29th) The clothing industry in Guiyang is expanding its business of dismantling old clothes for refurbishment and repair, providing services for the masses to alter and mend autumn and winter clothing.

    In order to meet the needs of the people to alter and mend their autumn and winter clothing, the clothing industry in Guiyang has further expanded its refurbishment and repair business since the beginning of autumn, and has added service organizations. At present, there are eight specialized and thirty-one part-time refurbishment and repair stores in the city. At the same time, many repair service stations and shops have also been added in various industrial and mining areas and people's communes. The newly established cotton clothing refurbishment stores in the urban area not only repair old and worn cotton clothing for customers, but also can re-card old cotton. From July to September this year, according to statistics from thirty-nine stores in the urban area alone, they refurbished and altered more than 40,000 pieces of woolen, silk, and cotton autumn and winter clothing for the masses.

    In order to improve work quality, shorten pickup times, and improve service attitudes, the clothing industry has universally launched a red flag competition. The Fushui South Road Xiaoshizi Refurbishment and Repair Store originally needed fifteen days to refurbish cotton clothing, and seven to ten days to refurbish single-layer clothing. After launching the red flag competition, cotton clothing can be picked up in just five days.

    In order to improve the service level of personnel engaged in refurbishment and repair and to facilitate the masses, the municipal clothing department also actively helps sewing service stations in urban people's communes and industrial and mining areas solve equipment problems, and sends technicians to circulate and teach tailoring techniques. Since August this year, the Nanning District commercial department has transferred 36 outstanding workers from the clothing industry to set up sewing service points in industrial and mining areas such as Xiaohe, Ganyintang, and Youzhajie. Up to now, they have assisted stores in these areas in establishing five clothing stores with refurbishment and alteration as their main business, and have trained more than 120 workers who can tailor and use sewing machines, refurbishing and repairing a large number of winter and single-layer clothes for the workers in these areas.

    More than 10,000 repair and service workers in Tianjin have launched a "Five Goods" competition centered on improving service quality, adding many new service items and new measures to facilitate the masses. This is a new service item added to the "Repair and Service Street" on Dagu Road: oiling old wooden basins.

    翻新补旧  又快又好
    贵阳三十九个服装门市部提高工作质量便利群众
    本报贵阳29日电　贵阳市服装行业扩大拆旧翻新、缝补业务，为群众改制和缝补秋冬服装。
    为了适应人民群众改制和缝补秋冬服装的需要，贵阳市服装行业入秋以来就进一步扩大翻新补旧业务，增设服务组织，目前全市城区已有八个专营和三十一个兼营翻新补旧的门市部，同时，各工矿区、人民公社也增设了许多缝补服务站、店。市区新设的棉衣翻改门市部，不仅为顾客补好旧破棉衣，旧棉花也可以代为翻弹。今年7至9月，仅市区三十九个门市部的统计，就为群众翻改毛呢、丝绸、棉布的秋冬衣物共四万多件。
    为了提高工作质量，缩短取货时间，改进服务态度，服装行业普遍开展了红旗竞赛。富水南路小十字翻新补旧门市部，原来翻改棉衣需要十五天，翻改单衣需要七天到十天才能取件。开展红旗竞赛后，棉衣只需五天就能取件。
    市属服装部门为了提高从事翻新补旧业务人员的服务水平，方便群众，还积极帮助城市人民公社和工矿区的缝纫服务站解决设备问题，并派出技术人员，巡回传授裁剪技术。南明区商业部门从今年8月起，抽调了服装行业的优秀工人三十六名，分别下到小河、甘荫塘、油榨街等工矿区去设立缝补服务点。到目前为止，他们已协助这些地区的商店，新设了五个以翻新改旧为主要业务的服装门市部，并培养了能剪裁、能使用缝纫机的工人一百二十多名，为这些地区的职工翻改、缝补了大量冬衣、单衣。（附图片）
    天津市一万多名修配服务职工，掀起了以提高服务质量为中心的“五好”竞赛，增加了许多新服务项目和便利群众的新措施。这是大沽路“修配服务一条街”新增加的旧木盆上油的服务项目
