    Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania, Chairman of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association, Abdyl Këllezi, and other distinguished Albanian guests, today visited and toured the Jingye Machine Factory, State-owned Cotton Factory No. 2, and the Children’s Palace in Shanghai, receiving a warm welcome from workers and Young Pioneers.
    At State-owned Cotton Factory No. 2, after visiting the spinning, weaving, and dyeing workshops, Vice Chairman Këllezi and other distinguished guests met with hundreds of welcoming people in front of the statue of martyr Gu Zhenghong and delivered a speech.
    In his speech, Vice Chairman Këllezi warmly congratulated the workers of State-owned Cotton Factory No. 2, which has a glorious revolutionary tradition, for the great achievements they have made in the Great Leap Forward. He wished the factory's workers to hold even higher the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and advance victoriously. He said that these achievements were by no means easy to obtain, but were achieved through more than 20 years of armed struggle under the correct leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. He emphasized that the friendship between the people of Albania and China, based on Marxist-Leninist thought, is unbreakable. Finally, he shouted, "Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!” “Long live the friendship between China and Albania!” At this moment, the entire venue was jubilant, filled with applause and cheers.
    At the Jingye Machine Factory, Vice Chairman Këllezi and other distinguished guests watched the factory's workers using small, simple machine tools to process large machine parts. Vice Chairman Këllezi repeatedly praised the factory's workers for their soaring enthusiasm and courageous spirit of innovation in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.
    Vice Chairman Këllezi and other distinguished guests visited the Children's Palace and observed the activities of embroidery, ship model, aviation model, music, and dance groups. Vice Chairman Këllezi conveyed to the children gathered in the hall the warmest greetings from the Albanian Young Pioneers to the Young Pioneers of Shanghai and all of China. He told the children: Your happy life today was obtained by your grandfathers, fathers, and brothers under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, through resolute struggles against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. He encouraged the children to learn, learn, and learn again, as Lenin said, and congratulated the children on their good health, good work, and good studies under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The children responded to Vice Chairman Këllezi's encouragement with enthusiastic cheers.
    Some distinguished guests from the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation, as well as Chairman of the Albanian Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Misto Treska, and Secretary-General of the Albanian Writers and Artists Association, Shefki Musaraj, also visited the Shanghai Timber Factory, the Shanghai No. 8 Middle School, and the homes of advanced producers Yang Fuzhen and Xu Yongfu in the Cao Yang New Village.

    凯莱齐副主席在讲话中热情地祝贺有着光荣革命传统的国棉二厂工人在大跃进中取得的巨大成就，祝愿这个厂职工更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗乘胜前进。他说，这些成就的取得，决不是轻而易举的，是在光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，经过二十多年的武装斗争才取得的。他强调说，建立在马克思列宁主义思想基础上的阿中两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的。他最后高呼“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大团结万岁！”“中国阿尔巴尼亚友谊万岁！”这时，全场欢腾，掌声和欢呼声响成一片。
