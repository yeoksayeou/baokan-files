Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 13th: Anshan Iron and Steel's blast furnace king – No. 10 Blast Furnace, where all employees meticulously calculate and strive to use less coke to smelt more iron, maximizing the effectiveness of every kilogram of coke. From January to September this year, the average coke consumption for smelting one ton of iron in this blast furnace reached 631 kilograms, a decrease of 26 kilograms compared to last year. In particular, since August, it has been decreasing month by month and week by week. In late September, it dropped to 625 kilograms, and in early October, it further decreased to below 620 kilograms, saving a large amount of high-quality metallurgical coke for the country, becoming a bright red banner for coke conservation among Anshan Iron and Steel's blast furnaces.

	No. 10 Blast Furnace is currently China's largest modern blast furnace. At the beginning of the year, the Party Committee of the Iron Smelting Plant, based on summarizing past experiences, proposed the smelting operation policy of "Taking Wind as the Key Link," which required using less coke to smelt more iron. At that time, some people in No. 10 Blast Furnace believed that smelting more iron required using more coke. In response to this thinking, the Party Branch of No. 10 Blast Furnace, on the one hand, educated the workers on the important significance of conserving coke. After the education, most people believed that "using less coke can smelt more iron." On the other hand, they found practical measures to save coke from practice. Shi Zhongxian, the Party Branch Secretary, personally led the workers to conduct this experiment. They improved the charging method and adjusted the gas distribution, resulting in a reduction of 20 kilograms of coke consumption per ton of iron compared to the past. From then on, all employees of the furnace liberated their minds and further enhanced their confidence in conserving coke. Everyone worked together to implement the new operation policy and achieved the goal of smelting more iron with less coke. Since March this year, this blast furnace has been at the forefront of coke conservation among all the blast furnaces in the plant.

	In the process of implementing the smelting operation policy of "Taking Wind as the Key Link," the employees of No. 10 Blast Furnace, based on the characteristics of continuous production in modern blast furnaces, paid great attention to strengthening the unity of the four shifts and unifying the operations of the four shifts. All employees of the furnace worked together to integrate the four shifts into one, with shifts handing over like in a relay race and competing against each other. The shift leaders and gas workers communicated information, sought good judgment together, and promptly worked together to overcome problems. One day, after taking over the shift, furnace chief Jie Benhuai analyzed the coke consumption situation of the day's production and found that the coke ratio in the middle shift was higher than usual. He worked with the gas worker to carefully analyze each process and found that it was caused by the furnace not running smoothly and the timing of adding wind being incorrect. In addition to reversing the furnace's unfavorable conditions during his own operation, he also told each shift to stabilize the furnace conditions and gradually increase the wind. One shift followed another, attacking the key points, and quickly restored the furnace to normal, and the coke ratio was reduced to the original level. In this way, No. 10 Blast Furnace ensured that every aspect of furnace conditions, batching, wind temperature, and charging was guarded by someone from the four shifts, without missing a single point, so that the coke ratio has been decreasing week by week since September.

	Within each shift, each process operates at the same rhythm and pace, and each process closely cooperates to ensure smooth furnace conditions. The sintered ore used in this blast furnace is supplied by three units, and the composition and iron content of the sintered ore from each unit are different. In this way, each time the material is changed, if the coordination of each process is not timely, hundreds of tons of coke will be wasted. Whenever the material is changed, the raw material workers immediately and accurately notify the shift leader of the composition, grade, and particle size, and the shift leader quickly changes the coke ratio.

	The employees of No. 10 Blast Furnace are never satisfied with their existing achievements and humbly learn from the advanced experience of brother blast furnaces to supplement their own shortcomings. When they heard that No. 6 Blast Furnace had an advanced experience of "stabilizing furnace temperature," the Party Branch immediately sent shift leaders and veteran workers to learn. On the same day they returned, based on the experience of No. 6 Blast Furnace, combined with the low hot blast temperature of No. 10 Blast Furnace, they organized shift leaders, veteran workers, and technicians to debate and found the key to constantly increasing the hot blast temperature while stabilizing the furnace temperature. Next, the gas workers in charge of operating the hot blast stove launched a joint key-problem-solving competition. Xu Baoku, a skilled stove operator from Team A, took the lead and implemented the "three diligence" operation method of frequently adjusting the gas volume, frequently contacting, and frequently checking pipelines, making the hot blast temperature the highest among the four shifts. In order to help the other three shifts quickly catch up and surpass himself, Xu Baoku took the initiative to pass on his experience to everyone, realizing high wind temperatures for every shift. The hot blast temperature of the entire furnace jumped from 850 degrees to over 900 degrees, and the blast furnace coke ratio was further reduced.

	Now, all employees of the furnace have analyzed, appraised, revised, and supplemented these new operation methods and established seven systems including adjusting the load and increasing the wind temperature. Thanks to the concerted efforts of all employees, they have not only won the forefront of large blast furnaces in coke conservation, but also overfulfilled the pig iron production plan from January to September, with a quality reaching 99%. They have achieved an all-round and continuous great leap forward.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 13th: From January to September this year, the employees of No. 1 Blast Furnace of Kunming Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant used only 822 kilograms of coke on average to smelt one ton of iron. Among them, in August, they used only 633 kilograms of coke on average to smelt one ton of iron, becoming a red banner for saving coke in small blast furnaces in Yunnan Province.

	No. 1 Blast Furnace of Kunming Iron and Steel Company is a small blast furnace with a volume of 71 cubic meters. Since the beginning of this year, with the commissioning of other newly built blast furnaces in the company, the demand for coke has greatly increased. The general Party branch of No. 1 Blast Furnace Workshop started to focus on the work of saving coke at the beginning of the year. The responsible cadres of the workshop's Party organization, administration, labor union, and Communist Youth League were assigned to follow shifts for labor, using pre-shift and post-shift meetings and other opportunities to educate employees on the idea that "saving coke is everyone's responsibility." On the basis of everyone establishing the concept of saving coke, the workshop cadres, together with the masses, summarized the past experience of saving coke in this blast furnace, promoted it, and achieved remarkable results.

	In terms of saving coke, this blast furnace mainly grasped the following five key points:

	First, grasp the raw material control. According to the past experience of No. 1 Blast Furnace, when the particle size of the ore is qualified and the waste rock mixed in is small, it is easy to melt after entering the furnace, and the coke consumption is relatively reduced. The workshop cadres summarized the advanced experience of the Wang Bao group. Before the ore enters the furnace, this group carefully selects it, crushes large pieces, sifts out broken powder, and picks out waste rock, so that the material is refined. The workshop leadership organized the workers of the three shifts behind the furnace to learn from the Wang Bao group and launched a performance competition between the three shifts, so that the experience of the Wang Bao group was quickly promoted behind the furnace, ensuring that large pieces, powder, and waste rock were eliminated before the raw materials entered the furnace. The workers of each shift also consciously established a responsibility system, carefully selecting the ore before leaving get off work, and not handing over the shift if the raw materials were unqualified. Another method of treating raw materials is to roast limestone. According to the test of No. 1 Blast Furnace, after roasting, the content of calcium oxide in limestone is increased from about 53% to about 70%. In this way, the amount of limestone used can be reduced, and the heat consumed during decomposition after entering the furnace is also reduced, which can save 8% to 10% of coke. After this method was successfully tested, the employees of No. 1 Blast Furnace built two earthen furnaces behind the furnace by themselves and sent all the limestone into the blast furnace after roasting.

	Second, grasp the charging control. In the past, this furnace had more empty charge phenomenon. In one of the most serious shifts, there were up to six hours of empty charge. Every time there was an empty charge, coke had to be added continuously, resulting in a large waste of coke. According to the investigation of the workshop cadres, under the same conditions, every time there is an empty charge, 1,200 kilograms of coke are consumed to smelt one ton of iron, while only more than 600 kilograms are needed without an empty charge. Wu Jiming, the person in charge of the workshop's general Party branch, discovered the reason for the empty charge phenomenon during follow-shift labor. The main reasons were the unreasonable labor organization behind the furnace and the fact that the material car on the hoist often derailed when it reached the top of the furnace. After finding the reason, the workshop's general Party branch mobilized the masses to prescribe the right medicine, improved the labor organization behind the furnace, and changed the uneven distribution of work in charging. And in response to the problem of the material car often derailing, the hoist driver was educated on safe production, unified the operation of the three shifts, and established a responsibility system. After solving the above three problems, the material loading per shift increased from a maximum of 64 batches in the past to a maximum of 79 batches, ensuring timely material loading. In the past few months, there has been no phenomenon of empty charge in the blast furnace due to operational problems.

	Third, increase the wind temperature and reduce empty coke. No. 1 Blast Furnace has a total of four hot blast stoves. In the past, they were cleaned every three or four weeks. Due to infrequent cleaning, the holes in the checker bricks of the hot blast stoves were blocked by ash. In addition, all the hot blast stove workers were young apprentices who entered the factory after 1958 and were not skilled in operation, often resulting in low wind temperatures and having to rely on adding regular empty coke to increase the furnace temperature, adding a batch of empty coke every few batches of material, resulting in great waste. The workshop cadres first educated the hot blast stove workers to clean the ash frequently, shortening the time from three or four weeks in the past to once a week. At the same time, they also adopted methods such as lecturing, running training classes, holding on-site meetings, and carrying out technical performance competitions to quickly improve the technical level of the hot blast stove workers, so that the hot blast stove wind temperature was increased from an average of more than 600 degrees last year to an average of 755 degrees this year, and the addition of regular empty coke was stopped. This alone saved more than 700 tons of coke this year, which can supply this blast furnace for ten days.

	Fourth, correctly grasp the blast furnace conditions, reduce and avoid accidents. The practice of this furnace proves that when the furnace is not running smoothly, especially when accidents occur, it not only affects the quantity and quality of production, but also causes serious waste of raw materials and coke. Through continuously summing up past experiences and lessons, they have found a set of methods to fight against accidents, that is, the "two diligence (diligent observation and diligent analysis), one correctness (correct handling of furnace conditions), and three combinations (the duty shift workshop director, foreman, and furnace mouth worker jointly study the furnace conditions)" operation method. After each furnace of iron is produced, the duty shift workshop director, foreman, and furnace mouth worker conduct a consultation on the furnace, and promptly deal with the furnace's operating conditions and the problems found to avoid causing accidents.

	Fifth, make full use of broken coke to improve the utilization rate of coke. In the past, coke particles below 40 mm were not used and were piled up on the material yard. After the employees established the idea of "loving coke as loving grain," they organized forces to recover it, screened out the coke particles from 15 mm to 40 mm, and added them to the furnace in batches without affecting the air permeability in the blast furnace. As a result, it did not affect the furnace, but helped the furnace to burn. Since the recovery of coke particles, this furnace can save four or five tons of coke every day. (Attached pictures)

    高举节约焦炭红旗　少用焦多炼铁
    大高炉—鞍钢十号炉每吨铁用焦631公斤
    小高炉—昆钢一号炉每吨铁用焦822公斤
    新华社鞍山13日电　鞍钢高炉王——十号高炉，全炉职工人人精打细算，少用焦多炼铁，使每一公斤焦炭都发挥了最大的作用。今年1至9月份，这座高炉平均炼一吨铁所消耗的焦炭达到六百三十一公斤；比去年降低二十六公斤。尤其8月份以来，又逐月逐旬下降，9月下旬下降到六百二十五公斤，10月初又下降到六百二十公斤以下，为国家节约了大量优质冶金焦炭，成为鞍钢高炉群中节约焦炭的一面鲜艳的红旗。
    十号高炉是我国当前最大的现代化高炉。年初，炼铁厂党委在总结过去经验的基础上，提出了“以风为纲”的冶炼操作方针，这个方针要求少用焦炭多炼铁。当时十号高炉部分人却认为多炼铁，必须多用焦炭。针对这种思想，十号高炉党支部一面对职工进行节约焦炭的重要意义的教育，经过教育，多数人认为“少用焦炭能够多炼铁”。一面从实践中找出节约焦炭的切实措施，党支部书记石忠献亲自率领工人进行这一试验。他们改进了布料方法，调整了瓦斯分布，结果使每炼一吨铁耗用焦炭比过去降低二十公斤。全炉职工从此解放了思想，进一步提高了对节约焦炭的信心，大家齐心协力贯彻新的操作方针，实现了多炼铁、少用焦炭的要求。今年3月以来，这座高炉在节约焦炭方面一直跑在全厂高炉最前边。
    十号高炉职工在贯彻“以风为纲”的冶炼操作方针过程中，根据现代化高炉连续生产的特点，非常注意加强四班团结，统一四班操作。全炉职工齐心协力地把四个班结成一体，上班与下班展开了接力赛和对手赛，四班工长之间、瓦斯工之间，互通情报，共谋善断，发现问题及时协力攻克。有一天，炉长解本怀接班之后，对一天生产中焦炭耗用情况进行了分析，发现中班焦比比往日高，就同瓦斯工一起一道工序一道工序地认真分析，找出了是因炉子不顺行，加风机会不对头的缘故，他除了自己在操作当中扭转炉况不顺之外，还告诉各班稳定炉况，逐渐加风，这样一个班接着一个班猛攻关键，很快就使炉况正常了，焦比又降低到原来的水平。十号高炉就这样在炉况、配料、风温、布料等各个环节上，都做到了四个班关关有人把守，一关不漏，使9月以来焦比逐旬降低。
    在每一班当中，各个工序都踩一个鼓点，迈一个步子，每一道工序都紧密配合，保证炉况顺利。这座高炉所用的烧结矿是由三个单位供应的，而各单位的烧结矿成分和含铁量都不一样，这样，每变换一次料，如果各工序配合不及时，就会浪费数百吨焦炭。原料工人每当变料时，马上把成分、品位、粒度准确地通知工长，工长就迅速改变焦比。
    十号高炉职工总是不满足既得成绩、虚心学习兄弟高炉先进经验，补充自己不足。他们听说六号高炉出现了“稳定炉温”的先进经验，党支部马上派工长、老工人前去学习，回来当天就根据六高炉的经验，结合十高炉热风温度低的情况，组织工长、老工人、技术人员争鸣，找出了在稳定炉温的同时，应当不断提高热风温度的操作关键。接着，负责操纵热风炉的各班瓦斯工展开了联合攻关赛。甲班烧炉能手徐宝库一马当先，他实行了勤调正瓦斯量、勤联系、勤检查管道的“三勤”操作法，使热风温度在四班当中拔尖。徐宝库为了让其它三班很快赶上和超过自己，主动把经验传授给大家，实现了班班高风温，全炉热风温度由八百五十度一跃达到九百度以上，从此高炉焦比有了进一步降低。
    现在，全炉职工已把这些新的操作方法，经过分析、鉴定、修改、补充，建立了调正负荷、提高风温等七项制度。由于全炉职工齐心努力，不仅在节约焦炭上争占了大型高炉的最前锋，而且1月到9月超额完成了生铁生产计划，质量达到99％。实现了全面持续大跃进。
    新华社昆明13日电　昆明钢铁公司炼铁厂一号高炉职工今年1至9月，平均每炼一吨铁只用八百二十二公斤焦炭，其中8月份平均炼一吨铁仅用焦炭六百三十三公斤，成为云南省小高炉节约用焦的一面红旗。
    昆明钢铁公司一号高炉是一座容积为七十一立方米的小高炉。今年以来，随着公司其它新建高炉的投入生产，对焦炭的需要量大大增加。一号高炉车间党总支从年初起就抓紧了节约焦炭的工作。车间党组织、行政、工会、共青团的负责干部分工跟班劳动，利用班前班后会等机会对职工进行“节约焦炭人人有责”的教育。在大家树立了节约焦炭观念的基础上，车间干部又同群众一道，总结了这座高炉过去节约用焦的经验，加以推行，取得了显著效果。
    这座高炉在节约焦炭方面，主要是抓住了以下五个关键：
    首先是抓住原料关。根据一号高炉过去的经验，凡是矿石的粒度合格，夹杂的废石小，入炉以后容易熔化，消耗的焦炭相对减少。车间干部总结了王保小组的先进经验。这个组在矿石入炉以前，认真地加以精选，大块的破碎，碎粉末进行筛分，遇到废石就拣出来，因此做到了精料。车间领导方面组织炉后三个班的工人向王保小组学习，并开展三班之间的表演赛，使王保小组的经验迅速在炉后推广，保证原料在入炉前消灭了大块、粉末和废石。各班工人还自觉地建立了责任制度，把矿石精选好才下班，原料不合格不交班，处理原料的另一办法是焙烧石灰石。根据一号高炉试验，石灰石经过焙烧以后，含氧化钙的成份由53％左右提高到了70％左右。这样，石灰石的用量可以减少，入炉以后，分解时消耗的热量也减少，可以节约焦炭8％至10％。这个办法试验成功以后，一号高炉职工自己动手，在炉后建起了两个土炉子，把石灰石全部焙烧以后再送入高炉。
    第二，抓紧上料关。过去，这座炉子空料现象比较多，最严重的一个班空料达六小时，每空一次料，要连续加空焦，造成焦炭的大量浪费。据车间干部调查，在同样条件下，空料的时候每炼一吨铁要消耗一千二百公斤焦炭，而不空料只需要六百多公斤。车间党总支负责人武继明在跟班劳动中发现了发生空料现象的原因，主要是炉后劳动组织不合理和卷扬机上的料车到炉顶时经常跳槽。找出原因以后，车间党总支发动群众对症下药，改进了炉后的劳动组织，改变了上料忙闲不均的现象。并且针对料车经常跳槽的问题，对卷扬机司机进行了安全生产的教育，统一三班操作，建立了责任制。解决以上三个问题以后，每班上料由过去最高六十四批增加到最高七十九批，保证了上料及时。几个月来，没有发生过因操作问题而使高炉空料的现象。
    第三，提高风温，减少空焦。一号高炉共有四座热风炉，过去每隔三、四个星期才清一次灰。由于清灰不勤，热风炉格子砖的孔被灰堵塞，加以热风炉工人全部是1958年以后进厂的青年学徒工，操作不熟练，常常造成风温不高，只得靠加定期空焦来提高炉温，上几批料就加一批空焦，浪费很大。车间干部首先教育热风炉工人勤清灰，由过去三、四个星期缩短到每个星期清一次灰，同时又采取讲课、办训练班、开现场会、开展技术表演赛等办法，迅速提高了热风炉工人的技术水平，使热风炉风温由去年平均六百多度提高到今年平均七百五十五度，停止了加定期空焦，仅此一项，今年就节约了七百多吨焦炭，可供这座高炉用十天。
    第四，正确掌握高炉炉况，减少和避免事故。这座炉子的实践证明，凡是炉子运行不顺，特别是发生了事故，不但影响产量质量，而且造成原料和焦炭的严重浪费。他们通过不断总结以往的经验教训，找到了一套同事故作斗争的办法，即“两勤（勤观察、勤分析）、一正确（正确处理炉况）、三结合（值班车间主任、工长和炉口工共同研究炉况）”的操作方法，每出完一炉铁，值班车间主任、工长和炉口工就对炉子进行一次会诊，针对炉子运行情况和发现的毛病，及时加以处理，避免造成事故。
    第五，充分利用碎焦，提高焦炭的利用率。过去，四十毫米以下的焦丁都不用，堆积在料场上。在职工们树立了“爱焦如爱粮”的思想以后，组织力量加以回收，把十五毫米到四十毫米的焦丁筛出来，在不影响高炉内透气性的原则下，分批加入炉内，结果对炉子并没有影响，反而有助于炉子的燃烧。自从回收焦丁以后，这座炉子每天可节约四、五吨焦炭。（附图片）
