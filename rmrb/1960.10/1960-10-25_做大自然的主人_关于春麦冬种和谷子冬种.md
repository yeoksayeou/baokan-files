    Be the Master of Nature
    ——On Winter Planting of Spring Wheat and Millet
    Every spring sowing season is characterized by heavy tasks, short timeframes, and intense pressure. Is it possible to move a portion of the spring wheat planting to the previous winter? Winter wheat can overwinter in the fields, but can spring wheat do the same? Three years of experience have proven that it is possible! This is indeed an innovation in the cropping system!
    Once people grasp the laws of nature and the growth patterns of crops, they truly have "freedom" in production. How did this reform of winter planting of spring wheat come about? It originated from the excessive concentration of farm work during each spring sowing season. There are many types of autumn-sown crops, which can be sown successively over a relatively long period. However, spring-sown crops are simpler, mainly wheat. The wheat sowing period cannot exceed half a month at most. The spring wheat planting area has increased many times over, but the labor and animal power cannot increase in proportion to the expansion of the planting area. How to solve this contradiction? Cadres and members of Pingluo and other counties in Ningxia have been thinking about this. If spring wheat encounters spring cold before it emerges, it will root first and then sprout. If spring wheat is sown in the previous winter, can it also root first and not sprout, and then sprout when it warms up in the spring of the following year? If it can, wouldn't it be possible to move a portion of the spring wheat to the previous winter for sowing? Wouldn't it be more relaxed during spring plowing in the following year? Things are not just like this, winter planting of spring wheat can also increase production. According to the experience of Pingluo, Zhongning and other counties over the past three years, winter-planted spring wheat generally yields 8% to 15% more than spring-sown wheat. Members of the Shikong Commune in Zhongning have compared the grain weight: generally, 15,312 grains of ordinary spring wheat weigh one jin; while only 10,712 grains of winter-planted spring wheat weigh one jin. Every 100 jin of winter-planted spring wheat can produce five to eight more jin of flour than ordinary wheat. Why is this? Because it is planted early, the root system is numerous, long, and deeply rooted, absorbs more nutrients, and has more effective tillers, which ensures large ears, full grains, and high yields. According to the observation of the Guandi Brigade of the Shikong Commune, when winter-planted spring wheat sprouts in the following spring, the seeds have already taken root more than one inch deep, sprouting ten to fifteen days earlier than ordinary wheat. After overwintering, the wheat's resistance to diseases, pests, and disasters is also stronger. Winter planting of spring wheat can both alleviate the excessive tension of farm work during spring sowing and increase grain production per unit area, achieving two goals at once. It is indeed a good thing.
    Moving spring wheat to be sown in the previous winter may not seem like a big deal, but when you do the math on increasing grain production, it is a big deal. To develop agriculture and grain production in a big way, we must do these calculations carefully. The people's commune system has opened up broad avenues for agricultural technological innovation and revolution. Anything that is conducive to increasing production, should be changed and can be changed, we must be determined to change it. When everyone understands the great significance of engaging in technological reform in a big way, and everyone comes to be promoters of new things, things will be easy to handle. (Excerpt from the editorial of *Ningxia Daily*)
    The success of winter sowing of spring wheat has set a vivid example for people to further transform nature and conquer nature. It once again gives us an inspiration: We should also have a revolutionary attitude towards nature, we should not be subject to the control of nature, but should take the initiative to attack nature; we should not wait for nature's gifts, but should actively demand from nature, we must be the masters of nature, not the slaves of nature. As long as we hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we can recognize the laws of objective development, give full play to subjective initiative, and achieve great victories not only in the socialist revolution, but also in socialist construction and in the struggle with nature, and demand more material wealth from nature.
    To attack nature, to demand from nature, and to be the master of nature, we especially need revolutionary ambition, and we also especially need the spirit of scientific analysis, and the Marxist scientific attitude and work style. When winter sowing of spring wheat was just beginning to be tested in 1957, some superstitious and conservative people doubted its possibility of success. They looked at geographical environment and natural conditions with a conventional vision. They believed that the habits of the predecessors can only be followed, not changed, and natural conditions can only be listened to, not controlled. They dare not "break the old," and of course they cannot "establish the new."
    But the majority of people firmly believe that people can not only understand nature, but also conquer nature and transform nature. They have revolutionary courage and daring, and despise nature strategically. At the same time, they fully estimate the complexity and development and changes of natural conditions, and realize that people cannot fully understand and firmly grasp the laws of its development all at once. Therefore, tactically, they attach importance to nature and take practical and cautious measures to solve the specific problems in the process of conquering nature one by one. The process of Guide County's success in winter sowing of spring wheat is like this. They had revolutionary ambitions and were determined to open up a new way to increase grain production. At the same time, they did not have subjective illusions, but adopted a practical and meticulous attitude, first conducting experiments in different plots and at different times on 2.7 acres of land in Wajia Farm. As a result, one mu of Biyu wheat was sown at the right time and with effective measures, and the yield per mu was 797 jin, which was successful. On the basis of the successful experiment, it began to be promoted; in the process of promotion, they also fully realized that winter sowing of spring wheat is still a new thing after all, and systematic experience is lacking in all aspects, and the laws of its growth and development have not been thoroughly grasped. Therefore, while introducing the experience of winter sowing of spring wheat in Wajia Farm, the secretaries of the party committees at all levels took the lead, and the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation and other organizations and grassroots cadres successively engaged in command fields and experimental fields. Agricultural science research institutes and experimental stations in various communes also established experimental fields, experimenting, summarizing, and guiding at the same time. After another year of serious and down-to-earth exploration and research, they further summarized a relatively complete set of technical measures for winter sowing of spring wheat suitable for Guide area. It is precisely because they insisted on and carried forward the Marxist work style advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong of combining ambition with hard work, that they finally found a new way to develop agricultural production at high speed and increase grain production in large quantities through winter sowing of spring wheat.
                                (Excerpt from the editorial of *Qinghai Daily*)
    Since the Great Leap Forward, thanks to the emancipation of the minds of the peasant masses and their daring to think and act, and thanks to the extensive scientific research work carried out from top to bottom in various places, winter sowing of millet has developed from small-scale experiments in the winter of 1957 to the current promotion on a larger area. This is a new achievement achieved under the illumination of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune in the struggle to transform nature, and it is a major innovation in the cropping system. This innovation in the cropping system has produced significant production increase effects. According to the results of experiments in Jindongnan, Jinzhong and other places in recent years, under the same farming conditions and on the same land, winter sowing of millet generally yields 10% to 20% more than spring sowing. What is especially important is that winter sowing of millet can not only achieve the practical effect of increasing production, but also effectively regulate the tense situation of labor and animal power in spring. For many years, there has been such a contradiction in agricultural production: spring and autumn are busy, summer is less busy, and winter is relatively idle. In the busy spring season, the lack of labor often affects intensive farming to a certain extent, making it impossible to effectively increase yields. After the implementation of winter sowing of spring millet, a part of the farm work in spring can be done in advance in winter. Due to winter sowing of millet, in the second year, the time for sowing, thinning, management, and harvesting can be staggered from other crops, regulating labor and animal power, thereby relatively overcoming the phenomenon of labor shortage and rough farming. Not only that, after doing this, it can also avoid the phenomenon of supply exceeding demand for production materials such as fertilizers and medicines during the spring sowing season.
    Winter sowing of millet is a new work, and like other new things, it will always be doubted and even criticized at the beginning. Some people think that millet is sown in spring and harvested in autumn. This is an experience passed down from ancient times. Even if winter sowing of millet increases production, it is accidental. People who hold this view do not understand such a scientific truth: after one to three months of low-temperature exercise, the millet seeds with weak vitality are eliminated, and the seeds that can germinate and emerge are full and vigorous. In addition, the seedlings emerge early, the growing period is long, the light is more, the accumulated temperature is more, and naturally the roots are more, the stems are thick, the ears are large, the grains are full, and the yield is large. The fact that the first team of Shangjiao Management Area of Lucheng Commune in Lingchuan County has achieved bumper harvests of winter millet for three consecutive years since 1958 (winter millet has been planted in 40,000 mu in Lingchuan County this year) has fully proved that winter sowing of millet conforms to its growth law. Perhaps some people think that winter sowing of millet can be promoted in areas with hot climates, but it will not work in areas with cold climates. The Luoshuihe People's Commune in Lingqiu County, which is located outside the Great Wall, and the Jiajiamao Commune in Baode, which is located on the Loess Plateau in northwestern Shanxi, should be said to be relatively cold areas, but the 143 mu of winter millet sown this year in Luoshuihe Commune achieved an average yield of 148 jin per mu, which is 23.3% higher than the yield of spring-sown millet with the same soil quality and the same farming conditions.
    Of course, winter sowing of millet can increase production more than spring sowing, which only means that this condition is available in terms of natural law. Whether it can really increase production and how much it can increase still depends on whether the measures from sowing to management can keep up, and whether the agricultural eight-character constitution is implemented well.
                                  (Excerpt from the editorial of *Shanxi Daily*)
    Winter-sown millet is a product of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, and it is also the result of giving full play to the superiority of the people's commune. In the high tide of communization after the autumn of 1958, some rural cadres and farmers, in order to seek ways to increase millet production, tried winter-sown millet and generally achieved success, creating a good start for winter-sown millet. Last year, the party committee of Goumenzi Commune in Lingyuan County, Liaoning Province, created a high-yield record of 1,061.8 jin per mu on average for 1.6 mu of winter-sown millet. The Chaoyang Municipal Party Committee and the Lingyuan County Party Committee immediately promoted it in an all-round way, making winter-sown millet blossom everywhere. Over the past two years, the masses have seen the benefits of winter-sown millet, and winter-sown millet will have greater development this year. This process shows that with the changes in the relations of production, not only has the reform of the cropping system been promoted, but also the strong strength of the commune has guaranteed the promotion of various new experiences.
    Winter sowing of millet is a revolutionary measure to change the low yield of millet. Winter sowing can reduce the loss of soil moisture in spring, and with the soil moisture during the anti-slurry period, seedlings can emerge early and fully before and after Qingming. According to a survey by Beilu Commune in Lingyuan County, the average number of plants per hectare of winter-sown millet increased by 50.7% compared with spring-sown millet; however, the rate of missing seedlings was the opposite. The rate of missing seedlings in spring-sown millet was on average three times higher than that of winter-sown millet. The ability of winter-sown millet to overcome spring drought has been recognized by more and more people. Winter-sown millet also has the characteristics of early emergence, long growing period, developed roots, strong absorption, strong stress resistance, and increased number of plants. Therefore, winter-sown millet generally has high yields, good rice quality, and increases both grain and grass. Therefore, under the new situation of "developing agriculture in a big way and developing grain in a big way," it is of great significance to promote the experience of winter-sown millet and change the low yield of millet.
    Due to the change in the production cycle of winter-sown millet, the three major seasons of planting, management, and harvesting are all carried out in advance and are staggered with spring-sown crops, so that the balanced use of labor and animal power can be achieved. Lingyuan County has calculated an account based on practical experience: this year, it is planned to winter-sow 10,000 hectares of millet, and only the sowing operation in the coming spring can reduce 100,000 man-days and 50,000 animal-days, allowing the county to complete the spring sowing task half a month in advance. In this sense, winter-sown millet is also a strategic measure to solve the shortage of labor and animal power and promote the all-round development of agriculture.

### 做大自然的主人——关于春麦冬种和谷子冬种

    做大自然的主人
    ——关于春麦冬种和谷子冬种
    每到春播，任务重，时间短，十分紧张。能不能把一部分春麦，移到头年冬天种呢？冬麦可以在田里越冬，春麦能不能越冬呢？三年来的经验证明，是可以的。这确是耕作制度上的一个革新！
    人们一旦掌握了自然规律，掌握了作物生长规律，在生产上就真正有了“自由”。春麦冬种这个改革是怎样引起的呢？是从每年春播时农活过分集中引起的。秋播作物种类多，可以在一个较长的时间陆续播种；春播作物却比较单纯，主要是小麦。小麦播种期先后顶多不能超过半个月。春麦播种面积成倍地扩大，但是劳力畜力却不能随着播种面积的扩大而成倍地增加，这个矛盾怎样解决呢？宁夏平罗等县的干部和社员们就在这上面动了脑筋。春播小麦在没出土以前，如果遇上春寒，是先扎根后出苗；如果把春麦提前在头年冬天播种，是不是也可以先扎根、不出苗，到来年春暖再出苗呢？如果能够，不就可以把一部分春麦挪在前一年冬天播种吗？来年春耕时不是就可以松宽一些吗？事情还不仅仅如此，春麦冬种还可以增产。根据平罗、中宁等县三年来的经验，冬种的春麦一般比春播小麦增产8％到15％。中宁石空公社的社员们曾经称粒对比过，一般春麦一万五千三百一十二粒才够一斤；冬种的春麦一万零七百一十二粒就够一斤；每百斤冬种的春麦比一般麦子能多出五到八斤面。这是为什么呢？因为种得早，根系又多又长，扎得又深，吸收养分多，有效分蘖也多，保证了穗大粒饱产量高。根据石空公社关帝大队的观察，冬种的春麦来年春天出苗时，种子已经扎根一寸多深，比一般小麦早出苗十天到十五天。经过越冬锻炼，小麦的抗病抗虫抗灾能力也强。春麦冬种，一能缓和春播时农活过分紧张，二能多打粮食提高单位面积产量，一举双得，的确是件好事。
    春小麦挪在头一年冬天播种，看来不是什么了不起的事，但是从增产粮食上一算细账，就是个大事。我们大办农业、大办粮食，就要在这些地方算细账。人民公社制度，为农业技术革新和技术革命开辟了广阔的道路；凡是有利于增产，应该改而又能够改的，我们都要下决心去改。人人都明白了大闹技术改革的重大意义，都来当新生事物的促进派，事情就好办了。　（摘自《宁夏日报》社论）
    春麦冬播的成功，为人们进一步改造自然、征服自然树立了一个生动的榜样。它又一次给我们启示：对待自然，同样应该有革命的态度，不能听凭自然的支配，而应该主动地向自然进攻；不能等待自然的恩赐，而应该积极地向自然索取，要作自然的主人，不能作自然的奴隶。只要高举毛泽东思想红旗，我们就可以认识客观发展的规律，充分发挥主观能动性，不仅在社会主义革命中，而且在社会主义建设中、在和大自然的斗争中取得伟大的胜利，向大自然索取到更多的物质财富。
    向自然进攻，向自然索取，作自然的主人，特别需要革命的雄心壮志，也特别需要科学的分析精神，需要马克思主义的科学态度和工作作风。在1957年刚刚开始进行春麦冬播试种的时候，有些迷信保守的人怀疑它成功的可能性，他们用墨守成规的眼光去看待地理环境和自然条件，他们认为前人的习惯是只能奉行、不能改变的，自然条件是只能听其支配、不能驾驭的。他们不敢“破旧”，当然也不能“立新”。
    而大多数人却坚信人不仅能够认识自然，而且能够战胜自然，改造自然，他们具有革命的胆量和勇气，在战略上藐视自然，同时，他们又充分估计到自然条件的复杂，发展变化，认识到人们不能一下子就全部洞悉和巩固地掌握它发展的规律，因而，在战术上又重视自然，采取踏实谨慎的措施，一个一个地解决征服自然过程中的具体问题。贵德县春麦冬播获得成功的过程就是这样的。他们抱着革命的雄心壮志，坚定地要打开一条增产粮食的新途径，但同时，又不是主观地空想，而是采取踏实细致的态度，首先在瓦家农场二亩七分地里分片分期地进行试验，结果，有一块一亩地的碧玉麦因播种适时，措施得力，亩产七百九十七斤，获得了成功。在试验成功的基础上，开始推广；在推广过程中，他们也充分认识到春麦冬播毕竟还是一个新生的事物，各方面还缺乏系统的经验，它生长发育的规律还没有彻底的掌握，因而，在介绍瓦家农场春麦冬播经验的同时，各级党委书记挂帅，共青团、妇联等组织和基层干部纷纷搞指挥田、试验田，农业科学研究所、各公社试验站也都建立了试验田，边试验、边总结、边指导，经过又一年的认真踏实的探索与研究，他们又进一步总结出了一套比较完整的、适合贵德地区的春麦冬播的技术措施。正是因为他们坚持并发扬了毛泽东同志一贯倡导的把雄心壮志和踏实苦干结合起来的这种马克思主义作风，终于找到了春麦冬播这条高速度发展农业生产、大量增产粮食的新途径。
                                （摘自《青海日报》社论）
    大跃进以来，由于农民群众思想解放，敢想敢干，由于各地自上而下广泛地进行了科学研究工作，谷子冬播已经由1957年冬的小型试验发展为现在较大面积的推广。这是在总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三面红旗照耀下，在改造自然的斗争中所取得的一项新成就，是耕作制度上的一项大革新。这项耕作制度的革新，已经产生了显著的增产效果。据晋东南、晋中等地几年来试验结果证明，在同等耕作条件同样土地内，谷子冬播一般比春播增产10％至20％。尤其重要的是，谷子冬播不仅可以取得增产实效，而且可以有效地调节春季劳畜力的紧张状况。多少年以来，在农业生产上存在着这样一个矛盾：春秋大忙，夏季小忙，冬季比较空闲。在春季大忙季节，常常因为劳力不够支配，在一定程度上影响精耕细作，使产量不能有效地提高。实行春谷冬播之后，就可以把春季的一部分农活，提前在冬季做了，由于谷子冬播，到第二年，就可以在播种、间苗、管理、收获等主要环节上，和其他作物错开时间，调节劳畜力，从而相对地克服劳力紧张和耕作粗糙的现象。不仅如此，这样作了之后，还能避免春播时期肥料、药剂等生产资料的供不应求现象。
    谷子冬播是一件新的工作，和其它新生事物一样，开始总会被人们怀疑，甚至责难。有人认为，谷子春种秋收，这是自古以来流传下来的经验，冬天种谷子，纵然增产了也是偶然的。抱有这种观点的人，是因为他们不了解这样一个科学道理：谷子冬播，种籽经过一至三个月的低温锻炼，生活力弱的种籽都被淘汰，能发芽出苗的都是籽粒饱满生活力强的种籽。加之出苗早，生长期长，所受到的光照多，积温多，自然也就长的根多、茎粗、穗大、籽粒饱满、产量大。陵川县潞城公社上郊管区第一队从1958年以来，连续三年获得冬谷丰收的事实（陵川县全县今年已种植到四万亩）已经完全证明了谷子冬播是符合它的生长规律的。也许有人认为，谷子冬播在气候热的地区可以推行，气候寒冷的地区行不通。地处塞外的灵丘县落水河人民公社和晋西北高原保德贾家峁公社，应该说是比较寒冷的地区吧，可是，落水河公社今年试种的一百四十三亩冬谷，平均亩产达到一百四十八斤，和同等土质同等耕作条件的春播谷子比较，产量提高23.3％。
    当然，谷子冬播比春播能够增产，这只是说在自然规律上具备了这种条件。能否真正增产和增产多少，仍然要看从播种到管理的措施能不能赶上去，要看农业八字宪法贯彻执行的好坏而定。
                                  （摘自《山西日报》社论）
    冬播谷子是农业生产大跃进的产物，也是充分发挥人民公社优越性的结果。在1958年秋后公社化高潮中，有些农村干部和农民，为了寻求谷子增产途径，试种了冬播谷子，普遍获得成功，为冬播谷子创造了良好的开端。去年辽宁凌源县沟门子公社党委试种的一亩六分地冬播谷子，创造了平均亩产一千零六十一点八斤的高产纪录后，中共朝阳市委和凌源县委立即全面推广，使冬播谷子遍地开花。两年来群众都看到了冬播谷子的好处，今年冬播谷子将有更大的发展。这个过程说明了，随着生产关系的变革，不仅促进了耕作制度的改革，由于公社的雄厚力量，也给推广各项新经验，提供了保证。
    冬播谷子是改变谷子低产状况的一项革命措施。冬播可以使春季土壤水分散失的少，借着反浆期的墒情，清明前后就能早出苗、出全苗。据凌源县北炉公社调查，冬播谷子平均每垧株数比春播谷子增加50.7％；缺苗率却相反，春播谷子缺苗率平均比冬播谷子高出三倍。冬播谷子可以战胜春旱，已为越来越多的群众所认识。冬播谷子还具有出苗早、生育期长、根部发达、吸收力强、抗逆力大、增多株数等特点，所以冬播谷子普遍产量高、米质好、增粮又增草。因此，在“大办农业，大办粮食”的新形势之下，推行冬播谷子经验，改变谷子低产状况，具有十分重要的意义。
    冬播谷子由于生产周期的改变，种、管、收三大季节，节节提前，都和春播作物交错进行，就可以做到劳力、畜力的均衡使用。凌源县根据实际经验算了一笔账：今年计划冬播谷子一万垧，明春仅播种一项作业就可以减少十万个人工、五万个畜工，可使全县提前半月完成春播任务。在这个意义上说，冬播谷子又是解决劳力、畜力不足，促进农业全面发展的一项具有战略性的措施。
