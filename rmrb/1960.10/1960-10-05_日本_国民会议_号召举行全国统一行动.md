    Japan's "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty" issued a letter of appeal on the 4th to joint struggle organizations throughout the country, based on a decision made at its Executive Committee meeting on the 1st, calling on the people of the whole country to launch the 23rd National Unified Action on the 22nd of this month. The letter of appeal stipulates that the central slogans of the 23rd National Unified Action are: "Oppose the New Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, Smash the Japan-U.S. Military Alliance," "Dismiss reactionary judges, oppose illegal suppression," and "Remove politicians who implement the Security Treaty and strive for victory in the general election."
    The National Council's Tactical Committee has decided to hold a large-scale central assembly and demonstration in Tokyo on the unified action day—the 22nd.
