    Xinhua News Agency report: The Hushan Brigade of Xiabu Commune in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, has adopted a method combining leadership and the masses to continue promoting the management system of "Three Guarantees to the Team, Measures to the Field, Rewards for Over-Production, Compensation for Under-Production," greatly promoting winter planting preparation work.
    The winter planting area implemented by the Hushan Brigade this year increased by 47.3% compared to last year. This is mainly due to the full mobilization of the masses during the formulation of the "Three Guarantees." The Party branch first extensively and deeply carried out a propaganda and education campaign of "Vigorously Develop Agriculture, Vigorously Develop Grain," adopting methods of "Calculating" (calculating grain needs), "Summarizing" (summarizing last year's winter planting experiences and achievements), "Finding" (finding winter planting approaches and yield-increasing measures), and "Debating" (clarifying thinking), further enhancing the confidence and determination of the vast number of cadres and masses to complete the winter planting tasks. Then, taking the production team as a unit, specific discussions were held to tap the land potential. The broad masses offered advice and suggestions, adopting methods of changing winter-flooded fields to winter-plowed fields, reclaiming wasteland, promoting intercropping of trees and grains, planting broad beans on the edges of green manure fields, planting radishes beside field ridges, planting cabbage beside ditches, planting greens on slopes, and intercropping and multiple cropping to expand the planting area. For the original paddy fields, dry land, and large tracts of land convenient for collective operation, the brigade uniformly managed them and implemented a "Three Guarantees and One Reward" responsibility system. Small plots of land and winter-idle land that were inconvenient for the brigade to manage were distributed to production teams (public canteens) to grow vegetables and fodder, with the income belonging to the production team (canteen). Individual commune members were allowed to plant vegetables and miscellaneous grains on scattered land in front of and behind houses for their own consumption.
    On the basis of making a good winter planting plan, the commune members were mobilized to repeatedly discuss and rationally formulate the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" management system to promote the implementation of the plan and ensure that winter crops are planted well.
    Due to the mobilization of the masses to formulate the winter planting "Three Guarantees" plan, the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the commune members have been greatly improved. Everyone contributed ideas and suggestions, solving the difficulty of insufficient winter planting seeds. If there were insufficient green manure seeds, grass seed husks (with uncleaned grass seeds) would be mixed and sown. To meet the fertilizer needs of winter crops, 20% of the labor force has been arranged to carry out the autumn manure accumulation campaign. Land preparation and sowing work are also actively underway. A "Three Exceeding" (sowing exceeding plans, quality exceeding standards, total output exceeding quotas) red flag competition movement between teams and groups is developing vigorously.

    三包落实到队　加快冬种准备
    虎山大队掀起“播种超计划、质量超规格、总产超包产”竞赛
    本报讯　江西省萍乡县下埠公社虎山大队采取领导与群众相结合的方法，继续推行“三包到队、措施到田、超产奖励、减产赔偿”的管理制度，大大促进了冬种准备工作。
    虎山大队今年冬种落实的面积比去年增加了47.3％，这主要是在制定“三包”的过程中，充分发动了群众。党支部首先广泛深入地开展了“大办农业、大办粮食”的宣传教育运动，采取“算”（算粮食需要账）“总”（总结去年冬种经验和成就）“找”（找冬种门路和增产措施）“辩”（辩通思想）的方法，使广大干部和群众进一步增强了完成冬种任务的信心与决心。然后，又以生产小队为单位，具体讨论，挖掘土地潜力。广大群众献计献策，采取把浸冬田改为冬拆田，开垦荒土，推行林粮混种，在绿肥田里推行田墈脚岸种蚕豆，田墈旁边种萝卜，水沟旁边种白菜，土坡上面种青菜，和间种套种办法扩大了种植面积。对原有水田、旱土和便于集体经营的大块土地，由大队统一经营，实行“三包一奖”责任制度；对大队不便经营的小块土地和冬闲土地，分给生产队（公共食堂），种蔬菜和饲料，收入归生产队（食堂）所有；屋前屋后的零星土地允许社员种植蔬菜和杂粮，自种自收。
    在作好冬种规划的基础上，发动社员反复讨论，合理制定了“三包一奖”管理制度，以促进规划落实，保证冬种作物多种种好。
    由于发动群众制定了冬种“三包”计划，社员的积极性和责任感大大提高了。人人献计献策，解决了冬种种子不足的困难。绿肥种子不足，便利用草种壳（有未除净的草子种）混合播种；为了满足冬种作物肥料的需要，已安排了20％的劳动力，开展秋季积肥运动；整地和播种工作也在积极进行。一个队与队、组与组的“三超”（播种超计划，质量超规格，总产超包产）红旗竞赛运动，正蓬勃开展起来。（附图片）
