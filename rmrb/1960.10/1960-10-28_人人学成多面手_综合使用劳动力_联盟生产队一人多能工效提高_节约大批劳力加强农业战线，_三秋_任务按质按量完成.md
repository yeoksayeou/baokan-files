Xi'an, October 27th (Our Newspaper) – Since late August, the Alliance Production Team of the Yongle People's Commune in Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province, has launched a mass movement for everyone to be versatile, comprehensively using, and maximizing the conservation of labor.

Since the Party Central Committee issued instructions to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, the Alliance Production Team's Party branch immediately concentrated more than 80% of its labor force on the agricultural front line. To ensure that everyone could fully play their role in production and maximize labor savings, the whole team launched a movement for everyone to be versatile and comprehensively use labor. The main methods are:

(1) Non-agricultural production professionals use their spare time to do farm work. For example, cooks use their free time after meals to shell corn, pick cotton, and feed pigs. Previously, feeders were only responsible for feeding livestock and not for chopping grass, cleaning pens, or hauling soil. Now, feeders seize the time in the morning and afternoon to carry water, push soil, and prepare for feeding livestock, freeing up their morning time to contract for cleaning manure, weeding, and hauling soil. Childcare workers and educators in nurseries and kindergartens also do farm work within their capabilities.

(2) Jobs with roughly the same nature are combined as rationally as possible. The production team's accountant also manages document and statistics work; the cashier also manages the credit cooperative's accounting work. This has freed up more than 20 laborers to work in the fields. They also merged the pig farm, flour mill, and noodle mill; and merged the youth farm, fertilizer factory, and vegetable garden. This allows for unified use of labor and simultaneous attention to various farm tasks. The 29 workers in the team-run farm tool repair shops, sewing factories, brick and tile factories, fertilizer factories, oil presses, and other industrial and sideline units participate in production based on the principle of farming during busy agricultural seasons and working during slack seasons. The commercial personnel of the team's supply and marketing cooperative grasp the patterns of members buying and selling goods, usually operating the business early in the morning and late in the evening, and spending most of the remaining time working in the fields.

The members of the Alliance Production Team gradually realized in practice that in carrying out activities for everyone to be versatile and comprehensively using labor, they should adapt to people, tasks, and time. For example, cooks, feeders, and others, because they have shorter spare time each day, should combine with farm work that is close by and not time-sensitive; childcare workers and educators, and others, because they are mostly female and weak laborers, are suitable for combining with light work and farm work with low mobility; personnel in sewing factories should do more farm work during the slack sewing season and less farm work during the busy sewing season, and so on.

Practice has proved that everyone being versatile and comprehensively using labor has many benefits: First, it reduces idle labor and waste, and improves labor efficiency. After the youth farm, fertilizer factory, and vegetable garden were merged, due to the comprehensive use of labor, the average work efficiency of each member per day under the same quota standard increased from the original eight points to twelve points. After the team's accountant also managed document and statistics work, half of the people were drawn to field production. Within a month and a half, all 112 cooks in the team spent part of the afternoon doing farm work, totaling 1,260 workdays. Second, compared to single production, people's labor intensity is more balanced. Third, it is easier to take care of whichever farm work is urgent, and the labor force focuses on key tasks, catching up with the agricultural season. The total number of workdays required for various crops in this production team is usually about 20% different compared to the actual number of workdays invested in farmland. During the "Sanxia" and "Sanqiu" busy agricultural seasons, the activities of making everyone versatile and comprehensively using labor ensured that the management of late autumn and vegetables, the picking of cotton, and the sowing of wheat, and other production tasks, were completed on time with quality. Fourth, many members have become versatile, knowing both farming and work.

In the activities of making everyone versatile and comprehensively using labor, the Party branch of the Alliance Production Team launched a red banner bearer movement, inspiring the members' enthusiasm for labor. In order to strengthen quota management, each small team timely assessed and recorded work points for the farm work done by cooks, feeders, and childcare workers, and summarized and announced it to the members on a monthly basis; at the same time, attention was paid to implementing the system of combining work and rest.

    人人学成多面手　综合使用劳动力
    联盟生产队一人多能工效提高
    节约大批劳力加强农业战线，“三秋”任务按质按量完成
    本报西安27日电　陕西三原县永乐人民公社联盟生产队从8月下旬以来，开展了一个一人多能，综合使用，最大限度地节约劳动力的群众运动。
    党中央指示大办农业、大办粮食以来，联盟生产队党支部立即把80％以上的劳力集中到农业第一线。为使每一个人都能在生产中充分发挥作用，作到最大限度地节约劳力，全队开展了一人多能，综合使用劳力的运动。主要作法是：
    （一）非农田生产的专业人员利用闲时兼做农活。例如炊事员纷纷利用饭后的空闲时间，进行玉米脱粒、剥棉花、喂猪。原先，饲养员只管喂牲口，不管铡草、出圈、拉土，现在饲养员纷纷抓紧早晨、下午担水、推土，做好喂养牲口的准备工作，腾出上午时间，包做出圈粪、锄草、拉土等活路。托儿所、幼儿班的保育员、教养员，也纷纷兼做她们力能胜任的农活。
    （二）性质大体相同的业务，尽量合理兼职。生产队的会计兼管文书、统计工作；出纳员兼管信用部的会计工作。这样全队就挤出二十多名劳力下地生产。他们还把养猪场、面粉厂、粉坊合并起来；又把青年农场、化肥厂、菜园子合并。这样可以统一使用劳力，各项农活同时兼顾。队办的农具修配厂、缝纫厂、砖瓦厂、化肥厂、油坊等工业、副业单位的二十九名工人，根据农忙务农，农闲做工的原则参加生产。队供销部的商业人员，掌握社员买卖东西的规律，通常一早一晚经营商业，其余时间多半下地生产。
    联盟生产队的社员们，在实践过程中逐步摸索出，在开展一人多能，综合使用劳力的活动中，应当因人、因活、因时制宜。例如炊事员、饲养员等人，因每天空闲时间较短，宜兼做距离近的农活和时间性不强的农活；保育员、教养员等人，因多是女弱劳力，适宜兼做轻活和流动性小的农活；缝纫厂的人员，在缝纫淡季宜多做农活，在缝纫旺季宜少做农活等等。
    实践证明，一人多能，综合使用劳力有许多好处：一是减少窝工浪费，提高劳动效率。青年农场、化肥厂、菜园子合并后，由于劳力综合使用，社员们在同一定额标准下，每人每天的工效，平均由原来的八分提高到十二分。队的会计兼管文书、统计工作之后，就抽出了一半人投入田间生产。在一个半月内，全队一百一十二名炊事员，每天利用下午部分时间捎做农活，共做了一千二百六十个劳动日。二是比起单一生产来，人们的劳动强度比较均衡了。三是便于那样农活紧了顾那样，劳力赶重点，活路赶农时。这个生产队各项作物的总需工数与农田劳力实际投入的工数比较，通常相差20％左右，在三夏、三秋等农忙期间，由于开展一人多能，综合使用劳力的活动，使管理晚秋和蔬菜、摘拾棉花、播种小麦等各项生产任务，都按质量适时完成。四是许多社员学成了多面手，既会务农，又会做工。
    在开展一人多能，综合使用劳力活动中，联盟生产队的党支部开展了红旗手运动，鼓舞了社员们的劳动热情。为了加强定额管理，各小队对炊事员、饲养员、保育员等兼做的农活，都按定额及时评工记分，并按月向社员们总结公布；同时注意贯彻执行了劳逸结合制度。
