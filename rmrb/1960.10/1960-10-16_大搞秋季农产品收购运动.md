    Firmly grasp five key aspects: thorough ideological mobilization, comprehensive organizational preparation, realistic estimation of production, fair and reasonable task allocation, and arrangement and allocation of necessary labor. Resolutely achieve timely harvesting, timely distribution, timely procurement, timely arrangement of rural people's lives, and timely processing and transportation.

    The CCP Central Committee and the State Council's Instructions on Launching a Large-Scale Autumn Agricultural Product Procurement Campaign
    October 14, 1960

    I. The harvesting of autumn crops is now unfolding comprehensively. Under the guidance of the policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, all comrades in the Party and the people of the whole country should, while doing a good job in autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing, launch a large-scale agricultural product procurement campaign centered on grain, cotton, and edible oil, and further arrange and organize the people's lives.

    II. Completing the state's agricultural product procurement tasks is of great significance at present. It is related to the people's food and clothing, the arrangement of light industrial production, the supply of domestic markets and export goods, and the development of agriculture and heavy industry. This is an important aspect of ensuring the continued leap forward in China's national economy, ensuring the consolidation and development of China's urban and rural people's communes, and ensuring the implementation of the general line of socialist construction. Party committees and people's committees at all levels must do a good job in agricultural product procurement.

    III. We should make full use of the current slack farming season to vigorously develop diversified operations, launch a large-scale "small autumn harvest" campaign, and vigorously promote the processing of agricultural products and the comprehensive utilization of agricultural resources. Grain, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruit, medicine, and miscellaneous products, from production and distribution to procurement, processing, and comprehensive utilization, must be firmly grasped and comprehensively managed well. All domestic, wild, large, small, primary, secondary, plant, animal, mineral, and aquatic resources that can be utilized should be actively managed, collected and purchased in a timely manner, and processed into semi-finished and finished products in a timely manner, and comprehensive utilization should be carried out as much as possible. Doing so will greatly benefit the state, the collective, and individuals.

    IV. Launch a mass movement to transfer grain, cotton, edible oil, and other materials on a large scale. Ensure that agricultural products are transported to where they are needed in a timely manner. Long-distance and short-distance transportation should be effectively and rationally arranged, and every effort should be made to improve transportation efficiency, both to complete transportation tasks and to save labor and transportation resources.

    V. Effectively carry out all aspects of agricultural product procurement work. On the one hand, we must resolutely implement the mass line, rely on the strength of production brigades, production teams, and the broad masses to do a good job in procurement; on the other hand, we must effectively strengthen, and not weaken, agricultural product procurement agencies to adapt them to the needs of the development of the agricultural product procurement campaign.

    VI. The whole Party should take action, the whole people should take action, launch a large-scale campaign, and accomplish it in one go. It is necessary to firmly grasp five key aspects: thorough ideological mobilization, comprehensive organizational preparation, realistic estimation of production, fair and reasonable task allocation, and arrangement and allocation of necessary labor. We must resolutely achieve five timely actions: timely harvesting, timely distribution, timely procurement, timely arrangement of rural people's lives, and timely processing and transportation. Party committees and people's committees at all levels should effectively strengthen specific leadership, conscientiously solve practical problems, have both resounding calls to action and arduous and meticulous organizational work; ensure that the movement is both vigorous and down-to-earth. We must adhere to putting politics in command, launch a vigorous mass movement, fully carry out political and ideological work, start early, link each step closely, grasp it firmly to the end, and see it through from beginning to end.

    The current political and economic situation is very good, and there are many favorable conditions for doing a good job in agricultural product procurement. The campaign to increase production and practice economy, centered on grain and steel, is developing vigorously, and the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation is being further implemented. Party committees and people's committees at all levels must grasp both production and livelihood, and attach great importance to agricultural product procurement and the arrangement of people's lives. Let us hold high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, make full use of all favorable conditions, work diligently and conscientiously, and with full confidence, do our work better and victoriously complete this year's autumn agricultural product procurement tasks.

    中共中央、国务院发出指示
    大搞秋季农产品收购运动
    切实抓住五个环节：深入思想发动，各方组织准备，实事求是估计产量，公平合理分配任务，安排调配必要劳力。坚决作到及时收获，及时分配，及时收购，及时安排农村人民生活，及时加工调运
    新华社15日讯　中共中央、国务院关于大搞秋季农产品收购运动的指示　　　　　　　一九六○年十月十四日
    一、现在大秋作物的收获工作，正在全面展开。全党同志和全国人民，在大办农业、大办粮食的方针下，在搞好秋收、秋耕、秋种的同时，应当大搞以粮食、棉花、食油为中心的农产品收购运动，并且进一步安排和组织人民生活。
    二、完成国家农产品的收购任务，在目前有重大的意义，它关系到人民的吃饭穿衣，关系到轻工业生产的安排，关系到国内市场和出口物资的供应，关系到农业和重工业的发展。这是保证我国国民经济继续跃进，保证我国城乡人民公社巩固和发展，保证我国社会主义建设总路线贯彻执行的一个重要方面。各级党委和人民委员会，必须把农产品收购工作做好。
    三、应当充分利用今年农闲的时候，大力开展多种经营，大搞“小秋收”运动，大搞农产品加工和农业资源的综合利用。粮棉油麻，丝茶糖菜，烟果药杂，从生产、分配到收购、加工、综合利用，必须切实抓紧，全面搞好。一切家生的，野生的，大宗的，小宗的，主要的，次要的，植物的，动物的，矿物的，水产的，凡是能够利用的资源，都应当积极经营，及时采集起来和收购起来，及时加工为半成品和成品，并且尽可能地开展综合利用。这样作，对国家，对集体，对个人，都有很大的好处。
    四、大搞群众性的粮食、棉花、食油等物资的调运运动。保证把农产品及时调运到需要的地方。对长途运输和短途运输，要切实地合理地加以安排，千方百计地提高运输效率，既要完成运输任务，又要节约劳动力和运输力。
    五、切实作好农产品收购的各项业务工作。一方面，必须坚决贯彻群众路线，依靠生产大队、生产小队和广大群众的力量，做好收购业务工作；另一方面，要切实加强而不能削弱农产品收购业务机构，使它适应农产品收购运动发展的需要。
    六、全党动手，全民动手，大搞运动，一气呵成，要切实抓住五个环节：深入的思想发动，各方面的组织准备，实事求是地估计产量，公平合理地分配任务，安排和调配必要的劳动力。要坚决做到五个及时：及时收获，及时分配，及时收购，及时安排农村人民生活，及时加工调运。各级党委和人民委员会要切实加强具体领导，认真解决实际问题，既要有响亮的号召，又要作艰苦细致的组织工作；既要保证运动轰轰烈烈，又要保证运动踏踏实实。要坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，充分做好政治思想工作，及早动手，环环扣紧，一抓到底，善始善终。
    目前政治经济形势很好，搞好农产品收购的有利条件很多。以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动正在蓬勃开展，以农业为基础的方针正在进一步贯彻，各级党委和人民委员会要一手抓生产，一手抓生活，要十分重视农产品收购和人民生活安排。让我们高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，充分利用各方面的有利条件，兢兢业业地、满怀信心地把工作做得更好，胜利完成今年秋季农产品收购任务。
