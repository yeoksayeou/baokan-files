	Hero Factory - Gangang (Ganyintang Steel Factory)
	Guizhou Daily, Guiyang Daily Reporters
	Guiyang's Ganyintang Steel Factory is a heroic factory that started with a "monkey furnace." Its predecessor was a small sand-casting factory. In the spring of 1958, the factory's workers used a monkey furnace to smelt Guizhou Province's first batch of steel. Then, relying on a dilapidated, Qing Dynasty Gengzi era ("Boxer Protocol" era) "old master" converter, they practiced thrift and diligence in steelmaking, gradually expanding their enterprise. The factory name was changed repeatedly, finally developing into the relatively decent, new-type steel enterprise it is today. Now, its steel production task ranks second in the province.

	Adding "New Clothes" Without Forgetting "Old Clothes"
	Everything is changing so fast! Two years ago today, it was "open-air furnace, steelmaking in sheds." This time last year, it was "hand-cranked converter, people carrying steel ladles." Now, the new steelmaking workshop is equipped with new converter steelmaking equipment, and the new rolling mill workshop is roaring day and night. The area of these two new workshops is more than forty times larger than the original steelmaking workshop. Heavy-duty trucks loaded with pig iron, coke, and construction materials rush into the factory in a continuous stream, and then rush out, carrying steel and steel ingots. However, there are also "old things" alongside the tall new steelmaking workshop equipped with modern equipment. There is the old steelmaking workshop, called "semi-open-air operation," which still spews out raging steel flowers, maintaining the glorious title of a pioneer in high-quality, high-yield steelmaking in Guiyang. The cupola, which was about to collapse, was transformed by the workers using ingenious methods into a new type of pig iron melting furnace that melts quickly, has a high furnace temperature, and is the most advanced in the city. That "old master converter" left over from the Qing Dynasty Gengzi era, although long riddled with holes from burning, still spits out molten steel every day after a thorough overhaul, and each heat yields more than 300 kilograms more steel and reduces iron consumption by more than 200 kilograms. The brand-new ten-ton high-speed cranes are running in the new workshop, but the borrowed hand-pulled hoist is still hoisting ladles of molten steel, one by one.

	Difficulties are Dead, People are Alive
	Speaking of the entrepreneurial history of Gangang, the magnificent scene of the national steelmaking campaign in 1958 comes to mind. In April of that year, when Guizhou was still a blank slate in steelmaking, workers at Gangang's predecessor—the Guiyang Sand-Casting Factory—found a broken monkey furnace by the kitchen and cobbled together some wind pipes that leaked everywhere to start smelting steel. At that time, the vast majority of people in the factory had never seen steelmaking. Yang Deyan, a Buyi worker engineer who is now famous throughout the city, had just returned from Kunming Iron and Steel Plant after studying for just over a month. In that situation, in order to smelt steel sooner, no one complained, and no one took difficulties to heart. Six trial smelting attempts failed. Ma Zhaohe, the factory's Party committee secretary, said with full confidence: "People invented 606 [Salvarsan], and it failed 605 times. We've only failed six times, less than one percent. What are we afraid of? Keep working!" On the eve of that year's International Labor Day, this inconspicuous little sand-casting factory finally issued the good news, ending Guizhou's history of not producing steel. In 1959, the state required steel to be rolled into material. At that time, the quality of Gangang's steel ingots did not yet meet the requirements, and the higher authorities did not temporarily assign them a task. Unwilling to fall behind, the Gangang workers asked themselves: Is it because there is too much steel that the state has not assigned us a task? No, it is because the steel we smelt is not up to standard. In that case, why not strive to improve and smelt good steel? Difficulties are dead, people are alive, it just depends on whether people strive. So, all the factory employees worked together, worked hard, and successively broke through several key quality barriers, smelting eighty tons of steel. A batch of steel ingots was sent to Guiyang Iron and Steel Plant for trial rolling, and twenty-nine of the thirty steel ingots were of acceptable quality. In this way, Gangang again won the "qualification" to roll steel for the country. From February 1959, Gangang became one of Guiyang's main steelmaking units.

	Gangang's red flag is raised higher and higher. By the eve of the 1959 National Day, there was news that their factory was going to be renamed a steel factory (at that time, the factory was still the Central Foundry), and would now become a key factory. The workers were very excited. But a few people thought that if it was listed as a key factory, everything would be easy. So, they began to dislike the "poverty," saying that so-and-so factory had so many cranes, even if they gave us half, it would be good; individual cadres were also planning to buy sofas, build office buildings, and wanted to dress up like a big factory. The factory Party committee and the old workers discovered this trend and immediately resisted this unhealthy tendency. They said: The enterprise must be earned by our own efforts, and cannot be presented on a silver platter by others. We haven't even become a key factory yet, and we already want to put on airs. How can such people shoulder the "key" burden? They again spoke extensively to all the workers about the history of hard work during the monkey furnace steelmaking era, and called on everyone to maintain the glorious tradition. They borrowed a one-ton electric hoist, plus two I-beams, and hastily put together a crane that could lift more than two tons, which they still use today. The factory leaders still carry forward the old work style of "office work in front of the furnace." The factory's two Party committee secretaries and two factory directors shared only one old desk for a long time.

	Relying on their "family heirloom," practicing diligence and thrift, Gangang has once again won a great development in production: The factory overfulfilled its steelmaking plan for 1959 three months and seven days ahead of schedule. Without requiring state investment, the steelmaking production capacity has expanded seven times compared to the beginning of 1959.

	Becoming a "Young Master" or a Worker Class Fighter
	When conditions are bad, they are good at striving, striving to create good conditions. When conditions get better, they are also good at striving, striving to ask the state for less and contribute more to the state.

	After Gangang was officially renamed and began to expand, the first thing they encountered was the issue of racing against time and striving for quick construction and quick commissioning of production. If we waited until the equipment was complete before starting steelmaking, it is estimated that we might not be able to produce steel by now. The workers said: We can't wait, and the country can't wait. The factory Party committee said: That's right, we must strive, strive for time, strive for steel. The new factory only installed one No. 2 converter and began steelmaking, more than four months ahead of the originally planned commissioning time. In June of this year, some people saw that some factories were getting more good iron and good coke, and they were a little "envious," saying: We are also a key factory, we should get more good iron, more high-quality coke... Otherwise, the quality of steel will be difficult to improve. As soon as this thought emerged, the entire factory immediately launched a major debate, and the debate expanded from the issue of steel ingot quality to a fundamental issue: Should we rely on "key" status to eat, or should we rely on hard work? Should we become "young masters" or maintain the "poor stick" spirit and become proletarian revolutionary fighters? In the debate, old workers Yang Deyan, Xu Ziliang, and other comrades said: Those who think "I am a key factory, so I should be protected," reaching out for this and that, not hesitating to spend more of the state's money so that they can work less and want to sit in a sedan chair while others carry it, where did they put the true colors of our working class? Where did they put the Party's teachings? While debating, they worked hard, the whole factory was of one mind, fiercely attacking the high-sulfur barrier. Ma Zhaohe, the factory Party committee secretary, personally served as the slag-skimming team leader, promoting the advanced desulfurization experience of secondary slag-skimming in front of the furnace. As a result, the factory used much less good iron than in the past, but the quality of steel improved rapidly, and the qualification rate of steel ingots in July was again leading the city. From then on, the argument that "good steel cannot be smelted without good iron" had no market, and a new atmosphere of selflessness and contributing more while asking less emerged throughout the factory. In August, Li Kaifa, the workshop director of the No. 2 workshop's Red Flag Team, and the workers in the team made a bold attempt: gradually reducing the proportion of good iron, using more high-sulfur iron, and finally not using any good iron at all. As a result, the steel ingots were still 100% qualified. In order to turn the old horse into a thoroughbred, while stepping up the new factory's infrastructure, the workers also carried out the transformation of the old workshop on their own. The first was the transformation of the pig iron melting furnace. According to advanced experience from other places, there is a new type of pig iron melting furnace that can greatly increase production and has many advantages. However, the investment requires more than 30,000 yuan. So, they again carried forward the "poor stick" spirit, not using materials allocated by higher authorities, and collected old steel from the factory to splice together. Because the workshop was narrow and crane could not enter, they broke the components into smaller parts, connected them with hoists, and then assembled them. In August of this year, Guizhou's first new type of steel furnace was finally successfully transformed in Gangang's old workshop. The cost was only a quarter of the original plan, and the production capacity was almost doubled compared to the old pig iron furnace. The old factory, known as a "small pot" and "palm-sized," although still unimpressive after the transformation, has increased its production capacity by several times compared to the first half of this year.

	More and More Steel is Smelted, People Become More and More Red
	The glorious tradition of starting with a monkey furnace is taking deeper and deeper root in Gangang thanks to these old workers. In the past two years, new workers have come to Gangang in batches. Some people came with the idea that "a key steel factory must be good in every way," and were disappointed when they first arrived. In order to help new workers improve their understanding, Yang Deyan, Xu Ziliang... Many old workers patiently told the new partners about the factory's glorious history of hard work. The factory Party committee also asked Yang Deyan to give a special report to the new workers, talking about the scene of him making steel with a monkey furnace in those years, and how he listened to the Party, worked hard, and became an engineer. These deeply moved the new workers. At the end of August, when molten steel encountered wet sand during steel pouring, it splattered in all directions. Yang Laolin, a new worker who originally disliked prying up hot steel bars because they burned people, plunged into the sparks. Molten steel splashed on his sleeves, his clothes caught fire, and blisters rose on his body, but he still tightly held the molten steel ladle until all the molten steel was poured into ingots. Afterwards, he said: "If I let go, I don't know how much more steel will be scattered."

	Taking thrift as an honor and finding joy in hardship has become the noble feeling of Gangang workers and a conscious fashion throughout the factory. In Gangang, this great melting pot, more and more steel is smelted, and people become more and more red. Batch after batch of new workers are being refined into red stewards, and Gangang's "family heirloom" has more and more heirs. With these people, Gangang will surely continue to advance by leaps and bounds.

    英雄厂——甘钢
    贵州日报、贵阳日报记者
    贵阳市甘荫塘钢厂是一个靠猴子炉起家的英雄厂。它的前身是一个小小的翻砂厂，1958年春天，这个厂的职工用猴子炉炼出贵州省第一炉钢，然后，又靠着一个破破烂烂的清朝庚子年代留下来的“老爷”式转炉，勤俭炼钢，家业越发展越大，厂名也一改再改，终于发展成为今天这个比较像样的新型钢铁企业。现在，它所担负的产钢任务已居全省第二位。
    添“新装”不忘“旧衣裳”
    一切都变化得那么快！两年前的今天，这里是“露天架炉，搭棚炼钢”，去年此时是“手扳转炉，人抬钢包”。现在，新炼钢车间里安装了新的转炉炼钢设备，新的轧钢车间里日夜轰鸣。这两个新车间的面积比原来的炼钢车间大了四十多倍。装满生铁、焦炭和建筑材料的载重汽车川流不息地飞驰进厂，拉着钢材、钢锭飞驰而去。然而，这里也有“老样子”和高大的、用现代设备装备起来的新炼钢车间并列，有被称为“半露天作业”的老炼钢车间，它依旧喷吐着熊熊的钢花，保持着贵阳市炼钢优质高产急先锋的光荣称号。原来眼看就要倒塌的冲天炉，工人用穷办法改成了熔化快、炉温高、全市最先进的新型化铁炉。那个清朝庚子年代遗留下来的“老爷转炉”，虽然早已烧得百孔千疮，经过彻底改造仍旧天天吐出钢水，而且每一炉还比过去多出三百多公斤钢水，减少两百多公斤铁耗。新车间里崭新的十吨高速行车在运行，但早先那个借来的手拉葫芦，还在一包一包地吊着钢水。
    困难是死的　人是活的
    提起甘钢的创业史，1958年全民炼钢宏伟景象又浮现在眼前。那年4月，当贵州还是一个炼钢空白点的时候，甘钢的前身——贵阳翻砂厂的工人从厨房边找来了一个破猴子炉，凑合了一些四处跑风的风管，开始炼了钢。当时全厂绝大部分人都没有见过炼钢，现在闻名全市的布依族工人工程师杨德炎，那时刚从昆明钢铁厂学了一个多月回来。就在那种情况下，为了早一天炼出钢来，谁也没有叫苦，谁也没有把困难放在眼里。六次试炼都失败了。厂党委书记马朝合却信心十足地说：“人家发明六零六，失败了六百零五次。我们才六次，百分之一都不到，怕什么？再干！”就在那年国际劳动节前夕，这个不显眼的小小翻砂厂终于发出了喜报，结束了贵州不出钢的历史。1959年，国家要求钢要轧成材。甘钢当时钢锭质量还达不到要求，上级暂时没有给他们分配任务。不甘落后的甘钢工人问自己：国家没有下达任务，是钢铁太多吗？不，是因为咱们炼的钢不合格。既然这样，为什么不争口气，炼出好钢？困难是死的，人是活的，就看人争不争气。于是全厂职工一起动手，苦干实干连破几道质量上的关键，炼出了八十吨钢。送了一批钢锭到贵阳钢铁厂试轧，三十根钢锭有二十九根质量合格。就这样，甘钢又赢得了为国家轧钢的“资格”。从1959年2月份起，甘钢又成为贵阳市主要炼钢单位之一。
    甘钢的红旗越举越高。到1959年国庆节前夕，有消息说：他们厂要改为钢厂（当时这个厂还是中心铸造厂），现在就将成为一个重点厂了。工人们非常振奋。但也有少数人以为列为重点什么事都好办了。于是，他们就嫌起“寒伦”来，说某某厂那么多的行车，哪怕给我们一半也好；个别干部也盘算着买沙发，修办公楼，想打扮得像个大厂的样子。厂党委和老工人发现这个苗头立即顶住了这股歪风。他们说：家业要靠自己争得来，不能靠别人捧着送上来。还没成为重点厂，就想摆架子，这样的人怎么能挑得动“重点”担子？他们又在全体工人面前大讲特讲猴子炉炼钢时的艰苦奋斗历史，号召大家保持光荣传统。他们借来一个一吨的电动葫芦，加上两根工字钢，七手八脚地凑成一部能起重两吨多的行车，一直用到现在。厂领导依旧是发扬“炉前办公”的老作风，厂里的两位党委书记和两位厂长，四个人很长时期就只共用一张旧办公桌。
    依靠他们的“传家宝”，克勤克俭，使甘钢又赢得了生产大发展：1959年全厂炼钢计划提前三个月零七天超额完成；没有要国家的投资，炼钢生产能力却比1959年初扩大了七倍。
    当“大少爷”　还是当工人阶级战士
    条件不好的时候，他们善争，争取创造好条件；条件好起来了，他们也善争，争取少要国家一些东西，多给国家一点贡献。
    甘钢正式改名、开始扩建以后，首先碰到的就是争时间、争取快建快投入生产的问题。如果等设备齐全了，再开始炼钢，算一算，到现在也未必能出钢。工人们说：我们等不得，国家也等不及。厂党委说：对，要争，争时间，争钢铁。新厂只装好一个二号转炉，就开始炼钢，比原来计划投产时间提前了四个多月。今年6月，有些人看到有的厂得到的好铁好焦比较多，有点“眼红”，就说：咱们也是重点，应当多给些好铁，多给些上等焦……。不然，钢的质量就难搞好。这种思想一露头，全厂立即开展了一次大辩论，辩论从钢锭质量问题扩展到一个根本性的问题：是靠“重点”吃饭，还是靠干劲吃饭？是当“大少爷”，还是保持“穷棒子”精神，当无产阶级的革命战士？在辩论中，老工人杨德炎、徐子良等同志说：认为“我是重点，就该保我”，伸手要这，要那，不惜多花国家的钱，好让自己少劳累，想自己坐轿别人抬，这种思想，把咱工人阶级本色忘到哪里去了？把党的教导忘到哪里去了？他们一面辩，一面干，全厂上下一条心，猛攻高硫关。厂党委书记马朝合亲自担任扒渣组长，推广炉前二次扒渣的先进脱硫经验。结果，全厂用的好铁比过去少得多，可是钢的质量却迅速提高，7月份钢锭的合格率又在全市领先。从此，“离了好铁不能炼好钢”的论调没有市场了，全厂出现了克己厚人、少伸手、多贡献的新风气。8月份，二车间红旗班、丙班工长李开发和班里工人作了一个大胆的尝试：逐渐减少好铁比例，多用高硫铁，最后直至不用一点好铁，结果钢锭还是百分之百合格。为了变老马为千里马，在加紧新厂基建的同时，工人们又自己动手，展开了对老车间的改造工作。首先是改造化铁炉。根据外地先进经验，有一种新型的化铁炉，产量可以大提高，优点很多。但是投资要三万多元。于是，他们又发扬了“穷棒子”精神，不用上级拨材料，搜集厂里的旧钢材拼接。车间窄开不进吊车，就把部件化整为零，用葫芦接上去，然后再拼装起来。今年8月，贵州省第一座新型的化钢炉终于在甘钢老车间改造成功，成本只有原计划的四分之一，生产能力比老化铁炉翻了将近一番。被人称为“点点大的砂锅”、“巴掌大”的老厂，经过改造，虽然还是貌不惊人，可是生产能力又比今年上半年提高了好几成。
    钢越炼越多　人越炼越红
    猴子炉起家的光荣传统，依靠这些老工人，在甘钢根子越扎越深。两年来，新工人一批又一批地来到甘钢。有些人是抱着“重点钢厂，样样都好”的想法来的，初来时感到失望。为了帮助新工人提高认识，杨德炎、徐子良……许多老工人都耐心地把厂里艰苦奋斗的光荣历史讲给新伙伴听。厂党委还让杨德炎专门给新工人做了报告，讲他当年用猴子炉炼钢的情景，讲他怎样听党的话、刻苦钻研，成了工程师。这些，使新工人深受感动。8月底，浇钢时钢水遇见湿砂子，噼里啪啦地往四面爆。原来嫌撬碎热钢巴烤人的新工人杨老林，却一个劲地往火花里钻，钢水溅在他的衣袖上，衣服着了火，身上烫起了泡，可是他还是紧紧掌住钢水包，直到钢水全部浇成锭。事后他说：“我一松手，不知又要抛撒多少钢。”
    以俭为荣，以苦为乐，成了甘钢工人崇高的感情，成了全厂自觉的风尚。甘钢这座大熔炉，钢越炼越多，人越炼越红。一批一批新工人被炼成红色管家，甘钢的“传家宝”有了越来越多的继承人。凭着这些人，甘钢一定会一日千里继续猛进。
