Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th: The vast rural areas of North Vietnam, which have basically achieved collectivization, are currently formulating production plans and adopting measures to increase production, combining this with the work of consolidating cooperatives, and starting winter-spring production activities early, in order to prepare for striving for a bumper agricultural harvest next year.

The planting area of winter-spring crops in the northern provinces will generally be expanded compared to last year, and the total output and yield per unit area will also be greatly increased. Vinh Phuc Province has decided to expand the planting area of early rice by 3.9% and increase the yield per unit area by 4.2%. Thai Binh Province plans to achieve a total output of 219,000 tons of rice in the province during the winter-spring season, a twofold increase compared to this year's early rice. Son Tay Province has decided to reclaim 2,000 hectares of wasteland during this winter and spring to expand the planting area of Nan Ninh rice.

In order to ensure the realization of the winter-spring production plan, various provinces have also adopted a series of production increase measures such as vigorously developing water conservancy, vigorously promoting manure accumulation, reforming agricultural implements, and improving cultivation techniques. Currently, on the expansion construction site of the Bac Hung Hai irrigation system, more than 40,000 laborers are fighting every day. After the completion of this expansion project, the irrigation area will be expanded from 57,000 hectares last year to more than 88,000 hectares. The people of Bac Ninh Province are building a large number of medium and small-sized water conservancy projects to ensure that 24,000 hectares of farmland are irrigated. Ha Dong Province has decided to complete 10 million to 12 million cubic meters of water conservancy earthwork from October this year to May next year.

The manure accumulation movement has been enthusiastically launched in various places. This year, the provinces have continued to carry out the "Accumulate a Thousand Catties of Fertilizer" movement. Ha Dong, Son Tay, Hai Duong and other provinces have already accumulated hundreds of thousands of tons of fertilizer. Hai Duong Province has decided to plant 680 hectares of green manure crops and raise 25,200 hectares of water hyacinth, doubling the amount from last year. The members of Wei Nam Agricultural Cooperative in Nam Dinh Province, a red banner in the manure accumulation movement, have decided to apply one hundred carts of fertilizer per mu.

This year, the work of preparing draught cattle and reforming agricultural implements, as well as improving cultivation techniques, is also better than in previous years. All provinces have decided to reform 70% to 100% of old agricultural implements into new ones, with each township having at least one tractor and new-style plow. Vigorously developing rice transplanters has become a new feature in the agricultural implement reform movement. All provinces are striving to ensure that each township has at least one rice transplanter during the winter-spring production period.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 19th: Since the beginning of this year, agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Hungary have attached great importance to the development of animal husbandry and poultry farming, especially pig raising. Many cooperatives have achieved remarkable results in this regard.

Veszprém County originally planned to provide the state with 20 quintals of pork per 100 holds (each hold being equal to 8.55 mu) of land this year. Now the state has successfully completed the plan. Many cooperatives have also greatly overfulfilled their tasks.

The "Petofi Cooperative" in Somogy County originally planned to raise 907 pigs and 214 cattle this year, but it has now provided the state with 950 pigs and 314 cattle.

Animal husbandry in Szolnok County is mainly based on sheep raising. In the first half of the year, the number of sheep raised by agricultural production cooperatives in the state had increased to 50,000. In order to better develop sheep raising, a sheep raising technical school was opened in Karcag Town in this state. Various places also pay attention to raising poultry. In the past two years, the number of poultry in production cooperatives has increased by an average of nine times.

In order to meet the needs of developing animal husbandry, various places have vigorously launched the construction of livestock sheds. A large number of cooperatives have used their own funds and organized construction teams to build livestock sheds. This year, the construction cost of each livestock shed has been reduced by an average of 25% to 30% compared to last year. Livestock sheds in many places have modern equipment.

    大兴水利　大搞积肥　改革农具
    越南广大农村掀起生产热潮
    匈各地农业合作社重视发展畜牧和养禽业
    新华社河内18日电　已经基本上实现合作化的越南北方广大农村，目前正在结合巩固合作社的工作，制订生产计划，采取增产措施，及早开始冬春生产活动，为争取明年的农业大丰收作好准备。
    北方各省冬春作物的种植面积，将普遍比去年扩大，总产量和单位面积产量也将大大提高。永福省决定把早稻的种植面积扩大3.9％，单位面积产量提高4.2％。太平省计划全省冬春造稻谷总产量达到二十一万九千吨，比今年早稻增产一倍。山西省决定在今冬明春期间开垦荒地二千公顷，来扩大南宁稻的种植面积。
    为了保证实现今冬明春生产计划，各省还采取了大兴水利、大搞积肥、改革农具和改进耕作技术等一系列增产措施。目前，在北兴海灌溉系统的扩建工地上，每天都有四万以上的民工在奋战，这个扩建工程完工后，灌溉面积将从去年的五万七千公顷扩大到八万八千多公顷。北宁省人民正在兴修大批中小型水利工程，以确保两万四千公顷农田获得灌溉。河东省决定从今年10月到明年5月全省要完成一千万到一千二百万立方米的水利土方。
    积肥运动已经在各地热烈展开。各省今年继续开展了“积千斤肥”运动，河东、山西、海阳等省已经积了几十万吨肥料。海阳省决定种植绿肥作物六百八十公顷，养水浮莲二万五千二百公顷，比去年增加一倍。积肥运动中的一面红旗——南定省威南农业合作社的社员们决定每亩施肥一百车。
    今年，在准备耕牛和改革农具以及改进耕作技术等方面的工作也比往年好。各省都决定把70％到100％的旧农具改革成新式农具，每一乡最少有一架拖拉机和新式耕犁，大搞插秧机成了农具改革运动中新的特点。各省都争取在今冬明春生产期间作到每个乡至少有一部插秧机。
    新华社布达佩斯19日电　匈牙利各地农业合作社今年以来非常重视发展畜牧和养禽业，特别是养猪业。许多合作社在这方面获得了显著的成绩。
    沃什州原计划今年在每一百霍尔特（每霍尔特合八点五五市亩）土地上向国家提供二十公担猪肉。现在这个州已经胜利地完成了计划。许多合作社还大大地超额完成了任务。
    绍莫吉州“裴多菲合作社”原定今年养九百零七口猪和二百一十四头牛，但是现在已向国家提供了九百五十口猪和三百一十四头牛。
    索尔诺克州的畜牧业以养羊为主。上半年这个州的农业生产合作社所饲养的羊已增加到五万只。为了更好地发展养羊业，在这个州的卡尔查格镇开办了养羊技术学校。各地也很注意养育家禽。最近两年来，各生产合作社的家禽数目平均增长了九倍。
    为了适应发展畜牧业的需要，各地都大力展开了建筑畜舍的工作。大批合作社都自己出资金和组织建筑队来兴建畜舍。今年每座畜舍的建筑成本平均比去年降低25％到30％。很多地方的合作社畜舍都有了现代化的设备。
