Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 4th -- Cuban newspapers continue to publish numerous articles and photographs praising the tremendous achievements China has made in socialist construction.

	The Cuban Workers' Confederation's official newspaper, "Workers' Vanguard," stated, after discussing China's achievements: "The correct leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China, tempered in the class struggle against domestic reactionary forces and in the struggle against foreign imperialism, has guaranteed the decisive success of the revolution. The victory of the Chinese revolution has once again confirmed the correctness of Leninism."

	The newspaper said, "Today, China has become a happy, prosperous, and powerful nation, extending a sincere and friendly hand to the people of Asia, the Americas, and the world who love peace and are engaged in anti-colonialist struggles." The smoke screen of American slander cannot conceal the truth about the People's Republic of China, because, just as it is impossible to cover the sun with a finger, the fine qualities of this peace-loving and industrious people shine brightly before the world today. The article emphasized that Cuban-Chinese friendship is a tradition of the Cuban people.

	The weekly "New Cuba" published an article about China written by Hilda Felipe, the Secretary of Justice, who recently visited China. She emphasized that China has changed its face since the victory of the revolution eleven years ago.

	The Ministry of Education's CMKS radio station broadcast a commentary celebrating the 11th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. The commentary pointed out the good relations between China and socialist countries, Cuba, and Asian and African countries. The commentary said, "The isolation imposed by U.S. imperialism has actually been shattered."

	Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 3rd -- The Cuban newspaper "Revolución" published a commentary today stating that the currently held 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly shows that "the United States and its obsequious followers are only interested in one thing: maintaining its colonial and imperialist status."

	The newspaper condemned the United States' stubborn refusal to disarm. The newspaper also said that Eisenhower used "typical, purely hypocritical language" in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly.

	The newspaper also accused the American imperialists of "stubbornly refusing the People's Republic of China entry into the United Nations like a donkey." It said that the U.S. government's pressure to prevent China from regaining its seat in the United Nations is a mark of shame for the organization.

    古巴“工人先锋”报谈中国建设
    任何诽谤掩盖不了中国的成就
    “革命报”谴责美国殖民政策和敌视中国行为
    新华社哈瓦那4日电　古巴报纸继续发表许多文章、照片，赞扬中国在社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就。
    古巴工人联合会机关报“工人先锋”在谈到中国取得的成就以后指出：“光荣的中国共产党在进行反对国内反动势力的阶级斗争和反对外国帝国主义的斗争中锻炼出来的正确领导，保证了革命的决定性的成就。中国革命的胜利再一次证实了列宁主义的正确性。”
    这家报纸说，“今天中国已经变成了一个幸福的和繁荣富强的国家，它向亚洲、美洲和世界各国爱好和平和进行反殖民主义斗争的人民伸出了真诚和友好的手。”美国诽谤的烟幕掩盖不住中华人民共和国的真实情况，因为就好像企图用一个指头遮住太阳一样，今天这个热爱和平和勤劳的人民的优良品质光辉地在世界面前放射着光芒。文章强调说，古巴—中国的友谊是古巴人民的传统。
      “新古巴”周刊发表了最近访问过中国的司法部女秘书伊耳达·费利佩所写的关于中国的文章。她强调指出，从革命胜利十一年以来，中国已经改变了它的面貌。
    教育部的克姆斯电台发表了庆祝中华人民共和国十一周年的评论。评论指出了中国同社会主义国家、古巴、亚非国家的良好关系。评论说，“美帝国主义所强加的孤立实际上已经被粉碎了。”
    据新华社哈瓦那3日电　古巴“革命报”今天发表评论说，目前正在举行的第十五届联合国大会会议表明，“美国和它的俯首贴耳的追随者们只对一件事情感到兴趣：坚持它的殖民和帝国主义地位”。
    这家报纸指责美国坚持拒绝裁军的顽固态度。这家报纸还说，艾森豪威尔在联合国大会的发言中使用了“典型的纯粹伪善的语言”。
    这家报纸还指责美帝国主义者“像驴子一样顽固地拒绝中华人民共和国进入联合国”。它说，美国政府为阻止中国恢复它在联合国中的席位而施加的压力对这个机构来说是一个耻辱的印记。
