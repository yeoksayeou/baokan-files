    On "New"
    Worker, Xu Mingyi
    The word "new" is truly excellent! New products, new technologies, new techniques, new materials, and also new people, new things, new atmospheres, new styles, new morals... Since the Great Leap Forward, the word "new" has really been abundant! Truly, one hears "new" at all times, and sees "new" everywhere! Everyone is invigorated and cheered by "new," and is also working hard, studying diligently, and burying themselves in hard work, fighting tirelessly to achieve new accomplishments.

    The so-called "new" is continuous revolution, continuous progress, treating achieved successes as the starting point for new and greater victories, and continuously achieving new victories. Our country was originally a "poor and blank" country, which was ruined by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Through the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people, the three major enemies were defeated, and a new country was established. However, the foundation left to us by the old society was too weak, and the "poor and blank" situation has not yet been completely changed. This has aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Chinese people, making us determined to become stronger, carrying forward the "poor stick" spirit, working diligently and thriftily, greatly boosting revolutionary vigor, and building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, determined to make our country change from old to "new," from "new" to even "newer," continuously "new," and forever "new."

    The word "new" can be written with a stroke of the pen, but actually becoming "new" is not an easy thing. It must go through a process of arduous struggle and continuous revolution. Because "new" is the opposite of old, to be "new" one must reform the old, to realize new production tools, one must reform the old production tools; to adopt new production techniques, one must reform the old production techniques... And revolution must go through complex struggles. There are not many things in the world that succeed with one revolution. It is full of success and failure, progress and regression, and many other contradictions. Whether or not it will ultimately succeed depends on whether people can adopt the correct attitude to deal with these contradictions. For example, when our workshop was trial-producing a new material, it failed forty-nine times before and after. But we experimented again after failing, and broke through when we encountered difficulties. By persisting in this way, we finally broke through nine difficult barriers, made the new material, and solved the needs in production. From this, it can be seen that only by carrying out continuous revolution with the perseverance of not fearing failure, not fearing difficulties, being tenacious and unyielding, and being firm and indomitable can we continuously turn the old into "new."

    "New" is transferred according to certain times, places, and conditions. Today's so-called new things are reformed from old things. Moreover, with the development of the objective, it will also become old because it cannot meet the needs of the objective. In actual life, don't we often encounter such situations? That is: something that seems new today may become old tomorrow; it is new in this situation, but may become old in another situation. This is because time, place, and conditions have changed. If we do not see this change between new and old, and do not want to update after reforming a "new" thing, then we will stagnate, and the "new" will gradually become old. This does not conform to the proletariat's spirit of continuous revolution.

    说新
    工人　许明怡
    “新”字实在好得很！新产品、新工艺、新技术、新材料，还有新人、新事、新气象、新风格、新道德……大跃进以来，“新”字实在多得很！真是，无时不闻“新”，无处不见“新”！大家都为“新”而心情振奋，欢欣鼓舞，也在发愤图强，刻苦钻研，埋头苦干，为争取新成就而奋战不懈。
    所谓“新”就是不断革命、不断前进，把已得的成就当作新的、更大胜利的起点，不断地取得新的胜利。我们国家，原是一个“一穷二白”的国家，帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义把它弄得破烂不堪。经过我国人民的革命斗争，打垮了三大敌人，建立了新国家。但是，旧社会留给我们的底子太薄，“一穷二白”的面貌至今尚未彻底改变，这就激起了我国人民的革命热情，使我们发愤图强，发扬“穷棒子”精神，克勤克俭、大鼓革命干劲，多快好省地建设社会主义，决心使我们国家从旧到“新”，从“新”到更“新”，不断“新”，永远“新”。
    一个“新”字，用笔一挥而成，但实际“新”起来，就不是一件容易的事情了，必须经过一个艰苦奋斗、不断革命的过程。因为“新”是旧的反面，要“新”就必须革旧，要实现新的生产工具，就必须改革旧的生产工具；要采用新的生产工艺，就必须改革旧的生产工艺……。而革命是必须经过复杂的斗争的。世上一革就成功的事情是不多的。这里充满着成功与失败、前进与退缩等重重的矛盾。而终究能否成功，要看人们能否采取正确的态度来对待这些矛盾。比如，我们车间在试制一种新材料时，前后曾失败了四十九次。但失败了再试验，遇到困难就闯，这样坚持下去，终于攻破了九道难关，制成了新材料，解决了生产中的需要。由此可见，只有以不怕失败、不怕困难、顽强不屈、坚韧不拔的毅力进行不断革命，才能不断变旧为“新”。
    “新”是依一定的时间、地点、条件而转移的。今天的所谓新的东西，是由旧的东西改革而来的。而且，随着客观的发展，它也会由于满足不了客观的需要而变成旧的。在实际生活中，不是常常遇到这样的情况吗？就是：某件东西，今天看来是新的，明天也许就变成旧的了；在这种情况下是新的，在另一种情况下也许就变成为旧的了。这是因为时间、地点、条件发生了变化的缘故。如果我们看不到新与旧的这种变化，革了一项“新”的东西就不想更新，那就会停滞不前，“新”就会渐渐变旧了，这是不符合无产阶级的不断革命的精神的。
