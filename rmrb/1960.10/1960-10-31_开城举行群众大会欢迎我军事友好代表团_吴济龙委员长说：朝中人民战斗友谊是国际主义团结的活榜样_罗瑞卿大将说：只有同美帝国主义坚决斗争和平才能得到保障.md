    A mass rally was held in the station square, and Chairman Wu Jilong spoke first. Then, General Luo Ruiqing delivered a speech. (The full text of the speeches will be issued separately.) As they spoke, the welcoming masses responded with enthusiastic cheers and applause.
    Wu Jilong's Speech Respected Comrade Luo Ruiqing, Dear Comrades of the Military Friendship Delegation of the People's Republic of China:
    Today, all the people in the Kaesong area, with great joy and excitement, are here to welcome the Military Friendship Delegation of the People's Republic of China on their direct visit to our Kaesong area.
    Today, on behalf of all the party members and working people in the Kaesong area, I extend a heartfelt and warm welcome to the distinguished guests who have come to Kaesong for a friendly visit.
    During our Fatherland Liberation War against the U.S. imperialist armed aggressors, the great Chinese people dispatched the Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of their outstanding sons and daughters, to aid our revolution with their blood. The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean people, defended our country's territory from enemy aggression and established great feats of arms in fierce battles. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers launched close coordinated operations at this time, inflicting the first disastrous defeat in history on the U.S. imperialist aggressors and shattering the myth of the so-called "power" of U.S. imperialism.
    The unbreakable militant friendship displayed by the people of Korea and China during the Korean War is a living example of the proletarian internationalist friendship and solidarity of the people of socialist camp countries, and it will be forever recorded in the annals of progressive mankind. The friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples has been forged and consolidated with blood through a long and arduous struggle against foreign aggressors. The Korean and Chinese peoples became the closest revolutionary comrades-in-arms through their joint struggle against the vicious Japanese imperialist aggression in the Far East.
    Korean communists, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, and Chinese comrades launched more than fifteen years of armed struggle against Japanese imperialism shoulder to shoulder. During this period, the Korean and Chinese peoples fought bloody battles against a common enemy, and a new relationship of proletarian internationalism between the Korean and Chinese peoples began at this time.
    This visit to our country by the Military Friendship Delegation of the People's Republic of China, headed by Comrade He Long, is another clear manifestation of the unbreakable friendship and solidarity between the people of Korea and China.
    After the war, under the wise leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people rapidly restored the people's economy, which had been devastated by the war, and launched a nationwide Chollima Movement, transforming our country today into a socialist industrial-agricultural nation with a solid foundation of an independent national economy.
    Since our liberation from the colonial rule of U.S. imperialism and Syngman Rhee, the Kaesong area has undergone brilliant transformations in all areas of political, economic, and cultural life during the ten years since returning to the embrace of the Republic.
    Today, the people of Kaesong are continuing to advance bravely at the speed of Chollima in socialist construction, following the path pointed out by the Party.
    Comrades:
    Today, the people of the Kaesong area continue to wage tireless struggles for the socialist construction of the Fatherland and the promotion of peaceful reunification. At the same time, they cherish the socialist construction achievements of the great Chinese people as much as their own achievements.
    Under the wise leadership of the strong Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, holding high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, have made tremendous achievements in socialist construction, rapidly transforming the formerly backward China into a socialist great power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and advanced science and culture.
    The prosperity and growing strength of China is a tremendous contribution to strengthening the socialist camp and the world's peace-loving forces, and it greatly inspires the liberation struggles of the oppressed people and colonial peoples around the world.
    The continuous strengthening of the militant friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples and the achievements made by the people of both countries in socialist construction make a great contribution to strengthening the power of the great family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and it is also an important guarantee for maintaining and consolidating peace in the Far East and the world.
    The common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples—the U.S. imperialist aggressors—disregarding their shameful defeat in the Korean War, continue to occupy the southern half of our country, cruelly oppressing and plundering the people of southern Korea, and frantically obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea. Not only that, but they also continue to occupy Taiwan, an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and continue to carry out provocative activities against the Chinese people, perpetuating the tense situation in the Far East.
    The Korean people will hold high the banner of proletarian internationalism, and in the great family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, they will forever advance together with the fraternal Chinese people and continue to wage a resolute struggle against the common enemy—U.S. imperialism. In particular, the working people of the Kaesong area, facing the military demarcation line and confronting the U.S. imperialist aggressors, are vigilantly defending the victorious achievements of socialism.
    Just as Comrade Kim Il-sung said, no force can destroy the great friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples, nor can it overcome the strength of the unity of our two peoples.
    The militant friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples, forged in blood in the long struggle against the common enemy, is today further developed in the socialist construction of the people of both countries. The U.S. imperialists must get out of southern Korea, and the reunification of our fatherland will surely be achieved.
    The united struggle of the Chinese people will surely liberate Taiwan.
    We are confident that the common cause of the Korean and Chinese peoples in the East will surely achieve victory.
    Long live the eternal friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese peoples, forged in the struggle against the common enemy!
    Long live the unbreakable unity and solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of China, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!
    Long live the Korean Workers' Party and the Government of the Republic, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung!
    Luo Ruiqing's Speech Dear Comrade Wu Jilong, Dear Comrades and Friends:
    The Military Friendship Delegation of the People's Republic of China is greatly honored to come to Kaesong today in the course of visiting our close fraternal country, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. I and all the comrades of the delegation express our heartfelt gratitude for your warm and grand welcome! Please allow me to convey to the people of Kaesong, who stand on the forefront of defending peace in the East, the most sincere respect of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army; and to convey the deep memories and family-like greetings of all the former volunteers who participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to their Korean comrades-in-arms.
    In the years of the war against U.S. imperialist aggression, Kaesong was a city of worldwide attention. The most ferocious and aggressive U.S. imperialists of our time, after suffering a disastrous defeat in the Korean War, were forced to conduct armistice negotiations with us here. It was also here that the U.S. imperialists were finally forced to sign the armistice agreement and admit defeat in a helpless situation. In the seven years since the Korean armistice, the people of Kaesong have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, and have built this ancient capital of the Goryeo era, which was devastated by the war, into a new socialist industrial city at the speed of Chollima, becoming a socialist lighthouse standing on the northern edge of the military demarcation line, illuminating the road ahead for the people on the southern edge of the military demarcation line and in the southern half of Korea. We would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt congratulations on the greatest achievements made by the people of Kaesong!
    Our two countries, China and Korea, have always been peace-loving countries. After the people of China and Korea defeated the American aggressors shoulder to shoulder, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly put forward reasonable proposals for achieving the peaceful reunification of Korea. In order to maintain world peace and promote the peaceful reunification of Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew completely from Korea as early as two years ago. However, the troops of U.S. imperialism are still stubbornly refusing to leave South Korea, insisting on using force to create a divided situation between North and South Korea, bringing endless disasters to the Korean people. U.S. imperialism has also blatantly violated the terms stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement, illegally transporting nuclear weapons into South Korea, continuing to arm the puppet army in South Korea and stepping up war preparations, and doing everything possible to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Chinese government has consistently advocated living in peace with all peace-loving countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and has repeatedly proposed that countries in Asia and the Pacific Rim, including the United States, sign a treaty of non-aggression and peace to make this region a nuclear-free zone. The Chinese government's proposal has been warmly praised and supported by peace-loving countries and people all over the world. However, U.S. imperialism completely disregards the suggestions of our people and the people of the world, is unwilling to reach any agreement with socialist countries to ease international tensions, and continues to occupy our territory of Taiwan by force, constantly carrying out military provocations against our country. All these facts clearly prove that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of world peace and the most vicious enemy of the Chinese and Korean peoples. Only by waging a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism can peace be guaranteed.
    The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the fraternal Korean people to achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland. I firmly believe that the people of South Korea, who are suffering from hunger and cold under the iron heel of U.S. imperialism, will surely return to the warm embrace of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the just struggle of the Korean people will surely achieve complete victory, and in the great struggle against our common enemy U.S. imperialism and in defense of world peace, the people and armies of China and Korea will forever stand shoulder to shoulder and march forward!
    Long live the militant friendship between the people and armies of China and Korea, forged in blood!
    Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!
    Long live the Korean Workers' Party!
    Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live world peace!

    列车徐徐进站后，穿着鲜艳的服装的朝鲜儿童们跑来献花。罗瑞卿大将和代表团团员同前来欢迎的朝鲜劳动党开城地区委员会委员长吴济龙、人民委员会委员长金明浩、朝鲜人民军开城地区驻军首长全文燮中将等亲切地一一握手。

    在车站广场举行了群众大会，吴济龙委员长首先讲话。接着，罗瑞卿大将讲了话。（讲话全文均另发）。当他们讲话时，欢迎群众不断地报以热烈的欢呼声和掌声。
    吴济龙的讲话尊敬的罗瑞卿同志，亲爱的中华人民共和国军事友好代表团的同志们：
    今天，我们开城地区全体人民以巨大的欢欣鼓舞的心情，来迎接中华人民共和国军事友好代表团直接访问我们的开城地区。
    我今天代表开城地区的全体党员和劳动人民，衷心地、热烈地欢迎到开城地区作友好访问的贵宾们。
    伟大的中国人民在我们反对美帝国主义武装侵略者的祖国解放战争时期，派遣了以自己的优秀儿女组成的志愿军，以鲜血援助了我们的革命，中国人民志愿军官兵同朝鲜人民一道，从敌人的侵犯下保卫了我们祖国的疆土，在激烈的战斗中树立了丰功伟绩。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在这个时候展开了密切的协同作战，使美帝国主义侵略者遭到了历史上的第一次惨败，粉碎了美帝国主义的所谓“强大”的神话。
    朝中两国人民在朝鲜战争中，发挥了牢不可破的战斗友谊，是社会主义阵营国家人民的无产阶级国际主义友谊团结的活生生的榜样，它将被永远记载在进步人类的史册上。朝中两国人民的友谊是通过长期的反对外来侵略者的艰苦的斗争过程中以鲜血凝结和巩固起来的。朝中两国人民通过反对恶毒的日本帝国主义者的侵略远东的共同斗争，成了最亲密的革命战友。
    以金日成同志为首的我国共产主义者和中国同志，并肩展开了十五年以上的反对日本帝国主义的武装斗争，朝鲜人民和中国人民在这个时期反对共同的敌人，展开了浴血斗争，朝中两国人民间的无产阶级国际主义的新的关系从这个时候开始了。
    这次，以贺龙同志为团长的中华人民共和国军事友好代表团的访问我国，是朝鲜和中国两国人民间的牢不可破的友谊团结的又一个明显的表现。
    战后，朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的英明领导下，迅速地恢复了备受战争破坏的人民经济，展开了全民性的千里马运动，使我国今天变成了有着独立民族经济的巩固基础的社会主义工业—农业国家。
    我们开城地区从美帝国主义和李承晚的殖民统治下解放后，在回到共和国的怀抱的十年间，在政治、经济、文化生活的一切领域内都发生了辉煌的变革。
    今天，开城市人民都沿着党指出的道路，在社会主义建设中继续以千里马的速度奋勇前进。
    同志们：
    今天，开城地区人民为了祖国的社会主义建设和促进和平统一，继续进行不懈的斗争，同时，像自己的成就一样地无限珍视伟大的中国人民的社会主义建设成就。
    中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的强有力的中国共产党的英明领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的三面红旗，在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就，使过去落后的中国，正在迅速地转变成为有着现代工业、现代农业和先进科学文化的社会主义大强国。
    中国的繁荣和威力的壮大，是对加强社会主义阵营和世界爱好和平力量的巨大贡献，大大地鼓舞全世界被压迫人民和殖民地国家人民的解放斗争。
    朝中两国人民间的战斗友谊的不断加强和两国人民在社会主义建设中取得的成就，对加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭的威力作出巨大的贡献，同时也是维护和巩固远东和世界和平的重要的保证。
    朝中两国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义侵略者不顾它在朝鲜战争中可耻的惨败，继续强占着我们祖国的南半部，残酷地压迫和掠夺朝鲜南部的人民，疯狂地阻挠朝鲜的和平统一；不仅如此，它还继续强占着中国领土的不可分割的一部分——台湾，继续进行反对中国人民的挑衅活动，使远东紧张局势持续下去。
    朝鲜人民将更高地举起无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的大家庭中永远同兄弟般的中国人民一道前进，继续为反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争。特别是面临军事分界线同美帝国主义侵略者对峙着的开城地区劳动人民，警惕地保卫着社会主义的胜利果实。
    正如金日成同志所说的一样，任何力量也破坏不了朝中两国人民的伟大的友谊，也战胜不了我们两国人民的团结的力量。
    在反对共同敌人的长期斗争中，以鲜血凝成的朝中两国人民的战斗友谊，今天在两国人民的社会主义建设中更加发展了，美帝国主义者必须从朝鲜南部滚出去，我们祖国的统一一定能够实现。
    中国人民的团结起来的斗争必将解放台湾。
    我们确信，东方的朝中两国人民的共同事业，一定能够取得胜利。
    朝鲜人民和中国人民在反对共同的敌人的斗争中结成的永恒的友谊团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的牢不可破的统一团结万岁！
    以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府万岁！
    以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府万岁！
    罗瑞卿的讲话亲爱的吴济龙同志，亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    中华人民共和国访朝军事友好代表团，在访问我们亲密的兄弟之邦、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的过程中，今天十分荣幸地来到开城。我和代表团的全体同志，对于你们这样热烈、隆重的欢迎表示衷心的感谢！请允许我向屹立在保卫东方和平最前线的开城人民，转达中国人民和中国人民解放军最真挚的敬意；转达所有参加过抗美援朝的前志愿军官兵对朝鲜战友们的深切怀念和亲人般的问候。
    在反抗美帝国主义侵略的战争年代里，开城就是举世注目的城市。当代最凶恶的、侵略成性的美帝国主义者，在侵朝战争遭到惨败之后，就是在这里被迫同我们进行停战谈判的。也是在这里，美帝国主义者在无可奈何的情况下，终于被迫在停战协定上签字认输的。朝鲜停战以来的七年间，开城人民热烈地响应了朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅的号召，以千里马的速度把这座遭到战争摧残的高丽时代的古都建设成为新的社会主义的工业城市，成为屹立在军事分界线以北的边缘上的一座社会主义的灯塔，照亮了军事分界线南缘和朝鲜南半部人民前进的道路。我们愿趁此机会对开城人民所取得的最大成就，表示衷心的祝贺！
    我们中朝两国一向都是爱好和平的国家，中朝两国人民肩并肩地打败了美国侵略者以后，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，曾经多次地提出了实现朝鲜和平统一的合理建议。为了维护世界和平，促进朝鲜的和平统一，中国人民志愿军早在两年前就全部撤出了朝鲜。但是，美帝国主义的军队，至今仍然赖在朝鲜南部不走，坚持用武力制造南北朝鲜的分裂局面，给朝鲜人民带来无穷的灾难。美帝国主义还蛮横地破坏了朝鲜停战协定所规定的条款，非法地把核武器运进朝鲜南部，继续不断地武装朝鲜南部的傀儡军，加紧进行战争准备，百般阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。中国政府一贯主张根据和平共处五项原则同一切爱好和平的国家和睦相处，而且多次倡议亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国、包括美国在内签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约，使这个地区成为无核武器地区。中国政府的倡议，受到了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民热烈的赞扬和支持。但是，美帝国主义却完全无视我国人民和全世界人民的建议，不愿与社会主义国家取得任何缓和国际紧张局势的协议，并且仍然用武力霸占我国的领土台湾，不断地对我国进行军事挑衅。这一切事实都清楚地证明，美帝国主义是世界和平最凶恶的敌人，是中朝人民最凶恶的敌人。只有同美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，和平才能得到保障。
    中国人民坚决支持兄弟的朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一的正义斗争。我坚信，处在美帝国主义铁蹄下啼饥号寒的朝鲜南部人民，必将回到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国温暖的怀抱，朝鲜人民的正义斗争必将取得完全的胜利，在反对我们共同的敌人美帝国主义和保卫世界和平的伟大斗争中，中朝两国人民和两国的军队将永远并肩携手，阔步前进！
    中朝两国人民和两国军队之间以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊万岁！
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    朝鲜劳动党万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
