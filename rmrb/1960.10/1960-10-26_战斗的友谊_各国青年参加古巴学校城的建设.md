    The Friendship of Struggle
    ——Youth from Various Countries Participate in the Construction of Cuba’s School City
    In order to build up the sacred land of the Cuban People's Revolution—the Sierra Maestra mountains—the Cuban revolutionary government is building a Camilo Cienfuegos School City in Las Mercedes, in the mountains, which can accommodate 20,000 peasant children. Through the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the Cuban Rebel Army Youth Federation invited young people from all countries to participate in the construction of the school city to show their support for the Cuban Revolution. In August of this year, an international labor brigade composed of nearly two hundred youth representatives from more than fifty countries came to the construction site and worked alongside the Cuban people and Rebel Army soldiers for two months. China also sent a youth delegation of nine people to Cuba to participate in the construction of the school city. The delegation included national model workers in industry and agriculture, young socialist construction activists, and young students. After completing their mission, they left Cuba at the beginning of this month and returned to China.
    The construction of the Camilo Cienfuegos School City is a symbol of the militant friendship between Cuban youth and youth from all over the world. (Attached pictures)

    战斗的友谊
    ——各国青年参加古巴学校城的建设
    为了建设古巴的人民革命圣地——马埃斯特腊山区，古巴革命政府在山区的拉斯梅塞德斯地方兴建了一座可容纳两万名农民子弟入学的卡米洛·西恩富戈斯学校城。古巴起义军青年联合会通过世界民主青年联盟，邀请各国青年参加学校城的建设，以表示他们对古巴革命的支持。今年8月，一支由五十多个国家的近二百名青年代表组成的国际劳动队来到工地上，同古巴人民和起义军战士共同劳动了两个月。中国也派出了一个由九人组成的青年代表团前往古巴参加学校城建设。代表团人员包括全国工业和农业劳动模范、青年社会主义建设积极分子和青年学生。他们在完成使命后，已于本月初离古巴回国。
    卡米洛·西恩富戈斯学校城的建设，是古巴青年和世界各国青年的战斗友谊的象征。（附图片）
