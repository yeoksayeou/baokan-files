    Wuyi Steel Plant Achieves High Quality, High Output, and Low Consumption
    The entire staff of Jilin Wuyi Steel Plant extensively launched a "Thousand, Hundred, Ten Thousand" (thousand furnaces without waste steel, daily output exceeding one hundred tons, daily savings of ten thousand kilograms of pig iron) production increase and savings campaign, focusing on high quality, high output, and low consumption. Since October, daily production has exceeded 100 tons, the qualified rate of steel ingots has reached 100%, pig iron consumption per ton of steel has decreased by 2.5% compared to September, and coke consumption has decreased by 12.6% compared to September.
    
    Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant Uses Less Coal to Produce More Coke
    The coking workshop of Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant vigorously improved operating methods, recovered scraps, and used peat to make coke, making every effort to improve the utilization rate of coal, and strengthened the management of raw coal to avoid waste of coal, achieving the goal of using less coal to produce more coke. Now, the recovery rate of this workshop per ton of washed coal has increased from 50% in the past to 70%.

    Cemianhu Coal Mine Uses Indigenous Methods to Wash Coal and Produce Good Coke
    Workers at the Cemianhu Coal Mine in Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, vigorously used indigenous methods to wash coal and produce good coke. Since the beginning of this year, they have produced more than 9,000 tons of high-quality coke. The average sulfur content of coke from the entire mine is only 1.1%, the ash content is 8%, and the fixed carbon is as high as 84% or more. The coking period has also been shortened by about three days compared to the original, effectively supporting steel production.

    Hebei Achieves Remarkable Results in Conserving Coking Coal
    The iron and steel workers of Hebei Province launched a vigorous mass movement to save coking coal. While focusing on fine material work, they also paid attention to saving coal and coke outside the furnace. By reforming crushers, promoting the use of pointed hammers, straight-grained hammering, and placing stone blocks to cushion crushed coke, diligent cleaning, and diligent arrangement, the loss of coke outside the furnace was reduced by 8%. The average full coke ratio and charge coke ratio for blast furnace ironmaking in the province decreased by 15.1% and 12.3% respectively in September compared to August.

    Changchun Passenger Car Factory Reasonably Cuts Materials
    The stamping workshop of Changchun Passenger Car Factory carried out the activity of "Clever Tailor, Multiple Use of Materials," adopting methods such as nesting, improving templates, and connecting multiple jobs to save a large amount of steel.
