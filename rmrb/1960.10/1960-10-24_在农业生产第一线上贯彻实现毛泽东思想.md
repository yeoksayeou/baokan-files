Implement Mao Zedong Thought on the Front Lines of Agricultural Production
Deng Tuo

We are all working hard to strengthen the front lines of agricultural production. As many cadres and workers go to the countryside, bringing with them all of Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts on agriculture, we must ensure that this brilliant thought is fully implemented in our future long-term labor and work. This is the primary task before us.

Comrade Mao Zedong's complete thoughts on agriculture are very rich in content, and run through with a red line: taking agriculture as the foundation for the development of the national economy. Along this line of thought, we can systematically understand how Comrade Mao Zedong vividly applied Marxist-Leninist agricultural theory to China's agricultural reality in a creative way, systematically summarized China's rich agricultural experience, refined it into new theories, and thus enabled Marxist-Leninist agricultural theory to achieve new development.

From what aspects should we grasp Comrade Mao Zedong's developed Marxist-Leninist agricultural theory? I think there are the following points:

First, under the guidance of the general line of socialist construction, the development of industry and agriculture should be carried out simultaneously, with industry as the leading factor and agriculture as the foundation;

Second, the speed of agricultural development should be adapted to the speed of industrial development, and while developing heavy industry, full attention should be paid to the development of agriculture and light industry;

Third, under certain conditions, agriculture should leap from small-scale operation using animal-powered farm implements to large-scale operation using machinery;

Fourth, agriculture is the market for industry. Not only light industry needs agriculture as a market, but also heavy industry needs agriculture as an important market;

Fifth, implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is a crucial key to ensuring the rapid development of agricultural production;

Sixth, establishing and improving the people's commune system, strengthening the Party's leadership, paying attention to consolidation work, focusing on both production and livelihood, and properly arranging labor are the fundamental guarantees for the rapid development of agriculture.

The above six points, of course, cannot include all of Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts on agriculture, but these are important developments of Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist agricultural theory, and should be specially clarified to guide our future long-term practical actions on the agricultural front.

(I) Important Development of Marxist-Leninist Agricultural Theory

Why do we say that Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts on agriculture are new and important developments of Marxist-Leninist agricultural theory? As everyone knows, agriculture is the foundation for the development of the national economy. This principle is discussed in the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Comrade Mao Zedong not only concretized this theory, applied it to China, summarized China's experience, and made this theory richer, with many formulations more explicit and specific, but also put forward new arguments and new propositions, adding important new content to this theory.

Marx said in Volume III of *Das Kapital*: "Agricultural labor productivity exceeding the individual needs of the laborer is the basis of all societies, especially the basis of capitalist production." The "all societies" here, of course, include socialist and communist societies. Engels pointed out in *The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State* that agriculture was a production sector of decisive significance in ancient society (referring to slave society). Lenin also pointed out in *The Development of Capitalism in Russia* that agriculture is a decisive production sector. After the October Revolution, especially between 1920 and 1922, Lenin repeatedly said that to restore and develop the national economy, the foundation is grain production. At the Tenth All-Russian Conference of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in May 1921, Lenin emphasized: "Now, if we cannot guarantee the state receives approximately four hundred million poods of grain, there is no point in talking about large-scale industry and socialist construction." In his speech at the First Moscow Province Agricultural Congress in November of the same year, Lenin said: "The basic question posed by the entire situation today, the primary question of our republic's domestic and foreign policy, is the development of the entire economy, and primarily the development of agriculture." We should not understand these words merely as Lenin speaking about the relatively tense grain situation in Russia at that time, but should see the broader and deeper significance of these words. Stalin said in his 1928 speech *On the Grain Front* :"If industry is the brains, then agriculture is the basis of industrial development, since agriculture is the market for industrial goods, the supplier of raw materials and grain, and the source of export materials necessary for importing equipment to meet the needs of the national economy. If agriculture remains in a technologically backward state, if industry is not guaranteed an agricultural base, if agriculture is not transformed, and if agriculture does not keep up with industry, then can industry be advanced? No, it cannot." Stalin explicitly put forward here that "if industry is the brains, then agriculture is the basis of industrial development," but he did not say that agriculture is the basis of the entire national economy.

Comrade Mao Zedong has greatly developed Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin's views on agricultural issues under China's historical conditions. As people know, Comrade Mao Zedong has always attached importance to the position of agriculture in the national economy. In his 1934 paper *Our Economic Policy*, he said: "Agricultural production is the first priority in our economic construction work." In his 1945 speech *We Must Learn to Do Economic Work*, Comrade Mao Zedong also emphasized the issue of agriculture. In the same year, in his report to the Seventh National Congress of the Party, Comrade Mao Zedong further and comprehensively elaborated on the importance of agriculture in the entire national economy. In his 1950 closing address at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, he emphasized even more: "The main population of China is the peasants. The revolution succeeded with the assistance of the peasants, and the country's industrialization will also succeed with the assistance of the peasants." Later, in the prefaces and annotations to *On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation* and *The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside*, especially in the reports *On the Ten Major Relationships* and *On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People*, and in many speeches, Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly expounded the important position and role of agriculture in the national economy. Not only that, Comrade Mao Zedong also put forward a series of new theories from the fundamental problems of agriculture.

The development of the socialist national economy should take agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor; it is necessary to combine the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, and to implement the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously. This was explicitly put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong in his reports *On the Ten Major Relationships* and *On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People*. This policy later became one of the most important contents of our Party's general line for socialist construction and a whole set of policies for "walking on two legs."

Comrade Mao Zedong foresaw long ago that China's socialist construction would be at a high speed. In the prefaces and annotations to *On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation* and *The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside*, he criticized the right-leaning view held by some people that the speed of agricultural transformation and development could only be slow. This view was once considered unshakable for a considerable period. Comrade Mao Zedong completely overturned this view and put forward a new view that agricultural development can be at a high speed and can be adapted to the development of industry. In *On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People*, Comrade Mao Zedong further pointed out that while developing heavy industry, full attention should be paid to the development of agriculture and light industry. He said: "In this way, the speed of industrialization may seem slower, but in fact it will not be slow, or it may even be faster." The brilliant achievements of China's great leap forward in industry and agriculture since 1958 have powerfully proved that Comrade Mao Zedong's new Marxist-Leninist thesis on the speed of industrial and agricultural development is completely correct.

The view on the leap from small-scale agricultural production to large-scale production is obviously something that has not been said in previous Marxist-Leninist classics. As people know, agriculture in feudal society was individual small-scale production. In capitalist society, there were capitalist large farms, but capitalism does not necessarily have to completely eliminate the small-peasant economy, and even in some places, it deliberately retains the small-peasant economy to facilitate the absorption of temporary wage labor and other exploitation by capitalist large farms. Marxists advocate that after overthrowing the capitalist system, the small-peasant economy should be transformed into modern large-scale production by means of socialist transformation. This is a revolutionary step that meets the requirements of historical development and is also an inevitable trend. The question is, is the transition from small-scale agricultural production to large-scale production carried out gradually and slowly, or can it be a leap? Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in *On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation* that under the socialist system, we can completely "leap from small-scale operations using animal-powered farm implements to large-scale operations using machinery." The leap mentioned here contains two meanings: one is the leap from the use of animal-powered farm implements to the use of agricultural machinery; the other is the leap from small-scale agriculture to large-scale agriculture. These two points are related and different, and they are not necessarily the same thing. When we have a large number of agricultural machines to replace animal-powered farm implements, agricultural operations will naturally change from small-scale to large-scale. This principle is easy to understand; the question is, without agricultural machines, can agricultural operations leap from small-scale to large-scale? Some people once believed that a large number of machines must be used to equip agriculture before agricultural cooperation can be implemented. According to China's situation, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that what we should take is the road of "cooperation first, then mechanization." Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's great thought, China's agriculture has realized comprehensive cooperation and people's communes at an astonishing speed, which has opened up broad roads for the future mechanization of China's agriculture.

In the process of agriculture moving towards mechanization, industry, especially heavy industry, must supply the needs of agriculture with an increasing number of means of production. In the past, people often only paid attention to the fact that light industry should supply the countryside with an increasing number of various means of livelihood, only paying attention to the fact that the countryside is the market for light industrial products, but did not have a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between developing agriculture and developing heavy industry. Some people even thought that to develop heavy industry, it is necessary to weaken agriculture, and to develop agriculture, it is necessary to weaken heavy industry. Comrade Mao Zedong comprehensively analyzed the relationship between industry and agriculture, and especially pointed out that the countryside is also the market for heavy industry. This is a very important new thesis. In his report *On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation*, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The most important department of socialist industrialization—heavy industry, its production of tractors, its production of other agricultural machinery, its production of chemical fertilizers, its production of modern transportation tools for agricultural use, its production of kerosene and electricity for agricultural use, etc., all these are only possible on the basis of the cooperative large-scale operation of agriculture." In *On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People*, he pointed out even more clearly: "The point that heavy industry needs agriculture as an important market has not yet been made very clear to people. But with the gradual development of the technical transformation of agriculture, the increasing modernization of agriculture, machinery, fertilizers, water conservancy construction, power construction, transportation construction, civilian fuel, civilian building materials, etc. serving agriculture will increase day by day, and the situation in which heavy industry takes agriculture as an important market will be easily understood by people." In this way, the principle that agriculture is the market for heavy industry has laid a solid theoretical foundation for the policy of combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture.

In order to rapidly develop China's agricultural production, Comrade Mao Zedong also put forward the famous "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Soil, fertilizer, water, close planting, seeds, protection, management, and tools. These eight characters summarize all aspects of agricultural production and form a complete system of measures for increasing agricultural production in China. There is an inseparable dialectical relationship between the eight aspects represented by these eight characters. In the entire process of agricultural production, with the progress of the agricultural season and the different agricultural tasks, the focus also often changes. We should not only pay attention to the rich experience of China's agricultural production contained in the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, but also be good at using it to promote the solution of the relationship between the relations of production and the productive forces. We can see that some aspects of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture inevitably involve the relationship between people, the relationship between production teams and communes. As for the result of implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, the development or leap of productive forces will inevitably impact the relations of production, so that it cannot but continue to move forward to meet the requirements of the productive forces.

However, the most important weapon for systematically solving the problems of agricultural productive forces and relations of production is Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on rural people's communes. The people's commune is a great creation of the Chinese people and an important crystallization of Marxist-Leninist theory in the practice of socialist construction in China; Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on people's communes has comprehensively developed Marxism-Leninism. This theory has played a direct guiding role in agricultural practice. This theory is specifically expressed in the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's resolution on rural people's communes. On December 10, 1958, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party adopted the *Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes*, which emphasized to us: "The relations of production must be adapted to the nature of the productive forces, and only when the productive forces have developed to a certain state will a certain change in the relations of production be caused. This is a basic principle of Marxism. Comrades should remember that the level of development of our current productive forces is still very low after all. After three years of hard work, plus a few more years of effort, the economic face of the whole country can be greatly changed, but at that time, there will still be a considerable distance from the goals of national high industrialization and national agricultural mechanization and electrification; as for the goals of greatly enriching social products, greatly reducing labor intensity, and greatly shortening working hours, there will be an even longer distance." Therefore, the resolution requires that in the considerable period in the future, great efforts should be made to rectify the people's communes, establish and improve various systems, strengthen the Party's leadership, and make the new relations of production more adapted to the needs of the development of productive forces. The resolution made clear provisions on the principle issues of the three major parts of the relations of production, namely, ownership, the relationship between people in the labor process, and the distribution system. The resolution gave special attention to people, who always play a decisive role in the relationship between productive forces and relations of production. The resolution wrote: "The people's commune is the organizer of the people's production and life, and the fundamental purpose of developing production is to maximize the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of all members of society. When the Party leads the work of the commune, it must pay attention to comprehensively grasping ideology, grasping production, and grasping life. We must care for people and correct the tendency to see things but not people. The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party must care for the lives of the masses. The more the Party cares for the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be." This is always of great significance to our actual work.

(II) Let New Theories Generate Tremendous Material Force in Practice

Our current task is to strengthen the front line of agricultural production a hundredfold, and with long-term arduous efforts, strive to implement all of Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts on agriculture and transform every one of his proposals into reality. We should deeply understand Comrade Mao Zedong's important development of Marxism-Leninism on the issue of agricultural theory. We must use this new theory to guide our actual work, let this theory from practice return to practice, and combine it with the actual actions of the broad masses, so that this theory can further grasp the masses and become an incomparably huge material force. We can only improve our level of understanding of these theories, and use this as a weapon to examine our past work and summarize our existing experience, so that we can fully implement Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts on agriculture on the front line of agricultural production in the future.

Over the past two years, we have implemented the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, enabling both industry and agriculture to leap forward at an unprecedented speed. Although there is still a considerable distance between the speed of agricultural development and the speed of industrial development in our country, we will certainly be able to shorten this distance day by day and adapt the speed of agricultural development to the speed of industrial development through continuous efforts.

Some comrades believe that since we want to "develop industry and agriculture simultaneously," we should immediately make agriculture and industry have the same development speed and be equipped to the same extent. If this is not the case, it is not called "simultaneous development." This idea is unrealistic and wrong. "Simultaneous development" does not mean absolutely balanced development. As everyone knows, agricultural production has fundamentally different characteristics from industrial production. Many of the laws of growth of crops and livestock cannot be completely controlled by current human power; and natural conditions also play a dominant role in many aspects, making agricultural production difficult to stabilize. Therefore, it is impossible to make agriculture develop in balance with industry immediately. As for other comrades who one-sidedly emphasize "agriculture is the foundation" and ignore industry, commerce, and cultural and educational undertakings, this is of course also incorrect. "Agriculture is the foundation" is not equal to the theory of "agricultural fundamentalism," and it does not advocate any "agricultural fundamentalism." We attach importance to agriculture, not because we emphasize agriculture in isolation, but because we see the important role of agriculture from the perspective of the entire national economy. We attach importance to agriculture because agriculture provides grain, provides industrial raw materials (accounting for 40% of all industrial raw materials and 80% of light industrial raw materials); agriculture is an important source of national accumulation (it directly and indirectly provides financial revenue accounting for more than 50% of all financial revenue); agricultural products are important export commodities in our country (currently accounting for 73% of total exports), which can be exchanged for some of the machinery and equipment we need; and agriculture is also an important source of labor (the number of industrial workers has increased by 20 million in the past two years, most of whom came from the countryside). Leaving aside the role of agriculture in the entire national economy, emphasizing the development of agriculture in isolation does not conform to the principle that agriculture is the foundation for the development of the national economy.

In recent years, it has been completely correct for us to concentrate our main efforts on developing heavy industry, so that industry has achieved high-speed development. Our country's original industrial base was very weak. Without vigorously developing industry, we cannot fundamentally change the backward situation of "five hundred million people struggling to get enough to eat." To be precise, the rural population of 500 million has about 200 million laborers. Two hundred million people provide food for 600 million people. One person supports only three people. This is a very backward situation. In the future, we must strive to have one person support five people, or ten people, so that we can free up more than 100 million laborers to invest in industry. We attach importance to agriculture, and to adapt the speed of agricultural development to the speed of industrial development, precisely so that we can free up the strength to greatly develop industry in the future and fundamentally change our country's backward situation.

When we say that agriculture is the foundation, we mean that agriculture is the source of basic living materials, the reliance on the reproduction of labor, and the base and starting point for the development of the entire national economy. When this foundation is consolidated, other undertakings will not be shaken. The experience of the past few years shows that whenever agriculture reaps a bumper harvest in the first year, more capital construction can be "launched" in the second year, and there will be a guarantee of raw materials for industrial production. This is precisely to show the role of the "foundation." At the same time, when we say that "industry is the leading factor," it means that our entire socialist economy must continue to develop forward and build communism. Having a strong foundation is not enough. We must have a leading dragon head, which is industry. In old China, agricultural production was declining, the industrial base was weak, and the people had to eat chaff and vegetables and had to be bullied by imperialism. Liberated, the people of our country have the ambition to build a strong socialist country and to ascend to the paradise of communism. If there is only the foundation of agriculture, but no leader of industry, how can that work!

Some people ask: Is it possible to do without agriculture as the foundation when industry is greatly developed in the future? No. Agriculture will always be the foundation and will always be the fundamental reliance of the entire national economy. However, the face of agriculture is about to undergo fundamental changes. In the future, agriculture as the foundation of the national economy will be highly modernized agriculture, industrialized agriculture. In this regard, there is still a lot of work to be done in the future.

The central issue is to speed up the pace of agricultural development. In recent years, we have achieved a great leap forward in agriculture and made the ratio of agriculture to industry more reasonable. The ratio of industrial and agricultural growth was four to one during the first five-year plan period, 2.65:1 in 1958, and 2.35:1 in 1959. It can be seen that we are realizing Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction that the speed of agricultural development should be adapted to the speed of industrial development. It can be predicted that the ratio of industrial and agricultural growth will be more reasonable in the future, so that industry and agriculture can better promote each other.

We must also strive to create conditions to promote the leap of agriculture in our country from small-scale operations using animal-powered farm implements to large-scale operations using agricultural machinery. With the leap of our country's peasant individual economy to agricultural cooperatives and people's communes, the scale of agricultural operations in our country has been continuously expanded. At the beginning of liberation, there were six capitalist farms in the suburbs of Beijing, each with only two or three hundred mu of land. At that time, individual small-scale production was common. After liberation, after the cooperative movement, especially after the realization of the people's commune, the situation was completely different. Now, some people's communes in the suburbs have 8,200 mu of large tracts of cultivated land connected together. From a national perspective, after the communization, large tracts of cultivated land of several hundred mu and thousands of mu are quite common. The expansion of the operating area shows from one side that the change in the relations of production will inevitably promote the change in operating methods. Of course, we cannot ask too much in this regard, because the degree of intensive operation of agriculture in our country is not high enough at present, that is to say, the capital invested in each unit area (including equipment, fertilizer, etc.) is still relatively small, and it accounts for a smaller proportion compared with the invested live labor. Borrowing Marx's analysis of capital composition, this is a relatively low "technical composition." This is the fundamental reason why the agricultural labor productivity in our country is relatively low. Only with the progress of the technical transformation of agriculture will this situation gradually undergo fundamental changes. Our task is to promote this change.

In order to improve the technical level of agriculture and strive to realize the mechanization of agriculture when conditions are available, the means of production supplied to the countryside should be greatly increased. And these means of production are basically the products of heavy industry. From here, we can deeply understand Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on the mutual promotion of agriculture and heavy industry. Heavy industry facing the countryside, supporting the countryside, and serving the mechanization of agriculture is actually greatly developing heavy industry itself. The heavy industrial production departments of the city should shoulder the task of arming the rural areas in the suburbs with machinery. According to the situation in Beijing, the proportion of industry is very large at present. Therefore, we should have the confidence to realize the mechanization of agriculture in the suburbs of large cities like Beijing in a relatively short period of time. It should be seen that our country's socialist economic construction can never allow the contradictory phenomenon between advanced industry and backward agriculture to exist for a long time. If we do not solve this contradiction for a long time, the speed of development of our entire national economy will be seriously hindered, and the consolidation and development of our worker-peasant alliance under new conditions will also be adversely affected.

If the requirement for agricultural mechanization nationwide is "a small solution in four years, a medium solution in seven years, and a large solution in ten years," then large cities like Beijing should be faster, possibly realizing agricultural mechanization in four years. This requires all aspects of the city to strengthen assistance to the countryside. Urban factories should not only accept orders for agricultural means of production in a planned way, but also help rural people's communes run repair and assembly plants and train technicians for them. The city should also help the suburbs realize water conservancy and help the suburbs run fertilizer factories. To assist agriculture with technology and equipment is not only the responsibility of the industrial sector, but also the common responsibility of schools, hospitals, scientific research institutions, and other aspects. The countryside lacks technicians and medical personnel, and these need support. Factories and communes, schools and communes, and research institutes and communes should be universally "linked up," and plans should be drawn up and achievements should be made.

Comrades working in the countryside and leading agricultural work should be good at grasping typical examples and promoting advanced experiences in agricultural production, especially the experience of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. It should be admitted that our past work in this area has been very insufficient. The masses have created many advanced and successful experiences in practice, but often because of the lack of systematic scientific summary, they have not been seriously studied and promoted, so that some experiences that can indeed be universally promoted have not received the due promotion. Of course, promoting advanced experience is by no means mechanically applying other people's experience. If an advanced experience is to be promoted to various regions, it must be based on different regions, different times, and other different conditions to formulate specific promotion methods, and it must not be rigidly applied from other places. Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us to "adapt to the time and place," and this should be the case when dealing with the Party's instructions, and even more so when dealing with advanced experience. On the agricultural production front, there are now many technical experiences, and because they are technical, they will be particularly different from time to time and from place to place. We must pay attention not to blindly and mechanically apply them. We must follow what Comrade Mao Zedong said in the postscript to an article in the upper volume of *The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside*, *Look, Daquanshan Has Changed!*: "We require every county party secretary to learn from the Yanggao County Party Secretary to carefully seek out the advanced experiences among the local masses, summarize them, and promote them." This means that advanced experience should not first be moved from afar, but should first be sought from the local area.

At present, the people's communes have a lot of experience. Which aspect of experience should we pay attention to first? There is no doubt that we should first pay attention to the successful experiences in the arrangement of labor and organizational leadership. Because the primary key to current agricultural production is to solve the problem of labor in the first line of agriculture, and the second is to solve the problem of agricultural technology. We must make reasonable arrangements for rural labor. The labor force used for agricultural and animal husbandry production should be no less than 60%-65% of the total rural labor force, and it should reach more than 80% for agricultural production during the busy farming season. At present, there are still shortcomings in our work in this regard. In some places, commune-run industries occupy too much labor; in some places, the labor force used in the fields has not reached half. These should be corrected. Rural people's communes should conscientiously abide by the various provisions of the Central Committee of the Party's *Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes*, vigorously strengthen leadership, rectify systems, rectify work style, and conscientiously implement contracted production. On the basis of boosting morale and implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, we should formulate contracted production targets. How many mu of land can one person manage should be discussed by the masses in a realistic manner and determined as the basis for contracted production. During the busy farming season, we must mobilize all forces to fully guarantee the labor force needed for the first line of agricultural production. Urban industrial and capital construction units cannot recruit workers from the countryside at will to ensure that the countryside has sufficient labor. All other departments and units in the city should strictly save labor without exception and resolutely transfer the labor saved to the countryside to strengthen the first line of agricultural production. All those who are able to participate in agricultural labor should be determined to engage in glorious agricultural production for a long time. Many cadres who go to work at the grassroots level in the countryside must eat, live, work, and discuss with the peasant masses, and should never regard themselves as special. As long as we are all determined to do so, our country's agriculture will have great hope, the worker-peasant alliance will be unprecedentedly consolidated and developed, and the socialist cause will achieve even greater victories.

(III) Only in Our Era Is It Possible for Agriculture to Truly "Pass the Test"

Our country has been known as a "country based on agriculture" since ancient times, and many thinkers and politicians have attached importance to agriculture. The *Zuo Zhuan* records that? Duke Wen advised King Xuan of Zhou, saying: "The great matter of the people lies in agriculture." During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, there was a "School of Agriculture" among the various schools of thought. This can be regarded as the ancient Chinese school of thought that valued agriculture, about two thousand years earlier than the physiocrats of Europe in the eighteenth century. At that time, Guan Zhong was able to make the State of Qi dominate. An important reason was that he paid attention to the development of agriculture. He said, "A rich country and sufficient grain come from agriculture, so the former kings valued it." He also said, "If the people have nowhere to roam and eat, they will inevitably farm. If the people engage in agriculture, the fields will be reclaimed. If the fields are reclaimed, the grain will be sufficient. If the grain is sufficient, the country will be rich." Shang Yang's reform promoted the strength of the State of Qin. He also attached great importance to agriculture. He once said: "If one person lives off the labor of one hundred farmers, the country will be king. If one person lives off the labor of ten farmers, the country will be strong. If one person lives off the labor of half farmers, the country will be in danger." The meaning is that the more people in a country engaged in agriculture and the fewer people who do not engage in production, the stronger the country will be. Attaching importance to agriculture has a deep tradition in our country's history. However, China's history has never solved the problem of agriculture. The "country based on agriculture" of China has been called "hungry China" for thousands of years in the past. Under the heavy oppression of long-term feudal exploitation and the later semi-feudal and semi-colonial system, Chinese peasants completely lost any power to resist natural disasters. According to literature records, China's natural disasters, from 1766 BC to before the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, lasted about 3,700 years, with more than 5,200 disasters, averaging about one disaster every six months. Among them, floods accounted for the first place, and droughts accounted for the second place, with a total of 2,132 times. Moreover, the closer the time, the more frequent the disasters. This phenomenon is understandable, because the ancient records were extremely incomplete, and many disasters were omitted. However, these past records are generally reliable. They are not only sufficient to illustrate the objective reality, but also will not exceed the objective real severity. On the contrary, they will only reduce the actual disaster situation more.

Among the records of disasters in the past, what is particularly worthy of our attention is the four provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan in northern China, which have always been the areas with the most disasters and therefore the most severely affected. Among them, Hebei is the most serious, followed by Henan, followed by Shandong, and then Shanxi. According to ancient books, these provinces and regions often encountered natural disasters in the past, often "thousands of miles of barrenness, and the population was cut off." That tragic scene is unimaginable for our current generation of young people. Throughout the ages, in order to overcome the serious difficulties caused by natural disasters, although various disaster relief measures have been taken, they were limited by historical conditions and could only think of many passive methods, but few active policies. It was not until modern times that the vast number of peasants in our country still lived in dark years, suffering from the layers of oppression of landlords, bureaucrats, warlords, and comprador bourgeoisie. They were generally mired in the misery of crying for hunger and cold on weekdays; and once they encountered famine, they sold their sons and daughters and died in the ravines. Especially during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, according to statistics, floods and droughts continued year after year, with an average of 35 million disaster victims every year. It is not difficult to understand why China, such an ancient agricultural country, has not solved the problem of agriculture for thousands of years.

Today, only today in the new era of the people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the Chinese proletariat, only under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, is it possible for the people of our country to completely solve the problem of agriculture and strive for agriculture to "pass the test" as soon as possible. What is the standard for agriculture to "pass the test"? Generally speaking, agriculture will be considered to have "passed the test" when the forty articles of the agricultural development outline are fully realized. However, before the forty articles of the outline are fully realized, there can be partial "passing the test," that is, realizing the standards of the "outline" one by one; there can also be preliminary "passing the test," that is, approaching the standards stipulated in the "outline" in several major projects. Over the past ten years, agriculture in our country has made great progress. In the past two years, agriculture in our country has leaped forward at an unprecedented speed. Despite the fact that natural disasters have continued to strike us over the years. Taking last year as an example, floods and droughts were both very serious. This year, many provinces have been dry for more than 100 days, some for nearly 200 days, and there have been floods in the Northeast and the South. However, because we have built many large and small water conservancy projects in recent years, especially with the people's commune system of "large in size and public in nature," the peasant masses have exerted great revolutionary enthusiasm and fought against natural disasters, creating amazing achievements. Of course, we cannot say now that the grain problem has been solved and agriculture has "passed the test." We still have to make great efforts to strive to achieve this goal in a relatively short period of time.

Our efforts to strengthen the first line of agricultural production are undoubtedly a necessary measure to realize the forty articles of the agricultural development outline, to enable agriculture in our country to "pass the test" as soon as possible, and to enable socialist construction in our country to continue to leap forward. All factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, organizations, troops, schools, and street residents should understand the importance of strengthening the first line of agricultural production, and everyone should do their best to strengthen the first line of agricultural production. We must develop a social atmosphere of valuing agricultural labor in all aspects. In particular, young people should learn from Xing Yanzi in Hebei Province and act as pioneers in building our country's new socialist countryside.

It can be asserted that as long as we earnestly study and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on agricultural issues and resolutely implement it in action, we will certainly be able to promote the continued leap forward of agricultural production in our country, thereby promoting the development of the entire national economy, and build China into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern scientific culture more quickly.

    在农业生产第一线上贯彻实现毛泽东思想
    邓拓
    我们大家都正在努力加强农业生产的第一线，随着许多干部和工作人员到农村去，把毛泽东同志关于农业问题的全部思想带到农业生产的第一线，让这个光辉的思想在我们今后长期的劳动和工作中全部贯彻实现，这就是摆在我们面前的首要任务。
    毛泽东同志关于农业问题的全部思想，内容非常丰富，其中贯串着一条红线，即以农业为国民经济发展的基础；沿着这一条思想红线，我们可以系统地了解毛泽东同志怎样生动地将马克思列宁主义的农业理论，富有创造性地运用到我国农业的实际中来，系统地总结了中国农业的丰富经验，提炼为新的理论，从而使马克思列宁主义的农业理论得到新的发展。
    应该从那几点上去掌握毛泽东同志发展了的马克思列宁主义的农业理论呢？我以为有这样几点：
    第一，在社会主义建设总路线指导下，发展工业和发展农业应该同时并举，并以工业为主导，以农业为基础；
    第二，农业发展的速度应该与工业发展的速度相适应，在发展重工业的同时，充分注意发展农业和轻工业；
    第三，在一定的条件下，应该使农业由使用畜力农具的小规模的经营跃进到使用机器的大规模的经营；
    第四，农业是工业的市场，不但轻工业要以农业为市场，而且重工业也要以农业为重要市场；
    第五，实行农业“八字宪法”是保证农业生产迅速发展的一个重要关键；
    第六，建立和健全人民公社制度，加强党的领导，注意整社工作，注意抓生产又抓生活，妥善安排劳动力，是迅速发展农业的根本保证。
    以上六点当然不能包括毛泽东同志关于农业问题的全部思想，但是这些却是毛泽东同志对于马克思列宁主义的农业理论的重要发展，应该特别加以阐明，以指导我们今后长期在农业战线上的各种实际行动。
    （一）马克思列宁主义的农业理论的重要发展
    为什么说毛泽东同志关于农业问题的这些思想是对于马克思列宁主义农业理论的新的重要发展呢？大家知道，农业是国民经济发展的基础，这个道理在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作中都有所论述。毛泽东同志不但把这个理论加以具体化，运用到中国，概括了中国的经验，使这个理论更加丰富，许多提法更加明确具体，而且提出了新的论点，新的命题，为这个理论增加了重要的新内容。
    马克思在《资本论》第三卷中说：“超越劳动者个人需要的农业劳动生产率，是一切社会的基础，尤其是资本主义生产的基础。”这里说的“一切社会”当然包括社会主义和共产主义社会在内。恩格斯在《家庭、私有制和国家的起源》一书中，曾指出农业在古代社会（指奴隶社会）是有决定意义的生产部门。列宁在《俄国资本主义的发展》一书中也指出农业是有决定性的生产部门。在十月革命以后，特别是在1920—1922年间，列宁几次讲到，要恢复和发展国民经济，基础是粮食生产。1921年5月在俄共（布）第十次全国代表会议上，列宁着重地说：“现在，如果不能保证国家获得大约四亿普特的粮食，就谈不到什么大工业和社会主义建设。”同年11月在莫斯科省第一次农业代表大会上的演说中，列宁又说：“目前整个形势所提出的基本问题，我们共和国国内外政策的首要问题，就是发展全部经济，首先是发展农业的问题。”我们不能把这些话仅仅了解成是列宁针对当时俄国粮食问题比较紧张的情况说的，而应该看到这些话的更广泛更深刻的意义。斯大林1928年在《论国家工业化和联共（布）党内的右倾》的演说中说：“如果说工业是主脑，那末农业就是工业发展的基础，因为农业是吸收工业品的市场，是原料和粮食的供应者，是为输入设备以满足国民经济需要所必需的出口物资后备的来源。如果让农业仍然处在技术十分落后的状态中，如果不保证工业有农业基础，不改造农业，不使农业跟上工业，那末能不能把工业向前推进呢？不，不能。”斯大林在这里明确地提出了“工业是主脑，那末农业就是工业发展的基础”，但是还没有说农业是整个国民经济发展的基础。
    毛泽东同志在我国的历史条件下，把马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林关于农业问题的这些论点大大地向前发展了。人们都知道，毛泽东同志一向重视农业在国民经济中的地位。1934年在《我们的经济政策》的论文中，他说：“农业生产是我们经济建设工作的第一位”。1945年在《必须学会做经济工作》的讲话中，毛泽东同志也着重地讲了农业问题。同年，在党的第七次全国代表大会的报告中，毛泽东同志又进一步地全面地阐明了农业在整个国民经济中的重要性。1950年在《中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第二次会议闭幕词》中，他更强调地说：“中国的主要人口是农民，革命靠了农民的援助才取得了胜利，国家工业化又要靠农民的援助才能成功。”后来，在《关于农业合作化问题》、《中国农村的社会主义高潮》的序言和批语中，特别是在《关于十大关系》和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的报告中，在多次的讲话中，毛泽东同志都一再地阐述了农业在国民经济中的重要地位和作用。不但这样，毛泽东同志还从农业的根本问题上提出了一系列新的理论。
    社会主义国民经济的发展要以农业为基础，以工业为主导；要把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来，要实行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，这是毛泽东同志在《关于十大关系》的报告和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的报告中明确地提出的。这个方针后来成为我们党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针的最重要内容之一。
    毛泽东同志早就预见到中国的社会主义建设将是高速度的。在《关于农业合作化问题》和《中国农村的社会主义高潮》的序言和批语中，他批判了有些人认为农业的改造和发展的速度只能是缓慢的那种右倾观点。这种观点，在一个相当的期间曾被认为是不可动摇的，毛泽东同志彻底推翻了这个观点，提出了农业发展可以是高速度的，可以与工业的发展相适应的这样一个新的观点。在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中，毛泽东同志又指出，在发展重工业的同时要充分注意发展农业和轻工业，他说：“这样，看起来工业化的速度似乎慢一些，但是实际上不会慢，或者反而可能快一些。”我国1958年以来的工农业大跃进的光辉成就，有力地证明了毛泽东同志在工农业发展速度问题上的这个马克思列宁主义的新论断是完全正确的。
    关于农业从小生产向大生产跃进的观点，显然也是以前马克思列宁主义经典著作中没有说过的。人们都知道，封建社会的农业是个体小生产。到资本主义社会有了资本主义的大农场，但是资本主义并不一定要全部消灭小农经济，甚至于在某些地方还要特意保留小农经济，以利于资本主义大农场吸取临时的雇佣劳动和进行其他榨取。马克思主义者主张在推翻资本主义制度之后，用社会主义改造的办法把小农经济改造为现代化的大生产。这是适应历史发展要求的革命步骤，也是一种必然趋势。问题是，农业的小生产向大生产的过渡是逐渐地缓慢地进行呢，还是可以跃进的呢？毛泽东同志在《关于农业合作化问题》中指出，在社会主义制度之下，我们完全可以使“农业由使用畜力农具的小规模的经营跃进到使用机器的大规模的经营”。这里所说的跃进，包含着两层意思，一是由使用畜力农具跃进到使用农业机器；一是由小规模的农业跃进到大规模的农业。这两点是有联系的，又是有所区别的，它们并不一定就是一回事情。当我们有了大批农业机器，用以代替畜力农具的时候，农业经营自然就由小规模的变为大规模的，这个道理很容易理解；问题还在于没有农业机器，能不能使农业经营由小规模的跃进到大规模的呢？曾经有人认为，必须先有大量的机械来装备农业，然后才能实行农业的合作化。毛泽东同志根据我国的情况，指出我们要走的是“先合作化，后机械化”的道路。在毛泽东同志的这个伟大思想的指引下，我国的农业以惊人的速度实现了全面的合作化和人民公社化，这就为将来我国农业的机械化开辟了广阔的道路。
    在农业走向机械化的过程中，工业特别是重工业，必须以日益增多的生产资料供应农业的需要。人们过去往往只注意到轻工业要以日益增多的各种生活资料供应农村，只注意到农村是轻工业品的市场，而对于发展农业和发展重工业的关系却没有全面的了解。有的人甚至认为要发展重工业就要削弱农业，要发展农业就要削弱重工业。毛泽东同志全面地分析了工业和农业的关系，特别指出农村也是重工业的市场，这是非常重要的新论点。在《关于农业合作化问题》的报告中，毛泽东同志指出：“社会主义工业化的一个最重要的部门——重工业，它的拖拉机的生产，它的其他农业机器的生产，它的化学肥料的生产，它的供农业使用的现代化运输工具的生产，它的供农业使用的煤油和电力的生产等等，所有这些，只有在农业已经形成了合作化的大规模经营的基础上才有使用的可能。”在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中，他更清楚地指出：“重工业要以农业为重要市场这一点，目前还没有使人们看得很清楚。但是随着农业的技术改造逐步发展，农业的日益现代化，为农业服务的机械、肥料、水利建设、电力建设、运输建设、民用燃料、民用建筑材料等等将日益增多，重工业以农业为重要市场的情况，将会易于为人们所理解。”这样，农业是重工业的市场的原理就为优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合的方针奠定了坚实的理论基础。
    为了迅速发展我国的农业生产，毛泽东同志还提出了著名的农业“八字宪法”。土、肥、水、密、种、保、管、工这八个字概括了农业生产的各个方面，形成了我国农业增产措施的一个完整体系。在这八个字所表现的八个方面之间存在着不可分割的辩证的联系，它们在整个农业生产的过程中，随着农业季节的推移和各种农活的不同，也往往变换重点。我们对于农业“八字宪法”不但应该重视其中包含的我国农业生产的丰富经验，而且应该善于运用它来促进解决生产关系和生产力之间的关系问题。我们可以看到在农业“八字宪法”中有一些方面在执行的时候，不可避免地要涉及到人和人的关系，涉及到生产队和公社的关系。至于实行农业“八字宪法”的结果，引起了生产力的发展或飞跃，最后也必然要冲击生产关系，使它不能不继续向前发展，以适应生产力的要求。
    但是，系统地解决农业生产力和生产关系问题的最重要武器还是毛泽东同志关于农村人民公社的理论。人民公社是我国人民的伟大创造，是马克思列宁主义理论在中国社会主义建设实践中的重要结晶；毛泽东同志关于人民公社的理论全面地发展了马克思列宁主义。这个理论对于农业方面的实践更起了直接的指导作用。这个理论具体地表现在中共中央关于农村人民公社问题的决议中。1958年12月10日，党的八届六中全会通过的《关于人民公社若干问题的决议》着重地向我们指出：“生产关系一定要适合生产力的性质，只有生产力发展到某种状况才会引起生产关系的某种变革，这是马克思主义的一条基本原理。同志们要记着，我国现在的生产力发展水平，毕竟还是很低的。苦战三年，加上再努力若干年，全国的经济面貌可以有一个很大的改变，但是那时离开全国高度工业化、全国农业机械化电气化的目标，还将有一段不小的距离；至于离开社会产品大大丰富、劳动强度大大减轻、劳动时间大大缩短这些目标，就还有一段更长的距离。”因此决议要求在今后相当时期内，要用大力整顿人民公社，建立和健全各种制度，加强党的领导，使新的生产关系更加适应生产力发展的需要。对于生产关系的三大部分，即所有制、人与人在劳动过程中的关系、分配制度等的原则问题，决议都做了明确的规定。对于在生产关系和生产力中间始终起着决定性作用的人，决议特别给予最大的重视。决议写道：“人民公社是人民的生产和生活的组织者，而发展生产的根本目的是最大限度地满足全体社会成员经常增长的物质和文化生活的需要。党在领导公社工作的时候，必须注意全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活。必须关心人，纠正那种见物不见人的倾向。群众的干劲越大，党越要关心群众生活。党越是关心群众生活，群众的干劲也会越大。”这对于我们的实际工作始终具有非常重大的意义。
    （二）让崭新的理论在实践中产生巨大的物质力量
    当前我们的任务就是要百倍加强农业生产的第一线，用长期艰苦的努力，去争取贯彻实现毛泽东同志关于农业问题的全部思想，把他的每一个主张都变成为事实。我们应该深刻地认识毛泽东同志在农业理论问题上对马克思列宁主义的重要发展。我们要把这个崭新的理论用来指导我们的实际工作，让这个从实践中来的理论再回到实践中去，与广大群众的实际行动相结合，从而使这个理论更进一步掌握群众，成为无比巨大的物质力量。我们也只有提高了对这些理论的认识水平，并且以此为武器，检查我们过去的工作，总结已有的经验，我们今后才能够在农业生产的第一线上全面地贯彻实现毛泽东同志关于农业问题的思想。
    两年来，我们执行了工业和农业同时并举的方针，使工业和农业都以前所未有的速度向前跃进。虽然我国农业发展的速度和工业发展的速度还有相当大的距离，但是经过不断的努力，我们一定能够使这个距离日益缩短，一定能够使农业发展的速度与工业发展的速度相适应。
    有的同志认为，既然要“工业和农业同时并举”，就应该马上使农业和工业具有同样的发展速度，得到同样程度的装备，不这样，就不叫“并举”。这种想法是不现实的，也是错误的。“并举”并不意味着绝对的平衡发展。大家知道，农业生产比起工业生产具有根本不同的特点，农作物和牲畜生长的规律有许多是现时人力所不能完全控制的；而且自然条件又在许多方面起着支配作用，使农业生产很难稳定。因此，要使农业马上同工业平衡发展是不可能的。至于另外有的同志片面地强调“农业是基础”，而忽视工业、商业和文教事业，这当然也是不对的。“农业是基础”不等于“农业本位”论，不是提倡什么“农本主义”。我们重视农业，并不是孤立地强调农业，而是从整个国民经济着眼，看到农业的重要作用。我们重视农业是因为，农业提供粮食，提供工业原料（占全部工业原料的40％，轻工业原料的80％）；农业是国家积累的一个重要来源（它直接间接提供的财政收入为全部财政收入的50％以上）；农产品是我国重要的出口商品（目前占出口总额的73％），可以换取我们所需要的一部分机械设备；农业又是劳动力的重要来源（近两年工业职工增加了两千万人，绝大部分来自农村）。离开了农业对整个国民经济的这些作用，孤立地强调发展农业，这并不符合农业是国民经济发展的基础这个原理。
    这些年来，我们集中主要的力量发展重工业，使工业得到高速度的发展是完全正确的。我国原有的工业基础十分薄弱，不大力发展工业，就不能根本改变“五亿人口搞饭吃”的落后局面。说得精确一点，农村五亿人口约有劳动力二亿。二亿人给六亿人搞饭吃，一个人只养三个人，这是十分落后的局面。我们将来必须争取做到一个人养五个人，养十个人，这样就可以腾出一亿以上的劳动力投入工业。我们重视农业，要使农业发展的速度与工业发展的速度相适应，正是为了将来能够腾出力量来大大发展工业，根本改变我国的落后面貌。
    我们说农业是基础，就是说农业是基本生活资料的来源，是劳动力再生产的依靠，是整个国民经济发展的基地和出发点。这个基础巩固了，其他事业才不会动摇。过去几年来的经验说明，凡是头一年农业得到丰收，第二年基本建设就可以多“上马”，工业生产的原料就有保证。这正是显示出“基础”的作用。同时，我们说“工业是主导”，意思就是说，我们的整个社会主义经济要不断向前发展，要建设共产主义，光有强大的基础还不够，必须有前进的龙头，这就是工业。旧中国农业生产衰败，工业基础薄弱，人民不得不吃糠咽菜，不得不受帝国主义的欺负。解放了，我国人民有雄心壮志要建设社会主义的强国，要登上共产主义的天堂，如果只有农业这个基础，如果没有工业这个龙头，那怎么行呢！
    有人问：是不是将来工业大发展了，就可以不要农业这个基础了？不是。农业永远是基础，永远是整个国民经济的根本依靠。不过，农业的面貌是要发生根本变化的。将来作为国民经济基础的农业是高度现代化的农业，是工业化了的农业。从这个方面讲，我们今后要做的事情还很多。
    中心问题是要加快农业发展的速度。几年来我们已经实现了农业的大跃进，并使农业和工业的比例更加合理。工业和农业增长的比例，在我国第一个五年计划时期为四比一，1958年为二点六五比一，1959年为二点三五比一，可见，我们正在实现毛泽东同志所提出的农业发展的速度要和工业发展的速度相适应的指示。可以预料，今后工业和农业增长的比例还会更加合理，使工农业更好地互相促进。
    我们还要努力创造条件，促进我国农业从畜力农具的小规模经营向着农业机器的大规模经营跃进。随着我国农民个体经济向农业合作社和人民公社的跃进，我国农业经营的规模已经不断地扩大了。北京郊区在解放之初，有六个资本主义农场，每个场不过二三百亩地。当时普遍存在的是个体小生产。解放以后，经过合作化运动，特别是在实现了人民公社化以后，情形完全不同了。现在郊区有的人民公社有八千二百亩连成一片的大块耕地。从全国来看，公社化以后，几百亩、上千亩的大块耕地是相当普遍存在的。经营地块的扩大，从一个侧面说明，生产关系的改变必然促进经营方法的改变。当然，我们在这一方面还不能要求太高，因为目前我国农业经营的集约程度还不够高，也就是说，在每一单位面积上投入的资力（包括设备、肥料等）还比较少，与投入的活劳动力相比还占着较小的比重。借用马克思分析资本构成的话来说，这就是“技术构成”还比较低。这是我国农业劳动生产率比较低的根本原因。只有随着农业技术改造工作的进展，这种情况才会逐渐发生根本的变化。我们的任务就是要促进这个变化。
    为了提高农业的技术水平，争取在条件具备时实现农业的机械化，供应农村的生产资料应该大大增加。而这些生产资料基本上都是重工业的产品。从这里我们可以深刻地体会到毛泽东同志关于农业和重工业互相促进的思想。重工业面向农村，支援农村，为农业机械化服务，实际上也是大大发展了重工业本身。城市重工业生产部门应该担负起以机械武装郊区农村的任务。照北京市的情况来说，现时工业的比重很大，因此，我们应该有信心在较快的时间内在像北京这样大城市的郊区实现农业的机械化。应该看到，我国社会主义的经济建设决不可能允许先进的工业和落后的农业之间的矛盾现象长期存在。如果我们长期不解决这个矛盾，那么，我国整个国民经济发展的速度就将受到严重的障碍，我国的工农联盟在新条件下的巩固与发展也将受到不利的影响。
    如果说，全国对于农业机械化的要求是“四年小解决，七年中解决，十年大解决”，那末，像北京这样的大城市就应该较快一些，可能在四年内实现农业机械化。这就需要城市各方面对农村加强援助。城市工厂不仅要有计划地接受农业生产资料的订货，而且要帮助农村人民公社办修配厂，替他们培训技术工人。城市还要帮助郊区实现水利化，帮助郊区办化肥厂。以技术和装备援助农业，不仅是工业部门的责任，而且是学校、医院、科学研究机关以及其他各方面共同的责任。农村缺少技术人员、医务人员，这些都需要支援。厂社、校社、院社等要普遍“挂钩”，订出计划，做出成绩。
    在农村工作的同志和农村工作领导机关应该善于抓住典型，推广农业生产的先进经验，特别是关于农业“八字宪法”的经验。应该承认我们在这个方面过去工作是做得很不够的，群众在实践中已经创造了许多先进的成功的经验，常常因为缺乏系统的科学总结，没有认真地加以研究和推广，以致有些的确可以普遍推广的经验，一直得不到应有的推广。当然，推广先进经验决不是机械地搬用别人的经验。一种先进经验要想推广到各个地区去，一定要根据不同的地区、不同的时间和其他不同的条件，拟出具体的推广办法，决不能生硬地套用别处的办法。毛泽东同志常常教导我们要“因时因地制宜”，对待党的指示应该这样，对待先进经验更应该这样。在农业生产战线上，现在有许多技术经验，因为它们是技术性的，就特别会因时因地而不同，我们必须注意不要盲目地机械搬用。我们要按照毛泽东同志在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》上册的一篇文章《看，大泉山变了样子！》的按语中所说的：“要求每个县委书记都学阳高县委书记那样，用心寻找当地群众中的先进经验，加以总结，使之推广。”这就是说，先进经验首先不是到远处去搬，而应该首先从当地寻找。
    现时人民公社已经有了很多经验，我们首先应该注意那一方面的经验呢？毫无疑问，我们首先应该注意关于劳动力的安排和组织领导方面的成功经验。因为当前农业生产的首要关键，是要解决农业第一线的劳动力问题，其次才是解决农业技术问题。我们必须对农村劳动力做合理的安排，用于农业和牧畜业生产的劳动力，应该不少于全部农村劳动力的60％—65％，在农忙季节用于农业生产的则应该达到80％以上。目前在这方面我们工作中还有缺点。有的地方社办工业占用劳动力过多；有的地方用在田间的劳动力还没有达到一半。这都是应该纠正的。农村人民公社要切实遵照党中央《关于人民公社若干问题的决议》中的各项规定，大力加强领导，整顿制度，整顿作风，认真实行包产。要在鼓足干劲，执行农业“八字宪法”的基础上制定包产指标，一个人能管几亩地，应该实事求是地经过群众讨论，确定下来，作为包产的依据。在农忙时，要动员各方面力量，全力保证农业生产第一线所需要的劳动力。城市工业和基本建设单位不能随便从农村招收工人，以保证农村有足够的劳动力。城市其他一切部门和一切单位，都应该无例外地严格节约劳动力，把节省出来的劳动力坚决调到农村去，加强农业生产的第一线。凡是有条件参加农业劳动的人，都应该下决心长期从事光荣的农业生产。有许多干部到农村基层去工作，必须与农民群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，决不应该自居特殊。只要我们大家下决心这样做，我国农业就大有希望，工农联盟就会得到空前的巩固与发展，社会主义事业就会获得更加伟大的胜利。
    （三）只有在我们这个时代农业才有可能真正“过关”
    我国自古号称“以农立国”，许多思想家和政治家都重视农业。左传记载?文公谏周宣王，说：“夫民之大事在农”。春秋战国时，诸子百家之中有“农家”，这可以看作是中国古代的重农学派，比欧洲十八世纪的重农学派约早两千年。当时管仲能够使齐国称霸，一个重要的原因是注重农业的发展。他说，“夫富国足粟生于农，故先王贵之。”又说，“民无所游食，则必农，民事农则田垦，田垦则粟足，粟足则国富。”商鞅变法，促进了秦国的强大。他也是很重视农业的，他曾经说：“百人农一人居者，王；十人农一人居者，强；半农半居者，危。”意思是说一个国家从事农业的人口越多，不事生产的人越少，国家就会越强。重视农业，在我国历史上是有深厚的传统的。但是，中国历史上从来没有解决过农业问题。“以农立国”的中国，过去几千年来却被人称为“饥饿的中国”。在长期的封建剥削和后来的半封建半殖民地制度的重重压迫下，中国农民根本丧失了抵抗自然灾害的任何力量。据文献记载，中国的自然灾害，从公元前1766年算起，到公元1937年抗日战争之前为止，约三千七百年左右，成灾五千二百多次，平均约每半年就有一次灾荒。其中水灾占了第一位，旱灾占了第二位，两项合计共有二千一百三十二次，而且时间越靠近，灾害的次数越多。这种现象是可以理解的，因为古代的记录极不完全，许多灾荒被遗漏了。但是过去这些记载是大体可靠的，它不但足以说明客观的实际情况而且决不会超过客观真实的严重程度，反而只会比实际的灾情减轻得多。
    在历代灾害的记载中，特别值得我们注意的，是我国北方的晋、冀、鲁、豫四省，历来都是灾害最多因而受灾最重的地区。其中又以河北为最严重，河南次之，山东又次之，山西再次之，据古书记述，这些省区从前遇有天灾，常常“千里荒芜，人烟断绝”。那种悲惨的景象是我们现在青年一代人所无法想像的。历代的人们为了克服自然灾害所造成的严重困难，虽然采取了各种救灾的措施，然而他们受了历史条件的限制，只能想出许多消极的办法，却很少积极的方针。一直到了近代，我国广大农民还是生活在黑暗的年月里，饱受了地主、官僚、军阀、买办资产阶级的层层压榨，他们平日已经普遍地陷于啼饥号寒的苦境；而一旦遇到灾荒，就卖儿卖女、转死沟壑。特别是在国民党反动统治时期，据统计，水旱灾害连年不断，平均每年有灾民三千五百万人。这就不难理解，为什么中国这样古老的农业国，几千年来农业问题却一直没有解决。
    今天，只有今天在中国无产阶级领导的人民民主专政的新时代，只有在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我国人民才有了可能完全解决农业问题，争取农业早日“过关”。农业“过关”的标准是什么呢？总的说来，农业发展纲要四十条完全实现的时候，农业就算“过关”了。但是，在四十条纲要还没有完全实现的时候，既可以有部分的“过关”，即一项一项地实现“纲要”的标准；也可以有初步的“过关”，即在若干主要项目上接近于“纲要”所规定的标准。十年来，我国农业已经有了很大发展。最近两年我国农业更以空前的速度向前跃进。尽管这些年来，自然灾害仍然是不停地向我们袭击。就以去年来说，水旱灾害都很严重。今年许多省份干旱一百多天，有的近二百天，东北和南方又有涝灾。但是，由于我们几年来建筑了许多大大小小的水利工程，特别是有了“一大二公”的人民公社制度，农民群众发挥了巨大的革命干劲，与天灾作斗争，创造了惊人成绩。当然，我们现在还不能说粮食问题已经解决，农业已经“过关”了。我们还要经过巨大的努力才有可能争取在比较短的时间内达到这个目的。
    我们用大力加强农业生产第一线，这无疑地是为实现农业发展纲要四十条，使我国农业早日“过关”，使我国社会主义建设继续跃进而应当采取的必要措施。一切厂矿、企业、机关、团体、部队、学校以及街道居民，人人都应该懂得加强农业生产第一线的重要意义，人人都应该为加强农业生产第一线而尽力。我们要从各方面养成一种重视农业劳动的社会风气。特别是青年人应该向河北省的邢燕子学习，充当建设我国社会主义新农村的先锋战士。
    可以断定，只要我们认真地学习和运用毛泽东同志关于农业问题的理论，并且在行动中坚决地加以贯彻实现，我们就一定能够促进我国农业生产的继续跃进，并从而促进整个国民经济的发展，更快地把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国。
